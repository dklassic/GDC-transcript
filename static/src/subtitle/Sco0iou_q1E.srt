1
00:00:06,421 --> 00:00:08,342
All right, welcome to an architectural approach

2
00:00:08,342 --> 00:00:11,144
to level design, creating an art theory for game worlds,

3
00:00:11,144 --> 00:00:13,085
and so can you.

4
00:00:13,085 --> 00:00:15,287
I'm Chris Totten, and before we get started,

5
00:00:15,287 --> 00:00:19,289
I want to ask everybody to please silence cell phones,

6
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:21,931
please fill out the electronic evals,

7
00:00:21,931 --> 00:00:24,633
and if people start needing seats,

8
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,394
please move towards the center of your rows.

9
00:00:27,382 --> 00:00:29,503
So, who is this guy?

10
00:00:29,503 --> 00:00:32,366
I have my own indie game studio.

11
00:00:32,366 --> 00:00:40,512
I use this studio to publish research that I've done on games and the arts and humanities,

12
00:00:40,512 --> 00:00:43,635
and you're going to see that's a big theme of my work.

13
00:00:44,175 --> 00:00:46,377
I work with museums to showcase games.

14
00:00:46,377 --> 00:00:52,040
My latest thing is the Smithsonian American Art Museum Arcade, which is an indie event

15
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:54,941
at Smithsonian in Washington, D.C.

16
00:00:54,941 --> 00:01:03,126
This year's theme is game spaces, so if you level designers who are indie have any cool

17
00:01:03,126 --> 00:01:06,307
games to show off with great level design, please submit.

18
00:01:06,307 --> 00:01:08,368
Funny how that worked out, that I was...

19
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:11,377
speaking at level design this year.

20
00:01:11,377 --> 00:01:15,482
I teach game development and I have two degrees in architecture.

21
00:01:17,288 --> 00:01:19,230
I've also published two books on level design.

22
00:01:19,230 --> 00:01:25,094
The first is an architectural approach to level design, which analyzes game worlds according

23
00:01:25,094 --> 00:01:27,875
to architectural theory and spatial psychology.

24
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:34,540
I have also published and edited a, well it's an edited volume, called Level Design Processes

25
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:40,924
and Experiences, where lovely people from the industry wrote about what they do when

26
00:01:40,924 --> 00:01:45,067
they design levels, and let me put it into a book.

27
00:01:45,067 --> 00:01:45,267
So.

28
00:01:46,614 --> 00:01:50,845
This is not a book talk, though, where I summarize the information in the book.

29
00:01:50,845 --> 00:01:53,311
You should still buy my book.

30
00:01:55,012 --> 00:01:56,452
but I'm not gonna summarize it.

31
00:01:56,452 --> 00:01:59,713
I'm going to talk about, this is a call to action talk.

32
00:01:59,713 --> 00:02:03,535
This is a motivational talk that hopefully

33
00:02:03,535 --> 00:02:06,316
if any of you are on the fence on,

34
00:02:06,316 --> 00:02:09,817
you know, I'm a level designer and I have a lot of thoughts

35
00:02:09,817 --> 00:02:11,978
about level design and I have a cool process,

36
00:02:11,978 --> 00:02:13,798
how do I share it with the world?

37
00:02:13,798 --> 00:02:16,699
Well, we're gonna talk about it today.

38
00:02:16,699 --> 00:02:20,681
So, the topics are, why did I write about level design?

39
00:02:21,607 --> 00:02:28,333
the benefits of sharing your techniques, how to choose your topics and do level design

40
00:02:28,333 --> 00:02:33,017
analysis, and what I learned by sharing my own work.

41
00:02:33,017 --> 00:02:39,142
So first, why in the world did I write about level design?

42
00:02:39,142 --> 00:02:39,182
So

43
00:02:39,764 --> 00:02:45,167
But when I was in school, I started making my own games, and this was around the time

44
00:02:45,167 --> 00:02:49,749
that a lot of really great books on game design were coming out, including things like Rules

45
00:02:49,749 --> 00:02:55,652
of Play, things that looked at game design as one would fields of classical design.

46
00:02:55,652 --> 00:03:00,215
And I was in architecture school learning architecture theory, seeing game designers

47
00:03:00,215 --> 00:03:03,336
talk about architecture theory in game design books, and I was like,

48
00:03:03,457 --> 00:03:06,558
They're the same, yes!

49
00:03:06,558 --> 00:03:10,120
And I started blending architecture theory

50
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:13,222
and game design theory in my school projects,

51
00:03:13,222 --> 00:03:15,524
which culminated in my thesis,

52
00:03:15,524 --> 00:03:17,525
where I turned architecture into a game

53
00:03:17,525 --> 00:03:19,706
and had students play the game

54
00:03:19,706 --> 00:03:21,707
to design their school projects.

55
00:03:21,707 --> 00:03:25,870
I also analyzed game worlds as pieces of architecture.

56
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:27,891
So that was the beginning of a career path,

57
00:03:27,891 --> 00:03:30,793
understatement of the decade.

58
00:03:30,793 --> 00:03:30,853
So.

59
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:35,956
When I got out of architecture school

60
00:03:35,956 --> 00:03:38,497
and got into game development,

61
00:03:38,497 --> 00:03:41,597
I noticed that books on game design kept coming out.

62
00:03:41,597 --> 00:03:43,618
A lot of books on game design,

63
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,879
and a lot of books on game design as a general field,

64
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,100
but not really books that dove into anything else

65
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:52,620
that contributed to games.

66
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:54,980
So I study a lot of art.

67
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,761
I didn't see anything that looked at.

68
00:03:57,121 --> 00:04:00,303
the history of art and game art.

69
00:04:00,303 --> 00:04:03,265
Or there's more on music composition now,

70
00:04:03,265 --> 00:04:05,687
but that wasn't coming out for a long time.

71
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:09,810
And there were very few resources on level design

72
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:12,212
that weren't a chapter in a game design book that said,

73
00:04:12,212 --> 00:04:13,953
and sometimes they design levels too.

74
00:04:15,860 --> 00:04:19,261
And I thought that was weird because when I design levels,

75
00:04:19,261 --> 00:04:22,523
I'm not using the same skills when

76
00:04:22,523 --> 00:04:25,865
I design the general game mechanics versus when

77
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:27,466
I work on levels.

78
00:04:27,466 --> 00:04:30,447
I think about things like architecture and perspective

79
00:04:30,447 --> 00:04:33,509
and composition, art and architecture things.

80
00:04:33,509 --> 00:04:35,290
And part of that's my background.

81
00:04:35,290 --> 00:04:38,691
But there's different sides of my brain firing.

82
00:04:40,336 --> 00:04:42,077
That's not true, I think that's the same side of my brain.

83
00:04:42,077 --> 00:04:47,081
But still, it's different ideas firing,

84
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:49,263
and I thought, you know,

85
00:04:49,263 --> 00:04:52,285
these are kind of separate but equal.

86
00:04:52,285 --> 00:04:53,907
And if I treat them as such,

87
00:04:53,907 --> 00:04:57,430
maybe level design has some cool things to say on its own.

88
00:04:59,431 --> 00:05:01,413
And I wasn't the only one saying this.

89
00:05:01,413 --> 00:05:03,154
I would come to GDC, I would read articles,

90
00:05:03,154 --> 00:05:04,555
I would listen to podcasts,

91
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:06,997
and people would be talking about,

92
00:05:06,997 --> 00:05:08,399
you know, this architecture thing?

93
00:05:08,399 --> 00:05:10,681
I bet we'd learn a lot about game design

94
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:14,544
and level design if we looked at architecture.

95
00:05:14,544 --> 00:05:14,704
And...

96
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:18,104
I thought, hey, I know about that stuff,

97
00:05:18,104 --> 00:05:24,071
so why don't I start writing about level design

98
00:05:24,071 --> 00:05:26,894
and architecture, and maybe I can,

99
00:05:26,894 --> 00:05:30,818
that's the way I can make an impact in the industry.

100
00:05:30,818 --> 00:05:32,941
Maybe this is my thing.

101
00:05:32,941 --> 00:05:34,543
So I started doing that.

102
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:38,529
Okay, so that's me.

103
00:05:38,529 --> 00:05:42,392
Let's say you're the person that is on that fence

104
00:05:42,392 --> 00:05:44,233
thinking I have something to say,

105
00:05:44,233 --> 00:05:46,674
I feel like I might have something to say,

106
00:05:46,674 --> 00:05:48,596
what do I do?

107
00:05:48,596 --> 00:05:50,717
So, what do I talk about?

108
00:05:50,717 --> 00:05:54,679
I want you to ask yourselves three questions.

109
00:05:54,679 --> 00:05:56,961
One, what do I take for granted

110
00:05:56,961 --> 00:06:00,123
that isn't documented anywhere?

111
00:06:00,123 --> 00:06:02,945
And I'm going to use the example of

112
00:06:03,421 --> 00:06:10,127
Blocktober, which is a recent hashtag, if you are not familiar, where level designers

113
00:06:10,127 --> 00:06:16,673
tweeted pictures of their grey-blocked levels to the world, and a lot of people thought

114
00:06:16,673 --> 00:06:21,097
it was really cool because they were used to only seeing the finished product, and not

115
00:06:21,097 --> 00:06:28,763
necessarily used to seeing what the process of making a level was, and it, you know, made

116
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:30,905
a lot of light bulbs go off for people.

117
00:06:31,713 --> 00:06:34,176
So looking behind the curtain in this way

118
00:06:34,176 --> 00:06:36,999
is something that we may be very used to.

119
00:06:36,999 --> 00:06:38,641
Some people may even be embarrassed

120
00:06:38,641 --> 00:06:40,443
by their gray box levels.

121
00:06:40,443 --> 00:06:43,146
But it's something that.

122
00:06:43,553 --> 00:06:49,617
People who've never seen this, students, recent new developers,

123
00:06:49,617 --> 00:06:53,300
or even just game players, would get very excited about.

124
00:06:53,300 --> 00:06:57,142
So think about that stuff that is just part of your workflow

125
00:06:57,142 --> 00:06:59,504
that you forgot was novel.

126
00:06:59,504 --> 00:07:01,325
Next, semi-related.

127
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:05,308
What sorts of things have you grokked or internalized so much

128
00:07:05,308 --> 00:07:08,370
that you forgot to learn it, that you had to learn it?

129
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:10,552
I'm a teacher, and I teach software.

130
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:17,552
And when I work in something, like even Photoshop,

131
00:07:17,552 --> 00:07:21,513
when something breaks, my brain goes to this checklist

132
00:07:21,513 --> 00:07:24,693
that I don't even notice it goes to that

133
00:07:24,693 --> 00:07:25,894
solves the problem for me.

134
00:07:25,894 --> 00:07:28,974
I just go through this set of motions.

135
00:07:28,974 --> 00:07:32,515
But I forgot that I had to learn that set of motions

136
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:34,116
to fix my problem.

137
00:07:34,116 --> 00:07:37,436
And somebody who's new, and I see this in my students,

138
00:07:37,436 --> 00:07:38,837
they're like, oh my gosh, it's broken.

139
00:07:38,837 --> 00:07:40,497
It'll never come back.

140
00:07:40,497 --> 00:07:40,977
And.

141
00:07:42,158 --> 00:07:47,763
you have to teach people that thing that you forgot you had to learn and

142
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:52,066
eventually they'll learn it. So think about those things. If there's anything

143
00:07:52,066 --> 00:07:57,251
you do on, again, your day-to-day process, what did you forget was new at some

144
00:07:57,251 --> 00:08:01,935
point? And then what other interests or knowledge do you have that you bring to

145
00:08:01,935 --> 00:08:02,455
your work?

146
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:09,243
Are you into heavy metal music, hiking, cooking, anything?

147
00:08:09,243 --> 00:08:12,224
Take that and then take game or level design

148
00:08:12,224 --> 00:08:14,865
and just kind of smush them together

149
00:08:14,865 --> 00:08:18,427
and you'll probably have some unique perspective

150
00:08:18,427 --> 00:08:21,548
about which to talk about your work.

151
00:08:21,548 --> 00:08:23,349
So an example I like using,

152
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,429
several years ago I made an art history game

153
00:08:25,429 --> 00:08:27,010
called Laziski's Revenge,

154
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:32,172
which is Yar's Revenge plus Russian propaganda art

155
00:08:33,042 --> 00:08:34,843
the video game.

156
00:08:34,843 --> 00:08:39,887
So I made design decisions according to theories

157
00:08:39,887 --> 00:08:41,488
from art history and graphic design,

158
00:08:41,488 --> 00:08:44,030
and the way levels were arranged,

159
00:08:44,030 --> 00:08:46,371
levels were supposed to each actually be

160
00:08:46,371 --> 00:08:49,373
a piece of graphic design art,

161
00:08:49,373 --> 00:08:52,856
but also an interactive level that you could like,

162
00:08:52,856 --> 00:08:54,597
as you play, because you're moving,

163
00:08:54,597 --> 00:08:56,718
shapes are shifting and going,

164
00:08:56,718 --> 00:08:58,460
like crisscrossing each other,

165
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:00,721
and that would make graphic design as you play.

166
00:09:01,792 --> 00:09:10,679
But I took these things that certainly have large bodies of knowledge and did game design

167
00:09:10,679 --> 00:09:11,780
with it.

168
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:19,686
That could be art history and graphic design have whole college courses devoted to them,

169
00:09:19,686 --> 00:09:22,108
have whole majors, whole libraries.

170
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:26,732
And if somebody were to write that book, I'm not writing that book.

171
00:09:26,732 --> 00:09:27,833
You could.

172
00:09:28,840 --> 00:09:30,243
I mean you can get a book out of it.

173
00:09:30,243 --> 00:09:35,371
So there's a lot of stuff out there in the world that you can combine with your work

174
00:09:35,371 --> 00:09:38,376
as a level designer and create content.

175
00:09:40,167 --> 00:09:41,927
So let's say you do have something like that.

176
00:09:41,927 --> 00:09:44,608
Let's say you're thinking, I can go do that now.

177
00:09:44,608 --> 00:09:46,288
Oh crud, what do I do?

178
00:09:46,288 --> 00:09:48,028
How do I organize this?

179
00:09:48,028 --> 00:09:49,549
So I like to borrow a term,

180
00:09:49,549 --> 00:09:52,990
lenses from Jesse Schell's Art of Game Design,

181
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:55,490
which is an awesome book you should read.

182
00:09:55,490 --> 00:10:00,551
So break down your own approach into self-contained steps.

183
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:06,674
and then take each of those steps and then look at your work through just that step.

184
00:10:06,674 --> 00:10:11,995
Don't let any other steps in. And then that's like write everything you can about that. Okay,

185
00:10:11,995 --> 00:10:18,358
that's chapter one. Now take another step. Look at that one. Chapter two or episode two or

186
00:10:19,783 --> 00:10:24,190
I don't know, podcast, well, episode two, video two, whatever.

187
00:10:24,190 --> 00:10:31,342
But that is how you create individual chunks, episodes, videos, et cetera, is you just talk

188
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:34,026
about one thing in detail.

189
00:10:35,632 --> 00:10:38,794
If you're still looking for information,

190
00:10:38,794 --> 00:10:41,236
I like to go on what I call a bibliography raid.

191
00:10:41,236 --> 00:10:43,557
This is something I learned in grad school,

192
00:10:43,557 --> 00:10:47,280
where you take the thing you're inspired by,

193
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:49,842
or if you have a favorite designer

194
00:10:49,842 --> 00:10:52,364
and they talk about their inspirations,

195
00:10:52,364 --> 00:10:55,526
pick up that thing, read it, or watch it,

196
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:58,868
and then see if that inspirational piece

197
00:10:58,868 --> 00:11:01,750
talks about any of their own inspirations.

198
00:11:01,930 --> 00:11:04,772
then go consume that, and then go consume that thing's

199
00:11:04,772 --> 00:11:05,333
inspirations.

200
00:11:05,333 --> 00:11:07,775
Eventually, you'll find your way looping back

201
00:11:07,775 --> 00:11:10,296
all the way around to the thing that you started with.

202
00:11:10,296 --> 00:11:14,920
But that practice, that's what researchers do.

203
00:11:14,920 --> 00:11:17,782
And that's how they learn as much as possible

204
00:11:17,782 --> 00:11:19,983
about their topic areas, is they just

205
00:11:19,983 --> 00:11:23,466
go find the resources that their resources used.

206
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:27,689
So that's a great way to build content, citations, examples,

207
00:11:27,689 --> 00:11:28,550
and things like that.

208
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:32,920
And then the more you do that and the more you share it,

209
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,542
the more that everybody else in this room, for example,

210
00:11:36,542 --> 00:11:41,045
will be able to, everybody else will be able to pull

211
00:11:41,045 --> 00:11:44,246
from the knowledge base you've created.

212
00:11:44,246 --> 00:11:45,587
Which brings us to sharing.

213
00:11:45,587 --> 00:11:48,028
Now sharing is tricky in the game industry.

214
00:11:48,028 --> 00:11:50,130
We have these things called NDAs.

215
00:11:50,877 --> 00:11:53,198
And when we were prepping for this talk,

216
00:11:53,198 --> 00:11:57,299
Joel had a great quote about NDA and sharing in level design.

217
00:11:57,299 --> 00:11:59,400
And I wanted to share it with you,

218
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,480
because it's not under NDA.

219
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:03,961
I think there's a self-policing culture of fear

220
00:12:03,961 --> 00:12:05,502
that prevents us from sharing.

221
00:12:05,502 --> 00:12:08,202
It's useful to generally chip away at this culture.

222
00:12:08,202 --> 00:12:11,744
So here's my attempt at chipping away at this culture.

223
00:12:11,744 --> 00:12:14,504
I talk a lot about thinking like an architect

224
00:12:14,504 --> 00:12:15,925
and seeing like an architect.

225
00:12:15,925 --> 00:12:19,066
Today I want to talk to you about talking like an architect.

226
00:12:19,806 --> 00:12:26,278
So this is an image from a book called Pattern Language by Christopher Alexander.

227
00:12:26,278 --> 00:12:30,446
It's a book of design principles.

228
00:12:30,911 --> 00:12:36,696
And in it, he talks about specific buildings as examples of these principles, but he starts

229
00:12:36,696 --> 00:12:37,757
with the principle.

230
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:44,042
He starts talking about these things like, you know, the shapes of space or humans going

231
00:12:44,042 --> 00:12:47,985
from dark to light, lighting conditions, things like that.

232
00:12:47,985 --> 00:12:53,890
And he talks about them as laws of design and laws of human behavior in space.

233
00:12:54,390 --> 00:12:58,933
only after he's explained what those things are does he actually get into specific examples.

234
00:12:58,933 --> 00:13:05,338
And the idea would be, if you are working on something, and you are thinking about design

235
00:13:05,338 --> 00:13:11,382
concepts as you're working on it, don't start, don't lead with the, I'm working on this game

236
00:13:11,382 --> 00:13:17,025
called X and Y, and let me tell you about this concept. Start with the concept.

237
00:13:17,669 --> 00:13:23,537
And what's useful about this, so you can describe concepts in generally applicable ways, you

238
00:13:23,537 --> 00:13:25,440
create design theories this way.

239
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,809
And I like doing this especially when I am writing and using examples from published

240
00:13:31,809 --> 00:13:33,832
games, like published popular games.

241
00:13:34,433 --> 00:13:36,794
I always default to action-adventure games.

242
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:41,136
I'm a huge fan of Zeldas and Metroids and Hyper Light Drifters and Skyrim and things

243
00:13:41,136 --> 00:13:41,477
like that.

244
00:13:41,477 --> 00:13:45,439
So I'll always default to using that as an example, but then I have to stop myself and

245
00:13:45,439 --> 00:13:45,599
say,

246
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:46,319
I don't know.

247
00:13:46,319 --> 00:13:46,759
I just don't.

248
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:47,540
I just don't.

249
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:47,740
I don't.

250
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:48,280
I just don't.

251
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:48,980
I just don't.

252
00:13:50,001 --> 00:13:52,422
Can I get this to work in a racing game?

253
00:13:52,422 --> 00:13:54,283
Can I get this concept to...

254
00:13:54,283 --> 00:13:57,784
Can I think of where it could be applied somewhere like that?

255
00:13:57,784 --> 00:14:00,486
And if I can't, then I should go back and rework the concept.

256
00:14:00,486 --> 00:14:02,186
Same thing with technology.

257
00:14:02,186 --> 00:14:03,727
If I can't...

258
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,188
If I'm thinking about something in terms of Unreal

259
00:14:06,188 --> 00:14:08,449
and I can't think of it in terms of Unity,

260
00:14:08,449 --> 00:14:10,750
then it's only useful to the Unreal audience

261
00:14:10,750 --> 00:14:12,351
and therefore invalid.

262
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:16,253
Because you want to make things as useful to everybody

263
00:14:16,253 --> 00:14:17,853
who's a level designer as possible.

264
00:14:19,606 --> 00:14:24,228
So that's talking without identifying your game,

265
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:27,089
without speaking about your specific game.

266
00:14:27,089 --> 00:14:28,570
Another thing you can do is sketch ideas

267
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,510
without content that identifies your game.

268
00:14:30,510 --> 00:14:33,732
Again, I can take a concept like creating

269
00:14:33,732 --> 00:14:35,592
the feeling of curiosity in players

270
00:14:35,592 --> 00:14:39,114
with rhythmic elements and shaded lighting conditions,

271
00:14:39,114 --> 00:14:41,675
which this is a diagram of,

272
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:43,756
and I don't have to draw a specific game.

273
00:14:43,756 --> 00:14:45,996
I can just draw pillars and some light

274
00:14:45,996 --> 00:14:47,857
and a stick figure that's going, ooh.

275
00:14:49,027 --> 00:14:53,550
And if you can do that, you represent...

276
00:14:53,550 --> 00:14:55,632
People can fill in the gaps themselves,

277
00:14:55,632 --> 00:14:57,754
be like, oh, I've seen games that use that.

278
00:14:57,754 --> 00:15:00,536
You don't have to use screenshots from your game

279
00:15:00,536 --> 00:15:02,057
or even games in particular.

280
00:15:02,057 --> 00:15:04,920
This is also a way, when you're writing a book,

281
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,402
to not have to ask for permission to use screenshots.

282
00:15:09,819 --> 00:15:14,300
Find examples in release games. So again, use games that

283
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:20,842
have already come out, either yours or ones that you play. And this is also great because it helps build us a

284
00:15:20,842 --> 00:15:28,024
canon of levels for people to learn from and create as great works. Like, what's the falling water of level design?

285
00:15:28,824 --> 00:15:30,365
Maybe we should figure that out.

286
00:15:30,365 --> 00:15:32,986
That's an interesting question.

287
00:15:32,986 --> 00:15:40,291
And then if you are going to use a screenshot or some example, and again Joel contributed

288
00:15:40,291 --> 00:15:42,632
this one, use example props.

289
00:15:42,632 --> 00:15:49,756
Make just some blocks to use in 3D or use old props from old games that you've already

290
00:15:49,756 --> 00:15:54,318
published and that way you don't have to again use that NDA protected stuff.

291
00:15:55,450 --> 00:16:00,573
Long story short, more sharing equals design history equals more knowledge.

292
00:16:00,573 --> 00:16:07,076
I love this book cover because it illustrates this idea very succinctly.

293
00:16:07,076 --> 00:16:12,919
This Georgian-style building probably wouldn't exist if people didn't understand Greek architecture.

294
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,900
And if we just wiped all of the Greek temples off the map,

295
00:16:18,900 --> 00:16:22,801
then we wouldn't have all these architecture styles

296
00:16:22,801 --> 00:16:25,442
that were inspired by them.

297
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:27,203
Same thing with your levels.

298
00:16:27,203 --> 00:16:28,543
If we don't talk about your levels

299
00:16:28,543 --> 00:16:29,923
and we don't celebrate your levels,

300
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,384
which are great art themselves,

301
00:16:32,384 --> 00:16:35,545
then they're gone.

302
00:16:35,545 --> 00:16:36,965
So we should talk about them.

303
00:16:36,965 --> 00:16:41,306
So lastly, what have I personally learned

304
00:16:41,306 --> 00:16:42,827
by writing about level design?

305
00:16:44,155 --> 00:16:49,380
The first and perhaps most important is, who am I to write a book?

306
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,242
I do not work at a AAA studio.

307
00:16:51,242 --> 00:16:53,043
I've never worked at a AAA studio.

308
00:16:53,043 --> 00:16:56,426
I am not indie famous.

309
00:16:56,426 --> 00:16:59,729
But I am the person who chose to open a Word document one day.

310
00:17:00,372 --> 00:17:01,113
And that matters.

311
00:17:01,113 --> 00:17:03,676
So sometimes you're just the person

312
00:17:03,676 --> 00:17:06,059
who dares to take this task on.

313
00:17:06,059 --> 00:17:10,165
And I've found that people that I am fans of come up to me

314
00:17:10,165 --> 00:17:13,929
and now say, oh my gosh, I'm a huge fan of your book.

315
00:17:13,929 --> 00:17:16,573
And I'll be like, oh my god, you made that game I love.

316
00:17:16,573 --> 00:17:17,013
And.

317
00:17:17,534 --> 00:17:18,654
That's really cool.

318
00:17:18,654 --> 00:17:24,456
All the people that I thought should probably be doing this instead like my work now.

319
00:17:24,456 --> 00:17:28,637
So maybe not all, but some that I've talked to.

320
00:17:28,637 --> 00:17:30,438
And that's really cool.

321
00:17:30,438 --> 00:17:32,758
So don't be afraid to try.

322
00:17:32,758 --> 00:17:34,379
Never be afraid to start and try.

323
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:37,500
And that goes for anything in the game industry.

324
00:17:37,500 --> 00:17:41,361
Do the thing, and people will eventually recognize you for it.

325
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,502
I also learned the publishing process, which I'm not going to read this whole thing, because

326
00:17:44,502 --> 00:17:46,182
I only have a few minutes left.

327
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:46,422
But...

328
00:17:48,375 --> 00:17:52,837
In summary, you submit your idea to an editor who's in charge of finding new books.

329
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:55,477
They're called acquisitions editors.

330
00:17:55,477 --> 00:18:00,678
Then you work with them to develop an outline that provides something different from what's

331
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:01,939
already on the market.

332
00:18:01,939 --> 00:18:05,060
So again, that goes back to the idea of filling in knowledge gaps.

333
00:18:05,060 --> 00:18:08,060
If you are contributing something that's never been contributed before,

334
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:10,181
the publisher will get really excited.

335
00:18:10,181 --> 00:18:15,183
So then once you've established this and usually gone through a round of peer review,

336
00:18:15,183 --> 00:18:21,525
so submitting to people in the industry that look at your proposal and say, yeah, that's

337
00:18:21,525 --> 00:18:22,866
a thing that should exist.

338
00:18:23,686 --> 00:18:28,292
You write your manuscript, give it to the editors, and they help you arrange your content,

339
00:18:28,292 --> 00:18:33,519
check it for grammar, make it sound better than it did when it just came out of your

340
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:37,605
fingers when you were perhaps a little too tired to type.

341
00:18:37,605 --> 00:18:41,050
But it's put into a final layout, printed, and then book.

342
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:47,439
I also learned how to best choose the release method for content.

343
00:18:47,439 --> 00:18:53,843
I'm talking a lot about books and publishing, but I've talked with a lot of people that

344
00:18:53,843 --> 00:18:57,365
have said, no, I want my stuff to be available for free.

345
00:18:57,365 --> 00:19:03,809
I go with what I go with because as an academic, I get credit in my day job for publishing

346
00:19:03,809 --> 00:19:05,410
with presses.

347
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,451
That's just part of the academic thing.

348
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:13,195
if you are weighing which one to go with.

349
00:19:13,195 --> 00:19:14,015
Here's a breakdown.

350
00:19:14,015 --> 00:19:16,677
Publishers are great.

351
00:19:16,677 --> 00:19:19,239
They do a lot of things for you, but your work

352
00:19:19,239 --> 00:19:20,800
becomes part of their business model.

353
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:21,660
They sell it.

354
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,682
They may even own your manuscript.

355
00:19:23,682 --> 00:19:27,464
I've had friends who want to get their manuscript republished,

356
00:19:27,464 --> 00:19:28,845
but the publisher doesn't want to do it,

357
00:19:28,845 --> 00:19:30,926
so they had to buy their manuscript back.

358
00:19:30,926 --> 00:19:33,288
So be aware of that.

359
00:19:33,288 --> 00:19:37,911
It's really not that big a deal day to day, but be aware of it.

360
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:43,534
Putting it out on the internet for free lets you reach lots of people, regardless of their

361
00:19:43,534 --> 00:19:48,197
ability to pay for content, and that's really important.

362
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:53,081
Diversity and economic diversity is really important, and I really respect the people

363
00:19:53,081 --> 00:19:58,125
who do choose to put stuff out for free to help.

364
00:19:58,945 --> 00:20:01,869
people, to help content reach people.

365
00:20:01,869 --> 00:20:08,336
The downside of this, though, is that it lacks a system of checks and balances to help every

366
00:20:08,336 --> 00:20:13,902
bit of proving that you are the person who should be talking about this, to editing your

367
00:20:13,902 --> 00:20:17,726
content, making it sound good.

368
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:19,747
something you have to take on your own,

369
00:20:19,747 --> 00:20:21,488
and you also have to do your own marketing.

370
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:23,268
Publishers do marketing for you.

371
00:20:23,268 --> 00:20:25,669
So both have their ups and downs,

372
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:26,889
and those are things to think about.

373
00:20:26,889 --> 00:20:30,750
And then lastly, and another important thing,

374
00:20:30,750 --> 00:20:32,791
is making a famous game is not the only way

375
00:20:32,791 --> 00:20:34,811
to make a positive impact on the industry.

376
00:20:34,811 --> 00:20:39,192
It's worth saying that sharing content, teaching people,

377
00:20:39,192 --> 00:20:40,273
and helping.

378
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:44,020
create a system of theory and knowledge

379
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:45,263
that other people can pull from

380
00:20:45,263 --> 00:20:48,429
and hopefully make even better games and levels

381
00:20:48,429 --> 00:20:50,193
is a worthwhile pursuit.

382
00:20:50,193 --> 00:20:51,736
And I think we should celebrate it more.

383
00:20:53,294 --> 00:20:55,436
So I've learned a lot by sharing my work,

384
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:57,198
but I'm giving this talk because I

385
00:20:57,198 --> 00:21:00,341
don't think that I should or can do this alone.

386
00:21:00,341 --> 00:21:04,286
Again, I want this to be as varied and diverse

387
00:21:04,286 --> 00:21:08,090
as all those game design books that are up in the bookstore.

388
00:21:08,090 --> 00:21:10,413
And there are lots of experiences

389
00:21:10,413 --> 00:21:11,394
in game development.

390
00:21:11,394 --> 00:21:13,016
Mine are not the only ones out there.

391
00:21:13,676 --> 00:21:16,718
and they can all impact how we make game levels.

392
00:21:16,718 --> 00:21:18,379
So I'm issuing a call to action.

393
00:21:18,379 --> 00:21:22,642
Take what you're doing and use it

394
00:21:22,642 --> 00:21:24,964
to tell the world about level design.

395
00:21:24,964 --> 00:21:28,866
Help us build a library of level design knowledge

396
00:21:28,866 --> 00:21:32,449
and make it knowledge that can be shared by people,

397
00:21:32,449 --> 00:21:35,691
can be talked about and discussed.

398
00:21:37,202 --> 00:21:40,283
so that we can make better and more diverse game spaces

399
00:21:40,283 --> 00:21:42,023
that rival the most beautiful houses,

400
00:21:42,023 --> 00:21:45,484
most iconic skyscrapers, and the most sublime cathedrals.

401
00:21:45,484 --> 00:21:47,464
And I have a few minutes for questions,

402
00:21:47,464 --> 00:21:49,144
but thank you for coming to my talk.

403
00:21:49,144 --> 00:21:49,304
Thank you.

404
00:21:49,304 --> 00:21:59,226
Thanks.

405
00:21:59,226 --> 00:22:01,467
Thank you.

406
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:02,047
Questions?

407
00:22:02,047 --> 00:22:04,947
Yeah, there's two mics up here if anybody has a question.

408
00:22:10,987 --> 00:22:12,988
Going, going, alright.

409
00:22:17,868 --> 00:22:24,950
Hi, I'm currently a student at DigiPen in Seattle and I've been working a lot with a

410
00:22:24,950 --> 00:22:29,612
colleague of mine just trying to learn more about level design in a way that isn't really

411
00:22:29,612 --> 00:22:34,733
taught at our school. And we've had a really hard time as far as finding levels, like a

412
00:22:34,733 --> 00:22:39,935
collection of levels for any sort of concept. Is there some sort of database or like some

413
00:22:39,935 --> 00:22:42,936
sort of collection of, these are good examples of these kinds of levels.

414
00:22:43,188 --> 00:22:47,396
Yeah, so the question was, is there a database of levels

415
00:22:47,396 --> 00:22:48,438
to look at?

416
00:22:49,650 --> 00:22:51,172
Not that I'm aware of.

417
00:22:51,172 --> 00:22:54,174
We had an interesting conversation before this.

418
00:22:54,174 --> 00:22:58,558
There was a preview article posted about this workshop

419
00:22:58,558 --> 00:23:01,641
that one of the questions was similar to yours.

420
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:03,182
I would start there.

421
00:23:03,182 --> 00:23:05,404
There were some great citations,

422
00:23:05,404 --> 00:23:07,566
but that could be a project, actually.

423
00:23:07,566 --> 00:23:10,328
That sounds like a good idea, history of level design.

424
00:23:10,328 --> 00:23:11,409
We'll talk.

425
00:23:11,409 --> 00:23:13,351
Yeah, that'd be a good idea.

426
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:21,447
Hi, my name is Deepak. I teach design at Roblox, and a lot of them are user-generated content,

427
00:23:21,447 --> 00:23:26,413
so a lot of them don't have that background. I find this very fascinating. So besides level

428
00:23:26,413 --> 00:23:32,820
design, what else do you feel like a lot of designers aren't bringing in when they come

429
00:23:32,820 --> 00:23:33,721
into making games?

430
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:39,024
So what are designers not bringing in when they make games?

431
00:23:39,024 --> 00:23:43,168
I've talked a lot about art history in this,

432
00:23:43,168 --> 00:23:48,393
but a lot of with my expertise, it goes back to art history.

433
00:23:48,393 --> 00:23:52,016
And I do see that in game development.

434
00:23:52,016 --> 00:23:52,977
For example, you know...

435
00:23:54,694 --> 00:23:57,816
I'm making a Don Quixote card game right now.

436
00:23:57,816 --> 00:24:00,318
It's essentially an intellectual property

437
00:24:00,318 --> 00:24:01,399
that's just been sitting there,

438
00:24:01,399 --> 00:24:03,921
because it's a novel from 1605, right?

439
00:24:03,921 --> 00:24:07,523
And I know that because I read literature.

440
00:24:07,523 --> 00:24:10,025
And something like that surprises me you don't see more of,

441
00:24:10,025 --> 00:24:12,707
people just taking a great classic book

442
00:24:12,707 --> 00:24:14,248
and being like, let me make a game out of this,

443
00:24:14,248 --> 00:24:14,889
because I can.

444
00:24:14,889 --> 00:24:20,012
And then you're also working on a franchise,

445
00:24:20,012 --> 00:24:21,533
in that way.

446
00:24:21,533 --> 00:24:23,235
So, just...

447
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:28,359
Those cultural milestones beyond game development,

448
00:24:28,359 --> 00:24:32,563
I think, I'd like to see more of in the game industry.

449
00:24:32,563 --> 00:24:36,127
I listened to a podcast interviewing Tim Schafer,

450
00:24:36,127 --> 00:24:37,628
and he said one of the best things he ever did

451
00:24:37,628 --> 00:24:41,292
was take a folklore class in college.

452
00:24:41,292 --> 00:24:44,355
And that rich outer life helped him

453
00:24:44,615 --> 00:24:47,115
go back to games and then make things like Grim Fandango,

454
00:24:47,115 --> 00:24:48,936
which is based on Mexican folklore.

455
00:24:48,936 --> 00:24:53,237
So any, like I said, any interest that you have,

456
00:24:53,237 --> 00:24:55,057
if you can find a way to get it to work

457
00:24:55,057 --> 00:24:58,078
with game development,

458
00:24:58,078 --> 00:25:01,239
I would absolutely say do more of it.

459
00:25:01,239 --> 00:25:01,699
Yeah.

460
00:25:01,699 --> 00:25:04,320
I guess since no one else is asking,

461
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:08,121
what's your biggest gripe with level design today?

462
00:25:08,121 --> 00:25:12,462
My biggest gripe with level design today, wow.

463
00:25:17,772 --> 00:25:21,114
I guess like over linearity would be my gripe.

464
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:25,096
And there are games where it's like, yes, this should be linear.

465
00:25:25,096 --> 00:25:27,317
But you know, I, I love Doom 2016.

466
00:25:27,317 --> 00:25:31,960
And I love that I was playing a first person shooter that I can just run around in a big

467
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:37,603
loop and have something chase me and then turn around and shoot at it and then run away

468
00:25:37,603 --> 00:25:38,363
in another loop.

469
00:25:38,823 --> 00:25:41,164
And that was really cool.

470
00:25:41,164 --> 00:25:43,045
I felt like I played so many games

471
00:25:43,045 --> 00:25:47,286
that were just long hallways, and then longer hallways.

472
00:25:47,286 --> 00:25:50,186
And I don't know, that felt really good

473
00:25:50,186 --> 00:25:54,307
to see a level that was laid out like that again

474
00:25:54,307 --> 00:25:57,848
after not seeing it since really the 90s.

475
00:25:57,848 --> 00:25:58,208
So yeah.

476
00:26:00,378 --> 00:26:04,420
Hi, I'm an autodidact, and I end up reading a lot of books.

477
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:06,521
I love that little slide show.

478
00:26:06,521 --> 00:26:09,343
I was like, yes, got that one, got that one, got that one.

479
00:26:09,343 --> 00:26:10,643
But one thing I really, really love

480
00:26:10,643 --> 00:26:12,404
is being able to have situations like this where

481
00:26:12,404 --> 00:26:16,046
we get to talk to a teacher and converse a little bit more.

482
00:26:16,046 --> 00:26:20,508
So for Lowell designers, what is a introductory course,

483
00:26:20,508 --> 00:26:22,689
or what is a kind of course that we

484
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:25,550
could find at a local college that you would suggest

485
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:27,591
relating to architecture and thinking more

486
00:26:27,591 --> 00:26:28,251
in this direction?

487
00:26:29,012 --> 00:26:31,653
Ooh, that's a really good question.

488
00:26:31,653 --> 00:26:36,395
So courses that you can find that I would recommend

489
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:37,895
for level designers.

490
00:26:37,895 --> 00:26:40,356
If you took an architectural theory course,

491
00:26:40,356 --> 00:26:44,658
and it is one where they talk about not just identifying

492
00:26:44,658 --> 00:26:47,219
the buildings and using them as references,

493
00:26:47,219 --> 00:26:49,260
because a lot of people think architecture and game design,

494
00:26:49,260 --> 00:26:51,881
they think about environment art and making things

495
00:26:51,881 --> 00:26:54,122
look like classic architecture.

496
00:26:54,122 --> 00:26:57,203
But if they're talking about architectural design concepts

497
00:26:57,203 --> 00:26:57,923
in that course.

498
00:26:58,523 --> 00:27:00,545
which a lot of things will do.

499
00:27:00,545 --> 00:27:03,348
They talk about why the building was important.

500
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:05,911
It's usually something experiential.

501
00:27:05,911 --> 00:27:09,314
Then that would be a really good point.

502
00:27:09,314 --> 00:27:11,676
If you're not thinking of taking a course

503
00:27:11,676 --> 00:27:14,459
or can't take a course, then I really

504
00:27:14,459 --> 00:27:19,224
like the book Chambers for a Memory Palace by.

505
00:27:20,767 --> 00:27:25,534
Linden and Moore, L-Y-N-D-O-N-N-M-O-O-R-E.

506
00:27:25,534 --> 00:27:29,399
And that is a, it's basically two old architects.

507
00:27:30,497 --> 00:27:34,398
comparing notes about experiences of buildings they saw.

508
00:27:34,398 --> 00:27:37,039
And it's really cool, and it's funny

509
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:38,820
because they actually take a little jab

510
00:27:38,820 --> 00:27:40,620
at video games in the beginning,

511
00:27:40,620 --> 00:27:41,960
and I'm like, I'm citing it.

512
00:27:41,960 --> 00:27:46,462
Like, you're a great book for level designers, so ha.

513
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:50,163
And yeah, so that's a book that I tell a lot of people.

514
00:27:50,163 --> 00:27:52,984
It's actually a pretty good read,

515
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:55,304
so if you're not able to take class, maybe buy that book.

516
00:27:55,304 --> 00:27:56,585
Yeah.

517
00:28:01,457 --> 00:28:02,449
So, yeah.

518
00:28:02,449 --> 00:28:03,199
Thank you.

00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:10,512
I don't know, maybe I'll mention a few podcasts I like too.

520
00:28:10,512 --> 00:28:15,535
I've listened to a lot of Checkpoints, they do cool things with design concepts.

521
00:28:15,535 --> 00:28:22,559
Level Design Lobby has been really helpful and I listen a lot to Retro Knots and I know

522
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:26,041
they've been around forever but they've been doing a series on Metroidvania design which

523
00:28:26,041 --> 00:28:27,061
has been fantastic.

524
00:28:27,061 --> 00:28:32,204
So, again, those are free and if you go listen to those, there's some good stuff there.

525
00:28:32,204 --> 00:28:32,264
So...

526
00:28:34,105 --> 00:28:41,232
If that's it, then be sure to come back after the break for the holy grail of multiplayer

527
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:48,919
level design, maps for casual and competitive play, which will be really cool.

528
00:28:48,919 --> 00:28:52,623
So thank you for coming out and listening to the talk.
