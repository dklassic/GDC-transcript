1
00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:09,309
Before I kick off the talk, I would just like to ask the question,

2
00:00:09,309 --> 00:00:10,690
why I even talk about this topic,

3
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:12,051
why I think it's worth your time,

4
00:00:12,051 --> 00:00:14,292
and that comes from my day-to-day business.

5
00:00:14,292 --> 00:00:17,194
I do run a PR marketing agency for games,

6
00:00:17,194 --> 00:00:20,616
and we work with clients and studios from all over the world

7
00:00:20,616 --> 00:00:23,377
and with really different experience levels.

8
00:00:23,377 --> 00:00:25,599
And usually when they come to us,

9
00:00:25,599 --> 00:00:28,080
they have quite good ideas of certain things.

10
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:29,441
They know that the trailer is important.

11
00:00:29,441 --> 00:00:31,022
They know a store page is important.

12
00:00:31,022 --> 00:00:32,963
They know they're going to need a press kit.

13
00:00:32,963 --> 00:00:33,403
But when...

14
00:00:34,432 --> 00:00:37,394
we go into more details and say we need to work on GIFs,

15
00:00:37,394 --> 00:00:39,375
we need to have a good PR plan about GIFs,

16
00:00:39,375 --> 00:00:40,595
what do you think about that?

17
00:00:40,595 --> 00:00:42,857
They often look a bit like that.

18
00:00:42,857 --> 00:00:45,878
Because I do think GIFs still have a bit of a reputation

19
00:00:45,878 --> 00:00:48,579
that they're just memes, and there's a lot about jokes,

20
00:00:48,579 --> 00:00:51,081
and it's basically just something for babies.

21
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:52,221
And some of it is true,

22
00:00:52,221 --> 00:00:53,682
that's definitely something GIFs can be,

23
00:00:53,682 --> 00:00:55,783
but that's not everything GIFs are.

24
00:00:56,472 --> 00:00:57,654
There's way more you can do with it.

25
00:00:57,654 --> 00:01:00,617
So here's just a couple of scenes of different games

26
00:01:00,617 --> 00:01:04,021
that we either worked with or I really like in GIF form.

27
00:01:04,021 --> 00:01:06,184
And I think what you can see there in a couple of seconds

28
00:01:06,184 --> 00:01:06,464
is that.

29
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:11,979
Those are really short clips, but already you can probably see which games you like of those,

30
00:01:11,979 --> 00:01:16,324
which you would want to find out more, which one you maybe don't want to find out more.

31
00:01:16,324 --> 00:01:19,767
But we just watched eight games looping through one and a half times,

32
00:01:19,767 --> 00:01:22,790
and you probably already have quite good connection to some of them.

33
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:24,833
So I think that's the real power of GIFs.

34
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:26,855
That's really what drives the format.

35
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:31,362
that you get so much information across really, really quickly.

36
00:01:31,362 --> 00:01:34,164
And that's really helpful in a lot of channels.

37
00:01:34,164 --> 00:01:36,587
For example, it's not uncommon for a tweet

38
00:01:36,587 --> 00:01:37,888
with a nice GIF to do really well,

39
00:01:37,888 --> 00:01:39,509
get thousands of retweets.

40
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:40,850
We're going to talk about Imgur today.

41
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:43,293
If you reach the front page, you can get hundreds of thousands

42
00:01:43,293 --> 00:01:44,213
of views.

43
00:01:44,213 --> 00:01:45,995
If you happen to land on the Reddit front page,

44
00:01:45,995 --> 00:01:47,256
you can get millions of views.

45
00:01:47,997 --> 00:01:53,458
We do deal a lot with PR, as a PR with journalists and influencers,

46
00:01:53,458 --> 00:01:57,300
and our success rate of getting pitches through with them

47
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:00,121
while having a nice gift is way higher than without them.

48
00:02:00,121 --> 00:02:02,442
And you can also give on storefronts,

49
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:04,822
or Steam for example, or on Kickstarter,

50
00:02:04,822 --> 00:02:08,043
and that of course can mean more money, more conversion.

51
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:14,023
And I think it's also at the moment that gifs are more relevant than they used to be.

52
00:02:14,023 --> 00:02:15,904
There's a couple of factors for that.

53
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:17,805
One is that there are just way more games than there used to be.

54
00:02:17,805 --> 00:02:20,586
There's always more games coming out and more and more and more.

55
00:02:20,586 --> 00:02:22,727
So the attention span, I think, of a lot of parties,

56
00:02:22,727 --> 00:02:26,349
be it publishers, platform holders, players, press, and so on,

57
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:28,850
their attention spans are just really short.

58
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:32,072
So often you just have a couple of seconds to really convince them about your game

59
00:02:32,072 --> 00:02:33,713
or at least get them interested to find out more.

60
00:02:34,778 --> 00:02:38,642
And if you watch a couple of other talks from this year's GDC and read current blog posts,

61
00:02:38,642 --> 00:02:44,628
I'm sure you're going to notice that something we call the grind is more important than ever.

62
00:02:45,078 --> 00:02:51,000
it seems that for a lot of games, the most secure way to have a successful launch and

63
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:56,221
successful phase is to build your own community. And to build a community, you need to have a

64
00:02:56,221 --> 00:03:00,262
constant output and constantly get new people in from new channels. You constantly need to break

65
00:03:00,262 --> 00:03:04,442
out of your little bubble and reach more people. And that's what we call the grind. And GIFs are

66
00:03:04,442 --> 00:03:08,303
really useful for that because if you work for trailers, for example, they're really expensive to

67
00:03:08,303 --> 00:03:08,623
make.

68
00:03:09,264 --> 00:03:10,865
They did a lot of work, a lot of effort.

69
00:03:10,865 --> 00:03:13,186
If they don't work out, that's a big problem.

70
00:03:13,186 --> 00:03:15,788
If you make a couple of GIFs and one or two don't work out,

71
00:03:15,788 --> 00:03:16,269
that's fine.

72
00:03:16,269 --> 00:03:19,411
So they're just easier to produce,

73
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:21,493
and this is helpful in the current environment.

74
00:03:21,493 --> 00:03:23,874
And I think that the whole philosophy of that

75
00:03:23,874 --> 00:03:27,077
the grind is really important is also supported by Steam,

76
00:03:27,077 --> 00:03:30,099
because they make wish lists very important at the moment.

77
00:03:30,099 --> 00:03:31,760
So really, working a couple of months

78
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,041
hard to break out of your bubble,

79
00:03:33,041 --> 00:03:34,722
to reach a lot of people, get a lot of wish lists,

80
00:03:34,722 --> 00:03:36,904
is just really important right now.

81
00:03:38,563 --> 00:03:40,910
So what we want to talk about today is three topics.

82
00:03:40,910 --> 00:03:43,437
We want to talk what a good GIF looks like,

83
00:03:43,437 --> 00:03:46,245
how to make a good GIF, and where to post it.

84
00:03:47,591 --> 00:03:50,913
Before we do that, we have to get a bit of an awkward topic out of the way.

85
00:03:50,913 --> 00:03:52,474
That is how to really pronounce GIF.

86
00:03:52,474 --> 00:03:54,475
Because some people say GIF and some say GIF.

87
00:03:54,475 --> 00:03:58,738
So I really wanted to know how to really pronounce GIF, so I went on howtoreallypronouncegif.com.

88
00:03:58,738 --> 00:04:02,860
And they say you say GIF, so like GIF but without the T. So I'm going to say GIF.

89
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:08,004
And it looks like there's a lot of people that feel really strongly about this.

90
00:04:08,004 --> 00:04:10,545
So strongly that you can buy T-shirts and stickers.

91
00:04:10,545 --> 00:04:12,006
I don't feel strongly about this.

92
00:04:12,006 --> 00:04:14,307
If you want to say GIF, that's totally fine by me.

93
00:04:14,307 --> 00:04:15,888
But I'm going to go with GIF for today.

94
00:04:17,648 --> 00:04:20,209
And what was the another thing?

95
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,090
It's more like a definition for the talk today.

96
00:04:23,090 --> 00:04:25,611
I see GIF more of a philosophy than a file format.

97
00:04:25,611 --> 00:04:29,412
And what I mean by that is obviously GIF is a file format,

98
00:04:29,412 --> 00:04:31,313
but sometimes you just take a short video

99
00:04:31,313 --> 00:04:32,974
and post that on Twitter.

100
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:36,935
Sometimes you use Giphy, sometimes you use some HTML format.

101
00:04:36,935 --> 00:04:38,115
And for me, that all counts as GIF.

102
00:04:38,115 --> 00:04:40,916
So when I say GIF today, I just mean like a short video clip

103
00:04:40,916 --> 00:04:42,157
of your game that you post somewhere.

104
00:04:43,768 --> 00:04:48,191
And before we start off, a few things that might be helpful to know about me.

105
00:04:48,191 --> 00:04:49,472
My name is Thomas Reisennecker.

106
00:04:49,472 --> 00:04:52,495
I really like having my name in Flamethon.

107
00:04:52,495 --> 00:04:55,557
I also founded a PR agency in Brighton, UK.

108
00:04:55,557 --> 00:05:00,801
I've worked in PR for years, worked on over 70 titles in the beginning,

109
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,423
quite big ones like League of Legends and Paladins.

110
00:05:03,423 --> 00:05:08,347
And now we really focus on, with their own agency, focus on premium indie games

111
00:05:08,347 --> 00:05:11,950
like Orwell, Omno, Heaven's Vault, Burying My Love, that kind of game.

112
00:05:13,339 --> 00:05:15,700
Which I think gets me in a quite good position

113
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:19,221
to talk about a topic like that, because we deal with a really

114
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:20,741
big quantity of games.

115
00:05:20,741 --> 00:05:23,982
And obviously, if you work on so many different projects,

116
00:05:23,982 --> 00:05:25,382
you also get a lot of different data

117
00:05:25,382 --> 00:05:28,083
and see how different campaigns work out.

118
00:05:28,083 --> 00:05:30,144
And working with those small indies,

119
00:05:30,144 --> 00:05:33,405
they really work on a budget often that's very tight.

120
00:05:33,405 --> 00:05:37,946
So they really depend on really efficient communication

121
00:05:37,946 --> 00:05:38,126
methods.

122
00:05:38,126 --> 00:05:40,287
So what does a good GIF look like?

123
00:05:41,892 --> 00:05:43,854
If you just want to know what a GIF needs to look like,

124
00:05:43,854 --> 00:05:45,675
I got it on the front page of Reddit.

125
00:05:45,675 --> 00:05:47,597
If I would know that, I would not be standing here.

126
00:05:47,597 --> 00:05:49,759
I would be on an island having a cocktail.

127
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,022
It's really hard to figure out what really connects in a GIF.

128
00:05:53,022 --> 00:05:54,724
I've thought about it a lot.

129
00:05:54,724 --> 00:05:58,307
There's not one universal template you can take.

130
00:05:58,307 --> 00:05:59,789
I think it really boils down to figure out

131
00:05:59,789 --> 00:06:02,251
what the core of the game is and then

132
00:06:02,251 --> 00:06:04,213
test a lot of different things to see what resonates.

133
00:06:04,213 --> 00:06:05,614
I think that's a really important part.

134
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:09,464
So while we can't put up a formula how you make the perfect GIF,

135
00:06:09,464 --> 00:06:12,447
we can go through different GIFs that hopefully inspire you

136
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,770
and show you different categories you can go down and experiment.

137
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,312
But it really comes down per game,

138
00:06:18,312 --> 00:06:20,934
what is the ideal GIF for what it is, I think.

139
00:06:20,934 --> 00:06:24,377
So GIFs can be really good to use for gameplay GIFs.

140
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:27,099
This is the most simple form of a GIF, I think.

141
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:29,841
It's just recording gameplay footage.

142
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,563
And it can be really useful, for example,

143
00:06:31,563 --> 00:06:33,545
to show really complex gameplay mechanics.

144
00:06:33,545 --> 00:06:34,686
That's a game called Eastshade.

145
00:06:35,474 --> 00:06:36,255
It looks really beautiful.

146
00:06:36,255 --> 00:06:38,556
You walk around, you take pictures of the landscape

147
00:06:38,556 --> 00:06:40,437
and they're transported into paintings.

148
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,038
And if you describe it in a sentence,

149
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:43,239
that probably sounds a bit boring,

150
00:06:43,239 --> 00:06:44,900
but if you see it like that, it's really great.

151
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:45,400
So within one second,

152
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,962
you can really see how that game works.

153
00:06:48,962 --> 00:06:51,144
Another way, a certain type of game

154
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:52,544
that just works good in GIFs,

155
00:06:52,544 --> 00:06:54,486
if a game just looks really cool,

156
00:06:54,486 --> 00:06:56,647
this is my friend Pedro that works excellent.

157
00:06:56,647 --> 00:06:59,068
They have a really big social following.

158
00:06:59,068 --> 00:07:01,310
It's definitely also made to look cool in GIFs.

159
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:05,072
And another way to work with GIFs,

160
00:07:05,434 --> 00:07:09,201
with the format and take the most out of it is, I think, funny games work quite well.

161
00:07:09,201 --> 00:07:12,328
If you have a narrative game, if you want to have a certain scene, it can really help to

162
00:07:12,328 --> 00:07:16,957
just have one or two lines and a punchline. It's really good to get that across.

163
00:07:19,045 --> 00:07:22,008
There's of course bug gifs, I'm sure you've heard of them, I'm sure you've seen them.

164
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:25,650
There's a game called Water Golf and while they just look funny, they really can go big.

165
00:07:25,650 --> 00:07:30,054
You see some numbers here, here's another one from a game called Overland

166
00:07:30,054 --> 00:07:36,058
and all that happened there is the dog got really big and that got a thousand retweets.

167
00:07:36,058 --> 00:07:40,041
And there's no formula or like no preset how you can create funny bug gifs.

168
00:07:40,041 --> 00:07:42,023
I think the lesson to learn there is...

169
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,803
whoever works on the game and can encounter bugs,

170
00:07:45,803 --> 00:07:47,684
I think they should be equipped with the program

171
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,086
and the programs and the knowledge how to record GIFs.

172
00:07:50,086 --> 00:07:51,907
Because when it happens,

173
00:07:51,907 --> 00:07:53,649
that just takes a couple of seconds to record

174
00:07:53,649 --> 00:07:55,330
and they can really give you a big PR boost.

175
00:07:55,330 --> 00:07:57,572
It's really a shame to not have just that setup

176
00:07:57,572 --> 00:07:58,372
to record those GIFs.

177
00:07:58,372 --> 00:08:00,954
There's of course also joke GIFs.

178
00:08:00,954 --> 00:08:04,057
Here's a really good one, Sony Santa Monica.

179
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:06,118
They were really great with God of War GIFs.

180
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:08,912
And there's also event-related gifts.

181
00:08:08,912 --> 00:08:11,415
Here's one for Valentine's Day.

182
00:08:11,415 --> 00:08:12,616
And I think those are really funny.

183
00:08:12,616 --> 00:08:15,199
Those are great to entertain your community.

184
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:16,400
The only thing that's important there

185
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,802
is that people need to know what your game is already

186
00:08:18,802 --> 00:08:19,863
so those gifts work.

187
00:08:19,863 --> 00:08:22,606
So I would always say those are more important for

188
00:08:22,606 --> 00:08:26,210
more established brands than completely new games.

189
00:08:26,210 --> 00:08:28,212
Another gift category that I think is often

190
00:08:28,212 --> 00:08:30,114
overlooked is asset gifts.

191
00:08:30,669 --> 00:08:33,211
That just means using assets like a little banner

192
00:08:33,211 --> 00:08:34,432
on a Kickstarter page,

193
00:08:34,432 --> 00:08:37,495
little game description banners on a Steam page,

194
00:08:37,495 --> 00:08:38,996
like you see on the left or on the right,

195
00:08:38,996 --> 00:08:42,540
just showing more or less a menu, a bit in motion.

196
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:44,842
It can add a lot to just have the moving elements

197
00:08:44,842 --> 00:08:48,104
that makes it look way less boring.

198
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:51,548
So I think that's a really great way to also use a GIF format.

199
00:08:51,548 --> 00:08:55,251
Then there's something called main GIFs,

200
00:08:55,251 --> 00:08:58,173
and that's probably one of the most important slides of the talk.

201
00:09:01,365 --> 00:09:06,369
I highly recommend making a main GIF for every game you work on.

202
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:09,892
And what we see, what a main GIF is, what my definition of that is,

203
00:09:09,892 --> 00:09:11,233
it's just, it's a mini trailer.

204
00:09:11,233 --> 00:09:13,555
And we use that in loads of different ways.

205
00:09:13,555 --> 00:09:17,238
We use it to pitch to investors, to publishers, again to press,

206
00:09:17,238 --> 00:09:19,860
we show it to players for really important news.

207
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,822
That main trailer, that main GIF, is like a little trailer

208
00:09:22,822 --> 00:09:24,964
that shows off the most important aspects of your game.

209
00:09:25,952 --> 00:09:28,153
really have a good think what you want to show with the game.

210
00:09:28,153 --> 00:09:30,914
On the top left, we see, for example, Omno.

211
00:09:30,914 --> 00:09:32,695
And for that game, it was really important

212
00:09:32,695 --> 00:09:34,956
to show off the animation nicely.

213
00:09:34,956 --> 00:09:36,597
That's why it has quite high frame rate

214
00:09:36,597 --> 00:09:39,539
and to show the different environments.

215
00:09:39,539 --> 00:09:41,300
Below, we see a game called Hamsterdam.

216
00:09:41,300 --> 00:09:43,861
And for that game, the goal was clearly

217
00:09:43,861 --> 00:09:45,782
to show off the cute protagonist,

218
00:09:45,782 --> 00:09:47,643
but then to show a lot of gameplay variety.

219
00:09:47,643 --> 00:09:50,565
So you have a lot of really short shots,

220
00:09:50,565 --> 00:09:52,726
but you just see there's loads of different stuff in the games.

221
00:09:53,487 --> 00:09:54,848
And those are quite visual games.

222
00:09:54,848 --> 00:09:56,989
So those main GIFs are easier to make.

223
00:09:56,989 --> 00:10:00,451
But then let's have a look at a game that is maybe less visual.

224
00:10:00,451 --> 00:10:02,833
It's called Heaven's Vault. It's an adventure game.

225
00:10:02,833 --> 00:10:04,373
It looks nice, but there's no explosions in it.

226
00:10:04,373 --> 00:10:07,695
There's a lot of walking, a lot of reading.

227
00:10:07,695 --> 00:10:09,696
And what we made here is that we, A,

228
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:13,559
want to show a big variety in scenarios and sceneries.

229
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:16,200
That's why we have a lot of different scenes.

230
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:19,462
But the other thing we want to get across

231
00:10:20,312 --> 00:10:23,257
is that the game is developed from the developers of 80 Days,

232
00:10:23,257 --> 00:10:24,638
which was a very successful game.

233
00:10:24,638 --> 00:10:27,202
So that's a big plus for the title.

234
00:10:27,202 --> 00:10:29,385
And also it has a really interesting gameplay mechanic

235
00:10:29,385 --> 00:10:32,049
where you decipher, where you translate a whole language.

236
00:10:32,915 --> 00:10:34,636
And that's something that's really complicated

237
00:10:34,636 --> 00:10:37,699
to show in detail, but we can spell it out in a sentence

238
00:10:37,699 --> 00:10:39,000
and hint at it.

239
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,982
So the goal here really is not that people fully

240
00:10:40,982 --> 00:10:42,264
understand how the mechanic works,

241
00:10:42,264 --> 00:10:43,885
but how to get the top level pitch,

242
00:10:43,885 --> 00:10:46,528
like the one line what's really important about this game.

243
00:10:46,528 --> 00:10:47,528
So within a couple of seconds, you

244
00:10:47,528 --> 00:10:50,271
have that tiny trailer that explains a really complex game.

245
00:10:50,271 --> 00:10:53,474
Similar here for a game called Gladiobots,

246
00:10:53,474 --> 00:10:56,116
which was a really big challenge to get that GIF nice,

247
00:10:56,116 --> 00:10:58,799
because in the game, you have an AI editor.

248
00:10:59,487 --> 00:11:01,448
where you program an AI for your robot,

249
00:11:01,448 --> 00:11:03,429
and then you press play and your robot's fighting the arena.

250
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,170
So that means half of the game is a menu.

251
00:11:06,170 --> 00:11:07,391
It's just an AI editor.

252
00:11:07,391 --> 00:11:11,133
So that's obviously visually not the most attractive thing.

253
00:11:11,133 --> 00:11:14,175
So here it was really helpful to work with text in between,

254
00:11:14,175 --> 00:11:16,296
really explain how the game works,

255
00:11:16,296 --> 00:11:19,758
have that split screen in the beginning.

256
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:23,660
And again, imagine getting that game described in text form

257
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:24,541
versus that little GIF.

258
00:11:24,541 --> 00:11:26,022
I think it makes a really big difference

259
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,223
to get across the core of what's important about this game.

260
00:11:30,070 --> 00:11:33,994
So what makes a good GIF? I think there are a couple of core rules that I try to follow.

261
00:11:33,994 --> 00:11:37,437
One is definitely it has to be eye-catching.

262
00:11:37,437 --> 00:11:40,139
Don't start with like a long black screen. Just like go right in.

263
00:11:40,139 --> 00:11:43,942
Have something, have your best scene in the beginning because a lot of people are just going to scroll through it.

264
00:11:43,942 --> 00:11:46,124
And if it doesn't have anything cool in the first second, that's about it.

265
00:11:46,124 --> 00:11:50,688
Always assume that people don't know what your game is.

266
00:11:50,688 --> 00:11:54,491
Even if you've already had a couple of big tweets, there's always new people seeing your stuff.

267
00:11:54,491 --> 00:11:56,553
I think a good GIF has to work for newcomers as well.

268
00:11:57,880 --> 00:12:00,581
It doesn't need to be complete, as we saw with Heaven's Fault.

269
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:03,462
It just needs to be enough that players understand

270
00:12:03,462 --> 00:12:04,963
what the core premise of the game is.

271
00:12:04,963 --> 00:12:08,644
And really important for all the social media things,

272
00:12:08,644 --> 00:12:11,845
of course, is that people love that stuff versus just liking

273
00:12:11,845 --> 00:12:11,925
it.

274
00:12:11,925 --> 00:12:14,806
So if you can pick between making one really, really

275
00:12:14,806 --> 00:12:16,907
cool gif or 10 to 20 average gifs,

276
00:12:16,907 --> 00:12:19,448
always go for the one that people love.

277
00:12:19,448 --> 00:12:21,008
That has the potential to be shared.

278
00:12:21,008 --> 00:12:22,869
On social media stuff that is just OK

279
00:12:22,869 --> 00:12:24,490
is just not quite worth it.

280
00:12:27,197 --> 00:12:28,438
So, how do we make pretty GIFs?

281
00:12:28,438 --> 00:12:31,119
That's actually easier than I think

282
00:12:31,119 --> 00:12:33,181
that a lot of people would assume.

283
00:12:33,181 --> 00:12:35,682
Step number one, we wanna record a GIF.

284
00:12:35,682 --> 00:12:37,403
The quick and easy way to do that

285
00:12:37,403 --> 00:12:39,464
is with an on-screen recording tool.

286
00:12:39,464 --> 00:12:41,485
It's a little program, for example,

287
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:44,887
like GIFCam, Screen2GIF, or for Mac users, Lightscap.

288
00:12:45,819 --> 00:12:49,561
And those are all free and basically they just give you like a little window on screen

289
00:12:49,561 --> 00:12:53,483
and then you can record whatever is under that window and then you have a GIF.

290
00:12:53,483 --> 00:12:54,263
And that's it.

291
00:12:54,263 --> 00:12:58,305
So if you want to make a bug GIF that takes a couple of seconds, it's really great.

292
00:12:58,305 --> 00:13:05,889
There's also programs like OBS, Fraps or QuickTime where you can record video footage of those

293
00:13:05,889 --> 00:13:09,091
at that window and that's maybe more important if you want to have a really sophisticated

294
00:13:09,091 --> 00:13:10,432
GIF and want to edit it later.

295
00:13:11,810 --> 00:13:14,491
And the really bare bones thing to get a GIF

296
00:13:14,491 --> 00:13:17,072
is if you have a YouTube video or a YouTube trailer,

297
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:19,113
and you just go to giphy.com, and you put it in there,

298
00:13:19,113 --> 00:13:23,034
and you literally set down the duration and the start time,

299
00:13:23,034 --> 00:13:24,055
and then you have a GIF.

300
00:13:24,055 --> 00:13:27,236
Like that's from the Untitled Goose Game.

301
00:13:27,236 --> 00:13:29,577
I just made that yesterday.

302
00:13:29,577 --> 00:13:31,378
That took like 20 minutes to do.

303
00:13:31,378 --> 00:13:32,398
20 seconds, sorry.

304
00:13:32,398 --> 00:13:34,979
So it's extremely easy to, if you already

305
00:13:34,979 --> 00:13:37,540
have a YouTube link with Giphy, to just make one small GIF.

306
00:13:38,962 --> 00:13:44,867
Pros, if you want to make a really, really quality GIF or a quite challenging one because

307
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:49,191
you maybe need to find a certain file size, you're going to have to cut it in a video

308
00:13:49,191 --> 00:13:49,751
editor.

309
00:13:49,751 --> 00:13:52,374
There's loads of different video editors.

310
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:55,356
Usually for the purpose of a GIF, it doesn't really matter which one you use as long as

311
00:13:55,356 --> 00:13:57,278
you're comfortable with it.

312
00:13:57,278 --> 00:14:00,982
If you want to go mega hardcore, Photoshop can also edit frame by frame.

313
00:14:02,941 --> 00:14:04,681
Next up is just some editing tips.

314
00:14:04,681 --> 00:14:06,222
Those are not very scientific,

315
00:14:06,222 --> 00:14:08,902
but I've been just making hundreds of GIFs over the years,

316
00:14:08,902 --> 00:14:11,222
so this is like my top tip collection

317
00:14:11,222 --> 00:14:13,143
of what I do when I edit them.

318
00:14:13,143 --> 00:14:15,063
I really don't like having watermarks on GIFs,

319
00:14:15,063 --> 00:14:16,983
like little logos just in the corner,

320
00:14:16,983 --> 00:14:18,264
because they often look a bit markety,

321
00:14:18,264 --> 00:14:19,144
and it really doesn't help

322
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,784
for a lot of social media stuff and pitching.

323
00:14:21,784 --> 00:14:24,305
If you have a lot of really short scenes,

324
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,205
which happens in GIFs,

325
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:27,445
I try to leave them at least on for one second,

326
00:14:27,445 --> 00:14:29,205
because I think everything below that

327
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:30,526
is really hard for the eye

328
00:14:30,526 --> 00:14:32,286
to just get what's going on in the screen.

329
00:14:33,583 --> 00:14:37,206
I really avoid having gameplay and text at the same time.

330
00:14:37,206 --> 00:14:40,048
So I try to have either or because it's always,

331
00:14:40,048 --> 00:14:43,671
it's just such a tiny window where you see most GIFs.

332
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:46,093
If needed, if you need more space

333
00:14:46,093 --> 00:14:49,355
or need to cramp up more content in a short GIF,

334
00:14:49,355 --> 00:14:50,696
I sometimes speed up GIFs by 10%.

335
00:14:50,696 --> 00:14:53,058
Obviously it really depends on your game.

336
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:55,140
If you make a super realistic golfing game,

337
00:14:55,140 --> 00:14:56,281
maybe don't speed it up by 50%

338
00:14:56,281 --> 00:14:57,922
and the golfer goes like that.

339
00:14:57,922 --> 00:14:59,103
But if you have a narrative game

340
00:14:59,103 --> 00:15:01,365
and the cursor moves a bit quicker, that's probably fine.

341
00:15:03,016 --> 00:15:05,219
First frame is really, really important.

342
00:15:05,219 --> 00:15:07,442
Never ever have a black screen as a first frame.

343
00:15:07,442 --> 00:15:10,726
The reason for that is often when GIFs don't load

344
00:15:10,726 --> 00:15:12,869
for some reason, if there's preview windows,

345
00:15:12,869 --> 00:15:15,773
you're always gonna see the first screen.

346
00:15:15,773 --> 00:15:16,855
So if there's any issue, that first screen

347
00:15:16,855 --> 00:15:18,657
is a screenshot that shows up instead of a GIF.

348
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,980
And the next tip is start with something eye-catching.

349
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:24,722
We had that short in the beginning.

350
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,944
And I think that's also something Hollywood does quite a lot.

351
00:15:26,944 --> 00:15:29,707
If you look at trailer from really big blockbuster films now,

352
00:15:29,707 --> 00:15:31,530
they often start with like a five second summary

353
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:33,912
of the real trailer and then the trailer starts.

354
00:15:34,272 --> 00:15:38,833
And that, I think, is related with just getting the attention span of people immediately.

355
00:15:38,833 --> 00:15:44,534
That's an example of a game we made in trailer form, actually, for Omno,

356
00:15:44,534 --> 00:15:47,935
which starts really slow and it tries to build up moods.

357
00:15:47,935 --> 00:15:50,375
And we thought that's not going to cut it.

358
00:15:50,375 --> 00:15:54,176
And that's why we cut in the third scene where the guy falls down.

359
00:15:54,176 --> 00:15:55,696
You just see animation really quickly.

360
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:59,030
Well, it's really important to get that mood across for the game.

361
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:02,111
We want to see, we want to definitely show people the animation straight away.

362
00:16:02,111 --> 00:16:06,173
So I think just having a really strong scene just in the first one or two seconds really helps.

363
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:08,654
And that's a really practical gif.

364
00:16:08,654 --> 00:16:10,195
I really like a trick.

365
00:16:10,195 --> 00:16:13,457
I really like that. Recycle your trailer into multiple gifs.

366
00:16:13,457 --> 00:16:15,318
If you can, you finish your trailer first.

367
00:16:16,054 --> 00:16:18,076
And then you take a trailer and cut out 30 seconds of that

368
00:16:18,076 --> 00:16:20,078
and make a teaser trailer of that.

369
00:16:20,078 --> 00:16:22,841
And then you cut out 10 GIFs out of that and the main GIF.

370
00:16:22,841 --> 00:16:24,582
So with that one big trailer asset

371
00:16:24,582 --> 00:16:26,464
that you need to do anyway, you immediately

372
00:16:26,464 --> 00:16:29,347
have a whole bunch of small assets with no extra work.

373
00:16:29,347 --> 00:16:34,312
Step number two after recording and editing a GIF

374
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:36,354
is now we want to compress it.

375
00:16:36,354 --> 00:16:38,256
And there's a website called easygif.com.

376
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:43,224
And it's so good. I don't know why it's so good.

377
00:16:43,224 --> 00:16:45,668
It's a bit criminal. It's for free and you can just

378
00:16:45,668 --> 00:16:46,849
upload your GIFs and

379
00:16:46,849 --> 00:16:49,854
move a couple of sliders around and see how it compresses,

380
00:16:49,854 --> 00:16:52,298
how the image quality changes, how big the GIFs are.

381
00:16:52,298 --> 00:16:54,822
It's so good for really like precisely compressing stuff.

382
00:16:54,822 --> 00:16:55,162
I love it.

383
00:16:56,740 --> 00:17:08,014
If you compress things, if you want to get to certain salfies, it's really important to just figure out what is the most visual aspect of your game and then go from there.

384
00:17:08,014 --> 00:17:12,641
Usually there are three things that fight with each other, which is the frame rate, the length of the GIF and the resolution.

385
00:17:13,547 --> 00:17:16,828
So if a game is like Omno and the animation is really important,

386
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:18,388
you want to probably have a good frame rate.

387
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:20,269
If you want to tell a little story, a little joke,

388
00:17:20,269 --> 00:17:22,790
but it needs to be a bit longer, you want to have certain length.

389
00:17:22,790 --> 00:17:27,251
If you have a game like Eastshade that looks like a really nice painting,

390
00:17:27,251 --> 00:17:28,931
then you probably want to have a nice resolution.

391
00:17:28,931 --> 00:17:31,572
And there's a good chance you can't have all three of those.

392
00:17:31,572 --> 00:17:33,252
So just make sure you know which one you want to have.

393
00:17:35,212 --> 00:17:38,935
Personally, I'm usually aiming for 10 to 20 frames per second for GIFs,

394
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:42,799
sometimes 30 if it's really important about animation.

395
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:45,542
I try to make them 5 to 15 seconds long.

396
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:50,547
For emails, I usually use 500 pixels in width and for social media, usually 600.

397
00:17:53,676 --> 00:17:58,019
If you don't want to do step one and two and go to step zero

398
00:17:58,019 --> 00:17:59,781
and just let the community do the GIFs,

399
00:17:59,781 --> 00:18:00,521
that's also an option.

400
00:18:00,521 --> 00:18:04,044
I think there are surprisingly little games that do that.

401
00:18:04,044 --> 00:18:06,747
A really famous example, I think, is Poly Bridge.

402
00:18:06,747 --> 00:18:08,248
They have a really good GDC talk about that

403
00:18:08,248 --> 00:18:10,610
that is on the vault and on YouTube.

404
00:18:10,610 --> 00:18:12,752
And in the game, you build a little bridge,

405
00:18:12,752 --> 00:18:13,593
and it's physics-based,

406
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,754
so there's a lot of funny stuff happening.

407
00:18:15,754 --> 00:18:17,656
And with the built-in GIF generator,

408
00:18:17,656 --> 00:18:19,498
people were sharing GIFs like crazy,

409
00:18:19,498 --> 00:18:21,479
and there was a really good marketing tool for them.

410
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:26,283
Just from their slides, their top 10 posts on Reddit got 12 million views.

411
00:18:26,283 --> 00:18:29,285
So that was definitely worth the extra worth.

412
00:18:29,285 --> 00:18:35,029
So in my opinion, if you have a physics-based game or a game where people can create stuff and funny things happen,

413
00:18:35,029 --> 00:18:37,111
really consider putting a gift generator in there.

414
00:18:37,943 --> 00:18:40,124
There's also a good evolution from that idea,

415
00:18:40,124 --> 00:18:41,405
from a game called Nebartus.

416
00:18:41,405 --> 00:18:43,645
And they took the idea one step further.

417
00:18:43,645 --> 00:18:45,486
So for the Kickstarter, they had a demo.

418
00:18:45,486 --> 00:18:47,086
And the demo had a gif generator.

419
00:18:47,086 --> 00:18:50,328
And if you generate a gif in there and then tweet about it,

420
00:18:50,328 --> 00:18:52,828
you can win free copies of the game.

421
00:18:52,828 --> 00:18:55,449
So they really get people in to play and share stuff,

422
00:18:55,449 --> 00:18:57,050
while they can also win something.

423
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:58,630
So it's quite nice for the players, I think,

424
00:18:58,630 --> 00:19:03,672
but obviously also great from a PR point of view.

425
00:19:03,672 --> 00:19:05,733
So where and how do you use those gifs?

426
00:19:05,733 --> 00:19:07,873
What is the best way to do that?

427
00:19:08,311 --> 00:19:11,312
Well, there's a lot of channels where you can use GIF.

428
00:19:11,312 --> 00:19:14,013
And if we would go through them one by one in detail,

429
00:19:14,013 --> 00:19:16,054
we would be here for a whole week.

430
00:19:16,054 --> 00:19:18,095
So for today, I'm just going to pick my top five channels

431
00:19:18,095 --> 00:19:20,676
that I think you can make the most out of your GIFs.

432
00:19:20,676 --> 00:19:23,137
And also for that, I have to say, it's a roadmap.

433
00:19:23,137 --> 00:19:24,798
And it gives you some tips per channels.

434
00:19:24,798 --> 00:19:26,758
But it's definitely not a complete thing.

435
00:19:26,758 --> 00:19:29,400
Because there's just so much to do per channel

436
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:31,881
that I'm sure you're going to find way more detailed talks

437
00:19:31,881 --> 00:19:32,741
about each of those.

438
00:19:34,703 --> 00:19:38,444
So my favorite one to use GIFs really good is Twitter.

439
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:39,825
And the one really good thing about Twitter

440
00:19:39,825 --> 00:19:41,205
is if you have a good GIF,

441
00:19:41,205 --> 00:19:44,126
you can really break out of your social media bubble.

442
00:19:44,126 --> 00:19:45,746
So if you get a lot of retweets,

443
00:19:45,746 --> 00:19:48,427
if you get a lot of likes,

444
00:19:48,427 --> 00:19:50,647
your tweets start showing up on timelines

445
00:19:50,647 --> 00:19:53,228
of new people you've never heard before.

446
00:19:53,228 --> 00:19:54,928
So it really helps to just reach new players.

447
00:19:56,718 --> 00:20:00,521
Really good on Twitter is also that movements on timelines

448
00:20:00,521 --> 00:20:01,401
stand out quite a bit.

449
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:03,403
Here's an example from Polygon Treehouse,

450
00:20:03,403 --> 00:20:04,904
a studio in Cambridge.

451
00:20:04,904 --> 00:20:08,247
And they just have a tweet here with text

452
00:20:08,247 --> 00:20:11,209
versus the same with an image versus the same with a GIF.

453
00:20:11,209 --> 00:20:14,091
And you can clearly see that the one with motion

454
00:20:14,091 --> 00:20:16,733
stands out the most in a timeline,

455
00:20:16,733 --> 00:20:18,394
especially if you think how you use Twitter,

456
00:20:18,394 --> 00:20:20,416
you just probably scroll through like that.

457
00:20:20,416 --> 00:20:23,278
So it really helps having that first second animation going.

458
00:20:23,918 --> 00:20:27,582
There's also some stats like David Whealy from the first tree set,

459
00:20:27,582 --> 00:20:31,046
when he shared a GIF versus a screenshot, people were sharing it 10 times as much.

460
00:20:31,046 --> 00:20:34,069
So I think it's really worth having animated GIFs,

461
00:20:34,069 --> 00:20:37,252
even if just promoting a blog post or a small menu or something.

462
00:20:37,252 --> 00:20:39,755
Even then, I think having some kind of motion is really important.

463
00:20:41,610 --> 00:20:45,892
I highly recommend just experiment with screenshot set today.

464
00:20:45,892 --> 00:20:47,332
It's a really popular hashtag.

465
00:20:47,332 --> 00:20:50,574
It helps you to break out of your social media bubble even more.

466
00:20:50,574 --> 00:20:51,995
I would try to do that as often as you can.

467
00:20:51,995 --> 00:20:55,356
And I think also engine text, that's UE4 for the Unreal Engine

468
00:20:55,356 --> 00:21:00,339
and hashtag made with Unity for Unity is a fantastic source to get more traction.

469
00:21:00,339 --> 00:21:03,060
If you use that engine, they like your GIF and they retweet you.

470
00:21:03,060 --> 00:21:05,481
You get a lot of, you know, a lot of new eyes on your game.

471
00:21:05,481 --> 00:21:06,522
And you can do that quite a lot.

472
00:21:08,062 --> 00:21:09,883
And that, I think, is the beauty of Twitter,

473
00:21:09,883 --> 00:21:11,945
that you can basically post as much as you want.

474
00:21:11,945 --> 00:21:13,706
Like, obviously, 10 GIFs per day.

475
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:16,067
But if you post one per week over a long period of time,

476
00:21:16,067 --> 00:21:16,928
that's totally fine.

477
00:21:16,928 --> 00:21:18,769
The people that follow you on Twitter,

478
00:21:18,769 --> 00:21:19,789
they want to see your stuff.

479
00:21:19,789 --> 00:21:22,311
So they won't be offended if you tweet regularly.

480
00:21:22,311 --> 00:21:25,773
And it can really help to reach new people.

481
00:21:25,773 --> 00:21:28,014
In terms of file format, GIFs on Twitter,

482
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:30,216
autoplay and decompression is quite predictable,

483
00:21:30,216 --> 00:21:31,016
which is nice.

484
00:21:31,016 --> 00:21:31,977
So autoplay is a big plus.

485
00:21:31,977 --> 00:21:34,979
If you upload on mobile, you have a 5 megabyte limit

486
00:21:34,979 --> 00:21:36,099
from desktop 15.

487
00:21:36,099 --> 00:21:37,160
And I usually go with a.

488
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:39,691
a pixel width of 600.

489
00:21:39,691 --> 00:21:42,673
There's different preferences that people like.

490
00:21:42,673 --> 00:21:45,855
Some people also like to post more like square GIFs

491
00:21:45,855 --> 00:21:47,236
so they look better on mobile.

492
00:21:47,236 --> 00:21:48,517
I just prefer a YouTube format.

493
00:21:48,517 --> 00:21:51,118
But I think the important thing is the 600 pixels in width.

494
00:21:51,118 --> 00:21:53,419
Also mind that if you post a GIF on Twitter,

495
00:21:53,419 --> 00:21:55,661
often you would have that little logo in the corner

496
00:21:55,661 --> 00:21:56,822
that says GIF.

497
00:21:56,822 --> 00:21:59,303
So if you don't put anything important there,

498
00:21:59,303 --> 00:22:01,965
otherwise you have to reformat your GIF a bit.

499
00:22:02,923 --> 00:22:04,925
You can also upload short videos on Twitter.

500
00:22:04,925 --> 00:22:08,309
If they are under 6.5 seconds, they will auto-loop,

501
00:22:08,309 --> 00:22:10,051
which is great.

502
00:22:10,051 --> 00:22:11,793
They also have sound, and you don't

503
00:22:11,793 --> 00:22:14,436
struggle with file restrictions, which is also great.

504
00:22:14,436 --> 00:22:17,139
One thing, however, I will say that is Twitter sometimes

505
00:22:17,139 --> 00:22:18,601
compresses video really weird.

506
00:22:18,601 --> 00:22:20,944
So if you use video, check if it looks good.

507
00:22:20,944 --> 00:22:22,706
And if it doesn't, maybe go for a GIF instead.

508
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:31,463
Facebook also added GIF support a while back, but I think it's way harder to reach new people with Facebook.

509
00:22:31,463 --> 00:22:37,706
So I just mentioned here that GIF also works. I usually cross post on both platforms, but Twitter is usually the one that gets way more traction.

510
00:22:37,706 --> 00:22:41,927
I think a really underrated platform is Imgur or Imgur.

511
00:22:41,927 --> 00:22:44,729
Don't know how to pronounce it either. I say Imgur now.

512
00:22:46,677 --> 00:22:49,817
If you hit the front page, which is not too hard at the moment,

513
00:22:49,817 --> 00:22:52,058
we have a quite good success rate

514
00:22:52,058 --> 00:22:54,759
because I think it's not so saturated

515
00:22:54,759 --> 00:22:55,579
as the other networks.

516
00:22:55,579 --> 00:22:57,199
You get easily 80,000 to 200,000 views.

517
00:22:57,199 --> 00:22:59,040
What's really popular there is something

518
00:22:59,040 --> 00:23:01,460
that looks like on the right, which is blog posts that

519
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:02,120
are quite personal.

520
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:04,781
And usually what we do is we have a nice headline,

521
00:23:04,781 --> 00:23:07,582
we have a first GIF, and then we describe in a sentence what

522
00:23:07,582 --> 00:23:08,122
is the game.

523
00:23:08,122 --> 00:23:09,502
And then we have another GIF, and then we

524
00:23:09,502 --> 00:23:11,683
describe in a sentence what happened in that GIF,

525
00:23:11,683 --> 00:23:12,163
and so on.

526
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:13,903
And you usually have four or five GIFs,

527
00:23:13,903 --> 00:23:14,863
and then you say goodbye.

528
00:23:15,952 --> 00:23:19,754
Really important on Imgur is that you have a really good headline in the first frame

529
00:23:19,754 --> 00:23:21,996
because that's the only thing that shows up in the preview window.

530
00:23:21,996 --> 00:23:24,397
That's how people are going to find you.

531
00:23:24,397 --> 00:23:27,119
And if they upload you enough, then you go trending.

532
00:23:27,119 --> 00:23:29,781
In terms of file sizes, it's really generous.

533
00:23:29,781 --> 00:23:34,665
You can use up to 200 megabytes per image or per video, up to 30 seconds long.

534
00:23:34,665 --> 00:23:36,206
And Imgur converts GIFs into videos anyway.

535
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:40,148
So you might as well just use videos because it's a bit better quality.

536
00:23:42,192 --> 00:23:46,895
If you are not familiar with Imgur yet and you want to start a new account, it's no problem at all.

537
00:23:46,895 --> 00:23:51,057
It's great for Twitter and Imgur that you can just go in fresh and if you have good content,

538
00:23:51,057 --> 00:23:53,419
it just gets shared and you can really reach new people.

539
00:23:53,419 --> 00:23:56,500
However, they have really strict spam filters.

540
00:23:56,500 --> 00:23:58,922
So in the beginning, don't post any links.

541
00:23:58,922 --> 00:24:01,743
You get a notification once you are mature enough on the platform,

542
00:24:01,743 --> 00:24:04,445
so you can post links, but don't do it in the beginning.

543
00:24:04,445 --> 00:24:07,226
Also, hashtags are really essential, especially game dev and gaming.

544
00:24:07,226 --> 00:24:08,587
This is how people find you in Imgur.

545
00:24:09,992 --> 00:24:13,555
So what I would recommend is having those longer blog posts

546
00:24:13,555 --> 00:24:17,019
for whenever you do a big update, a big announcement,

547
00:24:17,019 --> 00:24:19,621
and just post small little GIFs on Twitter

548
00:24:19,621 --> 00:24:20,783
if you have a good one in between.

549
00:24:22,115 --> 00:24:27,358
Reddit is a bit like the Holy Grail of posting a gift because, you know, on the right we saw one

550
00:24:27,358 --> 00:24:31,280
that has 1.6 million views, the first tree got over 3.5 million views and 50,000 views on the

551
00:24:31,280 --> 00:24:38,744
store page of Steam. So that's really good. The downside of Reddit, however, is like it's really

552
00:24:38,744 --> 00:24:40,845
hard to be successful on Reddit.

553
00:24:42,098 --> 00:24:43,439
but it is doable.

554
00:24:43,439 --> 00:24:44,960
One of the most important things is obviously

555
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:48,141
they have the self promo rules.

556
00:24:48,141 --> 00:24:50,162
So only 10% of your posts can be about your work

557
00:24:50,162 --> 00:24:50,862
and your game.

558
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,303
So you have to just be part of the community,

559
00:24:53,303 --> 00:24:55,364
talk to people, post in other subreddits.

560
00:24:55,364 --> 00:24:56,124
So you hit that quota.

561
00:24:56,124 --> 00:25:00,385
That's why it's also advisable to start an account early.

562
00:25:00,385 --> 00:25:01,106
And I think.

563
00:25:01,718 --> 00:25:04,340
The big one is each subreddit has different rules.

564
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:05,621
They all work a bit differently.

565
00:25:05,621 --> 00:25:07,583
They all have different moderators.

566
00:25:07,583 --> 00:25:10,105
If you really want to take it seriously on Reddit,

567
00:25:10,105 --> 00:25:12,947
I think you really have to work through those rules,

568
00:25:12,947 --> 00:25:15,549
look at the community for a while, start talking to them

569
00:25:15,549 --> 00:25:17,751
and just like don't go in and try to market your thing,

570
00:25:17,751 --> 00:25:20,233
but really try to be part of the community,

571
00:25:20,233 --> 00:25:21,274
but it really pays off.

572
00:25:22,450 --> 00:25:26,311
Often really personal headlines work where people say,

573
00:25:26,311 --> 00:25:28,132
oh, I've been working on my game for five years,

574
00:25:28,132 --> 00:25:31,293
for like two years I've been working with my wife on my game.

575
00:25:31,293 --> 00:25:35,055
All that kind of stuff is usually good to just get people's attention

576
00:25:35,055 --> 00:25:38,657
that really that I'm a small indie dev or I'm a developer,

577
00:25:38,657 --> 00:25:39,837
I'm passionate about that.

578
00:25:39,837 --> 00:25:41,518
That's the kind of stuff that usually works.

579
00:25:42,396 --> 00:25:46,119
You can upload direct video or you can upload gif-like gif-icads.

580
00:25:46,119 --> 00:25:51,322
The only thing that I would never do is put YouTube links or store pages on Reddit.

581
00:25:51,322 --> 00:25:54,104
That's stuff that usually doesn't fly well in most subreddits.

582
00:25:54,104 --> 00:25:58,147
And for Reddit I would also say be part of the community but don't overthink it.

583
00:25:58,147 --> 00:26:01,530
It's the same with Twitter. Just post stuff and see what sticks.

584
00:26:01,530 --> 00:26:04,011
Often you have a quite good idea of what is popular about your game,

585
00:26:04,011 --> 00:26:06,373
but I tell you there were so many times when we were super surprised

586
00:26:06,373 --> 00:26:10,336
what is actually the thing that people get really excited about your game.

587
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,842
The next one, point number four, is emails.

588
00:26:15,842 --> 00:26:17,543
And this is a pitch email we sent to press

589
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,285
of a game called Lachledian Skies.

590
00:26:19,285 --> 00:26:21,066
And it's an all right email.

591
00:26:21,066 --> 00:26:23,928
It has like bullet points and bold writing and links.

592
00:26:23,928 --> 00:26:26,649
So it's quite well formatted for what it is.

593
00:26:26,649 --> 00:26:29,051
But now we look at the same email

594
00:26:29,051 --> 00:26:31,773
where we changed the game description with an actual GIF.

595
00:26:31,773 --> 00:26:34,194
And then you can see that that email isn't only way shorter,

596
00:26:34,194 --> 00:26:36,876
it also looks way better because suddenly

597
00:26:36,876 --> 00:26:38,197
you can understand the game mechanic

598
00:26:38,197 --> 00:26:39,858
that is really complicated to explain.

599
00:26:41,823 --> 00:26:46,625
So my definite top tip for GIFs is put them in emails right away.

600
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:52,687
We use that if you pitch to press, publishers, influencers, to your fans, newsletters, all that kind of stuff.

601
00:26:52,687 --> 00:26:59,448
I think whenever you promote your game, putting that GIF right in is really, really helpful.

602
00:27:00,027 --> 00:27:05,593
One warning that not all email programs support GIFs and really it is Outlook that doesn't support

603
00:27:05,593 --> 00:27:10,277
it too well especially older Outlook versions than UseOne does. So depending on your target

604
00:27:10,277 --> 00:27:14,422
group you might need to think about that. If for some reason you only mail people with old Outlook

605
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,904
maybe don't use GIFs but if that's not the case go for GIFs.

606
00:27:17,810 --> 00:27:19,852
Again, mind the first frame.

607
00:27:19,852 --> 00:27:21,713
If a GIF doesn't load in an email for some reason,

608
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:25,036
it will take the first frame as a screenshot and just show that.

609
00:27:25,036 --> 00:27:29,939
I usually aim to have a GIF between 1 and 4 MB in an email

610
00:27:29,939 --> 00:27:32,401
or up to 8 MB if you want to push it.

611
00:27:32,401 --> 00:27:35,723
For example, if we email influencers, YouTubers and streamers,

612
00:27:35,723 --> 00:27:39,946
we go up to 8 MB because often they're going to work on PCs anyway,

613
00:27:39,946 --> 00:27:41,908
on desktop, and they have good internet connection,

614
00:27:41,908 --> 00:27:43,109
so it's not a problem.

615
00:27:43,109 --> 00:27:45,170
But if you deal with mobile users, that's maybe a bit much.

616
00:27:46,782 --> 00:27:51,995
And here are the dimensions of a post, GIFs and emails usually try to aim between 350 and 600px.

617
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:54,985
And the last point is store pages.

618
00:27:54,985 --> 00:27:57,405
Steam supports GIFs officially for a while now,

619
00:27:57,405 --> 00:27:58,245
which is great.

620
00:27:58,245 --> 00:28:00,986
You can use them in banners or just to show your game.

621
00:28:00,986 --> 00:28:02,786
This is House Flippers, a really great example,

622
00:28:02,786 --> 00:28:05,567
and they show the game mechanics in a two-second GIF

623
00:28:05,567 --> 00:28:06,767
and make it look really interesting, I think.

624
00:28:06,767 --> 00:28:10,688
You can also use GIFs in community updates,

625
00:28:10,688 --> 00:28:12,069
which is cool for updates,

626
00:28:12,069 --> 00:28:14,149
and you can use them in the award section.

627
00:28:14,149 --> 00:28:17,050
The only thing is that the whole Steam page

628
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:21,111
shouldn't have more than 15 megabytes of combined assets.

629
00:28:22,250 --> 00:28:24,271
And the last point is Kickstarter.

630
00:28:24,271 --> 00:28:25,832
You can use gifts as well for banners,

631
00:28:25,832 --> 00:28:27,593
for game gifts, for rewards.

632
00:28:27,593 --> 00:28:30,074
And I think really important there is,

633
00:28:30,074 --> 00:28:31,395
we here we have a Kickstarter page

634
00:28:31,395 --> 00:28:33,056
and you're gonna get a lot of traffic,

635
00:28:33,056 --> 00:28:35,457
but only a very small section of those people on your page

636
00:28:35,457 --> 00:28:37,638
will actually click on a video and watch it.

637
00:28:37,638 --> 00:28:38,939
So what I would highly recommend

638
00:28:38,939 --> 00:28:40,139
is just having a gift quite on top

639
00:28:40,139 --> 00:28:42,341
that those people that don't click on a video

640
00:28:42,341 --> 00:28:43,681
or don't necessarily wanna watch it,

641
00:28:43,681 --> 00:28:45,262
still see your game in motion.

642
00:28:47,329 --> 00:28:48,890
And they don't have any file size limits,

643
00:28:48,890 --> 00:28:51,171
but of course, keep in mind that you don't put up

644
00:28:51,171 --> 00:28:53,653
like five gigabytes of GIFs, because then the site probably

645
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,033
just breaks.

646
00:28:54,033 --> 00:28:57,275
So just a summary slide for the end.

647
00:28:57,275 --> 00:29:00,457
Plan your GIF is step number one.

648
00:29:00,457 --> 00:29:03,538
I think really important to plan GIFs properly in your PR plan

649
00:29:03,538 --> 00:29:06,440
and save time so you can actually make them.

650
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,801
Prepare for main GIFs.

651
00:29:07,801 --> 00:29:10,422
Remember the rules for the GIFs that keep on giving.

652
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:18,354
If you go into GIF making, firstly, you want to record your video with on-screen recording

653
00:29:18,354 --> 00:29:22,315
with the different tools we talked about. Then go to compression, easygif.com, highly,

654
00:29:22,315 --> 00:29:27,538
highly recommended. And think about which aspect, which visual aspect out of those three is the

655
00:29:27,538 --> 00:29:32,179
most important for your GIF. Always keep in mind, if you have a trailer, recycle it,

656
00:29:32,179 --> 00:29:37,021
make 100 GIFs out of it, really useful, why not? And whenever you do a GIF,

657
00:29:37,021 --> 00:29:39,242
mind the first frame and make sure the first frame is really good.

658
00:29:40,702 --> 00:29:43,544
To posting your gifs, Twitter is my favorite channel.

659
00:29:43,544 --> 00:29:46,306
Movement really stands out there and you can experiment

660
00:29:46,306 --> 00:29:49,209
and break out of your social bubble a lot.

661
00:29:49,209 --> 00:29:52,632
Imgur is at the moment really good for games to reach people.

662
00:29:52,632 --> 00:29:53,692
First frame is important.

663
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:55,734
Headline is really important.

664
00:29:55,734 --> 00:29:57,135
And never ever forget the hashtags

665
00:29:57,135 --> 00:29:59,337
because otherwise your posts just disappear.

666
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:04,852
On Reddit, there's no easy rule apart from try to really be part of the community and

667
00:30:04,852 --> 00:30:11,397
try to understand it, live with it, write comments and see how other people do stuff.

668
00:30:11,397 --> 00:30:15,020
In emails, always post GIFs in them if you can, but really mind the file sizes.

669
00:30:15,020 --> 00:30:17,562
For the Steam store page, the same.

670
00:30:17,562 --> 00:30:20,544
Really great to use GIFs, but wouldn't go over 15 megabytes.

671
00:30:20,544 --> 00:30:25,728
And on Kickstarter, I would definitely focus on the top GIF just under the trailer so people

672
00:30:25,728 --> 00:30:29,691
see a game in motion anyway, even if they don't watch the video.

673
00:30:29,691 --> 00:30:30,532
Thanks a lot for listening.
