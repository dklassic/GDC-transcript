1
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:08,353
Visual effects and the rise of real time.

2
00:00:08,353 --> 00:00:08,773
That's our talk.

3
00:00:08,773 --> 00:00:12,662
If there's one thing that I want you guys to take away

4
00:00:12,662 --> 00:00:15,067
from this talk, it's that real time visual effects is

5
00:00:15,067 --> 00:00:16,510
expanding beyond games.

6
00:00:18,016 --> 00:00:20,137
It's never been easier to get started,

7
00:00:20,137 --> 00:00:21,478
and let's build the future together.

8
00:00:21,478 --> 00:00:25,100
So Keith and I have a whole lot to say on all these topics.

9
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:28,062
Like I said, we probably have too much to say,

10
00:00:28,062 --> 00:00:29,843
so we're gonna burn through it.

11
00:00:29,843 --> 00:00:32,404
Overview of the broad sections we're gonna be covering,

12
00:00:32,404 --> 00:00:34,886
why VFX Bootcamp now, that's why we think the timing

13
00:00:34,886 --> 00:00:36,867
is perfect for this event for today.

14
00:00:36,867 --> 00:00:41,490
Keith's gonna speak to building our community

15
00:00:41,490 --> 00:00:43,511
and ways that we can do that better and bigger.

16
00:00:44,407 --> 00:00:46,828
He's going to talk about visual effects gems

17
00:00:46,828 --> 00:00:48,029
from our community.

18
00:00:48,029 --> 00:00:49,950
I'm super excited for this section.

19
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:52,512
Then I'm going to take it in a little bit more

20
00:00:52,512 --> 00:00:54,193
of a narrow focus, talk about Tilt Brush,

21
00:00:54,193 --> 00:00:57,715
Case Study, taking old tricks in new places,

22
00:00:57,715 --> 00:01:00,277
and then we'll take the 10,000 foot view

23
00:01:00,277 --> 00:01:02,618
and try and get a picture on where all this is going.

24
00:01:02,618 --> 00:01:05,100
So why VFX Bootcamp now?

25
00:01:06,708 --> 00:01:08,629
Well, we're at an inflection point.

26
00:01:08,629 --> 00:01:12,731
That's the most important feature of the landscape of

27
00:01:12,731 --> 00:01:13,611
visual effects right now.

28
00:01:13,611 --> 00:01:15,192
There's this really dramatic inflection point.

29
00:01:15,192 --> 00:01:17,693
And that's driven by a number of factors.

30
00:01:17,693 --> 00:01:21,075
One of the most significant is this powerful common baseline

31
00:01:21,075 --> 00:01:22,235
for tools and engines.

32
00:01:23,215 --> 00:01:26,296
We've got things like Unreal and Unity

33
00:01:26,296 --> 00:01:28,177
that we take for granted now, at least I take for granted.

34
00:01:28,177 --> 00:01:29,998
But if you think back a few years ago,

35
00:01:29,998 --> 00:01:32,059
actually wasn't the case.

36
00:01:32,059 --> 00:01:34,820
And my work in Tilt Brush in particular,

37
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:36,380
Tilt Brush is built on Unity.

38
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,761
We wouldn't have left our job in games

39
00:01:38,761 --> 00:01:41,823
and pursue something different if Unity didn't exist.

40
00:01:41,823 --> 00:01:44,084
So these tools are already changing the landscape

41
00:01:44,084 --> 00:01:46,005
and changing the options that are available to us.

42
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:49,548
Every year at the visual effects roundtable,

43
00:01:49,548 --> 00:01:50,968
we do one of these show of hands.

44
00:01:50,968 --> 00:01:53,289
Who's looking for work and who's got an open position?

45
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:56,290
And every year it's absurdly lopsided.

46
00:01:56,290 --> 00:01:58,931
There's never enough people to fill the open positions.

47
00:01:58,931 --> 00:02:02,152
And if you believe the high-level concept

48
00:02:02,152 --> 00:02:03,252
behind this talk,

49
00:02:03,252 --> 00:02:05,253
that problem's gonna get a whole lot worse.

50
00:02:05,253 --> 00:02:09,074
There's also a platform explosion.

51
00:02:09,074 --> 00:02:12,715
And we'll be revisiting this again at the end of the talk.

52
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:15,416
Thanks to Matt Radford for the awesome stylized explosion.

53
00:02:18,339 --> 00:02:23,923
Another important factor to call out, we started this group, Facebook, the Facebook group,

54
00:02:23,923 --> 00:02:27,305
Real Time VFX, maybe 2012, I think is when we started it.

55
00:02:27,305 --> 00:02:29,847
And it's blown up.

56
00:02:29,847 --> 00:02:31,228
It's almost 2,000 members.

57
00:02:31,228 --> 00:02:33,410
It's grown really, really, really fast.

58
00:02:36,058 --> 00:02:39,099
Kind of in response to that, my amazing co-presenter,

59
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:42,160
Keith Garett, he took it upon himself to build us

60
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:45,541
RealtimeVFX.com, which is a community, a place online

61
00:02:45,541 --> 00:02:47,542
where we can come together and we can share our ideas

62
00:02:47,542 --> 00:02:49,082
and we can grow together.

63
00:02:49,082 --> 00:02:51,823
I'm super, super honored to get to share the stage with him.

64
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:54,264
If you're not familiar with Keith's work,

65
00:02:54,264 --> 00:02:56,725
he was the lead VFX artist at Naughty Dog.

66
00:02:56,725 --> 00:02:59,766
He did some notable titles like Uncharted 2, 3, and 4.

67
00:02:59,766 --> 00:03:01,007
He worked on Last of Us.

68
00:03:01,297 --> 00:03:03,539
He's been active in the community since it formed,

69
00:03:03,539 --> 00:03:06,682
sharing his experiences and his knowledge with us.

70
00:03:06,682 --> 00:03:09,985
Recently, he co-produced the Game Makers Inside Story.

71
00:03:09,985 --> 00:03:11,167
He did that with Jenny Kong,

72
00:03:11,167 --> 00:03:14,230
who's a writer from film, moving into games.

73
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,592
It's a 10-part web series about storytelling in games.

74
00:03:16,592 --> 00:03:17,953
It's free on YouTube right now.

75
00:03:17,953 --> 00:03:18,994
You should definitely check it out.

76
00:03:19,555 --> 00:03:23,396
And he just launched his own studio, Beyond Effects.

77
00:03:23,396 --> 00:03:25,217
It's a visual effects studio in LA.

78
00:03:25,217 --> 00:03:28,478
It has a super intriguing business model

79
00:03:28,478 --> 00:03:30,158
that very much relates to everything

80
00:03:30,158 --> 00:03:31,338
we're talking about today.

81
00:03:31,338 --> 00:03:33,279
We don't have time to cover it right now,

82
00:03:33,279 --> 00:03:34,199
but if you're curious,

83
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:35,980
be sure to ask him about it in the Q&A.

84
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:39,021
And so now, yeah, it's my honor, my privilege,

85
00:03:39,021 --> 00:03:39,501
hand it over to Keith.

86
00:03:39,501 --> 00:03:39,761
Thank you.

87
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:39,961
Yes, Keith.

88
00:03:39,961 --> 00:03:40,381
Thank you, Keith.

89
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:40,441
So,

90
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,502
I prepared a few notes.

91
00:03:50,502 --> 00:03:56,706
I wanted to go over all the cool things that people have been doing in our community and

92
00:03:56,706 --> 00:03:58,007
sharing with us.

93
00:03:58,007 --> 00:04:01,349
And it's a long run.

94
00:04:01,349 --> 00:04:01,669
No.

95
00:04:03,742 --> 00:04:07,183
The truth is that I wanted to take a few moments basically

96
00:04:07,183 --> 00:04:11,344
just to express all the cool things that everyone's

97
00:04:11,344 --> 00:04:13,104
been sharing with us across all the different platforms

98
00:04:13,104 --> 00:04:14,705
that we have.

99
00:04:14,705 --> 00:04:16,485
To introduce the subject a little bit more though,

100
00:04:16,485 --> 00:04:18,946
I wanna take a step back and just discuss

101
00:04:18,946 --> 00:04:19,906
where we're at with effects.

102
00:04:19,906 --> 00:04:22,326
I think one of the takeaways you guys are gonna see

103
00:04:22,326 --> 00:04:24,887
from this week at GDC is that everybody

104
00:04:24,887 --> 00:04:27,208
across every little facet of the industry

105
00:04:27,208 --> 00:04:29,428
is coming up with freaking insane solutions

106
00:04:29,428 --> 00:04:32,289
for random problems.

107
00:04:32,289 --> 00:04:33,209
And yet at the same time.

108
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:37,432
Our roles are changing along with that.

109
00:04:37,432 --> 00:04:39,293
We're no longer just doing particle simulations,

110
00:04:39,293 --> 00:04:41,414
we're also doing illustration simulations.

111
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:43,616
We're rigging, we're programming, we're compositing,

112
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,397
we're building tools, we're animating, we're modeling.

113
00:04:46,397 --> 00:04:52,121
The tasks that we do daily is changing at an overwhelming,

114
00:04:52,121 --> 00:04:54,202
if not inspiring and breathtaking rate

115
00:04:54,202 --> 00:04:55,743
directly in front of us, and yet we're constantly

116
00:04:55,743 --> 00:04:57,765
expected to keep up with it.

117
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:02,628
Every single company that I've been to is trying to reinvent the wheel over and over

118
00:05:02,628 --> 00:05:06,312
and over again to maintain that competitive edge, yet we haven't really been doing that

119
00:05:06,312 --> 00:05:07,313
great of a job sharing it.

120
00:05:07,313 --> 00:05:16,201
And that's kind of the reason why it means so much to me that Drew started the VFX Roundtable

121
00:05:16,201 --> 00:05:17,683
five years ago, six years ago, right?

122
00:05:19,796 --> 00:05:21,877
We finally had a platform for us to come together

123
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,437
and discuss all the pains and woes

124
00:05:23,437 --> 00:05:25,898
and awesome solutions that we were actually experiencing.

125
00:05:25,898 --> 00:05:27,339
We could start to plan out the future

126
00:05:27,339 --> 00:05:28,379
of where our tools should go,

127
00:05:28,379 --> 00:05:30,640
where our hopes and dreams and ambitions

128
00:05:30,640 --> 00:05:33,221
as effects artists should be taking us.

129
00:05:33,221 --> 00:05:36,002
At the same time, David Johnson and a few others

130
00:05:36,002 --> 00:05:37,902
founded the visual effects group on Facebook,

131
00:05:37,902 --> 00:05:41,024
and we finally had a place to share just badass references,

132
00:05:41,024 --> 00:05:43,865
cool explosions, the actual solutions and tutorials.

133
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:48,027
Around the same time, other artists like Jason Kaiser were creating

134
00:05:48,027 --> 00:05:51,470
amazing YouTube channels, which to this day is probably the best

135
00:05:51,470 --> 00:05:54,992
single resource for learning how to do illustrative effects that I've ever found.

136
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:58,855
One of two, in fact. And ViewFX is the only other place that I can point students to

137
00:05:58,855 --> 00:06:01,697
when they're learning how to do effects.

138
00:06:01,697 --> 00:06:04,418
Unfortunately, Bill Kladis moved on to bigger, better things with Epic,

139
00:06:04,418 --> 00:06:08,181
but his resources from ViewFX are still some of the best.

140
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:15,891
And so, through all that, I spent time sitting here wishing there was a way to Google this.

141
00:06:15,891 --> 00:06:19,674
Wishing that there was a way that I could go online and just go to Google and type in...

142
00:06:21,008 --> 00:06:22,529
UV offsets per particle in Unity,

143
00:06:22,529 --> 00:06:25,311
and have it actually return something useful.

144
00:06:25,311 --> 00:06:27,372
Like I wanted a way for effects artists

145
00:06:27,372 --> 00:06:30,194
to find resources to the challenges that they were facing.

146
00:06:30,194 --> 00:06:32,415
And at the same time, I feel like businesses

147
00:06:32,415 --> 00:06:34,417
should be able to target us as effects artists

148
00:06:34,417 --> 00:06:35,978
to run into our community.

149
00:06:35,978 --> 00:06:37,719
Other artists that want to make tutorials

150
00:06:37,719 --> 00:06:38,980
should have an audience somewhere

151
00:06:38,980 --> 00:06:40,741
that they could go to to find it.

152
00:06:40,741 --> 00:06:42,462
And so we created Realtime VFX.

153
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:46,265
It's fully Googleable, it's fully archived,

154
00:06:46,265 --> 00:06:47,505
and that's freaking awesome.

155
00:06:47,505 --> 00:06:47,645
Cool.

156
00:06:47,645 --> 00:06:47,685
So.

157
00:06:52,048 --> 00:06:55,773
What I really want to be up here talking about is the fact that this is our community.

158
00:06:55,773 --> 00:06:57,035
We made this for us.

159
00:06:57,035 --> 00:06:59,098
We're not trying to drive a profit out of it.

160
00:06:59,098 --> 00:07:02,943
We're trying to enhance the visual effects industry because that's the career that we're

161
00:07:02,943 --> 00:07:05,426
all excited about, that we're all here for.

162
00:07:05,426 --> 00:07:06,427
In that same vein...

163
00:07:07,816 --> 00:07:10,498
Any opportunities that you guys see out there,

164
00:07:10,498 --> 00:07:11,659
please reach out to us.

165
00:07:11,659 --> 00:07:13,220
We wanna help you make that into something

166
00:07:13,220 --> 00:07:14,021
that we can all use.

167
00:07:14,021 --> 00:07:15,682
So for example, Jason Kaiser approached me

168
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:16,623
about making Jobs Board.

169
00:07:16,623 --> 00:07:18,284
And we've launched this.

170
00:07:18,284 --> 00:07:20,565
It's still got some ways to go,

171
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:22,987
but we're trying to make a resource for people,

172
00:07:22,987 --> 00:07:24,769
for recruiters to find effects artists,

173
00:07:24,769 --> 00:07:27,330
for effects artists to find amazing jobs.

174
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:28,752
Nathan Lane has been going through

175
00:07:28,752 --> 00:07:31,233
and actually building a community challenge.

176
00:07:31,654 --> 00:07:35,175
concept where we're doing monthly effects challenges similar to like the

177
00:07:35,175 --> 00:07:39,158
30 second animation club but for effects for us to step outside of our comfort zone.

178
00:07:39,158 --> 00:07:46,161
In that same vein tonight we're actually going to be announcing our very first ever sponsored

179
00:07:46,161 --> 00:07:51,524
community challenge sponsored by Popcorn Effects and SideFX. So at the mixer tonight we'll have all the full details on that but

180
00:07:51,524 --> 00:07:55,386
the point of all this is to say that to all of you from us

181
00:07:55,386 --> 00:07:59,228
please get off your asses, help us make this better.

182
00:08:01,732 --> 00:08:03,393
Our entire industry is about to explode.

183
00:08:03,393 --> 00:08:08,096
That's going to be the caveat, the summary of what Drew's up

184
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:08,817
here talking about.

185
00:08:08,817 --> 00:08:11,659
And we have such an amazing opportunity in front of us to

186
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:15,002
make our little niche industry into whatever we want.

187
00:08:15,002 --> 00:08:15,722
So we're all here to help.

188
00:08:17,247 --> 00:08:20,169
The other part of what I really want to talk to you guys about is just some cool

189
00:08:20,169 --> 00:08:22,850
freaking takeaways that I've been seeing coming out of the community over the

190
00:08:22,850 --> 00:08:24,050
last few years.

191
00:08:24,050 --> 00:08:27,752
So everything that I'm going to share today is coming from a tutorial that somebody

192
00:08:27,752 --> 00:08:32,254
posted online, a post, even just mentions and answers to questions across the

193
00:08:32,254 --> 00:08:35,296
Facebook group, the forum, Twitter, everywhere.

194
00:08:36,244 --> 00:08:41,688
I have a ton of content in here and I'm obviously skimming thousands of posts for other things,

195
00:08:41,688 --> 00:08:46,011
so the takeaway here is that these are all really cool innovations that we're sharing

196
00:08:46,011 --> 00:08:50,113
as a community and that are becoming adopted as industry standards.

197
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:56,938
To start us off with that, just to set the scene, if you think back to like 2013, the

198
00:08:56,938 --> 00:08:58,879
PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One had just come out.

199
00:09:00,193 --> 00:09:03,377
For us as effects artists, it was a big deal.

200
00:09:03,377 --> 00:09:05,059
I mean, obviously for the entire industry it was a big deal,

201
00:09:05,059 --> 00:09:06,501
but for us it meant that we finally had

202
00:09:06,501 --> 00:09:08,864
a little bit of wiggle room to start to innovate.

203
00:09:08,864 --> 00:09:12,068
So we had stronger CPUs, we had way stronger GPUs,

204
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:13,770
and we had a lot more texture memory.

205
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:17,395
Of course, we had absolutely no idea how to use any of it.

206
00:09:18,559 --> 00:09:21,900
So we kind of lost our shits collectively over GPU particles,

207
00:09:21,900 --> 00:09:24,061
which, you know, we could spawn just thousands and thousands

208
00:09:24,061 --> 00:09:26,182
of particles and make awesome effects,

209
00:09:26,182 --> 00:09:27,222
really, really cool stuff.

210
00:09:27,222 --> 00:09:29,963
The other side of that that we also immediately

211
00:09:29,963 --> 00:09:31,804
stepped up to is that texture space.

212
00:09:31,804 --> 00:09:33,404
Like we could finally do a lot more flip books.

213
00:09:33,404 --> 00:09:37,325
For those of you guys that know me,

214
00:09:37,325 --> 00:09:39,426
I'm pretty vocal about the problems

215
00:09:39,426 --> 00:09:40,406
with pre-rendered flip books,

216
00:09:40,406 --> 00:09:43,988
particularly if you're new and you're learning.

217
00:09:43,988 --> 00:09:45,608
I don't really need to go into them,

218
00:09:45,608 --> 00:09:47,709
but since you guys are my audience and I'm on stage,

219
00:09:47,709 --> 00:09:48,369
I'm going to anyway.

220
00:09:50,849 --> 00:09:54,034
So if you're doing a flipbook, you're bound by file size.

221
00:09:54,034 --> 00:09:56,358
As soon as you are limited by a file size.

222
00:09:56,358 --> 00:09:56,438
Uh-oh.

223
00:09:56,438 --> 00:09:57,800
As soon as you're limited by a file size.

224
00:10:05,645 --> 00:10:08,865
It's a lose-lose situation of the resolution that you're giving each

225
00:10:08,865 --> 00:10:12,046
individual frame of that file size or your frame rate.

226
00:10:12,046 --> 00:10:15,527
So in this case, I've got a 64-frame simulation that's lasting 3 seconds.

227
00:10:15,527 --> 00:10:16,727
Now, 3 seconds is not long.

228
00:10:16,727 --> 00:10:20,408
You're going to be hard-pressed to find a flipbook that needs to last only 3 seconds.

229
00:10:20,408 --> 00:10:26,049
But with this minimal case, 64 frames across 3 seconds, we're getting 21 frames a second.

230
00:10:26,049 --> 00:10:26,929
It's not bad.

231
00:10:26,929 --> 00:10:30,150
If you're playing in a 60-frame-per-second game, you will see that.

232
00:10:31,876 --> 00:10:34,579
But you can see that each individual frame is fairly low res.

233
00:10:34,579 --> 00:10:36,260
This is a shitty looking explosion, right?

234
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:38,542
It's super pixelated, it's not great.

235
00:10:38,542 --> 00:10:40,344
So I could bias that, I could go 32 frames

236
00:10:40,344 --> 00:10:42,206
and give each frame more resolution.

237
00:10:42,206 --> 00:10:44,228
But then we start to really hit that frame rate.

238
00:10:44,228 --> 00:10:46,510
This is on a 512 texture, so of course,

239
00:10:46,510 --> 00:10:49,353
if I didn't care too much about my texture memory,

240
00:10:49,353 --> 00:10:51,695
I could go up to 1024, I could go up to 2K, 4K, whatever.

241
00:10:51,695 --> 00:10:55,239
But then I'm burning through that texture memory.

242
00:10:55,239 --> 00:10:56,760
And God help you if you want randomization.

243
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:03,501
So my general feelings on flipbooks

244
00:11:03,501 --> 00:11:05,283
is that we just shouldn't do them

245
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:07,604
unless we're extremely, extremely careful

246
00:11:07,604 --> 00:11:08,565
about their pros and cons.

247
00:11:08,565 --> 00:11:12,167
If you can be extremely careful about your pros and cons,

248
00:11:12,167 --> 00:11:13,828
I do honestly believe that flipbooks

249
00:11:13,828 --> 00:11:15,649
are the single most powerful tool in our toolbox

250
00:11:15,649 --> 00:11:17,471
because there's just no other way

251
00:11:17,471 --> 00:11:19,272
that we can encapsulate that much motion in detail.

252
00:11:19,272 --> 00:11:22,054
So what I wanna go into is just some of the cool ways

253
00:11:22,054 --> 00:11:23,154
people are improving flipbooks.

254
00:11:23,154 --> 00:11:26,276
I'm pretty sure most of you guys have seen this.

255
00:11:26,276 --> 00:11:27,237
This is from Clemon.

256
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:33,711
And he's showing a technique of using motion vectors

257
00:11:33,711 --> 00:11:35,891
to sort of blend between the frames of a flipbook

258
00:11:35,891 --> 00:11:38,012
so you end up with super smooth motion.

259
00:11:38,012 --> 00:11:42,254
I know that the team at Gorilla

260
00:11:42,254 --> 00:11:43,074
had been using this for a while

261
00:11:43,074 --> 00:11:45,575
and I'm sure a lot of other developers in odd pockets had,

262
00:11:45,575 --> 00:11:47,415
but Clemens Post I think was the first time

263
00:11:47,415 --> 00:11:49,656
that he collectively lit a fire under all of our asses

264
00:11:49,656 --> 00:11:51,157
to go and explore this approach.

265
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:52,737
So what's actually going on here?

266
00:11:53,969 --> 00:11:57,312
If we go back to flow, and I'm going to throw back to my own presentation just because I

267
00:11:57,312 --> 00:12:03,317
had these assets in this very timeless GDC 2012 presentation, flow or vector displacement

268
00:12:03,317 --> 00:12:08,743
is just a technique where you tell each pixel to move in a certain direction over time.

269
00:12:08,743 --> 00:12:11,565
So in this case I'm painting a texture, here's me applying it, right?

270
00:12:11,565 --> 00:12:15,209
So you can see that I'm stretching that grid in very specific directions.

271
00:12:15,209 --> 00:12:19,173
That allows me to do all kinds of cool and interesting things based off of textures.

272
00:12:22,275 --> 00:12:25,418
But if we go back to this flipbook, and let's slow it down a little bit so we can see it.

273
00:12:25,418 --> 00:12:34,165
What I can do is I can actually interpret vectors that I need to displace between these frames so that they blur together.

274
00:12:35,347 --> 00:12:39,050
So from frame A to B here, the texture that that looks like is on the right.

275
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:43,253
Obviously this is skimming, but just trying to give you guys the idea.

276
00:12:43,253 --> 00:12:47,917
There's a lot of different ways you can go about generating these quite easily.

277
00:12:47,917 --> 00:12:51,340
Houdini has some. There's a great After Effects plugin called Twixtor.

278
00:12:51,340 --> 00:12:56,244
But right now my absolute favorite is a tool called Slate Editor,

279
00:12:56,244 --> 00:12:58,726
created by one of our very own, Alexander Hill.

280
00:12:58,726 --> 00:13:00,207
So here's my little plug for him.

281
00:13:00,207 --> 00:13:03,990
I think the vectors that I've gotten out of his tool are the best I've ever seen.

282
00:13:04,590 --> 00:13:07,771
It's got my approval.

283
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:20,475
If we apply that output to this when it plays.

284
00:13:20,475 --> 00:13:22,076
Finally hit a negative on this.

285
00:13:22,076 --> 00:13:24,257
I'm going to hop back then just to give you guys.

286
00:13:24,257 --> 00:13:28,218
We'll go back to Clemens' example.

287
00:13:38,152 --> 00:13:43,073
So what the explosion is doing basically is every single frame of the flip book.

288
00:13:43,073 --> 00:13:48,555
It's getting the vectors needed to blend into the next frame and then smoothly interpolating between them.

289
00:13:48,555 --> 00:13:54,397
You can see that obviously the image on the right is way way better than the image on the left, especially slowed down.

290
00:13:54,397 --> 00:13:58,238
So this gives us a lot of flexibility in the way we're presenting our effects.

291
00:13:58,238 --> 00:14:00,479
Forgive me as I hop way forward now.

292
00:14:00,479 --> 00:14:06,281
The benefits of the of of motion vector flip books are kind of huge.

293
00:14:06,281 --> 00:14:07,882
We can actually get away with.

294
00:14:09,127 --> 00:14:13,289
super super slow flip books playing back and not killer are presentation of

295
00:14:13,289 --> 00:14:13,709
framerate

296
00:14:13,709 --> 00:14:17,911
uh... that in it of itself is a massive solution for folks the negatives however

297
00:14:17,911 --> 00:14:19,772
is that it does require for textural cups

298
00:14:19,772 --> 00:14:23,753
because you need a to be of the flip book and you also the a and b of the

299
00:14:23,753 --> 00:14:24,974
motion vectors

300
00:14:24,974 --> 00:14:27,915
for sales motion vectors can be small but there's some

301
00:14:27,915 --> 00:14:29,856
negatives associated with a sampling that many textures

302
00:14:30,697 --> 00:14:34,042
Of course, if you're looking for more resources,

303
00:14:34,042 --> 00:14:36,646
Clemens' tutorial on this is amazing.

304
00:14:36,646 --> 00:14:39,951
He runs you through how to create this shader exactly in Unreal,

305
00:14:39,951 --> 00:14:41,934
so I'd highly recommend checking it out.

306
00:14:41,934 --> 00:14:45,700
There's also a great discussion on the Realtime VFX Forum.

307
00:14:47,336 --> 00:14:48,496
My little plug.

308
00:14:48,496 --> 00:14:51,358
If you're Naughty Dog, you can actually do this at real time,

309
00:14:51,358 --> 00:14:52,078
which is kind of cool.

310
00:14:52,078 --> 00:14:53,979
So you don't actually need to bake those textures.

311
00:14:53,979 --> 00:14:55,680
You can actually, instead of taking up texture space, you

312
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,981
could use GPU processing power to generate those motion

313
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:03,123
vectors at real time and then smoothly have at it, basically.

314
00:15:03,123 --> 00:15:08,185
So OK, that's how we've gotten around frame rate.

315
00:15:08,185 --> 00:15:11,466
What other strengths can we use for flipbooks?

316
00:15:12,898 --> 00:15:13,579
What about lighting?

317
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:15,460
I think one of the coolest notions

318
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:17,402
that I kind of realized a couple years ago

319
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:22,305
is that textures are actually just a way to transmit data.

320
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:26,708
If we take the flip book not as an emissive render

321
00:15:26,708 --> 00:15:28,109
and instead consider the way that it fits

322
00:15:28,109 --> 00:15:30,751
into a compositing pipeline, so a diffuse pass,

323
00:15:30,751 --> 00:15:32,892
a normal map, your alpha or density,

324
00:15:32,892 --> 00:15:34,353
maybe a temperature map, you know,

325
00:15:34,353 --> 00:15:35,854
take those passes that are actually used

326
00:15:35,854 --> 00:15:37,635
in compositing pipelines because our shader

327
00:15:37,635 --> 00:15:40,097
is nothing more than a real-time compositing pipeline,

328
00:15:40,097 --> 00:15:41,758
we can start to do some really, really cool things.

329
00:15:42,158 --> 00:15:45,280
So I want to throw out to a post that the Cloud Imperium guys

330
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:45,640
made.

331
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:46,921
Actually, Mike Snowden posted it,

332
00:15:46,921 --> 00:15:49,222
but it's a video made by Cloud Imperium in general.

333
00:15:49,222 --> 00:15:51,863
And it shows this incredible breakdown

334
00:15:51,863 --> 00:15:53,604
of 20 different really freaking rad concepts.

335
00:15:53,604 --> 00:15:55,065
One of them that I want to go over

336
00:15:55,065 --> 00:15:56,986
is just how they use data to pass into their lighting

337
00:15:56,986 --> 00:15:57,386
pipeline.

338
00:15:57,386 --> 00:15:59,387
So if we just take a flip book here.

339
00:15:59,387 --> 00:15:59,887
Should we try restarting?

340
00:16:03,166 --> 00:16:07,247
the trial talk over this. If we take an explosion texture again if we don't take

341
00:16:07,247 --> 00:16:10,188
the render the missive render but instead we actually render out and

342
00:16:10,188 --> 00:16:14,569
passes so let's say you render out your diffuse lighting. You render out your

343
00:16:14,569 --> 00:16:18,830
temperature and then you render out your alpha all 3 of those are probably not

344
00:16:18,830 --> 00:16:21,531
going to need color they're just masks which means you can put them into one

345
00:16:21,531 --> 00:16:24,572
texture because you've got your red green blue channels and then you can

346
00:16:24,572 --> 00:16:30,513
start to use that in interesting ways momentarily all show you guys how we

347
00:16:30,513 --> 00:16:31,793
approach normal mapping.

348
00:16:39,369 --> 00:16:40,472
Brutal.

349
00:16:40,472 --> 00:16:42,717
Well, okay, let's skip forward then.

350
00:16:42,717 --> 00:16:44,320
Imagine this was just an explosion playing

351
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:46,325
that just has the red is the alpha,

352
00:16:46,325 --> 00:16:48,410
the green is the temperature, and the blue is diffuse.

353
00:16:50,028 --> 00:16:52,949
what we can start to do as well for normal maps normal mapping of fluid is

354
00:16:52,949 --> 00:16:55,731
really hard right uh... you've got all kinds of different challenges

355
00:16:55,731 --> 00:16:58,892
the way that i like to do this is actually not it's not a correct normal

356
00:16:58,892 --> 00:17:01,774
up in a way it's it's kind of a bubble should render process but it works

357
00:17:01,774 --> 00:17:03,014
really really well

358
00:17:03,014 --> 00:17:05,295
uh... it takes advantage of the like my

359
00:17:05,295 --> 00:17:08,717
pre-rendered tools lighting uh... and light scatter so

360
00:17:08,717 --> 00:17:09,658
what i do is i render a uh...

361
00:17:11,898 --> 00:17:14,399
a light from the top and throw it in the green channel,

362
00:17:14,399 --> 00:17:17,359
and a light from the right and throw it in the red channel.

363
00:17:17,359 --> 00:17:19,060
And then I do the exact opposite

364
00:17:19,060 --> 00:17:21,420
with a secondary texture from the bottom and left.

365
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:24,841
And then what I can do is just using basic math,

366
00:17:24,841 --> 00:17:26,062
which you can't do in After Effects.

367
00:17:26,062 --> 00:17:27,822
You have to go to Nuke or write it yourself,

368
00:17:27,822 --> 00:17:29,923
like because you're going with negative numbers,

369
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:31,363
you need to be a little more complex about this.

370
00:17:31,363 --> 00:17:33,164
But the math itself is not hard.

371
00:17:33,164 --> 00:17:34,224
You can blend these.

372
00:17:34,224 --> 00:17:35,905
And then once they're blended,

373
00:17:35,905 --> 00:17:36,885
you can just compute the blue channel

374
00:17:36,885 --> 00:17:38,265
and you have a normal map.

375
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,526
I'm really hoping this video plays.

376
00:17:40,526 --> 00:17:40,806
Yes, okay.

377
00:17:42,458 --> 00:17:46,401
So this is nothing more than a diffuse render with an alpha

378
00:17:46,401 --> 00:17:47,501
and then that normal map created.

379
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:49,663
And you can see that I'm getting really freaking cool lighting.

380
00:17:49,663 --> 00:17:50,683
The shadows look really nice.

381
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,844
And that's because it's coming out of the render package.

382
00:17:52,844 --> 00:17:55,366
In this case, I'm pretty sure it was Houdini.

383
00:17:55,366 --> 00:17:58,267
So back to this video.

384
00:17:58,267 --> 00:17:59,168
How would I use temperature?

385
00:17:59,168 --> 00:18:01,950
I think a lot of you guys have heard of BlackBodies,

386
00:18:01,950 --> 00:18:04,691
or the BlackBody shader in Unreal.

387
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:07,573
It's basically running on the concept that, please play.

388
00:18:13,844 --> 00:18:18,005
no okay it's basically running on the concept that

389
00:18:18,005 --> 00:18:19,746
the input

390
00:18:19,746 --> 00:18:21,687
which means single channel

391
00:18:21,687 --> 00:18:24,808
uh... is going to derive color value if you think back to science in the

392
00:18:24,808 --> 00:18:28,269
kelvin scale like there's with with energy there's a certain color output

393
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:30,951
the black body is just a mathematical operation that when you drive

394
00:18:30,951 --> 00:18:34,712
a certain input of kelvin's gives you this beautiful color

395
00:18:34,712 --> 00:18:38,474
uh... it gives you really really nice explosions and you get that transition

396
00:18:38,474 --> 00:18:39,894
from fire into smoke accurately

397
00:18:39,894 --> 00:18:42,255
what we can also do is actually just use ramps

398
00:18:43,333 --> 00:18:47,234
So think of this like a lot where if I just take one single channel as an input

399
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:52,016
just a mask of of temperature

400
00:18:52,016 --> 00:18:56,258
that can drive my texture look up and give me

401
00:18:56,258 --> 00:18:59,419
really really cool

402
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,559
highlighted areas on the slope.

403
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:06,401
So that's just the temperature mask a single channel going into another texture which is a lot in this case.

404
00:19:06,401 --> 00:19:09,983
It's actually the top left texture.

405
00:19:14,150 --> 00:19:15,310
We also probably want to bloom it,

406
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:17,231
which is what the math on the left does.

407
00:19:17,231 --> 00:19:23,294
If we keep going with different lighting techniques,

408
00:19:23,294 --> 00:19:26,355
Matt Radford presented some really cool options

409
00:19:26,355 --> 00:19:27,055
for ray marching.

410
00:19:27,055 --> 00:19:28,356
I know there's a lot of research going on

411
00:19:28,356 --> 00:19:31,197
from a lot of great posts of different ways

412
00:19:31,197 --> 00:19:32,758
that you can use ray marching.

413
00:19:32,758 --> 00:19:35,399
I think there's even a really cool talk from Epic this week

414
00:19:35,399 --> 00:19:38,640
about fluids in 3D textures with ray marching,

415
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,201
so keep an eye on that.

416
00:19:41,298 --> 00:19:43,780
Remarching is a little bit more expensive,

417
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:45,080
but the results are astounding,

418
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:47,661
so I'm excited for us to keep exploring down this path.

419
00:19:47,661 --> 00:19:49,762
One of the other cool concepts that I've seen

420
00:19:49,762 --> 00:19:51,823
out of the Dice Guys for Battlefront

421
00:19:51,823 --> 00:19:53,984
with regards to lighting was this concept

422
00:19:53,984 --> 00:19:56,345
of a gnomon material, gnomon texture,

423
00:19:56,345 --> 00:19:59,026
where what they did is they actually took

424
00:19:59,026 --> 00:20:03,188
a pre-rendered cloud, or smoke, or whatever it is,

425
00:20:03,188 --> 00:20:07,169
and took those renders with really nice light scatter

426
00:20:07,169 --> 00:20:09,270
from Houdini, and just baked them all,

427
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:10,771
or compressed them all into a single texture.

428
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:17,018
And then using these 2 texture inputs just lurk between them at real time based

429
00:20:17,018 --> 00:20:17,598
off light direction.

430
00:20:17,598 --> 00:20:23,441
It's kind of hard to argue those results because you can take advantage of the

431
00:20:23,441 --> 00:20:26,363
full pre processing and all you're doing is just blending based off of direction.

432
00:20:26,363 --> 00:20:30,725
Let's keep going let's talk about some a vertex animation stuff.

433
00:20:30,725 --> 00:20:35,767
Norman a long time ago posted this really freaking cool.

434
00:20:35,767 --> 00:20:39,749
Like fluid sim basically working on real where he stored all the animation as a

435
00:20:39,749 --> 00:20:40,109
texture.

436
00:20:42,818 --> 00:20:44,900
I don't know how many of you guys are planning

437
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,521
on doing chocolate bars in your game.

438
00:20:46,521 --> 00:20:51,664
But this concept kind of sparked a lot of different interest

439
00:20:51,664 --> 00:20:54,866
and so we have people like Louis working at SideFX

440
00:20:54,866 --> 00:20:59,169
figuring out great pipelines for us to compress animations

441
00:20:59,169 --> 00:21:01,110
into textures to use on a particle.

442
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,072
In this case, the entire simulation here

443
00:21:04,072 --> 00:21:05,433
is a texture that's running.

444
00:21:05,433 --> 00:21:06,574
It's not an animation, it's not joints.

445
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:10,236
And that means that these can be playing on mesh particles

446
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,237
or individual particles.

447
00:21:13,436 --> 00:21:15,037
Here's a really cool fire sim that he did.

448
00:21:15,037 --> 00:21:17,298
Okay, so these are kind of abstract.

449
00:21:17,298 --> 00:21:19,160
Naughty Dog and a lot of other people

450
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,621
are actually using them for allowing us

451
00:21:20,621 --> 00:21:23,703
to finally do what we've always wanted to do with birds.

452
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,224
Actually have birds flapping their wings

453
00:21:26,224 --> 00:21:28,346
that aren't playing just a silly flip book, right?

454
00:21:28,346 --> 00:21:30,427
We can do full animations now.

455
00:21:30,427 --> 00:21:31,588
So how does this work?

456
00:21:31,588 --> 00:21:32,889
Well, if we go to math really quick

457
00:21:32,889 --> 00:21:36,071
and we consider just a position on this grid,

458
00:21:36,071 --> 00:21:36,791
that's my vertex.

459
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,476
it's not really handsome enough

460
00:21:40,476 --> 00:21:42,018
or friendly enough so uh... here's drew

461
00:21:42,018 --> 00:21:44,119
uh...

462
00:21:44,119 --> 00:21:48,322
now if drew were a vertex and you're moving around playing as animation

463
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:49,663
we kind of

464
00:21:49,663 --> 00:21:52,945
know what the outer bounds of this animation are going to be right

465
00:21:52,945 --> 00:21:55,808
so far out the box around this i know the max balance of this animation are

466
00:21:55,808 --> 00:21:56,028
ten

467
00:21:56,028 --> 00:22:00,131
and that means i can start to do cool math of this so let's say one frame in

468
00:22:00,131 --> 00:22:00,231
this

469
00:22:00,231 --> 00:22:03,473
uh... at this point it's uh... it's six annex

470
00:22:04,342 --> 00:22:04,904
and it's 4 and y.

471
00:22:04,904 --> 00:22:08,256
And the max bounds are 10, so if I divide by 10,

472
00:22:08,256 --> 00:22:09,159
then I get 0.6 and 0.4.

473
00:22:09,159 --> 00:22:10,744
If I normalize that.

474
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,501
I got a color value, right?

475
00:22:13,501 --> 00:22:15,961
Like I can actually bake this numerical data

476
00:22:15,961 --> 00:22:16,942
into a color and a texture.

477
00:22:16,942 --> 00:22:20,863
That means that I can actually build out an entire texture

478
00:22:20,863 --> 00:22:22,543
and play back a texture as an animation.

479
00:22:22,543 --> 00:22:24,984
So in this case, the vertex ID,

480
00:22:24,984 --> 00:22:28,485
each individual vertex gets a column on this texture,

481
00:22:28,485 --> 00:22:32,166
and time is simply the y-axis of this texture.

482
00:22:32,166 --> 00:22:34,666
So if we just play back this animation,

483
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:36,987
we can do things like goats as particles,

484
00:22:36,987 --> 00:22:37,567
or crowd sims.

485
00:22:41,115 --> 00:22:42,945
that don't need to be super detailed.

486
00:22:46,586 --> 00:22:50,507
right like fish birds, everything that we've always wanted to be able to play

487
00:22:50,507 --> 00:22:54,888
mesh animation on we can do this way. It comes with one caveat. This is a

488
00:22:54,888 --> 00:22:58,729
caveat that I naively ran into and I'm sure most people that explore down this

489
00:22:58,729 --> 00:23:02,510
path do and that's that if you're moving verts around at some point you're

490
00:23:02,510 --> 00:23:05,231
going to move it far enough that you need to reconsider where the normal is

491
00:23:05,231 --> 00:23:08,812
pointing and that complicates things. You probably have to pass another

492
00:23:08,812 --> 00:23:13,113
texture for your normals, but just as a general caveat. So what else can we do

493
00:23:13,113 --> 00:23:14,713
with these concepts of vertex animations?

494
00:23:15,634 --> 00:23:19,877
Again, the guys at Dice, man, they're coming up with some pretty freaking stellar solutions.

495
00:23:19,877 --> 00:23:23,459
So this is all a vertex animation playing on a single mesh particle.

496
00:23:23,459 --> 00:23:24,500
One.

497
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:27,102
One single particle.

498
00:23:27,102 --> 00:23:31,905
That particle looks like this.

499
00:23:31,905 --> 00:23:33,486
Or something similar.

500
00:23:33,486 --> 00:23:36,448
It's just a series of quads with

501
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:40,331
every single vert of a full quad having the exact same vertex color.

502
00:23:40,331 --> 00:23:43,493
And that means then that you can do...

503
00:23:44,278 --> 00:23:47,640
there's a term, Euler integrated equations on it.

504
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:49,741
Like deterministic math basically to say

505
00:23:49,741 --> 00:23:51,482
that this quad here moves in this way

506
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:53,243
and this quad over here moves in that way.

507
00:23:53,243 --> 00:23:55,865
You can bake all that out of Houdini and other badass tools

508
00:23:55,865 --> 00:23:57,746
and you can come up with some freaking

509
00:23:57,746 --> 00:24:00,267
amazing looking effects for really, really cheap

510
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:03,309
because it's all just one mesh particle.

511
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:04,950
Obviously you're limited on interactions,

512
00:24:04,950 --> 00:24:06,791
but as the core of an effect like explosions

513
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:08,832
that have this many sparks probably look pretty good.

514
00:24:08,832 --> 00:24:09,612
All right, let's talk about some trails.

515
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:18,788
I've seen a lot of really cool improvements in trail technology lately.

516
00:24:18,788 --> 00:24:22,670
One of my co-workers, one of my peers, Jay Hoon,

517
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:25,151
has been working with some really cool spline techniques.

518
00:24:25,151 --> 00:24:27,032
So this is just a standard spline.

519
00:24:27,032 --> 00:24:29,594
And what he wanted to see is, can we art direct this a little bit more?

520
00:24:29,594 --> 00:24:33,796
What would happen if instead of just the basic tangents of your spline,

521
00:24:33,796 --> 00:24:36,997
you actually gave yourself artistic control of the entire silhouette of the curve?

522
00:24:36,997 --> 00:24:40,779
And so he wrote this awesome tool

523
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:41,980
that just gives you a profile curve.

524
00:24:43,996 --> 00:24:44,816
that you can go in and shape.

525
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,137
Now in this case, it's geometry,

526
00:24:47,137 --> 00:24:49,938
because it was an easier example for me to record,

527
00:24:49,938 --> 00:24:52,659
but imagine this on particle trails,

528
00:24:52,659 --> 00:24:55,340
and actually being able to break up the silhouettes

529
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,440
and do really, I don't know,

530
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:00,421
artistically interesting effects out of trails for once.

531
00:25:00,421 --> 00:25:04,683
Bill Kladis has been doing a ton of really cool stuff

532
00:25:04,683 --> 00:25:07,564
with extruding custom profiles along geometry.

533
00:25:07,564 --> 00:25:11,725
These he actually kindly gave me out of his presentation,

534
00:25:11,725 --> 00:25:12,965
because he had to rip them, but.

535
00:25:13,999 --> 00:25:16,161
So you can see he's actually extruding a star shape

536
00:25:16,161 --> 00:25:17,963
or a human shape.

537
00:25:17,963 --> 00:25:27,673
And ending up with really, really, really cool end results.

538
00:25:27,673 --> 00:25:29,695
So that's my kind of swath of.

539
00:25:30,499 --> 00:25:34,302
interesting new techniques that are coming out of the visual effects community.

540
00:25:34,302 --> 00:25:36,303
I hope the takeaway from all that is just like

541
00:25:36,303 --> 00:25:41,567
share with us, go in there and learn from us because there's so many really freaking cool things that are popping up everywhere that

542
00:25:41,567 --> 00:25:43,869
the rest of the industry is adopting

543
00:25:43,869 --> 00:25:44,709
and

544
00:25:44,709 --> 00:25:47,411
progressing together with other companies, other artists.

545
00:25:47,411 --> 00:25:48,852
But the real reason

546
00:25:48,852 --> 00:25:55,237
I think this presentation is going to be cool is because I want to throw back to Drew who has

547
00:25:55,950 --> 00:25:58,833
Just a phenomenal perspective on the way our industry is changing.

548
00:25:58,833 --> 00:26:03,378
I remember the first time that I used Tilt Brush, where you put on the VR headset, and

549
00:26:03,378 --> 00:26:11,026
you pick up the controllers, and you realize that your hands and the space around you is

550
00:26:11,026 --> 00:26:11,227
a tool.

551
00:26:11,227 --> 00:26:15,051
And I think I spent about an hour just making something, and I remember feeling really sad

552
00:26:15,051 --> 00:26:16,753
when I took it off and realizing it doesn't exist.

553
00:26:18,754 --> 00:26:19,714
But it was such a liberating,

554
00:26:19,714 --> 00:26:22,115
like an artistically liberating experience for me.

555
00:26:22,115 --> 00:26:24,496
And so I want to throw this back to Drew

556
00:26:24,496 --> 00:26:28,638
to run through just his amazing retrospective on Tilt Brush.

557
00:26:28,638 --> 00:26:29,098
And take it away.

558
00:26:29,098 --> 00:26:29,798
Yeah, awesome.

559
00:26:29,798 --> 00:26:31,419
Man, thank you, Keith.

560
00:26:31,419 --> 00:26:34,680
That's the first time I've seen a lot of that stuff.

561
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:35,980
That's amazing.

562
00:26:38,958 --> 00:26:41,980
Yeah, it's the first time I've seen a lot of that stuff,

563
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,261
and I cannot wait to use it.

564
00:26:43,261 --> 00:26:45,383
I'm actually gonna bring it up in some,

565
00:26:45,383 --> 00:26:47,224
like, want to have some wishlist stuff

566
00:26:47,224 --> 00:26:48,545
coming in this section.

567
00:26:48,545 --> 00:26:50,467
But yeah, so a beautiful, beautiful,

568
00:26:50,467 --> 00:26:52,849
like, high-level view of all the amazing ways

569
00:26:52,849 --> 00:26:55,091
that everybody out here has been contributing

570
00:26:55,091 --> 00:26:56,892
and making all of our work great.

571
00:26:57,672 --> 00:27:00,373
I wanted to switch the lens, the kind of big picture.

572
00:27:00,373 --> 00:27:05,134
I wanted to focus it down on Tilt Brush as a case study.

573
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:08,574
So in this section, I wanna run through some more tricks

574
00:27:08,574 --> 00:27:10,655
that we use in Tilt Brush and really point out

575
00:27:10,655 --> 00:27:12,895
how all of the effects you just saw,

576
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:14,615
all the techniques you just saw,

577
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:18,916
are about to have like a much, much, much bigger audience.

578
00:27:18,916 --> 00:27:23,277
A lot of different fields, a lot of different places

579
00:27:23,277 --> 00:27:24,457
that these visual effects can go.

580
00:27:25,111 --> 00:27:28,494
Obviously for me, Tilt Brush is the biggest example of that.

581
00:27:28,494 --> 00:27:30,235
So if you're not familiar with Tilt Brush,

582
00:27:30,235 --> 00:27:33,437
it is a virtual reality painting application.

583
00:27:33,437 --> 00:27:34,698
It's built for the HTC Vive.

584
00:27:34,698 --> 00:27:37,781
You wear a VR headset, use controllers, paint in space.

585
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:40,102
I'll get into what I mean by paint in space.

586
00:27:40,102 --> 00:27:43,785
This is a prototype from our very first version back

587
00:27:43,785 --> 00:27:43,885
in 2015.

588
00:27:43,885 --> 00:27:48,429
It's a real fun, from the very beginning,

589
00:27:48,429 --> 00:27:49,449
it was a pretty fun project.

590
00:27:49,449 --> 00:27:51,211
This is how it looks now.

591
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:53,012
I'm going to play a little snippet of the video.

592
00:27:53,012 --> 00:27:54,333
Actually, maybe I'll just play the whole thing.

593
00:27:55,202 --> 00:27:57,183
How many of you have used Tilt Brush before?

594
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:58,583
Okay, awesome.

595
00:27:58,583 --> 00:27:59,624
And is anyone not, no?

596
00:27:59,624 --> 00:28:02,285
Is anyone unfamiliar with Tilt Brush?

597
00:28:02,285 --> 00:28:03,205
A few people, okay, cool.

598
00:28:03,205 --> 00:28:04,625
So I'll play this.

599
00:28:04,625 --> 00:28:06,626
It should have audio.

600
00:28:06,626 --> 00:28:11,688
I think, there we go, cool.

601
00:28:11,688 --> 00:28:11,868
So.

602
00:28:13,587 --> 00:28:18,588
Takeaway for this video is really just that painting in space, it can be anything.

603
00:28:18,588 --> 00:28:23,350
And starting Tilt Brush, that's really the project we wanted to take upon ourselves.

604
00:28:23,350 --> 00:28:27,771
What happens when you are in a virtual world, you can wave controllers around, and the paint

605
00:28:27,771 --> 00:28:30,252
you leave can be absolutely anything.

606
00:28:30,252 --> 00:28:36,034
Now I'm a visual effects by trade, and so for me, I think of what are the visual effects

607
00:28:36,034 --> 00:28:37,015
that you can make in the air.

608
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:40,496
And some of those visual effects are concrete, some of them are amorphous, some of them are

609
00:28:40,496 --> 00:28:41,036
particles.

610
00:28:43,397 --> 00:28:45,358
It's a pretty fun playground to explore.

611
00:28:45,358 --> 00:28:53,761
So everything that you saw in that trailer,

612
00:28:53,761 --> 00:28:57,783
or not everything, but a lot of it was really inspired

613
00:28:57,783 --> 00:28:59,023
by a GDC talk I did back in 2010 called

614
00:28:59,023 --> 00:29:02,144
Rock Show VFX, Bringing Brutal Legend to Life.

615
00:29:02,144 --> 00:29:05,526
This was back in, yeah, back in 2010 with Pete Demare.

616
00:29:06,530 --> 00:29:09,591
And back then, we were desperately looking

617
00:29:09,591 --> 00:29:10,952
for all of you guys.

618
00:29:10,952 --> 00:29:13,053
We didn't know where the community was.

619
00:29:13,053 --> 00:29:14,974
We were all just inventing wheels over and over again.

620
00:29:14,974 --> 00:29:16,375
It was a really frustrating time.

621
00:29:16,375 --> 00:29:18,836
And so putting this presentation together,

622
00:29:18,836 --> 00:29:22,478
I was really fascinated to see how many of those old school

623
00:29:22,478 --> 00:29:24,979
tricks apply in VR and apply in Tilt Brush.

624
00:29:24,979 --> 00:29:27,320
And one of my favorites is UV distortion.

625
00:29:27,320 --> 00:29:30,442
So this is a slide from that presentation.

626
00:29:30,442 --> 00:29:32,283
On the left, you have a fire that does not

627
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:34,124
have UV distortion enabled.

628
00:29:34,124 --> 00:29:35,124
And on the right, it is.

629
00:29:35,765 --> 00:29:39,188
If you're not familiar with it, UV distortion is a technique where you take one texture

630
00:29:39,188 --> 00:29:40,349
and you use that texture.

631
00:29:40,349 --> 00:29:44,093
You kind of animate that texture, you use it to distort the UV lookup of a second texture.

632
00:29:44,093 --> 00:29:45,635
Super simple technique.

633
00:29:45,635 --> 00:29:48,338
It's like old school bread and butter for us.

634
00:29:48,338 --> 00:29:51,581
And you take it outside of games and it has this whole new relevance.

635
00:29:52,295 --> 00:29:54,736
So, no surprise, in Tilt Brush,

636
00:29:54,736 --> 00:29:57,197
our fire is done using UV distortion.

637
00:29:57,197 --> 00:29:59,698
You lay ribbons of mesh down with the controller,

638
00:29:59,698 --> 00:30:03,079
and then we apply a relatively simple UV distortion shader

639
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:07,940
on top of it in order to create the illusion of fire.

640
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:08,780
I'm gonna have this shader,

641
00:30:08,780 --> 00:30:10,741
and actually most of the shaders I talk about

642
00:30:10,741 --> 00:30:11,821
at the end of this section,

643
00:30:11,821 --> 00:30:13,062
so I'll be giving those to you guys.

644
00:30:13,062 --> 00:30:15,342
Another piece I wanna call attention to

645
00:30:15,342 --> 00:30:17,323
is the embers that are coming off of that fire.

646
00:30:19,978 --> 00:30:22,182
Particles are super important to Tilt Brush.

647
00:30:22,182 --> 00:30:24,886
Like I said, when you can paint anything in space you want

648
00:30:24,886 --> 00:30:25,908
and you're a visual effects artist,

649
00:30:25,908 --> 00:30:27,671
a lot of that stuff ends up being particles.

650
00:30:28,533 --> 00:30:30,513
But there's a little bit of a catch,

651
00:30:30,513 --> 00:30:31,834
which is that in a creation tool,

652
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:33,534
you don't have a budget. Like in games,

653
00:30:33,534 --> 00:30:35,855
you're running around, you're a first-person shooter,

654
00:30:35,855 --> 00:30:38,776
you're running around a hallway, whatever, you know,

655
00:30:38,776 --> 00:30:41,677
you've got two milliseconds, you've got five milliseconds,

656
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,318
you've got some amount of time to work with.

657
00:30:44,318 --> 00:30:46,619
In Tilt Brush, there is no limit.

658
00:30:46,619 --> 00:30:48,999
You simply need to make every element

659
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:51,260
that renders as blazingly fast as possible,

660
00:30:51,260 --> 00:30:53,721
because our job is to get out of the way of the artist.

661
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:57,042
We do not want an artist to ever care about budgets,

662
00:30:57,042 --> 00:30:57,602
if we can help it.

663
00:30:59,983 --> 00:31:01,944
So we do that with stateless particles.

664
00:31:01,944 --> 00:31:03,304
And I threw some code up on the screen.

665
00:31:03,304 --> 00:31:05,005
This is a vertex shader.

666
00:31:05,005 --> 00:31:06,445
Your eyes can glaze over, it's fine.

667
00:31:06,445 --> 00:31:08,566
You don't need to pay attention to this.

668
00:31:08,566 --> 00:31:10,506
But what I do want to point out

669
00:31:10,506 --> 00:31:12,467
is the alpha channel of the color stream.

670
00:31:12,467 --> 00:31:15,068
So this is the only state that we're passing

671
00:31:15,068 --> 00:31:16,568
into our particles in Tilt Brush.

672
00:31:16,568 --> 00:31:20,029
We randomize each particle, we give it a random seed,

673
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,229
we send it down the alpha channel,

674
00:31:21,229 --> 00:31:23,050
and then we can do anything we want in the vertex shader.

675
00:31:24,220 --> 00:31:27,808
We also make extensive use of curl noise, which is another

676
00:31:27,808 --> 00:31:29,712
one of everyone's favorite tricks.

677
00:31:29,712 --> 00:31:32,718
This is also from the GDC presentation.

678
00:31:32,718 --> 00:31:35,543
And that, plus all of our basic.

679
00:31:35,772 --> 00:31:38,633
just a few sines, a few cosines, some other fun stuff,

680
00:31:38,633 --> 00:31:40,753
and you can start making really, really beautiful things.

681
00:31:40,753 --> 00:31:43,534
So this is an overview of some of the particles

682
00:31:43,534 --> 00:31:44,634
that are on Tilt Brush.

683
00:31:44,634 --> 00:31:46,215
This is snow.

684
00:31:46,215 --> 00:31:47,575
You paint the particles in space,

685
00:31:47,575 --> 00:31:49,316
but then we actually raise them up,

686
00:31:49,316 --> 00:31:51,316
we fade them in, we drop them down,

687
00:31:51,316 --> 00:31:53,637
we drift them back and forth with some sine and cosine,

688
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:55,557
and as they drop, we fade them back out

689
00:31:55,557 --> 00:31:56,717
and then warp them back to the top.

690
00:31:56,717 --> 00:31:58,598
So it's the illusion of a simulation,

691
00:31:58,598 --> 00:32:00,298
but there is zero simulation.

692
00:32:00,298 --> 00:32:01,699
It's entirely analytic.

693
00:32:01,699 --> 00:32:03,159
This thing just runs forward.

694
00:32:03,539 --> 00:32:06,541
Here we've got stars, which are a random atlas texture

695
00:32:06,541 --> 00:32:07,522
to get some different shapes.

696
00:32:07,522 --> 00:32:09,803
And then again, we just are flickering them

697
00:32:09,803 --> 00:32:12,685
differently with that random seed.

698
00:32:12,685 --> 00:32:14,186
Embers are the opposite of snow.

699
00:32:14,186 --> 00:32:16,288
So we start the particles at the bottom,

700
00:32:16,288 --> 00:32:18,049
we raise them off, we fade them out,

701
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:19,790
and then we warp them back to the bottom again.

702
00:32:20,838 --> 00:32:22,918
Smoke, this is pretty subtle,

703
00:32:22,918 --> 00:32:26,680
but you can see a little bit of a curl noise effect in there.

704
00:32:26,680 --> 00:32:27,440
Like I said, it's subtle,

705
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:30,060
so I'm gonna switch to bubbles, our bubble brush,

706
00:32:30,060 --> 00:32:32,341
which is a more dramatic example.

707
00:32:32,341 --> 00:32:33,962
Anyone in this room who's used curl noise

708
00:32:33,962 --> 00:32:36,002
looks at that and goes, ah, curl noise.

709
00:32:36,002 --> 00:32:39,643
This is not a brush that's in Tilt Brush.

710
00:32:39,643 --> 00:32:41,584
It's just a really fun experiment I did

711
00:32:41,584 --> 00:32:44,625
that kind of shows how far you can push stateless particles.

712
00:32:45,247 --> 00:32:47,448
Now, I got super excited with Keith's section

713
00:32:47,448 --> 00:32:51,531
because I hadn't yet thought of using a texture

714
00:32:51,531 --> 00:32:53,913
to drive my stateless particle animation.

715
00:32:53,913 --> 00:32:57,415
So maybe I'll put some birds and crowds

716
00:32:57,415 --> 00:32:58,056
till brush next.

717
00:32:58,056 --> 00:33:02,559
Switching from particles to more traditional geometry,

718
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:05,161
this is a fun breakdown of one of my favorite brushes,

719
00:33:05,161 --> 00:33:05,841
which is neon.

720
00:33:05,841 --> 00:33:09,524
This is just this kind of neon tube that you lay down,

721
00:33:09,524 --> 00:33:12,006
colored pulse racing down the interior.

722
00:33:14,465 --> 00:33:16,025
I wanna do a quick breakdown on this,

723
00:33:16,025 --> 00:33:18,127
especially for those who are a little bit newer

724
00:33:18,127 --> 00:33:20,468
to visual effects and who are curious about it.

725
00:33:20,468 --> 00:33:22,169
Again, you get the shader code,

726
00:33:22,169 --> 00:33:25,450
so don't worry too much about what's on the left there.

727
00:33:25,450 --> 00:33:28,352
But I do wanna just decompose these elements real quickly.

728
00:33:28,352 --> 00:33:32,114
So you've got a really simple physically-based material.

729
00:33:32,114 --> 00:33:34,135
You've got some specularity, some opacity.

730
00:33:34,135 --> 00:33:36,416
It's a little bit dim on the screen there.

731
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:39,197
But that's it, and then we're gonna add a animated,

732
00:33:39,197 --> 00:33:41,078
use animated UVs to send a ramp

733
00:33:41,078 --> 00:33:43,659
down the length of this thing.

734
00:33:43,659 --> 00:33:44,200
Super simple.

735
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:48,533
All brushes in Tilt Brush are driven by vertex color.

736
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:51,156
So the color for every brush comes from vertex colors.

737
00:33:51,156 --> 00:33:53,738
So the next thing I'm gonna do is pass in vertex colors

738
00:33:53,738 --> 00:33:56,801
so that we see the blue that is the actual color

739
00:33:56,801 --> 00:34:02,687
that was picked by the artist.

740
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:05,009
Spoiler, we joke that on Tilt Brush

741
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,270
everything is better with Bloom.

742
00:34:08,633 --> 00:34:10,995
We're gonna brighten that up, really make it nice,

743
00:34:10,995 --> 00:34:13,037
nice and neon looking.

744
00:34:13,037 --> 00:34:14,178
But here it looks a little bit,

745
00:34:14,178 --> 00:34:15,139
it's a little bit blown out.

746
00:34:15,139 --> 00:34:16,740
It doesn't have the characteristic look of neon

747
00:34:16,740 --> 00:34:19,482
that we want, and so we're gonna throw an edge alpha effect

748
00:34:19,482 --> 00:34:21,484
on top of this to really tone it down

749
00:34:21,484 --> 00:34:22,445
and make it feel more gaseous.

750
00:34:22,445 --> 00:34:26,348
Edge alpha, for those who aren't familiar with it,

751
00:34:26,348 --> 00:34:29,391
is you're using the facing direction of the normal

752
00:34:29,391 --> 00:34:32,193
to figure out, to basically modulate the look

753
00:34:32,193 --> 00:34:34,875
of your effect, in this case of the interior neon tube.

754
00:34:35,798 --> 00:34:37,179
So that's one of our simplest brushes.

755
00:34:37,179 --> 00:34:38,941
On the more complex end of the spectrum,

756
00:34:38,941 --> 00:34:41,483
we have our audio reactive brushes.

757
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,144
And again, all this shader code

758
00:34:43,144 --> 00:34:46,047
is gonna be available in a second.

759
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:48,829
So in Tilt Brush, you can play anything on your computer.

760
00:34:48,829 --> 00:34:50,791
You can play any music on your computer,

761
00:34:50,791 --> 00:34:53,434
and that music will be analyzed by Tilt Brush,

762
00:34:53,434 --> 00:34:55,455
uploaded to a whole bunch of shader constants,

763
00:34:55,455 --> 00:34:57,417
and then every brush that we have

764
00:34:57,417 --> 00:34:59,499
can use those attributes in different ways.

765
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:03,967
This was definitely one of the most fun aspects

766
00:35:03,967 --> 00:35:06,649
of Tilt Brush to work on over the last year.

767
00:35:06,649 --> 00:35:10,032
And going back to Keith's point about the community,

768
00:35:10,032 --> 00:35:14,696
I wanna have a huge shout out to Keijiro Takahashi,

769
00:35:14,696 --> 00:35:16,097
who is incredible.

770
00:35:16,097 --> 00:35:17,358
If you're not familiar with his work,

771
00:35:17,358 --> 00:35:19,520
you should go to his GitHub repo.

772
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,162
He's got so many amazing examples to learn from.

773
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,463
Reverse engineer his stuff

774
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:25,004
and you will be a better person for it.

775
00:35:25,985 --> 00:35:30,129
In particular, Reaction is a audio analysis library for Unity

776
00:35:30,129 --> 00:35:34,293
that we used to prototype the early versions of our audio reactive brushes.

777
00:35:34,293 --> 00:35:36,315
We've built heavily on top of it,

778
00:35:36,315 --> 00:35:40,079
but really his work was the inspiration, it was the seed,

779
00:35:40,079 --> 00:35:44,203
it was the way we could bootstrap our way into this really unusual place.

780
00:35:44,203 --> 00:35:46,465
So a massive thank you to Keijiro,

781
00:35:46,465 --> 00:35:49,288
and again, love this community for things like this.

782
00:35:50,804 --> 00:35:53,045
Now, looking at a simple waveform texture,

783
00:35:53,045 --> 00:35:55,926
I just wanted to show off some of our shader attributes

784
00:35:55,926 --> 00:35:58,147
that we have access to and describe

785
00:35:58,147 --> 00:36:00,307
how we achieve a really simple waveform effect.

786
00:36:00,307 --> 00:36:03,028
Spoiler, it's again just using UV distortion.

787
00:36:03,028 --> 00:36:05,889
So we have a procedural line that's totally flat,

788
00:36:05,889 --> 00:36:08,430
but then we're going to offset it using the audio waveform

789
00:36:08,430 --> 00:36:09,550
that we've analyzed on the way in.

790
00:36:10,295 --> 00:36:14,018
You can see that audio waveform is the kind of top rainbow texture there.

791
00:36:14,018 --> 00:36:17,761
And it's a rainbow texture because we do a bunch of different processing on the different channels.

792
00:36:17,761 --> 00:36:21,665
And we pass high pass, low pass, a bunch of other different modulations.

793
00:36:21,665 --> 00:36:26,789
We pack them all into this one-dimensional texture and then we use that to distort the UV lookup.

794
00:36:26,789 --> 00:36:29,031
We also have an FFT texture which we can use for fun things.

795
00:36:29,031 --> 00:36:34,016
And all those blue bars on the bottom are the shader constants that we additionally have access to.

796
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:43,581
Before I go into details on that,

797
00:36:43,581 --> 00:36:46,805
Kajiro also has an awesome GPU particle simulation.

798
00:36:46,805 --> 00:36:49,607
We brought it into Tilt Brush just because why not?

799
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,810
It's amazing, of course.

800
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:54,812
This most definitely is not stateless,

801
00:36:54,812 --> 00:36:56,174
and so for that reason,

802
00:36:56,174 --> 00:36:57,655
it's probably not gonna ship in Tilt Brush,

803
00:36:57,655 --> 00:36:58,596
but it's still beautiful.

804
00:36:58,596 --> 00:37:01,499
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful.

805
00:37:02,813 --> 00:37:05,114
So I keep talking about how I'm giving you guys these shaders.

806
00:37:05,114 --> 00:37:07,614
I'm giving them to you through the Tilt Brush Toolkit,

807
00:37:07,614 --> 00:37:10,395
which is a GitHub repo that we launched about a month ago.

808
00:37:10,395 --> 00:37:12,916
The Tilt Brush Toolkit has all of our shaders,

809
00:37:12,916 --> 00:37:14,877
with the exception of particles, those are coming,

810
00:37:14,877 --> 00:37:17,257
has all of our shaders, all our brushes.

811
00:37:17,257 --> 00:37:19,258
It's a toolkit to help you take Tilt Brush art

812
00:37:19,258 --> 00:37:21,919
and bring them into your own experiences.

813
00:37:21,919 --> 00:37:24,840
And yeah, so everything that I mentioned,

814
00:37:24,840 --> 00:37:26,880
you can find in here and reverse engineer it.

815
00:37:26,880 --> 00:37:29,261
In addition, my favorite part is all of the audio analysis

816
00:37:29,261 --> 00:37:30,962
stuff is in here, so you can just drop that

817
00:37:30,962 --> 00:37:32,342
into your projects and go nuts.

818
00:37:32,855 --> 00:37:35,296
I was kind of our way of trying to get back to the community a

819
00:37:35,296 --> 00:37:38,358
lot of this work was done by Fernando Ramos show.

820
00:37:38,358 --> 00:37:41,079
So thanks for Nando for giving back.

821
00:37:41,079 --> 00:37:45,922
And and that's a little bit of my experience on tilt brush

822
00:37:45,922 --> 00:37:49,664
pushing pushing visual effects outside of games and seeing

823
00:37:49,664 --> 00:37:53,266
how it applies in these new areas.

824
00:37:53,266 --> 00:37:57,268
Now I want to talk about the big picture more generally on

825
00:37:57,268 --> 00:38:00,510
top of the rise of real time I want to talk about beyond tilt

826
00:38:00,510 --> 00:38:01,711
brush beyond games.

827
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:04,353
where I see this stuff going.

828
00:38:04,353 --> 00:38:05,934
And I'm really, really excited about this.

829
00:38:05,934 --> 00:38:09,555
Simplest example I have to talk to you guys about

830
00:38:09,555 --> 00:38:12,497
is actually my badge, which is over there.

831
00:38:12,497 --> 00:38:12,797
Google?

832
00:38:12,797 --> 00:38:12,937
What?

833
00:38:12,937 --> 00:38:15,778
I've got Google on my badge?

834
00:38:15,778 --> 00:38:18,139
A few years ago, if you said I'd be up here

835
00:38:18,139 --> 00:38:21,081
with a badge that said Google, I would have done a double take.

836
00:38:22,061 --> 00:38:27,566
The big companies are recognizing the value of real-time rendering and are seeing the necessity for it

837
00:38:27,566 --> 00:38:31,990
And it's going to start tugging on everyone in this room and a lot of people outside of this room

838
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:36,695
If you look around you might spot badges that say Facebook might say Apple and might say Magic Leap

839
00:38:36,695 --> 00:38:40,939
There's a lot of eyes that are turning into our humble field

840
00:38:42,254 --> 00:38:44,316
And traditional real-time VFX, again, Keith

841
00:38:44,316 --> 00:38:44,996
touched on this a bit.

842
00:38:44,996 --> 00:38:46,277
This is where we came from, right?

843
00:38:46,277 --> 00:38:49,680
Consoles, PCs, smartphones more recently.

844
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:53,743
This is the primordial ooze that we were all birthed from.

845
00:38:55,021 --> 00:38:58,142
But the future looks a lot different.

846
00:38:58,142 --> 00:39:00,864
We're still gonna have incredibly high-end consoles

847
00:39:00,864 --> 00:39:02,685
and PCs, those aren't going anywhere.

848
00:39:02,685 --> 00:39:03,846
Smartphones are sticking around,

849
00:39:03,846 --> 00:39:05,107
but they're getting more powerful

850
00:39:05,107 --> 00:39:07,268
and they're getting ridiculous sensors slapped

851
00:39:07,268 --> 00:39:09,509
on top of them, like this is a Tango phone.

852
00:39:09,509 --> 00:39:10,930
So imagine a world where every phone

853
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:12,691
in your pocket has a depth sensor.

854
00:39:12,691 --> 00:39:14,792
It's gonna get real crazy.

855
00:39:14,792 --> 00:39:18,755
Mobile VR is growing up very quickly.

856
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:19,995
Right now we have mostly.

857
00:39:20,235 --> 00:39:22,396
headsets that only have rotational tracking,

858
00:39:22,396 --> 00:39:23,857
but soon they're gonna have positional

859
00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:27,139
and rotational tracking for true VR experiences.

860
00:39:27,139 --> 00:39:30,240
Desktop VR, the kind of premium VR experiences,

861
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:31,160
those are going untethered,

862
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:34,242
and so I don't know what that's gonna be like exactly,

863
00:39:34,242 --> 00:39:36,243
but I can't wait to try my first

864
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:38,324
untethered desktop VR experience.

865
00:39:38,324 --> 00:39:41,205
Augmented reality is on the horizon too.

866
00:39:41,205 --> 00:39:42,385
It's a little bit hazier.

867
00:39:42,385 --> 00:39:45,407
It's a little bit unclear when that's gonna land,

868
00:39:45,407 --> 00:39:47,448
but when it does, that's gonna affect all of us.

869
00:39:48,728 --> 00:39:52,332
Okay, so that's some of the exciting hardware

870
00:39:52,332 --> 00:39:53,954
that's coming our way.

871
00:39:53,954 --> 00:39:55,777
But what really matters to the people in this room,

872
00:39:55,777 --> 00:39:56,898
and the reason we're here,

873
00:39:56,898 --> 00:39:58,941
is what we can build with that hardware.

874
00:39:58,941 --> 00:40:01,444
So now I wanna rapidly run through

875
00:40:01,444 --> 00:40:04,247
really where real-time VFX can go beyond games,

876
00:40:04,247 --> 00:40:06,310
starting with creation applications.

877
00:40:07,060 --> 00:40:12,043
So no surprise, Tilt Brush is a creation application.

878
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:14,705
We see tremendous potential in this area.

879
00:40:14,705 --> 00:40:16,186
It's near and dear to my heart.

880
00:40:16,186 --> 00:40:19,008
But I want to pause for a moment and talk about how the

881
00:40:19,008 --> 00:40:20,769
visual effects community is already

882
00:40:20,769 --> 00:40:23,310
impacting all of these areas.

883
00:40:23,310 --> 00:40:26,112
So Tilt Brush, our team is composed of a couple visual

884
00:40:26,112 --> 00:40:27,793
effects artists from games.

885
00:40:27,793 --> 00:40:30,254
But we also have a lot of people from film, from Pixar

886
00:40:30,254 --> 00:40:30,995
and from ILM.

887
00:40:32,566 --> 00:40:37,610
Quill is a beautiful, absolute gorgeous application

888
00:40:37,610 --> 00:40:40,072
made by Inigo Quiles.

889
00:40:40,072 --> 00:40:42,914
Inigo, I'm sorry, I probably just butchered your last name.

890
00:40:42,914 --> 00:40:45,576
But if you guys don't know who Inigo is, he's a legend.

891
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:48,018
He pretty much lives and breathes real-time rendering.

892
00:40:48,018 --> 00:40:49,319
He co-created Shader Toy.

893
00:40:49,319 --> 00:40:50,761
If you're not familiar with Shader Toy,

894
00:40:50,761 --> 00:40:52,062
you should absolutely check it out.

895
00:40:52,842 --> 00:40:55,865
Another gorgeous application is Medium.

896
00:40:55,865 --> 00:40:58,367
That's created by a visual effects artist from games

897
00:40:58,367 --> 00:41:00,168
and an engineer from games.

898
00:41:00,168 --> 00:41:02,770
Those guys have done absolutely incredible work.

899
00:41:02,770 --> 00:41:03,911
And a huge shout out.

900
00:41:03,911 --> 00:41:05,952
I think they were one of the first teams, if not

901
00:41:05,952 --> 00:41:08,755
the first team, to recognize the potential for creation

902
00:41:08,755 --> 00:41:10,416
experiences on these new platforms.

903
00:41:10,416 --> 00:41:13,738
I want to move along, but other applications

904
00:41:13,738 --> 00:41:16,000
that are up here on this page also have roots in VFX.

905
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,281
I think that's so cool.

906
00:41:17,281 --> 00:41:19,243
This is Google Earth.

907
00:41:21,065 --> 00:41:24,467
just showing the potential for the impact of these tools

908
00:41:24,467 --> 00:41:27,810
on education, data visualization, science,

909
00:41:27,810 --> 00:41:29,170
simulation.

910
00:41:29,170 --> 00:41:33,093
All this stuff is going to kind of slowly pull us away

911
00:41:33,093 --> 00:41:33,434
from games.

912
00:41:33,434 --> 00:41:35,135
And you can see that a lot of the problems that

913
00:41:35,135 --> 00:41:37,356
need to be solved for something like Google Earth

914
00:41:37,356 --> 00:41:39,218
are problems that we've been banging our heads

915
00:41:39,218 --> 00:41:40,338
against for a long time.

916
00:41:40,338 --> 00:41:41,759
Theme parks.

917
00:41:41,759 --> 00:41:43,801
This one was a surprise to me, but Disney

918
00:41:43,801 --> 00:41:45,302
has a huge investment in VR.

919
00:41:46,267 --> 00:41:50,271
The next time that you get on like Toad's Wild Ride,

920
00:41:50,271 --> 00:41:52,433
you might be handed a headset and maybe it'll be VR,

921
00:41:52,433 --> 00:41:54,875
maybe it'll be AR, maybe it'll be mixed reality, who knows,

922
00:41:54,875 --> 00:41:57,859
but a lot of theme parks are turning their attention

923
00:41:57,859 --> 00:41:58,399
to this one.

924
00:41:59,310 --> 00:42:00,370
Mixed reality I mentioned,

925
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,551
this is a little bit more subtle,

926
00:42:02,551 --> 00:42:04,372
but I'm really, really enthusiastic

927
00:42:04,372 --> 00:42:05,432
about what's happening here.

928
00:42:05,432 --> 00:42:07,073
This is Alchemy, shout out to Alchemy

929
00:42:07,073 --> 00:42:08,073
for putting this guy together.

930
00:42:08,073 --> 00:42:11,015
Mixed reality is where you take real world elements

931
00:42:11,015 --> 00:42:12,495
and you take real time rendered elements

932
00:42:12,495 --> 00:42:13,796
and you kind of mix them together

933
00:42:13,796 --> 00:42:16,177
and you use real time graphics

934
00:42:16,177 --> 00:42:17,197
and real time visual effects

935
00:42:17,197 --> 00:42:19,738
to feed back onto the video feed.

936
00:42:19,738 --> 00:42:22,300
This turns out to be one of the best ways

937
00:42:22,300 --> 00:42:23,840
of communicating and sharing

938
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:26,261
some of these virtual experiences with people.

939
00:42:26,918 --> 00:42:28,139
Super fun for us.

940
00:42:28,139 --> 00:42:29,020
Definitely.

941
00:42:29,020 --> 00:42:32,143
You guys will love playing with this stuff.

942
00:42:32,143 --> 00:42:32,923
Music videos.

943
00:42:32,923 --> 00:42:38,308
So back in the 80s, music videos were one of the driving

944
00:42:38,308 --> 00:42:41,270
forces behind the exploration of video.

945
00:42:41,270 --> 00:42:46,694
And no surprise, in the world of VR, music videos and VR

946
00:42:46,694 --> 00:42:49,377
music videos are actually yet another place where we're

947
00:42:49,377 --> 00:42:50,838
pushing the boundaries of what's possible.

948
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:54,055
This is Chocolate, which premiered at Sundance.

949
00:42:54,055 --> 00:42:58,178
It's a film by Tyler Hurd and his company Gentle Man Hands.

950
00:42:58,178 --> 00:43:01,000
Yeah, VR music videos, pushing boundaries.

951
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:07,225
I'll let the video speak for itself.

952
00:43:07,225 --> 00:43:08,766
Yeah.

953
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:09,687
Good times.

954
00:43:09,687 --> 00:43:11,628
It's good, it's very good times

955
00:43:11,628 --> 00:43:12,769
in the world of visual effects.

956
00:43:14,468 --> 00:43:18,569
Show It To Me is another film, another VR music video

957
00:43:18,569 --> 00:43:20,930
that is done by our amazing collaborators, Tipmouse.

958
00:43:20,930 --> 00:43:22,371
That's gonna premiere at South by Southwest.

959
00:43:22,371 --> 00:43:24,292
That's done entirely with the Tilt Brush Toolkit.

960
00:43:24,292 --> 00:43:25,832
So it's all Tilt Brush assets

961
00:43:25,832 --> 00:43:28,513
using the Tilt Brush audio reactive code.

962
00:43:28,513 --> 00:43:29,814
Can't wait for this one.

963
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:35,414
Another great example is how real-time visual effects

964
00:43:35,414 --> 00:43:36,434
is impacting film.

965
00:43:36,434 --> 00:43:40,555
So film, traditionally pre-rendered 2D content,

966
00:43:40,555 --> 00:43:42,575
but we're even seeing really, really cool ways

967
00:43:42,575 --> 00:43:44,516
where our work feeds back into these areas.

968
00:43:44,516 --> 00:43:49,156
On the left, you have Atom, which is a short film

969
00:43:49,156 --> 00:43:51,217
made in Unity and rendered entirely in real-time.

970
00:43:51,217 --> 00:43:53,457
On the right, Oculus Story Studio

971
00:43:53,457 --> 00:43:55,317
continues to do really groundbreaking work

972
00:43:55,317 --> 00:43:56,638
in virtual reality.

973
00:43:56,638 --> 00:43:58,318
They've been pushing the boundaries of Henry

974
00:43:58,318 --> 00:43:59,998
and with Dear Angelica, which you should definitely

975
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:01,398
check out Dear Angelica if you haven't.

976
00:44:03,342 --> 00:44:04,703
But this stuff isn't hypothetical.

977
00:44:04,703 --> 00:44:08,165
Like here at GDC on Wednesday, we have real-time rendering

978
00:44:08,165 --> 00:44:10,606
for feature film Rogue One, a case study.

979
00:44:10,606 --> 00:44:13,028
So this stuff is happening as we speak.

980
00:44:13,028 --> 00:44:15,689
Notice Natty Hoffman, one of the speakers there, yeah, he

981
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,730
wrote the book, Real-Time Rendering.

982
00:44:17,730 --> 00:44:21,192
So people care a lot about this stuff right now.

983
00:44:21,192 --> 00:44:26,615
But my favorite example is Pearl, which is a short film

984
00:44:26,615 --> 00:44:27,996
by Google Spotlight Stories.

985
00:44:27,996 --> 00:44:31,678
And it is the first VR Oscar-nominated short.

986
00:44:31,678 --> 00:44:32,979
Play a quick trailer of this.

987
00:44:34,173 --> 00:44:35,795
But what I really want to call your attention to

988
00:44:35,795 --> 00:44:39,178
is the fact that this is entirely rendered in real time.

989
00:44:39,178 --> 00:44:41,921
So this is the 2D film that was submitted

990
00:44:41,921 --> 00:44:44,104
and was nominated for an Oscar,

991
00:44:44,104 --> 00:44:46,887
but it was actually originally built in VR.

992
00:44:46,887 --> 00:44:50,491
So the Oscar is for the 2D version of the film,

993
00:44:50,491 --> 00:44:53,114
and they just happened to also have a VR version of the film.

994
00:44:55,515 --> 00:44:59,737
So this really speaks to the power of their real-time rendering engine and just the fact

995
00:44:59,737 --> 00:45:04,219
that people are becoming open to our medium in places like the Oscars.

996
00:45:04,219 --> 00:45:10,581
But the best part, the best part of this is that they, this is the director Patrick Osborne,

997
00:45:10,581 --> 00:45:13,462
this is him doing the cinematography for that film.

998
00:45:13,462 --> 00:45:18,164
So he actually used a smartphone to drive the virtual camera that then they edited and

999
00:45:18,164 --> 00:45:20,685
then cut and then put, you know, and then submitted for the Oscar.

1000
00:45:22,792 --> 00:45:24,813
So all those things, what they have in common

1001
00:45:24,813 --> 00:45:26,114
is really the Next Computing Platform.

1002
00:45:26,114 --> 00:45:28,035
That's a buzzword that you guys are probably

1003
00:45:28,035 --> 00:45:28,755
gonna be hearing a lot,

1004
00:45:28,755 --> 00:45:30,596
or are already potentially sick of hearing.

1005
00:45:30,596 --> 00:45:33,598
But it's the common thread across all

1006
00:45:33,598 --> 00:45:36,120
of the different experiences I just showed.

1007
00:45:36,120 --> 00:45:38,581
It's really driven by the need to influence anything.

1008
00:45:38,581 --> 00:45:42,364
It's driven by the need to look anywhere.

1009
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:45,165
You need to be able to have the computer understand

1010
00:45:45,165 --> 00:45:47,067
where your eyes are, where your head is,

1011
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:48,588
where your position is, and you need to update

1012
00:45:48,588 --> 00:45:50,869
all of those things at a blazingly fast frame rate.

1013
00:45:51,511 --> 00:45:52,412
It's going to be bumpy.

1014
00:45:52,412 --> 00:45:54,413
This is the new technology hype cycle,

1015
00:45:54,413 --> 00:45:58,016
which is worth pointing out, everyone just to be aware of.

1016
00:45:58,016 --> 00:46:00,338
Like, we've got all these new technologies coming our way,

1017
00:46:00,338 --> 00:46:02,480
which is really, really, really exciting.

1018
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:05,162
But some of them are going to go through this up and down.

1019
00:46:05,162 --> 00:46:07,184
You'll get people really, really excited.

1020
00:46:07,184 --> 00:46:08,805
They hit that peak of inflated expectations.

1021
00:46:08,805 --> 00:46:11,928
And then you go down in the trough of disillusionment

1022
00:46:11,928 --> 00:46:13,910
before you crawl back up.

1023
00:46:13,910 --> 00:46:15,611
And I don't really have a, I'm not

1024
00:46:15,611 --> 00:46:18,013
going to argue about where we are on this curve

1025
00:46:18,013 --> 00:46:18,954
with different technologies.

1026
00:46:18,954 --> 00:46:19,895
The point I want to make.

1027
00:46:20,258 --> 00:46:22,579
is that for us as visual effects artists,

1028
00:46:22,579 --> 00:46:24,340
it's smart to target lots of them

1029
00:46:24,340 --> 00:46:27,261
because that insulates us from the bumps and ups and downs.

1030
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:31,022
And this real-time rendering world is upon us,

1031
00:46:31,022 --> 00:46:32,603
so we can embrace it,

1032
00:46:32,603 --> 00:46:34,444
but you might be wary of just doubling down

1033
00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:36,004
on any single technology.

1034
00:46:36,004 --> 00:46:38,985
Okay, so recapping.

1035
00:46:38,985 --> 00:46:41,766
The one thing that Keith and I are hoping

1036
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:42,987
you take away from this talk

1037
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:45,148
is that real-time VFX is expanding beyond games.

1038
00:46:46,073 --> 00:46:48,253
It's never been easier to get started.

1039
00:46:48,253 --> 00:46:49,554
So let's build the future together.

1040
00:46:49,554 --> 00:46:50,234
And thanks.

1041
00:46:50,234 --> 00:47:02,837
And yeah, so before we take questions, real fast,

1042
00:47:02,837 --> 00:47:05,638
I want to take the opportunity to burn through just a few

1043
00:47:05,638 --> 00:47:06,798
thank yous for the boot camp.

1044
00:47:06,798 --> 00:47:08,358
These are the people making it happen.

1045
00:47:08,358 --> 00:47:10,779
These are the people to buy beer for.

1046
00:47:10,779 --> 00:47:14,260
Christina Wan, Jason Kieser, Keith Garrett.

1047
00:47:14,748 --> 00:47:15,628
Buy these guys beer.

1048
00:47:15,628 --> 00:47:16,608
They're the co-organizers.

1049
00:47:16,608 --> 00:47:17,229
They made it happen.

1050
00:47:17,229 --> 00:47:19,369
All of our speakers, thank you guys.

1051
00:47:19,369 --> 00:47:20,630
Thank you guys so much.

1052
00:47:20,630 --> 00:47:23,091
Megan Boondey coordinated things from the GDC side.

1053
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,651
David Johnson did the party that we're

1054
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:26,012
going to have Thursday night.

1055
00:47:26,012 --> 00:47:30,313
Matt Oztolay, the party that we're having tonight, spacing.

1056
00:47:30,313 --> 00:47:34,995
All of the volunteers out here, thanks you guys.

1057
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:36,675
Jeff Hanna, he does a TechArt boot camp.

1058
00:47:36,675 --> 00:47:38,296
He paved the way for us.

1059
00:47:38,296 --> 00:47:39,176
So say thank you to him.

1060
00:47:39,176 --> 00:47:42,377
And of course, buy yourselves a beer for being here.

1061
00:47:43,402 --> 00:47:46,244
On that note, if you guys have feedback,

1062
00:47:46,244 --> 00:47:48,546
please tell us in person, tell us on the forums,

1063
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:52,049
fill out your reviews, be candid.

1064
00:47:52,049 --> 00:47:53,510
This is the first time we've ever done this,

1065
00:47:53,510 --> 00:47:55,371
and we have no idea what you guys want.

1066
00:47:55,371 --> 00:47:57,393
We're just trying to lay a stake in the ground

1067
00:47:57,393 --> 00:48:00,155
and say let's come together and let's build stuff,

1068
00:48:00,155 --> 00:48:01,256
and so next year, who knows what it'll be.

1069
00:48:02,309 --> 00:48:04,350
I want to add that it's for everybody.

1070
00:48:04,350 --> 00:48:06,631
If you buy this presentation, then this

1071
00:48:06,631 --> 00:48:08,552
community is going to grow.

1072
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:10,332
It's going to grow tremendously.

1073
00:48:10,332 --> 00:48:12,313
And that means that every single person in here is going

1074
00:48:12,313 --> 00:48:14,194
to influence the culture, which Keith pointed out.

1075
00:48:14,194 --> 00:48:16,315
So we want this to be for everyone.

1076
00:48:16,315 --> 00:48:17,715
We want it to be inclusive.

1077
00:48:17,715 --> 00:48:19,816
We want to take care of each other and just be friendly and

1078
00:48:19,816 --> 00:48:20,737
build an awesome environment.

1079
00:48:21,472 --> 00:48:24,653
On a letter notes, these are our parties.

1080
00:48:24,653 --> 00:48:28,576
Tonight at Jillian, 7.30 to 9.30, VFX Mixer on Thursday,

1081
00:48:28,576 --> 00:48:30,357
6.00 to 8.00 at St. Regis.

1082
00:48:30,357 --> 00:48:32,358
And now we've got a few minutes,

1083
00:48:32,358 --> 00:48:35,060
so we can take some questions.

1084
00:48:35,060 --> 00:48:36,040
Yeah, we did it.

1085
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:36,620
Yeah, we did it.

1086
00:48:36,620 --> 00:48:39,222
In spite of the PowerPoint ghosts.

1087
00:48:39,222 --> 00:48:40,082
That was 178 slides.

1088
00:48:40,082 --> 00:48:43,344
Questions?

1089
00:48:43,344 --> 00:48:43,965
I got one.

1090
00:48:46,433 --> 00:48:49,835
About the bird and the goat vertex animation,

1091
00:48:49,835 --> 00:48:53,117
are you still authoring that with like a rig

1092
00:48:53,117 --> 00:48:54,058
and then exporting it?

1093
00:48:54,058 --> 00:48:56,239
Yeah, so the pipeline, in that case,

1094
00:48:56,239 --> 00:48:58,480
those examples came from Naughty Dog.

1095
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,262
Where the pipeline is, they're still animating that goat

1096
00:49:01,262 --> 00:49:02,723
in their classic 3D package.

1097
00:49:02,723 --> 00:49:05,585
And then every single frame, you just compare

1098
00:49:05,585 --> 00:49:07,746
the difference of every single vertices position

1099
00:49:07,746 --> 00:49:09,307
versus its original bind post,

1100
00:49:09,307 --> 00:49:10,828
which is gonna be frame zero.

1101
00:49:10,828 --> 00:49:11,988
And you just store that difference

1102
00:49:11,988 --> 00:49:12,969
as a pixel on that texture.

1103
00:49:13,355 --> 00:49:15,477
So the engine renders it in like its old position

1104
00:49:15,477 --> 00:49:18,940
and then like the vertex tells it to move.

1105
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:19,561
Correct.

1106
00:49:19,561 --> 00:49:20,081
That's neat.

1107
00:49:20,081 --> 00:49:21,643
Yeah, so the mesh without that texture

1108
00:49:21,643 --> 00:49:23,324
is gonna be the goat staying in its bind pose.

1109
00:49:23,324 --> 00:49:25,126
And then as soon as you start playing the texture,

1110
00:49:25,126 --> 00:49:28,649
it's saying every single frame offset each vertice,

1111
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:30,011
here, here, et cetera.

1112
00:49:30,011 --> 00:49:32,573
That's why if you push it too far,

1113
00:49:32,573 --> 00:49:34,275
you have to start to consider the normals as well.

1114
00:49:34,275 --> 00:49:35,356
Yeah, that's cool.

1115
00:49:35,356 --> 00:49:37,297
It's a neat trick.

1116
00:49:37,297 --> 00:49:38,358
This is for Drew.

1117
00:49:38,624 --> 00:49:40,105
Thanks for your work on Tilt Brush.

1118
00:49:40,105 --> 00:49:41,466
It's an amazing tool.

1119
00:49:41,466 --> 00:49:42,087
Hey, thank you.

1120
00:49:42,087 --> 00:49:42,787
I agree.

1121
00:49:42,787 --> 00:49:44,908
As someone who's a traditional artist as well,

1122
00:49:44,908 --> 00:49:47,770
it's fantastic to be able to move off a plane

1123
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:48,271
and draw in 3D.

1124
00:49:48,271 --> 00:49:53,034
My question is, is there any hope for doing

1125
00:49:53,034 --> 00:49:55,856
like in-betweening in Tilt Brush, set up keyframes?

1126
00:49:55,856 --> 00:49:57,597
Yeah, that's a great question.

1127
00:49:57,597 --> 00:50:00,599
So the question is about in-betweening in Tilt Brush.

1128
00:50:00,599 --> 00:50:03,562
We haven't done in-betweening, but we have done

1129
00:50:03,562 --> 00:50:07,104
flipbook animation prototypes, really sequencing prototypes.

1130
00:50:07,683 --> 00:50:09,444
And they are incredible.

1131
00:50:09,444 --> 00:50:12,947
Like, I cannot believe how much fun it is and how quickly you

1132
00:50:12,947 --> 00:50:15,348
can create a sequence of three-dimensional drawings

1133
00:50:15,348 --> 00:50:17,169
that evolve together.

1134
00:50:17,169 --> 00:50:18,631
It's super, super fun.

1135
00:50:18,631 --> 00:50:19,991
We haven't tried in-betweening yet.

1136
00:50:19,991 --> 00:50:22,493
That would be probably the next prototype to try.

1137
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:23,734
But even without the in-betweening,

1138
00:50:23,734 --> 00:50:26,996
it is just mesmerizing to go frame, frame, frame, frame,

1139
00:50:26,996 --> 00:50:27,176
frame.

1140
00:50:27,176 --> 00:50:29,278
And you can do in five minutes, you can do ridiculous things.

1141
00:50:29,278 --> 00:50:32,060
I should caveat that with we have our hands

1142
00:50:32,060 --> 00:50:33,481
full with our current roadmap.

1143
00:50:33,481 --> 00:50:35,062
So that's not coming out anytime soon.

1144
00:50:35,062 --> 00:50:37,003
But it is something we're playing with.

1145
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:41,064
Thanks for the question.

1146
00:50:41,064 --> 00:50:43,366
Feel free to ask general things about the boot camp, if you

1147
00:50:43,366 --> 00:50:45,647
guys are curious about how it's unfolding.

1148
00:50:45,647 --> 00:50:48,350
If you want to ask Keith about Beyond Effects, which is a

1149
00:50:48,350 --> 00:50:53,074
pretty awesome example of the success you're having pushing

1150
00:50:53,074 --> 00:50:57,718
Beyond Games.

1151
00:50:57,718 --> 00:51:00,920
Or you can all go get beers right now.

1152
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:01,101
OK, cool.

1153
00:51:01,101 --> 00:51:02,802
Wait, we got one?

1154
00:51:05,085 --> 00:51:08,048
So since you asked about, I want to ask about Beyond Effects.

1155
00:51:08,048 --> 00:51:10,030
So what do you guys do in LA?

1156
00:51:10,030 --> 00:51:10,651
The plug.

1157
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:17,137
So for the past two years, so I stepped away from Naughty Dog

1158
00:51:17,137 --> 00:51:18,598
a couple years ago.

1159
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:20,140
And I was freelancing and just exploring.

1160
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:23,443
And I was realizing that every AAA company, game company,

1161
00:51:23,443 --> 00:51:25,245
needs help.

1162
00:51:25,645 --> 00:51:28,206
Right. I needed help and I thought we could never find enough effects artists.

1163
00:51:28,206 --> 00:51:33,088
We could never bring in contractors, even find remote freelance workers.

1164
00:51:33,088 --> 00:51:37,250
And then at the same time, I realized her Drew's discussion like

1165
00:51:37,250 --> 00:51:41,692
every theme park company, every film company, every single entertain.

1166
00:51:41,692 --> 00:51:42,753
Revlon has a VR studio.

1167
00:51:42,753 --> 00:51:44,833
Do you guys know that?

1168
00:51:45,397 --> 00:51:51,981
The Human Genome Project was trying to explore using VR as a way to synthesize and process

1169
00:51:51,981 --> 00:51:57,265
data so that humans can better represent it by walking around it and solve and find patterns

1170
00:51:57,265 --> 00:51:59,026
more easily by being in that space.

1171
00:51:59,026 --> 00:52:02,049
There's so many opportunities for visual effects artists out there.

1172
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,822
there aren't really that many companies

1173
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:06,663
that are trying to explore it.

1174
00:52:06,663 --> 00:52:09,886
And so what we're trying to do is see if we can

1175
00:52:09,886 --> 00:52:11,508
find a new business model that allows us

1176
00:52:11,508 --> 00:52:13,429
to help take advantage of those types of contracts,

1177
00:52:13,429 --> 00:52:15,651
to work with remote artists around the world,

1178
00:52:15,651 --> 00:52:17,373
to build secure pipelines so that artists

1179
00:52:17,373 --> 00:52:20,436
that are willing to moonlight, that are able to moonlight,

1180
00:52:20,436 --> 00:52:23,538
have an avenue to take on other cool, passionate projects

1181
00:52:23,538 --> 00:52:26,801
and just sort of inspire and drive more fun creation

1182
00:52:26,801 --> 00:52:28,423
into our industry.

1183
00:52:28,423 --> 00:52:30,525
So we're still early, we've actually opened our doors.

1184
00:52:31,272 --> 00:52:37,699
About six weeks ago, but it's all going well and there's just a ton of opportunity in front

1185
00:52:37,699 --> 00:52:40,622
of us to try to open up the business model of our industry.

1186
00:52:43,391 --> 00:52:45,933
Sorry for another question.

1187
00:52:45,933 --> 00:52:48,154
I've been doing traditional VFX forever.

1188
00:52:48,154 --> 00:52:50,956
I moved over to video games because something

1189
00:52:50,956 --> 00:52:54,598
I've always wanted to do was procedural visual VFX

1190
00:52:54,598 --> 00:52:57,981
or effects work so that every time you saw an effect,

1191
00:52:57,981 --> 00:52:59,922
it was something new and something different

1192
00:52:59,922 --> 00:53:02,383
that you could look at from any point of view.

1193
00:53:02,383 --> 00:53:06,366
Your presentation was fascinating.

1194
00:53:06,366 --> 00:53:09,808
Do y'all see like this sort of procedural approach

1195
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:10,489
to VFX in?

1196
00:53:11,329 --> 00:53:18,638
real time happening anytime soon.

1197
00:53:20,707 --> 00:53:23,847
The benefits of doing procedural work are astounding.

1198
00:53:23,847 --> 00:53:25,888
Where we're struggling is just that the tools suck.

1199
00:53:25,888 --> 00:53:28,208
It requires a very, very technical

1200
00:53:28,208 --> 00:53:31,629
and a very, very patient artist to learn how to use it.

1201
00:53:31,629 --> 00:53:33,869
And so I think one of the biggest things that I'm hoping

1202
00:53:33,869 --> 00:53:36,550
that the fact that we're having these discussions

1203
00:53:36,550 --> 00:53:38,451
that all of you guys out there are now thinking

1204
00:53:38,451 --> 00:53:40,131
because you asked that are now thinking

1205
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:41,751
what ways can we build better tools

1206
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:43,152
to help with procedural effects?

1207
00:53:43,152 --> 00:53:46,152
Like, I think there is gonna be a ripple movement forward

1208
00:53:46,152 --> 00:53:48,393
where we're gonna start to see artistic tools.

1209
00:53:49,279 --> 00:53:54,503
that allow us to create amazing procedural and technical,

1210
00:53:54,503 --> 00:53:55,863
like highly, highly technical effects

1211
00:53:55,863 --> 00:53:57,705
using the most artistic of workflows.

1212
00:53:57,705 --> 00:53:59,306
That's kind of a dream.

1213
00:53:59,306 --> 00:54:01,227
Houdini and in fact, Popcorn Effects

1214
00:54:01,227 --> 00:54:02,068
are pushing really hard

1215
00:54:02,068 --> 00:54:04,089
and they both have extremely technical workflows still,

1216
00:54:04,089 --> 00:54:05,450
but they're trying.

1217
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:06,891
Louis is doing a phenomenal job

1218
00:54:06,891 --> 00:54:08,912
with the side effects package

1219
00:54:08,912 --> 00:54:10,493
to try to expose the power of Houdini

1220
00:54:10,493 --> 00:54:12,434
into a more artistic workflow.

1221
00:54:12,434 --> 00:54:16,317
And I think that's only gonna benefit everybody.

1222
00:54:16,317 --> 00:54:17,197
So, yes is my answer.

1223
00:54:17,197 --> 00:54:18,558
Yeah.

1224
00:54:19,573 --> 00:54:23,974
Thanks for the talk guys with the almost standardization of

1225
00:54:23,974 --> 00:54:33,076
Engines and the amount of resources out there for people to get into effects. Do you see effects moving in the future towards?

1226
00:54:33,076 --> 00:54:35,696
As an artist being able to work remotely

1227
00:54:35,696 --> 00:54:41,837
Much more easier than you are now like say something like a concept or a character artist can work ease more easily remotely

1228
00:54:41,837 --> 00:54:46,618
Or do you think it will still be so integrated that studios will want in-house?

1229
00:54:46,618 --> 00:54:48,498
Preferably that's my dream

1230
00:54:49,057 --> 00:54:51,678
I think that's all of our dreams and I think that,

1231
00:54:51,678 --> 00:54:53,819
yeah, I think it benefits the studios tremendously

1232
00:54:53,819 --> 00:54:55,560
to standardize that workflow as well, right?

1233
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:58,881
Like we can't hire artists because it takes two months

1234
00:54:58,881 --> 00:54:59,982
for them to learn our tools.

1235
00:54:59,982 --> 00:55:02,383
Versus if we had standardized workflows

1236
00:55:02,383 --> 00:55:04,124
and Andreas here is...

1237
00:55:04,724 --> 00:55:08,067
bored for the next three weeks, I can hire him because he can just hop straight in and

1238
00:55:08,067 --> 00:55:12,972
make freaking amazing artwork and then carry on with his day.

1239
00:55:12,972 --> 00:55:17,115
So I think on both sides of that argument, there's a win-win.

1240
00:55:17,115 --> 00:55:19,437
And I think that's definitely the path we're all pushing for.

1241
00:55:19,437 --> 00:55:24,082
And actually, I think you mentioned this, but also Tyler Hurd, who did the music video,

1242
00:55:24,082 --> 00:55:25,783
mentioned it.

1243
00:55:25,783 --> 00:55:28,025
As these new areas grow up...

1244
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:31,201
There's also an awesome way to dip your toes into it.

1245
00:55:31,201 --> 00:55:33,161
Like the chocolate video, that was done,

1246
00:55:33,161 --> 00:55:35,922
he had help part-time from a visual effects artist

1247
00:55:35,922 --> 00:55:38,763
in the games industry, but it tends to skirt non-compete

1248
00:55:38,763 --> 00:55:39,863
because you're not doing games.

1249
00:55:39,863 --> 00:55:42,064
And so even if you're a company that traditionally

1250
00:55:42,064 --> 00:55:43,744
doesn't let you do other games work on the side,

1251
00:55:43,744 --> 00:55:46,445
some of the, like you're doing a VR music video,

1252
00:55:46,445 --> 00:55:49,025
that's not very threatening to Blizzard or to Riot, right?

1253
00:55:49,025 --> 00:55:51,146
So it's a good way of just kind of like

1254
00:55:51,146 --> 00:55:52,066
exploring what's out there.

1255
00:55:52,355 --> 00:55:55,298
And none of those other ventures have time to build their own tools.

1256
00:55:55,298 --> 00:55:57,921
So they're using Vanilla Unreal, they're using Vanilla Unity,

1257
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:00,504
and it's just like how fast can you hop in and make cool stuff.

1258
00:56:00,504 --> 00:56:02,005
It's very, very liberating.

1259
00:56:02,825 --> 00:56:05,748
Would you recommend that artists who don't have that limitation

1260
00:56:05,748 --> 00:56:07,530
with their studios, they're able to work outside,

1261
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,113
they should start trying to build some sort of freelance

1262
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:16,459
remote work base or be ready for when it moves that direction?

1263
00:56:16,459 --> 00:56:17,220
Absolutely, yeah.

1264
00:56:17,220 --> 00:56:19,742
I mean, everybody is searching right now for exactly that.

1265
00:56:19,742 --> 00:56:20,943
So if you can put yourself out there,

1266
00:56:20,943 --> 00:56:22,745
you're going to find a lot of really fun projects.

1267
00:56:22,745 --> 00:56:23,146
Cool.

1268
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:23,866
Thank you, guys.

1269
00:56:23,866 --> 00:56:24,807
Yeah, thanks so much.

1270
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:25,588
I'm just throwing a.

1271
00:56:26,888 --> 00:56:29,354
throwing the boot camp schedule up here.

1272
00:56:29,354 --> 00:56:29,815
Perfect.

1273
00:56:29,815 --> 00:56:30,557
And I think that's it.

1274
00:56:30,557 --> 00:56:31,018
Yeah, that's it.

1275
00:56:31,018 --> 00:56:34,406
So hey, thank you guys so much for coming,

1276
00:56:34,406 --> 00:56:35,950
joining us, kicking us off.

1277
00:56:35,950 --> 00:56:36,211
And.
