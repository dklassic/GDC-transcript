1
00:00:04,671 --> 00:00:08,513
OK, so welcome, everybody, and thank you for joining me

2
00:00:08,573 --> 00:00:12,336
for my talk, Virtual Insanity, Lessons Learned

3
00:00:12,376 --> 00:00:14,357
from Creating Virtual Reality Engine.

4
00:00:14,697 --> 00:00:15,478
So let's get started.

5
00:00:17,059 --> 00:00:19,400
So the agenda for today, I'm going

6
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,823
to take you through the horror engine, which is the technology

7
00:00:23,883 --> 00:00:25,284
that this talk's based on.

8
00:00:25,784 --> 00:00:28,646
So I'm going to be talking about what it is and what it does.

9
00:00:30,069 --> 00:00:31,650
And then the inspirations behind it,

10
00:00:31,850 --> 00:00:34,472
so the developers and the existing applications

11
00:00:34,912 --> 00:00:36,293
that informed its development.

12
00:00:38,234 --> 00:00:40,035
And then I'm gonna give a technical overview

13
00:00:40,435 --> 00:00:41,916
of the minimum viable product.

14
00:00:42,696 --> 00:00:46,418
So just underpinning the key functionality of what it does.

15
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:50,263
So then that should give a great background

16
00:00:50,864 --> 00:00:52,544
to the lessons learned.

17
00:00:53,324 --> 00:00:56,506
So I'm hoping that if you're here

18
00:00:56,566 --> 00:00:57,726
because you need to know more

19
00:00:58,186 --> 00:00:59,627
about creating your own technology,

20
00:01:00,367 --> 00:01:01,528
that you should at the very least,

21
00:01:01,688 --> 00:01:02,728
by the end of this talk,

22
00:01:02,828 --> 00:01:05,149
have the confidence to go away and get started.

23
00:01:05,169 --> 00:01:08,350
So, hello, yes.

24
00:01:08,911 --> 00:01:09,971
I'm Liz McCurrey.

25
00:01:10,371 --> 00:01:12,452
I love dinosaurs, first and foremost.

26
00:01:13,112 --> 00:01:15,793
And I'm an educational evangelist for Unity.

27
00:01:16,694 --> 00:01:17,114
But I'm.

28
00:01:19,472 --> 00:01:22,894
But I'm actually a super recent graduate too.

29
00:01:23,775 --> 00:01:26,497
So I graduated from a master's last year

30
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:28,339
in computer game software development.

31
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:31,321
So all the lessons that I'm sharing with you today

32
00:01:31,341 --> 00:01:32,983
are super fresh.

33
00:01:34,899 --> 00:01:36,380
And I'm also a Prince William Scholar,

34
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:39,241
so that's a partnership between BAFTA and Warner Brothers.

35
00:01:39,861 --> 00:01:42,422
So if you are wanting to continue into higher education

36
00:01:42,902 --> 00:01:44,002
in the entertainment industry,

37
00:01:44,142 --> 00:01:46,143
I'd definitely look at the initiatives they offer

38
00:01:46,243 --> 00:01:47,383
because for new talent,

39
00:01:48,003 --> 00:01:49,184
because it was a game changer for me.

40
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,865
So the horror engine, what is it?

41
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:58,367
So it was the focus on my research project of my master's.

42
00:01:59,267 --> 00:01:59,547
And it's...

43
00:02:00,973 --> 00:02:07,559
An overall concept, so it's a set of ideals for what would be a fully formed engine that we may all be familiar with

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:11,382
and it was informed by my research into

45
00:02:11,402 --> 00:02:18,188
virtual reality and horror and how the mechanics of virtual reality can really lend themselves to the horror genre.

46
00:02:20,150 --> 00:02:21,431
I like to define it as

47
00:02:22,812 --> 00:02:27,397
a prototype which shows the potential of social virtual reality

48
00:02:28,285 --> 00:02:30,866
through the use of an interactive social screen.

49
00:02:32,226 --> 00:02:34,767
So to add a little bit more color to that,

50
00:02:35,967 --> 00:02:39,268
I'll go through what inspired it, who and what inspired it.

51
00:02:42,049 --> 00:02:44,450
Unsurprisingly, virtual reality inspired it.

52
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:49,871
So last year was the consumer release of virtual reality.

53
00:02:50,191 --> 00:02:53,673
We finally welcomed it into our homes and it has us now.

54
00:02:56,127 --> 00:03:04,469
So we saw the commercial release of the PSVR for example, and the Vive, and we've also got mobile VR at our fingertips.

55
00:03:05,429 --> 00:03:13,532
So as this all became more commercially available, it also became more available to developers and educational institutions.

56
00:03:14,512 --> 00:03:19,293
And so with me starting my masters at the crest of this massive new wave of VR,

57
00:03:20,313 --> 00:03:24,556
There were so many amazing experiences being made,

58
00:03:24,956 --> 00:03:27,918
and not just in the games industry, but from TV,

59
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,221
and also educational and financial sectors.

60
00:03:32,721 --> 00:03:34,963
So there was a massive wealth of inspiration

61
00:03:35,903 --> 00:03:39,005
there being created for me to get to get grips with.

62
00:03:41,171 --> 00:03:48,835
As I did my research though, it was often said that virtual reality was a very isolating experience.

63
00:03:49,335 --> 00:03:53,477
So you're there in your headset and you're goofing around and doing whatever you're doing,

64
00:03:53,998 --> 00:03:57,139
and your friends can only kind of watch you and guess.

65
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:02,842
But we've seen with the commercial release of VR that this idea has been addressed.

66
00:04:03,563 --> 00:04:06,044
So, there's like the rec room for the Vive

67
00:04:06,484 --> 00:04:10,666
and the playroom VR for the PlayStation VR,

68
00:04:11,086 --> 00:04:12,926
which has addressed this more inclusive

69
00:04:12,966 --> 00:04:14,887
and social idea of virtual reality.

70
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:17,948
So when I was doing my research,

71
00:04:19,069 --> 00:04:20,850
the biggest area of inspiration

72
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:23,190
was a company called Triangular Pixels,

73
00:04:23,631 --> 00:04:24,611
that I don't know if you've heard of.

74
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,801
They did a talk last year too.

75
00:04:28,942 --> 00:04:33,105
And they used this idea of a social screen,

76
00:04:33,666 --> 00:04:36,147
which I think was a term coined by Sony.

77
00:04:36,908 --> 00:04:39,630
And so what this social screen does, as you can see here,

78
00:04:41,311 --> 00:04:42,952
if you have a player in virtual reality,

79
00:04:43,553 --> 00:04:45,334
the social screen gives you a window

80
00:04:45,494 --> 00:04:46,775
into that virtual reality world.

81
00:04:47,556 --> 00:04:48,997
So you can have access to information

82
00:04:49,037 --> 00:04:49,837
about what's going on.

83
00:04:50,698 --> 00:04:53,340
So this game here is called Smash Hit Blunder.

84
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:59,343
a plunder, and so you're sort of in a dungeon

85
00:04:59,443 --> 00:05:01,325
and you're going around collecting treasure

86
00:05:01,386 --> 00:05:02,927
and smashing things up in the process,

87
00:05:03,768 --> 00:05:07,053
and they found that by using this social screen

88
00:05:07,773 --> 00:05:11,318
and by giving information to the players outside of VR,

89
00:05:11,558 --> 00:05:12,760
that the players in VR

90
00:05:13,541 --> 00:05:20,474
may not be privy to, such as a timer or a leaderboard for example, it just really organically

91
00:05:20,594 --> 00:05:26,204
created a more inclusive virtual reality experience and I just found that concept super interesting.

92
00:05:28,459 --> 00:05:29,900
And then finally, horror.

93
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,461
So I could talk about horror forever,

94
00:05:32,541 --> 00:05:33,742
so I'm gonna stop myself right there.

95
00:05:34,342 --> 00:05:38,865
But I went around asking friends and other developers

96
00:05:38,945 --> 00:05:42,767
what scared them, because horror's super subjective

97
00:05:42,827 --> 00:05:43,848
and a lot of different things

98
00:05:44,268 --> 00:05:45,489
scare a lot of different people.

99
00:05:46,569 --> 00:05:50,171
But I spoke to Lizzie Atwood.

100
00:05:51,067 --> 00:05:54,788
And she told me that her company, Furious Bee,

101
00:05:54,848 --> 00:05:58,389
had created this little tech demo of what scared her.

102
00:05:58,409 --> 00:06:01,629
And so you were in a house,

103
00:06:02,190 --> 00:06:04,130
and you had an object in the house.

104
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:07,311
And every time you went looking at the object,

105
00:06:07,431 --> 00:06:09,291
and it was outside your field of view,

106
00:06:09,971 --> 00:06:11,171
its position updated,

107
00:06:11,632 --> 00:06:14,892
so it was kind of like you were being followed,

108
00:06:15,112 --> 00:06:16,753
like those creepy angels from Doctor Who.

109
00:06:17,913 --> 00:06:20,335
And I just absolutely loved that.

110
00:06:20,755 --> 00:06:23,457
And I thought, this is scaring her,

111
00:06:23,617 --> 00:06:26,520
and it would be so cool if I could be the one

112
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:29,042
that's placing that creepy angel and scaring her.

113
00:06:29,802 --> 00:06:33,925
And so that's really where the idea for the horror engine came to life.

114
00:06:35,507 --> 00:06:37,848
So going back to the original definition then.

115
00:06:39,009 --> 00:06:42,232
So it's a prototype, it's proof of concept

116
00:06:42,512 --> 00:06:45,294
for social and more inclusive virtual reality.

117
00:06:46,273 --> 00:06:48,494
through the use of an interactive social screen.

118
00:06:49,214 --> 00:06:51,535
So the idea that while one of you is in VR,

119
00:06:52,175 --> 00:06:54,076
another one of you on a separate machine

120
00:06:54,316 --> 00:06:56,637
can manipulate that world and place objects

121
00:06:57,137 --> 00:06:59,258
as an aim to scare your friends.

122
00:06:59,979 --> 00:07:01,299
Because I'm terrible at that.

123
00:07:02,540 --> 00:07:06,481
So why did I create it, other than the obvious?

124
00:07:07,042 --> 00:07:07,282
Well,

125
00:07:08,557 --> 00:07:14,699
As I said earlier, I started university at this peak of this amazing new wave.

126
00:07:15,539 --> 00:07:20,841
So virtual reality in itself isn't a new technology, but this new wave, this new iteration of it

127
00:07:20,961 --> 00:07:21,101
is.

128
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:24,042
It was just the perfect time to get involved.

129
00:07:25,343 --> 00:07:29,724
And as a developer, this newness of it really fascinated me.

130
00:07:30,604 --> 00:07:34,068
Which meant that I naturally wanted to get a better understanding of it.

131
00:07:34,809 --> 00:07:38,253
I was one of those kids that couldn't just have a radio,

132
00:07:38,273 --> 00:07:40,676
I had to take it apart and put it back together

133
00:07:40,696 --> 00:07:42,978
to understand why the radio was a radio.

134
00:07:42,998 --> 00:07:44,180
So, I could have...

135
00:07:46,774 --> 00:07:50,955
used existing plugins and an existing engine

136
00:07:51,075 --> 00:07:52,396
to create this experience.

137
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:54,217
But as a programming student,

138
00:07:54,297 --> 00:07:56,478
I really wanted to create that code myself.

139
00:07:56,618 --> 00:07:59,259
I wanted to write it myself, get an understanding of it,

140
00:08:00,199 --> 00:08:03,780
and not just take for granted and at face value

141
00:08:03,820 --> 00:08:05,481
what this plugin was telling me it did.

142
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,843
And I think as developers, it's super important

143
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:12,024
to understand more the technologies we're using every day

144
00:08:12,524 --> 00:08:13,664
so we're able to leverage it

145
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,425
and just make better experiences.

146
00:08:17,206 --> 00:08:18,746
And finally, giving back.

147
00:08:19,087 --> 00:08:22,128
So, yes, virtual reality is ever-evolving

148
00:08:22,168 --> 00:08:24,188
and we're finding out a lot of new developments,

149
00:08:24,848 --> 00:08:26,909
but actually our industry is like that as a whole.

150
00:08:27,349 --> 00:08:29,130
And I think it's really great

151
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:31,371
that anybody can contribute to that.

152
00:08:31,991 --> 00:08:33,351
And it's important to do so,

153
00:08:33,471 --> 00:08:36,412
to sort of keep the potential of what we're all making.

154
00:08:39,433 --> 00:08:42,454
So now, onto the technical overview

155
00:08:43,174 --> 00:08:45,355
of the minimum viable product, the MVP.

156
00:08:46,654 --> 00:08:53,579
So I set out with this big goal that by the end of my master's I'd have made this engine.

157
00:08:55,601 --> 00:09:02,005
But actually that doesn't just happen overnight or in a very short space of time.

158
00:09:02,986 --> 00:09:08,150
So what I did was I started off with the minimum viable product for what I wanted to create.

159
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,694
So this is like the minimum functionality that you need in order to validate what you're creating.

160
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:18,632
So I split this into three areas,

161
00:09:19,372 --> 00:09:21,233
which was the virtual reality integration,

162
00:09:21,493 --> 00:09:23,633
the networking, and the rendering.

163
00:09:24,514 --> 00:09:27,494
So this is what it built up to be.

164
00:09:28,555 --> 00:09:30,615
So everything was built from the ground up

165
00:09:30,855 --> 00:09:34,016
in C++ libraries using the Visual Studio's

166
00:09:34,096 --> 00:09:36,557
integrated development environment, the IDE.

167
00:09:38,137 --> 00:09:39,898
For the rendering, I used DirectX 11.

168
00:09:42,084 --> 00:09:47,788
For virtuality integration, I use the C++ SDK from Oculus.

169
00:09:49,250 --> 00:09:52,352
I use Windows Sockets libraries for networking, so

170
00:09:52,392 --> 00:09:54,373
the communication between two machines.

171
00:09:55,214 --> 00:09:58,457
And I use direct input for player movement.

172
00:10:00,578 --> 00:10:02,940
So let's just take a little moment.

173
00:10:05,361 --> 00:10:11,863
to consider what this minimum viable product is compared to what I overall wanted to create.

174
00:10:13,303 --> 00:10:16,004
So you'll see straight away that it's missing quite a bit.

175
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:20,426
There's nothing, for example, for collision or audio.

176
00:10:21,346 --> 00:10:23,687
And you'll also see that everything is set in stone.

177
00:10:24,607 --> 00:10:29,168
So there's no abstraction, for example, to allow for the integration of another virtual

178
00:10:29,188 --> 00:10:31,169
reality headset or rendering API.

179
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,741
And also setting in stone like this

180
00:10:35,582 --> 00:10:37,183
really limits the release platform.

181
00:10:37,963 --> 00:10:39,404
So there's all these considerations

182
00:10:39,565 --> 00:10:44,248
that you would take for granted having used an engine.

183
00:10:46,569 --> 00:10:49,691
So the MVP then, the minimum viable product,

184
00:10:50,111 --> 00:10:54,254
is the minimum functionality before concerning itself

185
00:10:54,374 --> 00:10:56,336
with all the outer intricacies

186
00:10:56,736 --> 00:10:58,257
that you're going to have to consider

187
00:10:58,297 --> 00:10:59,578
when you make your final project.

188
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:08,581
And just a word of advice that I learned from doing it this way

189
00:11:08,661 --> 00:11:12,485
rather than using plugins is that when you use a plugin,

190
00:11:13,385 --> 00:11:16,529
more often than not, the person who's created it

191
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,493
has an appreciation of the pipelines of the engine

192
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,214
that you're going to integrate it into.

193
00:11:23,545 --> 00:11:26,931
So sometimes you don't have to alter too much

194
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:29,195
what you already have to be able to accommodate it

195
00:11:29,435 --> 00:11:32,380
or get it to work how you would expect or you want it to.

196
00:11:33,539 --> 00:11:37,102
Whereas if you build up a product in this way,

197
00:11:37,542 --> 00:11:39,464
you really have to have a deep understanding

198
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:40,445
of what you're using.

199
00:11:41,225 --> 00:11:45,388
So just because the Oculus SDK supports DirectX 11,

200
00:11:46,469 --> 00:11:50,092
just by integrating and referencing that

201
00:11:50,512 --> 00:11:53,034
in your existing DirectX 11 project

202
00:11:53,595 --> 00:11:56,257
means it's gonna work as expected or at all.

203
00:11:56,797 --> 00:12:00,180
There's a process of identifying the code that you need

204
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:02,842
and integrating that together appropriately.

205
00:12:05,022 --> 00:12:08,003
And so the minimum variable product as a concept

206
00:12:08,023 --> 00:12:10,424
looked like this.

207
00:12:10,444 --> 00:12:14,686
So on one machine, the product would load

208
00:12:15,927 --> 00:12:18,008
as a virtual reality experience.

209
00:12:18,348 --> 00:12:23,210
So this is where the SDK was used, Oculus SDK.

210
00:12:24,591 --> 00:12:25,791
And then on the mother machine,

211
00:12:25,831 --> 00:12:27,612
you would have this interactive social screen.

212
00:12:28,412 --> 00:12:32,454
So the player on this machine could use the grid system

213
00:12:32,754 --> 00:12:34,135
to be able to place the objects.

214
00:12:35,276 --> 00:12:40,524
and the network libraries were used to facilitate this data transfer between the two machines.

215
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,441
So while the player with the interactive social screen

216
00:12:44,561 --> 00:12:47,363
could place the object and it would send the geometry type

217
00:12:47,403 --> 00:12:49,944
and position to the VR machine,

218
00:12:49,984 --> 00:12:51,565
which would manifest it in the VR world,

219
00:12:52,245 --> 00:12:54,066
the VR world was always sending back

220
00:12:54,146 --> 00:12:55,947
the position of the player in VR

221
00:12:56,508 --> 00:12:58,149
so that the player with the social screen

222
00:12:58,209 --> 00:13:00,270
could more strategically place those scares.

223
00:13:00,970 --> 00:13:03,792
And you'll see there's a Twin Peaks

224
00:13:03,852 --> 00:13:05,873
kind of aesthetic going on, that's my doing.

225
00:13:07,554 --> 00:13:10,075
So in reality, it looked like this.

226
00:13:10,335 --> 00:13:13,697
So this was the first time that I showed it to anybody,

227
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:14,117
actually.

228
00:13:14,137 --> 00:13:16,999
So you can see the two-way machine communication

229
00:13:17,019 --> 00:13:19,900
that I've talked about, the DK2 there.

230
00:13:21,341 --> 00:13:24,303
And then the picture on the left was some concept art

231
00:13:24,323 --> 00:13:27,004
done by my friend whose concept art is called Bradley.

232
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:31,818
and he mocked up a number of scenarios for what the MVP could be

233
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:34,660
the mechanics of it could be used for

234
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:38,663
so he came up with the idea of a detective game where

235
00:13:39,063 --> 00:13:42,146
you could place clues and move the clues and that kind of thing

236
00:13:42,166 --> 00:13:48,150
so it was really cool

237
00:13:48,170 --> 00:13:48,210
so

238
00:13:48,951 --> 00:13:50,592
this is the reason you're all here

239
00:13:50,612 --> 00:13:52,934
so the lessons learned

240
00:13:56,383 --> 00:13:59,547
I learned a lot doing this, some good, some bad.

241
00:14:00,849 --> 00:14:02,951
And so what I've done is I've taken all that

242
00:14:03,011 --> 00:14:04,513
and I've tried to condense them down

243
00:14:04,573 --> 00:14:07,117
into what I think were the key important parts.

244
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:10,489
that I'm hoping will be useful to some of you.

245
00:14:11,209 --> 00:14:12,770
So I've split them into three areas.

246
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:15,471
So one is pre-development,

247
00:14:15,871 --> 00:14:18,212
so things to consider before you even get started.

248
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:22,113
Then development is early on in development

249
00:14:22,273 --> 00:14:23,374
and iteratively throughout.

250
00:14:24,114 --> 00:14:27,275
And then finally, just more personal lessons learned

251
00:14:27,495 --> 00:14:31,116
about just being a developer and looking after yourself.

252
00:14:32,884 --> 00:14:35,866
And all these are going to sound really obvious as well,

253
00:14:36,246 --> 00:14:38,908
but actually when you get into that development headspace,

254
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:40,309
they quickly go out the window.

255
00:14:41,089 --> 00:14:42,450
So it's worth remembering them.

256
00:14:43,271 --> 00:14:45,393
So clear goals.

257
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:47,014
Yes, they sound obvious.

258
00:14:47,374 --> 00:14:49,295
What do you want what you're creating to do?

259
00:14:50,336 --> 00:14:52,478
But actually it goes beyond that,

260
00:14:52,898 --> 00:14:55,380
and it's about what you want to achieve from it too.

261
00:14:56,340 --> 00:14:58,501
So is there something that you want to collaborate to,

262
00:14:58,601 --> 00:14:59,942
or something that you want to learn?

263
00:15:01,263 --> 00:15:04,785
So for me, yes, it was an academic project.

264
00:15:05,945 --> 00:15:09,768
And I wanted to create this multiplayer virtuality

265
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:10,468
experience.

266
00:15:11,229 --> 00:15:12,829
That's what I wanted the technology to do.

267
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:15,991
But what I wanted personally was the ability

268
00:15:16,091 --> 00:15:19,233
to learn more fundamentally how virtual reality code worked.

269
00:15:22,901 --> 00:15:26,083
So then that leads quite naturally onto resource.

270
00:15:26,183 --> 00:15:28,045
So you've identified what you want to do,

271
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:30,486
but now you need to think about how you're going to do it.

272
00:15:31,767 --> 00:15:34,449
And there'll often be things that you forget.

273
00:15:35,270 --> 00:15:36,691
So if you're not at university,

274
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,672
you need to sort of think about the software

275
00:15:38,692 --> 00:15:39,873
and also the licenses,

276
00:15:40,213 --> 00:15:41,794
and not just the development software.

277
00:15:41,854 --> 00:15:43,576
Is there anything that you need outside of that?

278
00:15:44,602 --> 00:15:48,304
There's also the consideration that if you're using virtual reality,

279
00:15:48,324 --> 00:15:52,066
you're going to have to think about what headsets you have available,

280
00:15:52,726 --> 00:15:55,608
but also the hardware to be able to run those headsets.

281
00:15:56,248 --> 00:15:58,809
So for me, my machine at home didn't suffice,

282
00:15:58,930 --> 00:16:01,731
and I had to make sure I was in the computer labs at university

283
00:16:01,931 --> 00:16:03,952
all the time to be able to support the Oculus.

284
00:16:05,349 --> 00:16:10,892
And this also extends to any research journals or articles.

285
00:16:11,552 --> 00:16:14,474
Because if you're working in something fairly new,

286
00:16:14,494 --> 00:16:17,615
there might not be the resource that you are used to having

287
00:16:17,715 --> 00:16:20,077
if you use an established engine, for example.

288
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:23,358
And what do you already know?

289
00:16:23,939 --> 00:16:26,420
Because I think it's really important to, at this point,

290
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,341
to address your strengths and play to them.

291
00:16:29,793 --> 00:16:32,814
So for example, I'd already had experience

292
00:16:33,074 --> 00:16:34,574
with networking and rendering,

293
00:16:35,194 --> 00:16:38,095
so that allowed me to more fully apply myself

294
00:16:38,155 --> 00:16:39,875
to learning those virtual reality elements.

295
00:16:40,235 --> 00:16:42,056
So if you have a project that you already have

296
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:43,296
that you're wanting to build on,

297
00:16:43,716 --> 00:16:45,556
or a strength that you really want to play to,

298
00:16:46,016 --> 00:16:47,997
it's a good idea to get started that way.

299
00:16:48,017 --> 00:16:52,578
Oh, have I gone backwards?

300
00:16:53,578 --> 00:16:54,518
How do I go forwards?

301
00:16:55,058 --> 00:16:56,398
Oh no, am I spoiling it?

302
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,172
Don't worry, roll with it, roll with it.

303
00:17:01,572 --> 00:17:04,455
So, research.

304
00:17:05,256 --> 00:17:08,760
So this is gonna start very early on in your project,

305
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,922
but it's gonna carry on iteratively throughout.

306
00:17:10,962 --> 00:17:13,865
And so, this is adding color to what you're creating.

307
00:17:14,789 --> 00:17:18,612
So the inspirations part of this talk was my research.

308
00:17:19,212 --> 00:17:22,335
It was existing products, existing processes,

309
00:17:22,695 --> 00:17:25,277
and developers that inspired what I was creating.

310
00:17:26,038 --> 00:17:29,401
And this also went into research journals

311
00:17:29,441 --> 00:17:31,462
and articles as well.

312
00:17:34,144 --> 00:17:38,948
And then starting small again seems obvious,

313
00:17:39,509 --> 00:17:42,011
but this is why I took this overall concept

314
00:17:42,111 --> 00:17:44,193
and started off with the minimum viable product.

315
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:47,681
What I did then when I had the minimum viable product

316
00:17:48,241 --> 00:17:50,544
is I broke each concept down further.

317
00:17:51,265 --> 00:17:53,729
So for each of those elements, I broke it down

318
00:17:53,849 --> 00:17:56,652
until I couldn't break it down any further.

319
00:17:56,672 --> 00:17:59,156
And this sounds mental, because I would

320
00:17:59,196 --> 00:18:01,018
have a million tasks to do.

321
00:18:01,819 --> 00:18:06,743
But actually having tasks that took two minutes or two days or two hours

322
00:18:07,323 --> 00:18:12,207
was a great way to keep having that constant positive reinforcement that I was going in the right direction.

323
00:18:12,227 --> 00:18:16,890
And I think that's really important for momentum and morale when you have a big project ahead of you.

324
00:18:19,549 --> 00:18:21,050
So how can you do this?

325
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,895
This is really dependent on developer or team or individual.

326
00:18:26,595 --> 00:18:29,999
I know some people who've used burndown charts in Excel

327
00:18:30,199 --> 00:18:33,802
or just kept a diary or written on a whiteboard every day

328
00:18:33,822 --> 00:18:36,665
and cleared it down and started again the next day.

329
00:18:37,746 --> 00:18:43,388
But for me I used Trello because I thought it was a really great visual representation of what I was creating.

330
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:46,770
I could color code each of the areas of that MVP.

331
00:18:47,630 --> 00:18:50,431
And as you can see with this tiny articulus,

332
00:18:50,971 --> 00:18:53,953
this is what I mean about that constant positive reinforcement.

333
00:18:54,193 --> 00:18:56,694
I could break each task down even further,

334
00:18:56,774 --> 00:19:00,535
so I always had that visual representation that it was going in the right way.

335
00:19:05,361 --> 00:19:06,202
Code design.

336
00:19:07,062 --> 00:19:10,005
So when I start out on this and I establish

337
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,068
the minimum viable products, I was like, this is fine.

338
00:19:13,148 --> 00:19:16,931
I've been prototyping those bits in separate applications,

339
00:19:17,051 --> 00:19:17,832
separate projects.

340
00:19:18,212 --> 00:19:19,653
I'll just throw them all together

341
00:19:19,733 --> 00:19:22,195
because that's the sensible thing to do.

342
00:19:23,196 --> 00:19:28,681
And spoiler alert, it very quickly crashed and burned

343
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:29,802
and was a nightmare.

344
00:19:30,242 --> 00:19:31,463
So don't do that.

345
00:19:32,687 --> 00:19:36,129
What I ended up doing was having to go back and think more about,

346
00:19:36,409 --> 00:19:38,390
think more smartly about my development process.

347
00:19:39,171 --> 00:19:42,473
And some advice I was given, which I used and I recommend,

348
00:19:42,493 --> 00:19:46,335
is to have a visual flowchart of what you're creating.

349
00:19:47,196 --> 00:19:51,498
So what I did was I took each object, each element of my project,

350
00:19:51,678 --> 00:19:53,399
and I popped it down on a piece of paper.

351
00:19:55,210 --> 00:20:00,833
And so I very quickly built up a roadmap of the areas that I needed for my project.

352
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,615
And once I had all these pieces of paper and I could move them around,

353
00:20:04,635 --> 00:20:08,998
I could very quickly identify the data flow between them I may need,

354
00:20:09,018 --> 00:20:14,301
what objects needed to be aware of each other, any commonalities in the relationships,

355
00:20:14,841 --> 00:20:16,862
and I moved them around until it made sense.

356
00:20:17,422 --> 00:20:21,324
And only then did I transfer that into code.

357
00:20:22,634 --> 00:20:24,835
So to illustrate that a bit further,

358
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:27,537
I'll just give a really high-level overview

359
00:20:28,318 --> 00:20:30,939
of the networking element of the project.

360
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:33,581
Sorry, I keep doing that.

361
00:20:36,223 --> 00:20:41,387
So I needed a way to be able to control the application

362
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:42,948
if it was launched in virtual reality,

363
00:20:43,789 --> 00:20:45,290
but also if it wasn't.

364
00:20:45,930 --> 00:20:50,173
So my first piece of paper was virtual reality integration.

365
00:20:52,463 --> 00:20:54,805
So let's say that translated into code,

366
00:20:54,925 --> 00:20:56,886
I called this VR application.

367
00:20:58,047 --> 00:21:01,709
So then I needed to think about what that class would need

368
00:21:01,789 --> 00:21:02,629
in order to work.

369
00:21:03,570 --> 00:21:04,930
So then I started thinking,

370
00:21:05,110 --> 00:21:07,392
well it's gonna need the virtual reality integration,

371
00:21:07,512 --> 00:21:08,652
that's another piece of paper.

372
00:21:09,073 --> 00:21:11,254
There's gonna have to be some sort of player class,

373
00:21:11,294 --> 00:21:12,495
that's another piece of paper.

374
00:21:13,115 --> 00:21:16,557
The geometry, that'd be a selection, more pieces of paper.

375
00:21:16,997 --> 00:21:19,218
And so it's starting to build up.

376
00:21:20,746 --> 00:21:22,907
And then I'd think about the other side,

377
00:21:23,307 --> 00:21:24,868
the non-virtual reality side,

378
00:21:25,108 --> 00:21:26,508
and I'd repeat the process.

379
00:21:26,908 --> 00:21:29,389
And so I could clearly see quite early on

380
00:21:29,709 --> 00:21:31,410
that there's gonna be commonalities

381
00:21:31,470 --> 00:21:32,811
between these two applications,

382
00:21:33,411 --> 00:21:34,831
even though, these two classes,

383
00:21:35,352 --> 00:21:37,492
even though they were fundamentally

384
00:21:37,552 --> 00:21:38,793
going to be doing the same thing,

385
00:21:39,353 --> 00:21:43,255
rendering geometry and taking note of the player.

386
00:21:45,373 --> 00:21:48,034
So when I had these classes defined,

387
00:21:48,575 --> 00:21:50,816
I started to think about how they could be aware

388
00:21:50,856 --> 00:21:53,638
of each other, when they needed to be aware of each other,

389
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:55,899
and how to facilitate that.

390
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,702
So what you may find, again, if you use engines,

391
00:22:00,862 --> 00:22:03,984
is that it's usually a good, well, in code constructs,

392
00:22:04,524 --> 00:22:06,245
it's a good idea to have an overall class

393
00:22:06,285 --> 00:22:08,807
that has an appreciation, a visibility

394
00:22:08,847 --> 00:22:10,228
for everything that you're creating.

395
00:22:10,948 --> 00:22:12,989
So in this example, we could call it the manager.

396
00:22:14,175 --> 00:22:17,396
So the manager could have an instance of or a reference

397
00:22:17,416 --> 00:22:19,516
to every other class within your application.

398
00:22:20,197 --> 00:22:23,137
So it instantly is able to access the state of it

399
00:22:23,717 --> 00:22:25,138
and facilitate that communication

400
00:22:25,198 --> 00:22:26,618
between all the other classes.

401
00:22:27,498 --> 00:22:32,419
It could, for example, detect when a headset

402
00:22:32,679 --> 00:22:34,220
is attached to the machine,

403
00:22:34,240 --> 00:22:40,041
therefore trigger the virtual reality classes implementation

404
00:22:41,081 --> 00:22:42,381
to get started.

405
00:22:44,419 --> 00:22:48,141
So then if I look a little bit more at this area of code reuse,

406
00:22:48,422 --> 00:22:52,125
so like I said, both these applications share attributes.

407
00:22:52,425 --> 00:22:53,706
And usually when that happens, it

408
00:22:53,746 --> 00:22:58,109
means that we're rewriting the same or similar code.

409
00:22:58,850 --> 00:23:01,952
And so to reduce that, we usually have a base class

410
00:23:02,012 --> 00:23:03,773
which holds that generic functionality,

411
00:23:04,454 --> 00:23:06,195
but which still allows the derived classes

412
00:23:06,235 --> 00:23:09,138
to be able to utilize or override that,

413
00:23:09,438 --> 00:23:14,422
and also maintain their individual elements and behavior.

414
00:23:15,723 --> 00:23:17,224
And this is likely to change,

415
00:23:17,504 --> 00:23:20,126
even when you've got all your pieces of paper laid out

416
00:23:20,166 --> 00:23:21,427
and you've translated it to code.

417
00:23:22,067 --> 00:23:24,529
As you find new elements that you want to add to it,

418
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:28,773
or areas that you, sticking points you come across

419
00:23:28,793 --> 00:23:31,857
that you didn't consider, it will start to change.

420
00:23:31,897 --> 00:23:34,700
But having that roadmap, that visual representation

421
00:23:34,740 --> 00:23:36,763
already mapped out, just makes it a lot easier

422
00:23:36,803 --> 00:23:39,806
to be able to identify where you're gonna be putting in

423
00:23:39,866 --> 00:23:41,729
these new resources or changing it.

424
00:23:43,931 --> 00:23:44,832
So then testing.

425
00:23:46,430 --> 00:23:53,014
I found from very early on that it was important to have testing from very early on in the

426
00:23:53,054 --> 00:23:54,754
project and iteratively throughout.

427
00:23:55,295 --> 00:23:59,837
Especially with virtual reality, it was really important to have as wide a test base as I

428
00:23:59,877 --> 00:24:04,020
could because virtual reality was affecting a lot of different people in different ways.

429
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:09,643
And I also found, because I had my head in virtual reality all the time, I was more forgiving

430
00:24:09,683 --> 00:24:09,903
of it.

431
00:24:10,804 --> 00:24:14,265
So it's really important to keep testing on that wider audience

432
00:24:14,345 --> 00:24:18,986
so you don't get caught in that trap of sort of getting used to it and just going with it.

433
00:24:21,847 --> 00:24:26,789
Usability was a big one for me because I remember when I first showed my project to people

434
00:24:27,329 --> 00:24:30,730
and I was like, hey look at this, it does this and it does that and it's super shiny

435
00:24:31,470 --> 00:24:34,031
and they just went, yeah but how do I use it?

436
00:24:34,919 --> 00:24:38,920
And I was like, I've been sat in my little cave,

437
00:24:39,280 --> 00:24:41,260
really hammering on those technical elements

438
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:45,561
with no consideration for how the wider world would use it.

439
00:24:46,101 --> 00:24:47,982
Like maybe I just assumed they were psychic.

440
00:24:48,322 --> 00:24:50,842
And so it very quickly became apparent to me

441
00:24:50,862 --> 00:24:53,403
that if what you're creating isn't intuitive to use,

442
00:24:53,903 --> 00:24:56,304
then people just really aren't gonna take the time

443
00:24:56,344 --> 00:24:59,084
to get to figure out how to use it.

444
00:25:01,605 --> 00:25:03,905
So these more personal points.

445
00:25:04,860 --> 00:25:08,142
I actually heard a talk with an engine programmer,

446
00:25:08,562 --> 00:25:10,123
Tamir Tabori, who did a talk last year.

447
00:25:10,143 --> 00:25:12,744
And I don't often hear these iterated.

448
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,165
And again, they're obvious,

449
00:25:14,225 --> 00:25:16,366
but I think they're really important to point out.

450
00:25:17,046 --> 00:25:19,447
So the first is to pace yourself.

451
00:25:20,583 --> 00:25:24,445
So I'd find I'd start developing mid-morning, like 11 a.m.,

452
00:25:24,946 --> 00:25:27,587
and then I'd look up and I'd look at the clock

453
00:25:27,727 --> 00:25:29,508
and it'd be 4 a.m. the next day.

454
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,831
And like, I hadn't gone out, I hadn't eaten anything,

455
00:25:32,851 --> 00:25:34,251
I hadn't had a cup of tea,

456
00:25:34,271 --> 00:25:36,053
I hadn't spoken to another human being.

457
00:25:36,853 --> 00:25:39,295
And this was usually when I was trying to figure out

458
00:25:39,355 --> 00:25:42,096
how to solve a bug or implement something

459
00:25:42,116 --> 00:25:42,977
before I went to bed.

460
00:25:44,185 --> 00:25:47,788
But what I found is that if I took a step back and had a break,

461
00:25:48,168 --> 00:25:50,450
I went and got something to drink and I ate properly,

462
00:25:50,590 --> 00:25:52,311
I went for a walk or I spoke to someone,

463
00:25:52,872 --> 00:25:57,255
that I'd had the headspace to be able to go back to that problem

464
00:25:57,315 --> 00:26:01,198
and approach it in a lot more open-minded and different angle.

465
00:26:01,379 --> 00:26:03,220
And it just was great for productivity.

466
00:26:05,977 --> 00:26:11,702
Again, when you're on any sort of project, you learn what you're good at and what you enjoy,

467
00:26:11,722 --> 00:26:14,744
but you also learn what you're not very good at and what you hate.

468
00:26:15,565 --> 00:26:18,287
And I found that really tough to take.

469
00:26:19,128 --> 00:26:21,810
It took me a long time to be able to turn that into a positive

470
00:26:22,171 --> 00:26:24,313
and identify it as areas for improvements,

471
00:26:24,933 --> 00:26:27,796
but also as a way of identifying what I really enjoyed.

472
00:26:28,997 --> 00:26:32,339
And I think it's really important that if there's something you enjoy,

473
00:26:32,420 --> 00:26:33,801
to take that passion and run with it.

474
00:26:36,798 --> 00:26:37,798
and celebrate too.

475
00:26:37,918 --> 00:26:40,539
So like I said about taking off those many achievements,

476
00:26:42,700 --> 00:26:45,180
share and ask your friends and your peers

477
00:26:45,581 --> 00:26:47,261
and share it on social media too.

478
00:26:47,501 --> 00:26:49,462
Like social media is a great way to get

479
00:26:49,522 --> 00:26:52,303
that immediate response and feedback and feelings

480
00:26:52,443 --> 00:26:54,603
for the response to what you're creating

481
00:26:54,643 --> 00:26:56,064
from the active development community.

482
00:26:57,118 --> 00:26:57,699
and ask.

483
00:26:58,239 --> 00:27:00,640
There's no such thing as a stupid question,

484
00:27:00,860 --> 00:27:03,381
and even if you think the person is the smartest person

485
00:27:03,401 --> 00:27:04,922
in the world, they don't know everything.

486
00:27:06,563 --> 00:27:08,784
Asking is all part of the learning process,

487
00:27:08,964 --> 00:27:11,685
and nobody ever stops learning, so don't be afraid to ask.

488
00:27:13,538 --> 00:27:16,379
And also, this is important, so believe in yourself.

489
00:27:16,639 --> 00:27:19,800
If you're doing something that you're emotionally

490
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:22,380
investing yourself in and putting a lot of your time in,

491
00:27:22,901 --> 00:27:25,501
you can often get to sticking points where you think,

492
00:27:25,521 --> 00:27:26,822
do you know what, I can't do this anymore.

493
00:27:27,222 --> 00:27:28,482
I'm not smart enough for this,

494
00:27:28,542 --> 00:27:30,263
I'm not good enough for this, I can't do it.

495
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:32,763
But if you talk to the development community,

496
00:27:32,843 --> 00:27:34,764
you'll find that everybody feels that way.

497
00:27:35,004 --> 00:27:35,764
It's supernatural.

498
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:39,225
So you can do it, and you just have to keep at it.

499
00:27:40,245 --> 00:27:41,346
So, in summary.

500
00:27:42,387 --> 00:27:43,447
Set your goals clear.

501
00:27:44,827 --> 00:27:46,647
Please do code design.

502
00:27:46,947 --> 00:27:49,688
Just please remember you're a human being,

503
00:27:49,708 --> 00:27:52,668
and collaborate, share, and celebrate.

504
00:27:53,609 --> 00:27:55,669
And thank you for joining me today.

505
00:27:55,889 --> 00:27:57,969
And I hope that there's been something

506
00:27:58,049 --> 00:27:59,250
useful for you to take away.

507
00:27:59,270 --> 00:28:01,810
I'm going to be in the wrap-up rooms

508
00:28:01,870 --> 00:28:02,890
if you have any questions.

509
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,371
I have a summary PDF of all the lessons learned part.

510
00:28:06,531 --> 00:28:07,791
Or you can just throw a tweet at me.

511
00:28:07,951 --> 00:28:09,651
But thank you for spending your time with me today.

512
00:28:09,691 --> 00:28:10,492
I really appreciate it.
