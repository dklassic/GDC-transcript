00:00:11,412 --> 00:00:17,136
Hello. Thank you for checking out my talk. My name is Seth Hudson. I'm Associate Professor

2
00:00:17,357 --> 00:00:22,100
of Game Writing at George Mason University in our Computer Game Design program. And today

3
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:27,024
I'm going to talk to you about, well, approaching the pedagogy of game writing.

4
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:30,162
So first off, my background.

5
00:00:30,182 --> 00:00:32,943
I've been at Mason now in some capacity since 2010,

6
00:00:34,384 --> 00:00:37,546
but my earliest experiences as an educator were

7
00:00:37,586 --> 00:00:39,167
in the English composition classroom.

8
00:00:40,088 --> 00:00:42,569
As a grad student doing literature and playwriting,

9
00:00:42,589 --> 00:00:43,630
it was sort of part of the deal.

10
00:00:45,831 --> 00:00:48,373
As time went on, I became more of a writer myself

11
00:00:48,833 --> 00:00:50,294
as I was teaching writing.

12
00:00:51,315 --> 00:00:54,817
Eventually went into a PhD program in education to,

13
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:56,538
you know, become a researcher.

14
00:00:57,399 --> 00:01:03,986
kind of odd that I've ended up now being a teaching, writing, researcher with this project.

15
00:01:04,046 --> 00:01:10,512
Really the culmination of all of those different things coming together. But first of all, pedagogy.

16
00:01:11,355 --> 00:01:12,515
Some people say pedagogy.

17
00:01:13,116 --> 00:01:15,017
I, you know, before every conference,

18
00:01:15,377 --> 00:01:17,918
every six to 12 months, I freak out

19
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:19,880
and make sure I'm pronouncing this word correctly.

20
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:21,921
You know, there's no right way.

21
00:01:22,121 --> 00:01:24,042
Ironically, it's really just a fancy way

22
00:01:24,082 --> 00:01:27,144
to say teaching or instruction.

23
00:01:27,664 --> 00:01:30,466
And so please don't be scared off by that word

24
00:01:30,606 --> 00:01:33,507
because we teach and instruct in lots of different ways,

25
00:01:33,587 --> 00:01:36,209
both in the classroom and elsewhere.

26
00:01:37,552 --> 00:01:38,673
Boom. So assumptions.

27
00:01:39,913 --> 00:01:41,534
I like to get started with these.

28
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:44,095
You know, you're going to meet me now for,

29
00:01:44,295 --> 00:01:46,736
I don't know, 27 more minutes,

30
00:01:47,476 --> 00:01:49,197
but to let you know where I'm coming from.

31
00:01:49,457 --> 00:01:50,857
Some of these things might seem simple,

32
00:01:50,917 --> 00:01:53,838
but basically instructors are vital.

33
00:01:54,486 --> 00:02:00,450
in developing effective pedagogy. Effective pedagogy relies on more than just personal

34
00:02:00,590 --> 00:02:07,094
expertise. And then finally, effective well-established practices from other disciplines,

35
00:02:07,675 --> 00:02:12,998
and in many, many cases they've been around longer than computer game design as a

36
00:02:13,339 --> 00:02:17,661
field of study in higher ed, that we can and should lean on those.

37
00:02:18,822 --> 00:02:24,565
But so, assumption one, instructors at the center. So this might seem, it's

38
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:27,906
definitely self-serving, you're looking at me talk while there's a picture of me

39
00:02:28,027 --> 00:02:32,529
and my stereotypical corduroy blazer up there on the screen, but

40
00:02:33,412 --> 00:02:34,653
This is important to keep in mind.

41
00:02:35,654 --> 00:02:37,736
As the people serving the students,

42
00:02:38,077 --> 00:02:39,598
the people in the classroom,

43
00:02:40,059 --> 00:02:42,782
the people developing the coursework,

44
00:02:42,902 --> 00:02:44,203
designing the curricula,

45
00:02:44,824 --> 00:02:47,747
it really is important that we don't lose sight

46
00:02:48,168 --> 00:02:51,431
of the value of the instructor and the buy-in.

47
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:57,173
rather than constantly chasing trends in the industry,

48
00:02:57,773 --> 00:02:59,753
or one of my least favorite things,

49
00:03:00,233 --> 00:03:02,894
developing courses or even whole programs

50
00:03:03,334 --> 00:03:05,214
that are essentially just there to market

51
00:03:05,314 --> 00:03:06,815
to get more students in the door.

52
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:11,236
Really remembering that as educators

53
00:03:11,276 --> 00:03:12,476
with lots of experience,

54
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:15,357
we already have a wealth of knowledge.

55
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:20,318
And as the people implementing this curriculum,

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,140
We can't forget that.

57
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,401
Assumption two, effective pedagogy evolves.

58
00:03:27,261 --> 00:03:29,842
After a while, you may find yourself teaching

59
00:03:29,902 --> 00:03:31,702
the same class over and over again.

60
00:03:31,842 --> 00:03:35,824
For me, that's been Game 332,

61
00:03:36,304 --> 00:03:38,544
Story Design for Computer Games, RS.

62
00:03:39,284 --> 00:03:41,745
I've taught the course since 2010.

63
00:03:42,605 --> 00:03:43,986
Didn't really know what to do when I started,

64
00:03:44,186 --> 00:03:46,846
changed it up every semester, still do.

65
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:47,887
Right?

66
00:03:48,648 --> 00:03:53,232
But when we evolve, we allow ourselves to A, keep it fresh.

67
00:03:53,592 --> 00:03:54,233
We're people too.

68
00:03:54,253 --> 00:03:55,354
We're not teaching robots.

69
00:03:55,854 --> 00:03:59,958
But B, to actually not just be pie in the sky.

70
00:04:00,278 --> 00:04:02,880
Like if I could teach them everything I wanted to

71
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,544
and had access and all the time, that would be terrific.

72
00:04:07,004 --> 00:04:09,426
But we have to be practical.

73
00:04:09,446 --> 00:04:13,190
And we have to evolve and make choices and edit what we do.

74
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:19,453
Assumption three, effective instructors should engage established disciplines.

75
00:04:20,634 --> 00:04:27,417
And again, I don't know if it, well, it wasn't obvious to me. It took a while. I was chasing

76
00:04:27,457 --> 00:04:34,000
this new thing, right? You know, games are this frontier in storytelling. You know, the stuff I

77
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,961
did decades ago in graduate school.

78
00:04:36,461 --> 00:04:38,682
was just boring, it was stuff I had to do.

79
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,503
After a while, I saw the relevance

80
00:04:41,603 --> 00:04:44,865
and I realized today to really think about

81
00:04:45,585 --> 00:04:47,986
what got you, if you are an educator,

82
00:04:48,346 --> 00:04:51,107
what got you to higher ed in the first place.

83
00:04:51,168 --> 00:04:53,689
Maybe your background is in traditional art.

84
00:04:54,569 --> 00:04:56,110
Maybe it's in programming.

85
00:04:56,150 --> 00:04:57,730
Maybe it's in something completely different.

86
00:04:59,603 --> 00:05:03,527
you know, what was it that helped you learn?

87
00:05:04,227 --> 00:05:05,669
And there's a chance there's more to that

88
00:05:06,069 --> 00:05:07,290
than you realize at first.

89
00:05:08,011 --> 00:05:09,553
But so arriving at a topic,

90
00:05:10,834 --> 00:05:12,616
I was told that it's completely natural

91
00:05:12,656 --> 00:05:13,557
to take a sip of water.

92
00:05:18,230 --> 00:05:21,212
So at first, I was overly ambitious as many researchers.

93
00:05:21,292 --> 00:05:25,095
I wanted this 20,000 foot view of computer game design,

94
00:05:25,135 --> 00:05:27,397
this novel field of study.

95
00:05:28,618 --> 00:05:31,340
So I tried and failed many times.

96
00:05:31,461 --> 00:05:33,322
And I wanna give you a little bit of a rundown.

97
00:05:33,382 --> 00:05:35,244
This was my in-memoriam list.

98
00:05:36,385 --> 00:05:39,567
So the first research project I wanted to do,

99
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:40,188
and I, you know,

100
00:05:40,568 --> 00:05:44,730
went through all the steps through IRB, had to recruit people, sit them down.

101
00:05:44,750 --> 00:05:51,635
I was interested in literature. I was sure that the classics and the contemporary fiction

102
00:05:52,015 --> 00:05:55,917
and drama, that there was something there that game design students,

103
00:05:56,798 --> 00:05:59,119
regardless of their specialty, that they needed to know.

104
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:03,802
It was great. I got to have some really cool conversations with people that I

105
00:06:03,862 --> 00:06:09,005
recorded and spent hours transcribing. Nothing really came out of that. Nothing useful.

106
00:06:10,365 --> 00:06:15,187
So the next step was to try and get a cross-section

107
00:06:15,588 --> 00:06:18,629
to find out what we should really be teaching students.

108
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:24,011
And when I say that, the belief that the technology is always

109
00:06:24,071 --> 00:06:26,012
changing, and it's hard to keep up with.

110
00:06:26,072 --> 00:06:29,393
But what are those core, those higher order thinking skills,

111
00:06:30,053 --> 00:06:32,594
and what does that mean in context?

112
00:06:33,115 --> 00:06:35,776
And so went around, recruited, actually got travel money

113
00:06:35,856 --> 00:06:37,096
to go to some conferences.

114
00:06:37,877 --> 00:06:38,777
Lots of opinions.

115
00:06:40,437 --> 00:06:42,178
None of them very useful for students.

116
00:06:43,758 --> 00:06:47,399
Yeah, and so then finally, it's sort of a, as a result,

117
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:51,440
I ended up, you know, wanting to find out,

118
00:06:51,460 --> 00:06:53,560
well, what do the folks in the industry

119
00:06:54,261 --> 00:06:55,501
think we teach students?

120
00:06:55,621 --> 00:06:57,121
I was concerned about the value

121
00:06:57,621 --> 00:06:59,362
of a computer game design degree.

122
00:06:59,942 --> 00:07:01,762
And so, you know, sought that out,

123
00:07:02,243 --> 00:07:03,883
just sort of off the tops of your heads.

124
00:07:04,443 --> 00:07:07,164
And again, that was really just frustrating.

125
00:07:07,684 --> 00:07:07,824
So.

126
00:07:09,753 --> 00:07:11,055
Took a step back, big breath,

127
00:07:11,175 --> 00:07:13,297
kind of like that drink of water, so natural.

128
00:07:13,317 --> 00:07:17,101
I wanted to define my purpose.

129
00:07:17,121 --> 00:07:19,783
Like why do I want to do this?

130
00:07:19,864 --> 00:07:21,005
Why do I care?

131
00:07:21,025 --> 00:07:23,587
It really was a concern for the students.

132
00:07:24,614 --> 00:07:31,077
The idea that students, at least our students in the US, incur all kinds of debt and hardship

133
00:07:31,917 --> 00:07:34,918
comes as a result of taking on a college education.

134
00:07:34,938 --> 00:07:42,702
And I feel a solemn responsibility, as I think, or at least hope most of you do, to make sure

135
00:07:42,742 --> 00:07:45,043
there's value there, right?

136
00:07:45,083 --> 00:07:48,444
That it's not just a piece of paper at the end if they jump through all the hoops.

137
00:07:49,554 --> 00:07:58,560
So with that purpose, and kind of thinking back on what do I know, well, I know writing, and I know writing research.

138
00:08:00,161 --> 00:08:12,850
So I took a step back and how can I use those tools that people in, you know, the field of writing studies, how can I use those to get a better understanding of game writing?

139
00:08:13,330 --> 00:08:17,093
And for me, in particular, that's the one thing I teach.

140
00:08:18,636 --> 00:08:26,458
at that time. I teach other things now. But so how can I learn about that and do that better?

141
00:08:27,539 --> 00:08:33,360
So looking at the literature was great and it gave me a framework and the literature didn't

142
00:08:33,501 --> 00:08:37,902
come from the game design standpoint. The literature actually came from things like

143
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:43,103
rhetorical genre studies and activity theory and just, you know,

144
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:48,418
Things from education, things that don't talk about game design at all,

145
00:08:48,858 --> 00:08:51,399
except that they actually are talking about game design.

146
00:08:51,439 --> 00:08:53,219
They just don't realize it.

147
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,360
And so I took that and decided to engage practitioners.

148
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:03,201
Again, rather than get a full swath in this giant sample size,

149
00:09:03,221 --> 00:09:05,202
I said, eh, I'm going to try and find writers.

150
00:09:05,222 --> 00:09:06,302
Just game writers.

151
00:09:06,322 --> 00:09:07,882
So I went through your basic steps that you do,

152
00:09:07,902 --> 00:09:08,702
learned about their experiences.

153
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:09,903
And I'm going to show you how you can do this.

154
00:09:09,923 --> 00:09:10,723
And I will be seeing you soon.

155
00:09:10,743 --> 00:09:11,143
Thanks.

156
00:09:11,163 --> 00:09:11,423
Bye-bye.

157
00:09:11,443 --> 00:09:11,503
Bye.

Bye.

164

Bye.

165

Bye.

166

Bye.

167

Bye.

168

177
00:09:13,523 --> 00:09:13,663
Bye.

178
00:09:13,683 --> 00:09:13,763
Bye.

179
00:09:13,783 --> 00:09:13,843
Bye.

180
00:09:14,783 --> 00:09:17,626
It was kind of that simple at first.

181
00:09:18,507 --> 00:09:23,411
So what I came up with were these areas of competence.

182
00:09:24,632 --> 00:09:26,473
So what are areas of competence?

183
00:09:26,493 --> 00:09:30,517
So basically, this just all centers around,

184
00:09:30,557 --> 00:09:31,137
I'll sum it up.

185
00:09:32,779 --> 00:09:34,380
Writing instruction should focus

186
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:35,981
on what we want students to do,

187
00:09:37,242 --> 00:09:38,804
not what we want them to know.

188
00:09:40,028 --> 00:09:42,889
A lot of times, if you're an old hand at higher ed,

189
00:09:42,909 --> 00:09:45,409
you know about writing your student learning outcomes.

190
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:48,130
We know about using verbs that are active

191
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:52,431
and the Bloom's taxonomy, but really just that simple.

192
00:09:53,252 --> 00:09:57,013
We have the luxury, really, in the writing classroom

193
00:09:57,393 --> 00:09:59,073
to be creating the stuff.

194
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:01,894
It's not like there aren't many things that

195
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:05,435
are completely out of the scope, out of the realm of possibility.

196
00:10:06,555 --> 00:10:08,096
But so these functional competencies.

197
00:10:08,989 --> 00:10:10,150
which I just like that name better.

198
00:10:10,170 --> 00:10:11,351
I like to call them FunComps.

199
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:16,616
It was an interesting discovery because I was hoping

200
00:10:16,836 --> 00:10:20,219
in sort of that traditional qualitative research standpoint,

201
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:22,902
you know, I did interviews, I recorded them,

202
00:10:22,982 --> 00:10:25,484
I transcribed them, I used Envivo,

203
00:10:26,065 --> 00:10:28,667
the software for coding at different points.

204
00:10:29,127 --> 00:10:31,550
And I really was looking for keywords and phrases.

205
00:10:33,251 --> 00:10:36,672
Other than writing skills, which ironically few people defined,

206
00:10:37,412 --> 00:10:43,735
even as I tease them out in interviews, it really came down to these broad areas.

207
00:10:44,795 --> 00:10:53,758
And just PS, one side note, relying on the sort of clip art icons here from PowerPoint,

208
00:10:54,118 --> 00:10:57,919
I love how understanding players gave us a shopping cart.

209
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:01,361
Immediately we're jumping to like marketing.

210
00:11:01,781 --> 00:11:02,021
Anyway.

211
00:11:02,847 --> 00:11:05,668
So why these fun comps?

212
00:11:05,748 --> 00:11:09,909
They were malleable and as a result, accurate,

213
00:11:10,449 --> 00:11:12,350
because the game writers in my study

214
00:11:13,090 --> 00:11:14,571
didn't really have a typical day.

215
00:11:14,631 --> 00:11:16,311
And I didn't think that they would, right?

216
00:11:16,391 --> 00:11:18,492
And few of us do in our jobs,

217
00:11:18,572 --> 00:11:19,953
if we're gonna be quite honest about it,

218
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:21,473
we might be a little precious.

219
00:11:21,993 --> 00:11:24,654
But so having these larger categories,

220
00:11:25,475 --> 00:11:28,216
yes, they were just the result of how do I,

221
00:11:29,116 --> 00:11:30,697
get something out of all this,

222
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:32,177
but it really confirmed.

223
00:11:33,290 --> 00:11:37,055
There's really no one thing like game writing,

224
00:11:37,356 --> 00:11:40,059
because game writing has to shift and be agile.

225
00:11:41,701 --> 00:11:45,006
And then I also realized, and as I see my typo,

226
00:11:45,046 --> 00:11:46,187
but I'm just gonna live with that,

227
00:11:47,169 --> 00:11:51,134
it allows n structure freedom and effectiveness.

228
00:11:52,035 --> 00:11:59,596
Again, relying on your experience as an instructor and understanding that, you know, meeting

229
00:11:59,676 --> 00:12:06,818
for 15 weeks for 150 minutes a week comes out to less than 40 hours, which I love.

230
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:11,759
It's like, ironically, I think an hour or an hour and a half short of being a full work

231
00:12:11,799 --> 00:12:11,999
week.

232
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,760
That's all the time you get in the classroom.

233
00:12:14,914 --> 00:12:31,827
But it lets anyone that might have a different, you know, slightly different background, a slightly different expertise, it allows them to know that they're still serving the students in something relevant to game writing and to narrative design.

234
00:12:33,655 --> 00:12:41,277
but doing it in an effective way with what they know how to teach rather than just prescribing something.

235
00:12:42,337 --> 00:12:45,378
I also like it because it allows us to assess meaningfully.

236
00:12:45,398 --> 00:12:53,980
I think it's a time for us as educators to take more seriously how we demonstrate our effectiveness.

237
00:12:54,761 --> 00:13:03,189
We spend a lot of time getting excited about our own work and theorizing what we should teach these students because we're passionate about it.

238
00:13:03,769 --> 00:13:08,374
Many of us take the next step to how. How do we go about teaching that?

239
00:13:09,635 --> 00:13:12,358
That third step of how do we know it worked?

240
00:13:13,339 --> 00:13:16,200
A lot of us don't get to, and so keeping assessment in mind

241
00:13:16,660 --> 00:13:18,621
when you're designing these things is very helpful.

242
00:13:19,161 --> 00:13:20,362
So now I'm going to touch on them.

243
00:13:20,382 --> 00:13:23,583
I'm going to touch on these functional competencies,

244
00:13:23,643 --> 00:13:25,183
these areas of competence.

245
00:13:25,223 --> 00:13:27,224
And the first one may be a little obvious,

246
00:13:27,544 --> 00:13:30,045
writing and storytelling.

247
00:13:30,485 --> 00:13:35,947
But this is a myth that you have to dispel many times in games,

248
00:13:36,188 --> 00:13:37,928
right, and particularly with our students.

249
00:13:38,348 --> 00:13:41,510
Writing is about more than just having ideas.

250
00:13:42,478 --> 00:13:42,718
Right?

251
00:13:44,219 --> 00:13:48,221
The ins and outs of taking something and understanding

252
00:13:48,241 --> 00:13:52,263
that writing is a process, and many drafts, and feedback,

253
00:13:52,803 --> 00:13:57,405
workshops, all of those things, it

254
00:13:57,445 --> 00:13:58,686
doesn't come natural at first.

255
00:13:58,986 --> 00:14:01,407
Many students will view it as, here's the prompt.

256
00:14:01,947 --> 00:14:04,508
What's, what am I going to get graded on?

257
00:14:04,528 --> 00:14:07,550
They submit it, and they hope for a grade.

258
00:14:07,570 --> 00:14:09,491
And if it's good, they're magically a good writer.

259
00:14:11,312 --> 00:14:13,915
Seizing the opportunities to practice elsewhere,

260
00:14:13,935 --> 00:14:18,400
you know, not everything has to be its own special class.

261
00:14:19,081 --> 00:14:22,885
And so if I have a student that is really passionate about writing

262
00:14:22,905 --> 00:14:29,453
and they've taken all the things that we offer in our department, and part of that has to do with space and

263
00:14:29,473 --> 00:14:30,955
you know, our workforce, whatever,

264
00:14:31,453 --> 00:14:33,614
Well, guess what? We have an excellent film program.

265
00:14:34,035 --> 00:14:36,616
We have an excellent drama program that has playwriting.

266
00:14:36,956 --> 00:14:40,477
We have an English department that has fiction,

267
00:14:40,858 --> 00:14:43,239
even nonfiction, poetry, all of these things,

268
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,700
but identifying places where students can get

269
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,741
what they need, knowing that, you know,

270
00:14:49,761 --> 00:14:51,922
yeah, it's not exactly, you know,

271
00:14:52,243 --> 00:14:53,983
implementing writing into a game,

272
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,724
but they're still building those skills.

273
00:14:57,005 --> 00:14:57,485
Lastly,

274
00:14:59,310 --> 00:15:02,853
Enforcing standards, and this is I don't, you know, this rubs

275
00:15:02,873 --> 00:15:06,797
people the wrong way. But in at least in our curriculum, there's

276
00:15:06,837 --> 00:15:10,320
lots of writing, you know, people write pitch documents,

277
00:15:10,941 --> 00:15:14,364
game design docs, or it might just be an analysis or review of

278
00:15:14,404 --> 00:15:20,349
a game or something like that. If we don't have rigor, and we

279
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,392
we end up rewarding that what I'll what I'll call bad

280
00:15:23,452 --> 00:15:23,953
behavior.

281
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:30,780
Mind you, I understand that grammar and mechanics is a construct, and that's a very complicated thing for another day.

282
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:40,343
But we might teach students unwittingly that, yeah, just throwing down an idea is good enough.

283
00:15:41,084 --> 00:15:42,504
And then writing becomes subjective.

284
00:15:43,524 --> 00:15:46,765
And we really know, well, it's not. We want to be our own best critics.

285
00:15:46,906 --> 00:15:49,847
But I digress. Into another drink.

286
00:15:51,782 --> 00:15:55,369
Communication and collaboration, not just buzzwords.

287
00:15:56,915 --> 00:16:01,018
Doing this with our students really comes through reflection.

288
00:16:01,378 --> 00:16:04,721
The idea of, you know, what does,

289
00:16:04,861 --> 00:16:07,042
why do some people groan when you say,

290
00:16:07,142 --> 00:16:09,624
hey, we're gonna break up into groups for this one?

291
00:16:10,605 --> 00:16:14,108
What experiences are good, which are bad?

292
00:16:14,128 --> 00:16:17,891
You know, how can you, how can you describe these things?

293
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:20,793
But if we get them in that reflective mindset,

294
00:16:21,253 --> 00:16:22,314
it deepens the learning.

295
00:16:22,714 --> 00:16:24,616
There's research to back that up just in general.

296
00:16:26,117 --> 00:16:34,721
But it deepens those experiences, even though they're like little microcosms of these college classes and it's, you know, a safe environment.

297
00:16:36,162 --> 00:16:43,006
It gives them those tools to be able to kind of roll with those punches later.

298
00:16:43,106 --> 00:16:51,111
Collaborative writing is vastly different than some of those traditional media that we just discussed that we could possibly lean on.

299
00:16:52,371 --> 00:16:56,473
Providing models, again, that is very important.

300
00:16:56,793 --> 00:17:00,334
This is where something like activity theory, for me,

301
00:17:00,435 --> 00:17:03,656
came in to sort of use that to present things to students

302
00:17:04,136 --> 00:17:07,798
to kind of visualize how all these different pieces interact.

303
00:17:08,678 --> 00:17:12,720
But when it's just a buzzword,

304
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:15,181
it's just one of those accessory posters

305
00:17:15,221 --> 00:17:16,941
with the picture of a bald eagle or something,

306
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,914
it's wasted, right? When really, when we get to the core, it comes down to emotional intelligence,

307
00:17:24,434 --> 00:17:29,197
right? Intellectual empathy or just plain old empathy, which is something good to teach our

308
00:17:29,237 --> 00:17:36,462
students anyway. Getting them to really try and understand other folks and where they're coming

309
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:42,105
from. And so yes, kumbaya, that's great, a more peaceful, verdant society.

310
00:17:43,177 --> 00:17:45,438
But writers need to be able to do that anyway,

311
00:17:45,558 --> 00:17:48,700
to understand characters and to inhabit situations

312
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,081
and think about motivations.

313
00:17:50,641 --> 00:17:54,063
And so if we can take communication and collaboration

314
00:17:54,503 --> 00:17:56,144
from more than just teamwork

315
00:17:56,605 --> 00:17:58,646
and make it into something a little more meaningful

316
00:17:58,766 --> 00:18:00,067
that has to do with people,

317
00:18:01,688 --> 00:18:02,688
it's gonna be more useful.

318
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:05,570
Systems and dynamics.

319
00:18:07,952 --> 00:18:11,116
When writing, many folks have that idea in their head.

320
00:18:11,136 --> 00:18:13,599
And one day, I'm sure I'm going to get there,

321
00:18:14,079 --> 00:18:16,562
where I'm going to have a big, old, puffy sweater.

322
00:18:16,983 --> 00:18:19,205
I'm going to be sitting on a lake someplace in New Hampshire

323
00:18:19,225 --> 00:18:25,032
writing my masterpiece all alone, nothing else happening.

324
00:18:27,141 --> 00:18:28,302
it's not really going to work that way.

325
00:18:28,762 --> 00:18:31,804
Having our writing students understand

326
00:18:32,264 --> 00:18:35,307
where systems and dynamics come into play.

327
00:18:35,787 --> 00:18:37,148
And this gets a little tough, right?

328
00:18:38,249 --> 00:18:39,110
You know, there is,

329
00:18:41,211 --> 00:18:44,734
there might be a belief that we want to break free

330
00:18:45,374 --> 00:18:47,496
of these, you know, the hierarchy,

331
00:18:47,536 --> 00:18:50,998
the power structures within game development,

332
00:18:51,439 --> 00:18:52,580
at least at the AAA level.

333
00:18:55,014 --> 00:18:56,215
And that's great, right?

334
00:18:56,655 --> 00:18:58,057
I would argue the first step there

335
00:18:58,117 --> 00:19:00,620
is understanding how those work,

336
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:03,824
rather than just, you know,

337
00:19:03,984 --> 00:19:05,847
oh, I couldn't possibly engage in that,

338
00:19:05,867 --> 00:19:07,589
I'm gonna be an indie.

339
00:19:07,769 --> 00:19:11,794
But really try and isolate where individuals exist.

340
00:19:13,660 --> 00:19:15,741
to know where we can exist.

341
00:19:16,942 --> 00:19:20,183
But two, to appreciate then that it's not just you

342
00:19:20,283 --> 00:19:20,904
in that system.

343
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:24,905
There are many different yous, a flock of sheep, I guess,

344
00:19:25,886 --> 00:19:26,526
unintentionally.

345
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:32,469
But looking, activities and things that allow students

346
00:19:32,609 --> 00:19:37,051
a chance to realize that sometimes they may be using

347
00:19:37,091 --> 00:19:39,532
their skills to generate new content.

348
00:19:40,032 --> 00:19:41,573
Sometimes they may just be

349
00:19:42,888 --> 00:19:46,652
you know, writing, you know, PR or box copy

350
00:19:46,673 --> 00:19:47,594
or something like that.

351
00:19:47,934 --> 00:19:51,599
But understanding that system of all the things

352
00:19:51,659 --> 00:19:55,563
and how they relate, and it's easier said than done,

353
00:19:55,583 --> 00:19:58,026
but that's an absolute key.

354
00:19:58,955 --> 00:20:04,396
Tool proficiency, this is the last one. And I'll say the understanding dynamics and systems,

355
00:20:05,777 --> 00:20:12,258
you know, both of these really, I think, tie more closely to folks that aren't as directly engaged

356
00:20:12,798 --> 00:20:17,820
in game development. You know, many students that aren't necessarily game design students,

357
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,421
they do something else. They're writers. They just love games.

358
00:20:22,602 --> 00:20:30,873
But this idea that we're not looking for students to master a particular software, right, that

359
00:20:31,881 --> 00:20:39,807
what they need to do to be successful is to be flexible, to be able to pick something up rather quickly.

360
00:20:39,927 --> 00:20:47,934
So if we can instill that willingness to self-teach, that is so valuable, right?

361
00:20:48,254 --> 00:20:50,996
How do we assess that? I don't know.

362
00:20:51,637 --> 00:20:58,782
But part of it is making students deal with a lack of, I guess a lack of comfort.

363
00:20:59,142 --> 00:21:00,383
There's not always a right way.

364
00:21:01,176 --> 00:21:02,357
There's usually good and bad.

365
00:21:03,838 --> 00:21:09,042
And so having them do work that they embrace is original.

366
00:21:09,122 --> 00:21:12,204
And yes, you're using this particular tool,

367
00:21:12,764 --> 00:21:15,366
but we don't want you to just fill in a form

368
00:21:15,706 --> 00:21:17,868
and find a template and do that exact same thing.

369
00:21:18,268 --> 00:21:19,649
We want you to play around with it.

370
00:21:19,709 --> 00:21:21,350
We want you to be a tinkerer.

371
00:21:23,412 --> 00:21:25,473
And just personally, as an instructor,

372
00:21:26,675 --> 00:21:30,438
It's a real pleasure sometimes, right,

373
00:21:30,478 --> 00:21:32,439
to see what students come up with.

374
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,521
Other places to work on this,

375
00:21:35,621 --> 00:21:39,004
besides just the game design or game writing class,

376
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,325
anything where you have to learn a tool,

377
00:21:41,545 --> 00:21:43,326
or you have to learn how to do your recording

378
00:21:43,366 --> 00:21:44,347
for your big conference.

379
00:21:45,588 --> 00:21:49,070
But thinking of the statistics program, SPSS,

380
00:21:49,530 --> 00:21:52,552
or the coding software that I used, Envivo,

381
00:21:52,973 --> 00:21:54,994
those were not intuitive at all.

382
00:21:56,952 --> 00:21:59,454
But you have to figure it out to move forward.

383
00:22:00,354 --> 00:22:02,896
Finally, understanding play and understanding players.

384
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:08,019
There's an assumption, I didn't put it on the list at the beginning,

385
00:22:08,079 --> 00:22:11,061
but a student is interested in pursuing game writing

386
00:22:11,141 --> 00:22:13,943
because they themselves are interested in games.

387
00:22:14,483 --> 00:22:16,345
Likely at some point they enjoyed a game.

388
00:22:16,385 --> 00:22:17,725
They were passionate about one.

389
00:22:17,745 --> 00:22:21,348
A lot of times you don't know why.

390
00:22:23,401 --> 00:22:28,166
Or in some cases, you know, they'll have very strong reactions to something they don't like.

391
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,369
I always point out that, well, someone does.

392
00:22:32,403 --> 00:22:34,344
Right? That's popular for a reason.

393
00:22:34,424 --> 00:22:35,504
It might not be a good reason,

394
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:38,885
but really trying to understand

395
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:43,326
what makes different kinds of players tick.

396
00:22:43,346 --> 00:22:44,786
And I don't even, you know, I misspoke.

397
00:22:44,806 --> 00:22:46,267
I don't even want kinds of players.

398
00:22:47,387 --> 00:22:51,508
Just why does anyone like particular stuff?

399
00:22:51,588 --> 00:22:53,728
It really starts with understanding

400
00:22:53,748 --> 00:22:55,729
via accessing prior knowledge.

401
00:22:56,549 --> 00:22:58,371
Why do you play what you play?

402
00:22:58,491 --> 00:22:59,852
Why do you like it?

403
00:23:00,612 --> 00:23:01,753
We have to be able to do that

404
00:23:02,134 --> 00:23:03,655
if we want to try and emulate,

405
00:23:04,155 --> 00:23:06,097
you know, isolate those different techniques,

406
00:23:06,137 --> 00:23:07,378
those different qualities,

407
00:23:08,098 --> 00:23:10,480
and make them our own in some way.

408
00:23:10,840 --> 00:23:12,582
Sort of just going from being a consumer

409
00:23:13,202 --> 00:23:15,884
to, well, maybe like a connoisseur in the middle,

410
00:23:15,904 --> 00:23:17,405
to eventually a creator.

411
00:23:18,978 --> 00:23:24,760
So, to kind of sum it up, that was a lot about those five areas. The writing and storytelling,

412
00:23:25,281 --> 00:23:31,823
anything you can give students where they practice craft, where they have to write, you know,

413
00:23:31,883 --> 00:23:36,865
things in a short amount of time, or they have to go through multiple drafts and really appreciate

414
00:23:37,385 --> 00:23:43,047
that process. Communication and collaboration for game writers, you know, it, it,

415
00:23:44,935 --> 00:23:48,218
Anything that complicates authorship, right?

416
00:23:48,959 --> 00:23:51,822
You know, students that work on a piece that they didn't start

417
00:23:51,882 --> 00:23:54,164
and they're not going to finish, right?

418
00:23:54,484 --> 00:23:57,627
Or, you know, switching up teams and roles, something like that

419
00:23:57,707 --> 00:23:58,187
in the middle.

420
00:23:59,228 --> 00:24:01,390
Having them reflect on that process.

421
00:24:02,011 --> 00:24:04,092
You know, was that hard?

422
00:24:04,873 --> 00:24:05,113
Sure.

423
00:24:05,354 --> 00:24:06,094
Why was it hard?

424
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:09,931
You know, what can that tell you about yourself and your process?

425
00:24:10,451 --> 00:24:17,957
Understanding systems and dynamics, genre knowledge, and when I say genre there, I mean very, you know, very specifically

426
00:24:18,277 --> 00:24:19,138
rhetorical genre,

427
00:24:20,198 --> 00:24:25,162
concept from composition and writing studies that I rely heavily on.

428
00:24:26,343 --> 00:24:30,526
Tool proficiency, any writing they do outside of word processing.

429
00:24:31,747 --> 00:24:38,108
is important. And remember, not every text is alphabetical. That's a different talk for a different day. And then understanding play.

430
00:24:40,069 --> 00:24:45,370
You know, I don't need to talk about game studies to this crowd. So valuable, right?

431
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:51,131
Really breaking things down to their essence, looking at the culture that surrounds games.

432
00:24:51,811 --> 00:24:56,572
There's a wealth of knowledge out there. These are all things that the game writer

433
00:24:57,432 --> 00:24:59,073
needs. They must have.

434
00:25:00,998 --> 00:25:03,238
Okay, essential roles.

435
00:25:03,498 --> 00:25:05,559
This is the sort of the next piece

436
00:25:05,979 --> 00:25:08,000
that allows me to tie these things together,

437
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:11,581
but we're looking at the wordsmith, sense maker,

438
00:25:11,741 --> 00:25:12,461
and advocate.

439
00:25:12,782 --> 00:25:15,262
These are the different roles at different times

440
00:25:15,322 --> 00:25:17,823
where these beautiful, you know,

441
00:25:18,143 --> 00:25:20,804
our five areas of competence, our fun comps.

442
00:25:22,225 --> 00:25:25,326
These are the ways that those are all deployed.

443
00:25:26,725 --> 00:25:32,189
This can be very useful when we're not just thinking about courses in game writing,

444
00:25:32,670 --> 00:25:37,174
but when we're thinking about the larger curriculum. But so tying it all together,

445
00:25:37,194 --> 00:25:45,661
or at least attempting to, you know, looking at these functional competencies. But then,

446
00:25:45,881 --> 00:25:49,905
you know, what different coursework or, you know,

447
00:25:51,106 --> 00:25:54,348
sequence of courses, or even workshops and things.

448
00:25:54,448 --> 00:25:55,868
Not everything has to be a course.

449
00:25:56,529 --> 00:26:00,631
But what can we do to allow students a way to practice

450
00:26:01,131 --> 00:26:05,153
and refine those different functional competencies?

451
00:26:06,456 --> 00:26:10,638
as these different things as that sense maker, who's trying

452
00:26:10,738 --> 00:26:15,159
to make something fit that doesn't really fit. Or that

453
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:19,381
wordsmith that just has to crank out, you know, 20 pages of

454
00:26:19,741 --> 00:26:23,582
barks for our he shot me, or that advocate, the person who

455
00:26:23,782 --> 00:26:27,624
has to has to make decisions, and has to really help

456
00:26:27,684 --> 00:26:30,985
incorporate the knowledge and understanding of their their

457
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:32,265
team and their project.

458
00:26:32,806 --> 00:26:38,111
in order to know what ideas need to be,

459
00:26:38,671 --> 00:26:42,515
and I hate the fighting for, right?

460
00:26:42,555 --> 00:26:43,696
Choosing your battles, I hate that.

461
00:26:44,056 --> 00:26:45,798
I'll say choosing your meals.

462
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:48,880
You don't wanna fill up, right?

463
00:26:49,121 --> 00:26:51,343
Sometimes you wanna wait until the next day

464
00:26:51,403 --> 00:26:52,964
because you know tacos are on the menu.

465
00:26:53,545 --> 00:26:55,246
I'll have to play around with that one a little bit.

466
00:26:55,467 --> 00:26:55,627
But.

467
00:26:56,730 --> 00:27:00,732
You can fill in these particulars.

468
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,273
I was really focused on game writing specifically.

469
00:27:03,293 --> 00:27:07,795
I engaged game writers in the industry, but ended up,

470
00:27:07,995 --> 00:27:09,276
I came up with this framework.

471
00:27:09,676 --> 00:27:13,637
So that allows me, it allows you to really,

472
00:27:13,978 --> 00:27:16,839
rather than try and nail down specific things,

473
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:19,840
and we end up with these five courses students have to take,

474
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:21,501
and maybe we realize that,

475
00:27:22,141 --> 00:27:24,464
Well, they can't actually take them because of their schedules,

476
00:27:24,824 --> 00:27:27,748
or maybe they're a transfer student and they're going to have to add time to

477
00:27:27,788 --> 00:27:28,489
their degree.

478
00:27:28,509 --> 00:27:33,315
If we can be flexible and we can see where these different things can happen,

479
00:27:34,416 --> 00:27:38,481
that's really going to help. I'll say too, just another,

480
00:27:38,602 --> 00:27:39,823
just to touch on this rigor thing.

481
00:27:40,946 --> 00:27:56,496
We should assess student learning. We can fall in love with our own ideas. We can rely on our charisma in the classroom, our students just being in awe that they get to be in college studying something like game design or, you know, writing stories for games.

482
00:27:58,152 --> 00:28:00,935
We have to keep in mind that at the end of the day,

483
00:28:01,035 --> 00:28:02,597
we need to be able to assess,

484
00:28:02,857 --> 00:28:05,379
are they learning what we hope they're learning?

485
00:28:05,399 --> 00:28:07,982
There's kind of have to get over ourselves a little bit

486
00:28:08,082 --> 00:28:09,483
in order to do that.

487
00:28:10,084 --> 00:28:12,366
And so when we don't have that rigor for ourselves

488
00:28:12,386 --> 00:28:13,867
and our students, we get in trouble.

489
00:28:14,488 --> 00:28:16,770
So one more note, I came up with WordSmith.

490
00:28:18,460 --> 00:28:23,344
You know, that idea of someone that might have to do anything with words at any time.

491
00:28:24,404 --> 00:28:29,708
But then, you know, thinking about within curriculum development, and these are older

492
00:28:29,748 --> 00:28:35,672
numbers from the Hebbia survey back in 20, I guess it was 2015, you know, and I imagine

493
00:28:35,712 --> 00:28:41,576
this is still the case, we don't have a lot of uniformity across our various programs.

494
00:28:41,856 --> 00:28:42,536
And that's okay.

495
00:28:43,177 --> 00:28:54,383
right? But if we take that Smith thing and we take out Word, right? I start to feel like this can,

496
00:28:55,384 --> 00:29:00,006
this framework can apply to lots of different things. That if we can consider our courses

497
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:06,390
and our curricula, this idea of these different roles that can rotate and we're kind of doing

498
00:29:06,670 --> 00:29:12,433
our individual little skills, our Smithing to different degrees, that that can really help us.

499
00:29:12,893 --> 00:29:19,635
So why just approaching pedagogy? Well, my assumptions. I believe we must continue to

500
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:26,037
evolve by leveraging past experiences, engaging other disciplines, and holding ourselves

501
00:29:26,097 --> 00:29:32,659
accountable. We can continue to improve instruction, and as a result, we'll sophisticate

502
00:29:32,679 --> 00:29:35,159
the field of study and ultimately the medium.

503
00:29:36,140 --> 00:29:39,901
Oh, that was my time. This was fun. So thank you. My name is Seth Hudson.

504
00:29:39,921 --> 00:29:46,224
Um, please send me an email if you'd like to know more about some of the things that I only sort of talked about

505
00:29:46,364 --> 00:29:46,844
but didn't

506
00:29:48,364 --> 00:29:48,985
And have a great day
