1
00:00:03,806 --> 00:00:09,528
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome event director of the Game Developers Conference, Megan Scavio.

2
00:00:09,688 --> 00:00:22,232
Good morning and welcome to the Game Developers Conference.

3
00:00:23,012 --> 00:00:28,494
The gentleman about to take the stage to present this morning's keynote doesn't really need much of an introduction.

4
00:00:29,368 --> 00:00:32,429
As the creator of some of the greatest games ever made, from

5
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:36,650
Railroad Tycoon through Pirates to the Civilization Series, he

6
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:40,271
has already taken on, taken his place on the list of legendary

7
00:00:40,311 --> 00:00:45,272
game design icons. And he's not done yet. So please join me in

8
00:00:45,312 --> 00:00:47,773
welcoming the Director of Creative Development at

9
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:51,654
Firaxis and the father of computer gaming, Mr. Sid Meier.

10
00:01:00,116 --> 00:01:15,641
Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. It's great to be

11
00:01:15,701 --> 00:01:24,024
here. The title of this talk is the psychology of game design.

12
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,045
Everything you know is wrong.

13
00:01:29,124 --> 00:01:32,867
I was going to call it, you know, people are funny, gamers

14
00:01:32,927 --> 00:01:36,570
are goofy, it's all in your head, or everything you know is

15
00:01:37,250 --> 00:01:40,553
questionable. But I thought everything you know is wrong,

16
00:01:41,834 --> 00:01:44,075
kind of get the juices flowing, maybe get a little more

17
00:01:44,095 --> 00:01:50,801
interaction. The premise of this talk is that ‑‑ is there

18
00:01:50,821 --> 00:01:54,103
any way to get the slides up in the back of the hall?

19
00:01:56,255 --> 00:02:01,697
is that game play, game design, is a psychological experience.

20
00:02:01,737 --> 00:02:03,458
Game play is a psychological experience.

21
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,960
When I design a game, a lot of my games are based on

22
00:02:09,161 --> 00:02:12,062
historical topics, the history of civilization,

23
00:02:12,823 --> 00:02:15,884
railroads, pirates, and the way I would generally

24
00:02:15,904 --> 00:02:18,485
approach those topics is make it realistic,

25
00:02:18,565 --> 00:02:22,327
make it true, make it about, the more historical

26
00:02:23,368 --> 00:02:24,728
I can make the game, the better it would be,

27
00:02:24,788 --> 00:02:25,108
the more.

28
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:27,646
railroad-y the game is, the better.

29
00:02:27,706 --> 00:02:29,146
The more pirate-y it is, the better.

30
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:32,928
And what I found in taking that approach

31
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:36,489
was that a lot of what I thought I knew was wrong.

32
00:02:37,429 --> 00:02:40,150
And the reason was because I really hadn't...

33
00:02:41,977 --> 00:02:44,440
taking into account what really happens in the player's head.

34
00:02:44,901 --> 00:02:46,824
And once that became an important part

35
00:02:46,864 --> 00:02:48,466
of kind of my design process,

36
00:02:49,227 --> 00:02:50,869
things started to become a lot clearer.

37
00:02:50,949 --> 00:02:53,393
So, the premise here is that

38
00:02:54,114 --> 00:02:56,277
by acknowledging that the gameplay

39
00:02:56,317 --> 00:02:58,680
is really a psychological experience, we can...

40
00:03:00,755 --> 00:03:02,995
Save ourselves a lot of time in certain areas.

41
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,536
It makes certain parts of the process easier.

42
00:03:05,556 --> 00:03:07,496
It certainly makes other parts of the process

43
00:03:07,536 --> 00:03:08,117
more difficult.

44
00:03:08,697 --> 00:03:09,497
But at the end of the day,

45
00:03:09,557 --> 00:03:11,817
I think we end up with a better game.

46
00:03:14,658 --> 00:03:18,839
In the process, as we kind of explore this idea,

47
00:03:18,859 --> 00:03:22,220
we're gonna kind of run into a few psychological concepts.

48
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:27,861
Egomania is one of them we'll have to explore.

49
00:03:28,061 --> 00:03:29,542
Basically, if you play Civilization...

50
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:31,641
you are an egomaniac.

51
00:03:31,942 --> 00:03:33,883
I mean, it says right on the box, you know,

52
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:36,666
build a civilization to stand the test of time.

53
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:39,108
And you're there like, oh yeah, I can do that,

54
00:03:39,288 --> 00:03:39,668
I can do that.

55
00:03:39,848 --> 00:03:40,128
No problem.

56
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:42,591
So you are an egomaniac, okay.

57
00:03:43,171 --> 00:03:46,714
We'll also be looking into paranoia,

58
00:03:47,094 --> 00:03:51,338
delusion, and self-destructive behavior.

59
00:03:51,358 --> 00:03:53,239
This is ways that players actually

60
00:03:53,860 --> 00:03:55,942
kind of make the game less fun for themselves.

61
00:03:55,982 --> 00:03:56,822
Things they do to

62
00:03:58,812 --> 00:04:00,372
to kind of detract from the fun of the game

63
00:04:00,412 --> 00:04:01,913
in ways that as a designer,

64
00:04:02,413 --> 00:04:04,313
we can try and minimize those,

65
00:04:05,374 --> 00:04:06,014
preempt those,

66
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:07,895
and try and prevent that from happening.

67
00:04:07,935 --> 00:04:09,415
So those are some of the things we'll be looking at

68
00:04:10,436 --> 00:04:11,876
in the course of this talk.

69
00:04:13,096 --> 00:04:15,417
So the first area where psychology

70
00:04:15,477 --> 00:04:18,858
really kind of plays an important role in game design

71
00:04:18,878 --> 00:04:22,259
is something I call the winner paradox.

72
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,440
In real life,

73
00:04:25,718 --> 00:04:26,939
you don't always win.

74
00:04:27,099 --> 00:04:31,403
There are, what, 28 teams in the National Football League,

75
00:04:32,004 --> 00:04:34,466
and only one of them gets to win the Super Bowl.

76
00:04:35,727 --> 00:04:38,830
There are 25 teams in the NBA.

77
00:04:40,231 --> 00:04:41,673
You know, they all go to the playoffs, I guess,

78
00:04:41,733 --> 00:04:45,696
but at the end of the day, there's only one team

79
00:04:45,736 --> 00:04:47,118
that gets to hold the.

80
00:04:47,948 --> 00:04:52,110
golden trophy of NBA champion-ness or whatever that is.

81
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:57,432
So in the real world, you don't always win.

82
00:04:58,833 --> 00:05:02,934
However, in the world of games, you pretty much always win.

83
00:05:04,735 --> 00:05:07,476
And the psychological phenomenon is that the player

84
00:05:07,516 --> 00:05:10,857
doesn't really complain about that, doesn't object.

85
00:05:11,437 --> 00:05:12,278
That's not a problem.

86
00:05:12,298 --> 00:05:15,059
I don't get letters saying, dear Sid, I loved your game,

87
00:05:15,099 --> 00:05:17,080
but I won way too much.

88
00:05:19,147 --> 00:05:22,211
And this is actually true of other forms of entertainment.

89
00:05:23,513 --> 00:05:26,417
You know, Rambo, you know, at the end of the movie

90
00:05:26,457 --> 00:05:27,298
he's going to come out alright.

91
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,522
Sherlock Holmes always solves the mystery

92
00:05:30,582 --> 00:05:33,687
by the end of the chapter.

93
00:05:35,047 --> 00:05:37,027
I think this is kind of fundamental to entertainment,

94
00:05:37,147 --> 00:05:39,348
but it's certainly something that we're aware of

95
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:42,029
in designing video games,

96
00:05:42,049 --> 00:05:46,411
that the player's looking for a satisfactory conclusion.

97
00:05:46,771 --> 00:05:49,192
That might not always include winning,

98
00:05:49,272 --> 00:05:50,812
but very often it does.

99
00:05:51,993 --> 00:05:54,273
And this idea of kind of a satisfactory conclusion

100
00:05:54,293 --> 00:05:56,954
to the game, I think, is something to really keep in mind

101
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:58,695
in the design process.

102
00:06:00,882 --> 00:06:04,184
Some of the tools that we have at our disposal to create this

103
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:07,785
journey for the player through the game, reward and

104
00:06:08,045 --> 00:06:10,987
punishment. In other words, good things happening to the player,

105
00:06:11,367 --> 00:06:13,788
not so good things happening to the player. There's an

106
00:06:13,848 --> 00:06:18,230
interesting dichotomy in how these are deployed in games.

107
00:06:19,750 --> 00:06:24,112
When you reward the player, you discovered this cool place on

108
00:06:24,132 --> 00:06:27,954
the map, here's 100 gold. The player

109
00:06:29,413 --> 00:06:31,635
gladly accepts that, doesn't question,

110
00:06:31,896 --> 00:06:34,218
did I really earn that, do I deserve that?

111
00:06:34,999 --> 00:06:39,103
Players are very much inclined to accept anything

112
00:06:39,123 --> 00:06:43,607
you give them gladly and feel it was their own clever play,

113
00:06:43,647 --> 00:06:46,890
their own incredible strategy that earned them

114
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:47,951
that cool reward.

115
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:52,155
On the other hand, if something bad happens to the player,

116
00:06:53,772 --> 00:06:55,954
your game is broken, there's something horribly wrong,

117
00:06:55,974 --> 00:06:59,859
the game is cheating, it's really important

118
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:02,522
to be very careful with the setbacks

119
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:04,745
that the player experiences that is the game.

120
00:07:05,045 --> 00:07:06,347
It's important that the player understand

121
00:07:06,427 --> 00:07:08,950
why those things happened, and especially

122
00:07:09,351 --> 00:07:12,054
how to prevent that from happening the next time.

123
00:07:13,401 --> 00:07:15,221
And any time you can kind of plant that seed

124
00:07:15,422 --> 00:07:17,282
of the next time in the player's head,

125
00:07:18,023 --> 00:07:20,604
you're well on your way to this idea of replayability,

126
00:07:20,644 --> 00:07:21,804
that the player's going to play again.

127
00:07:21,844 --> 00:07:23,305
Next time I'm going to try something different,

128
00:07:23,345 --> 00:07:24,505
maybe that might not happen.

129
00:07:25,126 --> 00:07:29,228
So a big part of the value of these games

130
00:07:29,308 --> 00:07:30,748
is in their replayability.

131
00:07:30,808 --> 00:07:32,269
So any opportunity that you have

132
00:07:32,329 --> 00:07:36,071
to plant the seed of replayability, I think, is important.

133
00:07:36,671 --> 00:07:39,292
And by really carefully handling the idea

134
00:07:39,352 --> 00:07:40,893
of punishment and setbacks, where,

135
00:07:41,513 --> 00:07:43,796
where you explain why it happened

136
00:07:43,816 --> 00:07:45,779
and how it can be rendered the next time.

137
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,381
That's very important.

138
00:07:48,522 --> 00:07:50,705
In terms of rewards, another key thing

139
00:07:50,725 --> 00:07:53,929
that we think about is the first 15 minutes.

140
00:07:54,070 --> 00:07:55,652
One of our rules of game design

141
00:07:55,712 --> 00:07:57,374
is that the first 15 minutes have to be.

142
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,062
Really compelling, really fun, kind of almost a foreshadowing

143
00:08:02,142 --> 00:08:04,564
of all the cool stuff that's going to happen later in the game.

144
00:08:04,584 --> 00:08:10,889
And these rewards are really a way of making the player feel comfortable in this world.

145
00:08:11,769 --> 00:08:13,571
Letting them know that they're on the right track.

146
00:08:13,591 --> 00:08:18,875
They're on their way, cool stuff is happening, and even cooler stuff is going to be happening later on.

147
00:08:19,315 --> 00:08:22,918
And these early rewards, you can almost not reward the player enough.

148
00:08:23,558 --> 00:08:25,119
in the very early stages of the game

149
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,320
to kind of get them invested, get them committed,

150
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:31,001
get them to be part of the world that you're creating.

151
00:08:33,102 --> 00:08:36,063
Now this doesn't negate the value of difficulty levels.

152
00:08:37,064 --> 00:08:40,845
I'm not advocating an elastic difficulty

153
00:08:40,925 --> 00:08:43,887
that always pushes the player forward

154
00:08:43,907 --> 00:08:45,888
and never provides any challenges.

155
00:08:49,429 --> 00:08:50,169
A number of years ago,

156
00:08:51,971 --> 00:08:53,952
I gave a talk on difficulty levels

157
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:58,494
and was very convincingly made the point

158
00:08:58,514 --> 00:09:00,915
that four difficulty levels were the perfect number

159
00:09:00,935 --> 00:09:01,675
of difficulty levels.

160
00:09:01,695 --> 00:09:05,197
There needed to be one for introducing the player

161
00:09:05,217 --> 00:09:08,218
to the game where the player could basically always win,

162
00:09:08,818 --> 00:09:10,179
one for the casual player,

163
00:09:10,359 --> 00:09:12,800
one for the player who's really experienced,

164
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,220
and then the fourth difficulty level,

165
00:09:14,701 --> 00:09:16,601
which would be the ultimate challenge.

166
00:09:18,377 --> 00:09:19,518
I was wrong about that.

167
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:23,463
Apparently we need nine difficulty levels.

168
00:09:23,523 --> 00:09:27,307
The latest Civilization IV has nine difficulty levels.

169
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:33,114
And it really points out how this idea of progress and advancement...

170
00:09:34,235 --> 00:09:35,757
is so rewarding for the player.

171
00:09:35,977 --> 00:09:37,498
The reason we have these difficulty levels

172
00:09:37,578 --> 00:09:39,400
is to give the player this feeling

173
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:41,002
that there's always another challenge out there,

174
00:09:41,022 --> 00:09:42,223
that they've mastered this level,

175
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:45,285
they're ready to move on to the next level.

176
00:09:45,325 --> 00:09:46,527
And that's another reward,

177
00:09:46,607 --> 00:09:50,550
is this idea of getting to the next level in the game.

178
00:09:53,739 --> 00:09:56,601
you want your player to feel that they are above average.

179
00:09:56,641 --> 00:09:59,182
They're doing well and they're going to do even better

180
00:09:59,282 --> 00:10:00,462
as they go deeper into the game.

181
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:02,863
I think that, again, if you kind of follow

182
00:10:02,904 --> 00:10:05,165
the first 15 minute rule, it's very important

183
00:10:05,225 --> 00:10:07,246
that you kind of start the player off

184
00:10:07,606 --> 00:10:09,727
with a very positive experience.

185
00:10:12,908 --> 00:10:14,609
The unholy alliance.

186
00:10:14,649 --> 00:10:17,270
This is a concept that I want to trademark.

187
00:10:17,290 --> 00:10:18,811
I think this is a really cool idea.

188
00:10:18,831 --> 00:10:19,711
I missed out on the

189
00:10:20,682 --> 00:10:21,603
uncanny valley

190
00:10:23,104 --> 00:10:25,346
And I never trademarked interesting decisions

191
00:10:26,286 --> 00:10:28,488
but unholy alliance, I think is a

192
00:10:28,508 --> 00:10:30,129
as a concept

193
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:31,430
that

194
00:10:32,611 --> 00:10:33,392
in many ways

195
00:10:34,132 --> 00:10:37,314
Defines the relationship between the player and the designer

196
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:43,259
The Unholy Alliance is an agreement

197
00:10:43,459 --> 00:10:45,419
that the player and the designer make with each other.

198
00:10:45,559 --> 00:10:47,020
I'm going to pretend certain things,

199
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,100
you're going to pretend certain things,

200
00:10:49,240 --> 00:10:52,341
and together we'll have a great experience.

201
00:10:54,422 --> 00:10:58,242
So one of the things that we pretend as designers

202
00:10:59,103 --> 00:11:01,903
is that the player is good, you're really good.

203
00:11:02,614 --> 00:11:06,336
That's kind of a mantra from us.

204
00:11:06,977 --> 00:11:08,278
That we want the player to feel good

205
00:11:08,318 --> 00:11:11,100
about the play experience and themselves as they're playing.

206
00:11:12,301 --> 00:11:15,223
And one example, perhaps of where this kind of went

207
00:11:15,603 --> 00:11:19,526
off the tracks is in the history of flight simulators

208
00:11:19,546 --> 00:11:21,027
going back a number of years.

209
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:25,450
Early on, they were kind of easy to play,

210
00:11:26,091 --> 00:11:28,092
very accessible, you'd shoot down a lot of planes,

211
00:11:28,132 --> 00:11:28,853
you'd have a lot of fun.

212
00:11:30,498 --> 00:11:33,039
And then we got to where every succeeding iteration

213
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,661
of flight simulators became a little more realistic,

214
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:39,302
a little more complex, a little more of a simulation.

215
00:11:40,163 --> 00:11:44,325
And pretty soon the player went from I'm good

216
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:47,746
to I'm not good, I'm confused.

217
00:11:49,387 --> 00:11:51,888
My plane is on fire and I'm falling out of the sky.

218
00:11:52,768 --> 00:11:54,590
And the fun kind of went out of them.

219
00:11:54,790 --> 00:11:58,613
And I think we have to be aware of this phenomenon

220
00:11:58,713 --> 00:12:01,876
that it's all about the player.

221
00:12:01,916 --> 00:12:04,158
The player is the star of the game.

222
00:12:04,178 --> 00:12:07,802
Their experience is what's key, what's critical.

223
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:11,405
And keeping them feeling good about themselves

224
00:12:11,605 --> 00:12:14,508
is certainly an important part of the experience

225
00:12:14,528 --> 00:12:15,609
that we provide for them.

226
00:12:17,652 --> 00:12:21,055
Another part of this unholy alliance is the player's role.

227
00:12:21,636 --> 00:12:23,757
The player really needs to be willing

228
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:26,379
to suspend their disbelief.

229
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,382
They need to inhabit that character.

230
00:12:29,422 --> 00:12:31,864
They need to take on that role that you're providing them,

231
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:34,586
whether it's a king of a great civilization

232
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:37,629
or managing a railroad or being a cool pirate.

233
00:12:38,910 --> 00:12:42,152
The player has to be willing to suspend their disbelief.

234
00:12:42,172 --> 00:12:44,934
That's part, they're part of the bargain.

235
00:12:48,136 --> 00:12:50,637
When we go to a movie, my wife,

236
00:12:51,057 --> 00:12:52,598
I ask her after we've seen a movie,

237
00:12:52,618 --> 00:12:53,578
how did you like the movie?

238
00:12:54,179 --> 00:12:55,419
A lot of times she'll say, well,

239
00:12:55,739 --> 00:12:57,080
I came out of that movie twice,

240
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,021
or I never got into that movie,

241
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:00,221
or I never came out of the movie.

242
00:13:01,522 --> 00:13:06,444
Very aware of the value of suspending your disbelief

243
00:13:07,004 --> 00:13:10,105
to enjoy the experience or to make it more compelling.

244
00:13:10,205 --> 00:13:12,926
So part of our job is to help the player

245
00:13:12,986 --> 00:13:14,647
to suspend their disbelief.

246
00:13:16,148 --> 00:13:20,537
And I think in some ways, those of us that are old-time

247
00:13:20,918 --> 00:13:23,624
designers have a little bit of an advantage there

248
00:13:23,885 --> 00:13:24,466
in that we.

249
00:13:25,339 --> 00:13:28,060
We worked in the good old days of 16-color graphics

250
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:30,480
and things like that where we really had to work hard

251
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,881
to get the player to believe that what was happening

252
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:37,041
on the screen was the management of a great empire

253
00:13:37,241 --> 00:13:40,642
or building a railroad system or things like that.

254
00:13:40,762 --> 00:13:44,463
So I think having that experience was helpful

255
00:13:44,583 --> 00:13:47,743
in really understanding some of the challenges

256
00:13:48,263 --> 00:13:51,264
of getting the player to suspend their disbelief.

257
00:13:54,285 --> 00:13:54,765
One of the other.

258
00:13:55,842 --> 00:13:57,322
agreements that we make, I think,

259
00:13:57,723 --> 00:13:59,603
in this unholy alliance with the player

260
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:03,565
is the idea of moral clarity.

261
00:14:03,986 --> 00:14:05,386
And let me give you an example.

262
00:14:05,906 --> 00:14:09,748
Here's a screenshot from Civilization Revolution

263
00:14:10,569 --> 00:14:13,510
where we're negotiating with the great Genghis Khan.

264
00:14:15,331 --> 00:14:16,932
And one of the comments that I got back

265
00:14:16,972 --> 00:14:19,093
from playtesters was,

266
00:14:20,713 --> 00:14:22,554
these leaders are very,

267
00:14:23,993 --> 00:14:25,514
kind of cranky and aggressive.

268
00:14:25,554 --> 00:14:27,515
I might be winning the battle against them,

269
00:14:27,555 --> 00:14:29,016
they might be down to their last city,

270
00:14:29,036 --> 00:14:31,117
and they're still kind of up there saying,

271
00:14:31,297 --> 00:14:33,778
hey, you'll never take me down,

272
00:14:33,858 --> 00:14:35,759
I'm the greatest civilization of all time,

273
00:14:35,799 --> 00:14:37,860
come on, attack me, I dare you.

274
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:42,042
And they said, well, that just doesn't seem right.

275
00:14:42,102 --> 00:14:44,743
They shouldn't have that attitude if I'm winning.

276
00:14:45,538 --> 00:14:49,419
And my question was, well, what would you like them to say?

277
00:14:49,439 --> 00:14:52,380
Do you want them to say, oh, please don't hurt me,

278
00:14:52,420 --> 00:14:54,020
we have only one city left,

279
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:55,841
and there's women and children there,

280
00:14:55,901 --> 00:14:57,521
and please leave me alone?

281
00:14:57,541 --> 00:15:00,942
To me, that's like a moral dilemma.

282
00:15:00,962 --> 00:15:03,823
I mean, I want to win, I want to capture their city,

283
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,203
it's Genghis Khan, for goodness sake,

284
00:15:06,643 --> 00:15:10,484
but I'm faced with a moral dilemma.

285
00:15:12,465 --> 00:15:14,945
I think it's more satisfying, and that's something

286
00:15:14,965 --> 00:15:17,286
we discovered, it's more satisfying to win against

287
00:15:19,326 --> 00:15:24,087
bad Genghis, cranky Genghis, than it is if

288
00:15:24,107 --> 00:15:27,348
there was some kind of a moral cloud over

289
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:29,328
the actions that you were taking.

290
00:15:34,049 --> 00:15:39,270
MAD is a concept called mutually assured destruction.

291
00:15:41,206 --> 00:15:43,466
How many of you remember the Cold War?

292
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:51,089
Let's hear it for the Cold War, okay.

293
00:15:52,089 --> 00:15:54,890
The idea of mutually assured destruction was that

294
00:15:55,471 --> 00:15:56,791
we had all these nuclear weapons

295
00:15:56,871 --> 00:15:58,312
and the Russians had all these nuclear weapons

296
00:15:58,412 --> 00:16:01,493
and we could just blow each other up anytime we wanted to,

297
00:16:01,813 --> 00:16:03,774
but the reason we didn't was because we knew

298
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,975
the other side had all these nuclear weapons.

299
00:16:07,844 --> 00:16:12,008
And there's an amazing parallel to that in the relationship

300
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:15,450
between game designers and the player.

301
00:16:16,992 --> 00:16:19,694
The player can actually destroy the experience

302
00:16:19,754 --> 00:16:20,915
at any time they want to.

303
00:16:20,935 --> 00:16:24,578
They can quit the game, they can play in a way,

304
00:16:24,638 --> 00:16:26,279
in a different way, they can cheat,

305
00:16:26,319 --> 00:16:27,240
they can do all sorts of stuff

306
00:16:27,260 --> 00:16:28,781
to kind of destroy the experience.

307
00:16:29,753 --> 00:16:34,115
And as a game designer, we can mess up the game as well.

308
00:16:34,135 --> 00:16:36,816
We can kind of lose the thread of the fantasy.

309
00:16:37,377 --> 00:16:38,557
There was a game that we were working on

310
00:16:38,577 --> 00:16:40,858
at MicroProse many years ago

311
00:16:40,878 --> 00:16:43,520
that kind of illustrated this to me.

312
00:16:43,560 --> 00:16:46,161
It was an adventure game, and basically,

313
00:16:47,041 --> 00:16:48,922
you kind of started at the beginning of the road,

314
00:16:48,942 --> 00:16:50,903
and you adventured your way on down

315
00:16:50,923 --> 00:16:52,044
until you got to the castle.

316
00:16:52,905 --> 00:16:55,747
you know, finally got to see the king

317
00:16:55,807 --> 00:16:57,689
and had gone through this great adventure,

318
00:16:57,989 --> 00:16:59,210
and when you got to the king,

319
00:17:00,231 --> 00:17:01,752
all of a sudden it was revealed to you

320
00:17:01,832 --> 00:17:05,095
that the king who you thought was a good guy

321
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:08,198
is actually a bad guy, and everything was turned around,

322
00:17:08,218 --> 00:17:09,439
and you had to go back down the path,

323
00:17:09,479 --> 00:17:13,122
you just come back to the beginning

324
00:17:13,222 --> 00:17:14,763
to do the real thing that you were supposed to do

325
00:17:14,783 --> 00:17:15,284
in the first place.

326
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:21,235
To me, that was us messing up the game.

327
00:17:21,255 --> 00:17:24,317
I mean, basically, I can imagine the design meetings,

328
00:17:24,737 --> 00:17:27,038
imagine the look on the player's face when they realize

329
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:29,720
that all this work they've done has to be,

330
00:17:30,180 --> 00:17:34,543
was in vain, and the surprise, and the amazing design,

331
00:17:35,063 --> 00:17:37,405
they'll think, what an amazing design to surprise me like,

332
00:17:37,425 --> 00:17:38,865
and I said, no, that's not what they're gonna think.

333
00:17:38,885 --> 00:17:41,027
They're gonna think I just wasted eight hours

334
00:17:41,047 --> 00:17:43,548
on this stupid game, and so.

335
00:17:44,490 --> 00:17:46,031
they would, at that point, they would mutually,

336
00:17:46,351 --> 00:17:47,892
assuredly, destruct the game, I believe.

337
00:17:47,952 --> 00:17:51,053
So there are ways, I think, again,

338
00:17:51,473 --> 00:17:53,694
that we need to be careful that we're true

339
00:17:53,794 --> 00:17:59,896
to the story of the game and value the player's time.

340
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:05,898
Another part of this alliance I think that we make with players is in the area of style.

341
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:11,200
Things that convey what the spirit of your game is.

342
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:18,882
If you start the game off and have kind of a light-hearted music, atmosphere, cartoony graphics,

343
00:18:19,642 --> 00:18:21,723
and all of a sudden people's heads start exploding.

344
00:18:22,848 --> 00:18:27,975
then you haven't lived up to the alliance.

345
00:18:28,896 --> 00:18:30,979
You're not giving the player what you promised them.

346
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:33,002
On the other hand, if you...

347
00:18:34,303 --> 00:18:37,625
you know, if you have dark foreboding sound and music

348
00:18:37,685 --> 00:18:40,325
and it ends up being a very simple game,

349
00:18:40,345 --> 00:18:44,227
again, you kind of are fooling the player.

350
00:18:44,907 --> 00:18:47,548
And you know, if I'm playing a game

351
00:18:47,568 --> 00:18:51,869
that starts off light and happy and cartoony,

352
00:18:51,909 --> 00:18:53,850
all of a sudden, you know, terrible things start to happen.

353
00:18:53,870 --> 00:18:55,290
You know, that's when the player.

354
00:18:56,921 --> 00:18:58,422
loses their suspension of disbelief,

355
00:18:59,963 --> 00:19:02,445
and turns off your game and moves on.

356
00:19:02,525 --> 00:19:07,008
So I think the only way to kind of maintain

357
00:19:07,028 --> 00:19:08,909
the suspension of disbelief, which is critical

358
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:10,851
to keeping the player in the game,

359
00:19:11,511 --> 00:19:14,713
is to really make that a priority

360
00:19:15,053 --> 00:19:18,616
and use things like humor style, music, atmosphere,

361
00:19:18,636 --> 00:19:22,218
all these tools to be consistent

362
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:24,520
and keep the player in your world.

363
00:19:27,851 --> 00:19:31,172
So probably where it became most clear to me that

364
00:19:34,572 --> 00:19:36,473
player psychology has absolutely nothing to do

365
00:19:36,493 --> 00:19:40,774
with rational thought was in the process of putting

366
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:43,674
together the battle system in Civilization Revolution.

367
00:19:45,155 --> 00:19:48,375
My background is in mathematics and science and programming

368
00:19:48,475 --> 00:19:50,536
and I think of myself as a logical person.

369
00:19:52,165 --> 00:19:55,627
And what we did in Revolution was we would show you

370
00:19:55,687 --> 00:19:58,569
before a battle what the odds were.

371
00:19:58,930 --> 00:20:03,713
In this example, our attacker here has a 1.5

372
00:20:04,714 --> 00:20:08,476
and the defender, the barbarians, have a 0.5.

373
00:20:10,998 --> 00:20:13,380
They would have a one, barbarians are basically one,

374
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,902
but since they're uncivilized,

375
00:20:16,002 --> 00:20:17,663
they take a 50% penalty for that.

376
00:20:18,464 --> 00:20:18,924
So they're only 0.5.

377
00:20:20,822 --> 00:20:23,283
And part of the fun of being a designer is kind of throwing

378
00:20:23,303 --> 00:20:25,744
those little things into the game, you know, uncivilized.

379
00:20:26,004 --> 00:20:27,985
Minus 50%, ah, take that.

380
00:20:29,866 --> 00:20:33,407
So, in this case, as a mathematician,

381
00:20:33,427 --> 00:20:34,688
this would be a three to one battle.

382
00:20:34,728 --> 00:20:35,648
1.5 to 2.5.

383
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:41,591
You know, three to one, the attacker should win three times,

384
00:20:41,931 --> 00:20:44,152
the defender should win one time out of four.

385
00:20:45,373 --> 00:20:47,033
Very clear, very simple, you know,

386
00:20:47,053 --> 00:20:48,834
that's what mathematics says, that's the way it should work.

387
00:20:50,793 --> 00:20:52,574
That's not the way our players saw it.

388
00:20:54,975 --> 00:20:57,036
Basically, at a certain point,

389
00:20:57,376 --> 00:20:59,657
players feel they are going to win the battle.

390
00:21:00,757 --> 00:21:02,778
And they would come to me and said,

391
00:21:02,938 --> 00:21:04,259
you know, I had this battle.

392
00:21:04,739 --> 00:21:07,321
It was three to one, and I lost.

393
00:21:07,341 --> 00:21:10,662
I was like, well, yeah, you know, three to one.

394
00:21:10,682 --> 00:21:13,203
You're going to lose every once in a while.

395
00:21:13,223 --> 00:21:14,944
They said, no, no, you don't understand.

396
00:21:14,964 --> 00:21:16,065
It was three to one.

397
00:21:17,285 --> 00:21:19,967
Three, three's big, one is small.

398
00:21:20,748 --> 00:21:21,929
I had the big number.

399
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:24,611
Shouldn't I have one?

400
00:21:25,532 --> 00:21:28,334
So I realized, okay, there's something going on here.

401
00:21:30,375 --> 00:21:34,258
So we adjusted our system by actually breaking the battle

402
00:21:34,278 --> 00:21:35,959
up into kind of more atomic little battles

403
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:38,801
to make the results come out more

404
00:21:38,821 --> 00:21:40,322
than the player expected.

405
00:21:41,183 --> 00:21:43,985
And then I watched some more players playing.

406
00:21:46,873 --> 00:21:49,314
This time the player had won against three.

407
00:21:49,494 --> 00:21:51,475
The player had won, the little tiny one,

408
00:21:51,495 --> 00:21:54,395
and the AI had the big gigantic three.

409
00:21:56,136 --> 00:21:58,396
And I watched, and lo and behold,

410
00:21:58,416 --> 00:21:59,697
the player won the battle.

411
00:22:00,497 --> 00:22:02,237
And I said, doesn't that feel wrong to you?

412
00:22:02,257 --> 00:22:04,638
That you with your little tiny one

413
00:22:04,658 --> 00:22:06,398
won against a huge three?

414
00:22:06,418 --> 00:22:09,299
And they said, no, doesn't feel wrong at all.

415
00:22:10,768 --> 00:22:13,810
I had, you know, clever tactics and strategy, clean living.

416
00:22:13,870 --> 00:22:16,291
It all adds up to me winning.

417
00:22:18,392 --> 00:22:21,093
So we realized that something was going on there

418
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:24,335
psychologically that isn't exactly mathematics.

419
00:22:24,395 --> 00:22:26,135
I'm not sure what it is, but it's not mathematics.

420
00:22:27,216 --> 00:22:30,237
So we made a few adjustments, and I said,

421
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:34,119
okay, now are you happy with the way combat works?

422
00:22:40,375 --> 00:22:45,177
do expect to pretty much win every time. So okay, that's

423
00:22:45,217 --> 00:22:53,441
fine. We can live with that. Anything else? They said, well,

424
00:22:53,681 --> 00:23:00,704
there's this one little thing. I'm okay. Here's a two to one

425
00:23:00,744 --> 00:23:03,745
battle. Are you okay with winning most of the time but

426
00:23:03,785 --> 00:23:06,706
every now and then losing a two to one? The player said, yeah.

427
00:23:09,225 --> 00:23:11,527
I'm okay with that, two to one.

428
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:12,928
I should win most of the time,

429
00:23:12,948 --> 00:23:13,989
but every now and then I can lose.

430
00:23:14,009 --> 00:23:15,270
So okay, good.

431
00:23:17,411 --> 00:23:18,052
So what's your problem?

432
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:21,014
Well, I had this 20 to 10 battle,

433
00:23:22,015 --> 00:23:22,756
and I lost.

434
00:23:24,117 --> 00:23:24,397
It was 20 to 10.

435
00:23:24,457 --> 00:23:24,697
I said, yeah.

436
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:27,419
20 to 10, I had 10 more than the 10.

437
00:23:27,479 --> 00:23:27,579
I had 20.

438
00:23:35,569 --> 00:23:36,689
I said, you know, it's not two to one, 22.

439
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:39,271
No, it's 20 to 10.

440
00:23:40,732 --> 00:23:43,413
That's a whole different odds than two to one.

441
00:23:44,494 --> 00:23:48,816
Okay, so we actually adjusted, you know, okay.

442
00:23:49,336 --> 00:23:53,399
I can see you have 10 more, so that's a lot, okay, cool.

443
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:57,721
Okay, so now, you know,

444
00:23:58,081 --> 00:23:59,482
made the adjustment, gave the game back.

445
00:23:59,742 --> 00:24:00,423
Now are you happy?

446
00:24:10,010 --> 00:24:11,910
I lost, which is okay.

447
00:24:11,930 --> 00:24:13,250
We've had this discussion, I understand now,

448
00:24:13,310 --> 00:24:14,891
that every now and then I'm gonna lose a two to one battle.

449
00:24:16,111 --> 00:24:18,411
But right after that, I had another two to one battle,

450
00:24:19,271 --> 00:24:20,052
and I lost again.

451
00:24:20,832 --> 00:24:21,472
How can that be?

452
00:24:23,212 --> 00:24:25,433
How can I lose two two to one battles?

453
00:24:25,573 --> 00:24:27,793
I mean, one I can understand.

454
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:30,954
The computers have to get me, obviously.

455
00:24:32,094 --> 00:24:35,294
Okay, so we actually take into account

456
00:24:35,874 --> 00:24:37,175
the results of previous battles.

457
00:24:38,711 --> 00:24:40,731
Now, when we do our combat calculations.

458
00:24:41,632 --> 00:24:44,553
And then the player was very happy.

459
00:24:45,553 --> 00:24:48,974
And we don't really do this just to make the player happy,

460
00:24:49,615 --> 00:24:54,336
but it's really, when something happens in a battle like this

461
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:57,497
that feels wrong, we start to lose that suspension

462
00:24:57,517 --> 00:24:59,298
of disbelief, the player comes out of the game

463
00:25:00,118 --> 00:25:03,600
and starts to pay attention to other things

464
00:25:03,620 --> 00:25:05,360
that are going on, not what's in the game.

465
00:25:06,444 --> 00:25:09,145
It's all part of the process of really trying to maintain

466
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:12,827
the suspension of disbelief as the player is playing the game.

467
00:25:13,528 --> 00:25:17,250
And something really kind of clear and instructive

468
00:25:17,310 --> 00:25:18,731
about this process, I think, you know,

469
00:25:19,091 --> 00:25:21,733
the interaction between logic and science and math

470
00:25:22,293 --> 00:25:25,535
and psychology kind of really became clear to me

471
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:26,115
in this process.

472
00:25:26,155 --> 00:25:28,096
And, you know, I think it all makes sense,

473
00:25:28,136 --> 00:25:30,638
but it's very counterintuitive.

474
00:25:30,758 --> 00:25:31,859
And I think one of the things about,

475
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,001
really including the psychological part of things

476
00:25:35,582 --> 00:25:37,102
in game thinking and design is,

477
00:25:37,923 --> 00:25:41,284
it's gonna run into a number of counterintuitive things.

478
00:25:41,965 --> 00:25:43,605
And we'll see a little more of that later,

479
00:25:43,946 --> 00:25:46,407
but there are many times where that actually

480
00:25:46,447 --> 00:25:47,447
can work to your advantage.

481
00:25:48,027 --> 00:25:50,989
And it's not always quite the process

482
00:25:51,009 --> 00:25:52,309
that we just went through.

483
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:58,112
So this part is called My Bad.

484
00:25:59,980 --> 00:26:04,163
times when I really screwed up and kind of came to realize that it was because

485
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:08,285
my brain was too logical and scientific and I hadn't really included a lot of the

486
00:26:08,785 --> 00:26:12,767
psychological aspects of what goes on in games

487
00:26:15,008 --> 00:26:16,909
The first bad bad thing I did

488
00:26:17,815 --> 00:26:21,817
in life was to make Civilization a real-time game.

489
00:26:21,957 --> 00:26:25,178
The original prototype of Civilization was real-time,

490
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:30,020
kind of inspired by SimCity and that genre of games

491
00:26:30,060 --> 00:26:32,401
where you're kind of watching something grow.

492
00:26:33,441 --> 00:26:35,422
SimCity, I think, inspired a lot of designers

493
00:26:35,462 --> 00:26:39,644
to branch out in kind of construction-oriented games,

494
00:26:39,684 --> 00:26:40,284
growth games.

495
00:26:41,766 --> 00:26:45,187
But what we found with the real-time version of Civilization

496
00:26:45,327 --> 00:26:50,809
was that the player really became an observer,

497
00:26:51,469 --> 00:26:56,591
was watching what's going on, was really just an observer.

498
00:26:56,771 --> 00:27:00,452
And the mantra that we had in mind for Civilization

499
00:27:00,492 --> 00:27:01,473
was it's good to be king.

500
00:27:02,953 --> 00:27:05,374
And we found that when we made it a turn-based game,

501
00:27:05,434 --> 00:27:07,375
all of a sudden, lights went off.

502
00:27:09,094 --> 00:27:11,596
All of a sudden the player was no longer an observer,

503
00:27:11,737 --> 00:27:13,738
they were the star of the game,

504
00:27:13,778 --> 00:27:17,661
they were the key ingredient, and they made things happen.

505
00:27:17,681 --> 00:27:22,205
Kind of ironic since Civ is now the poster child

506
00:27:22,285 --> 00:27:27,309
for turn-based gaming, but Civ actually started off

507
00:27:27,469 --> 00:27:31,092
as a real-time game, and that was my bad, sorry about that.

508
00:27:33,314 --> 00:27:38,457
Another bad thing that I did in the original civilization

509
00:27:38,497 --> 00:27:44,061
design was to include this idea of rise and fall.

510
00:27:44,101 --> 00:27:47,243
Wouldn't it be cool if you built this cool civilization

511
00:27:47,263 --> 00:27:50,405
and then you had this kind of setback

512
00:27:50,445 --> 00:27:53,446
and it started to crumble and just before it disappeared

513
00:27:53,486 --> 00:27:55,508
you rescued it and you came back to win

514
00:27:55,548 --> 00:27:58,349
even more strong and powerfully than you did before.

515
00:27:58,369 --> 00:27:59,690
Wouldn't that be an awesome experience?

516
00:28:01,490 --> 00:28:03,291
No, not really.

517
00:28:03,871 --> 00:28:08,473
What we found was that just at the cusp of the crumble,

518
00:28:09,253 --> 00:28:11,014
most players would reload a save game,

519
00:28:11,794 --> 00:28:15,675
and they would never experience the glorious re-rise

520
00:28:16,055 --> 00:28:18,056
that we had in mind for them.

521
00:28:18,316 --> 00:28:23,838
So Civilization is basically a game about progress.

522
00:28:23,858 --> 00:28:26,399
It's a game about rise, rise, and more rise,

523
00:28:27,340 --> 00:28:29,040
and not so much the fall.

524
00:28:31,191 --> 00:28:34,975
Another badness that I perpetrated was in the original

525
00:28:35,016 --> 00:28:36,097
civilization tech tree.

526
00:28:37,719 --> 00:28:40,503
The idea that I had in mind was that technology would be

527
00:28:40,583 --> 00:28:43,847
this interesting path of kind of discovery through

528
00:28:43,867 --> 00:28:46,731
the darkness and you would kind of never know where

529
00:28:46,771 --> 00:28:48,753
the different paths of technology would lead.

530
00:28:49,702 --> 00:28:54,123
It seemed to me totally wacky that you would be thinking

531
00:28:54,583 --> 00:28:58,564
back in 3000 BC, okay, if I discover ironworking,

532
00:28:58,604 --> 00:29:00,665
someday I'm going to have gunpowder in nuclear weapons.

533
00:29:02,945 --> 00:29:05,146
So we randomized the tech tree, we did a lot of things

534
00:29:05,186 --> 00:29:08,167
to make that process kind of mysterious.

535
00:29:10,127 --> 00:29:12,768
But once players realized, generally the second time

536
00:29:12,808 --> 00:29:14,348
they played, that there was gunpowder out there.

537
00:29:16,053 --> 00:29:19,335
Their only goal was, how do I get to gunpowder most quickly?

538
00:29:19,635 --> 00:29:23,017
Give me the road, don't randomize,

539
00:29:23,037 --> 00:29:25,218
don't mysterious-ize this thing.

540
00:29:25,278 --> 00:29:27,239
I know there's gunpowder out there, you can't fool me.

541
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:32,642
And we understood that players want to be in control.

542
00:29:32,842 --> 00:29:35,084
They really want to know what's going on.

543
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:38,626
And the kind of broader lesson from this for me

544
00:29:39,286 --> 00:29:43,368
was that any kind of randomness really needs to be treated

545
00:29:43,428 --> 00:29:44,769
with a lot of care.

546
00:29:46,163 --> 00:29:48,164
We also had the idea in the original Civilization

547
00:29:48,184 --> 00:29:50,145
of these kind of great natural disasters.

548
00:29:50,185 --> 00:29:51,225
You know, wouldn't it be cool to have

549
00:29:51,245 --> 00:29:55,288
like volcano Krakatoa blowing up or the plague

550
00:29:55,348 --> 00:29:57,649
and all these kind of famous world events

551
00:29:57,709 --> 00:30:01,011
happening in the game, you know, kind of randomly?

552
00:30:03,012 --> 00:30:03,652
No, it wouldn't.

553
00:30:05,653 --> 00:30:08,595
Again, whenever anything random happens to the player,

554
00:30:10,476 --> 00:30:11,516
paranoia strikes in.

555
00:30:11,576 --> 00:30:12,777
Paranoia was one of our early...

556
00:30:14,751 --> 00:30:16,251
psychological feelings.

557
00:30:17,851 --> 00:30:19,932
The player feels that the computer did that,

558
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:23,072
rolled that random number just to make their life

559
00:30:23,112 --> 00:30:25,073
more difficult or they were just about to win.

560
00:30:26,353 --> 00:30:30,754
So, random events have to be treated very, very carefully

561
00:30:31,734 --> 00:30:33,414
because if they're significant,

562
00:30:35,495 --> 00:30:37,115
basically the player will find the worst.

563
00:30:37,723 --> 00:30:41,345
and most paranoid explanation for what just happened

564
00:30:41,405 --> 00:30:41,825
in the game.

565
00:30:42,626 --> 00:30:45,908
Randomness at a low level certainly helps a lot

566
00:30:45,948 --> 00:30:48,910
to variety, replayability, things like that,

567
00:30:49,030 --> 00:30:51,771
but really need to be careful with randomness

568
00:30:52,812 --> 00:30:55,133
at a really significant level.

569
00:30:56,674 --> 00:30:59,956
I'm gonna skip the covert action rule.

570
00:31:00,096 --> 00:31:00,697
That's kind of boring.

571
00:31:02,057 --> 00:31:04,739
The dinos game was another mistake that I made.

572
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:10,641
a while back I gave a talk called, you know, Dinosaurs,

573
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:12,502
the Three Glorious Failures.

574
00:31:13,722 --> 00:31:15,703
Basically that was a game that I thought would be very cool,

575
00:31:15,803 --> 00:31:19,424
tried to create, did three different versions.

576
00:31:19,524 --> 00:31:23,865
One was a RTS type game, one was more of a strategy game,

577
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:25,086
one was actually a card game.

578
00:31:26,666 --> 00:31:29,007
And none of them really kind of gelled together.

579
00:31:29,147 --> 00:31:32,388
And I was disappointed, I thought dinosaurs are very cool

580
00:31:32,428 --> 00:31:35,409
and I may be able to make a cool game about this,

581
00:31:35,489 --> 00:31:36,609
but it never really.

582
00:31:37,527 --> 00:31:40,327
came together for reasons I'm not quite sure of yet,

583
00:31:40,507 --> 00:31:44,148
but what's interesting to me though is that

584
00:31:46,008 --> 00:31:48,449
after Civilization, that's almost the best known game.

585
00:31:49,209 --> 00:31:50,949
When I talk to people, when I run into people,

586
00:31:51,069 --> 00:31:53,230
you know, besides Civilization, the other question is

587
00:31:53,810 --> 00:31:55,310
where's the Dino Dukes game, you know?

588
00:31:56,330 --> 00:31:58,351
So this game that I never made

589
00:31:58,371 --> 00:32:03,392
is like the second most interesting game for gamers.

590
00:32:03,492 --> 00:32:06,352
So that was my bad, but I'll,

591
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:10,635
Life is not over yet.

592
00:32:12,916 --> 00:32:14,958
And Civilization Network, this is a new game

593
00:32:14,978 --> 00:32:15,779
that we're working on.

594
00:32:16,539 --> 00:32:18,321
Civilization for the Facebook platform.

595
00:32:19,346 --> 00:32:38,333
A lot of kind of fun game concepts that we get to play with here, you know, people playing on kind of an interesting schedule, you know, maybe a little bit of time a day, a little more time a day, kind of making the game interesting if you're playing at the same time as other players or if you're playing at different times as other players.

596
00:32:39,173 --> 00:32:46,655
The idea that you're playing with friends so that you won't that we can really focus a lot on cooperative gameplay also include competitive gameplay

597
00:32:47,175 --> 00:32:51,396
Individual gameplay all different kinds of gameplay mixed together. So this is really kind of a fun

598
00:32:52,677 --> 00:32:55,478
fun world to take civilization into and

599
00:32:55,778 --> 00:33:00,379
One of the ideas that we were that we played with here was the idea of being able to give gold

600
00:33:01,124 --> 00:33:02,284
to other players.

601
00:33:02,364 --> 00:33:03,705
It was like, wouldn't it be neat,

602
00:33:03,905 --> 00:33:07,888
wouldn't this lead to all sorts of interesting possibilities

603
00:33:07,948 --> 00:33:10,209
if we put into the game the ability

604
00:33:10,249 --> 00:33:11,430
to give gold to other players?

605
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,391
You could say, I'll give you this much gold

606
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:16,713
if you do this for me, or I feel sorry for you,

607
00:33:17,054 --> 00:33:18,615
I'm going to give you 300 gold,

608
00:33:20,236 --> 00:33:22,877
or hey, please give me some gold, whatever.

609
00:33:24,098 --> 00:33:28,421
There'd be this fascinating diplomatic negotiating dynamic

610
00:33:28,481 --> 00:33:30,262
that would arise in the game.

611
00:33:32,747 --> 00:33:35,589
What we found, however, was that nobody ever gave gold

612
00:33:35,610 --> 00:33:36,330
to anybody else.

613
00:33:38,252 --> 00:33:39,853
The thought did not cross their mind

614
00:33:39,893 --> 00:33:41,374
to give gold to other people.

615
00:33:42,795 --> 00:33:44,837
I don't know what this says about the human condition

616
00:33:44,977 --> 00:33:50,082
or the future of mankind, but it's kind of a sad commentary,

617
00:33:50,782 --> 00:33:53,024
I think, another bad idea that I had.

618
00:34:00,769 --> 00:34:03,431
in the blurb to this presentation

619
00:34:04,212 --> 00:34:08,134
was to explain how to save millions of dollars

620
00:34:08,895 --> 00:34:09,656
in game design.

621
00:34:10,696 --> 00:34:12,257
And so if you're interested in that part

622
00:34:12,277 --> 00:34:12,938
of the presentation,

623
00:34:12,978 --> 00:34:14,519
this would be the time to pay attention.

624
00:34:17,174 --> 00:34:20,574
One of the techniques I think that's very, very important

625
00:34:20,714 --> 00:34:22,835
in making AAA games on a shoestring

626
00:34:23,335 --> 00:34:25,936
is to really use the player's imagination

627
00:34:26,216 --> 00:34:27,496
as a very key tool.

628
00:34:28,816 --> 00:34:30,117
No matter how good your graphics are,

629
00:34:30,197 --> 00:34:31,977
no matter how cool your technology is,

630
00:34:32,577 --> 00:34:33,977
what's happening in the player's mind,

631
00:34:34,017 --> 00:34:35,758
the player can always visualize something

632
00:34:36,638 --> 00:34:38,238
more compelling, more dynamic.

633
00:34:39,499 --> 00:34:41,779
So the goal of everything we do

634
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:44,820
is to make something happen in the player's imagination

635
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:45,740
that is...

636
00:34:47,281 --> 00:34:48,221
that is really cool.

637
00:34:49,082 --> 00:34:52,003
And often, we don't have to literally show everything

638
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,504
in the game to make that happen.

639
00:34:53,684 --> 00:34:55,365
If the player can imagine what's going on,

640
00:34:56,006 --> 00:34:57,647
you know, imagine what Napoleon is doing

641
00:34:57,687 --> 00:34:59,207
when he's not actually on the screen,

642
00:35:00,788 --> 00:35:02,409
imagine what's going on behind the scenes,

643
00:35:02,509 --> 00:35:07,252
then we save a lot of money by not having to create

644
00:35:07,272 --> 00:35:08,793
all those assets and do all those things.

645
00:35:09,393 --> 00:35:12,215
And one example, again, from Civilization Revolution

646
00:35:12,995 --> 00:35:14,516
is this screen here.

647
00:35:14,536 --> 00:35:16,357
All right, it says.

648
00:35:16,826 --> 00:35:19,367
foreign rulers seek your favor,

649
00:35:19,787 --> 00:35:22,748
the Sultan of Zanzibar sends you a caravan of exotic gifts,

650
00:35:22,848 --> 00:35:24,528
including seven dancing bears.

651
00:35:27,329 --> 00:35:29,750
The principle here is something I call go with the flow.

652
00:35:29,890 --> 00:35:33,171
In other words, if it's something the player

653
00:35:33,231 --> 00:35:34,631
is already inclined to believe,

654
00:35:34,651 --> 00:35:36,752
if it's something the player wants to believe,

655
00:35:37,332 --> 00:35:39,032
it's very easy to make that happen

656
00:35:39,452 --> 00:35:41,153
in the player's imagination.

657
00:35:41,693 --> 00:35:42,873
The player looks at this and says,

658
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:46,798
Oh yeah, foreign leaders should be seeking my favor.

659
00:35:48,239 --> 00:35:51,299
And exotic gifts, cool, they should be sending me.

660
00:35:51,399 --> 00:35:54,000
And seven dancing bears, that's very cool.

661
00:35:54,100 --> 00:35:57,601
So it's happening, in your mind, the bears are dancing,

662
00:35:57,741 --> 00:35:58,761
it's all happening up there.

663
00:35:59,801 --> 00:36:02,862
Because I'm inclined to agree with this sentiment right here.

664
00:36:03,622 --> 00:36:06,783
And we actually don't have any dancing bears.

665
00:36:06,863 --> 00:36:10,763
There's no Sultan of Zanzibar, there's no caravan.

666
00:36:11,751 --> 00:36:14,494
But by going with the flow, we've saved ourselves

667
00:36:14,794 --> 00:36:16,836
millions of dollars in not having to create all these

668
00:36:17,577 --> 00:36:20,079
models and textures and assets and all this kind of stuff

669
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:23,703
because the player wants to believe this.

670
00:36:24,043 --> 00:36:28,147
And all we have done is basically put up a text box.

671
00:36:28,867 --> 00:36:32,651
Now that allows us to save our resources,

672
00:36:32,751 --> 00:36:33,592
our time, our energy.

673
00:36:34,320 --> 00:36:36,382
for the things that are kind of harder to sell,

674
00:36:36,402 --> 00:36:38,463
the things that the player might not be so inclined

675
00:36:38,483 --> 00:36:40,104
to believe or kind of want to see

676
00:36:41,245 --> 00:36:45,187
brought to life with all sorts of cool graphical stuff.

677
00:36:49,129 --> 00:36:51,431
Another technique for saving millions and millions of dollars

678
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,733
in designing games is to use,

679
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,154
take advantage of what the player already knows.

680
00:36:59,205 --> 00:37:02,646
players bring lots of their own information to games and they

681
00:37:02,666 --> 00:37:06,347
don't have to, a lot of that doesn't have to be reinforced

682
00:37:06,727 --> 00:37:12,009
literally. Pirates for example, a game where people bring a lot

683
00:37:12,129 --> 00:37:18,691
of their own knowledge to the game. So if they see a swordsman

684
00:37:18,711 --> 00:37:22,052
with a black curly mustache, they probably know that's going

685
00:37:22,072 --> 00:37:22,632
to be the evil.

686
00:37:24,132 --> 00:37:27,415
meta villain that they're going to have to sword fight and we

687
00:37:27,435 --> 00:37:31,478
don't need a whole lot of back story to explain how he got that

688
00:37:31,518 --> 00:37:34,300
way and what his childhood was like, et cetera, et cetera.

689
00:37:35,721 --> 00:37:39,304
Black curly mustache, okay, bad guy, time for a sword fight.

690
00:37:40,504 --> 00:37:42,666
Millions of dollars saved in back story.

691
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:48,030
So these are just a couple of techniques by which you can

692
00:37:48,070 --> 00:37:50,752
kind of focus, I think, your energy and your resources on.

693
00:37:51,881 --> 00:37:54,603
what's going to be really impressive, what's going to be new,

694
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:56,785
and what's going to be hard to sell in the game,

695
00:37:56,805 --> 00:37:59,668
and take advantage of things that the players

696
00:37:59,688 --> 00:38:02,270
are going to almost automatically provide

697
00:38:03,772 --> 00:38:05,553
through their own imagination.

698
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:12,513
Let's talk about artificial intelligence for a moment.

699
00:38:13,654 --> 00:38:17,317
AI is often a place where psychology

700
00:38:17,357 --> 00:38:19,919
really comes strongly into play,

701
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:23,842
because the AI kind of represents your opponent, the enemy.

702
00:38:23,862 --> 00:38:26,725
And whenever you're in a kind of conflict situation,

703
00:38:27,746 --> 00:38:31,869
your psychological juices are flowing even more strongly.

704
00:38:32,050 --> 00:38:36,373
You're really committed and invested in that conflict.

705
00:38:37,024 --> 00:38:42,885
And so a lot of players project a lot onto the AI

706
00:38:42,925 --> 00:38:44,905
because they feel this competitive situation.

707
00:38:45,506 --> 00:38:47,946
And there's a number of different philosophies about AI.

708
00:38:51,727 --> 00:38:53,548
My point of view is not necessarily the only point of view.

709
00:38:53,588 --> 00:38:55,688
There may be other points of view,

710
00:38:55,728 --> 00:38:59,529
but I look at AI as one element

711
00:38:59,589 --> 00:39:03,050
in creating an integrated overall experience for the player.

712
00:39:05,848 --> 00:39:08,774
in a single player game, like most of the games we're talking about,

713
00:39:10,196 --> 00:39:15,646
again, the key, the star of the game, the key experience is the experience that the player is having.

714
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:20,751
And so AI is kind of a tool to craft that experience,

715
00:39:20,791 --> 00:39:25,373
to customize it, to make it seem even more real

716
00:39:25,393 --> 00:39:25,933
to the player.

717
00:39:27,153 --> 00:39:28,874
There's another point of view, which is that the AI

718
00:39:28,914 --> 00:39:31,235
should act like another player, another person,

719
00:39:31,275 --> 00:39:33,256
should have human-ish characteristics

720
00:39:33,336 --> 00:39:34,536
and should feel like another player.

721
00:39:36,197 --> 00:39:38,539
I don't actually subscribe to that philosophy.

722
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:40,521
There's a couple things that I've seen

723
00:39:40,541 --> 00:39:42,463
that make me shy away from that.

724
00:39:42,503 --> 00:39:44,204
I'm not saying it's absolutely the wrong idea,

725
00:39:44,845 --> 00:39:50,609
but in my experience, if an AI has human characteristics,

726
00:39:51,250 --> 00:39:55,493
one thing we talk about is, I want it to surprise me.

727
00:39:55,533 --> 00:39:56,875
I want it to be tricky and clever.

728
00:39:58,578 --> 00:40:01,900
No, I don't think, when AI does that,

729
00:40:02,140 --> 00:40:05,821
most players feel that it's being stupid,

730
00:40:06,281 --> 00:40:10,383
it's being, it's dumb, because there's a fine line

731
00:40:10,423 --> 00:40:14,505
between clever and dumb, and the player is inclined

732
00:40:14,585 --> 00:40:17,006
to see the AI as being dumb.

733
00:40:18,506 --> 00:40:21,147
If the player, if the AI does something really brilliant,

734
00:40:22,228 --> 00:40:25,154
the player will assume that the AI peeked behind the scenes

735
00:40:25,194 --> 00:40:27,559
and looked at my numbers and looked where my stuff was

736
00:40:27,660 --> 00:40:29,704
and cheated, basically.

737
00:40:31,107 --> 00:40:32,991
So there's a lot of kind of psychological.

738
00:40:35,067 --> 00:40:39,151
stuff that goes on if the AI acts in ways that are

739
00:40:39,211 --> 00:40:41,012
kind of out of the norm.

740
00:40:41,273 --> 00:40:45,036
And they generally lead to the player kind of jumping out,

741
00:40:45,657 --> 00:40:47,458
losing that suspension of disbelief and trying,

742
00:40:47,598 --> 00:40:52,623
and kind of blaming the AI for what's going on in the game.

743
00:40:52,703 --> 00:41:00,329
So the way that I approach AI is to make it almost a metric,

744
00:41:00,630 --> 00:41:01,170
kind of a solid,

745
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,940
competition against which you play,

746
00:41:05,581 --> 00:41:07,962
but which you can kind of feel

747
00:41:08,162 --> 00:41:10,803
and your advancement as you go on.

748
00:41:10,903 --> 00:41:13,183
You get this real sense of progress.

749
00:41:13,223 --> 00:41:14,744
There's this improvement metric

750
00:41:14,764 --> 00:41:16,445
that the AI is kind of predictable,

751
00:41:16,965 --> 00:41:18,345
kind of solid and steady,

752
00:41:18,365 --> 00:41:20,986
and you're the one doing the brilliant things

753
00:41:21,026 --> 00:41:23,447
and the clever things and getting better and better

754
00:41:23,727 --> 00:41:24,327
versus the AI.

755
00:41:25,708 --> 00:41:28,629
Another thing that AI can do is give you feedback

756
00:41:29,009 --> 00:41:31,329
when you're talking to the leaders in civilization.

757
00:41:31,770 --> 00:41:34,430
They often comment upon what you're doing

758
00:41:34,470 --> 00:41:35,871
and how, you know, whether it's good or bad

759
00:41:35,911 --> 00:41:36,951
or whether they like it or don't like it.

760
00:41:38,291 --> 00:41:39,992
When we're playing a single player game,

761
00:41:41,212 --> 00:41:45,313
kind of feedback validation is really important

762
00:41:45,533 --> 00:41:46,553
because you're kind of.

763
00:41:46,694 --> 00:41:49,576
the only person there, and these AI characters

764
00:41:49,636 --> 00:41:51,638
are kind of your only friends at that point in time.

765
00:41:51,718 --> 00:41:53,319
So having them acknowledge what you're doing,

766
00:41:53,339 --> 00:41:56,001
be aware of it, is really validating for the player,

767
00:41:56,021 --> 00:41:59,284
and is something we found in Civil Revolution

768
00:41:59,324 --> 00:42:03,288
was really important, that the more that the other leaders

769
00:42:03,328 --> 00:42:05,409
in the game kind of reflected on what you were doing

770
00:42:05,449 --> 00:42:07,471
and reacted, the more the player felt that

771
00:42:09,513 --> 00:42:10,753
but somebody understood them, you know,

772
00:42:10,773 --> 00:42:12,754
kind of, you know what I'm going through.

773
00:42:13,735 --> 00:42:16,276
And they weren't just kind of playing in a vacuum,

774
00:42:16,296 --> 00:42:19,498
they were playing in a interesting world.

775
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:23,800
Okay.

776
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:27,762
I talked a little bit earlier

777
00:42:27,822 --> 00:42:29,623
about self-destructive behavior.

778
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:35,025
Ways that the player actually can damage

779
00:42:35,165 --> 00:42:36,486
their gameplay experience.

780
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:41,734
And one of the responsibilities that I think we have

781
00:42:41,774 --> 00:42:45,236
as designers is to protect the player from themselves.

782
00:42:45,856 --> 00:42:47,957
And there are a couple of places where this

783
00:42:47,977 --> 00:42:48,877
really becomes an issue.

784
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:52,798
One is how do you handle the idea of load and save?

785
00:42:54,219 --> 00:42:56,159
I've watched people play Civilization

786
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:00,001
where before every battle, they save the game.

787
00:43:00,021 --> 00:43:02,982
If they don't win, they reload that saved game,

788
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:06,163
play the battle again, save it, until they win the game.

789
00:43:06,968 --> 00:43:10,029
To me, that's not really playing the game that I designed.

790
00:43:10,049 --> 00:43:13,510
That's not the experience that I think is most interesting.

791
00:43:13,550 --> 00:43:16,292
It really doesn't require you to have a flexible strategy.

792
00:43:16,752 --> 00:43:19,773
It doesn't kind of require you to think ahead.

793
00:43:19,813 --> 00:43:21,134
If you know you're going to win every battle,

794
00:43:21,194 --> 00:43:22,774
the game, I think, is a lot less fun.

795
00:43:24,275 --> 00:43:25,515
So in Civilization Revolution,

796
00:43:25,575 --> 00:43:29,777
we actually save the random number with the save file,

797
00:43:29,797 --> 00:43:31,498
so that if you reload the save file,

798
00:43:32,118 --> 00:43:33,538
you get the same result in your battle.

799
00:43:33,879 --> 00:43:35,399
You know, ha ha ha.

800
00:43:35,419 --> 00:43:36,500
You know, that'll teach you.

801
00:43:37,366 --> 00:43:38,828
I guess people did find a way to get around that,

802
00:43:38,868 --> 00:43:43,773
but by providing the player perhaps too easy access

803
00:43:43,793 --> 00:43:46,215
to loading and saving, you may actually be

804
00:43:46,696 --> 00:43:48,298
diminishing the experience for the player,

805
00:43:48,318 --> 00:43:50,740
and that is something to think about in game design.

806
00:43:51,821 --> 00:43:54,785
In Pirates, we actually only allow you to load

807
00:43:54,825 --> 00:43:56,186
and save the game when you're in a port.

808
00:43:58,408 --> 00:44:02,311
As you voyage around, you need to live with the consequences

809
00:44:02,371 --> 00:44:03,452
of that voyage.

810
00:44:05,314 --> 00:44:07,696
And kind of by building it into the fantasy of the game,

811
00:44:07,716 --> 00:44:11,119
I think it's a little less obvious that we are trying to

812
00:44:12,100 --> 00:44:14,082
kind of control your load-save behavior,

813
00:44:14,102 --> 00:44:15,183
but that's something to think about,

814
00:44:15,243 --> 00:44:17,925
is finding ways to build your load-save restrictions

815
00:44:17,965 --> 00:44:21,809
kind of into the fantasy, the story of the game.

816
00:44:26,014 --> 00:44:29,697
Another area where I think we can damage the gameplay

817
00:44:29,717 --> 00:44:33,541
experience for the player is in providing them too many options,

818
00:44:33,641 --> 00:44:37,065
settings, things that they can kind of customize in the middle

819
00:44:37,085 --> 00:44:41,890
of the game. There's all sorts of good things that the player

820
00:44:41,910 --> 00:44:44,733
should be able to customize, whether you think the joystick

821
00:44:44,753 --> 00:44:47,315
works this way, whether you're left-handed or right-handed. All

822
00:44:47,355 --> 00:44:48,236
those things are key.

823
00:44:48,979 --> 00:44:51,760
But there's been a tendency that I think has kind of

824
00:44:51,820 --> 00:44:55,221
gone away more recently, but to kind of open up

825
00:44:55,661 --> 00:44:58,582
all sorts of game play decisions to the player.

826
00:44:59,302 --> 00:45:02,143
And to me, you know, that's kind of wrong.

827
00:45:02,203 --> 00:45:04,463
We're, as designers, we're here to make the game

828
00:45:05,284 --> 00:45:06,844
and not to kind of hand it over to the player and say,

829
00:45:06,864 --> 00:45:08,224
you know, I'm not sure how this game should work.

830
00:45:08,304 --> 00:45:09,525
You know, you figure it out.

831
00:45:10,125 --> 00:45:13,026
So, kind of being careful with the types of things

832
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:18,147
that you open up to player is one thing to think about.

833
00:45:20,051 --> 00:45:21,452
Another is cheat codes.

834
00:45:21,572 --> 00:45:25,634
Again, I think it's a way that players can

835
00:45:25,674 --> 00:45:28,675
actually damage the gameplay experience for themselves.

836
00:45:29,715 --> 00:45:33,257
I remember when we were working on Civilization II,

837
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:36,919
Brian Reynolds brought the game and I looked at it

838
00:45:37,039 --> 00:45:39,920
and there on the main menu was cheat.

839
00:45:40,681 --> 00:45:43,822
It was like play a quick game, play a random map,

840
00:45:43,902 --> 00:45:44,983
play a game, cheat.

841
00:45:45,904 --> 00:45:48,727
And I said, you know, Brian Cheek, on the main menu?

842
00:45:48,767 --> 00:45:50,809
He said, yeah, it's cool, you know,

843
00:45:50,829 --> 00:45:53,311
you can bring in tanks in the Middle Ages

844
00:45:53,391 --> 00:45:55,893
and run over people, and you know, it's cool.

845
00:45:55,993 --> 00:45:58,836
And I don't disagree that it is cool.

846
00:45:59,317 --> 00:46:01,679
In fact, I watched my son when he was playing,

847
00:46:01,699 --> 00:46:04,682
you know, have a wonderful time bringing in all these tanks

848
00:46:04,702 --> 00:46:08,785
and running roughshod over the pikemen of the Middle Ages.

849
00:46:09,960 --> 00:46:12,401
It's like, but Brian, does the main menu,

850
00:46:12,601 --> 00:46:15,222
can't we just vary it one or two levels deeper?

851
00:46:15,242 --> 00:46:18,243
Because I kind of want the players to play the real game

852
00:46:18,303 --> 00:46:20,804
first before they start experimenting with the cheats

853
00:46:20,864 --> 00:46:22,745
and the Easter eggs and things like that.

854
00:46:26,386 --> 00:46:29,467
The good news is that this cheating idea

855
00:46:29,587 --> 00:46:32,268
actually led directly to the idea of modding.

856
00:46:33,449 --> 00:46:34,530
which is very powerful.

857
00:46:35,271 --> 00:46:40,057
Certainly, Civilization II was a breakthrough for civilization

858
00:46:40,157 --> 00:46:44,383
and added an incredible amount of variety and energy to the Civilization series.

859
00:46:44,403 --> 00:46:46,846
This is a picture from Fall from Heaven.

860
00:46:50,577 --> 00:46:53,418
There's a happy ending to the story of Cheat.

861
00:46:54,178 --> 00:46:57,659
And modding has been a very cool addition,

862
00:46:57,979 --> 00:47:01,640
kind of allowing players to exercise their inner designer

863
00:47:01,820 --> 00:47:04,621
and become part of the community process.

864
00:47:05,221 --> 00:47:08,382
So, cheating, I'm not so sure,

865
00:47:08,422 --> 00:47:10,583
but modding is definitely a cool thing.

866
00:47:14,702 --> 00:47:17,645
Another kind of psychological skill I think that we need

867
00:47:17,665 --> 00:47:22,169
to develop as designers is listening to the player.

868
00:47:23,270 --> 00:47:25,552
I'm kind of assuming at this point that you've bought into

869
00:47:25,572 --> 00:47:30,536
the idea that game design is an iterative process,

870
00:47:30,576 --> 00:47:32,638
starting with a prototype and kind of building on that,

871
00:47:33,398 --> 00:47:35,380
getting a lot of play, getting a lot of feedback,

872
00:47:37,262 --> 00:47:40,604
building a game over time, and if you do that,

873
00:47:40,985 --> 00:47:42,906
you're gonna spend a lot of time talking to.

874
00:47:43,789 --> 00:47:45,410
the players, the people that are playing your game,

875
00:47:45,470 --> 00:47:48,493
getting their feedback, and taking advantage of that

876
00:47:48,553 --> 00:47:49,434
to make your game better.

877
00:47:51,436 --> 00:47:53,638
But what I found in that process is that

878
00:47:54,379 --> 00:47:57,982
it's really not that useful to kind of take literally

879
00:47:58,743 --> 00:48:00,625
what your players are saying to you.

880
00:48:01,986 --> 00:48:05,670
There are different kind of ways

881
00:48:05,690 --> 00:48:08,252
that players will react to the game.

882
00:48:10,074 --> 00:48:11,876
One is to kind of provide you with solutions.

883
00:48:12,256 --> 00:48:14,557
You know, I think you should take this out.

884
00:48:14,577 --> 00:48:15,678
I think you should change this.

885
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:18,660
I think this should work this way.

886
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:23,404
Occasionally that's useful, but a lot of times that really

887
00:48:23,424 --> 00:48:26,066
doesn't take into account other parts of the game

888
00:48:26,106 --> 00:48:27,527
that that would break, et cetera, et cetera.

889
00:48:28,007 --> 00:48:29,588
And it's tempting to kind of discard that.

890
00:48:29,628 --> 00:48:30,649
You know, that's not going to work.

891
00:48:30,669 --> 00:48:31,469
I know that's not going to work.

892
00:48:31,530 --> 00:48:32,530
You might have even tried that.

893
00:48:34,170 --> 00:48:36,111
But I think it's important as a designer

894
00:48:36,131 --> 00:48:38,152
to get some real value out of that,

895
00:48:38,573 --> 00:48:41,375
to drill down to what is motivating that solution.

896
00:48:41,415 --> 00:48:42,475
What is wrong?

897
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,257
What is the kind of thing that the player's feeling

898
00:48:45,277 --> 00:48:46,798
or doing that is unsatisfying

899
00:48:47,159 --> 00:48:49,460
that leads them to kind of suggest the solution?

900
00:48:49,860 --> 00:48:51,902
And a lot of times, you can find something

901
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:55,044
that is consistent with your game design

902
00:48:55,064 --> 00:48:57,706
and your game ideas that will solve that problem for them.

903
00:48:57,766 --> 00:48:59,787
It might not be the exact solution that they propose,

904
00:49:00,107 --> 00:49:02,489
but it will solve the problem in everybody.

905
00:49:03,089 --> 00:49:03,750
Everybody's happy.

906
00:49:05,372 --> 00:49:08,936
Another type of comment that you might get back

907
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,598
is kind of the opposite of that.

908
00:49:10,938 --> 00:49:11,879
It's an emotion, you know.

909
00:49:12,380 --> 00:49:13,180
It doesn't feel right.

910
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:17,185
I'm frustrated, I'm confused.

911
00:49:17,645 --> 00:49:19,087
Again, very little information.

912
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:24,189
And again, it's kind of our job as designers

913
00:49:24,229 --> 00:49:27,631
to figure out what is it that's causing that emotion?

914
00:49:28,192 --> 00:49:31,974
What can I change to make that emotion go away

915
00:49:31,994 --> 00:49:33,975
if it's a bad emotion or to strengthen that

916
00:49:34,796 --> 00:49:37,377
if it's a positive emotion?

917
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:42,801
Another important, oops, don't look at that slide.

918
00:49:46,225 --> 00:49:47,746
The last thing I think is important about talking

919
00:49:47,766 --> 00:49:50,989
to your players is knowing their individual personalities.

920
00:49:52,170 --> 00:49:55,293
A lot of times, it's very helpful in deciphering,

921
00:49:55,333 --> 00:49:58,076
decoding what they're saying, because a certain player

922
00:49:58,977 --> 00:50:00,658
might not like that type of game

923
00:50:00,678 --> 00:50:01,759
and is never going to be happy.

924
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:06,944
There are certain players we call Mr. Anecdotal,

925
00:50:07,785 --> 00:50:09,547
who will be convinced something has happened.

926
00:50:10,466 --> 00:50:11,767
that you know is impossible,

927
00:50:12,548 --> 00:50:14,830
we'll just kind of harp on that one thing that,

928
00:50:15,110 --> 00:50:17,452
there are people that are very generous,

929
00:50:17,813 --> 00:50:19,654
kind of afraid to say anything bad about the game,

930
00:50:19,674 --> 00:50:20,675
you almost have to force them,

931
00:50:21,096 --> 00:50:22,397
I know you hated something about it,

932
00:50:22,457 --> 00:50:24,078
come, tell me, tell me what it is.

933
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:28,806
So kind of knowing the personalities of your players

934
00:50:29,767 --> 00:50:31,548
is important in, again, in deciphering

935
00:50:32,990 --> 00:50:34,171
what they're really trying to tell you.

936
00:50:34,752 --> 00:50:37,835
And kind of really tapping into this resource,

937
00:50:37,895 --> 00:50:39,256
which is really invaluable,

938
00:50:39,897 --> 00:50:41,859
the gameplay experience of your testers

939
00:50:41,959 --> 00:50:42,840
as you're playing the game.

940
00:50:44,321 --> 00:50:46,523
So what is the point of all this, you might be asking?

941
00:50:49,556 --> 00:50:51,897
I'd kind of like to wrap it up with this idea of

942
00:50:52,477 --> 00:50:53,317
the epic journey.

943
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:55,578
I think this is what we're trying to create for the player,

944
00:50:55,678 --> 00:50:57,539
is an epic journey.

945
00:50:57,559 --> 00:51:00,680
I think I should trademark this one too.

946
00:51:00,880 --> 00:51:01,420
Epic journey.

947
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:05,442
Keep that in.

948
00:51:05,582 --> 00:51:07,382
There's so many genres, so many styles of games,

949
00:51:07,402 --> 00:51:09,083
so many different ways of gaming.

950
00:51:09,723 --> 00:51:12,784
But I think in a way, they can kind of all be encapsulated

951
00:51:12,864 --> 00:51:15,105
in this idea of an epic journey.

952
00:51:16,015 --> 00:51:20,980
And how do we use psychology to make our journey more epic

953
00:51:21,460 --> 00:51:23,742
and our epic more journey-like?

954
00:51:25,144 --> 00:51:25,764
You might be asking.

955
00:51:27,085 --> 00:51:28,106
Here are a couple of tools

956
00:51:29,508 --> 00:51:30,669
that we have to make that happen.

957
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:33,512
I come back again and again

958
00:51:33,652 --> 00:51:35,333
to the idea of interesting decisions.

959
00:51:36,722 --> 00:51:41,185
That's really the core, the basic fundamental pieces

960
00:51:41,285 --> 00:51:43,187
of your game are these decisions

961
00:51:43,227 --> 00:51:44,228
that you're giving the player.

962
00:51:44,949 --> 00:51:49,192
And the journey is the process of exploring

963
00:51:49,232 --> 00:51:51,434
all these decisions and seeing how they relate

964
00:51:51,454 --> 00:51:53,676
to each other and playing through them.

965
00:51:54,336 --> 00:51:58,099
So think about the decisions that you're giving your player.

966
00:51:59,947 --> 00:52:02,788
Are they ones that encourage them to project,

967
00:52:02,848 --> 00:52:03,749
to think into the future?

968
00:52:03,769 --> 00:52:05,269
You know, if I do this, what is going to happen?

969
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:09,491
Do they have interesting, kind of not taken paths?

970
00:52:09,851 --> 00:52:11,972
And the coolest decisions are the ones where

971
00:52:12,352 --> 00:52:14,653
the player chooses path A, but they're kind of saying,

972
00:52:14,673 --> 00:52:16,554
well, next time, you know, that path B

973
00:52:16,574 --> 00:52:18,995
looks kind of interesting, too, so I'm going to play

974
00:52:19,035 --> 00:52:20,275
next time and try that other path.

975
00:52:20,675 --> 00:52:22,356
Those are the really powerful decisions.

976
00:52:22,416 --> 00:52:24,337
If you can build them into your game,

977
00:52:25,017 --> 00:52:27,718
you're well on your way to creating.

978
00:52:28,537 --> 00:52:30,379
The epic journey.

979
00:52:35,062 --> 00:52:35,963
Learning and progress.

980
00:52:37,804 --> 00:52:39,746
This is fundamental to the journey.

981
00:52:40,226 --> 00:52:43,168
The idea that you are constantly progressing,

982
00:52:43,208 --> 00:52:47,071
you're constantly at a better place than you were before,

983
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,253
you're smarter than you were before, you're more powerful.

984
00:52:50,034 --> 00:52:51,675
It's kind of fundamental,

985
00:52:51,715 --> 00:52:53,096
but it's easy to lose track of this.

986
00:52:53,136 --> 00:52:54,577
I think that you cannot...

987
00:52:55,758 --> 00:52:58,780
reward and acknowledge and reflect this progress

988
00:52:58,820 --> 00:52:59,901
too much in a game.

989
00:52:59,921 --> 00:53:01,923
It's very important for the player to know

990
00:53:02,663 --> 00:53:06,726
how they're doing, what value has this last half hour,

991
00:53:06,746 --> 00:53:09,949
this last hour been to me in terms of playing.

992
00:53:09,969 --> 00:53:13,692
I think World of Warcraft does a great job of this.

993
00:53:14,312 --> 00:53:16,494
The level system makes it very clear

994
00:53:17,414 --> 00:53:18,495
the kind of progress you made,

995
00:53:18,515 --> 00:53:20,557
and their ways of building this idea,

996
00:53:21,037 --> 00:53:24,040
which is very powerful, into your game.

997
00:53:25,580 --> 00:53:29,748
One more turn, this is another way of making the journey epic.

998
00:53:32,176 --> 00:53:34,657
It's a concept that we relate back to civilization,

999
00:53:34,697 --> 00:53:36,837
but it applies to almost every game.

1000
00:53:37,417 --> 00:53:39,158
The idea that the player is constantly

1001
00:53:39,198 --> 00:53:40,318
kind of leaning forward.

1002
00:53:40,698 --> 00:53:42,979
They're anticipating things that are going to happen later.

1003
00:53:43,039 --> 00:53:45,620
They're looking forward to their plans coming together.

1004
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,540
They're wondering what's around the next corner.

1005
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:52,082
You can foreshadow, you can kind of just let people know

1006
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:53,902
that cool stuff is going to happen soon.

1007
00:53:53,922 --> 00:53:55,963
And it draws them very much into this

1008
00:53:56,683 --> 00:53:57,803
one more turn phenomenon.

1009
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:02,907
And it kind of all comes back to this idea of replayability.

1010
00:54:02,987 --> 00:54:05,829
That if you create a fantastic journey,

1011
00:54:05,849 --> 00:54:08,810
and the player comes to the end of that journey,

1012
00:54:09,551 --> 00:54:13,233
they suddenly realize that this is only one segment

1013
00:54:13,493 --> 00:54:14,673
of this epic journey.

1014
00:54:15,154 --> 00:54:17,855
This journey is much more epic than they even thought,

1015
00:54:18,415 --> 00:54:20,156
because this has only been a part.

1016
00:54:20,176 --> 00:54:21,217
The epic was a part.

1017
00:54:21,237 --> 00:54:22,998
It's like epic squared or epic cubed.

1018
00:54:27,314 --> 00:54:29,555
And replayability kind of plants that seed

1019
00:54:30,035 --> 00:54:32,396
and makes that happen for your game.

1020
00:54:32,496 --> 00:54:35,017
So these are some tools, some psychological tools

1021
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:41,500
that make your game the coolest epic journey of all time.

1022
00:54:43,721 --> 00:54:45,401
So now you know everything.

1023
00:54:47,182 --> 00:54:47,422
Thank you.

1024
00:55:05,182 --> 00:55:08,905
We have a little bit of time for questions. There are some folks

1025
00:55:08,985 --> 00:55:14,129
with microphones. I'm sure much of what I've said is wrong and

1026
00:55:14,149 --> 00:55:17,771
you're going to correct me on it. But I'd be happy to take

1027
00:55:17,811 --> 00:55:23,215
any questions or thoughts. If there's anybody who would like

1028
00:55:23,236 --> 00:55:27,499
to ask a question. Look for someone with a green, raise your

1029
00:55:27,519 --> 00:55:30,821
hand and look for somebody with a green shirt and a microphone.

1030
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:33,183
Right here.

1031
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:41,672
What do you normally tell your animators, designers, artists,

1032
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:46,637
exactly how you want the art for particular games to feel?

1033
00:55:46,658 --> 00:55:48,279
How do you explain to them what you have in your vision?

1034
00:55:53,205 --> 00:55:56,187
The question is, how do I explain to animators and artists

1035
00:55:56,407 --> 00:55:58,127
what my vision is, what I want them to do?

1036
00:55:58,147 --> 00:56:00,488
There's a couple dimensions to that.

1037
00:56:00,508 --> 00:56:03,589
A lot of times, I will actually build a prototype myself

1038
00:56:03,750 --> 00:56:06,911
using pieces from other games and things like that

1039
00:56:06,931 --> 00:56:09,372
that kind of create the big picture

1040
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:15,494
so they know what they're doing fits into the bigger picture.

1041
00:56:15,514 --> 00:56:17,115
One of the issues, I think, with art

1042
00:56:17,155 --> 00:56:19,736
is often it's easy to get kind of a keyhole

1043
00:56:19,776 --> 00:56:21,676
and only focus on the one thing that you're making.

1044
00:56:23,521 --> 00:56:24,843
The other thing that I think is important

1045
00:56:24,883 --> 00:56:28,067
is to kind of let your artists be artists, be creative.

1046
00:56:30,691 --> 00:56:32,514
Put a pretty big box around what you want

1047
00:56:33,014 --> 00:56:34,536
and let them surprise you with something

1048
00:56:34,556 --> 00:56:36,579
that's even cooler than you imagined.

1049
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,541
So one is having a prototype that they can always go back to

1050
00:56:40,602 --> 00:56:42,883
if the question is how does this fit into the game?

1051
00:56:43,203 --> 00:56:44,083
What is it supposed to do?

1052
00:56:44,103 --> 00:56:47,265
But then let them be artists.

1053
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:51,187
I think that games as a collaborative medium

1054
00:56:52,087 --> 00:56:53,748
really need to take advantage of all the talents

1055
00:56:53,768 --> 00:56:55,689
that you have available to work on it.

1056
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:59,331
So I try to let the artists be as creative as they can be.

1057
00:56:59,351 --> 00:57:00,111
Question, here?

1058
00:57:00,131 --> 00:57:00,191
Hi.

1059
00:57:07,690 --> 00:57:14,223
You talked about player egoism and that sort of approach to that players come come to approach games with

1060
00:57:14,784 --> 00:57:18,551
And I guess I'm having a hard time like figuring out like do you think that?

1061
00:57:20,114 --> 00:57:25,019
you know this egoistic approach to games is kind of prefigured by the themes that

1062
00:57:25,459 --> 00:57:29,163
that you give them like you know you're going to build a civilization you're going to become

1063
00:57:29,203 --> 00:57:34,608
a railroad tycoon or do you sort of pick these themes because you anticipate that this is what

1064
00:57:34,668 --> 00:57:38,491
players like how players want to feel with when they play a game?

1065
00:57:40,163 --> 00:57:43,526
I think one of the fundamental attractions of gaming

1066
00:57:43,646 --> 00:57:47,208
is that you can go to places that you can't go in real life,

1067
00:57:47,649 --> 00:57:50,210
that you can inhabit characters that you probably

1068
00:57:50,230 --> 00:57:52,052
don't have the opportunity to do in real life.

1069
00:57:52,652 --> 00:57:54,914
And I think it's kind of the Walter Mitty fantasy.

1070
00:57:55,214 --> 00:57:58,676
I get to be a dashing, swashbuckling pirate.

1071
00:57:58,836 --> 00:58:00,558
I get to run a great civilization.

1072
00:58:01,218 --> 00:58:04,681
So we definitely look for topics that are epic,

1073
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:07,984
that are big, that kind of really empower the player

1074
00:58:08,024 --> 00:58:09,385
and make them much larger than life,

1075
00:58:09,446 --> 00:58:11,728
because I think that's what you're looking for

1076
00:58:11,808 --> 00:58:12,969
in a gameplay experience,

1077
00:58:13,129 --> 00:58:14,650
is something to kind of take you out of.

1078
00:58:15,633 --> 00:58:18,154
the real world and into a cooler world.

1079
00:58:18,234 --> 00:58:20,475
Take you out of your real life into a cooler life,

1080
00:58:20,535 --> 00:58:23,116
take you out of maybe your real character

1081
00:58:23,136 --> 00:58:24,616
into a cooler character.

1082
00:58:26,557 --> 00:58:29,118
Epic is definitely part of our thinking

1083
00:58:29,198 --> 00:58:30,638
in putting together these game worlds

1084
00:58:30,698 --> 00:58:33,839
because they are, I think at the end of the day,

1085
00:58:34,500 --> 00:58:36,680
that journey just feels cooler

1086
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:38,741
if it's been through thousands of years of history.

1087
00:58:40,884 --> 00:58:43,186
through the high of the Spanish main,

1088
00:58:43,406 --> 00:58:47,648
ending up with that horribly evil guy with a mustache,

1089
00:58:47,688 --> 00:58:48,448
you know, et cetera.

1090
00:58:48,488 --> 00:58:50,870
So yes, we definitely choose kind of epic,

1091
00:58:51,430 --> 00:58:52,711
larger than life situations,

1092
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:55,572
because I think it makes a more compelling game,

1093
00:58:55,932 --> 00:58:59,814
and it also taps into a lot of common knowledge and fantasy,

1094
00:59:00,054 --> 00:59:02,696
which we can then use in building the game.

1095
00:59:05,777 --> 00:59:06,398
Question over here?

1096
00:59:07,628 --> 00:59:12,130
Hey, with the limited amount of time that people have to play games like as an adult,

1097
00:59:12,250 --> 00:59:17,593
wouldn't it make more sense to make a single epic journey rather than having to play through it like

1098
00:59:17,633 --> 00:59:28,118
two to the n times? I think people appreciate the value of replayability. I mean there's sequels

1099
00:59:28,178 --> 00:59:33,100
out there. So if you had a great experience with a game, you often want to do it again.

1100
00:59:34,321 --> 00:59:38,543
I don't think people, people do have a limited amount of time

1101
00:59:38,563 --> 00:59:40,884
to play games, but I think they select what games they want

1102
00:59:40,904 --> 00:59:43,405
to play in that limited amount of time,

1103
00:59:43,485 --> 00:59:45,906
and it's even more important for that reason

1104
00:59:45,926 --> 00:59:47,387
that they're playing a game that they like.

1105
00:59:47,987 --> 00:59:50,228
So replayability kind of allows you to play a game

1106
00:59:50,248 --> 00:59:51,268
that you know you're going to like

1107
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:54,350
with that limited amount of time that you have.

1108
01:00:00,670 --> 01:00:04,454
Hello. I have a question about the flight simulator point you

1109
01:00:04,474 --> 01:00:08,057
made earlier. I've worked on racing games for a while. And

1110
01:00:08,157 --> 01:00:10,799
the last one we released was Midnight Club 4 last year, which

1111
01:00:10,999 --> 01:00:14,262
critically got slammed because everybody thought it was too

1112
01:00:14,322 --> 01:00:17,484
hard. And we worked really hard to make it so you didn't have to

1113
01:00:17,524 --> 01:00:20,907
win to progress and succeed in the game. But the conception was

1114
01:00:20,947 --> 01:00:22,989
that people were really, really frustrated when they weren't

1115
01:00:23,049 --> 01:00:25,631
coming in first all the time. And I was wondering if you had

1116
01:00:25,671 --> 01:00:28,253
any advice or solutions for trying to condition the player

1117
01:00:28,273 --> 01:00:29,454
to accept that they're not going to win.

1118
01:00:30,135 --> 01:00:30,555
all the time.

1119
01:00:31,636 --> 01:00:33,818
You're definitely walking uphill there,

1120
01:00:34,278 --> 01:00:37,040
walking into the wind, I think the expectation

1121
01:00:37,100 --> 01:00:39,122
is out there that you're going to win.

1122
01:00:39,162 --> 01:00:40,823
I think you have to do a lot of work

1123
01:00:40,903 --> 01:00:44,466
to make it fun not to win.

1124
01:00:45,667 --> 01:00:49,510
Certainly realism and authenticity are cool things.

1125
01:00:50,342 --> 01:00:56,226
but you have to work hard to sell that idea.

1126
01:00:56,246 --> 01:01:02,971
I'm a big Gran Turismo fan, but even that game,

1127
01:01:02,991 --> 01:01:06,333
I think you still end up winning very often,

1128
01:01:06,373 --> 01:01:11,577
even though it has the real feel of authenticity.

1129
01:01:13,979 --> 01:01:16,140
Good luck, but that's a tough one.

1130
01:01:19,986 --> 01:01:26,127
done. Over here. Hi, you were talking about how it's really

1131
01:01:26,147 --> 01:01:29,768
good to present the player with choices and when it comes to a

1132
01:01:29,808 --> 01:01:31,828
lot of games lately they've been doing a lot of the moral choices

1133
01:01:31,868 --> 01:01:35,329
like good or evil. Is it more positive to do that and have the

1134
01:01:35,349 --> 01:01:38,410
player expect a certain outcome or would you rather see games

1135
01:01:38,430 --> 01:01:40,690
start moving into the morally gray area where it's more

1136
01:01:40,770 --> 01:01:43,411
uncertain? That's a good question.

1137
01:01:44,631 --> 01:01:47,395
I'm not a fan of morally gray games.

1138
01:01:47,455 --> 01:01:51,640
I think that this alliance, this unholy alliance

1139
01:01:51,660 --> 01:01:53,022
that we made with the player, to me,

1140
01:01:54,424 --> 01:01:56,787
excludes that, unless you're very clear up front

1141
01:01:57,408 --> 01:02:00,332
that this is a game about gray moral choices.

1142
01:02:00,973 --> 01:02:04,477
because you're asking the player to invest this time.

1143
01:02:04,497 --> 01:02:07,881
One of the analogies I use is like

1144
01:02:08,321 --> 01:02:09,863
showing up on your first day at high school.

1145
01:02:10,184 --> 01:02:12,246
You're kind of wondering, what are the rules here?

1146
01:02:12,286 --> 01:02:13,768
Who are the cool people?

1147
01:02:14,248 --> 01:02:15,990
How does this place work?

1148
01:02:16,694 --> 01:02:18,895
And so you're kind of very vulnerable early in the game

1149
01:02:18,935 --> 01:02:21,275
and you want to kind of be encouraged

1150
01:02:21,775 --> 01:02:23,776
and kind of know that this time that you're investing

1151
01:02:23,796 --> 01:02:26,336
and spending is taking you down the right path.

1152
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:29,437
And the idea of the morally gray choices

1153
01:02:29,497 --> 01:02:31,477
and things like that, I think it always plants

1154
01:02:31,997 --> 01:02:33,458
the idea in the player's mind that,

1155
01:02:33,498 --> 01:02:35,378
I might be on the wrong track here.

1156
01:02:35,398 --> 01:02:36,778
All this time I'm investing now,

1157
01:02:37,159 --> 01:02:39,199
this might be just taking me off in the wrong direction.

1158
01:02:39,779 --> 01:02:42,460
And I think that's an opportunity for the player

1159
01:02:42,500 --> 01:02:44,980
to kind of say, you know, maybe I should try something else.

1160
01:02:45,060 --> 01:02:47,681
I think you have to be very clear if your game is about

1161
01:02:48,481 --> 01:02:50,402
morally gray, ambiguous choices,

1162
01:02:51,262 --> 01:02:55,963
that you're gonna make sure that wherever they go,

1163
01:02:56,203 --> 01:02:57,644
something interesting is gonna happen.

1164
01:02:58,104 --> 01:02:59,924
That they're not gonna be allowed to go off

1165
01:02:59,984 --> 01:03:01,665
on some dead-end path,

1166
01:03:02,245 --> 01:03:04,465
because they made a poor moral choice.

1167
01:03:08,807 --> 01:03:12,714
Given the number of trends that you have seen come and go during the course of your career,

1168
01:03:12,854 --> 01:03:17,042
what would you guess would be the next big trend in gaming?

1169
01:03:17,082 --> 01:03:20,969
Where do you see the avant-garde idea coming from in the future?

1170
01:03:22,820 --> 01:03:25,142
It's a really cool time, I think, to be a game designer.

1171
01:03:25,182 --> 01:03:28,965
We certainly have seen the indie games movement

1172
01:03:29,485 --> 01:03:32,367
put a lot of new energy into gaming.

1173
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:35,890
We have new platforms, whether it's Facebook

1174
01:03:36,310 --> 01:03:39,612
or the live or places, browser games,

1175
01:03:39,652 --> 01:03:43,435
a lot of places where the whole kind of big budget thing

1176
01:03:43,495 --> 01:03:46,797
has gone away and opened up a lot of new opportunities for.

1177
01:03:47,698 --> 01:03:50,101
for gaming, you know, where do I see gaming going?

1178
01:03:50,161 --> 01:03:52,685
I think this is the year of civilization, frankly.

1179
01:03:52,705 --> 01:03:52,745
Um.

1180
01:03:53,526 --> 01:03:53,666
Um.

1181
01:03:53,927 --> 01:03:54,007
Um.

1182
01:03:54,167 --> 01:03:54,227
Um.

1183
01:03:54,247 --> 01:03:54,347
Um.

1184
01:03:54,367 --> 01:03:57,211
Um.

1185
01:03:57,331 --> 01:03:57,632
Um.

1186
01:03:59,254 --> 01:03:59,354
Um.

1187
01:04:00,685 --> 01:04:03,347
I think there's a Civilization 5 maybe coming this year,

1188
01:04:03,467 --> 01:04:07,070
and a Civilization Network, so in the immediate future,

1189
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:08,671
I think this is the year of Civilization.

1190
01:04:10,252 --> 01:04:13,694
Looking further out, there's so much energy and dynamism,

1191
01:04:13,714 --> 01:04:16,816
I think, in this industry, that it's part of, I think,

1192
01:04:16,836 --> 01:04:20,318
what keeps us, every day, looking to see what's new,

1193
01:04:20,378 --> 01:04:22,259
and that's a big part of the excitement, I think,

1194
01:04:22,279 --> 01:04:23,760
of being part of this industry.

1195
01:04:26,481 --> 01:04:28,321
Over here.

1196
01:04:28,341 --> 01:04:29,182
Hi.

1197
01:04:29,282 --> 01:04:30,602
Throughout your presentation, you've

1198
01:04:30,622 --> 01:04:34,023
talked a lot about how people hate failure in video games

1199
01:04:34,643 --> 01:04:36,364
and avoid it.

1200
01:04:36,984 --> 01:04:39,204
I would like you to speak a little bit more

1201
01:04:39,244 --> 01:04:41,565
on how you can make a video game that just keeps getting

1202
01:04:42,045 --> 01:04:45,006
better and better, or if that is possible,

1203
01:04:45,026 --> 01:04:50,868
and how you personally avoid the feeling of losing or failure

1204
01:04:51,068 --> 01:04:51,768
in the video game.

1205
01:04:53,832 --> 01:04:58,318
I think almost every video game is built on the idea of progress.

1206
01:04:59,499 --> 01:05:02,984
Now that doesn't mean that progress is free or automatic or guaranteed,

1207
01:05:04,246 --> 01:05:09,513
but the player wants the basic experience to be one of getting better, learning, progressing.

1208
01:05:10,994 --> 01:05:13,998
But the more that feels earned, the more satisfying it is.

1209
01:05:14,459 --> 01:05:15,921
So in order for that to feel earned,

1210
01:05:16,201 --> 01:05:19,666
there has to be the potential of a negative outcome,

1211
01:05:19,706 --> 01:05:21,888
the potential of something bad happening.

1212
01:05:22,389 --> 01:05:25,132
And when that happens, I think one of the key points

1213
01:05:25,273 --> 01:05:26,554
is that the player understand.

1214
01:05:27,215 --> 01:05:29,135
why it happened and what the player can do

1215
01:05:29,255 --> 01:05:31,216
to prevent that from happening the next time.

1216
01:05:31,336 --> 01:05:34,117
I think that that's a win-win in many ways

1217
01:05:34,177 --> 01:05:36,477
because the player is now thinking about

1218
01:05:36,497 --> 01:05:38,398
another way of playing, about playing again,

1219
01:05:38,818 --> 01:05:40,979
which you've also added to the value

1220
01:05:40,999 --> 01:05:43,059
of the next piece of progress

1221
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:46,500
because it was won in spite of this adversity.

1222
01:05:46,600 --> 01:05:51,141
So managing the kind of reward and punishment process

1223
01:05:51,542 --> 01:05:53,802
is really fundamental to game design.

1224
01:05:56,891 --> 01:05:57,251
Over here.

1225
01:05:58,913 --> 01:05:59,273
Over here.

1226
01:05:59,293 --> 01:05:59,794
Hello?

1227
01:06:00,274 --> 01:06:00,435
Hi.

1228
01:06:01,175 --> 01:06:03,357
You talked earlier about trying to maintain

1229
01:06:03,378 --> 01:06:05,620
the player's idea of winning, always wanting to win,

1230
01:06:05,740 --> 01:06:09,123
and the whole problems arising with the load save issues.

1231
01:06:09,384 --> 01:06:10,625
A lot of times when I was playing Civ...

1232
01:06:11,777 --> 01:06:14,158
Even though I'd win the game, it much became a point

1233
01:06:14,198 --> 01:06:15,698
about trying to beat my own score.

1234
01:06:16,199 --> 01:06:18,400
And in order to do that, I had to take much more of an edge

1235
01:06:18,480 --> 01:06:20,541
by, you know, and it did come down to that whole

1236
01:06:20,581 --> 01:06:21,281
load save issues.

1237
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:23,422
I hated it when I lost a one, or there was something else

1238
01:06:23,462 --> 01:06:24,863
I needed to get me to the next point.

1239
01:06:25,343 --> 01:06:27,464
So my question to you is, how do you accommodate your design

1240
01:06:27,484 --> 01:06:29,345
when the player's not just trying to beat the machine,

1241
01:06:29,685 --> 01:06:30,445
but beat themselves?

1242
01:06:32,085 --> 01:06:35,588
I think that's another dimension of progress in one way,

1243
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:38,510
that you feel that progress against your own score.

1244
01:06:39,151 --> 01:06:42,914
Whether you use the load save mechanism to do that or not,

1245
01:06:43,314 --> 01:06:46,277
it's kind of your own moral choice, I think.

1246
01:06:46,797 --> 01:06:48,499
Games give you many, many ways to play,

1247
01:06:48,919 --> 01:06:49,840
and you get to pick the one

1248
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:51,581
that's hopefully most satisfying to you.

1249
01:06:53,042 --> 01:06:55,362
some of the talk about self-destructive behavior

1250
01:06:55,482 --> 01:06:57,403
was kind of oriented towards,

1251
01:06:57,883 --> 01:06:59,643
maybe there's some things we shouldn't make that easy

1252
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:01,083
because at the end of the day,

1253
01:07:01,603 --> 01:07:04,004
you might not feel as good about your victory

1254
01:07:04,044 --> 01:07:05,504
if you use some of these things.

1255
01:07:06,004 --> 01:07:07,945
And in Civ Revolution,

1256
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:10,925
we actually had these kind of Iron Man modes,

1257
01:07:10,985 --> 01:07:14,146
or we would actually keep track of the number of load saves

1258
01:07:14,166 --> 01:07:17,407
that you did, and that would be mentioned

1259
01:07:17,467 --> 01:07:18,867
along with your score, so you could kind of,

1260
01:07:20,548 --> 01:07:23,391
By doing it without loading and saving, for example,

1261
01:07:23,871 --> 01:07:26,274
that would actually be something that would be noted on there

1262
01:07:26,414 --> 01:07:29,818
and let you feel even better about your final score.

1263
01:07:29,838 --> 01:07:33,603
Hi, Sid, over here, all the way to your left.

1264
01:07:37,027 --> 01:07:39,309
In regards to the social network gaming,

1265
01:07:40,826 --> 01:07:44,267
There is a rampant kind of issue with cloning of games.

1266
01:07:44,327 --> 01:07:47,847
So there's like 12 farm games and 22 island games

1267
01:07:47,927 --> 01:07:51,148
and 73 sim games now.

1268
01:07:52,168 --> 01:07:57,009
How do you foresee the protection of your IP

1269
01:07:57,209 --> 01:08:01,090
or your kind of your big civilization network?

1270
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:03,151
Because it's an issue for everyone

1271
01:08:03,171 --> 01:08:04,571
who's developing on social networks.

1272
01:08:06,211 --> 01:08:07,591
That's definitely an issue.

1273
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:11,795
I think my role is to make the best game that I can make.

1274
01:08:13,298 --> 01:08:17,024
We're doing, we're playing the game almost daily right now

1275
01:08:17,084 --> 01:08:18,887
and we're putting in all sorts of cool stuff.

1276
01:08:19,592 --> 01:08:23,374
So I think the way that we try and deal with that

1277
01:08:23,434 --> 01:08:26,935
is to make the best game that we can

1278
01:08:26,955 --> 01:08:30,156
and in that way make it very difficult to duplicate

1279
01:08:30,176 --> 01:08:31,116
because someone would have to go through

1280
01:08:31,136 --> 01:08:33,197
that same testing experience

1281
01:08:33,337 --> 01:08:35,258
and trying all the same dead ends that we tried

1282
01:08:35,298 --> 01:08:39,219
that didn't work before getting to kind of what does work.

1283
01:08:40,560 --> 01:08:41,700
I think that question is,

1284
01:08:42,320 --> 01:08:44,241
my role as a designer is just to make

1285
01:08:44,281 --> 01:08:45,221
the best game I can make.

1286
01:08:46,042 --> 01:08:47,442
What the industry does is,

1287
01:08:48,064 --> 01:08:52,066
It's kind of out of my hands, but I love my job,

1288
01:08:52,086 --> 01:08:54,147
so I'm not complaining.

1289
01:08:56,148 --> 01:08:56,408
Right here.

1290
01:08:56,428 --> 01:08:59,130
Hi, thanks for the talk, loved it.

1291
01:09:00,931 --> 01:09:03,693
My question is about player expectations.

1292
01:09:03,713 --> 01:09:06,314
Do you always have to acquiesce to these?

1293
01:09:06,434 --> 01:09:09,056
Have you ever purposefully flown in the face

1294
01:09:09,196 --> 01:09:10,757
of what the player expects?

1295
01:09:11,037 --> 01:09:14,980
And you're about the example of the math

1296
01:09:15,260 --> 01:09:17,161
and the soldiers, three versus one.

1297
01:09:17,621 --> 01:09:32,399
Is there a deeper immersion achieved if a player's belief is rectified and he gains a feeling that he understands the mechanic rather than just having a vague notion of math that he was using before?

1298
01:09:33,868 --> 01:09:39,734
I think the fundamental purpose for dealing with the combat situation the way we did

1299
01:09:40,315 --> 01:09:46,481
was to not give the player a reason to jump out of the game to suspend their disbelief.

1300
01:09:46,501 --> 01:09:48,242
That was kind of our primary goal.

1301
01:09:51,105 --> 01:09:57,873
What I kind of realized though in going through that process was that in some ways the player is actually right about what they're feeling

1302
01:09:58,373 --> 01:09:58,673
that

1303
01:09:59,674 --> 01:10:05,821
In a computer game, you know, we say the odds are three to one, but the player isn't actually rolling the dice

1304
01:10:06,041 --> 01:10:11,828
You know, they don't actually see that process. That's all happening somehow in some mysterious background code that

1305
01:10:12,788 --> 01:10:15,629
some designer wrote that they may or may not trust.

1306
01:10:16,049 --> 01:10:18,290
And so they're kind of at the mercy of the designer.

1307
01:10:18,350 --> 01:10:20,770
So if bad things happen there

1308
01:10:20,810 --> 01:10:22,411
that they can't see the reason for,

1309
01:10:22,911 --> 01:10:25,071
this paranoia is really gonna kick in.

1310
01:10:25,612 --> 01:10:27,252
So that by making the odds,

1311
01:10:28,352 --> 01:10:29,732
the outcomes kind of conform

1312
01:10:29,752 --> 01:10:31,313
to what the player's expectations were,

1313
01:10:31,713 --> 01:10:33,473
we kind of damp down this paranoia

1314
01:10:33,553 --> 01:10:35,614
and also keep them in the game.

1315
01:10:37,175 --> 01:10:41,198
So that was kind of the thinking process

1316
01:10:41,218 --> 01:10:42,039
that we went through.

1317
01:10:42,059 --> 01:10:45,763
We don't always try and meet the player's expectations

1318
01:10:45,823 --> 01:10:47,785
exactly, I mean, there have to be surprises,

1319
01:10:48,165 --> 01:10:49,106
have to be new things.

1320
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:52,949
I put ballroom dancing into the new Pirates game.

1321
01:10:53,430 --> 01:10:55,311
That was a surprise to a lot of people.

1322
01:10:55,832 --> 01:10:57,814
Might have been one of the things on the my bad list.

1323
01:10:59,701 --> 01:11:01,102
So we do try and surprise players,

1324
01:11:01,602 --> 01:11:04,144
but not in kind of fundamental things

1325
01:11:04,665 --> 01:11:07,066
that determine their success or failure.

1326
01:11:11,464 --> 01:11:12,304
Hi, thank you, great talk.

1327
01:11:12,324 --> 01:11:14,065
Kind of a follow-up to that question.

1328
01:11:14,585 --> 01:11:17,667
In the way that your nine difficulty levels work,

1329
01:11:18,987 --> 01:11:22,108
does the math get more honest at the higher difficulty levels?

1330
01:11:22,368 --> 01:11:23,569
And second follow-up question,

1331
01:11:23,629 --> 01:11:25,290
your personal preferences in gaming,

1332
01:11:25,970 --> 01:11:28,591
do you enjoy games that are unabashedly difficult,

1333
01:11:28,671 --> 01:11:29,651
like Demon's Souls?

1334
01:11:32,072 --> 01:11:32,772
First question was,

1335
01:11:33,193 --> 01:11:34,993
how are the difficulty levels implemented?

1336
01:11:36,834 --> 01:11:38,255
There's no simple answer to that.

1337
01:11:38,984 --> 01:11:45,250
question. I think that again, AI difficulty to me is a full

1338
01:11:45,530 --> 01:11:48,753
range of tools that we use to create a customized experience

1339
01:11:49,333 --> 01:11:54,618
for the player. The first difficulty level is one that

1340
01:11:54,678 --> 01:11:58,922
basically takes you on a tour through the game. You're probably

1341
01:11:58,942 --> 01:12:01,404
going to win at the end, but you're going to get to see all

1342
01:12:01,424 --> 01:12:04,367
the cool stuff that happens, and you'll understand that the next

1343
01:12:04,427 --> 01:12:05,468
time it'll be more difficult.

1344
01:12:05,928 --> 01:12:08,750
And with Civ in particular, the highest difficulty level

1345
01:12:08,830 --> 01:12:13,714
is something that has to totally kick your butt every time

1346
01:12:13,734 --> 01:12:15,015
or else you don't feel satisfied.

1347
01:12:15,055 --> 01:12:19,038
It's a point of honor just to survive the highest level.

1348
01:12:19,078 --> 01:12:23,041
So we're customizing those difficulty experiences

1349
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:26,504
using all sorts of different tools.

1350
01:12:27,645 --> 01:12:29,686
Do I enjoy games that are very difficult?

1351
01:12:32,506 --> 01:12:33,767
Generally not.

1352
01:12:35,308 --> 01:12:38,430
The problem for me is I pick up a game

1353
01:12:38,470 --> 01:12:39,731
and if I'm not really having fun

1354
01:12:39,771 --> 01:12:41,852
in the first 15 or 20 minutes,

1355
01:12:43,273 --> 01:12:45,435
I'm gonna say I'm not gonna really invest

1356
01:12:45,455 --> 01:12:47,436
the 10 or 20 hours it's probably gonna take

1357
01:12:47,456 --> 01:12:48,997
to start to get some fun out of this game

1358
01:12:49,037 --> 01:12:50,258
or really explore it.

1359
01:12:50,358 --> 01:12:54,701
So I'm, I guess, a pretty typical consumer in that fashion.

1360
01:12:57,502 --> 01:12:57,823
Over here.

1361
01:12:58,953 --> 01:13:03,035
During your slide presentation on my bad and the design

1362
01:13:03,075 --> 01:13:06,898
mistakes, there was a brief mention of an espionage game

1363
01:13:06,958 --> 01:13:10,520
mechanic that you didn't feel was very interesting to talk

1364
01:13:10,560 --> 01:13:13,741
about. Can you briefly summarize what that was and what you

1365
01:13:13,781 --> 01:13:14,021
learned?

1366
01:13:15,102 --> 01:13:17,284
Yeah, we call that the covert action rule.

1367
01:13:17,344 --> 01:13:19,706
Covert action is a game I wrote many, many years ago.

1368
01:13:20,727 --> 01:13:23,729
And basically, it was an espionage game and there was this kind of

1369
01:13:24,189 --> 01:13:27,232
interestingly complex mystery that you were trying to unravel with

1370
01:13:28,073 --> 01:13:32,156
people in different cities doing different things to do dastardly things to the world.

1371
01:13:32,716 --> 01:13:34,497
And in the process of unraveling that mystery,

1372
01:13:34,517 --> 01:13:36,218
you would go into these action sequences

1373
01:13:36,258 --> 01:13:38,479
where you'd sneak through a building in open safes

1374
01:13:38,579 --> 01:13:40,300
and clues and guards would chase you

1375
01:13:40,360 --> 01:13:44,282
and you'd follow cars around and you'd break codes

1376
01:13:44,382 --> 01:13:47,004
and unravel these circuits,

1377
01:13:47,064 --> 01:13:49,665
all sorts of cool action sequences and puzzles.

1378
01:13:50,606 --> 01:13:52,209
And based on our pirates experience,

1379
01:13:52,229 --> 01:13:53,331
we thought that was very cool.

1380
01:13:53,351 --> 01:13:56,877
Because pirates, for us, was a really neat combination

1381
01:13:56,917 --> 01:13:58,900
of action and role-playing and strategy

1382
01:13:58,920 --> 01:14:00,363
and all this kind of stuff working together.

1383
01:14:01,364 --> 01:14:02,607
But what we found was that...

1384
01:14:04,376 --> 01:14:07,157
there are really two games fighting very hard

1385
01:14:07,457 --> 01:14:08,198
against each other.

1386
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:10,979
That you were in the mystery part of the game

1387
01:14:10,999 --> 01:14:12,340
and you're trying to put together the clues

1388
01:14:12,400 --> 01:14:13,540
and figure things out and you say,

1389
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:15,121
okay, I need to go to Cairo, you know,

1390
01:14:15,181 --> 01:14:17,382
and break into this building and that's the next,

1391
01:14:17,402 --> 01:14:18,343
you know, it's going to take me

1392
01:14:18,403 --> 01:14:19,884
to the next step of this mystery.

1393
01:14:20,284 --> 01:14:22,265
And you do that and you kind of have

1394
01:14:22,305 --> 01:14:23,906
this cool action sequence and you pop out

1395
01:14:23,946 --> 01:14:24,966
of the building at the end, you know,

1396
01:14:24,986 --> 01:14:27,107
maybe five or 10 minutes later, and it's like.

1397
01:14:28,016 --> 01:14:30,018
what was I, what was that mystery again,

1398
01:14:30,078 --> 01:14:31,139
why did I go into that building?

1399
01:14:32,200 --> 01:14:35,362
And the two games are not necessarily better than one

1400
01:14:35,562 --> 01:14:39,506
was the rule we call the covert action rule.

1401
01:14:39,726 --> 01:14:41,567
The center of gravity of your game

1402
01:14:41,627 --> 01:14:42,948
kind of has to be in one place.

1403
01:14:43,449 --> 01:14:46,111
Everything else kind of supports that, enhances that,

1404
01:14:46,531 --> 01:14:47,312
but you've got to figure out,

1405
01:14:47,352 --> 01:14:48,873
is the center of gravity in the action,

1406
01:14:48,933 --> 01:14:52,476
is it in the strategy, how does that all work?

1407
01:14:53,497 --> 01:14:55,038
And when we look back at Pirates,

1408
01:14:55,884 --> 01:14:58,204
we realize that the center of gravity of that game

1409
01:14:58,244 --> 01:14:59,444
is kind of in the strategy,

1410
01:14:59,604 --> 01:15:03,145
that the ship battles, the sword fights, et cetera,

1411
01:15:03,205 --> 01:15:05,906
are kind of quick and clear enough

1412
01:15:06,046 --> 01:15:08,827
that you don't lose the thread of what's going on

1413
01:15:09,687 --> 01:15:11,888
when you come back to the strategy game.

1414
01:15:12,868 --> 01:15:14,789
I think we have time for one more question.

1415
01:15:15,609 --> 01:15:16,009
Is there someone?

1416
01:15:16,549 --> 01:15:16,669
Yes.

1417
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:21,796
Thank you. When I was much younger, I had a lot of time to

1418
01:15:21,836 --> 01:15:25,136
devote to playing your games. I love the detail. And as I'm

1419
01:15:25,157 --> 01:15:28,057
getting older and I'm getting all these responsibilities, I'm

1420
01:15:28,077 --> 01:15:32,978
finding the detail overwhelming. So I'm wondering, is a situation

1421
01:15:32,998 --> 01:15:37,519
like mine, the aging gamer, is that playing a role in your game

1422
01:15:37,539 --> 01:15:39,840
development process? And if so, how are you dealing with it?

1423
01:15:42,626 --> 01:15:43,366
I have to say yes.

1424
01:15:43,486 --> 01:15:45,327
I mean, I'm an aging gamer myself,

1425
01:15:46,107 --> 01:15:49,789
and I think there, we have certainly evolved

1426
01:15:50,069 --> 01:15:51,829
from a kind of a hardcore-based,

1427
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:54,571
hardcore gamer-based industry

1428
01:15:54,631 --> 01:15:58,632
to now we're seeing all these diverse audiences for games.

1429
01:15:59,133 --> 01:16:01,834
And I think, in a way, Civilization Revolution

1430
01:16:01,894 --> 01:16:06,416
was kind of my response to complexity of games.

1431
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:09,077
I think there are players that don't have

1432
01:16:09,617 --> 01:16:10,137
10 or 20 hours or 40 hours.

1433
01:16:13,188 --> 01:16:14,649
10, 15, whatever amount of time it takes

1434
01:16:14,669 --> 01:16:17,911
to fully enjoy the fabulous Civilization PC experience.

1435
01:16:18,772 --> 01:16:19,772
But you don't always have that.

1436
01:16:20,513 --> 01:16:21,654
You might have a, you know,

1437
01:16:21,674 --> 01:16:23,915
and you might want to play a game with someone

1438
01:16:23,935 --> 01:16:26,037
who's not that deeply into Civilization.

1439
01:16:26,477 --> 01:16:29,619
So Civ Revolution was an experience

1440
01:16:29,639 --> 01:16:31,821
that was geared towards that audience.

1441
01:16:32,261 --> 01:16:33,141
And it was something that I found

1442
01:16:33,161 --> 01:16:34,162
very interesting to design.

1443
01:16:34,202 --> 01:16:36,544
It kind of tapped into, in many ways, kind of,

1444
01:16:37,404 --> 01:16:38,904
where I was in terms of gaming,

1445
01:16:38,944 --> 01:16:41,365
I wanted to sample a lot of different games.

1446
01:16:42,645 --> 01:16:46,026
And so I think we're seeing this incredible diversity

1447
01:16:46,046 --> 01:16:47,166
of games these days.

1448
01:16:47,206 --> 01:16:50,007
I mean, from games that take only a few minutes to play,

1449
01:16:50,147 --> 01:16:52,547
games that you play every little bit of time every day,

1450
01:16:52,968 --> 01:16:54,928
games that you sit down with and totally devour,

1451
01:16:55,448 --> 01:16:57,428
that take tens and tens of hours.

1452
01:16:57,469 --> 01:16:58,969
I mean, it's a great time to be a gamer.

1453
01:16:59,009 --> 01:16:59,729
It's a great time to be.

1454
01:17:00,309 --> 01:17:02,212
in this industry because we have all this variety,

1455
01:17:02,252 --> 01:17:04,715
all these possibilities, but there's definitely,

1456
01:17:04,775 --> 01:17:06,357
I know, an aging gamer demographic,

1457
01:17:06,377 --> 01:17:07,778
there's a casual gamer demographic,

1458
01:17:07,798 --> 01:17:10,582
there's hardcore gamers, there's all sorts of gamers.

1459
01:17:11,202 --> 01:17:12,904
And once a year we all get to get together

1460
01:17:13,045 --> 01:17:15,568
here in San Francisco and celebrate ourselves.

1461
01:17:16,208 --> 01:17:19,292
So thank you again for coming, and it's been a pleasure.
