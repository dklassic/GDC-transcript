00:00:05,938 --> 00:00:11,620
Hello. My name is Dana Ruggiero and I'm giving a talk on how game developers define success.

2
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:22,204
I'm supposed to ask you to move in in case people need more chairs. Okay. So just by a

3
00:00:22,244 --> 00:00:27,606
show of hands, how many people here are game developers? Woo! And how many people here are

4
00:00:27,826 --> 00:00:30,987
games researchers, like you teach at a university as well? Yeah?

5
00:00:32,889 --> 00:00:34,212
Okay, a few.

6
00:00:34,652 --> 00:00:36,115
Anybody else I might have missed out on,

7
00:00:36,235 --> 00:00:38,319
students or things like that, game designers?

8
00:00:40,143 --> 00:00:42,044
So I am, I'm a researcher.

9
00:00:42,264 --> 00:00:45,407
If you're not familiar with the English terminology,

10
00:00:45,467 --> 00:00:47,008
and yes, this is a bath accent,

11
00:00:48,429 --> 00:00:50,930
then I'm a reader, which basically means I do research.

12
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:54,093
And the research I conduct is on games and learning.

13
00:00:55,393 --> 00:00:57,475
One of my passions is ethnography,

14
00:00:57,535 --> 00:00:58,996
basically getting stories.

15
00:00:59,656 --> 00:01:00,977
And over the last four years,

16
00:01:01,097 --> 00:01:02,919
I've gotten the stories of game design

17
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,040
from 55 game designers around the world,

18
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:07,842
people whose names you'll probably recognize.

19
00:01:09,953 --> 00:01:10,892
So to start off with.

20
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:16,690
When I started this project, my main idea was,

21
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:19,591
what is a framework for game design?

22
00:01:20,272 --> 00:01:22,393
What kinds of stories can game designers,

23
00:01:22,433 --> 00:01:25,134
game developers tell about their process

24
00:01:25,194 --> 00:01:28,316
that can help me learn if there's a certain way to do this?

25
00:01:29,376 --> 00:01:31,057
Is there a right way, is there a wrong way?

26
00:01:31,737 --> 00:01:32,798
What makes success?

27
00:01:33,398 --> 00:01:35,539
Well, that bombed pretty quick.

28
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:37,620
55 game designers, 55 different frameworks,

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,181
55 different stories.

30
00:01:41,702 --> 00:01:45,565
really zero consistency when it came to the actual stories.

31
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:48,006
But we did have some consistencies

32
00:01:48,466 --> 00:01:50,468
when it came to definitions of success.

33
00:01:51,508 --> 00:01:53,890
So this talk is about the fact that game design itself

34
00:01:53,950 --> 00:01:56,511
still exists beyond this mystique of programming,

35
00:01:56,872 --> 00:01:58,313
art, and showmanship.

36
00:01:58,673 --> 00:02:00,774
Maybe not for you, because you are game designers,

37
00:02:00,814 --> 00:02:01,875
and you know it's a slog.

38
00:02:02,335 --> 00:02:05,917
But for people that aren't game designers, people like me,

39
00:02:06,277 --> 00:02:08,159
it's like you press a magic button,

40
00:02:08,359 --> 00:02:09,259
and all of a sudden, boom.

41
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,941
There's this amazing game.

42
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:12,662
And I know that's not how it actually works.

43
00:02:13,443 --> 00:02:14,724
So when we look at game designers

44
00:02:14,824 --> 00:02:16,586
who have published at least one game,

45
00:02:17,567 --> 00:02:20,049
we can see that behind this mystique is hard work,

46
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:22,772
late nights, and the lure of lasting success.

47
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:25,635
This talk will look at how 55 game designers

48
00:02:25,995 --> 00:02:28,878
from Indy to AAA think about success

49
00:02:29,098 --> 00:02:31,160
in relation to their own journeys as game designers.

50
00:02:33,085 --> 00:02:34,105
So this is the first question.

51
00:02:34,285 --> 00:02:36,026
How do game designers define success?

52
00:02:36,606 --> 00:02:38,987
And then how do I actually answer that question?

53
00:02:39,388 --> 00:02:41,308
Believe it or not, you can't just call somebody up

54
00:02:41,369 --> 00:02:43,429
and say, hey, how do you define success?

55
00:02:44,590 --> 00:02:46,331
It stifles the conversation right away.

56
00:02:46,931 --> 00:02:47,131
Now,

57
00:02:48,314 --> 00:02:50,475
As a researcher, as somebody that works in a university

58
00:02:50,515 --> 00:02:52,036
as a professor, I can tell you right now,

59
00:02:52,116 --> 00:02:55,417
success for a professor is publications and research grants.

60
00:02:55,997 --> 00:02:56,377
That's it.

61
00:02:56,397 --> 00:02:58,218
Okay?

62
00:02:58,238 --> 00:02:59,018
That's pretty much it.

63
00:03:00,059 --> 00:03:02,900
But it seems to be very, very different for game designers.

64
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,061
So asking questions is basically what I do for a living.

65
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:09,563
And as a researcher, I'm interested in the lived experiences

66
00:03:09,963 --> 00:03:11,103
of a specific phenomenon.

67
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:12,944
And right now I'm very interested in games.

68
00:03:13,204 --> 00:03:14,305
I have been for the past 10 years.

69
00:03:15,568 --> 00:03:18,190
So here's the answer, four years of interviews,

70
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,172
research and writing, four years, all right?

71
00:03:23,392 --> 00:03:25,193
I spent a lot of time talking to game designers,

72
00:03:25,273 --> 00:03:27,154
mainly over Skype, sometimes in person,

73
00:03:27,655 --> 00:03:30,356
and in the end I had over 100 hours of recorded interviews

74
00:03:30,516 --> 00:03:31,697
and transcription was horrible.

75
00:03:32,117 --> 00:03:34,298
This is actually gonna be a book from Focal Press

76
00:03:34,338 --> 00:03:35,919
called Why We Design Games.

77
00:03:36,479 --> 00:03:37,459
It's coming out in December.

78
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:39,460
So the next question I had was,

79
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:41,601
what is the best way to actually tell this story?

80
00:03:42,742 --> 00:03:42,862
Now.

81
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:50,018
points if you recognize this guy without looking at the name. Okay? So Studs Terkel is an

82
00:03:50,058 --> 00:03:56,303
amazing, amazing writer and I kind of want to be him when I grow up. Not like him but his

83
00:03:56,343 --> 00:04:03,008
writing style because he's goofy. He wrote Working. Has anybody here read Working?

84
00:04:03,679 --> 00:04:05,041
Yes, amazing book.

85
00:04:05,461 --> 00:04:07,003
So what he did is he went around the country

86
00:04:07,063 --> 00:04:09,305
for years and years and he got the working lives

87
00:04:09,766 --> 00:04:13,490
of everybody from CEOs to waitresses to truck drivers

88
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,892
to bank accountants, everybody.

89
00:04:15,412 --> 00:04:17,995
And he had them tell it in their own personal way.

90
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:22,500
And the book, you would think you were that truck driver

91
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,603
or you were that CEO or you were that ballet dancer

92
00:04:24,623 --> 00:04:25,063
if you read it.

93
00:04:26,413 --> 00:04:28,535
So I'm not Studs Terkel, you know,

94
00:04:29,115 --> 00:04:31,958
and my writing style is not half as eloquent or well done,

95
00:04:32,458 --> 00:04:33,659
but I'm trying, and this work,

96
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:36,342
this is my best effort so far.

97
00:04:36,362 --> 00:04:40,545
Okay, so these are the people I interviewed, okay?

98
00:04:41,126 --> 00:04:43,328
The interviews ran the gamut from people

99
00:04:43,348 --> 00:04:45,229
who had dropped out of college to make games,

100
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:49,693
people in PhD programs, veterans of the field, newbies.

101
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,126
indie game developers and AAA. All very, very busy people who are willing to talk to me. If

102
00:04:56,146 --> 00:05:01,171
you're in this room, thank you. Okay? Thank you very much for talking to me. And this is what

103
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:05,376
I found. So there were 19 people who identified as women.

104
00:05:06,548 --> 00:05:08,989
The average was about 13 years of experience.

105
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:12,311
And the reason it's an average is because I asked

106
00:05:12,372 --> 00:05:14,673
from the time they had begun developing games.

107
00:05:14,913 --> 00:05:16,834
So not the time they had published their first game,

108
00:05:16,854 --> 00:05:18,315
but the time they had begun developing games.

109
00:05:18,876 --> 00:05:20,176
And some people had been when they were 13 years old.

110
00:05:21,837 --> 00:05:22,998
It was a snowball sampling.

111
00:05:23,058 --> 00:05:24,938
So the last question I asked this interview was,

112
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:27,819
is there anybody else out there

113
00:05:27,859 --> 00:05:29,999
whose game design process I should talk to?

114
00:05:30,719 --> 00:05:31,559
Who do you recommend?

115
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,180
So I got more people by asking them

116
00:05:34,220 --> 00:05:36,360
who they thought had a cool game design process.

117
00:05:37,141 --> 00:05:38,741
They had to have at least one published game.

118
00:05:38,781 --> 00:05:40,361
I had to be able to find it on the internet.

119
00:05:40,481 --> 00:05:41,642
My publisher insists.

120
00:05:42,602 --> 00:05:43,862
They had to be willing to talk to me.

121
00:05:44,282 --> 00:05:45,442
That was actually quite a big one.

122
00:05:45,482 --> 00:05:46,923
Not a lot of people were willing to talk to me.

123
00:05:48,223 --> 00:05:49,203
There were five questions.

124
00:05:50,277 --> 00:05:55,281
First question was, take me through the best game you ever played, the best game design

125
00:05:55,501 --> 00:05:56,302
that you thought you ever played.

126
00:05:56,662 --> 00:06:00,565
Second question is, when did you move from playing games to designing games?

127
00:06:01,525 --> 00:06:06,249
Third question was, tell me about your game design process from start to finish.

128
00:06:06,449 --> 00:06:07,870
So choose a game and bring me through it.

129
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:12,654
Fourth question was, how do you define success as a game designer, game developer?

130
00:06:13,094 --> 00:06:15,976
And fifth question was, who else do you recommend I speak to?

131
00:06:16,897 --> 00:06:18,937
The interviews lasted an average of 45 minutes.

132
00:06:19,418 --> 00:06:21,619
Some people spoke really fast, 10 minutes.

133
00:06:22,059 --> 00:06:23,840
Some people, Brenda Romero,

134
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:25,800
I was on the phone with for two hours.

135
00:06:26,401 --> 00:06:30,322
So it just depends on the kind of story

136
00:06:30,342 --> 00:06:30,943
you were gonna tell.

137
00:06:32,003 --> 00:06:32,823
So there were themes.

138
00:06:33,084 --> 00:06:34,304
There's about five themes.

139
00:06:34,324 --> 00:06:35,164
I'm gonna go through them now.

140
00:06:35,184 --> 00:06:38,946
Okay, the first theme was this idea of a one woman band,

141
00:06:39,206 --> 00:06:40,987
working alone and creating communities.

142
00:06:43,188 --> 00:06:45,189
So here are some examples of that, okay?

143
00:06:46,060 --> 00:06:48,361
Progress, in my one woman band,

144
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:50,842
progress is one way of making the band.

145
00:06:51,223 --> 00:06:53,384
This idea that you put little pieces together

146
00:06:53,604 --> 00:06:55,945
every single day, and this is a definition of success.

147
00:06:56,445 --> 00:06:59,347
Every single day, you move your project forward.

148
00:07:00,027 --> 00:07:02,208
And that you looked at your progress

149
00:07:02,248 --> 00:07:04,870
and said that same day, okay, this is good,

150
00:07:05,270 --> 00:07:06,631
now I can move on to the next step.

151
00:07:11,173 --> 00:07:12,534
Another one was creative freedom.

152
00:07:14,063 --> 00:07:16,383
I don't know if Achiru Lam is here at GDC,

153
00:07:16,563 --> 00:07:18,764
but thank you for drunken robot pornography.

154
00:07:19,144 --> 00:07:21,305
Amazing game, okay?

155
00:07:21,465 --> 00:07:22,645
And this idea of creative freedom,

156
00:07:23,005 --> 00:07:24,706
that basically you have the ability

157
00:07:26,026 --> 00:07:27,646
to play a 20 minute riff in your band,

158
00:07:28,006 --> 00:07:29,347
and you can call a rude name,

159
00:07:29,447 --> 00:07:30,687
and nobody's gonna come back at you

160
00:07:30,727 --> 00:07:33,188
because you are the band, you are this one woman show.

161
00:07:33,948 --> 00:07:35,488
And that's another way to think of success.

162
00:07:38,289 --> 00:07:39,870
Thirdly in the one woman band was this idea

163
00:07:39,910 --> 00:07:40,911
of building a following.

164
00:07:41,431 --> 00:07:43,272
Henry Smith's space team basically said that

165
00:07:43,572 --> 00:07:45,173
it's not about making money so much

166
00:07:45,333 --> 00:07:46,834
as it is about saying in the future,

167
00:07:47,215 --> 00:07:48,896
hey, I made that cool game,

168
00:07:48,956 --> 00:07:51,037
this is why you should buy this next cool game that I made.

169
00:07:51,858 --> 00:07:54,199
So building a following, the ability to create for yourself

170
00:07:54,259 --> 00:07:55,860
but also able to say, I made this.

171
00:07:56,721 --> 00:07:58,602
So back me because I made this other cool thing.

172
00:08:02,261 --> 00:08:07,863
Finally, agency. This idea that you want to promote agency and the joy of seeking your own

173
00:08:07,903 --> 00:08:13,324
process. You don't really care about other people defining your success. You know you're a

174
00:08:13,344 --> 00:08:17,385
game designer, you know you're a game developer, and that's it. That's good enough. This idea

175
00:08:17,405 --> 00:08:21,466
that you can just say screw this and I'm going to make my own types of games. Elizabeth

176
00:08:21,486 --> 00:08:26,428
Lopencia was actually very, very eloquent when she said that when you're starting from a

177
00:08:26,488 --> 00:08:30,409
place of seeking validation from other people, then that's not a creative process.

178
00:08:33,369 --> 00:08:35,871
The second theme that came up a lot was moving goalposts.

179
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,934
This idea of struggling with defining success

180
00:08:39,475 --> 00:08:41,276
and actually recognizing it when you see it.

181
00:08:41,917 --> 00:08:43,558
I actually suffer from this myself.

182
00:08:43,698 --> 00:08:46,001
I think there's even a name for it called imposter syndrome.

183
00:08:48,523 --> 00:08:50,485
So one of the first sub-themes in this was this idea

184
00:08:50,525 --> 00:08:52,266
that success is a sliding scale.

185
00:08:53,227 --> 00:08:55,229
Success can go back and forth.

186
00:08:55,910 --> 00:08:58,872
That you really have to think about

187
00:09:00,569 --> 00:09:05,894
confining success. Calling yourself successful across the board was almost like tempting

188
00:09:05,974 --> 00:09:12,241
fate too much. This project, this game, this little part is successful. And that can get

189
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:18,767
bigger or smaller depending on the games you're making. Approval.

190
00:09:19,972 --> 00:09:23,133
Okay, approval, Nina Freeman said this very, very well

191
00:09:23,153 --> 00:09:25,514
as well, that I still haven't gotten my own mom

192
00:09:25,554 --> 00:09:26,575
to play one of my games.

193
00:09:27,115 --> 00:09:29,436
When I do, I feel like that will be the end all of success.

194
00:09:30,777 --> 00:09:32,557
That by having the people that you love

195
00:09:32,597 --> 00:09:34,538
and the people that have raised you

196
00:09:34,998 --> 00:09:38,780
to actually validate what you're doing is a form of success.

197
00:09:42,255 --> 00:09:43,855
Andrea Phillips who made Perplex City,

198
00:09:44,215 --> 00:09:46,076
talks a lot about this idea of scalability.

199
00:09:46,396 --> 00:09:48,657
That small scale can still be successful.

200
00:09:48,717 --> 00:09:50,958
In fact, it's just as valid as large scale.

201
00:09:51,398 --> 00:09:53,439
They need to find your bubble and go with it.

202
00:09:53,919 --> 00:09:56,360
Because it has to be about you and not about a number.

203
00:09:56,500 --> 00:09:57,800
Do 50 people play your game?

204
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,961
Do 50,000 people play your game?

205
00:10:00,441 --> 00:10:02,402
Are you employed for six months at EA?

206
00:10:02,502 --> 00:10:04,462
Are you employed for 20 years somewhere else?

207
00:10:04,903 --> 00:10:06,243
What is your bubble?

208
00:10:06,543 --> 00:10:08,844
Look for it, find it, be okay with it.

209
00:10:13,134 --> 00:10:14,917
This idea that you have to just be okay.

210
00:10:14,937 --> 00:10:17,522
You have to be okay with not being successful.

211
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,847
Avery Alder McDonald doesn't actually make games anymore.

212
00:10:22,149 --> 00:10:24,914
She tells me that she stopped making games because of.

213
00:10:25,864 --> 00:10:28,965
well, lots of reasons, but this battle with success

214
00:10:29,005 --> 00:10:29,465
was one of them.

215
00:10:30,766 --> 00:10:32,287
She was probably one of the most elegant people

216
00:10:32,307 --> 00:10:33,207
that I actually interviewed.

217
00:10:33,967 --> 00:10:35,488
This idea that she doesn't have a good rubric

218
00:10:35,508 --> 00:10:36,708
for evaluating success.

219
00:10:37,629 --> 00:10:39,469
And that was seen in a lot of the interviews,

220
00:10:39,929 --> 00:10:41,370
hemming and hawing, me saying,

221
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:43,771
what makes you successful as a game designer,

222
00:10:43,831 --> 00:10:45,692
and people not being able to answer the question,

223
00:10:46,232 --> 00:10:48,073
or being able to answer it but taking 20 minutes.

224
00:10:49,719 --> 00:10:52,142
Being okay with not being successful is really hard to do.

225
00:10:52,963 --> 00:10:55,506
Some designers talked about the idea

226
00:10:55,526 --> 00:10:56,948
that success can go both ways,

227
00:10:57,589 --> 00:10:59,251
and that being okay with that is a challenge

228
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,653
and a good way to think of goalposts.

229
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:03,016
So the fact that you're not successful

230
00:11:03,476 --> 00:11:05,559
and being okay with that is a way of being successful.

231
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:07,561
It's very meta, but it's a big circle.

232
00:11:10,785 --> 00:11:13,108
One of the third theme was horizon scanning.

233
00:11:13,689 --> 00:11:15,410
This idea that as a game designer,

234
00:11:15,430 --> 00:11:17,553
you always want to provide new interactions,

235
00:11:18,133 --> 00:11:21,077
new technologies, new ways of working.

236
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:25,742
So one of those things was accountability.

237
00:11:26,442 --> 00:11:28,084
That as the game designer,

238
00:11:28,124 --> 00:11:29,746
you have to be accountable to your players.

239
00:11:30,597 --> 00:11:35,042
that players liking your game was a sign of success

240
00:11:35,502 --> 00:11:37,384
and that you want to bring new things

241
00:11:37,464 --> 00:11:39,426
and be interesting and have interesting things

242
00:11:39,967 --> 00:11:42,190
for your players, but that you should be aware

243
00:11:42,230 --> 00:11:43,611
that they're gonna hold you accountable.

244
00:11:44,112 --> 00:11:46,554
Kyle Gabler, who's part of 2D Boy,

245
00:11:46,995 --> 00:11:48,156
said this very, very well,

246
00:11:48,637 --> 00:11:51,720
that otherwise we're just wasting everybody else's time.

247
00:11:55,490 --> 00:11:58,351
transforming play, beyond the actual game,

248
00:11:58,672 --> 00:12:01,052
not just saying within the game, but beyond the actual game,

249
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:02,813
it was also mentioned quite a lot.

250
00:12:03,133 --> 00:12:05,214
Bringing in the unexpected, bringing the joy,

251
00:12:05,274 --> 00:12:06,835
creating new play experience,

252
00:12:07,235 --> 00:12:08,615
and then challenging yourself to say,

253
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:11,336
okay, we've done that, now let's go beyond that.

254
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:14,017
If, like Robin here says, after they're done,

255
00:12:14,037 --> 00:12:16,538
they can say, wow, that was unexpected.

256
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:18,079
I didn't think I would enjoy that,

257
00:12:18,199 --> 00:12:20,280
but now I see the world differently as a result of it,

258
00:12:20,700 --> 00:12:22,280
then you are a successful game designer.

259
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:23,861
It's the ultimate success.

260
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,104
Enhancing Design Vocabulary.

261
00:12:31,515 --> 00:12:32,836
It's one thing to make a game.

262
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:34,596
It's something else to make something

263
00:12:34,836 --> 00:12:36,977
that somebody else can then take and make another game

264
00:12:37,117 --> 00:12:39,818
or to make something else, pushing it forward, okay?

265
00:12:40,659 --> 00:12:42,099
It's one thing to be an expert,

266
00:12:42,119 --> 00:12:44,340
but then it's another thing to be able to take that expertise

267
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:46,521
and teach somebody else how to do it.

268
00:12:47,301 --> 00:12:49,161
John Romero actually says this very, very well,

269
00:12:49,201 --> 00:12:50,982
that game design has been around a long time

270
00:12:51,062 --> 00:12:52,563
and that Angry Birds could have been made

271
00:12:53,283 --> 00:12:54,703
with the 8-bit computers of the 80s,

272
00:12:54,763 --> 00:12:56,504
but it wasn't because our design vocabulary

273
00:12:56,564 --> 00:12:57,985
wasn't established.

274
00:12:59,157 --> 00:13:01,219
So this idea of weaving threads of success,

275
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,142
that you being successful on your own as a game designer

276
00:13:04,202 --> 00:13:06,965
is one pinpoint, but then being able to push that forward,

277
00:13:07,005 --> 00:13:08,827
being able to say, okay, other people can now use

278
00:13:08,867 --> 00:13:10,829
this technology, can now use this interaction,

279
00:13:11,289 --> 00:13:14,153
can now use this design vocabulary, and make it more,

280
00:13:14,373 --> 00:13:16,335
make it better, not proprietary.

281
00:13:20,579 --> 00:13:21,200
Satisfaction.

282
00:13:22,322 --> 00:13:28,505
Ed Key who wrote Proteus and who likes to take long hikes talked to me a lot about

283
00:13:28,885 --> 00:13:33,947
motivation, this idea that he wants to create neat things but that there still has to be

284
00:13:34,067 --> 00:13:39,009
player satisfaction within that. That you can push past boundaries. You can make

285
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:45,693
something that you control with a churro and then you eat the churro but nobody else can

286
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:49,815
actually make that and maybe it's not satisfying as a game design experience. He was a lot

287
00:13:49,835 --> 00:13:50,775
more elegant than I am in this.

288
00:13:51,812 --> 00:13:53,293
but that you have to retain good play.

289
00:13:54,234 --> 00:13:57,016
That good play is one of the key marks

290
00:13:57,516 --> 00:13:58,557
of being a good game designer

291
00:13:59,118 --> 00:14:00,519
and has to be engaging for people.

292
00:14:02,921 --> 00:14:05,042
This is the one I actually expected to come up first

293
00:14:05,123 --> 00:14:06,764
and didn't, okay?

294
00:14:07,084 --> 00:14:08,445
That we do this for money.

295
00:14:08,906 --> 00:14:10,887
Out of the 55 game designers I spoke to,

296
00:14:11,288 --> 00:14:14,290
nobody came out and said, I do this for money.

297
00:14:15,485 --> 00:14:17,307
I was surprised, but then I thought,

298
00:14:17,767 --> 00:14:19,289
I am recording you for a book,

299
00:14:19,809 --> 00:14:22,051
so maybe you don't wanna say,

300
00:14:22,451 --> 00:14:26,174
you know, I go to work for a paycheck, okay?

301
00:14:26,414 --> 00:14:29,036
But this theme was probably one of the most powerful,

302
00:14:29,597 --> 00:14:32,319
and one sub-question I asked a lot of indie game designers

303
00:14:32,379 --> 00:14:34,381
was, if you worked for a triple A,

304
00:14:34,461 --> 00:14:36,322
would your game design process change?

305
00:14:37,568 --> 00:14:40,091
And a lot of them said no, that they would rather stack boxes

306
00:14:40,131 --> 00:14:43,394
than change their game design process for money.

307
00:14:44,195 --> 00:14:46,777
So this idea is we got to eat, paying the bills

308
00:14:46,817 --> 00:14:47,738
and responsibilities.

309
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:51,602
So one aspect of success was funding.

310
00:14:51,802 --> 00:14:53,324
Warren Spector basically said that,

311
00:14:54,344 --> 00:14:55,966
I measure success by this idea that

312
00:14:57,096 --> 00:14:58,357
Can my next game get funded?

313
00:14:58,537 --> 00:14:59,977
How many do I have to sell of this game

314
00:15:00,198 --> 00:15:01,598
to get the next game funded?

315
00:15:02,339 --> 00:15:04,420
Moving forward through funding was a practical

316
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:06,581
yet tried way of thinking about financial success.

317
00:15:07,541 --> 00:15:09,402
Based solely on numbers, what does it take

318
00:15:09,442 --> 00:15:10,503
to be able to make another game?

319
00:15:10,923 --> 00:15:11,924
What is the magic number?

320
00:15:13,244 --> 00:15:14,865
I guess it depends on who you are

321
00:15:15,445 --> 00:15:16,486
as well as the game you make.

322
00:15:18,966 --> 00:15:20,808
Another one was about fearing the mundane.

323
00:15:20,968 --> 00:15:22,909
Davy Reden said it best in the Stanley Parable

324
00:15:22,929 --> 00:15:25,752
that he actually fears normal jobs,

325
00:15:26,532 --> 00:15:30,256
that he has to be profitable because if he's not profitable,

326
00:15:30,576 --> 00:15:32,798
then he has to go back to doing a normal job.

327
00:15:33,659 --> 00:15:37,122
Making money was a way to avoid the soul-destroying job,

328
00:15:37,742 --> 00:15:40,124
and money makes it possible to continue to be creative

329
00:15:40,605 --> 00:15:42,746
and design games rather than stacking boxes.

330
00:15:46,294 --> 00:15:48,175
Then we had some people that said, that's okay,

331
00:15:48,715 --> 00:15:53,617
I'd rather stack boxes than do this creativity burn

332
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:56,778
that making money ensues,

333
00:15:57,118 --> 00:16:00,919
that let's be okay with the idea of stacking boxes

334
00:16:01,159 --> 00:16:02,240
as the pressure to make money

335
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,261
burns creative energy day after day,

336
00:16:05,101 --> 00:16:07,122
and that really being able to take your extra time

337
00:16:07,742 --> 00:16:09,202
and make something you're passionate about

338
00:16:09,943 --> 00:16:11,883
would be worth it if you just had a normal job.

339
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,517
and this idea of responsibility.

340
00:16:18,975 --> 00:16:22,016
We're not all one-man bands or one-woman bands, all right?

341
00:16:22,677 --> 00:16:25,318
Some people, a lot of people, have responsibilities.

342
00:16:25,758 --> 00:16:27,378
They have kids, they have grandparents,

343
00:16:27,438 --> 00:16:28,919
they have houses, they have mortgages.

344
00:16:29,379 --> 00:16:31,140
They have a lifestyle they want to maintain.

345
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:34,021
You have responsibilities, and one of those,

346
00:16:34,041 --> 00:16:36,001
one of the responsibilities is you have to eat.

347
00:16:36,802 --> 00:16:38,342
And the responsibility, first,

348
00:16:38,582 --> 00:16:40,003
was a theme that really came across.

349
00:16:40,423 --> 00:16:42,564
I will say that theme came across more in the people

350
00:16:42,584 --> 00:16:43,744
that have been doing this longer

351
00:16:44,505 --> 00:16:46,705
than it did for the people that have been doing it

352
00:16:46,745 --> 00:16:47,606
a shorter amount of time.

353
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:52,647
but this really brings to light this idea that every effort brings both artistic and

354
00:16:52,687 --> 00:16:57,309
commercial success ideally, but sometimes you only get one, and one of them will pay

355
00:16:57,369 --> 00:17:06,472
bills and one of them won't. We also have this idea of creating a lasting legacy, of

356
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:10,873
hitting it big, being remembered in games, being the person that made this thing that

357
00:17:11,073 --> 00:17:16,315
everybody can then say, I made this thing. Go get your picture with them at GDC. It's

358
00:17:16,355 --> 00:17:17,356
that person that made the thing.

359
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:23,978
So this idea of looking beyond, constantly looking beyond,

360
00:17:24,258 --> 00:17:25,739
is exhausting, okay?

361
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:28,159
It's exhausting, yet this is where many game designers

362
00:17:28,179 --> 00:17:31,160
seem to find themselves, this drive to make something

363
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,481
that would be remembered forever.

364
00:17:32,921 --> 00:17:34,682
And Jason Rohr actually said it very, very well,

365
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,222
that it's like the old obscenity thing.

366
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:37,522
You know it when you see it.

367
00:17:38,043 --> 00:17:39,823
You know something fantastic when you see it.

368
00:17:41,023 --> 00:17:42,444
And that something that will last,

369
00:17:42,484 --> 00:17:44,965
something that's just more, that's just not binary,

370
00:17:44,985 --> 00:17:45,925
something beyond that.

371
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,146
And I couldn't get him to be any more specific

372
00:17:48,166 --> 00:17:48,866
than that, honestly.

373
00:17:51,404 --> 00:17:58,706
Ego. Okay? Very much an ego‑driven occupation from the 55 people I talked to. Maybe not all

374
00:17:58,746 --> 00:18:03,167
of you, but from the 55 people I talked to. It was very evident throughout the interviews,

375
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:08,809
the idea of go big or go home. Make something. Make something that will stand the test of

376
00:18:08,849 --> 00:18:14,010
history. And Anna Tito, a developer from Australia, says it very, very well, that the games are

377
00:18:14,050 --> 00:18:17,831
an experience and that she releases the whole experience and not just one song.

378
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,522
that games have to be good over the years.

379
00:18:24,603 --> 00:18:27,325
Decades if you're lucky, but definitely good over the years.

380
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,447
Years are the enemy of digital games.

381
00:18:29,647 --> 00:18:31,329
Mechanics and technology improve,

382
00:18:31,749 --> 00:18:33,471
and what was amazing 10 years ago

383
00:18:33,531 --> 00:18:35,012
may look antiquated a few years later.

384
00:18:36,089 --> 00:18:38,911
joy, fun, and having a good time do not fade.

385
00:18:39,671 --> 00:18:41,833
And game designers see this as a lasting legacy,

386
00:18:42,253 --> 00:18:43,574
a way of thinking about success.

387
00:18:44,174 --> 00:18:45,955
David Jaffe actually said it very, very well

388
00:18:46,015 --> 00:18:49,377
that game design success is that going back

389
00:18:49,417 --> 00:18:51,018
and being able to play these games years later

390
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:52,859
and still having a good time.

391
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:58,249
this idea that you should leave something behind.

392
00:18:58,729 --> 00:19:00,189
That when somebody plays your game,

393
00:19:00,830 --> 00:19:02,230
the part of the game should go with them.

394
00:19:02,791 --> 00:19:04,931
Game designers want to create a lasting experience

395
00:19:04,971 --> 00:19:05,492
for the player.

396
00:19:06,032 --> 00:19:08,873
Little pieces of the game that are left behind

397
00:19:09,733 --> 00:19:11,034
and bring it forward.

398
00:19:11,054 --> 00:19:13,075
Okay, they actually bring them forward.

399
00:19:13,135 --> 00:19:17,417
Larylyn McWilliams said to me that she thinks

400
00:19:17,457 --> 00:19:19,297
that games that are ranked the highest

401
00:19:19,337 --> 00:19:21,678
and should rank the highest are the ones

402
00:19:21,698 --> 00:19:23,959
that leave something behind when you're done with playing them.

403
00:19:27,622 --> 00:19:28,663
So here's some lessons learned

404
00:19:28,683 --> 00:19:29,964
from those five different themes.

405
00:19:32,326 --> 00:19:35,809
One, nobody was one thing.

406
00:19:36,349 --> 00:19:39,371
There was an amazing amount of overlap.

407
00:19:39,832 --> 00:19:41,893
I thought I was going to have people fall

408
00:19:41,933 --> 00:19:43,194
into one theme or the other,

409
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,476
but what it came down to is that many people

410
00:19:45,516 --> 00:19:46,757
fell across the different themes,

411
00:19:47,678 --> 00:19:49,820
simply because, yes, they might do it for money,

412
00:19:49,860 --> 00:19:52,281
but they were also simply very passionate about their jobs.

413
00:19:52,762 --> 00:19:54,703
Yes, they might wanna leave a lasting legacy,

414
00:19:54,743 --> 00:19:56,925
but also was about having creative freedom.

415
00:20:00,303 --> 00:20:01,804
This is probably the most frustrating.

416
00:20:02,345 --> 00:20:04,647
Experience does not equal clarity.

417
00:20:05,688 --> 00:20:08,271
The ability to talk about the game design process

418
00:20:08,691 --> 00:20:10,493
did not get clearer when interviewing people

419
00:20:10,533 --> 00:20:11,594
with the most experience.

420
00:20:12,394 --> 00:20:15,818
In fact, some people were so beyond knowledgeable

421
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:17,479
that they couldn't define success anymore.

422
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,162
The process of game design was so ingrained within them.

423
00:20:20,903 --> 00:20:22,144
Clarity about individual projects

424
00:20:22,164 --> 00:20:23,405
was actually more easy to recall.

425
00:20:25,025 --> 00:20:25,885
And have you seen this?

426
00:20:25,986 --> 00:20:27,547
It's something we tend to use

427
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:29,228
when we're talking about expert analysis.

428
00:20:29,769 --> 00:20:31,870
And these people were basically in the fourth level.

429
00:20:32,271 --> 00:20:33,271
They were so competent,

430
00:20:33,311 --> 00:20:34,312
they couldn't actually tell me

431
00:20:34,652 --> 00:20:36,314
how they were competent anymore.

432
00:20:36,794 --> 00:20:38,155
The people that were newer at this,

433
00:20:38,215 --> 00:20:39,696
the people that had maybe been designing 10,

434
00:20:42,289 --> 00:20:44,230
10 years or so, they had conscious competence.

435
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:45,451
They could bring me through their steps.

436
00:20:45,491 --> 00:20:46,993
They could define very, very easily

437
00:20:47,373 --> 00:20:48,534
what it meant to be successful.

438
00:20:49,054 --> 00:20:50,035
But the people that had been doing this

439
00:20:50,075 --> 00:20:52,557
a very, very long time, the lines had blurred.

440
00:20:53,338 --> 00:20:56,921
They simply couldn't lay it out in a straight line.

441
00:20:59,962 --> 00:21:01,865
Goal setting is continuous and ongoing.

442
00:21:02,585 --> 00:21:04,267
Throughout the interview, many game designers

443
00:21:04,368 --> 00:21:06,010
talked about evolving processes

444
00:21:06,410 --> 00:21:08,092
and evolving definitions of success.

445
00:21:08,573 --> 00:21:11,336
It's a success to just simply keep designing games,

446
00:21:11,776 --> 00:21:13,719
and it's a success to be able to keep trying.

447
00:21:17,557 --> 00:21:20,200
Finally, you don't have it figured out any more than I do.

448
00:21:21,461 --> 00:21:21,822
You don't.

449
00:21:22,843 --> 00:21:26,007
No game has the same journey and no game designer

450
00:21:26,067 --> 00:21:28,190
has the same process for thinking about success.

451
00:21:28,710 --> 00:21:31,153
From the analogies they develop to the games they produce,

452
00:21:31,333 --> 00:21:34,117
game designers in this presentation have worked alone,

453
00:21:34,477 --> 00:21:36,980
dealt with moving goal posts, scanned the horizon.

454
00:21:37,681 --> 00:21:42,283
of what could be next, paid the bills, and aimed for creating lasting legacies. The kinds

455
00:21:42,323 --> 00:21:46,585
of analogies they talked about were the first penguin, Sherry Rayner Gray being the first

456
00:21:46,645 --> 00:21:54,048
penguin, fields of virgin snow, the magic circle, walking alone, making the music, puzzles.

457
00:21:54,569 --> 00:21:56,589
Everybody had an analogy for what they were doing.

458
00:21:57,717 --> 00:22:01,638
This is in no way a comprehensive list of every success status that could exist, but

459
00:22:01,678 --> 00:22:05,739
by examining the design process of these designers, we have learned that this field is about the

460
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:10,661
audaciousness of creation, the privilege of impact, and the sheer exhaustion and exhilaration

461
00:22:10,681 --> 00:22:12,561
that comes when they have put the game to bed.

462
00:22:14,022 --> 00:22:14,322
Thank you.

463
00:22:14,802 --> 00:22:15,182
Questions?

464
00:22:29,427 --> 00:22:30,928
And if I interviewed you when you're here, hi.

465
00:22:31,208 --> 00:22:31,548
Okay.

466
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:36,931
I have a question regarding,

467
00:22:36,951 --> 00:22:40,173
so you asked each of the individual game developers,

468
00:22:40,753 --> 00:22:43,695
but game development is very collaborative.

469
00:22:44,375 --> 00:22:47,097
I'm wondering if you detected a strain

470
00:22:47,557 --> 00:22:49,958
that tended toward collaboration

471
00:22:50,519 --> 00:22:54,861
or away from collaboration as far as measures of success.

472
00:22:55,742 --> 00:22:56,604
Okay, good question.

473
00:22:56,745 --> 00:22:58,690
So were there strains of collaboration

474
00:22:58,710 --> 00:23:00,997
or were there not strains of collaboration in?

475
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:04,191
in defining success.

476
00:23:04,231 --> 00:23:05,752
Is there a hostility to it?

477
00:23:05,772 --> 00:23:08,794
Because I noticed you said people said they'd rather not

478
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:09,894
change their process.

479
00:23:09,914 --> 00:23:11,615
They'd rather be packing boxes.

480
00:23:12,056 --> 00:23:13,857
Well, when you work with other people,

481
00:23:13,877 --> 00:23:17,139
it's really important to be flexible.

482
00:23:17,659 --> 00:23:18,219
That is true.

483
00:23:18,540 --> 00:23:21,702
So of the 55 people that I interviewed, well, 56 people,

484
00:23:22,102 --> 00:23:26,064
one was a pair, Danielle Swank and Jim Fleming.

485
00:23:26,925 --> 00:23:29,566
They're a pair, and they work actually very, very well

486
00:23:29,606 --> 00:23:31,568
together in terms of their design process.

487
00:23:33,123 --> 00:23:36,964
Everybody else that I interviewed talked about themselves as a sole game designer.

488
00:23:37,304 --> 00:23:42,106
They didn't really get into the idea of collaboration and when they did, so for instance, John Romero

489
00:23:42,146 --> 00:23:49,089
talked about an online game that he had created and the idea there was that I needed them

490
00:23:49,129 --> 00:23:52,510
to talk about something where they had the decision making process.

491
00:23:53,330 --> 00:23:57,052
So when they talked about collaboration, it was secondary to their definitions of success.

492
00:24:01,753 --> 00:24:03,214
Thanks for the great talk.

493
00:24:04,774 --> 00:24:09,155
After you talking with these designer and famous game

494
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:15,717
developers, what's your general feel about these people

495
00:24:15,837 --> 00:24:16,337
as a group?

496
00:24:16,457 --> 00:24:20,258
Do you think that generally they are good people, bad people?

497
00:24:20,518 --> 00:24:25,219
Or do they are just nasty people that are just egotistic

498
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:25,900
or whatever?

499
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:28,800
So if you just take them as a group,

500
00:24:29,080 --> 00:24:30,801
what would you characterize them?

501
00:24:31,291 --> 00:24:32,916
Okay, so I'm being recorded as well.

502
00:24:32,936 --> 00:24:35,222
Uh...

503
00:24:36,285 --> 00:24:39,073
No one seems like a bad person, you know?

504
00:24:41,531 --> 00:24:44,133
Everybody was very, people that agreed to speak to me

505
00:24:44,733 --> 00:24:48,096
were people that were willing to have their ideas out there.

506
00:24:48,496 --> 00:24:50,477
And they also were willing for me to give this presentation

507
00:24:50,497 --> 00:24:51,738
because I sent them an email

508
00:24:52,018 --> 00:24:53,339
saying I was giving this presentation.

509
00:24:55,221 --> 00:24:56,321
I would guess they're good people.

510
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:58,003
I mean, I don't really know anything

511
00:24:58,063 --> 00:24:59,263
about their personal lives.

512
00:24:59,744 --> 00:25:02,225
What I did want to hear about was,

513
00:25:02,266 --> 00:25:03,026
I wanted to hear about people

514
00:25:03,066 --> 00:25:05,148
that had different game design processes.

515
00:25:05,548 --> 00:25:06,889
And some of the people that were recommended

516
00:25:07,189 --> 00:25:09,150
because they were difficult to work with,

517
00:25:09,491 --> 00:25:10,551
and I'm not gonna say their names.

518
00:25:11,552 --> 00:25:14,214
were some of the people that definitely told the most interesting stories.

519
00:25:14,754 --> 00:25:16,955
But as for, do they kick puppies?

520
00:25:17,556 --> 00:25:18,256
I don't know.

521
00:25:18,336 --> 00:25:20,758
Okay, thank you.

522
00:25:20,998 --> 00:25:21,378
Thank you.

523
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,000
Thanks for the talk.

524
00:25:25,261 --> 00:25:26,662
It was really informative.

525
00:25:27,562 --> 00:25:30,144
Did you notice a difference between the independent developers

526
00:25:30,364 --> 00:25:33,166
and the AAA developers in their design process?

527
00:25:33,626 --> 00:25:34,486
Whenever they talked about it?

528
00:25:35,187 --> 00:25:37,568
Yes. That's actually a very, very good question.

529
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:40,250
Yes, independent game designers

530
00:25:43,088 --> 00:25:49,170
I'm sorry if this actually sounds bad, but it seemed like they hadn't lost their hope.

531
00:25:52,832 --> 00:25:58,194
I'm sorry if this sounds bad, but it seems like they still believe that the magic could

532
00:25:58,234 --> 00:26:04,216
happen, whereas the people that I talked to that work for AAA seemed more along the lines

533
00:26:04,296 --> 00:26:05,577
of that it was a business.

534
00:26:06,372 --> 00:26:10,233
that it was a business and that it was a very big machine and that yes, that they were a

535
00:26:10,273 --> 00:26:14,214
game developer, a game designer, but as part of this idea of collaboration, they didn't

536
00:26:14,234 --> 00:26:19,316
maybe have as much agency as they could have. Agency came a lot from the independent game

537
00:26:19,336 --> 00:26:23,997
designers. And this study leans more towards independent game designers simply because

538
00:26:24,057 --> 00:26:28,618
they were the people willing to talk to me. The people in AAA, I got very, very nice letters

539
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:33,940
back saying, no, because we're not sure what you're going to write. So I would say that,

540
00:26:36,663 --> 00:26:39,105
I hate to call it hope, but it's really what it seemed like.

541
00:26:39,125 --> 00:26:40,527
It seemed like anything's possible.

542
00:26:40,587 --> 00:26:42,989
If I just work hard enough, if I just do this thing,

543
00:26:43,510 --> 00:26:45,912
eventually I will be successful.

544
00:26:46,493 --> 00:26:48,154
And that was amazing to hear.

545
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:50,337
Thank you.

546
00:26:50,637 --> 00:26:50,917
Thank you.

547
00:26:57,190 --> 00:26:57,471
Hello.

548
00:26:57,491 --> 00:26:58,532
Hello.

549
00:26:58,612 --> 00:27:02,798
Could you talk a little bit about the process of compiling this into a book and what the

550
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:08,206
focus of the book is, what you hoped it would be or how it changed in the process of making

551
00:27:08,246 --> 00:27:08,286
it?

552
00:27:08,982 --> 00:27:14,564
Of course. So Sean Cameron from Focal Press, not Sean Cameron, wow, I forget his name now.

553
00:27:15,405 --> 00:27:20,748
Anyway, Sean from Focal Press is my editor and the book is called Why We Design Games,

554
00:27:21,208 --> 00:27:27,651
frameworks from Indy to AAA. And each of these people have talked me through the game they

555
00:27:27,691 --> 00:27:31,993
are most proud of. So maybe not the game they're most famous for, but the game they are most

556
00:27:32,094 --> 00:27:32,494
proud of.

557
00:27:33,580 --> 00:27:39,124
And this idea of building on success came from them talking about,

558
00:27:40,445 --> 00:27:41,886
well, which game should I choose, Dana?

559
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:44,508
Which game, you know, the game that made me the most money or the game

560
00:27:44,528 --> 00:27:48,231
where I thought the process was the best or the game where, you know,

561
00:27:48,251 --> 00:27:50,213
the most people responded in these different ways?

562
00:27:50,393 --> 00:27:53,475
And every time I took notes, it kept coming down to

563
00:27:55,202 --> 00:28:00,967
pride and success don't really equal the same thing. So the book will look at the individual

564
00:28:00,987 --> 00:28:05,510
process, so what you'll see is you'll see 55 different games torn apart and then you'll see

565
00:28:05,530 --> 00:28:10,614
their lessons learned as well as their pasts of the best game they ever played or the first

566
00:28:10,654 --> 00:28:15,598
game they ever played and how they became game designers. Awesome, thank you so much.

567
00:28:15,618 --> 00:28:16,258
You're welcome.

568
00:28:20,602 --> 00:28:21,823
Hi, thanks again for giving this talk.

569
00:28:23,993 --> 00:28:28,935
So in all the times that I've spoken with game devs and project managers and everything,

570
00:28:29,435 --> 00:28:31,215
you seem to come across some common themes.

571
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:36,437
Like I would say one of the ones I stumbled upon seemed to be like, you know, nothing's

572
00:28:36,457 --> 00:28:37,358
like black and white.

573
00:28:37,398 --> 00:28:41,079
Like everyone's sort of, there's like this sort of, oh, you know, it sort of depends

574
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,399
on the situation answer.

575
00:28:42,859 --> 00:28:46,541
So I was wondering in the talks and the interviews that you had with people if you seem to come

576
00:28:46,561 --> 00:28:52,403
across those like common core like answers or something like that.

577
00:28:53,258 --> 00:28:59,180
I would say yes. There were some common core answers. As much as people wanted to say that

578
00:28:59,220 --> 00:29:06,441
the money didn't matter, it had to matter. It has to matter in some aspects. But how

579
00:29:06,642 --> 00:29:11,103
much it mattered was really dependent on the individual game designer. And in terms of

580
00:29:11,143 --> 00:29:14,863
the process of actually designing the game, that's what I was talking about in terms of

581
00:29:15,444 --> 00:29:19,885
unconscious competence and things like that. What I got a lot was, and then we designed

582
00:29:19,945 --> 00:29:21,665
the game. I'm like, well, what does that mean?

583
00:29:23,425 --> 00:29:25,146
I need you to bring me through it step by step.

584
00:29:25,486 --> 00:29:29,969
So yes, there were common core answers in things like user testing or how they design

585
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:31,730
music or white boxing and things like that.

586
00:29:32,110 --> 00:29:36,112
In terms of how people think about success, these themes were actually very, very hard

587
00:29:36,152 --> 00:29:40,694
to draw together because what I'm making people seem like here is very black and white when

588
00:29:40,734 --> 00:29:42,695
in reality nobody was.

589
00:29:42,995 --> 00:29:47,978
It just happened to be which box they fit more into less than they're solely about money

590
00:29:48,058 --> 00:29:49,298
or solely about creative freedom.

591
00:29:50,219 --> 00:29:51,079
I really like that answer.

592
00:29:51,099 --> 00:29:51,439
Thank you.

593
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:51,880
Thank you.

594
00:29:54,515 --> 00:29:55,456
Hi, great talk.

595
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:58,419
Did any of the designers that you talked to,

596
00:29:58,439 --> 00:30:01,021
the developers, talk about failures?

597
00:30:01,742 --> 00:30:02,923
A lot of their failures?

598
00:30:03,083 --> 00:30:05,426
Were they comfortable talking about their failures?

599
00:30:06,046 --> 00:30:08,289
Did they not want to talk about their failures?

600
00:30:08,929 --> 00:30:15,331
Yes, okay, so failures. Let's see, the first 17 people I talked to, we talked about failures,

601
00:30:15,591 --> 00:30:22,132
when you really, really just bombed and things went bad. What I found after that was that

602
00:30:22,172 --> 00:30:27,513
those people then took away permission for me to use their stuff in the book. So then

603
00:30:27,573 --> 00:30:29,994
I stopped asking about failures, not all of them.

604
00:30:30,894 --> 00:30:32,896
but about seven out of the 17s,

605
00:30:33,076 --> 00:30:34,517
whose names I cannot mention here

606
00:30:34,698 --> 00:30:36,119
because they took away their permission

607
00:30:36,139 --> 00:30:37,260
for me to actually use that.

608
00:30:37,961 --> 00:30:39,402
Some people were very, very open about it.

609
00:30:39,822 --> 00:30:42,385
It seemed like the more successful and well-known you were,

610
00:30:42,565 --> 00:30:44,086
the more okay you were with the idea

611
00:30:44,126 --> 00:30:47,209
that you had failures out there.

612
00:30:47,649 --> 00:30:49,211
And the less games you had out

613
00:30:49,231 --> 00:30:50,312
and the less successes you had,

614
00:30:50,612 --> 00:30:52,474
the less okay you were with admitting the fact

615
00:30:52,514 --> 00:30:54,976
that you've bombed.

616
00:30:55,777 --> 00:30:56,437
Cool, thank you.

617
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:56,938
Thank you.

618
00:31:03,794 --> 00:31:08,456
Hello, Ben from Google. I had a question on your first question you asked them was what

619
00:31:08,516 --> 00:31:13,698
game like inspired them or they felt ‑‑ was there common themes there for what inspired

620
00:31:13,738 --> 00:31:14,298
all of them?

621
00:31:14,778 --> 00:31:18,780
No. So there were no common themes for the first games they played or the first games

622
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,882
they thought had a really big impact on them. And I think the reason behind that is because

623
00:31:22,902 --> 00:31:28,084
of just the age range of the people. So some people said it was tic‑tac‑toe. Some people

624
00:31:28,104 --> 00:31:31,925
said it was something on an Atari. Some people said it was Mortal Kombat.

625
00:31:32,445 --> 00:31:36,648
Other people were talking about arcade games where they were playing, I'm sorry, Space

626
00:31:36,668 --> 00:31:39,250
Invaders I'm guessing, the things drop down, Space Invaders.

627
00:31:39,650 --> 00:31:44,813
So no, there was no actual common theme for the games that had the most impact on them.

628
00:31:46,254 --> 00:31:47,455
I was actually kind of surprised.

629
00:31:47,495 --> 00:31:50,857
I thought they would be more in tune.

630
00:31:51,077 --> 00:31:51,897
Nobody said Mario.

631
00:31:51,937 --> 00:31:52,338
How's that?

632
00:31:52,558 --> 00:31:53,378
Nobody said Mario.

633
00:31:54,219 --> 00:31:54,539
Thank you.

634
00:31:54,739 --> 00:31:57,141
Hi.

635
00:31:57,721 --> 00:31:57,821
Hi.

636
00:31:57,881 --> 00:31:59,562
Why did you focus just on designers?

637
00:32:01,510 --> 00:32:02,150
as opposed to?

638
00:32:02,170 --> 00:32:04,612
Producers, programmers, artists.

639
00:32:05,413 --> 00:32:07,655
Ah, okay, that is my own ignorance, honestly.

640
00:32:08,115 --> 00:32:12,118
In not being a game designer or a game developer,

641
00:32:12,819 --> 00:32:14,580
in my head, I wanted the people

642
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:17,683
that I thought would be solely responsible for a whole game.

643
00:32:18,163 --> 00:32:19,744
Now I know that's completely not true.

644
00:32:19,764 --> 00:32:20,185
Right.

645
00:32:20,605 --> 00:32:23,707
But having started the book looking at mainly independence,

646
00:32:23,888 --> 00:32:26,289
I decided to simply focus on this person

647
00:32:26,329 --> 00:32:28,351
that was gonna go and make the story, make the game.

648
00:32:28,371 --> 00:32:29,592
Okay.

649
00:32:33,195 --> 00:32:37,356
I think we are out of time and if you would like to talk to me more, I will be in the

650
00:32:37,376 --> 00:32:37,757
wrap‑up space.

651
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:40,298
Please fill out the survey that they have sent you via the Internet.

652
00:32:40,318 --> 00:32:41,278
I think that's all I'm supposed to say.

653
00:32:41,298 --> 00:32:42,018
Thank you very much.

654
00:32:42,078 --> 00:32:42,378
Thank you.

655
00:32:42,398 --> 00:32:42,599
Thank you.

656
00:32:42,619 --> 00:32:42,859
Thank you.

657
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:43,179
Thank you.

658
00:32:43,199 --> 00:32:43,399
Thank you.

659
00:32:43,419 --> 00:32:43,619
Thank you.

660
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:44,079
Thank you.

661
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:44,699
Thank you.

662
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:44,960
Thank you.

663
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:45,180
Thank you.

664
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:45,400
Thank you.

665
00:32:45,420 --> 00:32:45,620
Thank you.

666
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:45,840
Thank you.

667
00:32:45,940 --> 00:32:46,180
Thank you.

668
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:46,460
Thank you.

669
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:46,740
Thank you.
