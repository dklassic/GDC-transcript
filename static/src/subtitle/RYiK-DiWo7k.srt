00:00:06,303 --> 00:00:10,464
Hello and welcome to You Want to Do What?

2
00:00:10,464 --> 00:00:12,625
Non-traditional Pathways into Game Development

3
00:00:12,625 --> 00:00:15,426
as part of the Game Career Seminar at GDC.

4
00:00:15,426 --> 00:00:18,107
So for today's session, we'll each be talking

5
00:00:18,107 --> 00:00:19,807
about our paths into the games industry

6
00:00:19,807 --> 00:00:23,329
and then we'll have a panel about

7
00:00:23,329 --> 00:00:25,909
what we learned on our journeys,

8
00:00:25,909 --> 00:00:27,470
where things have overlapped for us

9
00:00:27,470 --> 00:00:29,311
and what has helped and what hasn't helped.

10
00:00:29,311 --> 00:00:32,652
So we're very excited you can join us.

11
00:00:32,652 --> 00:00:33,592
And before we dive in,

12
00:00:34,889 --> 00:00:37,670
Here are our panelists for today.

13
00:00:37,670 --> 00:00:39,231
We'll each do our own introductions

14
00:00:39,231 --> 00:00:40,931
as part of our individual talks.

15
00:00:40,931 --> 00:00:44,193
So let's start those now with Erika.

16
00:00:44,193 --> 00:00:44,533
All right.

17
00:00:44,533 --> 00:00:47,714
So thank you for coming.

18
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:50,355
My name is Erika Mariko Olsen.

19
00:00:50,815 --> 00:00:58,140
and I currently work as a publishing producer at Humble Bundle. Why am I here? This is the slide

20
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:03,424
just to tell you that I've been associated with different companies or IPs, so I have

21
00:01:03,424 --> 00:01:07,767
been in the industry for a little while, but this wasn't my first career.

22
00:01:09,590 --> 00:01:13,792
So this is what my resume looked like before joining the games

23
00:01:13,792 --> 00:01:17,874
industry. That's not to say that I didn't want to be in the

24
00:01:17,874 --> 00:01:22,616
games industry. I've been a gamer my entire life. But I

25
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:26,818
didn't really have any role models or mentors growing up who

26
00:01:26,818 --> 00:01:30,540
encouraged me in that direction. So I really just had no idea it

27
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,920
was even on the table.

28
00:01:32,999 --> 00:01:41,164
So my past resume, most recruiters and hiring managers would look at this and really see zero connection to the games industry.

29
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:44,586
And yet I've now been in the industry for eight years.

30
00:01:44,586 --> 00:01:51,630
So I'm going to super quickly take us backwards through my games career so that we can kind of explore where those intersect.

31
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,578
So currently working as a publishing producer at Humble Games,

32
00:01:56,578 --> 00:01:58,840
and I also did the same thing for Stadia.

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,924
This is primarily working with external teams on multiple projects.

34
00:02:03,924 --> 00:02:07,347
And before that, I worked at Riot Games as an in-house producer,

35
00:02:07,347 --> 00:02:11,031
focusing on internal teams and their overall work systems.

36
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:16,275
And I moved through a couple of different roles at Riot.

37
00:02:16,275 --> 00:02:19,278
And I started my career in the games industry,

38
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:20,959
full-time at least, in recruiting.

39
00:02:22,834 --> 00:02:27,358
So I'm going to talk a little bit about how did I get here,

40
00:02:27,358 --> 00:02:29,920
because it wasn't 100% intentional.

41
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,123
But I do think it happened because of these four things,

42
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:36,506
networking and volunteering, timing and luck,

43
00:02:36,506 --> 00:02:39,188
identifying skills without perfect context,

44
00:02:39,188 --> 00:02:40,649
and convincing others.

45
00:02:42,618 --> 00:02:47,260
So networking and volunteering. After graduating college, I was

46
00:02:47,260 --> 00:02:51,823
volunteering at Sakura Con and Anime Expo. It's, you know, not

47
00:02:51,823 --> 00:02:55,384
quite the video games industry, but it is adjacent. There's lots

48
00:02:55,384 --> 00:02:59,327
of anime lovers in the games industry. And

49
00:02:59,896 --> 00:03:19,782
The thing to note about networking is that it's really not just about meeting the right people. It's an opportunity for you to be building your social skills, hopefully making friendships that last, you know, beyond just the one time. You're building credibility in a space that you care about, especially with volunteer work.

50
00:03:20,122 --> 00:03:22,283
and you're making your skills and passions known,

51
00:03:22,283 --> 00:03:24,984
and you're creating an interesting bullet point

52
00:03:24,984 --> 00:03:26,244
on your resume.

53
00:03:26,244 --> 00:03:29,505
A lot of recruiters look at these things on my resume

54
00:03:29,505 --> 00:03:31,145
and they just want to know more about it

55
00:03:31,145 --> 00:03:33,866
because it's kind of unique.

56
00:03:33,866 --> 00:03:36,687
But a key concept here is to be willing to give

57
00:03:36,687 --> 00:03:39,587
before expecting to receive.

58
00:03:39,587 --> 00:03:42,948
And one little bonus I'd like to add about volunteering,

59
00:03:42,948 --> 00:03:46,009
because I do think it is the best form of networking.

60
00:03:46,517 --> 00:03:59,315
If you, for example, you know, maybe you have student loan debt and you can't necessarily afford to attend the types of events that you want to, volunteering is a really great place to get in for free.

61
00:03:59,315 --> 00:04:03,301
Alright, so now timing and luck. So

62
00:04:03,842 --> 00:04:09,303
we don't really get the opportunities, we don't get control over what opportunities are presented

63
00:04:09,303 --> 00:04:15,884
to us, but you have control over saying yes or no, and you can try to maximize the number of

64
00:04:15,884 --> 00:04:22,706
opportunities that come your way through that prerequisite networking. The reality is that a

65
00:04:22,706 --> 00:04:28,787
lot of jobs in the games industry need to be filled really fast, and so you want to be remembered.

66
00:04:29,127 --> 00:04:32,891
so that people will think to reach out to you when the time comes.

67
00:04:32,891 --> 00:04:36,975
A lot of times there isn't really time to have a thorough interview process

68
00:04:36,975 --> 00:04:39,057
and consider a whole lot of candidates.

69
00:04:39,057 --> 00:04:43,581
Again, they're just trying to get somebody to do the job fast.

70
00:04:43,581 --> 00:04:49,587
And so, because I had proven to be reliable and organized during my volunteer work,

71
00:04:49,587 --> 00:04:54,711
I was remembered and asked by another volunteer to help on BlazBlue Chronophantasma.

72
00:04:57,082 --> 00:04:59,641
All right, so here's where it starts to get a little bit harder.

73
00:05:00,646 --> 00:05:07,711
You want to be able to break down the things that you do into their most basic pieces.

74
00:05:07,711 --> 00:05:13,135
And then if there is another role in the industry that you're looking to transition to,

75
00:05:13,135 --> 00:05:19,420
I encourage you to talk to people in those roles and really break down what is it that they do.

76
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:26,965
And you'll often find that there's a lot of similarities and you'll be able to articulate them.

77
00:05:27,505 --> 00:05:31,267
even though they were not necessarily in the same context.

78
00:05:31,267 --> 00:05:34,828
So just for an example here,

79
00:05:34,828 --> 00:05:38,269
here's some of the typical things that you might do

80
00:05:38,269 --> 00:05:41,690
in these two non-games industry roles,

81
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:44,531
but how can we rearticulate them

82
00:05:44,531 --> 00:05:47,733
in a way that applies to being a producer?

83
00:05:47,733 --> 00:05:50,393
And so, as you can see, like, you know,

84
00:05:50,393 --> 00:05:53,034
a lot of this stuff is just rewording it

85
00:05:53,034 --> 00:05:55,235
into a way that applies into.

86
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,422
our roles in the industry.

87
00:05:58,422 --> 00:06:01,183
And your previous experience may not

88
00:06:01,183 --> 00:06:04,004
be one-to-one with what you want to do next,

89
00:06:04,004 --> 00:06:09,186
but the combination of your previous experiences

90
00:06:09,186 --> 00:06:13,888
can merge into checking all of the boxes for the next thing.

91
00:06:13,888 --> 00:06:16,509
So again, it's not perfect context, obviously,

92
00:06:16,509 --> 00:06:18,269
because it's not from the games industry,

93
00:06:18,269 --> 00:06:21,110
but they are the same transferable skills.

94
00:06:21,110 --> 00:06:21,270
All right.

95
00:06:24,012 --> 00:06:26,873
So now the actual hard part is convincing others.

96
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:29,615
There are a lot of people in the industry

97
00:06:29,615 --> 00:06:31,176
who look for that perfect context.

98
00:06:31,176 --> 00:06:34,737
They want you to have games industry experience in order

99
00:06:34,737 --> 00:06:36,158
to work in the games industry.

100
00:06:36,158 --> 00:06:40,160
And it is kind of this Catch-22 situation.

101
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:42,462
There are people with a very fixed mindset,

102
00:06:42,462 --> 00:06:44,243
and they're not going to be convinced.

103
00:06:44,243 --> 00:06:46,984
But there obviously are people who can be convinced.

104
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,606
We have a whole panel of people who took different routes

105
00:06:49,606 --> 00:06:52,027
into the games industry.

106
00:06:52,027 --> 00:06:52,127
So.

107
00:06:53,057 --> 00:06:55,219
Just remember that you don't have to do it alone.

108
00:06:55,219 --> 00:06:58,601
You will find allies and advocates and mentors

109
00:06:58,601 --> 00:07:01,704
who are going to help you and are going to talk you

110
00:07:01,704 --> 00:07:04,427
through breaking down all of your core competencies

111
00:07:04,427 --> 00:07:07,349
and skills and applying them into the industry.

112
00:07:07,349 --> 00:07:10,292
So we're out there, and we're willing to help you

113
00:07:10,292 --> 00:07:11,813
if you'll let us.

114
00:07:11,813 --> 00:07:15,136
And with that, I'm going to pass it on to Osama.

115
00:07:17,192 --> 00:07:17,993
Thank you, Erica.

116
00:07:17,993 --> 00:07:20,454
Well, hello, my name's Osama Dorias,

117
00:07:20,454 --> 00:07:23,075
and I'm the lead game designer at WB Games in Montreal.

118
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:25,716
I'm a game design teacher at Dawson College,

119
00:07:25,716 --> 00:07:28,917
and one of the three Habibis on the Habibis podcast.

120
00:07:28,917 --> 00:07:32,238
Here are some of the games that I've contributed to

121
00:07:32,238 --> 00:07:34,079
over the last 14 years in the industry.

122
00:07:36,217 --> 00:07:39,019
I'd like to start my story at the beginning.

123
00:07:39,019 --> 00:07:41,262
In 1979, a young boy was born in Iraq.

124
00:07:41,262 --> 00:07:43,864
Little did he know he was about to embark

125
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:47,087
on a great adventure that spanned many continents,

126
00:07:47,087 --> 00:07:48,809
experiences, and careers.

127
00:07:49,885 --> 00:07:53,428
As most kids do, I loved making up games as a kid.

128
00:07:53,428 --> 00:07:57,491
And I do so on the playground with my friends and siblings.

129
00:07:57,491 --> 00:07:58,311
But it didn't stop there.

130
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:03,274
I actually also loved designing card games and board games.

131
00:08:03,274 --> 00:08:05,936
One of my earliest memories is asking my father

132
00:08:05,936 --> 00:08:08,178
to bring home an empty pizza box.

133
00:08:08,178 --> 00:08:10,820
He was baffled, but he complied.

134
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:14,562
And when I had that box, I created a board game

135
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:15,483
inside of it.

136
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:21,042
So the inside of the box was where the game was, and when you closed the box,

137
00:08:21,042 --> 00:08:26,646
that was the container of the game. And I still find that incredibly clever to this day.

138
00:08:26,646 --> 00:08:33,930
As I got older, I moved on to making maps for video games like Duke Nukem, StarCraft,

139
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:40,474
Heroes of Might and Magic, Unreal Tournament. This is one of the maps I made in the back.

140
00:08:40,474 --> 00:08:44,637
This hobby persisted into my 20s, but I'm getting ahead of myself.

141
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:52,646
In addition to making games and maps for games as a kid, I also loved legos and building things.

142
00:08:52,646 --> 00:08:58,589
So naturally, I wanted to be an architect. That was my dream. I wanted to design gorgeous,

143
00:08:58,589 --> 00:09:02,950
elaborate spaces. This was my dream from a very young age,

144
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:07,512
but right before applying to colleges, I kind of had a change of heart.

145
00:09:08,411 --> 00:09:13,995
and suddenly I felt directionless. I didn't know what to do with my life.

146
00:09:13,995 --> 00:09:18,438
That's a really scary feeling, especially for a 17-year-old.

147
00:09:18,438 --> 00:09:22,541
I decided to major in political science because it was a study that interested me,

148
00:09:22,541 --> 00:09:25,583
even though I really didn't have any real desire to work in the field.

149
00:09:25,583 --> 00:09:33,268
And after university, I got a job as a shipping agent. I kind of had a love-hate relationship

150
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:37,971
with it. I loved going on ships and meeting the captain and the crew from all over the world,

151
00:09:38,881 --> 00:09:44,164
But I hated doing the customs paperwork.

152
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:47,246
I did learn a lot from my time as a shipping agent, though.

153
00:09:47,246 --> 00:09:51,909
I had to have impeccable work ethic and punctuality.

154
00:09:51,909 --> 00:09:53,550
Paperwork had to be ready on time.

155
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:55,532
I couldn't be late or the ship would be delayed,

156
00:09:55,532 --> 00:09:58,674
and that could cost millions of dollars to the client.

157
00:09:58,674 --> 00:10:02,636
I learned to be organized and have impeccable attention

158
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,837
to detail.

159
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,119
One wrong number in the wrong field

160
00:10:06,119 --> 00:10:07,700
could cost a small fortune.

161
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:11,883
I learned to respect process, even when I didn't like it.

162
00:10:11,883 --> 00:10:14,826
I learned to communicate and negotiate.

163
00:10:14,826 --> 00:10:18,569
But most importantly, I developed my emotional intelligence.

164
00:10:18,569 --> 00:10:21,031
When you work with so many people from all over the world

165
00:10:21,031 --> 00:10:23,473
with different customs and backgrounds,

166
00:10:23,473 --> 00:10:26,136
you quickly learn how to identify shared values

167
00:10:26,136 --> 00:10:27,577
and how to speak to those values.

168
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:34,514
I eventually quit that job and I started freelancing as a graphic and web designer.

169
00:10:34,514 --> 00:10:35,335
I was self-taught.

170
00:10:35,335 --> 00:10:37,456
I dabbled in it in my teens.

171
00:10:37,456 --> 00:10:40,578
I made a website for my dad's business at one point.

172
00:10:40,578 --> 00:10:45,302
And I'm a pretty fast learner, so it didn't take me long to line up some clients and get

173
00:10:45,302 --> 00:10:45,802
some work.

174
00:10:45,802 --> 00:10:48,664
I eventually learned Flash.

175
00:10:48,664 --> 00:10:51,226
And then, of course, made Flash games.

176
00:10:51,226 --> 00:10:53,528
They were pretty awful.

177
00:10:55,277 --> 00:11:02,123
As a freelancer, I had to learn how to manage my own time and tasks, as well as manage client expectations.

178
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:05,826
I was a team of one, so I had to be self-motivated and resourceful.

179
00:11:05,826 --> 00:11:10,490
There was no one to give me answers or to bail me out if something went wrong.

180
00:11:10,490 --> 00:11:13,232
I also picked up some hard skills along the way.

181
00:11:13,232 --> 00:11:18,297
I learned how to script, which eventually helped me prototype.

182
00:11:18,297 --> 00:11:22,600
I learned how to use Photoshop, which helped me create convincing mockups and fakes.

183
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,599
And most importantly, I learned how to iterate.

184
00:11:26,599 --> 00:11:27,881
I didn't have a choice.

185
00:11:27,881 --> 00:11:29,443
When you're working with customers,

186
00:11:29,443 --> 00:11:32,346
they're never happy with the first version of anything.

187
00:11:32,346 --> 00:11:36,391
I had to develop thick skin and learn not to get overly

188
00:11:36,391 --> 00:11:38,153
attached to what I made.

189
00:11:38,153 --> 00:11:40,076
That is one of the most valuable skills

190
00:11:40,076 --> 00:11:41,898
I have as a designer right now.

191
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:46,680
At that point, I'd been making games my entire life,

192
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,000
but I had never even considered a job in game dev.

193
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:52,181
Everything changed when my friend Ahmed

194
00:11:52,181 --> 00:11:53,382
became a game designer.

195
00:11:53,382 --> 00:11:56,322
See, Ahmed also studied political science,

196
00:11:56,322 --> 00:11:58,043
and he was brown like me.

197
00:11:58,043 --> 00:11:59,243
And representation matters.

198
00:11:59,243 --> 00:12:02,084
Seeing him make it opened my eyes,

199
00:12:02,084 --> 00:12:04,384
and I knew I had found my colleague.

200
00:12:04,384 --> 00:12:07,345
My entire life had prepared me for this moment,

201
00:12:07,345 --> 00:12:09,586
and Ahmed thus became my first mentor.

202
00:12:10,564 --> 00:12:14,026
And over the next six months, he guided me in creating a portfolio.

203
00:12:14,026 --> 00:12:17,007
I had plenty of things already to put in a portfolio.

204
00:12:17,007 --> 00:12:19,809
I mean, I've been making things my entire life.

205
00:12:19,809 --> 00:12:24,931
So he helped me just parse the bad from the not so bad and make the good even better.

206
00:12:24,931 --> 00:12:30,494
And I must have applied to over 100 different companies at that time, all over the world.

207
00:12:30,494 --> 00:12:32,475
And I initially didn't hear back from any of them.

208
00:12:34,432 --> 00:12:38,233
I eventually got one interview, and that, luckily for me,

209
00:12:38,233 --> 00:12:39,953
translated to a game designer job.

210
00:12:39,953 --> 00:12:42,294
And I've been a game designer ever

211
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:45,035
since, leveraging all of the aforementioned skills

212
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,935
in the process.

213
00:12:46,935 --> 00:12:47,775
And that's my story.

214
00:12:47,775 --> 00:12:49,176
Thank you.

215
00:12:49,176 --> 00:12:50,136
Take it away, Marina.

216
00:12:50,136 --> 00:12:53,917
Thank you so much, Osama.

217
00:12:53,917 --> 00:12:54,997
Hello, everyone.

218
00:12:54,997 --> 00:12:57,238
I'm Marina Diaz.

219
00:12:57,238 --> 00:12:58,358
I'm 27 years old.

220
00:12:58,358 --> 00:13:01,359
I'm the CEO of my own company, Free of Caps Games.

221
00:13:01,843 --> 00:13:06,533
I'm also the lead designer of Dordogne with Angèle Secoeur Studios in France,

222
00:13:06,533 --> 00:13:11,464
and I have an undergrad in Italian and German and a master's degree in game design.

223
00:13:11,982 --> 00:13:16,025
And some of the awards that I won were Forbes 30 under 30,

224
00:13:16,025 --> 00:13:22,270
Game Dev Heroes 2020, and I'm also part of After Crew and other associations in the games industry.

225
00:13:22,270 --> 00:13:28,135
And this is what you normally see about me if you look for me on the internet.

226
00:13:28,135 --> 00:13:33,160
But now I want to tell you about what you don't see, but it's very important to know regarding

227
00:13:33,160 --> 00:13:39,705
career when you are considering starting in the games industry or even doing whatever you want to do.

228
00:13:41,235 --> 00:13:46,317
So, first of all, I wanted to become a vet. When I was a kid, I had lots and lots of dreams,

229
00:13:46,317 --> 00:13:51,998
but the biggest was to become a vet. I really loved animals, and I still love them today.

230
00:13:51,998 --> 00:13:56,879
However, my biggest dream was changing quite often. Someday I wanted to be a vet,

231
00:13:56,879 --> 00:14:01,520
any other day I wanted to be a paleontologist, any other day I wanted to be a journalist, and so on.

232
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:06,221
But then I also discovered the big truth, that it's also one of the things that get me

233
00:14:06,221 --> 00:14:10,002
a bit far from the games industry, and it's that I'm super bad at math.

234
00:14:10,002 --> 00:14:10,262
So,

235
00:14:10,633 --> 00:14:18,700
Basically, when you're not good at math, lots of things cut from your way. But then it's when life

236
00:14:18,700 --> 00:14:25,205
started happening. And when I was five, my dad suffered a heart stroke. And then my mom needed

237
00:14:25,205 --> 00:14:30,970
to do everything by herself and taking care of my dad. You can see here my parents. And two years

238
00:14:30,970 --> 00:14:35,233
after that, my dad started suffering from depression. And a while later, he was diagnosed

239
00:14:35,233 --> 00:14:37,315
with bipolar disorder. So basically,

240
00:14:37,943 --> 00:14:43,286
When these kind of things happen at home, and I was also an only child,

241
00:14:43,286 --> 00:14:48,370
basically it was very traumatic for me because I really didn't know what was happening at home.

242
00:14:48,370 --> 00:14:53,053
And that means that often there's no room for dreaming anymore because you need to grow very

243
00:14:53,053 --> 00:14:59,777
fast. And basically it was like a whole mess. I didn't understand what was happening at home.

244
00:15:00,586 --> 00:15:03,308
And that led me to teenager depression.

245
00:15:03,308 --> 00:15:05,509
And basically I used to stay up in the nights

246
00:15:05,509 --> 00:15:07,130
until the morning on my computer

247
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:09,552
or not sleeping at all during days.

248
00:15:09,552 --> 00:15:11,093
I used to have great grades,

249
00:15:11,093 --> 00:15:13,494
but then I stopped going to school

250
00:15:13,494 --> 00:15:17,897
and missed a whole year that I needed to repeat, of course.

251
00:15:17,897 --> 00:15:20,479
Then I surrounded myself with bad people

252
00:15:20,479 --> 00:15:23,301
and then things like tobacco and alcohol up here in my life.

253
00:15:23,873 --> 00:15:26,715
And then as a result of that pretty bad environment,

254
00:15:26,715 --> 00:15:28,476
I ended in an abusive relationship

255
00:15:28,476 --> 00:15:30,717
that I can say I was lucky enough to survive.

256
00:15:30,717 --> 00:15:33,838
And then at the school,

257
00:15:33,838 --> 00:15:36,359
people were not supporting me very much either.

258
00:15:36,359 --> 00:15:38,420
And the teacher said to my parents

259
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:41,182
that I was never going to achieve anything in my life.

260
00:15:41,182 --> 00:15:45,464
So you can see it's not like the best of the best,

261
00:15:45,464 --> 00:15:47,164
but then things have started changing.

262
00:15:47,164 --> 00:15:50,426
Even though I got lots of bad things

263
00:15:50,426 --> 00:15:51,587
that were happening around me.

264
00:15:52,274 --> 00:15:57,918
around me, I found shelter in studying again. It was kind of like my way to escape from all those

265
00:15:57,918 --> 00:16:03,781
bad things. And during the rest of high school, I also changed school. I got great grades and

266
00:16:03,781 --> 00:16:08,524
honorific mentions. That was really nice. And then all of that gave me the power to

267
00:16:08,524 --> 00:16:14,348
live that abusive relationship, even though in that case, I also think I was extremely lucky.

268
00:16:15,038 --> 00:16:24,062
But then thanks to my grades in high school, I got a grant for going to uni and I decided to study languages and literature, Italian and German specifically.

269
00:16:24,062 --> 00:16:27,683
You can see me here the day of my uni graduation.

270
00:16:27,683 --> 00:16:30,504
That was not super far ago, just in 2017.

271
00:16:30,504 --> 00:16:36,606
And then after uni, when I thought that I found my thing, I got lost again because I couldn't find a job.

272
00:16:37,353 --> 00:16:40,375
So basically I started working in digital marketing,

273
00:16:40,375 --> 00:16:42,377
first as a trainee and then as a manager

274
00:16:42,377 --> 00:16:43,417
in the fashion industry.

275
00:16:43,417 --> 00:16:46,359
And I thought I liked it a lot at the beginning

276
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:48,380
but then I really felt I was not doing

277
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,541
what I really wanted to do.

278
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,922
That was basically to kind of help making change

279
00:16:51,922 --> 00:16:56,105
and helping people to improve their lives.

280
00:16:56,105 --> 00:16:58,587
So then one of these days I was a bit sad.

281
00:16:58,587 --> 00:17:01,829
My mom suggested to me to go into games

282
00:17:01,829 --> 00:17:05,631
as it was like really the only thing that I kept being.

283
00:17:06,133 --> 00:17:09,635
Constant about and you know, like I come from in Spain

284
00:17:09,635 --> 00:17:13,198
So when my mom said that to me, I was like you are really crazy

285
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:19,463
That's impossible because our community in spain is small and there are not much funding for game developers

286
00:17:19,463 --> 00:17:20,683
so basically it was like

287
00:17:21,188 --> 00:17:28,254
a crazy idea. But I decided to follow what my mom said because a tiny thing remained in my heart

288
00:17:28,254 --> 00:17:33,598
with what she said. So I decided to apply to a master's degree at Brunel University London and

289
00:17:33,598 --> 00:17:39,443
I really didn't tell anyone about it, just one friend. And then in the meantime I started making

290
00:17:39,443 --> 00:17:45,888
my own games with Bitsy and started going to local games events in Madrid after my work hours.

291
00:17:47,371 --> 00:17:54,614
So then one day in March in 2018, I got the letter from Brunel University in London telling me that I

292
00:17:54,614 --> 00:18:02,017
got accepted and I couldn't believe it, but then the MA cost almost 8,000 pounds and we couldn't

293
00:18:02,017 --> 00:18:07,939
afford it. I still remember when I called my dad telling him this amazing thing and he was so angry

294
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:12,101
at me, but he was not angry at me because he didn't want me to do it. He was angry because

295
00:18:12,101 --> 00:18:16,663
he didn't know how to help me in that moment, but then my parents...

296
00:18:17,457 --> 00:18:22,118
asked to the bank if they could help them with a loan and it was possible.

297
00:18:22,118 --> 00:18:25,059
So my parents did that for me and I'm super grateful today.

298
00:18:25,059 --> 00:18:29,921
And then from my side, I also needed to ask for a loan in the UK so I could survive in London

299
00:18:29,921 --> 00:18:33,843
because it was impossible to get a job and at the same time study.

300
00:18:33,843 --> 00:18:39,124
So I got ten thousand pounds that I finished paying this year and then.

301
00:18:40,616 --> 00:18:46,879
happened that I moved to the UK, to London, and during my remain 2018-2019, I was extremely lucky.

302
00:18:46,879 --> 00:18:52,002
I made amazing friends in London, my teachers at Brunel helped me a whole lot,

303
00:18:52,002 --> 00:18:57,965
and I was very lucky that I got an IGBA Velocity grant to attend UBC in San Francisco,

304
00:18:57,965 --> 00:19:04,549
and I did things like going to Parajam in Thailand with my best friend to make games in about 14 days.

305
00:19:05,412 --> 00:19:08,354
After all these adventures, and once I finished my MA,

306
00:19:08,354 --> 00:19:09,575
I still needed a job.

307
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:11,776
Many times, in interviews, I was turned down

308
00:19:11,776 --> 00:19:14,699
because I didn't have the experience in the studio,

309
00:19:14,699 --> 00:19:16,860
even though they liked my work.

310
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:19,322
And then is when I started working as a lead designer

311
00:19:19,322 --> 00:19:23,245
with Angine Sequa, because at that moment,

312
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,226
they didn't have money.

313
00:19:24,226 --> 00:19:26,708
So I started helping them for free.

314
00:19:26,708 --> 00:19:28,289
But it was good for me because it

315
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:30,631
was kind of an excuse for working with a studio anyway.

316
00:19:30,631 --> 00:19:34,133
And then I found a game set, a charity in the UK.

317
00:19:34,913 --> 00:19:38,275
that hired me as their operations coordinator.

318
00:19:38,275 --> 00:19:42,117
This experience helped me to stay in London

319
00:19:42,117 --> 00:19:46,300
and not going back to Spain.

320
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:50,842
And then 2021 arrived, and basically in April, 2021,

321
00:19:50,842 --> 00:19:53,284
I was featuring Forbes 30 under 30 Europe.

322
00:19:53,284 --> 00:19:55,625
That was like a big achievement

323
00:19:55,625 --> 00:19:59,707
because they basically highlighted my experience

324
00:19:59,707 --> 00:20:01,088
as an emotional game designer.

325
00:20:01,088 --> 00:20:03,049
That is something that I fight for every day

326
00:20:03,049 --> 00:20:04,230
in the game industry.

327
00:20:04,775 --> 00:20:08,496
And then I was very lucky that I could

328
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:11,096
lead a project about identifying your own emotions

329
00:20:11,096 --> 00:20:13,697
and accepting them instead of dismissing them.

330
00:20:13,697 --> 00:20:17,878
And then I keep working with Ordóñez today and dreaming

331
00:20:17,878 --> 00:20:18,378
again.

332
00:20:18,378 --> 00:20:21,099
And what I want to say with all of this,

333
00:20:21,099 --> 00:20:24,580
basically keep dreaming and that dreams are also self-care.

334
00:20:24,580 --> 00:20:29,141
I really know that life can be pretty harsh and it's not easy,

335
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:32,562
but there are sometimes some small actions

336
00:20:32,562 --> 00:20:33,902
that we can take.

337
00:20:34,139 --> 00:20:39,141
from today to pursue our dreams and being a step closer to make them true. So, for me,

338
00:20:39,141 --> 00:20:46,584
when I started in the games industry and, you know, like going with my work in digital marketing at

339
00:20:46,584 --> 00:20:53,026
the same time, for me it was to take 20 minutes per day to make some games, anything I could,

340
00:20:53,026 --> 00:20:58,588
you know, anything I could make in that time. Sometimes it was a bit more, you know, whatever

341
00:20:58,588 --> 00:20:59,228
it helps you.

342
00:20:59,713 --> 00:21:01,874
Then that you are important, you come first.

343
00:21:01,874 --> 00:21:04,275
I burned out myself several times in this industry,

344
00:21:04,275 --> 00:21:06,296
and I don't recommend it.

345
00:21:06,296 --> 00:21:10,257
It's really not worth, and you can do so much better change

346
00:21:10,257 --> 00:21:11,578
if you feel yourself good.

347
00:21:11,578 --> 00:21:15,739
And that's so that you can keep with example for others

348
00:21:15,739 --> 00:21:16,700
coming behind you.

349
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,741
And then be kind to yourself and treat you with respect.

350
00:21:19,741 --> 00:21:22,042
Thank you so much.

351
00:21:22,042 --> 00:21:27,464
And now I give the word again to the amazing Jaycee Lau.

352
00:21:27,464 --> 00:21:27,704
Cool.

353
00:21:27,704 --> 00:21:28,684
Thanks, Marina.

354
00:21:29,484 --> 00:21:37,171
Hi, I'm Dr. JC Lau and I'm a producer at Harebrained Schemes and I also serve on the

355
00:21:37,171 --> 00:21:40,895
board of directors for Global Game Jam and the Seattle chapter of the IGDA.

356
00:21:42,312 --> 00:21:45,895
Now, in my time in games, I've been a scrum master,

357
00:21:45,895 --> 00:21:49,138
I've been a test engineer, I've been a project coordinator,

358
00:21:49,138 --> 00:21:53,042
I've worked in QA, I've written scripts,

359
00:21:53,042 --> 00:21:54,984
I've had a job translating American English

360
00:21:54,984 --> 00:21:57,366
into Australian and New Zealand English,

361
00:21:57,366 --> 00:21:59,027
and that's all a lot of stuff.

362
00:21:59,027 --> 00:22:01,750
But before I was a game developer,

363
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:04,492
I was a college professor of moral and political philosophy,

364
00:22:04,492 --> 00:22:06,814
and then before that, I was a family lawyer.

365
00:22:07,435 --> 00:22:12,439
So in my journey into games, I've had to develop a lot of different skill sets.

366
00:22:12,439 --> 00:22:18,365
And what I'm going to talk about today is something that I learned on this journey,

367
00:22:18,365 --> 00:22:24,330
which is basically that when you have hard skills, hard skills are important,

368
00:22:24,330 --> 00:22:33,398
but soft skills are importanter. And I'll talk about what I mean by this shortly. But first,

369
00:22:34,473 --> 00:22:36,614
Here's the thing, let's go back a little.

370
00:22:36,614 --> 00:22:41,877
I knew as a kid, I wanted to go into games and I just didn't know how to do it.

371
00:22:41,877 --> 00:22:43,879
Game schools weren't really a thing when I was young.

372
00:22:43,879 --> 00:22:49,722
And my degrees were in history, philosophy, political science, and law.

373
00:22:49,722 --> 00:22:55,206
And I developed a whole bunch of skills around just like being a lawyer and being

374
00:22:55,206 --> 00:22:58,328
an academic and argument and research.

375
00:22:58,328 --> 00:23:03,171
And I didn't know how to apply them to games or whether these skills were even

376
00:23:03,171 --> 00:23:03,671
relevant.

377
00:23:03,964 --> 00:23:10,977
at all. So my question was basically, how do people enter the game industry from

378
00:23:10,977 --> 00:23:15,606
like what I was doing, a completely different area, and succeed?

379
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:18,678
And now success is really important here

380
00:23:18,678 --> 00:23:22,801
because I also knew the games industry was relatively volatile

381
00:23:22,801 --> 00:23:23,902
and it has a high turnover.

382
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:26,204
So for example, the studies that have

383
00:23:26,204 --> 00:23:30,707
shown that the average career lifespan for a game developer

384
00:23:30,707 --> 00:23:31,628
is five years.

385
00:23:31,628 --> 00:23:33,689
And I wanted to get into games, but I

386
00:23:33,689 --> 00:23:37,012
wanted to make sure I could make that change into development

387
00:23:37,012 --> 00:23:40,114
in a way that was still sustainable.

388
00:23:40,114 --> 00:23:42,536
So I devised a strategy.

389
00:23:43,829 --> 00:23:47,250
As a lawyer and an academic, I knew how to do research.

390
00:23:47,250 --> 00:23:53,511
So I just started by doing a bunch of research about what games were and what roles there were in games.

391
00:23:53,511 --> 00:24:01,813
And I knew I wanted to be in the game making part and not so much publishing, for example,

392
00:24:01,813 --> 00:24:12,195
but without any actual expertise in art or design or programming, I ruled out those areas of games.

393
00:24:12,732 --> 00:24:19,314
The alternative was I went back to school for a couple more years, and at this point in my career,

394
00:24:19,314 --> 00:24:26,797
I really didn't want to do that. So I also looked at what skills I did have and how I could align

395
00:24:26,797 --> 00:24:32,238
those with any particular roles. I'll talk a little bit more about skills later, but based

396
00:24:32,238 --> 00:24:37,700
on what my skills were and what my interests were, I was looking at production. So once I had my

397
00:24:37,700 --> 00:24:39,101
research in order,

398
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,323
I set about getting ready to make that jump into games.

399
00:24:43,323 --> 00:24:52,872
So I took a couple of computer science courses online and I also did some stuff like playing

400
00:24:52,872 --> 00:24:57,937
with Game Maker and Unity, so at least I knew something about the technical side of making

401
00:24:57,937 --> 00:24:58,358
games.

402
00:24:59,277 --> 00:25:06,762
I went to some networking events and I just went there and listened to people talk about games.

403
00:25:06,762 --> 00:25:10,625
And in doing this, I learned a lot about what the landscape of the industry was like,

404
00:25:10,625 --> 00:25:15,849
and I could also look for people who could be potential mentors or sponsors for me.

405
00:25:15,849 --> 00:25:22,934
And this one I have some thoughts about. So if money is a consideration, it's not a bad idea

406
00:25:22,934 --> 00:25:27,997
to save some. And I did this for practical purposes while I was still employed as a

407
00:25:27,997 --> 00:25:28,658
college professor.

408
00:25:29,304 --> 00:25:34,687
So in case I didn't get a job in games right away, I had something to fall back on.

409
00:25:34,687 --> 00:25:42,251
And after all that, I felt like I was ready to apply for jobs. And I worked on

410
00:25:42,251 --> 00:25:49,235
my resume and submitted it to a lot of different places.

411
00:25:49,235 --> 00:25:54,838
Now, in applying for game jobs, I relied heavily on my soft skills.

412
00:25:55,707 --> 00:26:05,074
And assuming that you have the technical or hard skills for a role, soft skills are really the things that will set you apart from other applicants.

413
00:26:05,074 --> 00:26:12,199
So soft skills are required for all jobs and roles, but they're usually a lot more difficult to cultivate than hard skills.

414
00:26:12,199 --> 00:26:20,545
And part of this is because they're a lot more nebulous, or the quantity, the quality at which you can do them is much more subjective than hard skills.

415
00:26:20,545 --> 00:26:21,246
So for example,

416
00:26:22,164 --> 00:26:25,588
Can you write an API or can you do a letting pass?

417
00:26:25,588 --> 00:26:28,210
Very different types of questions from,

418
00:26:28,210 --> 00:26:30,893
can you empathetically support your team through a pandemic?

419
00:26:32,444 --> 00:26:36,107
Now, in my experience, both when I was applying for jobs,

420
00:26:36,107 --> 00:26:39,530
and even now as someone that is involved

421
00:26:39,530 --> 00:26:41,932
in hiring other developers,

422
00:26:41,932 --> 00:26:44,794
people focus on soft skills a lot more than you might think.

423
00:26:44,794 --> 00:26:48,236
And what I'm gonna do is talk about three skills

424
00:26:48,236 --> 00:26:49,958
that I found to be really effective here.

425
00:26:49,958 --> 00:26:53,020
And those are collaboration, communication,

426
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,282
and having a growth mindset.

427
00:26:55,282 --> 00:26:58,925
So firstly, collaboration.

428
00:26:59,754 --> 00:27:02,455
Collaboration is the ability to be a good team player.

429
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:05,077
So unless you plan to be a solo dev,

430
00:27:05,077 --> 00:27:07,278
collaboration is absolutely essential

431
00:27:07,278 --> 00:27:08,979
to having a functional team.

432
00:27:08,979 --> 00:27:11,280
You're gonna come across a lot of different people

433
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,101
with a lot of different personality types

434
00:27:13,101 --> 00:27:17,643
and being able to navigate your interactions with them

435
00:27:17,643 --> 00:27:18,924
is a really vital skill to have.

436
00:27:19,688 --> 00:27:23,591
This is also especially important if you're working across teams or across functions.

437
00:27:23,591 --> 00:27:29,335
So if you're an artist, but you can kind of work with an engineer and understand what they're talking about and so on.

438
00:27:29,335 --> 00:27:34,319
So the better that you can work with different types of people, the more effective as a team member you'll be.

439
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,222
So secondly is communication.

440
00:27:40,039 --> 00:27:43,401
Communication deals with questions about understanding and being understood.

441
00:27:43,401 --> 00:27:46,823
So are you able to articulate your view clearly?

442
00:27:46,823 --> 00:27:48,904
Do people know what you mean when you say something?

443
00:27:48,904 --> 00:27:53,986
Communication is vital to making a game because it requires that people understand

444
00:27:53,986 --> 00:27:58,609
what you're saying so you can collaborate better and be aligned on your goals.

445
00:27:58,609 --> 00:28:01,410
Now, for me, communication also.

446
00:28:02,557 --> 00:28:10,220
includes things like knowing when not to talk and being able to read social cues and also holding

447
00:28:10,220 --> 00:28:15,302
space for others to speak. Okay, and finally, the third one I'm going to talk about here is

448
00:28:15,302 --> 00:28:21,945
growth mindset. Now, this is the ability to understand how you like to learn and look inward

449
00:28:21,945 --> 00:28:25,086
at what you have learned and make plans for how you will continue to get better.

450
00:28:25,959 --> 00:28:30,241
Having a growth mindset also prevents you from stagnating on your hard skills,

451
00:28:30,241 --> 00:28:37,806
because you will continue to learn as new, like, hard skills develop or as new tech comes out.

452
00:28:37,806 --> 00:28:42,448
And it also helps develop emotional resilience. So if and when something goes wrong on your project,

453
00:28:42,448 --> 00:28:49,793
you'll know how to do it better next time. So you'll have other skills that will be useful

454
00:28:49,793 --> 00:28:54,735
in your journey through the industry. So make sure that you...

455
00:28:55,203 --> 00:29:01,565
keep space for that and find out what works for you. So I've only listed three here and this is

456
00:29:01,565 --> 00:29:09,688
not an exhaustive list. Okay, using a combination of my skills I started my journey into games at

457
00:29:09,688 --> 00:29:16,990
Xbox and after that I went to Bungie to work on Destiny 2 and its DLCs and then I moved to

458
00:29:16,990 --> 00:29:22,051
Herobrine Schemes for Battletech and its DLCs. So even within the industry,

459
00:29:22,763 --> 00:29:26,186
You'll be moving between studios and projects and roles,

460
00:29:26,186 --> 00:29:31,451
and it's important to keep those soft skills developed.

461
00:29:31,451 --> 00:29:35,674
In summary, prepare yourself for the games industry.

462
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:38,376
Do your research and take stock of your skills.

463
00:29:38,376 --> 00:29:41,379
And once you have your hard skills at the level

464
00:29:41,379 --> 00:29:44,621
that you need for the roles you're applying to,

465
00:29:44,621 --> 00:29:45,682
focus on your soft skills.

466
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,361
Regardless of what role you end up taking,

467
00:29:49,361 --> 00:29:50,682
or what studio you go to,

468
00:29:50,682 --> 00:29:52,322
or what project you're working on,

469
00:29:52,322 --> 00:29:55,064
you'll need your soft skills to work with other people.

470
00:29:55,064 --> 00:30:01,127
And finally, don't forget to keep developing your skills.

471
00:30:01,127 --> 00:30:04,249
One cool thing about the games industry

472
00:30:04,249 --> 00:30:06,130
is we are constantly evolving.

473
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:07,931
Our tools will continue to improve

474
00:30:07,931 --> 00:30:09,672
and our products will continue to improve.

475
00:30:09,672 --> 00:30:12,073
So remember to keep improving yourself as well.

476
00:30:12,947 --> 00:30:15,969
All right, so now we'll go into our Q&A session,

477
00:30:15,969 --> 00:30:18,352
where we have a couple of questions

478
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,674
that we'll talk about in the panel.

479
00:30:20,674 --> 00:30:23,997
So firstly, let's talk about skills.

480
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:25,579
So we've talked a lot about our skills

481
00:30:25,579 --> 00:30:29,823
and our previous experiences in our individual presentations.

482
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:33,366
So how did you all try to leverage your previous experience

483
00:30:33,366 --> 00:30:34,667
during your job search in games?

484
00:30:34,667 --> 00:30:35,188
I can go first.

485
00:30:37,917 --> 00:30:43,879
For that one, I did have a lot of smaller jobs, but the two main jobs or careers that I had before

486
00:30:43,879 --> 00:30:49,760
video games were freelance graphic and web design and shipping. And the type of skills I had from

487
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:54,721
both of those are very different. For freelance graphic and web design mostly, I actually had

488
00:30:54,721 --> 00:31:00,763
some hard skills that I was able to apply pretty much directly into game development. So I learned

489
00:31:00,763 --> 00:31:02,943
some scripting because you needed to do some scripting.

490
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:06,829
And even though it wasn't in the same languages that we were using in video games,

491
00:31:06,829 --> 00:31:12,198
just having some kind of a background and understanding how that works.

492
00:31:13,517 --> 00:31:18,722
allowed me to learn more proprietary editors and the scripting languages that went with them.

493
00:31:18,722 --> 00:31:22,626
And surprisingly, my Photoshop skills were actually really strong,

494
00:31:22,626 --> 00:31:28,071
because I was a graphic designer, right? And that was a thing I was able to leverage,

495
00:31:28,071 --> 00:31:31,614
but I think I had to actually scale back. Because game designers are not supposed to

496
00:31:31,614 --> 00:31:34,937
make their mock-ups look good and spend a lot of time on them. That's not the point.

497
00:31:35,818 --> 00:31:43,002
We're supposed to like just you know make fakes or like something that's quick and dirty just to give an impression or an idea.

498
00:31:43,002 --> 00:31:56,971
And one of the funny stories that happened actually is that one of the games I worked on shipped with a mock-up of an options menu that I made as a mock-up because I polished it a little too much and we put it as a placeholder into the game.

499
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:00,212
And nobody noticed, including myself, we forgot about it.

500
00:32:00,212 --> 00:32:02,733
And only much later did someone say, hey, you know,

501
00:32:02,733 --> 00:32:04,894
that looks a little bit different than the other menus,

502
00:32:04,894 --> 00:32:05,695
but it was too late.

503
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:06,875
The game released that much.

504
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,657
I won't tell you which game, because I still, you know,

505
00:32:09,657 --> 00:32:11,377
NDAs, I don't know when they expire

506
00:32:11,377 --> 00:32:14,119
when I'm allowed to talk about it.

507
00:32:14,119 --> 00:32:16,340
But yeah, however, those tools,

508
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:18,060
those editors that I learned,

509
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:21,422
a lot of those skills were able to be leveraged directly.

510
00:32:22,131 --> 00:32:27,034
In terms of my shipping industry experience, a lot of that was just dealing with people.

511
00:32:27,034 --> 00:32:30,796
And that I was able to leverage specifically into the interview.

512
00:32:30,796 --> 00:32:37,500
You know, just talking to people, negotiating, and those are skills.

513
00:32:37,500 --> 00:32:41,843
And what I tell a lot of people is that interviewing is a skill like any other.

514
00:32:41,843 --> 00:32:46,005
Even if you're happy with your current job, it doesn't hurt once in a while just to say yes

515
00:32:46,005 --> 00:32:49,107
to an interview. If there's just even a small chance that you might say yes to the job,

516
00:32:50,187 --> 00:32:52,048
because you'll get better.

517
00:32:52,048 --> 00:32:54,508
Like you'll start to understand what the expectations are.

518
00:32:54,508 --> 00:32:55,668
You'll start to see your worth,

519
00:32:55,668 --> 00:32:57,909
but you're actually gonna get better at interviewing.

520
00:32:57,909 --> 00:32:59,649
You'll start, a lot of the interviews,

521
00:32:59,649 --> 00:33:03,870
you hear the same questions and, you know,

522
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:05,710
you'll be able to see patterns of thought.

523
00:33:05,710 --> 00:33:08,511
So I had a head start in that

524
00:33:08,511 --> 00:33:13,672
because a lot of the skills I had was meeting new captains

525
00:33:13,672 --> 00:33:16,292
almost on a weekly basis from all over the world.

526
00:33:16,292 --> 00:33:17,693
So I had, like, I was very good

527
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:18,813
at making a good impression.

528
00:33:19,413 --> 00:33:21,634
and understanding where they're coming from and learning,

529
00:33:21,634 --> 00:33:23,176
you know, knowing what their values are

530
00:33:23,176 --> 00:33:24,617
and laughing at their jokes

531
00:33:24,617 --> 00:33:26,298
and all these little things that are subtle.

532
00:33:26,298 --> 00:33:27,078
I had a headstart.

533
00:33:27,078 --> 00:33:29,220
Like I had a lot of experience doing that.

534
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,260
That helped me in my career.

535
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:32,782
It translated well into freelance and graphic web design.

536
00:33:32,782 --> 00:33:34,303
I was able to meet clients

537
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:35,964
and relate with them really quickly.

538
00:33:35,964 --> 00:33:37,966
And it also helped me with my one interview

539
00:33:37,966 --> 00:33:40,888
that I had at the beginning of my career

540
00:33:40,888 --> 00:33:47,272
that I got lucky and I was able to land.

541
00:33:47,272 --> 00:33:47,412
Oh.

542
00:33:48,370 --> 00:33:56,116
Yeah, so more about skills. Were there any skills that you feel like you should have had

543
00:33:56,116 --> 00:34:03,682
but you didn't have when you moved into games? And if so, what would you suggest to people that

544
00:34:03,682 --> 00:34:08,947
are considering entering games with respect to developing those skills?

545
00:34:08,947 --> 00:34:14,331
I can go with that one. So I think that for me it was specifically

546
00:34:14,954 --> 00:34:19,816
that as I wanted, I had pretty clear that I wanted to be a game designer. Right now,

547
00:34:19,816 --> 00:34:24,017
I don't know if I want to be just a game designer and also a narrative designer. So like, as

548
00:34:24,017 --> 00:34:28,859
you can see, like, you don't need to choose one path at the beginning of your career and

549
00:34:28,859 --> 00:34:30,319
stick to that. You can

550
00:34:30,917 --> 00:34:38,401
do many things. But basically, I think that for me, it was that I was a bit lost with, you know,

551
00:34:38,401 --> 00:34:44,844
how to do things like in terms of like, okay, so people that was pretty technical, but I think I'm,

552
00:34:44,844 --> 00:34:49,927
I really don't enjoy making lots of spreadsheets and stuff. So I feel like I was not like a

553
00:34:49,927 --> 00:34:55,190
technical game designer, I felt that I wanted to be a game designer, but not a technical one.

554
00:34:55,190 --> 00:34:59,792
And I thought that maybe that's why it was not a place for me in the games industry.

555
00:35:00,365 --> 00:35:05,150
But then I realized that it's possible to find your voice in the games industry.

556
00:35:05,150 --> 00:35:07,612
Not everyone works in the same way.

557
00:35:07,612 --> 00:35:12,076
So that I was not less game designer because I didn't enjoy spreadsheets.

558
00:35:12,076 --> 00:35:18,463
But I could, you know, I sometimes do enjoy spreadsheets, but it's not my favorite thing.

559
00:35:18,463 --> 00:35:22,166
And I realized then that it's possible to to kind of work on your.

560
00:35:22,727 --> 00:35:28,009
own way and that to show others that you are efficient the same and that you do you can do

561
00:35:28,009 --> 00:35:32,690
different new things uh just working on your way because if all of us we work in the same way

562
00:35:32,690 --> 00:35:36,851
there is no innovation at all in the games industry and everything will look the same

563
00:35:36,851 --> 00:35:42,672
so it's actually like i think my recommendation is that follow your heart and try to work on

564
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:48,894
your own way with your own skills and contributing with your uniqueness because you probably there

565
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:52,375
is no one else in the world that works like you do so like

566
00:35:52,795 --> 00:35:58,838
you know, it's really good to kind of get inspired by other people in the games industry,

567
00:35:58,838 --> 00:36:03,540
you know, our colleagues every day and even our friends, but it's also important that you look at

568
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:09,403
what makes you unique because probably there are lots of things and I think that's also part of

569
00:36:09,403 --> 00:36:20,168
the kind of spiciness you can add to your career from your own self. Cool, yeah that's awesome.

570
00:36:20,168 --> 00:36:20,588
Okay, so

571
00:36:22,394 --> 00:36:24,816
We all have very different backgrounds into games.

572
00:36:24,816 --> 00:36:29,980
And I know sometimes, like we've mentioned,

573
00:36:29,980 --> 00:36:33,322
not having a games background to go into games

574
00:36:33,322 --> 00:36:35,644
has been this weird, vicious circle,

575
00:36:35,644 --> 00:36:39,067
but also is sometimes problematic

576
00:36:39,067 --> 00:36:43,510
if you have particular backgrounds that don't seem

577
00:36:43,510 --> 00:36:44,851
to obviously fit into games.

578
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:47,873
So for me, I know when I started applying

579
00:36:47,873 --> 00:36:48,974
to the games industry,

580
00:36:50,646 --> 00:36:54,968
And this was across a bunch of different roles, like in QA,

581
00:36:54,968 --> 00:36:57,489
or in marketing, or in production.

582
00:36:57,489 --> 00:36:59,849
I got rejected from a bunch of places

583
00:36:59,849 --> 00:37:02,551
just because I was told I was overqualified

584
00:37:02,551 --> 00:37:03,591
due to having a PhD.

585
00:37:03,591 --> 00:37:06,152
And that also made me a flight risk.

586
00:37:06,152 --> 00:37:08,753
So studios were concerned I wouldn't

587
00:37:08,753 --> 00:37:11,394
want to stay at that particular workplace.

588
00:37:11,394 --> 00:37:18,076
And I was just going home using them as a foot in the door.

589
00:37:18,076 --> 00:37:19,657
So I was wondering, do any of you

590
00:37:20,237 --> 00:37:24,823
your backgrounds being challenging for entering games or moving through games?

591
00:37:24,823 --> 00:37:35,316
Yeah, I can say something real fast about that. So when I entered the games industry

592
00:37:35,316 --> 00:37:37,739
at Riot Games, so I started in recruiting,

593
00:37:38,209 --> 00:37:44,331
And a big reason I was able to do that is that recruiting isn't one of those roles where people

594
00:37:44,331 --> 00:37:50,192
are like, oh, you need a computer science degree and things like that. But when I eventually wanted

595
00:37:50,192 --> 00:37:56,954
to transition from recruiting to production and leading teams, I got a lot of pushback.

596
00:37:56,954 --> 00:38:03,095
And I really, really had to lean on finding mentors and advocates for myself because

597
00:38:03,095 --> 00:38:07,817
there are some people who are like, they just didn't see how

598
00:38:08,107 --> 00:38:14,209
what I was doing could possibly apply to leading a team of game devs.

599
00:38:14,209 --> 00:38:17,850
And so, yeah, it just falls back to those.

600
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:21,952
You know, there are people who have a fixed mindset

601
00:38:21,952 --> 00:38:26,173
and they'll look at your background and completely judge you for that.

602
00:38:26,473 --> 00:38:32,221
But again, like Riot Games is also the same company where I found my mentors and I was able

603
00:38:32,221 --> 00:38:36,707
to transition into production. So they had both those people there, right? The fixed mindset

604
00:38:36,707 --> 00:38:41,213
people and the growth mindset people. But yeah, it has been held against me.

605
00:38:43,135 --> 00:38:46,276
I could add something to that as well.

606
00:38:46,276 --> 00:38:49,058
It's a little, I mean, it's not 100% answering your question,

607
00:38:49,058 --> 00:38:53,280
but it's still something I think is pertinent and related.

608
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:55,201
Working with people from all over the world

609
00:38:55,201 --> 00:38:58,322
as a shipping agent, basically, it

610
00:38:58,322 --> 00:38:59,923
helped me develop thick skin.

611
00:38:59,923 --> 00:39:02,364
Because people have different cultures and norms

612
00:39:02,364 --> 00:39:06,006
and backgrounds and values.

613
00:39:06,006 --> 00:39:07,787
And a lot of times, they'll say things

614
00:39:07,787 --> 00:39:10,868
that are somewhat inappropriate when your first name is Osama

615
00:39:10,868 --> 00:39:11,709
or you have that.

616
00:39:12,450 --> 00:39:14,310
an interesting background to them.

617
00:39:14,310 --> 00:39:17,432
This actually helped me develop thick skin.

618
00:39:17,432 --> 00:39:19,673
So at the beginning of the industry,

619
00:39:19,673 --> 00:39:22,734
the topic of microaggressions, which I didn't even

620
00:39:22,734 --> 00:39:25,735
know the word back then, was one where

621
00:39:25,735 --> 00:39:30,037
I was able to shrug off a lot of things directed at me.

622
00:39:30,037 --> 00:39:32,998
And that sounds like a good thing,

623
00:39:32,998 --> 00:39:34,078
but it's actually not a good thing.

624
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:41,872
To a certain extent, there are some things that shouldn't be tolerated in a workplace.

625
00:39:41,872 --> 00:39:53,317
And it took me a while before I understood that these skills that I had learned in the shipping industry were probably not a good thing and that I could have leveraged them differently.

626
00:39:54,163 --> 00:39:56,885
I should have been able to be more vocal and whatnot.

627
00:39:56,885 --> 00:39:59,086
So it probably saved me because at the beginning,

628
00:39:59,086 --> 00:39:59,906
when you're a junior,

629
00:39:59,906 --> 00:40:01,347
you probably should keep your head down

630
00:40:01,347 --> 00:40:02,728
because you don't have a lot of power

631
00:40:02,728 --> 00:40:06,310
or the agency to be able to do much.

632
00:40:06,620 --> 00:40:23,694
But it's also something that was complicated later because I had this unhealthy relationship with microaggressions that I had to unlearn and learn how to stand up for myself and my values later on.

633
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:30,781
So it's something to watch out for. You know, this diplomacy can go both ways.

634
00:40:30,781 --> 00:40:32,902
Well, we're glad you got through that.

635
00:40:32,902 --> 00:40:34,003
Thank you.

636
00:40:34,003 --> 00:40:34,364
Cool, so...

637
00:40:35,678 --> 00:40:41,180
Yeah, speaking of interacting with different types of people,

638
00:40:41,180 --> 00:40:46,081
we've also touched on networking and, you know, networking is a

639
00:40:46,081 --> 00:40:50,723
key skill that people develop in their job searches, especially

640
00:40:50,723 --> 00:40:55,284
in the games industry. So yeah, I was wondering if you could

641
00:40:55,284 --> 00:40:58,425
tell me something about like the role that networking and making

642
00:40:58,425 --> 00:41:02,446
contacts had for, you know, job searches.

643
00:41:02,446 --> 00:41:04,087
Yeah, so for me, like

644
00:41:04,716 --> 00:41:08,940
I 100% got into the industry through networking.

645
00:41:08,940 --> 00:41:11,262
And it wasn't on purpose or anything like that.

646
00:41:11,262 --> 00:41:14,425
It was just that I had done all of this volunteer work.

647
00:41:14,425 --> 00:41:18,648
And through doing that, people recognized my abilities

648
00:41:18,648 --> 00:41:21,130
to be organized, reliable, et cetera.

649
00:41:21,130 --> 00:41:28,077
And so I guess when you think about networking,

650
00:41:28,077 --> 00:41:30,178
it is less about.

651
00:41:31,369 --> 00:41:36,872
you know, rubbing shoulders and like just trying to make the right connections. It's really about

652
00:41:36,872 --> 00:41:42,616
trying to establish actual relationships with people because again, you want to be remembered.

653
00:41:42,616 --> 00:41:48,539
You never know when opportunities are going to pop up. I think that I had been volunteering for

654
00:41:48,539 --> 00:41:54,163
two years before an opportunity popped up. So, you know, if I had gone into it thinking,

655
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:59,286
oh, three months after I meet somebody, I'm going to have a job, I would have been very disappointed.

656
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,802
I can add to that as well.

657
00:42:04,802 --> 00:42:07,884
So my network in the gaming industry

658
00:42:07,884 --> 00:42:11,327
before getting into games was exactly four people.

659
00:42:11,327 --> 00:42:13,368
I knew four people who worked in games,

660
00:42:13,368 --> 00:42:17,051
all of which I met before in different contexts,

661
00:42:17,051 --> 00:42:19,533
before they were in video games.

662
00:42:19,533 --> 00:42:22,835
Like Ahmed, who I mentioned in my presentation,

663
00:42:22,835 --> 00:42:24,537
we played field hockey together.

664
00:42:24,537 --> 00:42:26,538
That's how we met the first time we played.

665
00:42:26,538 --> 00:42:28,059
He played on my team.

666
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:28,900
And.

667
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,861
I also 100% got into the game industry because of my network,

668
00:42:33,861 --> 00:42:35,442
because Ahmed helped me build a portfolio.

669
00:42:35,442 --> 00:42:38,703
And one of my friends, Alexi, who worked at Gameloft

670
00:42:38,703 --> 00:42:40,563
at the time, and that's where I had my first job

671
00:42:40,563 --> 00:42:42,444
in the industry, put in a good word for me.

672
00:42:42,444 --> 00:42:45,744
I don't know how far that went,

673
00:42:45,744 --> 00:42:48,325
but it's also the only place that gave me an interview.

674
00:42:48,325 --> 00:42:50,626
And it's the only place someone put in a good word for me.

675
00:42:50,626 --> 00:42:54,687
So I would like, I have very strong reasons to believe

676
00:42:54,687 --> 00:42:58,428
that it was because of his nudge that I got the interview.

677
00:42:58,908 --> 00:43:05,675
even though there's no direct proof for that. What I wanted to add is a good way to expand

678
00:43:05,675 --> 00:43:13,743
your network is to look for a mentor. And people often get this wrong. But oftentimes,

679
00:43:13,743 --> 00:43:17,787
when they look for a mentor, the instinct is to overshoot.

680
00:43:18,248 --> 00:43:22,750
they're going to look for someone who's already, for example, an art director, a creative director,

681
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:27,212
a game director. That's not a bad thing. I'm not saying don't do this, but what I'm saying is

682
00:43:27,212 --> 00:43:32,114
those people will generally have much less time for you, and their experience in terms of when

683
00:43:32,114 --> 00:43:37,837
they got into the industry is removed by several years. So it's not as fresh. I was lucky because

684
00:43:37,837 --> 00:43:41,599
Ahmed was my mentor, as I even used that word in my presentation.

685
00:43:41,859 --> 00:43:47,321
He had only been a designer for less than a year by the time that he showed me how to build a portfolio.

686
00:43:47,321 --> 00:43:53,564
But it was fresh in his mind. He knew what to what he had to do to go through and what was necessary.

687
00:43:53,564 --> 00:43:57,805
Plus nobody else was asking him to be a mentor so he had a lot of time to dedicate to me.

688
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:03,525
So a lot of times, I mean, shake it up, get different mentors from different places,

689
00:44:03,525 --> 00:44:08,409
but don't snub your nose at a junior who was just in the industry who might have a lot of

690
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:12,953
valuable information and will be able to help you. It'll probably be much easier for you to

691
00:44:12,953 --> 00:44:16,296
get a hold of them and that relationship will probably give you more.

692
00:44:17,982 --> 00:44:28,909
Yeah, I think I want to just like echo that and say that I've worked with some, you know, more senior level people and at some point they're so far removed from what you're going to be doing.

693
00:44:28,909 --> 00:44:39,977
Like, I probably wouldn't ask an executive producer how to do scrum because they've probably forgotten.

694
00:44:39,977 --> 00:44:46,261
Yeah, I'll also add, given the pace at which this industry changes.

695
00:44:46,650 --> 00:44:52,734
two, three years, like that's probably the range where like they will have seen like what the work

696
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:57,618
will be like, what the tools you'll be using will be like, and someone who's like I'm a 25-year

697
00:44:57,618 --> 00:45:03,082
veteran, like that's great if you can have contact with those people and learn from them, but like

698
00:45:03,082 --> 00:45:08,526
the tools have changed so much and the methods and the culture has changed so much in that time, so

699
00:45:08,526 --> 00:45:14,590
just I think it's really important to be aware of what the current targets are and also you know

700
00:45:14,590 --> 00:45:15,851
the trajectory that you're taking.

701
00:45:18,273 --> 00:45:19,614
Cool. All right.

702
00:45:19,614 --> 00:45:31,577
So one thing I also wanted to add to just the point about networking is for me, it was finding the correct insertion point.

703
00:45:31,577 --> 00:45:42,420
So I came into the industry in a very like through a very weird angle because I had academic knowledge of like, for example, the philosophy of race and gender, because I taught that.

704
00:45:43,009 --> 00:45:49,035
and that transferred into networking with a very particular intersection of people at between

705
00:45:49,035 --> 00:45:55,040
people that cared about diversity and inclusion stuff and games and then I went from that into

706
00:45:55,040 --> 00:46:01,807
D&I work in studios and that turned into founding the Bungie Diversity Committee and also founding

707
00:46:01,807 --> 00:46:05,850
what we now call the Jedi Council at Harebrained Schemes where Jedi stands for justice, equity,

708
00:46:05,850 --> 00:46:08,493
diversity and inclusion. So one thing...

709
00:46:09,078 --> 00:46:14,559
to take from that, I think, was even though I had these skills for getting networking

710
00:46:14,559 --> 00:46:19,920
into this particular angle, I could use that to amplify things I cared about once I got into the

711
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:26,121
industry and into a studio. And so networking isn't just here is a person, I'm using that

712
00:46:26,121 --> 00:46:31,262
person to get into, like, you know, get my foot in the door to get into the industry. But it's

713
00:46:31,262 --> 00:46:36,663
also about maintaining those contacts. And then once you get there, hold the door open for other

714
00:46:36,663 --> 00:46:36,983
people.

715
00:46:39,979 --> 00:46:49,526
Cool. Okay. Speaking more about networking, let's talk about LinkedIn, because I know developers love to use LinkedIn.

716
00:46:49,526 --> 00:46:58,753
And for me, when I entered the industry, I had to basically make a profile from scratch because academics don't use LinkedIn.

717
00:46:58,753 --> 00:46:59,454
We use this.

718
00:46:59,855 --> 00:47:06,340
thing that's called academia, because creative names, we basically make a profile and then

719
00:47:06,340 --> 00:47:10,743
instead of just all your workplaces, you list all the places that you've taught at and where

720
00:47:10,743 --> 00:47:17,308
you got your degrees and you publish your papers on this website. And so from going

721
00:47:17,308 --> 00:47:23,493
from academia into games, I had to make this whole profile from scratch because otherwise I had no

722
00:47:23,493 --> 00:47:26,175
online presence in any professional capacity.

723
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:30,217
And after I did that, people could find me and see what I did and what I cared about.

724
00:47:30,217 --> 00:47:36,701
So I was just wondering about the impact that networking online or LinkedIn had on your job

725
00:47:36,701 --> 00:47:39,062
searches.

726
00:47:39,062 --> 00:47:46,426
Yeah, for me, I didn't really use LinkedIn for networking at all, but I did.

727
00:47:46,426 --> 00:47:51,268
I was sort of like, you know, one of those early adopters of whenever a new platform

728
00:47:51,268 --> 00:47:51,849
would appear.

729
00:47:51,849 --> 00:47:54,410
And I was like, oh, LinkedIn.

730
00:47:54,410 --> 00:47:54,730
And.

731
00:47:55,183 --> 00:48:02,466
I put all of my volunteer experience on LinkedIn, because volunteer experience counts.

732
00:48:02,466 --> 00:48:08,488
So yeah, I put all of that on LinkedIn. And then I also had like, my one paid experience with the

733
00:48:08,488 --> 00:48:13,949
BlazBlue Chrono Phantasma in the industry. And before joining the games industry, I was a teacher,

734
00:48:13,949 --> 00:48:20,531
so I like had all of that on there too. But somebody from Riot Games ended up finding me

735
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:23,492
on LinkedIn initially. And so, you know, I

736
00:48:24,290 --> 00:48:31,594
you know, owe a lot to just having visibility and discovery, discoverability on that website

737
00:48:31,594 --> 00:48:35,936
because otherwise, I don't know, I may not be in the games industry. Maybe I'd be in

738
00:48:35,936 --> 00:48:42,560
the anime industry, who knows. But yeah, I like highly, highly recommend making yourself

739
00:48:42,560 --> 00:48:48,203
as discoverable as possible, because you never know who's looking for your skill sets.

740
00:48:50,810 --> 00:48:58,013
Speaking specifically to that, actually, the first poke that I had for an interview was for a poker

741
00:48:58,013 --> 00:49:04,516
expert. And apparently one of the things that made my portfolio or CV stand out was because I had

742
00:49:04,516 --> 00:49:10,759
poker written in the interests. I used to play poker with my friends. So yeah, don't be afraid

743
00:49:10,759 --> 00:49:15,061
to become a human and be a person and to show that side of you, like the interesting things,

744
00:49:15,061 --> 00:49:17,883
the different things about you, anything will help you stand out.

745
00:49:22,553 --> 00:49:24,214
Cool.

746
00:49:24,214 --> 00:49:27,958
Yeah, it's important, I think, just as we go through games,

747
00:49:27,958 --> 00:49:30,941
also, I know there's been this kind of cultural shift into

748
00:49:30,941 --> 00:49:33,623
seeing developers as human beings

749
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:35,565
with these multifaceted identities.

750
00:49:35,565 --> 00:49:37,867
And we do more than just make games.

751
00:49:37,867 --> 00:49:41,230
So yeah, I think that's really important just

752
00:49:41,230 --> 00:49:42,872
to show really who you are.

753
00:49:42,872 --> 00:49:47,316
Yeah, so let's talk a little bit about

754
00:49:48,148 --> 00:49:56,692
supplemental education. So I mentioned that I had done a really short computer science course

755
00:49:56,692 --> 00:50:05,477
and Marina, you went to school for games. So what kind of supplemental education or certifications

756
00:50:05,477 --> 00:50:09,139
do you think are useful or not useful for people who are trying to break into games?

757
00:50:09,139 --> 00:50:14,482
So basically, it's true that I have a master's degree in game design but

758
00:50:15,243 --> 00:50:22,065
Even though it was a good thing because like I don't know in my times like three years ago

759
00:50:22,065 --> 00:50:28,907
everyone was saying that if you didn't have a you know a certificate that said that you were

760
00:50:28,907 --> 00:50:34,288
a game designer no one was gonna hire you so I wasn't scared of that and that's how I thought I

761
00:50:34,288 --> 00:50:41,690
needed to apply to a master's degree but the thing is that when when I arrived to uni I had a head

762
00:50:42,385 --> 00:50:47,028
two years, almost two years of, you know, going to events in

763
00:50:47,028 --> 00:50:49,990
Spain, to games events, to networking with people, of

764
00:50:49,990 --> 00:50:54,273
networking with people, of making Bitsy games in my free

765
00:50:54,273 --> 00:51:00,037
time. So once like I arrived to the masters, I actually had much

766
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:03,179
more experience than what I thought. So they, you know,

767
00:51:03,179 --> 00:51:06,541
like everything was there was very useful to kind of refresh

768
00:51:06,541 --> 00:51:08,842
knowledge. And, you know, like even

769
00:51:09,329 --> 00:51:18,358
For example, getting skills on the production side or even pitch decks was a thing that we saw in the master's degree.

770
00:51:18,358 --> 00:51:26,246
But I don't think that it was something that helped me to discover new things.

771
00:51:26,246 --> 00:51:33,573
It just gave support to things that I already did my homework at home years before.

772
00:51:34,792 --> 00:51:41,956
And then I wanted to talk about another important thing is that I did a whole lot of

773
00:51:41,956 --> 00:51:46,879
courses that were from Coursera and those kind of things that are for free many times.

774
00:51:46,879 --> 00:51:53,363
And I did lots of them, like I did courses from CalArts, I did courses from Brown University,

775
00:51:53,363 --> 00:51:59,667
like many of them in many things, and especially in graphic design and, you know, those things,

776
00:51:59,667 --> 00:52:00,688
in game design as well.

777
00:52:01,448 --> 00:52:06,570
I got a very good course from CalArts in Coursera, actually, before going to uni.

778
00:52:06,570 --> 00:52:13,793
And I think that that's also very important because many times, as Erika said as well,

779
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:18,635
we don't count kind of experience that we have with things that are kind of for free,

780
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:22,976
but it's time you're taking into, you know, like time you're putting from

781
00:52:23,293 --> 00:52:28,116
aside to learn new things and that's important as well. The only difference between those things

782
00:52:28,116 --> 00:52:33,439
and going to school is that honestly that you pay and that you maybe have like a physical space

783
00:52:33,439 --> 00:52:38,242
where you do that. But I think one of the good things with the pandemic this year has been that

784
00:52:38,242 --> 00:52:39,023
we could see that.

785
00:52:39,636 --> 00:52:43,279
we can do lots of things and we don't need sometimes those spaces,

786
00:52:43,279 --> 00:52:47,943
even though, of course, being with other people with the same interests helps a whole lot.

787
00:52:47,943 --> 00:52:52,647
But also, like, I wanted to highlight the experience from disabled people that with

788
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:57,571
the pandemic, they were able to do much many more things than before.

789
00:52:57,571 --> 00:53:01,995
So we should really count these kind of things better in job experiences.

790
00:53:01,995 --> 00:53:07,860
So, yeah, any school, if you could go or if your parents can help you is fine.

791
00:53:08,414 --> 00:53:14,216
many countries is very difficult like in the US and other countries is very difficult for many

792
00:53:14,216 --> 00:53:21,458
people but I think it's not completely necessary today to get a you know an official thing so I

793
00:53:21,458 --> 00:53:27,260
would put more effort in things that we said already in this panel like networking like

794
00:53:27,260 --> 00:53:31,821
not only for you know get your your foot in the door but also to make friends.

795
00:53:32,493 --> 00:53:38,736
very good friends actually and you know like keep being curious and open. That's the best thing I

796
00:53:38,736 --> 00:53:43,938
think. Yeah from my point of view to answer the same question I agree with what Marina said

797
00:53:43,938 --> 00:53:52,040
wholeheartedly. I would say it also depends on the role that you have. Many of the companies

798
00:53:52,040 --> 00:53:57,462
that I worked in they didn't hire junior programmers unless they had a degree,

799
00:53:57,462 --> 00:54:01,924
programmers specifically. But designers it didn't really matter as long as they had a portfolio.

800
00:54:02,356 --> 00:54:07,678
and the most likely people to be hired as designers for people who are already in the company in

801
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:14,540
another role like for example QA or anything else because at that point a lot of things that

802
00:54:14,540 --> 00:54:18,341
designers have to know it's really hard to put in a portfolio it's really hard to show that you know

803
00:54:18,341 --> 00:54:21,942
how to do it so if you meet somebody and you work with them even in a different capacity you'll

804
00:54:21,942 --> 00:54:23,042
start to see if they have

805
00:54:23,262 --> 00:54:27,125
the soft skills or the analysis skills or analytical skills

806
00:54:27,125 --> 00:54:31,408
or anything else similar to that that they would need.

807
00:54:31,408 --> 00:54:34,230
So it's really hard to give an answer that just says,

808
00:54:34,230 --> 00:54:34,950
this is what you need.

809
00:54:34,950 --> 00:54:36,911
But from game designers specifically is,

810
00:54:36,911 --> 00:54:39,653
if you have some experience with an editor, any editor,

811
00:54:39,653 --> 00:54:41,855
because most of the companies or many of the companies

812
00:54:41,855 --> 00:54:44,036
use proprietary tools, so they won't expect you to know already

813
00:54:44,036 --> 00:54:46,638
what they're using, but you have some experience

814
00:54:46,638 --> 00:54:47,779
they feel that you could leverage.

815
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:53,563
game editors like Unreal or Unity either or, that's going to give you a plus. If you know

816
00:54:53,563 --> 00:54:57,826
how to use like Photoshop or something similar for mock-ups, if you know how to use Excel for

817
00:54:57,826 --> 00:55:03,930
formulas, and there's the one that I didn't know at all before getting into games, Visio for

818
00:55:03,930 --> 00:55:08,434
you know flowcharts and things like that. That's the thing that took me by complete surprise. I

819
00:55:08,434 --> 00:55:13,677
didn't know that existed. I used to make my ugly flowcharts in Photoshop myself and it's not very

820
00:55:13,677 --> 00:55:14,438
easy to do.

821
00:55:15,027 --> 00:55:20,212
I didn't know that, of course, it makes sense now, but you know, you don't know what you don't know.

822
00:55:20,212 --> 00:55:25,897
Once I learned about how to, I used one, a free one called YEd a million years ago,

823
00:55:25,897 --> 00:55:29,940
which I would recommend if it's still around because it's free. It's not, it's not like Visio,

824
00:55:29,940 --> 00:55:33,623
but there's a lot of other tools like that because a lot of things are really hard to

825
00:55:33,623 --> 00:55:39,048
show unless you show them in relation to other things. So it's a very graphic way to show your

826
00:55:39,048 --> 00:55:39,328
designs.

827
00:55:39,769 --> 00:55:46,330
So if you're in a different role, it's a good idea to get that mentor in that role and ask them

828
00:55:46,330 --> 00:55:51,291
what tools that they're using and find something equivalent where you get the same experience as

829
00:55:51,291 --> 00:56:00,573
well. Yeah, as like a producer or a project manager, again, like it's really hard to show

830
00:56:00,573 --> 00:56:07,654
your work and like show off a portfolio. And so when you have certifications in Scrum or PMP or

831
00:56:07,654 --> 00:56:08,694
whatever it is.

832
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:19,412
You know, it's just one of those things where it's to give people some level of confidence that you know how to do what you're doing and you've been educated on this kind of thing.

833
00:56:19,412 --> 00:56:32,363
I don't personally see value in the certifications like I have several agile certifications and a lot of times I'm sitting in those classes I'm like, yes, obviously talk to people and then you'll figure out the work system.

834
00:56:32,363 --> 00:56:35,866
But, you know,

835
00:56:36,447 --> 00:56:40,829
It's just one of those things that I feel like it's a good resume point, but

836
00:56:40,829 --> 00:56:44,412
practically, they're not necessarily super helpful.

837
00:56:44,412 --> 00:56:47,033
And so it also, unfortunately,

838
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:50,775
disadvantages people who can't afford to get those certifications.

839
00:56:50,775 --> 00:56:54,998
So the agile Illuminati is gonna be mad at me, but I think that a lot of these

840
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:58,860
classes are a waste of money or they overcharge.

841
00:56:59,379 --> 00:57:14,048
But yeah, it's just, you know, if you can get those additional bullet points on your resume when you're trying to break into the industry, it's just, you know, going to make it easier for you because when you think about applying for jobs, you

842
00:57:14,493 --> 00:57:18,735
think about it as like, how risky am I as a hire?

843
00:57:18,735 --> 00:57:21,476
And so that's sort of the assessment that interviewers

844
00:57:21,476 --> 00:57:23,677
and hiring managers are trying to make.

845
00:57:23,677 --> 00:57:25,578
Like, can I trust that this person can do the job?

846
00:57:25,578 --> 00:57:28,700
And so just like every little thing you can get

847
00:57:28,700 --> 00:57:33,842
to make you look like less risky of a hire is a benefit.

848
00:57:34,718 --> 00:57:40,220
Yeah, well if I could take it back to add one last quick thing. If your heart is set on studying game

849
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:45,361
design in university, that's fine, no problems with that. Just the most important metric with

850
00:57:45,361 --> 00:57:50,963
that is ask them about their placement rates. A lot more designers graduate per year than there

851
00:57:50,963 --> 00:57:55,764
are junior positions that open up, and the schools that are most successful, they're the ones who

852
00:57:55,764 --> 00:57:59,766
find the jobs, and that's ultimately what you want to do at the end. If they don't share their

853
00:57:59,766 --> 00:58:02,927
placement rates, that's a bad sign. So just putting it there.

854
00:58:04,827 --> 00:58:11,709
One thing I think I would also add to certification issues is I agree with Erica in terms of,

855
00:58:11,709 --> 00:58:17,291
at least from production, Scrum certification is highly, highly contested.

856
00:58:17,291 --> 00:58:20,832
And I know people like some courses are up to like $2,000.

857
00:58:20,832 --> 00:58:24,813
And if you're new in the industry and you don't know what you really want to do,

858
00:58:24,813 --> 00:58:26,353
that's a lot of money to drop in.

859
00:58:27,173 --> 00:58:28,694
you know, exploring a particular path.

860
00:58:28,694 --> 00:58:31,636
So if you do want a certification,

861
00:58:31,636 --> 00:58:34,957
there are cheaper alternatives you can look for.

862
00:58:34,957 --> 00:58:37,478
So Marina has suggested Coursera,

863
00:58:37,478 --> 00:58:39,619
and I actually did a Coursera program

864
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,460
just in project management,

865
00:58:41,460 --> 00:58:43,161
which was half the price

866
00:58:43,161 --> 00:58:45,322
and still gave me that one line on my resume.

867
00:58:45,322 --> 00:58:47,843
So that's also fine.

868
00:58:47,843 --> 00:58:51,225
One other thing is it does demonstrate motivation

869
00:58:51,225 --> 00:58:52,065
for self-starting,

870
00:58:52,065 --> 00:58:55,387
which is a soft skill that people care about.

871
00:58:55,387 --> 00:58:55,987
Cool.

872
00:58:56,886 --> 00:59:01,790
Okay, we have a little bit of time left, so very quickly,

873
00:59:01,790 --> 00:59:10,958
one sentence, what advice would you give other people regarding moving into games?

874
00:59:10,958 --> 00:59:17,563
Be good to people. People will remember it if you're good to people.

875
00:59:17,563 --> 00:59:23,068
I would say try to model the behaviors that you want other people to also do.

876
00:59:26,354 --> 00:59:29,756
I would say, like, again, take care of yourself and rest.

877
00:59:29,756 --> 00:59:34,420
And that's all we have time for.

878
00:59:34,420 --> 00:59:38,202
So thank you to our panelists, Erica, Osama and Marina.

879
00:59:38,202 --> 00:59:41,285
And thank you for coming and listening to our panel.

880
00:59:41,285 --> 00:59:45,608
So here we have our handles on Twitter if you would like to follow us and continue the

881
00:59:45,608 --> 00:59:46,068
conversation.

882
00:59:46,068 --> 00:59:46,709
So thank you.

883
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,009
Have a nice day.

884
00:59:48,009 --> 00:59:48,150
Bye.

885
