00:00:00,429 --> 00:00:05,110
On GDC Podcast episode 16, we have Greg Kasavin, creative director at Hades

2
00:00:05,110 --> 00:00:09,511
Developers Supergiant Games. We'll talk narrative design, his journey from game

3
00:00:09,511 --> 00:00:13,212
journalist to game developer, and the allure of the roguelike genre. Back in a sec.

4
00:00:13,212 --> 00:00:14,032
Welcome to the house of Hades!

5
00:00:40,858 --> 00:00:45,541
And we're back. This is Chris Graft. Is this how we do this?

6
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,242
Maybe. I don't know. It's been so long.

7
00:00:47,242 --> 00:00:51,264
Yeah, it has been a while. We're just going to use this take, too. I'm Chris Graft,

8
00:00:51,264 --> 00:00:54,926
editor-in-chief of Gamasutra. And hey, Alyssa.

9
00:00:54,926 --> 00:00:59,489
Hey, I'm Alyssa. I'm Alyssa Macklin, news editor, associate publisher at Gamasutra,

10
00:00:59,489 --> 00:01:00,850
expert podcaster.

11
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,991
Yeah, we haven't done the intro in a while.

12
00:01:02,991 --> 00:01:08,434
And if you're a regular listener, you will know that after 15 or 16 episodes,

13
00:01:08,434 --> 00:01:12,157
we have still not got the intros down quite perfectly.

14
00:01:12,157 --> 00:01:16,119
I'm afraid to listen to our first one because I feel like this is way better than we started.

15
00:01:16,119 --> 00:01:18,420
But I will never know because I'll never listen to it.

16
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:20,502
I think the first one, we just didn't do an intro.

17
00:01:20,502 --> 00:01:24,164
We just had the guests start like mid-sentence.

18
00:01:24,164 --> 00:01:26,926
And then we just sat and listened to them.

19
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:27,146
Bold.

20
00:01:27,486 --> 00:01:29,008
Yeah, yeah, we are bold.

21
00:01:29,008 --> 00:01:33,554
Um, so what have you been up to for the past?

22
00:01:33,554 --> 00:01:35,176
Oh, I don't even, I shouldn't ask.

23
00:01:35,176 --> 00:01:38,299
Yeah, it's all how was your last month?

24
00:01:38,299 --> 00:01:38,980
So that's okay.

25
00:01:38,980 --> 00:01:39,721
Good.

26
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,083
Same answer for that period of time.

27
00:01:41,083 --> 00:01:41,543
All right.

28
00:01:41,543 --> 00:01:45,588
Let's just, yeah, D&D hit man, rest of the world having a normal one.

29
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:52,854
Yeah, so I'm excited about the guest we have coming on today, but I think that maybe we

30
00:01:52,854 --> 00:02:00,158
should talk about some GDC stuff really quick, since this is technically the GDC podcast.

31
00:02:00,158 --> 00:02:05,742
Exciting guest, exciting new GDC content for this interesting period of time we have right

32
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:05,842
here.

33
00:02:05,842 --> 00:02:13,287
Oh, registration is now open for the GDC Masterclass Spring Sessions.

34
00:02:14,474 --> 00:02:22,764
So we had GDC Masterclass fall sessions and they went so swimmingly.

35
00:02:22,764 --> 00:02:25,407
We're going back to school in the spring.

36
00:02:25,407 --> 00:02:25,847
What do you think?

37
00:02:25,847 --> 00:02:26,448
What do you think of that?

38
00:02:26,448 --> 00:02:29,372
I was going to make a too cool for school joke, but I'm like, no, that's lame.

39
00:02:29,372 --> 00:02:29,812
And then I just.

40
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,983
No, it's all good. You should all go check it out. We have some people returning to

41
00:02:32,983 --> 00:02:34,144
There's actually one now where you can get certified in

42
00:02:34,144 --> 00:02:35,125
Agile, so that's that's

43
00:02:35,125 --> 00:02:35,905
obviously production and

44
00:02:35,905 --> 00:02:38,068
We have some for level design now and writing already getting some signups

45
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:38,588
So that is exciting

46
00:02:53,803 --> 00:02:57,844
Yeah, the benefit here is versus just watching a presentation, you actually get hands-on

47
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:02,466
time with the instructor in a call where you can get feedback, have conversations, ask

48
00:03:02,466 --> 00:03:05,227
questions and just get like really engaged knowledge.

49
00:03:05,227 --> 00:03:07,568
So it's a pretty cool offering, I think.

50
00:03:07,775 --> 00:03:09,716
Yeah, they're actual classes.

51
00:03:09,716 --> 00:03:13,156
You go to school, you grab your trapper keeper and you sit down.

52
00:03:13,156 --> 00:03:15,997
But yeah, but yeah, they really are courses.

53
00:03:15,997 --> 00:03:17,797
They're like, all day, all day courses that you take.

54
00:03:17,797 --> 00:03:19,197
So it's, it's quite more in depth than sitting in on a, you

55
00:03:19,197 --> 00:03:20,077
know, one hour long GDC session.

56
00:03:20,077 --> 00:03:22,358
So you can check that out at gdconf.com.

57
00:03:22,358 --> 00:03:22,418
And.

58
00:03:36,441 --> 00:03:41,579
Also, if one-hour GDC sessions are your thing, there's also GDC Showcase coming up.

59
00:03:42,214 --> 00:03:43,775
Yeah, oh, that was a good one.

60
00:03:43,775 --> 00:03:45,497
But most of those are 30 minutes long.

61
00:03:45,497 --> 00:03:47,178
Yep, I realized that as I said it, but you know what?

62
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:49,520
But if you watch two of them back to back,

63
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,222
it's an hour long.

64
00:03:51,222 --> 00:03:54,484
But that's a free thing that you can find out about.

65
00:03:54,484 --> 00:03:57,487
It's kind of acting like a preview

66
00:03:57,487 --> 00:04:00,830
to the content that we'll have at the big regular GDC

67
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:02,651
that is a fluid situation there.

68
00:04:07,975 --> 00:04:12,998
obviously, but yeah, you can go to GDC showcase. It's going to be free to

69
00:04:12,998 --> 00:04:17,040
register for. You get on the platform and we're going to have some a mix of brand

70
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,381
new talks. GDC podcast live is going to be there every day. There's going to be

71
00:04:20,381 --> 00:04:22,762
old talks with like, I don't say old talks, it's like a new game plus must talk.

72
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:24,743
Yeah, I've been thinking about it.

73
00:04:32,947 --> 00:04:39,349
Yeah, new session plus where you have a classic GDC session,

74
00:04:39,349 --> 00:04:41,810
one of the more memorable ones.

75
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:47,172
And the original speaker is going to be in the chat room

76
00:04:47,172 --> 00:04:50,253
talking while their past self is talking.

77
00:04:50,253 --> 00:04:52,454
So there's gonna be somebody in that box

78
00:04:52,454 --> 00:04:55,655
that attendees will be able to interact with.

79
00:04:55,655 --> 00:04:57,816
They can ask more questions, you know,

80
00:04:57,816 --> 00:04:59,276
about whatever topic is at hand.

81
00:04:59,817 --> 00:05:02,199
So there's gonna be all kinds of new things

82
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:04,801
for an entire week.

83
00:05:04,801 --> 00:05:06,363
So we're gonna be busy there.

84
00:05:06,363 --> 00:05:07,323
That is coming up.

85
00:05:07,323 --> 00:05:08,805
Yeah.

86
00:05:08,805 --> 00:05:11,407
March 15th through 19th, right?

87
00:05:11,407 --> 00:05:12,088
You nailed it.

88
00:05:12,088 --> 00:05:12,868
Nailed it.

89
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:13,969
That is absolutely what it is.

90
00:05:13,969 --> 00:05:14,870
And you can find out more at gdconf.com.

91
00:05:20,369 --> 00:05:21,910
Yeah, I think it's guest o'clock.

92
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:23,991
Yeah, it's guest o'clock.

93
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:29,835
Our next guest was an accomplished game journalist before making the move into game development.

94
00:05:29,835 --> 00:05:37,800
He is creative director at Supergiant Games, which developed the beloved instant classic

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:39,441
Hades.

96
00:05:39,441 --> 00:05:43,423
But you probably know him best as a writer at Newtype Gaming Magazine in the 90s.

97
00:05:43,423 --> 00:05:47,126
Let's welcome Greg Kasavin.

98
00:05:47,706 --> 00:05:55,228
Hey Greg! Hello! Hey, thanks for having me on the show. Yeah, of course, it's so nice to have you.

99
00:05:55,228 --> 00:06:02,330
So, I think we should get right into it because I've been doing game journalism. I'm going to

100
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:03,371
advertise how old I am.

101
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:10,797
full time since 2005, but I was reading you years before that.

102
00:06:10,797 --> 00:06:12,899
Can you talk a little bit?

103
00:06:12,899 --> 00:06:19,945
I want to get an idea of your journey from being a game journalist and a critic to a

104
00:06:19,945 --> 00:06:24,189
game developer, a creative director at one of the best game studios out there.

105
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:33,518
Thanks so much. It's wild to look back. The time flies, as I'm sure you can attest.

106
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:40,205
But yeah, I was really fortunate to get to start writing about games basically fresh out of high school.

107
00:06:40,205 --> 00:06:47,252
The sort of greater backstory to that is I've just been playing games all my life, since my earliest memory.

108
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:55,062
always captivated me. I don't know what I was doing in like, arcades as like a six year old or whatever in the...

109
00:06:55,062 --> 00:07:00,272
Uh, geez, it was, you know, would have been the late 80s at that point.

110
00:07:01,187 --> 00:07:06,148
But I was playing arcade games, I was playing computer games, I was playing console games,

111
00:07:06,148 --> 00:07:11,890
playing western games, playing Japanese games, just, I gobbled all of it up.

112
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:17,671
And I knew from, I say since I was about 8, that I wanted to make games.

113
00:07:17,671 --> 00:07:23,553
I was playing a game called Ultima 4, which is like the granddaddy of, you know, open

114
00:07:23,553 --> 00:07:23,873
world.

115
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:31,723
role-playing games. I think games like Skyrim owe a lot to the classic Ultima series.

116
00:07:31,723 --> 00:07:35,525
But I was playing this game as an eight-year-old and it was blowing my mind. You could just go

117
00:07:35,525 --> 00:07:42,009
anywhere, do anything, experience the consequences of your actions, and I had no idea how people

118
00:07:42,009 --> 00:07:45,831
made it, but I knew I wanted to do stuff like it.

119
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:50,414
But when I tried to teach myself programming on and off, including during high school,

120
00:07:50,414 --> 00:07:54,559
I just kind of bashed my head against it and it didn't go that well for me.

121
00:07:54,559 --> 00:07:55,600
But I always loved writing.

122
00:07:57,476 --> 00:08:03,662
um, as kind of the thing I liked, you know, academically besides going home and playing

123
00:08:03,662 --> 00:08:11,649
video games after school. And so in high school I was playing so many games that at a certain

124
00:08:11,649 --> 00:08:16,573
point I just like started to feel like almost guilty that I just kind of, I felt like I had

125
00:08:16,573 --> 00:08:19,076
to do something productive with it to like be able to justify...

126
00:08:20,037 --> 00:08:26,362
i still feel like everybody feels like that yeah yeah it wasn't even like i don't know that

127
00:08:26,362 --> 00:08:33,527
you know monetize my hobbies it was necessarily the the if that wasn't like i think just

128
00:08:33,527 --> 00:08:37,510
you know i i was yeah playing a bunch of games reading you know

129
00:08:38,214 --> 00:08:44,104
Electronic gaming monthly and all kinds of like magazines that were around at the time and I'm like I could I could you know

130
00:08:44,104 --> 00:08:50,734
I want to review video games and at the time, you know, I was already on the the internet such as it was and

131
00:08:50,734 --> 00:08:52,517
in there were like

132
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:56,868
you know little groups of folks interested in games and

133
00:08:56,868 --> 00:09:00,370
I met a friend across the country

134
00:09:00,370 --> 00:09:03,451
and we started making a little like fanzine together

135
00:09:03,451 --> 00:09:07,513
about video games and this is like this feels really prehistoric because it was

136
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:08,973
like literally you know printed

137
00:09:09,713 --> 00:09:12,074
on paper and then mailed to people.

138
00:09:12,074 --> 00:09:13,455
That rules.

139
00:09:13,455 --> 00:09:16,075
Yeah, so that's like how I got my, you know,

140
00:09:16,075 --> 00:09:20,817
reviewing like whatever Samurai Shodown 2 for a fanzine and that sort of thing.

141
00:09:20,817 --> 00:09:28,419
But it was enough to then, you know, there was a, you mentioned Newtype Gaming

142
00:09:28,419 --> 00:09:34,481
magazine. It was like a small local magazine in San Francisco and it was like kind of a

143
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:38,362
happenstance thing that I saw that they were like looking for writers and I'm like, hey,

144
00:09:38,362 --> 00:09:39,042
I've written stuff.

145
00:09:39,522 --> 00:09:42,605
you know i could i could do this or whatever uh... and and to my surprise

146
00:09:42,605 --> 00:09:44,947
uh... they they got back to me uh... and uh...

147
00:09:44,947 --> 00:09:45,267
you know that

148
00:09:45,267 --> 00:09:45,888
at this point

149
00:09:45,888 --> 00:09:48,470
i think i a m i'd like just

150
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:51,913
finished high school basically almost to the day

151
00:09:51,913 --> 00:09:52,654
uh... and and uh... i got to

152
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:07,976
I got to start writing a bit for Newtype, but they at the moment were already winding

153
00:10:07,976 --> 00:10:11,757
down from being a print publication and transforming themselves into a website.

154
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:15,399
They were kind of doing this a little bit before it was cool.

155
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:15,879
This is like 1995-ish.

156
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:16,940
And anyway...

157
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:30,476
One thing led to another. Myself and a couple of colleagues from Newtype, we started our own gaming website for a bit that we ran for about a year.

158
00:10:30,476 --> 00:10:32,177
What was that one called again?

159
00:10:32,177 --> 00:10:33,658
That was called Arcadia Magazine.

160
00:10:33,658 --> 00:10:41,462
We reviewed, we covered both pop culture stuff and games because we were into whatever.

161
00:10:41,462 --> 00:10:47,126
We were watching, I don't know that kung fu movies or whatever exactly qualify as pop culture actually.

162
00:10:47,126 --> 00:10:48,387
But it was just a weird mix of...

163
00:10:49,147 --> 00:10:54,348
of stuff like that. And then this is again, this is a stroke of fortune. I attribute a

164
00:10:54,348 --> 00:10:59,310
lot of things to luck. And I was living in San Francisco and I found out that there's

165
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,531
going to be a new gaming website that's launching. It's called GameSpot. And it's like funded.

166
00:11:04,531 --> 00:11:09,732
They like actually have money. And they actually have a staff. And they're serious about this

167
00:11:09,732 --> 00:11:15,433
whole gaming website thing. Unlike us, you know, little kind of hobbyist thing that we'd

168
00:11:15,433 --> 00:11:15,953
started. And I, you know...

169
00:11:19,895 --> 00:11:23,738
I sent them an email sounding more important than I actually was.

170
00:11:23,738 --> 00:11:26,761
Did you lie on your resume, Greg?

171
00:11:26,761 --> 00:11:29,163
No, it was just a thing that like if you...

172
00:11:29,163 --> 00:11:30,864
No one knows your age when you send an email.

173
00:11:30,864 --> 00:11:33,207
So if you send an email with like punctuation,

174
00:11:33,207 --> 00:11:35,489
people just assume that you can't be a teenager.

175
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:36,990
This guy is onto something.

176
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:42,355
Yeah. So they agreed to meet with me or whatever and they're like, you know...

177
00:11:43,095 --> 00:11:48,757
on no real basis, but eventually they're like, you know, we have an internship open or whatever, right?

178
00:11:48,757 --> 00:11:51,317
They weren't interested in like acquiring

179
00:11:51,317 --> 00:11:58,860
Arcadia magazine or nothing, but but um, but I'm like dude internship like it was a paid internship and everything. So

180
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:02,661
That was yeah. So this is in

181
00:12:02,661 --> 00:12:06,182
1996 in the fall and that's when I started as an intern

182
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,964
at GameSpot shortly after they had launched.

183
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:13,387
And that's when I first met folks like Jeff Gerstmann,

184
00:12:13,387 --> 00:12:18,010
who's still in the game after all these years,

185
00:12:18,010 --> 00:12:21,292
you know, at Giant Bomb,

186
00:12:21,292 --> 00:12:23,173
and other folks who I

187
00:12:23,173 --> 00:12:26,635
remember very fondly. So, yeah,

188
00:12:26,635 --> 00:12:27,136
I started...

189
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,342
uh... writing about games there uh... it was kind of my first real job

190
00:12:32,342 --> 00:12:36,083
and you got all the way up to executive editor at gamespot

191
00:12:36,083 --> 00:12:40,844
uh... yeah editor-in-chief yeah uh... uh... so yeah

192
00:12:40,844 --> 00:12:41,365
hi dogs

193
00:12:41,365 --> 00:12:41,865
yes

194
00:12:41,865 --> 00:12:44,726
wait for them

195
00:12:44,726 --> 00:12:46,006
yeah they're in the podcasting room

196
00:12:46,006 --> 00:12:46,226
uh... yeah

197
00:12:46,226 --> 00:12:46,446
yeah i

198
00:12:51,429 --> 00:12:58,505
I ended up working at GameSpot for more than 10 years, starting as an intern and ending up as editor-in-chief.

199
00:13:00,326 --> 00:13:07,692
And it was one of those things where I had completely fallen in love with that work of being a game critic.

200
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:13,016
Reviewing games was still always one of my favorite parts of the job,

201
00:13:13,016 --> 00:13:20,542
and toward the end there were pressures on me to spend my time on quote-unquote more important things,

202
00:13:20,542 --> 00:13:22,303
because I was responsible for...

203
00:13:23,864 --> 00:13:30,051
big aspects of the site, managing an editorial team, and those are in fact more important things.

204
00:13:30,051 --> 00:13:31,752
But I felt that...

205
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:39,083
you know, like reviewing games is at the heart of why I loved that work.

206
00:13:39,083 --> 00:13:42,605
But the years just flew by, right? And suddenly I'm in my late 20s and no

207
00:13:42,605 --> 00:13:45,226
closer to being a game developer and I'm like,

208
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:50,208
okay, well I could blink. Also, like, reviewing games is, that's

209
00:13:50,208 --> 00:13:53,509
like, that's hard work. Not hard work like

210
00:13:53,509 --> 00:13:58,192
working at a coal mine, but that's some time-intensive,

211
00:13:58,192 --> 00:13:59,372
tiring stuff.

212
00:13:59,789 --> 00:14:07,262
Yeah, I did it, I mean, I would do it mostly, I would, it was kind of my second job there, as it were, of like, I would do that as homework.

213
00:14:07,262 --> 00:14:11,349
Um, um, but, but it, again, it was like the part that I...

214
00:14:12,628 --> 00:14:18,936
I loved it, you know, reviewing games was an opportunity as always to just like, it

215
00:14:18,936 --> 00:14:26,565
gave me an excuse to play a lot of different games, and to just sort of understand my own

216
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:30,830
feelings about them, because I figured if I could...

217
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:35,842
You know, I think we all intuitively have a sense of what we like and what we don't.

218
00:14:35,842 --> 00:14:39,004
You know, you watch a movie and it's like, that was a bad movie or that was a good movie.

219
00:14:39,004 --> 00:14:40,305
But why, right?

220
00:14:40,305 --> 00:14:45,128
I like to ask myself why I felt a certain way about a certain game.

221
00:14:45,128 --> 00:14:49,551
What were the aspects of it that contributed to me thinking that it was so good

222
00:14:49,551 --> 00:14:52,493
or that it was, you know, not so good and so on.

223
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,494
And being a game critic, like...

224
00:14:55,334 --> 00:14:59,436
forced me to just be more introspective in that way and try to articulate it.

225
00:14:59,436 --> 00:15:04,099
And I hoped that maybe that experience would help make me...

226
00:15:04,872 --> 00:15:07,975
you know, a better game developer if I ever got the chance to do it.

227
00:15:07,975 --> 00:15:11,477
But yeah, and so I finally got my chance at the beginning of 2007

228
00:15:11,477 --> 00:15:16,601
when I went to go work at Electronic Arts in Los Angeles,

229
00:15:16,601 --> 00:15:17,742
as I heard they were...

230
00:15:17,742 --> 00:15:21,705
I forgot that you did that. I was, when I was doing my internet stocking...

231
00:15:21,705 --> 00:15:26,088
Oh yeah, you went to EALA, worked on Command & Conquer.

232
00:15:26,088 --> 00:15:30,171
Yeah. So that was one of those things, you know, again it was pretty...

233
00:15:31,482 --> 00:15:35,943
The opportunity was happenstance in that even after all that time at GameSpot, I didn't really

234
00:15:35,943 --> 00:15:45,087
know anybody in the industry because we were very strict about maintaining an editorial

235
00:15:45,087 --> 00:15:51,070
separation. If I'm reviewing games from different studios, I have to not have personal connections

236
00:15:51,070 --> 00:15:57,012
with those studios. So then I'm like, well, I'm no closer to becoming a game developer and I might

237
00:15:57,674 --> 00:16:00,115
I knew I would regret it if I never had a shot.

238
00:16:00,115 --> 00:16:06,978
And then, you know, a former GameSpot colleague who had gone to work at EALA before me, Amir

239
00:16:06,978 --> 00:16:13,541
Ajami, who's a dear friend of mine still, he always knew I was interested in development

240
00:16:13,541 --> 00:16:17,523
and he's like, yo, we have an opening for a producer if this is something you'd be interested

241
00:16:17,523 --> 00:16:18,424
in applying for.

242
00:16:18,424 --> 00:16:19,884
And I applied and I got it.

243
00:16:21,637 --> 00:16:28,981
Yeah, then that's when my development journey started, and it's certainly been a rollercoaster.

244
00:16:28,981 --> 00:16:35,905
At EA, I think on the very first day is where I met another Amir, Amir Rao, and Gavin Simon,

245
00:16:35,905 --> 00:16:42,269
who became friends of mine and later founded Supergiant Games, where I'm working now.

246
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,451
So there's a direct line.

247
00:16:45,311 --> 00:16:48,674
from my EA experience to what I've been doing ever since.

248
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:53,058
But yeah, at some point I, you know, the 10 years felt like a long time, but I've

249
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:57,843
now been in game development for longer than I was in the gaming press,

250
00:16:57,843 --> 00:17:00,225
you know, doing the math since 2007.

251
00:17:00,225 --> 00:17:04,389
But it feels like it does not feel like that long ago.

252
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:11,103
When you first made that jump, did you feel like- you talked about how you thought that your

253
00:17:11,103 --> 00:17:14,946
review experience would give you this kind of unique perspective going into games development.

254
00:17:14,946 --> 00:17:19,390
Did that actually happen that way? Did all your time spent in game journalism give you

255
00:17:19,390 --> 00:17:23,353
kind of a different outlook on how games are made once you got inside of the process?

256
00:17:23,353 --> 00:17:30,078
Yeah, you know what helped? I think the thing that helped me the most directly

257
00:17:30,078 --> 00:17:33,041
was the part where I had been working

258
00:17:34,442 --> 00:17:39,645
on a big website at a fairly high level in the organization.

259
00:17:39,645 --> 00:17:43,508
And a website is a bunch of software when you get right down to it,

260
00:17:43,508 --> 00:17:48,752
and it's software with artwork, with design,

261
00:17:48,752 --> 00:17:53,676
and basically we had departments at GameSpot that were...

262
00:17:56,258 --> 00:17:59,140
that basically have counterparts at a game development studio.

263
00:17:59,140 --> 00:18:03,864
So I had already... I felt like I already had some of the vocabulary

264
00:18:03,864 --> 00:18:07,627
to just like interact with, you know,

265
00:18:07,627 --> 00:18:12,332
with art teams, with engineers,

266
00:18:12,332 --> 00:18:16,195
and with marketing teams and stuff like that as well.

267
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:16,755
So that...

268
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:24,905
probably helped me at least as much as just my knowledge of games, however much I had.

269
00:18:24,905 --> 00:18:31,829
But I do think my knowledge around, like, my ability to have justified playing more games

270
00:18:31,829 --> 00:18:36,672
than average up to that point just has always given me like a broad...

271
00:18:36,672 --> 00:18:44,797
It makes me able to think of references to things quickly, if nothing else. So when

272
00:18:44,797 --> 00:18:46,278
tackling, like, a design problem.

273
00:18:47,237 --> 00:18:52,059
maybe I can think of a game that, you know, handled something in a similar way,

274
00:18:52,059 --> 00:18:56,040
like a reference to look at or something like that. And that's, that is, I do find that very

275
00:18:56,040 --> 00:19:02,622
helpful. If nothing else, it's like confidence boosting for a person for whom confidence

276
00:19:02,622 --> 00:19:07,683
boosts do not come readily. So like in, when it comes to games, I'm like, well, I feel knowledgeable

277
00:19:07,683 --> 00:19:12,605
about this one thing, even though I'm like insecure about whatever other aspects of life,

278
00:19:12,605 --> 00:19:15,646
at least games, I've been playing them all my life, I feel like.

279
00:19:16,908 --> 00:19:24,700
I at least know what I like and know how to articulate it, whether I can convey that successfully

280
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,463
to someone I'm working with, who knows.

281
00:19:29,189 --> 00:19:33,910
that did help me. It helped me not feel like I was completely out of my depth.

282
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:41,591
And it also, you know, what also helped me to my, I guess, to my delight or something is like,

283
00:19:41,591 --> 00:19:47,272
I didn't realize how much game developers cared about the gaming press.

284
00:19:47,272 --> 00:19:52,613
Like, I felt like a lot of people I came into, you know, this pretty big team at EA,

285
00:19:52,613 --> 00:19:57,094
you know, a hundred plus people, and I felt like a lot of them were just like,

286
00:19:59,129 --> 00:20:03,911
like appreciate it I I felt like surprisingly like appreciated it wasn't

287
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:07,913
like oh here's here's the outsider you don't know anything like your experience

288
00:20:07,913 --> 00:20:12,116
is garbage I was like oh cool you worked at GameSpot so they were very welcoming

289
00:20:12,116 --> 00:20:16,918
and that was that was a really it was an awesome team yeah a great group of

290
00:20:16,918 --> 00:20:22,321
people so they they made me it was you know it's a weird experience I'd only

291
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:26,303
worked at this one place basically for 10 years so it's like just leaving a

292
00:20:26,303 --> 00:20:27,144
group of people that

293
00:20:28,019 --> 00:20:34,166
that you've come to know quite well into like a totally new organization where you know, you know,

294
00:20:34,166 --> 00:20:41,033
initially only a couple of people. It's a big change. And I also moved, or didn't really move,

295
00:20:41,033 --> 00:20:45,118
but I started commuting down to Los Angeles for the job. So there's a lot of

296
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:49,443
life changes as part of that, but I felt very motivated to...

297
00:20:51,189 --> 00:20:55,812
again, at least give it a chance. Maybe I'd come crawling back to writing about games,

298
00:20:55,812 --> 00:20:59,335
but at least I'd be able to look back and say, I tried this other thing.

299
00:20:59,335 --> 00:21:02,818
Do you still think you're going to come crawling back to writing about games someday? Are you

300
00:21:02,818 --> 00:21:03,598
a lifer now?

301
00:21:03,598 --> 00:21:11,645
You know, I would be lying if I said the thought never crossed my mind during the course of

302
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:14,607
the time that's passed. But these days, certainly, I...

303
00:21:16,544 --> 00:21:23,311
I'm really, you know, at Supergiant with Bastion, our first game, that was the first time I

304
00:21:23,311 --> 00:21:27,556
got to do the sort of job of my eight-year-old dreams, right?

305
00:21:27,556 --> 00:21:34,503
Like building levels, writing worlds, writing characters, writing stories, putting it all

306
00:21:34,503 --> 00:21:38,527
into the game, like getting my hands dirty on the actual process of building the thing.

307
00:21:39,834 --> 00:21:52,905
And I've been doing equivalent work to that on our subsequent games, and that's work that I don't imagine I will grow tired of during my lifetime.

308
00:21:52,905 --> 00:21:59,111
I definitely enjoy what I do, but for all its ups and downs, basically the...

309
00:22:01,627 --> 00:22:04,309
I said it was a roller coaster.

310
00:22:04,309 --> 00:22:09,793
I think the highs were higher and the lows were lower compared to my experience at GameSpot,

311
00:22:09,793 --> 00:22:12,015
probably.

312
00:22:12,015 --> 00:22:18,099
But being able to put these things into the world and then see that people enjoy them

313
00:22:18,099 --> 00:22:23,203
definitely means a lot to me and feels like I'm getting to...

314
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:29,628
It's lived up to my dreams in that respect, as strenuous as it can be from time to time.

315
00:22:29,846 --> 00:22:35,856
Well, if you ever want to write again, I have a small freelance budget.

316
00:22:35,856 --> 00:22:36,136
Yeah.

317
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:42,290
I still love to, you know, every now and then I still get a chance to write about games

318
00:22:42,290 --> 00:22:44,872
and I still definitely enjoy it.

319
00:22:44,872 --> 00:22:50,596
And once in a while there's that like sleeper game that comes out and you know, you first

320
00:22:50,596 --> 00:22:54,759
hear about it through reviews and stuff and I'm like, ah, I miss, those are the best moments

321
00:22:54,759 --> 00:23:01,204
as a game critic when you like discover something and help spread the word about it, about why

322
00:23:01,204 --> 00:23:01,724
it's so great.

323
00:23:01,844 --> 00:23:11,126
Yeah. So moving on to, you know, closer to your current career status, uh, you know,

324
00:23:11,126 --> 00:23:16,648
journey, uh, like talk about journeys, like you go from bastion and honestly,

325
00:23:16,648 --> 00:23:22,749
Greg, I forgot that you didn't, you weren't like a co-founder of super giant

326
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:25,470
because I feel like your name is so attached.

327
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:31,633
to it now, but you actually came in a little bit after the founding and then worked on

328
00:23:31,633 --> 00:23:33,714
the end of Bastion?

329
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:40,798
I worked, yeah, it's a bit murky there because I was there for like a lot of the formative

330
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:44,299
discussions with Amir and Gavin when we were still down in LA.

331
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:48,522
I was like roommates with Amir and stuff like that, so we started, we were playing these

332
00:23:48,522 --> 00:23:48,962
games.

333
00:23:49,904 --> 00:23:55,289
I meant, there's like, I think it's like four games in particular that really struck me from that era,

334
00:23:55,289 --> 00:24:01,314
and I think the rest of us, it was like Braid, Castle Crashers, Plants vs. Zombies, and World of Goo,

335
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:09,822
were these like really just amazingly crafted games from small teams released at around that time, 2008-2009.

336
00:24:09,822 --> 00:24:15,167
And meanwhile, we're on this big team and we start, we're like...

337
00:24:16,006 --> 00:24:20,535
what could these games felt so like personal and so well made that we started wondering you know

338
00:24:20,535 --> 00:24:21,076
what could we do?

339
00:24:22,146 --> 00:24:26,028
if we could call the shots and just sort of have to do it ourselves.

340
00:24:26,028 --> 00:24:28,409
What would the constraints be and what kind of game would we make?

341
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:33,272
So we were excitedly having those discussions,

342
00:24:33,272 --> 00:24:38,976
and then Amir and Gavin bit the bullet and quit their jobs at EA

343
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:43,399
and moved up to Amir's dad's house in San Jose, California,

344
00:24:43,399 --> 00:24:46,661
which was vacated by his dad conveniently at the time,

345
00:24:46,661 --> 00:24:49,702
and founded Supergiant and got to work on Bastion.

346
00:24:50,585 --> 00:24:52,616
And I joined them, yeah, I joined them the following year.

347
00:24:53,936 --> 00:24:58,317
because in the intervening time I went to go work at 2k games that's based up

348
00:24:58,317 --> 00:25:05,059
here in the North Bay in California which is closer to my home because I'd

349
00:25:05,059 --> 00:25:08,600
been commuting to Los Angeles from Northern California for basically two

350
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:13,341
and a half years and and had to like pick up the pieces of my of my life

351
00:25:13,341 --> 00:25:17,242
outside of work and just sort of stabilize things I like the idea of

352
00:25:17,242 --> 00:25:21,504
going straight from my like commuting you know LA situation into like a

353
00:25:21,504 --> 00:25:22,184
startup company

354
00:25:23,504 --> 00:25:28,848
based an hour and a half away from where I was living was like a company yeah

355
00:25:28,848 --> 00:25:32,030
exactly so it was like it was like too much but but then you know we kept

356
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:38,995
talking and I reunited with them as as Bastion was going into full production

357
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:43,639
so so I yeah I got to do the you know writing and and design and all kinds of

358
00:25:43,639 --> 00:25:48,542
stuff on that game who's who's like you know founding principles were

359
00:25:49,568 --> 00:25:52,913
were near and dear to my heart as well as that of

360
00:25:52,913 --> 00:25:54,214
Amir and Gavin.

361
00:25:54,214 --> 00:25:59,041
And our team had grown to... we were seven people by the end of that game.

362
00:25:59,041 --> 00:26:00,163
So yeah, Transistor was the...

363
00:26:01,689 --> 00:26:06,470
Transistor was a game that we worked on first where we had like basically a like

364
00:26:06,470 --> 00:26:14,693
a full team from the start and we grew a little bit we grew to 12 full team yeah

365
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:17,853
yeah we did consider it a full team that's great yeah like I gotta say to

366
00:26:17,853 --> 00:26:25,336
supergiant games over the course of these four games Bastion, Transistor, Pyre,

367
00:26:25,336 --> 00:26:25,776
Hades.

368
00:26:26,316 --> 00:26:30,580
They all, you can tell what a Supergiant game is now.

369
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:37,665
There's such a clear line where these games build upon each other.

370
00:26:37,665 --> 00:26:50,536
How has your view on game design or any kind of philosophies that you take evolved as the four of those games were developed and released?

371
00:26:51,428 --> 00:27:11,855
Yeah, we, you know, I do think we have certain values in common from game to game, like we're always interested in that sort of, in the connection between the interactive experience and the narrative.

372
00:27:12,427 --> 00:27:16,751
experience and context like how can we tell stories in a unique way

373
00:27:16,751 --> 00:27:21,714
that that would not translate to other media how can we take advantage of

374
00:27:21,714 --> 00:27:25,297
what's unique about games in our approach to storytelling we

375
00:27:25,297 --> 00:27:27,919
really like storytelling and world building because we

376
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:31,522
think it helps make when when it's done effectively we

377
00:27:31,522 --> 00:27:33,483
think it helps make your your like

378
00:27:33,784 --> 00:27:40,307
experience in a game, it can make it feel more meaningful. It could add context and depth where

379
00:27:40,307 --> 00:27:48,190
it might not be there inherently through the mechanics alone. And we really value

380
00:27:48,190 --> 00:27:56,474
the presentation, the atmosphere of our games, and also things like making our games

381
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:01,961
available to players of like a wide range of skill levels.

382
00:28:01,961 --> 00:28:05,702
That's partly coming from our approach to narrative.

383
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:09,283
You know, there's nothing more frustrating in games where you're like

384
00:28:09,283 --> 00:28:13,545
really engaged with the story but then you just hit a wall, like a difficulty wall.

385
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:16,466
You just want to see how the story ends but you like can't,

386
00:28:16,466 --> 00:28:19,427
you can't make any more progress because,

387
00:28:19,427 --> 00:28:23,109
you know, because it's so, it's too much for you. So we try to

388
00:28:23,109 --> 00:28:25,249
build in systems into our games that, that...

389
00:28:26,550 --> 00:28:29,891
mitigate those kind of moments so that if you are engaged in the narrative but

390
00:28:29,891 --> 00:28:34,472
you haven't been playing games since you were six or whatever you can still work

391
00:28:34,472 --> 00:28:39,553
your way through and and have a good experience but yeah you know more more

392
00:28:39,553 --> 00:28:47,215
specifically each of our games has been like a reaction to the one before it in

393
00:28:47,215 --> 00:28:48,215
part because you know we

394
00:28:49,544 --> 00:28:53,706
ever since Bastion at least, each of our games has taken approximately three years, give

395
00:28:53,706 --> 00:29:00,389
or take, and by the time we're done with one, we've pretty deeply kind of explored whatever

396
00:29:00,389 --> 00:29:06,772
it was that we set out to do with that game, and we're kind of ready for something different

397
00:29:06,772 --> 00:29:08,053
in some way.

398
00:29:10,574 --> 00:29:18,916
uh so we naturally kind of lean into other other ideas you know transistor being uh the kind of

399
00:29:18,916 --> 00:29:24,678
first obvious example of this where we went from making this like very you know arcadey

400
00:29:24,678 --> 00:29:29,079
uh fantasy game in bastion to this like more deliberately paced

401
00:29:30,479 --> 00:29:34,962
almost like strategic science fiction game in Transistor.

402
00:29:34,962 --> 00:29:38,824
So there's some superficial similarities between the two,

403
00:29:38,824 --> 00:29:40,945
but the vibe of them I think is quite different

404
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:43,126
and how, you know, for us it felt like.

405
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:47,964
it felt very different to work on. And then once again with Pyre, Pyre is completely different

406
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:54,208
from Transistor. And then finally with Hades, this is back, you know, we started that game

407
00:29:54,208 --> 00:29:59,192
in 2017, just a few weeks after Pyre shipped. We finally said, hey, let's do like, let's

408
00:29:59,192 --> 00:30:03,035
pull together all the, all the best aspects of our previous games that we enjoyed working

409
00:30:03,035 --> 00:30:03,815
on and like build.

410
00:30:04,456 --> 00:30:09,939
something based on that because we'd been like sort of discarding our ideas

411
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:14,741
so much also like no no sequels like either I'm noticing is the supergiant

412
00:30:14,741 --> 00:30:17,463
just like we have to do something we want to do something different every

413
00:30:17,463 --> 00:30:17,743
time

414
00:30:18,819 --> 00:30:23,861
Yeah, we really, I personally really value the element of surprise.

415
00:30:23,861 --> 00:30:29,483
I think, you know, people have said there have been a, we're so grateful for the nice

416
00:30:29,483 --> 00:30:35,365
things that have been said about Hades across a lot of different aspects of the game.

417
00:30:35,365 --> 00:30:43,608
But I think like a quietly underrated aspect of why our games have been able to make people,

418
00:30:43,608 --> 00:30:46,729
you know, say nice things about them is that they surprise people.

419
00:30:47,644 --> 00:30:54,266
they... we... I think Surprise is really... when you go into a game and it just kind of plays out

420
00:30:54,266 --> 00:31:00,229
the way you think it's going to play out, I think it can only have so much of an impact on you. But

421
00:31:00,229 --> 00:31:04,751
when it does things that are like way beyond your expectations, those are the games I think that can

422
00:31:04,751 --> 00:31:06,131
really stick with you. And...

423
00:31:08,573 --> 00:31:11,356
you know cutting back to the bastion days

424
00:31:11,356 --> 00:31:14,560
it's like hey we have this dark horse advantage like no one knows what we're

425
00:31:14,560 --> 00:31:18,385
capable of as a team no one's heard of us so we could just do whatever

426
00:31:18,385 --> 00:31:21,849
and and make this game that just looks like a hack and slash arcade game

427
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:25,093
actually have a you know kind of a deeper experience to it

428
00:31:25,093 --> 00:31:26,875
and and i felt that that worked out very well

429
00:31:27,716 --> 00:31:32,240
uh... but it you know then bastion you know sort of put us on the map is a

430
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,621
small independent studio

431
00:31:33,621 --> 00:31:35,082
and it's like oh well

432
00:31:35,082 --> 00:31:39,005
maybe our dark horse advantage is gone forever and we can surprise people

433
00:31:39,005 --> 00:31:40,966
anymore that's part of why we

434
00:31:40,966 --> 00:31:44,589
we did transistor instead of like a like a bastion two would have been a very

435
00:31:44,589 --> 00:31:46,110
sensible thing to do

436
00:31:46,110 --> 00:31:48,152
uh... after bastion but we we didn't want

437
00:31:48,964 --> 00:31:49,964
like that wasn't

438
00:31:49,964 --> 00:31:53,586
the path that we were more excited about we want to ask ourselves like can we do

439
00:31:53,586 --> 00:31:55,847
this again because we loved

440
00:31:55,847 --> 00:31:59,568
you know building the world from scratch on bastion and seeing that people

441
00:31:59,568 --> 00:32:02,829
enjoyed it so we we want to see if we had like

442
00:32:02,829 --> 00:32:04,830
uh... the competency to be able to do it again

443
00:32:04,830 --> 00:32:06,951
uh... men so we've done that

444
00:32:06,951 --> 00:32:10,132
each time like priority prioritizing surprise but we

445
00:32:10,132 --> 00:32:12,993
you know we love the world of our games we've always said

446
00:32:12,993 --> 00:32:14,333
that like there's no reason

447
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:21,509
we wouldn't ever go back to them. It's just that when it comes time to decide what to do next,

448
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,637
we've just always been excited to try something new.

449
00:32:25,435 --> 00:32:30,199
I'm kind of curious about how that surprise plays out internally, because you see certain

450
00:32:30,199 --> 00:32:33,462
studios are known for a certain genre, a certain mechanic, and that is their niche, and they

451
00:32:33,462 --> 00:32:36,265
make games, very good games, along those lines.

452
00:32:36,265 --> 00:32:41,189
But how do you work with the team and manage a team that seems to be really mobile in the

453
00:32:41,189 --> 00:32:42,350
kind of game that they're making?

454
00:32:42,350 --> 00:32:46,473
How do you handle surprise internally with your developers who need to have these different

455
00:32:46,473 --> 00:32:48,555
skills to express different genres or different gameplay?

456
00:32:48,993 --> 00:32:56,514
Yeah, I mean, I think for us, it's hard, like, creating surprise or something through the play experience, I think...

457
00:32:57,832 --> 00:33:01,915
it's hard to be aware of that as a developer because you're iterating so

458
00:33:01,915 --> 00:33:05,357
like nothing is surprising to you necessarily as a developer

459
00:33:05,357 --> 00:33:08,759
because you've been iterating from the inside yeah or it's it's the thing you

460
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:12,142
know particularly with like story moments that are meant to be impactful

461
00:33:12,142 --> 00:33:14,403
like the like the ending of a game or something

462
00:33:14,403 --> 00:33:18,946
like that or some some key moment it's hard to keep perspective on that

463
00:33:18,946 --> 00:33:22,068
over the course of development just because you've seen it so many times

464
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:25,310
i think it's a pixar thing from back in the day they had

465
00:33:25,310 --> 00:33:25,791
i'm gonna

466
00:33:26,651 --> 00:33:29,431
I don't remember the exact wording, but they're like, remember the first...

467
00:33:29,431 --> 00:33:32,292
The idea is kind of remember the first moment, remember how you felt

468
00:33:32,292 --> 00:33:36,433
the first time you experienced this part in the story, because over time you're

469
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:40,353
gonna... you're gonna grow a bit numb to that. So

470
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:45,054
for us, I think it's like we look... we give ourselves time

471
00:33:45,054 --> 00:33:51,415
to do some of the small stuff. We don't over-schedule the work so that

472
00:33:51,415 --> 00:33:54,676
there's no room for the small... and I call it like...

473
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:59,531
this is a great expression but i call it like the dumb stuff in the game a little

474
00:33:59,531 --> 00:34:01,092
like it's the pointless stuff

475
00:34:01,092 --> 00:34:03,612
i say it in like a

476
00:34:03,612 --> 00:34:05,733
i mean it in an affectionate kind of way

477
00:34:05,733 --> 00:34:09,114
now i mean it in an affectionate way but the things that are unnecessary in a

478
00:34:09,114 --> 00:34:12,216
game i think are the things that actually like paradoxically you can make

479
00:34:12,216 --> 00:34:13,296
a game very special

480
00:34:13,296 --> 00:34:14,937
yet on the other side of the family

481
00:34:14,937 --> 00:34:16,237
and he's in and rather get

482
00:34:16,697 --> 00:34:20,839
We try to jam all our games full of it because you don't, we, as a developer, you actually

483
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:25,801
don't know which of those unnecessary pointless things a player is going to really respond

484
00:34:25,801 --> 00:34:26,101
to.

485
00:34:26,101 --> 00:34:31,323
But, you know, for me it's like, if you could just put enough of them, then one of them

486
00:34:31,323 --> 00:34:32,404
is going to work on you.

487
00:34:32,404 --> 00:34:34,845
There's so much of that in the writing, obviously.

488
00:34:35,245 --> 00:34:41,569
in Hades, you know, these tiny quote unquote dumb things where it's like, wait, the game

489
00:34:41,569 --> 00:34:43,250
knew that I did that.

490
00:34:43,250 --> 00:34:49,974
Yeah, and you know that, I mean, I think it's not a coincidence that working on stuff like

491
00:34:49,974 --> 00:34:53,637
that is also one of, it's fun.

492
00:34:53,637 --> 00:34:56,939
It's fun to be able to do the small kind of unnecessary things.

493
00:34:58,499 --> 00:35:05,702
it's more work, so you have to reconcile that, and it's the stuff that's the first on the chopping block if you run out of time.

494
00:35:05,702 --> 00:35:14,625
So I think it's quite tricky there, but again, we learned a lot of production discipline at EA, at our team.

495
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:25,188
Our team at EA was very efficient in making good games in a timely fashion, so we've just tried to get better and better.

496
00:35:26,530 --> 00:35:29,613
from a production standpoint and leave ourselves room

497
00:35:29,613 --> 00:35:32,596
for the individual creators on the team to sort of chase

498
00:35:32,596 --> 00:35:35,418
their passions through their work.

499
00:35:35,418 --> 00:35:37,961
And I mean, I see, like,

500
00:35:37,961 --> 00:35:42,525
when it comes time for us to decide on a new project,

501
00:35:42,525 --> 00:35:45,127
like the highest priority for us is like,

502
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:47,109
what will be the most exciting,

503
00:35:47,109 --> 00:35:48,611
or I shouldn't say the highest priority,

504
00:35:48,611 --> 00:35:51,433
but something we very actively think about is like,

505
00:35:51,433 --> 00:35:51,693
what...

506
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:59,677
what can our team... what will our team do in a unique way that we will most enjoy making?

507
00:35:59,677 --> 00:36:07,521
We don't like... we think about specifically what our skill sets can... what sort of game we can

508
00:36:07,521 --> 00:36:12,163
create as a team. We don't think about a game like in the abstract and then want to make it.

509
00:36:12,163 --> 00:36:13,264
It's like what can we do?

510
00:36:14,084 --> 00:36:18,565
knowing what Darren Korb, our composer and audio director, what is he excited about?

511
00:36:18,565 --> 00:36:20,666
What is Gen Z, our art director, excited about?

512
00:36:20,666 --> 00:36:24,987
Can we sort of synthesize those ideas into something?

513
00:36:24,987 --> 00:36:28,808
I find that excitement, that individual excitement, to me,

514
00:36:28,808 --> 00:36:33,050
is hugely important because game development can be, frankly, such a slog.

515
00:36:34,290 --> 00:36:42,255
and so much of it is not fun that the excitement can carry you through those sort of troughs

516
00:36:42,255 --> 00:36:46,038
in the development when you're like, ugh, you're stuck on a hard problem, you're not

517
00:36:46,038 --> 00:36:52,442
making progress as quickly as you thought, the sort of honeymoon period is over for how

518
00:36:52,442 --> 00:36:55,884
excited you initially might have been about the thing, but then you remember.

519
00:36:56,304 --> 00:37:02,809
that you saw this potential in it and you can remain inspired to keep doing work that matters to you.

520
00:37:02,809 --> 00:37:05,611
That shows through in all the games too.

521
00:37:05,611 --> 00:37:07,772
Thank you. I'm glad it does.

522
00:37:07,772 --> 00:37:11,755
Also, I want to talk a little bit too about...

523
00:37:11,755 --> 00:37:18,800
So there is actually some Twitter discourse this week having to do with writing,

524
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,461
and this comes up pretty frequently.

525
00:37:22,102 --> 00:37:26,883
about how so many games the writing is just kind of tacked on at the end.

526
00:37:26,883 --> 00:37:34,285
It's like an aesthetic that's supposed to make all the gameplay make sense, more cohesive.

527
00:37:34,285 --> 00:37:36,325
But that's not how Supergiant works, right?

528
00:37:36,325 --> 00:37:37,985
We, you know, that is partially true,

529
00:37:37,985 --> 00:37:41,286
but the part where we use narrative to, like,

530
00:37:41,286 --> 00:37:44,727
justify how the game works is absolutely one of the...

531
00:37:50,879 --> 00:37:56,101
one of the kind of functions of narrative in our game to make...

532
00:37:56,101 --> 00:38:02,222
I think of it as like an adhesive, it's like glue that seeps into the cracks

533
00:38:02,222 --> 00:38:11,525
of the game to make it all feel like it was all highly deliberate and every little piece was meticulously planned out.

534
00:38:11,525 --> 00:38:13,186
Like, the reality of game development...

535
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:20,385
it's not that clean. So you, like, these little bits and pieces are coming together at different

536
00:38:20,385 --> 00:38:25,927
times. Obviously a lot of different people are working on it. Even in a small team, you know,

537
00:38:25,927 --> 00:38:31,449
we're up to 19 people now for Hades, and it's still like different people with different

538
00:38:31,449 --> 00:38:36,331
perspectives putting their own work into the game. We want it to feel cohesive overall,

539
00:38:36,331 --> 00:38:38,672
but we don't want it to come from a place of like...

540
00:38:39,858 --> 00:38:42,839
you know you must do it this way you must all do it this way so that it's

541
00:38:42,839 --> 00:38:46,000
cohesive it's like the role of the story can be to find those connections

542
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:50,582
between otherwise disparate elements. And you as a writer aren't brought on in the last

543
00:38:50,582 --> 00:38:54,704
you know few months of development. Yes that's I guess that's a that's a key point I

544
00:38:54,704 --> 00:38:58,526
should have spoken to right away which is that you know we're thinking about

545
00:38:59,166 --> 00:39:04,931
the narrative and the themes of the game that we're working on from the start.

546
00:39:04,931 --> 00:39:12,278
We're highly design-driven. We don't start with a story and back-solve the gameplay onto it.

547
00:39:12,278 --> 00:39:14,740
That's never been our approach, but we're looking for...

548
00:39:16,218 --> 00:39:20,699
we're looking for that harmony where the design that we're interested in, the themes we're

549
00:39:20,699 --> 00:39:26,840
interested in exploring can be expressed also through the story and how it's told.

550
00:39:26,840 --> 00:39:34,721
And this applies across the board, like, you know, our music has been praised over time,

551
00:39:34,721 --> 00:39:42,102
the music of Darren Korb, and he's, you know, he's a genius and I love working with him

552
00:39:42,102 --> 00:39:43,263
and he's a wonderful guy.

553
00:39:45,445 --> 00:39:51,886
But part of the secret weapon, such as it is, is that he's there from the beginning.

554
00:39:51,886 --> 00:39:57,127
Like, one of the most important things that we do at the start of the project is start figuring out what the music is going to sound like.

555
00:39:57,127 --> 00:40:03,689
Because that helps identify the entire vibe and tone of the experience that then, you know,

556
00:40:03,689 --> 00:40:07,790
like even myself from a writing standpoint, you know, hearing the music a certain way,

557
00:40:07,790 --> 00:40:10,450
it's like, yeah, okay, this really clicks tonally.

558
00:40:10,450 --> 00:40:12,951
I want to write in such a way that supports...

559
00:40:13,471 --> 00:40:21,017
this music. Whereas you could bring on Hans Zimmer or something in the last year of production

560
00:40:21,017 --> 00:40:27,081
on a big game, and Hans Zimmer might deliver super amazing music, but it wouldn't necessarily

561
00:40:27,081 --> 00:40:33,807
be integrated as deeply as the music in a game like ours where we think of audio as a really

562
00:40:33,807 --> 00:40:39,731
vital part of the experience in creating an atmosphere and the overall mood. So yeah,

563
00:40:39,731 --> 00:40:41,392
it's another example of where thinking...

564
00:40:42,093 --> 00:40:45,217
Thinking about the role of the narrative, thinking about the role of the audio,

565
00:40:45,217 --> 00:40:49,563
and the artwork obviously right from the start of production I think leads to,

566
00:40:49,563 --> 00:40:54,590
makes it possible for us to get to a better result in those regards.

567
00:40:55,226 --> 00:41:00,247
Is that something that really benefits from what seems to be like a really deliberately small studio that you guys have?

568
00:41:00,247 --> 00:41:01,047
This like, tight-knit team?

569
00:41:01,047 --> 00:41:06,988
Yeah, it really, it really, really does. It's a good, um, thank you for bringing that up.

570
00:41:06,988 --> 00:41:13,670
We do, like, I do feel strongly that a lot of what we do only works because we're small.

571
00:41:13,670 --> 00:41:16,690
Like, I don't see how it could scale, necessarily.

572
00:41:16,690 --> 00:41:22,871
Um, we, like, we just, you know, a lot of it is that...

573
00:41:23,637 --> 00:41:28,179
there are these like long-standing personal relationships at the heart of the studio

574
00:41:28,179 --> 00:41:34,663
um with with like amir rao as kind of the i used i i would think of him as like the commander

575
00:41:34,663 --> 00:41:40,285
shepherd or whatever having assembled his like crack team uh all of us like were connected to

576
00:41:40,285 --> 00:41:47,609
amir in some way some of us knew you know i knew gavin um and and uh andrew wang our cto um

577
00:41:47,609 --> 00:41:51,151
like from la but you know like darren corb

578
00:41:51,822 --> 00:41:55,186
Amir knew, you know, like, since they were kids.

579
00:41:55,186 --> 00:41:59,892
And Logan Cunningham, who's been our principal voice actor in each of our games,

580
00:41:59,892 --> 00:42:06,740
him and Darren and Amir, you know, played like youth soccer or something when they were 10.

581
00:42:06,740 --> 00:42:10,264
So they all would go way back, and those longstanding relationships...

582
00:42:12,107 --> 00:42:19,273
help us to again, like, kind of work through everything and just be able to be

583
00:42:19,273 --> 00:42:27,420
sincere with each other and, yeah, build games around what we know our strengths are,

584
00:42:27,420 --> 00:42:33,745
as well as to, like, navigate one another's, kind of, you know, our idiosyncrasies as people.

585
00:42:33,745 --> 00:42:38,209
Like, we don't have to all work the same way as...

586
00:42:39,149 --> 00:42:43,395
you know, is expected to be the case sometimes at larger studios where you need more formal,

587
00:42:43,395 --> 00:42:45,518
you know, office hours or something like that.

588
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:51,627
When we're a small team we could just, it could just be more custom to the individuals

589
00:42:51,627 --> 00:42:53,289
that are there.

590
00:42:53,289 --> 00:42:55,512
Yeah, which I don't know that that can scale up.

591
00:42:55,720 --> 00:43:02,768
Yeah, the studio culture just speaking of that too. It's just interesting reading. I think that you gave an interview in 2019

592
00:43:02,768 --> 00:43:07,413
having uh, you know unlimited

593
00:43:07,413 --> 00:43:08,694
um, you know

594
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:11,878
Days off required 20 or so

595
00:43:11,878 --> 00:43:15,401
No emailing after 5 p.m on friday. I could get I could get into that one

596
00:43:15,862 --> 00:43:25,585
Oh boy, the no email, I was a big advocate for the no email after 5 on Fridays, because

597
00:43:25,585 --> 00:43:30,847
I was one of the people who was like wrecked by the opposite of that.

598
00:43:30,847 --> 00:43:32,347
I'd be, you know...

599
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:38,451
uh... at like a dinner with my wife and kids or whatever uh... and

600
00:43:38,451 --> 00:43:41,873
and still just sitting on my like i'll god damn it there's a cml like

601
00:43:41,873 --> 00:43:44,555
the the person who sent me the email

602
00:43:44,555 --> 00:43:48,177
had no intention of inconveniencing me and i had no intention to like

603
00:43:48,177 --> 00:43:53,840
district it like it was it was my fault right that i would i would sit there and

604
00:43:53,840 --> 00:43:57,402
not wanna like slow things down for other people you know all wait i have to

605
00:43:57,402 --> 00:43:58,302
answer this

606
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,763
so that the other person you know

607
00:44:00,567 --> 00:44:03,850
can keep on going and we realize that like sort of calling the ceasefire

608
00:44:03,850 --> 00:44:06,812
calling the truce after five uh... it made this really

609
00:44:06,812 --> 00:44:11,555
uh... it made a very tangible difference so that even

610
00:44:11,555 --> 00:44:12,956
you know i still

611
00:44:12,956 --> 00:44:13,576
i still work

612
00:44:13,576 --> 00:44:16,178
uh... evenings and weekends like whenever

613
00:44:16,178 --> 00:44:19,741
the heck i want to you know again when i'm adding dumb stuff to hades and

614
00:44:19,741 --> 00:44:20,821
having fun

615
00:44:20,821 --> 00:44:21,862
uh... some of that work

616
00:44:21,862 --> 00:44:22,542
i do on weekends

617
00:44:24,522 --> 00:44:28,403
but it's on my terms. And I do it in such a way that I'm...

618
00:44:28,403 --> 00:44:32,225
it has to be work that doesn't require anybody else. I'm not bothering nobody.

619
00:44:32,225 --> 00:44:37,626
It's not answering emails. Yeah, and so it makes... it just creates

620
00:44:37,626 --> 00:44:41,227
these quiet moments and made the weekends

621
00:44:41,227 --> 00:44:44,908
feel more like weekends. And, you know, yeah, from my

622
00:44:44,908 --> 00:44:47,869
gaming press days I certainly remember what it was like to just get

623
00:44:47,869 --> 00:44:50,990
emails non-stop and it's, yeah, it's kind of...

624
00:44:51,310 --> 00:44:56,074
creates like an oppressive feeling and having having times when it's quieter is

625
00:44:56,074 --> 00:45:05,101
really important. Yeah I'm gonna jump back to gushing about Hades. Yeah I just

626
00:45:05,101 --> 00:45:13,228
I just love so I feel like well I know that one of the reasons that Hades is so

627
00:45:13,228 --> 00:45:14,629
praised is because

628
00:45:15,489 --> 00:45:21,010
the consideration of the mechanics and the design and how that fits with the

629
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:26,592
narrative because you know that the story requires that's one thing I never

630
00:45:26,592 --> 00:45:32,633
I don't think I've ever played a roguelike that acknowledges that the

631
00:45:32,633 --> 00:45:38,354
death cycle and this is what Hades is about it's about dying over and over

632
00:45:38,354 --> 00:45:43,876
again and try you don't have that mechanic that design without the story

633
00:45:43,876 --> 00:45:44,656
that you set up

634
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:52,301
So which one came first? Was it like we're gonna do a roguelike or is it like

635
00:45:52,301 --> 00:45:56,143
you know or did like the story come first or they kind of come together

636
00:45:56,143 --> 00:45:57,244
naturally at the same time?

637
00:45:58,010 --> 00:46:04,995
Yeah, so I think the order of decisions was the first one, the first thing we decided

638
00:46:04,995 --> 00:46:12,500
was actually early access before there was any game idea at all. And that was partly, again,

639
00:46:12,500 --> 00:46:21,967
like in response to having worked on Pyre, where you basically work for three years without knowing

640
00:46:22,920 --> 00:46:26,082
what anyone is even gonna think of the thing.

641
00:46:26,082 --> 00:46:29,404
And we take it, you know, we announce it,

642
00:46:29,404 --> 00:46:31,605
we take it to PAX, we play test it.

643
00:46:31,605 --> 00:46:34,786
So we get a level of feedback along the way,

644
00:46:34,786 --> 00:46:37,948
but it's really different once you finally put it out there

645
00:46:37,948 --> 00:46:40,609
and kind of see truly what you've made.

646
00:46:40,609 --> 00:46:42,170
So our thought was like,

647
00:46:42,170 --> 00:46:46,032
can we test our ideas sooner rather than...

648
00:46:47,164 --> 00:46:50,947
rather than having to wait three years to find out how we did.

649
00:46:50,947 --> 00:46:56,391
And we also were drawn to early access because

650
00:46:56,391 --> 00:46:59,634
we felt it would lead to a more disciplined

651
00:46:59,634 --> 00:47:03,617
production approach where during the course of development of a game like

652
00:47:03,617 --> 00:47:07,840
Pyre, it's like a busted game through large

653
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:10,843
portions of development where we're tinkering away at different

654
00:47:10,843 --> 00:47:14,366
bits and pieces of it, but someone couldn't just...

655
00:47:15,026 --> 00:47:19,607
start the game and play through to the end during most phases of development

656
00:47:19,607 --> 00:47:22,668
because it's just all, you know, you're just still trying to build.

657
00:47:22,668 --> 00:47:25,429
Is it like an accountability thing when you're doing it?

658
00:47:25,429 --> 00:47:28,510
It's not really, um, it's not an accountability thing.

659
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:32,172
It's, well, I mean, I guess everything at some level is an accountability thing,

660
00:47:32,172 --> 00:47:36,313
but I think it's like a fault of the development process itself where we're not, um...

661
00:47:38,706 --> 00:47:44,152
where the things that we're working on are lower level and we're not testing the experience

662
00:47:44,152 --> 00:47:46,775
like end to end as like a priority.

663
00:47:46,775 --> 00:47:53,843
So we figured that with early access it means that we have to keep the game stable, problem

664
00:47:53,843 --> 00:47:57,907
free and playable end to end for the vast majority of the time.

665
00:48:00,870 --> 00:48:04,792
that means that once you're actually done with development,

666
00:48:04,792 --> 00:48:08,174
there should in theory be fewer problems.

667
00:48:08,174 --> 00:48:12,036
The way Gavin would put it is like,

668
00:48:12,036 --> 00:48:15,118
do you want to find the problems before the game is done

669
00:48:15,118 --> 00:48:16,378
or after the game is done?

670
00:48:16,378 --> 00:48:19,020
It's like, oh, that has an obvious answer.

671
00:48:19,020 --> 00:48:22,882
So, and also I think early access was,

672
00:48:22,882 --> 00:48:24,823
it was like different and scary

673
00:48:24,823 --> 00:48:26,203
in a way that was like attractive to us.

674
00:48:27,624 --> 00:48:33,870
So then, early access starts to apply some constraints on the kind of game you might want to make.

675
00:48:33,870 --> 00:48:40,496
Like, early access wouldn't have worked at all for a game like Transistor that's, you know, six or seven hours to play through.

676
00:48:40,496 --> 00:48:45,320
You just burn through a crappy version of it, and then never want to play it again.

677
00:48:45,320 --> 00:48:46,761
So we wouldn't get any feedback from...

678
00:48:48,517 --> 00:48:51,020
like you want you want to have a game that people

679
00:48:51,020 --> 00:48:52,101
are interested in

680
00:48:52,101 --> 00:48:54,624
playing for a decent amount of time so that you can get their

681
00:48:54,624 --> 00:48:57,267
get their feedback on it because otherwise why are you making

682
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:58,468
a game in early access so

683
00:48:58,468 --> 00:49:02,933
that drew us to the roguelike dungeon crawler genre which is something or or

684
00:49:02,933 --> 00:49:04,334
specifically to the roguelike genre

685
00:49:04,334 --> 00:49:04,374
uh...

686
00:49:06,170 --> 00:49:12,157
Because we were just playing and enjoying it. We were playing these games like Dead Cells and Slay the Spire, like a whole bunch

687
00:49:12,157 --> 00:49:16,201
around that time, just loving those games and thinking of these games like

688
00:49:16,201 --> 00:49:20,866
Binding of Isaac and Darkest Dungeon, Enter the Gungeon.

689
00:49:20,866 --> 00:49:23,349
Really cool games, but games that...

690
00:49:23,949 --> 00:49:29,671
didn't really prioritize the narrative experience necessarily which is something that our games

691
00:49:29,671 --> 00:49:34,412
have always done and we would think back to our bastion days when when we set out to make an

692
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:40,954
action rpg and we're like hey what if we just use this genre format for for storytelling maybe that

693
00:49:40,954 --> 00:49:45,415
will help distinguish this game and not make it look like a terrible diablo clone or something

694
00:49:45,415 --> 00:49:50,436
like that and that worked out so it was basically that same mindset of like hey can we use

695
00:49:50,917 --> 00:49:52,878
this genre format to tell a story.

696
00:49:52,878 --> 00:49:58,321
And a thing I would think about often is even in the hardest core

697
00:49:58,321 --> 00:50:02,403
roguelike game where it resets you completely to nothing

698
00:50:02,403 --> 00:50:05,665
from one playthrough to another, there is in fact something that you carry

699
00:50:05,665 --> 00:50:11,608
forward, which is your knowledge of the mechanics in the game, right?

700
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:14,570
So using your knowledge you can get farther and farther in a game like

701
00:50:14,570 --> 00:50:16,431
Spelunky or you name it.

702
00:50:18,438 --> 00:50:26,221
So it was a fun thought exercise to think of a game premise where the character had

703
00:50:26,221 --> 00:50:31,162
the same ability. So it leads you to, well, what sort of character would still remember

704
00:50:31,162 --> 00:50:34,363
what happened after they die? Well, what about a character who's just immortal? Like,

705
00:50:34,363 --> 00:50:38,124
they don't die for real. Because you don't really die for real in roguelike games. They

706
00:50:38,124 --> 00:50:41,945
don't uninstall themselves, right? You can play over and over. So it's just...

707
00:50:41,945 --> 00:50:46,206
Yeah. So it's trying to align. We're always trying to align.

708
00:50:46,807 --> 00:50:51,253
the player experience with the narrative.

709
00:50:51,253 --> 00:50:56,420
It leads, you know, having a character like Zagreus who can be serious one moment,

710
00:50:56,420 --> 00:51:01,107
self-deprecating another, you know, like snarky or whatever.

711
00:51:01,107 --> 00:51:01,327
He's...

712
00:51:02,246 --> 00:51:09,348
even though he has a lot of personality on his own, he in some ways he is there to sort of speak

713
00:51:09,348 --> 00:51:16,550
for the player's experience and just trying to find that strong, like I said before, that connection

714
00:51:16,550 --> 00:51:20,932
between the play experience and the story. So it all kind of flowed from there, that idea that

715
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:25,833
like what if there was a roguelike with narrative continuity where every time you run into a boss

716
00:51:26,174 --> 00:51:31,259
they remember, you know, they like, you know, you start keeping a tally of who won this time,

717
00:51:31,259 --> 00:51:37,385
who won last time. And it was fun to think about. It was, we had done a game with a complex

718
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:43,511
narrative and pyro just before, so it wasn't that intimidating of a starting point. And we started

719
00:51:43,511 --> 00:51:46,974
chipping away at it basically in early access. And then, yeah, here, and then here we are.

720
00:51:51,067 --> 00:51:55,869
It's a really interesting way, because when you go into early access, leading with a narrative foot,

721
00:51:55,869 --> 00:51:59,010
there's the risk that your players could get burnt out of your story so quickly,

722
00:51:59,010 --> 00:52:01,911
because you're going to be updating throughout, and they might have to restart their save or whatever,

723
00:52:01,911 --> 00:52:05,693
depending on how you do that. But the roguelike formula is so welcoming to that,

724
00:52:05,693 --> 00:52:08,254
that it's like it's a match made in heaven. It's really great.

725
00:52:08,254 --> 00:52:10,595
Thank you. Yeah, it's... I think it's a...

726
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:21,222
I think our consideration of those, we tried to find that match, like, consciously.

727
00:52:21,222 --> 00:52:27,124
Not knowing how it would work out, of course, but the, like, knowing that early access would

728
00:52:27,124 --> 00:52:32,645
have the sort of issues that you described, it led to the specific design choices and

729
00:52:32,645 --> 00:52:39,167
approach to the story that, you know, that ended up working out for us in the long run,

730
00:52:39,167 --> 00:52:41,648
in addition to during early access.

731
00:52:41,648 --> 00:52:43,068
You know, we, I approached it like...

732
00:52:44,999 --> 00:52:52,187
It was a fun challenge because it was different in a lot of ways, but like our previous games, you know, it's like dropping a big novel.

733
00:52:52,187 --> 00:52:56,772
It requires like a novel length amount of writing in it, I think.

734
00:52:56,772 --> 00:53:00,636
So it's just, you know, one day, boom, it's just this giant thing.

735
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:04,920
But with Hades, it felt more like a TV series or something where...

736
00:53:05,601 --> 00:53:07,582
our early access launches like the pilot.

737
00:53:07,582 --> 00:53:11,064
We're going to introduce some of the characters, we're going to set up the stakes for what

738
00:53:11,064 --> 00:53:15,206
the story is about, and we're going to allude to there being an ending eventually.

739
00:53:15,206 --> 00:53:22,390
But we basically added the ending of the game in our 1.0 launch.

740
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:26,312
So we built the beginning first, and then we introduced subplots and things along the

741
00:53:26,312 --> 00:53:26,592
way.

742
00:53:27,852 --> 00:53:31,814
again chip away at it with each of our major updates and then finally

743
00:53:31,814 --> 00:53:37,157
you know do the finale in the 1.0 launch that was our idea and

744
00:53:37,157 --> 00:53:39,618
and yeah that worked out well

745
00:53:39,618 --> 00:53:43,060
we wanted very much for the ending of the game to like live up to the

746
00:53:43,060 --> 00:53:46,582
expectations of our early access players because they were they were quite

747
00:53:46,582 --> 00:53:47,262
engaged

748
00:53:47,262 --> 00:53:48,883
with the story and the characters at that point

749
00:53:49,690 --> 00:53:54,195
Given the differences from releasing a game and hearing your community feedback versus

750
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:57,719
working on an early access game and having that feedback be more part of the development

751
00:53:57,719 --> 00:54:02,564
process, even if you say your next game isn't an early access game, are there lessons you

752
00:54:02,564 --> 00:54:06,469
can take from working with your community collaboratively into your next project, you

753
00:54:06,469 --> 00:54:06,609
think?

754
00:54:07,443 --> 00:54:15,109
I mean, there are for sure, but I think one of those big lessons is that early access is really valuable.

755
00:54:15,109 --> 00:54:21,434
So, I think if we didn't... That's not to say it is a foregone conclusion for whatever we do next.

756
00:54:21,434 --> 00:54:26,759
It's not, but it's something I think that we would have to give serious thought to considering.

757
00:54:28,182 --> 00:54:45,010
I think we would all agree that a part of the success of Hades, like a significant part of the success of Hades is owed to the early access development having gone well and resulted in this bigger and kind of cleaner game than we could have come up with on our own.

758
00:54:45,010 --> 00:54:51,672
I think we would, if we didn't do like early access in the traditional way, I think we would still very much want to have...

759
00:54:52,613 --> 00:55:00,898
like, figure out ways to get more feedback from more people sooner in development and more steadily.

760
00:55:00,898 --> 00:55:11,125
So that every step of the way as we're adding stuff to the game or changing stuff that we could be receptive to how...

761
00:55:11,125 --> 00:55:14,427
So that we could be receptive to how that's changing the experience,

762
00:55:14,427 --> 00:55:17,909
and like, which opportunities it's then creating for the game.

763
00:55:17,909 --> 00:55:20,711
Like, one of the really valuable things with Early Access is just that it lets you...

764
00:55:21,730 --> 00:55:24,163
it lets you stay

765
00:55:24,163 --> 00:55:24,645
it helps you

766
00:55:26,461 --> 00:55:32,205
like, see the forest for the trees, as it were, because, you know, again, a couple of

767
00:55:32,205 --> 00:55:35,627
years into development, you could get really down in the weeds on stuff and maybe start

768
00:55:35,627 --> 00:55:38,590
to lose perspective on what's really important for the game.

769
00:55:38,590 --> 00:55:42,993
Because with games, you could spend an infinite amount of time on basically any aspect of

770
00:55:42,993 --> 00:55:43,553
it.

771
00:55:43,553 --> 00:55:47,897
So, that decision of, like, when is it done?

772
00:55:47,897 --> 00:55:49,077
When do you move on?

773
00:55:49,077 --> 00:55:51,219
Is really tricky.

774
00:55:51,219 --> 00:55:51,659
And I don't...

775
00:55:53,592 --> 00:55:59,834
Yeah, it's tricky to make that, to decide that, so when you're working in early access,

776
00:55:59,834 --> 00:56:01,415
it can help you decide.

777
00:56:01,415 --> 00:56:06,417
Because if the whole community is like, this part's awesome, but this part is whack, or

778
00:56:06,417 --> 00:56:12,399
this part is missing, you know, what the game, the game is totally missing this, it can help

779
00:56:12,399 --> 00:56:15,820
jog that part of your brain when you're like, yeah, what am I doing?

780
00:56:15,820 --> 00:56:19,042
I keep tinkering away at this thing that everybody's happy with.

781
00:56:19,042 --> 00:56:21,903
Why don't I work on this thing that I know the game needs?

782
00:56:21,903 --> 00:56:22,763
So it just helped us.

783
00:56:23,695 --> 00:56:30,319
stay more focused on what mattered and stay like really motivated I think as well just to keep it

784
00:56:30,319 --> 00:56:37,043
it feels good to work on things that you know matter to people whereas in the thick of it

785
00:56:37,043 --> 00:56:42,386
while working on a game you can it's easy to lose sight of that in my in my experience like why you

786
00:56:42,386 --> 00:56:47,429
know why am I doing this like does it is anybody gonna care that goes with so many creative

787
00:56:47,429 --> 00:56:52,312
projects yeah exactly it's like because you're not I mean some creative projects you do

788
00:56:53,532 --> 00:57:02,834
It's important, you know, sometimes you do do it for yourself, but if you're doing it as your job,

789
00:57:02,834 --> 00:57:06,255
presumably you're also creating something for others, not just yourself.

790
00:57:06,255 --> 00:57:13,856
And if you're creating it for others, then you benefit from knowing what they actually think.

791
00:57:13,856 --> 00:57:17,357
You may not, it doesn't mean you have to do what they say,

792
00:57:17,357 --> 00:57:20,238
but you at least want to know how they're experiencing it and what they're...

793
00:57:21,323 --> 00:57:25,885
it's so valuable just hearing about people's experience with something you've worked on

794
00:57:25,885 --> 00:57:31,367
because you have your own hopes and dreams about how people will experience it, you know,

795
00:57:31,367 --> 00:57:35,348
oh this story moment, they're going to feel this way, but what do they actually feel?

796
00:57:35,348 --> 00:57:38,730
You know, did it land? So knowing whether your work is...

797
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,951
is resonating or connecting the way that you intend,

798
00:57:41,951 --> 00:57:46,036
lets you either make changes to get it closer to target

799
00:57:46,036 --> 00:57:48,118
or like proceed with more confidence

800
00:57:48,118 --> 00:57:49,940
than you might've had otherwise.

801
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,163
Yeah, getting more eyeballs on it

802
00:57:52,163 --> 00:57:55,167
and acting as a sanity check type thing too.

803
00:57:55,167 --> 00:57:55,747
Yeah, exactly.

804
00:57:56,888 --> 00:58:03,051
Well, we've had you for longer than usual, as far as our previous guests go, and I think

805
00:58:03,051 --> 00:58:08,393
that is just because you are great to talk to, and we love hearing what you have to say

806
00:58:08,393 --> 00:58:10,274
about game development and design.

807
00:58:10,274 --> 00:58:15,576
And I also appreciate how we're saying the word roguelike without any judgment around

808
00:58:15,576 --> 00:58:16,937
here.

809
00:58:16,937 --> 00:58:22,119
I think Metroidvania's fine, I think roguelike is fine, roguelite is fine.

810
00:58:23,400 --> 00:58:24,500
uh... so

811
00:58:24,500 --> 00:58:27,701
it genres are weird there there just short hands right it's like they're

812
00:58:27,701 --> 00:58:29,402
they're weird it like rpg

813
00:58:29,402 --> 00:58:34,343
yes like it doesn't it they don't that's the words themselves don't mean that

814
00:58:34,343 --> 00:58:35,924
anything when you think about it yet

815
00:58:35,924 --> 00:58:40,945
system rpg action adventure game of the year like the categories all their own

816
00:58:40,945 --> 00:58:42,406
and then they'll model together yeah

817
00:58:42,406 --> 00:58:46,587
i mean good great great him from like journalism journalism game journalism

818
00:58:46,587 --> 00:58:47,927
background

819
00:58:47,927 --> 00:58:49,888
we say what everyone wants to make it

820
00:58:49,888 --> 00:58:51,128
we make up the words

821
00:58:53,189 --> 00:58:56,311
So, well, thanks so much for joining us.

822
00:58:56,311 --> 00:59:01,134
And one last thing, I didn't know that, I actually didn't know that you voiced Hypnos.

823
00:59:01,134 --> 00:59:01,514
I did.

824
00:59:01,514 --> 00:59:04,135
Can you do a line as Hypnos in character?

825
00:59:04,135 --> 00:59:04,316
I can!

826
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:12,353
um was that was that the line um so yeah well i can't i i don't know that i i can't muster it

827
00:59:12,353 --> 00:59:18,457
that well um let's see because it's a voicing hypnos was really fun because it's just getting

828
00:59:18,457 --> 00:59:26,442
to completely switch to a different uh outlook on things but we got we got we got i can i that

829
00:59:26,442 --> 00:59:33,347
was that was hypnos thanks for dying welcome to the house of hades that's his kind of like

830
00:59:33,347 --> 00:59:33,767
classic line

831
00:59:34,914 --> 00:59:38,937
We do a little bit of processing on it, but I think I could get it close enough.

832
00:59:38,937 --> 00:59:42,140
No, thanks for dying. I mean, uh, that...

833
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:42,820
Yeah.

834
00:59:42,820 --> 00:59:45,542
We imagined him as like a, he's like a store greeter, right?

835
00:59:45,542 --> 00:59:50,085
That's like, that was, he's the guy, you know, yeah.

836
00:59:50,085 --> 00:59:52,867
Darren, who did all the voice directing, he's like, you know,

837
00:59:52,867 --> 00:59:55,309
Welcome to Walmart! You know, that sort of thing, so.

838
00:59:56,090 --> 01:00:00,131

839
01:00:00,131 --> 01:00:04,292
like yeah this is a programmer who did this voice here and it's incredible to like find those fun

840

facts so thank you for that amazing we have new ringtones now so yeah all right well thanks again

843
01:00:20,038 --> 01:00:22,458
thanks so much for having me on the show yeah

844
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:47,401
Hey, we are back.

845
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:50,704
I can't believe that we got Hypnos.

846
01:00:50,704 --> 01:00:52,265
We conjured Hypnos.

847
01:00:52,265 --> 01:00:56,467
Yeah, that was like a little fanboyish to kind of like be like, can you do the line

848
01:00:56,467 --> 01:00:56,908
at the end?

849
01:00:56,908 --> 01:00:57,468
But it paid off.

850
01:00:57,468 --> 01:00:58,188
Was I fawning?

851
01:00:58,188 --> 01:00:59,349
Was I fawning too much?

852
01:00:59,349 --> 01:00:59,950
A little bit.

853
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,651
It only came through most of the conversation.

854
01:01:01,651 --> 01:01:02,371
That's okay.

855
01:01:02,371 --> 01:01:03,412
I have more where that came from.

856
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:11,626
So yeah, I mean, like, what was it that stuck out to you that talked so many interesting points

857
01:01:11,626 --> 01:01:17,791
that Greg brought up? I really enjoy Supergiant as a concept. I don't know what that means,

858
01:01:17,791 --> 01:01:22,275
but the quality of game they put out and the kind of game they put out just oozes charm,

859
01:01:22,275 --> 01:01:26,599
and they do it with such a small team and do it so consistently. And then they took on early access

860
01:01:26,599 --> 01:01:31,223
and did the exact same thing. And it's just, it's really impressive. And it's always great to hear

861
01:01:31,223 --> 01:01:32,864
how that process goes off in the background.

862
01:01:33,354 --> 01:01:36,315
Yeah, so many other game developers must hate them.

863
01:01:36,315 --> 01:01:41,037
Supergiant just released another hit. Game developers hate them.

864
01:01:41,037 --> 01:01:46,059
This is unrelated, well this is kind of related, but like back when

865
01:01:46,059 --> 01:01:50,100
Pyre got announced for Supergiant was like right before PAX East and it was

866
01:01:50,100 --> 01:01:53,521
just kind of, if I'm remembering right, it was there's a mystery new

867
01:01:53,521 --> 01:01:57,123
Supergiant game that's going to be at PAX and I'm like I'm gonna be at PAX and

868
01:01:57,123 --> 01:01:58,803
I managed to snag an appointment last minute.

869
01:01:59,364 --> 01:02:04,968
and like the hype around that is just so very super giant and just kind of like it's that

870
01:02:04,968 --> 01:02:10,172
same kind of like fervor over this one studio's creation was carried forward into Hades and now

871
01:02:10,172 --> 01:02:15,476
everyone I talk to about Hades is just in love it's incredible. Totally. Have you bought Hades

872
01:02:15,476 --> 01:02:21,961
for anybody like for uh for the holidays or? No my partner plays a ton of it um so I count that as a gift.

873
01:02:23,282 --> 01:02:33,128
Yeah. So I, as far as these, uh, indie developers go, I think that it's like

874
01:02:33,128 --> 01:02:38,311
clay entertainment, like don't starve. Um, and they're, and they're also doing,

875
01:02:38,311 --> 01:02:45,475
uh, oxygen not included and super giant, I think, and subset, subset games like

876
01:02:45,475 --> 01:02:52,299
Into the Breach and FTL. I think those for me are just, how do you, how was this repeatable?

877
01:02:53,012 --> 01:02:57,734
I think my original question notes for this, I'm just like, what's the one secret behind

878
01:02:57,734 --> 01:03:00,876
having a small team doing all of this incredible stuff?

879
01:03:00,876 --> 01:03:05,619
And it's just the camaraderie that in every Supergiant interview you read, including this

880
01:03:05,619 --> 01:03:07,961
conversation, my dog in the background agrees.

881
01:03:08,981 --> 01:03:14,285
It's just like the way a small team can work as like one cohesive whole and just through

882
01:03:14,285 --> 01:03:19,029
people knowing each other and through people playing different parts with like voice acting

883
01:03:19,029 --> 01:03:23,333
and art design and just like all of these kind of like pieces of whole coming together

884
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:25,354
is this like community creation project.

885
01:03:25,354 --> 01:03:31,019
You can't have or read an interview with anybody from Supergiant without them throwing credit

886
01:03:31,019 --> 01:03:31,059
to...

887
01:03:32,380 --> 01:03:40,286
you know, uh, they're, they're, they're teammates on there. I mean, like, Gen Z, uh, you know,

888
01:03:40,286 --> 01:03:48,112
who does the art there, it's like that, that's, it's so, it's so, like, defining and sets them

889
01:03:48,112 --> 01:03:51,314
apart just visually. Uh, think that is.

890
01:03:51,634 --> 01:03:56,836
you know, just they're unlike any other indie game developer out there right now.

891
01:03:56,836 --> 01:04:01,878
Most to all, well not all, because they're solo dev projects, but like most projects are

892
01:04:01,878 --> 01:04:05,960
collaborations between teams and then it's just really wonderful when that kind of like

893
01:04:05,960 --> 01:04:08,881
energy comes through in every element of a thing, like with Hades.

894
01:04:09,245 --> 01:04:16,749
Yeah. And the, uh, I could have, you know, we could have talked to Greg for so much longer

895
01:04:16,749 --> 01:04:24,774
about narrative design, uh, just because I think, I think like in the next few, like it, like in a

896
01:04:24,774 --> 01:04:31,938
few years, we're going to see more roguelikes that adopt that are clearly influenced by Hades.

897
01:04:32,578 --> 01:04:37,162
like there is, there's a template now, I feel like.

898
01:04:37,162 --> 01:04:38,944
So I think this is just going to be,

899
01:04:38,944 --> 01:04:42,707
Hades in particular from Supergiant is going to be influential

900
01:04:42,707 --> 01:04:47,511
and, you know, making more interesting,

901
01:04:47,511 --> 01:04:49,112
narratively interesting roguelikes

902
01:04:49,112 --> 01:04:52,095
that aren't just about, you know, getting really far

903
01:04:52,095 --> 01:04:55,678
and then, you know, and then dying and then rage quitting.

904
01:04:55,678 --> 01:04:56,619
That's how I play them anyway.

905
01:04:56,759 --> 01:05:03,202
There's nothing wrong with that also, but like there's not I don't want to disparage like other, you know, because I've I love spelunky

906
01:05:03,202 --> 01:05:11,486
I love I love yeah. Yeah. I mean like dead dead cells is is

907
01:05:11,486 --> 01:05:16,628
Amazing enter the gungeon. I got so into that. I love that format. I guess what I'm saying is that

908
01:05:17,969 --> 01:05:21,351
the consideration that you take is like, okay,

909
01:05:21,351 --> 01:05:28,856
I appreciate how the whole cycle of trying and dying

910
01:05:28,856 --> 01:05:32,518
and trying and dying is accounted for in the story.

911
01:05:32,518 --> 01:05:34,279
It makes it more interesting to fail.

912
01:05:34,960 --> 01:05:38,162
Yeah, I would say a lot of, excuse me, a lot of like roguelikes have that

913
01:05:38,162 --> 01:05:43,327
narrative interweave in there, but Hades leans into it so much that like, it'll

914
01:05:43,327 --> 01:05:46,729
be interesting to see how that spins off into other games, maybe other genres

915
01:05:46,729 --> 01:05:50,312
that just, I love a good narrative heavy game and just having that so tightly

916
01:05:50,312 --> 01:05:52,054
interwoven, it's just, it's good narrative design.

917
01:05:52,054 --> 01:05:52,294
Yeah.

918
01:05:52,294 --> 01:05:56,858
Um, it makes you, it, it takes the sting out of, you know, one of the

919
01:05:56,858 --> 01:05:59,420
main components of roguelikes, which is failing in death.

920
01:05:59,420 --> 01:05:59,600
Yeah.

921
01:06:02,757 --> 01:06:04,959
Ending on a happy note, failing in bed.

922
01:06:04,959 --> 01:06:10,123
I was just going to say, that's not darker than I meant it to, but yeah, I know.

923
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:17,410
And then of course there's, um, I think a lot of the, um, end of 2020 roundup

924
01:06:17,410 --> 01:06:21,873
bliss that a lot of them, if not every single one of them did include.

925
01:06:21,873 --> 01:06:27,578
Hades talked about Hades, uh, is inadvertently the game that represents a 2020.

926
01:06:28,859 --> 01:06:35,865
You know, the best, because it's just trying to escape hell over and over again, failing

927
01:06:35,865 --> 01:06:37,045
most of the time.

928
01:06:37,045 --> 01:06:38,446
But with charm.

929
01:06:38,446 --> 01:06:39,187
With charm.

930
01:06:39,187 --> 01:06:45,151
You gotta have that charm, that old 2020 charm.

931
01:06:45,151 --> 01:06:46,352
But we're not in 2020 anymore.

932
01:06:46,352 --> 01:06:46,853
No.

933
01:06:46,853 --> 01:06:49,955
And the hell's going on anyway.

934
01:06:52,643 --> 01:06:56,065
Yeah, so anyway, thank you for joining us for this conversation.

935
01:06:56,065 --> 01:07:00,327
If you like hearing us talk to game developers about the amazing things they do, you can find
