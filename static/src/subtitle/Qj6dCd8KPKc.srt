1
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:14,632
So this is a case for making your own game engine, which is a loaded topic.

2
00:00:15,853 --> 00:00:16,153
All right.

3
00:00:17,053 --> 00:00:17,533
I'll get started.

4
00:00:17,553 --> 00:00:18,314
My name is Rez Graham.

5
00:00:18,414 --> 00:00:19,655
I've been making games for a long time.

6
00:00:20,035 --> 00:00:23,457
I want to start, before anything else, with a poll.

7
00:00:24,237 --> 00:00:33,923
By show of hands, how many of you are working on a project of which you are using an off-the-shelf engine, such as Unity, Unreal, Godot, something like that?

8
00:00:35,332 --> 00:00:35,892
like everyone.

9
00:00:36,012 --> 00:00:36,232
Okay.

10
00:00:36,512 --> 00:00:38,693
How many of you are using your own tech by show of hands?

11
00:00:39,634 --> 00:00:40,254
Oh, my God.

12
00:00:40,534 --> 00:00:41,894
A shocking number of people.

13
00:00:42,995 --> 00:00:43,295
It's funny.

14
00:00:44,335 --> 00:00:45,856
I do rehearsals for all this stuff, right?

15
00:00:45,896 --> 00:00:50,778
And every time I did a rehearsal, I was prepared to have some line that was like, oh, yes, only three of you or something like that.

16
00:00:51,038 --> 00:00:52,438
I'm shocked at how many of you are doing it.

17
00:00:52,498 --> 00:00:53,039
That's awesome.

18
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:58,521
So I feel like I've started early.

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:00:59,381
Is that a bad thing?

20
00:01:00,912 --> 00:01:01,172
No?

21
00:01:01,392 --> 00:01:01,613
Okay.

22
00:01:01,653 --> 00:01:02,513
We're just going to go rogue.

23
00:01:02,613 --> 00:01:02,974
Here we go.

24
00:01:03,594 --> 00:01:08,878
So I'm partially surprised that this talk was chosen at all.

25
00:01:08,978 --> 00:01:13,322
Because usually when I have this conversation, this is the reaction that I get.

26
00:01:13,662 --> 00:01:20,767
And those of you basically on this side of the room who are working on your own thing, working on your own tech, I wonder if you get a similar reaction to this.

27
00:01:21,528 --> 00:01:23,249
Because I certainly do.

28
00:01:25,121 --> 00:01:25,861
I know, it's insane.

29
00:01:26,361 --> 00:01:29,122
Here's the thing, and I'll just get this out of the way right away.

30
00:01:29,802 --> 00:01:35,844
I am not saying you should build like a fancy, super powerful, you know, Unreal or Unity competitor.

31
00:01:35,904 --> 00:01:37,604
That is not what I'm saying at all.

32
00:01:38,325 --> 00:01:39,565
I think that's probably the wrong choice.

33
00:01:39,605 --> 00:01:41,705
I'm just, you know, a little baby, a little baby engine.

34
00:01:42,226 --> 00:01:43,606
That's what I'm talking about, right?

35
00:01:45,286 --> 00:01:47,187
You may not actually need all of Unity.

36
00:01:48,709 --> 00:01:52,992
The other disclaimer that I have is that mostly this talk is for programmers.

37
00:01:54,013 --> 00:01:55,694
If you're a designer, you can get something out of this.

38
00:01:55,714 --> 00:01:57,095
If you're an artist, you can get something out of this.

39
00:01:57,155 --> 00:01:59,177
But mostly I'm talking to the programmers in the room.

40
00:01:59,897 --> 00:02:04,100
The reality of creating your own engine does require a bit of technical knowledge to be able to go.

41
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:06,462
So that's the other disclaimer that I'll make.

42
00:02:07,868 --> 00:02:10,009
So I am Reds.

43
00:02:10,029 --> 00:02:13,029
You may not know who I am, since I've never spoken at the Indie Summit.

44
00:02:13,109 --> 00:02:15,230
Again, usually I'm across the street in the AI Summit.

45
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:17,250
I've been working in games for a very long time.

46
00:02:17,290 --> 00:02:18,831
I've been programming for a very long time.

47
00:02:18,851 --> 00:02:22,071
And I've been teaching for a bit less of time, but still quite a long time.

48
00:02:22,571 --> 00:02:23,792
I've worked at a bunch of companies.

49
00:02:24,072 --> 00:02:25,232
I've made a bunch of games.

50
00:02:25,732 --> 00:02:27,873
The smallest team I've worked on was 2 and 1 half people.

51
00:02:27,933 --> 00:02:30,033
The largest team I've worked on was 250 people.

52
00:02:30,093 --> 00:02:34,094
So I've gone from AAA and Indie and back and forth.

53
00:02:34,194 --> 00:02:35,935
And I do a lot.

54
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:46,663
some of the stories I'm going to tell, in fact all the stories I'm going to tell come from real games I probably can't name names because they're not always positive stories but I'll tell them anyway

55
00:02:47,778 --> 00:02:48,639
So let's get started.

56
00:02:48,679 --> 00:02:50,179
What is an actual game engine?

57
00:02:50,320 --> 00:02:52,481
When I say game engine, it's such a loaded term.

58
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:55,242
There are people who think things like SDL are game engines.

59
00:02:55,543 --> 00:03:00,506
There are people who think that Unity is barely a game engine, or Ogre 3D.

60
00:03:00,846 --> 00:03:03,587
So let's define what this actually is.

61
00:03:04,188 --> 00:03:06,189
It's basically a bunch of code and or other tools.

62
00:03:06,229 --> 00:03:07,209
That's pretty much what it is, right?

63
00:03:07,249 --> 00:03:10,892
It's just a bunch of code that is somehow all lumped together.

64
00:03:11,412 --> 00:03:12,993
But I think we have different gradients of this.

65
00:03:13,493 --> 00:03:16,055
So we have this code to engine axis.

66
00:03:16,835 --> 00:03:23,366
All the way on the left we have simple libraries, just stuff like, you know, math libraries, zlib, tiny xml, things like that.

67
00:03:23,847 --> 00:03:30,818
They're literally just a pile of functions, a pile of classes that you can just call and they solve a particular problem hopefully quite well.

68
00:03:31,863 --> 00:03:33,825
Moving down our list we have something like frameworks.

69
00:03:33,985 --> 00:03:38,468
Frameworks are, it's the exact same thing except that the code all sort of works together.

70
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:45,093
You know, things like SDL, SFML, and I would even say things like Pygame or the sadly dead XNA.

71
00:03:46,193 --> 00:03:50,637
These are all things, yeah, thank you XNA fanboys, the one that's in the room.

72
00:03:52,097 --> 00:03:54,119
These are all frameworks.

73
00:03:54,139 --> 00:03:55,760
These are all things that we build upon.

74
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:58,481
But they solve very specific problems as well.

75
00:03:58,581 --> 00:03:59,542
They just work together.

76
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:05,725
Then we start getting into what we would consider real engines, like generic engines, like Unity, Unreal, Godot, all the ones that we all know and love.

77
00:04:06,206 --> 00:04:08,487
And then we start getting into really specific stuff.

78
00:04:08,807 --> 00:04:19,435
stuff that's like RPG Maker, you know, Ren'Py, those types of things that are like, if you're going to make this very specific kind of game, and this engine is specifically designed to make that kind of game, great, right?

79
00:04:19,835 --> 00:04:23,738
Use Pygame if you want to make an interactive sort of novel.

80
00:04:25,231 --> 00:04:29,074
So we have this wide gradient of things.

81
00:04:29,355 --> 00:04:37,442
And I think most of us live, if I were to just take the average of the engines that are used, probably about here somewhere.

82
00:04:37,762 --> 00:04:38,883
We're probably right about here.

83
00:04:39,804 --> 00:04:42,907
And I feel like we could move it a little bit over here.

84
00:04:43,808 --> 00:04:44,708
That's kind of my pitch.

85
00:04:45,489 --> 00:04:47,391
So what does this buy you?

86
00:04:47,411 --> 00:04:49,212
What does a game engine actually buy you?

87
00:04:50,189 --> 00:04:51,250
And that's really the thing to think about.

88
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:53,011
So why should you use a game engine?

89
00:04:53,192 --> 00:04:55,333
Why should you consider not using a game engine?

90
00:04:55,794 --> 00:04:57,355
The thing to ask yourself is, what is it about you?

91
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:58,536
Games are just problems.

92
00:04:58,556 --> 00:04:59,557
They're problems that have to be solved.

93
00:04:59,597 --> 00:05:01,339
I have to render triangles onto a screen.

94
00:05:01,599 --> 00:05:02,580
I have to play sounds.

95
00:05:02,820 --> 00:05:05,983
I have to handle somebody pressing something on an input device.

96
00:05:06,923 --> 00:05:08,365
These are all problems that have to be solved.

97
00:05:09,485 --> 00:05:16,652
And if your engine doesn't actually solve those problems completely, it might as well not solve them most of the time.

98
00:05:17,695 --> 00:05:21,117
So I'll give you a couple of very real examples.

99
00:05:22,037 --> 00:05:23,158
And the first one I'll use Unity.

100
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:25,499
I'll kind of shit on all the engines, but I'll start with Unity.

101
00:05:27,140 --> 00:05:27,940
So game objects.

102
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:29,161
Game objects are fine, right?

103
00:05:29,201 --> 00:05:30,381
Mono behavior is fine.

104
00:05:30,581 --> 00:05:32,402
It's a basic game object component system.

105
00:05:32,422 --> 00:05:32,883
That's fine.

106
00:05:33,003 --> 00:05:38,245
I worked on a project where many projects have a few objects.

107
00:05:39,046 --> 00:05:41,187
This project had a lot of objects.

108
00:05:41,927 --> 00:05:46,671
and now the heavy weight of mono behavior starts weighing down the project.

109
00:05:47,132 --> 00:05:49,494
So we couldn't use the game object system.

110
00:05:49,634 --> 00:05:50,475
It was just too much.

111
00:05:50,955 --> 00:05:56,640
So we built our own game object system and rewired from unity to get game object system, right?

112
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,765
So we had there's literally one game object spawned in the scene and that was our hook into the update.

113
00:06:02,785 --> 00:06:04,687
So we had to like do extra work

114
00:06:05,187 --> 00:06:07,489
to get our own object system in there.

115
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:17,396
That particular game is a poster child for this talk, because literally all that the game used was rendering, audio, input, the fact that it's C sharp.

116
00:06:18,657 --> 00:06:19,157
It's about it.

117
00:06:19,397 --> 00:06:21,779
I mean, so it's like we could have done this another way.

118
00:06:24,201 --> 00:06:27,063
That is a different horror story, though, of maybe don't ship your prototypes.

119
00:06:28,058 --> 00:06:31,179
The next example, we're all crap on another engine, is Unreal.

120
00:06:31,279 --> 00:06:33,100
So this is an interview that I had.

121
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:36,722
So I went on a technical interview, and they wanted me for some lead AI position.

122
00:06:37,342 --> 00:06:43,405
And for NDA reasons, I can't talk about the specific game, but I will say that they had a strong networking component to it.

123
00:06:43,645 --> 00:06:45,966
They needed to do a lot of fancy networking stuff.

124
00:06:45,986 --> 00:06:48,507
And I'm like, how are you going to do that in Unreal?

125
00:06:48,567 --> 00:06:52,028
Unreal supports networking, but what you want to do seems a little out of scope.

126
00:06:52,369 --> 00:06:55,290
And they're like, yeah, we're literally ripping out and rewriting all of networking.

127
00:06:56,144 --> 00:06:56,785
which is hard.

128
00:06:57,466 --> 00:07:01,492
Not just because networking is hard, but because ripping it out of Unreal is hard.

129
00:07:02,674 --> 00:07:08,602
So if it doesn't solve your problem 100%, it might as well not solve your problem most of the time.

130
00:07:08,883 --> 00:07:10,846
Sometimes you can extend, but not always.

131
00:07:12,287 --> 00:07:13,147
So let's look at the other side.

132
00:07:13,187 --> 00:07:14,428
How much does it actually cost you?

133
00:07:14,508 --> 00:07:18,670
Well, the obvious answer is financial, not for all engines, but for many engines, right?

134
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:19,751
There's a financial cost.

135
00:07:20,091 --> 00:07:22,432
And you can do the math, which is a simple math.

136
00:07:22,472 --> 00:07:25,494
You take your licensing fees and subtract what time you think it's going to save you.

137
00:07:26,094 --> 00:07:28,275
And if that cost is greater than the benefit, well, great.

138
00:07:29,546 --> 00:07:31,026
The answer is clear, right?

139
00:07:31,106 --> 00:07:35,187
Maybe if that cost is over the benefit, then financially, it doesn't make sense to do this.

140
00:07:35,507 --> 00:07:36,127
Make your own thing.

141
00:07:37,187 --> 00:07:38,348
But this doesn't apply to everything, right?

142
00:07:38,388 --> 00:07:47,429
Godot and Ren'Py and other things like... Godot is sort of this up-and-comer, which I'm excited about personally, even though I'm giving a talk about not using game engines, because it's open source.

143
00:07:49,089 --> 00:07:52,730
Anyway, there's a second reason, which is, I think, a little more insidious, right?

144
00:07:52,910 --> 00:07:57,611
The financial reason we can throw off, but there's another reason, which is constraints.

145
00:07:59,014 --> 00:08:00,155
You have design constraints, right?

146
00:08:00,195 --> 00:08:01,796
Maybe it's only good at making a particular kind of game.

147
00:08:01,836 --> 00:08:07,038
And even if you're using Unity, how many of you have looked at the Steam store and said, oh yeah, that's the Unity shader, right?

148
00:08:07,318 --> 00:08:08,439
Like, we've all seen that.

149
00:08:08,719 --> 00:08:12,501
How many of you looked at Unreal games or whatever, and it's like, oh, there's that weird lighting thing that Unreal does.

150
00:08:12,541 --> 00:08:15,483
So you're making a style of game.

151
00:08:15,503 --> 00:08:16,463
They're good at making things.

152
00:08:16,583 --> 00:08:20,686
I'm not going to use, if I'm really good at Unreal, I'm probably not going to make a 2D game.

153
00:08:20,786 --> 00:08:22,947
Like, Unreal is not as good at making 2D games.

154
00:08:22,987 --> 00:08:24,608
You fight the engine in certain cases.

155
00:08:25,048 --> 00:08:29,010
You fight it if you want to try and have it ship on a device like this.

156
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:30,471
You can do it, of course you can.

157
00:08:31,311 --> 00:08:35,494
But it's not as good as other engines that are used to doing it, and maybe not even as good as doing your own thing.

158
00:08:36,094 --> 00:08:37,555
There are also technical constraints.

159
00:08:38,896 --> 00:08:40,216
How many objects can you have in the world?

160
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:43,458
You're constrained by that, by whatever the engine has.

161
00:08:44,058 --> 00:08:46,480
You're constrained by whatever platforms the engine supports.

162
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:49,021
Does it support the platforms that you actually want to ship on?

163
00:08:49,061 --> 00:08:49,421
I don't know.

164
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:51,642
Probably, nowadays.

165
00:08:53,588 --> 00:08:54,648
does it really, right?

166
00:08:54,709 --> 00:08:57,870
So, but that's not even the worst for me.

167
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:19,380
The worst, and when I started working on my own project, one of the biggest reasons I chose not to use an engine and use my own code is when you tie your star to another engine, to a third-party body of code, you are now tying the success of your company to not only the success of that company, but the whims of that company.

168
00:09:21,123 --> 00:09:24,126
Unity made an interesting decision not too long ago.

169
00:09:26,968 --> 00:09:27,929
They did, right?

170
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,431
And here's the crazy thing.

171
00:09:30,551 --> 00:09:35,955
The only reason, sorry camera guy, the only reason that that didn't work, why did that not work?

172
00:09:36,636 --> 00:09:38,217
Because they don't have a monopoly.

173
00:09:38,497 --> 00:09:40,179
They don't have the monopoly that they think they do.

174
00:09:40,499 --> 00:09:42,321
There's Unreal, there's Godot, there's other things.

175
00:09:42,961 --> 00:09:43,742
I live in the Bay Area.

176
00:09:43,782 --> 00:09:45,063
Does anybody here live in the Bay Area?

177
00:09:46,283 --> 00:09:47,004
Okay.

178
00:09:47,224 --> 00:09:50,306
Basically the same people making their own tech.

179
00:09:50,886 --> 00:09:51,487
Here's the thing.

180
00:09:52,888 --> 00:09:57,131
For electricity, to pay for this electricity, I pay PG&E, Pacific Gas and Electric.

181
00:09:57,551 --> 00:10:00,133
If I'm unhappy with them, my one choice is this.

182
00:10:00,693 --> 00:10:02,595
I cannot have electricity and gas.

183
00:10:02,695 --> 00:10:03,395
That's my choice.

184
00:10:03,495 --> 00:10:04,316
That's all I have.

185
00:10:04,676 --> 00:10:06,858
They have a monopoly on it.

186
00:10:08,623 --> 00:10:14,128
So any game engine that you tie your success to, they can change the deal.

187
00:10:14,508 --> 00:10:15,649
Unreal just changed their deal.

188
00:10:15,709 --> 00:10:16,430
Now, it's not for us.

189
00:10:16,590 --> 00:10:18,031
It's for film and all that stuff.

190
00:10:18,051 --> 00:10:18,912
But of course they did.

191
00:10:21,374 --> 00:10:22,595
These are for-profit companies.

192
00:10:23,455 --> 00:10:26,238
They're not about your success.

193
00:10:26,258 --> 00:10:27,839
They're about their success, which is fair, right?

194
00:10:27,899 --> 00:10:28,640
I mean, it has to be.

195
00:10:29,520 --> 00:10:32,303
But you tie your star to theirs.

196
00:10:34,985 --> 00:10:37,227
That's a cost, and possibly one of the biggest ones.

197
00:10:38,705 --> 00:10:40,446
Okay, rolling your own engine.

198
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,527
I know, I'm a little crazy about this, but again, I'm gonna say this again, right?

199
00:10:44,887 --> 00:10:46,608
You're not making something super generic, right?

200
00:10:46,668 --> 00:10:47,909
You wanna make exactly what you want.

201
00:10:47,949 --> 00:10:49,729
I'm actually saying basically make the game.

202
00:10:50,169 --> 00:10:50,990
Don't worry about the engine.

203
00:10:51,010 --> 00:10:53,431
You can pull in libraries and things to solve specific things.

204
00:10:54,171 --> 00:11:01,854
You're probably not, I mean, unless you're in the wrong room, you're probably not trying to remake a massive AAA, you know, the next Dragon Age.

205
00:11:03,115 --> 00:11:04,115
Or maybe you are, that'd be awesome.

206
00:11:05,128 --> 00:11:06,369
All right, so what goes into a game engine?

207
00:11:06,989 --> 00:11:08,310
Well, kind of a lot.

208
00:11:09,111 --> 00:11:10,372
Let's rattle through some of these, right?

209
00:11:10,572 --> 00:11:15,636
We have platform abstractions, rendering, sound, input, physics, if your game uses physics, world representations.

210
00:11:15,676 --> 00:11:17,277
I mean scenes, levels, that kind of stuff.

211
00:11:17,577 --> 00:11:22,301
Game objects, UI, resources, an editor, the heartbeat of the game.

212
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,123
And that's the last bullet point, for those of you taking pictures.

213
00:11:26,744 --> 00:11:27,304
It's a lot.

214
00:11:27,364 --> 00:11:28,225
We have a lot of stuff.

215
00:11:28,365 --> 00:11:30,166
But we can build this kind of stuff.

216
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:31,387
We really can.

217
00:11:33,448 --> 00:11:35,009
How can we make all of these types of things?

218
00:11:35,109 --> 00:11:42,331
Well, we can start with frameworks, libraries, that kind of stuff.

219
00:11:42,351 --> 00:11:43,291
And I'll give an example.

220
00:11:43,531 --> 00:11:47,853
Let's say that you're making a project, and we need to build all of these things.

221
00:11:48,473 --> 00:11:53,315
I would start with a very basic and a very simple framework.

222
00:11:54,460 --> 00:12:02,503
So something like SDL, SFML is also fine if you're more of a C++ person, but SDL is just a bucket of functions that you can use.

223
00:12:02,903 --> 00:12:06,584
It is free, it is open source, so you can make changes if you really want to.

224
00:12:07,004 --> 00:12:11,366
There's OS, rendering, sound, input, probably a bunch of other things, and you don't have to use any of them.

225
00:12:11,726 --> 00:12:16,148
It's well known, it's used in actual commercial products, right?

226
00:12:16,208 --> 00:12:19,429
It's used in real games, used in real things that have shipped.

227
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:22,050
So it's solid, is what I'm trying to say there.

228
00:12:22,531 --> 00:12:31,156
Many of them use it just for operating system stuff, just to be like, I don't want to deal with writing Mac code and deal with writing, you know, Android code or any of that stuff.

229
00:12:31,196 --> 00:12:32,677
Like, it's really good at that kind of stuff.

230
00:12:33,558 --> 00:12:37,080
So, and if you don't want to care about rendering, you don't have to.

231
00:12:37,160 --> 00:12:39,922
You can ignore rendering entirely.

232
00:12:40,482 --> 00:12:42,844
Like, you don't have to do anything when it comes to the rendering side.

233
00:12:43,044 --> 00:12:44,225
Or you can, and it's fine.

234
00:12:44,625 --> 00:12:47,106
Okay, there's SFML, there's other things.

235
00:12:47,987 --> 00:12:49,048
I'll mention this as well.

236
00:12:49,648 --> 00:12:52,391
I actually removed the slide on this, but I feel like it's important enough to mention it.

237
00:12:53,372 --> 00:12:56,776
If you're going 3D, there's also something called Ogre 3D.

238
00:12:57,497 --> 00:13:04,404
So that is, that's a weird one, because that walks the line between like, is it a framework or is it an engine?

239
00:13:05,125 --> 00:13:06,486
And I don't know, it's somewhere in between.

240
00:13:07,287 --> 00:13:09,610
But it's again, open source, you can do what you want with it.

241
00:13:11,218 --> 00:13:14,939
Physics, if your game uses physics, there's things like Box2D.

242
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:15,560
That's a good one.

243
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:18,561
For Tiled, you can use level editing.

244
00:13:18,941 --> 00:13:20,241
For level editing, you can use Tiled.

245
00:13:21,022 --> 00:13:23,983
And that's one of the big complaints about rolling your own tech, is there's no level editor.

246
00:13:24,483 --> 00:13:31,486
You don't have this synergy of creating an inspector with an editor and all that stuff.

247
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,286
And Tiled solves these problems.

248
00:13:33,866 --> 00:13:35,987
Tiled is an awesome little tool.

249
00:13:38,229 --> 00:13:39,891
game objects, tiles, whatever you want around.

250
00:13:39,931 --> 00:13:45,521
Again, it's a 2D thing, so it's for 2D stuff, but it works quite well and they have custom nodes and things like that.

251
00:13:45,641 --> 00:13:48,886
It exports to an XML format that's well understood and well documented.

252
00:13:49,147 --> 00:13:52,032
You need somebody to read XML, so you've got TinyXML, so that's good.

253
00:13:53,347 --> 00:13:53,547
of C++.

254
00:14:15,163 --> 00:14:22,928
But I also recognize that it's not a language that one wants to learn or use, because it's not an easy language, and it keeps growing.

255
00:14:23,408 --> 00:14:24,709
So maybe you want to use something else.

256
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:32,653
There's a talk, right, that was about integrating C Sharp into your thing, which I just saw yesterday as I was looking through what talks I wanted to go to.

257
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:35,475
So that's a thing.

258
00:14:35,975 --> 00:14:38,577
I like Lua, so Sol for Lua works as well.

259
00:14:38,737 --> 00:14:41,078
I wrote my own integration, which is open source.

260
00:14:41,098 --> 00:14:42,419
You can find it on my GitHub if you want.

261
00:14:42,859 --> 00:14:44,280
There's so many libraries out there.

262
00:14:44,520 --> 00:14:53,186
There's so many things out there that you can pull in to build this, to forge this thing that we're trying to forge.

263
00:14:56,272 --> 00:14:56,512
Okay.

264
00:14:57,353 --> 00:14:58,673
You can have Hello World up.

265
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,236
Assuming technical knowledge, you can have a Hello World up in an afternoon.

266
00:15:02,336 --> 00:15:02,896
You really can.

267
00:15:03,536 --> 00:15:03,756
Right?

268
00:15:03,877 --> 00:15:09,660
You can get a Hello World with some basic just, here's a basic tick, a little window showing up.

269
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:10,721
You can get that in a couple hours.

270
00:15:11,281 --> 00:15:12,882
You can have a framework in a weekend.

271
00:15:13,562 --> 00:15:19,286
You can just get a basic framework of, you know, while true, do my game loop, that kind of stuff.

272
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:20,826
You can get that going in a weekend.

273
00:15:21,807 --> 00:15:22,868
And I think within a week,

274
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,339
probably have an entire test level.

275
00:15:27,119 --> 00:15:29,080
And I know because I did all this.

276
00:15:29,380 --> 00:15:30,520
I'm like, can I though?

277
00:15:31,101 --> 00:15:31,561
And I did.

278
00:15:31,621 --> 00:15:34,522
And I had a little, it wasn't like an amazing thing.

279
00:15:34,542 --> 00:15:35,943
I'm not going to win awards for it.

280
00:15:36,283 --> 00:15:45,847
But I had a basic test level with a little object running around with a silly little object system in a week.

281
00:15:47,447 --> 00:15:50,348
Now this is for something really, really, really simple, right?

282
00:15:50,489 --> 00:15:51,889
Again, we're not remaking Unity.

283
00:15:52,229 --> 00:15:53,750
This is for something really simple.

284
00:15:57,092 --> 00:16:01,275
So some of the advantages that we have for doing this, right?

285
00:16:01,555 --> 00:16:04,457
Well, it is generally cost effective in the long term.

286
00:16:05,318 --> 00:16:10,442
My suspicion is that nobody in this room is like making a game, and they're like, OK, cool, that was done.

287
00:16:10,482 --> 00:16:12,603
I'm going to go be a farmer for a while or something, right?

288
00:16:12,784 --> 00:16:19,849
Like, we're probably in this, especially for as crazy as us indies sort of are to have to do this, right?

289
00:16:21,510 --> 00:16:28,518
cost-effective in the long term because you're investing in your own company, in your own tech, in your own world, right?

290
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,562
You build the thing that you want and nothing else.

291
00:16:32,695 --> 00:16:33,736
So that's extremely important.

292
00:16:33,796 --> 00:16:34,777
It's extremely powerful.

293
00:16:35,457 --> 00:16:39,821
Remember in that slide minutes ago that I had with the big gradient?

294
00:16:40,361 --> 00:16:42,523
You could build that thing all the way on the right.

295
00:16:42,543 --> 00:16:46,146
You can say, OK, the type of game I'm making is this roguelike style game.

296
00:16:46,226 --> 00:16:48,287
So I'm going to use this framework.

297
00:16:48,808 --> 00:16:55,293
And then I'm going to build on top of that exactly the systems that I need that enable me to make roguelikes fairly easily.

298
00:16:55,693 --> 00:17:00,417
And again, I'm not talking about like, let's start by spending two years building an engine.

299
00:17:00,797 --> 00:17:00,997
Right?

300
00:17:01,037 --> 00:17:03,658
Teach a person to make an engine and they'll never make a game in their life.

301
00:17:04,798 --> 00:17:07,159
What you do instead, it's true, right?

302
00:17:07,299 --> 00:17:10,160
You guys who build your own tech, that's where all the laughs came from, by the way.

303
00:17:11,221 --> 00:17:11,701
Which is true.

304
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,661
So what I'm saying is you make your game.

305
00:17:14,682 --> 00:17:17,623
And you extract stuff out as necessary.

306
00:17:18,663 --> 00:17:21,524
It's probably going to be easier to build those types of games that you want to build.

307
00:17:21,564 --> 00:17:25,065
But we have a lot of disadvantages that we have to turn through.

308
00:17:25,685 --> 00:17:27,126
Yes, there's a larger upfront cost.

309
00:17:27,995 --> 00:17:28,516
Of course there is.

310
00:17:28,997 --> 00:17:30,080
You're building your own tech.

311
00:17:30,661 --> 00:17:33,367
There is a much, much bigger upfront cost.

312
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:36,170
There's no automatic knowledge.

313
00:17:36,310 --> 00:17:44,996
And this one's interesting because I didn't quite get it until I, in my own little indie studio, I started having to, like, hire people and bring people on board.

314
00:17:45,036 --> 00:17:47,137
And I'm like, oh, right.

315
00:17:47,378 --> 00:17:52,121
They don't know how my GameObject system works because it's a weird GameObject ECS hybrid.

316
00:17:53,021 --> 00:17:57,925
Ah, I must now write documentation, the bane of all programming existence.

317
00:17:59,847 --> 00:18:18,161
The thing that made it work is I did have, I mean, the code is well commented because I'm not a monster, and we had relatively decent documentation for things, but I'm like, oh, shit, I'm gonna have to spend a week, build a bunch of documentation, onboarding, because this programmer has no, like, they'll just walk in, like, okay, I guess it compiles, now what?

318
00:18:20,023 --> 00:18:21,444
So that was something, right?

319
00:18:21,464 --> 00:18:23,866
There's no, not that automatic knowledge of bringing somebody in.

320
00:18:24,813 --> 00:18:27,316
You also often require C++ knowledge.

321
00:18:27,576 --> 00:18:42,151
Even if you don't actually require somebody to write C++, it probably requires the low-level knowledge of understanding, you know, how, like, Unity has put in a lot of time, for example, to hopefully make sure that Unity never or rarely crashes.

322
00:18:42,892 --> 00:18:58,885
which, of mixed success, but still, if C Sharp explodes, they throw an exception and catch it in the, and catch it up, and you just get a spam of a bunch of exceptions, which is better than what happens if that happens in Unreal, because now you have a pointer deref, a null pointer dereference or something, and the entire editor explodes.

323
00:18:59,426 --> 00:19:00,587
And then you're like, what happened?

324
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:04,530
And you have 50,000 messages that go by because everything crashes.

325
00:19:06,271 --> 00:19:10,295
So, you know, there is some level of low-level knowledge that is required here.

326
00:19:12,127 --> 00:19:12,187
it

327
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,292
It had Tiled as its sort of main editor.

328
00:19:33,972 --> 00:19:35,834
And so, OK, in Unity, let's say I want to make a level.

329
00:19:35,854 --> 00:19:36,334
What am I going to do?

330
00:19:36,354 --> 00:19:40,278
I'm going to take some assets from over here, and I'm going to drop them over here, and I'm going to attach things to them.

331
00:19:40,858 --> 00:19:42,920
So what does it look like in my project?

332
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:46,323
Well, they grab some things from over here, and they toss them to Tiled.

333
00:19:46,903 --> 00:19:49,005
They ran an export script, and then they ran the game.

334
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:54,310
So the only thing was there was one little tiny extra step, and they couldn't just press Play in the UI.

335
00:19:54,350 --> 00:19:57,953
They had to just go to a different window and double click an executable.

336
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:00,794
So that was really it for content creators.

337
00:20:00,974 --> 00:20:02,595
There was not much of an issue.

338
00:20:03,755 --> 00:20:04,936
They got used to it quite quickly.

339
00:20:05,116 --> 00:20:07,797
So there is still less robust tooling.

340
00:20:07,877 --> 00:20:09,578
Unity has a crap ton of tools.

341
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:14,900
Unreal has a crap ton of tools that you would have to build if you're doing the thing or find third party versions of.

342
00:20:15,961 --> 00:20:21,723
But for a small, really simple game, I don't think you need the complexity of a full engine.

343
00:20:21,743 --> 00:20:22,984
You might not need the complexity of it.

344
00:20:23,224 --> 00:20:25,065
Do all that analysis that I just talked about.

345
00:20:27,086 --> 00:20:29,907
But I'm just one person standing up here pitching for this, right?

346
00:20:30,827 --> 00:20:31,847
Why would you listen to me?

347
00:20:34,048 --> 00:20:36,148
Here's a list of games that use their own tech.

348
00:20:36,649 --> 00:20:43,590
And I would be shocked if there was even a single person in this room who hasn't heard of at least five of these.

349
00:20:44,191 --> 00:20:46,531
Probably most of them, right?

350
00:20:46,951 --> 00:20:49,512
I just found this list quite easily just digging through.

351
00:20:49,572 --> 00:20:51,352
These are all games that use their own tech.

352
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:53,073
All of them.

353
00:20:55,557 --> 00:20:56,898
So it's definitely doable.

354
00:20:56,998 --> 00:21:02,182
And many of these games, I think, are great examples of why it's good to use your own tech.

355
00:21:03,183 --> 00:21:04,644
What am I at here?

356
00:21:04,684 --> 00:21:05,585
Okay, I'm at 20 minutes.

357
00:21:05,965 --> 00:21:06,565
That's about right.

358
00:21:06,766 --> 00:21:07,786
That's about where I expected to be.

359
00:21:08,507 --> 00:21:09,468
Because I have one final point.

360
00:21:09,928 --> 00:21:12,590
And I'm going to, in fact, step away from this and address you all.

361
00:21:13,250 --> 00:21:14,992
So that we're all engaging with each other.

362
00:21:15,012 --> 00:21:18,294
Because all of this culminates to my one final point.

363
00:21:20,416 --> 00:21:22,357
I worked in AAA for a long time.

364
00:21:23,038 --> 00:21:23,899
How many of you have worked in AAA?

365
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:25,980
okay

366
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:44,377
That's it, right?

367
00:21:44,518 --> 00:21:46,038
It feels like that sometimes.

368
00:21:46,638 --> 00:21:57,143
And again, like, okay, yes, there's a lot of innovation, a lot of creativity, but I worked on The Sims 4, and I can tell you that there are times where we got a design that came from The Sims 3 that came from The Sims 2 that came from The Sims 1.

369
00:21:57,883 --> 00:22:07,587
The relationship system is fundamentally, which I wrote on The Sims 4, is fundamentally the same as it was on The Sims 3, as it was on The Sims 2, as it was on The Sims 1, with some changes and some additions.

370
00:22:08,187 --> 00:22:13,668
So we build the thing that we know is going to work, and then we kind of innovate in this little space over here.

371
00:22:14,488 --> 00:22:20,570
And we have to, because The Sims 4 had 250 people who needed to continue to have jobs and pay their mortgage.

372
00:22:21,110 --> 00:22:24,590
In indie, that's optional.

373
00:22:24,710 --> 00:22:25,471
Sadly, right?

374
00:22:25,911 --> 00:22:26,471
It is, though.

375
00:22:26,791 --> 00:22:27,491
It's optional.

376
00:22:29,191 --> 00:22:29,471
It is.

377
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:30,992
It's sadly a little optional.

378
00:22:31,372 --> 00:22:32,872
And we all know it.

379
00:22:33,272 --> 00:22:36,713
So I left AAA.

380
00:22:38,252 --> 00:22:41,274
because I kind of got sick of working on other people's ideas, mostly.

381
00:22:42,634 --> 00:22:53,320
And when I go to GDC in a place like this, and I walk out to the Expo Hall, and I'll wander some of the big company areas, and what is Microsoft doing, and what is Epic doing, and all this stuff.

382
00:22:53,820 --> 00:23:00,084
But where I go is I go to the IndyBoost, and I have been for years now, because that's where the interesting innovation is.

383
00:23:00,144 --> 00:23:01,605
That's where the design innovation is.

384
00:23:01,645 --> 00:23:05,807
That's where the creativity that I was missing in AAA is.

385
00:23:06,107 --> 00:23:07,128
That's why I'm here.

386
00:23:07,968 --> 00:23:17,790
And so while it might be absolutely mad for me to come up here and say all this stuff, and it probably is, what we're missing is technical innovation.

387
00:23:18,050 --> 00:23:19,371
We have two engines.

388
00:23:20,251 --> 00:23:21,011
Yes, there's Godot.

389
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:21,731
Yes, there's other things.

390
00:23:21,771 --> 00:23:23,192
We basically have Unity and Unreal.

391
00:23:23,412 --> 00:23:28,213
When I talk to my AAA people, when I talk to all my friends who are still there, everyone's moving to Unreal.

392
00:23:28,473 --> 00:23:29,953
They're all moving to Unreal, which is fine.

393
00:23:30,053 --> 00:23:31,473
That's probably a reasonable thing for them to do.

394
00:23:31,754 --> 00:23:33,414
But what we're missing is technical innovation.

395
00:23:34,345 --> 00:23:50,212
because epic is doing the technical innovation unity is doing their technical innovation but they also have to be all things to everybody so they can't go too far off the beaten path so while there are some really interesting indie games that are out there now that do some interesting technical innovations that is what we are missing largely

396
00:23:50,632 --> 00:23:54,554
When you build your own tech, you can say, oh, we're going to do this really crazy thing over here.

397
00:23:55,034 --> 00:23:56,214
And that's what we're missing.

398
00:23:56,594 --> 00:23:58,255
And yes, that's utterly insane.

399
00:23:58,295 --> 00:24:05,898
That's utterly mad for me to stand up here and say to a bunch of people who put their livelihood in these engines, maybe you don't use engines.

400
00:24:06,499 --> 00:24:07,699
And yes, maybe I am mad.

401
00:24:07,979 --> 00:24:09,100
But we're all indies.

402
00:24:10,780 --> 00:24:11,421
We're all mad here.

403
00:24:12,941 --> 00:24:13,261
Thank you.

404
00:24:13,902 --> 00:24:14,402
That's my talk.

405
00:24:23,302 --> 00:24:29,706
You know what's crazy about doing, and I've been doing talks at GDC for many, many years, since 2009, pretty much every year.

406
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:41,332
And when I do run throughs of talks, they're like, like this run through of this talk was exactly, it was like 30 seconds under every time.

407
00:24:41,893 --> 00:24:45,915
And this time I'm five minutes under, which is like, okay, that's how this works.

408
00:24:46,355 --> 00:24:47,536
So we have questions though.

409
00:24:48,176 --> 00:24:48,476
Yes.

410
00:24:49,037 --> 00:24:49,237
Yes.

411
00:24:50,779 --> 00:25:03,266
Earlier you mentioned that rolling your own engine is going to have a high upfront cost but it might pay you back over the long run.

412
00:25:04,467 --> 00:25:08,990
Where do you see cost savings over using something established like Unity or Unreal?

413
00:25:09,630 --> 00:25:12,210
The cost savings happens in the simplicity of what you're trying to do.

414
00:25:12,250 --> 00:25:19,272
So if you are trying to architect your own epic solution, then there is inherent cost in terms of supporting that solution.

415
00:25:19,292 --> 00:25:22,252
That's why a lot of companies, I mean, look at CD Projekt Red.

416
00:25:22,292 --> 00:25:23,612
That's why they're going to Unreal.

417
00:25:23,953 --> 00:25:28,633
And to be fair, even though I just shit on all of that, probably that's the right choice for them, right?

418
00:25:28,753 --> 00:25:32,934
They probably should go to Unreal, because their engine was in a very sad spot.

419
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:37,515
One of the big reasons why Cyberpunk 2077 went the way it went, besides

420
00:25:38,075 --> 00:25:43,556
corporate greed in general, was because the designers were working on a moving target, right?

421
00:25:43,577 --> 00:25:48,298
The engine was continuously being built as the designers were trying to make the content for it.

422
00:25:48,598 --> 00:25:50,018
So it didn't really go well for them.

423
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:58,681
So if you're trying to do something like that, then the cost savings happen much more in the long term as opposed to in a shorter term.

424
00:25:59,141 --> 00:26:04,962
But what I'm advocating is you build your own tech, right, internally, just built upon frameworks.

425
00:26:05,002 --> 00:26:07,243
And so you built your own game object system and that kind of stuff.

426
00:26:07,663 --> 00:26:09,985
and you're extracting stuff out as you're making games.

427
00:26:10,005 --> 00:26:11,986
So that's where the cost savings tends to happen.

428
00:26:12,066 --> 00:26:13,167
It's also mostly open source.

429
00:26:13,187 --> 00:26:14,788
You're not paying a Unity licensing fee.

430
00:26:15,248 --> 00:26:15,989
But that's where it comes from.

431
00:26:16,009 --> 00:26:17,129
Does that answer your question?

432
00:26:17,550 --> 00:26:17,870
It does.

433
00:26:17,950 --> 00:26:18,630
Thank you very much.

434
00:26:18,811 --> 00:26:19,331
Yeah, you're welcome.

435
00:26:20,636 --> 00:26:48,399
hi uh... so i really enjoy your talk i thought it was really interesting because we end up using in our company unity for but we've kind of right all of our own systems on top of what unity is that and the reason that we we have to do that is almost entirely because they export or they do all the exporting to android and i was on our behalf do you have any recommendations for ways to get around that kind of thing and because like this is

436
00:26:49,360 --> 00:27:00,834
absolutely the biggest shackle towards using an engine is the fact that it exports to Xcode, which I think works in an alien language or something.

437
00:27:01,115 --> 00:27:05,240
Yeah, Xcode is special.

438
00:27:05,741 --> 00:27:07,002
I mean, it's its own thing.

439
00:27:08,895 --> 00:27:11,377
Oh man, how much do I want to, okay.

440
00:27:11,917 --> 00:27:26,387
So, I don't know why Mac ever gets software made, because it's such a, like step one is pay Apple a bunch of money, and I'm like, that's, like if I want to make a release build on PC, it's a dropdown.

441
00:27:26,467 --> 00:27:31,451
I go, okay, I'm gonna set this to release, compile, and I'm, you know, I have some data builds, but I'm basically done.

442
00:27:31,831 --> 00:27:35,433
In Mac, it's like a whole, like you sacrifice like a chicken of some kind.

443
00:27:35,794 --> 00:27:37,455
It doesn't have to be a chicken, but some kind of bird.

444
00:27:38,115 --> 00:27:55,287
and like it's it's a whole thing so um no i don't have a good answer for you and i'll be perfect i'm just gonna be perfectly honest with you if i was making a like a game that had to ship across multiple mobile devices i would probably use something like unity exactly for that reason which really sucks but

445
00:27:56,108 --> 00:27:57,689
It's a terrible, it's a terrible thing.

446
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:01,470
Because at that point, now you are going to have to dedicate somebody to handle all of those platforms.

447
00:28:01,570 --> 00:28:04,190
Though, SDL does handle some of that for you.

448
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:09,992
I don't do mobile games, so I don't, I'm not like the person to speak with authority about how well SDL works.

449
00:28:10,312 --> 00:28:11,533
I don't know if anybody else here is.

450
00:28:13,693 --> 00:28:16,454
Show of hands, anyone here using their own tech for building?

451
00:28:16,594 --> 00:28:16,874
You are?

452
00:28:17,555 --> 00:28:17,795
Great.

453
00:28:17,895 --> 00:28:18,715
Do you guys want to connect?

454
00:28:18,775 --> 00:28:20,555
Because I don't, I don't have a good answer.

455
00:28:21,116 --> 00:28:21,876
Oh, you guys work together.

456
00:28:21,976 --> 00:28:22,236
Okay.

457
00:28:25,242 --> 00:28:27,844
Well then you're fucked, I don't know what to say.

458
00:28:28,504 --> 00:28:28,804
Thank you.

459
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:33,548
Yeah, sorry, I'm not up on like mobile stuff, so I don't have a great answer for you on that one.

460
00:28:34,368 --> 00:28:40,733
Can you speak to how to convince publishers you're a safe bet even though you're writing your own tech, it's not an established engine?

461
00:28:41,713 --> 00:28:46,677
Yeah, that is a problem, which is a good question to answer.

462
00:28:47,037 --> 00:28:48,478
So how do you convince publishers?

463
00:28:49,654 --> 00:28:59,118
There are some publishers that I have seen where if you are not using an engine, it's a hard no for them because they feel like it's a risk.

464
00:28:59,638 --> 00:29:07,481
So what I have done in the past, to be fair, also full disclosure, I'm self-publishing because of issues I've had with publishers in the past.

465
00:29:10,265 --> 00:29:15,928
What I've done with publishers in terms of talking about my own tech is, one, I'm a software engineer with a bunch of experience.

466
00:29:15,948 --> 00:29:21,430
And when they see, and it's weird to pull this rank, but they're like, I've worked at EA.

467
00:29:21,470 --> 00:29:25,872
And I can pull that, even though I worked in gameplay and AI and not systems.

468
00:29:26,993 --> 00:29:30,715
They're looking for that, oh, OK, they have the technical expertise to pull this off.

469
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:35,337
And the second thing is creating some kind of basic demo that shows them,

470
00:29:36,117 --> 00:29:38,358
Here's my super solid demo.

471
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,379
And I've had good luck with that in the past.

472
00:29:40,699 --> 00:29:41,780
That is a barrier, though.

473
00:29:42,940 --> 00:29:45,722
Actually, enough that I probably should have put in the disadvantages slot, because that is a real thing.

474
00:29:46,422 --> 00:29:46,662
Thank you.

475
00:29:46,982 --> 00:29:47,183
Yeah.

476
00:29:51,004 --> 00:29:51,625
Hey, love the talk.

477
00:29:51,825 --> 00:29:52,185
Thank you.

478
00:29:52,985 --> 00:30:03,911
If you had to pick, what would be the most interesting lesson you learned from the most recent game, most recent iteration of your engine, whether it's technical or maybe design, what features you included or didn't include, anything like that?

479
00:30:04,765 --> 00:30:07,829
Oh, the most interesting thing I learned in general?

480
00:30:08,170 --> 00:30:10,593
Yeah, just from the most recent iteration of your engine.

481
00:30:11,594 --> 00:30:13,417
Jeez, good question.

482
00:30:18,463 --> 00:30:22,445
I don't, there's so much that I don't know what to choose.

483
00:30:23,726 --> 00:30:31,990
How to deal with, I would say one of the things that I've learned the very hard way is simplicity is probably what you want.

484
00:30:32,290 --> 00:30:37,413
Good code doesn't mean it's like architected in this like way with using all these design patterns, all these things pointing to each other.

485
00:30:37,713 --> 00:30:41,975
Good code is easy to refactor because probably what you're going to be doing most of your time is changing code.

486
00:30:42,435 --> 00:30:44,495
So good code is easy to refactor.

487
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:47,356
And so don't focus on the perfect.

488
00:30:47,796 --> 00:30:52,397
Focus on what works right now and the good, as long as I can pull back and refactor it.

489
00:30:52,857 --> 00:30:55,778
Performance optimization is another piece of that.

490
00:30:55,878 --> 00:31:05,040
Focus on things that are like, focus on that low level, like the really low hanging fruit, and just like those kinds of software engineering principles.

491
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:09,661
The other thing is, remember that when you're working on a project,

492
00:31:11,808 --> 00:31:12,008
the

493
00:31:30,668 --> 00:31:33,049
And I'll give you, that's actually the takeaway that I would give you.

494
00:31:33,189 --> 00:31:34,310
Spending time on some of the tools.

495
00:31:34,390 --> 00:31:36,411
I'll give you one really solid example.

496
00:31:37,751 --> 00:31:43,814
So I have a Lua integration and I have a way for me to type in any Lua thing that I want at any point and it'll just execute this code.

497
00:31:43,834 --> 00:31:47,135
And I use that to do things like dumping, you know, entity states and things like that.

498
00:31:47,595 --> 00:31:49,096
And I'm like, this is ridiculous.

499
00:31:49,736 --> 00:31:57,720
So I integrated C Sharp into, like, basically .NET as a thing into it to create a little .NET window that allows me to just

500
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,421
Here's my entity and all the components and all the data and just dump it in.

501
00:32:02,061 --> 00:32:03,802
And I'm like, so against it.

502
00:32:03,842 --> 00:32:05,122
It's gonna take me forever to do.

503
00:32:05,562 --> 00:32:06,963
It took me like two days or something.

504
00:32:07,663 --> 00:32:08,663
And I'm like, oh God.

505
00:32:08,963 --> 00:32:10,404
And do you know how much time it saved me?

506
00:32:10,884 --> 00:32:13,244
It paid for itself in like less than a month.

507
00:32:13,745 --> 00:32:19,826
So investing in tools and things like that and feeling those pain points and learning how to feel those pain points because you're the guy who's gonna solve it.

508
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:20,787
It's not the tools team.

509
00:32:20,827 --> 00:32:21,547
It's not anyone else.

510
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,007
That's probably the biggest lesson.

511
00:32:23,848 --> 00:32:24,128
Thank you.

512
00:32:24,428 --> 00:32:24,788
You're welcome.
