1
00:00:06,134 --> 00:00:12,415
Hey guys, my name is Lina Hassanov and I am an independent 3D artist from Germany.

2
00:00:12,415 --> 00:00:15,556
I hope you had a great GDC so far. It's Friday.

3
00:00:15,556 --> 00:00:22,257
And yeah, this is our panel, the resilient job hunt, addressing the well of doubts.

4
00:00:22,257 --> 00:00:27,319
Did everyone click the right link? Alright, then let's go.

5
00:00:27,319 --> 00:00:31,639
Now you might wonder why would someone like me...

6
00:00:31,639 --> 00:00:32,760
Yeah, this would be me.

7
00:00:33,447 --> 00:00:38,509
I'm going to make this panel because I actually don't have much experience in the games industry.

8
00:00:38,509 --> 00:00:42,411
And the truth is that it took me a while to graduate.

9
00:00:42,411 --> 00:00:47,293
First I finished my Bachelor of Science, then I acquired my 3D diploma.

10
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:51,955
And afterwards as I graduated, the whole pandemic started.

11
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:58,338
And to find a job in the games industry, it felt actually impossible, or at least it seemed

12
00:00:58,338 --> 00:00:59,638
this way.

13
00:01:00,262 --> 00:01:07,266
But even before that, it really sounded scary and stressful to apply, but in the end, it was so worth it.

14
00:01:07,266 --> 00:01:14,991
That's why I have put up this panel, these five amazing individuals, who do have jobs in the industry.

15
00:01:14,991 --> 00:01:21,335
They all work in different disciplines, but are connected through their passion and love for games,

16
00:01:21,335 --> 00:01:25,958
and their openness and willingness to share. So this is simply amazing.

17
00:01:25,958 --> 00:01:28,680
And I hope that you are someone who wants to...

18
00:01:29,362 --> 00:01:32,382
Take the same path as them and learn from their mistakes,

19
00:01:32,382 --> 00:01:34,683
but especially their success stories,

20
00:01:34,683 --> 00:01:38,884
because there will be a lot of those on this panel.

21
00:01:38,884 --> 00:01:40,944
And if you are someone who already

22
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:44,045
has a job in the industry, maybe you

23
00:01:44,045 --> 00:01:50,287
will feel inspired or something that they say resonates in you.

24
00:01:50,287 --> 00:01:53,808
And you maybe shared a similar experience.

25
00:01:53,808 --> 00:01:57,168
So we have prepared six relevant questions,

26
00:01:58,247 --> 00:02:02,848
every new applicant should have when facing developed doubts when it comes to applying

27
00:02:02,848 --> 00:02:10,910
into the games industry. So meanwhile, during our panel, feel free to ask questions

28
00:02:10,910 --> 00:02:17,091
in the chat on what for your favorites and so sit back and enjoy. Don't forget the questions

29
00:02:17,091 --> 00:02:21,792
and let's welcome our panelists. Hey guys, please introduce your awesome selves.

30
00:02:21,792 --> 00:02:25,273
So let's start with Carlos.

31
00:02:26,118 --> 00:02:39,349
Hello everyone. First of all, it's amazing to be here. My name is Carlos Dana. I'm originally from Argentina. Currently I live in Stockholm, Sweden. I currently work for a consulting firm called Quick AV.

32
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:50,118
And I work for several industries, game development being one of them. I have six plus years of experience as a software developer.

33
00:02:50,739 --> 00:02:58,224
And I met most of the amazing people that are joining us today through volunteering,

34
00:02:58,224 --> 00:03:03,767
like being a conference associate at GDC or being at DevCon as a volunteer.

35
00:03:03,767 --> 00:03:08,791
So it's a pleasure to be here with everyone.

36
00:03:08,791 --> 00:03:09,851
All right. And Dana?

37
00:03:11,425 --> 00:03:16,147
Hi everyone, I'm Dana Wurzburg. I'm a 3D artist with a technical background.

38
00:03:16,147 --> 00:03:21,950
Right now I'm an art lead at First Planet Games in Berlin.

39
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:29,574
It's a really nice, small, lovely studio that just started out and has its major focus on casual games.

40
00:03:30,395 --> 00:03:39,426
Yeah, a little bit about myself. I discovered my love for 3D art and games during my time when I studied programming,

41
00:03:39,426 --> 00:03:47,496
but instead of pursuing with programming, I really had to go into 3D because it's just so cool.

42
00:03:47,496 --> 00:03:49,699
At least for me.

43
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:59,087
I have been part of around five mobile games and two VR projects.

44
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:07,815
And for three years now, you can also find me on bigger game and art festivals in Europe.

45
00:04:08,516 --> 00:04:16,004
In there, I'm not only attending, but sometimes also helping as a volunteer.

46
00:04:16,004 --> 00:04:19,068
I'm also part of Women in Games.

47
00:04:19,068 --> 00:04:24,514
And if you ever come to Berlin, you will find me in several meetups in the Berlin community as well.

48
00:04:24,514 --> 00:04:25,455
Amazing. Jeremy.

49
00:04:29,269 --> 00:04:33,030
Hello, I'm Jeremy Likas, technical producer at Cryptic Studios.

50
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:36,591
I've been making games for about eight years now.

51
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:40,612
While I was in college, I worked with a bunch of indie studios,

52
00:04:40,612 --> 00:04:44,153
and then I've been working professionally for about four years.

53
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:46,914
Shipped a lot of different fun titles and a lot of really cool IPs,

54
00:04:46,914 --> 00:04:51,335
and met a lot of these exciting folks here on this panel

55
00:04:51,335 --> 00:04:55,276
at GDC through the Conference Associate Program as well,

56
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:56,237
and very excited to be here.

57
00:04:58,571 --> 00:05:02,589
All right. Sophie.

58
00:05:02,589 --> 00:05:03,614
Hi, everyone.

59
00:05:04,012 --> 00:05:09,276
My name is Sophie Mintz and I am the Community Director at Donkey Crew, which is a small team

60
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:14,481
based out of Poland, but I currently live in the US. Thanks to the pandemic, I wasn't able to move

61
00:05:14,481 --> 00:05:22,126
just yet. Recently, we shipped our title Last Oasis into Early Access in March of 2020, and we

62
00:05:22,126 --> 00:05:28,411
just shipped on to the Xbox Game Preview in March of 2021. I have about three years of industry

63
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:32,174
experience, both in PC gaming and in the VR side of things.

64
00:05:32,755 --> 00:05:39,498
and I graduated with a BFA in illustration from Ringling back in 2016. That was also the first

65
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:46,142
year I started volunteering as a commerce associate like these other lovely folks at GDC

66
00:05:46,142 --> 00:05:50,465
and yeah I'm very happy to be here. And last but not least, Tatjana.

67
00:05:52,030 --> 00:06:12,940
Hi, my name is Tatiana and following on the trend of people who studied computer science, but ended up not going into engineering. I started my career straight out of school through the Microsoft Xbox intern program into game production. I had the opportunity to work on about six AAA games over a period of over 12 years.

68
00:06:13,982 --> 00:06:18,665
My career has taken me from Seattle to Sweden and now in Los Angeles.

69
00:06:18,665 --> 00:06:31,995
And most recently, me and a small crew of other experienced developers decided to take on the brave journey of starting your own game studios, where I am running all things studio operations and production.

70
00:06:31,995 --> 00:06:34,877
Amazing. Okay, then.

71
00:06:35,504 --> 00:06:37,345
Let's move on to our questions.

72
00:06:37,345 --> 00:06:40,888
And how this will work is that we have a main question,

73
00:06:40,888 --> 00:06:44,050
and then we will ask questions around that main question.

74
00:06:44,050 --> 00:06:47,693
So the first question will be regarding the job hunt

75
00:06:47,693 --> 00:06:48,814
and career planning.

76
00:06:48,814 --> 00:06:52,477
What do you know now that you wish you knew then?

77
00:06:52,477 --> 00:06:57,501
And Sophie, when I graduated, I couldn't find a job for one

78
00:06:57,501 --> 00:06:57,961
year.

79
00:06:57,961 --> 00:07:00,683
And does that happen often to other applicants,

80
00:07:00,683 --> 00:07:02,485
and is this considered normal?

81
00:07:04,654 --> 00:07:08,916
Definitely. So like I said, I have a BFA in illustration, and

82
00:07:08,916 --> 00:07:12,957
now I do community. I was applying to art jobs for, you

83
00:07:12,957 --> 00:07:17,719
know, most of my senior year and about 10 months after I

84
00:07:17,719 --> 00:07:21,720
graduated, and I wasn't getting any interviews, I was only

85
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:24,461
getting positive feedback on my portfolio, but no one really

86
00:07:24,461 --> 00:07:26,362
wanted to hire me. And

87
00:07:27,168 --> 00:07:29,992
that was okay. Like I had the realization that you know what,

88
00:07:29,992 --> 00:07:35,158
maybe art isn't what I want to pursue anyways. So I was working

89
00:07:35,158 --> 00:07:39,363
at a very small little coffee shop in my hometown. And then I

90
00:07:39,363 --> 00:07:42,547
moved to California without a plan and

91
00:07:42,807 --> 00:07:51,921
2017 during GDC, managed to land a contract gig at Google doing customer support. That taught me a

92
00:07:51,921 --> 00:07:57,148
lot of really great soft skills and I eventually was like moving up within that contract role and

93
00:07:57,148 --> 00:07:57,469
doing.

94
00:07:58,009 --> 00:08:02,151
other components of like QA with people,

95
00:08:02,151 --> 00:08:06,594
QA-ing people, and training new customer support agents.

96
00:08:06,594 --> 00:08:09,696
And during GDC 2018, I landed an interview

97
00:08:09,696 --> 00:08:14,318
with a small VR startup, and I got the job.

98
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:18,260
And that was my foot in the door, breaking into games.

99
00:08:18,260 --> 00:08:20,721
And so I had a lot of, you know.

100
00:08:21,374 --> 00:08:26,495
weird background stuff before I actually got into the industry. And that's really normal. There's

101
00:08:26,495 --> 00:08:32,617
plenty of people within games that have decades-long careers doing something completely unrelated.

102
00:08:32,617 --> 00:08:38,058
Like, I know someone who used to be a veterinarian and now works in games.

103
00:08:38,058 --> 00:08:45,120
So, it's okay. Take your time. It's not a rush. The games industry will be here. So, if you see

104
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:49,121
something that could give you experience that you think will help you in the long term, then go for

105
00:08:49,121 --> 00:08:49,982
it. Bye.

106
00:08:50,706 --> 00:08:52,728
Don't feel bad if you're not immediately breaking in.

107
00:08:52,728 --> 00:08:57,413
Yeah, I think it's completely normal to do something else

108
00:08:57,413 --> 00:08:58,915
in the meantime.

109
00:08:58,915 --> 00:09:00,196
Yeah.

110
00:09:00,196 --> 00:09:03,740
Carlos, something that you wish you knew then,

111
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:06,243
what is the tool that helped you the most to find the job?

112
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:14,544
Yes, so for me it was LinkedIn more than anything. When I was doing my master's degree,

113
00:09:14,544 --> 00:09:22,708
one of the people in the university that focuses on basically putting people into different

114
00:09:22,708 --> 00:09:29,851
companies recommended me start working on your LinkedIn early on while you're doing your master's

115
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:36,674
degree, and so I did. So every single project I put, I worked even if it was a Game Jam project or

116
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:43,080
something completely unrelated to the game industry, I would put it on my LinkedIn and

117
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:49,226
just get there. Also, something I wish I knew back then, it was a reach out to people. There

118
00:09:49,226 --> 00:09:57,914
are a lot of people in LinkedIn willing to lend a hand. If you see someone that has a position,

119
00:09:57,914 --> 00:09:59,656
that is in a position that you are like,

120
00:10:00,156 --> 00:10:07,663
oh I would love to work on that position in this company try to reach out usually they will answer

121
00:10:07,663 --> 00:10:13,668
and if they don't at least you try. Lately I've been trying to look more into discord

122
00:10:13,668 --> 00:10:17,712
I'm not very experienced on that areas but I know a lot of

123
00:10:18,573 --> 00:10:25,758
people recommend that nowadays and I think there is only benefits. I know some Discord communities

124
00:10:25,758 --> 00:10:31,481
can be a little bit toxic but most of them I think they are very good people and also they are

125
00:10:31,481 --> 00:10:38,706
heavily moderated so those are the communities you want to be. I agree LinkedIn is a very powerful

126
00:10:38,706 --> 00:10:46,872
tool nowadays and it's definitely worth using it right. So Jeremy in your introduction

127
00:10:47,275 --> 00:10:52,105
You had a really long list of employers and you must be a true resume pro by now.

128
00:10:52,105 --> 00:10:53,888
Please share your wisdom with us.

129
00:10:54,397 --> 00:10:59,779
Yeah, I wouldn't say I'm a complete pro. I don't think you're always learning. I'm always learning

130
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:07,543
myself. I actually still take feedback and take advice and just looking at other people's resumes

131
00:11:07,543 --> 00:11:15,126
right as well. But just continuing to tailor my resume towards job descriptions instead of just

132
00:11:15,126 --> 00:11:19,948
having an overall resume. As you start building more experience, really

133
00:11:20,528 --> 00:11:24,910
tailoring your cover letters and your resumes towards the job description and the keywords

134
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:29,211
in that job description are super important. So you end up with a variety of different

135
00:11:29,211 --> 00:11:34,672
types of resumes, but you're always constantly improving it as the years go on, even as you

136
00:11:34,672 --> 00:11:40,713
end up in the industry. And when things happen and you have to dust off the resume,

137
00:11:40,713 --> 00:11:42,794
you constantly are always improving it again.

138
00:11:44,034 --> 00:11:48,556
But, you know, if you know, in regards to the question at hand, you know, having, you know,

139
00:11:48,556 --> 00:11:54,219
when I graduated, I submitted well over probably 500 applications after graduation.

140
00:11:54,219 --> 00:12:00,042
And just learning that that kind of, you know, sends your application and resume off into a

141
00:12:00,042 --> 00:12:05,444
vast sea of other resumes. And I learned really fast that, you know, building relationships and

142
00:12:05,444 --> 00:12:10,727
people at the studios you want to work at is really important. And, you know, like.

143
00:12:11,945 --> 00:12:13,585
When I see a job that interests me,

144
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:16,146
I always make sure to go out and look for somebody

145
00:12:16,146 --> 00:12:17,766
that I know at that studio.

146
00:12:17,766 --> 00:12:22,208
Referrals usually end up getting you interviews faster,

147
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:24,608
or at least guaranteeing you that at least a human being

148
00:12:24,608 --> 00:12:26,969
is gonna read your resume.

149
00:12:26,969 --> 00:12:29,330
But then, yeah, if it's one thing that I wish I knew then,

150
00:12:29,330 --> 00:12:31,090
that I wish I knew now is,

151
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,391
instead of just applying to every job I saw,

152
00:12:33,391 --> 00:12:35,932
actually taking the time and the effort

153
00:12:35,932 --> 00:12:37,872
and doing research and deep decision

154
00:12:37,872 --> 00:12:39,813
and reaching out to people at those jobs.

155
00:12:40,622 --> 00:12:41,342
Yeah, you heard him.

156
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:44,163
That's actually stellar advice.

157
00:12:44,163 --> 00:12:47,405
All right, let's move on to the next question.

158
00:12:47,405 --> 00:12:50,086
And that will be, what challenges

159
00:12:50,086 --> 00:12:52,007
did you face while networking?

160
00:12:52,007 --> 00:12:54,208
And how did you overcome them?

161
00:12:54,208 --> 00:12:58,210
So Sophie, you mentioned previously

162
00:12:58,210 --> 00:12:59,810
that Discord helped you to find a job.

163
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,112
Can you share the story with us?

164
00:13:02,112 --> 00:13:05,073
Yeah, definitely.

165
00:13:05,073 --> 00:13:07,834
So Carlos mentioned a bit about how

166
00:13:07,834 --> 00:13:09,855
he's trying to start using Discord a little bit more.

167
00:13:10,817 --> 00:13:15,299
As a community manager, Discord is my life.

168
00:13:15,299 --> 00:13:17,520
And so when I first started working as a CM,

169
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:20,321
I was invited to an industry server

170
00:13:20,321 --> 00:13:23,122
that's run by Discord community managers.

171
00:13:23,122 --> 00:13:25,423
And it's a bunch of people from different sides

172
00:13:25,423 --> 00:13:27,264
of the gaming industry.

173
00:13:27,264 --> 00:13:29,665
And it's where we all get to get to know each other

174
00:13:29,665 --> 00:13:32,506
a little bit better, see each other's work ethic

175
00:13:32,506 --> 00:13:35,407
and how we parse through issues

176
00:13:35,407 --> 00:13:37,108
and bounce ideas off of one another.

177
00:13:37,898 --> 00:13:44,224
And while I started to talk to people there and create some friendships and get close to other

178
00:13:44,224 --> 00:13:50,749
people, it was helpful because I needed to look for a job. And my current coworker was part of

179
00:13:50,749 --> 00:13:56,974
those servers and had kind of become my friend because we had started having, you know, side

180
00:13:56,974 --> 00:14:02,358
conversations about whatever. And he knew that he liked my work ethic and that I would be a good fit

181
00:14:02,358 --> 00:14:06,402
for the team. And so when I was looking for a job, he went.

182
00:14:07,629 --> 00:14:09,650
Do you just want to work for us?

183
00:14:09,650 --> 00:14:12,631
I was like, that's it?

184
00:14:12,631 --> 00:14:15,092
Like, that's, do you want me to interview?

185
00:14:15,092 --> 00:14:17,533
And he's like, no, don't worry about it.

186
00:14:17,533 --> 00:14:18,933
Do you want to come work for us?

187
00:14:18,933 --> 00:14:20,154
I was like.

188
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:26,890
Yeah, that would be great. Thanks. And now it's been over a year and a half and it's, I could not

189
00:14:26,890 --> 00:14:33,633
imagine myself happier on any other team. And it's been great. So utilizing a space like that

190
00:14:33,633 --> 00:14:39,436
is super beneficial. And there's plenty of other servers that are focused for college kids that are,

191
00:14:39,436 --> 00:14:42,598
you know, looking to start to speak to professionals within the industry.

192
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:44,759
You can find them on Discord.

193
00:14:44,759 --> 00:14:46,460
You can find them through Twitter.

194
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,601
Twitter is also a really helpful platform

195
00:14:48,601 --> 00:14:51,783
when it comes to just kind of seeing what industry people are

196
00:14:51,783 --> 00:14:55,146
like and opening conversations with them.

197
00:14:55,146 --> 00:14:58,828
So Discord and Twitter, they're great.

198
00:14:58,828 --> 00:15:01,209
Yeah, definitely, especially right now

199
00:15:01,209 --> 00:15:05,212
where most events happen online.

200
00:15:05,212 --> 00:15:07,213
So it will be definitely a challenge

201
00:15:07,213 --> 00:15:10,235
which is overcome with the help of Discord.

202
00:15:10,235 --> 00:15:12,056
Okay, Dana.

203
00:15:12,776 --> 00:15:17,657
You are in a position where you had to hire people.

204
00:15:17,657 --> 00:15:20,657
How did networking help there?

205
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:21,618
Yeah, totally.

206
00:15:21,618 --> 00:15:28,859
Not only I had to hire people, but our studio was looking,

207
00:15:28,859 --> 00:15:32,780
or is right now also again, looking for more support.

208
00:15:32,780 --> 00:15:36,080
And I am just this kind of person

209
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:38,161
who really likes to go to events,

210
00:15:38,161 --> 00:15:40,961
because for me...

211
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:56,286
I just love attending these events because you meet so many interesting people and everybody has their own story as to how they joined games and every story is so individual.

212
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:59,427
So just meeting these people is already so inspiring.

213
00:16:00,799 --> 00:16:13,595
And meeting people on events yourself that we cannot do right now just really open up opportunities.

214
00:16:15,797 --> 00:16:23,183
We still have the platforms right now, but I'm really looking forward for events being live and in person again.

215
00:16:23,183 --> 00:16:38,255
So you can, of course, find your dream job, but you can also stumble into really inspiring conversations where you just open your horizon to new adventures.

216
00:16:38,775 --> 00:16:48,843
And instead, that can help you shift your dreams to maybe a new spot of light where it was dark before.

217
00:16:48,843 --> 00:16:55,769
And suddenly you see, oh, I don't have to do this one thing that I always dreamed, but there's more opportunities.

218
00:16:55,769 --> 00:17:02,814
And maybe I don't, I do like this new opportunity much, much better than what I had imagined before.

219
00:17:02,814 --> 00:17:03,835
So just.

220
00:17:05,116 --> 00:17:13,299
going there, really talking to people, is a good way to just network as well.

221
00:17:13,299 --> 00:17:23,524
And yeah, like you mentioned, or maybe you suggested that just before the pandemic,

222
00:17:23,524 --> 00:17:28,866
I was able to find one of our team colleagues. So,

223
00:17:30,147 --> 00:17:34,230
the stories like this.

224
00:17:34,230 --> 00:17:37,672
I've just been to another event in Berlin.

225
00:17:37,672 --> 00:17:41,515
It was an art event and I was just already on a few events

226
00:17:41,515 --> 00:17:44,337
looking for our new UI animator.

227
00:17:44,337 --> 00:17:50,381
And I was just talking to a friend and just telling her

228
00:17:50,381 --> 00:17:52,082
I've been to this event and that event

229
00:17:52,082 --> 00:17:54,644
and it's just no animators anywhere.

230
00:17:54,644 --> 00:17:55,985
And then she turns around and says,

231
00:17:57,502 --> 00:18:05,345
my friend here is an animator and she's looking for a new job and it's so easy sometimes to just

232
00:18:05,345 --> 00:18:12,388
accidentally stumble upon a new opportunity right there without even sometimes without even looking

233
00:18:12,388 --> 00:18:16,309
because she was not going to this event to find a new job she was just considering.

234
00:18:17,350 --> 00:18:22,673
And all of a sudden, I was able to say something on the event,

235
00:18:22,673 --> 00:18:24,474
I was never able before, something like,

236
00:18:24,474 --> 00:18:28,676
I will hire you and it became true in the end.

237
00:18:28,676 --> 00:18:31,978
Yeah, so on the event itself, we started talking.

238
00:18:31,978 --> 00:18:35,320
I noticed really quickly that she would be an amazing fit.

239
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:39,242
Yeah, that worked out really well for you, right?

240
00:18:39,242 --> 00:18:42,004
Yeah, but speaking of events.

241
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,724
Jeremy, you were located in Wisconsin

242
00:18:45,724 --> 00:18:48,568
when you started your journey, right?

243
00:18:48,568 --> 00:18:51,353
Did it make things difficult when it comes to networking?

244
00:18:52,122 --> 00:19:15,700
Yeah, a little bit. You don't necessarily when you think of video game development, Milwaukee, Wisconsin, on the top of that list. And that definitely was a thought that crossed my mind. I moved to that location because of family. But after doing research, I found a good technical college where they had a game industry program where I got my programming and design degree. But I also utilize that opportunity to, you know,

245
00:19:15,800 --> 00:19:20,247
branch out into areas where there was more of a game development community,

246
00:19:20,247 --> 00:19:26,637
like Madison, Wisconsin, and Chicago, which wasn't too far of a drive.

247
00:19:26,637 --> 00:19:29,322
Madison having Raven and PUBG and Epic and Bethesda.

248
00:19:30,003 --> 00:19:33,805
Chicago has EA and Jackbox and Volition and Iron Galaxy.

249
00:19:33,805 --> 00:19:36,447
And so there's definitely gaming communities in there,

250
00:19:36,447 --> 00:19:37,447
not so much in Milwaukee.

251
00:19:37,447 --> 00:19:40,569
But so, you know, it just was a lot of doing my research

252
00:19:40,569 --> 00:19:42,471
and homework and getting involved in the local community

253
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:45,653
as much as possible in any events that I could attend.

254
00:19:45,653 --> 00:19:50,255
But then also setting up and starting up my own indie event

255
00:19:50,255 --> 00:19:52,677
with a local business in the Milwaukee area

256
00:19:52,677 --> 00:19:54,918
where I invited other indie developers in the area

257
00:19:54,918 --> 00:19:56,119
to come show off their games.

258
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:04,783
That really helped with a lot of the challenges of networking in my area.

259
00:20:04,783 --> 00:20:10,146
I even went as far as showing off one of our indie games in Indianapolis and Gen Con,

260
00:20:10,146 --> 00:20:13,348
driving all the way to Indianapolis from Wisconsin.

261
00:20:14,109 --> 00:20:23,113
But yeah, and then just kind of going through all that I was bartending my way through college and with all my previous experience and life in the military and

262
00:20:23,113 --> 00:20:31,636
just utilizing all that soft skills in my non gaming job and kind of taking that into all these events that I was going in.

263
00:20:31,636 --> 00:20:38,759
And then eventually that led me to getting accepted at the conference associate program at GDC and the rest is history.

264
00:20:39,629 --> 00:20:50,917
Yeah, right. So when the event didn't come to you, you came to the event, and then at some point, you just made an event yourself. That's really cool.

265
00:20:50,917 --> 00:21:04,006
Yeah, but I would like to move on to the next question. And that would be, what does your company expect from employees that just graduated from college? You know, you just start out and you're nervous.

266
00:21:04,006 --> 00:21:04,626
Yeah, Tatiana.

267
00:21:05,201 --> 00:21:10,603
You have now worked in a AAA company and founded your own indie studio.

268
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:17,906
Is there a difference between what the AAA company expects of you versus the indie studio?

269
00:21:17,906 --> 00:21:21,948
So I came straight out of college into the industry,

270
00:21:21,948 --> 00:21:24,008
and I'm super grateful that I had a path in.

271
00:21:24,638 --> 00:21:28,039
And one of the first employees for the new indie studio

272
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:30,059
was an intern at Electronic Arts.

273
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:33,460
So I have this strong desire to make sure

274
00:21:33,460 --> 00:21:36,021
that there is a good path for people

275
00:21:36,021 --> 00:21:40,962
to come in because they're awesome co-workers and really

276
00:21:40,962 --> 00:21:42,502
the future of the industry.

277
00:21:42,502 --> 00:21:44,283
And so with Fuzzy Bottom, I'm constantly

278
00:21:44,283 --> 00:21:47,803
thinking about what would be the best way to bring

279
00:21:47,803 --> 00:21:50,524
new people into the company.

280
00:21:50,524 --> 00:21:52,945
I think at a very high level.

281
00:21:53,534 --> 00:21:57,115
Between AAA and Indy, there is a lot of common things

282
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:59,616
that both groups would look for.

283
00:21:59,616 --> 00:22:01,096
And somebody coming straight out of college,

284
00:22:01,096 --> 00:22:03,477
there's just a baseline of core skills.

285
00:22:03,477 --> 00:22:05,618
Like if you're a programmer, you probably need to know C++.

286
00:22:05,618 --> 00:22:08,039
For example, I went into production,

287
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:10,840
but I had a computer science degree.

288
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:14,021
And that helped me be a good producer

289
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:16,241
for small technical teams starting out.

290
00:22:16,241 --> 00:22:20,723
And I think experience working in groups is useful as well,

291
00:22:20,723 --> 00:22:21,063
because.

292
00:22:21,507 --> 00:22:28,211
games is very much a team sport. And so being able to coordinate and make decisions with others and

293
00:22:28,211 --> 00:22:36,456
bounce off ideas is really useful. But at a very, very high level, what we always look for myself

294
00:22:36,456 --> 00:22:41,219
and at Electronic Arts and all the other studios is somebody that just has really high potential

295
00:22:41,219 --> 00:22:47,943
to grow and learn and a willingness to put in that effort into learning. So we expect that anybody

296
00:22:47,943 --> 00:22:48,463
coming.

297
00:22:48,677 --> 00:22:55,420
fresh from college or university into the games industry, we expect to invest in them and that

298
00:22:55,420 --> 00:23:01,663
they don't know all of the things and that it's going to be a journey together and so there's

299
00:23:01,663 --> 00:23:07,365
already an expectation that will help you along the journey. I think one of the mistakes I personally

300
00:23:07,365 --> 00:23:14,188
made coming straight from school is I wanted to be perfect. I really wanted to get all the things

301
00:23:14,188 --> 00:23:17,610
right straight out of the gate and sometimes I just

302
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:23,198
got stuck in these rat holes where I could have just asked. And I think there's a delicate balance

303
00:23:23,198 --> 00:23:28,162
when you come out of school to do like try to figure it out yourself, but also don't be afraid

304
00:23:28,162 --> 00:23:33,567
to ask for help so that you're not stuck. These days, as like a senior member, I bounce ideas

305
00:23:33,567 --> 00:23:39,773
all the time before I dig into a problem. So that's just something to prepare for.

306
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:43,256
The main difference between Indian AAA is really

307
00:23:43,870 --> 00:23:49,561
kind of your focus. So in an indie studio we're a really small group of people and all of us

308
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:53,128
are expected to do a lot of different things outside of our core expertise.

309
00:23:53,779 --> 00:23:56,481
And I think things like culture and the processes

310
00:23:56,481 --> 00:23:58,583
would impact anybody coming in more

311
00:23:58,583 --> 00:24:01,145
just because it's so small and we're all need to be bought

312
00:24:01,145 --> 00:24:02,006
into the company success.

313
00:24:02,006 --> 00:24:04,507
So we're looking for people that are really excited

314
00:24:04,507 --> 00:24:07,970
about our mission, like the way that we approach development

315
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:10,392
and it's really bought in at that level.

316
00:24:10,392 --> 00:24:12,514
And then it's off to the races, so to say.

317
00:24:12,514 --> 00:24:15,256
And I think in AAA, it's really structured.

318
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:18,278
So even if you come from a generalist background,

319
00:24:18,278 --> 00:24:21,140
you're probably gonna get a task that's very specialized.

320
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:21,701
Like there's...

321
00:24:22,112 --> 00:24:27,916
the artists, but they focus in character art or level art or hard surface art. So your task will

322
00:24:27,916 --> 00:24:33,419
probably be more specialized and more focused, and you will get a mentor who is very good in that

323
00:24:33,419 --> 00:24:39,002
item. And some of the, and even maybe that small team around you will have more impact on your

324
00:24:39,002 --> 00:24:45,506
experience than the bigger studio, depending on how big it is. But overall, just again,

325
00:24:45,506 --> 00:24:50,169
that kind of hunger to learn, grow, and contribute to the team and the game.

326
00:24:50,623 --> 00:24:57,145
and make awesome experiences for players is the common expectation from anybody jumping straight out of school.

327
00:24:57,145 --> 00:25:03,147
Absolutely, it doesn't matter if Indie or AAA, just show your motivation, right?

328
00:25:03,147 --> 00:25:10,468
And yes, speaking of motivation, Carlos, you recently started a new job.

329
00:25:10,468 --> 00:25:15,790
What would you tell someone who just had their first day at the new company?

330
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:24,218
Yeah, so what I would say is breathe, take a deep breath and relax a little bit.

331
00:25:24,218 --> 00:25:31,301
No one is expecting you to come into the office the first day and start

332
00:25:31,301 --> 00:25:36,164
raking in the code and fixing all the issues and fixing all the bugs.

333
00:25:37,545 --> 00:25:41,408
I would recommend them to just be themselves.

334
00:25:41,408 --> 00:25:45,411
They don't have to demonstrate much because

335
00:25:45,411 --> 00:25:47,773
each company has their own way of working,

336
00:25:47,773 --> 00:25:53,577
even if it is a small startup or a large company.

337
00:25:53,577 --> 00:25:57,300
I would say just that, focus on the process.

338
00:25:57,300 --> 00:25:59,962
I'm going to echo everything that Tatiana said.

339
00:25:59,962 --> 00:26:02,364
This is a team sport and your team is there to

340
00:26:02,364 --> 00:26:04,246
support you and help you out there.

341
00:26:04,926 --> 00:26:10,968
So aside from that, take a deep breath and go on.

342
00:26:10,968 --> 00:26:16,071
Like demonstrate that you're the best that you can do without

343
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:19,432
without distressing yourself, I would say.

344
00:26:19,432 --> 00:26:19,872
Right.

345
00:26:19,872 --> 00:26:24,174
Last time you told me don't be afraid to make mistakes and

346
00:26:24,174 --> 00:26:25,274
it actually truly helped me in my new job.

347
00:26:25,274 --> 00:26:27,995
So thanks for that.

348
00:26:27,995 --> 00:26:31,817
Jeremy, how can job candidates meet those expectations at

349
00:26:31,817 --> 00:26:32,597
your company?

350
00:26:33,561 --> 00:26:38,168
Um, I mean, we hire, I mean, we definitely look at a variety of

351
00:26:38,168 --> 00:26:41,753
different things. When I when we look at looking at portfolios

352
00:26:41,753 --> 00:26:44,297
that show people's work, people put in the effort to actually,

353
00:26:44,297 --> 00:26:46,300
you know, show up, show off what they're working on, whether it

354
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:47,962
be a GitHub or a website or

355
00:26:49,003 --> 00:26:54,048
LinkedIn, but love seeing candidates who put in the effort, just not in college, but also

356
00:26:54,048 --> 00:26:57,351
like try to put in some effort outside as well.

357
00:26:57,351 --> 00:27:01,515
Even if it's not just like, you know, getting some simple games either on Steam or on the,

358
00:27:01,515 --> 00:27:03,496
you know, Android store or the Apple store.

359
00:27:04,857 --> 00:27:08,880
Games are just not like global game jam projects, right?

360
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:10,581
Seeing like you're taking the extra mile

361
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:12,782
like to learn in school, but also doing stuff on the side

362
00:27:12,782 --> 00:27:16,364
goes a long way.

363
00:27:16,364 --> 00:27:20,626
And just with, you know, someone who does their homework

364
00:27:20,626 --> 00:27:23,208
into the studio and culture, into the job at hand.

365
00:27:23,988 --> 00:27:35,454
When you're interviewing candidates, you know, when a candidate asks a question that could have been easily found like on our website, you know, you can you can you can usually tell very quickly when people don't do their homework.

366
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:42,457
And a big thing for me is at least making an effort to play the games that you're applying for.

367
00:27:42,457 --> 00:27:48,380
Even if you know they're not your forte. Definitely check out the games that you're going to be working on. I always highly recommend.

368
00:27:48,913 --> 00:28:01,017
And then, yeah, another big thing for me is just someone who clearly understands the chain of command and, you know, able to answer hypothetical questions, you know, like you not necessarily always looking for the right answer.

369
00:28:01,017 --> 00:28:10,520
I'm just kind of seeing how your thought processes and where your brain goes to and kind of how you step by step go through issues and situations.

370
00:28:11,197 --> 00:28:16,219
But yeah, echoing a lot of what has already been said,

371
00:28:16,219 --> 00:28:19,620
just being yourself and showing enthusiasm

372
00:28:19,620 --> 00:28:22,221
and being optimistic about the project

373
00:28:22,221 --> 00:28:24,122
and the job description at hand.

374
00:28:24,122 --> 00:28:26,022
I mean, we just hired somebody,

375
00:28:26,022 --> 00:28:28,123
I think straight out of high school.

376
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:33,965
So it is possible to accomplish that.

377
00:28:33,965 --> 00:28:36,226
Right, so be yourself,

378
00:28:36,226 --> 00:28:38,507
but also take a look at the company

379
00:28:38,507 --> 00:28:40,028
that you're applying to, right?

380
00:28:42,220 --> 00:28:47,222
All right, the next question then.

381
00:28:47,222 --> 00:28:51,123
So I think this COVID, a lot of things changed.

382
00:28:51,123 --> 00:28:53,443
And how do you apply and interview

383
00:28:53,443 --> 00:28:55,304
for a job during COVID?

384
00:28:55,304 --> 00:28:57,324
It's not completely over yet.

385
00:28:57,324 --> 00:29:02,345
So Tatiana, you actually founded last year.

386
00:29:02,345 --> 00:29:04,646
And you were brave enough to do this

387
00:29:04,646 --> 00:29:06,606
during a global pandemic.

388
00:29:06,606 --> 00:29:09,467
How did your applicants have to prepare for the application?

389
00:29:11,420 --> 00:29:17,987
So one of the great things around having your own studio, it's not my own fuzzy,

390
00:29:17,987 --> 00:29:22,913
but it's a group of people that love, but we get to write the wrongs that

391
00:29:22,913 --> 00:29:24,895
we've experienced in other places.

392
00:29:24,895 --> 00:29:27,778
So one of the things that was really important to me, because I'm in charge

393
00:29:27,778 --> 00:29:32,283
of the hiring pipeline is that it's super easy to apply that there is as few

394
00:29:32,283 --> 00:29:33,985
hurdles to actually.

395
00:29:35,410 --> 00:29:39,413
put your name into the Fuzzy Bot pool as possible.

396
00:29:39,413 --> 00:29:44,277
So we just have an email and then people send in,

397
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:47,139
you know, their resume, hopefully in PDF format

398
00:29:47,139 --> 00:29:50,841
so that the formatting is all good on everyone's computer

399
00:29:50,841 --> 00:29:53,763
with a little short intro about, you know,

400
00:29:53,763 --> 00:29:55,605
why they're interested in the company

401
00:29:55,605 --> 00:29:59,007
or what they're looking for in this particular role.

402
00:29:59,585 --> 00:30:01,867
And a little bit of a background.

403
00:30:01,867 --> 00:30:03,768
I am not looking for cover letters.

404
00:30:03,768 --> 00:30:07,792
Again, I don't want people to do something extra.

405
00:30:07,792 --> 00:30:09,413
Your resume and your body of work

406
00:30:09,413 --> 00:30:11,535
should really speak on your behalf.

407
00:30:11,535 --> 00:30:16,079
But a little bit into the email itself of why Fuzzy Bot,

408
00:30:16,079 --> 00:30:18,481
why this role, or maybe you're just

409
00:30:18,481 --> 00:30:20,543
applying to the open requisite.

410
00:30:20,543 --> 00:30:22,484
What are you bringing to the table?

411
00:30:22,484 --> 00:30:23,705
There's something there.

412
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:27,288
And I try to reply to every single person.

413
00:30:27,288 --> 00:30:27,709
One of the.

414
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:36,161
thing that I look for is, again, we are an indie studio and we really need versatile people.

415
00:30:36,161 --> 00:30:43,403
So what is it about you that would work really well in our studio? Are you a programmer who also

416
00:30:43,403 --> 00:30:49,724
does art? Are you coming straight out of school with a great degree but you have experience running

417
00:30:49,724 --> 00:30:51,165
a really big Discord community?

418
00:30:51,585 --> 00:30:56,268
Like we're looking for any kind of things that would really help our studio fill all the roles

419
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:03,834
with a small team. I would say the big difference from my experience on the AAA side is even for me

420
00:31:03,834 --> 00:31:08,598
as a person with over a decade of experience, sometimes the application process can feel

421
00:31:08,598 --> 00:31:10,019
a little bit like a black box.

422
00:31:10,349 --> 00:31:15,132
I've searched for different jobs, I've applied, I had an experience where I applied to a role,

423
00:31:15,132 --> 00:31:19,955
didn't hear back, and then like a month later a recruiter from that role reached out to me

424
00:31:19,955 --> 00:31:25,078
and asked, you know, like, hey your profile's great, do you want to apply? And I'm like, but I did,

425
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:30,801
I did, what happened? Where did my application go? And I think my advice around that is

426
00:31:31,747 --> 00:31:33,387
Try to connect to somebody in the studio,

427
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:35,128
especially in your discipline,

428
00:31:35,128 --> 00:31:38,030
because that person can give you great feedback.

429
00:31:38,030 --> 00:31:39,931
You know, if you don't have everything

430
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:41,572
that that studio needs as a programmer,

431
00:31:41,572 --> 00:31:42,992
reaching out to a senior programmer,

432
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:45,234
you can get feedback on what skills

433
00:31:45,234 --> 00:31:46,434
you might need to work on

434
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,355
before you're ready to move forward.

435
00:31:48,355 --> 00:31:50,036
And if you keep following up with them,

436
00:31:50,036 --> 00:31:51,377
you can build a relationship

437
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:53,538
and they can help recommend you

438
00:31:53,538 --> 00:31:54,719
next time things open up.

439
00:31:54,719 --> 00:31:57,280
And in big studios, things open up all the time.

440
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,841
So even if it's not this particular role,

441
00:31:59,841 --> 00:32:01,322
but you really want to join a studio.

442
00:32:01,675 --> 00:32:04,196
You can keep the conversation going.

443
00:32:04,196 --> 00:32:08,417
And even for fuzzy bot and triple a, I think.

444
00:32:08,417 --> 00:32:11,798
Seeing people who show interest, uh, and maybe ask for feedback and

445
00:32:11,798 --> 00:32:16,839
then you give them feedback and they come back in like two, three

446
00:32:16,839 --> 00:32:21,200
months showing progress, like, uh, you know, Hey, we use unreal.

447
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:24,341
I see you don't have unreal experience and that's really important to us.

448
00:32:24,341 --> 00:32:28,602
And then somebody is like, Hey, I've spent 16 weeks learning on real.

449
00:32:28,602 --> 00:32:30,222
Here's some cool stuff.

450
00:32:30,222 --> 00:32:30,342
Like.

451
00:32:30,815 --> 00:32:32,756
feel really passionate about this opportunity,

452
00:32:32,756 --> 00:32:34,056
you know, what else?

453
00:32:34,056 --> 00:32:35,797
Like that's really impressive.

454
00:32:35,797 --> 00:32:39,218
And that's something that goes from just, you know,

455
00:32:39,218 --> 00:32:40,978
one of many applicants to somebody who,

456
00:32:40,978 --> 00:32:43,119
hey, I really want to try to make this work.

457
00:32:43,119 --> 00:32:44,299
This person's really trying.

458
00:32:44,299 --> 00:32:48,040
So that's kind of been my experience.

459
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:51,281
I'm really happy to be able to streamline the things

460
00:32:51,281 --> 00:32:53,782
with Fuzzybot that I had less control over

461
00:32:53,782 --> 00:32:54,862
at the previous videos.

462
00:32:54,862 --> 00:33:00,004
So to summarize, don't spend too much.

463
00:33:00,454 --> 00:33:04,897
time on the cover letter, better let your work speak for yourself. And just keep it up.

464
00:33:04,897 --> 00:33:15,004
Don't stop after one application. Keep working. Right. Dana, how about you? Is there a difference

465
00:33:15,004 --> 00:33:19,006
between what companies expected from employees before and after Corona?

466
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:31,109
So what stays the same is basically everything that Tatjana just said and recommended.

467
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:38,272
But something that does change right now is how we work.

468
00:33:38,272 --> 00:33:44,575
Since Corona, most of our team is working online.

469
00:33:44,575 --> 00:33:49,096
So what does it mean for the interview process?

470
00:33:49,096 --> 00:33:49,216
So...

471
00:33:51,217 --> 00:33:57,203
We will probably have the normal interview that we would normally have,

472
00:33:57,203 --> 00:34:09,936
so a screening interview, but what then changed is basically that we will not have an office tour,

473
00:34:09,936 --> 00:34:14,321
unfortunately, we will do all our interviews online.

474
00:34:15,021 --> 00:34:17,964
And what happens after that?

475
00:34:17,964 --> 00:34:24,969
So how can I actually imagine working from home?

476
00:34:24,969 --> 00:34:26,650
How does this even work?

477
00:34:26,650 --> 00:34:32,335
So we weren't really sure how that works before Corona.

478
00:34:33,236 --> 00:34:34,677
we did make it work.

479
00:34:34,677 --> 00:34:40,461
And so something that is always really important

480
00:34:40,461 --> 00:34:43,663
within game teams is that we have a constant feedback.

481
00:34:43,663 --> 00:34:46,685
Normally we would walk around a desk

482
00:34:46,685 --> 00:34:50,928
and then just casually start walking, so talking.

483
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:58,196
But what we do now is we try to simulate this artificially.

484
00:34:58,196 --> 00:35:03,462
And I think now certain things became much better than we did before.

485
00:35:03,462 --> 00:35:08,668
So we know how to poke people better.

486
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:09,268
We have artificial...

487
00:35:11,791 --> 00:35:17,218
coffee chats where we have like literally just a meeting in the middle of the day where everyone

488
00:35:17,218 --> 00:35:25,067
can come in just to talk about random stuff around the day or what they have been doing

489
00:35:25,067 --> 00:35:31,234
during the weekend because this is something important that is just missing this everyday

490
00:35:31,234 --> 00:35:31,995
interaction, right?

491
00:35:32,455 --> 00:35:41,159
So something else that we started doing is there's this amazing tool online for whiteboards.

492
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:45,581
It's called Miro, and we have become super creative with that.

493
00:35:45,581 --> 00:35:47,521
So since we do not have to...

494
00:35:48,002 --> 00:35:55,143
wipe down a whiteboard in the meeting room, we now have these really big and interesting and

495
00:35:55,143 --> 00:36:01,925
really sometimes people can scribble in silly things there. We have these really versatile

496
00:36:01,925 --> 00:36:09,087
tools now that we're definitely going to keep using after Corona is done.

497
00:36:09,507 --> 00:36:13,047
And the most important thing that really helped us,

498
00:36:13,047 --> 00:36:16,508
that Corona really helped us in our studio,

499
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:19,349
what multiple studios do right now,

500
00:36:19,349 --> 00:36:23,090
is we have more flexible work hours.

501
00:36:23,090 --> 00:36:25,110
So how does that look like now?

502
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:28,931
So obviously we all work from home,

503
00:36:28,931 --> 00:36:34,472
but in the future we definitely consider having,

504
00:36:34,472 --> 00:36:36,853
for people who want to work in the office,

505
00:36:36,853 --> 00:36:39,173
sometimes work in the office, sometimes work from home.

506
00:36:39,614 --> 00:36:45,659
We do have now an expansion, like I mentioned before, we were hiring,

507
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:52,205
so we have a small office in Berlin that is for up to 15 people,

508
00:36:52,205 --> 00:36:57,850
but we hired so many people now, 25 I believe was the last count.

509
00:36:57,850 --> 00:36:59,611
We do not even fit in this office anymore.

510
00:37:00,192 --> 00:37:11,520
And with that, working from remote, it also expanded our way of working,

511
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:18,165
not that we all work in the same location, but we also have different locations.

512
00:37:18,165 --> 00:37:23,649
So we have people working with us from different cities inside Germany,

513
00:37:23,649 --> 00:37:26,671
but also from Poland, from Romania.

514
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:33,164
And these opportunities are just really great for people right now.

515
00:37:33,164 --> 00:37:36,971
And also, I guess, after COVID is...

516
00:37:38,467 --> 00:37:45,151
history that I think more and more companies will open up these opportunities that you do not have

517
00:37:45,151 --> 00:37:56,137
to work inside an office with the people, but we have better and more ways how to work remotely

518
00:37:56,137 --> 00:38:02,782
and without missing the opportunity to casually speak and talk to each other.

519
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:08,803
Yeah, but I bet it would also help to have some working from home experience.

520
00:38:08,803 --> 00:38:10,724
But if you're not working from home,

521
00:38:10,724 --> 00:38:15,346
at least having a project aside at home and working on it.

522
00:38:15,346 --> 00:38:16,226
Right.

523
00:38:16,226 --> 00:38:21,369
So to build up the discipline that's necessary to work from home.

524
00:38:21,369 --> 00:38:25,350
Yeah, and obviously the team will also support you there if you have questions.

525
00:38:25,350 --> 00:38:27,711
That's really cool.

526
00:38:27,711 --> 00:38:28,972
Jeremy,

527
00:38:28,972 --> 00:38:29,512
so.

528
00:38:30,539 --> 00:38:35,802
for applying, how do you go about asking for a referral, especially if you don't know anyone

529
00:38:35,802 --> 00:38:41,666
at that studio that you want to apply to? Yeah, that's a great question. Something

530
00:38:41,666 --> 00:38:47,630
ideal, you know, that's gotten me all my jobs for sure. It really depends on the situation at hand.

531
00:38:47,630 --> 00:38:51,312
If I already, you know, if I don't know somebody, if I already know somebody at the studio,

532
00:38:51,312 --> 00:38:54,594
on a personal professional level, I'll usually reach out right away.

533
00:38:54,794 --> 00:38:58,575
and say, hey, you know, and I don't, you know, just start the conversation like, hey,

534
00:38:58,575 --> 00:39:03,537
give me a referral, you know, I usually start the conversation and, you know, say, hey, like,

535
00:39:03,537 --> 00:39:07,298
just so you know, I've been really interested in this position, learning, wanting to learn more

536
00:39:07,298 --> 00:39:11,619
about it and learn more about the studio, the culture, you know, do you have any insights?

537
00:39:11,619 --> 00:39:14,300
And then eventually, like, lead into that conversation, if you know,

538
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:16,340
they'd be interested in putting in a good word for me.

539
00:39:17,101 --> 00:39:21,524
If I don't know somebody, I tend to check out that studio on LinkedIn,

540
00:39:21,524 --> 00:39:26,768
check to see if there are any recruiters that I can connect with.

541
00:39:26,768 --> 00:39:29,571
But then I also go and look at my network and see,

542
00:39:29,571 --> 00:39:31,352
does anybody that I know,

543
00:39:31,352 --> 00:39:32,713
know somebody at that studio?

544
00:39:33,353 --> 00:39:36,574
This happens a lot in a lot of the social groups,

545
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:39,395
discord groups that you eventually become a part of.

546
00:39:39,395 --> 00:39:41,496
I know the conference associates do this a lot.

547
00:39:41,496 --> 00:39:44,416
They'll reach out to like on our Facebook group and say,

548
00:39:44,416 --> 00:39:46,097
hey, does anyone know anybody at Riot?

549
00:39:46,097 --> 00:39:49,638
Or does anybody know anybody at so-and-so's studio?

550
00:39:49,638 --> 00:39:52,058
And 99% of the time, they usually get,

551
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:53,359
you usually one or two people,

552
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:55,879
or sometimes more to reach out to

553
00:39:55,879 --> 00:39:57,060
with those kinds of questions.

554
00:39:58,113 --> 00:40:04,735
But most importantly, going back to what I said about getting referrals and building relationships,

555
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:09,937
it's really important. Referrals, like I said, get you interviews.

556
00:40:09,937 --> 00:40:14,739
But at some point, you'll just have to apply and submit your application,

557
00:40:14,739 --> 00:40:16,800
because you don't want to wait too long, right?

558
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:19,802
But that also doesn't mean you shouldn't follow up,

559
00:40:19,802 --> 00:40:21,784
continue to follow up with the recruiters,

560
00:40:21,784 --> 00:40:23,405
continue following up with your friends at the studios,

561
00:40:23,405 --> 00:40:28,750
because referrals can still happen even after you submitted.

562
00:40:28,750 --> 00:40:30,352
If you feel that, you know, it's been too,

563
00:40:30,352 --> 00:40:31,753
if you've waited too long to submit,

564
00:40:31,753 --> 00:40:33,675
because there is, you know,

565
00:40:33,675 --> 00:40:35,356
sometimes a short window with job openings.

566
00:40:35,356 --> 00:40:35,516
Right.

567
00:40:35,516 --> 00:40:35,636
Yeah.

568
00:40:35,636 --> 00:40:41,742
You might be surprised how many people you know

569
00:40:41,742 --> 00:40:43,423
at the studio, right?

570
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:48,824
So, okay, then I would like to move on to the next question.

571
00:40:48,824 --> 00:40:55,448
And that would be, what is the one piece of practice advice you would give someone

572
00:40:55,448 --> 00:41:02,113
who really, really wants to join the games industry?

573
00:41:02,113 --> 00:41:07,137
And yeah, Carlos, you are a person with a plan, right?

574
00:41:07,137 --> 00:41:11,680
So you moved around a lot, and would you recommend the same path to others?

575
00:41:14,537 --> 00:41:16,918
I don't know if I would recommend it.

576
00:41:16,918 --> 00:41:18,958
That's why it took a moment.

577
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:21,999
The reason why it's because it's complicated.

578
00:41:21,999 --> 00:41:23,439
You have to deal with it.

579
00:41:23,439 --> 00:41:24,900
If you move different countries, you

580
00:41:24,900 --> 00:41:27,800
have to deal with immigration, different culture.

581
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,681
Even if you move, I don't know, from the United States

582
00:41:31,681 --> 00:41:35,282
to England, it is a completely different ballgame

583
00:41:35,282 --> 00:41:37,042
because it's different culture.

584
00:41:37,042 --> 00:41:39,823
So I don't know if it is easy.

585
00:41:39,823 --> 00:41:41,623
And then if you add the language,

586
00:41:41,623 --> 00:41:43,884
then you have a completely different ballgame there

587
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:44,244
as well.

588
00:41:44,884 --> 00:41:51,206
So what I would say is that if you're curious and you want to deal with that,

589
00:41:51,206 --> 00:41:56,348
and have a good challenge and know more about the world and different people,

590
00:41:56,348 --> 00:41:57,928
I would definitely recommend it.

591
00:41:57,928 --> 00:42:03,170
That's how I got to meet several people on this panel, which I'm super happy.

592
00:42:03,170 --> 00:42:07,991
The thing I would say is that the piece of advice,

593
00:42:07,991 --> 00:42:09,372
and it's a little bit unprofessional,

594
00:42:09,372 --> 00:42:13,153
this piece of advice is that if you're planning to do this,

595
00:42:13,553 --> 00:42:19,155
look at the videos, things you should do in blank or things that you shouldn't do in blank.

596
00:42:19,155 --> 00:42:25,398
So blank being the country that you're moving because those videos tend to be very informational

597
00:42:25,398 --> 00:42:28,580
and also do your own research. That is the most important thing.

598
00:42:30,100 --> 00:42:35,123
Right, because there are a lot of opportunities where you have to move from another country.

599
00:42:35,123 --> 00:42:39,605
There is a lot of opportunities to mess things up and offend people.

600
00:42:39,605 --> 00:42:44,407
You want to be honest and straightforward about things.

601
00:42:44,407 --> 00:42:54,551
You are always letting yourself mess some stuff up, but also learn from your mistakes, grow and ask for an apology.

602
00:42:54,551 --> 00:42:59,893
If you feel like you mistreated someone or offended someone.

603
00:43:00,351 --> 00:43:09,974
Right. So, Dana, what is something that artists who want to break into the industry should be doing regularly?

604
00:43:11,705 --> 00:43:16,248
So something that you should be doing.

605
00:43:16,248 --> 00:43:20,130
And I have to admit, I'm really bad at this myself.

606
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:22,131
But most of you are not.

607
00:43:22,131 --> 00:43:24,473
You're expert at Instagram and Twitter.

608
00:43:24,473 --> 00:43:28,975
And you should really use this to your advantage.

609
00:43:28,975 --> 00:43:35,680
Really do that because it's not only what Sophie said earlier,

610
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,581
a great opportunity to connect with people around the world.

611
00:43:38,902 --> 00:43:47,225
but it's also an opportunity where you cheer each other on and allow yourself to receive feedback.

612
00:43:47,225 --> 00:43:58,509
And what is really cool about that is that you as an artist have the opportunity to,

613
00:43:58,509 --> 00:44:05,091
with these networks, go a little bit out of your comfort zone. So I really advise you to do that

614
00:44:05,091 --> 00:44:06,071
because

615
00:44:07,486 --> 00:44:12,209
What do I mean with that? I mean, share your work in progress.

616
00:44:12,209 --> 00:44:23,335
It is really interesting to see you progress and how you go from A to this artist you are right now.

617
00:44:23,335 --> 00:44:30,579
And maybe you even share some of your interests like what Tatiana said before, different interests.

618
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:36,682
Like if you play basketball, it really shows some people you are a great team player here.

619
00:44:37,482 --> 00:44:44,184
because you know how to coordinate within a team to make this goal in the end.

620
00:44:44,184 --> 00:44:49,245
So, yeah, really go on to Twitter, share your work in progress work

621
00:44:49,245 --> 00:44:53,186
and the most amazing thing that you might not expect is

622
00:44:53,186 --> 00:44:57,947
on this journey that you are sharing with your work in progress,

623
00:44:57,947 --> 00:45:00,348
you might even inspire other artists on the way.

624
00:45:00,348 --> 00:45:05,929
Yeah, that really sounds inspiring, right?

625
00:45:05,929 --> 00:45:06,249
So,

626
00:45:07,541 --> 00:45:08,922
Get yourself out of there.

627
00:45:08,922 --> 00:45:10,462
Show your work, especially as an artist.

628
00:45:10,462 --> 00:45:12,063
Show your interest.

629
00:45:12,063 --> 00:45:12,904
Show who you are.

630
00:45:12,904 --> 00:45:15,245
Don't be afraid.

631
00:45:15,245 --> 00:45:16,605
Definitely inspiring.

632
00:45:16,605 --> 00:45:21,208
So yeah, but sometimes,

633
00:45:21,208 --> 00:45:23,329
unfortunately our industry is not perfect.

634
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:24,409
Yeah, right.

635
00:45:24,409 --> 00:45:28,771
So Sophie, sometimes it cannot be the best place ever.

636
00:45:28,771 --> 00:45:31,153
What is, what precautions can you take

637
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:34,094
to make sure you don't land in a bad company?

638
00:45:34,094 --> 00:45:35,535
How do you find red flags?

639
00:45:36,917 --> 00:45:43,300
Yeah, so something to keep in mind, especially when you're first starting to look for work and just in your job hunt in general,

640
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:51,143
especially if you're looking at companies that like you are so in love with and they're your dream place to work.

641
00:45:51,143 --> 00:45:59,967
When you're, this is such a silly saying, but when you're looking at the world through rose tinted glasses, red flags just look like flags.

642
00:45:59,967 --> 00:46:05,609
So doing your own work, like we've talked about so much in this panel already, is doing your research.

643
00:46:06,007 --> 00:46:13,689
take it upon yourself to look for news articles that might shed a bad light on the place that

644
00:46:13,689 --> 00:46:20,251
you're dying to work at. Kotaku and Polygon have done really incredible expositions on

645
00:46:20,251 --> 00:46:27,334
some pretty big name places and the behavior that has gone on within those companies that is

646
00:46:27,334 --> 00:46:34,336
pretty less than savory. And there is a lot of issues that run rampant within the games industry

647
00:46:34,336 --> 00:46:35,957
and I know this is like a very hard

648
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:41,328
topic to have to bring up, but it's something that because we're not talking about it enough,

649
00:46:41,328 --> 00:46:46,090
people aren't really being held accountable. And it continues to grow and it continues to happen.

650
00:46:46,090 --> 00:46:52,211
And with especially these, you know, new people coming into the industry, you can help change

651
00:46:52,211 --> 00:46:57,953
that by knowing that these are things that are going on and making it so that you don't

652
00:46:57,953 --> 00:47:01,434
continue that behavior or you're more willing to call out that behavior.

653
00:47:03,127 --> 00:47:08,430
So be prepared to, you know, maybe have your heart broken a little bit, because as hard as it may be

654
00:47:08,430 --> 00:47:14,894
that you find out that this place that you so badly want to work for may not be the right place

655
00:47:14,894 --> 00:47:18,996
for you. And kind of tying it back to what I was talking about with, you know, joining these

656
00:47:18,996 --> 00:47:24,499
Discord spaces, those are really great for seeing these discussions happen, because sometimes there

657
00:47:24,499 --> 00:47:29,322
may not be a large article that's written about it. And the only way that you find out about some

658
00:47:29,322 --> 00:47:32,403
of the behavior from individuals at a company is...

659
00:47:32,888 --> 00:47:36,211
from people in a Discord group or a thread on Twitter.

660
00:47:36,211 --> 00:47:39,975
But also you have to know to not take those with,

661
00:47:39,975 --> 00:47:41,196
you know, at face value.

662
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:43,598
You still have to look into it and, you know,

663
00:47:43,598 --> 00:47:46,240
find out if you can validate the information

664
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:48,122
that you're seeing.

665
00:47:48,122 --> 00:47:50,404
So, you know, look for those red flags

666
00:47:50,404 --> 00:47:53,486
because there's some really terrible stuff that happens

667
00:47:53,486 --> 00:47:55,588
within the industry from the people

668
00:47:55,588 --> 00:47:57,770
that you would call your coworkers.

669
00:47:57,770 --> 00:48:00,092
And, you know, yeah.

670
00:48:00,445 --> 00:48:04,848
And you mentioned a few great resources like Polygon and Kotaku, right?

671
00:48:04,848 --> 00:48:06,810
Yeah, thank you for that.

672
00:48:06,810 --> 00:48:12,333
All right. This is definitely something that needs to be kept in mind.

673
00:48:12,333 --> 00:48:15,315
Yeah, but let's move on to the next question.

674
00:48:15,315 --> 00:48:20,739
And that would be, how did you remain resilient during your job search?

675
00:48:20,739 --> 00:48:26,963
So on this picture here, we have Dana during her difficult times in her life.

676
00:48:27,969 --> 00:48:32,554
But hey, this is you, but you got back up again, right?

677
00:48:32,554 --> 00:48:33,915
So how did you get into the situation

678
00:48:33,915 --> 00:48:35,277
and how did you get back up?

679
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:42,740
Yeah, you can see me there looking for a job,

680
00:48:42,740 --> 00:48:47,581
kind of overworking myself and just being crushed for a moment.

681
00:48:47,581 --> 00:48:49,902
And I just really had to rest.

682
00:48:49,902 --> 00:48:52,962
But how did I get there?

683
00:48:52,962 --> 00:48:55,743
So in 2016, I was still at Bugha,

684
00:48:55,743 --> 00:49:00,584
which was for me one of the most amazing companies

685
00:49:00,584 --> 00:49:03,585
that I stumbled upon and I was lucky to be part of.

686
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:11,629
And in that year our company, so VUGA, had a really rough time.

687
00:49:11,629 --> 00:49:20,633
And so it came that one day we were all called into a big auditorium by surprise

688
00:49:20,633 --> 00:49:25,175
and we got the information that 20% of our people had to be laid off.

689
00:49:28,356 --> 00:49:35,445
And I was part of one of them, even though I worked for quite some time there.

690
00:49:35,445 --> 00:49:42,013
And this place really has grown to be a family.

691
00:49:42,013 --> 00:49:46,137
Yeah, this was really a real shocking moment for me.

692
00:49:46,137 --> 00:49:46,978
This was just...

693
00:49:48,718 --> 00:49:58,845
my second home, you could say. So yeah, luckily for me, just before that happened, I was already

694
00:49:58,845 --> 00:50:04,889
planning to have something like a sabbatical where I really wanted to expand my skills.

695
00:50:04,889 --> 00:50:06,930
I wanted to try something new.

696
00:50:07,350 --> 00:50:17,498
And with that in my head, I was really lucky to already have a plan planted into my head that I really wanted to succeed.

697
00:50:17,498 --> 00:50:23,922
The only thing that was missing was the new goal. Why was I doing this? I was not doing this for my old company, right?

698
00:50:25,083 --> 00:50:28,405
what would the new company be like?

699
00:50:28,405 --> 00:50:32,908
So one thing that I really wanted to try out was

700
00:50:32,908 --> 00:50:36,670
how would it be to become a 3D environment artist?

701
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:41,153
So I was starting to look into what does this actually mean

702
00:50:41,153 --> 00:50:43,574
to be a 3D environment artist?

703
00:50:43,574 --> 00:50:46,596
What does it mean for job-wise?

704
00:50:46,596 --> 00:50:50,318
So I was looking into job adverts.

705
00:50:50,318 --> 00:50:52,940
What would certain companies need?

706
00:50:53,840 --> 00:50:59,624
to see in a person who has this expertise.

707
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:07,469
And so I was sitting down looking at new software that I could learn.

708
00:51:07,469 --> 00:51:09,891
I trained a few more skills.

709
00:51:09,891 --> 00:51:17,696
Then after a year, this was my time frame, I really wanted to go deep into the job hunt.

710
00:51:17,696 --> 00:51:21,759
So I did that and I did not get a job in the game industry.

711
00:51:23,260 --> 00:51:27,946
I, however, got a job very close to that in media.

712
00:51:27,946 --> 00:51:34,354
And with that, I got to learn something new.

713
00:51:34,354 --> 00:51:39,860
I got to learn how to work with VR and with art installations.

714
00:51:39,860 --> 00:51:42,163
I widened my horizon.

715
00:51:42,623 --> 00:51:47,305
in ways I did not imagine at this point.

716
00:51:47,305 --> 00:51:51,186
But unfortunately, I noticed really quickly

717
00:51:51,186 --> 00:51:56,288
that this is not my home, this is not my people.

718
00:51:56,288 --> 00:51:59,509
So I decided for myself, okay,

719
00:51:59,509 --> 00:52:01,170
I was not good enough the first time.

720
00:52:01,861 --> 00:52:10,707
let's keep trying. And so I was working this 40-hour job still and I was also throwing myself

721
00:52:10,707 --> 00:52:18,293
into workshops, online schooling and whatnot. And what did that to me is what you can see here

722
00:52:18,293 --> 00:52:25,538
on this picture. And what I want to tell you with that is this is not the way to go. You should

723
00:52:25,538 --> 00:52:29,941
really rest up at some point and really grant yourself

724
00:52:31,873 --> 00:52:36,234
the time you need to be yourself, be a person.

725
00:52:36,234 --> 00:52:39,995
Yeah. After that, I did take some time.

726
00:52:39,995 --> 00:52:44,396
I actually took a whole month off and did my favorite thing.

727
00:52:44,396 --> 00:52:48,937
I went to events again in a beautiful location.

728
00:52:48,937 --> 00:52:49,997
I had some rest.

729
00:52:49,997 --> 00:52:56,079
And shortly after that, that was now two years after I was laid off.

730
00:52:56,079 --> 00:52:59,740
All of a sudden, there are three job offers waiting for me.

731
00:53:00,741 --> 00:53:04,544
And I was wondering where have they been all those times?

732
00:53:04,544 --> 00:53:09,808
I was looking for almost two years now and nothing happened.

733
00:53:09,808 --> 00:53:14,451
But something, and this is the second lesson I have to tell you, is that

734
00:53:14,451 --> 00:53:21,797
it is not always on you who has to work hard to get the job.

735
00:53:21,797 --> 00:53:26,500
Sometimes it's also the industry that happens to not look for a job right now.

736
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:34,745
but they sometimes happen to look for you and then suddenly everybody at the same time.

737
00:53:34,745 --> 00:53:40,629
So don't be hard on yourself. Take the time you need to rest.

738
00:53:40,629 --> 00:53:46,612
And yeah, sometimes it's just unfortunately a waiting game.

739
00:53:46,612 --> 00:53:50,235
Yeah, but you did it. And that's the most important thing.

740
00:53:50,235 --> 00:53:54,817
Yeah. Work hard, but also take your time to rest. Right.

741
00:53:54,817 --> 00:53:54,897
So.

742
00:53:55,887 --> 00:53:58,693
Jeremy, something similar actually happened to you, right?

743
00:53:58,693 --> 00:54:02,843
So you work at Telltale Games when the studio closed down.

744
00:54:02,843 --> 00:54:05,429
How did you stay resilient during these difficult times?

745
00:54:06,151 --> 00:54:09,693
Yeah, it was a tough time, a very similar experience.

746
00:54:09,693 --> 00:54:11,034
It was heartbreaking.

747
00:54:11,034 --> 00:54:13,916
We were one big, huge family at Telltale.

748
00:54:13,916 --> 00:54:19,100
It felt like I was being separated from my brothers and sisters, but it was kind of just

749
00:54:19,100 --> 00:54:20,981
that that helped me remain resilient.

750
00:54:20,981 --> 00:54:24,384
My Telltale family, we all banded together, we all helped each other.

751
00:54:24,384 --> 00:54:31,349
The industry at large, once news broke out, really reached out and helped support all

752
00:54:31,349 --> 00:54:35,371
that networking I had done at GDC, being a conference associate.

753
00:54:35,712 --> 00:54:39,413
all the networking I'd done at other events prior to that really paid off.

754
00:54:39,413 --> 00:54:44,094
I had people reaching out to me that were worried.

755
00:54:44,094 --> 00:54:47,115
But even though I still had all that,

756
00:54:47,115 --> 00:54:51,397
it still was a huge journey getting back into the industry.

757
00:54:51,397 --> 00:54:53,337
I was still unemployed for two months.

758
00:54:53,337 --> 00:54:56,639
I was online every day looking and applying and networking with referrals.

759
00:54:56,639 --> 00:55:01,680
But then again, somebody I knew at Telltale introduced me to somebody at

760
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,221
Warner Brothers and that's how I got the contract at Warner Brothers.

761
00:55:06,383 --> 00:55:12,846
Kryptik reached out to me from a recruiter that I actually knew years prior through Magic Leap.

762
00:55:12,846 --> 00:55:16,988
So you never know what could happen. You could be talking to somebody today that might be

763
00:55:16,988 --> 00:55:21,110
interviewing you five years from now. So just remaining above all, remain humble,

764
00:55:21,110 --> 00:55:26,473
remain positive and optimistic, and just keep building on those relationships.

765
00:55:26,473 --> 00:55:33,616
Yeah, thank you for your advice. Just always staying so humble, but you're actually amazing.

766
00:55:34,621 --> 00:55:35,242
Yeah.

767
00:55:35,242 --> 00:55:40,791
Carlos, what is your plan so that you don't end up like this photo by looking for a new

768
00:55:40,791 --> 00:55:41,712
job in the games industry?

769
00:55:43,489 --> 00:55:53,675
So it's hard because I'm usually interviewing all the time and being interviewed, interviewing and being interviewed all the time.

770
00:55:53,675 --> 00:55:58,919
So what I would say is don't try to compete with other people.

771
00:55:58,919 --> 00:56:01,400
That's a that never worked out for me.

772
00:56:01,400 --> 00:56:05,443
And I if it worked out for you, I good luck with that.

773
00:56:05,443 --> 00:56:10,946
The reason why I say this is because one time I was interviewing for a position.

774
00:56:12,047 --> 00:56:17,388
And basically, I wasn't chosen for that position.

775
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:21,610
And later, I learned that I was the second option.

776
00:56:21,610 --> 00:56:26,011
And the first option, some people handed me the CV.

777
00:56:26,011 --> 00:56:29,012
I managed to get the CV of the guy who actually

778
00:56:29,012 --> 00:56:29,752
got that position.

779
00:56:29,752 --> 00:56:30,393
And.

780
00:56:30,893 --> 00:56:36,154
really when I compared myself to that guy he was a much better fit for that position so the reason

781
00:56:36,154 --> 00:56:43,737
why I say this is like if I were to be honest he was definitely much more experienced he fitted the

782
00:56:43,737 --> 00:56:47,058
job right right away and multiple times he's not

783
00:56:48,018 --> 00:56:52,619
It's not that you weren't good enough, it's because someone was better.

784
00:56:52,619 --> 00:56:56,940
And what you have to do is not to compare yourself with other people,

785
00:56:56,940 --> 00:57:00,781
is compare yourself to who you've been yesterday.

786
00:57:00,781 --> 00:57:05,202
So if you really wanted, if I really wanted a job,

787
00:57:05,202 --> 00:57:08,663
I should have trained on those specific tools for those specific things,

788
00:57:08,663 --> 00:57:10,843
for that specific company.

789
00:57:10,843 --> 00:57:12,403
And I didn't have that skill set.

790
00:57:12,403 --> 00:57:17,265
So I was kind of in the wrong position at the time.

791
00:57:17,265 --> 00:57:17,365
So...

792
00:57:19,025 --> 00:57:23,728
So, always try to be better.

793
00:57:23,728 --> 00:57:25,969
Everybody has a different story.

794
00:57:25,969 --> 00:57:34,454
And sometimes you can try super hard and not get the results that you expected and it's all right.

795
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:35,815
I'm not saying shrug it off.

796
00:57:35,815 --> 00:57:40,157
Learn, evolve and continue moving forward.

797
00:57:40,157 --> 00:57:42,218
It's just a misstep.

798
00:57:42,218 --> 00:57:45,180
You can you will take many of those and.

799
00:57:46,020 --> 00:57:53,506
I messed up multiple times in my life and I want people to know that.

800
00:57:53,506 --> 00:58:00,051
And it's not the reason to stop, it's one more reason to continue going and learn from your

801
00:58:00,051 --> 00:58:06,976
mistakes and continue moving forward. So yeah. Absolutely. Yeah, thank you for that Carlos,

802
00:58:06,976 --> 00:58:14,261
that was actually really inspiring. Don't stop, continue, but also take care of yourself and

803
00:58:15,303 --> 00:58:17,205
Your time will come, definitely.

804
00:58:17,205 --> 00:58:19,548
Yeah, and do some exercise also helps.

805
00:58:19,548 --> 00:58:23,452
If you had a bad day, just run as fast as you can.

806
00:58:23,452 --> 00:58:25,935
Probably it will go away.

807
00:58:25,935 --> 00:58:27,556
You're right. I agree.

808
00:58:29,110 --> 00:58:30,810
Right, and this is it.

809
00:58:30,810 --> 00:58:35,512
As you can see, our panelists went through many trials

810
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,612
and still they stayed resilient.

811
00:58:37,612 --> 00:58:40,033
And I hope that you could learn a lot of them

812
00:58:40,033 --> 00:58:41,773
and get inspired by them.

813
00:58:41,773 --> 00:58:43,654
So let's summarize a little bit.

814
00:58:43,654 --> 00:58:45,695
