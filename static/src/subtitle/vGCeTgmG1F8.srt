00:00:02,887 --> 00:00:06,569
Hello, I am Toya Kristen Finley from Schneudel Media LLC,

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,771
and this is It's Not in the Writer's Manual.

3
00:00:09,771 --> 00:00:12,092
And this is a crowdsourced panel.

4
00:00:12,092 --> 00:00:15,915
So the content is based upon the questions

5
00:00:15,915 --> 00:00:18,236
that you would like to bring to us.

6
00:00:18,236 --> 00:00:20,517
And I would like to start by everybody

7
00:00:20,517 --> 00:00:22,459
giving a brief introduction of who they are

8
00:00:22,459 --> 00:00:24,080
and how they actually got into game writing.

9
00:00:27,092 --> 00:00:34,179
So I'm Chris Avalone. I got into gaming about 25 years ago because I was a pen and paper D&D game master

10
00:00:34,179 --> 00:00:37,322
because my players were really lazy so I had to make all the stories.

11
00:00:37,322 --> 00:00:42,287
And then I tried to publish those stories and eventually on the 30th submission I got accepted

12
00:00:42,287 --> 00:00:45,911
and then I turned that into an exciting career in game development

13
00:00:45,911 --> 00:00:49,794
because I could prove to somebody that someone would pay something for something that I wrote.

14
00:00:51,522 --> 00:00:58,970
I'm Heidi McDonald. I broke into the gaming industry when I was 41 years old. I was the

15
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:03,295
oldest intern that Jesse Schell ever hired. The movie The Internship, I didn't have to

16
00:01:03,295 --> 00:01:09,282
watch it because I lived it. My first project with them was an HIV prevention game and if

17
00:01:09,282 --> 00:01:12,585
you want to be thrown into the deep end, try making HIV prevention fun.

18
00:01:14,649 --> 00:01:23,177
I'm very proud of the fact that Orion Trail, our game, just got tagged for Narrative Excellence

19
00:01:23,177 --> 00:01:26,681
by the IGF this year, so that was my big happy for this year.

20
00:01:26,681 --> 00:01:27,141
So, welcome.

21
00:01:27,141 --> 00:01:27,502
Thank you.

22
00:01:30,989 --> 00:01:34,471
I'm Evan Skolnick and I've been in games for about 15 years.

23
00:01:34,471 --> 00:01:38,314
I kind of side slipped into games after having worked in comics at Marvel Comics and other

24
00:01:38,314 --> 00:01:44,319
companies and working in interactive development on CD-ROMs and websites and then eventually

25
00:01:44,319 --> 00:01:49,643
just sliding over to game development, first as a producer and then helping out occasionally

26
00:01:49,643 --> 00:01:53,046
with narrative because of my background and then bit by bit doing more and more narrative

27
00:01:53,046 --> 00:01:54,867
and less and less producing which makes me very happy.

28
00:01:57,282 --> 00:02:03,512
Hi, I'm Michelle Clough. I'll be playing the plucky newbie of the panel because I've actually only been in game

29
00:02:03,512 --> 00:02:07,018
narrative design and writing for I guess maybe two or three years.

30
00:02:07,018 --> 00:02:11,365
I got into it by actually meeting these wonderful lovely people and then getting me in touch with

31
00:02:12,326 --> 00:02:16,569
my first client, which was a visual novel game called

32
00:02:16,569 --> 00:02:18,110
1931 Scheherazade in the Library of Pergamon.

33
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:21,973
I've also been doing a little bit of the lecturing circuit. Some of you may

34
00:02:21,973 --> 00:02:26,057
remember two years ago I did a talk about male sexuality in games

35
00:02:26,057 --> 00:02:30,440
as well as how to write a healthy, diverse fan service.

36
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,844
And I'm also head of the Romance and Sexuality Special Interest Group for IGDA.

37
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:43,054
Alright, at the other end of the panel we have the other grizzled ancient of the industry here.

38
00:02:43,054 --> 00:02:49,258
I am that terrible person who is, first and foremost, was a game designer and programmer,

39
00:02:49,258 --> 00:02:51,660
and then was like, I can wrap this stuff too, watch me go.

40
00:02:52,551 --> 00:02:55,595
which usually is the nightmare of most writers and designers.

41
00:02:55,595 --> 00:02:57,357
But I was lucky in college.

42
00:02:57,357 --> 00:02:59,059
I knew a couple of other college students

43
00:02:59,059 --> 00:03:01,161
who had dropped out and started a little game company.

44
00:03:01,161 --> 00:03:02,703
And I went and offered to intern for them.

45
00:03:02,703 --> 00:03:05,106
And they gave me some programming work to do.

46
00:03:05,106 --> 00:03:07,349
And then I noticed they had a game

47
00:03:07,349 --> 00:03:08,370
they weren't going to finish.

48
00:03:09,391 --> 00:03:10,812
And I said, hey, I could finish that thing.

49
00:03:10,812 --> 00:03:12,152
And so eventually, I finished it,

50
00:03:12,152 --> 00:03:14,373
and they let me take it and go publish it somewhere else.

51
00:03:14,373 --> 00:03:16,994
And that company was Bungie Software way back

52
00:03:16,994 --> 00:03:18,275
when they were two guys in their basement.

53
00:03:18,275 --> 00:03:21,056
So that was a great introduction to the industry for me

54
00:03:21,056 --> 00:03:21,937
and game development in general.

55
00:03:21,937 --> 00:03:24,738
And I've always tried to do writing as well as game design

56
00:03:24,738 --> 00:03:25,758
when I've worked on projects.

57
00:03:25,758 --> 00:03:27,599
And a few times, I've done only writing

58
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:29,140
and then realized how little respect writers

59
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:32,301
get in the industry and went back to game design jobs.

60
00:03:32,301 --> 00:03:34,482
But now I am running an independent project

61
00:03:34,482 --> 00:03:35,003
where I'm doing.

62
00:03:35,383 --> 00:03:37,147
design writing and programming again,

63
00:03:37,147 --> 00:03:39,331
called The Church in the Darkness,

64
00:03:39,331 --> 00:03:42,718
which is gonna be done in maybe a year, if we're lucky.

65
00:03:43,922 --> 00:03:49,328
So I've been writing and publishing for many years, and about eight years ago, I wondered,

66
00:03:49,328 --> 00:03:53,573
uh, how do you get into game writing? Because I like games and I like writing, and I wonder if I

67
00:03:53,573 --> 00:03:59,459
could do that. So I actually did a Google search for game writing, which usually does not bring up

68
00:03:59,459 --> 00:04:04,445
anything, but in this case, uh, the same indie studio that Michelle started with was looking

69
00:04:04,445 --> 00:04:05,206
for lore writers.

70
00:04:05,766 --> 00:04:07,887
So I started as a lore writer, they liked what I was doing,

71
00:04:07,887 --> 00:04:09,648
they made me an assistant designer,

72
00:04:09,648 --> 00:04:11,609
and at this point in time, I discovered

73
00:04:11,609 --> 00:04:13,990
that game design was a thing.

74
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,591
So that was my start, and I've worked on probably

75
00:04:16,591 --> 00:04:20,113
about 10 projects now, PC, mobile, Facebook,

76
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,815
and probably three or four of them have actually come out,

77
00:04:22,815 --> 00:04:24,295
and the rest you will never ever see,

78
00:04:24,295 --> 00:04:25,416
but such is the game industry.

79
00:04:25,416 --> 00:04:28,337
So with that, let's start with questions.

80
00:04:28,337 --> 00:04:30,919
Please just feel free to come up.

81
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,780
We'll try to get to as many as possible.

82
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:36,125
Is this thing on?

83
00:04:36,125 --> 00:04:38,988
So as people try to break into the industry,

84
00:04:38,988 --> 00:04:43,011
sometimes it's hard to know what kind of samples

85
00:04:43,011 --> 00:04:44,532
to send when you're asked for them.

86
00:04:44,532 --> 00:04:50,296
So what kind of samples pool should we be working towards?

87
00:04:50,296 --> 00:04:52,378
Mostly in terms of form.

88
00:04:52,378 --> 00:04:56,260
Twine, short stories, screenplay format, stuff like that.

89
00:04:57,565 --> 00:04:59,807
when we do work in screenplay with these writing samples,

90
00:04:59,807 --> 00:05:03,189
is it better to follow the sort of animation screenwriting

91
00:05:03,189 --> 00:05:06,231
where you explain more than writing for live action,

92
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:10,413
things like that?

93
00:05:11,767 --> 00:05:17,208
Well, first off, I'd probably choose, when you're applying to a company, I would probably

94
00:05:17,208 --> 00:05:19,809
study what type of games they make first.

95
00:05:19,809 --> 00:05:25,611
If they actually have a game editor or a narrative tool set involved with their game design,

96
00:05:25,611 --> 00:05:30,792
open that up, figure out what format actually that tool set uses for the narrative delivery.

97
00:05:31,432 --> 00:05:34,414
And if you're actually going to include writing samples,

98
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:36,875
just tailor it for the type of game

99
00:05:36,875 --> 00:05:38,075
that those publishers usually make.

100
00:05:38,075 --> 00:05:40,096
So for example, if you're applying to Bethesda,

101
00:05:40,096 --> 00:05:42,498
I mean, study Skyrim, study Fallout 4,

102
00:05:42,498 --> 00:05:45,639
see what the dialogue mechanic flow is for that,

103
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,501
and then just tailor your submission accordingly.

104
00:05:48,501 --> 00:05:51,282
You shouldn't have to explain too much

105
00:05:51,282 --> 00:05:54,163
if you're following their general format.

106
00:05:54,163 --> 00:05:55,704
And sometimes over-explaining can actually

107
00:05:55,704 --> 00:05:57,445
hurt your case a little bit.

108
00:05:57,445 --> 00:05:59,306
But that's just one piece of advice.

109
00:06:00,704 --> 00:06:04,987
I got a really, really good piece of advice from a friend of mine who writes for BioWare

110
00:06:04,987 --> 00:06:06,388
once.

111
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:12,312
Her advice was to take a scene that has high impact in a game made by the company you want

112
00:06:12,312 --> 00:06:12,912
to apply for.

113
00:06:12,912 --> 00:06:15,954
So let's just say, you know, that you were going to apply for BioWare.

114
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:22,559
So you take your favorite scene in Mass Effect and you dissect it, dialogue line by dialogue line.

115
00:06:22,559 --> 00:06:25,902
It's going to take you a long time to have to go through all of those different times

116
00:06:25,902 --> 00:06:29,465
and find out all the different responses and where they lead.

117
00:06:29,465 --> 00:06:34,529
And you put a big string of sticky notes on your wall and you see what the structure is

118
00:06:34,529 --> 00:06:39,693
and how the mood plays out and how the dialogue plays out over the structure of that scene

119
00:06:39,693 --> 00:06:45,418
and then just adapt what you're doing to the general structure that you already saw that they used.

120
00:06:48,942 --> 00:07:01,914
I think, I guess it depends heavily on, you know, are we talking about samples for, you know, actually applying for a specific position, in which case I definitely second Chris's point of view, or whether this is stuff that we're doing.

121
00:07:02,475 --> 00:07:09,397
for a portfolio website and I think there, you know, having a diversity is really handy.

122
00:07:09,397 --> 00:07:15,199
Having said that, I got sort of my second big gig when I had nothing on there but like a couple

123
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,500
Twine games and an RPG Maker game and promised to myself that when I had time I was going to sit

124
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:23,481
down and write some combat barks and the next thing I know I get this email through the website

125
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,102
being like, hey we're looking for game writers, you know, and I'm like, okay, I'm one, I can do that.

126
00:07:28,856 --> 00:07:34,420
The other thing is I'm coming from the freelance end, so a lot of times you have non-developers.

127
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:40,884
They're new to the industry or they realize that they want to get their message out through

128
00:07:40,884 --> 00:07:45,768
a video game, and so they're not going to know to ask you for samples necessarily.

129
00:07:45,768 --> 00:07:53,273
And so in that case, I pick a few choice samples that show like character design, dialogue.

130
00:07:54,194 --> 00:08:00,440
world building, so I give them kind of a general overview, and then I send that along and say,

131
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:05,124
is there something that you need specifically? And so that will give you direction as far as

132
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:11,831
genre, tone, setting goes. So if they don't tell you, send something anyway, because you are more

133
00:08:11,831 --> 00:08:16,656
likely to get a response if you send samples, and if you don't, you may not.

134
00:08:18,404 --> 00:08:23,385
I think somewhere in there you mentioned short story.

135
00:08:23,385 --> 00:08:26,746
I would steer you away from short story or prose in general.

136
00:08:26,746 --> 00:08:30,527
If you have other samples you can show that you're writing for a visual medium because

137
00:08:30,527 --> 00:08:35,648
in nine out of ten cases or more you'll be writing for visuals and not more internal

138
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,448
focus of prose.

139
00:08:37,448 --> 00:08:42,210
So a chapter from a novel you've written or a short story might not be the best choice.

140
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:46,010
I mean if that's all you've got, we can still, when you do see one of those samples, you

141
00:08:46,010 --> 00:08:47,991
look at them and you can quickly tell within a few paragraphs.

142
00:08:48,631 --> 00:08:50,953
what kind of chops the person might have,

143
00:08:50,953 --> 00:08:53,074
but it's not the kind of writing you generally do in games,

144
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,396
so it's not as applicable as a screenplay format,

145
00:08:55,396 --> 00:08:56,817
for example.

146
00:08:56,817 --> 00:08:59,498
And in general, I agree with what everybody said.

147
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,841
I do like to see if someone does a custom sample for, say,

148
00:09:02,841 --> 00:09:05,282
fancy Studio X you're probably applying for, that's great.

149
00:09:05,282 --> 00:09:07,544
I always looked for another thing, too,

150
00:09:07,544 --> 00:09:09,365
to make sure that wasn't the only thing they had

151
00:09:09,365 --> 00:09:11,526
in their one-trick pony or something.

152
00:09:11,526 --> 00:09:13,508
But I agree that the other thing to think about

153
00:09:13,508 --> 00:09:14,869
is that the people reviewing these

154
00:09:14,869 --> 00:09:16,150
are probably reviewing a lot of them.

155
00:09:16,610 --> 00:09:21,297
So you want to have less is more, like just two or three things, like the custom piece

156
00:09:21,297 --> 00:09:21,958
and a piece of your own.

157
00:09:21,958 --> 00:09:25,803
And you want some of your own personality to come across in like that custom piece probably.

158
00:09:25,803 --> 00:09:29,708
So you can show, I can do work that fits with you, I can do my own stuff too, but it should

159
00:09:29,708 --> 00:09:30,269
be short.

160
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:33,454
It should be like, I can read it in 10 minutes or something like that.

161
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,974
I echo what Richard's saying,

162
00:09:35,974 --> 00:09:39,157
like sometimes we get like 20 page dialogue submissions

163
00:09:39,157 --> 00:09:41,779
and that's, I don't, we don't need all that

164
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,660
to determine what quality of writing you have

165
00:09:43,660 --> 00:09:46,122
or that you understand the structure of how a dialogue works

166
00:09:46,122 --> 00:09:47,563
like, and again, like Richard's right,

167
00:09:47,563 --> 00:09:49,645
like it just takes too long to read

168
00:09:49,645 --> 00:09:51,606
like a super detailed submission,

169
00:09:51,606 --> 00:09:52,947
just put your best foot forward

170
00:09:52,947 --> 00:09:55,909
and just keep it brief and condensed

171
00:09:55,909 --> 00:09:58,791
because that's also a good quality of a game writer too,

172
00:09:58,791 --> 00:10:01,954
it's like you don't need to expound upon a certain subject.

173
00:10:02,648 --> 00:10:04,910
Because you're going to have dialogue limits, right?

174
00:10:04,910 --> 00:10:07,891
And you know, always.

175
00:10:07,891 --> 00:10:12,054
When I was doing dialogue for Lionel Battle Train,

176
00:10:12,054 --> 00:10:16,136
we had to take localization into account.

177
00:10:16,136 --> 00:10:18,517
And so every single piece of dialogue

178
00:10:18,517 --> 00:10:20,818
that we had in that entire game had

179
00:10:20,818 --> 00:10:21,939
to be 110 characters long.

180
00:10:21,939 --> 00:10:27,002
So we were kind of telling our story in little spurts

181
00:10:27,002 --> 00:10:27,822
of 110 characters.

182
00:10:28,518 --> 00:10:32,750
that will actually help you learning how to do things in a very succinct manner.

183
00:10:37,445 --> 00:10:47,234
Hello. So I wouldn't claim to be a writer myself. I am a game developer, an indie game

184
00:10:47,234 --> 00:10:53,499
developer, and my friend and I are in the early stages of planning out a narrative heavy

185
00:10:53,499 --> 00:10:59,245
game, sort of choose your own adventure style experience. And...

186
00:10:59,905 --> 00:11:06,650
We want to at least make a first attempt of writing it on our own, even though neither of us are writers per se.

187
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:13,695
And I know it's a lot of work and it's going to be really tough to make it something that people connect to.

188
00:11:13,695 --> 00:11:23,122
I'm curious if you have any advice, resources for people trying to really do something that might be unique,

189
00:11:23,122 --> 00:11:27,025
but need some basic concepts of how to write good dialogue.

190
00:11:27,025 --> 00:11:27,365
And also...

191
00:11:29,506 --> 00:11:50,799
If we do feel the need later on to bring a contractor in, a writer, a game writer, what's the best format for someone to come in later on, whether, you know, to look at a rough draft or something like that and try to punch it up, what would be the best ways to work with someone like that?

192
00:11:50,799 --> 00:11:58,664
I know a bunch of people on this panel have written books. Why don't you guys, no, seriously, have written books about how to do this, so why don't you guys rattle off the title of your book?

193
00:11:59,046 --> 00:12:05,395
Yes, so I wrote the game narrative toolbox with Tobias Hosner and LeMay and Jennifer Brandes Hepler

194
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:08,599
Which is all about narrative design just the writing of it

195
00:12:08,599 --> 00:12:13,426
But also putting it into production with the entire team so you can find that on Amazon

196
00:12:15,832 --> 00:12:19,234
My book is called Game Design Theory and Practice.

197
00:12:19,234 --> 00:12:21,475
It has a chapter on writing and storytelling,

198
00:12:21,475 --> 00:12:23,356
but it's more generally about game design in total

199
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,076
and the whole development process.

200
00:12:25,076 --> 00:12:29,218
The book I wrote and came out last year

201
00:12:29,218 --> 00:12:30,759
is called Video Game Storytelling.

202
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,641
and the first half is basically a distillation of the basics of Western storytelling structure

203
00:12:37,641 --> 00:12:42,783
seen through the lens of game development. The second half is aimed at different roles on a team

204
00:12:42,783 --> 00:12:48,425
and how you can apply these principles to development. But one thing you said concerns

205
00:12:48,425 --> 00:12:53,626
me a little bit and it seems like you're associating writing with dialogue.

206
00:12:54,277 --> 00:12:56,757
Like, we're going to make the whole game and the game story,

207
00:12:56,757 --> 00:12:57,877
and then if we need, and we're going to write,

208
00:12:57,877 --> 00:12:59,178
then do you have any tips on dialogue?

209
00:12:59,178 --> 00:13:02,558
And dialogue is like the icing on the cake, right?

210
00:13:02,558 --> 00:13:05,759
The question is, how good is the cake, right?

211
00:13:05,759 --> 00:13:07,660
So you ask the question of when to bring in

212
00:13:07,660 --> 00:13:08,600
or how to bring in a writer.

213
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:11,080
And if you're not confident about your abilities

214
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,981
to tell a story, and yet you're going to structure it,

215
00:13:13,981 --> 00:13:15,922
and structure a choose-your-own-adventure story

216
00:13:15,922 --> 00:13:20,223
game, story game, the earlier, the better is my answer.

217
00:13:20,223 --> 00:13:22,443
Because if you bring a writer on just to write the dialogue,

218
00:13:22,443 --> 00:13:24,123
then you've got a structure that isn't working.

219
00:13:24,303 --> 00:13:27,905
then that writer, they will not be able to help you that much.

220
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,225
And that's a case, that happens to game writers a lot,

221
00:13:30,225 --> 00:13:34,827
is they're brought in at the late stage just to write dialogue

222
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:40,328
to layer icing on a cake that was not properly baked, possibly.

223
00:13:40,328 --> 00:13:43,669
And we can slap some icing on it, but in the end, you take a bite of it,

224
00:13:43,669 --> 00:13:45,810
and it, you know, more like a stale Twinkie sometimes.

225
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:46,530
So, yeah, that's what it is.

226
00:13:46,891 --> 00:13:51,458
So I would say the earlier the better if you're not confident in your abilities or at least

227
00:13:51,458 --> 00:13:57,328
be able to backtrack and give the writer the ability to come back in and work on your structure as well as your dialogue.

228
00:13:58,090 --> 00:13:59,950
To sort of briefly follow up on what Evan said,

229
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:01,291
like, there is a difference.

230
00:14:01,291 --> 00:14:03,051
Because at that point, in a way, you

231
00:14:03,051 --> 00:14:06,512
would be asking them, like, yes, as a game writer,

232
00:14:06,512 --> 00:14:09,772
but also to a certain extent as a copy editor who may not

233
00:14:09,772 --> 00:14:11,473
be able to make substantive changes.

234
00:14:11,473 --> 00:14:14,293
So they might be like, yes, I can do this dialogue for you,

235
00:14:14,293 --> 00:14:16,174
but here's this massive plot hole

236
00:14:16,174 --> 00:14:19,175
that would require an extra six months of development to fix.

237
00:14:20,915 --> 00:14:26,379
And the thing is, there are definitely game editors that are,

238
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,441
that is an actual discipline and is very worth looking into.

239
00:14:29,441 --> 00:14:32,623
But if you want to really integrate it with the story

240
00:14:32,623 --> 00:14:34,824
as early as possible, yeah, there's a difference

241
00:14:34,824 --> 00:14:36,765
between game editing and narrative design.

242
00:14:36,765 --> 00:14:39,006
And as Evan says, earlier the better.

243
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:43,191
Also, you were talking about hiring a writer.

244
00:14:43,191 --> 00:14:45,973
I would highly suggest doing your research on work

245
00:14:45,973 --> 00:14:48,275
for hire law and looking up work for hire contracts.

246
00:14:48,275 --> 00:14:52,018
Also, please, for the love of God and everybody in this room,

247
00:14:52,018 --> 00:14:54,780
please look up professional rates for writers.

248
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:57,803
A lot of writers do not know what professional rates are.

249
00:14:57,803 --> 00:15:00,325
And when you understand what the professional rates are

250
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:03,187
and you say, hey, I can actually pay you what you are worth

251
00:15:03,187 --> 00:15:06,589
and what your job is worth, you will get good writers.

252
00:15:06,589 --> 00:15:09,292
You will attract bad writers if you don't pay them well.

253
00:15:10,347 --> 00:15:14,969
And I guess a final thing I just wanted to say, not to be too harsh I guess, but you say like,

254
00:15:14,969 --> 00:15:19,991
oh we're not, you know, you're a programmer and maybe your friend's an artist or whatever,

255
00:15:19,991 --> 00:15:22,732
and you're like, we're going to take on this narrative game, but we don't feel like you're writers,

256
00:15:22,732 --> 00:15:25,133
why are you taking on a narrative game?

257
00:15:25,133 --> 00:15:29,314
I mean, you should play to your own strengths first, you know, if it's like a first project

258
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:33,496
that you're venturing into or something like that, you should say, well what can we do,

259
00:15:33,496 --> 00:15:35,296
what are we really good at, let's play with that.

260
00:15:35,797 --> 00:15:37,057
and then maybe write a new book.

261
00:15:37,057 --> 00:15:39,378
Or, but if you really want to do a writing game,

262
00:15:39,378 --> 00:15:41,538
a narrative game, but neither of you feel good about it,

263
00:15:41,538 --> 00:15:42,999
yeah, get someone immediately.

264
00:15:42,999 --> 00:15:45,480
And it doesn't have to be, much as I agree,

265
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:46,820
get a professional if you can,

266
00:15:46,820 --> 00:15:49,921
but if you're on a budget, look around the community

267
00:15:49,921 --> 00:15:51,001
for someone else who wants to go in

268
00:15:51,001 --> 00:15:52,302
as a partner with you or something

269
00:15:52,302 --> 00:15:55,883
who can be that voice for narrative from day one.

270
00:15:55,883 --> 00:15:57,864
Oh, just one thing, keep in mind

271
00:15:57,864 --> 00:16:01,245
that you can do a lot with narrative without words.

272
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:06,324
you can have a very visual heavy game that has a lot of environmental narrative.

273
00:16:06,324 --> 00:16:13,308
You would also need a narrative designer for that, but keep that in mind too.

274
00:16:13,308 --> 00:16:18,110
Thank you very much. I appreciate it. I wanted to avoid a lot of those pitfalls

275
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:19,591
going into it, so thank you.

276
00:16:19,591 --> 00:16:20,131
Hi.

277
00:16:20,131 --> 00:16:23,132
This might be another buy my book question, but...

278
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:29,405
I am a very strong writer and I'm not a very strong game designer and I'm trying to become,

279
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:32,566
you know, like you said, a game designer that also writes well.

280
00:16:32,566 --> 00:16:37,728
And I guess my question is how do you take it so that your writing is built around the

281
00:16:37,728 --> 00:16:39,809
mechanic more or less?

282
00:16:39,809 --> 00:16:42,449
Was that last thing you said?

283
00:16:42,449 --> 00:16:47,931
How do you suggest that you take the mechanic of the game and, you know, use your writing

284
00:16:47,931 --> 00:16:50,612
to supplement that as opposed to the other way around?

285
00:16:50,612 --> 00:16:53,593
It's just a story slapped onto a game.

286
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:56,962
I kind of came at it from the same direction that you did.

287
00:16:56,962 --> 00:17:01,966
I came into the industry as having been a writer and never done any game design before.

288
00:17:01,966 --> 00:17:06,170
And so, you know, that's kind of where I was in the same place.

289
00:17:06,170 --> 00:17:10,953
And what I did was I bought The Art of Game Design by Jesse Schell.

290
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,636
And I didn't just do that because the guy was signing my paychecks.

291
00:17:13,636 --> 00:17:19,600
It really was the most accessible, conversational, entertaining book that I found on game design.

292
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:21,902
And I learned an awful lot from that.

293
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:28,249
And you start to look at the story from different angles when you've read that book.

294
00:17:28,249 --> 00:17:33,015
And then when you're on the team that you're with and you're making this game,

295
00:17:33,015 --> 00:17:34,397
you're going to be in a lot of meetings.

296
00:17:34,397 --> 00:17:37,340
And during those meetings, they'll tell you what is and isn't possible.

297
00:17:38,134 --> 00:17:42,318
You know, if you've got this bit of dialogue, you know, about a guy who's talking

298
00:17:42,318 --> 00:17:45,882
about an ancient door that needs a key, but the artist is like, you know,

299
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,646
there's some wacky reason that it can't be a door, it's a gate.

300
00:17:49,646 --> 00:17:54,291
You know, you just, you get that by talking to the other members of your team

301
00:17:54,291 --> 00:17:57,133
and having some understanding of what their constraints are.

302
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:06,114
I'd agree with Heidi. Basically, what you'd want to do is sit down with the system designer or the gameplay programmers or whoever's actually in charge of the systems for the game,

303
00:18:06,114 --> 00:18:13,677
and just have them walk you through it. It doesn't require a lot of critical analysis to figure out what the core system, the narrative should be supporting.

304
00:18:13,677 --> 00:18:21,561
So, for example, if you're writing a merchant for an RPG, there's certain implied system mechanics there, whether people actually realize it or not.

305
00:18:21,561 --> 00:18:27,043
One is, if you're talking to a merchant, the reason a player is talking to a merchant is because they want to buy and sell something.

306
00:18:27,284 --> 00:18:31,407
So don't have like 15 nodes of dialogue before you actually get to the buy-sell option.

307
00:18:31,407 --> 00:18:35,010
You're smiling, but there are some writers that still make that mistake.

308
00:18:35,010 --> 00:18:38,113
When you talk to a merchant or you talk to the healer in town,

309
00:18:38,113 --> 00:18:41,155
there's a very specific system that you want from them.

310
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:42,836
Don't let the narrative get in the way of that.

311
00:18:42,836 --> 00:18:44,518
And that's a really easy analysis to do.

312
00:18:44,518 --> 00:18:47,721
And then you can take that analysis and make it even more complicated.

313
00:18:47,721 --> 00:18:49,802
It's like if you're in like Fallout New Vegas, for example,

314
00:18:49,802 --> 00:18:53,405
and they're trying to reinforce the reputation mechanics in that game.

315
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,757
As a narrative designer, you suddenly have an important role

316
00:18:57,757 --> 00:19:00,959
about how you're going to communicate that reputation mechanic in the game,

317
00:19:00,959 --> 00:19:04,381
which has a certain number of narrative conditionals associated with it.

318
00:19:04,381 --> 00:19:07,644
Like, you'd have to have factions, for example, in order for reputations to work.

319
00:19:07,644 --> 00:19:11,686
Or, obviously, the people you talk to need to react

320
00:19:11,686 --> 00:19:14,188
if the reputation is low or high.

321
00:19:14,188 --> 00:19:16,990
And a lot of that stuff, you can just find it by dissecting the systems,

322
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:19,592
talking to the system designer or the gameplay programmer.

323
00:19:19,972 --> 00:19:22,193
and then figuring out how the story can support all of that.

324
00:19:22,193 --> 00:19:24,173
And actually, it's actually not too complicated

325
00:19:24,173 --> 00:19:25,554
once they lay it out for you.

326
00:19:25,554 --> 00:19:28,335
There's a lot of Excel and spreadsheets involved

327
00:19:28,335 --> 00:19:29,956
with that, usually, too.

328
00:19:29,956 --> 00:19:33,317
Yeah, I've already experienced that.

329
00:19:33,317 --> 00:19:33,598
Thank you.

330
00:19:33,598 --> 00:19:38,260
This might be a dumb question, but what exactly is

331
00:19:38,260 --> 00:19:43,662
the difference between a game writer and a narrative

332
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:44,082
designer?

333
00:19:47,512 --> 00:19:55,536
So, once upon a time, the Writers Guild Association told me that we couldn't submit work because

334
00:19:55,536 --> 00:19:58,898
we weren't labeled writers where I was working.

335
00:19:59,899 --> 00:20:01,779
I took a little bit of umbrage at that.

336
00:20:01,779 --> 00:20:04,241
I'm like, well, I do a lot of writing, goddammit, blah blah blah.

337
00:20:04,241 --> 00:20:07,102
And then I realized, maybe I don't do writing.

338
00:20:07,102 --> 00:20:10,143
So I think the distinction comes...

339
00:20:10,143 --> 00:20:15,466
So a narrative designer, I think the full job description for that is

340
00:20:15,466 --> 00:20:19,568
they're the guys that also know how to script the logic variables,

341
00:20:19,568 --> 00:20:21,889
they know exactly how to implement the quests in the game

342
00:20:21,889 --> 00:20:22,849
and all those different stages,

343
00:20:22,849 --> 00:20:25,511
what sort of XP rewards they should be getting.

344
00:20:26,211 --> 00:20:29,213
usually their range is a little bit more technical than,

345
00:20:29,213 --> 00:20:33,015
hey, we just brought in a writer to take all the blank nodes

346
00:20:33,015 --> 00:20:35,096
for this particular quest and just write like two lines

347
00:20:35,096 --> 00:20:35,896
for each one of them.

348
00:20:35,896 --> 00:20:38,818
So it kind of depends.

349
00:20:38,818 --> 00:20:40,739
I generally prefer the term narrator designer

350
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,740
because as soon as you're involved

351
00:20:42,740 --> 00:20:43,821
with an interactive experience,

352
00:20:43,821 --> 00:20:46,682
I think you're doing a lot more than just writing

353
00:20:46,682 --> 00:20:49,043
whether you realize it or not, but that's just my opinion.

354
00:20:50,655 --> 00:20:56,237
The definition I've been working with for the most part has been that game writers,

355
00:20:56,237 --> 00:20:59,559
their craft focus is more on words and text.

356
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:03,881
So they're often doing the dialogue, the lore, sort of the plot,

357
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:06,862
whereas narrative design encompasses that,

358
00:21:06,862 --> 00:21:09,403
but also can encompass all the more...

359
00:21:10,004 --> 00:21:13,724
I guess abstract ways that the game itself tells story.

360
00:21:13,724 --> 00:21:17,825
You know, things like environmental design, sound design, things like that.

361
00:21:17,825 --> 00:21:20,966
So a writer would be maybe, you know, their day might be like,

362
00:21:20,966 --> 00:21:23,407
I'm going to write this, you know, this dialogue.

363
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,567
Whereas the narrative designer might be like,

364
00:21:25,567 --> 00:21:29,088
I want this area to convey a sense of foreboding.

365
00:21:29,088 --> 00:21:31,908
I'm going to go talk to, you know, the narrative designer to see how can we do that.

366
00:21:31,908 --> 00:21:34,569
Maybe we could have like a corpse hanging somewhere or something.

367
00:21:35,205 --> 00:21:37,187
That's how I differentiate it.

368
00:21:37,187 --> 00:21:38,589
I'd agree with Michelle too.

369
00:21:38,589 --> 00:21:43,254
Sometimes for games, narrative designers would actually do a visual storytelling pass.

370
00:21:43,254 --> 00:21:48,020
They're like, here's the props that I need in this area to communicate that the following thing happened.

371
00:21:48,020 --> 00:21:51,724
But there wouldn't be a single note of dialogue or a journal entry anywhere around there.

372
00:21:51,724 --> 00:21:52,365
You're just asking...

373
00:21:52,725 --> 00:21:56,129
in tandem with the environment artists and the world builders,

374
00:21:56,129 --> 00:22:00,434
like how do I build this campsite so it looks like it was abandoned one week ago

375
00:22:00,434 --> 00:22:03,858
but clearly the turrets and the binoculars are focused at this distant

376
00:22:03,858 --> 00:22:06,561
location over there that I'm trying to draw the player to

377
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:08,963
and there's no talking about it whatsoever, it's all in the setup.

378
00:22:09,397 --> 00:22:12,640
In a lot of ways, a narrative designer is a facilitator.

379
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:20,348
As Michelle was saying, the narrative design can help embody the world and the story and

380
00:22:20,348 --> 00:22:23,791
even the gameplay in a lot of different aspects of the game.

381
00:22:23,791 --> 00:22:27,876
And so as a facilitator, the narrative designer is going to work with the level designers

382
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:30,719
and the game designers and the programmers and the scripters.

383
00:22:31,279 --> 00:22:33,781
and talking to them about, okay,

384
00:22:33,781 --> 00:22:36,424
how can we get this to come across in the gameplay?

385
00:22:36,424 --> 00:22:39,626
Or, you know, how can we get aspects of the world

386
00:22:39,626 --> 00:22:42,069
to come through in the UI design?

387
00:22:42,069 --> 00:22:44,190
To use Mass Effect, for example,

388
00:22:44,190 --> 00:22:45,772
the UI in the menu settings

389
00:22:45,772 --> 00:22:47,593
looks like a console of a spaceship.

390
00:22:47,593 --> 00:22:47,894
Why?

391
00:22:47,894 --> 00:22:50,196
Because you are the commander of a spaceship.

392
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:53,639
So that's narrative design in just the UI.

393
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:56,161
You know, it can be sound, it can be art.

394
00:22:57,562 --> 00:23:00,745
So you are really making sure, I like to say it this way,

395
00:23:00,745 --> 00:23:04,989
that the world and the story embody the gameplay.

396
00:23:04,989 --> 00:23:06,251
That's how I think about it.

397
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:08,633
But you can look at any aspect of the game

398
00:23:08,633 --> 00:23:10,175
and apply narrative design to it.

399
00:23:10,175 --> 00:23:14,499
I like all the, sorry, I'm the bald white guy now.

400
00:23:14,499 --> 00:23:14,659
But.

401
00:23:17,917 --> 00:23:23,321
The sad truth is that all these things are true, but also defined differently at every

402
00:23:23,321 --> 00:23:25,624
company that you might interact with or work with.

403
00:23:25,624 --> 00:23:28,927
And some will not have narrative designers, and the writers will be doing the narrative

404
00:23:28,927 --> 00:23:30,668
design, but not getting credited as that.

405
00:23:30,668 --> 00:23:33,511
Sometimes the narrative design is being done by the level designers, and the writer's really

406
00:23:33,511 --> 00:23:34,812
artist writing the dialogue.

407
00:23:35,332 --> 00:23:37,875
Sometimes there are no writers and they're all called narrative designers.

408
00:23:37,875 --> 00:23:40,417
So it's really variable from place to place.

409
00:23:40,417 --> 00:23:43,560
I like the definitions I'm hearing, is that sort of generally what happens.

410
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:46,882
But you kind of, again, if you're applying somewhere or something like that,

411
00:23:46,882 --> 00:23:49,284
you'll want to research, well, what do they mean by this?

412
00:23:49,284 --> 00:23:50,826
And it might be that you're applying for narrative design

413
00:23:50,826 --> 00:23:52,007
and all they want to see is writing samples

414
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:53,208
and they don't even talk to you about gameplay.

415
00:23:53,208 --> 00:23:54,369
Or it might be the opposite.

416
00:23:54,729 --> 00:23:59,153
I've done a whole talk on this very subject back in the past at IGDA, and I would say

417
00:23:59,153 --> 00:24:06,178
that at a very high level, first of all, game writer, narrative designer, they both do both.

418
00:24:06,178 --> 00:24:07,319
They have to.

419
00:24:07,319 --> 00:24:08,700
It's very hard to complete.

420
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:11,923
If you're a narrative designer, you're almost guaranteed to be doing some game writing of

421
00:24:11,923 --> 00:24:12,343
some kind.

422
00:24:12,343 --> 00:24:16,246
And if you're a game writer, you're implicitly doing narrative design of some kind in the

423
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:17,447
way you think about the story.

424
00:24:18,327 --> 00:24:20,889
It's almost impossible to completely extricate them from each other.

425
00:24:20,889 --> 00:24:23,991
And in a smaller team, one person will generally be doing all.

426
00:24:23,991 --> 00:24:27,233
But as you get to a larger team, you start to see them separated.

427
00:24:27,233 --> 00:24:33,997
I would say game writer is more focused on content and the creative side,

428
00:24:33,997 --> 00:24:35,698
just the story side more.

429
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:39,640
And the narrative design is more integration and implementation.

430
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,861
But they both have to be on the same page.

431
00:24:40,861 --> 00:24:42,442
And again, they both have to be able to kind of...

432
00:24:42,882 --> 00:24:46,527
think that way, but when you get a large team, it's useful to separate them to a certain

433
00:24:46,527 --> 00:24:50,693
degree so that one person can be that person in the meetings with the level designers and

434
00:24:50,693 --> 00:24:56,160
with the system designers and the writer has the ability to detach and focus on actually

435
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:59,124
writing because it's very hard in a large team and a large project to do both those

436
00:24:59,124 --> 00:25:00,065
things at the same time.

437
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:04,962
To sort of, you know, wrap everybody's thoughts up there,

438
00:25:04,962 --> 00:25:07,185
one of the things I, one of the definitions

439
00:25:07,185 --> 00:25:09,448
I really liked for narrative design

440
00:25:09,448 --> 00:25:12,392
is that you are the champion of the story, you know,

441
00:25:12,392 --> 00:25:15,396
the champion of the theme, of the mood, of the narrative.

442
00:25:15,396 --> 00:25:18,039
And so, and of course you can be that

443
00:25:18,039 --> 00:25:19,341
as the game writer as well.

444
00:25:20,161 --> 00:25:23,983
But I think for me, narrative design, there's a connotation,

445
00:25:23,983 --> 00:25:29,286
there's a sort of an implication of not only are you championing it within the writing sphere,

446
00:25:29,286 --> 00:25:31,487
but you're championing it for the entire team.

447
00:25:31,487 --> 00:25:36,189
You're working with the team to sort of say, like, here is our narrative goal.

448
00:25:36,189 --> 00:25:39,071
How are we all working together to reach that goal?

449
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:45,585
I was just going to say that when I talk to elementary schools and they ask me what does

450
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:51,207
a narrative designer do, the simplest answer that I tell them is I'm the one who explains

451
00:25:51,207 --> 00:25:55,928
why the birds are angry.

452
00:25:55,928 --> 00:26:00,169
I just wanted, the point I wanted to make has to do with all the invisible writing that

453
00:26:00,169 --> 00:26:02,370
goes into game writing.

454
00:26:02,370 --> 00:26:05,110
Because every single thing that you see on a screen.

455
00:26:05,758 --> 00:26:09,299
has to be described so that an artist can draw it properly.

456
00:26:09,299 --> 00:26:13,260
There have to be documents that explain backstories.

457
00:26:13,260 --> 00:26:16,541
There have to be lore bibles saying,

458
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:18,861
you know, these are the rules of our world.

459
00:26:18,861 --> 00:26:22,382
So for all of the text that you see on a screen in the game,

460
00:26:22,382 --> 00:26:25,503
there's a whole lot of text that you never see,

461
00:26:25,503 --> 00:26:27,884
and we have to write all of that stuff too.

462
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:30,864
So there's a lot of invisible writing

463
00:26:30,864 --> 00:26:34,305
that goes along with the game too, so keep that in mind.

464
00:26:34,305 --> 00:26:34,725
Cool.

465
00:26:34,725 --> 00:26:35,565
Awesome, thanks so much.

466
00:26:39,248 --> 00:26:44,770
So parts of this were kind of covered by the last part of that answer of the previous question.

467
00:26:44,770 --> 00:26:52,632
But how would game writers or game narrative designers market their skills or what they do

468
00:26:52,632 --> 00:26:59,315
to people who may not be aware of what it is that game writers or game narrative designers do

469
00:26:59,315 --> 00:27:01,375
or are aware of their importance?

470
00:27:01,375 --> 00:27:03,036
Well, you point to Half-Life 1.

471
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:07,622
And you go, once upon a time, first person shooters were all just about shooting people in the face,

472
00:27:07,622 --> 00:27:13,547
but then Half-Life came along and added a story, and they saw it was valuable, it made a lot of money.

473
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:17,971
Yeah, I mean, if you're looking to convince someone of the value, is that what basically we're talking about?

474
00:27:17,971 --> 00:27:21,614
I mean, there's a survey, I have it linked on my website on the front page,

475
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:30,401
that showed that in games with a story mode, that reviewers are more concerned with

476
00:27:31,492 --> 00:27:33,674
the story aspect, the narrative aspect,

477
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,955
than other elements like gameplay or art.

478
00:27:35,955 --> 00:27:37,756
Like it's that important.

479
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:38,717
It drives review scores.

480
00:27:38,717 --> 00:27:40,978
And if you want to try to quantify this

481
00:27:40,978 --> 00:27:42,759
and put it in dollars and cents,

482
00:27:42,759 --> 00:27:46,462
you know, say this is actually can benefit your review scores

483
00:27:46,462 --> 00:27:48,083
which in fact impacts sales.

484
00:27:48,083 --> 00:27:50,284
I mean, it's right there, you know,

485
00:27:50,284 --> 00:27:51,004
in kind of black and white

486
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:52,285
if you're looking for actual data.

487
00:27:52,476 --> 00:27:54,556
You could also point to Telltale Games and go,

488
00:27:54,556 --> 00:27:56,177
well, apparently there's some studio out there

489
00:27:56,177 --> 00:27:59,317
that makes a lot of money just telling stories in games.

490
00:27:59,317 --> 00:28:03,298
Like, apparently that's working out really well for them.

491
00:28:03,298 --> 00:28:05,539
I would actually go, I would do all of that,

492
00:28:05,539 --> 00:28:07,059
but I'd also go a slightly different route,

493
00:28:07,059 --> 00:28:09,320
and that is have a couple of games in mind

494
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:12,520
that you can try out that are not explicitly story-heavy

495
00:28:12,520 --> 00:28:14,421
or what we would normally think of story-heavy games.

496
00:28:14,421 --> 00:28:16,301
So, you know, for example, there's lots of people

497
00:28:16,301 --> 00:28:17,561
that say, oh, Five Nights at Freddy's,

498
00:28:17,561 --> 00:28:18,342
that's not got much of a story.

499
00:28:18,342 --> 00:28:19,582
And I'm like, yes, it does.

500
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,682
Here's all the story that's in it.

501
00:28:21,802 --> 00:28:25,464
or some other games that maybe don't even have any text at all,

502
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:28,425
but you can point to, like, this is how the art, you know,

503
00:28:28,425 --> 00:28:32,766
this is how the art, the music, like everything combines to convey a mood

504
00:28:32,766 --> 00:28:36,608
or convey a story, and hey, narrative design is all about that.

505
00:28:37,690 --> 00:28:42,853
I think your best bet is going to be through networking, when you are talking one-on-one

506
00:28:42,853 --> 00:28:47,655
with someone, and as Michelle was saying, you have your arsenal of examples.

507
00:28:47,655 --> 00:28:54,258
You know, one I like to use is Plague Inc., which has a very specific story and has lots

508
00:28:54,258 --> 00:28:58,020
of dynamic world-building, but a lot of people would look at that game and say, there's no

509
00:28:58,020 --> 00:28:59,261
story and there's no world-building.

510
00:28:59,261 --> 00:29:00,581
Well, yes, it's right in front of you.

511
00:29:00,581 --> 00:29:03,362
You see what's happening in real time.

512
00:29:03,362 --> 00:29:03,463
So

513
00:29:04,579 --> 00:29:06,780
Being here is really great.

514
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:08,841
Try to find other networking events

515
00:29:08,841 --> 00:29:11,823
because there are a lot of people now who want to make games

516
00:29:11,823 --> 00:29:13,825
and you're probably in the position

517
00:29:13,825 --> 00:29:16,387
where you're probably going to be looking for work soon.

518
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:19,149
So if you can convince them,

519
00:29:19,149 --> 00:29:21,550
and it's getting a lot easier all the time

520
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,071
because they want to be convinced.

521
00:29:23,071 --> 00:29:25,193
They know they need to make games.

522
00:29:25,633 --> 00:29:29,776
So listen very carefully to what they're saying, because they'll probably tell you a lot about

523
00:29:29,776 --> 00:29:35,220
their project, and based upon what they are telling you, grab an example that is similar

524
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:38,963
to what they're doing, and explain to them using that example.

525
00:29:38,963 --> 00:29:43,646
Don't explain to them directly, here's how you fix your game, because then they don't

526
00:29:43,646 --> 00:29:45,328
need to hire you.

527
00:29:45,328 --> 00:29:49,691
But, you know, listen very carefully, grab an example that's very illustrative of what

528
00:29:49,691 --> 00:29:50,251
they're trying to do.

529
00:29:53,378 --> 00:29:57,699
as sort of a cynical point of view on this, that if you're, I mean, it sort of depends

530
00:29:57,699 --> 00:30:01,041
on the situation, like if it's your friends who are making a game and you want to tell

531
00:30:01,041 --> 00:30:04,222
them to convince, to convince them they should add more story to it, I think you have a shot.

532
00:30:04,222 --> 00:30:09,043
If you're like going up to a team that's established and is working well and doesn't think they

533
00:30:09,043 --> 00:30:10,364
need story, like...

534
00:30:11,484 --> 00:30:14,506
I don't know. It can be hard to flip them.

535
00:30:14,506 --> 00:30:18,169
And if they say, well, I guess so, and sort of let you in to do some stuff,

536
00:30:18,169 --> 00:30:20,350
they'll probably end up cutting you off at the knees most of the time anyway,

537
00:30:20,350 --> 00:30:22,432
because they never wanted a story in the first place.

538
00:30:22,432 --> 00:30:23,713
Now this person shows up.

539
00:30:23,713 --> 00:30:26,575
And I've certainly been in those situations on big projects at studios

540
00:30:26,575 --> 00:30:28,296
where whoever was in charge of the project

541
00:30:28,596 --> 00:30:32,022
didn't think story was necessary, but someone told him to bring someone in,

542
00:30:32,022 --> 00:30:35,166
and they can continue to undermine them for the entire process and say,

543
00:30:35,166 --> 00:30:38,091
see, we didn't need story. So you got to look at the situation you're going

544
00:30:38,091 --> 00:30:40,936
into. And is it possible to actually convert these people? Or should I just

545
00:30:40,936 --> 00:30:42,959
go look somewhere else where it's going to be more receptive?

546
00:30:43,642 --> 00:30:48,844
Yeah, if you're talking with a team that you're trying to convince of the value, you may be

547
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:49,664
talking to the wrong team.

548
00:30:49,664 --> 00:30:50,085
Right.

549
00:30:50,085 --> 00:30:51,825
At this point, there's so much evidence everywhere.

550
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:54,606
They may need to discover this by themselves, which they often do.

551
00:30:54,606 --> 00:30:58,548
You may say, hey, you know, your game might be better with some narrative put in here

552
00:30:58,548 --> 00:31:00,428
and here, but let me know if you need any help.

553
00:31:00,428 --> 00:31:01,509
And just let them go.

554
00:31:01,509 --> 00:31:06,271
And you may get a call in six months when it's hit the fan, and they realize that they

555
00:31:06,271 --> 00:31:06,451
don't...

556
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,791
And could you just come in and write the dialogue?

557
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:12,012
Well, yeah, but then maybe next time afterward,

558
00:31:12,012 --> 00:31:14,713
they will have learned their lesson, and you will say,

559
00:31:14,713 --> 00:31:15,973
I can fix this dialogue, but you know,

560
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,354
I could have done a lot more if I could change this and this,

561
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,415
which I know I can't because you've already locked it in.

562
00:31:20,415 --> 00:31:23,015
But maybe next time I could help you earlier.

563
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:25,176
And that may be a long-term relationship.

564
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:26,776
But sometimes they have to, a lot of times,

565
00:31:26,776 --> 00:31:28,437
they have to discover it for themselves.

566
00:31:28,437 --> 00:31:29,517
They think they know how to write.

567
00:31:29,517 --> 00:31:30,417
They think they can handle it.

568
00:31:31,838 --> 00:31:33,119
Or they think they don't need story at all.

569
00:31:33,119 --> 00:31:34,379
Right, or they don't need story at all.

570
00:31:34,379 --> 00:31:37,360
And someone says, this is really flat, doesn't feel right, what could help?

571
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:37,861
Maybe a story.

572
00:31:37,861 --> 00:31:40,182
And then suddenly they realize that they're in trouble.

573
00:31:40,182 --> 00:31:43,963
And they call in someone like you or someone like us to try to rescue them.

574
00:31:43,963 --> 00:31:48,966
And we do our best, but we have to explain that the reason we can only do so much is because it waited so long.

575
00:31:48,966 --> 00:31:54,528
And maybe next time there will be one of those studios that does value what a narrative person can bring early on.

576
00:31:54,528 --> 00:31:55,148
But, you know.

577
00:31:55,148 --> 00:31:55,549
Thank you.

578
00:32:00,788 --> 00:32:06,391
Hello. So writing is a process of iteration and reiteration.

579
00:32:06,391 --> 00:32:10,993
And that is important because that's so in your endeavors,

580
00:32:10,993 --> 00:32:14,414
you want your writing to be as polished, as organized as possible.

581
00:32:14,414 --> 00:32:14,915
And.

582
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:19,957
I mean, every writer has his or her own process when it comes to writing.

583
00:32:19,957 --> 00:32:26,500
So I wanted to ask you folks, you know, what is personally the process that has proven

584
00:32:26,500 --> 00:32:33,263
most effective in your writing endeavors when it comes to creative writing and game writing

585
00:32:33,263 --> 00:32:33,803
overall?

586
00:32:35,861 --> 00:32:39,324
First off, indicate the person on the team who is in charge of the story.

587
00:32:39,324 --> 00:32:48,132
They may not be in charge of the project, but that person is empowered to have all the authority and responsibility over the story changes, as long as it's in accordance with the game systems.

588
00:32:48,132 --> 00:32:57,140
When there's multiple writers in the project, make that hierarchy very clear within the writers as well, so they always know who the creative lead is, or the lead writer is.

589
00:32:57,500 --> 00:33:03,083
and they recognize that they're actually trying to help that lead writer realize the vision for that story.

590
00:33:03,083 --> 00:33:08,907
And he in turn is trying to help the game realize its vision, but he feels the story is the best way to do that.

591
00:33:08,907 --> 00:33:18,372
And the responsibility, the lead writer would usually do the drafts of the story up into a point.

592
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:20,193
Usually I find by the third draft.

593
00:33:20,653 --> 00:33:24,955
you either need to figure out what the strengths of that story are or scrap it.

594
00:33:24,955 --> 00:33:28,496
Usually by the third draft, the lead writer has come up with,

595
00:33:28,496 --> 00:33:31,417
we feel this is the appropriate spine for the story,

596
00:33:31,417 --> 00:33:33,818
now let's reinforce it and build off of that.

597
00:33:35,129 --> 00:33:42,253
I would say have finite feedback windows because anytime you have a whole team of writers in

598
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:42,913
a studio...

599
00:33:42,913 --> 00:33:43,273
Oh my God.

600
00:33:43,273 --> 00:33:47,435
If you've ever popped open a document that a hundred people have commented on, you're

601
00:33:47,435 --> 00:33:49,676
just like, I'm done.

602
00:33:49,676 --> 00:33:51,917
There's no way I'm going to get through this.

603
00:33:51,917 --> 00:33:53,398
Like a month has passed.

604
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:55,379
Why is there a hundred people commenting on this?

605
00:33:55,379 --> 00:33:56,560
Like Jesus effing Christ.

606
00:33:56,780 --> 00:34:03,522
It's like, you know, marketing, your time to look at this and give us feedback is between this date and this date.

607
00:34:03,522 --> 00:34:07,583
And then after that, we're moving with whatever you said at this time.

608
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,624
They're just words. Can't you just reorder them?

609
00:34:09,624 --> 00:34:21,128
You can get yourself into a real situation because if people are making changes all along and all along and all along, it's like, when is this thing ever done?

610
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:22,248
You have to reach a point.

611
00:34:22,548 --> 00:34:24,410
Because there is a release date, people, right?

612
00:34:24,410 --> 00:34:24,910
There just is.

613
00:34:24,910 --> 00:34:30,036
And you have to be willing to declare it done at some point.

614
00:34:30,036 --> 00:34:31,958
Even if you're not 100% happy with it,

615
00:34:31,958 --> 00:34:34,640
there is going to be a time when you have to declare it done.

616
00:34:34,640 --> 00:34:37,724
And so assigning which groups are

617
00:34:37,724 --> 00:34:39,605
allowed to give feedback at what points

618
00:34:39,605 --> 00:34:42,869
and making those feedback windows finite and

619
00:34:43,364 --> 00:34:47,528
schedule. Yeah, there has to be that cutoff point where the mutation has to stop.

620
00:34:47,528 --> 00:34:51,631
And you're like, this is the form you're going to take. And that's pretty much it.

621
00:34:51,631 --> 00:34:58,076
Because I actually ran into one problem in the studio where I realized that every time I gave feedback,

622
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:02,860
they'd completely rewrite the story. And at that point I'm like, okay, wow, actually feedback is getting really dangerous now.

623
00:35:03,500 --> 00:35:05,162
It's not actually helping anything.

624
00:35:05,162 --> 00:35:06,443
So I'm like, okay, well, we're just gonna take

625
00:35:06,443 --> 00:35:08,825
this story right now, don't change anything.

626
00:35:08,825 --> 00:35:11,227
Here's some very tiny specific things

627
00:35:11,227 --> 00:35:13,649
you might want to address, but you have to watch

628
00:35:13,649 --> 00:35:15,251
the iteration process too, because sometimes

629
00:35:15,251 --> 00:35:16,832
people can just jump off the deep end.

630
00:35:18,103 --> 00:35:21,387
I found the process, well, I mean, every game is different, every team is different, it's

631
00:35:21,387 --> 00:35:25,552
hard to say there's one process that you could apply to all situations, but one thing I always

632
00:35:25,552 --> 00:35:29,757
make sure I do is really focus on, especially if I'm brought in early enough, is to really

633
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:32,961
focus on the mechanics of the game, and what is the core of this game, and to play the

634
00:35:32,961 --> 00:35:37,507
game, and to understand, and to read the documentation on the vision for the gameplay.

635
00:35:37,767 --> 00:35:39,209
Because that's what we're trying to make better.

636
00:35:39,209 --> 00:35:42,072
We're trying to support it and enhance it and contextualize it.

637
00:35:42,072 --> 00:35:45,915
And if you just jump in with, well, we thought we were going to do this with the story, just

638
00:35:45,915 --> 00:35:46,636
run with that.

639
00:35:46,636 --> 00:35:50,000
And you don't stop and back up and go, wait, what is your game?

640
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:50,680
Show me the game.

641
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:51,441
Show me how it plays.

642
00:35:51,441 --> 00:35:55,205
And sometimes you need to take two steps back and say, you know what?

643
00:35:55,205 --> 00:35:57,767
This story that you've come up with doesn't match your game.

644
00:35:57,767 --> 00:36:00,850
This character you're talking about in the story isn't what you do in the game.

645
00:36:01,351 --> 00:36:04,413
So, and that's more of a narrative design type of angle,

646
00:36:04,413 --> 00:36:06,954
but you've got, you kind of go, maybe you have to go back

647
00:36:06,954 --> 00:36:08,575
one or two steps, possibly, I found,

648
00:36:08,575 --> 00:36:10,456
and really, with a fresh set of eyes,

649
00:36:10,456 --> 00:36:12,777
especially if you're coming in new,

650
00:36:12,777 --> 00:36:14,898
and say, you know, maybe we need to reevaluate

651
00:36:14,898 --> 00:36:18,060
where your story concept is, and let's match it better

652
00:36:18,060 --> 00:36:21,782
to what this game is really about, what you actually do, so.

653
00:36:22,113 --> 00:36:24,494
So I come from the opposite end of the spectrum

654
00:36:24,494 --> 00:36:26,255
because except for two projects,

655
00:36:26,255 --> 00:36:27,616
everything that I have worked on,

656
00:36:27,616 --> 00:36:31,097
I have been the sole narrative designer and or game writer.

657
00:36:31,097 --> 00:36:34,338
So to stop the infinite feedback,

658
00:36:34,338 --> 00:36:36,259
I have very clear milestones

659
00:36:36,259 --> 00:36:39,060
and I have milestones for client feedback.

660
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,241
And then I have milestones for payment

661
00:36:41,241 --> 00:36:42,902
that go along with drafts.

662
00:36:42,902 --> 00:36:46,624
So it's like, if you want more than two revisions,

663
00:36:46,624 --> 00:36:47,484
then you start paying me.

664
00:36:48,224 --> 00:36:54,432
for more revisions. And so with feedback, the feedback milestone, that says to them,

665
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:59,899
okay, you only have so many chances to give me feedback to change things before you pay

666
00:36:59,899 --> 00:37:04,745
me. And so they know that feedback needs to be excellent and it needs to be on target.

667
00:37:05,682 --> 00:37:11,623
Yeah, I find the financial accountability really causes those comments to sharpen very quickly.

668
00:37:11,623 --> 00:37:17,945
And also, if you're doing game writing, that you're getting feedback from a publisher or another developer,

669
00:37:17,945 --> 00:37:23,986
it's always good to have one person designated as the compiler of all the feedback from the studio,

670
00:37:23,986 --> 00:37:26,347
and that's actually specified in a contract somewhere.

671
00:37:27,231 --> 00:37:32,477
I guess the one thing I would add a little different is I like the expression I heard

672
00:37:32,477 --> 00:37:35,840
somewhere that if you're putting it out there and you're not slightly embarrassed by it,

673
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:40,025
you've probably worked on it too long and I think that's particularly true in like,

674
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:42,988
particularly if you're on a big project that's going to have a lot of iterations.

675
00:37:43,308 --> 00:37:54,771
and you need to like write the script for a level or something like that. You want to do a pass of it that's like pretty good but not insanely polished, not like every line agonized over forever because you know you're going to get around to feedback.

676
00:37:54,771 --> 00:38:00,373
And then it will be really interesting to see, oh, these are the things everyone didn't like. I'll work on that. I guess the other stuff is probably fine.

677
00:38:00,373 --> 00:38:05,254
I mean still go back and have your own polish pass to make yourself feel good about it, but don't.

678
00:38:05,254 --> 00:38:11,735
And also, as in the very iterative process, oh, sorry, we cut half the level. So all those lines you polished are now trash.

679
00:38:12,175 --> 00:38:13,958
So better to just get a good version out,

680
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:15,299
get a pretty good version out there,

681
00:38:15,299 --> 00:38:17,823
but don't kill yourself on it, knowing that you're going

682
00:38:17,823 --> 00:38:19,024
to have time to go back to it.

683
00:38:19,024 --> 00:38:21,407
But if you've got something like a voiceover session coming up,

684
00:38:21,407 --> 00:38:23,790
knowing, oh, god, I guess I better actually polish that

685
00:38:23,790 --> 00:38:23,970
now.

686
00:38:26,085 --> 00:38:30,447
I'm still kind of working out my favorite iteration process because I'm new, so I've

687
00:38:30,447 --> 00:38:33,649
worked on, like, in terms of the projects I've worked on, I've worked on everything

688
00:38:33,649 --> 00:38:38,012
from being the only narrative designer to being in a team where there's like multiple

689
00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:40,513
writers and none of us are allowed to talk to each other.

690
00:38:40,513 --> 00:38:41,834
Spoiler alert, don't do that.

691
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:47,876
And then the current team I'm with, you know, we have a meeting and we talk about stuff,

692
00:38:47,876 --> 00:38:52,497
and sometimes that's an incredibly useful iterative process, and other times I'm like,

693
00:38:52,497 --> 00:38:57,659
we've been talking about what this character should be named for two hours, oh dear, what happened?

694
00:38:57,659 --> 00:39:04,301
I would take away from that that, like, don't be afraid to ask for more, like, specifics

695
00:39:04,301 --> 00:39:08,883
if they're not giving you enough, because several times I've had, I don't know if you've ever had the feedback,

696
00:39:08,883 --> 00:39:11,223
this is great, it just needs to be tweaked a bit more.

697
00:39:11,843 --> 00:39:15,945
It's like, okay, do you want me to tweak the paper?

698
00:39:15,945 --> 00:39:19,146
What do you want from me?

699
00:39:19,146 --> 00:39:23,387
And the other thing is, I actually am kind of a fan when,

700
00:39:23,387 --> 00:39:26,808
if there's multiple writers, if there's a little bit like,

701
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:28,588
each writer has their specific task.

702
00:39:28,588 --> 00:39:32,269
You're doing this project, you're doing this part of the project.

703
00:39:32,269 --> 00:39:35,510
As long as there's good communication between the writers,

704
00:39:35,510 --> 00:39:37,371
I think that can actually be a very...

705
00:39:37,931 --> 00:39:43,055
handy way to do things because then, you know, you're not constantly iterating off each other,

706
00:39:43,055 --> 00:39:47,999
but you're able to give feedback to each other on your area of specialization. So I've had good

707
00:39:47,999 --> 00:39:52,303
experiences with that. Yeah, Michelle's right, we used to do that in the Fallout games where what

708
00:39:52,303 --> 00:39:55,885
we'd do is we'd actually segment each area and give each area to a different writer so they

709
00:39:55,885 --> 00:39:58,447
wouldn't be stepping on each other's toes like that. Yeah, that's a great idea.

710
00:39:59,497 --> 00:40:05,320
Also another thing I'd say, in terms of iteration, I do prefer it when one writer gets something out

711
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:10,442
and then everybody builds on what that writer has done, rather than, hey, we need this idea for this character

712
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:15,644
and everybody provides their character idea, because now it's like, well now we've got to go through what everyone has done

713
00:40:15,644 --> 00:40:21,907
and figure out what we're going to do, which can be very interesting, but can also be a little time-consuming.

714
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:25,088
And morally depressing.

715
00:40:27,411 --> 00:40:30,253
All right, thank you very much for the invaluable insight.

716
00:40:30,253 --> 00:40:31,474
Howdy.

717
00:40:31,474 --> 00:40:31,834
Hello.

718
00:40:31,834 --> 00:40:34,356
So one of the things that I found

719
00:40:34,356 --> 00:40:35,617
in talking to a lot of students who

720
00:40:35,617 --> 00:40:37,778
want to get into game writing is that they really

721
00:40:37,778 --> 00:40:39,719
want to write games.

722
00:40:39,719 --> 00:40:41,601
And it's really hard for them to divorce

723
00:40:41,601 --> 00:40:45,743
sort of the game mechanic aspect of game writing

724
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:48,465
to just look at good writing and interesting writing

725
00:40:48,465 --> 00:40:50,687
and really be excited from writing

726
00:40:50,687 --> 00:40:52,128
because they're not reading anything

727
00:40:52,128 --> 00:40:53,489
that isn't really a game.

728
00:40:54,229 --> 00:40:56,670
And they just don't understand how those things connect.

729
00:40:56,670 --> 00:40:59,050
So I think it would be super duper valuable

730
00:40:59,050 --> 00:41:00,951
if you guys just talked about what you've

731
00:41:00,951 --> 00:41:03,231
been reading recently, what's some really good writing you've

732
00:41:03,231 --> 00:41:04,471
discovered in the last couple of months, and throw that out

733
00:41:04,471 --> 00:41:06,932
so everybody knows what books they should buy and read

734
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:07,452
after this conference.

735
00:41:07,452 --> 00:41:09,312
I just got done reading The Circle by Dave Eggers.

736
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:09,632
I loved it.

737
00:41:09,632 --> 00:41:10,052
It was terrifying.

738
00:41:10,052 --> 00:41:10,673
So I recommend that one.

739
00:41:23,565 --> 00:41:26,688
I just started reading a book called Loosed Upon the World.

740
00:41:26,688 --> 00:41:28,290
It's a collection of short stories

741
00:41:28,290 --> 00:41:32,454
about environmental calamity that she wrote a story in.

742
00:41:32,454 --> 00:41:32,854
It's pretty cool.

743
00:41:32,854 --> 00:41:33,274
Thank you.

744
00:41:33,274 --> 00:41:33,354
Yeah.

745
00:41:36,726 --> 00:41:41,351
I admit I tend to have my favorites that I keep coming back to and will basically foist

746
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:43,373
on anyone who asks me, like, which book should I be reading?

747
00:41:43,373 --> 00:41:47,257
And one of them is, frankly, I reread Pride and Prejudice at least once a year.

748
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:49,379
I love that book to death.

749
00:41:49,379 --> 00:41:54,104
And actually, one of the best books I've read also in terms of

750
00:41:54,747 --> 00:42:00,549
interesting like integrating the research about a time period into the story was um Pillars of the

751
00:42:00,549 --> 00:42:06,030
Earth which is a novel by Ken Follett about cathedral building in medieval England and it's

752
00:42:06,030 --> 00:42:11,471
just it's got a riveting story and it's like but clearly he wants you to know he knows that he

753
00:42:11,471 --> 00:42:17,953
learned a lot about cathedral building so really good you know uh integration of the plot with the

754
00:42:17,953 --> 00:42:18,913
research that way.

755
00:42:21,581 --> 00:42:26,807
I read Steinbeck's East of Eden recently, a very long book, and one of the classics

756
00:42:26,807 --> 00:42:30,691
that kind of passed me by, I didn't catch the first time, when I was in school or whatever,

757
00:42:30,691 --> 00:42:34,996
they didn't have it, so I checked that out, and now I'm reading a Fred Saberhagen book

758
00:42:34,996 --> 00:42:39,921
called Empire of the East, so I have an East theme, and I'm working in the East right now,

759
00:42:39,921 --> 00:42:42,444
so I have a very East-based theme going right now.

760
00:42:43,124 --> 00:42:50,671
But yeah, your point is taken, that it's important to have influences outside the industry,

761
00:42:50,671 --> 00:42:55,556
just like it's important to have a rich tapestry to draw upon and different influences,

762
00:42:55,556 --> 00:42:58,719
not just books, but movies, great movies and great TV shows,

763
00:42:58,719 --> 00:43:04,003
and just have a variety of things you can draw upon.

764
00:43:04,163 --> 00:43:10,546
I had two sort of on that tip quickly, two interview questions that I would use to rule people out.

765
00:43:10,546 --> 00:43:14,148
One was name some games that are well written.

766
00:43:14,148 --> 00:43:17,890
And I would find a lot of writers who weren't game writers would say they're all terrible, they're out.

767
00:43:17,890 --> 00:43:19,971
Just because they're not paying attention, right?

768
00:43:19,971 --> 00:43:23,853
Like sure, a lot of games are badly written, but there are some good ones. Have you spent any time investigating it?

769
00:43:23,973 --> 00:43:26,554
And then the other one was, oh great, your game stuff is good.

770
00:43:26,554 --> 00:43:27,775
What else are you reading?

771
00:43:27,775 --> 00:43:28,535
What else are you doing?

772
00:43:28,535 --> 00:43:30,936
It's like, oh, well, I read the Halo novel and the thing.

773
00:43:30,936 --> 00:43:32,337
And there's nothing wrong with the Halo novel,

774
00:43:32,337 --> 00:43:32,977
and that's all fine.

775
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,718
But if they're so insular in that world,

776
00:43:34,718 --> 00:43:36,739
it's sort of like this is going to,

777
00:43:36,739 --> 00:43:38,620
they're not broad enough in their knowledge,

778
00:43:38,620 --> 00:43:40,421
exactly what you're saying, basically.

779
00:43:40,421 --> 00:43:43,182
Well, I had one, but I hope manga counts.

780
00:43:43,182 --> 00:43:47,504
And I'm going to butcher the title, Nijigahara Holograph,

781
00:43:47,504 --> 00:43:52,006
which is very David Lynchian and a very interesting style,

782
00:43:52,006 --> 00:43:52,906
very beautiful.

783
00:43:52,906 --> 00:43:53,127
So.

784
00:43:55,196 --> 00:44:00,719
I sort of have a reverse perspective where I punish myself whenever I'm not writing by watching Star Trek Voyager.

785
00:44:00,719 --> 00:44:06,401
And I usually find within 20 minutes I go back to writing.

786
00:44:06,401 --> 00:44:10,483
And the only non-fiction I'm reading right now is Proof, The Science of Booze.

787
00:44:11,343 --> 00:44:16,727
which was fascinating. But what I actually do is I actually do reading in

788
00:44:16,727 --> 00:44:21,530
the reverse in the sense that, so for example when I was writing on Wasteland 2

789
00:44:21,530 --> 00:44:24,432
I wanted to do like the Agricultural Center because I really liked that

790
00:44:24,432 --> 00:44:28,795
location in the first game, but then once I realized I was gonna be like writing an

791
00:44:28,795 --> 00:44:31,557
Agricultural Center that had grown out of control, I immediately went to the

792
00:44:31,557 --> 00:44:35,040
internet and I'm like well what are all the popular sources of fiction that have

793
00:44:35,040 --> 00:44:38,062
already covered this topic? So I'm like okay well I'm gonna watch Day of the

794
00:44:38,062 --> 00:44:39,563
Triffids, I'm gonna read Day of the Triffids.

795
00:44:40,284 --> 00:44:43,507
I'm going to go read, like, you know, Food of the Gods, like all those aspects, like,

796
00:44:43,507 --> 00:44:49,092
because I want to be aware of the range of connections I can possibly draw, and also

797
00:44:49,092 --> 00:44:52,996
be aware of the connections that I don't want to draw because some other source has already

798
00:44:52,996 --> 00:44:54,498
covered it already.

799
00:44:54,498 --> 00:44:59,262
So I sometimes approach reading in reverse, but it's very specific to what I'm writing

800
00:44:59,262 --> 00:44:59,302
on.

801
00:45:04,003 --> 00:45:06,765
Hi, my name's Bridget, I'm from New Zealand.

802
00:45:06,765 --> 00:45:12,087
I'm working on a large transmedia project for young girls, 8 to 12 year olds,

803
00:45:12,087 --> 00:45:16,329
which sits on the core platforms of TV, books and gaming.

804
00:45:16,329 --> 00:45:19,471
And it's the gaming part I'm here for, obviously.

805
00:45:19,471 --> 00:45:24,093
So my question is, do you have any thoughts or resources or...

806
00:45:25,953 --> 00:45:33,275
anything in terms of writing for children. I think young girls, 8 to 12 year olds, it's a very specific time.

807
00:45:33,275 --> 00:45:37,716
It's a really precious end of childhood, not quite adolescence,

808
00:45:37,716 --> 00:45:43,357
and my whole project is all about capturing the innocence and the joy and the wonder of childhood.

809
00:45:43,357 --> 00:45:48,078
And so in terms of writing, that's always my focus. I come from a writing background.

810
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:52,038
I'm a film and TV person originally, so yeah, any thoughts on that would be really cool.

811
00:45:52,367 --> 00:45:57,311
Yeah, actually eight of my nine titles were for children between the ages of 11 and 15.

812
00:45:57,311 --> 00:46:05,297
And what I found was it would be really easy to write in a way that talks down to them.

813
00:46:05,297 --> 00:46:08,259
And so what I did was two things.

814
00:46:08,259 --> 00:46:10,921
One was focus groups, focus groups, focus groups.

815
00:46:12,493 --> 00:46:16,355
Find out how they feel about the things that you're doing and whether they fly or not.

816
00:46:16,355 --> 00:46:20,937
Because kids, they can smell bullshit from really far away.

817
00:46:20,937 --> 00:46:25,018
And they are not shy about telling you what they like and what they don't like.

818
00:46:25,018 --> 00:46:26,859
And so focus groups are really helpful.

819
00:46:27,279 --> 00:46:32,260
But the first game that I worked on was for 11 to 14-year-old African-American children,

820
00:46:32,260 --> 00:46:36,021
and I'm about as far away from a 12-year-old black girl as one gets.

821
00:46:36,021 --> 00:46:41,503
And I went into the project really recognizing that and wanting to do it right.

822
00:46:41,503 --> 00:46:44,823
So what I did was I wrote the outlines of the story,

823
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:52,905
and then we went to a boys' and girls' club where there actually were kids in this demographic who the stories were for,

824
00:46:52,905 --> 00:46:54,786
and we had them act out the stories.

825
00:46:55,234 --> 00:47:02,817
And so a lot of the phraseology that I borrowed from when I wrote that dialogue was from when those kids were acting the stories out.

826
00:47:02,817 --> 00:47:08,359
So that it was being done in a way that was, you know, not going to be patronizing or offensive or anything like that.

827
00:47:08,359 --> 00:47:11,760
It was just, my suggestion would be to include the kids in the process.

828
00:47:11,760 --> 00:47:17,702
Yeah, that's really cool. I was a qualitative researcher in a previous incarnation, so I respond well to that. Thank you.

829
00:47:17,702 --> 00:47:18,703
I'd second that.

830
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:23,824
I usually find, however, that the focus groups will come to me because all my friends have...

831
00:47:24,825 --> 00:47:28,389
kids within that age range, they'll immediately start pitching games to me about dragons and

832
00:47:28,389 --> 00:47:31,332
unicorns and actually it's like ten times better than anything I could think of. I'm

833
00:47:31,332 --> 00:47:37,298
like, wow, this is great. But it often becomes an excuse to go meet and hang out with them

834
00:47:37,298 --> 00:47:41,141
and then I just listen to what the kids are talking about and I'm like, wow, that's pretty

835
00:47:41,141 --> 00:47:42,623
great. That's going to make me rich for a year.

836
00:47:43,884 --> 00:47:48,989
I've written for children, I've also written for children's games, and you had a very interesting

837
00:47:48,989 --> 00:47:55,274
age range there, 8 to 12, because there's a huge difference in maturity and interest

838
00:47:55,274 --> 00:47:56,395
between 8 year olds and 12 year olds.

839
00:47:56,395 --> 00:48:03,302
And also like the technical aspect of it, because writing for kids, I don't know if

840
00:48:03,302 --> 00:48:05,243
you have reading level requirements.

841
00:48:05,717 --> 00:48:11,802
So you have 12 year olds, but it's going to have to be on the reading level for 8 year

842
00:48:11,802 --> 00:48:11,982
olds.

843
00:48:11,982 --> 00:48:14,745
So that's going to be an issue too.

844
00:48:14,745 --> 00:48:20,570
It's got to be interesting enough for 12 year olds, but the language can't be so simple

845
00:48:20,570 --> 00:48:21,791
that they're not interested in it.

846
00:48:21,791 --> 00:48:25,854
But at the same time, it can't be so complex that the 8 year olds can't get into it as

847
00:48:25,854 --> 00:48:25,954
well.

848
00:48:25,954 --> 00:48:26,055
Yeah.

849
00:48:26,055 --> 00:48:26,295
Yeah.

850
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:28,176
Good point.

851
00:48:28,176 --> 00:48:30,338
And I guess the one thing I would add is...

852
00:48:31,350 --> 00:48:34,852
I don't have any experience doing this at all, so don't listen to my opinion on that,

853
00:48:34,852 --> 00:48:39,635
but the nightmare scenario to be in and to watch out for maybe is if you have, say, a

854
00:48:39,635 --> 00:48:44,017
member of the team or an executive who's got power over the project, who has a kid, who's

855
00:48:44,017 --> 00:48:48,200
this particular age, and suddenly they are the demographic, just that one child, and

856
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,822
then it just can become a nightmare scenario of like, well, Bobby doesn't like it, and

857
00:48:51,822 --> 00:48:53,763
like, well, yeah, but these other 20 kids did, like, doesn't he?

858
00:48:53,763 --> 00:48:54,464
You got to short yourself out.

859
00:48:54,464 --> 00:48:55,404
Bobby doesn't like you either.

860
00:48:55,404 --> 00:48:56,805
Bobby wants you fired.

861
00:48:56,805 --> 00:48:57,425
That's right.

862
00:48:57,425 --> 00:48:58,226
That's right.

863
00:48:58,807 --> 00:49:02,453
So just be wary of that sort of personal, because you know like an executive will be

864
00:49:02,453 --> 00:49:06,560
really close to their kid and suddenly they're running your project secretly behind the scenes

865
00:49:06,560 --> 00:49:07,402
or something like that.

866
00:49:07,402 --> 00:49:10,307
I'm always convinced they are anyway.

867
00:49:10,307 --> 00:49:10,467
Right.

868
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:11,730
Thank you very much.

869
00:49:14,368 --> 00:49:14,609
Hi.

870
00:49:14,609 --> 00:49:17,711
I'm a writer, but I currently work

871
00:49:17,711 --> 00:49:20,213
in monetization for a free-to-play game.

872
00:49:20,213 --> 00:49:23,895
And I am going to be transitioning into game design

873
00:49:23,895 --> 00:49:27,378
and more writing on free-to-play games soon.

874
00:49:27,378 --> 00:49:29,960
So my questions are kind of based on that.

875
00:49:29,960 --> 00:49:32,641
I kind of have two facets to the question.

876
00:49:32,641 --> 00:49:36,744
One is general tips for writing to free-to-play games,

877
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:39,466
where you can use it is a lot more restrictive.

878
00:49:39,466 --> 00:49:42,228
And also, the game's established.

879
00:49:42,508 --> 00:49:45,070
So you kind of have to squeeze it in.

880
00:49:45,070 --> 00:49:46,531
Tips for that.

881
00:49:46,531 --> 00:49:50,034
And also tips for writing for a game

882
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:52,555
that has the buildup of a narrative,

883
00:49:52,555 --> 00:49:55,077
but based on the way that free-to-play games are,

884
00:49:55,077 --> 00:49:57,939
probably will never have an ending point

885
00:49:57,939 --> 00:50:00,000
because the levels just keep going on.

886
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,102
So tips for both of those things.

887
00:50:02,242 --> 00:50:05,323
So I'm going to say something that's going to crush the hearts of all the writers in the room,

888
00:50:05,323 --> 00:50:09,426
but always make the narrative bits skippable.

889
00:50:09,426 --> 00:50:12,768
Because, you know, a lot of people are playing in short stretches.

890
00:50:12,768 --> 00:50:17,590
They are playing the mobile game because they'll just have a little bit of time.

891
00:50:17,590 --> 00:50:20,032
And so they don't have time for a lot of story.

892
00:50:20,032 --> 00:50:21,332
They want to get right to the gameplay.

893
00:50:22,093 --> 00:50:24,914
The other thing is, think about mobile games

894
00:50:24,914 --> 00:50:28,916
as bits of story, and like, you sprinkle that in.

895
00:50:28,916 --> 00:50:32,578
It doesn't have to be after every level, necessarily.

896
00:50:32,578 --> 00:50:35,400
If you have dialogue, it needs to be super short.

897
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,861
We talked about less is more,

898
00:50:36,861 --> 00:50:40,463
less is really, really, really more with mobile games.

899
00:50:40,463 --> 00:50:43,004
And also, think about smartphone screens

900
00:50:43,004 --> 00:50:45,305
instead of tablet screens.

901
00:50:45,305 --> 00:50:47,466
Because you can play the same games

902
00:50:47,466 --> 00:50:48,827
on the phone and the tablet.

903
00:50:49,427 --> 00:50:52,311
But the smartphone screen is going to be a lot more restrictive.

904
00:50:52,311 --> 00:50:55,015
So write for the smartphone and not for the tablet.

905
00:50:57,349 --> 00:51:03,132
I have actually been working on some free-to-play games at the moment, and I'm also doing a

906
00:51:03,132 --> 00:51:07,155
sort of a career transition at the moment.

907
00:51:07,155 --> 00:51:12,858
One thing I've been trying to do is, whenever possible, like, for example, you've got for

908
00:51:12,858 --> 00:51:18,441
most of these free-to-play games, you might have, for example, a resource that is going

909
00:51:18,441 --> 00:51:20,743
to be purchased through real-world dollars.

910
00:51:21,143 --> 00:51:27,270
I've actually tried to make an effort to actually integrate that within the story that it makes

911
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:27,971
sense in a way.

912
00:51:27,971 --> 00:51:32,116
Like, you know, for example, okay, well, you're collecting this, this, you know, maybe you're

913
00:51:32,116 --> 00:51:36,041
collecting stars and then there are these special stars that, yes, you do need to pay

914
00:51:36,041 --> 00:51:36,582
money for.

915
00:51:36,582 --> 00:51:37,363
So I've tried to...

916
00:51:38,564 --> 00:51:48,431
make it so that it feels like getting the more powerful resource is actually a part of the narrative of the game.

917
00:51:48,431 --> 00:51:54,735
Another thing I've done, I have been trying to do exactly what Toyo says and keep the writing short.

918
00:51:54,735 --> 00:51:57,237
I don't know how well I've succeeded.

919
00:51:57,237 --> 00:51:59,678
But yeah, definitely keep it skippable.

920
00:51:59,678 --> 00:51:59,978
And make...

921
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:09,962
I would actually say one thing I would definitely do is try to give the NPCs as much flavor

922
00:52:09,962 --> 00:52:14,543
within that small amount as you can, because I tried several free-to-play games in the

923
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:18,844
genre I'm writing in, and I'm like, this is just like, there's a character popping up,

924
00:52:18,844 --> 00:52:24,406
and they are literally just giving me exposition and tutorial text, and I'm feeling nothing

925
00:52:24,406 --> 00:52:25,646
for who this person is.

926
00:52:25,646 --> 00:52:29,447
Like, I know you're Kate Upton, I don't know what you, what, who are you?

927
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:30,347
What are you doing here?

928
00:52:31,388 --> 00:52:35,870
So I would definitely see what you can do to make those,

929
00:52:35,870 --> 00:52:38,832
make the way that you're delivering the tutorial

930
00:52:38,832 --> 00:52:41,194
and the instructions like interesting

931
00:52:41,194 --> 00:52:42,655
on a character level as well.

932
00:52:43,591 --> 00:52:46,913
I'm going to bring the room down even further and say that if you're going to work on a

933
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:51,955
free-to-play game, also don't sign a non-compete clause where you can't give advice about how

934
00:52:51,955 --> 00:52:55,997
to design or write for free-to-play games for a year after you leave a company.

935
00:52:55,997 --> 00:53:01,800
But in a completely unrelated topic, I've been playing this incredible game called Dungeon

936
00:53:01,800 --> 00:53:04,861
Boss, which doesn't have a lot of text, but there's a story involved there.

937
00:53:05,302 --> 00:53:07,623
hypothetically, it's just crazy.

938
00:53:07,623 --> 00:53:10,104
And the amount that they get away with,

939
00:53:10,104 --> 00:53:13,166
with just the naming of the abilities for each character,

940
00:53:13,166 --> 00:53:14,907
tells a ton about each character,

941
00:53:14,907 --> 00:53:17,008
as well as the animation set they have.

942
00:53:17,008 --> 00:53:18,409
Like, they have this one goblin

943
00:53:18,409 --> 00:53:20,590
who does a lot of, like, cheap shots,

944
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:22,652
and, like, obviously, like, he's a dirty fighter.

945
00:53:23,672 --> 00:53:27,814
They also have his animations that were like he's kind of a pyromaniac,

946
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:32,356
but he ends up, his attack move is he actually, he accidentally sets himself on fire,

947
00:53:32,356 --> 00:53:36,778
and then he runs around screaming the entire scream, but he burns all the enemies while he's doing it.

948
00:53:36,778 --> 00:53:40,099
That alone tells me five million words about that character right there.

949
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:43,300
So look for ways of animation, even the names of abilities,

950
00:53:43,300 --> 00:53:45,401
even the visual effects of how they're presented.

951
00:53:45,401 --> 00:53:48,342
That, that can be almost your entire story right there,

952
00:53:48,342 --> 00:53:50,783
depending on the presentation, and it requires no words whatsoever.

953
00:53:51,476 --> 00:53:56,218
Another thing, I was reminded when Michelle was talking about the dialogue,

954
00:53:56,218 --> 00:54:01,361
if you can get a range of character portraits and emotional states for like, say one character,

955
00:54:01,361 --> 00:54:06,544
maybe you can have up to four emotional states, so you can match the emotional state with the dialogue.

956
00:54:06,544 --> 00:54:11,207
Because usually you don't have voiceover, but if you can show like a neutral state,

957
00:54:11,207 --> 00:54:16,210
happy, frustrated, angry, sad, that visual helps a lot too.

958
00:54:16,907 --> 00:54:19,989
With regard to your question about a story that never ends,

959
00:54:19,989 --> 00:54:23,491
right, think about TV writing and the way

960
00:54:23,491 --> 00:54:25,892
that they just perpetuate character arcs.

961
00:54:25,892 --> 00:54:28,494
And of course, it's much broader and a much larger stage

962
00:54:28,494 --> 00:54:29,355
than what you're talking about.

963
00:54:29,355 --> 00:54:30,996
So you have to scale it down.

964
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:34,258
But finding out what happens to this character over this arc,

965
00:54:34,258 --> 00:54:36,259
and then as that's resolving, another arc

966
00:54:36,259 --> 00:54:37,900
starts with a different character, for example.

967
00:54:37,900 --> 00:54:39,681
So you can always have something on the go.

968
00:54:40,362 --> 00:54:42,642
as opposed to a big three-act structure

969
00:54:42,642 --> 00:54:45,403
where we're leading to a giant climax

970
00:54:45,403 --> 00:54:47,484
that never comes because we can't resolve the story, right?

971
00:54:47,484 --> 00:54:49,505
So you want to focus more on character arcs

972
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:51,966
and things resolving on a small scale

973
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:53,146
and overlapping with each other.

974
00:54:53,146 --> 00:54:55,807
Again, very much a small stage to do it,

975
00:54:55,807 --> 00:54:58,708
but there are ways to kind of thread those things through.

976
00:54:58,708 --> 00:55:00,809
You can think of it as a soap opera model.

977
00:55:00,809 --> 00:55:02,709
Think of it in terms of a soap opera.

978
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:06,691
You know, things are blowing up with this character

979
00:55:06,691 --> 00:55:09,092
and just before it resolves, something else happens.

980
00:55:09,397 --> 00:55:12,340
Now this one's been diagnosed with some horrible disease.

981
00:55:12,340 --> 00:55:16,343
And the episode always ends with like, you know, I know exactly what you're about to

982
00:55:16,343 --> 00:55:16,723
tell me.

983
00:55:16,723 --> 00:55:18,925
And then like goes, you know, you have to wait till tomorrow.

984
00:55:18,925 --> 00:55:21,567
And then they're like, oh, you're going to tell me that you're going out to the store

985
00:55:21,567 --> 00:55:22,228
to buy some milk.

986
00:55:22,228 --> 00:55:26,711
So don't wait till tomorrow or pay $5 to find out right now.

987
00:55:28,679 --> 00:55:36,386
And actually that also brings up something I kind of wanted to say and maybe I'm going to get, like, you know, attacked by rabid writers.

988
00:55:36,386 --> 00:55:38,588
It doesn't always have to be Shakespeare.

989
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:44,934
Like, it's okay to occasionally look at something and be like, it's okay to write a very silly story.

990
00:55:44,934 --> 00:55:47,997
Like, you can still write a silly story and still put...

991
00:55:48,678 --> 00:55:50,458
quality and effort into it.

992
00:55:50,458 --> 00:55:54,259
But, like, I remember I had, you know, one project where I was beating myself up about, like,

993
00:55:54,259 --> 00:55:58,341
why am I not, like, integrating all of these, like, deep artistic issues?

994
00:55:58,341 --> 00:56:01,241
And, like, kind of had to come to peace with, like,

995
00:56:01,241 --> 00:56:02,562
it's not that type of game.

996
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:07,863
It would feel, you know, it would feel kind of forced if I was trying to do it.

997
00:56:07,863 --> 00:56:11,044
It's working better as a narrative to do it this way, even though...

998
00:56:11,364 --> 00:56:13,506
It's a bit of a silly fantasy story, and that's okay.

999
00:56:31,383 --> 00:56:36,848
Hi, I'm a novelist, but in the publishing industry's own words,

1000
00:56:36,848 --> 00:56:39,570
adult fiction is anemic and insignificant.

1001
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,132
So I'm very interested in getting into games.

1002
00:56:41,132 --> 00:56:44,635
So I've made a couple of game proposals

1003
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:47,557
for my published and unpublished books.

1004
00:56:47,557 --> 00:56:49,899
I made a couple of text adventures for my website,

1005
00:56:49,899 --> 00:56:52,641
but with an eye to the job fair tomorrow.

1006
00:56:53,142 --> 00:56:56,624
I'm curious about how I ought to present myself.

1007
00:56:56,624 --> 00:57:01,047
I doubt I'm going to be brought on board with the AAA game to be the lead designer.

1008
00:57:01,047 --> 00:57:03,088
That doesn't make any sense.

1009
00:57:03,088 --> 00:57:08,952
With so many companies, and there's games that I like, but there's many more companies

1010
00:57:08,952 --> 00:57:14,095
making good stuff, I'm curious what advice you might have as to how I might match up

1011
00:57:14,095 --> 00:57:17,037
with a good team and how I ought to present myself to them.

1012
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:20,661
What's your interest in being a game writer?

1013
00:57:20,661 --> 00:57:23,661
Why do you want to be a game writer?

1014
00:57:23,661 --> 00:57:28,403
Well, it seems that people always want to get stories.

1015
00:57:28,403 --> 00:57:32,403
People love stories, but people aren't getting them from books.

1016
00:57:32,403 --> 00:57:36,164
Games have unique interactivity,

1017
00:57:36,164 --> 00:57:40,045
but being able to blend cinematic qualities.

1018
00:57:40,946 --> 00:57:44,647
of sound and character design and all that.

1019
00:57:44,647 --> 00:57:46,348
It seems like a great new medium.

1020
00:57:46,348 --> 00:57:48,429
We've been waiting for, there was a hypertext

1021
00:57:48,429 --> 00:57:51,250
and that was supposed to be the next thing in storytelling

1022
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,771
and that didn't take off because it's not fun to play

1023
00:57:53,771 --> 00:57:57,553
and the writing wasn't really up to what it needed to be.

1024
00:57:57,553 --> 00:58:00,774
So I'm interested in being on the winning side of things.

1025
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:06,052
Okay, because whenever I talk to someone who's a writer from another industry, I ask them why,

1026
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:11,877
and do they play a lot of games, and what games do they play, and you know, is it just seeing,

1027
00:58:11,877 --> 00:58:15,240
is it a question of you're passionate about games, and you love games, you love playing games,

1028
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:18,563
and you're interested in learning about game mechanics, and getting really hip deep in that,

1029
00:58:18,563 --> 00:58:24,088
because that's, there's probably no harder, I mean it's just, you know, Rihanna was just

1030
00:58:24,088 --> 00:58:27,371
saying next door that writing in games is like writing in a headwind.

1031
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:28,611
compared to other media.

1032
00:58:28,611 --> 00:58:30,012
It is just that much more challenging

1033
00:58:30,012 --> 00:58:31,153
because there's so many more complications.

1034
00:58:31,153 --> 00:58:34,154
And so you've got to have that passion.

1035
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:37,256
You've got to have that interest in getting really into Excel

1036
00:58:37,256 --> 00:58:40,077
spreadsheets and tools and technology,

1037
00:58:40,077 --> 00:58:41,778
not necessarily becoming a programmer,

1038
00:58:41,778 --> 00:58:44,259
but understanding what programs do and what they can and can't

1039
00:58:44,259 --> 00:58:44,379
do.

1040
00:58:44,379 --> 00:58:47,081
And there's so much involved.

1041
00:58:47,081 --> 00:58:49,662
So my core advice is you need to really

1042
00:58:49,662 --> 00:58:51,083
be passionate about games.

1043
00:58:51,083 --> 00:58:54,344
It can't just be you see this as a frontier, as a writer,

1044
00:58:54,344 --> 00:58:55,805
and you feel like you should be there.

1045
00:58:55,805 --> 00:58:56,285
It's more like.

1046
00:58:56,585 --> 00:59:00,728
you should be passionate about being there because you're competing with those who are passionate

1047
00:59:00,728 --> 00:59:04,950
and do play a lot of games and understand how games are made. So that's the top level.

1048
00:59:04,950 --> 00:59:10,673
Discovering the Telltale games really opened up my mind to the possibilities. I used to take

1049
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:14,115
apart choose your own adventure books like a budding engineer would take apart a vacuum

1050
00:59:14,115 --> 00:59:20,038
cleaner to see how they worked and seeing this now finally come to fruition, I thought I really

1051
00:59:20,038 --> 00:59:23,660
love this and I think I could do this and I would like to do this.

1052
00:59:24,429 --> 00:59:28,893
And I definitely think start with that as your pitch for yourself of saying like, I

1053
00:59:28,893 --> 00:59:32,936
really got into telltale games and I realized this is cool not, oh, I used to be a writer

1054
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:33,937
and obviously that's dying.

1055
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:35,098
So where should I go now?

1056
00:59:35,098 --> 00:59:39,202
You know, just to be honest, that's that's going to turn off certain people who are like,

1057
00:59:39,202 --> 00:59:40,083
well, forget this guy.

1058
00:59:40,083 --> 00:59:43,245
And I would think for your meetings this week where you're pitching your own properties

1059
00:59:43,245 --> 00:59:43,986
that you own.

1060
00:59:44,827 --> 00:59:46,547
you know, should really view it as an entree

1061
00:59:46,547 --> 00:59:49,108
into a conversation about what they actually need written,

1062
00:59:49,108 --> 00:59:52,449
maybe, and not, like, think of it like maybe you'll

1063
00:59:52,449 --> 00:59:53,609
maybe you'll get one of them interested

1064
00:59:53,609 --> 00:59:54,989
in one of your properties or something like that,

1065
00:59:54,989 --> 00:59:55,950
but it's kind of unlikely,

1066
00:59:55,950 --> 00:59:58,710
but it's more of like a look I can write

1067
00:59:58,710 --> 00:59:59,851
and I did this pitch on it

1068
00:59:59,851 --> 01:00:02,031
that's really looks like a game already or whatever

1069
01:00:02,031 --> 01:00:04,932
and shows that I get it and I'm really into it

1070
01:00:04,932 --> 01:00:06,973
and that, oh, and you need this other thing written?

1071
01:00:06,973 --> 01:00:08,493
Well, I could do that too, you know,

1072
01:00:08,493 --> 01:00:09,814
and that's gonna, I think,

1073
01:00:09,814 --> 01:00:11,154
more likely scenarios work out, to be honest.

1074
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:15,188
Thanks, we'll try to get to the last two.

1075
01:00:15,188 --> 01:00:15,809
Hello, I'll be really quick.

1076
01:00:15,809 --> 01:00:19,052
I'm working as a narrative designer at the moment

1077
01:00:19,052 --> 01:00:21,815
on my first game, and one of the things

1078
01:00:21,815 --> 01:00:25,499
that I found challenging is I will write a lot,

1079
01:00:25,499 --> 01:00:28,582
and the team obviously doesn't want to read it.

1080
01:00:29,542 --> 01:00:32,024
So I was just wondering, what are some tips and tricks

1081
01:00:32,024 --> 01:00:34,426
and methods that you guys use to communicate your story

1082
01:00:34,426 --> 01:00:37,508
and keep that across, or the team across what the story is

1083
01:00:37,508 --> 01:00:38,729
and how it's changing?

1084
01:00:38,729 --> 01:00:40,050
Bullet points.

1085
01:00:40,050 --> 01:00:43,973
Bullet points, flow charts, things like that?

1086
01:00:43,973 --> 01:00:45,495
If it's something descriptive,

1087
01:00:45,495 --> 01:00:47,176
if it's something that animators

1088
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:50,018
and artists are going to be using,

1089
01:00:50,018 --> 01:00:52,100
I put all the descriptive stuff up front

1090
01:00:52,100 --> 01:00:54,722
and then the more detailed stuff later

1091
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:58,625
because I know they tend not to like to read a whole lot.

1092
01:00:59,525 --> 01:01:02,247
So, you know, like the game designers, the game writers,

1093
01:01:02,247 --> 01:01:04,448
they can read the stuff that's at the end,

1094
01:01:04,448 --> 01:01:08,731
but keep stuff that's descriptive and upfront and brief.

1095
01:01:09,833 --> 01:01:32,958
Yeah, sometimes for projects, it actually does just do a PowerPoint presentation of the main characters and like the plot lines and it did involve a lot of flowcharts, but it also includes things like a lot of reference art for like, here's how here's here's some sources of inspiration for this character. So you know what I'm thinking about when I'm writing them, the artist doesn't have to actually do those specific reference images, but they understand where I'm coming from. So we can sort of meet somewhere in the middle.

1096
01:01:33,539 --> 01:01:39,843
And generally, like, yeah, it's generally hard to get anyone else on the team to read a lot of text.

1097
01:01:39,843 --> 01:01:45,708
Usually when, like, asking for a specific character look, often with artists, it's doing what Toya says,

1098
01:01:45,708 --> 01:01:51,432
where you make a very brief list of bullet points, and then I dump a bunch of reference art in a folder on the net,

1099
01:01:51,432 --> 01:01:56,336
and then they go look at it, and they meditate on it for a while, and they come back with a number of variations for that character.

1100
01:01:56,336 --> 01:01:56,636
Exactly that.

1101
01:01:59,703 --> 01:02:01,565
in any way you can dramatize the story,

1102
01:02:01,565 --> 01:02:03,906
like a PowerPoint with art, and you can act it out,

1103
01:02:03,906 --> 01:02:06,548
and you can kind of dramatize it and get them excited.

1104
01:02:06,548 --> 01:02:07,988
Get up, stand up and use your hands,

1105
01:02:07,988 --> 01:02:10,790
and really, if you were there with them,

1106
01:02:10,790 --> 01:02:12,231
you know, that's gonna draw them in

1107
01:02:12,231 --> 01:02:14,693
much more than any document probably will.

1108
01:02:14,693 --> 01:02:17,274
And Evan's right, another way you can sort of

1109
01:02:17,274 --> 01:02:20,756
dramatize it too is if some concept art is already done.

1110
01:02:20,756 --> 01:02:22,918
I generally find that artists really get excited

1111
01:02:22,918 --> 01:02:24,639
about a presentation when they see their images

1112
01:02:24,639 --> 01:02:26,240
up being presented before the whole company,

1113
01:02:26,240 --> 01:02:27,741
and they're like, oh, that's my art, wow,

1114
01:02:27,741 --> 01:02:28,921
that sounds pretty cool.

1115
01:02:29,662 --> 01:02:33,723
And this is the final thought, you know, I have a friend Liz England who talks about

1116
01:02:33,723 --> 01:02:36,984
writing with the audience in mind any document you create, like you shouldn't just write

1117
01:02:36,984 --> 01:02:39,864
a design document, you should write one for the animator, one for the programmer, one

1118
01:02:39,864 --> 01:02:44,205
for whatever, and she's doing a talk about this on Friday at 1.30 in the Rules of the

1119
01:02:44,205 --> 01:02:47,726
Game session that you might want to check out because she talks about all the ways she's

1120
01:02:47,726 --> 01:02:50,467
written different documents for every possible audience on the team.

1121
01:02:50,807 --> 01:02:51,808
Awesome.

1122
01:02:51,808 --> 01:02:56,090
Some things that's worked for the team I'm working with is one, whenever possible, they

1123
01:02:56,090 --> 01:03:00,652
will actually try and embed a writer into one of the other scrums so that there's someone

1124
01:03:00,652 --> 01:03:04,334
not necessarily giving them documents but actually able to answer questions on the fly.

1125
01:03:04,334 --> 01:03:07,876
And the other thing is, as weird as it sounds, we have a company newsletter where we have

1126
01:03:07,876 --> 01:03:11,678
to break down, every scrum has to break down, there are three main points that's important

1127
01:03:11,678 --> 01:03:13,659
for the rest of the scrums to know.

1128
01:03:13,659 --> 01:03:17,181
And that's actually been really useful to break it down in three points.

1129
01:03:17,901 --> 01:03:21,263
This is what the rest of you need to know about what narrative is doing.

1130
01:03:21,263 --> 01:03:22,124
Yeah.

1131
01:03:22,124 --> 01:03:28,728
Last question and also really quickly we'll be at the wrap-up room right across in 3022.

1132
01:03:28,728 --> 01:03:37,655
Hi, I am creating an immersive media game and the thing that is bringing people through is

1133
01:03:37,655 --> 01:03:41,297
a creation myth of how the world was created and our purpose here and saving the planet.

1134
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:44,019
And I've never created a game before.

1135
01:03:44,559 --> 01:03:48,503
And so my big question is, who do I need to bring on my team?

1136
01:03:48,503 --> 01:03:50,945
Or what games would you point to and say, wow,

1137
01:03:50,945 --> 01:03:53,447
you want to learn and study this?

1138
01:03:53,447 --> 01:03:55,148
But again, my big question is, as I

1139
01:03:55,148 --> 01:03:56,970
form this board of advisors and our team members,

1140
01:03:56,970 --> 01:04:01,093
who would you recommend as good people to bring on?

1141
01:04:01,093 --> 01:04:01,834
I can tell a story.

1142
01:04:01,834 --> 01:04:04,296
I've never done it in the form of a game before.

1143
01:04:04,568 --> 01:04:06,490
Did you say you've never played a game before?

1144
01:04:06,490 --> 01:04:07,631
Oh, I've played a game before, yes.

1145
01:04:07,631 --> 01:04:09,373
You've never made a game before?

1146
01:04:09,373 --> 01:04:12,756
Like, I've got a great story, I've never gamified it before.

1147
01:04:12,756 --> 01:04:16,821
And so we're looking at how do we gamify this so that people go through this game experience

1148
01:04:16,821 --> 01:04:18,983
where they get to be a part of saving the world, you know.

1149
01:04:18,983 --> 01:04:20,224
I would definitely bring on...

1150
01:04:20,825 --> 01:04:29,768
a narrative designer or two, to help you figure out how to integrate the gameplay and the story,

1151
01:04:29,768 --> 01:04:34,410
and especially because immersion is really important. So your narrative designer would

1152
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:36,190
figure out how not to break immersion.

1153
01:04:37,913 --> 01:04:39,293
And it's interesting that for a while,

1154
01:04:39,293 --> 01:04:42,174
there were a lot of movie games that were made,

1155
01:04:42,174 --> 01:04:44,054
like say, oh, the new Star Wars movie is coming out,

1156
01:04:44,054 --> 01:04:45,154
so we should have a game about that.

1157
01:04:45,154 --> 01:04:47,035
And they would try to follow the same plot

1158
01:04:47,035 --> 01:04:48,395
as the movie or whatever.

1159
01:04:48,395 --> 01:04:49,836
And those were inevitably terrible,

1160
01:04:49,836 --> 01:04:53,696
because you really need to write the plot for your game

1161
01:04:53,696 --> 01:04:55,597
and not just like, we've got this existing plot,

1162
01:04:55,597 --> 01:04:56,437
we can apply it to whatever.

1163
01:04:56,437 --> 01:04:58,197
So you'll see a lot of the successful adaptations

1164
01:04:58,197 --> 01:05:00,978
these days are really writing a pretty custom plot,

1165
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:02,578
maybe in the same world, same settings,

1166
01:05:02,578 --> 01:05:03,759
some of the same characters,

1167
01:05:03,759 --> 01:05:05,139
but really changing it substantially.

1168
01:05:05,139 --> 01:05:06,879
And that's where a narrative designer could come in

1169
01:05:06,879 --> 01:05:07,720
to help you structure that.

1170
01:05:08,481 --> 01:05:14,833
I was going to say you might want to expose yourself to a lot of different kinds of storytelling

1171
01:05:14,833 --> 01:05:17,017
to see what you can draw from different things.

1172
01:05:17,482 --> 01:05:22,824
I recently was in Nashville and did an escape the room experience in Nashville.

1173
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:27,927
And you wouldn't necessarily think that there's story that has to take place with that, but

1174
01:05:27,927 --> 01:05:29,608
there really is, right?

1175
01:05:29,608 --> 01:05:35,771
And so, you know, maybe just play different types of games and see what kinds of things

1176
01:05:35,771 --> 01:05:38,492
you're really drawn to and really work that you can draw from.

1177
01:05:38,492 --> 01:05:44,075
And you will find very quickly both what you really like and what you really don't.

1178
01:05:45,866 --> 01:05:50,108
I was going to say definitely bring a narrative designer on board, but something you can also

1179
01:05:50,108 --> 01:05:55,031
do for yourself to kind of get at least some of the beginnings of understanding how this

1180
01:05:55,031 --> 01:06:01,835
sort of, the way game storytelling can work is to actually see if you can experiment and

1181
01:06:01,835 --> 01:06:03,636
twine.

1182
01:06:03,636 --> 01:06:08,478
It's admittedly, that's a branching, a specific branching type of narrative, but I've actually

1183
01:06:08,478 --> 01:06:14,521
found it's a very good visualization of understanding how game style branching narrative works.

1184
01:06:15,222 --> 01:06:18,582
You might find, oh I had this one central plot line,

1185
01:06:18,582 --> 01:06:21,503
but now there's all these random branches

1186
01:06:21,503 --> 01:06:22,663
that are going off into nowhere.

1187
01:06:22,663 --> 01:06:24,464
I now need to write a new story for that.

1188
01:06:24,464 --> 01:06:27,544
So it's actually, I think, a very good beginner way

1189
01:06:27,544 --> 01:06:30,485
to kind of, well maybe beginner's not quite the right word,

1190
01:06:30,485 --> 01:06:35,306
but a good intro way to sort of wrap your brain around

1191
01:06:35,306 --> 01:06:37,386
context-sensitive storytelling, really.

1192
01:06:37,747 --> 01:06:38,968
And that's called Twine?

1193
01:06:38,968 --> 01:06:43,252
Yeah, it's a free tool on the internet and there are many very good tutorials for that

1194
01:06:43,252 --> 01:06:45,253
on the internet as well.

1195
01:06:45,253 --> 01:06:50,438
And Twine 2 has actually gotten reasonably sophisticated with the things that you can

1196
01:06:50,438 --> 01:06:56,223
do with it, you know, with visuals and audio and you can build systems into Twines now.

1197
01:06:56,223 --> 01:06:59,687
It's pretty, it's a pretty powerful free thing.

1198
01:06:59,687 --> 01:07:01,028
And it's great for experimentation too.

1199
01:07:02,053 --> 01:07:02,654
Thank you.

1200
01:07:02,654 --> 01:07:04,677
Thank you guys so much for coming again.

1201
01:07:04,677 --> 01:07:07,481
Some of us will be in the wrap-up room, which

1202
01:07:07,481 --> 01:07:09,584
is right across the hall.

1203
01:07:09,584 --> 01:07:09,884
Thank you.
