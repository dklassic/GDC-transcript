1
00:00:03,025 --> 00:00:06,247
So yes, this talk is about efficiency for game designers.

2
00:00:06,827 --> 00:00:08,188
It's gonna draw a lot on what I learned

3
00:00:08,248 --> 00:00:11,451
making my first game, Gunpoint, which looks like this.

4
00:00:12,552 --> 00:00:13,572
We'll see how the volumes go.

5
00:00:13,752 --> 00:00:14,053
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,435 --> 00:00:17,915
Do we have sound?

7
00:00:21,998 --> 00:00:23,880
So it's a game where you're breaking

8
00:00:23,900 --> 00:00:25,120
into these high security buildings.

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:27,742
You have to get past all these security measures,

10
00:00:28,183 --> 00:00:30,204
and the way you do that is by using a crosslink device.

11
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:33,797
are...

12
00:00:33,817 --> 00:00:35,778
I'll just make that better a bit.

13
00:00:35,798 --> 00:00:38,280
Now, all the electronics on the level are wired up,

14
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:40,701
so you can see which light switches connect to which lights,

15
00:00:40,961 --> 00:00:42,782
and then you can also drag those connections around,

16
00:00:42,942 --> 00:00:48,185
so you can set a light switch to open a door instead of turning on the light.

17
00:00:48,325 --> 00:00:53,207
Or you can set a security camera to open a trap door instead of setting an alarm.

18
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,348
Or you can set a light switch to trigger an alarm.

19
00:00:55,368 --> 00:00:58,210
I don't know why you would, but you could do that.

20
00:00:58,230 --> 00:00:59,710
So, that was...

21
00:01:01,922 --> 00:01:03,862
Also you've got to play with upwinders a lot

22
00:01:05,282 --> 00:01:06,623
and punch people in the face repeatedly.

23
00:01:07,863 --> 00:01:08,963
Those aren't the integral

24
00:01:09,283 --> 00:01:10,603
concepts behind the game but they did

25
00:01:11,043 --> 00:01:12,524
go a long way to making people like it.

26
00:01:14,624 --> 00:01:15,844
When I started it

27
00:01:16,485 --> 00:01:20,886
I had done some programming in school but I'd forgotten all of it and it was

28
00:01:20,906 --> 00:01:22,406
in Visual Basic so it was completely

29
00:01:22,946 --> 00:01:27,287
irrelevant to game making as far as I know. I certainly couldn't remember a line of code.

30
00:01:27,307 --> 00:01:28,107
I'd completely forgotten all of it.

31
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:30,923
I didn't know what I was doing, I'd never made a game before.

32
00:01:32,385 --> 00:01:35,811
And I didn't have a game budget, I had my life savings,

33
00:01:35,871 --> 00:01:37,894
and I spent a chunk of that to come to GDC one year.

34
00:01:38,074 --> 00:01:40,218
But other than that, there weren't any major expenses for the game.

35
00:01:41,465 --> 00:01:42,606
$30 to buy GameMaker.

36
00:01:44,307 --> 00:01:45,628
And I only worked on my weekends,

37
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:47,109
and that's kind of the important one,

38
00:01:47,149 --> 00:01:49,750
because the title of this talk is

39
00:01:51,051 --> 00:01:52,752
Lessons Learned Making Gunpoint Quickly,

40
00:01:53,132 --> 00:01:54,193
and Gunpoint took three years.

41
00:01:55,174 --> 00:01:56,334
And Gunpoint is only three hours long,

42
00:01:56,435 --> 00:01:58,476
so that's not like a great rate in calendar years,

43
00:01:58,996 --> 00:02:00,157
but I was only working on my weekends.

44
00:02:00,177 --> 00:02:02,579
I was doing a full-time job while I was making it,

45
00:02:02,739 --> 00:02:04,180
so I was a writer for PC Gamer at the time.

46
00:02:06,421 --> 00:02:09,102
I my best guess is probably about a year full-time

47
00:02:09,122 --> 00:02:10,782
development equivalent to.

48
00:02:11,762 --> 00:02:13,683
And since I was also learning how to make games in that time

49
00:02:14,083 --> 00:02:16,043
I feel like that's relatively quick for what it is.

50
00:02:16,763 --> 00:02:20,444
And in particular it's good because it succeeded on pretty

51
00:02:20,484 --> 00:02:21,544
much every level I cared about.

52
00:02:22,025 --> 00:02:23,925
So it sold well enough for me to quit that job.

53
00:02:24,185 --> 00:02:26,406
I was able to leave PC Gamer and become a full-time indie

54
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,906
developer, which I have been for the last, it's been nearly

55
00:02:29,146 --> 00:02:31,107
two years now since it came out.

56
00:02:32,147 --> 00:02:34,507
And it went down really well in the press, got really good

57
00:02:34,547 --> 00:02:34,747
reviews.

58
00:02:36,548 --> 00:02:38,049
I'm happy with it, which is quite important.

59
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,671
We've been porting it to Mac and Linux.

60
00:02:43,074 --> 00:02:45,475
took nearly a year after launching it

61
00:02:46,336 --> 00:02:48,757
and during that process, that was done externally

62
00:02:48,797 --> 00:02:51,720
but I was having to test, obviously to check that the build was coming along OK

63
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:52,980
and you could still play through the game

64
00:02:53,481 --> 00:02:56,583
and this is after having spent 3 years making it, which also involved a lot of testing

65
00:02:57,223 --> 00:02:59,385
and every time I needed to test a new build, I was like

66
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,586
oh god, I can't face playing it again

67
00:03:02,067 --> 00:03:03,828
and then as soon as I started it up, it would be like

68
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:06,170
oh yeah, this is quite good, I quite like this

69
00:03:06,985 --> 00:03:08,726
And I think pretty much every time I've played it through,

70
00:03:09,266 --> 00:03:10,626
something has happened that's never happened before

71
00:03:10,666 --> 00:03:11,587
and has made me laugh out loud.

72
00:03:11,647 --> 00:03:13,628
So that's my personal metric for success

73
00:03:13,668 --> 00:03:14,768
in terms of me being happy with it.

74
00:03:16,249 --> 00:03:17,729
And the last one is it didn't destroy my life,

75
00:03:17,930 --> 00:03:20,711
which is often a bonus in any game development process,

76
00:03:22,071 --> 00:03:22,972
despite the fact that I was doing it

77
00:03:22,992 --> 00:03:23,992
on top of a full-time job.

78
00:03:24,032 --> 00:03:24,832
So I think it would have been easy

79
00:03:24,852 --> 00:03:26,413
to completely burn out doing that, right?

80
00:03:27,739 --> 00:03:29,020
That's why I only worked on weekends.

81
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,161
I didn't work in the evenings.

82
00:03:30,341 --> 00:03:33,223
I was trying to kind of keep some kind of sane balance

83
00:03:33,323 --> 00:03:35,185
and keep my mental health.

84
00:03:36,106 --> 00:03:38,608
So it was, it went very well

85
00:03:38,708 --> 00:03:39,809
for the amount of time that I put in.

86
00:03:40,009 --> 00:03:43,412
So that's me defending my credentials to give this talk

87
00:03:43,432 --> 00:03:46,635
because it's quite a kind of grandiose title, I think.

88
00:03:46,735 --> 00:03:47,396
I kind of regret that.

89
00:03:47,416 --> 00:03:47,456
So.

90
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:54,563
Also, the other part of the title is lessons learned making gunpoint by me

91
00:03:54,583 --> 00:03:59,268
about my process and stuff and I'd like to just sort of make sure it's clear that

92
00:03:59,308 --> 00:04:01,710
that's the tone of this, I'm not sort of trying to dictate how

93
00:04:02,210 --> 00:04:04,612
you should do everything, it's just stuff that I found useful

94
00:04:05,273 --> 00:04:07,255
and it will involve a lot of stuff that

95
00:04:10,176 --> 00:04:12,577
I learned but then kept forgetting it's kind of like

96
00:04:13,037 --> 00:04:15,978
I mean being efficient we probably already know that's a good thing right

97
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:20,140
but actually practicing that day in and day out is trickier

98
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:23,942
and there's a lot of things that it's difficult to keep reminding yourself of how to do

99
00:04:24,702 --> 00:04:27,823
these things right and so that's going to be mostly what this is about

100
00:04:28,283 --> 00:04:30,724
so when I say efficiency I'm talking about

101
00:04:31,385 --> 00:04:34,426
this value for players divided by work for developer.

102
00:04:34,866 --> 00:04:36,928
and also it's not an equation you never plug numbers into

103
00:04:37,168 --> 00:04:40,131
but it's just kind of the definition of the word in this case

104
00:04:41,032 --> 00:04:42,733
and values of the incredibly vague.

105
00:04:43,834 --> 00:04:46,997
If I was still a games journalist, I would be unhappy with using that word

106
00:04:47,077 --> 00:04:50,019
because it's too vague, but that's intentional because

107
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:53,823
I could put fun in there, but not everyone is trying to make a game that's fun

108
00:04:53,843 --> 00:04:56,105
that's not everyone's objective anymore and that's a really good thing.

109
00:04:56,445 --> 00:04:56,505
And.

110
00:04:58,958 --> 00:05:02,441
the kind of calculations you can do the sort of tricks and the

111
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:07,164
uh... the ways of thinking about uh... redesigning a game to be more efficient

112
00:05:07,284 --> 00:05:08,005
or to uh...

113
00:05:08,025 --> 00:05:10,406
uh... figure out a better process for making it

114
00:05:11,147 --> 00:05:12,528
aren't specific to making

115
00:05:12,548 --> 00:05:13,449
a game

116
00:05:13,889 --> 00:05:16,170
that's fun. They're not specific to making a game that's kind of

117
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:19,713
uh... even enjoyable. You could try and make the worst game in the world and all this

118
00:05:19,873 --> 00:05:21,654
efficiency stuff would probably still apply to

119
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:23,095
your attempts to make it terrible.

120
00:05:24,096 --> 00:05:24,857
That's probably a niche case.

121
00:05:25,867 --> 00:05:27,448
For me personally, I define value as

122
00:05:28,228 --> 00:05:29,769
it's not really fun.

123
00:05:30,329 --> 00:05:33,290
For me, I'm kind of, I always hope to make a game that's exciting,

124
00:05:33,510 --> 00:05:35,451
so I'm after a very particular kind of,

125
00:05:35,471 --> 00:05:37,852
I guess, intense fun.

126
00:05:38,613 --> 00:05:41,954
So it's kind of related to that, but I feel like fun sounds a bit narrow.

127
00:05:41,974 --> 00:05:45,596
I always imagine a really satisfying shooter when you say fun.

128
00:05:46,136 --> 00:05:47,537
And for me, I'm looking for that moment where...

129
00:05:48,328 --> 00:05:50,010
We're playing a game and you suddenly kind of

130
00:05:50,411 --> 00:05:52,313
your mind lights up when you kind of grasp

131
00:05:52,513 --> 00:05:53,314
what you can do and you're like,

132
00:05:53,334 --> 00:05:54,875
oh my god, I can do that, that's incredible.

133
00:05:55,316 --> 00:05:56,337
So that's my definition of value

134
00:05:56,357 --> 00:05:57,799
and it'll probably be different for everyone here.

135
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:00,421
But hopefully it always applies regardless.

136
00:06:00,822 --> 00:06:02,664
And work for developer, you can find that as,

137
00:06:02,884 --> 00:06:03,905
for me it was just my time.

138
00:06:05,687 --> 00:06:12,429
I did everything except the art and the music on Gunpoint, so programming and writing and design is all me.

139
00:06:12,449 --> 00:06:20,452
But obviously if you're working in a team, then other people's time also factors into that, and actual expenses, which I didn't really have to deal with.

140
00:06:21,672 --> 00:06:25,313
But yeah, that's a hopefully pretty simple concept, but it's worth just defining what we're talking about.

141
00:06:26,793 --> 00:06:30,737
So the first thing I learned was to forget about looking for good ideas.

142
00:06:30,777 --> 00:06:33,100
Like, before I started making games, when I was a journalist,

143
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,862
obviously I spent a long time analyzing them.

144
00:06:34,882 --> 00:06:37,044
I spent about nine years analyzing video games

145
00:06:37,084 --> 00:06:39,126
and trying to articulate why they were good and why they were bad.

146
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:43,802
But the thing that was missing from all of that analysis was I didn't know how it was made,

147
00:06:43,982 --> 00:06:45,443
or how difficult things were to make.

148
00:06:45,863 --> 00:06:49,144
And so I could only judge whether something was just a good idea or a bad idea.

149
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:51,545
And so I thought, well, making, like designing a good game is just

150
00:06:52,005 --> 00:06:54,106
trying to think of the best ideas, and then you make those.

151
00:06:54,366 --> 00:06:55,227
You make the best ones.

152
00:06:55,987 --> 00:06:58,908
And what I quickly learned actually trying to make one is that...

153
00:06:59,769 --> 00:07:03,772
that's it's basically impossible to consider or it's stupid to consider the

154
00:07:03,832 --> 00:07:07,896
value of an idea without considering how difficult it's going to be to make so

155
00:07:08,256 --> 00:07:08,877
just looking for the

156
00:07:09,778 --> 00:07:11,600
good ideas without considering how hard that to make

157
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:15,783
doesn't get you to the best game because you're going to have to make them it's

158
00:07:15,803 --> 00:07:16,464
going to be a real

159
00:07:16,965 --> 00:07:18,206
actual cost to it and

160
00:07:18,886 --> 00:07:20,248
and that cost will determine

161
00:07:20,788 --> 00:07:23,230
how much you can make of your game, how much you can work on it

162
00:07:23,591 --> 00:07:25,012
I think almost every game is released

163
00:07:25,592 --> 00:07:30,535
at a stage where it would have been nice to work on it a bit longer and there were things that you could have done to make it better

164
00:07:31,355 --> 00:07:34,296
and so efficiency is about maximizing that, it's about

165
00:07:35,957 --> 00:07:39,599
figuring out how to do the most good in the shortest amount of time

166
00:07:40,119 --> 00:07:42,200
and it's up to you which one of those you want to optimize, like

167
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:46,502
all these things could be used to take the same amount of time to make a better game

168
00:07:46,722 --> 00:07:50,664
or they could be used to make a game of the same quality in less time or some combination thereof

169
00:07:52,636 --> 00:07:55,257
So to illustrate, I'm going to talk about Heat Signature a little bit.

170
00:07:55,297 --> 00:07:56,238
This is what I'm working on now.

171
00:07:56,278 --> 00:07:56,958
This is my next game.

172
00:07:58,298 --> 00:08:01,020
It is a top-down space game.

173
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:02,500
You're flying through this infinite galaxy.

174
00:08:03,341 --> 00:08:07,142
You are encountering all these randomly generated ships, and if you dock with one, you go inside,

175
00:08:07,162 --> 00:08:09,283
and then you see all the crew walking around.

176
00:08:09,343 --> 00:08:13,865
You can hit them with a wrench, as I just did there, and I think I'm about to...

177
00:08:13,885 --> 00:08:15,006
Oh yeah, so that guy's gone.

178
00:08:15,226 --> 00:08:18,847
Then I smack him in the face with the wrench, and you're trying to like...

179
00:08:19,271 --> 00:08:22,493
either steal something, or in this case I'm trying to assassinate that guy who's circled in red.

180
00:08:24,555 --> 00:08:28,257
And it's all about kind of like these randomly generated ships and their systems.

181
00:08:28,677 --> 00:08:32,840
And when I shoot this guy, my bullet hits the fuel barrel, it blows up part of the ship,

182
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:37,924
we get sucked out into space from the vacuum, and then I remote control my pod to come and pick myself up

183
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,666
so that I can go about on my next mission.

184
00:08:41,326 --> 00:08:45,609
So it's a big kind of randomly generated, it's going to be kind of a roguelike type thing.

185
00:08:47,375 --> 00:08:48,936
I think I'm just about to catch myself, yeah.

186
00:08:49,437 --> 00:08:51,438
So that's it, I'm back to the start now.

187
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:56,402
And something people often say in the comments and the videos of this on YouTube and stuff is

188
00:08:56,422 --> 00:08:58,103
Hey, you should have planets you can land on in this game.

189
00:08:58,743 --> 00:09:00,645
And I agree, that's a really good idea.

190
00:09:00,865 --> 00:09:02,426
That's a thing that would add a lot to the game.

191
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:05,268
It would be a major change in scope and context.

192
00:09:05,328 --> 00:09:08,530
It would be a huge deal if there were planets that you could fly up to and land on.

193
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:10,651
That would really massively expand the scope of the game.

194
00:09:11,072 --> 00:09:12,392
it is a good idea for heat signature.

195
00:09:13,393 --> 00:09:14,793
But my best guess is it would probably take

196
00:09:14,833 --> 00:09:16,274
about five weeks to make.

197
00:09:16,654 --> 00:09:17,995
I mean, it's really, really hard to guess,

198
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:19,375
and I'll talk about later about

199
00:09:19,795 --> 00:09:21,016
how to deal with that uncertainty.

200
00:09:21,596 --> 00:09:23,477
But I've given it some thought,

201
00:09:23,497 --> 00:09:25,558
and I think it's such a huge thing

202
00:09:25,858 --> 00:09:27,359
that it would take that amount of time.

203
00:09:27,719 --> 00:09:29,339
I think most of the first week would just be thinking,

204
00:09:29,379 --> 00:09:31,220
how the hell do I do this?

205
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,041
It might involve compromising the...

206
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,542
the actual kind of some of the things I'm going for with the game which is

207
00:09:37,742 --> 00:09:40,365
kind of consistency like you saw when I boarded that ship

208
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,507
we didn't change into a boarding mode or anything the camera stays where it is

209
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:47,010
you just zoom in a little bit and it's all one game so landing on a planet a

210
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:50,933
planet would consume you know the entire game world you

211
00:09:50,953 --> 00:09:54,156
couldn't ever see it on one screen except by zooming out absurdly it would

212
00:09:54,176 --> 00:09:57,058
just be extremely difficult to integrate so it's a good idea but it's very very

213
00:09:57,098 --> 00:09:59,640
difficult and if I was going to spend five weeks

214
00:09:59,701 --> 00:10:01,522
on something which I am because I'm still working on this game

215
00:10:02,883 --> 00:10:06,147
I would much rather do something like this bunch of stuff.

216
00:10:06,828 --> 00:10:09,811
And this is a lot of ideas where each individual one

217
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:13,015
is not as good an idea as having planets

218
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:13,636
that you can land on.

219
00:10:14,036 --> 00:10:16,939
They're all just a bit more modest in their scope.

220
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:18,999
they're all

221
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,380
less ambitious, they just don't really

222
00:10:21,780 --> 00:10:25,042
amount to, or each individual one doesn't make such a

223
00:10:25,502 --> 00:10:26,582
huge difference to the game.

224
00:10:27,263 --> 00:10:28,163
The first one here is

225
00:10:28,763 --> 00:10:29,864
in this time I could add

226
00:10:30,324 --> 00:10:32,364
space stations that you can dock with, I do plan to do that.

227
00:10:33,445 --> 00:10:33,765
And that

228
00:10:34,405 --> 00:10:37,386
actually fulfills a lot of the goals of adding planets, like I think when someone

229
00:10:37,587 --> 00:10:39,107
says they would like planets in the heat signature

230
00:10:39,507 --> 00:10:42,068
they're kind of probably responding to the fact that it seems like a big

231
00:10:42,188 --> 00:10:45,770
mishmash of random stuff floating around in infinite space which is completely

232
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:46,090
accurate.

233
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:52,144
and having space stations that are like at fixed locations that you can dock with and you can go

234
00:10:52,184 --> 00:10:56,589
aboard and like go to a shop and you know restock your supplies buy new upgrades um get a new

235
00:10:56,629 --> 00:11:01,414
mission from some kind of job listings board um that actually i think checks a lot of those boxes

236
00:11:01,454 --> 00:11:03,856
i think it make it will give the galaxy a kind of feeling of

237
00:11:04,277 --> 00:11:09,199
geography, there will be places that are important to you, there will be a home base of some kind.

238
00:11:09,659 --> 00:11:13,861
And so it does a lot of things that a planet would do, but because it's a space station, it's man-made,

239
00:11:14,141 --> 00:11:17,222
and that means space stations basically look a bit like spaceships.

240
00:11:17,562 --> 00:11:21,704
And I already generate spaceships, so I can use all the same kind of ship generation algorithms

241
00:11:21,744 --> 00:11:23,644
to make a space station of some kind.

242
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,305
I'll have to tweak them a little bit, so it'll take about a week.

243
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:28,668
but it's not a a massive massive job

244
00:11:29,129 --> 00:11:31,431
and because i think it's weak and i think it's five weeks

245
00:11:31,831 --> 00:11:34,514
i don't want to lose other stuff so i can have randomly generated weapons i can

246
00:11:34,554 --> 00:11:35,415
do upgrades for ship

247
00:11:35,955 --> 00:11:39,239
i can uh... given to your doors to the ships that you can mess with so you get

248
00:11:39,259 --> 00:11:42,081
to a central computer and then you can like me but those doors to seal them in

249
00:11:42,121 --> 00:11:42,782
locker garden

250
00:11:43,463 --> 00:11:46,886
and i cannot hold galaxy maps you can keep zooming out and see what stations

251
00:11:47,086 --> 00:11:48,267
are in a sense for the kind of

252
00:11:48,828 --> 00:11:52,551
the geography and that like the context for your missions and I could create

253
00:11:52,591 --> 00:11:56,334
factions that all these ships belong to and the factions would fight each other

254
00:11:56,374 --> 00:11:59,016
on site and you'd be working for some factions and trying to undermine the

255
00:11:59,036 --> 00:12:03,799
others this is like a large chunk of everything I have left to do on the game

256
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:07,262
and it still doesn't add up to being as big and difficult a thing as the

257
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:10,424
planets thing so these are a bunch of small efficient ideas

258
00:12:11,493 --> 00:12:14,697
and they make the game better than the one big good idea.

259
00:12:14,917 --> 00:12:16,840
Even though the idea is better than each of these individual things.

260
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:19,023
And I think when I say, if I just say it in abstract,

261
00:12:19,043 --> 00:12:20,885
the reason I've gotten into a lot of detail on this is that

262
00:12:21,085 --> 00:12:23,648
if I just say in the abstract it's better

263
00:12:24,089 --> 00:12:25,811
to work on a lot of little efficient ideas

264
00:12:25,851 --> 00:12:27,693
than it is to work on one big one, in a lot of cases,

265
00:12:28,114 --> 00:12:28,995
of one big good idea.

266
00:12:29,596 --> 00:12:31,497
then it sounds like I'm saying be less ambitious.

267
00:12:31,657 --> 00:12:33,539
It sounds like I'm saying don't, you know,

268
00:12:33,599 --> 00:12:35,621
shoot for the moon, don't try and make your game amazing,

269
00:12:35,681 --> 00:12:36,882
just try and make quite a good game.

270
00:12:37,242 --> 00:12:38,183
And that's not at all what I'm saying.

271
00:12:38,223 --> 00:12:39,544
I'm saying make a much better game.

272
00:12:39,604 --> 00:12:41,445
Make a really incredibly exciting,

273
00:12:41,505 --> 00:12:44,688
complicated, amazing thing by focusing on efficient ideas

274
00:12:44,708 --> 00:12:45,649
because they will make you,

275
00:12:46,089 --> 00:12:47,350
they will make your game more ambitious

276
00:12:48,151 --> 00:12:49,692
without actually increasing the amount of

277
00:12:50,973 --> 00:12:52,154
difficulty of creating it.

278
00:12:56,598 --> 00:12:57,519
So when you're trying to judge

279
00:12:58,887 --> 00:13:02,689
whether idea is valuable and how its value relates to how

280
00:13:02,709 --> 00:13:05,430
difficult it's going to be to make. Like I say, value is very vague.

281
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:10,713
If we were to take fun, for example, then

282
00:13:11,193 --> 00:13:14,695
when you consider some idea you're thinking about making, and you probably have an

283
00:13:14,735 --> 00:13:17,117
idea of how fun it will be to do once.

284
00:13:17,437 --> 00:13:20,298
When you experience this thing, it will be this much fun. Landing on a planet will be

285
00:13:20,318 --> 00:13:21,279
this exciting. Or

286
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:25,561
going around these space stations I'm thinking about adding.

287
00:13:26,802 --> 00:13:27,942
This will be this good.

288
00:13:28,923 --> 00:13:31,027
that's probably the intuitive thing. I think that's the part where

289
00:13:31,528 --> 00:13:33,692
that's what we think of when we think about estimating the value of an idea

290
00:13:34,133 --> 00:13:35,496
but there are some other considerations like

291
00:13:36,378 --> 00:13:38,121
how many times will one player get value out of it?

292
00:13:38,462 --> 00:13:39,544
Like if you're going to have

293
00:13:41,091 --> 00:13:45,713
if you're making like a sort of scripted encounter where you're like the player

294
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:50,275
character in some game is fighting a boss and they're gonna it's gonna be a

295
00:13:50,295 --> 00:13:52,837
shitty quick time event and you're gonna press triangle to punch the boss in the

296
00:13:52,877 --> 00:13:56,699
face and you're working on like how satisfying that punching the guy in the

297
00:13:56,719 --> 00:14:00,961
faces then it's worth thinking about how many times is the player actually going

298
00:14:00,981 --> 00:14:03,583
to experience this probably just once if it's a actual plot moment

299
00:14:04,063 --> 00:14:07,324
but if that's part of a you know take down that you do in that kind of game

300
00:14:07,344 --> 00:14:09,966
uh... where every time you attack an enemy you're going to be doing that punch

301
00:14:10,046 --> 00:14:12,727
then one player is going to experience it hundreds of times perhaps

302
00:14:14,928 --> 00:14:15,608
the next one is

303
00:14:15,628 --> 00:14:17,649
how many players will experience it

304
00:14:18,349 --> 00:14:20,230
and this one there's some kind of uh...

305
00:14:20,811 --> 00:14:22,511
this might be slightly controversial

306
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:29,698
I can imagine my friend Jim Crawford who makes frog fractions giving a whole talk about the

307
00:14:29,738 --> 00:14:30,779
opposite of what I'm about to say.

308
00:14:31,759 --> 00:14:37,021
But I think it's worth at least knowing, at least thinking about how many people are going

309
00:14:37,041 --> 00:14:37,622
to experience the thing.

310
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:44,045
So if that punch moment that I was talking about was taking place on the critical path

311
00:14:44,325 --> 00:14:45,385
then like in the main.

312
00:14:45,975 --> 00:14:47,996
threat of the game, the thing that every player is going to encounter,

313
00:14:48,456 --> 00:14:50,797
then that's all of the players, that's the most.

314
00:14:51,337 --> 00:14:54,078
If it's something that only happens if you happen to open like a secret door

315
00:14:54,098 --> 00:14:56,099
and then a guy ambushes you and that's when the punch occurs,

316
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:58,620
then only a tiny percentage of players are going to

317
00:14:58,900 --> 00:14:59,500
experience that.

318
00:14:59,880 --> 00:15:02,642
And that doesn't mean it's not valuable, it can still be worth putting a bunch of effort

319
00:15:02,682 --> 00:15:05,483
into something that's very, only a few people will find.

320
00:15:05,783 --> 00:15:08,044
But if you're going to do that, that value value, sorry,

321
00:15:08,164 --> 00:15:11,005
that value will have to be much greater.

322
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:14,208
If you're going to work on something that only 1% of players are going to see,

323
00:15:14,408 --> 00:15:15,249
it better be fucking great.

324
00:15:15,329 --> 00:15:18,492
They better talk about it to everybody they meet.

325
00:15:19,113 --> 00:15:24,117
And they'll be more excited about it if they know that they were in the 1% who experienced it.

326
00:15:24,618 --> 00:15:26,480
But it's still going to have to be memorable.

327
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:28,462
It can't just be punching a guy in the face.

328
00:15:29,263 --> 00:15:30,544
So, I guess it could be.

329
00:15:31,205 --> 00:15:32,486
But that's probably not the best way to do it.

330
00:15:33,567 --> 00:15:36,249
And then the last one is, is it the type of value you care about creating?

331
00:15:36,309 --> 00:15:38,311
So I talked earlier about what those types of value might be.

332
00:15:38,491 --> 00:15:39,592
Like for me, it's excitement.

333
00:15:40,112 --> 00:15:43,715
I really care about stuff that, like I say, opens your mind up to possibilities

334
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:45,396
and makes you think, oh wow, I didn't realize I could do that.

335
00:15:46,796 --> 00:15:48,657
suddenly kind of, I love that moment when like

336
00:15:49,278 --> 00:15:51,999
the mechanics that you've learned kind of flower in your mind

337
00:15:52,099 --> 00:15:53,780
and you can kind of grasp how

338
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:56,342
how much freedom and creativity they give you

339
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,003
but you haven't quite thought it through yet

340
00:15:58,103 --> 00:15:59,344
so it seems kind of magical

341
00:15:59,364 --> 00:16:00,865
because you don't understand it yet. I love that.

342
00:16:01,425 --> 00:16:03,166
So that's the type of value I care most about creating.

343
00:16:03,586 --> 00:16:04,367
But gunpoint was full of

344
00:16:06,228 --> 00:16:11,991
uh... it was a the story gunpoint is a kind of noire tale about uh... betrayal

345
00:16:12,091 --> 00:16:14,532
corporate espionage murder affairs

346
00:16:15,273 --> 00:16:17,874
uh... and then when you play it you're opening a door in someone's face to knock

347
00:16:17,894 --> 00:16:19,775
them out and it's basically slapstick

348
00:16:20,275 --> 00:16:22,136
and so it's got slapstick in it it's got uh...

349
00:16:22,636 --> 00:16:23,077
it's got

350
00:16:23,937 --> 00:16:26,899
uh... quite a serious plot and it's got a lot of different types of things that

351
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:30,500
are kind of tonally quite incongruous but they were all things i liked, they were all things i

352
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:32,181
cared about so i worked on those things

353
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,022
and hopefully they kind of fit together

354
00:16:36,982 --> 00:16:38,883
So I've been talking quite

355
00:16:40,484 --> 00:16:44,787
in quite a black and white terms about value and how long things are going to take

356
00:16:45,367 --> 00:16:49,430
and if you've actually worked on a game, you know that these things are by no means certain.

357
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:53,732
You often have very little idea ahead of time how hard something is going to be

358
00:16:53,752 --> 00:16:58,435
and sometimes you don't know how good something is going to be when you're thinking about a feature or some addition.

359
00:16:59,015 --> 00:17:00,776
it's difficult to know how much it will add.

360
00:17:01,017 --> 00:17:03,818
Sometimes it's difficult to know how hard it will be.

361
00:17:04,278 --> 00:17:05,619
Sometimes it's difficult to know either.

362
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,401
So, obviously you have to deal with that.

363
00:17:08,781 --> 00:17:09,561
The way this is written,

364
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:11,462
that's the most facile thing I've ever said.

365
00:17:11,482 --> 00:17:15,004
But what I'm hopefully going to explain

366
00:17:15,144 --> 00:17:17,125
is how to deal with uncertainty, how to factor it in.

367
00:17:17,906 --> 00:17:21,168
So, if you have an idea that you are pretty sure...

368
00:17:21,910 --> 00:17:24,311
it's going to be good you can sure it's going to add something it's going to be

369
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:25,471
an exciting addition to the game.

370
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:29,213
But you're not sure whether it's going to be easy to do you know it's going to

371
00:17:29,233 --> 00:17:29,533
be quick.

372
00:17:30,473 --> 00:17:30,773
Then.

373
00:17:32,794 --> 00:17:35,575
What I kind of the conclusion I came to is that you just try it just give it a

374
00:17:35,615 --> 00:17:38,856
day or whatever period of time seems appropriate to explore it to see if it

375
00:17:39,397 --> 00:17:42,618
how hard it really is and then you'll have more data on.

376
00:17:44,955 --> 00:17:47,138
the size of the task, like how complex it's going to be.

377
00:17:47,459 --> 00:17:50,003
You probably won't know everything about how long it's going to take,

378
00:17:50,043 --> 00:17:51,625
it won't give you certainty about that,

379
00:17:52,086 --> 00:17:54,951
but it will give you a lot more information to work with

380
00:17:54,971 --> 00:17:56,473
and you'll have a much better idea of whether it's worth it.

381
00:17:56,894 --> 00:17:57,835
So my example for this is...

382
00:17:58,998 --> 00:18:02,899
come on. I'm going to be back so it's my voice.

383
00:18:04,660 --> 00:18:07,841
And I knew come was going to be short and you I can make about

384
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:10,321
20 levels in the time I had I don't know a strict deadline,

385
00:18:10,342 --> 00:18:12,762
but I didn't want to spend years and years making hundreds levels.

386
00:18:14,123 --> 00:18:16,303
So I knew the game was probably going to be about 3 hours long

387
00:18:16,684 --> 00:18:19,224
I knew people complain about that and I want to shut them up.

388
00:18:19,985 --> 00:18:23,246
So I thought about I knew it would be great if I could have

389
00:18:23,266 --> 00:18:25,887
a level and you that would really kind of just make it.

390
00:18:26,581 --> 00:18:29,164
harder to criticize gunpoint for being short people still

391
00:18:29,184 --> 00:18:32,367
would I knew they still would but I wanted the line

392
00:18:32,387 --> 00:18:34,830
in the review that says gunpoint is too short to change

393
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,631
to gunpoint is too short but as a level it's

394
00:18:37,052 --> 00:18:39,094
because then it's a positive you see.

395
00:18:39,594 --> 00:18:41,476
So I knew it would be it would be massive

396
00:18:41,516 --> 00:18:43,518
if I could do it be a really huge win but

397
00:18:44,499 --> 00:18:46,942
I would like to say as a novice coder I was barely

398
00:18:47,042 --> 00:18:48,243
keeping it together making a game.

399
00:18:49,380 --> 00:18:52,702
So the idea of making a level editor was actually pretty daunting, because now you're making an application.

400
00:18:52,742 --> 00:18:57,645
You're making a piece of software that essentially creates a kind of document

401
00:18:57,745 --> 00:19:00,647
and saves it in a new file format that I would have to invent.

402
00:19:00,667 --> 00:19:04,109
And it would have to have an interface and buttons and stuff.

403
00:19:04,549 --> 00:19:06,570
And so it was daunting and very, very uncertain.

404
00:19:06,750 --> 00:19:09,652
I knew it would be good. I was very uncertain about whether it would be possible,

405
00:19:09,712 --> 00:19:11,113
whether it would be quick, whether it would be feasible.

406
00:19:11,593 --> 00:19:14,855
whether I could do it in an amount of time that would actually make sense and be possible for me to do.

407
00:19:16,175 --> 00:19:17,416
So I just, I did, I took a day.

408
00:19:17,436 --> 00:19:23,979
It was a Sunday. I decided to just try making a level editor, just jump straight into it.

409
00:19:24,039 --> 00:19:27,801
I had a pretty, I had this kind of idea for how those buttons would be laid out and stuff,

410
00:19:27,821 --> 00:19:31,303
just sort of rough concept of what form this level editor might take,

411
00:19:31,703 --> 00:19:34,384
and this thing where you kind of drag and drop items from the...

412
00:19:35,770 --> 00:19:37,111
from the interface into the world

413
00:19:37,531 --> 00:19:38,952
that was kind of stolen from Portal 2,

414
00:19:39,232 --> 00:19:40,073
sorry, yeah, Portal 2.

415
00:19:40,773 --> 00:19:41,854
When they added a level editor to that,

416
00:19:41,874 --> 00:19:43,936
it had this really lovely, intuitive feeling

417
00:19:43,956 --> 00:19:45,557
of just picking stuff up and plonking it down.

418
00:19:47,178 --> 00:19:49,720
And at the end of that day, I had...

419
00:19:50,710 --> 00:19:54,032
it working basically i had the buttons they had the sprites for the from the

420
00:19:54,072 --> 00:19:56,773
objects the represented i can click on them i can drag them into the world and

421
00:19:56,953 --> 00:19:57,493
and just worked

422
00:19:58,613 --> 00:20:01,614
it was by no means a finish level editor and i had about five things you could

423
00:20:01,654 --> 00:20:01,894
place

424
00:20:03,175 --> 00:20:06,476
but i could save them to disk like as a kind of text file essentially

425
00:20:06,796 --> 00:20:09,597
the text files are just lists of all the objects in the level and they just say where

426
00:20:09,637 --> 00:20:09,937
they go

427
00:20:09,957 --> 00:20:13,999
uh... so it's incredibly primitive but it worked and so i knew then

428
00:20:14,779 --> 00:20:17,561
I still don't know how long it would take, but I had a pretty good sense that

429
00:20:17,721 --> 00:20:20,463
oh, this is doable. If I can make something that roughly works in a day,

430
00:20:20,703 --> 00:20:23,625
I can make the whole thing in some kind of reasonable amount of time.

431
00:20:24,606 --> 00:20:29,129
I'm going to let this play out because I really like the solution to the level I made here,

432
00:20:29,689 --> 00:20:33,372
which is to smash the window, and then the guy hears the sound, runs upstairs,

433
00:20:33,752 --> 00:20:35,993
walks to the motion detector, which you've wired to the door, and then you get in.

434
00:20:41,037 --> 00:20:41,577
The level editor.

435
00:20:42,893 --> 00:20:45,314
The question was, did I make the level editor in GameMaker? Yes, I did.

436
00:20:45,755 --> 00:20:48,217
In fact, I made the levels in Gunpoint

437
00:20:48,677 --> 00:20:49,257
in GameMaker,

438
00:20:49,578 --> 00:20:52,340
and then at the end I did the level editor because it was a lower priority thing,

439
00:20:52,740 --> 00:20:54,301
and I made that in GameMaker as well,

440
00:20:54,982 --> 00:20:55,282
and

441
00:20:55,942 --> 00:20:58,064
it was way better than GameMaker's level editor.

442
00:20:58,885 --> 00:21:00,966
For Gunpoint at least, it's much better to use.

443
00:21:01,967 --> 00:21:04,609
And so like, shit, why didn't I do this first? Because then I could have made the levels in it.

444
00:21:07,235 --> 00:21:19,731
So the other possibility is what if you're certain that the thing will be easy, but you don't know how good it will be so that the value of it is the unknown, but you're pretty sure you know how to do it. It's similar to something you've done before an example for this would be.

445
00:21:21,906 --> 00:21:24,807
come when I was going to pause that so I don't know before so

446
00:21:25,828 --> 00:21:28,969
okay, let's play. Come point has a load of gadgets that you can

447
00:21:28,989 --> 00:21:32,270
buy like upgrades to get it so you buy between missions.

448
00:21:33,271 --> 00:21:37,072
And most of them optional the things that you can buy if you

449
00:21:37,112 --> 00:21:40,054
want and they will change your play style will facilitate

450
00:21:40,074 --> 00:21:42,695
different ways of playing the game and setting up that shop

451
00:21:42,735 --> 00:21:45,516
was a challenge setting up the inventory system was kind of a

452
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:48,457
challenge. But then once I designed like.

453
00:21:48,897 --> 00:21:51,400
a gadget, I think maybe one of the first ones he did was

454
00:21:51,861 --> 00:21:54,503
the hushcracker, which lets you jump through a window silently,

455
00:21:54,643 --> 00:21:56,726
so you still smash the window, but it kind of muffles the noise.

456
00:21:58,427 --> 00:22:00,910
Once I'd done that, I kind of knew, oh, that's how long a gadget takes.

457
00:22:00,970 --> 00:22:03,773
It takes like maybe a day in total,

458
00:22:03,913 --> 00:22:06,816
which is very quick and very easy, and they add a lot to the game.

459
00:22:07,236 --> 00:22:09,158
They let you kind of tailor your play style.

460
00:22:09,999 --> 00:22:10,940
And then I was watching...

461
00:22:12,793 --> 00:22:16,574
a talk by Jonathan Blow and Mark Ten Bosch and they were talking about their kind of

462
00:22:17,454 --> 00:22:20,615
design philosophy and kind of describing the way they approach

463
00:22:20,875 --> 00:22:23,675
making games and sort of taking out some principles that they think are kind of

464
00:22:24,155 --> 00:22:27,696
generally a good idea and the one Jonathan Blow was talking about was

465
00:22:29,196 --> 00:22:32,037
interconnectedness. When you have a bunch of game mechanics in your game

466
00:22:32,777 --> 00:22:36,317
you should think about having them talk to each other in some way, having them link to

467
00:22:36,337 --> 00:22:36,638
each other

468
00:22:37,078 --> 00:22:40,718
and I was thinking what are the elements of gunpoint? Like guns and rewiring stuff

469
00:22:41,018 --> 00:22:41,898
how can I mesh those together?

470
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:43,159
well you could rewire guns

471
00:22:44,499 --> 00:22:47,120
and so I tried making a gadget that would do that

472
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:51,181
and I couldn't, it seemed exciting but I had no idea really like how would that

473
00:22:51,301 --> 00:22:55,103
work, what would it be like, what would it really add to the game, would it just totally break the game

474
00:22:55,143 --> 00:22:57,924
because if you could wire a light switch to somebody's gun and then just flick that to make them

475
00:22:57,964 --> 00:22:58,904
shoot their friend then

476
00:23:00,044 --> 00:23:01,125
that seems kind of disastrous

477
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:07,295
I just did it because I knew gadgets are easy, you can do them in like a day

478
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:09,657
making this upgrade is going to be pretty simple

479
00:23:10,197 --> 00:23:11,558
and I don't know how good it's going to be

480
00:23:12,059 --> 00:23:13,300
and so I tried it and

481
00:23:14,040 --> 00:23:15,421
in this video I've just

482
00:23:16,682 --> 00:23:20,205
first I rewired that guy's gun to the light so he couldn't shoot me. If you wire a gun to something

483
00:23:20,505 --> 00:23:22,487
it triggers that thing when the guy tries to fire

484
00:23:23,027 --> 00:23:24,108
if you wire something to a gun

485
00:23:24,588 --> 00:23:26,170
then when it's triggered the gun goes off

486
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:30,153
so what I'm doing here is I'm going to wire that front guard's gun

487
00:23:30,693 --> 00:23:31,574
to the guy behind him

488
00:23:32,224 --> 00:23:35,146
When he tries to fire, it won't fire, it'll trigger what it's linked to.

489
00:23:35,446 --> 00:23:37,207
What it's linked to is the gun pointing at the back of his head,

490
00:23:37,627 --> 00:23:39,208
so he's going to shoot himself in the back of the head.

491
00:23:42,870 --> 00:23:44,111
Let me see if it actually happens, ever.

492
00:23:46,892 --> 00:23:48,753
I'm saying exactly what I just said on this video.

493
00:23:49,113 --> 00:23:50,194
That's why I'm not doing it right away.

494
00:23:50,214 --> 00:23:51,655
Okay, here we go.

495
00:23:54,736 --> 00:23:55,097
And that's it.

496
00:23:57,738 --> 00:23:57,958
Thanks.

497
00:23:59,761 --> 00:24:02,965
Here is everything I just said in graph form.

498
00:24:03,686 --> 00:24:07,371
So if you're certain something will be quick,

499
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:09,254
but you're not certain it'll be good, then try it.

500
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,856
If you're certain it'll be good,

501
00:24:10,896 --> 00:24:12,719
but you're not sure it'll be quick, then give it a day.

502
00:24:15,907 --> 00:24:17,929
you know, see how long, how hard it is going to be.

503
00:24:19,611 --> 00:24:22,134
If you're certain it will be quick and you're certain it will be good, of course just make it.

504
00:24:22,935 --> 00:24:25,797
And if you're not sure of either of those things, then just forget about it because

505
00:24:26,518 --> 00:24:29,321
you're a game designer, so you can probably think, do better than that, right?

506
00:24:29,341 --> 00:24:32,684
You can probably do better than the idea that you don't know will be good and you don't know if it'll be easy.

507
00:24:35,007 --> 00:24:37,670
I think also on the point about uncertain value.

508
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:44,124
uncertain time, the outliers for that are going to be the things that take years, right?

509
00:24:44,144 --> 00:24:47,169
The things where it seems like, oh yeah, that should be doable, and then when you actually

510
00:24:48,210 --> 00:24:50,835
try and do it, it just goes on and on and on, and it never quite...

511
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:52,773
never quite works.

512
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,934
For Uncertain Value, I think the outliers are

513
00:24:57,514 --> 00:24:59,115
the ideas that turn out to be amazing.

514
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:00,275
That long shot thing,

515
00:25:01,535 --> 00:25:02,556
as you can see, it's pretty funny.

516
00:25:03,456 --> 00:25:06,957
It also led to, like, maybe

517
00:25:07,017 --> 00:25:09,778
70% of all of my favorite moments in Gunpoint. Like, all of the best stories

518
00:25:09,838 --> 00:25:13,479
about crazy things that you can rewire, crazy traps you can set up, crazy

519
00:25:13,859 --> 00:25:14,680
like, stunts to pull off.

520
00:25:15,100 --> 00:25:17,941
It led to a huge amount of those. It was a massive addition to the game. It really,

521
00:25:17,981 --> 00:25:19,481
really made it loads better, in my opinion.

522
00:25:21,062 --> 00:25:30,408
And so that's why stuff that, where you're uncertain about the value, it's worth just biting the bullet and making it, and spending the time, as long as it's not a huge amount.

523
00:25:32,889 --> 00:25:34,790
So the third thing I learned was the art of not doing things.

524
00:25:38,473 --> 00:25:39,553
This is a screenshot from Gone Home.

525
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:43,076
And if I show you three screenshots from Gone Home, um...

526
00:25:44,195 --> 00:25:47,577
Gone Home is a story about a young girl coming of age,

527
00:25:47,597 --> 00:25:49,338
kind of discovering her sexuality,

528
00:25:49,818 --> 00:25:52,300
and kind of learning her place in the world.

529
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:53,740
And it's a story about relationships.

530
00:25:54,141 --> 00:25:56,862
It's a very sweet, and sometimes funny, and touching story

531
00:25:57,242 --> 00:25:59,383
about people and their relationships to each other.

532
00:26:00,204 --> 00:26:02,065
And there's something missing in these shots.

533
00:26:02,445 --> 00:26:03,185
There's no people in it.

534
00:26:04,353 --> 00:26:08,276
they decided to not do people in a game that's entirely about people there are

535
00:26:08,296 --> 00:26:13,999
no people in it it's incredible how often we don't consider just leaving

536
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:17,881
something out and it's really easy to assume that something has to be in there

537
00:26:17,921 --> 00:26:20,482
like it's just so integral to the whole thing that you're doing but of course

538
00:26:20,502 --> 00:26:24,684
you need people in a story about people but you don't gone home is amazing and

539
00:26:24,824 --> 00:26:31,388
it tells that story really sensitively and brilliantly and for my own example

540
00:26:32,573 --> 00:26:34,690
Something I should have considered not doing for gunpoint is the gun.

541
00:26:35,940 --> 00:26:38,402
That was a thing that perhaps understandably I was

542
00:26:38,422 --> 00:26:40,584
assumed well that kind of needs to be in there, the gun right?

543
00:26:40,624 --> 00:26:41,364
It's called gunpoint.

544
00:26:42,745 --> 00:26:44,566
When I first, when I came up with that name,

545
00:26:44,626 --> 00:26:46,768
I was thinking it would be much more about holding people

546
00:26:46,788 --> 00:26:47,208
at gunpoint.

547
00:26:48,469 --> 00:26:50,891
So in the game you can, later on you can buy a gun

548
00:26:51,211 --> 00:26:52,292
and it costs a huge amount of money.

549
00:26:53,693 --> 00:26:56,314
And you only get six bullets for it ever.

550
00:26:56,675 --> 00:26:57,655
You can't buy any new ones.

551
00:26:59,176 --> 00:27:00,677
And people love that though.

552
00:27:01,278 --> 00:27:02,699
Totally accepting and understanding of that.

553
00:27:04,735 --> 00:27:08,116
it's main use the whole point is it's supposed to point to the people and

554
00:27:08,956 --> 00:27:11,857
when you have your gun pointed a guard they won't shoot back because they're in

555
00:27:11,877 --> 00:27:15,157
that movie standoff situation where well if I shoot him what if his gun goes off

556
00:27:15,177 --> 00:27:17,238
and kills me and you're supposed to be thinking the same thing

557
00:27:17,718 --> 00:27:19,218
in actual fact if you do shoot them you're fine

558
00:27:20,738 --> 00:27:24,099
but I really wanted that I thought it would be a really tense moment you have to hold down

559
00:27:24,119 --> 00:27:27,660
the button to keep your gun pointed so it's just like if your finger slipped off the

560
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,760
button you would instantly be killed

561
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:32,641
and it does have that tension to it, you know I made it, it's in there, it's in the game

562
00:27:33,221 --> 00:27:33,461
but

563
00:27:34,081 --> 00:27:37,022
I didn't have a lot of luck designing puzzles around it.

564
00:27:37,102 --> 00:27:38,382
It wasn't that great of a puzzle mechanic.

565
00:27:38,503 --> 00:27:39,303
Once you have something at gunpoint,

566
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:40,643
there's a limited number of things you can do

567
00:27:40,843 --> 00:27:41,504
in that situation.

568
00:27:41,704 --> 00:27:42,764
You can kind of shuffle backwards,

569
00:27:43,084 --> 00:27:43,924
you can shuffle forwards,

570
00:27:44,204 --> 00:27:45,025
you can press a light switch.

571
00:27:45,505 --> 00:27:45,985
That's about it.

572
00:27:46,705 --> 00:27:48,066
Anything else involves putting your gun away

573
00:27:48,086 --> 00:27:48,726
and that gets you shot.

574
00:27:49,286 --> 00:27:50,987
So it wasn't a great puzzle mechanic.

575
00:27:51,447 --> 00:27:52,887
And once I made that, it sort of became clear

576
00:27:52,928 --> 00:27:54,328
it wasn't really the center of the game

577
00:27:54,668 --> 00:27:56,069
and calling it gunpoint was probably a bit silly.

578
00:27:56,709 --> 00:27:59,050
But I stuck with it because I had the word gun in it

579
00:27:59,150 --> 00:27:59,770
and people like that.

580
00:27:59,790 --> 00:28:00,550
So...

581
00:28:03,873 --> 00:28:08,136
the problem with it is that you can fly the gun as well like my idea was to use

582
00:28:08,176 --> 00:28:11,638
it to point to people but also let you fire it because you can't fire it

583
00:28:12,098 --> 00:28:12,719
then that's

584
00:28:13,779 --> 00:28:13,880
uh...

585
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:17,822
kind of tense situation of holding it holding some of the gunpoint loses

586
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:20,804
meaning like in order for pointing a gun to be meaningful you have to have the

587
00:28:20,944 --> 00:28:23,486
option of shooting them if you don't have that then you know you're bluffing

588
00:28:23,506 --> 00:28:24,987
and it kind of makes it a totally different situation

589
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:29,010
so you can just shoot people and of course it has to kill them everyone in gunpoint

590
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:29,750
dies in one hit

591
00:28:30,451 --> 00:28:31,411
uh... including you

592
00:28:32,412 --> 00:28:35,554
And that means, of course, you can just shoot a guard to get past the puzzle.

593
00:28:35,674 --> 00:28:37,155
You can solve the puzzle by just shooting the guard.

594
00:28:37,335 --> 00:28:38,716
Or you can shoot out a window to get through that.

595
00:28:39,496 --> 00:28:41,437
And so, I knew you'd be able to do that, obviously,

596
00:28:41,697 --> 00:28:43,638
and I thought of a great penalty for that,

597
00:28:43,839 --> 00:28:45,219
which is that if you fire a gun,

598
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:47,901
the police hear it, and they will show up in like 30 seconds.

599
00:28:48,381 --> 00:28:51,563
And when they show up, they will put a sniper on the subway exit,

600
00:28:51,583 --> 00:28:52,804
which is the only way out of every level,

601
00:28:53,244 --> 00:28:56,306
and that sniper can see infinitely far,

602
00:28:56,546 --> 00:28:59,127
has infinitely fast reactions, and a perfect aim.

603
00:28:59,428 --> 00:29:00,728
And will kill you in one shot, no matter what.

604
00:29:01,929 --> 00:29:03,850
So the game is kind of over at that point.

605
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:07,371
But I don't, that's why you're screwed

606
00:29:07,391 --> 00:29:08,412
because there's a sniper at the exit.

607
00:29:09,052 --> 00:29:10,973
And I didn't want to come down and say game over, right?

608
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:15,635
Because you're still alive, you've kind of failed your mission

609
00:29:15,735 --> 00:29:17,796
but I hate it in games when you fail your mission

610
00:29:17,836 --> 00:29:19,757
and it just says, well that's the end of your life then.

611
00:29:20,317 --> 00:29:22,598
Like when Sam Fisher fails in Splinter Cell

612
00:29:22,618 --> 00:29:24,799
and you set off one too many alarms

613
00:29:24,819 --> 00:29:26,780
and it just kind of fades to black and just says game over.

614
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:27,900
I'm like, what happened to him?

615
00:29:27,980 --> 00:29:29,401
I want to see what happens to Sam Fisher.

616
00:29:30,361 --> 00:29:31,161
So I didn't want to do that.

617
00:29:31,821 --> 00:29:33,462
But the problem with that is, of course,

618
00:29:33,482 --> 00:29:34,502
like the player is screwed,

619
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:35,522
they can't get out of the situation.

620
00:29:36,182 --> 00:29:37,622
What I want to happen is they go to the exit,

621
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,963
they get shot, and then they realize,

622
00:29:39,023 --> 00:29:41,083
oh yeah, I'm screwed, I better go and just restart that level

623
00:29:41,123 --> 00:29:43,023
or go back to like 19 save games

624
00:29:43,063 --> 00:29:44,224
because the game auto-saves constantly.

625
00:29:46,204 --> 00:29:49,165
The problem was, that was a little bit weird

626
00:29:49,205 --> 00:29:50,305
having a sort of game over situation

627
00:29:50,325 --> 00:29:51,385
that doesn't tell you it's game over

628
00:29:51,465 --> 00:29:53,065
and cause some confusion.

629
00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,506
People were kind of like, how do I get out of this situation?

630
00:29:55,526 --> 00:29:56,726
I have to tell them, you just can't.

631
00:29:57,026 --> 00:29:57,866
You're just fucked forever.

632
00:29:59,655 --> 00:30:06,205
but the bigger problem with the gun and gunpoint is that when you shoot someone

633
00:30:06,726 --> 00:30:10,050
it solves the puzzle in a sense of the word

634
00:30:12,933 --> 00:30:16,854
the time limit that impose the time it is a really big stressful

635
00:30:17,574 --> 00:30:22,436
penalty it's a really is a big deal and that's why used I want to play to feel

636
00:30:22,496 --> 00:30:26,077
kind of stressed and it's a it's a cost of doing something that you never need

637
00:30:26,097 --> 00:30:29,238
to do you never have to fire a gun so if you don't you don't because you decided

638
00:30:29,258 --> 00:30:33,300
to and I'm happy to give you a very big penalty for that make it scary and

639
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:37,521
stressful and you might get frustrated or you might have an amazing close

640
00:30:37,561 --> 00:30:38,681
escape.

641
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:40,222
The problem is that.

642
00:30:41,124 --> 00:30:43,426
the gun also lets you solve puzzles really quickly

643
00:30:44,387 --> 00:30:45,468
so if I give you a time limit

644
00:30:45,768 --> 00:30:47,930
for using the thing that lets you get past a puzzle quickly

645
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:51,393
you can then just use it again to get out of the time limit because you can just

646
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:54,856
shoot everybody and blow out all the windows and take what you want and then just leave

647
00:30:55,417 --> 00:30:58,620
so the penalty I was giving you was kind of undermined by the very thing you've

648
00:30:58,660 --> 00:31:00,001
just shown me you're willing to do

649
00:31:00,702 --> 00:31:02,864
so it's kind of a mess, there's probably a better way to do it but I spent...

650
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:07,559
like in front of the gun itself wasn't a huge cost but just was consequences all

651
00:31:07,579 --> 00:31:10,160
those little fiddly things of hang on the sniper shows up

652
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:14,781
how does the plan no that's crude or how does this might be shot like that

653
00:31:15,221 --> 00:31:18,362
I never got the animation working from to come up the steps and so he just kind

654
00:31:18,382 --> 00:31:19,482
of teleports in

655
00:31:19,962 --> 00:31:22,463
but then that's terrifying because it's almost an and shoots you in the same

656
00:31:22,503 --> 00:31:24,043
instance you don't even know why you died

657
00:31:24,623 --> 00:31:27,524
and I don't he's like all could little consequences and it was a difficult

658
00:31:27,844 --> 00:31:32,005
cause design problems cause technical problems and it was a big messy thing

659
00:31:32,385 --> 00:31:33,765
and I wish at some point I just thought

660
00:31:33,925 --> 00:31:36,468
Maybe I just shouldn't give you a gun. Maybe I should just leave that out.

661
00:31:36,848 --> 00:31:40,471
Just not that big a deal. It's a game about rewiring things and I kind of knew that.

662
00:31:40,551 --> 00:31:43,934
I'd made the whole game about rewiring things, but I just couldn't let go of the gun for some reason.

663
00:31:44,714 --> 00:31:45,635
Probably because it's called Gunpoint.

664
00:31:50,299 --> 00:31:54,883
So the fourth thing I learned was the best place to save time is in the concept.

665
00:31:54,903 --> 00:31:57,065
I'm not going to spend too long on this one because it's kind of...

666
00:31:57,545 --> 00:32:00,848
It is a really big deal. You can save years of your life at this point, but...

667
00:32:02,420 --> 00:32:05,943
it's of limited relevance to probably most of us because

668
00:32:06,784 --> 00:32:09,386
only some of us are in the situation where we actually get to be the guy who

669
00:32:09,426 --> 00:32:11,728
decides that what the new project is going to be

670
00:32:11,768 --> 00:32:14,090
what the new game is going to be and decide everything about it that's pretty

671
00:32:14,130 --> 00:32:18,474
rare privilege and even for those people you only get to

672
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:20,676
do it like once every one to two years right

673
00:32:21,297 --> 00:32:23,499
so but when it does come around it's worth

674
00:32:24,199 --> 00:32:29,600
The time you spend re-evaluating your concept and thinking again about what you want to make next,

675
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,821
what your next game should be,

676
00:32:31,841 --> 00:32:36,622
whether you're thinking individually or whether you're discussing it as a team and brainstorming and stuff,

677
00:32:38,702 --> 00:32:41,583
that time is going to pay off massively.

678
00:32:41,643 --> 00:32:48,204
One more week thinking about what you're going to make could save you a year of going down the wrong track

679
00:32:48,284 --> 00:32:50,525
or could just come up with a much better idea.

680
00:32:51,285 --> 00:32:52,625
When I finished Gunpoint, I was going to do a...

681
00:32:53,991 --> 00:32:57,793
I switched to unity for a while and I was going to make a kind of side on heist game

682
00:32:59,014 --> 00:33:02,355
in unity that would be a little bit like gunpoint but you'd have grappling hooks

683
00:33:02,555 --> 00:33:05,737
and you would, in fact I think I downloaded a video of this so

684
00:33:06,297 --> 00:33:08,278
I can show it to you hopefully, can I?

685
00:33:09,339 --> 00:33:09,919
No I didn't.

686
00:33:12,601 --> 00:33:14,902
We were on, oh god now I've lost what slide I was on.

687
00:33:15,842 --> 00:33:16,382
This is terrible.

688
00:33:18,904 --> 00:33:22,726
I'm just going to tab through a bunch of these. You might remember some of these scenes from earlier in the talk.

689
00:33:25,106 --> 00:33:28,155
Here we go, I don't have a video of what I want to show you.

690
00:33:28,717 --> 00:33:31,586
But there's no point in seeing it anyway because I've kind of abandoned it.

691
00:33:33,026 --> 00:33:33,266
it was a

692
00:33:34,728 --> 00:33:37,751
game much more in the vein of gunpoint but made in unity so much harder to make

693
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:42,055
and I was really really excited about it. The game mechanics seemed really

694
00:33:42,075 --> 00:33:42,615
exciting to me

695
00:33:42,956 --> 00:33:46,719
but also I had this kind of, I had a story in mind which I won't tell you because I might

696
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:47,260
make it one day

697
00:33:48,621 --> 00:33:52,025
but there were certain elements of the story, not so much like the plot but just the

698
00:33:52,085 --> 00:33:53,046
setting and the characters

699
00:33:53,926 --> 00:33:55,088
and this world that I was thinking of

700
00:33:55,468 --> 00:33:56,088
that were just like...

701
00:33:56,889 --> 00:33:59,891
driving crazy I was just it's not so excited about I kind of felt sick.

702
00:34:00,891 --> 00:34:03,572
I get excited about it and just be excited about for entire day and I was

703
00:34:03,632 --> 00:34:05,453
so sure this is my next game and definitely do this.

704
00:34:06,674 --> 00:34:08,154
It was so amazing and then

705
00:34:08,174 --> 00:34:12,396
I tried to make it and it took a very long time and I spent

706
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:15,758
I think it was the time I spent about a week trying to get a grappling hook to

707
00:34:15,938 --> 00:34:19,100
unwrap from around a lamppost. I suddenly realized like

708
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,361
this is just too hard I just need to do something else.

709
00:34:22,621 --> 00:34:25,002
Actually I didn't give up on it at that point I was just thinking.

710
00:34:26,713 --> 00:34:30,837
It was around that time that I was talking to a friend of mine about an idea I'd had years and years ago.

711
00:34:30,857 --> 00:34:34,120
One of those things that, I don't know if you guys do this, but sometimes

712
00:34:34,721 --> 00:34:38,925
you kind of think about the game you'd make if you had infinite money and a massive team and if you were, you know...

713
00:34:40,017 --> 00:34:42,360
the perfect overlord of a

714
00:34:42,860 --> 00:34:43,762
of infinite resources

715
00:34:44,342 --> 00:34:45,444
and my idea was like

716
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:46,605
I love spelunky

717
00:34:46,946 --> 00:34:48,909
and I often thought about like what's spelunky like in 3D

718
00:34:49,169 --> 00:34:50,851
this was kind of probably before Minecraft existed

719
00:34:52,193 --> 00:34:56,098
and how would you do that kind of random generation and make destructibility a

720
00:34:56,118 --> 00:34:56,899
really important thing

721
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:01,463
in a 3D game and I thought I would love a game where like you're just in the

722
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:04,866
infinite galaxy and you're like you're in a spacesuit and you have a jetpack

723
00:35:05,047 --> 00:35:08,049
and it's super powerful and your spacesuit is super tough and you're like a

724
00:35:08,109 --> 00:35:11,192
human missile you just slam yourself into the hulls of ships and just like

725
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:15,256
breach in and kill everybody and steal everything and it would be like inside

726
00:35:15,276 --> 00:35:18,158
the ships it would be like a randomly generated first-person shooter and

727
00:35:18,238 --> 00:35:21,661
outside you'd be jetting around and stuff and I knew I was never gonna make

728
00:35:21,701 --> 00:35:23,643
that I just wrote down some ideas for it for fun

729
00:35:24,884 --> 00:35:28,906
But then I was talking to my friend Graham and I think he mentioned it like

730
00:35:28,926 --> 00:35:32,027
he said I still think about the idea you had once and I was like hang on

731
00:35:32,467 --> 00:35:35,089
you just made that 2D I think I know how to do that in GameMaker right now

732
00:35:35,589 --> 00:35:38,130
and I think I could prototype that in like 2 days and so he did

733
00:35:38,150 --> 00:35:42,172
he was in the middle of this other game but I said you know this is going to be quick

734
00:35:42,252 --> 00:35:45,953
to find out whether this is any good or not and so I just started it in GameMaker and

735
00:35:46,634 --> 00:35:51,559
it very quickly became clear that it was eminently doable and it was really exciting and the second

736
00:35:51,599 --> 00:35:55,783
you go inside a spaceship that has been flying on the galaxy it's just a really magical moment

737
00:35:56,424 --> 00:35:58,005
and when I started to show it off in public as well

738
00:35:59,518 --> 00:36:02,480
weirdly even before I showed that you could go inside spaceships people are

739
00:36:02,500 --> 00:36:05,222
more excited about that than they were about the co-op grappling hook thing

740
00:36:05,262 --> 00:36:06,603
I've spent the last five months on.

741
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:11,246
So, and I kind of, I started to agree, I started to get more excited about it too.

742
00:36:11,646 --> 00:36:14,148
I was thinking it would be a quicker and easier, maybe smaller project,

743
00:36:14,468 --> 00:36:16,290
but the more I work on it the more Heat Signature is just like

744
00:36:16,730 --> 00:36:18,531
lighting my brain on fire and it's just so

745
00:36:19,011 --> 00:36:22,494
expansible and flexible and I can do anything with it and it's just so

746
00:36:22,514 --> 00:36:23,154
exciting to work on.

747
00:36:23,835 --> 00:36:27,398
So that was a situation where I had a concept, I was very sure what was going to be my next game

748
00:36:27,719 --> 00:36:30,661
and really I should have just spent more time thinking about what I wanted to do.

749
00:36:30,982 --> 00:36:33,744
I didn't really consider anything else, there was like a strategy game I thought about maybe.

750
00:36:34,926 --> 00:36:39,310
But I should have spent more time just reconsidering the concept

751
00:36:39,330 --> 00:36:42,893
because that's where I will probably save a year of my life by making this game instead.

752
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:47,597
and the thing I learned was how to stop being a perfectionist

753
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:49,959
and it's probably something a lot of us suffer from

754
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:54,723
maybe I might not be as afflicted with this as some people

755
00:36:55,083 --> 00:36:55,863
the other way of saying it is

756
00:36:56,184 --> 00:36:56,884
fuck it, that'll do

757
00:36:56,904 --> 00:36:56,924
I

758
00:36:59,286 --> 00:37:02,388
I do have this problem

759
00:37:03,409 --> 00:37:07,452
and I've kind of learnt a range of ways of trying to snap myself out of perfectionism

760
00:37:07,472 --> 00:37:10,254
trying to just let it go, just trying to move on

761
00:37:11,235 --> 00:37:11,355
and

762
00:37:13,343 --> 00:37:15,864
The main thing is every time I come back to work, I just ask myself,

763
00:37:16,424 --> 00:37:18,786
is this thing I'm working on the most important thing left to do?

764
00:37:18,866 --> 00:37:22,248
If I can only do one more thing before it just gets cast out into the world

765
00:37:22,288 --> 00:37:24,589
without any further input from me, is this what I would be working on?

766
00:37:25,429 --> 00:37:27,350
And 90% of the time the answer is no,

767
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,611
there's something much, much more important I should be working on.

768
00:37:31,352 --> 00:37:35,014
And so I keep like a to-do list that's in priority order as best I can.

769
00:37:35,034 --> 00:37:37,295
I try and, you know, put the most important things next.

770
00:37:38,616 --> 00:37:39,717
And I constantly reconsider it.

771
00:37:40,437 --> 00:37:42,578
And I also have to...

772
00:37:43,551 --> 00:37:47,518
use mental tricks to get over the pain of having to cut features.

773
00:37:47,859 --> 00:37:49,742
Like, when you put things in priority order, then...

774
00:37:51,764 --> 00:37:54,767
What you really need to be doing is when you're adding a big new idea to a game

775
00:37:55,147 --> 00:37:57,449
you should be cutting something out right you only got some amount of time

776
00:37:57,489 --> 00:38:00,872
and probably planned it reasonably well so that it's not going to take forever

777
00:38:01,232 --> 00:38:03,374
and if you can add something major you should be taking something away

778
00:38:03,874 --> 00:38:05,416
but emotionally I can't do that

779
00:38:06,276 --> 00:38:07,758
I'm too attached to everything that's already there

780
00:38:08,158 --> 00:38:10,780
and I don't want to like not write down the great new idea I just had

781
00:38:11,241 --> 00:38:13,062
so instead I just try and put them in priority order

782
00:38:13,542 --> 00:38:14,523
and it's kind of a trick I learned from.

783
00:38:15,925 --> 00:38:18,508
uh, writing about games, I would often be way over the word count

784
00:38:18,889 --> 00:38:21,072
and I couldn't bring myself to just cut out whole paragraphs

785
00:38:21,452 --> 00:38:24,076
so I'd just go through it and I'd just like indent the paragraphs

786
00:38:24,116 --> 00:38:25,698
that weren't quite as good as the other ones

787
00:38:26,259 --> 00:38:28,702
um, and once you do that, and you realise

788
00:38:29,123 --> 00:38:30,344
you look at the word count and realise

789
00:38:30,365 --> 00:38:31,666
oh, all those ones I indented

790
00:38:32,502 --> 00:38:34,304
equal the number of words I've gone over.

791
00:38:34,965 --> 00:38:37,147
So if I cut them all right now, then I'm done.

792
00:38:37,387 --> 00:38:39,469
The whole thing just fits and it's fine.

793
00:38:39,889 --> 00:38:41,411
Suddenly it's much easier to make that call.

794
00:38:41,731 --> 00:38:44,574
Whereas if you're going through and actually committing to deleting it right then and there,

795
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:45,555
it's a nightmare.

796
00:38:46,095 --> 00:38:46,575
So if you do a...

797
00:38:46,956 --> 00:38:49,458
If you have your to-do list in priority order,

798
00:38:49,498 --> 00:38:51,880
if you try and put all your ideas for the games in order of

799
00:38:52,201 --> 00:38:54,843
which is the most important thing not yet done.

800
00:38:55,484 --> 00:38:59,348
then the great thing about that is that you don't ever have to cut anything you

801
00:38:59,368 --> 00:39:02,111
can just pretend you're gonna do it all it's all on the list I'm gonna get to it

802
00:39:02,171 --> 00:39:05,794
one day and then when you're like when you're halfway down that list and you've

803
00:39:05,814 --> 00:39:09,478
done the most important half of those things it's really easy to cut the rest

804
00:39:09,498 --> 00:39:14,343
because it's been three fucking years just like I just need to fucking release this

805
00:39:16,510 --> 00:39:18,352
So that's what I did with Gunpoint. Gunpoint, you know, there's...

806
00:39:19,153 --> 00:39:21,715
The to-do list for that is twice as long as the things I actually did.

807
00:39:21,896 --> 00:39:23,177
I just got to the point where I'm like...

808
00:39:24,238 --> 00:39:27,541
I just gotta get it out there. I don't care about this goddamn camera bug.

809
00:39:27,981 --> 00:39:29,323
Which is what I'm going to show you.

810
00:39:29,343 --> 00:39:30,684
This is the camera bug in Gunpoint.

811
00:39:31,124 --> 00:39:36,890
It might not even register as a bug, but probably anyone who works on, like, game feel and kind of tweaking things

812
00:39:37,270 --> 00:39:38,091
is looking at this and kind of...

813
00:39:40,715 --> 00:39:44,502
When you climb up a wall and get onto the roof,

814
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:47,106
the artist, John Roberts, has done this brilliant,

815
00:39:47,206 --> 00:39:49,189
beautiful, smooth animation for clambering up.

816
00:39:49,269 --> 00:39:51,633
I love it, it's kind of sprightly and cool.

817
00:39:52,074 --> 00:39:54,758
And I've completely shat all over his work by...

818
00:39:56,280 --> 00:39:59,002
In code, you don't smoothly climb up, you teleport to the roof.

819
00:39:59,262 --> 00:40:02,344
I teleport you there, then I play the animation of the climbing up happening.

820
00:40:02,724 --> 00:40:06,967
And the camera is following your true location, not the animation, so it just snaps to being

821
00:40:07,087 --> 00:40:07,348
above.

822
00:40:07,828 --> 00:40:10,370
And if the view is scrolling, then you get this annoying little jerk.

823
00:40:10,730 --> 00:40:13,372
And the fact that it's looping constantly as I'm saying this is really pissing some

824
00:40:13,392 --> 00:40:13,732
people off.

825
00:40:16,152 --> 00:40:18,794
and it's pissed me off for like two years

826
00:40:18,814 --> 00:40:20,335
I was like, ah, I've got to fix that at some point

827
00:40:20,716 --> 00:40:22,817
and it's... it is an easy fix

828
00:40:22,857 --> 00:40:25,039
but it's maybe not 100% trivial

829
00:40:25,680 --> 00:40:26,801
because there's nothing in the game

830
00:40:26,821 --> 00:40:28,502
that does any kind of camera tweening or panning

831
00:40:28,542 --> 00:40:29,103
or anything like that

832
00:40:29,583 --> 00:40:31,245
I don't think I'd even heard the word tweening at this point

833
00:40:33,185 --> 00:40:37,068
and it was always on my to do list and I knew I always felt like it was essential

834
00:40:37,088 --> 00:40:40,291
this has to be done before I ship I can't release the game with this goddamn bug in it

835
00:40:40,871 --> 00:40:43,954
and I never fixed it this is from the currently released version of gunpoint

836
00:40:44,034 --> 00:40:47,477
it's still in there I didn't even patch it out because by the time I finished I was like

837
00:40:47,737 --> 00:40:52,360
my god that's the smallest concern in the world compared to the other things that were

838
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,262
wrong with gunpoint at the time that is nothing

839
00:40:56,183 --> 00:40:58,405
which brings me to a quote but

840
00:41:00,862 --> 00:41:03,624
This is a common aphorism, particularly amongst games journalists.

841
00:41:03,644 --> 00:41:06,106
Games journalists love to say this, I used to be one,

842
00:41:06,606 --> 00:41:09,188
because when you're a games journalist, your job is to analyze a game

843
00:41:09,228 --> 00:41:10,909
and say why it's good and why it's bad.

844
00:41:11,290 --> 00:41:15,352
And if you notice some subtle little thing in Legend of Zelda or Half-Life 2

845
00:41:15,392 --> 00:41:15,593
that...

846
00:41:17,774 --> 00:41:21,215
you love, then it's really easy to massively inflate its importance because

847
00:41:21,455 --> 00:41:26,236
A. It was something you noticed and you felt good for noticing it, but also B.

848
00:41:26,256 --> 00:41:28,417
You want to seem slightly more insightful than everyone else and like,

849
00:41:28,637 --> 00:41:31,618
ah, I noticed the subtle thing and I think that's so fucking important. If you didn't

850
00:41:31,638 --> 00:41:35,479
notice that, you don't appreciate the game as well as I do. And for me it was

851
00:41:35,499 --> 00:41:37,379
like, there's a moment in Half-Life 2 when...

852
00:41:39,060 --> 00:41:43,702
Barney throws you your crowbar and this is you know the iconic weapon and

853
00:41:44,182 --> 00:41:46,583
you're going to use it for the rest of the game

854
00:41:47,263 --> 00:41:49,624
but you're standing directly beneath him, he throws it to you

855
00:41:50,205 --> 00:41:51,145
you've got good aim

856
00:41:51,805 --> 00:41:53,946
and when it hits you it just goes into your inventory and you bring it up

857
00:41:54,467 --> 00:41:58,129
But I tried stepping back and letting a crowbar clatter to the floor.

858
00:41:58,149 --> 00:42:03,413
And when it clatters to the floor, it does so with the perfect noise for a crowbar clattering to a concrete surface.

859
00:42:03,894 --> 00:42:07,216
Which is nuts, because who the hell would back off when Barney throws the crowbar?

860
00:42:07,256 --> 00:42:10,979
Like, why is the sound for that so perfect? Why did they make it all such high fidelity?

861
00:42:10,999 --> 00:42:13,761
I was like, this is amazing! This is what's so great about Half-Life 2!

862
00:42:13,801 --> 00:42:18,305
They put this such rich fidelity into it, and it's the moment when you back off when a crowbar clatters to the floor.

863
00:42:18,865 --> 00:42:19,786
That's what really matters.

864
00:42:20,186 --> 00:42:21,027
No, it fucking isn't.

865
00:42:22,628 --> 00:42:25,549
like the little things can be important. I'm not saying that they're not.

866
00:42:25,689 --> 00:42:28,391
They can be really special and really nice, and I was really obsessed with this moment.

867
00:42:29,892 --> 00:42:33,694
But this statement says they're more important than the big things.

868
00:42:33,914 --> 00:42:37,415
No, they're not! The big things are much more important. That's why they're the big things.

869
00:42:37,856 --> 00:42:41,718
The gravity gun is really fucking important. The story in Half-Life 2 is really important.

870
00:42:42,018 --> 00:42:44,379
Like, loads of those set pieces are really important.

871
00:42:44,879 --> 00:42:47,140
And the little things are important, but they're less important.

872
00:42:48,981 --> 00:42:49,101
So...

873
00:42:51,768 --> 00:42:53,669
To summarize the thing I was saying earlier about

874
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:56,071
trying, about getting over that camera bug.

875
00:42:57,091 --> 00:42:58,672
It is easy to stop polishing the silverware

876
00:42:58,732 --> 00:43:00,293
once you realize how much of the house is on fire.

877
00:43:01,014 --> 00:43:03,495
And that is how I kind of snap out of getting obsessed

878
00:43:03,515 --> 00:43:04,556
with those little details now.

879
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:06,577
I try to remind myself how much of the house

880
00:43:06,637 --> 00:43:07,438
is currently on fire.

881
00:43:08,138 --> 00:43:10,800
And that means, when you, instead of like,

882
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:12,841
polishing the way that the character sits down

883
00:43:12,861 --> 00:43:14,663
in this particular chair, look at level three,

884
00:43:14,703 --> 00:43:15,883
which doesn't exist yet.

885
00:43:16,924 --> 00:43:18,925
Or level four, which actually can't be completed anymore.

886
00:43:19,610 --> 00:43:23,351
I was trying to do, I was working on a rating system for gunpoint

887
00:43:23,391 --> 00:43:25,271
so at the end of the level it gives you metrics of like

888
00:43:25,411 --> 00:43:31,333
you were this quiet and this fast and this violent

889
00:43:32,133 --> 00:43:35,133
and for the speed one I needed a par time for each level

890
00:43:35,713 --> 00:43:39,414
and so I had to play through the game and find out what my time was for those levels

891
00:43:39,434 --> 00:43:41,934
and then use that as the standard to judge other people by

892
00:43:42,535 --> 00:43:43,575
which is something I like to do in life.

893
00:43:47,035 --> 00:43:48,456
when I played the game through

894
00:43:48,476 --> 00:43:51,699
I couldn't play the game through, my game didn't work

895
00:43:52,699 --> 00:43:55,862
it had broken in about nine different ways since I last played the whole game through

896
00:43:56,222 --> 00:43:57,723
and so this tiny thing I was working on of like

897
00:43:58,043 --> 00:44:01,566
the part time for the level should really be an accurate reflection of my own personal abilities

898
00:44:02,006 --> 00:44:05,549
was actually not the biggest thing I needed fixing, the biggest thing I needed fixing was the game

899
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:10,692
and the sixth thing I learned was

900
00:44:11,433 --> 00:44:12,994
how to feel good about yourself at the end of the day

901
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:18,488
This is something I really sucked at first because I was new to programming

902
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:23,594
and I was initially for the first year at gunpoint I was working totally on my own

903
00:44:24,615 --> 00:44:25,936
and I was working the weekends

904
00:44:26,557 --> 00:44:29,700
and so during the week I'd be thinking all the time about the game, what I was going to do on it

905
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:31,922
and I had loads and loads of ideas I wanted to put in

906
00:44:32,243 --> 00:44:34,365
and then when I got to the weekend I would have a specific idea of

907
00:44:34,785 --> 00:44:38,369
I want to get this feature in this weekend, I want to get elevators working, I want to do this.

908
00:44:39,810 --> 00:44:42,772
and then sometimes I would do it, sometimes I would fail to do it

909
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:48,195
and sometimes I would just be not even close, like not even ten percent of the way to getting that thing done

910
00:44:48,615 --> 00:44:52,377
and it would just be soul crushing, I would just feel terrible

911
00:44:52,537 --> 00:44:55,119
and I just felt like an idiot, I just felt like this is, like

912
00:44:55,139 --> 00:44:56,579
I was supposed to get this done this weekend

913
00:44:57,040 --> 00:44:59,941
and I'm not going to get it done next weekend or the weekend after

914
00:44:59,961 --> 00:45:03,383
and that's even more crushing when you're working part-time because that's not

915
00:45:03,864 --> 00:45:06,345
that's not six days away, that's three weeks away

916
00:45:07,307 --> 00:45:13,692
So I would get really pissed off at myself and feel stupid and feel frustrated.

917
00:45:15,013 --> 00:45:17,915
And eventually I realized, like, this is kind of ridiculous.

918
00:45:17,935 --> 00:45:21,798
Because if I had, if I employed a programmer to do this for me,

919
00:45:22,338 --> 00:45:24,700
and I said, OK, a task for this weekend is to get elevators working.

920
00:45:25,101 --> 00:45:26,922
And they came back to me on Monday and said,

921
00:45:28,944 --> 00:45:31,105
look, it turns out to be a much bigger job than we realized.

922
00:45:31,866 --> 00:45:34,308
I'm only 10% of the way through this. It's going to be really difficult.

923
00:45:35,752 --> 00:45:37,972
It might take another four weekends, realistically.

924
00:45:39,692 --> 00:45:40,953
My reaction to that would not be,

925
00:45:41,033 --> 00:45:42,813
you fucking idiot, what's wrong with you?

926
00:45:42,833 --> 00:45:45,254
It would obviously be, oh, that's interesting.

927
00:45:46,394 --> 00:45:47,294
Thanks for looking into it.

928
00:45:47,834 --> 00:45:48,874
That's valuable data.

929
00:45:49,014 --> 00:45:50,575
We didn't have that information beforehand.

930
00:45:50,675 --> 00:45:51,695
I didn't have it, you didn't have it.

931
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:53,595
We didn't know how big this job was,

932
00:45:54,035 --> 00:45:55,396
and you have done the valuable work

933
00:45:55,436 --> 00:45:57,336
of going out and finding out how big that job was

934
00:45:57,396 --> 00:45:58,056
by trying to do it.

935
00:45:58,436 --> 00:45:59,436
And now we have more information,

936
00:45:59,476 --> 00:46:00,437
we can make better decisions.

937
00:46:00,817 --> 00:46:01,957
Nothing has gone wrong, really.

938
00:46:03,117 --> 00:46:08,140
what has happened is the new information is a shame it's bad news for us but it's

939
00:46:08,180 --> 00:46:10,662
nobody's fault it's not a problem someone's created it's the thing that

940
00:46:10,702 --> 00:46:13,764
we've just learned about the task that we're undertaking and now it's my job as

941
00:46:13,784 --> 00:46:18,867
a designer to or as a producer depending on how you want to classify it to decide

942
00:46:19,147 --> 00:46:21,728
do we still want to do that is that feature still worth doing do we have to

943
00:46:21,768 --> 00:46:26,131
do it if we do have to do it is there an easier way to do it can we rethink and

944
00:46:26,171 --> 00:46:29,293
if the answer to all those questions is no and we do have to do it then

945
00:46:30,033 --> 00:46:34,494
I just have to figure out how we fit that all into the schedule and what else we're going to cut

946
00:46:35,634 --> 00:46:37,195
how we figure out how to do that.

947
00:46:37,795 --> 00:46:41,456
And so, it took me an embarrassingly long time to apply that logic to myself

948
00:46:41,616 --> 00:46:45,497
and realize that when I fail to complete something by a massive degree

949
00:46:45,897 --> 00:46:47,858
I should be nicer to myself about it. I should say,

950
00:46:47,898 --> 00:46:51,279
okay, you put in the hours, you tried it, you got more information

951
00:46:51,719 --> 00:46:53,680
this is useful stuff, I've done my job.

952
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,181
So if you are your own boss, be a good one.

953
00:46:56,941 --> 00:47:02,143
And obviously I realize that this is a luxury in my case.

954
00:47:02,163 --> 00:47:03,804
You know, it's been great to be my own boss

955
00:47:03,864 --> 00:47:06,865
and to be in control of my own, how I am treated and stuff.

956
00:47:08,186 --> 00:47:12,568
And obviously I'm also, I'm gonna talk a bit about

957
00:47:13,688 --> 00:47:15,929
how many hours you work and that kind of stuff.

958
00:47:17,050 --> 00:47:19,931
But I want to be very clear that I appreciate

959
00:47:20,011 --> 00:47:21,492
it's a luxury for me to be able to decide

960
00:47:21,512 --> 00:47:22,332
how many hours I want to work.

961
00:47:23,153 --> 00:47:23,673
I work like.

962
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,180
eight hours in a day or something.

963
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,541
And I know that some of you probably work for,

964
00:47:29,041 --> 00:47:30,561
in an environment where you don't get to decide

965
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:33,201
how much you work, and probably many of you

966
00:47:33,301 --> 00:47:34,622
are sometimes asked to crunch,

967
00:47:35,162 --> 00:47:36,542
and probably many of you don't want to crunch,

968
00:47:36,922 --> 00:47:39,963
and probably many of you are just in a situation

969
00:47:39,983 --> 00:47:41,663
where that is inescapable.

970
00:47:42,423 --> 00:47:44,864
And that's okay, but if anyone is trying

971
00:47:44,904 --> 00:47:46,504
to make you feel personally bad

972
00:47:46,624 --> 00:47:47,764
for not getting the thing done,

973
00:47:47,784 --> 00:47:49,925
if anyone's trying to make you feel like it's your fault

974
00:47:50,025 --> 00:47:52,165
that this job turns out to be a bigger job than you thought,

975
00:47:52,465 --> 00:47:53,265
then fuck that person.

976
00:47:54,093 --> 00:47:55,334
And if it's you, fuck yourself.

977
00:47:59,677 --> 00:48:01,518
So at the end of the day, I just ask myself two questions.

978
00:48:01,558 --> 00:48:04,480
I ask, did I work eight hours and did I work efficiently?

979
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:08,383
And the number of hours, you can plug your own number in there.

980
00:48:08,523 --> 00:48:10,585
Some people work a lot more than that, some people work less.

981
00:48:11,966 --> 00:48:12,906
Probably most people work more.

982
00:48:14,087 --> 00:48:16,709
And that's not necessarily, like, unhealthy.

983
00:48:17,710 --> 00:48:20,091
Some people just like to work, you know, 12, 14 hours in a day.

984
00:48:20,692 --> 00:48:24,915
I actually, I do do that if I'm really just on a particular problem that's obsessing me

985
00:48:24,955 --> 00:48:27,697
and that I'm really kind of engrossed in and I want to spend that time.

986
00:48:29,038 --> 00:48:31,740
But it's worth kind of setting a standard for yourself, just deciding for yourself,

987
00:48:31,780 --> 00:48:33,741
what is a good workday, what should I be doing every day?

988
00:48:35,162 --> 00:48:38,324
And that applies even if you are working in an office job where it's 9 to 5

989
00:48:38,604 --> 00:48:39,705
and your hours are imposed by someone else.

990
00:48:40,085 --> 00:48:42,667
There's still a difference between showing up for eight hours

991
00:48:42,707 --> 00:48:44,228
and actually working for eight hours, right?

992
00:48:44,929 --> 00:48:46,049
And if you...

993
00:48:46,945 --> 00:48:51,452
didn't work those 8 hours and the reason was you're on Twitter, then you can feel bad about that.

994
00:48:52,874 --> 00:48:56,158
And if you didn't work 8 hours for some like, you know...

995
00:48:57,074 --> 00:48:59,396
family reason or you were ill or something,

996
00:48:59,596 --> 00:49:01,177
then obviously you don't feel bad about that.

997
00:49:01,317 --> 00:49:03,719
That's just something that you just need to ask the question,

998
00:49:03,900 --> 00:49:05,661
find out if you didn't work eight hours, why was it?

999
00:49:06,022 --> 00:49:07,843
And then decide, do I need to do something about that?

1000
00:49:08,083 --> 00:49:09,805
If you didn't work eight hours because you got distracted,

1001
00:49:10,125 --> 00:49:11,306
you do need to do something about that.

1002
00:49:11,326 --> 00:49:12,447
You need to change your working process,

1003
00:49:12,467 --> 00:49:14,229
you need to change your access to distractions,

1004
00:49:14,269 --> 00:49:15,530
you need to change something.

1005
00:49:15,990 --> 00:49:17,552
And the same for the efficiency question.

1006
00:49:17,852 --> 00:49:18,553
Did I work efficiently?

1007
00:49:19,566 --> 00:49:21,086
because it's okay if you didn't get the job done,

1008
00:49:21,527 --> 00:49:22,667
but if the reason you didn't get the job done

1009
00:49:22,707 --> 00:49:24,107
is because you worked in some stupid way,

1010
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,648
you just bashed your head against one tiny problem

1011
00:49:25,668 --> 00:49:26,728
without looking at the bigger picture,

1012
00:49:27,128 --> 00:49:28,108
then you need to ask yourself,

1013
00:49:28,529 --> 00:49:30,109
is there something I can do to avoid that in future?

1014
00:49:30,289 --> 00:49:31,789
That needs something to change.

1015
00:49:32,450 --> 00:49:35,351
Whereas in the example earlier with the elevators,

1016
00:49:35,391 --> 00:49:37,811
I think I said, if that thing is taking, you know,

1017
00:49:38,051 --> 00:49:38,992
10 times longer than you thought,

1018
00:49:39,612 --> 00:49:42,493
then that's not the answer to either of these questions.

1019
00:49:42,953 --> 00:49:43,393
You don't care.

1020
00:49:43,793 --> 00:49:45,153
You worked eight hours, you worked efficiently,

1021
00:49:45,393 --> 00:49:46,274
that's all you have to ask yourself.

1022
00:49:46,654 --> 00:49:47,354
You should feel good about it.

1023
00:49:49,883 --> 00:49:53,385
So to recap, first point was choose ideas

1024
00:49:53,425 --> 00:49:54,686
based on value divided by work,

1025
00:49:54,826 --> 00:49:56,007
i.e. choose efficient ideas.

1026
00:49:56,247 --> 00:49:57,508
Those are more important than good ideas.

1027
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,170
Second one was that quick ideas are worth making.

1028
00:50:00,610 --> 00:50:02,292
Good ideas are worth trying.

1029
00:50:02,452 --> 00:50:05,234
If you're uncertain about how good they'll be,

1030
00:50:05,354 --> 00:50:05,754
just make them.

1031
00:50:06,094 --> 00:50:07,855
If you're uncertain about how long they'll take,

1032
00:50:08,136 --> 00:50:09,997
try making them, just to give it a go

1033
00:50:10,077 --> 00:50:11,398
for a certain limited period of time.

1034
00:50:11,818 --> 00:50:12,979
Do a kind of feasibility study

1035
00:50:13,920 --> 00:50:15,361
and then decide whether to carry on with it.

1036
00:50:16,110 --> 00:50:19,631
Number three is not doing things is instant and free, and it always works.

1037
00:50:20,412 --> 00:50:22,212
So it's always worth considering not doing something.

1038
00:50:23,953 --> 00:50:26,914
Number four, overcome perfectionism by knowing how much is broken.

1039
00:50:28,535 --> 00:50:30,996
Stop polishing the silverware by realizing how much of the house is on fire.

1040
00:50:31,997 --> 00:50:34,578
And number five is if you put in the hours, never feel bad about yourself.

1041
00:50:36,509 --> 00:50:39,091
So I think this stuff is important because your life is precious.

1042
00:50:40,712 --> 00:50:42,413
I think it's okay to waste it making video games

1043
00:50:43,454 --> 00:50:46,277
but it's a shame to spend a lot of it on things that go unappreciated.

1044
00:50:47,718 --> 00:50:48,679
So that's it, thank you very much.

1045
00:51:01,269 --> 00:51:03,871
We have time for questions so if you want to go to a microphone if you have one

1046
00:51:04,732 --> 00:51:05,653
but if you don't that's fine too.

1047
00:51:07,198 --> 00:51:10,640
Hello. I have a question about burnout, specifically from the

1048
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,001
perspective of working a full-time job and also working

1049
00:51:13,041 --> 00:51:16,223
on a game on the side. You talk about how you committed to

1050
00:51:16,283 --> 00:51:18,505
working only on the weekends and working eight hours and feeling

1051
00:51:18,525 --> 00:51:23,027
good about that. I'm wondering, one, whether you had a time

1052
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:24,889
period before that where you were working too hard and

1053
00:51:24,909 --> 00:51:27,730
experiencing burnout. And two, after you developed that

1054
00:51:27,770 --> 00:51:31,513
process, whether you still encountered burnout and if you

1055
00:51:31,533 --> 00:51:32,853
did, how you dealt with that.

1056
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:34,879
Yeah, that's a good question.

1057
00:51:35,861 --> 00:51:39,087
So it was if I started working too hard

1058
00:51:39,107 --> 00:51:40,230
and then came up with that.

1059
00:51:40,600 --> 00:51:44,623
that schedule to counteract that, and whether I ever did experience burnout.

1060
00:51:45,464 --> 00:51:48,687
It was kind of the opposite. I started much, much more relaxed than that.

1061
00:51:49,728 --> 00:51:53,752
So when I started it was at like one weekend a month maybe, because Gunpoint was just a

1062
00:51:53,772 --> 00:51:56,434
hobby project. I was just curious about whether I could design a game.

1063
00:51:56,895 --> 00:52:00,758
Actually I kind of wanted a job at Valve, and I knew that they don't care about your

1064
00:52:00,778 --> 00:52:03,221
qualifications, you just have to make something and show them what you can do.

1065
00:52:03,541 --> 00:52:04,682
So I thought, well I should make something and show...

1066
00:52:05,262 --> 00:52:05,843
than what I can do.

1067
00:52:05,863 --> 00:52:07,624
But it was always going to be a free thing.

1068
00:52:07,684 --> 00:52:08,785
It was just like a trial project.

1069
00:52:08,805 --> 00:52:10,166
It was going to be like half an hour long.

1070
00:52:10,746 --> 00:52:12,448
And I was going to make it in like six months maybe.

1071
00:52:12,828 --> 00:52:15,310
And so I was only working one weekend a month on average.

1072
00:52:15,570 --> 00:52:16,411
And it was much more like,

1073
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:18,172
oh, I've got nothing to do this weekend.

1074
00:52:18,192 --> 00:52:19,993
I think I'll try GameMaker again and just dabble with it.

1075
00:52:20,093 --> 00:52:21,695
Which I know I have a lot of friends

1076
00:52:21,715 --> 00:52:22,735
who are kind of at that stage now

1077
00:52:22,775 --> 00:52:24,277
where they have a hobby project like that.

1078
00:52:24,757 --> 00:52:26,198
And so it actually, it ramped up.

1079
00:52:27,119 --> 00:52:32,201
as it became a bigger deal, as people started being more excited about it when I showed it

1080
00:52:32,341 --> 00:52:35,563
and I started to realize I might be onto something, and eventually people started telling me I should

1081
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:41,706
charge money for it, which is a weird situation. I asked them, I said, like people kept telling me

1082
00:52:41,726 --> 00:52:46,108
you're mad to give this away for free, you're an idiot. So I did a new trailer and said, look,

1083
00:52:46,268 --> 00:52:50,010
am I an idiot? Should I give this away for free or should I charge for it? And I got a thousand

1084
00:52:50,050 --> 00:52:54,213
comments on that blog post and 99% of them said I should charge for it.

1085
00:52:55,315 --> 00:53:02,162
So I did. So it became a professional thing as it went along and I was probably working more and more intensely as it went along.

1086
00:53:02,722 --> 00:53:08,027
And to your burnout question, towards the end it did start to get...

1087
00:53:09,637 --> 00:53:13,559
I did start to reach a really critical point where I've been working on it for nearly three years.

1088
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:15,761
I was still doing a full-time job.

1089
00:53:16,081 --> 00:53:20,043
Full-time job wasn't getting any less stressful or less difficult.

1090
00:53:20,063 --> 00:53:24,766
It was a relatively easy job compared to game development.

1091
00:53:25,886 --> 00:53:26,106
But...

1092
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:33,009
it was taking its toll. I'd just been working out so long and I was just working every day of every week

1093
00:53:33,269 --> 00:53:37,091
all the time, no time off, couldn't go to GDC or anything like that because that would be a huge

1094
00:53:37,551 --> 00:53:43,853
expense in time and at that point I took a sabbatical from my job where I, because I've

1095
00:53:43,873 --> 00:53:49,595
been there for many many years, I was able to take three months off unpaid leave and at the end of

1096
00:53:49,655 --> 00:53:53,096
it I was guaranteed my job back if I wanted it.

1097
00:53:54,868 --> 00:54:02,136
and as soon as I stopped doing the day job and was able to just work on gunpoint like six days a week and actually have a day off in a week

1098
00:54:02,957 --> 00:54:08,022
that I got it finished in less than two months I released it and it was out before my sabbatical was up

1099
00:54:08,503 --> 00:54:12,868
and it sold well enough in that period that I could quit my job right away and I gave my notice such that

1100
00:54:14,009 --> 00:54:15,129
I think I had to give two weeks notice,

1101
00:54:15,249 --> 00:54:16,750
and after the first two weeks, I already knew

1102
00:54:16,770 --> 00:54:18,310
it sold well enough for me to quit my job,

1103
00:54:18,350 --> 00:54:19,351
so I gave my notice then.

1104
00:54:19,371 --> 00:54:22,392
And I think, technically, I was supposed to go back

1105
00:54:22,452 --> 00:54:23,773
for one day, and I never did.

1106
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:25,633
So I still owe future publishing one day.

1107
00:54:28,334 --> 00:54:28,615
Thank you.

1108
00:54:30,555 --> 00:54:31,896
I'm wondering if you can describe at all

1109
00:54:31,916 --> 00:54:34,257
your process of imposing constraints on yourself,

1110
00:54:34,317 --> 00:54:36,058
because it seems that in some ways,

1111
00:54:36,318 --> 00:54:38,899
you had the luxury of few constraints,

1112
00:54:38,959 --> 00:54:41,260
in that you had the source of income from a day job.

1113
00:54:41,810 --> 00:54:45,111
I imagine there wasn't an external force sort of holding you to a release date.

1114
00:54:45,911 --> 00:54:49,012
But working efficiently is all about working effectively within constraints.

1115
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:52,953
So how did you impose whatever constraints you needed to work effectively?

1116
00:54:52,973 --> 00:54:56,254
So you're asking did I impose constraints on myself?

1117
00:54:58,688 --> 00:55:01,630
Yeah, my biggest constraint was my own boredom.

1118
00:55:02,391 --> 00:55:04,632
I was worried about getting sick of the project

1119
00:55:04,933 --> 00:55:08,275
and working on it after I was sick of it.

1120
00:55:08,375 --> 00:55:09,796
I knew it would be less fun.

1121
00:55:10,217 --> 00:55:10,637
And it was.

1122
00:55:10,677 --> 00:55:11,898
I did get sick of it.

1123
00:55:12,398 --> 00:55:13,679
So that was my time limit.

1124
00:55:13,719 --> 00:55:14,360
That was my deadline.

1125
00:55:14,720 --> 00:55:17,422
I also stupidly did an ounce release dates for it.

1126
00:55:17,442 --> 00:55:18,283
I was like, it's going to be done.

1127
00:55:19,184 --> 00:55:22,226
I first I was like it's gonna be done by May and then it wasn't done by May and

1128
00:55:22,246 --> 00:55:25,109
it wasn't done by the end of the year and then I started thinking like I know

1129
00:55:25,169 --> 00:55:29,113
I'll release I'll give a release date that's actually an earliest possible

1130
00:55:29,153 --> 00:55:33,697
date so I would say it won't be done sooner than May thinking like everyone

1131
00:55:33,717 --> 00:55:36,320
will understand that and of course when May comes along they're like where the

1132
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:37,901
fuck is it I thought you said it would be out by now

1133
00:55:38,766 --> 00:55:40,667
So then I just stopped giving release dates completely.

1134
00:55:41,347 --> 00:55:44,028
But I still have my own internal sense of like,

1135
00:55:44,308 --> 00:55:46,208
this, I hope this doesn't take more than,

1136
00:55:46,728 --> 00:55:48,029
you know, six more months.

1137
00:55:48,429 --> 00:55:51,450
Or, gunpoint, that point where I was getting stressed,

1138
00:55:51,470 --> 00:55:52,630
that I was talking about just now,

1139
00:55:53,650 --> 00:55:55,411
it was because I looked at my to-do list

1140
00:55:55,651 --> 00:55:57,171
and it looked like I had a year left

1141
00:55:57,671 --> 00:55:58,572
and this was three years in.

1142
00:55:58,652 --> 00:55:59,892
I'm like, I can't do another year

1143
00:56:00,312 --> 00:56:02,493
to get this goddamned thing out.

1144
00:56:02,733 --> 00:56:04,694
So that was my only self-imposed constraint, I think.

1145
00:56:05,074 --> 00:56:05,994
I mean, other than that, just.

1146
00:56:06,904 --> 00:56:10,566
I guess like getting bored of it is one thing and also patience is another thing.

1147
00:56:10,606 --> 00:56:11,467
I didn't have a lot of patience.

1148
00:56:11,527 --> 00:56:14,729
I was very antsy to work on it.

1149
00:56:14,769 --> 00:56:18,211
Like all day at work I'm thinking, daydreaming about what I'm going to do on it.

1150
00:56:18,311 --> 00:56:20,532
And I only get those two days a week to actually work on it.

1151
00:56:20,552 --> 00:56:21,973
So that felt like a huge constraint.

1152
00:56:21,993 --> 00:56:23,694
I was like, I want to be working all the time, but I couldn't.

1153
00:56:24,675 --> 00:56:26,656
So yeah, I think that's the best I can do for that.

1154
00:56:28,412 --> 00:56:31,533
Hi, I was wondering, can you talk about how you efficiently

1155
00:56:32,053 --> 00:56:35,414
use your time to find and then work with your artist and sound

1156
00:56:35,434 --> 00:56:35,774
designer?

1157
00:56:36,414 --> 00:56:40,175
Oh yeah, I did that by, because it was a hobby project,

1158
00:56:40,275 --> 00:56:41,555
I was thinking I would release it for free.

1159
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:44,095
Once I started considering charging money for it,

1160
00:56:44,115 --> 00:56:45,176
I still didn't know for sure if I would.

1161
00:56:45,696 --> 00:56:47,636
And so I couldn't promise anyone any money for it.

1162
00:56:47,816 --> 00:56:50,517
So I was in a very difficult position.

1163
00:56:50,537 --> 00:56:52,397
I thought I'd never get any help at all with it.

1164
00:56:53,858 --> 00:57:09,242
But in the spirit of like just let's make a free thing together, I put out a trailer with my terrible programmer art and I asked in the trailer itself, in the voiceover for it as I was recording it and explaining the game, I said obviously you can see I need art help pretty badly.

1165
00:57:09,622 --> 00:57:14,103
If anyone wants to help me then just like send me a sample of what you might do for this.

1166
00:57:16,304 --> 00:57:18,386
I think at that point I was pretty sure it was going to be free.

1167
00:57:18,406 --> 00:57:20,989
I don't think I actually mentioned even the possibility of money.

1168
00:57:22,031 --> 00:57:25,255
So I said I can't pay you, it's all free, I'm doing it for free, you're doing it for free.

1169
00:57:25,755 --> 00:57:28,298
And 30 artists applied to that, which is awesome.

1170
00:57:28,919 --> 00:57:30,721
And that's how I found John Roberts, who...

1171
00:57:32,163 --> 00:57:36,227
did, his sample actually was like, this is now,

1172
00:57:36,707 --> 00:57:39,410
I'm just suddenly realizing is very emblematic

1173
00:57:39,430 --> 00:57:41,232
of our whole working relationship.

1174
00:57:41,272 --> 00:57:42,573
I'm still working with him on Heat Signature.

1175
00:57:43,114 --> 00:57:46,157
And his sample for it was like a cyborg on a trench coat

1176
00:57:46,217 --> 00:57:48,079
with like a robot face and a silence thing,

1177
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:49,740
which is totally inappropriate for company.

1178
00:57:50,641 --> 00:57:53,884
There were no cyborgs in it. It's like, it is in the near future, but it's all humans.

1179
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,987
And right now John and I are having a disagreement about whether Heat Signet should have aliens in it.

1180
00:57:58,328 --> 00:58:02,111
And he thinks it should have aliens and robots and I want it to be all humans and all realistic.

1181
00:58:02,631 --> 00:58:06,054
But he had, he worked at Frontier Developments at the time on like,

1182
00:58:07,515 --> 00:58:11,659
I think, Kinect, Disney and Adventures, and some other like Kinect games that David Braben was doing.

1183
00:58:13,296 --> 00:58:18,521
and he was a 3D artist, he'd never done pixel art before he did the art for Gunpoint, which blows my mind.

1184
00:58:19,222 --> 00:58:25,548
And then, once his art was in there, the game looked way better, and I did a new trailer explaining the game again,

1185
00:58:26,189 --> 00:58:29,953
and saying, you know, some people said I should have music, should I have music?

1186
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:32,936
And if you want to do music, send me a sample.

1187
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:35,158
And I think we got...

1188
00:58:35,833 --> 00:58:39,314
I can't remember how many, I think maybe like 40 composers applied for that, which is amazing.

1189
00:58:39,695 --> 00:58:44,116
And that time I did say, I don't know if we'll sell it, but if we do sell it, we'll do like a revenue share thing,

1190
00:58:44,136 --> 00:58:45,756
and we'll figure out a fair split.

1191
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:48,477
And obviously we did decide to sell it, and so

1192
00:58:49,237 --> 00:58:51,898
at the moment I decided to do that, I sent around an email saying,

1193
00:58:51,938 --> 00:58:54,239
here's what I think would be a fair revenue share for all of us.

1194
00:58:55,479 --> 00:58:56,280
And everyone agreed to that.

1195
00:58:57,800 --> 00:59:01,881
And then it came out, and it did really well, and so they have

1196
00:59:02,681 --> 00:59:05,062
benefited enormously from that arrangement for sure.

1197
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:07,059
Thank you.

1198
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:11,042
Hi, I was just wondering if you could talk

1199
00:59:11,062 --> 00:59:12,423
a little bit more about finding that balance

1200
00:59:12,443 --> 00:59:14,965
when you have a day job and this is the side project

1201
00:59:15,225 --> 00:59:17,867
of trying to work efficiently around the other thing

1202
00:59:17,887 --> 00:59:20,989
without impacting your work in the other job.

1203
00:59:21,617 --> 00:59:25,161
Yes, the question is about working around a day job and managing your time efficiently.

1204
00:59:25,541 --> 00:59:28,685
My great advantage in that, and I was very lucky, was

1205
00:59:29,345 --> 00:59:31,988
that my day job as a games writer was...

1206
00:59:32,669 --> 00:59:34,991
I'd consciously avoided responsibility,

1207
00:59:36,333 --> 00:59:39,436
never gone for promotions and stuff, I just wanted to be a writer, just like a workhorse,

1208
00:59:39,476 --> 00:59:42,098
just churn out words and do nothing else, didn't want to be responsible for anything.

1209
00:59:43,400 --> 00:59:43,740
And so...

1210
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,862
that was just like writing but had the added benefit of my job was pretty much

1211
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:51,663
it could be 9 to 5 if I wanted it to be so

1212
00:59:52,924 --> 00:59:55,285
at the time I started I was doing over time and I was you know

1213
00:59:56,025 --> 00:59:59,667
if I was working review I'd usually spend some of the weekend making it better and

1214
00:59:59,967 --> 01:00:01,748
you know maybe playing the game more thoroughly and that kind of stuff

1215
01:00:03,069 --> 01:00:07,311
but a it was a job where if I wanted to I could just say I'm just a 9 to 5 now

1216
01:00:07,351 --> 01:00:08,212
that's it

1217
01:00:08,472 --> 01:00:08,972
I know whenever.

1218
01:00:09,449 --> 01:00:13,493
pressured me about that, no one ever complained or was disappointed that I did that.

1219
01:00:14,114 --> 01:00:15,976
The people I worked with were just lovely, just really nice people.

1220
01:00:16,717 --> 01:00:20,021
And also it's a job writing about video games, so it's not the hardest thing in the world.

1221
01:00:20,722 --> 01:00:21,503
Apologies to those who do.

1222
01:00:25,257 --> 01:00:28,338
It's not a game we just play games right about all day there's a lot of like

1223
01:00:28,398 --> 01:00:32,899
organizational stuff and management and stress and stuff but in the just

1224
01:00:33,020 --> 01:00:36,881
workhorse right to position the worst thing that can happen is that you have

1225
01:00:36,901 --> 01:00:39,742
to write a lot of words very quickly and you know that's something I've enjoyed

1226
01:00:39,782 --> 01:00:45,343
doing anyway and it just wasn't very kind of high stress position and I got

1227
01:00:45,363 --> 01:00:46,263
to play video games.

1228
01:00:48,524 --> 01:00:51,566
Deus Ex Human Revolution came out, I was massively excited about that game

1229
01:00:51,906 --> 01:00:54,748
and I was down to review it and I was working on Gunpoint as well

1230
01:00:55,149 --> 01:00:59,132
and it was at the point where Gunpoint was getting to be really technical, just difficult, hard work

1231
01:00:59,152 --> 01:01:01,173
okay, we're going to wrap this up after this

1232
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:07,058
and I was getting so stressed working on that at the weekend

1233
01:01:07,098 --> 01:01:10,341
that I was like, God, I can't wait for it to be Monday and I can just play Deus Ex Human Revolution all day

1234
01:01:13,121 --> 01:01:14,584
So we have to stop it for questions there,

1235
01:01:14,685 --> 01:01:18,493
but we can go to the wrap-up room in 3,000

1236
01:01:18,713 --> 01:01:19,816
if anyone wants to ask me anything else.

1237
01:01:20,958 --> 01:01:21,379
Thank you very much.
