00:00:11,915 --> 00:00:17,862
Hello, good afternoon and welcome everyone to this panel dedicated to the life and works

2
00:00:18,262 --> 00:00:25,130
of solo developers, aptly called Solo Development Myths, Reality and Survival Tactics.

3
00:00:26,451 --> 00:00:27,511
I'm your moderator for today.

4
00:00:28,072 --> 00:00:29,373
My name is Erik Bartelsson.

5
00:00:29,733 --> 00:00:32,395
I'm editor-in-chief of the gaming B2B website,

6
00:00:32,935 --> 00:00:34,256
premortem.games.

7
00:00:36,137 --> 00:00:36,938
Before we get started,

8
00:00:37,278 --> 00:00:38,999
I would like to point out that this panel

9
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:41,721
was co-organized by Alessandra van Otterloo,

10
00:00:41,881 --> 00:00:44,082
who would also be doing the moderation.

11
00:00:44,903 --> 00:00:47,064
But unfortunately, she had to return home

12
00:00:47,124 --> 00:00:49,206
due to family circumstances.

13
00:00:50,567 --> 00:00:51,727
We would like to wish her well

14
00:00:52,148 --> 00:00:53,148
from all of us here.

15
00:00:54,446 --> 00:01:00,871
Okay, let me give you an overview of what we're going to do in the coming hour.

16
00:01:00,932 --> 00:01:04,334
We have four amazing developers, all solo developers,

17
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:11,040
that will share their insights on the challenges and opportunities

18
00:01:12,081 --> 00:01:15,364
of doing game development by themselves.

19
00:01:16,365 --> 00:01:19,988
First, they will take turns and do a short presentation on one particular topic.

20
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:28,106
After that, after the micro talks, we will dive in deeper and talk in more detail about

21
00:01:28,146 --> 00:01:31,509
the realities of being a solo game developer.

22
00:01:32,589 --> 00:01:38,775
And after that, if time permits, we will be taking questions from the audience as well.

23
00:01:38,815 --> 00:01:40,376
There are microphones here and there.

24
00:01:41,838 --> 00:01:45,521
But I'll let you know when it's time for the questions from the audience.

25
00:01:46,754 --> 00:01:51,717
First, let me introduce to you the four solo developers on this panel.

26
00:01:52,997 --> 00:01:55,118
Joe Winter, creator of Song of Iron,

27
00:01:56,199 --> 00:01:59,400
Megan Fox, developer of Skatebird, among other titles.

28
00:02:00,181 --> 00:02:02,582
Neil Jones, creator of Aerial Nights Never Yield

29
00:02:04,383 --> 00:02:07,244
and Thomas Sala, developer of The Valkyneer.

30
00:02:08,285 --> 00:02:11,947
So to kick things off, I would like to invite Joe Winter to take the virtual stage

31
00:02:12,167 --> 00:02:15,408
and talk about starting a project. Joe.

32
00:02:17,083 --> 00:02:18,584
Hey, thank you very much for the intro.

33
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,645
And I'm super excited to be here.

34
00:02:20,665 --> 00:02:23,526
I'm gonna be talking about the beginning stages

35
00:02:23,786 --> 00:02:24,487
of development.

36
00:02:24,807 --> 00:02:27,388
And, but first I guess it's good to talk about

37
00:02:27,448 --> 00:02:29,429
why I'm here and what I've done.

38
00:02:29,449 --> 00:02:31,050
You can go to the next slide.

39
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:32,111
Who am I?

40
00:02:32,131 --> 00:02:32,851
My name is Joe Winter.

41
00:02:33,371 --> 00:02:35,792
And I've been in the game industry for 15 years now

42
00:02:35,892 --> 00:02:36,533
as an animator.

43
00:02:36,593 --> 00:02:38,254
Here's a bunch of the games that I've worked on.

44
00:02:39,254 --> 00:02:47,217
But the reason I'm in this panel, you can go to the next one, is Song of Iron, which is the game I released at the end of last year, which is my first solo project and my first indie game.

45
00:02:47,777 --> 00:02:56,060
I was really excited to work on and I used a lot of these things that I'm about to talk about to get it to be a thing that I could actually publish and release.

46
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:57,841
You can go to the next one, Thomas.

47
00:02:58,637 --> 00:03:00,738
Again, I'm talking about the beginning of the game,

48
00:03:01,058 --> 00:03:02,359
of developing a game,

49
00:03:02,559 --> 00:03:05,140
and it's one of the most exciting times to develop,

50
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,341
especially as a solo developer,

51
00:03:06,381 --> 00:03:08,722
everything is sort of to you,

52
00:03:08,782 --> 00:03:10,583
like it's all up to you to make whatever you want.

53
00:03:11,123 --> 00:03:13,284
But I think it's also one of the easiest times to quit

54
00:03:13,504 --> 00:03:15,125
and sort of leave a project behind.

55
00:03:15,225 --> 00:03:18,366
So I really want to focus on the survival tactics

56
00:03:18,406 --> 00:03:20,287
that helped me get through it for Song of Iron.

57
00:03:20,907 --> 00:03:21,728
and you go to the next one.

58
00:03:21,808 --> 00:03:23,810
The first one is art from the start.

59
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,072
This is, I, there's a various,

60
00:03:26,112 --> 00:03:27,673
there's tons of good reasons to do art

61
00:03:27,693 --> 00:03:28,694
really early on in a game,

62
00:03:28,854 --> 00:03:31,916
but as far as surviving the early development,

63
00:03:32,337 --> 00:03:33,458
I think you can go to the next one.

64
00:03:33,538 --> 00:03:36,620
It's really important because it gives you

65
00:03:37,021 --> 00:03:38,282
something tangible to look at,

66
00:03:38,322 --> 00:03:40,684
something tangible to see, to share with friends

67
00:03:40,784 --> 00:03:42,425
or the internet or whatever it might be.

68
00:03:42,946 --> 00:03:44,287
And it also, it just makes it feel like

69
00:03:44,347 --> 00:03:46,248
you're developing a game

70
00:03:46,749 --> 00:03:48,410
compared to doing a bunch of tutorials.

71
00:03:48,530 --> 00:03:49,491
If you stick with.

72
00:03:50,132 --> 00:03:54,434
you know, the Unreal mannequin or whatever sort of generic stuff,

73
00:03:54,494 --> 00:03:57,235
you can really feel like all you're doing is tutorials.

74
00:03:57,355 --> 00:04:00,577
And when you look at your game versus other stuff, it all feels the same.

75
00:04:00,637 --> 00:04:03,778
And so you won't feel as as proud of what you're working on.

76
00:04:04,299 --> 00:04:05,139
You go to the next one.

77
00:04:05,239 --> 00:04:09,041
It doesn't always have to be super elaborate art.

78
00:04:09,221 --> 00:04:11,762
This is some examples of something I'm working on the side right now.

79
00:04:11,942 --> 00:04:12,463
It's five.

80
00:04:13,183 --> 00:04:18,588
things. It's a tree, a rock, a bush, and some grass, but it's able to populate an entire

81
00:04:19,329 --> 00:04:23,533
environment. It has a mood, it has a feel, and the game kind of has an identity already.

82
00:04:24,013 --> 00:04:27,777
So if any problems come up, I can always come back to this and feel really good about what

83
00:04:27,817 --> 00:04:32,662
I'm working on, and that will keep me going through what could be hard times in the beginning stages.

84
00:04:33,582 --> 00:04:35,224
The next thing I want to talk about is limits.

85
00:04:35,244 --> 00:04:36,245
You can go to the next one, Thomas.

86
00:04:36,906 --> 00:04:39,008
Like I said, these limits will set you free.

87
00:04:39,028 --> 00:04:40,750
I think as any solo developer, we really

88
00:04:40,770 --> 00:04:43,493
have to understand that we have limitations.

89
00:04:43,533 --> 00:04:44,715
We only can do so much.

90
00:04:44,735 --> 00:04:45,556
There's only one of us.

91
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:48,940
So it's really important to do this really early on.

92
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,961
You can go to the next one.

93
00:04:51,790 --> 00:04:56,173
With Song of Iron, I set some really broad and really extreme limitations.

94
00:04:56,253 --> 00:04:57,294
I can go back one, sorry.

95
00:04:58,595 --> 00:05:02,298
Broad and some really like sort of wide reaching limitations on myself.

96
00:05:02,898 --> 00:05:05,521
No customization, no inventory, no multiplayer.

97
00:05:05,541 --> 00:05:07,242
It's going to be a side scroller.

98
00:05:07,262 --> 00:05:08,623
I wanted a linear story.

99
00:05:08,663 --> 00:05:09,644
So it was really simple.

100
00:05:10,765 --> 00:05:13,847
And so I've kind of got this really narrow pie slice left of what I could

101
00:05:13,867 --> 00:05:17,410
possibly make from a game and I can go to the next one, but as that pie slice

102
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:18,511
sort of goes outward.

103
00:05:19,151 --> 00:05:24,414
you're gonna constantly find more and more and more potential with, like, no matter how narrow

104
00:05:24,494 --> 00:05:29,737
of a scope you create, there's an infinite amount of game to be developed there. And there's a

105
00:05:29,877 --> 00:05:33,939
couple more lists of what I did for Song of Iron. So it's just like, don't be afraid of cutting

106
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:39,742
yourself off from a good experience. There is good experiences everywhere and restriction always

107
00:05:39,922 --> 00:05:43,504
makes creative things kind of blossom when you wouldn't expect it.

108
00:05:44,385 --> 00:05:50,869
And then the last thing you can go to the next one Thomas is I'm flying through this and I'm trying to do this exact thing right now which is keeping my momentum.

109
00:05:51,830 --> 00:06:00,076
This is I actually think one of the silent killers of early projects. You can go to the next one, it's just the idea that the beginning of any development.

110
00:06:00,476 --> 00:06:06,405
It's fueled by inspiration of something you've seen or excitement of making a game in general,

111
00:06:06,805 --> 00:06:11,773
and it's so easy for all that to go away if you hit a pitfall along the way.

112
00:06:12,574 --> 00:06:14,657
Sometimes this is just getting overly caught up on.

113
00:06:15,358 --> 00:06:16,398
some tech you really want.

114
00:06:16,518 --> 00:06:18,259
I remember I basically quit a project

115
00:06:18,279 --> 00:06:19,619
because I couldn't get a cape to look good.

116
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:21,620
I'd only been working on it for a few months,

117
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,741
but the week I spent on this cape

118
00:06:23,881 --> 00:06:25,902
basically took all my momentum away

119
00:06:26,242 --> 00:06:28,183
and I lost all passion for the project.

120
00:06:28,223 --> 00:06:31,424
So there's a variety of reasons this will happen,

121
00:06:31,504 --> 00:06:33,344
but I think it's really worth being aware of.

122
00:06:34,105 --> 00:06:37,887
and watching out for yourself getting stuck anywhere so that you can move on to something

123
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:42,189
else. Do some art, which works great for the first point. Do some other system,

124
00:06:42,229 --> 00:06:46,131
whatever it might be. Watch out for those things you can trip over early in development.

125
00:06:48,152 --> 00:06:52,474
And again, these are really fast micro talks, so that's it. We're moving along. But it's just,

126
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:56,896
I think those three things are huge key things that kept me going at the beginning stages of

127
00:06:56,936 --> 00:07:03,279
Song of Iron and honestly built towards making the game a success for me in the long run. Thanks.

128
00:07:05,096 --> 00:07:05,356
All right.

129
00:07:10,958 --> 00:07:11,298
All right.

130
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:12,658
Thank you, Joe.

131
00:07:12,698 --> 00:07:15,479
You really put the micro in the microtalk here.

132
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,520
Race through it.

133
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:18,300
All right.

134
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:19,101
Thank you.

135
00:07:19,141 --> 00:07:20,581
We will go over to Megan Fox.

136
00:07:20,601 --> 00:07:22,342
She will talk about platform deals.

137
00:07:22,762 --> 00:07:23,042
Megan.

138
00:07:23,742 --> 00:07:24,042
So yeah.

139
00:07:24,162 --> 00:07:24,422
Hello.

140
00:07:24,642 --> 00:07:25,383
I'm Megan Fox.

141
00:07:25,603 --> 00:07:28,124
I'm glassbottommeg on Twitter.

142
00:07:28,264 --> 00:07:30,064
I made Skatebird go to Skatebird Rocks.

143
00:07:30,084 --> 00:07:30,784
You want to learn more?

144
00:07:30,824 --> 00:07:31,645
You've probably heard of it.

145
00:07:32,572 --> 00:07:34,093
I would be a score, yadda yadda yadda.

146
00:07:34,393 --> 00:07:37,495
Anyways, I worked, used to be AAA.

147
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:38,955
I worked there for three years.

148
00:07:39,015 --> 00:07:42,577
That was Playwell Studios, and it was also NetDevil,

149
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,097
and there was some other name.

150
00:07:44,538 --> 00:07:45,358
Went through a lot of names.

151
00:07:46,278 --> 00:07:48,019
Made LEGO Universe, if you remember that.

152
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:48,940
That's about it, though.

153
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:51,821
Then I've been indie ever since, about 10 years.

154
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:55,082
My first game was Jones on Fire,

155
00:07:55,122 --> 00:07:57,303
which was totally solo, except for, I think, music.

156
00:07:58,282 --> 00:08:00,262
After that was Hot Tin Roof, which was less solo,

157
00:08:00,342 --> 00:08:02,803
Spartan Fist, a bit more solo, and Skatebird,

158
00:08:02,923 --> 00:08:05,905
which is less solo but started more solo.

159
00:08:06,265 --> 00:08:10,567
A lot of my stuff is, the way I start is I try to neck it

160
00:08:10,607 --> 00:08:12,547
down to a point where I can make this game on my own

161
00:08:12,567 --> 00:08:15,148
if I need to, and then based on initial hype,

162
00:08:15,689 --> 00:08:18,110
I will pull on contractors or whatever to do

163
00:08:18,150 --> 00:08:20,110
that little piece of work that I can't do myself.

164
00:08:21,091 --> 00:08:23,152
A lot of other solo developers might instead use

165
00:08:23,332 --> 00:08:25,192
asset store stuff, which also works

166
00:08:25,212 --> 00:08:25,993
if that's what your preference is.

167
00:08:27,776 --> 00:08:29,296
Also, it's usually cheaper to do that,

168
00:08:30,657 --> 00:08:32,297
but it just kind of depends on the kind of person you are,

169
00:08:32,337 --> 00:08:34,358
which brings us to platform deals.

170
00:08:37,298 --> 00:08:41,319
What Joe was talking about with making it pretty first

171
00:08:41,499 --> 00:08:42,520
and how that helps him,

172
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:45,801
it'll also help you with platform deals.

173
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:49,321
Generally speaking, you want to make a polished prototype.

174
00:08:49,341 --> 00:08:50,582
You want to do marketing first,

175
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:51,702
which was a talk I just did,

176
00:08:51,742 --> 00:08:53,883
which basically just means make it pretty

177
00:08:53,943 --> 00:08:55,163
and make it look like a complete game

178
00:08:55,203 --> 00:08:56,503
before you start showing to other people

179
00:08:56,543 --> 00:08:57,263
so that they can...

180
00:08:58,060 --> 00:09:00,601
kind of anchor in the idea that this is a complete game,

181
00:09:00,661 --> 00:09:03,101
it's huge and big, instead of seeing the shitty prototype

182
00:09:03,161 --> 00:09:04,942
and having to imagine how this is going

183
00:09:04,962 --> 00:09:06,022
to become something larger.

184
00:09:07,362 --> 00:09:09,103
It also helps before you have a deal,

185
00:09:09,123 --> 00:09:10,203
if you've got some amount of buzz.

186
00:09:10,443 --> 00:09:11,783
That doesn't mean you have to have a lot of buzz,

187
00:09:11,803 --> 00:09:13,804
but if you've at least announced something that looks pretty

188
00:09:14,224 --> 00:09:16,724
and looks like a complete game, even if it very much isn't,

189
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:20,685
you'll have an easier time talking to platforms

190
00:09:20,725 --> 00:09:22,826
because you can say, look at this thing, which theoretically

191
00:09:22,866 --> 00:09:24,606
exists, and you understand it, instead of.

192
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:28,530
look at these two cubes which are awkwardly bumping into each other, I promise this is

193
00:09:28,570 --> 00:09:35,676
going to be a great game. Give me $300,000. That's a much harder conversation. Also, platform fit

194
00:09:35,716 --> 00:09:42,702
matters. So obviously, what Apple cares about is different from what Xbox cares about. Sony,

195
00:09:42,822 --> 00:09:46,125
you might think they're identical to Xbox, but no, what the kind of game that Sony cares about

196
00:09:46,185 --> 00:09:51,009
is very different from the kind of game Xbox cares about. They all have their own style and vibe.

197
00:09:51,588 --> 00:09:54,588
and you kind of need to pick your targets well.

198
00:09:54,808 --> 00:09:56,349
That doesn't mean that you shouldn't like throw a wide net

199
00:09:56,369 --> 00:09:59,089
and try everyone, but you're more likely to get

200
00:09:59,129 --> 00:10:00,850
with whichever platform is closest

201
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:02,190
to the vibe you're considering.

202
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:03,430
So look at the other games they funded

203
00:10:04,110 --> 00:10:07,551
and try to work out what they tend to like.

204
00:10:07,791 --> 00:10:09,771
Usually you can figure something out from that.

205
00:10:10,451 --> 00:10:11,652
Now, how to make the approach.

206
00:10:12,232 --> 00:10:16,172
That's going to be, well, if you have a friend,

207
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:17,133
that really helps.

208
00:10:17,433 --> 00:10:20,373
That's generally going to be somebody

209
00:10:20,393 --> 00:10:21,273
who's made a deal before.

210
00:10:22,405 --> 00:10:25,285
If you know someone like this, you probably do.

211
00:10:25,305 --> 00:10:26,145
And if you don't, you don't.

212
00:10:26,226 --> 00:10:27,686
So harping on this isn't useful.

213
00:10:28,306 --> 00:10:30,546
You can also approach at a convention with a demo.

214
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:31,527
This is a little harder.

215
00:10:31,967 --> 00:10:35,187
Your pitch better be fucking locked in perfect

216
00:10:35,667 --> 00:10:37,728
because you're gonna get disregarded really quickly

217
00:10:37,768 --> 00:10:38,768
if you're not careful.

218
00:10:40,268 --> 00:10:43,149
Usually you're not looking for like a big two-hour demo

219
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:43,649
at this point.

220
00:10:43,689 --> 00:10:46,029
You're looking for like it sells the game in 30 seconds

221
00:10:46,129 --> 00:10:48,090
and maybe there's five to 10 more minutes of gameplay

222
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:48,570
if they care.

223
00:10:49,351 --> 00:10:51,392
Because if you can get people to sit with you that long,

224
00:10:51,592 --> 00:10:52,412
it's going to be amazing.

225
00:10:52,992 --> 00:10:54,353
Usually this kind of meeting is something

226
00:10:54,373 --> 00:10:56,094
you set up ahead of time with a platform person, which

227
00:10:56,114 --> 00:10:57,694
you've hopefully interacted with an email.

228
00:10:58,755 --> 00:11:01,056
And it'll be a coffee meeting, that kind of thing.

229
00:11:01,316 --> 00:11:03,416
And theoretically, the block will say 30 minutes,

230
00:11:03,436 --> 00:11:05,257
but you've got like five maybe.

231
00:11:05,337 --> 00:11:07,238
So again, pitch better be locked down.

232
00:11:08,198 --> 00:11:11,940
Your other option is to be a licensed platform dev

233
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:15,281
and then cold email the part, the group in question.

234
00:11:16,021 --> 00:11:17,322
And good luck.

235
00:11:17,662 --> 00:11:18,182
This can work.

236
00:11:19,136 --> 00:11:20,397
If you need help finding these emails,

237
00:11:20,477 --> 00:11:22,097
again, talk to someone who's done the deal before.

238
00:11:22,577 --> 00:11:24,818
But you really want an intro if possible.

239
00:11:25,138 --> 00:11:26,359
So yeah.

240
00:11:27,459 --> 00:11:30,820
Now as far as these deals look, there's variance in this.

241
00:11:31,301 --> 00:11:34,582
Most of them are going to be limited to no upfront

242
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:39,624
and all back end, which means Xbox or Sony or Amazon

243
00:11:39,664 --> 00:11:41,885
might say, we will give you the $100,000

244
00:11:42,185 --> 00:11:44,566
or whatever when the game launches, which

245
00:11:44,586 --> 00:11:48,307
means you have to get from here to there without that money.

246
00:11:48,950 --> 00:11:49,911
There's a bunch of ways of doing that.

247
00:11:49,991 --> 00:11:51,432
I've used Kickstarter in the past.

248
00:11:51,532 --> 00:11:55,534
Your strategies may vary, but you generally

249
00:11:55,574 --> 00:11:57,496
need to plan for this if you're going for platform money.

250
00:11:58,056 --> 00:11:59,217
That doesn't make it impossible, but it

251
00:11:59,257 --> 00:12:03,539
does mean that your strategy needs to consider that.

252
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,661
Also remember that some deals can overlap and some don't.

253
00:12:07,422 --> 00:12:09,603
So don't go pissing off one platform

254
00:12:09,643 --> 00:12:10,484
because you think you're going to get

255
00:12:10,504 --> 00:12:13,166
to deal with another platform.

256
00:12:13,286 --> 00:12:16,768
Clearly, you might think Sony and Xbox don't overlap.

257
00:12:16,980 --> 00:12:18,161
That's not necessarily true.

258
00:12:18,261 --> 00:12:19,142
It depends which deal.

259
00:12:21,384 --> 00:12:22,525
And even Apple and other stuff.

260
00:12:22,605 --> 00:12:23,666
Apple, it's harder to get to

261
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:24,667
if you don't start with them first,

262
00:12:24,747 --> 00:12:26,088
but often that can go to other places.

263
00:12:26,108 --> 00:12:28,971
So again, don't burn bridges, just don't.

264
00:12:30,172 --> 00:12:32,394
Which is pretty much the gist of how to do,

265
00:12:33,235 --> 00:12:33,896
how these deals work.

266
00:12:33,956 --> 00:12:35,517
More detail, you know, is more involved,

267
00:12:35,557 --> 00:12:37,279
but five minute macro talk, so yeah.

268
00:12:39,861 --> 00:12:40,042
All right.

269
00:12:44,942 --> 00:12:46,042
All right. Thank you, Megan.

270
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:50,363
And now it's time for Neil Jones and his presentation on porting. Neil.

271
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:52,984
Yo, what's good, everybody?

272
00:12:53,944 --> 00:12:54,725
Thanks for being here.

273
00:12:54,745 --> 00:12:57,946
I want to shout out Joe and Megan. Those presentations are awesome.

274
00:12:58,026 --> 00:13:01,787
I agree with everything they said, but, you know, in a more deep,

275
00:13:01,867 --> 00:13:03,007
sexy black man voice.

276
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:09,970
So, yeah, can you go to the next slide for me, please?

277
00:13:12,195 --> 00:13:13,596
Oh no, that one.

278
00:13:13,796 --> 00:13:14,696
Yeah, so I'm Neil.

279
00:13:14,816 --> 00:13:16,157
I go by Aerial Knight online.

280
00:13:16,277 --> 00:13:18,277
I created this game called Aerial Knights Never Yield.

281
00:13:18,578 --> 00:13:19,958
It's a super dope, amazing game.

282
00:13:20,898 --> 00:13:21,859
I'm super amazing.

283
00:13:22,059 --> 00:13:23,319
Everything about it is amazing.

284
00:13:23,339 --> 00:13:24,820
You should definitely check it out.

285
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:29,421
But no, I came from, you know,

286
00:13:29,601 --> 00:13:31,722
just a student type of background,

287
00:13:31,762 --> 00:13:33,703
just like I'm sure most of you in the audience.

288
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:38,161
where I tried for 10 years to get into the game industry. It's really rough. It's really hard.

289
00:13:38,841 --> 00:13:45,744
It's a struggle. You know that. So I kind of made the pivot to trying to make games by myself.

290
00:13:46,624 --> 00:13:51,386
So like what was previously stated, I started off just trying to make something simple,

291
00:13:51,446 --> 00:13:56,809
something I could do by myself. And I went through the processes that were just explained.

292
00:13:57,609 --> 00:14:00,150
And I made it to the point where I was ready to do ports.

293
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,021
I landed a publisher.

294
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:04,682
I had this dope trailer.

295
00:14:04,723 --> 00:14:06,043
Everybody was hyped about my game.

296
00:14:06,383 --> 00:14:08,645
But now I had to get it onto all these platforms.

297
00:14:08,685 --> 00:14:11,266
And as you see on the slide, Never Yield.

298
00:14:12,289 --> 00:14:19,354
made it onto the Epic Game Store, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, Steam, PlayStation is coming out later

299
00:14:19,394 --> 00:14:23,617
this week on mobile devices or next week. I don't know what day it is. It doesn't matter.

300
00:14:24,138 --> 00:14:31,143
But it's coming out on mobile devices as well. The important thing that the thing I want you

301
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:37,188
to take away from porting is that it sucks. It's terrible and it is the worst experience.

302
00:14:38,110 --> 00:14:39,736
because you would think that it's easy.

303
00:14:40,177 --> 00:14:42,063
If you look online, it's just, you know,

304
00:14:42,104 --> 00:14:43,508
hit the button and it's done.

305
00:14:44,547 --> 00:14:48,029
But no, each of these platforms have really specific requests,

306
00:14:48,950 --> 00:14:52,892
not even just as far as code and making sure

307
00:14:52,932 --> 00:14:56,154
that it works on the platforms, but as far as marketing,

308
00:14:56,515 --> 00:15:01,818
as far as your contact with the person who

309
00:15:02,078 --> 00:15:04,239
is your direct contact for that platform.

310
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,501
You need specific trailers.

311
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,503
There's rules, and all of the platforms have different rules.

312
00:15:11,544 --> 00:15:13,285
It's just a really rough experience.

313
00:15:14,230 --> 00:15:17,912
So one, only go down that route if you have to,

314
00:15:18,352 --> 00:15:21,613
and two, start with a base platform.

315
00:15:21,653 --> 00:15:24,855
Base platforms, I like to think of it as like Pokemon.

316
00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:27,896
Like, pick a base platform that you're happy with

317
00:15:27,936 --> 00:15:29,637
because you're gonna be stuck with it for a while.

318
00:15:30,877 --> 00:15:33,198
But if you go on to the next slide for me, please.

319
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:37,019
The pros and the cons.

320
00:15:37,039 --> 00:15:39,582
The pros, everybody knows pros.

321
00:15:39,622 --> 00:15:41,044
More platforms, more revenue.

322
00:15:42,225 --> 00:15:44,067
But the cons is, is it worth it?

323
00:15:45,029 --> 00:15:46,931
Do you want to put all of your energy

324
00:15:47,292 --> 00:15:50,536
into launching on PlayStation at the same time

325
00:15:50,596 --> 00:15:52,498
as you're launching it on mobile?

326
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,620
because there's going to be a price difference.

327
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,461
There's a different audience.

328
00:15:57,202 --> 00:16:00,504
You have to juggle both of those communities at the same time.

329
00:16:01,285 --> 00:16:03,166
And, you know, community management

330
00:16:03,206 --> 00:16:04,487
and talking about the game

331
00:16:04,668 --> 00:16:07,250
also ties heavily into the platforms.

332
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,231
When do you want to launch on mobile?

333
00:16:09,251 --> 00:16:10,672
When do you want to launch on Switch?

334
00:16:11,052 --> 00:16:12,954
Do you want to do all of these at the same time?

335
00:16:13,654 --> 00:16:14,595
Are you going to do this alone

336
00:16:14,755 --> 00:16:16,377
or are you going to hire people to help you?

337
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:19,379
And you can go on to the next slide for me, please.

338
00:16:21,361 --> 00:16:23,922
Um, so yeah, I listed out a bunch of reasons.

339
00:16:24,002 --> 00:16:27,864
These, this not even have the reasons, uh, why, why porting sucks.

340
00:16:28,584 --> 00:16:32,685
Um, but you know, you have to track bugs, update the game and like all of

341
00:16:32,705 --> 00:16:36,827
these updates, uh, aren't one-to-one, even if they're on a similar platform

342
00:16:36,867 --> 00:16:39,268
like steam and, uh, Epic game store.

343
00:16:39,808 --> 00:16:43,850
Uh, just because it's a PC doesn't mean that the store fronts, uh, support

344
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:44,630
the same kind of.

345
00:16:46,091 --> 00:16:50,037
way to update it. So it's work no matter what platform you're doing these updates for.

346
00:16:50,457 --> 00:16:54,744
So if you launch on five different platforms, there's five different versions of your game

347
00:16:54,784 --> 00:16:59,310
that needs to be made. And each of them might have different bugs, and you have to track

348
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:00,712
what's going wrong where.

349
00:17:02,496 --> 00:17:09,261
And a really important thing that a lot of people try to keep track of is just keeping the experience the same.

350
00:17:09,621 --> 00:17:18,088
That's a big struggle I faced with doing multiple platforms, making sure that the experience was the same from the Switch to the PlayStation to mobile.

351
00:17:19,469 --> 00:17:23,151
And again, there's different rules.

352
00:17:23,531 --> 00:17:25,493
So the Switch doesn't have achievements

353
00:17:25,553 --> 00:17:29,575
and trophy hunting, but PlayStation does, and Xbox does.

354
00:17:29,875 --> 00:17:31,436
Are those achievements gonna be the same?

355
00:17:31,476 --> 00:17:32,477
Are they gonna be different?

356
00:17:32,577 --> 00:17:36,119
Or what is easier, what's harder to do?

357
00:17:36,959 --> 00:17:38,500
And if one achievement doesn't work,

358
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:42,843
as people who play my game, you have to address that,

359
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:44,564
even if it's just for one platform.

360
00:17:46,561 --> 00:17:50,745
And launching at the same time. This is the biggest sticking point.

361
00:17:51,585 --> 00:17:57,250
From my experience, I don't think I would want to launch a game on multiple platforms more than to

362
00:17:57,950 --> 00:18:03,515
at the same time again as a solo developer. I had help from a publisher to get to the point

363
00:18:03,555 --> 00:18:06,698
where I could launch on multiple platforms. But even with that,

364
00:18:07,078 --> 00:18:12,820
it was still an extreme hassle and put more of a burden on me

365
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:16,302
unnecessarily when I could have done a rolling launch.

366
00:18:17,002 --> 00:18:19,243
Launching on multiple platforms at the same time

367
00:18:19,543 --> 00:18:21,884
is a really big burden to put on yourself.

368
00:18:22,624 --> 00:18:26,846
And if you can, I would say just pick one or two platforms,

369
00:18:26,886 --> 00:18:30,407
start with that, track the bugs, get all your fixes out the way,

370
00:18:30,547 --> 00:18:32,388
and then launch on your next platforms.

371
00:18:33,722 --> 00:18:36,384
I'm almost done. Can you go to the next slide for me?

372
00:18:37,244 --> 00:18:44,670
Asking for help. As solo developers, we want to be, you know, that fantasy of I did it all by myself, you know, I did it with no help.

373
00:18:44,750 --> 00:18:50,114
I'm this master coder, master artist. You know, I'm that person. I'm that dev.

374
00:18:52,235 --> 00:18:54,499
But it's not bad to ask for help.

375
00:18:54,579 --> 00:18:59,186
I think all of us get help in some form, be it the asset

376
00:18:59,206 --> 00:19:02,912
store, or when it comes to porting, or getting trailers

377
00:19:02,972 --> 00:19:05,676
made, we're getting help some way, somehow, anyway.

378
00:19:05,997 --> 00:19:07,098
So if you're doing porting.

379
00:19:08,203 --> 00:19:12,549
there's no harm in reaching out to a smaller studio

380
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:15,113
or another individual who can help you with that burden.

381
00:19:15,133 --> 00:19:17,376
So you can put more of your focus on marketing,

382
00:19:17,697 --> 00:19:20,400
which is something that indie devs are terrible at.

383
00:19:21,442 --> 00:19:23,264
And you can go to the last slide for me.

384
00:19:24,899 --> 00:19:29,640
So yeah, just to sum it all up, just choose your starting platform wisely.

385
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:35,282
Remember to Pokemon reference, uh, take your time, uh, so that you can focus on

386
00:19:35,322 --> 00:19:38,643
the platforms you did launch on, um, and you know, take your time

387
00:19:38,823 --> 00:19:40,503
rolling it out for other platforms.

388
00:19:40,904 --> 00:19:45,425
My, uh, my mobile version is launching a year after the base version.

389
00:19:46,105 --> 00:19:47,545
Um, and, uh, get help.

390
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:51,026
And it's, it's always cool to just reach out to people and ask for help.

391
00:19:51,466 --> 00:19:51,707
Thanks.

392
00:19:58,936 --> 00:20:00,056
All right, thanks, Neil.

393
00:20:01,017 --> 00:20:02,197
Thanks.

394
00:20:02,397 --> 00:20:04,298
And to talk about that post-launch period,

395
00:20:04,338 --> 00:20:05,379
here's Thomas Sala.

396
00:20:05,399 --> 00:20:07,640
Hi, everybody.

397
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:09,601
I'm Thomas Sala.

398
00:20:10,041 --> 00:20:11,682
I created a game called The Falconeer.

399
00:20:12,022 --> 00:20:14,703
And I'm busy creating another game called The Falconeer

400
00:20:14,743 --> 00:20:15,183
Bulwark.

401
00:20:17,024 --> 00:20:18,364
I've been in the industry a long time,

402
00:20:18,805 --> 00:20:23,007
doing all these side jobs, work for hire kind of stuff.

403
00:20:23,647 --> 00:20:26,428
Ended up doing a lot of VR, mobile games,

404
00:20:26,768 --> 00:20:28,569
serious games, educational games, even.

405
00:20:29,810 --> 00:20:32,092
I am from the Netherlands, so sorry for the accent.

406
00:20:34,034 --> 00:20:37,737
I co-founded the studio back in 2001 before self-publishing.

407
00:20:38,418 --> 00:20:43,123
So at some point I got really inspired by all the Indies

408
00:20:43,423 --> 00:20:46,145
and what everybody else was doing and I went, I want that.

409
00:20:48,428 --> 00:20:50,149
Eventually I did. It's an interesting journey.

410
00:20:53,057 --> 00:20:56,119
I kind of started that by doing modding for Skyrim.

411
00:20:56,839 --> 00:20:59,241
That's how 12 years ago, 10 years, 10 years ago.

412
00:20:59,901 --> 00:21:01,102
I also don't like texture.

413
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:05,864
So that's something I'm talking about tomorrow in another talk.

414
00:21:07,826 --> 00:21:10,007
I'm going to talk about what happens after release.

415
00:21:10,067 --> 00:21:11,468
So you finish your game.

416
00:21:12,068 --> 00:21:12,728
You've ported it.

417
00:21:13,009 --> 00:21:14,930
You might even have had a platform deal.

418
00:21:16,675 --> 00:21:18,276
And now it's going out into the world.

419
00:21:18,857 --> 00:21:19,877
So let me start off with the first thing.

420
00:21:20,058 --> 00:21:23,120
If you ever finish the game and release the game, you need to give yourself

421
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,562
an applause because that is a momentous achievement.

422
00:21:27,783 --> 00:21:30,685
And that is something that often gets lost

423
00:21:31,005 --> 00:21:34,048
because there is no such thing as a good launch.

424
00:21:34,348 --> 00:21:37,890
I've there's a magical, magical thing of a perfect launch.

425
00:21:38,371 --> 00:21:39,511
I've never seen it ever.

426
00:21:41,998 --> 00:21:47,160
When you release a game, it's going to impact you by the nature of being by yourself,

427
00:21:47,580 --> 00:21:51,441
regardless if you have a publisher, a great family, a support network,

428
00:21:51,881 --> 00:21:52,762
you're going to get hit.

429
00:21:55,143 --> 00:21:56,783
And things will go wrong, you know.

430
00:21:58,184 --> 00:21:58,964
It is a given.

431
00:21:59,624 --> 00:22:03,066
Part of that, which is going to happen, that if you are by yourself,

432
00:22:03,146 --> 00:22:05,787
and I've found this distinct from working in a studio,

433
00:22:06,467 --> 00:22:08,968
is that your expectations are going wild.

434
00:22:09,450 --> 00:22:14,615
When you're together with a group, you can moderate each other, you know, you can get realism.

435
00:22:15,075 --> 00:22:19,419
If you're by yourself, you're going to walk down the street after your game is done, before it's launched,

436
00:22:19,439 --> 00:22:21,541
and think, I'm getting a game award.

437
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:26,545
It's just your mind is going, imagining all the stuff that might happen, and then you're not allowing your...

438
00:22:27,306 --> 00:22:27,486
Okay.

439
00:22:28,747 --> 00:22:32,190
Also, again, I hear there's emotionally stable people.

440
00:22:32,630 --> 00:22:33,571
I am not one of those.

441
00:22:33,591 --> 00:22:37,034
So if you're super stable, this is not, you know...

442
00:22:38,592 --> 00:22:45,217
Excellent. So your expectations will never match reality, no matter how good the reality is.

443
00:22:46,138 --> 00:22:52,202
We will always look, but yeah, this other guy, he sold a million or this guy or person or she sold

444
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:59,427
10,000 copies. I'm only selling a thousand copies. There is, you know, that is, and it is, it is

445
00:22:59,967 --> 00:23:05,211
momentous. You can't run away from that. And it will hurt you and it will cause, how do you call it?

446
00:23:06,421 --> 00:23:10,164
emotional situations we need to deal with and affect your mental health basically.

447
00:23:10,544 --> 00:23:15,569
To be honest, when I launched the Falconeer and it was an Xbox launch title in 2020, I spent

448
00:23:17,951 --> 00:23:24,496
a week or longer just on the couch under a blanket, shaking. And this actually happened.

449
00:23:24,876 --> 00:23:29,540
You know, part of that is your own expectations. Things go wrong, you see your own mistakes,

450
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:32,423
you are your own worst enemy. You will see every mistake you make.

451
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:39,172
Then you have reviews. I make the joke, you know, a good review goes like poof, it's great.

452
00:23:39,312 --> 00:23:40,854
Oh, a little endorphin. Oh, someone liked it.

453
00:23:40,934 --> 00:23:43,959
And a bad review stays with you for days.

454
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:48,966
So, and you will always have bad reviews and you will always have good reviews.

455
00:23:50,380 --> 00:23:53,042
So that becomes, you know, the more successful you are,

456
00:23:53,062 --> 00:23:54,163
the more reviews you get.

457
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:55,924
It doesn't matter if it's a user review,

458
00:23:56,364 --> 00:23:57,946
or you go on Reddit, because you're gonna,

459
00:23:58,426 --> 00:24:00,447
and search your own game and find someone it sucks.

460
00:24:01,448 --> 00:24:01,929
Doesn't matter.

461
00:24:02,209 --> 00:24:03,970
Each one of those is a cumulative hit,

462
00:24:04,571 --> 00:24:05,431
and you're by yourself.

463
00:24:06,572 --> 00:24:09,835
And like I said, there's no personal distance,

464
00:24:10,155 --> 00:24:12,417
because you're also the only one responsible.

465
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:15,199
If you are in a group, you can help each other

466
00:24:15,239 --> 00:24:16,920
and say, you know, okay, it's the art,

467
00:24:16,980 --> 00:24:17,921
or it's the publisher.

468
00:24:17,981 --> 00:24:18,742
You can blame someone.

469
00:24:19,105 --> 00:24:21,307
If you're by yourself, you're gonna blame yourself.

470
00:24:21,967 --> 00:24:22,508
And it'd be true.

471
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:24,629
That bug, that killed it.

472
00:24:25,149 --> 00:24:27,771
I launched, got sick, fixed the AI,

473
00:24:27,871 --> 00:24:29,212
but accidentally made them killer.

474
00:24:29,592 --> 00:24:31,353
So that showed up in the reviews.

475
00:24:32,234 --> 00:24:33,415
No one to blame but myself.

476
00:24:33,495 --> 00:24:36,377
And said that, you know, quickly fix this before,

477
00:24:36,397 --> 00:24:38,738
you know, with the final update, before it goes into cert.

478
00:24:39,219 --> 00:24:40,039
Nah, I should have done that.

479
00:24:41,020 --> 00:24:42,981
So everything will hit on a personal level.

480
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,362
This is also your art.

481
00:24:44,802 --> 00:24:46,203
Well, I'm a big favorite saying.

482
00:24:46,537 --> 00:24:49,058
This is not art like that, art with a big A.

483
00:24:49,259 --> 00:24:50,099
You're making something.

484
00:24:50,499 --> 00:24:53,261
It is your emotional expression into the world,

485
00:24:53,782 --> 00:24:54,602
and there will be pain.

486
00:24:55,183 --> 00:24:57,144
So a good thing to do, I have no other than,

487
00:24:57,244 --> 00:24:58,185
is prepare for this.

488
00:24:58,425 --> 00:24:59,246
Know it will happen.

489
00:25:00,006 --> 00:25:01,187
If it's big or small, you know,

490
00:25:01,247 --> 00:25:02,608
if it's just your first itch game,

491
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:05,050
you will have all these things happen.

492
00:25:05,731 --> 00:25:07,031
You know, if it's your, you know,

493
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:08,953
you got a platform deal and you're going to E3,

494
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,255
for me, I think it will always happen.

495
00:25:12,868 --> 00:25:14,048
So make space for them.

496
00:25:14,228 --> 00:25:16,128
Find a support network and figure out

497
00:25:16,168 --> 00:25:17,929
how to survive that.

498
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,249
I think it's something we should say at organizations

499
00:25:21,429 --> 00:25:23,610
like GDC, mental health is important.

500
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:25,790
And we need to figure out how to do that.

501
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,211
So that's one.

502
00:25:28,571 --> 00:25:30,111
So then you've launched.

503
00:25:31,051 --> 00:25:33,691
You've waken up after two weeks, read all the reviews,

504
00:25:34,672 --> 00:25:35,212
and you want to run.

505
00:25:35,232 --> 00:25:38,292
But you've got to be a good dev.

506
00:25:38,312 --> 00:25:39,893
You've got to support your game.

507
00:25:40,313 --> 00:25:40,953
And you've got to grow it.

508
00:25:41,546 --> 00:25:44,528
We live in a games as a service world.

509
00:25:44,928 --> 00:25:47,550
And I've said this, it's easier to do games as a server

510
00:25:47,610 --> 00:25:48,191
if it's just you.

511
00:25:48,371 --> 00:25:50,072
There's no committee, nobody's there.

512
00:25:50,092 --> 00:25:53,554
A bug comes in, you see it, you fix it, you update it,

513
00:25:54,015 --> 00:25:57,577
and you send it off for certification, if you're on console.

514
00:25:58,598 --> 00:26:01,660
That is a mixed bag, because it requires you to open up

515
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:03,802
to all the negativity that's come and come.

516
00:26:04,142 --> 00:26:06,463
And the most useful things are the worst one.

517
00:26:07,444 --> 00:26:10,106
The worst bug you made, another person said,

518
00:26:10,577 --> 00:26:12,938
Thomas, you know, your mouse and keyboard sucks.

519
00:26:12,998 --> 00:26:13,999
Why did I buy this game?

520
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,640
Because Thomas made it on console.

521
00:26:18,842 --> 00:26:21,503
The thing is, you start talking and figure out

522
00:26:22,123 --> 00:26:22,804
you have to listen.

523
00:26:23,324 --> 00:26:24,705
And that hurts.

524
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:27,466
So that is another thing, which is prepare yourself.

525
00:26:27,666 --> 00:26:29,987
And my advice to some people is just don't do anything.

526
00:26:30,027 --> 00:26:30,648
Just hide.

527
00:26:31,788 --> 00:26:33,969
I'll get to that in the last slide, why I don't

528
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:35,010
feel you should do that.

529
00:26:36,671 --> 00:26:37,691
There is a positive there.

530
00:26:38,412 --> 00:26:39,132
There's trolling.

531
00:26:39,548 --> 00:26:44,612
their stuff, you will find comments on your Steam reviews that will make you go, that

532
00:26:44,772 --> 00:26:50,477
won't go out one year and you know, that will remain with you and keep you going, you know.

533
00:26:52,498 --> 00:26:53,559
And that is, you know.

534
00:26:54,843 --> 00:26:57,565
I don't have, we don't have time for examples, but you will find them.

535
00:26:57,685 --> 00:27:00,767
And so you cherish them and you know, you thank them.

536
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:03,568
And they will help.

537
00:27:04,168 --> 00:27:06,229
So going in isn't all evil.

538
00:27:06,269 --> 00:27:07,630
You know, you can find great people.

539
00:27:07,710 --> 00:27:09,291
They'll come to your discord and will help.

540
00:27:11,292 --> 00:27:12,933
And like I said, it's a development.

541
00:27:13,213 --> 00:27:16,915
You've spent a year, two years, three years, four years, five years in a bubble.

542
00:27:17,195 --> 00:27:19,556
It's just you and your this is going to be amazing.

543
00:27:19,937 --> 00:27:21,217
And trying to hype yourself up.

544
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:23,999
You're gonna be, you know, all the stuff Joe said,

545
00:27:24,059 --> 00:27:25,441
it's gonna go bad, you're gonna get stuck,

546
00:27:25,481 --> 00:27:28,084
and then you're there, you've been in a bubble,

547
00:27:28,304 --> 00:27:29,606
and then you have to go out.

548
00:27:29,966 --> 00:27:32,269
So that bubble's gonna burst regardless

549
00:27:32,309 --> 00:27:33,651
because it's artificial.

550
00:27:35,934 --> 00:27:37,676
After if you don't have all the support for the Falconeer,

551
00:27:37,736 --> 00:27:38,016
I've done.

552
00:27:38,867 --> 00:27:41,108
dozens of updates, a bunch of DLC,

553
00:27:41,448 --> 00:27:43,848
and suddenly, you know, some things actually help your sales.

554
00:27:43,868 --> 00:27:45,229
You can actually, you know, it gets better

555
00:27:45,329 --> 00:27:47,749
if you have bundles and special editions.

556
00:27:48,069 --> 00:27:50,070
And when you have more DLC and more updates,

557
00:27:50,490 --> 00:27:51,330
people will enjoy it.

558
00:27:51,450 --> 00:27:53,511
And you know, you get to be a good dev

559
00:27:53,691 --> 00:27:54,971
because there's nothing that people,

560
00:27:55,831 --> 00:27:57,132
when people, someone comes to you,

561
00:27:57,252 --> 00:27:58,472
this sucks because it's buggy,

562
00:27:58,972 --> 00:28:00,272
they actually want it to be fixed.

563
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,353
And if you then fix it, you know,

564
00:28:02,433 --> 00:28:03,913
they can try to love what you made.

565
00:28:04,474 --> 00:28:06,514
So you've done all that.

566
00:28:07,479 --> 00:28:09,801
then you need to prepare graciously to detach.

567
00:28:10,041 --> 00:28:11,423
At some point you need to make a new game

568
00:28:11,943 --> 00:28:14,725
and there's a graceful exit at some point.

569
00:28:16,186 --> 00:28:17,167
I don't know how to do that.

570
00:28:17,367 --> 00:28:20,049
It's just slowly drift off and do it.

571
00:28:20,750 --> 00:28:23,652
But I like to think that I can do some things graciously.

572
00:28:24,353 --> 00:28:27,135
And what I want to end with, because I'm not as fast,

573
00:28:28,756 --> 00:28:29,777
when you're a solid development,

574
00:28:29,997 --> 00:28:31,438
everything you make is yours.

575
00:28:32,496 --> 00:28:35,679
You are not spinning off stuff that, you know, let's see if it sticks.

576
00:28:35,859 --> 00:28:37,721
You know, that's the term we use in the games.

577
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:40,403
Let's make a demo, see a prototype, see if it sticks.

578
00:28:41,224 --> 00:28:44,787
But, you know, I've consciously chosen to call myself Tomasala and not,

579
00:28:45,187 --> 00:28:46,729
you know, whatever studio, it's just me.

580
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:52,013
You're building an over, I don't know how to say it in American.

581
00:28:52,794 --> 00:28:54,115
You're building on yourself.

582
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,157
And everybody that's going to go back in history

583
00:28:56,497 --> 00:28:57,899
is going to see every game you made.

584
00:28:58,709 --> 00:29:01,454
So it's not about firing, forgetting.

585
00:29:01,534 --> 00:29:05,160
It's about building out your catalog so that people come from you.

586
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,663
Because that is you are.

587
00:29:06,803 --> 00:29:07,645
And I like to say.

588
00:29:08,243 --> 00:29:10,084
I aspire to be something like a fantasy author.

589
00:29:10,605 --> 00:29:12,165
You love your favorite fantasy authors.

590
00:29:12,526 --> 00:29:14,227
They make seven book deals

591
00:29:14,567 --> 00:29:15,767
because they know people come back

592
00:29:15,907 --> 00:29:16,848
and one of the books in the middle

593
00:29:16,868 --> 00:29:18,809
might be not as good, not to your liking,

594
00:29:19,289 --> 00:29:20,270
but you keep coming back

595
00:29:20,290 --> 00:29:21,530
because you're invested in the world.

596
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,851
I truly believe for solo development

597
00:29:23,891 --> 00:29:26,313
that is a valid path to aspire to.

598
00:29:26,833 --> 00:29:28,414
And it makes sure that whatever,

599
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:31,175
you know, the gracious exit being

600
00:29:31,215 --> 00:29:32,776
that you're happy where the game.

601
00:29:33,286 --> 00:29:38,331
ended up. You made sure the bugs got fixed. It's your best games. And you know that if

602
00:29:38,371 --> 00:29:42,775
you make something even better in the future, and people go back to play your first game,

603
00:29:43,236 --> 00:29:48,181
it all fits and makes sense. And it's something you're proud of. So yeah, building upward.

604
00:29:48,641 --> 00:29:50,403
So that's my microcontroller.

605
00:29:56,325 --> 00:29:58,408
All right, thank you Thomas.

606
00:29:58,888 --> 00:30:00,771
Well, we have prepared a couple of talking points

607
00:30:00,791 --> 00:30:02,954
that we'll dive in a little deeper

608
00:30:02,994 --> 00:30:05,197
and see what makes you guys tick.

609
00:30:06,195 --> 00:30:08,956
What motivates you, what scares you, what drives you

610
00:30:09,336 --> 00:30:13,517
and what's going solo means for your mental health and your creativity,

611
00:30:13,557 --> 00:30:14,577
your finances.

612
00:30:15,817 --> 00:30:19,178
So let me kick off with a question directed to all four of you.

613
00:30:20,618 --> 00:30:23,418
So when you started your journey as a solo developer,

614
00:30:24,138 --> 00:30:26,559
was there anything that caught you off guard?

615
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:29,699
But you didn't expect.

616
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:32,480
Let's start with Megan.

617
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,220
Yeah, so.

618
00:30:36,524 --> 00:30:39,185
Whenever I made Jones on Fire, whenever I made Skatebird,

619
00:30:39,525 --> 00:30:41,606
what it was supposed to be was a little itty-bitty game

620
00:30:41,626 --> 00:30:42,447
I could manage on my own.

621
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,308
Because previous game I just failed,

622
00:30:44,328 --> 00:30:46,188
I had to let everyone go, it was just me again,

623
00:30:46,429 --> 00:30:47,369
just like Jones on Fire.

624
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:52,892
And then it grew, and I still didn't have a team,

625
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:54,292
it was just me.

626
00:30:54,892 --> 00:30:55,893
So that was fun.

627
00:30:56,013 --> 00:30:58,054
So we had to find, well, I had to find a way

628
00:30:58,094 --> 00:31:01,035
to flex and meet audience interest and expectation.

629
00:31:01,677 --> 00:31:03,759
without undercutting what makes my studio work,

630
00:31:03,799 --> 00:31:05,340
which is I don't have employees

631
00:31:05,400 --> 00:31:07,141
because I don't have the kind of burn rate

632
00:31:07,201 --> 00:31:08,602
or income to make employees work.

633
00:31:09,003 --> 00:31:11,845
So that whole thing, I don't want to scale.

634
00:31:11,905 --> 00:31:14,467
I can't scale without destroying what I am.

635
00:31:15,187 --> 00:31:16,929
So I ended up collaborating with other tiny indies,

636
00:31:17,469 --> 00:31:18,910
other people that are essentially like me.

637
00:31:18,990 --> 00:31:20,972
We kind of Voltron together to make something bigger

638
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:22,453
and then we go our separate ways after.

639
00:31:22,473 --> 00:31:26,156
I found that other people that are our size tend to do that.

640
00:31:26,176 --> 00:31:28,397
It works pretty well, but yeah,

641
00:31:28,417 --> 00:31:29,378
your mileage may vary for me.

642
00:31:29,438 --> 00:31:30,359
That's how I got around it.

643
00:31:30,439 --> 00:31:30,579
But.

644
00:31:31,131 --> 00:31:32,975
It was terrifying at first.

645
00:31:34,498 --> 00:31:34,779
All right.

646
00:31:37,184 --> 00:31:37,365
Neil?

647
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:42,845
Yeah, so I didn't know how depressing it was.

648
00:31:42,945 --> 00:31:47,087
Like Tom had said, I started making the game

649
00:31:47,227 --> 00:31:49,028
and I was really hyped up about it.

650
00:31:49,048 --> 00:31:52,010
Then I got real sad in the middle of making it.

651
00:31:52,050 --> 00:31:54,292
Then I got real excited like towards the end

652
00:31:54,352 --> 00:31:56,533
and then I didn't feel like finishing it,

653
00:31:56,613 --> 00:31:59,115
but I got pressured because people were expecting it.

654
00:31:59,815 --> 00:32:01,636
But when I finished it, it was just like,

655
00:32:02,897 --> 00:32:04,438
Like you said, I didn't feel like doing anything.

656
00:32:04,478 --> 00:32:07,439
I was just like sitting there sad, watching Scandal.

657
00:32:08,499 --> 00:32:09,140
It's a good show.

658
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:13,281
But yeah, I just watched like the whole season of Scandal,

659
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,702
and I was just like depressed.

660
00:32:14,822 --> 00:32:16,883
And I didn't want to look at any of the reviews.

661
00:32:17,823 --> 00:32:19,224
But people were giving me good reviews.

662
00:32:19,264 --> 00:32:20,925
I got like awards and stuff.

663
00:32:21,665 --> 00:32:22,806
But I didn't care about any of it.

664
00:32:23,026 --> 00:32:25,127
And I wasn't expecting not to care about any of it.

665
00:32:25,747 --> 00:32:27,848
I thought I was going to be super excited about everything.

666
00:32:28,068 --> 00:32:35,255
But you know, you know, you finish the game and it's like the thing that like has been you for so long and it's not you anymore.

667
00:32:35,275 --> 00:32:36,536
It's like just out there.

668
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:40,279
And it's like it's pretty depressing.

669
00:32:40,840 --> 00:32:41,721
I wasn't expecting that.

670
00:32:42,902 --> 00:32:44,263
That makes you want to do another game.

671
00:32:45,204 --> 00:32:45,584
It doesn't.

672
00:32:46,185 --> 00:32:46,245
Joe.

673
00:32:51,618 --> 00:32:54,060
Yeah, I mean, I'll echo the emotional roller coaster.

674
00:32:54,100 --> 00:32:57,924
That's definitely a thing that I think I might be one of the people

675
00:32:57,964 --> 00:32:58,925
that Thomas has heard about.

676
00:32:58,945 --> 00:33:05,070
I feel like I'm a fairly stable, emotional person, but this surprised me a lot.

677
00:33:05,171 --> 00:33:09,655
And honestly, I owe Thomas a huge thanks because he was messaging me

678
00:33:10,255 --> 00:33:13,398
on my release, telling all the bad viewers to

679
00:33:13,418 --> 00:33:16,381
to, you know, go away and.

680
00:33:17,423 --> 00:33:24,834
And just, you know, he was walking me through it and it honestly it's a it probably it saved me. I, you know, it was so great. But what the other thing I'll mention is how

681
00:33:27,809 --> 00:33:32,714
like how much stuff is outside of what you think of when you're thinking about making a game.

682
00:33:32,754 --> 00:33:37,038
There's all like the porting is one of those things and talking about hiring people or getting

683
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,903
contracts like there's all these little things you have to be ready for that I didn't you don't

684
00:33:41,943 --> 00:33:45,487
think about when you're just like animating something for fun and all of a sudden it's a

685
00:33:45,527 --> 00:33:48,230
project and you have expectations and so.

686
00:33:49,151 --> 00:33:52,975
being prepared for that sort of stuff once it starts going somewhere is worth it you know

687
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:58,561
having a lawyer all that kind of crazy stuff it's they will save you the stress of the unknown which

688
00:33:58,621 --> 00:34:05,008
is all that sort of stuff all right thomas i think for me the biggest surprise was uh

689
00:34:05,528 --> 00:34:06,389
that i could actually do it

690
00:34:06,592 --> 00:34:08,174
because I'm a very insecure person,

691
00:34:08,274 --> 00:34:09,977
so I always think, I can't do this, I can't do this,

692
00:34:10,077 --> 00:34:11,880
and I'm not a good programmer.

693
00:34:12,280 --> 00:34:15,105
And it turned out, if you do something good enough,

694
00:34:15,225 --> 00:34:17,609
you can actually do it, and you learn, and you get better.

695
00:34:17,749 --> 00:34:19,712
And I do a lot of what's called wall-bashing.

696
00:34:19,832 --> 00:34:22,076
It's just boom, boom, boom, until something works.

697
00:34:23,370 --> 00:34:25,870
And at some point, I said, oh, it's becoming a game.

698
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:27,711
And that's super motivating.

699
00:34:27,911 --> 00:34:31,031
And when you're stuck, you can actually get yourself

700
00:34:31,131 --> 00:34:33,392
out of slump just by, but I'm actually doing it.

701
00:34:33,412 --> 00:34:38,293
And that is, I find that mysterious, and I still do,

702
00:34:38,393 --> 00:34:41,813
that at the end, like I said, when you finish a game,

703
00:34:41,853 --> 00:34:42,814
you need to applaud yourself,

704
00:34:42,974 --> 00:34:46,254
because it's like, you look at it and go, I made this?

705
00:34:46,374 --> 00:34:47,615
Yeah, you have no idea.

706
00:34:47,635 --> 00:34:47,875
It's like.

707
00:34:48,475 --> 00:34:50,835
Really? When did this happen?

708
00:34:51,535 --> 00:34:52,736
Well, three years or something.

709
00:34:52,796 --> 00:34:55,576
Yeah, three years. Like Joe said at some point,

710
00:34:56,317 --> 00:34:58,797
the person that started it isn't the person that's finishing it.

711
00:34:58,917 --> 00:35:02,938
Yeah, that's a big surprise that you can actually do it.

712
00:35:03,778 --> 00:35:05,179
Look at you with the deep comments.

713
00:35:05,339 --> 00:35:07,779
I got to write that one down. That's going on T-shirt.

714
00:35:09,580 --> 00:35:14,621
Yeah. It's fun as well to be a solo developer. We'll get to that.

715
00:35:15,361 --> 00:35:16,802
Absolutely. It absolutely is.

716
00:35:17,473 --> 00:35:21,156
All right, the next question is, I guess, for Joe and Megan.

717
00:35:22,156 --> 00:35:25,139
As a solo developer, you're by definition, you're alone, right?

718
00:35:25,359 --> 00:35:28,982
And so how do you bounce ideas of,

719
00:35:29,362 --> 00:35:32,985
of, you know, how does the creative

720
00:35:33,905 --> 00:35:35,306
feedback loop works for you?

721
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:38,589
So for me, it's a family and friends.

722
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:47,998
Mostly family. I bounce a lot of my partners and if I can't sell them on a game idea and get them to understand what it is and why it's fun, I tend to take that as a big warning sign.

723
00:35:49,198 --> 00:36:01,903
The regular people in your circle tend to become unwitting and possibly unwilling victims for you to inflict your ideas upon and just, hold on, does this sound cool? Okay, but wait, what if I did this? Does that sound cool?

724
00:36:01,923 --> 00:36:06,625
And they're like, okay, okay, I'm going to go to my job now and you're like, okay, this is my job.

725
00:36:08,904 --> 00:36:11,746
Yeah, it gets, but yeah, the kind of them.

726
00:36:12,026 --> 00:36:13,567
And if you've got a local development group,

727
00:36:13,587 --> 00:36:15,849
anything like that, that helps,

728
00:36:16,029 --> 00:36:19,212
but that may not be like, I live in a little tiny town.

729
00:36:19,232 --> 00:36:20,493
There's no game development group here.

730
00:36:20,513 --> 00:36:23,035
So it's kind of just us and yeah.

731
00:36:23,676 --> 00:36:26,198
I like you call them regular people.

732
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:29,761
Joe?

733
00:36:31,374 --> 00:36:44,381
Yeah, I mean, ideally you have a huge group of people to slowly rotate through so you don't burn any of your friends out of like your constant interaction, but for me it really was just a few friends from the industry, mostly animators.

734
00:36:44,921 --> 00:36:54,286
So there's sort of an inherent bias from them they're all developers which will skew their opinion a certain way they're all animators so they're all just judging my animation, and not worrying about if the game is good or not.

735
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:58,768
So they're like with any feedback though you're, you're translating what people are saying right.

736
00:37:01,529 --> 00:37:05,290
and just running ideas through people to see if it sounds good.

737
00:37:05,531 --> 00:37:08,132
I think one of the best tests if an idea is good,

738
00:37:08,572 --> 00:37:11,653
if they like it and then they re-explain it to you,

739
00:37:12,473 --> 00:37:13,874
like what you thought, or if they go,

740
00:37:13,894 --> 00:37:15,694
but what would be also cool would be this,

741
00:37:15,714 --> 00:37:17,535
you go, oh, so you don't really care about this idea,

742
00:37:17,575 --> 00:37:18,996
you're already off to some other thing.

743
00:37:19,516 --> 00:37:22,217
It's this great, are you paying attention and listening

744
00:37:22,277 --> 00:37:24,998
or did I lose your interest even telling you the idea?

745
00:37:26,924 --> 00:37:29,145
And then something that kind of popped up for me late

746
00:37:29,506 --> 00:37:32,187
in production, as far as kind of getting feedback,

747
00:37:32,567 --> 00:37:34,128
was this, and Thomas kind of mentioned it,

748
00:37:34,188 --> 00:37:35,689
that I had said it was like this idea

749
00:37:35,709 --> 00:37:37,450
that there was different people creating this game,

750
00:37:37,470 --> 00:37:38,451
even though it was always me.

751
00:37:38,891 --> 00:37:41,913
And one of them was the designer who came up

752
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:43,574
with all the ideas and built all the systems.

753
00:37:43,914 --> 00:37:46,095
And then late when I was burnt out, I was stressed.

754
00:37:46,155 --> 00:37:48,336
I couldn't, I didn't know if the game was good anymore.

755
00:37:48,817 --> 00:37:52,619
I had to just trust this older version of myself.

756
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:56,244
or this earlier version of myself that thought it was a good idea.

757
00:37:56,264 --> 00:38:00,890
And I just kept building the game, believing that I was right before.

758
00:38:01,050 --> 00:38:03,434
And I just couldn't judge the game anymore.

759
00:38:03,514 --> 00:38:09,602
So I became my own sort of person, I guess, too, in a funny way.

760
00:38:10,478 --> 00:38:11,059
Well, it works.

761
00:38:11,999 --> 00:38:15,540
Thank you.

762
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,641
So this one is for Neil and Thomas.

763
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,062
What's the effect?

764
00:38:19,182 --> 00:38:20,282
We touched upon this a bit.

765
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:22,203
What's the effect of being a solo?

766
00:38:22,723 --> 00:38:23,583
Of being a solo dev?

767
00:38:23,823 --> 00:38:25,164
What's the effect on your mental health?

768
00:38:26,964 --> 00:38:27,084
Neil?

769
00:38:28,308 --> 00:38:30,849
No, no, Thomas goes first. So he can like be a downer.

770
00:38:32,470 --> 00:38:32,830
Everything.

771
00:38:32,850 --> 00:38:41,294
I think I'll try to be cheerful. So it's a huge effect on your

772
00:38:41,314 --> 00:38:45,376
self esteem insecurities. And it does force you to confront all

773
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:48,097
that because there's nobody else to you know, you can't really

774
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:51,078
explain it to other people when you're already on that train

775
00:38:51,138 --> 00:38:51,459
right.

776
00:38:51,479 --> 00:38:52,399
So

777
00:38:54,521 --> 00:38:58,303
It is, you are, you're going to do a lot of growing and learning and stuff.

778
00:38:58,323 --> 00:39:00,685
So it's, it's, it's intense.

779
00:39:00,725 --> 00:39:01,686
I've now done it once.

780
00:39:01,766 --> 00:39:06,149
So, you know, uh, looking forward to the second time, because I, yeah, the

781
00:39:06,489 --> 00:39:11,573
Dev for Cloud, um, CloudPunk, I think it was, he said that thing where you

782
00:39:11,633 --> 00:39:15,436
hate it for three months and then you start to love it again, it took me

783
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:18,798
over six, six months, you know, to re-engage with it.

784
00:39:18,818 --> 00:39:21,580
Uh, but now I, I love it again.

785
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:23,461
And I, I feel it did, you know.

786
00:39:27,876 --> 00:39:30,178
I'm back to enjoying it, I can even look at it again.

787
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,241
So you do grow, you know, and now I'm happier than ever,

788
00:39:35,402 --> 00:39:38,003
because there's great advances, you can be with your kids,

789
00:39:38,043 --> 00:39:39,704
you're at home, all the stuff we forgot.

790
00:39:40,245 --> 00:39:41,606
I'm just making it permanent, you know,

791
00:39:41,626 --> 00:39:43,867
I don't ever want to go to an office again.

792
00:39:44,568 --> 00:39:48,130
So, yeah, it's heavy.

793
00:39:48,771 --> 00:39:51,052
If you get through it, it is great in a sense as well.

794
00:39:51,492 --> 00:39:54,294
But is it a bit of an up and down as well,

795
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:57,795
depending on where you are in the development?

796
00:39:59,536 --> 00:40:03,318
You're now in a situation where you start out with a new game, right?

797
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:07,100
Yeah, definitely. The new game phase is the best.

798
00:40:07,640 --> 00:40:08,680
Everything is hype.

799
00:40:08,740 --> 00:40:12,122
You have to think about, oh, they're epic, you know, just one creative ride.

800
00:40:12,882 --> 00:40:15,324
And it's just, you know, look, the bloody 20 percent.

801
00:40:17,186 --> 00:40:18,668
It's where all the heavy work gets done.

802
00:40:19,148 --> 00:40:25,174
And what Joe said, where you lose the ability to gauge if your own game is shit or not.

803
00:40:26,174 --> 00:40:28,577
And you run around going, it's shit, it's shit, it's shit.

804
00:40:28,857 --> 00:40:30,859
And we about five days ago, it's shit.

805
00:40:30,879 --> 00:40:34,162
And you do something like a giant crap town.

806
00:40:34,262 --> 00:40:34,522
Excellent.

807
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:35,543
Oh, it's epic.

808
00:40:36,063 --> 00:40:36,784
And then it's shit.

809
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:39,226
So it's a roller coaster.

810
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:39,447
Yeah.

811
00:40:40,287 --> 00:40:41,609
All right.

812
00:40:41,669 --> 00:40:41,989
So Neil.

813
00:40:43,265 --> 00:40:47,666
Yeah, we keep saying that it's depressing.

814
00:40:47,766 --> 00:40:49,226
I think everybody gets to that point.

815
00:40:50,326 --> 00:40:55,447
But what made me feel better, because like Thomas said,

816
00:40:55,567 --> 00:40:57,688
after my game came out, I was just real sad.

817
00:40:57,708 --> 00:41:00,228
And I couldn't even look at it.

818
00:41:00,248 --> 00:41:02,509
I was like, it is what it is.

819
00:41:02,749 --> 00:41:03,149
It's done.

820
00:41:03,949 --> 00:41:06,229
My name's on it for all the reasons Thomas said.

821
00:41:06,249 --> 00:41:06,990
I put my name on it.

822
00:41:07,710 --> 00:41:11,374
and I just was I just kind of washed my hands of it. I was like maybe I'll look at it later.

823
00:41:11,394 --> 00:41:15,159
A couple weeks later I started going on Twitch and just watching people play

824
00:41:15,579 --> 00:41:17,902
and watching how excited people were about it.

825
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:20,461
And it got me back into it.

826
00:41:20,501 --> 00:41:21,902
I was like, well, maybe this is good.

827
00:41:22,022 --> 00:41:23,703
Maybe I did do something here.

828
00:41:23,723 --> 00:41:27,005
And then I got an email from like this mom

829
00:41:27,065 --> 00:41:29,386
who was like, my kid been playing your game.

830
00:41:29,406 --> 00:41:31,747
And then he found out that you look like him.

831
00:41:32,187 --> 00:41:33,288
And he was so excited.

832
00:41:33,328 --> 00:41:34,889
And I hopped on a call with the kid

833
00:41:34,969 --> 00:41:37,450
and he was like super excited and stuff like that.

834
00:41:37,470 --> 00:41:39,951
And he said he wanted to start making games.

835
00:41:39,991 --> 00:41:41,552
And I followed him on itch.

836
00:41:41,592 --> 00:41:43,473
And I was like, I can't wait for you to make a game.

837
00:41:43,513 --> 00:41:44,954
I'm gonna be the first one to play it.

838
00:41:45,394 --> 00:41:49,357
And it was like really inspirational and I like, oh man, I kind of want to make a game now.

839
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,780
That's awesome.

840
00:41:55,060 --> 00:42:00,964
Nice. So this next one is for, I guess, for Megan and Joe. So how do you handle the internal

841
00:42:01,004 --> 00:42:05,427
discussion between your inner producer, the one who wants to do everything on time,

842
00:42:06,148 --> 00:42:11,251
and the inner designer who wants to keep working on it and make it better and better? So how do you

843
00:42:12,011 --> 00:42:13,532
handle this?

844
00:42:14,613 --> 00:42:15,033
Well, Megan.

845
00:42:16,378 --> 00:42:20,160
Okay, so I'm one of the weird ones that likes organization.

846
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:22,921
I use toggle to time box tasks.

847
00:42:23,241 --> 00:42:24,822
And often I'll pre-plan a day with like,

848
00:42:24,862 --> 00:42:25,922
I need to do this, this, and this,

849
00:42:25,942 --> 00:42:26,883
they each get their own tasks.

850
00:42:26,943 --> 00:42:28,623
So that at any given time I can look on there and go,

851
00:42:28,703 --> 00:42:30,064
okay, this one is what you're working on.

852
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:32,365
And this is what comes next and so on and so forth.

853
00:42:33,025 --> 00:42:36,067
I also use Trello to list out all the things

854
00:42:36,087 --> 00:42:38,008
that I think I'm going to need at the start of the game.

855
00:42:38,108 --> 00:42:40,569
So that at any given time I can look at this and go,

856
00:42:41,369 --> 00:42:44,150
it's about maybe a couple of years or something left.

857
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,111
And I can see it shrink.

858
00:42:45,716 --> 00:42:48,037
And when I get to the last six months, I can go, okay,

859
00:42:48,598 --> 00:42:50,159
this isn't important and this isn't important.

860
00:42:50,179 --> 00:42:51,239
I know that's a terrible idea.

861
00:42:51,279 --> 00:42:53,561
And I can kind of shrink the list down to something

862
00:42:53,601 --> 00:42:55,422
that maybe is doable by our launch day.

863
00:42:55,942 --> 00:42:57,263
And then of course we delay twice

864
00:42:57,443 --> 00:42:59,404
because it doesn't matter, but still,

865
00:42:59,465 --> 00:43:01,426
at least I'm within like six months to a year

866
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:03,567
instead of three or four years over.

867
00:43:03,587 --> 00:43:08,290
I'm one of the designers that, I like limitations.

868
00:43:08,610 --> 00:43:09,991
I like painting within the lines.

869
00:43:10,071 --> 00:43:12,473
I also like drawing the lines, but I'm more creative

870
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:14,594
if I start by drawing the outline of, okay,

871
00:43:14,614 --> 00:43:14,814
this is.

872
00:43:15,304 --> 00:43:19,689
roughly the shape, and then I figure out how to work within that space. That's how I work.

873
00:43:20,290 --> 00:43:24,395
I don't know about others, though. Well, you're actually your own producer there.

874
00:43:25,356 --> 00:43:28,079
Yeah. Joe?

875
00:43:29,296 --> 00:43:34,599
I don't think that we could be much different probably from our methods. I very much, and I

876
00:43:34,639 --> 00:43:39,722
kind of talk about it in my thing, I'm very much a work on what feels the most important at the

877
00:43:39,742 --> 00:43:46,567
moment type of a person. I do not have a schedule. I've loaded Trello like three times and then

878
00:43:46,587 --> 00:43:52,790
forgot I put anything in it kind of thing. But for me, it's a much more fluid and it's much more

879
00:43:52,890 --> 00:43:54,071
fast-paced work.

880
00:43:54,852 --> 00:44:00,898
style to work on what I'm the most interested in. I think when passion's involved, work is always

881
00:44:00,998 --> 00:44:08,506
done quicker and more on target. I think what helped me be like that is setting those really

882
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:13,731
strict limits on myself early on. I had a really clean picture of the scope of the game. So I

883
00:44:14,572 --> 00:44:20,676
I was good at never trying to add anything that would distract and would kind of outscale myself.

884
00:44:20,816 --> 00:44:27,080
But once I got in that box, I just sort of did whatever was feeling right. I would track some

885
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:31,964
stuff once in a while. I would be like, I'm doing a lighting pass on the entire game. I got through

886
00:44:32,324 --> 00:44:36,847
a third of it. It took me this long. I'll just multiply it and I'll guess that it'll take me

887
00:44:36,887 --> 00:44:42,070
another week or whatever it might be. And then I would extrapolate that a few times and be like,

888
00:44:42,090 --> 00:44:43,271
I should be able to be done by lunch.

889
00:44:45,205 --> 00:44:48,708
And that's, I mean, it sounds so crazy, but it's, it's, it's really just a, uh,

890
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:51,511
uh, an excitement and a passion fuel development for me.

891
00:44:51,531 --> 00:44:54,574
And I, I always love working like that with animation, with whatever it is.

892
00:44:54,634 --> 00:44:57,037
And I feel like I work better that way.

893
00:44:57,797 --> 00:44:57,998
All right.

894
00:44:58,018 --> 00:45:01,521
But the best is when you learn something new and then you're like, Oh, I can add

895
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,443
this to my game and you just throw it in your whole game.

896
00:45:04,111 --> 00:45:06,652
No, you can't do it. Resist, resist.

897
00:45:06,892 --> 00:45:08,212
But it's so fun.

898
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:10,293
I know. Save it for the next one.

899
00:45:10,313 --> 00:45:11,573
I do have a huge notes of like,

900
00:45:11,853 --> 00:45:14,714
when I have more time in the next project thing.

901
00:45:15,274 --> 00:45:18,135
And that helps because my game is supposed to be a trilogy.

902
00:45:18,195 --> 00:45:21,056
So it was really easy, which maybe helped to go,

903
00:45:21,096 --> 00:45:22,917
this can be in part two or something, you know,

904
00:45:23,217 --> 00:45:24,577
like it would still work,

905
00:45:24,597 --> 00:45:26,358
but I'll just save it for the next part.

906
00:45:27,305 --> 00:45:29,689
But you did set a sort of release date, right?

907
00:45:29,829 --> 00:45:31,692
Or you had a schedule to...

908
00:45:32,173 --> 00:45:36,179
Did you make your release date or?

909
00:45:37,257 --> 00:45:38,257
No, I delayed.

910
00:45:38,397 --> 00:45:41,358
I had like a tentative spring of last year

911
00:45:41,378 --> 00:45:44,798
that got pushed out when I knew a little bit more

912
00:45:44,838 --> 00:45:47,039
about how the true pace of the game was going.

913
00:45:47,539 --> 00:45:49,659
And then I delayed like one more time by a month.

914
00:45:49,719 --> 00:45:52,100
It was just like, I'm just gonna be coming in

915
00:45:52,600 --> 00:45:53,600
way too screaming hot.

916
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,801
And so before I announced, I pushed it like one more month.

917
00:45:57,241 --> 00:45:57,901
All right, okay.

918
00:45:58,321 --> 00:45:59,061
So it wasn't that bad.

919
00:45:59,101 --> 00:46:02,342
The whole development was like two years and a few months.

920
00:46:02,382 --> 00:46:05,623
So indie side things, that's pretty fast I think.

921
00:46:06,795 --> 00:46:09,698
All right. So this one is for Neil and Thomas.

922
00:46:11,320 --> 00:46:14,723
How do you manage the combination of having complete creative freedom

923
00:46:15,664 --> 00:46:20,770
on the one hand and your own limitations as a developer on the other hand?

924
00:46:22,011 --> 00:46:24,533
How do you manage them? I'm looking at you, Thomas.

925
00:46:26,274 --> 00:46:32,818
So I am not Megan, I can't do lists and I can't do limitations.

926
00:46:33,038 --> 00:46:35,720
I made a game about wanting to be free and that's a struggle.

927
00:46:35,740 --> 00:46:43,104
So I found this way to get myself to perhaps just by allowing myself to faff off

928
00:46:43,264 --> 00:46:46,566
and I learned that's a new word, it's a proper word.

929
00:46:48,247 --> 00:46:50,909
And intellectually pursue whatever I want to pursue.

930
00:46:51,449 --> 00:46:51,949
I just allow...

931
00:46:52,712 --> 00:46:56,455
Just like I think the theme is there's limitations are important.

932
00:46:56,475 --> 00:46:57,355
So I have limitations.

933
00:46:57,715 --> 00:46:58,956
I use no textures or whatever.

934
00:46:59,657 --> 00:47:03,139
And then allow myself within those rules to do whatever they want.

935
00:47:03,579 --> 00:47:04,680
You know, I need to wake up.

936
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:08,282
I literally, it's something running in my mind.

937
00:47:08,302 --> 00:47:09,683
I'll go to bed and I wake up.

938
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:10,834
I gotta do this.

939
00:47:11,194 --> 00:47:11,975
And then I have to do it,

940
00:47:12,135 --> 00:47:13,375
because that's what I enjoy.

941
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:14,556
I gotta go do it.

942
00:47:14,956 --> 00:47:17,717
So if that means, look, if this is possible,

943
00:47:17,837 --> 00:47:19,618
or I've connected, you know, at some point,

944
00:47:20,198 --> 00:47:22,039
someone on Discord said, you know,

945
00:47:22,199 --> 00:47:24,800
why don't the ships and the guns have spotlights

946
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,040
or floodlights or whatever?

947
00:47:27,861 --> 00:47:28,581
I'll just sit there and go.

948
00:47:31,963 --> 00:47:32,544
Gotta do it.

949
00:47:33,384 --> 00:47:36,064
And I'll allow myself just to take the day and do it

950
00:47:36,344 --> 00:47:37,625
because it's enjoyable.

951
00:47:37,765 --> 00:47:40,685
And you're a frail, creative person.

952
00:47:41,086 --> 00:47:43,806
You need to go out, you need that acknowledgement

953
00:47:43,846 --> 00:47:45,066
that I can make something cool,

954
00:47:45,166 --> 00:47:46,987
even when you're stuck in making systems.

955
00:47:47,567 --> 00:47:49,787
And those are the worst things for me.

956
00:47:49,827 --> 00:47:51,728
So I went to my partner and said,

957
00:47:51,748 --> 00:47:55,489
okay, the next three to six months, I am baking systems.

958
00:47:55,889 --> 00:47:56,829
I'm going to be angry.

959
00:47:57,367 --> 00:48:02,193
I am going to be sad, I am going to be frustrated, it's really hard, but I got to do it.

960
00:48:03,174 --> 00:48:05,778
So, you know, you got to breath and get through that.

961
00:48:06,559 --> 00:48:10,984
But I also do that, but even then, it's like, okay, now make a crazy cool town because that's,

962
00:48:11,105 --> 00:48:13,448
you know, I'm down, got to make something cool.

963
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:18,950
And that's, you know, sometimes you gotta let yourself go and try to be free.

964
00:48:18,990 --> 00:48:21,110
And then afterwards, it's a damage control.

965
00:48:21,150 --> 00:48:24,611
Just look, people ask, why is the falcon here so big?

966
00:48:24,631 --> 00:48:25,091
Why is there so much?

967
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:25,931
It's just me.

968
00:48:26,031 --> 00:48:29,232
I got to make something and then afterwards, okay, I got to give it a space in the world.

969
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:31,432
And okay, so there's another cool place.

970
00:48:31,772 --> 00:48:32,152
Nice.

971
00:48:32,433 --> 00:48:33,273
I don't know what to do with it.

972
00:48:34,253 --> 00:48:36,273
Uh, but that, that's how stuff grows for me.

973
00:48:36,574 --> 00:48:39,395
Yeah, it doesn't feel like limitations at all, right?

974
00:48:41,516 --> 00:48:45,198
I could be very harsh for it, but it's usually very unlimited.

975
00:48:46,278 --> 00:48:47,219
What about you, Neil?

976
00:48:48,279 --> 00:48:56,143
Yeah, same with me. No list, no list over here. I kind of just time, I box myself in the levels.

977
00:48:56,643 --> 00:48:59,625
I kind of, you know, after I started the game, I figured out how many,

978
00:48:59,865 --> 00:49:01,766
how much time is it going to take me to make a level.

979
00:49:03,624 --> 00:49:07,327
And then I kind of based that off of like how much time until I want the game to come out

980
00:49:07,648 --> 00:49:11,731
and then with, you know, adjustments, but I will pretty much just have an idea.

981
00:49:11,751 --> 00:49:15,455
And I was like, well, whatever I was going to do, I need to do this now,

982
00:49:15,595 --> 00:49:16,796
because this is all I'm thinking about.

983
00:49:18,717 --> 00:49:20,358
And that's kind of how the update,

984
00:49:20,738 --> 00:49:22,739
I had this giant free update that came out.

985
00:49:22,999 --> 00:49:24,119
That's kind of how that came about.

986
00:49:24,799 --> 00:49:26,440
People didn't like the ending.

987
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:29,741
So I was like, well, this is gonna bug me forever.

988
00:49:30,801 --> 00:49:34,102
So I spent like three months making a whole new ending

989
00:49:34,402 --> 00:49:36,803
to the game and changing the story

990
00:49:36,883 --> 00:49:39,004
and doing a bunch of new cut scenes and stuff like that

991
00:49:39,284 --> 00:49:40,344
because it's all I could think about

992
00:49:40,424 --> 00:49:41,644
and nothing else mattered.

993
00:49:42,145 --> 00:49:44,225
I knew, you kind of want to...

994
00:49:45,188 --> 00:49:47,349
you know, want to have a happy ending with your game.

995
00:49:48,009 --> 00:49:50,030
I can use better phrasing than that.

996
00:49:50,750 --> 00:49:53,651
You want to you want to have a good conclusion

997
00:49:54,051 --> 00:49:55,972
as far as the story of how you made your game.

998
00:49:57,532 --> 00:50:01,233
And I really wanted it to be like, you know, I saw the flaws.

999
00:50:01,293 --> 00:50:04,614
I heard the feedback and I made adjustments

1000
00:50:05,494 --> 00:50:08,135
that made me happy and people who played my game happy.

1001
00:50:08,935 --> 00:50:13,137
So the fact that the the game ending the first time wasn't.

1002
00:50:15,363 --> 00:50:22,385
good enough? It wasn't good, it was trash. But was that because of your limitation as a developer at

1003
00:50:22,425 --> 00:50:22,806
that point?

1004
00:50:23,585 --> 00:50:27,468
Yeah, I ran out of time. And my original ending, I was like, Oh,

1005
00:50:27,508 --> 00:50:31,250
I'm gonna be all, you know, artistic and mysterious, and

1006
00:50:31,550 --> 00:50:34,953
whatever. And I show people the ending. I showed my friend Dan

1007
00:50:34,993 --> 00:50:39,315
who did all the music. And he was like, Yeah, you could do

1008
00:50:39,335 --> 00:50:42,357
that if you want to. And I changed the ending, like eight

1009
00:50:42,437 --> 00:50:46,059
times. And I kept showing it to people. And the last, the last

1010
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,140
ending before the update.

1011
00:50:47,841 --> 00:50:50,323
I was like, you know, I ain't got enough time to change it again.

1012
00:50:50,363 --> 00:50:53,486
I don't care if y'all like it. I think somebody out there will like it.

1013
00:50:53,946 --> 00:50:54,507
And I was wrong.

1014
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:58,370
But I think, you know, it's all for the best.

1015
00:50:58,770 --> 00:51:00,272
Nothing wrong to admit that.

1016
00:51:01,052 --> 00:51:04,896
So guys, we're kind of running out of time, I think.

1017
00:51:05,056 --> 00:51:08,239
So to wrap this up, a final question directed to all of you.

1018
00:51:09,740 --> 00:51:12,983
Taking everything what we heard today...

1019
00:51:15,125 --> 00:51:17,827
Do you still want to continue as a solo developer?

1020
00:51:19,187 --> 00:51:19,508
Megan?

1021
00:51:20,989 --> 00:51:21,769
Yeah, hell yeah.

1022
00:51:22,490 --> 00:51:24,851
I really like working.

1023
00:51:25,972 --> 00:51:29,934
Working as a solo developer, working as a small micro whatever,

1024
00:51:30,735 --> 00:51:34,657
means that I can survive off a very, very small success,

1025
00:51:34,978 --> 00:51:36,479
which means that I keep doing this forever.

1026
00:51:36,559 --> 00:51:39,180
Hopefully, at least the bar is lower to keep surviving.

1027
00:51:39,652 --> 00:51:40,772
And I can work on weirder stuff.

1028
00:51:41,052 --> 00:51:43,873
Like if I was working on a 10 person,

1029
00:51:44,613 --> 00:51:45,873
about a hundred thousand dollars a head,

1030
00:51:45,933 --> 00:51:47,694
million dollars a year kind of studio,

1031
00:51:48,394 --> 00:51:50,294
there's only so many game concepts you can make

1032
00:51:50,394 --> 00:51:53,895
that have a million dollar a year revenue

1033
00:51:53,955 --> 00:51:54,996
that keep you alive.

1034
00:51:55,416 --> 00:51:57,256
Or you got to score a bunch of publisher deals

1035
00:51:57,316 --> 00:51:58,076
and then they're going to tell you,

1036
00:51:58,116 --> 00:51:59,477
oh, you can't put a bird on the skateboard

1037
00:51:59,537 --> 00:52:00,777
because that's dumb.

1038
00:52:01,017 --> 00:52:04,078
And well, I like dumb stuff.

1039
00:52:04,158 --> 00:52:05,338
So I'm going to keep making dumb stuff.

1040
00:52:05,818 --> 00:52:06,999
So yeah, definitely.

1041
00:52:07,439 --> 00:52:08,539
All right, Neil.

1042
00:52:11,687 --> 00:52:16,096
No, I go back and forth every day with it.

1043
00:52:16,116 --> 00:52:19,022
I don't really think any development is worth it

1044
00:52:19,063 --> 00:52:21,388
unless it's a hobby, just because the...

1045
00:52:22,929 --> 00:52:24,510
The money isn't what people think it is.

1046
00:52:25,471 --> 00:52:28,555
There's a lot of hidden costs, a lot of tax costs

1047
00:52:28,575 --> 00:52:29,896
that you don't consider.

1048
00:52:29,916 --> 00:52:33,340
I think I'm still going to make some stuff,

1049
00:52:33,821 --> 00:52:35,162
but I definitely have a cap.

1050
00:52:35,863 --> 00:52:38,586
I think by the time I turn a certain age,

1051
00:52:38,666 --> 00:52:40,108
and I don't know, pick a random number,

1052
00:52:40,909 --> 00:52:42,871
I'm going to say I'm retiring from this

1053
00:52:42,891 --> 00:52:44,012
or I'm kind of done with this.

1054
00:52:44,793 --> 00:52:47,234
And it's not good for your mental health.

1055
00:52:47,714 --> 00:52:49,635
I need some kind of team or something like that

1056
00:52:50,015 --> 00:52:51,036
to take some of the stress

1057
00:52:51,096 --> 00:52:53,597
and some of the responsibilities off of me.

1058
00:52:54,217 --> 00:52:54,998
But as me personally,

1059
00:52:55,018 --> 00:52:57,679
I think everybody got their own kind of thing with that.

1060
00:52:57,979 --> 00:52:58,800
Sure, yeah.

1061
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,261
Okay, Joe.

1062
00:53:02,575 --> 00:53:03,516
Yeah, absolutely.

1063
00:53:03,536 --> 00:53:06,797
I think part of the learning process

1064
00:53:06,857 --> 00:53:09,639
was learning about the emotional sort of rollercoaster.

1065
00:53:09,659 --> 00:53:11,380
And that's why a lot of us are talking about it

1066
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:13,221
because it was a big surprise

1067
00:53:13,281 --> 00:53:15,642
and it's sort of one of the realities of solo development.

1068
00:53:16,762 --> 00:53:20,504
But that's not to outshine the, you know,

1069
00:53:20,944 --> 00:53:24,406
24 months of total enjoyment I had building the game,

1070
00:53:24,586 --> 00:53:26,147
learning new stuff all the time.

1071
00:53:26,707 --> 00:53:29,068
Me and some of my other solo dev friends

1072
00:53:29,268 --> 00:53:31,329
talk about how this is the game we're playing now

1073
00:53:31,409 --> 00:53:31,730
instead of.

1074
00:53:32,427 --> 00:53:33,728
playing Call of Duty all night together.

1075
00:53:33,768 --> 00:53:36,089
We're all sort of on Discord while we work on our games

1076
00:53:36,169 --> 00:53:38,030
and there's, I've been playing games forever

1077
00:53:38,290 --> 00:53:41,812
and now I'm making them for the same enjoyment factor.

1078
00:53:42,433 --> 00:53:46,175
And I don't, unless I have to stop, I don't plan on it.

1079
00:53:46,795 --> 00:53:47,575
All right, then don't.

1080
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:48,936
Thomas.

1081
00:53:49,836 --> 00:53:50,897
I'm never gonna stop this.

1082
00:53:52,058 --> 00:53:54,479
I recently started, yeah, I took a long break,

1083
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:55,760
you know, six months, which is,

1084
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:58,241
and I got depressed from not doing anything.

1085
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:02,942
And I started up again and then people talk mojo and whatever.

1086
00:54:04,103 --> 00:54:06,204
Can I do something again? Can I be creative?

1087
00:54:06,264 --> 00:54:09,826
I started making something and it all came flowing back

1088
00:54:09,966 --> 00:54:11,466
and it was faster than ever, you know,

1089
00:54:11,507 --> 00:54:13,788
it's just like a city builder and it's exciting

1090
00:54:13,808 --> 00:54:17,810
and it's all that buzz and I want that, you know,

1091
00:54:17,910 --> 00:54:20,491
and then preferably without the stress and mental health issues.

1092
00:54:21,632 --> 00:54:25,294
But that, you know, that is the core of my life, just making that.

1093
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:29,564
And I love people. I love having people around me. I love working with people.

1094
00:54:29,804 --> 00:54:35,430
I'm just not super organized and, you know, kitted out to be a super good team member.

1095
00:54:36,711 --> 00:54:41,195
But I love that, you know, you get a publisher, you know, during Corona, that's a bit tough.

1096
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,837
But, you know, why would you take a publisher?

1097
00:54:44,563 --> 00:54:45,804
So you have someone to talk to.

1098
00:54:47,204 --> 00:54:48,105
For me, that helps.

1099
00:54:49,505 --> 00:54:51,125
So yeah, I'm definitely going to do it again.

1100
00:54:51,546 --> 00:54:53,186
I enjoy it a lot.

1101
00:54:53,606 --> 00:54:53,786
Cool.

1102
00:54:55,487 --> 00:54:59,148
I think we have time for one or two questions from the audience.

1103
00:54:59,968 --> 00:55:00,208
Do we?

1104
00:55:00,428 --> 00:55:01,568
Yeah?

1105
00:55:02,349 --> 00:55:05,670
If you have a question, could you please walk onto the microphone

1106
00:55:05,750 --> 00:55:06,970
and speak into the microphone?

1107
00:55:07,010 --> 00:55:07,770
I think you were first.

1108
00:55:08,314 --> 00:55:10,136
Yeah, sorry, I was really excited when you said that

1109
00:55:10,196 --> 00:55:11,677
for the first time.

1110
00:55:12,217 --> 00:55:15,780
So one of the things for me is, as a solo developer,

1111
00:55:15,860 --> 00:55:19,403
I kind of fell into leading my own project

1112
00:55:19,443 --> 00:55:20,244
and everything like that.

1113
00:55:20,284 --> 00:55:22,005
At first, it just started as a passion project.

1114
00:55:23,086 --> 00:55:26,809
As mentioned earlier, the whole idea of doing it all on your

1115
00:55:26,849 --> 00:55:28,391
own is that it's an idea.

1116
00:55:28,551 --> 00:55:31,093
Usually behind the scenes, there is a small team or people

1117
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:32,274
that you're getting help from.

1118
00:55:33,054 --> 00:55:35,957
So my question is, for the indie side of things,

1119
00:55:35,977 --> 00:55:37,418
when you know you're completely on your own.

1120
00:55:38,899 --> 00:55:48,483
Do you have any advice or personal experience in terms of making sure that the people you help are properly compensated, especially when it's coming out of your own pocket?

1121
00:55:48,883 --> 00:55:52,945
Slash, is there a way to get funding for your individual game?

1122
00:55:54,700 --> 00:55:57,442
Yeah, there's a lot of different ways to get funding.

1123
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:00,724
You know, there's a bunch of funds out there

1124
00:56:00,744 --> 00:56:02,065
that you can kind of apply for

1125
00:56:02,085 --> 00:56:04,207
and get just a little bit of money.

1126
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:07,229
But as far as like getting people to help you

1127
00:56:07,249 --> 00:56:09,891
and paying them, I had a rule that like anybody

1128
00:56:09,931 --> 00:56:12,653
who touched my game outside of me was gonna get paid.

1129
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,796
I would ask them and say, hey, this is what I need.

1130
00:56:17,616 --> 00:56:20,518
If their price was too high or like not too high,

1131
00:56:20,818 --> 00:56:23,020
but something that I couldn't like afford on my budget,

1132
00:56:23,460 --> 00:56:25,081
I would just say, you know, thank you.

1133
00:56:25,101 --> 00:56:26,462
You know, you're awesome.

1134
00:56:26,583 --> 00:56:28,804
I just can't afford it with the money that I'm working with.

1135
00:56:28,824 --> 00:56:31,226
So I would either save up some more money

1136
00:56:31,286 --> 00:56:32,827
to try to kind of meet that cost

1137
00:56:32,927 --> 00:56:35,329
or kind of find someone within my budget.

1138
00:56:37,130 --> 00:56:40,012
If I can add to that, I always say everybody I meet,

1139
00:56:42,452 --> 00:56:45,493
I started it while I still was working, doing it in the evenings.

1140
00:56:47,113 --> 00:56:48,474
This is a high-risk business.

1141
00:56:49,174 --> 00:56:52,775
Do not borrow money, boot up your house or do anything.

1142
00:56:53,095 --> 00:56:54,455
This is your mental health as well.

1143
00:56:55,175 --> 00:56:57,976
One of the stresses I had at the end is, we're running out of money.

1144
00:56:58,016 --> 00:56:59,596
I've got three kids, I've got a mortgage.

1145
00:57:01,017 --> 00:57:03,397
Luckily, I had a publisher step in and help me out there.

1146
00:57:04,133 --> 00:57:06,474
Be careful with what you do and be careful with the people

1147
00:57:06,494 --> 00:57:08,635
you're around, with what you commit to.

1148
00:57:09,615 --> 00:57:11,496
If you don't have the money for other people to help you,

1149
00:57:11,836 --> 00:57:13,436
don't do it.

1150
00:57:13,456 --> 00:57:15,377
And when you have people working for you,

1151
00:57:16,497 --> 00:57:19,218
allow them to be creatively free so that you respect their

1152
00:57:19,498 --> 00:57:21,078
progress, their input.

1153
00:57:21,398 --> 00:57:23,999
And if you can't do that, I have problems with that, then

1154
00:57:26,060 --> 00:57:28,180
don't do that because you're not going to be a good

1155
00:57:29,721 --> 00:57:30,601
employer or whatever.

1156
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:37,703
And the other thing is, you know, there are lots of ways to get money down.

1157
00:57:38,003 --> 00:57:41,304
And I hear people do rev share. It's good.

1158
00:57:41,684 --> 00:57:45,865
But make sure you pay people and that people don't work for free ever.

1159
00:57:45,925 --> 00:57:48,045
I have to cut you short. Thank you.

1160
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:50,165
Because we only we were running out of time.

1161
00:57:50,185 --> 00:57:53,206
So I'm trying to get as many questions as we can in the couple of minutes

1162
00:57:53,226 --> 00:57:54,966
we have left. Please.

1163
00:57:55,586 --> 00:57:59,907
So I'm working on my first solo game and I'm actually making a tabletop RPG.

1164
00:58:01,261 --> 00:58:09,324
I was wondering if any of you have experience with the tabletop side of things, because I know, you know, from the talk, it's a lot different than making a computer game.

1165
00:58:09,624 --> 00:58:18,707
And if you could, if you do have experience, what can I carry over from the talk when it comes to looking to publish my first tabletop game?

1166
00:58:19,607 --> 00:58:23,228
All right, I'm looking at the panelists. Any tabletoppers around?

1167
00:58:24,446 --> 00:58:24,947
Joe?

1168
00:58:25,287 --> 00:58:26,969
I don't have a tabletop experience,

1169
00:58:27,109 --> 00:58:29,311
but I, and if somebody else does, please jump in.

1170
00:58:29,331 --> 00:58:31,994
But I think almost all of it's gonna carry over

1171
00:58:32,014 --> 00:58:33,956
to some degree in a lot of ways.

1172
00:58:35,057 --> 00:58:37,620
Some of this stuff is core, just business practices,

1173
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:39,863
like getting yourself out there as early as you can,

1174
00:58:40,463 --> 00:58:41,565
having fun the whole time,

1175
00:58:41,785 --> 00:58:44,047
understanding like what it truly takes

1176
00:58:44,107 --> 00:58:45,609
to make a tabletop game, not just...

1177
00:58:46,548 --> 00:58:49,749
designing it and creating the pieces, but like what does it mean to distribute that? Because

1178
00:58:49,769 --> 00:58:53,551
that would be something that's pretty different for us, where we probably are all digital only,

1179
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:58,753
I'm guessing. I know Thomas did a little printing, but I think for the most part,

1180
00:58:58,813 --> 00:59:03,255
it's all, it all is pretty relevant, except for the delivering of the product.

1181
00:59:04,276 --> 00:59:08,098
Which is where you really run into problems. I've had a couple of friends that have done

1182
00:59:08,218 --> 00:59:11,039
board get, like me personally, I've never done it, but I have a couple of friends that do this.

1183
00:59:11,624 --> 00:59:16,166
The gist is you need to be in a position where you can spend years playtesting,

1184
00:59:16,386 --> 00:59:20,147
because it will take you that long to slowly figure out what works with a game and what doesn't.

1185
00:59:20,827 --> 00:59:23,868
So you're probably going to want to develop a close group of friends that you can do this with.

1186
00:59:23,888 --> 00:59:28,290
You can either be online with one of the tabletop simulators or in person. I've seen both work.

1187
00:59:29,210 --> 00:59:33,091
The really hard part though is the publisher, because there's this massive bar between

1188
00:59:33,171 --> 00:59:36,892
I'm going to sell my own game and I'm going to get a publishing deal.

1189
00:59:37,112 --> 00:59:39,993
Getting a publishing deal is super hard, almost no one scores them.

1190
00:59:41,217 --> 00:59:43,359
Be prepared for that not to happen.

1191
00:59:43,539 --> 00:59:45,722
So again, like Thomas said,

1192
00:59:45,862 --> 00:59:47,524
don't risk your own money towards this.

1193
00:59:48,045 --> 00:59:48,906
Keep it very cheap.

1194
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:51,609
Try to keep it as an evening's thing

1195
00:59:51,769 --> 00:59:54,592
until you have a game that is like there.

1196
00:59:55,193 --> 00:59:56,635
And then try to go to the publisher

1197
00:59:56,735 --> 00:59:58,637
and it may not work out.

1198
00:59:58,657 --> 00:59:59,759
But that doesn't mean don't try,

1199
00:59:59,819 --> 01:00:01,661
just go in with eyes open.

1200
01:00:02,692 --> 01:00:03,272
Thank you very much.

1201
01:00:03,312 --> 01:00:03,713
Thank you.

1202
01:00:04,213 --> 01:00:05,453
Final question, I'm afraid.

1203
01:00:06,073 --> 01:00:10,095
After this, we'll, in the breakout room, you can talk to Telmus if you want.

1204
01:00:10,615 --> 01:00:11,455
Final question, yes.

1205
01:00:11,896 --> 01:00:16,437
Hi, question about narrative design and sort of designing the mechanics of your game.

1206
01:00:16,657 --> 01:00:20,399
When do the mechanics inform the narrative you're trying to present and where does the

1207
01:00:20,459 --> 01:00:22,600
narrative inform the design that you're presenting?

1208
01:00:28,293 --> 01:00:29,254
Go ahead.

1209
01:00:29,594 --> 01:00:33,097
I think that the thing with those kinds of questions, they're different for everybody.

1210
01:00:33,457 --> 01:00:35,639
And you're by yourself, you get to decide.

1211
01:00:36,460 --> 01:00:41,524
I've heard many good talks on narrative mechanics, conflicts at GDC before.

1212
01:00:43,565 --> 01:00:46,848
But yeah, there is no right answer to me, you know.

1213
01:00:47,268 --> 01:00:48,810
It is what you want to do. Be the artist.

1214
01:00:48,970 --> 01:00:50,691
It's a story-driven game, a mechanical game.

1215
01:00:51,132 --> 01:00:51,752
They all fight.

1216
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:55,751
Yeah, that's pretty much what I was going to say.

1217
01:00:56,371 --> 01:00:59,772
All right, so I'm afraid we have come to an end to this panel.

1218
01:00:59,832 --> 01:01:04,374
I would like to thank Megan Fox, Joe Winter, Neil Jones,

1219
01:01:04,434 --> 01:01:05,674
and Thomas Sala.

1220
01:01:06,434 --> 01:01:06,814
For...

1221
01:01:11,255 --> 01:01:13,256
Thomas will be around afterwards to answer

1222
01:01:13,336 --> 01:01:14,416
any additional questions.

1223
01:01:14,896 --> 01:01:17,077
Please fill in the evaluation form.

1224
01:01:17,797 --> 01:01:20,618
Thanks again, and enjoy the rest of GDC.

1225
01:01:20,938 --> 01:01:21,358
Thanks, guys.

1226
01:01:21,378 --> 01:01:21,898
Thanks, everybody.
