1
00:00:06,496 --> 00:00:16,633
Hello. I'm Holly. This is a window. It's not a very good window. We'll come back to the window in a few minutes.

2
00:00:18,222 --> 00:00:21,983
So I'm Holly, I'm half of a tiny company called Mathis & Marco,

3
00:00:22,003 --> 00:00:27,664
and we make games that usually have some sort of physical existence in the world,

4
00:00:28,144 --> 00:00:32,065
and usually have some sort of invitation to player creativity.

5
00:00:32,865 --> 00:00:36,666
So we do things like this, which is a game called One Easy Step,

6
00:00:36,786 --> 00:00:39,847
which happened outside King's College in London, where...

7
00:00:40,567 --> 00:00:45,972
where people were invited to make up their own games to play on these patterns that we'd

8
00:00:46,012 --> 00:00:47,053
laid down on the ground.

9
00:00:47,313 --> 00:00:51,376
They weren't quite games, they were just patterns that suggested games.

10
00:00:51,856 --> 00:00:57,121
So you got the things we expected, like groups of students playing with each other, or like

11
00:00:57,461 --> 00:01:01,784
lecturers on the way to give a lecture who didn't want to seem frivolous, but would sort

12
00:01:01,884 --> 00:01:07,709
of walk between things in a very methodical way, but definitely not jump and not give

13
00:01:07,769 --> 00:01:09,471
away that they were playing or having fun.

14
00:01:10,801 --> 00:01:16,442
And then we had things we didn't expect, like a guy on an hour-long business call

15
00:01:16,562 --> 00:01:20,684
standing out in there in the wind one day, the wind billowing his jacket,

16
00:01:20,724 --> 00:01:23,564
and we were watching from the windows on the sixth floor,

17
00:01:23,624 --> 00:01:26,205
taking notes to see if the project had worked.

18
00:01:26,265 --> 00:01:29,326
And as his phone call went on, over the course of an hour,

19
00:01:29,366 --> 00:01:33,767
he started pacing, first within the paths of the maze.

20
00:01:34,547 --> 00:01:37,290
and then balancing along the lines of the maze.

21
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:39,071
And by the time he was 45 minutes

22
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:42,634
into this clearly incredibly tedious phone call,

23
00:01:42,674 --> 00:01:45,917
he was jumping from triangle to triangle,

24
00:01:45,977 --> 00:01:49,560
the jacket going, ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump, behind him.

25
00:01:50,301 --> 00:01:54,728
So we do things like that, and we do silly little things like Art Deck,

26
00:01:54,788 --> 00:01:58,613
which we made for No Quarter in New York last year,

27
00:01:58,674 --> 00:02:03,260
which is a game where you collaborate to make instructions for drawings,

28
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:04,883
and then you execute those drawings.

29
00:02:05,604 --> 00:02:08,725
Or like this for children playing with an overhead projector.

30
00:02:09,205 --> 00:02:13,728
And for children, overhead projectors are now this amazing high-tech thing that they

31
00:02:13,748 --> 00:02:15,089
have never seen before.

32
00:02:15,449 --> 00:02:19,651
They're excited and thrilled by something that they assume is entirely digital while

33
00:02:19,671 --> 00:02:22,373
their parents stand around getting nostalgic.

34
00:02:23,573 --> 00:02:26,154
We also run a little festival called Now Play This,

35
00:02:26,635 --> 00:02:29,476
where last year we focused in particular on games

36
00:02:29,516 --> 00:02:31,997
that had an element of player creativity.

37
00:02:32,617 --> 00:02:35,778
So we showed things like Action Painting Pro by Ian McClarty

38
00:02:35,858 --> 00:02:38,059
and Inks by State of Play,

39
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:42,000
and a load of different games where people were invited

40
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,622
to write or compose or perform or otherwise create something

41
00:02:48,123 --> 00:02:50,023
within the course of the gameplay itself.

42
00:02:52,058 --> 00:02:53,579
And that's what I'm talking about today.

43
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:56,180
I'm talking about games where people are invited

44
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,481
to create something as part

45
00:02:57,521 --> 00:02:59,341
of their core gameplay experience.

46
00:02:59,882 --> 00:03:03,643
So sometimes charming freeware like Nico DÃ¼sseldorf's

47
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:06,904
Castles Made of Castles, which is a fractal building game,

48
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:09,966
iOS games like State of Play by Inks,

49
00:03:10,346 --> 00:03:12,847
where you're making a game of pinball

50
00:03:12,887 --> 00:03:15,668
where as you splatter the ball against the sides,

51
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,269
huge bursts of color come out and make a,

52
00:03:18,649 --> 00:03:20,731
a pattern, a record of how you've played.

53
00:03:21,272 --> 00:03:25,615
And Toka Hair Salon too, where you give your clients haircuts

54
00:03:25,876 --> 00:03:27,497
and they're beautifully animated.

55
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:31,761
And whatever you do with their hair, they are so delighted.

56
00:03:31,821 --> 00:03:34,463
They make little noises of pleasure and delight

57
00:03:34,504 --> 00:03:36,005
and occasionally confusion,

58
00:03:36,045 --> 00:03:37,526
but the confusion always resolves

59
00:03:37,586 --> 00:03:39,868
into this delighted face at the end.

60
00:03:39,908 --> 00:03:42,110
Whatever you do to their hair, they love it.

61
00:03:42,791 --> 00:03:46,878
Things like Media Molecule's Dreams, where the whole pitch is that you can create anything you want,

62
00:03:46,998 --> 00:03:51,927
or Elegy for a Dead World, where you're invited to write a poem within the course of play.

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,566
And also things like Dixit and Pictionary and board games that get people making creatively.

64
00:03:58,166 --> 00:04:03,893
And things like Just Add People which is a gorgeous instant architecture game where groups

65
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:11,301
of people collaborate with these little nodules and sticks to make wireframes of buildings

66
00:04:11,701 --> 00:04:12,522
collaboratively.

67
00:04:13,303 --> 00:04:18,605
Even things like Exquisite Corpse, you know that parlor game where you draw a bit of a picture

68
00:04:18,685 --> 00:04:22,827
and you leave some lines hanging off and you fold it over, you give it to someone else,

69
00:04:23,127 --> 00:04:27,588
they draw a bit more of it and then at the end you unfold it, which is both a game that kids

70
00:04:27,628 --> 00:04:32,370
play in primary school and also a game that the artists from the 1920s onwards have genuinely

71
00:04:32,410 --> 00:04:35,651
played as a way to generate interesting work.

72
00:04:36,172 --> 00:04:42,861
So everything in this sort of range of games that invite you to make something in the course of playing.

73
00:04:42,901 --> 00:04:49,310
And I think the various techniques that you can use are very, very transferable between digital and physical games here.

74
00:04:51,353 --> 00:04:52,755
So over the course of the next...

75
00:04:54,263 --> 00:04:56,344
however long I've got, 25 minutes left.

76
00:04:56,764 --> 00:04:59,265
I'm going to be talking about why we might want people

77
00:04:59,285 --> 00:05:01,766
to create things as part of our games.

78
00:05:02,666 --> 00:05:04,527
I'm going to talk about what stops people

79
00:05:04,567 --> 00:05:05,847
from wanting to create things,

80
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:07,408
both within games and generally.

81
00:05:07,428 --> 00:05:09,889
And then I'm going to talk about some techniques

82
00:05:09,909 --> 00:05:12,370
that different games use to break through

83
00:05:12,410 --> 00:05:13,870
that reluctance to create,

84
00:05:14,350 --> 00:05:15,971
and the way that the different techniques

85
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,772
encourage different particular types of creativity.

86
00:05:20,505 --> 00:05:21,485
But first, why?

87
00:05:21,725 --> 00:05:24,727
Why would we even want to do this in the first place?

88
00:05:26,188 --> 00:05:28,609
To start off with, getting involved

89
00:05:28,669 --> 00:05:30,190
in making something within a game

90
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,951
can increase your sense of investment

91
00:05:31,991 --> 00:05:33,852
within that game as a player.

92
00:05:34,293 --> 00:05:37,495
This game here is a super lovely walking game

93
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:42,498
where players generate a random walk that directs them

94
00:05:42,858 --> 00:05:44,619
around a building or around a park.

95
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,640
But before they start playing, they

96
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:48,522
have to fold the paper of the dice

97
00:05:48,562 --> 00:05:50,264
that they're using to generate that walk,

98
00:05:50,304 --> 00:05:53,106
and they have to write an extra instruction on it themselves.

99
00:05:53,546 --> 00:05:56,029
The designers could very easily have pre-folded these

100
00:05:56,089 --> 00:05:57,650
or got the dice printed in advance.

101
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:59,792
But having that process where you're

102
00:06:00,212 --> 00:06:03,055
making the thing that you then use in the course of the play

103
00:06:03,395 --> 00:06:04,776
makes people excited about it.

104
00:06:05,056 --> 00:06:08,379
We know this as a logic behind character creators, right?

105
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:10,741
If you've made a thing and it feels personal to you,

106
00:06:10,801 --> 00:06:13,043
then your investment in the game experience is greater.

107
00:06:14,615 --> 00:06:18,457
And partly because of this, getting people to create things in games is a really good

108
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,218
way of encouraging them to share stuff.

109
00:06:20,698 --> 00:06:23,460
And again, we know this about people in general, right?

110
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,082
If you're sharing a picture of a cake on Facebook, the chances are it's a cake that you made

111
00:06:28,122 --> 00:06:28,622
yourself.

112
00:06:29,002 --> 00:06:32,604
It's not a cake you just happen to be proximate to at some point.

113
00:06:33,044 --> 00:06:37,486
If you have a baby on the lock screen of your phone, it might be a baby that you gave birth

114
00:06:37,546 --> 00:06:38,167
to yourself.

115
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:39,287
It's probably not.

116
00:06:39,727 --> 00:06:45,253
a baby that someone else is raising even if their baby is way cuter than your baby.

117
00:06:46,154 --> 00:06:49,898
When we make a thing we feel like it says something about ourselves and it's things

118
00:06:49,938 --> 00:06:53,181
that say something about ourselves that we want to share with our friends and family.

119
00:06:55,213 --> 00:06:58,995
Creating something within a game can provide a change of tone.

120
00:06:59,075 --> 00:07:02,316
It can give you a moment away from the hurry, bury, hurly

121
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:05,258
burly of the game itself without taking you out of the game

122
00:07:05,318 --> 00:07:05,618
world.

123
00:07:06,098 --> 00:07:09,459
It can give you a moment to do something funny or restful

124
00:07:09,619 --> 00:07:11,600
or without the stress of whatever it is that you're

125
00:07:11,620 --> 00:07:12,561
trying to accomplish.

126
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:14,882
A moment to pause and breathe but still

127
00:07:14,942 --> 00:07:16,102
remain within the game.

128
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,808
It can get people to create wonderful things,

129
00:07:20,028 --> 00:07:21,930
and I guess I don't really need to explain

130
00:07:21,950 --> 00:07:23,771
why creating wonderful things is good, right?

131
00:07:24,011 --> 00:07:25,293
Having wonderful things is nice.

132
00:07:25,633 --> 00:07:26,694
Let's have some more of them.

133
00:07:28,015 --> 00:07:30,657
It can help players develop skills and understanding

134
00:07:30,697 --> 00:07:32,059
about how to make stuff,

135
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,901
which are then transferable outside of the game.

136
00:07:34,941 --> 00:07:37,824
They can make people write things or draw things

137
00:07:37,884 --> 00:07:40,566
and learn about the tools and the scope of their skills

138
00:07:40,886 --> 00:07:42,248
and expand those slightly.

139
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:47,472
And finally, they can just be really, really good fun.

140
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,933
Making stuff is nice.

141
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,034
Making stuff is satisfying and delightful.

142
00:07:52,375 --> 00:07:54,856
We're mostly here because we're super lucky

143
00:07:54,876 --> 00:07:56,277
and get to make games.

144
00:07:57,097 --> 00:07:59,579
And not everyone gets to make stuff as part of their job,

145
00:07:59,619 --> 00:08:03,461
but everyone has the capacity to enjoy the process of making

146
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,942
to feel satisfaction and delight

147
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,163
at a thing that they have made.

148
00:08:07,883 --> 00:08:11,605
And for a form, games, which trucks so much in satisfaction and delight,

149
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:15,946
neglecting the possibility of making one of the main things that gives people

150
00:08:16,306 --> 00:08:18,607
those experiences just seems silly.

151
00:08:20,787 --> 00:08:26,049
So there's a load of different reasons that you might want to get people creating within a game,

152
00:08:26,149 --> 00:08:30,310
but getting them to actually do it can be super, super difficult.

153
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:35,931
There's plenty of evidence that this is particularly the case for games rather than for any other form.

154
00:08:36,332 --> 00:08:38,692
because, for example, games often provide people

155
00:08:38,732 --> 00:08:40,993
with these extrinsic rewards.

156
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:42,934
And there's plenty of research that shows

157
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:45,995
that having an extrinsic reward for doing something creative

158
00:08:46,055 --> 00:08:47,975
will lower your motivation to continue

159
00:08:47,995 --> 00:08:48,976
doing that creative thing.

160
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,476
And also sometimes make the creative work

161
00:08:51,496 --> 00:08:52,997
that you do do worse.

162
00:08:53,697 --> 00:08:55,718
And there's not that many games around that

163
00:08:55,758 --> 00:08:56,978
do this to use as models.

164
00:08:57,358 --> 00:09:00,839
This is a quotation from a guy's MA in 2014,

165
00:09:01,319 --> 00:09:04,220
which was an MA specifically looking at games that were

166
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:05,681
used to encourage creativity.

167
00:09:06,221 --> 00:09:08,102
And in the introduction he's just like,

168
00:09:08,763 --> 00:09:10,844
I had a look, there basically aren't any,

169
00:09:11,204 --> 00:09:13,005
this MA has to be totally theoretical.

170
00:09:13,426 --> 00:09:15,287
And I don't want to criticize the MA,

171
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:16,828
it was a super interesting piece of work,

172
00:09:16,868 --> 00:09:18,249
I recommend going and having a look at it

173
00:09:18,289 --> 00:09:19,690
if you're interested in this kind of thing.

174
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,792
But the fact that even someone who's interested enough

175
00:09:23,812 --> 00:09:25,734
in this topic to be writing an MA on it

176
00:09:26,234 --> 00:09:28,956
isn't necessarily aware of prior work in this area

177
00:09:29,316 --> 00:09:32,078
means we are kind of acting at a disadvantage.

178
00:09:33,802 --> 00:09:36,567
But there's also things that aren't specific to games,

179
00:09:36,728 --> 00:09:39,173
but are specific to getting people to create

180
00:09:39,493 --> 00:09:41,517
under any circumstances whatsoever.

181
00:09:42,119 --> 00:09:44,824
So here we have this drawing of a window again.

182
00:09:47,777 --> 00:09:50,319
My friend Sarah drew this drawing of a window

183
00:09:50,359 --> 00:09:52,000
when I made her sit down at a table

184
00:09:52,220 --> 00:09:54,862
and there was some graph paper and some marker pens

185
00:09:55,262 --> 00:09:56,723
and I said, draw a window.

186
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:59,485
And because she's very obliging, she did,

187
00:09:59,985 --> 00:10:02,367
but it's not a very good window

188
00:10:02,387 --> 00:10:04,809
and she didn't enjoy drawing it

189
00:10:05,269 --> 00:10:06,950
and altogether at the end of the process,

190
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:08,611
she was significantly less happy

191
00:10:08,952 --> 00:10:10,513
than before I made her draw a window.

192
00:10:11,841 --> 00:10:13,862
And the reasons that she didn't like this were

193
00:10:13,962 --> 00:10:16,764
that she didn't know how to do it.

194
00:10:17,024 --> 00:10:18,925
She didn't particularly know the characteristics

195
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:20,726
of the marker pen that she was working with.

196
00:10:21,067 --> 00:10:24,349
She didn't really have any background in visual arts.

197
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:27,511
So being demanded that she draw a window out of nowhere

198
00:10:27,551 --> 00:10:28,971
is incredibly uninviting.

199
00:10:29,011 --> 00:10:31,033
I would hate it if someone jumped out and yelled,

200
00:10:31,073 --> 00:10:33,434
Holly, Holly, write a poem now

201
00:10:33,494 --> 00:10:34,995
when I was going about my normal day.

202
00:10:36,192 --> 00:10:37,913
It's because of a lack of confidence,

203
00:10:38,013 --> 00:10:39,814
which is related to a lack of ability,

204
00:10:39,854 --> 00:10:42,415
but it's not necessarily the same thing.

205
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:45,557
In fact, people who have a little bit of ability in an area

206
00:10:45,617 --> 00:10:47,658
are sometimes way less confident

207
00:10:47,698 --> 00:10:50,720
because their expectations for themselves are higher,

208
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,621
and their fear that they'll look silly

209
00:10:52,661 --> 00:10:54,882
if they make something bad is greater.

210
00:10:55,322 --> 00:10:57,123
So you have to address lack of ability

211
00:10:57,223 --> 00:10:59,905
and lack of confidence in your ability separately.

212
00:11:01,484 --> 00:11:03,806
And finally, lack of motivation.

213
00:11:04,066 --> 00:11:06,248
Like, I didn't tell Sarah that I would use this window

214
00:11:06,288 --> 00:11:07,809
in a talk, or at least not until later.

215
00:11:08,109 --> 00:11:09,250
I just said, draw a window.

216
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:12,693
She had no idea why she was meant to be drawing a window,

217
00:11:13,354 --> 00:11:14,635
why she might want to do that,

218
00:11:14,815 --> 00:11:16,496
and what she would get from it.

219
00:11:16,936 --> 00:11:18,538
And that's another thing that people often

220
00:11:18,578 --> 00:11:20,720
find themselves up against when asked to create.

221
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,081
Why am I doing this?

222
00:11:22,701 --> 00:11:23,602
Why would I want to?

223
00:11:23,662 --> 00:11:24,902
Is someone going to laugh at me?

224
00:11:25,002 --> 00:11:25,923
Can I even do it?

225
00:11:26,203 --> 00:11:27,144
What will I get out of it?

226
00:11:27,444 --> 00:11:29,405
These three core worries, lack of ability,

227
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:31,766
lack of confidence, and lack of motivation.

228
00:11:32,467 --> 00:11:35,689
And not all players will experience all of these lacks,

229
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:37,490
but someone will experience all of them.

230
00:11:37,850 --> 00:11:39,671
And in order to successfully get people

231
00:11:39,711 --> 00:11:41,012
creating within your game,

232
00:11:41,472 --> 00:11:44,174
you need to address all of them simultaneously.

233
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:48,355
So just to recap, people often don't have the ability

234
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:50,255
and the confidence and motivation to create things

235
00:11:50,315 --> 00:11:50,956
within a game.

236
00:11:51,556 --> 00:11:53,756
But if they do, if we can overcome it,

237
00:11:53,816 --> 00:11:56,657
there are so many good reasons to get them doing it.

238
00:11:57,477 --> 00:11:59,038
So for the rest of the talk, I'm going

239
00:11:59,078 --> 00:12:01,418
to talk a little bit about different ways

240
00:12:01,478 --> 00:12:03,959
that games in the past have encouraged player creativity,

241
00:12:04,319 --> 00:12:07,020
how that tends to work, what the different techniques are.

242
00:12:09,065 --> 00:12:11,727
And the first one is by far the easiest.

243
00:12:12,128 --> 00:12:14,029
You just give your players instructions.

244
00:12:14,789 --> 00:12:16,731
You just tell them what to do.

245
00:12:18,812 --> 00:12:22,575
And that might even be very, very explicit instructions,

246
00:12:22,635 --> 00:12:25,157
the simplest of all ways to get people creating.

247
00:12:25,517 --> 00:12:27,639
You just tell them to do a thing,

248
00:12:28,259 --> 00:12:30,781
and maybe you even score them on how well they've done it.

249
00:12:31,561 --> 00:12:33,523
That might be recreating a picture,

250
00:12:33,923 --> 00:12:36,525
might be singing a song, might be doing a dance.

251
00:12:37,285 --> 00:12:42,187
I'm really, really, really bad at singing, like spectacularly bad at singing.

252
00:12:42,487 --> 00:12:47,149
I have a range of four notes, and whenever I open my mouth, it's almost totally random

253
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,089
which of those four notes is going to come out.

254
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:55,251
But I love SingStar anyway because its instructions are so explicit, and the thing that it's getting

255
00:12:55,291 --> 00:12:58,212
me to focus on is such a minimal part of singing.

256
00:12:58,332 --> 00:13:00,273
It's try to get a correct note.

257
00:13:00,853 --> 00:13:02,775
and then do it for the right amount of time.

258
00:13:03,155 --> 00:13:05,097
It doesn't care about my expression,

259
00:13:05,157 --> 00:13:07,819
it doesn't care about any of the fancy singing words

260
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:10,061
that I'm so bad at singing I don't even know what they are.

261
00:13:10,621 --> 00:13:12,263
And people who are really good at singing

262
00:13:12,323 --> 00:13:14,404
sometimes find SingStar really frustrating

263
00:13:14,444 --> 00:13:15,465
because it doesn't allow them

264
00:13:15,505 --> 00:13:17,287
that range of creative expression.

265
00:13:17,327 --> 00:13:18,648
But for someone like me,

266
00:13:19,088 --> 00:13:21,230
having these very, very explicit instructions

267
00:13:21,310 --> 00:13:23,392
is reassuring, it takes away the pressure,

268
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,593
it tells me what I'm meant to do

269
00:13:24,633 --> 00:13:26,454
and it gives me a way to figure out

270
00:13:26,554 --> 00:13:28,156
if I'm doing it right or not.

271
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,985
A lot of dancing games do a really interesting thing where they find a way to give people

272
00:13:34,025 --> 00:13:38,750
that sort of support and comfort, but also still allow for creative expression.

273
00:13:39,191 --> 00:13:43,576
So for example, if you play Just Dance just using your phone as the thing, then the game

274
00:13:43,616 --> 00:13:45,879
is only looking at what that one hand does.

275
00:13:45,939 --> 00:13:47,661
It doesn't care what you do with your feet.

276
00:13:48,041 --> 00:13:51,222
So people who want to be fancy and be more creatively expressive can,

277
00:13:51,542 --> 00:13:54,463
and people who just want to focus on that one hand can do that.

278
00:13:54,923 --> 00:13:59,805
Dance Dance Revolution back in the day is still my favourite dancing game of all time

279
00:13:59,845 --> 00:14:04,326
because it focuses on your feet and then leaves people who want to be fancy,

280
00:14:04,366 --> 00:14:07,127
want to spin around and wave their arms around to do that.

281
00:14:07,647 --> 00:14:10,028
But people who need that reassurance and hand-holding

282
00:14:10,068 --> 00:14:12,228
can just focus on doing the right things.

283
00:14:13,464 --> 00:14:15,885
So explicit instructions can level the playing field

284
00:14:15,945 --> 00:14:18,027
by focusing on a particular area

285
00:14:18,107 --> 00:14:21,029
rather than requiring everyone to be good at everything

286
00:14:21,130 --> 00:14:24,592
all at once, and they can hold you safe and make it okay.

287
00:14:24,832 --> 00:14:26,754
They can tell you what you're meant to do,

288
00:14:27,154 --> 00:14:30,057
and you can just concentrate entirely on execution.

289
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:32,899
Sometimes you get tension between the scoring systems

290
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:35,501
and what would actually make for a good creative work,

291
00:14:36,021 --> 00:14:37,282
and it can be difficult to leave space

292
00:14:37,302 --> 00:14:38,303
for creative expression,

293
00:14:38,803 --> 00:14:41,105
but these things are really, really useful.

294
00:14:42,958 --> 00:14:46,021
Another slightly subtler way to give people instructions

295
00:14:46,081 --> 00:14:48,803
is to not necessarily tell them what to do step by step,

296
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:50,305
but to give them a prompt.

297
00:14:50,745 --> 00:14:54,169
You give people a blank canvas with a specific task,

298
00:14:54,589 --> 00:14:56,411
but you don't tell them how to do that task.

299
00:14:57,760 --> 00:15:01,061
So this, this is a different window,

300
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:03,502
and this is another drawing that Sarah did

301
00:15:03,542 --> 00:15:06,042
immediately afterwards when I pointed at a window

302
00:15:06,142 --> 00:15:09,343
in the corner of the flat and said, draw this window.

303
00:15:09,363 --> 00:15:13,624
And this is still not a masterpiece of modern art, sure,

304
00:15:13,664 --> 00:15:15,465
but it's a way more interesting drawing,

305
00:15:15,565 --> 00:15:17,285
and also she had a nicer time doing it.

306
00:15:17,645 --> 00:15:19,125
And at the end, she felt confident

307
00:15:19,165 --> 00:15:21,066
that she had done roughly the correct thing,

308
00:15:21,346 --> 00:15:22,406
because she could look at the window

309
00:15:22,426 --> 00:15:23,667
and look at the thing she'd drawn and go,

310
00:15:23,707 --> 00:15:26,027
yeah, yeah, all right, that's approximately correct.

311
00:15:26,982 --> 00:15:29,422
Elegy for a Dead World is really instructive here

312
00:15:29,462 --> 00:15:32,503
because I've been super open about their design process

313
00:15:32,543 --> 00:15:33,904
and how when they started off,

314
00:15:34,324 --> 00:15:36,925
people who played just felt sad.

315
00:15:37,965 --> 00:15:39,406
Initially, they presented people

316
00:15:39,426 --> 00:15:40,786
with these beautiful landscapes

317
00:15:40,926 --> 00:15:43,307
and then just said, write a poem.

318
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:46,382
which made people feel bad about themselves

319
00:15:46,602 --> 00:15:49,445
and made people feel insecure and didn't result in any poems.

320
00:15:50,165 --> 00:15:52,308
And so over the course of the design process,

321
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:54,370
they iterated on this and started off

322
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:57,493
by giving people incredibly specific prompts that

323
00:15:57,533 --> 00:15:59,715
might just be filling in one sentence or two

324
00:15:59,775 --> 00:16:01,677
or a single word of a sentence.

325
00:16:02,077 --> 00:16:03,318
And then over the course of the game,

326
00:16:03,358 --> 00:16:06,181
as people's confidence grew, it became broader and broader

327
00:16:06,201 --> 00:16:08,163
about the things that they were being invited to do.

328
00:16:09,212 --> 00:16:12,976
So if we look back at the three things that stop people creating, sort of lack of ability

329
00:16:13,156 --> 00:16:16,820
and confidence and motivation, a prompt can help with all of those.

330
00:16:17,381 --> 00:16:21,785
It helps with ability by answering the question of what am I meant to do at all.

331
00:16:22,406 --> 00:16:27,531
It helps with confidence by hand-holding you a bit through it and also giving you an excuse

332
00:16:27,571 --> 00:16:28,772
if the thing isn't good.

333
00:16:29,372 --> 00:16:35,317
Right if you are told to do something and it's terrible and it's something you chose to do yourself you feel bad

334
00:16:35,517 --> 00:16:40,460
but if it's something the game has told you to do then you don't feel like it's your fault as much and

335
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:44,763
finally it helps with motivation by by sparking curiosity a

336
00:16:45,904 --> 00:16:51,588
Well chosen prompt can get people wanting to jump in and finish it it can motivate them if I say

337
00:16:52,288 --> 00:16:57,352
there was a young man from New York who wanted to learn how to

338
00:16:59,065 --> 00:17:00,546
and I just leave a space there,

339
00:17:00,866 --> 00:17:02,426
then your brain wants to fill it in.

340
00:17:02,526 --> 00:17:03,607
Talk, walk, what is it?

341
00:17:03,627 --> 00:17:05,167
You want to pick the best thing for it.

342
00:17:05,487 --> 00:17:08,288
It's this moment that's both easy to respond to

343
00:17:08,388 --> 00:17:09,608
and slightly intriguing.

344
00:17:10,449 --> 00:17:11,809
So prompts do all of these things.

345
00:17:11,829 --> 00:17:13,489
They make tasks less scary,

346
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,110
and they also encourage people

347
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:19,731
to feel like they're responding to the game

348
00:17:19,811 --> 00:17:22,532
rather than just responding to something inside themselves.

349
00:17:23,551 --> 00:17:26,913
They can be difficult, you can get something that's either too vague or too specific,

350
00:17:27,274 --> 00:17:30,816
and you have to make sure you're allowing space for players to genuinely be expressive,

351
00:17:31,036 --> 00:17:33,298
which you might need to build up over the course of the game.

352
00:17:33,778 --> 00:17:37,601
But prompts are, I think, probably my very, very favourite way to get people making stuff.

353
00:17:39,045 --> 00:17:42,067
Final type of instruction, slightly vaguer one,

354
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:42,947
much more enigmatic.

355
00:17:42,967 --> 00:17:45,309
And I think this one is generally underused.

356
00:17:45,629 --> 00:17:48,350
This is where the game doesn't give you upfront instructions,

357
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:50,491
but instead responds to what you do

358
00:17:50,531 --> 00:17:52,913
in a way that makes you want to figure out what it wants,

359
00:17:53,913 --> 00:17:55,254
makes you want to try to please it.

360
00:17:55,334 --> 00:17:57,715
So this is Joy Exhibition by Strangethink,

361
00:17:57,735 --> 00:18:01,217
where you make these spray paint gun paintings,

362
00:18:01,557 --> 00:18:04,699
and they go up and aliens wander around and look at them.

363
00:18:05,059 --> 00:18:06,960
And sometimes they'll stop in front of a picture.

364
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:10,140
And it might be totally random.

365
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,241
I think it probably is.

366
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,002
But as you play for the first 10 minutes,

367
00:18:13,362 --> 00:18:15,683
you try to figure out what they want from a picture.

368
00:18:15,723 --> 00:18:17,504
You go back, try to make a new picture

369
00:18:17,524 --> 00:18:19,265
that they'll like more and present it to them.

370
00:18:19,805 --> 00:18:21,706
Pippin Barr's art game does the same thing.

371
00:18:22,166 --> 00:18:25,147
You basically play Tetris to make a sculpture.

372
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:27,929
Then you phone up the tiny cartoon curator

373
00:18:28,269 --> 00:18:29,549
who comes along and tells you

374
00:18:29,609 --> 00:18:31,570
if your sculpture is any good or not.

375
00:18:32,150 --> 00:18:35,852
And I have no idea how the curator figures this out,

376
00:18:36,212 --> 00:18:38,713
but trying to please them becomes the core of the game,

377
00:18:38,753 --> 00:18:40,573
and you're driven to go back and do that again.

378
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:44,935
This is one of the more interesting windows

379
00:18:44,995 --> 00:18:47,676
that Sarah drew, and when she drew this one,

380
00:18:47,756 --> 00:18:50,537
I just sat nearby and made noises.

381
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:53,958
Like, ah, and mm, as she drew.

382
00:18:53,978 --> 00:18:57,399
And I was, again, making them totally at random.

383
00:18:58,499 --> 00:19:05,782
But she interpreted them enough to try to drive her to do things and experiment with things that she otherwise wouldn't have.

384
00:19:06,062 --> 00:19:09,564
She had the same amount of instructions as the first time I said, draw a window,

385
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:12,505
but she also had me sitting there seeming to respond to it.

386
00:19:12,945 --> 00:19:18,527
And that seeming response was the thing that drove her to explore different ways of making and different things that she could do,

387
00:19:18,887 --> 00:19:23,109
in the desperate hope that, I guess, I would eventually let her stop drawing windows.

388
00:19:24,818 --> 00:19:28,672
So instructions, great, but very upfront,

389
00:19:28,752 --> 00:19:30,579
very aimed at a particular sort of thing.

390
00:19:31,560 --> 00:19:34,282
Another thing that you can do is give your players an excuse.

391
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:37,724
This helps in particular with lack of confidence.

392
00:19:37,784 --> 00:19:40,265
People are scared about making a thing that's bad.

393
00:19:40,986 --> 00:19:44,067
Well, if you give them an excuse for why it's bad,

394
00:19:44,127 --> 00:19:45,508
they don't have to be scared anymore.

395
00:19:46,008 --> 00:19:48,570
So you can do this by increasing the difficulty, for example,

396
00:19:48,930 --> 00:19:52,232
and making it really, really hard to make a good thing.

397
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:54,993
This is a window that Sarah drew with her foot.

398
00:19:55,553 --> 00:19:57,494
and it's terrible, but of course it's terrible.

399
00:19:57,534 --> 00:19:59,655
She was holding a marker pen between her toes.

400
00:20:00,116 --> 00:20:02,136
And I think she had more fun drawing this one

401
00:20:02,156 --> 00:20:03,417
than any other window.

402
00:20:03,677 --> 00:20:05,458
And she didn't care that it was terrible.

403
00:20:06,258 --> 00:20:08,519
And we know about this in building games, for example,

404
00:20:08,539 --> 00:20:11,741
which are constantly coming up with tornadoes and dinosaurs

405
00:20:11,781 --> 00:20:13,602
to get in the way of things that you're trying to make.

406
00:20:14,182 --> 00:20:16,643
We know that with games like Fake Artist Goes to New York,

407
00:20:16,683 --> 00:20:19,064
where it's difficult because you're trying to draw something

408
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,905
without giving away what the thing you're drawing is

409
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:24,266
to a spy within your ranks.

410
00:20:24,987 --> 00:20:27,527
So difficulty relieves the pressure to make something good

411
00:20:27,567 --> 00:20:30,248
and makes you feel better about whatever it is that you do make.

412
00:20:31,369 --> 00:20:33,830
If you make it so there's no chance of making something good,

413
00:20:33,850 --> 00:20:35,530
then it can be a quite shallow game.

414
00:20:35,570 --> 00:20:36,871
You'll only get people engaging with it

415
00:20:36,891 --> 00:20:38,431
for a relatively short amount of time.

416
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,532
But even that shallow engagement can be an enormous amount of fun.

417
00:20:43,138 --> 00:20:45,959
Another sort of excuse you can give is limiting the control

418
00:20:46,039 --> 00:20:49,461
that players have over the output of their actions.

419
00:20:50,102 --> 00:20:52,023
So the relationship between what they do

420
00:20:52,063 --> 00:20:54,864
and what the game does in response is maybe enigmatic,

421
00:20:55,024 --> 00:20:57,166
or maybe you only get to make one decision

422
00:20:57,226 --> 00:20:58,506
every five or 10 seconds.

423
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:00,828
So you get something like become a great artist

424
00:21:00,888 --> 00:21:03,649
in just 10 seconds, where you're first presented

425
00:21:03,689 --> 00:21:06,591
with a ridiculously difficult demand to, for example,

426
00:21:06,671 --> 00:21:08,492
recreate a picture precisely.

427
00:21:08,832 --> 00:21:10,973
So there's already difficulty acting as an excuse.

428
00:21:11,694 --> 00:21:15,236
But then there's a really enigmatic relationship between what you do and what comes up.

429
00:21:15,276 --> 00:21:20,160
You press a button on the keyboard and then something happens to your bright glitchy drawing

430
00:21:20,220 --> 00:21:24,363
which might transform it, like, unstoppably, irreversibly.

431
00:21:24,884 --> 00:21:29,347
And so what you start doing is not necessarily trying to do what the game tells you to do,

432
00:21:29,387 --> 00:21:33,910
but exploring the possible space of things that you can make within this enigmatic tool.

433
00:21:34,843 --> 00:21:38,304
You get music games like Shikian and Looks Like Music that do a similar thing,

434
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,185
which translate someone's physical drawings into sound.

435
00:21:41,505 --> 00:21:45,106
And so what you do is explore the space of different noises that you can make.

436
00:21:45,606 --> 00:21:47,867
And music games tend to do this quite a lot, right?

437
00:21:48,207 --> 00:21:51,108
You're not necessarily trying to make something from scratch,

438
00:21:51,148 --> 00:21:53,349
and the relationship between what you do and what you get.

439
00:21:53,709 --> 00:21:57,051
can be very, very vague, but you gradually feel it out

440
00:21:57,111 --> 00:21:59,051
and you're motivated to explore the space

441
00:21:59,091 --> 00:22:01,793
of possible things that you can make.

442
00:22:02,293 --> 00:22:04,374
So limiting the control that people have

443
00:22:04,754 --> 00:22:07,095
is really great for getting them to make something

444
00:22:07,175 --> 00:22:09,916
within a set of aesthetics that already exist

445
00:22:10,296 --> 00:22:11,457
and explore what's possible

446
00:22:11,497 --> 00:22:12,878
and make something that speaks to them.

447
00:22:13,538 --> 00:22:15,659
It can be a risk that you end up with people

448
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:16,859
making things that look the same,

449
00:22:16,879 --> 00:22:18,680
so you have to make sure there's a really wide range

450
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,081
of expression possible within it.

451
00:22:20,601 --> 00:22:23,342
But if that's done, then the sky's the limit.

452
00:22:24,860 --> 00:22:26,403
Okay, distracting your players.

453
00:22:26,804 --> 00:22:30,569
So you give players a different non-creative task to do

454
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:33,133
at the same time that they're doing the creative task.

455
00:22:33,494 --> 00:22:35,096
This is very good for being funny.

456
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:38,401
This is a window that Sarah drew

457
00:22:38,441 --> 00:22:41,163
while I also got her to say her times tables

458
00:22:41,203 --> 00:22:43,103
from one by one through to 10 by 10.

459
00:22:43,244 --> 00:22:45,505
And when she got to 10 by 10, she had to stop.

460
00:22:46,385 --> 00:22:48,186
And I think this is, of all of the windows,

461
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:50,907
my actual favorite because she was distracted

462
00:22:50,947 --> 00:22:52,948
from thinking too much about what she was doing

463
00:22:52,988 --> 00:22:55,529
and being worried about it because she was focusing

464
00:22:55,569 --> 00:22:57,270
on saying her 10 times tables instead.

465
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,671
This obviously isn't a game.

466
00:23:00,051 --> 00:23:02,772
It's barely a step above bullying, but...

467
00:23:02,792 --> 00:23:03,493
Yeah.

468
00:23:04,353 --> 00:23:08,916
But if you look at games that do this well, what they tend to do is have something where

469
00:23:08,956 --> 00:23:13,939
the task that you're meant to do that is a distraction nonetheless feeds through into

470
00:23:13,959 --> 00:23:15,360
the creative thing that you're doing.

471
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:20,122
So Bounden gives you a little shape that you've got to keep in a particular area on the phone

472
00:23:20,163 --> 00:23:20,683
between you.

473
00:23:21,183 --> 00:23:26,086
And as you start moving in order to accomplish that, without you even necessarily noticing

474
00:23:26,126 --> 00:23:30,329
what you're doing, you start to dance because it's been choreographed to make you make these

475
00:23:30,369 --> 00:23:32,510
graceful movements while you're distracted.

476
00:23:33,531 --> 00:23:38,854
Pictionary, less beautiful than Bounden, but just as much fun.

477
00:23:38,934 --> 00:23:43,416
You get the distraction of trying to communicate something, and then you don't necessarily

478
00:23:43,476 --> 00:23:44,657
worry about what it is that you're doing.

479
00:23:44,717 --> 00:23:48,599
And again, the thing that you're doing as a distraction and the thing that you're doing

480
00:23:48,619 --> 00:23:50,901
that is a creative work are really tightly bound together.

481
00:23:51,621 --> 00:23:55,183
And Action Painting Pro, which is one of my very, very favorite games of all time,

482
00:23:55,223 --> 00:24:00,026
where you're a little figure jumping around, trying to keep enough sort of hearts and dollars

483
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:03,748
and light bulbs to continue making your artwork as you jump around.

484
00:24:04,228 --> 00:24:07,890
But you start picking up paint and leaving it in enormous tracks behind you.

485
00:24:08,530 --> 00:24:10,671
And at the end of the game, when you inevitably die,

486
00:24:11,092 --> 00:24:12,672
you have an artwork that you've created.

487
00:24:12,933 --> 00:24:16,895
And even if you start out trying to make a particular thing, you never manage to do that.

488
00:24:16,915 --> 00:24:18,876
You get distracted by the demands of the game.

489
00:24:19,911 --> 00:24:22,994
And then at the end you look with new eyes at the thing that you have made.

490
00:24:25,215 --> 00:24:27,117
You can use your players against each other.

491
00:24:27,177 --> 00:24:31,961
You can get them collaborating and working on a creative task together, which works really

492
00:24:32,001 --> 00:24:35,384
well because no one has sole responsibility for what they're doing.

493
00:24:35,784 --> 00:24:40,168
So in this case, Sarah and her girlfriend took turns to draw a line in the window, one

494
00:24:40,188 --> 00:24:42,210
of them in dark red and one of them in bright red.

495
00:24:42,850 --> 00:24:47,917
An Exquisite Corpse works like this as well, this collaborative art-making game that I

496
00:24:47,977 --> 00:24:48,798
made a few years ago.

497
00:24:48,818 --> 00:24:54,445
This super lovely thing by Scott Garner, which is a music game where you have to touch a

498
00:24:54,545 --> 00:24:58,270
star and the moon at the same time to make a particular note.

499
00:24:58,650 --> 00:25:01,631
But the stars are so far away that you need help from other people.

500
00:25:02,072 --> 00:25:03,672
And once you start holding hands with people,

501
00:25:03,712 --> 00:25:05,813
you no longer have sole control over the tune

502
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:08,014
and the music that you make as a result of it.

503
00:25:08,314 --> 00:25:11,135
So you feel freed up to just experiment and mess around

504
00:25:11,175 --> 00:25:14,936
without feeling like you have to create a great tune right now.

505
00:25:15,636 --> 00:25:18,737
So collaborating can get people feeling less responsible.

506
00:25:19,538 --> 00:25:21,998
The risk is that they have a limited sense of ownership at the end

507
00:25:22,058 --> 00:25:24,859
and getting them to feel proud of the thing that they've made is harder.

508
00:25:26,120 --> 00:25:29,982
Competition is another great one, getting people directly opposed to each other.

509
00:25:30,422 --> 00:25:35,005
I keep using Pictionary as an example because it uses quite a lot of these techniques really, really skillfully.

510
00:25:35,725 --> 00:25:39,207
You're not just distracted by having a name of communication,

511
00:25:39,247 --> 00:25:43,469
you're not just given a prompt of what to draw, but you're also desperate to beat someone else.

512
00:25:44,069 --> 00:25:50,573
And competition is possibly the best single way to overcome the question of why should I do this, of motivation.

513
00:25:50,913 --> 00:25:54,575
You're doing it because you don't want someone else to win, you want to win.

514
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,036
If people are on board with the idea of games at all,

515
00:25:58,316 --> 00:26:00,477
then they're generally on board with the idea of doing something

516
00:26:00,497 --> 00:26:02,417
in order to ensure a victory, right?

517
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:05,918
Again, you can get this tension between the creative work

518
00:26:05,958 --> 00:26:07,399
and the quality of the creative work

519
00:26:07,859 --> 00:26:10,619
and the best thing that you need to do in order to win the game,

520
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:14,020
but it's still a super, super powerful way to get people doing stuff.

521
00:26:15,653 --> 00:26:17,956
And finally, gifts and sharing.

522
00:26:18,456 --> 00:26:21,218
So people working together and playing a game together,

523
00:26:21,419 --> 00:26:23,360
making stuff for each other.

524
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:26,323
So this game where you're making music together

525
00:26:26,483 --> 00:26:28,185
and what you're doing is trying to support

526
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:29,286
the other person in their music.

527
00:26:29,806 --> 00:26:32,248
Or back in the days of draw something,

528
00:26:32,288 --> 00:26:35,411
people weren't necessarily trying to make a bee

529
00:26:35,491 --> 00:26:37,533
to communicate bee as quickly as possible.

530
00:26:37,553 --> 00:26:39,154
They were doing these elaborate drawings

531
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:41,477
to send to people as gifts.

532
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:45,840
So in social contexts where people like each other and already care about each other,

533
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:50,744
inviting people to make things for each other is really, really powerful.

534
00:26:51,024 --> 00:26:55,788
It can be intimidating because you need to make something for someone and they might hate it.

535
00:26:56,048 --> 00:26:58,670
So you have to work really, really hard at giving people confidence.

536
00:26:58,971 --> 00:27:00,612
But as a motivator, it's wonderful.

537
00:27:02,597 --> 00:27:03,977
Giving players a disguise.

538
00:27:04,437 --> 00:27:07,058
You don't necessarily ask them to create as themselves.

539
00:27:07,078 --> 00:27:08,518
You get them to take on a role.

540
00:27:08,939 --> 00:27:10,219
They're not writing a song.

541
00:27:10,599 --> 00:27:12,680
They're playing a character that's writing a song.

542
00:27:13,020 --> 00:27:15,281
Tabletop role-playing games have done this for ages.

543
00:27:15,961 --> 00:27:17,081
Live art does it a lot.

544
00:27:17,141 --> 00:27:18,042
Theater does it a lot.

545
00:27:18,462 --> 00:27:20,562
This is a game where you run around with capes

546
00:27:20,602 --> 00:27:21,703
that make different noises,

547
00:27:22,023 --> 00:27:23,463
and it's important that they're capes

548
00:27:23,563 --> 00:27:25,684
because the capes make you feel like someone else.

549
00:27:26,104 --> 00:27:27,044
You tell stories.

550
00:27:27,945 --> 00:27:29,326
as yourself, and that's scary.

551
00:27:29,366 --> 00:27:33,251
You tell stories as some sort of drunken 1700s baron,

552
00:27:33,591 --> 00:27:34,933
and it's less intimidating.

553
00:27:37,135 --> 00:27:41,380
And finally, you can help people make something within a game

554
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:43,382
by making it easier for your players

555
00:27:43,682 --> 00:27:45,304
to create something good.

556
00:27:46,811 --> 00:27:51,295
You can do that by smoothing out the edges of the things they make secretly,

557
00:27:51,856 --> 00:27:54,918
taking the thing that they've made and making it better.

558
00:27:55,399 --> 00:27:57,501
We made this game Art Deck that I mentioned before,

559
00:27:57,861 --> 00:28:01,665
and we spent a long time experimenting with different prompts to give people.

560
00:28:02,085 --> 00:28:05,728
We spent a long time experimenting with different marker pens and crayons

561
00:28:05,768 --> 00:28:07,410
and different things that people could use.

562
00:28:08,090 --> 00:28:11,513
But the single thing that we did that made the most difference to this game

563
00:28:11,973 --> 00:28:15,416
is we started at the end of the game putting a frame around it.

564
00:28:16,017 --> 00:28:17,438
And that made it feel more like a thing.

565
00:28:17,778 --> 00:28:22,802
And also it stopped people from being bad at drawing secretly.

566
00:28:23,142 --> 00:28:25,424
Because the main way that people are bad at drawing

567
00:28:25,764 --> 00:28:27,586
is they don't draw to the edge of the paper.

568
00:28:27,626 --> 00:28:29,987
This is the main thing that art teachers yell at children

569
00:28:30,007 --> 00:28:31,168
for the first two years of high school.

570
00:28:31,529 --> 00:28:34,691
Draw to the edge of the paper, fill the pages, look confident.

571
00:28:34,731 --> 00:28:37,033
If you have something sitting in the middle, it doesn't seem confident,

572
00:28:37,073 --> 00:28:38,655
it doesn't seem like a picture.

573
00:28:39,095 --> 00:28:41,797
So we just framed it and cut off the inch around it

574
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:43,919
after trying so many different game mechanics

575
00:28:43,959 --> 00:28:48,002
to get people to draw to the edge of the paper and failing.

576
00:28:48,423 --> 00:28:50,725
So you can be sneaky, you can make their stuff better.

577
00:28:53,087 --> 00:28:58,832
Obviously it means that you're making decisions about what better is so really innovative work can often get squashed down by that

578
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:03,036
But if you're happy with that then secret improvement is great

579
00:29:03,836 --> 00:29:07,580
You can give people a constraint that stops them from doing something bad

580
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:10,863
another thing that people often do badly when they're drawing is they do lots of little

581
00:29:10,903 --> 00:29:15,046
Unconfident lines or they put in lots of peripheral detail that detracts from the main thing

582
00:29:15,507 --> 00:29:16,167
So in this case

583
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,891
I didn't let Sarah take her pen off the paper and the thing that she got at the end of her

584
00:29:20,271 --> 00:29:22,534
was I think more interesting sort of visually

585
00:29:22,554 --> 00:29:24,275
than most of the other things that she drew.

586
00:29:25,216 --> 00:29:27,779
So a constraint can make something sound harder to do,

587
00:29:28,039 --> 00:29:29,361
so it relieves the pressure,

588
00:29:29,741 --> 00:29:31,643
but actually it makes it easier

589
00:29:31,763 --> 00:29:34,506
and it denies people access to bad decisions

590
00:29:34,526 --> 00:29:36,228
that they might otherwise make.

591
00:29:38,050 --> 00:29:40,733
And finally, practice, right?

592
00:29:41,973 --> 00:29:45,495
We make people good at stuff by making them genuinely good

593
00:29:45,536 --> 00:29:45,716
at them.

594
00:29:45,736 --> 00:29:48,017
We make people more confident by getting them to do something

595
00:29:48,037 --> 00:29:50,338
until they genuinely know more about how to do it.

596
00:29:51,119 --> 00:29:52,640
I want to be clear that I don't think

597
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:55,321
that games that encourage player creativity should necessarily

598
00:29:55,361 --> 00:29:59,523
be aimed at focusing on the quality of the creative work.

599
00:29:59,844 --> 00:30:01,925
But if we're getting someone to do something over and over

600
00:30:01,965 --> 00:30:03,886
again, it would be silly to neglect the possibility

601
00:30:03,906 --> 00:30:07,288
that they might end up being actually better at it

602
00:30:07,328 --> 00:30:08,268
than when they started.

603
00:30:10,287 --> 00:30:12,388
So to summarize, these are all different techniques

604
00:30:12,428 --> 00:30:16,329
that we can use to get people creating stuff within games,

605
00:30:16,769 --> 00:30:19,131
to get them experimenting and making and sharing

606
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,472
with each other and with people outside the game.

607
00:30:22,352 --> 00:30:24,393
There's particular stuff that we as game designers

608
00:30:24,433 --> 00:30:26,034
in particular need to watch out for,

609
00:30:26,114 --> 00:30:28,215
like the tension between gameplay and creation,

610
00:30:28,895 --> 00:30:31,636
or whether people get bored mechanically or creatively,

611
00:30:31,716 --> 00:30:33,677
right, there's two ways for them to get sick of your game.

612
00:30:34,769 --> 00:30:38,192
But if we can do that, then we've got this area that is,

613
00:30:38,272 --> 00:30:40,955
I think, genuinely one of the richest and most exciting

614
00:30:41,255 --> 00:30:44,598
places to dig around in in games and try to find new

615
00:30:44,658 --> 00:30:47,360
things that we can get people to do and get them to play.

616
00:30:48,161 --> 00:30:48,501
Thank you.
