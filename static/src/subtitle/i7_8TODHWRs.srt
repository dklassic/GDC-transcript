00:00:06,353 --> 00:00:07,214
Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:08,154 --> 00:00:10,174
Before we start today, I'm supposed to remind you

3
00:00:10,194 --> 00:00:11,835
that you're all seasoned pros at this point,

4
00:00:11,875 --> 00:00:14,416
to please just turn off all noise-making devices,

5
00:00:14,436 --> 00:00:17,136
and also that a survey will be sent out

6
00:00:17,276 --> 00:00:18,217
at the end of this talk.

7
00:00:18,877 --> 00:00:19,817
Just please fill that out.

8
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:21,738
It'll be super useful for me and super useful

9
00:00:21,758 --> 00:00:23,798
to the organizers of this awesome conference

10
00:00:24,438 --> 00:00:25,659
to figure out how to make the conference

11
00:00:25,699 --> 00:00:26,419
better for everyone.

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:32,122
So, hello, my name is Karen Tsai. I'm a senior engineering manager at Duolingo.

13
00:00:32,262 --> 00:00:37,424
And thanks for joining me today on this final stretch of an amazing conference.

14
00:00:38,545 --> 00:00:44,088
I'm here today to present lessons from Duolingo. How to make learning hard things easy.

15
00:00:44,228 --> 00:00:47,069
Now, how many people have used Duolingo before?

16
00:00:47,810 --> 00:00:50,671
Oh my gosh, that's so awesome to see. So many of you.

17
00:00:51,091 --> 00:00:56,154
Well, if you don't know what Duolingo is, we're an app that tries to teach you foreign languages for free.

18
00:00:56,654 --> 00:01:05,978
We have over 300 million users now, and we are frequently at the top of the charts for top-grossing and top-free education apps on both Google Play and iOS.

19
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:11,643
So you've probably heard of Duolingo, but you surely haven't heard of me, so let me give you a little bit of background.

20
00:01:12,603 --> 00:01:18,909
In undergrad, I majored in computer science with a minor in neuroscience, focusing on reinforcement learning.

21
00:01:19,509 --> 00:01:25,454
So the intersection of technology and of neuroscience and learning has always been a passion of mine.

22
00:01:26,395 --> 00:01:29,978
I'd like to think that I also had an unofficial minor in League of Legends,

23
00:01:30,178 --> 00:01:34,362
because I probably spent more time on League than on my neuroscience minor.

24
00:01:35,783 --> 00:01:40,905
And in the fall of 2012, I joined Duolingo as an engineer about three months after it

25
00:01:40,965 --> 00:01:41,346
launched.

26
00:01:41,526 --> 00:01:47,509
So I was able to see the app grow from under 1 million users to now over 300 million, and

27
00:01:47,889 --> 00:01:49,730
all the lovely bumps along the way.

28
00:01:51,211 --> 00:01:54,453
Nowadays, I'm the engineering manager for two teams at Duolingo.

29
00:01:54,833 --> 00:01:59,235
There's the courses team, which tries to make sure we're teaching the right content.

30
00:01:59,985 --> 00:02:06,348
and the core learning team, which aims to ensure that we're teaching that content to our learners without lowering engagement.

31
00:02:07,069 --> 00:02:13,272
These teams are constantly having to think about how to teach foreign languages to people without driving users away.

32
00:02:14,953 --> 00:02:19,715
So you might be wondering, what's an education app like Dolingo doing at a place like GDC?

33
00:02:20,615 --> 00:02:21,996
Well, it's simple, really.

34
00:02:22,483 --> 00:02:24,664
We want games, I mean games are fun.

35
00:02:25,064 --> 00:02:26,705
We wanted learning a language to be fun.

36
00:02:26,965 --> 00:02:29,547
So naturally we wanted Duolingo to feel like a game.

37
00:02:30,307 --> 00:02:33,008
When we talk about product, when we talk about design,

38
00:02:33,028 --> 00:02:36,230
about monetization, we talk about games,

39
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:38,591
not other education apps at Duolingo.

40
00:02:39,512 --> 00:02:41,713
Many of the mechanics you see in the Duolingo app

41
00:02:41,933 --> 00:02:44,034
were inspired by games that you've created.

42
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:47,536
But the main reason we're here is that the challenges

43
00:02:47,596 --> 00:02:50,978
we face are very similar to that of any mobile game.

44
00:02:51,707 --> 00:02:55,429
We all live in a world of really engaging apps and activities

45
00:02:55,549 --> 00:02:57,130
that all compete for our time.

46
00:02:58,611 --> 00:03:00,792
As creators of a mobile education app,

47
00:03:01,032 --> 00:03:03,293
we had to think really carefully about how

48
00:03:03,333 --> 00:03:05,835
we can compete for users' time when

49
00:03:05,875 --> 00:03:07,876
the nature of what we do is traditionally

50
00:03:07,916 --> 00:03:12,578
thought of boring, confusing, or at best, really difficult.

51
00:03:13,259 --> 00:03:14,900
We try to teach foreign languages,

52
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:17,641
and we need to convince users that they

53
00:03:17,661 --> 00:03:19,622
should be learning instead of doing something else.

54
00:03:21,725 --> 00:03:26,228
People are not usually super motivated to work hard at something voluntarily,

55
00:03:26,568 --> 00:03:28,310
especially when they aren't forced to.

56
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,833
When there's a teacher in the classroom, they can enforce learning or

57
00:03:33,033 --> 00:03:35,095
help students get unstuck when they're stuck.

58
00:03:36,056 --> 00:03:39,298
And school is mandatory, so you are guaranteed to have students for

59
00:03:39,318 --> 00:03:43,101
a certain period of time and can employ really effective learning methods in

60
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,562
helping them learn what they needed to.

61
00:03:45,853 --> 00:03:48,874
But on an online platform where players are sacrificing

62
00:03:48,994 --> 00:03:51,195
opportunity costs of playing something else,

63
00:03:51,995 --> 00:03:54,316
you have to make sure the user is willing to get through

64
00:03:54,396 --> 00:03:54,876
on their own.

65
00:03:56,096 --> 00:03:58,317
Even within apps, there may be parts

66
00:03:58,377 --> 00:04:00,218
that you need a user to get through

67
00:04:00,238 --> 00:04:02,719
that are just less exciting or harder to get through

68
00:04:02,759 --> 00:04:03,759
than the rest of your game.

69
00:04:05,019 --> 00:04:06,940
And if it's too hard or too boring,

70
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,281
you'll likely lose that player forever.

71
00:04:11,523 --> 00:04:14,925
So the gaming industry right now is incredibly saturated,

72
00:04:15,225 --> 00:04:17,206
and it's definitely not easy to make

73
00:04:17,246 --> 00:04:19,207
a successful and appealing game that

74
00:04:19,267 --> 00:04:20,587
stands out among the crowd.

75
00:04:21,608 --> 00:04:24,309
If the rise of hyper-casual games are any indication,

76
00:04:24,769 --> 00:04:27,311
lowering the barrier to entry on games

77
00:04:27,411 --> 00:04:29,132
is becoming more and more lucrative.

78
00:04:30,192 --> 00:04:31,613
When designing an experience that

79
00:04:31,653 --> 00:04:33,694
appeals to all types of players, we

80
00:04:33,754 --> 00:04:36,295
found that we have to think along a lot of the same

81
00:04:36,335 --> 00:04:37,476
dimensions as games do.

82
00:04:38,435 --> 00:04:41,398
We have to accommodate differing rates of skill acquisition,

83
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:42,078
for example.

84
00:04:42,999 --> 00:04:44,861
Some users will be really quick to pick things up,

85
00:04:45,321 --> 00:04:46,902
and some will just need a lot more time.

86
00:04:47,022 --> 00:04:48,604
And the same goes for learning a language.

87
00:04:49,324 --> 00:04:51,506
Our games should try to be flexible in allowing

88
00:04:51,546 --> 00:04:53,407
slower players to go at their own pace.

89
00:04:55,229 --> 00:04:56,590
There's also play context.

90
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,252
Players might only have a small window of time

91
00:04:59,292 --> 00:05:01,734
to play your game, or they might be ready to play

92
00:05:01,754 --> 00:05:02,975
your game for hours on end.

93
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:12,622
If you offer something in your game that offers a satisfying experience for both short and long moments of play, it opens up when your game can be played.

94
00:05:14,503 --> 00:05:25,826
There's also prior skill transfer. If a player is already familiar with your core genre or familiar with games at all, they'll likely need less onboarding than someone who has never played a similar game before.

95
00:05:26,427 --> 00:05:30,088
And we need to make an experience that accommodates both of these types of users.

96
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:33,069
And finally, there's motivation.

97
00:05:33,974 --> 00:05:36,396
We have users learning a language for travel,

98
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:39,699
to connect with old loved ones, or in many cases,

99
00:05:39,899 --> 00:05:42,322
looking to better their socioeconomic statuses.

100
00:05:43,362 --> 00:05:45,524
We have users who also don't actually care

101
00:05:45,584 --> 00:05:46,966
about learning a language at all,

102
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:49,688
but just want to feel productive while doing something fun.

103
00:05:50,769 --> 00:05:52,471
You likely have players playing your games

104
00:05:52,531 --> 00:05:55,894
for differing reasons, whether it be to achieve mastery,

105
00:05:56,314 --> 00:05:59,217
to be social with friends, or just to unwind.

106
00:06:00,147 --> 00:06:03,390
And you'll cast a wider net if you create a good experience

107
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:05,272
for all of these types of motivations.

108
00:06:07,474 --> 00:06:10,497
So Duolingo's at GDC to share how we've tackled

109
00:06:10,537 --> 00:06:12,879
the challenge of teaching something hard

110
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:15,541
to all types of users while keeping them around.

111
00:06:16,522 --> 00:06:18,584
For the last six years, we've learned a lot

112
00:06:19,024 --> 00:06:20,786
through both successes and failures

113
00:06:21,366 --> 00:06:23,689
about what works well and what doesn't

114
00:06:23,729 --> 00:06:26,111
when it comes to teaching things to online users.

115
00:06:27,158 --> 00:06:29,679
I mean, in the end, every game has a learning curve.

116
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,541
And every game is going to benefit

117
00:06:32,581 --> 00:06:35,542
from having a learning curve that doesn't drive users away.

118
00:06:36,423 --> 00:06:38,264
Let's make sure that that learning curve

119
00:06:38,384 --> 00:06:39,564
isn't holding your game back.

120
00:06:41,405 --> 00:06:43,146
So for the next 45 minutes or so,

121
00:06:43,206 --> 00:06:44,847
we're gonna talk about how to teach stuff

122
00:06:44,887 --> 00:06:46,348
while keeping things engaging.

123
00:06:47,474 --> 00:06:51,856
First, I'm going to spend a chunk of time talking about metrics, everyone's favorite thing.

124
00:06:51,876 --> 00:06:57,357
I'll share a bunch of A-B test results with you of times that our intuition was wrong,

125
00:06:57,897 --> 00:07:04,400
while talking about how we measure things, what things we measure, and why we A-B test everything.

126
00:07:05,845 --> 00:07:09,406
Then I'll go over five principles on how to create learnable content.

127
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:13,748
We have a lot of really talented learning experts in the company that help inform product

128
00:07:13,788 --> 00:07:18,290
and engineering on how to create a good learning experience and good learning curriculum.

129
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:24,572
Then we'll dive into how to go about presenting that content in a way that drives engagement

130
00:07:24,632 --> 00:07:26,513
and is still good for learning outcomes.

131
00:07:27,985 --> 00:07:31,907
I'll share a few tricks for what we use to make the whole experience motivating.

132
00:07:32,747 --> 00:07:37,650
And then finally, we'll recap with some actionable takeaways and leave a few minutes for Q&A.

133
00:07:40,412 --> 00:07:44,474
So first we'll talk about metrics, which is likely something all of you have a lot of

134
00:07:44,514 --> 00:07:45,514
familiarity with.

135
00:07:46,435 --> 00:07:50,837
This presentation will be full of metrics to demonstrate the impact that applying certain

136
00:07:50,897 --> 00:07:52,458
principles had on our numbers.

137
00:07:53,405 --> 00:07:58,707
Many of you already constantly probably look at user retention, LTV, CPI, DAUs, and all

138
00:07:58,747 --> 00:08:00,047
sorts of three-letter acronyms.

139
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:05,389
And many of you have at least heard of A-B testing, which is a core part of Duolingo.

140
00:08:06,489 --> 00:08:09,670
So really quickly, here's a quick overview of what A-B testing is.

141
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:14,892
If you want to test a new experience, you take your users, you split them into two buckets.

142
00:08:15,572 --> 00:08:19,053
On one bucket, which we call control, users get the old experience.

143
00:08:19,113 --> 00:08:21,174
They continue doing exactly what they've been doing.

144
00:08:22,126 --> 00:08:24,749
In the other bucket, they're in the experiment condition,

145
00:08:24,869 --> 00:08:26,971
and they get the new experience you're trying to test.

146
00:08:27,572 --> 00:08:29,354
You take a look at the metrics for each group

147
00:08:29,534 --> 00:08:30,715
and see which one's doing better

148
00:08:30,835 --> 00:08:32,857
to decide whether or not your new experience

149
00:08:32,897 --> 00:08:33,658
is worth launching.

150
00:08:33,678 --> 00:08:37,222
So Duolingo is obsessed with A-B testing

151
00:08:37,502 --> 00:08:38,984
every change to the product,

152
00:08:39,484 --> 00:08:41,987
and we believe it's the main reason we've kept growing.

153
00:08:42,896 --> 00:08:45,799
To date, we've run over 1,800 tests.

154
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:49,182
And through them, we've steadily and incrementally

155
00:08:49,442 --> 00:08:54,887
increased D1 retention from 13% in 2012 to 55% now.

156
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:58,751
And I've picked up a bunch of these results

157
00:08:58,811 --> 00:09:00,792
to share with you today, simply because they

158
00:09:00,833 --> 00:09:03,095
help illustrate the problems we're trying to solve.

159
00:09:04,976 --> 00:09:07,058
So here's a quick tip also for A-B testing,

160
00:09:07,118 --> 00:09:09,060
if you're already doing this on your platforms.

161
00:09:10,490 --> 00:09:14,471
Not every user is affected by an experience you're trying to test.

162
00:09:15,112 --> 00:09:19,774
For example, if the change you're testing is on level three of a dungeon, you really

163
00:09:19,814 --> 00:09:23,535
only want to take a look at the users who reach level three, not the users who are still

164
00:09:23,575 --> 00:09:26,456
on level two and not the users who are way past level three.

165
00:09:27,297 --> 00:09:31,458
Everyone else is just noise that lowers the statistical power of your A-B test.

166
00:09:32,286 --> 00:09:34,127
And if you don't have many users to start with,

167
00:09:34,368 --> 00:09:36,509
it will be really hard to run an A-B test

168
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:38,551
that gets statistical significance

169
00:09:38,751 --> 00:09:40,212
if you don't filter out this noise.

170
00:09:41,113 --> 00:09:42,975
So if you plan on A-B testing things,

171
00:09:42,995 --> 00:09:44,596
which I highly recommend,

172
00:09:45,457 --> 00:09:47,418
you could take your analytical tools further

173
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:50,821
by only measuring users that would actually be impacted

174
00:09:50,861 --> 00:09:51,622
by your change.

175
00:09:52,282 --> 00:09:54,464
To reduce noise, only count players

176
00:09:54,804 --> 00:09:56,165
who would have been exposed

177
00:09:56,365 --> 00:09:58,667
or are exposed to the changes you're testing,

178
00:09:58,767 --> 00:10:01,329
and you'll get a lot more out of your metrics that way.

179
00:10:02,259 --> 00:10:04,880
So as a disclaimer, the numbers in this presentation

180
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:07,680
are based on relative increase between control

181
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:10,381
and experiment buckets, and not absolute numbers

182
00:10:10,441 --> 00:10:11,961
unless otherwise indicated.

183
00:10:13,362 --> 00:10:15,422
Cool, so the first A-B test I'm gonna present to you

184
00:10:15,902 --> 00:10:17,703
is what I call the capitalization crutch,

185
00:10:17,763 --> 00:10:19,623
and those who use Duolingo are probably

186
00:10:19,663 --> 00:10:20,743
very familiar with this.

187
00:10:21,303 --> 00:10:22,864
So here's an exercise from Duolingo

188
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,304
with a word bank to help you out,

189
00:10:24,804 --> 00:10:27,565
and it's asking you to translate this English sentence

190
00:10:27,645 --> 00:10:29,045
into Spanish using the word bank.

191
00:10:30,035 --> 00:10:32,678
Now, can you guess what the first word

192
00:10:32,818 --> 00:10:34,099
of the right answer is?

193
00:10:35,961 --> 00:10:38,783
Yeah, you actually don't need to know any Spanish to guess.

194
00:10:38,843 --> 00:10:40,445
It's the one with the capital letter, right?

195
00:10:40,485 --> 00:10:40,905
It's VAS.

196
00:10:41,826 --> 00:10:44,589
And users said this made the exercise way too easy.

197
00:10:44,729 --> 00:10:47,251
And honestly, it was a bug that it was capitalized

198
00:10:47,291 --> 00:10:48,072
in the first place.

199
00:10:48,152 --> 00:10:52,416
So, we wanted to fix it, but since we A-B test everything,

200
00:10:52,796 --> 00:10:54,998
we tested removing that lower casing

201
00:10:55,098 --> 00:10:56,099
instead of just doing it.

202
00:10:56,529 --> 00:10:59,311
So now VAS is not capitalized in experiment condition.

203
00:11:00,032 --> 00:11:01,893
And we were hopeful that this would be fine

204
00:11:01,973 --> 00:11:03,995
and we don't want to give away the first word anymore.

205
00:11:05,436 --> 00:11:07,838
So this test actually revealed an absolute

206
00:11:08,118 --> 00:11:11,641
D1 retention drop of .5% when we did this.

207
00:11:12,482 --> 00:11:14,843
So unfortunately, to this day,

208
00:11:14,883 --> 00:11:17,766
we still capitalize the first word in these word banks

209
00:11:17,866 --> 00:11:20,087
until we can figure out something that works better.

210
00:11:21,116 --> 00:11:27,078
The lesson learned here is that even the tiniest change in difficulty can have really large

211
00:11:27,118 --> 00:11:29,319
and significant consequences on retention.

212
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:34,741
This is a problem because learning a language well and efficiently is pretty hard.

213
00:11:35,782 --> 00:11:40,263
We knew if we made the app way too easy, people might just not learn anything at all.

214
00:11:41,515 --> 00:11:42,235
So here's another one.

215
00:11:43,016 --> 00:11:45,718
We often ask learners to translate the language

216
00:11:45,858 --> 00:11:47,820
they're learning into their native language.

217
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,041
So if I'm learning Spanish,

218
00:11:49,481 --> 00:11:51,543
I might be asked to translate a Spanish sentence

219
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:52,304
into English.

220
00:11:53,285 --> 00:11:55,467
This is a lot easier than, for example,

221
00:11:55,607 --> 00:11:57,648
trying to translate English into Spanish,

222
00:11:57,929 --> 00:11:59,270
because I wouldn't have to come up

223
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,611
with the Spanish words myself,

224
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,793
I just need to recognize those words

225
00:12:02,853 --> 00:12:04,134
and know what they mean in English.

226
00:12:05,134 --> 00:12:09,000
However, it's a lot less useful for me when I'm trying to have a conversation in Spanish

227
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:12,706
and I don't get to practice creating the language I'm learning enough.

228
00:12:13,587 --> 00:12:18,515
So learners asked us to give them more translations into the languages they're learning because

229
00:12:18,575 --> 00:12:19,617
it would let them practice more.

230
00:12:20,513 --> 00:12:24,094
This was a top request on our user run forum and app reviews, et cetera.

231
00:12:24,134 --> 00:12:25,635
And we thought it was a really great idea.

232
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:32,337
So we ran a test just flipping one out of about every 20 exercises to the harder translation

233
00:12:32,397 --> 00:12:34,838
type, translating from one direction to the other.

234
00:12:35,778 --> 00:12:41,521
And on iOS, this test yielded a decrease of 1.5 daily active users when we did this.

235
00:12:42,221 --> 00:12:45,522
One out of 20 challenges was enough to have these results.

236
00:12:47,459 --> 00:12:49,441
So this goes along with the earlier lesson

237
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,143
that by making things harder, it's probably

238
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:53,744
bad for DAUs and retention.

239
00:12:54,344 --> 00:12:56,786
But what was harder to swallow about this test

240
00:12:56,906 --> 00:12:58,807
was that what the community asked for

241
00:12:58,827 --> 00:13:02,730
and what their behavior showed wasn't always aligned.

242
00:13:03,531 --> 00:13:05,993
We encounter this frequently after this experiment

243
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,954
as well on other experiments we've run.

244
00:13:09,453 --> 00:13:11,974
It's always important to listen to your players,

245
00:13:12,614 --> 00:13:15,075
but it's also good to remember that certain channels

246
00:13:15,135 --> 00:13:16,636
like the forum or app reviews

247
00:13:16,836 --> 00:13:18,716
might skew towards vocal minorities.

248
00:13:19,437 --> 00:13:21,737
Players have a tendency to propose solutions

249
00:13:21,817 --> 00:13:24,078
that they think will solve an underlying problem,

250
00:13:24,598 --> 00:13:26,139
but might end up hurting instead.

251
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,560
So try to find the problem

252
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:30,980
instead of taking a solution at face value,

253
00:13:31,441 --> 00:13:33,861
and don't feel pressured to implement the solutions

254
00:13:33,961 --> 00:13:36,402
your users demand if there might be a better one.

255
00:13:37,337 --> 00:13:40,300
Users will often speak through their behavior as well as words.

256
00:13:43,242 --> 00:13:47,345
So far we've seen that making things harder, even in an effort to teach things better,

257
00:13:48,125 --> 00:13:51,988
often leads to hits in engagement metrics like DAUs and retention.

258
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:54,940
But what about just encouraging users

259
00:13:54,980 --> 00:13:56,741
to do a little bit more, right?

260
00:13:56,781 --> 00:13:58,061
If you do more in the app,

261
00:13:58,101 --> 00:13:59,242
you're gonna learn more language

262
00:13:59,302 --> 00:14:00,202
and it's gonna be awesome.

263
00:14:00,982 --> 00:14:03,043
So in an effort to let our users pick their goals,

264
00:14:03,463 --> 00:14:07,024
we offer different tiers based on predicted time per day

265
00:14:07,405 --> 00:14:08,825
we want you to spend on Duolingo.

266
00:14:09,705 --> 00:14:11,246
More casual learners could commit

267
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:13,467
to just doing Duolingo for five minutes a day,

268
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:15,207
whereas more serious learners

269
00:14:15,247 --> 00:14:16,448
could strive for 20 minutes a day.

270
00:14:17,656 --> 00:14:19,656
However, what we found was interesting,

271
00:14:20,837 --> 00:14:22,897
using the casual goal as a baseline,

272
00:14:23,897 --> 00:14:27,638
is D14 retention for all other goals were just way worse.

273
00:14:28,518 --> 00:14:30,438
Learners who chose the most aggressive goal

274
00:14:30,778 --> 00:14:33,699
had 23% lower retention than learners

275
00:14:33,739 --> 00:14:35,339
who chose the most casual one.

276
00:14:36,879 --> 00:14:39,040
Now, of course, a lot of factors could account for this.

277
00:14:39,280 --> 00:14:41,820
It's likely that some of it has to do with our platform

278
00:14:42,140 --> 00:14:43,641
being better for casual learners

279
00:14:43,681 --> 00:14:45,361
than for more advanced learners at the time.

280
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:48,236
But other experiments have also shown us

281
00:14:48,296 --> 00:14:50,458
that when learners try to do too much at once,

282
00:14:50,838 --> 00:14:52,400
they quickly burn out and leave.

283
00:14:55,343 --> 00:14:57,905
So teaching harder stuff doesn't seem successful.

284
00:14:58,606 --> 00:14:59,887
And asking them to do a lot

285
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,029
also seems to do poorly sometimes.

286
00:15:02,790 --> 00:15:04,331
So what things actually help?

287
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:07,326
This is one of my favorite experiments.

288
00:15:07,426 --> 00:15:09,407
This happened the first year I was at Duolingo,

289
00:15:09,447 --> 00:15:11,607
hence the retro art style here.

290
00:15:12,607 --> 00:15:15,928
On Duolingo, we present little bite-sized chunks

291
00:15:15,988 --> 00:15:18,029
of knowledge in the form of what we call lessons.

292
00:15:18,989 --> 00:15:20,669
And several lessons make up one skill.

293
00:15:20,769 --> 00:15:23,110
So here you see a skill with four lessons.

294
00:15:23,690 --> 00:15:25,310
If you finish all the lessons in the skill,

295
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:27,491
you got this trophy icon to light up at the end.

296
00:15:29,351 --> 00:15:30,671
So in one of our courses,

297
00:15:30,711 --> 00:15:34,292
we accidentally added another lesson as part of an A-B test.

298
00:15:35,171 --> 00:15:36,672
Nothing else changed on this page.

299
00:15:36,712 --> 00:15:38,694
There was just an extra box there.

300
00:15:39,995 --> 00:15:43,017
However, oddly, this increased click rate

301
00:15:43,217 --> 00:15:44,678
on the very first lesson by 3%.

302
00:15:46,139 --> 00:15:47,961
Extremely significant result.

303
00:15:48,701 --> 00:15:50,923
And just to emphasize how weird this was,

304
00:15:50,943 --> 00:15:53,365
that means when a user got to this page

305
00:15:53,425 --> 00:15:55,166
before they clicked on anything,

306
00:15:56,267 --> 00:15:58,228
3% more users clicked on that first lesson

307
00:15:58,689 --> 00:15:59,989
than in the control condition,

308
00:16:00,430 --> 00:16:02,491
just because we don't even know.

309
00:16:03,245 --> 00:16:06,487
This could have been because the trophy is now closer to it.

310
00:16:06,507 --> 00:16:10,589
Maybe they misread it and thought they'd get the trophy if they did less than one.

311
00:16:11,110 --> 00:16:12,451
We still aren't sure.

312
00:16:13,111 --> 00:16:18,094
But what this did tell us is that the weirdest things help sometimes.

313
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:23,738
And we learned early on that user behavior is just really hard to predict without observation.

314
00:16:23,758 --> 00:16:29,482
And that's why user testing and A-B testing are so vital to what we do day to day.

315
00:16:31,111 --> 00:16:31,751
All right, one more.

316
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,853
So in the spirit of tests that didn't make sense to us,

317
00:16:34,953 --> 00:16:36,534
I want to share one more experiment.

318
00:16:37,634 --> 00:16:40,936
For the first time, we decided to allow users

319
00:16:41,056 --> 00:16:43,558
to opt in to a change we were making

320
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:45,679
to the inner case that we call crown levels,

321
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:47,080
which I'll talk about a little later.

322
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:49,381
We have this cute little modal that pops up

323
00:16:49,441 --> 00:16:51,522
and asks you, hey, do you want to update now

324
00:16:51,562 --> 00:16:52,703
and try out this new experiment?

325
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,362
Because of our A-B testing culture,

326
00:16:55,402 --> 00:16:57,243
which our users quickly picked up on,

327
00:16:57,884 --> 00:16:59,405
users in the past had complained

328
00:16:59,565 --> 00:17:01,346
about not being offered a choice

329
00:17:01,407 --> 00:17:03,128
whenever we changed major things.

330
00:17:03,869 --> 00:17:05,370
So we tried offering them a choice,

331
00:17:06,331 --> 00:17:07,792
of course, as an A-B test.

332
00:17:09,393 --> 00:17:10,654
The results were pretty good.

333
00:17:11,154 --> 00:17:13,416
Though we had no gains in DA user retention,

334
00:17:13,676 --> 00:17:16,999
sessions were up by 14% for users who had a choice

335
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,241
between updating to the new experience and not.

336
00:17:20,842 --> 00:17:21,163
However,

337
00:17:21,914 --> 00:17:26,037
When we looked at the branch of the experiment that didn't give users a choice and just forced

338
00:17:26,077 --> 00:17:29,700
them into the condition, the metrics were actually way better.

339
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:34,983
We believe that it might have been a combination of the new experience actually just being

340
00:17:35,023 --> 00:17:41,208
much better, but also suspect that sometimes choice might cause regret or delay acceptance.

341
00:17:42,108 --> 00:17:47,032
We had spent so much effort on this opt-in experience, but it turned out to actually

342
00:17:47,132 --> 00:17:48,193
not be helpful at all.

343
00:17:49,477 --> 00:17:53,499
You could see that the D1 increase is huge there

344
00:17:53,579 --> 00:17:54,319
in that condition.

345
00:17:54,339 --> 00:17:58,120
So what all of these experiments tell us

346
00:17:58,660 --> 00:18:01,481
is that what's intuitive isn't necessarily right

347
00:18:01,501 --> 00:18:04,842
all the time, and metrics really help us keep accountable

348
00:18:05,063 --> 00:18:08,124
by telling us whether user behavior actually agrees

349
00:18:08,184 --> 00:18:09,904
when we make intuitive changes.

350
00:18:10,884 --> 00:18:13,345
When it comes to making learning things in your game better,

351
00:18:14,086 --> 00:18:17,267
you have to really question if what you think helps

352
00:18:17,747 --> 00:18:18,547
actually helps.

353
00:18:20,693 --> 00:18:23,475
So to do this, you need to measure the right things as well.

354
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:26,617
You'll gain a lot of insight by measuring

355
00:18:26,877 --> 00:18:28,778
everything you can within reason.

356
00:18:29,639 --> 00:18:31,840
For example, we're able to identify lessons

357
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:33,942
that are particularly hard on Duolingo

358
00:18:34,062 --> 00:18:35,923
and try to fix them because we measure things

359
00:18:35,963 --> 00:18:39,245
like time taken, quit rates, exercise failure rates,

360
00:18:39,445 --> 00:18:40,866
everything we can possibly measure

361
00:18:40,986 --> 00:18:43,408
about how users are doing their lessons.

362
00:18:44,549 --> 00:18:46,630
We're able to fix things on a very precise level

363
00:18:46,710 --> 00:18:48,231
and target what we need to improve.

364
00:18:49,363 --> 00:18:54,227
For onboarding or tutorials, it'll be critical to see the funnel of how many players drop

365
00:18:54,387 --> 00:18:55,587
off along each step.

366
00:18:56,388 --> 00:18:59,710
Maybe there's a step in there that everyone is getting hung up on that you could make

367
00:18:59,770 --> 00:19:00,010
better.

368
00:19:01,671 --> 00:19:05,754
Also, regularly question which metrics should be used to make decisions.

369
00:19:06,695 --> 00:19:10,397
Sometimes it's really easy to cheat the metrics so they go in your favor.

370
00:19:11,365 --> 00:19:15,809
For example, if we wanted to maximize how many lessons

371
00:19:15,849 --> 00:19:18,191
get done on Duolingo, all we have to do

372
00:19:18,251 --> 00:19:19,992
is make the lessons way shorter, right?

373
00:19:20,833 --> 00:19:22,174
The number would go up drastically.

374
00:19:23,435 --> 00:19:25,676
When investigating the success of onboarding

375
00:19:25,716 --> 00:19:26,977
or a tutorial in your game,

376
00:19:27,618 --> 00:19:29,740
don't just look at how many players got through it.

377
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,801
You also have to make sure

378
00:19:32,101 --> 00:19:34,023
that they actually gained the information

379
00:19:34,063 --> 00:19:36,165
you were trying to deliver in that experience.

380
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:39,727
If you want to make sure your learning experience

381
00:19:39,907 --> 00:19:41,789
is both effective and engaging,

382
00:19:42,249 --> 00:19:44,551
you have to be able to measure both things.

383
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,076
So the bottom line is measure results, not just activity.

384
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,538
It's great if you run a test

385
00:19:52,578 --> 00:19:54,339
that increases onboarding completion,

386
00:19:54,359 --> 00:19:57,482
and maybe you removed a step to do it,

387
00:19:58,402 --> 00:20:01,325
but it's likely that users actually might understand less

388
00:20:01,405 --> 00:20:03,706
because they no longer have that step that you removed.

389
00:20:05,169 --> 00:20:07,270
At Duolingo, we try to hold ourselves accountable

390
00:20:07,350 --> 00:20:09,712
by measuring learning and not just completion.

391
00:20:10,732 --> 00:20:13,053
Recently, we created exercises aligned

392
00:20:13,093 --> 00:20:15,495
to the CEFR language standard,

393
00:20:15,895 --> 00:20:18,196
which is a standard language level framework.

394
00:20:19,097 --> 00:20:21,638
The questions that we created are independent

395
00:20:21,698 --> 00:20:23,399
of our own content curriculum.

396
00:20:24,140 --> 00:20:26,141
And we designed an experience called the learning quiz,

397
00:20:26,201 --> 00:20:28,522
which looks like a normal experience in Duolingo,

398
00:20:28,582 --> 00:20:30,223
but is actually there to measure

399
00:20:30,303 --> 00:20:32,084
how well our users are learning.

400
00:20:33,077 --> 00:20:35,759
It helped to tell us not just if we were successful

401
00:20:35,839 --> 00:20:37,600
in teaching the things we wanted to teach,

402
00:20:38,140 --> 00:20:40,342
but even if we were teaching the right things at all.

403
00:20:41,202 --> 00:20:42,823
We can detect if we're really bad

404
00:20:42,863 --> 00:20:44,024
at teaching certain grammar

405
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:46,025
or have holes in vocabulary we're teaching

406
00:20:46,165 --> 00:20:47,206
because of this standard.

407
00:20:48,367 --> 00:20:50,508
For games, you'll probably need to create

408
00:20:50,548 --> 00:20:51,869
your own internal measurements

409
00:20:52,089 --> 00:20:53,350
of whether or not your users

410
00:20:53,390 --> 00:20:54,690
are picking up the right things.

411
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:57,412
Try to bake in learning indicators

412
00:20:57,712 --> 00:20:59,513
to see if they learned what they need to.

413
00:21:01,570 --> 00:21:02,811
All right, so metrics are important.

414
00:21:03,171 --> 00:21:05,674
Let's assume you have a good analytics framework

415
00:21:06,014 --> 00:21:07,976
to detect where improvements can be made

416
00:21:08,177 --> 00:21:10,018
and you can keep yourself accountable for it.

417
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,283
The first step of making hard things easy to learn

418
00:21:14,783 --> 00:21:16,966
is to make the content itself more learnable.

419
00:21:17,426 --> 00:21:19,969
We'll go over five principles that we apply at Duolingo

420
00:21:20,049 --> 00:21:22,071
based on insights from our learning experts.

421
00:21:24,037 --> 00:21:27,439
So the first one is to quickly deliver satisfaction.

422
00:21:28,239 --> 00:21:30,961
And what I mean by this is to teach something

423
00:21:31,121 --> 00:21:33,183
immediately satisfying first.

424
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:37,566
It's important for us that within a user's

425
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:39,307
first few minutes on Duolingo,

426
00:21:39,967 --> 00:21:42,269
they'll learn a full functional sentence

427
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:43,830
in the language they want to learn.

428
00:21:44,690 --> 00:21:47,132
We don't start by asking users to memorize

429
00:21:47,172 --> 00:21:49,294
vocab flashcards or read grammar notes

430
00:21:49,614 --> 00:21:51,095
with the promise of eventually

431
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,656
being able to use the language.

432
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,842
we make sure they learn the language immediately.

433
00:21:56,863 --> 00:21:58,804
We want to give them the satisfaction to say,

434
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:02,347
I can do this now, and it didn't even take that much effort.

435
00:22:03,428 --> 00:22:07,551
So find a small but complete and satisfying piece

436
00:22:07,591 --> 00:22:10,673
of your gameplay, and make players gain that experience

437
00:22:10,813 --> 00:22:12,094
as early as possible.

438
00:22:13,015 --> 00:22:14,996
You probably already do this to an extent.

439
00:22:15,016 --> 00:22:17,238
I mean, I don't know any non-tabletop game

440
00:22:17,278 --> 00:22:19,799
that requires you to learn all of the rules and mechanics

441
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,581
right away before you can do anything.

442
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,661
But it's likely that there are some things that you can still

443
00:22:25,701 --> 00:22:28,662
put off teaching until a little later just to deliver a fun

444
00:22:28,702 --> 00:22:30,322
experience a little faster.

445
00:22:31,423 --> 00:22:35,704
You only get a small window to prove to your users that

446
00:22:35,744 --> 00:22:38,985
their time spent will be fruitful and satisfying and

447
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:42,226
fun, and if they can't be convinced of this in the first

448
00:22:42,366 --> 00:22:45,147
few minutes, they might leave and never come back.

449
00:22:48,091 --> 00:22:52,576
Number two on how to produce learnable content is to remember that though instruction is

450
00:22:52,696 --> 00:22:56,160
useful at times, it does not replace practice.

451
00:22:57,722 --> 00:23:03,228
If you want really efficient learning, often it's tempting to give very detailed instructions,

452
00:23:03,328 --> 00:23:04,830
especially when it comes to grammar.

453
00:23:05,451 --> 00:23:09,595
So here's an example from our Klingon course, and yes, we have Klingon on Duolingo.

454
00:23:11,294 --> 00:23:13,717
Here's a paragraph describing the grammar

455
00:23:13,857 --> 00:23:16,099
of verb prefixes in the third person.

456
00:23:16,920 --> 00:23:18,922
It says if the subject is third person,

457
00:23:18,942 --> 00:23:22,946
he, she, it, they, and has either no object

458
00:23:23,006 --> 00:23:25,108
or a third person object, et cetera,

459
00:23:25,629 --> 00:23:29,112
it describes in great detail when to use a prefix on verbs.

460
00:23:29,793 --> 00:23:31,975
And this is actually incredibly useful

461
00:23:32,115 --> 00:23:33,497
and many learners love this.

462
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:36,081
But there are also a lot of users

463
00:23:36,342 --> 00:23:38,523
who won't bother to read all of this text

464
00:23:39,143 --> 00:23:41,705
and wouldn't understand it even if they did manage

465
00:23:41,745 --> 00:23:43,566
to muster up the motivation to read it.

466
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:47,989
What we lean on instead is providing a lot of practice

467
00:23:48,189 --> 00:23:51,371
for a topic at hand as a learner does exercises in our app

468
00:23:51,812 --> 00:23:53,513
with the goal of leading a learner

469
00:23:53,573 --> 00:23:55,354
to form their own generalizations.

470
00:23:55,894 --> 00:23:57,795
So I'm about to try to pronounce Klingon,

471
00:23:57,815 --> 00:23:59,537
so I hope there are no native Klingon speakers

472
00:23:59,577 --> 00:24:01,278
in the audience, because I'm going to butcher it.

473
00:24:01,438 --> 00:24:03,439
So for example, we might present the sentence,

474
00:24:04,044 --> 00:24:09,309
Yasha, Mara, I'm supposed to say Klingon very aggressively is what I'm told so that's what I'll do.

475
00:24:10,470 --> 00:24:18,957
It means does Mara understand. But Mara, Raj, yeah, means Mara, do you understand?

476
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:26,483
Here you can start to suspect what adding bl to the verb does here. Here are two more examples.

477
00:24:27,845 --> 00:24:31,548
Yasha, Tor, does Tor understand?

478
00:24:33,010 --> 00:24:35,412
And then torg, blah, yah.

479
00:24:36,573 --> 00:24:38,255
Torg, do you understand?

480
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:41,798
So now just based on these four examples,

481
00:24:42,318 --> 00:24:46,001
you can probably infer that the BL is needed on a verb

482
00:24:46,061 --> 00:24:47,943
when talking directly to the person,

483
00:24:48,243 --> 00:24:50,004
but not when talking about them.

484
00:24:50,885 --> 00:24:52,566
By having tons of practice,

485
00:24:53,287 --> 00:24:56,550
learners not only have a less intimidating experience,

486
00:24:57,130 --> 00:24:59,292
but also start to learn things implicitly

487
00:24:59,472 --> 00:25:01,494
and create their own rules for how things work.

488
00:25:02,473 --> 00:25:07,636
The brain is an amazing thing, and it can learn complex things really intuitively.

489
00:25:08,537 --> 00:25:13,821
In fact, it's actually better for long-term retention of knowledge to learn implicitly

490
00:25:14,061 --> 00:25:15,342
rather than explicitly.

491
00:25:15,362 --> 00:25:20,545
The best thing to do is provide enough exposure to encourage this type of learning.

492
00:25:22,544 --> 00:25:27,448
So in Breath of the Wild, I thought the game did an excellent job at giving really lightweight

493
00:25:27,508 --> 00:25:29,630
instruction and tutorials for battling.

494
00:25:30,190 --> 00:25:34,974
They presented new mechanics and fun ways, and shrines you needed to complete to progress.

495
00:25:35,755 --> 00:25:37,756
One such mechanic was how to parry with your shield.

496
00:25:38,357 --> 00:25:42,501
The instructions say press A to deflect an attack with your shield right before it lands

497
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,381
for a perfect guard.

498
00:25:43,742 --> 00:25:44,222
All right, cool.

499
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:47,281
But the game didn't try to describe to you

500
00:25:47,341 --> 00:25:50,324
in excruciating detail precisely how to time it

501
00:25:50,424 --> 00:25:52,966
or when to use it or what kind of attacks you could parry.

502
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:55,448
You just need to practice to get good at it.

503
00:25:56,309 --> 00:25:58,911
And I don't remember how many times I got set on fire

504
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:01,934
trying to practice how to deflect a guardian laser,

505
00:26:02,534 --> 00:26:04,656
but that's something I just really needed

506
00:26:04,716 --> 00:26:07,739
to get a lot of practice on, even with perfect instructions.

507
00:26:08,419 --> 00:26:10,621
I learned implicitly about which animations

508
00:26:10,681 --> 00:26:12,042
lined up with the proper timing

509
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:13,424
and what things could be parried.

510
00:26:14,164 --> 00:26:16,947
And that was not only more useful, it was a lot more fun.

511
00:26:19,389 --> 00:26:22,432
So third piece of advice on creating learnable content

512
00:26:22,812 --> 00:26:26,416
is to cleverly disguise difficult or boring concepts.

513
00:26:27,557 --> 00:26:29,138
It's a well-known trick to try to pair

514
00:26:29,198 --> 00:26:31,080
less exciting things with fun things

515
00:26:31,220 --> 00:26:33,422
if you want the less exciting things to get done.

516
00:26:34,978 --> 00:26:38,321
So in the early days of Duolingo, on all of our units,

517
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:41,103
we had, well, all of our units, which we call skills,

518
00:26:41,623 --> 00:26:44,486
were named things like present tense, determiners,

519
00:26:44,926 --> 00:26:47,128
adverbs three, prepositions.

520
00:26:47,288 --> 00:26:50,370
We used to have what we call a grammar wall on Duolingo,

521
00:26:51,010 --> 00:26:53,132
a group of skills that explicitly tried

522
00:26:53,172 --> 00:26:54,593
to teach you difficult grammar.

523
00:26:55,133 --> 00:26:57,976
And we found that many users dropped off at this point

524
00:26:58,076 --> 00:26:59,196
once they hit this grammar wall.

525
00:27:00,510 --> 00:27:02,473
Now, in newer versions of our curriculum,

526
00:27:02,934 --> 00:27:05,777
we sprinkle that grammar into skills like recreation,

527
00:27:06,017 --> 00:27:07,199
restaurant, travel.

528
00:27:07,980 --> 00:27:10,724
We use a theme like recreation to teach you verbs

529
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:12,446
like run, swim, and play.

530
00:27:12,606 --> 00:27:14,288
And it's a clever way that we can teach you

531
00:27:14,348 --> 00:27:15,550
how to use the present tense

532
00:27:15,990 --> 00:27:18,253
when you're just learning about how to describe your hobbies

533
00:27:18,293 --> 00:27:19,154
and what you like to do.

534
00:27:20,302 --> 00:27:24,543
We can disguise a grammatical concept like how to ask questions in a skill about how

535
00:27:24,563 --> 00:27:25,723
to ask for directions.

536
00:27:26,424 --> 00:27:30,765
The learner thinks that they're learning about travel skills and having fun doing it, but

537
00:27:30,785 --> 00:27:33,206
what they're really learning is how questions are asked.

538
00:27:34,566 --> 00:27:40,688
In the context of games, you can make particularly challenging things into competitions or events.

539
00:27:41,388 --> 00:27:45,430
You can try to bake more mundane but useful things, like how to set certain settings,

540
00:27:45,910 --> 00:27:47,370
into the game progression itself.

541
00:27:48,398 --> 00:27:50,680
The opportunities are boundless, but your users

542
00:27:50,700 --> 00:27:52,641
are going to have a lot more fun if they

543
00:27:52,701 --> 00:27:54,582
feel like they're working towards something

544
00:27:54,602 --> 00:27:55,282
that they want to.

545
00:27:55,302 --> 00:28:00,685
Advice number four when it comes to making content learnable

546
00:28:00,805 --> 00:28:03,746
is to offer a lot of exposure of that content

547
00:28:03,866 --> 00:28:05,247
in different contexts.

548
00:28:06,748 --> 00:28:09,269
On Duolingo, we have a lot of exercise types

549
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:12,691
to add variety to the experience and also present

550
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:14,071
many ways to learn something.

551
00:28:14,790 --> 00:28:19,893
So at one point, you might be asked to select a picture of a fish, then recall how to say fish,

552
00:28:20,113 --> 00:28:25,257
and then translate, I have a pet fish, all in the same lesson. You know, there are many different

553
00:28:25,477 --> 00:28:29,539
ways that you can practice the word fish, and by the end of it, we want learners to be very

554
00:28:29,619 --> 00:28:34,623
comfortable with it. Going back to the shield pair example from Breath of the Wild, I learned

555
00:28:34,643 --> 00:28:39,466
what was the same and what was different between pairing a Lynel, a Moblin, or a Guardian.

556
00:28:40,046 --> 00:28:41,367
Change up the environment.

557
00:28:41,828 --> 00:28:45,729
and allow users to apply what they know to new situations.

558
00:28:46,429 --> 00:28:48,549
You see examples of this in games everywhere,

559
00:28:48,729 --> 00:28:51,550
like having different stages and items in Smash Ultimate,

560
00:28:51,950 --> 00:28:54,571
or using the same items across many different champions

561
00:28:54,651 --> 00:28:55,491
on League of Legends.

562
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:00,252
This will allow users to create correct generalizations

563
00:29:00,912 --> 00:29:01,932
about what they've learned

564
00:29:02,032 --> 00:29:03,993
and how it applies in new situations.

565
00:29:04,773 --> 00:29:06,793
It's also really exhilarating to discover

566
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,674
you already know how to do something in a new situation.

567
00:29:10,777 --> 00:29:13,817
and exposure in different contexts is key

568
00:29:13,937 --> 00:29:15,718
in solidifying cognitive learning.

569
00:29:18,259 --> 00:29:20,719
And finally, making things memorable

570
00:29:20,999 --> 00:29:22,680
also makes them more learnable.

571
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:26,701
This seems super obvious, but it's easy to forget

572
00:29:26,781 --> 00:29:28,241
to be intentional about it.

573
00:29:29,941 --> 00:29:31,382
So we actually have a Twitter account

574
00:29:31,642 --> 00:29:34,643
dedicated to really weird sentences found on Duolingo,

575
00:29:35,343 --> 00:29:36,923
and some examples include,

576
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:40,044
there are 1,500 cat photos in my cell phone.

577
00:29:41,855 --> 00:29:43,536
Where can we hide the bodies?

578
00:29:46,156 --> 00:29:47,597
And you do not exist.

579
00:29:49,077 --> 00:29:52,578
These are real screenshots from real users.

580
00:29:53,138 --> 00:29:55,099
And actually, some users criticize

581
00:29:55,119 --> 00:29:57,119
that these are not pragmatic and useful.

582
00:29:57,159 --> 00:30:00,080
You wouldn't normally say these things when traveling, et

583
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:00,500
cetera.

584
00:30:01,040 --> 00:30:02,881
But they actually serve a real purpose.

585
00:30:03,721 --> 00:30:06,021
For one, going against expectation

586
00:30:06,281 --> 00:30:08,622
makes things more salient or noticeable.

587
00:30:09,558 --> 00:30:12,639
You have to think about what the sentence really means.

588
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:15,740
Maybe second guess yourself, did they actually say that?

589
00:30:16,740 --> 00:30:20,121
Instead of making assumptions, in your games,

590
00:30:20,521 --> 00:30:23,502
find times to make things you want the user to learn

591
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:27,063
surprising, funny, or emotional in some way.

592
00:30:28,063 --> 00:30:29,463
But just a quick word of warning,

593
00:30:29,823 --> 00:30:32,924
for users, doing something wrong is also memorable.

594
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:35,805
We all know the saying, learn from your mistakes,

595
00:30:35,925 --> 00:30:38,886
because mistakes are really easy to remember and learn from.

596
00:30:39,933 --> 00:30:42,475
But make sure it's not a negative experience

597
00:30:42,695 --> 00:30:44,556
if you plan to rely on this for learning.

598
00:30:45,277 --> 00:30:48,179
If you plan to lead the user to do something incorrect,

599
00:30:48,219 --> 00:30:50,721
to teach them something, provide an environment

600
00:30:50,801 --> 00:30:52,842
where the user isn't afraid to make mistakes,

601
00:30:53,383 --> 00:30:55,064
or it could be really frustrating.

602
00:30:55,084 --> 00:31:00,448
All right, so now that we have learnable content,

603
00:31:00,668 --> 00:31:03,330
there needs to be a good framework to present that content.

604
00:31:04,271 --> 00:31:05,812
So the framework we'll talk about today

605
00:31:05,932 --> 00:31:07,333
is difficulty scaffolding.

606
00:31:08,495 --> 00:31:11,296
On Duolingo, it used to be that once you finished

607
00:31:11,336 --> 00:31:14,398
a unit of learning called a skill, it was just done.

608
00:31:14,798 --> 00:31:16,819
It would turn gold, and then over time,

609
00:31:16,859 --> 00:31:19,020
it would fade away to remind you to practice it.

610
00:31:19,420 --> 00:31:21,521
But once you were done, you had finished that skill.

611
00:31:23,322 --> 00:31:25,623
About a year ago, we changed the experience

612
00:31:25,703 --> 00:31:27,624
to something that we called crown levels.

613
00:31:28,624 --> 00:31:31,066
It made it so that there were now five levels

614
00:31:31,306 --> 00:31:33,407
on every skill instead of just one.

615
00:31:34,327 --> 00:31:36,708
For each level you gained, you earned a shiny crown.

616
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:42,924
And we gradually increased the difficulty of exercises you got as you leveled up a skill.

617
00:31:43,705 --> 00:31:48,131
You could then choose whether you wanted to level up a skill you had already learned or

618
00:31:48,171 --> 00:31:49,793
move on to learn new content.

619
00:31:51,095 --> 00:31:55,020
This feature was critical to us for improving learning.

620
00:31:55,910 --> 00:32:01,434
It provided a clever way to gate harder material for those who were serious enough to level up.

621
00:32:02,075 --> 00:32:09,820
And we could finally inject harder and more effective learning material without killing engagement by just putting it at higher skill levels.

622
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,882
This allowed users to self-select.

623
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:23,769
It satisfied both casual learners who wanted cursory knowledge of the language to very serious learners who wanted to master everything and practice as much as they could.

624
00:32:25,624 --> 00:32:32,290
So, Crown Levels is probably our biggest experience redesign ever and one of our most successful.

625
00:32:33,591 --> 00:32:40,156
For new users, we saw an increase 5% in DA use, 7% in sessions completed.

626
00:32:40,897 --> 00:32:43,759
We also got a 2% increase in D1 retention, 4% in D7, and 6% in D14 retention.

627
00:32:49,536 --> 00:32:51,557
Now, if you wonder what I mean by new users,

628
00:32:51,677 --> 00:32:55,178
we almost always run both new user and existing user

629
00:32:55,239 --> 00:32:58,280
experiments for every significant change.

630
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:01,601
New user experiments are for users created

631
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,222
after a certain point in time.

632
00:33:04,002 --> 00:33:06,243
We decide what experience they'll get before they even

633
00:33:06,283 --> 00:33:07,024
start Duolingo.

634
00:33:07,084 --> 00:33:08,765
So they start with that experience

635
00:33:08,925 --> 00:33:10,165
and have a consistent one.

636
00:33:10,645 --> 00:33:13,046
This removes novelty effect of certain features.

637
00:33:14,382 --> 00:33:24,514
On the other hand, existing user experiments or old user experiments test the effect of giving the new experience to users who have already seen the old experience and changed to the new one.

638
00:33:24,875 --> 00:33:26,597
It would include novelty effect.

639
00:33:27,910 --> 00:33:31,191
We saw huge gains in the old user experience as well.

640
00:33:32,031 --> 00:33:36,753
Sessions increased by 23%, likely due to novelty effect.

641
00:33:37,474 --> 00:33:40,335
But D1 and D7 both also increased by three and 4%

642
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:41,916
respectively.

643
00:33:42,736 --> 00:33:44,557
We don't have D14 retention numbers

644
00:33:44,597 --> 00:33:46,558
because we launched this experience to users

645
00:33:46,598 --> 00:33:47,578
before we could get them,

646
00:33:47,858 --> 00:33:49,579
since we didn't want to wait any longer.

647
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,000
The metrics were just too good.

648
00:33:52,392 --> 00:33:58,338
For both new and old users, the experiment was a huge win for both engagement and for learning.

649
00:33:59,199 --> 00:34:04,404
Learners were gradually exposed to harder exercise types as their account age increased,

650
00:34:05,285 --> 00:34:10,371
and we were able to expose many more learners to harder, effective exercises overall,

651
00:34:10,791 --> 00:34:12,553
and only when they were ready for them.

652
00:34:14,535 --> 00:34:16,796
So the lesson here and our advice to games

653
00:34:17,356 --> 00:34:19,597
is to find ways to scaffold difficulty.

654
00:34:20,257 --> 00:34:22,658
It's certainly helped our numbers tremendously.

655
00:34:23,378 --> 00:34:26,059
Provide paths for both breadth and depth

656
00:34:26,619 --> 00:34:29,020
so that users can self-select into the experience

657
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,061
they want naturally.

658
00:34:31,001 --> 00:34:33,402
Let players who love a feature go deep into it.

659
00:34:33,922 --> 00:34:36,023
And let casual players stay more surface level

660
00:34:36,123 --> 00:34:36,823
until they're ready.

661
00:34:36,843 --> 00:34:39,964
You'll likely be able to convert casual players

662
00:34:40,044 --> 00:34:42,265
to higher difficulty over time if you

663
00:34:42,305 --> 00:34:43,765
can keep them for longer.

664
00:34:46,122 --> 00:34:48,724
And what's more is by having a framework like this,

665
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,525
it helps with the scalability of your game design.

666
00:34:52,406 --> 00:34:53,687
If you can create a framework

667
00:34:54,087 --> 00:34:56,408
that opens up a lot of possibilities in the future,

668
00:34:57,269 --> 00:35:00,070
it lowers the barrier of entry for new ideas

669
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,272
and lets you iterate quickly at lower risk.

670
00:35:03,252 --> 00:35:06,334
We were finally able to introduce more exercise types

671
00:35:06,374 --> 00:35:09,256
with high learning value using this new crown system

672
00:35:09,796 --> 00:35:11,097
that we've always wanted to,

673
00:35:11,737 --> 00:35:14,939
but never introduced in fear of scaring away newer users.

674
00:35:16,068 --> 00:35:18,290
Now we just introduce them at later crown levels.

675
00:35:19,570 --> 00:35:21,772
Likewise, if you have certain opportunities,

676
00:35:22,212 --> 00:35:24,674
open up at later player levels or skills.

677
00:35:25,355 --> 00:35:27,576
You can make those experiences more intense

678
00:35:27,656 --> 00:35:29,558
without fear of scaring away the newbies.

679
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:36,710
How to present learning content all boils down to balancing cognitive load,

680
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:39,831
the amount of brain effort needed at any given time.

681
00:35:40,671 --> 00:35:44,231
Too much of it is exhausting and too little of it is boring.

682
00:35:45,132 --> 00:35:48,892
Our crowns change let users self-select into how intense they wanted their

683
00:35:48,932 --> 00:35:50,213
learning experience to be.

684
00:35:52,453 --> 00:35:55,434
So now that we have a framework, we should also try to make sure we don't

685
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,394
overwhelm our users within that framework.

686
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,424
One key thing is to resist the urge to get to the good stuff right away.

687
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:05,187
Make sure that users are prepared for it first.

688
00:36:05,968 --> 00:36:09,331
The boss battle might be the most exciting thing in your game and you can't wait for

689
00:36:09,411 --> 00:36:13,636
users to get to it, but you'll set the player up for failure if you drive them to that experience

690
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:14,256
too soon.

691
00:36:15,758 --> 00:36:21,524
Also, take into account the learning curve of using your game, not just what you're trying

692
00:36:21,564 --> 00:36:21,964
to teach.

693
00:36:22,904 --> 00:36:27,348
We wanted to start by teaching really important vocab and grammar right away at Duolingo.

694
00:36:28,309 --> 00:36:33,173
But what led to much better engagement was first teaching trivially easy vocabulary.

695
00:36:33,534 --> 00:36:38,198
For example, at the beginning of the experience, we used a lot of names or other words that

696
00:36:38,238 --> 00:36:42,803
are similar between the native language and the language being learned, even if it's not

697
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:44,484
the most immediately useful.

698
00:36:45,384 --> 00:36:49,786
This allowed learners to focus first on learning how our app works in the first place,

699
00:36:50,146 --> 00:36:56,009
the types of exercises we use, using hints throughout, the lesson and the skill system, etc.,

700
00:36:56,569 --> 00:37:02,632
before also trying to learn a new language on top of that. Learning it all at once would be too much.

701
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:08,455
A lot of games do this well by having an onboarding experience that targets learning

702
00:37:08,495 --> 00:37:13,898
how things work, like the menu, without overloading the user with lore or new mechanics off the bat.

703
00:37:16,073 --> 00:37:18,496
But in an attempt to not underwhelm the user,

704
00:37:18,816 --> 00:37:21,099
you may run the risk of, I mean overwhelm the user,

705
00:37:21,159 --> 00:37:23,421
you might run the risk of underwhelming them

706
00:37:23,901 --> 00:37:25,203
with things that are too easy

707
00:37:25,263 --> 00:37:27,305
or don't take into account prior skill.

708
00:37:28,666 --> 00:37:30,748
Remember to keep the experience interesting

709
00:37:30,809 --> 00:37:32,370
for those advanced users too.

710
00:37:33,431 --> 00:37:35,974
You can get around this by trying to manage difficulty

711
00:37:36,354 --> 00:37:37,375
by user cohort.

712
00:37:38,729 --> 00:37:42,813
So for example, we track the failure rate of every exercise on Duolingo.

713
00:37:43,193 --> 00:37:47,617
Every time someone has to translate I have a dog to Spanish, we see how many learners get it right,

714
00:37:47,698 --> 00:37:52,622
how many get it wrong. And we have a threshold where we throw out exercises that are too hard.

715
00:37:53,483 --> 00:38:00,590
But we separate these based on crowd level. So users at the first level, more beginner users,

716
00:38:01,030 --> 00:38:01,350
all get

717
00:38:01,831 --> 00:38:06,817
the same threshold as other beginners, whereas more advanced users probably can handle more

718
00:38:06,877 --> 00:38:09,119
difficult sentences and get them wrong less often.

719
00:38:10,661 --> 00:38:15,667
In games, leagues and leaderboards are a prime example of this, where you're constantly in

720
00:38:15,707 --> 00:38:18,430
the same grouping as players with similar activity levels.

721
00:38:19,695 --> 00:38:22,397
You either get promoted or demoted regularly

722
00:38:22,437 --> 00:38:25,198
to stay calibrated, and ELO systems are the same way.

723
00:38:26,359 --> 00:38:28,720
Also in games like StarCraft II or in Civ VI,

724
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:30,061
you might be asked at the beginning

725
00:38:30,081 --> 00:38:32,562
to self-report your prior experience

726
00:38:33,062 --> 00:38:35,003
so that the onboarding can be accelerated

727
00:38:35,063 --> 00:38:36,984
if you're already experienced in a genre.

728
00:38:37,964 --> 00:38:40,246
Provide natural ways for your players

729
00:38:40,286 --> 00:38:42,027
to speed up their progression when needed.

730
00:38:44,822 --> 00:38:48,366
All right, the last step after having great learnable content

731
00:38:48,586 --> 00:38:50,668
and a framework to make going through that framework

732
00:38:50,708 --> 00:38:51,509
a good experience.

733
00:38:52,050 --> 00:38:53,411
Sorry, that sentence didn't grammar.

734
00:38:53,691 --> 00:38:56,414
The last step in creating a good experience

735
00:38:56,514 --> 00:38:59,357
is to design a motivating UX for that experience.

736
00:39:00,318 --> 00:39:02,260
And actually a surprisingly large part

737
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:03,982
of making an experience delightful

738
00:39:04,763 --> 00:39:07,586
is to just avoid things that are not delightful.

739
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:11,384
Which brings me to this, something that you hear

740
00:39:11,824 --> 00:39:15,005
over and over again but cannot be understated,

741
00:39:16,045 --> 00:39:17,206
don't make users read.

742
00:39:20,006 --> 00:39:22,327
Because users don't read.

743
00:39:23,467 --> 00:39:25,628
So here's an example where Duo the Owl

744
00:39:25,748 --> 00:39:27,488
helpfully pops up on the website,

745
00:39:27,708 --> 00:39:29,389
excited for your first lesson,

746
00:39:29,809 --> 00:39:31,850
and tells learners they can hover over words

747
00:39:31,910 --> 00:39:34,390
to get a hint whenever they don't know what a word means.

748
00:39:35,194 --> 00:39:41,680
We even highlight in orange new words to try to encourage people to hover over them and use these hints we provide.

749
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:44,783
And this is actually a key part of how Duolingo works.

750
00:39:45,443 --> 00:39:48,606
We don't give you upfront instruction on how language works.

751
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:53,370
We just kind of throw exercises at you and convince you that you can do it with just a little bit of help.

752
00:39:54,652 --> 00:39:59,736
So we found that fewer than 40% of our monthly active users use hints at all.

753
00:40:00,797 --> 00:40:03,218
And we have seen many user testing videos

754
00:40:03,338 --> 00:40:04,939
where learners are really confused

755
00:40:04,999 --> 00:40:07,441
about how they're supposed to know the meaning of words

756
00:40:07,481 --> 00:40:08,702
without being taught them.

757
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:11,383
Many say that they had no idea

758
00:40:11,423 --> 00:40:13,345
they could hover on or tap words.

759
00:40:14,545 --> 00:40:18,648
This single sentence was not being read by many people,

760
00:40:19,028 --> 00:40:21,390
or if it was, it was being quickly forgotten.

761
00:40:23,651 --> 00:40:26,513
Here's another example where in big red letters

762
00:40:26,633 --> 00:40:28,735
we tell learners why they got something wrong.

763
00:40:29,670 --> 00:40:33,092
Here, the learner entered in women instead of woman,

764
00:40:33,572 --> 00:40:36,213
and we point out that the singular form woman

765
00:40:36,513 --> 00:40:38,154
should have been used here instead.

766
00:40:39,375 --> 00:40:42,597
However, when looking at the forms around this exercise,

767
00:40:42,937 --> 00:40:45,238
we'll still often see learners confused

768
00:40:45,318 --> 00:40:47,159
about why their answer wasn't correct.

769
00:40:47,799 --> 00:40:50,121
This user says, I wrote women instead of woman

770
00:40:50,201 --> 00:40:51,641
and feel it should be counted correct.

771
00:40:53,345 --> 00:40:56,007
It's likely that when users see longish text,

772
00:40:56,447 --> 00:40:58,068
they continue on without reading it,

773
00:40:58,528 --> 00:40:59,909
or skim it and forget it.

774
00:41:00,749 --> 00:41:03,590
And you'll note here that these are just single sentences

775
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:05,711
that we found our users were just not reading.

776
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:09,373
So what I found helpful in the past

777
00:41:09,433 --> 00:41:11,254
is performing the utterly screwed test.

778
00:41:12,335 --> 00:41:16,477
Ask yourself, is there a way for the player to recover

779
00:41:16,617 --> 00:41:20,098
if they were suddenly plopped into your game at any point?

780
00:41:21,045 --> 00:41:23,526
Will there be anything they missed out on at the beginning

781
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,227
that would prevent them from moving on?

782
00:41:26,388 --> 00:41:29,830
If your game involves reading a one-time wall of text

783
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:32,512
at the beginning, it'll be very hard for a user

784
00:41:32,532 --> 00:41:35,173
to keep going if they come back after a hiatus.

785
00:41:36,394 --> 00:41:38,716
But if your game is intuitive to play

786
00:41:38,896 --> 00:41:43,058
without much explanation, it's much easier to get back into.

787
00:41:44,259 --> 00:41:46,660
For Duolingo, resurrected users,

788
00:41:46,821 --> 00:41:49,022
or users who come back after a long break,

789
00:41:49,742 --> 00:41:52,603
make up a large chunk of our daily active users.

790
00:41:53,463 --> 00:41:56,445
So making sure that they can get back into the experience

791
00:41:56,525 --> 00:41:58,706
without a ton of additional onboarding

792
00:41:58,906 --> 00:42:00,907
is really important for our metrics.

793
00:42:02,728 --> 00:42:03,888
Besides players not reading,

794
00:42:04,508 --> 00:42:06,809
this is also a huge reason to avoid text.

795
00:42:07,830 --> 00:42:10,251
At Duolingo, we see lots of text

796
00:42:10,311 --> 00:42:12,752
as a possible indicator of lazy design.

797
00:42:13,867 --> 00:42:16,027
Text is often a crutch for solving

798
00:42:16,127 --> 00:42:19,568
difficult instructional problems that often have a harder,

799
00:42:20,468 --> 00:42:22,509
but more user-friendly design alternative.

800
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:26,350
The more intuitive your design, the simpler your design,

801
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:27,850
the less text you'll need.

802
00:42:28,931 --> 00:42:31,571
This is largely why we didn't have explicit grammar

803
00:42:31,611 --> 00:42:33,412
instruction in the app for so long,

804
00:42:33,892 --> 00:42:36,332
why we keep all of our exercises really short,

805
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:39,753
and why we use lots of colors, icons, animations,

806
00:42:39,793 --> 00:42:42,394
and game mechanics to convey instruction instead.

807
00:42:44,093 --> 00:42:49,276
Something we've also found works well is to offer help as close to when it's needed as possible.

808
00:42:49,916 --> 00:42:55,219
For example, we provide in-lesson hints instead of asking learners to memorize all of the words ahead of time.

809
00:42:56,239 --> 00:43:01,622
Because even if you manage to have a player read the text, they're still not likely to remember it.

810
00:43:02,022 --> 00:43:05,764
So offering help at the moment that it's needed is really useful for your players.

811
00:43:08,770 --> 00:43:11,873
Second component of creating a good learning experience

812
00:43:12,613 --> 00:43:15,455
is to prevent the player from self-destructing on your game.

813
00:43:16,676 --> 00:43:19,078
If you have a game with a really steep learning curve,

814
00:43:19,178 --> 00:43:22,100
it's easy for learners to burn out or get frustrated.

815
00:43:23,862 --> 00:43:25,483
So pacing mechanics helps with this.

816
00:43:25,823 --> 00:43:26,944
It helps make sure that you aren't

817
00:43:26,964 --> 00:43:29,506
burning through or introducing your content too quickly.

818
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:35,111
On Duolingo, we introduced a controversial feature called the health mechanic in our

819
00:43:35,211 --> 00:43:38,913
iOS app, where health segments refill after a period of time.

820
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:42,915
If a user makes a mistake, they lose a health segment.

821
00:43:43,455 --> 00:43:47,277
They can re-earn this health by practicing material that they've already learned.

822
00:43:48,118 --> 00:43:52,240
And this means users naturally have to slow down if they're moving too quickly.

823
00:43:53,986 --> 00:43:58,569
However, this also led to increases in D1 and D7 retention

824
00:43:58,609 --> 00:44:02,551
when we ran this, despite a lot of outrage from our users.

825
00:44:03,472 --> 00:44:06,594
And it has the plus side of also slowing down learners

826
00:44:06,694 --> 00:44:09,416
to really try to think about and get the right answer

827
00:44:09,576 --> 00:44:12,658
on exercises and think harder about the learning aspect.

828
00:44:13,999 --> 00:44:17,161
Cramming in general is really bad for long-term learning

829
00:44:17,341 --> 00:44:20,403
and retention if you want players to learn a concept

830
00:44:20,763 --> 00:44:21,564
and grasp it well.

831
00:44:22,666 --> 00:44:25,627
Users will quickly burn out, and you'll have high user churn

832
00:44:26,207 --> 00:44:27,767
if you fail to pace them correctly.

833
00:44:28,588 --> 00:44:31,048
If you want to build a habit of your users playing

834
00:44:31,088 --> 00:44:33,909
your games every day, it's good to encourage them

835
00:44:33,949 --> 00:44:35,450
to come back later sometimes.

836
00:44:36,370 --> 00:44:38,651
Timers and pacing also give motivation

837
00:44:38,691 --> 00:44:40,991
to come back and push back against binging.

838
00:44:41,952 --> 00:44:44,552
And they give a great reason for notifications that

839
00:44:44,592 --> 00:44:45,953
also helps bring users back.

840
00:44:49,062 --> 00:44:53,645
Another form of self-destruction we saw was users getting frustrated with themselves if

841
00:44:53,665 --> 00:44:56,246
they got several exercises wrong in a row.

842
00:44:56,386 --> 00:44:57,887
We saw this in user testing.

843
00:44:58,788 --> 00:45:05,472
So this might seem really silly, but we started adding a friendly motivational message reminding

844
00:45:05,532 --> 00:45:08,434
learners that they're still learning even when they get things wrong.

845
00:45:08,874 --> 00:45:12,577
So Duo, our helpful little owl, pops up and says, even when you're wrong, you're still

846
00:45:12,617 --> 00:45:12,917
learning.

847
00:45:14,695 --> 00:45:17,536
And this led to huge engagement wins,

848
00:45:17,596 --> 00:45:19,237
just this simple tiny thing.

849
00:45:19,297 --> 00:45:22,778
So we saw nearly a 2% increase in DAUs.

850
00:45:23,518 --> 00:45:27,940
Retention increased 3% for D1, 6% for D7,

851
00:45:29,921 --> 00:45:33,262
7% for D14 retention, this little bubble message here.

852
00:45:33,983 --> 00:45:37,524
And that's an insane gain for such a simple, simple feature.

853
00:45:38,955 --> 00:45:42,338
If you have a way to detect if your player is getting frustrated,

854
00:45:42,959 --> 00:45:46,222
setting up just little ways to intervene and encourage them

855
00:45:46,382 --> 00:45:48,284
can do so much for retention.

856
00:45:51,227 --> 00:45:53,830
And finally, though it seems rather obvious,

857
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:58,454
remember to not only discourage destructive behavior,

858
00:45:58,755 --> 00:46:01,157
but to also encourage desired behavior.

859
00:46:02,833 --> 00:46:05,393
Achievements or quests are a really classic way to do this,

860
00:46:05,453 --> 00:46:07,014
and you see them in games all the time.

861
00:46:07,674 --> 00:46:09,634
When we added achievements on Duolingo,

862
00:46:09,834 --> 00:46:13,455
they gave us wins in DAUs, sessions completed, and retention.

863
00:46:14,456 --> 00:46:17,756
But one of their main benefits is also providing clever ways

864
00:46:18,116 --> 00:46:20,877
to increase discovery behavior in your game.

865
00:46:21,877 --> 00:46:24,198
For Duolingo, some fewer used features,

866
00:46:24,258 --> 00:46:27,058
like looking at your profile tab or adding friends,

867
00:46:27,498 --> 00:46:30,639
doubled in engagement over 100 percent increase in clicks

868
00:46:31,199 --> 00:46:32,540
with the addition of achievements.

869
00:46:35,145 --> 00:46:40,007
And finally, if we're talking about one of our best performing mechanisms for motivation,

870
00:46:40,027 --> 00:46:42,108
it's definitely the streak.

871
00:46:43,449 --> 00:46:47,691
The streak is how many days in a row you've met your goal on Duolingo.

872
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:51,432
There is nothing that unlocks when your streak is high.

873
00:46:51,732 --> 00:46:55,034
There's very little social proof or ability to show off your streak.

874
00:46:55,534 --> 00:46:57,775
There is no currency attached to your streak.

875
00:46:58,035 --> 00:47:00,316
We don't gate any learning content on your streak.

876
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:03,561
It's simply a number that people are proud of,

877
00:47:03,581 --> 00:47:06,543
and it doesn't actually gain you anything in our app.

878
00:47:07,624 --> 00:47:10,167
But our users care so deeply about it

879
00:47:10,427 --> 00:47:12,309
and find it incredibly motivating,

880
00:47:13,009 --> 00:47:15,532
so much in fact that they get devastated

881
00:47:15,672 --> 00:47:17,273
when they lose a long streak.

882
00:47:18,654 --> 00:47:21,117
In response, we created the idea of a streak repair,

883
00:47:21,877 --> 00:47:23,659
the ability to repair your streak

884
00:47:23,799 --> 00:47:25,321
if you accidentally missed a day.

885
00:47:26,310 --> 00:47:30,533
And to illustrate how much this simple little flame motivator

886
00:47:30,573 --> 00:47:35,036
mattered, we tested offering one free monthly streak repair

887
00:47:35,337 --> 00:47:36,858
as part of our subscription perk.

888
00:47:37,838 --> 00:47:39,680
And when we did this, subscription revenue

889
00:47:39,720 --> 00:47:40,380
increased almost 60%.

890
00:47:44,083 --> 00:47:48,566
60% subscription revenue, because users really

891
00:47:48,646 --> 00:47:50,847
care about this little flame icon that

892
00:47:50,867 --> 00:47:52,088
got them nothing in the app.

893
00:47:53,415 --> 00:47:57,817
So never underestimate the power of a simple UI element,

894
00:47:58,277 --> 00:48:00,358
whether it's a motivational message,

895
00:48:00,458 --> 00:48:03,199
an awesome animation, a color change,

896
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:06,801
or a tiny flame in the app that you wanna keep burning

897
00:48:06,861 --> 00:48:07,982
for hundreds of days.

898
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:11,303
You might be surprised how motivating

899
00:48:11,383 --> 00:48:12,724
these things really can be.

900
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:17,606
So let me take a few minutes to recap lessons today

901
00:48:17,726 --> 00:48:20,027
about how to create a good learning experience

902
00:48:20,167 --> 00:48:20,888
within your game.

903
00:48:22,200 --> 00:48:24,501
So here are things you should probably do yesterday,

904
00:48:24,821 --> 00:48:26,882
but at least do them as soon as possible.

905
00:48:27,862 --> 00:48:31,123
First, identify holes in what you're currently measuring,

906
00:48:31,663 --> 00:48:34,584
making sure that you have good indicators for results

907
00:48:34,744 --> 00:48:36,104
and not just activity.

908
00:48:36,924 --> 00:48:39,185
Create learning indicators to see if players

909
00:48:39,245 --> 00:48:41,265
are actually learning what you need them to.

910
00:48:43,247 --> 00:48:45,669
Invest in a good A-B testing framework.

911
00:48:45,989 --> 00:48:49,352
Like I said, we went from 13% D1 retention to 55%,

912
00:48:50,112 --> 00:48:53,315
just from incremental changes in A-B testing everything.

913
00:48:54,596 --> 00:48:56,638
Remember to cut out the noise from players

914
00:48:56,678 --> 00:48:59,260
who aren't exposed to the experience you want to test,

915
00:48:59,621 --> 00:49:02,123
and you'll get a lot more statistical power that way.

916
00:49:02,923 --> 00:49:06,947
Use A-B tests to see how much new features help and hurt

917
00:49:07,367 --> 00:49:08,648
to keep yourself accountable.

918
00:49:09,689 --> 00:49:11,711
Improve your intuitions with data.

919
00:49:13,597 --> 00:49:16,740
And make all early stuff way easier.

920
00:49:17,601 --> 00:49:19,382
I can't recall a single experiment

921
00:49:19,442 --> 00:49:22,745
where making things easier hurt engagement within our app.

922
00:49:23,586 --> 00:49:25,287
However, the caveat is make sure

923
00:49:25,307 --> 00:49:27,109
that those learning indicators are in place

924
00:49:27,649 --> 00:49:29,891
so you ensure you aren't sacrificing too much

925
00:49:29,951 --> 00:49:31,052
for the sake of engagement.

926
00:49:32,914 --> 00:49:34,175
And then here are some actions

927
00:49:34,355 --> 00:49:36,357
that you can look into in the near future

928
00:49:36,537 --> 00:49:38,499
for improving the learning curve in your games.

929
00:49:40,126 --> 00:49:43,167
Remember to identify and deliver the smallest unit

930
00:49:43,228 --> 00:49:46,689
of satisfaction as early as possible to your players.

931
00:49:47,390 --> 00:49:49,471
Give them the confidence that they can do this,

932
00:49:49,811 --> 00:49:51,992
they can conquer and get good at your game.

933
00:49:52,632 --> 00:49:55,454
Get them interested in the first few minutes of play

934
00:49:56,034 --> 00:49:57,975
and provide that baby step needed

935
00:49:58,055 --> 00:49:59,776
to start climbing that learning curve.

936
00:50:01,777 --> 00:50:04,098
Disguise boring concepts by replacing

937
00:50:04,118 --> 00:50:05,839
or pairing them with interesting ones.

938
00:50:06,927 --> 00:50:10,490
If you can come up with a good way to make volume adjustment fun, do it.

939
00:50:11,550 --> 00:50:16,354
Look at what steps seem to have higher user drop-off and target those first as areas of

940
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:16,915
improvement.

941
00:50:18,756 --> 00:50:23,500
Scaffold difficulty in your game if you want to appeal to a wider range of players.

942
00:50:24,201 --> 00:50:29,605
Provide paths for both breadth and depth so that more beginner gamers can enjoy your game

943
00:50:30,126 --> 00:50:32,708
and advanced players can have a blast mastering it.

944
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,886
Perform the utterly screwed test on your game.

945
00:50:37,526 --> 00:50:40,387
Are there parts of it where the player would be totally lost

946
00:50:40,547 --> 00:50:42,308
if they just picked it back up at that point?

947
00:50:43,488 --> 00:50:46,189
Try to create ways to recover at those points.

948
00:50:46,989 --> 00:50:49,830
Winning back users who want to give your game a second chance

949
00:50:50,391 --> 00:50:53,352
can be critical to improving your daily active user numbers.

950
00:50:55,212 --> 00:50:55,773
Remove text.

951
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,094
It's likely you could probably remove half the text in your game.

952
00:51:01,115 --> 00:51:02,695
And finally, add delight.

953
00:51:03,624 --> 00:51:05,948
Find ways to intervene when the player needs help

954
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:08,412
and to encourage the player when they're crushing it,

955
00:51:08,973 --> 00:51:11,618
even if it's by really simple UI elements.

956
00:51:13,903 --> 00:51:16,324
So if you want to talk about specific ideas for your game,

957
00:51:16,544 --> 00:51:18,244
have questions about Duolingo or learning,

958
00:51:18,645 --> 00:51:21,685
or just want to say hi, feel free to reach me at this email.

959
00:51:22,265 --> 00:51:24,106
I'm also happy to take a few questions now

960
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,966
and after the talk in the wrap-up area.

961
00:51:25,986 --> 00:51:28,367
So thank you all so much for coming out today.

962
00:51:28,507 --> 00:51:30,427
Safe travels home, and I'm looking forward

963
00:51:30,447 --> 00:51:33,348
to continuing to be inspired by all the games you create

964
00:51:33,448 --> 00:51:34,268
in the years to come.

965
00:51:34,688 --> 00:51:34,988
Thank you.

966
00:51:46,144 --> 00:51:46,745
Oh boy, hello.

967
00:51:47,105 --> 00:51:47,505
Hi Karen.

968
00:51:47,926 --> 00:51:47,966
Hi.

969
00:51:48,166 --> 00:51:49,107
Thanks, that was a great talk.

970
00:51:49,247 --> 00:51:50,288
Thank you.

971
00:51:50,808 --> 00:51:51,689
Regarding streaks.

972
00:51:52,049 --> 00:51:52,330
Yes.

973
00:51:52,630 --> 00:51:54,051
Did you guys test anything,

974
00:51:54,572 --> 00:51:56,673
like rewards or anything related to streaks?

975
00:51:56,853 --> 00:52:03,638
Yeah, absolutely. So we are looking into a few things. One thing that happens is we have an in-game currency that we call Lingits right now.

976
00:52:03,758 --> 00:52:09,781
And as you get streaks of multiple 10, you actually get a bunch of Lingits with it. So that has helped.

977
00:52:10,802 --> 00:52:16,565
One thing that we're also testing is how many days to sort of show in regards to your streak.

978
00:52:16,585 --> 00:52:22,429
Like if we could get users to just a three-day streak, maybe they're more likely to do a seven-day streak, things like that.

979
00:52:22,489 --> 00:52:25,571
So we're always playing around with streak because it's such an important motivator.

980
00:52:26,291 --> 00:52:26,631
Thank you.

981
00:52:26,831 --> 00:52:27,192
Thank you.

982
00:52:28,673 --> 00:52:28,853
Hi.

983
00:52:29,494 --> 00:52:30,174
Hi.

984
00:52:30,735 --> 00:52:34,818
How do you process feedback from your users?

985
00:52:35,379 --> 00:52:37,721
For example, that one was talking

986
00:52:37,761 --> 00:52:40,143
about one word that was wrong.

987
00:52:40,763 --> 00:52:42,525
How do you process that inside?

988
00:52:42,565 --> 00:52:49,951
How is the team working on this feedback to upgrade Duolingo?

989
00:52:50,051 --> 00:52:51,631
Yeah, that's a great question.

990
00:52:51,711 --> 00:52:55,772
So there are a lot of channels for user feedback.

991
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:57,613
One thing that I mentioned in the talk,

992
00:52:57,673 --> 00:53:00,033
too, is sometimes words aren't always

993
00:53:00,093 --> 00:53:01,534
as indicative as actions.

994
00:53:01,614 --> 00:53:04,654
So we try to rely on our metrics as much as possible.

995
00:53:05,174 --> 00:53:08,035
Like, are users getting frustrated and quitting

996
00:53:08,115 --> 00:53:10,396
right after they get this thing wrong, et cetera?

997
00:53:10,776 --> 00:53:12,776
But in terms of qualitative feedback,

998
00:53:12,816 --> 00:53:16,197
and not just quantitative, we do have a customer support

999
00:53:16,357 --> 00:53:19,738
that processes reports and error reports from our users.

1000
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:28,086
And a lot of us that work in product also constantly check our user forums and our app rating reviews to see if there's any good qualitative feedback we can gain.

1001
00:53:28,607 --> 00:53:33,292
It is a lot of work to process all of that qualitative feedback, but it's also really important.

1002
00:53:34,273 --> 00:53:34,593
Thank you.

1003
00:53:34,954 --> 00:53:35,234
Thank you.

1004
00:53:36,558 --> 00:53:38,179
Hello, and thank you for the talk.

1005
00:53:38,420 --> 00:53:39,780
I want to ask something, but first,

1006
00:53:39,860 --> 00:53:42,642
because I'm not so familiar with your app,

1007
00:53:43,062 --> 00:53:45,624
what sort of monetization scheme do you have?

1008
00:53:45,764 --> 00:53:46,745
Yeah, that's a great question.

1009
00:53:46,825 --> 00:53:49,266
So we make revenue from ads,

1010
00:53:49,326 --> 00:53:51,227
and we also do a subscription model.

1011
00:53:51,327 --> 00:53:53,889
So for a while we did in-app purchases,

1012
00:53:54,109 --> 00:53:55,750
ads, as well as a subscription model.

1013
00:53:56,851 --> 00:53:58,612
One of the key tenets of Duolingo's mission

1014
00:53:58,652 --> 00:54:01,674
is we want all learning content to be free for anyone,

1015
00:54:02,134 --> 00:54:05,216
because not everyone has the means to pay for education.

1016
00:54:06,017 --> 00:54:10,804
So our subscription model allows users to do things like download lessons offline, get

1017
00:54:10,864 --> 00:54:13,588
a free streak repair, and things like that.

1018
00:54:14,028 --> 00:54:18,255
And we have found that subscriptions are probably going to be our main source of revenue.

1019
00:54:19,160 --> 00:54:26,704
I see. So it seems that you're very centric about looking at the metrics to see what works and what doesn't.

1020
00:54:27,264 --> 00:54:32,127
Now, you also mentioned at some point that sometimes you can skew the data or look at it in a weird way.

1021
00:54:32,247 --> 00:54:35,128
So you artificially create the results you want.

1022
00:54:36,349 --> 00:54:45,693
What sort of filters or checks do you have in place to confirm whether a certain metric that seems to be pointing in the right direction really does so?

1023
00:54:46,377 --> 00:54:57,080
Yeah, that's a fantastic question. And honestly, it's sort of hard to have something in place because the people who are prone to those tendencies will need to also be the ones that put checks and balances in place.

1024
00:54:57,640 --> 00:55:05,622
So, for example, on the teams I'm on with learning, it's our goal to not decrease things like retention and D1, D1 retention and DAUs.

1025
00:55:06,683 --> 00:55:15,696
And we have this other metric that we call the learning metric, based on those sort of quiz scores on how users are doing and how they're learning, that tries to keep us accountable, right?

1026
00:55:15,816 --> 00:55:22,266
If we increase engagement a ton by just making things way easier, but people are learning less, we see that other metric go down.

1027
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:29,973
So what I would suggest is just going through the thought process and exercise of seeing what things you can cheat on and then

1028
00:55:30,434 --> 00:55:35,899
making metrics on top of those things to go the other way to keep yourself in

1029
00:55:35,959 --> 00:55:40,664
checks and balances and sometimes you just need really honest co-workers to help you with that too.

1030
00:55:40,684 --> 00:55:42,065
Thank you.

1031
00:55:43,670 --> 00:55:47,812
Hi. So we make kids a learning product for much younger age range.

1032
00:55:47,992 --> 00:55:51,713
And one of the things we always run into is this balance between learning and fun.

1033
00:55:51,913 --> 00:55:52,273
Oh, yeah.

1034
00:55:52,573 --> 00:55:59,956
Yeah. So I'm interested in how you guys define like either boundaries or, you know, guidelines to make those kind of trade-offs.

1035
00:56:00,096 --> 00:56:04,401
Yeah, I mean, this is the problem that we've had ever since the beginning of Duolingo,

1036
00:56:04,441 --> 00:56:08,527
and it's definitely not one that we've actually solved. We're constantly improving it.

1037
00:56:08,867 --> 00:56:13,453
But what has really helped is, between learning engagement, like I said,

1038
00:56:13,533 --> 00:56:17,217
if you can measure both, you can see what changes actually improve both.

1039
00:56:17,798 --> 00:56:19,539
And then you can try to avoid situations

1040
00:56:19,559 --> 00:56:21,681
where you have to choose between one or the other.

1041
00:56:21,741 --> 00:56:24,403
So for example, the crown levels experiment I presented

1042
00:56:24,803 --> 00:56:27,265
was one where we got really great wins in both.

1043
00:56:27,645 --> 00:56:29,747
Whenever we revamp our curriculum,

1044
00:56:29,787 --> 00:56:31,548
we also see gains in both.

1045
00:56:32,089 --> 00:56:33,590
So we're sort of procrastinating

1046
00:56:33,650 --> 00:56:35,071
on how we can do that trade-off

1047
00:56:35,111 --> 00:56:37,373
by just trying to first target features

1048
00:56:37,453 --> 00:56:39,254
that would actually increase both of these things

1049
00:56:39,294 --> 00:56:40,055
at the same time.

1050
00:56:40,075 --> 00:56:43,317
Hello.

1051
00:56:43,677 --> 00:56:43,778
Hi.

1052
00:56:44,392 --> 00:56:50,979
Thank you so much for the talk. I wrote my question down. So, A-B experiments that feature

1053
00:56:51,059 --> 00:56:56,866
large changes, such as revamping the entire fundamental curriculum, take time to deliver

1054
00:56:57,006 --> 00:57:03,413
quantifiable results. This makes measuring the results in a timely manner much more difficult.

1055
00:57:04,194 --> 00:57:08,458
In this kind of situation, how do you know if these types of changes are the correct changes?

1056
00:57:08,918 --> 00:57:13,503
And as a side question, when is it right to disregard all metrics and go with your gut feeling?

1057
00:57:13,543 --> 00:57:17,386
Yeah, oh gosh, that's so hard. So, Duolingo actually has another app called Tiny Cards

1058
00:57:17,406 --> 00:57:20,790
that I worked on for a while. And this is an example of an app that didn't have that many

1059
00:57:20,930 --> 00:57:25,194
users, so we couldn't rely on just sheer numbers to deliver really quick metrics results.

1060
00:57:25,514 --> 00:57:27,695
And I'm sure a lot of games are in this situation.

1061
00:57:28,215 --> 00:57:30,416
So sometimes what you have to do is sort of rely

1062
00:57:30,476 --> 00:57:32,196
on the best practices and measurements

1063
00:57:32,356 --> 00:57:36,037
and the tests that other larger companies have already run

1064
00:57:36,337 --> 00:57:37,878
in order to just make a best guess

1065
00:57:37,898 --> 00:57:39,298
for what might work for your game.

1066
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:42,459
I will say that usually it's very rare

1067
00:57:42,499 --> 00:57:44,740
that we disregard all metrics and go with gut.

1068
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:51,485
But we do actually, a mission and core values really helps you keep true to at least things that you don't want to compromise on.

1069
00:57:51,506 --> 00:57:56,350
So for example, if we started charging for learning content, I bet we could make a ton more money.

1070
00:57:56,730 --> 00:58:00,494
But that is something that we just encode in our values that we're never going to try.

1071
00:58:01,875 --> 00:58:07,518
So, it's hard, right, but I think if you have really fundamental core values in place and

1072
00:58:07,538 --> 00:58:12,542
build teams around it, if you're willing to take risks sometimes for larger features and

1073
00:58:12,562 --> 00:58:16,865
just see how they do, you'll still be able to move quickly even if you don't have huge

1074
00:58:16,965 --> 00:58:19,066
user numbers to get you results within a few days.

1075
00:58:19,767 --> 00:58:20,087
Thank you.

1076
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:24,810
And just a note, I think we're going to be kicked out in the next 30 seconds or so, so

1077
00:58:24,850 --> 00:58:29,113
I'll take one more question and then I'm happy to just head on over to the wrap-up room right

1078
00:58:29,153 --> 00:58:29,553
after this.

1079
00:58:31,219 --> 00:58:31,580
Go for it.

1080
00:58:32,221 --> 00:58:34,304
So when you're running multiple A-B tests,

1081
00:58:34,424 --> 00:58:35,786
are there any measures or strategies

1082
00:58:35,806 --> 00:58:38,410
you use to make sure one test is not biasing

1083
00:58:38,430 --> 00:58:39,532
the results of the other test?

1084
00:58:39,953 --> 00:58:41,535
Yeah, so the beauty of A-B tests is

1085
00:58:41,575 --> 00:58:43,258
because it's a completely random sample,

1086
00:58:45,108 --> 00:58:48,110
It's supposed to be the case that whenever you have a test

1087
00:58:48,950 --> 00:58:50,631
that splits up users into two buckets,

1088
00:58:51,132 --> 00:58:53,793
any test also takes a random sampling of those two buckets.

1089
00:58:53,833 --> 00:58:55,794
So you can do sort of cohort analysis

1090
00:58:55,855 --> 00:58:59,717
and see, hey, users in these two experiments, those two really

1091
00:58:59,777 --> 00:59:00,858
don't interact very well.

1092
00:59:01,478 --> 00:59:03,119
or you can see bonuses there.

1093
00:59:03,219 --> 00:59:04,920
So we have sort of things in place

1094
00:59:04,940 --> 00:59:06,460
to try to prevent us from doing that.

1095
00:59:06,900 --> 00:59:08,881
But the also key is all of the experiments

1096
00:59:08,901 --> 00:59:10,442
should be independent of each other.

1097
00:59:11,022 --> 00:59:13,504
So if you have experiment A running,

1098
00:59:13,524 --> 00:59:17,305
a user's just as likely to be in experiment B

1099
00:59:17,385 --> 00:59:19,586
or not in experiment B if they're in experiment A.

1100
00:59:20,227 --> 00:59:20,427
Got it.

1101
00:59:20,527 --> 00:59:20,747
Thanks.

1102
00:59:21,607 --> 00:59:22,208
All right.

1103
00:59:22,268 --> 00:59:24,249
I'm very happy to go over to the wrap-up after.

1104
00:59:24,289 --> 00:59:25,329
Thank you so much, everyone.
