1
00:00:05,527 --> 00:00:07,208
Hi everybody, well that was unexpected.

2
00:00:07,289 --> 00:00:15,478
Welcome to sunny San Francisco and the first day of GDC 2019 and the third State and Future

3
00:00:15,618 --> 00:00:21,204
of Board Games panel which I'm very excited to present this year.

4
00:00:21,284 --> 00:00:24,408
I'm Paul Dean, I'm one of the co-founders of Shut Up and Sit Down, I'm also a writer

5
00:00:24,448 --> 00:00:25,429
and a games journalist.

6
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,223
a wannabe games designer and so many other things, but more interesting than me are three

7
00:00:31,303 --> 00:00:34,726
other wonderful people on a panel who have agreed to appear this year.

8
00:00:34,786 --> 00:00:39,349
Starting as far away from me as possible, I'd like everyone to introduce themselves

9
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:41,911
because this year we have a particularly awesome panel.

10
00:00:43,971 --> 00:00:48,837
I'm Jen Sandacock. I make edible tabletop games, so they're games that you actually have to eat.

11
00:00:49,718 --> 00:00:58,810
So I've put 13 different games into a cookbook which is part recipes, part rules, and yeah.

12
00:01:01,773 --> 00:01:02,154
Jonathan.

13
00:01:03,627 --> 00:01:06,148
Hi everyone, I'm Jonathan Ying, I'm a game designer.

14
00:01:06,789 --> 00:01:11,992
I've worked with, I've done a lot of game design for a number of different games, including

15
00:01:12,052 --> 00:01:17,035
Star Wars Imperial Assault, Doom the board game, Game of Thrones trivia, and more recently

16
00:01:17,455 --> 00:01:23,259
Power Rangers Heroes of the Grid, Nickelodeon Splat Attack, and Sonic Dice Rush, which is

17
00:01:23,299 --> 00:01:24,080
coming out very soon.

18
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:25,100
I didn't know about that.

19
00:01:25,340 --> 00:01:26,301
Yeah.

20
00:01:26,621 --> 00:01:30,924
And I've also done games independently, a game called Bargain Quest, which was covered

21
00:01:30,944 --> 00:01:31,704
by Shout Up and Sit Down.

22
00:01:32,547 --> 00:01:34,899
And yeah, I just do a lot of game design.

23
00:01:34,919 --> 00:01:36,748
And Susan.

24
00:01:37,637 --> 00:01:40,838
Hi, I'm Susan McKinley-Ross, and I'm a toy and game designer.

25
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,220
I've licensed over 40 products and over a dozen games.

26
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:47,341
The most popular is Quirkle, which

27
00:01:47,381 --> 00:01:50,902
has been described as Scrabble with shapes and colors.

28
00:01:51,023 --> 00:01:52,983
Quirkle won the Spiel des Jahres in 2011.

29
00:01:53,704 --> 00:01:55,405
And another game I designed that's done really well

30
00:01:55,445 --> 00:01:56,685
is called Hoot Owl Hoot.

31
00:01:56,845 --> 00:01:59,246
It's a cooperative game where children

32
00:01:59,286 --> 00:02:01,327
are trying to get the owls back to the nest

33
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:02,408
before the sun comes up.

34
00:02:02,968 --> 00:02:04,008
And because of my toy background,

35
00:02:04,028 --> 00:02:05,529
I'm mostly in the family games market.

36
00:02:07,013 --> 00:02:08,093
Thank you all for coming.

37
00:02:08,293 --> 00:02:09,894
I would like to ask, oh, by the way,

38
00:02:09,914 --> 00:02:11,175
I should tell you all the format for this

39
00:02:11,195 --> 00:02:12,636
for the last few years has always been,

40
00:02:13,096 --> 00:02:15,957
we'll talk about a few topics together on the panel

41
00:02:16,037 --> 00:02:17,618
for about sort of 30, 40 minutes,

42
00:02:17,658 --> 00:02:19,279
and then we'll open up to the floor.

43
00:02:19,679 --> 00:02:21,960
Please come at us with any questions you like.

44
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:24,181
We have such a diverse range of people this year

45
00:02:24,522 --> 00:02:26,563
that I think you could touch on anything

46
00:02:26,623 --> 00:02:28,444
and someone will have something cool to say about it.

47
00:02:29,544 --> 00:02:32,185
We actually started an hour early in the.

48
00:02:32,205 --> 00:02:32,626
Thank you.

49
00:02:33,423 --> 00:02:36,548
in the speakers lounge by accident just talking about stuff we're excited by.

50
00:02:36,948 --> 00:02:40,974
Can I ask you all what in the last 12 months

51
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:44,880
has excited you most in tabletop gaming? What do you think

52
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:47,363
is most interesting right now?

53
00:02:50,021 --> 00:02:51,322
We're going to start down this end, alright, sure.

54
00:02:51,342 --> 00:02:53,023
I mean, we'll just do whatever we want.

55
00:02:53,404 --> 00:02:56,487
I think for me, some of the stuff, I mean, other than like personal successes,

56
00:02:56,547 --> 00:02:58,789
I think some of the stuff I'm interested in is seeing

57
00:02:59,689 --> 00:03:04,234
much more wider recognition of a wider range of tabletop games.

58
00:03:04,254 --> 00:03:06,516
They're not all quite hardcore games.

59
00:03:06,536 --> 00:03:09,378
There's a lot of stuff for families, or light games.

60
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:13,522
And there's a lot of food-themed games, which I like food-themed games.

61
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:14,763
I don't get why.

62
00:03:18,284 --> 00:03:18,944
Well, let's see.

63
00:03:19,044 --> 00:03:20,745
There's a couple of things that I've been finding

64
00:03:20,805 --> 00:03:22,126
really particularly exciting.

65
00:03:22,186 --> 00:03:23,407
Some of them are just games,

66
00:03:23,867 --> 00:03:25,668
technology is continuing to evolve,

67
00:03:25,688 --> 00:03:28,570
like manufacturing technology, particularly fantasy players.

68
00:03:28,810 --> 00:03:30,931
There was a talk earlier today about Key Forge, right?

69
00:03:30,971 --> 00:03:32,512
The first unique deck game,

70
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:37,515
which even like a year ago would not have been possible

71
00:03:37,615 --> 00:03:40,437
to produce just because of the limitations

72
00:03:40,477 --> 00:03:41,238
of digital printing.

73
00:03:41,258 --> 00:03:42,859
And like they've created a whole new method

74
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,820
that have opened up a huge range

75
00:03:44,860 --> 00:03:46,501
of new possibilities for design.

76
00:03:47,221 --> 00:03:52,566
And a lot of that kind of innovation is happening right now, and I'm just super excited to see what's coming down the pipe.

77
00:03:54,628 --> 00:04:01,956
The other thing that I'm really excited about is that there's a lot more multimedia board game stuff going on.

78
00:04:02,836 --> 00:04:07,081
Things like Renegade Games has T-Dragon Society, which is both a board game and a comic book.

79
00:04:07,969 --> 00:04:10,911
and they were working with Oni Press on that, and I just found that really charming, because

80
00:04:10,951 --> 00:04:17,316
a lot of games have wonderful worlds and awesome artwork, and we don't often get to explore

81
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:21,419
those worlds in the same way that we might explore Star Wars, which exists on every single

82
00:04:21,439 --> 00:04:22,079
possible level.

83
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:23,100
Oh my goodness, yes.

84
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,944
But if a franchise starts as a tabletop game or something like that, I mean, I guess we

85
00:04:27,964 --> 00:04:30,285
have the Clue movie, but, you know.

86
00:04:31,066 --> 00:04:32,167
And what a fine movie it is.

87
00:04:33,497 --> 00:04:38,268
But yeah, I think those are two things that I'm super excited about that have been coming out this year.

88
00:04:39,852 --> 00:04:45,393
Similarly, I'm really excited about the scope and the variety of games that are available right now.

89
00:04:45,433 --> 00:04:48,834
I feel like there's more interesting mechanics, there's more interesting themes,

90
00:04:48,874 --> 00:04:55,096
there's more interesting materials being used in games like food or toys or water or air.

91
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:59,517
People are doing new and novel things that I don't think would have been happening five years ago.

92
00:05:00,857 --> 00:05:05,939
I didn't go to Toy Fair this year, but I watched the reports from a website called The Game Isle,

93
00:05:05,999 --> 00:05:07,699
and basically she took photos of...

94
00:05:08,159 --> 00:05:11,444
all the cool games that were coming out and I was looking through them and I was

95
00:05:11,464 --> 00:05:12,165
getting that ping of

96
00:05:12,345 --> 00:05:16,410
oh I wish I designed that and that's an excellent feeling when you're looking at

97
00:05:16,471 --> 00:05:17,612
the games coming out and

98
00:05:17,772 --> 00:05:21,537
and they inspire you to to make things so I'm really excited about the variety

99
00:05:21,577 --> 00:05:22,218
of things that are out

100
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:23,079
on the market right now.

101
00:05:23,633 --> 00:05:27,877
Well we touched on this briefly before the panel started about is the market going to

102
00:05:27,937 --> 00:05:32,341
saturate at any point because it was, last year it was something like three and a half

103
00:05:32,421 --> 00:05:37,545
thousand new board games came out, which works out about ten new board games a day, which

104
00:05:37,625 --> 00:05:38,746
is too many for me to play.

105
00:05:38,767 --> 00:05:42,470
And Jonathan, you said something like four thousand this year?

106
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:47,915
Yeah, what I've heard reported is that about four thousand games have been announced or

107
00:05:48,055 --> 00:05:50,197
are already in production this year.

108
00:05:50,857 --> 00:05:52,518
Like, by now, right?

109
00:05:52,658 --> 00:05:54,998
How is that possible? How is there a market for that?

110
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,160
Turns out there's a lot of people, is the other thing, with a fair amount of income,

111
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,461
and also board games are spreading, right?

112
00:06:04,541 --> 00:06:08,422
Like, more and more communities are having access to board games or are learning about it.

113
00:06:08,542 --> 00:06:11,303
I mean, I think we could definitely credit things like Critical Role

114
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:15,544
for making things like Dungeons & Dragons feel much more mainstream.

115
00:06:17,468 --> 00:06:24,672
And just like the market is continuing to grow when people are finding more and like people are still finding success

116
00:06:25,672 --> 00:06:30,695
You know going for it, and I'm personally a little bit nervous about like how how far we can stretch this

117
00:06:32,175 --> 00:06:33,376
But it's so far

118
00:06:33,416 --> 00:06:40,980
It's continuing to you know trend outward and trend upward and more products and more people buying these products, and it's been crazy

119
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:42,920
It continues to be crazy

120
00:06:44,035 --> 00:06:47,836
I think as a designer and a gamer, I'm excited about the saturation.

121
00:06:47,856 --> 00:06:48,977
I think the market is saturated.

122
00:06:49,497 --> 00:06:52,538
If I were a publisher or a manufacturer or a retailer,

123
00:06:52,618 --> 00:06:55,239
I'd be much more worried about it because how do you

124
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,319
stock what's going to sell?

125
00:06:56,359 --> 00:06:58,300
How do you know what's going to work for your store?

126
00:06:59,521 --> 00:07:01,441
Many harder choices at that level.

127
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:04,222
But as a designer and a gamer, it's very exciting.

128
00:07:04,342 --> 00:07:07,304
And I also am worried about the short-term future.

129
00:07:07,384 --> 00:07:08,164
Is this sustainable?

130
00:07:08,204 --> 00:07:11,885
But I think there's some hope that we could eventually

131
00:07:11,905 --> 00:07:12,926
get to a book model.

132
00:07:13,506 --> 00:07:16,527
where there are lots of people who read a wide range of books,

133
00:07:17,067 --> 00:07:18,568
and there will be a lot of people

134
00:07:18,608 --> 00:07:20,029
who play a wide range of games.

135
00:07:20,889 --> 00:07:25,151
And I'm hoping that that's what can happen for our industry.

136
00:07:26,111 --> 00:07:28,532
And then the other thing is, I'm a gamer

137
00:07:28,592 --> 00:07:30,933
who had a game night this weekend,

138
00:07:31,174 --> 00:07:32,314
and Puerto Rico got played.

139
00:07:32,334 --> 00:07:33,234
And Puerto Rico's old.

140
00:07:33,274 --> 00:07:34,735
It shouldn't get played anymore at game nights.

141
00:07:35,135 --> 00:07:37,096
But it's a good game, and it ended up getting played.

142
00:07:37,496 --> 00:07:38,116
And I think we're

143
00:07:39,092 --> 00:07:42,513
There are gamers evolving now who are only going to play games once or twice.

144
00:07:42,533 --> 00:07:45,674
They're not going to keep Puerto Rico on their shelves for years and years and play it over

145
00:07:45,714 --> 00:07:46,275
and over again.

146
00:07:46,295 --> 00:07:48,236
And that's more like the book model.

147
00:07:48,696 --> 00:07:51,717
That's more you read a book once or you buy a book because you're interested in it.

148
00:07:51,757 --> 00:07:53,558
You don't necessarily get around to reading it.

149
00:07:53,978 --> 00:07:58,860
I'm hoping something like that can help the level of market situation that there is.

150
00:07:59,710 --> 00:08:05,653
Yeah, I do feel that this is having an interesting effect on people attempting to create lifestyle

151
00:08:05,673 --> 00:08:05,973
games.

152
00:08:06,574 --> 00:08:10,956
Like, you know, I'm not sure we'll ever get, or it'll be very challenging for another game

153
00:08:10,996 --> 00:08:15,999
to be like Magic the Gathering, where it's like that is the only game some gamers play.

154
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:20,862
Or like, you know, there's just so many options out there and it's so hard to make it.

155
00:08:21,342 --> 00:08:24,004
your one hobby is following this one game

156
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:25,024
and all of its expansions.

157
00:08:25,144 --> 00:08:26,785
Now it's like, oh, here's a game I like,

158
00:08:26,805 --> 00:08:27,625
I've played it a couple times,

159
00:08:27,805 --> 00:08:29,046
and if an expansion comes out,

160
00:08:29,146 --> 00:08:30,126
maybe I'll break it out again.

161
00:08:30,627 --> 00:08:32,247
And that is becoming more and more of a thing,

162
00:08:32,308 --> 00:08:35,509
but usually for people who are financially stable enough

163
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:38,530
to use games as a leisure activity.

164
00:08:38,550 --> 00:08:41,012
They are still, games are still a luxury product,

165
00:08:41,352 --> 00:08:43,793
which is, yeah, has continued to be true.

166
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:52,826
And they're just becoming a more and more popular luxury product, which is also exciting, but I think we should pay attention to that.

167
00:08:53,707 --> 00:08:58,773
Accessibility is a big deal in board games right now, and as games become more...

168
00:08:59,864 --> 00:09:02,625
more popular, we also want them to become more accessible

169
00:09:02,665 --> 00:09:03,625
to bring in new players.

170
00:09:04,185 --> 00:09:07,526
Because, you know, this is not,

171
00:09:07,606 --> 00:09:09,086
there are a lot of players out there,

172
00:09:09,106 --> 00:09:10,266
but not all of them are interested

173
00:09:10,366 --> 00:09:12,986
in exactly the same themes or exactly the same mechanics.

174
00:09:13,227 --> 00:09:14,627
Some people, you know, want to play games

175
00:09:14,867 --> 00:09:15,867
while having a snack.

176
00:09:16,407 --> 00:09:19,148
I was gonna say, I mean, that could be someone's entry

177
00:09:19,208 --> 00:09:21,528
into tabletop gaming, could be edible games.

178
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:25,129
That could be this bizarre but fascinating vector

179
00:09:25,289 --> 00:09:27,129
of that spreading.

180
00:09:27,865 --> 00:09:33,870
Yeah, I mean, I do feel like somewhat I've tried to target bakers as well as gamers.

181
00:09:33,930 --> 00:09:38,533
Most of my games aren't super hardcore games, so if somebody is a hardcore gamer, they probably

182
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:42,757
will bounce off my games a bit, but people who are like, oh, I want to do a fun thing

183
00:09:42,777 --> 00:09:46,520
before maybe I play a hardcore game, or I really love baking and I want to show off

184
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,703
all my amazing baking skills, there's games for that in the book.

185
00:09:50,999 --> 00:09:56,623
So, sort of reflecting on that then, what makes it interesting to be a board games designer now in 2019?

186
00:09:56,663 --> 00:09:59,845
There's a lot of people at GDC who are more and more interested in board games.

187
00:10:00,325 --> 00:10:06,009
Loads of people prototype things on tabletop if they're thinking of going into digital games design.

188
00:10:06,630 --> 00:10:10,272
Why should they stick with board games? Why should a person be a board games designer?

189
00:10:12,847 --> 00:10:18,631
I think partly like Kickstarter is still like there are a lot of games on Kickstarter but

190
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:21,433
if you have a genuinely good idea it will

191
00:10:21,969 --> 00:10:24,550
come to the surface and people will find out about it.

192
00:10:24,650 --> 00:10:27,151
Because I think there's generally in the tabletop space,

193
00:10:27,171 --> 00:10:29,631
there's people who every week check Kickstarter,

194
00:10:29,691 --> 00:10:31,172
what are the Kickstarters out right now?

195
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:35,093
And so people are consciously looking through that system.

196
00:10:35,153 --> 00:10:38,234
And so I think if you are able to come up with something

197
00:10:38,274 --> 00:10:40,615
that's able to stand out from the hundreds of games

198
00:10:40,675 --> 00:10:42,635
that are out on Kickstarter at any one time,

199
00:10:43,155 --> 00:10:44,996
then there's a chance for you.

200
00:10:45,056 --> 00:10:47,477
And that feels good that genuinely good products

201
00:10:47,517 --> 00:10:50,398
can still stand out and be noticed.

202
00:10:53,393 --> 00:10:57,576
I mean, sort of part and parcel to the fact that we're getting so many more games coming out, right?

203
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:03,579
The systems for actually manufacturing those games are becoming more and more accessible, right?

204
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:08,222
We're having websites like GameCrafter now allows you to do custom punch-outs,

205
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,524
which they weren't doing a couple of years ago.

206
00:11:10,684 --> 00:11:15,226
And all of these things will allow people to make even really small print runs of games

207
00:11:15,567 --> 00:11:17,168
just for themselves, just for their hobby.

208
00:11:17,648 --> 00:11:19,609
And once you have that, maybe you're going to try and like...

209
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,473
run a Kickstarter or maybe you're going to try and pitch it to a publisher.

210
00:11:24,213 --> 00:11:29,178
And that, you know, the barrier for entry for board games is lower than it's ever been,

211
00:11:29,198 --> 00:11:30,179
honestly.

212
00:11:30,699 --> 00:11:35,984
And the ability for people who have access to the internet to create a game that looks

213
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:41,028
nice and that feels professional really kind of fuels that dream and that desire to make

214
00:11:41,048 --> 00:11:41,168
money.

215
00:11:41,689 --> 00:11:43,991
something cool and to put it out there.

216
00:11:44,792 --> 00:11:48,195
And even as big as the board game market is growing,

217
00:11:48,435 --> 00:11:49,637
people are hungry.

218
00:11:49,677 --> 00:11:52,860
People want, like, with all these games coming out,

219
00:11:52,900 --> 00:11:55,523
players are having a harder time finding exactly the game

220
00:11:55,543 --> 00:11:58,125
that suits the thing that they really personally want, right?

221
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:02,326
And there was a long time when in video games,

222
00:12:02,667 --> 00:12:05,008
where like people weren't making adventure games, right?

223
00:12:05,428 --> 00:12:05,648
Yes.

224
00:12:05,889 --> 00:12:08,930
And then once, and so no one was serving that market

225
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:11,132
because that market was considered a niche market.

226
00:12:11,452 --> 00:12:13,453
I think a similar thing is happening in tabletop.

227
00:12:13,894 --> 00:12:19,876
right, where we are able to now make games that are more targeted at a specific group

228
00:12:19,916 --> 00:12:25,398
of people or at a specific audience that is currently underserved or that just like, you

229
00:12:25,438 --> 00:12:29,940
know, they want a new thing that fits their paradigm for their type of gamer.

230
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:33,261
Yeah, that's fair.

231
00:12:33,281 --> 00:12:35,702
Well, then, I mean, with that in mind, if Kickstarter exists,

232
00:12:36,002 --> 00:12:38,643
if all this infrastructure is appearing,

233
00:12:39,444 --> 00:12:42,025
is Kickstarter the place that independents should start?

234
00:12:42,045 --> 00:12:44,106
If there are people here who want to make their own board

235
00:12:44,126 --> 00:12:46,466
games, where would you tell them to go?

236
00:12:46,607 --> 00:12:48,207
Should they be pitching to big publishers?

237
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:51,749
I think you're going to get a range of answers

238
00:12:51,769 --> 00:12:55,110
to that question, so we should each take it, yeah.

239
00:12:55,590 --> 00:12:56,250
Yeah, I mean, I think.

240
00:12:57,435 --> 00:13:02,617
I think there are opportunities on Kickstarter, but I was looking over Kickstarter earlier

241
00:13:02,657 --> 00:13:07,819
this week about what's available right now, and I am constantly looking at what's on Kickstarter.

242
00:13:08,219 --> 00:13:12,680
And it does feel like the games that are successful are people who are not first-time creators.

243
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,461
So it does seem like it's very, you know, unless you have something that really stands

244
00:13:17,602 --> 00:13:19,302
out, it's very difficult to...

245
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:24,554
get started. It's better than probably digital games I would say still

246
00:13:24,995 --> 00:13:28,804
to be able to get in. The barrier to entry is okay but it's not easy.

247
00:13:31,474 --> 00:13:38,879
So when I started my business I had been a product developer and a product designer and I started my company with the express purpose of product design.

248
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:45,943
I'd done product development, I know how important safety, packaging, advertising, shipping, all of it is.

249
00:13:46,564 --> 00:13:51,747
And I knew that that's an expertise that wasn't what I wanted to have, I wanted to focus on the design part.

250
00:13:52,207 --> 00:13:55,330
And I really, I didn't have the opportunity for Kickstarter when I started.

251
00:13:56,350 --> 00:13:59,953
But I wouldn't have gone that route anyway because I really like having a partner.

252
00:14:00,453 --> 00:14:03,654
who has that expertise and takes over that part of the job.

253
00:14:04,815 --> 00:14:09,757
Angie Holmstrom is the wholesale manager for Mindware

254
00:14:09,877 --> 00:14:11,657
and she sells Quirkle all over the world

255
00:14:12,278 --> 00:14:13,478
so much better than I can.

256
00:14:14,139 --> 00:14:16,860
And I'm so glad that I have a team doing all of that

257
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,701
and working on my behalf on the game all the time

258
00:14:19,741 --> 00:14:21,161
when I'm working on the next game.

259
00:14:23,123 --> 00:14:28,907
So for me, having a publisher and having the eyes of a publisher and the polish of a publisher

260
00:14:29,467 --> 00:14:32,850
and the expertise of a publisher is my preference as a designer,

261
00:14:32,990 --> 00:14:39,755
but I recognize the financial incentive for Kickstarter can work much better for designers,

262
00:14:40,235 --> 00:14:43,518
and if you're willing to put in the extra work that Kickstarter requires,

263
00:14:44,418 --> 00:14:48,981
you can really maintain control of your game in a way that you might not necessarily be able to with a publisher.

264
00:14:50,177 --> 00:14:52,398
Can I just say though, like on the Kickstarter front,

265
00:14:52,678 --> 00:14:54,519
I feel like you can't ever get enough money

266
00:14:54,579 --> 00:14:57,501
to be able to make it, to be able to pay yourself at all.

267
00:14:57,521 --> 00:14:59,742
You can get enough money to make a product.

268
00:14:59,802 --> 00:15:02,144
Like if all you're doing is trying to get your dream

269
00:15:02,184 --> 00:15:03,725
out there, Kickstarter will do that.

270
00:15:03,765 --> 00:15:06,266
But like, I think like having the other person

271
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:07,867
to look after a bunch of stuff,

272
00:15:08,067 --> 00:15:10,348
it really takes a lot of time to do all of that.

273
00:15:10,809 --> 00:15:15,272
And the nice part of having the publisher is I designed Quirkle in 2006.

274
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:20,475
I'm continuing to design Quirkle spin-offs and expansions because that's what I've been asked for.

275
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:28,440
But I'm not... they're continuing to work on it and grow it and I can spend my time on other things.

276
00:15:28,521 --> 00:15:34,565
So it's really nice having other people invested in the growth of something you're working on

277
00:15:34,945 --> 00:15:38,087
and you can move on to the next design project. I really appreciate that.

278
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:43,072
Yeah, I feel like as a platform, Kickstarter has changed a lot over the years.

279
00:15:43,212 --> 00:15:47,436
It's become a little bit more, in some ways, much more stable.

280
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:52,382
Like there are a lot more sort of orthodox ways of running a Kickstarter, which is both

281
00:15:52,422 --> 00:15:54,524
good and bad because there are all these rules that people follow.

282
00:15:54,584 --> 00:15:58,548
Like one of the fascinating things is like the rule of thumb is like launch your Kickstarter

283
00:15:58,588 --> 00:15:59,149
on a Tuesday.

284
00:16:00,230 --> 00:16:02,431
And that's like, that's the idea.

285
00:16:02,691 --> 00:16:04,312
But, but here's the thing, right?

286
00:16:04,933 --> 00:16:06,073
Everyone knows that, right?

287
00:16:06,113 --> 00:16:09,315
And so now every Tuesday, like 900 Kickstarters launch.

288
00:16:09,996 --> 00:16:10,676
And where's yours?

289
00:16:10,796 --> 00:16:11,577
It's in there, right?

290
00:16:11,637 --> 00:16:12,477
Like, it's in, it's,

291
00:16:12,978 --> 00:16:14,499
unless people are getting that in their feed,

292
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:16,940
it's much, it's challenging for them to see it.

293
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:24,983
And, you know, with all of these rules, with all these new setups where it's like play, you know, Kickstarter backers now demand, like,

294
00:16:25,243 --> 00:16:29,308
we want to see a gameplay video. We want to see reviews ahead of time. You should send it out to all these reviewers.

295
00:16:29,368 --> 00:16:33,533
We want to see, and which means you have to make prototypes for every reviewer before the game is done.

296
00:16:33,974 --> 00:16:38,239
We want to see how the game looks. We want to see near-final artwork on this Kickstarter, like.

297
00:16:38,739 --> 00:16:48,549
Used to be you could run a kick starter with like a couple of our pieces and a really good game idea and you know be really earnest right when I did the bargain quest kick starter originally.

298
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:57,238
One of the piece of advice I got was like hey do the video yourself like do you have to have you know use your laptop camera or whatever and just sort of.

299
00:16:57,598 --> 00:16:59,259
talk about your game and what you're trying to do.

300
00:16:59,759 --> 00:17:02,060
And that really worked, that worked alright at the time.

301
00:17:02,481 --> 00:17:06,883
But these days, people want trailers for their board games,

302
00:17:07,003 --> 00:17:08,744
for them to do crazy money.

303
00:17:08,784 --> 00:17:11,025
They see a human face, like, who's this? What is this?

304
00:17:11,345 --> 00:17:12,706
This doesn't seem professional at all.

305
00:17:13,947 --> 00:17:16,008
Which is a weird expectation to have for Kickstarter,

306
00:17:16,028 --> 00:17:17,969
but it's one people are increasingly having.

307
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:18,589
Yeah.

308
00:17:19,210 --> 00:17:22,833
and they're becoming a lot less tolerant of mistakes along that road as well.

309
00:17:22,853 --> 00:17:24,855
If you, you know, they're like,

310
00:17:25,435 --> 00:17:26,956
all these Kickstarters have already happened,

311
00:17:27,096 --> 00:17:31,620
and clearly we expect you to operate as good as the best Kickstarter.

312
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,044
And I would say, I mean, first of all, that doesn't sound like the work of a single person anymore.

313
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:40,686
And secondly, I mean, what was it Simon said, was it the end of last year?

314
00:17:41,247 --> 00:17:46,289
I mean, they've had apparently all this Kickstarter success, but maybe the profits aren't quite there

315
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:50,571
because they are investing so much money in this marketing and making what they are.

316
00:17:51,812 --> 00:17:56,154
The creator of Scythe posted like a really wonderful series of articles about,

317
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:59,496
like you can look at the Stonemaier Games website, but they posted a series of articles about like...

318
00:18:00,394 --> 00:18:02,976
why I don't put my games on Kickstarter anymore, right?

319
00:18:03,016 --> 00:18:05,357
Like, why the platform no longer works for my model.

320
00:18:05,677 --> 00:18:07,058
But they also posted a series that were like,

321
00:18:07,338 --> 00:18:08,559
but if I did make a Kickstarter,

322
00:18:08,839 --> 00:18:09,880
here's how I would do it now.

323
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,721
And they were, and then by the end of it,

324
00:18:11,741 --> 00:18:13,121
they were like, okay, maybe we'll do another one

325
00:18:13,141 --> 00:18:14,862
because they have, but you know,

326
00:18:14,882 --> 00:18:16,483
they have to play the game super differently.

327
00:18:17,202 --> 00:18:21,064
And it's a really intimidating prospect for new designers, but I mean, I wouldn't necessarily

328
00:18:21,124 --> 00:18:26,927
say don't go for it, but there are community expectations that like might need to be researched

329
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:29,769
and you need to set your expectations, right?

330
00:18:29,789 --> 00:18:35,012
Like you can't expect to make Gloomhaven money every time, you know?

331
00:18:35,352 --> 00:18:39,735
But fans will expect you to deliver Gloomhaven quality correspondence and Gloomhaven quality

332
00:18:40,095 --> 00:18:45,078
like graphic design or what have you like a lot and it can be intimidating.

333
00:18:46,568 --> 00:18:47,910
being that available to fans.

334
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:49,331
There was a really good talk earlier today

335
00:18:49,371 --> 00:18:50,712
by the people who made Dream Daddy

336
00:18:50,993 --> 00:18:53,655
about being constantly available,

337
00:18:53,675 --> 00:18:55,758
which is a thing people don't think about about Kickstarter.

338
00:18:56,198 --> 00:18:57,319
Sorry, I'm starting to ramble a bit.

339
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,722
But when you run a Kickstarter,

340
00:19:00,022 --> 00:19:02,584
you are also on the hook to correspond

341
00:19:02,604 --> 00:19:05,127
with every commenter, every single person

342
00:19:05,147 --> 00:19:06,969
who has an idea about your game

343
00:19:06,989 --> 00:19:08,270
or has an opinion about your game.

344
00:19:09,168 --> 00:19:16,093
And if you go quiet for like more than 48 hours during a Kickstarter, people start to ask questions and get upset.

345
00:19:16,553 --> 00:19:17,914
And that is stressful.

346
00:19:18,234 --> 00:19:24,839
Generally, if you manage social media for a popular brand, or what becomes a popular brand, which isn't always even in your control.

347
00:19:25,479 --> 00:19:30,783
Based on this then, I mean, I would like to ask all the panel, how did you personally start?

348
00:19:31,143 --> 00:19:32,884
Where did your initial success come from?

349
00:19:32,944 --> 00:19:34,886
And based on that, what advice do you have for...

350
00:19:35,466 --> 00:19:41,008
you know, future aspiring designers, how do they become a success now that everything is constantly changing?

351
00:19:44,829 --> 00:19:48,510
Okay, well, so, I mean, my start in the industry was incredibly orthodox, right?

352
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:54,612
Like, I applied for Fantasy Flight Games' game design position for an associate game designer.

353
00:19:55,052 --> 00:19:58,533
And, you know, that application was very much, it felt like applying to college, right?

354
00:19:58,573 --> 00:20:00,354
It's like, here's, you know, an essay section, and here...

355
00:20:00,794 --> 00:20:02,455
like write the rules to rock, paper, scissors,

356
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:05,775
that sort of stuff, and then standard interview,

357
00:20:05,835 --> 00:20:08,076
and then I was in a salaried game design position

358
00:20:08,116 --> 00:20:10,157
for a while, which is really not a job that exists.

359
00:20:10,617 --> 00:20:14,098
I mean, it does, but it's not one that is readily available.

360
00:20:14,238 --> 00:20:16,098
It is a hard job to find, and most companies

361
00:20:16,298 --> 00:20:18,979
don't keep game designers on staff in that way.

362
00:20:20,779 --> 00:20:24,320
From there, after I was at FFG for several years, and then I

363
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:29,612
left to go independent, partly at the behest of Tim Fowers,

364
00:20:30,393 --> 00:20:34,300
who has had a lot of success with Kickstarter,

365
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,062
with a lot of these things.

366
00:20:37,373 --> 00:20:43,756
I think for any new designer, I think definitely reach out to creators that you know and that

367
00:20:43,796 --> 00:20:49,479
you like who have products similar to yours because the industry is still kind of young

368
00:20:49,599 --> 00:20:53,181
and it's still not like super, it's not so crazy.

369
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:57,443
Like Tim is so excited when new designers want to talk to him and he will answer any

370
00:20:57,503 --> 00:20:58,324
question that you have.

371
00:20:59,244 --> 00:21:04,107
I mean same here, just feel free to reach out to me on Twitter or whatever, but like most designers that you know

372
00:21:05,668 --> 00:21:10,771
will be thrilled to talk about how they're doing and like give you advice and give you suggestions about what's

373
00:21:11,532 --> 00:21:13,253
You know what worked for them

374
00:21:14,414 --> 00:21:17,536
Because we want this industry to grow and want you know kind of to see

375
00:21:19,377 --> 00:21:21,758
One of the big things though is that we are not always publishers.

376
00:21:21,778 --> 00:21:22,979
I get a lot of people who message me and say,

377
00:21:23,019 --> 00:21:25,381
hey, I have this game idea and I'm like, I'm not a publisher.

378
00:21:26,482 --> 00:21:28,423
That sounds like a great idea, but like, or like,

379
00:21:28,563 --> 00:21:33,967
I probably shouldn't look at it legally, but like, don't do that, right?

380
00:21:34,047 --> 00:21:36,649
But you can reach out for advice on like, you know,

381
00:21:36,669 --> 00:21:38,410
so what did you do when you were running your Kickstarter?

382
00:21:38,851 --> 00:21:40,292
Are there any things I might want to avoid?

383
00:21:40,392 --> 00:21:42,433
And some of them will be too busy to answer you,

384
00:21:42,453 --> 00:21:45,796
but some of them will be thrilled to, you know, to talk and to...

385
00:21:46,697 --> 00:21:49,019
give you advice of like pitfalls to avoid.

386
00:21:49,259 --> 00:21:53,743
So, based on that, would you recommend the orthodox approach if you apply to a large company

387
00:21:53,943 --> 00:21:55,764
and sort of cut your teeth there?

388
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:58,006
Uh, I...

389
00:21:59,147 --> 00:22:01,549
For me, I was very privileged. I was in a...

390
00:22:01,789 --> 00:22:06,133
I had some amount of savings saved up that I was able to say, move to Minnesota from California,

391
00:22:06,873 --> 00:22:08,274
which is not something everyone could have done.

392
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:12,257
Also, I know at Fantasy Flight they also offer an internship

393
00:22:12,337 --> 00:22:14,219
and several of their employees were former interns.

394
00:22:14,599 --> 00:22:17,620
But that internship was not a paid internship.

395
00:22:18,720 --> 00:22:20,781
It was like they work very hard to,

396
00:22:20,901 --> 00:22:22,921
we work very hard to teach the interns

397
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:25,202
and like to give them a valuable experience,

398
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:27,002
but it's not a paid position.

399
00:22:27,762 --> 00:22:29,663
And so only the people who could do that

400
00:22:29,703 --> 00:22:31,403
were people who could afford to basically take

401
00:22:31,443 --> 00:22:35,584
like three months to just come into a studio every day

402
00:22:35,624 --> 00:22:36,824
and just kind of learn, right?

403
00:22:36,864 --> 00:22:38,325
Like it's almost like going to school.

404
00:22:39,045 --> 00:22:44,128
I think absolutely when you see these job openings, you can't lose anything by applying,

405
00:22:44,168 --> 00:22:47,569
and half of the applications are really good exercises.

406
00:22:47,589 --> 00:22:53,332
Write the rules to rock, paper, scissors coherently is a great thing to do.

407
00:22:53,633 --> 00:22:58,595
Even if I had never gotten the job, it helped me in my technical writing.

408
00:22:58,895 --> 00:23:01,937
So Susan, is that the best way to become a games designer?

409
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:03,573
I have no idea.

410
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:10,000
My own experience was I knew I wanted to create something

411
00:23:10,020 --> 00:23:11,922
and you were asking why be a game designer earlier

412
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:14,205
and it's because you have to make something.

413
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:16,527
You're just driven, you're compelled,

414
00:23:16,627 --> 00:23:17,588
you wake up in the middle of the night

415
00:23:17,608 --> 00:23:18,269
and you think about it.

416
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:20,732
That's the reason you become a novelist

417
00:23:20,792 --> 00:23:22,854
or you design jewelry or wallpaper or anything.

418
00:23:22,874 --> 00:23:24,356
You're just compelled.

419
00:23:25,636 --> 00:23:33,360
And so I knew I wanted to design something but I didn't know what and I worked at a toy and game company and they gave me the opportunity to turn in ideas and I went a little overboard and turned in 200 ideas.

420
00:23:33,921 --> 00:23:37,802
And they said, okay, we're going to move you to the product development department and teach you how to do this.

421
00:23:38,783 --> 00:23:43,145
I was super lucky. I was at the toy and game company because I wanted to make something and they made things.

422
00:23:44,967 --> 00:23:48,911
And then when I started, they moved out of the area and I was looking for another job

423
00:23:48,971 --> 00:23:52,234
and I couldn't find anything I liked as much and my husband encouraged me to start my own

424
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:52,674
company.

425
00:23:52,694 --> 00:23:58,840
I had the blessing and the privilege of having a partner who had a full-time job in insurance

426
00:23:58,900 --> 00:24:04,706
and I could start a company with the ability to fail and that was a great gift that not

427
00:24:04,746 --> 00:24:05,527
everybody has.

428
00:24:06,828 --> 00:24:11,531
But I started in toys and toys have in-house designers.

429
00:24:11,591 --> 00:24:13,312
Toy companies design things in-house.

430
00:24:13,332 --> 00:24:15,914
They're much less used to working with out-of-house designers.

431
00:24:16,294 --> 00:24:20,677
When I switched to games, I found game companies are much more open to working with out-of-house

432
00:24:20,717 --> 00:24:21,097
designers.

433
00:24:21,117 --> 00:24:21,978
That's their model.

434
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:25,599
So they're much more approachable, they're much more willing to look at things,

435
00:24:26,019 --> 00:24:29,480
they're much more willing to work with people who don't have as much experience.

436
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:33,381
So it's really, Kickstarter is one way to get in,

437
00:24:33,661 --> 00:24:37,922
but game companies are much more open than a lot of different industries are.

438
00:24:38,642 --> 00:24:42,283
And I think that's a really nice thing about it.

439
00:24:42,383 --> 00:24:43,903
And what you said is true also.

440
00:24:44,444 --> 00:24:47,464
I know many designers who are happy to answer emails

441
00:24:47,564 --> 00:24:49,325
and respond to requests about information.

442
00:24:49,845 --> 00:24:51,245
It's still a very friendly...

443
00:24:52,766 --> 00:24:58,409
friendly industry. And advice, as you're designing games, I try to remember this myself,

444
00:24:58,549 --> 00:25:04,392
write your instructions early and often. You can do yourself no harm by starting to write

445
00:25:04,412 --> 00:25:08,614
instructions as soon as you possibly can. Edit them, stay on top of them, keep them

446
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:12,416
current with your current version of the game. It will just help in the end because instruction

447
00:25:12,456 --> 00:25:16,098
writing is one of the hardest parts of this job. And the sooner you start, the easier

448
00:25:16,118 --> 00:25:16,298
it is.

449
00:25:16,962 --> 00:25:19,963
Can I ask how do you get 200 ideas for games?

450
00:25:20,183 --> 00:25:21,243
I have like two.

451
00:25:21,283 --> 00:25:23,104
They weren't just games, it was toys and games.

452
00:25:23,564 --> 00:25:26,784
So it was 200 different products that I could see

453
00:25:26,824 --> 00:25:29,085
in this company's line and I was young.

454
00:25:30,005 --> 00:25:30,965
I didn't sleep for a month.

455
00:25:31,025 --> 00:25:34,006
I was so excited about having one of these

456
00:25:34,046 --> 00:25:35,366
become an actual product.

457
00:25:36,306 --> 00:25:38,727
I think of those 205 became actual products,

458
00:25:39,147 --> 00:25:40,827
which was not a bad ratio for someone

459
00:25:40,847 --> 00:25:42,228
who had no clue what they were doing.

460
00:25:43,109 --> 00:25:45,933
And I got to work on two of them and turn them into products.

461
00:25:45,973 --> 00:25:47,996
And when you get to hold them in your hand,

462
00:25:48,036 --> 00:25:49,398
you're like, I made this.

463
00:25:49,839 --> 00:25:50,720
It's really exciting.

464
00:25:51,181 --> 00:25:52,522
So Jen, is that the secret?

465
00:25:52,563 --> 00:25:53,003
Don't sleep.

466
00:25:54,793 --> 00:26:00,118
No, I like sleep a lot. I like sleep a lot. Maybe that's why I'm still like, I don't feel like I have

467
00:26:00,819 --> 00:26:07,745
financial stability at the moment in my life. Like I've done a Kickstarter that did very well for most people's expectations of a Kickstarter

468
00:26:07,765 --> 00:26:12,929
but it's not really an appropriate salary. I luckily have a partner who is able to support me

469
00:26:14,110 --> 00:26:14,651
as well, so

470
00:26:17,665 --> 00:26:21,148
Yeah, I kind of come from a digital games background,

471
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:23,149
which also isn't very stable,

472
00:26:23,229 --> 00:26:26,672
but feels a little bit more stable than tabletop games

473
00:26:26,732 --> 00:26:30,175
in terms of being able to have a career or a job in it.

474
00:26:31,196 --> 00:26:32,737
So yeah, I'm not sure what I'm gonna be doing

475
00:26:32,757 --> 00:26:34,539
when I ship my Kickstarter,

476
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,622
because I don't feel like doing another Kickstarter

477
00:26:37,662 --> 00:26:39,483
is gonna be financially viable for me.

478
00:26:40,024 --> 00:26:42,626
Have you found your experience making video games

479
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,988
is something that has transferable skills though?

480
00:26:45,714 --> 00:26:46,894
I mean, yeah, definitely.

481
00:26:46,934 --> 00:26:50,496
I mean, to me, game design for digital and game design

482
00:26:50,596 --> 00:26:52,436
for tabletop are very similar.

483
00:26:52,456 --> 00:26:55,117
And I think even more so for me, making edible games.

484
00:26:55,217 --> 00:26:59,738
Because in most tabletop games, the things that you have on the,

485
00:27:00,318 --> 00:27:01,779
like, you know, the pieces that you have,

486
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:04,840
they're not, like, consumable for many games.

487
00:27:04,880 --> 00:27:06,120
Obviously, there's legacy games.

488
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:09,241
But, like, in digital games, people can destroy stuff

489
00:27:09,281 --> 00:27:10,001
all over the place.

490
00:27:10,101 --> 00:27:12,382
And so because I'm making edible games where stuff is going

491
00:27:12,402 --> 00:27:12,502
to be...

492
00:27:13,363 --> 00:27:18,690
eaten, it's basically destroyed. So my digital games really helped with my design for tabletop.

493
00:27:28,090 --> 00:27:30,914
a topic that has come up on this panel several times now, but it feels

494
00:27:31,755 --> 00:27:34,858
increasingly intense, I would say, over the last year. There's been growing discussion of

495
00:27:35,259 --> 00:27:38,663
cultural appropriation in games, insensitivity in board games,

496
00:27:39,664 --> 00:27:42,267
conflating cultures, poor and offensive

497
00:27:42,747 --> 00:27:44,309
attempts at representation sometimes.

498
00:27:45,150 --> 00:27:47,811
Is this a serious problem in the industry?

499
00:27:47,951 --> 00:27:49,531
Is it something that we need to address?

500
00:27:49,971 --> 00:27:53,733
Last year, I would add, one of our panelists last year,

501
00:27:53,813 --> 00:27:55,633
Anna, was mentioning that she did not

502
00:27:55,713 --> 00:28:00,415
feel that board games was nearly as representative or equitable

503
00:28:00,715 --> 00:28:02,956
as video games for her, having worked in both.

504
00:28:02,976 --> 00:28:06,457
I have a hot take.

505
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:08,658
I have a take on this one.

506
00:28:10,533 --> 00:28:16,881
I definitely agree that tabletop games are not there yet, but I also feel that you kind

507
00:28:16,941 --> 00:28:21,287
of have to be bad at something before you get good at something, and we are currently

508
00:28:22,168 --> 00:28:26,514
bad at a thing, but it is, I think it is still a sign of...

509
00:28:27,375 --> 00:28:32,138
the industry moving towards more games that even try to represent different cultures,

510
00:28:32,219 --> 00:28:38,443
even though they are sometimes failing in their execution or failing in their ability to consult these cultures that they want to show off.

511
00:28:38,523 --> 00:28:44,848
But like, it's kind of... there is an element that I feel like kind of refreshed to see a greater variety of themes than like

512
00:28:46,249 --> 00:28:48,090
Western military history or...

513
00:28:49,377 --> 00:28:54,062
Western military history or Western economic history, but there's so much of it. Yeah, I know right

514
00:28:55,664 --> 00:29:02,051
But you know as we get a greater variety and as we get more themes that are differentiating themselves people are finding like oh, hey

515
00:29:02,111 --> 00:29:02,431
How do I?

516
00:29:03,332 --> 00:29:06,075
Set myself apart. Well, let's start doing things that people haven't done

517
00:29:07,116 --> 00:29:10,079
And then sometimes they'll execute on those things less

518
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:11,821
less than appropriately

519
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:17,579
And I'm really hopeful that the industry will be taking these as learning experiences.

520
00:29:18,461 --> 00:29:23,408
There are a lot of cool websites that are analyzing games via accessibility,

521
00:29:23,468 --> 00:29:28,074
and doing all these things that are gaining a solid traction in the community, which is nice.

522
00:29:30,197 --> 00:29:34,540
I am, I have some nervousness about call out culture

523
00:29:34,560 --> 00:29:36,221
and it's a larger conversation about how

524
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:42,286
internet discourse is done, but I actually feel remarkable,

525
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,667
like I feel more optimistic than I had in the past

526
00:29:44,747 --> 00:29:48,230
that we will get there, although I also feel very strongly

527
00:29:48,270 --> 00:29:52,093
that we are not there, and that we are not doing

528
00:29:52,333 --> 00:29:55,575
as good a job as we can be representing various cultures

529
00:29:55,615 --> 00:29:57,376
and identities and yeah.

530
00:30:00,032 --> 00:30:02,755
I mean, I would say my experience of meeting games designers,

531
00:30:02,815 --> 00:30:05,438
and hanging out with games designers, and interviewing games designers,

532
00:30:05,578 --> 00:30:06,979
is a lot of them look like this.

533
00:30:09,963 --> 00:30:11,384
How do we change that? Can we change that?

534
00:30:16,230 --> 00:30:18,070
Yeah, I mean, I guess some of it's just...

535
00:30:19,171 --> 00:30:21,351
I know sometimes going to board game conventions,

536
00:30:21,411 --> 00:30:23,252
I walk into a room and it's just full...

537
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:25,312
Yeah, I should make sure I talk into this.

538
00:30:26,032 --> 00:30:27,673
Yeah, you go into a board game convention

539
00:30:27,773 --> 00:30:29,853
and it's full of people who I don't...

540
00:30:30,374 --> 00:30:31,754
I'm like, I look at people, I'm like,

541
00:30:31,914 --> 00:30:33,294
I don't know if I identify with you,

542
00:30:33,314 --> 00:30:34,175
I don't know if I'm gonna be able

543
00:30:34,195 --> 00:30:36,455
to have anything in common with you.

544
00:30:37,155 --> 00:30:42,558
And I think there's a lot more of a range of different board game conventions out there

545
00:30:42,598 --> 00:30:47,241
that now are much more inclusive and anybody can turn up.

546
00:30:47,301 --> 00:30:53,464
And I think that helps with the funnel of trying to get more voices in there.

547
00:30:53,524 --> 00:30:59,147
Like, if you're not even able to go to a convention space and feel comfortable playing those games,

548
00:30:59,167 --> 00:31:02,669
then you're probably not going to try to design board games at all.

549
00:31:02,789 --> 00:31:05,111
So I think that's part of the step.

550
00:31:06,889 --> 00:31:15,095
I mean, I think we've discussed that financial stability is very important and there is a cultural element to financial stability.

551
00:31:15,135 --> 00:31:22,581
There are more, you know, wealth gaps, pay gaps, all of these things are true depending on, you know, kind of.

552
00:31:23,287 --> 00:31:25,428
where you exist and that will affect whether or not you can

553
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:28,830
succeed or you feel comfortable attempting to succeed in the industry.

554
00:31:29,331 --> 00:31:33,193
We are, you know, there are people who are doing a lot of work trying to foster

555
00:31:33,353 --> 00:31:34,514
more inclusive behavior among

556
00:31:35,134 --> 00:31:38,096
players which will lead into more inclusive behavior among, you know, within

557
00:31:38,256 --> 00:31:39,877
the design scene as we get more people

558
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:41,758
who are enthusiastic about games in general.

559
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:45,781
I'm very heartened to have found out recently that the winner of the most

560
00:31:45,841 --> 00:31:46,141
recent

561
00:31:46,922 --> 00:31:48,543
the new game, Key Forge, which we had talked about.

562
00:31:48,903 --> 00:31:53,326
their biggest event, the Vault Tour, was won by a female gamer.

563
00:31:54,487 --> 00:31:59,091
And that is not common in competitive card game scenes.

564
00:32:00,072 --> 00:32:03,575
And that's kind of a heartening event to happen, even though it took a while.

565
00:32:05,776 --> 00:32:10,440
But, yeah, I think there are barriers to entry that companies are working on,

566
00:32:11,541 --> 00:32:14,043
and that we as a culture are...

567
00:32:15,633 --> 00:32:19,475
Struggling with and it will take time and it will take people who are in positions of power

568
00:32:22,257 --> 00:32:25,258
Making active decisions and making choices that are like, okay

569
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:26,519
Let's see

570
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:31,342
I want more marginalized voices in my game where I think this game would be more interesting if

571
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:37,505
We can have like this culture represented accurately and we can serve like this either community or this, you know

572
00:32:37,985 --> 00:32:44,269
present this thing that we don't see often effectively and that will usually require a more diverse set of creators like that is

573
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:51,062
I think, you know, we live in a capitalist society, and currently, diversity is kind

574
00:32:51,082 --> 00:32:51,802
of where the money is.

575
00:32:52,022 --> 00:32:56,304
Like, a lot of games that are being produced that have more diverse themes are being, are

576
00:32:56,784 --> 00:32:58,925
being, people are responding very well to those.

577
00:32:59,385 --> 00:33:03,507
You know, we're getting more, even in the digital space, right?

578
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:08,749
Like Overwatch is incredibly diverse with its cast, and not consistently successfully.

579
00:33:08,769 --> 00:33:09,469
There are some issues.

580
00:33:10,150 --> 00:33:17,996
But those characters have really struck a chord in a lot of communities that a competitive

581
00:33:18,056 --> 00:33:20,678
shooter would almost never have hit otherwise.

582
00:33:21,139 --> 00:33:23,220
You don't see Call of Duty showing up on Tumblr.

583
00:33:24,822 --> 00:33:26,623
I mean you do a little bit, but that's a small...

584
00:33:26,843 --> 00:33:28,265
I haven't spent enough time on Tumblr.

585
00:33:28,685 --> 00:33:31,948
We're talking about social spaces or game spaces.

586
00:33:32,028 --> 00:33:34,790
Have all of you spent some time in a board games cafe?

587
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:40,982
How many folks here, quick show of hands, have been to a board game cafe?

588
00:33:41,002 --> 00:33:44,245
Yeah, okay.

589
00:33:46,167 --> 00:33:47,188
This seems to be a growing scene.

590
00:33:47,228 --> 00:33:50,150
This is really only a thing that I started doing over the last couple of years.

591
00:33:51,591 --> 00:33:52,953
Do we think this is going to be permanent?

592
00:33:54,574 --> 00:33:56,295
Do we think it's going to help the industry in general,

593
00:33:56,536 --> 00:34:00,639
help the marketing games, and maybe also help change the atmosphere?

594
00:34:00,699 --> 00:34:05,243
I've enjoyed a lot of board game cafes more than I've enjoyed some conventions I've been to.

595
00:34:07,973 --> 00:34:14,300
I feel like there's, like it feels like often that it's like in one city there is a board

596
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:20,006
game cafe and people are kind of forced to do whatever style of board game cafe that

597
00:34:20,086 --> 00:34:24,011
is. I feel like I've tried to go to a few different board game cafes and some of them

598
00:34:25,125 --> 00:34:31,010
They feel a lot more inclusive in terms of the range of games that they supply to people

599
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,432
and then the sort of events that they throw.

600
00:34:35,373 --> 00:34:38,836
Some of them I think, I mean, the tabletop industry is very broad

601
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:44,820
and it feels like there should be more cafes that are across that broad ability.

602
00:34:44,880 --> 00:34:49,244
So there's some that are for more hardcore people who want to be playing Key Forge or whatever it is,

603
00:34:49,564 --> 00:34:53,827
but then there's some who just want to play with their kids and more casual games.

604
00:34:53,847 --> 00:34:54,508
I would love to see.

605
00:34:55,048 --> 00:34:57,329
you know, them specializing a bit more.

606
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:02,832
Two things. In my own

607
00:35:02,892 --> 00:35:06,994
experience, anecdotal evidence, Quirkle had

608
00:35:07,114 --> 00:35:11,336
a really unique experience in terms of contacting digital media

609
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:14,358
and

610
00:35:14,918 --> 00:35:18,981
board game cafes. My husband Chris was really good at sending

611
00:35:19,021 --> 00:35:22,923
out copies of Quirkle when it first came out. And he sent one to W. Eric Martin who at that point

612
00:35:22,963 --> 00:35:24,183
was running Board Game News.

613
00:35:24,944 --> 00:35:28,486
and he declared Quirkle his game of the year in 2000,

614
00:35:29,266 --> 00:35:30,647
I think 2007, that's when he got it.

615
00:35:31,487 --> 00:35:34,149
And he was really excited about it.

616
00:35:34,169 --> 00:35:36,190
And he had a friend in Germany, Jeffrey Allers,

617
00:35:36,250 --> 00:35:37,671
who said, will you please bring it to Germany?

618
00:35:37,691 --> 00:35:38,772
I want to try it and play it.

619
00:35:39,792 --> 00:35:41,733
We're going to meet up at this board game cafe,

620
00:35:41,753 --> 00:35:44,895
Spiel Weiss, which I think was one of the very first board game cafes.

621
00:35:45,355 --> 00:35:46,336
and I'd really like to play it there.

622
00:35:46,396 --> 00:35:49,196
So Eric brought Quirkle to Germany

623
00:35:49,236 --> 00:35:51,036
and played it with Jeffrey and Michael,

624
00:35:51,056 --> 00:35:53,337
who owns the cafe, and Torsten Gimler,

625
00:35:53,817 --> 00:35:55,197
who is the publisher at Schmichtbill,

626
00:35:55,217 --> 00:35:57,618
and Torsten is the person who ended up licensing Quirkle

627
00:35:57,678 --> 00:35:59,278
for the German publisher.

628
00:35:59,358 --> 00:36:02,739
So for me, and then Quirkle went on to win the Spiel des Jahres,

629
00:36:02,779 --> 00:36:05,099
so for me, board game cafes, super important,

630
00:36:05,159 --> 00:36:08,840
and reaching out to different forms of media

631
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:10,960
and letting them know about your game, super important.

632
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,921
That led very directly to...

633
00:36:13,561 --> 00:36:15,543
to the publisher Quirkle ended up with in Germany.

634
00:36:16,423 --> 00:36:20,226
And also, I think in that case, Quirkle

635
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:22,588
found a stronger foothold among gamers

636
00:36:23,309 --> 00:36:25,290
because we did that outreach than we expected.

637
00:36:25,330 --> 00:36:27,732
I think if we hadn't been reaching out

638
00:36:27,832 --> 00:36:31,716
to different content reviewers sort of people,

639
00:36:32,756 --> 00:36:33,937
Quirkle might not have had that.

640
00:36:36,264 --> 00:36:38,365
might not have found a home among gamers that it did.

641
00:36:38,385 --> 00:36:39,986
It would have just stayed in the family game market

642
00:36:40,006 --> 00:36:41,066
and it spread from there.

643
00:36:41,146 --> 00:36:45,869
So very personal experience of value of board game cafes.

644
00:36:46,869 --> 00:36:47,829
And then the other thing is,

645
00:36:49,430 --> 00:36:51,571
one of the things that I think is super exciting

646
00:36:51,611 --> 00:36:54,733
about games right now is the growing base of gamers

647
00:36:54,813 --> 00:36:57,474
are people who are excited about learning new games.

648
00:36:57,554 --> 00:36:59,175
And I think American gamers for.

649
00:37:01,047 --> 00:37:06,014
a long, long time, I don't know how long, have been afraid of learning games. Families

650
00:37:06,094 --> 00:37:11,161
have played the games that they grew up, you know, parents played Payday or Monopoly or

651
00:37:11,241 --> 00:37:14,846
Scrabble or Parcheesi or Sorry. They played those games growing up.

652
00:37:15,294 --> 00:37:17,396
And when they have kids, they buy the same games

653
00:37:17,476 --> 00:37:18,877
because they don't want to learn new games.

654
00:37:19,897 --> 00:37:23,099
And it's been a huge barrier of entry for American gamers

655
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:24,200
to learn new games.

656
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:27,222
And right now, I think in part because of board game cafes

657
00:37:27,262 --> 00:37:30,464
and in part because of all the videos teaching games,

658
00:37:31,185 --> 00:37:33,686
we're experiencing this spread of people

659
00:37:33,767 --> 00:37:36,688
who like to learn new games, which is totally different

660
00:37:36,729 --> 00:37:37,729
than what we've had before.

661
00:37:38,490 --> 00:37:41,131
And I think there is going to be a driving force,

662
00:37:41,212 --> 00:37:43,193
even though I think we're headed towards a problem

663
00:37:43,213 --> 00:37:44,594
with oversaturation of games.

664
00:37:45,054 --> 00:37:49,738
I think creating people who think learning games is fun is going to change our market

665
00:37:49,798 --> 00:37:50,298
entirely.

666
00:37:51,219 --> 00:37:55,302
People who think that it's fun to try something new and introduce their friends to it and

667
00:37:55,322 --> 00:37:58,144
they're going to do it at board game cafes and they're going to do it by watching videos

668
00:37:58,164 --> 00:37:59,165
and learning games that way.

669
00:37:59,725 --> 00:38:03,168
I think that's a really strong force in our market right now.

670
00:38:03,593 --> 00:38:07,638
I think that's a really interesting point. Do we think that digital content creators

671
00:38:08,238 --> 00:38:12,563
are part of the reason that the hobbies exploded so much? Because there's now so much learn

672
00:38:12,583 --> 00:38:18,409
to play stuff. There's so much in terms of board game reviews on the internet. And when

673
00:38:18,449 --> 00:38:21,752
people speak to me about discovering a board game, they often say, I didn't see it in a

674
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:26,457
shop. I definitely didn't see an ad for it anywhere. I watched a review of it or something

675
00:38:26,497 --> 00:38:27,298
like that on YouTube.

676
00:38:28,676 --> 00:38:33,458
I think definitely similarly on Kickstarter people are also courting content creators

677
00:38:33,558 --> 00:38:36,500
to like get the word out about their games and I think part of that is just

678
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,743
because the internet is, it is the most powerful like marketing tool anyone can have

679
00:38:43,403 --> 00:38:46,645
and YouTube is huge, right, Twitter is enormous and those,

680
00:38:47,585 --> 00:38:51,027
like as those tools get more powerful, like everyone wants to use those

681
00:38:51,067 --> 00:38:53,989
to market whatever their product is whether it's board games or anything else

682
00:38:54,029 --> 00:38:55,810
and so we are seeing a benefit from that.

683
00:38:57,603 --> 00:39:02,187
There are even some concerns about like, you know, oh, if I want to learn to play this game, I'm not going to go to my local board game shop.

684
00:39:02,327 --> 00:39:09,512
I might just go on YouTube and see a really excellent, very concise how to play video that I won't have to like drive downtown to enjoy.

685
00:39:09,532 --> 00:39:10,413
Yeah.

686
00:39:11,054 --> 00:39:21,462
And like, I think definitely we're seeing a lot of that in the fact that new designers are often trying to court those people with those audiences, right?

687
00:39:21,922 --> 00:39:22,242
Because...

688
00:39:22,983 --> 00:39:28,167
We can't afford, like a lot of us, you know, creators, we can't afford a huge marketing budget, right?

689
00:39:28,187 --> 00:39:30,028
We're not going to put up a billboard in Times Square.

690
00:39:30,749 --> 00:39:34,872
But we can reach out to someone with a very good following and be like, hey, here's a copy of our game.

691
00:39:36,213 --> 00:39:39,875
If you, you know, you are looking, they are often looking for content to cover.

692
00:39:40,954 --> 00:39:45,878
And if they enjoy your game, maybe they'll put out a piece of content that people will

693
00:39:45,918 --> 00:39:48,040
hopefully enjoy and then they'll spread the word.

694
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:53,484
It's sort of a nice symbiotic relationship, theoretically, between developers and digital

695
00:39:53,505 --> 00:39:54,185
content creators.

696
00:39:56,207 --> 00:39:59,910
I think certainly that is probably going to become more and more of the status quo.

697
00:40:01,353 --> 00:40:07,495
particularly as apparently we as a society get more and more into these digital celebrities,

698
00:40:07,575 --> 00:40:09,636
right, like Twitch streamers and YouTubers.

699
00:40:11,958 --> 00:40:15,639
I mean, I'm on the older end of millennials at this point, so I'm not sure.

700
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:21,382
So I hesitate to make any grand predictions about the future of digital technology,

701
00:40:21,922 --> 00:40:29,446
but certainly in the moment it's a very powerful tool that people are working very hard to figure out how to use optimally.

702
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:38,172
Yeah, and I mean with digital content producers we also have, you know, digital production

703
00:40:38,212 --> 00:40:43,117
like Game Crafter and we also have digital distribution like Amazon where people don't

704
00:40:43,137 --> 00:40:45,900
go to their game shop to buy something, they just buy it on Amazon.

705
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:52,206
And I think, I love brick and mortar stores like for the same reason we all have discussed

706
00:40:52,306 --> 00:40:52,426
and I...

707
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:58,422
I am a bit worried because having looked behind the curtain at the economic incentives, you

708
00:40:58,462 --> 00:41:00,203
move so much product on Amazon.

709
00:41:01,143 --> 00:41:03,204
People move so much product.

710
00:41:03,224 --> 00:41:08,366
Honestly, just Amazon is enough to put a lot of places out of business.

711
00:41:10,166 --> 00:41:14,628
And it is only through this diehard dedication.

712
00:41:14,668 --> 00:41:20,230
We are in the same position that bookstores were in when borders collapsed.

713
00:41:21,620 --> 00:41:28,606
And yet, like as we had discussed, book sales, physical book sales are going up this year.

714
00:41:28,646 --> 00:41:32,009
There are more physical books being produced this year than previously,

715
00:41:32,049 --> 00:41:34,331
which is not something I was expecting with the advent of Kindle.

716
00:41:34,912 --> 00:41:37,714
So maybe board game shops will...

717
00:41:38,655 --> 00:41:40,717
I strongly suspect they will survive in some fashion.

718
00:41:41,217 --> 00:41:43,519
I don't know if they'll become huge.

719
00:41:44,608 --> 00:41:48,716
But I don't think Amazon has it in them to kill them at least.

720
00:41:49,077 --> 00:41:51,101
Sorry, I guess I moved back to that previous discussion.

721
00:41:51,582 --> 00:41:53,526
But do you have any thoughts on YouTubers?

722
00:41:55,071 --> 00:42:00,395
I mean, I suddenly noticed, like on my Kickstarter campaign, the influence of like, you know,

723
00:42:00,435 --> 00:42:01,996
shut up and sit down, did a review.

724
00:42:02,116 --> 00:42:05,439
And I think it was like a quarter of my backers came from that.

725
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:10,703
So I can't remember if that's the exact number, but it was a really large number of my backers

726
00:42:10,743 --> 00:42:12,364
came because of that review.

727
00:42:12,865 --> 00:42:17,788
And so like, you know, and I purposefully like I knew they had, you know, I, you know,

728
00:42:17,869 --> 00:42:20,851
quartered basically, because I knew it was important.

729
00:42:20,891 --> 00:42:21,611
And yeah, it was.

730
00:42:22,118 --> 00:42:25,380
I mean this is also assuming that it goes well with that content creator, right?

731
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:26,600
Like a negative review.

732
00:42:27,340 --> 00:42:33,283
Although honestly I've heard like people like a lot of people if like say Tom Vassil posts

733
00:42:33,323 --> 00:42:36,244
like a review like I didn't much care for this particular game but they'll still talk

734
00:42:36,284 --> 00:42:36,544
about it.

735
00:42:36,964 --> 00:42:38,685
That still gets it in front of eyeballs, you know?

736
00:42:38,785 --> 00:42:42,366
A lot of people are like oh I don't like games that Tom likes, maybe I'll like this.

737
00:42:42,986 --> 00:42:46,607
I have found that if you don't like a game on the internet people will correct you and

738
00:42:46,647 --> 00:42:49,068
explain how you're wrong and buy it anyway.

739
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:56,093
Getting into the conversation, it really does seem like that, you know, any news is...

740
00:42:56,673 --> 00:42:58,534
There's no bad news, there's no bad publicity.

741
00:42:58,574 --> 00:43:01,376
Yeah, there's no such thing as bad publicity, which I don't think is true,

742
00:43:01,576 --> 00:43:05,719
but bad publicity can still create positive results.

743
00:43:05,979 --> 00:43:08,180
There's one more thing I'd like to quickly touch on.

744
00:43:08,641 --> 00:43:12,303
We did discuss a bit about counterfeiting board games in the panel last year.

745
00:43:13,864 --> 00:43:18,487
Is that something that has affected any of you this year in any way?

746
00:43:19,921 --> 00:43:20,922
I mean, not really for me.

747
00:43:20,942 --> 00:43:23,403
I mean, I've recently been sending out some of my chapters

748
00:43:23,443 --> 00:43:25,885
to some of my backers who I call play tasters,

749
00:43:25,905 --> 00:43:28,427
because I like them.

750
00:43:28,887 --> 00:43:31,128
And yeah, I mean, I guess particularly

751
00:43:31,148 --> 00:43:32,289
with the sort of games I'm making,

752
00:43:32,309 --> 00:43:33,930
people have to make it at home.

753
00:43:34,010 --> 00:43:35,731
So it's kind of like a print and play game,

754
00:43:35,771 --> 00:43:37,552
but I'm encouraging people to make their own.

755
00:43:37,593 --> 00:43:40,074
So I'm somewhat encouraging people to like counterfeit

756
00:43:40,114 --> 00:43:41,335
and make their own edible games

757
00:43:41,415 --> 00:43:44,217
and maybe adjust my edible games if they don't like them.

758
00:43:44,377 --> 00:43:46,658
So not so much for me.

759
00:43:47,937 --> 00:43:53,800
A few years ago there was quite a spat of knockoff quirkles available on Amazon and

760
00:43:54,240 --> 00:43:55,060
that was interesting.

761
00:43:55,920 --> 00:43:58,901
There was some bad reviews because they were poorly produced and they were selling and

762
00:43:58,921 --> 00:44:02,263
there was no way to tell if you were getting a good copy or a bad copy before you bought

763
00:44:02,303 --> 00:44:02,343
it.

764
00:44:03,023 --> 00:44:05,425
and my publisher worked with Amazon and got those cleaned out,

765
00:44:05,465 --> 00:44:08,046
but the reviews are still there of these bad copies of Korkul.

766
00:44:09,768 --> 00:44:11,889
This is a case where I'm really glad I have a publisher.

767
00:44:11,949 --> 00:44:15,511
They're fighting counterfeits on multiple fronts.

768
00:44:16,532 --> 00:44:20,435
And I know Russia is one country that particularly has a counterfeit problem.

769
00:44:21,715 --> 00:44:24,497
We've had counterfeits in Canada. We've had counterfeits here.

770
00:44:26,379 --> 00:44:34,564
So it's an issue and it's something that as a designer I don't have any idea how one controls it or what to do about it,

771
00:44:34,604 --> 00:44:40,988
but I know it's a growing problem in our industry and can affect lots of different games.

772
00:44:41,498 --> 00:44:45,439
Amazon actually, I believe there's a recent article, Amazon is actively cracking down

773
00:44:45,499 --> 00:44:49,260
on their sellers and they're making it a point to make sure that hey, if you want to sell

774
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:54,121
a game on Amazon you have to be a registered seller and have, they're basically cracking

775
00:44:54,141 --> 00:45:00,123
down on the accountability of people who produce these products and make sure that hey, people

776
00:45:00,163 --> 00:45:08,065
selling these Asmodee titles or whatever have gotten their games from the appropriate channels

777
00:45:08,225 --> 00:45:10,865
in a lot of cases and that otherwise you will, they.

778
00:45:11,806 --> 00:45:19,111
They're categorizing them more and they're sort of cracking down all these little shop fronts which are often fronts for counterfeit games.

779
00:45:19,992 --> 00:45:23,734
And they won't just automatically kind of just bundle them all together and be like,

780
00:45:23,774 --> 00:45:26,256
ah, this is the product and we'll ship them out piecemeal.

781
00:45:27,437 --> 00:45:30,359
Which has been a big, which is probably a big get.

782
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:35,083
And this is probably the best way that we have to fight counterfeiters in that way.

783
00:45:35,663 --> 00:45:38,345
And the more current problem, I think, is it Alibaba?

784
00:45:39,466 --> 00:45:44,390
That's a bigger problem right now, because that is so easily

785
00:45:44,550 --> 00:45:46,032
counterfeit products available there.

786
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,676
So excellent that they're finding out ways to make it

787
00:45:50,716 --> 00:45:52,577
work better on Amazon and crack down on the problem there.

788
00:45:53,778 --> 00:45:56,100
Another way for counterfeiters is broken out.

789
00:45:56,440 --> 00:45:58,402
And I was reading an article that was talking about how

790
00:45:59,343 --> 00:46:04,087
the counterfeiters, they have these fantastic ways

791
00:46:04,187 --> 00:46:06,169
of figuring out what price point they need

792
00:46:06,189 --> 00:46:07,129
to sell the product.

793
00:46:08,090 --> 00:46:09,451
They'll sell the most product,

794
00:46:09,612 --> 00:46:11,153
and they're better at figuring that out

795
00:46:11,213 --> 00:46:12,074
than the publishers.

796
00:46:12,414 --> 00:46:13,995
They've got it worked out so that they can sell it

797
00:46:14,015 --> 00:46:16,537
at that price, and that's what they'll sell the most.

798
00:46:16,597 --> 00:46:17,879
And it's really interesting to me

799
00:46:19,080 --> 00:46:21,622
the amount of work they also put into their products.

800
00:46:22,262 --> 00:46:23,302
Crime is big business.

801
00:46:23,382 --> 00:46:24,123
There you go.

802
00:46:25,003 --> 00:46:25,283
Yeah.

803
00:46:25,923 --> 00:46:29,424
So if anyone has a solution to how we defeat, I don't know,

804
00:46:29,464 --> 00:46:30,444
piracy is not going to go away, is it?

805
00:46:30,464 --> 00:46:31,364
Can someone solve crime for us?

806
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:31,984
Yeah.

807
00:46:32,464 --> 00:46:33,145
Please step up.

808
00:46:33,165 --> 00:46:34,425
We have a microphone that is just

809
00:46:34,485 --> 00:46:36,565
waiting for your questions on anything

810
00:46:36,645 --> 00:46:39,486
that you would like to reach out to the panel for.

811
00:46:39,506 --> 00:46:41,726
Hello.

812
00:46:42,026 --> 00:46:42,386
Hello.

813
00:46:42,486 --> 00:46:42,967
How are you?

814
00:46:42,987 --> 00:46:43,747
Hi, I'm good.

815
00:46:44,587 --> 00:46:48,588
I'm a college professor, and I teach game design.

816
00:46:49,189 --> 00:46:51,150
And one of the experiments I tried to do is I was like,

817
00:46:51,430 --> 00:46:52,691
I'll make my own card game.

818
00:46:53,211 --> 00:46:54,852
I went through Publisher, I went through all that,

819
00:46:54,892 --> 00:46:56,994
and I actually got it published.

820
00:46:58,375 --> 00:46:59,255
Reviewed by Dice Tower.

821
00:46:59,355 --> 00:46:59,896
Congratulations.

822
00:46:59,976 --> 00:47:00,776
Thanks.

823
00:47:00,816 --> 00:47:03,458
Reviewed by Dice Tower twice, made top 10, made GGcon.

824
00:47:04,839 --> 00:47:05,219
How do you, and...

825
00:47:07,167 --> 00:47:10,648
And my game didn't do as well as far as sales are concerned.

826
00:47:11,108 --> 00:47:15,751
But I'm starting to see this trend of all these solid games,

827
00:47:15,831 --> 00:47:19,712
but they just get drowned out by the massive amounts

828
00:47:19,912 --> 00:47:23,234
of other games that are just waving right over.

829
00:47:23,474 --> 00:47:25,855
How do you deal with Cult of the New?

830
00:47:29,935 --> 00:47:35,781
I mean I guess I'd say you've got to like, I think it used to be with tabletop games

831
00:47:35,801 --> 00:47:40,346
you just needed to have a good game to be able to stand out and I think now you've got

832
00:47:40,366 --> 00:47:45,711
to have something that's got a big hook that's not just a good game but it's like just captures

833
00:47:45,751 --> 00:47:49,855
people right, like as soon as they almost hear the title or see the box they're like

834
00:47:49,915 --> 00:47:50,195
ooh.

835
00:47:51,387 --> 00:47:52,487
So I think you've got to do more.

836
00:47:52,687 --> 00:47:55,448
There are absolutely amazing games that slip under the radar

837
00:47:55,568 --> 00:47:57,649
every day, you know, like, I mean.

838
00:47:57,669 --> 00:47:59,030
Yeah, I totally agree.

839
00:47:59,290 --> 00:48:00,911
Yeah, 10, you know, what was it, Paul?

840
00:48:00,931 --> 00:48:04,072
Like 10 new games get made every day, basically.

841
00:48:04,092 --> 00:48:05,833
I think that's Susan having 200 ideas.

842
00:48:08,354 --> 00:48:16,942
That's true. Yeah, I mean, it's hard and if there was a recipe for guaranteed success,

843
00:48:17,362 --> 00:48:20,405
then I don't think we would need conferences like this.

844
00:48:23,307 --> 00:48:27,328
Yeah, I think one of the things is, you know, dedication and it's possible that it's the theme that didn't work.

845
00:48:27,448 --> 00:48:31,449
It's possible that it's, that you didn't have the right marketing push at the time.

846
00:48:31,469 --> 00:48:36,270
But people will start and try and like, you know, print copies, multiple iterations.

847
00:48:36,310 --> 00:48:41,752
I mean, when Bargain Quest first came out, right, we had a very modest Kickstarter success.

848
00:48:41,772 --> 00:48:43,452
I think we printed like 2,000 copies.

849
00:48:44,272 --> 00:48:47,433
And I think it's entirely possible that might have been all we would have ever printed.

850
00:48:48,054 --> 00:49:03,429
If the game didn't, if we, you know, didn't put in a lot of legwork like submitting it to, you know, different shows and like submitting it to different people and like just sort of going places and showing it off and putting in a huge amount of work and even that, we, we, and even then we got lucky, right?

851
00:49:03,469 --> 00:49:04,610
We got, uh...

852
00:49:05,373 --> 00:49:10,655
you know, we got positive reviews from Shut Up, It's Down, which really gave us a huge social media boost.

853
00:49:10,675 --> 00:49:14,296
And that allowed us to kind of move forward, but not everyone has those opportunities.

854
00:49:14,876 --> 00:49:21,758
But I think pursuing them is basically the only move most, particularly small devs, have.

855
00:49:23,919 --> 00:49:31,601
But hey, good games get rethemed, good games get reprinted all the time, like, and, you know, it's not your only shot.

856
00:49:33,202 --> 00:49:33,302
And...

857
00:49:34,580 --> 00:49:44,323
Yeah, all I can say is you should definitely don't give up on it, but it's hard and don't think of it as a personal failing of your game or your product.

858
00:49:45,464 --> 00:49:54,187
Oh no, I've learned a lot. I mean, I've learned that you need a team, there's a lot of dedication. It's insane. But I really appreciate your insight, thank you very much guys.

859
00:49:55,407 --> 00:50:00,749
And based on that Susan, did you know with all these different ideas, did you know Quirkle was going to be the one that would take off?

860
00:50:02,992 --> 00:50:07,757
Quirkle came later when I had my own company and I was designing toys, I wasn't designing

861
00:50:07,817 --> 00:50:13,504
games but I'd been hosting a game night for a very long time and Quirkle came to me in

862
00:50:13,524 --> 00:50:13,924
a dream.

863
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:18,479
almost fully finished and I got up in the morning and said,

864
00:50:18,519 --> 00:50:20,700
that looks really cool, that was really neat in my dream,

865
00:50:20,740 --> 00:50:21,581
I gotta go make that.

866
00:50:22,441 --> 00:50:25,583
So I did and it worked out super well.

867
00:50:26,064 --> 00:50:27,744
And since I was already a toy designer,

868
00:50:27,865 --> 00:50:31,807
I had already pitched to Mindware, the toy company,

869
00:50:31,947 --> 00:50:33,588
and they had turned down a bunch of my toys,

870
00:50:33,628 --> 00:50:35,409
but I was like, yeah, this is gonna fit their line,

871
00:50:35,469 --> 00:50:36,790
I need to send it to them and I did

872
00:50:36,850 --> 00:50:38,891
and they accepted it immediately and went really well.

873
00:50:41,152 --> 00:50:43,894
I did not know Quirkle was going to become so popular.

874
00:50:43,914 --> 00:50:47,155
I had no idea that it would be so well received.

875
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:50,597
I was ready for it to be a middling success.

876
00:50:50,837 --> 00:50:53,278
You know, I thought it was going to do well for a few years

877
00:50:53,639 --> 00:50:55,680
and it just continued.

878
00:50:57,957 --> 00:51:00,961
Continues to grow and thrive and I'm just super bused by it

879
00:51:00,981 --> 00:51:03,525
But I did not know that it was going to be my best-selling product

880
00:51:04,406 --> 00:51:07,952
Wait, you're telling me that you can design award-winning games in your sleep

881
00:51:08,533 --> 00:51:10,015
Literally, I need more naps

882
00:51:10,135 --> 00:51:12,859
Yeah, yes next question

883
00:51:15,028 --> 00:51:21,073
It's rather a commentary. I'm Christophe from rebel game studio. So as money Poland

884
00:51:22,094 --> 00:51:23,735
I just returned from Reno

885
00:51:24,316 --> 00:51:24,896
trade show

886
00:51:25,817 --> 00:51:30,121
Gamma trade show in Reno and what like topics here?

887
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:34,725
Covered were covered two years ago on retail and distribution

888
00:51:35,585 --> 00:51:36,586
conferences yet

889
00:51:38,067 --> 00:51:45,910
In my opinion, what we were talking at GAMA, it's about overabundance, over saturation,

890
00:51:46,190 --> 00:51:50,611
and how to help brick and mortar stores to survive.

891
00:51:51,451 --> 00:51:57,433
And the other topics were consolidation of the market and some companies going under.

892
00:51:58,293 --> 00:52:03,995
Last year was the hardest year for many European publishers and distributors.

893
00:52:04,476 --> 00:52:08,418
So, and probably you know that's a kind of domino effect.

894
00:52:08,799 --> 00:52:17,065
We won't be buying new titles from new developers and game artists if we won't be prospering.

895
00:52:17,345 --> 00:52:22,108
The topic for you here, to understand, I want to share it.

896
00:52:22,328 --> 00:52:26,411
It's not, we are no longer looking for new good games.

897
00:52:26,572 --> 00:52:28,973
We are looking for games that we, that...

898
00:52:29,393 --> 00:52:36,455
that the games that are already evergreens, that have their solid place on the shelves,

899
00:52:37,436 --> 00:52:40,296
that we can put new instead of them.

900
00:52:40,996 --> 00:52:45,118
We are no longer willing to expand our catalogs or portfolio.

901
00:52:45,878 --> 00:52:50,239
That's why these old games are still going strong, because it's for us.

902
00:52:50,759 --> 00:52:55,400
It has better rate of interest to invest in promoting the games that we already have.

903
00:52:56,648 --> 00:53:03,569
than to introduce new ones and start earning money in the next two years or something.

904
00:53:04,290 --> 00:53:10,911
If we solve the problem that's currently on the distribution side, then you probably can

905
00:53:11,031 --> 00:53:16,652
avoid the problems that we are now experiencing.

906
00:53:17,393 --> 00:53:21,053
That's what we are now trying to solve.

907
00:53:21,173 --> 00:53:23,714
So keep on with good work.

908
00:53:23,814 --> 00:53:26,015
But your competition is not only this.

909
00:53:27,475 --> 00:53:33,020
900 games on Kickstarter currently are all all these bestsellers and evergreens

910
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:34,881
that you have to be better than.

911
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:39,545
Yeah, so I think we're down to seven minutes. We should get moving.

912
00:53:40,045 --> 00:53:43,027
Yes, the next speaker, please.

913
00:53:43,568 --> 00:53:43,928
Yes, hi.

914
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:48,592
Just wondering, how do you think that global availability is affecting the hobby?

915
00:53:48,753 --> 00:53:53,836
For example, I'm from South America and it's pretty hard to get most board games that I guess

916
00:53:53,976 --> 00:53:59,480
it's easier to come by either in North America or Europe. So as you're speaking about, you know,

917
00:54:00,060 --> 00:54:05,984
market saturation and how the scene can continue to grow, do you think that there is, you know,

918
00:54:06,164 --> 00:54:11,208
something to be said about that you're not actually serving the whole available population

919
00:54:11,668 --> 00:54:12,388
that is into the hobby?

920
00:54:14,442 --> 00:54:30,635
Yeah, there are absolutely markets that we are not serving actively, partly because distribution can be very difficult in those regions currently and there are other like, you know, broader infrastructure reasons or a lot of publishers don't want to be the first one to dive in and invest heavily and take a risk in a region that

921
00:54:31,654 --> 00:54:37,597
isn't proven, right? As things get bigger, people become more risk-averse. I think this is

922
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:42,960
possibly a big advantage to things like print and play, so that we can get more and more easily

923
00:54:43,020 --> 00:54:48,422
accessible games in those kinds of regions. But yeah, it's hard, particularly when you're running

924
00:54:48,462 --> 00:54:53,885
a physical product that requires things like translation and physical shipping of a 2kg box.

925
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:57,426
Can I just say, I don't know if it's just that.

926
00:54:57,466 --> 00:55:00,467
Like I grew up in Australia, and sure I haven't lived in Australia for a while,

927
00:55:00,507 --> 00:55:02,668
and board games have got a lot more popular since I've left,

928
00:55:02,768 --> 00:55:04,928
but they were very expensive in Australia.

929
00:55:05,009 --> 00:55:07,629
Australia speaks the same language as in the US,

930
00:55:08,029 --> 00:55:10,750
it's quite a similar culture, like sure Australia's different,

931
00:55:10,830 --> 00:55:13,471
but even so it was very expensive to get.

932
00:55:13,551 --> 00:55:16,992
So I think there must be more than just transport and the things,

933
00:55:17,292 --> 00:55:20,653
I mean, I assume Australia's getting better, but it's still really difficult.

934
00:55:21,704 --> 00:55:24,705
There's also just taxes based on governments, right?

935
00:55:24,745 --> 00:55:28,125
Like being able to figure out, OK, what are the import taxes for this region?

936
00:55:28,406 --> 00:55:33,967
And yeah, some smaller publishers just don't have the bandwidth

937
00:55:34,007 --> 00:55:40,748
to be able to run the import taxes for every single country, which

938
00:55:40,808 --> 00:55:43,769
is unfortunate, but will hopefully get better as the industry gets

939
00:55:43,969 --> 00:55:44,809
bigger and more successful.

940
00:55:46,307 --> 00:55:51,088
And there's the problems of you can't just sell to one store in a country.

941
00:55:51,968 --> 00:55:54,209
You need a base.

942
00:55:54,369 --> 00:55:58,590
So usually you need a partner in that country who has a distribution channel

943
00:55:58,870 --> 00:56:00,630
and can sell it to a lot of stores.

944
00:56:01,110 --> 00:56:04,791
So it's a real investment each country you move into

945
00:56:04,911 --> 00:56:07,052
finding someone you can work with and figuring out

946
00:56:07,952 --> 00:56:09,732
how you're going to sell your container of games

947
00:56:09,772 --> 00:56:13,413
that's going to be specific to that market and going to be shipped there.

948
00:56:14,234 --> 00:56:18,758
Who is going to take those games? You can't just do a print run of a thousand for them

949
00:56:18,798 --> 00:56:22,021
they're going to take a print run of 10,000 in a container and

950
00:56:22,201 --> 00:56:24,683
You need a partner who's going to help you get through all those so it's

951
00:56:25,844 --> 00:56:30,729
Unfortunately it makes it so much harder to move into different countries because of that

952
00:56:31,710 --> 00:56:36,975
Less hard than it used to be but still it's a real challenge. I think we have time for maybe one more question

953
00:56:39,166 --> 00:56:41,348
I hope this is worthy of being the last question, but I'll try.

954
00:56:42,590 --> 00:56:45,894
We're starting to see a trend in bigger retailers of doing

955
00:56:45,994 --> 00:56:47,275
exclusive games for them.

956
00:56:47,295 --> 00:56:49,978
Walmart was the exclusive distributor of Fog of Love.

957
00:56:50,058 --> 00:56:51,680
Target has a couple of games that are only

958
00:56:51,720 --> 00:56:52,421
available through them.

959
00:56:53,822 --> 00:56:56,906
Do you think this is a positive thing for the industry?

960
00:56:56,926 --> 00:56:57,767
Do you think it's a negative?

961
00:56:57,787 --> 00:56:59,108
Do you think it's just a flash in the pan?

962
00:56:59,554 --> 00:57:02,896
Can I immediately say, speaking as a chap who lived in Vancouver for quite a while,

963
00:57:02,936 --> 00:57:07,659
when something's available in Target, which is not even in your country, that's quite

964
00:57:07,699 --> 00:57:08,340
frustrating.

965
00:57:09,620 --> 00:57:14,243
I think it's absolutely a positive sign that, like, these, you know, cap-giant monoliths

966
00:57:14,323 --> 00:57:17,906
think that games are valuable enough, that they want to have exclusivity of certain products

967
00:57:17,926 --> 00:57:21,428
like this, that they think that they want to, that that is a valuable thing, it's a

968
00:57:21,468 --> 00:57:22,008
good sign.

969
00:57:22,429 --> 00:57:27,132
I do think it's bad for all of the accessibility reasons that we've mentioned, you know, leading

970
00:57:27,172 --> 00:57:27,752
into this, right?

971
00:57:29,193 --> 00:57:31,715
a game being exclusive to only one kind of store

972
00:57:31,755 --> 00:57:33,416
means it's harder for people who don't have access

973
00:57:33,436 --> 00:57:37,980
to that kind of store, or people who have ethical issues

974
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:40,101
with, say, how certain stores run themselves,

975
00:57:40,221 --> 00:57:40,862
or what have you.

976
00:57:41,282 --> 00:57:43,464
Well, and the industry as a whole is balancing

977
00:57:43,524 --> 00:57:46,206
between the friendly local game store,

978
00:57:46,226 --> 00:57:48,708
the specialty store that is supporting

979
00:57:48,748 --> 00:57:50,129
and growing the game in the beginning,

980
00:57:50,309 --> 00:57:55,513
and then Target can come in and take that popular game

981
00:57:55,553 --> 00:57:57,174
and make it available on a much wider market.

982
00:57:57,807 --> 00:58:00,549
but they didn't necessarily do the work of building that.

983
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:03,691
So as a publisher, you have to struggle

984
00:58:03,751 --> 00:58:07,934
with these two different competing merchants you're

985
00:58:07,954 --> 00:58:10,736
dealing with, the specialty market and the mass market,

986
00:58:11,157 --> 00:58:13,358
and how to service them both and honor both of them

987
00:58:13,398 --> 00:58:16,261
for the different things they provide for your game.

988
00:58:16,341 --> 00:58:22,946
So exclusives in Target are a tricky, interesting, positive

989
00:58:23,006 --> 00:58:24,727
sign, but not necessarily.

990
00:58:25,571 --> 00:58:27,433
the best way to... I don't know. There you go.

991
00:58:38,198 --> 00:58:40,780
And I know that actually happens a lot with the Target exclusive.

992
00:58:40,820 --> 00:58:42,302
I know less about the Walmart exclusives.

993
00:58:42,342 --> 00:58:46,185
I know that they are often limited time, and then they become available on a wider basis.

994
00:58:46,385 --> 00:58:51,490
Yeah. To put it on the recording, yeah, some publishers will give exclusivity for a short

995
00:58:51,530 --> 00:58:53,832
time before letting that run.

996
00:58:53,872 --> 00:58:55,834
But that's also a big contract issue, right?

997
00:58:55,854 --> 00:59:01,059
Like, as a designer, oftentimes I may not get a say in whether a game goes exclusive to one

998
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:03,921
company or another, because that's a business decision, right?

999
00:59:05,002 --> 00:59:09,184
And, yeah, how long that exclusivity lasts is a huge component.

1000
00:59:09,364 --> 00:59:14,346
And, yeah, I think, I don't know, personally I'm not crazy about it,

1001
00:59:14,386 --> 00:59:17,168
just because I want everyone to play all of the games.

1002
00:59:18,528 --> 00:59:23,270
But, yeah, it is, we live in a society with market forces,

1003
00:59:23,290 --> 00:59:26,192
and that is how, if that is how they want, if that is how they will carry the game,

1004
00:59:26,232 --> 00:59:27,532
that is how they'll carry it, you know.

1005
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,653
That's just, we play ball.

1006
00:59:32,090 --> 00:59:37,694
I think we have about half a minute left, so I just want to say thank you so much to

1007
00:59:37,714 --> 00:59:40,456
my panelists for agreeing to appear this evening.

1008
00:59:40,496 --> 00:59:41,296
You have been terrific.

1009
00:59:41,617 --> 00:59:44,799
Thank you, all of you, also, for coming and for your questions.

1010
00:59:45,899 --> 00:59:49,622
I should mention that this talk and all the previous ones are available online in the

1011
00:59:49,662 --> 00:59:53,324
GDC Vault or on YouTube where you can leave comments, where you can tell us what you think

1012
00:59:53,364 --> 00:59:54,425
about them, which is always helpful.

1013
00:59:56,227 --> 00:59:59,191
But more importantly on that topic, I am always told every year,

1014
00:59:59,672 --> 01:00:02,315
please fill in your evaluation forms, tell us what you thought,

1015
01:00:02,395 --> 01:00:04,598
tell us what you liked, tell us who you're excited about,

1016
01:00:04,879 --> 01:00:09,665
because that feedback is incredibly useful and it guides us to what we do next year.

1017
01:00:10,226 --> 01:00:11,568
Thank you very much, panelists.
