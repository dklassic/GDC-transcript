1
00:00:06,784 --> 00:00:12,726
I'm here, well I'm Richard, I'm here from the UK, I'm going to talk about my game Kitty

2
00:00:12,766 --> 00:00:26,111
Power's Matchmaker, which you may have seen. Let me start my slideshow. Oops, shouldn't

3
00:00:26,151 --> 00:00:33,274
be there. That's better. So I'm going to try and come in a little bit early so people can

4
00:00:33,294 --> 00:00:34,234
ask questions at the end.

5
00:00:36,181 --> 00:00:37,461
I'll try not to waffle too much.

6
00:00:38,781 --> 00:00:40,102
So I've been making games since 1996.

7
00:00:41,942 --> 00:00:45,823
And all that time, it's been my personal holy grail

8
00:00:46,383 --> 00:00:48,723
to make a game that was an expression of everything

9
00:00:48,743 --> 00:00:52,224
I love as possible, just like every other game designer

10
00:00:52,264 --> 00:00:52,524
I know.

11
00:00:52,544 --> 00:00:56,665
A game that I could direct and not

12
00:00:56,705 --> 00:00:57,925
have to answer to anybody else.

13
00:00:57,945 --> 00:01:01,425
A game that my audience could play and get a real clear

14
00:01:01,485 --> 00:01:03,846
insight into what I have to say as a designer.

15
00:01:05,370 --> 00:01:09,952
and something unique that might add a new color to the rainbow of video games.

16
00:01:13,814 --> 00:01:17,616
A couple of years ago I finally found myself with the chance to make that dream happen.

17
00:01:18,537 --> 00:01:25,020
I left a well-paid job in AAA games after 10 years with enough cash to start something up.

18
00:01:25,900 --> 00:01:31,763
And a friend and now ex-colleague had recommended a graduate programmer to me

19
00:01:31,823 --> 00:01:34,625
who was very keen to get into the games industry.

20
00:01:36,454 --> 00:01:42,557
I've seen success and failures, so I was conservative in my approach to this new venture.

21
00:01:43,498 --> 00:01:48,021
So I got a contract job at Media Molecule, working on the fabulous Tearaway.

22
00:01:49,401 --> 00:01:52,503
The contract really allowed me the freedom to work on my own projects

23
00:01:53,084 --> 00:01:56,966
without the fear of the dreaded conflict of interest clause.

24
00:01:59,627 --> 00:02:03,009
Working during the day gave me enough income to pay a full-time

25
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:04,811
legislating programmer and myself.

26
00:02:05,814 --> 00:02:12,346
Enough to save for other contractors later on, like audio designers and artists and those kind of people.

27
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:18,357
And enough security to not have to worry about anything other than making a good game, which is kind of what you want really.

28
00:02:21,754 --> 00:02:24,756
So I challenged myself to go against the grain of death,

29
00:02:24,956 --> 00:02:28,097
destruction, and zombies that you tend to find in most games.

30
00:02:30,198 --> 00:02:32,999
I had, after all, spent decades making driving and

31
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:35,621
shooting games about destroying people, cars, and

32
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,363
buildings. I wanted to see if I could create a game about

33
00:02:40,423 --> 00:02:43,985
love, social interactions, and relationships, but with my own

34
00:02:44,085 --> 00:02:45,165
stupid sense of humor.

35
00:02:49,871 --> 00:02:53,134
And there is no better way to represent my stupid sense of humor

36
00:02:54,134 --> 00:02:56,356
than my alter ego, Kitty Powers.

37
00:02:57,677 --> 00:02:58,438
You can see there.

38
00:02:59,479 --> 00:03:02,681
I'd been doing drag in my spare time for about five years

39
00:03:03,081 --> 00:03:05,884
and I wanted an opportunity to take it to the next level.

40
00:03:06,504 --> 00:03:08,426
So I decided to put her in the game, but

41
00:03:09,146 --> 00:03:11,848
I wanted to make her presence meaningful.

42
00:03:11,868 --> 00:03:13,730
Um...

43
00:03:15,511 --> 00:03:18,193
What kind of game did I think Kitty would fit well into?

44
00:03:19,286 --> 00:03:23,610
What I needed was a brief. No, not that kind of brief, Kitty.

45
00:03:24,611 --> 00:03:27,133
A kind of checklist of all the things I wanted it to be.

46
00:03:29,275 --> 00:03:32,577
So I didn't want any violence or destruction, but love and baby-making.

47
00:03:33,818 --> 00:03:35,780
Procedural systems, because I love them.

48
00:03:36,221 --> 00:03:41,905
Procedural characters with real humanity that would feel like they'd been designed,

49
00:03:42,786 --> 00:03:44,067
rather than randomly generated.

50
00:03:44,788 --> 00:03:47,210
People that you'd want to help and not shoot in the face.

51
00:03:48,413 --> 00:03:53,215
I wanted a very English sense of humor because that's what I know best. Despite the pressure to

52
00:03:53,255 --> 00:03:59,396
Americanize it, my argument against that being that the best British comedy such as Monty

53
00:03:59,416 --> 00:04:04,857
Python and Ab Fab, etc. didn't need to be Americanized for people to get it. And I wanted it

54
00:04:04,937 --> 00:04:09,799
to be a premium product with no in-app purchases like The Room, which is also made in

55
00:04:09,839 --> 00:04:16,600
Guilford. So after all that, it seemed pretty clear to me that I was going to be

56
00:04:16,855 --> 00:04:23,058
We'd make a dating agency simulator with Kitty Powers as your host. It would be so easy. We'd

57
00:04:23,078 --> 00:04:28,961
just make a game similar to Guess Who, but without the demonic children. But where you're

58
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:33,944
matching procedural clients with potential dates and then seeing how it all panned out in

59
00:04:34,024 --> 00:04:40,947
excruciating detail. And Kitty Powers would be your boss. On hand to be sarcastic and

60
00:04:41,007 --> 00:04:45,590
saucy at every opportunity. It would be easy and sell millions, or so we thought.

61
00:04:47,777 --> 00:04:53,818
So before we get into some detail, here's the launch trailer of the game to give you a taste of the flavour.

62
00:04:54,578 --> 00:05:00,559
OMG, put your hands together for Miss Kitty Powers!

63
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:05,941
Ooh, hello kittens. I'm Kitty Powers, matchmaker extraordinaire.

64
00:05:06,481 --> 00:05:15,363
As we all know, the path to true love is long and hard, which is why I created my new dating simulator, Kitty Powers Matchmaker.

65
00:05:16,767 --> 00:05:20,809
I've got a little black book full of lonely hearts.

66
00:05:21,569 --> 00:05:23,450
This is your job to find them love.

67
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:30,573
Help them through delicate dating dilemmas.

68
00:05:30,593 --> 00:05:33,435
Guide their passage through the turbulent tunnel of love.

69
00:05:35,055 --> 00:05:35,676
Outrageous!

70
00:05:38,497 --> 00:05:40,498
Hello Kitty Powers Dating Agency.

71
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:45,060
You can even match-mate your mates and send them on dates.

72
00:05:46,077 --> 00:05:50,099
Will they end up in the penthouse of passion, or the dustbin of broken dreams?

73
00:05:53,320 --> 00:06:00,484
Sounds scary, doesn't it? But don't despair, kittens, because I, Kitty Powers, will be there for you every step of the way.

74
00:06:01,624 --> 00:06:06,167
Every client deserves their happy ending, and it's your job to give them one.

75
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,068
Coming soon, kittens.

76
00:06:13,557 --> 00:06:14,137
There she is.

77
00:06:14,157 --> 00:06:18,898
So yeah, I was quite happy with that, actually.

78
00:06:19,338 --> 00:06:20,939
Being a game about relationships,

79
00:06:21,099 --> 00:06:23,819
it was important to me to be inclusive, accessible,

80
00:06:23,879 --> 00:06:27,200
and respectful to all types of people.

81
00:06:28,021 --> 00:06:29,581
This, of course, sounds sweet and lovely,

82
00:06:30,401 --> 00:06:32,582
but it brought with it its own set of issues and challenges

83
00:06:32,662 --> 00:06:35,303
that we had to meet sensitively and thoughtfully.

84
00:06:36,283 --> 00:06:38,503
We were here to bring our players laughter and fun,

85
00:06:38,744 --> 00:06:40,484
not offend them or make them feel left out.

86
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,326
We really wanted to make a game about how people really are and how dating really is.

87
00:06:46,187 --> 00:06:53,556
Not a soft focus romance fest, but you know, the kind of gritty details about the way real

88
00:06:53,616 --> 00:06:55,318
people think and act when they're dating.

89
00:06:55,679 --> 00:07:00,504
At the heart of this are the characters and the procedural system we use to generate and

90
00:07:00,565 --> 00:07:01,085
represent them.

91
00:07:04,657 --> 00:07:09,558
So we wanted to create characters with depth and humanity, not just boring archetypes but

92
00:07:09,598 --> 00:07:15,680
real people with flaws and foibles. We wanted the player to be able to think about themselves

93
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:20,561
in the terms of the game and identify with these characters. We started with personality,

94
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:27,402
the more scientific and psychological side of things. We wanted to create a system simple

95
00:07:27,442 --> 00:07:32,363
enough to be easy to communicate but complex enough to represent everyone, at least

96
00:07:32,383 --> 00:07:33,023
approximately.

97
00:07:35,008 --> 00:07:39,631
So each character has five personality categories and each of them can be one extreme or its

98
00:07:39,671 --> 00:07:48,396
opposite. Which ones do you think you would be? In spite of not wanting to generalize, we had

99
00:07:48,416 --> 00:07:53,258
to put people into boxes in order to create game mechanics. So we were very conscious to make

100
00:07:53,318 --> 00:07:59,442
sure that no box was treated as the wrong or right box. We love all the boxes the same. We

101
00:07:59,982 --> 00:08:04,065
created ten boxes or types that characters could be. So we were very conscious to make sure that

102
00:08:05,221 --> 00:08:11,163
to be an affectionate parody of a stereotypical section of society, mostly with a British

103
00:08:11,244 --> 00:08:16,586
skew, but keeping other cultures in mind. These types are used to drive the character's

104
00:08:16,626 --> 00:08:24,248
style and interests, and also the opinions of other people's style and interests. It

105
00:08:24,268 --> 00:08:28,350
took a lot of tweaking and refining to design the system, but we felt that it does a pretty

106
00:08:28,370 --> 00:08:30,951
good job of creating characters that the player can look at.

107
00:08:32,093 --> 00:08:37,916
and take a reasonable guess at what type each character is, but also simulating the edge

108
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:41,498
cases and unusual randomness of humanity.

109
00:08:42,878 --> 00:08:43,439
Which one are you?

110
00:08:44,479 --> 00:08:44,819
Hipster?

111
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,192
So let's take a look at an example. Here's Tara, who Kitty reliably informs is a hippie type.

112
00:08:53,892 --> 00:09:00,335
Tara is bisexual and we have two candidates for her, Danny and Sky. Danny's job as a festival

113
00:09:00,395 --> 00:09:07,298
organizer should be popular with hippie Tara. Although Sky's horoscope is an air sign like

114
00:09:07,338 --> 00:09:10,739
Tara's, so if they both believe in horoscopes, that could help.

115
00:09:13,335 --> 00:09:18,017
As for what they're into, Danny is probably also a hippie based on his outfit and his

116
00:09:18,057 --> 00:09:24,020
interests. Sky is probably a glam type based on her interests, which probably won't appeal

117
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:30,763
to Tara. Maybe the fishnet stockings. However, Sky is rather partial to Tara's hair and eye

118
00:09:30,823 --> 00:09:37,746
color, so that's definitely a bonus. Personality-wise, we can see that all three of them are carefree,

119
00:09:37,826 --> 00:09:38,806
so they have that in common.

120
00:09:39,938 --> 00:09:43,899
But that's as far as it goes for Danny, whereas Sky is almost a perfect match for Tara in the

121
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:52,201
personality department. And finally, if you advance to matchmakers, we've got guilty pleasures

122
00:09:52,241 --> 00:09:56,663
and bad habits. These are the bit that I like the best because they make people the most

123
00:09:56,703 --> 00:10:01,364
human. Guilty pleasures are interests that go against the character's type because everyone

124
00:10:01,404 --> 00:10:04,625
has their peculiar foibles that they don't tell their friends about.

125
00:10:06,829 --> 00:10:14,337
Tara's guilty pleasure, smartphones, will probably go down well with Glam Sky. And Sky's

126
00:10:14,397 --> 00:10:19,722
guilty pleasure, paganism, is likely to be popular with Hippie Tara. However, Danny's not

127
00:10:19,762 --> 00:10:24,487
likely to be a match in that department because his guilty pleasure is casual video games. So

128
00:10:24,507 --> 00:10:28,851
it looks like Danny or Sky could be a match for Tara if he chose to talk about the right

129
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:29,652
things on the date.

130
00:10:30,518 --> 00:10:35,320
But remember not to ask about guilty pleasures or bad habits on a first date, because they're a bit

131
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:43,503
personal and might upset them. Which brings us to the dating part of the game. In addition to the

132
00:10:43,523 --> 00:10:49,346
characters being somewhat realistic, the dates had to feel authentic too. We were keen to evoke

133
00:10:49,406 --> 00:10:54,328
the feelings and thoughts that people have when going on a date with someone new. So we mined

134
00:10:54,388 --> 00:10:57,349
all the usual dilemmas that people have to face when they're on a date.

135
00:10:58,163 --> 00:11:04,707
What should I wear? What should I talk about? Can I tell a white lie? Can I let a fart go? Can I

136
00:11:04,747 --> 00:11:12,832
remember their name? And how forward should I be if I like them at the end of the date? Here's

137
00:11:12,852 --> 00:11:15,813
the gameplay trailer so you can see some of those dilemmas in action.

138
00:11:25,513 --> 00:11:26,034
Uh

139
00:11:26,174 --> 00:11:26,334
Boom

140
00:11:57,729 --> 00:11:59,550
Bye.

141
00:11:59,891 --> 00:12:00,491
Bye.

142
00:12:01,252 --> 00:12:01,472
Bye.

143
00:12:01,872 --> 00:12:02,693
Bye.

144
00:12:05,595 --> 00:12:06,275
Bye.

145
00:12:09,357 --> 00:12:18,564
I just spotted a bug.

146
00:12:19,124 --> 00:12:21,446
I think it's been fixed actually already.

147
00:12:23,388 --> 00:12:31,013
So, trying to do comedy in a replayable game also presented us with some unique challenges. We

148
00:12:31,033 --> 00:12:39,338
had to create a significant amount of imagery to do Kitty justice so that she could have

149
00:12:39,358 --> 00:12:44,121
enough presence in the game. We ended up doing two photo shoots and a video shoot in order to

150
00:12:44,162 --> 00:12:49,485
generate all of the assets. We bought a green screen backdrop from eBay and shot the first lot

151
00:12:49,525 --> 00:12:50,786
of images in my brother's garage.

152
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:55,236
Later we did reshoots because we decided Kitty's look needed an upgrade.

153
00:12:55,256 --> 00:12:57,437
She wasn't very happy when I told her.

154
00:12:58,278 --> 00:13:02,059
And we also needed to shoot the trailer so that the two would be consistent.

155
00:13:03,340 --> 00:13:07,441
Both of these later shoots took place in Media Molecule's kitchen because it was the only place big enough.

156
00:13:07,461 --> 00:13:10,043
Oh, that's funny.

157
00:13:13,284 --> 00:13:15,165
We also had to be careful about our age rating.

158
00:13:15,285 --> 00:13:17,666
Most drag comedy could be considered adult.

159
00:13:18,589 --> 00:13:22,652
So we sailed as close to the wind as we could for a 12 plus rating.

160
00:13:23,753 --> 00:13:26,455
Some of the restaurant names were among our saucier moments.

161
00:13:28,416 --> 00:13:30,037
I think the King's Helmet is my favorite.

162
00:13:33,460 --> 00:13:38,944
Repetition is the killer of comedy, so wherever possible we used procedural systems to create variety.

163
00:13:39,865 --> 00:13:43,868
One source of inspiration was those random name generators you see on Facebook.

164
00:13:46,018 --> 00:13:48,679
We took a similar approach with our customer and town names.

165
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:52,821
We mined the internet for lots of popular and unpopular first names.

166
00:13:53,681 --> 00:13:57,563
For the surnames and town names, we analyzed hundreds of typically British names

167
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,783
and then chopped them into first and second halves,

168
00:14:00,384 --> 00:14:02,724
which could be mixed and matched randomly.

169
00:14:03,545 --> 00:14:05,345
Just, um, doing the...

170
00:14:07,126 --> 00:14:07,346
Just...

171
00:14:08,206 --> 00:14:10,147
Sorry, I can't read the bloody text. It's too small.

172
00:14:12,546 --> 00:14:17,209
Just doing this creates some amusing combinations. Some of them we actually had to change because

173
00:14:17,229 --> 00:14:22,572
they were filthy and borderline offensive to be removed. I won't tell you what they

174
00:14:22,612 --> 00:14:29,976
were. We also wrote the entire conversation script five times to give the customers dialogue

175
00:14:29,996 --> 00:14:35,379
as much variety as possible. So each customer is randomly assigned a voice type when they're

176
00:14:35,399 --> 00:14:40,642
created, which the probability of which one they get is based on their type.

177
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:46,590
The scripts are all interchangeable so that each type can be used with every other type in

178
00:14:46,630 --> 00:14:53,016
conversation as you can see here. This is just a little exchange when one of the characters

179
00:14:53,056 --> 00:14:59,661
kills, when he decides to kill the spider and it turns out that they like spiders. The

180
00:14:59,761 --> 00:15:06,426
ickle spidery orphans left behind. So Kitty appears pretty regularly as well to make smart

181
00:15:06,547 --> 00:15:09,549
ass remarks. This helps to break up the conversation.

182
00:15:10,275 --> 00:15:16,460
and add kitty-sorty humor. Certain lines in the conversation script are tagged to pull

183
00:15:16,500 --> 00:15:22,704
specific kitty quips. Each quip has six variants, again to avoid repetitiveness, for a total

184
00:15:22,724 --> 00:15:28,729
of over 900 quips in the whole game. And that's just her appearing and making stupid comments.

185
00:15:29,689 --> 00:15:35,954
The entire game script has the same number of words as the novel Lord of the Flies. Our

186
00:15:35,994 --> 00:15:37,775
Japanese localizer wasn't very happy with us.

187
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:45,074
All of our systems, dialogue and character generation, were driven by Google Sheets and

188
00:15:45,094 --> 00:15:51,359
Google Drive. So we hooked up a special scene in Unity to download the latest spreadsheets

189
00:15:51,439 --> 00:15:55,243
when we just had to press a button and it would rewrite all the text files that drove

190
00:15:55,283 --> 00:15:59,407
the game, which was really useful because we were working remotely because we don't

191
00:15:59,427 --> 00:16:04,992
have an office. It worked wonderfully as it meant we could both, we could work collaboratively

192
00:16:05,012 --> 00:16:06,913
at the same time on the same documents.

193
00:16:10,698 --> 00:16:21,982
Another issue was that we couldn't record that much dialogue, so we were struggling to find a way to evoke Kitty's uniquely sarcastic tone, just using text and stupid noises.

194
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:28,084
Then a friend of mine posted these amusing speech mark gaffes on Facebook and I had a bit of an epiphany.

195
00:16:28,924 --> 00:16:36,206
So we went back through Kitty's entire script and judiciously added speech marks, which really helped make her the sarcastic bitch she is.

196
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:47,423
We also had one or two other unique challenges. So managing two identities is actually harder

197
00:16:47,443 --> 00:16:53,266
than it sounds. So doing interviews is easier than me, because I can kind of talk about

198
00:16:53,286 --> 00:16:59,489
serious stuff. Kitty swears a lot and likes to piss about. But obviously the crowds love

199
00:16:59,649 --> 00:17:04,552
Kitty's fabulosity. And it's not like I can just spin around like Linda Carter in the

200
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:04,772
box.

201
00:17:05,835 --> 00:17:10,697
transform magically, um, their logistics and duct tape to take into

202
00:17:10,737 --> 00:17:17,899
consideration. Um, a customer emailed us and asked us if we could add a switch to

203
00:17:17,939 --> 00:17:24,020
turn off the gaze. We chose to ignore that one. Um, we also got a little bit of

204
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:28,542
flack for how pink the game was. A vocal minority accused us of gender

205
00:17:28,562 --> 00:17:33,383
stereotyping and targeting women and girls. I thought, well they were the one

206
00:17:33,403 --> 00:17:34,743
doing the stereotyping then really.

207
00:17:35,310 --> 00:17:40,074
But we weren't doing that. The game is for everyone, and pink is Kitty's favorite color.

208
00:17:40,855 --> 00:17:41,676
So that's why we did it.

209
00:17:44,459 --> 00:17:46,500
There were also some lovely surprises, too.

210
00:17:46,681 --> 00:17:50,224
So EGX was a great opportunity to see how people took to Kitty.

211
00:17:50,985 --> 00:17:52,126
She made quite an impression.

212
00:17:52,146 --> 00:17:53,627
Everybody loved her.

213
00:17:56,450 --> 00:17:58,532
She judged the cosplay competition, which was fun.

214
00:18:00,942 --> 00:18:03,783
Also, when Game Informer published an article about me and Kitty,

215
00:18:03,963 --> 00:18:08,946
it was lovely to receive messages from other drag queens who love video games,

216
00:18:09,006 --> 00:18:13,769
telling me how great it was to see one of their drag sisters flying the flag in the games industry.

217
00:18:17,291 --> 00:18:22,354
So, in conclusion, you may not make a lot of money, you probably won't,

218
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:26,537
but being an independent developer is a unique and unparalleled opportunity

219
00:18:27,077 --> 00:18:28,518
to express yourself creatively.

220
00:18:29,572 --> 00:18:36,674
in a deeply personal and rewarding way. You can bring a kind of joy to diverse audiences that

221
00:18:36,714 --> 00:18:42,396
perhaps never expected to get that from a video game. And of course, broaden the scope of

222
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:47,978
gaming to exciting new horizons. And dress up as a bizarre freak if that's how you get your

223
00:18:48,018 --> 00:18:55,620
kicks. Um, this is, I've got time for some questions I think, maybe, have I got time for

224
00:18:55,640 --> 00:18:56,100
questions?

225
00:18:58,361 --> 00:19:05,245
Anybody? Yes? Good. If we run out of time, we can go to the breakout room. I think it's room

226
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:11,389
3000 in this building, if you want to ask me something afterwards as well. And please don't

227
00:19:11,430 --> 00:19:16,693
forget to fill out the feedback thing afterwards. So, does anyone have any questions? Go on,

228
00:19:16,713 --> 00:19:17,233
don't be shy.

229
00:19:22,958 --> 00:19:24,319
There you go.

230
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:28,142
So you made a fantastic game.

231
00:19:28,322 --> 00:19:29,483
You created your own IP.

232
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:31,305
It's this wonderfully branded product.

233
00:19:32,265 --> 00:19:33,046
Brand is all you.

234
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,867
It's absolutely fantastic.

235
00:19:34,887 --> 00:19:37,369
It went over my conservative Southern Baptist mother.

236
00:19:37,389 --> 00:19:38,010
She loves it.

237
00:19:38,070 --> 00:19:38,450
It's great.

238
00:19:41,352 --> 00:19:44,735
This is actually one of the talks that I've been most excited to come to at GDC.

239
00:19:44,755 --> 00:19:47,256
So my question is, what's next?

240
00:19:47,397 --> 00:19:48,678
Are you guys working on anything else?

241
00:19:49,378 --> 00:19:53,761
We're doing a Steam version of the game, which should be out in the summer.

242
00:19:54,522 --> 00:20:00,486
And we've actually, interestingly, done a Japanese version, which is free to play.

243
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:10,034
And actually, the character's artwork has been redone by Hatomoa, who created Hateful Boyfriend, the pigeon dating game.

244
00:20:11,054 --> 00:20:16,138
So, if that goes well, we may well bring that back over.

245
00:20:16,238 --> 00:20:18,860
So, I don't know, maybe we have two versions of the game or something.

246
00:20:20,716 --> 00:20:26,438
characters. They are cool. It's weird, it was really weird getting used to seeing the characters

247
00:20:26,458 --> 00:20:33,660
having different faces. I don't know about what we're going to work on next. I think we'll

248
00:20:33,680 --> 00:20:38,002
probably try and make something more quickly and less expensively this time, just to prove

249
00:20:38,042 --> 00:20:43,404
that we can do it. Because this was, I mean I love Kitty Powers Matchmaker, but it wasn't,

250
00:20:43,804 --> 00:20:49,326
it was very self-indulgent and I allowed myself loads of time to make it.

251
00:20:49,767 --> 00:20:52,408
But it's not really very practical from a business sense.

252
00:20:52,668 --> 00:20:56,309
So we're going to try and make something smaller, but equally

253
00:20:56,989 --> 00:20:57,449
amusing.

254
00:20:58,450 --> 00:20:59,590
What was the development time?

255
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:01,751
Took about two years to make.

256
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:02,311
Oh, OK.

257
00:21:04,352 --> 00:21:04,652
Thanks.

258
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:05,932
Anybody else?

259
00:21:07,233 --> 00:21:08,353
Go on, you know you want to.

260
00:21:10,054 --> 00:21:11,354
OK, well, we should wrap.

261
00:21:11,454 --> 00:21:12,055
Oh, there we go.

262
00:21:12,195 --> 00:21:12,735
Joe, come on.

263
00:21:14,536 --> 00:21:15,356
Make me feel popular.

264
00:21:18,252 --> 00:21:28,836
You mentioned the Japanese version. I'm interested in culturally how you think it's going to go down and what differences, apart from the artwork, you had to make or changes you had to make to the game to appeal to that market.

265
00:21:35,819 --> 00:21:40,961
The Japanese publisher, Corus, who are publishing it, they've organized the translation.

266
00:21:43,125 --> 00:21:48,731
They were the ones who said it would be better to make the characters a bit more kawaii,

267
00:21:49,071 --> 00:21:54,396
as they call it, sort of cute, an anime style, just to make it more appealing to that audience.

268
00:21:54,476 --> 00:22:01,322
But I think dating sims are popular in Japan anyway, so it seemed logical to take it over there.

269
00:22:02,283 --> 00:22:02,463
Um...

270
00:22:04,806 --> 00:22:05,326
I don't know if...

271
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:11,207
I mean, for example, there's a game, one of the dating dilemmas in the game is you have

272
00:22:11,247 --> 00:22:16,631
to tip the waiter. You have to figure out what the percentage is. But in Japan you don't

273
00:22:16,691 --> 00:22:24,216
tip. It's very rude. So, I mean, my thought on that is the game is set in England, so,

274
00:22:25,117 --> 00:22:29,440
and that's why they all have these sort of Englishisms. So I guess we can get away with

275
00:22:29,500 --> 00:22:30,240
that kind of thing.

276
00:22:33,502 --> 00:22:35,263
Because I was keen not to change it too much.

277
00:22:35,923 --> 00:22:38,625
And luckily, what I did was, when I was designing the game,

278
00:22:38,865 --> 00:22:41,526
I wanted to make the decision about free-to-play quite late.

279
00:22:42,587 --> 00:22:44,188
Because I didn't really know what the game was going to be,

280
00:22:45,029 --> 00:22:48,170
what final form it was going to take when I started it.

281
00:22:48,871 --> 00:22:51,172
We built like three versions of it before it was any good.

282
00:22:53,954 --> 00:22:55,815
So it was quite easy to do free-to-play,

283
00:22:57,776 --> 00:22:58,697
just to switch it over.

284
00:22:58,737 --> 00:23:00,238
Because the mechanics were kind of built

285
00:23:00,578 --> 00:23:02,359
to be able to do either kind of thing.

286
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:04,741
Is that right?

287
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:07,704
Anybody else?

288
00:23:07,724 --> 00:23:20,777
I was going to ask, usually when you make a game like other games, you can kind of draw from other games in the genre.

289
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:26,381
I noticed with this, it doesn't look like a lot of other dating sims, that sort of thing.

290
00:23:27,021 --> 00:23:27,702
Were there any...

291
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:34,349
What did you draw from when you go this far out in kind of a new territory?

292
00:23:36,731 --> 00:23:40,294
I really wanted to design the game around the situation rather than...

293
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:47,503
We drew...

294
00:23:47,523 --> 00:23:50,864
It's a tough one, that one, actually.

295
00:23:50,884 --> 00:23:53,905
Because we really did design the game from scratch,

296
00:23:54,005 --> 00:23:55,806
without really any reference at all.

297
00:23:56,166 --> 00:23:59,427
Because we really wanted the mechanics to support

298
00:24:00,248 --> 00:24:03,449
the feeling that we wanted to conjure up

299
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,069
in the player, kind of thing.

300
00:24:07,050 --> 00:24:10,391
But I think we actually drew from things like game shows

301
00:24:10,931 --> 00:24:14,152
and a little bit of...

302
00:24:15,348 --> 00:24:16,749
Casino-y style stuff.

303
00:24:17,910 --> 00:24:21,711
Because we wanted it to be exciting, but we didn't want to put any timers in it as well, because

304
00:24:22,292 --> 00:24:23,452
I don't, I think

305
00:24:24,352 --> 00:24:27,154
sticking a timer on gameplay is kind of annoying.

306
00:24:27,174 --> 00:24:29,315
Most people don't like it.

307
00:24:29,835 --> 00:24:33,076
And also when you're playing a game, quite a casual game like this,

308
00:24:34,337 --> 00:24:36,478
you want to be able to play it with one eye, and sort of

309
00:24:36,918 --> 00:24:40,640
while you're doing something else, almost, kind of thing, like if you're on the bus or something.

310
00:24:40,700 --> 00:24:43,401
And you want to be able to just put it down and go and make a cup of tea,

311
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:44,421
come back in.

312
00:24:45,392 --> 00:24:48,855
and not find that your game has buggered up because you've run out of time or something.

313
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:52,938
There is a pause button. But you know what I mean. We wanted to make it super accessible.

314
00:24:53,818 --> 00:24:57,341
So, yeah. I hope that answered your question properly.

315
00:24:57,901 --> 00:25:03,485
I think we've got to wrap up now, but I'm going to go down to room 3000 if you want to ask me something there.

316
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:05,486
Thank you very much for listening.
