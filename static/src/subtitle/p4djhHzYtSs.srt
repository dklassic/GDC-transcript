1
00:00:05,797 --> 00:00:08,900
So welcome to how to talk about games today.

2
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:11,303
Hopefully you're in the right place.

3
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,625
And we're going to talk a little bit about how

4
00:00:13,625 --> 00:00:14,166
to talk about games.

5
00:00:14,166 --> 00:00:14,607
All right.

6
00:00:14,607 --> 00:00:18,131
Oh yeah, I'm supposed to tell you to silence your cell phones.

7
00:00:18,131 --> 00:00:21,294
I'm supposed to tell you to please fill out

8
00:00:21,294 --> 00:00:22,295
the evaluation thingy.

9
00:00:22,295 --> 00:00:23,897
You can fill it out now.

10
00:00:24,879 --> 00:00:28,622
It's going to be a great talk, so there you go.

11
00:00:28,622 --> 00:00:29,643
So on and so forth.

12
00:00:29,643 --> 00:00:32,525
And with that, oh, and at the end,

13
00:00:32,525 --> 00:00:37,049
if you like or are interested in some of the things

14
00:00:37,049 --> 00:00:38,671
that we present and you want more information,

15
00:00:38,671 --> 00:00:40,292
we have little cards up here with a URL

16
00:00:40,292 --> 00:00:42,634
on the back of them of stuff that we've put together

17
00:00:42,634 --> 00:00:45,116
so that folks, they look like this,

18
00:00:45,116 --> 00:00:48,759
so that you can go get more stuff if you want it.

19
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,625
All right, so why does this even matter to you?

20
00:00:53,625 --> 00:00:55,907
So a lot of the things that are happening right now

21
00:00:55,907 --> 00:00:58,130
around games and the way that we talk about games

22
00:00:58,130 --> 00:01:02,134
in the public sphere and the way that folks are concerned

23
00:01:02,134 --> 00:01:05,998
or interested in their effects and the way

24
00:01:05,998 --> 00:01:07,680
that they're consumed in society.

25
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:10,642
That can result in a number of different things.

26
00:01:10,642 --> 00:01:12,924
So one of the things that can happen there

27
00:01:12,924 --> 00:01:17,707
is that the legislative and political bodies take

28
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:18,807
a look at something and they decide

29
00:01:18,807 --> 00:01:22,049
that they're going to make new rules around to fix

30
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:25,171
what they perceive to be as a problem in that space.

31
00:01:26,752 --> 00:01:32,976
It also forms part of the cultural basis of why and how the general public thinks about games.

32
00:01:32,976 --> 00:01:37,098
So when you go home and you talk to your mom about video games, what do they think about video games?

33
00:01:37,098 --> 00:01:39,360
What do their friends think about video games?

34
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,661
How do we as a society think about games in general?

35
00:01:43,222 --> 00:01:44,764
And what does that mean?

36
00:01:44,764 --> 00:01:50,633
And when certain issues hit the mass media, when they hit the newspaper, when they hit

37
00:01:50,633 --> 00:01:56,962
the talk shows, when they hit the news cycles, etc., that can start to sway public opinion

38
00:01:56,962 --> 00:01:58,323
this way, that way, what have you.

39
00:01:59,404 --> 00:02:06,148
And then last but not least, all of that discussion influences, you know, we're raising kids,

40
00:02:06,148 --> 00:02:11,150
they're getting mixed messages from the media in and of themselves, so how do they think

41
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:15,253
about games and how does that sort of inform the next generation around what they think

42
00:02:15,253 --> 00:02:15,693
about games?

43
00:02:15,693 --> 00:02:19,815
So we were all talking about this sort of behind the scenes with each other, because

44
00:02:19,815 --> 00:02:22,996
we're usually friends.

45
00:02:22,996 --> 00:02:23,697
Usually.

46
00:02:23,697 --> 00:02:24,177
Yeah, I know, right?

47
00:02:24,758 --> 00:02:26,659
And we were having a discussion about it.

48
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:29,782
We said, hey, maybe we should throw together a panel on this

49
00:02:29,782 --> 00:02:31,743
because it's fairly timely right now.

50
00:02:31,743 --> 00:02:32,224
So we did.

51
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:36,207
These are my esteemed colleagues and panelists.

52
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:38,728
They all have a great number of fancy titles

53
00:02:38,728 --> 00:02:39,769
next to their names.

54
00:02:39,769 --> 00:02:42,051
They will probably introduce themselves

55
00:02:42,051 --> 00:02:44,072
as they get up and talk so that they'll

56
00:02:44,072 --> 00:02:46,875
cover what their fancy titles actually mean.

57
00:02:46,875 --> 00:02:49,036
But in the background of all of those fancy titles,

58
00:02:51,914 --> 00:02:58,418
There's a lot of organizational leadership in the folks that are sitting up here right now.

59
00:02:58,418 --> 00:03:03,040
We've got a Canada research chair that used to be president of DIGRA.

60
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,264
We've got leadership in Global Game Jam.

61
00:03:06,264 --> 00:03:10,445
We've got leadership in Higher Education Video Game Alliance.

62
00:03:10,445 --> 00:03:11,445
So on and so forth.

63
00:03:11,445 --> 00:03:15,726
And so just a wealth of experience in different ways

64
00:03:15,726 --> 00:03:18,587
that these issues have impacted some of the organizations

65
00:03:18,587 --> 00:03:21,148
in and around games with that.

66
00:03:21,148 --> 00:03:24,609
So what am I actually talking about when I say these issues,

67
00:03:24,609 --> 00:03:25,289
stuff like that?

68
00:03:25,289 --> 00:03:28,350
And I'm sure that you can all name them.

69
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:30,811
But just to sort of put a point on it,

70
00:03:30,811 --> 00:03:33,272
so the games and violence debate.

71
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:36,231
The games and addiction debate, right?

72
00:03:36,231 --> 00:03:39,352
Games are addictive now, and we're gonna classify that

73
00:03:39,352 --> 00:03:40,933
in the health organization.

74
00:03:40,933 --> 00:03:43,494
Games and health more generally, right?

75
00:03:43,494 --> 00:03:47,256
Games and their effect on society, so on and so forth.

76
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:50,678
One of my personal favorites was the one where

77
00:03:50,678 --> 00:03:52,739
we don't, you know, the problem with unemployment

78
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:54,279
is because we make video games,

79
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:58,021
and so young men don't want jobs anymore.

80
00:03:58,021 --> 00:03:59,782
I found it particularly interesting.

81
00:03:59,782 --> 00:04:00,822
All right.

82
00:04:00,822 --> 00:04:01,503
All right.

83
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:19,392
So why are we here? So this session is about understanding the background of some of these recent discussions and then a call to action for developers to start to have a voice in and around some of these debates directly as somebody that knows something about making video games rather than not being a part of that engagement.

84
00:04:19,392 --> 00:04:20,273
So with that...

85
00:04:33,852 --> 00:04:39,393
Okay. Good afternoon. My name is Lindsay Grace and I'm going to be talking about moral panic

86
00:04:39,393 --> 00:04:45,734
and misunderstanding. So last year I wrote a couple of articles for CNN and some other

87
00:04:45,734 --> 00:04:51,455
venues, Associated Press, and also sat on a panel around discussing the new World Health

88
00:04:51,455 --> 00:04:56,696
Organization's classification of games addiction and this debate around games and violence

89
00:04:56,696 --> 00:05:00,616
and whether or not shooters are somehow inspired by games.

90
00:05:01,522 --> 00:05:06,026
So what I'm here to do is to actually help you understand that we've actually been here before.

91
00:05:06,026 --> 00:05:09,029
So the first place we'll start is comic books.

92
00:05:09,029 --> 00:05:13,312
So in the last century, comic books were considered the source of much debate.

93
00:05:13,312 --> 00:05:19,097
My favorite quote of the era is from Frederick Wortham, who wrote the book Seduction of the Innocent.

94
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:25,082
And Frederick explicitly claimed to Senate that he thinks Hitler was a beginner compared

95
00:05:25,082 --> 00:05:26,823
to the comic book industry.

96
00:05:26,823 --> 00:05:28,385
And this is in the context of 1940s U.S.

97
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:35,557
So basically, it was widely debated as to whether or not comic books were the source

98
00:05:35,557 --> 00:05:37,438
of juvenile delinquency.

99
00:05:37,438 --> 00:05:42,781
Book burnings commenced, and this is one of them, and generally comic books were considered

100
00:05:42,781 --> 00:05:48,844
dangerous, the same comic books that have inspired lots of contemporary media.

101
00:05:48,844 --> 00:05:53,527
At some point, what you'll see in the history is that all leisure seems subject to moral

102
00:05:53,527 --> 00:05:53,927
panic.

103
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,270
So we'll go back to the Puritans to start.

104
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:00,291
This is a great little article from Sports Illustrated

105
00:06:00,291 --> 00:06:03,111
and Robert Doyle basically describes

106
00:06:03,111 --> 00:06:05,672
and highlights the Puritans supporting

107
00:06:05,672 --> 00:06:08,392
of the burning of the Book of Sports.

108
00:06:08,392 --> 00:06:10,312
If you're unfamiliar with the Book of Sports,

109
00:06:10,312 --> 00:06:13,353
it was basically a 1600s era guide

110
00:06:13,353 --> 00:06:17,474
to Sunday sport and recreation for after church.

111
00:06:17,474 --> 00:06:21,634
It was publicly burned in England in 1643

112
00:06:21,634 --> 00:06:24,215
because it was dangerous and evil.

113
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:30,641
Later, if you go through the histories of the Industrial Revolution, for example, you

114
00:06:30,641 --> 00:06:35,062
could read Cunningham's Leisure in the Industrial Revolution, you'll learn about the fact that

115
00:06:35,062 --> 00:06:40,984
class, religion, and ideology, ideological tensions, existed around things as trivial

116
00:06:40,984 --> 00:06:43,925
as tourism.

117
00:06:43,925 --> 00:06:49,926
So for example, there are discussions about how travel, music, and racing, the new leisures

118
00:06:49,926 --> 00:06:53,647
available to a middle class, were actually part of an anti-social culture.

119
00:06:54,805 --> 00:06:58,446
And then there's Dungeons and Dragons.

120
00:06:58,446 --> 00:07:02,328
So if you don't know about the Dungeons and Dragons story,

121
00:07:02,328 --> 00:07:04,008
I've got to tell you.

122
00:07:04,008 --> 00:07:05,789
So the great, I like the way they described it,

123
00:07:05,789 --> 00:07:09,150
there was the great 1980s Dungeons and Dragons panics.

124
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,910
There's a great little BBC magazine article

125
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,130
you can read about it.

126
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:15,892
And explicitly, D&D, Dungeons and Dragons,

127
00:07:15,892 --> 00:07:18,852
was accused of inspiring suicides, occult activity,

128
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:22,093
being aligned with rape, prostitution, sadism,

129
00:07:22,093 --> 00:07:24,294
sex perversion, all kinds of things.

130
00:07:25,221 --> 00:07:30,863
In fact, it was actually linked to a murder by a man, the man who committed the murder was Darren Molitor in 1985.

131
00:07:30,863 --> 00:07:35,705
And Darren wrote a letter that helped feed this moral panic.

132
00:07:35,705 --> 00:07:44,168
In the letter, and I've just highlighted a few things here, he explicitly talks about how Dungeons and Dragons inspired him to be violent,

133
00:07:44,168 --> 00:07:48,250
and he described it as possessive, addictive, and evil.

134
00:07:50,212 --> 00:07:53,693
So D&D was once addictive and inspired violence.

135
00:07:53,693 --> 00:07:55,574
You'll start to see a trend here.

136
00:07:55,574 --> 00:08:00,316
So the founding of an organization called

137
00:08:00,316 --> 00:08:02,937
Bothered About Dungeons and Dragons,

138
00:08:02,937 --> 00:08:06,918
inspired by MAD, Mothers Against Drunk Driving,

139
00:08:06,918 --> 00:08:09,079
was founded by a woman named Pat Pulling.

140
00:08:09,079 --> 00:08:12,020
And in 83, BAD went out and set forth

141
00:08:12,020 --> 00:08:15,921
to help people get away from the addictive properties of D&D.

142
00:08:16,922 --> 00:08:18,883
One of the things that this person did,

143
00:08:18,883 --> 00:08:20,804
Pat Pulling actually created a book called The Devil's Web,

144
00:08:20,804 --> 00:08:23,685
where she talks about the intersection

145
00:08:23,685 --> 00:08:26,306
of Satan and entertainment.

146
00:08:26,306 --> 00:08:27,706
And she became the director

147
00:08:27,706 --> 00:08:30,267
of the National Coalition on TV Violence.

148
00:08:30,267 --> 00:08:32,748
The National Coalition on TV Violence

149
00:08:32,748 --> 00:08:35,469
actually earned the support of the US Surgeon General,

150
00:08:35,469 --> 00:08:37,250
at the time it was C. Everett Koop,

151
00:08:37,250 --> 00:08:41,452
who did believe that TV was part of the problem for violence

152
00:08:41,452 --> 00:08:43,993
which brings us to television.

153
00:08:43,993 --> 00:08:45,793
So if you think about television,

154
00:08:46,662 --> 00:08:50,884
In the history of analyzing TV and its effects on aggression,

155
00:08:50,884 --> 00:08:53,526
we actually have more than 40 years of data and analysis.

156
00:08:53,526 --> 00:08:57,208
One of the claims that was proven in a study,

157
00:08:57,208 --> 00:09:00,669
like this study, is actually that third graders become

158
00:09:00,669 --> 00:09:04,391
more violent from watching TV even 10 years later.

159
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:05,712
This is a study published in 72.

160
00:09:05,712 --> 00:09:10,254
And we also, that there is a clear, rather,

161
00:09:10,254 --> 00:09:12,655
positive correlation between TV violence

162
00:09:12,655 --> 00:09:13,836
and aggressive behavior.

163
00:09:13,836 --> 00:09:16,197
This is from another study published in 94.

164
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,007
So of course, you must be asking,

165
00:09:19,007 --> 00:09:21,309
science proves that television fosters aggression.

166
00:09:21,309 --> 00:09:26,432
Except, after 40 years, some people are still saying no.

167
00:09:26,432 --> 00:09:29,253
So in this example, which is a study from 2008,

168
00:09:29,253 --> 00:09:33,896
it does not, their understanding of the relationship

169
00:09:33,896 --> 00:09:37,238
indicates that they do not correlate properly.

170
00:09:37,238 --> 00:09:39,519
So, there are lots of publications

171
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:43,001
and lots of peer-reviewed, high-quality research

172
00:09:43,001 --> 00:09:45,983
that actually says there's no link between violent and TV.

173
00:09:47,444 --> 00:09:50,505
Then there's the next one, television addiction.

174
00:09:50,505 --> 00:09:53,027
So one of the best, I think,

175
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:55,368
quotes from this Scientific American publication

176
00:09:55,368 --> 00:09:58,709
that the famous Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Kubi

177
00:09:58,709 --> 00:09:59,530
actually wrote together,

178
00:09:59,530 --> 00:10:02,631
is that most of the criteria for substance abuse

179
00:10:02,631 --> 00:10:04,392
or substance dependence can apply to people

180
00:10:04,392 --> 00:10:05,412
who watch a lot of TV.

181
00:10:05,412 --> 00:10:08,774
What do you think about how pervasive television is

182
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,035
in many modern cultures?

183
00:10:11,675 --> 00:10:13,856
And I actually did some quick research.

184
00:10:13,856 --> 00:10:15,537
So there's an OECD publication that

185
00:10:15,537 --> 00:10:17,858
talks about how people use their leisure time.

186
00:10:17,858 --> 00:10:21,419
And at this point, across the 19 countries that were surveyed,

187
00:10:21,419 --> 00:10:23,480
it's about 39% of our leisure.

188
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:27,062
So when you're not working, you're almost a 50% chance

189
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:29,083
that you're watching TV.

190
00:10:29,083 --> 00:10:31,304
And we have some results, some research

191
00:10:31,304 --> 00:10:31,884
that claims that.

192
00:10:32,384 --> 00:10:35,607
If you look at meta-analysis, or you look at the different previous studies,

193
00:10:35,607 --> 00:10:40,692
you'll find that there's actually a smaller effect of violent video games

194
00:10:40,692 --> 00:10:42,974
than television violence,

195
00:10:42,974 --> 00:10:44,675
which I think is an interesting observation,

196
00:10:44,675 --> 00:10:49,840
given how much society is not worried about TV.

197
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,743
So, that brings us to games.

198
00:10:52,743 --> 00:10:53,743
If we talk about games...

199
00:10:54,852 --> 00:10:57,974
I think one approach, theme of the presentations

200
00:10:57,974 --> 00:11:00,215
that we're all giving, one way to talk about games

201
00:11:00,215 --> 00:11:04,337
is actually to remind people of our worldwide political past

202
00:11:04,337 --> 00:11:05,677
with leisure.

203
00:11:05,677 --> 00:11:07,238
So I gave you these references, right?

204
00:11:07,238 --> 00:11:09,579
Point them to the moral panics that have occurred before

205
00:11:09,579 --> 00:11:11,700
when people were worried that if we allowed people

206
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:14,721
to go and be tourists, they would lose their connection

207
00:11:14,721 --> 00:11:17,443
to religion, or that we were burning books

208
00:11:17,443 --> 00:11:19,624
because we thought that they were dangerous,

209
00:11:19,624 --> 00:11:22,005
or that we really did believe in Dungeons and Dragons

210
00:11:22,005 --> 00:11:24,386
being a very dangerous and addicting experience.

211
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:28,198
And then also point them to the people who misled us

212
00:11:28,198 --> 00:11:31,179
to the detriment of the people they were looking to help.

213
00:11:31,179 --> 00:11:33,339
We wanted happy, healthy children,

214
00:11:33,339 --> 00:11:36,860
and some people had some approaches that seemed questionable.

215
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:40,581
So, remind people and really highlight this idea

216
00:11:40,581 --> 00:11:43,002
that there is a dangerous game of pitting leisure

217
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:50,243
against morality, and that leisure itself is political.

218
00:11:50,243 --> 00:11:53,144
Attacking leisure is an opportunity to chip at culture.

219
00:11:55,177 --> 00:11:57,678
and enforce your own culture.

220
00:11:57,678 --> 00:11:59,960
It's a little bit of a culture war.

221
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:02,701
So, as scientists, politicians, and journalists

222
00:12:02,701 --> 00:12:04,342
claim the detriments of comic books,

223
00:12:04,342 --> 00:12:06,543
that they would drive innocent children

224
00:12:06,543 --> 00:12:10,124
into the clutches of juvenile delinquency,

225
00:12:10,124 --> 00:12:12,125
others actually highlighted the fact

226
00:12:12,125 --> 00:12:13,986
that comic books attracted a high quotient

227
00:12:13,986 --> 00:12:15,747
of creative people who thought of,

228
00:12:15,747 --> 00:12:19,429
basically got access to a more,

229
00:12:19,429 --> 00:12:21,550
but a new publishing venue.

230
00:12:21,550 --> 00:12:23,191
So it really offered them opportunities

231
00:12:23,191 --> 00:12:24,471
that other modes of publishing didn't.

232
00:12:25,730 --> 00:12:31,172
So attacking games kind of mirrors the past attacks on leisure that we've seen historically.

233
00:12:31,172 --> 00:12:35,313
And in an era of declining leisure,

234
00:12:35,313 --> 00:12:41,034
where in the US workism is becoming the new religion,

235
00:12:41,034 --> 00:12:44,635
and work may even be killing us,

236
00:12:44,635 --> 00:12:47,896
maybe we should not attack leisure.

237
00:12:47,896 --> 00:12:51,237
We should ask about the root of these discords, of this discord.

238
00:12:52,862 --> 00:12:57,105
So like TV, no matter what, it's going to be a long time.

239
00:12:57,105 --> 00:12:58,505
If we can ever make these links, it's

240
00:12:58,505 --> 00:12:59,726
going to take us a long time to do it.

241
00:12:59,726 --> 00:13:02,748
But I remind you, as people at GDC,

242
00:13:02,748 --> 00:13:06,590
that games don't need to be burned to be erased.

243
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,331
Erasing our cultural contribution is much easier.

244
00:13:09,331 --> 00:13:13,173
And if you'd like, we're going to give you

245
00:13:13,173 --> 00:13:15,054
a bunch of links to some things that

246
00:13:15,054 --> 00:13:18,056
help you understand how all this works together.

247
00:13:18,056 --> 00:13:19,257
Thanks.

248
00:13:19,257 --> 00:13:19,877
That's all I have.

249
00:13:38,195 --> 00:13:38,516
Yep, there we go.

250
00:13:38,516 --> 00:13:39,778
Thanks, I drew the short straw

251
00:13:39,778 --> 00:13:42,664
and got to talk about games and violence.

252
00:13:42,664 --> 00:13:45,710
I'm Mia Consolvo, I'm the Canada Research Chair

253
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:48,877
in Game Studies and Design.

254
00:13:49,898 --> 00:13:52,959
Yeah, there's, I'm just basically doing a deep dive

255
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,240
into what Lindsay was alluding to in terms of the research,

256
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,280
mostly the social science research on games

257
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,760
and their links to violence and aggression,

258
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:02,041
that kind of thing.

259
00:14:02,041 --> 00:14:05,181
And I would point out also that this is one of the most

260
00:14:05,181 --> 00:14:08,042
like heavily scrutinized areas of research

261
00:14:08,042 --> 00:14:09,662
that you will come across.

262
00:14:09,662 --> 00:14:12,583
You know, if I did a study in this particular field,

263
00:14:12,583 --> 00:14:14,083
I would be scared to death to publish it

264
00:14:14,083 --> 00:14:15,943
because you're just immediately jumped on

265
00:14:15,943 --> 00:14:17,583
and everything is just.

266
00:14:17,743 --> 00:14:20,285
As it should be, it should be carefully reviewed,

267
00:14:20,285 --> 00:14:24,447
but there is a ton of people looking at this research

268
00:14:24,447 --> 00:14:28,028
and seeing if it is up to scratch.

269
00:14:28,028 --> 00:14:30,990
It is not just research about games and violence, though,

270
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:33,831
that's been problematic or called into account.

271
00:14:33,831 --> 00:14:36,252
If you pay attention to the news,

272
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:38,793
you may notice social science research in general

273
00:14:38,793 --> 00:14:40,254
has been having a rough time.

274
00:14:40,494 --> 00:14:44,958
You may hear the word replication crisis being used.

275
00:14:44,958 --> 00:14:46,099
Basically what happened is,

276
00:14:46,099 --> 00:14:48,581
especially a lot of research in psychology,

277
00:14:48,581 --> 00:14:50,383
you remember, like at university,

278
00:14:50,383 --> 00:14:51,284
and like those sophomores,

279
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:52,465
they get called to do, you know,

280
00:14:52,465 --> 00:14:54,086
for extra credit, you do the research.

281
00:14:54,086 --> 00:14:56,128
And some of those early studies

282
00:14:56,128 --> 00:14:59,451
that had like very influential findings,

283
00:14:59,451 --> 00:15:00,832
people are finally getting around

284
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,033
to replicating some of them,

285
00:15:02,033 --> 00:15:05,336
and some of them are not holding up to scrutiny.

286
00:15:05,336 --> 00:15:07,818
One of the biggest examples is the marshmallow test.

287
00:15:08,255 --> 00:15:12,737
So if you remember, this is the one where you put a kid in a room with a plate of marshmallows and you're like

288
00:15:13,641 --> 00:15:14,802
I don't know exactly how you do it,

289
00:15:14,802 --> 00:15:17,683
but see how long they can wait,

290
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:19,705
and if they can avoid eating the marshmallow,

291
00:15:19,705 --> 00:15:21,586
and it's all about grit, right?

292
00:15:21,586 --> 00:15:23,767
And if you can avoid eating the marshmallow,

293
00:15:23,767 --> 00:15:24,928
then 10 years down the line,

294
00:15:24,928 --> 00:15:26,749
you're gonna get into Stanford, right?

295
00:15:26,749 --> 00:15:29,250
And your life is gonna be cake and wonderful.

296
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,592
And what the replication found was that,

297
00:15:32,592 --> 00:15:35,014
well, no, actually, it's more about your background

298
00:15:35,014 --> 00:15:36,395
and your socioeconomic class

299
00:15:36,395 --> 00:15:39,096
that leads you to be able to resist the marshmallow

300
00:15:39,096 --> 00:15:42,058
rather than some inner grit.

301
00:15:42,058 --> 00:15:42,338
So, yeah.

302
00:15:43,485 --> 00:15:47,648
A lot of social science research you really just need to take with a grain of salt and

303
00:15:47,648 --> 00:15:48,809
see is it standing up?

304
00:15:48,809 --> 00:15:52,652
And also, as Lindsay was saying, this is culture.

305
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:57,676
People are changing and our culture is changing and so we can't just say if we found something

306
00:15:57,676 --> 00:16:00,038
once in the past it's necessarily going to hold up.

307
00:16:01,650 --> 00:16:04,073
To games and violence, however, if you

308
00:16:04,073 --> 00:16:07,677
are looking for an actual book to read on this topic

309
00:16:07,677 --> 00:16:11,802
and you're not allergic to academic prose,

310
00:16:11,802 --> 00:16:13,824
I would highly recommend Barry Gunter's 2016

311
00:16:13,824 --> 00:16:17,128
Does Playing Video Games Make Players More Violent?

312
00:16:17,969 --> 00:16:20,331
I have the title in the handout on the website.

313
00:16:20,331 --> 00:16:20,751
It's 280 pages.

314
00:16:20,751 --> 00:16:22,313
I read all of them.

315
00:16:22,313 --> 00:16:27,817
The panelists know because I've told them this repeatedly.

316
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:31,340
I think reading the book at times made me violent

317
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:34,263
more than a video game has probably made anyone violent.

318
00:16:34,263 --> 00:16:36,885
But it's a very thorough accounting

319
00:16:36,885 --> 00:16:40,508
of hundreds of the studies over the past

320
00:16:40,508 --> 00:16:41,869
looking at games and violence.

321
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:49,424
So this is a big block of text, but what he's basically saying here is just that video game

322
00:16:49,424 --> 00:16:54,588
playing doesn't occur in a social vacuum, right? Like, it's a part of our culture and our daily

323
00:16:54,588 --> 00:16:59,851
life. We have, you know, a socioeconomic background, we live in certain places,

324
00:16:59,851 --> 00:17:04,574
we have different educations, we have different genders. All of these things play a role.

325
00:17:04,995 --> 00:17:07,316
And as he says, going one step further to differentiate

326
00:17:07,316 --> 00:17:09,077
between the effects of violent video games

327
00:17:09,077 --> 00:17:10,618
as distinct from those of violent movies,

328
00:17:10,618 --> 00:17:12,940
you know, and watching in a movie theater

329
00:17:12,940 --> 00:17:15,961
or program scene on TV is even more challenging.

330
00:17:15,961 --> 00:17:18,263
It's so incredibly hard with people to like,

331
00:17:18,263 --> 00:17:21,005
pull out one particular thread of what they do,

332
00:17:21,005 --> 00:17:23,286
you know, to say how does this, you know,

333
00:17:23,286 --> 00:17:25,167
affect the whole rest of their life?

334
00:17:25,167 --> 00:17:27,028
How can we hold every other element

335
00:17:27,028 --> 00:17:29,870
of people's lives constant, you know, to see?

336
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:32,412
You know, so that's like a really key thing to think about.

337
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,712
And again, placing this in context, Lindsay did this,

338
00:17:36,712 --> 00:17:38,513
so I'll just go through it quickly,

339
00:17:38,513 --> 00:17:40,375
but there have been studies, you know,

340
00:17:40,375 --> 00:17:41,996
and it does relate to moral panics,

341
00:17:41,996 --> 00:17:43,797
but people worried about movies,

342
00:17:43,797 --> 00:17:45,358
people worried about television,

343
00:17:45,358 --> 00:17:48,020
the cultivation model in the 80s basically said

344
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:49,521
if you watch a lot of violent TV,

345
00:17:49,521 --> 00:17:52,404
maybe you wouldn't become aggressive,

346
00:17:52,404 --> 00:17:55,046
but you would think the world is a mean and scary place,

347
00:17:55,046 --> 00:17:56,607
much more than it actually was.

348
00:17:57,367 --> 00:18:00,950
And a lot of the early research, even on violent games,

349
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,852
tended to link violent media together

350
00:18:02,852 --> 00:18:05,294
in terms of when you studied populations.

351
00:18:05,294 --> 00:18:07,736
And so you can't even pick out, like, how this, you know,

352
00:18:07,736 --> 00:18:08,757
did games do something?

353
00:18:08,757 --> 00:18:10,638
Because it was just, this is like people

354
00:18:10,638 --> 00:18:13,000
who watch violent TV and movies and that kind of thing.

355
00:18:14,362 --> 00:18:16,603
When you get to the research on games themselves,

356
00:18:16,603 --> 00:18:18,864
there are three types of studies that you see.

357
00:18:18,864 --> 00:18:24,107
So there are surveys where you're having children or adults

358
00:18:24,107 --> 00:18:27,609
fill out detailed questionnaires about their media use,

359
00:18:27,609 --> 00:18:29,110
their backgrounds, their personality type,

360
00:18:29,110 --> 00:18:30,551
that kind of thing.

361
00:18:30,551 --> 00:18:32,872
You have naturalistic observation where perhaps

362
00:18:32,872 --> 00:18:35,113
you go to playgrounds and watch people play

363
00:18:35,113 --> 00:18:37,775
and then try and infer that and maybe talk with them later

364
00:18:37,775 --> 00:18:39,416
about their media diet.

365
00:18:39,556 --> 00:18:41,257
to see if there are any correlations.

366
00:18:41,257 --> 00:18:44,958
And then you have experiments where you set people up

367
00:18:44,958 --> 00:18:47,679
in a lab and you have them play a game

368
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,281
and then take a survey or interact in some way.

369
00:18:52,281 --> 00:18:55,723
So there are problems associated with

370
00:18:55,723 --> 00:18:58,604
all of these types of methods.

371
00:18:58,604 --> 00:19:03,186
So for surveys, you can't actually prove causality, right?

372
00:19:03,186 --> 00:19:07,247
The most that you can do is actually find a correlation.

373
00:19:07,247 --> 00:19:08,428
You know, people who.

374
00:19:09,652 --> 00:19:14,337
play a lot of Grand Theft Auto,

375
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:17,641
are also maybe arguing a lot with their teachers,

376
00:19:17,641 --> 00:19:18,381
but you don't know.

377
00:19:18,381 --> 00:19:20,864
Maybe they argue a lot with their teachers

378
00:19:20,864 --> 00:19:22,366
and then they go play Grand Theft Auto, right?

379
00:19:22,366 --> 00:19:25,129
Like there's no one way that you can see

380
00:19:25,129 --> 00:19:26,010
that the evidence is pointing

381
00:19:26,010 --> 00:19:27,752
that one necessarily leads to the other.

382
00:19:30,407 --> 00:19:33,228
If you're observing people in a setting,

383
00:19:33,228 --> 00:19:36,750
you have little control over the actual setting.

384
00:19:36,750 --> 00:19:39,451
It's not a population sample.

385
00:19:39,451 --> 00:19:41,773
This is just a very convenient sample,

386
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:43,433
and you can't control the variables.

387
00:19:44,261 --> 00:19:47,143
And with experiments, it's an artificial setting,

388
00:19:47,143 --> 00:19:49,045
so you're having people come into a lab

389
00:19:49,045 --> 00:19:50,586
and play a video game,

390
00:19:50,586 --> 00:19:53,889
and I mean, it's just completely unnatural.

391
00:19:53,889 --> 00:19:55,891
But also in terms of effect time,

392
00:19:55,891 --> 00:19:57,792
because maybe they're having them fill out a survey

393
00:19:57,792 --> 00:19:58,813
or react to something,

394
00:19:58,813 --> 00:20:00,915
so you might be able to say,

395
00:20:00,915 --> 00:20:04,078
oh, they got a little angry 15 minutes after my test,

396
00:20:04,078 --> 00:20:06,159
but you don't know necessarily did that,

397
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,542
maybe then they got over it a day, a week, a month later.

398
00:20:09,542 --> 00:20:11,063
So it's really hard with experiments

399
00:20:11,063 --> 00:20:12,605
to show anything beyond.

400
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:14,846
immediate effect.

401
00:20:14,846 --> 00:20:16,306
Other

402
00:20:16,306 --> 00:20:20,148
critiques that people have made of some of the research on violence in games.

403
00:20:20,148 --> 00:20:24,229
Studies can examine these, these seem kind of similar,

404
00:20:24,229 --> 00:20:31,071
but they're actually very different things that people are looking at. Violent thoughts, violent feelings, and violent behaviors, right?

405
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:35,573
They're not all the same thing. If you have a thought about what

406
00:20:35,653 --> 00:20:38,515
you might do to somebody who cuts you off in traffic,

407
00:20:38,515 --> 00:20:40,276
that doesn't mean that you necessarily go

408
00:20:40,276 --> 00:20:41,717
and do the thing, right?

409
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,218
The thought and the behavior,

410
00:20:43,218 --> 00:20:46,741
even though you'd really like to, are not equivalent.

411
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:50,163
The feeling, you may have rage directed

412
00:20:50,163 --> 00:20:52,445
at the person who cut you off in traffic,

413
00:20:52,445 --> 00:20:55,367
that does not necessarily mean you're gonna do the thing.

414
00:20:55,367 --> 00:20:56,948
So you have to look at what the studies

415
00:20:56,948 --> 00:20:58,409
are actually studying.

416
00:21:00,482 --> 00:21:03,324
Studies use different measures and definitions

417
00:21:03,324 --> 00:21:05,245
of what aggression actually is.

418
00:21:05,245 --> 00:21:07,366
Some have tried to standardize over time

419
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:10,388
and they have standardized personality tests

420
00:21:10,388 --> 00:21:11,888
or definitions like they carry over

421
00:21:11,888 --> 00:21:12,909
from one study to another,

422
00:21:12,909 --> 00:21:14,910
but especially a lot of the early research

423
00:21:15,737 --> 00:21:19,141
varied wildly in terms of what they said about them.

424
00:21:19,141 --> 00:21:21,884
And there are ethical concerns about using and testing

425
00:21:21,884 --> 00:21:23,386
actual aggression, right?

426
00:21:23,386 --> 00:21:26,229
You can't just say, I'm gonna have kids play this game

427
00:21:26,229 --> 00:21:27,731
and then I'm gonna have another kid go up

428
00:21:27,731 --> 00:21:30,694
and punch the kid to see if he punches him back, right?

429
00:21:30,694 --> 00:21:33,497
Like, ethics review boards really don't like you

430
00:21:33,497 --> 00:21:34,418
to do that kind of thing.

431
00:21:35,599 --> 00:21:41,705
And so you have to develop substitutes for what an aggressive act might be.

432
00:21:41,705 --> 00:21:44,288
So a really common one is the noise blast.

433
00:21:44,288 --> 00:21:48,972
You're playing with somebody else and you want to punish them and it's like, how loud

434
00:21:48,972 --> 00:21:50,614
a blast of noise do you give them?

435
00:21:50,614 --> 00:21:52,896
And that's like a substitute.

436
00:21:52,896 --> 00:21:56,520
Is a loud noise blast really the same thing as punching someone?

437
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,002
Another substitute is hot sauce.

438
00:22:00,002 --> 00:22:02,023
You know, you want to punish somebody.

439
00:22:02,023 --> 00:22:07,065
How much hot sauce are you putting on, like, food that they're being given?

440
00:22:07,065 --> 00:22:09,366
Culturally, this is really weird to me.

441
00:22:09,366 --> 00:22:11,547
You know, I'd be like, more hot sauce, please.

442
00:22:11,547 --> 00:22:13,728
Like, you just don't like me. You didn't put much on there.

443
00:22:16,184 --> 00:22:18,606
If you go through again all of this literature,

444
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,549
there are two major theories or approaches

445
00:22:21,549 --> 00:22:24,692
in terms of trying to figure out these links.

446
00:22:24,692 --> 00:22:26,935
There's the general aggression model, the GAM,

447
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:29,678
which Craig Anderson is one of the leading researchers on.

448
00:22:29,958 --> 00:22:32,338
which is mostly focusing on thoughts,

449
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:33,959
is installing scripts for behavior

450
00:22:33,959 --> 00:22:37,139
that you play these games, and you're learning reactions,

451
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,640
like, and that's gonna influence then what you actually do.

452
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,780
And then in CounterPoint, the catalyst model,

453
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:45,361
which is Chris Ferguson, Chris Ferguson has been like

454
00:22:45,361 --> 00:22:49,422
one of the most active opponents of the GAM

455
00:22:49,422 --> 00:22:51,522
and their research and calling out their methods.

456
00:22:51,522 --> 00:22:55,783
And he says that, you know, their findings are just suspect.

457
00:22:55,783 --> 00:22:57,963
And he looks at things like personality

458
00:22:57,963 --> 00:22:59,203
and environmental factors.

459
00:23:00,879 --> 00:23:02,860
Everyone does agree it's not a simple issue.

460
00:23:02,860 --> 00:23:04,201
Gosh, thanks, it's complicated.

461
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:07,362
But they'll say things like,

462
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:08,883
it depends on a player's neighborhood,

463
00:23:08,883 --> 00:23:10,524
their family history, their school performance,

464
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,365
their friends, personality, social history,

465
00:23:12,365 --> 00:23:14,046
immediate diet, gender, mental health,

466
00:23:14,046 --> 00:23:15,746
and so on and so on and so on.

467
00:23:15,746 --> 00:23:18,228
And so what they all do at least agree on

468
00:23:18,228 --> 00:23:21,749
is that what you're looking for are risk factors associated.

469
00:23:21,749 --> 00:23:25,111
But again, figuring out, and they argue about

470
00:23:25,111 --> 00:23:26,932
what those risk factors might be

471
00:23:26,932 --> 00:23:28,153
and the best ways to do them.

472
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,861
You'll also hear people talk about the meta-analyses,

473
00:23:31,861 --> 00:23:34,542
you know, the big studies that take all the studies

474
00:23:34,542 --> 00:23:37,424
and say, well, maybe if we cram them all together,

475
00:23:37,424 --> 00:23:40,926
we'll see if we learn something as a result.

476
00:23:40,926 --> 00:23:43,968
The problem here is that if you take crappy studies

477
00:23:43,968 --> 00:23:46,169
and put them together, you just get a really big,

478
00:23:46,169 --> 00:23:48,251
really crappy study.

479
00:23:48,251 --> 00:23:51,252
This is my whole talk, Mia, is meta-studies.

480
00:23:51,252 --> 00:23:53,013
You're just killing me here, you're killing me.

481
00:23:53,013 --> 00:23:57,696
So, yeah, another problem.

482
00:23:57,696 --> 00:23:58,196
Thank you, Roger.

483
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:05,142
Another problem with these meta-analysis is a lot of them focus on research that has been published.

484
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:12,764
There is a publication bias many times. If you do a study and you find like no significant results,

485
00:24:12,764 --> 00:24:16,084
a lot of journals don't want to publish it because it doesn't seem very exciting,

486
00:24:16,084 --> 00:24:20,645
even though in like violence research no significant results might be important.

487
00:24:20,645 --> 00:24:25,246
And so you're leaving out those studies and their lack of results.

488
00:24:26,027 --> 00:24:28,489
Scientists have different ways of interpreting the results,

489
00:24:28,489 --> 00:24:31,270
what one might consider a moderate effect,

490
00:24:31,270 --> 00:24:34,353
one might consider a minor effect.

491
00:24:34,353 --> 00:24:36,674
And so again, there's just no clear-cut consensus.

492
00:24:36,674 --> 00:24:38,976
Some are very convinced of their truth,

493
00:24:38,976 --> 00:24:41,638
but there is no complete consensus overall.

494
00:24:42,986 --> 00:24:45,869
I'm kind of over time, so just getting really nitpicky.

495
00:24:45,869 --> 00:24:46,569
Not all games are violent.

496
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:50,253
People don't always play them just for the violent parts.

497
00:24:50,253 --> 00:24:52,635
The research tends to conflate research

498
00:24:52,635 --> 00:24:57,199
on little kids, young kids, 17-year-olds, and adults

499
00:24:57,199 --> 00:24:58,560
without separating them out

500
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,962
and how they might be different.

501
00:25:00,962 --> 00:25:03,164
Some of the studies don't really mention

502
00:25:03,164 --> 00:25:05,146
our women and girls involved.

503
00:25:05,146 --> 00:25:06,648
A few do, but not all of them,

504
00:25:06,648 --> 00:25:08,990
so we don't really know conclusively about gender.

505
00:25:09,890 --> 00:25:12,171
And just to close up, another way to approach this

506
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:16,213
is to ask, what do people do with games?

507
00:25:16,213 --> 00:25:18,134
How are they using them in their lives?

508
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:19,714
What are they taking away from them?

509
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:22,215
What are they bringing to them?

510
00:25:22,215 --> 00:25:24,516
Rather than asking, what do games do to people?

511
00:25:24,516 --> 00:25:24,777
Thanks.

512
00:25:45,524 --> 00:25:57,511
Perfect.

513
00:25:57,511 --> 00:25:59,032
Thank you, Doc.

514
00:25:59,032 --> 00:26:00,993
Appreciate it.

515
00:26:01,448 --> 00:26:04,131
I'm Roger. It's nice to see everyone here.

516
00:26:04,131 --> 00:26:04,971
I collect titles.

517
00:26:04,971 --> 00:26:07,374
I work at Queensland University of Technology,

518
00:26:07,374 --> 00:26:09,436
Entertainment Arts and Engineering at Utah,

519
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:12,119
and all sorts of other fun things.

520
00:26:12,119 --> 00:26:13,660
I like that workaholism.

521
00:26:14,601 --> 00:26:21,787
I'm a lucky guy. I get to work with talented people and talented students to make games.

522
00:26:21,787 --> 00:26:26,291
Sometimes they're for entertainment and sometimes they are for health.

523
00:26:26,291 --> 00:26:30,855
And so we have a lab that we work in where we're making games in a hospital

524
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,278
to sort of help people with all sorts of different things,

525
00:26:33,278 --> 00:26:38,322
ranging from helping disabled people ski again and or sail again.

526
00:26:38,462 --> 00:26:42,704
to doing all sorts of things with medication compliance and things like that.

527
00:26:42,704 --> 00:26:47,066
So I sort of have a vested interest in this notion, just to put all my biases out there,

528
00:26:47,066 --> 00:26:51,348
about games as an industry and prepping people to work in a games industry,

529
00:26:51,348 --> 00:26:54,530
and then also games as medicine, and that games are good for you.

530
00:26:54,530 --> 00:26:58,772
In fact, I have done a lot of talks when I first started doing work in medicine

531
00:26:58,772 --> 00:27:01,993
on are games good for you and how can games help people out.

532
00:27:03,143 --> 00:27:06,624
People love talking about the negative aspects of games.

533
00:27:06,624 --> 00:27:08,905
I think that came through in the previous talks,

534
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,505
and there's been lots of it.

535
00:27:10,505 --> 00:27:14,766
I think if you just, if you Google games are bad for you,

536
00:27:14,766 --> 00:27:16,407
lots of fun stuff pops up, right?

537
00:27:16,407 --> 00:27:18,627
So there's like no lack of it.

538
00:27:18,627 --> 00:27:21,008
But oddly enough, lots of good stuff pops up as well.

539
00:27:21,008 --> 00:27:22,829
And I think this is one of the shifts

540
00:27:22,829 --> 00:27:24,649
that we're starting to see,

541
00:27:24,649 --> 00:27:28,110
that you would be surprised who is writing

542
00:27:28,110 --> 00:27:30,831
about the positive impacts of games, right?

543
00:27:31,091 --> 00:27:33,652
and the kinds of things that they're asking about.

544
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:35,532
So like, for example, on the vegan article,

545
00:27:35,532 --> 00:27:37,912
they're talking about games are good for you,

546
00:27:37,912 --> 00:27:39,573
lots of reasons why games are good for you.

547
00:27:39,573 --> 00:27:41,693
A call for responsible play,

548
00:27:41,693 --> 00:27:43,894
so this emphasis on personal responsibility,

549
00:27:43,894 --> 00:27:45,414
that's an important shift.

550
00:27:45,414 --> 00:27:47,275
And we're gonna talk about that a little bit,

551
00:27:47,275 --> 00:27:51,095
how we stop looking at the stimuli or the thing itself,

552
00:27:51,095 --> 00:27:52,756
and we start looking at behavior

553
00:27:52,756 --> 00:27:54,316
and responsible behavior, right?

554
00:27:54,316 --> 00:27:55,536
I mean, of course, the same concerns

555
00:27:55,536 --> 00:27:56,637
that everyone always has,

556
00:27:56,637 --> 00:27:58,917
but it's an interesting shift to see what happens.

557
00:27:59,921 --> 00:28:03,762
It's already been addressed that there is negative,

558
00:28:03,762 --> 00:28:05,702
there is great academic work on games

559
00:28:05,702 --> 00:28:07,483
on sort of both sides of this debate,

560
00:28:07,483 --> 00:28:09,423
if you believe there are two sides.

561
00:28:09,423 --> 00:28:11,204
Really, there's just a lot of thought on there.

562
00:28:11,204 --> 00:28:13,584
It's kind of hard to boil it down into two camps.

563
00:28:13,584 --> 00:28:16,565
And on addiction, though, we're seeing a shift

564
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:18,085
in the way people talk about addiction.

565
00:28:18,085 --> 00:28:21,486
So in the beginning, people liked to talk about media

566
00:28:21,486 --> 00:28:22,846
in the same ways that they would talk

567
00:28:22,846 --> 00:28:24,106
about addictive substances.

568
00:28:24,106 --> 00:28:25,467
So you would talk about games the same way

569
00:28:25,467 --> 00:28:28,908
you might talk about a chemical substance or a drug, right?

570
00:28:29,988 --> 00:28:33,389
And certainly they could point to lots of negative things

571
00:28:33,389 --> 00:28:34,509
that happen around games.

572
00:28:34,509 --> 00:28:37,570
And I think it's important for us, when we talk about games,

573
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,591
especially when we talk about games in the press,

574
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:42,332
not to sort of sweep these things under the rugs.

575
00:28:42,332 --> 00:28:45,113
Whether it's through academic study or anecdotes,

576
00:28:45,113 --> 00:28:49,514
people have stories about negative things

577
00:28:49,514 --> 00:28:51,695
around game play, right?

578
00:28:52,215 --> 00:28:56,256
Just as we laugh when we talk about negative things around driving, we don't have to hide that.

579
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:58,777
We don't have to say driving is good all the time.

580
00:28:58,777 --> 00:29:03,878
That every time you get behind the wheel of a car, it's a delightful experience, right?

581
00:29:03,878 --> 00:29:07,639
Mia wants to kill people apparently when she gets behind the wheel of a car,

582
00:29:07,639 --> 00:29:10,039
so I'm going to add that bullet point to this slide, right?

583
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:17,561
And I think that when we talk about negative aspects of leisure or negative aspects of games, in particular, is leisure,

584
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,511
We're not alone in this.

585
00:29:19,511 --> 00:29:21,252
So one of the things that we don't hear much about

586
00:29:21,252 --> 00:29:22,353
is exercise addiction, right?

587
00:29:22,353 --> 00:29:25,375
And exercise addiction isn't a new thing.

588
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:27,857
This is something that's been studied since the 70s.

589
00:29:27,857 --> 00:29:30,118
There are places where you can be treated

590
00:29:30,118 --> 00:29:30,799
for exercise addiction.

591
00:29:30,799 --> 00:29:34,621
There are lots of great articles on exercise addiction.

592
00:29:34,621 --> 00:29:38,263
Being an exercise addict is a very serious condition.

593
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:40,125
It can affect your body in tremendous ways.

594
00:29:40,125 --> 00:29:41,205
It reduces your longevity.

595
00:29:41,205 --> 00:29:43,327
It can compromise your immune system.

596
00:29:43,327 --> 00:29:44,848
There are all sorts of terrible things that happen.

597
00:29:45,248 --> 00:29:48,310
But when we talk about exercise, this isn't what comes up, right?

598
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:53,753
We don't talk about exercise addiction when we have general conversations about exercise.

599
00:29:53,753 --> 00:29:57,695
And the reason for that is because exercise is good for you.

600
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:00,056
This is known, right?

601
00:30:00,056 --> 00:30:03,518
Even though it is addictive, even though people get hurt by it.

602
00:30:03,958 --> 00:30:11,001
Even though some of the cultures around where we do exercise are very complicated and under

603
00:30:11,001 --> 00:30:15,062
debate right now, the idea that when we talk about exercise, if I were to say, hey, let's

604
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:18,543
talk about exercise, none of you are going to say, oh, that's terrible.

605
00:30:18,543 --> 00:30:20,564
Exercise is the worst.

606
00:30:20,564 --> 00:30:22,685
It's addictive, and you might be exposed to toxic.

607
00:30:22,785 --> 00:30:27,789
cultures, and oh my god, exercise, don't get me started, right?

608
00:30:27,789 --> 00:30:31,632
No, because you walk with the assumption that exercise is good for you.

609
00:30:31,632 --> 00:30:37,056
And so we can actually have conversations about those things and not worry that we're

610
00:30:37,056 --> 00:30:42,401
going to get rid of exercise and start having gym membership burning parties.

611
00:30:42,401 --> 00:30:46,003
I mean, I don't even know what that would look like, right?

612
00:30:46,003 --> 00:30:49,907
So what if instead of always apologizing for games, we started with something else?

613
00:30:49,907 --> 00:30:52,148
What if we started with games are good for you?

614
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:54,600
What if that was the assumption?

615
00:30:54,600 --> 00:30:58,846
And so to get to this notion that games are good for you,

616
00:30:58,846 --> 00:31:02,511
we might have to start talking about the things about games

617
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:04,253
that are good for you,

618
00:31:04,253 --> 00:31:06,496
not just the right to be entertained,

619
00:31:06,496 --> 00:31:08,118
that is a valuable thing,

620
00:31:08,118 --> 00:31:09,761
or to engage and lead your time.

621
00:31:10,081 --> 00:31:12,443
But are there things about games that are good for you?

622
00:31:12,443 --> 00:31:15,065
There are lots of great individual studies

623
00:31:15,065 --> 00:31:18,187
on this kind of stuff, both from social scientific

624
00:31:18,187 --> 00:31:19,208
and medical research.

625
00:31:19,208 --> 00:31:22,410
This, for example, is a single study on the game Bejeweled

626
00:31:22,410 --> 00:31:26,593
that shows that it has the impact that playing Bejeweled

627
00:31:26,593 --> 00:31:28,315
for 30 minutes a day three times a week

628
00:31:28,635 --> 00:31:32,498
has the same impact on state and trait anxiety.

629
00:31:32,498 --> 00:31:34,660
State anxiety is what we all experience

630
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:37,122
when you get stressed out when something bad happens.

631
00:31:37,122 --> 00:31:39,985
Or trait anxiety, you just deal with generalized anxiety.

632
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:43,108
It has the same impact as low dose benzos.

633
00:31:43,108 --> 00:31:46,551
So low dose Valium or low dose Xanax, right?

634
00:31:46,551 --> 00:31:48,513
And that it's a wonderful study

635
00:31:48,513 --> 00:31:50,234
because they do all this biometric stuff.

636
00:31:50,234 --> 00:31:51,816
It's a good study.

637
00:31:51,816 --> 00:31:54,138
And they sort of show that unlike a lot of things

638
00:31:54,138 --> 00:31:54,978
that are prescribed,

639
00:31:55,239 --> 00:31:56,579
Like people don't take their medications

640
00:31:56,579 --> 00:31:57,720
when they're prescribed to them.

641
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,582
When they were prescribed to video games,

642
00:31:59,582 --> 00:32:02,404
they took them more than the recommended dosage.

643
00:32:02,404 --> 00:32:04,865
And so they were prescribed a half hour of play.

644
00:32:04,865 --> 00:32:07,527
Average amount of play was just over 40 minutes.

645
00:32:07,527 --> 00:32:09,589
So get your bejeweled on.

646
00:32:09,589 --> 00:32:13,171
But rather than looking at a bunch of individual studies,

647
00:32:13,171 --> 00:32:15,673
Mia already alluded to that meta studies and meta reviews

648
00:32:15,673 --> 00:32:19,035
are wonderful and extraordinarily useful.

649
00:32:19,035 --> 00:32:22,318
And there's just never anything to critique about them.

650
00:32:24,484 --> 00:32:26,064
We looked at each other's work, I swear.

651
00:32:26,064 --> 00:32:34,548
But in reality, though, this is actually a great place to start when you want to start

652
00:32:34,548 --> 00:32:36,129
looking for research, our meta-reviews.

653
00:32:36,129 --> 00:32:40,411
So a good meta-review, like this is a report that was sponsored by a center in Australia,

654
00:32:40,411 --> 00:32:42,812
and they looked at 200 different articles.

655
00:32:43,312 --> 00:32:50,477
on well-being and children and games and sort of extract themes from it, right? And so it's a good

656
00:32:50,477 --> 00:32:54,960
place to sort of start the conversation. Clearly, these things are never definitive, right? But they

657
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:59,823
looked at a lot of research, like we said, over 200 peer-reviewed published articles,

658
00:32:59,823 --> 00:33:01,644
again, with caveats for all the things that Mia mentioned.

659
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:04,944
And they sort of talked about positive emotional impacts

660
00:33:04,944 --> 00:33:07,488
of games, the healthy relationships that come

661
00:33:07,488 --> 00:33:09,190
from games, and social capital.

662
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:11,794
Social capital is sort of the things

663
00:33:11,794 --> 00:33:14,498
we use in life to exchange with one another

664
00:33:14,498 --> 00:33:17,122
that aren't monetary related but are cool.

665
00:33:17,122 --> 00:33:18,444
So you could say, hey, look at.

666
00:33:18,810 --> 00:33:23,015
I have a really cool mount or I'm really high level and wow.

667
00:33:23,015 --> 00:33:25,498
And other people might say, oh, that's really great.

668
00:33:25,498 --> 00:33:27,760
So that's social capital that you can exchange, right?

669
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:29,803
And then the impact on self-esteem,

670
00:33:29,803 --> 00:33:31,565
the positive impact on self-esteem.

671
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:33,687
The citation for this will also be on the website that's

672
00:33:33,687 --> 00:33:34,749
on that handout if you need it.

673
00:33:35,810 --> 00:33:40,194
But when we talked about the positive emotional impact or when that article talks about it,

674
00:33:40,194 --> 00:33:45,659
they sort of looked at mental well-being with video games, that it's a good way to relax,

675
00:33:45,659 --> 00:33:47,181
it's a good way to not feel stressed out.

676
00:33:47,181 --> 00:33:52,406
These are things that you might already believe, but there's research that talks about this,

677
00:33:52,406 --> 00:33:57,431
that people who play games tend not to have depressed mood as much.

678
00:33:58,051 --> 00:34:03,653
Oddly enough, a lot of the research has a horseshoe-shaped pattern, meaning that those

679
00:34:03,653 --> 00:34:09,975
who don't play games and those who play excessive amounts of games have depressive mood problems.

680
00:34:09,975 --> 00:34:14,957
But those that play moderate games have less of this than people who don't play games.

681
00:34:14,957 --> 00:34:15,297
Right?

682
00:34:15,297 --> 00:34:17,738
And we actually see this with obesity as well.

683
00:34:18,218 --> 00:34:22,562
that there's arguments about obesity in games and that those who don't play games and those

684
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:27,245
who play excessive games are more likely to suffer from childhood obesity than those who

685
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,146
play moderate amounts of games as well.

686
00:34:29,146 --> 00:34:31,068
So that pattern seems to emerge a lot.

687
00:34:32,022 --> 00:34:37,148
That in terms of healthy relationships, that people who play games tend to have less risky

688
00:34:37,148 --> 00:34:43,654
friendship networks, high levels of family closeness, and that people in games like WoW

689
00:34:43,654 --> 00:34:48,359
are sometimes they find this a safe space to discuss things that might be difficult

690
00:34:48,359 --> 00:34:50,241
for them to discuss.

691
00:34:50,942 --> 00:34:51,882
interpersonally, right?

692
00:34:51,882 --> 00:34:54,524
And so the use of avatars, the use of the game

693
00:34:54,524 --> 00:34:57,326
means that they can sort of talk about things in their life

694
00:34:57,326 --> 00:35:00,028
that they might be uncomfortable talking about IRL.

695
00:35:00,028 --> 00:35:03,370
This is actually true in other studies as well.

696
00:35:03,370 --> 00:35:07,713
So with adults, with adults who have returned from war

697
00:35:07,713 --> 00:35:10,595
and are suffering from PTSD, there's been great work

698
00:35:10,595 --> 00:35:12,276
that some people are more comfortable talking

699
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,918
to a virtual counselor than a real counselor,

700
00:35:13,918 --> 00:35:17,360
that they can be more honest and more forthcoming

701
00:35:17,360 --> 00:35:19,702
with an avatar than they can another person in the room.

702
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:27,795
In terms of self-esteem, we sort of see that a lot of players feel they can express themselves

703
00:35:27,795 --> 00:35:28,156
more.

704
00:35:28,156 --> 00:35:33,742
They feel empowered and confident to express their sexuality, their appearance.

705
00:35:33,742 --> 00:35:35,624
They're not afraid of these things.

706
00:35:35,624 --> 00:35:39,429
And that virtual worlds can sort of give people a break from this stuff.

707
00:35:40,180 --> 00:35:42,201
This is not the only meta review on this.

708
00:35:42,201 --> 00:35:43,862
There's lots of them.

709
00:35:43,862 --> 00:35:45,362
This one is pretty interesting, though,

710
00:35:45,362 --> 00:35:48,103
because it was published by the APA, the American

711
00:35:48,103 --> 00:35:50,925
Psychological Association, in their premier journal,

712
00:35:50,925 --> 00:35:52,245
American Psychologist.

713
00:35:52,245 --> 00:35:54,786
The American Psychological Association

714
00:35:54,786 --> 00:35:56,467
has a complex relationship with games.

715
00:35:56,467 --> 00:35:59,408
They've come out on the other side of this games addiction

716
00:35:59,408 --> 00:36:00,508
debate in the past.

717
00:36:00,849 --> 00:36:05,496
And so you might have seen news articles that say things like, American Psychological Association

718
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:06,978
has concerns about games addiction.

719
00:36:06,978 --> 00:36:12,446
But at the same time, they are publishing work on the healthy benefits of playing games

720
00:36:12,446 --> 00:36:15,310
in their major journal, which is pretty interesting.

721
00:36:15,670 --> 00:36:17,852
So this is another article that sort of analyzes

722
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:19,573
dozens of other articles.

723
00:36:19,573 --> 00:36:22,235
And instead of saying, what are the social aspects of it,

724
00:36:22,235 --> 00:36:25,256
it says that there are cognitive benefits to games,

725
00:36:25,256 --> 00:36:27,578
that the types of things that we learn,

726
00:36:27,578 --> 00:36:30,060
in fact, they do a really interesting analysis

727
00:36:30,060 --> 00:36:32,581
of articles about first-person shooters

728
00:36:32,581 --> 00:36:35,263
that show that playing first-person shooters

729
00:36:35,263 --> 00:36:38,025
teaches you spatial reasoning and other skills

730
00:36:38,025 --> 00:36:40,446
at the same level as taking high-level college courses

731
00:36:40,446 --> 00:36:40,846
in them.

732
00:36:41,167 --> 00:36:42,887
that they're good for motivation,

733
00:36:42,887 --> 00:36:44,528
that they're good for emotional health,

734
00:36:44,528 --> 00:36:45,568
and that they're very social.

735
00:36:45,568 --> 00:36:47,768
So it's a great review of these kinds of things.

736
00:36:47,768 --> 00:36:50,849
But the point of it isn't these articles

737
00:36:50,849 --> 00:36:52,890
that I'm talking about, it's that we

738
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:57,571
don't have to dismiss that maybe some people who play games

739
00:36:57,571 --> 00:37:01,252
have bad experiences or that bad things happen to them

740
00:37:01,252 --> 00:37:02,072
around games.

741
00:37:02,072 --> 00:37:04,773
We would be lying if that were the case, right?

742
00:37:06,125 --> 00:37:09,247
No one hates love, but clearly people have been hurt in love.

743
00:37:09,247 --> 00:37:11,628
There wouldn't be a pop music industry

744
00:37:11,628 --> 00:37:13,209
if people didn't get hurt in love.

745
00:37:13,209 --> 00:37:17,831
But that talking about the positive aspects of games

746
00:37:17,831 --> 00:37:22,233
might get us to a place where we can say games are good for you

747
00:37:22,233 --> 00:37:24,634
and still have honest conversations about everything

748
00:37:24,634 --> 00:37:24,874
else.

749
00:37:24,874 --> 00:37:28,816
And that just because some people have a bad experience,

750
00:37:28,816 --> 00:37:30,577
it doesn't mean that's a defining characteristic

751
00:37:30,577 --> 00:37:32,538
of the thing itself.

752
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:37,658
Um, that's all I have for you. You feel free to email me any questions you might have. Thank you.

753
00:38:00,957 --> 00:38:06,240
Yeah, all right, so now I got sucked this panel with the the joy of going right after Roger

754
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:11,482
It's always interesting so my name is Andy. I also collect titles

755
00:38:11,482 --> 00:38:16,905
I'm a professor of human interface technology at Canterbury, which is a Christ Church

756
00:38:16,905 --> 00:38:18,826
I'm also a professor of art and design at RIT

757
00:38:19,560 --> 00:38:22,422
I'm a game scholar and resident at American right now.

758
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:25,805
And probably most relevant to this particular talk,

759
00:38:25,805 --> 00:38:28,647
I'm president of the Higher Education Video Game Alliance.

760
00:38:28,647 --> 00:38:33,090
And I became president of the Higher Education Video Game

761
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:36,852
Alliance about mid-2017, around Thanksgiving time.

762
00:38:36,852 --> 00:38:37,793
It was really nice.

763
00:38:37,793 --> 00:38:39,834
My very good friend and colleague

764
00:38:39,834 --> 00:38:42,036
was the prior president, Constance Steinkuhler.

765
00:38:42,771 --> 00:38:45,192
and we were kind of discussing as a board

766
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:47,154
like who was gonna take it on next

767
00:38:47,154 --> 00:38:49,095
and she talked me into it,

768
00:38:49,095 --> 00:38:51,156
as she has a way of doing.

769
00:38:51,156 --> 00:38:53,698
And she said, well, I just, I wanna tell you, right,

770
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:56,980
like, you know, I think you're gonna have

771
00:38:56,980 --> 00:39:00,003
a pretty smooth sailing here with your tenure with HFGA,

772
00:39:00,003 --> 00:39:01,944
like it's not gonna be that big of a deal

773
00:39:01,944 --> 00:39:03,805
because when I, she used to be assigned

774
00:39:03,805 --> 00:39:05,807
to the Office of Science and Technology Policy

775
00:39:05,807 --> 00:39:07,208
at the White House, and she said,

776
00:39:07,208 --> 00:39:10,030
when we were there, right, Sandy Hook happened.

777
00:39:11,575 --> 00:39:15,598
and we got called to a meeting in Joe Biden's office

778
00:39:15,598 --> 00:39:16,919
to talk about video games.

779
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:19,961
So if that doesn't happen to you,

780
00:39:19,961 --> 00:39:22,463
like, you know, like you're gonna have an easier time

781
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:24,804
of it than I did, right?

782
00:39:24,804 --> 00:39:26,585
So it's gonna be okay.

783
00:39:26,585 --> 00:39:27,926
And so that was fun.

784
00:39:27,926 --> 00:39:30,848
And then it got to be about January

785
00:39:30,848 --> 00:39:35,671
and we had another school shooting

786
00:39:35,671 --> 00:39:39,614
and the president of the United States opened his mouth

787
00:39:40,163 --> 00:39:44,265
about how that was the fault of video games.

788
00:39:44,265 --> 00:39:47,247
So it took three months.

789
00:39:47,247 --> 00:39:47,827
Great.

790
00:39:47,827 --> 00:39:48,688
That was really super.

791
00:39:48,688 --> 00:39:53,111
I particularly do enjoy the fact, though,

792
00:39:53,111 --> 00:39:54,191
that his tweet was actually from 2012

793
00:39:54,191 --> 00:39:57,353
that everyone referenced in response to that debate.

794
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,494
It was pretty great.

795
00:39:59,494 --> 00:40:03,597
So pretty much then, everything old is new again again.

796
00:40:03,597 --> 00:40:07,139
That's what happened in Washington

797
00:40:07,139 --> 00:40:09,620
in the wake of the shooting in Florida.

798
00:40:11,306 --> 00:40:18,208
And so what was interesting and a little bit different though was I got a bunch of folks in the industry saying

799
00:40:18,208 --> 00:40:19,869
It'll blow over

800
00:40:19,869 --> 00:40:21,870
This always happens

801
00:40:21,870 --> 00:40:29,173
like we shouldn't worry about issuing statements and you know coming out on on these sides of these issues and and this that and the

802
00:40:29,173 --> 00:40:32,034
Other and and then eventually right like Trump said no

803
00:40:32,034 --> 00:40:37,356
we're gonna have a meeting in the White House and we're gonna make the game executives show up and answer for this and that that uh that

804
00:40:37,876 --> 00:40:41,159
and then they had that meeting and basically everybody yelled at each other

805
00:40:41,159 --> 00:40:45,483
and nobody was you know it wasn't like I mean the optics of having a meeting at

806
00:40:45,483 --> 00:40:47,926
the White House sort of means you're gonna yell at each other because that

807
00:40:47,926 --> 00:40:51,109
makes for a better news story. But that's

808
00:40:51,109 --> 00:40:54,832
you know kinda what happened right except that

809
00:40:54,832 --> 00:40:56,534
in the background of all of that

810
00:40:56,893 --> 00:40:59,094
There's some really interesting things that happened.

811
00:40:59,094 --> 00:41:01,395
So one was that issue got referred

812
00:41:01,395 --> 00:41:03,296
to the Commission for School Safety

813
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:05,457
that had to issue a report back to the president

814
00:41:05,457 --> 00:41:07,257
over the course of the next year, the School Safety

815
00:41:07,257 --> 00:41:08,658
Commission Report.

816
00:41:08,658 --> 00:41:10,538
I'm willing to bet that most of you have not read it.

817
00:41:10,538 --> 00:41:12,039
It's pretty dry.

818
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:13,159
Got to be honest.

819
00:41:13,159 --> 00:41:17,701
One of the things that's interesting about that,

820
00:41:17,701 --> 00:41:21,022
though, is that it specifically calls out the Motion Picture

821
00:41:21,022 --> 00:41:24,483
Association of America and their rating systems as inadequate.

822
00:41:25,374 --> 00:41:27,295
but it does not call out video games.

823
00:41:27,295 --> 00:41:30,276
And one of the reasons for that is that there was a bunch

824
00:41:30,276 --> 00:41:32,636
of sustained advocacy behind the fact

825
00:41:32,636 --> 00:41:36,558
because organizations like mine, like the ESA,

826
00:41:36,558 --> 00:41:39,118
like the IGDA were making those articles

827
00:41:39,118 --> 00:41:42,479
that said the research is not conclusive, right,

828
00:41:42,479 --> 00:41:45,560
that violent video games causes school shootings, right?

829
00:41:45,560 --> 00:41:49,362
And so that was a very necessary point of advocacy

830
00:41:49,362 --> 00:41:52,883
to continue to protect this medium that we love.

831
00:41:54,848 --> 00:41:57,131
And I just talked over my next slide.

832
00:41:57,131 --> 00:41:58,612
So how does this affect you?

833
00:41:58,612 --> 00:42:02,876
Well, it affects you because if they decided that it did,

834
00:42:02,876 --> 00:42:06,179
we could all be legislated out of making

835
00:42:06,179 --> 00:42:09,182
certain kinds of content pretty darn quickly.

836
00:42:09,182 --> 00:42:14,808
We have a really great precedent with the Supreme Court case.

837
00:42:15,318 --> 00:42:21,160
from a few years ago about games being first-person projected speech and all of that. I don't

838
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,342
know if you've noticed this, but the balance of the court has shifted a little bit since

839
00:42:26,342 --> 00:42:31,885
that was tried. I'm not willing to go down the road and say it'll always be upheld. You

840
00:42:31,885 --> 00:42:41,529
never know. And then, okay, so that was like my first three months on the job.

841
00:42:42,392 --> 00:42:44,433
And then we had this.

842
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:46,794
Winning.

843
00:42:46,794 --> 00:42:48,695
So then the World Health Organization

844
00:42:48,695 --> 00:42:51,416
comes out and says we're going to have a classification

845
00:42:51,416 --> 00:42:53,737
around addiction in games.

846
00:42:53,737 --> 00:42:57,720
And I watched a bunch of my academic colleagues

847
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,862
who just did the very same thing that we kind of did

848
00:43:01,862 --> 00:43:02,802
with games and violence.

849
00:43:02,802 --> 00:43:04,363
It said the research is not clear,

850
00:43:04,363 --> 00:43:06,064
that the studies are this and this.

851
00:43:06,624 --> 00:43:11,428
You know, it's going to take a long time to figure this stuff out and this kind of research

852
00:43:11,428 --> 00:43:14,950
is very difficult and it's not definitive and so on and so forth, right?

853
00:43:14,950 --> 00:43:19,093
And I was sitting here on mailing list watching colleagues that said that those very things

854
00:43:19,093 --> 00:43:23,156
about violence turn around and say, yeah, but man, kids can't stop playing Fortnite.

855
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:26,679
Like, we got to do something about this, like right now.

856
00:43:26,679 --> 00:43:28,820
And you're like, but, but the.

857
00:43:29,210 --> 00:43:34,479
You know, if you're really into that particular issue, right,

858
00:43:34,479 --> 00:43:36,902
there's a, I would tell you there's a really great panel

859
00:43:36,902 --> 00:43:39,426
discussion at Games for Change in 2018.

860
00:43:39,426 --> 00:43:42,411
And the woman in that's very dark on there.

861
00:43:43,405 --> 00:43:49,787
is Kelly Dunlop and you should check her out because her work in this space is probably some of the the most

862
00:43:49,787 --> 00:43:51,288
down-to-earth and reasonable

863
00:43:51,288 --> 00:43:56,449
Around what addiction you know addiction is a really loaded word, right?

864
00:43:56,449 --> 00:43:58,810
There's a medical classification for it

865
00:43:58,810 --> 00:44:01,631
But the way we use it popularly has very little to do with that

866
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:08,799
And so that's an issue. Behind the scenes, if you're in and out of D.C. the way I am, the way you have been,

867
00:44:08,799 --> 00:44:13,025
one of the things you will notice is the standard age of the American lawmaker.

868
00:44:17,513 --> 00:44:19,234
And there are some big generational divides

869
00:44:19,234 --> 00:44:20,695
regarding attitudes about games.

870
00:44:20,695 --> 00:44:24,499
So we all love these little stats, right,

871
00:44:24,499 --> 00:44:27,541
that's like, everybody plays games, right?

872
00:44:27,541 --> 00:44:30,083
There's, you know, like 97% of everyone ever plays games

873
00:44:30,083 --> 00:44:32,085
and we've been playing games since the dawn of time

874
00:44:32,085 --> 00:44:33,246
and all this kind of stuff.

875
00:44:33,246 --> 00:44:35,608
But we play very different kinds of games

876
00:44:35,608 --> 00:44:40,071
based on our age a lot, right?

877
00:44:40,071 --> 00:44:43,594
We classify a lot of things in American politics

878
00:44:43,594 --> 00:44:46,136
as this left-right debate, right?

879
00:44:46,136 --> 00:44:46,897
But the real debate...

880
00:44:48,029 --> 00:44:50,451
is old young, right?

881
00:44:50,451 --> 00:44:52,953
And so this was a really interesting article

882
00:44:52,953 --> 00:44:55,235
that just came out not too terribly long ago

883
00:44:55,235 --> 00:44:57,256
about the eligible voters and their age.

884
00:44:57,256 --> 00:45:00,198
And what you see is that there are some really,

885
00:45:00,198 --> 00:45:02,841
really big generations that are, you know,

886
00:45:02,841 --> 00:45:04,702
in like early retirement age right now.

887
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:08,485
And that's not going to phase out until like after 2045.

888
00:45:08,485 --> 00:45:13,669
Right? So the way that we talk about media,

889
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:15,891
kind of there's some issues there.

890
00:45:16,505 --> 00:45:20,870
The other thing that I think is really interesting is that we're all at GDC and we're all developers

891
00:45:20,870 --> 00:45:24,794
and we make games and we know how games are made and we know some of the motivations behind

892
00:45:24,794 --> 00:45:28,499
them and what the industry kind of looks like a little bit and so on and so forth.

893
00:45:28,499 --> 00:45:31,342
This is how most people think games get made.

894
00:45:34,375 --> 00:45:38,099
Right? So there's an idea person and then elves and then game.

895
00:45:38,099 --> 00:45:43,385
Right? Just talk to like freshmen that come into games programs.

896
00:45:43,385 --> 00:45:45,287
Right? They're like, I want to be the idea guy.

897
00:45:45,287 --> 00:45:46,488
Right? Like, you know.

898
00:45:46,488 --> 00:45:52,594
Right? So there just, there isn't this public narrative about how games get made.

899
00:45:52,594 --> 00:45:54,857
And yet when you think about film, right?

900
00:45:55,911 --> 00:46:02,713
like a three-year-old knows that there's actors and a script

901
00:46:02,713 --> 00:46:05,274
and that gets turned into a thing, right?

902
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:07,455
And then you say, well, how does a game get made?

903
00:46:07,455 --> 00:46:08,475
I don't really know, right?

904
00:46:08,475 --> 00:46:10,736
Something with a computer, I think, right?

905
00:46:10,736 --> 00:46:14,297
So it's no wonder that they're trying to,

906
00:46:14,297 --> 00:46:16,738
that there's a lot of fear and moral panic

907
00:46:16,738 --> 00:46:18,118
around what these things do to us

908
00:46:18,118 --> 00:46:20,739
because they don't understand how they're made,

909
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:22,780
what they are, and how they're being consumed,

910
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:23,740
and thus their effect.

911
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:27,217
We've talked a lot about some big national examples,

912
00:46:27,217 --> 00:46:30,019
but the way this trickles down, it can be state by state,

913
00:46:30,019 --> 00:46:34,463
it can be local district, it can be how games are perceived

914
00:46:34,463 --> 00:46:38,046
by the librarian at your local library, right?

915
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:40,828
It can be like Vermont just tried to ban the sale

916
00:46:40,828 --> 00:46:42,289
of violent video games independently.

917
00:46:43,670 --> 00:46:45,271
just as a state legislature action.

918
00:46:45,271 --> 00:46:47,772
And that fortunately died on the governor's desk

919
00:46:47,772 --> 00:46:49,953
because there's really no way to enforce it presently.

920
00:46:49,953 --> 00:46:52,494
But it was an interesting piece of legislation

921
00:46:52,494 --> 00:46:55,676
to see just kind of float right out there.

922
00:46:55,676 --> 00:46:59,117
There's some efforts right now to legislate loot crates

923
00:46:59,117 --> 00:47:02,199
starting out of Hawaii, so on and so forth.

924
00:47:02,199 --> 00:47:05,020
So what I would say to you is that if we

925
00:47:05,020 --> 00:47:07,541
profess to really care about this medium,

926
00:47:07,541 --> 00:47:09,142
to aspire to games as art.

927
00:47:09,742 --> 00:47:11,844
and to hold ourselves to the highest academic

928
00:47:11,844 --> 00:47:13,105
and professional standards,

929
00:47:13,105 --> 00:47:16,347
then that also means using the knowledge that we have

930
00:47:16,347 --> 00:47:19,109
and the passion for this medium that we hold, right,

931
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,011
to defend it, right?

932
00:47:21,011 --> 00:47:23,633
It means not being silent, right?

933
00:47:23,633 --> 00:47:25,294
And a lot of times we're silent because like,

934
00:47:25,294 --> 00:47:26,495
well, if we say the wrong thing,

935
00:47:26,495 --> 00:47:27,636
like it's gonna go on Twitter

936
00:47:27,636 --> 00:47:30,418
and then bad things happen and so on, right?

937
00:47:30,418 --> 00:47:33,360
But if you don't say anything, right,

938
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:36,002
you're seeding a void for other people

939
00:47:36,002 --> 00:47:37,223
to fill in that discussion.

940
00:47:39,872 --> 00:47:41,733
I think Roger probably did it better than I did, right?

941
00:47:41,733 --> 00:47:47,178
But let's just remember that games have done some awesome things along the way for culture,

942
00:47:47,178 --> 00:47:51,361
both in education and just purely as a form of entertainment.

943
00:47:51,361 --> 00:47:53,643
So in conclusion, beware the media rumor.

944
00:47:54,103 --> 00:47:55,524
please, okay?

945
00:47:55,524 --> 00:47:58,764
A lot of popular press articles will take some

946
00:47:58,764 --> 00:48:01,165
of the academic work that like Mia was citing

947
00:48:01,165 --> 00:48:03,645
or that Roger was citing and pick out what they think

948
00:48:03,645 --> 00:48:05,126
would be a really nice headline,

949
00:48:05,126 --> 00:48:07,846
even if it doesn't exactly match what the study says, right?

950
00:48:07,846 --> 00:48:12,347
And then that gets condensed into a social media soundbite

951
00:48:12,347 --> 00:48:13,647
and so on and so forth, right?

952
00:48:13,647 --> 00:48:16,948
And so there's very little meat sometimes

953
00:48:16,948 --> 00:48:17,868
to what that looks like.

954
00:48:17,868 --> 00:48:20,268
And so remember that we've been here before.

955
00:48:20,609 --> 00:48:26,010
in our history of moral panics, particularly in this country, but also in others.

956
00:48:26,010 --> 00:48:29,151
Beware of unpublished or preliminary research,

957
00:48:29,151 --> 00:48:31,952
or research that had a particular sponsor with an agenda.

958
00:48:31,952 --> 00:48:36,854
You see that sometimes in this space. Most importantly, I think, is to seek some

959
00:48:36,854 --> 00:48:38,935
empathy with the motivations of parents.

960
00:48:40,088 --> 00:48:45,549
right? Because really I mean they just want their kids to be okay, right? That's the point,

961
00:48:45,549 --> 00:48:48,950
right? And so you know they're scared sometimes reading some of these articles or they're

962
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:52,671
scared that schools are getting shot up and you know this kind of stuff and so they're

963
00:48:52,671 --> 00:48:59,213
looking, they're knee jerking for answers that are easy that they think they have some

964
00:48:59,213 --> 00:49:04,274
control. Remember that you are an expert on the creation of games, right? Most people

965
00:49:04,274 --> 00:49:06,095
have no idea how they're made.

966
00:49:08,252 --> 00:49:10,694
Our relationship with games is complex.

967
00:49:10,694 --> 00:49:14,236
A lot of times the research is less clear than any headline

968
00:49:14,236 --> 00:49:15,096
will ever allow.

969
00:49:15,096 --> 00:49:18,838
The way we talk about games influences

970
00:49:18,838 --> 00:49:21,740
a lot of what is said about them and where the future research

971
00:49:21,740 --> 00:49:23,301
is targeted.

972
00:49:23,301 --> 00:49:27,363
So whatever the public debate around games

973
00:49:27,363 --> 00:49:29,124
shapes the kinds of research that's

974
00:49:29,124 --> 00:49:32,486
going to be funded the next time that money is allocated

975
00:49:32,486 --> 00:49:34,147
for research funding to look at this stuff.

976
00:49:36,970 --> 00:49:41,473
So what we say actually matters because that influences

977
00:49:41,473 --> 00:49:43,975
the things that we're going to be able to go and explore

978
00:49:43,975 --> 00:49:45,576
and hopefully find out.

979
00:49:45,576 --> 00:49:48,378
And you make a difference when you speak as a games creator,

980
00:49:48,378 --> 00:49:51,260
as a researcher, or as a professional.

981
00:49:51,260 --> 00:49:53,341
And like I said, a lot of the information

982
00:49:53,341 --> 00:49:56,143
that we packed into the panel is on this little website

983
00:49:56,143 --> 00:49:58,665
that we made, which is on the back of that card.

984
00:49:58,665 --> 00:50:03,368
And I'll also tweet the link after the talk and stuff.

985
00:50:03,368 --> 00:50:06,030
And with that, we get to the good stuff.

986
00:50:07,068 --> 00:50:09,450
So it's Q&A time.

987
00:50:09,450 --> 00:50:10,671
Do we have Q&A time?

988
00:50:10,671 --> 00:50:13,013
We have Q&A time.

989
00:50:13,013 --> 00:50:14,555
10 minutes.

990
00:50:16,312 --> 00:50:18,613
So we have short Q&A time, and so we would actually

991
00:50:18,613 --> 00:50:19,313
really appreciate it.

992
00:50:19,313 --> 00:50:20,293
And we do have a wrap-up room, too.

993
00:50:20,293 --> 00:50:21,893
Yeah, we have a wrap-up room.

994
00:50:21,893 --> 00:50:22,493
In 204.

995
00:50:22,493 --> 00:50:25,214
If you would ask questions rather than giving comments

996
00:50:25,214 --> 00:50:26,534
or micro-speeches.

997
00:50:26,534 --> 00:50:30,515
And so everyone will be so much happier if you do.

998
00:50:30,515 --> 00:50:36,136
And in fact, the best question gets a bag of kangaroo meat.

999
00:50:36,136 --> 00:50:38,016
So hop on up and ask a good question.

1000
00:50:38,016 --> 00:50:39,617
All the way from Australia.

1001
00:50:39,617 --> 00:50:40,317
It's from Australia.

1002
00:50:40,317 --> 00:50:41,117
Here you go.

1003
00:50:41,117 --> 00:50:41,857
97% Australian.

1004
00:50:41,857 --> 00:50:42,677
97% from Australia.

1005
00:50:42,677 --> 00:50:43,677
I'm more spicy sometimes.

1006
00:50:46,098 --> 00:50:47,399
What was the first question?

1007
00:50:47,399 --> 00:50:47,839
All right.

1008
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:51,741
So one topic that wasn't breached here is VR.

1009
00:50:51,741 --> 00:50:54,043
And VR, I think, is fundamentally different

1010
00:50:54,043 --> 00:50:58,306
because it strives to be ultimately indistinguishable

1011
00:50:58,306 --> 00:50:59,406
from reality.

1012
00:50:59,406 --> 00:51:01,548
It strives to replace sensory input of reality

1013
00:51:01,548 --> 00:51:02,568
itself with something synthetic.

1014
00:51:02,568 --> 00:51:04,610
And in that case, something violent

1015
00:51:04,610 --> 00:51:06,591
is you carrying out a violent action.

1016
00:51:06,591 --> 00:51:09,173
It is not through a proxy or through make-believe.

1017
00:51:09,173 --> 00:51:11,534
There is no, ultimately, in its ideal form,

1018
00:51:11,534 --> 00:51:15,317
no awareness that it isn't real other than the memory

1019
00:51:15,317 --> 00:51:15,977
of going into VR.

1020
00:51:16,387 --> 00:51:31,950
So the CNN editorial that I actually wrote addresses this succinctly because there was a Stanford faculty member researcher who had the same opinion and raised the fact, he actually made design suggestions, like if we curve the bullets, then at least we're not training.

1021
00:51:31,950 --> 00:51:32,670
All right, that'll be good.

1022
00:51:32,670 --> 00:51:33,670
Yeah.

1023
00:51:33,670 --> 00:51:36,051
So I have a full response to that.

1024
00:51:36,051 --> 00:51:44,032
And I don't think that increased realism drives us to be the kinds of people who would do heinous acts.

1025
00:51:44,944 --> 00:51:48,546
But the question wasn't increased realism necessarily,

1026
00:51:48,546 --> 00:51:51,447
but the distinctional difference between something

1027
00:51:51,447 --> 00:51:53,588
that happens in a rectangle and something

1028
00:51:53,588 --> 00:51:57,771
that you have a first direct experience of with your senses,

1029
00:51:57,771 --> 00:51:59,351
the way reality interacts with your senses.

1030
00:51:59,852 --> 00:52:04,475
I guess I would argue though that it's not just about senses.

1031
00:52:04,475 --> 00:52:09,379
Human beings are more than just a response to particular stimuli.

1032
00:52:09,379 --> 00:52:11,840
There's a contextual awareness about what you're doing.

1033
00:52:11,840 --> 00:52:15,363
So unless it's the Matrix where you don't know you're in the Matrix and you're being

1034
00:52:15,363 --> 00:52:19,386
powered by batteries in the background, like you knew you put a VR headset on, you knew

1035
00:52:19,386 --> 00:52:21,047
that you're engaged with...

1036
00:52:21,367 --> 00:52:26,972
a fantasy environment that is not in present day reality, so on and so forth.

1037
00:52:26,972 --> 00:52:32,396
So the contextual understanding of what you're doing and why you're doing it and the motivation

1038
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:41,203
behind that is still wildly different than the physical act of what would happen in,

1039
00:52:41,203 --> 00:52:45,787
say, like soldier training, where you know that, in fact, you're training for a real

1040
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:46,447
life scenario.

1041
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:50,372
where you are going to be shot at or are going to be shooting.

1042
00:52:50,372 --> 00:52:56,976
So it's again, right, there's, you know, we can, a lot of people will point to the graphics,

1043
00:52:56,976 --> 00:53:03,120
will point to the realism, right, but the behavior, right, is something that we don't really,

1044
00:53:03,120 --> 00:53:05,142
you know, it's much stickier than that.

1045
00:53:05,501 --> 00:53:09,104
I sympathize with what you're saying because we frequently speak out of both sides of our

1046
00:53:09,104 --> 00:53:12,827
mouth on this kind of stuff where we say like for training, for surgery, it's just like

1047
00:53:12,827 --> 00:53:14,149
being a surgeon, right?

1048
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:16,931
Or for what it is to have the refugee experience.

1049
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:20,134
It's just like the simulated empathy machine, right?

1050
00:53:20,134 --> 00:53:20,514
So I get it.

1051
00:53:20,514 --> 00:53:27,660
But at the same time, I think that if you look at play and make-believe

1052
00:53:28,144 --> 00:53:32,006
People have been role-playing all sorts of experiences

1053
00:53:32,006 --> 00:53:34,407
with various levels of realism,

1054
00:53:34,407 --> 00:53:36,388
with and without computer mediation.

1055
00:53:36,388 --> 00:53:39,469
There are live-action role-playing organizations

1056
00:53:39,469 --> 00:53:44,272
that rent ships and all dress in authentic gear,

1057
00:53:44,272 --> 00:53:46,913
but they never stab each other, right?

1058
00:53:46,913 --> 00:53:50,154
Like when they're, and they feel like pirates

1059
00:53:50,154 --> 00:53:53,156
or they look like spaceship Star Troopers

1060
00:53:53,156 --> 00:53:55,037
or whatever the thing that they're doing is,

1061
00:53:55,037 --> 00:53:55,537
but...

1062
00:53:55,977 --> 00:54:02,620
you are you because you play that thing we're good at differentiating that people are good

1063
00:54:02,620 --> 00:54:07,602
at differentiating that and when people can't differentiate reality from fantasy um there there

1064
00:54:07,602 --> 00:54:13,224
is there's actually a disease for that right um and so i don't know that technology is the problem

1065
00:54:13,224 --> 00:54:16,725
with this um uh the separation between those two things we'll happily talk to you out in the

1066
00:54:16,725 --> 00:54:19,066
hallway with a little more if you'd like all right if that's cool thanks

1067
00:54:20,842 --> 00:54:25,826
Hello, I'm I come from parallel industry. I'm working for as

1068
00:54:25,826 --> 00:54:30,390
medical operations. So we are doing board games. And have you

1069
00:54:30,390 --> 00:54:35,234
have you ever like within your research where they were this

1070
00:54:35,234 --> 00:54:39,518
topic of analog games were covered? Can I can I look for

1071
00:54:39,518 --> 00:54:40,479
something interesting?

1072
00:54:40,970 --> 00:54:44,391
Has there been any work on analog games and violence?

1073
00:54:44,391 --> 00:54:46,191
Like, or game violence?

1074
00:54:46,191 --> 00:54:48,252
I mean, D&D, of course, yeah, but then...

1075
00:54:48,252 --> 00:54:49,052
Not that I'm familiar with.

1076
00:54:49,052 --> 00:54:50,172
D&D is a good example, but right.

1077
00:54:50,172 --> 00:54:50,992
Yeah.

1078
00:54:50,992 --> 00:54:52,592
And something other,

1079
00:54:52,592 --> 00:54:54,613
because we are funding this kind of research,

1080
00:54:54,613 --> 00:54:56,973
and if someone is interested, I would like to share.

1081
00:54:56,973 --> 00:54:57,393
I think one of the...

1082
00:54:57,393 --> 00:54:59,874
A challenge that also researchers face is,

1083
00:54:59,874 --> 00:55:02,034
you know, like I have colleagues who say,

1084
00:55:02,034 --> 00:55:04,215
you know, like when you're getting grants,

1085
00:55:04,215 --> 00:55:07,075
like, why don't you approach the game industry for funding?

1086
00:55:07,075 --> 00:55:07,835
And I'm like, ha ha ha.

1087
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:10,136
They're not going to give me money.

1088
00:55:10,136 --> 00:55:13,638
But also the sense that I want to be independent.

1089
00:55:13,638 --> 00:55:17,760
Because if I say, this study was sponsored by EA,

1090
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,281
people are going to give me the eye.

1091
00:55:20,281 --> 00:55:22,542
How independent were you really?

1092
00:55:22,542 --> 00:55:26,644
There are plans for conferences and this stuff.

1093
00:55:26,644 --> 00:55:27,024
Yeah.

1094
00:55:28,253 --> 00:55:37,999
For example, we just launched a document for how games manually are helping people with Alzheimer's disease.

1095
00:55:37,999 --> 00:55:40,540
So this kind of stuff we are looking for.

1096
00:55:40,540 --> 00:55:51,807
I would love to talk to you afterward. There's a whole world of health games researchers that I think would be super interested.

1097
00:55:51,807 --> 00:55:53,448
Thank you.

1098
00:55:54,464 --> 00:55:58,427
Hi. So I've actually had conversations in this vein before,

1099
00:55:58,427 --> 00:56:02,531
where talking about publications and kind of the biases that can go into them

1100
00:56:02,531 --> 00:56:05,993
and the publication stuff. And we, during the conversation,

1101
00:56:05,993 --> 00:56:09,937
the thing was brought up of these positives articles.

1102
00:56:10,057 --> 00:56:13,458
And somebody who was talking for the other side says,

1103
00:56:13,458 --> 00:56:15,859
why can't you say all those same things about those?

1104
00:56:15,859 --> 00:56:18,100
The bias, the fact that it's sensational

1105
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,001
to say these are good.

1106
00:56:19,001 --> 00:56:21,262
And we had an interesting conversation about it.

1107
00:56:21,262 --> 00:56:23,163
I'm curious what you would say would be a good response

1108
00:56:23,163 --> 00:56:25,264
to saying like, if you apply those arguments

1109
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:26,505
back towards the positive articles.

1110
00:56:26,505 --> 00:56:30,406
I need help with the question just a little bit more.

1111
00:56:30,406 --> 00:56:30,747
I'm sorry.

1112
00:56:31,538 --> 00:56:37,341
So basically for like a lot of the sensationalist ones like old books about D&D and stuff like that

1113
00:56:37,341 --> 00:56:40,303
There was a lot of there was kind of the moral panic

1114
00:56:40,303 --> 00:56:45,166
There's some where it's like this is a very punchy headline that was convinced down

1115
00:56:45,166 --> 00:56:52,030
God, so when the same thing is said about like all these being positive like all the good things games do yeah, okay

1116
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:57,273
I got it. I got so because because to be perfectly honest there isn't like on the

1117
00:56:58,385 --> 00:57:01,407
no one's really arguing against those things.

1118
00:57:01,407 --> 00:57:04,449
So as Mia pointed out, where there might be studies

1119
00:57:04,449 --> 00:57:07,131
and we go back and forth over a period of time

1120
00:57:07,131 --> 00:57:09,732
of are games addictive or are games not addictive,

1121
00:57:09,732 --> 00:57:12,054
we're not seeing articles showing

1122
00:57:12,054 --> 00:57:13,354
that games don't reduce anxiety.

1123
00:57:13,354 --> 00:57:17,037
We're not seeing articles that show games

1124
00:57:17,037 --> 00:57:21,039
are not reducing self-esteem or increasing self-esteem.

1125
00:57:21,039 --> 00:57:22,500
Right, and so they're actually,

1126
00:57:22,500 --> 00:57:23,701
there aren't,

1127
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:27,463
other articles to go back to that say these things aren't happening.

1128
00:57:27,463 --> 00:57:31,246
And so it's kind of like there are lots of debates where everyone wants to believe there's two sides

1129
00:57:31,246 --> 00:57:36,929
to the debate, but it's like exercise, right? It's like there are no articles that say that

1130
00:57:36,929 --> 00:57:41,953
cardiovascular activity in a regular healthy person can't be a wonderful part of their life,

1131
00:57:41,953 --> 00:57:45,655
right? There's no anti-cardio, I mean there are some silly things on the internet, right?

1132
00:57:45,655 --> 00:57:52,279
But there's no anti-cardiovascular activity study group at Stanford, right? And the same is true,

1133
00:57:52,279 --> 00:57:53,880
the pro-social aspects of games.

1134
00:57:54,257 --> 00:57:57,158
Can I just jump into and say that I would agree

1135
00:57:57,158 --> 00:57:58,339
that I think that all the research

1136
00:57:58,339 --> 00:58:00,320
should be strictly scrutinized,

1137
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:02,662
because, yeah, it's like if you're gonna critique

1138
00:58:02,662 --> 00:58:06,124
one set of studies, you should be critiquing all sets.

1139
00:58:06,124 --> 00:58:08,545
It's just that, honestly, when you come up with,

1140
00:58:08,545 --> 00:58:11,107
you say a nice thing, most people aren't ready

1141
00:58:11,107 --> 00:58:12,848
to jump on you and be like, prove it!

1142
00:58:12,848 --> 00:58:13,008
Right?

1143
00:58:13,008 --> 00:58:14,829
You know, like, I don't think that's true!

1144
00:58:14,829 --> 00:58:15,910
What's your methodology?

1145
00:58:15,910 --> 00:58:17,491
Is it a population sample?

1146
00:58:17,491 --> 00:58:20,573
So that's definitely true, and I would argue

1147
00:58:21,674 --> 00:58:27,179
In terms of the broader concerns, I mean, yes, games do impact people.

1148
00:58:27,179 --> 00:58:28,741
They can impact us poorly.

1149
00:58:28,741 --> 00:58:31,724
They can impact us in positive ways.

1150
00:58:31,724 --> 00:58:35,768
It's just far more complicated in terms of how they do that, right?

1151
00:58:35,768 --> 00:58:39,391
And I think that's true of the positive impacts as much as well.

1152
00:58:39,852 --> 00:58:47,757
Yeah, and I think, too, there's, you know, like, to me, in some of the work that I do

1153
00:58:47,757 --> 00:58:54,821
and the way that that translates into things like policy proposal and legislative action,

1154
00:58:54,821 --> 00:58:58,724
you know, there's either action or there's not, right?

1155
00:58:58,724 --> 00:58:59,845
And so to err on the side of not.

1156
00:59:00,727 --> 00:59:03,968
you know, increase, of not creating more legislation,

1157
00:59:03,968 --> 00:59:08,390
of not creating new policy, of, you know, letting sort of,

1158
00:59:08,390 --> 00:59:11,291
you know, free market just, you know, kind of go and do it,

1159
00:59:11,291 --> 00:59:13,892
you know, its thing, right?

1160
00:59:13,892 --> 00:59:15,973
I think there's the, you know, so, so.

1161
00:59:16,593 --> 00:59:23,456
to me, right, like what's the harm in having a good think piece, right, that makes everybody

1162
00:59:23,456 --> 00:59:26,598
feel good, right, but maybe it wasn't completely accurate.

1163
00:59:26,598 --> 00:59:31,861
Well, yeah, I mean, we should strive for accuracy, but who got hurt?

1164
00:59:32,529 --> 00:59:37,491
right there, whereas on the other end, right, you do that and then, you know, that biases

1165
00:59:37,491 --> 00:59:41,192
public opinion and that creates a, you know, a call to action and we start, you know, passing

1166
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:45,913
laws about, you know, what we're, you know, going to allow to be seen and not seen, right?

1167
00:59:45,913 --> 00:59:52,075
I think that that's a very slippery slope. And so, you know, I would hold a piece that's

1168
00:59:52,075 --> 00:59:58,137
trying to skew public opinion in that way to a high standard, I hope, right? So.

1169
00:59:58,409 --> 01:00:00,631
On that note, I think we're going to conclude here.

1170
01:00:00,631 --> 01:00:02,373
We'll answer questions in the wrap-up room.

1171
01:00:02,373 --> 01:00:05,775
We strongly encourage you to give us your feedback via the

1172
01:00:05,775 --> 01:00:09,138
forms that you now are able to access through mobile phones.

1173
01:00:09,138 --> 01:00:11,360
And also to take these things if you want them.

1174
01:00:11,360 --> 01:00:13,622
Hey, guy with the good hat, you can have it if you want it.

1175
01:00:13,622 --> 01:00:16,945
You had a great question, and that hat is just amazing.

1176
01:00:16,945 --> 01:00:19,027
You seem like the person that deserves this.

1177
01:00:19,027 --> 01:00:19,487
All right, thank you.
