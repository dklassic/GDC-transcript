00:00:03,264 --> 00:00:10,246
Hi everyone. Today I'll be talking to you about cuteness and why it's important.

2
00:00:10,846 --> 00:00:16,907
So let's start off with myself. My name is Jenny and I also go by Qdork on Twitter.

3
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:21,889
I recently graduated from the NYU Game Center with a BFA in game design

4
00:00:22,189 --> 00:00:25,930
and I've been making games for around three years at this point.

5
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,410
So here are some of the cute games I've made.

6
00:00:30,311 --> 00:00:32,651
Slam City Oracles is a commissioned game

7
00:00:32,691 --> 00:00:35,712
that I worked on with Jane Friedhoff

8
00:00:36,032 --> 00:00:37,752
for No Quarter in 2014.

9
00:00:38,292 --> 00:00:40,033
It's a game where you and a friend

10
00:00:40,193 --> 00:00:42,513
slam around and tear down this colorful world

11
00:00:42,794 --> 00:00:44,854
filled with all these weird and silly objects.

12
00:00:45,234 --> 00:00:47,355
It's inspired by a mix of punk rock,

13
00:00:47,695 --> 00:00:49,395
Riot Grrl, and bouncy physics.

14
00:00:49,555 --> 00:00:51,956
So try to create as much chaos as possible

15
00:00:51,996 --> 00:00:52,736
and have fun with that.

16
00:00:53,696 --> 00:00:58,038
I also helped make this game called Stellar Smooch with AP Thompson who also helped me

17
00:00:58,058 --> 00:01:01,979
a lot with this talk so make sure to go follow them on Twitter at Bad Tenders.

18
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:08,521
Stellar Smooch is a game about kissing and loneliness and it got into the IGF in 2014.

19
00:01:09,362 --> 00:01:13,363
We also made a cool alt control version which we showed at the Wild Rumpus that year as

20
00:01:13,403 --> 00:01:13,683
well.

21
00:01:13,963 --> 00:01:19,325
You and a friend have to simultaneously squeeze this big red yoga ball at the correct time

22
00:01:19,585 --> 00:01:21,646
to get the space probes to collide with each other.

23
00:01:23,245 --> 00:01:25,627
The year after, AP and I teamed up again,

24
00:01:25,747 --> 00:01:27,409
and we went on to create BeGlitched.

25
00:01:28,009 --> 00:01:30,051
BeGlitched is a game about insecurity

26
00:01:30,231 --> 00:01:32,353
in our computers and ourselves.

27
00:01:32,873 --> 00:01:35,135
And though it may look cute and silly,

28
00:01:35,535 --> 00:01:38,117
it's actually much more difficult than it seems.

29
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:39,979
It's currently out on Steam

30
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:42,160
and about to get an iOS release.

31
00:01:42,341 --> 00:01:44,002
So if you're interested in checking it out,

32
00:01:44,122 --> 00:01:45,763
definitely go buy it and give us our money.

33
00:01:48,171 --> 00:01:50,212
So while I was working on BeGlitched,

34
00:01:50,352 --> 00:01:53,093
I also took this prototyping class taught by Bennett Foddy

35
00:01:53,453 --> 00:01:56,615
where I made a game a week based on a specific prompt.

36
00:01:56,995 --> 00:01:58,495
So here are some of the prototypes

37
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,836
that came out of that class.

38
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:02,537
The theme for this one was 10 seconds.

39
00:02:02,837 --> 00:02:04,678
So Morning Makeup Madness is a game

40
00:02:04,738 --> 00:02:07,179
where you have 10 seconds to do your makeup.

41
00:02:07,939 --> 00:02:11,361
It's a personal game and it's drawn from my own experience

42
00:02:11,441 --> 00:02:12,581
of waking up super late

43
00:02:12,661 --> 00:02:14,462
and not having enough time to get ready.

44
00:02:15,518 --> 00:02:18,181
Wobble Yoga is another prototype I made in that class.

45
00:02:18,942 --> 00:02:20,604
The theme for this one was shape shift.

46
00:02:20,724 --> 00:02:22,086
It was actually a Ludum Dare theme.

47
00:02:22,626 --> 00:02:24,509
And I decided to make this QWOP-like game

48
00:02:24,769 --> 00:02:27,552
where you have to contort this noodly-limbed avatar

49
00:02:27,633 --> 00:02:30,336
through this series of really challenging yoga poses.

50
00:02:30,756 --> 00:02:32,038
And this game is also based

51
00:02:32,338 --> 00:02:34,301
off of my own personal experience.

52
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:39,582
So anyway, I'm currently working on a personal game

53
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:41,604
about dieting called Consume Me,

54
00:02:42,244 --> 00:02:45,027
and it's focused on this specific time period in my life

55
00:02:45,407 --> 00:02:47,149
where I just wasn't super happy

56
00:02:47,229 --> 00:02:49,231
with the way I looked and with my body.

57
00:02:50,031 --> 00:02:51,993
Even though the subject matter is quite dark,

58
00:02:52,274 --> 00:02:54,335
I intentionally decided to use this cute

59
00:02:54,375 --> 00:02:55,737
and silly aesthetic for the game,

60
00:02:56,037 --> 00:02:57,859
which I'll go into more detail later.

61
00:02:59,101 --> 00:03:00,961
So I just told you about the games I worked on.

62
00:03:01,021 --> 00:03:03,022
Here are some cute games that I like to play.

63
00:03:03,642 --> 00:03:06,143
So Animal Crossing is a game where you go fishing,

64
00:03:06,303 --> 00:03:08,163
catch bugs, and pay off your loans

65
00:03:08,203 --> 00:03:10,324
in order to acquire more debt from Tom Nook,

66
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:12,364
the cute and adorable raccoon in the game.

67
00:03:13,304 --> 00:03:15,685
Neko Atsume is another cute game on my list.

68
00:03:16,385 --> 00:03:18,986
Leave out food for these cats and they'll give you sardines

69
00:03:19,066 --> 00:03:21,126
which you can use to buy additional food

70
00:03:21,166 --> 00:03:22,546
and toys for them later on.

71
00:03:22,626 --> 00:03:24,627
It's a game with pretty limited interaction,

72
00:03:24,987 --> 00:03:26,187
but I kept playing this one

73
00:03:26,227 --> 00:03:28,608
because I just wanted to collect all the cute cats.

74
00:03:29,668 --> 00:03:31,129
Threes is another one that I really like.

75
00:03:31,430 --> 00:03:33,791
It's this tiny puzzle game about matching numbers.

76
00:03:34,371 --> 00:03:36,993
And the design is really minimal but brilliant.

77
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:39,455
And I think the cute faces on the tiles

78
00:03:39,635 --> 00:03:42,436
are just really charming and kind of add a lot

79
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:44,378
to the look and feel of the entire game.

80
00:03:45,198 --> 00:03:49,879
P.O.Mori is a game where you want to stack as many baby chicks onto this plate of food

81
00:03:50,019 --> 00:03:51,920
and make sure they don't topple over.

82
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:55,021
You just want to try to make the biggest structure possible.

83
00:03:55,401 --> 00:04:00,443
And finally, Survive Mola Mola is this game that you can get on your phone.

84
00:04:00,843 --> 00:04:06,324
You're raising this sunfish and it's your job to make this Mola Mola grow as big as

85
00:04:06,384 --> 00:04:06,824
possible.

86
00:04:07,305 --> 00:04:12,326
But it's actually a game that's kind of dark because you have to kill your Mola Mola in

87
00:04:12,386 --> 00:04:13,686
order to make progress in the game.

88
00:04:14,207 --> 00:04:17,370
So you have to unlock every single death method,

89
00:04:17,470 --> 00:04:20,072
ranging from choking on every single type of food

90
00:04:20,393 --> 00:04:22,755
to dying on every adventure that your mola mola goes on.

91
00:04:23,635 --> 00:04:27,176
Anyway, so those are just some of the cute games I love to play, but the thing is, in

92
00:04:27,216 --> 00:04:30,258
general, we have a tendency to dismiss cuteness.

93
00:04:31,018 --> 00:04:34,080
We associate cuteness with being childish and immature.

94
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,402
But today, I want to present a case for cuteness.

95
00:04:38,742 --> 00:04:45,605
So using my work as primary examples, I will show you how cuteness can attract, disarm,

96
00:04:46,406 --> 00:04:46,986
and engage.

97
00:04:48,006 --> 00:04:50,688
And you're basically making a mistake when you underestimate it.

98
00:04:51,692 --> 00:04:54,853
So my first point is cuteness grabs our attention.

99
00:04:55,773 --> 00:04:58,855
Many of the cute games I showed to you earlier are all

100
00:04:58,915 --> 00:04:59,775
really quite charming.

101
00:04:59,815 --> 00:05:01,996
And there's something about them that makes them feel

102
00:05:02,096 --> 00:05:03,437
really friendly and approachable.

103
00:05:04,057 --> 00:05:07,819
So I want to use Stellar Smooch as my main example to

104
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:09,740
show you how cuteness is attention grabbing.

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:11,240
So the way you play this game is.

106
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:19,090
So you tap the screen to release and make the space probes smooch each other.

107
00:05:19,830 --> 00:05:25,453
And the game is short, it's roughly 24 levels, and there's this lovely poem which AP wrote

108
00:05:25,513 --> 00:05:27,313
that acts as part of the level select.

109
00:05:28,234 --> 00:05:32,135
So before the game looked like this, it looked like this.

110
00:05:32,495 --> 00:05:34,396
Actually it really looked like this.

111
00:05:34,776 --> 00:05:37,757
This is the prototype that AP made in a week with their Pixar art.

112
00:05:38,898 --> 00:05:41,619
But, so anyway, this is the version,

113
00:05:42,239 --> 00:05:44,681
the first iteration of art after I joined the project,

114
00:05:45,021 --> 00:05:48,243
and we kept this visual style in for a really long time.

115
00:05:48,863 --> 00:05:52,025
And even though there was nothing inherently wrong

116
00:05:52,045 --> 00:05:54,927
with the art, I felt like there was something missing

117
00:05:54,987 --> 00:05:55,407
about it.

118
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:57,068
You know, the art didn't look terrible,

119
00:05:57,168 --> 00:06:00,089
but it also didn't feel really special.

120
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:02,371
Maybe boring is the right word to describe it.

121
00:06:04,812 --> 00:06:09,513
And even though I swapped out the pixel art with this new visual style,

122
00:06:10,433 --> 00:06:13,194
it fundamentally didn't change the tone of the game.

123
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,615
So the game still retained this very serious tone.

124
00:06:18,295 --> 00:06:19,495
And I mean, just look at the title.

125
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:21,555
This is the original title of Stealth or Smooch.

126
00:06:21,675 --> 00:06:23,876
Dents in metal are just memories of an embrace,

127
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:25,476
which is like a line from the poem.

128
00:06:25,916 --> 00:06:28,717
And the game just lacked any sort of humor.

129
00:06:29,657 --> 00:06:35,380
So when I was staring, so like I was staring at this particular screen for a really long time

130
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:42,162
and just trying to figure out how to make the art better than it currently was, which is challenging

131
00:06:42,222 --> 00:06:46,744
because you know how do you take something that isn't really all that bad in the first place

132
00:06:46,904 --> 00:06:47,665
and make it better?

133
00:06:49,057 --> 00:06:51,738
And so I just drew faces over the planets.

134
00:06:52,079 --> 00:06:54,340
And I know that sounds kind of like a silly answer,

135
00:06:54,460 --> 00:06:56,721
but once I added faces to them,

136
00:06:56,801 --> 00:06:59,822
there is something that felt right about the decision.

137
00:07:00,463 --> 00:07:02,764
By the way, I think it kind of relates

138
00:07:02,844 --> 00:07:05,045
to these images on the screen.

139
00:07:05,105 --> 00:07:08,126
So I don't know if anyone has heard of the term pareidolia,

140
00:07:08,506 --> 00:07:10,267
but examples of this phenomenon

141
00:07:10,367 --> 00:07:12,348
include perceiving a face within an,

142
00:07:13,329 --> 00:07:14,449
inanimate objects.

143
00:07:14,469 --> 00:07:16,571
So we see ourselves in everything,

144
00:07:16,611 --> 00:07:17,932
and this is just one of the ways

145
00:07:17,992 --> 00:07:19,833
that cuteness can grab our attention.

146
00:07:20,814 --> 00:07:22,174
So with that in mind,

147
00:07:22,194 --> 00:07:24,616
I basically started from scratch all over again.

148
00:07:24,636 --> 00:07:27,778
I began developing a new color palette for the game,

149
00:07:28,158 --> 00:07:30,340
and then I went on to add these little faces

150
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:31,421
to the blobs of color,

151
00:07:31,501 --> 00:07:34,583
which would later become the faces of the planets.

152
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,004
And I just kept iterating on it

153
00:07:37,104 --> 00:07:38,986
and trying out different expressions.

154
00:07:39,326 --> 00:07:41,867
I wanted to give the planets their own personalities.

155
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:44,933
And finally, I ended up with these five planets.

156
00:07:45,795 --> 00:07:47,878
I experimented with adding detail to them,

157
00:07:47,998 --> 00:07:50,242
but decided against that decision in the end

158
00:07:50,302 --> 00:07:52,987
because I felt like embracing a more minimal look

159
00:07:53,107 --> 00:07:54,509
made the game more elegant.

160
00:07:55,582 --> 00:07:57,684
So I took away the excess detail,

161
00:07:57,804 --> 00:07:59,926
limited the color palette to only six colors,

162
00:08:00,066 --> 00:08:01,708
and ended up with these five planets

163
00:08:02,008 --> 00:08:03,530
that are the current ones in the game.

164
00:08:04,431 --> 00:08:06,052
And something I realized in hindsight

165
00:08:06,132 --> 00:08:08,275
is that by adding faces to the planets,

166
00:08:08,415 --> 00:08:10,677
I took these elements that were originally

167
00:08:10,737 --> 00:08:12,399
part of the environment of the game

168
00:08:12,719 --> 00:08:13,940
and made them into characters.

169
00:08:14,701 --> 00:08:17,285
By incorporating emotional states to the planets,

170
00:08:17,385 --> 00:08:19,168
the impact of winning or losing a level

171
00:08:19,328 --> 00:08:20,931
felt much more significant.

172
00:08:21,292 --> 00:08:23,535
And the game actually responded to your actions.

173
00:08:23,856 --> 00:08:26,820
It allowed for more expressive and interesting solutions

174
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,483
to other design problems we had.

175
00:08:29,643 --> 00:08:31,524
For example, this is just one of the problems

176
00:08:31,544 --> 00:08:33,026
that we were challenged with.

177
00:08:34,747 --> 00:08:37,650
Adding faces to the planets helped resolve this one issue

178
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:40,672
where basically in the old version,

179
00:08:40,692 --> 00:08:44,876
this piece of ugly UI text would drop down

180
00:08:44,976 --> 00:08:47,198
from the top of the screen whenever you lost.

181
00:08:47,918 --> 00:08:50,840
and it would give you the option of trying the level again

182
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:52,361
or going back to the main menu.

183
00:08:52,762 --> 00:08:55,664
And I really disliked this because I felt like

184
00:08:55,704 --> 00:08:58,726
it looked incredibly jarring and was like very clunky

185
00:08:59,687 --> 00:09:01,288
as a solution to this problem.

186
00:09:01,809 --> 00:09:06,172
So now when you lose, the planets will start crying

187
00:09:06,332 --> 00:09:07,833
and then like a restart button will fade

188
00:09:07,873 --> 00:09:08,914
into the corner of the screen.

189
00:09:08,934 --> 00:09:10,855
Oops.

190
00:09:11,636 --> 00:09:14,718
However, when you win, the planets, whoops, okay.

191
00:09:17,585 --> 00:09:20,086
Yeah, so when you win, the planets will smooch along

192
00:09:20,146 --> 00:09:23,107
and it's just like very clear to indicate

193
00:09:23,147 --> 00:09:24,708
whether or not you won or lost.

194
00:09:25,308 --> 00:09:27,349
And I just felt like this ultimately

195
00:09:27,409 --> 00:09:30,370
was just like a much more intuitive and elegant solution

196
00:09:30,430 --> 00:09:32,851
because it just reduced all these elements

197
00:09:32,891 --> 00:09:34,612
that previously had been on the screen

198
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:37,853
and really focused on the parts of the game that mattered.

199
00:09:39,643 --> 00:09:42,805
Yeah, so, you know, the game shifted from being something

200
00:09:42,845 --> 00:09:45,726
completely serious and kind of boring and lacking any sort

201
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:48,947
of humor to something cuter and more simple

202
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:50,508
and with like a lot more character.

203
00:09:51,268 --> 00:09:55,050
And I just want to quickly talk about this process

204
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:57,931
from Understanding Comics, which is this book

205
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,152
by Scott McCloud.

206
00:09:59,772 --> 00:09:59,912
It's...

207
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:04,114
Basically, I'd like to say the process that took place here

208
00:10:04,754 --> 00:10:07,616
is a form of amplification through simplification.

209
00:10:08,456 --> 00:10:13,499
And basically what it is, is like here's an illustration.

210
00:10:13,599 --> 00:10:15,019
So, you know, to your left,

211
00:10:15,380 --> 00:10:18,221
you see like a very realistic photograph of a man,

212
00:10:18,501 --> 00:10:20,963
but then like with each depiction,

213
00:10:21,383 --> 00:10:22,563
as you're moving towards the right,

214
00:10:22,703 --> 00:10:25,925
it gets more simple and the image becomes more abstract.

215
00:10:26,726 --> 00:10:28,827
And it's like, interesting to question,

216
00:10:28,847 --> 00:10:32,770
you know, this image of like two dots, a line and a circle,

217
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:34,872
still resembles a face.

218
00:10:35,212 --> 00:10:38,795
And it's just like, as acceptable to us

219
00:10:39,515 --> 00:10:43,458
as the image of like the very realistically drawn man.

220
00:10:44,519 --> 00:10:49,962
So, when we abstract an image through this process of cartooning, you know, we're illuminating

221
00:10:50,002 --> 00:10:53,724
a lot of details and we're just focusing on the ones that really do matter.

222
00:10:54,705 --> 00:10:59,848
It's like basically taking the meaning that we want to get across and amplifying it.

223
00:11:01,501 --> 00:11:04,382
So in Cellar Smooch, by adding these faces to the planets

224
00:11:04,442 --> 00:11:06,682
and making them cuter, it just allowed me to focus

225
00:11:07,022 --> 00:11:09,303
my attention to the most important parts of the game.

226
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,384
And as a result, it gave me the opportunity

227
00:11:12,424 --> 00:11:14,984
to just remove a lot of this unnecessary detail

228
00:11:15,084 --> 00:11:16,545
left over from the previous art style.

229
00:11:17,065 --> 00:11:19,265
So don't underestimate the importance

230
00:11:19,325 --> 00:11:21,966
of adding a face to something and making it cuter.

231
00:11:23,225 --> 00:11:27,066
So, however, the thing is, cuteness isn't always about

232
00:11:27,366 --> 00:11:29,027
being friendly and approachable.

233
00:11:29,627 --> 00:11:33,088
It can also act as a mask to hide darker motives.

234
00:11:33,588 --> 00:11:36,308
So in Animal Crossing, one of the first things you do

235
00:11:36,508 --> 00:11:38,369
is take a loan out from Tom Nook

236
00:11:38,449 --> 00:11:40,389
because you need to have a house in the game.

237
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,450
And you need the loan to pay for it.

238
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:45,851
So the game starts off by putting you into debt

239
00:11:45,911 --> 00:11:46,751
to this cute little guy.

240
00:11:48,022 --> 00:11:50,404
But the thing is, even after you pay off this loan,

241
00:11:50,524 --> 00:11:51,864
Tom Nook will always continue

242
00:11:51,884 --> 00:11:53,105
to take your money away from you,

243
00:11:53,405 --> 00:11:55,326
and he will always continue to put you into debt

244
00:11:55,386 --> 00:11:56,827
and acquire more and more property.

245
00:11:57,147 --> 00:12:00,429
He's kind of a little sinister in that sort of way,

246
00:12:00,469 --> 00:12:03,251
like underneath this cute, cuddly face lurks

247
00:12:03,451 --> 00:12:05,572
this more darker intent.

248
00:12:06,272 --> 00:12:08,694
And another example, maybe like a more clear example,

249
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:12,575
is of cuteness acting as a mask for something

250
00:12:12,716 --> 00:12:15,177
far more sinister is Flowey from Undertale.

251
00:12:15,537 --> 00:12:17,658
You know, he's one of the first major characters

252
00:12:17,718 --> 00:12:18,999
that you meet in the game,

253
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,561
and he appears to be super friendly and cute and charming.

254
00:12:23,241 --> 00:12:24,562
However, it's quickly revealed

255
00:12:24,622 --> 00:12:26,663
that Flowey is actually incredibly evil.

256
00:12:27,523 --> 00:12:30,685
He provides an introduction to the mechanics of encounters

257
00:12:30,725 --> 00:12:32,446
by sharing these friendliness pellets,

258
00:12:32,506 --> 00:12:34,387
which are actually harmful bullets.

259
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:41,548
So, you know, Flowey's just another character that operates under this facade of friendliness.

260
00:12:41,668 --> 00:12:46,514
Whenever he drops the skies of cuteness, he often calls the protagonist an idiot.

261
00:12:47,850 --> 00:12:50,332
Which brings me to the main example at this point.

262
00:12:51,072 --> 00:12:54,574
In BeGlitched, cuteness acts as a mask

263
00:12:55,034 --> 00:12:57,735
and disarms people's initial expectations of the game,

264
00:12:58,096 --> 00:13:00,437
specifically in terms of the game's mechanics.

265
00:13:01,077 --> 00:13:03,298
Many people take one look at the game

266
00:13:03,819 --> 00:13:05,659
and underestimate the difficulty of it.

267
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,101
They think it might be easy PC to play it.

268
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,902
Little do they know, it's actually a lot more harder

269
00:13:10,982 --> 00:13:13,203
than its pastel exterior might suggest.

270
00:13:14,996 --> 00:13:18,995
The cute aesthetic also masks the insecurity that the enemy hackers each possess.

271
00:13:20,273 --> 00:13:23,574
So each of these enemies have their own insecurities

272
00:13:23,654 --> 00:13:25,755
which cause them to lash out at the glitch witch.

273
00:13:26,015 --> 00:13:28,375
So examples of this include the squid being worried

274
00:13:28,415 --> 00:13:31,816
about his skills becoming irrelevant and becoming washed up.

275
00:13:32,736 --> 00:13:36,897
The ape feeling frustrated at his inability to copy

276
00:13:37,037 --> 00:13:39,237
or ape the techniques of the glitch witch.

277
00:13:39,977 --> 00:13:42,218
And the bear trying to compensate for his lack

278
00:13:42,258 --> 00:13:44,018
of hacking skills by purchasing

279
00:13:44,078 --> 00:13:45,658
the most powerful technology.

280
00:13:46,896 --> 00:13:50,997
However, cuteness does not necessarily have to hide dark and evil motives.

281
00:13:51,417 --> 00:13:54,678
It isn't always just about masking insecurity.

282
00:13:55,298 --> 00:13:56,998
Cuteness can be a form of rise

283
00:13:57,038 --> 00:13:59,499
and rebellion by subverting people's expectations.

284
00:13:59,939 --> 00:14:01,879
So the rise of cuteness in Japan emerged

285
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,720
in the 1970s as part of this new writing style.

286
00:14:05,200 --> 00:14:08,761
Many teenage girls began to write laterally with mechanical pencils.

287
00:14:09,081 --> 00:14:10,661
And these girls would write in big,

288
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:13,762
rounded characters and add these little pictures to their writings,

289
00:14:13,802 --> 00:14:16,183
such as hearts, stars, emoticon faces.

290
00:14:17,003 --> 00:14:21,884
These pictures would be randomly inserted and make it really difficult to read. So in many of

291
00:14:21,924 --> 00:14:27,365
these cases, their teachers could no longer read their students' handwriting and the handwriting

292
00:14:27,385 --> 00:14:34,927
style was banned in many schools. However, during the 1980s, this new cute writing style was adopted

293
00:14:34,967 --> 00:14:40,528
by magazines and comics and even put onto packaging and advertising. This form of cute

294
00:14:40,568 --> 00:14:45,849
handwriting, which once was banned in schools, has kind of led to this rise of cuteness in Japanese

295
00:14:45,909 --> 00:14:46,230
culture.

296
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,391
And speaking of cuteness in Japanese culture,

297
00:14:49,592 --> 00:14:52,433
is anyone familiar with the latest Sanrio character?

298
00:14:54,835 --> 00:14:56,356
So her name is Aggretsuko,

299
00:14:56,436 --> 00:14:58,938
and she's a 25 year old red panda

300
00:14:58,998 --> 00:15:02,220
working as an office associate in the accounting department

301
00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:04,321
of a highly respected trading company.

302
00:15:04,902 --> 00:15:07,303
However, she's constantly taken advantage of

303
00:15:07,644 --> 00:15:09,985
and bothered by her boss and coworkers.

304
00:15:10,225 --> 00:15:12,287
She has to deal with getting much of the grunt work

305
00:15:12,327 --> 00:15:13,087
shoveled onto her.

306
00:15:14,377 --> 00:15:17,444
And there's this darker side to this seemingly cute character.

307
00:15:17,805 --> 00:15:23,136
So when Aggretsuko gets fed up of everything, she goes and screams death metal karaoke after work.

308
00:15:25,331 --> 00:15:27,632
So that was kind of my final example

309
00:15:27,712 --> 00:15:29,432
for cuteness acting as a mask

310
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:31,493
for something much more darker and more sinister.

311
00:15:31,833 --> 00:15:32,814
Aggretsuko lets us,

312
00:15:33,254 --> 00:15:35,795
or has added dimension to her personality.

313
00:15:36,135 --> 00:15:38,696
You know, she's not only cute, but she's also tough.

314
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:42,797
And it definitely lets us see how cuteness is flexible

315
00:15:42,897 --> 00:15:45,358
because it lets us look at how we can use

316
00:15:45,398 --> 00:15:47,999
this initial appearance of friendliness and charm

317
00:15:48,419 --> 00:15:50,299
to take people's expectations

318
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,720
and subvert them in regards

319
00:15:52,780 --> 00:15:54,421
to what's lying beneath the surface.

320
00:15:54,941 --> 00:16:00,970
Even with BeGlitched, it's a game that's telling you not to underestimate it based off its looks, and I think that's pretty cool.

321
00:16:02,492 --> 00:16:06,538
So my third point is, cuteness gives us room to experiment.

322
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,543
So BeGlitched didn't always look this way.

323
00:16:10,809 --> 00:16:12,651
Even though it's a game about hacking,

324
00:16:12,891 --> 00:16:15,353
it doesn't really share the same aesthetic

325
00:16:15,513 --> 00:16:18,035
as most games that are traditionally cyberpunk.

326
00:16:18,616 --> 00:16:19,737
When you think of cyberpunk,

327
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:22,139
maybe the first thing that pops into your mind

328
00:16:22,159 --> 00:16:27,043
are green, dark dystopias and ultra evil villains.

329
00:16:28,592 --> 00:16:31,275
which is what the original art of the game looked like.

330
00:16:31,696 --> 00:16:34,359
Yeah, so here's the original prototype that AP made.

331
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:37,122
It was dark, green, and kind of serious.

332
00:16:37,703 --> 00:16:40,486
And that tone also reflected in the gameplay as well.

333
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:44,541
When I joined the project, I kept this secret Tumblr,

334
00:16:44,641 --> 00:16:46,583
which I would use to later help develop

335
00:16:46,603 --> 00:16:47,964
my aesthetic for BeGlitched.

336
00:16:48,384 --> 00:16:52,648
I'd reblog images that I found attractive and cute,

337
00:16:52,948 --> 00:16:55,530
and it kind of embodied a certain sort of mood

338
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,691
that I was going for.

339
00:16:57,071 --> 00:16:58,953
And at the same time, I was also really drawn

340
00:16:58,993 --> 00:17:01,895
to these pastel color palettes and this girly pink look.

341
00:17:06,612 --> 00:17:09,893
I also found these super cute versions of old computer UI.

342
00:17:10,354 --> 00:17:13,976
I loved how people created these really girly and cute interfaces.

343
00:17:14,416 --> 00:17:19,339
Something about the playfulness of this sort of imagery spoke to my inner 10-year-old who

344
00:17:19,619 --> 00:17:21,040
loves Hello Kitty and Tamagotchi.

345
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:26,162
It wasn't just cute, it felt nostalgic in a way to me that green cyberpunk dystopias

346
00:17:26,222 --> 00:17:26,703
did not.

347
00:17:28,073 --> 00:17:31,835
However, this cute aesthetic doesn't really work for actual computer interfaces.

348
00:17:32,095 --> 00:17:33,595
Like think about click-clippy.

349
00:17:34,375 --> 00:17:39,017
It's kind of annoying and intrusive and gets in the way of what you're actually trying

350
00:17:39,057 --> 00:17:39,357
to do.

351
00:17:39,457 --> 00:17:45,079
So I think this cute aesthetic really only works for games because games are their own

352
00:17:45,639 --> 00:17:46,659
aesthetic universes.

353
00:17:46,999 --> 00:17:53,461
Having to compete in a space where everything else is at once is where you really want to

354
00:17:53,521 --> 00:17:55,222
assert this actual visual difference.

355
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,091
So that's how I started iterating on the game.

356
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:02,294
One of the first things I did was swap out all the colors

357
00:18:02,354 --> 00:18:03,735
and develop a new color palette.

358
00:18:03,995 --> 00:18:06,517
By the way, I didn't really know how to do pixel art

359
00:18:06,698 --> 00:18:07,898
before joining the project,

360
00:18:07,939 --> 00:18:10,220
so it didn't look very good at first.

361
00:18:10,981 --> 00:18:12,943
But I continued to iterate more and more,

362
00:18:13,003 --> 00:18:16,265
and I just redid the thing over and over again.

363
00:18:16,605 --> 00:18:19,107
And eventually the assets began to look better,

364
00:18:19,288 --> 00:18:22,610
and the visual style began to be more cohesive

365
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,211
and clear to me.

366
00:18:26,198 --> 00:18:30,322
And yeah, it just like took a lot of trial and effort.

367
00:18:30,362 --> 00:18:32,344
I remember staring at the same colors

368
00:18:32,424 --> 00:18:35,547
and feeling like I was going crazy looking at this.

369
00:18:35,928 --> 00:18:37,810
Some days I wanted to rip my eyeballs out,

370
00:18:38,130 --> 00:18:40,853
but eventually after about a million iterations,

371
00:18:41,013 --> 00:18:44,056
I finally arrived with something that we both liked.

372
00:18:44,776 --> 00:18:46,578
And I'm really proud of the end result.

373
00:18:47,179 --> 00:18:49,982
Sure, I felt like this process took a lot of hard work

374
00:18:50,042 --> 00:18:54,086
and dedication and being critical about my own art,

375
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:56,088
but being able to do something experimental

376
00:18:56,128 --> 00:18:58,611
in the first place and carry it out through completion

377
00:18:58,771 --> 00:19:01,935
is just like this incredibly invaluable experience to me.

378
00:19:03,741 --> 00:19:07,306
And in a way, being able to experiment like this,

379
00:19:07,727 --> 00:19:10,211
not being afraid to make mistakes and try out weird stuff

380
00:19:10,251 --> 00:19:11,833
has bled into my other work as well.

381
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:14,858
So here are just some of the prototypes with my design

382
00:19:15,338 --> 00:19:17,321
that has been really driven visually.

383
00:19:19,016 --> 00:19:21,959
Morning Makeup Madness started out as something I doodled in Photoshop,

384
00:19:22,059 --> 00:19:25,782
and then I found out that incorporating this drawing mechanic

385
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:30,066
that players could do creative stuff with

386
00:19:30,246 --> 00:19:34,570
is a really cool way to let players be expressive with their work.

387
00:19:34,910 --> 00:19:39,494
So after I made all these assets, I just brought them into Unity

388
00:19:39,654 --> 00:19:42,777
and then added some constraints with code,

389
00:19:43,077 --> 00:19:45,820
like a countdown and some colliders that would generate a score.

390
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,744
Wobble Yoga is another visually driven game.

391
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:53,027
So I wanted to learn about hinges that week,

392
00:19:53,347 --> 00:19:54,889
and joints, and unity.

393
00:19:54,969 --> 00:19:57,111
So I kind of made this little floppy toy,

394
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:59,273
and then I added some more constraints,

395
00:19:59,593 --> 00:20:00,654
like very simple ones,

396
00:20:00,714 --> 00:20:02,696
like adding a meter to the bottom of the screen,

397
00:20:03,257 --> 00:20:05,179
and having poses that you needed to match.

398
00:20:09,047 --> 00:20:12,089
Here's a two-player game where one player is the octopus

399
00:20:12,309 --> 00:20:14,350
and the other player is the hand with the fork.

400
00:20:14,950 --> 00:20:17,691
And it later evolved into this prototype,

401
00:20:17,951 --> 00:20:19,712
which is a single-player game.

402
00:20:20,152 --> 00:20:22,433
Basically, the player controls my hand

403
00:20:22,553 --> 00:20:24,334
and depending on the food that you're holding,

404
00:20:24,654 --> 00:20:26,275
my head will react differently to it.

405
00:20:26,635 --> 00:20:32,458
So I'll chase unhealthy foods and avoid healthy foods.

406
00:20:36,621 --> 00:20:38,823
Yeah, so I'm not really the first person to do this.

407
00:20:38,843 --> 00:20:41,405
There are so many games out there that approach design

408
00:20:41,445 --> 00:20:43,607
with visuals first, or at least place an equal,

409
00:20:43,687 --> 00:20:46,069
if not more important, emphasis on the visual aesthetic.

410
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:51,193
So Ho Ho Gum by Ricky Haggett and Richard Hogg is one example.

411
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:52,774
Monument Valley by us too.

412
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:56,037
Wrestling with Emotions by Team Laserbeam.

413
00:21:00,140 --> 00:21:01,421
Nog by Co-op Mode.

414
00:21:02,582 --> 00:21:04,984
And Anything Made by Sock Pub.

415
00:21:07,396 --> 00:21:13,144
So we mentioned how cuteness grabs our attention and how it can act as a mask to disarm our expectations

416
00:21:13,565 --> 00:21:15,508
and how it gives us room to experiment.

417
00:21:15,808 --> 00:21:18,252
Now I want to bring you to my final point.

418
00:21:18,553 --> 00:21:21,397
Cuteness connects us. It's inherently relatable.

419
00:21:23,179 --> 00:21:26,101
I want to quickly talk to you about Sanrio again.

420
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:31,205
So I don't know if anyone else is familiar with this character, but his name is Gudetama

421
00:21:31,485 --> 00:21:36,549
and he's a lazy egg, always with this face of despair and kind of lacking in spunk.

422
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:43,054
And Gudetama is hard to motivate and has this extremely negative and defeatist attitude.

423
00:21:45,845 --> 00:21:47,846
On his official Twitter account, he writes,

424
00:21:48,387 --> 00:21:50,147
I don't really feel like tweeting every day.

425
00:21:50,447 --> 00:21:51,348
It's such a bother.

426
00:21:51,748 --> 00:21:53,989
I'll do it because the higher-ups tell me to do it,

427
00:21:54,349 --> 00:21:56,190
but I know I'm gonna be eaten in the end.

428
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:01,112
But here's the thing, Gudetama is super relatable.

429
00:22:01,633 --> 00:22:04,334
Everyone loves him despite his lazy demeanor

430
00:22:04,474 --> 00:22:06,075
and his negative outlook on life.

431
00:22:06,815 --> 00:22:10,998
I want to quickly bring your attention to a couple of games that share similarities

432
00:22:11,058 --> 00:22:12,159
to Gudetama's appeal.

433
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:17,803
There are more and more creators right now creating weird and personal and really intimate

434
00:22:17,843 --> 00:22:21,106
stuff, but I'm just going to mention two creators that have personally inspired my

435
00:22:21,146 --> 00:22:21,786
work a lot.

436
00:22:22,984 --> 00:22:24,906
So the first one is Nina Freeman,

437
00:22:25,026 --> 00:22:27,168
who is a huge role model for me.

438
00:22:27,308 --> 00:22:30,531
She's maybe the reason why I started making personal games

439
00:22:30,591 --> 00:22:33,293
in the first place, because I saw and played her work,

440
00:22:33,393 --> 00:22:35,415
and it opened my eyes to the possibility

441
00:22:35,435 --> 00:22:40,019
of making really deeply personal and vulnerable stuff.

442
00:22:40,119 --> 00:22:43,983
She recently released Kimmy for Humble Bundle,

443
00:22:44,043 --> 00:22:47,046
and I think the Steam release is gonna come soon,

444
00:22:47,086 --> 00:22:48,707
so definitely check it out when it comes out.

445
00:22:51,237 --> 00:22:53,438
You may also know her other game, Sybil,

446
00:22:53,478 --> 00:22:55,318
which she released like over a year ago.

447
00:22:55,338 --> 00:22:59,140
And Sybil is an autobiographical game

448
00:23:01,001 --> 00:23:02,901
where you play as 19 year old,

449
00:23:04,062 --> 00:23:05,863
you play as a 19 year old girl

450
00:23:07,003 --> 00:23:08,704
who has met this guy online

451
00:23:08,984 --> 00:23:10,544
and falls in love with him basically.

452
00:23:10,644 --> 00:23:14,866
And her relationship with him is revealed

453
00:23:14,926 --> 00:23:17,247
through this MMO that they play together.

454
00:23:17,527 --> 00:23:21,890
And I think this game does a great job of tying in this cute and relatable aesthetic

455
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:26,753
to deliver this super personal narrative and help players situate themselves in Nina's

456
00:23:26,813 --> 00:23:27,373
point of view.

457
00:23:28,954 --> 00:23:33,397
Another one of her games that I think really showcases this point of cute being relatable

458
00:23:33,437 --> 00:23:35,458
and personable is How Do You Do It?

459
00:23:35,999 --> 00:23:39,941
You're this little girl whose mom steps out of the house and you're curious about sex.

460
00:23:40,181 --> 00:23:43,663
So you try to get an idea of what that's like by playing with dolls.

461
00:23:43,703 --> 00:23:46,585
And I think so many of us have done that as children.

462
00:23:47,146 --> 00:23:50,048
And I really like this game because I think it puts,

463
00:23:50,688 --> 00:23:53,470
it celebrates teenage girls and their sexual agency.

464
00:23:54,151 --> 00:23:56,933
And it's finally this game which gives women

465
00:23:57,413 --> 00:23:59,515
a sense of autonomy without having to relate

466
00:23:59,575 --> 00:24:01,696
their self-worth to what a man thinks of them.

467
00:24:02,097 --> 00:24:04,218
I think it does a really great job

468
00:24:04,318 --> 00:24:06,440
using this cute visual aesthetic

469
00:24:06,540 --> 00:24:08,341
and these goofy, playful mechanics

470
00:24:08,802 --> 00:24:10,523
that just help get the point across.

471
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:14,646
And this aesthetic just really resonated with me,

472
00:24:14,826 --> 00:24:16,748
both as a designer and as a player.

473
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,671
Another developer who I really like a lot

474
00:24:20,831 --> 00:24:23,153
is Lea Schoenfelder.

475
00:24:23,173 --> 00:24:26,436
You might have heard this game she made with Peter Liu

476
00:24:26,796 --> 00:24:28,637
for the Kinect called Perfect Woman.

477
00:24:29,638 --> 00:24:32,540
And the main mechanic here is body bending.

478
00:24:32,641 --> 00:24:35,403
So you start as a fetus in your mother's womb,

479
00:24:35,883 --> 00:24:37,584
and you perform in front of a Kinect

480
00:24:37,705 --> 00:24:39,986
to mimic various poses that appear on screen.

481
00:24:40,887 --> 00:24:41,967
to act out this character.

482
00:24:42,507 --> 00:24:45,668
It also uses these super goofy and bright visuals

483
00:24:45,908 --> 00:24:48,469
to poke fun and lighten this more serious subject matter,

484
00:24:48,529 --> 00:24:50,610
allowing us to engage and maybe think about

485
00:24:50,630 --> 00:24:52,910
what it means to be a woman in this society.

486
00:24:54,611 --> 00:24:56,351
Leia also made this game called Oot.

487
00:24:57,674 --> 00:25:02,198
The goal is simple, you have to have sex with as many men

488
00:25:02,538 --> 00:25:03,599
before you get married.

489
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:06,441
And the structure has a lot to say about

490
00:25:06,581 --> 00:25:10,104
the sexual constraints that women find themselves in.

491
00:25:10,484 --> 00:25:12,546
You know, it does such a great job intertwining

492
00:25:12,626 --> 00:25:13,987
gay mechanics and narrative.

493
00:25:14,607 --> 00:25:17,489
And the cuteness comes across here with this sense of humor,

494
00:25:17,550 --> 00:25:20,192
which effectively allows us to deliver

495
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:21,613
these more serious topics.

496
00:25:22,013 --> 00:25:26,057
All these games that I just mentioned are games that use this cute aesthetic to get

497
00:25:26,117 --> 00:25:32,142
across these deeply personal and intimate subjects. Anyway, let's talk about Consume Me.

498
00:25:32,983 --> 00:25:37,087
Like I mentioned before, it's a personal game about my experience with dieting.

499
00:25:38,368 --> 00:25:42,572
It's still currently a work in progress and mostly made up of prototypes that

500
00:25:42,953 --> 00:25:45,955
demonstrate the kinds of mechanics I'd like to incorporate into the game.

501
00:25:47,029 --> 00:25:51,571
In some of these prototypes, the player must fit pieces of food Tetris-style on a plate

502
00:25:51,651 --> 00:25:53,371
to hit a calorie target count.

503
00:25:54,312 --> 00:25:57,773
Or put the avatar through strenuous workout routines.

504
00:25:58,633 --> 00:26:01,714
And show the protagonist's distress as she tries on a crop top.

505
00:26:03,065 --> 00:26:04,906
By making you feel obsessed with calories,

506
00:26:05,266 --> 00:26:07,167
looking at food strangely and mechanically,

507
00:26:07,428 --> 00:26:08,628
and fret over losing weight,

508
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:11,810
Consume Me puts the player into the mind of the dieter.

509
00:26:12,351 --> 00:26:14,832
These prototypes explore a three-way dynamic

510
00:26:14,892 --> 00:26:17,054
between the player, the character in the game,

511
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:19,315
and the fact that the character is based off of me,

512
00:26:19,415 --> 00:26:19,876
the author.

513
00:26:20,516 --> 00:26:22,597
What does it mean to push and prod the character

514
00:26:22,637 --> 00:26:24,218
into certain eating behaviors

515
00:26:24,479 --> 00:26:26,040
when the player doesn't get full control

516
00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:27,801
of the character's thoughts and internal state?

517
00:26:28,937 --> 00:26:30,940
I know the game looks really cute and silly,

518
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:33,683
especially for such a dark subject matter.

519
00:26:33,783 --> 00:26:35,325
However, the game didn't always have

520
00:26:35,345 --> 00:26:36,606
this goofy looking aesthetic.

521
00:26:36,847 --> 00:26:38,709
It actually started out a lot more serious.

522
00:26:39,290 --> 00:26:41,833
Okay, so the next couple of things I'm gonna show here

523
00:26:42,073 --> 00:26:43,455
may be triggering to some people

524
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,417
with body image issues and eating disorders.

525
00:26:45,457 --> 00:26:48,160
So I'd suggest looking away or prepare yourself.

526
00:26:49,970 --> 00:26:53,515
So this is actually, I guess, like the basis for my game.

527
00:26:54,135 --> 00:26:56,659
Back in high school, I was really not happy

528
00:26:56,699 --> 00:26:57,440
with the way I looked.

529
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:58,862
So I decided to go on a diet.

530
00:26:59,282 --> 00:27:01,505
I found myself obsessively fixating

531
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,268
on calorie counts and exercising.

532
00:27:03,348 --> 00:27:05,070
So here are pages from my notebook

533
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:06,632
where I did these things.

534
00:27:07,831 --> 00:27:10,031
Little by little, I began to see progress,

535
00:27:10,091 --> 00:27:11,752
but it wasn't enough for me

536
00:27:12,012 --> 00:27:15,233
because I was doing these incredibly unhealthy habits,

537
00:27:15,253 --> 00:27:16,193
you know, these behaviors

538
00:27:16,273 --> 00:27:18,874
that eventually slowed down my weight loss.

539
00:27:19,374 --> 00:27:21,214
So I just kept on increasing my efforts

540
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:22,974
to doing something more drastic.

541
00:27:23,595 --> 00:27:26,875
I started like going on these really weird

542
00:27:26,915 --> 00:27:29,476
and extreme diets, like the 2, 4, 6, 8 diet,

543
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:32,757
where I would end up cycling 200, 400, 600, 800 calories.

544
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,737
And I definitely couldn't keep this up

545
00:27:35,777 --> 00:27:36,898
because it wasn't sustainable.

546
00:27:37,892 --> 00:27:40,133
So in order for me to reach my goal,

547
00:27:40,933 --> 00:27:43,214
or this is how I thought I could reach my goal,

548
00:27:43,454 --> 00:27:45,715
I started developing this set of rules

549
00:27:45,775 --> 00:27:47,536
for myself to strictly follow.

550
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:50,497
I would make myself write everything down that I ate.

551
00:27:50,777 --> 00:27:52,298
I would never allow myself to eat

552
00:27:52,338 --> 00:27:53,858
more than a thousand calories a day.

553
00:27:54,179 --> 00:27:56,219
Some of these rules were really kind of messed up

554
00:27:56,279 --> 00:27:58,781
and ridiculous, like never eat anything

555
00:27:58,861 --> 00:28:00,341
you don't know the calorie count of,

556
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:02,042
or wait at least three hours

557
00:28:02,102 --> 00:28:03,523
before sleeping in your last meal.

558
00:28:04,323 --> 00:28:08,764
I didn't know, but I guess I felt like I could control my destiny with these rules.

559
00:28:09,304 --> 00:28:13,165
I wanted to meet my weight goals so badly that I would do anything, even create, you

560
00:28:13,205 --> 00:28:16,946
know, like these ridiculous constraints up in my head, which, you know, kind of sounds

561
00:28:16,986 --> 00:28:17,506
like a game.

562
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:23,667
And at my worst point, I would end up looking at these like very dark and depressing images

563
00:28:23,707 --> 00:28:26,107
that I would use as motivation to help me lose weight.

564
00:28:26,608 --> 00:28:32,449
And this is actually this aesthetic that I was considering about, considering using for

565
00:28:32,529 --> 00:28:33,009
my game.

566
00:28:34,038 --> 00:28:35,380
So here were some mock-up...

567
00:28:36,100 --> 00:28:40,806
Here were some images I mocked up before I started prototyping, like as concept art.

568
00:28:41,627 --> 00:28:45,952
And yeah, I was really thinking of exploring this darker tone and mood.

569
00:28:46,012 --> 00:28:46,313
However...

570
00:28:47,082 --> 00:28:52,026
I think what prevented me from actually choosing this visual style is that I think there's

571
00:28:52,106 --> 00:28:57,709
a lot more nuance to dieting than just this depressing aspect which took place in my life.

572
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,571
Dieting is awkward and strange.

573
00:29:01,292 --> 00:29:07,255
It's empowering sometimes, horrible sometimes, and we need a conversation with nuance and

574
00:29:07,376 --> 00:29:08,256
honesty about it.

575
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:14,049
So I want to place the powerful feelings of self-consciousness and anxiety front and center

576
00:29:14,149 --> 00:29:16,870
with this discomforting undercurrent of humor.

577
00:29:17,550 --> 00:29:20,551
Is it okay to play or have fun with someone else's pain?

578
00:29:21,051 --> 00:29:24,732
By giving you permission to poke fun at my own suffering, these mechanics attempt to

579
00:29:24,772 --> 00:29:29,053
bring humor and vulnerability to this serious and uncomfortable subject matter.

580
00:29:30,613 --> 00:29:35,814
So yeah, I hope I've, in these past 30 minutes, I've shown you how to make a

581
00:29:37,438 --> 00:29:41,262
I've shown you that you're making a mistake when you undervalue what cuteness can do.

582
00:29:41,923 --> 00:29:43,525
Which brings me to the end of my talk.

583
00:29:43,625 --> 00:29:48,871
And just to quickly sum everything up, you know, cuteness can be sometimes dismissed

584
00:29:48,951 --> 00:29:51,233
as childish and not really taken super seriously.

585
00:29:52,163 --> 00:29:54,065
But, you know, it grabs our attention.

586
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:57,149
It can act as a mask to hide darker motives.

587
00:29:58,411 --> 00:30:01,134
It gives us room to experiment and it connects us

588
00:30:01,194 --> 00:30:03,177
because it's relatable and personable.

589
00:30:04,138 --> 00:30:05,920
Which leads me to say that

590
00:30:06,301 --> 00:30:08,504
cuteness is actually pretty valuable.

591
00:30:09,044 --> 00:30:12,346
Anyway, I hope I've convinced you that cuteness is, in fact,

592
00:30:12,706 --> 00:30:15,328
incredibly powerful and not something we should overlook

593
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:16,208
or undervalue.

594
00:30:16,549 --> 00:30:18,730
There's a lot of potential to exploring design

595
00:30:18,770 --> 00:30:21,512
which embraces cuteness, whether it be through mechanics

596
00:30:21,612 --> 00:30:23,253
or through the visual style of a game.

597
00:30:23,753 --> 00:30:25,754
Adopting cuteness not only allows

598
00:30:25,854 --> 00:30:27,615
us to be attention-grabbing and disarming,

599
00:30:27,935 --> 00:30:31,237
but also encourages us to empathize, relate, and care.

600
00:30:31,658 --> 00:30:32,018
Thank you.

601
00:30:49,072 --> 00:30:53,794
It's gonna be...

602
00:30:56,575 --> 00:30:58,416
I don't know, should I do questions?

603
00:30:59,336 --> 00:31:00,757
Does anyone have any questions?

604
00:31:07,580 --> 00:31:09,161
I can't, yeah?

605
00:31:09,361 --> 00:31:13,163
Hi, on your big list of your, like your teenage list,

606
00:31:13,963 --> 00:31:16,384
you had one, I think like five from the top that said,

607
00:31:18,752 --> 00:31:21,895
It was like, record everything you eat, stay motivated, and don't tell.

608
00:31:23,317 --> 00:31:24,098
What is not telling?

609
00:31:25,660 --> 00:31:27,822
Wait, sorry, could you repeat that question one more time?

610
00:31:28,563 --> 00:31:33,109
Like one of the lists said, stay motivated and don't tell.

611
00:31:33,669 --> 00:31:33,990
Right.

612
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:34,931
And what does that mean?

613
00:31:35,768 --> 00:31:44,333
Well, because I never actually, you know, lost enough weight to be like qualified as like anorexic,

614
00:31:44,613 --> 00:31:47,655
I never felt like I was qualified as being sick.

615
00:31:48,195 --> 00:31:53,638
And I felt like I was just, it was like a really shameful thing to be obsessed with and care.

616
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,979
So that's why I was like, I don't want to tell anyone about it.

617
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:57,480
That's what my mind told me.

618
00:32:03,826 --> 00:32:08,108
Do you have any examples of games that you think could have done a lot better if they

619
00:32:08,168 --> 00:32:09,909
had a cute aesthetic and missed out?

620
00:32:11,750 --> 00:32:12,011
Um...

621
00:32:14,952 --> 00:32:15,312
Hmm.

622
00:32:19,675 --> 00:32:25,919
I don't want to like say horrible things about other games like non-cute aesthetics, I guess.

623
00:32:30,321 --> 00:32:30,661
I don't know.

624
00:32:30,721 --> 00:32:31,121
I can't...

625
00:32:33,603 --> 00:32:35,705
I don't know, I feel like I can't answer that right now.

626
00:32:35,985 --> 00:32:36,166
Yeah.

627
00:32:41,011 --> 00:32:42,473
You seem to be really natural

628
00:32:42,713 --> 00:32:44,856
at finding and expressing cuteness.

629
00:32:45,196 --> 00:32:46,858
Do you have any suggestions for those of us

630
00:32:46,938 --> 00:32:49,281
who might not be so well-inclined?

631
00:32:51,061 --> 00:32:55,903
I think you should definitely just consume cuteness

632
00:32:55,963 --> 00:32:57,444
and look at it around you.

633
00:32:57,544 --> 00:33:00,646
And I would definitely recommend having a Tumblr

634
00:33:00,706 --> 00:33:02,707
and just reblogging stuff that you like

635
00:33:03,047 --> 00:33:05,108
and keeping a folder on your desktop

636
00:33:05,368 --> 00:33:07,349
that you just add images to.

637
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:09,890
That's what I do a lot to help develop my aesthetic.

638
00:33:10,110 --> 00:33:11,671
And I think that anyone can do that.

639
00:33:12,331 --> 00:33:12,531
Thanks.

640
00:33:12,792 --> 00:33:12,952
Yeah.

641
00:33:15,773 --> 00:33:17,014
Hi, I'm really a fan of your work.

642
00:33:18,534 --> 00:33:19,955
Do you have any advice for people that

643
00:33:21,382 --> 00:33:24,986
are not necessarily represented within the games industry that don't have a lot of access

644
00:33:25,067 --> 00:33:29,291
to like games education for like tools that they could use to tell more about themselves

645
00:33:29,331 --> 00:33:31,554
personal games, like to make personal games?

646
00:33:32,618 --> 00:33:36,561
I would definitely suggest using Twine, first of all,

647
00:33:36,661 --> 00:33:38,143
because I think that's a great tool,

648
00:33:38,283 --> 00:33:39,844
especially if we don't have a lot of

649
00:33:40,464 --> 00:33:41,906
background knowledge in programming.

650
00:33:43,967 --> 00:33:47,430
I think my advice when it comes to this stuff is

651
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:50,853
go to game jams and meet people and collaborate with them,

652
00:33:51,133 --> 00:33:53,915
and also be sure to finish small projects.

653
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:58,198
So don't make something that's really huge and ambitious.

654
00:33:58,238 --> 00:33:59,679
Just start small and like,

655
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:02,562
finish the game and just keep doing that over and over again.

656
00:34:03,002 --> 00:34:08,547
And, you know, uh, be weird about it and don't be afraid to like talk about

657
00:34:08,587 --> 00:34:11,169
vulnerable stuff. Yeah.

658
00:34:14,659 --> 00:34:16,039
Hi, thank you for your presentation.

659
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,460
I was really curious about the relationship

660
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,021
between visual aesthetics and mechanics.

661
00:34:21,601 --> 00:34:23,702
And I wanted to ask if you thought there was such a thing

662
00:34:23,862 --> 00:34:24,922
as a cute mechanic.

663
00:34:25,983 --> 00:34:26,763
A what mechanic?

664
00:34:26,783 --> 00:34:27,883
A cute game mechanic.

665
00:34:28,043 --> 00:34:29,184
A cute game mechanic.

666
00:34:29,984 --> 00:34:33,285
I feel like some of the games that I talked about

667
00:34:33,345 --> 00:34:37,047
like Perfect Woman and How Do You Do It

668
00:34:37,287 --> 00:34:38,947
have these goofy, silly mechanics,

669
00:34:39,007 --> 00:34:40,848
which I personally find cute.

670
00:34:42,189 --> 00:34:43,169
So I would say.

671
00:34:44,129 --> 00:34:48,473
Yeah, like games that I guess emphasize like physics maybe,

672
00:34:50,575 --> 00:34:52,057
like looseness, wobbliness,

673
00:34:52,437 --> 00:34:54,138
I find really cute and charming

674
00:34:54,499 --> 00:34:58,442
and that can be developed using visuals first.

675
00:34:59,123 --> 00:35:00,504
And I think the other aspect of that

676
00:35:00,544 --> 00:35:03,387
is there's a physicality about that sort of like messiness

677
00:35:03,407 --> 00:35:05,328
in those game mechanics, which is interesting as well

678
00:35:05,348 --> 00:35:06,690
because that seems to be common

679
00:35:06,750 --> 00:35:08,471
across the games you were citing.

680
00:35:08,491 --> 00:35:09,432
Great, thank you.

681
00:35:12,069 --> 00:35:14,752
Hi. Thank you for your talk. It was very adorable.

682
00:35:15,233 --> 00:35:15,693
Thank you.

683
00:35:16,694 --> 00:35:20,299
I wanted to ask you, someone said outside that you have like

684
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:24,483
a YouTube channel? Or did I mishear that? Oh, like you do a

685
00:35:24,543 --> 00:35:25,585
show? Is that true?

686
00:35:26,590 --> 00:35:33,294
I really wanted to do YouTube for a long time, so there's probably a channel out there that I uploaded videos to

687
00:35:34,175 --> 00:35:36,236
But I don't really have an official one right now

688
00:35:36,456 --> 00:35:41,459
Yeah, it'd be possible for you to reshare your contact information if you did that did you do that?

689
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,341
I missed the beginning because there's yeah, I can definitely do that really

690
00:35:44,702 --> 00:35:48,985
fast. Okay and then my last thing was would it be okay if I answered somebody

691
00:35:49,045 --> 00:35:52,467
else's question the person who asked about how to emphasize how if they

692
00:35:52,487 --> 00:35:56,590
don't feel inclined on cuteness? Sure. Okay my other suggestion for that would

693
00:35:56,610 --> 00:35:59,612
be find somebody who really likes cuteness. Hi I really like cuteness.

694
00:36:00,112 --> 00:36:04,055
That's a good yeah that's a good suggestion. If you really want more

695
00:36:04,115 --> 00:36:08,338
cuteness in your game find somebody who emphasizes it and ask them for help. So

696
00:36:08,438 --> 00:36:09,839
thank you. Yeah of course.

697
00:36:12,931 --> 00:36:13,652
I really like your talk.

698
00:36:13,792 --> 00:36:15,713
I mean, people keep saying that, so I have to say it now.

699
00:36:17,114 --> 00:36:17,314
Wow.

700
00:36:17,354 --> 00:36:17,935
It's also true.

701
00:36:17,955 --> 00:36:18,795
OK.

702
00:36:21,057 --> 00:36:23,238
Where do you personally, I guess,

703
00:36:23,879 --> 00:36:26,300
cute and charming kind of go hand in hand?

704
00:36:26,340 --> 00:36:28,342
But where do you kind of draw the line between them?

705
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:31,304
Because there are games that are charming, but aren't cute.

706
00:36:31,324 --> 00:36:34,166
And there's games that are cute, but are not charming.

707
00:36:35,046 --> 00:36:38,329
I think the way I'd like to, like,

708
00:36:38,509 --> 00:36:39,689
I'd like to draw the line.

709
00:36:41,405 --> 00:36:45,127
with like cute having this aspect of silliness

710
00:36:45,187 --> 00:36:49,069
and goofiness and doing something kind of like dumb maybe

711
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:50,589
and being able to laugh at that.

712
00:36:51,110 --> 00:36:51,950
So yeah.

713
00:36:52,510 --> 00:36:53,651
So it's kind of like self,

714
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:54,972
like finding the humor in yourself.

715
00:36:55,072 --> 00:36:57,193
Yeah, yeah, I think that definitely ties into it.

716
00:36:57,213 --> 00:36:58,353
Cool, thank you.

717
00:36:58,373 --> 00:36:58,514
Yeah.

718
00:37:05,857 --> 00:37:06,538
I think, oh.

719
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:07,618
Hey.

720
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:11,680
So I kind of interpret what you're saying is

721
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,521
cuteness is something that allows us to address ourselves

722
00:37:15,561 --> 00:37:16,761
without neglecting ourselves.

723
00:37:17,241 --> 00:37:21,063
And I was wondering how you think that this kind of like

724
00:37:21,083 --> 00:37:24,164
personal game making that you seem to be going forward

725
00:37:24,344 --> 00:37:27,585
with some of your recent projects fits into the scope of

726
00:37:28,325 --> 00:37:30,826
what people like in Anthropy saying about like

727
00:37:30,886 --> 00:37:33,407
stepping in people's shoes and the likes of that.

728
00:37:35,365 --> 00:37:38,788
Is your question like, how does my game making,

729
00:37:39,589 --> 00:37:42,831
or the games that I've made fit into this like overall,

730
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:48,737
I guess like, all these games that are being made

731
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:50,778
about personal and intimate subjects like that?

732
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:55,562
Yeah, I mean, I think that like people need to create,

733
00:37:56,283 --> 00:37:58,685
like keep making them, and I know it's a hard thing to do

734
00:37:58,785 --> 00:38:01,428
because they're not like really,

735
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:10,254
marketable or it's like really hard for that to happen and I mean I guess like my personal feeling about that is like

736
00:38:11,075 --> 00:38:17,201
like we just need to keep making more of this and not be afraid to like charge for our work and like

737
00:38:18,283 --> 00:38:21,386
Asked to be paid for this hard work that we do

738
00:38:22,294 --> 00:38:28,522
You know, but I think, like, at the same time, it's like, equally challenging because, like, when you, you know,

739
00:38:29,523 --> 00:38:34,770
charge for a game, then, like, significantly fewer people are going to play it and buy it.

740
00:38:35,230 --> 00:38:38,875
And I guess, like, the way I'm approaching this right now is, like, I...

741
00:38:40,668 --> 00:38:42,429
I don't know, right now I just kind of see myself

742
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:45,190
like making these really short, cute things

743
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:48,111
that draw people's attention and can be played very quickly.

744
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,272
And I think that's like a good way of like

745
00:38:51,612 --> 00:38:53,413
sharing your personal experience

746
00:38:53,473 --> 00:38:56,774
by making it like very like visually focused.

747
00:38:56,814 --> 00:39:00,055
So people like YouTubers and you know, streamers can play it.

748
00:39:01,076 --> 00:39:02,676
But yeah, those are my thoughts on that.

749
00:39:05,086 --> 00:39:06,570
Thanks everyone for all your questions,

750
00:39:06,690 --> 00:39:08,615
but unfortunately we have to move on to the next speaker.

751
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:09,959
So thank you everyone.

752
00:39:09,999 --> 00:39:10,580
Thanks Jenny.

753
00:39:10,821 --> 00:39:11,202
Thank you.
