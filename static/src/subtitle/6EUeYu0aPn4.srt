1
00:00:02,756 --> 00:00:08,980
Okay, so playtesting is in my opinion one of the most important topics in game design.

2
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:10,601
I find it exhilarating.

3
00:00:11,021 --> 00:00:14,603
It's the moment that everything comes together or falls apart.

4
00:00:15,264 --> 00:00:19,286
The moment where your bainies turn out to be monsters or your quick fixes turn out to

5
00:00:19,326 --> 00:00:19,767
be lovers.

6
00:00:20,527 --> 00:00:23,268
However, most indies I talk to see playtest

7
00:00:23,328 --> 00:00:26,789
as a necessary evil, a painfully confronting moment.

8
00:00:27,429 --> 00:00:29,230
And honestly, I don't think the biggest problem here

9
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:31,710
is that it's difficult to receive feedback

10
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:33,531
on something you deeply care about.

11
00:00:33,951 --> 00:00:35,111
No, that's something I think you can

12
00:00:35,372 --> 00:00:36,872
overcome relatively quickly.

13
00:00:37,732 --> 00:00:40,134
I found that the biggest problem is that a lot of indies

14
00:00:40,675 --> 00:00:43,818
use conventional playtesting methods in finding testers,

15
00:00:43,878 --> 00:00:46,660
in setting up playtests, in gathering feedback,

16
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:48,622
in using surveys or using analytics,

17
00:00:49,483 --> 00:00:52,185
and they end up with data that is hard to interpret,

18
00:00:52,565 --> 00:00:54,887
that is confusing or even contradicting itself.

19
00:00:55,728 --> 00:00:56,489
Evil data.

20
00:00:57,049 --> 00:00:58,471
It's dangerous data.

21
00:00:58,991 --> 00:01:00,793
I'll explain how I define it in a bit,

22
00:01:01,173 --> 00:01:02,494
but it's the stuff that makes...

23
00:01:03,599 --> 00:01:05,762
that makes making games only harder

24
00:01:05,882 --> 00:01:08,005
and makes playtesting way less appealing.

25
00:01:08,786 --> 00:01:11,669
So the goal of my talk here today is

26
00:01:13,011 --> 00:01:16,495
to basically go over some of the things I found

27
00:01:16,635 --> 00:01:19,839
over making seven games in many years.

28
00:01:21,601 --> 00:01:23,924
So I've been trying harder and harder to avoid evil data

29
00:01:24,004 --> 00:01:26,667
and I've experimented with playtesting itself a lot.

30
00:01:26,767 --> 00:01:28,969
I've rebelled against a lot of conventional wisdom.

31
00:01:30,451 --> 00:01:31,952
Sometimes that failed tremendously,

32
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,096
but I also found a lot of these playtesting 101 things

33
00:01:35,956 --> 00:01:37,378
just not to be entirely true.

34
00:01:37,919 --> 00:01:39,700
And so the goal of my talk really is to

35
00:01:41,474 --> 00:01:43,736
make you think about how to make your playtests

36
00:01:43,796 --> 00:01:46,098
more valuable and how to make the playtests

37
00:01:46,318 --> 00:01:47,279
easier to organize.

38
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,481
So on the schedule is,

39
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:52,864
I'll be talking about what evil data is,

40
00:01:52,984 --> 00:01:54,425
where it comes from, and how to avoid it,

41
00:01:54,825 --> 00:01:56,827
and how to organize more valuable playtests.

42
00:01:57,508 --> 00:01:59,149
The talk will get more practical towards the end,

43
00:01:59,169 --> 00:02:00,030
so bear with me.

44
00:02:01,160 --> 00:02:04,042
Before I start, I think I need to remind you that QA is not

45
00:02:04,082 --> 00:02:05,543
the same thing as playtesting.

46
00:02:05,623 --> 00:02:09,205
Simply put, I think QA focuses on getting things to work at

47
00:02:09,425 --> 00:02:12,847
all, while playtesting is much more about the quality of the

48
00:02:12,887 --> 00:02:13,487
things that work.

49
00:02:14,228 --> 00:02:15,408
I thought I should mention it.

50
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:20,632
Okay, so my name is Adriaan de Jong, Adrian in simple English.

51
00:02:22,173 --> 00:02:24,613
I'm a game designer, I'm from Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

52
00:02:25,313 --> 00:02:28,274
I am best known for the IGF nominated Fingal,

53
00:02:28,694 --> 00:02:30,274
which is a finger rubbing game,

54
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,474
which I made with the now closed Game Oven.

55
00:02:33,654 --> 00:02:34,935
I talked about that this morning.

56
00:02:36,415 --> 00:02:37,935
And I'm also known for Bounden,

57
00:02:37,975 --> 00:02:39,655
which I also made with Game Oven,

58
00:02:39,775 --> 00:02:42,716
a sort of mobile ballet dancing game

59
00:02:43,176 --> 00:02:45,837
made in collaboration with the Dutch National Ballet.

60
00:02:47,335 --> 00:02:49,078
And I just released Hidden Folks.

61
00:02:49,158 --> 00:02:49,459
Yay.

62
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:52,546
Awesome.

63
00:02:53,147 --> 00:02:53,608
Thanks a lot.

64
00:02:54,616 --> 00:02:56,897
So this was in collaboration with the illustrator

65
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:57,638
Sylvain Tegrouge.

66
00:02:58,338 --> 00:02:59,799
In the game there's a bunch of targets.

67
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:02,401
They are hiding behind things or inside of things.

68
00:03:02,801 --> 00:03:06,183
And the only way to find them is by unfurling tent flaps

69
00:03:06,243 --> 00:03:08,464
or cutting through bushes or slamming doors

70
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:09,685
or poking crocodiles.

71
00:03:10,786 --> 00:03:12,647
I've been thoroughly testing him, folks,

72
00:03:13,107 --> 00:03:15,588
and all the games before that for more than seven years now

73
00:03:16,069 --> 00:03:18,270
and evil data was lurking all along.

74
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:22,933
So to explain to you what evil data is, here's an anecdote.

75
00:03:24,661 --> 00:03:28,265
A long time ago, I playtested HintFolks at some event.

76
00:03:28,345 --> 00:03:29,526
This is maybe two years ago.

77
00:03:30,187 --> 00:03:32,029
And at the third area of this,

78
00:03:32,149 --> 00:03:35,353
there was a hint for a target that was in the garage.

79
00:03:36,564 --> 00:03:38,826
Most people relatively quickly told me

80
00:03:39,367 --> 00:03:41,048
they didn't know how to open the garage door.

81
00:03:41,168 --> 00:03:43,210
They like tapped on the door, but nothing happened,

82
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:45,092
and they couldn't figure out why it wouldn't open.

83
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,674
And most people quickly quit after that.

84
00:03:48,135 --> 00:03:50,897
So the situation was that you need to drag it open, right?

85
00:03:50,937 --> 00:03:53,099
It's like a simple drag, but previously

86
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:54,481
you would only have to tap on things.

87
00:03:56,162 --> 00:03:59,006
The next day, I implemented a solution to this problem

88
00:03:59,146 --> 00:04:01,389
that the play testers suggested to me,

89
00:04:01,750 --> 00:04:04,293
which was a tiny hand that shows you

90
00:04:04,514 --> 00:04:05,936
how to open the garage door.

91
00:04:06,436 --> 00:04:07,538
And this worked really well.

92
00:04:07,938 --> 00:04:09,741
People know they can open the garage door now.

93
00:04:09,801 --> 00:04:11,964
They sort of like act like their hand is a small hand.

94
00:04:13,143 --> 00:04:15,825
But now the game has become really boring.

95
00:04:16,426 --> 00:04:19,489
Any previous feeling of exploration is completely gone

96
00:04:19,569 --> 00:04:22,031
and people feel like the game is treating them like a baby.

97
00:04:22,572 --> 00:04:24,814
And this bothers me for like a month or so

98
00:04:24,894 --> 00:04:27,576
before I realized I made various mistakes

99
00:04:27,776 --> 00:04:29,658
in playtesting and implementing this feature.

100
00:04:30,599 --> 00:04:32,521
I listened to suggestions from people

101
00:04:32,621 --> 00:04:34,623
who didn't understand the problem

102
00:04:35,043 --> 00:04:37,445
or did not understand what I wanted to achieve with the game.

103
00:04:37,999 --> 00:04:40,543
The people at the event weren't really patient enough,

104
00:04:40,763 --> 00:04:43,447
and so they didn't really take the time to explore,

105
00:04:43,848 --> 00:04:46,272
hence they didn't really find out how to open the door.

106
00:04:46,993 --> 00:04:49,897
So, turns out the problem wasn't necessarily

107
00:04:49,938 --> 00:04:51,680
that the game did not tell people what to do.

108
00:04:52,455 --> 00:04:54,837
The problem was that the game was not telling people

109
00:04:54,977 --> 00:04:55,998
what not to do.

110
00:04:56,518 --> 00:04:58,680
I realized that players would almost always tap

111
00:04:58,720 --> 00:04:59,661
on the garage door, right?

112
00:04:59,961 --> 00:05:03,084
But in reaction to that, the game did nothing.

113
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:07,308
And so what I did, after like a month of thinking about this

114
00:05:07,408 --> 00:05:10,030
I got rid of the tiny hand and added that if you tap

115
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:12,512
on an object you're supposed to drag, it wiggles a bit

116
00:05:12,752 --> 00:05:14,514
in the direction of where you're supposed to slide it.

117
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:16,744
And this worked like a charm.

118
00:05:17,164 --> 00:05:19,945
People more easily discovered that you had to slide it open,

119
00:05:20,225 --> 00:05:21,285
but most important of all,

120
00:05:21,885 --> 00:05:23,745
people had a giant smile on their face

121
00:05:23,826 --> 00:05:25,806
and they discovered it by themselves, you know?

122
00:05:26,626 --> 00:05:28,006
And this is just one example

123
00:05:28,146 --> 00:05:31,147
in which the playtesting results I got from, you know,

124
00:05:31,167 --> 00:05:33,027
all the playtesting distracted me

125
00:05:33,127 --> 00:05:34,467
from making my game better.

126
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,488
I was looking for the wrong things

127
00:05:36,568 --> 00:05:37,948
and I listened to the wrong ideas,

128
00:05:38,528 --> 00:05:40,308
and I think this clearly demonstrates

129
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:42,109
that some data is time-consuming

130
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:44,209
and it can make your game worse.

131
00:05:44,949 --> 00:05:46,030
And that's evil data.

132
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:49,492
So evil data is playtesting results that are distracting,

133
00:05:49,512 --> 00:05:51,313
that are unclear, or that are misleading.

134
00:05:52,254 --> 00:05:55,136
And in turn, that may lead to you guessing what to do.

135
00:05:55,516 --> 00:05:56,777
It may lead to a worse game.

136
00:05:56,837 --> 00:06:00,319
It may lead to a less unique game, longer development time,

137
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,381
and many other bad scenarios.

138
00:06:04,102 --> 00:06:05,863
OK, so that's evil data.

139
00:06:07,044 --> 00:06:10,967
Now let's talk about where it comes from and how to avoid

140
00:06:10,987 --> 00:06:13,448
it, because I've been seeing it in many places.

141
00:06:15,864 --> 00:06:17,265
and I've been putting more and more time

142
00:06:17,325 --> 00:06:20,966
into modeling the playtests so I can avoid it entirely.

143
00:06:20,986 --> 00:06:25,167
And I basically distilled this down to eight points,

144
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,128
eight things I'm now actively paying attention to.

145
00:06:29,828 --> 00:06:30,669
Physical location.

146
00:06:31,429 --> 00:06:35,750
I remember John and Brenda Romero at Fingal's IGF booth,

147
00:06:36,531 --> 00:06:40,552
my second GDC, couple years ago, maybe six years ago, jeez.

148
00:06:43,549 --> 00:06:46,970
after my like, it's like finger sex pitch,

149
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:50,151
they reacted all like, oh, I'm not doing this.

150
00:06:50,191 --> 00:06:51,152
This is disgusting.

151
00:06:51,172 --> 00:06:52,452
Who would ever want to do this?

152
00:06:53,613 --> 00:06:55,833
And they were saying it in a playful way, sure.

153
00:06:56,754 --> 00:06:58,254
But they didn't play it then, right?

154
00:07:00,630 --> 00:07:02,651
I could have seen this as like a sort of,

155
00:07:02,891 --> 00:07:04,612
I could have concluded now, oh shit,

156
00:07:04,632 --> 00:07:05,992
maybe I need to work on my pitch.

157
00:07:06,832 --> 00:07:09,873
I should maybe make a different game.

158
00:07:10,654 --> 00:07:13,675
But I bet that if they would actually be at home

159
00:07:14,115 --> 00:07:15,455
sitting together on their couch,

160
00:07:15,775 --> 00:07:17,496
that exact same pitch would have probably

161
00:07:17,536 --> 00:07:18,576
made their fingers make love.

162
00:07:21,637 --> 00:07:23,978
So, the data you gather from playtests

163
00:07:24,298 --> 00:07:26,659
is hugely influenced by the setting,

164
00:07:26,719 --> 00:07:28,479
by the context of the playtest.

165
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:35,312
Likewise, I found that people playing Hinfolks at events tend to skip the bonus targets more

166
00:07:35,412 --> 00:07:39,998
easily and give up discovering the interactions more quickly than when they would play at

167
00:07:40,038 --> 00:07:40,238
home.

168
00:07:41,772 --> 00:07:44,433
Bounden, the mobile dancing game I talked about,

169
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:46,674
suffered terribly from this evil data.

170
00:07:46,754 --> 00:07:48,915
In hindsight, the game was built on the results

171
00:07:49,055 --> 00:07:51,716
of hundreds of playtests that happened at events,

172
00:07:52,116 --> 00:07:53,737
playthroughs that lasted five minutes

173
00:07:53,817 --> 00:07:54,757
as opposed to an hour.

174
00:07:55,137 --> 00:07:57,118
And as a result, we designed the game

175
00:07:57,138 --> 00:07:58,959
around those first five minutes.

176
00:07:59,419 --> 00:08:01,340
And the rest of the game feels more like a repetition.

177
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:03,981
And this graph of Bounden sessions lengths,

178
00:08:04,842 --> 00:08:07,363
is really painful stuff for me as a designer.

179
00:08:07,503 --> 00:08:11,224
Like nobody, 1%, probably like around 1%,

180
00:08:11,324 --> 00:08:14,566
has been playing my game for more than 30 minutes.

181
00:08:14,766 --> 00:08:15,546
That's painful stuff.

182
00:08:16,327 --> 00:08:17,167
So I want to avoid this.

183
00:08:19,228 --> 00:08:21,369
And to avoid this, to avoid this evil data

184
00:08:21,409 --> 00:08:23,290
resulting from the setting of the playtest,

185
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,551
you just have to make sure that you playtest

186
00:08:26,811 --> 00:08:28,172
in a setting that fits your game.

187
00:08:28,352 --> 00:08:29,292
This could be, you know.

188
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:33,911
at someone's home, at a party,

189
00:08:34,011 --> 00:08:35,955
if you're making a local multiplayer game,

190
00:08:36,757 --> 00:08:37,899
wherever it fits your game.

191
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:39,202
Okay, so that's one.

192
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:41,967
Two, people.

193
00:08:43,588 --> 00:08:48,371
It is tempting to playtest mainly with all the other developers at your office.

194
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:53,936
Or, you know, you have this group of testers, the board game night that you're always testing with.

195
00:08:54,876 --> 00:08:59,240
But different people have different understandings of games and different experiences with the vocabulary,

196
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:02,502
with controls, with conventional game ideas, with structures,

197
00:09:03,042 --> 00:09:05,965
different experiences with prototyping, with testing, giving feedback.

198
00:09:07,429 --> 00:09:09,571
So in an early version of Hidden Folks,

199
00:09:09,611 --> 00:09:12,352
we had many of these dialogue boxes,

200
00:09:12,553 --> 00:09:14,354
and they appeared above these folks,

201
00:09:14,374 --> 00:09:15,294
these little characters,

202
00:09:16,275 --> 00:09:18,357
and tapping them would bring up a little joke,

203
00:09:18,517 --> 00:09:19,657
a very meaningless joke,

204
00:09:20,218 --> 00:09:21,979
to give the characters in the game

205
00:09:22,019 --> 00:09:23,000
a little bit more character.

206
00:09:24,043 --> 00:09:26,905
So a lot of people who don't really identify as gamers

207
00:09:26,945 --> 00:09:28,166
thought they were actually really funny

208
00:09:28,486 --> 00:09:29,827
and then just continue playing the game.

209
00:09:30,267 --> 00:09:32,549
But a lot of people who do identify as gamers

210
00:09:32,989 --> 00:09:35,671
really fixated on these meaningless jokes

211
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,933
as if they were like very important information,

212
00:09:38,573 --> 00:09:39,954
which it was definitely not.

213
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:41,936
And it was actually a giant problem.

214
00:09:42,396 --> 00:09:47,479
And these actual things gave very young kids the idea

215
00:09:48,820 --> 00:09:49,801
because they couldn't read,

216
00:09:49,821 --> 00:09:52,323
that they were missing out on a lot of information.

217
00:09:52,524 --> 00:09:54,205
And I actually had parents come to me

218
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:56,207
and complain to me about having to explain

219
00:09:56,247 --> 00:09:58,209
how the jokes would make sense

220
00:09:58,229 --> 00:10:00,050
and that was actually very confusing to their kids.

221
00:10:00,611 --> 00:10:01,511
So it was very different,

222
00:10:01,531 --> 00:10:03,053
that different groups of people

223
00:10:03,153 --> 00:10:06,015
perceived this speech bubble thing completely different.

224
00:10:07,318 --> 00:10:09,139
So generally speaking, I think this may happen

225
00:10:09,199 --> 00:10:11,300
to elements in your game as well.

226
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,241
I can imagine that if you're making a game for young kids,

227
00:10:14,441 --> 00:10:16,742
it's for instance often played by parents first.

228
00:10:16,782 --> 00:10:20,003
So if the parents don't find it like sort of amusing

229
00:10:20,063 --> 00:10:21,123
or they don't understand it,

230
00:10:21,183 --> 00:10:22,664
the kids probably never get to play it.

231
00:10:23,304 --> 00:10:25,985
And I found that people who play a lot of games

232
00:10:26,565 --> 00:10:30,006
are almost always more impatient than non-gamers.

233
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,267
And it makes me wonder what the other differences.

234
00:10:34,428 --> 00:10:38,230
what other difference there might be that influence the way that people perceive and play your game.

235
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:43,893
And so, yeah, because of this, I think it's easy to miss bottlenecks entirely depending on who's testing.

236
00:10:44,773 --> 00:10:48,976
So how to avoid evil data? Well, never restrict your testers to a specific group of people,

237
00:10:49,136 --> 00:10:52,378
even if those people are not part of your so-called target audience.

238
00:10:53,178 --> 00:10:59,181
Everyone, I think, has something to say about the game, and, you know, my mom has given me amazing advice on the game,

239
00:10:59,301 --> 00:11:00,682
and she's not a game designer at all.

240
00:11:01,182 --> 00:11:03,044
So yeah, I mean, think about like co-workers,

241
00:11:03,284 --> 00:11:05,205
other game developers, you're into Game Friends,

242
00:11:05,225 --> 00:11:07,386
you're not into Game Friends, family, young people,

243
00:11:07,447 --> 00:11:09,368
old people, people from different cultural backgrounds,

244
00:11:09,468 --> 00:11:11,829
fans, online community, just like try it

245
00:11:11,870 --> 00:11:13,270
with all these different kinds of people

246
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:14,751
and see how they perceive the game.

247
00:11:15,612 --> 00:11:17,073
And you'll get different kinds of results

248
00:11:17,113 --> 00:11:18,454
and it might actually help you understand

249
00:11:18,514 --> 00:11:20,415
how different people play your game.

250
00:11:21,796 --> 00:11:23,918
Okay, third thing, your introduction.

251
00:11:24,744 --> 00:11:26,505
This might be a bit of a beginner's mistake,

252
00:11:26,605 --> 00:11:29,347
but a lot of indies tend to give a full introduction

253
00:11:29,367 --> 00:11:31,088
of the game before the testers get to play.

254
00:11:31,609 --> 00:11:33,790
The idea, the story, the controls,

255
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,133
I think that is a huge, huge missed opportunity.

256
00:11:37,633 --> 00:11:40,215
When people buy or download your game,

257
00:11:40,255 --> 00:11:41,475
they won't get that introduction,

258
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:43,237
and they might hit numerous bumps

259
00:11:43,817 --> 00:11:46,039
that could potentially ruin the experience of the game.

260
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:48,260
So.

261
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:53,568
The trick in avoiding evil data here is to skew the data as little as possible.

262
00:11:54,069 --> 00:11:57,117
I have learned by far most about

263
00:11:57,890 --> 00:12:00,372
how to introduce the game, the controls, the UI,

264
00:12:00,412 --> 00:12:01,373
and many other elements.

265
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,675
And I even learned a lot about marketing,

266
00:12:04,295 --> 00:12:06,097
but just simply throwing people in

267
00:12:06,217 --> 00:12:07,818
and seeing where they really get stuck,

268
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:10,060
or what they eventually say to me.

269
00:12:10,901 --> 00:12:13,283
You have to sort of allow people to discover

270
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:16,286
how everything works and how the game makes sense.

271
00:12:16,686 --> 00:12:18,908
And do not mistake the time that they need

272
00:12:18,928 --> 00:12:20,830
to discover everything as a problem.

273
00:12:21,774 --> 00:12:24,998
So don't tell people what to do, do not explain the story,

274
00:12:25,139 --> 00:12:27,722
don't explain what's missing, don't explain the controls,

275
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,525
don't explain the interface, just don't explain anything.

276
00:12:31,186 --> 00:12:35,331
You'll see where the tester will actually hit any bumps.

277
00:12:36,433 --> 00:12:37,895
There's maybe one thing I would mention.

278
00:12:38,805 --> 00:12:40,287
And that is that the game is not done yet,

279
00:12:40,447 --> 00:12:42,669
because this gives testers a mental slack

280
00:12:42,709 --> 00:12:44,350
for when they, you know, when they're staring,

281
00:12:44,571 --> 00:12:47,613
when they know you're staring at their actions,

282
00:12:48,074 --> 00:12:50,996
like, while they can't figure out something.

283
00:12:51,217 --> 00:12:53,779
And it sort of incentivizes them to speak their mind

284
00:12:53,839 --> 00:12:55,480
and be, you know, be honest about,

285
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,083
don't feel so awkward at not getting it.

286
00:12:59,384 --> 00:13:02,527
Okay, number four, surface problems.

287
00:13:04,047 --> 00:13:07,190
For maybe a whole year, I pretty much ignored

288
00:13:07,210 --> 00:13:09,632
the difficult design problem that the difficulty

289
00:13:09,652 --> 00:13:13,535
of the targets varied very much, actually per player.

290
00:13:13,915 --> 00:13:16,017
And that some players would get stuck

291
00:13:16,077 --> 00:13:17,798
on finding a required target

292
00:13:17,898 --> 00:13:19,219
and quit the game prematurely.

293
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,382
I noticed this pretty quickly after introducing

294
00:13:22,442 --> 00:13:25,485
the required and bonus targets paradigm,

295
00:13:26,045 --> 00:13:28,528
but as I didn't know how to solve it immediately,

296
00:13:28,968 --> 00:13:31,350
I slowly started to become blind to it

297
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,591
over the months following.

298
00:13:33,412 --> 00:13:37,176
And so I call these sorts of problems surface problems.

299
00:13:37,616 --> 00:13:40,419
They are like really obvious, right there on the surface,

300
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,881
but you neglect them over time.

301
00:13:43,201 --> 00:13:44,883
And another example would be that

302
00:13:46,002 --> 00:13:48,724
You can focus so much on the details of a character jump

303
00:13:48,964 --> 00:13:50,926
in your four-player local multiplayer game

304
00:13:50,966 --> 00:13:54,309
that you may forget that not even 1% of the people

305
00:13:54,389 --> 00:13:55,850
who would probably like to play your game

306
00:13:56,211 --> 00:13:57,772
even have four controllers.

307
00:13:58,373 --> 00:14:00,695
Now that's a problem you should seriously be thinking about.

308
00:14:01,395 --> 00:14:03,017
And it's very easy to sort of like

309
00:14:03,177 --> 00:14:04,338
forget about these problems.

310
00:14:04,999 --> 00:14:07,080
And there's actually design things you can do about this.

311
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:11,404
So how to avoid evil data coming from these surface problems?

312
00:14:11,424 --> 00:14:14,166
Well, keep looking at the player's experience as a whole.

313
00:14:14,566 --> 00:14:18,309
Don't always test with a specific goal or a hypothesis

314
00:14:18,409 --> 00:14:22,171
or subdivide your playtest into groups like concept testing

315
00:14:22,211 --> 00:14:25,614
or UI testing or usability testing or level design testing.

316
00:14:26,254 --> 00:14:30,097
Playtest so often that you get a lot of data

317
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:31,979
on the whole thing and it becomes harder

318
00:14:32,019 --> 00:14:34,320
to neglect all these problems.

319
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:36,001
Okay.

320
00:14:37,336 --> 00:14:39,187
This might be a little bit of a controversial one, but...

321
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:43,971
We'll see whether you agree with me on that or not.

322
00:14:44,571 --> 00:14:47,072
Because what happened to me super often in HinFox

323
00:14:47,952 --> 00:14:50,893
were layering issues, making it difficult to see something.

324
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:52,853
Sometimes because a character animation

325
00:14:53,133 --> 00:14:56,114
was randomly assigned and a target would blend

326
00:14:56,174 --> 00:14:57,854
with another bush or something,

327
00:14:58,374 --> 00:14:59,635
making it very difficult to see.

328
00:15:00,215 --> 00:15:02,915
Or I would accidentally make a build of the game

329
00:15:02,975 --> 00:15:05,176
with the setting screen on by default.

330
00:15:05,196 --> 00:15:07,176
So every time you loaded a new area,

331
00:15:07,216 --> 00:15:08,637
the setting screen would be right there.

332
00:15:09,057 --> 00:15:09,897
It's super annoying.

333
00:15:09,957 --> 00:15:10,037
And.

334
00:15:10,737 --> 00:15:12,039
the player would have to close it every time.

335
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:15,883
And these sorts of tiny issues can have a big effect

336
00:15:15,963 --> 00:15:16,964
on the player's experience.

337
00:15:18,205 --> 00:15:20,968
And so it also has a big effect on the data you extrapolate

338
00:15:20,988 --> 00:15:21,648
from the playtest.

339
00:15:21,668 --> 00:15:25,232
People might quit more quickly.

340
00:15:27,014 --> 00:15:27,955
This issue though,

341
00:15:28,275 --> 00:15:30,658
would probably take less than five seconds to fix.

342
00:15:31,358 --> 00:15:31,679
And so.

343
00:15:32,915 --> 00:15:35,317
What I do, and this is really against every advice

344
00:15:35,437 --> 00:15:37,398
I've ever received from other game developers,

345
00:15:37,458 --> 00:15:39,239
is I often make changes to the builds

346
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:40,400
in between playtests.

347
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:45,183
And it's made a lot of my playtests way more useful

348
00:15:45,243 --> 00:15:47,825
because I wasn't afraid to then actually move

349
00:15:47,845 --> 00:15:50,146
the target a little bit or disable the setting screen

350
00:15:50,966 --> 00:15:52,067
right in between builds.

351
00:15:53,688 --> 00:15:56,510
So yeah, that's a thing I do and I can recommend it.

352
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,312
Okay, next.

353
00:15:59,592 --> 00:16:00,632
So what testers say.

354
00:16:01,842 --> 00:16:04,024
Testers start playing and they start talking

355
00:16:04,064 --> 00:16:06,025
the things they like, the things they don't like,

356
00:16:06,385 --> 00:16:08,167
the things they don't understand, et cetera.

357
00:16:08,687 --> 00:16:11,489
But it's your job to filter out all the bull crap

358
00:16:11,509 --> 00:16:12,850
that they're saying and distill it

359
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:14,431
to the root of each problem.

360
00:16:14,811 --> 00:16:16,893
Because people are great at saying what's wrong

361
00:16:17,273 --> 00:16:19,495
while never actually saying what's actually wrong.

362
00:16:20,435 --> 00:16:24,018
I encountered this so often, it's really frustrating.

363
00:16:24,598 --> 00:16:26,920
The first hidden folks UI is a good example.

364
00:16:28,261 --> 00:16:29,342
A lot of people told me,

365
00:16:29,362 --> 00:16:32,345
I don't want the targets to be on the screen all the time.

366
00:16:32,926 --> 00:16:36,089
So what I made is a thing that made this giant interface

367
00:16:36,129 --> 00:16:37,690
in the right disappear.

368
00:16:38,111 --> 00:16:40,213
So you could press a button and it would go away.

369
00:16:42,977 --> 00:16:44,618
But then I made that and nobody used it.

370
00:16:44,638 --> 00:16:47,858
It was like, huh, what's, and also nobody complained

371
00:16:47,898 --> 00:16:49,419
anymore, so it was very strange.

372
00:16:50,339 --> 00:16:52,899
And later on I figured that the problem wasn't necessarily

373
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:54,460
that the targets were in the screen,

374
00:16:54,840 --> 00:16:56,420
but that the panel was simply too big

375
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:00,141
and it was obstructing a giant area of the screen, duh.

376
00:17:00,601 --> 00:17:02,542
But the dozen people that played it

377
00:17:02,862 --> 00:17:06,843
and complained about this didn't actually mention

378
00:17:06,883 --> 00:17:08,643
the panel being in front of everything.

379
00:17:08,683 --> 00:17:11,684
So nobody said it, but everyone was sort of

380
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:12,564
pointing at it.

381
00:17:14,285 --> 00:17:16,166
And so second hand information,

382
00:17:16,206 --> 00:17:17,406
like what people are saying to me,

383
00:17:17,426 --> 00:17:22,109
aka evil data, can be a huge, huge distraction.

384
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:25,650
So what I encounter a lot is that people explain

385
00:17:25,690 --> 00:17:28,192
the solution to a problem they don't fully understand,

386
00:17:28,892 --> 00:17:31,653
or a problem that might not actually be the problem.

387
00:17:32,534 --> 00:17:35,795
Or people give suggestions based on this thing

388
00:17:35,835 --> 00:17:37,276
they saw in another game that must be

389
00:17:37,336 --> 00:17:38,417
way better than what you have.

390
00:17:40,477 --> 00:17:42,538
So yeah, on top of this, like social structures

391
00:17:42,578 --> 00:17:44,260
between you and the tester can make

392
00:17:44,680 --> 00:17:46,121
what people tell you very biased,

393
00:17:46,261 --> 00:17:48,243
even when it's anonymous through a survey or something.

394
00:17:48,703 --> 00:17:52,086
So I think feedback filtering is probably the skill

395
00:17:52,106 --> 00:17:54,889
you'll have to train to do your place as well.

396
00:17:56,090 --> 00:17:57,311
So you take in what people say,

397
00:17:57,571 --> 00:17:59,873
you always consider why, why the hell is he saying this?

398
00:18:01,239 --> 00:18:02,679
Okay, next, surveys.

399
00:18:02,939 --> 00:18:06,300
So surveys are by definition second hand data.

400
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:07,981
Think about ratings.

401
00:18:08,261 --> 00:18:10,941
Ratings have not ever helped me pinpoint problems.

402
00:18:11,321 --> 00:18:13,622
So this one star review is like useless to me.

403
00:18:13,902 --> 00:18:15,822
I cannot make level three better

404
00:18:16,202 --> 00:18:18,003
without simply guessing what's wrong with it.

405
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:20,583
I have to guess, oh it's a shitty level, okay, now what?

406
00:18:22,784 --> 00:18:23,604
Open questions.

407
00:18:23,864 --> 00:18:25,524
People often these open questions

408
00:18:25,624 --> 00:18:27,085
with the solutions to problems

409
00:18:27,165 --> 00:18:29,145
that are difficult to read in between the lines.

410
00:18:30,501 --> 00:18:35,084
Here someone said I didn't like level three because it was too difficult. I would make Johnny you should find

411
00:18:35,144 --> 00:18:39,628
So you'd say oh, maybe John is the problem, but actually it turns out the problem wasn't with John

412
00:18:39,708 --> 00:18:45,152
But the fact that people didn't understand they could drag a car away that would then job make John appear

413
00:18:45,192 --> 00:18:49,214
So I I needed to focus on making it clear that you can drag the car away

414
00:18:49,575 --> 00:18:52,297
nothing in this question ever hinted to that and

415
00:18:52,597 --> 00:18:55,259
Yeah, that's dangerous. I couldn't yeah, that's dangerous stuff

416
00:18:56,535 --> 00:19:02,760
So I also discovered that the way players perceive the game or its features, it changes

417
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:03,920
over the course of the game.

418
00:19:04,421 --> 00:19:09,204
I know this because when I ask people to record videos of their play sessions, and this is

419
00:19:09,244 --> 00:19:13,547
something I'll talk about later, and compared their videos to what they emailed me,

420
00:19:14,107 --> 00:19:20,869
There was a very clear correlation between the emotions and the frustrations that they had at the end of their video and their emails.

421
00:19:22,129 --> 00:19:28,270
I could see the tone of their mail was way more in line with the end of their play session.

422
00:19:29,131 --> 00:19:35,532
So, how do you avoid evil data with surveys and open questions and walls of text and feedback?

423
00:19:35,952 --> 00:19:40,113
Well, my opinion is no surveys and no questionnaires ever. Just don't.

424
00:19:40,593 --> 00:19:43,554
There are other methods to know what people think.

425
00:19:44,514 --> 00:19:48,258
that might be more consuming, but at least they're way more reliable.

426
00:19:51,162 --> 00:19:51,402
Next.

427
00:19:53,104 --> 00:19:57,268
So making video games, you've probably sent over builds of your game

428
00:19:57,308 --> 00:20:00,012
to other developers, to friends, asking for feedback.

429
00:20:00,052 --> 00:20:02,775
Maybe you've done a beta of your game.

430
00:20:03,796 --> 00:20:06,478
The results coming from these playtests can be full of evil data,

431
00:20:07,018 --> 00:20:10,520
easily turning your designs and challenges and player obstacles into guesswork.

432
00:20:11,401 --> 00:20:16,544
I explored a few ways of getting valuable data, valuable feedback from online testers,

433
00:20:17,504 --> 00:20:22,047
but each method has their own challenges when it comes to avoiding evil data.

434
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:26,593
So just asking people is, of course, by far the simplest

435
00:20:26,633 --> 00:20:29,595
thing, but it's also the most evil data-prune way of

436
00:20:29,715 --> 00:20:32,516
gathering feedback for reasons that we've discussed before.

437
00:20:32,556 --> 00:20:34,157
You'll get second-hand experiences.

438
00:20:34,217 --> 00:20:36,018
It's written after the player is done playing.

439
00:20:36,558 --> 00:20:39,039
And it gives the player time to think about the experience

440
00:20:39,059 --> 00:20:41,841
and give you their solutions instead of the problems.

441
00:20:42,281 --> 00:20:45,402
So I actually don't aim to get feedback from testers this way

442
00:20:45,462 --> 00:20:45,803
anymore.

443
00:20:46,403 --> 00:20:48,604
It's just usually too general to act upon.

444
00:20:49,894 --> 00:20:52,475
Using analytics to figure out the things you don't know

445
00:20:52,795 --> 00:20:55,717
paradoxically requires you to define a hypothesis

446
00:20:55,797 --> 00:20:58,618
and set up trackers in a way that the accumulated data

447
00:20:58,698 --> 00:21:00,359
will tell you anything useful.

448
00:21:00,779 --> 00:21:03,220
So how can you prepare for something that you don't know?

449
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:06,842
So in this example, using game analytics,

450
00:21:06,902 --> 00:21:10,023
which I can recommend if you wanna go down this route,

451
00:21:10,643 --> 00:21:14,065
I can see how long it takes on average

452
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:16,886
to find targets in the camping area in Hidden Folks.

453
00:21:18,427 --> 00:21:22,153
The mushroom in a hidden folks takes people much longer to find on average.

454
00:21:22,834 --> 00:21:26,460
And maybe that's not even bad, but this chart doesn't tell me why.

455
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,264
I know it's longer, but it doesn't tell me why.

456
00:21:29,905 --> 00:21:31,287
And that's so I have to guess why.

457
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,010
And I think that's evil data.

458
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:37,324
So another common analytics method is using funnels,

459
00:21:37,944 --> 00:21:40,326
seeing how many players convert from level to level

460
00:21:40,426 --> 00:21:44,730
or menu to menu, or anything that has a sequence to it.

461
00:21:45,551 --> 00:21:47,472
What you're seeing here is the level progression

462
00:21:48,033 --> 00:21:50,215
of Hidden Folks for the players who download the game

463
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:51,035
in the first week.

464
00:21:51,396 --> 00:21:54,979
So only 7% of the people who bought the game

465
00:21:55,039 --> 00:21:56,900
actually reached the end, which I've heard

466
00:21:56,940 --> 00:21:58,702
is actually a really big number.

467
00:22:00,283 --> 00:22:04,128
So in this funnel, also from Google Analytics, loads of people quit at level 3.

468
00:22:04,669 --> 00:22:05,690
You can see a giant drop.

469
00:22:06,471 --> 00:22:07,633
But I have to guess what it is.

470
00:22:08,013 --> 00:22:10,677
And again, like guessing work, very prone to evil data.

471
00:22:11,558 --> 00:22:12,879
I might change the game for worse here.

472
00:22:14,165 --> 00:22:17,166
Okay, heat maps though are way more spatial

473
00:22:17,206 --> 00:22:18,506
than regular analytics data.

474
00:22:18,566 --> 00:22:19,767
So it's a bit more specific

475
00:22:19,827 --> 00:22:21,487
and you can remove some of that guesswork.

476
00:22:22,367 --> 00:22:24,168
What you're seeing here is Unity analytics

477
00:22:24,288 --> 00:22:25,228
running inside the editor.

478
00:22:25,628 --> 00:22:28,469
And I was able to conclude from this image

479
00:22:28,589 --> 00:22:30,990
that people are eager to tap on the back of the truck.

480
00:22:31,750 --> 00:22:33,972
and the motorcycles somewhere like in the middle right.

481
00:22:35,072 --> 00:22:36,733
And those things were actually missing feedback.

482
00:22:37,333 --> 00:22:39,534
And so I added those and now people would have

483
00:22:39,574 --> 00:22:41,835
a much more satisfying experience playing the game

484
00:22:41,855 --> 00:22:43,116
because more things would react to it.

485
00:22:43,456 --> 00:22:45,637
So yeah, I can do a little bit of level design

486
00:22:45,657 --> 00:22:48,099
based on this, it's a little less guesswork.

487
00:22:48,819 --> 00:22:50,580
I can identify some problems,

488
00:22:50,780 --> 00:22:52,461
but it still doesn't come close

489
00:22:52,521 --> 00:22:53,761
to actually seeing people play.

490
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,241
Which brings me to using gameplay recordings.

491
00:22:58,342 --> 00:22:59,882
I am super into this right now.

492
00:23:00,903 --> 00:23:02,984
I'm not talking about YouTubers or Twitchers

493
00:23:03,244 --> 00:23:05,025
who try to entertain their audiences,

494
00:23:05,965 --> 00:23:08,846
but I'm talking about people making videos

495
00:23:09,226 --> 00:23:11,908
of their play sessions dedicated to me.

496
00:23:12,588 --> 00:23:17,109
A lot of the evil data you get from physical playtests is still present in these kinds of playtests,

497
00:23:17,269 --> 00:23:18,709
just to a lesser extent.

498
00:23:19,309 --> 00:23:24,070
This is currently the closest you can get to a first-hand experience of the tester through the internet.

499
00:23:24,150 --> 00:23:26,251
You see what they do, when they do it,

500
00:23:27,371 --> 00:23:29,412
you hear what they say, when they say it,

501
00:23:29,852 --> 00:23:34,153
and they are doing it in their own time, at their own pace, in a relevant context.

502
00:23:35,148 --> 00:23:37,730
So evil data still comes from testers.

503
00:23:37,971 --> 00:23:40,633
They still give suggestions while never describing

504
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:41,714
what the actual problem is.

505
00:23:42,375 --> 00:23:44,097
Fortunately, you can actually see what they're doing,

506
00:23:44,137 --> 00:23:46,739
so you can, you know, it helps you filtering

507
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:49,042
and also see what the actual problem could be.

508
00:23:50,443 --> 00:23:52,185
On top of that, people are still very aware

509
00:23:52,225 --> 00:23:54,348
that you're watching their every move.

510
00:23:54,408 --> 00:23:58,354
So they, actually most of them just talk to me personally

511
00:23:58,394 --> 00:24:00,216
as if, hey, like, oh, Adrian,

512
00:24:00,256 --> 00:24:01,758
look at this thing that I see here.

513
00:24:01,818 --> 00:24:04,842
It's almost as if we're having a conversation sometimes,

514
00:24:05,443 --> 00:24:06,785
even though it's just a video for me.

515
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:10,803
But my biggest problem with this method

516
00:24:10,903 --> 00:24:12,304
is that it's a hassle to set up.

517
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:14,644
So there are people that wouldn't bother doing this,

518
00:24:15,425 --> 00:24:17,765
like my mom, which is a problem if, you know,

519
00:24:18,165 --> 00:24:20,846
the target audience you have in mind isn't that tech savvy.

520
00:24:21,406 --> 00:24:25,367
So this kind of footage is actually super useful to me

521
00:24:25,568 --> 00:24:26,388
in many ways.

522
00:24:26,528 --> 00:24:29,769
Think about timing, level flow, big things and small things.

523
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:32,349
And I think that if you want to avoid evil data,

524
00:24:32,670 --> 00:24:34,890
this is probably the best starting point right now.

525
00:24:35,470 --> 00:24:39,513
But do keep in mind that this will not save you time

526
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:40,994
over physical playtests.

527
00:24:41,414 --> 00:24:42,955
You still have to sit down and watch

528
00:24:43,035 --> 00:24:44,336
hours and hours of footage.

529
00:24:45,596 --> 00:24:45,837
Yeah.

530
00:24:47,017 --> 00:24:49,679
Okay, so those are the eight things that I found

531
00:24:49,739 --> 00:24:54,021
that can help you think about evil data

532
00:24:54,081 --> 00:24:55,242
and how to maybe avoid it.

533
00:24:55,702 --> 00:24:58,464
So how to organize playtests with minimal effort.

534
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,806
Let's talk about how you could do that.

535
00:25:03,283 --> 00:25:05,404
The thing is, if you try hard to playtest

536
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:06,784
throughout the development of the game,

537
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:08,045
instead of when it's almost done,

538
00:25:08,185 --> 00:25:10,646
you'll have a much better grip on the player's experience.

539
00:25:12,407 --> 00:25:13,427
You'll save a lot of time,

540
00:25:13,967 --> 00:25:15,968
because you won't be working on the wrong things,

541
00:25:16,708 --> 00:25:20,010
and you'll be able to work towards version one confidently.

542
00:25:21,893 --> 00:25:23,213
If you play this throughout the project,

543
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:25,134
you will see the nuances of your design.

544
00:25:25,194 --> 00:25:27,254
For instance, we couldn't quite put our finger

545
00:25:27,914 --> 00:25:31,315
on what it was that made some of the hidden folks areas

546
00:25:31,675 --> 00:25:32,495
more fun than others.

547
00:25:32,675 --> 00:25:35,336
And it took us, I think, maybe a year to understand

548
00:25:35,656 --> 00:25:37,556
what the parameters were that made the game fun.

549
00:25:38,077 --> 00:25:39,277
The density of the visuals

550
00:25:39,417 --> 00:25:41,037
versus the density of the interactions.

551
00:25:41,597 --> 00:25:43,958
The 17 different kinds of hints that we found.

552
00:25:44,578 --> 00:25:46,859
The different kinds of interactions that we had.

553
00:25:47,499 --> 00:25:51,420
The visual order or the chaos, et cetera.

554
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:55,322
All nuances that we found because we saw so many people

555
00:25:55,382 --> 00:25:57,623
play the game and thought about it so long.

556
00:25:58,604 --> 00:26:00,905
But you can't just play test every day, right?

557
00:26:01,025 --> 00:26:02,166
There's a lot of overhead.

558
00:26:02,806 --> 00:26:04,507
You need to make a working build,

559
00:26:04,567 --> 00:26:06,068
you need to get people to play.

560
00:26:06,488 --> 00:26:08,849
For physical playtests, you need to be there, take notes.

561
00:26:09,530 --> 00:26:11,431
You have to reflect on your findings and all that

562
00:26:11,471 --> 00:26:13,452
before you can get back to making the game.

563
00:26:14,433 --> 00:26:18,015
So the way I've optimized it is to trigger playtests

564
00:26:18,215 --> 00:26:19,896
at certain moments in my development.

565
00:26:22,102 --> 00:26:24,982
I try to do a playtest when I implement a major feature,

566
00:26:25,182 --> 00:26:27,203
a minor feature, or when there's an event.

567
00:26:27,483 --> 00:26:29,684
If any of these things occur, I would set

568
00:26:29,864 --> 00:26:31,784
an almost automated first step

569
00:26:32,305 --> 00:26:33,905
into the direction of playtesting.

570
00:26:34,145 --> 00:26:37,126
And I would just roll with the playtesting structure

571
00:26:37,306 --> 00:26:40,227
that I had in mind, which I'll explain in a bit.

572
00:26:41,999 --> 00:26:45,282
With Hint Folks, we set out to playtest with every new theme, for instance.

573
00:26:46,163 --> 00:26:49,886
I organized a few offline playtests with non-developer friends and family,

574
00:26:50,607 --> 00:26:53,670
an online playtest with people who signed up to test on our website.

575
00:26:54,270 --> 00:26:57,193
And the way I organized them was really...

576
00:26:57,213 --> 00:27:01,818
I really came up with that to make it as simple as possible for me to start.

577
00:27:02,755 --> 00:27:04,136
My setup came down to three things.

578
00:27:04,697 --> 00:27:07,039
I made a spreadsheet of all the testers,

579
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:09,261
I wrote a bunch of email templates,

580
00:27:09,902 --> 00:27:11,764
and every time I emailed someone,

581
00:27:11,824 --> 00:27:13,906
I would put follow-up dates on my agenda.

582
00:27:14,446 --> 00:27:16,108
So to initiate an offline playtest,

583
00:27:16,288 --> 00:27:20,712
I would maybe text a family member or a friend,

584
00:27:21,273 --> 00:27:23,355
or I would email someone from a list that I keep

585
00:27:23,715 --> 00:27:25,837
with people who have indicated they'd love to try the game.

586
00:27:26,698 --> 00:27:27,979
And it's really that simple.

587
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:30,022
Just send a text, send a single email.

588
00:27:30,322 --> 00:27:32,785
And I would case by case schedule things with these people

589
00:27:32,825 --> 00:27:34,046
and would sit down and play the game.

590
00:27:35,187 --> 00:27:36,849
To initiate an online play test,

591
00:27:36,929 --> 00:27:37,930
I go through a spreadsheet,

592
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:40,733
I'd email somewhere between 30 and 50 people

593
00:27:40,773 --> 00:27:42,495
with a build of the game and instructions

594
00:27:42,575 --> 00:27:44,257
to install or record the gameplay.

595
00:27:45,118 --> 00:27:47,280
And I would immediately set a reminder in my agenda

596
00:27:47,340 --> 00:27:48,201
like a week later.

597
00:27:50,278 --> 00:27:52,581
for if they didn't respond, I would get back to them.

598
00:27:53,002 --> 00:27:55,646
And again, case by case, I would handle questions and emails

599
00:27:55,746 --> 00:27:57,789
all in hope of gameplay videos with voice.

600
00:27:59,455 --> 00:28:04,077
I have all these template emails I can pretty much copy paste, iterate on if needed and

601
00:28:04,437 --> 00:28:05,017
just send out.

602
00:28:05,918 --> 00:28:08,779
It's really simple and it's surprisingly effective.

603
00:28:09,379 --> 00:28:12,781
Everyone I ask for physical playtests, literally everyone, just joins me for a session.

604
00:28:13,301 --> 00:28:16,382
Maybe this is also a social thing but everyone just likes to do this.

605
00:28:17,022 --> 00:28:21,925
And about one third of the people I ask for online playtests, they respond within a week.

606
00:28:22,525 --> 00:28:27,813
and then another one-sixth to a third within two weeks

607
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:29,295
after I send them another email.

608
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:33,761
So, for him folks, this meant that for four months,

609
00:28:34,482 --> 00:28:38,809
especially during the last development of the game.

610
00:28:39,789 --> 00:28:41,870
This meant about 20 to 30 hours

611
00:28:42,330 --> 00:28:44,051
of super useful gameplay footage.

612
00:28:44,471 --> 00:28:46,192
This was like my breakfast every morning.

613
00:28:46,212 --> 00:28:48,513
I would sit down with someone else playing my game.

614
00:28:49,653 --> 00:28:51,074
And these are actually really great numbers

615
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:53,795
for something that I initiate within a couple minutes.

616
00:28:54,655 --> 00:28:56,876
So yeah, it all starts with a simple email,

617
00:28:57,377 --> 00:28:59,998
minimal effort, and I get pretty amazing responses.

618
00:29:00,158 --> 00:29:01,858
So think about doing this.

619
00:29:02,279 --> 00:29:02,919
It's really simple.

620
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:05,940
To inspire you to think about sort of alternative ways,

621
00:29:07,858 --> 00:29:09,839
Here's three other things I've also tried.

622
00:29:09,859 --> 00:29:12,681
I playtested Bounden every other day,

623
00:29:12,822 --> 00:29:14,703
so we made a level on day one,

624
00:29:14,763 --> 00:29:16,124
we playtested it on day two,

625
00:29:16,464 --> 00:29:17,585
made changes on day three,

626
00:29:17,805 --> 00:29:18,726
playtested it on day four.

627
00:29:19,226 --> 00:29:23,390
Very intense to do, super fun, super motivational.

628
00:29:24,831 --> 00:29:26,832
Yeah, it didn't really give us any insight

629
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:27,833
into level flow though.

630
00:29:29,038 --> 00:29:33,483
Fingle is like a party game, you know, and all the finger rubbing is just weird and awkward and social.

631
00:29:33,604 --> 00:29:37,489
So the parties were just really, really the perfect setting for it.

632
00:29:37,609 --> 00:29:39,511
And I was still a student when I was prototyping it,

633
00:29:39,531 --> 00:29:42,495
so I just like take the game to parties every weekend.

634
00:29:42,976 --> 00:29:43,837
That was perfect.

635
00:29:45,747 --> 00:29:47,328
Play Dev Club, it's an event I organize

636
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,648
for game designers in the Netherlands

637
00:29:48,688 --> 00:29:51,148
to come together and playtest each other's games.

638
00:29:51,829 --> 00:29:54,989
As all playtesters, as all attendees are game designers,

639
00:29:55,830 --> 00:29:57,490
you can really talk about your game design

640
00:29:57,510 --> 00:30:00,151
and get feedback in the form of brainstorming together,

641
00:30:00,651 --> 00:30:02,331
really trying to understand the design of the game.

642
00:30:03,091 --> 00:30:04,391
And people will play for longer

643
00:30:05,232 --> 00:30:06,472
than for instance consumer events.

644
00:30:06,912 --> 00:30:08,332
They stick around to give feedback.

645
00:30:08,832 --> 00:30:11,973
But this definitely doesn't replace playtest with consumers.

646
00:30:12,533 --> 00:30:15,174
Designers tend to see problems that aren't problems yet.

647
00:30:16,935 --> 00:30:20,276
So yeah, I hope maybe these three things will inspire you

648
00:30:20,316 --> 00:30:21,477
to figure out something for your game.

649
00:30:21,977 --> 00:30:24,258
So to conclude, how to avoid evil data.

650
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,319
Playtest in the right setting,

651
00:30:27,940 --> 00:30:29,961
make sure the location fits your game.

652
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:34,543
Playtest with everyone so that you don't stare yourself

653
00:30:34,623 --> 00:30:37,244
blind to all these surface problems.

654
00:30:38,184 --> 00:30:40,946
Don't explain anything, just throw people in the game,

655
00:30:41,166 --> 00:30:43,867
see what they, see where they get stuck.

656
00:30:44,816 --> 00:30:46,697
Always playtest the whole experience.

657
00:30:47,897 --> 00:30:49,898
Make those one minute changes if necessary.

658
00:30:49,918 --> 00:30:52,620
It might have a big influence on your playtesting results.

659
00:30:53,260 --> 00:30:54,801
Filter feedback always.

660
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,283
Never just listen to people and do what they say

661
00:30:58,763 --> 00:31:00,924
because they don't always fully understand the problem.

662
00:31:01,904 --> 00:31:03,985
No surveys, no questionnaires ever.

663
00:31:04,205 --> 00:31:07,647
There's better ways of gathering more reliable feedback.

664
00:31:08,701 --> 00:31:14,446
Try getting gameplay and audio recordings because that seems to be a really solid way of gathering feedback.

665
00:31:15,147 --> 00:31:20,972
And you know, make a couple email templates and make initiating a playtest super easy for yourself.

666
00:31:23,454 --> 00:31:24,775
That's it. Thank you.
