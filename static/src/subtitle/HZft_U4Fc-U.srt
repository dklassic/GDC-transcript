1
00:00:06,259 --> 00:00:08,747
Right, I'm John Engold. I'm the narrative director at

2
00:00:09,757 --> 00:00:15,321
Inkle, we're most famous for our game 80 Days, which I'm sure you have at least heard of,

3
00:00:15,401 --> 00:00:20,264
but I'm not actually going to be talking about 80 Days particularly today, so Sid Meier's

4
00:00:20,284 --> 00:00:20,885
still available.

5
00:00:21,485 --> 00:00:25,288
I'm going to be talking about our other big game, which was called Sorcery.

6
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:30,511
Hopefully you've heard of it, hopefully you've played it, so this talk will make some kind

7
00:00:30,551 --> 00:00:31,231
of sense to you.

8
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:37,475
If you haven't, I'll try to be clear, and Rock Paper Shotgun called it their RPG of

9
00:00:37,495 --> 00:00:38,536
the year last year.

10
00:00:38,636 --> 00:00:39,176
So at least...

11
00:00:39,277 --> 00:00:43,319
somebody thinks that it's vaguely worthwhile and worth talking about.

12
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,762
In particular, I'm going to be talking about the last two parts of it, which were sort

13
00:00:49,982 --> 00:00:55,305
of open world games, but only sort of and kinda.

14
00:00:55,405 --> 00:01:00,668
And that sort of and kinda is really what I want to get into, because I think that's

15
00:01:00,708 --> 00:01:01,668
the most interesting bit.

16
00:01:03,994 --> 00:01:09,436
So Sorcery is actually four games adapted from a set of paper game books

17
00:01:09,496 --> 00:01:13,938
written by a UK game designer called Steve Jackson in the early 80s.

18
00:01:13,998 --> 00:01:15,639
Now it's a really interesting series.

19
00:01:15,899 --> 00:01:16,819
I read it when I was a kid.

20
00:01:16,879 --> 00:01:17,600
I read it when I was about 10.

21
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:22,942
And the first one is an absolutely straightforward normal paper game book.

22
00:01:23,022 --> 00:01:24,162
So you read a paragraph.

23
00:01:24,462 --> 00:01:25,403
There are some choices.

24
00:01:25,523 --> 00:01:26,563
You pick one.

25
00:01:26,783 --> 00:01:28,384
It tells you what paragraph of the book to go to.

26
00:01:28,424 --> 00:01:29,784
You go to that paragraph, and so you go.

27
00:01:30,585 --> 00:01:36,069
It had a kind of cunning spell-casting system, but broadly, it was a very straightforward book.

28
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:39,992
But Steve is not that kind of designer.

29
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:43,454
He's the kind of designer who likes to break things and confuse people

30
00:01:44,055 --> 00:01:46,637
and create puzzles and tricks and traps.

31
00:01:46,717 --> 00:01:48,118
And so as the series went on...

32
00:01:48,918 --> 00:01:52,620
the books had more and more weird twists to them.

33
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:56,902
So maybe in one place you had to reverse the numbers on the paragraph

34
00:01:56,942 --> 00:01:58,283
to find a special secret.

35
00:01:58,363 --> 00:02:00,824
Or maybe in another, every time it ended in a seven,

36
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:02,184
there was a rule you could apply.

37
00:02:02,244 --> 00:02:06,686
And so you'd be learning information and breaking the format of the gamebook.

38
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,658
As a kid, reading that, that totally blew my mind.

39
00:02:11,718 --> 00:02:13,520
It was incredible, it was magic.

40
00:02:15,061 --> 00:02:18,464
And our series, which we started about 30 years later,

41
00:02:18,484 --> 00:02:21,627
has also evolved, but in a slightly different way.

42
00:02:24,494 --> 00:02:27,696
So in case you haven't played it, and in case you have,

43
00:02:27,796 --> 00:02:29,857
I'll just sort of take you through that evolution

44
00:02:29,897 --> 00:02:30,557
very quickly.

45
00:02:30,997 --> 00:02:33,638
So sorcery is played out on a map, like a nice fancy map,

46
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:36,220
and you kind of journey across it having adventures.

47
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,282
And part one, which looked like this, was very linear.

48
00:02:42,406 --> 00:02:43,286
but quite branching.

49
00:02:43,346 --> 00:02:46,548
Now, linear is one of those words that's massively overused

50
00:02:46,768 --> 00:02:49,429
and no one ever really knows what it means, so I'll be clear.

51
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:52,291
I don't mean linear as opposed to non-linear.

52
00:02:52,991 --> 00:02:54,172
You didn't get bashed on the head

53
00:02:54,212 --> 00:02:56,333
and have crazy memories coming in weird orders.

54
00:02:56,613 --> 00:02:58,614
I mean linear as opposed to circular.

55
00:02:59,649 --> 00:03:01,931
You always go forward, you don't walk around in circles,

56
00:03:01,951 --> 00:03:03,193
you can never go back on yourself.

57
00:03:03,293 --> 00:03:06,776
That's a defining feature of this particular book.

58
00:03:07,697 --> 00:03:08,798
But as you walk forward,

59
00:03:08,818 --> 00:03:11,081
you're always seeing specific content,

60
00:03:11,161 --> 00:03:12,642
you're always seeing detailed content,

61
00:03:12,762 --> 00:03:14,764
you're meeting people, you're talking to people,

62
00:03:14,844 --> 00:03:15,745
you're having adventures.

63
00:03:16,506 --> 00:03:18,287
having interesting encounters along the way,

64
00:03:18,748 --> 00:03:21,309
but what I do and what you do might be very different

65
00:03:21,389 --> 00:03:22,330
because of that branching.

66
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:24,351
So as you can see, there's a rough sketch

67
00:03:24,612 --> 00:03:26,073
of what our journeys might be like.

68
00:03:26,473 --> 00:03:29,175
We hit some beats, we miss, we share other beats,

69
00:03:29,215 --> 00:03:30,135
we don't share other beats.

70
00:03:31,296 --> 00:03:33,217
But in general, when players played it,

71
00:03:33,898 --> 00:03:35,759
they kind of didn't like it.

72
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,580
They found it was a bit too short.

73
00:03:38,441 --> 00:03:40,002
I guess basically what they said was,

74
00:03:40,262 --> 00:03:43,184
we felt like the missed content was wasted content.

75
00:03:43,424 --> 00:03:44,145
Okay, fair enough.

76
00:03:44,988 --> 00:03:48,189
So for part two, we wanted more people to see more stuff,

77
00:03:48,429 --> 00:03:50,210
while still allowing people to just charge

78
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:51,951
from beginning to end if that's what they wanted.

79
00:03:52,391 --> 00:03:54,292
So we kept that linearity for players

80
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:55,873
who wanted that linear experience,

81
00:03:56,313 --> 00:03:58,054
but because it was set in a city,

82
00:03:58,554 --> 00:04:01,696
we added a little bit of an ability to loop around,

83
00:04:02,396 --> 00:04:04,797
revisit streets, sort of case the city block,

84
00:04:04,877 --> 00:04:07,579
and really farm out all the content in that game.

85
00:04:08,299 --> 00:04:10,140
If you've played it, you'll know there's one other mechanic

86
00:04:10,220 --> 00:04:12,441
to help with that, but that's beyond the scope of this.

87
00:04:13,717 --> 00:04:16,399
But those loops were handcrafted.

88
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:18,522
They were added really late on in development.

89
00:04:18,682 --> 00:04:22,766
We had written most of Sorcery 2 while still coding Sorcery 1.

90
00:04:23,527 --> 00:04:26,970
So the way that we built it was extremely fragile.

91
00:04:27,251 --> 00:04:30,154
You'd be in a street corner, and it would literally say,

92
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:32,076
well, if you haven't been over here, you can go over there.

93
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,837
If you haven't been over here, you can go over there.

94
00:04:33,857 --> 00:04:35,299
If you haven't been over here, you can go over there.

95
00:04:35,799 --> 00:04:41,182
So we had quite a few places where an odd number of paths would collect at a point

96
00:04:41,682 --> 00:04:43,943
and it was possible to loop around and get stuck.

97
00:04:44,623 --> 00:04:46,684
If you know the Bridges of Konigsberg problem.

98
00:04:47,805 --> 00:04:50,366
And I'm pretty sure there's at least one of those still in the shipped game.

99
00:04:51,146 --> 00:04:53,007
But it doesn't matter because it's got a rewind mechanic.

100
00:04:53,087 --> 00:04:54,788
But it's not properly built.

101
00:04:54,908 --> 00:04:57,709
We hadn't actually solved any problems at this point.

102
00:04:58,851 --> 00:05:01,053
So then we went off and we did this 80 days thingy,

103
00:05:01,093 --> 00:05:02,494
and that was fine, and it was great,

104
00:05:02,614 --> 00:05:05,597
and it gave us a bit more freedom to muck around,

105
00:05:05,657 --> 00:05:06,478
which was cool.

106
00:05:06,938 --> 00:05:08,199
So when we came back to Sorcery 3,

107
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:10,201
we wanted to solve that problem properly.

108
00:05:11,002 --> 00:05:13,144
Now, Sorcery 3 is set in a wilderness,

109
00:05:13,584 --> 00:05:15,366
and the story is you're searching

110
00:05:15,426 --> 00:05:16,927
for these serpents all over the map.

111
00:05:17,307 --> 00:05:19,950
So it really doesn't make sense at this point

112
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,091
to disallow backtracking.

113
00:05:22,532 --> 00:05:23,893
If you've got all the way over here,

114
00:05:24,033 --> 00:05:25,775
and you've missed one, and it's there.

115
00:05:26,535 --> 00:05:29,098
than saying, sorry, you can't go and find it.

116
00:05:29,659 --> 00:05:31,561
That's the fighting against every aspect

117
00:05:31,601 --> 00:05:33,504
of what the story is telling you to do.

118
00:05:34,885 --> 00:05:36,808
So we built this one in a completely different way.

119
00:05:37,917 --> 00:05:42,579
From the ground up, we built it to make every single location infinitely revisitable,

120
00:05:43,319 --> 00:05:47,480
and ensure that the player could never get trapped because they'd been in and out so many times

121
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,741
that there was nothing else they could do.

122
00:05:49,501 --> 00:05:52,442
The paths go all over the place, the heat map is essentially irrelevant,

123
00:05:52,642 --> 00:05:58,504
that diagram is a total fake, actually players just scribbled around and did whatever the hell they wanted to,

124
00:05:59,464 --> 00:06:01,525
and there's even a fast travel system in there.

125
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:06,007
structurally looks like the heat map of an open world game, right?

126
00:06:06,347 --> 00:06:08,948
So when we shipped it, we said, hey, it's an open world game.

127
00:06:09,188 --> 00:06:14,190
But we felt kind of wrong about that because it isn't an open world game.

128
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:15,490
And I'll come to that in a moment.

129
00:06:17,441 --> 00:06:22,325
In terms of actually making this thing, we relied on a trick that we stole from 80 Days,

130
00:06:22,505 --> 00:06:26,809
which was the what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas rule.

131
00:06:27,589 --> 00:06:32,113
This is a wilderness full of isolated villages, so if you happen to burn that one to the ground,

132
00:06:32,373 --> 00:06:37,398
or make that one get eaten by a dragon, or set for whatever else you might do...

133
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,504
The people here don't really tell the people there,

134
00:06:40,624 --> 00:06:42,348
look out for this guy, he's a maniac.

135
00:06:43,590 --> 00:06:46,938
So that makes us have less to deal with in terms of consequence.

136
00:06:48,121 --> 00:06:48,341
But...

137
00:06:49,605 --> 00:06:52,345
For part four we bunged all of that together and put you in a city.

138
00:06:52,686 --> 00:06:57,827
So it's very clockwork, part four, there's this little citadel and you're running around

139
00:06:57,887 --> 00:07:02,048
inside it and the characters that you meet have memories, they talk to each other, they

140
00:07:02,128 --> 00:07:03,949
generally remember everything that's going on.

141
00:07:04,409 --> 00:07:09,050
So this really is the most complicated game we've ever made, even though it looks substantially

142
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:11,811
smaller than Sorcery 3 and a lot of the reviews said

143
00:07:12,331 --> 00:07:14,793
meh, it's not as interesting as Sorcery 3.

144
00:07:15,434 --> 00:07:20,718
That's not true, it really is, but maybe it's a more refined kind of taste, I don't know.

145
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:23,160
Anyway, so...

146
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:28,333
Over the course of 35 years, take that Sid Meier,

147
00:07:28,613 --> 00:07:32,176
we've been on a journey from straight choosing

148
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:33,857
our own adventure, what I'm calling

149
00:07:34,037 --> 00:07:36,980
authored branching narrative, because it's branching,

150
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:40,022
and crucially, everything in it has been put there

151
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:44,645
deliberately via this circular narrative

152
00:07:44,725 --> 00:07:47,327
that we had in Sorcery 2 that support loops.

153
00:07:47,387 --> 00:07:50,069
It's not quite linear, through to this open world

154
00:07:50,149 --> 00:07:51,250
free exploration game.

155
00:07:52,191 --> 00:07:54,594
So we've been moving forward along this spectrum.

156
00:07:55,375 --> 00:07:58,939
And this spectrum, it has one big problem with it,

157
00:07:59,059 --> 00:08:02,904
which I hope at least some of you are already thinking.

158
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:06,428
I hope I haven't charmed you sufficiently that you're not thinking it.

159
00:08:06,829 --> 00:08:10,694
The problem with this spectrum or slide is it's a complete load of nonsense.

160
00:08:12,143 --> 00:08:17,106
there is no spectrum from authored branching narrative to open world games.

161
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,708
Authored branching narratives are nothing like open world games.

162
00:08:20,868 --> 00:08:22,789
Open world games are completely different.

163
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,290
And that was why we didn't want to call part three an open world game,

164
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:30,812
because it breaks every single rule of a traditional open world game.

165
00:08:31,751 --> 00:08:34,712
In case you don't believe me, I made a little list of differences.

166
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:39,894
I don't really want to read it all out because you'll get the joke quite quickly, but Open

167
00:08:40,594 --> 00:08:45,436
World Games, infinitely revisitable locations, but they're largely empty or generic.

168
00:08:45,957 --> 00:08:49,778
It's another hut, it's another riverbank, it's another town, it's another blacksmith.

169
00:08:50,718 --> 00:08:53,719
Authored branching narrative, every single location is detailed,

170
00:08:53,879 --> 00:08:57,300
specific, individual, there's no generic content in there at all.

171
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,001
The same applies to characters, characters repeat themselves in open world games,

172
00:09:02,621 --> 00:09:05,702
they never repeat themselves in authored branching narrative games.

173
00:09:06,442 --> 00:09:10,183
The last two points are really important, in an open world game

174
00:09:10,703 --> 00:09:14,884
you can stumble and discover things, you can find things out of order.

175
00:09:15,824 --> 00:09:18,625
You can't do that in an authored branching narrative game.

176
00:09:19,205 --> 00:09:20,045
And crucially, grind.

177
00:09:21,186 --> 00:09:23,947
Grind is a standard component of any open world.

178
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:29,130
Grind in an authored branching narrative is a meaningless concept.

179
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:30,171
It doesn't make any sense.

180
00:09:30,391 --> 00:09:32,472
You cannot have grind in a game book.

181
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:33,312
Like, what would you do?

182
00:09:33,332 --> 00:09:37,595
It would say, right, stop reading now, go away and jump on the spot for 20 seconds

183
00:09:37,615 --> 00:09:39,616
and then come back and carry on reading the book.

184
00:09:40,716 --> 00:09:41,977
There is no mechanic for that.

185
00:09:43,712 --> 00:09:47,594
So, when we came to design part three,

186
00:09:47,794 --> 00:09:49,875
and then carried over into part four,

187
00:09:50,535 --> 00:09:52,096
what we were really trying to do

188
00:09:52,356 --> 00:09:54,817
was make an authored branching narrative,

189
00:09:54,957 --> 00:09:56,238
just like we'd done before,

190
00:09:56,618 --> 00:10:00,520
that survived despite being located

191
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:03,001
in what was superficially an open world.

192
00:10:03,957 --> 00:10:04,777
Well, that's too much.

193
00:10:05,218 --> 00:10:10,820
Actually, what we really did was a narrative which copes in an open world.

194
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:15,441
You can still break it quite happily if you enter the little wilderness portion.

195
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:20,603
Go here, go back, go here, go back, go here, go back, go here, go back.

196
00:10:21,143 --> 00:10:23,384
It won't look like an author-branching narrative anymore.

197
00:10:23,964 --> 00:10:26,545
But I don't think anyone's going to do that.

198
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,166
And if they do, I think it's your fault, not mine.

199
00:10:30,926 --> 00:10:31,126
Sorry.

200
00:10:32,864 --> 00:10:37,329
This is why I think it's a sort of open world, but I also think it's a better open world,

201
00:10:37,429 --> 00:10:39,971
because I'm very happy with it, I'm very proud of it.

202
00:10:40,051 --> 00:10:44,235
So I'm going to tell you how we did it, and if you work for Ubisoft, you can give it a try.

203
00:10:46,613 --> 00:10:50,154
or not, up to you.

204
00:10:50,174 --> 00:10:52,434
It kind of relies on two core components

205
00:10:52,454 --> 00:10:53,514
which are sort of complementary.

206
00:10:53,914 --> 00:10:54,855
The first one is this.

207
00:10:56,475 --> 00:10:58,175
I just had a crack at Ubisoft, but I'm actually

208
00:10:58,235 --> 00:10:59,996
not really talking about Ubisoft games

209
00:11:00,096 --> 00:11:02,456
because there are two kinds of open world

210
00:11:02,676 --> 00:11:03,657
out there anyway.

211
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:06,997
There are mission-based games with sandboxes

212
00:11:07,077 --> 00:11:08,358
which are utterly linear

213
00:11:08,738 --> 00:11:10,978
and the sandbox element doesn't really

214
00:11:11,058 --> 00:11:12,939
feed into that linear at all, really.

215
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:14,879
Except via vague upgrading.

216
00:11:15,399 --> 00:11:19,103
And then there's open world Skyrim Witcher-type games

217
00:11:19,363 --> 00:11:21,425
where there's a morass of quests and sub-quests

218
00:11:21,465 --> 00:11:23,787
that you can drop in and out of at any time.

219
00:11:24,148 --> 00:11:25,489
And that's the kind that I'm talking about.

220
00:11:27,431 --> 00:11:28,352
And this is our first rule.

221
00:11:28,392 --> 00:11:30,013
We don't use quests, we use encounters.

222
00:11:30,153 --> 00:11:31,234
So, what do I mean by that?

223
00:11:32,135 --> 00:11:34,876
Right, the traditional spine of an open world game,

224
00:11:35,196 --> 00:11:38,377
as far as I know, I haven't worked on one directly,

225
00:11:38,497 --> 00:11:41,078
and I've been out of the mainstream industry for about five years,

226
00:11:41,118 --> 00:11:43,938
so maybe you guys are doing crazy, amazing stuff now,

227
00:11:44,318 --> 00:11:45,339
but I don't think you are.

228
00:11:45,659 --> 00:11:46,899
I think this is what you're doing.

229
00:11:48,039 --> 00:11:52,040
You meet someone, you go somewhere, you get something,

230
00:11:52,441 --> 00:11:55,661
you go back to the person you met, and you get a reward.

231
00:11:56,041 --> 00:11:58,522
Amazing. Brilliant.

232
00:12:01,098 --> 00:12:02,758
So, for example, because we need an example.

233
00:12:03,819 --> 00:12:06,801
So I wrote this talk and I sent it to the GDC supervisors

234
00:12:06,881 --> 00:12:09,182
and they said, you need to use examples from sorcery

235
00:12:09,202 --> 00:12:10,363
because, you know, people will like that.

236
00:12:10,703 --> 00:12:12,164
So I went through the whole of sorcery,

237
00:12:12,204 --> 00:12:13,905
that's a million and a half words of content,

238
00:12:14,265 --> 00:12:16,226
and I looked for a quest that had that shape

239
00:12:16,706 --> 00:12:18,007
and I couldn't find one.

240
00:12:18,467 --> 00:12:21,009
So then I played the Witcher for about 10 minutes

241
00:12:21,069 --> 00:12:22,310
and I found one and I nicked it.

242
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,731
So I'm going to be really mean to the Witcher because actually it was really well written

243
00:12:26,991 --> 00:12:29,853
and I did enjoy it but I'm going to make it look stupid.

244
00:12:30,113 --> 00:12:30,833
So there we go.

245
00:12:31,773 --> 00:12:34,214
So here's a quest which is roughly a quest from the Witcher.

246
00:12:35,435 --> 00:12:38,396
You meet someone, you meet a peasant and they say there's a wolf in the woods.

247
00:12:38,436 --> 00:12:40,957
It's probably a werewolf because it's the Witcher but whatever.

248
00:12:41,778 --> 00:12:44,979
So you go to the woods and it turns out there's a wolf in the woods.

249
00:12:46,439 --> 00:12:49,241
So you get the wolf's head because we're gritty.

250
00:12:50,722 --> 00:12:53,364
And you take it back to the peasant and you drop it on his table and he says,

251
00:12:53,924 --> 00:12:56,166
Okay, am I supposed to cook that?

252
00:12:56,186 --> 00:12:57,467
And you go, knock yourself out.

253
00:12:58,128 --> 00:13:00,650
And he says, well if I'm going to eat a wolf's head, you can have my chicken.

254
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:02,451
Have my chicken. I say, thank you very much.

255
00:13:02,772 --> 00:13:03,973
We've told a little story.

256
00:13:04,713 --> 00:13:05,314
Fantastic.

257
00:13:06,615 --> 00:13:06,835
Okay.

258
00:13:08,705 --> 00:13:12,588
So, obviously, this is highly problematic from a narrative point of view.

259
00:13:12,608 --> 00:13:15,111
The first problem being it's kind of dumb.

260
00:13:16,092 --> 00:13:17,373
But there are some proper problems.

261
00:13:17,393 --> 00:13:18,934
There are some actual design problems here.

262
00:13:19,995 --> 00:13:22,818
Firstly, why is this peasant not doing anything about this?

263
00:13:23,118 --> 00:13:25,260
Why is he sitting in a corner of his house looking miserable,

264
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,462
waiting for me to show up and help him out?

265
00:13:28,444 --> 00:13:34,270
If I go hear about the wolf, do nothing, bugger around, buy lots of stuff from the local blacksmith,

266
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:37,533
play Gwent for three hours, why doesn't the peasant care?

267
00:13:37,633 --> 00:13:40,356
Why is he still sitting in the corner looking miserable about this?

268
00:13:40,696 --> 00:13:42,438
Well, okay, as a player I know why.

269
00:13:42,598 --> 00:13:46,942
It's because the quest structure is waiting for me to activate step two of the quest.

270
00:13:46,982 --> 00:13:48,964
But from the narrative point of view...

271
00:13:50,024 --> 00:13:53,986
I've got no options here as a player. I just have to suspend my disbelief.

272
00:13:54,086 --> 00:13:57,948
I have to say, yeah, that guy's a character, but only when I need him to be a character.

273
00:13:58,068 --> 00:14:00,429
When I don't want him to be a character, he's a rock.

274
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:02,170
And that seems like a shame.

275
00:14:02,850 --> 00:14:05,672
And if you do that in a text game, everyone says,

276
00:14:05,872 --> 00:14:08,013
you guys are rubbish, that's a bug.

277
00:14:08,693 --> 00:14:12,935
This is useless. Nobody forgives you in a text game. It's not fair.

278
00:14:15,208 --> 00:14:21,942
In The Witcher they do, and fair enough, it's a beautiful world and they have a lovely horse and sunshine and things, and that's fine!

279
00:14:22,543 --> 00:14:22,904
But, um...

280
00:14:24,227 --> 00:14:25,529
Well, let's try and do better.

281
00:14:27,504 --> 00:14:30,867
Thirdly, why are the woods empty if I go to the woods before the peasant?

282
00:14:31,167 --> 00:14:33,369
And that sounds kind of petty in a big game,

283
00:14:33,750 --> 00:14:35,271
but I did do this in The Witcher.

284
00:14:35,411 --> 00:14:38,555
I went to the Bog of Prickly Marsh, or whatever it is,

285
00:14:38,575 --> 00:14:39,696
and there was nothing there.

286
00:14:39,756 --> 00:14:40,697
And so I thought, OK, fine.

287
00:14:40,757 --> 00:14:42,038
I went there because it had a fun name.

288
00:14:42,538 --> 00:14:44,681
And a bit later, people kept dropping little hints

289
00:14:44,721 --> 00:14:46,583
that I might want to go to the Bog of Prickly Marsh.

290
00:14:46,603 --> 00:14:48,384
And I thought, no, I don't need to go there.

291
00:14:48,424 --> 00:14:49,105
There's nothing there.

292
00:14:49,702 --> 00:14:55,166
And then eventually I didn't know what to do, so I went there and there were these three witches with baskets on their heads and all this crazy stuff.

293
00:14:55,547 --> 00:14:58,229
And I thought, oh, I was actually confused.

294
00:14:58,869 --> 00:15:02,493
I was as confused as when I first played Assassin's Creed and I got my first mission.

295
00:15:02,813 --> 00:15:06,756
And they said, do you want to do this thing, yes or no? And I said, no, I don't want to do that.

296
00:15:07,177 --> 00:15:09,559
And they said, we'll come back later when you do. And I was like, no, you...

297
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:21,424
And finally, the most important one, really, from a narrative point of view.

298
00:15:21,464 --> 00:15:22,926
That stuff is all forgivable, really.

299
00:15:23,206 --> 00:15:27,131
But why does no one else in this world care about the flipping werewolf?

300
00:15:28,177 --> 00:15:31,378
because the problem with the quest structure is it starts with this peasant.

301
00:15:31,438 --> 00:15:33,219
It has to because it ends with that peasant,

302
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:37,162
but that means that nobody else can tell me that there's a wolf in the woods.

303
00:15:37,202 --> 00:15:38,322
They're not allowed to.

304
00:15:38,702 --> 00:15:40,503
The game rules deny it completely.

305
00:15:40,864 --> 00:15:43,385
The only thing they can say, and they'd say this in The Witcher,

306
00:15:43,445 --> 00:15:47,627
is, oh, there's something dark and strange somewhere nearby,

307
00:15:48,128 --> 00:15:50,829
to kind of give me a sense that maybe they know.

308
00:15:51,089 --> 00:15:53,791
But then after I kill the wolf, they're still saying this,

309
00:15:53,851 --> 00:15:56,492
and frankly, that just describes the world of The Witcher anyway.

310
00:15:58,052 --> 00:15:58,176
So.

311
00:15:59,193 --> 00:16:00,393
We kind of thought about these problems.

312
00:16:00,633 --> 00:16:02,494
But the fact is that Sorcery 1,

313
00:16:03,014 --> 00:16:05,295
the one that no one liked that much, that was too short,

314
00:16:05,635 --> 00:16:08,436
actually solves all of these problems anyway

315
00:16:09,776 --> 00:16:11,216
with what we call an encounter.

316
00:16:12,017 --> 00:16:13,937
So that's a term that comes from game book design,

317
00:16:13,977 --> 00:16:16,238
but it also comes from basically from D&D.

318
00:16:16,898 --> 00:16:20,039
And the idea is you're in a branching narrative,

319
00:16:20,159 --> 00:16:22,760
they reconverge, so maybe you come from the left path,

320
00:16:22,860 --> 00:16:23,940
maybe you come from the right path,

321
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:25,661
you hit this encounter, whatever it is,

322
00:16:25,681 --> 00:16:28,361
it deals with it, it does it.

323
00:16:29,202 --> 00:16:30,162
And then off you go.

324
00:16:30,902 --> 00:16:33,802
So specifically, I'm going to the woods,

325
00:16:34,683 --> 00:16:36,543
I come from a path where I know about the wolf,

326
00:16:37,223 --> 00:16:38,923
I come from the path where I don't know about the wolf.

327
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:40,844
Either way, there's a wolf,

328
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:44,164
I do that thing with the wolf that I'm probably gonna do,

329
00:16:45,124 --> 00:16:46,245
and then there's no wolf anymore.

330
00:16:46,265 --> 00:16:50,645
Fine, that's an encounter that resolves the wolf problem.

331
00:16:51,106 --> 00:16:54,726
Now, obviously that doesn't give us our quest narrative.

332
00:16:54,966 --> 00:16:55,926
So how do we do that?

333
00:16:56,346 --> 00:16:56,546
Well,

334
00:16:57,415 --> 00:16:58,756
we make two encounters.

335
00:16:59,597 --> 00:17:02,119
So if I was building this storyline in Sorcery,

336
00:17:02,459 --> 00:17:03,620
here is what I would do,

337
00:17:03,860 --> 00:17:06,402
and I'll take you through the thought process,

338
00:17:06,943 --> 00:17:08,424
the design process that we use

339
00:17:08,444 --> 00:17:11,607
to build every narrative beat in that whole game.

340
00:17:12,388 --> 00:17:13,629
So there are two encounters.

341
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:16,571
There is the peasant's house, and there is the woods.

342
00:17:16,931 --> 00:17:18,212
So what can I do in the peasant's house?

343
00:17:18,253 --> 00:17:19,133
Well, I can meet the peasant,

344
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:20,575
and he'll tell me about the wolf.

345
00:17:20,935 --> 00:17:21,115
Fine.

346
00:17:21,135 --> 00:17:23,417
I can go to the woods, I can encounter the wolf,

347
00:17:23,777 --> 00:17:24,178
I can kill it.

348
00:17:24,738 --> 00:17:24,938
Fine.

349
00:17:26,237 --> 00:17:28,158
Okay, what else might I do?

350
00:17:28,699 --> 00:17:32,180
Well, I might go and meet the peasant,

351
00:17:32,961 --> 00:17:34,081
but I've already seen the wolf,

352
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:36,883
because I might have done these things in the other order.

353
00:17:36,903 --> 00:17:38,324
I might have gone to the woods first.

354
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:39,684
So if I meet the peasant,

355
00:17:39,804 --> 00:17:41,145
and he says, there's a wolf in the woods,

356
00:17:41,305 --> 00:17:42,846
I might say, I know, I've seen it.

357
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:45,387
I might say, I know, I've killed it.

358
00:17:45,908 --> 00:17:47,909
I might say, do you mean this wolf?

359
00:17:48,109 --> 00:17:48,649
Here's its head.

360
00:17:49,089 --> 00:17:50,250
And he goes, well, that's a bit sudden,

361
00:17:50,290 --> 00:17:51,030
but thank you very much.

362
00:17:53,072 --> 00:17:58,317
Equally, I might go to the woods and encounter a wolf, and I might run away.

363
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:03,101
That's a pretty reasonable thing to do if you're in a woods and you see a wolf and you

364
00:18:03,121 --> 00:18:04,922
haven't been promised a chicken for killing it.

365
00:18:05,002 --> 00:18:06,924
You might just think, I'll leave that behind.

366
00:18:07,604 --> 00:18:10,687
So the player is already able to bounce between these two scenes.

367
00:18:11,087 --> 00:18:15,271
Maybe the peasant tells you about the wolf, you go to the woods, you choose to run away,

368
00:18:15,291 --> 00:18:16,372
you go back to the peasant.

369
00:18:16,912 --> 00:18:18,253
Oh, we should probably catch that.

370
00:18:18,414 --> 00:18:18,734
Okay.

371
00:18:19,174 --> 00:18:20,816
So I revisit the peasant.

372
00:18:21,883 --> 00:18:26,725
And I say, sorry, saw your wolf, didn't kill it, haven't really helped you yet.

373
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:30,986
The peasant might say, well this isn't very good, you're supposed to be a witcher.

374
00:18:32,186 --> 00:18:34,027
So all right, I'll encounter the wolf again.

375
00:18:34,987 --> 00:18:37,148
So maybe I kill it, we've covered that, fine.

376
00:18:37,648 --> 00:18:41,949
Otherwise maybe I run away again, because, I don't know, maybe the wolf's really big

377
00:18:42,029 --> 00:18:42,369
actually.

378
00:18:43,270 --> 00:18:44,910
So I go back to the peasant house.

379
00:18:46,448 --> 00:18:48,690
But we need to close this narrative arc off

380
00:18:48,770 --> 00:18:50,951
because it's turning into a bit of a farce at this point.

381
00:18:51,011 --> 00:18:54,132
So, okay, maybe the peasant has disappeared.

382
00:18:54,413 --> 00:18:55,333
He's given up on me.

383
00:18:55,993 --> 00:18:57,714
That's good because that means this house

384
00:18:57,754 --> 00:18:59,255
has no longer got peasant in it

385
00:18:59,335 --> 00:19:00,876
and I don't need to worry about him anymore

386
00:19:01,036 --> 00:19:01,936
as a narrative designer.

387
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:03,357
And I go back to the woods.

388
00:19:03,597 --> 00:19:04,418
There's no sign of the wolf.

389
00:19:04,638 --> 00:19:06,038
He's curled up in his hole, happy.

390
00:19:06,339 --> 00:19:08,240
And I just find the peasant's chewed hat.

391
00:19:08,560 --> 00:19:09,461
lying on the ground.

392
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:12,403
And there we have another ending for our narrative arc.

393
00:19:12,584 --> 00:19:14,005
Wolf's head or peasant's hat.

394
00:19:14,085 --> 00:19:15,106
Those are our two outcomes.

395
00:19:15,546 --> 00:19:17,228
And maybe I can sell the peasant hat

396
00:19:17,268 --> 00:19:19,550
for like three gold pieces in the market.

397
00:19:20,131 --> 00:19:20,351
Fine.

398
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:22,533
And this is how we build sorcery.

399
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:24,194
Basically, you start with a basic quest

400
00:19:24,575 --> 00:19:27,217
and you start just sort of chucking the plot

401
00:19:27,397 --> 00:19:28,939
backwards and forwards between the two,

402
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,042
filling in the sort of possibility space

403
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:33,904
and finding endpoints.

404
00:19:34,862 --> 00:19:36,462
So is this mega complicated to do?

405
00:19:36,542 --> 00:19:40,663
Are we like super geniuses for pulling off this incredible feat of narrative design?

406
00:19:41,003 --> 00:19:43,623
Well, look, it's not as easy as building a quest.

407
00:19:44,664 --> 00:19:48,665
I knocked out what the peasant's house encounter looks like in a flowchart.

408
00:19:49,805 --> 00:19:53,446
If you've ever heard me talk about narrative design before,

409
00:19:53,486 --> 00:19:56,006
you'll know I think that flowcharts are for office managers.

410
00:19:56,426 --> 00:19:59,467
So if you enjoy this, I think there's something wrong with you.

411
00:20:00,947 --> 00:20:03,268
But broadly, the red box is a content.

412
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:08,349
The blue boxes are conditions, and it just kind of drops through from top to bottom.

413
00:20:09,269 --> 00:20:09,969
So I go in.

414
00:20:10,069 --> 00:20:10,929
Is it my first visit?

415
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:11,950
Am I revisiting?

416
00:20:12,070 --> 00:20:12,630
Is my patient?

417
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:13,650
Is my patient?

418
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,410
Is my peasant impatient?

419
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:16,891
Is the peasant gone?

420
00:20:17,791 --> 00:20:18,111
Whatever.

421
00:20:18,131 --> 00:20:18,971
Bosh, bosh, bosh, bosh.

422
00:20:19,451 --> 00:20:23,852
And then either I leave empty-handed, perhaps having increased his level of impatience,

423
00:20:24,353 --> 00:20:25,353
or I get his chicken.

424
00:20:26,033 --> 00:20:30,694
Remember, if he goes off to kill the wolf in the woods, then he's left his chicken behind,

425
00:20:30,794 --> 00:20:32,074
so I can just snarf it anyway.

426
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:33,455
So if the chicken is important...

427
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:34,795
I still win.

428
00:20:37,598 --> 00:20:39,179
How do we actually build this thing?

429
00:20:39,219 --> 00:20:40,660
Well, we don't use flowcharts at Inkle.

430
00:20:41,020 --> 00:20:41,581
We use code.

431
00:20:42,161 --> 00:20:43,502
There's no point calling it anything else.

432
00:20:43,843 --> 00:20:44,603
This is Inc.

433
00:20:44,703 --> 00:20:46,145
This is actually Inc. 1,

434
00:20:46,725 --> 00:20:49,828
which is the version before the version that we open-sourced,

435
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:51,269
which you can play with yourself.

436
00:20:51,709 --> 00:20:52,009
But that's...

437
00:20:53,350 --> 00:20:58,033
Taken from Sorcery 4, where we have a bottleneck outside the chamber where the Archmage, the

438
00:20:58,073 --> 00:21:02,375
super villain of the series is, and you can arrive here on your own.

439
00:21:02,775 --> 00:21:06,237
You can arrive here on your own with only one arm, which is significant because then

440
00:21:06,257 --> 00:21:07,177
you can't cast magic.

441
00:21:07,597 --> 00:21:13,740
You can arrive in the company of a black-clad ninja who may or may not be your lover, with

442
00:21:13,780 --> 00:21:17,902
a girl who can turn invisible when she closes her eyes because she's grown up drinking the

443
00:21:17,922 --> 00:21:18,903
milk of the Snattercat.

444
00:21:19,303 --> 00:21:22,424
with a small little demon thing that also stops you casting spells,

445
00:21:22,464 --> 00:21:24,645
which is a convenient confluence of logic,

446
00:21:25,605 --> 00:21:27,506
or nobody, or a combination of the two,

447
00:21:28,486 --> 00:21:30,867
and possibly with the body of a person

448
00:21:30,907 --> 00:21:32,988
that you accidentally killed on the floor here as well.

449
00:21:33,328 --> 00:21:36,669
And all of those states are handled by the green things.

450
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,270
The green things are little logical conditionals,

451
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:41,291
and they sit on every line of text,

452
00:21:41,751 --> 00:21:43,312
and pretty much every option,

453
00:21:43,512 --> 00:21:45,853
the options are the red star things at the bottom.

454
00:21:46,453 --> 00:21:49,474
saying, if this logic thing is true, this is allowed.

455
00:21:49,754 --> 00:21:51,035
If it's not true, it's not allowed.

456
00:21:51,175 --> 00:21:52,476
So we just switch things on and off,

457
00:21:52,776 --> 00:21:53,756
depending on the context.

458
00:21:55,257 --> 00:21:57,258
The interesting thing that I want to point out as well

459
00:21:57,358 --> 00:21:59,199
is at the very, very bottom of the slide,

460
00:21:59,399 --> 00:22:01,980
there's one option with no green things,

461
00:22:02,460 --> 00:22:05,241
one option with no logic, which is ready myself.

462
00:22:06,132 --> 00:22:09,574
Now, speaking as a writer to a room of people who may be writers,

463
00:22:10,415 --> 00:22:12,596
ready myself is a rubbish option.

464
00:22:12,976 --> 00:22:15,617
I'm at the end of a four-part adventure,

465
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:19,739
I'm outside the Mount Doom location of the whole story,

466
00:22:19,819 --> 00:22:21,680
and I choose ready myself.

467
00:22:22,261 --> 00:22:23,021
Well, that's nice.

468
00:22:23,902 --> 00:22:29,329
So it's a little bit above brush my teeth as a thing to do before preparing for a final battle.

469
00:22:29,589 --> 00:22:36,439
But we have to have it because I have no idea what circumstance you're arriving in this location in.

470
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:39,463
I've got no idea what combination of factors you've got switched on or off.

471
00:22:39,964 --> 00:22:42,866
and I need to make sure you've got something you can do.

472
00:22:43,226 --> 00:22:45,188
So that's a kind of fallback option for players

473
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:47,609
who have had the most dull experience in the world,

474
00:22:47,890 --> 00:22:49,991
who have just wandered into this location,

475
00:22:50,011 --> 00:22:52,473
no idea what's going on, haven't prepared.

476
00:22:52,753 --> 00:22:54,555
Well, at least they get to ready themselves.

477
00:22:54,615 --> 00:22:55,536
That's nice, isn't it?

478
00:22:56,877 --> 00:22:57,957
That is in the game as well.

479
00:22:58,218 --> 00:23:01,200
So to describe what this principle really is,

480
00:23:02,241 --> 00:23:04,242
we call it defensive logic.

481
00:23:05,043 --> 00:23:06,624
That's our in-house name for it.

482
00:23:07,024 --> 00:23:11,868
So the idea is we build every encounter in a completely ad hoc way.

483
00:23:12,889 --> 00:23:16,712
Every single scene is written to cope regardless of the game state.

484
00:23:16,892 --> 00:23:19,594
We make no assumptions about what you know or what you don't know

485
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,896
when you get to the peasant's house, when you get to the woods,

486
00:23:22,096 --> 00:23:23,637
when you get to the Archmage, whatever.

487
00:23:24,277 --> 00:23:27,940
We will cope with things like the player not knowing

488
00:23:28,140 --> 00:23:29,922
that the Archmage is in that room.

489
00:23:31,236 --> 00:23:34,279
even if that's probably impossible to generate,

490
00:23:34,680 --> 00:23:36,722
because it's much harder for us to work out

491
00:23:36,922 --> 00:23:39,404
what states are possible and impossible

492
00:23:39,825 --> 00:23:42,388
than it is to just cover the case anyway.

493
00:23:42,988 --> 00:23:45,451
And generally speaking, as the game expands,

494
00:23:45,851 --> 00:23:47,453
you start to hook things back together

495
00:23:47,833 --> 00:23:50,316
and things that were impossible become possible.

496
00:23:50,696 --> 00:23:54,543
and then finally you ship the game and your players find that things that you were sure

497
00:23:54,583 --> 00:23:56,747
were impossible are in fact possible.

498
00:23:57,208 --> 00:24:00,594
And if you've caught it, they think you're magic, and if they haven't caught it, you

499
00:24:00,634 --> 00:24:02,577
patch it because they're right and you're wrong.

500
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,392
The way that we do defensive logic is just with preconditions.

501
00:24:07,732 --> 00:24:10,233
We shove logic, those little green things,

502
00:24:10,693 --> 00:24:13,875
on pretty much every line of text, on every action.

503
00:24:14,095 --> 00:24:17,616
We just constantly guard the story against going the wrong way.

504
00:24:17,757 --> 00:24:19,758
So if you're going to talk to Flanker the Assassin,

505
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:22,239
every single time you do that, it'll say...

506
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,220
Have you got Flanker? Are you sure you've got Flanker?

507
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:26,180
Have you still got Flanker?

508
00:24:26,280 --> 00:24:29,101
It's like my mum when I go out of the house when she's staying with us

509
00:24:29,541 --> 00:24:30,741
and she's saying, have you got your keys?

510
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:31,822
Have you still got your keys?

511
00:24:32,142 --> 00:24:33,302
You really need your keys now.

512
00:24:34,223 --> 00:24:35,123
It's defensive logic.

513
00:24:35,183 --> 00:24:38,104
It's making sure that absolutely, definitely you don't lock yourself out.

514
00:24:39,865 --> 00:24:41,085
And then finally we have a fallback.

515
00:24:41,466 --> 00:24:42,887
That's the ready myself option.

516
00:24:43,407 --> 00:24:45,388
It's the what happens when nothing can happen.

517
00:24:46,309 --> 00:24:50,071
And in general our principle is that fallbacks should be competent,

518
00:24:50,612 --> 00:24:52,193
but they shouldn't be interesting.

519
00:24:53,013 --> 00:24:56,055
The main use for a fallback in reality

520
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:59,518
is for when a player does that thing of going backwards and forwards

521
00:24:59,538 --> 00:25:01,819
and backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards and backwards and forwards

522
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:03,980
and you don't actually want to reward that player,

523
00:25:04,401 --> 00:25:07,303
you want to just get out of the way as fast as possible.

524
00:25:07,764 --> 00:25:12,376
Whatever reason they're doing that for is their business. The story should just shut up for a while

525
00:25:14,083 --> 00:25:17,786
Interestingly, that's probably less important for a game like The Witcher.

526
00:25:18,366 --> 00:25:20,808
In Sorcery, we cannot have a blank location.

527
00:25:20,868 --> 00:25:23,811
If you're walking from here to here, across a path or something,

528
00:25:23,871 --> 00:25:27,173
we have to narrate every step of that journey because text is all we've got.

529
00:25:27,634 --> 00:25:30,016
In The Witcher, you can probably just travel in silence for a while.

530
00:25:30,276 --> 00:25:31,817
You may not even need fallbacks.

531
00:25:32,057 --> 00:25:35,340
If you enter an empty hut in The Witcher, it's just an empty hut.

532
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,702
You don't need to have Geralt say,

533
00:25:37,722 --> 00:25:41,245
I looked around the empty hut and thought, oh, nothing here.

534
00:25:43,793 --> 00:25:45,575
So that's how we build our encounters.

535
00:25:45,635 --> 00:25:47,876
Now, encounters are critical, and breaking away

536
00:25:47,896 --> 00:25:49,337
from the quest structure and moving towards

537
00:25:49,357 --> 00:25:51,939
the encounter structure allows us to tell narratives

538
00:25:52,199 --> 00:25:54,881
which the quest structure sort of implied,

539
00:25:55,362 --> 00:25:57,163
like the peasant and his hat,

540
00:25:57,944 --> 00:26:00,045
but didn't actually support or allow.

541
00:26:00,165 --> 00:26:03,588
So our system has already beaten the Witcher system

542
00:26:03,748 --> 00:26:05,269
in that we can give you multiple ways

543
00:26:05,309 --> 00:26:07,590
to play the same plot and get the chicken at the end.

544
00:26:08,531 --> 00:26:11,735
So, when I said that I thought it was better, it's because I think it's better.

545
00:26:12,676 --> 00:26:15,559
But, there are still problems to solve, and that's why we need the second thing,

546
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:17,642
which is state modeling.

547
00:26:18,303 --> 00:26:20,906
So, in a normal open world game...

548
00:26:21,954 --> 00:26:25,335
The player's knowledge of the world and the state of the plot

549
00:26:25,575 --> 00:26:28,536
are both outputs of the quest system.

550
00:26:28,996 --> 00:26:30,676
So that means if you want to know,

551
00:26:31,096 --> 00:26:32,297
does the player know something,

552
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:34,117
you just look at the relevant quest and say,

553
00:26:34,157 --> 00:26:35,337
have you got to this stage yet?

554
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:38,818
Like, should I put the witches in Crinkly Bog Manor Marsh?

555
00:26:39,158 --> 00:26:41,219
Well, has the player hit that stage of the quest?

556
00:26:41,239 --> 00:26:41,959
Do they know about them?

557
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:43,119
If so, yes, otherwise no.

558
00:26:44,120 --> 00:26:45,220
And that's very robust.

559
00:26:45,300 --> 00:26:45,980
It's very simple.

560
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:46,860
It's very clear.

561
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:48,901
You know where all the information is.

562
00:26:48,941 --> 00:26:50,061
It's in the quest system.

563
00:26:50,821 --> 00:26:51,382
We can't do that.

564
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:57,062
Actually querying encounters to work out what you've seen and what you haven't seen,

565
00:26:57,122 --> 00:27:00,204
what you've done, where you've been, is horrendously complicated

566
00:27:00,724 --> 00:27:04,066
and kind of breaks the point of ad hoc design anyway

567
00:27:04,486 --> 00:27:07,308
because you want to make your encounters, like your peasant encounter,

568
00:27:07,648 --> 00:27:10,690
in such a way that you can come back to them three weeks later,

569
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:13,511
having completely forgotten how they fit into the rest of the game,

570
00:27:13,891 --> 00:27:15,252
and add more fiddly stuff.

571
00:27:15,692 --> 00:27:17,354
or cope with another consequence,

572
00:27:17,414 --> 00:27:20,236
or handle the fact that you might actually have a companion with you now,

573
00:27:20,376 --> 00:27:21,536
or all of this sort of stuff.

574
00:27:21,636 --> 00:27:24,939
And you don't want to break queries being used elsewhere in the game

575
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,720
by adding that complexity.

576
00:27:27,040 --> 00:27:30,262
So what we do is we model all the plot and all the player knowledge

577
00:27:30,443 --> 00:27:32,424
outside of that with a separate system.

578
00:27:32,844 --> 00:27:35,346
And hopefully you will enjoy what the system looks like,

579
00:27:35,646 --> 00:27:37,668
because it looks like a state machine.

580
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:41,571
And again, hopefully some of you are saying,

581
00:27:41,852 --> 00:27:43,353
ah, that's a quest, isn't it?

582
00:27:43,393 --> 00:27:44,794
You've just said you don't do quests,

583
00:27:44,834 --> 00:27:46,335
and you put quests right back in again.

584
00:27:47,476 --> 00:27:49,197
So my job for the next 30 seconds

585
00:27:49,217 --> 00:27:51,819
will be to convince you that this is not a quest.

586
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:54,341
But it looks a bit like the quest.

587
00:27:54,842 --> 00:27:56,223
So here's our state machine for the wolf.

588
00:27:57,085 --> 00:27:58,846
and it tracks the wolf plot.

589
00:27:59,366 --> 00:28:01,728
So to start with, I know nothing about a wolf.

590
00:28:02,349 --> 00:28:04,130
Then I know about a wolf, then I've seen a wolf,

591
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:06,872
then I've killed a wolf, and finally I've cut a wolf's head off.

592
00:28:07,292 --> 00:28:12,015
The peasant, being a human being, is worthy of two state charts

593
00:28:13,536 --> 00:28:16,298
mapping the two things that the peasant can sort of move through.

594
00:28:16,318 --> 00:28:17,819
I can meet him.

595
00:28:18,928 --> 00:28:22,470
I can hear about the wolf, and he can be grateful that I've killed the wolf, fine.

596
00:28:23,411 --> 00:28:27,333
Or he can get impatient, he can go, and then I can find him dead.

597
00:28:29,314 --> 00:28:33,137
But I'm asserting that these are definitely not quests in disguise.

598
00:28:33,297 --> 00:28:34,878
And the reason for that is really simple.

599
00:28:37,099 --> 00:28:39,840
The trees are not player targets.

600
00:28:40,361 --> 00:28:43,823
I'm not presenting these to the player, in fact the player will never see them.

601
00:28:44,283 --> 00:28:47,945
And I'm not saying you're supposed to max out every single one of these trees.

602
00:28:48,719 --> 00:28:51,001
In fact, they're probably mutually exclusive.

603
00:28:52,242 --> 00:28:53,443
They are not quests.

604
00:28:54,024 --> 00:28:56,045
They're not there to provide the player with a goal.

605
00:28:56,266 --> 00:29:00,129
They're there for me, as the narrative designer, to work out what the bloody hell is going

606
00:29:00,249 --> 00:29:01,370
on from moment to moment.

607
00:29:03,992 --> 00:29:05,473
So, how do we use them?

608
00:29:06,587 --> 00:29:10,732
Well, we have one particular thing which makes them super useful

609
00:29:10,813 --> 00:29:15,018
and I think is quite clever, and that's that the way we design the state machines

610
00:29:15,439 --> 00:29:21,167
is one, there's one important rule which is that states always imply their previous states.

611
00:29:21,994 --> 00:29:24,437
So if your current position in the game is this,

612
00:29:24,977 --> 00:29:27,060
I've seen the wolf, I've been told about the wolf,

613
00:29:27,540 --> 00:29:29,182
and the peasant's getting impatient with me,

614
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:31,706
what that really means is this.

615
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,928
I know about the wolf and I've seen it.

616
00:29:34,409 --> 00:29:36,211
I've met the peasant and I've been told about it,

617
00:29:36,552 --> 00:29:37,873
and the peasant's getting impatient with me.

618
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:42,461
So every state in our state tree is a high watermark.

619
00:29:42,601 --> 00:29:45,842
It says you've got this high, and everything below it

620
00:29:45,882 --> 00:29:46,622
is also true.

621
00:29:46,942 --> 00:29:48,802
And that's really powerful, because it

622
00:29:48,843 --> 00:29:51,343
means that if you want to set a state, you just set a state,

623
00:29:51,783 --> 00:29:53,344
and all of this stuff comes in for free.

624
00:29:53,984 --> 00:29:56,985
And if you edit that state chart to add a bit more granularity,

625
00:29:57,385 --> 00:29:59,605
perhaps the peasant has hinted about the wolf,

626
00:29:59,946 --> 00:30:01,666
and then the peasant has told you about the wolf.

627
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:04,527
You can do that without breaking a single query in your game.

628
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:07,528
Because if you're testing, well, have I heard about the wolf?

629
00:30:08,285 --> 00:30:13,326
I'm still covered, because I'm just adding stuff into the detail of the high watermark.

630
00:30:13,506 --> 00:30:17,807
If you imagine I'm just adding another division between what I want to test and what I don't

631
00:30:17,827 --> 00:30:18,307
want to test.

632
00:30:19,228 --> 00:30:25,029
So in practice, what that kind of means is we query states, we say, have you reached

633
00:30:25,049 --> 00:30:25,589
this state?

634
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:26,990
Do I know about the wolf?

635
00:30:27,230 --> 00:30:27,350
Yeah.

636
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:28,610
Have I seen the wolf?

637
00:30:28,790 --> 00:30:28,930
Yeah.

638
00:30:29,731 --> 00:30:30,431
Have I killed the wolf?

639
00:30:30,471 --> 00:30:30,611
No.

640
00:30:31,131 --> 00:30:31,331
Fine.

641
00:30:31,651 --> 00:30:31,871
Easy.

642
00:30:32,331 --> 00:30:35,912
And more often, we test between states.

643
00:30:36,372 --> 00:30:36,893
So we say.

644
00:30:37,988 --> 00:30:41,691
Am I between having been told of the wolf and having killed the wolf?

645
00:30:41,992 --> 00:30:46,056
If so, that means the player is expecting there to be a wolf in the woods.

646
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:51,381
And I can use that to change the way the narrative says, you know,

647
00:30:51,661 --> 00:30:54,203
how you enter the woods. You're expecting a wolf to be there.

648
00:30:54,984 --> 00:31:00,205
Similarly, is the state between having met the peasant and the peasant having gone?

649
00:31:00,725 --> 00:31:05,647
If so, it doesn't matter what the exact state set up is at all.

650
00:31:05,907 --> 00:31:08,547
If I've met him and he hasn't left, I think he's at home.

651
00:31:09,308 --> 00:31:11,368
It doesn't matter if he's impatient or not impatient.

652
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:12,648
It doesn't matter if he's happy or sad.

653
00:31:12,688 --> 00:31:16,009
It doesn't matter how many times I've tried to steal his chicken from him under his nose.

654
00:31:16,889 --> 00:31:20,470
If I've met him and he hasn't gone, then I know he should be at home.

655
00:31:21,988 --> 00:31:25,730
And so this gives us a really quick, really light touch way

656
00:31:26,251 --> 00:31:27,911
of assessing logical situations.

657
00:31:28,191 --> 00:31:31,593
But we still have lots and lots of granularity.

658
00:31:31,613 --> 00:31:35,095
So I can test for exact combinations that I want.

659
00:31:36,655 --> 00:31:38,096
And I'll demonstrate that in just a moment.

660
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:42,638
One more point just to really get this idea in.

661
00:31:42,898 --> 00:31:44,059
When you're changing state.

662
00:31:45,715 --> 00:31:48,496
We use this command in Ink, which we've made,

663
00:31:48,536 --> 00:31:49,837
which is called moveToState,

664
00:31:50,077 --> 00:31:52,719
and it doesn't do anything if you've already hit the state.

665
00:31:53,139 --> 00:31:54,860
That's kind of a high-watermark idea.

666
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:59,583
So if I move to knowAboutWolf in this example,

667
00:31:59,803 --> 00:32:02,124
nothing happens, because I already know about the wolf.

668
00:32:02,958 --> 00:32:07,840
I don't edit the sort of highest states because I've just earned the lowest state, it wouldn't

669
00:32:07,880 --> 00:32:08,561
make sense to.

670
00:32:10,001 --> 00:32:15,144
But if I move to the state peasant found dead, then it whoops through this state tree and

671
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:17,245
now I'm expecting the peasant to be gone as well.

672
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,147
So if somewhere else in the story it says, do you think the peasant should be gone?

673
00:32:22,128 --> 00:32:25,329
the story will still report true because, hell yeah, I just found him dead.

674
00:32:25,449 --> 00:32:26,770
Of course I expect him to be gone.

675
00:32:27,110 --> 00:32:28,430
So I get that state for free.

676
00:32:29,271 --> 00:32:31,111
So what these really are is they're not quests.

677
00:32:31,492 --> 00:32:34,973
They're state trees that depict the causality in your game.

678
00:32:35,613 --> 00:32:38,134
The thing that caused the thing that caused the thing that caused the thing.

679
00:32:38,454 --> 00:32:41,876
And that can be player knowledge or it can be plot events.

680
00:32:42,616 --> 00:32:45,857
And they let us capture an enormous amount of complexity.

681
00:32:46,377 --> 00:32:46,858
For example.

682
00:32:48,585 --> 00:32:51,585
I've been playing the game for a while, and this is my state tree.

683
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:57,167
So the question that I put to you is, what's the current state of the story?

684
00:32:58,007 --> 00:33:00,707
What has happened to the player to achieve this?

685
00:33:01,108 --> 00:33:06,749
So the wolf's head has been cut off, the peasant has told me about the wolf, and the peasant

686
00:33:06,789 --> 00:33:07,669
has been found dead.

687
00:33:08,609 --> 00:33:09,409
So what's happened?

688
00:33:09,930 --> 00:33:10,150
Well...

689
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,133
The peasant told me about the wolf, but I didn't do anything.

690
00:33:14,774 --> 00:33:15,874
He became impatient.

691
00:33:16,575 --> 00:33:18,016
He went out to go and kill it.

692
00:33:18,616 --> 00:33:21,157
I found his body, and I killed the wolf in revenge.

693
00:33:22,459 --> 00:33:27,880
That's a narrative that did not exist in the original Quest example that I started with.

694
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:30,601
It just wasn't there. It wasn't possible.

695
00:33:31,021 --> 00:33:33,541
Is that emergent procedural storytelling?

696
00:33:33,561 --> 00:33:38,322
I don't know. It's made out of little pieces that fit themselves together.

697
00:33:38,362 --> 00:33:41,923
But it is a unique narrative to me based on exactly what I did.

698
00:33:42,963 --> 00:33:46,744
And you don't get that in any open world games.

699
00:33:47,324 --> 00:33:48,944
So I think that's incredibly exciting.

700
00:33:48,984 --> 00:33:51,805
And I also think that diagram is incredibly simple.

701
00:33:53,145 --> 00:33:56,488
There are what, 10 states there?

702
00:33:56,548 --> 00:33:58,670
13 if you count the null states at the beginning of the tree.

703
00:33:58,710 --> 00:34:01,053
That is not a lot of information to keep track of.

704
00:34:01,393 --> 00:34:08,679
But the subtlety that it stores is, I think, quite exciting.

705
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,682
And if you've played sorcery and ever had those moments

706
00:34:11,722 --> 00:34:14,104
of sort of, wow, it's really listening to me, magic,

707
00:34:14,144 --> 00:34:15,005
that's what's going on.

708
00:34:15,045 --> 00:34:16,467
There's just lots of little state machines

709
00:34:16,987 --> 00:34:18,168
futzing around in the background.

710
00:34:19,237 --> 00:34:21,621
Cool, so I've raved about how we make our things,

711
00:34:21,742 --> 00:34:23,104
and that's all very well and good.

712
00:34:24,406 --> 00:34:28,734
And I want to talk a bit more about the benefits

713
00:34:28,934 --> 00:34:30,497
and a bit more about the costs,

714
00:34:30,517 --> 00:34:32,400
because of course this approach has both.

715
00:34:34,007 --> 00:34:38,048
But I won't bore you with repetition, so I'll talk about some of the unexpected benefits.

716
00:34:38,508 --> 00:34:43,070
The important thing to remember is we didn't do this because we're super clever and we

717
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:44,030
had a big idea.

718
00:34:44,110 --> 00:34:45,511
We didn't theorize this.

719
00:34:46,091 --> 00:34:51,473
We built Sorcery 1, we built Sorcery 2, and then we built Sorcery 3 as close to the previous

720
00:34:51,533 --> 00:34:53,394
books as we could possibly manage.

721
00:34:53,834 --> 00:34:56,315
We used encounters because we'd used them before.

722
00:34:57,035 --> 00:35:00,837
Because we didn't want to make a completely different game and surprise everybody.

723
00:35:01,117 --> 00:35:04,680
We wanted everyone to think, oh, it's just Sorcery 1, but with backtracking.

724
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,401
Which is kind of what they thought.

725
00:35:08,242 --> 00:35:12,425
But having built it that way, we saw a few things emerge from that design.

726
00:35:13,566 --> 00:35:15,167
The first is my favorite.

727
00:35:15,247 --> 00:35:16,327
It's the most important.

728
00:35:16,447 --> 00:35:20,490
It's the one that I think that really elevates this, which is plots can start in different

729
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:20,730
ways.

730
00:35:22,083 --> 00:35:24,687
That's impossible in The Witcher, to my knowledge anyway.

731
00:35:24,767 --> 00:35:25,868
I haven't seen their tool set.

732
00:35:27,270 --> 00:35:30,775
In particular, anyone in the world can tell you

733
00:35:31,176 --> 00:35:32,117
about the wolf in the woods.

734
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:32,938
Anyone.

735
00:35:33,847 --> 00:35:36,427
any single individual in that village can say,

736
00:35:36,747 --> 00:35:37,728
there's a wolf in the woods.

737
00:35:38,068 --> 00:35:40,388
We move your state to now you know about the wolf.

738
00:35:41,048 --> 00:35:42,409
Okay, well what if you then go and talk

739
00:35:42,429 --> 00:35:43,469
to the peasant with the chicken?

740
00:35:43,949 --> 00:35:45,930
Well, fine, we've covered that already.

741
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:48,250
You walk in, he says there's a wolf in the woods,

742
00:35:48,490 --> 00:35:49,731
will you say, I already know.

743
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:51,491
I haven't been there, I haven't seen it yet.

744
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:54,132
We've actually covered that eventuality already

745
00:35:54,812 --> 00:35:57,993
because we're tracking the player's knowledge separately

746
00:35:58,413 --> 00:36:02,154
from the encounter itself.

747
00:36:03,045 --> 00:36:07,470
the encounter just copes, because we did it in an ad hoc defensive way, so that it would cope.

748
00:36:07,970 --> 00:36:13,156
So I can add in during the writing process, at any point, warnings about the wolf.

749
00:36:13,236 --> 00:36:17,420
I can put this near the beginning of the game if I want to, for some people who find a certain thing.

750
00:36:18,321 --> 00:36:22,626
And I can do that freely, I can do that in the beta testing stage, and it's utterly robust.

751
00:36:23,066 --> 00:36:25,589
Well, not utterly robust, but it's quite robust.

752
00:36:27,193 --> 00:36:33,535
Secondly, to develop that idea, we use our state trees to drive the plot forward.

753
00:36:33,695 --> 00:36:40,157
So in Sorcery 4, on your way to the Archmage, the big barrier are these things called the

754
00:36:40,237 --> 00:36:41,177
Throbin Doors.

755
00:36:41,877 --> 00:36:45,138
And to start with, you've never heard of them, and this is their state tree.

756
00:36:45,279 --> 00:36:46,899
So firstly I've heard of them, great.

757
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:48,680
Then I know that they're locked.

758
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,241
Oh, what a surprise.

759
00:36:51,302 --> 00:36:53,384
Then I learned that only sorcerers can open them.

760
00:36:53,744 --> 00:36:55,286
Luckily, guess what my job is?

761
00:36:56,207 --> 00:36:58,449
Then I learned that they're locked by spells.

762
00:36:58,849 --> 00:37:00,011
Intriguing, OK.

763
00:37:00,311 --> 00:37:01,772
And then I learned that they require

764
00:37:01,872 --> 00:37:03,154
counter spells to open them.

765
00:37:03,294 --> 00:37:05,136
And then the player goes off and finds out what those

766
00:37:05,176 --> 00:37:07,938
counter spells are, and we've got a lock and key system.

767
00:37:08,058 --> 00:37:08,939
Brilliant, go me.

768
00:37:11,061 --> 00:37:11,222
But.

769
00:37:12,127 --> 00:37:15,769
As I wander around the world, several characters in this world,

770
00:37:16,009 --> 00:37:19,551
pretty much all of them actually, can give me a clue

771
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:24,754
towards the puzzle of the Throban doors, and whatever I do, whoever I help,

772
00:37:25,014 --> 00:37:27,276
they will always give me the next clue along.

773
00:37:27,576 --> 00:37:29,077
No one will ever just tell me the answer,

774
00:37:29,437 --> 00:37:31,438
no one will ever repeat a clue I've heard before.

775
00:37:31,719 --> 00:37:35,061
They'll look at what I've got, and they'll give me a nudge along.

776
00:37:35,381 --> 00:37:36,401
Fine. Really simple.

777
00:37:38,301 --> 00:37:40,043
You might say, that's cheating.

778
00:37:40,824 --> 00:37:42,986
How does this guy here know that they're locked

779
00:37:43,006 --> 00:37:43,767
by counter spells?

780
00:37:43,807 --> 00:37:45,528
How does this one know that there are doors?

781
00:37:45,929 --> 00:37:47,510
Shouldn't people know what they know?

782
00:37:47,731 --> 00:37:49,833
If the player rewinds and goes a different way,

783
00:37:49,933 --> 00:37:51,955
shouldn't they get the same dialogue from that character?

784
00:37:52,436 --> 00:37:53,437
No, obviously not.

785
00:37:54,337 --> 00:37:55,138
That's a stupid idea.

786
00:37:57,780 --> 00:38:01,843
To be a little less glib, it's necessary in an ad hoc game.

787
00:38:02,604 --> 00:38:06,387
When you get to any given point, we have absolutely no idea

788
00:38:06,707 --> 00:38:09,209
where you've been, what you've seen, who you've talked to.

789
00:38:09,529 --> 00:38:12,111
There might be someone with a critical piece of clue information

790
00:38:12,131 --> 00:38:14,813
who you accidentally blew up from the outside of his house

791
00:38:14,853 --> 00:38:17,075
without thinking about it, and you never even met.

792
00:38:17,655 --> 00:38:19,017
We support that kind of thing,

793
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:23,140
so we cannot put key piece of evidence in only one place.

794
00:38:24,021 --> 00:38:27,063
Or if we do, we have to do that incredibly carefully.

795
00:38:28,685 --> 00:38:29,786
And I'll mention that again in a moment.

796
00:38:32,008 --> 00:38:32,949
So, okay, cool.

797
00:38:33,830 --> 00:38:38,494
The other thing that it gave us was simulationist gameplay-ish sort of thing.

798
00:38:39,796 --> 00:38:42,438
We're obviously not a sandbox game, and we don't pretend to be.

799
00:38:43,219 --> 00:38:46,341
But there's a couple of places where we've managed to do sandbox elements,

800
00:38:46,381 --> 00:38:47,782
which has been really exciting.

801
00:38:48,322 --> 00:38:51,404
So in Sorcery 3, there's this guy who is the Sun Serpent.

802
00:38:51,705 --> 00:38:53,126
Water is his kryptonite.

803
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:56,028
Once you learn that, you can look at the map.

804
00:38:56,548 --> 00:38:59,650
And any river, lake, or pool, if you go there,

805
00:38:59,910 --> 00:39:03,793
there'll be an option to drop the orb that he's trapped in into the water,

806
00:39:04,033 --> 00:39:08,156
and it runs the fight a wet Sun Serpent encounter.

807
00:39:09,017 --> 00:39:12,499
I think I said earlier that encounters are often locations,

808
00:39:12,559 --> 00:39:14,279
but they don't have to be locations.

809
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,301
In this case, that particular fight is an encounter

810
00:39:17,661 --> 00:39:20,123
that we just plug in wherever we need it to be.

811
00:39:20,443 --> 00:39:21,743
It's got a precondition that says,

812
00:39:21,763 --> 00:39:25,205
do you actually have the orb with the sun serpent?

813
00:39:25,285 --> 00:39:27,186
If so, here's the option to drop it in,

814
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:28,827
do the fight, and then come back.

815
00:39:29,247 --> 00:39:31,969
If any of you have been using ink, that is a tunnel.

816
00:39:32,389 --> 00:39:33,230
It just uses a tunnel.

817
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,051
It blobs off and does it, and then it comes back again.

818
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:41,393
A beta tester also pointed out that they wanted to be able to throw it into the mouth of the water serpent

819
00:39:41,753 --> 00:39:46,355
Because the Sun Serpent and the water serpent are like these star-crossed lovers who can never be together

820
00:39:46,435 --> 00:39:51,536
Isn't that tragic? Doesn't that make you well up inside? So we added that and that was a lot of fun

821
00:39:52,277 --> 00:39:57,598
That isn't really an example of simulations gameplay though because we wrote a bespoke little piece for that. Whatever. I just like it

822
00:39:59,075 --> 00:40:04,919
Another example along the same lines, there's a section of Sorcery 3's map,

823
00:40:05,199 --> 00:40:08,141
it's actually a third of the entire map is a lake.

824
00:40:09,281 --> 00:40:13,164
It's actually just one location in the game, with a coordinate.

825
00:40:14,125 --> 00:40:18,268
the player moves from an identical lake location to an identical lake location to an identical

826
00:40:18,308 --> 00:40:23,092
lake location, obviously that would get quite dull quite fast, so what we do is we have

827
00:40:23,112 --> 00:40:27,095
a big bag of encounters and we just pull from it to give them content.

828
00:40:27,556 --> 00:40:29,697
And by doing it that way, we can balance it.

829
00:40:30,078 --> 00:40:32,480
We can balance the drama against the quiet moments.

830
00:40:32,700 --> 00:40:35,782
If they're really tanking on stamina, we can give them a rest.

831
00:40:36,483 --> 00:40:38,405
If they're doing well, we can give them a monster.

832
00:40:38,866 --> 00:40:41,429
We give them a fight with the water serpent,

833
00:40:41,709 --> 00:40:44,152
but we make sure we do it when they're far away from land,

834
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:45,333
so it's a bit more dramatic.

835
00:40:46,214 --> 00:40:48,276
Even better, we have a bag of content

836
00:40:48,336 --> 00:40:50,318
for when they're swimming, a bag of content

837
00:40:50,339 --> 00:40:52,561
for when they're rowing, and a bag of content

838
00:40:52,601 --> 00:40:54,683
for when they're in a boat with a grumpy ferryman.

839
00:40:55,444 --> 00:41:01,505
And because we have that, that means that the player can jump overboard at any given time.

840
00:41:01,805 --> 00:41:03,646
We just switch them to the swimming content.

841
00:41:04,106 --> 00:41:09,227
But they can also push the ferryman out of the boat and then end up in the rowing state and row off.

842
00:41:09,687 --> 00:41:15,748
And we can do that anywhere on the map because we just flip from one encounter to the other using our system.

843
00:41:15,788 --> 00:41:18,888
We just say, what state are you in now? Okay, have some swimming content.

844
00:41:21,069 --> 00:41:21,329
Cool.

845
00:41:22,435 --> 00:41:25,064
So simulationist gameplay, if you think about it,

846
00:41:25,585 --> 00:41:28,495
means that we can start to have strategic gameplay.

847
00:41:29,664 --> 00:41:34,248
So in Sorcery 3 and 4, we started to add new mechanics,

848
00:41:34,768 --> 00:41:36,069
adding a level of strategy.

849
00:41:36,309 --> 00:41:39,032
Now strategy, you don't normally get strategy

850
00:41:39,152 --> 00:41:40,873
in choose-your-own-adventure type games,

851
00:41:40,934 --> 00:41:42,955
because the player has no way of predicting

852
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:45,678
what's going to happen later based on what's going on now.

853
00:41:46,118 --> 00:41:49,141
Normally, strategy is reserved for the other talk

854
00:41:49,921 --> 00:41:51,483
that I've mentioned too many times already.

855
00:41:52,484 --> 00:41:53,605
But we do have some strategy.

856
00:41:54,426 --> 00:41:58,832
In Sorcery 3, if you've played it, you'll know that there are time beacons.

857
00:41:59,052 --> 00:42:01,075
That's what they look like, it's like a beam of light,

858
00:42:01,756 --> 00:42:08,405
and in the light, the wilderness wasteland reverts to how it was a thousand years in the past.

859
00:42:09,375 --> 00:42:11,417
when it was lush and green and full of villages and things.

860
00:42:12,177 --> 00:42:14,639
And these beams, there's seven of them on the map,

861
00:42:14,920 --> 00:42:18,723
the player can position them in an entirely analog way.

862
00:42:19,464 --> 00:42:21,185
So you can push them around wherever you like,

863
00:42:21,606 --> 00:42:24,188
lay them across the map, then you go down onto the map,

864
00:42:24,308 --> 00:42:27,471
you walk, and you walk along, and if you cross the boundary,

865
00:42:27,611 --> 00:42:29,333
you change into the other period of time.

866
00:42:29,913 --> 00:42:31,515
So if you point your light at a village,

867
00:42:31,815 --> 00:42:33,096
you can go down and you can walk there.

868
00:42:34,285 --> 00:42:37,647
The narration of the game handles the boundary transition

869
00:42:38,007 --> 00:42:40,628
by looking at what kind of environment you were in before

870
00:42:40,768 --> 00:42:41,568
and where you are now.

871
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:43,189
So it might say something,

872
00:42:43,609 --> 00:42:45,369
if you are walking along the top of the map there,

873
00:42:45,690 --> 00:42:48,151
it might say the dusty plain sort of breaks

874
00:42:48,211 --> 00:42:49,471
with a few blades of grass,

875
00:42:49,511 --> 00:42:50,872
which push up between the stones

876
00:42:50,932 --> 00:42:54,033
and suddenly you're in a field of flowers in the sunshine.

877
00:42:54,493 --> 00:42:58,297
And you get this liminal transition, but that's basically procedurally generated.

878
00:42:58,397 --> 00:43:01,640
We can transition from any environment to any environment.

879
00:43:02,040 --> 00:43:05,844
And I wrote a transition for all of those, and I don't know if all of them are possible,

880
00:43:06,064 --> 00:43:08,867
because I didn't bother to check, because it was pointless to bother to check.

881
00:43:08,907 --> 00:43:12,190
It's an analog system. Maybe there's a time you can go from the forest to the marsh.

882
00:43:12,230 --> 00:43:15,413
Maybe there isn't. It took about 20 seconds to write. It doesn't matter.

883
00:43:17,303 --> 00:43:22,287
Strategically, that means that the player can do some quite cool things.

884
00:43:22,487 --> 00:43:25,029
They can say, that area of the map looks dangerous.

885
00:43:25,309 --> 00:43:28,391
I'll put a time beacon on top of it, and then I don't need to walk across it.

886
00:43:28,431 --> 00:43:29,472
I can use it as a bridge.

887
00:43:29,852 --> 00:43:32,935
We have several repair the bridge type puzzles as well.

888
00:43:34,016 --> 00:43:38,159
And if you shine it across the lake, the ferryman that I mentioned earlier,

889
00:43:38,319 --> 00:43:39,080
he's in the past.

890
00:43:39,740 --> 00:43:43,723
But if you go outside the beam of light, well, he's there 1,000 years in the past,

891
00:43:43,763 --> 00:43:45,945
and he vanishes, so you fall into the water.

892
00:43:46,834 --> 00:43:49,918
which is a great platform that the player set up for themselves.

893
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,301
I'm not sure that counts as strategy.

894
00:43:53,956 --> 00:43:56,237
In Sorcery 4, we implemented disguises.

895
00:43:56,317 --> 00:43:57,557
We had a small number of them.

896
00:43:57,677 --> 00:44:01,218
You can be a monk, a merchant, a guard, or a guard captain.

897
00:44:01,859 --> 00:44:04,279
We hid them in a couple of places,

898
00:44:04,840 --> 00:44:08,181
but we didn't really think too hard about where we put them.

899
00:44:08,961 --> 00:44:11,462
They change how all of the characters in the game

900
00:44:11,682 --> 00:44:12,262
relate to you.

901
00:44:12,722 --> 00:44:15,683
So merchants give better prices to other merchants.

902
00:44:16,163 --> 00:44:18,124
Guards will let guards into the guards hall.

903
00:44:18,444 --> 00:44:20,544
Everyone's scared of monks, that kind of thing.

904
00:44:22,112 --> 00:44:29,696
The game just copes with everything, and we didn't need then to balance or check the logic.

905
00:44:30,136 --> 00:44:34,438
And we put it out in the world, and players started to form strategies, optimisation strategies.

906
00:44:35,038 --> 00:44:38,500
They'd say, well I'll go over here and get the monk uniform, which lets me scare that guy,

907
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,982
but then I get this one and I change into a merchant, and I go over there and I buy the thing,

908
00:44:42,002 --> 00:44:44,843
and then I go back here and I get the guard uniform, and then that gets me into the mess.

909
00:44:45,383 --> 00:44:47,884
And we'd go, knock yourselves out, fantastic, whatever.

910
00:44:48,284 --> 00:44:49,845
Is there a better strategy? I don't know.

911
00:44:50,385 --> 00:44:52,407
I designed this game, but I don't know. I don't care.

912
00:44:53,829 --> 00:44:57,412
It allows for interesting strategic thought in a narrative context.

913
00:44:58,012 --> 00:44:58,593
It's good enough for me.

914
00:45:01,336 --> 00:45:05,299
Which, if you think about it, leads on to the next unexpected benefit,

915
00:45:05,600 --> 00:45:07,321
which is emergent solutions.

916
00:45:07,561 --> 00:45:10,824
What I described with the disguises is just an emergent solution.

917
00:45:11,845 --> 00:45:14,007
We ended up with more of those than I would have liked.

918
00:45:16,249 --> 00:45:20,650
both in Sorcery 3. The first one was the no beacons all serpents run.

919
00:45:21,010 --> 00:45:25,711
So it's really important for the narrative that the player uses these time beacons

920
00:45:25,891 --> 00:45:28,972
because it turns out that they have a cost but you don't know it at the time.

921
00:45:29,872 --> 00:45:33,073
But some players managed to get all the way across the map without using them

922
00:45:33,573 --> 00:45:35,634
and killing all the seven serpents along the way.

923
00:45:35,934 --> 00:45:37,114
We didn't think it was possible.

924
00:45:39,289 --> 00:45:40,650
I've never even done it myself.

925
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:45,696
We had to patch in a new ending to cover it and then sort of give those people a reward

926
00:45:45,877 --> 00:45:46,597
into book four.

927
00:45:47,058 --> 00:45:48,720
But those players weren't done.

928
00:45:48,740 --> 00:45:51,643
They then found Ebran, the god of gods.

929
00:45:52,024 --> 00:45:54,407
So in sorcery you can have a god.

930
00:45:54,587 --> 00:45:56,229
The gods are a bit weird.

931
00:45:56,349 --> 00:45:59,092
They tend to commentate slightly on what you do.

932
00:45:59,953 --> 00:46:04,375
We put in Ibran simply as a joke about Brian Henderson from Curiosity.

933
00:46:04,615 --> 00:46:08,657
He was supposed to turn up, moan about the fact that he had no power over anything at all,

934
00:46:08,797 --> 00:46:11,018
and then go away, get on with his life.

935
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:16,641
And he was supposed to disappear, but some players got Ibran,

936
00:46:16,941 --> 00:46:20,243
managed to get to the end of the game before he left, and had him in Book 4.

937
00:46:21,477 --> 00:46:23,978
which I didn't even know until we'd written most of book four

938
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:27,741
and then one of the beta testers quietly asked about it and I thought, oh no.

939
00:46:28,882 --> 00:46:33,165
So we added Ibran as a proper companion character who unlocks some special,

940
00:46:33,185 --> 00:46:36,908
some particularly fun easter egg special content towards the end of the game.

941
00:46:36,928 --> 00:46:40,310
So, costs.

942
00:46:43,161 --> 00:46:46,063
We've got this wonderful new system for building open world games.

943
00:46:46,103 --> 00:46:50,185
We're going to revolutionize narrative in a fully authored yet procedural way.

944
00:46:50,205 --> 00:46:51,826
The future is our oyster.

945
00:46:51,886 --> 00:46:52,607
Bob's your uncle.

946
00:46:52,627 --> 00:46:54,468
What are the problems?

947
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:56,709
Firstly.

948
00:46:58,860 --> 00:47:02,160
Okay, it's a benefit in disguise, but unpredictability.

949
00:47:02,380 --> 00:47:06,221
You really don't know what the player has done at any point.

950
00:47:06,301 --> 00:47:07,121
You can't know.

951
00:47:07,321 --> 00:47:09,042
You can't really guarantee anything.

952
00:47:09,482 --> 00:47:13,923
For example, do players know enough of the plot?

953
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:18,624
In 80 days, do you know why you're going around the world

954
00:47:18,724 --> 00:47:19,604
with Velia's fog?

955
00:47:19,864 --> 00:47:23,085
It is possible to get through the entire of 80 days

956
00:47:23,445 --> 00:47:26,005
and never be told why you're doing this.

957
00:47:27,484 --> 00:47:29,305
And I must admit, I break my own rules here.

958
00:47:29,385 --> 00:47:33,307
About halfway through, we just stop testing this flag

959
00:47:33,367 --> 00:47:34,747
because I'm sick of dealing with it.

960
00:47:35,287 --> 00:47:37,028
And about halfway through, it's assumed

961
00:47:37,088 --> 00:47:39,749
that Fogg might have just mentioned it idly off-camera

962
00:47:39,889 --> 00:47:40,650
to Passepartout.

963
00:47:41,630 --> 00:47:43,111
Because, of course, players know why

964
00:47:43,131 --> 00:47:45,612
they're going around the world, even if Fogg hasn't explicitly

965
00:47:45,652 --> 00:47:45,972
told them.

966
00:47:46,252 --> 00:47:47,852
But there is a nice kind of point in Venice

967
00:47:47,873 --> 00:47:49,633
when Passepartout can still be bumbling around

968
00:47:49,693 --> 00:47:51,494
in the state of some confusion, thinking

969
00:47:51,534 --> 00:47:53,895
his master might actually be a spy or a drug dealer

970
00:47:53,975 --> 00:47:54,375
or something.

971
00:47:56,503 --> 00:47:57,304
You can get around that.

972
00:47:58,185 --> 00:48:01,530
You can, of course, still use bottlenecks in your map.

973
00:48:02,151 --> 00:48:03,193
80 days doesn't have any.

974
00:48:03,814 --> 00:48:07,139
Sorcery 4 has quite a lot more plot points we want to hit.

975
00:48:07,299 --> 00:48:08,461
So we did use bottlenecks.

976
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:11,305
A nice trick is often to use

977
00:48:12,976 --> 00:48:14,236
like pairs of bottlenecks.

978
00:48:14,496 --> 00:48:17,437
So in Sorcery 4, when you go into the citadel,

979
00:48:17,477 --> 00:48:19,818
there are two doors, and then to the inner citadel,

980
00:48:19,838 --> 00:48:22,258
there are three ways in, and then to the higher encampment,

981
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:23,418
there are two ways of doing that.

982
00:48:23,918 --> 00:48:26,599
So there's still choice, there's still variation,

983
00:48:26,799 --> 00:48:29,320
there's still strategy, and then you just trap

984
00:48:29,640 --> 00:48:31,780
both of those bottlenecks with whatever it is

985
00:48:32,320 --> 00:48:33,121
you want the player to know.

986
00:48:33,561 --> 00:48:36,501
So when you get into the citadel in Sorcery 4,

987
00:48:36,541 --> 00:48:38,082
there's this crazy old beggar

988
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,142
who catches you for plot reasons.

989
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:44,464
That's sort of a running joke, there's always a crazy old beggar in sorcery all the time.

990
00:48:46,405 --> 00:48:51,208
And so he will catch you, whatever you do, although again, towards the end of development

991
00:48:51,288 --> 00:48:55,950
we found that if you get stung by bees and rescued by monks, you can dodge the crazy

992
00:48:55,990 --> 00:48:58,111
old beggar, so we added that as a plot thread as well.

993
00:48:58,351 --> 00:49:02,013
So you can actually complete the game without a crazy old beggar, which is kind of a feature

994
00:49:02,393 --> 00:49:05,595
for a sorcery game, but not very many people found it.

995
00:49:05,615 --> 00:49:06,295
It's just fun.

996
00:49:07,987 --> 00:49:12,868
In general, the major encounters can still be forced to happen,

997
00:49:13,289 --> 00:49:17,049
but interestingly, often with varying causes.

998
00:49:17,810 --> 00:49:19,370
So players might say, well, this thing happened,

999
00:49:19,390 --> 00:49:20,790
but it happened for a different reason.

1000
00:49:21,551 --> 00:49:23,931
To me, that's quite exciting.

1001
00:49:24,091 --> 00:49:25,731
That's quite interesting as a direction.

1002
00:49:25,751 --> 00:49:29,412
And it's very different than what the Witcher is doing, right?

1003
00:49:29,492 --> 00:49:32,153
The Witcher has the same cause, but you often choose the ending.

1004
00:49:32,893 --> 00:49:33,973
So this is kind of the other way up.

1005
00:49:35,519 --> 00:49:38,687
The second big cost, and if you're working in any kind of big studio,

1006
00:49:38,787 --> 00:49:41,754
this is almost certainly the most significant cost to you,

1007
00:49:42,836 --> 00:49:43,578
is redundancy.

1008
00:49:44,949 --> 00:49:47,730
You just have to accept this if you're going to go down this kind of design.

1009
00:49:48,551 --> 00:49:54,615
Almost all of the content you make will go unseen by any given player.

1010
00:49:55,455 --> 00:50:01,739
Someone who plays 80 days once will see about 3% of the game's text and not see any of the

1011
00:50:01,779 --> 00:50:02,219
rest of it.

1012
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:04,881
And if that hurts you inside, go write a Twine game.

1013
00:50:06,902 --> 00:50:07,222
Sorry.

1014
00:50:10,644 --> 00:50:14,045
But, all of your content will be seen by someone.

1015
00:50:14,706 --> 00:50:16,986
Even the most obscure content will be seen by someone.

1016
00:50:17,146 --> 00:50:20,208
Everything will be found by someone and that person will appreciate it.

1017
00:50:20,508 --> 00:50:23,449
And the fact that there is content that people don't find

1018
00:50:23,589 --> 00:50:26,750
makes the content that they do find more precious to them

1019
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,410
because they know that it's special.

1020
00:50:28,891 --> 00:50:32,592
So again, I don't see this as a cost, but if...

1021
00:50:32,872 --> 00:50:36,573
Then again, I don't do voice recording for every line of dialogue in my game.

1022
00:50:36,733 --> 00:50:39,935
I don't do motion capture for every argument that people have.

1023
00:50:40,896 --> 00:50:44,862
For us, variant dialogue is very cheap, which is convenient.

1024
00:50:46,985 --> 00:50:51,512
And I don't know if you can read the tiny stripe in quiet, but I'll let you read that for yourselves.

1025
00:50:53,775 --> 00:50:54,537
Finally, bugs.

1026
00:50:55,850 --> 00:50:57,712
Obviously, there's no dodging it.

1027
00:50:58,533 --> 00:51:01,837
If you use this kind of system, you have more logic.

1028
00:51:01,977 --> 00:51:03,499
You will have more bugs.

1029
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:05,281
You'll have to find them.

1030
00:51:05,541 --> 00:51:07,964
They are harder to find because you can play in more ways.

1031
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:12,308
The flip side is they're actually a lot easier to fix.

1032
00:51:14,158 --> 00:51:16,559
Almost always, by the time you've found a bug,

1033
00:51:16,799 --> 00:51:18,699
it's completely obvious what the problem is.

1034
00:51:18,899 --> 00:51:21,760
You just forgot to put a precondition on an option.

1035
00:51:23,040 --> 00:51:24,661
99% of our bugs are someone says,

1036
00:51:25,321 --> 00:51:26,341
Flanker's just appeared.

1037
00:51:26,361 --> 00:51:28,481
I wasn't traveling with Flanker,

1038
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:29,482
but now I can talk to him.

1039
00:51:29,862 --> 00:51:31,482
Well, we drop in, we add a condition,

1040
00:51:31,702 --> 00:51:32,422
the problem goes away.

1041
00:51:34,243 --> 00:51:36,384
Not all bugs are like that, as it says.

1042
00:51:36,724 --> 00:51:40,467
Sorcery 3 we shipped with about 15 serious GameStopper

1043
00:51:40,627 --> 00:51:43,669
fatal bugs which destroyed people's adventures.

1044
00:51:44,369 --> 00:51:46,310
Luckily, Sorcery has a rewind mechanic,

1045
00:51:46,430 --> 00:51:49,792
so you can actually ship a patch, rewind back, and play on.

1046
00:51:50,072 --> 00:51:51,874
But not all problems get caught that way.

1047
00:51:53,854 --> 00:51:56,675
One of them was that the water serpent only appeared once.

1048
00:51:57,055 --> 00:52:01,517
There was a bug with the way that the bag of lake content was offering up encounters.

1049
00:52:01,937 --> 00:52:05,418
The water serpent wasn't revisitable, so various people saw it, ran away from it,

1050
00:52:05,978 --> 00:52:10,540
and then spent days and days and days and weeks of game time scouring the whole map

1051
00:52:10,680 --> 00:52:14,841
trying to find this serpent, which could never appear again.

1052
00:52:15,161 --> 00:52:16,841
And that's a bit awkward and a bit unfortunate.

1053
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:23,924
Good news is, for Sorcery 4, we got some more testers and we had fewer bugs, so that was nice.

1054
00:52:25,184 --> 00:52:29,005
And obscure bugs aren't really hit by that many players anyway.

1055
00:52:30,465 --> 00:52:35,627
So I think there's probably a trade-off there, but then again I don't have to answer to any shareholders

1056
00:52:36,207 --> 00:52:39,048
or, for the moment, to any external QA departments.

1057
00:52:40,854 --> 00:52:43,335
And that's it. I can't think of any other costs. I think it's great.

1058
00:52:44,095 --> 00:52:47,696
So for our next iteration at Inkle, we announced this the other day,

1059
00:52:47,756 --> 00:52:49,836
we're moving on to a game called Heaven's Vault.

1060
00:52:50,076 --> 00:52:52,637
It's a graphical game. It's an open world game.

1061
00:52:52,877 --> 00:52:57,098
It's not quite a Witcher game in that as you travel the open world,

1062
00:52:57,138 --> 00:52:59,918
you go down into locations, which are their own little hubs,

1063
00:52:59,938 --> 00:53:00,879
and then come back again.

1064
00:53:01,259 --> 00:53:05,000
So it's structured more like Mass Effect than like The Witcher.

1065
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,720
That solves a few problems.

1066
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,361
You can't be halfway through a scene and then just leg it out the door.

1067
00:53:11,061 --> 00:53:13,343
But you do have quite a lot of freedom to explore around.

1068
00:53:14,344 --> 00:53:16,866
The actual construction is a mixture of content

1069
00:53:16,886 --> 00:53:20,188
that you can only do once, and content

1070
00:53:20,208 --> 00:53:22,370
that you can do in any order, and places

1071
00:53:22,390 --> 00:53:24,432
that you can revisit that expand over time.

1072
00:53:24,972 --> 00:53:29,776
So hopefully, we don't have to do too much logic everywhere,

1073
00:53:30,196 --> 00:53:32,518
but we'll have a few places which are very, very clever

1074
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:34,339
and responsive, and then a few places which

1075
00:53:34,400 --> 00:53:35,560
are kind of set pieces.

1076
00:53:36,580 --> 00:53:41,886
We're doing it with graphics, not prose, which means procedural events like the sun serpent

1077
00:53:42,166 --> 00:53:48,052
orb example that I gave are basically impossible because we need to ensure that they fit with the

1078
00:53:48,092 --> 00:53:53,297
geometry and that's harder to ensure, but procedural dialogue is well in.

1079
00:53:54,370 --> 00:53:58,794
Our two sidekick characters have an enormous bag of things they can talk about.

1080
00:53:59,074 --> 00:54:01,776
They're all guarded by preconditions which say things like,

1081
00:54:01,996 --> 00:54:04,078
is this relevant to what you've been talking about before?

1082
00:54:04,198 --> 00:54:07,021
Is it something you saw recently? Is it something you're thinking about?

1083
00:54:07,241 --> 00:54:11,024
Whatever. And they'll drag up these conversations as you move around, go through them.

1084
00:54:12,245 --> 00:54:14,887
So we're using a lot of, again if you're ink users,

1085
00:54:14,907 --> 00:54:18,010
we're using a lot of threads to sort of pull in content from different places.

1086
00:54:19,475 --> 00:54:22,416
And finally, it's all about player knowledge.

1087
00:54:22,536 --> 00:54:24,116
The whole construction of the game,

1088
00:54:24,237 --> 00:54:25,697
the whole unlock tree of the game.

1089
00:54:25,777 --> 00:54:27,998
We don't really have an inventory.

1090
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:29,298
It's all, what do you know?

1091
00:54:29,959 --> 00:54:31,159
Where do you think you need to go?

1092
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,701
So there will be hundreds, thousands, I don't know,

1093
00:54:35,721 --> 00:54:38,362
paths through the game's various discoveries.

1094
00:54:38,762 --> 00:54:41,363
But I'm pretty confident that because we have

1095
00:54:41,423 --> 00:54:43,424
our high watermark knowledge system,

1096
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:48,286
that so long as everything you do pushes something forwards,

1097
00:54:49,106 --> 00:54:52,007
everyone will eventually reach the end that I need them to reach.

1098
00:54:52,487 --> 00:54:54,548
And hopefully I don't even need to worry about that too much.

1099
00:54:54,708 --> 00:54:57,249
I just need to make sure if there are any...

1100
00:54:57,670 --> 00:54:58,570
I ask this in every talk.

1101
00:54:58,610 --> 00:55:00,131
If there are any mathematicians in the audience,

1102
00:55:00,371 --> 00:55:02,131
it's basically an inductive structure.

1103
00:55:02,512 --> 00:55:04,953
So long as everywhere has the ability to add one,

1104
00:55:05,393 --> 00:55:07,434
you will eventually reach any number you need.

1105
00:55:07,514 --> 00:55:09,355
Well, in our case, as long as every scene

1106
00:55:09,415 --> 00:55:12,236
has the ability to push something along somehow,

1107
00:55:12,616 --> 00:55:14,917
you will eventually move forward and reach the end of the game.

1108
00:55:15,097 --> 00:55:16,818
You might go a long way, you might go a short way.

1109
00:55:17,298 --> 00:55:20,081
And as they say in film, we'll fix that in post.

1110
00:55:21,883 --> 00:55:22,945
And that's it.

1111
00:55:23,405 --> 00:55:24,827
Thank you very much for coming.

1112
00:55:24,887 --> 00:55:25,828
I really appreciate it.

1113
00:55:25,948 --> 00:55:28,171
I know I was up against Firewatch as well.

1114
00:55:29,052 --> 00:55:32,116
Thank you for listening, and we've probably got a couple of times for questions.

1115
00:55:32,336 --> 00:55:32,516
Cheers.

1116
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:43,180
Hey.

1117
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:44,160
Hi.

1118
00:55:44,180 --> 00:55:45,361
I can reach this.

1119
00:55:46,701 --> 00:55:53,204
With the stuff you're saying about bugs and hardly found paths and stuff, have you guys

1120
00:55:53,704 --> 00:55:56,505
looked into doing some kind of programmable...

1121
00:55:57,846 --> 00:56:01,189
algorithmic traversal of the thing so you can find the edge cases by just

1122
00:56:01,249 --> 00:56:03,570
like iterating through every single possible combination?

1123
00:56:03,650 --> 00:56:08,034
Sure, so the question is basically have we built what they call a pad basher like an automatic player?

1124
00:56:08,434 --> 00:56:12,937
Yeah so for Sourcery we didn't and I wish we had and mainly it was because

1125
00:56:12,997 --> 00:56:17,441
the code base was quite old and the map traversal was hard to automate and we

1126
00:56:17,481 --> 00:56:18,341
were up against deadlines.

1127
00:56:18,702 --> 00:56:20,383
We're doing a lot more of that for Heaven's Vault.

1128
00:56:21,184 --> 00:56:24,126
I already have in my prototype, one of the first things I built was something that just

1129
00:56:24,146 --> 00:56:25,067
bashes through content.

1130
00:56:25,988 --> 00:56:29,070
It's been invaluable in finding places where the flow dies.

1131
00:56:29,891 --> 00:56:32,754
What it can't find is places where the flow contradicts itself.

1132
00:56:33,634 --> 00:56:35,936
One of our biggest issues is always continuity errors.

1133
00:56:36,337 --> 00:56:37,398
So somebody will...

1134
00:56:37,998 --> 00:56:42,021
We've been showing a demo to the press in the last couple of days, and one of our wonderful

1135
00:56:42,061 --> 00:56:44,704
journalists walked up to the outside of a great, beautiful...

1136
00:56:46,360 --> 00:56:49,260
and she pressed the conversation button and our archaeologist said,

1137
00:56:49,560 --> 00:56:51,381
I think the tomb is buried underground.

1138
00:56:52,141 --> 00:56:52,741
That kind of thing.

1139
00:56:53,001 --> 00:56:54,362
And a pad basher can't catch that.

1140
00:56:55,462 --> 00:56:58,102
But any automation you can do is obviously helpful.

1141
00:56:58,142 --> 00:57:00,343
So yeah, we are definitely interested in that.

1142
00:57:01,103 --> 00:57:01,243
Hi.

1143
00:57:01,783 --> 00:57:02,103
Hi.

1144
00:57:02,363 --> 00:57:05,684
Does your system use probability at all?

1145
00:57:05,944 --> 00:57:08,825
Like you'd go to a place and you have like a 90% chance

1146
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:12,926
you'd get this state and a 10% chance you'd get some other state?

1147
00:57:13,482 --> 00:57:17,984
Right, so the question is do we use probability in our designs, like that classic D&D role for whatever.

1148
00:57:18,484 --> 00:57:23,546
Actually, we don't, and that's kind of stylistic, I think.

1149
00:57:24,826 --> 00:57:30,368
I guess I always feel as a writer that at any given moment when the player makes any kind of choice,

1150
00:57:31,128 --> 00:57:35,509
I know what I think the best thing to happen at this point is, and I'm more interested in that,

1151
00:57:35,549 --> 00:57:41,171
and I think my audience is more interested in that, than one option which is okay and one option which is less fun.

1152
00:57:42,032 --> 00:57:45,835
So I would always rather make sure that every action has a good response,

1153
00:57:46,355 --> 00:57:50,358
rather than try to come up with multiple responses, all of which are kind of okay.

1154
00:57:50,699 --> 00:57:52,820
I understand the attraction of probabilistic games,

1155
00:57:53,141 --> 00:57:57,404
but I think they're probably better suited to things with repetitive,

1156
00:57:57,584 --> 00:58:00,507
or generic, or repurposable content,

1157
00:58:01,047 --> 00:58:04,430
rather than things where I have specific encounters that I wish to give you.

1158
00:58:05,431 --> 00:58:10,075
So our equivalent of it is really that when you say something to someone and it says,

1159
00:58:10,295 --> 00:58:12,557
do you know this fact? If so, talk about this.

1160
00:58:12,837 --> 00:58:14,338
Do you know this fact if you talk about this?

1161
00:58:14,698 --> 00:58:19,623
Because although that's totally deterministic, in practice it's random

1162
00:58:19,943 --> 00:58:24,086
because I have no idea how many players will know, be in this state,

1163
00:58:24,106 --> 00:58:26,649
how many players will be in that state, how many players will see this stuff.

1164
00:58:27,149 --> 00:58:29,031
So that's our take on it.

1165
00:58:31,026 --> 00:58:37,473
Probability, doing probability just feels like you need to write more for no actual extra gain, but whatever your view may differ

1166
00:58:37,493 --> 00:58:40,416
Thank you. It's probably time
