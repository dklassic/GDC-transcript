1
00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:06,325
Good morning.

2
00:00:07,326 --> 00:00:08,067
Thanks for being here.

3
00:00:08,087 --> 00:00:10,729
I know it's pretty early, especially

4
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:12,811
for the third day of GDC.

5
00:00:15,453 --> 00:00:15,993
Shall we start?

6
00:00:16,874 --> 00:00:20,597
I have a lot to say, so I'd rather start quite right away.

7
00:00:22,018 --> 00:00:25,641
To tell you more about the last decade, actually, it's insane.

8
00:00:25,661 --> 00:00:28,864
We were just discussing in the back about how time flies.

9
00:00:30,675 --> 00:00:34,658
And a lot of things happened since 2007 with the release

10
00:00:35,338 --> 00:00:36,279
of Assassin's Creed 1.

11
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:40,942
Just to start, because I'm not a very public person

12
00:00:41,022 --> 00:00:43,424
and not a very vocal person, just

13
00:00:43,444 --> 00:00:45,225
start by introducing myself a bit.

14
00:00:46,025 --> 00:00:48,347
I define myself as a designer that

15
00:00:48,387 --> 00:00:49,588
works in creative industries.

16
00:00:49,728 --> 00:00:51,549
And I had a first career making toys.

17
00:00:52,029 --> 00:00:54,971
So if you'd like to discuss about development

18
00:00:55,071 --> 00:00:57,493
of construction toys, I'd be more happy to discuss that.

19
00:00:57,513 --> 00:00:58,493
But I guess you're more here.

20
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:02,932
today to learn about my experience at Ubisoft,

21
00:01:02,972 --> 00:01:04,934
mostly on the Assassin's Creed brand,

22
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,536
that I joined back in 2006

23
00:01:08,496 --> 00:01:10,178
for the last year of production of AC1,

24
00:01:11,138 --> 00:01:13,340
then moving as a game designer on AC2.

25
00:01:14,881 --> 00:01:17,684
Then for two years, I worked more at the brand level,

26
00:01:17,964 --> 00:01:19,825
overseeing a bit the entire universe.

27
00:01:20,406 --> 00:01:22,327
And I came back to the production level

28
00:01:22,347 --> 00:01:23,288
as a creative director,

29
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:25,790
where I had the honor and privilege

30
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:27,952
to direct Black Flag and Origin.

31
00:01:29,127 --> 00:01:34,251
So yeah, and this was my personal achievement,

32
00:01:34,652 --> 00:01:36,353
where my two carriers kind of collided.

33
00:01:37,314 --> 00:01:39,395
That was very nice.

34
00:01:39,455 --> 00:01:40,236
2014, New York Comic Con.

35
00:01:40,797 --> 00:01:43,379
Okay, but so let's start right away to talk about

36
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,840
the 10 years of Assassin's Creed,

37
00:01:46,341 --> 00:01:47,922
and what I propose you today,

38
00:01:47,982 --> 00:01:50,004
just to start with a quick video,

39
00:01:50,144 --> 00:01:53,326
just to immerse ourselves a bit into the franchise.

40
00:03:09,929 --> 00:03:13,591
So yes, 10 years between basically this AC1 hoodie

41
00:03:13,651 --> 00:03:15,572
and this Origins t-shirt.

42
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:19,475
And so the question is, how did we move from one game,

43
00:03:19,895 --> 00:03:24,217
actually a sole game, in 2007 to this massive global franchise

44
00:03:26,179 --> 00:03:26,839
of entertainment?

45
00:03:27,659 --> 00:03:30,001
I will structure this talk into three big phases.

46
00:03:30,861 --> 00:03:32,662
One about the creation of the franchise

47
00:03:32,722 --> 00:03:36,505
and finding really the recipe and our own identity.

48
00:03:37,085 --> 00:03:39,566
expanding it and finally refreshing it

49
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:41,888
with a deeper focus on origins.

50
00:03:42,448 --> 00:03:45,530
And so if you're ready to enter the vault of Assassin's Creed,

51
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:48,111
to enter the Animus, to deep dive into it,

52
00:03:48,191 --> 00:03:50,153
be ready because there will be a lot of things.

53
00:03:50,673 --> 00:03:53,234
And so maybe I will talk fast.

54
00:03:53,915 --> 00:03:55,596
I hope you will follow me on that.

55
00:03:55,696 --> 00:03:59,159
So let's start with the creation of Assassin's Creed.

56
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,043
And I will talk about both Assassin's Creed I

57
00:04:03,183 --> 00:04:04,204
and Assassin's Creed II.

58
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:06,326
Actually, the story starts back in 2004.

59
00:04:07,026 --> 00:04:08,868
Because as you may know already,

60
00:04:09,228 --> 00:04:11,590
the team behind Prince of Persia Sands of Time

61
00:04:11,931 --> 00:04:13,852
got the mandate to prepare for the next gen.

62
00:04:14,133 --> 00:04:16,895
And if you remember, for the oldest of you,

63
00:04:17,375 --> 00:04:19,277
next gen back in the time was Xbox 360 and PS3.

64
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:24,701
and to also reinvent the action-adventure genre.

65
00:04:25,361 --> 00:04:27,742
And so this is really this pop next gen

66
00:04:28,182 --> 00:04:30,023
that slowly but surely morphed

67
00:04:30,564 --> 00:04:32,905
into what became Assassin's Creed.

68
00:04:33,645 --> 00:04:34,906
And with Assassin's Creed,

69
00:04:34,986 --> 00:04:37,867
when the decision was made to create this new IP,

70
00:04:38,448 --> 00:04:41,009
the idea was really to bring a more mature take,

71
00:04:41,629 --> 00:04:44,131
to come up with something

72
00:04:44,171 --> 00:04:45,971
that was really conveying the next gen.

73
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,524
And here, I stop for just for a moment.

74
00:04:49,544 --> 00:04:50,945
This is the tutorial slide.

75
00:04:52,286 --> 00:04:53,886
So when you will see slides like that,

76
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:57,248
these are actual PowerPoint slides from the dates

77
00:04:57,328 --> 00:04:57,989
that you see here.

78
00:04:58,149 --> 00:05:00,710
So this is a slide from a PowerPoint back of 2006.

79
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,791
And you will see quite a lot of them.

80
00:05:03,332 --> 00:05:07,934
And so the idea was really to bring modernity, next gen,

81
00:05:07,974 --> 00:05:10,736
have something really unique and really refreshing.

82
00:05:11,396 --> 00:05:14,898
And yes, the game was set during the Middle Age,

83
00:05:15,138 --> 00:05:16,819
but not this kind of Middle Age.

84
00:05:17,339 --> 00:05:22,080
We didn't want the franchise, supposed to be a next-gen hit,

85
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:26,961
to have this kind of treatment, very medieval,

86
00:05:27,482 --> 00:05:29,842
and so this is why some decisions were made.

87
00:05:30,542 --> 00:05:34,023
One important one was actually to have a more realistic treatment

88
00:05:34,263 --> 00:05:35,964
and to accept the M rating.

89
00:05:36,404 --> 00:05:37,704
That was not the case for POP.

90
00:05:38,024 --> 00:05:40,765
And this was a big step forward also.

91
00:05:41,785 --> 00:05:44,926
And with this realistic treatment came the present day.

92
00:05:45,606 --> 00:05:49,609
The reason behind the present day in the first place is really to create relatedness

93
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,134
between the audience and the setting. Once again, yes, the game was set during the Third Crusade

94
00:05:55,794 --> 00:06:01,579
in the Middle Ages, but we wanted the overall game and the overall experience to feel

95
00:06:01,899 --> 00:06:08,124
really modern. And so with the DNA, with the animus, this was really edgy and allowing the game

96
00:06:08,544 --> 00:06:13,048
to be at the forefront of this new generation of games.

97
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:17,131
It also came with some very strong iconic elements.

98
00:06:17,671 --> 00:06:19,911
The crest that evolved through times,

99
00:06:20,111 --> 00:06:24,632
but still remain one of the key piece of the franchise.

100
00:06:25,073 --> 00:06:28,714
A clear reference coming from the eagle, the bird of prey,

101
00:06:28,774 --> 00:06:31,774
not only about the silhouette of the hood with the beak hood,

102
00:06:32,014 --> 00:06:33,675
but also even the posing of Altair.

103
00:06:33,695 --> 00:06:36,095
And this notion of the assassin is really

104
00:06:36,115 --> 00:06:37,356
dominating the situation.

105
00:06:37,376 --> 00:06:40,497
He's overlooking the world from above,

106
00:06:40,577 --> 00:06:42,357
ready to strike whenever he wants.

107
00:06:43,577 --> 00:06:46,698
The game was also coming with the Hidden Blade, a very unique weapon.

108
00:06:47,138 --> 00:06:49,539
No other games had the same type of things.

109
00:06:49,979 --> 00:06:52,960
Very well suited for the fantasy of an assassin.

110
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:55,901
And I mentioned it already, the Animus technology

111
00:06:56,241 --> 00:07:00,863
that would allow us to link it to our 21st century audience.

112
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,545
And so this was more about the treatment

113
00:07:03,825 --> 00:07:07,089
and the idea behind the rational of certain elements.

114
00:07:07,429 --> 00:07:09,812
But in terms of gameplay, it was really also entering

115
00:07:09,852 --> 00:07:10,893
the open world genre.

116
00:07:11,414 --> 00:07:15,659
Moving from a very linear, hardly level design platformer.

117
00:07:16,347 --> 00:07:22,109
to an open world game where actually these acrobatics with the parkour could be done

118
00:07:22,129 --> 00:07:30,312
and enjoyed everywhere in the city. And this was a big big step for the team. This was huge and this

119
00:07:30,552 --> 00:07:35,194
required actually new tech and this is why we developed the Envil engine.

120
00:07:35,954 --> 00:07:39,556
in order to be able to render these fully interactive cities

121
00:07:41,116 --> 00:07:43,457
that you could interact with in many, many different ways.

122
00:07:44,038 --> 00:07:45,998
All buildings were climbable, as you know.

123
00:07:46,579 --> 00:07:49,040
It was also pushing the photorealistic treatment

124
00:07:49,260 --> 00:07:50,981
about characters, mostly in cinematic,

125
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:57,743
and also the possibility to manage big crowds.

126
00:07:58,536 --> 00:08:02,639
If you remember 10 years ago, having more than 100 NPCs

127
00:08:02,939 --> 00:08:05,161
walking in the streets, that was big.

128
00:08:05,301 --> 00:08:07,923
And this was also linked to the core gameplays.

129
00:08:08,363 --> 00:08:11,125
But the thing is, and this is probably the first lesson,

130
00:08:11,405 --> 00:08:13,947
when you develop the engine at the same time

131
00:08:13,987 --> 00:08:16,789
that you develop the content, well, there is a risk.

132
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:21,252
Builds are not stable enough, so you cannot develop properly

133
00:08:22,013 --> 00:08:23,854
gameplays and the full experience.

134
00:08:23,894 --> 00:08:25,856
So when the game hit the shelves.

135
00:08:27,325 --> 00:08:32,131
We had very good things, you know, we were the fastest selling new IP.

136
00:08:33,052 --> 00:08:36,476
So with excellent sales, the narrative really caught people,

137
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:39,580
the Assassin fantasy, the world, the parkour, all this was good.

138
00:08:40,161 --> 00:08:44,245
But at the same time we had mixed reviews because we were lacking of things to do.

139
00:08:45,312 --> 00:08:47,514
And there was too much repetitivity.

140
00:08:47,614 --> 00:08:52,237
Some of the journalists even said, is it just a tech demo?

141
00:08:52,617 --> 00:08:57,260
And this is why I've put Assassin's Creed 2 within the

142
00:08:57,320 --> 00:08:59,001
creation section.

143
00:08:59,461 --> 00:09:02,303
Because we really needed this game to deliver the full

144
00:09:02,343 --> 00:09:03,904
promise of what Assassin's Creed was.

145
00:09:04,705 --> 00:09:08,267
So 10 years ago, actually, when I joined AC2 as a game

146
00:09:08,287 --> 00:09:10,428
designer, the mandate was really, really clear.

147
00:09:11,048 --> 00:09:13,269
It was to repeat the commercial success of AC1,

148
00:09:13,909 --> 00:09:16,531
but this time fixing all the issues it had.

149
00:09:17,591 --> 00:09:20,713
So that sounds easy, but it was quite a big challenge.

150
00:09:21,233 --> 00:09:24,175
And so what we started to do, and remember,

151
00:09:24,235 --> 00:09:25,155
these slides are from 2008.

152
00:09:27,492 --> 00:09:32,917
We analyzed thoroughly AC1, doing a post-mortem,

153
00:09:33,638 --> 00:09:36,721
looking at what people were asked to do in the game

154
00:09:36,741 --> 00:09:37,902
in terms of mission, et cetera.

155
00:09:38,002 --> 00:09:43,547
And what we realized was that actual missions of Assassin's

156
00:09:43,567 --> 00:09:46,850
Creed 1 were not asking players to do what they

157
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,011
were enjoying on their own.

158
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:53,731
So we were asking you to sit on a bench to pickpocket guys.

159
00:09:53,831 --> 00:09:55,132
Actually, when you were playing alone,

160
00:09:55,192 --> 00:09:58,212
you just like to parkour, to fight, or to blend.

161
00:09:58,832 --> 00:10:01,513
And so this was the first learning

162
00:10:02,053 --> 00:10:04,274
that helped shape Assassin's Creed 2.

163
00:10:04,594 --> 00:10:07,814
We identified our three main gameplay pillars.

164
00:10:08,494 --> 00:10:11,655
So the fight, the navigation, and the social stealth.

165
00:10:12,135 --> 00:10:15,156
And the entire game was designed around these pillars.

166
00:10:15,870 --> 00:10:18,591
So if you take the enemies, the archetypes of soldiers,

167
00:10:18,671 --> 00:10:21,151
they were challenging these three pillars.

168
00:10:21,471 --> 00:10:23,892
The three factions that you have to work with,

169
00:10:23,932 --> 00:10:25,753
that Ezio has to work with, the same,

170
00:10:26,253 --> 00:10:27,713
but supporting you on that.

171
00:10:28,053 --> 00:10:30,474
Even the type of side missions were based on that,

172
00:10:31,034 --> 00:10:34,095
so that we could actually enjoy them and support them fully.

173
00:10:34,695 --> 00:10:36,416
And so in the end, all the design loops

174
00:10:37,016 --> 00:10:41,697
were focused on actually supporting and making players

175
00:10:42,018 --> 00:10:44,878
use these pillars that were the most, the more important.

176
00:10:45,625 --> 00:10:51,390
So that was the gameplay recipe that we came up with for EC2.

177
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,932
At the same time, it was also clear for us

178
00:10:54,032 --> 00:10:56,855
that the franchise was about history,

179
00:10:57,375 --> 00:11:00,078
was about making history everyone's playground.

180
00:11:00,398 --> 00:11:03,521
And from day one, we started to work with historians

181
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:08,005
to make people immersed into living a time period.

182
00:11:08,365 --> 00:11:09,726
And so when talking about history,

183
00:11:10,407 --> 00:11:14,649
It's not about that, you know, a very old engraving of a very old man.

184
00:11:14,729 --> 00:11:19,492
The Leonardo da Vinci that you meet in the game, as you probably know, is this young,

185
00:11:19,532 --> 00:11:21,493
you know, petulant and very dynamic man.

186
00:11:22,074 --> 00:11:29,318
And with things like that, we were giving players the joy, basically the excitement

187
00:11:29,378 --> 00:11:31,099
to live history, to be part of it.

188
00:11:32,585 --> 00:11:35,966
And so while history was really the core of the experience,

189
00:11:36,807 --> 00:11:40,228
Assassin's Creed II helped us also solidify

190
00:11:40,248 --> 00:11:41,289
the rest of the narrative.

191
00:11:41,989 --> 00:11:43,390
And this wonderful onion.

192
00:11:44,390 --> 00:11:46,972
is here to show you that we kind of theorized

193
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:48,853
the structure of our universe

194
00:11:49,474 --> 00:11:51,816
with what we called the Onion Structure,

195
00:11:52,276 --> 00:11:54,878
where it's clear that there is the video game layer,

196
00:11:55,318 --> 00:11:56,599
there is the present day layer,

197
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,861
and in the present day, you enter the Animus,

198
00:11:58,901 --> 00:12:02,344
and in the Animus, you access the genetic memories

199
00:12:02,384 --> 00:12:04,385
in the past, and this is very important

200
00:12:04,425 --> 00:12:06,647
because this is solidifying everything

201
00:12:06,687 --> 00:12:08,889
within the Assassin's Creed universe.

202
00:12:09,784 --> 00:12:13,006
And so once that was solidified, we could expand

203
00:12:13,386 --> 00:12:18,090
on Desmond's story on one side, but also diving deeper

204
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:21,032
on the mysteries with subject 16 and the puzzles

205
00:12:21,512 --> 00:12:24,695
that was actually linking it to the first civilization.

206
00:12:25,715 --> 00:12:28,978
So around the historical period, we were developing

207
00:12:28,998 --> 00:12:31,019
the present day and the first civil war.

208
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,081
And this was pushing all together

209
00:12:33,441 --> 00:12:34,742
for a very strong narrative.

210
00:12:36,588 --> 00:12:39,330
This was mostly for the content, but we had only two years

211
00:12:39,410 --> 00:12:40,751
to deliver AC2.

212
00:12:40,811 --> 00:12:44,653
And so we also needed to nail the production pipeline.

213
00:12:45,394 --> 00:12:47,495
And with Assassin's Creed 2, we came up

214
00:12:47,555 --> 00:12:50,737
with some very strong design documentation,

215
00:12:50,817 --> 00:12:53,458
from the creative briefs to the FSO.

216
00:12:53,898 --> 00:12:56,500
Actually, Patrick Plourde made a talk here at GDC

217
00:12:56,540 --> 00:12:57,621
a few years ago about that.

218
00:12:58,221 --> 00:13:00,362
And also, during the end of production,

219
00:13:00,422 --> 00:13:04,344
the extensive use of playtests to secure quality of the game.

220
00:13:04,965 --> 00:13:08,706
And so this helped us also really solidify

221
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:11,127
the way we were producing, we were developing

222
00:13:11,147 --> 00:13:12,608
Assassin's Creed.

223
00:13:13,968 --> 00:13:16,549
But back in 2008, also if you remember,

224
00:13:16,649 --> 00:13:18,710
there was a big game being released,

225
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,611
spring 2008, GTA IV hit the shelves.

226
00:13:23,272 --> 00:13:26,093
And so our top management actually required us

227
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,233
to beef up the game.

228
00:13:28,097 --> 00:13:31,500
to increase the scope, but giving us the means to do so.

229
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,641
And this was the first time we had

230
00:13:33,742 --> 00:13:35,283
multiple teams collaborating.

231
00:13:35,783 --> 00:13:41,487
So we worked with ANSI in France that was developing

232
00:13:41,648 --> 00:13:45,951
all the villa development, the villa management side.

233
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:48,513
The newborn Singapore studio that

234
00:13:48,553 --> 00:13:51,495
helped us bringing all the secret locations,

235
00:13:51,575 --> 00:13:52,556
focusing on parkour.

236
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:56,197
And we even created a second team in Montreal

237
00:13:56,877 --> 00:14:00,139
in charge of bringing some more exotic moments to spice up

238
00:14:00,640 --> 00:14:01,680
the overall experience.

239
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:04,322
So think about the flying machine sequence

240
00:14:04,782 --> 00:14:07,184
or the carriage chase in the mountain.

241
00:14:07,924 --> 00:14:08,584
And so end of 2009.

242
00:14:11,581 --> 00:14:13,781
Yes, champagne, we could celebrate.

243
00:14:14,142 --> 00:14:16,182
We managed to deliver this big game,

244
00:14:16,202 --> 00:14:19,303
a quality game with a strong narrative,

245
00:14:19,363 --> 00:14:20,743
with a lot of things to do,

246
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:23,944
with very well integrated systems,

247
00:14:24,044 --> 00:14:25,424
wonderful world to explore.

248
00:14:25,864 --> 00:14:29,245
And so we really had this certitude,

249
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:31,045
this certainty at this moment

250
00:14:31,466 --> 00:14:33,466
that we knew what Assassin's Creed was.

251
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:36,567
And so it was now time to move on

252
00:14:37,187 --> 00:14:39,567
and start the expansion of it, right?

253
00:14:39,627 --> 00:14:40,248
So let's see.

254
00:14:41,163 --> 00:14:42,824
what the expanding phase is about.

255
00:14:46,487 --> 00:14:49,369
The first thing that allowed us to expand the franchise

256
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:51,631
was the creation of a brand team.

257
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:55,054
So around Sebastien Puel, who was the executive producer,

258
00:14:55,875 --> 00:14:58,157
we were a little group of people around.

259
00:14:58,577 --> 00:15:01,980
And so I was lucky enough to be part of this content team,

260
00:15:03,141 --> 00:15:06,944
working on all aspects, basically, to secure our

261
00:15:06,964 --> 00:15:09,446
mandates, was to secure yearly releases.

262
00:15:10,447 --> 00:15:12,690
and also develop the franchise awareness

263
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:16,074
to really make Assassin's Creed something important.

264
00:15:16,835 --> 00:15:19,017
So if we talk about the yearly releases,

265
00:15:20,119 --> 00:15:24,023
it only could be done working with multiple core teams.

266
00:15:24,364 --> 00:15:26,326
I'm not talking about multiple teams

267
00:15:26,386 --> 00:15:27,708
collaborating on one game.

268
00:15:28,692 --> 00:15:29,933
This was a brand new thing.

269
00:15:30,553 --> 00:15:31,073
It was big.

270
00:15:31,133 --> 00:15:33,954
It was actually having multiple core teams working in parallel.

271
00:15:34,314 --> 00:15:36,594
So if you look at the first core team, the original one,

272
00:15:37,255 --> 00:15:40,236
that made AC1, that was behind AC2 also.

273
00:15:40,896 --> 00:15:43,637
In 2010, with the creation of this team,

274
00:15:44,517 --> 00:15:47,778
and so yes, Singapore already helping us during AC2.

275
00:15:50,293 --> 00:15:53,015
2010, while the first core team was actually producing

276
00:15:53,055 --> 00:15:56,678
and developing Brotherhood, a second core team in Montreal

277
00:15:56,738 --> 00:16:00,000
started to work on Assassin's Creed 3 in parallel.

278
00:16:00,501 --> 00:16:04,003
The year after, while the first core team was moving on Unity,

279
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,546
a third core team in Montreal was

280
00:16:07,606 --> 00:16:09,227
created to deliver Revelations.

281
00:16:10,096 --> 00:16:14,999
while the team of AC3 was continuing the thing, and so on.

282
00:16:15,379 --> 00:16:18,120
And so by adding people from different studios,

283
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:20,441
developing talents all around the world,

284
00:16:20,882 --> 00:16:23,083
we were able to actually bring the franchise

285
00:16:23,403 --> 00:16:26,324
with this cycle, and Origins really benefited from that

286
00:16:26,425 --> 00:16:30,787
with strong addition from people from Sofia and Singapore,

287
00:16:31,147 --> 00:16:32,808
and a lot of them, a lot more,

288
00:16:33,208 --> 00:16:35,749
but you will see that these two studios mostly.

289
00:16:36,630 --> 00:16:39,091
And so it was really during all this phase,

290
00:16:39,771 --> 00:16:45,993
it was moving from a collaboration organization

291
00:16:46,153 --> 00:16:47,834
to a co-development organization.

292
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:50,175
What I mean is that collaboration basically is that.

293
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:55,148
So you have the lead studio that is leading the overall experience, right?

294
00:16:55,529 --> 00:16:57,630
So let's take Black Flag, led in Montreal.

295
00:16:58,670 --> 00:17:02,232
And we give some mandates to other studios.

296
00:17:02,652 --> 00:17:04,754
For example, the underwater sequences.

297
00:17:05,834 --> 00:17:10,417
But the thing is, the way the game and the scope and the mandates were done,

298
00:17:10,437 --> 00:17:13,638
is that it was always feasible to re-scope.

299
00:17:14,998 --> 00:17:16,799
For example, if things turned bad,

300
00:17:17,239 --> 00:17:19,239
or didn't work as well as intended.

301
00:17:19,699 --> 00:17:21,400
So it wasn't the case with the underwater,

302
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:23,020
that's just for the sake of the example,

303
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:23,920
don't get me wrong.

304
00:17:24,600 --> 00:17:25,601
But this was the idea.

305
00:17:26,061 --> 00:17:29,401
And slowly but surely, developing the expertise

306
00:17:29,741 --> 00:17:32,102
in other studios, we came, for example,

307
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:35,103
this is Origins co-development structure,

308
00:17:35,543 --> 00:17:39,443
where you can see that without Sofia and Singapore,

309
00:17:40,563 --> 00:17:43,165
the world of Assassin's Creed Origins wouldn't be the same.

310
00:17:43,905 --> 00:17:47,227
They took big, big, massive chunks of the game,

311
00:17:47,487 --> 00:17:50,269
including the world, the quest, and major systems.

312
00:17:51,029 --> 00:17:56,593
And so this was done through this decade, basically.

313
00:17:57,213 --> 00:17:59,915
At the same time, while still working parallel

314
00:17:59,975 --> 00:18:03,177
and having to respect some elements

315
00:18:03,597 --> 00:18:05,919
to make sure that we were still developing the franchise,

316
00:18:06,079 --> 00:18:07,740
each game had the mandate to stay fresh.

317
00:18:08,481 --> 00:18:10,845
to bring something new to the franchise and to the gamers.

318
00:18:11,826 --> 00:18:13,810
So if you look back at Brotherhood,

319
00:18:13,830 --> 00:18:16,314
he came up with actually the Brotherhood,

320
00:18:16,334 --> 00:18:18,517
the Assassin Brotherhood that you could manage,

321
00:18:18,938 --> 00:18:22,023
and also the multiplayer developed by NC in France.

322
00:18:22,802 --> 00:18:27,645
With Revelations, the navigation was fastened with the use of the hook blade.

323
00:18:28,226 --> 00:18:30,507
So it was an interesting twist.

324
00:18:30,527 --> 00:18:34,529
And in the present day, we had this weird, animus limbo experience.

325
00:18:34,689 --> 00:18:35,530
That was something new.

326
00:18:36,831 --> 00:18:39,492
With AC3, Assassin's Creed 3 2012,

327
00:18:40,773 --> 00:18:44,275
that was the first time we had the chance to play in a nature environment.

328
00:18:44,695 --> 00:18:45,476
And this was big.

329
00:18:45,996 --> 00:18:49,578
How do you deal with trees, with cliffs, etc.

330
00:18:50,319 --> 00:18:51,159
And Singapore.

331
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:57,524
ramping up very strongly, bringing the naval missions

332
00:18:58,024 --> 00:19:01,006
that allowed us on Black Flag to bring

333
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:02,787
this seamless naval world.

334
00:19:03,668 --> 00:19:04,989
And at the same time in Black Flag,

335
00:19:05,029 --> 00:19:07,090
we were changing the formula for the present day,

336
00:19:07,110 --> 00:19:11,633
and I will get into more details about that soon.

337
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:13,175
Unity.

338
00:19:14,064 --> 00:19:20,889
A lot of work done to revamp the engine, actually, and also bringing the co-op and syndicate

339
00:19:21,309 --> 00:19:27,854
with this nice twist of having two main characters in the storyline, and also working and tweaking

340
00:19:28,094 --> 00:19:29,735
the gameplay features.

341
00:19:31,058 --> 00:19:34,659
So that was the way basically all teams work in parallel

342
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:37,560
while still having things and trying things.

343
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:40,960
Some of them lasted, for example, the navel.

344
00:19:41,341 --> 00:19:42,301
Some of them didn't.

345
00:19:42,881 --> 00:19:45,641
Think about the tower defense, Templar stuff in Revelations.

346
00:19:46,142 --> 00:19:48,862
But the idea was to try, to always try.

347
00:19:48,902 --> 00:19:50,742
Even if we knew the global structure,

348
00:19:51,223 --> 00:19:54,383
every single game brought something to the players

349
00:19:54,763 --> 00:19:55,483
and to the franchise.

350
00:19:57,161 --> 00:20:00,323
So the second pillars we had as a brand team

351
00:20:00,683 --> 00:20:02,665
was really to develop the franchise awareness

352
00:20:02,705 --> 00:20:05,967
and make AC very important into the video game industry,

353
00:20:07,047 --> 00:20:09,269
but even more, actually, in the entertainment industry

354
00:20:09,309 --> 00:20:09,729
in general.

355
00:20:12,631 --> 00:20:15,033
Because Assassin's Creed 2 started it.

356
00:20:16,373 --> 00:20:18,755
At the launch of AC2, you had Lineage.

357
00:20:18,955 --> 00:20:22,457
That was the first attempt of a live action movie.

358
00:20:22,898 --> 00:20:23,918
We had two other games.

359
00:20:24,439 --> 00:20:26,520
We had a novel and a French comic book.

360
00:20:27,383 --> 00:20:28,423
The results were mixed.

361
00:20:29,064 --> 00:20:31,925
We had good things, mostly because they were focusing on

362
00:20:31,985 --> 00:20:33,205
prequels and sequels.

363
00:20:35,006 --> 00:20:37,047
Renaissance was so-so.

364
00:20:37,107 --> 00:20:39,348
It was a good novel, but the thing, it wasn't bringing

365
00:20:39,508 --> 00:20:40,048
anything new.

366
00:20:40,568 --> 00:20:43,009
It was literally the novelization of the script of

367
00:20:43,049 --> 00:20:43,329
the game.

368
00:20:43,669 --> 00:20:44,570
So if you like the game.

369
00:20:45,626 --> 00:20:47,387
you would have read the exact same thing.

370
00:20:47,988 --> 00:20:50,530
And the French comic was exactly the thing

371
00:20:50,730 --> 00:20:51,531
that you want to avoid.

372
00:20:52,111 --> 00:20:55,314
Using the same characters, but in different stories,

373
00:20:55,714 --> 00:20:59,637
and breaking the cohesiveness of the universe.

374
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:02,500
This is why, back in 2010, for us,

375
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:06,343
it was clear that we needed to establish our vision

376
00:21:06,723 --> 00:21:08,525
when it comes to transmedia.

377
00:21:09,230 --> 00:21:10,651
And the fact, for example, that we

378
00:21:10,671 --> 00:21:13,833
wanted to enlarge our universe and making

379
00:21:14,073 --> 00:21:17,956
every single creation a good standalone that would

380
00:21:18,196 --> 00:21:20,118
add to the overall thing.

381
00:21:20,138 --> 00:21:21,839
You know, each product is a standalone,

382
00:21:21,899 --> 00:21:24,241
but the collection of them makes the IP bigger

383
00:21:24,821 --> 00:21:25,882
than the sum of its parts.

384
00:21:26,622 --> 00:21:29,044
And so this was really the vision back in 2010.

385
00:21:29,885 --> 00:21:32,647
And we knew that to do that and to expand it,

386
00:21:33,187 --> 00:21:35,029
we needed to work with other people.

387
00:21:35,549 --> 00:21:37,290
We couldn't do everything on our own.

388
00:21:37,947 --> 00:21:41,569
So we needed to be ready to share our vision of the franchise,

389
00:21:41,649 --> 00:21:44,131
to share what needed to be respected,

390
00:21:45,192 --> 00:21:49,195
so that other people, talented people in their own field of expertise,

391
00:21:49,455 --> 00:21:51,697
would actually bring very good content.

392
00:21:52,337 --> 00:21:54,719
And so this is why we had to clarify the fundamentals.

393
00:21:55,498 --> 00:21:59,840
So we developed Bibles with the cannots, can do, cannot do,

394
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:03,301
with the 10 commandments of the franchise.

395
00:22:03,801 --> 00:22:08,764
Once again, solidifying the theory of the universe,

396
00:22:08,884 --> 00:22:11,525
explaining the union structure, explaining the way

397
00:22:11,985 --> 00:22:14,226
genetic memories were transmitted.

398
00:22:14,306 --> 00:22:16,967
There are things that can be done within the animus.

399
00:22:17,307 --> 00:22:19,988
There are things that cannot be done, et cetera.

400
00:22:20,529 --> 00:22:23,110
And this was really important to have other people really

401
00:22:23,150 --> 00:22:23,930
understand what AC is.

402
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:30,296
so that they would not dilute our universe.

403
00:22:31,177 --> 00:22:32,758
At the same time, we're developing tools

404
00:22:32,778 --> 00:22:34,619
to keep track of the narrative and to keep

405
00:22:34,659 --> 00:22:38,802
track of all the connections and the references

406
00:22:38,902 --> 00:22:40,623
from one creation.

407
00:22:40,684 --> 00:22:42,985
And I say creation because now it's more than games.

408
00:22:43,786 --> 00:22:45,567
You have novels, you have short movies,

409
00:22:45,827 --> 00:22:48,429
you have comic books, even at the character levels.

410
00:22:49,016 --> 00:22:53,298
You know, who knew who, what is this piece of information

411
00:22:53,578 --> 00:22:55,799
launching this new novel?

412
00:22:55,919 --> 00:22:57,619
And we had good results.

413
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:00,741
If you look at Revelations, for example, in the game,

414
00:23:00,761 --> 00:23:04,602
Ezio find a book that you can buy.

415
00:23:04,622 --> 00:23:08,564
This is Renaissance, expanding the story of Altair,

416
00:23:08,724 --> 00:23:09,984
so bringing new stuff.

417
00:23:10,085 --> 00:23:13,306
It was not just the same thing than the script of the game.

418
00:23:13,987 --> 00:23:16,587
We also had Project Legacy that was a Facebook game.

419
00:23:17,047 --> 00:23:19,688
Really interesting laboratory to test things,

420
00:23:20,048 --> 00:23:22,269
especially when it comes to breaking the fourth wall

421
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:24,929
and include our audience within our universe.

422
00:23:26,430 --> 00:23:31,891
Embers was a short movie telling the story of the death of Ezio

423
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:34,572
that we couldn't do if we respect

424
00:23:34,732 --> 00:23:35,752
the rules of the Animus.

425
00:23:36,272 --> 00:23:39,293
So we couldn't do it in a game using the Animus,

426
00:23:39,833 --> 00:23:41,193
but with a short movie, it was good.

427
00:23:41,945 --> 00:23:46,307
And for example, with the comic book made by awarded authors

428
00:23:46,427 --> 00:23:50,328
Carl Kirchholz and Cameron Stewart, where it's funny for

429
00:23:50,348 --> 00:23:53,669
the anecdote, because six months prior to the release of

430
00:23:53,709 --> 00:23:56,849
the comic book, IGN released an article saying that

431
00:23:56,909 --> 00:24:00,170
basically all video games comic book adaptation would

432
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:03,891
suck, and then six months after, they said, you know

433
00:24:03,911 --> 00:24:06,592
what, we said that, but actually this one's pretty

434
00:24:06,632 --> 00:24:06,772
neat.

435
00:24:07,623 --> 00:24:08,183
with all of.

436
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:12,486
And up to the movie, actually, back in 2016,

437
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:15,587
which really helped raise the awareness of the franchise.

438
00:24:17,108 --> 00:24:19,910
Look at the bump in Asia, mostly, plus 14 points.

439
00:24:20,650 --> 00:24:25,533
So this transmedia strategy is still running today.

440
00:24:25,853 --> 00:24:27,594
This is still the way we see things.

441
00:24:28,094 --> 00:24:30,575
And we think that's the way to go for big universes,

442
00:24:30,695 --> 00:24:31,436
big franchises.

443
00:24:32,955 --> 00:24:38,497
But this also led us to go maybe a bit too far, as we know.

444
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:39,837
So breaking the fourth wall.

445
00:24:43,078 --> 00:24:45,558
The idea here, and I mentioned Project Legacy,

446
00:24:46,518 --> 00:24:51,300
was to say that Desmond Miles' story was really important.

447
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,700
Because it was the glue, it was the cement

448
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:57,841
between all the episodes, all of the first game.

449
00:24:58,241 --> 00:25:00,522
It was connecting time periods that had nothing

450
00:25:00,562 --> 00:25:02,182
to do one way with another.

451
00:25:03,317 --> 00:25:06,337
So it was the giving players and the audience

452
00:25:06,417 --> 00:25:08,718
this consistent story going on.

453
00:25:08,918 --> 00:25:10,759
But at some point it was really becoming

454
00:25:11,839 --> 00:25:13,739
constraining and limitating.

455
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:17,560
And so we needed to put it back to where it belonged,

456
00:25:18,181 --> 00:25:20,821
which means in the AC universe.

457
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:23,222
And Assassin's Creed telling stories

458
00:25:24,090 --> 00:25:30,452
during the humankind history as many, many different stories.

459
00:25:30,492 --> 00:25:33,293
I mean, we have potential thousands of stories.

460
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:35,654
And Desmond Miles is important, but it's one of them.

461
00:25:36,274 --> 00:25:38,795
And we wanted that to be able to put the players,

462
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:41,876
to put the audience, not only players, but readers,

463
00:25:42,656 --> 00:25:44,897
watchers, at the center of our universe.

464
00:25:46,185 --> 00:25:48,346
Our vision behind that was really,

465
00:25:48,366 --> 00:25:50,266
so this is the evolution of the franchise

466
00:25:50,306 --> 00:25:54,767
from AC1 to Unity, as originally planned back in 2011.

467
00:25:55,448 --> 00:25:59,188
And one thing that was key here was AC3 in 2012.

468
00:25:59,509 --> 00:25:59,789
Why?

469
00:26:00,329 --> 00:26:03,409
Because at that moment, when Desmond saved the world,

470
00:26:03,570 --> 00:26:05,950
basically what we're saying is that the real world

471
00:26:06,690 --> 00:26:09,131
and our fictitious world were colliding.

472
00:26:10,074 --> 00:26:13,259
And the idea behind that was that since then,

473
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:16,363
the present day of Assassin's Creed is our real world.

474
00:26:17,124 --> 00:26:19,408
And this is really cool in terms of narrative potential

475
00:26:19,488 --> 00:26:21,971
and crossover and things that we can do.

476
00:26:22,841 --> 00:26:25,043
So we wanted that to really, like I said,

477
00:26:25,124 --> 00:26:28,027
put the player and the audience inside our universe.

478
00:26:28,467 --> 00:26:31,610
No matter you like games better than comics, novels,

479
00:26:31,731 --> 00:26:34,193
or movies, you are inside of it.

480
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:38,878
And we wanted players to be actually part of this universe

481
00:26:38,918 --> 00:26:41,040
so that they could engage themselves.

482
00:26:41,721 --> 00:26:45,024
into this globally connected universe.

483
00:26:45,525 --> 00:26:48,128
So having connections, live connections,

484
00:26:48,948 --> 00:26:49,989
when talking about products,

485
00:26:50,290 --> 00:26:52,372
having this real transmedia storytelling,

486
00:26:53,853 --> 00:26:56,396
never contradicting one with another,

487
00:26:56,676 --> 00:26:58,478
and having the audience at the core of it.

488
00:26:59,199 --> 00:27:00,160
This is why, for example,

489
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,701
we created Abstergo Entertainment.

490
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:06,192
Because here, we were kind of turning around the rules of the Animus.

491
00:27:06,533 --> 00:27:09,176
We were bringing new ways to access memories

492
00:27:09,517 --> 00:27:11,800
to allow everybody and not only Desmond.

493
00:27:12,691 --> 00:27:13,551
to access memories.

494
00:27:13,711 --> 00:27:14,592
This was important.

495
00:27:15,272 --> 00:27:19,274
And the cornerstone was Initiates,

496
00:27:19,474 --> 00:27:20,475
our plan with Initiates.

497
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:24,437
Initiates was a website that was meant

498
00:27:24,477 --> 00:27:26,137
to become really the franchise hub.

499
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:28,739
Some of you may know about it already,

500
00:27:29,259 --> 00:27:31,360
but in case you never heard about it,

501
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,561
here's a video.

502
00:27:32,601 --> 00:27:34,401
This video is actually an internal one,

503
00:27:34,421 --> 00:27:36,242
so it's not a public one,

504
00:27:37,083 --> 00:27:39,724
showing the vision that we were having back then.

505
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:46,081
A secret war rages on.

506
00:27:47,001 --> 00:27:50,164
The Assassins and Templars fight to shape humanity's future.

507
00:27:50,945 --> 00:27:52,106
Dive into their conflict.

508
00:27:52,927 --> 00:27:53,487
Initiates.

509
00:27:56,089 --> 00:27:59,212
Explore the Assassin's Creed universe across land and centuries.

510
00:28:01,454 --> 00:28:08,160
Discover conspiracies and untold tales of the Brotherhood.

511
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:10,943
Earn rewards for your progress within Assassin's Creed.

512
00:28:15,692 --> 00:28:19,393
and take your experience further in exclusive new missions set within the games.

513
00:28:29,859 --> 00:28:35,481
Customize a unique identity and take your place within the Assassin's Creed universe.

514
00:28:36,862 --> 00:28:44,226
Connect with the community, unlock exclusive content, and extend your gaming experience.

515
00:28:50,707 --> 00:28:51,128
Join us.

516
00:29:08,122 --> 00:29:08,742
was getting it.

517
00:29:09,203 --> 00:29:10,163
They were really into it.

518
00:29:10,663 --> 00:29:13,264
And this is why Black Flag, in many ways,

519
00:29:13,524 --> 00:29:16,565
was a transition game into this big master plan.

520
00:29:16,925 --> 00:29:18,846
This is why the present day of Black Flag

521
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,226
was this first person version.

522
00:29:22,007 --> 00:29:24,908
It was meant to be you, the present day character,

523
00:29:25,528 --> 00:29:27,268
and with an experience that was already

524
00:29:27,368 --> 00:29:29,009
bigger than just the game.

525
00:29:29,569 --> 00:29:34,670
with the companion application and with the up and running

526
00:29:34,790 --> 00:29:35,890
website, Initiate.

527
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:37,311
It was working.

528
00:29:37,751 --> 00:29:41,351
We had super good content, exclusive content on Initiate.

529
00:29:41,511 --> 00:29:46,512
We even added submissions in Black Flag through the website.

530
00:29:46,972 --> 00:29:49,773
So we were pretty confident that this was the way to go.

531
00:29:50,333 --> 00:29:55,134
Thing is, and I will come back later on that topic, like I

532
00:29:55,194 --> 00:29:58,395
said, the hardcore fans were really into it and enjoyed it.

533
00:29:59,186 --> 00:30:02,907
But we didn't maybe listen enough to the mass,

534
00:30:03,287 --> 00:30:06,208
to the majority of our audience.

535
00:30:07,108 --> 00:30:09,669
And so Unity, that was the following game,

536
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:14,771
and remember, started back in 2011, after Brotherhood,

537
00:30:15,531 --> 00:30:17,512
was really meant to be the new next-gen game.

538
00:30:18,453 --> 00:30:23,895
And if you remember Assassin's Creed 1, it had some similarities actually.

539
00:30:24,576 --> 00:30:31,679
Because there was a lot of work being done at a very low level in terms of tech.

540
00:30:31,699 --> 00:30:38,062
You know, the engine was massively revamped with some fantastic rendering things.

541
00:30:38,102 --> 00:30:42,524
I mean, still today, Unity, I deeply believe it, is a...

542
00:30:43,708 --> 00:30:46,214
is still one of the best looking game ever.

543
00:30:46,816 --> 00:30:49,724
But at the same time we moved to a one-to-one scale building

544
00:30:50,105 --> 00:30:52,411
that had impact also on the navigation.

545
00:30:53,810 --> 00:30:56,132
And so the gameplay was impacted,

546
00:30:56,632 --> 00:30:58,873
not talking about the co-op development.

547
00:30:59,333 --> 00:31:01,915
And so we fell again a bit in this trap

548
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:06,077
of working a lot on the tech and not allowing

549
00:31:06,177 --> 00:31:10,159
enough the teams that create the content to actually come up

550
00:31:10,179 --> 00:31:11,040
with something new.

551
00:31:11,460 --> 00:31:14,862
And so in the end, that's the way I see it, actually.

552
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:18,404
I think we created the perfect condition for a perfect storm.

553
00:31:18,944 --> 00:31:21,725
We had a game that was wonderful in terms of art.

554
00:31:24,008 --> 00:31:27,413
but that was not renewing enough the experience, right?

555
00:31:27,833 --> 00:31:31,839
And this map full of icons is maybe the best representation.

556
00:31:32,420 --> 00:31:35,364
At the same time, our vision about Initiate

557
00:31:35,564 --> 00:31:37,988
and an experience that was bigger than the game,

558
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:40,608
hurt us also a lot.

559
00:31:41,048 --> 00:31:42,889
Because we came up with some design loops

560
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,472
that people weren't ready and we didn't explain properly.

561
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,234
And so having content locked in the game,

562
00:31:49,634 --> 00:31:51,716
you know, and that you needed asking you

563
00:31:51,756 --> 00:31:53,237
to do things on the website.

564
00:31:53,637 --> 00:31:56,319
And people got like, what's that for exactly?

565
00:31:56,899 --> 00:31:57,480
Are you kidding me?

566
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:00,001
And so on top of that, Sunday when

567
00:32:00,021 --> 00:32:03,344
you get this kind of cherry, it hurts.

568
00:32:03,444 --> 00:32:06,206
And by the way, I need to precise that it was only

569
00:32:06,466 --> 00:32:07,787
one graphic card on PC only.

570
00:32:09,437 --> 00:32:13,299
But so, whatever, I mean, the game suffered from all this,

571
00:32:13,459 --> 00:32:17,201
even if, I mean, played today with all the fixes,

572
00:32:17,281 --> 00:32:19,182
it's still a very beautiful and very good game.

573
00:32:19,322 --> 00:32:23,425
But in short, we probably flew too close to the sun,

574
00:32:23,445 --> 00:32:25,826
too far, we were a bit overconfident.

575
00:32:26,266 --> 00:32:31,049
And this is why Syndicate had to really focus on quality.

576
00:32:31,609 --> 00:32:33,271
which the team did very, very well.

577
00:32:33,291 --> 00:32:35,493
I mean, Syndicate is a very fun game,

578
00:32:36,614 --> 00:32:39,296
well-polished, with a very interesting narrative twist

579
00:32:39,396 --> 00:32:41,638
with the Frightwins.

580
00:32:42,179 --> 00:32:45,521
And so this was basically the only thing we could do

581
00:32:45,822 --> 00:32:48,964
with Syndicate to actually solidify

582
00:32:50,045 --> 00:32:52,548
the experience that we knew how to do.

583
00:32:53,609 --> 00:32:57,653
But we also knew it was time, this time, for a strong,

584
00:32:57,693 --> 00:32:59,314
and for a big, big refresh.

585
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:04,238
And when I talk about refresh, I never talk about reboot.

586
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:07,561
Actually, we had tons of discussions internally,

587
00:33:08,082 --> 00:33:11,004
and I always fought to say refresh more than reboot.

588
00:33:11,705 --> 00:33:14,928
Because at the same time, I felt it was super important

589
00:33:14,948 --> 00:33:16,729
to respect our franchise.

590
00:33:16,969 --> 00:33:19,151
We know Assassin's Creed, we own it.

591
00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:23,714
We are the only ones that can adapt it without betraying it.

592
00:33:24,194 --> 00:33:27,596
So the two aspects are key in my mind.

593
00:33:28,597 --> 00:33:31,098
And let's start with the refresh of the experience.

594
00:33:31,458 --> 00:33:33,820
This was the key thing.

595
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:37,462
At first, we needed clear priorities.

596
00:33:38,102 --> 00:33:40,984
So in 2014, this is a team meeting slide.

597
00:33:41,684 --> 00:33:45,826
The four big direction, basically, I gave to the team

598
00:33:45,866 --> 00:33:48,808
was, OK, we need to show that we master open world creation.

599
00:33:50,251 --> 00:33:53,792
We need to find a better, if not perfect, balance

600
00:33:54,092 --> 00:33:56,993
between the story and player's agency, be less hand-holding.

601
00:33:58,034 --> 00:34:01,295
We need to be a not-skippable episode in the AC universe

602
00:34:01,675 --> 00:34:05,056
and to remain a connected game, even if without co-op.

603
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:09,078
We need to show that being part of the community

604
00:34:09,478 --> 00:34:11,979
brings value to your overall experience.

605
00:34:12,659 --> 00:34:14,360
We're not a competitive franchise,

606
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,701
but the community is very, very strong,

607
00:34:17,141 --> 00:34:18,121
and we need to leverage that.

608
00:34:18,962 --> 00:34:26,067
And so the idea behind modernizing AC was really to have the focus in terms of fluidity and player's freedom.

609
00:34:26,667 --> 00:34:28,909
That was key message given to the team.

610
00:34:29,449 --> 00:34:35,053
It's not about us, it's about the players and they want to be free, they want to do what they want.

611
00:34:36,454 --> 00:34:41,418
And if needed, we need to adapt ourselves, our tools, our cultures.

612
00:34:42,663 --> 00:34:46,526
And so making a modern Assassin's Creed

613
00:34:46,546 --> 00:34:48,907
was really about being more systemic,

614
00:34:49,668 --> 00:34:52,330
more player-friendly, more connected,

615
00:34:52,550 --> 00:34:55,832
and also, like I said, having a modernized pipeline.

616
00:34:56,493 --> 00:34:58,594
This is why we came up with this

617
00:34:59,154 --> 00:35:00,916
archipelago structure of the world.

618
00:35:01,767 --> 00:35:06,989
So if you remember, this is basically the core team of Origins is the one that delivered

619
00:35:07,009 --> 00:35:07,530
Black Flag.

620
00:35:07,970 --> 00:35:13,752
And so we came up with this structure of the world where procedural tools would allow us

621
00:35:13,832 --> 00:35:20,334
to create a lot of terrain, of ground, but where artists and level design were still

622
00:35:20,475 --> 00:35:27,017
owner of location, precise locations to really have high quality and crafted locations.

623
00:35:28,161 --> 00:35:30,223
At the same time, even with the eagle,

624
00:35:30,243 --> 00:35:33,225
so you see this is a prototype from the end of 2014.

625
00:35:33,345 --> 00:35:37,468
With the eagle, the intention was to redefine

626
00:35:37,488 --> 00:35:39,750
the way we understand the world,

627
00:35:40,170 --> 00:35:41,551
the way we interact with it,

628
00:35:42,572 --> 00:35:44,053
and the way we see it living.

629
00:35:44,133 --> 00:35:45,515
Remember, living and breathing world,

630
00:35:45,555 --> 00:35:47,036
we said that for 10 years now,

631
00:35:47,116 --> 00:35:49,558
but this had to be true more than ever.

632
00:35:51,139 --> 00:35:52,820
So it's good to have a big world,

633
00:35:53,701 --> 00:35:55,843
but we needed to feel it in a meaningful way.

634
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:59,377
And so this is why we came up with this meta AI,

635
00:35:59,578 --> 00:36:00,638
the global AI.

636
00:36:01,059 --> 00:36:04,621
Something, think about an RTS AI

637
00:36:05,342 --> 00:36:07,083
set on top of an open world game

638
00:36:07,503 --> 00:36:09,185
where people would have their agenda

639
00:36:09,385 --> 00:36:11,586
and bringing credibility to the world

640
00:36:12,127 --> 00:36:14,508
while letting systems work all together

641
00:36:15,189 --> 00:36:18,291
and interact together to create emerging situations

642
00:36:18,351 --> 00:36:20,933
that we would not have predicted.

643
00:36:21,614 --> 00:36:24,937
And this was a very important step forward

644
00:36:24,997 --> 00:36:26,638
because the teams needed to understand

645
00:36:26,678 --> 00:36:28,780
that we needed to work more on situations

646
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:32,043
and create good conditions of things to happen

647
00:36:32,243 --> 00:36:35,566
rather than scenarios that need to unfold

648
00:36:35,706 --> 00:36:37,308
in that specific sequence.

649
00:36:38,645 --> 00:36:41,806
And obviously, one of the big topic was also the fight,

650
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:45,847
where we moved from animation paired system,

651
00:36:46,147 --> 00:36:49,428
paired animation system, sorry, to a hitbox system.

652
00:36:49,948 --> 00:36:52,228
And this was meant to really bring a fight

653
00:36:52,268 --> 00:36:54,249
that was more challenging, that was deeper,

654
00:36:54,369 --> 00:36:58,050
with meaningful weapons, being more reactive also,

655
00:36:58,530 --> 00:37:00,130
and way more modern.

656
00:37:00,730 --> 00:37:03,591
And this was coming also with, as you can see,

657
00:37:03,631 --> 00:37:04,872
transition animation shorter.

658
00:37:04,912 --> 00:37:06,772
Animation won't always match perfectly.

659
00:37:07,432 --> 00:37:09,233
That's OK from a player's perspective.

660
00:37:09,694 --> 00:37:12,255
But some of the team was struggling with that.

661
00:37:12,976 --> 00:37:15,237
And so in the end, we had to keep

662
00:37:15,277 --> 00:37:19,880
repeating that it was a cultural shift for the developers

663
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,681
as much as a technological one.

664
00:37:22,241 --> 00:37:23,382
This was really important.

665
00:37:23,842 --> 00:37:25,743
And we kept repeating that to the team.

666
00:37:25,783 --> 00:37:28,405
We should focus on the experience and not

667
00:37:28,425 --> 00:37:29,845
the scripting or hard coding.

668
00:37:30,646 --> 00:37:32,467
Players don't care about our code.

669
00:37:32,707 --> 00:37:34,828
They just care about their experience.

670
00:37:35,885 --> 00:37:40,066
And so we needed to understand that losing a bit of control

671
00:37:40,686 --> 00:37:43,046
would bring more fun to the players

672
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:44,887
rather than creating issues.

673
00:37:44,967 --> 00:37:47,287
And I mean, I had people came to me saying,

674
00:37:47,307 --> 00:37:49,888
do you really want to deliver a crappy game?

675
00:37:50,208 --> 00:37:50,608
I said, no.

676
00:37:51,228 --> 00:37:52,029
It won't be the same.

677
00:37:52,049 --> 00:37:53,149
It will be fun.

678
00:37:54,469 --> 00:37:58,270
And so, yeah, I called that operation losing the tie.

679
00:37:59,911 --> 00:38:04,052
Same badass and quality, but can we just breathe a bit more?

680
00:38:05,358 --> 00:38:07,179
more open, more fluid, and more modern.

681
00:38:07,999 --> 00:38:08,739
So that was the goal.

682
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,220
But that was not an easy road.

683
00:38:11,901 --> 00:38:15,982
And so if you want to come by Montreal, work with us,

684
00:38:17,603 --> 00:38:18,283
be prepared.

685
00:38:18,363 --> 00:38:20,164
This is the kind of streets we have.

686
00:38:23,425 --> 00:38:24,886
But the balance was hard to find.

687
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:30,781
So again, 2016, we had to, I mean, it was a constant,

688
00:38:30,801 --> 00:38:34,561
you know, repeat process to explain that, for example,

689
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:37,422
the setting, the envelope of the experience,

690
00:38:37,802 --> 00:38:39,442
so the time period, the world, the stories,

691
00:38:39,743 --> 00:38:40,703
we knew how to do that.

692
00:38:41,323 --> 00:38:43,163
We did it already many times.

693
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:46,124
But all the structure of the experience,

694
00:38:46,664 --> 00:38:47,704
a lot of that was new.

695
00:38:48,404 --> 00:38:50,245
We're literally moving from, you know,

696
00:38:50,285 --> 00:38:52,805
a gas engine to electrical car.

697
00:38:53,700 --> 00:38:57,263
And this is not easy.

698
00:38:57,303 --> 00:38:59,784
We were out of our comfort zone.

699
00:39:00,765 --> 00:39:04,887
So at some point, we had teams not liking each other.

700
00:39:05,956 --> 00:39:09,559
I mean, the guys in charge of all the systemic aspects were coming to us and say,

701
00:39:10,059 --> 00:39:14,782
okay, these people, they want to tell stories and they want to control the systems.

702
00:39:15,363 --> 00:39:18,585
How are we supposed to do systemic things if you want to control them?

703
00:39:19,045 --> 00:39:21,287
And on the other side, the narrative team was coming and saying,

704
00:39:21,647 --> 00:39:24,009
how are we supposed to tell stories if they want, you know,

705
00:39:24,209 --> 00:39:27,771
they don't want less to take control of the systems?

706
00:39:28,412 --> 00:39:31,634
So we had these tensions, but in the end it turned well.

707
00:39:32,324 --> 00:39:35,525
I think we all respect each other.

708
00:39:35,665 --> 00:39:38,906
We are all seasoned developers.

709
00:39:39,746 --> 00:39:40,946
And we found this balance.

710
00:39:41,146 --> 00:39:43,347
Remember the first, the objective, second objective

711
00:39:43,467 --> 00:39:46,648
balance between a narrative and player's agency?

712
00:39:47,128 --> 00:39:49,868
Where with this quest structure, we

713
00:39:49,888 --> 00:39:52,489
would have narratives, meaningful narratives,

714
00:39:52,569 --> 00:39:56,210
but using the systems, not directing every single bit

715
00:39:56,530 --> 00:39:57,410
of each mission.

716
00:39:58,316 --> 00:40:00,657
And so these were really the big, big things

717
00:40:00,697 --> 00:40:01,678
that we need to change.

718
00:40:02,058 --> 00:40:05,180
But at the same time, every day, every week, every month,

719
00:40:05,580 --> 00:40:08,102
we had to ask ourselves, what should we keep?

720
00:40:08,782 --> 00:40:09,663
What should we change?

721
00:40:10,163 --> 00:40:12,064
For example, think about the climbing.

722
00:40:12,825 --> 00:40:14,726
We knew that set in ancient Egypt,

723
00:40:15,146 --> 00:40:16,527
climbing were less prominent.

724
00:40:16,627 --> 00:40:18,809
I mean, we have less buildings, that's for sure.

725
00:40:19,169 --> 00:40:21,610
So how do we keep this verticality

726
00:40:21,831 --> 00:40:23,271
that is really needed for AC?

727
00:40:24,124 --> 00:40:26,347
Well, we want the navigation, we want the climbing

728
00:40:26,787 --> 00:40:28,188
to be available on all cliffs,

729
00:40:28,709 --> 00:40:30,751
so that we could have set up in camps,

730
00:40:31,091 --> 00:40:33,394
you know, in caves, using the mountains

731
00:40:33,914 --> 00:40:35,456
as a level design element.

732
00:40:37,118 --> 00:40:39,800
I like this example first because it's a very old video,

733
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,382
as you can see the world here,

734
00:40:42,143 --> 00:40:44,906
but it's about the reach high points, you know,

735
00:40:44,966 --> 00:40:45,506
the way points.

736
00:40:46,393 --> 00:40:47,293
What do we do with that?

737
00:40:47,673 --> 00:40:48,574
This is key.

738
00:40:48,634 --> 00:40:50,355
I mean, it's iconic of Assassin's Creed.

739
00:40:50,415 --> 00:40:51,495
You need to climb something,

740
00:40:51,535 --> 00:40:53,896
you dominate the world of these wonderful vistas,

741
00:40:54,356 --> 00:40:56,197
and then it ends up with the leap of faith.

742
00:40:56,977 --> 00:40:58,958
Which is, I mean, these three elements

743
00:40:59,178 --> 00:41:01,739
are almost defining what Assassin's Creed is.

744
00:41:02,866 --> 00:41:04,327
So do we keep it or not?

745
00:41:05,167 --> 00:41:07,328
If we keep it, it makes sense.

746
00:41:08,028 --> 00:41:12,970
But at the same time, we need to remove the link between that

747
00:41:13,550 --> 00:41:14,870
and the discovery of the world.

748
00:41:15,091 --> 00:41:18,632
Because this was feeling very old, very the same way.

749
00:41:18,972 --> 00:41:20,713
So this is why we kept the feature,

750
00:41:21,253 --> 00:41:23,073
but we changed its utility.

751
00:41:23,514 --> 00:41:26,275
You don't unfog the map anymore with that.

752
00:41:27,675 --> 00:41:30,876
We asked ourselves a lot about social self.

753
00:41:31,665 --> 00:41:34,047
Does it make sense for Bayek to blend in groups?

754
00:41:34,988 --> 00:41:38,271
While in the narrative side, he's not per se an assassin,

755
00:41:38,311 --> 00:41:40,413
he's more a proto-assassin, more of a warrior.

756
00:41:40,753 --> 00:41:43,796
Doesn't make any real sense to have him with big axes,

757
00:41:43,856 --> 00:41:46,778
you know, hiding among civilians.

758
00:41:46,939 --> 00:41:50,362
So we decided to focus instead on environmental stealth.

759
00:41:51,162 --> 00:41:53,044
This is why the hidden blade, for example,

760
00:41:53,144 --> 00:41:55,866
that was the nuclear weapon of assassins,

761
00:41:56,407 --> 00:41:59,509
and that was preventing us from having a good progression.

762
00:42:00,362 --> 00:42:06,746
because you don't care about being level 40 if with one hit with the blade you can kill anybody.

763
00:42:07,306 --> 00:42:11,149
So we needed to accept that the blade would need to be upgraded.

764
00:42:11,169 --> 00:42:16,172
And even the chests. We have quite a lot of chests still.

765
00:42:16,492 --> 00:42:19,013
But do we want the map to be filled with this type of icons?

766
00:42:19,734 --> 00:42:21,795
When we can actually just change the icon?

767
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:28,887
and having an icon better suited for the setting

768
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:32,911
and removing this reference to the old chest formula.

769
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:36,094
And so this was the way we worked

770
00:42:36,214 --> 00:42:37,475
to refresh the experience.

771
00:42:37,855 --> 00:42:39,297
At the same time, like I was saying,

772
00:42:39,677 --> 00:42:43,681
we needed to refresh and to respect our identity.

773
00:42:44,723 --> 00:42:48,685
And what I mean is that we tried to create as many references

774
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:54,186
and connection between origins and past games.

775
00:42:55,286 --> 00:42:58,227
For example, the eagle, obviously, was important.

776
00:42:58,887 --> 00:43:00,628
It's key to the franchise.

777
00:43:00,648 --> 00:43:02,988
Think about Assassin's Creed 1 part.

778
00:43:04,329 --> 00:43:07,610
Having the cut finger also to hold the blade was important.

779
00:43:08,090 --> 00:43:10,592
And even in the posing of Altair and marketing assets,

780
00:43:10,672 --> 00:43:12,453
even if we never juxtaposed the two,

781
00:43:12,813 --> 00:43:15,475
there was this reminiscence of AC1.

782
00:43:16,036 --> 00:43:19,418
The use of artifacts also was the same.

783
00:43:19,678 --> 00:43:22,240
Whereas the first game set prior to AC1,

784
00:43:23,441 --> 00:43:25,342
but we didn't want to fall into this

785
00:43:25,883 --> 00:43:28,745
totally crazy fantasy of Egypt.

786
00:43:29,445 --> 00:43:32,948
So we kept that low profile basically.

787
00:43:33,429 --> 00:43:35,891
But the way we treated the first Siv drawings

788
00:43:36,311 --> 00:43:38,713
was the exact same, right?

789
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:40,855
This is actually the exact, I mean,

790
00:43:40,895 --> 00:43:42,777
that's the same artist that did both.

791
00:43:44,263 --> 00:43:45,844
With Aya, sorry for the spoiler,

792
00:43:45,944 --> 00:43:48,686
but I assume that you know everything I'm talking about.

793
00:43:49,486 --> 00:43:52,969
In AC2, we had Amunet in the vault, right?

794
00:43:53,169 --> 00:43:57,072
Famous Egyptian assassin, where we reveal that's Aya.

795
00:43:57,732 --> 00:43:59,533
And in the DLC, The Hidden Ones,

796
00:43:59,834 --> 00:44:02,876
her costume is directly inspired from the vault of AC2.

797
00:44:03,176 --> 00:44:05,378
So you see creating references, loops like that,

798
00:44:05,838 --> 00:44:08,460
even with this final scene echoing

799
00:44:08,480 --> 00:44:10,641
the trailer of Assassin's Creed 1.

800
00:44:11,941 --> 00:44:14,264
And so with these little details,

801
00:44:15,526 --> 00:44:20,433
I think we managed to always secure, especially our fans,

802
00:44:20,873 --> 00:44:24,438
that this was a true Assassin's Creed game.

803
00:44:25,079 --> 00:44:26,662
And this was also true with the present day.

804
00:44:27,931 --> 00:44:33,173
We are back with the formula with the third person character, introducing Leila, because

805
00:44:33,193 --> 00:44:38,736
we think this formula has a lot to bring in terms of narrative, and it's better understood.

806
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:41,917
But even with that, we can create connections.

807
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:51,202
William is Desmond's father, and if you look into our computer, you have tons of references

808
00:44:51,242 --> 00:44:52,843
to other games and the movies.

809
00:44:54,123 --> 00:44:54,403
And so...

810
00:44:55,785 --> 00:45:00,208
That's the way we refresh and respect Assassin's Creed.

811
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:03,971
In a few words, basically I would have to say

812
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:05,672
that know your brand first.

813
00:45:05,972 --> 00:45:09,014
If you don't want people to screw it, to dilute it,

814
00:45:09,535 --> 00:45:12,357
to say or do things that are not supposed to be done,

815
00:45:12,997 --> 00:45:15,959
know it and communicate it, right?

816
00:45:16,239 --> 00:45:17,720
Think about the Bibles, et cetera.

817
00:45:18,320 --> 00:45:21,481
In terms of gameplay, you need to clearly identify your strengths.

818
00:45:22,041 --> 00:45:26,602
What are the things, the features that make your game shine,

819
00:45:26,922 --> 00:45:29,803
so that you can focus on it and try to disperse yourself.

820
00:45:30,423 --> 00:45:33,184
But at the same time, don't hesitate to grow your teams.

821
00:45:33,864 --> 00:45:37,104
This growth of Assassin's Creed during the last decade

822
00:45:37,144 --> 00:45:40,125
would not have been possible without other studios all around the world.

823
00:45:40,605 --> 00:45:44,166
If we were too protective, this wouldn't work.

824
00:45:44,586 --> 00:45:46,646
The same with external teams.

825
00:45:47,757 --> 00:45:50,380
comics, movies, et cetera.

826
00:45:50,940 --> 00:45:52,842
And the last lesson I would encourage you

827
00:45:52,882 --> 00:45:54,103
is to listen to your audience.

828
00:45:55,384 --> 00:45:56,605
We really try to do it.

829
00:45:57,386 --> 00:46:00,449
With this, you know, Initiates, Global Hub, et cetera,

830
00:46:00,489 --> 00:46:01,930
we went probably a bit too far.

831
00:46:02,351 --> 00:46:06,374
But in general, I mean, you need to listen to your audience,

832
00:46:06,534 --> 00:46:07,896
not only the hardcore fans.

833
00:46:09,037 --> 00:46:10,098
That's the advice I would say.

834
00:46:10,658 --> 00:46:13,061
So just to finish finish, it's actually quite simple.

835
00:46:13,121 --> 00:46:14,222
I like this slide.

836
00:46:14,943 --> 00:46:18,427
For me, it's creation in general, conception in general,

837
00:46:18,888 --> 00:46:22,772
developing games or whatever, is all about this Taishi

838
00:46:22,812 --> 00:46:24,694
mentality, being solid.

839
00:46:25,535 --> 00:46:26,536
You know what you want to do.

840
00:46:27,521 --> 00:46:29,243
At the same time, remaining flexible,

841
00:46:29,463 --> 00:46:32,906
you need to be able to adapt to opportunities or issues

842
00:46:33,586 --> 00:46:35,848
and remain open so that you can work with others

843
00:46:35,929 --> 00:46:39,852
that will bring you solutions, ideas, et cetera.

844
00:46:40,372 --> 00:46:45,077
So it's this constant flux between solidity,

845
00:46:45,157 --> 00:46:48,340
not stiffness, and flexibility.

846
00:46:49,481 --> 00:46:50,321
And that's it for me today.

847
00:46:50,582 --> 00:46:51,122
Thank you very much.

848
00:47:01,113 --> 00:47:04,054
So I think we have time for some questions.

849
00:47:04,234 --> 00:47:05,214
You can come to the mic.

850
00:47:06,555 --> 00:47:09,996
Or after in the follow-up outlooks.

851
00:47:10,576 --> 00:47:11,137
Any questions?

852
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:11,877
Yes?

853
00:47:12,117 --> 00:47:12,917
Hi.

854
00:47:12,957 --> 00:47:13,278
Thank you.

855
00:47:13,558 --> 00:47:16,239
So history is a very big part of the franchise.

856
00:47:16,259 --> 00:47:18,119
So how do you decide which country

857
00:47:18,179 --> 00:47:20,460
or which kind of historic US you choose

858
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,821
to work on for each games?

859
00:47:21,921 --> 00:47:22,201
Thank you.

860
00:47:23,762 --> 00:47:28,023
So that's a very common question in the sense

861
00:47:28,063 --> 00:47:28,203
that.

862
00:47:29,368 --> 00:47:31,689
There is a lot of guessing, people

863
00:47:31,869 --> 00:47:34,410
trying to guess what's the next installment.

864
00:47:35,350 --> 00:47:37,891
It's always a discussion between the creative team,

865
00:47:38,171 --> 00:47:41,733
the developers, the marketing, the HQ.

866
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:43,594
We need to come up with an agreement where

867
00:47:43,894 --> 00:47:47,575
the team feels empowered about the setting.

868
00:47:47,655 --> 00:47:49,776
That's something they really want to explore.

869
00:47:50,196 --> 00:47:52,577
At the same time, we need to secure that it

870
00:47:52,617 --> 00:47:54,738
had some marketing appeal.

871
00:47:55,238 --> 00:47:57,719
So there is no rule, I would say.

872
00:47:57,759 --> 00:47:58,820
So it's really a...

873
00:47:59,820 --> 00:48:01,540
Which time period are you interested in?

874
00:48:01,680 --> 00:48:04,301
Does it make sense from a business point of perspective?

875
00:48:04,821 --> 00:48:05,941
Is the audience ready for that?

876
00:48:06,021 --> 00:48:06,502
Yes, okay.

877
00:48:07,442 --> 00:48:08,162
It's as simple.

878
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:11,003
There is no golden rule for everything.

879
00:48:11,723 --> 00:48:14,604
That's what I tried to explain here with the Tai Chi thing.

880
00:48:15,324 --> 00:48:16,705
You need to know what you want to do,

881
00:48:16,785 --> 00:48:19,725
but at the same time be able to adapt every time.

882
00:48:21,446 --> 00:48:21,706
Hey John.

883
00:48:22,969 --> 00:48:27,651
So, you were talking a little bit about the brand strategy and transmedia stuff.

884
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:31,933
So, one of the more recent decisions that's kind of drawn a little bit of ire from the fans

885
00:48:32,053 --> 00:48:36,575
is taking the Juno plotline, which was started five plus years ago,

886
00:48:37,055 --> 00:48:40,096
and shifting that to the comics and then kind of abandoning it in the games.

887
00:48:40,156 --> 00:48:44,718
And I was wondering if you could talk a little bit about what goes into making a decision like that,

888
00:48:44,738 --> 00:48:46,159
and if there are any lessons learned.

889
00:48:47,793 --> 00:48:51,035
Well, it's always a matter of what's more important.

890
00:48:51,915 --> 00:48:53,936
And who does it affect?

891
00:48:55,436 --> 00:48:57,997
What are the means that need to be put in place

892
00:48:58,057 --> 00:48:59,058
to deliver it properly?

893
00:48:59,718 --> 00:49:02,019
And so it's always discussions.

894
00:49:02,099 --> 00:49:06,541
There is, and so Juno, we know, is really, really,

895
00:49:06,641 --> 00:49:09,842
and was really, really important for a part of our audience.

896
00:49:10,862 --> 00:49:13,023
But when you look at the overall audience,

897
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:17,015
Not so many people actually know about Juno.

898
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:21,939
So we knew it was important and we needed a sense of closure for this story.

899
00:49:23,320 --> 00:49:29,606
But that was not and that couldn't ever be the core narrative of one big game.

900
00:49:30,767 --> 00:49:35,633
So this is why basically we came up with this solution.

901
00:49:36,073 --> 00:49:39,617
But it's always a discussion, like I tried to explain also

902
00:49:39,657 --> 00:49:42,160
with the discussion we had for features of the game,

903
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:46,564
there is nothing as, okay, here is the rule on everything

904
00:49:46,625 --> 00:49:47,806
that is valid for everything.

905
00:49:48,186 --> 00:49:48,867
So it's always...

906
00:49:49,993 --> 00:49:51,134
bit by bit, piece by piece.

907
00:49:51,294 --> 00:49:52,834
I don't know how to say that in English properly.

908
00:49:53,534 --> 00:49:55,735
And so at least I think that now there

909
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:59,276
is a sense of closure for this narrative line.

910
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,657
We know that some people would have preferred

911
00:50:02,697 --> 00:50:03,917
to have that in games.

912
00:50:03,957 --> 00:50:06,698
But at the same time, especially with Origins also,

913
00:50:06,738 --> 00:50:09,999
we knew we wanted to attract and to bring newcomers

914
00:50:10,059 --> 00:50:10,819
to the franchise.

915
00:50:11,499 --> 00:50:15,060
And being set prior to SE1 was a good way to say, you know what?

916
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:16,680
There is no narrative barrier.

917
00:50:17,341 --> 00:50:18,301
So come with us.

918
00:50:22,731 --> 00:50:27,759
Hi, can you talk a little bit about how you were able to collect feedback from a more

919
00:50:27,799 --> 00:50:28,620
general audience?

920
00:50:28,760 --> 00:50:32,906
Because they tend to be a little bit less vocal, so what were your strategies for getting

921
00:50:32,926 --> 00:50:33,467
that feedback?

922
00:50:34,595 --> 00:50:37,777
Well, we always do surveys, post-launch surveys.

923
00:50:38,257 --> 00:50:41,680
We have teams that are specialized into that,

924
00:50:41,720 --> 00:50:46,082
trying to analyze the way people play our games, what they like,

925
00:50:46,122 --> 00:50:47,343
what they dislike about them.

926
00:50:47,883 --> 00:50:51,585
And so this is, I would say, mostly the way

927
00:50:52,186 --> 00:50:54,027
we go into details.

928
00:50:54,427 --> 00:50:56,388
But at the same time, our community managers

929
00:50:56,448 --> 00:50:59,830
are doing a fantastic job to be really in contact.

930
00:51:00,411 --> 00:51:03,573
with the audience in general and so to gather feedbacks,

931
00:51:04,034 --> 00:51:05,775
no matter, I mean, whatever they are,

932
00:51:06,776 --> 00:51:10,079
so that we can try, but there's always a guess in the end,

933
00:51:10,099 --> 00:51:13,022
right, and so, but we also look at the competition,

934
00:51:13,162 --> 00:51:16,865
how the industry is evolving, and so we need to

935
00:51:16,905 --> 00:51:18,566
find our place into that.

936
00:51:18,807 --> 00:51:24,271
There's no massive worldwide, you know, thing to say, okay.

937
00:51:25,480 --> 00:51:27,521
and we know exactly what you want.

938
00:51:27,901 --> 00:51:29,662
But we have tools like that, strategies,

939
00:51:29,722 --> 00:51:31,323
to know better, at least.

940
00:51:31,903 --> 00:51:32,184
Thank you.

941
00:51:32,204 --> 00:51:33,204
You're welcome.

942
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,206
Hi, you talked about growing your teams

943
00:51:37,326 --> 00:51:38,767
in multiple locations.

944
00:51:39,788 --> 00:51:41,749
Could you give us an idea of how many people

945
00:51:41,809 --> 00:51:44,050
you have in each of the locations,

946
00:51:44,110 --> 00:51:47,852
and is there a limit on how big a geographical location

947
00:51:47,912 --> 00:51:49,573
can be in terms of one part of your team?

948
00:51:51,720 --> 00:51:55,521
There's no limits per se, it's really based on each studio management,

949
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:58,862
you know, to say we're capping for some reason,

950
00:51:59,362 --> 00:52:01,943
this team can't grow more than this.

951
00:52:02,923 --> 00:52:05,184
And then it's really on the producer's side

952
00:52:05,204 --> 00:52:10,605
to be in constant, you know, contact with these teams.

953
00:52:11,345 --> 00:52:15,766
In the end, the last big games are, we're talking about several hundred people.

954
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:19,607
I can't give you exact figures, but several hundred.

955
00:52:21,456 --> 00:52:23,739
We were, I think, more than 300 in Montreal only.

956
00:52:24,279 --> 00:52:27,624
And so big teams in Singapore, also Sophia,

957
00:52:28,004 --> 00:52:32,009
plus some others in Chengdu, in Montpellier, a lot of studios.

958
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:35,293
But it's really about collaborating.

959
00:52:35,333 --> 00:52:37,496
So we are, for example, in the lead studio,

960
00:52:38,077 --> 00:52:39,819
typically as a collaboration team.

961
00:52:40,618 --> 00:52:45,720
where we have a producer, a technical guy, a design person.

962
00:52:46,120 --> 00:52:50,482
That are the key contact points for the other studios.

963
00:52:51,242 --> 00:52:53,883
And so to make sure that the communication goes well,

964
00:52:54,003 --> 00:52:54,483
it's hard.

965
00:52:54,563 --> 00:52:59,285
It's not always easy, especially for the co-development studios

966
00:52:59,485 --> 00:53:02,267
that are most of the time waiting for things

967
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:03,047
from the lead studio.

968
00:53:04,211 --> 00:53:06,653
But in the end, it works well.

969
00:53:07,734 --> 00:53:10,457
Does the co-development studio get creative control

970
00:53:10,497 --> 00:53:12,138
of the area within their mandate?

971
00:53:13,079 --> 00:53:13,700
Yes, more and more.

972
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,281
That's the idea of the co-development

973
00:53:15,321 --> 00:53:18,704
versus the collaboration, where the collaboration is really

974
00:53:18,744 --> 00:53:19,946
about, OK, you do this.

975
00:53:21,232 --> 00:53:25,834
that way, almost, when with the co-dev is really, we are teams, you know?

976
00:53:26,315 --> 00:53:33,679
And so when you think about Origins, Sophia had the responsibility to bring all the tombs,

977
00:53:34,199 --> 00:53:40,743
all the pyramids, for example, for the entire games, plus their region, including their

978
00:53:40,783 --> 00:53:41,823
narrative, et cetera.

979
00:53:42,764 --> 00:53:45,205
And Singapore did all the water tech.

980
00:53:46,717 --> 00:53:49,678
with the Feluccas, with the naval missions, with all this.

981
00:53:49,758 --> 00:53:50,639
And these were there.

982
00:53:50,919 --> 00:53:52,479
So obviously we were giving feedback.

983
00:53:52,839 --> 00:53:55,420
Montreal was giving feedback with them, working on that.

984
00:53:55,460 --> 00:53:57,681
But that's their stuff.

985
00:53:57,701 --> 00:54:01,602
They developed systems specifically for that from,

986
00:54:02,242 --> 00:54:05,023
I mean, because they wanted to.

987
00:54:05,263 --> 00:54:06,304
For me as a creative director,

988
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:09,445
I'm responsible for the overall experience.

989
00:54:10,264 --> 00:54:11,766
So I won't go into the detail.

990
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,508
I'm not the game designer above the game designer.

991
00:54:14,608 --> 00:54:18,432
I'm not the artistic director above the artistic director.

992
00:54:18,793 --> 00:54:20,695
My focus is really the global experience.

993
00:54:20,735 --> 00:54:24,799
So if it's in line, if the purpose is good,

994
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:27,521
if it fits the global vision, then do it.

995
00:54:28,282 --> 00:54:28,763
Great, thank you.

996
00:54:30,011 --> 00:54:32,513
Hi, so firstly it was a great talk, so thanks very much for that.

997
00:54:33,093 --> 00:54:36,896
You talked a lot about not being afraid to refresh the brand and consider changes.

998
00:54:37,396 --> 00:54:40,859
I'm wondering what the biggest change you considered was that you ultimately stepped away from.

999
00:54:42,100 --> 00:54:43,121
The biggest change?

1000
00:54:43,141 --> 00:54:48,925
The biggest change that you considered in any aspect of each successive game that you ultimately decided was too big.

1001
00:54:52,067 --> 00:54:54,089
I think with Origin it was clearly the fight.

1002
00:54:55,581 --> 00:55:00,464
because now we were touching this second to second experience

1003
00:55:01,245 --> 00:55:04,988
which is super important because you can build a big world

1004
00:55:05,048 --> 00:55:09,211
but if you don't like your interaction with your enemies, you're screwed basically.

1005
00:55:09,632 --> 00:55:14,516
So this was a big one but it was awaited, it was needed also

1006
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:15,797
and the team was good.

1007
00:55:18,039 --> 00:55:21,541
But there is the NPC also, the AI was big.

1008
00:55:22,506 --> 00:55:26,868
The AI was big because it affected the production.

1009
00:55:27,809 --> 00:55:29,850
It affected the pipeline of it.

1010
00:55:30,930 --> 00:55:32,831
For example, in previous ACs,

1011
00:55:32,891 --> 00:55:34,992
when you go into the streets and you see,

1012
00:55:35,052 --> 00:55:37,434
I don't know, a blacksmith or somebody working,

1013
00:55:38,034 --> 00:55:40,996
well, it's, we call that a crowd station.

1014
00:55:41,136 --> 00:55:43,757
It's like a little cinematic that is placed here

1015
00:55:44,177 --> 00:55:44,998
and that won't change.

1016
00:55:45,838 --> 00:55:47,619
And so when you bumped into it,

1017
00:55:47,819 --> 00:55:49,340
they were released in the crowd flow

1018
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:50,200
and they would walk away.

1019
00:55:52,251 --> 00:55:55,312
or not move at all for the entire day.

1020
00:55:55,812 --> 00:55:58,813
With Origins, we came up with this agenda system

1021
00:55:59,213 --> 00:56:01,133
where people would sleep, eat, work,

1022
00:56:01,853 --> 00:56:04,714
and this was brand new and creating a lot of new challenges.

1023
00:56:05,514 --> 00:56:07,174
I think there is a very nice talk tomorrow

1024
00:56:07,214 --> 00:56:12,415
about debugging and making sure we reach quality.

1025
00:56:12,776 --> 00:56:15,076
With Nicolas Routier, I invite you tomorrow for that.

1026
00:56:16,176 --> 00:56:16,836
Cool, thank you.

1027
00:56:17,236 --> 00:56:17,537
You're welcome.

1028
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:25,424
Hi, I know Assassin's Creed you released some VR experiences alongside the movies.

1029
00:56:25,444 --> 00:56:32,791
I'm wondering if you were involved in any of those or if you could comment on any of the VR developments around Assassin's Creed.

1030
00:56:32,851 --> 00:56:37,436
This was more actually a part of the marketing campaign of the movie.

1031
00:56:37,957 --> 00:56:40,539
So we had nothing to do with that sadly.

1032
00:56:40,740 --> 00:56:41,500
I cannot give you a...

1033
00:56:42,301 --> 00:56:44,561
Any details about that I wasn't involved at all.

1034
00:56:44,861 --> 00:56:46,982
So none of the game assets were used?

1035
00:56:47,202 --> 00:56:48,702
Yes, this we do a lot.

1036
00:56:49,402 --> 00:56:51,983
We never hesitate to share our assets.

1037
00:56:52,003 --> 00:56:55,263
I mean, they are Ubisoft properties, so if we can help.

1038
00:56:56,703 --> 00:56:58,784
And sometimes we have very cool collaboration,

1039
00:56:58,804 --> 00:57:02,344
not only for marketing, but for museums, for example,

1040
00:57:02,364 --> 00:57:06,045
or documentaries that ask us for some visuals

1041
00:57:06,585 --> 00:57:08,165
to illustrate their things.

1042
00:57:08,245 --> 00:57:11,286
So yeah, we quite often share assets.

1043
00:57:11,862 --> 00:57:14,125
Oh wonderful, I'll speak with you about that after.

1044
00:57:16,647 --> 00:57:17,288
And your last one?

1045
00:57:17,568 --> 00:57:18,389
Yeah, okay.

1046
00:57:19,170 --> 00:57:21,672
Have you ever done the personas for your audience

1047
00:57:21,772 --> 00:57:23,974
and how you define your hardcore player,

1048
00:57:24,395 --> 00:57:26,657
mecho player and the other players?

1049
00:57:26,777 --> 00:57:31,161
And are they involved for different generation of the games?

1050
00:57:33,412 --> 00:57:39,674
Yes, the surveys I was talking about earlier help us define the type of players we have.

1051
00:57:40,875 --> 00:57:49,038
But we don't do the distinctions between hardcore players, middle, it's more about profile and

1052
00:57:49,058 --> 00:57:50,499
the way they experience the game.

1053
00:57:50,919 --> 00:57:55,961
So for example, we have the completers that really focus on doing everything, cleaning

1054
00:57:56,021 --> 00:57:59,462
the map, and it can take them a long time.

1055
00:57:59,882 --> 00:58:00,243
We have...

1056
00:58:01,306 --> 00:58:03,427
more the guys that rush the story

1057
00:58:04,127 --> 00:58:05,807
and really want to finish the narrative.

1058
00:58:06,227 --> 00:58:08,228
You have the ones that really focus on fight

1059
00:58:08,768 --> 00:58:09,889
because that's what they like.

1060
00:58:10,349 --> 00:58:13,570
Big challenges, big end game content.

1061
00:58:13,630 --> 00:58:15,830
This is why we came up with the war elephants

1062
00:58:16,471 --> 00:58:18,571
or the snakes or the Juno event,

1063
00:58:18,631 --> 00:58:21,212
I mean the trials of the god thing.

1064
00:58:22,152 --> 00:58:26,154
But this is more the way we identify our players

1065
00:58:26,774 --> 00:58:29,295
and trying to come up with things for everybody.

1066
00:58:29,958 --> 00:58:30,718
Okay, cool.

1067
00:58:30,738 --> 00:58:33,179
Last question, I'm a big fan of the Assassin's Creed.

1068
00:58:33,199 --> 00:58:36,160
I come from China, and we got history, we got Assassin.

1069
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:37,481
Have you ever thought about, you know,

1070
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:40,082
made a game on Chinese historical background

1071
00:58:40,242 --> 00:58:41,002
about Assassin's Creed?

1072
00:58:41,242 --> 00:58:42,723
I'm really looking forward for it.

1073
00:58:44,023 --> 00:58:45,444
Well, I was here to talk to you

1074
00:58:45,484 --> 00:58:47,304
about the past of the franchise.

1075
00:58:47,344 --> 00:58:50,045
The last decade, I know nothing about the future, I'm sorry.

1076
00:58:50,065 --> 00:58:51,986
Okay, very cool.

1077
00:58:52,006 --> 00:58:52,526
Okay, thanks.

1078
00:58:53,967 --> 00:58:55,227
Thank you, thank you very much.
