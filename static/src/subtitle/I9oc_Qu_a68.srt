1
00:00:06,033 --> 00:00:08,533
I'm going to be talking about building an inclusive tech lab, how we did it, and why

2
00:00:08,553 --> 00:00:11,674
you should also do it, and tips, tricks, and things that we've learned.

3
00:00:11,694 --> 00:00:13,995
But before we dive into that, let's tell you a little bit about who we are.

4
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,841
So hello, I'm Tara.

5
00:00:38,502 --> 00:00:40,643
I'm currently a Mixer Program Manager

6
00:00:40,743 --> 00:00:42,525
and also the Head of Accessibility for Mixer.

7
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:45,187
But along with Brandon, I am one of the

8
00:00:45,287 --> 00:00:48,529
Gaming and Disability Community Leads at Microsoft.

9
00:00:48,869 --> 00:00:51,832
I'm also the Co-Director of the Game Accessibility Conference

10
00:00:51,912 --> 00:00:55,014
that happens the Monday before GDC, so it just happened.

11
00:00:55,554 --> 00:00:57,576
And we're looking to expand.

12
00:00:57,596 --> 00:01:00,178
We're trying to get one in Paris later this year.

13
00:01:00,218 --> 00:01:02,299
We decided that yesterday, less than 24 hours

14
00:01:02,360 --> 00:01:03,520
after I'd done my other conference.

15
00:01:03,560 --> 00:01:05,722
They were like, but what if you did another in Europe?

16
00:01:06,283 --> 00:01:07,525
I was like, you guys are the worst.

17
00:01:07,805 --> 00:01:09,788
Please just let me calm down.

18
00:01:10,829 --> 00:01:13,113
But my background before that was in AAA game development.

19
00:01:13,914 --> 00:01:16,778
I've been in the industry for 10 years, as of St. Patrick's Day.

20
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:18,621
But enough about me.

21
00:01:19,001 --> 00:01:19,742
What about you, Brandon?

22
00:01:20,223 --> 00:01:20,343
Well.

23
00:01:21,382 --> 00:01:27,246
My name is Brandon Zahand, and I'm actually a release manager at 343 Industries, working

24
00:01:27,286 --> 00:01:28,167
on all things Halo.

25
00:01:29,247 --> 00:01:32,250
But I'm also a gaming and disability community lead at Microsoft.

26
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,012
I've been in the games industry about 15 years, but I've been working with the disability

27
00:01:36,032 --> 00:01:36,653
community about 20.

28
00:01:37,233 --> 00:01:40,916
I have a background in studying American Sign Language.

29
00:01:43,249 --> 00:01:46,011
So with that being said, what are we going to talk about today?

30
00:01:46,051 --> 00:01:49,053
Well, first, we're going to tell you how our lab even

31
00:01:49,073 --> 00:01:50,014
came into existence.

32
00:01:50,454 --> 00:01:52,676
We're going to give you a virtual tour of the lab.

33
00:01:53,357 --> 00:01:57,360
Then we're going to talk about the things that we kind of

34
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,843
learned along the way as we were making that lab, and then

35
00:02:01,263 --> 00:02:03,165
things you can do to make your own inclusive tech lab.

36
00:02:06,154 --> 00:02:08,815
So, and Tara, I'm actually gonna ask to switch with you

37
00:02:08,835 --> 00:02:10,555
because the glare on the screen is,

38
00:02:11,635 --> 00:02:13,516
woo, making reading some of these notes hard.

39
00:02:14,036 --> 00:02:18,777
So, Gaming for Everyone started in 2015 at Microsoft.

40
00:02:18,937 --> 00:02:23,598
This movement, this affirmation of the fact

41
00:02:23,638 --> 00:02:27,499
that we wanted to make gaming fun for everyone,

42
00:02:27,739 --> 00:02:32,920
regardless of race, ability, gender identification.

43
00:02:33,860 --> 00:02:35,901
And the whole.

44
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,172
The point behind Gaming for Everyone was really to build relationships.

45
00:02:40,592 --> 00:02:42,493
We wanted to build relationships with our customers.

46
00:02:43,034 --> 00:02:47,576
We wanted to build relationships with our colleagues internally at Microsoft and our partners

47
00:02:47,956 --> 00:02:54,920
to figure out how we can better understand what it means to make safe, inclusive game experiences.

48
00:02:56,702 --> 00:02:59,865
Gaming for Everyone is about taking ourselves out of our comfort zone.

49
00:03:00,966 --> 00:03:05,489
It's about looking at our products and our services through a whole new set of lenses.

50
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:09,152
And it was in that spirit which we created the Inclusive Tech Lab.

51
00:03:12,134 --> 00:03:18,359
Now it's easy to forget that between 10 to 15 percent of the world's population live

52
00:03:18,379 --> 00:03:19,480
with some form of disability.

53
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:20,601
That's staggering.

54
00:03:21,644 --> 00:03:26,570
And those disabilities vary greatly in terms of how they impact people's day-to-day lives,

55
00:03:27,010 --> 00:03:27,891
including how they game.

56
00:03:28,692 --> 00:03:34,079
So first and foremost, our goal was to bring awareness to disability, how it can be a barrier

57
00:03:34,099 --> 00:03:41,147
to gameplay, and how being excluded from gaming can have a significant impact on an individual's

58
00:03:41,207 --> 00:03:41,428
life.

59
00:03:43,952 --> 00:03:52,597
Now, once people understand what it means to be a part of that gaming and disability

60
00:03:52,637 --> 00:03:57,260
community, to understand why gaming and accessibility is important, we then have to educate them

61
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:59,662
on how to design inclusively for that community.

62
00:04:00,562 --> 00:04:03,744
To that end, we realized after many discussions...

63
00:04:04,948 --> 00:04:05,949
We needed a space.

64
00:04:06,670 --> 00:04:09,312
We needed a space dedicated to learning.

65
00:04:09,432 --> 00:04:15,158
A space dedicated to developers and community advocates that could come together and ideate

66
00:04:15,218 --> 00:04:17,260
on ways to make Xbox a place for everyone.

67
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:23,546
A space to share best practices and missteps, as well as think creatively on how we can

68
00:04:23,586 --> 00:04:28,331
make games not just accessible, but enjoyable for as many people as possible.

69
00:04:29,437 --> 00:04:34,667
A space that developers would leave energized, educated, and ready to go back to their teams

70
00:04:36,171 --> 00:04:40,479
to share their knowledge, the things they had learned, and inspire them to do great

71
00:04:40,519 --> 00:04:40,760
things.

72
00:04:43,234 --> 00:04:46,455
Now, unfortunately, being crammed in a tiny conference room

73
00:04:46,535 --> 00:04:51,976
is not really conducive to education and energizing.

74
00:04:52,577 --> 00:04:54,477
Those tend to be more draining and disheartening.

75
00:04:54,637 --> 00:04:58,198
No, I totally love all of the meetings where we all

76
00:04:58,258 --> 00:05:00,559
are sitting at a table around computers, totally

77
00:05:00,599 --> 00:05:01,619
engaged with one another.

78
00:05:01,659 --> 00:05:02,459
What are you talking about?

79
00:05:02,499 --> 00:05:03,180
I know, right?

80
00:05:03,801 --> 00:05:06,285
We wanted to try something a little different than that.

81
00:05:06,345 --> 00:05:09,229
So what we decided was we were going to create a space that was comfortable.

82
00:05:09,830 --> 00:05:12,253
It was going to facilitate creativity and community.

83
00:05:12,754 --> 00:05:18,222
And we wanted the room itself, the space itself, to exemplify inclusive design.

84
00:05:19,097 --> 00:05:21,878
Now we realize that by building out such a dedicated lab,

85
00:05:22,178 --> 00:05:26,280
we could not only ensure that we met all that criteria of education, empathy building,

86
00:05:26,660 --> 00:05:30,321
but we could also use it as an embassy for the gaming and disability community.

87
00:05:30,662 --> 00:05:35,224
A place where they could come in and feel at ease sharing their open and honest feedback with us.

88
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:38,885
And hopefully...

89
00:05:40,218 --> 00:05:43,600
By building out such a dedicated space, we could

90
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:46,261
demonstrate to the world that we were serious about being a

91
00:05:46,382 --> 00:05:49,443
leader in inclusive gaming, with the hopes that others

92
00:05:49,503 --> 00:05:52,085
would see that commitment and choose to join us.

93
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,547
So with that being said, let's show them the lab.

94
00:05:56,593 --> 00:05:59,655
All right, so when we give a tour of the Inclusive Tech Lab,

95
00:05:59,815 --> 00:06:02,536
we actually kind of have it divided into four quadrants.

96
00:06:02,957 --> 00:06:04,738
And when we go to give us a tour,

97
00:06:05,058 --> 00:06:07,119
we actually break it up into the four quadrants.

98
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,901
So I just have pictures of the four quadrants

99
00:06:09,941 --> 00:06:11,522
to go with you through today.

100
00:06:12,242 --> 00:06:16,425
So we're going to start with our inspiration wall, which

101
00:06:16,505 --> 00:06:19,066
is the first thing you see when you walk in on the left.

102
00:06:20,167 --> 00:06:22,989
So we've actually had a version of this inspiration wall

103
00:06:23,009 --> 00:06:23,209
since.

104
00:06:24,078 --> 00:06:26,841
the very beginning, before the lab was actually a lab.

105
00:06:27,541 --> 00:06:29,123
But I'll get into that a little bit later.

106
00:06:29,463 --> 00:06:34,328
So for us, it's really important to have a constant reminder of what we're doing and

107
00:06:34,428 --> 00:06:35,789
who we're doing it for.

108
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:41,995
So SpecialEffect is a charity in the UK, and they work with a lot of gamers with disability

109
00:06:42,015 --> 00:06:44,978
in building custom controllers and custom solutions for them.

110
00:06:45,899 --> 00:06:50,322
And as you can see here, these are all pictures of people that they've actually helped.

111
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:57,887
And later, if you want to come talk to me, I can share the Twitter so you can get more in-depth,

112
00:06:58,147 --> 00:06:59,668
closer visuals of what's happening here.

113
00:06:59,708 --> 00:07:01,290
But they're doing a lot of work.

114
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,430
They're cracking controllers.

115
00:07:02,450 --> 00:07:04,412
They're wiring things in real weird ways.

116
00:07:04,992 --> 00:07:05,753
It's pretty amazing.

117
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:08,434
But what's really important is there's a huge variety here.

118
00:07:08,835 --> 00:07:13,660
So for us being able to see the solutions they are coming up with lets us see the challenges

119
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,124
that they're going through and then when we can see that challenge we can try to think

120
00:07:17,164 --> 00:07:19,807
of new ways to make it easier for these guys.

121
00:07:21,042 --> 00:07:24,565
Because all they want to do is game, and we want to help them game.

122
00:07:25,085 --> 00:07:29,889
So an example kind of of this, like, what problems are they facing,

123
00:07:29,929 --> 00:07:32,952
how do we come up with a solution, is I mentioned a lot of them

124
00:07:32,992 --> 00:07:34,553
are wiring multiple controllers together.

125
00:07:34,894 --> 00:07:36,175
So what if we made that easier?

126
00:07:36,795 --> 00:07:37,116
Boom!

127
00:07:37,656 --> 00:07:38,156
Copilot!

128
00:07:38,517 --> 00:07:39,458
So Copilot is a...

129
00:07:41,588 --> 00:07:46,950
So, this is a way on Xbox where you can take two controller inputs and have them shared as one input.

130
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:55,272
So, for these guys, rather than having to wire two controllers together to operate maybe one with, you know, the left arm and one with the right foot,

131
00:07:55,572 --> 00:08:01,834
they could use Copilot and have the system do essentially the heavy lifting of wiring together.

132
00:08:01,854 --> 00:08:05,055
Now, they don't have to break their controller or wire them, or void the warranty.

133
00:08:05,495 --> 00:08:10,897
So, this was just a kind of example of how we can see their challenges and figure out how to make it easier for them.

134
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:16,592
Directly across from the inspiration wall is our demo space.

135
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:18,333
So we actually have four demos.

136
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:20,994
We have spaces for four demos.

137
00:08:21,314 --> 00:08:22,395
We have three set up right now.

138
00:08:23,135 --> 00:08:24,636
And for us, we know a lot of developers,

139
00:08:24,656 --> 00:08:27,037
I mean, almost all developers, are problem solvers.

140
00:08:27,437 --> 00:08:29,198
And once they understand what the problem is,

141
00:08:29,658 --> 00:08:30,798
and they understand the challenge,

142
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,139
they'll come up with solutions.

143
00:08:32,599 --> 00:08:34,680
So with these demo spaces, we have an opportunity

144
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:37,281
to show everyone who comes in what we're talking about.

145
00:08:37,782 --> 00:08:39,823
And it can be so much more impactful

146
00:08:39,983 --> 00:08:41,543
than just trying to describe the problem.

147
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:45,681
So these are three of the demos that we actually have right now.

148
00:08:46,081 --> 00:08:49,604
And I say right now because we do switch them up and change them from time to time.

149
00:08:50,004 --> 00:08:51,886
But I'm going to tell you about the ones we have right now.

150
00:08:52,326 --> 00:08:55,549
So on the left is the QuadStick.

151
00:08:56,189 --> 00:09:00,352
It's a 3D printed, puff and sip, Kickstarter-backed controller.

152
00:09:00,733 --> 00:09:02,354
And it's fully operated with your mouth.

153
00:09:02,794 --> 00:09:06,177
So a lot of the times we have to introduce people to the fact that

154
00:09:07,139 --> 00:09:09,542
You know, some people aren't using the standard controller,

155
00:09:09,582 --> 00:09:10,924
and some controllers that these gaming,

156
00:09:11,906 --> 00:09:14,990
these gamers are using are very different

157
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:16,332
from what we picture as a controller.

158
00:09:16,372 --> 00:09:18,595
So we have that there so people can see,

159
00:09:18,775 --> 00:09:20,237
like, you need to break your notion

160
00:09:20,257 --> 00:09:22,500
of what a controller looks like or feels like.

161
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,381
So in the middle, that's a picture of our IS-free setup.

162
00:09:27,162 --> 00:09:29,882
So the black part folds down to cover the monitor,

163
00:09:30,383 --> 00:09:33,123
and the user is able to experience and understand

164
00:09:33,163 --> 00:09:35,764
stuff like how someone may be using the narrator

165
00:09:35,824 --> 00:09:37,245
to navigate on the Xbox.

166
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:40,506
And then on the far right, that's actually our Rocket League

167
00:09:40,526 --> 00:09:42,346
demo with a custom controller setup.

168
00:09:42,646 --> 00:09:44,687
And I'll go into a little bit more detail later

169
00:09:44,727 --> 00:09:47,508
about how exactly that works, but it's another way

170
00:09:47,628 --> 00:09:49,649
to show people how to play a game with inputs

171
00:09:49,669 --> 00:09:50,629
that they're probably not used to.

172
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:55,369
And all of these stations give the lab guests a different way

173
00:09:55,429 --> 00:09:58,672
to experience games and think about how other people may

174
00:09:58,712 --> 00:09:59,393
engage with the game.

175
00:10:01,916 --> 00:10:05,660
So the third area is really our meeting space.

176
00:10:07,555 --> 00:10:24,738
And like we said earlier, we wanted to make it a warm and welcoming space because we don't want people to come in here and get bored. So it has plenty of chairs. That's actually a surface touch screen, which by the way, has like a glitter pen that you can draw with. Not that I ever derail meetings to use the glitter pen.

177
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:30,386
But it also has a microphone, it has a camera set up for remote meetings so we can connect

178
00:10:30,426 --> 00:10:32,028
with our teams in different locations.

179
00:10:32,469 --> 00:10:36,775
And by hosting meetings in the space, we're literally able to put the attendees in a position

180
00:10:36,795 --> 00:10:40,961
where they are completely surrounded by accessibility and accessibility thoughts.

181
00:10:41,544 --> 00:10:45,686
Something else that's actually pretty cool is our third party hardware test lab is off

182
00:10:45,726 --> 00:10:46,166
this room.

183
00:10:46,587 --> 00:10:50,248
So when we're hosting meetings with these third party teams, we actually do it in here.

184
00:10:50,869 --> 00:10:53,830
And so they get to see that we're dedicated to accessibility.

185
00:10:54,310 --> 00:10:58,352
And we really hope that it makes them think about what they're building in new ways and

186
00:10:58,372 --> 00:11:03,074
maybe new uses for them because we're putting them in the space to talk about their hardware.

187
00:11:03,915 --> 00:11:08,136
And we also use this space for what's called inclusive design sprints, which I'm really excited about.

188
00:11:08,836 --> 00:11:13,398
We basically will host a team and subject matter experts about whatever we're talking about

189
00:11:13,918 --> 00:11:16,419
and developers from those teams and let them learn from each other.

190
00:11:16,799 --> 00:11:22,640
And it's very inspiring for our developers because they, again, they get to see what people are doing to engage with our product,

191
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:28,322
how they're engaging with our product, and get to hear directly from the consumer the problems they're currently experiencing.

192
00:11:28,882 --> 00:11:31,804
We actually just did one for Mixer last January,

193
00:11:32,185 --> 00:11:34,967
and I was incredibly proud of the team.

194
00:11:36,808 --> 00:11:37,108
All right.

195
00:11:37,909 --> 00:11:40,911
So Tara was kind enough to let me do this slide

196
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,272
because this is one of my favorite parts of the lab,

197
00:11:43,292 --> 00:11:44,753
and that is the living room experience.

198
00:11:45,514 --> 00:11:48,136
You know, when I came to 343, it kind of hit me.

199
00:11:49,076 --> 00:11:52,859
I was sitting in front of a computer working on game development,

200
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:53,820
and I was...

201
00:11:55,343 --> 00:11:56,905
It's 18 inches away from that monitor.

202
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:58,206
But let's think about it.

203
00:11:58,246 --> 00:12:00,888
How many console gamers are actually playing 18 inches

204
00:12:00,948 --> 00:12:02,129
away from their monitors?

205
00:12:02,189 --> 00:12:02,949
Not many, right?

206
00:12:02,989 --> 00:12:05,872
I mean, the majority of console gamers are sitting in

207
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,494
their living rooms, or their bedrooms, or their caves.

208
00:12:09,655 --> 00:12:11,336
Most of us are 6 to 10 feet away.

209
00:12:11,396 --> 00:12:13,538
Actually, at my house, I'm 11 feet away from my TV.

210
00:12:14,379 --> 00:12:16,580
And we're using stereo speakers.

211
00:12:17,101 --> 00:12:18,862
We're using surround sound receivers.

212
00:12:19,883 --> 00:12:20,904
We're not using headphones.

213
00:12:21,424 --> 00:12:21,785
And so

214
00:12:22,585 --> 00:12:25,226
You know, obviously, when you're sitting farther away from the screen,

215
00:12:25,306 --> 00:12:28,066
it's going to be harder to see detail, to read text.

216
00:12:28,787 --> 00:12:30,887
But beyond that, there's other environmental factors

217
00:12:30,987 --> 00:12:33,427
that can more easily impact a living room setup.

218
00:12:34,048 --> 00:12:36,928
Glare from lighting, similar to what I just experienced earlier.

219
00:12:37,688 --> 00:12:40,849
Background noise, viewing angle, acoustic properties of the room.

220
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,209
All of those things can make it more difficult to see or hear

221
00:12:44,529 --> 00:12:46,490
what's going on in a game for everyone,

222
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,650
not just somebody with a disability.

223
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:54,012
So what we did here was, with the lab, when we set it up,

224
00:12:54,112 --> 00:12:56,293
we wanted to be able to try out all sorts of room

225
00:12:56,593 --> 00:12:57,393
configurations.

226
00:12:58,114 --> 00:13:01,095
We used adjustable lighting and furniture that can be

227
00:13:01,235 --> 00:13:02,356
easily rearranged.

228
00:13:03,276 --> 00:13:05,757
That way, we're able to ideate on ways to better deal with

229
00:13:05,777 --> 00:13:08,118
some of these typical environmental issues.

230
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:13,380
We also use this space to test out the latest and greatest

231
00:13:13,581 --> 00:13:17,082
audio visual technologies.

232
00:13:17,282 --> 00:13:19,822
Because those latest and greatest technologies often

233
00:13:19,962 --> 00:13:23,804
offer us some additional capabilities to explore as it

234
00:13:23,844 --> 00:13:25,884
relates to using them for accessibility.

235
00:13:26,304 --> 00:13:31,046
So in the picture here, what you're looking at is a 4K,

236
00:13:31,066 --> 00:13:33,407
75-inch OLED TV.

237
00:13:34,007 --> 00:13:36,188
It's hooked up to a Dolby Atmos 5.1.4 surround sound

238
00:13:36,208 --> 00:13:36,468
system.

239
00:13:39,569 --> 00:13:48,396
And not only do games and movies sound and look amazing on this system, but we've been

240
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:52,539
able to discover that there's some things we can take advantage of with those technologies

241
00:13:52,939 --> 00:13:54,560
that can make gaming much more inclusive.

242
00:13:54,741 --> 00:14:00,865
As an example, with Dolby Atmos, the ability to render audio objects in 3D.

243
00:14:02,727 --> 00:14:07,889
as they relate to the specific environment in which you're sitting in can produce a level

244
00:14:07,909 --> 00:14:14,931
of fidelity, audio fidelity, that can make audio navigation systems, audio cue systems

245
00:14:14,991 --> 00:14:20,913
for those who are visually impaired or blind incredibly accurate and helpful when dealing

246
00:14:20,993 --> 00:14:22,974
with various different types of gaming situations.

247
00:14:26,409 --> 00:14:30,011
And speaking of latest and greatest, AR, VR, MR,

248
00:14:30,171 --> 00:14:33,033
they're all incredibly exciting new technologies

249
00:14:33,173 --> 00:14:35,655
that gaming is taking a part in.

250
00:14:36,515 --> 00:14:38,777
But strategies and best practices for designing these,

251
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:41,018
there aren't a lot of them out there.

252
00:14:41,038 --> 00:14:44,701
Ian Hamilton, who's a well-known game accessibility expert,

253
00:14:44,741 --> 00:14:47,483
has written an article that covers some of this stuff.

254
00:14:47,523 --> 00:14:49,024
But there's still a lot of exploration

255
00:14:49,044 --> 00:14:50,085
going on in this space.

256
00:14:50,585 --> 00:14:52,606
So we dedicated a section of the lab

257
00:14:52,866 --> 00:14:55,268
just to VR and to future technologies.

258
00:14:56,028 --> 00:15:00,049
Now, the thing that's really important to call out here is that we have lots of products

259
00:15:00,069 --> 00:15:01,210
that aren't made by Microsoft.

260
00:15:01,770 --> 00:15:05,351
You know, of course, we have HoloLens, we have some of the AR devices we partnered on,

261
00:15:05,731 --> 00:15:08,991
but we also have an Oculus Rift, we have a PS4 VR.

262
00:15:10,312 --> 00:15:14,353
And the reason for that is we don't pretend to know, or to say, you know, we don't pretend

263
00:15:14,373 --> 00:15:19,334
that we know all the best ways to tackle all these inclusive design challenges with these

264
00:15:19,374 --> 00:15:20,094
new technologies.

265
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:25,041
It's important for us to see how our partners and our competitors are tackling those issues.

266
00:15:25,742 --> 00:15:28,827
We want to understand what the gaming and disability community believes to be the best

267
00:15:28,867 --> 00:15:30,951
practices regardless of the platform.

268
00:15:34,373 --> 00:15:35,273
So how did we get here?

269
00:15:36,914 --> 00:15:39,074
This is obviously something that didn't happen overnight.

270
00:15:39,334 --> 00:15:41,295
We didn't just wake up and have an inclusive tech lab,

271
00:15:41,415 --> 00:15:42,475
although that would have been awesome.

272
00:15:42,915 --> 00:15:44,856
And I'm sure, you know, Evelyn and Bryce over here

273
00:15:44,896 --> 00:15:47,377
would have been super excited to just wake up and it existed

274
00:15:47,437 --> 00:15:49,977
rather than all the hard work and, you know,

275
00:15:50,017 --> 00:15:51,458
legwork they had to do to make it happen.

276
00:15:52,098 --> 00:15:53,498
But it's actually a really interesting story

277
00:15:53,878 --> 00:15:55,459
on how we went from nothing to...

278
00:15:56,059 --> 00:15:57,940
A dedicated inclusive tech lab.

279
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:02,461
So this was not a straight line or a clear-cut process.

280
00:16:02,641 --> 00:16:08,003
It had a lot of growth, learning, exploration, and it definitely evolved over time.

281
00:16:08,243 --> 00:16:09,503
Like there wasn't a road map.

282
00:16:10,284 --> 00:16:15,645
Like it was, you know, the whole way like, okay, well this seems like a good idea, or

283
00:16:15,685 --> 00:16:17,566
this seems like a good idea, and learning.

284
00:16:20,057 --> 00:16:26,721
So for us, it really started with inspiration from a popular charity for gamers with disabilities.

285
00:16:27,161 --> 00:16:30,063
So AbleGamers has something called an expansion pack.

286
00:16:30,904 --> 00:16:35,547
AbleGamers teamed up with Humble Bundles, SteelSeries, ElectronicsArts, Jinx, and Corsair

287
00:16:35,567 --> 00:16:35,947
Components.

288
00:16:37,128 --> 00:16:42,032
that would be donated and installed as permanent fixtures for places like group homes, special

289
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:44,274
needs, day care facilities, and long term living centers.

290
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:49,698
And these packs were intended for facilities with multiple special needs patients.

291
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:54,621
These donation bundles included assistive technology,

292
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:57,782
specialty controllers, and of course, great video games.

293
00:16:58,422 --> 00:17:00,243
And the first expansion pack was installed

294
00:17:00,303 --> 00:17:03,864
in a pediatric specialty care unit in Hopeville, Pennsylvania,

295
00:17:03,924 --> 00:17:05,105
and it had great success.

296
00:17:05,625 --> 00:17:09,546
So they had quad sticks, they had adjoint controllers,

297
00:17:09,666 --> 00:17:13,488
which is a controller where you kind of do all the remapping

298
00:17:13,528 --> 00:17:16,089
on the hardware, switches, and so much more.

299
00:17:16,129 --> 00:17:17,089
And this really inspired us.

300
00:17:17,109 --> 00:17:20,050
It was like, how do we kind of take their expansion pack idea

301
00:17:20,911 --> 00:17:23,392
and make a space where we can teach developers using it.

302
00:17:26,034 --> 00:17:28,956
So for us, our first stab at the lab was actually

303
00:17:29,876 --> 00:17:31,578
what we now refer to as an arcade.

304
00:17:31,858 --> 00:17:35,140
So funny enough, although I wasn't a Microsoft employee at the time,

305
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:38,422
I was actually there for the first arcade.

306
00:17:38,782 --> 00:17:41,364
So every year, Microsoft has the Ability Summit.

307
00:17:41,964 --> 00:17:44,245
Which is all about accessibility and so this year in 2016

308
00:17:44,525 --> 00:17:50,667
That was the first year that game accessibility was introduced into the speaking lineup, which is actually why I was there

309
00:17:51,467 --> 00:17:57,549
So for the arcade we had a range of specialty controllers, simulators, and information. Going through the pictures here

310
00:17:57,609 --> 00:18:00,430
We had a setup made by Warfrider Engage

311
00:18:01,756 --> 00:18:04,356
So, we're going to start with the first prompt.

312
00:18:04,376 --> 00:18:07,037
So, we're going to start with the first prompt.

313
00:18:07,617 --> 00:18:11,038
We had Brandon wearing motion-restricting gloves.

314
00:18:11,418 --> 00:18:13,978
We had Bryce demonstrating the quad stick.

315
00:18:14,158 --> 00:18:16,739
He's actually playing Forza, although you can't see it in that picture.

316
00:18:16,759 --> 00:18:18,979
We had Brandon demonstrating the quad stick.

317
00:18:30,821 --> 00:18:35,389
was actually the first version of the inspiration wall, where we had all of the pictures of

318
00:18:35,489 --> 00:18:36,190
special effects.

319
00:18:36,250 --> 00:18:38,694
So that, for us, has been there since day one.

320
00:18:40,466 --> 00:18:43,168
And after the Ability Summit, the team took the setup

321
00:18:43,228 --> 00:18:45,309
and kind of did pop-up versions of it in,

322
00:18:45,850 --> 00:18:47,491
it's called the Commons, it's like where

323
00:18:48,331 --> 00:18:50,352
there's like studios, A, B, C, D,

324
00:18:50,533 --> 00:18:52,254
that have a lot of Xbox people, and then in the middle,

325
00:18:52,314 --> 00:18:53,715
there's like, essentially like a mini mall

326
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:56,276
full of restaurants, and they were just doing

327
00:18:56,316 --> 00:18:57,857
pop-up versions of it there, so while people

328
00:18:57,897 --> 00:18:59,378
were going through, they would see it.

329
00:18:59,398 --> 00:19:01,880
So it's a high-traffic area, special at launch,

330
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:04,482
and at other opportunities, but it was clear that,

331
00:19:04,962 --> 00:19:07,303
you know, this little pop-up station wasn't enough,

332
00:19:07,423 --> 00:19:09,385
like it wasn't permanent, it wasn't as strong

333
00:19:09,425 --> 00:19:09,965
as it could be.

334
00:19:11,773 --> 00:19:13,435
And then, like, we got lucky.

335
00:19:13,955 --> 00:19:15,757
What really came next was the opportunity.

336
00:19:15,877 --> 00:19:19,499
We were craving a permanent home, and we just needed a space.

337
00:19:19,940 --> 00:19:21,841
But where would we get space?

338
00:19:21,861 --> 00:19:22,382
Where would it go?

339
00:19:23,523 --> 00:19:28,086
Lucky for the team, there was actually, like, a workout area that was kind of being underutilized,

340
00:19:28,226 --> 00:19:30,828
and people were thinking of getting rid of it anyway or moving it.

341
00:19:31,469 --> 00:19:32,770
And that was our time.

342
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,471
We were like, ooh, wait, wait, wait.

343
00:19:35,543 --> 00:19:36,324
We would like a space.

344
00:19:37,906 --> 00:19:40,429
And because we had the arcade and we'd been carting it around

345
00:19:40,469 --> 00:19:43,813
the whole time, we'd basically been working to legitimize the

346
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,876
idea and the work we were doing.

347
00:19:46,477 --> 00:19:48,399
And we're like, oh, but wouldn't it be great if that

348
00:19:48,459 --> 00:19:49,901
thing we keep doing had a home?

349
00:19:50,762 --> 00:19:54,086
And it showed why it was important and why we deserve

350
00:19:54,106 --> 00:19:54,747
to have the space.

351
00:19:56,317 --> 00:19:59,860
But, you know, beyond the fact that there was a space that was opening up,

352
00:20:00,761 --> 00:20:02,802
part of it was being in the right place at the right time.

353
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:06,825
Not only has accessibility been on the rise in the games industry for the past few years,

354
00:20:06,985 --> 00:20:09,227
the dramatic increase in both features and awareness,

355
00:20:09,627 --> 00:20:11,929
there was also a culture shift happening within Microsoft.

356
00:20:13,016 --> 00:20:15,998
So in 2014, Satya Nadella became CEO for Microsoft.

357
00:20:16,358 --> 00:20:21,182
And after that, Microsoft revised its mission statement to empower every person and every

358
00:20:21,242 --> 00:20:23,904
organization on the planet to achieve more.

359
00:20:24,644 --> 00:20:26,786
But for Satya, accessibility is very personal.

360
00:20:27,266 --> 00:20:29,708
His first son has severe cerebral palsy.

361
00:20:29,728 --> 00:20:33,511
So I'm just going to quote him on Microsoft's accessibility work.

362
00:20:34,291 --> 00:20:37,333
Our work in accessibility has an incredibly deep meaning to me personally.

363
00:20:37,693 --> 00:20:42,775
Our family's experience has required me to continually hit refresh on my emotions and all my outlook.

364
00:20:43,336 --> 00:20:46,577
And it is in this constant quest for renewal that I realize,

365
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:51,880
despite the fact we are making progress, we still have much to do quickly for so many.

366
00:20:52,481 --> 00:20:56,323
And so the fact that that was how Microsoft was starting to think about accessibility,

367
00:20:56,443 --> 00:20:59,464
and we were showing up and being like, hey, hey, hey, we'd like a home,

368
00:21:00,185 --> 00:21:01,345
we got really, really lucky.

369
00:21:04,252 --> 00:21:08,735
So kind of what we were doing was fitting in line with Satya's goals, empowering everyone,

370
00:21:08,975 --> 00:21:12,357
and it also was right in line with the Gaming for Everyone commitment.

371
00:21:13,378 --> 00:21:18,222
But it does take more than just being in line with your company's ideas and messaging, right?

372
00:21:18,562 --> 00:21:23,285
So for us, we needed to get executive sponsorship, someone, you know, at the leadership level

373
00:21:23,685 --> 00:21:24,586
wanting to back us.

374
00:21:25,187 --> 00:21:27,448
And we were actually really lucky in that we got that.

375
00:21:28,649 --> 00:21:31,671
So really for the lab, like, something like that needs...

376
00:21:33,453 --> 00:21:35,554
And it needs people who care to do the legwork,

377
00:21:35,855 --> 00:21:37,656
but having support from the top down

378
00:21:37,676 --> 00:21:38,857
is also incredibly important.

379
00:21:39,317 --> 00:21:41,219
So for us, getting the executive sponsorship

380
00:21:41,279 --> 00:21:42,299
was about three things.

381
00:21:42,379 --> 00:21:44,181
So first, showing the need.

382
00:21:44,261 --> 00:21:46,583
And this is how you guys can get executive sponsorship,

383
00:21:46,603 --> 00:21:46,883
by the way.

384
00:21:47,163 --> 00:21:47,884
So showing the need.

385
00:21:48,804 --> 00:21:50,185
People were learning from the arcades,

386
00:21:50,205 --> 00:21:52,367
but the arcades weren't always around,

387
00:21:52,727 --> 00:21:54,989
and we didn't have a space to learn or explore

388
00:21:55,329 --> 00:21:56,130
because it was temporary.

389
00:21:56,150 --> 00:21:56,810
And

390
00:21:59,045 --> 00:22:03,007
We needed to show that there was a goal.

391
00:22:03,147 --> 00:22:05,448
Like there was a craving for learning

392
00:22:05,829 --> 00:22:06,889
and we wanted to innovate

393
00:22:07,249 --> 00:22:08,630
and the space would help us do that.

394
00:22:09,751 --> 00:22:11,231
But you know, it's also really important

395
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:12,312
to know how to measure success.

396
00:22:12,692 --> 00:22:14,493
And success in an inclusive tech lab

397
00:22:14,733 --> 00:22:16,013
could be so many things.

398
00:22:16,814 --> 00:22:18,575
Maybe it's the amount of people who visited the lab

399
00:22:18,955 --> 00:22:22,657
or the amount of inclusive design features that shipped

400
00:22:22,697 --> 00:22:23,797
or the number of developers

401
00:22:23,837 --> 00:22:26,258
who now know one more thing than before.

402
00:22:26,739 --> 00:22:30,140
And we kind of had to learn, you know, what is success for the lab?

403
00:22:30,160 --> 00:22:30,640
Yeah.

404
00:22:35,121 --> 00:22:36,662
So, yeah, learning.

405
00:22:36,682 --> 00:22:40,383
This whole experience has been about learning.

406
00:22:40,984 --> 00:22:44,825
And it was, it's been, you know, putting together the lab was an incredible journey.

407
00:22:46,045 --> 00:22:47,386
And the learning.

408
00:22:47,906 --> 00:22:49,829
All along the way, constantly.

409
00:22:50,750 --> 00:22:52,472
Looking back, some of those learnings,

410
00:22:53,573 --> 00:22:54,834
they seem pretty obvious now.

411
00:22:56,036 --> 00:22:59,340
Some not so much, but we want to share with you guys

412
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,484
some of those learnings so that you have a head start

413
00:23:02,524 --> 00:23:05,447
if you decide to make your own dedicated inclusive technology lab.

414
00:23:08,060 --> 00:23:12,423
All right, so this is the audience participation portion of the presentation.

415
00:23:12,523 --> 00:23:17,185
So first off, how many of you guys have seen those pregnancy simulators?

416
00:23:17,205 --> 00:23:19,947
You know the ones with the big bellies that you strap on, right?

417
00:23:20,067 --> 00:23:20,367
All right.

418
00:23:20,927 --> 00:23:23,649
Now, quick question.

419
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:29,352
Can anyone in the room who has had a baby and thinks that those simulators fully and

420
00:23:29,432 --> 00:23:33,694
accurately represent being pregnant, can you guys just raise your hand, you gals, anyone?

421
00:23:34,535 --> 00:23:34,735
No?

422
00:23:35,235 --> 00:23:35,415
No?

423
00:23:35,475 --> 00:23:35,855
Not one?

424
00:23:35,915 --> 00:23:36,356
Yeah, you see...

425
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:42,214
So if they don't, why do we have them, right?

426
00:23:42,534 --> 00:23:47,541
Well, they give us a lens by which we can try to better

427
00:23:47,561 --> 00:23:50,865
understand some of the challenges of pregnancy.

428
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:54,581
But look, it's not the same as being pregnant, right?

429
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:56,903
And the same goes for accessibility simulators.

430
00:23:57,563 --> 00:24:00,345
We have goggles in the lab to simulate visual impairment.

431
00:24:00,485 --> 00:24:02,887
We have earplugs to simulate audio impairment.

432
00:24:03,507 --> 00:24:06,769
Gloves, you saw earlier, that simulate fine motor

433
00:24:06,809 --> 00:24:07,270
impairment.

434
00:24:07,610 --> 00:24:10,592
All those things can give us a better sense of ways we might

435
00:24:10,632 --> 00:24:13,093
be able to tackle certain challenges, but they will

436
00:24:13,294 --> 00:24:16,656
never accurately reflect what it's like to have one of

437
00:24:16,696 --> 00:24:17,276
those impairments.

438
00:24:17,997 --> 00:24:22,479
So while we may use them to think creatively about product design,

439
00:24:22,859 --> 00:24:26,681
it's important to know that we never use them to validate designs.

440
00:24:27,341 --> 00:24:33,384
Validation needs to be handled by those who understand accessibility challenges firsthand.

441
00:24:33,704 --> 00:24:34,925
I can't stress this enough.

442
00:24:35,265 --> 00:24:42,008
We do not and never will role-play disabilities in our inclusive tech lab to validate products.

443
00:24:43,445 --> 00:24:48,168
Now, that wasn't something we necessarily learned when we were building the lab, but

444
00:24:48,188 --> 00:24:52,630
what we did need to learn was how to relay that message to individuals who were coming

445
00:24:52,670 --> 00:24:53,370
into the space.

446
00:24:54,031 --> 00:25:00,214
That's why we always curate our lab tours and why we have signage, like the signage

447
00:25:00,234 --> 00:25:04,116
you see above, that clearly explains this very important principle.

448
00:25:06,354 --> 00:25:11,858
So we've obviously just told you that having simulators wasn't enough.

449
00:25:12,238 --> 00:25:14,720
So we really did want to show authentic rigs.

450
00:25:15,020 --> 00:25:18,582
So we had the pictures of everything that was happening with special effect.

451
00:25:18,963 --> 00:25:23,126
And our first thought was just like, let's take that and put this here and then let people

452
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:23,406
see it.

453
00:25:25,247 --> 00:25:29,330
And our first Rocket League set up was so much more complex than the one we have now.

454
00:25:29,970 --> 00:25:32,292
We were really trying to replicate what we were seeing on the wall.

455
00:25:34,167 --> 00:25:37,250
We found out it was way too much for people.

456
00:25:37,590 --> 00:25:38,872
It was way too different.

457
00:25:40,053 --> 00:25:42,335
So if you haven't been using that stuff and then you go to use it,

458
00:25:42,575 --> 00:25:46,378
it was incredibly intimidating and people were basically in, like, shock.

459
00:25:46,659 --> 00:25:48,781
And what we were trying to say wasn't getting through

460
00:25:48,861 --> 00:25:51,963
because they were so focused on this crazy thing they hadn't seen before.

461
00:25:52,964 --> 00:25:56,948
So we really needed to back it up and make it more approachable.

462
00:25:57,068 --> 00:25:58,890
So we basically learned less is more.

463
00:26:01,516 --> 00:26:03,997
And this was the end result.

464
00:26:04,017 --> 00:26:05,778
So this is our current Rocket League station.

465
00:26:06,058 --> 00:26:07,919
So in this setup, Gas is the foot pedal

466
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:08,859
that you can see on the floor.

467
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:12,901
The player still is left and right using the two blue

468
00:26:12,941 --> 00:26:14,342
and green buttons about knee height.

469
00:26:15,002 --> 00:26:17,643
And there's the joystick on the arm,

470
00:26:17,683 --> 00:26:18,624
and that's used for jumping.

471
00:26:18,904 --> 00:26:19,344
And that's it.

472
00:26:20,965 --> 00:26:24,166
This, uh, Rocket League is an easy game with simple controls,

473
00:26:24,506 --> 00:26:27,466
and using a pedal for gas is already really natural for most people,

474
00:26:27,886 --> 00:26:30,627
so this demonstration was much easier for people to use

475
00:26:30,947 --> 00:26:33,448
and experience than what we had set up previously.

476
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:36,049
So you just have to show people the change,

477
00:26:36,069 --> 00:26:38,709
you don't have to go for the huge, crazy rigs, like,

478
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:41,750
just a little bit to kind of challenge what people are used to

479
00:26:42,210 --> 00:26:42,930
is totally enough.

480
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,213
And something else that we learned while building these crazy rigs is, although people find

481
00:26:48,233 --> 00:26:51,955
a lot of this stuff cool to look at, we actually didn't need to invest the money in it.

482
00:26:52,915 --> 00:26:56,738
So on the left is the Adroit controller, and it's made by Evil Controllers in partnership

483
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:57,418
with AbleGamers.

484
00:26:57,478 --> 00:26:58,339
I mentioned it previously.

485
00:26:58,659 --> 00:26:59,679
So that controller is $399.

486
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:04,702
A 500 gig Xbox One S is $280.

487
00:27:05,102 --> 00:27:09,825
So that controller, to play games on Xbox, is literally more expensive than the Xbox

488
00:27:09,865 --> 00:27:10,065
itself.

489
00:27:11,648 --> 00:27:14,350
And I'm not saying, to be clear, I'm not saying this is not a good product.

490
00:27:14,430 --> 00:27:17,292
And for some players, particularly on a PC, this is very, very important.

491
00:27:18,032 --> 00:27:19,613
We just found other things that we could use instead.

492
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:24,276
And this was, to call it out, this was really the first controller of its kind

493
00:27:24,336 --> 00:27:25,877
that did hardware remapping like that.

494
00:27:26,738 --> 00:27:29,980
So that was great, and the Craftsmanship was great, but we just didn't need it.

495
00:27:30,961 --> 00:27:33,702
We also have the QuadStick, the Puff and Sip controller,

496
00:27:34,042 --> 00:27:35,883
and that also costs $399,

497
00:27:35,923 --> 00:27:40,125
although there are other ones specifically made for first-person shooters

498
00:27:40,165 --> 00:27:41,325
that cost more than this one.

499
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:44,907
And that piece of technology also works fine, no problems with it.

500
00:27:45,347 --> 00:27:46,928
But it's not something we have people demo.

501
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:48,288
It's mostly there for show.

502
00:27:48,469 --> 00:27:51,850
Like, we're not going to have person after person put their mouth on this thing in the lab.

503
00:27:52,310 --> 00:27:53,091
We could have had a picture.

504
00:27:53,111 --> 00:27:56,672
Right? Like, I mean, germs. They're real.

505
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:00,751
And then finally, we also have the X keys.

506
00:28:00,911 --> 00:28:01,752
Now, don't get me wrong.

507
00:28:01,772 --> 00:28:05,354
This box actually does a lot of stuff.

508
00:28:05,434 --> 00:28:08,376
And if we're going to buy one of these items, buy that one.

509
00:28:08,416 --> 00:28:09,576
It's also the cheapest at $125.

510
00:28:09,656 --> 00:28:13,678
We just found that we haven't really

511
00:28:13,718 --> 00:28:14,819
been using it in the lab.

512
00:28:14,939 --> 00:28:17,821
So these are three things that are expensive that we purchased

513
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:19,482
that we're not doing much with.

514
00:28:21,623 --> 00:28:23,123
We could have just done it with this.

515
00:28:25,209 --> 00:28:28,750
So what we do use in the lab all the time is our modified Mayflash arcade stick.

516
00:28:29,430 --> 00:28:32,631
Ours has been modified to have additional ports on the bottom.

517
00:28:33,311 --> 00:28:37,632
The joystick itself is like $80. We paid more than that for ours

518
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:40,333
because we had someone modify it for us.

519
00:28:41,473 --> 00:28:45,354
But, lucky for you, while one switch was making ours

520
00:28:45,394 --> 00:28:48,975
he actually created a walkthrough on how you could just buy a Mayflash stick and

521
00:28:49,295 --> 00:28:52,895
edit it yourself. So that's the short link at the bottom.

522
00:28:53,095 --> 00:28:54,236
If you want to do it and go DIY.

523
00:28:55,456 --> 00:28:56,156
That's his walkthrough.

524
00:28:56,897 --> 00:29:00,259
So our arcade stick is actually what powers our Rocket League demo.

525
00:29:00,279 --> 00:29:02,780
We have all the switches just plugged into that controller.

526
00:29:06,502 --> 00:29:13,805
So switching gears a little bit, one of the reasons that accessibility experts have a

527
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:19,188
love-hate relationship with regulations, well, I'm going to give you, I'm just going to show

528
00:29:19,228 --> 00:29:19,528
you why.

529
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:24,962
So I told you we wanted to build an inclusive, accessible

530
00:29:25,182 --> 00:29:25,822
space, right?

531
00:29:25,862 --> 00:29:27,443
We wanted to make sure that our lab was

532
00:29:27,503 --> 00:29:29,163
entirely ADA compliant.

533
00:29:29,743 --> 00:29:33,685
And that included not just our demo stations, not just our

534
00:29:33,765 --> 00:29:35,886
tech, but things like the door.

535
00:29:36,286 --> 00:29:38,447
We wanted to make sure the door was ADA compliant.

536
00:29:38,927 --> 00:29:41,107
So when we did, we looked at the ADA regulations.

537
00:29:41,147 --> 00:29:43,128
We said, ah, 32 inches, fantastic.

538
00:29:43,148 --> 00:29:44,989
We're going to make our door 32 inches wide.

539
00:29:45,129 --> 00:29:45,429
So we did.

540
00:29:47,262 --> 00:29:51,243
And immediately after we started inviting community members in, we realized we had made

541
00:29:51,263 --> 00:29:52,323
a huge mistake.

542
00:29:53,023 --> 00:29:57,984
You see, the problem is that 32 inches, while being technically compliant, it's not wide

543
00:29:58,024 --> 00:29:59,205
enough for certain scenarios.

544
00:29:59,625 --> 00:30:03,746
For example, someone in a large power chair could still have difficulty navigating through

545
00:30:03,766 --> 00:30:08,367
the door, or maybe someone in a smaller chair with a service dog, or someone who was blind

546
00:30:08,387 --> 00:30:10,027
and being assisted by another individual.

547
00:30:12,288 --> 00:30:13,128
So we redid the door.

548
00:30:14,171 --> 00:30:15,611
It's now 47 inches wide.

549
00:30:15,651 --> 00:30:17,612
This is the actual, this is the after picture.

550
00:30:17,772 --> 00:30:19,373
So you can see it's 47 inches wide.

551
00:30:19,413 --> 00:30:22,013
And then we added a separate section that's about two feet

552
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:23,394
wide that we can open as needed.

553
00:30:24,834 --> 00:30:26,035
Now this is the crazy part.

554
00:30:26,335 --> 00:30:30,796
As Costco, the single one-time largest cost for us, for the

555
00:30:30,816 --> 00:30:32,277
lab, was that door.

556
00:30:33,457 --> 00:30:33,657
So.

557
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,498
It just goes to show that A, think about this

558
00:30:37,518 --> 00:30:40,039
stuff early on in your designing, and B, a

559
00:30:40,659 --> 00:30:44,040
compliant experience is not necessarily a good experience.

560
00:30:47,341 --> 00:30:49,922
Now, not only did we want a good experience,

561
00:30:49,942 --> 00:30:53,022
we wanted a fantastic experience, right. And we wanted

562
00:30:53,042 --> 00:30:55,003
to pay a lot of attention to details to

563
00:30:55,063 --> 00:30:58,784
ensure that we had a truly inclusive space.

564
00:31:00,155 --> 00:31:03,018
So we thought about things like furniture.

565
00:31:03,699 --> 00:31:06,421
We knew we'd have to rearrange furniture for demos when we

566
00:31:06,461 --> 00:31:07,922
brought in users and power chairs.

567
00:31:08,863 --> 00:31:11,426
So we picked a couch and chairs and tables that were

568
00:31:11,486 --> 00:31:12,887
light and easy to move around.

569
00:31:13,387 --> 00:31:16,310
But that being said, we also made sure that every piece of

570
00:31:16,350 --> 00:31:19,233
furniture was sturdy and stable so that you could use

571
00:31:19,253 --> 00:31:21,875
it for support if you had problems standing or walking.

572
00:31:22,779 --> 00:31:26,850
For wheelchair users, all of our demo desks have adjustable

573
00:31:26,890 --> 00:31:28,735
height, and they have no obstacles underneath.

574
00:31:28,795 --> 00:31:31,141
So people can roll right up to the stations.

575
00:31:32,478 --> 00:31:37,183
Now you'll notice that all of our chairs and couches are in bright colors.

576
00:31:37,624 --> 00:31:42,569
Now that wasn't just because we were trying to make it look pretty.

577
00:31:43,270 --> 00:31:48,075
The fact is that those different colors contrasting against the dark floor

578
00:31:48,315 --> 00:31:52,579
can make it easier for somebody with visual impairments to find a place to sit.

579
00:31:54,351 --> 00:31:59,335
In addition, other things we thought about when it came to visual impairment are information

580
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,497
sheets in the lab are printed in braille as well.

581
00:32:02,157 --> 00:32:07,202
We have a soda fridge, and in that soda fridge there's dividers that have all the cans lined

582
00:32:07,302 --> 00:32:11,205
up and the label for each type of soda is in braille as well.

583
00:32:12,626 --> 00:32:17,771
We even thought about putting in things like stands for people to place their canes while

584
00:32:17,791 --> 00:32:19,712
they were sitting and playing games.

585
00:32:20,873 --> 00:32:20,993
Now...

586
00:32:22,043 --> 00:32:25,985
For those with sensory processing considerations, we put in adjustable lighting.

587
00:32:26,886 --> 00:32:32,828
Color, temperature, brightness, it can all be adjusted to best suit individual visitors.

588
00:32:34,089 --> 00:32:38,751
And those lights are all connected to an automation system that can be controlled with voice,

589
00:32:39,471 --> 00:32:45,314
so that users who have troubles operating switches can control those more easily.

590
00:32:48,055 --> 00:32:50,636
Now all of this being said, we learned a lot.

591
00:32:51,777 --> 00:32:53,018
We still have a ton more to learn.

592
00:32:54,759 --> 00:32:58,161
That's why we're regularly bringing the community into our lab.

593
00:32:59,302 --> 00:33:03,265
We've brought in groups from a variety of NGOs, such as Cerebral Palsy Foundation, Seattle

594
00:33:03,285 --> 00:33:08,588
Children's Hospital, and they have helped us not only ideate on ways we can make gaming

595
00:33:08,608 --> 00:33:14,332
better for everyone, but how the lab can be a more inclusive and more welcoming and more

596
00:33:14,372 --> 00:33:17,454
effective space for promoting our message of inclusive game design.

597
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:22,416
It's not an exaggeration to say that every single time we've brought in the community

598
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:27,780
into the lab, we've learned something new about inclusive gaming and our inclusive tech

599
00:33:27,820 --> 00:33:28,020
lab.

600
00:33:31,211 --> 00:33:34,393
We're also still learning that there have been some unexpected benefits that we didn't

601
00:33:34,433 --> 00:33:35,733
think we would get from the lab.

602
00:33:35,833 --> 00:33:39,595
So for example, we never intended to use the lab for recruiting.

603
00:33:40,276 --> 00:33:46,459
But somehow, word got out, and recruiters heard about it, and we started getting these

604
00:33:46,499 --> 00:33:51,882
requests to bring potential recruits through the lab.

605
00:33:53,103 --> 00:33:55,025
And we were kind of surprised, asked why.

606
00:33:55,125 --> 00:33:58,309
Well, it turns out that there are a lot of people

607
00:33:58,409 --> 00:34:00,591
who are really inspired by Microsoft's new mission

608
00:34:01,012 --> 00:34:04,015
of empowering every person and every organization on the planet

609
00:34:04,035 --> 00:34:04,716
to achieve more.

610
00:34:04,736 --> 00:34:08,480
Especially millennials seem to be really intrigued by that mission.

611
00:34:09,121 --> 00:34:13,886
And our lab is a tangible representation of that commitment.

612
00:34:15,889 --> 00:34:21,615
Another cool factor that we weren't kind of expecting was the fact that the lab would

613
00:34:21,635 --> 00:34:25,098
afford us opportunities to get our message out via channels we might not otherwise get

614
00:34:25,198 --> 00:34:25,739
access to.

615
00:34:25,859 --> 00:34:30,164
So, for example, we've had opportunities to partner with organizations like GameStop to

616
00:34:30,184 --> 00:34:34,008
highlight the space and bring broad awareness to the need for gaming and accessibility.

617
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:39,533
This screenshot was a video that was put together for GameStop TV.

618
00:34:40,233 --> 00:34:45,338
It features Bryce and Evelyn, who were the masterminds behind our lab.

619
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:48,761
And this has been featured in over 7,000 retail stores.

620
00:34:49,121 --> 00:34:53,105
So, wow, what an amazing way to get our word out that we never thought we would have.

621
00:34:54,617 --> 00:34:58,779
So now that you've seen our lab and how it came to be and what we learned in the process,

622
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:03,241
I know all of you are like, oh my God, I'm ready to go make my own lab right now.

623
00:35:03,641 --> 00:35:04,681
All right, we got you.

624
00:35:05,722 --> 00:35:10,284
So that being said, we know not every budget is created equal, and so we kind of have tips

625
00:35:10,304 --> 00:35:16,867
and tricks on how you can replicate what we've done based on, you know, the different resources

626
00:35:16,887 --> 00:35:17,687
you may have available.

627
00:35:17,707 --> 00:35:22,169
So we're going to kind of talk about small or non-existent, medium and large budgets

628
00:35:22,269 --> 00:35:22,550
today.

629
00:35:23,706 --> 00:35:27,209
So look, if you don't have the budget for a dedicated space,

630
00:35:27,309 --> 00:35:28,951
or you're just in a really small space,

631
00:35:29,391 --> 00:35:31,554
you can do what we initially did and put together

632
00:35:31,574 --> 00:35:32,715
accessibility arcades.

633
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:35,417
As mentioned, they're temporary pop-ups

634
00:35:35,858 --> 00:35:37,860
of assistive tech and educational materials

635
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,241
that can be used to educate folks

636
00:35:39,281 --> 00:35:41,263
on the basic concepts of gaming and disability.

637
00:35:41,944 --> 00:35:46,127
Now, again, they aren't ideal, as you won't get all the benefits of the lab,

638
00:35:46,328 --> 00:35:51,652
especially that notion of having an embassy to bring the gaming and disability community

639
00:35:51,772 --> 00:35:53,694
into to introduce to your development teams.

640
00:35:54,315 --> 00:35:58,178
But they can be a good place to start if you can't secure a permanent location for your

641
00:35:58,218 --> 00:35:58,458
lab.

642
00:35:59,719 --> 00:36:01,881
So, you're going the arcade route.

643
00:36:03,402 --> 00:36:05,224
Again, I want to reiterate what he just said.

644
00:36:05,544 --> 00:36:07,186
Don't worry if you can't make a full lab.

645
00:36:07,686 --> 00:36:09,708
Having just an arcade can be fine.

646
00:36:10,188 --> 00:36:12,070
And don't worry, I have been there.

647
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:15,793
So before I was with Microsoft, I was working with Gaikai,

648
00:36:16,233 --> 00:36:19,276
which is the cloud services division of PlayStation.

649
00:36:19,957 --> 00:36:22,839
And I made an arcade with practically no money

650
00:36:22,879 --> 00:36:25,241
and just wrangling up literally whatever I could find

651
00:36:25,341 --> 00:36:26,222
at home or in the office.

652
00:36:26,883 --> 00:36:28,804
So let's talk about ways you can do that and be successful.

653
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:34,143
So when I worked at GuyKai, I didn't have a budget, but I had people who were interested

654
00:36:34,463 --> 00:36:38,669
in accessibility and a special occasion, Global Accessibility Awareness Day.

655
00:36:39,270 --> 00:36:42,955
And I made this little mini lab based on what I could find in the office.

656
00:36:43,056 --> 00:36:44,117
So what did I do?

657
00:36:44,137 --> 00:36:44,177
So...

658
00:36:45,979 --> 00:36:48,361
We had PS4s, we're part of PlayStation, so that was pretty simple,

659
00:36:49,302 --> 00:36:51,464
and a copy of Uncharted, a hugely popular game.

660
00:36:51,524 --> 00:36:56,147
So Uncharted has a whole accessibility menu with tons of assistive features,

661
00:36:56,828 --> 00:36:59,830
and I had a pair of the vision-simulating goggles,

662
00:37:00,131 --> 00:37:01,872
which, by the way, you can totally make on your own.

663
00:37:01,892 --> 00:37:04,554
There are tutorials where you can basically take some welding goggles

664
00:37:04,614 --> 00:37:07,877
and some, like, saran wrap and make them yourselves for cheaper

665
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:09,238
if you don't have the money to buy them.

666
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:15,702
So I had a stand that literally had Uncharted and its assistive features and some goggles to try to get people going.

667
00:37:16,963 --> 00:37:19,004
I also just reached out to some other people.

668
00:37:19,064 --> 00:37:20,865
So I mentioned Warfighter Engaged earlier.

669
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:23,226
I just emailed them and I'm like, hey, I'm doing this event.

670
00:37:23,954 --> 00:37:25,034
Do you have anything I can show off?

671
00:37:25,375 --> 00:37:26,355
And they're like, yeah, sure.

672
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:27,475
And they sent me controllers.

673
00:37:27,895 --> 00:37:32,037
I also had another specialty game rig set up from another

674
00:37:32,077 --> 00:37:35,358
charity called Game Changer, which helps children game

675
00:37:35,398 --> 00:37:36,738
during long-term hospital stays.

676
00:37:37,718 --> 00:37:39,099
I also got a guest speaker.

677
00:37:39,219 --> 00:37:43,720
So there was a Twitch streamer named Handy, who has no arms

678
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,241
or legs, but plays first-person shooters.

679
00:37:45,261 --> 00:37:45,921
And he was local.

680
00:37:46,001 --> 00:37:48,202
And I was like, hey, I would love for you, while I'm

681
00:37:48,222 --> 00:37:49,822
setting this up, just come and talk.

682
00:37:50,282 --> 00:37:52,544
Like, just tell your story.

683
00:37:53,524 --> 00:37:54,325
Again, that was free.

684
00:37:54,565 --> 00:37:56,966
When he came, like, I was like, I can't pay you,

685
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,987
but here's, like, all the swag I can find in the office

686
00:37:59,008 --> 00:37:59,468
to give out.

687
00:38:00,348 --> 00:38:01,809
Like, and that worked.

688
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,752
We also set up a colorblind station with two iPads.

689
00:38:05,812 --> 00:38:07,192
So in that picture is Ezra.

690
00:38:07,252 --> 00:38:10,014
He's one of our programmers who is actually colorblind.

691
00:38:10,174 --> 00:38:11,515
And he ran into problems all the time

692
00:38:11,675 --> 00:38:14,077
because even our internal tools didn't always

693
00:38:14,257 --> 00:38:15,137
have a colorblind mode.

694
00:38:15,578 --> 00:38:19,020
So we took my iPad and then my husband's iPad,

695
00:38:20,461 --> 00:38:23,305
On the bottom one, we had some puzzle game going.

696
00:38:23,465 --> 00:38:26,850
And on the top one, we had a colorblind filter.

697
00:38:26,950 --> 00:38:31,656
And so we were basically telling people to play the game looking through the top one.

698
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:32,778
And they'd be like, well, I can't play it.

699
00:38:32,798 --> 00:38:34,760
And I'm like, right, that's Ezra's life all the time.

700
00:38:34,780 --> 00:38:35,681
Now you get it.

701
00:38:37,463 --> 00:38:39,144
So we also had two laptops that were running,

702
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:42,825
and basically what we did was we were having people race

703
00:38:42,905 --> 00:38:46,646
to try to get on the company Wi-Fi using the screen reader.

704
00:38:47,126 --> 00:38:47,626
Like, that was it.

705
00:38:48,766 --> 00:38:50,186
It was actually a really popular station,

706
00:38:50,206 --> 00:38:52,347
because most game devs are gamers,

707
00:38:52,367 --> 00:38:53,187
and therefore competitive.

708
00:38:53,767 --> 00:38:54,707
So people wanted to win.

709
00:38:55,628 --> 00:38:57,768
And then I had all of the information materials

710
00:38:58,028 --> 00:38:58,748
I could find.

711
00:38:58,808 --> 00:39:00,409
Anything that was out there, I just printed it up,

712
00:39:00,849 --> 00:39:01,929
and I left it on the table.

713
00:39:02,369 --> 00:39:04,610
And so all of this, it was like $100.

714
00:39:04,650 --> 00:39:05,030
And some of it is.

715
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:08,592
Got out of my pocket, right?

716
00:39:08,692 --> 00:39:10,614
Other than like the free swag I stole from the office.

717
00:39:11,455 --> 00:39:13,897
So, you know, we have this great day

718
00:39:14,738 --> 00:39:16,340
where I had a lot of people come up to me

719
00:39:16,380 --> 00:39:17,341
and tell me how much they learned

720
00:39:18,162 --> 00:39:19,904
and I didn't really spend any money.

721
00:39:20,024 --> 00:39:21,125
So it can be done.

722
00:39:21,886 --> 00:39:24,829
You have tons of stuff I am sure in your office

723
00:39:25,309 --> 00:39:27,011
that you can repurpose for just a day.

724
00:39:28,417 --> 00:39:28,997
Absolutely.

725
00:39:29,137 --> 00:39:29,677
And you know what?

726
00:39:30,057 --> 00:39:32,057
If you don't have something, ask for it.

727
00:39:32,457 --> 00:39:32,917
Seriously.

728
00:39:33,318 --> 00:39:35,638
We didn't have an unlimited budget when we built our lab.

729
00:39:36,218 --> 00:39:38,398
And look, chances are you're not going to either.

730
00:39:38,979 --> 00:39:41,679
But we were incredibly fortunate that we have these

731
00:39:41,739 --> 00:39:45,260
amazing partners that we work with that do peripherals, that

732
00:39:45,300 --> 00:39:47,940
do televisions, that do audio systems.

733
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,341
And we just reached out to them and said, look, we're

734
00:39:50,361 --> 00:39:51,061
doing this thing.

735
00:39:51,281 --> 00:39:52,461
And we've got a finite budget.

736
00:39:52,541 --> 00:39:55,242
And it'd really do a lot for us if you could help us out

737
00:39:55,302 --> 00:39:56,842
and showcase some of your equipment here.

738
00:39:57,842 --> 00:40:00,623
And at the same time we could use it to help demonstrate accessibility features.

739
00:40:00,903 --> 00:40:02,704
And people said yes in droves.

740
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:08,705
And it's really cool because not only do we get the win of having that, you know,

741
00:40:08,725 --> 00:40:10,086
being able to put our budget somewhere else,

742
00:40:10,406 --> 00:40:18,228
but then those people get to show off their equipment in a really, really cool sort of way.

743
00:40:18,988 --> 00:40:22,109
I cannot tell you the number of times people have left the lab going,

744
00:40:22,629 --> 00:40:25,610
oh my god, I need to have a Dolby Atmos system at home.

745
00:40:26,404 --> 00:40:28,226
To the demo we do with the Dolby is like.

746
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:29,194
Amazing.

747
00:40:29,254 --> 00:40:29,755
I know, right?

748
00:40:29,935 --> 00:40:31,095
I've been trying to convince my wife.

749
00:40:31,436 --> 00:40:33,377
I'm not, no luck so far.

750
00:40:34,117 --> 00:40:37,759
But it's not just donating equipment, it's donating time as well.

751
00:40:38,139 --> 00:40:40,841
I mean, as an example, our lab is run by volunteers.

752
00:40:41,862 --> 00:40:47,925
We handle scheduling of the space, we prep for events, we manage the tours, we give presentations,

753
00:40:47,965 --> 00:40:49,906
we keep all the demos and documents up to date.

754
00:40:50,867 --> 00:40:52,388
It is a ton of work, I'm not gonna lie.

755
00:40:52,708 --> 00:40:56,130
But there's five of us volunteering, so between it, we're able to handle it.

756
00:40:58,411 --> 00:41:03,674
It's also just a great opportunity to educate people as well.

757
00:41:03,814 --> 00:41:06,336
As people volunteer, not all of our volunteers

758
00:41:06,436 --> 00:41:08,177
started out being accessibility experts.

759
00:41:08,237 --> 00:41:10,479
But there were people who were curious to learn more,

760
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:13,441
and now they've grown their knowledge and their area of expertise

761
00:41:13,541 --> 00:41:14,621
by working in the lab.

762
00:41:15,022 --> 00:41:17,103
So again, don't be worried if you don't have money

763
00:41:17,163 --> 00:41:18,864
for a dedicated lab manager.

764
00:41:20,700 --> 00:41:23,762
But maybe you do have some money, not all the money, but some money.

765
00:41:25,403 --> 00:41:28,365
You need to be smart about where you're going to be spending it then.

766
00:41:29,165 --> 00:41:34,688
And to be honest, we really recommend that you spend it on PC and PC accessories, as

767
00:41:34,708 --> 00:41:37,710
this is where most of this technology is working best currently.

768
00:41:38,110 --> 00:41:40,092
So if you're going to purchase these items, again,

769
00:41:40,593 --> 00:41:44,796
don't dive into buying the most expensive, fancy custom stuff.

770
00:41:45,137 --> 00:41:47,599
Just get something like the Mayflash,

771
00:41:47,999 --> 00:41:50,101
do the DIY updates, and, you know,

772
00:41:50,121 --> 00:41:51,982
get some simple switches for it.

773
00:41:53,186 --> 00:41:59,030
And if you're going to have issues pitching this space as a standalone lab, think of someone

774
00:41:59,050 --> 00:42:00,071
you could be a roomie with.

775
00:42:00,652 --> 00:42:04,274
It would be totally reasonable to share the space with some user researchers.

776
00:42:05,175 --> 00:42:06,216
Sharing is OK.

777
00:42:06,456 --> 00:42:07,056
That's fine.

778
00:42:07,436 --> 00:42:11,139
And if you're making an accessible space, think, you could then have play testers with

779
00:42:11,159 --> 00:42:12,060
disabilities come in.

780
00:42:13,341 --> 00:42:14,382
user research.

781
00:42:14,422 --> 00:42:15,343
So, win-win, right?

782
00:42:16,204 --> 00:42:20,308
And another good thing to invest in is, really, a nice set of headphones, if you're not going

783
00:42:20,328 --> 00:42:21,489
to get the Dolby system.

784
00:42:22,190 --> 00:42:24,952
You're probably not going to get that, right off the bat.

785
00:42:25,593 --> 00:42:30,057
But you want to make sure that you can replicate stereo sound experiences as well, for those

786
00:42:31,138 --> 00:42:33,941
who have low vision or are perhaps blind.

787
00:42:35,665 --> 00:42:40,467
And finally, find some great examples of media on what you

788
00:42:40,487 --> 00:42:41,628
want to teach people about.

789
00:42:42,048 --> 00:42:44,630
We're lucky enough that we have multiple demo stations.

790
00:42:45,210 --> 00:42:46,691
You may not be, and that's OK.

791
00:42:46,751 --> 00:42:50,413
Sometimes finding a video, a pamphlet, any of that, and

792
00:42:50,473 --> 00:42:53,915
having it kind of shovel-ready to show people is all you're

793
00:42:54,195 --> 00:42:54,895
going to need.

794
00:42:56,556 --> 00:42:56,876
All right.

795
00:42:57,136 --> 00:42:57,857
Well, let's say.

796
00:42:58,932 --> 00:43:00,253
You just got a whole bunch of money.

797
00:43:01,133 --> 00:43:01,973
I don't know where it came from.

798
00:43:02,173 --> 00:43:02,834
You're not asking.

799
00:43:03,494 --> 00:43:03,934
You've got it.

800
00:43:04,174 --> 00:43:04,694
Let's spend it.

801
00:43:05,054 --> 00:43:10,276
OK, so the first two, we kept debating on which we

802
00:43:10,316 --> 00:43:12,017
wanted to have first.

803
00:43:12,377 --> 00:43:15,458
Whether it should be make this a meeting space or hire staff

804
00:43:15,498 --> 00:43:18,239
for the lab, I eventually just gave up debating

805
00:43:18,279 --> 00:43:19,199
and left it as is.

806
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,000
So invest in making this a meeting space.

807
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:27,845
As I've said previously, being able to bring people in and have them have ideas and a place

808
00:43:27,885 --> 00:43:32,208
that they can talk to their people, and like I said, even bringing in people who maybe

809
00:43:32,328 --> 00:43:35,891
aren't there to talk to us about accessibility that we're just like, oh, the only meeting

810
00:43:35,931 --> 00:43:38,994
room that was open is our inclusive tech lab.

811
00:43:39,894 --> 00:43:40,495
That's awesome.

812
00:43:40,715 --> 00:43:41,436
And that's a win.

813
00:43:42,216 --> 00:43:49,262
So any money you can dump into getting a camera, a great audio setup for Skype calls or whatever,

814
00:43:49,662 --> 00:43:50,243
do that.

815
00:43:52,507 --> 00:44:04,111
The like I said the other thing is really important is like if you can hire even a person to run the lab invest in it like I said so it takes us 5 volunteers to keep the lab like running and.

816
00:44:05,032 --> 00:44:14,395
We're constantly stretched super thin so like everyone has a meeting on Monday or like OK these are the events in the lab that's happening like who can do it today and we're all just like.

817
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:21,698
I don't know and even just managing the calendar for the lab is super hard because like.

818
00:44:22,258 --> 00:44:23,920
We're so popular.

819
00:44:25,521 --> 00:44:27,484
But it's almost a problem.

820
00:44:27,644 --> 00:44:30,527
We're almost too popular for our volunteers to be able to handle.

821
00:44:30,827 --> 00:44:34,131
And I think if you guys make a space, hopefully you'd have the same problem.

822
00:44:36,135 --> 00:44:37,337
Literally hiring someone.

823
00:44:38,598 --> 00:44:43,444
The other thing is like having multiple demo stations is great, especially if you have

824
00:44:43,644 --> 00:44:45,046
multiple people going through the lab.

825
00:44:45,066 --> 00:44:49,731
You can have people doing different things at the same time, and it really keeps people

826
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:50,212
engaged.

827
00:44:50,833 --> 00:44:55,478
And the next one is making conscious decisions about your space.

828
00:44:56,379 --> 00:45:08,877
You know, we invested in making our door better, you know, figuring out like, oh, well, this carpet maybe is really hard for wheelchairs for some reason, like spending the money to make the room a better place.

829
00:45:10,746 --> 00:45:14,089
And that kind of leads into the idea of like ADA compliance plus plus.

830
00:45:14,129 --> 00:45:18,534
Like we said that, you know, compliant isn't always a good experience.

831
00:45:18,574 --> 00:45:22,217
And so if you have the money to go beyond, like invest in it,

832
00:45:22,578 --> 00:45:29,244
it means so much to have a space that everyone can truly be in and be comfortable.

833
00:45:29,264 --> 00:45:31,807
Because that's not always something that happens all the time.

834
00:45:33,649 --> 00:45:37,991
The next one, like, if you can manage to get the Dolby, like, get it.

835
00:45:39,352 --> 00:45:42,594
We had a slide earlier when Brandon was presenting of the living room space,

836
00:45:42,874 --> 00:45:46,236
and on the couch was a guy named Sightless Combat.

837
00:45:46,897 --> 00:45:50,879
He is a blind gamer who was actually playing Killer Instinct in that,

838
00:45:51,199 --> 00:45:55,742
and he was able to play in that room because of our awesome sound system.

839
00:45:56,442 --> 00:46:01,427
And so you can actually enable a lot of experiences for people with low or no vision by having

840
00:46:01,547 --> 00:46:02,929
truly awesome surround sound.

841
00:46:03,309 --> 00:46:07,333
So like, yeah, it is super cool, but it's also super useful for the space.

842
00:46:07,693 --> 00:46:08,654
So invest in it.

843
00:46:09,812 --> 00:46:12,414
And then the final thing is decor.

844
00:46:13,475 --> 00:46:14,996
We have a really sexy room.

845
00:46:15,556 --> 00:46:17,918
GameStop filmed in there because it looks awesome.

846
00:46:18,059 --> 00:46:19,860
We have other media stuff that gets filmed in there,

847
00:46:20,080 --> 00:46:22,642
which means more people see it because the space looks great.

848
00:46:23,083 --> 00:46:26,305
So if you have that extra money, make it sexy.

849
00:46:26,566 --> 00:46:27,406
People want to use it.

850
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:33,581
And I really can't understate how great the lab has been.

851
00:46:33,601 --> 00:46:35,601
The inclusive design sprints have taught

852
00:46:35,961 --> 00:46:36,962
so many teams so much.

853
00:46:37,342 --> 00:46:39,442
And this is actually a picture from Mixers

854
00:46:39,462 --> 00:46:40,482
that we did last January.

855
00:46:40,782 --> 00:46:42,143
And I was so proud of my team.

856
00:46:42,683 --> 00:46:44,463
But what I saw happening with my team

857
00:46:44,823 --> 00:46:45,844
is happening with other teams.

858
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:48,024
And it's gonna keep happening with more and more teams.

859
00:46:48,404 --> 00:46:50,445
And we're building stronger bonds with the community

860
00:46:50,765 --> 00:46:53,385
and has really helped us show that we care

861
00:46:53,585 --> 00:46:54,806
as Xbox and Microsoft.

862
00:46:54,826 --> 00:46:55,806
We care about this community.

863
00:46:56,266 --> 00:46:58,066
And it gives us a place to focus on the feedback

864
00:46:58,086 --> 00:46:58,707
that we've been giving.

865
00:46:59,587 --> 00:47:02,608
And, you know, what we've made and what we have coming

866
00:47:02,949 --> 00:47:05,490
that originates from or around this lab,

867
00:47:05,510 --> 00:47:09,132
like, I can't wait to see those ideas go live.

868
00:47:09,772 --> 00:47:11,573
And funny enough, we actually have some,

869
00:47:11,693 --> 00:47:13,894
like, when I'm talking about so much has happened,

870
00:47:13,934 --> 00:47:15,275
like, we have some data on that.

871
00:47:16,416 --> 00:47:18,457
Yeah, so for those of you

872
00:47:18,597 --> 00:47:21,498
who are a bit more data-oriented, like myself,

873
00:47:22,319 --> 00:47:23,719
these numbers, I think, are really helpful

874
00:47:23,759 --> 00:47:25,220
in showing the promise of a tech lab.

875
00:47:26,482 --> 00:47:32,188
In five months, just five months, we've had over 3,400 individuals come and visit our

876
00:47:32,228 --> 00:47:35,211
lab to learn about inclusive game design and accessibility.

877
00:47:35,671 --> 00:47:42,237
Now 61% of those were visitors from internal at Microsoft, designers, producers, executives.

878
00:47:42,578 --> 00:47:46,482
We've even had members from our other core businesses such as Windows and Office come

879
00:47:46,502 --> 00:47:47,242
by and take a look.

880
00:47:47,903 --> 00:47:52,726
Our teams are drawn by that unique experience the lab provides and the opportunity to ask

881
00:47:52,786 --> 00:47:56,329
really tough design questions in a safe, comfortable environment.

882
00:47:57,489 --> 00:48:02,273
Everyone always comes away better educated about our gaming and disability community,

883
00:48:02,593 --> 00:48:05,395
how to engage them, and the best ways to meet their needs.

884
00:48:06,235 --> 00:48:10,798
Now, 39% of our visitors, that means, are external to Microsoft.

885
00:48:10,818 --> 00:48:16,021
So that's, again, NGOs, advocacy organizations, academics, business partners.

886
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:21,324
Even local school groups have come by to tour the lab and to collaborate on ways we can

887
00:48:21,364 --> 00:48:23,406
make our gaming more inclusive.

888
00:48:24,486 --> 00:48:27,169
Not just at Microsoft, but across the entire industry.

889
00:48:27,849 --> 00:48:29,851
And regardless of whatever we're doing in the lab,

890
00:48:29,871 --> 00:48:32,893
whether it's a tour, a video shoot, a design meeting,

891
00:48:33,193 --> 00:48:36,296
or even just a party, our goal is always the same.

892
00:48:36,596 --> 00:48:38,498
Let's educate, let's build empathy,

893
00:48:38,878 --> 00:48:41,980
and grow and support our gaming and disability community.

894
00:48:43,522 --> 00:48:45,003
So, with that being said,

895
00:48:46,984 --> 00:48:49,947
our one ask, come visit us, okay?

896
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:51,528
Our lab is public. Please.

897
00:48:52,365 --> 00:48:53,426
Doesn't matter who you work for.

898
00:48:55,267 --> 00:48:58,169
Doesn't matter if you're within the industry or you're

899
00:48:58,889 --> 00:48:59,970
with an advocacy group.

900
00:49:00,250 --> 00:49:01,210
We just want you to come.

901
00:49:01,530 --> 00:49:02,091
Visit the lab.

902
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:02,711
Check it out.

903
00:49:03,612 --> 00:49:05,152
We'll share best practices.

904
00:49:05,813 --> 00:49:06,853
Let's find ways to partner.

905
00:49:07,334 --> 00:49:09,835
Let's ensure that gaming for everyone is just that.

906
00:49:10,876 --> 00:49:14,458
Gaming for everyone, regardless of how you play, where

907
00:49:14,498 --> 00:49:18,340
you play, what platform you play on, and what abilities

908
00:49:18,380 --> 00:49:19,580
or disabilities you may have.

909
00:49:20,901 --> 00:49:21,461
So with that...

910
00:49:23,375 --> 00:49:25,596
Let's take some questions.

911
00:49:31,097 --> 00:49:34,278
We have a microphone right here.

912
00:49:34,618 --> 00:49:36,078
And since we're being recorded, if you have an

913
00:49:36,158 --> 00:49:39,399
opportunity to ask a question, please come up to the mic.

914
00:49:41,940 --> 00:49:43,320
Did we really do that good of a job?

915
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:44,140
No one has questions.

916
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:45,961
I knew it.

917
00:49:46,001 --> 00:49:46,741
We explained everything.

918
00:49:47,781 --> 00:49:48,841
Oh, we've got one.

919
00:49:49,841 --> 00:49:50,182
All right.

920
00:49:52,745 --> 00:49:53,405
Two things actually.

921
00:49:54,266 --> 00:49:55,766
In terms of doing it the cheap way,

922
00:49:55,806 --> 00:49:59,887
some other things to look at are artist and actually quilting

923
00:49:59,927 --> 00:50:02,687
tools for the grayscale capability.

924
00:50:03,307 --> 00:50:05,888
So they're tools that they're basically

925
00:50:06,368 --> 00:50:09,768
clear plastic, green-red filters,

926
00:50:10,268 --> 00:50:11,909
that when you put them on top of something,

927
00:50:12,489 --> 00:50:15,529
it causes it to look like colorblindness.

928
00:50:16,369 --> 00:50:18,630
It's actually used by artists for grayscale

929
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,010
to balance artwork.

930
00:50:22,043 --> 00:50:23,905
Digital artists tend to not be aware of it.

931
00:50:23,945 --> 00:50:25,046
They tend not to use it.

932
00:50:25,186 --> 00:50:26,147
Physical artists do.

933
00:50:26,187 --> 00:50:26,987
So that's another thing.

934
00:50:27,008 --> 00:50:28,929
You can go to a quilting store, you can go to Joann's,

935
00:50:28,949 --> 00:50:30,751
you can go to my favorite place,

936
00:50:30,771 --> 00:50:32,652
which I'm not wearing today, is amazon.com,

937
00:50:33,413 --> 00:50:35,154
and pick up those kind of tools.

938
00:50:35,795 --> 00:50:37,236
The other thing, yeah, so it's,

939
00:50:37,536 --> 00:50:38,897
they're 20 bucks, something like that,

940
00:50:38,917 --> 00:50:40,058
so they're real cheap,

941
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:41,960
and it's real easy to set up in a lab.

942
00:50:42,460 --> 00:50:44,061
The other thing you can do is also,

943
00:50:45,282 --> 00:50:47,564
statically, use your phone, take a picture,

944
00:50:47,724 --> 00:50:49,486
and then use the grayscale out of the photo app.

945
00:50:50,096 --> 00:50:53,178
I think that's very similar to when I was showing the

946
00:50:54,199 --> 00:50:58,342
what I did at PlayStation. Essentially, I had that app running in real time

947
00:50:58,682 --> 00:51:02,004
in an iPad with the other one under it doing the same thing. Because for me it was really

948
00:51:02,044 --> 00:51:06,067
important to have people try to play the game rather than

949
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:09,629
just seeing a picture. I can show you a picture and be like, ah, which one would you move?

950
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:13,972
But then the experience of watching people actually trying to play when

951
00:51:13,992 --> 00:51:16,414
they couldn't see the colors, it was more impactful than just...

952
00:51:16,814 --> 00:51:18,115
Here's a picture of what this game looks like.

953
00:51:18,135 --> 00:51:21,298
But, I mean, you bring up such fantastic points, right?

954
00:51:21,358 --> 00:51:23,600
Like, the fact of the matter is you don't need to go invest

955
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:26,482
in some $500 colorblind simulator, right,

956
00:51:26,802 --> 00:51:28,364
to start educating people.

957
00:51:28,584 --> 00:51:31,987
There's really great tips and tricks that you can do.

958
00:51:32,427 --> 00:51:35,269
I mean, I never even thought about, you know,

959
00:51:35,289 --> 00:51:36,651
getting those filters from Joanne's.

960
00:51:37,131 --> 00:51:38,152
My wife goes there all the time.

961
00:51:38,172 --> 00:51:40,173
I'll be attending her next visit,

962
00:51:40,253 --> 00:51:41,214
so that's fantastic.

963
00:51:41,875 --> 00:51:43,517
I'll look completely clueless, but I'm sure...

964
00:51:43,537 --> 00:51:46,159
I'm a carrier. Both my kids are colorblind. My dad was colorblind.

965
00:51:46,179 --> 00:51:46,239
Wow.

966
00:51:46,339 --> 00:51:48,181
So I've had to live with it my whole life.

967
00:51:48,922 --> 00:51:51,925
The other piece is, can you talk about the curb cut effect?

968
00:51:52,326 --> 00:51:57,150
How has this changed the games of the teams that have gone through this?

969
00:51:57,791 --> 00:51:59,952
and actually resulted in improvements for all players.

970
00:52:00,032 --> 00:52:00,432
Wow.

971
00:52:00,492 --> 00:52:02,453
Because that's really where the payoff is, right?

972
00:52:02,493 --> 00:52:02,813
Because...

973
00:52:03,313 --> 00:52:03,874
Oh, yeah. Go ahead.

974
00:52:03,894 --> 00:52:06,735
I was going to say, that's really where the payoff is for the broader audience,

975
00:52:06,755 --> 00:52:11,177
because I struggle with convincing my leadership that we need to go do these things

976
00:52:11,337 --> 00:52:14,278
until you can prove to them that, like, all players benefit.

977
00:52:14,788 --> 00:52:18,931
Well, so I'm going to let you take this, but one of the cool stats that actually came out

978
00:52:18,971 --> 00:52:22,633
at the Game Accessibility Conference is everyone has this idea that, oh, accessibility features

979
00:52:22,713 --> 00:52:24,574
are only for gamers with disabilities.

980
00:52:24,594 --> 00:52:31,499
So it's like, well, for Assassin's Creed Origins, they actually showed the data that was something

981
00:52:31,519 --> 00:52:34,180
like 63% of players were playing with subtitles on.

982
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:40,284
I'm not a statistician, but I feel like 63% of the people playing that game were not deaf.

983
00:52:40,844 --> 00:52:41,145
I don't know.

984
00:52:43,644 --> 00:52:44,025
Not right.

985
00:52:44,265 --> 00:52:47,730
But that's just showing that there are more people using these features.

986
00:52:48,831 --> 00:52:54,299
But yeah, no, we've definitely had ideas and things we've done in the games that we can show.

987
00:52:54,359 --> 00:52:58,985
Well, and Tara can talk about Mixer, but since that's not technically a game, I thought I might talk about it.

988
00:52:59,005 --> 00:53:03,787
I'm going to talk about it from my experience working at 343 and with other game studios.

989
00:53:04,187 --> 00:53:06,608
We do these inclusive design sprints.

990
00:53:06,968 --> 00:53:11,350
One of the funny things about game development, especially AAA game development, is usually

991
00:53:11,710 --> 00:53:14,972
if you're working on something, it takes a few years to get out the door.

992
00:53:15,092 --> 00:53:18,573
I'm not going to be able to talk about any specifics right now in terms of anything you've

993
00:53:18,613 --> 00:53:19,013
seen that's...

994
00:53:19,373 --> 00:53:21,856
It's not showing up yet because we just put the lab out recently.

995
00:53:22,036 --> 00:53:23,017
What I will say is this.

996
00:53:23,357 --> 00:53:29,183
When we bring people into that lab and we start talking about inclusive design, what

997
00:53:29,243 --> 00:53:32,906
immediately comes up, almost always, is, oh, wow.

998
00:53:34,196 --> 00:53:35,736
You know, there's a tiny change here.

999
00:53:35,876 --> 00:53:38,077
There's a tweak here that we can make.

1000
00:53:38,117 --> 00:53:38,937
We already have this thing.

1001
00:53:38,957 --> 00:53:42,858
If we just tweak it one more degree, we can all of a sudden

1002
00:53:42,898 --> 00:53:43,978
have this accessible feature.

1003
00:53:44,238 --> 00:53:45,519
We see tons of that, right?

1004
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:49,860
So it's fantastic, because I'm seeing game devs who have

1005
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:52,940
already thought about features that can have some really

1006
00:53:53,020 --> 00:53:55,841
inclusive potential, some really accessible potential.

1007
00:53:56,361 --> 00:54:00,862
They just need one extra step, they come in, they make those connections, and we see them

1008
00:54:00,922 --> 00:54:02,462
starting to make those changes.

1009
00:54:02,782 --> 00:54:03,763
So it's great to help.

1010
00:54:04,443 --> 00:54:09,404
It's been really valuable in terms of helping people knock out some of those low-hanging

1011
00:54:09,724 --> 00:54:10,744
fruits of accessibility.

1012
00:54:10,764 --> 00:54:11,244
Go ahead.

1013
00:54:11,264 --> 00:54:11,704
One additional thing.

1014
00:54:11,724 --> 00:54:12,665
The lab is shared with our partner partners.

1015
00:54:12,685 --> 00:54:13,745
We bring our partners to the dorm all the time.

1016
00:54:13,765 --> 00:54:14,145
And recently we-

1017
00:54:14,165 --> 00:54:16,466
Evelyn, can I actually ask you, because they're recording us.

1018
00:54:16,486 --> 00:54:16,666
Yeah, sure.

1019
00:54:16,686 --> 00:54:17,406
I'm going to ask you a question.

1020
00:54:17,426 --> 00:54:18,686
I'm going to ask you a question.

1021
00:54:18,726 --> 00:54:19,646
I'm going to ask you a question.

1022
00:54:19,666 --> 00:54:20,346
I'm going to ask you a question.

1023
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:21,327
I'm going to ask you a question.

1024
00:54:21,347 --> 00:54:22,187
I'm going to ask you a question.

1025
00:54:22,207 --> 00:54:22,847
I'm going to ask you a question.

1026
00:54:22,867 --> 00:54:23,507
I'm going to ask you a question.

1027
00:54:24,341 --> 00:54:25,422
I'm going to go to the mic.

1028
00:54:25,462 --> 00:54:26,983
We're lapped.

1029
00:54:27,363 --> 00:54:29,285
I don't think you want to talk into Brandon's neck.

1030
00:54:31,506 --> 00:54:35,269
So one of the things that we had was a hardware partner that came into the lab,

1031
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:37,971
and they were pitching a particular accessory,

1032
00:54:38,452 --> 00:54:40,633
and once they walked them through the tour of the lab,

1033
00:54:41,054 --> 00:54:43,995
It fundamentally changed how they thought about their product,

1034
00:54:44,135 --> 00:54:45,816
and it changed the pitch for the product

1035
00:54:45,976 --> 00:54:48,317
to be inclusive forward.

1036
00:54:48,897 --> 00:54:51,379
And they went back to their developers

1037
00:54:51,659 --> 00:54:54,700
and started thinking more about how that really influences

1038
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:56,001
the products that they bring to market.

1039
00:54:57,101 --> 00:54:58,142
Thank you so much for your questions.

1040
00:54:58,242 --> 00:54:58,802
Appreciate it.

1041
00:55:00,123 --> 00:55:00,943
All right, who's next?

1042
00:55:03,792 --> 00:55:04,993
So I had my students bug me.

1043
00:55:05,253 --> 00:55:06,355
Oh yeah, no, hey, I hear you.

1044
00:55:06,675 --> 00:55:08,917
So I'm a teacher actually building a lab.

1045
00:55:09,238 --> 00:55:09,538
Oh wow.

1046
00:55:09,658 --> 00:55:13,262
And I was more interested in what sort of findings you've had for your

1047
00:55:13,282 --> 00:55:16,526
developers because I have a lot of students that have a lot of these same

1048
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:19,790
disabilities and I was wondering if you'd had any findings from your time

1049
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:22,793
bringing teams through for the developers at your studios.

1050
00:55:23,374 --> 00:55:23,714
So I think.

1051
00:55:24,531 --> 00:55:27,993
For us, we don't want to be like, hey, this is how you should develop your games.

1052
00:55:28,113 --> 00:55:33,017
It's presenting the challenges that the like.

1053
00:55:33,037 --> 00:55:36,619
So in your case, like showing people what the students are doing.

1054
00:55:36,699 --> 00:55:39,401
So when we were looking at what Special

1055
00:55:39,421 --> 00:55:43,544
Effect was doing with the crazy controllers, we like, OK, how do we make that easier?

1056
00:55:43,564 --> 00:55:44,565
I don't think I said it.

1057
00:55:44,845 --> 00:55:47,987
So from the other side, for your actual developers that are disabled.

1058
00:55:49,428 --> 00:55:49,869
Oh, OK.

1059
00:55:49,889 --> 00:55:50,289
Yeah.

1060
00:55:52,243 --> 00:55:56,105
I think one of the fascinating things about the game industry right now is that we're

1061
00:55:56,125 --> 00:55:59,767
thinking a lot now about accessibility in games, and that's fantastic.

1062
00:55:59,847 --> 00:56:00,747
I mean, I've seen more...

1063
00:56:01,628 --> 00:56:05,810
The momentum in the last two years outdoes anything I've seen in the previous 13 years

1064
00:56:05,850 --> 00:56:06,330
of my career.

1065
00:56:06,690 --> 00:56:08,511
But the fact of the matter is, is that...

1066
00:56:10,622 --> 00:56:16,547
middleware tools okay game development tools are lagging behind actually right

1067
00:56:16,747 --> 00:56:21,712
so even I've noticed yeah right so it's absolutely something we talk about when

1068
00:56:21,752 --> 00:56:26,116
we're talking about game development and it actually it's surprising how often it

1069
00:56:26,156 --> 00:56:27,096
comes up when people say

1070
00:56:27,537 --> 00:56:29,877
Oh, man, you know, I'm building in this engine.

1071
00:56:30,357 --> 00:56:32,778
And it's just really, really difficult to implement

1072
00:56:33,038 --> 00:56:34,638
that feature in this engine.

1073
00:56:35,118 --> 00:56:36,899
Those sorts of conversations are being had.

1074
00:56:37,359 --> 00:56:40,459
Internally, we also have a lot of our own internal development

1075
00:56:40,499 --> 00:56:41,240
tools that we use.

1076
00:56:41,900 --> 00:56:44,560
And as you're starting to go through and run these tools

1077
00:56:44,600 --> 00:56:46,841
through some of the simulations things we have,

1078
00:56:46,881 --> 00:56:48,121
and we're showing people how to build,

1079
00:56:48,381 --> 00:56:50,462
you start to find those problems really quick.

1080
00:56:50,562 --> 00:56:53,642
So yes, we try to not just talk about inclusive game

1081
00:56:53,682 --> 00:56:56,143
development in terms of the end product for the customer.

1082
00:56:56,563 --> 00:56:58,325
But the tools need to be accessible too.

1083
00:56:58,625 --> 00:57:00,568
The engines need to be accessible too.

1084
00:57:00,888 --> 00:57:04,993
Because we want a larger group of people who identify as disabled,

1085
00:57:05,033 --> 00:57:07,716
people with disabilities, in the industry making the games.

1086
00:57:07,736 --> 00:57:08,898
And the only way that's going to happen

1087
00:57:08,978 --> 00:57:11,481
is if we make sure those tools and those engines are accessible to them.

1088
00:57:11,721 --> 00:57:16,446
Yeah, and we also totally understand that, like, it is great that we are making tools

1089
00:57:16,486 --> 00:57:20,570
to make game development, or games themselves more accessible, and the stuff that we're

1090
00:57:20,590 --> 00:57:21,351
putting out on the Xbox.

1091
00:57:21,571 --> 00:57:23,093
But we also know we're the end of the line.

1092
00:57:23,393 --> 00:57:27,858
Like, by the time you've gotten to us, like, if you hit a problem with the engine, you're

1093
00:57:27,878 --> 00:57:29,480
not making it to us to begin with.

1094
00:57:30,381 --> 00:57:33,544
So we recognize that it's great we're doing all this stuff.

1095
00:57:33,844 --> 00:57:37,945
But we need to have conversations and partnerships with people who are before us and earlier

1096
00:57:37,965 --> 00:57:39,566
in the pipeline to solve those problems.

1097
00:57:39,626 --> 00:57:45,768
Because if you are having the problem trying to use a screen reader with Unity, well, you're

1098
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:46,668
not going to make a game.

1099
00:57:46,988 --> 00:57:50,409
So you're never going to use our text-to-speech API, because you literally didn't get to us.

1100
00:57:50,769 --> 00:57:50,949
Yeah.

1101
00:57:51,550 --> 00:57:51,690
Yeah.

1102
00:57:52,517 --> 00:57:56,519
A couple of things I'll mention about that is you specifically asked about developers.

1103
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,663
We have found that when we brought people that are within Microsoft and go through the

1104
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:04,524
lab, it does two things.

1105
00:58:04,784 --> 00:58:10,767
One, we have some existing game developers who have not self-identified as having a disability.

1106
00:58:11,247 --> 00:58:15,572
And they've been inspired by the space and gone back to their team and disclosed their

1107
00:58:15,592 --> 00:58:19,116
disability to the team, because not all disabilities are visible, obviously.

1108
00:58:19,636 --> 00:58:26,343
And that has further educated their teammates about why it's important to invest in the

1109
00:58:26,423 --> 00:58:30,888
tools that we use on a daily basis and the methodology that we apply to actually how

1110
00:58:30,928 --> 00:58:31,649
we do development.

1111
00:58:32,149 --> 00:58:36,213
The other aspect that Brandon and Tara did talk about was the recruiting aspect.

1112
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:39,655
We have found amazing success, unintentionally,

1113
00:58:39,996 --> 00:58:43,138
having young developers coming in from all over the world.

1114
00:58:43,158 --> 00:58:45,981
We've had student groups from all over the world come in, Beijing.

1115
00:58:46,761 --> 00:58:49,684
We had folks coming in from Norway and Sweden.

1116
00:58:50,164 --> 00:58:55,649
And young developers were inspired by that and went back to their educators and

1117
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:59,712
curriculum creators and recommended that they actually build some more.

1118
00:59:00,933 --> 00:59:03,654
information in their curriculum specific to accessibility.

1119
00:59:04,014 --> 00:59:04,514
Absolutely.

1120
00:59:05,034 --> 00:59:05,835
Thanks, Alan.

1121
00:59:06,095 --> 00:59:06,675
Next question.

1122
00:59:08,576 --> 00:59:10,716
Hi there, thanks so much for the session.

1123
00:59:10,736 --> 00:59:11,877
Oh, no, thanks for coming.

1124
00:59:12,237 --> 00:59:14,018
As a reminder, if you love this session,

1125
00:59:14,058 --> 00:59:16,199
please rate us five stars when you fill out your survey.

1126
00:59:17,179 --> 00:59:17,579
For sure.

1127
00:59:17,879 --> 00:59:18,980
This isn't her first rodeo.

1128
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:19,380
Sorry.

1129
00:59:20,020 --> 00:59:20,300
Go on.

1130
00:59:20,660 --> 00:59:20,921
Okay.

1131
00:59:21,001 --> 00:59:23,622
So basically I have access to some space in town.

1132
00:59:23,742 --> 00:59:25,382
So here, the small space.

1133
00:59:25,722 --> 00:59:29,264
So that means I fulfilled at least the first condition of running a lab.

1134
00:59:29,944 --> 00:59:35,270
But aside from that, it's hidden, it's not in SOMA, it's just like an average neighborhood.

1135
00:59:35,290 --> 00:59:40,455
So I'm really interested in knowing the sorts of any kind of study cases I could take upon

1136
00:59:40,715 --> 00:59:47,382
to know, could you run a lab in a non-HIP neighborhood, much smaller scale, those kind

1137
00:59:47,422 --> 00:59:47,702
of things.

1138
00:59:48,103 --> 00:59:51,727
Yeah, well you know, we run our lab in probably, you know, I...

1139
00:59:53,012 --> 00:59:55,313
I don't know if you consider Microsoft hip or not.

1140
00:59:55,333 --> 00:59:57,354
But we're in a studio, like in a small area,

1141
00:59:57,374 --> 01:00:00,075
and one off in Studio B.

1142
01:00:00,195 --> 01:00:07,278
But in terms of spaces that are outside of a specific studio,

1143
01:00:07,338 --> 01:00:08,818
like in neighbors and whatnot, we actually

1144
01:00:08,858 --> 01:00:09,859
don't have any studies on that.

1145
01:00:09,879 --> 01:00:11,539
That would be a fantastic thing to look into.

1146
01:00:11,879 --> 01:00:13,620
So after this talk, why don't we sync up?

1147
01:00:13,680 --> 01:00:15,161
I'd love to chat with you more about what

1148
01:00:15,181 --> 01:00:15,901
you're thinking about.

1149
01:00:16,101 --> 01:00:17,222
And there might be some opportunities.

1150
01:00:17,282 --> 01:00:18,882
And we can certainly try to track down some more

1151
01:00:18,902 --> 01:00:20,223
information, but today.

1152
01:00:20,563 --> 01:00:22,824
This is still a pretty new concept from what we've seen,

1153
01:00:23,024 --> 01:00:26,165
and I personally am not aware of anything that's been done

1154
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,825
outside of a studio or anything like that.

1155
01:00:27,885 --> 01:00:28,466
Oh, that'd be great.

1156
01:00:28,626 --> 01:00:31,687
Yeah, and it goes for the same for any of the audience here.

1157
01:00:31,707 --> 01:00:34,928
And if you guys want to, any persons here want to collaborate,

1158
01:00:35,108 --> 01:00:36,369
I will be happy to talk.

1159
01:00:36,469 --> 01:00:37,009
Fantastic.

1160
01:00:37,049 --> 01:00:37,989
All right, stick around then.

1161
01:00:38,309 --> 01:00:39,550
All right, hey, thank you guys so much.

1162
01:00:39,590 --> 01:00:40,410
We appreciate it.

1163
01:00:40,630 --> 01:00:41,991
And have a good rest of your conference.

1164
01:00:42,471 --> 01:00:42,911
Thanks, guys.
