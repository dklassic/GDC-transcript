1
00:00:05,603 --> 00:00:08,464
So my name is Teresa Derringer, and I'm

2
00:00:08,484 --> 00:00:09,905
going to be talking to you guys today

3
00:00:09,925 --> 00:00:13,806
about indie development and the economy of favors,

4
00:00:14,506 --> 00:00:16,886
and some of the risks, challenges, and rewards

5
00:00:16,906 --> 00:00:18,607
of participating in this economy.

6
00:00:19,587 --> 00:00:22,408
So I've got my contact details up here.

7
00:00:22,688 --> 00:00:25,229
Feel free to take a note if you want

8
00:00:25,249 --> 00:00:27,009
to get in touch with me after the presentation.

9
00:00:27,369 --> 00:00:28,790
They're also going to be on the last slide.

10
00:00:32,486 --> 00:00:33,706
So I am an indie developer.

11
00:00:34,307 --> 00:00:38,929
I've been doing this for about three years, and I've most recently made a game called

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:39,670
Cannon Brawl.

13
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:44,693
And this is something that I've just shipped on Linux, PC, and Mac on Steam.

14
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:49,736
It's something that I worked on with one other person, Pete Angstadt, who's right there.

15
00:00:51,757 --> 00:00:54,859
And together the two of us formed a tiny indie team called Turtle Sandbox.

16
00:00:57,089 --> 00:00:58,730
So this is a 2D artillery game.

17
00:00:59,431 --> 00:01:02,293
It's an RTS, kind of worms meet StarCraft.

18
00:01:03,334 --> 00:01:04,415
It's a lot of fun, you should play it.

19
00:01:05,656 --> 00:01:07,357
And during development of this game,

20
00:01:07,737 --> 00:01:09,479
my picture of what indie development is

21
00:01:09,559 --> 00:01:10,840
has fundamentally shifted.

22
00:01:12,461 --> 00:01:14,362
So my background is in AAA.

23
00:01:14,863 --> 00:01:15,903
I've worked on a lot of games

24
00:01:16,004 --> 00:01:18,125
at a couple different companies, mostly AMAXIS.

25
00:01:19,768 --> 00:01:22,269
And some of these games include Zumbinis, which was not at Maxis,

26
00:01:22,949 --> 00:01:27,191
The Godfather, The Sims, Spore, some expansions for Spore,

27
00:01:27,871 --> 00:01:30,032
Dark Spore, and most recently SimCity.

28
00:01:30,052 --> 00:01:35,094
I'll actually talk about one more thing there.

29
00:01:35,374 --> 00:01:38,215
So when I was at Maxis, I was sort of a juggler of all trades.

30
00:01:38,755 --> 00:01:40,916
I had a lot of roles. I started as a tester,

31
00:01:40,936 --> 00:01:44,157
I became a community manager, I was a producer,

32
00:01:44,337 --> 00:01:47,638
and by the time I left, I was doing programming and graphic design on the online team.

33
00:01:49,138 --> 00:01:51,119
So it really was a natural fit for me to go indie.

34
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:56,803
And while I was making all these big games at these companies,

35
00:01:58,484 --> 00:02:00,285
I actually got a chance to make something really small

36
00:02:00,305 --> 00:02:00,745
by myself.

37
00:02:01,626 --> 00:02:04,267
So on Spore, we released the Spore API

38
00:02:04,707 --> 00:02:07,309
so that players could make their own games using

39
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,492
any subset of the over 200 million creations that

40
00:02:11,512 --> 00:02:14,133
were uploaded by players into the Sporepedia.

41
00:02:15,386 --> 00:02:17,269
And when we released this API, I wanted

42
00:02:17,309 --> 00:02:19,892
to create an example application to just show,

43
00:02:19,912 --> 00:02:22,035
here's something that you can do with these creations.

44
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:23,497
So this is Psych Explore.

45
00:02:23,998 --> 00:02:25,720
And what it would do is show a bunch

46
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,102
of creations on the screen.

47
00:02:27,202 --> 00:02:28,604
They all have a common tag word.

48
00:02:29,205 --> 00:02:31,107
And the player just has to guess what that tag word is.

49
00:02:32,051 --> 00:02:36,535
And while the style of this game is grounded in the visual language

50
00:02:36,575 --> 00:02:38,457
that was established by the UI team on Spore,

51
00:02:39,118 --> 00:02:40,779
and the creations came from the community,

52
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:43,502
it was the first game I felt like I had a lot of ownership over,

53
00:02:43,702 --> 00:02:45,283
and I just made the whole thing by myself.

54
00:02:45,904 --> 00:02:47,045
It gave me a lot of creative freedom.

55
00:02:47,646 --> 00:02:49,748
It was the impetus for me to break out and go indie.

56
00:02:51,489 --> 00:02:53,411
So when I embarked on this indie adventure,

57
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:55,513
I thought it was going to be like this.

58
00:02:55,753 --> 00:02:57,515
I thought I would be a Lone Ranger.

59
00:02:58,511 --> 00:03:01,893
And when you think of the word Indie, some phrases are evoked, like

60
00:03:02,994 --> 00:03:07,938
self-made, self-reliant, and pulling yourself up by your bootstraps.

61
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:16,904
But as I've been an Indie developer, I think that this common model of Indie development as a solo venture has become less and less valid.

62
00:03:18,305 --> 00:03:21,787
The word Indie is short for independent, but I think that's a misnomer,

63
00:03:22,248 --> 00:03:25,150
because right now Indie development is actually more interdependent.

64
00:03:27,158 --> 00:03:28,599
So I thought this is what was going to happen.

65
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,961
I thought I was going to be going into my home office

66
00:03:31,021 --> 00:03:34,763
or my bedroom with my pajamas and emerging a year later

67
00:03:34,903 --> 00:03:37,465
with this beautiful opus of personal magnitude.

68
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:39,926
And I think I thought that

69
00:03:40,026 --> 00:03:42,448
because there's this pervasive hero narrative out there

70
00:03:43,608 --> 00:03:45,429
about the lone dev against the world

71
00:03:45,770 --> 00:03:48,431
who is single-handedly crafting a beautiful masterpiece

72
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:50,833
and they were never relying on any connections.

73
00:03:51,914 --> 00:03:54,095
This idea has been romanticized by the press.

74
00:03:55,195 --> 00:03:57,556
If you hear a story about this, you'll probably hear

75
00:03:57,596 --> 00:03:59,757
about a garage involved somewhere in the anecdote.

76
00:04:00,678 --> 00:04:03,039
And it's very easy to digest, it's popular,

77
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:05,660
but it's not representative of what indie development is.

78
00:04:07,841 --> 00:04:10,142
So why is indie development interdependent right now?

79
00:04:11,262 --> 00:04:13,203
I would argue it's because the bar has been raised.

80
00:04:14,303 --> 00:04:16,704
And the bar has been raised because indie game consumption

81
00:04:16,744 --> 00:04:17,545
has gone mainstream.

82
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:21,081
So, you guys might have heard a game called Minecraft.

83
00:04:21,681 --> 00:04:23,582
Pretty much everyone I know who has kids,

84
00:04:24,242 --> 00:04:25,742
those kids are playing Minecraft right now.

85
00:04:26,663 --> 00:04:27,663
And they're games like Braid,

86
00:04:27,983 --> 00:04:30,184
that really sort of broke out indie games

87
00:04:30,584 --> 00:04:34,065
from being these sort of niche consumer gems

88
00:04:34,245 --> 00:04:35,226
into the mainstream.

89
00:04:36,586 --> 00:04:38,767
Because they're mainstream, the demand is higher than ever.

90
00:04:39,775 --> 00:04:41,575
And so that means that the developer community

91
00:04:41,615 --> 00:04:43,375
has risen to meet that demand.

92
00:04:43,635 --> 00:04:45,156
And more and more games have been churned out,

93
00:04:45,756 --> 00:04:47,456
which actually just makes it harder and harder

94
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,636
to stand out from the crowd.

95
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,157
So here's an example from IGN.

96
00:04:52,197 --> 00:04:53,137
This is their website.

97
00:04:53,897 --> 00:04:56,098
And they show the top games of 2014.

98
00:04:57,298 --> 00:04:59,078
And amongst the AAA games that are shown here,

99
00:04:59,439 --> 00:05:01,959
you'll see indie games like Shovel Knight and Transistor.

100
00:05:03,139 --> 00:05:05,180
These games have massively different budgets.

101
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:09,439
But that's not immediately obvious to the consumer.

102
00:05:10,259 --> 00:05:13,940
This really blurs the line between what is seen as an indie game and what is seen as

103
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,141
AAA, and it drives the pressure to deliver up higher than ever.

104
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:24,883
As indie developers, we're competing with AAA companies who have teams of people at

105
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:26,363
their disposal to get things done.

106
00:05:27,364 --> 00:05:30,785
And if indie developers try to do all of these things themselves, they'll flail.

107
00:05:32,087 --> 00:05:34,768
What's happening, in my opinion, is that tribes are forming

108
00:05:35,649 --> 00:05:37,970
to create layers of support, which

109
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:41,271
help them to accomplish the same tasks that AAA teams are

110
00:05:41,291 --> 00:05:43,913
doing with massive internal organizations.

111
00:05:45,833 --> 00:05:47,454
Some of the tribes here in California

112
00:05:47,654 --> 00:05:50,896
include places like West Indies in the Bay Area.

113
00:05:50,976 --> 00:05:52,537
There's Glitch City down in LA.

114
00:05:53,717 --> 00:05:56,578
There's Game Nest, which just popped up in San Francisco.

115
00:05:57,159 --> 00:05:59,560
There's also Hacker Dojo, which is not necessarily

116
00:05:59,620 --> 00:06:00,520
gaming-specific.

117
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:00,820
But.

118
00:06:01,665 --> 00:06:03,366
does support Indies in the tech space.

119
00:06:05,487 --> 00:06:06,788
So this is what I'm talking about

120
00:06:06,828 --> 00:06:08,328
when I say the economy of favors.

121
00:06:08,788 --> 00:06:11,550
It's a quid pro quo exchange of services

122
00:06:11,630 --> 00:06:13,911
to help Indies be competitive against AAAs.

123
00:06:15,791 --> 00:06:17,012
So if you're an Indie developer,

124
00:06:17,652 --> 00:06:19,673
you probably went Indie because you're good

125
00:06:19,713 --> 00:06:21,374
at one of these four core disciplines,

126
00:06:21,834 --> 00:06:26,576
programming, art, audio, maybe, or design, definitely.

127
00:06:28,864 --> 00:06:33,668
But there are a lot of other disciplines that you have to tackle in order to bring a game successfully to market.

128
00:06:34,208 --> 00:06:38,932
These things are like legal, financing, marketing, events, there's a zillion.

129
00:06:40,713 --> 00:06:45,657
And actually a lot of indie developers have gone indie to avoid some of these peripheral disciplines.

130
00:06:46,038 --> 00:06:50,962
The irony is that they become personally saddled with them, even though they may not be very good at them.

131
00:06:51,742 --> 00:06:56,506
So these tribes are forming to establish pools of shared resources.

132
00:06:57,559 --> 00:07:00,121
that can help indie developers tackle some of these peripherals.

133
00:07:01,423 --> 00:07:06,707
So one example that I've seen where this is happening is I go to this group called West

134
00:07:06,747 --> 00:07:09,830
Indies and there's a guy Tim Conkling from Antihero.

135
00:07:10,711 --> 00:07:15,515
And he said that what he does with his tribe, he didn't use that word, is that they do a

136
00:07:15,555 --> 00:07:16,216
weekly standup.

137
00:07:16,957 --> 00:07:22,301
And that's not just with indie developers that are on his team or working on his game.

138
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,223
That's people who are working on other games.

139
00:07:25,217 --> 00:07:26,838
but it fosters an accountability

140
00:07:27,298 --> 00:07:28,738
and it fosters a productiveness

141
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:32,660
that can be really helpful to them, keeps them motivated.

142
00:07:33,380 --> 00:07:35,781
So he's really stepping into this production manager role,

143
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,702
which is not something that indies usually have the luxury

144
00:07:39,222 --> 00:07:41,043
of hiring a production manager

145
00:07:41,403 --> 00:07:44,124
because you just don't necessarily have the budget.

146
00:07:45,964 --> 00:07:49,666
And in that way, he's kind of helping share resources

147
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:50,986
and establishing this tribe.

148
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:53,807
So at a high level,

149
00:07:54,819 --> 00:07:58,981
I would say that the benefits of these tribes is that they carry each other to the top.

150
00:07:59,641 --> 00:08:04,364
You want your fellow tribe members to succeed because success begets success.

151
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:09,106
If you have a fellow tribe member who has a really successful game, you may have access

152
00:08:09,126 --> 00:08:11,727
to better workspaces yourself just by your connections with them.

153
00:08:12,648 --> 00:08:14,589
You may have more legitimacy with the press, etc.

154
00:08:19,974 --> 00:08:21,455
So how do you find out about these tribes?

155
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,859
It's true that some of them are secretive and very exclusive,

156
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,083
but there's some points of entry that I can suggest.

157
00:08:30,025 --> 00:08:31,306
So show your game at conventions.

158
00:08:31,486 --> 00:08:32,327
We're at GDC.

159
00:08:33,208 --> 00:08:33,869
There's PAX.

160
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:34,730
There's Indicade.

161
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:35,531
There's GamerX.

162
00:08:35,891 --> 00:08:36,532
There's a lot more.

163
00:08:38,722 --> 00:08:42,848
This is going to be one of the highest concentrations of talented developers that you're going to have access to.

164
00:08:44,390 --> 00:08:47,094
There are limited slots to show your game at these conventions,

165
00:08:47,574 --> 00:08:52,541
but I think you can sort of leverage the economy of favors to have a little bit more success.

166
00:08:52,701 --> 00:08:54,324
So one thing I've done is I've sort of...

167
00:08:55,684 --> 00:08:58,025
Sometimes if I don't get my game shown at a convention,

168
00:08:58,205 --> 00:09:02,106
I'll email the organizers and ask if I can fill in

169
00:09:02,486 --> 00:09:05,547
for someone who is a no-show or a cancellation.

170
00:09:05,907 --> 00:09:08,468
And it sort of switches from I'm asking them for something

171
00:09:08,548 --> 00:09:09,708
to I'm offering them something.

172
00:09:10,068 --> 00:09:11,789
And I've never actually had that not work out.

173
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:14,050
When you're at these conventions,

174
00:09:14,250 --> 00:09:16,690
I think one other thing that's kind of counterintuitive

175
00:09:17,331 --> 00:09:19,951
is that you funnel traffic from people

176
00:09:20,011 --> 00:09:21,252
who are done playing your game

177
00:09:21,712 --> 00:09:23,312
to another game that's similar to yours.

178
00:09:23,412 --> 00:09:24,773
They might seem like your competitor.

179
00:09:26,205 --> 00:09:28,045
And the reason I think that's a good idea is that,

180
00:09:28,386 --> 00:09:30,326
in general, it builds excitement for your genre.

181
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,748
But also, it extends to goodwill to a developer

182
00:09:33,808 --> 00:09:34,868
who's probably tackling,

183
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:36,609
they're probably the one person in the world

184
00:09:36,829 --> 00:09:38,910
who's tackling the same problems that you're tackling.

185
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,391
And so if you can build a relationship with them,

186
00:09:41,771 --> 00:09:44,012
you can be helping each other in the future.

187
00:09:45,713 --> 00:09:48,574
So one example of how to be a little bit scrappy

188
00:09:49,154 --> 00:09:50,655
at a convention that I've done is,

189
00:09:51,475 --> 00:09:54,996
I went to Indie Press Day at GDC a few years ago.

190
00:09:56,046 --> 00:09:59,307
And I went early, and I stayed late, and I cleaned up.

191
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:00,907
And they didn't ask me to do that.

192
00:10:01,407 --> 00:10:03,987
But because I did that, I was able to establish a rapport

193
00:10:04,007 --> 00:10:05,308
with the organizer of this event,

194
00:10:06,188 --> 00:10:07,828
who then invited me to show in the future,

195
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,169
who then invited me to host the Twitch stream

196
00:10:10,409 --> 00:10:13,749
that was on the front page of Twitch on Monday at IGN.

197
00:10:13,809 --> 00:10:15,890
So it was a great opportunity for me to plug my game.

198
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:19,510
So that's sort of that favors paying off.

199
00:10:21,871 --> 00:10:23,891
Another place that you can find out about these tribes

200
00:10:24,031 --> 00:10:25,072
are at shared workspaces.

201
00:10:26,303 --> 00:10:29,324
So, these can be tribes in and of themselves.

202
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:32,105
At these shared workspaces, you can exchange feedback,

203
00:10:32,906 --> 00:10:34,706
and really importantly, you can sort of

204
00:10:35,047 --> 00:10:36,427
fill the role of QA testers,

205
00:10:36,507 --> 00:10:39,348
because indie developers don't have QA teams.

206
00:10:40,729 --> 00:10:42,190
But it's something you can do for each other,

207
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:43,830
as QA each other's games.

208
00:10:44,916 --> 00:10:47,098
These shared workspaces act as watering holes

209
00:10:47,298 --> 00:10:49,340
where people can exchange information

210
00:10:49,881 --> 00:10:52,563
about things like contests, conventions, press events,

211
00:10:53,083 --> 00:10:54,805
because Indie development really relies

212
00:10:54,905 --> 00:10:58,328
on this word of mouth underground to get things going.

213
00:10:58,749 --> 00:11:00,190
So it's really important to plug into that.

214
00:11:00,570 --> 00:11:03,033
So some of the shared spaces I know about in San Francisco

215
00:11:03,053 --> 00:11:06,416
are at Double Fine, there's Hacker Dojo,

216
00:11:06,456 --> 00:11:08,498
there's Indie Open House at IGN,

217
00:11:08,598 --> 00:11:10,099
and Game Nest recently opened in the city.

218
00:11:11,997 --> 00:11:14,678
So if you find these tribes, how do you get your foot in the door?

219
00:11:14,698 --> 00:11:18,560
I think the best thing you can do is establish yourself as a fixture.

220
00:11:19,321 --> 00:11:20,641
So participate in game jams.

221
00:11:21,262 --> 00:11:23,563
So there's a global game jam that just happened.

222
00:11:23,603 --> 00:11:26,244
Ludum Dare is a quarterly game jam.

223
00:11:26,844 --> 00:11:29,085
Some of these game jams are at physical spaces.

224
00:11:29,185 --> 00:11:30,646
So this is a game that I made.

225
00:11:30,666 --> 00:11:33,767
It's called Mathgrams for the SIFTIO, and this was here in San Francisco.

226
00:11:34,768 --> 00:11:35,888
I also do Ludum Dare.

227
00:11:36,189 --> 00:11:37,649
This is Beneath the Surface 29,

228
00:11:38,350 --> 00:11:40,891
and I made this game called Platform Hero.

229
00:11:42,355 --> 00:11:43,816
And this is an app I made for the Pebble.

230
00:11:44,356 --> 00:11:44,916
It's yoga.

231
00:11:45,336 --> 00:11:47,037
It was part of the Facebook Wearables Hackathon.

232
00:11:47,617 --> 00:11:49,018
The important thing is just to show up

233
00:11:49,498 --> 00:11:51,018
and show what you're excited about working on

234
00:11:51,338 --> 00:11:52,959
because you'll meet people who are gonna be excited

235
00:11:52,979 --> 00:11:54,719
about those same things and you'll be able to connect.

236
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,501
Something a little bit more grassroots that I've done

237
00:11:58,521 --> 00:12:00,001
is establish a game night.

238
00:12:00,361 --> 00:12:01,802
I do this at my house once a month.

239
00:12:02,182 --> 00:12:03,062
These are Jell-O shots.

240
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:04,963
They're D20s that I made for game night.

241
00:12:07,202 --> 00:12:10,385
And I wasn't really expecting this to pay off in my life the way it has,

242
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:14,829
but I basically collect interdisciplinary people from across the industry.

243
00:12:15,149 --> 00:12:19,113
So some of the people who come to this include lawyers, press people,

244
00:12:19,573 --> 00:12:21,535
some of them are other game developers.

245
00:12:21,996 --> 00:12:25,439
And it's a great way to mix people who might not necessarily mix on their own,

246
00:12:25,559 --> 00:12:27,941
especially as an indie, where you're not meeting these people

247
00:12:27,981 --> 00:12:30,824
from all across disciplines on a regular basis.

248
00:12:31,782 --> 00:12:34,924
It also gives me something a little bit more personal to connect with people

249
00:12:35,525 --> 00:12:36,745
after meeting them at a convention.

250
00:12:37,086 --> 00:12:38,126
So I don't just have to say,

251
00:12:38,386 --> 00:12:40,068
hey, let's connect on LinkedIn.

252
00:12:40,088 --> 00:12:44,530
I think that this establishes a little bit more meaningful relationship.

253
00:12:45,931 --> 00:12:46,972
If you're not into board games,

254
00:12:47,492 --> 00:12:50,895
some other things you can do are host a Kleenex test

255
00:12:51,315 --> 00:12:55,758
to exchange sort of fresh eyes, perspectives on your games.

256
00:12:56,811 --> 00:12:59,332
my buddy Justin put together a press event.

257
00:12:59,512 --> 00:13:02,813
And so he got a lot of the different indie developers

258
00:13:02,853 --> 00:13:04,293
in his area into one space.

259
00:13:04,633 --> 00:13:05,913
And when you have that big momentum,

260
00:13:05,973 --> 00:13:07,214
you can start attracting press.

261
00:13:08,674 --> 00:13:11,655
But you can do things just as informal as Ultimate Frisbee.

262
00:13:11,715 --> 00:13:13,295
I play Ultimate Frisbee with some of my other

263
00:13:13,355 --> 00:13:15,396
indie developer friends, and I have a cooking club.

264
00:13:18,257 --> 00:13:20,657
So there are more and more people

265
00:13:20,917 --> 00:13:22,398
in indie development than ever before.

266
00:13:22,818 --> 00:13:24,758
And so these tribes are popping up more and more.

267
00:13:25,583 --> 00:13:28,245
And part of that is because there has been an exodus from AAA.

268
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:34,351
The reason I think that is, is because AAA games have exploded budgets.

269
00:13:34,771 --> 00:13:37,874
They're so huge, they cannot afford to take the same risks,

270
00:13:39,375 --> 00:13:41,377
because they just have to make a game that they know is going to sell.

271
00:13:42,218 --> 00:13:45,781
And this has created a space for indies to occupy on the creative fringes.

272
00:13:46,362 --> 00:13:52,307
This has been really attractive to a lot of people who have become disillusioned with AAA development.

273
00:13:53,660 --> 00:13:57,742
And so there's been this injection of people with a lot of expertise coming from AAA,

274
00:13:58,183 --> 00:14:01,765
which is driving up the talent in the indie game space.

275
00:14:02,445 --> 00:14:05,387
This is something you can take advantage of by participating in these tribes,

276
00:14:06,047 --> 00:14:07,708
but it's something you'll have to fight against if you don't.

277
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:12,952
In the last 10 years, there's been an explosion in digital distribution

278
00:14:13,232 --> 00:14:16,454
with things like Steam, the PlayStation Store, Xbox Marketplace.

279
00:14:18,479 --> 00:14:22,701
Local tribes of Indies are actually competing for a global market which is not saturated.

280
00:14:23,201 --> 00:14:28,584
So never before have two kids from San Francisco been able to bring a game to market in Russia,

281
00:14:29,205 --> 00:14:32,347
and I say that because for some reason we always have dedicated communities in Russia.

282
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:38,430
And the games that we're making are creative products. They're generative.

283
00:14:39,151 --> 00:14:42,613
Games are not a finite resource. So it's not like we're oil miners,

284
00:14:42,973 --> 00:14:45,594
and if someone else takes more of the oil, there's less for me.

285
00:14:46,808 --> 00:14:49,789
In many industries, when you aid a rival, you make them stronger.

286
00:14:49,809 --> 00:14:52,530
And they can take more of the pie.

287
00:14:53,510 --> 00:14:56,451
But in our case, our product is not a finite resource.

288
00:14:56,851 --> 00:14:57,711
And the pie is huge.

289
00:14:58,271 --> 00:15:00,812
So while AAA companies need to sell millions of copies

290
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:02,433
to support their development studios,

291
00:15:02,833 --> 00:15:04,893
indies only need to sell a fraction of a fraction

292
00:15:04,913 --> 00:15:05,913
of that amount to be viable.

293
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:13,494
And I would say that this lack of competition between local indies relative to the global markets

294
00:15:13,894 --> 00:15:16,975
disrupts typical models of scarcity and supply and demand,

295
00:15:17,576 --> 00:15:19,916
and actually pushes us towards collaboration,

296
00:15:20,456 --> 00:15:23,337
because the benefits of collaboration outweigh the costs and competition.

297
00:15:25,818 --> 00:15:30,239
A kind of tribal economics takes over, and I think of this metaphor as a barn raising.

298
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:34,761
So, you can raise your own barn yourself, but it's probably inefficient.

299
00:15:35,201 --> 00:15:36,841
It would be better if other people help you out.

300
00:15:37,765 --> 00:15:39,586
And the incentive for those other people to help you

301
00:15:39,906 --> 00:15:41,226
is that when they need to raise their barn,

302
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:43,247
you'll probably be willing to pitch in.

303
00:15:44,308 --> 00:15:46,649
So for indies, our biggest risk is discoverability.

304
00:15:47,189 --> 00:15:49,050
But there's so many games that are coming out,

305
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:50,371
it's really hard to get noticed.

306
00:15:50,771 --> 00:15:54,473
And I've noticed that in the tribes I participate in,

307
00:15:54,813 --> 00:15:57,555
people will rally around one person's launch

308
00:15:58,015 --> 00:16:00,236
and just get on social media and get out there

309
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:01,097
and hype that game.

310
00:16:01,637 --> 00:16:03,017
And the reason that people are doing that

311
00:16:03,078 --> 00:16:05,219
is they know that when they're gonna launch their own game,

312
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:05,959
they'll have that.

313
00:16:06,879 --> 00:16:08,281
word of mouth that they can rely on.

314
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:12,706
So asking for help can feel really bad.

315
00:16:12,726 --> 00:16:14,028
It can feel like a burden.

316
00:16:14,568 --> 00:16:16,371
People don't go indie because they want help

317
00:16:16,391 --> 00:16:16,971
from other people.

318
00:16:17,972 --> 00:16:20,075
I've become convinced it's always good to ask for help

319
00:16:20,876 --> 00:16:22,618
because it lets people know what you're excited

320
00:16:22,658 --> 00:16:25,942
about working on and it opens the dialogue for exchange.

321
00:16:27,988 --> 00:16:32,209
So one little random example where asking for help paid off big time for me

322
00:16:32,749 --> 00:16:35,710
was I was at this event in San Francisco called the Showdown at the Foundry.

323
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:38,831
It's a place you can have a beer, play some eSports, play some board games.

324
00:16:40,631 --> 00:16:42,972
I missed my last train and I asked one of the organizers

325
00:16:43,352 --> 00:16:46,012
if he would be willing to give me a ride, which he did because he's a nice guy.

326
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:49,873
On the ride, I was able to talk about my game, Cannon Brawl,

327
00:16:50,573 --> 00:16:53,054
and develop a little bit of a rapport with him.

328
00:16:54,057 --> 00:16:56,477
which led him to inviting me to show my game in the future.

329
00:16:57,017 --> 00:16:59,698
And that wasn't just cool because I got to participate in his event

330
00:17:00,018 --> 00:17:03,319
and have my game on a big screen and get to talk to a lot of players

331
00:17:03,479 --> 00:17:05,020
and sell a lot of copies of my game.

332
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:09,861
It was also cool because they do events like the Extra Life Kickoff,

333
00:17:10,161 --> 00:17:11,622
where I got to participate in charity

334
00:17:12,022 --> 00:17:14,303
that also helped me get to the front page of Twitch again

335
00:17:14,683 --> 00:17:17,824
and get some really popular and talented streamers who are on...

336
00:17:19,024 --> 00:17:22,745
Twitch and YouTube, including LolReneNe, GassyMexican, and Iamspoon,

337
00:17:23,326 --> 00:17:27,167
to bring their talent and entertainment value to talking about my game.

338
00:17:29,588 --> 00:17:34,370
But favors don't have to be freebies, they don't have to be like really random events like that.

339
00:17:35,226 --> 00:17:40,690
You can also do things like revenue share with people to avoid having to raise advanced capital based on trust.

340
00:17:41,271 --> 00:17:46,575
For example, at my shared office, there's this guy, he's pretty great, his name is Todd.

341
00:17:47,196 --> 00:17:53,461
And when I needed to bring CannonBrawl to more platforms, because I had a relationship with Todd from that shared workspace,

342
00:17:54,341 --> 00:17:58,445
he was willing to port to Linux and Mac, and it was great, I didn't have to raise advanced capital.

343
00:18:00,639 --> 00:18:02,021
When you're exchanging these favors,

344
00:18:02,362 --> 00:18:03,925
oftentimes it's not a zero-sum game.

345
00:18:04,586 --> 00:18:05,688
They're mutual benefits.

346
00:18:06,108 --> 00:18:08,512
So for example, if you're approaching a press person

347
00:18:08,933 --> 00:18:10,556
to try and get some coverage for your game,

348
00:18:10,876 --> 00:18:12,339
you're offering them content to write about.

349
00:18:13,463 --> 00:18:15,404
And more importantly, if you're approaching someone

350
00:18:15,664 --> 00:18:18,805
who's maybe a Let's Play host or a Twitch streamer,

351
00:18:19,526 --> 00:18:20,826
you're giving them an opportunity

352
00:18:20,886 --> 00:18:22,307
to springboard off of your success.

353
00:18:22,447 --> 00:18:24,328
So there are people like Northern Lion,

354
00:18:24,388 --> 00:18:27,930
who does Let's Plays, and he found Binding of Isaac.

355
00:18:28,350 --> 00:18:31,391
And that game really catapulted him into the limelight.

356
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:34,473
Now he makes his living off of his streams.

357
00:18:37,074 --> 00:18:39,435
So one example of a mutually beneficial exchange,

358
00:18:39,975 --> 00:18:40,996
another kind of random one.

359
00:18:41,922 --> 00:18:43,242
I go to a lot of board game conventions,

360
00:18:43,262 --> 00:18:44,223
because I really like board games,

361
00:18:44,363 --> 00:18:45,763
in case you guys haven't noticed.

362
00:18:46,263 --> 00:18:48,144
So I went to this game convention called Kublai Khan,

363
00:18:48,785 --> 00:18:50,885
and I met a lot of people there who were super duper nice.

364
00:18:51,506 --> 00:18:52,946
But they were complaining about their hotel,

365
00:18:53,086 --> 00:18:54,527
so I offered next time if they wanted

366
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:55,948
to couch surf at my place, they could.

367
00:18:56,628 --> 00:18:58,469
One person who took me up on the offer

368
00:18:58,549 --> 00:18:59,449
happened to be a lawyer,

369
00:19:00,109 --> 00:19:02,590
and so when it was time for me to trademark my game,

370
00:19:02,610 --> 00:19:04,591
I tapped him and asked him if he would help me

371
00:19:04,671 --> 00:19:06,792
with legal stuff, and I could avoid paying

372
00:19:06,832 --> 00:19:08,493
some really expensive lawyer fees.

373
00:19:08,973 --> 00:19:10,334
And he did, it was great, I got my trademark.

374
00:19:11,214 --> 00:19:15,615
And also in the future, I've had a lot of people approach me about how I did legal work for Cannonbrawl,

375
00:19:15,935 --> 00:19:18,755
and I make sure to reference that person who was super nice to me.

376
00:19:22,876 --> 00:19:27,177
So I think a few things are happening when there's a transaction of favors.

377
00:19:28,257 --> 00:19:31,178
First of all, the task gets done, and that's the most important thing.

378
00:19:31,698 --> 00:19:35,758
But second of all, the passion for your project spreads as people take ownership over its success.

379
00:19:36,478 --> 00:19:39,699
And thirdly, it makes people happy to help, which just fosters relationships.

380
00:19:41,001 --> 00:19:42,802
It's also important to ask for favors

381
00:19:43,463 --> 00:19:45,024
in places you might not necessarily think.

382
00:19:45,484 --> 00:19:47,165
I think a lot of people think of their community

383
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:49,707
as something they have a responsibility to foster,

384
00:19:49,987 --> 00:19:52,289
but they don't necessarily tap it for talent.

385
00:19:54,010 --> 00:19:55,351
But one thing that I did with Cannonball,

386
00:19:55,451 --> 00:20:00,554
as it's a super intense RTS that's very reliant

387
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:06,478
on the balance, is we have some of our top players

388
00:20:06,738 --> 00:20:08,640
like Chess Kitten come on Skypes with us.

389
00:20:09,618 --> 00:20:12,338
And they break down the things that they think we need to fix.

390
00:20:12,659 --> 00:20:14,059
And they have a level of expertise

391
00:20:14,099 --> 00:20:16,159
that we can't have access to on the development side,

392
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:17,320
coming from the players.

393
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:23,161
You can also get players to post about content ideas.

394
00:20:23,241 --> 00:20:24,741
Like, we have a thread where people

395
00:20:24,781 --> 00:20:26,402
post about the buildings that they want to see.

396
00:20:27,782 --> 00:20:29,122
And these are things that we've built in the game.

397
00:20:29,523 --> 00:20:31,163
And they've been some of our most popular buildings,

398
00:20:31,603 --> 00:20:33,443
because the buildings are kind of the units in our game.

399
00:20:34,610 --> 00:20:36,911
So there are a couple of unintuitive characteristics

400
00:20:36,971 --> 00:20:38,993
of the ebb and flow of the economy of favors

401
00:20:39,033 --> 00:20:39,673
that I've noticed.

402
00:20:39,993 --> 00:20:41,694
First of all, the asynchronicity.

403
00:20:41,714 --> 00:20:43,416
It's not turn-based.

404
00:20:43,496 --> 00:20:44,696
It's not like I'm gonna help you

405
00:20:44,797 --> 00:20:46,638
and then you're gonna help me and back and forth forever.

406
00:20:47,338 --> 00:20:50,580
So new indies are absorbing favors at a higher rate

407
00:20:51,321 --> 00:20:53,682
and their capacity to give back might be limited

408
00:20:53,762 --> 00:20:55,684
by their time, reach, and their experience.

409
00:20:55,704 --> 00:20:57,545
There's also an asymmetry.

410
00:20:58,045 --> 00:20:59,206
It's really unpredictable

411
00:20:59,266 --> 00:21:00,607
who's going to be returning favors.

412
00:21:02,308 --> 00:21:05,389
It's a gamble, and so just help 100 people out

413
00:21:05,429 --> 00:21:06,950
because you never know who's gonna pay off

414
00:21:06,990 --> 00:21:08,691
in a big, pay back in a big way.

415
00:21:09,231 --> 00:21:11,312
For example, last year I came to GDC

416
00:21:11,653 --> 00:21:13,414
and I saw a talk at Lost Levels

417
00:21:13,534 --> 00:21:14,834
where I met Murray Lancashire

418
00:21:15,515 --> 00:21:16,955
who talked about explosion effects.

419
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:19,036
I invited him to come back to my office

420
00:21:19,056 --> 00:21:21,318
like I invite a lot of people to come just to do dev jam.

421
00:21:21,838 --> 00:21:23,299
But he ended up doing a critique

422
00:21:23,419 --> 00:21:24,599
of the explosions in my game

423
00:21:24,619 --> 00:21:27,561
that helped me bring up the polish to a better level.

424
00:21:28,481 --> 00:21:29,162
It's really valuable.

425
00:21:30,317 --> 00:21:33,459
So a lot of these things I've been talking about are a little bit crunchy granola,

426
00:21:33,499 --> 00:21:35,419
sort of kumbaya, like let's all help each other,

427
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:39,541
but there are some real risks when you're participating in this economy of favors.

428
00:21:40,141 --> 00:21:42,002
First of all, there are finite resources.

429
00:21:42,042 --> 00:21:43,763
So while games are not a finite resource,

430
00:21:44,023 --> 00:21:47,845
there are things like iTunes Features, Humble Bundle Inclusion,

431
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:49,125
or the Steam Top Ten list.

432
00:21:49,545 --> 00:21:52,827
I mean, there's ten slots on the Steam Top Ten list that's pretty finite,

433
00:21:53,067 --> 00:21:54,528
and we're all competing for them globally.

434
00:21:55,335 --> 00:21:59,017
You can mitigate risks with this by doing things, for example,

435
00:21:59,137 --> 00:22:01,359
staggering release dates with your tribe members

436
00:22:01,479 --> 00:22:02,659
so you're not stomping on each other.

437
00:22:04,881 --> 00:22:06,061
Also, work-life balance.

438
00:22:06,261 --> 00:22:08,442
You might not notice, but this is a Venn diagram.

439
00:22:11,064 --> 00:22:13,505
So it's really hard to maintain a work-life balance

440
00:22:13,565 --> 00:22:15,766
if you're engaging in this because you're doing business

441
00:22:15,786 --> 00:22:16,387
with your friends.

442
00:22:17,567 --> 00:22:19,728
I had one thing happen to me that was sort of unfortunate.

443
00:22:20,029 --> 00:22:21,850
My game launched right around the time of Gamergate.

444
00:22:23,203 --> 00:22:26,406
And what happened was I had press people I had reached out to

445
00:22:26,726 --> 00:22:31,670
who had actually committed to doing reviews at major publications about my game.

446
00:22:32,670 --> 00:22:34,472
But after Gamergate they said,

447
00:22:34,512 --> 00:22:36,833
you know, I think we're too close, I'm not going to review your game.

448
00:22:38,014 --> 00:22:41,036
And I get it, as an indie, your game is an expression of yourself

449
00:22:41,477 --> 00:22:42,718
and it can feel very personal.

450
00:22:43,098 --> 00:22:45,700
But it also felt like a damned if you do, damned if you don't situation

451
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:48,842
because either they don't know about you or they think you're too close.

452
00:22:50,372 --> 00:22:51,113
So that can be tricky.

453
00:22:51,813 --> 00:22:54,014
Also, you'll have to relax control.

454
00:22:55,374 --> 00:22:56,895
When you're engaging in favor exchange

455
00:22:56,915 --> 00:22:59,176
with people who don't have equity in your company

456
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:00,316
and are not getting paid,

457
00:23:00,616 --> 00:23:02,137
you can't expect the same kind of work.

458
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,138
You're not making the same choices

459
00:23:04,178 --> 00:23:06,079
that you would make if you had a million dollar budget.

460
00:23:06,979 --> 00:23:08,620
But part of that scrappy charm

461
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:12,481
that's part of an indie game can come from that.

462
00:23:13,622 --> 00:23:15,042
And the final risk I wanna touch on

463
00:23:15,082 --> 00:23:16,263
is the risk of homogeneity.

464
00:23:17,207 --> 00:23:18,427
So I keep saying the word tribes.

465
00:23:18,968 --> 00:23:20,068
It's a really positive word,

466
00:23:20,549 --> 00:23:23,130
but tribes are also clicks, and clicks can be clicky.

467
00:23:23,891 --> 00:23:26,152
There's a real threat of gildification.

468
00:23:26,473 --> 00:23:27,453
So if you're on the outside,

469
00:23:27,473 --> 00:23:29,815
you feel like you're looking in, you can't get anywhere.

470
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:32,777
Also, I think as game developers,

471
00:23:32,977 --> 00:23:35,699
we have a responsibility to represent a broad spectrum

472
00:23:35,839 --> 00:23:37,700
of perspectives in the games that we're making.

473
00:23:38,380 --> 00:23:41,142
So just be mindful to be inclusive with your tribes.

474
00:23:44,200 --> 00:23:46,261
And I see that the future of indie development

475
00:23:46,701 --> 00:23:48,142
is going to get more and more

476
00:23:48,182 --> 00:23:50,363
into this interdependent dynamic,

477
00:23:50,863 --> 00:23:53,804
because as there's an injection of veteran wisdom

478
00:23:53,944 --> 00:23:55,805
and capital with things like Indie Fund,

479
00:23:57,225 --> 00:23:59,546
it's gonna raise the bar on what indies can accomplish,

480
00:24:00,786 --> 00:24:02,687
but it also encourages interreliance,

481
00:24:03,067 --> 00:24:05,588
because it's, again, raising that pressure

482
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:06,849
on what an indie can deliver.

483
00:24:06,869 --> 00:24:10,230
So that puts more tension on the pressure

484
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:13,271
between interdependent and independent game development.

485
00:24:15,324 --> 00:24:18,165
So today I've shared some of my resources with you guys,

486
00:24:18,666 --> 00:24:21,507
and I hope that one day you will return the favor

487
00:24:22,047 --> 00:24:24,648
or help someone else and establish

488
00:24:24,728 --> 00:24:25,969
an exchange of favors with them.

489
00:24:27,349 --> 00:24:28,230
Well, that is my talk.

490
00:24:28,670 --> 00:24:29,610
Does anyone have questions?

491
00:24:29,630 --> 00:24:29,910
Yes.

492
00:24:29,930 --> 00:24:30,611
Thank you.

493
00:24:30,631 --> 00:24:31,051
Thank you.

494
00:24:31,091 --> 00:24:31,671
Thank you.

495
00:24:31,691 --> 00:24:31,971
Thank you.

496
00:24:31,991 --> 00:24:32,191
Thank you.

497
00:24:32,232 --> 00:24:32,552
Thank you.

498
00:24:32,572 --> 00:24:33,092
Thank you.

499
00:24:33,112 --> 00:24:33,692
Thank you.

500
00:24:33,712 --> 00:24:34,152
Thank you.

501
00:24:34,292 --> 00:24:34,693
Thank you.

502
00:24:34,713 --> 00:24:34,953
Thank you.

503
00:24:34,993 --> 00:24:35,473
Thank you.

504
00:24:35,493 --> 00:24:36,053
Thank you.

505
00:24:36,073 --> 00:24:36,353
Thank you.

506
00:24:36,373 --> 00:24:36,673
Thank you.

507
00:24:36,693 --> 00:24:36,954
Thank you.

508
00:24:36,994 --> 00:24:37,614
Thank you.

509
00:24:53,273 --> 00:24:54,114
This mic, try again.

510
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:54,935
Hello?

511
00:24:55,255 --> 00:24:55,455
Okay.

512
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:55,695
Okay.

513
00:24:56,396 --> 00:25:00,059
If you have a close friend who makes a bad game and asks you to promote it, what do you

514
00:25:00,099 --> 00:25:00,139
do?

515
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:00,660
Oh, man, that's a tough one.

516
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:00,720
Um.

517
00:25:00,740 --> 00:25:00,980
I don't know.

518
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:01,261
I don't know.

519
00:25:01,281 --> 00:25:01,521
I don't know.

520
00:25:01,541 --> 00:25:01,781
I don't know.

521
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:02,041
I don't know.

522
00:25:02,061 --> 00:25:02,301
I don't know.

523
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:02,602
I don't know.

524
00:25:02,622 --> 00:25:02,862
I don't know.

525
00:25:02,882 --> 00:25:03,122
I don't know.

526
00:25:03,142 --> 00:25:03,382
I don't know.

527
00:25:03,403 --> 00:25:03,663
I don't know.

528
00:25:03,947 --> 00:25:07,488
Well, I think you can always scale how much you do promote.

529
00:25:07,748 --> 00:25:09,428
Like, I think it's really important to be genuine.

530
00:25:09,808 --> 00:25:12,209
You don't want to promote something that you're not excited about

531
00:25:12,409 --> 00:25:15,729
because you're going to sort of burn bridges with your personal connections,

532
00:25:15,749 --> 00:25:16,910
the people who pay attention to you.

533
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,910
But in the interest of goodwill, I think it's good to,

534
00:25:21,330 --> 00:25:24,311
unless it's something you're absolutely against,

535
00:25:24,391 --> 00:25:27,852
like maybe it's got something horrible like racism or sexism involved,

536
00:25:28,392 --> 00:25:30,312
I think you could lift a finger and do something,

537
00:25:32,053 --> 00:25:33,513
but maybe not go completely all out.

538
00:25:34,995 --> 00:25:35,135
Thanks.

539
00:25:35,696 --> 00:25:35,856
Yes?

540
00:25:37,417 --> 00:25:42,541
Hello, I just, a lot of the things you mentioned are, San Francisco's a great area because

541
00:25:42,561 --> 00:25:45,523
you'll have a lot of these resources like the venues and things like that.

542
00:25:45,924 --> 00:25:46,164
Yeah.

543
00:25:46,244 --> 00:25:50,727
Do you have any suggestions for people who are in communities that don't really have

544
00:25:50,747 --> 00:25:57,793
those kind of like shared workspaces or eSports bars and stuff like that?

545
00:25:58,778 --> 00:26:03,082
Yeah, at San Francisco we are pretty lucky to have a lot, a lot of this going on.

546
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:08,926
I think it is really valuable for people like yourself who want to get involved in something

547
00:26:08,946 --> 00:26:09,907
like that to start it.

548
00:26:11,308 --> 00:26:13,069
This stuff is all really grassroots.

549
00:26:13,269 --> 00:26:15,371
There aren't big organizations who are forming it.

550
00:26:15,431 --> 00:26:19,634
It's all people like you who are saying, oh, there's a need for this in my community.

551
00:26:19,654 --> 00:26:21,375
I'm going to step up and do it.

552
00:26:22,196 --> 00:26:26,479
I know it can seem daunting because it can seem like, look, I'm not here to build a tribe.

553
00:26:26,539 --> 00:26:27,260
I'm here to make a game.

554
00:26:27,914 --> 00:26:34,057
But I really do think that the payoff is going to make it worth it to yourself and to the people in your area.

555
00:26:34,998 --> 00:26:35,278
Thank you.

556
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:37,299
Yes.

557
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:46,363
Your greatest dream happens in your game is like the next Angry Birds or something, and it makes a lot of money.

558
00:26:46,583 --> 00:26:48,884
And you had a lot of volunteers working on your game.

559
00:26:49,625 --> 00:26:52,106
There's gonna be questions of ownership and.

560
00:26:53,383 --> 00:26:58,532
rev share. I mean as soon as big money gets in the mix, how do you plan on that? I mean

561
00:26:58,552 --> 00:27:03,180
what's the best way to protect yourself and your intellectual property from, you know,

562
00:27:03,341 --> 00:27:05,705
legal claims later if you have a huge hit?

563
00:27:07,613 --> 00:27:13,697
I think that while indie developers are probably not super savvy legally,

564
00:27:14,637 --> 00:27:22,462
establishing a business model and having a basic contract with anyone you're working with on that

565
00:27:22,522 --> 00:27:24,363
who's going to be making money is really important.

566
00:27:26,064 --> 00:27:31,266
and that way it can help you distinguish between who's going to make money and and who's not and

567
00:27:31,506 --> 00:27:37,428
and be really up front with people like when I'm talking about these exchanges of favor like

568
00:27:38,068 --> 00:27:40,109
there I'm not talking about any kind of like

569
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:45,041
unclear situation as to whether someone's going to make money or not, because I think

570
00:27:45,061 --> 00:27:46,883
that could be really immoral.

571
00:27:48,163 --> 00:27:50,024
So yeah, just be really upfront about it.

572
00:27:50,084 --> 00:27:55,407
I think that if someone hasn't agreed to give you money, you shouldn't expect money for

573
00:27:55,427 --> 00:27:56,108
the things you do.

574
00:27:59,510 --> 00:28:01,091
And, like, you know, in writing.

575
00:28:03,292 --> 00:28:03,472
Yes?

576
00:28:03,952 --> 00:28:04,593
Hi.

577
00:28:04,653 --> 00:28:05,173
Great talk.

578
00:28:05,573 --> 00:28:05,853
Thank you.

579
00:28:06,734 --> 00:28:09,616
Up until which point do you think that...

580
00:28:10,646 --> 00:28:13,508
you can say, okay, this person is someone I trust.

581
00:28:13,908 --> 00:28:15,409
How do you measure that?

582
00:28:15,469 --> 00:28:17,470
How do you realize it?

583
00:28:17,910 --> 00:28:22,393
Okay, I can trust this person with my sweat and blood,

584
00:28:22,493 --> 00:28:24,854
you know, like I can trust them with my project,

585
00:28:24,894 --> 00:28:26,315
so okay, here is,

586
00:28:26,715 --> 00:28:29,597
because it's not just something of asking for a favor,

587
00:28:29,637 --> 00:28:30,877
because you're actually giving them

588
00:28:31,198 --> 00:28:32,979
a lot of what you have been doing,

589
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:36,201
and encouraging them to do something with that.

590
00:28:36,261 --> 00:28:38,702
So to which point can you say,

591
00:28:38,722 --> 00:28:39,963
these guys are my friends?

592
00:28:41,426 --> 00:28:49,269
Right. That's a good question. So I think that when you're forming a company as an indie,

593
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:56,111
figuring out who's actually an employee is a culling process where you're going to figure

594
00:28:56,151 --> 00:29:00,952
out who do I super duper trust because this is, you know, this is basically my money because my

595
00:29:00,992 --> 00:29:05,754
time is my money in the project we're working on. I think there are situations where

596
00:29:07,104 --> 00:29:09,993
you're not gonna have enough knowledge in advance

597
00:29:10,034 --> 00:29:11,258
when someone's offering to help you.

598
00:29:13,372 --> 00:29:18,454
I did have a scenario where someone offered to do some promotional video work for Canon Brawl

599
00:29:19,015 --> 00:29:21,996
and I said, great, you know, that sounds awesome, thank you.

600
00:29:22,556 --> 00:29:29,620
And the videos were not something that I would necessarily want to put out there professionally,

601
00:29:30,820 --> 00:29:34,542
but because I hadn't made any promises and I had just been encouraging,

602
00:29:34,562 --> 00:29:40,785
I think it was okay to dial back the level of, sort of, publicity that I was willing to give those videos.

603
00:29:41,406 --> 00:29:46,608
So I think you can do things like that where if there's an unknown as to how much you can

604
00:29:46,648 --> 00:29:54,732
trust someone, just either be up front about it and say, we'll see how this goes, and if

605
00:29:54,792 --> 00:29:57,574
it's great material, I'll use it.

606
00:29:57,814 --> 00:30:02,476
Give yourself a way to exit, don't corner yourself in, if that makes sense to people.

607
00:30:03,016 --> 00:30:03,336
Thank you.

608
00:30:04,237 --> 00:30:04,597
Yes, go ahead.

609
00:30:04,617 --> 00:30:06,818
Great topic.

610
00:30:06,858 --> 00:30:07,098
Thank you.

611
00:30:07,118 --> 00:30:09,800
Thanks for your presentation.

612
00:30:10,435 --> 00:30:13,722
Did, for people who are starting their first startups,

613
00:30:13,843 --> 00:30:16,508
is there any books or resources that you'd suggest

614
00:30:16,649 --> 00:30:19,876
for things that we might not think about

615
00:30:20,437 --> 00:30:21,679
or not know that we don't know?

616
00:30:23,317 --> 00:30:25,359
I don't know of any particular books,

617
00:30:25,459 --> 00:30:27,880
and I think the reason for that is

618
00:30:28,561 --> 00:30:30,682
partially because it's such a new thing,

619
00:30:30,702 --> 00:30:35,805
at least as far as the volume of people in the indie space.

620
00:30:36,966 --> 00:30:38,107
So really, your best resources

621
00:30:38,147 --> 00:30:39,548
are gonna be other indie developers,

622
00:30:40,028 --> 00:30:41,429
or other startup developers.

623
00:30:42,109 --> 00:30:43,750
Okay, and how about on this subject

624
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:46,452
of gift sharing, economy-based?

625
00:30:47,594 --> 00:30:53,197
I just had someone actually, I just had someone recommend some material to me, but I haven't

626
00:30:53,238 --> 00:30:58,981
read it and it was, um, you know what, I'll try and put it in my slide notes afterwards.

627
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:02,323
So if you want to download, cause I'm not, I don't want to say the wrong name right now.

628
00:31:02,383 --> 00:31:02,703
All good.

629
00:31:02,783 --> 00:31:03,103
Thank you.

630
00:31:03,324 --> 00:31:03,484
Yeah.

631
00:31:06,946 --> 00:31:08,627
Well, that's basically it.

632
00:31:08,727 --> 00:31:10,148
So thank you guys so much for attending.
