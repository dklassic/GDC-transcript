00:00:05,887 --> 00:00:07,028
Welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:07,028 --> 00:00:10,649
Very happy to have you here today about my talk,

3
00:00:10,649 --> 00:00:14,391
Why Forums Can Be Great for Indie Community

4
00:00:14,391 --> 00:00:15,531
and Discoverability.

5
00:00:15,531 --> 00:00:18,432
A quick intro, I am Philomena.

6
00:00:18,432 --> 00:00:22,274
I am the co-founder and game designer at Strayfawn Studio.

7
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:25,315
We are an indie studio located in Zurich, Switzerland,

8
00:00:25,315 --> 00:00:27,656
currently consisting of 10 people.

9
00:00:28,777 --> 00:00:35,479
And we concept and develop and publish our own premium PC games.

10
00:00:35,479 --> 00:00:39,180
So we're an indie game studio which tries to make the games that they love

11
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:44,522
and also try to push them out and see if the world is actually interested in them.

12
00:00:44,522 --> 00:00:46,683
So we released two games so far.

13
00:00:46,683 --> 00:00:49,664
The first one is called Niche, a genetic survival game.

14
00:00:49,664 --> 00:00:53,825
And the second one is called Nimbatus, the Space Drone Constructor.

15
00:00:54,665 --> 00:01:01,831
And both of these games are very much focused on procedural generation and our simulation games.

16
00:01:01,831 --> 00:01:06,075
So this allows us to focus heavily on community-based development.

17
00:01:06,075 --> 00:01:10,679
So we always like check in with people, what they would like to see added next,

18
00:01:10,679 --> 00:01:13,801
and what feedback they may have, and what should be improved.

19
00:01:13,801 --> 00:01:19,906
And today I want to tell you about forums and about community hubs in general.

20
00:01:21,110 --> 00:01:27,111
What you will take away from this session is what community hubs are currently popular.

21
00:01:27,111 --> 00:01:33,173
I did a survey with 100 indie studios and like small teams from all over the world to

22
00:01:33,173 --> 00:01:39,515
see what they are currently using as a community hub and what are the benefits and the problems

23
00:01:39,515 --> 00:01:39,995
with these hubs.

24
00:01:39,995 --> 00:01:48,037
And I want to tell you the story on why all of these options our studio actually in the

25
00:01:48,037 --> 00:01:49,157
end went with a forum.

26
00:01:49,877 --> 00:01:53,960
And once you have that forum, how to bring people in,

27
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,021
like also for other community hubs,

28
00:01:56,021 --> 00:01:57,422
but especially with a forum,

29
00:01:57,422 --> 00:01:59,604
that's probably the biggest challenge

30
00:01:59,604 --> 00:02:01,165
when trying to build that up.

31
00:02:02,162 --> 00:02:04,723
So let's start off with some numbers

32
00:02:04,723 --> 00:02:07,984
and what indie developers have said about community hubs

33
00:02:07,984 --> 00:02:09,204
and community building.

34
00:02:09,204 --> 00:02:12,545
So the first question was, is community building actually

35
00:02:12,545 --> 00:02:15,546
relevant for a game's financial success?

36
00:02:15,546 --> 00:02:20,527
And you can see 96% I was surprised by this number.

37
00:02:20,527 --> 00:02:22,848
96% of people actually said yes.

38
00:02:22,848 --> 00:02:26,028
They believe that if a game has a community, that can actually

39
00:02:26,028 --> 00:02:30,110
impact your launch visibility and your financial success

40
00:02:30,110 --> 00:02:30,730
with the game.

41
00:02:32,264 --> 00:02:38,328
I wanted to know if people are running their community hubs around their game, around their

42
00:02:38,328 --> 00:02:39,428
studio or both.

43
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:44,551
You can see that usually studios are focused about communicating about their game.

44
00:02:44,551 --> 00:02:48,173
Some had it about their studio and a couple had it about both.

45
00:02:48,534 --> 00:02:52,675
And now we wonder, what are those community hubs actually?

46
00:02:52,675 --> 00:02:55,957
So where are people currently bringing their fans

47
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:57,197
to interact with them?

48
00:02:57,197 --> 00:03:00,098
And you can see that, not surprisingly,

49
00:03:00,098 --> 00:03:03,040
Discord is like almost 50% of the people.

50
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,641
Discord is currently very, very popular.

51
00:03:05,641 --> 00:03:10,943
It has spread like wildfire in the last half a year or so.

52
00:03:10,983 --> 00:03:14,544
Basically half of the indie developers are using Discord as a community hub.

53
00:03:14,544 --> 00:03:18,605
You can see that for the people that are developing PC games,

54
00:03:18,605 --> 00:03:22,026
Steam forums are also a very big option.

55
00:03:22,026 --> 00:03:26,267
Facebook groups are still around, not so much anymore,

56
00:03:26,267 --> 00:03:29,628
but still quite a few people use Facebook groups.

57
00:03:29,628 --> 00:03:32,368
And some people have other options,

58
00:03:32,368 --> 00:03:36,049
and quite a couple of people actually don't have a main community hub,

59
00:03:36,049 --> 00:03:37,350
but have different ones.

60
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:39,570
So they said they don't have one specific hub.

61
00:03:40,709 --> 00:03:43,795
What I found a bit odd in the survey was,

62
00:03:43,795 --> 00:03:46,620
like in this gray part, there were quite a few people

63
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:48,724
who said Twitter is their main community hub.

64
00:03:48,724 --> 00:03:52,812
And I was like, is Twitter even a community hub?

65
00:03:53,234 --> 00:03:57,317
because for example with YouTube and with Twitter it looks more like this,

66
00:03:57,317 --> 00:04:01,702
like you are the developer and you tell people about all the cool things you're adding to your

67
00:04:01,702 --> 00:04:06,926
game and they're just basically listening to you and maybe interacting with you but not so much

68
00:04:06,926 --> 00:04:11,110
interacting with each other because the only opportunity they have to do that is like in the

69
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:16,956
comments of your tweets which doesn't give them enough space kind of and the community hub should

70
00:04:16,956 --> 00:04:18,177
actually be a place where

71
00:04:18,437 --> 00:04:24,187
people are interacting with each other and can share what they have created for your game and so forth.

72
00:04:24,187 --> 00:04:29,617
So if Twitter is your main community hub, maybe consider moving to one like Discord

73
00:04:29,617 --> 00:04:32,041
where people can actually interact with each other better.

74
00:04:34,195 --> 00:04:38,078
So then I wanted to know why do you use this community hub?

75
00:04:38,078 --> 00:04:44,183
And for Discord the answer was that it was very easy to set up and use and also free.

76
00:04:44,183 --> 00:04:49,827
People already have accounts so you don't need to bring them to any site and they don't need to set up a new account.

77
00:04:50,587 --> 00:04:52,048
platform independence.

78
00:04:52,048 --> 00:04:54,209
So if you only have your game on Steam,

79
00:04:54,209 --> 00:04:55,569
Steam forums is fine,

80
00:04:55,569 --> 00:04:58,350
but if you also have it on like PlayStation 4

81
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:00,571
or like another PC store like GOT,

82
00:05:00,571 --> 00:05:02,812
people don't want to come to your Steam forum,

83
00:05:02,812 --> 00:05:04,272
so it's great to have a Discord

84
00:05:04,272 --> 00:05:06,893
because it's platform independent.

85
00:05:06,893 --> 00:05:08,614
And they really appreciate the chat feature

86
00:05:08,614 --> 00:05:10,775
so that people can both with the devs

87
00:05:10,775 --> 00:05:13,456
and with each other like communicate very quickly,

88
00:05:13,456 --> 00:05:15,817
which for example for bug reports helps a lot

89
00:05:15,817 --> 00:05:16,697
when you can just like.

90
00:05:17,437 --> 00:05:20,761
chat back and forth until you figure out the problem together.

91
00:05:20,761 --> 00:05:24,124
And people really appreciate bots about Discord.

92
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:28,809
So especially things that you can apply roles to people

93
00:05:28,809 --> 00:05:32,313
or also run giveaways way more easily than you have to, like,

94
00:05:32,313 --> 00:05:35,556
do random numbers and figure out who actually is the winner of the giveaways.

95
00:05:35,556 --> 00:05:36,718
You can just do it with a bot.

96
00:05:37,707 --> 00:05:41,069
With Steam, people said, yeah, you have it automatically

97
00:05:41,069 --> 00:05:43,671
and it's free, and you have to maintain it anyways,

98
00:05:43,671 --> 00:05:46,693
because if people are posting bug reports in the Steam

99
00:05:46,693 --> 00:05:49,535
forums, they expect you to come and reply to them.

100
00:05:49,535 --> 00:05:53,738
And it may influence the purchase decision of a game.

101
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:56,700
So people may are not sure if they should buy the game,

102
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:58,561
and then they go to the Steam forums

103
00:05:58,561 --> 00:06:00,823
and read a bit what the general mood is in there.

104
00:06:00,823 --> 00:06:01,924
Are people liking the game?

105
00:06:01,924 --> 00:06:05,166
Maybe they ask a question, and if they get a good reply,

106
00:06:05,166 --> 00:06:07,248
maybe it influences if they will buy the game.

107
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,175
And with Facebook groups, also again,

108
00:06:11,175 --> 00:06:12,917
people already have accounts.

109
00:06:12,917 --> 00:06:15,298
And very interesting here is that compared

110
00:06:15,298 --> 00:06:17,640
to all the other hubs, for example, with Discord,

111
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:20,722
you just have like your set community size

112
00:06:20,722 --> 00:06:22,183
and you can never like extend it.

113
00:06:22,183 --> 00:06:23,564
You can never like make a post

114
00:06:23,564 --> 00:06:26,787
and then it goes viral into other Discords.

115
00:06:26,787 --> 00:06:28,688
But with a public Facebook group,

116
00:06:28,688 --> 00:06:30,009
if you make an interesting post

117
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:31,650
and a lot of people share it,

118
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:33,912
you have the possibility for it to go viral,

119
00:06:33,912 --> 00:06:35,473
which is not the case with the other hubs.

120
00:06:36,014 --> 00:06:39,997
And also because people are very familiar with Facebook,

121
00:06:39,997 --> 00:06:41,678
both devs and users,

122
00:06:41,678 --> 00:06:44,840
and they just like hanging out on Facebook.

123
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:48,743
And then the question is, what other use,

124
00:06:48,743 --> 00:06:51,786
what other hubs do you also use alongside your main hub?

125
00:06:51,786 --> 00:06:54,868
So we can see quite a lot of people also,

126
00:06:54,868 --> 00:06:56,990
like as a side hub, also use the...

127
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,693
Steam forums, again, because you have to, kind of.

128
00:07:01,693 --> 00:07:03,874
Facebook's also still very much in use,

129
00:07:03,874 --> 00:07:07,057
and people say that often they have started

130
00:07:07,057 --> 00:07:08,538
their community building there,

131
00:07:08,538 --> 00:07:10,780
and they have just, they have moved on to Discord,

132
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:13,402
but they still keep their Facebook page alive

133
00:07:13,402 --> 00:07:16,284
because it still has some decent traffic going on.

134
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:19,166
Here, for the first time, we see subreddits.

135
00:07:19,166 --> 00:07:21,768
So people think that, or a lot of developers think

136
00:07:21,768 --> 00:07:24,110
that their target audience is actually there,

137
00:07:24,110 --> 00:07:26,252
and that they should go there in order to reach them.

138
00:07:27,112 --> 00:07:32,818
A few people also have Discord as a site, Hub, and a few have forums.

139
00:07:32,818 --> 00:07:39,005
So we have seen forums are not that popular, at least not that popular anymore, and I wondered

140
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:44,830
why that is, and if people have even considered forums as an option, and you can see that

141
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:47,753
a lot of people say, no, it doesn't really fit our needs, or...

142
00:07:48,491 --> 00:07:52,753
A lot of people also say we have actually never thought about that as an option at all.

143
00:07:52,753 --> 00:07:58,375
A few people have a forum, some are thinking about it and some had one but closed it

144
00:07:58,375 --> 00:08:04,937
because they found that it doesn't meet their needs anymore and doesn't keep up with the more recent options.

145
00:08:06,153 --> 00:08:08,474
So why not have a forum?

146
00:08:08,474 --> 00:08:10,155
So people said, it doesn't really

147
00:08:10,155 --> 00:08:12,937
make sense for small games and small studios

148
00:08:12,937 --> 00:08:16,039
because you have to bring in all the traffic by yourself.

149
00:08:16,039 --> 00:08:19,881
And all the needs are already fulfilled by Steam Forums

150
00:08:19,881 --> 00:08:20,902
and by Discord.

151
00:08:20,902 --> 00:08:22,763
It's very hard to opt in.

152
00:08:22,763 --> 00:08:24,724
People need to make an account.

153
00:08:24,724 --> 00:08:26,025
And it's hard to gain traffic.

154
00:08:26,025 --> 00:08:28,927
And it's also, it costs something usually.

155
00:08:28,927 --> 00:08:30,708
And it's an effort to maintain it,

156
00:08:30,708 --> 00:08:32,869
like if somebody does a spam post and so on.

157
00:08:32,869 --> 00:08:35,010
So very high maintenance.

158
00:08:36,319 --> 00:08:39,900
There were also some voices that said, yes, forums are absolutely great,

159
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:44,101
because they're the best structure for long and in-depth discussions.

160
00:08:44,101 --> 00:08:48,643
I don't know if you have had that, but in Discord, if you're actually trying

161
00:08:48,643 --> 00:08:53,204
to find a specific conversation somewhere, it's sometimes quite hard.

162
00:08:53,204 --> 00:08:54,885
And then like two people are discussing

163
00:08:54,885 --> 00:08:57,805
about something and then just somebody else jumps in and say,

164
00:08:57,805 --> 00:08:59,466
how are you doing today?

165
00:08:59,466 --> 00:09:02,987
And then suddenly the conversation shifts

166
00:09:02,987 --> 00:09:05,588
and the in-depth discussion is maybe interrupted.

167
00:09:06,943 --> 00:09:11,806
With a forum you have full control and you can apply your own rules.

168
00:09:11,806 --> 00:09:17,190
Many people say it's the best way to collect user feedback and bugs,

169
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:22,394
and not only that, but also to archive it so that you can look it up very easily again.

170
00:09:22,394 --> 00:09:28,338
And people said that it makes sense if the studio is big or the studio has more than one game,

171
00:09:28,338 --> 00:09:30,219
because then it can cross-promote each other.

172
00:09:31,645 --> 00:09:34,350
So these were the voices of 100 indie developers,

173
00:09:34,350 --> 00:09:38,218
and now I want to tell you our story of why we actually

174
00:09:38,218 --> 00:09:39,782
decided to go with the forum.

175
00:09:41,061 --> 00:09:46,262
So our studio was just working on its first game, which is called Niche.

176
00:09:46,262 --> 00:09:50,664
And at the very beginning, when it was just a prototype, we opened up a Facebook group

177
00:09:50,664 --> 00:09:54,265
because we thought, yeah, that's the place our audience is.

178
00:09:54,265 --> 00:09:59,266
And then we said, yeah, maybe also let's add a Twitter to reach more people.

179
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:02,447
And then we went to events and started gathering email addresses.

180
00:10:02,447 --> 00:10:03,868
So let's also have a newsletter.

181
00:10:04,608 --> 00:10:06,529
And then we did a Kickstarter, and then, yeah,

182
00:10:06,529 --> 00:10:09,411
we also have to update our backers about all the new things

183
00:10:09,411 --> 00:10:10,492
we're doing now.

184
00:10:10,492 --> 00:10:12,773
And then we did Steam Early Access launch,

185
00:10:12,773 --> 00:10:15,355
and then the Steam forums were also a new channel

186
00:10:15,355 --> 00:10:17,256
we had to communicate on.

187
00:10:17,256 --> 00:10:19,157
And then people opened the Discord

188
00:10:19,157 --> 00:10:21,999
and kind of expected us to drop in from time to time.

189
00:10:21,999 --> 00:10:24,761
Then we opened a YouTube channel because we

190
00:10:24,761 --> 00:10:27,363
had regular videos whenever we did an update.

191
00:10:27,363 --> 00:10:29,764
And then people opened a subreddit,

192
00:10:29,764 --> 00:10:33,266
and it expected us also to check in from time to time.

193
00:10:33,707 --> 00:10:35,367
And we did an Instagram, because everybody

194
00:10:35,367 --> 00:10:36,447
said Instagram is cool.

195
00:10:36,447 --> 00:10:38,588
So why not another one?

196
00:10:38,588 --> 00:10:41,709
And after that, we started also working

197
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,850
on our second game, which is Nimbatus.

198
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,331
And there, we basically started with a Twitter.

199
00:10:47,331 --> 00:10:49,371
It's the whole story all over again,

200
00:10:49,371 --> 00:10:51,092
but just a bit different.

201
00:10:51,092 --> 00:10:53,352
So here we thought a subreddit is better,

202
00:10:53,352 --> 00:10:55,893
because it fits the target audience better.

203
00:10:55,893 --> 00:10:57,654
Then the Discord happened.

204
00:10:57,654 --> 00:10:58,834
The Kickstarter happened.

205
00:10:59,154 --> 00:11:05,041
the email list happened, then we also started like posting an image, like kind of a dev insights,

206
00:11:05,041 --> 00:11:11,748
whenever we had like a new update with the early access launch came the steam forums, youtube,

207
00:11:11,748 --> 00:11:13,831
you see, so at least

208
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:20,114
At latest, after your second game, you will have a lot of places where people are actually

209
00:11:20,114 --> 00:11:23,796
expecting you to communicate and to react to them.

210
00:11:23,796 --> 00:11:29,918
And we were a bit overwhelmed by all of this and thought, yeah, maybe we can do this studio-based

211
00:11:29,918 --> 00:11:31,239
community thing, right?

212
00:11:31,239 --> 00:11:32,380
So we don't have, like...

213
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,801
accounts on everything with every game.

214
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:40,284
So we looked into all of this huge pile of stuff

215
00:11:40,284 --> 00:11:42,925
where we had to communicate and thought, OK, which ones can

216
00:11:42,925 --> 00:11:44,646
we actually do studio-based?

217
00:11:44,646 --> 00:11:46,126
And we found some.

218
00:11:46,126 --> 00:11:49,328
So OK, Instagram and YouTube, we can do those studio-based

219
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:52,430
and just use it for both games and upload videos and stuff.

220
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:56,572
We can kind of do the newsletter and the Kickstarter

221
00:11:56,572 --> 00:11:59,693
studio-based, but we still have to communicate something

222
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:00,974
specifically for each game.

223
00:12:01,897 --> 00:12:05,359
And yeah, now that we're actually building up a presence for the studio,

224
00:12:05,359 --> 00:12:08,601
we actually also need a Twitter account for the studio and a Facebook account

225
00:12:08,601 --> 00:12:11,363
for the studio and the Discord for the studio.

226
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:14,646
And you can see that in the end, it was just even more community hubs.

227
00:12:14,646 --> 00:12:18,989
And then we decided to try and solve the problem.

228
00:12:19,669 --> 00:12:22,050
by adding even more community hubs.

229
00:12:22,050 --> 00:12:24,731
So we decided to open up the forum,

230
00:12:24,731 --> 00:12:28,733
but the approach this time was planned to be different.

231
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,094
So we wanted to basically have the forum

232
00:12:31,094 --> 00:12:33,274
as the main community hub for everything

233
00:12:33,274 --> 00:12:35,775
where people knew if they wanted to reach us,

234
00:12:35,775 --> 00:12:37,016
if they wanted to chat with us,

235
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:38,717
if they wanted all the infos,

236
00:12:38,717 --> 00:12:41,158
they have to come to the forums.

237
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:42,698
And like, just...

238
00:12:43,449 --> 00:12:51,735
manage the expectations that we will not be online everywhere and reacting within 24 hours on all these other platforms.

239
00:12:51,735 --> 00:12:54,497
So we looked around a bit and

240
00:12:54,497 --> 00:12:57,119
found a forum software called InVision.

241
00:12:57,119 --> 00:13:02,222
Actually, we decided on this one also because like the guys from Kerbal Space Program

242
00:13:02,903 --> 00:13:05,586
were using it and the guys from Don't Starve, so we thought,

243
00:13:05,586 --> 00:13:07,408
huh, all the big guys are using this software,

244
00:13:07,408 --> 00:13:09,030
so there must be something cool about it.

245
00:13:09,030 --> 00:13:11,332
And we looked into it more, and we

246
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:13,995
saw that it has a lot of options for plug-ins

247
00:13:13,995 --> 00:13:16,418
and a lot of cool features, which I will get to in a sec.

248
00:13:17,831 --> 00:13:23,479
And yeah, then we kind of were, yeah, are we really doing forums over like Steam forums,

249
00:13:23,479 --> 00:13:24,821
Facebook groups and Discord?

250
00:13:24,821 --> 00:13:29,228
And at this point, Steam forums were not really an option anymore because we were also selling

251
00:13:29,228 --> 00:13:30,730
the game on GOG.

252
00:13:30,730 --> 00:13:33,715
So we had to kind of have a place where these people could come.

253
00:13:34,420 --> 00:13:36,401
that dropped out as an option.

254
00:13:36,401 --> 00:13:40,141
Facebook groups, we felt that not all of our players,

255
00:13:40,141 --> 00:13:41,622
so especially with the second game,

256
00:13:41,622 --> 00:13:43,222
even have a Facebook account.

257
00:13:43,222 --> 00:13:44,902
And some said, no, I don't really want

258
00:13:44,902 --> 00:13:46,143
to hang out on Facebook.

259
00:13:46,143 --> 00:13:50,083
And Discord is great, but I'm also always a bit afraid

260
00:13:50,083 --> 00:13:52,584
that how long will these things last?

261
00:13:52,584 --> 00:13:55,864
So with a forum, you have a bit of a stability

262
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:58,205
because you will have people's email address

263
00:13:58,205 --> 00:14:00,585
and if they, for example, have a bug report.

264
00:14:01,126 --> 00:14:06,570
you will be pretty sure that you can reach them again because you have their email and you can reach out through that and

265
00:14:06,570 --> 00:14:11,954
Yeah, with Discord it suddenly popped up and I'm not sure will it still be there in a year or in two years

266
00:14:11,954 --> 00:14:19,719
maybe but maybe they also like decide to do something else with the company and then I will suddenly not have access to

267
00:14:19,719 --> 00:14:24,043
my community anymore which sucks and then I cannot like bring them to another place very well, maybe

268
00:14:25,405 --> 00:14:28,946
And also, the other big reason was that we now had two games,

269
00:14:28,946 --> 00:14:31,487
and we kind of wanted the people to mingle a bit.

270
00:14:31,487 --> 00:14:34,929
So if they played one game, many people played one game

271
00:14:34,929 --> 00:14:36,389
but didn't know about the second game,

272
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:39,491
also because the target audience was quite different.

273
00:14:39,491 --> 00:14:41,712
And we thought, yeah, maybe if we bring them in one place

274
00:14:41,712 --> 00:14:44,593
together and they chat with each other a bit,

275
00:14:44,593 --> 00:14:46,674
maybe they will also take a look at the other game

276
00:14:46,674 --> 00:14:49,235
and ultimately become fans of the studio.

277
00:14:50,474 --> 00:14:57,958
So after opening that forum, it basically went from very loud and we had to be everywhere to this.

278
00:14:57,958 --> 00:15:09,024
Like completely quiet, nobody is online and that was probably the biggest community management

279
00:15:09,024 --> 00:15:13,266
challenge or build-up challenge that we ever had compared to a Discord which is open it,

280
00:15:13,266 --> 00:15:17,248
here's the Discord, oh there's a hundred people I can chat with now, that's nice.

281
00:15:18,149 --> 00:15:23,132
And how did we actually try to make sure people visit the forums?

282
00:15:23,132 --> 00:15:25,914
So we were very happy with the features that the forum offered.

283
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:29,496
It was exactly the place where we wanted our community to be

284
00:15:29,496 --> 00:15:32,639
and we thought this will make our lives so much easier

285
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,921
if they are actually here and use all these features.

286
00:15:35,921 --> 00:15:37,942
But how to actually get them there?

287
00:15:38,997 --> 00:15:42,780
And one important thing was just relinking.

288
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:46,503
So in the Steam forums and on many other community platforms,

289
00:15:46,503 --> 00:15:49,485
we basically just had this little note that said, yeah,

290
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:53,048
hi, we sometimes come here and chat with you a little bit,

291
00:15:53,048 --> 00:15:56,190
but we're actually mostly only in our own forums.

292
00:15:56,190 --> 00:15:58,212
Yeah, we come here and check out your box.

293
00:15:58,212 --> 00:16:00,594
But other than that, if you want to chat, come over.

294
00:16:00,594 --> 00:16:02,615
We're online almost every day.

295
00:16:02,615 --> 00:16:05,097
And that was a very big relief to me,

296
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:05,978
because I felt like.

297
00:16:06,498 --> 00:16:11,760
Okay, now I don't have to reply to every question that is posted somewhere.

298
00:16:11,760 --> 00:16:18,703
And yeah, people can just, if they really want to chat, they can just do that extra step and come over to the forum,

299
00:16:18,703 --> 00:16:21,283
and then I will take the time and chat with them over there.

300
00:16:22,393 --> 00:16:26,376
And then we needed to make sure that people actually know that.

301
00:16:26,376 --> 00:16:30,220
So whenever we sent out a newsletter, we said, yeah.

302
00:16:30,220 --> 00:16:33,863
And if you want to discuss what we should add to the game next,

303
00:16:33,863 --> 00:16:34,804
click on there.

304
00:16:34,804 --> 00:16:35,885
Join us in the forums.

305
00:16:35,885 --> 00:16:36,685
Chat with us there.

306
00:16:37,326 --> 00:16:41,969
or whenever we released a new YouTube video with new content

307
00:16:41,969 --> 00:16:45,371
that we had just added to the game, we made it like a little overview video

308
00:16:45,371 --> 00:16:48,632
and said, yeah, if you want to check out the full list of patch notes,

309
00:16:48,632 --> 00:16:52,535
you can just do that in the forum. So always incentivize them to

310
00:16:52,535 --> 00:16:56,257
at least come check out the forum. You don't have to make an account, but maybe

311
00:16:56,257 --> 00:16:56,877
take a look at it.

312
00:16:58,384 --> 00:17:04,867
I think one of the most important things was a cool feature that a forum has, and we're

313
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:09,589
kind of trying to, like, we have seen all these different community hubs have benefits,

314
00:17:09,589 --> 00:17:10,149
right?

315
00:17:10,149 --> 00:17:13,790
So, with Reddit, for example, you have this very cool feature that you can up and down

316
00:17:13,790 --> 00:17:14,851
vote things.

317
00:17:14,851 --> 00:17:16,431
And we saw that, okay, the...

318
00:17:17,476 --> 00:17:19,698
Basically, the forum has a very similar feature

319
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:20,619
that we can use as this.

320
00:17:20,619 --> 00:17:25,003
And then we told people that if they have an idea for the game,

321
00:17:25,003 --> 00:17:27,825
they have to come to the forum, post it there,

322
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:30,587
and we will then look at the top 10 ideas

323
00:17:30,587 --> 00:17:31,888
from the last month or so.

324
00:17:31,888 --> 00:17:35,371
And this was also a big relief, because previously we

325
00:17:35,371 --> 00:17:39,235
had received emails that were this long with an idea.

326
00:17:39,235 --> 00:17:41,797
I was like, I could read feedback all day,

327
00:17:41,797 --> 00:17:43,859
or I could actually work on the game.

328
00:17:43,859 --> 00:17:45,040
And now I could just tell them.

329
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:53,188
If you want your idea considered, please post it in the forum and make it appealing so people will vote for it and then we will check it out.

330
00:17:53,188 --> 00:18:06,182
And so people also like started doing little doodles for their suggestions, so they get a lot of upvotes and that made it so much easier to like see what people are actually interested in adding to the game.

331
00:18:08,877 --> 00:18:13,241
Another thing that is cool about the forum is that you can show who is actually online.

332
00:18:13,241 --> 00:18:16,804
You can also do that with Discord, but for example in the Steam forums, people don't

333
00:18:16,804 --> 00:18:20,027
know if you're actually around or not, or if you're asleep.

334
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:26,432
So people knew, okay, now Philo and Micha are online, and we taught them how they can

335
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:27,333
tag us.

336
00:18:27,333 --> 00:18:31,577
And they even learned who is responsible for what over time.

337
00:18:31,577 --> 00:18:34,519
So if they have a gameplay question, they maybe tag me.

338
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:36,441
If they have a bug, they maybe tag Micha.

339
00:18:37,362 --> 00:18:44,270
And so I could just like every morning come online and check if I was tagged somewhere and if not, okay, everything is fine.

340
00:18:44,270 --> 00:18:46,053
They're busy.

341
00:18:46,053 --> 00:18:50,558
We also have a couple of moderators and they try to answer people's questions

342
00:18:50,558 --> 00:18:57,006
and if they can't find a solution then they tag us and we always know basically if there's somebody in need of our help.

343
00:18:58,439 --> 00:19:01,504
And yeah, not only that, but people, yeah,

344
00:19:01,504 --> 00:19:04,929
started to get to know us a bit more as people

345
00:19:04,929 --> 00:19:06,531
because they tagged us with our names.

346
00:19:06,531 --> 00:19:08,254
And also in the forum,

347
00:19:08,254 --> 00:19:10,216
you can have cool customization features.

348
00:19:10,216 --> 00:19:13,561
So we made all of the developers into emojis.

349
00:19:14,062 --> 00:19:16,744
that people started using and suddenly everybody knew,

350
00:19:16,744 --> 00:19:22,007
ah, Marcus does the art and ah, Claudio is the game,

351
00:19:22,007 --> 00:19:23,368
is the sound designer.

352
00:19:23,368 --> 00:19:25,670
And so they started to know us and our roles

353
00:19:25,670 --> 00:19:27,311
and our character a bit.

354
00:19:27,311 --> 00:19:30,714
And you can also do like a lot of customization

355
00:19:30,714 --> 00:19:33,836
with the sub forums and people like really appreciate it

356
00:19:33,836 --> 00:19:36,117
when the things are like very much designed

357
00:19:36,117 --> 00:19:36,858
towards the game.

358
00:19:37,498 --> 00:19:43,782
And I think to this extent, I mean, you can even on Discord, you can have some customization,

359
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:51,706
but not as much as in the forum. With the sign up process, we try to make that easier with

360
00:19:51,706 --> 00:19:56,568
sign up plugins that you can like use your Twitter account or your Steam account.

361
00:19:57,282 --> 00:19:59,383
and even more useful plugins.

362
00:19:59,383 --> 00:20:01,204
So trying to bring all the best things

363
00:20:01,204 --> 00:20:02,625
from all the different community hubs.

364
00:20:02,625 --> 00:20:04,445
So for example, in Discord,

365
00:20:04,445 --> 00:20:06,526
people really appreciate those roles, right?

366
00:20:06,526 --> 00:20:08,787
So we looked around, is there maybe a plugin?

367
00:20:08,787 --> 00:20:10,788
And yes, there actually is one.

368
00:20:10,788 --> 00:20:12,389
So now we could, for example,

369
00:20:12,389 --> 00:20:15,590
give people the roles of Nimbatus tester.

370
00:20:15,590 --> 00:20:16,531
And then...

371
00:20:17,531 --> 00:20:21,693
if we had like a testing session coming up that was like urgent so we have to test this

372
00:20:21,693 --> 00:20:28,597
by tonight and see if it works then we can just do at Nimbatus tester and they even get an email

373
00:20:28,597 --> 00:20:33,860
so that's even stronger to like trigger them to come to the forum than it would

374
00:20:33,860 --> 00:20:35,601
be on discord where they get the discord ping.

375
00:20:36,182 --> 00:20:37,342
So that's great.

376
00:20:37,342 --> 00:20:39,244
And there's also some cool plugins, for example,

377
00:20:39,244 --> 00:20:40,124
for your newsletter.

378
00:20:40,124 --> 00:20:43,426
So with MailChimp, when people sign up to the forums,

379
00:20:43,426 --> 00:20:45,387
they can just check the box.

380
00:20:45,387 --> 00:20:47,028
And then they're also automatically

381
00:20:47,028 --> 00:20:51,571
added to your newsletter and get all the latest news.

382
00:20:51,571 --> 00:20:54,892
So other things we try to get the community going

383
00:20:54,892 --> 00:20:57,814
a little bit is we try to run a lot of giveaways.

384
00:20:57,814 --> 00:21:00,015
So every couple of weeks, we said,

385
00:21:00,015 --> 00:21:03,157
like on our other social media platforms, like on Twitter,

386
00:21:03,157 --> 00:21:04,938
we posted, hey, we're running a raffle.

387
00:21:05,719 --> 00:21:10,381
in our forums, so come on, make an account, post there,

388
00:21:10,381 --> 00:21:15,743
and we will give away a Steam key randomly between everybody who participated.

389
00:21:15,743 --> 00:21:19,364
And this actually got a lot of people to make an account, which was nice.

390
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:22,546
And then it's easier for them to come back.

391
00:21:22,846 --> 00:21:25,927
and check in again because then they will already have their account.

392
00:21:25,927 --> 00:21:30,129
So this helped a lot with bringing in new people and some then sticked around

393
00:21:30,129 --> 00:21:34,050
and looked at other things that have been posted and became members of the community.

394
00:21:34,050 --> 00:21:36,191
So we still do that pretty frequently.

395
00:21:36,191 --> 00:21:40,052
But it doesn't really matter how many people you bring in.

396
00:21:40,052 --> 00:21:44,574
In the end, it's really about how many people you can make stick around.

397
00:21:44,574 --> 00:21:48,196
So people that really want to stay in the forums and chat with people.

398
00:21:48,196 --> 00:21:51,937
And I think the best way to do this is to help people become friends.

399
00:21:52,497 --> 00:21:59,122
So in our forums, for example, for our first game, we have a lot of people that draw their characters

400
00:21:59,122 --> 00:22:05,227
and they have an art section and then they give each other tips on how they can improve their drawing skills.

401
00:22:05,227 --> 00:22:11,012
So suddenly the forum is not just about the game anymore, but has a completely new kind of value.

402
00:22:11,012 --> 00:22:13,253
So suddenly it's about improving your art.

403
00:22:14,214 --> 00:22:18,741
Or other people started a beauty contest of their creatures.

404
00:22:18,741 --> 00:22:23,628
So they posted screenshots and were judges of each other's breeding.

405
00:22:23,628 --> 00:22:27,834
And it was kind of like a cat show and they did it every month.

406
00:22:27,834 --> 00:22:29,756
And that was very cool.

407
00:22:30,811 --> 00:22:34,393
And I was very happy when people started picking up

408
00:22:34,393 --> 00:22:37,334
like random topics in the forum, because if they are only

409
00:22:37,334 --> 00:22:39,455
talking about your game, there's only so much

410
00:22:39,455 --> 00:22:40,455
they can talk about, right?

411
00:22:40,455 --> 00:22:43,037
So if you haven't released an update in a long time,

412
00:22:43,037 --> 00:22:45,778
maybe there's not so much to talk about anymore.

413
00:22:45,778 --> 00:22:49,399
And now they're just talking about Hamilton the musical

414
00:22:49,399 --> 00:22:51,801
and interesting biology stuff.

415
00:22:51,801 --> 00:22:56,122
So because they have met people that they enjoy chatting with,

416
00:22:56,122 --> 00:22:58,323
they can just now stick around and visit the forums

417
00:22:58,323 --> 00:22:59,584
and talk to their friends.

418
00:23:02,005 --> 00:23:05,990
So to sum this up a little bit, I have some numbers.

419
00:23:05,990 --> 00:23:10,775
We opened the forum around six, seven months ago,

420
00:23:10,775 --> 00:23:15,561
and so far around 3,700 people have registered,

421
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,484
and about 1,000 of them also signed up to the newsletter

422
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,606
with the plugin, which is nice.

423
00:23:21,207 --> 00:23:26,873
And around like 15 to 16 people are usually online at a given time of the day.

424
00:23:26,873 --> 00:23:32,338
So now people actually have somebody to interact with compared to the very beginning of the forums,

425
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:34,200
even though it was quite a bit of work.

426
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:39,485
Now it's actually quite consistent and we don't have to do so much anymore to bring in the traffic

427
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:42,748
because people are just stopping by to chat with their friends.

428
00:23:44,010 --> 00:23:46,953
So all in all, I would say it was a good decision,

429
00:23:46,953 --> 00:23:50,035
but I agree with the pros and contras

430
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:51,697
at the beginning of the talk,

431
00:23:51,697 --> 00:23:53,098
that it's not a good idea

432
00:23:53,098 --> 00:23:55,420
if you're working on your first game

433
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,701
and it's still very small,

434
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:59,864
and it will be very hard to also bring those people

435
00:23:59,864 --> 00:24:00,905
over to the forums.

436
00:24:01,345 --> 00:24:05,468
But if you have an already existing community of some size,

437
00:24:05,468 --> 00:24:07,129
then it might make sense.

438
00:24:07,129 --> 00:24:10,051
It made really a lot of sense now that we have two games,

439
00:24:10,051 --> 00:24:15,495
and people are really mingling and exchanging experiences from both games very well.

440
00:24:15,495 --> 00:24:21,519
For us, it has basically just made things so much more comfortable,

441
00:24:21,519 --> 00:24:24,901
and I enjoy our whole community management a lot more,

442
00:24:24,901 --> 00:24:28,023
since we have the forum and can check in there.

443
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:29,204
I can really recommend it.

444
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:35,694
So I hope you will keep building and growing your communities

445
00:24:35,694 --> 00:24:37,476
and have a lot of fun with them.

446
00:24:37,476 --> 00:24:38,077
Thank you.

447
00:24:38,077 --> 00:24:47,088
Do we have any questions?

448
00:24:54,119 --> 00:25:01,569
I run a rather large forum using the Zenforo software, and you mentioned you had done some research and ultimately settled on InVision.

449
00:25:01,569 --> 00:25:05,435
So I was wondering if you could speak to some of the advantages that InVision offers over the competition.

450
00:25:06,747 --> 00:25:12,573
Yeah, the question is why Envision is actually a nice software to use as a form software.

451
00:25:12,573 --> 00:25:15,997
I think because of the features it has inherently.

452
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:21,964
So with the whole up and down vote feature and also the back end is like very easy to

453
00:25:21,964 --> 00:25:26,929
use so you don't have to be a programmer to set up like your different chats and whatever.

454
00:25:27,590 --> 00:25:29,990
And yeah, there were a lot of plugins,

455
00:25:29,990 --> 00:25:34,512
and the plugin developers were quite active for it.

456
00:25:34,512 --> 00:25:38,733
And I also really like the basic design

457
00:25:38,733 --> 00:25:41,414
and how the site is structured.

458
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,254
I think it doesn't look so old-fashioned

459
00:25:43,254 --> 00:25:44,635
as other forums do.

460
00:25:44,635 --> 00:25:47,595
As a matter of the appearances,

461
00:25:47,595 --> 00:25:51,136
isn't that a matter of a front-end design?

462
00:25:51,136 --> 00:25:54,597
Isn't that something that you could customize

463
00:25:54,597 --> 00:25:56,118
regardless of the base software?

464
00:25:56,818 --> 00:25:59,860
Yeah, you can customize a lot of it.

465
00:25:59,860 --> 00:26:02,521
But for example, I was in charge of it,

466
00:26:02,521 --> 00:26:04,442
and I'm not a web programmer.

467
00:26:04,442 --> 00:26:07,184
And so I saw that I would save a lot of work

468
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:09,645
if I would go with this approach where I can just set up

469
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:10,826
everything in the back end.

470
00:26:10,826 --> 00:26:14,908
But yeah, we sometimes do small changes.

471
00:26:14,908 --> 00:26:17,970
For example, we try to really make the forum look

472
00:26:17,970 --> 00:26:19,491
like part of our website.

473
00:26:19,491 --> 00:26:23,053
And then we had to have the website header programmed

474
00:26:23,053 --> 00:26:25,974
into it, and then we had to tweak some things there.

475
00:26:25,974 --> 00:26:26,154
Yes.

476
00:26:30,950 --> 00:26:32,671
Thanks.

477
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:38,294
So if I have some extra time,

478
00:26:38,294 --> 00:26:41,617
I can talk a bit more about community building.

479
00:26:41,617 --> 00:26:45,059
That's a thing I really like to do.

480
00:26:46,231 --> 00:26:50,573
One thing that I really enjoyed is building up developer communities.

481
00:26:50,573 --> 00:26:55,456
I think that a lot of developers are still seeing each other more as competition

482
00:26:55,456 --> 00:26:59,218
than actually as beneficial relations.

483
00:26:59,218 --> 00:27:04,741
And for our first game, we built up basically a community around people

484
00:27:04,741 --> 00:27:07,443
who make games about nature.

485
00:27:07,443 --> 00:27:12,385
So we have a shared website with 30 games that are all related to nature

486
00:27:12,385 --> 00:27:14,326
and a shared chat.

487
00:27:14,867 --> 00:27:18,210
And it was really great, like, cross-promoting each other with that.

488
00:27:18,210 --> 00:27:25,879
And I would love to see more developer communities, like, resolving around a specific topic.

489
00:27:25,879 --> 00:27:31,945
So I would love to see, like, a space developer community and, like, if people like space games,

490
00:27:31,945 --> 00:27:34,948
they just have to go to that website and then they see, like...

491
00:27:35,349 --> 00:27:41,690
50 different games and then you can sort them by genre or whatever thing you think is important

492
00:27:41,690 --> 00:27:44,731
or is it single player or multiplayer like as a

493
00:27:44,731 --> 00:27:51,853
discoverability benefit for developers. So if you haven't considered that, please do and

494
00:27:51,853 --> 00:27:57,474
I think we are done. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me at any time and

495
00:27:57,474 --> 00:28:03,216
please fill out the survey that you will receive a mail of in a couple minutes. Thank you!

496
00:28:10,403 --> 00:28:11,044
Oh yeah, sure.

497
00:28:11,044 --> 00:28:13,404
Go right ahead.

498
00:28:13,404 --> 00:28:13,624
Sorry.

499
00:28:13,624 --> 00:28:17,826
Let's say you have a decently sized community.

500
00:28:17,826 --> 00:28:20,347
How do you keep it, how do you kind of keep all those

501
00:28:20,347 --> 00:28:23,448
members engaged kind of constantly when it seems to

502
00:28:23,448 --> 00:28:25,688
maybe be dying down a little bit?

503
00:28:26,414 --> 00:28:29,916
So for us, the most important thing to keep people engaged,

504
00:28:29,916 --> 00:28:33,940
even if we are not pushing updates very often,

505
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:36,722
is just the fact that they can discuss what

506
00:28:36,722 --> 00:28:37,763
should be in the next update.

507
00:28:37,763 --> 00:28:39,964
I mean, for the first game, we only

508
00:28:39,964 --> 00:28:42,406
release a new update every six months.

509
00:28:42,406 --> 00:28:45,389
But in between, they are very busy chatting with each other.

510
00:28:46,650 --> 00:28:51,176
So the devs only have this much time, so we really need to come up with small suggestions

511
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:54,881
that would be really great, and they spend a lot of time doing that.

512
00:28:54,881 --> 00:29:00,027
And also, if they can talk about anything else than your game, then you don't really

513
00:29:00,027 --> 00:29:03,372
need to come up with new content all the time.

514
00:29:03,372 --> 00:29:03,872
Thank you.

515
00:29:03,872 --> 00:29:04,253
You're welcome.
