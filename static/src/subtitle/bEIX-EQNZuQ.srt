1
00:00:08,555 --> 00:00:11,076
So, hello everyone. My name is Eric Pangilinan.

2
00:00:11,496 --> 00:00:13,297
And I'm Christian Nakata. Hi everybody.

3
00:00:13,977 --> 00:00:18,299
And we're here to talk about our experience with making cinematic environments for Uncharted 4.

4
00:00:19,339 --> 00:00:23,501
First we'll share some basic principles that we use when we design these environments.

5
00:00:23,801 --> 00:00:29,063
Then we'll talk about how cinematics were made back in the last generation and how it compares to how it's done now.

6
00:00:29,991 --> 00:00:34,695
Then we'll go over a general workflow of what we use at Naughty Dog to create these environments

7
00:00:34,815 --> 00:00:37,017
based on an environment artist's perspective.

8
00:00:38,459 --> 00:00:42,783
Christian will show two case studies on two related environments, one in the beginning

9
00:00:43,824 --> 00:00:45,285
and the other one in the end of the game.

10
00:00:45,765 --> 00:00:49,909
Hopefully by the end of this presentation, you can see how we apply these principles

11
00:00:49,949 --> 00:00:51,991
to our environment to help tell a better story.

12
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,223
In a cinematic, the environment is one of the components that can tell the story.

13
00:01:00,743 --> 00:01:02,164
The other component is the character.

14
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:07,728
The character usually gets most of the focus, gets most of the screen time,

15
00:01:07,748 --> 00:01:11,250
the most polygons, the finest shaders, and the best lighting.

16
00:01:12,271 --> 00:01:14,473
While the environment, it usually takes a back seat.

17
00:01:16,014 --> 00:01:19,556
Like in this slide, the environment is all blurred out and completely in shadow.

18
00:01:19,796 --> 00:01:22,858
But that doesn't mean it's not important, nor is it an afterthought.

19
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,331
A lot of things need to be considered when making cinematic environments.

20
00:01:29,413 --> 00:01:33,435
When we try to tell a visual story, the environment and characters go hand in hand.

21
00:01:33,775 --> 00:01:37,276
It's all a matter of composition, lighting, camera angles, and motion.

22
00:01:38,017 --> 00:01:41,939
Like the character, but without dialogue, the environment can tell a lot of stories.

23
00:01:42,359 --> 00:01:44,820
It can tell layers of stories in a single shot.

24
00:01:46,061 --> 00:01:48,422
Far more efficient than explaining it in dialogue.

25
00:01:50,765 --> 00:01:55,546
So it's a very important medium, and we need to understand and use it effectively.

26
00:01:56,146 --> 00:02:01,767
Every prop, graphic design, every polygon and texture that you make has to have a meaning

27
00:02:02,388 --> 00:02:05,048
or a function in the screen to help push the story forward.

28
00:02:07,629 --> 00:02:10,789
Let's examine some of the cinematics we made for Uncharted 4.

29
00:02:10,829 --> 00:02:15,650
In this scene, Nate just got caught red-handed lying to Elena.

30
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:19,811
He told her that he was out in a salvaging job in Malaysia.

31
00:02:21,242 --> 00:02:25,547
But instead, she finds him in a dingy motel in Madagascar,

32
00:02:25,607 --> 00:02:27,950
planning a dangerous treasure hunt with Sully

33
00:02:28,351 --> 00:02:29,412
and a man she never met.

34
00:02:31,134 --> 00:02:32,436
She is really pissed off.

35
00:02:33,037 --> 00:02:35,940
Drake and his gang are in an awkward position,

36
00:02:36,381 --> 00:02:38,223
and Drake is trying to talk his way out of it.

37
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:44,144
The camera swings back and forth between the emotional exchange of Elaine and Drake.

38
00:02:44,484 --> 00:02:46,866
We want to show the contrast between these two shots.

39
00:02:47,426 --> 00:02:50,589
We want to show who's getting his ass kicked and who's doing the ass kicking.

40
00:02:51,269 --> 00:02:55,713
So there's dialogue here and there's body language, but through the environment you

41
00:02:55,733 --> 00:02:58,375
can help this out by enhancing the meaning of the scene.

42
00:03:01,421 --> 00:03:06,886
Where you put the characters in this space can affect the way you perceive their emotional state in the story.

43
00:03:07,727 --> 00:03:10,890
Here we see Elena being closer to the wall, showing more stability,

44
00:03:11,211 --> 00:03:15,675
Drake further from the wall, and further from his companion, showing separation and distance.

45
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:20,760
Their stability, this stability reinforces Elena's dominant position

46
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,303
and makes Drake's position feel alone and unsupported.

47
00:03:24,063 --> 00:03:25,265
So this is just spacing.

48
00:03:26,655 --> 00:03:28,196
Shapes and lines are powerful tools

49
00:03:28,256 --> 00:03:29,616
that can enhance the shot too.

50
00:03:30,216 --> 00:03:32,237
Notice behind Elena, there's a lot of straight

51
00:03:32,277 --> 00:03:34,117
and angular lines, the maps on the wall,

52
00:03:34,437 --> 00:03:38,498
the map on the table, the sharp edges on the picture frame.

53
00:03:39,038 --> 00:03:43,639
Straight lines are usually meant to relate to direct,

54
00:03:43,839 --> 00:03:46,020
being direct, aggressive, and strong.

55
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,620
Curvy lines usually mean soft, passive, and organic.

56
00:03:50,020 --> 00:03:52,521
And behind Drake, you'll see round baskets in the wall.

57
00:03:56,285 --> 00:03:59,727
We continue this theme as the scene plays up

58
00:03:59,828 --> 00:04:00,648
all the way in the end.

59
00:04:00,848 --> 00:04:04,611
Elena closer to the wall, bold straight lines in the back,

60
00:04:04,952 --> 00:04:07,554
and Drake is contrasted with a deep background

61
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:08,734
with rounder shapes.

62
00:04:10,496 --> 00:04:12,477
Not only is it interesting and dynamic

63
00:04:12,618 --> 00:04:14,499
to contrast the two opposing shots,

64
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:17,041
but the shapes and lines will add to the intensity

65
00:04:17,601 --> 00:04:18,962
or the passivity of the mood.

66
00:04:21,384 --> 00:04:23,946
So why are there square shapes behind Sam?

67
00:04:25,630 --> 00:04:27,731
These two supporting characters, Sam and Sully,

68
00:04:27,791 --> 00:04:30,212
are symbolical of the conflict within Nate.

69
00:04:31,012 --> 00:04:33,033
Sam represents the selfish side of Drake,

70
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:34,794
the side that misses adventure

71
00:04:34,834 --> 00:04:36,614
and adrenaline of treasure hunting,

72
00:04:37,435 --> 00:04:39,375
and Sully represents Drake's conscience,

73
00:04:40,036 --> 00:04:42,517
the side that makes him stay with Elena and give up danger.

74
00:04:44,377 --> 00:04:45,978
But like how we use lines and shape

75
00:04:46,338 --> 00:04:47,859
on the previous slide to show mood,

76
00:04:48,619 --> 00:04:50,920
we want to use that here to show the contrast

77
00:04:50,980 --> 00:04:52,140
between these two characters.

78
00:04:54,638 --> 00:05:00,740
Like Sully, for example, we frame round basket shapes behind him to really emphasize his

79
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,020
mood.

80
00:05:01,681 --> 00:05:05,022
Sully is like a father figure to Nate and should know better to advise him.

81
00:05:05,722 --> 00:05:11,123
He also knows Elena very well, so he's in a very embarrassing situation for his involvement.

82
00:05:11,784 --> 00:05:17,825
Again, with a bit of dialogue, combined with Sully's expression and body language, a focused

83
00:05:17,845 --> 00:05:21,847
camera, the round shapes help soften the scene, the audience get the message.

84
00:05:24,615 --> 00:05:28,398
Another thing we want to point out is how we use lines and shape to show the relational

85
00:05:28,438 --> 00:05:29,559
groupings of the characters.

86
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:31,921
We add an inset in the wall.

87
00:05:32,301 --> 00:05:36,464
At first we did this to break up the space and push it further to accentuate the feeling

88
00:05:36,504 --> 00:05:36,845
of depth.

89
00:05:37,545 --> 00:05:42,049
But in this framing, the inset conveniently groups Sully and Nate together, representing

90
00:05:42,089 --> 00:05:43,770
their closeness and affinity together.

91
00:05:45,352 --> 00:05:49,955
But the framing in the inset also pushes Sam outside.

92
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:54,879
And the cabinet door is used as a frame to separate Sam

93
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:57,061
to represent that he's an outsider in the group.

94
00:05:57,861 --> 00:05:59,403
And a different shape represents him

95
00:05:59,583 --> 00:06:01,805
as having different motives and goals than the rest.

96
00:06:02,185 --> 00:06:03,386
So within this one picture,

97
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,008
using the visual tools of simple lines and shape,

98
00:06:06,388 --> 00:06:07,990
you can tell an unspoken story

99
00:06:09,371 --> 00:06:10,532
of Drake's personal struggle

100
00:06:10,592 --> 00:06:12,093
between his conscience and desires.

101
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:19,800
So here's another scene.

102
00:06:21,365 --> 00:06:27,129
Sam rescues Nate from the orphanage, and they both barely escape the mansion.

103
00:06:27,829 --> 00:06:29,550
Another very emotional night for Nate.

104
00:06:29,850 --> 00:06:33,892
Eventually they ride down to the docks, and Nate is feeling sad and confused.

105
00:06:34,413 --> 00:06:37,875
But Sam feels very confident and very optimistic for their future.

106
00:06:39,382 --> 00:06:44,165
Here we want to contrast the two spaces, the docks where Nate and Sam are standing, and

107
00:06:44,205 --> 00:06:45,505
the bright city skyline.

108
00:06:46,166 --> 00:06:51,429
Symbolically, we want to make the skyline represent their dreams, and the docks represent

109
00:06:51,569 --> 00:06:54,191
their abandoned situation, since they are orphans.

110
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:58,113
To emphasize this division,

111
00:06:59,473 --> 00:07:03,476
We used the moonlight to light the docks and make it look more desolate, abandoned, and

112
00:07:03,516 --> 00:07:03,797
cold.

113
00:07:04,457 --> 00:07:08,820
Then used the warmer city lights to make the skylight look more lively, bright, and warm.

114
00:07:09,581 --> 00:07:12,123
We used shape to contrast the skyline and the docks.

115
00:07:12,303 --> 00:07:16,486
The skyline has a lot of vertical and horizontal lines representing stability.

116
00:07:17,046 --> 00:07:22,210
And when you turn around, you'll see the docks is more made up of slanted roofs and awnings

117
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:26,813
that create more angular shapes and shadows and deeper insets.

118
00:07:28,873 --> 00:07:31,854
In the beginning of the scene, Nate is still disturbed about what happened.

119
00:07:31,974 --> 00:07:34,655
He's not sure about a lot of things, including his brother Sam.

120
00:07:35,216 --> 00:07:37,817
Again, we want to show the separation between the two brothers.

121
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:39,518
It's like the previous example.

122
00:07:39,558 --> 00:07:41,338
We want to use lines to divide the scene.

123
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:47,021
So in this picture, the bridge is the element that divides the space.

124
00:07:47,601 --> 00:07:49,882
We use a lot of vertical lines in the scene.

125
00:07:50,042 --> 00:07:52,163
In this picture, the lines of the bridge support

126
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:54,924
are used as a barrier between them.

127
00:07:55,545 --> 00:07:57,586
They act like barrier between the brothers.

128
00:07:58,413 --> 00:07:59,474
in other shots as well.

129
00:08:03,195 --> 00:08:05,977
For example, the pillars behind Sam represent those barriers.

130
00:08:06,037 --> 00:08:08,878
And as you will see Sam trying to walk towards Nate's,

131
00:08:09,238 --> 00:08:10,238
trying to convince him.

132
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:12,179
Each time Sam walks towards Nate's,

133
00:08:12,259 --> 00:08:13,660
he's breaking through those barriers.

134
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,201
In the final shot, Nate is convinced

135
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:17,801
and Sam offers him his hand.

136
00:08:19,382 --> 00:08:21,883
Using lines to contrast values can help represent

137
00:08:21,943 --> 00:08:24,044
two characters that are having opposing goals,

138
00:08:24,404 --> 00:08:25,525
mood and personalities.

139
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:30,031
Lines and shape and scale all help direct the eye

140
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,252
to create a flow in the composition.

141
00:08:32,672 --> 00:08:34,453
Earlier, Nate and Sam starts out

142
00:08:34,693 --> 00:08:36,693
on the left side of the screen together.

143
00:08:37,473 --> 00:08:39,834
Because Nate was bothered by what happened

144
00:08:39,894 --> 00:08:42,235
and didn't share Sam's excitement,

145
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,436
he wanted to show, we want to show a divide

146
00:08:44,496 --> 00:08:45,416
between these two brothers.

147
00:08:46,976 --> 00:08:49,237
To do this, we had Nate walk away

148
00:08:49,337 --> 00:08:50,818
from the frame he shared with Sam

149
00:08:51,918 --> 00:08:53,499
and walked to the right side of the screen

150
00:08:53,919 --> 00:08:54,679
in his own space.

151
00:08:55,495 --> 00:08:58,218
We use motion to use your eye to track Nate

152
00:08:58,298 --> 00:08:59,639
to the opposite side of the screen.

153
00:09:00,980 --> 00:09:04,062
We use several lines in the screen

154
00:09:04,102 --> 00:09:05,524
to direct your eye to Nate as well.

155
00:09:07,205 --> 00:09:08,566
Most obvious lines are the ones

156
00:09:08,606 --> 00:09:09,587
that are formed by the bridge.

157
00:09:10,187 --> 00:09:12,049
Perspective will attract your eye

158
00:09:12,229 --> 00:09:13,370
towards the vanishing point.

159
00:09:14,030 --> 00:09:16,252
And other lines, like the elevated freeway

160
00:09:16,292 --> 00:09:18,734
in the shoreline, as it ramps down to Nate,

161
00:09:18,794 --> 00:09:20,836
and the other invisible one are the buildings

162
00:09:20,876 --> 00:09:22,237
that decrease in height towards Nate.

163
00:09:24,605 --> 00:09:27,748
In the previous shot, we discussed directing the audience eye.

164
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:32,934
Interestingly, the human eye can only focus on one thing at a time.

165
00:09:33,474 --> 00:09:35,236
Even if we have a wide field of view,

166
00:09:35,837 --> 00:09:38,820
we can only concentrate our attention to one area of the screen.

167
00:09:39,681 --> 00:09:41,083
This is very good for directors,

168
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:43,365
because that means you can use visual tools

169
00:09:43,405 --> 00:09:46,469
to actually control the order of what the viewer looks at.

170
00:09:47,662 --> 00:09:51,024
Similar to the last slide, movement is the first thing the viewer will notice.

171
00:09:51,565 --> 00:09:55,687
The second thing the viewer will notice is the brightness and contrast, and that's why

172
00:09:56,087 --> 00:10:01,230
Nate and Sully are lit very well and also wearing light-colored shirts, and they're

173
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,491
also nicely silhouetted.

174
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:05,753
Scale is the third thing that the viewer will notice.

175
00:10:05,833 --> 00:10:09,215
So because Nate and Sully are closer to the camera, we perceive them as bigger.

176
00:10:09,935 --> 00:10:14,298
And so we have four things working for us, movement, brightness, contrast, and scale.

177
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:18,712
This is enough to attract the eye of the viewer

178
00:10:18,772 --> 00:10:20,053
to start with Nate and Sully,

179
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:22,915
and then move on to Sam and Elena.

180
00:10:23,536 --> 00:10:25,777
And for that, we use the vanishing point

181
00:10:25,997 --> 00:10:27,098
to lead your eye to them.

182
00:10:29,219 --> 00:10:31,321
So these are just some of the principles we use

183
00:10:31,381 --> 00:10:33,282
when we construct a scene.

184
00:10:33,502 --> 00:10:35,463
There are more, but we'll have to move on,

185
00:10:35,483 --> 00:10:37,225
and we'll just call it out as we go.

186
00:10:40,282 --> 00:10:43,963
So before Uncharted 4, we pre-rendered all of our cutscenes.

187
00:10:44,503 --> 00:10:46,004
And that was a big pain in the butt.

188
00:10:48,605 --> 00:10:49,385
Why did we do it?

189
00:10:49,765 --> 00:10:50,646
What was the advantage?

190
00:10:53,387 --> 00:10:55,948
First, it didn't require a lot of programming resource.

191
00:10:56,028 --> 00:10:57,629
It just needs someone to schedule

192
00:10:57,909 --> 00:10:59,409
and keep track of all the renders.

193
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:05,021
Number two, we can max out the settings of the shadow quality,

194
00:11:05,381 --> 00:11:07,622
the number of lights, the texture resolution

195
00:11:07,642 --> 00:11:10,383
to get the best image and then capture that.

196
00:11:12,644 --> 00:11:15,505
Because we couldn't afford that in real time

197
00:11:15,565 --> 00:11:16,545
in the PlayStation 3.

198
00:11:19,366 --> 00:11:22,667
It's also easier to edit a pre-rendered image

199
00:11:22,787 --> 00:11:26,188
or a pre-rendered sequence with post effects and transitions.

200
00:11:27,929 --> 00:11:29,309
But pre-rendered pipeline had...

201
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:41,211
major drawbacks. The main thing is like pre-rendered pipeline, the transitions are not seamless.

202
00:11:41,531 --> 00:11:46,375
It's either you're going to hit a black frame or it's going to be very abrupt. Also the

203
00:11:46,415 --> 00:11:53,700
quality between the two scenes are not going to be the same visual quality because one will

204
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:56,322
have the highest settings and others will have the lowest.

205
00:11:59,027 --> 00:12:04,009
You're also going to get inconsistencies with prop acquisition.

206
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:08,910
For example, if you acquire a rifle in the game and you move into the cinematics, the

207
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:09,911
rifle won't be there.

208
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:17,193
We also had issues with procedural effects like fog and particles, water, because it

209
00:12:17,273 --> 00:12:22,094
is procedural, you can't just render a certain number of frames, you have to re-render the

210
00:12:22,134 --> 00:12:22,614
whole thing.

211
00:12:23,535 --> 00:12:25,875
But the biggest drawback with pre-rendered...

212
00:12:26,632 --> 00:12:28,654
pipeline is that you have to render it.

213
00:12:29,755 --> 00:12:34,759
And we have a lot of cut scenes and there would be a lot of backlog in the render farm.

214
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:40,083
Any mistake, change, update, you had to re-render the whole thing again.

215
00:12:40,103 --> 00:12:50,691
And before you saw an update, it could actually take days because iteration time was also

216
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:51,392
a big problem.

217
00:12:52,496 --> 00:12:58,079
In U4, we did two hours and 45 minutes of cinematic animation, which is about 112 cut

218
00:12:58,139 --> 00:12:59,180
scenes.

219
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:03,263
That could have been a lot of renders to manage.

220
00:13:05,844 --> 00:13:11,067
So that's why some people at Naughty Dog think that switching to a real-time pipeline was

221
00:13:11,107 --> 00:13:14,589
the biggest technological and workflow advancement in Uncharted 4.

222
00:13:16,795 --> 00:13:19,503
Because you only have to worry about memory, frame rate,

223
00:13:19,543 --> 00:13:20,405
and random crashes.

224
00:13:20,485 --> 00:13:23,253
So you basically treat it as if it's a regular level.

225
00:13:27,453 --> 00:13:28,694
So let's get into the workflow.

226
00:13:29,194 --> 00:13:31,556
Making a cinematic environment is pretty similar

227
00:13:31,596 --> 00:13:33,797
to making a regular in-game environment.

228
00:13:34,218 --> 00:13:35,939
But obviously in the in-game environment,

229
00:13:36,019 --> 00:13:38,561
you'll be motivated, it is motivated by the gameplay.

230
00:13:39,061 --> 00:13:40,422
Plus in the in-game camera,

231
00:13:40,722 --> 00:13:42,604
we'll mostly be behind the character

232
00:13:42,944 --> 00:13:44,325
and some other limited view.

233
00:13:44,725 --> 00:13:47,547
The cinematic camera can do anything.

234
00:13:47,928 --> 00:13:49,609
So the environment only needs to look good

235
00:13:49,769 --> 00:13:51,010
where the camera's looking at it.

236
00:13:52,511 --> 00:13:53,952
But for the most part, they're all the same.

237
00:13:55,648 --> 00:13:58,529
So the first thing we do when we get a cinematic assignment

238
00:13:58,789 --> 00:14:00,229
is to meet up with the creative director

239
00:14:00,349 --> 00:14:02,570
to get an update on the story and backstory.

240
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:05,751
He gives us a general direction and insights about the scene

241
00:14:06,031 --> 00:14:07,892
and it's our job to pitch him something good.

242
00:14:08,752 --> 00:14:12,033
We do this mostly with concept art or storyboards.

243
00:14:12,493 --> 00:14:14,334
Sometimes we help out the concept artist

244
00:14:14,374 --> 00:14:16,415
by providing him with a block mesh or gray box.

245
00:14:16,855 --> 00:14:18,235
The block mesh is already vetted

246
00:14:19,016 --> 00:14:20,576
to follow the guidelines of the scene

247
00:14:20,616 --> 00:14:22,057
so it's pretty close to what we want.

248
00:14:24,484 --> 00:14:25,905
The block mesh is very rough.

249
00:14:26,725 --> 00:14:29,326
It represents the space you're building,

250
00:14:29,746 --> 00:14:32,167
and it's useful for first pass shape and size study.

251
00:14:32,567 --> 00:14:34,888
It also helps us discuss with the director

252
00:14:35,248 --> 00:14:37,089
what are the important spaces in the scene.

253
00:14:37,549 --> 00:14:39,730
It also gives us a good idea of the assets

254
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,951
and building blocks we need for production.

255
00:14:42,833 --> 00:14:45,335
we send this block mesh to the animation department

256
00:14:45,896 --> 00:14:47,977
and use it as a guide for their mocap sessions.

257
00:14:48,338 --> 00:14:50,599
A lot of things can change during the mocap session,

258
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:52,801
and most of the time, they never use the set,

259
00:14:53,462 --> 00:14:55,603
so it's always good idea to not invest

260
00:14:55,643 --> 00:14:57,044
a lot of time figuring this out.

261
00:14:57,985 --> 00:15:01,388
Or you can build modularly so you can change things quickly.

262
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:05,223
When the animation comes back, we plug it into the scene.

263
00:15:05,383 --> 00:15:07,545
The next step is to create a previs camera

264
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,267
so we can see what's going on.

265
00:15:09,727 --> 00:15:11,549
We also do a depth of field pass,

266
00:15:11,769 --> 00:15:14,571
so we also know what are the things that are blurred.

267
00:15:16,213 --> 00:15:18,695
The lead cinematic animator then pitches a camera pass

268
00:15:18,735 --> 00:15:20,797
to the director for the entire scene.

269
00:15:20,997 --> 00:15:23,119
When this gets approved, we can now watch

270
00:15:23,299 --> 00:15:26,221
and determine what are the scenes we actually see.

271
00:15:28,899 --> 00:15:30,580
Then we do another passive concept,

272
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,422
and we do this for an advanced block mesh

273
00:15:33,462 --> 00:15:35,983
that have more context to the camera angle.

274
00:15:36,383 --> 00:15:38,765
We apply the visual principles of composition

275
00:15:38,825 --> 00:15:40,846
we discussed earlier to the block mesh,

276
00:15:41,526 --> 00:15:42,907
using the shapes and the lines,

277
00:15:43,067 --> 00:15:44,768
leading the eye, dividing the space,

278
00:15:44,948 --> 00:15:46,369
applying contrast and affinity

279
00:15:46,409 --> 00:15:47,770
throughout the layout and space.

280
00:15:48,570 --> 00:15:49,831
But this is the point where you can do

281
00:15:49,871 --> 00:15:51,272
your visual problem solving

282
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:53,493
and work stuff out with the lead camera guy

283
00:15:53,533 --> 00:15:55,274
so you can help compose the better shot.

284
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,869
Since we know the camera angles,

285
00:15:59,089 --> 00:16:00,409
we can start doing some lighting.

286
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:04,291
So we give some general direction to the lighting guys,

287
00:16:04,811 --> 00:16:08,192
either in color scripts or reference pictures or movies,

288
00:16:09,052 --> 00:16:10,753
and we start out with a generic sky,

289
00:16:12,113 --> 00:16:13,513
and then later on we replace it

290
00:16:13,553 --> 00:16:15,294
with something more custom to the scene.

291
00:16:17,295 --> 00:16:18,455
After the initial lighting pass,

292
00:16:18,475 --> 00:16:19,795
we sometimes do a lighting key

293
00:16:19,895 --> 00:16:21,536
and fine tune the lighting for the characters.

294
00:16:22,365 --> 00:16:26,867
At Naughty Dog, we have a cinematic lighting team

295
00:16:27,267 --> 00:16:29,128
that's separate from the in-game lighting team.

296
00:16:29,228 --> 00:16:33,390
So you'll have to watch out for lighting transitions

297
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:35,271
and make sure that it matches between the two.

298
00:16:37,372 --> 00:16:40,573
Because our cinematic schedule is also different

299
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:41,674
from the gameplay schedule,

300
00:16:42,034 --> 00:16:43,474
we might decide on lighting setup

301
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:45,555
for the gameplay first or vice versa,

302
00:16:45,595 --> 00:16:46,996
and it might not work out for the other.

303
00:16:49,119 --> 00:16:55,567
Even before the advanced block mesh stage, the initial block mesh will still be enough

304
00:16:55,627 --> 00:17:00,853
context to start creating asset lists and props for building blocks.

305
00:17:02,295 --> 00:17:04,597
Since the production of this props can take a while,

306
00:17:04,677 --> 00:17:06,399
it's smart to start with the list early

307
00:17:06,659 --> 00:17:08,702
and send them out for outsourcing for production.

308
00:17:09,322 --> 00:17:10,824
Prop selection is very involved

309
00:17:10,864 --> 00:17:12,506
and it takes a lot of time to get it right.

310
00:17:13,026 --> 00:17:14,508
And you can't just put anything there.

311
00:17:14,848 --> 00:17:16,790
Everything has to be in contact with the scene,

312
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,132
the story, and the character.

313
00:17:18,612 --> 00:17:21,375
It has to be functional as well as aesthetically pleasing.

314
00:17:24,023 --> 00:17:27,666
Then about a month or two, we continue integrating assets from outsourcing.

315
00:17:28,007 --> 00:17:32,190
Some of these props end up going to the technical team and they make physics objects out of

316
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:37,094
them like the bumpables and moving electrical wires, banners, flapping, all that kind of

317
00:17:37,114 --> 00:17:37,354
stuff.

318
00:17:38,555 --> 00:17:42,558
The sound and special effects like rain, fog, lens flare also comes in at this point.

319
00:17:43,119 --> 00:17:46,101
And we do weekly reviews to polish and optimize until it's done.

320
00:17:47,122 --> 00:17:47,462
There you go.

321
00:17:48,847 --> 00:17:50,267
So I'm gonna pass this on to Christian,

322
00:17:50,487 --> 00:17:51,928
and this is the part of the talk

323
00:17:51,948 --> 00:17:53,428
we're gonna highlight those two environments

324
00:17:53,468 --> 00:17:54,108
that are involved.

325
00:17:54,629 --> 00:17:56,369
And what's basically the difference

326
00:17:56,429 --> 00:17:57,670
between this and other levels,

327
00:17:57,890 --> 00:17:59,370
other than nobody shooting at you,

328
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:02,051
is that all is designed to explore

329
00:18:02,251 --> 00:18:04,072
and discover the story as it unfolds

330
00:18:04,252 --> 00:18:06,273
one cinematic piece at a time to enjoy.

331
00:18:06,293 --> 00:18:12,955
Hey, so now we're gonna take a look

332
00:18:12,975 --> 00:18:14,216
at two different environments,

333
00:18:14,436 --> 00:18:16,676
the townhome and the beach house.

334
00:18:17,723 --> 00:18:21,044
In both these cases, we build an actual level with gameplay

335
00:18:21,204 --> 00:18:23,265
around a few specific cut scenes.

336
00:18:24,265 --> 00:18:26,546
Both of these levels were meant to reflect the place

337
00:18:26,586 --> 00:18:28,427
that our main character is in his life.

338
00:18:29,127 --> 00:18:31,428
And the idea is that through environmental storytelling,

339
00:18:31,508 --> 00:18:33,469
we're trying to underline the character growth

340
00:18:33,549 --> 00:18:35,070
of Nathan Drake in Uncharted.

341
00:18:36,290 --> 00:18:38,091
So at this point in the townhome,

342
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:41,152
Nate is seemingly trapped in a normal life.

343
00:18:42,012 --> 00:18:43,733
He works a basic job to earn a living,

344
00:18:43,873 --> 00:18:45,454
he isn't rich, but he's doing okay.

345
00:18:46,265 --> 00:18:48,185
So by the time we reach the beach house scene,

346
00:18:48,265 --> 00:18:51,186
we want to emphasize how much his life has changed

347
00:18:51,306 --> 00:18:53,907
and become much more of what he and Elena want.

348
00:18:55,187 --> 00:18:57,288
So it's easy to point out that one takes place

349
00:18:57,568 --> 00:18:59,228
in an older suburb of New Orleans

350
00:18:59,368 --> 00:19:01,969
and one takes place on a dream house on the beach.

351
00:19:02,869 --> 00:19:05,350
The contrast alone should show enough of a difference.

352
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:05,890
Job done.

353
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:09,331
But we found that there was so much more to tell

354
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:11,712
to try and bring a degree of believability

355
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:12,912
to each scenario.

356
00:19:14,245 --> 00:19:17,406
Aside from the animation and lighting, from an art standpoint,

357
00:19:17,786 --> 00:19:21,707
to fully tell the story here involved a purposeful use of color,

358
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:25,167
graphic design, specific environment storytelling,

359
00:19:25,647 --> 00:19:27,848
and a bit of chaos to make a plausible space.

360
00:19:32,069 --> 00:19:35,549
So on the townhome again, this was a very cutscene-driven environment,

361
00:19:35,989 --> 00:19:38,190
meaning one or two cinematic shots

362
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:41,350
inform the majority of the look and feel of the entire level.

363
00:19:42,250 --> 00:19:47,152
It turns out to be the cinematic that involves Nate and Elena having conversation over dinner

364
00:19:47,252 --> 00:19:49,753
that's the one that drove most of this one.

365
00:19:51,153 --> 00:19:55,075
So when we started Townhome, we began with a block out of this very specific scene.

366
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:58,997
Now ultimately, that layout turned out to be one of the greater challenges here,

367
00:19:59,197 --> 00:20:02,778
as we needed a space that would work for the immediate story beats,

368
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:05,960
but eventually would work for the rest of the level as well.

369
00:20:07,708 --> 00:20:10,690
Basically it means we were locked into certain architectural

370
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:12,711
and interior design choices early,

371
00:20:13,312 --> 00:20:15,714
as that had to be applied to the rest of the home afterwards.

372
00:20:16,634 --> 00:20:19,376
So with each room having somewhat specific story beats

373
00:20:19,416 --> 00:20:21,117
of their own, this was a bit tough at times.

374
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:24,440
Eventually, after multiple iterations,

375
00:20:25,420 --> 00:20:28,803
the final outside interior and exterior of the home

376
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:31,225
did not really line up at all anymore.

377
00:20:32,225 --> 00:20:35,368
But, you know, since you never actually leave the space

378
00:20:35,428 --> 00:20:37,349
and go outside, this wasn't a huge problem.

379
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:44,944
So working on the townhome actually turned out to be quite organic.

380
00:20:45,365 --> 00:20:48,047
And we got through the complete block out of the interior

381
00:20:48,107 --> 00:20:51,309
before we started considering what the outside of the space should be like.

382
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:55,892
And again, I mentioned earlier that this was meant to be an older neighborhood in New Orleans.

383
00:20:57,013 --> 00:21:01,676
So we ended up spending a good deal of time looking for reference using Google Street Maps, actually,

384
00:21:02,277 --> 00:21:04,859
to help us identify a likely candidate that we could draw from.

385
00:21:04,879 --> 00:21:07,741
It's a lot like scouting a film location, basically.

386
00:21:08,722 --> 00:21:11,103
So we blocked out the entire neighborhood in the beginning,

387
00:21:11,783 --> 00:21:14,645
but we only finalized the things that you could actually see

388
00:21:14,705 --> 00:21:16,306
from any one window in the home.

389
00:21:17,306 --> 00:21:18,787
You might be pretty surprised actually

390
00:21:18,827 --> 00:21:21,829
at the slice of life that you can get from Google Maps.

391
00:21:22,504 --> 00:21:24,164
We used some of that to our advantage

392
00:21:24,224 --> 00:21:26,245
in adding a bit of environment storytelling

393
00:21:26,285 --> 00:21:28,565
to show what kind of lives the Drake's neighbors were living.

394
00:21:29,445 --> 00:21:32,186
So backyard tools, play sets,

395
00:21:32,246 --> 00:21:34,226
a towel hanging from the balcony.

396
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:37,287
The idea was to give the player just enough information

397
00:21:37,887 --> 00:21:39,667
so that they could start to imagine

398
00:21:40,207 --> 00:21:42,508
what Nate's townhome looked like from the outside.

399
00:21:46,488 --> 00:21:50,249
So now, this is our first interior environment

400
00:21:50,269 --> 00:21:50,869
we're looking at.

401
00:21:51,704 --> 00:21:53,946
And in creating a scene like this, Elena's office,

402
00:21:54,287 --> 00:21:56,989
specific environment storytelling is factoring in a lot.

403
00:21:57,670 --> 00:22:00,553
And I'm showing a little bit of an iterative

404
00:22:00,593 --> 00:22:02,435
block mesh process that I'm gonna end up

405
00:22:02,475 --> 00:22:03,736
talking about a little bit later on.

406
00:22:04,857 --> 00:22:07,820
But the idea here was that we would take a basic

407
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:11,363
block mesh and then take it to a next level

408
00:22:11,423 --> 00:22:13,966
before we actually started to execute much of the final art.

409
00:22:15,061 --> 00:22:18,922
This kind of helped us manage a lot of the details that went into the environment storytelling.

410
00:22:19,782 --> 00:22:25,163
So back to those details, what we're trying to establish more here is who Elena is.

411
00:22:25,823 --> 00:22:27,364
Her work is pretty important to her.

412
00:22:28,204 --> 00:22:31,705
So showing things like her sticky notes for current work assignments,

413
00:22:32,165 --> 00:22:36,126
awards, education background, travel books,

414
00:22:36,146 --> 00:22:38,966
and even a penchant for collecting antique cameras,

415
00:22:39,086 --> 00:22:41,987
this all adds up to a lot of detail.

416
00:22:43,065 --> 00:22:44,826
And one of the advantages of an area like this

417
00:22:44,926 --> 00:22:47,847
is we were able to add all that geometry and texture

418
00:22:48,008 --> 00:22:50,389
since the space was pretty small.

419
00:22:51,489 --> 00:22:53,490
The main thing working against us here though

420
00:22:53,570 --> 00:22:56,151
is really just the time you need to create all of it

421
00:22:56,211 --> 00:22:57,292
and assemble it together.

422
00:22:58,492 --> 00:23:00,613
And we had a lot of people in-house working

423
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:02,454
on the graphics alone here,

424
00:23:02,954 --> 00:23:04,835
involving at least the concept department,

425
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:05,816
some of the marketing team,

426
00:23:05,836 --> 00:23:07,276
of course the background team too.

427
00:23:08,257 --> 00:23:09,237
At one point in production,

428
00:23:09,257 --> 00:23:10,898
we even hired a graphic designer

429
00:23:10,938 --> 00:23:12,178
to help with some of the workload.

430
00:23:16,866 --> 00:23:19,267
So here now we're looking at the master bedroom.

431
00:23:19,387 --> 00:23:22,689
And what I find interesting in this area

432
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:25,010
was this is where we really start to get into questions

433
00:23:25,070 --> 00:23:28,431
about what makes a living space believable.

434
00:23:29,812 --> 00:23:32,053
So early on, of course, we looked at a lot

435
00:23:32,093 --> 00:23:34,054
of reference material online for bedrooms.

436
00:23:34,634 --> 00:23:36,175
And it's easy to find things showing

437
00:23:36,956 --> 00:23:39,837
the latest trends in linens and et cetera.

438
00:23:40,578 --> 00:23:42,559
But one of the things we started to realize

439
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,880
was that people are really reluctant to show

440
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,360
how messy we can be in pictures online.

441
00:23:48,101 --> 00:23:50,481
It turns out people would much rather take pictures

442
00:23:50,581 --> 00:23:51,922
of their really cool stuff,

443
00:23:52,022 --> 00:23:53,802
and it's all really clean and neat and stuff.

444
00:23:55,103 --> 00:23:57,023
So, but really though, it's this clutter

445
00:23:57,083 --> 00:23:59,344
and small amount of chaos that helps a scene

446
00:23:59,384 --> 00:24:01,124
seem more like a living, breathing space.

447
00:24:01,164 --> 00:24:04,005
So, starting with a bed that's still unmade,

448
00:24:04,765 --> 00:24:07,186
what kind of lives are Nate and Elena living

449
00:24:07,486 --> 00:24:08,686
as working professionals?

450
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,703
and they probably don't have time to always make the bed.

451
00:24:12,783 --> 00:24:15,943
And clothes are scattered around here and there,

452
00:24:16,283 --> 00:24:20,044
various items cluttered on top of a bathroom sink.

453
00:24:20,324 --> 00:24:23,425
So the point really though isn't that they're dirty

454
00:24:23,505 --> 00:24:25,105
or completely disorganized,

455
00:24:25,225 --> 00:24:28,345
but that they're busy people with busy lives.

456
00:24:29,706 --> 00:24:32,786
And this was probably one of the cornerstone ideas

457
00:24:33,246 --> 00:24:35,207
when we designed this and other living spaces

458
00:24:35,247 --> 00:24:37,867
like the beach house and even Nate's office.

459
00:24:38,662 --> 00:24:41,564
And it's also one of those things that's really easy to

460
00:24:41,864 --> 00:24:43,925
overdo, as I'm going to talk about in the next slide.

461
00:24:49,468 --> 00:24:51,449
So that leads us to this space.

462
00:24:51,489 --> 00:24:52,330
This is the kitchen.

463
00:24:53,410 --> 00:24:55,491
Now, one of the areas we went a bit too far with with the

464
00:24:55,531 --> 00:24:57,913
chaos, and it definitely had to rein this back in.

465
00:24:58,553 --> 00:25:00,454
So at one point, the area was starting to look like a

466
00:25:00,534 --> 00:25:01,034
kitchen nightmare.

467
00:25:03,186 --> 00:25:06,708
At the time, it seemed more realistic that when someone cooks in the kitchen,

468
00:25:07,069 --> 00:25:08,390
they leave a mess behind.

469
00:25:08,450 --> 00:25:11,392
At least, I tend to do that anyway when I cook.

470
00:25:12,173 --> 00:25:15,835
So there really comes a point, though, when too much clutter or mess

471
00:25:16,056 --> 00:25:17,817
can become distracting.

472
00:25:18,177 --> 00:25:20,879
And here, the idea was just to make a believable space,

473
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:25,143
not how messy the kitchen can get when someone decides to prepare food.

474
00:25:26,722 --> 00:25:31,069
So we wanted the attention to stay focused on the right things about Nate and Elena,

475
00:25:31,409 --> 00:25:34,113
especially in regards to the story beats here.

476
00:25:35,676 --> 00:25:37,879
Another thing I found interesting I'm going to point out here is...

477
00:25:40,342 --> 00:25:42,442
It's just a unique opportunity we have

478
00:25:42,462 --> 00:25:44,843
for a certain type of environmental storytelling.

479
00:25:45,663 --> 00:25:47,703
So the fact that there would be another kitchen

480
00:25:47,803 --> 00:25:50,964
later in the game that we would be able to contrast with too

481
00:25:51,304 --> 00:25:53,284
led to some interesting opportunities.

482
00:25:54,025 --> 00:25:55,845
So one of which came up with the fridge.

483
00:25:56,445 --> 00:25:58,066
Not only did we come up with the idea

484
00:25:58,146 --> 00:26:00,986
for using the front of the fridge for literal storytelling

485
00:26:01,066 --> 00:26:02,486
by using sticky notes,

486
00:26:03,307 --> 00:26:05,667
but I think you can often discover a lot about someone

487
00:26:06,247 --> 00:26:07,828
from the foods that they like to eat.

488
00:26:08,710 --> 00:26:11,933
So all the items inside the fridge were designed with the idea that again,

489
00:26:12,053 --> 00:26:15,795
as busy people, Nate and Elena ate a lot of convenience foods,

490
00:26:16,155 --> 00:26:20,598
takeout boxes, prepared foods, sodas, and more snack items. Again,

491
00:26:20,658 --> 00:26:23,460
busy folks with busy lives. Later on,

492
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:27,003
this will come up when you get to go through Drake's kitchen at a much

493
00:26:27,103 --> 00:26:29,865
different stage in their growth as people.

494
00:26:33,915 --> 00:26:36,738
So, so far we've gone through a good deal of the Drake's townhome and haven't really

495
00:26:36,778 --> 00:26:39,381
talked much about the area you start out in, the attic.

496
00:26:39,561 --> 00:26:42,524
This is Nathan Drake's sanctuary, or man cave.

497
00:26:44,006 --> 00:26:49,071
So this is where we get to relive many of Nate's past adventures and real interests.

498
00:26:49,432 --> 00:26:52,134
So we had the benefit of starting with concept on this one.

499
00:26:53,444 --> 00:26:58,486
We only had the additional challenge of teasing out all the details from within that image.

500
00:26:58,666 --> 00:27:02,047
Like the Malaysia job, for instance, that you start off the scene with,

501
00:27:02,707 --> 00:27:09,610
that actually had real maps, notes, and images that were all created from real historical research

502
00:27:09,710 --> 00:27:11,811
and had an actual mini-story to it.

503
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:20,751
Speaking of details, we got a pretty good idea of what that composition looks like from this side of the attic,

504
00:27:20,851 --> 00:27:25,432
but what about the other side? What about all those small artifacts that we had to create?

505
00:27:26,073 --> 00:27:31,834
This was a pretty packed space with some actual gameplay, so we needed to be careful about making too many assets

506
00:27:32,494 --> 00:27:34,954
or not enough to fill the area out properly.

507
00:27:35,454 --> 00:27:40,775
So we came up with this way of working more iteratively, and I kind of talked about that a little bit earlier with Elena's office.

508
00:27:41,436 --> 00:27:42,516
So we ended up...

509
00:27:45,613 --> 00:27:52,157
After we got the concept, we moved into a basic traditional block mesh to work out both the cutscene and the gameplay.

510
00:27:52,738 --> 00:27:59,622
But then we did an additional more detailed block mesh that indicated placement, color, and composition on a much smaller scale.

511
00:28:00,383 --> 00:28:03,545
So props placed on shelves, for instance, would get this treatment.

512
00:28:03,845 --> 00:28:07,407
That way we knew as much as possible earlier on what was needed in the space,

513
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:11,110
and we tried as much as possible to only create those items.

514
00:28:12,412 --> 00:28:15,172
That gave us much more time to work on some of those items

515
00:28:15,192 --> 00:28:18,673
that people tend to take for granted, the mundane stuff,

516
00:28:18,973 --> 00:28:21,454
like, for instance, cardboard boxes.

517
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,055
Yes, cardboard boxes.

518
00:28:23,935 --> 00:28:27,056
We took the time to craft some very detailed boxes.

519
00:28:27,936 --> 00:28:30,397
We cared about why they were crumpled and where,

520
00:28:30,837 --> 00:28:32,477
and this took weeks.

521
00:28:32,697 --> 00:28:35,698
But in the end, it's funny, because at a glance,

522
00:28:35,778 --> 00:28:38,259
it's just a box, but it actually ended up

523
00:28:38,299 --> 00:28:41,700
being one of the most reused assets in the entire game.

524
00:28:45,945 --> 00:28:48,446
So fast forward to the end of the game, the beach house.

525
00:28:49,586 --> 00:28:52,167
Now we wanted to show that the Drakes were doing well

526
00:28:52,387 --> 00:28:54,267
and living the life that they always wanted.

527
00:28:54,787 --> 00:28:57,148
The character arc here is mostly complete

528
00:28:57,648 --> 00:29:00,129
and now we're just highlighting that result.

529
00:29:01,369 --> 00:29:03,429
So in stark contrast to the townhome,

530
00:29:03,509 --> 00:29:06,830
this space was meant to be more airy and vibrant.

531
00:29:07,550 --> 00:29:09,291
And we also started with a more generous

532
00:29:09,331 --> 00:29:10,531
and forgiving block mesh.

533
00:29:11,251 --> 00:29:12,932
Forgiving in the sense that the story beats

534
00:29:12,992 --> 00:29:15,652
gave us a bit more flexibility in designing the space.

535
00:29:16,698 --> 00:29:19,544
And two cutscenes help dictate the flow of the layout this time.

536
00:29:19,604 --> 00:29:23,593
This is the Cassie video game sequence and the locked armoire scene.

537
00:29:27,276 --> 00:29:30,337
In retrospect, it seemed like an easy idea to art up.

538
00:29:30,677 --> 00:29:33,578
The Drakes are successful, so sure, a beach house.

539
00:29:34,218 --> 00:29:34,918
No problem, right?

540
00:29:35,799 --> 00:29:38,479
But in reality, though, we felt that we had to justify

541
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:41,020
as much of the Drake's new lifestyle as we could

542
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:43,101
to make this seem as realistic as possible.

543
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:44,621
We had to ask ourselves,

544
00:29:45,802 --> 00:29:48,082
how would Nate and Elena choose to live?

545
00:29:48,283 --> 00:29:50,803
What kind of environment would they surround themselves in?

546
00:29:51,544 --> 00:29:56,246
So we end up sticking to the basic theme in the end of a tropical location and comfortable living.

547
00:29:56,947 --> 00:29:59,628
But from there we did a lot of research into different decor

548
00:29:59,948 --> 00:30:04,191
between Spanish colonial, craftsman, one with nature concepts,

549
00:30:04,971 --> 00:30:09,374
bohemian and of course world culture themes factored in as well.

550
00:30:13,116 --> 00:30:15,277
Early on we came up with this concept.

551
00:30:16,645 --> 00:30:19,127
that if we mixed and matched furniture styles,

552
00:30:19,227 --> 00:30:21,549
that things would just naturally seem more grounded.

553
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:23,731
So here we're looking at the family room

554
00:30:23,791 --> 00:30:26,193
and we were able to introduce a huge,

555
00:30:29,276 --> 00:30:32,498
a variety of influences into the scene with a decor.

556
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,401
The idea here was based on a concept

557
00:30:36,441 --> 00:30:39,404
that people just don't buy whole sets of furniture

558
00:30:39,464 --> 00:30:40,825
for the entire house at once.

559
00:30:42,388 --> 00:30:45,931
More often, what ends up happening is a general mix of style and color,

560
00:30:46,271 --> 00:30:49,755
as people gradually accumulate a set of furniture over time

561
00:30:49,815 --> 00:30:51,236
in accordance with their lifestyle.

562
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:55,360
So in the townhome, we saw a restrained version of that happening

563
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:58,342
based on Nate and Elena's situation at that time.

564
00:30:59,003 --> 00:31:02,927
Most of their furniture was just simple, practical, and necessary.

565
00:31:03,727 --> 00:31:05,407
But by the time we get to the cabana,

566
00:31:05,647 --> 00:31:07,728
the drakes are fully embracing the things in life

567
00:31:07,768 --> 00:31:08,648
that make them happy.

568
00:31:09,448 --> 00:31:13,030
So the mix of decor is much more colorful and expressive.

569
00:31:14,410 --> 00:31:15,671
Again, though, there was a time

570
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:17,611
when we went off the rails again.

571
00:31:17,631 --> 00:31:20,152
And this was when,

572
00:31:20,872 --> 00:31:23,693
just trying to get just that right mix of decor.

573
00:31:24,433 --> 00:31:26,994
So at one point, the idea of having a tiki bar

574
00:31:27,034 --> 00:31:28,295
seemed like it would fit right in

575
00:31:28,335 --> 00:31:30,175
with this idea of mixing in different things.

576
00:31:31,048 --> 00:31:36,433
You can almost picture Sully visiting with a Mai Tai cocktail in one hand and a cigar in the other.

577
00:31:36,453 --> 00:31:41,198
But with an exotic mix of furniture, we thought, why not?

578
00:31:41,338 --> 00:31:46,283
Of course, only after we actually ended up putting in all this effort into it

579
00:31:46,323 --> 00:31:49,005
did we realize that it had nothing to do with the character

580
00:31:49,586 --> 00:31:52,048
or the central themes of the story we were telling here.

581
00:31:52,891 --> 00:31:55,877
What was worse, it stood out and called attention to itself,

582
00:31:55,957 --> 00:32:00,706
and it made you wonder why they had this insane tiki set up in their house.

583
00:32:04,567 --> 00:32:06,649
In creating many of the spaces in the environment,

584
00:32:06,749 --> 00:32:09,751
we could really explore a lot of different looks

585
00:32:09,891 --> 00:32:11,032
for furniture and decor,

586
00:32:11,072 --> 00:32:13,254
but we couldn't have done that with as much freedom

587
00:32:13,294 --> 00:32:15,436
without a central color scheme.

588
00:32:16,156 --> 00:32:17,838
So for the most part in the cabana,

589
00:32:17,878 --> 00:32:20,500
we stuck to a very beach side color palette.

590
00:32:21,180 --> 00:32:23,802
Using the cool blue, it balanced out pretty well

591
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:25,604
with all the warm colored woods.

592
00:32:26,532 --> 00:32:28,493
The interior patterns and tile colors

593
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:29,873
were just extensions on that.

594
00:32:30,794 --> 00:32:32,074
Adding to that color scheme,

595
00:32:32,114 --> 00:32:35,015
we also pushed a lot more foliage throughout the interior.

596
00:32:35,936 --> 00:32:38,257
Keeping with this basic theme helped unite

597
00:32:38,717 --> 00:32:40,877
all the more exotic looks from room to room.

598
00:32:41,678 --> 00:32:42,998
And we did this to a certain extent

599
00:32:43,058 --> 00:32:44,319
with the townhome as well,

600
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,179
just using a much more neutral color scheme.

601
00:32:48,100 --> 00:32:49,661
Coming back again to talking about

602
00:32:50,081 --> 00:32:51,281
environmental storytelling,

603
00:32:51,301 --> 00:32:53,602
we can revisit the fridge here a little bit.

604
00:32:54,872 --> 00:32:57,173
Now we can complete the fridge character arc.

605
00:32:58,754 --> 00:33:01,976
So note Nate and Elena's current lifestyle

606
00:33:02,016 --> 00:33:03,637
and how much has changed from when they lived

607
00:33:03,677 --> 00:33:04,958
in New Orleans to now,

608
00:33:05,378 --> 00:33:07,379
not only has the outside of the fridge changed

609
00:33:07,459 --> 00:33:09,381
to a more updated and modern style,

610
00:33:09,901 --> 00:33:11,922
but we altered the details here.

611
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:15,124
Both the sticky notes and the contents of the fridge

612
00:33:15,184 --> 00:33:17,746
continue to help punctuate the changes

613
00:33:18,006 --> 00:33:19,267
in Nate and Elena's life,

614
00:33:20,367 --> 00:33:22,969
with healthier and fresher food choices.

615
00:33:27,562 --> 00:33:32,524
As mentioned earlier, Cassie's room was one of a couple of key areas in the epilogue level.

616
00:33:33,244 --> 00:33:36,705
Not only did it help inform much of the layout of the rest of the house,

617
00:33:37,426 --> 00:33:41,307
but it also set the tone for the sheer amount of detail throughout this level.

618
00:33:42,088 --> 00:33:45,589
All this detail was vital to creating Cassie's backstory.

619
00:33:46,910 --> 00:33:50,531
You only really get to this one level to get to know the latest Drake,

620
00:33:50,591 --> 00:33:54,113
so any environmental storytelling we could do here was pretty important.

621
00:33:55,312 --> 00:33:58,895
We started this with a basic idea of who she was and a few concept images.

622
00:33:59,716 --> 00:34:04,141
Going from there, we created a basic block in the room for the starting cutscene.

623
00:34:04,741 --> 00:34:07,885
And we also created a first-pass list of all of Cassie's interests,

624
00:34:08,425 --> 00:34:11,128
so we could immediately figure out how it was all going to fit

625
00:34:11,208 --> 00:34:13,310
without giving her the biggest room in the whole house.

626
00:34:17,817 --> 00:34:23,540
With that in mind, we also wanted to allow for the huge influence Cassie's family's life would have on her interests.

627
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:28,723
The creative side from Elena, Cassie's interest in art, books, music, and photography.

628
00:34:29,583 --> 00:34:32,705
And the adventurous side from Cassie's high-adrenaline father, Nate.

629
00:34:33,646 --> 00:34:40,309
So showing all of the rock climbing and surfing imagery in the posters, that all added up.

630
00:34:41,157 --> 00:34:44,638
to one cohesive personality, we hope, in the end.

631
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:46,979
This meant we needed a lot of elements

632
00:34:46,999 --> 00:34:50,461
to help make that believable in one modestly sized space.

633
00:34:51,982 --> 00:34:53,562
Now, not only did we have a large amount

634
00:34:53,602 --> 00:34:55,423
of environmental storytelling to figure out,

635
00:34:55,463 --> 00:34:58,625
but also a less restrained amount of clutter and chaos.

636
00:34:59,385 --> 00:35:00,465
Many kids you probably know

637
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:02,226
have to be told to clean up their rooms.

638
00:35:03,175 --> 00:35:06,717
Now Cassie, despite her maturity and her varied interests,

639
00:35:06,817 --> 00:35:08,818
is still a kid, so we allowed for that element

640
00:35:08,858 --> 00:35:10,980
to come through in developing her personality.

641
00:35:12,260 --> 00:35:14,641
This is where using another round of more detailed

642
00:35:14,661 --> 00:35:16,562
block mesh again came into play.

643
00:35:17,123 --> 00:35:19,584
Not only was it important for efficiency's sake,

644
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:22,065
but it also helped us figure out how we were going

645
00:35:22,085 --> 00:35:24,267
to navigate around all this stuff

646
00:35:24,407 --> 00:35:27,068
that described a character you were only going to get

647
00:35:27,128 --> 00:35:28,809
to have one chapter to know.

648
00:35:30,493 --> 00:35:36,476
So having color and even an indication of that final graphic design on that block mesh

649
00:35:36,516 --> 00:35:38,497
was also very helpful for the final result.

650
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:44,921
Color and pattern in this room probably changed four or five times before we struck on something

651
00:35:44,961 --> 00:35:45,421
that worked.

652
00:35:49,896 --> 00:35:52,577
In the second of the two primary spaces in Beach House,

653
00:35:52,877 --> 00:35:55,198
we had the family workspace.

654
00:35:55,778 --> 00:35:58,019
This was an area that was made around the cut scene

655
00:35:58,039 --> 00:36:01,040
where Cassie finds the key to her parents' locked armoire.

656
00:36:02,821 --> 00:36:04,741
The focal point here was the armoire,

657
00:36:04,801 --> 00:36:07,322
but the spacing had to allow for key points

658
00:36:07,522 --> 00:36:09,863
in the cinematic and also the bits of gameplay

659
00:36:09,923 --> 00:36:12,644
leading up to the moments between Cassie and her parents.

660
00:36:13,757 --> 00:36:17,480
So once we established the main parts of the scene in block mesh, we could go crazy from

661
00:36:17,540 --> 00:36:19,662
that point again with environmental storytelling.

662
00:36:20,403 --> 00:36:23,646
The concept shown here is one of the things we looked at when we started to set the right

663
00:36:23,686 --> 00:36:25,487
tone and mood for what we would be going for.

664
00:36:32,753 --> 00:36:35,256
So Workshed was what we ended up calling this space.

665
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:44,524
It was meant to give enough of a backstory about what Nate and Elena have been up to over the years in crafting a successful business out of their love of adventure and exploration.

666
00:36:45,285 --> 00:36:50,188
And we ended up combining the features from many different types of work studios to get the final result.

667
00:36:50,889 --> 00:37:02,116
So this is part photography studio, part printmaker studio, part study library, add in a bit of museum, antique store, warehouse, and then let's tack on a small mudroom just to keep some equipment on hand.

668
00:37:03,060 --> 00:37:08,128
that. On top of all that, it still needed to feel homey, so we used a lot of the

669
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:12,394
warm woods and red tones from the rugs along with the lighting to maintain a

670
00:37:12,455 --> 00:37:14,037
sense of comfort throughout the area.

671
00:37:18,229 --> 00:37:22,893
Again, like Cassie's room, the area required a lot of asset creation to provide environmental

672
00:37:22,913 --> 00:37:23,573
storytelling.

673
00:37:24,173 --> 00:37:28,357
This is probably one of the most exacting areas in the level with regards to specific

674
00:37:28,517 --> 00:37:29,217
storytelling.

675
00:37:29,798 --> 00:37:35,482
So most every newspaper article, map, or magazine picture had to stand on its own merits.

676
00:37:36,022 --> 00:37:40,545
We really tried to repeat things as little as possible throughout Epilogue, despite the

677
00:37:40,585 --> 00:37:42,467
large volume of detailed assets.

678
00:37:43,363 --> 00:37:46,365
The armor itself is most likely the densest area

679
00:37:46,405 --> 00:37:48,665
between both the townhome and the beach house.

680
00:37:49,486 --> 00:37:51,647
We were able to get concept help with that area

681
00:37:51,727 --> 00:37:53,907
and it still required the two stages of block mesh

682
00:37:53,927 --> 00:37:55,428
to get everything working well enough.

683
00:37:59,789 --> 00:38:01,930
Another particular challenge involving the workshed

684
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:04,351
was in creating the newspaper and magazine wall.

685
00:38:05,612 --> 00:38:06,952
Now deceptively simple,

686
00:38:07,032 --> 00:38:09,933
this wall required a block in all on its own.

687
00:38:11,095 --> 00:38:18,379
We had to get that to scale with basic color, layout, and even content to a mild extent before executing the finish.

688
00:38:19,159 --> 00:38:23,762
Again, this was to help minimize the effort that would be needed to get what we needed for this location.

689
00:38:24,462 --> 00:38:29,044
So combining this with all the images in Cassie's room between the posters, the prints, and the postcards,

690
00:38:29,665 --> 00:38:31,926
there were a lot of unique images that we had to make.

691
00:38:34,238 --> 00:38:36,600
Getting to the composite 2D images you see here

692
00:38:36,660 --> 00:38:39,221
required the assistance of many different departments.

693
00:38:39,561 --> 00:38:41,463
We were able to reuse some of the images

694
00:38:41,503 --> 00:38:44,344
from other situations, but for the most part,

695
00:38:44,404 --> 00:38:45,945
everything here had to be unique

696
00:38:45,985 --> 00:38:47,586
to just this section of the game.

697
00:38:48,607 --> 00:38:50,828
So a little bit about our process for doing that.

698
00:38:53,750 --> 00:38:56,611
So first we had to determine the amount of space we needed,

699
00:38:56,631 --> 00:38:58,692
and to do that we had to put in a basic block,

700
00:38:58,752 --> 00:39:01,114
and like I mentioned, we had a rough layout,

701
00:39:01,434 --> 00:39:03,575
and then we got some basic idea of content.

702
00:39:04,529 --> 00:39:06,890
Then we asked our animation team to do the poses

703
00:39:06,910 --> 00:39:08,850
with the characters that we needed in the photo,

704
00:39:09,190 --> 00:39:11,051
along with an occasional proper backdrop.

705
00:39:11,811 --> 00:39:13,091
Then, on to lighting.

706
00:39:13,791 --> 00:39:15,672
After that, the images got a final pass

707
00:39:15,692 --> 00:39:17,932
from the concept team if it needed more details.

708
00:39:18,513 --> 00:39:20,573
And then, we actually had one more stop

709
00:39:20,593 --> 00:39:23,214
with the graphic designer to add the final touches

710
00:39:23,254 --> 00:39:26,034
and put things together into a more polished layout

711
00:39:26,115 --> 00:39:28,235
with type and logo treatment, if necessary.

712
00:39:30,497 --> 00:39:34,422
Now occasionally we got lucky and were able to reuse a piece of concept that just fit

713
00:39:34,462 --> 00:39:39,007
the look and vibe of what we were going for, but this seemed to be really rare and didn't

714
00:39:39,047 --> 00:39:40,809
happen nearly as often as I would have liked.

715
00:39:45,215 --> 00:39:48,736
So it wasn't just enough to give the impression of what the Drakes were all about in Epilogue,

716
00:39:48,776 --> 00:39:51,537
we also literally wanted to show some of that work in action.

717
00:39:51,697 --> 00:39:55,359
So initially this was pitched as a more creative work area for Cassie.

718
00:39:56,079 --> 00:39:58,220
We had an easel set up with paintbrushes and all that.

719
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,201
But again this didn't help the story here as much as we wanted.

720
00:40:02,842 --> 00:40:07,083
So we came up with a better idea where we could show more day-to-day operations through

721
00:40:07,103 --> 00:40:08,744
an actual ongoing job.

722
00:40:10,078 --> 00:40:15,422
a bit more elaborate storytelling here to help further flesh out the adventure of work for hire story beats.

723
00:40:16,463 --> 00:40:20,505
And this had to go through several iterations, initial block in outlining the space,

724
00:40:20,986 --> 00:40:25,209
then we did a lot of refinement as we went along until we arrived at the point that you see here.

725
00:40:26,290 --> 00:40:29,052
This is one of the few areas between the townhome and the beach home

726
00:40:29,492 --> 00:40:32,634
where we use a good portion of the space to just tell one story.

727
00:40:33,609 --> 00:40:37,835
When we started the process, we thought that just using the one work table would be enough,

728
00:40:38,416 --> 00:40:42,803
but eventually it became apparent that we were going to need a lot more detail to really

729
00:40:42,923 --> 00:40:44,065
sell this concept.

730
00:40:44,986 --> 00:40:49,012
So ultimately, this seemed to need at least three times as much content as what we initially

731
00:40:49,072 --> 00:40:49,333
thought.

732
00:40:52,589 --> 00:40:58,873
The Mayan ruins job here is just one part of many elements that helped us tell the story in Cabana.

733
00:40:59,673 --> 00:41:05,236
In conclusion, a great deal of story though was told by many environmental details like this across the game.

734
00:41:06,056 --> 00:41:11,419
Successfully using those details to our best advantage all came down to how we managed them.

735
00:41:14,788 --> 00:41:18,810
So to wrap this up, I just want to bring it back to the beginning where we show the importance

736
00:41:18,850 --> 00:41:21,351
of using environment as part of the storytelling.

737
00:41:22,011 --> 00:41:26,173
Whether it's a small prop or lines on the wall, nothing should really be random.

738
00:41:26,693 --> 00:41:29,094
Everything should have a meaning and a reason to be there.

739
00:41:29,555 --> 00:41:35,377
So knowing your visual tools and principles, it'll help you communicate better and identify

740
00:41:35,497 --> 00:41:37,999
opportunities to enhance the story that you're telling.

741
00:41:38,899 --> 00:41:39,099
Thank you.

742
00:41:50,097 --> 00:41:52,058
I guess we have a little time for QA.

743
00:41:52,398 --> 00:41:52,818
Yeah.

744
00:41:52,878 --> 00:42:02,061
Oh, I think, oh, I'm sorry.

745
00:42:02,081 --> 00:42:05,261
I think you're supposed to go to the mic so that people can,

746
00:42:05,281 --> 00:42:05,542
sorry.

747
00:42:07,982 --> 00:42:08,302
No.

748
00:42:09,023 --> 00:42:10,523
You want to go first?

749
00:42:11,123 --> 00:42:11,563
You can go first.

750
00:42:12,836 --> 00:42:12,956
Hi.

751
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,479
Earlier you said that you had two separate lighting

752
00:42:16,519 --> 00:42:19,922
teams for your cut scenes and for the in-game play.

753
00:42:20,283 --> 00:42:21,604
I was wondering why it is that you'll

754
00:42:21,644 --> 00:42:24,426
have that and what the advantages and disadvantages

755
00:42:24,546 --> 00:42:25,247
are for that.

756
00:42:27,028 --> 00:42:28,790
I think that's more of a legacy setup.

757
00:42:29,110 --> 00:42:31,953
Like before, because we did pre-rendered and stuff,

758
00:42:32,653 --> 00:42:33,294
it required.

759
00:42:35,476 --> 00:42:38,898
the in-game team to be more technical and like the level differently,

760
00:42:39,178 --> 00:42:41,839
so they had to deal directly with the game.

761
00:42:42,320 --> 00:42:45,101
The cinematics are more film-oriented,

762
00:42:45,962 --> 00:42:48,203
so that's more of a legacy setup.

763
00:42:48,283 --> 00:42:50,744
We're moving towards unifying both of them

764
00:42:51,004 --> 00:42:53,345
because it's basically almost the same now.

765
00:42:53,846 --> 00:42:54,826
Okay, all right. Thank you.

766
00:42:56,527 --> 00:42:56,667
Hi.

767
00:42:57,386 --> 00:43:03,111
So, quick question. What would you say is your personal favorite examples of using an

768
00:43:03,171 --> 00:43:06,854
environment to tell a story, whether in your own games or any games you've played?

769
00:43:09,356 --> 00:43:18,564
Wow. Environment examples in our game, for example? It could be your game, a game you've

770
00:43:18,584 --> 00:43:18,884
played.

771
00:43:22,781 --> 00:43:25,683
Let's just go back to the Maya job, for example.

772
00:43:25,703 --> 00:43:35,250
I like that piece specifically because we set it up where the story actually, the environment

773
00:43:35,330 --> 00:43:39,313
actually pushed you into the story so it funnels you into the story.

774
00:43:39,834 --> 00:43:40,894
into the cabinet.

775
00:43:41,395 --> 00:43:44,597
So the reason why we changed the story

776
00:43:44,677 --> 00:43:49,980
from the Cassies workshop into an ongoing job

777
00:43:50,460 --> 00:43:53,222
was that we needed sort of piece the puzzle

778
00:43:53,762 --> 00:43:58,385
to funnel you into different parts of the cabana

779
00:43:58,425 --> 00:44:01,487
so that you end up in the cabinet.

780
00:44:04,489 --> 00:44:05,109
Thank you.

781
00:44:11,169 --> 00:44:17,012
Hi, thanks for coming today. What's some of the language like working with prop designers

782
00:44:17,412 --> 00:44:26,318
for like having a unified theme so that it fit each room mood or message?

783
00:44:28,199 --> 00:44:30,701
I'm not sure what you mean exactly.

784
00:44:32,481 --> 00:44:36,442
So you mean how do we figure out which props to use?

785
00:44:36,722 --> 00:44:39,522
Almost like being an interior designer, right?

786
00:44:39,582 --> 00:44:40,462
Right.

787
00:44:40,582 --> 00:44:42,603
A lot of it have to do with the story

788
00:44:42,743 --> 00:44:47,584
and putting yourself on the shoes of Elena or Drake

789
00:44:48,144 --> 00:44:51,965
and trying to sort of personify what they would do.

790
00:44:53,105 --> 00:44:55,805
The rest of it is just curating,

791
00:44:56,605 --> 00:44:59,006
balancing the colors and style.

792
00:45:00,584 --> 00:45:02,885
So, yeah, and that's really where the iteration,

793
00:45:03,345 --> 00:45:05,286
the iterative block mesh really kind of helps out

794
00:45:05,326 --> 00:45:07,387
because it gives you context for those things.

795
00:45:07,487 --> 00:45:09,808
So, I mean, you can kind of just create a list

796
00:45:09,828 --> 00:45:11,649
like we talked about earlier with Cassie's room.

797
00:45:11,669 --> 00:45:13,490
You just, you start thinking of things

798
00:45:13,530 --> 00:45:15,211
that might work for that personality,

799
00:45:15,251 --> 00:45:18,012
but you don't ultimately know how well

800
00:45:18,072 --> 00:45:19,173
those things are all gonna work

801
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:21,534
until you actually start putting them together.

802
00:45:22,661 --> 00:45:26,804
A lot of times you put in your personal taste in there,

803
00:45:26,864 --> 00:45:29,425
but then you're forgetting that this is not your taste,

804
00:45:29,445 --> 00:45:32,327
this is Cassie's taste or Elena's taste.

805
00:45:32,728 --> 00:45:34,188
And that's something that you always have to

806
00:45:34,949 --> 00:45:38,011
take away from yourself and consult, let's say,

807
00:45:38,111 --> 00:45:41,833
other directors to make sure that the story and the feel,

808
00:45:41,874 --> 00:45:42,954
because a lot of people,

809
00:45:42,994 --> 00:45:44,575
that's the biggest problem we ran into,

810
00:45:44,615 --> 00:45:47,557
is that everyone has an idea of who Drake and Elena is,

811
00:45:47,597 --> 00:45:49,198
what do they eat, what clothes they wear.

812
00:45:49,619 --> 00:45:53,740
So all of us have to sort of agree and argue, like, nah, she's not going to shop there,

813
00:45:53,780 --> 00:45:57,722
that's too cheap or something. Or Drake's not going to get there, that's too lame for him.

814
00:45:57,782 --> 00:46:03,904
He likes this brand better. So a lot of that happened during selection, just selection of

815
00:46:04,164 --> 00:46:08,086
toothbrush and toothpaste, like, oh, they're all organic, they have to go all organic,

816
00:46:08,126 --> 00:46:13,208
and stuff like that. So it's like back and forth of just trying to figure out who these

817
00:46:13,228 --> 00:46:16,709
characters are. And that's what made Uncharted 4 kind of unique, because

818
00:46:17,450 --> 00:46:20,271
In the previous games, they were just like shooting and blowing things up,

819
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:24,432
but this time, you really had to go to their house and figure out who these people are.

820
00:46:24,912 --> 00:46:29,394
And that was probably one of the interesting things in making all of these environments,

821
00:46:29,434 --> 00:46:33,355
is that we had to figure out, like, who are these characters we've been working on.

822
00:46:33,595 --> 00:46:36,396
Unfortunately, it's the last game we're making, so it's like, oh well.

823
00:46:38,617 --> 00:46:38,877
Thank you.

824
00:46:41,025 --> 00:46:45,068
Hi, I find the amazing amount of thought and detail

825
00:46:45,628 --> 00:46:48,470
that goes into your storytelling very inspiring.

826
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:49,811
So congratulations, first of all.

827
00:46:50,051 --> 00:46:50,352
Thank you.

828
00:46:50,992 --> 00:46:53,734
I'll watch big budget movies, era movies,

829
00:46:53,814 --> 00:46:56,296
and the costumes sometimes look like they freshly

830
00:46:56,316 --> 00:46:57,777
came out of the costume department

831
00:46:57,837 --> 00:46:59,298
or wherever they make them.

832
00:46:59,738 --> 00:47:03,440
Cars are polished, don't have any dents.

833
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:06,843
So how come, what was the process for you guys

834
00:47:06,863 --> 00:47:08,904
to come to realize this is so important

835
00:47:08,964 --> 00:47:10,205
and how can you first?

836
00:47:11,899 --> 00:47:18,945
Afford to spend this much time and effort into developing a game like this. How do you?

837
00:47:19,566 --> 00:47:25,951
Plan the timeline so that it goes hand in hand with the engineering effort somewhat not how many people work on

838
00:47:26,732 --> 00:47:27,573
this whole process

839
00:47:29,795 --> 00:47:37,261
How did we determine scope is that like the basic question of it all

840
00:47:39,509 --> 00:47:41,735
Because it's pretty much like a scope question, right?

841
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,321
How do you determine how much assets need to be made,

842
00:47:44,381 --> 00:47:45,805
how much the engineering needs to be made?

843
00:47:46,918 --> 00:47:47,998
And that I actually don't know.

844
00:47:48,018 --> 00:47:50,579
Yeah, how do you guys coordinate this with engineering

845
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:55,381
so that this is not a bottleneck in the whole process?

846
00:47:55,401 --> 00:47:55,921
Do you guys?

847
00:47:56,161 --> 00:47:58,342
I think that a lot of, for me anyway,

848
00:47:58,402 --> 00:48:02,884
working on the cut scenes that are presented today,

849
00:48:03,004 --> 00:48:05,225
we're very self-managed at Naughty Dog.

850
00:48:05,245 --> 00:48:07,626
We really don't have any producers there.

851
00:48:07,766 --> 00:48:11,267
So we have to do the best job we can just

852
00:48:11,287 --> 00:48:13,288
to keep our personal schedule.

853
00:48:14,350 --> 00:48:18,234
you know, in line so we can ship things. And some stuff in there didn't come online

854
00:48:18,294 --> 00:48:23,519
till like literally the week we were going gold. I mean like those 2D images in the

855
00:48:23,579 --> 00:48:27,623
magazine wall I was talking about, those things took like six weeks. And so if you

856
00:48:27,663 --> 00:48:32,527
didn't, if we didn't block it out and plan it off like in the beginning, then I don't

857
00:48:32,547 --> 00:48:35,951
know what we would have ended up with in the end. And that all kind of came down to

858
00:48:35,991 --> 00:48:40,235
just, again, just managing your level. And everybody at Naughty Dog

859
00:48:40,645 --> 00:48:45,195
I mean, has to become very good at managing their level in that regard.

860
00:48:45,215 --> 00:48:49,224
Does that answer your question?

861
00:48:49,866 --> 00:48:50,146
Sort of.

862
00:48:52,592 --> 00:48:55,154
I have just two aspects to my two questions.

863
00:48:55,294 --> 00:48:57,336
The first is with the sheer magnitude of assets

864
00:48:57,356 --> 00:48:59,897
that you guys create, are you able to reutilize any of them

865
00:49:00,018 --> 00:49:03,500
from, say, Uncharted 4 in the next Last of Us?

866
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,101
Is there any kind of recycling that you can do?

867
00:49:05,121 --> 00:49:06,082
Oh yeah, yeah, definitely.

868
00:49:06,162 --> 00:49:09,985
We always plan on assets that we can recycle over

869
00:49:10,085 --> 00:49:12,586
and either change the color or a little bit of style.

870
00:49:13,007 --> 00:49:14,508
Most of the time, most of the assets

871
00:49:14,588 --> 00:49:15,929
came from previous games.

872
00:49:16,389 --> 00:49:18,130
And what happened was, because it's PlayStation 3,

873
00:49:18,170 --> 00:49:20,072
we sort of had to next gen it.

874
00:49:20,692 --> 00:49:24,935
So a lot of our assets are being moved forward and just like updated.

875
00:49:26,516 --> 00:49:32,720
Brilliant segue because I haven't experienced the Uncharted update release of the Nathan Drake collection on PS4.

876
00:49:33,320 --> 00:49:40,925
Since you guys are always iterating up to the last second, did you guys revisit things about the original games for the PS4 remaster?

877
00:49:41,365 --> 00:49:47,629
Such as like changing the cutscenes from pre-rendered to live or changing the environments in that version?

878
00:49:48,547 --> 00:49:53,791
I think we always, I think as a rule in Naughty Dog, we always like have post mortems in the

879
00:49:53,912 --> 00:49:57,855
end and we take it very seriously and we try to improve pipelines.

880
00:49:58,276 --> 00:50:01,879
Like for example, like our lighting engine, we change it almost every game.

881
00:50:02,179 --> 00:50:07,424
Our game engine, we always change it every game just to keep on pushing, to squeeze out

882
00:50:07,464 --> 00:50:08,725
more from the PlayStation.

883
00:50:09,266 --> 00:50:12,389
So it's sort of natural for us to always like...

884
00:50:13,149 --> 00:50:18,495
Revisit our pipeline and how we do things our engines and our tools and just even redo it from scratch

885
00:50:19,977 --> 00:50:20,637
Thank you kindly

886
00:50:21,378 --> 00:50:22,860
Hi

887
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:28,206
So I'm completely amazed by the environments in uncharted 4 is

888
00:50:29,046 --> 00:50:31,469
Is this perfect blend of art and technology?

889
00:50:32,590 --> 00:50:32,851
I think

890
00:50:34,884 --> 00:50:38,465
One of my biggest questions when I was playing the game is,

891
00:50:39,385 --> 00:50:41,966
kind of what they asked before, is how do you

892
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:43,546
manage all those assets?

893
00:50:44,306 --> 00:50:46,527
Because I guess you have outsourcing people,

894
00:50:47,207 --> 00:50:49,027
people working outside of the studio, right?

895
00:50:49,607 --> 00:50:52,988
But at what point do you say, OK, we need to fill this?

896
00:50:53,328 --> 00:50:57,209
It's like, now we know everything we want here,

897
00:50:57,829 --> 00:51:00,170
so all these assets come from outside,

898
00:51:00,210 --> 00:51:02,610
and you have one guy putting everything there?

899
00:51:02,630 --> 00:51:03,291
How do you?

900
00:51:03,551 --> 00:51:04,371
We have three guys.

901
00:51:04,952 --> 00:51:06,437
Okay.

902
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:08,284
Seriously.

903
00:51:08,605 --> 00:51:09,127
Who else?

904
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:09,568
Who else?

905
00:51:10,638 --> 00:51:11,718
I don't know who the third guy is.

906
00:51:11,758 --> 00:51:15,119
But anyways, yeah, we actually don't have a lot of people.

907
00:51:15,179 --> 00:51:18,120
But we do a lot of, because we've been doing this for a

908
00:51:18,140 --> 00:51:22,621
while, we kind of can predict how much is needed.

909
00:51:22,721 --> 00:51:26,441
So in one of the slides, once it's even block mesh, you can

910
00:51:26,481 --> 00:51:29,302
sort of imagine, OK, you're going to need this, this, this,

911
00:51:29,342 --> 00:51:31,903
this, and so that asset list is already generated early.

912
00:51:32,403 --> 00:51:34,083
And so you can predict stuff.

913
00:51:34,223 --> 00:51:37,264
We've done enough environments, I guess, to know

914
00:51:37,684 --> 00:51:39,204
what are the basic stuff, and then we can

915
00:51:39,284 --> 00:51:40,205
always add on to it.

916
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:45,890
In terms of managing, I guess we have, that's a totally different talk, that's like we have

917
00:51:45,930 --> 00:51:50,574
a management software where we can track everyone's task and stuff.

918
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:54,617
So you have tools to fill these gaps, right?

919
00:51:54,637 --> 00:51:55,678
Yeah, yeah.

920
00:51:55,798 --> 00:51:58,581
It's a task management software, that's pretty much what it is.

921
00:51:59,121 --> 00:52:00,182
Awesome.

922
00:52:00,242 --> 00:52:02,524
Thank you and we are waiting for Last of Us too.

923
00:52:04,146 --> 00:52:04,426
Me too.

924
00:52:08,774 --> 00:52:13,696
Oh, question about the, as far as in-game cinematics,

925
00:52:14,957 --> 00:52:18,599
in-game environments versus your cinematic environments,

926
00:52:19,380 --> 00:52:20,220
how did you come to...

927
00:52:21,356 --> 00:52:23,077
balance out the footprint of the space?

928
00:52:23,097 --> 00:52:24,538
Because a lot of times, like, you know,

929
00:52:24,999 --> 00:52:28,201
if it's in-game, you have to consider player movement,

930
00:52:28,221 --> 00:52:31,763
and visual clutter and stuff all over the place

931
00:52:31,803 --> 00:52:33,665
definitely interferes with that, as you mentioned.

932
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:37,287
So, like, did it matter that, I mean,

933
00:52:37,327 --> 00:52:39,268
is there a difference between the size

934
00:52:39,308 --> 00:52:41,430
of the in-game spaces and the cinematic spaces?

935
00:52:41,470 --> 00:52:42,731
If you load it up, you'll notice

936
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:44,092
the environments are usually 25% bigger.

937
00:52:45,773 --> 00:52:47,934
And the spacing, we figured that out

938
00:52:47,974 --> 00:52:50,576
because the player has like a sphere

939
00:52:50,636 --> 00:52:52,317
for basically its collision,

940
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:55,558
and you can test it out to see if he can go through spaces.

941
00:52:55,618 --> 00:53:01,282
So normally we would leave some space in the pathways

942
00:53:01,422 --> 00:53:03,843
to make sure the player won't snag

943
00:53:03,903 --> 00:53:05,184
or get caught in the collision.

944
00:53:05,224 --> 00:53:07,305
But if you notice, if you open the file,

945
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:09,966
everything is scaled 25% bigger,

946
00:53:09,986 --> 00:53:13,428
and that has something to do as well with the camera.

947
00:53:15,407 --> 00:53:16,007
Okay, thanks.

948
00:53:17,888 --> 00:53:19,109
Hi, thanks for the talk.

949
00:53:19,769 --> 00:53:24,652
I would like to ask you guys about your pipelines, and in specific, how do you guys, the art

950
00:53:24,692 --> 00:53:26,093
team, connect with the design team?

951
00:53:26,433 --> 00:53:31,776
Like, you showed us the blockout of the hotel environment, and then you said that, I mean,

952
00:53:31,896 --> 00:53:36,179
the first question basically is, are those blockouts made by a designer or the artists?

953
00:53:37,182 --> 00:53:38,704
It depends.

954
00:53:38,884 --> 00:53:41,547
On cinematics, the artist makes the block out.

955
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,110
And in design, in the in-game one,

956
00:53:44,170 --> 00:53:45,632
it's the designer who makes the block out.

957
00:53:46,033 --> 00:53:48,256
So there's two kinds of block outs too.

958
00:53:48,296 --> 00:53:49,637
It's like the design block out,

959
00:53:50,438 --> 00:53:54,684
which is very primitive and only figures out game design.

960
00:53:55,464 --> 00:53:58,667
Some designers are artists too, so they can elevate that,

961
00:53:59,088 --> 00:54:01,710
but what we do is we take an additional step for the artist

962
00:54:01,730 --> 00:54:04,693
to go over that block mesh and art it up more

963
00:54:05,273 --> 00:54:07,415
where they're considering sizing

964
00:54:07,695 --> 00:54:11,118
and visuals and aesthetics for it.

965
00:54:11,158 --> 00:54:14,181
So there's different levels of blocking out

966
00:54:14,301 --> 00:54:16,623
and different people that are doing it, yeah.

967
00:54:17,043 --> 00:54:23,446
Okay, and the second part about concept art, because you said you got the blockout sometimes overpainted by artists,

968
00:54:23,846 --> 00:54:30,608
but you also use concept art as, I don't know, inspiration for the setting, how you can set the setting, how you can set up the lighting.

969
00:54:30,928 --> 00:54:33,609
So, how do you approach concept art basically?

970
00:54:33,789 --> 00:54:36,490
So, concept art, there's two kinds, or there's multiple kinds.

971
00:54:36,750 --> 00:54:43,992
One is like a previs, where they have no blockout, they just have a general idea from the creative director of what...

972
00:54:44,932 --> 00:54:47,354
he wants to see, it's more of like a mood board.

973
00:54:47,794 --> 00:54:50,337
And then after that, you move into the production concept

974
00:54:50,357 --> 00:54:52,799
part, which is more of you already have a gameplay

975
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:55,201
and block mesh, and then you give it to him to just flesh

976
00:54:55,261 --> 00:54:56,983
out the details and the look.

977
00:54:57,543 --> 00:55:00,546
And then you also have, which is like lighting keys,

978
00:55:00,646 --> 00:55:03,429
which is more focused on the relationship

979
00:55:03,469 --> 00:55:05,050
between the environment and the characters

980
00:55:05,110 --> 00:55:06,572
and how the lighting affects both.

981
00:55:07,312 --> 00:55:08,473
Okay, thanks so much guys.

982
00:55:09,114 --> 00:55:09,314
Thank you.

983
00:55:11,710 --> 00:55:18,031
Hi. First off, thank you very much for coming out. My question was mostly about how you

984
00:55:18,071 --> 00:55:22,613
maintain cohesion within your environments. So you say that you're very self-managed. Is

985
00:55:22,633 --> 00:55:29,094
there some tricks that either you personally have or you as a team use to keep that very

986
00:55:29,134 --> 00:55:29,835
strict cohesion?

987
00:55:30,454 --> 00:55:31,995
Cohesion and visual cohesion?

988
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:33,296
Like keeping the game...

989
00:55:33,456 --> 00:55:35,977
Yeah, cohesion like within visuals and within like,

990
00:55:36,618 --> 00:55:39,659
you know, Nathan and Elena are very organic, like you said.

991
00:55:41,721 --> 00:55:43,962
Keeping like the cohesion of the characters

992
00:55:44,562 --> 00:55:45,803
and the environment storytelling.

993
00:55:46,884 --> 00:55:50,005
Organizationally, I guess we have a lot of meetings

994
00:55:50,106 --> 00:55:50,646
and reviews.

995
00:55:52,257 --> 00:55:56,341
We review it very, like almost every week or twice a week.

996
00:55:56,862 --> 00:56:00,065
And that's pretty much how we maintain the look.

997
00:56:00,326 --> 00:56:02,168
And then we spot things that throw us off,

998
00:56:02,228 --> 00:56:04,130
and then we say, you know, that's not Drake,

999
00:56:04,190 --> 00:56:05,652
that Drake wouldn't do that or whatever.

1000
00:56:06,112 --> 00:56:08,775
And so, yeah, we keep an eye on that a lot.

1001
00:56:08,855 --> 00:56:10,837
And I guess it's just through meetings that we do.

1002
00:56:12,939 --> 00:56:15,541
In the beginning, we also define that in the concept,

1003
00:56:15,861 --> 00:56:19,043
like in costumes, we look at the different kinds of clothing

1004
00:56:19,063 --> 00:56:21,244
that each of them wear, and we try to match that

1005
00:56:21,264 --> 00:56:22,905
with the environment so that it doesn't clash

1006
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:23,926
and it makes sense.

1007
00:56:24,466 --> 00:56:26,127
So we also do that kind of stuff,

1008
00:56:26,167 --> 00:56:28,969
where matching what they wear, the hairstyle,

1009
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:31,851
how much clothing they're gonna be,

1010
00:56:31,911 --> 00:56:34,172
and depending on the environment they're gonna be in.

1011
00:56:34,493 --> 00:56:35,753
So if it's like a snowy level,

1012
00:56:35,773 --> 00:56:37,975
they're gonna be wearing thicker clothes and stuff.

1013
00:56:37,995 --> 00:56:40,697
Yeah, that's pretty much how we do it.

1014
00:56:40,957 --> 00:56:41,238
Thank you.

1015
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:44,927
Cool.

1016
00:56:44,947 --> 00:56:45,528
I think we're good.

1017
00:56:45,548 --> 00:56:45,969
Thank you very much.

1018
00:56:45,989 --> 00:56:46,210
Thanks, guys.

1019
00:56:46,230 --> 00:56:46,470
Thanks, guys.

1020
00:56:46,491 --> 00:56:46,671
All right.

1021
00:56:46,691 --> 00:56:46,932
Thanks, guys.

1022
00:56:46,952 --> 00:56:47,132
All right.
