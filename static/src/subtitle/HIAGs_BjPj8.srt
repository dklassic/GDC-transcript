1
00:00:04,861 --> 00:00:06,362
OK.

2
00:00:06,362 --> 00:00:07,402
Cool.

3
00:00:07,402 --> 00:00:09,724
Great to see that you came here today.

4
00:00:09,724 --> 00:00:12,145
It was the toughest possible competition, Diablo 3

5
00:00:12,145 --> 00:00:15,887
post-mortem in the other hall, and Friday afternoon.

6
00:00:15,887 --> 00:00:18,709
So thank you for showing up.

7
00:00:18,709 --> 00:00:21,050
My name is Fred, and I have the privilege

8
00:00:21,050 --> 00:00:24,973
of being the CEO and president of Paradox Interactive, which

9
00:00:24,973 --> 00:00:28,335
has been growing really rapidly in the past two, three years.

10
00:00:29,590 --> 00:00:31,771
And you might know us from titles like Crusader Kings,

11
00:00:31,771 --> 00:00:34,852
Europa, and Versales, Cities Skylines, Magicka.

12
00:00:34,852 --> 00:00:39,533
And today I'm going to talk about business models.

13
00:00:39,533 --> 00:00:40,914
And I think that in our industry,

14
00:00:40,914 --> 00:00:42,935
we don't talk about business enough.

15
00:00:42,935 --> 00:00:45,695
So I used to work more with games 10 years ago,

16
00:00:45,695 --> 00:00:47,356
when the studio was small.

17
00:00:47,356 --> 00:00:50,397
And I was kind of, even if I was the sales and marketing

18
00:00:50,397 --> 00:00:53,698
guy all the time, I still was a part of the games development

19
00:00:53,698 --> 00:00:54,238
team as well.

20
00:00:54,238 --> 00:00:57,239
But the more I moved out of the games development team,

21
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:59,200
the better games we started creating.

22
00:01:00,512 --> 00:01:04,214
And even more so, the better business we started making,

23
00:01:04,214 --> 00:01:06,716
because I could focus on what I do best.

24
00:01:06,716 --> 00:01:09,558
So my goal of today is to actually make

25
00:01:09,558 --> 00:01:12,620
more game developers talk about business and business models.

26
00:01:12,620 --> 00:01:18,905
And this is one of my favorite all-time quotes

27
00:01:18,905 --> 00:01:20,226
from Warren Buffett.

28
00:01:21,102 --> 00:01:23,763
Price is what you pay and value is what you get.

29
00:01:23,763 --> 00:01:26,144
Because all markets are basically imperfect,

30
00:01:26,144 --> 00:01:29,306
because we value things totally different.

31
00:01:29,306 --> 00:01:32,107
So someone might value Europa Universalis

32
00:01:32,107 --> 00:01:36,088
at the price of $2,000, because they're putting 4,000 hours

33
00:01:36,088 --> 00:01:36,849
into the game.

34
00:01:36,849 --> 00:01:39,710
Some other people might value this at $1 or $2,

35
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:42,691
because they'd like just to see what it is,

36
00:01:42,691 --> 00:01:46,493
play it for a little while, and then let it be and have it

37
00:01:46,493 --> 00:01:47,533
in their Steam catalog.

38
00:01:48,081 --> 00:01:54,603
Now, price discrimination doesn't allow us to do that, to charge exactly what people

39
00:01:54,603 --> 00:01:56,704
want to pay for something.

40
00:01:56,704 --> 00:02:00,225
So all markets are in some ways imperfect.

41
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:04,287
But once you move into a digital world like we're in, most of us in here, we move away

42
00:02:04,287 --> 00:02:08,749
from retail boxes, we can start experimenting much more, both on the pricing side and on

43
00:02:08,749 --> 00:02:09,889
the business model side.

44
00:02:11,710 --> 00:02:16,096
So I'm going to show you some models that we use at Paradox, how we start with a game,

45
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:20,601
how we integrate the business model, and how we integrate people around the business model,

46
00:02:20,601 --> 00:02:22,704
the value creators that we're working with.

47
00:02:22,704 --> 00:02:27,129
So we are not the only ones making value for our own titles, for our own games.

48
00:02:30,067 --> 00:02:35,232
And starting just by, like, I'm going to use a few words that I come back to here,

49
00:02:35,232 --> 00:02:38,054
and maybe some of you are not familiar with these words,

50
00:02:38,054 --> 00:02:40,276
but business model.

51
00:02:40,276 --> 00:02:42,358
Once you hear that, what is a business model?

52
00:02:42,358 --> 00:02:46,782
Well, it's basically how do you make money?

53
00:02:46,782 --> 00:02:49,805
So even if you don't talk about business models,

54
00:02:49,805 --> 00:02:51,846
you will have a business model in your company

55
00:02:51,846 --> 00:02:53,508
if you have revenue coming into the company.

56
00:02:55,103 --> 00:02:57,406
The second one is value proposition.

57
00:02:57,406 --> 00:03:00,549
And value proposition is the promised value

58
00:03:00,549 --> 00:03:03,772
that you're supposed to deliver to a customer who's

59
00:03:03,772 --> 00:03:05,173
going to use your product.

60
00:03:05,173 --> 00:03:08,637
And that has also been approved by said customer.

61
00:03:08,637 --> 00:03:13,301
And the value chain is everyone who

62
00:03:13,301 --> 00:03:16,164
creates value to put together the value proposition.

63
00:03:16,164 --> 00:03:18,807
Are you with me?

64
00:03:18,807 --> 00:03:19,067
Cool.

65
00:03:20,095 --> 00:03:21,956
This is all CEO art as well.

66
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:22,797
Did I mention that?

67
00:03:22,797 --> 00:03:27,940
I made this presentation myself, so it might look a bit so-so.

68
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:30,302
So when you build value chains and business model,

69
00:03:30,302 --> 00:03:31,442
you have to start somewhere.

70
00:03:31,442 --> 00:03:34,184
You have to start like, where do we start talking about this?

71
00:03:34,184 --> 00:03:35,905
Where do we start building our business models?

72
00:03:35,905 --> 00:03:39,327
And the first thing you should talk about at your studio

73
00:03:39,327 --> 00:03:43,090
or whatever business you run is, how do we want to make money?

74
00:03:45,157 --> 00:03:50,259
Not only what are we charging for the products, but philosophically, how do we want to make money?

75
00:03:50,259 --> 00:03:52,440
How do we want to sell our products to our customers?

76
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:57,983
Like, at Paradox, we've said that we do not want to monetize frustration.

77
00:03:57,983 --> 00:04:00,284
That's one of our key pillars in our business model.

78
00:04:00,284 --> 00:04:07,828
Meaning that, if your character dies in Crusader Kings 2, you cannot buy him back for a dollar.

79
00:04:09,337 --> 00:04:12,782
That would be a bit so-so, because people would be frustrated, right?

80
00:04:12,782 --> 00:04:14,284
And then you can pay your way out of that.

81
00:04:14,284 --> 00:04:16,628
We don't think that's a good way to approach a brand.

82
00:04:16,628 --> 00:04:18,991
So we want people to pay for our games

83
00:04:18,991 --> 00:04:23,738
when they're at, like, really stoked to play something new.

84
00:04:27,028 --> 00:04:29,069
Also, getting the team excited about the numbers.

85
00:04:29,069 --> 00:04:30,450
Start talking about the numbers.

86
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,352
Saying, what are our goals with this?

87
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:35,534
Not only on the money side, it could be other key performance

88
00:04:35,534 --> 00:04:36,976
indicators as well.

89
00:04:36,976 --> 00:04:39,377
But just get the team excited about the numbers.

90
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:43,060
Because once we started to get our development team more

91
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,023
excited about the numbers, we started to make better games.

92
00:04:46,023 --> 00:04:47,083
Fact.

93
00:04:47,083 --> 00:04:51,207
You also need a customer approval.

94
00:04:52,262 --> 00:04:54,563
I'm going to get back to this as well, because the customers

95
00:04:54,563 --> 00:04:56,883
are a part of everything you do all the time.

96
00:04:56,883 --> 00:04:58,184
They will have opinions about it.

97
00:04:58,184 --> 00:05:00,685
They will tell you when they think you make mistakes.

98
00:05:00,685 --> 00:05:04,366
And they will turn on you if you make enough mistakes

99
00:05:04,366 --> 00:05:05,746
in a short while.

100
00:05:05,746 --> 00:05:10,307
Also, get the customer engagement

101
00:05:10,307 --> 00:05:12,668
so that they will drive the process further.

102
00:05:12,668 --> 00:05:14,588
Not only approval, but asking like,

103
00:05:14,588 --> 00:05:17,369
how can you help us evolve our business models

104
00:05:17,369 --> 00:05:19,130
and our value proposition, and both.

105
00:05:22,596 --> 00:05:24,778
So intro, we start with the games, right?

106
00:05:24,778 --> 00:05:27,420
Because everyone here, how many are game developers in here?

107
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:27,820
Hands up.

108
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:29,482
Most of you.

109
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,945
And the people who work in sales and marketing, anyone?

110
00:05:32,945 --> 00:05:34,886
Few as well.

111
00:05:34,886 --> 00:05:35,226
Any media?

112
00:05:35,226 --> 00:05:38,329
No media, that's good.

113
00:05:38,329 --> 00:05:40,211
Then I can speak freely, that's very good.

114
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:40,751
Good, we start with the game.

115
00:05:40,751 --> 00:05:44,434
So when we look at a new game, we

116
00:05:44,434 --> 00:05:47,537
look at something from the internal studio,

117
00:05:47,537 --> 00:05:49,138
or we look to publish something.

118
00:05:49,138 --> 00:05:50,399
We talk about three things.

119
00:05:51,912 --> 00:05:55,633
And the first thing is, do we have the passion to do this game?

120
00:05:55,633 --> 00:06:00,195
Do we think that we have the people who will walk 10 extra miles

121
00:06:00,195 --> 00:06:01,335
to make this game really good?

122
00:06:01,335 --> 00:06:06,737
The second one is market.

123
00:06:06,737 --> 00:06:10,058
Is there actually a market for a game like this?

124
00:06:10,058 --> 00:06:12,139
If there's an established competitor, for example,

125
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,420
you can always look at the competitor,

126
00:06:14,420 --> 00:06:15,820
but if you're creating something new,

127
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:18,902
you have to kind of second-guess if there's a market or not,

128
00:06:18,902 --> 00:06:20,222
trying to quantify it.

129
00:06:20,222 --> 00:06:20,622
But still...

130
00:06:22,982 --> 00:06:24,343
And the third one, obviously, is skill.

131
00:06:24,343 --> 00:06:27,063
Do we have the skills to do this?

132
00:06:27,063 --> 00:06:29,704
Passion is not enough to actually complete

133
00:06:29,704 --> 00:06:31,284
the project that's going to be world class.

134
00:06:31,284 --> 00:06:32,945
So you need the skills to do it.

135
00:06:32,945 --> 00:06:34,545
Do we have the resources to actually pull through?

136
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:38,546
The resources are not only on the development side.

137
00:06:38,546 --> 00:06:40,567
It's also on the sales and marketing side.

138
00:06:40,567 --> 00:06:42,307
We've had numerous discussions.

139
00:06:42,307 --> 00:06:44,588
This is 10 years ago.

140
00:06:44,588 --> 00:06:47,929
But still, whether a good game sells itself.

141
00:06:47,929 --> 00:06:51,410
How many in here would say a good game sells itself?

142
00:06:52,243 --> 00:06:53,384
Anyone?

143
00:06:53,384 --> 00:06:55,205
Yeah, a few really brave souls.

144
00:06:55,205 --> 00:06:58,626
That's good.

145
00:06:58,626 --> 00:07:01,587
So let's look at our funnel.

146
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:04,148
How tight is the Paradox funnel?

147
00:07:04,148 --> 00:07:07,289
When we look at new games and new time, how critical are we

148
00:07:07,289 --> 00:07:10,550
about new concepts coming into Paradox, or old concepts, for

149
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:12,031
that matter?

150
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:15,612
I once was pitched a game called Fish Tetris, which was

151
00:07:15,612 --> 00:07:17,373
you should match fishes against each

152
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,254
other to remove them.

153
00:07:19,254 --> 00:07:21,555
That's one of the most terrible pitches I've ever seen.

154
00:07:22,939 --> 00:07:27,400
And that's one, probably of the 400 in here, 401, specifically,

155
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:28,421
something like fish tetras.

156
00:07:28,421 --> 00:07:32,322
Those were the pitches received total in 2015

157
00:07:32,322 --> 00:07:34,903
to Paradox Interactive, 401 pitches in total,

158
00:07:34,903 --> 00:07:38,124
which is more than one pitch a day.

159
00:07:38,124 --> 00:07:43,765
And of the 400 pitches, 20 went to the Green Light Committee

160
00:07:43,765 --> 00:07:45,046
for further research.

161
00:07:46,102 --> 00:07:50,225
And the games that we are actually signing for further,

162
00:07:50,225 --> 00:07:53,368
like up until prototype, is between one and three.

163
00:07:53,368 --> 00:07:55,730
Probably all three of them.

164
00:07:55,730 --> 00:07:57,271
But at least one of those projects

165
00:07:57,271 --> 00:07:59,653
will be closed before it reaches prototype stage.

166
00:07:59,653 --> 00:08:02,195
That's how tight the funnel is.

167
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,678
And then you go over to what are the reasons for declining

168
00:08:05,678 --> 00:08:07,579
so many games.

169
00:08:07,579 --> 00:08:10,021
First of all, there are genre issues.

170
00:08:10,021 --> 00:08:12,663
We have decided what makes a Paradox game.

171
00:08:12,663 --> 00:08:15,045
And I'm going to come back to that with even more C-E-O-R.

172
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,902
We stand for something.

173
00:08:18,902 --> 00:08:22,526
And if the game doesn't stand for the same thing as we do,

174
00:08:22,526 --> 00:08:24,188
we can't sign the game, no matter how good it is.

175
00:08:24,188 --> 00:08:27,551
Then you have pillar issues, which

176
00:08:27,551 --> 00:08:28,932
is very, very game-specific.

177
00:08:28,932 --> 00:08:32,015
And then you have, of course, development issues as well.

178
00:08:32,015 --> 00:08:34,177
Is the developer not the right developer?

179
00:08:34,177 --> 00:08:36,940
We don't think they can actually make this game happen.

180
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:40,143
Just to give you a glance on how we work.

181
00:08:42,408 --> 00:08:44,789
The first thing we do when we look at a new game

182
00:08:44,789 --> 00:08:47,790
or look at a new project overall is setting the vision.

183
00:08:47,790 --> 00:08:49,770
And a vision is really important

184
00:08:49,770 --> 00:08:51,091
because when you look at the wall

185
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,872
and you see the vision every day, you can unite your team.

186
00:08:54,872 --> 00:08:57,353
There are a couple of good visions out there.

187
00:08:57,353 --> 00:09:01,294
I mean, we use for our upcoming space game Stellaris.

188
00:09:01,294 --> 00:09:04,675
The galaxy is vast and full of wonders.

189
00:09:04,675 --> 00:09:06,476
So what does that say when you look at it?

190
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:09,657
It says that it's kind of different from our other games.

191
00:09:10,285 --> 00:09:14,547
because Europa Universalis is...

192
00:09:14,547 --> 00:09:16,087
there is no exploration in that game.

193
00:09:16,087 --> 00:09:20,288
So the implicated thing in Solaris is that it starts with exploration.

194
00:09:20,288 --> 00:09:24,670
For example, they can interpret this in many different ways, of course,

195
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:27,250
but you can unite the team behind the vision.

196
00:09:27,250 --> 00:09:30,692
My absolute favorite vision, I think it's the vision at least,

197
00:09:30,692 --> 00:09:33,152
that's what I heard, is for Gears of War.

198
00:09:33,152 --> 00:09:36,793
And, very easy to understand,

199
00:09:36,793 --> 00:09:38,994
Marcus Fenix is a badass.

200
00:09:40,255 --> 00:09:41,416
That's good.

201
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,636
Why is that a good vision?

202
00:09:42,636 --> 00:09:45,217
Because when you look at Marcus Fenix,

203
00:09:45,217 --> 00:09:46,458
you see he's a badass.

204
00:09:46,458 --> 00:09:49,839
The artists who work with Marcus Fenix

205
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:52,740
knows that he should be painted as a badass.

206
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,841
He doesn't open doors.

207
00:09:53,841 --> 00:09:56,002
He kicks doors in because he's a badass.

208
00:09:56,002 --> 00:09:57,803
So everything in the game design,

209
00:09:57,803 --> 00:09:58,843
everything in the art,

210
00:09:58,843 --> 00:10:00,584
everything in the level design

211
00:10:00,584 --> 00:10:02,344
implies that he's a badass.

212
00:10:02,344 --> 00:10:03,805
Everyone can get behind that.

213
00:10:03,805 --> 00:10:07,647
So why do you actually set this vision,

214
00:10:07,647 --> 00:10:08,987
and why is it so important?

215
00:10:10,063 --> 00:10:13,026
You help the team find the direction of what they do.

216
00:10:13,026 --> 00:10:16,088
It's really easy to communicate to your fans.

217
00:10:16,088 --> 00:10:19,311
It's part of your marketing plan as well.

218
00:10:19,311 --> 00:10:22,354
You can find angles in the marketing that actually

219
00:10:22,354 --> 00:10:26,598
explains the vision and even deepens it even more.

220
00:10:26,598 --> 00:10:28,980
And of course, you identify the priorities as well.

221
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:32,583
You can talk about what's the most badass of these two

222
00:10:32,583 --> 00:10:33,264
choices that we have.

223
00:10:36,084 --> 00:10:37,285
And how do you set this?

224
00:10:37,285 --> 00:10:39,327
A vision is not easily completed.

225
00:10:39,327 --> 00:10:41,189
The worst visions you can ever have

226
00:10:41,189 --> 00:10:44,371
is this is going to be the best strategy game ever.

227
00:10:44,371 --> 00:10:47,794
No one has a clue what they're supposed to do.

228
00:10:47,794 --> 00:10:49,436
It doesn't set an angle.

229
00:10:49,436 --> 00:10:50,997
It doesn't set a direction.

230
00:10:50,997 --> 00:10:53,560
It just says it's going to be really good once it's finished.

231
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:56,642
Or the best World War II game ever made.

232
00:10:56,642 --> 00:10:58,444
It's a terrible vision.

233
00:10:58,444 --> 00:10:59,064
Terrible.

234
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,667
Could be a statement, or it could

235
00:11:01,667 --> 00:11:03,608
be a general feeling that makes up your visions.

236
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:08,306
And the people making it should be everyone involved

237
00:11:08,306 --> 00:11:08,566
in the team.

238
00:11:08,566 --> 00:11:09,807
And I'll get back to that as well,

239
00:11:09,807 --> 00:11:12,929
why it's so important to mix and match teams

240
00:11:12,929 --> 00:11:16,992
between not only development, but also sales, marketing,

241
00:11:16,992 --> 00:11:18,232
and all other parts of the company.

242
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,053
Dreaming big is the next step.

243
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:23,235
We feel that, OK, we're doing something new here,

244
00:11:23,235 --> 00:11:27,318
something new, cool, that people should be excited about.

245
00:11:27,318 --> 00:11:30,160
So we'll dream 18 to 24 months ahead.

246
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:31,921
The game is already out there.

247
00:11:31,921 --> 00:11:32,661
It's a big success.

248
00:11:32,661 --> 00:11:34,603
Everyone wants to play it.

249
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:37,943
So who is playing this game?

250
00:11:37,943 --> 00:11:41,884
If it was a book written on this game, who would write the book

251
00:11:41,884 --> 00:11:43,905
and what type of book would that be?

252
00:11:43,905 --> 00:11:44,965
Who would be the author?

253
00:11:44,965 --> 00:11:49,906
Would it be Stephen King or would it be Ernest Hemingway?

254
00:11:49,906 --> 00:11:51,247
Wear it.

255
00:11:51,247 --> 00:11:53,587
Like, how do you cosplay this game?

256
00:11:53,587 --> 00:11:55,228
How do you make the game have a soul?

257
00:11:55,228 --> 00:11:58,829
So when someone goes to PAX to show off to their friends,

258
00:11:58,829 --> 00:12:00,109
what do they actually wear?

259
00:12:02,487 --> 00:12:03,128
Watch it.

260
00:12:03,128 --> 00:12:04,548
It's obviously a TV series.

261
00:12:04,548 --> 00:12:06,930
Maybe is it Netflix or HBO?

262
00:12:06,930 --> 00:12:09,171
Is it R-rated or T-rated?

263
00:12:09,171 --> 00:12:14,154
And who's the director for this TV series or a movie?

264
00:12:14,154 --> 00:12:14,854
Build it.

265
00:12:14,854 --> 00:12:18,336
How do we actually get our fans to build things for us?

266
00:12:18,336 --> 00:12:19,897
What do they build in the game?

267
00:12:19,897 --> 00:12:23,239
How do they present it, et cetera?

268
00:12:23,239 --> 00:12:24,840
Preach it is really important.

269
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:27,821
It's like, what do people say about this game

270
00:12:27,821 --> 00:12:30,363
when they're trying to convince their friends to play it?

271
00:12:31,537 --> 00:12:37,038
When we released Europa Universalis 3, our whole tactic was anti-marketing.

272
00:12:37,038 --> 00:12:37,998
And why do you call it that?

273
00:12:37,998 --> 00:12:41,598
Our whole marketing angle was,

274
00:12:41,598 --> 00:12:44,179
maybe this game is too hard for you to play.

275
00:12:44,179 --> 00:12:48,239
And people were like, really? I'm gonna show you.

276
00:12:48,239 --> 00:12:52,420
So we found out that the way most people learned about Paradox Games

277
00:12:52,420 --> 00:12:55,661
was they saw other people playing the Paradox Game

278
00:12:55,661 --> 00:12:58,301
and they asked, what are you playing?

279
00:12:58,301 --> 00:12:59,982
Never mind, I don't think you would get it.

280
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,222
And that provokes a lot of people, obviously.

281
00:13:03,222 --> 00:13:05,364
Some people would be like, OK, OK, I get it.

282
00:13:05,364 --> 00:13:06,085
I'm stupid.

283
00:13:06,085 --> 00:13:07,587
I can probably not play this game.

284
00:13:07,587 --> 00:13:09,409
Other people would be intrigued.

285
00:13:09,409 --> 00:13:11,691
And those were the people we're looking for.

286
00:13:11,691 --> 00:13:15,816
And of course, this summarizes it into a lifestyle.

287
00:13:15,816 --> 00:13:16,397
You'll live it.

288
00:13:16,397 --> 00:13:17,398
You'll live the game.

289
00:13:17,398 --> 00:13:19,640
And so this is the dreaming big scenario

290
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:21,502
that we're using, first the vision, then

291
00:13:21,502 --> 00:13:22,564
how do you dream about this?

292
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:28,110
Which takes us into my game pillars,

293
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,932
which is what actually makes up the game

294
00:13:30,932 --> 00:13:33,354
and how are the different departments of Paradox

295
00:13:33,354 --> 00:13:36,757
involved in what the game actually is.

296
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:40,139
And if we start with what is the game pillar,

297
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:42,001
we have seven different game pillars.

298
00:13:42,001 --> 00:13:46,364
The most important thing about every pillar of our games

299
00:13:46,364 --> 00:13:47,685
is the player value.

300
00:13:47,685 --> 00:13:49,887
You always start with discussing what

301
00:13:49,887 --> 00:13:51,468
is the right for the players.

302
00:13:52,397 --> 00:13:54,179
And the problem with our industry

303
00:13:54,179 --> 00:13:57,822
has been for a long time that there are a lot of big egos

304
00:13:57,822 --> 00:13:59,024
with artistic ambitions.

305
00:13:59,024 --> 00:14:02,247
It can also be a positive thing, but when

306
00:14:02,247 --> 00:14:06,531
it comes to player value first, it's a really big challenge.

307
00:14:06,531 --> 00:14:08,733
And I know I'm one of these egos as well.

308
00:14:08,733 --> 00:14:11,295
Sometimes you have to just put it away and do

309
00:14:11,295 --> 00:14:12,457
what's right for the gamers.

310
00:14:14,305 --> 00:14:17,368
The second most important thing here is the paradox value.

311
00:14:17,368 --> 00:14:20,570
Like, for us as a company, what value does this pillar have?

312
00:14:20,570 --> 00:14:22,351
And how does it match with the gamer value?

313
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:26,635
If we're working with an external developer,

314
00:14:26,635 --> 00:14:28,136
what's their value in this?

315
00:14:28,136 --> 00:14:30,858
Or if the internal studio paradox, what's their value?

316
00:14:33,534 --> 00:14:36,095
Marketing value, the marketing department,

317
00:14:36,095 --> 00:14:38,216
why should this be exciting to them?

318
00:14:38,216 --> 00:14:41,157
Why is this core pillar a really good thing for marketing?

319
00:14:41,157 --> 00:14:43,598
And of course, the people working in sales,

320
00:14:43,598 --> 00:14:45,178
working with our partners, working with Steam,

321
00:14:45,178 --> 00:14:47,419
Microsoft, Sony, et cetera.

322
00:14:47,419 --> 00:14:49,480
Why should they be excited when they're trying

323
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:50,700
to sell and present the game?

324
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,121
Does it make sense?

325
00:14:52,121 --> 00:14:55,922
So we're trying here, our most important feature

326
00:14:55,922 --> 00:14:56,962
of all is replayability.

327
00:14:58,621 --> 00:15:00,842
for people to pick up and play the game again

328
00:15:00,842 --> 00:15:02,944
and have a different experience.

329
00:15:02,944 --> 00:15:06,085
There is something new that they didn't experience before.

330
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:08,947
And the most obvious thing for that, for the gamers,

331
00:15:08,947 --> 00:15:12,169
is that they get a lot of bang for the buck.

332
00:15:12,169 --> 00:15:13,830
It's a lot of value for the gamers.

333
00:15:13,830 --> 00:15:17,572
And the big thing for Paradox is obviously

334
00:15:17,572 --> 00:15:20,014
that we get highly engaged customers, people

335
00:15:20,014 --> 00:15:21,775
who play our games over and over again,

336
00:15:21,775 --> 00:15:26,097
provide us with feedback, and it creates a positive spin

337
00:15:26,097 --> 00:15:27,118
of developing the game further.

338
00:15:29,770 --> 00:15:35,955
The development value here is that you can continue for a long time to continue to develop the game and make it even better.

339
00:15:35,955 --> 00:15:42,179
If you have high engaged fans to play it over and over again, people will continue to support your development.

340
00:15:42,179 --> 00:15:52,327
The marketing value is obviously it's easier to reach the customers because we know they're in-game and we know they're following our social channels, our email channels and everything.

341
00:15:52,327 --> 00:15:54,548
It's very easy to communicate to all the gamers out there.

342
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,283
And the sales value for the people handling the partners

343
00:16:00,283 --> 00:16:01,244
is the attach rate.

344
00:16:01,244 --> 00:16:04,667
So if you release a new piece of DLC or an expansion,

345
00:16:04,667 --> 00:16:07,129
you know that a certain amount of the people

346
00:16:07,129 --> 00:16:09,612
are actually playing the game every month or every day

347
00:16:09,612 --> 00:16:11,293
even are going to buy this expansion or DLC.

348
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:16,158
So business-wise, it actually makes sense.

349
00:16:16,158 --> 00:16:16,919
We also say that.

350
00:16:17,694 --> 00:16:21,755
We are hardcore. We're in the hardcore segment of the gaming markets.

351
00:16:21,755 --> 00:16:25,496
We're not making any casual games. We're targeting niches.

352
00:16:25,496 --> 00:16:30,037
And the player value here is to feel smart.

353
00:16:30,037 --> 00:16:34,638
Right? The whole, maybe you can't really play this game, feeling.

354
00:16:34,638 --> 00:16:38,699
But you can. And you feel smart. It's like being a part of the Illuminati.

355
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:40,700
Only that you're a Paradox Gamer instead.

356
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:44,341
Which is almost as good. You don't really rule the world, but you do it on your computer.

357
00:16:47,067 --> 00:16:49,129
It's like an interactive version of Illuminati.

358
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:53,292
The value for Paradox is obviously

359
00:16:53,292 --> 00:16:55,534
that there is limited competition.

360
00:16:55,534 --> 00:16:58,997
So we don't face, we're not going up against Zynga or King,

361
00:16:58,997 --> 00:17:01,700
in this case, to buy new customers all the time.

362
00:17:01,700 --> 00:17:03,501
So it's a limited competitive space.

363
00:17:03,501 --> 00:17:05,663
So if we make really good games, we

364
00:17:05,663 --> 00:17:06,964
know we can keep the gamers.

365
00:17:10,483 --> 00:17:14,165
The dev value is that there is no bullshit in here.

366
00:17:14,165 --> 00:17:16,086
They can pretty much do whatever they want,

367
00:17:16,086 --> 00:17:17,546
as long as they get the gamer approval.

368
00:17:17,546 --> 00:17:21,108
So it's not only data-driven, but driven by what

369
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:22,389
the gamers say as well.

370
00:17:22,389 --> 00:17:27,091
In the marketing value, it stands out.

371
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:31,292
So it's not just another copy of a copy of a copy of a game

372
00:17:31,292 --> 00:17:33,173
that is trying to churn out new things.

373
00:17:33,173 --> 00:17:35,294
It's actually something that stands out

374
00:17:35,294 --> 00:17:36,595
and has a marketing angle.

375
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:42,414
And the sales value is obviously that the lifetime value of this is going up,

376
00:17:42,414 --> 00:17:44,536
because the hardcore gamers play more.

377
00:17:44,536 --> 00:17:50,222
I'm gonna run through a little faster here, but we do functional reform,

378
00:17:50,222 --> 00:17:54,346
which means that the game doesn't have to be triple A quality

379
00:17:54,346 --> 00:17:57,830
on the side of graphics, for example.

380
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:02,314
Which means that for a player, you don't need the latest and greatest hardware to play the game.

381
00:18:04,430 --> 00:18:08,474
For us, it's a good return of investment because graphic costs a lot of money.

382
00:18:08,474 --> 00:18:10,857
So we can keep the risks down and still keep the upside,

383
00:18:10,857 --> 00:18:14,061
because if a lot of people play the game, we still make a lot of money.

384
00:18:14,061 --> 00:18:17,805
So the risks are lower and the ROI can be really great still.

385
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,333
The dev value here is small teams.

386
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,495
You can work in small teams where you have a lot of say,

387
00:18:24,495 --> 00:18:25,856
so a lot of responsibility.

388
00:18:25,856 --> 00:18:27,478
This doesn't fit all developers.

389
00:18:27,478 --> 00:18:28,378
I know that.

390
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:31,121
But to the people who want to work in small teams,

391
00:18:31,121 --> 00:18:32,542
where actually your opinion counts,

392
00:18:32,542 --> 00:18:34,803
this is the perfect way to do it.

393
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:38,106
So game pillars and everything else with the vision

394
00:18:38,106 --> 00:18:40,127
is not just to attract people.

395
00:18:40,127 --> 00:18:42,589
It's also to define who should not be a part of this.

396
00:18:42,589 --> 00:18:46,412
So if you like large teams, where you only

397
00:18:46,412 --> 00:18:48,474
work on gun sounds for two years in a row.

398
00:18:48,794 --> 00:18:50,095
this is not going to fit you.

399
00:18:50,095 --> 00:18:52,456
So it's really good to be upfront about that as well.

400
00:18:52,456 --> 00:18:54,837
Marketing value, messaging there,

401
00:18:54,837 --> 00:18:57,998
and market accessibility on sales.

402
00:18:57,998 --> 00:19:00,899
We say that we want to make our games accessible,

403
00:19:00,899 --> 00:19:02,600
which you might laugh a bit at.

404
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,821
If you look at the interface on Crusader Kings 2,

405
00:19:04,821 --> 00:19:06,242
it's kind of daunting,

406
00:19:06,242 --> 00:19:09,763
but we're working on this core pillar a lot.

407
00:19:09,763 --> 00:19:11,664
We've identified it as important.

408
00:19:11,664 --> 00:19:13,785
So player value is no frustration.

409
00:19:15,247 --> 00:19:17,467
And for us, value for the whole company

410
00:19:17,467 --> 00:19:19,848
is that we reach a wider audience.

411
00:19:19,848 --> 00:19:23,010
The dev value is that the stickiness of the product

412
00:19:23,010 --> 00:19:23,910
is going to increase.

413
00:19:23,910 --> 00:19:25,471
Because if you learn the game quicker,

414
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:27,131
you're going to keep on playing.

415
00:19:27,131 --> 00:19:30,073
We've seen that on data as well.

416
00:19:30,073 --> 00:19:32,033
Market value is that you can explain the game.

417
00:19:32,033 --> 00:19:35,415
And the sales value is the promotion potential.

418
00:19:35,415 --> 00:19:37,155
Because if you have all the other things,

419
00:19:37,155 --> 00:19:41,177
the promotion potential and to sell at a lower price

420
00:19:41,177 --> 00:19:43,038
increases a lot as well over time.

421
00:19:47,671 --> 00:19:56,793
Creative is a little bit fuzzy, but give the ability for people to create their own things like modding, for example, in the game.

422
00:19:56,793 --> 00:20:01,594
Make it easy for people to make YouTube videos. That's the creative part of this.

423
00:20:01,594 --> 00:20:08,136
So for the gamer, it's a self-expression thing. People love to do things. So people make mods without being paid, right?

424
00:20:08,136 --> 00:20:12,276
The Crusader Kings 2 Game of Thrones mod is a super ambitious product.

425
00:20:12,857 --> 00:20:16,478
And they can't charge for it, because HBO would shut them

426
00:20:16,478 --> 00:20:19,279
down, which is reasonable, because it's not their IP.

427
00:20:19,279 --> 00:20:23,641
But still, it drives a lot of traffic for us as well.

428
00:20:23,641 --> 00:20:26,782
Like I was touching here, it's a lot of value

429
00:20:26,782 --> 00:20:27,622
creation for Paradox.

430
00:20:27,622 --> 00:20:30,423
If you just allow people to go crazy with your products,

431
00:20:30,423 --> 00:20:33,364
they're going to create a lot of value.

432
00:20:33,364 --> 00:20:37,586
And taken together, we have 5 million registered Paradox

433
00:20:37,586 --> 00:20:39,106
customers right now.

434
00:20:39,106 --> 00:20:40,987
It's increasing by 300,000 a month.

435
00:20:43,333 --> 00:20:47,896
Collectively, they are obviously a lot smarter than we are.

436
00:20:47,896 --> 00:20:50,397
We're only 200 people at two offices.

437
00:20:50,397 --> 00:20:53,820
So if we can combine the thinking of five million people

438
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,141
instead of just being 200 creating things,

439
00:20:56,141 --> 00:20:57,802
we're up for something good going forward.

440
00:20:57,802 --> 00:21:00,845
For the devs, it's a good way to find talent.

441
00:21:00,845 --> 00:21:04,547
We find sometimes people who made mods for us,

442
00:21:04,547 --> 00:21:07,229
made YouTube videos or whatever to help us out

443
00:21:07,229 --> 00:21:08,830
and to carry the company forward.

444
00:21:08,830 --> 00:21:11,132
So you could call it a recruitment process as well.

445
00:21:13,425 --> 00:21:15,846
Obviously, it's free marketing.

446
00:21:15,846 --> 00:21:19,587
And the potential, I mean, user generated content

447
00:21:19,587 --> 00:21:21,247
is like a swearing word right now,

448
00:21:21,247 --> 00:21:23,507
after the Skyrim debacle and all of that.

449
00:21:23,507 --> 00:21:27,048
But still, we've used a lot of things created by people

450
00:21:27,048 --> 00:21:28,468
to sell them to our other users.

451
00:21:28,468 --> 00:21:29,949
And they get really well paid.

452
00:21:29,949 --> 00:21:33,389
So there's a huge potential that is, to a large extent,

453
00:21:33,389 --> 00:21:36,250
untapped, except for Valve, who does it really well for Dota 2,

454
00:21:36,250 --> 00:21:37,990
for example, and for Team Fortress.

455
00:21:40,175 --> 00:21:42,937
We have high engagement subject matters,

456
00:21:42,937 --> 00:21:44,178
like history is one of those,

457
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:48,160
that people are super engaged, like World War II,

458
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:50,442
which means that they can nerd out.

459
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:54,064
So my, it has a backside as well.

460
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:56,986
So once you start a thread on the Hearts of Iron forum,

461
00:21:56,986 --> 00:21:58,687
Hearts of Iron is a World War II game,

462
00:21:58,687 --> 00:22:03,029
which is, which do you think was the best tank

463
00:22:03,029 --> 00:22:03,910
during World War II?

464
00:22:03,910 --> 00:22:07,332
You have to close the thread after an hour

465
00:22:07,332 --> 00:22:08,273
due to flame wars.

466
00:22:09,515 --> 00:22:11,937
Which is, but the nerding out thing, I got,

467
00:22:11,937 --> 00:22:14,199
Hearts of Iron is a good example,

468
00:22:14,199 --> 00:22:16,261
because we had a lot of technologies and generals.

469
00:22:16,261 --> 00:22:20,604
I don't remember how many, but thousands of them in the game.

470
00:22:20,604 --> 00:22:23,787
So I get an email, this is 2006, from a player saying,

471
00:22:23,787 --> 00:22:27,951
the following mistakes in the game

472
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:30,233
makes your shit game totally unplayable.

473
00:22:30,233 --> 00:22:34,476
And there's a list of things, no bugs listed at all.

474
00:22:35,662 --> 00:22:39,825
Things like, German felt howitz cannon, nine centimeters.

475
00:22:39,825 --> 00:22:43,028
You say deployed February 43.

476
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,709
True date, March 2, 43.

477
00:22:44,709 --> 00:22:46,991
Stuff like that.

478
00:22:46,991 --> 00:22:52,796
And it's great, because they really help us by doing that.

479
00:22:52,796 --> 00:22:56,059
So I just sent an email back saying, wow, that's great.

480
00:22:56,059 --> 00:22:58,300
Here you get some download codes for helping us out.

481
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,662
And he replied, oh, that's good.

482
00:23:00,662 --> 00:23:01,023
Thank you.

483
00:23:02,349 --> 00:23:05,470
So by nerding out and by creating

484
00:23:05,470 --> 00:23:08,130
these high engagement subject matters,

485
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:10,071
people will engage even more in your game.

486
00:23:10,071 --> 00:23:11,071
We think, at least.

487
00:23:11,071 --> 00:23:12,211
These are ours.

488
00:23:12,211 --> 00:23:14,872
The switching cost from the game is higher.

489
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:17,773
So it's harder for a player to switch to another game that

490
00:23:17,773 --> 00:23:19,993
is made by a competitor if they're not making

491
00:23:19,993 --> 00:23:22,334
the exact same game as a copy.

492
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:25,014
It's also rich on materials.

493
00:23:25,014 --> 00:23:27,895
So it's really easy to find new material for the game

494
00:23:27,895 --> 00:23:28,635
that you're creating.

495
00:23:28,635 --> 00:23:31,376
So you're not having to make up new things or new IP.

496
00:23:32,888 --> 00:23:35,431
You already have an existing audience or a fan base

497
00:23:35,431 --> 00:23:36,592
in that space.

498
00:23:36,592 --> 00:23:39,636
And obviously, you can find a lot of tie-ins as well.

499
00:23:39,636 --> 00:23:43,740
So this is my proudest moment of this presentation of CEO art.

500
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:46,343
Look at all the imperfections right there.

501
00:23:46,343 --> 00:23:49,807
This is the full slide if you want to take a picture of that.

502
00:23:51,898 --> 00:23:55,761
And I'll move on in three, two, one.

503
00:23:55,761 --> 00:23:57,123
Here we go.

504
00:23:57,123 --> 00:24:00,685
So why we move over to the business stuff.

505
00:24:00,685 --> 00:24:03,187
That was the game stuff, how we make games at Paradox

506
00:24:03,187 --> 00:24:04,768
from a business angle still.

507
00:24:04,768 --> 00:24:07,691
I have some Paradox developers in the audience,

508
00:24:07,691 --> 00:24:09,312
and they would tell you a totally different story

509
00:24:09,312 --> 00:24:09,972
than this one.

510
00:24:10,697 --> 00:24:11,397
how we make a game.

511
00:24:11,397 --> 00:24:13,338
This is my perspective, on the business side.

512
00:24:13,338 --> 00:24:15,559
So why do you want to make a business model?

513
00:24:15,559 --> 00:24:17,720
Why do you want to visualize to people

514
00:24:17,720 --> 00:24:19,520
how the business model looks

515
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,081
and what you're trying to do with your business model?

516
00:24:22,081 --> 00:24:24,182
First of all, it's a naming convention.

517
00:24:24,182 --> 00:24:29,144
If you use the same words for the same things,

518
00:24:29,144 --> 00:24:32,605
you will work in the same direction.

519
00:24:32,605 --> 00:24:36,907
So, in our case, is Steam a partner or a channel?

520
00:24:38,089 --> 00:24:41,672
It's really important because if we have the words just wrong,

521
00:24:41,672 --> 00:24:47,338
we might just misunderstand what we're doing.

522
00:24:47,338 --> 00:24:49,440
The other thing is that, is there actually

523
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,203
a receiver on the other end for this product?

524
00:24:52,203 --> 00:24:54,165
Once you start analyzing the business model

525
00:24:54,165 --> 00:24:56,628
and dig deep, which we're going to do in a moment,

526
00:24:56,628 --> 00:24:58,950
you will see, is there really someone who's

527
00:24:58,950 --> 00:25:00,051
interested in playing this game?

528
00:25:03,260 --> 00:25:05,342
It helps you to focus a lot as well.

529
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:09,185
If you visualize the whole business model on a big screen

530
00:25:09,185 --> 00:25:13,689
like this, you will see quite clearly what do we need to

531
00:25:13,689 --> 00:25:15,911
focus on to make this a big success.

532
00:25:15,911 --> 00:25:21,436
And the fourth one is that it encourages use of data.

533
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:24,279
Because once you start talking about business models, you

534
00:25:24,279 --> 00:25:27,602
will figure out that some people only have opinions.

535
00:25:27,602 --> 00:25:29,484
It's my opinion that.

536
00:25:30,462 --> 00:25:34,865
I actually banned that word from our management meeting.

537
00:25:34,865 --> 00:25:36,566
I said, you can't have an opinion,

538
00:25:36,566 --> 00:25:38,247
because it's worth shit.

539
00:25:38,247 --> 00:25:39,608
You can have a thesis.

540
00:25:39,608 --> 00:25:42,590
My thesis is that the things are like this.

541
00:25:42,590 --> 00:25:43,210
Opinions, no.

542
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:43,990
Thesis, OK.

543
00:25:43,990 --> 00:25:49,153
If you have data, you can say, the data backs up,

544
00:25:49,153 --> 00:25:51,875
and I base my thesis on this data.

545
00:25:51,875 --> 00:25:54,737
But maybe your thesis is wrong, so the data

546
00:25:54,737 --> 00:25:56,278
is showing something else.

547
00:25:56,278 --> 00:25:58,459
That's also how you put it, the naming convention.

548
00:25:59,845 --> 00:26:00,345
No opinions.

549
00:26:00,345 --> 00:26:05,651
Then we make what we call a business model assessment.

550
00:26:05,651 --> 00:26:09,315
We ask ourselves seven simple questions about the game

551
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:10,756
that we're about to look at.

552
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:16,882
The first is the product switching cost.

553
00:26:16,882 --> 00:26:19,345
How much does it cost for a customer

554
00:26:19,345 --> 00:26:22,428
to switch from your product to a competitive product?

555
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:28,043
How much emotional investment, financial investment,

556
00:26:28,043 --> 00:26:31,103
forum time investment, and other relationship

557
00:26:31,103 --> 00:26:35,484
has a person actually invested in this game?

558
00:26:35,484 --> 00:26:37,825
And how easily would they switch to another game?

559
00:26:37,825 --> 00:26:40,205
How do we have to screw up for the people

560
00:26:40,205 --> 00:26:41,866
to actually leave us and never come back?

561
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,146
That's the first one.

562
00:26:44,146 --> 00:26:46,226
The second one is.

563
00:26:46,966 --> 00:26:50,168
what's the potential for recurring revenue in this game?

564
00:26:50,168 --> 00:26:52,729
It has a lot to do with the core pillars that I just presented,

565
00:26:52,729 --> 00:26:54,030
like the replayability.

566
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,630
If the replayability is high,

567
00:26:55,630 --> 00:26:59,532
the recurring revenue potential is much higher, for example.

568
00:26:59,532 --> 00:27:01,173
Earning versus spending.

569
00:27:01,173 --> 00:27:06,095
Do you make money early in the process,

570
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,797
for example, through a Kickstarter?

571
00:27:08,797 --> 00:27:12,179
Or do you make money after the game is released?

572
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:14,520
How does that look?

573
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:15,780
It's a risk assessment.

574
00:27:18,427 --> 00:27:21,649
Do we as a company have a game-changing cost structure?

575
00:27:21,649 --> 00:27:23,630
If we compare to our competitors,

576
00:27:23,630 --> 00:27:25,011
how large teams do they have?

577
00:27:25,011 --> 00:27:26,652
What's their marketing budget?

578
00:27:26,652 --> 00:27:28,333
How do we spend our money?

579
00:27:28,333 --> 00:27:31,234
Are we smarter with our money than our competitors are,

580
00:27:31,234 --> 00:27:33,215
but we can still keep the same quality?

581
00:27:33,215 --> 00:27:39,219
To what extent do other people or are other people

582
00:27:39,219 --> 00:27:42,841
allowed to add value to our games?

583
00:27:42,841 --> 00:27:44,201
Modders, for example?

584
00:27:44,201 --> 00:27:45,422
YouTubers?

585
00:27:45,422 --> 00:27:48,123
So how do you make other people do the work for you?

586
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:51,311
It's also a cost issue to some part,

587
00:27:51,311 --> 00:27:55,153
because if you have 1,000 YouTubers creating videos

588
00:27:55,153 --> 00:27:57,735
for you, you don't need a marketing department.

589
00:27:57,735 --> 00:27:59,896
Or maybe you need a marketing department,

590
00:27:59,896 --> 00:28:02,918
because you can get up to 2,000 YouTubers next week.

591
00:28:02,918 --> 00:28:04,559
So to what extent do others do the work?

592
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,402
And the final one is, how scalable is the product?

593
00:28:08,402 --> 00:28:11,264
And by scalable, it's a buzzword here in San Francisco

594
00:28:11,264 --> 00:28:13,085
specifically, but all over the world.

595
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:18,311
Scalable basically means, can I sell one more product

596
00:28:18,311 --> 00:28:19,972
without adding any extra staff?

597
00:28:19,972 --> 00:28:22,433
How scalable is the business model?

598
00:28:22,433 --> 00:28:29,397
And the final one, how protected are we

599
00:28:29,397 --> 00:28:30,237
against our competition?

600
00:28:30,237 --> 00:28:31,638
Is it easy to like, how do we see that,

601
00:28:31,638 --> 00:28:33,879
the protection against competition?

602
00:28:36,168 --> 00:28:38,329
These seven, we rate them from 1 to 10,

603
00:28:38,329 --> 00:28:40,971
and then we try to see how can we actually

604
00:28:40,971 --> 00:28:43,232
make this even better?

605
00:28:43,232 --> 00:28:45,593
And how do we integrate that in the game design?

606
00:28:45,593 --> 00:28:47,954
We make the assessment sheet, and we apply it

607
00:28:47,954 --> 00:28:50,475
on the game design sheet and see, wait,

608
00:28:50,475 --> 00:28:51,876
can we do something here?

609
00:28:51,876 --> 00:28:55,137
Is there a potential to do any of these seven a lot better?

610
00:29:00,665 --> 00:29:05,447
Which brings us to the whole visualization of what a business model looks like.

611
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:08,269
How many people recognize this model?

612
00:29:08,269 --> 00:29:09,610
Yeah, quite a few are working with it, that's good.

613
00:29:12,815 --> 00:29:14,575
What I want to say, if you start in the middle there,

614
00:29:14,575 --> 00:29:18,336
those of you who know it, maybe know it as good as I do,

615
00:29:18,336 --> 00:29:20,757
but the value proposition is the number of,

616
00:29:20,757 --> 00:29:23,557
this is available online, it's called the Business Model

617
00:29:23,557 --> 00:29:25,878
Canvas by a company called Strategizer.

618
00:29:25,878 --> 00:29:29,519
I've been to a few workshops on that, and I'm still a novice,

619
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:30,719
but we're trying to get there.

620
00:29:30,719 --> 00:29:35,320
So the value proposition is the sum of products and services

621
00:29:35,320 --> 00:29:37,200
that your company provides for a customer.

622
00:29:38,913 --> 00:29:42,635
They are being sold through channels, as you see there,

623
00:29:42,635 --> 00:29:43,996
to the customer segments.

624
00:29:43,996 --> 00:29:47,618
And the customer relationships is

625
00:29:47,618 --> 00:29:51,241
how you approach your customer in terms of communication.

626
00:29:51,241 --> 00:29:55,704
Email, social channels, direct phone calls, hopefully not,

627
00:29:55,704 --> 00:29:56,304
but still.

628
00:29:56,304 --> 00:30:02,488
And down there to the left, to the right, is the revenue.

629
00:30:02,488 --> 00:30:03,909
How do we actually make money here?

630
00:30:05,066 --> 00:30:07,708
On the other side is key resources.

631
00:30:07,708 --> 00:30:11,891
What do we actually need to make this product or value

632
00:30:11,891 --> 00:30:13,052
proposition a reality?

633
00:30:13,052 --> 00:30:16,615
Programmers, artists in our business, for example, game

634
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:20,518
designers, and the key activities we need to engage

635
00:30:20,518 --> 00:30:22,319
in to make this value proposition happen.

636
00:30:22,319 --> 00:30:26,262
And what partners do we need to actually carry this through?

637
00:30:26,262 --> 00:30:28,885
On that side, it sums up the cost structure.

638
00:30:28,885 --> 00:30:33,548
And if the revenue are higher than the costs, it's a

639
00:30:33,548 --> 00:30:34,409
profitable product.

640
00:30:35,062 --> 00:30:36,803
Very simple way to put it.

641
00:30:36,803 --> 00:30:38,844
So we work a lot with this model.

642
00:30:38,844 --> 00:30:43,627
Just placing Post-its on this business model canvas,

643
00:30:43,627 --> 00:30:44,687
moving them around.

644
00:30:44,687 --> 00:30:49,530
And you will have to, all the time,

645
00:30:49,530 --> 00:30:51,831
to invent your business model.

646
00:30:51,831 --> 00:30:54,893
Because there's something called the Icarus paradox.

647
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:58,535
And it means that you're a victim of your own success.

648
00:30:58,535 --> 00:31:01,677
So once you've succeeded big time with something,

649
00:31:03,288 --> 00:31:05,429
and you don't change it over time,

650
00:31:05,429 --> 00:31:09,332
the customers will feel that they own this game more than you do.

651
00:31:09,332 --> 00:31:12,054
So you will get your core audience to turn on you

652
00:31:12,054 --> 00:31:15,736
once you start changing things in the business model.

653
00:31:15,736 --> 00:31:18,378
A company is only in one of two stages.

654
00:31:18,378 --> 00:31:20,820
One is development and the other is stagnation.

655
00:31:20,820 --> 00:31:24,482
So once you reach your peak on your business model,

656
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:26,283
you'll start to stagnate if you don't innovate.

657
00:31:28,085 --> 00:31:30,306
There are a lot of companies out there in our business who

658
00:31:30,306 --> 00:31:31,206
does not innovate.

659
00:31:31,206 --> 00:31:33,247
I'm not going to name any of those, because I'll probably

660
00:31:33,247 --> 00:31:34,127
be sued.

661
00:31:34,127 --> 00:31:36,608
But I'll name a few companies who are really good at

662
00:31:36,608 --> 00:31:37,588
inventing this.

663
00:31:37,588 --> 00:31:39,229
Look at Blizzard, for example.

664
00:31:39,229 --> 00:31:44,471
They released World of Warcraft with a $15 recurring

665
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:45,131
revenue every month.

666
00:31:45,131 --> 00:31:49,813
And they kind of realized this business model is growing old.

667
00:31:49,813 --> 00:31:51,514
So what did they do?

668
00:31:51,514 --> 00:31:56,075
Invented Hearthstone, which has a better scalability, high

669
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,576
switching cost, everything.

670
00:31:58,601 --> 00:32:03,005
It's even better if you take the business model assessment

671
00:32:03,005 --> 00:32:03,746
that I just showed.

672
00:32:03,746 --> 00:32:06,088
Hearthstone is even better than World of Warcraft.

673
00:32:06,088 --> 00:32:09,050
And World of Warcraft is a really strong one.

674
00:32:09,050 --> 00:32:11,432
So Blizzard is one of those companies that are always

675
00:32:11,432 --> 00:32:13,434
inventing their business models as well.

676
00:32:13,434 --> 00:32:16,457
So by making Hearthstone, which is totally different from

677
00:32:16,457 --> 00:32:19,139
World of Warcraft, they don't really need the customer

678
00:32:19,139 --> 00:32:20,320
approval in the same way.

679
00:32:21,557 --> 00:32:25,901
So if you're only working on one game, and you work on the same business model all the time,

680
00:32:25,901 --> 00:32:28,604
the customers will have their say all the time.

681
00:32:28,604 --> 00:32:32,748
And if you do something too strange or too weird, they will turn on you,

682
00:32:32,748 --> 00:32:36,852
and tell you you can't do that, and you'll have to back up like 50 steps again and start over.

683
00:32:36,852 --> 00:32:40,516
With a slightly damaged reputation as well.

684
00:32:40,516 --> 00:32:40,556
So...

685
00:32:44,858 --> 00:32:46,919
When you design business models, it's

686
00:32:46,919 --> 00:32:50,321
interesting that you don't need to talk about business models.

687
00:32:50,321 --> 00:32:53,402
You can talk product, you can talk model,

688
00:32:53,402 --> 00:32:56,083
and you can mix and match the teams.

689
00:32:56,083 --> 00:32:59,284
When you talk about the business model at the abstract level

690
00:32:59,284 --> 00:33:00,765
that this is, the former screen.

691
00:33:03,596 --> 00:33:08,299
you can have people from marketing discussing a game product because it's so abstract

692
00:33:08,299 --> 00:33:12,821
and then they can take it back to the team, like what are the overarching goals

693
00:33:12,821 --> 00:33:17,944
rather than what is the actual game design and they could take out the different parts

694
00:33:17,944 --> 00:33:21,487
of the business model, give it to the people in different departments and let

695
00:33:21,487 --> 00:33:26,650
they do the interpretation work but you've agreed on the overarching goals.

696
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:30,098
You can work a lot with constrained creativity,

697
00:33:30,098 --> 00:33:32,379
that you box in things and say,

698
00:33:32,379 --> 00:33:35,121
we will start only in this part of the business model canvas

699
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,002
and work from there.

700
00:33:36,002 --> 00:33:38,984
If you take, for example,

701
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:42,226
six pieces of H-stud Lego, like this one,

702
00:33:42,226 --> 00:33:45,709
six pieces of that, and combine them, for example,

703
00:33:45,709 --> 00:33:47,910
you can only combine these six pieces.

704
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:51,833
How many ways can you combine them?

705
00:33:51,833 --> 00:33:54,615
It turns out it's 915 million different combinations.

706
00:33:55,876 --> 00:33:56,716
That's pretty cool.

707
00:33:56,716 --> 00:33:59,497
Like, you would say, oh, I can only work with these six studs.

708
00:33:59,497 --> 00:34:00,237
That's impossible.

709
00:34:00,237 --> 00:34:01,337
No, you can do a lot.

710
00:34:01,337 --> 00:34:05,018
So if you go back, if I go back to the former one here,

711
00:34:05,018 --> 00:34:09,879
you can start in any of these squares right here

712
00:34:09,879 --> 00:34:12,440
and start working on a business model or on a game.

713
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:16,701
Say that you start in revenue streams and say,

714
00:34:16,701 --> 00:34:20,842
let's make a game where we have to charge $10 a month

715
00:34:20,842 --> 00:34:23,583
for people to play it.

716
00:34:23,583 --> 00:34:24,323
How would that look?

717
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,799
How do we fill the other parts of this,

718
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:29,400
and how do we write the game design based on this business

719
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:29,760
model canvas?

720
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,201
Or you can start in the customer signals.

721
00:34:32,201 --> 00:34:34,122
You can start in the channels.

722
00:34:34,122 --> 00:34:38,144
It doesn't matter, as long as you do new things and innovate.

723
00:34:38,144 --> 00:34:40,885
And the most important thing is not

724
00:34:40,885 --> 00:34:42,706
to make new projects based on this.

725
00:34:42,706 --> 00:34:45,628
It's more of a thought process.

726
00:34:45,628 --> 00:34:47,889
It's more getting people to think this way,

727
00:34:47,889 --> 00:34:51,070
the way they approach problems.

728
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:51,270
I'll move on.

729
00:34:52,501 --> 00:34:58,865
Which moves us to when you take out the value proposition and the customer segments out of this equation,

730
00:34:58,865 --> 00:35:01,947
you get the value proposition canvas. This is also available online.

731
00:35:01,947 --> 00:35:07,631
And the model with a little head there, it says customer jobs.

732
00:35:07,631 --> 00:35:11,513
So when a customer picks up your product,

733
00:35:11,513 --> 00:35:17,957
what are their expectations that the job to be done for them is fulfilled?

734
00:35:18,642 --> 00:35:22,743
If you take a drill, for example, if you buy a drill, that's a very good hardware tool.

735
00:35:22,743 --> 00:35:25,804
What are you actually paying for?

736
00:35:25,804 --> 00:35:30,626
If you're a Marxist, you would say you're paying for the plastic,

737
00:35:30,626 --> 00:35:33,567
you're paying for the iron,

738
00:35:33,567 --> 00:35:37,728
and you're paying for the transportation of the product to the hardware store.

739
00:35:37,728 --> 00:35:40,749
But what are you actually paying for?

740
00:35:40,749 --> 00:35:44,950
You're paying because you want the hole in the wall in your house or apartment.

741
00:35:45,556 --> 00:35:46,637
Nothing else.

742
00:35:46,637 --> 00:35:48,618
It's a customer job that needs to be fulfilled.

743
00:35:48,618 --> 00:35:53,361
There are two other things here on the customer side.

744
00:35:53,361 --> 00:35:54,382
One is pains.

745
00:35:54,382 --> 00:35:57,444
What is the potential pain that people will feel

746
00:35:57,444 --> 00:36:00,266
when they buy this product?

747
00:36:00,266 --> 00:36:03,248
What are their worst fears when they look at your product

748
00:36:03,248 --> 00:36:04,288
and they're about to buy it?

749
00:36:04,288 --> 00:36:08,171
And the gains, what are they hoping

750
00:36:08,171 --> 00:36:12,253
to achieve that is even more good, like good side effects,

751
00:36:12,253 --> 00:36:13,074
by having your product?

752
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:18,475
And on the left side here is how do you actually make a

753
00:36:18,475 --> 00:36:22,258
product that matches the jobs, how do you relief the pains

754
00:36:22,258 --> 00:36:25,260
from the customers, and how do you enhance the gains.

755
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:28,882
So now I'm going to show you the value proposition we did

756
00:36:28,882 --> 00:36:29,823
for Europa Universalis 4.

757
00:36:29,823 --> 00:36:30,163
You ready?

758
00:36:30,163 --> 00:36:36,708
So on the right-hand side there, let's start with the

759
00:36:36,708 --> 00:36:39,510
customer jobs.

760
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:41,671
One of them is feel smart.

761
00:36:42,179 --> 00:36:44,620
People want to feel smart.

762
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:47,081
They want to also be challenged, strategy gaming-wise.

763
00:36:47,081 --> 00:36:50,062
You could make a mod, for example.

764
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:51,163
It's good.

765
00:36:51,163 --> 00:36:55,305
Typically, you could take this down to three to five different

766
00:36:55,305 --> 00:36:56,105
in each square.

767
00:36:56,105 --> 00:36:58,046
It makes it easier to look at.

768
00:36:58,046 --> 00:37:01,287
If you take the pains, for example,

769
00:37:01,287 --> 00:37:03,988
one of the apparent pains we've seen with our games

770
00:37:03,988 --> 00:37:09,070
is I'm not sure I'm going to be smart enough to play this game.

771
00:37:09,070 --> 00:37:11,071
I'm not sure that I will actually understand

772
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:11,772
how to play this game.

773
00:37:12,715 --> 00:37:15,777
And a few of the gains are like I can engage in a great

774
00:37:15,777 --> 00:37:17,878
forum, for example.

775
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:20,179
I'm a part of a big community that has a lot of fun together.

776
00:37:20,179 --> 00:37:24,541
And if you match that on the other side, one of the pain

777
00:37:24,541 --> 00:37:27,842
relievers we have to do is how do we make a good tutorial?

778
00:37:27,842 --> 00:37:30,804
How do we make it easy for people to come into the game?

779
00:37:30,804 --> 00:37:32,465
YouTube videos, for example, interactive

780
00:37:32,465 --> 00:37:34,446
tutorials, part of that.

781
00:37:34,446 --> 00:37:37,567
The gain enhancers, like how do we make it even easier to

782
00:37:37,567 --> 00:37:40,348
contribute to our forums and to sign in and to be a part of

783
00:37:40,348 --> 00:37:41,829
it on the gain enhancer side.

784
00:37:42,969 --> 00:37:45,850
And the product is obviously your Open Universalist 4.

785
00:37:45,850 --> 00:37:50,371
So this is a way of toying with your own ideas and

786
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:53,012
getting quantitative and feedback from

787
00:37:53,012 --> 00:37:53,973
the community as well.

788
00:37:53,973 --> 00:37:55,553
You can read what people are actually

789
00:37:55,553 --> 00:37:56,854
writing about your game.

790
00:37:56,854 --> 00:38:00,515
Media, for example, Steam reviews, and put them here.

791
00:38:00,515 --> 00:38:04,456
We see that 50% of everyone is saying that the character

792
00:38:04,456 --> 00:38:05,916
creation is not deep enough.

793
00:38:05,916 --> 00:38:07,277
Do we agree with that?

794
00:38:07,277 --> 00:38:08,897
And how do we sort it out if that's so

795
00:38:08,897 --> 00:38:10,038
important to our clients?

796
00:38:12,685 --> 00:38:13,265
Great.

797
00:38:13,265 --> 00:38:17,549
I'm going to have one more management models.

798
00:38:17,549 --> 00:38:20,271
I'm not a big fan of these management literature books.

799
00:38:20,271 --> 00:38:23,474
They're just going to change everything forever.

800
00:38:23,474 --> 00:38:25,836
So blue ocean strategy, how many are familiar with that?

801
00:38:27,070 --> 00:38:31,571
Right? Blue ocean basically means that you should move out of the competitive space

802
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:34,652
and move into space where there's no competition.

803
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:37,953
And you do it by four simplified steps.

804
00:38:37,953 --> 00:38:40,814
And we did this for City Skylines straight off.

805
00:38:40,814 --> 00:38:42,395
And I'm going to tell you exactly how we did it.

806
00:38:42,395 --> 00:38:45,416
So it consists of four building blocks.

807
00:38:45,416 --> 00:38:47,737
I'm going to check the time, sorry.

808
00:38:47,737 --> 00:38:51,898
Four building blocks, which is...

809
00:38:51,898 --> 00:38:52,418
First of all...

810
00:38:53,660 --> 00:38:57,542
What features do our competitors have, in this case,

811
00:38:57,542 --> 00:39:02,143
SimCity 5, that we can eliminate completely from our product?

812
00:39:02,143 --> 00:39:04,824
And that is costly for them to create as well.

813
00:39:04,824 --> 00:39:07,005
So we save money and take away a feature.

814
00:39:07,005 --> 00:39:10,906
In our case, it was that the game was always online.

815
00:39:10,906 --> 00:39:13,547
They put a lot of money into making it always online.

816
00:39:13,547 --> 00:39:14,007
And we said,

817
00:39:15,202 --> 00:39:16,943
What would be the reasoning?

818
00:39:16,943 --> 00:39:19,865
If you're making a customer job out of this, what's the

819
00:39:19,865 --> 00:39:22,047
reasoning of always being online?

820
00:39:22,047 --> 00:39:22,947
We don't think there is one.

821
00:39:22,947 --> 00:39:26,170
We think what they looked at was the value for EA to be

822
00:39:26,170 --> 00:39:26,910
always online.

823
00:39:26,910 --> 00:39:29,272
They probably wanted to track the customers and

824
00:39:29,272 --> 00:39:30,293
see what they did.

825
00:39:30,293 --> 00:39:32,334
So we said, OK, we also want to track what our customers

826
00:39:32,334 --> 00:39:33,875
are doing in the game.

827
00:39:33,875 --> 00:39:36,878
Can we do that without being always online?

828
00:39:36,878 --> 00:39:37,898
The answer was yes.

829
00:39:37,898 --> 00:39:38,219
So good.

830
00:39:38,219 --> 00:39:40,720
Out the door.

831
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,261
Simple as that.

832
00:39:42,835 --> 00:39:43,916
Reduce.

833
00:39:43,916 --> 00:39:48,218
What features do we think we can reduce to such a limit

834
00:39:48,218 --> 00:39:51,019
that we save a lot of money without ruining the game

835
00:39:51,019 --> 00:39:51,819
experience?

836
00:39:51,819 --> 00:39:54,920
There are a lot of examples of this in Cities Skylines,

837
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:55,781
SimCity example.

838
00:39:55,781 --> 00:39:59,582
But in this case, we had 200 buildings in our game

839
00:39:59,582 --> 00:40:01,223
when we released it.

840
00:40:01,223 --> 00:40:01,903
They had 800.

841
00:40:01,903 --> 00:40:07,025
And that's a huge budget difference.

842
00:40:07,025 --> 00:40:08,726
Create.

843
00:40:08,726 --> 00:40:10,627
What features can we add?

844
00:40:11,176 --> 00:40:13,597
that is of high value to the customers,

845
00:40:13,597 --> 00:40:15,457
but is not present in the current product.

846
00:40:15,457 --> 00:40:18,618
For us, it was, for example, modding.

847
00:40:18,618 --> 00:40:22,059
We knew that the SimCity modding group

848
00:40:22,059 --> 00:40:24,240
were desperate to have a game with modding in it,

849
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:25,020
a modern city builder.

850
00:40:25,020 --> 00:40:28,401
That also took care of the problem

851
00:40:28,401 --> 00:40:30,442
that we had fewer buildings.

852
00:40:30,442 --> 00:40:35,163
In 24 hours, we had more than 2,000 mods for Cities Guide.

853
00:40:35,163 --> 00:40:35,363
So ta-da!

854
00:40:35,363 --> 00:40:36,264
Right?

855
00:40:36,264 --> 00:40:39,385
Took care of the problem.

856
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:44,773
And what factors should be raised above industry standard?

857
00:40:44,773 --> 00:40:46,735
We don't need to outdo them totally,

858
00:40:46,735 --> 00:40:50,037
so we put a lot of effort into the management layer of it.

859
00:40:50,037 --> 00:40:51,518
We said, people want to play.

860
00:40:51,518 --> 00:40:55,401
They don't want every individual simulated

861
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:56,902
because it's really costly.

862
00:40:56,902 --> 00:40:59,123
So we'll put a management layer on it.

863
00:41:00,011 --> 00:41:03,934
and more abstract how you actually run a city, which

864
00:41:03,934 --> 00:41:06,835
can have really interesting side effects once you start

865
00:41:06,835 --> 00:41:09,177
following individuals in Cities Skylines

866
00:41:09,177 --> 00:41:11,298
and make a lot of funny stories, which is also

867
00:41:11,298 --> 00:41:14,140
a side thing with emergent gameplay and all that.

868
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:17,202
I urge you all to see a really PC gamer article which

869
00:41:17,202 --> 00:41:22,125
is called The Cities Skylines City with Only One House,

870
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:24,587
where they try to simulate the Sims in Cities Skylines.

871
00:41:24,587 --> 00:41:26,588
It turns out very weird, I can tell you that much.

872
00:41:27,382 --> 00:41:32,143
But it's almost an extra value, because it creates new, weird,

873
00:41:32,143 --> 00:41:33,744
emergent gameplay stories as well.

874
00:41:33,744 --> 00:41:35,304
So it didn't matter to people that much.

875
00:41:35,304 --> 00:41:38,585
And if you divide this into two groups,

876
00:41:38,585 --> 00:41:41,445
it's on the cost-saving side, the red ones,

877
00:41:41,445 --> 00:41:44,226
and on the cost-increasing on the other side.

878
00:41:44,226 --> 00:41:46,266
And you have to balance this in a very good way.

879
00:41:46,266 --> 00:41:51,427
So basically, if you walk through the process how

880
00:41:51,427 --> 00:41:54,768
we work, just recap everything I said so far.

881
00:41:54,768 --> 00:41:56,208
The product mission comes first.

882
00:41:57,303 --> 00:41:58,824
The value proposition comes second.

883
00:41:58,824 --> 00:42:03,426
And if the value proposition is not good enough, we will

884
00:42:03,426 --> 00:42:06,467
have to start over with the product vision, because maybe

885
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:09,028
they're not matching together.

886
00:42:09,028 --> 00:42:10,389
You look then at the project scope.

887
00:42:10,389 --> 00:42:12,650
Can we actually pull off the value proposition

888
00:42:12,650 --> 00:42:13,410
with this vision?

889
00:42:15,166 --> 00:42:16,407
up to the prototype phase.

890
00:42:16,407 --> 00:42:19,371
And after prototype, you're fairly sure

891
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:22,113
that the whole team understand exactly what they're supposed

892
00:42:22,113 --> 00:42:25,737
to do, the marketing angle, the sales benefits, everything.

893
00:42:25,737 --> 00:42:29,001
So everyone in the organization will be on the same page

894
00:42:29,001 --> 00:42:30,182
if it's done right.

895
00:42:30,182 --> 00:42:32,004
I'm not saying we're doing this right all the time

896
00:42:32,004 --> 00:42:34,607
because I have Paradox employees in the audience,

897
00:42:34,607 --> 00:42:35,468
but we strive to do it right.

898
00:42:36,766 --> 00:42:38,750
And if the prototype is not good enough,

899
00:42:38,750 --> 00:42:41,296
you just go back to the value proposition and say,

900
00:42:41,296 --> 00:42:43,019
can we redo the value proposition

901
00:42:43,019 --> 00:42:45,645
and see if it fits better for the next prototype?

902
00:42:45,645 --> 00:42:47,609
Is it even worth doing a new one?

903
00:42:50,924 --> 00:42:53,245
And if you take game design versus business strategy,

904
00:42:53,245 --> 00:42:55,865
because it's basically the same thing.

905
00:42:55,865 --> 00:42:58,145
Typically, when you run into a problem with a product,

906
00:42:58,145 --> 00:43:01,786
it has a business side and it has a development side.

907
00:43:01,786 --> 00:43:03,126
It's not opposite.

908
00:43:03,126 --> 00:43:04,287
It's actually the same.

909
00:43:04,287 --> 00:43:06,647
So we take the Crusader Kings 2 example.

910
00:43:06,647 --> 00:43:10,428
We have developer problems and we have business problems.

911
00:43:10,428 --> 00:43:15,229
The problem with previous versions of Crusader Kings

912
00:43:15,229 --> 00:43:18,829
was that every time we released something for it,

913
00:43:18,829 --> 00:43:20,690
it was different versions for different gamers.

914
00:43:22,261 --> 00:43:25,542
Which, on the other hand, on the business side,

915
00:43:25,542 --> 00:43:27,723
caused lower attachment rates for DLCs

916
00:43:27,723 --> 00:43:32,105
because you needed all the time to upgrade your game.

917
00:43:32,105 --> 00:43:36,087
The developer problem as well, this is actually Europa.

918
00:43:36,087 --> 00:43:39,349
Europa Universalis 3 was a game released before Crusader Kings

919
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,110
2, so all the problems come from Europa 3.

920
00:43:41,951 --> 00:43:44,957
The multiplayer support, because you have different versions,

921
00:43:44,957 --> 00:43:47,162
you couldn't have multiplayer support in a good way,

922
00:43:47,162 --> 00:43:49,146
which made the business problem that customers

923
00:43:49,146 --> 00:43:51,331
weren't satisfied because it was not

924
00:43:51,331 --> 00:43:53,275
a full and complete product in the eyes of people.

925
00:43:56,795 --> 00:44:03,600
The developer problem also, which stemmed from different versions, was that it was problems to adapt the mods to all the different versions,

926
00:44:03,600 --> 00:44:07,764
which made the business problem that you had lower engagement rates on the people there,

927
00:44:07,764 --> 00:44:13,808
because they knew that maybe I can't download this mod because I have the wrong version and whatever, I don't really care.

928
00:44:13,808 --> 00:44:19,733
So, our solution to that was actually, every time we release a DLC,

929
00:44:21,539 --> 00:44:25,200
You download the whole game, and you get 50% of it for free,

930
00:44:25,200 --> 00:44:26,381
and the rest you unlock.

931
00:44:26,381 --> 00:44:29,423
But all the content is in there, so everyone is basically

932
00:44:29,423 --> 00:44:31,204
playing the same version.

933
00:44:31,204 --> 00:44:35,866
So what seems like a really simple solution actually

934
00:44:35,866 --> 00:44:38,567
took a lot of thinking, because both these things

935
00:44:38,567 --> 00:44:40,248
had to match in together.

936
00:44:40,248 --> 00:44:42,649
If this was only something that would

937
00:44:42,649 --> 00:44:44,630
have been solved from a development standpoint,

938
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,712
I'm not sure that we would actually sort out

939
00:44:46,712 --> 00:44:47,832
the business problems.

940
00:44:49,023 --> 00:44:51,804
We could have found something completely different that

941
00:44:51,804 --> 00:44:54,486
took care of the developer problem,

942
00:44:54,486 --> 00:44:58,007
but what didn't make sense business-wise.

943
00:44:58,007 --> 00:44:59,828
Which takes me to the final part, which

944
00:44:59,828 --> 00:45:02,990
is the value creation part.

945
00:45:02,990 --> 00:45:05,611
And we have coined an expression that we call games

946
00:45:05,611 --> 00:45:07,532
as a platform on the value creation side.

947
00:45:07,532 --> 00:45:13,115
And value creation-wise is a gaming ecosystem

948
00:45:13,115 --> 00:45:15,776
created by you that continues to grow

949
00:45:15,776 --> 00:45:17,597
without your own involvement.

950
00:45:18,205 --> 00:45:20,947
So basically, it's a self-serving system of gamers.

951
00:45:20,947 --> 00:45:26,092
Team Fortress 2 is the best example in the world of this.

952
00:45:26,092 --> 00:45:29,696
So when you talk about value creation,

953
00:45:29,696 --> 00:45:32,478
like, who is actually creating value in this process?

954
00:45:32,478 --> 00:45:37,643
And what are the two key rules

955
00:45:37,643 --> 00:45:39,825
for how you make it possible for people

956
00:45:39,825 --> 00:45:41,107
to create value for your game?

957
00:45:42,982 --> 00:45:46,263
First one is, if you make it easy for people to create

958
00:45:46,263 --> 00:45:49,423
value, for example, mods, you're on the winning side of

959
00:45:49,423 --> 00:45:50,284
the games industry.

960
00:45:50,284 --> 00:45:54,945
If you make it hard, if you lock people out, you're on the

961
00:45:54,945 --> 00:45:57,766
losing side.

962
00:45:57,766 --> 00:46:03,428
If watching a YouTube video of your game adds value to the

963
00:46:03,428 --> 00:46:07,469
gamer rather than spoils the whole game, you're on the

964
00:46:07,469 --> 00:46:08,289
winning side of gaming.

965
00:46:09,506 --> 00:46:12,888
Those are the two golden rules of value creation

966
00:46:12,888 --> 00:46:20,312
and how your game is created and how it affects your game design.

967
00:46:20,312 --> 00:46:22,033
So it's not only about creating the value

968
00:46:22,033 --> 00:46:26,796
and how do you actually attract the people who create the value.

969
00:46:26,796 --> 00:46:27,336
Simple.

970
00:46:27,336 --> 00:46:32,599
First, lots of replayability, a lot of good mod support,

971
00:46:32,599 --> 00:46:34,080
dedicated people who take care of that.

972
00:46:34,567 --> 00:46:39,694
a YouTube friendliness. We talk a lot about what's the YouTube moment of this game.

973
00:46:39,694 --> 00:46:46,183
Like, why does someone finally, or just all of a sudden on YouTube, cry out in like laughter or

974
00:46:46,183 --> 00:46:50,929
something like that? What happens in the game when that happens on YouTube? Because that is what

975
00:46:50,929 --> 00:46:52,491
people are actually watching on YouTube.

976
00:46:54,438 --> 00:46:56,539
Also, a game that creates stories,

977
00:46:56,539 --> 00:46:59,260
so you will tell your friends what happened in the game,

978
00:46:59,260 --> 00:47:02,642
and you will be intrigued to create more things that

979
00:47:02,642 --> 00:47:04,262
are happening and engaging in the game.

980
00:47:04,262 --> 00:47:08,444
And the most important factor of all,

981
00:47:08,444 --> 00:47:11,185
let the people who create value in your game

982
00:47:11,185 --> 00:47:13,046
also make money from it.

983
00:47:13,046 --> 00:47:14,367
You can split it up in between you,

984
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:16,048
because after all, it's your game,

985
00:47:16,048 --> 00:47:18,229
so you should have some of the money.

986
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:20,890
But there are companies who are blocking people

987
00:47:20,890 --> 00:47:22,751
from putting up YouTube videos as well.

988
00:47:22,751 --> 00:47:23,231
Don't do that.

989
00:47:24,657 --> 00:47:25,137
suicide.

990
00:47:25,137 --> 00:47:29,140
That was my walkthrough for today.

991
00:47:29,140 --> 00:47:30,962
I just want to summarize everything I said.

992
00:47:30,962 --> 00:47:32,583
I wanted three hours here, because I

993
00:47:32,583 --> 00:47:34,485
wanted to go deeper in on everything like this.

994
00:47:34,485 --> 00:47:36,907
But I'll summarize everything we have here

995
00:47:36,907 --> 00:47:38,008
in a few bullet points.

996
00:47:38,008 --> 00:47:41,851
And I'd be happy to answer any questions if you have any.

997
00:47:41,851 --> 00:47:44,833
So the first thing is, choose and set

998
00:47:44,833 --> 00:47:45,894
the vision for your game.

999
00:47:45,894 --> 00:47:48,716
And don't set a bad vision, like we're

1000
00:47:48,716 --> 00:47:50,398
going to create the best RTS ever,

1001
00:47:50,398 --> 00:47:52,099
because it's a crappy vision.

1002
00:47:53,206 --> 00:47:54,286
It's really bad.

1003
00:47:54,286 --> 00:47:57,747
And a bad vision is actually worse than no vision at all.

1004
00:47:57,747 --> 00:48:02,829
So if you don't feel that, you should read an article saying,

1005
00:48:02,829 --> 00:48:07,470
that's named, How to Write a Mission Statement That

1006
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,030
Doesn't Suck.

1007
00:48:08,030 --> 00:48:09,731
It's a great article.

1008
00:48:09,731 --> 00:48:12,191
And it says everything you need to know

1009
00:48:12,191 --> 00:48:14,692
how to write mission and vision statements.

1010
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,212
And it's really hard to do this.

1011
00:48:16,212 --> 00:48:17,453
And it's really frustrating.

1012
00:48:17,453 --> 00:48:19,493
But it needs to be done.

1013
00:48:21,190 --> 00:48:24,131
Start thinking about how do we, at our company,

1014
00:48:24,131 --> 00:48:26,953
integrate the business design with the game design.

1015
00:48:26,953 --> 00:48:28,513
How do they affect each other?

1016
00:48:28,513 --> 00:48:30,154
What are the synergies?

1017
00:48:30,154 --> 00:48:33,796
And what are the points where we don't really agree,

1018
00:48:33,796 --> 00:48:37,418
and we have to choose in between which thing is the right way

1019
00:48:37,418 --> 00:48:38,198
to go?

1020
00:48:38,198 --> 00:48:42,380
Start including, if you don't already do that.

1021
00:48:42,380 --> 00:48:44,662
Include the value creators, because they

1022
00:48:44,662 --> 00:48:45,662
are your best friends.

1023
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:50,219
Make your game live forever.

1024
00:48:50,219 --> 00:48:52,581
If you take those three above, it

1025
00:48:52,581 --> 00:48:53,961
will live for at least 10 years.

1026
00:48:53,961 --> 00:48:57,143
And the most important thing in our business, my closing words,

1027
00:48:57,143 --> 00:48:58,704
is to have a lot of fun.

1028
00:48:58,704 --> 00:49:00,686
Because if you don't, it will show in the game,

1029
00:49:00,686 --> 00:49:01,726
and no one will want to play it.

1030
00:49:01,726 --> 00:49:02,087
Thanks.

1031
00:49:02,087 --> 00:49:03,327
Thank you.

1032
00:49:03,327 --> 00:49:04,048
Thank you again, Kairon.

1033
00:49:04,048 --> 00:49:04,168
Thanks.

1034
00:49:04,168 --> 00:49:05,029
Thank you, everyone.

1035
00:49:05,029 --> 00:49:05,989
Thank you for coming to this talk.

1036
00:49:05,989 --> 00:49:06,890
Hope we'll see you at the end of the year.

1037
00:49:06,890 --> 00:49:07,170
Thanks a lot.

1038
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:07,390
Thanks.

1039
00:49:07,390 --> 00:49:07,550
Thanks.

1040
00:49:07,550 --> 00:49:07,690
Cheers.

1041
00:49:07,690 --> 00:49:07,930
Cheers.

1042
00:49:07,930 --> 00:49:08,131
Cheers.

1043
00:49:08,131 --> 00:49:08,331
Cheers.

1044
00:49:08,331 --> 00:49:08,451
Cheers.

1045
00:49:08,451 --> 00:49:08,591
Cheers.

1046
00:49:08,591 --> 00:49:08,731
Cheers.

1047
00:49:08,731 --> 00:49:08,891
Cheers.

1048
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:17,577
Cheers.

1049
00:49:17,577 --> 00:49:17,777
Thank you.

1050
00:49:17,777 --> 00:49:17,937
Cheers.

1051
00:49:17,937 --> 00:49:18,117
Cheers.

1052
00:49:18,117 --> 00:49:18,257
Cheers.

1053
00:49:20,638 --> 00:49:20,899
Really?

1054
00:49:20,899 --> 00:49:24,260
It's Friday afternoon and all, you're longing for the beer?

1055
00:49:24,260 --> 00:49:25,220
Hey, how's it going?

1056
00:49:25,220 --> 00:49:26,961
Thanks very much for the talk.

1057
00:49:26,961 --> 00:49:28,641
So on the subject of value creation,

1058
00:49:28,641 --> 00:49:30,442
I don't know if you deal with this a lot,

1059
00:49:30,442 --> 00:49:33,243
but I have sort of a concern about the idea

1060
00:49:33,243 --> 00:49:35,064
of physical merchandise creation and how

1061
00:49:35,064 --> 00:49:38,285
you handle that side of things on the fan side.

1062
00:49:38,285 --> 00:49:41,146
So with the rise of things like RedBubble and other fan sites

1063
00:49:41,146 --> 00:49:42,727
and community sites where people can

1064
00:49:42,727 --> 00:49:45,108
submit their own artwork or variations on your game's

1065
00:49:45,108 --> 00:49:47,168
artwork, how do you kind of handle that stuff?

1066
00:49:47,985 --> 00:49:50,688
you mean people who monetize on your game without telling you?

1067
00:49:50,688 --> 00:49:54,171
Exactly, like someone who's going to make a Crusader Kings 2 shirt and sell it on a

1068
00:49:54,171 --> 00:49:57,114
Redbubble site without your explicit permission and stuff like that.

1069
00:49:57,114 --> 00:50:01,858
I think it's really important to put down...

1070
00:50:02,881 --> 00:50:04,082
to own your brand as well.

1071
00:50:04,082 --> 00:50:06,163
So you need to be very clear that, of course, you can sell

1072
00:50:06,163 --> 00:50:08,384
this, but we need a part of the revenue to continue to

1073
00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:09,424
develop the game and everything.

1074
00:50:09,424 --> 00:50:11,786
So there's nothing strange about that.

1075
00:50:11,786 --> 00:50:13,006
You should just tell people that.

1076
00:50:13,006 --> 00:50:14,827
We're really up front with that.

1077
00:50:14,827 --> 00:50:16,808
So as long as people do it just for fun, it's OK.

1078
00:50:16,808 --> 00:50:19,970
If they start monetizing it, we want in on it, because

1079
00:50:19,970 --> 00:50:21,751
still, we made all the hard work.

1080
00:50:21,751 --> 00:50:23,472
So I don't think that should be a problem.

1081
00:50:23,472 --> 00:50:23,872
Cool.

1082
00:50:23,872 --> 00:50:24,893
Thank you very much.

1083
00:50:24,893 --> 00:50:27,934
Always, when you communicate with value creators, it's very

1084
00:50:27,934 --> 00:50:30,296
important not to start with a lawyer.

1085
00:50:30,296 --> 00:50:30,656
Right.

1086
00:50:31,196 --> 00:50:33,899
Because a lawyer is a very aggressive way to approach someone.

1087
00:50:33,899 --> 00:50:37,502
So if you get a cease and desist letter, people might just post it online and say,

1088
00:50:37,502 --> 00:50:38,683
look at these assholes.

1089
00:50:38,683 --> 00:50:41,125
I'm just trying to do a lot of fun stuff here.

1090
00:50:41,125 --> 00:50:42,987
So send out an email saying, you know what?

1091
00:50:42,987 --> 00:50:44,528
This is our take on the situation.

1092
00:50:44,528 --> 00:50:46,310
What do you say?

1093
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,032
Just be reasonable and nice.

1094
00:50:48,032 --> 00:50:54,077
And most people will actually, yeah, they will understand the situation.

1095
00:50:54,077 --> 00:50:54,157
Cool.

1096
00:50:54,157 --> 00:50:54,698
Thank you again.

1097
00:50:57,633 --> 00:51:02,516
Hi, you talk about high switching costs as something that you want to have in your game.

1098
00:51:02,516 --> 00:51:08,539
I'm wondering if you can talk a little bit about basically the things that give a game a high switching cost

1099
00:51:08,539 --> 00:51:12,342
and games that, things in your game that might take away from that.

1100
00:51:12,342 --> 00:51:14,023
A game that has high switching costs?

1101
00:51:14,023 --> 00:51:18,646
Yeah, yeah, just basically like what practices you think tend to promote that.

1102
00:51:18,646 --> 00:51:23,168
And just to clarify by the way, it seems like mainly what you're talking about is...

1103
00:51:24,218 --> 00:51:30,182
Basically like sunk time and sunk cost this psychological barrier people have to kind of pull away from that are there

1104
00:51:30,182 --> 00:51:34,684
Other elements to it than that as well. Absolutely there are several different ways you

1105
00:51:34,684 --> 00:51:38,006
There are several different switching costs one is for example

1106
00:51:38,006 --> 00:51:44,710
Financial if you put a lot of money into something you will continue like supporting that typically so psychologically

1107
00:51:44,710 --> 00:51:47,552
Once you put one dollar into something you'll continue to support that

1108
00:51:48,152 --> 00:51:52,355
And that's why consultants like to send an invoice as quickly as possible,

1109
00:51:52,355 --> 00:51:56,377
so they can continue to just invoice you, because you'll probably be immune to invoices after a while.

1110
00:51:56,377 --> 00:51:57,458
I've seen that happen all the time.

1111
00:51:57,458 --> 00:52:01,260
But if you take a game with high switching costs,

1112
00:52:01,260 --> 00:52:03,982
the two MOBAs that are the biggest ones have really high switching costs.

1113
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:06,683
And the reason for that is, I play League of Legends myself a lot.

1114
00:52:06,683 --> 00:52:11,806
I could never switch to Dota, both because the mechanics are too complex and I'm not smart enough,

1115
00:52:11,806 --> 00:52:16,069
but to all you Dota 2 players out there, feel that you're better than a League of Legends player.

1116
00:52:18,021 --> 00:52:20,183
But I've learned all the characters in the game.

1117
00:52:20,183 --> 00:52:21,684
So I know exactly all the moves.

1118
00:52:21,684 --> 00:52:23,906
I know exactly how to attack and how to protect myself

1119
00:52:23,906 --> 00:52:24,727
from everything.

1120
00:52:24,727 --> 00:52:26,248
So that's a perfect way of saying

1121
00:52:26,248 --> 00:52:29,051
that gameplay design and character design

1122
00:52:29,051 --> 00:52:32,894
actually adds a lot of switching cost to a game.

1123
00:52:32,894 --> 00:52:33,454
OK, cool.

1124
00:52:33,454 --> 00:52:33,955
Thanks.

1125
00:52:33,955 --> 00:52:34,155
Thanks.

1126
00:52:46,730 --> 00:52:48,793
Okay, cool. I'll let you go.

1127
00:52:48,793 --> 00:52:50,595
Friday beer is for everyone. Take care.
