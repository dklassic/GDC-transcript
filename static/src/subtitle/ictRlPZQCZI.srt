00:01:58,717 --> 00:02:01,520
Hey guys, welcome to the panel, Prompto's Facebook.

2
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:04,723
How Buddy AI auto-snapshot your adventure

3
00:02:04,843 --> 00:02:06,365
in Final Fantasy XV.

4
00:02:07,526 --> 00:02:09,649
Okay, so we start very simple questions.

5
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:12,412
Who in this room have played Final Fantasy XV?

6
00:02:12,432 --> 00:02:12,632
Great.

7
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,422
And maybe for those who haven't played yet, let me summarize this system a bit.

8
00:02:21,262 --> 00:02:24,524
So in Final Fantasy XV, an open-world game,

9
00:02:25,384 --> 00:02:32,428
your friend Prompto took a picture for you during your adventure, and the picture he takes is not an old classic screenshot,

10
00:02:33,449 --> 00:02:37,151
but a stylish smart photo as seen by him inside the game.

11
00:02:38,162 --> 00:02:42,465
And with our built-in SNS interface, since release of the game last year,

12
00:02:43,025 --> 00:02:46,407
his photos are overwhelming internet, Facebooks and Twitters,

13
00:02:46,708 --> 00:02:47,788
having us promoting our game.

14
00:02:48,960 --> 00:02:50,820
So today we will talk about these features

15
00:02:51,601 --> 00:02:56,062
and maybe we won't go through deep into mathematics and algorithm stuff

16
00:02:56,122 --> 00:02:59,663
but we will tell you about the design aspect of these features

17
00:03:00,704 --> 00:03:03,485
and I'm afraid maybe we don't have much time left

18
00:03:04,605 --> 00:03:08,206
but you can always you know just ask me question outside the room or

19
00:03:08,466 --> 00:03:08,846
email me

20
00:03:09,878 --> 00:03:10,659
Well, talk about me.

21
00:03:11,700 --> 00:03:15,243
My name, my real name is Prasad Prasad Wittayagan,

22
00:03:15,823 --> 00:03:17,405
which is, I think it's too long.

23
00:03:17,625 --> 00:03:19,466
So you can call me son,

24
00:03:19,506 --> 00:03:21,488
just as my friends and my coworker do.

25
00:03:22,048 --> 00:03:23,369
So my name is son, nice to meet you.

26
00:03:25,299 --> 00:03:32,485
And I came to Japan 12 years ago, and I specialize in emotional AI.

27
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:38,491
I like to combine arts and AI together to create emotional feelings by AI characters.

28
00:03:39,212 --> 00:03:42,995
And now I'm in Square Enix Tokyo, Business Division 2.

29
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:44,557
You can see on my shirt here.

30
00:03:45,538 --> 00:03:47,520
It's Business Division 2 shirt, studio shirt.

31
00:03:48,965 --> 00:03:53,687
And so now I'm a game designer for Final Fantasy XV,

32
00:03:54,168 --> 00:03:56,569
and I'm in charge of body system and AI.

33
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,730
So if you play this game,

34
00:03:57,750 --> 00:04:00,051
you will know Prompto, Gladiolus, and Ignis.

35
00:04:00,391 --> 00:04:01,292
Well, I'm in charge of them.

36
00:04:01,452 --> 00:04:04,053
I make them, I create their thoughts,

37
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:06,875
their moves, their action, their talks, everything,

38
00:04:07,315 --> 00:04:08,996
including the system relating to them,

39
00:04:09,136 --> 00:04:11,878
just like camp scene or photo system.

40
00:04:13,152 --> 00:04:15,238
So, okay, let's start this panel,

41
00:04:15,338 --> 00:04:17,684
but let me tell you to turn off your my wife phone

42
00:04:17,784 --> 00:04:20,330
and don't forget to reply in the evaluation mail

43
00:04:20,711 --> 00:04:21,433
at the end of this panel.

44
00:04:21,914 --> 00:04:22,436
Okay, we'll start.

45
00:04:24,343 --> 00:04:28,145
Okay, so Final Fantasy XV is an open-world RPG

46
00:04:28,205 --> 00:04:30,526
where you can experience continuous road trip

47
00:04:31,026 --> 00:04:32,087
with your best buddies.

48
00:04:32,867 --> 00:04:34,008
And when we designed this game,

49
00:04:34,208 --> 00:04:37,629
what we feel important the most is the UX,

50
00:04:38,110 --> 00:04:39,230
the user experiences.

51
00:04:39,870 --> 00:04:42,291
So you can see, all system and all designs,

52
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:44,352
all features in this game are there

53
00:04:44,512 --> 00:04:47,214
to maximize the road trip experience for the player.

54
00:04:47,874 --> 00:04:49,494
And of course, when we're talking about road trip,

55
00:04:50,295 --> 00:04:51,095
we're talking about photos.

56
00:04:52,965 --> 00:04:56,426
However, it's difficult to make players take photos inside of a game.

57
00:04:56,506 --> 00:04:59,627
You know, everyone likes photos, but not all might want to take them.

58
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:02,647
But luckily, I was born in Thailand,

59
00:05:03,188 --> 00:05:06,669
and Thai people are well known for their photogenic characteristics.

60
00:05:07,269 --> 00:05:12,150
And, well, I have several camera geek friends who went on a trip with me.

61
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:16,151
Without being asked, they just take lots of pictures of me for me.

62
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:18,592
And that isn't bad.

63
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:20,032
Maybe I'm photogenic too.

64
00:05:20,433 --> 00:05:20,553
So...

65
00:05:21,543 --> 00:05:25,665
We get a new idea that it would be cool if one of your friends inside your party member

66
00:05:25,885 --> 00:05:28,386
can take a picture for you during your road trip.

67
00:05:29,207 --> 00:05:31,668
And Prompto is so kind as to help us.

68
00:05:32,268 --> 00:05:34,709
So that's the beginnings of Prompto snapshots.

69
00:05:37,330 --> 00:05:37,790
Okay.

70
00:05:38,610 --> 00:05:43,172
Now we talk about the goals and policy because we need concrete goals to make a game a good game.

71
00:05:43,692 --> 00:05:46,294
So we have three goals for Prompto snapshots.

72
00:05:47,814 --> 00:05:48,294
Which are...

73
00:05:50,375 --> 00:05:50,575
First...

74
00:05:51,359 --> 00:05:55,302
the photo must serve as an achievement for the experience of players.

75
00:05:55,762 --> 00:05:58,165
So when you've been to a new location, you get photos.

76
00:05:58,545 --> 00:06:00,146
You meet a new character, you get photos.

77
00:06:00,627 --> 00:06:02,689
Been there, done that, anything, you get photos.

78
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:07,032
Well, for memorable moments with your favorite characters too,

79
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:11,696
and also unmemorable moments like when Joker Boy is hitting you,

80
00:06:13,278 --> 00:06:15,280
or when you were sent flying through the air,

81
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,623
or when you were turned into a stone.

82
00:06:19,540 --> 00:06:21,760
Well, anything, anything that you will recall,

83
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,040
and you see the picture at the end of the day,

84
00:06:24,281 --> 00:06:26,361
and you will say, hey, this is my adventure.

85
00:06:26,741 --> 00:06:28,241
This is picture of my gameplay.

86
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:31,142
So this is first design policy for us.

87
00:06:31,662 --> 00:06:33,602
Our photos must be able to express

88
00:06:34,302 --> 00:06:35,502
the player, game's players.

89
00:06:37,543 --> 00:06:37,923
Number two.

90
00:06:39,323 --> 00:06:40,803
So this is my own policy,

91
00:06:40,903 --> 00:06:44,004
but I believe good games should tell more stories

92
00:06:44,064 --> 00:06:47,004
than what has actually been made or been told.

93
00:06:47,605 --> 00:06:48,285
Just see this picture.

94
00:06:50,603 --> 00:06:53,745
Well, you can imagine that he was reading this.

95
00:06:54,686 --> 00:06:56,787
And we didn't make the scene, but you see it.

96
00:06:57,127 --> 00:06:57,808
And that's the trick.

97
00:06:58,288 --> 00:07:01,030
So I used it a lot in the camp scene and in picture.

98
00:07:01,610 --> 00:07:04,232
So we just make photo of them joining,

99
00:07:04,352 --> 00:07:05,793
enjoying themselves together.

100
00:07:06,193 --> 00:07:07,474
And then people see this picture

101
00:07:07,494 --> 00:07:09,095
and they imagine what happened before

102
00:07:09,195 --> 00:07:10,916
and imagine what happened after that.

103
00:07:11,296 --> 00:07:12,877
And they will feel that they're having fun.

104
00:07:13,237 --> 00:07:15,258
And they will feel that this road trip is fun.

105
00:07:15,799 --> 00:07:17,179
And the good thing about this is that

106
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:21,143
We only make one frame of motions, but you see a lot.

107
00:07:21,684 --> 00:07:22,285
And that's a trick.

108
00:07:23,065 --> 00:07:24,287
Also, when you see a picture,

109
00:07:25,128 --> 00:07:27,810
well, automatically, people will create their own stories.

110
00:07:28,251 --> 00:07:30,754
And, you know, everyone's stories might be different,

111
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,477
might not be the same, and that's perfect

112
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:35,238
because you can have a space for you

113
00:07:35,258 --> 00:07:37,321
to create your own characters

114
00:07:37,381 --> 00:07:39,203
and personalize stuff inside your head.

115
00:07:40,537 --> 00:07:45,980
And one more good thing is that when we have two characters outside and they're posing together,

116
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:54,445
you can get illusion of life, as if they actually have their own private life and they're chit-chatting or flirting with each other just outside the screen.

117
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,726
You just don't see it, but they're alive. They're living.

118
00:07:57,606 --> 00:08:00,288
So this is our second design policy.

119
00:08:00,848 --> 00:08:07,272
The photos must be able to stir and wake your imaginations and enrich your road trip adventure.

120
00:08:09,093 --> 00:08:09,453
Number three.

121
00:08:10,929 --> 00:08:11,910
It's our gameplay sharing.

122
00:08:12,831 --> 00:08:16,435
So despite the widespread use of social media,

123
00:08:16,895 --> 00:08:19,018
I believe the gameplay sharing are still limited

124
00:08:19,098 --> 00:08:20,600
to a very small group of players.

125
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:23,623
You know, because it takes effort to watch the clips

126
00:08:24,024 --> 00:08:26,226
and it takes effort to take a good screenshot.

127
00:08:26,847 --> 00:08:29,270
However, with prompter snapshots, you know, it's all auto.

128
00:08:29,310 --> 00:08:29,410
So...

129
00:08:30,988 --> 00:08:33,829
Well, just to share or not to share, that's the only question you have left.

130
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,172
And we want this feature to be a new benchmark for gameplay sharing for the next generation.

131
00:08:40,752 --> 00:08:45,574
And to do that, we must ensure that our photos are unique and fun.

132
00:08:46,454 --> 00:08:50,015
And of course, if you have luck, you get a unique and fun picture.

133
00:08:50,815 --> 00:08:55,157
But however, we game designers believe that luck can be designed,

134
00:08:55,797 --> 00:08:57,538
such as we give this kind of picture.

135
00:08:59,194 --> 00:09:03,659
So normally Ignis wears glasses, but sometimes we give a picture of Ignis without wearing

136
00:09:03,700 --> 00:09:04,100
glasses.

137
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:08,045
So when the player gets this, they feel that they're lucky and they want to share this

138
00:09:08,085 --> 00:09:08,685
to other people.

139
00:09:09,326 --> 00:09:13,051
The same goes for some rare facial expressions and rare emotions.

140
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:15,333
This way we can create luck for the user.

141
00:09:16,074 --> 00:09:23,179
Or we can even do this, having players create their own luck by recreating a thing called

142
00:09:23,239 --> 00:09:28,223
Prompto's snapshot skills, which you replenish a tech bar inside the battles and Prompto will

143
00:09:28,243 --> 00:09:32,546
take a picture of the monster for you. And if you're lucky, he will do selfie monsters.

144
00:09:33,266 --> 00:09:39,511
In this way, users can try to set their own, you know, snapshot environment and they can try and

145
00:09:39,611 --> 00:09:43,734
create their own luck. And when they get a good picture, they can, well, upload it to the internet.

146
00:09:45,158 --> 00:09:50,222
And also, one interesting thing is that you don't need good picture to make people want to share.

147
00:09:50,742 --> 00:09:51,083
Like this.

148
00:09:52,744 --> 00:09:54,985
Well, it's a very bad picture, but it's fun.

149
00:09:55,466 --> 00:09:58,168
So, we shared it, and there's nothing bad about it.

150
00:09:58,688 --> 00:10:03,491
Also, in this kind of situations, when some jerks...

151
00:10:05,226 --> 00:10:06,607
ruining all your souvenir shots.

152
00:10:06,767 --> 00:10:08,248
You know, it's happened once in a while,

153
00:10:08,308 --> 00:10:10,670
but yeah, when it's happening, it's a game, it's fun,

154
00:10:10,790 --> 00:10:13,451
and everyone like to share it, and we're happy with that.

155
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:16,854
And the most, and the best thing that happened

156
00:10:16,894 --> 00:10:19,115
is that when Prompto is the photographer,

157
00:10:19,916 --> 00:10:22,237
he can turn all accident into entertainment.

158
00:10:22,877 --> 00:10:23,978
Everyone just laugh and say,

159
00:10:24,158 --> 00:10:25,779
ha ha, Prompto, you did it again,

160
00:10:25,859 --> 00:10:27,821
and well, that's happy for us

161
00:10:27,881 --> 00:10:30,883
because we chose the right person to do the photographer.

162
00:10:32,145 --> 00:10:34,106
So this is our third design policy.

163
00:10:34,507 --> 00:10:36,068
Our picture should be unique and fun,

164
00:10:36,148 --> 00:10:37,569
filled with pleasure and surprise,

165
00:10:37,969 --> 00:10:39,690
and encourage social activities.

166
00:10:41,151 --> 00:10:42,593
These are our three design policies.

167
00:10:44,494 --> 00:10:45,795
So we get policies,

168
00:10:45,835 --> 00:10:47,776
and now we have to design the system itself.

169
00:10:49,157 --> 00:10:51,699
So there are lots of process before we have a picture.

170
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,022
Start from triggering, which, well,

171
00:10:55,938 --> 00:10:59,419
Humans have several reasons to take pictures and to simulate it.

172
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:01,180
We need several kinds of triggering.

173
00:11:01,860 --> 00:11:04,180
Start from what we call coincident triggers.

174
00:11:04,741 --> 00:11:09,142
It's based on the concept that if you have cool actors doing cool moves,

175
00:11:09,442 --> 00:11:10,602
then it should be cool pictures.

176
00:11:11,302 --> 00:11:15,503
So we have the animator evaluating the animation they have made.

177
00:11:16,404 --> 00:11:22,510
in score in term of interesting or not and then I evaluate each character in term of this character

178
00:11:22,570 --> 00:11:28,155
interesting or not and we combine together and then every frame in the battles we calculate the

179
00:11:28,195 --> 00:11:33,941
score and try to maximize the score while fitting well as many characters into the frame as much as

180
00:11:34,001 --> 00:11:38,866
possible and when the frame and the score is high enough we can be sure that that's cool pictures.

181
00:11:40,687 --> 00:11:46,112
And we also have event triggers, so we snapshot when we're sure that we can express the player

182
00:11:46,152 --> 00:11:52,318
adventure when we shot this time, like in cinematics, or in special, well, interactive

183
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,321
events, or when you reach new destinations.

184
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,092
And three, we have a thing called Wim Tickers.

185
00:11:59,592 --> 00:12:01,474
It's based on the concept that, after all,

186
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:03,775
you don't need reason to take picture of your friend,

187
00:12:03,835 --> 00:12:04,055
do you?

188
00:12:04,816 --> 00:12:05,717
Well, I do too.

189
00:12:05,897 --> 00:12:08,198
When I have camera in my hand, I just take picture of my friend.

190
00:12:08,539 --> 00:12:09,399
No reason is needed.

191
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:11,461
And usually, you get good picture

192
00:12:11,661 --> 00:12:14,583
because your friend is good looking, and he has nice hair.

193
00:12:15,743 --> 00:12:16,624
So that's the technique.

194
00:12:17,164 --> 00:12:17,965
Well, after is WIM.

195
00:12:18,705 --> 00:12:21,666
But although we say WIM, there's a pattern behind this.

196
00:12:22,206 --> 00:12:25,668
So actually, we take WIM triggers only

197
00:12:25,748 --> 00:12:28,629
when there are no other triggering events around.

198
00:12:29,410 --> 00:12:31,051
So this way, WIM trigger can help

199
00:12:31,251 --> 00:12:35,032
us to control the distribution of the picture during the day.

200
00:12:35,473 --> 00:12:38,174
So it ensures us that we can get a picture in the night

201
00:12:38,694 --> 00:12:40,535
or in the evening when the sunset is beautiful.

202
00:12:41,475 --> 00:12:43,957
And also, when there are no interesting events around,

203
00:12:44,497 --> 00:12:45,197
we can create one.

204
00:12:46,827 --> 00:12:50,208
Even the boring cave could be fun if the characters look fun.

205
00:12:50,988 --> 00:12:51,349
And that's it.

206
00:12:53,649 --> 00:12:55,010
And also we have menu triggers,

207
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:59,811
so like souvenir photos or the skill snapshot

208
00:13:00,291 --> 00:13:01,852
in battle that I just described to you.

209
00:13:03,412 --> 00:13:05,113
So you can see that these four triggers

210
00:13:06,197 --> 00:13:11,439
Actually matched really well with the three design policy we had, well because we designed

211
00:13:11,499 --> 00:13:16,581
that way, but you know what I like to say is that no trigger is perfect, but combined

212
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:22,424
together it can answer the requirements we had before and it can simulate reason for

213
00:13:22,464 --> 00:13:24,105
people to take photos.

214
00:13:26,224 --> 00:13:28,126
Now we go to next step of theme selections.

215
00:13:28,767 --> 00:13:31,089
Now we have decided when to take pictures.

216
00:13:31,329 --> 00:13:33,911
Now we have to decide what and how to take pictures.

217
00:13:34,032 --> 00:13:34,892
And that is a theme.

218
00:13:35,633 --> 00:13:37,174
Each theme has its own styles,

219
00:13:37,635 --> 00:13:40,237
own subject choices and framing algorithm.

220
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:44,021
So there are up to 20 themes inside this scheme,

221
00:13:44,381 --> 00:13:45,162
but to make it simple,

222
00:13:45,202 --> 00:13:47,004
let's say we have three big category.

223
00:13:47,704 --> 00:13:49,186
We call this joyful category,

224
00:13:49,446 --> 00:13:51,128
wonderful and exciting category.

225
00:13:52,715 --> 00:13:56,278
The Joyful category focuses on snapshotting characters,

226
00:13:56,698 --> 00:13:59,941
like portrait, or open, two-shot,

227
00:14:00,781 --> 00:14:04,044
together, driver, or selfie,

228
00:14:04,404 --> 00:14:06,626
anything that will make the character look appealing.

229
00:14:08,267 --> 00:14:11,470
And wow, the theme, well, why the category, wonderful,

230
00:14:11,670 --> 00:14:14,132
focuses on the world itself, and using wide angle,

231
00:14:14,493 --> 00:14:17,155
like when you're running, or riding jogger ball,

232
00:14:17,975 --> 00:14:18,476
or in the car.

233
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:25,287
And this category, exciting, will focus on the most mirror of the combat,

234
00:14:26,588 --> 00:14:30,270
like one-on-one or battlefield itself.

235
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:36,033
And it usually uses strong tilt to simulate the situations.

236
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:42,914
We also have preset theme because in cinematic we can't just show everything that happened

237
00:14:42,954 --> 00:14:43,655
behind cinematics.

238
00:14:43,675 --> 00:14:45,436
You know, the artist will just angry at me.

239
00:14:46,077 --> 00:14:52,641
And sometimes we do this too and we feel that it's worth sacrificing the uniqueness for

240
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:56,204
the sake of perfect background, like to fit this waterfall inside the pictures.

241
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,960
So that's finished the scene selections.

242
00:15:00,481 --> 00:15:02,302
Now we do details enhancement.

243
00:15:02,882 --> 00:15:05,884
We have to do this because sometimes reality can be boring,

244
00:15:06,245 --> 00:15:08,626
nothing happens, but you need variety

245
00:15:08,666 --> 00:15:09,887
and life into the pictures.

246
00:15:10,547 --> 00:15:15,191
So the key is that we separate rendering in the photo world

247
00:15:15,791 --> 00:15:18,133
and rendering in the game world apart,

248
00:15:18,653 --> 00:15:20,774
and then we can secretly change the things

249
00:15:20,854 --> 00:15:23,056
inside the photo world without having the player

250
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:25,497
realizing what happens inside the gameplay world.

251
00:15:26,218 --> 00:15:30,624
And we can do things like this, having Noctis facing us and smile, she's.

252
00:15:31,466 --> 00:15:38,135
And it's really amazing that just making the character she's really improve the believability of the photo you get.

253
00:15:38,736 --> 00:15:42,321
It's seen that, well, you know, humans are eye contacts after all, I guess.

254
00:15:43,404 --> 00:15:45,245
And then we can do posing and saturations,

255
00:15:45,685 --> 00:15:48,845
or we can add things, well, bodies to do interactions.

256
00:15:49,325 --> 00:15:50,366
And of course we can do this.

257
00:15:51,206 --> 00:15:53,126
Adding Gentiana, photo bombing.

258
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:55,047
Well, she's a mysterious woman

259
00:15:55,507 --> 00:15:57,367
who appears time to time in the photos

260
00:15:57,887 --> 00:15:59,048
when actually she wasn't there.

261
00:16:00,228 --> 00:16:01,908
And we add her in because I think it's fun.

262
00:16:02,408 --> 00:16:05,089
And you know, when people get Gentiana,

263
00:16:05,129 --> 00:16:06,189
they feel they are lucky

264
00:16:06,289 --> 00:16:08,250
and they want to share this photo too.

265
00:16:10,590 --> 00:16:12,711
And then we do framing calculations.

266
00:16:13,638 --> 00:16:20,444
We do it by using the bone information and the collision environment to create a good frame for each picture.

267
00:16:21,004 --> 00:16:25,408
Each theme has its own frames and we won't go through them here, though.

268
00:16:25,908 --> 00:16:30,833
But please know that we try to use Prompto's position as much as possible for the sake of believability.

269
00:16:32,470 --> 00:16:34,231
And then we do knowledge presentation.

270
00:16:34,631 --> 00:16:38,273
It means we try to embed as much information as possible

271
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,014
into the picture.

272
00:16:39,374 --> 00:16:42,355
What, who, when, why, how, into the picture.

273
00:16:42,756 --> 00:16:44,617
And then we use the information text

274
00:16:45,377 --> 00:16:49,119
for the further operations, such as post-filtering.

275
00:16:50,797 --> 00:16:53,519
Well, I like Instagram and lots of filter here

276
00:16:53,960 --> 00:16:56,902
and Prompto also use filters to the photos too.

277
00:16:57,603 --> 00:16:59,725
But the problem is there are some filter

278
00:16:59,785 --> 00:17:03,248
that doesn't match well with some photos like this.

279
00:17:04,249 --> 00:17:06,451
You know, you don't want monochrome selfie, right?

280
00:17:06,672 --> 00:17:07,392
It doesn't look good.

281
00:17:07,913 --> 00:17:10,355
Or in this case, how do we call this?

282
00:17:10,696 --> 00:17:11,156
I think it's...

283
00:17:12,032 --> 00:17:14,132
Japanese photo booth blooming.

284
00:17:14,812 --> 00:17:16,593
It's for a beauty purpose, not battle purpose.

285
00:17:16,953 --> 00:17:20,534
So we don't want this to happen a lot in the game,

286
00:17:20,594 --> 00:17:24,075
so we used information text to screen this property out.

287
00:17:24,975 --> 00:17:26,335
But after all, it's preference,

288
00:17:26,375 --> 00:17:28,376
so you can tune that inside the setting menu.

289
00:17:30,216 --> 00:17:31,677
And then we do auto-albuming.

290
00:17:32,815 --> 00:17:36,837
At the end of the day, Prompto will show you what happens during the day with his pictures.

291
00:17:37,477 --> 00:17:41,578
And we don't want the user to spend too much time looking at this, so we try to reduce

292
00:17:41,598 --> 00:17:44,959
the number of pictures from 8 to 12 pictures per day.

293
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:52,282
But do you know that we actually took more than 20 pictures per day, and we have to delete

294
00:17:52,342 --> 00:17:53,202
some pictures away.

295
00:17:54,082 --> 00:18:00,844
And to delete the right picture and to keep the right picture there to express one day

296
00:18:01,285 --> 00:18:01,785
is tricky.

297
00:18:02,325 --> 00:18:07,452
things. Considering this, we have five pictures here and you want to choose only four and delete

298
00:18:07,552 --> 00:18:09,815
one. Which one should we delete? Ten seconds.

299
00:18:17,703 --> 00:18:20,365
Well, there might be no one answer,

300
00:18:20,485 --> 00:18:22,666
but for us, we use information tags.

301
00:18:23,387 --> 00:18:25,689
And we feel that we should keep some information tag

302
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,970
that is interesting and unique, like jogable,

303
00:18:28,531 --> 00:18:30,972
like sunset, like night, or like battles,

304
00:18:31,553 --> 00:18:33,755
while we should delete some that are redundant,

305
00:18:33,995 --> 00:18:35,976
like running or broad view.

306
00:18:36,737 --> 00:18:38,658
So the answer, we try to delete this picture.

307
00:18:38,959 --> 00:18:40,280
Yes, yes, you're right.

308
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:43,843
But things get trickier when we have lots of pictures around.

309
00:18:44,283 --> 00:18:45,684
So we need a proper algorithm.

310
00:18:45,744 --> 00:18:50,448
So we make our own algorithm regarding redundancy score

311
00:18:50,589 --> 00:18:54,592
and uniqueness score, which can earn its own panel.

312
00:18:54,652 --> 00:18:56,033
But OK, we won't explain them here.

313
00:18:56,494 --> 00:18:59,396
But OK, we do some trick to get a big picture for you guys.

314
00:19:00,917 --> 00:19:04,280
And then we do things like this when we show you the pictures.

315
00:19:05,334 --> 00:19:06,895
Why is your face so fat?

316
00:19:07,015 --> 00:19:09,418
I'm not fat! Selfies make it look that way!

317
00:19:09,998 --> 00:19:11,300
Yes, we play conversations.

318
00:19:13,101 --> 00:19:15,904
Stylish is always welcome now, it's nothing special.

319
00:19:16,685 --> 00:19:20,849
And we try to make this conversation as much as teenager conversation as possible.

320
00:19:22,070 --> 00:19:23,011
Picture perfect!

321
00:19:23,792 --> 00:19:24,973
God damn it!

322
00:19:26,627 --> 00:19:30,631
So the key is that to make the player feel that they are actually inside the campfire

323
00:19:30,691 --> 00:19:34,455
and look in the picture with the buddies, not looking through UI.

324
00:19:34,876 --> 00:19:37,319
This is all for road trip experience.

325
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:42,605
And this concludes our process for Prompto Snapshots.

326
00:19:44,467 --> 00:19:45,328
Then, what do we get?

327
00:19:46,728 --> 00:19:51,872
So I believe what we would get from this is the most powerful storytelling tool.

328
00:19:52,312 --> 00:19:55,155
One of the most powerful storytelling tools in Final Fantasy XV.

329
00:19:56,156 --> 00:19:58,417
You know, there are some guys who say things like this,

330
00:19:59,198 --> 00:20:00,559
RPG is a story.

331
00:20:01,642 --> 00:20:03,143
Well, Gladiola doesn't say that, though,

332
00:20:03,623 --> 00:20:05,303
but a lot of people say this.

333
00:20:05,903 --> 00:20:07,604
And for me, I think it's half correct.

334
00:20:08,144 --> 00:20:11,145
The other half is, RPG is storytelling.

335
00:20:11,465 --> 00:20:13,745
You know, story and storytelling, it's come together.

336
00:20:14,506 --> 00:20:15,746
And you see, when I was a child,

337
00:20:16,366 --> 00:20:19,327
I played Final Fantasy VII, and when,

338
00:20:20,647 --> 00:20:23,048
okay, spoiler alert, when Aerith die,

339
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:26,015
When I reached that, I cried a lot.

340
00:20:26,696 --> 00:20:29,058
And since then, I wanted to be a game designer

341
00:20:29,099 --> 00:20:30,560
to make a game that made people cry.

342
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:33,804
Because I believe crying during entertainment

343
00:20:33,884 --> 00:20:36,267
is one of the greatest happiness mankind could have.

344
00:20:37,008 --> 00:20:38,630
And so now I'm here, making a game,

345
00:20:38,650 --> 00:20:39,331
making Final Fantasy.

346
00:20:39,351 --> 00:20:39,451
So.

347
00:20:40,792 --> 00:20:48,258
The problem is, can we really rely on storytelling by cinematics and linear level scripts as we used to do before?

348
00:20:48,919 --> 00:20:55,124
When Final Fantasy XV is a story about bonds and brotherhoods, and we are an open world game.

349
00:20:56,557 --> 00:20:59,697
So how can we possibly persist on doing the storytelling

350
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,438
with cinematic linear level script

351
00:21:01,978 --> 00:21:05,598
when players spend more than 99% of the time running

352
00:21:06,278 --> 00:21:08,459
or fighting monsters inside a world map with their friends?

353
00:21:09,259 --> 00:21:11,479
So if you want to do storytelling of brotherhoods

354
00:21:11,539 --> 00:21:14,700
and bonds inside open world map, do it in the gameplay.

355
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:17,921
And that's by AI, and that's by using photos.

356
00:21:18,261 --> 00:21:18,961
That's my answer.

357
00:21:20,121 --> 00:21:22,322
And photos have their own power, their own magic.

358
00:21:22,722 --> 00:21:24,322
They can create emotional pulse.

359
00:21:25,042 --> 00:21:25,162
So.

360
00:21:26,690 --> 00:21:31,451
All the information in the picture just come sudden to you and strong enough to create

361
00:21:31,611 --> 00:21:32,912
some power inside your heart.

362
00:21:33,552 --> 00:21:39,394
Especially in the very last part of this game when we want to do a storytelling of the loss

363
00:21:39,514 --> 00:21:41,474
of friendships, the loss of brotherhood.

364
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:46,896
Well we can't tell you much because we don't really want to spoil you but it's difficult

365
00:21:46,936 --> 00:21:52,477
to do storytelling of loss because you know it takes time to accumulate but you need some

366
00:21:52,517 --> 00:21:53,518
trigger to release it.

367
00:21:54,481 --> 00:22:02,987
And to make people feel lost is easy, but it's difficult because people can't recall what exactly has been lost.

368
00:22:03,367 --> 00:22:04,568
They didn't see the picture.

369
00:22:05,248 --> 00:22:06,969
And that's when the photo came in.

370
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,011
I believe photos are time machines.

371
00:22:10,432 --> 00:22:11,352
It can bring us back.

372
00:22:11,492 --> 00:22:16,917
to the very moment the picture was taken and it stirs our memory and make us recall the

373
00:22:16,997 --> 00:22:21,401
old day and it tells us that that good old day will never ever come again.

374
00:22:21,941 --> 00:22:26,706
And that strong punch, that strong emotion pulse is strong enough to make the player

375
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,048
who are really into our game cry.

376
00:22:29,508 --> 00:22:30,089
We've been lucky.

377
00:22:31,089 --> 00:22:32,030
And I think we're lucky.

378
00:22:34,212 --> 00:22:34,572
And so...

379
00:22:36,056 --> 00:22:42,138
Well, we come to the last part, so I want to share with you the lesson I got from making these features

380
00:22:42,739 --> 00:22:46,380
because Prompto Snapshot is a very challenging and very new

381
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:50,802
too new, so we have our own lots of problems that I think I could share

382
00:22:52,377 --> 00:22:56,280
The first thing I'd like to share is that you need to sacrifice something.

383
00:22:56,941 --> 00:23:01,504
You can't do everything, especially when you're trying to make a new feature or new things

384
00:23:01,604 --> 00:23:04,987
that no one actually knows how far we could or could not go.

385
00:23:05,507 --> 00:23:06,428
No one knows the scope.

386
00:23:06,948 --> 00:23:11,111
Then there will be lots of temptations coming in from the outside, from the inside.

387
00:23:11,652 --> 00:23:14,934
And if you don't have a very concrete goal, you will go astray.

388
00:23:15,355 --> 00:23:18,237
And then you will spend time doing things that you don't really want.

389
00:23:19,049 --> 00:23:21,890
So, try to hang on to your goals, make it clear.

390
00:23:22,730 --> 00:23:25,311
For example, for Prompto Snapshot Temptation 1,

391
00:23:26,011 --> 00:23:28,031
why don't we have Prompto improve its photo skill?

392
00:23:28,432 --> 00:23:30,832
Which sounds good, and of course, costly.

393
00:23:31,712 --> 00:23:35,653
So, we revise our design goals again.

394
00:23:36,414 --> 00:23:38,514
With express gameplay, well, maybe not.

395
00:23:38,954 --> 00:23:40,235
Story imagination, maybe not.

396
00:23:40,735 --> 00:23:42,435
Encourage SNS, maybe yes.

397
00:23:43,363 --> 00:23:44,183
depends on the skills.

398
00:23:44,964 --> 00:23:47,366
So we know that we should engage into this feature,

399
00:23:47,506 --> 00:23:48,386
but not too much.

400
00:23:49,007 --> 00:23:51,228
Just enough to answer our goal will be enough.

401
00:23:52,129 --> 00:23:55,131
So our solution is that Prompto will not improve

402
00:23:55,211 --> 00:23:57,472
its framing algorithm because no one will understand,

403
00:23:58,433 --> 00:23:59,874
rather than we give them new filters

404
00:24:00,554 --> 00:24:03,156
and giving selfie unlocked or self-shot unlocked.

405
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:06,278
And this watch make way much happier for the user.

406
00:24:06,598 --> 00:24:08,159
They can use it to post in the internet

407
00:24:08,539 --> 00:24:10,000
and we can get our goal

408
00:24:10,841 --> 00:24:12,382
and we can sacrifice only one thing.

409
00:24:13,512 --> 00:24:16,735
Temptation 2, why don't we allow players to freely instruct

410
00:24:16,815 --> 00:24:18,416
from what and when to snapshot?

411
00:24:18,797 --> 00:24:19,998
This sounds very great.

412
00:24:20,478 --> 00:24:23,381
And this kind of temptation comes to me a lot from outside

413
00:24:23,521 --> 00:24:24,962
when we are developing it.

414
00:24:26,003 --> 00:24:27,364
So we revise our goals again.

415
00:24:27,384 --> 00:24:31,788
Oh, it's costly because we don't have interface.

416
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:34,851
You have to be able for a user to tell what and when.

417
00:24:35,431 --> 00:24:36,972
And we don't have any buttons left.

418
00:24:37,825 --> 00:24:38,545
in the controllers.

419
00:24:39,385 --> 00:24:41,526
And also, when you point the camera to someone,

420
00:24:41,626 --> 00:24:44,026
normally people do the V sign or maybe do,

421
00:24:44,126 --> 00:24:45,367
no, no, don't take me, anything.

422
00:24:45,747 --> 00:24:46,727
And that's very costly.

423
00:24:47,727 --> 00:24:50,128
And then we revised our goals.

424
00:24:50,928 --> 00:24:53,849
And well, since the user take it, it might express gameplay.

425
00:24:54,589 --> 00:24:57,650
It doesn't stir imagination, but well, it's unique.

426
00:24:57,950 --> 00:24:58,470
So it's good.

427
00:24:58,890 --> 00:25:00,130
So we feel we need to do this.

428
00:25:01,111 --> 00:25:02,251
So the solution is that.

429
00:25:03,682 --> 00:25:05,423
we make prompter snapshot skill in battles.

430
00:25:06,143 --> 00:25:08,244
Because in battles, we already have interface

431
00:25:08,264 --> 00:25:10,985
for telling the buddies to do what and when.

432
00:25:11,966 --> 00:25:16,048
And the monster do not do V signs, so it's very cheap.

433
00:25:16,829 --> 00:25:22,331
And I second something, I find that we cannot have prompter

434
00:25:22,452 --> 00:25:25,913
take picture by our instructions outside the battles,

435
00:25:26,294 --> 00:25:28,034
but we get something and we reach our goal,

436
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:29,295
and that's, it's enough.

437
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:34,992
Well, Temps of Entry, why don't we have the buddies playing posing animation in an actual

438
00:25:35,033 --> 00:25:37,574
gameplay with our goods too, and very costly.

439
00:25:38,215 --> 00:25:39,315
And then we reveal our goal.

440
00:25:39,896 --> 00:25:40,036
No.

441
00:25:40,676 --> 00:25:40,817
No.

442
00:25:41,337 --> 00:25:41,477
No.

443
00:25:42,978 --> 00:25:43,178
No.

444
00:25:43,999 --> 00:25:44,099
No.

445
00:25:44,119 --> 00:25:44,199
No.

446
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:50,323
So, the key is, you must be very clear about what you really want, because when you know

447
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,065
what you really want, you will know what you don't really want.

448
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:57,088
And if you can't sacrifice what you don't really want to get what you really want, then

449
00:25:57,488 --> 00:25:57,949
just do it.

450
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:00,190
Number two.

451
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:03,276
Be a researcher, but be a producer.

452
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:07,222
So I am an AI researcher too, and we AI researchers,

453
00:26:07,683 --> 00:26:08,344
well, let's say.

454
00:26:09,247 --> 00:26:14,769
Making AI is fun and we have ego to try to answer all the problems with AI.

455
00:26:15,270 --> 00:26:17,470
And we try to do this too with Prompto Snapshot.

456
00:26:17,811 --> 00:26:20,512
We try to challenge 100% AI framing.

457
00:26:21,472 --> 00:26:25,053
And one big task we have is to put the landmark into the frame

458
00:26:25,414 --> 00:26:26,754
to create sense of locations.

459
00:26:27,214 --> 00:26:30,055
We try, you know, light direction calculating,

460
00:26:30,336 --> 00:26:33,477
try to fit the moon, try to fit the mountain and the lake into the frame.

461
00:26:34,057 --> 00:26:36,258
But, well, it didn't go well.

462
00:26:36,998 --> 00:26:37,078
And...

463
00:26:37,818 --> 00:26:38,871
Well, so...

464
00:26:40,480 --> 00:26:43,542
I turn myself from researcher to producer and I say,

465
00:26:44,003 --> 00:26:46,564
well, we might not be able to finish this

466
00:26:46,644 --> 00:26:47,765
before the shipping end of the game.

467
00:26:48,386 --> 00:26:50,167
And so we give up and find a new way,

468
00:26:50,587 --> 00:26:52,489
like using semi-preset camera.

469
00:26:53,009 --> 00:26:55,270
So the location of the character is preset

470
00:26:55,851 --> 00:26:59,113
and the directions of the photo is preset,

471
00:26:59,433 --> 00:27:02,215
but then you calculate AI framing from that point.

472
00:27:02,676 --> 00:27:04,837
What you get is that you get variety of pictures,

473
00:27:05,237 --> 00:27:08,440
but all the picture has the landmark location

474
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:09,200
inside the frame.

475
00:27:10,524 --> 00:27:12,605
So, as a producer, we are successful.

476
00:27:13,225 --> 00:27:17,128
But as an AI researcher, are we defeated?

477
00:27:17,228 --> 00:27:17,788
Are we failed?

478
00:27:18,769 --> 00:27:19,269
Maybe not.

479
00:27:19,890 --> 00:27:22,231
Because, you know, with all these picture in,

480
00:27:22,792 --> 00:27:24,973
user wanna know or maybe wanna care

481
00:27:25,173 --> 00:27:28,575
which picture AI calculated or preset.

482
00:27:28,635 --> 00:27:29,396
No, no one cares.

483
00:27:30,116 --> 00:27:31,257
It's just fun, you know.

484
00:27:32,398 --> 00:27:33,939
So, that's one good answer I have.

485
00:27:35,509 --> 00:27:37,651
And also, the last thing I'd like to share with you is that

486
00:27:38,011 --> 00:27:39,753
when you're doing a new thing, it's

487
00:27:39,813 --> 00:27:43,316
really hard to share the final visions with other people.

488
00:27:44,217 --> 00:27:46,699
So don't give up, and time will tell.

489
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:49,502
Because now in this day, when everything is finished,

490
00:27:49,762 --> 00:27:52,104
people come to me and say, well, Prompto Snapshot is great.

491
00:27:52,384 --> 00:27:53,906
They say to me, and I'm happy.

492
00:27:54,386 --> 00:27:56,288
But during the time of developing,

493
00:27:56,668 --> 00:27:59,751
many, many people just say that this feature doesn't work.

494
00:28:00,592 --> 00:28:03,014
You know, it doesn't help a game to be fun or anything at all.

495
00:28:03,635 --> 00:28:07,480
And it's my job to try to convince them every day, every day.

496
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,724
But it's difficult because Prompto Synapse Shot is not about making photos,

497
00:28:11,744 --> 00:28:13,446
it's about making photo experiences.

498
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:16,770
And we can't share experiences unless we finish making it.

499
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:24,218
So, what I'd like to say to you guys is that if you guys are challengers and you're trying to make new things that no one knows before,

500
00:28:24,598 --> 00:28:30,044
be prepared for not being understood, be prepared for critics and naysayers.

501
00:28:30,704 --> 00:28:37,231
But if you're believing you're the right thing, the good thing, then just walk tall and struggle and never ever give up.

502
00:28:39,219 --> 00:28:44,872
So, to put it in simple, be a researcher, be a producer, you can sacrifice something but never give up.

503
00:28:45,293 --> 00:28:47,900
And that's the key to making something new, I guess.

504
00:28:49,661 --> 00:28:51,382
At last, before I show you the last picture,

505
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:53,783
let me say that, well, at the very end,

506
00:28:53,983 --> 00:28:55,024
the last, that's my email.

507
00:28:55,284 --> 00:28:57,165
You can email me to talk with me with anything

508
00:28:57,305 --> 00:28:58,046
I'd like to discuss.

509
00:28:58,506 --> 00:29:01,268
And our studio email, Business Division 2,

510
00:29:01,888 --> 00:29:03,309
we are looking for the challenger too,

511
00:29:03,389 --> 00:29:05,570
so if you have, you know, you can email us.

512
00:29:06,451 --> 00:29:09,052
And, well, this is our last picture of my team,

513
00:29:09,232 --> 00:29:09,853
snapshot team.

514
00:29:10,373 --> 00:29:13,134
Without this guy, this feature could not ever come true.

515
00:29:13,475 --> 00:29:14,495
So, thank you very much.

516
00:29:22,112 --> 00:29:23,312
Can I have just one question?

517
00:29:23,372 --> 00:29:24,833
And then we do other Q&A outside.

518
00:29:26,994 --> 00:29:27,694
I have a question.

519
00:29:28,374 --> 00:29:30,315
So I used the feature a bunch in the game,

520
00:29:30,475 --> 00:29:34,297
and I noticed that Prompto would take lots of pictures

521
00:29:35,017 --> 00:29:40,820
of the main character mounting a Chocobo.

522
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,882
So I'd get butt shots of my character mounting a Chocobo.

523
00:29:45,502 --> 00:29:46,403
And I liked the picture.

524
00:29:46,423 --> 00:29:47,163
I saved it.

525
00:29:47,923 --> 00:29:50,364
So after that, it kept showing me pictures of.

526
00:29:51,272 --> 00:29:57,239
my butt mounting the chocobo over and over again. I was wondering is there part of your

527
00:29:57,339 --> 00:30:02,025
algorithm that is it my fault? Like is it because I saved that picture and because I

528
00:30:02,065 --> 00:30:07,972
liked the picture of seeing my character's butt that it keeps showing me? Did Prompto

529
00:30:08,012 --> 00:30:10,475
keep taking pictures of that because it thought that's what I liked?

530
00:30:11,015 --> 00:30:13,037
Well, it's not purposely, but there are reasons.

531
00:30:13,537 --> 00:30:16,580
So we try to keep prompter locations as much as possible.

532
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:19,923
So if me and you ran too fast and prompter couldn't run in front of you,

533
00:30:20,343 --> 00:30:22,405
and that's the reason, so maybe you should run slower.

534
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:27,589
Yeah, I usually am in a rush to jump on the code, so that could be my fault that way.

535
00:30:27,689 --> 00:30:30,011
But I was wondering if there was any code that you wrote.

536
00:30:30,071 --> 00:30:31,392
No, no, I don't like bots.

537
00:30:33,129 --> 00:30:33,410
Thank you.

538
00:30:34,311 --> 00:30:35,854
OK, so I think we run out of time,

539
00:30:35,874 --> 00:30:38,378
but I'm really happy to discuss with you guys,

540
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,141
maybe outside the room or maybe here.

541
00:30:40,222 --> 00:30:42,986
So see you then, and enjoy the rest of the panel,

542
00:30:43,047 --> 00:30:43,888
and enjoy our game too.
