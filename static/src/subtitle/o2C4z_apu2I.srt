00:00:04,656 --> 00:00:08,737
Hello everybody. Welcome to Offroad Trading Company and RTS

2
00:00:08,737 --> 00:00:12,238
without guns. Before we get started, please remember to

3
00:00:12,238 --> 00:00:15,279
silence your cell phones. All right. So, all right. There we

4
00:00:15,279 --> 00:00:20,961
go. That's exciting. All right. So, this is, these are the games

5
00:00:20,961 --> 00:00:25,823
that I've shipped, which shows that my main background is a

6
00:00:25,823 --> 00:00:26,724
strategy game developer.

7
00:00:29,172 --> 00:00:30,052
Oh my gosh.

8
00:00:30,052 --> 00:00:32,254
And this is who I am now.

9
00:00:32,254 --> 00:00:33,896
This is the project I've been working on

10
00:00:33,896 --> 00:00:35,898
for the last three years.

11
00:00:35,898 --> 00:00:36,819
Awful Training Company.

12
00:00:36,819 --> 00:00:40,342
And in fact, this is a game I've wanted to make

13
00:00:40,342 --> 00:00:41,903
kind of my entire career.

14
00:00:41,903 --> 00:00:45,126
And so I was very excited I finally got a chance to do that.

15
00:00:45,647 --> 00:00:49,028
And one of the things I want to talk about today is I really

16
00:00:49,028 --> 00:00:53,449
feel that real-time strategy is actually an underexplored

17
00:00:53,449 --> 00:00:57,070
genre. That there is a lot more possibilities out there than

18
00:00:57,070 --> 00:01:02,852
what we see from the current RTS games. So, what makes an RTS?

19
00:01:02,852 --> 00:01:06,093
Some of the things we often think of are not having a high

20
00:01:06,093 --> 00:01:09,114
APM, actions per minute, a game where you're selecting a lot of

21
00:01:09,114 --> 00:01:12,095
units, moving around really quickly.

22
00:01:13,776 --> 00:01:23,208
have war, they tend to be, hold on, I'm sorry. There we go.

23
00:01:29,648 --> 00:01:31,430
All right, they tend to be short games.

24
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,133
They tend to involve combat.

25
00:01:35,133 --> 00:01:37,675
You know, this is what you think of as a traditional RTS.

26
00:01:37,675 --> 00:01:42,299
However, if you dig a little deeper, what about Majesty?

27
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:46,222
That was a fantastic RTS game that had no unit selection.

28
00:01:46,222 --> 00:01:49,104
You basically just put down bounties on the map

29
00:01:49,104 --> 00:01:52,027
and the units kind of moved around based off of like these,

30
00:01:52,027 --> 00:01:53,508
you know, you basically put down,

31
00:01:53,508 --> 00:01:56,671
so if you attack this, you know, this works here,

32
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:57,672
I'll give you a certain amount of money.

33
00:01:58,027 --> 00:02:03,188
and the units kind of followed around according to those wishes. Or, Adam's zombie

34
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:09,691
smasher, which is a game that had no fog of war. Or what about Sins of a Solar Empire,

35
00:02:09,691 --> 00:02:19,714
which is almost like a 4X RTS. These games, a game of sins often took 3, 4, 5 hours. So,

36
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:20,915
what about a game with no combat?

37
00:02:22,492 --> 00:02:25,853
and most importantly, I didn't just pick three random RTS games

38
00:02:25,853 --> 00:02:29,314
to show that you can buck conventions. These are all

39
00:02:29,314 --> 00:02:33,135
three classics in the genre. If you could only play four RTS

40
00:02:33,135 --> 00:02:37,096
games, you'd be much better off playing each of these three and

41
00:02:37,096 --> 00:02:39,817
just one from the first set of games I showed you.

42
00:02:40,197 --> 00:02:43,300
which were StarCraft, Command and Conquer, Age of Empires,

43
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,363
Company of Heroes. They're all great games but to some extent

44
00:02:46,363 --> 00:02:48,926
they're a little bit interchangeable because they

45
00:02:48,926 --> 00:02:52,209
have a lot of the same parts. And kind of at a core level

46
00:02:52,209 --> 00:02:56,513
they're kind of trying to do the same thing. So how can we make

47
00:02:56,513 --> 00:02:57,734
an RTS without combat?

48
00:02:59,433 --> 00:03:05,180
So this is what an operating company looks like. And it is

49
00:03:05,180 --> 00:03:08,944
economic RTS. So what that means is the conflict in the game

50
00:03:08,944 --> 00:03:11,547
revolves around the free market. There's a lot of resources in

51
00:03:11,547 --> 00:03:15,592
the game. You know, typical RTS you might have two to four

52
00:03:15,592 --> 00:03:16,673
resources. We have 13.

53
00:03:17,094 --> 00:03:21,156
and each of them has a price. And the price goes up and down

54
00:03:21,156 --> 00:03:25,118
depending upon player actions. If players make a lot of iron

55
00:03:25,118 --> 00:03:28,460
and sell it in the market, it goes down. If players are

56
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:33,183
buying a lot of food, then the price goes up. And basically you

57
00:03:33,183 --> 00:03:36,724
do well at the game by figuring out what are the resources that

58
00:03:36,724 --> 00:03:38,085
are going to have, you know,

59
00:03:38,185 --> 00:03:39,927
the highest demand and the least supply.

60
00:03:39,927 --> 00:03:42,128
You look around, what's going to be worth a lot

61
00:03:42,128 --> 00:03:45,031
in a couple days and what are my opponents

62
00:03:45,031 --> 00:03:46,372
producing the least of?

63
00:03:46,372 --> 00:03:47,953
That's how you're able to make a lot of money.

64
00:03:47,953 --> 00:03:50,755
There's no direct combat and the game ends

65
00:03:50,755 --> 00:03:52,717
basically with a hostile takeover.

66
00:03:52,717 --> 00:03:55,639
So the aggression in the game is in the stock market.

67
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,021
The basic goal is to make as much money as possible

68
00:03:58,021 --> 00:04:01,063
and then you eventually win by taking that money

69
00:04:01,063 --> 00:04:03,065
and buying up the stock of your opponents.

70
00:04:04,928 --> 00:04:08,570
So to talk about how I got here, I first want to talk about the

71
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,533
games that influenced me to get to off world. Because even

72
00:04:12,533 --> 00:04:16,116
though off world is a pretty unusual game, there's not really

73
00:04:16,116 --> 00:04:19,738
another, economic RTS is sort of a subgenre I basically invented

74
00:04:19,738 --> 00:04:23,081
here. It actually has a lot of antecedents. Pretty much almost

75
00:04:23,081 --> 00:04:27,244
every element of the game was taken from other games. Almost

76
00:04:27,244 --> 00:04:29,886
everything in it is actually recognizable, it just hasn't

77
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:33,428
been together in this specific assortment.

78
00:04:34,069 --> 00:04:39,350
So here's Belter. It's a very, very old hex encounter war game

79
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:43,951
from 1979. And it's a game I played as a kid. And it's what

80
00:04:43,951 --> 00:04:48,952
first introduced the idea of going out, exploring,

81
00:04:48,952 --> 00:04:52,673
discovering resources and them having sort of different levels.

82
00:04:52,673 --> 00:04:55,974
So in Belter you would go from asteroid to asteroid and you'd

83
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:59,134
roll a dice and you'd discover if it had low or medium or high

84
00:04:59,134 --> 00:05:02,195
iron or gas or whatever. And that's where I got the basic

85
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:03,635
idea for resources in Offworld.

86
00:05:05,117 --> 00:05:10,043
Mule is pretty obvious influence on off world. That's

87
00:05:10,043 --> 00:05:17,551
where I got the basic idea for claims. And mule had limited

88
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:19,213
claims which is really important. Like in a

89
00:05:19,213 --> 00:05:22,657
traditional RTS, you're able to gather resources anywhere.

90
00:05:22,657 --> 00:05:23,919
There's really no limitation on it.

91
00:05:24,279 --> 00:05:27,402
where as in Mule you get a new claim every turn.

92
00:05:27,402 --> 00:05:29,444
And that's really what makes the game interesting

93
00:05:29,444 --> 00:05:31,346
because you have to make a tough choice of

94
00:05:31,346 --> 00:05:33,588
are you going to invest in food or smith ore

95
00:05:33,588 --> 00:05:35,149
or energy or whatever.

96
00:05:35,149 --> 00:05:38,473
And I wanted that same mechanic in Offworld.

97
00:05:39,968 --> 00:05:45,774
and I also borrowed auctions from Mule because it was such an

98
00:05:45,774 --> 00:05:49,798
important part of the game. Our auctions work very differently.

99
00:05:49,798 --> 00:05:52,140
They are much more like traditional auctions. But

100
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:55,263
basically after playing Mule, I knew that we had to have

101
00:05:55,263 --> 00:05:56,965
auctions. It was such a cool thing to have.

102
00:06:00,457 --> 00:06:03,679
Board games have influenced Offworld a lot, obviously,

103
00:06:03,679 --> 00:06:04,720
for people who've played it.

104
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,621
They often, I often hear that, you know,

105
00:06:07,621 --> 00:06:08,962
Offworld feels like, you know,

106
00:06:08,962 --> 00:06:09,963
a board game that's on your computer,

107
00:06:09,963 --> 00:06:12,704
it's like one that would be like way too complex to play,

108
00:06:12,704 --> 00:06:14,485
but it still feels like a board game,

109
00:06:14,485 --> 00:06:15,666
which is interesting,

110
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:16,827
because people don't necessarily say that

111
00:06:16,827 --> 00:06:18,047
about other RTS games.

112
00:06:18,047 --> 00:06:19,888
And I think, I think the reason they do

113
00:06:19,888 --> 00:06:24,151
is because we really commit to transparency

114
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:25,391
in the rules in Offworld.

115
00:06:25,972 --> 00:06:28,996
So here, for example, I'm showing you some detail of how

116
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:30,338
a steel mine works.

117
00:06:30,338 --> 00:06:34,444
And it's showing that basically you put in one unit of iron in

118
00:06:34,444 --> 00:06:37,248
one side and then out the other side comes half a unit of

119
00:06:37,248 --> 00:06:39,911
steel. And all of the buildings in Alfa World basically work

120
00:06:39,911 --> 00:06:41,634
like that. They're very chunky.

121
00:06:42,214 --> 00:06:46,559
on the map there, you see those little cubes that represent

122
00:06:46,559 --> 00:06:49,763
iron. You don't have to take a big jump to think of all those

123
00:06:49,763 --> 00:06:52,386
sort of your games with little wooden cubes that you tend to

124
00:06:52,386 --> 00:06:55,370
have. So we definitely wanted to give people that feeling.

125
00:06:56,898 --> 00:07:01,339
Railroad tycoon is another huge influence on us. And that was

126
00:07:01,339 --> 00:07:05,100
where I kind of got the concept of your shipping lanes. That

127
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,262
there's sort of a geographical element of, you know, you have

128
00:07:11,262 --> 00:07:14,163
a base somewhere and then you go out and get your resources and

129
00:07:14,163 --> 00:07:16,324
then you ship them around. You get iron from one place, you

130
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:18,464
take it here, you turn it into steel and you do something with

131
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:21,185
that. You get water from one place, you take it here, you

132
00:07:21,185 --> 00:07:23,746
turn it into fuel, then you take the fuel and you turn it into

133
00:07:23,746 --> 00:07:24,166
chemicals.

134
00:07:24,566 --> 00:07:28,072
So indeed, you got to talk about this here, which is the

135
00:07:28,072 --> 00:07:31,737
resource chart in Railroad Tycoon, which is another really

136
00:07:31,737 --> 00:07:34,501
big core part of Offworld, is all of this arrangement, how you

137
00:07:34,501 --> 00:07:38,808
turn resources into each one, turn one resource into another.

138
00:07:40,562 --> 00:07:45,483
As an aside, I spent a long time online trying to find a resource

139
00:07:45,483 --> 00:07:48,244
chart for the original railroad tycoon and the only one I could

140
00:07:48,244 --> 00:07:52,466
find was in German. Which I think is very telling because if

141
00:07:52,466 --> 00:07:55,467
you know Germans, the only thing better than a game where you can

142
00:07:55,467 --> 00:07:58,268
turn wheat into bread is a game in which you first get to turn

143
00:07:58,268 --> 00:08:00,068
it into flour and then you turn it into bread.

144
00:08:01,249 --> 00:08:03,290
So this is their type of game.

145
00:08:03,290 --> 00:08:07,793
And this is what the resource chart looks like in off world.

146
00:08:07,793 --> 00:08:12,396
So actually it's almost the same number of types of

147
00:08:12,396 --> 00:08:14,197
buildings and types of resources and conversions.

148
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:17,138
And some are a little more complex than others.

149
00:08:17,138 --> 00:08:20,600
The electronics factory requires three inputs.

150
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,781
Some spit out two inputs.

151
00:08:21,781 --> 00:08:25,764
The reactor takes water and splits it into oxygen fuel,

152
00:08:25,764 --> 00:08:28,625
which creates some interesting dynamics in the system.

153
00:08:29,826 --> 00:08:31,696
But here's actually the big one.

154
00:08:31,696 --> 00:08:33,726
It's Age of Empires.

155
00:08:34,739 --> 00:08:39,901
And specifically, there's just one building in Age of Empires

156
00:08:39,901 --> 00:08:44,082
that has a huge influence on off world. And that building is the

157
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:47,003
market, which you can see here kind of on the left side of the

158
00:08:47,003 --> 00:08:50,285
screen. In fact, it's selected, so you can see in the bottom

159
00:08:50,285 --> 00:08:53,686
left corner of the screen there's this interface, which I

160
00:08:53,686 --> 00:08:58,067
want to zoom in here. So this is the market building where you

161
00:08:58,067 --> 00:09:02,469
can, there's four resources in Age of Empires. Food, wood,

162
00:09:02,469 --> 00:09:02,809
stone, gold.

163
00:09:03,029 --> 00:09:06,252
and using the market you can trade any of those resources at

164
00:09:06,252 --> 00:09:11,076
any time for using gold. And the wonderful thing about this

165
00:09:11,076 --> 00:09:14,219
system is that the prices are global. So...

166
00:09:15,185 --> 00:09:18,767
you know, I start buying wood, I get wood, but the price goes

167
00:09:18,767 --> 00:09:21,609
up for everyone. So if someone out there notices that the

168
00:09:21,609 --> 00:09:23,790
price of wood has gotten really high, they can start taking

169
00:09:23,790 --> 00:09:25,971
advantage of that. They can produce a lot of wood, turn it

170
00:09:25,971 --> 00:09:28,752
to gold, and gold is really valuable in nature empires. You

171
00:09:28,752 --> 00:09:31,514
can, you know, some of the most powerful units like knights are

172
00:09:31,514 --> 00:09:34,255
made with gold. So they can really take advantage of this

173
00:09:34,255 --> 00:09:38,398
sort of market inefficiency by turning basically something

174
00:09:38,398 --> 00:09:42,160
worthless like, not worthless, but less worthwhile, less

175
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:42,460
worthy.

176
00:09:44,170 --> 00:09:47,914
whatever that word is, taking that wood, turning it into gold,

177
00:09:47,914 --> 00:09:51,578
turning it into a really powerful unit. So you can see

178
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:55,983
there's kind of a direct line here from the market in Age of

179
00:09:55,983 --> 00:09:59,266
Empires right to our resource market in Offworld. In many

180
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:03,571
ways you can say that we made an entire game about just this one

181
00:10:03,571 --> 00:10:05,153
building in Age of Empires.

182
00:10:05,773 --> 00:10:11,355
and there's something interesting I'd like to note,

183
00:10:11,355 --> 00:10:16,137
which is you see there's actually two prices there, right?

184
00:10:16,137 --> 00:10:17,737
So you can sell wood for 76 gold,

185
00:10:17,737 --> 00:10:19,057
and you have to spend 142 to buy it.

186
00:10:19,057 --> 00:10:21,538
So they're actually kind of like,

187
00:10:21,538 --> 00:10:24,499
they're hedging their bets, basically.

188
00:10:24,499 --> 00:10:28,660
They're doubling the price to make sure people don't.

189
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:32,504
do too much trading. It's an interesting part of the game,

190
00:10:32,504 --> 00:10:35,546
but it's just something to the side. It's a supplement to the

191
00:10:35,546 --> 00:10:40,549
main game. They didn't want this part of the game to take over by

192
00:10:40,549 --> 00:10:43,450
having those two prices, the buy and sell price, be too close.

193
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:47,793
And when I first made off world, I actually just adopted what

194
00:10:47,793 --> 00:10:51,815
they did. I had the buy and sell price be, I'd have the buy price

195
00:10:51,815 --> 00:10:53,756
be double the sell price. And

196
00:10:54,477 --> 00:10:57,578
it wasn't really interesting. The game never really took off

197
00:10:57,578 --> 00:11:00,220
internally when we were playing until I decided I don't know if

198
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:02,301
this is working. I just collapsed the price into one

199
00:11:02,301 --> 00:11:05,743
price. So when you buy it and sell it, it's the same price.

200
00:11:05,743 --> 00:11:07,804
And then the game suddenly became so much more interesting

201
00:11:07,804 --> 00:11:11,386
because then there were so many new ways to get an advantage

202
00:11:11,386 --> 00:11:15,948
off of the market. At that point it was all about arbitrage. The

203
00:11:15,948 --> 00:11:19,550
market could change within a few seconds and you can make

204
00:11:19,950 --> 00:11:22,593
you can make a huge profit off of something very quickly.

205
00:11:22,593 --> 00:11:25,195
Where here, you buy wood for $142,

206
00:11:25,195 --> 00:11:26,956
you're going to have to wait a long time

207
00:11:26,956 --> 00:11:28,197
for the price to get high enough

208
00:11:28,197 --> 00:11:31,039
for you to make sense to actually sell it.

209
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:33,061
You probably are never going to be able

210
00:11:33,061 --> 00:11:35,583
to make money that way.

211
00:11:35,583 --> 00:11:38,545
So, collapsing into one price made a huge difference.

212
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:42,588
All right, so but why build a game

213
00:11:42,588 --> 00:11:44,310
around a free market at all?

214
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:48,433
And for me it comes down to,

215
00:11:49,935 --> 00:11:53,277
what I call adaptive game play. Adaptive game play means you

216
00:11:53,277 --> 00:11:56,718
are adapting your strategy to the current environment, which

217
00:11:56,718 --> 00:12:01,779
is really the core of strategy gaming. There is not one choice.

218
00:12:01,779 --> 00:12:05,741
This is an RPG. We are not letting you decide how you want

219
00:12:05,741 --> 00:12:09,822
to play the game. The whole point is to see what environment

220
00:12:09,822 --> 00:12:12,983
the game is presenting to you and then try to make the best

221
00:12:12,983 --> 00:12:14,804
choice depending upon that.

222
00:12:14,864 --> 00:12:18,405
that's adaptation. And I think all good strategy games have

223
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:22,526
that. And I want to kind of go into all of the things in off

224
00:12:22,526 --> 00:12:26,608
world that enable that. And a lot of these things you'll see

225
00:12:26,608 --> 00:12:29,429
come back to a free market. So, you know, number one, you got

226
00:12:29,429 --> 00:12:33,090
the random maps. Right? And different type of train favor

227
00:12:33,090 --> 00:12:35,771
different types of resources. So you might have some maps where

228
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:38,612
there's a lot of iron and very little water. Or you might have

229
00:12:38,612 --> 00:12:40,932
another map where there's the reverse. And that totally

230
00:12:40,932 --> 00:12:42,373
changes the dynamics in the market.

231
00:12:42,713 --> 00:12:47,498
If you see a map where there's very little water,

232
00:12:47,498 --> 00:12:50,621
then you want to make sure that you monopolize that early.

233
00:12:50,621 --> 00:12:52,643
Maybe you try to grab up as much of the water as possible

234
00:12:52,643 --> 00:12:54,825
because you know that by the end of the game,

235
00:12:54,825 --> 00:12:58,089
the prices of all the life support materials

236
00:12:58,089 --> 00:12:59,110
are going to be super high,

237
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:01,993
and everyone's going to have to buy that from you.

238
00:13:01,993 --> 00:13:04,035
We have random events in the game.

239
00:13:04,035 --> 00:13:04,636
You see on the...

240
00:13:05,741 --> 00:13:08,703
On the left there, there's a fuel shortage and an iron

241
00:13:08,703 --> 00:13:11,505
shortage, which is causing sort of like a temporary spike in

242
00:13:11,505 --> 00:13:14,327
price for those resources. On the right, there's an oxygen

243
00:13:14,327 --> 00:13:17,850
surplus and a chemical surplus, which is sort of doing the

244
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:21,873
opposite. So these are other things that can sort of mix up

245
00:13:21,873 --> 00:13:24,995
the supply-demand ratio on the market.

246
00:13:26,684 --> 00:13:30,467
we introduced random prices for when the game begins.

247
00:13:30,467 --> 00:13:33,849
On the left side, those are kind of what you'd say

248
00:13:33,849 --> 00:13:36,611
are the base prices for all the resources.

249
00:13:36,611 --> 00:13:38,632
So you know, kind of the more advanced resources

250
00:13:38,632 --> 00:13:41,574
like electronics and glass started out more expensive.

251
00:13:41,574 --> 00:13:43,836
Things like water and...

252
00:13:44,216 --> 00:13:45,697
iron and aluminum, things you can just get

253
00:13:45,697 --> 00:13:48,317
straight from the ground, start out cheaper.

254
00:13:48,317 --> 00:13:50,338
And so, at some point I was like,

255
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:51,999
well I feel like I really want to

256
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:53,419
have the game a little more variety,

257
00:13:53,419 --> 00:13:56,140
make the game have a little more variety because

258
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,621
when the game starts with the same prices,

259
00:13:57,621 --> 00:13:59,982
you kind of end up always starting with the same buildings,

260
00:13:59,982 --> 00:14:01,842
you know, based off of that kind of dynamic.

261
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:04,603
And so I was like, well let's just roll the dice

262
00:14:04,603 --> 00:14:06,424
and see what the prices are.

263
00:14:06,424 --> 00:14:08,745
And so I did what you see there in the middle column,

264
00:14:08,745 --> 00:14:09,945
whereas I just said, you know,

265
00:14:09,945 --> 00:14:11,166
kind of prices all over the place.

266
00:14:11,586 --> 00:14:15,910
And that sort of works at a high level.

267
00:14:15,910 --> 00:14:18,392
It definitely made the game have more variety

268
00:14:18,392 --> 00:14:20,614
because things were very, very different.

269
00:14:20,614 --> 00:14:23,456
But the problem was there was too much cognitive load

270
00:14:23,456 --> 00:14:25,057
on the player when the game began.

271
00:14:25,057 --> 00:14:26,919
You know, they look at that chart of numbers

272
00:14:26,919 --> 00:14:28,040
and it's just kind of like,

273
00:14:28,040 --> 00:14:29,781
it's just a mishmash of numbers.

274
00:14:31,463 --> 00:14:35,465
it's hard to process all at once. So what we did instead is

275
00:14:35,465 --> 00:14:39,987
what you see in the right column, which is that we either

276
00:14:39,987 --> 00:14:43,109
double a resource, the double resources price or half it. And

277
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:46,490
then we also give a little colored hint. So you can see

278
00:14:46,490 --> 00:14:48,832
immediately when you see that, when the game starts, this is

279
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:51,293
exactly what the market is going to look like. You click quickly

280
00:14:51,293 --> 00:14:54,434
and you're like, oh, there's four resources, or double price

281
00:14:54,434 --> 00:14:55,735
and two resources are half price.

282
00:14:56,235 --> 00:14:59,517
you know, and that can hugely affect, you know, how you want

283
00:14:59,517 --> 00:15:02,639
to start. So here you see iron is green, it's 40 bucks, that

284
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:05,600
means it's double price. So you might want to grab two iron

285
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,582
tiles instead of one at the beginning of the game. Here's

286
00:15:09,582 --> 00:15:12,484
another thing, random auctions. So over the course of the game,

287
00:15:12,484 --> 00:15:16,626
you know, usually every 24 hours basically, you get an auction

288
00:15:16,626 --> 00:15:19,447
comes up and that can be for a patent, it can be for a tile, it

289
00:15:19,447 --> 00:15:23,269
can be for something on the black market. And that's an

290
00:15:23,269 --> 00:15:25,410
interesting, you know, sort of

291
00:15:25,550 --> 00:15:29,472
the game can throw at you because the players can't

292
00:15:29,472 --> 00:15:32,413
anticipate what's going to come up. What you're seeing here is

293
00:15:32,413 --> 00:15:36,634
some fan art that was made based off of a game that's become

294
00:15:36,634 --> 00:15:40,215
infamous among our community. It was from a tournament where two

295
00:15:40,215 --> 00:15:42,836
players both started the game where due to random prices,

296
00:15:42,836 --> 00:15:46,217
steel was like I think double price and iron was half price.

297
00:15:46,217 --> 00:15:48,618
So they both were going to be very clever and just build three

298
00:15:48,618 --> 00:15:51,439
steel mills to take advantage of that, you know,

299
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,061
price discrepancy and just create a lot of steel. But

300
00:15:54,061 --> 00:15:58,143
since they both did that, it basically drove the price of

301
00:15:58,143 --> 00:16:02,325
iron up so high that then the steel mills became unprofitable.

302
00:16:02,325 --> 00:16:04,987
And basically both players got stuck. They couldn't even

303
00:16:04,987 --> 00:16:07,368
upgrade. They were both just sitting there kind of like

304
00:16:07,368 --> 00:16:10,650
waiting like, well, what should happen now? And what the game

305
00:16:10,650 --> 00:16:13,292
decided to let happen was suddenly auction off a high iron

306
00:16:13,292 --> 00:16:13,512
tile.

307
00:16:14,993 --> 00:16:18,555
and that was it basically.

308
00:16:18,555 --> 00:16:23,537
It's like well whoever gets this tile wins the game I guess.

309
00:16:23,537 --> 00:16:25,258
So the auction kept going up and up and up

310
00:16:25,258 --> 00:16:26,719
and just for reference here,

311
00:16:26,719 --> 00:16:29,260
a typical auction usually goes from maybe 20,000,

312
00:16:29,260 --> 00:16:31,261
maybe 30,000 if it's something really desirable.

313
00:16:31,261 --> 00:16:31,701
So it went up to 60,000, 90, 98, 128.

314
00:16:32,462 --> 00:16:38,246
192 and eventually one guy got it for $224,000. And just for

315
00:16:38,246 --> 00:16:41,609
reference, if you have in a two player game, if you have $400,000

316
00:16:41,609 --> 00:16:43,590
you can probably just win the game at that point. That's

317
00:16:43,590 --> 00:16:48,234
probably enough to win. So he got the high iron tile, but this

318
00:16:48,234 --> 00:16:51,156
is what you call the winner's curse at an auction. He spent so

319
00:16:51,156 --> 00:16:53,378
much that when you spend that much it goes directly into your

320
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:56,720
debt and his basically his stock price immediately collapsed to

321
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:56,780
$1. And...

322
00:16:59,162 --> 00:17:01,684
and the other player won just by basically buying them out.

323
00:17:01,684 --> 00:17:04,026
So the thing here is they just said

324
00:17:04,026 --> 00:17:06,747
they had never been in this situation before

325
00:17:06,747 --> 00:17:09,229
of like how do we value this high iron tile?

326
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:11,551
There is some correct price.

327
00:17:11,551 --> 00:17:14,793
It was probably maybe 90,000 would be my guess,

328
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:16,174
but I'm not sure, you know,

329
00:17:16,174 --> 00:17:18,255
it's just you gotta figure it out as the game goes, right?

330
00:17:18,255 --> 00:17:20,837
And that's what's great about adaptive gameplay, right?

331
00:17:20,837 --> 00:17:22,518
You know, you have to, you know,

332
00:17:22,518 --> 00:17:23,919
this is this unusual situation,

333
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:25,240
you gotta figure it out on the fly.

334
00:17:27,411 --> 00:17:30,354
So here's the black market. These are a bunch of items that can

335
00:17:30,354 --> 00:17:33,338
basically mess with your opponents. Things like EMP

336
00:17:33,338 --> 00:17:35,901
which knocks out their buildings or mutiny where you literally

337
00:17:35,901 --> 00:17:38,644
steal their buildings. Dynamite where you blow up their

338
00:17:38,644 --> 00:17:42,068
buildings. You get the drift. There's some positive ones here

339
00:17:42,068 --> 00:17:44,791
like an adrenaline boost that makes your stuff go faster.

340
00:17:46,419 --> 00:17:49,442
But, you know, like when we started out,

341
00:17:49,442 --> 00:17:51,424
we had maybe six or seven, and that seemed like fun.

342
00:17:51,424 --> 00:17:52,945
But it was like, well, we could push this more.

343
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:54,747
And so, you know, we eventually,

344
00:17:54,747 --> 00:17:56,789
we ship with maybe like 18 or 19 effects.

345
00:17:56,789 --> 00:17:58,271
And, you know, that's an obvious place

346
00:17:58,271 --> 00:17:59,712
to basically mix things up each game.

347
00:17:59,712 --> 00:18:02,035
It's like there's a deck of black market items,

348
00:18:02,035 --> 00:18:03,516
and you draw up seven each game.

349
00:18:04,978 --> 00:18:07,920
whatever comes up can greatly influence how you want to play.

350
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:10,601
If a game has no pirates, that changes the dynamics.

351
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:15,284
Then it's safer to ship valuable resources over long distances

352
00:18:15,284 --> 00:18:17,265
because you know someone isn't going to be able to steal them

353
00:18:17,265 --> 00:18:20,867
from you. But here's the really big one, which is opponent

354
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:27,010
decisions. The choices the other players make in the game, you

355
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:30,952
start at one place, but the game ends in such a different place.

356
00:18:30,952 --> 00:18:32,753
We see a lot, you know,

357
00:18:33,643 --> 00:18:35,384
our community has a bunch of tournaments that they run kind

358
00:18:35,384 --> 00:18:38,405
of regularly. You'll often see these games where two players,

359
00:18:38,405 --> 00:18:40,406
you know, very high level players go against each other.

360
00:18:40,406 --> 00:18:43,107
The first game it ends very quickly in like four days with

361
00:18:43,107 --> 00:18:46,408
majority buyout. The next game it's this huge long affair, goes

362
00:18:46,408 --> 00:18:49,089
10, 12 days, ends with a bunch of off world markets, where the

363
00:18:49,089 --> 00:18:51,830
most advanced buildings. It all kind of goes back to kind of

364
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:55,431
these early decisions that those players meant that made the game

365
00:18:55,431 --> 00:18:57,492
spin off in these different directions.

366
00:18:59,458 --> 00:19:01,939
So put all these together, there's a lot of things that are

367
00:19:01,939 --> 00:19:05,422
different about each game of off world, which is how you get

368
00:19:05,422 --> 00:19:10,125
such high replayability. And so talking about opponent choices,

369
00:19:10,125 --> 00:19:13,487
one of the real big ones here is when you found your

370
00:19:13,487 --> 00:19:13,947
headquarters.

371
00:19:14,507 --> 00:19:17,929
which of the four headquarter types, which is kind of like

372
00:19:17,929 --> 00:19:20,151
StarCraft, are you going to be Terran, are you going to be

373
00:19:20,151 --> 00:19:24,413
Zerg, are you going to be Protoss. But one thing that one

374
00:19:24,413 --> 00:19:27,776
of our testers came up with an idea early on in the project, he

375
00:19:27,776 --> 00:19:31,838
said, what if you chose your headquarters after the game

376
00:19:31,838 --> 00:19:34,300
began, right? So, you know, what if you chose your

377
00:19:34,833 --> 00:19:36,715
And that was great.

378
00:19:36,715 --> 00:19:38,696
That was sort of like a breakthrough idea

379
00:19:38,696 --> 00:19:42,460
because it, going back to the opponent decisions,

380
00:19:42,460 --> 00:19:45,002
you know, like that is such an important one,

381
00:19:45,002 --> 00:19:46,063
like what headquarters can be,

382
00:19:46,063 --> 00:19:47,765
because that radically changes the market.

383
00:19:47,765 --> 00:19:49,286
And I'll get to that in a little bit.

384
00:19:49,286 --> 00:19:50,687
But I just want to point out that,

385
00:19:50,687 --> 00:19:51,908
you know, when you work in a genre,

386
00:19:51,908 --> 00:19:55,772
sometimes you're not aware of the baggage you're inheriting.

387
00:19:55,772 --> 00:19:57,413
You know, I never really thought about like,

388
00:19:57,834 --> 00:19:59,935
well maybe you should pick your headquarter type after the game

389
00:19:59,935 --> 00:20:02,538
begins because every RTS you've ever played that's something you

390
00:20:02,538 --> 00:20:06,601
do in the set up screen. That's just sort of a given. And doing

391
00:20:06,601 --> 00:20:11,085
it this way was great. I mean, it was like that idea came up.

392
00:20:11,085 --> 00:20:13,367
You know, I implemented it that afternoon. We tried it right

393
00:20:13,367 --> 00:20:16,669
away and like immediately we knew that was what we wanted to

394
00:20:16,669 --> 00:20:20,853
do. So, the, what headquarters you choose is so important

395
00:20:20,853 --> 00:20:23,375
because it really radically alters your relationship to the

396
00:20:23,375 --> 00:20:23,615
market.

397
00:20:24,616 --> 00:20:27,519
The first one here is the expansive. They are sort of like

398
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:31,523
the vanilla HQ. They just have a lot of sort of straight forward

399
00:20:31,523 --> 00:20:37,269
bonuses. Makes them a good one for new players. But they are

400
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,532
not going to radically change the market unlike these guys,

401
00:20:40,532 --> 00:20:43,675
the robots. They don't consume any life support.

402
00:20:44,135 --> 00:20:47,497
and they ship, they use, instead of using fuel,

403
00:20:47,497 --> 00:20:50,599
they use power for their vehicles.

404
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,540
So that's obviously going to radically change the market.

405
00:20:52,540 --> 00:20:55,281
You know, you see there's a bunch of robots

406
00:20:55,281 --> 00:20:57,502
coming into the game, well probably the prices

407
00:20:57,502 --> 00:21:00,524
of food, oxygen, and fuel are not going to get all that high.

408
00:21:01,421 --> 00:21:05,064
Here's another big one. The scavengers, they use carbon

409
00:21:05,064 --> 00:21:07,265
instead of steel for their buildings and for upgrading

410
00:21:07,265 --> 00:21:10,167
their headquarters. Most everyone else uses steel. And

411
00:21:10,167 --> 00:21:15,111
steel is like the super key early game resource. When you're

412
00:21:15,111 --> 00:21:17,592
at level one, you almost certainly want to build some

413
00:21:17,592 --> 00:21:20,354
steel mills. And they kind of like, they're able to get around

414
00:21:20,354 --> 00:21:23,056
that. They can just focus on carbon. They can basically

415
00:21:23,056 --> 00:21:26,178
ignore iron entirely. So they're playing a game where they only

416
00:21:26,178 --> 00:21:29,541
care about four resources, which makes them potentially really

417
00:21:29,541 --> 00:21:30,161
powerful.

418
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:34,029
And then here's my favorite, headquarter type,

419
00:21:34,029 --> 00:21:34,830
the scientific.

420
00:21:34,830 --> 00:21:36,171
They're able to put their buildings

421
00:21:36,171 --> 00:21:38,013
directly on primary resources.

422
00:21:38,013 --> 00:21:43,478
So a farm, for example, turns water into food.

423
00:21:43,478 --> 00:21:46,461
Right, so for the scientists,

424
00:21:46,461 --> 00:21:48,864
they can just put their farms directly on the water.

425
00:21:48,864 --> 00:21:50,946
They don't need a water pump to make the water

426
00:21:50,946 --> 00:21:52,027
and then send it to the farm.

427
00:21:52,027 --> 00:21:53,528
They can just do it directly.

428
00:21:54,049 --> 00:21:56,090
So that changes the market too because they're not going to be

429
00:21:56,090 --> 00:22:00,012
producing primary resources which often end up flooding the

430
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:02,794
market by the end of the game. So there's actually a bit of an

431
00:22:02,794 --> 00:22:06,916
Achilles heel here for the scientists which is that if

432
00:22:06,916 --> 00:22:09,078
you're playing them, they probably don't have any iron

433
00:22:09,078 --> 00:22:13,500
mines, they probably don't have any water pumps. So if you're

434
00:22:13,500 --> 00:22:16,622
their opponent, you can start producing some water yourself.

435
00:22:16,622 --> 00:22:19,624
And I'm getting a little ahead of myself here because I'm going

436
00:22:19,624 --> 00:22:22,186
to be talking about the hack array. But that's a building

437
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:24,651
artificially create a water shortage.

438
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:26,656
So you can drive up the price of water

439
00:22:26,656 --> 00:22:28,861
and know you'll make a lot of money just yourself

440
00:22:28,861 --> 00:22:30,064
because you know that the scientist

441
00:22:30,064 --> 00:22:31,748
probably doesn't have any.

442
00:22:33,801 --> 00:22:36,182
Let me talk about some of the more advanced buildings in the

443
00:22:36,182 --> 00:22:40,402
game. This is the patent lab. This is the kind of like really

444
00:22:40,402 --> 00:22:45,084
unique technologies. Things like teleportation, so you don't need

445
00:22:45,084 --> 00:22:49,705
ships to move your goods around. Something like cold fusion lets

446
00:22:49,705 --> 00:22:54,126
you use water instead of power. Slant drilling is a neat one.

447
00:22:54,126 --> 00:22:57,006
It means you can get sort of the I drink your milkshake patent.

448
00:22:57,006 --> 00:23:00,627
You basically get to use the resources in tiles adjacent to

449
00:23:00,627 --> 00:23:03,468
yours. So if someone else got a monopoly on

450
00:23:04,789 --> 00:23:09,033
you can get slant drilling and claim a tile next to silicon

451
00:23:09,033 --> 00:23:13,758
and start mining his resource. It feels great. Each of these

452
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:16,361
has kind of like a really kind of strange interesting

453
00:23:16,361 --> 00:23:20,305
orthogonal effect. I was like, oh, it wouldn't be cool. A lot

454
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:23,268
of RTS games have these type of things, these technologies that

455
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:25,170
you resource, that you research.

456
00:23:25,630 --> 00:23:27,271
that change things about the game.

457
00:23:27,271 --> 00:23:29,373
And I thought I was going to be real clever

458
00:23:29,373 --> 00:23:31,994
and be like, oh, what if we make them patents

459
00:23:31,994 --> 00:23:34,716
so that when you research it, only you get it

460
00:23:34,716 --> 00:23:37,658
and everyone else is locked out from it.

461
00:23:37,658 --> 00:23:40,239
And so there's this race to get these patents

462
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:42,160
and like, oh wow, I came up with this awesome

463
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:42,861
new game mechanic.

464
00:23:42,861 --> 00:23:44,802
Except it sounds pretty familiar

465
00:23:44,802 --> 00:23:47,143
if you play the little game called Civ IV.

466
00:23:47,143 --> 00:23:50,085
Because I basically just re-implemented Wonders.

467
00:23:50,085 --> 00:23:50,905
I actually didn't even realize it.

468
00:23:50,905 --> 00:23:53,267
Someone just brought this up in a press interview.

469
00:23:53,267 --> 00:23:54,167
I'm like, oh yeah.

470
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:59,502
All right. I guess you're right. All right. So here's the hack

471
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:01,904
array which I mentioned earlier. This is a really neat one. I

472
00:24:01,904 --> 00:24:05,446
love this building. So I showed you there were the shortages and

473
00:24:05,446 --> 00:24:08,068
surpluses that happened in the game. Those happen randomly.

474
00:24:08,068 --> 00:24:11,590
There's just a little RNG thing in the background that kind of

475
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:14,552
rolls every once in a while and decides what's going to happen.

476
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:17,813
But with a hack array, you can basically trigger these things

477
00:24:17,813 --> 00:24:21,256
artificially. So you can create, for example, an aluminum

478
00:24:21,256 --> 00:24:21,696
shortage.

479
00:24:22,415 --> 00:24:25,679
you find out that it's coming and then the aluminum shortage

480
00:24:25,679 --> 00:24:28,202
happens. But the other players have no idea whether was this a

481
00:24:28,202 --> 00:24:31,306
real aluminum shortage or an artificial one. The effect is

482
00:24:31,306 --> 00:24:36,753
the same, but the trick is if you find out someone is

483
00:24:36,753 --> 00:24:39,357
artificially shorting aluminum, they're probably doing that

484
00:24:39,357 --> 00:24:41,119
because they bought up a huge stockpile of it.

485
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:44,381
and they're basically trying to drive up the price

486
00:24:44,381 --> 00:24:45,582
to take advantage of that.

487
00:24:45,582 --> 00:24:48,483
And so you want to basically take an action against that.

488
00:24:48,483 --> 00:24:50,865
You either want to create your own aluminum surpluses

489
00:24:50,865 --> 00:24:52,225
or make sure you sell your own aluminum,

490
00:24:52,225 --> 00:24:54,847
drive the price down before they do.

491
00:24:54,847 --> 00:24:56,188
But I don't know, it's just a neat thing.

492
00:24:56,188 --> 00:24:57,068
Creates a lot of paranoia.

493
00:24:58,369 --> 00:25:01,090
and we took it further in multiplayer so that when you put

494
00:25:01,090 --> 00:25:03,531
down a hacker array, it's covered with a hologram, which

495
00:25:03,531 --> 00:25:06,331
basically makes it look like another building. So you're not

496
00:25:06,331 --> 00:25:09,473
even aware if your opponents have hacker arrays. So you get a

497
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:12,113
lot of people talking back and forth when the game goes, like

498
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:14,234
when you see a shortage, you're like, oh, is that a real one or

499
00:25:14,234 --> 00:25:18,276
a fake one? And the gig gets sort of up when the same shortage

500
00:25:18,276 --> 00:25:21,477
happens like twice in a row. Then you're like, oh, okay, he's

501
00:25:21,477 --> 00:25:21,977
going for it.

502
00:25:24,056 --> 00:25:27,759
So let's talk about the black market. So I said there was no

503
00:25:27,759 --> 00:25:31,682
combat in the game. Maybe that's a lie because there's the black

504
00:25:31,682 --> 00:25:34,724
market. There is a way to kind of like blow up people's stuff

505
00:25:34,724 --> 00:25:39,447
and shoot down their blimps and do stuff like that. However,

506
00:25:39,447 --> 00:25:43,931
what I say is when we started the game, we kind of like

507
00:25:45,257 --> 00:25:48,958
We took out all of the zero sum combat mechanics.

508
00:25:48,958 --> 00:25:54,320
When you have tanks and barracks and military stuff,

509
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,961
that stuff tends to dominate,

510
00:25:56,961 --> 00:26:00,262
so we wanted to go to the other extreme.

511
00:26:00,262 --> 00:26:02,242
But once we went there, then we're like,

512
00:26:02,242 --> 00:26:03,843
well, maybe we can start introducing

513
00:26:03,843 --> 00:26:05,563
some of this stuff back into the game,

514
00:26:05,563 --> 00:26:07,244
but we just need to figure out a way

515
00:26:07,244 --> 00:26:09,265
to make sure it doesn't dominate.

516
00:26:09,625 --> 00:26:13,666
And what was neat about our solution was it actually

517
00:26:13,666 --> 00:26:16,207
kind of fits as sort of like a free market mechanic.

518
00:26:16,207 --> 00:26:19,208
Which is the idea here is you see each of those

519
00:26:19,208 --> 00:26:22,370
black market items has a different price.

520
00:26:22,370 --> 00:26:26,611
Like you see pirates there, the second on the left

521
00:26:26,611 --> 00:26:26,871
is $6,000.

522
00:26:26,871 --> 00:26:29,872
And so what happens here is if I buy pirates,

523
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:32,793
the price goes up, and it goes up for everyone in the game.

524
00:26:32,994 --> 00:26:37,438
So if I buy it for 6,000, then the next person will have to buy it for 10,000, and then the

525
00:26:37,438 --> 00:26:40,841
next person after that will have to buy it for 16,000, and then it'll be 25,000. And

526
00:26:40,841 --> 00:26:44,844
eventually the price will get high enough that it just doesn't make sense to buy pirates

527
00:26:44,844 --> 00:26:50,309
anymore. And that basically solved the problem, because you know each of these black

528
00:26:50,309 --> 00:26:53,732
market items is only going to get used so many times in the game.

529
00:26:54,153 --> 00:26:58,518
and it also has this nice side effect of when you saw the

530
00:26:58,518 --> 00:27:03,604
price go up, that means you know your opponent just bought one.

531
00:27:03,604 --> 00:27:06,187
So if you saw that the price of dynamite just went up, then you

532
00:27:06,187 --> 00:27:09,250
know that he's probably going to do something with some dynamite,

533
00:27:09,250 --> 00:27:11,273
which might change what you decide to do.

534
00:27:15,263 --> 00:27:20,608
and we put in pirates. Pirates are a pretty interesting item on the black market because

535
00:27:20,608 --> 00:27:26,372
they allow you to actually steal a resource from another player. And actually in the

536
00:27:27,138 --> 00:27:29,338
In an early prototype, we did actually experiment

537
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:32,719
for a while with having pirates and that you could

538
00:27:32,719 --> 00:27:35,120
move around a map and basically place on people's

539
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,921
shipping lanes and those would blow up their ships

540
00:27:38,921 --> 00:27:39,661
and you get their stuff.

541
00:27:39,661 --> 00:27:41,302
But then we're like, well, we need something

542
00:27:41,302 --> 00:27:43,482
to counter the pirates, so okay, maybe we'll let you

543
00:27:43,482 --> 00:27:45,143
build police ships and then we'll fly the police ships

544
00:27:45,143 --> 00:27:47,783
over and the police ships will shoot down the pirates.

545
00:27:48,384 --> 00:27:50,345
and you know, it's kind of like, once you go down that road,

546
00:27:50,345 --> 00:27:51,705
it's kind of a slippery slope towards

547
00:27:51,705 --> 00:27:53,426
just making a regular RTS.

548
00:27:53,426 --> 00:27:56,808
So, and you know, without really enough benefit there,

549
00:27:56,808 --> 00:28:00,470
you know, like we're not differentiating ourselves enough

550
00:28:00,470 --> 00:28:02,352
and like that part of the game isn't ever going to be

551
00:28:02,352 --> 00:28:03,972
as fully featured as a real RTS.

552
00:28:03,972 --> 00:28:06,514
So eventually we just pulled it back to like,

553
00:28:06,514 --> 00:28:09,175
let's just turn this into this high level thing

554
00:28:09,175 --> 00:28:10,336
that you don't have to micromanage,

555
00:28:10,336 --> 00:28:12,577
just fire and forget, you just basically hit.

556
00:28:13,518 --> 00:28:15,439
click a tile, place down the pirates, they manage

557
00:28:15,439 --> 00:28:17,881
themselves and they basically steal X number of units and

558
00:28:17,881 --> 00:28:21,003
then they go away. And then it was, it kind of fit the game

559
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:21,583
again at that point.

560
00:28:24,818 --> 00:28:27,620
All right, so another cool thing on the black market

561
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:29,301
are the holograms and spies.

562
00:28:29,301 --> 00:28:30,681
So you put a hologram down,

563
00:28:30,681 --> 00:28:33,143
and it basically makes your building look like

564
00:28:33,143 --> 00:28:34,964
one of the other buildings that's adjacent to it.

565
00:28:34,964 --> 00:28:36,965
And the typical building you want to hide

566
00:28:36,965 --> 00:28:37,706
is the off-world market,

567
00:28:37,706 --> 00:28:39,367
because that's sort of the most powerful building

568
00:28:39,367 --> 00:28:39,727
of the game.

569
00:28:39,727 --> 00:28:41,668
It's kind of the end-game building that you use

570
00:28:41,668 --> 00:28:43,209
to ship resources off-world,

571
00:28:43,209 --> 00:28:44,910
where the prices are very high,

572
00:28:44,910 --> 00:28:46,491
and they're also constant.

573
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:49,133
They don't really go down from oversupplying the market.

574
00:28:49,213 --> 00:28:51,835
you can sometimes you see in games people will oversupply

575
00:28:51,835 --> 00:28:54,598
the market on Mars which will drive the prices down and then

576
00:28:54,598 --> 00:28:56,460
the only way to basically end the game is to go off world.

577
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,402
So because of the black market you really want to hide your

578
00:28:59,402 --> 00:29:00,603
off world market.

579
00:29:00,603 --> 00:29:02,765
So you want to put a hologram on it right?

580
00:29:02,765 --> 00:29:06,068
And then the counter for that is either you know watching the

581
00:29:06,068 --> 00:29:08,591
other player really closely or you place down spies and the

582
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:11,353
spies will kind of reveal holograms within a certain

583
00:29:11,353 --> 00:29:13,655
range so you have a little thing going back and forth

584
00:29:13,655 --> 00:29:15,117
between how those two things work together.

585
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:19,941
However, I made a choice early on, as soon as I thought of the

586
00:29:19,941 --> 00:29:22,744
idea, I was like, oh, that sounds great, but it will never

587
00:29:22,744 --> 00:29:29,230
work in single player. Like people, because basically,

588
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:34,515
basically it's like a, it's a catch 22 for the AI. There's no

589
00:29:34,515 --> 00:29:38,319
way you can write an AI to handle holograms and spies.

590
00:29:39,085 --> 00:29:42,289
Let's say, first of all, you might just do a bad job. It's

591
00:29:42,289 --> 00:29:46,213
hard to do. So you might just do a bad job writing the AI, which

592
00:29:46,213 --> 00:29:48,516
is not good, obviously. But what if you do a good job?

593
00:29:49,044 --> 00:29:52,085
If you do a good job having the AI be able to identify where

594
00:29:52,085 --> 00:29:55,066
holograms are, and they're able to figure out where you tend to

595
00:29:55,066 --> 00:29:58,707
put holograms and they're able to target your buildings because

596
00:29:58,707 --> 00:30:01,667
they guessed right, people are just not going to believe that

597
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:05,468
the AI played fairly. I can tell you from years of experience

598
00:30:05,468 --> 00:30:09,369
working on AI, that's exactly what's going to happen. So it's

599
00:30:09,369 --> 00:30:14,111
a lose-lose situation. There's no way to make people believe

600
00:30:14,111 --> 00:30:17,331
the AI. Players don't trust the AI and they find cheats even

601
00:30:17,331 --> 00:30:17,891
when there aren't any.

602
00:30:18,595 --> 00:30:23,378
However, I really like the idea, so I just said, well, let's just

603
00:30:23,378 --> 00:30:26,340
try adding something that's multiplayer only. And it works

604
00:30:26,340 --> 00:30:29,101
great in multiplayer. It's not a problem in single player. And I

605
00:30:29,101 --> 00:30:33,263
guess maybe that's okay. Something I hadn't really tried

606
00:30:33,263 --> 00:30:35,885
all that much before in other games I made were single player

607
00:30:35,885 --> 00:30:39,327
or multiplayer, where we tried to make it basically the same.

608
00:30:40,709 --> 00:30:43,432
Okay. I think the real crucial piece to make the whole black

609
00:30:43,432 --> 00:30:46,114
market work. So black market was fun. Got in the game, people

610
00:30:46,114 --> 00:30:49,657
were having fun with it. But there was still a sense of like

611
00:30:49,657 --> 00:30:53,401
you know, I lost the game because I got EMP too much or my

612
00:30:53,401 --> 00:30:55,723
buildings got mutiny at a key time and there was nothing I

613
00:30:55,723 --> 00:30:56,463
could do.

614
00:30:56,844 --> 00:30:59,325
once the opponent tried to hit me, there was absolutely

615
00:30:59,325 --> 00:31:02,087
nothing I could do. So we introduced the goon squad,

616
00:31:02,087 --> 00:31:05,749
which will protect you from sabotage. So you put a goon

617
00:31:05,749 --> 00:31:09,991
squad on your off-road market, someone tries to dynamite it,

618
00:31:09,991 --> 00:31:11,892
it's blocked. However, it's not just blocked.

619
00:31:12,178 --> 00:31:15,140
the person you try to attack with the dynamite gets your

620
00:31:15,140 --> 00:31:18,462
dynamite. And also normally when you attack someone with a

621
00:31:18,462 --> 00:31:21,544
black market, you don't know who attacked you. That's a

622
00:31:21,544 --> 00:31:24,866
hidden information. When you attack someone with a goon

623
00:31:24,866 --> 00:31:27,587
squad, that information is announced for everyone. And we

624
00:31:27,587 --> 00:31:30,989
found that humans are surprisingly very vindictive.

625
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:34,730
If someone blows up my off world market, or tries to,

626
00:31:34,730 --> 00:31:36,731
and I find out because of a goon squad,

627
00:31:36,731 --> 00:31:38,491
there's a pretty good chance I'm gonna take that dynamite

628
00:31:38,491 --> 00:31:39,471
and hit that person back.

629
00:31:39,471 --> 00:31:41,712
Even if that's not the best move for me to make,

630
00:31:41,712 --> 00:31:43,692
it just feels good, and you just do it, and that's that.

631
00:31:43,692 --> 00:31:46,293
But the real thing about the goon squad

632
00:31:46,293 --> 00:31:49,613
is it's not actually, because there's only gonna be

633
00:31:49,613 --> 00:31:51,634
so many goon squads bought in the course of a game,

634
00:31:51,634 --> 00:31:53,914
it's price goes up just like all the black market items.

635
00:31:53,914 --> 00:31:56,395
It's the threat of a goon squad that's important.

636
00:31:56,395 --> 00:31:58,335
The fact that you know,

637
00:31:58,375 --> 00:31:59,636
the player could put it down,

638
00:31:59,636 --> 00:32:01,256
and the effects of hitting a goon squad

639
00:32:01,256 --> 00:32:02,277
are so devastating.

640
00:32:02,277 --> 00:32:04,517
So, it turns into this mind game.

641
00:32:04,517 --> 00:32:06,458
Surely, someone wouldn't be dumb enough

642
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:09,079
to build a geotherm so early and not goon squad it.

643
00:32:09,079 --> 00:32:11,740
Of course, then you're tempted to not goon squad it

644
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:15,401
because they never think you would not goon squad it.

645
00:32:15,401 --> 00:32:16,322
Anyway, it's fun.

646
00:32:16,322 --> 00:32:20,983
All right, I wanna talk about the stock market a little bit.

647
00:32:22,212 --> 00:32:26,377
early on, the way it works, you buy into other opponents, you buy into your opponents and at

648
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,100
some point you have enough money to buy them out and you buy them out, you actually get all

649
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:32,784
their stuff. You get their headquarters, you get all their buildings, you get everything. And

650
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:38,190
that worked okay, but the problem was it was just too much for most players to handle. It was

651
00:32:38,190 --> 00:32:41,874
just like I got all this new stuff, I don't understand it, I don't know how it works. And in

652
00:32:41,874 --> 00:32:43,456
an 8 player game, it was...

653
00:32:43,676 --> 00:32:49,017
absolutely insane. So we want to try something different. So we

654
00:32:49,017 --> 00:32:53,539
try what we call a subsidiary system where once a player gets

655
00:32:53,539 --> 00:32:56,699
bought out, they basically get taken over by a very

656
00:32:56,699 --> 00:33:00,340
conservative AI that runs the company to make money and that

657
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:02,841
money is distributed to their owners. So in this case you see

658
00:33:02,841 --> 00:33:04,562
the subsidiary here is King Morgan.

659
00:33:04,982 --> 00:33:09,526
he's owned partially by blue and partially by green so his money gets split between them.

660
00:33:09,526 --> 00:33:13,089
And that worked great. It also had the big advantage of buying out a player was no

661
00:33:13,089 --> 00:33:17,473
longer all or nothing. We had this problem before where if there were two people A and B

662
00:33:17,473 --> 00:33:21,757
were competing to buy out C, whoever ends up winning that battle, there's a pretty good

663
00:33:21,757 --> 00:33:25,200
chance they're going to end up winning the game. Whereas here, both of those players were

664
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:29,004
aiming to get King Morgan, they both got half of them, they're both kind of like in a good

665
00:33:29,004 --> 00:33:30,805
position to continue on to win the game.

666
00:33:32,156 --> 00:33:33,918
Here's another thing that we introduced after that,

667
00:33:33,918 --> 00:33:37,021
which was majority buyouts, which was this concept of

668
00:33:37,021 --> 00:33:40,063
once the other players got to own six of your shares,

669
00:33:40,063 --> 00:33:42,706
you're just immediately removed from the game.

670
00:33:42,706 --> 00:33:44,487
And you immediately become a subsidiary.

671
00:33:44,487 --> 00:33:46,589
This was important because there is sort of like

672
00:33:46,589 --> 00:33:48,971
a king-making problem in the game.

673
00:33:48,971 --> 00:33:51,613
We do support four-player, six-player,

674
00:33:51,613 --> 00:33:52,614
eight-player free-for-alls.

675
00:33:54,075 --> 00:33:56,358
If it's very clear a player is going to lose,

676
00:33:56,358 --> 00:33:58,320
you kind of want them eliminated as soon as possible.

677
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,862
Because you don't want them hanging around,

678
00:33:59,862 --> 00:34:01,143
buying things on the black market,

679
00:34:01,143 --> 00:34:02,324
messing with other players.

680
00:34:02,324 --> 00:34:03,906
You want to get them out of the game.

681
00:34:03,906 --> 00:34:05,948
Also, this created, kind of on accident,

682
00:34:05,948 --> 00:34:07,970
kind of like actually a rush boom turtle mechanic

683
00:34:07,970 --> 00:34:10,713
in the game in that the majority buyout

684
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:11,554
is sort of like the rush.

685
00:34:11,774 --> 00:34:12,935
you know, you're kind of putting in your money

686
00:34:12,935 --> 00:34:14,976
aggressively to take something out early.

687
00:34:14,976 --> 00:34:17,098
Whereas the total mechanic is you kind of buy up shares

688
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,139
of your own stock to protect yourself.

689
00:34:19,139 --> 00:34:22,421
And then the boom is basically, I'm going to take my money,

690
00:34:22,421 --> 00:34:24,222
I'm going to invest it in my own infrastructure

691
00:34:24,222 --> 00:34:28,225
to hopefully make more money in the long run.

692
00:34:28,225 --> 00:34:29,966
And it's funny how it just kind of worked naturally.

693
00:34:31,127 --> 00:34:33,369
Which basically led to, totally led to the idea

694
00:34:33,369 --> 00:34:35,933
of the locked shares, which is that once you get to,

695
00:34:35,933 --> 00:34:37,695
once you own five of your own shares of stock,

696
00:34:37,695 --> 00:34:39,857
they're kind of like all combined into one super share.

697
00:34:39,857 --> 00:34:41,499
And so that's a real key point in the game.

698
00:34:41,499 --> 00:34:43,422
You kind of want to get to those five shares,

699
00:34:43,422 --> 00:34:45,344
then you know you're safe from a majority buyout.

700
00:34:47,075 --> 00:34:52,516
this is masquerade mode. This is something that also came hand in hand with the black market

701
00:34:52,516 --> 00:34:56,817
once it came in the game. Which was this concept of you play a multiplayer, you get hit by the

702
00:34:56,817 --> 00:35:00,778
black market but there's a sense of like, oh, you hit me because you think I'm the best

703
00:35:00,778 --> 00:35:04,839
player or you think I'm the most threatening player or you just want to beat me because I

704
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:10,920
beat you last game and that's not fair. So at any rate, what, and I actually wasn't a fan of

705
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:16,161
this. This was my team. They really wanted to get in. They put it in on their own and it

706
00:35:16,161 --> 00:35:16,442
worked.

707
00:35:16,953 --> 00:35:19,155
So, you know, that's great.

708
00:35:19,155 --> 00:35:21,717
And the idea here is your identity is hidden.

709
00:35:21,717 --> 00:35:23,639
So here you see me, I'm one of the players,

710
00:35:23,639 --> 00:35:26,741
and then there's Clark and Herbert and Asimov,

711
00:35:26,741 --> 00:35:28,282
and those are, I don't know who those are.

712
00:35:28,282 --> 00:35:30,284
So you can't attack a specific player,

713
00:35:30,284 --> 00:35:32,806
you have to just kind of like attack the person

714
00:35:32,806 --> 00:35:34,968
who looks like him during the lead.

715
00:35:34,968 --> 00:35:36,189
And anyone who's played board games knows

716
00:35:36,189 --> 00:35:38,731
that this is a classic dynamic, you can get around the table.

717
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:40,753
Unfortunately, there's no way to hide people's identity

718
00:35:40,753 --> 00:35:43,295
in real life, but you can in an off world.

719
00:35:44,608 --> 00:35:55,736
So this is something we did here with multiplayer to kind of like, we're not, we don't have a huge user base, but the people who play multiplayer love multiplayer, so we want to do as much as we can to enable them to play with each other.

720
00:35:55,736 --> 00:36:02,942
So we did things like, when you go to the main menu of the game, if someone is waiting in the queue, in sort of a rank play, to play with someone, we tell them, hey, there's a game available.

721
00:36:02,942 --> 00:36:10,527
And you click on that, the screen on the left, it takes you to the screen on the right, and it says, oh, there's a match available for 1v1, or there's three players waiting for a four player.

722
00:36:10,527 --> 00:36:11,648
So you really want to help.

723
00:36:12,109 --> 00:36:14,951
bring people into the game, let them know that if they join

724
00:36:14,951 --> 00:36:16,091
they can start a game right now.

725
00:36:16,091 --> 00:36:19,554
Also, when you're in the queue waiting for a match,

726
00:36:19,554 --> 00:36:21,755
we actually let you play single player.

727
00:36:21,755 --> 00:36:24,337
So you can play a skirmish game,

728
00:36:24,337 --> 00:36:25,838
you can play the daily challenge,

729
00:36:25,838 --> 00:36:28,280
you can watch a replay file, you can do all this stuff

730
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:29,361
while it's waiting for an opponent,

731
00:36:29,361 --> 00:36:30,602
and as soon as you find that opponent,

732
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:33,404
you'll get moved into the multiplayer game.

733
00:36:33,404 --> 00:36:35,705
I think this has made a huge difference

734
00:36:35,705 --> 00:36:37,687
for keeping our multiplayer community alive,

735
00:36:37,687 --> 00:36:40,649
even with a pretty low multiplayer player base.

736
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:46,699
Yeah, so I want to talk now a little bit about early access.

737
00:36:46,699 --> 00:36:55,767
And to start out with, I want to kind of give you

738
00:36:55,767 --> 00:36:58,049
a sense of what our project looked

739
00:36:58,049 --> 00:36:59,910
like throughout development.

740
00:36:59,910 --> 00:37:03,834
So I started the game basically in the summer of 2013.

741
00:37:03,834 --> 00:37:06,816
So that lovely shot in the upper left

742
00:37:06,816 --> 00:37:09,178
is what the game looked like right off the beginning.

743
00:37:10,279 --> 00:37:13,301
and then in January we started introducing

744
00:37:13,301 --> 00:37:17,463
hex tiles and terrain basically,

745
00:37:17,463 --> 00:37:20,765
and then you can see things slowly improve step by step.

746
00:37:20,765 --> 00:37:23,186
The August 2014 is an important date,

747
00:37:23,186 --> 00:37:25,547
that's when we had what we called our founders program,

748
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:28,029
which was you could come to our website, buy the game.

749
00:37:28,827 --> 00:37:30,988
we actually didn't show people what the game looked like,

750
00:37:30,988 --> 00:37:32,709
so they were actually buying it blind,

751
00:37:32,709 --> 00:37:34,270
so I will be always grateful to people

752
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,490
who took part in that program.

753
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:38,952
But they bought into it, we sent them a Steam code,

754
00:37:38,952 --> 00:37:40,753
they downloaded the game,

755
00:37:40,753 --> 00:37:41,954
and then they were able to start playing it,

756
00:37:41,954 --> 00:37:42,834
and this is what it looked like.

757
00:37:42,834 --> 00:37:46,696
So it looked passable, right?

758
00:37:46,696 --> 00:37:49,178
You could imagine that it could eventually become a game.

759
00:37:49,178 --> 00:37:50,779
And this is the rest of the development.

760
00:37:50,779 --> 00:37:51,759
The one in the upper left there is,

761
00:37:51,759 --> 00:37:54,801
that's what it looked like when it launched in early access.

762
00:37:54,801 --> 00:37:56,502
And then from there on,

763
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:59,760
It's interesting because we went up in early access,

764
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:00,480
we heard a lot of people say,

765
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:02,722
oh wow, this looks like a finished game,

766
00:38:02,722 --> 00:38:04,784
but you can see clearly, just look at the cliffs,

767
00:38:04,784 --> 00:38:06,825
for example, like they're, you know, it just,

768
00:38:06,825 --> 00:38:10,488
there was so much more that we could improve in the game,

769
00:38:10,488 --> 00:38:14,271
but it was really important to me to release it early

770
00:38:14,271 --> 00:38:16,973
so that I could learn about the game from our players

771
00:38:16,973 --> 00:38:20,216
while we still had time to do something about it.

772
00:38:20,216 --> 00:38:20,356
So.

773
00:38:21,320 --> 00:38:24,742
What I think early access is important is the most common

774
00:38:24,742 --> 00:38:27,624
problem in the industry is waste. And that is people making

775
00:38:27,624 --> 00:38:32,167
decisions and having to wait months or even years before they

776
00:38:32,167 --> 00:38:35,609
know whether those decisions were good or not. And I learned

777
00:38:35,609 --> 00:38:40,252
this lesson while working on Civ 3 and Civ 4. Civ 3 was made

778
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:43,074
completely in a vacuum. The only people who ever played Civ 3

779
00:38:43,074 --> 00:38:46,036
before the game came out were either the people on the

780
00:38:46,036 --> 00:38:48,517
development team or the testers. That's it.

781
00:38:48,657 --> 00:38:52,802
and we shipped the game, it had a lot of issues. And the worst

782
00:38:52,802 --> 00:38:55,686
part is a lot of the issues were fairly obvious. There's the

783
00:38:55,686 --> 00:38:57,688
things that we should have caught and we could have easily

784
00:38:57,688 --> 00:39:00,712
done something about if we just knew about them at the time. So

785
00:39:00,712 --> 00:39:04,457
the CIV 4, I want to do it completely differently.

786
00:39:05,494 --> 00:39:08,677
After Civ 3 shipped, I really embedded myself into the Civ

787
00:39:08,677 --> 00:39:12,561
community, found some of the best voices in the community

788
00:39:12,561 --> 00:39:15,224
and helped them guide me to know how to basically patch Civ 3.

789
00:39:15,224 --> 00:39:18,307
So then the next step was, well, let's bring these people

790
00:39:18,307 --> 00:39:21,110
on board, create sort of this private testing group where

791
00:39:21,110 --> 00:39:22,471
they could play Civ 4 early.

792
00:39:22,471 --> 00:39:23,673
And I mean really early.

793
00:39:23,673 --> 00:39:25,354
They played it in the first half of the project.

794
00:39:27,036 --> 00:39:30,078
it was, Civ 4 was about a two and a half year development

795
00:39:30,078 --> 00:39:32,460
cycle and they played it at about the 12 month,

796
00:39:32,460 --> 00:39:33,501
you know, 12 months after development.

797
00:39:33,501 --> 00:39:35,302
So they played it when it was really early,

798
00:39:35,302 --> 00:39:38,225
it was really ugly, but I think that's the key reason

799
00:39:38,225 --> 00:39:42,007
why Civ 4 was really well received,

800
00:39:42,007 --> 00:39:44,930
is that we had this great iteration time

801
00:39:44,930 --> 00:39:46,911
with the fan community, you know,

802
00:39:46,911 --> 00:39:49,353
with actual players who are outside of the team

803
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:50,414
and didn't have all the prejudices

804
00:39:50,414 --> 00:39:51,475
you have inside of your team.

805
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:57,695
And we saw this immediately once we went up on early access,

806
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,737
that we were blind to certain problems in the game.

807
00:40:00,737 --> 00:40:02,779
And probably the most obvious example of this

808
00:40:02,779 --> 00:40:04,900
is the reveal map option.

809
00:40:04,900 --> 00:40:08,743
So the way we had made Offworld was it has a scanning mode

810
00:40:08,743 --> 00:40:09,583
when the game begins,

811
00:40:09,583 --> 00:40:11,204
which is basically the exploration part,

812
00:40:11,204 --> 00:40:12,826
and you just start clicking around the map,

813
00:40:12,826 --> 00:40:15,187
revealing tiles slowly,

814
00:40:15,187 --> 00:40:17,149
until you find what you think is a good founding location.

815
00:40:17,149 --> 00:40:19,070
And that works great in single player,

816
00:40:19,070 --> 00:40:20,611
but the multiplayer community

817
00:40:20,611 --> 00:40:22,012
just found it completely unacceptable.

818
00:40:22,252 --> 00:40:23,694
because basically you imagine two players,

819
00:40:23,694 --> 00:40:25,297
one of them scans one direction,

820
00:40:25,297 --> 00:40:26,639
one of them scans the other direction.

821
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:30,044
The person who went east finds a great founding location,

822
00:40:30,044 --> 00:40:31,446
puts down their headquarters.

823
00:40:31,446 --> 00:40:33,769
Person who went west feels like they lost the game

824
00:40:33,769 --> 00:40:37,214
because they just randomly went the wrong direction.

825
00:40:37,214 --> 00:40:39,315
we had game mechanics to basically balance that.

826
00:40:39,315 --> 00:40:40,595
Of like, well, whoever found second,

827
00:40:40,595 --> 00:40:42,715
you get extra claims and so on and so forth.

828
00:40:42,715 --> 00:40:44,816
But the main thing is perception.

829
00:40:44,816 --> 00:40:46,196
Like at that point, perception is reality.

830
00:40:46,196 --> 00:40:47,676
It felt unfair to people.

831
00:40:47,676 --> 00:40:48,677
So we tried something different.

832
00:40:48,677 --> 00:40:50,437
And this happened like within a month or two

833
00:40:50,437 --> 00:40:51,077
of early access.

834
00:40:51,077 --> 00:40:52,877
We like, we know we gotta do something about this.

835
00:40:52,877 --> 00:40:55,498
So I came up with the reveal map option,

836
00:40:55,498 --> 00:40:56,838
which means that basically the game,

837
00:40:56,838 --> 00:40:59,159
the map starts completely revealed

838
00:40:59,159 --> 00:41:01,379
and you have basically kind of like a reverse auction

839
00:41:01,379 --> 00:41:04,100
that you could found immediately if you want to,

840
00:41:04,100 --> 00:41:05,620
but you're gonna have to take on $200,000 of debt.

841
00:41:06,460 --> 00:41:07,921
And that price is just gonna get,

842
00:41:07,921 --> 00:41:09,702
kind of like slowly ticked down.

843
00:41:09,702 --> 00:41:11,903
I got this idea I think from Frozen Synapse,

844
00:41:11,903 --> 00:41:13,404
they have kind of like a similar idea of like,

845
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,244
you know, show the whole map and then you kind of bid

846
00:41:15,244 --> 00:41:17,225
on the different starting location.

847
00:41:17,225 --> 00:41:19,066
But like, you know, basically the number kind of

848
00:41:19,066 --> 00:41:21,627
keeps ticking down until it gets to the point

849
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:25,289
where you're like, well, I think the best spot on the map

850
00:41:25,289 --> 00:41:26,630
is worth say $40,000 of debt, so you're able to,

851
00:41:26,630 --> 00:41:27,650
you know, so you commit.

852
00:41:27,650 --> 00:41:29,211
You're the first mover, you get it.

853
00:41:29,211 --> 00:41:30,851
And then you find out if you made the right choice,

854
00:41:30,851 --> 00:41:32,112
you know, over the course of the game.

855
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,681
And that worked. The multiple computer were like, yes, that's

856
00:41:36,681 --> 00:41:40,541
it. That's the way they play the game, period. And if we had been

857
00:41:40,541 --> 00:41:44,422
a traditional game where we didn't go through early access,

858
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:49,023
we would have found this out two months after launch instead of

859
00:41:49,023 --> 00:41:51,444
12 months before launch. That makes a pretty big difference

860
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:55,265
because we then had 12 months to iterate on just this option

861
00:41:55,265 --> 00:41:58,946
itself. It became a core part of the game instead of a hacky fix

862
00:41:58,946 --> 00:42:00,086
that we had to do post launch.

863
00:42:02,648 --> 00:42:07,430
Another thing that was really important is that I knew we were going to make major changes in

864
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:12,873
early access and there have been games in early access that have made major changes that have

865
00:42:12,873 --> 00:42:16,855
really upset their community. And this is a hard thing. There's no simple answer here because

866
00:42:16,855 --> 00:42:20,197
the community thinks they have one game, they're happy with it, so the game changes.

867
00:42:20,477 --> 00:42:22,539
what, you know, like, and if they're unhappy with it,

868
00:42:22,539 --> 00:42:24,421
it can lead to, you know, it can lead to some really

869
00:42:24,421 --> 00:42:26,543
bad feelings, some bad reviews,

870
00:42:26,543 --> 00:42:28,004
lead to controversy, basically.

871
00:42:28,004 --> 00:42:29,846
We didn't want that to happen,

872
00:42:29,846 --> 00:42:31,928
so what we did is anytime we had some major change

873
00:42:31,928 --> 00:42:33,810
come through, and usually this meant something

874
00:42:33,810 --> 00:42:36,132
on the stock market, like the majority buyout feature,

875
00:42:36,132 --> 00:42:38,214
what we would do is we'd say,

876
00:42:38,214 --> 00:42:40,296
hey, we got this new feature, but it's an option.

877
00:42:40,756 --> 00:42:44,381
we would introduce as an option. When you set the game you can decide whether you're going to

878
00:42:44,381 --> 00:42:49,787
use it or not. But what we also did then is we do the update, hey, the new feature is here.

879
00:42:49,787 --> 00:42:53,773
Hey, and we're also going to host a community tournament. But if you play in the

880
00:42:53,773 --> 00:42:56,336
tournament, you have to play using this new feature.

881
00:42:56,797 --> 00:42:59,158
So which would encourage people to opt in because they want to

882
00:42:59,158 --> 00:43:02,199
play the official Mohawk tournament. They want to win.

883
00:43:02,199 --> 00:43:05,460
So it's not just the games inside of the tournament, but

884
00:43:05,460 --> 00:43:08,261
people would start practicing using this option, of course,

885
00:43:08,261 --> 00:43:11,402
because they wanted to get good at it. So immediately we get

886
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:15,004
all this great feedback on this feature. It's kind of like

887
00:43:15,004 --> 00:43:18,445
using, by incentivizing them to try it out, forcing it on them.

888
00:43:19,392 --> 00:43:22,813
I believe it's really important to get closer to your community.

889
00:43:22,813 --> 00:43:24,674
This is my friends list on steam.

890
00:43:24,674 --> 00:43:28,375
And you see these are some of the hardest core off-road

891
00:43:28,375 --> 00:43:28,695
players.

892
00:43:28,695 --> 00:43:30,715
You see people who have played games here for thousands of

893
00:43:30,715 --> 00:43:32,256
hours.

894
00:43:32,256 --> 00:43:35,376
And this is a sign that I'm really close with them.

895
00:43:35,376 --> 00:43:37,857
They see something wrong with the game, they'll message me

896
00:43:37,857 --> 00:43:38,357
immediately.

897
00:43:38,357 --> 00:43:40,358
And we'll talk back and forth about it.

898
00:43:41,278 --> 00:43:46,760
Twitch. I think Twitch is great. We stream on it weekly and we

899
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:50,502
use it for tournaments. And I think what's great about it is

900
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,523
it's just this public space where everyone can come

901
00:43:52,523 --> 00:43:55,364
together. You start streaming the game, so all your fans start

902
00:43:55,364 --> 00:43:58,165
to come there and it just kind of like snowballs from there

903
00:43:58,165 --> 00:44:00,406
because they meet each other and then they make connections and

904
00:44:00,406 --> 00:44:02,687
then they'll start streaming themselves. In fact, that's one

905
00:44:02,687 --> 00:44:05,068
thing we did early with our tournaments is we basically

906
00:44:05,068 --> 00:44:07,109
said if you're going to play in our tournament, you have to

907
00:44:07,109 --> 00:44:07,729
stream your game.

908
00:44:08,349 --> 00:44:09,910
which meant that a lot of our hardcore players

909
00:44:09,910 --> 00:44:12,012
then suddenly became Twitch streamers

910
00:44:12,012 --> 00:44:14,294
and then it kind of like, you know, multiplied from there.

911
00:44:14,294 --> 00:44:17,256
So that's something that worked great.

912
00:44:17,256 --> 00:44:17,696
Discords.

913
00:44:18,869 --> 00:44:20,830
I don't know how many of you guys are using Discord yet for

914
00:44:20,830 --> 00:44:22,912
games but I think Discord is going to become a really big

915
00:44:22,912 --> 00:44:27,335
deal. It's kind of completely replaced. Our forums are dead,

916
00:44:27,335 --> 00:44:30,997
our Reddit is dead, all of the action now is on Discord. And

917
00:44:30,997 --> 00:44:34,820
it's because it's real-time interaction. And so in fact,

918
00:44:34,820 --> 00:44:36,942
when you go into the game, we kind of point people to Discord

919
00:44:36,942 --> 00:44:39,584
right away, like, hey, join our Discord channel. It's a really

920
00:44:39,584 --> 00:44:42,165
friendly, healthy community. You'll often see people come on

921
00:44:42,165 --> 00:44:44,207
there and like, hey, I'm new to the game. And people say, oh,

922
00:44:44,207 --> 00:44:46,448
welcome, let me help you give you advice about how to play.

923
00:44:46,809 --> 00:44:49,711
I really, I really, and also it's a place where,

924
00:44:49,711 --> 00:44:52,814
you can see here, the channel I'm in is actually

925
00:44:52,814 --> 00:44:54,976
like a feedback, a private feedback channel I have

926
00:44:54,976 --> 00:44:57,299
for some of the more core players.

927
00:44:57,299 --> 00:45:00,001
So like it's a way to also kind of like

928
00:45:00,001 --> 00:45:01,382
bring them all together in one place

929
00:45:01,382 --> 00:45:03,204
to talk about stuff that's coming further down the road

930
00:45:03,204 --> 00:45:04,746
without having to expose everyone to that.

931
00:45:05,654 --> 00:45:10,078
and here's one of the nice benefits about being so close to your players. We have a daily

932
00:45:10,078 --> 00:45:16,903
challenge in the game. You play a single player game on the same random seed that changes every

933
00:45:16,903 --> 00:45:20,346
24 hours and we have a replay feature where when you finish the game, you can see the

934
00:45:20,847 --> 00:45:23,628
the replay gets uploaded and then you can,

935
00:45:23,628 --> 00:45:25,649
all the other players can download and see how everyone else,

936
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,870
how did someone get that great time in the daily challenge?

937
00:45:27,870 --> 00:45:30,150
So what I would do is I would come into the morning,

938
00:45:30,150 --> 00:45:31,211
I'd open up the daily challenge,

939
00:45:31,211 --> 00:45:33,892
see who got the best score, watch the replay,

940
00:45:33,892 --> 00:45:35,913
and I'd be immediately like, oh, they're using this,

941
00:45:35,913 --> 00:45:37,694
they're using this strategy against the AI,

942
00:45:37,694 --> 00:45:38,594
or they're doing this thing,

943
00:45:38,594 --> 00:45:39,514
or like they're using this thing,

944
00:45:39,514 --> 00:45:41,415
and I think that's totally imbalanced.

945
00:45:41,415 --> 00:45:44,997
So what I would do is like, I would then see what they did,

946
00:45:44,997 --> 00:45:45,937
I would change the AI,

947
00:45:46,857 --> 00:45:48,558
I would make a build, I'd push it to steam,

948
00:45:48,558 --> 00:45:49,839
and then I'd contact that person,

949
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,400
and be like, hey, try what you did this morning again.

950
00:45:53,400 --> 00:45:56,021
And then I'd find out whether I fixed the problem or not.

951
00:45:56,021 --> 00:45:57,182
I mean, this is amazing, right?

952
00:45:57,182 --> 00:46:00,243
This is like 24 hour iteration directly with the community.

953
00:46:02,155 --> 00:46:05,257
I never dreamed of that, like working on Civ 4.

954
00:46:05,257 --> 00:46:08,499
Even though I had players, you had this weeks of lag

955
00:46:08,499 --> 00:46:10,360
between when you do something and when you find out

956
00:46:10,360 --> 00:46:11,861
whether your decisions were good.

957
00:46:11,861 --> 00:46:13,802
This is, it's amazing to be able to do this.

958
00:46:13,802 --> 00:46:16,424
And you know, community extends your game, right?

959
00:46:16,424 --> 00:46:18,285
Like we had so many people playing the game,

960
00:46:18,285 --> 00:46:22,008
putting up videos that like within our release week,

961
00:46:22,008 --> 00:46:23,649
we had a million and a half views.

962
00:46:25,010 --> 00:46:27,751
Some of the super fans have eventually helped out with the

963
00:46:27,751 --> 00:46:31,653
team, whether that means streaming or testing or Blue's

964
00:46:31,653 --> 00:46:33,474
designed our last DLC that just came out.

965
00:46:33,474 --> 00:46:36,736
You'll see people on Discord basically say,

966
00:46:36,736 --> 00:46:38,437
like, hey, post your, you know,

967
00:46:38,437 --> 00:46:39,558
for new players who are having a hard time,

968
00:46:39,558 --> 00:46:40,878
post your replay, I'll take a look at it,

969
00:46:40,878 --> 00:46:43,019
I'll give you advice.

970
00:46:43,019 --> 00:46:44,961
It's just, you know, community is important.

971
00:46:44,961 --> 00:46:46,701
I mean, people understand that.

972
00:46:46,701 --> 00:46:47,982
All right, so.

973
00:46:48,311 --> 00:46:50,714
probably some things we do differently about early access

974
00:46:50,714 --> 00:46:55,118
if we did it again. One is we had basically a full QA pass.

975
00:46:55,118 --> 00:46:59,343
We would do kind of a big monthly updates. Which meant we

976
00:46:59,343 --> 00:47:01,645
kind of did a full QA pass because we wanted them to be

977
00:47:01,645 --> 00:47:02,866
polished. And

978
00:47:03,627 --> 00:47:07,851
that's fine but it's kind of grueling on the team to put them through that process. You're

979
00:47:07,851 --> 00:47:13,756
releasing every month, we're a small team, we want to be moving quickly. So we did a couple

980
00:47:13,756 --> 00:47:17,760
things to help ourselves out. We had a next version branch which is basically one we could

981
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:21,443
update whenever we wanted to without going through QA because you had to opt into it. So

982
00:47:21,443 --> 00:47:26,147
that helped. But I think that next time around probably what I would do is I would just have a

983
00:47:26,147 --> 00:47:28,849
build machine that automatically updates the public version every Monday.

984
00:47:29,661 --> 00:47:33,304
and if there's a problem, just do a roll back or a hot fix.

985
00:47:33,304 --> 00:47:36,688
Like, it's okay, I've found, you know,

986
00:47:36,688 --> 00:47:39,190
if you're in touch with the community, like, it's okay.

987
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:42,013
Like, I think that they're generally forgiving of problems

988
00:47:42,013 --> 00:47:42,833
if you're responsive.

989
00:47:43,354 --> 00:47:47,677
I would probably also wait a little bit longer to go up in

990
00:47:47,677 --> 00:47:53,742
early access. Be aware that your only free press hit comes when

991
00:47:53,742 --> 00:47:56,084
you launch on early access. That's kind of like when the

992
00:47:56,084 --> 00:48:00,087
press conceive of you as a new game. A lot of the big

993
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:03,169
YouTubers and streamers were only interested in the game the

994
00:48:03,169 --> 00:48:05,531
first time around. When we had the final launch they kind of

995
00:48:05,531 --> 00:48:09,174
had moved on basically. In some cases you have the worst cases.

996
00:48:09,174 --> 00:48:11,616
We had one very prominent YouTuber viewer.

997
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:13,739
people ask when it came out in early access,

998
00:48:13,739 --> 00:48:15,522
hey, are you going to review this?

999
00:48:15,522 --> 00:48:18,207
And he said, oh, I don't do reviews of early access games.

1000
00:48:18,207 --> 00:48:21,392
But then when we came out for real,

1001
00:48:21,392 --> 00:48:23,176
he basically had forgotten about it.

1002
00:48:23,176 --> 00:48:24,498
So, you know, that can happen.

1003
00:48:26,778 --> 00:48:28,860
This is how I like to do early access.

1004
00:48:28,860 --> 00:48:32,723
Which is, the more steps you have from testing a game

1005
00:48:32,723 --> 00:48:34,665
internally to releasing it, the better.

1006
00:48:34,665 --> 00:48:38,789
You want a whole bunch of smaller incremental steps

1007
00:48:38,789 --> 00:48:40,390
to get to the final release.

1008
00:48:40,390 --> 00:48:43,734
What we did was this.

1009
00:48:44,394 --> 00:48:46,997
We had a private beta, and then we jumped all the way

1010
00:48:46,997 --> 00:48:47,978
to early access.

1011
00:48:47,978 --> 00:48:50,981
And I would really like to have two steps in between there,

1012
00:48:50,981 --> 00:48:51,862
at least.

1013
00:48:51,862 --> 00:48:53,744
A public beta, where we're like, OK, now we're

1014
00:48:53,744 --> 00:48:55,646
going to show our game publicly and let you buy it

1015
00:48:55,646 --> 00:48:58,309
through our site, the way a game like Factorio work,

1016
00:48:58,309 --> 00:48:58,689
for example.

1017
00:48:59,450 --> 00:49:02,151
And then the next step would be like an unlisted Steam page,

1018
00:49:02,151 --> 00:49:04,492
which is the idea that your game's up on Steam,

1019
00:49:04,492 --> 00:49:06,133
people can buy it, but only if they have

1020
00:49:06,133 --> 00:49:07,274
like an external link to it.

1021
00:49:07,274 --> 00:49:09,675
Kind of like one of those like private YouTube videos

1022
00:49:09,675 --> 00:49:11,656
you can only watch if you happen to have the link.

1023
00:49:11,656 --> 00:49:14,497
And your game wouldn't show up on Steam in like searches

1024
00:49:14,497 --> 00:49:17,319
or in the top sellers or it wouldn't be promoted,

1025
00:49:17,319 --> 00:49:18,159
that type of thing.

1026
00:49:18,279 --> 00:49:20,442
So that's a great way to kind of like have that stream

1027
00:49:20,442 --> 00:49:21,042
infrastructure.

1028
00:49:21,042 --> 00:49:23,104
There's a lot of players who don't want to buy a game

1029
00:49:23,104 --> 00:49:25,727
until it's on Steam, period, end of story.

1030
00:49:25,727 --> 00:49:28,430
So if you have this, you're able to pull in those players,

1031
00:49:28,430 --> 00:49:30,853
even if you're not kind of like getting the full on hit

1032
00:49:30,853 --> 00:49:32,034
of being up on early,

1033
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:34,096
the full on pressure of being up on early access.

1034
00:49:35,931 --> 00:49:37,712
So this is kind of an interesting question.

1035
00:49:37,712 --> 00:49:39,754
We were $40 in early access, which was like,

1036
00:49:39,754 --> 00:49:43,516
made us one of the absolutely most expensive games on there.

1037
00:49:43,516 --> 00:49:45,197
And I think you can, if you want to,

1038
00:49:45,197 --> 00:49:46,518
charge less when you're in early access

1039
00:49:46,518 --> 00:49:48,439
and then raise the price, which is unusual.

1040
00:49:48,439 --> 00:49:49,980
You don't normally get a chance to do that,

1041
00:49:49,980 --> 00:49:53,022
but I think you can pull it off there.

1042
00:49:53,022 --> 00:49:55,904
But I'm not sure if we should have lowered the price

1043
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:58,746
because although it did, having a high price

1044
00:49:58,746 --> 00:50:01,328
definitely hurt our review score on Steam,

1045
00:50:01,328 --> 00:50:02,188
but it definitely kept.

1046
00:50:03,357 --> 00:50:05,097
We didn't have too many players to deal with.

1047
00:50:05,097 --> 00:50:07,238
The players that we got during the early access

1048
00:50:07,238 --> 00:50:09,359
were really what I call high quality players.

1049
00:50:09,359 --> 00:50:10,919
They were ones who wanted to be part

1050
00:50:10,919 --> 00:50:12,620
of the development process,

1051
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:15,061
and they were good to work with.

1052
00:50:15,061 --> 00:50:17,162
So I'm kind of unsure about this.

1053
00:50:18,142 --> 00:50:20,624
But this is kind of like my big general feeling about early

1054
00:50:20,624 --> 00:50:22,486
access and about games in general.

1055
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:25,528
Eventually your players always understand your game better

1056
00:50:25,528 --> 00:50:26,469
than you do.

1057
00:50:26,469 --> 00:50:29,672
And being able to do early access means you're like fully

1058
00:50:29,672 --> 00:50:31,033
committing to that truth.

1059
00:50:31,033 --> 00:50:33,895
Like that's just the way it is whether you like it or not.

1060
00:50:33,895 --> 00:50:38,399
I also have some suggestions for what Valve should do.

1061
00:50:38,399 --> 00:50:41,201
As I mentioned, the unlisted store pages, as I understand,

1062
00:50:41,201 --> 00:50:43,283
I think this might actually be happening now.

1063
00:50:45,612 --> 00:50:48,234
I also think there should be an early access category for reviews.

1064
00:50:48,234 --> 00:50:53,097
Qualities of games can go up and down over time and it makes a lot of sense that a game

1065
00:50:53,097 --> 00:50:56,299
when it was early access is going to be better after release than before release.

1066
00:50:56,299 --> 00:51:00,402
So I don't see why you wouldn't want to just have a separate category for those type of

1067
00:51:00,402 --> 00:51:01,823
reviews.

1068
00:51:01,823 --> 00:51:05,625
And I also think there shouldn't be sales or refunds during early access.

1069
00:51:05,625 --> 00:51:10,008
This is a quote from a Subnautica developer and he points out that, you know...

1070
00:51:10,853 --> 00:51:13,655
When you lower the price, you get a group of people

1071
00:51:13,655 --> 00:51:16,417
who are less dedicated to your product,

1072
00:51:16,417 --> 00:51:18,098
and there's a pretty good chance

1073
00:51:18,098 --> 00:51:19,619
you're gonna leave a negative view,

1074
00:51:19,619 --> 00:51:21,380
because they didn't really research it.

1075
00:51:21,380 --> 00:51:23,401
They didn't really know what they were getting into.

1076
00:51:23,401 --> 00:51:26,543
And I'd say that the goal here

1077
00:51:26,543 --> 00:51:29,485
is actually to get fewer players.

1078
00:51:29,725 --> 00:51:32,108
You know, you want there to be kind of a bigger hurdle

1079
00:51:32,108 --> 00:51:35,072
for people to buy your game, Windows on Early Access,

1080
00:51:35,072 --> 00:51:37,255
so they know they're doing something different.

1081
00:51:37,255 --> 00:51:38,818
They're not just buying a game on Steam,

1082
00:51:38,818 --> 00:51:41,541
they're buying a game that's in development.

1083
00:51:41,541 --> 00:51:44,726
Like, so I would be totally happy with, you know.

1084
00:51:44,806 --> 00:51:48,428
kind of like a smaller group of players in early access that are more committed to the

1085
00:51:48,428 --> 00:51:53,650
development process. Also, be good to your early access customers. When we released, we

1086
00:51:53,650 --> 00:51:59,853
automatically upgraded them all to the deluxe edition. They started off immediately with

1087
00:51:59,853 --> 00:52:07,937
soundtrack and the DLC that we launched. These are your best fans. Treat them well. So speaking

1088
00:52:07,937 --> 00:52:09,998
of reviews, I want to mention a few things about them.

1089
00:52:12,446 --> 00:52:17,388
So here's a guy who left a negative review a long time ago.

1090
00:52:17,388 --> 00:52:20,829
We had a big UI change, he really, really didn't like it.

1091
00:52:20,829 --> 00:52:23,631
And our executive producer at Stardock,

1092
00:52:23,631 --> 00:52:25,431
very politely mentioned like,

1093
00:52:25,431 --> 00:52:27,572
hey, maybe you wanna, we've released the game,

1094
00:52:27,572 --> 00:52:29,173
made some changes, you might wanna check it out.

1095
00:52:29,173 --> 00:52:30,614
And so I think he, I can't, sorry for me to read,

1096
00:52:30,614 --> 00:52:32,474
but I think he came back like eight or nine months later

1097
00:52:32,474 --> 00:52:34,095
and was like, oh, this is great, you fixed everything,

1098
00:52:34,095 --> 00:52:36,516
I love the game, and changed his review.

1099
00:52:36,516 --> 00:52:38,397
So if you take the right attitude toward it,

1100
00:52:38,397 --> 00:52:38,877
I think that could be.

1101
00:52:39,457 --> 00:52:41,138
there's no harm there.

1102
00:52:41,138 --> 00:52:43,100
I mean, sometimes you find someone and clearly

1103
00:52:43,100 --> 00:52:44,561
they're just looking for a different type of game.

1104
00:52:44,561 --> 00:52:45,661
That happens to us sometimes.

1105
00:52:45,661 --> 00:52:47,222
It feels like sometimes people come to Offworld

1106
00:52:47,222 --> 00:52:48,923
thinking it's gonna be like Anno

1107
00:52:48,923 --> 00:52:51,245
and we're never gonna be able to make the game

1108
00:52:51,245 --> 00:52:51,925
what they want.

1109
00:52:51,925 --> 00:52:53,206
And so that's just, you know,

1110
00:52:53,206 --> 00:52:54,967
unfortunately maybe we need to just do our job

1111
00:52:54,967 --> 00:52:56,888
of how we're marketing the game in that case.

1112
00:52:58,270 --> 00:53:00,171
So here's a negative review of someone who found the game a

1113
00:53:00,171 --> 00:53:04,975
little bit like a chewing exercise. So he's not a big fan.

1114
00:53:04,975 --> 00:53:06,997
Here's one of the interesting things about achievements I

1115
00:53:06,997 --> 00:53:10,880
didn't expect. They're a great way to give context to negative

1116
00:53:10,880 --> 00:53:14,743
reviews. So I saw him and I'm like, I feel like Offworld is an

1117
00:53:14,743 --> 00:53:17,266
exciting, dynamic, challenging game. He doesn't. I wonder why.

1118
00:53:17,926 --> 00:53:23,988
I clicked on his profile and I found out, oh, he only played on the second lowest

1119
00:53:23,988 --> 00:53:27,850
difficulty level. And there's nine difficulty levels in off world. So the second level is

1120
00:53:27,850 --> 00:53:33,872
like, it's super easy. And so I don't necessarily know what I should do about this problem.

1121
00:53:33,872 --> 00:53:38,333
Like should we take away the easy levels? Should we push people to the higher levels more? I'm

1122
00:53:38,333 --> 00:53:42,975
not sure. But at least I have some context about the complaint. So here's another big

1123
00:53:42,975 --> 00:53:46,676
question. People often worry about going to early access. Do you get a second launch?

1124
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:52,197
right? And I was very worried about this. I asked all sorts of

1125
00:53:52,197 --> 00:53:54,679
people who were up on early access what would happen when we

1126
00:53:54,679 --> 00:53:58,841
came out. And for us at least, we did. We actually sold almost

1127
00:53:58,841 --> 00:54:01,483
the exact same number of units our first two weeks of early

1128
00:54:01,483 --> 00:54:06,886
access as we did our first two weeks of release. And month by

1129
00:54:06,886 --> 00:54:09,688
month we've done better after early access than we did while

1130
00:54:09,688 --> 00:54:10,368
we were on early access.

1131
00:54:11,229 --> 00:54:13,750
That's what you see. Those are our lifetime sales. Those DLC

1132
00:54:13,750 --> 00:54:16,631
numbers are inflated a little bit because we gave a bunch of

1133
00:54:16,631 --> 00:54:19,873
DLC away to our early access owners. So it's hard to judge

1134
00:54:19,873 --> 00:54:23,494
what that would be without that. So maybe half those numbers

1135
00:54:23,494 --> 00:54:28,057
it's hard to evaluate. But at any rate, our DLC is doing well

1136
00:54:28,057 --> 00:54:32,419
and we've been able to introduce basically one every month or

1137
00:54:32,419 --> 00:54:36,721
two. And there's pretty good pick up on it. This is our

1138
00:54:36,721 --> 00:54:39,362
sales graph from the very beginning of early access to a

1139
00:54:39,362 --> 00:54:39,882
week ago.

1140
00:54:40,525 --> 00:54:45,609
I want to highlight a few points on it. This is early access

1141
00:54:45,609 --> 00:54:49,252
release. This is final release. You can see the curves look

1142
00:54:49,252 --> 00:54:52,775
almost identical which is really encouraging. That's nice to know.

1143
00:54:53,992 --> 00:54:55,712
These were our first major discounts.

1144
00:54:55,712 --> 00:54:57,353
This is the first time we were 50% off,

1145
00:54:57,353 --> 00:54:59,774
was actually during the early access phase,

1146
00:54:59,774 --> 00:55:01,295
and the first time we went down to 66% off

1147
00:55:01,295 --> 00:55:03,976
was actually pretty recently, a few months ago.

1148
00:55:03,976 --> 00:55:07,738
And those first discounts are a big deal.

1149
00:55:07,738 --> 00:55:09,098
You're gonna need a major spike there.

1150
00:55:09,098 --> 00:55:11,699
I think we actually probably should have waited

1151
00:55:11,699 --> 00:55:14,761
to go 50% off after release.

1152
00:55:14,761 --> 00:55:16,621
And so I would definitely do that differently

1153
00:55:16,621 --> 00:55:17,102
next time around.

1154
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:21,624
These are capsule events, weekend deals,

1155
00:55:21,624 --> 00:55:24,245
or when we went up on Steam Workshop.

1156
00:55:24,245 --> 00:55:26,506
And those are a big deal.

1157
00:55:26,506 --> 00:55:29,988
I mean, that's the main thing on Steam is visibility.

1158
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:31,509
You know, being on the front page,

1159
00:55:31,509 --> 00:55:32,830
that's where the sales come from.

1160
00:55:32,830 --> 00:55:35,471
These are the event sales.

1161
00:55:35,471 --> 00:55:39,093
The summer sale, Starduck has a sale basically every,

1162
00:55:39,093 --> 00:55:40,614
excuse me, autumn.

1163
00:55:40,614 --> 00:55:42,315
And then the Christmas sale.

1164
00:55:43,968 --> 00:55:46,090
And I found this graph really interesting.

1165
00:55:46,090 --> 00:55:48,812
This is our total revenue by price.

1166
00:55:48,812 --> 00:55:52,896
And so you can see that like 40% of our revenue

1167
00:55:52,896 --> 00:55:55,058
is basically at full price.

1168
00:55:55,058 --> 00:55:57,420
And actually it's definitely higher than that.

1169
00:55:57,420 --> 00:55:59,722
I suspect it's almost 50% because these numbers

1170
00:55:59,722 --> 00:56:02,065
don't include early access for whatever reason

1171
00:56:02,065 --> 00:56:03,046
the numbers I had were all.

1172
00:56:03,546 --> 00:56:06,747
post final release.

1173
00:56:06,747 --> 00:56:09,168
And on early access, we never went down below 50%.

1174
00:56:09,168 --> 00:56:11,088
But at any rate, there's a sense that

1175
00:56:11,088 --> 00:56:15,350
once after you release, you're gonna make

1176
00:56:15,350 --> 00:56:17,670
all of your revenue just off your sales.

1177
00:56:17,670 --> 00:56:19,611
And I think this shows that you're still making

1178
00:56:19,611 --> 00:56:21,952
pretty good revenue even just day after day

1179
00:56:21,952 --> 00:56:23,232
just selling at a normal price.

1180
00:56:25,396 --> 00:56:27,517
All right. So I do want to get to the end here. I think it's

1181
00:56:27,517 --> 00:56:30,199
important to always ask yourself, you know, beyond all

1182
00:56:30,199 --> 00:56:33,021
of this stuff about what the development was like and all

1183
00:56:33,021 --> 00:56:36,303
different random game mechanics, why do you make games at all?

1184
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:40,425
You know, and so I often get asked whether off world is a

1185
00:56:40,425 --> 00:56:43,667
free trade game or an anti-capitalist game or some

1186
00:56:43,667 --> 00:56:44,908
other statement on the world economy.

1187
00:56:45,649 --> 00:56:47,990
And I don't think games should be trying to make broad

1188
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:51,032
statements like, you know, capitalism is good or capitalism

1189
00:56:51,032 --> 00:56:54,855
is bad. It's just too simplistic. And also the game

1190
00:56:54,855 --> 00:56:57,937
designer has too much power to set up the rules to support his

1191
00:56:57,937 --> 00:56:58,978
or her own biases.

1192
00:57:02,091 --> 00:57:03,952
This is what I think off world is about.

1193
00:57:03,952 --> 00:57:04,912
The prices tell a story.

1194
00:57:04,912 --> 00:57:07,633
You know, in off world, if iron costs more than steel,

1195
00:57:07,633 --> 00:57:09,674
then something has gone wrong.

1196
00:57:09,674 --> 00:57:11,955
And you win by taking advantage of these discrepancies.

1197
00:57:11,955 --> 00:57:15,136
You know, that puts you in the shoes of a business person,

1198
00:57:15,136 --> 00:57:17,557
which is really sort of the best that a game can do.

1199
00:57:17,557 --> 00:57:19,358
You know, there's a reason why everything costs

1200
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:19,818
what it does.

1201
00:57:19,818 --> 00:57:22,559
You know, sometimes that goes beyond supply and demand,

1202
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,600
to government policy, and cultural factors.

1203
00:57:25,600 --> 00:57:26,781
But there's always a reason.

1204
00:57:26,781 --> 00:57:28,742
And if we don't like what something costs,

1205
00:57:28,742 --> 00:57:31,423
we should find out why instead of just complaining about it.

1206
00:57:33,543 --> 00:57:36,885
But more broadly, I made off with a trading company for the

1207
00:57:36,885 --> 00:57:39,487
same reason I make all strategy games, that they are

1208
00:57:39,487 --> 00:57:43,068
anti-ideological. In a good strategy game, the answer to

1209
00:57:43,068 --> 00:57:46,330
every question, what HQ is best, what resource is most

1210
00:57:46,330 --> 00:57:49,692
important, what should I research first, should always

1211
00:57:49,692 --> 00:57:51,233
start with, well, it depends.

1212
00:57:51,773 --> 00:57:54,276
The point of having to make tough choices

1213
00:57:54,276 --> 00:57:55,698
and to adapt to the environment is that

1214
00:57:55,698 --> 00:58:00,464
there is never ever just one right answer to follow blindly.

1215
00:58:00,464 --> 00:58:02,547
And I think that lesson is as important now

1216
00:58:02,547 --> 00:58:03,468
as it has ever been.

1217
00:58:03,468 --> 00:58:07,092
And that's it, thanks for coming.

1218
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:21,400
time for maybe one or two. All right. Go ahead. What impact has

1219
00:58:21,400 --> 00:58:23,564
the DLCs had on your community? Did it fragment them or bring

1220
00:58:23,564 --> 00:58:25,247
them together? Um...

1221
00:58:26,106 --> 00:58:28,666
So we did a few things to basically make sure

1222
00:58:28,666 --> 00:58:29,967
that it wouldn't happen.

1223
00:58:29,967 --> 00:58:32,547
So like for example, we had a series,

1224
00:58:32,547 --> 00:58:34,768
DLC series as an asteroid,

1225
00:58:34,768 --> 00:58:36,328
as large as asteroid, the asteroid belt,

1226
00:58:36,328 --> 00:58:38,328
an alternate location to play at.

1227
00:58:38,328 --> 00:58:39,448
And then we were worried about like,

1228
00:58:39,448 --> 00:58:42,209
well, what would happen if someone has it,

1229
00:58:42,209 --> 00:58:43,469
one person has it, another person doesn't,

1230
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:44,469
they wanna play a multiplayer.

1231
00:58:44,469 --> 00:58:45,590
And we just solved it by saying like,

1232
00:58:45,590 --> 00:58:47,230
if you have the DLC and you host the game,

1233
00:58:47,230 --> 00:58:48,390
anyone can join you.

1234
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:50,511
Or in ranked play, it just comes up automatically,

1235
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:51,831
even if you don't have the DLC.

1236
00:58:52,491 --> 00:58:54,172
like you'll still be exposed to it.

1237
00:58:54,172 --> 00:58:55,673
You just won't be able to play in a single player.

1238
00:58:55,673 --> 00:58:57,954
So, you know, you just do the best you can, basically.

1239
00:58:57,954 --> 00:58:58,814
Thanks.

1240
00:58:58,814 --> 00:59:00,255
Mm-hmm.

1241
00:59:00,255 --> 00:59:01,996
Hey, the game is so brilliant,

1242
00:59:01,996 --> 00:59:03,877
but it's so different from anything else on the market.

1243
00:59:03,877 --> 00:59:06,378
I'm curious, how did you approach

1244
00:59:06,378 --> 00:59:08,379
teaching players how to play the game,

1245
00:59:08,379 --> 00:59:11,841
since there's so little to look at from other games,

1246
00:59:11,841 --> 00:59:13,301
so little experience to pull in?

1247
00:59:14,099 --> 00:59:16,901
Yeah, so, and this is something I'm particularly bad at,

1248
00:59:16,901 --> 00:59:18,042
actually, is tutorials.

1249
00:59:18,042 --> 00:59:19,703
I just, I'm really bad at that,

1250
00:59:19,703 --> 00:59:23,926
but fortunately, my business partner and art director,

1251
00:59:23,926 --> 00:59:27,509
Dorian is, Newcomb, is very good at that.

1252
00:59:27,509 --> 00:59:31,413
He worked hard on the CIFI tutorials, which are amazing,

1253
00:59:31,413 --> 00:59:33,354
and he just, you know, like,

1254
00:59:33,354 --> 00:59:34,955
fully committed to that part of the project.

1255
00:59:34,955 --> 00:59:37,758
So, I'm afraid I don't really have a good answer for it,

1256
00:59:37,758 --> 00:59:39,719
because he's the one that does it,

1257
00:59:39,719 --> 00:59:41,280
and I'm just glad I'm working with him.

1258
00:59:45,395 --> 00:59:48,917
Hey, so when you put the game up for sale initially,

1259
00:59:48,917 --> 00:59:51,038
the one where you had no screenshots,

1260
00:59:51,038 --> 00:59:54,360
you also put up the rule set or like a design document

1261
00:59:54,360 --> 00:59:57,041
that read very much like a board game rule set.

1262
00:59:57,041 --> 00:59:58,762
Can you talk a little bit about that,

1263
00:59:58,762 --> 00:59:59,622
why you chose to do that?

1264
01:00:01,169 --> 01:00:06,270
Yeah, so we weren't showing a screen shot, but I felt like the most important thing was the

1265
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:11,571
rules themselves. We were able to take advantage of the fact that the game had such a board

1266
01:00:11,571 --> 01:00:18,792
game feel. I don't know how many board games I have that I read the rules but never actually

1267
01:00:18,792 --> 01:00:22,373
played. So that is a phenomenon. People kind of understand what that's like. So I thought

1268
01:00:22,373 --> 01:00:27,354
that they're probably the players that we wanted to get were people who would be good with

1269
01:00:27,354 --> 01:00:27,534
that.

1270
01:00:29,134 --> 01:00:30,616
they'd be like, oh cool, there's a little bit

1271
01:00:30,616 --> 01:00:32,017
of a small rule book for me to read,

1272
01:00:32,017 --> 01:00:33,479
and that'll give me a sense of how the game plays,

1273
01:00:33,479 --> 01:00:34,460
and I'll kind of like imagine it,

1274
01:00:34,460 --> 01:00:36,162
and maybe I'll be off a little bit,

1275
01:00:36,162 --> 01:00:38,144
but that'll like make me kind of want to get into the game.

1276
01:00:38,144 --> 01:00:39,265
I mean, I wanted to give them something, right?

1277
01:00:39,265 --> 01:00:40,426
We're not giving them a screenshot.

1278
01:00:40,426 --> 01:00:41,247
We gotta give them something.

1279
01:00:41,247 --> 01:00:42,168
Go ahead, thanks.

1280
01:00:42,877 --> 01:00:44,979
So I want to address one thing, the question about tutorials,

1281
01:00:44,979 --> 01:00:46,901
one other thing we really focused on is in the UI,

1282
01:00:46,901 --> 01:00:49,483
we really focused on trying to give all the information

1283
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,305
you needed when something happened.

1284
01:00:51,305 --> 01:00:54,328
You want to build a metal mine, you press the metal mine,

1285
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:55,909
we immediately show a line to the iron,

1286
01:00:55,909 --> 01:00:57,531
we show a line to the aluminum.

1287
01:00:57,531 --> 01:01:00,153
Like, there's another half of it, which is,

1288
01:01:00,153 --> 01:01:01,655
we try to make sure we always give people

1289
01:01:01,655 --> 01:01:03,757
the information they need just when they need it in the game.

1290
01:01:03,757 --> 01:01:05,919
And so that's super important too, beyond tutorials.

1291
01:01:07,914 --> 01:01:11,778
you know, kind of more on the tutorial side. Did you feel like, you know,

1292
01:01:11,778 --> 01:01:14,941
because the tutorials felt like they told a story and they had the mission

1293
01:01:14,941 --> 01:01:19,185
segments to them. Do you feel like you got any pushback or lost any revenue

1294
01:01:19,185 --> 01:01:23,068
opportunities by not having an actual official campaign?

1295
01:01:24,612 --> 01:01:27,953
So the campaign is that we have an off world is dynamic and it

1296
01:01:27,953 --> 01:01:30,695
has what you call like a light story touch. There's

1297
01:01:30,695 --> 01:01:33,856
characters. There's not really much of a story. Part of that

1298
01:01:33,856 --> 01:01:36,497
is like if I had to write a story, it would be absolutely

1299
01:01:36,497 --> 01:01:42,400
terrible. This is just not what I do. And I kind of wanted the

1300
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:44,541
freedom to develop a dynamic campaign that you could do that

1301
01:01:44,541 --> 01:01:45,122
was replayable.

1302
01:01:45,682 --> 01:01:49,907
doesn't match a lot of players expectations for RTS. But I was

1303
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:53,631
already not matching anyone's expectations for RTS anyway. So

1304
01:01:53,631 --> 01:01:56,074
I figured I might as well go for it. I think it's just kind of

1305
01:01:56,074 --> 01:02:00,419
like we're a small team. We don't, seven or eight guys and we

1306
01:02:00,419 --> 01:02:02,321
have various things that we're good at. That was just something

1307
01:02:02,321 --> 01:02:03,923
that we absolutely were not good at.

1308
01:02:04,683 --> 01:02:07,104
I bet there's a lot of players who would get into the game

1309
01:02:07,104 --> 01:02:09,745
if we had a more standard story-based campaign.

1310
01:02:09,745 --> 01:02:10,505
It's just something.

1311
01:02:10,505 --> 01:02:11,465
And actually, I think it's something

1312
01:02:11,465 --> 01:02:12,425
that we're gonna get into.

1313
01:02:12,425 --> 01:02:14,265
There is a writer that we're working with now,

1314
01:02:14,265 --> 01:02:15,226
writer slash designer,

1315
01:02:15,226 --> 01:02:16,786
who I've worked with in various projects,

1316
01:02:16,786 --> 01:02:19,087
who designed the Patron and Patriot DLC,

1317
01:02:19,087 --> 01:02:21,907
which is a huge expansion of the campaign

1318
01:02:21,907 --> 01:02:24,988
and did have a lot of story content for the new CEOs.

1319
01:02:24,988 --> 01:02:26,748
And so we're probably gonna continue working with him.

1320
01:02:26,748 --> 01:02:29,089
He's gonna backfill a lot of that story into the game.

1321
01:02:29,089 --> 01:02:29,129
So.

1322
01:02:29,129 --> 01:02:29,829
It's great to hear.

1323
01:02:29,829 --> 01:02:30,469
Thank you so much.

1324
01:02:30,469 --> 01:02:31,009
Yeah, cool, thanks.

1325
01:02:33,561 --> 01:02:36,931
Do you have any plans to port the game to console, like PS4?

1326
01:02:36,931 --> 01:02:37,272
Uhhh...

1327
01:02:40,039 --> 01:02:41,400
No, not right now.

1328
01:02:41,400 --> 01:02:42,861
But it's always possible.

1329
01:02:42,861 --> 01:02:46,043
I mean, so I did actually did a mapping

1330
01:02:46,043 --> 01:02:48,985
to the console controller.

1331
01:02:48,985 --> 01:02:51,466
And, you know, it's okay, right?

1332
01:02:51,466 --> 01:02:52,247
But it's like it's an RTS.

1333
01:02:52,247 --> 01:02:55,089
It's really hard to pull off with a controller.

1334
01:02:55,089 --> 01:02:56,770
This is gonna like totally be a disaster

1335
01:02:56,770 --> 01:02:58,691
if we ever decide, mark a disaster, I just said,

1336
01:02:58,691 --> 01:03:01,532
if we ever have to sell it on the console.

1337
01:03:01,532 --> 01:03:02,893
But like, you know, doing, I mean,

1338
01:03:02,893 --> 01:03:04,394
it could potentially work, right?

1339
01:03:04,394 --> 01:03:05,855
Like you're not controlling units, right?

1340
01:03:06,495 --> 01:03:08,496
So you could make it work on a console,

1341
01:03:08,496 --> 01:03:10,376
you could make it work on a tablet, right?

1342
01:03:10,376 --> 01:03:12,337
I think there's good possibilities there.

1343
01:03:12,337 --> 01:03:14,457
I just think that you'd need to like,

1344
01:03:14,457 --> 01:03:18,078
kind of like rebuild part of the game from the ground up.

1345
01:03:18,078 --> 01:03:22,379
So yeah, I mean, I do think about it.

1346
01:03:22,379 --> 01:03:25,660
Like, it'd be kind of a neat project to take on.

1347
01:03:25,660 --> 01:03:28,121
But unfortunately we don't have anything happening right now.

1348
01:03:28,121 --> 01:03:28,401
So, thanks.

1349
01:03:28,401 --> 01:03:28,741
Thank you.

1350
01:03:28,741 --> 01:03:30,381
Over there.

1351
01:03:30,381 --> 01:03:31,782
Okay, yeah I was just wondering,

1352
01:03:31,782 --> 01:03:33,482
you created the game, this is your game.

1353
01:03:33,482 --> 01:03:35,863
Do you also help other people to build a game?

1354
01:03:36,340 --> 01:03:37,241
Are you for hire?

1355
01:03:37,241 --> 01:03:40,984
Wait, sorry, can you repeat that?

1356
01:03:40,984 --> 01:03:43,946
Okay, do you help other people create games?

1357
01:03:44,284 --> 01:03:46,925
Oh, do I help other people, you mean do I work on other teams

1358
01:03:46,925 --> 01:03:48,565
or consult or that type of thing?

1359
01:03:48,565 --> 01:03:50,665
Is that what you mean?

1360
01:03:50,665 --> 01:03:51,446
I mean, not very much.

1361
01:03:51,446 --> 01:03:57,107
I mean, I've written a lot about game design.

1362
01:03:57,107 --> 01:04:00,407
I do a game design podcast, Designer Notes,

1363
01:04:00,407 --> 01:04:01,308
where I talk to designers.

1364
01:04:01,308 --> 01:04:03,948
I mean, I try to spread game design information.

1365
01:04:03,948 --> 01:04:07,929
I mean, every once in a while, if there's a small project,

1366
01:04:07,929 --> 01:04:08,809
I mean, I have taken on, like,

1367
01:04:08,809 --> 01:04:09,769
work on something for a day or two

1368
01:04:09,769 --> 01:04:11,430
if someone just wants some feedback on the game.

1369
01:04:11,430 --> 01:04:13,490
So, I mean, I am open to stuff like that.

1370
01:04:14,030 --> 01:04:16,472
But when I work on a game, I have a hard time even,

1371
01:04:16,472 --> 01:04:18,093
I've never really even been able to work on two games

1372
01:04:18,093 --> 01:04:18,854
at once, right?

1373
01:04:18,854 --> 01:04:20,955
Like, I talk to people who work on three or four games

1374
01:04:20,955 --> 01:04:22,717
at the same time, and I find that amazing

1375
01:04:22,717 --> 01:04:24,478
that anyone can do that.

1376
01:04:24,478 --> 01:04:25,078
But thanks.

1377
01:04:25,078 --> 01:04:28,841
Do you attribute the success of the game

1378
01:04:28,841 --> 01:04:31,003
to being 3D versus being a 2D game?

1379
01:04:31,723 --> 01:04:33,464
I'm sorry, I couldn't help it.

1380
01:04:33,464 --> 01:04:34,025
The game is 3D.

1381
01:04:34,025 --> 01:04:36,286
Do you think that that was important

1382
01:04:36,286 --> 01:04:37,807
for the game to be successful?

1383
01:04:37,807 --> 01:04:39,468
Was the point of it being 3D?

1384
01:04:39,468 --> 01:04:42,751
So when I first did the prototype, it was actually 2D,

1385
01:04:42,751 --> 01:04:44,612
just because that was simple.

1386
01:04:44,612 --> 01:04:46,633
Well, it was like OpenGL, but like straight down,

1387
01:04:46,633 --> 01:04:48,855
but functionally it was 2D.

1388
01:04:48,855 --> 01:04:50,496
And you could make it just 2D,

1389
01:04:50,496 --> 01:04:52,558
but at this point I think the tools,

1390
01:04:52,558 --> 01:04:56,020
the best tools out there are 3D tools, right?

1391
01:04:56,020 --> 01:04:56,701
Like we use Unity.

1392
01:04:57,441 --> 01:04:58,602
which was great to develop in.

1393
01:04:58,602 --> 01:05:02,184
Basically because it has amazing art tools.

1394
01:05:02,184 --> 01:05:03,825
Like our artists were immediately,

1395
01:05:03,825 --> 01:05:06,767
I mean artists, I'm almost just artist, right?

1396
01:05:06,767 --> 01:05:10,769
Like the one main guy we had was able to become immediately

1397
01:05:10,769 --> 01:05:12,390
five times as more productive as he had been

1398
01:05:12,390 --> 01:05:13,311
before we jumped to Unity.

1399
01:05:13,311 --> 01:05:18,934
So, like, you know, 3D has gotten to the point

1400
01:05:18,934 --> 01:05:20,775
where it's just very easy to develop in 3D,

1401
01:05:20,775 --> 01:05:22,316
and if it was simpler to develop in 2D,

1402
01:05:22,316 --> 01:05:23,697
I probably would do 2D.

1403
01:05:23,697 --> 01:05:25,438
I don't think there's anything fundamentally about it

1404
01:05:25,438 --> 01:05:26,578
that would make it work one way or another.

1405
01:05:29,473 --> 01:05:33,977
My question is that with this game you're taking combat out of RTS.

1406
01:05:33,977 --> 01:05:34,537
Right.

1407
01:05:34,537 --> 01:05:42,844
You're playing with that notion. Are there any plans for Mohawk or you yourself to take on another genre and try to take out a core mechanic and see what you can do with it?

1408
01:05:42,844 --> 01:05:44,845
Well, that would that be our thing?

1409
01:05:48,315 --> 01:05:50,377
Once may be enough, it is a big challenge.

1410
01:05:50,377 --> 01:05:51,038
I'll say that.

1411
01:05:51,038 --> 01:05:55,323
Yeah, I mean, you know, I mean, to some extent,

1412
01:05:55,323 --> 01:05:57,905
this comes to the question of what you should do

1413
01:05:57,905 --> 01:06:00,027
as an independent developer, right?

1414
01:06:00,027 --> 01:06:02,230
Like, I love RTS games, but I'm never gonna be able

1415
01:06:02,230 --> 01:06:03,971
to take on StarCraft as a small team,

1416
01:06:03,971 --> 01:06:05,913
and that's just crazy, right?

1417
01:06:05,913 --> 01:06:08,276
So you have to do something radically different.

1418
01:06:08,596 --> 01:06:10,097
Right?

1419
01:06:10,097 --> 01:06:12,118
And so some of the games I showed you,

1420
01:06:12,118 --> 01:06:13,920
like Adam Zombie Smash was a great game of like,

1421
01:06:13,920 --> 01:06:15,340
that's an amazing RTS.

1422
01:06:15,340 --> 01:06:18,222
And you know, he just changed some of the basic assumptions

1423
01:06:18,222 --> 01:06:19,663
about how an RTS worked,

1424
01:06:19,663 --> 01:06:21,284
and was able to make a great game,

1425
01:06:21,284 --> 01:06:23,046
and he wasn't competing against anyone else.

1426
01:06:23,046 --> 01:06:24,987
And so that's the same basic idea

1427
01:06:24,987 --> 01:06:26,388
of what we're trying to do with Offworld.

1428
01:06:26,388 --> 01:06:29,450
So yeah, I mean, probably we'll always do that with games.

1429
01:06:29,450 --> 01:06:32,232
You know, like we're gonna have to figure out

1430
01:06:32,232 --> 01:06:34,253
how to make something that no one else is making.

1431
01:06:34,253 --> 01:06:35,594
I mean, I think that's what you have to do

1432
01:06:35,594 --> 01:06:36,395
as an independent developer.

1433
01:06:36,609 --> 01:06:38,571
Looking forward to the next experiment.

1434
01:06:38,571 --> 01:06:42,035
All right, thank you.

1435
01:06:42,035 --> 01:06:42,576
All right.

1436
01:06:42,576 --> 01:06:42,836
Whoops.

1437
01:06:42,836 --> 01:06:44,679
All right, looks like maybe one more.

1438
01:06:44,679 --> 01:06:45,720
Yeah, yeah.

1439
01:06:45,720 --> 01:06:46,041
Hello.

1440
01:06:46,041 --> 01:06:47,563
I figured out the question.

1441
01:06:47,563 --> 01:06:48,884
What do you think is the future of RTS?

1442
01:06:48,884 --> 01:06:50,346
The future of RTS.

1443
01:06:51,607 --> 01:06:54,808
You know, it's a hard question for me to answer

1444
01:06:54,808 --> 01:06:59,110
because I'm kind of done with traditional RTS games.

1445
01:06:59,110 --> 01:07:01,671
I don't really find them particularly enjoyable anymore

1446
01:07:01,671 --> 01:07:03,151
just because I play them so much.

1447
01:07:03,151 --> 01:07:05,472
So I hope the future of RTS games

1448
01:07:05,472 --> 01:07:06,853
is more games like Offworld, right?

1449
01:07:06,853 --> 01:07:09,814
Which are like, what I want is to play a game

1450
01:07:09,814 --> 01:07:11,674
that takes about 30 minutes,

1451
01:07:11,674 --> 01:07:13,735
that's strategic and competitive

1452
01:07:13,735 --> 01:07:15,956
and I can play with my friends, right?

1453
01:07:15,956 --> 01:07:16,896
That's what I want.

1454
01:07:17,557 --> 01:07:20,918
And Offworld delivers that in a way that's interesting.

1455
01:07:20,918 --> 01:07:23,299
And I don't want to do a Tank Rush anymore with my friends.

1456
01:07:23,299 --> 01:07:24,099
I want to do something different.

1457
01:07:24,099 --> 01:07:25,620
But I still love that format.

1458
01:07:25,620 --> 01:07:29,061
Just the basic idea of we're going to play this game over a

1459
01:07:29,061 --> 01:07:31,802
lunch break, and we're going to have this ups and downs.

1460
01:07:31,802 --> 01:07:34,023
And after the game, getting together and talking about

1461
01:07:34,023 --> 01:07:35,944
what happened is going to be amazing.

1462
01:07:35,944 --> 01:07:37,625
That's what I want out of an RTS game.

1463
01:07:38,785 --> 01:07:41,309
Is that going to happen? I don't know.

1464
01:07:41,309 --> 01:07:46,815
I think the traditional RTS is absolutely in danger.

1465
01:07:46,815 --> 01:07:49,218
And the big one there is because of MOBAs.

1466
01:07:49,218 --> 01:07:52,302
MOBAs have destroyed the traditional RTS game.

1467
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:58,129
Because RTS games as they are, are kind of terrible.

1468
01:07:58,890 --> 01:08:03,316
you're asking a player to control 100 units spread all over

1469
01:08:03,316 --> 01:08:08,143
the map and jump back and forth and pay attention to what

1470
01:08:08,143 --> 01:08:09,845
they're doing and what all their opponents are doing.

1471
01:08:09,845 --> 01:08:12,148
And it's amazing those games ever worked at all.

1472
01:08:12,148 --> 01:08:16,394
Like MOBAs are just the micro aspect of an RTS.

1473
01:08:16,754 --> 01:08:18,455
And so that's why people are like,

1474
01:08:18,455 --> 01:08:20,716
oh, this is really fun because now I actually feel like

1475
01:08:20,716 --> 01:08:22,117
I can handle this game.

1476
01:08:22,117 --> 01:08:23,998
Off-world is just the macro aspect of an RTS.

1477
01:08:23,998 --> 01:08:26,140
You know, we dropped all the micro parts.

1478
01:08:26,140 --> 01:08:27,581
You don't have to worry about units.

1479
01:08:27,581 --> 01:08:29,862
And because, so we, there's two games in there,

1480
01:08:29,862 --> 01:08:31,703
they're just half of a whole RTS,

1481
01:08:31,703 --> 01:08:34,004
which is a sign of just how complex

1482
01:08:34,004 --> 01:08:35,926
and overburdened those games tend to be.

1483
01:08:35,926 --> 01:08:38,347
So yeah, I don't think there's necessarily a big future

1484
01:08:38,347 --> 01:08:40,568
for the traditional RTS, but I love the format.

1485
01:08:40,748 --> 01:08:44,312
like playing a strategic game with your friends, 30 minutes,

1486
01:08:44,312 --> 01:08:45,553
up to eight players, something like that.

1487
01:08:45,553 --> 01:08:47,035
So I hope to see more.

1488
01:08:47,035 --> 01:08:47,355
Yeah, I agree.

1489
01:08:47,355 --> 01:08:47,876
Thank you.

1490
01:08:47,876 --> 01:08:48,997
All right, thanks.

1491
01:08:48,997 --> 01:08:50,999
All right, thanks for coming, everyone.
