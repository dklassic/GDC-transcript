1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:12,365
today and something that for a title I started to call the freedom fallacy and

2
00:00:12,405 --> 00:00:16,228
I'll give you a little background on how we're going to set the talk really it's

3
00:00:16,268 --> 00:00:20,911
a you know over the last decade two types of games have made the most money

4
00:00:20,951 --> 00:00:25,114
driven the most gamer hours and one is competitive multiplayer and the other is

5
00:00:25,494 --> 00:00:26,255
open-world genres

6
00:00:27,725 --> 00:00:32,328
And what we're going to do today, because we had to sort of pick a lane and then drive down it,

7
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:39,352
is that we're going to look at open world, because it's not that autonomy is only important in open world games.

8
00:00:39,893 --> 00:00:45,816
In fact, autonomy is probably the single most important player experience variable across all genres.

9
00:00:48,778 --> 00:00:49,739
Is the building okay?

10
00:00:50,839 --> 00:00:54,061
When I stopped, it stopped. I didn't realize I had that kind of power.

11
00:00:56,121 --> 00:01:00,223
But anyway, we're going to talk about open world games as a way of talking about autonomy,

12
00:01:00,543 --> 00:01:04,285
but the principles we're going to talk about today are highly applicable, really, regardless

13
00:01:04,305 --> 00:01:05,086
of what you're working on.

14
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:08,988
Just some quick background on me and my group and my company.

15
00:01:09,588 --> 00:01:12,270
I'm a behavioral scientist by training.

16
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:16,792
I focused a lot on motivation and emotion and understanding what were the different

17
00:01:16,832 --> 00:01:18,273
contexts and forces that would...

18
00:01:19,054 --> 00:01:22,516
motivate people both in high-quality ways and bad ways.

19
00:01:23,937 --> 00:01:27,280
And I did that work way back, I don't know, too long ago,

20
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:29,201
about 25 years ago is when I finished that.

21
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:31,103
And I immediately pivoted out of that

22
00:01:31,123 --> 00:01:34,225
and tried to start applying it to various work contexts

23
00:01:34,265 --> 00:01:37,167
and commercial contexts, one of them being video games.

24
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:39,429
And so we started doing that work about 15 years ago.

25
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:46,715
We then added to the team and Immersive Games, all the senior leadership are either researchers

26
00:01:46,755 --> 00:01:51,718
and people looking at motivation and good methodology or they're people that are coming

27
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:56,923
out of the industry who've had roles from studio head to producer to essentially everything

28
00:01:56,963 --> 00:01:57,603
in the food chain.

29
00:01:57,643 --> 00:02:02,847
And we really wanted to have both of those things in the organization to drive our culture

30
00:02:02,867 --> 00:02:07,151
and make sure that whatever we were doing, we wanted it to be valid.

31
00:02:07,831 --> 00:02:09,352
And we also want it to be practical.

32
00:02:09,952 --> 00:02:12,313
And so that's really what we are at our heart.

33
00:02:13,294 --> 00:02:15,535
So we do a tremendous amount of work on video games.

34
00:02:15,555 --> 00:02:20,137
We do probably 40 or 50 different research projects a year on video games.

35
00:02:20,177 --> 00:02:22,178
And we've been at this for about 15 years now.

36
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:26,902
We have a model called the Player Experience of Need Satisfaction model

37
00:02:27,302 --> 00:02:30,003
that I'm going to touch on today, and that's really at the heart

38
00:02:30,123 --> 00:02:31,303
of the stuff we're going to talk about.

39
00:02:31,443 --> 00:02:33,084
Autonomy is one of the things in that model.

40
00:02:34,424 --> 00:02:38,385
I did want to say that that model has a tremendous amount of validation,

41
00:02:38,425 --> 00:02:40,226
and I really just wanted to touch on that point

42
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:45,608
because you hear a lot of models when you're coming to GDC and out there.

43
00:02:45,648 --> 00:02:47,849
People are always being really creative about thinking about,

44
00:02:47,909 --> 00:02:50,069
what is it? We're all trying to understand our players.

45
00:02:51,370 --> 00:02:56,433
One of the things about our model is because of our pedigree in science and our disposition,

46
00:02:56,553 --> 00:03:01,856
we've taken it out and we've made it available for people at other academic institutions

47
00:03:01,916 --> 00:03:05,939
and basic scientists to independently test it because we really wanted to know, is it

48
00:03:05,979 --> 00:03:06,339
valid?

49
00:03:06,359 --> 00:03:06,799
Does it work?

50
00:03:07,439 --> 00:03:12,743
And there's a lot of literature validating it and so if people afterwards want a reading

51
00:03:12,783 --> 00:03:15,644
list or want some of that material, I'm happy to provide it.

52
00:03:16,525 --> 00:03:20,086
As I said, this model is called the Player Experience of Needs Satisfaction Model.

53
00:03:20,846 --> 00:03:25,767
I'm not going to be going into the components of it in a tremendous amount of detail because

54
00:03:25,867 --> 00:03:30,468
I've done that like 12 times over the last 10 GDCs.

55
00:03:30,828 --> 00:03:33,789
So there's a lot of stuff in the vault on the model.

56
00:03:35,029 --> 00:03:37,050
So if people want to get a lot of the background material.

57
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:39,650
But this is really kind of a, I don't know.

58
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:45,815
a level 200 or 300 course looking specifically at autonomy.

59
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:51,860
I do want to touch on the model briefly though as just a little bit of a cliff notes or a

60
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:52,421
primer.

61
00:03:53,862 --> 00:03:58,286
And the model really has at its core there are lots of different dimensions to it, but

62
00:03:58,346 --> 00:04:04,391
at its core it talks about the fact that all of us have basic psychological needs that

63
00:04:04,531 --> 00:04:07,313
we have are intrinsically motivated to have satisfied.

64
00:04:08,354 --> 00:04:09,695
and that move us forward.

65
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:12,296
In other words, we don't need anything external to us

66
00:04:12,356 --> 00:04:13,637
in order to motivate ourselves.

67
00:04:14,037 --> 00:04:16,398
We have things happening inside,

68
00:04:16,438 --> 00:04:20,000
and it's our philosophy, and the science bears this out,

69
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,501
that if you can create the circumstances

70
00:04:22,821 --> 00:04:25,523
that let me have those needs satisfied,

71
00:04:25,563 --> 00:04:27,224
you have reached the deepest,

72
00:04:27,304 --> 00:04:29,145
most powerful form of motivation.

73
00:04:29,165 --> 00:04:30,886
And of course, this is very important

74
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:32,726
in the video game space,

75
00:04:32,766 --> 00:04:34,908
because games are a discretionary activity.

76
00:04:34,968 --> 00:04:36,688
People do them because they want to do them,

77
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:37,529
and there's lots of.

78
00:04:38,129 --> 00:04:38,770
competition.

79
00:04:38,810 --> 00:04:42,792
And so being able to develop that deep, high-quality motivation is really essential.

80
00:04:43,172 --> 00:04:46,394
So just quickly, those three needs are the need for autonomy, which we're going to

81
00:04:46,434 --> 00:04:47,294
talk about a lot today.

82
00:04:47,914 --> 00:04:52,877
That's in short our desire to feel like we're writing our own story in life, that

83
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:57,639
we're agentic about what we're doing, and that we're endorsing the path that we're

84
00:04:57,759 --> 00:04:57,860
on.

85
00:04:58,040 --> 00:05:00,741
And as we'll see, I'm going to use a word a lot today called volition.

86
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:02,302
We're going to get to that in just a few minutes.

87
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:05,523
The second need is the need for relatedness.

88
00:05:06,124 --> 00:05:07,844
This is our desire to feel like we belong,

89
00:05:08,325 --> 00:05:10,365
we're connected to others, that I matter to you,

90
00:05:10,546 --> 00:05:11,326
and you matter to me.

91
00:05:12,226 --> 00:05:13,747
And the third is a need for competence,

92
00:05:13,807 --> 00:05:15,188
or sometimes we call it mastery.

93
00:05:15,628 --> 00:05:18,389
And this is our desire to feel successful and effective

94
00:05:18,409 --> 00:05:19,089
in what we're doing,

95
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:22,271
and also to feel like we're growing and elaborating ourselves,

96
00:05:22,331 --> 00:05:26,553
and we're reaching more and more abilities and experiences.

97
00:05:27,385 --> 00:05:29,687
So these are the three core needs, and I'll be referencing back to them.

98
00:05:29,727 --> 00:05:34,510
Today we're really going to focus on the primary need for autonomy.

99
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,792
And it's because this is really the foundation,

100
00:05:38,292 --> 00:05:40,554
core foundation of what makes modern games work.

101
00:05:42,095 --> 00:05:43,876
Now I bet if I said to everybody here,

102
00:05:44,617 --> 00:05:45,917
do you know what autonomy is?

103
00:05:46,927 --> 00:05:48,788
Everybody would say that they did know what autonomy was,

104
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:51,030
because it's a pretty common word.

105
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:52,631
It's not like a 50 cent word.

106
00:05:53,311 --> 00:05:54,152
We hear it all the time.

107
00:05:55,132 --> 00:05:58,075
And developers design using a general sense for autonomy

108
00:05:58,095 --> 00:05:58,575
all the time.

109
00:05:59,255 --> 00:06:00,957
It's like, OK, I need to give my player

110
00:06:00,997 --> 00:06:02,137
this thing called autonomy.

111
00:06:02,578 --> 00:06:05,620
So I'm going to insert your custom recipe right here.

112
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,602
The problem is that, or the challenge is,

113
00:06:09,102 --> 00:06:10,764
that autonomy is a very complex.

114
00:06:11,687 --> 00:06:15,469
construct and misunderstanding it can backfire.

115
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,312
And I'm gonna tell actual case examples

116
00:06:19,392 --> 00:06:22,114
as we go along here of how that's happened.

117
00:06:23,075 --> 00:06:24,856
So what we wanna do today,

118
00:06:25,176 --> 00:06:26,297
now since the doors are closed,

119
00:06:26,337 --> 00:06:28,239
what we wanna do is we wanna science this up

120
00:06:28,859 --> 00:06:31,441
so that we can help everybody understand autonomy.

121
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:33,963
Not just make autonomy but the blue autonomy

122
00:06:34,803 --> 00:06:36,485
so that you can dominate the market.

123
00:06:38,068 --> 00:06:41,031
So it's really understandable, by the way, that autonomy is misunderstood

124
00:06:41,071 --> 00:06:46,475
because the dictionary doesn't even get it right from the standpoint of psychology.

125
00:06:46,555 --> 00:06:51,859
If you look at definitions of autonomy, you see that lots of words like freedom

126
00:06:52,820 --> 00:06:56,502
and independence and freedom and independence. It's just sort of everywhere.

127
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:59,945
And there's a reason that it's like that and why it makes sense

128
00:06:59,965 --> 00:07:04,028
because that definition works for, let's say, if you're talking about countries.

129
00:07:04,068 --> 00:07:06,610
If you're talking about Australia or you're talking about Bolivia.

130
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:08,992
except this isn't really Bolivia, this is Paraguay.

131
00:07:09,012 --> 00:07:15,076
I'm sorry, we just have John Oliver fans on our staff

132
00:07:15,096 --> 00:07:16,297
that helped me put this deck together.

133
00:07:18,138 --> 00:07:21,161
And maybe most apropos for this, the best example for this audience would be,

134
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:22,141
you know, Naboo.

135
00:07:22,742 --> 00:07:25,344
But, you know, it's okay if we talk about countries in this way

136
00:07:25,424 --> 00:07:29,246
or if more and more you're hearing about autonomous cars

137
00:07:29,327 --> 00:07:31,208
and different technologies, and it makes sense

138
00:07:31,228 --> 00:07:32,569
that when we're talking about those things,

139
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:35,991
you know, that independence maybe is the right thing.

140
00:07:36,675 --> 00:07:42,701
term. But when we're talking about people, it doesn't apply. We're complex. We have consciousness,

141
00:07:43,061 --> 00:07:49,307
right? I mean, I don't mean to get too Cartesian about the whole thing, but we have a will and a

142
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:56,033
self, and that creates a lot of complexity when we're trying to understand the notion of autonomy.

143
00:07:56,914 --> 00:08:03,736
And so what I want to do right up front is pivot us from the idea that autonomy is about freedom or independence

144
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:09,618
to this definition which is autonomy means that when we act, we do so volitionally.

145
00:08:09,658 --> 00:08:14,040
This is the new synonym I want to give for autonomy here.

146
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:19,762
And volition isn't independence or freedom to do whatever you want.

147
00:08:21,643 --> 00:08:25,565
Volition is wanting to do the things that you are doing. Right?

148
00:08:29,339 --> 00:08:30,239
God bless the internet.

149
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:37,261
So the freedom fallacy, as I said in the title,

150
00:08:37,582 --> 00:08:40,062
is that autonomy equals freedom, that freedom

151
00:08:40,122 --> 00:08:41,463
is a synonym for autonomy.

152
00:08:42,443 --> 00:08:45,044
In reality, autonomy equals volition.

153
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:50,005
And I'm going to give some proof here from everyday life.

154
00:08:52,654 --> 00:08:57,015
There are many ways that we freely relinquish freedom in our lives.

155
00:08:57,035 --> 00:09:02,176
So if we think about autonomy as freedom, that thesis gets disproven in the way that

156
00:09:02,216 --> 00:09:03,837
we actually act and go about our lives.

157
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:12,039
So probably the biggest one is we meet people, we fall in love, and we get married.

158
00:09:12,159 --> 00:09:14,600
And so then freedom actually goes down.

159
00:09:15,652 --> 00:09:18,754
We can no longer stay up until the middle of the night, or at least I can't.

160
00:09:19,314 --> 00:09:20,535
But things change.

161
00:09:21,656 --> 00:09:27,119
But interestingly, our volition goes up, and our sense of agency, and that we're writing

162
00:09:27,159 --> 00:09:30,942
our personal narrative, and that sense of autonomy, those things go up, even though

163
00:09:30,962 --> 00:09:31,722
we've given up freedom.

164
00:09:32,042 --> 00:09:34,684
And then, of course, that story only gets more complex.

165
00:09:34,824 --> 00:09:35,144
But again, it's...

166
00:09:39,702 --> 00:09:44,469
This is what somebody with a small child puts us into every deck, maybe in a few years I

167
00:09:44,529 --> 00:09:48,876
won't but, but you know it's the most wonderful thing but it's also a tremendous, we're tremendously

168
00:09:48,916 --> 00:09:49,597
giving up freedom.

169
00:09:50,438 --> 00:09:54,585
So if we think about it as if from a freedom standpoint we have a problem.

170
00:09:55,486 --> 00:09:57,727
But when we think about it from a volitional standpoint,

171
00:09:57,767 --> 00:09:59,748
remember we have multiple basic needs.

172
00:10:00,669 --> 00:10:02,830
It's not just that we want to be the authors of our lives.

173
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,312
We want to actually do something in those lives.

174
00:10:05,932 --> 00:10:09,314
We want to have needs satisfied for belongingness

175
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:12,055
and connection and growth and all of these different things.

176
00:10:12,716 --> 00:10:16,058
And so all of those needs drive volitional behavior.

177
00:10:16,318 --> 00:10:17,979
And when that happens, we feel agentic.

178
00:10:18,861 --> 00:10:21,603
And we feel like we are authoring our lives in a much fuller way

179
00:10:22,184 --> 00:10:26,207
than if we were simply behaving independently or behaving with freedom.

180
00:10:26,607 --> 00:10:29,770
So we create in our own lives structures and all these other things

181
00:10:30,170 --> 00:10:32,612
that are rich with need satisfaction.

182
00:10:33,193 --> 00:10:36,435
And it's that idea that's the overarching thing I want to talk about today.

183
00:10:36,555 --> 00:10:38,117
Is that really when we're talking about,

184
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:41,179
we're going to look at it in open world games, but we're looking in games,

185
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:44,162
it's not creating freedom, let players do whatever they want,

186
00:10:44,182 --> 00:10:45,062
give them independence.

187
00:10:45,763 --> 00:10:53,706
It's about creating that need satisfying structure, content, and systems so that they are volitionally

188
00:10:53,746 --> 00:10:55,367
engaged and deeply satisfied.

189
00:10:57,208 --> 00:11:02,950
And these needs are really the three channels for building that volitional engagement and

190
00:11:02,990 --> 00:11:03,690
satisfaction.

191
00:11:05,471 --> 00:11:09,553
So that's just a little bit of a kind of run up to how we're going to think about autonomy,

192
00:11:09,913 --> 00:11:13,715
but let's start talking a little bit about what does this mean for games.

193
00:11:16,148 --> 00:11:21,673
Well, the first thing is that there are some sacred cows out there, debates that, you know,

194
00:11:21,753 --> 00:11:27,078
I think have started to change, but certainly were red hot, you know, years ago before,

195
00:11:27,098 --> 00:11:30,741
you know, single player games started to become less and less popular.

196
00:11:30,762 --> 00:11:35,466
This whole thing about, well, players really want good story, and it's my job, I need to

197
00:11:35,566 --> 00:11:38,809
give them an experience, you know, I'm going to give them some choices, but it's really

198
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:39,870
about giving them experience.

199
00:11:40,245 --> 00:11:41,145
And then there are other people like, no,

200
00:11:41,165 --> 00:11:42,767
like here are all these examples

201
00:11:42,807 --> 00:11:44,928
where you need to give them freedom, right?

202
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,029
Because that's what players want,

203
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:47,930
where they want to create their own stories.

204
00:11:48,591 --> 00:11:50,833
And the reality is that that's a false dichotomy.

205
00:11:51,553 --> 00:11:53,655
Players, everybody is right in that scenario.

206
00:11:53,995 --> 00:11:55,916
The thing that unifies it is if you think about it

207
00:11:55,996 --> 00:11:57,958
as volition, if you think about it as

208
00:11:58,058 --> 00:11:59,999
how do we satisfy players' needs,

209
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,541
the reality is, and we're gonna see this in games,

210
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:07,065
that there are components of narrative and...

211
00:12:07,565 --> 00:12:10,466
and rich narrative that's written by you guys

212
00:12:11,186 --> 00:12:15,908
that we're drawing players into through a focus on need satisfaction

213
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:20,509
and then there's also satisfaction through more open, choiceful mechanics

214
00:12:20,970 --> 00:12:24,691
that we think about more traditionally as the purview of open world games.

215
00:12:26,382 --> 00:12:30,528
And another thing is that I always hear terms that trouble me a little bit.

216
00:12:30,588 --> 00:12:32,090
So the whole idea of sandbox games.

217
00:12:32,110 --> 00:12:33,572
I know sandbox games are a thing.

218
00:12:33,612 --> 00:12:37,998
And I don't have time today to go into when sandbox works.

219
00:12:38,439 --> 00:12:40,181
But a lot of times the idea of sandbox...

220
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:44,044
they can really turn into motivational sand traps.

221
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:45,165
Because you sit there and you're like,

222
00:12:45,185 --> 00:12:46,526
I'm going to build this experience,

223
00:12:46,806 --> 00:12:48,648
I'm going to put all these activities in there,

224
00:12:49,188 --> 00:12:51,070
but I don't think about the question of

225
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,772
what am I going to do in order to build volition

226
00:12:53,812 --> 00:12:55,853
and not just provide all of these things

227
00:12:56,333 --> 00:12:58,915
for people to do in the sandbox

228
00:12:58,935 --> 00:13:00,757
and then expect them to go out and do that.

229
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:03,699
And so even successful games

230
00:13:04,719 --> 00:13:06,080
make this mistake quite frequently.

231
00:13:08,421 --> 00:13:11,123
You can see examples in almost every successful game out there.

232
00:13:11,163 --> 00:13:13,885
So you can take Red Dead Redemption.

233
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:16,607
And this is, of course, a story where you're John Marston.

234
00:13:17,728 --> 00:13:20,430
You're bringing your own brand of justice to the West.

235
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,871
You know, this is powerful.

236
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:26,395
And the way you're going to do that is sitting at a wood table

237
00:13:26,415 --> 00:13:30,998
and making sure you don't cut off your own finger.

238
00:13:31,018 --> 00:13:33,100
Or your Altair.

239
00:13:34,743 --> 00:13:40,044
People whisper throughout Italy in hushed tones of your incredible ability to clean

240
00:13:40,084 --> 00:13:40,945
up after the pigeons.

241
00:13:43,285 --> 00:13:48,587
Or you're these guys, cyber super hackers.

242
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:52,308
I don't know what the tagline is for these guys, but they look pretty badass, right?

243
00:13:53,508 --> 00:13:57,049
It doesn't seem like they're going to take down the system by playing chess in the park.

244
00:13:58,871 --> 00:14:01,832
particularly if they're doing it with an analog speed clock,

245
00:14:01,872 --> 00:14:03,972
which seems a little unusual for a hacker.

246
00:14:04,292 --> 00:14:06,433
Anyway, I don't mean to pick on these things.

247
00:14:08,374 --> 00:14:10,534
What I'm trying to bring up is all games do this

248
00:14:10,574 --> 00:14:12,095
because when you build a big world,

249
00:14:12,835 --> 00:14:16,136
on the checklist is I have to put things into that world

250
00:14:16,176 --> 00:14:16,816
for people to do.

251
00:14:16,856 --> 00:14:18,737
What are people gonna do in this world?

252
00:14:19,297 --> 00:14:20,317
And that's the right idea.

253
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:22,778
But the issue is you need to ask the question,

254
00:14:23,218 --> 00:14:24,738
do these things build volition?

255
00:14:25,623 --> 00:14:30,950
Are they helping the player to create their own agentic player narrative where they feel

256
00:14:31,651 --> 00:14:33,854
need satisfaction in those things?

257
00:14:33,914 --> 00:14:37,759
And if those activities are not, are just things out there for someone to do but are

258
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:42,104
decoupled from any need satisfaction point.

259
00:14:42,785 --> 00:14:45,907
then they're not going to be activities that the player engages in.

260
00:14:46,248 --> 00:14:50,031
And so one thing that I always recommend when we're talking to developers

261
00:14:50,071 --> 00:14:51,652
is when you're thinking about these systems,

262
00:14:51,692 --> 00:14:52,833
when you're thinking about content,

263
00:14:52,853 --> 00:14:54,574
when you're thinking about all these necessary ways

264
00:14:54,614 --> 00:14:57,076
to layer in this activity into a game,

265
00:14:57,657 --> 00:14:59,138
to include this on your checklist.

266
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:03,521
You know, how are you building volition in engaging in the activity?

267
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:07,203
One thing that's really promising, though, about this idea

268
00:15:07,604 --> 00:15:10,644
and the pivoting from freedom to volition

269
00:15:11,625 --> 00:15:14,805
is we no longer have to be afraid of structure

270
00:15:16,006 --> 00:15:18,686
and kind of directing players to do things.

271
00:15:18,866 --> 00:15:20,927
It's okay to direct players to do things.

272
00:15:21,007 --> 00:15:23,208
As a matter of fact, in all the research that we've done,

273
00:15:23,268 --> 00:15:24,528
both in games and out of games,

274
00:15:25,168 --> 00:15:29,209
structure is better than providing open and free environments

275
00:15:29,429 --> 00:15:31,470
in satisfying people's needs for autonomy.

276
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:33,310
And this relates right back to the point I made.

277
00:15:34,190 --> 00:15:37,975
with the example of people getting married and doing all these things is that when you

278
00:15:38,015 --> 00:15:44,202
provide structure, you're essentially communicating to them, here are pathways, here are ways

279
00:15:44,242 --> 00:15:46,144
in which you can have your needs satisfied.

280
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,946
You can engage in these activities.

281
00:15:48,687 --> 00:15:49,548
You can engage in them.

282
00:15:49,688 --> 00:15:51,831
By the way, the structure of this activity is

283
00:15:52,652 --> 00:15:56,434
you know, you can do a bigger sandcastle if you are doing it with another player.

284
00:15:56,494 --> 00:15:59,215
So there's opportunities to, you know, satisfy relatedness.

285
00:15:59,235 --> 00:15:59,856
There's opportunities.

286
00:16:00,296 --> 00:16:04,598
It's creating those structures that act and that telegraph or communicate

287
00:16:05,319 --> 00:16:08,260
need satisfaction that actually build that volitional engagement

288
00:16:08,981 --> 00:16:12,503
and not just giving them a lot of freedom to do whatever they want to do.

289
00:16:13,003 --> 00:16:14,244
Even if the game is enormous.

290
00:16:16,068 --> 00:16:17,608
and it's filled with tons of activities,

291
00:16:18,389 --> 00:16:21,530
it doesn't matter if the player doesn't see meaning

292
00:16:21,590 --> 00:16:23,351
in the options that are in front of them, right?

293
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:27,052
So in Far Cry 3, I'm just picking one at random.

294
00:16:27,172 --> 00:16:30,173
I'm trying to pick from a variety of different games.

295
00:16:31,414 --> 00:16:34,855
There's the opportunity to go kill water buffaloes,

296
00:16:35,875 --> 00:16:37,616
you know, so that you can get crafting materials.

297
00:16:38,957 --> 00:16:41,097
And of course, when you first go to do this,

298
00:16:41,278 --> 00:16:42,978
this has a meaning.

299
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:48,002
It has meaning in building volition because there are needs being satisfied.

300
00:16:48,182 --> 00:16:51,944
You know, you have the ability to craft materials and make different things, which gives you

301
00:16:51,984 --> 00:16:54,946
meaningful choice, which makes you more agentic, which satisfies autonomy.

302
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:58,748
You also are crafting things that help to increase your ability and power, which is

303
00:16:58,788 --> 00:17:00,088
helping growth and efficacy.

304
00:17:01,169 --> 00:17:02,450
So you have autonomy and competence.

305
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:05,071
I don't think there's any relatedness needs in shooting the water buffalo.

306
00:17:05,091 --> 00:17:05,711
I don't really know.

307
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,641
So that's the thing is in this formula, it doesn't mean you've got to hit every need every single time

308
00:17:12,201 --> 00:17:16,542
But you can see that you can the way I just did you can look at any activity and try to tear it down about

309
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,643
What is going to be the experience in terms of need satisfaction that builds volition?

310
00:17:21,263 --> 00:17:26,764
And the problem here is that once you get the thing that'll that that and so it's no longer relevant

311
00:17:27,184 --> 00:17:34,505
You still have all these water buffaloes on the map, but essentially you've you've lost any support for volitional engagement in that activity

312
00:17:35,502 --> 00:17:38,665
And what happens then is you still got a map with a lot of water buffaloes on it,

313
00:17:39,025 --> 00:17:42,069
but now all these things that are so-called opportunities for action

314
00:17:42,129 --> 00:17:45,172
or things that you want to do, these are really just points of noise.

315
00:17:46,494 --> 00:17:48,035
They aren't really opportunities.

316
00:17:49,317 --> 00:17:53,141
So the key is not just to offer more things

317
00:17:53,421 --> 00:17:54,683
and fill up the world with things to do.

318
00:17:56,207 --> 00:17:59,229
It's certainly more is better, but it's most important that,

319
00:17:59,429 --> 00:18:02,130
however much you have, you need to have a dense network

320
00:18:02,711 --> 00:18:04,012
of things that matter to people,

321
00:18:04,472 --> 00:18:06,533
because that's what drives volitional engagement.

322
00:18:06,573 --> 00:18:08,174
Now, just as a little sidebar,

323
00:18:09,334 --> 00:18:11,796
you hear this all the time, you want meaningful activities,

324
00:18:11,816 --> 00:18:13,016
you need things that matter,

325
00:18:13,036 --> 00:18:14,397
you need things that people value.

326
00:18:15,218 --> 00:18:17,739
We're always, I mean, nobody describes their game

327
00:18:17,799 --> 00:18:19,520
as it's a game full of experiences.

328
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,121
They say it's a game full of great experiences,

329
00:18:22,161 --> 00:18:24,263
it's a game full of meaningful experiences.

330
00:18:24,925 --> 00:18:27,586
But when you look at those words, again,

331
00:18:27,646 --> 00:18:30,066
as a behavioral psychologist, I'm like, OK, well,

332
00:18:30,086 --> 00:18:31,887
how are we going to define what those words mean?

333
00:18:32,767 --> 00:18:34,907
There are many different ways you could do that.

334
00:18:35,287 --> 00:18:39,808
But really, when I'm talking about meaningful experiences,

335
00:18:40,188 --> 00:18:43,269
valued experiences, it really does all come back to,

336
00:18:44,149 --> 00:18:45,510
are these needs being satisfied?

337
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:47,070
And I say that because we've just

338
00:18:47,110 --> 00:18:49,790
collected a lot of data to see that that works really

339
00:18:49,830 --> 00:18:50,190
strongly.

340
00:18:50,410 --> 00:18:52,451
Other things may work, but we know this works really well.

341
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,382
So I want to next take a little bit of time and go through

342
00:18:58,403 --> 00:19:01,745
some of the ways that modern games and leading games,

343
00:19:01,785 --> 00:19:05,248
overworld games right now, are building volition

344
00:19:05,328 --> 00:19:07,549
and deeply satisfying autonomy,

345
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:10,832
because even though the ingredients may be the same,

346
00:19:10,992 --> 00:19:12,553
autonomy, competence, relatedness,

347
00:19:13,554 --> 00:19:14,574
the formulas can change.

348
00:19:14,614 --> 00:19:18,157
There's a lot of opportunity to be very creative

349
00:19:18,197 --> 00:19:19,458
in how these things get satisfied.

350
00:19:21,479 --> 00:19:22,100
So the first is,

351
00:19:23,340 --> 00:19:25,222
you know, what we call the amusement park structure.

352
00:19:26,302 --> 00:19:29,944
And this is really invented and forever dominated by

353
00:19:30,805 --> 00:19:33,567
the game that essentially created the open world genre,

354
00:19:33,607 --> 00:19:35,168
you could argue, which is Grand Theft Auto.

355
00:19:36,462 --> 00:19:40,562
And the reason for our structure is, you know, operates on a pretty simple premise,

356
00:19:41,223 --> 00:19:44,163
which is build a dense world of satisfying rides, right?

357
00:19:44,203 --> 00:19:47,844
So when you are engaged in the narratives in Grand Theft Auto,

358
00:19:48,204 --> 00:19:50,224
you're not, it's not really your narrative.

359
00:19:50,404 --> 00:19:52,805
You know, you're switching characters, you're engaging different stories,

360
00:19:53,125 --> 00:19:57,926
but you're getting exposed to this world and these opportunities of things

361
00:19:58,046 --> 00:20:01,606
that have meaningful value in that when you engage in them.

362
00:20:02,739 --> 00:20:05,804
there you know you're conquering challenges you're

363
00:20:07,426 --> 00:20:10,350
these are not these are good rides right. And because there's

364
00:20:10,470 --> 00:20:13,554
enough of a spectrum of these good rides it's actually very

365
00:20:13,595 --> 00:20:15,858
needs satisfying and you feel a sense of meaningful choice.

366
00:20:16,672 --> 00:20:17,992
So this is all building volition.

367
00:20:18,313 --> 00:20:22,075
So GTA doesn't win because it's really big

368
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:23,456
and there's lots of things to do.

369
00:20:23,556 --> 00:20:26,818
And I mean, whenever any open world game starts to come out,

370
00:20:27,298 --> 00:20:29,519
people start, one of the metrics that people

371
00:20:29,539 --> 00:20:30,960
start talking about is how big it is.

372
00:20:31,741 --> 00:20:34,142
Well, we discovered you can take the last version

373
00:20:34,162 --> 00:20:37,164
of our game and fit it into a map that's 10 times as big.

374
00:20:38,065 --> 00:20:40,006
And everybody gets very excited about that.

375
00:20:41,262 --> 00:20:43,062
And the reason people get excited about that is

376
00:20:43,983 --> 00:20:47,344
one of the ways that players assume that they're going to have all kinds of autonomy

377
00:20:48,145 --> 00:20:50,526
is it's big, because they give you the benefit of the doubt

378
00:20:51,066 --> 00:20:52,927
that no matter how big it is, it's going to be awesome.

379
00:20:54,748 --> 00:20:58,509
So, that's kind of, I guess, a good thing,

380
00:20:58,949 --> 00:21:01,611
but it also creates a very high bar to clear.

381
00:21:02,711 --> 00:21:05,632
So, you get a lot of freedom, but you also have all of these really

382
00:21:06,453 --> 00:21:09,054
enjoyable and meaningful activities in GTA.

383
00:21:09,394 --> 00:21:10,755
But what GTA lacks...

384
00:21:12,058 --> 00:21:14,179
are rich opportunities for growth.

385
00:21:14,199 --> 00:21:15,780
It doesn't have RPG mechanics.

386
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,961
Or again, I'm talking about early GTA.

387
00:21:18,702 --> 00:21:22,403
I know there's multiplayer and all these other things now.

388
00:21:22,443 --> 00:21:25,485
I'm just trying to lay out a little bit

389
00:21:25,525 --> 00:21:28,826
of the fundamental DNA of the game.

390
00:21:29,527 --> 00:21:31,648
And what it lacks really are rich opportunities for growth

391
00:21:31,688 --> 00:21:33,249
and also for creating a player's story.

392
00:21:33,729 --> 00:21:36,290
Because the whole idea of a player narrative

393
00:21:37,274 --> 00:21:41,416
The player narrative is really critical because that's how players integrate and amplify volition.

394
00:21:42,056 --> 00:21:45,498
We're engaged in a personal narrative all the time.

395
00:21:46,758 --> 00:21:49,459
And when we go into games, that narrative just continues.

396
00:21:52,268 --> 00:21:54,830
These narratives will ideally reflect the player's self,

397
00:21:55,090 --> 00:21:56,111
interests, and values.

398
00:21:56,751 --> 00:22:00,213
And games can build volition by giving players

399
00:22:00,293 --> 00:22:04,496
the appropriate tools in order to build those narratives.

400
00:22:05,297 --> 00:22:07,258
And so what we see in GTA is we don't

401
00:22:07,338 --> 00:22:09,779
see a lot of rich building blocks for that.

402
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:14,063
amusement park structures are relatively thin, but they do give

403
00:22:15,344 --> 00:22:18,647
kind of words and verbs. I'm in a bowl. I'm a triathlete.

404
00:22:18,687 --> 00:22:24,613
I'm gonna be in a drag race. And so the player then has to assemble, you know, essentially a narrative about, well

405
00:22:24,733 --> 00:22:30,198
I'm a really, I'm like the most awesome drag racer, you know, in GTA or, you know, they're assembling a narrative.

406
00:22:30,918 --> 00:22:33,861
But, you know, it's really, it's relatively thin. And so

407
00:22:34,912 --> 00:22:37,894
When we then start to look at some other examples of how

408
00:22:37,914 --> 00:22:40,235
needs get satisfied in open worlds, we start to see

409
00:22:40,896 --> 00:22:43,237
how people turn the knobs on some of these things

410
00:22:43,277 --> 00:22:45,018
in order to increase volitional engagement.

411
00:22:47,260 --> 00:22:49,121
So the next thing I want to turn to is an approach

412
00:22:49,141 --> 00:22:50,842
called the dense RPG approach.

413
00:22:51,823 --> 00:22:54,084
And a good representative for this is Skyrim.

414
00:22:55,626 --> 00:22:58,668
People have played the hell out of Skyrim for a lot of hours

415
00:22:58,728 --> 00:22:59,928
over a very long period of time.

416
00:22:59,968 --> 00:23:02,630
It has a very high level of sustained engagement

417
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:03,631
and volitional engagement.

418
00:23:05,765 --> 00:23:17,052
And Skyrim really wins because they have incredibly rich RPG systems that deepen volition by empowering growth and providing richer narrative threads.

419
00:23:17,352 --> 00:23:21,174
They're giving much longer narrative threads than you would in an amusement park structure, right?

420
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:25,037
So there's just a staggering amount of things that you can do.

421
00:23:26,137 --> 00:23:26,798
when you're in the game.

422
00:23:27,579 --> 00:23:32,003
And this results in more elements of need satisfaction

423
00:23:32,043 --> 00:23:33,504
in order to build volition.

424
00:23:33,524 --> 00:23:35,005
You've got more meaningful choice,

425
00:23:35,766 --> 00:23:39,749
but you also now have the ability to build agentic narratives

426
00:23:39,829 --> 00:23:41,491
because you've got all these narrative threads

427
00:23:41,511 --> 00:23:44,393
that you can begin to stitch together to build your narrative.

428
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,156
These are not things that are really present in the amusement park structure.

429
00:23:47,596 --> 00:23:48,437
That builds volition.

430
00:23:49,137 --> 00:23:53,238
The other thing is that you're not just looking at issues of overcoming challenges

431
00:23:53,278 --> 00:23:56,859
and feeling that moment-to-moment satisfaction of competence,

432
00:23:57,359 --> 00:24:00,499
you're also engaging in growth through the RPG mechanics.

433
00:24:01,359 --> 00:24:04,480
And that is one of the most powerful ways to build volition

434
00:24:04,520 --> 00:24:06,560
if you create that meaningful sense of growth in games.

435
00:24:06,920 --> 00:24:09,481
So Skyrim, again, using the same ingredients,

436
00:24:10,001 --> 00:24:14,041
but they're essentially putting them in in different degrees

437
00:24:14,102 --> 00:24:17,322
and creating different systems in order to build volitional engagement.

438
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:24,265
The main volitional hook of course is this growth and it's integrated with a massive

439
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:27,726
quest system but I would say that one of the things that's great about it is that when

440
00:24:27,746 --> 00:24:30,807
you engage in quests and you do things, it has an impact on you.

441
00:24:31,388 --> 00:24:37,870
So your personal narrative to be a vampire, you can actually change who you are and become

442
00:24:37,890 --> 00:24:38,351
a vampire.

443
00:24:38,371 --> 00:24:45,654
So there's this impact of systems as you make your choices that truly make the character

444
00:24:45,714 --> 00:24:46,654
that you're building your own.

445
00:24:48,916 --> 00:24:51,857
which is really powerful volitionally.

446
00:24:52,277 --> 00:24:55,418
You've got in Skyrim something you don't have in GTA,

447
00:24:55,778 --> 00:24:57,479
which is you get full sentences.

448
00:24:57,779 --> 00:24:59,860
I'm the head of the Witcher's College,

449
00:24:59,900 --> 00:25:01,160
I'm the leader of the Thieves' Guild,

450
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:03,181
I suck blood of sleeping villagers.

451
00:25:03,201 --> 00:25:04,641
I now have these larger chunks

452
00:25:04,901 --> 00:25:06,402
with which to build my player narrative.

453
00:25:07,642 --> 00:25:09,803
And so all of these things have meaningful impact

454
00:25:10,783 --> 00:25:12,124
on the actual character themselves.

455
00:25:12,164 --> 00:25:15,225
But there's one thing that is missing from this,

456
00:25:16,025 --> 00:25:16,585
which is that

457
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:21,266
In the end, nothing really matters, no matter what you decide to do.

458
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:25,208
You could be a werewolf, vampire, cat, person who, I don't know,

459
00:25:25,348 --> 00:25:26,789
could fill in sentences here.

460
00:25:27,409 --> 00:25:32,652
Whatever you decide to do, you don't have this major,

461
00:25:32,732 --> 00:25:36,254
this main storyline that you're shifting or adapting.

462
00:25:36,934 --> 00:25:38,535
There's no epic impact on the world.

463
00:25:38,635 --> 00:25:40,796
Really, the impact is just building a narrative yourself.

464
00:25:41,994 --> 00:25:45,177
So that's very, it's a very powerful game,

465
00:25:45,598 --> 00:25:47,920
but I want to turn now to another formula

466
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:50,162
that's out there in order to build autonomy

467
00:25:50,202 --> 00:25:51,564
and build volitional engagement.

468
00:25:52,404 --> 00:25:54,106
And that's the idea of narrative impact.

469
00:25:55,548 --> 00:25:57,670
So the representative game we're gonna pull here

470
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,191
is Mass Effect.

471
00:26:00,512 --> 00:26:01,333
So Mass Effect.

472
00:26:02,474 --> 00:26:07,276
The main volitional hook, the main thing that makes me feel agentic and engaged in what

473
00:26:07,296 --> 00:26:12,499
I'm doing and need satisfied in what I'm doing is not just I can change the world, I can

474
00:26:12,559 --> 00:26:13,600
change the universe.

475
00:26:16,213 --> 00:26:20,376
And so they're spreading out across multiple needs, various satisfactions.

476
00:26:20,436 --> 00:26:22,277
So you're getting meaningful choice.

477
00:26:22,737 --> 00:26:23,598
You probably can't notice it.

478
00:26:23,638 --> 00:26:28,540
It's slightly less meaningful choice, but you're instead of making meaningful choices

479
00:26:28,600 --> 00:26:34,023
amongst little tributaries and rivers of things that are going on, as you would in Skyrim,

480
00:26:34,043 --> 00:26:36,104
you're making choices between these sort of deep...

481
00:26:36,705 --> 00:26:38,686
you know, these deep rivers that go very...

482
00:26:38,966 --> 00:26:41,448
and they're all, like, coming towards the ocean

483
00:26:41,508 --> 00:26:42,929
and you have a sense of epic scale.

484
00:26:43,249 --> 00:26:45,891
And this is rendered in the content

485
00:26:46,071 --> 00:26:48,673
and in the cinematics and in all of these things, right?

486
00:26:49,053 --> 00:26:51,015
So you feel this deep sense of narrative purpose.

487
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:54,657
And because you're directing these great narratives,

488
00:26:55,358 --> 00:26:57,599
you also have relatedness, right?

489
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,342
Everybody that I know has a Mass Effect story about, like,

490
00:27:02,483 --> 00:27:05,284
oh, how they felt, you know, they felt this moment of connection.

491
00:27:06,947 --> 00:27:12,409
Mine really was involving Tali and I accidentally killed her and then I had to go back and reload my saved game

492
00:27:12,449 --> 00:27:16,010
and it was very traumatic because I didn't know if I saved in time but it's okay, she's okay, she's okay.

493
00:27:19,791 --> 00:27:22,732
And then there's also some growth and some overcoming of challenge in the game,

494
00:27:22,892 --> 00:27:28,634
but you know, that's not really the tentpole of the Mass Effect experience.

495
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:32,841
So Mass Effect, if Grand Theft Auto gives words,

496
00:27:33,242 --> 00:27:34,383
and if Skyrim gives sentences,

497
00:27:34,723 --> 00:27:36,565
Mass Effect is giving whole paragraphs

498
00:27:36,585 --> 00:27:38,927
for players to kind of assemble and put together, right?

499
00:27:39,248 --> 00:27:41,510
And so you're able to put together a richer story.

500
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:49,725
more quickly that can build a stronger volitional engagement with the game.

501
00:27:50,165 --> 00:27:53,929
And so it's all powerful stuff when it works, right?

502
00:27:53,989 --> 00:27:57,271
When it works and you're telling the story you want to be telling and then you get to

503
00:27:57,311 --> 00:27:59,794
see it jump to life on the screen, it's very powerful.

504
00:28:00,394 --> 00:28:05,278
The problem for you guys as developers is if you take this kind of approach, you have

505
00:28:05,619 --> 00:28:07,340
what we call kind of a mind reading dilemma.

506
00:28:08,581 --> 00:28:10,682
which is that you've got to figure out,

507
00:28:11,123 --> 00:28:12,744
not just like this paragraph,

508
00:28:12,764 --> 00:28:14,245
and paragraph two, and paragraph seven,

509
00:28:14,265 --> 00:28:14,986
but paragraph 48.

510
00:28:16,947 --> 00:28:18,968
And you've got to figure all that stuff out,

511
00:28:19,028 --> 00:28:20,850
and that's really hard to do,

512
00:28:20,930 --> 00:28:24,272
because players are going to have different opinions,

513
00:28:24,312 --> 00:28:26,554
and you can't fully realize every possible outcome.

514
00:28:27,174 --> 00:28:29,776
And so your risk of breaking volition is really high.

515
00:28:30,757 --> 00:28:33,279
A player could be putting together

516
00:28:33,299 --> 00:28:34,379
this really great narrative,

517
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:35,480
and then,

518
00:28:37,442 --> 00:28:37,762
and then,

519
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:38,042
and then,

520
00:28:39,023 --> 00:28:41,524
and then try to get to a point that they want to get to.

521
00:28:41,564 --> 00:28:44,545
And if you don't offer it, it's not just that they have a bad moment,

522
00:28:45,465 --> 00:28:48,105
it's that it really blows apart the whole narrative for them.

523
00:28:49,806 --> 00:28:54,687
Now, it's the same thing that's going on when we look at what happened

524
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:59,068
when Mass Effect had the big ending debacle.

525
00:28:59,888 --> 00:29:04,189
Because if Mass Effect is sort of standing on...

526
00:29:06,337 --> 00:29:10,039
giving people meaningful choice to create their epic story

527
00:29:10,399 --> 00:29:11,739
about how they save the universe,

528
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:15,602
having everything end the same way is not just like,

529
00:29:17,302 --> 00:29:18,963
oh, I'm really mad at you for doing that.

530
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:25,427
It's you, betrayer, hundreds of, I mean, this is deep,

531
00:29:26,447 --> 00:29:29,009
because we're talking about basic psychological needs.

532
00:29:29,709 --> 00:29:31,790
So what you have happening is by the end of the game,

533
00:29:33,573 --> 00:29:38,095
The betrayal happens because they essentially kick out meaningful choice

534
00:29:39,636 --> 00:29:42,757
because the ending is the same and then with meaningful choice without that foundation,

535
00:29:42,777 --> 00:29:46,419
then there is no, you know, narrative purpose. That falls away.

536
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,621
And then if nothing I did really matters, then I didn't really save Tali.

537
00:29:52,542 --> 00:29:56,483
You know, she doesn't love me. I've come to accept it. You know, that falls away.

538
00:29:57,830 --> 00:30:02,433
And then, with all that gone, you no longer have any structure supporting volition.

539
00:30:02,553 --> 00:30:07,476
And worse yet, you've essentially violated this contract with the player,

540
00:30:08,297 --> 00:30:14,401
because you've messed with their basic psychological need for autonomy.

541
00:30:14,481 --> 00:30:18,063
And this is the thing about autonomy. Autonomy is powerful stuff.

542
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:21,526
It's like the fentanyl of... I don't know if that's the best example, but...

543
00:30:22,764 --> 00:30:25,506
You know, it's stuff that, it's super powerful,

544
00:30:25,526 --> 00:30:28,128
but it can, you know, you've got to handle it

545
00:30:28,148 --> 00:30:28,829
really carefully.

546
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,392
So, bottom line is, you don't want to mess with autonomy.

547
00:30:33,693 --> 00:30:36,315
All right, let's talk about one more,

548
00:30:36,956 --> 00:30:40,319
and then I want to turn a little bit and talk about,

549
00:30:41,700 --> 00:30:42,921
based on everything that we've said,

550
00:30:42,981 --> 00:30:44,482
about some of these dynamics and systems,

551
00:30:44,582 --> 00:30:45,703
what could come next.

552
00:30:47,243 --> 00:30:50,846
So, the last one I want to talk about is Witcher, which we kind of see as a hybrid.

553
00:30:50,906 --> 00:30:55,190
It's sort of cool when Witcher came out and we had the chance to play that game and look

554
00:30:55,210 --> 00:31:01,195
at that game, because Witcher really takes inspiration from Mass Effect and Skyrim structures.

555
00:31:02,512 --> 00:31:07,175
So you see a rich main narrative that's like Mass Effect,

556
00:31:07,255 --> 00:31:08,196
it's fully realized,

557
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:11,799
and there's a beautiful deep story there.

558
00:31:12,379 --> 00:31:16,002
But you also see an incredibly deep system

559
00:31:16,282 --> 00:31:20,525
of quests and stories and activities that can be undertaken.

560
00:31:22,700 --> 00:31:24,141
in the way that Skyrim provides them.

561
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:28,104
And in some ways, that provides nice coverage,

562
00:31:28,544 --> 00:31:30,085
and that provides nice, dense coverage

563
00:31:31,025 --> 00:31:33,146
for need satisfaction, whether you're engaged

564
00:31:33,226 --> 00:31:35,888
in the big epic story, or you just wanna have

565
00:31:36,308 --> 00:31:38,450
a meaningful couple hours of play to help yourself progress.

566
00:31:39,967 --> 00:31:44,129
Lots of deep volition building, again, meaningful choice over narrative.

567
00:31:45,109 --> 00:31:47,970
You've got a lot of the same kind of relational dynamics.

568
00:31:49,091 --> 00:31:51,052
And you've got a little bit of growth.

569
00:31:51,432 --> 00:31:54,374
Growth is not kind of the, you know, there are RPG systems in there,

570
00:31:54,394 --> 00:31:56,034
not as dense or as rich as Skyrim's.

571
00:31:57,355 --> 00:32:00,857
But you are conquering challenges and you're really kind of hitting on all these cylinders.

572
00:32:00,877 --> 00:32:02,698
So there's very strong volitional engagement.

573
00:32:03,038 --> 00:32:04,138
One thing that Wisher did very...

574
00:32:06,417 --> 00:32:09,359
It was very interesting to me was they traded in fidelity

575
00:32:10,159 --> 00:32:13,381
in order to better deliver on the promise of impactful choices.

576
00:32:14,501 --> 00:32:19,524
So, they couldn't fully render all the endings they want to render.

577
00:32:19,544 --> 00:32:22,485
So, they're like, well, let's not render them. Let's just tell them comic book style.

578
00:32:23,225 --> 00:32:25,907
And let's make the bet that the player just wants to see the story.

579
00:32:26,487 --> 00:32:30,629
They want to finish the story and they want to see the story that they were writing.

580
00:32:31,430 --> 00:32:32,730
And I think that was the right choice.

581
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,448
Would it be great if they could have fully rendered everything?

582
00:32:37,309 --> 00:32:38,230
Sure, that would have been great.

583
00:32:38,751 --> 00:32:41,594
But the choice here to focus on a dynamic that

584
00:32:43,375 --> 00:32:46,779
is going towards need satisfaction

585
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:49,101
versus just going towards fidelity, I think,

586
00:32:49,562 --> 00:32:50,743
is always the right decision.

587
00:32:52,585 --> 00:32:54,067
Also, even in their side quests.

588
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:59,824
Their side quests were not just take these 10 flowers to Bob in the town over.

589
00:33:00,084 --> 00:33:04,091
Their side quests were pretty fully realized three-act structures.

590
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:06,875
You know, Geralt gets...

591
00:33:08,169 --> 00:33:10,330
a mystery handed to him that he must solve.

592
00:33:10,610 --> 00:33:13,591
Then he goes and figures it's put in front of him

593
00:33:13,611 --> 00:33:16,032
and he has to make a decision, and then he sees an impact.

594
00:33:16,472 --> 00:33:18,113
And so there's this sort of full narrative

595
00:33:18,153 --> 00:33:22,695
that lets people, again, have their paragraphs handed to them

596
00:33:22,755 --> 00:33:23,535
about what they're doing.

597
00:33:24,035 --> 00:33:27,196
But if they misstep, these things

598
00:33:27,236 --> 00:33:28,817
are decoupled from the main narrative.

599
00:33:28,877 --> 00:33:31,158
So it doesn't break their volitional engagement

600
00:33:31,178 --> 00:33:31,938
in the game itself.

601
00:33:33,181 --> 00:33:38,544
So having kind of these nested deep stories,

602
00:33:39,565 --> 00:33:41,886
deep side stories within the larger main narrative

603
00:33:41,926 --> 00:33:42,386
worked well.

604
00:33:43,767 --> 00:33:45,668
So one of the reasons that I talk about

605
00:33:47,312 --> 00:33:53,295
multiple games and multiple strategies is to point out that there is no one right way

606
00:33:53,335 --> 00:33:53,755
to do this.

607
00:33:53,795 --> 00:33:57,578
We can certainly look at it and as researchers we do, we look at, well, this seems to have

608
00:33:57,618 --> 00:34:00,960
a lot of value and this has some value and this has more value.

609
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:06,123
But there's lots of different ways that you can tackle these issues, all of which are

610
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:10,945
focused on need satisfaction in the service of building volition and people leaning forward

611
00:34:10,965 --> 00:34:11,746
into the experience.

612
00:34:12,326 --> 00:34:14,768
But there are lots of ways to satisfy those needs, right?

613
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:20,922
I did want to point out though that in all the things I just talked about, all the reasons

614
00:34:20,962 --> 00:34:23,222
that these games are winning really aren't about freedom.

615
00:34:23,723 --> 00:34:28,144
They're about that meaningful choice, growth, mastery, and that basic needs satisfaction.

616
00:34:29,524 --> 00:34:38,207
So let's now turn to the challenge here, which is only a handful of companies on the planet

617
00:34:39,064 --> 00:34:40,865
can really make these games, right?

618
00:34:40,925 --> 00:34:42,326
That can make Volition at scale.

619
00:34:42,386 --> 00:34:43,626
And even for them, it's hard.

620
00:34:44,467 --> 00:34:47,228
What's the timeline between these games being released?

621
00:34:47,268 --> 00:34:48,769
I mean, this is epic.

622
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:53,251
So, that creates an opportunity.

623
00:34:53,311 --> 00:34:56,173
Like, if we can find ways to deliver dense Volition

624
00:34:56,933 --> 00:34:59,915
at scale, then open world is gonna become

625
00:34:59,935 --> 00:35:04,017
a much richer space for both developers and players.

626
00:35:04,077 --> 00:35:06,738
So, our little scientist guy, which is really you guys,

627
00:35:07,298 --> 00:35:08,419
like, okay, how could we do that?

628
00:35:10,102 --> 00:35:14,164
And there are lots of different directions I could go in now about things out there

629
00:35:14,204 --> 00:35:16,526
and the ways people are trying to think about that,

630
00:35:16,566 --> 00:35:19,187
but I just want to do this one because it's so...

631
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,888
It's the main one, I think, and it's really salient,

632
00:35:22,388 --> 00:35:26,370
which is procedural systems, the magic of procedural generation.

633
00:35:26,390 --> 00:35:30,372
Right? Ah, we can press a button and our game springs to life.

634
00:35:31,913 --> 00:35:35,195
So I say the agony and the ecstasy because

635
00:35:36,135 --> 00:35:38,196
there's no doubt that people want that to be true.

636
00:35:40,150 --> 00:35:42,891
We want that to be true. We just want that game.

637
00:35:44,711 --> 00:35:46,172
And that's because of our need for autonomy.

638
00:35:47,592 --> 00:35:51,452
And there's a couple narratives here. I'll just pick the most

639
00:35:51,512 --> 00:35:55,313
recent one, which is No Man's Sky. And I don't want to pile on and

640
00:35:55,333 --> 00:35:59,254
complain about No Man's Sky. I actually played the hell out of

641
00:35:59,294 --> 00:36:03,395
No Man's Sky. I think No Man's Sky is a really important game and there's tons I love about No Man's Sky.

642
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,095
But, you know, No Man's Sky had some issues.

643
00:36:08,147 --> 00:36:09,828
and it had a lot of issues with players.

644
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:13,008
And it has to do with all the experiential things we're talking about,

645
00:36:13,488 --> 00:36:16,929
and it has to do with the fact that they fell into the freedom fallacy trap.

646
00:36:18,830 --> 00:36:22,151
If you want to see more evidence that autonomy is the single biggest thing

647
00:36:22,171 --> 00:36:24,051
that your players are thinking about, think about the fact that

648
00:36:24,351 --> 00:36:27,492
when the game got delayed, Sean Murray got death threats

649
00:36:27,632 --> 00:36:28,632
just because it got delayed.

650
00:36:29,692 --> 00:36:31,573
This also happened, I think, I don't remember,

651
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:34,093
but I think during some of the Mass Effect stuff,

652
00:36:34,133 --> 00:36:36,414
there was also a story about some death threats for Bill.

653
00:36:38,016 --> 00:36:40,598
like death threats about a game.

654
00:36:40,658 --> 00:36:43,520
And I was thinking, wow, the only two games I know that are big space games.

655
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:46,263
I wonder if there's something about the promise of autonomy there

656
00:36:46,283 --> 00:36:47,984
that's really pissing people off, right?

657
00:36:48,624 --> 00:36:51,527
Then when the game launched, of course, we have all the stuff

658
00:36:51,547 --> 00:36:54,269
that people have heard about, which is the nasty backlash against it.

659
00:36:54,309 --> 00:36:55,310
Because why?

660
00:36:56,070 --> 00:36:57,351
Why was there a nasty backlash?

661
00:36:57,872 --> 00:37:00,073
Because there's nothing to do.

662
00:37:00,133 --> 00:37:00,634
What am I doing?

663
00:37:00,674 --> 00:37:01,695
There wasn't any.

664
00:37:03,396 --> 00:37:07,199
dense volitional content in there for people to consume and be satisfied by.

665
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:10,482
People burned through the very thin layer that was there

666
00:37:11,243 --> 00:37:15,206
on the first two planets and they were out, if that.

667
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,510
And then there came the existential navel gazing about

668
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,061
Maybe it was all of our mistake.

669
00:37:22,081 --> 00:37:24,701
Like I saw multiple articles, I thought it was really funny.

670
00:37:24,741 --> 00:37:28,422
And really, they were fundamentally making a point about autonomy.

671
00:37:28,442 --> 00:37:30,843
It's like, why is it that we expect so much?

672
00:37:31,063 --> 00:37:34,124
Is it that we, you know, fill in the story here?

673
00:37:36,124 --> 00:37:41,106
And I find all this fascinating because it really makes perfect sense to me

674
00:37:41,146 --> 00:37:43,846
because of how we're all fanboys of autonomy.

675
00:37:43,886 --> 00:37:44,627
That's what we want.

676
00:37:46,047 --> 00:37:46,127
And...

677
00:37:47,254 --> 00:37:53,601
So we need this space game. Space is a perfect example for it. It doesn't mean that it has to be a space game.

678
00:37:53,681 --> 00:37:59,187
We need a game that fulfills the promise that we think about when we think about No Man's Sky.

679
00:37:59,727 --> 00:38:03,451
But of course we've all been through this before. We went through this 10 years ago with Spore.

680
00:38:05,537 --> 00:38:09,280
And again, sport did some amazing things, but sport was a disappointment.

681
00:38:09,361 --> 00:38:11,763
And it was a disappointment because of autonomy.

682
00:38:11,883 --> 00:38:16,166
Everybody wanted to get to the space stage and spend the rest of their lives exploring

683
00:38:16,247 --> 00:38:17,728
all this awesome content.

684
00:38:17,768 --> 00:38:23,373
And that didn't happen because there wasn't a focus on volitional engagement.

685
00:38:24,053 --> 00:38:26,996
And of course, there are people in the wings waiting to come in.

686
00:38:28,337 --> 00:38:30,159
So there are some other people on deck.

687
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:36,966
to either make us all super, super happy or need to go into hiding. I don't know.

688
00:38:38,707 --> 00:38:44,268
But I'm rooting for it. I'm rooting for this genre. I think I understand why players want

689
00:38:44,308 --> 00:38:49,970
it. Players project this, to come back to the point I was making earlier, they project

690
00:38:50,010 --> 00:38:55,011
this deep autonomy satisfaction within this universe. But it's because...

691
00:38:56,492 --> 00:38:57,993
they don't know what the game is yet.

692
00:38:58,573 --> 00:39:01,854
So all they have to go on, the only information they have to go on,

693
00:39:02,234 --> 00:39:03,815
is when you tell them about size.

694
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:07,576
And they project autonomy into size, and don't fall into that trap.

695
00:39:08,476 --> 00:39:10,797
Because they don't really want size, they want size,

696
00:39:10,817 --> 00:39:12,138
but they want volitional engagement.

697
00:39:16,041 --> 00:39:20,024
And so, we figured out how to make all these planets with procedural content.

698
00:39:20,044 --> 00:39:25,309
I just want to say that if we're going to solve this issue, whether it's in space or some other type of game,

699
00:39:25,569 --> 00:39:34,096
we're not going to solve it by procedurally generating content and then backfilling it with handcrafted material and activities.

700
00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:38,679
It would be like trying to fill up the ocean with a shovel. It's not going to happen.

701
00:39:39,240 --> 00:39:41,362
So I want to propose that...

702
00:39:42,268 --> 00:39:45,395
You guys all go out and maybe tackle, if you're not already,

703
00:39:46,056 --> 00:39:50,466
you tackle a challenge, which is the idea of building procedural volition.

704
00:39:54,128 --> 00:39:58,429
What I mean specifically here is that you create systems to automatically generate content

705
00:39:58,469 --> 00:40:03,010
whose focus is the player experience of those basic needs satisfactions.

706
00:40:03,410 --> 00:40:08,651
And that may sound like a moonshot of an idea, but if you think about it, look, we already

707
00:40:08,751 --> 00:40:14,012
know, we've distilled down what the essence is of that all-important autonomy satisfaction,

708
00:40:14,032 --> 00:40:14,753
which is volition.

709
00:40:15,053 --> 00:40:19,734
We know what the granular experiences of needs satisfaction are that accrue to that, and

710
00:40:19,754 --> 00:40:21,114
we can look at current games.

711
00:40:22,655 --> 00:40:28,557
and we can see the types of things that they're doing in order to satisfy volition.

712
00:40:28,597 --> 00:40:31,019
So we have a lot of interesting pieces on the board, right?

713
00:40:31,299 --> 00:40:35,801
So now what we have to do is we just have to figure out how do we get that to scale, right?

714
00:40:36,581 --> 00:40:38,622
So, you know, shouldn't be that hard.

715
00:40:39,943 --> 00:40:44,104
Obviously super complicated because now we have to deal with psychology in the mix

716
00:40:45,725 --> 00:40:48,806
and we have a whole other set of variables, but, you know, I think that...

717
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:50,722
I think I would love that game.

718
00:40:50,762 --> 00:40:52,304
I bet most people in here would love those games.

719
00:40:52,444 --> 00:40:55,247
I think it would be transformative to the creation of games.

720
00:40:55,287 --> 00:40:58,511
And I know that players want it, because players already feel like they've been promised it

721
00:40:58,571 --> 00:41:00,974
like 40 times.

722
00:41:00,994 --> 00:41:05,019
So they're a little bit on edge and suspicious at the same time.

723
00:41:07,245 --> 00:41:11,008
There are some glimpses I see out there, I'm just going to touch on one of them of some

724
00:41:11,048 --> 00:41:17,073
cool ideas that don't really qualify procedural generation, but do some interesting magic

725
00:41:17,153 --> 00:41:23,358
tricks that show you can generate a lot of the experience of depth and volition, even

726
00:41:23,398 --> 00:41:27,022
with very limited resources by being smart about what you're doing.

727
00:41:27,482 --> 00:41:29,123
So Shadow of Mordor.

728
00:41:30,525 --> 00:41:39,133
has the nemesis system, and it has sparks of this kind of idea of being really efficient to generate an expectation and deep experiences,

729
00:41:39,493 --> 00:41:49,322
where, you know, it procedurally generated, you know, a nemesis for the player, and it did that by, you know, when you have interactions with this Orc,

730
00:41:49,403 --> 00:41:52,345
this, you know, they have massive impact, not just on...

731
00:41:53,380 --> 00:41:58,042
You know, the orc itself, if you shoot an arrow through its eye or whatever you do to it,

732
00:41:58,122 --> 00:41:59,862
its eye is blocked off.

733
00:41:59,882 --> 00:42:02,023
But also, that orc is pissed.

734
00:42:02,243 --> 00:42:06,964
Or if that orc kills you, by the way, whether you win or lose, things happen, right?

735
00:42:07,164 --> 00:42:09,785
The orc kills you, suddenly the orc becomes more powerful.

736
00:42:10,125 --> 00:42:12,786
Now you're knitted together in this relationship.

737
00:42:13,046 --> 00:42:16,807
And also, you've learned a schema for the game that isn't exactly accurate.

738
00:42:16,827 --> 00:42:18,468
And the schema is, wow.

739
00:42:19,476 --> 00:42:21,918
These orcs, they really take everything personally.

740
00:42:21,938 --> 00:42:24,701
It's like they're all out there, who knows what could happen.

741
00:42:25,301 --> 00:42:29,665
Now, you know, players can pattern fit very quickly that there wasn't that much depth.

742
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:37,102
But just the amount of depth that was there allowed for a really compelling personal narrative

743
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:39,243
where people felt like, this is my story.

744
00:42:39,524 --> 00:42:43,826
That was my one-eyed orc that I shot the arrow through, right?

745
00:42:44,266 --> 00:42:49,748
And so you see all of these stories on the internet of...

746
00:42:51,358 --> 00:42:55,143
uh... players who have these interactions and then you know they get

747
00:42:55,223 --> 00:42:58,628
online and they start talking about oh yeah I gotta kill this guy you know this is just

748
00:42:59,409 --> 00:43:00,610
I'm not going to read all this but

749
00:43:00,630 --> 00:43:04,135
uh... there's many many examples of it just to call one thing out

750
00:43:05,946 --> 00:43:08,608
The nemesis system let me craft my own story and relationships.

751
00:43:08,708 --> 00:43:11,210
In the end, the fighting was the end of the game for me.

752
00:43:11,290 --> 00:43:13,512
Me and my bitter rival and nemesis were friends.

753
00:43:13,572 --> 00:43:15,673
So if I were to put up, I don't have it here,

754
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:19,376
but the need satisfaction chart for Mordor,

755
00:43:19,937 --> 00:43:21,898
you know, there's this amazing thing,

756
00:43:21,938 --> 00:43:24,560
which is that this procedural system,

757
00:43:24,580 --> 00:43:26,722
but this system that laid on top,

758
00:43:26,782 --> 00:43:31,486
this nemesis system created this deep relationship

759
00:43:31,506 --> 00:43:34,128
satisfaction, relatedness satisfaction with an enemy.

760
00:43:35,252 --> 00:43:36,354
which is really fascinating.

761
00:43:36,955 --> 00:43:39,320
So there's really innovative things we can do

762
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:42,145
to take a little and turn it into a lot experientially.

763
00:43:44,038 --> 00:43:49,742
I just want to close by talking about a couple of things that I think might be worth considering.

764
00:43:49,782 --> 00:43:55,586
And I'm saying this fully aware that I'm neither a video game designer nor am I an engineer.

765
00:43:56,126 --> 00:43:59,228
So feel free to chuckle or whatever you want to do.

766
00:43:59,368 --> 00:44:01,790
But I am somebody that works with data and numbers a lot.

767
00:44:02,250 --> 00:44:05,273
And I am somebody that works with formula and also trying to...

768
00:44:07,115 --> 00:44:12,845
Take people and, this is going to sound awful, but take people and turn what they're experiencing

769
00:44:12,885 --> 00:44:14,087
into things that can be measured.

770
00:44:14,827 --> 00:44:16,028
and that we can put a number to,

771
00:44:16,728 --> 00:44:18,750
and that that number is meaningful for something.

772
00:44:19,170 --> 00:44:21,091
And I just want to say that that's the piece

773
00:44:21,171 --> 00:44:25,295
that behavioral psychologists carry around a lot,

774
00:44:25,415 --> 00:44:27,897
which is you can measure things like love

775
00:44:27,977 --> 00:44:29,358
and all these big ideas.

776
00:44:30,859 --> 00:44:32,940
You can actually find ways to operationalize

777
00:44:33,001 --> 00:44:34,442
and measure them, and since that's true,

778
00:44:35,222 --> 00:44:36,703
I think what we need to do is we need to put

779
00:44:36,783 --> 00:44:39,105
more player verbs, player variables,

780
00:44:39,806 --> 00:44:43,549
into our equations for procedural generation.

781
00:44:44,464 --> 00:44:49,585
So instead of just procedurally generating content and then trying to manually wrap systems over the content,

782
00:44:50,046 --> 00:44:55,927
why can't we be creating systems where, as players make choices and they act,

783
00:44:56,587 --> 00:44:59,468
that the game world is procedurally altered and it scales?

784
00:44:59,528 --> 00:45:05,190
Not just a decision point that puts you down a bunch of pre-rendered content A, pre-rendered content B,

785
00:45:06,710 --> 00:45:07,870
but it's procedurally generated.

786
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:10,831
The second thing is to focus on meaningful impact.

787
00:45:10,931 --> 00:45:11,811
Impact is key.

788
00:45:12,809 --> 00:45:14,771
And we've seen that in all the things that we've talked about.

789
00:45:15,571 --> 00:45:19,414
So we could focus on dynamically changing content,

790
00:45:21,696 --> 00:45:23,898
goal structures, activity structures,

791
00:45:24,639 --> 00:45:27,061
in response to what the players are doing,

792
00:45:28,402 --> 00:45:29,363
and do that procedurally.

793
00:45:29,603 --> 00:45:30,864
You're like, what the hell does that mean?

794
00:45:32,111 --> 00:45:33,233
What does that look like? I don't know.

795
00:45:33,814 --> 00:45:36,598
Right? That's, you know, we're here to innovate and design.

796
00:45:36,638 --> 00:45:39,462
So these are just some thoughts I had about this.

797
00:45:40,103 --> 00:45:42,667
And the last thing I want to mention is this idea of latent variables.

798
00:45:42,728 --> 00:45:44,871
And for the non-math people, latent variables are just...

799
00:45:46,237 --> 00:45:48,619
variables that get computed from other variables.

800
00:45:48,639 --> 00:45:51,881
So you're tracking all this telemetry and the things that people are doing in the game.

801
00:45:51,921 --> 00:45:54,643
One of the great things that is now happening in behavioral science

802
00:45:55,223 --> 00:46:00,848
is that you can compute weighting variables and latent variable profiles for people

803
00:46:01,228 --> 00:46:05,631
that essentially let people be their own baseline for various things.

804
00:46:06,872 --> 00:46:10,294
and you essentially are getting pictures of who that person is.

805
00:46:10,514 --> 00:46:13,155
I think these variables could be used as weighting variables

806
00:46:13,856 --> 00:46:18,438
in the procedural generation equation so that you could surface for players

807
00:46:19,539 --> 00:46:20,899
in a much more powerful way

808
00:46:21,720 --> 00:46:24,581
the types of experiences and content

809
00:46:25,082 --> 00:46:26,602
that are actually aligned with

810
00:46:27,563 --> 00:46:29,104
what it is that they have an affinity for.

811
00:46:30,197 --> 00:46:33,939
And we could do that much more than we are simply by tracking behavioral telemetry the

812
00:46:33,999 --> 00:46:34,920
way that we are now.

813
00:46:35,761 --> 00:46:43,426
So anyway, we could talk about ideas for this all day, but I really think that if we're

814
00:46:43,446 --> 00:46:47,169
going to actually create the game that we all hoped No Man's Sky would be or Spore

815
00:46:47,189 --> 00:46:52,313
was or maybe what all the next things are, I think that we're not going to crack that

816
00:46:52,373 --> 00:46:57,016
unless we can begin to think about engineering deep.

817
00:46:58,040 --> 00:47:01,383
volitional player experiences through need satisfaction.

818
00:47:01,763 --> 00:47:03,405
I think that, why not?

819
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:05,786
I think it could be done.

820
00:47:05,806 --> 00:47:08,488
I think it's going to be hard, but everything worthwhile

821
00:47:08,508 --> 00:47:09,009
is hard, right?

822
00:47:09,529 --> 00:47:10,570
So I think that's it.

823
00:47:10,610 --> 00:47:12,532
Just remember whatever comes next.

824
00:47:13,572 --> 00:47:15,214
Autonomy equals volition, not freedom.

825
00:47:16,274 --> 00:47:16,475
Thanks.

826
00:47:25,970 --> 00:47:27,251
All right, so if people have questions,

827
00:47:27,271 --> 00:47:28,612
they can come down to the mics.

828
00:47:29,353 --> 00:47:29,973
All right, yeah.

829
00:47:30,534 --> 00:47:31,234
Hey, how's it going?

830
00:47:31,274 --> 00:47:31,675
Thank you.

831
00:47:33,036 --> 00:47:34,377
I was wondering if you had spent much time

832
00:47:34,437 --> 00:47:37,640
thinking about, with regards to belongingness

833
00:47:37,800 --> 00:47:41,143
and relatedness, the role that other players can play,

834
00:47:42,644 --> 00:47:46,668
and of course, how one would measure that effect

835
00:47:47,208 --> 00:47:49,110
once you realize that there are other players

836
00:47:49,150 --> 00:47:50,771
that are creating this sense of belongingness.

837
00:47:52,344 --> 00:47:55,085
So, one thing I didn't talk about at all today,

838
00:47:55,165 --> 00:47:58,626
which was just very deliberate, is other players.

839
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:03,247
Other players is a massive interpersonal variable

840
00:48:03,287 --> 00:48:04,927
and mechanism for need satisfaction.

841
00:48:06,428 --> 00:48:07,788
It's, you know, when you look at

842
00:48:07,868 --> 00:48:09,128
competitive multiplayer games,

843
00:48:09,368 --> 00:48:11,849
the reason that competitive multiplayer games are so big,

844
00:48:11,889 --> 00:48:12,669
and I didn't talk about them,

845
00:48:12,689 --> 00:48:13,710
but I referenced them in the beginning,

846
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:15,630
you know, a lot of this has to do with

847
00:48:16,030 --> 00:48:18,611
that kind of relatedness satisfaction that's going on.

848
00:48:18,631 --> 00:48:20,851
So, I think that...

849
00:48:22,394 --> 00:48:25,215
When I think about relatedness in this context,

850
00:48:25,455 --> 00:48:27,916
I just go back and just like any other system,

851
00:48:27,956 --> 00:48:32,638
I would say, what are the experiences or social systems

852
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:34,718
that you want to set up in the game

853
00:48:34,758 --> 00:48:36,859
for multiplayer interactions?

854
00:48:37,479 --> 00:48:42,461
And how do those systems facilitate belongingness,

855
00:48:42,541 --> 00:48:45,822
facilitate I matter to you and you matter to me?

856
00:48:46,062 --> 00:48:49,023
You know, the classic example from, you know,

857
00:48:49,784 --> 00:48:53,626
World of Warcraft or the tank healer structure is that it was a mechanic that fostered

858
00:48:54,347 --> 00:48:56,608
people feeling like they mattered to one another, because they did.

859
00:48:57,549 --> 00:49:01,691
So, you know, that's why that takes hold on a relatedness level. So the question

860
00:49:01,751 --> 00:49:04,753
is how can those systems be built? But I think it's massively important.

861
00:49:05,474 --> 00:49:07,555
And if we were doing a talk on relatedness...

862
00:49:09,576 --> 00:49:13,038
I would have gone into all those things, but what I will say, and I'm glad you asked the question, is that

863
00:49:13,678 --> 00:49:19,581
relatedness, and you saw it in the marriage and having a baby example, is a massive driver of volitional engagement.

864
00:49:20,121 --> 00:49:22,262
So, does that get at your question?

865
00:49:23,283 --> 00:49:24,963
Yeah, I think so. We can talk more about that.

866
00:49:24,983 --> 00:49:28,765
Okay, that's great. All right, who was next? Walker, can you wait? Okay.

867
00:49:30,386 --> 00:49:31,586
Sorry, Walker. Yeah.

868
00:49:32,299 --> 00:49:37,124
Hello. I'd like to talk a little bit about procedural evolution.

869
00:49:37,144 --> 00:49:43,811
There is a genre that actually does something that you mentioned,

870
00:49:43,831 --> 00:49:47,835
that forex strategies like civilization or Stellaris,

871
00:49:48,655 --> 00:49:50,017
talking about space by the way.

872
00:49:50,037 --> 00:49:52,299
Yes, yeah, yeah.

873
00:49:52,399 --> 00:49:54,301
How do you think, can we...

874
00:49:56,900 --> 00:50:01,322
distill somehow the principles like for

875
00:50:01,602 --> 00:50:06,104
That are work in these 4x games and apply it to open world

876
00:50:08,024 --> 00:50:11,606
Yeah, I so I think sure I think that's as good idea as any I mean

877
00:50:11,626 --> 00:50:19,810
I I think that those games have a lot of very deeply nested systems that all operate and they create a they create a dynamic

878
00:50:21,430 --> 00:50:24,191
Arc to a game that can last you know, I don't know 20 or 30 hours

879
00:50:26,673 --> 00:50:30,435
I think what we're talking about here, though, is taking things to a much greater scale.

880
00:50:31,576 --> 00:50:34,138
In other words, when you play those games, you do get a narrative arc,

881
00:50:34,238 --> 00:50:37,840
but you tend to play the same story over and over again.

882
00:50:37,860 --> 00:50:44,145
This is the story of you conquering the world, or the story of you conquering the universe, and then you just kind of go back again.

883
00:50:45,826 --> 00:50:47,847
It doesn't create this kind of persistent

884
00:50:49,889 --> 00:50:55,292
persistent universe that I think is a different thing than things like those strategy games are.

885
00:50:55,672 --> 00:51:01,236
But to your point, I think that some of the ideas in there about how they're combining dynamic systems

886
00:51:01,716 --> 00:51:08,200
in order to create an ever-changing landscape moment to moment that lets the player in one game say,

887
00:51:09,261 --> 00:51:15,925
I'm pissed off at Gandhi for nuking me, and in another game being mad at Montezuma.

888
00:51:16,925 --> 00:51:18,486
I think there's something worth mining there, sure.

889
00:51:21,735 --> 00:51:30,177
So it might just be a terminology, but in your graphic about autonomy, competence and

890
00:51:30,197 --> 00:51:37,779
relatedness holding up volition, like volition you have also pointed out is the same as autonomy,

891
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,280
so what the hell?

892
00:51:40,060 --> 00:51:40,620
Right the hell, right.

893
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,681
So you're asking a really nuanced semantic question.

894
00:51:43,721 --> 00:51:45,941
So autonomy is...

895
00:51:48,382 --> 00:51:50,562
Autonomy is the feeling of agency.

896
00:51:50,863 --> 00:51:53,604
It's the feeling of that I am creating my story, right?

897
00:51:54,524 --> 00:51:55,884
That's really what autonomy is.

898
00:51:56,625 --> 00:51:59,406
Volition is if you want to be doing something,

899
00:51:59,466 --> 00:52:02,587
then that aligns with that sense of agency, right?

900
00:52:03,307 --> 00:52:07,468
And so when I put the autonomy as a support,

901
00:52:08,997 --> 00:52:12,920
There are other things that also create that sense of wanting and other things.

902
00:52:12,940 --> 00:52:16,402
There's the creation of meaningful choices and those sorts of things.

903
00:52:16,422 --> 00:52:21,046
The other thing I would say is that if you want to get really deep into self-determination theory,

904
00:52:21,566 --> 00:52:28,271
it's often the case that you talk about autonomous functioning as a roll-up of all the need-satisfiers.

905
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:34,974
Because that's, if you had to pick one overarching principle of self-determination theory,

906
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:40,015
it's that you're behaving in a way that feels like you fully endorse the path that you're on,

907
00:52:40,055 --> 00:52:41,716
and these things all become inputs to that.

908
00:52:42,256 --> 00:52:42,996
Okay.

909
00:52:44,317 --> 00:52:49,119
Hi, I was one of the designers on Spore, and we had, like after the game shipped,

910
00:52:49,159 --> 00:52:52,300
a lot of hardcore game players really hated it, and they were down on it, like you mentioned.

911
00:52:53,287 --> 00:52:56,129
But we also found that a lot of younger players just loved it,

912
00:52:56,289 --> 00:52:58,230
like to the point of people like, where's Spore 2?

913
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:00,370
Like, I love that game, I played it all the time.

914
00:53:00,891 --> 00:53:04,632
And I was wondering if you did much research about age and how it relates to autonomy,

915
00:53:04,692 --> 00:53:10,755
like why would kids be more autonomous or willing to play in these systems than adults might be?

916
00:53:12,507 --> 00:53:15,289
So there's a lot of possible answers to that.

917
00:53:15,469 --> 00:53:17,751
One thing is there's context in Spore.

918
00:53:17,951 --> 00:53:21,274
And so the Creature Editor was one of the most

919
00:53:21,354 --> 00:53:22,975
amazing things that Games has produced.

920
00:53:24,116 --> 00:53:28,238
And it had a context that kids could really relate to.

921
00:53:28,419 --> 00:53:30,440
I mean, it looked like taking a giant,

922
00:53:30,700 --> 00:53:33,702
the Play-Doh machine, and putting something together

923
00:53:33,742 --> 00:53:35,424
in infinite ways and bringing something to life.

924
00:53:36,184 --> 00:53:38,286
And they can map that schema really easily.

925
00:53:38,306 --> 00:53:40,587
So there's some of that sort of schema mapping

926
00:53:40,647 --> 00:53:41,508
and affinity for.

927
00:53:42,749 --> 00:53:49,736
that that's going on. I think that also it's a it was a context that smaller game of doing that creating creatures

928
00:53:49,756 --> 00:53:53,219
like what I'd be interested. I guess my question is did kids want to go to space?

929
00:53:54,138 --> 00:53:55,239
Or do kids want to play around?

930
00:53:55,259 --> 00:53:56,780
Like, did you ever look at the telemetry

931
00:53:56,801 --> 00:53:57,641
and the behavioral data?

932
00:53:57,661 --> 00:53:58,923
Because that would give you some clues.

933
00:53:59,823 --> 00:54:02,386
Yeah, not directly, although we did have a lot of, like,

934
00:54:02,426 --> 00:54:04,888
parents telling us that their kids couldn't play spore anymore.

935
00:54:05,109 --> 00:54:06,150
Like, they had to take it away from them

936
00:54:06,170 --> 00:54:07,231
because they played it too much.

937
00:54:07,791 --> 00:54:10,254
Yeah. And we've seen, like, drawings from kids

938
00:54:10,294 --> 00:54:12,736
that show the whole arc from cell all the way up to space.

939
00:54:13,657 --> 00:54:14,677
They would draw by hand.

940
00:54:15,157 --> 00:54:15,317
Yeah.

941
00:54:15,337 --> 00:54:16,077
They weren't playing the game.

942
00:54:16,277 --> 00:54:21,039
I mean my bet is, we don't know because we don't have data, that they're kind of playing

943
00:54:21,059 --> 00:54:21,899
at that level.

944
00:54:22,379 --> 00:54:26,781
I mean I bet if you just looked at how many kids play the Creature Creator, mothers might

945
00:54:27,101 --> 00:54:30,262
complain about that same thing because it was such a compelling piece.

946
00:54:30,282 --> 00:54:30,862
Yeah.

947
00:54:30,882 --> 00:54:35,023
I think the more general question I have is just the age and autonomy, like independent

948
00:54:35,043 --> 00:54:35,363
of spore.

949
00:54:35,383 --> 00:54:35,563
Right.

950
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:41,105
So, the thing about the needs are that they are, you know, one of the quick examples I

951
00:54:41,165 --> 00:54:45,066
use is that it's the same as you've got, I'm talking about psychological needs, you also

952
00:54:45,126 --> 00:54:46,066
have physical needs.

953
00:54:47,366 --> 00:54:52,528
And so you have a physical need for hunger and thirst, and think about them in the same

954
00:54:52,588 --> 00:54:53,088
way as that.

955
00:54:53,408 --> 00:54:59,589
So, you know, kids have them, adults have them, old people have them, young people have

956
00:54:59,609 --> 00:54:59,689
them.

957
00:54:59,709 --> 00:55:03,810
It's like, you know, kids don't have less hunger than adults do or less of a need for

958
00:55:03,871 --> 00:55:04,711
food than adults do.

959
00:55:05,897 --> 00:55:10,097
these are universal things at every age and across, you know, really globally.

960
00:55:10,157 --> 00:55:13,358
And when I say that, we've measured kids, we've measured across the world.

961
00:55:13,378 --> 00:55:17,759
There have been thousands of studies in a lot of domains outside of games that validate the needs.

962
00:55:18,859 --> 00:55:22,820
The question is just how, what are the channels by which those needs get satisfied?

963
00:55:22,840 --> 00:55:25,720
And so the one thing I will say is that for adults,

964
00:55:26,160 --> 00:55:31,401
there are certain things where we have autonomy that they don't feel

965
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:36,521
We don't feel like we're flexing a lot of muscles for growth and experimentation, like

966
00:55:36,601 --> 00:55:38,642
picking out our own clothes, for example.

967
00:55:39,282 --> 00:55:41,603
That's not something that's very need satisfying.

968
00:55:41,643 --> 00:55:42,884
We've kind of got that down.

969
00:55:43,044 --> 00:55:45,024
We've pattern fit the whole picking out our clothes thing.

970
00:55:45,945 --> 00:55:49,166
But for kids, you'll see in games that they'll have affinity to, I want to wear the goofy

971
00:55:49,186 --> 00:55:52,368
hat and I want to do this thing and I want to experiment, because they don't have disposable

972
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:53,588
income to go buy clothes.

973
00:55:54,609 --> 00:56:00,154
The needs are the same, but the channels by which they get satisfied can differ as a function

974
00:56:00,174 --> 00:56:03,037
of age, preference, taste, those sorts of things.

975
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:12,443
A lot of what you talked about, I think you touched on this a bit, but it sounds like

976
00:56:12,463 --> 00:56:17,969
a lot of creating volition comes from aligning narrative and player choice, so theoretically

977
00:56:18,649 --> 00:56:22,873
perfectly aligned narrative with absolutely no dissonance between player choice and narrative

978
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:25,195
would have very strong volition, is that right?

979
00:56:28,038 --> 00:56:31,801
It would have, well I think you're describing like a movie.

980
00:56:33,947 --> 00:56:36,769
So, what I would say is that movies are awesome.

981
00:56:37,529 --> 00:56:41,871
You know, in other words, people get very involved in these experiences, and yes, they

982
00:56:41,891 --> 00:56:46,453
can be very volitionally engaging, but, you know, are they...

983
00:56:47,975 --> 00:56:51,817
but they aren't really the, they aren't as engaging as games

984
00:56:51,857 --> 00:56:55,560
that give them more opportunity for all the other things

985
00:56:55,580 --> 00:56:57,041
that you saw reflected in the model.

986
00:56:57,641 --> 00:57:00,823
So things like the ability to grow and conquer challenges

987
00:57:00,883 --> 00:57:04,766
and you know, have relationships and those things,

988
00:57:06,907 --> 00:57:09,529
those things are not as deeply satisfied

989
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:13,292
in just a simple, perfectly aligned linear thing.

990
00:57:13,852 --> 00:57:16,194
And they certainly don't provide as much value.

991
00:57:17,252 --> 00:57:22,914
as something that can provide 200, 300, 400 hours, I guess if you could tell a 400-hour

992
00:57:22,974 --> 00:57:26,195
story, but I've never seen that done, right?

993
00:57:26,635 --> 00:57:27,195
Yeah.

994
00:57:27,776 --> 00:57:33,178
So, anyway, it's, people are volitionally engaged, but they know when they're not writing

995
00:57:33,198 --> 00:57:37,820
the story, and systems to let them write the story in our research are more powerful than

996
00:57:37,860 --> 00:57:38,020
that.

997
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:44,202
Okay, yeah, I guess I'm kind of asking more around the hypothetical, which is probably

998
00:57:44,242 --> 00:57:45,783
not possible, but the idea of...

999
00:57:46,675 --> 00:57:52,698
If the narrative drives for the player were perfectly aligned with what the player wanted

1000
00:57:52,718 --> 00:57:58,300
to do, the act or the lack of breadth of choice could almost be hidden.

1001
00:57:59,941 --> 00:58:03,703
So in a situation like that, like a narrative...

1002
00:58:03,763 --> 00:58:04,323
I'm sorry, I missed that.

1003
00:58:04,403 --> 00:58:05,763
Involves you what?

1004
00:58:05,863 --> 00:58:06,944
The breadth of choice involves you?

1005
00:58:08,053 --> 00:58:10,915
Oh, sorry, the breadth of choice would just become hidden, somewhat.

1006
00:58:10,975 --> 00:58:14,658
So if my... what I want to do as a player is always what the game allows me to do,

1007
00:58:15,899 --> 00:58:20,943
theoretically there should be no difference between a fully, like, procedurally generated game

1008
00:58:20,963 --> 00:58:23,925
where I actually have every choice, because I'm always doing the thing I want to do.

1009
00:58:24,386 --> 00:58:27,468
But I'm wondering if you've thought about that at all, like, in terms of...

1010
00:58:27,548 --> 00:58:30,450
Well, that's... you're gonna run into the mind reading problem there, big time.

1011
00:58:30,791 --> 00:58:31,791
I mean, that's the issue.

1012
00:58:32,152 --> 00:58:36,715
It's like, so in a universe, why not? I mean, I was doing it, let's do it with you.

1013
00:58:37,172 --> 00:58:39,253
in a universe where you could create a game where

1014
00:58:39,273 --> 00:58:43,576
uh... every turn that the player made was, they thought they were ultimate turns

1015
00:58:43,616 --> 00:58:47,019
but it was only that turn and it just kind of followed them perfectly and so

1016
00:58:47,059 --> 00:58:48,960
you could deeply realize it and crush it

1017
00:58:49,841 --> 00:58:52,202
that would be awesome. I don't think it's, I don't think it's...

1018
00:58:52,402 --> 00:58:54,704
I think I'll just try to rephrase the question

1019
00:58:56,625 --> 00:59:00,050
Is it a game like, say, an Uncharted game or A Last of Us,

1020
00:59:01,071 --> 00:59:06,078
do you think those actually have potential for the same levels of volition as a more open-world game?

1021
00:59:06,098 --> 00:59:11,325
Or are they just inherently better at dealing with other needs or satisfying other needs?

1022
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:18,191
I think that when people find, in those games, when people find the narrative engaging and

1023
00:59:18,211 --> 00:59:24,473
they feel like the needs are being satisfied for their sense of competence or connection

1024
00:59:24,493 --> 00:59:29,334
to NPCs or whatever those things are, that they are volitionally engaged in those experiences.

1025
00:59:29,914 --> 00:59:34,795
I think they're simply at a competitive disadvantage to other games that are giving them all these

1026
00:59:34,855 --> 00:59:37,095
tools to more fully realize a personal narrative.

1027
00:59:37,955 --> 00:59:43,379
So, I mean, you know, so that's a little bit different than saying this one's worse at volition than this one is.

1028
00:59:43,859 --> 00:59:48,102
Because I think if you took in the moment, is the person volitionally into this?

1029
00:59:48,282 --> 00:59:52,845
I think that there are certainly going to be moments when the games align, as you point out,

1030
00:59:52,865 --> 00:59:54,686
where people are going to have volitional engagement.

1031
00:59:54,806 --> 00:59:58,529
I think it's looking at it this other way that I would say that, you know,

1032
00:59:58,569 --> 01:00:01,771
this is a main reason why that genre has largely died out.

1033
01:00:02,071 --> 01:00:03,532
Yeah, that's perfect. Thanks.

1034
01:00:06,481 --> 01:00:08,643
Real quickly you talked about

1035
01:00:09,323 --> 01:00:12,545
Your examples you talked about Skyrim and games like the Witcher

1036
01:00:12,965 --> 01:00:17,688
One of the things that's so different about those games is Skyrim kind of gives you the avatar suit

1037
01:00:18,429 --> 01:00:22,771
Unless you've sort of made that character anyone you wanted to be and customizes race gender all that stuff

1038
01:00:22,971 --> 01:00:26,413
Yeah, did you guys ever collect any data or have any findings or try to isolate?

1039
01:00:27,134 --> 01:00:27,254
What?

1040
01:00:28,028 --> 01:00:32,450
the engagement rate versus, you know, players that get to choose exactly who they want to

1041
01:00:32,490 --> 01:00:35,611
be versus somebody who steps into a Shepard or a Gerald.

1042
01:00:36,172 --> 01:00:36,352
Yeah.

1043
01:00:36,772 --> 01:00:40,173
So I have, we haven't looked at that recently, but I've looked at that, you know, in the

1044
01:00:40,214 --> 01:00:47,457
past and from a volitional standpoint, there's not a major, there's not a massive impact

1045
01:00:47,497 --> 01:00:48,517
of those things, right?

1046
01:00:48,938 --> 01:00:52,839
Because the reality is that regardless of who I skin myself as in that game...

1047
01:00:53,681 --> 01:00:57,262
whether I get to pick the skin or whether you make me shepherd or somebody,

1048
01:00:57,862 --> 01:01:02,183
that what the research does show and that we know we've answered pretty definitively

1049
01:01:02,323 --> 01:01:05,904
is that there used to be a debate of do people get into games so that they can,

1050
01:01:06,324 --> 01:01:09,925
you know, do crazy things and pretend they're a plate of,

1051
01:01:09,945 --> 01:01:12,545
you know, sentient spaghetti and whatever.

1052
01:01:13,385 --> 01:01:16,426
And games allow you to be anybody? That's not what players do.

1053
01:01:16,946 --> 01:01:21,107
Because they want to feel volitional engagement, have needs satisfied, they've...

1054
01:01:21,707 --> 01:01:25,469
They've optimized how to do that by actually being who they are

1055
01:01:25,589 --> 01:01:28,530
and wanting the game to let them be who they are, right?

1056
01:01:28,870 --> 01:01:31,351
And so they're going to tell player narrative whether they're,

1057
01:01:31,931 --> 01:01:34,993
you know, whether they have to play Shepard and they don't

1058
01:01:35,033 --> 01:01:38,474
like the color of his, you know, shoes isn't really going

1059
01:01:38,494 --> 01:01:38,894
to matter.

1060
01:01:39,014 --> 01:01:42,236
They're going to, you know, essentially be looking

1061
01:01:42,296 --> 01:01:44,377
at the core mechanics of the game and narrative

1062
01:01:44,397 --> 01:01:46,097
and everything in order to tell their story.

1063
01:01:46,718 --> 01:01:46,898
So.

1064
01:01:48,358 --> 01:01:48,618
Thank you.

1065
01:01:48,778 --> 01:01:48,898
Yeah.

1066
01:01:50,683 --> 01:01:55,038
How much? Oh, we're done? All right. I'm sorry, I'm being, I'm giving this sign. That sounds

1067
01:01:55,078 --> 01:01:57,025
serious, so. Thank you very much, everybody.
