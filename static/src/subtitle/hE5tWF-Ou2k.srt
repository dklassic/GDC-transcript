00:00:05,853 --> 00:00:08,975
Hi everyone, welcome to Evolving God of War's combat for a new perspective.

2
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:13,878
Thanks for coming by on the last day of GDC, after what was I'm sure an exciting but very

3
00:00:13,918 --> 00:00:14,498
tiring week.

4
00:00:15,139 --> 00:00:17,200
As a quick show of hands, who here played God of War?

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,581
Oh shit, alright.

6
00:00:19,701 --> 00:00:20,542
Well, that's cool.

7
00:00:20,782 --> 00:00:23,723
So who here played on the Give Me God of War difficulty?

8
00:00:26,625 --> 00:00:27,826
I apologize for your pain.

9
00:00:31,728 --> 00:00:35,030
So my name's Mihir Sheh, and I'm the lead combat designer here at Santa Monica Studio.

10
00:00:36,805 --> 00:00:40,789
Joining me during the Q&A will be our Gameplay Director and former Gameplay Engineering Lead,

11
00:00:40,949 --> 00:00:41,429
Geet Shroff.

12
00:00:42,931 --> 00:00:47,735
Together, we worked alongside a host of talented gameplay designers and engineers in evolving

13
00:00:47,775 --> 00:00:50,157
our combat systems on 2018's God of War.

14
00:00:51,138 --> 00:00:54,441
Though I'm the one up here presenting today, everything I'm about to go through is the

15
00:00:54,481 --> 00:00:55,622
culmination of a team's effort.

16
00:00:56,442 --> 00:00:58,064
You've got a lot to cover, so let's get started.

17
00:01:00,478 --> 00:01:02,799
For those unfamiliar with past and present God of War,

18
00:01:03,259 --> 00:01:04,980
here's a small video to give context

19
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,680
to the evolution in combat that took place.

20
00:01:07,941 --> 00:01:10,882
God of War is a third-person action-adventure game series

21
00:01:11,202 --> 00:01:13,163
where you play as the Spartan demigod Kratos

22
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:16,044
and use your legendary weaponry to overcome obstacles

23
00:01:16,084 --> 00:01:16,924
in a visceral delight.

24
00:01:18,005 --> 00:01:20,266
Clearly, the two games shown look very different,

25
00:01:20,786 --> 00:01:22,727
but the gameplay design underneath both of them

26
00:01:22,907 --> 00:01:23,847
shares common DNA.

27
00:01:24,968 --> 00:01:27,309
To talk about combat evolution, we first

28
00:01:27,369 --> 00:01:28,149
need to look at the past.

29
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,570
What was the traditional core of God of War's combat?

30
00:01:33,491 --> 00:01:35,293
For over a decade, the series' combat

31
00:01:35,313 --> 00:01:36,934
has focused on a few central pillars.

32
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:41,318
Fundamentally, we wanted to adapt the intensity and finesse

33
00:01:41,438 --> 00:01:43,159
of Japanese action games to the West.

34
00:01:44,921 --> 00:01:47,263
In doing so, we aim to expand the audience

35
00:01:47,543 --> 00:01:49,545
by increasing the accessibility of gameplay

36
00:01:49,945 --> 00:01:52,327
and bringing over-the-top, bombastic presentation

37
00:01:52,347 --> 00:01:52,908
to the forefront.

38
00:01:54,815 --> 00:01:57,017
Kratos was a character all about offense,

39
00:01:57,457 --> 00:01:59,038
and the power fantasy of our combat

40
00:01:59,298 --> 00:02:02,100
represented that by making fighting your enemies feel

41
00:02:02,180 --> 00:02:03,181
like playing with your food.

42
00:02:05,742 --> 00:02:07,323
And of course, all of this was done

43
00:02:07,464 --> 00:02:10,285
from a pulled-back, game-controlled camera that

44
00:02:10,325 --> 00:02:12,807
framed all of the action in a way that was larger than life.

45
00:02:13,808 --> 00:02:15,889
Each game in the series built upon the foundations

46
00:02:15,949 --> 00:02:18,211
of the original by refining combat mechanics

47
00:02:18,391 --> 00:02:20,512
and escalating spectacle to epic proportions.

48
00:02:22,783 --> 00:02:25,325
With this new God of War, however, the overall vision

49
00:02:25,385 --> 00:02:27,346
demanded a more grounded and intimate tone.

50
00:02:28,586 --> 00:02:31,007
This applied to all aspects of the game, including combat.

51
00:02:32,808 --> 00:02:34,229
And there was so much new with this vision.

52
00:02:34,789 --> 00:02:37,210
The Norse mythology, a new Melian range weapon

53
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:40,671
in the Leviathan axe, and a new player-controlled close camera

54
00:02:40,751 --> 00:02:41,472
that never cut.

55
00:02:42,512 --> 00:02:44,573
And of course, I'm skipping over a brand new companion.

56
00:02:45,213 --> 00:02:46,434
If you want to learn more about that

57
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,515
and missed Hayato Yoshidome's talk yesterday,

58
00:02:48,955 --> 00:02:50,816
check out his talk, Raising a Trace for Battle

59
00:02:50,956 --> 00:02:51,936
when it hits the GDC vault.

60
00:02:53,358 --> 00:02:57,301
So the idea behind the new camera was to create a more visceral experience that brought you

61
00:02:57,381 --> 00:03:00,944
closer to Kratos, and to make the combat more deliberate and unflinching.

62
00:03:02,666 --> 00:03:05,709
This would fundamentally change the combat experience of the franchise.

63
00:03:07,070 --> 00:03:08,010
And it had to be better.

64
00:03:10,172 --> 00:03:12,835
Well, that meant two very clear things.

65
00:03:14,096 --> 00:03:18,500
We knew we couldn't refine and iterate on the combat formula that existed like previous

66
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:19,080
titles had done.

67
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:24,751
Instead, we would have to reimagine combat for this new style of game, and it would have

68
00:03:24,791 --> 00:03:26,511
to be largely governed by the camera.

69
00:03:28,552 --> 00:03:33,413
And in this new style, we also wanted to retain the core identity of what fans know and love

70
00:03:33,453 --> 00:03:34,553
about God of War's combat.

71
00:03:37,233 --> 00:03:39,954
And these goals drove us insane, right?

72
00:03:40,214 --> 00:03:43,015
At the time, these two things were completely at odds with each other.

73
00:03:43,747 --> 00:03:47,149
fulfill an offensive power fantasy with a fast and intense action,

74
00:03:47,829 --> 00:03:50,031
but for a more grounded game with a super close camera.

75
00:03:50,771 --> 00:03:53,893
It was really funny seeing people's response when we eventually showed the game

76
00:03:54,554 --> 00:03:55,575
for the first time at E3.

77
00:03:56,255 --> 00:03:59,057
You know, people thankfully responded really positively overall,

78
00:03:59,517 --> 00:04:00,818
but many kept saying,

79
00:04:00,838 --> 00:04:03,740
I don't know, they should have pulled the camera back,

80
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,061
you can't really see anything.

81
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:09,344
The internet was experiencing what we agonized over for years.

82
00:04:10,925 --> 00:04:13,206
But let's roll back a bit to understand what I mean by that.

83
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,160
To know why these two goals were a problem,

84
00:04:16,661 --> 00:04:19,562
we have to dive in a bit deeper into the tangible elements

85
00:04:19,742 --> 00:04:22,063
which define the combat identity of God of War.

86
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,364
Now, obviously, you're doing a lot of things

87
00:04:25,384 --> 00:04:26,105
while playing the game.

88
00:04:26,605 --> 00:04:28,566
But I'm focusing on what you're doing most of the time,

89
00:04:28,946 --> 00:04:31,707
which is fighting basic grunt enemies, such as the Draugr.

90
00:04:33,107 --> 00:04:34,688
At the heart of God of War's combat design

91
00:04:34,748 --> 00:04:37,129
for moment-to-moment gameplay lies four tenets.

92
00:04:39,319 --> 00:04:41,641
Responsive and combo-oriented gameplay

93
00:04:41,881 --> 00:04:44,742
leads to varied and exaggerated enemy hit reactions.

94
00:04:48,045 --> 00:04:51,667
Satisfying and powerful attacks move you forward physically

95
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:52,367
through the space.

96
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,011
Kratos can handle and often excels

97
00:04:58,331 --> 00:04:59,512
when he fights multiple enemies.

98
00:05:02,954 --> 00:05:05,635
And finally, gameplay and controls are accessible,

99
00:05:06,276 --> 00:05:08,337
hassle-free, and are on the player's side.

100
00:05:12,428 --> 00:05:18,454
Now, with that in mind, most other action games with similar types of camera perspectives

101
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:24,640
are designed to focus primarily on one-versus-one combat with a lock-on system, not on fluidly

102
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,002
fighting multiple enemies together.

103
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:31,347
They tend to have combat loops which promote relatively defensive and cautious player behavior

104
00:05:31,407 --> 00:05:34,651
compared to traditional action games, as it's harder to see your surroundings.

105
00:05:35,645 --> 00:05:38,207
The player's attacks typically don't translate them forward

106
00:05:38,227 --> 00:05:40,769
through the space in order to help with the camera framing.

107
00:05:41,389 --> 00:05:44,532
And it keeps combat aimed at gauging the distance and timing

108
00:05:44,552 --> 00:05:46,313
of attacks, as opposed to manipulating

109
00:05:46,393 --> 00:05:47,434
fun enemy hit reactions.

110
00:05:48,235 --> 00:05:49,776
And this is all for good reason, right?

111
00:05:49,996 --> 00:05:51,017
Players love these games.

112
00:05:51,557 --> 00:05:52,798
And these types of combat systems

113
00:05:52,999 --> 00:05:55,561
make sense for a closer camera, since the combat

114
00:05:55,641 --> 00:05:56,401
is designed around it.

115
00:05:58,443 --> 00:06:00,665
Unfortunately, this was not the case for us

116
00:06:00,745 --> 00:06:01,646
in our combat identity.

117
00:06:02,567 --> 00:06:04,548
we needed to stick to our special ingredients

118
00:06:04,688 --> 00:06:06,269
if we wanted to deliver a different,

119
00:06:06,689 --> 00:06:08,390
but true God of War experience.

120
00:06:09,370 --> 00:06:11,151
We needed players of all skill levels

121
00:06:11,211 --> 00:06:12,992
to be confident and offensive,

122
00:06:13,452 --> 00:06:14,973
and it didn't seem like this was possible

123
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:15,934
with the proposed change.

124
00:06:16,674 --> 00:06:17,815
In fact, in the beginning,

125
00:06:18,335 --> 00:06:20,776
many of us on the combat team were really opposed

126
00:06:20,796 --> 00:06:22,297
to the new camera for this very reason.

127
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,119
But the vision was set,

128
00:06:25,459 --> 00:06:27,240
and after many initial months of squirming

129
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,020
and fighting about it,

130
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,842
we trusted in the vision and committed to the thought

131
00:06:30,942 --> 00:06:32,002
that we were going to make it work.

132
00:06:34,421 --> 00:06:35,061
And it wasn't easy.

133
00:06:36,042 --> 00:06:38,043
Our early attempts of making the camera mesh together

134
00:06:38,083 --> 00:06:40,085
with combat did not go well, as you might imagine.

135
00:06:41,005 --> 00:06:43,287
Frankly speaking, it was terrible to play.

136
00:06:43,707 --> 00:06:45,589
And it was almost impossible for players

137
00:06:45,609 --> 00:06:47,010
to make sense of what was going on around them.

138
00:06:47,670 --> 00:06:49,171
I mean, can you guys tell what the enemies are doing

139
00:06:49,191 --> 00:06:49,632
in the video?

140
00:06:50,072 --> 00:06:50,993
Because I sure can't.

141
00:06:52,193 --> 00:06:54,515
Players just panicked, evaded around constantly,

142
00:06:54,895 --> 00:06:56,937
and mashed buttons without a semblance of strategy

143
00:06:56,997 --> 00:06:59,118
because the combat systems were fighting the camera

144
00:06:59,158 --> 00:07:01,780
in a way that made gameplay extremely clunky.

145
00:07:04,188 --> 00:07:06,690
To solve this, we had to reevaluate our combat

146
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:10,512
late into the fall of 2016 and go forward with the strategy.

147
00:07:11,673 --> 00:07:13,975
For players to play confidently and offensively,

148
00:07:14,335 --> 00:07:16,697
we needed to remove as much clunkiness as we could.

149
00:07:17,517 --> 00:07:19,579
After the initial adjustment of getting used to the game,

150
00:07:20,019 --> 00:07:22,981
the difficulty needed to come from the game itself and not

151
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,042
the controls and camera.

152
00:07:25,143 --> 00:07:27,144
If we didn't get this right, players

153
00:07:27,164 --> 00:07:29,126
would be discouraged to experiment with our combat

154
00:07:29,566 --> 00:07:31,687
and would maybe even rely on the pattern of play

155
00:07:31,727 --> 00:07:33,789
that they're used to in some of the games I showed before.

156
00:07:36,361 --> 00:07:38,742
So with these challenges and goals framed,

157
00:07:39,142 --> 00:07:40,703
we broke down the core combat systems

158
00:07:40,823 --> 00:07:42,944
and identified the aspects which we needed to solve.

159
00:07:45,085 --> 00:07:49,508
Tracking, targeting, and engaging enemies.

160
00:07:50,268 --> 00:07:51,329
And I'm excited to go through them

161
00:07:51,489 --> 00:07:53,490
with more technical detail and share some of what

162
00:07:53,530 --> 00:07:54,310
we learned in the process.

163
00:07:55,351 --> 00:07:56,872
If you would like to hear more about the design

164
00:07:56,912 --> 00:07:59,273
process covered in this section, Jason McDonald,

165
00:07:59,453 --> 00:08:01,654
our design director, did a great talk on this yesterday

166
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,395
called Taking an Axe to God of War Gameplay.

167
00:08:03,715 --> 00:08:05,356
And it should be up on the vault soon for you to check out.

168
00:08:07,807 --> 00:08:09,007
Let's start with tracking enemies,

169
00:08:09,787 --> 00:08:12,288
by which I mean everything related to enabling players

170
00:08:12,428 --> 00:08:14,128
to be aware of threats in the fight.

171
00:08:17,289 --> 00:08:19,389
In order to track enemies, the player

172
00:08:19,429 --> 00:08:21,690
has to have an idea of who the active threats are.

173
00:08:22,650 --> 00:08:24,491
You could be fighting eight enemies at a time,

174
00:08:24,971 --> 00:08:26,311
but which group should you really

175
00:08:26,351 --> 00:08:27,711
be paying the closest attention to?

176
00:08:29,032 --> 00:08:31,072
Aggressiveness affects how enemies will behave

177
00:08:31,452 --> 00:08:32,753
and where they will position themselves.

178
00:08:33,767 --> 00:08:36,127
our enemies can be either aggressive or non-aggressive

179
00:08:36,167 --> 00:08:36,568
in a fight.

180
00:08:37,328 --> 00:08:39,249
Think of it kind of like a scene in a kung fu movie.

181
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,810
Aggressive enemies are those who are actively

182
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:43,590
trying to attack the player in the front,

183
00:08:44,150 --> 00:08:46,271
while non-aggressive enemies hang around in the back

184
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:47,732
and wait to become aggressive.

185
00:08:48,952 --> 00:08:51,553
So how do we select who is aggressive at any moment

186
00:08:51,753 --> 00:08:52,253
and who isn't?

187
00:08:53,314 --> 00:08:56,075
We mostly updated our old aggression scoring and token

188
00:08:56,095 --> 00:08:57,555
system from God of War Ascension,

189
00:08:58,095 --> 00:08:59,436
but accounted for the new camera.

190
00:09:01,942 --> 00:09:04,404
We evaluate all enemies in the fight periodically

191
00:09:04,464 --> 00:09:07,146
on a short timer and give them a numerical aggression

192
00:09:07,166 --> 00:09:10,028
score built by the following criteria in order of importance.

193
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:14,371
Can the enemy become aggressive?

194
00:09:14,992 --> 00:09:16,533
And this is to ensure that they're not

195
00:09:16,613 --> 00:09:18,334
in a hit reaction or in a similar state

196
00:09:18,414 --> 00:09:19,775
where they're barred from becoming aggressive.

197
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,878
The second is, what's their aggression priority?

198
00:09:24,579 --> 00:09:26,701
And this is a number set by designers per enemy type

199
00:09:27,281 --> 00:09:29,483
along with the range in which the priority is applied.

200
00:09:30,197 --> 00:09:33,961
So a high priority, like a really big ogre who's super far away,

201
00:09:34,381 --> 00:09:37,325
doesn't out-prioritize a lower enemy, like the draugr,

202
00:09:37,485 --> 00:09:38,846
who's already close to the player.

203
00:09:41,189 --> 00:09:44,733
The third is, is the enemy currently targeted by the player?

204
00:09:45,454 --> 00:09:46,815
And I'll go over this in more detail

205
00:09:46,855 --> 00:09:48,657
soon in the targeting enemies section of the talk.

206
00:09:50,862 --> 00:09:53,364
And finally, what's the enemy's action rank?

207
00:09:53,945 --> 00:09:55,266
And this is a calculation that looks

208
00:09:55,306 --> 00:09:56,907
at whether they are on or off screen,

209
00:09:57,428 --> 00:10:00,110
their angle from the camera, and their distance from Kratos.

210
00:10:02,652 --> 00:10:04,153
The enemies are sorted with a score

211
00:10:04,574 --> 00:10:07,256
and are handed aggression tokens from a fixed pool in order.

212
00:10:08,197 --> 00:10:09,978
Each enemy type can claim a different number

213
00:10:10,018 --> 00:10:12,881
of aggression tokens to signify size or importance.

214
00:10:13,481 --> 00:10:15,163
And after the max token count is reached,

215
00:10:15,643 --> 00:10:17,405
all others in the list become non-aggressive.

216
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:21,153
In this example, the player has a pool of 14 tokens.

217
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:24,695
In the table, the outline column on the right

218
00:10:24,856 --> 00:10:26,777
denotes how many tokens that enemy claims.

219
00:10:27,897 --> 00:10:30,359
After the third enemy, the pool of 14 runs out,

220
00:10:30,739 --> 00:10:32,840
and the remaining enemy is set to be non-aggressive.

221
00:10:34,541 --> 00:10:36,943
The outline column on the left shows who is aggressive,

222
00:10:37,023 --> 00:10:39,304
and as you can see, only the blue enemy

223
00:10:39,364 --> 00:10:40,285
was set to non-aggressive,

224
00:10:40,305 --> 00:10:41,466
because he's missing the asterisk.

225
00:10:43,207 --> 00:10:44,547
And you can even see this in the image.

226
00:10:45,648 --> 00:10:47,049
He's standing all the way in the back.

227
00:10:48,457 --> 00:10:50,217
Careful tuning of these values helps

228
00:10:50,257 --> 00:10:52,538
to ensure that the player always has a manageable threat

229
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:53,158
at any time.

230
00:10:54,138 --> 00:10:56,079
These values are also changed for difficulty

231
00:10:56,379 --> 00:10:59,320
to either increase or decrease the overall enemy aggression.

232
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:03,721
Once we know which enemies are aggressive

233
00:11:03,841 --> 00:11:05,581
and which are non-aggressive, we have

234
00:11:05,601 --> 00:11:07,342
to figure out where they want to be in the fight space.

235
00:11:08,282 --> 00:11:10,283
Positioning needed a complete overhaul

236
00:11:10,623 --> 00:11:12,923
and was built from the ground up with this new camera in mind.

237
00:11:15,767 --> 00:11:18,747
In older God of War games, enemies used their aggressiveness

238
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:21,648
to determine whether they should stand near or far from the player,

239
00:11:22,208 --> 00:11:24,088
effectively surrounding Kratos in two circles.

240
00:11:25,449 --> 00:11:28,129
There was no notion of nicely spreading the enemies out

241
00:11:28,569 --> 00:11:30,389
or caring about one area more than another.

242
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,510
The pulled-back camera allowed you to see everyone at all times,

243
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,311
so it was easy to perceive your threats.

244
00:11:36,951 --> 00:11:40,211
And non-aggressive enemies occasionally moved around the perimeter of the fight

245
00:11:40,572 --> 00:11:42,092
just to keep the scene a bit more dynamic.

246
00:11:43,392 --> 00:11:43,892
Now, however...

247
00:11:44,502 --> 00:11:46,383
Enemies could be on screen or off screen,

248
00:11:46,883 --> 00:11:48,765
and where they stand relative to your perspective

249
00:11:48,925 --> 00:11:50,126
is extremely important.

250
00:11:51,026 --> 00:11:53,228
The camera perspective makes depth perception

251
00:11:53,368 --> 00:11:54,949
more difficult to gauge distances,

252
00:11:55,469 --> 00:11:57,131
and enemies in front obscured those

253
00:11:57,171 --> 00:11:58,031
who were standing behind them.

254
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:00,553
As such, we needed to make sure

255
00:12:00,673 --> 00:12:01,814
enemies spread out comfortably.

256
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:05,236
Early on in the project,

257
00:12:05,497 --> 00:12:07,838
we tried to find the optimal positions for each enemy

258
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:09,740
using a weight-based positioning system.

259
00:12:11,057 --> 00:12:13,617
We used a fixed-size circular grid around Kratos,

260
00:12:13,957 --> 00:12:15,938
which would update periodically as he moved around.

261
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:19,079
Each grid position would evaluate itself

262
00:12:19,199 --> 00:12:20,780
by checking if it was on the navmesh

263
00:12:21,420 --> 00:12:23,320
and if it had a valid straight path to Kratos.

264
00:12:24,761 --> 00:12:26,081
Valid positions were then weighted

265
00:12:26,221 --> 00:12:27,682
based on many different heuristics.

266
00:12:30,343 --> 00:12:32,183
There were a few valuable learnings early on

267
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:34,484
from using the system, but over time,

268
00:12:34,604 --> 00:12:36,645
it became clear that we needed another solution.

269
00:12:37,533 --> 00:12:40,175
the weight structure became monolithic, complicated,

270
00:12:40,315 --> 00:12:43,296
and messy, making it almost impossible to debug

271
00:12:43,316 --> 00:12:45,657
effectively, which you might be able to guess by looking at that.

272
00:12:47,198 --> 00:12:49,058
Weights kept constantly getting invalidated

273
00:12:49,198 --> 00:12:50,939
due to both player and enemy movement,

274
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:53,640
and enemies frequently bunched together because of this.

275
00:12:55,281 --> 00:12:58,322
Most importantly, we saw from early internal testing

276
00:12:58,462 --> 00:13:01,163
that players immediately got scared as soon as an enemy went

277
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:05,045
off screen, and shut down any kind of offensive or confident

278
00:13:05,085 --> 00:13:05,505
gameplay.

279
00:13:06,528 --> 00:13:07,409
that they were engaged in.

280
00:13:08,530 --> 00:13:09,710
It didn't look like God of War.

281
00:13:10,731 --> 00:13:12,453
We needed players to build a mental map

282
00:13:12,633 --> 00:13:14,074
of enemy locations in the fight

283
00:13:14,314 --> 00:13:15,976
so they could feel comfortable in combat.

284
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,920
After almost a year of iteration,

285
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:22,521
we scrapped the system entirely.

286
00:13:23,422 --> 00:13:25,063
This time, driven by the badness

287
00:13:25,123 --> 00:13:26,384
of managing the complex weights,

288
00:13:26,925 --> 00:13:29,026
we changed the goal from picking optimal positions

289
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:31,328
for each enemy to something far simpler,

290
00:13:32,029 --> 00:13:34,411
prevent enemies from getting into bad positions.

291
00:13:35,735 --> 00:13:38,276
This led to a strict zone constraint-based positioning

292
00:13:38,316 --> 00:13:38,596
system.

293
00:13:39,756 --> 00:13:41,857
The system required each enemy to have two elements,

294
00:13:42,657 --> 00:13:44,517
a positional constraint, which is basically

295
00:13:44,897 --> 00:13:48,118
where do I want to stand, and a separation constraint, which

296
00:13:48,178 --> 00:13:49,358
is how much space do I take.

297
00:13:50,338 --> 00:13:51,758
As long as these constraints were met,

298
00:13:52,299 --> 00:13:54,019
no position was better than any other.

299
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,819
Both constraints would take the form of zones

300
00:13:56,979 --> 00:13:58,320
and would be fully data-driven.

301
00:13:59,060 --> 00:14:01,120
These zones required a minimum amount of navmesh

302
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:01,720
to be available.

303
00:14:02,321 --> 00:14:04,341
Otherwise, more lenient fallback zones would be used.

304
00:14:06,893 --> 00:14:08,974
Instead of using a grid that moved around Kratos,

305
00:14:09,374 --> 00:14:11,695
we generated a grid on the nav mesh in world space.

306
00:14:14,036 --> 00:14:16,077
The positional constraint we used for aggressive enemies

307
00:14:16,317 --> 00:14:18,338
was this kind of crescent shape in front of Kratos

308
00:14:18,358 --> 00:14:19,058
to keep them on screen.

309
00:14:19,478 --> 00:14:20,779
And you can see that in the image in red.

310
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:24,020
This particular shape played well

311
00:14:24,041 --> 00:14:26,342
with the camera's perspective and prevented enemies

312
00:14:26,382 --> 00:14:28,302
in the back of the zone from standing off screen

313
00:14:28,382 --> 00:14:29,103
as you move forward.

314
00:14:30,406 --> 00:14:32,507
Non-aggressive enemies would just stand around Kratos

315
00:14:32,547 --> 00:14:34,647
in a wide circle, similar to old God of War,

316
00:14:35,047 --> 00:14:37,388
since they didn't care about being on or off screen.

317
00:14:40,509 --> 00:14:42,109
Separation constraints, the one that

318
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,930
specify how much space an enemy takes, had different shapes.

319
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:47,971
The aggressive enemies simply used a radius

320
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:49,312
to define how much space they took,

321
00:14:49,992 --> 00:14:52,332
so no other creature was allowed to stand in their circle.

322
00:14:53,993 --> 00:14:57,414
Non-aggressive enemies, however, had a wider, angled separation

323
00:14:57,454 --> 00:14:59,635
constraint that kind of looked like a slightly curved

324
00:14:59,675 --> 00:15:00,035
rectangle.

325
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:03,561
This shape was helpful to spread out the enemies laterally

326
00:15:03,581 --> 00:15:05,803
in the back, but didn't take up as much space,

327
00:15:06,183 --> 00:15:08,365
since they could be many more non-aggressive enemies

328
00:15:08,425 --> 00:15:10,446
at any one time than there could be aggressive ones.

329
00:15:11,988 --> 00:15:14,009
This shape also meant that the enemies in the back

330
00:15:14,149 --> 00:15:16,011
could be seen behind enemies in the front.

331
00:15:17,252 --> 00:15:18,973
You can see how this led to enemies being clearly

332
00:15:19,013 --> 00:15:21,155
perceptible by these two images, which

333
00:15:21,175 --> 00:15:22,916
show the same exact enemy layout,

334
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:27,820
but from an aerial and an in-game camera perspective.

335
00:15:30,941 --> 00:15:33,122
This approach had much less nitty-gritty control,

336
00:15:33,423 --> 00:15:34,883
but yielded far better results.

337
00:15:35,824 --> 00:15:37,825
The zone data was easier to author and debug,

338
00:15:38,286 --> 00:15:39,947
and the simplicity of solving the constraints

339
00:15:40,087 --> 00:15:43,669
led to both less frequent and less noisy invalidation.

340
00:15:44,650 --> 00:15:46,291
The constraints also caused the enemies

341
00:15:46,351 --> 00:15:48,612
to sparrow in a way that was much more visually pleasing.

342
00:15:50,213 --> 00:15:52,134
However, it still wasn't perfect.

343
00:15:52,898 --> 00:15:56,721
By making all aggressive enemies want to be in that crescent shape in front of Kratos,

344
00:15:57,342 --> 00:16:01,745
many of the off-screen enemies behind him who had recently become aggressive would walk

345
00:16:01,785 --> 00:16:04,607
directly into the back of him while trying to get on screen.

346
00:16:06,068 --> 00:16:09,811
In fact, off-screen enemies in general were still really hard to track.

347
00:16:10,552 --> 00:16:14,655
You didn't know where they were, and at any time one could turn aggressive and be a new

348
00:16:14,695 --> 00:16:15,676
threat from a blind spot.

349
00:16:17,137 --> 00:16:20,940
Players still didn't have a mental map of the fight, and they couldn't play confidently.

350
00:16:23,152 --> 00:16:25,634
And we relied on this version of positioning for a long time

351
00:16:25,674 --> 00:16:26,234
on the project.

352
00:16:27,114 --> 00:16:29,275
In fact, it was only during the last few months

353
00:16:29,336 --> 00:16:33,058
during intense playtesting that we reexamined it and tried

354
00:16:33,078 --> 00:16:35,039
to address remaining issues that we knew existed.

355
00:16:36,219 --> 00:16:38,520
We had to figure out how enemies could position themselves

356
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,522
in a way that you would just kind of expect as a player.

357
00:16:42,832 --> 00:16:45,233
We employed new techniques to help preserve enemies

358
00:16:45,393 --> 00:16:47,034
as being either on or off screen.

359
00:16:47,474 --> 00:16:50,296
And that's to say that an on-screen enemy should only

360
00:16:50,356 --> 00:16:53,137
go off of the screen if the player caused that to happen.

361
00:16:54,538 --> 00:16:56,959
Similarly, an off-screen enemy who turned aggressive

362
00:16:57,219 --> 00:16:58,900
should not be forced back on screen

363
00:16:59,201 --> 00:17:00,401
until you've looked at it.

364
00:17:01,542 --> 00:17:03,683
And this was all done in logic that assigned the constraint

365
00:17:03,703 --> 00:17:04,363
zones to enemies.

366
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:09,552
Another technique we used was to keep off-screen enemies

367
00:17:09,592 --> 00:17:11,773
in their same world space-oriented quadrant

368
00:17:12,113 --> 00:17:13,353
relative to Kratos' position.

369
00:17:14,414 --> 00:17:15,715
And this was just another zone constraint

370
00:17:15,735 --> 00:17:16,615
that they had to satisfy.

371
00:17:17,916 --> 00:17:20,917
This way, enemies that you weren't actively keeping track of

372
00:17:21,217 --> 00:17:23,938
would stay relatively in the same area as you'd last seen.

373
00:17:24,659 --> 00:17:27,160
So for example, an enemy currently in the back left

374
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,721
of the player's view would stay in that general area.

375
00:17:30,542 --> 00:17:32,883
So if the player turned right and put that enemy off-screen,

376
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,544
they would know that the enemy was now directly behind them.

377
00:17:38,873 --> 00:17:40,494
So here's a demo of the system with enemies

378
00:17:40,514 --> 00:17:42,274
who are not attacking for debug purposes,

379
00:17:42,634 --> 00:17:44,635
but aggressiveness as a system is still on.

380
00:17:45,735 --> 00:17:46,755
Those are two different concepts.

381
00:17:47,635 --> 00:17:48,856
I'll commentate on what's happening,

382
00:17:49,056 --> 00:17:50,756
but the main takeaway is to notice

383
00:17:50,796 --> 00:17:52,556
if the enemies move in a way that you would expect.

384
00:17:53,217 --> 00:17:53,597
Take a look.

385
00:17:55,997 --> 00:17:58,418
So here, both the green and yellow enemies are aggressive

386
00:17:58,778 --> 00:17:59,638
and want to stay on me.

387
00:18:00,758 --> 00:18:02,979
And you can see that as I move around,

388
00:18:03,079 --> 00:18:04,779
they try to stay in that crescent shape.

389
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:10,640
When I move past them, they're offscreen,

390
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,182
and their zone shape changes to be a much wider circle

391
00:18:13,222 --> 00:18:13,782
around the player.

392
00:18:14,863 --> 00:18:17,044
Due to the aggression scoring, the pink enemy,

393
00:18:17,084 --> 00:18:18,885
who's now onscreen, becomes aggressive.

394
00:18:23,768 --> 00:18:25,749
The green enemy stays on Kratos' right side,

395
00:18:25,890 --> 00:18:27,651
even though offscreen, due to the quadrants.

396
00:18:28,351 --> 00:18:30,392
And similarly, the yellow enemy stays to his left.

397
00:18:32,934 --> 00:18:34,755
The green enemy is still treated as offscreen

398
00:18:34,775 --> 00:18:37,356
until Kratos turns around, but once he does,

399
00:18:38,157 --> 00:18:38,457
it's back.

400
00:18:39,207 --> 00:18:40,928
and in that crescent shape again.

401
00:18:44,411 --> 00:18:47,313
And Aggressiveness switches between enemies super frequently

402
00:18:47,353 --> 00:18:48,774
with all that's happening in combat.

403
00:18:49,515 --> 00:18:52,918
But overall, enemies generally stay where you'd expect them to be.

404
00:18:56,841 --> 00:18:59,603
These key improvements, along with many other small changes,

405
00:18:59,783 --> 00:19:01,324
led to significant outcomes.

406
00:19:02,025 --> 00:19:04,867
We were able to solve the on-screen, off-screen problem

407
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:07,649
and prevent enemies from standing in awkward positions.

408
00:19:08,500 --> 00:19:11,682
Quadrants were a huge success in making enemy positions more predictable,

409
00:19:12,062 --> 00:19:14,564
and were especially helpful in more complex environments.

410
00:19:16,245 --> 00:19:19,467
Overall, these changes helped our goal of allowing players

411
00:19:19,507 --> 00:19:22,729
to make mental maps of the battlefield and begin to play confidently.

412
00:19:23,269 --> 00:19:24,610
And this was evident in playtests.

413
00:19:25,170 --> 00:19:27,212
I mean, players, whether they were aware of it or not,

414
00:19:27,312 --> 00:19:29,673
would start to feel confident enough to take risks

415
00:19:29,953 --> 00:19:33,836
and continue to be engaged offensively, even when handling multiple enemies.

416
00:19:36,877 --> 00:19:38,238
To help players further, we wanted

417
00:19:38,278 --> 00:19:40,399
to make them even more aware of off-screen enemies

418
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,121
and what they were doing, without it

419
00:19:42,161 --> 00:19:44,642
being so distracting that it shifted attention away

420
00:19:44,942 --> 00:19:46,563
from threats immediately in front of them.

421
00:19:48,084 --> 00:19:50,046
We knew we didn't want to do something as overt

422
00:19:50,126 --> 00:19:52,447
as a radar or mini-map, so we experimented

423
00:19:52,487 --> 00:19:53,448
with off-screen indicators.

424
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:57,491
Most players just need to know if off-screen enemies were

425
00:19:57,531 --> 00:19:57,931
attacking.

426
00:19:58,351 --> 00:20:00,613
But as they became more and more confident with the game,

427
00:20:01,093 --> 00:20:03,094
it was helpful to get an idea of where even

428
00:20:03,174 --> 00:20:06,136
nearby idle enemies were to best maximize their combat

429
00:20:06,156 --> 00:20:06,556
strategies.

430
00:20:07,542 --> 00:20:09,984
This information could encourage them to be more offensive

431
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:11,465
instead of hanging back all the time.

432
00:20:13,807 --> 00:20:16,929
Early on, we tried flashing the edge of the screen closest

433
00:20:16,949 --> 00:20:18,771
to enemies offscreen, but players

434
00:20:18,811 --> 00:20:20,452
thought they were damage indicators instead.

435
00:20:21,272 --> 00:20:21,713
Not ideal.

436
00:20:22,834 --> 00:20:24,375
We tried many other implementations

437
00:20:24,415 --> 00:20:25,716
which involved the edges of the screen,

438
00:20:26,096 --> 00:20:27,817
but finally settled on changing them

439
00:20:27,897 --> 00:20:30,039
to be arrows which circled around Kratos

440
00:20:30,199 --> 00:20:32,521
and pointed more clearly towards the enemies themselves.

441
00:20:35,389 --> 00:20:37,290
The red indicators are for incoming attacks,

442
00:20:37,771 --> 00:20:39,832
and the more subtle white arrows just

443
00:20:39,892 --> 00:20:41,113
show nearby idling enemies.

444
00:20:41,973 --> 00:20:44,274
And it was important to design the white indicators in a way

445
00:20:44,314 --> 00:20:46,116
that weren't distracting for players who

446
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:47,476
weren't trying to use them.

447
00:20:48,597 --> 00:20:51,099
Range attacks actually had a slightly different purple color

448
00:20:51,179 --> 00:20:52,299
for players who paid attention.

449
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,601
But again, the goal was to not overload information.

450
00:20:56,322 --> 00:20:58,623
If you saw a reddish flashing arrow,

451
00:20:58,963 --> 00:21:00,084
you knew something was coming.

452
00:21:01,252 --> 00:21:02,933
And it's important to point out that the work done

453
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:04,654
on the positioning system described earlier

454
00:21:05,075 --> 00:21:07,656
in terms of reducing the noise and invalidation of enemies

455
00:21:08,237 --> 00:21:10,699
made these off-screen indicators far more stable,

456
00:21:11,059 --> 00:21:13,480
predictable, and easier for players to process.

457
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,324
Our indicators help players track enemies off-screen,

458
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:21,506
but what about enemies that are right in front of us?

459
00:21:22,568 --> 00:21:25,250
Controlling the camera itself with the right analog stick

460
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,051
in the heat of battle is an added complexity this time

461
00:21:28,211 --> 00:21:31,092
that we needed to help make accessible for a wide audience

462
00:21:31,132 --> 00:21:32,153
looking to play an action game.

463
00:21:34,734 --> 00:21:36,595
We tried to find a solution for tracking enemies

464
00:21:36,675 --> 00:21:39,296
without relying on the player to constantly manage the camera

465
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:42,318
by implementing our own version of a camera strafe assist.

466
00:21:45,119 --> 00:21:46,740
The camera will automatically try

467
00:21:46,780 --> 00:21:49,541
to adjust and keep relevant targets and threats in view

468
00:21:49,841 --> 00:21:51,022
when the player moves left or right.

469
00:21:52,035 --> 00:21:54,537
To do this, we wait enemies to find a center point

470
00:21:54,577 --> 00:21:55,637
for the camera to focus on.

471
00:21:56,678 --> 00:21:58,979
In particular, evading laterally really

472
00:21:59,059 --> 00:22:00,179
showed this behavior in action.

473
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,381
We also eventually added a behavior

474
00:22:03,421 --> 00:22:05,241
to reorient the camera automatically

475
00:22:05,602 --> 00:22:07,142
in the direction of Kratos' attacks

476
00:22:07,563 --> 00:22:09,744
to ensure that we reduced frustration for players

477
00:22:09,984 --> 00:22:10,864
struggling with controls.

478
00:22:12,125 --> 00:22:14,186
As many of you likely know, anticipating

479
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:16,587
the players' intentions with how they wanted the camera to behave

480
00:22:17,167 --> 00:22:18,007
is a difficult task.

481
00:22:18,207 --> 00:22:19,468
And we didn't always get it right 100%.

482
00:22:21,003 --> 00:22:22,284
But our playtest proved, however,

483
00:22:22,584 --> 00:22:25,125
that these camera assists dramatically improved gameplay

484
00:22:25,165 --> 00:22:25,865
for most players.

485
00:22:26,366 --> 00:22:27,646
And those who found them frustrating

486
00:22:27,706 --> 00:22:29,127
could just turn them off in the Settings menu.

487
00:22:32,588 --> 00:22:33,849
Now that we've gone through systems that

488
00:22:33,889 --> 00:22:35,129
helped players track their threats,

489
00:22:35,709 --> 00:22:37,070
let's look at others which help players

490
00:22:37,130 --> 00:22:39,591
choose who they wanted to attack by diving into targeting.

491
00:22:44,593 --> 00:22:45,733
In a common fight scene like this,

492
00:22:46,454 --> 00:22:48,234
which enemy should Kratos target when the player

493
00:22:48,294 --> 00:22:49,155
presses the Attack button?

494
00:22:50,116 --> 00:22:51,257
Should it be the bandit on the right,

495
00:22:51,717 --> 00:22:52,979
because he looks like he's the closest?

496
00:22:53,899 --> 00:22:54,820
What about the one in the middle,

497
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:56,081
because he's in the center of the screen?

498
00:22:57,262 --> 00:22:59,344
Or should Kratos just attack directly in front

499
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:00,445
of wherever he's facing,

500
00:23:00,686 --> 00:23:02,167
without aiming at anyone in particular?

501
00:23:02,187 --> 00:23:04,929
This is a pretty complicated problem.

502
00:23:05,770 --> 00:23:08,493
Target selection is an extremely important system for us,

503
00:23:08,813 --> 00:23:11,315
since we need to allow players to fight multiple enemies

504
00:23:11,335 --> 00:23:12,616
at the same time fluidly,

505
00:23:12,957 --> 00:23:14,538
due to the one versus many fantasy.

506
00:23:15,299 --> 00:23:17,120
It's a core part of our combat identity.

507
00:23:17,977 --> 00:23:20,419
We needed to make this possible without requiring players

508
00:23:20,439 --> 00:23:23,022
to use a lock-on system, which was a directive all the way

509
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:23,523
from the top.

510
00:23:25,004 --> 00:23:27,287
A new challenge was also that the Leviathan Axe enabled

511
00:23:27,347 --> 00:23:29,469
both ranged and melee combat on the fly,

512
00:23:30,030 --> 00:23:31,632
and switching between them should be seamless.

513
00:23:32,553 --> 00:23:34,715
A lot of time was spent on this problem in particular

514
00:23:35,155 --> 00:23:36,717
in order to get it feeling just right.

515
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,061
Let's start with melee targeting.

516
00:23:41,203 --> 00:23:43,845
In old God of War games, with the pulled back camera,

517
00:23:44,146 --> 00:23:46,188
we relied heavily on the left analog stick

518
00:23:46,208 --> 00:23:48,410
to decide who Kratos should target with his attacks.

519
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,713
The problem with doing something like that for the new game

520
00:23:52,133 --> 00:23:54,615
is that we didn't want Kratos attacking into the camera

521
00:23:54,816 --> 00:23:55,937
if you pulled back on the stick.

522
00:23:57,178 --> 00:23:59,480
One early approach we took was to kind of make it

523
00:23:59,500 --> 00:24:01,602
like a shooter and have it be entirely

524
00:24:01,642 --> 00:24:03,844
dependent on the reticle point in the center of the camera.

525
00:24:05,578 --> 00:24:06,198
And this didn't work.

526
00:24:06,658 --> 00:24:08,259
It wasn't intuitive for our style of game.

527
00:24:08,499 --> 00:24:10,219
And players kept complaining, you know,

528
00:24:10,239 --> 00:24:11,380
like, why can't I hit that enemy?

529
00:24:11,540 --> 00:24:12,500
He looks like he's right there.

530
00:24:13,601 --> 00:24:15,681
We weren't able to get their intent across.

531
00:24:16,082 --> 00:24:18,022
And the result was gameplay that felt clunky.

532
00:24:20,003 --> 00:24:22,344
The solution ended up being a mix between both the left

533
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:24,685
and right analog stick, as well as other factors.

534
00:24:25,665 --> 00:24:26,805
And we'll take a look at it in action.

535
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:29,926
You'll see a green circle on whoever Kratos' target is

536
00:24:29,966 --> 00:24:30,467
at any time.

537
00:24:32,851 --> 00:24:34,992
So in the beginning, all the enemies are out of range,

538
00:24:35,252 --> 00:24:36,773
and Kratos doesn't have a valid target.

539
00:24:39,614 --> 00:24:41,335
As soon as an enemy comes into range,

540
00:24:41,555 --> 00:24:42,635
it becomes the initial target,

541
00:24:42,795 --> 00:24:44,156
and you can see that with the green circle.

542
00:24:47,597 --> 00:24:49,758
The target will change as the characters move around

543
00:24:49,998 --> 00:24:50,899
due to a lot of weights

544
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:52,539
that are determining the targeting system.

545
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:56,861
If we look at only the right stick and move that around,

546
00:24:57,121 --> 00:24:59,302
you can see that the screen centeredness alone

547
00:24:59,682 --> 00:25:00,863
will not pick the best target.

548
00:25:06,078 --> 00:25:08,980
But characters completely offscreen can't be targets,

549
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:10,260
and that's probably something you can imagine.

550
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:19,746
So inversely, if we only move the left analog stick,

551
00:25:20,567 --> 00:25:22,348
the stick deflection drives the intent,

552
00:25:22,568 --> 00:25:24,630
and you can see the target change as Kratos walks around.

553
00:25:26,211 --> 00:25:28,052
And so as you saw in the video, we still

554
00:25:28,152 --> 00:25:30,393
try to retain the left stick as much as possible

555
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:31,874
as being the main way to show intent,

556
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:34,576
and because it kind of felt familiar to players.

557
00:25:38,613 --> 00:25:40,354
And I'm not going to go into them in too much detail,

558
00:25:40,614 --> 00:25:42,135
but for those curious, here's a list

559
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:44,236
of the factors that played a role in target selection

560
00:25:44,376 --> 00:25:44,856
for reference.

561
00:25:45,357 --> 00:25:46,657
And feel free to take a picture if you want.

562
00:25:48,038 --> 00:25:50,019
As long as there is a viable enemy candidate,

563
00:25:50,339 --> 00:25:52,160
the targeting system will always choose it

564
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,061
over not having any target at all.

565
00:25:54,682 --> 00:25:57,863
You can't choose to attack into an empty space instead

566
00:25:57,904 --> 00:25:58,684
of a valid target.

567
00:25:59,855 --> 00:26:05,379
When there are no possible targets, Kratos will always attack directly forward along the direction of the camera.

568
00:26:05,999 --> 00:26:09,221
You can't steer his attacks left, right, or backwards.

569
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:13,124
And it's also important that we fulfill the fantasy of being Kratos, right?

570
00:26:13,484 --> 00:26:16,746
Like, we don't want him to miss his attacks clumsily when enemies are right in front of him.

571
00:26:17,687 --> 00:26:23,991
So as with past God of War games, if Kratos has a target, all of his attacks are automatically rotated to face them.

572
00:26:27,583 --> 00:26:29,565
One interesting issue that we saw within the studio

573
00:26:29,645 --> 00:26:32,048
during the development was that people control the camera

574
00:26:32,108 --> 00:26:32,768
really differently.

575
00:26:33,509 --> 00:26:35,611
Cory Barlog, the game director, always

576
00:26:35,651 --> 00:26:38,094
had the camera flat, aimed right at the horizon line

577
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:39,916
to get the best cinematic presentation.

578
00:26:41,197 --> 00:26:43,279
Those of us who played the game correctly, of course,

579
00:26:44,140 --> 00:26:45,682
angled the camera down towards the ground

580
00:26:45,742 --> 00:26:48,184
so we had a reference point for judging distances.

581
00:26:49,373 --> 00:26:50,934
Having gameplay that was on your side

582
00:26:51,354 --> 00:26:52,895
meant that regardless of how you played,

583
00:26:53,255 --> 00:26:55,417
we knew it felt terrible to attack and miss

584
00:26:55,457 --> 00:26:57,438
an enemy who looked like it was right in front of you,

585
00:26:58,058 --> 00:26:59,599
even if it really was a good distance away.

586
00:27:02,381 --> 00:27:04,663
We reused an old God of War Ascension feature

587
00:27:04,763 --> 00:27:07,525
called Suck to Target on most of Kratos' attacks

588
00:27:07,585 --> 00:27:08,385
to help with this issue.

589
00:27:09,326 --> 00:27:12,888
Each attack specified a range, speed, and stop distance

590
00:27:13,128 --> 00:27:15,630
which the engine would use to suck Kratos towards his target.

591
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:19,052
This would make it significantly easier to hit enemies.

592
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:24,175
But as with most older systems, suck to target had problems.

593
00:27:24,975 --> 00:27:26,355
From this new camera perspective,

594
00:27:26,615 --> 00:27:29,056
the behavior often felt jarring and disorienting.

595
00:27:29,556 --> 00:27:31,616
And this was especially true if an enemy

596
00:27:31,636 --> 00:27:33,897
was on the side of your screen and cradle sucked towards it

597
00:27:33,937 --> 00:27:36,537
laterally, since the same distance would

598
00:27:36,577 --> 00:27:39,958
appear to be much longer because, once again, depth

599
00:27:40,018 --> 00:27:40,458
perception.

600
00:27:43,739 --> 00:27:46,519
Worst of all was the case where you would be sucked in only

601
00:27:46,579 --> 00:27:48,940
to still miss your attack because the enemy happened

602
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,780
to move right out of range during that time.

603
00:27:55,135 --> 00:27:57,196
So the old SuckToTarget had problems.

604
00:27:58,016 --> 00:27:59,717
We had to update and change the behavior

605
00:27:59,777 --> 00:28:02,539
to help ensure that you reach your target at a specific time

606
00:28:02,559 --> 00:28:03,179
in the animation.

607
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,420
And this is kind of like a simplified form

608
00:28:05,441 --> 00:28:06,141
of motion warping.

609
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:09,623
To help with the jarring lateral suck problem,

610
00:28:09,983 --> 00:28:11,584
we scaled the range of SuckToTarget

611
00:28:11,724 --> 00:28:13,525
depending on the target's angle to Kratos.

612
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,006
The wider the angle, the lower the range.

613
00:28:16,968 --> 00:28:19,630
This way, Kratos would miss his attacks more frequently

614
00:28:19,770 --> 00:28:21,752
against enemies away to the side of the screen

615
00:28:22,032 --> 00:28:23,173
compared to enemies in front of him,

616
00:28:23,674 --> 00:28:25,595
even if they were at the same distance away.

617
00:28:28,258 --> 00:28:29,579
And we were pretty happy with the results.

618
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:32,621
Some of the examples I spoke to target in the video

619
00:28:32,721 --> 00:28:34,303
are obvious over large distances,

620
00:28:34,803 --> 00:28:36,845
but it's actually happening much more frequently

621
00:28:36,865 --> 00:28:37,646
than you might realize.

622
00:28:42,170 --> 00:28:43,511
You'll notice it more when the camera

623
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:44,992
is aimed downwards towards the ground.

624
00:28:52,155 --> 00:28:54,616
As a fun fact, we actually toned down the suck distance

625
00:28:54,656 --> 00:28:56,596
dramatically for our hardest game difficulty,

626
00:28:56,696 --> 00:28:58,436
Gimme God of War, because we wanted

627
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:00,577
players to pay more attention to their positioning in combat.

628
00:29:01,297 --> 00:29:02,617
Once again, I apologize.

629
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:15,420
For our ranged combat targeting, we

630
00:29:15,460 --> 00:29:18,120
look to shooters for guidance on building both aim friction

631
00:29:18,200 --> 00:29:18,880
and zoom snapping.

632
00:29:19,965 --> 00:29:23,568
Aim friction refers to the system slowing the reticle over targets as you pass them

633
00:29:23,588 --> 00:29:23,808
by.

634
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:28,951
And zoom snapping is a system which snaps the reticle directly to a nearby target when

635
00:29:28,971 --> 00:29:29,472
you pull aim.

636
00:29:30,492 --> 00:29:34,915
As you can see, both of these systems were tuned very liberally, as we wanted to encourage

637
00:29:34,975 --> 00:29:38,177
players to mix ranged and melee attacks easily without hassle.

638
00:29:40,619 --> 00:29:42,700
In doing so, we made it on the player's side.

639
00:29:43,401 --> 00:29:46,603
Kratos could both swing and throw while attacking an enemy fluidly.

640
00:29:52,591 --> 00:29:53,852
All right, I know, I know.

641
00:29:54,252 --> 00:29:56,314
I talked earlier about how other games use lock-on

642
00:29:56,414 --> 00:29:57,815
and that it isn't very God of War.

643
00:29:58,816 --> 00:29:59,336
And I meant it.

644
00:29:59,796 --> 00:30:01,518
It was a directive from the top to make the game

645
00:30:01,578 --> 00:30:03,679
completely playable without a lock-on system,

646
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:05,861
since managing lock-on can be cumbersome

647
00:30:06,161 --> 00:30:07,502
and frustrating for many players.

648
00:30:08,443 --> 00:30:10,284
And honestly, for most of development,

649
00:30:10,685 --> 00:30:13,807
right up until really close to ship, sorry, G,

650
00:30:14,407 --> 00:30:15,288
we didn't have it at all.

651
00:30:17,630 --> 00:30:19,992
In the end, however, we realized through playtest feedback

652
00:30:20,032 --> 00:30:22,213
that some players just always wanted lock-on.

653
00:30:22,977 --> 00:30:24,958
partly due to the fact that they were already

654
00:30:24,998 --> 00:30:26,379
familiar with it from other games

655
00:30:26,539 --> 00:30:27,640
and kind of expected the same.

656
00:30:28,741 --> 00:30:30,822
Players approached the game quite differently with lock-on,

657
00:30:31,122 --> 00:30:32,023
and that's OK.

658
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:35,425
But it also meant that we needed to develop a lock-on system

659
00:30:35,505 --> 00:30:36,886
late into the project that could work,

660
00:30:37,487 --> 00:30:39,048
even if the game wasn't designed around it.

661
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:41,670
And many players might have experienced frustrations

662
00:30:41,910 --> 00:30:43,971
with using the system for this very reason.

663
00:30:47,223 --> 00:30:49,424
We used our already existing melee target

664
00:30:49,644 --> 00:30:53,545
as the initial locked target when the lock-on system became

665
00:30:53,585 --> 00:30:55,786
engaged, so the transition would be smooth.

666
00:30:56,847 --> 00:30:58,547
The right stick could be flicked in a direction

667
00:30:58,567 --> 00:31:00,428
to change the target selection in screen space,

668
00:31:00,968 --> 00:31:02,709
as opposed to cycling through an ordered list,

669
00:31:03,149 --> 00:31:04,410
to make it a bit more intuitive when

670
00:31:04,450 --> 00:31:05,350
fighting multiple enemies.

671
00:31:06,845 --> 00:31:09,526
we decided to allow players to adjust the camera's elevation

672
00:31:10,086 --> 00:31:11,547
even when they were locked onto a target,

673
00:31:11,767 --> 00:31:13,327
unlike most implementations of the feature,

674
00:31:13,887 --> 00:31:15,908
so they could still see elevated points of interest,

675
00:31:16,288 --> 00:31:17,449
or even just take in the environment

676
00:31:17,669 --> 00:31:18,549
without losing their target.

677
00:31:21,230 --> 00:31:23,450
One particularly interesting feature we added to lock on

678
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:24,691
happens when you pull aim.

679
00:31:25,751 --> 00:31:27,372
We allow you to aim around freely,

680
00:31:27,652 --> 00:31:29,032
but retain your lock on target,

681
00:31:29,392 --> 00:31:31,493
so you'll return to it when the aim button is released.

682
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:34,059
Keeping with the goal of supporting fights

683
00:31:34,099 --> 00:31:36,180
with multiple enemies, this feature

684
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:38,301
allows players to handle two enemies at once,

685
00:31:38,501 --> 00:31:41,082
even when using lock-on, as they could focus primarily

686
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:43,123
on their locked-on target and occasionally throw

687
00:31:43,143 --> 00:31:43,823
their axe at the other.

688
00:31:47,745 --> 00:31:49,666
Now that we've covered systems that help players track

689
00:31:49,766 --> 00:31:51,607
and target their enemies, let's focus

690
00:31:51,647 --> 00:31:53,548
on those which help players to continue to combat them

691
00:31:54,148 --> 00:31:55,328
once they had already been engaged.

692
00:31:58,075 --> 00:31:59,856
To better understand this, let's take a minute

693
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:01,436
to talk about animation translation

694
00:32:01,697 --> 00:32:03,878
and how it affects engaging enemies in combat.

695
00:32:04,998 --> 00:32:06,299
I mentioned during the introduction

696
00:32:06,499 --> 00:32:08,960
that having exaggerated and fun enemy hit reactions,

697
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,361
as well as strong attacks for Kratos,

698
00:32:11,441 --> 00:32:12,962
which move him forward through the space,

699
00:32:13,342 --> 00:32:15,503
were both integral to our combat system's identity.

700
00:32:16,444 --> 00:32:18,585
These two concepts play into each other

701
00:32:18,865 --> 00:32:20,186
due to animation translation.

702
00:32:21,446 --> 00:32:24,428
God of War enemies translate backwards substantially

703
00:32:24,488 --> 00:32:25,368
during hit reactions.

704
00:32:26,420 --> 00:32:29,483
As a result, Kratos is always moving forward to keep up.

705
00:32:30,424 --> 00:32:33,567
Eventually, Kratos and the enemy keep moving in one direction

706
00:32:34,187 --> 00:32:36,589
and cover a large distance over the course of a combo.

707
00:32:39,152 --> 00:32:41,534
One problem is that animation translation like this

708
00:32:41,594 --> 00:32:43,335
was challenging with the new camera.

709
00:32:44,056 --> 00:32:46,478
It's easy to knock enemies off screen to the left

710
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:47,099
or to the right.

711
00:32:47,759 --> 00:32:49,421
And zooming forward through the world

712
00:32:49,561 --> 00:32:52,904
is disorienting as you see the environment pass rapidly by you.

713
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:55,754
There's also the fundamental issue

714
00:32:55,794 --> 00:32:58,255
that in this perspective, moving forward

715
00:32:58,535 --> 00:33:00,737
is naturally disadvantageous, since you

716
00:33:00,777 --> 00:33:03,018
are reducing the amount that you can see of your surroundings.

717
00:33:04,779 --> 00:33:06,860
On the other hand, moving backwards

718
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:09,862
is naturally advantageous, as it allows you to see more.

719
00:33:10,382 --> 00:33:12,383
And it's one of the reasons why players are naturally

720
00:33:12,423 --> 00:33:14,825
drawn to kiting or defensive gameplay patterns

721
00:33:14,945 --> 00:33:15,785
with this close camera.

722
00:33:17,444 --> 00:33:19,966
We had to be careful with how we balanced forward movement

723
00:33:20,046 --> 00:33:22,709
of Kratos' attacks, which really helped them deliver

724
00:33:22,729 --> 00:33:25,951
their power and satisfaction, with the disadvantageous state

725
00:33:26,051 --> 00:33:27,493
that they often put the player in.

726
00:33:30,395 --> 00:33:31,996
Because of this, we had to revisit

727
00:33:32,056 --> 00:33:34,799
how we author translation in many of our animations.

728
00:33:36,420 --> 00:33:39,643
We reduced the translation of basic enemy hit reactions

729
00:33:39,743 --> 00:33:41,745
substantially from how they were made in the past,

730
00:33:42,185 --> 00:33:44,767
and even reduced the translation of some of Kratos' attacks.

731
00:33:47,090 --> 00:33:48,851
But this actually worked out pretty well,

732
00:33:49,091 --> 00:33:50,652
since Suck to Target could still allow

733
00:33:50,712 --> 00:33:52,512
him to reach enemies with his attacks,

734
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:54,173
and it also provided enough movement

735
00:33:54,453 --> 00:33:56,134
to give the satisfying oomph we needed.

736
00:33:57,174 --> 00:33:58,875
But he wouldn't go zooming across the screen

737
00:33:59,195 --> 00:34:00,175
in an empty room anymore.

738
00:34:02,997 --> 00:34:05,718
Playing around with all of this took a lot of trial and error.

739
00:34:06,038 --> 00:34:07,919
And having the functionality in our design scripts

740
00:34:07,959 --> 00:34:10,419
to procedurally scale the translation of animations

741
00:34:10,860 --> 00:34:12,840
was incredibly helpful for testing outcomes

742
00:34:13,001 --> 00:34:14,001
with fast iteration speed.

743
00:34:17,094 --> 00:34:20,048
This video shows the problem of highly translating reactions,

744
00:34:20,349 --> 00:34:21,635
causing enemies to go off screen.

745
00:34:22,703 --> 00:34:27,606
The reactions themselves are fun and satisfying, but it's extremely frustrating to not be able

746
00:34:27,626 --> 00:34:32,629
to follow up on your target, with the added insult of having your target switched involuntarily

747
00:34:32,729 --> 00:34:34,490
back to another on-screen enemy.

748
00:34:35,231 --> 00:34:39,473
And even worse, the enemy that you just beat up is sure to return as an off-screen threat

749
00:34:39,493 --> 00:34:40,174
in a few seconds.

750
00:34:41,114 --> 00:34:45,457
Let me make this clear, we were punishing you for attacking with your combos and causing

751
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:46,838
fun enemy hit reactions.

752
00:34:47,398 --> 00:34:50,060
And that's the exact opposite of what our combat should be about.

753
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:55,435
All right, time to talk about one of my favorite features

754
00:34:55,815 --> 00:34:57,796
that we called Strike Assist and how

755
00:34:57,836 --> 00:34:58,656
it helps solve this problem.

756
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:04,978
In a stroke of pure brilliance, our then lead gameplay designer

757
00:35:05,298 --> 00:35:07,098
asked the profound question, what

758
00:35:07,138 --> 00:35:09,999
if we just kept enemies that were hit on screen?

759
00:35:11,140 --> 00:35:13,280
Seriously, check out Jason's taking an axe to God of War

760
00:35:13,300 --> 00:35:15,281
gameplay talk when it comes online.

761
00:35:17,301 --> 00:35:19,482
There's even an OG God of War trophy named after him, right?

762
00:35:20,402 --> 00:35:22,923
Anyway, after a bit of back and forth,

763
00:35:23,263 --> 00:35:25,725
G and his programming team came up with something really cool.

764
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,187
And it looks something like this.

765
00:35:30,768 --> 00:35:33,049
With strike assist, and bear with me for a second,

766
00:35:34,090 --> 00:35:36,311
attacks cause their victim to snap

767
00:35:36,451 --> 00:35:38,993
to an initial orientation at the beginning of their hit

768
00:35:39,013 --> 00:35:42,215
reaction, such that their adjusted trajectory will now

769
00:35:42,315 --> 00:35:45,056
go towards a blend between the camera's facing vector

770
00:35:45,396 --> 00:35:46,537
and their original trajectory.

771
00:35:47,831 --> 00:35:48,931
And if all that was too confusing,

772
00:35:49,291 --> 00:35:50,812
all that means is that enemies are now

773
00:35:51,012 --> 00:35:53,793
pulled onto the screen if they were going to go off of it.

774
00:35:54,393 --> 00:35:56,334
The larger the delta, the larger the correction.

775
00:35:57,574 --> 00:35:59,535
Each attack can specify its own blend.

776
00:35:59,995 --> 00:36:02,476
So some attacks can say, make the enemy go right

777
00:36:02,516 --> 00:36:03,436
to the center of the camera.

778
00:36:04,016 --> 00:36:06,657
Or just pull it close enough so that it stays on screen.

779
00:36:07,917 --> 00:36:10,378
Naturally, the farther the translation of the reaction,

780
00:36:10,718 --> 00:36:12,119
the more you'd see the effects of this.

781
00:36:13,299 --> 00:36:14,900
There's a lot of complexity to this feature

782
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,600
and how it was used.

783
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:17,320
But that's kind of the basic overview.

784
00:36:20,926 --> 00:36:24,089
With Strike Assist, enemies stopped being hit off screen.

785
00:36:24,890 --> 00:36:27,412
Successive attacks in a combo on the same target

786
00:36:27,452 --> 00:36:29,994
would pull it more and more into the center of the camera.

787
00:36:30,815 --> 00:36:33,357
And since, if you remember, Kratos rotates

788
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,959
to face his target when he attacks,

789
00:36:35,679 --> 00:36:38,061
this eventually led to both Kratos and his target

790
00:36:38,342 --> 00:36:40,744
translating back down the camera's direction,

791
00:36:41,444 --> 00:36:42,385
which was great for framing.

792
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:46,469
As a bonus, this made switching between melee attacks

793
00:36:46,629 --> 00:36:47,830
and range targeting easier.

794
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:51,173
as zoom snapping worked better if the enemy was already

795
00:36:51,213 --> 00:36:52,994
near the reticle, which is, of course,

796
00:36:53,154 --> 00:36:53,974
at the center of the screen.

797
00:36:56,396 --> 00:36:59,318
This feature led to a bunch of other new discoveries as well.

798
00:37:00,378 --> 00:37:02,720
See, players have control of the camera,

799
00:37:03,260 --> 00:37:05,841
so they could use this to aim where they wanted

800
00:37:05,862 --> 00:37:06,982
their enemies to be hit.

801
00:37:08,176 --> 00:37:10,119
To be clear, this was huge.

802
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:13,045
Building up combat systems with this new camera

803
00:37:13,345 --> 00:37:15,829
had led to a new type of moment-to-moment gameplay

804
00:37:16,150 --> 00:37:18,294
and expression of player intent and skill.

805
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,826
For example, strategies such as intentionally herding enemies

806
00:37:22,866 --> 00:37:25,247
together before pulling off a massive runic slam attack,

807
00:37:25,707 --> 00:37:27,468
or moving the camera to direct an enemy

808
00:37:27,548 --> 00:37:29,548
to fly off the side of a cliff with the last hit

809
00:37:29,568 --> 00:37:31,109
of your combo were now possible.

810
00:37:31,809 --> 00:37:33,810
And it was so intuitive through just looking

811
00:37:33,850 --> 00:37:37,351
at what you wanted to do that most players had no idea

812
00:37:37,371 --> 00:37:38,711
that this was even happening at all.

813
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:42,652
Strike assist may have possibly been the most important aspect

814
00:37:42,752 --> 00:37:44,433
in making the new combat system come together,

815
00:37:44,453 --> 00:37:46,173
and it was a huge victory for the team.

816
00:37:49,627 --> 00:37:52,168
Apart from Strike Assist, we used a few other tricks

817
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:53,548
to help players engage their enemies

818
00:37:53,908 --> 00:37:55,749
by allowing them to keep up the offense

819
00:37:55,889 --> 00:37:57,729
while enemies were already playing hit reactions.

820
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,650
Many of the hit reactions themselves

821
00:38:00,750 --> 00:38:03,231
would fire invisible collisions, allowing enemies

822
00:38:03,271 --> 00:38:06,092
to bump into each other and even hit enemies to their sides,

823
00:38:06,392 --> 00:38:08,652
despite there sometimes being no visual contact.

824
00:38:09,673 --> 00:38:11,813
This rewarded players by helping them stay safe,

825
00:38:12,314 --> 00:38:14,934
since enemies who were bumped were sure not to attack

826
00:38:15,094 --> 00:38:16,555
until after they had recovered.

827
00:38:20,647 --> 00:38:22,547
Another trick was disrupting enemy aggression.

828
00:38:23,488 --> 00:38:25,889
The closed camera naturally makes Kratos and his target

829
00:38:26,169 --> 00:38:28,470
take up a large part of the screen real estate

830
00:38:29,030 --> 00:38:30,170
and obstruct the player's vision.

831
00:38:31,231 --> 00:38:33,111
We realized that we would have to incentivize

832
00:38:33,452 --> 00:38:36,153
offensive gameplay even more if we wanted players

833
00:38:36,213 --> 00:38:38,734
to feel confident despite being able to see less.

834
00:38:39,934 --> 00:38:41,014
Remember the aggression system,

835
00:38:41,275 --> 00:38:43,215
the topic I covered earlier about how we choose

836
00:38:43,255 --> 00:38:44,516
which enemies are active threats?

837
00:38:45,956 --> 00:38:47,777
We made some simple tweaks to it to handle this.

838
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:51,238
If an attacking aggressive enemy gets interrupted

839
00:38:51,538 --> 00:38:55,061
and plays a hit reaction, it retains its aggressive tokens

840
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:57,823
temporarily instead of relinquishing them immediately

841
00:38:57,903 --> 00:38:58,703
for others to use.

842
00:39:00,785 --> 00:39:02,886
For a short period of time, that enemy

843
00:39:02,906 --> 00:39:04,928
would block other non-aggressive enemies

844
00:39:05,228 --> 00:39:08,250
from taking these tokens, but couldn't do an attack itself

845
00:39:08,390 --> 00:39:10,012
since it was already in a hit reaction.

846
00:39:10,612 --> 00:39:14,054
And basically, that effectively gave the player a power play

847
00:39:14,575 --> 00:39:15,996
every time they were being offensive.

848
00:39:17,262 --> 00:39:20,805
If they extended their offense for too long without worrying about other threats, they

849
00:39:20,825 --> 00:39:23,888
could be punished, but for a window of time they'd have the advantage.

850
00:39:24,789 --> 00:39:29,373
In most scenarios on our normal difficulty, say against a pack of Draugr, only two enemies

851
00:39:29,393 --> 00:39:31,234
would be allowed to be aggressive at any one time.

852
00:39:32,315 --> 00:39:36,759
This meant that the player just had to worry about one other enemy apart from the one Kratos

853
00:39:36,799 --> 00:39:40,182
was already engaged with, which isn't all that bad to keep track of.

854
00:39:41,660 --> 00:39:44,882
Enemy air reactions specifically would prolong this effect for more time,

855
00:39:45,162 --> 00:39:47,403
giving you yet another bonus to keep your combos going,

856
00:39:47,643 --> 00:39:48,764
despite the threats around you.

857
00:39:49,584 --> 00:39:50,044
Speaking of,

858
00:39:52,085 --> 00:39:55,206
at first, we didn't have enemies getting launched or juggled in the air

859
00:39:55,326 --> 00:39:56,427
due to the new grounded tone.

860
00:39:57,307 --> 00:40:00,989
However, juggling enemies is part of the playing with your food identity

861
00:40:01,029 --> 00:40:01,889
we needed to retain,

862
00:40:02,370 --> 00:40:05,311
so we had to solve juggling for our new combat system in close camera.

863
00:40:06,598 --> 00:40:09,860
The largest issue is that enemies can now be constantly hit upwards

864
00:40:10,140 --> 00:40:12,642
until they are above the camera and you can't see them anymore.

865
00:40:13,502 --> 00:40:16,884
Not to mention, the Leviathan Axe had limited melee attack range.

866
00:40:17,424 --> 00:40:19,985
And since we removed the jump button from this entry in the series,

867
00:40:20,405 --> 00:40:23,607
there would be no way for players to stay engaged on a target like that.

868
00:40:24,587 --> 00:40:28,509
To make matters worse, juggled enemies took up a lot of real estate on the screen

869
00:40:28,910 --> 00:40:32,632
and included nearby threats, so players rarely felt safe while attacking them.

870
00:40:38,030 --> 00:40:40,591
To tackle the first problem of enemies exiting the camera

871
00:40:40,611 --> 00:40:43,112
frame, we implemented a float height system,

872
00:40:43,392 --> 00:40:46,053
which could be used to tell an enemy how high it was allowed

873
00:40:46,093 --> 00:40:47,353
to go relative to Kratos.

874
00:40:49,054 --> 00:40:50,814
If the root joint of the enemy ever

875
00:40:50,874 --> 00:40:52,535
went higher than the specified float height,

876
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,456
some correction velocity would be applied to keep it in bounds.

877
00:40:56,056 --> 00:40:57,837
And this could be tuned per enemy hit reaction

878
00:40:58,097 --> 00:40:59,017
by designers in script.

879
00:41:00,538 --> 00:41:02,638
We tried to make this look as natural as possible,

880
00:41:02,938 --> 00:41:04,679
while still keeping enemies low enough

881
00:41:04,839 --> 00:41:06,880
where they were in range of the axe's melee attacks.

882
00:41:08,057 --> 00:41:09,738
It's worth noting that to get this feeling right,

883
00:41:10,118 --> 00:41:12,179
we actually had to animate the characters falling

884
00:41:12,499 --> 00:41:14,359
instead of relying on gravity or physics,

885
00:41:14,900 --> 00:41:16,640
since the trick was that the bounce of juggling

886
00:41:16,900 --> 00:41:18,101
always had to feel good.

887
00:41:21,802 --> 00:41:24,343
Enemy air reactions also warranted the same technique

888
00:41:24,383 --> 00:41:25,543
we used on ground reactions

889
00:41:25,923 --> 00:41:27,664
by having invisible impact collisions

890
00:41:27,724 --> 00:41:29,084
that hit other nearby enemies,

891
00:41:30,105 --> 00:41:32,245
except we made them much, much larger

892
00:41:32,286 --> 00:41:33,326
than their grounded counterparts.

893
00:41:35,600 --> 00:41:38,121
Enemies who could fire range projectiles from afar, however,

894
00:41:38,421 --> 00:41:39,422
were still always a threat.

895
00:41:39,742 --> 00:41:41,943
So players still had to be smart about when they should

896
00:41:42,303 --> 00:41:44,324
and when they shouldn't juggle an airborne target.

897
00:41:50,906 --> 00:41:53,687
So after the long journey of development,

898
00:41:54,247 --> 00:41:55,808
what did this process yield for us in the end?

899
00:41:56,988 --> 00:41:58,629
Was it possible to make a combat system

900
00:41:58,769 --> 00:42:00,249
within a close and intimate camera

901
00:42:00,770 --> 00:42:02,610
feel like an honest evolution of God of War?

902
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:08,238
Not all players might have shared the same experience,

903
00:42:08,458 --> 00:42:10,640
and there is still much room to grow in all the aspects

904
00:42:10,660 --> 00:42:11,440
I've covered in this talk.

905
00:42:12,141 --> 00:42:14,923
But by and large, it was rewarding to see most players

906
00:42:14,963 --> 00:42:17,685
engage in our combat in an offensive and confident manner,

907
00:42:18,106 --> 00:42:20,348
despite the many issues posed by the new camera.

908
00:42:21,489 --> 00:42:23,811
By keeping our combat identity at the forefront

909
00:42:23,831 --> 00:42:26,293
of all of our systems for tracking, targeting,

910
00:42:26,713 --> 00:42:29,916
and engaging enemies, we were able to work towards gameplay

911
00:42:30,016 --> 00:42:31,557
that felt satisfyingly familiar,

912
00:42:31,857 --> 00:42:33,258
yet fresh from a new perspective.

913
00:42:34,232 --> 00:42:36,914
The result was a more deliberate and unflinching God of War

914
00:42:36,954 --> 00:42:39,676
combat experience that felt authentic to the franchise's

915
00:42:39,716 --> 00:42:40,076
legacy.

916
00:42:41,418 --> 00:42:43,159
And this line of thinking and problem solving,

917
00:42:43,479 --> 00:42:45,801
in terms of breaking down your gameplay's identity

918
00:42:46,081 --> 00:42:48,503
and keeping it in mind at all times during development,

919
00:42:48,864 --> 00:42:51,706
can apply to other IPs in any genre, which are similarly

920
00:42:51,726 --> 00:42:53,948
going through a challenging reboot or reimagining.

921
00:42:56,450 --> 00:42:59,713
Reaching our results took a very, very long time

922
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:03,116
of more than three years of constant iteration and testing.

923
00:43:04,022 --> 00:43:05,863
And this was a crucially joint problem

924
00:43:05,903 --> 00:43:08,164
between our gameplay design and programming departments

925
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:10,184
and involved many talented people.

926
00:43:11,085 --> 00:43:12,885
We needed designers deeply involved

927
00:43:12,905 --> 00:43:14,226
with the technical implementation

928
00:43:14,746 --> 00:43:17,007
and programmers invested in the design context

929
00:43:17,067 --> 00:43:17,947
and player experience.

930
00:43:18,687 --> 00:43:20,608
And this was true for both on the ground work

931
00:43:20,828 --> 00:43:22,448
as well as department leadership.

932
00:43:23,609 --> 00:43:25,169
As a result, these two departments

933
00:43:25,209 --> 00:43:26,670
work very closely with each other,

934
00:43:27,090 --> 00:43:28,370
both in terms of feature development

935
00:43:28,670 --> 00:43:29,931
and proximity at our studio.

936
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,061
Finally, the closed camera seemed counterintuitive

937
00:43:36,081 --> 00:43:39,042
to almost all aspects of God of War style melee combat.

938
00:43:39,862 --> 00:43:41,723
When traditionally good design principles

939
00:43:41,763 --> 00:43:44,764
conflicted with vision, the team took a difficult risk

940
00:43:44,844 --> 00:43:45,765
and committed to the latter.

941
00:43:46,625 --> 00:43:48,786
The process was challenging, and there was a lot of doubt

942
00:43:48,806 --> 00:43:49,506
throughout development.

943
00:43:50,487 --> 00:43:52,308
But it was what the game needed to shine as a whole,

944
00:43:52,988 --> 00:43:55,349
what combat needed to evolve in a bold new direction,

945
00:43:55,849 --> 00:43:58,530
and at the end of the day, it's what made the journey absolutely

946
00:43:58,550 --> 00:43:58,810
worth it.

947
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:02,066
And that's the talk.

948
00:44:02,407 --> 00:44:04,108
If you're excited by anything I've gone through today

949
00:44:04,368 --> 00:44:06,009
and would like to join us on our next journey,

950
00:44:06,269 --> 00:44:07,010
please get in touch.

951
00:44:07,470 --> 00:44:08,971
We're hiring across many departments,

952
00:44:09,072 --> 00:44:11,093
including combat design and gameplay programming,

953
00:44:11,393 --> 00:44:12,334
and we'd love to hear from you.

954
00:44:13,875 --> 00:44:14,396
Thanks so much.

955
00:44:14,536 --> 00:44:15,096
It was a pleasure.

956
00:44:15,116 --> 00:44:28,326
And now, Jeet and I can open it up to questions.

957
00:44:31,907 --> 00:44:33,188
Man, these are bright lights.

958
00:44:33,408 --> 00:44:37,891
Yeah.

959
00:44:38,771 --> 00:44:39,471
Thanks for the talk.

960
00:44:40,192 --> 00:44:42,873
I noticed in the Valkyrie fights, a lot of your

961
00:44:43,334 --> 00:44:45,675
priorities are opposite.

962
00:44:45,715 --> 00:44:48,096
Like offensive is usually punished.

963
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:52,795
They love being off screen, so what was the process there?

964
00:44:53,356 --> 00:44:54,557
Sure, I can talk a bit about that.

965
00:44:54,597 --> 00:44:57,941
So the Valkyrie fights are kind of like the most challenging

966
00:44:58,041 --> 00:45:00,764
combat encounters, and they're all, apart from one,

967
00:45:01,785 --> 00:45:02,686
one-v-one encounters.

968
00:45:03,086 --> 00:45:04,788
So because those are testing mastery,

969
00:45:05,829 --> 00:45:09,370
camera control is actually part of the mastery that we're testing in those fights.

970
00:45:09,890 --> 00:45:13,351
A lot of the core fights that you're doing throughout the game with, let's say, Draugr,

971
00:45:13,852 --> 00:45:17,593
it's really just like getting in there and fulfilling that traditional God of War fantasy.

972
00:45:18,093 --> 00:45:22,294
But with the Valkyries, it's like we want to test your mastery of your combat suite

973
00:45:22,374 --> 00:45:23,855
as well as the control of your camera.

974
00:45:24,615 --> 00:45:27,156
And so that's kind of with regards to the second part of your question.

975
00:45:27,576 --> 00:45:28,136
For the first...

976
00:45:29,697 --> 00:45:31,778
And this is true also in past God of War games,

977
00:45:31,838 --> 00:45:33,679
that that kind of punching bag feeling

978
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:36,081
of playing with your food doesn't necessarily extend

979
00:45:36,181 --> 00:45:37,622
to all enemies in the cast.

980
00:45:37,943 --> 00:45:39,103
It's really what we focus on,

981
00:45:39,203 --> 00:45:41,085
what we call like the grunt class of characters.

982
00:45:41,625 --> 00:45:43,066
And other characters that are beyond that,

983
00:45:43,106 --> 00:45:45,328
that are less kind of like playing with your food,

984
00:45:45,688 --> 00:45:47,409
the fun comes more from the challenge

985
00:45:47,469 --> 00:45:49,030
and the kind of pattern of play that they provide.

986
00:45:49,671 --> 00:45:49,931
Thank you.

987
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:52,193
Yep.

988
00:45:53,213 --> 00:45:55,175
Hey, really great talk, thank you very much.

989
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:59,824
So we heard a lot of good stuff about the new weapon, the Leviathan Axe.

990
00:46:00,324 --> 00:46:03,226
I'm curious about everyone's favorite, the Blades of Chaos.

991
00:46:03,866 --> 00:46:06,308
Did that have to get reinvented much for this,

992
00:46:06,368 --> 00:46:10,311
and did it affect some of the gameplay new features that you talked about?

993
00:46:10,973 --> 00:46:15,899
Sure, so the question is, you talked about the Leviathan Axe, but what about the Blades of Chaos?

994
00:46:16,940 --> 00:46:21,065
For this game, and yes, it had to get re-looked at a lot.

995
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:27,313
I don't actually cover that in this talk, but for a long time, the attacks with the blades in-game,

996
00:46:27,373 --> 00:46:29,095
we wanted to shift that up from the different camera.

997
00:46:29,615 --> 00:46:32,617
And they actually had the blades in hand the entire time

998
00:46:32,877 --> 00:46:34,118
and not actually swinging out.

999
00:46:34,638 --> 00:46:36,459
So you unlock them later in the tree,

1000
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:37,859
but the delay attacks where you're just

1001
00:46:37,879 --> 00:46:39,240
swiping with the blades in hand, that

1002
00:46:39,360 --> 00:46:42,221
used to be the core kind of base combo with the blades

1003
00:46:42,922 --> 00:46:44,883
because it kind of played better with the camera.

1004
00:46:45,583 --> 00:46:47,904
But after we messed around with it for a bit, we were like,

1005
00:46:48,064 --> 00:46:49,825
all right, this doesn't feel like the blades, right?

1006
00:46:49,925 --> 00:46:52,486
So we kind of swapped that and kept the original moveset

1007
00:46:53,227 --> 00:46:54,367
on the camera.

1008
00:46:54,507 --> 00:46:57,108
But a lot of the systems that we have actually extended.

1009
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:59,069
once we had made them work with the axe,

1010
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,610
they actually extended to the blades.

1011
00:47:00,790 --> 00:47:02,811
There's a bit of tuning and differences that we do,

1012
00:47:03,031 --> 00:47:04,991
but we were able to reuse a lot of it.

1013
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:08,553
Yeah, and so just from a sort of technical point of view,

1014
00:47:09,133 --> 00:47:11,754
compared to the old God of War blades,

1015
00:47:12,494 --> 00:47:14,695
the new blades had to be completely redone for this project.

1016
00:47:16,956 --> 00:47:17,976
Looks beautiful, by the way.

1017
00:47:18,156 --> 00:47:18,576
Great work.

1018
00:47:18,856 --> 00:47:19,017
Thanks.

1019
00:47:21,397 --> 00:47:28,486
Hi, I was wondering if you guys did any sort of partial rendered or not rendered kind of

1020
00:47:28,806 --> 00:47:33,212
definition for larger enemies to determine whether or not they were on screen or slightly

1021
00:47:33,352 --> 00:47:36,316
off screen in terms of the targeting and things like that.

1022
00:47:39,560 --> 00:47:41,482
So a lot of the targeting stuff is done.

1023
00:47:41,642 --> 00:47:42,983
We have, I mentioned in the talk,

1024
00:47:43,003 --> 00:47:44,705
but there's like a root joint on every character, right?

1025
00:47:46,126 --> 00:47:47,647
And so a lot of the times, systems

1026
00:47:47,687 --> 00:47:49,529
are doing a pretty naive check in terms of,

1027
00:47:49,649 --> 00:47:51,771
is the root joint kind of on screen?

1028
00:47:52,091 --> 00:47:53,532
We do have a rendering check as well.

1029
00:47:54,113 --> 00:47:55,614
Different systems use different checks.

1030
00:47:55,994 --> 00:47:58,696
And actually, for positioning, I didn't get into this

1031
00:47:58,736 --> 00:48:00,497
in the talk, but we don't actually,

1032
00:48:00,797 --> 00:48:02,458
when I say enemies are on screen or off screen,

1033
00:48:02,758 --> 00:48:04,159
it's more that are they in a frustum

1034
00:48:04,179 --> 00:48:06,220
in front of Kratos' facing direction?

1035
00:48:06,940 --> 00:48:08,862
Because the camera moves so much

1036
00:48:09,102 --> 00:48:12,444
that often you would invalidate the checks instantly.

1037
00:48:13,244 --> 00:48:14,005
So it's a good question,

1038
00:48:14,045 --> 00:48:15,866
because it's actually pretty nuanced.

1039
00:48:16,186 --> 00:48:18,187
Checking whether an enemy is on screen or off screen,

1040
00:48:18,647 --> 00:48:20,388
I think there's three different things that we do

1041
00:48:20,468 --> 00:48:22,229
to check that, depending on the system.

1042
00:48:22,690 --> 00:48:22,950
Thank you.

1043
00:48:22,990 --> 00:48:27,534
And I think different systems need different ideas

1044
00:48:27,554 --> 00:48:28,694
of what on-screen really means.

1045
00:48:28,734 --> 00:48:29,735
Like for positioning, you're going

1046
00:48:29,755 --> 00:48:30,736
to want to do something different.

1047
00:48:31,176 --> 00:48:34,599
And then like Mihir mentioned with the camera strafe assist,

1048
00:48:35,099 --> 00:48:36,741
that required a completely new version

1049
00:48:36,781 --> 00:48:38,022
of what on-screen really meant.

1050
00:48:38,182 --> 00:48:40,944
So I think it is about trying to make sure

1051
00:48:41,004 --> 00:48:43,226
the solution applies to the type of problem you're solving.

1052
00:48:43,606 --> 00:48:44,146
All right, thank you.

1053
00:48:46,815 --> 00:48:50,178
Hi, I'm wondering from a production standpoint

1054
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:53,062
how you guys may prioritize what you feel

1055
00:48:53,122 --> 00:48:54,924
is important in combat, right?

1056
00:48:55,344 --> 00:48:57,527
Is it like some guy's running into a room

1057
00:48:57,547 --> 00:48:58,988
and he's like, I want to be able to kill

1058
00:48:59,329 --> 00:49:01,091
10 Draugr in 10 seconds.

1059
00:49:01,151 --> 00:49:03,974
Like how do you deal with that

1060
00:49:04,314 --> 00:49:05,716
when there's different enemy types?

1061
00:49:05,736 --> 00:49:08,058
Like where do you guys pull that inspiration from?

1062
00:49:08,832 --> 00:49:10,534
Sure, that's a really good question.

1063
00:49:11,696 --> 00:49:15,780
So at our studio, we have the benefit of a lineage of

1064
00:49:15,860 --> 00:49:17,662
working on these kind of melee action games.

1065
00:49:18,083 --> 00:49:21,046
And so in a lot of directorial and lead positions, we have

1066
00:49:21,086 --> 00:49:23,008
people that have gone through.

1067
00:49:24,189 --> 00:49:26,750
Many people have been there from God of War 1, right,

1068
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:27,710
that are still in the studio.

1069
00:49:28,171 --> 00:49:29,691
And so because of that, there's a bit of a history

1070
00:49:29,791 --> 00:49:31,532
and a philosophy to how we design.

1071
00:49:32,072 --> 00:49:35,093
And the first thing on combat is that in a test room,

1072
00:49:35,573 --> 00:49:37,914
you know, with one enemy who isn't fighting back,

1073
00:49:38,494 --> 00:49:39,294
that should be a blast.

1074
00:49:39,914 --> 00:49:41,995
Like, it should just be fun to beat up that character

1075
00:49:42,295 --> 00:49:44,536
and nothing else matters until we, you know,

1076
00:49:44,556 --> 00:49:45,176
we haven't reached that.

1077
00:49:45,616 --> 00:49:46,737
And that was true on the project.

1078
00:49:46,777 --> 00:49:49,858
I mean, we didn't have that for a long time on this game.

1079
00:49:50,536 --> 00:49:53,081
And that was very frustrating because people would be wondering about, you know,

1080
00:49:53,121 --> 00:49:55,204
hey, the rest of the enemy cast, like, why aren't we building that?

1081
00:49:55,345 --> 00:49:56,787
It's like, well, the Draugr isn't fun to hit.

1082
00:49:57,469 --> 00:50:00,935
So, why even bother doing all this other stuff if that's not going to be good, right?

1083
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:07,093
Yeah, I think he pointed out the fact that we focus on the basics first,

1084
00:50:07,133 --> 00:50:08,674
get your core working really well,

1085
00:50:08,694 --> 00:50:12,655
and then in parallel, start to look at the finesse stuff.

1086
00:50:12,795 --> 00:50:15,136
So, like he mentioned, for a long time,

1087
00:50:15,176 --> 00:50:16,677
we were just trying to get the basic attacks

1088
00:50:16,737 --> 00:50:18,858
and the basic sort of Draugr core loop working well,

1089
00:50:18,878 --> 00:50:21,499
and then there was a moment in time when we decided,

1090
00:50:21,779 --> 00:50:23,139
even from a production point of view,

1091
00:50:23,559 --> 00:50:26,681
that we are going to now start really focusing on combat feel.

1092
00:50:27,261 --> 00:50:29,522
And that's kind of where a lot of these ideas came from.

1093
00:50:29,582 --> 00:50:34,343
So this is where Jason and I would sit down and play the game a lot

1094
00:50:34,403 --> 00:50:37,084
and really try to break down feel issues.

1095
00:50:37,685 --> 00:50:40,766
And at the same time, we were starting to do heavy play testing as well.

1096
00:50:41,206 --> 00:50:46,107
So having very, very scrutinized breakdowns of reviews

1097
00:50:46,428 --> 00:50:48,208
just strictly around combat feel.

1098
00:50:48,949 --> 00:50:53,011
play testing heavily and then sort of also the design team doing a lot of internal reviews

1099
00:50:53,471 --> 00:50:57,834
sort of gave us a really good perspective of what should be prioritized and what are

1100
00:50:57,854 --> 00:50:59,035
the next steps that we're going to take.

1101
00:50:59,855 --> 00:51:00,356
Thank you guys.

1102
00:51:02,668 --> 00:51:05,110
Hi, thank you so much for your talk, it was very cool.

1103
00:51:05,510 --> 00:51:07,652
My question is more on like,

1104
00:51:07,732 --> 00:51:11,414
how do you handle ranged attacks or ranged enemies?

1105
00:51:11,434 --> 00:51:13,856
Did you use the same system in terms of positioning?

1106
00:51:14,277 --> 00:51:17,239
And how much did level design play into this,

1107
00:51:18,940 --> 00:51:20,742
into the combat design and vice versa?

1108
00:51:21,162 --> 00:51:21,322
Sure.

1109
00:51:22,923 --> 00:51:23,804
The second part of your question,

1110
00:51:23,904 --> 00:51:25,665
are you talking specifically for ranged enemies

1111
00:51:25,805 --> 00:51:26,526
or just in general?

1112
00:51:26,726 --> 00:51:27,106
In general.

1113
00:51:27,306 --> 00:51:29,508
Okay, so the first part of your question,

1114
00:51:31,433 --> 00:51:35,277
Pretty much every enemy uses the same fight positioning system that we have,

1115
00:51:36,018 --> 00:51:39,321
but the zone shapes can be changed depending on the enemy.

1116
00:51:39,822 --> 00:51:41,844
We do cheat a bit with some of the ranged enemies,

1117
00:51:41,964 --> 00:51:44,907
where we actually have a behavior that we just call turret mode internally,

1118
00:51:45,348 --> 00:51:46,949
and those are enemies that are stationary.

1119
00:51:46,989 --> 00:51:48,751
They just spawn in a position and they never move.

1120
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:52,014
So in some areas we're able to kind of pepper them around,

1121
00:51:52,074 --> 00:51:53,736
especially with a bit of verticality.

1122
00:51:55,264 --> 00:52:00,046
But otherwise, really, every enemy just follows the positioning system, even if they're ranged.

1123
00:52:00,987 --> 00:52:06,129
The aggressiveness system has some, takes that into account, so even enemies that are

1124
00:52:06,149 --> 00:52:09,191
in the back, if they're ranged, they're allowed to kind of like, you know, their attacks can

1125
00:52:09,211 --> 00:52:09,831
kind of seep through.

1126
00:52:11,112 --> 00:52:14,132
From the second part of your question, we actually have an encounters team

1127
00:52:14,653 --> 00:52:16,853
between the combat design and level design team.

1128
00:52:17,253 --> 00:52:20,374
And the encounters team, they're focused on what will the fights be,

1129
00:52:20,434 --> 00:52:21,594
what's the enemy composition.

1130
00:52:22,274 --> 00:52:24,435
They're kind of working very closely back and forth.

1131
00:52:25,035 --> 00:52:27,916
The exceptions are when we have boss fights.

1132
00:52:27,956 --> 00:52:29,816
That's kind of when combat designers and level designers

1133
00:52:29,956 --> 00:52:31,957
really work closely together on a specific feature.

1134
00:52:32,697 --> 00:52:33,217
Cool. Thank you.

1135
00:52:36,442 --> 00:52:37,602
Did you ever want to

1136
00:52:38,222 --> 00:52:45,464
Explore the area of giving players a rewarding way to attack an enemy that is off-camera or behind them

1137
00:52:48,325 --> 00:52:51,666
Figured so sorry the question was did we ever explore?

1138
00:52:52,627 --> 00:52:57,948
Giving players a rewarding way to handle off-screen enemies. Yeah, sure like I

1139
00:52:58,028 --> 00:52:58,949
think of like the

1140
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:02,090
enemies in Dark Souls who can fall backwards

1141
00:53:02,984 --> 00:53:08,409
Yeah, I mean, we tried allowing Kratos to start sort of attacking much white,

1142
00:53:08,529 --> 00:53:12,352
like getting outside of the main camera frustum.

1143
00:53:12,813 --> 00:53:16,476
And for the most part, like I would say the decision was more that it just didn't

1144
00:53:16,596 --> 00:53:19,919
look very good, even from a fidelity point of view, sort of having Kratos

1145
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:24,804
completely turn around and start angling, you know, laterally through the camera.

1146
00:53:25,524 --> 00:53:28,407
That was one of the main reasons I would say that we decided to avoid that.

1147
00:53:28,819 --> 00:53:32,881
Yeah, the other thing is that we tried a lot of iterations on the quick turn, so that was

1148
00:53:32,921 --> 00:53:35,362
like we had that in the game where you could just kind of quickly turn around.

1149
00:53:36,703 --> 00:53:40,024
And for a long time, we actually had a version of that that included an attack.

1150
00:53:40,244 --> 00:53:42,265
So you would do a quick turn around and attack an enemy.

1151
00:53:43,306 --> 00:53:44,927
But it felt kind of weird, right?

1152
00:53:44,947 --> 00:53:48,148
Because it kind of just auto, it did some auto seeking to find that target.

1153
00:53:48,508 --> 00:53:51,450
So if an enemy was here, you'd kind of like run around and then press the like button.

1154
00:53:51,870 --> 00:53:53,812
you know, it would automatically attack for you.

1155
00:53:54,733 --> 00:53:56,214
And that's not really a pattern of play

1156
00:53:56,234 --> 00:53:57,595
that we were trying to encourage.

1157
00:53:58,456 --> 00:54:00,797
So we doubled down on like, no,

1158
00:54:00,817 --> 00:54:02,218
like camera's a big part of this game

1159
00:54:02,379 --> 00:54:04,440
and part of learning the combat in this game

1160
00:54:04,500 --> 00:54:05,721
is learning how to use the camera.

1161
00:54:07,262 --> 00:54:07,543
Thanks.

1162
00:54:07,763 --> 00:54:11,726
Hi, you seem to have very clear objectives

1163
00:54:11,786 --> 00:54:14,428
of what you wanted to achieve with the combat,

1164
00:54:14,528 --> 00:54:16,229
even though you iterated on the techniques.

1165
00:54:16,790 --> 00:54:18,251
But how true was that?

1166
00:54:18,351 --> 00:54:20,653
Is it an artifact of hindsight in the speech?

1167
00:54:21,695 --> 00:54:25,214
How long do you take for you to please set clear your objectives?

1168
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:28,352
Yeah, so Jeet kind of alluded to this earlier,

1169
00:54:28,372 --> 00:54:29,452
and you might have more to say on this.

1170
00:54:29,873 --> 00:54:32,734
But for the first couple of years on this project,

1171
00:54:32,794 --> 00:54:35,776
there was so much that was new and changing.

1172
00:54:35,916 --> 00:54:37,737
And it was very hard to move forward

1173
00:54:37,757 --> 00:54:39,818
because we were questioning a lot of what we were doing.

1174
00:54:40,658 --> 00:54:43,020
But I said in there that in the fall of 2016,

1175
00:54:44,981 --> 00:54:47,202
so this is after we had done the E3 demo,

1176
00:54:47,342 --> 00:54:49,983
and people saw the vision and they liked it.

1177
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:51,924
We're like, oh man, we could do this.

1178
00:54:53,585 --> 00:54:55,186
But everything still doesn't feel very good.

1179
00:54:55,607 --> 00:54:57,788
And that's when we started to step back and do

1180
00:54:57,808 --> 00:54:59,609
these internal combat play tests on the team.

1181
00:55:01,030 --> 00:55:04,052
And that really, when we started getting a lot of data,

1182
00:55:04,072 --> 00:55:06,354
we were like, OK, this is interesting.

1183
00:55:06,674 --> 00:55:08,475
And that's when Jeet and Jason really

1184
00:55:08,716 --> 00:55:10,997
started meeting with Corey really frequently on being like,

1185
00:55:11,157 --> 00:55:12,398
no, let's break this down.

1186
00:55:12,418 --> 00:55:13,659
Let's actually come up with a strategy.

1187
00:55:13,979 --> 00:55:15,480
So obviously, in a GDC talk, I'm going

1188
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:17,461
to try to couple things together.

1189
00:55:17,481 --> 00:55:20,944
But the idea wasn't far off.

1190
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:22,185
It was a very targeted.

1191
00:55:23,171 --> 00:55:26,598
approach and like let's let's look at just targeting. What are we going to do about targeting?

1192
00:55:26,658 --> 00:55:31,108
Just get the intent right. Okay, what about juggled enemies? This air combat feels terrible,

1193
00:55:31,189 --> 00:55:33,794
you know, like it was looking at those different things and tackling them.

1194
00:55:34,565 --> 00:55:37,666
And to Tamir's point, I think maybe in terms of pillars,

1195
00:55:38,306 --> 00:55:40,907
I would say a lot of ideas kind of came back

1196
00:55:41,227 --> 00:55:43,528
given that we started getting more confident

1197
00:55:43,588 --> 00:55:45,749
in our ability to achieve and execute them.

1198
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:48,570
So for example, juggling, it was something that,

1199
00:55:48,990 --> 00:55:51,090
again, very much lines up with the idea

1200
00:55:51,110 --> 00:55:52,111
of play with your food.

1201
00:55:52,611 --> 00:55:56,692
But there was a lot of resistance to it maybe early on

1202
00:55:56,752 --> 00:55:57,052
because...

1203
00:55:58,095 --> 00:56:01,156
you know, we were still trying to just get the base stuff in a good place.

1204
00:56:01,256 --> 00:56:06,238
So I think the core tenants of kind of in the in the very first early slides

1205
00:56:06,278 --> 00:56:10,459
where we kind of here laid out like what is the vision of God of War combat as a whole?

1206
00:56:10,479 --> 00:56:14,560
I think that still stayed true pretty much like we knew that as

1207
00:56:14,760 --> 00:56:18,341
as being a fundamental kind of vision of what this would be.

1208
00:56:18,361 --> 00:56:20,901
It was more like, how do we really execute it?

1209
00:56:20,921 --> 00:56:23,082
How do we realize it under these new?

1210
00:56:24,583 --> 00:56:26,205
sort of in this new sort of framework.

1211
00:56:26,365 --> 00:56:29,067
And then finding our way through that was, you know,

1212
00:56:29,087 --> 00:56:31,149
practically kind of all the solutions that we came up with.

1213
00:56:31,790 --> 00:56:32,090
Thank you.

1214
00:56:33,872 --> 00:56:36,434
Hey guys, you guys briefly touched on it,

1215
00:56:36,554 --> 00:56:38,716
but how did all that kind of stuff change

1216
00:56:38,756 --> 00:56:39,717
on the harder difficulties,

1217
00:56:39,757 --> 00:56:41,259
like positioning and aggressiveness?

1218
00:56:41,979 --> 00:56:43,261
And how do you make that fair?

1219
00:56:43,501 --> 00:56:44,542
No, let me take this.

1220
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:47,004
I could give a whole talk on this.

1221
00:56:50,070 --> 00:56:55,712
I s- we spent like two months straight towards the end of the project working on the difficulty

1222
00:56:55,752 --> 00:56:58,913
tuning, um, which was not accounted for, so sorry production.

1223
00:56:59,753 --> 00:57:04,934
Uh, yeah, so- so we, um, a lot of us on the combat team are really big Devil May Cry fans,

1224
00:57:05,134 --> 00:57:08,595
and so whenever we used to play Dante Must Die, we- we loved the way that difficulty

1225
00:57:08,615 --> 00:57:08,995
was handled.

1226
00:57:09,495 --> 00:57:12,917
And so we, you know, at the time, our lead gameplay designer, Jason McDonald,

1227
00:57:13,378 --> 00:57:17,420
he was like, you know, we're gonna make a hard difficulty and we're gonna do it right.

1228
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:20,722
Like, we're gonna do it where it feels like a different game, and it's a different combat puzzle.

1229
00:57:21,702 --> 00:57:27,185
And so, man, I can't get into the details too much right now, but like, almost, man,

1230
00:57:27,325 --> 00:57:30,447
like almost everything in the combat system is different for those difficulties.

1231
00:57:31,081 --> 00:57:32,442
far more than people would expect.

1232
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:34,024
Like we even treat the stats differently

1233
00:57:34,085 --> 00:57:35,026
on the different difficulties.

1234
00:57:35,406 --> 00:57:37,329
Like the stat tuning curves are completely different.

1235
00:57:37,369 --> 00:57:41,134
So your choices in what you choose to equip

1236
00:57:41,614 --> 00:57:42,335
matter a lot more.

1237
00:57:42,355 --> 00:57:46,200
As just an example of something you might not have expected.

1238
00:57:46,280 --> 00:57:47,201
But yeah, it's.

1239
00:57:47,782 --> 00:57:49,084
Are they like more aggressive or?

1240
00:57:49,665 --> 00:57:50,706
On the aggression side, yes.

1241
00:57:50,746 --> 00:57:52,668
So remember that token slide that I said?

1242
00:57:53,709 --> 00:57:55,570
We changed the amount that enemies take.

1243
00:57:55,590 --> 00:57:58,472
So let's say if you have 10 tokens available

1244
00:57:58,572 --> 00:58:00,774
and an enemy takes up four, then it's like, OK, well,

1245
00:58:00,794 --> 00:58:02,956
only two can be aggressive at any time.

1246
00:58:03,296 --> 00:58:04,497
We would shrink that down to three.

1247
00:58:04,877 --> 00:58:07,119
So then you could have three enemies on you at any one time.

1248
00:58:07,339 --> 00:58:08,060
That's an example.

1249
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,262
But in a more complicated way, we actually

1250
00:58:10,302 --> 00:58:11,442
change up the attacks that enemies

1251
00:58:11,462 --> 00:58:13,024
do on harder difficulties.

1252
00:58:14,145 --> 00:58:16,626
And we kind of make combo strings possible with enemies

1253
00:58:16,667 --> 00:58:18,288
that they weren't able to do previously as well.

1254
00:58:18,819 --> 00:58:21,140
So it's like a multifaceted approach

1255
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:22,740
to overall change the experience.

1256
00:58:23,420 --> 00:58:24,140
Good, thank you.

1257
00:58:24,380 --> 00:58:24,600
Thanks.

1258
00:58:25,761 --> 00:58:27,661
I think we might have time for just this last one.

1259
00:58:28,501 --> 00:58:31,662
Yeah, very quickly, I hope I did not miss that

1260
00:58:31,682 --> 00:58:33,662
in the presentation, which was great, by the way.

1261
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,923
The amount of token that's available to the player,

1262
00:58:36,963 --> 00:58:37,883
is it dynamic?

1263
00:58:37,983 --> 00:58:41,084
Is it where, where does this fixed number come from?

1264
00:58:41,846 --> 00:58:48,048
So the question is the tokens that the player has for aggression is that dynamic?

1265
00:58:48,389 --> 00:58:56,132
And the answer is actually no, but in practice, we change it on the enemy side.

1266
00:58:56,612 --> 00:58:57,673
So not on the player side.

1267
00:58:58,133 --> 00:59:01,755
That number is a funny number. It's a pretty legacy, honestly.

1268
00:59:01,855 --> 00:59:04,976
It's just a thing with God of War, even in past games, where there would be this number

1269
00:59:05,276 --> 00:59:06,377
and we just kind of stuck to it.

1270
00:59:08,263 --> 00:59:09,704
I don't know, we didn't really change it too much,

1271
00:59:09,944 --> 00:59:11,986
but we would kind of change the enemies,

1272
00:59:12,827 --> 00:59:13,567
the amount that they took.

1273
00:59:13,947 --> 00:59:15,909
But it wouldn't be dynamic in the game.

1274
00:59:16,109 --> 00:59:18,711
It would be more that per difficulty we would change it.

1275
00:59:19,472 --> 00:59:20,913
Within the same difficulty, it never changed.

1276
00:59:20,933 --> 00:59:23,655
You can think of it as being statically defined

1277
00:59:23,715 --> 00:59:26,858
on a per kind of a mode basis.

1278
00:59:27,398 --> 00:59:29,320
Okay, so it remains the same throughout the game,

1279
00:59:29,980 --> 00:59:32,643
no matter your level, it's just like, okay, it's 12 now.

1280
00:59:32,703 --> 00:59:35,345
Yeah, for a specific cast member, it remains the same.

1281
00:59:35,845 --> 00:59:36,666
Okay, thank you very much.

1282
00:59:37,552 --> 00:59:44,504
Cool. And if there are any uh, more questions, I can take it in the, in a wrap up room. 3020.

1283
00:59:45,085 --> 00:59:47,670
Alright. So yeah, I'll head over to 3020 if there's any more questions I can take them

1284
00:59:47,690 --> 00:59:48,711
there. Thank you so much guys.
