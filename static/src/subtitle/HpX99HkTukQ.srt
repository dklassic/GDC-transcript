1
00:00:11,780 --> 00:00:12,380
Hi, everybody.

2
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:13,620
Thanks for joining me.

3
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:15,120
I'm here in Montreal, Canada.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:16,681
I hope everybody's doing well over there.

5
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:18,401
So yeah, let's get started.

6
00:00:18,441 --> 00:00:20,161
I'm gonna take you through an epic journey

7
00:00:20,241 --> 00:00:21,381
through the audio universe

8
00:00:21,421 --> 00:00:23,442
that is Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.

9
00:00:23,942 --> 00:00:24,862
So let's dive right in.

10
00:00:25,462 --> 00:00:26,722
So introduction first.

11
00:00:28,743 --> 00:00:29,723
I'm Steve Shepkowski.

12
00:00:30,643 --> 00:00:31,663
And if you're wondering,

13
00:00:31,983 --> 00:00:34,504
the last name is pronounced Shep-kow-ski

14
00:00:34,864 --> 00:00:35,964
and there won't be a test.

15
00:00:36,284 --> 00:00:37,484
You can not worry about it.

16
00:00:38,164 --> 00:00:39,565
So moving forward.

17
00:00:40,703 --> 00:00:46,425
I've been an audio director in the video game industry for the last 20 years, and I've been

18
00:00:46,445 --> 00:00:49,866
the senior audio director with Eidos Montreal for the last 15 years.

19
00:00:50,627 --> 00:00:57,889
And basically, some of the titles that I've shipped would be Human Revolution, Deus Ex,

20
00:00:58,529 --> 00:01:06,212
Deus Ex Mankind Divided, the live Breach mode that we had, and all the DLCs as well as promotional

21
00:01:06,252 --> 00:01:06,692
material.

22
00:01:08,894 --> 00:01:13,997
Another interesting thing to note is I've been a performing rock musician for the last 30 years.

23
00:01:14,037 --> 00:01:18,999
And if you need some proof of that, well, here I am in all my spray net 80s glory.

24
00:01:19,819 --> 00:01:24,162
Here I am in the 90s trying to look as angst and grunge worthy as possible.

25
00:01:25,182 --> 00:01:26,163
And here I am today.

26
00:01:26,483 --> 00:01:30,225
So this will conclude the comedy portion of the presentation in case you were wondering.

27
00:01:31,425 --> 00:01:34,907
And the last thing I'm going to mention is as a kid, I grew up on a healthy diet.

28
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:40,430
Of comic books, Marvel books, Stephen King books, Big Reader,

29
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:45,632
loved horror and science fiction, and a healthy dose of rock and roll.

30
00:01:46,492 --> 00:01:49,973
So all of these passions prepared me for my role

31
00:01:50,273 --> 00:01:53,234
as the senior audio director on Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy.

32
00:01:54,175 --> 00:01:57,636
So we got some destinations today on our journey.

33
00:01:58,796 --> 00:02:01,037
Pre-production, we're going to take an overlook at the steps

34
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:04,398
we took to scope the game and define our vision and to get the right pieces

35
00:02:04,458 --> 00:02:04,838
in place.

36
00:02:06,405 --> 00:02:07,466
We're gonna look at production

37
00:02:07,546 --> 00:02:10,388
and how we managed to get everything we wanted in

38
00:02:11,068 --> 00:02:12,209
and a few extras.

39
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:15,231
And finally, the closing and the mix,

40
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:17,673
a look at the climactic finale to our journey.

41
00:02:19,154 --> 00:02:21,195
So our journey begins a few years ago.

42
00:02:22,616 --> 00:02:26,118
So in pre-production, we asked a lot of questions.

43
00:02:26,298 --> 00:02:28,640
So starting with what we needed to have

44
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:31,002
once this phase would be finished.

45
00:02:31,082 --> 00:02:33,843
So things we needed to have and be ready for

46
00:02:33,903 --> 00:02:35,144
as we stepped into production.

47
00:02:36,014 --> 00:02:37,836
So of course, we were going to need a composer.

48
00:02:37,856 --> 00:02:42,742
We were going to need a music licensing partner because I knew I wanted to have

49
00:02:42,802 --> 00:02:45,085
licensed music in this game.

50
00:02:46,286 --> 00:02:49,770
We're going to need a solid sound design plan because this was going to be bigger

51
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,352
and different than anything I had ever done.

52
00:02:52,574 --> 00:02:54,957
And X factors, which I'll get to in a little bit.

53
00:02:55,657 --> 00:02:55,798
So.

54
00:02:57,323 --> 00:03:00,004
Questions for the composer, what do we want as a score?

55
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:04,066
Well, I knew we wanted a big, epic, orchestrated score.

56
00:03:04,126 --> 00:03:05,326
It had to feel Marvel.

57
00:03:05,766 --> 00:03:08,047
I wanted the feeling of a Saturday matinee

58
00:03:08,087 --> 00:03:09,528
when you and your friends were sitting there

59
00:03:09,928 --> 00:03:11,949
waiting for something like Star Wars to begin,

60
00:03:11,989 --> 00:03:13,089
and when the lights went down

61
00:03:13,129 --> 00:03:15,050
and you all start throwing popcorn at the screen

62
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,830
and yelling, that feeling of excitement,

63
00:03:16,870 --> 00:03:18,771
almost like a rollercoaster about to take off.

64
00:03:19,858 --> 00:03:21,901
Musically, this would be a huge undertaking.

65
00:03:21,941 --> 00:03:25,385
There was going to be massive deliverables, recording a full orchestra.

66
00:03:25,405 --> 00:03:26,847
It was something I had never done.

67
00:03:27,148 --> 00:03:31,233
So I was going to need to rely on the composer quite a bit, which

68
00:03:31,313 --> 00:03:32,495
brings me to my next point.

69
00:03:32,535 --> 00:03:34,878
There was going to need to be a lot of trust between us.

70
00:03:36,250 --> 00:03:39,311
And ultimately, creatively, someone I could mesh with.

71
00:03:39,551 --> 00:03:42,172
So I needed to answer all these questions.

72
00:03:42,492 --> 00:03:45,653
And thankfully, one man checked off all those boxes

73
00:03:45,753 --> 00:03:48,374
and that magical man was Mr. Richard Jakes.

74
00:03:49,634 --> 00:03:50,815
For those of you who don't know,

75
00:03:50,915 --> 00:03:52,975
this is some of Richard's credentials.

76
00:03:53,816 --> 00:03:56,036
And if there are any James Bond fans out there

77
00:03:56,076 --> 00:03:58,757
who haven't played or listened to the score from Bloodstone,

78
00:03:58,817 --> 00:03:59,818
I highly recommend it.

79
00:03:59,898 --> 00:04:01,158
It was very impressive.

80
00:04:01,598 --> 00:04:03,279
And it showed me what Richard could do

81
00:04:03,339 --> 00:04:05,400
and it gave me a lot of confidence moving forward.

82
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:10,864
The budget for this game was originally for four hours of music recording.

83
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:14,287
The game grew and at one point I told production,

84
00:04:14,327 --> 00:04:18,770
look, we need to add at least another hour of music and recording time or it's not going to be enough.

85
00:04:19,631 --> 00:04:22,933
Thankfully, I had a great production team that trusted me and listened to me

86
00:04:22,993 --> 00:04:26,155
and we did make the decision to go ahead and it was the right one.

87
00:04:26,215 --> 00:04:29,498
We completed the game with just over five hours of scored music,

88
00:04:30,018 --> 00:04:32,780
all recorded at Abbey Road Studios, which I'll get to in a bit.

89
00:04:34,067 --> 00:04:37,712
And just so you know, there was close to six hours of cinematics in the game.

90
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,135
We would need to be creative on how to cover all this.

91
00:04:40,155 --> 00:04:43,499
And of course, when I say six hours, it's not a true number because we have a lot

92
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:48,045
of branching dialogues, but it's still way over the original estimate.

93
00:04:48,946 --> 00:04:52,231
So it was fine, but we would need to keep that in mind as we went forward.

94
00:04:53,342 --> 00:04:57,624
So one thing I really wanted to focus on with the music was musical pillars,

95
00:04:57,704 --> 00:04:59,045
and one of them was themes.

96
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:03,447
And when I asked for the pitch to the composers, I made a very strong push

97
00:05:03,487 --> 00:05:05,088
saying I wanted to hear themes.

98
00:05:05,148 --> 00:05:08,589
If you were going to give me something like a main theme, well, I wanted to

99
00:05:08,629 --> 00:05:11,911
hear variations of it because I wanted that to be present in the game.

100
00:05:12,531 --> 00:05:16,033
Unknowingly, this would help me quite a bit as it allowed me to reuse music

101
00:05:16,113 --> 00:05:19,174
over the course of the game, which is a term known as leitmotif.

102
00:05:20,714 --> 00:05:24,758
Some of the themes we focused on were loss and grief, which was a huge theme in our game.

103
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:28,922
Nova Corps, which we gave like their own military theme.

104
00:05:29,742 --> 00:05:33,546
Lady Hellbender, who had a huge chapter devoted to herself,

105
00:05:33,626 --> 00:05:36,709
plus we visited her planet, so she definitely warranted her own theme.

106
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:41,519
The universal church of truth and Raker, who was our antagonist.

107
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,383
The Magus, which we came up with a very cool sound design effect

108
00:05:46,423 --> 00:05:49,505
that we always used when it was involving the Magus or the promise.

109
00:05:50,466 --> 00:05:54,169
And the most importantly, the hero theme, which was our main guardian's theme,

110
00:05:54,389 --> 00:05:56,951
which you'll hear a little in a little bit with our composer.

111
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:01,555
So now jumping to one of the next pillars we were talking about in pre-prod

112
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:02,655
was the licensed music.

113
00:06:02,716 --> 00:06:05,418
So this game's music would be 80s bass.

114
00:06:05,458 --> 00:06:06,819
That was something we had decided.

115
00:06:07,845 --> 00:06:11,168
So the questions came again, what songs would we need or want?

116
00:06:11,689 --> 00:06:12,850
What styles do we want?

117
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:14,952
So I did a big exploration.

118
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,255
Thankfully, I had a huge knowledge of the 80s music already.

119
00:06:19,476 --> 00:06:23,580
And the conclusion we came to was sort of rock, pop and new wave work the best.

120
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:26,863
We tried almost everything, but that seemed to be the right recipe.

121
00:06:27,835 --> 00:06:32,598
Now, how many songs can we afford to have in the game? How will we use them all? How can we

122
00:06:32,678 --> 00:06:37,362
maximize our return on this, meaning the money that we were shelling out for all this? You

123
00:06:37,402 --> 00:06:41,165
definitely want to make sure you're hearing the song and using it as much as you can,

124
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:47,049
and not just using it for like 10 seconds. Most importantly, who's going to take care of the legal

125
00:06:47,109 --> 00:06:51,713
side of obtaining these songs and clearing all the uses? I mean, I had a good knowledge in

126
00:06:51,773 --> 00:06:56,877
publishing and being a musician for the last 30 years, but this was beyond anything I had ever

127
00:06:56,937 --> 00:06:57,117
done.

128
00:06:58,048 --> 00:07:00,649
So thankfully, I hooked up with this gentleman here,

129
00:07:00,729 --> 00:07:02,790
Randy Eckhart from Eckhart Consulting.

130
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:06,151
Randy worked on a lot of the early EA games

131
00:07:06,191 --> 00:07:07,972
and the Guitar Hero franchise games.

132
00:07:08,652 --> 00:07:12,493
He came highly recommended through a trusted friend

133
00:07:12,853 --> 00:07:14,074
and peer in the industry.

134
00:07:14,934 --> 00:07:18,035
And he had contacts both with legal and with the labels,

135
00:07:18,075 --> 00:07:19,955
which I knew was a bonus right off the bat.

136
00:07:21,296 --> 00:07:23,697
Plus he had advice on how we should proceed forward

137
00:07:23,817 --> 00:07:26,377
using terms that would work for all the marquee artists

138
00:07:26,678 --> 00:07:27,378
as well as us.

139
00:07:29,399 --> 00:07:42,908
So we started with a list of about 50 songs that we explored and just kept shaving the list down and adding to it. I still didn't know all the ways I would use licensed music, just that the IP needed it. So I continued exploring and just messing around with music.

140
00:07:45,052 --> 00:07:56,056
As I played with the licensed music and I was looking for ways to make the most of the songs and the money we were spending, it just hit me all the more that I really needed to find a good way to use all this.

141
00:07:56,116 --> 00:08:02,838
We were investing quite a bit of money into the licensed music side and I wanted to make sure we got back a great return on it.

142
00:08:03,559 --> 00:08:07,520
So I'm going to circle back to this topic. It's going to be a theme that I hit a few times.

143
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:15,069
So now looking at the sound design, we looked at identifying some of the most important sounds we were going to hear in the game over and over again.

144
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:19,835
Starlord's Elemental Blaster was at the top of the list. It's where we put the most efforts.

145
00:08:19,916 --> 00:08:24,742
The rate of fire, the volume sitting in the mix, the stereo feel we wanted of the guns.

146
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,860
The Milano and the hyperspeed transition was another very important one

147
00:08:30,521 --> 00:08:32,041
that we knew we'd hear a lot in the game.

148
00:08:32,841 --> 00:08:37,802
Star-Lord's visor effect, which we definitely wanted a difference in the environment.

149
00:08:37,882 --> 00:08:41,003
We played with cutting ambiences out, adding reverbs,

150
00:08:41,043 --> 00:08:44,923
and I think we found a cool recipe for when the visor went on and it wasn't too annoying.

151
00:08:46,224 --> 00:08:49,604
Combat special attacks, there was a lot of special attacks from the Guardians.

152
00:08:49,624 --> 00:08:51,405
We were going to have to treat all of these as well.

153
00:08:52,125 --> 00:08:54,445
And finally, all the aliens and creatures in our game.

154
00:08:55,597 --> 00:08:58,899
So looking at that last subject, this was a huge subject for me.

155
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:05,463
I knew one of the maps we were visiting in the game was nowhere, and I wanted that credible

156
00:09:05,543 --> 00:09:09,766
Star Wars feeling to anywhere we had aliens in the game.

157
00:09:09,806 --> 00:09:12,628
I just felt Star Wars was the bar we were aiming for.

158
00:09:13,449 --> 00:09:17,692
I did a focus group test with some local actors who I knew could do some really interesting

159
00:09:17,712 --> 00:09:18,352
weird voices.

160
00:09:19,113 --> 00:09:20,634
But it wasn't right and I knew it.

161
00:09:20,814 --> 00:09:24,697
It still felt a bit too cartoony and Saturday morning animation driven,

162
00:09:24,757 --> 00:09:26,518
and it wasn't really right.

163
00:09:27,479 --> 00:09:29,781
So how was I going to create what I had in my head?

164
00:09:30,742 --> 00:09:32,783
Well, thankfully, the universe delivered to me.

165
00:09:34,291 --> 00:09:39,834
The Monster Factory, or Le Fabrique des Monstres, and what this is, is a local troupe made of

166
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:45,397
death metal singers that actually has singers, they're based here but they have singers all

167
00:09:45,437 --> 00:09:46,017
over the world.

168
00:09:46,858 --> 00:09:52,541
And these are people that can do very aggressive things with their voices that normal actors

169
00:09:52,621 --> 00:09:53,741
probably wouldn't want to do.

170
00:09:54,705 --> 00:10:00,189
So it was a very interesting concept to me. So I met with their head monster, which was

171
00:10:00,409 --> 00:10:06,353
Sébastien Croteau. He's the head of the company, and we would meet weekly and discuss ideas and

172
00:10:06,393 --> 00:10:11,857
see if there was a good creative fit. So I told them I wanted nowhere in the game to feel authentic

173
00:10:11,917 --> 00:10:17,300
and rich using the Star Wars cantina as seen as the reference. And we would spend a lot of time

174
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:19,001
talking and pitching ideas.

175
00:10:20,132 --> 00:10:25,598
We would also, we decided we would need alien languages to be created as well as creature source sounds.

176
00:10:25,638 --> 00:10:30,523
So it wasn't just getting actors who could get in front of the mic and do something really cool.

177
00:10:31,003 --> 00:10:38,211
It was going to actually need, because we had races of aliens, we needed to be more consistent and actually have languages created.

178
00:10:38,892 --> 00:10:41,615
So this was going to be a huge, huge amount of work.

179
00:10:43,073 --> 00:10:49,038
However, we spent six months to a year just crafting our design through film references

180
00:10:49,598 --> 00:10:52,741
and test recordings and created a giant reference Bible.

181
00:10:54,022 --> 00:10:58,345
To support narrative, we had to make some languages English, but we still tried to make

182
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,285
them sound alien.

183
00:10:59,326 --> 00:11:04,089
I didn't want to cheapen out and just give them like some British or exotic accent and

184
00:11:04,109 --> 00:11:05,050
be like, well, there you go.

185
00:11:05,130 --> 00:11:07,091
We said, no, let's try and keep it alien.

186
00:11:07,992 --> 00:11:09,833
I'll show you some examples as we go forward.

187
00:11:11,008 --> 00:11:17,035
And we would have to lock into design for every creature during production and start thinking about getting it all recorded.

188
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:20,060
Casting the actors to support the design.

189
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:25,062
So how this happened was during all those weekly meetings and reference Bible talks,

190
00:11:25,102 --> 00:11:30,343
Sebastien would send me demos that he would do himself, like for this creature, how about this?

191
00:11:30,823 --> 00:11:34,724
And the ones that I liked, we would lock it in saying, OK, that's the design.

192
00:11:35,124 --> 00:11:38,865
And then he would look in his troupe of singers and performers

193
00:11:39,205 --> 00:11:42,166
for people who could do that voice that was needed.

194
00:11:42,586 --> 00:11:46,627
And by doing so, we eventually found all our actors that would fill out our cast.

195
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:48,204
So.

196
00:11:49,662 --> 00:11:52,243
This is just to show you a bit of the tracking that I did.

197
00:11:52,283 --> 00:11:54,404
These are some of the aliens that appear.

198
00:11:54,424 --> 00:11:55,105
This is a creature.

199
00:11:55,505 --> 00:11:56,645
These are some of the races.

200
00:11:57,406 --> 00:11:59,727
And you'll see all these little write-ups, basically,

201
00:11:59,827 --> 00:12:01,748
I created on my own to help Seb,

202
00:12:01,808 --> 00:12:03,849
because when creating the languages,

203
00:12:04,169 --> 00:12:05,549
I mean, the guy's really intelligent,

204
00:12:05,569 --> 00:12:07,610
and he wanted to know, well, is this a warring race?

205
00:12:07,630 --> 00:12:10,972
Because if it is, it's going to be very strict on hard consonants

206
00:12:11,052 --> 00:12:14,153
and cock-a-doodle-doo and, like, these big sort of things.

207
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:16,054
And if they were a peaceful race,

208
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:18,315
it would have a completely different language approach.

209
00:12:18,375 --> 00:12:18,495
So...

210
00:12:19,135 --> 00:12:24,220
That was great for him, and for me, I needed to track where they're going to need facial recording.

211
00:12:24,260 --> 00:12:28,843
If it was facial, well, the union here says you have to do X amount of hours, so then I have to

212
00:12:28,963 --> 00:12:35,108
fill that recording time with enough content for them to record. So this was all a lot of tracking

213
00:12:35,148 --> 00:12:40,833
for me, but it showed you I had line counts, whether they needed face cam, just voice cam.

214
00:12:40,853 --> 00:12:41,774
It was very complex.

215
00:12:42,818 --> 00:12:45,399
So let's jump to the X-Factors, okay?

216
00:12:45,419 --> 00:12:47,720
And I'm going to tell you what my X-Factors were.

217
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:50,361
So the definition of variable in any given situation

218
00:12:50,821 --> 00:12:53,182
that could have the most significant impact on the outcome.

219
00:12:53,862 --> 00:12:55,703
What I'm meaning about X-Factors

220
00:12:55,743 --> 00:12:57,704
is I was looking for audio X-Factors.

221
00:12:57,784 --> 00:13:00,344
I knew this game lent itself well to audio

222
00:13:00,404 --> 00:13:02,265
and I wanted to take full advantage of that.

223
00:13:03,125 --> 00:13:05,206
So looking for X-Factors, we found a few.

224
00:13:05,706 --> 00:13:07,207
One being the Star-Lord album,

225
00:13:08,567 --> 00:13:10,568
one being the jukebox inside the Milano,

226
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:12,128
the huddle.

227
00:13:13,065 --> 00:13:18,889
a feature in our game, and the Milano, sorry, the main menu in our game.

228
00:13:19,610 --> 00:13:20,911
So now let's take a look at these.

229
00:13:21,091 --> 00:13:25,755
So starting with the Star-Lord band, this is the album cover of the album we've made.

230
00:13:26,255 --> 00:13:30,619
The concept was that Peter Quill took the name of Star-Lord because he grew up worshipping

231
00:13:30,659 --> 00:13:32,520
a band from the 80s called Star-Lord.

232
00:13:32,801 --> 00:13:36,584
I thought it was a brilliant concept, and it was another way that we were able to sort

233
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:41,388
of make this Guardians our own version as compared to the MCU.

234
00:13:43,524 --> 00:13:47,707
So could we write and record the actual album and make it available in the game?

235
00:13:47,947 --> 00:13:51,730
I mean, I definitely wanted to, but I had no idea if I'd be able to pull this off.

236
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,872
So how would I pull this off? See, I'm getting ahead of the slides now.

237
00:13:56,373 --> 00:13:59,515
How would I pull this off? Well, that's a great question. I thought a lot about it,

238
00:14:00,135 --> 00:14:04,658
and I would need to partner with somebody. So I partnered with Yoann Boudreaux.

239
00:14:05,195 --> 00:14:08,156
who's the head of his own company, Alchemic Audio.

240
00:14:08,716 --> 00:14:10,357
Yoann Boudreau is a friend of mine.

241
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:15,239
He's also an amazing musician, but he's also the mixer

242
00:14:15,459 --> 00:14:18,680
for all of our trailers and any of our promotional stuff

243
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,001
for Guardians, as well as past projects.

244
00:14:21,521 --> 00:14:24,562
And he's been a recording engineer that we use for all our MoCap

245
00:14:24,602 --> 00:14:26,303
recordings and all our VO recordings.

246
00:14:26,363 --> 00:14:27,823
So we have a great history together.

247
00:14:29,435 --> 00:14:34,520
So we wrote and recorded Space Riders, the song off the album, as our first demo because

248
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,182
we needed to do a proof of concept, could we do this?

249
00:14:39,001 --> 00:14:44,425
And for those of you who don't know the story, basically I presented the song to our creative

250
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:49,049
director without telling him it was me singing it. My intent was always to find another singer

251
00:14:49,089 --> 00:14:53,774
who would come in and do the singing. But our creative director heard it and he was like,

252
00:14:53,814 --> 00:14:56,896
who's singing? And I said, it was me. And he was like, really, it's you? And he's like,

253
00:14:56,956 --> 00:15:01,080
okay, you're going to be the singer. So inside, I was super excited. As a guy who's been playing

254
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,742
in bands all my life, I couldn't believe I was going to have this opportunity.

255
00:15:04,423 --> 00:15:08,986
So our next step was for me to sit down with JF and go, well, what are we going to write about?

256
00:15:09,046 --> 00:15:17,311
Because obviously I can't make this like, you know, a Motley Crue record about, you know, strippers and stuff and weird things that don't fit into this universe.

257
00:15:17,791 --> 00:15:23,655
And he was like, no, we're going to focus on, you know, believing in yourself, family, overcoming the odds, grief.

258
00:15:23,935 --> 00:15:25,376
These were the themes of our game.

259
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,997
So we wrote all the songs around that.

260
00:15:27,557 --> 00:15:30,459
The album was written and recorded in about two and a half years.

261
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,441
So now jumping to the huddle.

262
00:15:35,112 --> 00:15:39,379
Design had a great concept for like a Hail Mary type speech when things were going bad

263
00:15:39,439 --> 00:15:42,184
that would give the team a boost when you needed it.

264
00:15:43,354 --> 00:15:46,316
So it was a great concept, a great idea.

265
00:15:46,336 --> 00:15:50,660
And looking for ways to get more use out of our licensed songs,

266
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:53,042
that point that I said I wanted to keep coming back to,

267
00:15:53,642 --> 00:15:56,264
I tried putting the songs underneath some footage one day

268
00:15:56,284 --> 00:15:57,585
that I'd captured of combat.

269
00:15:57,605 --> 00:15:58,946
And I just brought it into the DAW,

270
00:15:59,547 --> 00:16:01,288
and I killed the score that was under it,

271
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,250
and I just brought in some licensed track.

272
00:16:03,310 --> 00:16:06,072
And I was like, huh, that's pretty cool

273
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:08,114
having this after the payoff, you know,

274
00:16:08,134 --> 00:16:09,335
like having after the speech.

275
00:16:10,867 --> 00:16:11,928
But here's what we had.

276
00:16:11,968 --> 00:16:14,209
I want you to see it in its original form

277
00:16:14,269 --> 00:16:15,630
without the payoff at the end.

278
00:16:15,670 --> 00:16:18,231
And this will focus more on the speech part, the first part.

279
00:16:19,152 --> 00:16:20,393
Guys, huddle up!

280
00:16:27,477 --> 00:16:29,498
I cannot fight beside you any longer, rodent.

281
00:16:30,078 --> 00:16:32,059
Your battle skills are sloppy and erratic.

282
00:16:32,199 --> 00:16:32,980
My skills?

283
00:16:33,240 --> 00:16:35,961
You've got all the subtlety of a brain-dead battering ram.

284
00:16:36,021 --> 00:16:37,042
Say the word, Peter Quill,

285
00:16:37,262 --> 00:16:39,423
and I shall single-handedly tear these fiends apart.

286
00:16:44,104 --> 00:16:48,569
Whoa, whoa, whoa, guys, these insults you keep tossing around.

287
00:16:48,989 --> 00:16:51,853
Are we a team or should we just throw each other's lives away?

288
00:16:52,513 --> 00:16:56,078
Because the only thing that matters here is that we knock them out together.

289
00:16:56,418 --> 00:16:58,300
Who's with me? Feel my wrath.

290
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,882
Let's do this.

291
00:17:01,123 --> 00:17:02,825
There you go. So pretty cool.

292
00:17:03,867 --> 00:17:04,087
But.

293
00:17:04,846 --> 00:17:09,990
We love the vibe, but honestly we felt we were losing the pacing a bit coming out of combat.

294
00:17:10,170 --> 00:17:14,493
It sometimes felt a bit jarring, and I'll show you what I mean in a little image that I did.

295
00:17:15,214 --> 00:17:19,737
So basically you would come out of combat and as you saw there would drop down and there's

296
00:17:19,777 --> 00:17:24,161
kind of a drone going on in the background and you'd get your speech. You'd click the walkman

297
00:17:24,201 --> 00:17:28,344
and the part you haven't seen yet, which will, we jump back into combat with the licensed track.

298
00:17:29,353 --> 00:17:33,716
But it was in this speech part that we felt we were losing people a bit.

299
00:17:34,176 --> 00:17:38,219
You know, like the energy, you come out of combat and then you're into a speech and back into combat.

300
00:17:38,839 --> 00:17:40,260
It could feel a bit jarring at times.

301
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:45,323
So what I proposed, I had this in my head forever.

302
00:17:45,724 --> 00:17:50,347
And finally, at some point in production, I sat down with Richard and I said, what do you think?

303
00:17:50,367 --> 00:17:52,688
Like, can we make this better? Can we score something?

304
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:57,491
I don't know, maybe anthem, stadium-like, you know, something a sports.

305
00:17:57,992 --> 00:18:24,003
You know, I was trying to just get a big crowd energy reference, you know, and what I showed him was I said, instead of dropping down, what if we came down, you know, instead of 100%, maybe 65 70%, and then ramped back up into combat. So it felt like during that whole speech, you saw instead of it being so static, there would be something dynamic building here. And Richard loved it. And he delivered a track to me that I fell in love with. And

306
00:18:25,444 --> 00:18:28,065
And here's the final result. I want you to hear it for yourself.

307
00:18:28,305 --> 00:18:30,726
And it includes the music payoff at the end.

308
00:18:30,806 --> 00:18:33,246
So this was our huddle feature, one of our X-Factors.

309
00:19:03,247 --> 00:19:07,528
I know we want to celebrate because we're maybe two steps away from winning this fight.

310
00:19:07,968 --> 00:19:13,369
But, if we start dancing before we actually win, these scut holes will send us to our graves.

311
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:18,050
So let's keep our focus and show these losers exactly how we rocked.

312
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,251
Who's with me?

313
00:19:19,571 --> 00:19:20,511
Victory is ours!

314
00:19:20,551 --> 00:19:21,371
Nice one, Peter!

315
00:19:22,311 --> 00:19:22,811
Time bumble!

316
00:19:22,972 --> 00:19:30,913
We don't want to be here for reinforcements!

317
00:19:30,973 --> 00:19:31,493
Don't let up!

318
00:19:53,129 --> 00:19:53,770
So there you go.

319
00:19:53,990 --> 00:19:56,930
That's the huddle, how it finished and how it shipped.

320
00:19:56,970 --> 00:20:01,291
And I was really happy that we were able, in my opinion, to make it better and more

321
00:20:01,351 --> 00:20:03,271
dynamic during that speech part.

322
00:20:04,268 --> 00:20:07,449
So now looking at a few of the other X factors that I mentioned, the Milano

323
00:20:07,489 --> 00:20:13,471
jukebox. So it seems simple enough, but God, what a valuable tool to have in our,

324
00:20:13,531 --> 00:20:17,972
in our box is what an asset to have, because, um, we felt in trying to

325
00:20:18,033 --> 00:20:21,293
establish the Milano as the guardian's home in the game, you're constantly

326
00:20:21,333 --> 00:20:25,075
going on missions. And then a lot of times you end up back in the Milano to

327
00:20:25,115 --> 00:20:29,016
head somewhere else, go and hit a new planet, come back to the Milano, etc.

328
00:20:29,036 --> 00:20:29,136
So.

329
00:20:30,218 --> 00:20:33,779
In trying to establish the Milano as the Guardian's home, music could help a lot.

330
00:20:33,879 --> 00:20:39,821
Like for me, as a musician, obviously here in my house, there's always music playing in one room or the other.

331
00:20:39,861 --> 00:20:41,681
There's music always going in the house.

332
00:20:41,761 --> 00:20:48,723
So a great way to sort of sell the concept that the Milano is their home is to have music available all the time.

333
00:20:50,104 --> 00:21:06,791
The other great thing was it gave us the ability to use music to help set the mood to the Guardian's current vibe and have it stage important conversations as we couldn't score everything it was just too big of a game. So this became a great tool and again hitting that point that I made about maximizing

334
00:21:07,972 --> 00:21:10,833
that we were paying out for all this music,

335
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:12,773
I wanted to use it as much as possible.

336
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:16,394
So this gave us a great tool that we could,

337
00:21:16,894 --> 00:21:19,055
if they came from a planet and they were in a tense

338
00:21:19,595 --> 00:21:21,055
sort of argument amongst themselves,

339
00:21:21,095 --> 00:21:23,596
well, we would put on a song that would reflect that vibe

340
00:21:24,096 --> 00:21:25,197
and it worked really well.

341
00:21:26,197 --> 00:21:28,198
The other thing that it also did is

342
00:21:28,638 --> 00:21:30,198
using the use of licensed music,

343
00:21:30,758 --> 00:21:33,319
it helps us to make our characters feel much more human

344
00:21:33,379 --> 00:21:35,280
because despite their alien origins,

345
00:21:36,112 --> 00:21:39,713
It helps establish a common ground between the game's cast and its players.

346
00:21:40,293 --> 00:21:46,636
So, you know, having Drax or Gamora or Rocket, you know, or even Groot comment and reference,

347
00:21:46,916 --> 00:21:50,318
you know, one of the licensed tracks that it was either playing in the Milano or something,

348
00:21:51,518 --> 00:21:56,501
it made it easier for the player to bond with these characters who did have a very alien

349
00:21:56,561 --> 00:22:03,504
background. So again, you know, it was a great win on many fronts. So let's have a quick look

350
00:22:03,524 --> 00:22:05,225
at the jukebox.

351
00:22:09,825 --> 00:22:14,246
So Drax, excited to meet our buyer after we catch the monster?

352
00:22:14,807 --> 00:22:19,128
Of course! Lady Hellbender is a legendary warrior and a noble queen.

353
00:22:19,509 --> 00:22:20,449
And she's rich.

354
00:22:20,769 --> 00:22:23,490
That is not a prowess, simply a commercial fact.

355
00:22:24,150 --> 00:22:27,672
As long as she buys her monster, she doesn't need to be royalty.

356
00:22:28,152 --> 00:22:30,033
You are jealous of her status.

357
00:22:30,933 --> 00:22:35,335
So there you go, what was great was it was interactive so the player could

358
00:22:35,935 --> 00:22:38,856
pick and choose songs as they walked around the Milano, which was great.

359
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:39,577
It was a really good experience.

360
00:22:40,189 --> 00:22:44,852
Really good x factor that we found. So staying on that topic the main menu.

361
00:22:45,872 --> 00:22:55,438
Someone at one point early on in production showed me the static image, and there was something about it I just fell in love with I love the fact that Peter was sitting there with his Walkman and it triggered an idea.

362
00:22:55,458 --> 00:22:55,498
So,

363
00:22:58,053 --> 00:23:01,516
I was like, instead of normal menu music, cause I didn't even know what I would use

364
00:23:01,576 --> 00:23:06,259
as a menu music, cause we were going very classic score and it didn't seem like it would

365
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:07,279
fit in the opening.

366
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:11,382
I was like, what if we somehow use this to showcase our licensed music?

367
00:23:11,442 --> 00:23:16,165
So I took this image, I brought it into my DAW, I stretched it out to about a minute

368
00:23:16,765 --> 00:23:22,168
and then I just started grabbing snippets of our licensed tracks and putting fast forward

369
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,910
and rewind sounds in between them.

370
00:23:24,450 --> 00:23:27,192
Really just trying to emulate Star-Lord sitting there.

371
00:23:28,108 --> 00:23:31,189
And scrolling through his Walkman as if he was looking for a certain song.

372
00:23:32,309 --> 00:23:37,570
So, um, at one point creative saw it and they just fell in love with it.

373
00:23:37,590 --> 00:23:39,891
And they came back and they said, listen, we're going to run with it.

374
00:23:39,931 --> 00:23:40,991
We're going to animate it all.

375
00:23:41,691 --> 00:23:42,691
And it's going to look great.

376
00:23:42,771 --> 00:23:46,272
So, you know, put it on your list as, as songs to clear and make

377
00:23:46,292 --> 00:23:48,032
sure we're, we're good for the usage.

378
00:23:49,173 --> 00:23:52,273
So here it is, uh, as, as it shipped like this.

379
00:24:13,169 --> 00:24:17,672
So, very simple concept, but very effective and it fit with the brand and the IP.

380
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:21,434
And again, I was happy to find another angle to push the music out front.

381
00:24:23,053 --> 00:24:25,354
So now we finished our first destination.

382
00:24:25,394 --> 00:24:27,255
We're going into our second one production.

383
00:24:27,515 --> 00:24:28,116
It's happening.

384
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:31,958
It's real and everything's now happening and it's time to rock and roll.

385
00:24:32,837 --> 00:24:36,721
So to give you an update on all those pillars, we just looked at the licensed music.

386
00:24:37,241 --> 00:24:38,822
Things were moving at light speed.

387
00:24:40,003 --> 00:24:43,827
We began to narrow down our song list and lock down the songs contractually via

388
00:24:43,887 --> 00:24:45,748
Randy Eckhart and our legal department.

389
00:24:46,589 --> 00:24:51,033
I began using the huddle as my testing ground for any licensed songs we were going to

390
00:24:51,073 --> 00:24:53,976
bring in or or, you know, lock down contractually.

391
00:24:54,436 --> 00:24:55,697
So they had to work in the huddle.

392
00:24:55,737 --> 00:24:57,999
Otherwise, I wasn't interested in using them.

393
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:02,996
And I started looking at using the licensed music in cinematics as well,

394
00:25:03,156 --> 00:25:06,158
mainly transitional ones to help balance the scoring budget.

395
00:25:06,178 --> 00:25:11,260
Cause I was always keeping a very sharp eye and accountant's eye on the minutes

396
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:13,741
we were using. And I'll show you that in a few slides.

397
00:25:14,722 --> 00:25:18,804
So every idea we had, whether it was the jukebox, the main menu,

398
00:25:19,124 --> 00:25:22,326
the huddle, they all had to be legally cleared.

399
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:25,287
So every time I had one of these new ideas, it just meant that I was.

400
00:25:25,794 --> 00:25:34,163
At making the game better, but making my headaches bigger because I'd have to go back to Randy and go, okay, I want to use all the music like this, go and make sure it's all cleared.

401
00:25:34,463 --> 00:25:44,554
And this is hence why Randy and I were working together for quite a while because it took quite a while to get everything cleared but we managed to get clearance for everything, which was great.

402
00:25:45,906 --> 00:25:49,088
And the process, I can't tell you, was a huge learning experience for me.

403
00:25:49,108 --> 00:25:51,969
I mean, I had a music background, so I knew what publishing was and

404
00:25:52,310 --> 00:25:56,012
mechanicals and performance rights, but this took it to a whole new level.

405
00:25:56,352 --> 00:26:00,734
And, um, I just tried to be a sponge and learn as much as I could from Randy and

406
00:26:00,995 --> 00:26:03,336
all the experts I was surrounding myself with.

407
00:26:04,752 --> 00:26:08,635
So again, licensed music, we began to spread the licensed music throughout the game.

408
00:26:09,436 --> 00:26:12,558
And Richard, the composer, and I had to really focus on all the musical

409
00:26:12,618 --> 00:26:16,301
transitions because often we were going to go from a licensed track to the

410
00:26:16,361 --> 00:26:19,223
score or the other way around, and we had to keep it seamless.

411
00:26:19,283 --> 00:26:22,306
It had to be, you know, you couldn't have anything jarring.

412
00:26:22,346 --> 00:26:26,349
We had to respect the keys of the music and make sure everything transitioned

413
00:26:26,409 --> 00:26:26,989
seamlessly.

414
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:31,052
So we use this a lot in the game transitions, such as at the end of chapter

415
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:31,393
one.

416
00:26:33,015 --> 00:26:35,157
I ran by Flock of Seagulls into the score.

417
00:26:35,898 --> 00:26:40,363
And chapter three is one of my favorites, the everyone's a winner into the score, because

418
00:26:40,803 --> 00:26:43,166
this was the first one we kind of nailed.

419
00:26:43,326 --> 00:26:46,650
And it was tough because it's a big long scene with the music playing.

420
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,772
There's timed and untimed choice wheels.

421
00:26:49,353 --> 00:26:52,737
So you can't just put a linear track there, it would never work.

422
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:58,580
So we found tricks, we found recipes, and it took like almost bending time to do this.

423
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:03,023
Because I was really adamant, I wanted the ending of the scene when he goes,

424
00:27:03,323 --> 00:27:04,523
let's go sell a monster.

425
00:27:07,225 --> 00:27:11,067
So we go from positional audio inside the Milano to full stereo outside.

426
00:27:11,207 --> 00:27:13,648
It worked great, but it needed that ending.

427
00:27:14,189 --> 00:27:17,791
Through many trial and error, we did manage to make it work.

428
00:27:18,431 --> 00:27:21,112
And I'm going to show it to you right now so you can listen to it.

429
00:27:22,413 --> 00:27:23,013
Groot buddy.

430
00:27:23,413 --> 00:27:25,295
First of all, thank you.

431
00:27:26,295 --> 00:27:30,099
And second of all, I want you to know we're gonna bust you out of there right after, okay?

432
00:27:30,119 --> 00:27:31,800
I am Groot.

433
00:27:34,863 --> 00:27:37,265
Alright, let's do this! Let's go sell a monster!

434
00:27:38,606 --> 00:27:40,928
We're not seriously flying into this.

435
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:52,502
So the weather patterns of Sekhnarf 9 are tied to the temperament of this world.

436
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,144
That's not how women work.

437
00:27:54,325 --> 00:27:54,966
Or weather.

438
00:27:55,627 --> 00:27:57,390
Anyways, I'm sure it looks worse than it is.

439
00:28:12,495 --> 00:28:15,116
There! That's Lady Hellbender's fortress.

440
00:28:15,136 --> 00:28:17,437
Get us in close, Quill. I don't want to walk in this.

441
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:18,978
Whoa.

442
00:28:19,838 --> 00:28:21,839
There you go. Smooth, seamless.

443
00:28:23,340 --> 00:28:25,001
So now, touching back on sound.

444
00:28:26,162 --> 00:28:28,343
At our peak, we were nine on the audio team.

445
00:28:28,363 --> 00:28:32,505
It's not a huge team, including myself, my technical director, and our audio programmer.

446
00:28:32,525 --> 00:28:34,466
So basically, six content creators.

447
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:38,328
We had 16 chapters, and each sound designer had map ownership.

448
00:28:38,702 --> 00:28:42,482
They were responsible for the map and the sounds in it, as well as the music integration.

449
00:28:44,603 --> 00:28:47,943
And I now had to focus on completing the creature and alien designs,

450
00:28:48,023 --> 00:28:50,224
which was starting to drag, and I had to address it.

451
00:28:50,784 --> 00:28:55,365
So, it was now time to record all our cast for the aliens and creatures.

452
00:28:55,525 --> 00:28:59,646
We needed to gather all the animations and everything so that they could act to their

453
00:28:59,706 --> 00:29:05,007
creature NPC. We recorded it all in our mocap studio so that they could actually have freedom

454
00:29:05,067 --> 00:29:06,447
to move and get into character.

455
00:29:07,070 --> 00:29:09,051
So let's have a listen to some of nowhere.

456
00:29:09,132 --> 00:29:11,113
Listen for all the alien voices you're going to hear.

457
00:29:34,097 --> 00:29:36,838
Enjoy the wonders of the Emporium.

458
00:29:49,687 --> 00:29:51,607
I'm positive that's where the ball was.

459
00:29:51,967 --> 00:29:54,988
The eyes play tricks. Sometimes the mind can't keep up.

460
00:29:55,108 --> 00:29:57,968
Something tells me it's not my eyes playing tricks.

461
00:29:57,988 --> 00:30:00,069
A nasty bob, Captain. Thanks for the lettuce.

462
00:30:00,109 --> 00:30:01,909
Have yourself a fun day.

463
00:30:02,409 --> 00:30:04,930
Look at you, barely skin and bones.

464
00:30:08,591 --> 00:30:10,771
Moping your way through the market.

465
00:30:11,452 --> 00:30:14,272
Better have a hot bite. It'll make you feel better.

466
00:30:14,512 --> 00:30:17,073
So, you hungry or what?

467
00:30:19,353 --> 00:30:21,694
Oh, thanks. I was hoping for a friendly ear though.

468
00:30:22,634 --> 00:30:24,975
Never was one for small talk.

469
00:30:26,375 --> 00:30:29,336
Especially if you ain't a paying customer.

470
00:30:32,617 --> 00:30:35,538
So that was a bit of our showcase of Nowhere.

471
00:30:35,558 --> 00:30:42,240
And again, staying on aliens and creatures, this bad boy was the Wendigo, one of our big creatures.

472
00:30:43,240 --> 00:30:48,502
What's cool about them is they're just very vicious and aggressive, but they do yell, Wendigo.

473
00:30:49,274 --> 00:30:51,736
For whatever reason, but we thought it was really cool.

474
00:30:51,836 --> 00:30:55,539
So let's have a look at how a great monster death metal singer

475
00:30:55,599 --> 00:30:57,641
source recording can turn into the creature.

476
00:31:01,665 --> 00:31:02,125
Let's listen.

477
00:31:10,814 --> 00:31:12,395
So yeah, that was great.

478
00:31:12,535 --> 00:31:14,256
Having all that source material was awesome.

479
00:31:14,716 --> 00:31:16,157
Here's another thing I was really proud of,

480
00:31:16,197 --> 00:31:17,258
and I thought it was interesting.

481
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,979
We had the world mind, which appears in our game.

482
00:31:19,999 --> 00:31:22,261
It's a great concept for those of you who don't know.

483
00:31:22,321 --> 00:31:26,583
It's basically all the best and wisest of Xandar

484
00:31:26,603 --> 00:31:28,884
that becomes part of a collective consciousness.

485
00:31:29,805 --> 00:31:31,426
So what was cool about that is I said,

486
00:31:31,466 --> 00:31:32,967
okay, well, if it's a collective conscious,

487
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:35,428
can we use male and female voices

488
00:31:35,528 --> 00:31:37,309
and kind of run them together in sync?

489
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:40,478
Now, of course, this created a few problems for recording it,

490
00:31:40,899 --> 00:31:44,100
but we managed to just spend a bit of extra time in prep work.

491
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:46,922
And I was really happy with how it came out.

492
00:31:46,982 --> 00:31:48,122
It sounded really cool.

493
00:31:48,242 --> 00:31:49,283
So let's have a listen.

494
00:31:50,783 --> 00:31:52,464
A mass delusion known as the Promise

495
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:55,145
is sweeping its systems, converting

496
00:31:55,305 --> 00:31:56,426
all who encounter it.

497
00:31:57,126 --> 00:31:59,708
In less than three cycles, it has

498
00:31:59,748 --> 00:32:02,689
spread from the crew of a single star frigate

499
00:32:03,029 --> 00:32:06,311
to multiple outposts, worlds, and systems.

500
00:32:07,092 --> 00:32:16,239
So there you have it. I just really like the concept of having male and female voice constantly interleaving into each other and you get one or the other. I thought it was interesting.

501
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:25,946
So, looking again in production, the casting, I casted all the secondary characters in the game myself, including designing all of the enemy NPC factions.

502
00:32:26,066 --> 00:32:27,047
So what that meant was

503
00:32:27,500 --> 00:32:39,191
I had to track every secondary character and allocate roles and lines to actors to maximize recording times, as well as create the combatant pools, how many different voices or actors are needed for these pools, same for all the creature pools.

504
00:32:40,029 --> 00:32:48,552
So here's some of my sheets like you can see I was tracking how many dialogue lines they had how many barks they would have and that would give me the answer of how much time we needed.

505
00:32:49,032 --> 00:32:58,856
Plus it allowed me to see who I was reusing because again, you know when you have to record someone for two hours to me it's a complete waste of bad management.

506
00:32:59,428 --> 00:33:03,451
In that you have the actor come in for 15 minutes and you're now paying them for two hours.

507
00:33:03,511 --> 00:33:12,017
So, of course, you don't want to sacrifice quality, but I made sure that we tried to maximize if we had them for two hours, they were recording for at least 90 minutes.

508
00:33:13,619 --> 00:33:22,245
So, giving you an update now on the music side in production, I was now syncing with Richard daily and we would provide him, I'd provide him with a full video chapter.

509
00:33:23,050 --> 00:33:25,451
a walkthrough for every chapter in the game.

510
00:33:26,052 --> 00:33:29,993
I'd also include a Word doc that would use timestamps to reference events in the video

511
00:33:30,013 --> 00:33:34,995
where I would need music, like an establishing shot, a stinger, cutscenes, combat, etc.,

512
00:33:35,435 --> 00:33:36,976
along with my notes for all of this.

513
00:33:37,536 --> 00:33:42,198
And also included would be an Excel doc with additional info, the song naming, estimated

514
00:33:42,258 --> 00:33:46,500
time lengths, and I would give him all the cinematics as separate files so he could work

515
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:47,300
on them separately.

516
00:33:48,376 --> 00:33:56,066
So here's a bit of an idea of like a chapter eight where we had, uh, we have a whole, uh, sort of branching dialogue bit with a raker.

517
00:33:56,126 --> 00:34:01,013
So again, we have, you know, limited, like there's no time limit choice wheels and stuff.

518
00:34:01,053 --> 00:34:06,239
So I created flow charts to kind of tell, show them what I was thinking, and then we would discuss it.

519
00:34:06,300 --> 00:34:06,360
And.

520
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,964
You know, sometimes he would have a better alternative to suggest and we would go with that.

521
00:34:11,864 --> 00:34:21,993
But ultimately it's my job to sort of make it as easy for him to jump in and start scoring. And you could see like I would put timestamps with, you know, if there was notes needed I would give them the notes.

522
00:34:23,177 --> 00:34:26,902
And I would have an Excel sheet that would have the same timestamps as the word doc.

523
00:34:27,602 --> 00:34:32,168
Uh, if we had old naming that late was like laying around and it was legacy

524
00:34:32,208 --> 00:34:36,352
because the game expanded and, you know, we get new script names, we would have

525
00:34:36,372 --> 00:34:39,836
the new names here, we would track it here, what type of use it was the time.

526
00:34:40,856 --> 00:34:44,898
And just to show you, chapter eight, one of the biggest chapters had 90 music entries.

527
00:34:44,938 --> 00:34:49,620
Now, again, a lot of this is combat into combat, but every piece of music had to be tracked.

528
00:34:50,140 --> 00:34:53,302
And this number here is always what scared me.

529
00:34:53,322 --> 00:34:57,183
I knew we had 16 chapters, so roughly about 18 minutes per chapter.

530
00:34:57,203 --> 00:34:59,705
So anytime I saw this, it kept me up at night

531
00:34:59,725 --> 00:35:03,026
because I knew I had to pay back that debt somewhere down the game.

532
00:35:03,706 --> 00:35:05,147
So part of the fun and stress.

533
00:35:06,220 --> 00:35:11,223
So again, sticking with music, we also needed a 10 minute June E3 gameplay demo

534
00:35:11,243 --> 00:35:13,244
to be planned out and recorded back in early 2021.

535
00:35:14,625 --> 00:35:19,147
So for that, we knew we weren't planning on recording the final score

536
00:35:19,187 --> 00:35:20,208
until the end of June.

537
00:35:20,588 --> 00:35:23,350
So what we did is we recorded a small ensemble.

538
00:35:23,510 --> 00:35:26,451
We took all the music that was going to be in the demo

539
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:30,514
and we did a hybrid of MIDI and live instruments

540
00:35:30,554 --> 00:35:32,575
with the live instruments mixed more out front.

541
00:35:32,635 --> 00:35:33,815
So it felt more dynamic.

542
00:35:35,096 --> 00:35:40,784
We needed to have all the game music composed by mid-June as the recordings that Abby wrote were booked for the last two weeks of June.

543
00:35:41,525 --> 00:35:48,515
And July would be Richard mixing the recordings with Jake Jackson into 7.1 and quad mixes. The deadline for all these deliveries was August 1st.

544
00:35:50,230 --> 00:35:54,873
So just the last thing to show you how busy we were, it was crazy, but we even found time.

545
00:35:55,293 --> 00:35:58,035
Every now and then you just have to sort of make room for something.

546
00:35:59,096 --> 00:36:04,879
At the request of one of the writers, she asked if we could write this Catatheon war song for Drax and the Guardians to sing.

547
00:36:04,939 --> 00:36:08,261
She just gave us Catatheon lyrics and we ran with it.

548
00:36:08,321 --> 00:36:10,822
And I said to Richard, I don't know, something stoic.

549
00:36:10,862 --> 00:36:14,485
And I gave him like the old Soviet Union anthem as my reference.

550
00:36:14,525 --> 00:36:15,565
And here's what we came up with.

551
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:26,814
Pell Muffin Sardouth, Judd Kynagol Tau, Goth and Kogal Mok.

552
00:36:27,614 --> 00:36:36,564
Pell Muffin Sardouth, Judd Kynagol Tau, Goth and Kogal Mok.

553
00:36:39,468 --> 00:36:40,749
Pretty funny, so there you go.

554
00:36:41,350 --> 00:36:42,951
So I'm now gonna welcome Richard Jakes

555
00:36:43,271 --> 00:36:44,732
to share some of his insights

556
00:36:44,792 --> 00:36:47,434
and let him take you through some of the stuff

557
00:36:47,454 --> 00:36:48,154
that he was doing.

558
00:36:48,714 --> 00:36:48,955
Richard.

559
00:36:50,272 --> 00:36:53,934
Thanks a lot Steve and hello everyone. I'm going to talk a little bit about the score

560
00:36:53,954 --> 00:36:58,497
for the game. So as previously mentioned we wanted to utilise leitmotif throughout the

561
00:36:58,557 --> 00:37:03,280
score to represent the various characters and narrative settings of the game. And the

562
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:07,143
first theme I wrote was for the Guardians themselves which we simply called the Hero

563
00:37:07,183 --> 00:37:13,427
Theme. This theme creates a sense of exploration throughout the galaxy but also a sense of

564
00:37:13,587 --> 00:37:19,611
heroism and not taking itself too seriously as you would expect from these bunch of misfits.

565
00:37:19,972 --> 00:37:24,374
Let's have a listen to the main theme now, which is in MIDI format, created in my studio

566
00:37:24,454 --> 00:37:25,454
using virtual instruments.

567
00:37:52,918 --> 00:37:56,621
As well as all the themes in the game, I wanted to use underscore, especially for when the

568
00:37:56,681 --> 00:38:02,907
player is traversing or exploring new areas. So here's an example of that in the forest

569
00:38:02,927 --> 00:38:05,770
of Second Half Nine, where we also use scripted events.

570
00:38:25,476 --> 00:38:28,885
Nowhere is a particular section of the game that the player will visit.

571
00:38:29,025 --> 00:38:31,612
In this level there are loads of bars and clubs.

572
00:38:53,274 --> 00:38:55,157
So, you want us to bring them back here?

573
00:38:55,177 --> 00:38:57,040
Not necessary.

574
00:38:57,341 --> 00:39:00,126
Enjoy the wonders of the Emporium.

575
00:39:00,827 --> 00:39:03,111
Commemorate your visit with a unique...

576
00:39:20,416 --> 00:39:26,561
In the puzzle section of the game, the player will use Star Lord's visor to help solve the puzzle and look around the environments.

577
00:39:27,402 --> 00:39:35,509
Musically I wanted to do something different here, so when you're not using the visor, the music is more organic and orchestral, but when you're in the visor...

578
00:39:42,596 --> 00:39:45,360
Perhaps the Nova Killer knows how to redirect these machines.

579
00:39:45,420 --> 00:39:46,562
She has experience.

580
00:39:47,002 --> 00:39:49,706
I was an assassin, not a saboteur.

581
00:39:50,087 --> 00:39:51,689
Same results either way, right?

582
00:39:52,711 --> 00:39:54,273
Looks like the wall's weak here.

583
00:39:54,293 --> 00:39:57,798
Drax, I need a hole here to reach the grid.

584
00:39:58,239 --> 00:39:59,120
And you will have one.

585
00:40:03,203 --> 00:40:06,726
Player choice is a big part of the game and there are some sections that are a lot more

586
00:40:06,746 --> 00:40:09,689
emotional than others, especially with branching dialogue trees.

587
00:40:10,189 --> 00:40:14,853
The way I scored this was to use a lot of flowcharts and diagrams to aid me in creating

588
00:40:15,194 --> 00:40:16,935
the appropriate music for all the branches.

589
00:40:17,576 --> 00:40:20,018
Here's a short example of some of this music in context.

590
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:29,586
So, uh, this is the thing you had to do?

591
00:40:31,112 --> 00:40:33,052
Come to the observation deck to look at the rift?

592
00:40:34,213 --> 00:40:34,493
No.

593
00:40:36,554 --> 00:40:38,414
I came to honor the memory of my family.

594
00:40:40,175 --> 00:40:41,416
That died without meaning...

595
00:40:41,436 --> 00:40:43,636
...or honor.

596
00:40:46,097 --> 00:40:49,059
I think I know what you mean, man.

597
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:51,660
My mom, when the, uh...

598
00:40:52,780 --> 00:40:53,460
...Shatara came.

599
00:40:56,702 --> 00:40:58,042
She also died for no reason.

600
00:41:05,606 --> 00:41:09,068
Working in the pandemic was never going to be easy, but social distancing

601
00:41:09,108 --> 00:41:13,870
presented its own set of challenges, especially with regards to recording. We

602
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:17,752
were not able to have the maximum amount of players in any one room at any one

603
00:41:17,832 --> 00:41:22,674
time because we had to have a minimum of two meter distance between them. Here's

604
00:41:22,694 --> 00:41:25,695
an example with the choir where we would normally have around 35 or 40 singers.

605
00:41:31,483 --> 00:41:34,345
What we had to do was layer them up and multi-track them.

606
00:41:35,005 --> 00:41:37,066
So if you have a look at this mic chart from Abbey Road,

607
00:41:37,106 --> 00:41:39,888
you can see the social distancing has been taken into account.

608
00:41:40,549 --> 00:41:42,950
And now let's have a listen to the second pass of the choir,

609
00:41:43,611 --> 00:41:47,013
hearing the first pass as well, given the effect of 32 voices.

610
00:41:48,254 --> 00:41:48,894
Choir singing.

611
00:41:59,184 --> 00:42:01,705
And now let's have a listen to the finish cue in-game.

612
00:42:20,390 --> 00:42:24,813
Once we finished the recordings, we knew the mix would be both complex and large due to

613
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:28,055
the number of tracks we'd had to record due to social distancing.

614
00:42:28,636 --> 00:42:33,459
So we recorded the mix in Pro Tools using three HDX cards and around 700 tracks.

615
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:40,865
This is because we were mixing in 7.1, so in each Pro Tools session we had 8 7.1 stems,

616
00:42:41,185 --> 00:42:45,369
so for example strings, brass, wind, choir, and a 7.1 master track,

617
00:42:45,749 --> 00:42:50,913
and we also had 8 stereos, brass, wind, choir, etc, plus a stereo master,

618
00:42:51,493 --> 00:42:53,495
using a lot of bussing and VCA's.

619
00:42:54,116 --> 00:42:58,459
So in any one pass we could bounce out every single asset for the game that we needed,

620
00:42:58,799 --> 00:43:00,381
and for the soundtrack at the same time.

621
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:03,903
You can hear the main theme here, and have a look through the Pro Tools session.

622
00:43:31,734 --> 00:43:37,119
As well as composing the score, I'm also responsible for recording, budgeting, scheduling, and I

623
00:43:37,159 --> 00:43:41,803
needed a team of people behind me to assist with these tasks. So I had a team of 11 copyists

624
00:43:41,843 --> 00:43:46,266
who were working in Sibelius preparing the music to take to the studio, and I also had

625
00:43:46,306 --> 00:43:50,049
an assistant on the project who was invaluable. So my advice is always to get a good team

626
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:52,331
of people around you and learn to delegate tasks.

627
00:43:53,352 --> 00:43:55,114
Thanks for watching, and I'll hand you back to Steve.

628
00:43:56,295 --> 00:43:56,975
Thank you, Richard.

629
00:43:57,989 --> 00:44:02,352
So closing out production now, giving you a few last bits of information.

630
00:44:02,412 --> 00:44:04,634
The Star-Lord band, the album was completed.

631
00:44:04,674 --> 00:44:08,057
The last track was written and recorded with Zero to Hero in January, 2021.

632
00:44:09,799 --> 00:44:13,142
And Zero actually replaced Space Riders as the opening song.

633
00:44:13,162 --> 00:44:15,764
So up until that point, it was always Space Riders.

634
00:44:15,984 --> 00:44:19,247
The sad thing was, is that we now replaced the song.

635
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:21,229
So we had to change the key of the opening.

636
00:44:21,269 --> 00:44:24,091
So it meant Richard had to go back and transpose that.

637
00:44:24,151 --> 00:44:25,452
But, you know, it's rock and roll.

638
00:44:26,497 --> 00:44:35,801
We also have managed to, through Randy, connect with Rolling Stone and get them to lend us the fonts and everything to include a Rolling Stone magazine.

639
00:44:35,841 --> 00:44:45,665
And what was really cool is we actually did a mock interview with one of their writers that you can read, and he did a mock review of the album that we provided him.

640
00:44:46,126 --> 00:44:49,627
So, it just shows you like we really went deep and trying to create.

641
00:44:50,755 --> 00:44:54,496
The lore behind the Star Lord band and just enrich the experience for the player.

642
00:44:55,337 --> 00:44:59,598
So now it's the finale, our final destination, and we're basically going to look at the mix.

643
00:45:00,478 --> 00:45:03,259
We knew we needed to surround ourselves with experts for the mix.

644
00:45:04,559 --> 00:45:09,360
It was a very challenging game to mix. There's five main characters who speak and need to be

645
00:45:09,420 --> 00:45:14,561
heard at all times. There's multiple weapon sound effects from the Guardians as well as

646
00:45:14,641 --> 00:45:17,522
their enemies. There's an epic score we want to hear.

647
00:45:18,539 --> 00:45:21,462
In-game sound effects like foley explosions, etc.

648
00:45:22,383 --> 00:45:24,805
As well as important gameplay UI sound effects.

649
00:45:25,226 --> 00:45:28,890
So that's a lot of stuff that you got to be able to hear all of it clearly.

650
00:45:30,571 --> 00:45:32,854
We met with a bunch of post-production facilities,

651
00:45:32,914 --> 00:45:36,437
but in the end we decided on Molinare Studios in Soho, UK.

652
00:45:37,038 --> 00:45:38,299
And it couldn't have been a better choice.

653
00:45:39,350 --> 00:45:43,192
One of my requests was for them to provide us someone with mix experience to help us

654
00:45:43,632 --> 00:45:48,254
because we get to mix a game every four or five years and this was going to be huge.

655
00:45:49,295 --> 00:45:52,696
So we were fortunate enough that they paired us with Mr. Richard Pryke.

656
00:45:53,217 --> 00:45:57,139
And if you're not familiar with Mr. Richard Pryke, him and his team won an Oscar for mixing

657
00:45:57,199 --> 00:45:58,259
Slumdog Millionaire.

658
00:45:58,339 --> 00:46:00,140
So we were in great company.

659
00:46:00,340 --> 00:46:03,362
And again, I tried to be a sponge and just learn as much as I could.

660
00:46:04,497 --> 00:46:11,103
So on August 5th, Armed with Richard's Mixes, we left for the UK and our return date was set for Saturday, August 28th.

661
00:46:12,524 --> 00:46:18,349
And on August, on arrival, we had to quarantine for five days because we were still in the midst of the pandemic.

662
00:46:18,809 --> 00:46:22,712
So five days at the hotel, we had to go through multiple tests the whole time we were there.

663
00:46:23,833 --> 00:46:27,897
And we were released from quarantine on day five, but sadly, at the end of our day.

664
00:46:27,937 --> 00:46:31,359
So we were now one day behind on our Mix journey.

665
00:46:32,482 --> 00:46:38,587
So we made a schedule to get caught up and we did get caught up doing roughly 12 to 14 hour days.

666
00:46:39,087 --> 00:46:42,170
The game literally found its audio identity in London.

667
00:46:42,790 --> 00:46:46,293
There's a huge piece of London that rides with this game as far as I'm concerned.

668
00:46:46,913 --> 00:46:50,276
The audio landscape came to life. All the elements came together.

669
00:46:50,456 --> 00:46:54,719
I mean, I was sitting there in the mix room listening to it and I was hearing it for the first time,

670
00:46:54,779 --> 00:46:57,441
as I had always imagined it. And it was such a great feeling.

671
00:46:58,237 --> 00:47:02,760
So one thing was we had one map late in the game that musically it wasn't flowing well.

672
00:47:02,800 --> 00:47:07,444
It was just the dynamics weren't there. It was too, there was just too much music playing all

673
00:47:07,464 --> 00:47:13,189
the time. So JS, my technical director and I, we made a plan late at night. And then on the Sunday,

674
00:47:13,229 --> 00:47:18,413
I had Rich come over to my hotel and we sat, we made the plan. He sent over the music within

675
00:47:18,473 --> 00:47:20,075
two days. We sent it to Montreal.

676
00:47:20,913 --> 00:47:24,194
Basically about six days after we addressed, we had a problem.

677
00:47:24,234 --> 00:47:28,055
We had the new music integrated into the map and it was now stellar.

678
00:47:28,535 --> 00:47:31,056
So it just shows you, you know, like the pace we were keeping.

679
00:47:31,576 --> 00:47:35,617
So we returned back from London to Montreal, exhausted, but feeling victorious.

680
00:47:35,657 --> 00:47:37,417
We felt we had really delivered the goods.

681
00:47:38,457 --> 00:47:39,698
So finale back home.

682
00:47:39,938 --> 00:47:43,419
When we got back home, we recorded a video actually for zero to hero that

683
00:47:43,459 --> 00:47:45,239
you could see on YouTube or wherever.

684
00:47:46,186 --> 00:47:52,128
The songs from the album became a strong marketing asset used in most of the trailers, which was advantageous to the marketing team.

685
00:47:53,189 --> 00:47:59,151
And currently, as a side note, the songs have over a million listens on Spotify, which as a musician still blows my mind.

686
00:47:59,211 --> 00:48:02,152
And, you know, it's something I can't really grasp.

687
00:48:03,711 --> 00:48:08,194
The last mile. So when we got back from the UK, there was five weeks left.

688
00:48:08,294 --> 00:48:10,836
When we returned, we spent it on playing the game all the time.

689
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:15,899
Final checks on all areas, audio bug fixes, as well as adding some small and final polishes.

690
00:48:16,619 --> 00:48:22,483
I worked with marketing and Joen Boudreau to mix and sound design all the trailers for the game during these last months.

691
00:48:23,563 --> 00:48:29,607
And in the end, we delivered five hours of score, plus two hours of licensed music.

692
00:48:30,665 --> 00:48:33,229
plus a 10 song original rock album,

693
00:48:34,110 --> 00:48:36,053
totaling over eight hours of music.

694
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,478
So to me, we definitely succeeded in providing

695
00:48:39,498 --> 00:48:41,801
a huge bang for our buck for our player.

696
00:48:42,903 --> 00:48:43,864
Not to mention all the,

697
00:48:43,964 --> 00:48:46,608
probably about eight alien languages created as well.

698
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:59,478
So my closing thoughts this is a quote from an interview I did in the UK that I barely remembered because I was just tired and it was early in the morning. And when I read it I was like wow that's really cool, you know, I can't believe I said that, but

699
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:03,244
there couldn't be truer words spoken when you surround yourself with the right people.

700
00:49:03,885 --> 00:49:07,766
The confidence kind of outweighs the pressure, and that was taken from an NME article.

701
00:49:08,486 --> 00:49:10,567
And that's right, and that's exactly what I did.

702
00:49:10,587 --> 00:49:13,368
I mean, I'm not going to lie, there was huge pressure to deliver this game,

703
00:49:13,488 --> 00:49:18,730
but every step of the way I was surrounding myself where I had weaknesses with strengths,

704
00:49:18,770 --> 00:49:21,571
whether it was Richard Jakes, whether it was Randy Eckhart,

705
00:49:21,611 --> 00:49:24,852
whether it was Yoan Boudreau for the Star-Lord album and mixes,

706
00:49:24,912 --> 00:49:27,933
whether it was Sébastien Kureto for the Monster People.

707
00:49:28,970 --> 00:49:30,631
Surround yourself with experts.

708
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:36,234
It's the best and most foolproof way, I think, to get yourself to the finish

709
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,634
line and accomplish your vision.

710
00:49:38,395 --> 00:49:42,376
Take time to experiment and look for ways to push audio more into design.

711
00:49:42,797 --> 00:49:44,077
We have to be proactive.

712
00:49:44,137 --> 00:49:47,158
We have to look for ways like I did for those X factors.

713
00:49:48,059 --> 00:49:50,940
And most importantly, be proactive, propose ideas.

714
00:49:51,340 --> 00:49:52,141
Don't sit back.

715
00:49:52,221 --> 00:49:55,762
Nobody's going to walk up to anybody's desk and say, Hey, you know, we're

716
00:49:55,802 --> 00:49:58,143
waiting for you to come forward with a great idea.

717
00:49:58,847 --> 00:50:02,049
You have to find these ideas and then try and sell them to people.

718
00:50:02,309 --> 00:50:05,952
And that's how you kind of get audio more out of the background and into the forefront.

719
00:50:06,332 --> 00:50:08,694
And finally, surround yourself with experts.

720
00:50:08,754 --> 00:50:09,835
I can't stress it enough.

721
00:50:09,935 --> 00:50:12,998
It's probably what helped me achieve this vision the most.

722
00:50:14,328 --> 00:50:14,929
So that's it.

723
00:50:15,249 --> 00:50:17,711
I want to thank you all for your time and your patience.

724
00:50:18,751 --> 00:50:20,412
On LinkedIn, if you want to connect with me,

725
00:50:20,472 --> 00:50:21,453
it's Steve Shipkowski.

726
00:50:22,393 --> 00:50:25,935
On Twitter, at Sheprock99, I'd be happy to meet and talk

727
00:50:25,976 --> 00:50:26,456
with any of you.

728
00:50:26,736 --> 00:50:30,318
In fact, I'll see if I can set up a small Zoom group

729
00:50:30,358 --> 00:50:32,920
for after this, if people want to come in a room

730
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,781
and hang out and ask some questions or talk,

731
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:36,122
I'm happy to do it.

732
00:50:36,162 --> 00:50:38,403
So I'm happy to take any Q&A right now,

733
00:50:38,463 --> 00:50:40,004
if anybody has any questions.

734
00:50:47,511 --> 00:50:48,151
Thank you very much.

735
00:50:49,531 --> 00:50:49,952
Hey Steve.

736
00:50:49,972 --> 00:50:50,072
Hey.

737
00:50:50,532 --> 00:50:53,953
I also want to hear about the audio journey and hear it from start to finish.

738
00:50:53,973 --> 00:50:54,793
Thank you.

739
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:58,434
I had a question about the recording stems, the orchestra recording.

740
00:50:58,954 --> 00:51:02,675
Did you split the orchestra recording up by strings, brass, percussion?

741
00:51:02,815 --> 00:51:07,896
Or what was your methodology for the stem recording and the reason, meaning for implementation

742
00:51:07,956 --> 00:51:09,537
purposes or rather mixing purposes?

743
00:51:10,692 --> 00:51:13,332
Um, so Richard delivered all the mixes.

744
00:51:13,372 --> 00:51:17,033
I mean, he would have been a better person to give you the final, uh, how

745
00:51:17,113 --> 00:51:22,095
everything was put together, but we did ask for 7.1, uh, STEM.

746
00:51:22,155 --> 00:51:25,795
So it was basically like the strings, the brass, the perks and everything.

747
00:51:25,875 --> 00:51:30,977
I can't remember all of it right now, but we went with 7.1 for all the cut

748
00:51:31,017 --> 00:51:34,138
scenes and in game was always quad ambiences.

749
00:51:34,638 --> 00:51:34,898
Okay.

750
00:51:34,938 --> 00:51:35,178
Awesome.

751
00:51:35,837 --> 00:51:45,886
And it sounded like, I know you mentioned you did for the June E3 demo a hybrid orchestration where you're blending virtual and live elements.

752
00:51:45,926 --> 00:51:52,611
For the final, did you end up using any of the virtual strings or brass to augment the live recordings or not so for that?

753
00:51:53,112 --> 00:51:58,076
Negative. All live, all real. There was nothing MIDI that went into the final game.

754
00:51:58,356 --> 00:51:59,077
Awesome. Cool.

755
00:51:59,197 --> 00:51:59,417
Yes.

756
00:52:00,097 --> 00:52:00,418
Thank you.

757
00:52:02,574 --> 00:52:05,835
Hey Steve, how you doing? That was interesting information there.

758
00:52:06,495 --> 00:52:07,195
Great, thank you.

759
00:52:07,876 --> 00:52:11,437
Yeah, in your experience dealing with the legal and licensing aspect,

760
00:52:11,857 --> 00:52:14,298
and all of that knowledge base I'm sure you acquired,

761
00:52:14,318 --> 00:52:16,918
I had a question just kind of pertaining to ownership

762
00:52:17,639 --> 00:52:21,960
when you're creating original compositions for a game project.

763
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:25,201
So like the Star Lord band stuff now you mean?

764
00:52:26,581 --> 00:52:30,763
Yeah, yeah, like anything that you actually created, not necessarily the licensed songs.

765
00:52:30,783 --> 00:52:34,285
Yeah, because the licensed music, I mean the ownership stays with the writers and all that,

766
00:52:34,325 --> 00:52:40,968
but the Star-Lord band was something that basically was part of the game delivery.

767
00:52:41,028 --> 00:52:45,810
So, you know, Disney, I was able to keep writing credits and all that,

768
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:48,391
but at the end of the day it was part of the game that we delivered.

769
00:52:48,651 --> 00:52:49,932
to Disney Marvel.

770
00:52:50,253 --> 00:52:55,117
And that's pretty much a typical deal for something like that in the gaming industry.

771
00:52:55,558 --> 00:52:57,139
Generally, yes.

772
00:52:57,379 --> 00:52:58,340
Yeah, I would say so.

773
00:52:58,560 --> 00:52:59,802
No, that's perfect. I appreciate that.

774
00:53:00,362 --> 00:53:01,163
You're very welcome.

775
00:53:03,365 --> 00:53:04,706
Hi, thanks so much for the talk.

776
00:53:05,507 --> 00:53:06,188
You're very welcome.

777
00:53:06,428 --> 00:53:06,888
Nice to meet you.

778
00:53:07,517 --> 00:53:08,037
Hi, Dana.

779
00:53:09,138 --> 00:53:10,839
I had a question about the transitions

780
00:53:10,859 --> 00:53:13,061
you were talking about between the licensed music

781
00:53:13,081 --> 00:53:14,542
and the score, like the one you showed

782
00:53:14,562 --> 00:53:15,963
in the chapter one and chapter three.

783
00:53:16,343 --> 00:53:19,305
You said you guys had to do a lot of time manipulation

784
00:53:19,405 --> 00:53:21,427
to the songs to get it to work.

785
00:53:21,447 --> 00:53:21,927
Like, what was that?

786
00:53:21,947 --> 00:53:25,209
No, so actually what it was, that example

787
00:53:25,269 --> 00:53:29,092
was just for the one that I showed you for the hot chocolate.

788
00:53:29,112 --> 00:53:32,575
And because it was a long scene with, like I said,

789
00:53:32,615 --> 00:53:35,237
there's at least three or four choice wheels in that scene.

790
00:53:36,017 --> 00:53:40,581
So how do you, like, when you know you want to get the ending on that,

791
00:53:41,241 --> 00:53:46,105
how do you get to that ending where the train trip to here is going to change every time?

792
00:53:46,963 --> 00:53:52,564
So we had to get really creative and we did find obviously using loops in specific places

793
00:53:53,065 --> 00:53:58,226
and then bringing in the layer of just the ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba and then cut to stereo.

794
00:53:58,846 --> 00:54:01,127
We brought that in over the loop on a beat.

795
00:54:01,487 --> 00:54:06,489
So there's a lot of cheating going on but it actually sounds pretty seamless when you hear it.

796
00:54:07,069 --> 00:54:10,870
Yeah I guess that was kind of my question like if you guys were using loops and like editing and

797
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:15,991
stuff did you guys for like a lot of the lines of the music did you receive like any stems of them?

798
00:54:16,131 --> 00:54:16,251
No.

799
00:54:18,074 --> 00:54:25,658
Now, straight tracks and then, you know, obviously we had to respect all the legal stuff of, you know, manipulating songs.

800
00:54:25,738 --> 00:54:27,159
It gets tricky on what you can do.

801
00:54:27,199 --> 00:54:31,881
Like you can't start rearranging the song where it starts with a chorus and a verse.

802
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:32,481
You know what I mean?

803
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,903
So we had to still be careful.

804
00:54:34,943 --> 00:54:37,044
It wasn't like carte blanche, do whatever you want.

805
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:40,926
But we respected the song and it was just about making smart decisions.

806
00:54:40,966 --> 00:54:42,586
Like when it went into the music break.

807
00:54:43,525 --> 00:54:45,685
It's a long break, so you're able to kind of go,

808
00:54:45,805 --> 00:54:46,825
oh, well, there's a break here.

809
00:54:46,885 --> 00:54:48,586
We're not changing the structure of the song.

810
00:54:48,626 --> 00:54:51,946
We're actually just extending the break for let's say 64 bars

811
00:54:52,647 --> 00:54:54,647
instead of 16, you know what I mean?

812
00:54:55,347 --> 00:54:57,948
So just finding smart places where we could cheat.

813
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,348
And then, like I said, the ending part,

814
00:55:00,908 --> 00:55:02,849
that punch that takes you to the stereo,

815
00:55:03,349 --> 00:55:06,089
was actually a separate stem that we created

816
00:55:06,450 --> 00:55:09,070
that we just brought in over beat at the right time.

817
00:55:09,550 --> 00:55:10,890
If you listen to it isolated,

818
00:55:10,930 --> 00:55:12,771
you can kind of hear where it jerks a bit.

819
00:55:13,251 --> 00:55:17,194
But in the context of the game, when you're listening to the dialogue, it's seamless.

820
00:55:17,254 --> 00:55:19,376
And I was so happy with the result.

821
00:55:19,796 --> 00:55:21,317
Cool. Yeah. It sounds great. Thank you.

822
00:55:21,858 --> 00:55:22,619
Thank you so much.

823
00:55:22,639 --> 00:55:28,623
Hi. What a great story you've been telling through all of this.

824
00:55:29,664 --> 00:55:35,469
For the orchestra recording with five hours in it being fresh, as far as an ambition,

825
00:55:36,409 --> 00:55:39,572
what was one of the biggest surprises? Or if not a surprise,

826
00:55:39,732 --> 00:55:41,313
your biggest takeaway from that process?

827
00:55:42,655 --> 00:55:55,387
So my this might surprise you, but as a guy, like I said, you know, like, of course, I love film scores and John Williams and and, you know, all the the Morricone and all the spaghetti Westerns and all that.

828
00:55:56,028 --> 00:56:04,396
But what I learned was the power of a live orchestra I mean I've been to see like you know Metallica concerts and Motorhead, you know, kiss and all these bombastic shows.

829
00:56:05,807 --> 00:56:09,431
Live orchestra is the true heavy metal, as far as I'm concerned.

830
00:56:09,532 --> 00:56:14,057
Like there's, there's nothing more powerful than hearing a full orchestra

831
00:56:14,177 --> 00:56:19,503
playing some thematic, uh, piece of music that just, I mean, for me, it's changed

832
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:21,766
how I hear orchestrated music, you know?

833
00:56:22,366 --> 00:56:22,587
Excellent.

834
00:56:23,795 --> 00:56:44,915
That would be my biggest takeaway is just realizing how powerful a live orchestra is because I'd been hearing the MIDI tracks forever, and I've never worked with a live orchestra and I remember being like my bedrooms right above my recording studio I can remember waking up one morning and I'm hearing the orchestra through my pillow and I'm like, God, I'm listening to this game way too much and then I realized,

835
00:56:45,516 --> 00:56:51,141
Oh no, wait, I have my Abbey Roadstream still running from yesterday and I ran downstairs with my coffee.

836
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:55,505
So every day I would listen to the orchestra recordings because I couldn't fly down there.

837
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,187
The COVID was really high at the time.

838
00:56:57,650 --> 00:57:00,452
And I would have had to quarantine for two weeks and I couldn't give up the time.

839
00:57:01,012 --> 00:57:05,314
So just listen, like I would run down here with a coffee and just sit here and just

840
00:57:05,414 --> 00:57:10,797
listen for like three hours to just hear this, this to hear the music go from MIDI

841
00:57:10,837 --> 00:57:13,038
to live. I couldn't believe it.

842
00:57:13,058 --> 00:57:16,019
It's like going from A to B, just how impactful it was.

843
00:57:16,500 --> 00:57:17,280
Yeah, that's awesome.

844
00:57:17,820 --> 00:57:19,161
So, yeah, I learned I learned that.

845
00:57:20,381 --> 00:57:21,962
Thank you. You're very welcome.

846
00:57:32,818 --> 00:57:34,879
I can't really see if there's any other speakers.

847
00:57:35,320 --> 00:57:36,140
So if there's, if,

848
00:57:39,743 --> 00:57:41,524
but once again, I will say that, you know,

849
00:57:41,544 --> 00:57:44,046
this was a huge team effort and, you know,

850
00:57:44,226 --> 00:57:47,048
I get to sort of coordinate the chaos and build the team,

851
00:57:47,108 --> 00:57:48,168
but without these people,

852
00:57:48,589 --> 00:57:50,790
I wouldn't be standing here talking to you today for sure.

853
00:57:53,692 --> 00:57:56,494
So it goes back to my whole surround yourself with experts,

854
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:59,176
build an amazing team of people around you, you can trust.

855
00:58:00,024 --> 00:58:03,871
And yeah, you'll probably deliver exactly what you were hoping to deliver.
