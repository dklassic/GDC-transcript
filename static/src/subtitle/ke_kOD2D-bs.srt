1
00:00:05,795 --> 00:00:07,896
All right.

2
00:00:07,916 --> 00:00:11,737
Okay, Stone Labrandi, and creative director of Maxis.

3
00:00:11,817 --> 00:00:14,098
Also, as I just mentioned, the lead designer of SimCity.

4
00:00:14,238 --> 00:00:16,019
I've actually been working on that game for two years now,

5
00:00:16,099 --> 00:00:17,319
so for the last two GDCs,

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:19,960
I've had to hide that little bit off my slide.

7
00:00:20,621 --> 00:00:22,461
So it's nice to finally be able to come out and say that.

8
00:00:23,602 --> 00:00:25,102
I'm not gonna be talking about the game at all today,

9
00:00:25,242 --> 00:00:27,883
so I'm gonna be talking about not even EA or Maxis.

10
00:00:27,903 --> 00:00:30,584
I'm gonna be talking about my kind of side job

11
00:00:31,024 --> 00:00:32,465
that I have of teaching game design.

12
00:00:34,308 --> 00:00:38,070
So I want to start out with something that's not really game design. It's this great book,

13
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:42,892
Paper Engineering. And I had picked it up a while back. And what I really liked about

14
00:00:42,913 --> 00:00:49,916
this book was kind of the first page is, here's ten working models for how to make pop-ups.

15
00:00:50,537 --> 00:00:54,839
These are really simple. They're designed to be as simple as possible because he wants

16
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,842
to show you the mechanics, the structure behind how these things work. It kind of defeats

17
00:00:59,862 --> 00:01:01,242
the purpose if they were really complicated.

18
00:01:02,483 --> 00:01:04,924
The book's great, so there's a section for each one of these 10 models.

19
00:01:05,805 --> 00:01:09,346
And the best part of it, though, is that you actually build the models, and you can glue

20
00:01:09,366 --> 00:01:10,267
them back into the book.

21
00:01:10,427 --> 00:01:14,849
So as you're reading the book, you're making your own pop-up book at the same time.

22
00:01:15,649 --> 00:01:18,451
And it's just a really fun book to play with, but it's a great way to learn.

23
00:01:19,291 --> 00:01:21,693
And in a way, the games that I'm going to be talking about today,

24
00:01:22,213 --> 00:01:24,474
they're the equivalent of what you're seeing here.

25
00:01:25,035 --> 00:01:29,117
So, I designed a set of games that were meant to kind of lay bare

26
00:01:29,217 --> 00:01:31,619
the basic fundamentals of game design

27
00:01:32,019 --> 00:01:37,223
in a way that this little box lays bare the basics of this particular pop-up paper.

28
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:41,946
And then the series of games that I've made, you can think of it like the book, you know,

29
00:01:41,966 --> 00:01:45,048
that you put them all together and then when you run through that course, you would have

30
00:01:45,068 --> 00:01:46,689
a really good understanding of game design.

31
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:50,752
So for those of you in the audience who are full-time game designers who have been doing

32
00:01:50,772 --> 00:01:55,315
this a long time, the point of the talk is not really to say, oh, I'm going to teach

33
00:01:55,335 --> 00:01:57,056
you the fundamentals of game design, you already know them.

34
00:01:58,017 --> 00:02:01,780
What I am doing here is an extreme form of deconstruction

35
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,162
where I'm trying to remove everything possible from the game

36
00:02:05,242 --> 00:02:07,844
except the one idea that I want to communicate to the students.

37
00:02:08,465 --> 00:02:11,427
And it was a real fun, challenging design task,

38
00:02:12,027 --> 00:02:13,729
harder than I would think at first.

39
00:02:13,749 --> 00:02:15,190
It's like, oh, making something simple, that's easy.

40
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,892
It turns out sometimes making something simple is harder

41
00:02:17,932 --> 00:02:21,174
than making complex things where you can just keep throwing stuff onto it.

42
00:02:22,355 --> 00:02:24,017
So before I get into it, I'll talk.

43
00:02:24,737 --> 00:02:30,139
briefly about the overview and the class background and my philosophy of teaching that class,

44
00:02:31,459 --> 00:02:35,160
then a little bit about the fundamentals of game design. What are these things I'm trying to teach anyway?

45
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:38,661
If I don't know what the fundamentals are, it's hard to make games about them.

46
00:02:40,761 --> 00:02:43,942
Most of the talk, the majority of the talk, will be spent talking about the games themselves,

47
00:02:43,982 --> 00:02:48,503
so I'll kind of run through them all and describe to you how they worked,

48
00:02:48,703 --> 00:02:50,664
lessons I learned from building them,

49
00:02:50,764 --> 00:02:52,824
and then the lessons the students are supposed to learn from playing them.

50
00:02:54,173 --> 00:02:56,895
And then just a little quick final thoughts wrap up at the end.

51
00:02:58,776 --> 00:03:02,258
So I've been teaching classes for about 11 years now.

52
00:03:02,438 --> 00:03:06,900
I actually started teaching classes right before I first got my job at Blizzard.

53
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,183
So even before I was in the game design industry, I was teaching game design classes.

54
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:13,264
And that was like 2001.

55
00:03:14,185 --> 00:03:17,627
I started teaching at Cogswell Polytechnical College, which if you don't know,

56
00:03:17,687 --> 00:03:20,028
it's about 40 miles south down in Sunnyvale.

57
00:03:20,869 --> 00:03:21,569
It's a great school.

58
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:27,714
The Game Design Workshop, which Mark LeBlanc and a few of us run every Monday and Tuesday

59
00:03:27,734 --> 00:03:31,455
here at GDC, which looks like a lot of you have attended, and so you understand that

60
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:35,796
format. Game Connection in Paris, which is another event in Europe that they have. I've

61
00:03:35,836 --> 00:03:41,517
taught workshops there. And then at EA, I take the Maxis interns and I kind of run them

62
00:03:41,537 --> 00:03:43,478
through a little boot camp in the summer while they're there.

63
00:03:46,490 --> 00:03:49,272
The workshop itself, there's no electronics allowed.

64
00:03:49,572 --> 00:03:52,234
We do everything with paper and pencils and dice and cards.

65
00:03:52,835 --> 00:03:56,077
I've found that electronics are a huge distraction in

66
00:03:56,117 --> 00:03:56,718
making games.

67
00:03:56,898 --> 00:03:59,440
I don't really see the need for them when you're learning

68
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:00,341
the basics of games.

69
00:04:00,701 --> 00:04:02,322
You can learn everything you need with some dice and a deck

70
00:04:02,342 --> 00:04:06,165
of cards, and your pencil never crashes.

71
00:04:06,646 --> 00:04:07,807
It doesn't need software upgrades.

72
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:11,182
The workshops themselves are about two to three hours.

73
00:04:11,522 --> 00:04:13,724
A lot of times I'll be teaching these and it'll be time to go

74
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:14,424
and I'll want to leave.

75
00:04:14,484 --> 00:04:18,167
Like the Saturday class I teach is about five hours long

76
00:04:18,228 --> 00:04:19,829
and it's like taking my whole Saturday.

77
00:04:19,869 --> 00:04:21,110
I was like, I just want to go home.

78
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:22,891
And they're like, no, we need to play this game some more.

79
00:04:23,672 --> 00:04:25,614
So that's always a big win when that happens.

80
00:04:25,954 --> 00:04:27,395
Then you know you're on to something if they just want to

81
00:04:27,415 --> 00:04:28,636
keep playing the game that they built.

82
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,579
Like I mentioned, they focus on one specific topic.

83
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,901
And you'll see that as we go through here.

84
00:04:36,685 --> 00:04:41,669
and no grades. I don't grade these things. So even though it's a class and they are getting a grade for the whole class,

85
00:04:42,029 --> 00:04:46,772
when they do one of these exercises, the point isn't to say, oh, you did good at the exercise, you get an A, and you did bad, you get a B.

86
00:04:47,853 --> 00:04:52,616
Instead, it's just you showed up, you participated, so you're going to get the credit for that day.

87
00:04:53,754 --> 00:04:55,975
but it's kind of important, but there are winners.

88
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,755
So it's like you don't get a grade, but you won.

89
00:04:58,415 --> 00:04:59,176
So you're pretty awesome.

90
00:05:00,116 --> 00:05:03,277
And that, what I found, is that little bit of competition,

91
00:05:03,717 --> 00:05:06,358
it gets the students engaged in the game in a way,

92
00:05:06,398 --> 00:05:08,578
like I don't want them floating above it like a game designer

93
00:05:08,618 --> 00:05:09,438
and analyzing it.

94
00:05:09,738 --> 00:05:11,919
I want them down in it, so they're actually feeling

95
00:05:12,499 --> 00:05:13,940
the emotions that the players would feel

96
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:14,660
while they're playing it.

97
00:05:14,980 --> 00:05:17,500
And the way, the simple way to do that is I just egg them on.

98
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,021
I'm like, oh, who's winning over here?

99
00:05:19,281 --> 00:05:20,481
Who's going to get the award at the end?

100
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,201
Who's doing the best?

101
00:05:22,182 --> 00:05:24,245
And I really try to like encourage them to fight each other.

102
00:05:24,866 --> 00:05:27,030
And it actually makes the games a lot more emotionally charged.

103
00:05:27,350 --> 00:05:29,733
And then afterwards, then we can talk about the emotions they felt

104
00:05:30,535 --> 00:05:31,917
because they were down in there with them.

105
00:05:33,735 --> 00:05:36,837
All right, so before I get into the main games, I want to talk about this first day game,

106
00:05:36,857 --> 00:05:37,957
when they first show up to class.

107
00:05:38,658 --> 00:05:42,940
And I'm not, at this point, trying to teach any design goals for this first one.

108
00:05:43,901 --> 00:05:46,062
What I'm trying to do is just say, hey, this is an icebreaker.

109
00:05:46,883 --> 00:05:48,224
Let's get to know each other.

110
00:05:48,284 --> 00:05:49,624
I need to know their personalities.

111
00:05:49,664 --> 00:05:53,727
There's always, in the class, there's always that one guy who knows everything about games already.

112
00:05:54,447 --> 00:05:56,088
And so he just comes in with this huge knowledge.

113
00:05:56,308 --> 00:05:58,948
And then there's a guy who's, you know, the person's more quiet and subdued,

114
00:05:59,008 --> 00:06:00,428
and you try to get them balanced out.

115
00:06:00,488 --> 00:06:04,129
And I try to get a mental read on who's who so I can know who to control

116
00:06:04,189 --> 00:06:05,649
and who to try to boost up a little bit.

117
00:06:07,509 --> 00:06:10,910
This first game, it's more I want to get them active.

118
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,211
I don't want them sitting there looking at a board and getting analysis paralysis

119
00:06:14,271 --> 00:06:17,271
and at some kind of exercise, whether just not talking

120
00:06:17,291 --> 00:06:18,731
or communicating everything's in their head.

121
00:06:18,931 --> 00:06:21,152
Instead, I want to get everything out into the room as big as possible

122
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,012
and just make a lot of noise and get them moving around.

123
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,443
and then it really just set a tone for the semesters.

124
00:06:26,463 --> 00:06:28,945
Like this class is not one where I'm going to stand up in front

125
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:32,328
of the whiteboard and lecture to you while you take notes.

126
00:06:32,689 --> 00:06:34,751
Like you better, like you're going to get up,

127
00:06:34,791 --> 00:06:36,472
you're going to be moving around,

128
00:06:36,552 --> 00:06:38,794
you're going to really be an active participant of this class.

129
00:06:40,333 --> 00:06:43,574
So here's the, kind of the first day thing. I was like, get up, get out of your desks,

130
00:06:43,594 --> 00:06:49,577
get out of your seats. And this board, the board, the floor, is a nice checkerboard tiled

131
00:06:49,757 --> 00:06:55,839
floor. You can kind of see it there. So you are the pieces. This is your board. Make a

132
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:56,639
game out of this room.

133
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:02,021
and they can do whatever they want. It's totally wide open, and usually somebody will like,

134
00:07:02,501 --> 00:07:06,122
how do we move? It's like, okay, you ask the question, you have to tell me. Right now,

135
00:07:06,202 --> 00:07:08,942
tell me how you're going to move. And then he has to make up something on the spot, like,

136
00:07:08,962 --> 00:07:12,603
you can only move one square. Well, can we move diagonal? Oh, you asked the question,

137
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:16,584
can you move diagonal? And I let them build the game basically by asking questions about

138
00:07:16,624 --> 00:07:20,745
what they can do next, and whoever asks the question has to answer it right away. So it's

139
00:07:20,805 --> 00:07:26,546
very fluid, very free form. In this particular class, this was a great one, you can kind of see

140
00:07:27,347 --> 00:07:31,830
Thank you, my laser pointer. This curtain over here, it's one of those folding accordion curtains that separates a room in two.

141
00:07:32,331 --> 00:07:38,376
So they closed it, they divided the class into two groups, and they made a capture the flag where they built their own base in secret.

142
00:07:39,016 --> 00:07:42,579
And they tore up the whole room, stacked all the desks.

143
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:49,045
And this is great because I teach the class on Saturday, there's almost no one else in the school, and I completely take advantage of that fact.

144
00:07:49,165 --> 00:07:55,510
So we tear everything up, we go into all the different rooms, and we make the whole school into the classroom and hope nobody walks in.

145
00:07:57,027 --> 00:08:01,908
They, you know, tear it up. Here they open up the curtains, and you can kind of see at

146
00:08:01,928 --> 00:08:07,989
this point their mazes, their little territories get linked together. This particular game,

147
00:08:08,009 --> 00:08:11,650
they had to roll dice, and you try to get it into that player's square. And it started

148
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:15,231
out with just everybody had one die. They knew they'd probably roll a five or six, but

149
00:08:15,471 --> 00:08:18,432
that wasn't exciting enough. And by the end of the exercise, we had a coffee can full

150
00:08:18,452 --> 00:08:22,453
of dice that were all over the room. So they had the shotgun attack, where you could, like,

151
00:08:22,833 --> 00:08:25,753
grab as many dice in a hand as you can and just throw them across the room.

152
00:08:26,774 --> 00:08:28,775
But there's friendly fire, so you have to watch out for that.

153
00:08:30,617 --> 00:08:35,180
So this is a great example of kind of an icebreaker game,

154
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,382
but it's also when I first started teaching this class,

155
00:08:37,922 --> 00:08:38,983
all my games were like this.

156
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,024
It's like, get up and here's a box of cool stuff,

157
00:08:41,064 --> 00:08:42,505
and go out there and make games out of it.

158
00:08:43,086 --> 00:08:44,707
And I would give a lecture about some topic.

159
00:08:45,127 --> 00:08:49,391
and say, try to follow that topic in your exercise.

160
00:08:49,731 --> 00:08:51,232
And sometimes they would, and sometimes they wouldn't.

161
00:08:51,352 --> 00:08:53,794
But because their creativity, the problem space,

162
00:08:54,335 --> 00:08:55,756
was, even though I constrained it,

163
00:08:56,156 --> 00:08:57,397
they had so much to work with.

164
00:08:57,417 --> 00:08:58,979
They had too much creative freedom, basically.

165
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:00,800
So I started constraining.

166
00:09:00,840 --> 00:09:02,141
It's like, no, don't do that, don't do that.

167
00:09:02,241 --> 00:09:04,003
And that's kind of how I got to the games

168
00:09:04,023 --> 00:09:06,124
that I'll be showing you, where it's like just removing stuff

169
00:09:06,164 --> 00:09:08,967
to get them to really focus on what I wanted them to focus on.

170
00:09:10,257 --> 00:09:12,359
So, you know, before I could do this, there's a question like,

171
00:09:12,379 --> 00:09:14,320
well, what is a game? I'm going to teach you game design,

172
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:17,744
but how do I teach you game design if I don't really know what a game is?

173
00:09:17,824 --> 00:09:20,166
And when you ask the students what is a game, they can't tell you.

174
00:09:21,067 --> 00:09:22,948
They don't know. They're not academics.

175
00:09:22,988 --> 00:09:25,210
They don't study this stuff like a lot of us in this audience do.

176
00:09:26,211 --> 00:09:28,734
And actually, when I first started teaching, I didn't study this stuff either.

177
00:09:28,954 --> 00:09:31,096
I had no idea what a game was. I couldn't define it myself.

178
00:09:31,696 --> 00:09:35,499
The reason that I taught game design was because I've been making games ever since I was a kid,

179
00:09:35,539 --> 00:09:38,081
and I'm like, oh, I'm going to be great at teaching game design because I make games.

180
00:09:38,501 --> 00:09:41,623
But it turns out, when I was really trying to fill up that 15-week syllabus,

181
00:09:41,643 --> 00:09:45,466
it's like, wow, I can only do like two classes, and I'm drained of all my knowledge.

182
00:09:45,746 --> 00:09:46,806
This isn't going to work very well.

183
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:50,149
So where's the sources back in 2001?

184
00:09:50,229 --> 00:09:52,330
There wasn't really a lot of game design classes back then.

185
00:09:52,350 --> 00:09:54,912
There was no textbooks. The Rules of Play book wasn't out yet.

186
00:09:54,952 --> 00:09:59,075
A lot of these books that we see now all the time didn't even exist back then.

187
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,896
But I was a huge fan of Magic Cards,

188
00:10:02,717 --> 00:10:04,718
and there was a magazine called The Duelist Magazine,

189
00:10:04,738 --> 00:10:07,039
which if you played Magic Cards back then, you may have seen it.

190
00:10:07,499 --> 00:10:09,741
And Richard Garfield, the creator of Magic Cards,

191
00:10:09,801 --> 00:10:12,422
wrote the back page column called Lost in the Shuffle.

192
00:10:13,102 --> 00:10:14,663
So I had a stack of these magazines,

193
00:10:14,683 --> 00:10:16,624
and I'm like, this is great, this is my curriculum right here.

194
00:10:16,644 --> 00:10:18,185
I'll just pull 15 of these articles,

195
00:10:18,545 --> 00:10:20,026
and I'll teach one of Richard Garfield's

196
00:10:20,706 --> 00:10:22,627
back of the magazine lessons every week,

197
00:10:22,647 --> 00:10:24,388
and I'll get through the whole program,

198
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:25,349
and that didn't work either.

199
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,611
But it gave me a lot of cool things to think about.

200
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,716
Read through the Art of Computer Game Design by Chris Crawford,

201
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:32,877
which I'm sure many of you have read.

202
00:10:33,558 --> 00:10:34,619
And that one is pretty good.

203
00:10:34,659 --> 00:10:37,882
It's more focused a little more on computer game design,

204
00:10:38,423 --> 00:10:40,025
and I didn't really want to teach computer game design.

205
00:10:40,045 --> 00:10:42,267
But there are some sections in there about just games in general,

206
00:10:42,387 --> 00:10:43,408
which I thought was really helpful.

207
00:10:44,269 --> 00:10:47,211
But the main one I found was Greg Casticchian's

208
00:10:47,571 --> 00:10:48,952
I Have No Words and I Must Design.

209
00:10:49,553 --> 00:10:50,894
So if you're familiar with this essay,

210
00:10:51,834 --> 00:10:53,576
it's just a really great way of just breaking down

211
00:10:53,956 --> 00:10:55,036
games to the fundamental.

212
00:10:55,337 --> 00:10:57,878
And it's not just electronic games.

213
00:10:57,918 --> 00:10:58,559
It's every game.

214
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,401
It's all the way from, you know, hide and seek to chess

215
00:11:01,621 --> 00:11:03,942
and from, you know, games like Battlefield

216
00:11:04,023 --> 00:11:05,944
and sports games like basketball, things like that.

217
00:11:06,264 --> 00:11:07,205
So you can break them all down.

218
00:11:07,245 --> 00:11:09,987
And so this really became my structure

219
00:11:10,107 --> 00:11:11,928
that I really kind of latched on to.

220
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:13,129
I really liked the way that it was written.

221
00:11:13,969 --> 00:11:20,653
But if you've been to some of my previous talks, you know that I'm not really a big fan of gigantic essays with lots of words and text and no drawings in them.

222
00:11:21,174 --> 00:11:25,396
So I wanted to make my equivalent of like, what's the one-page design of Greg's essay?

223
00:11:26,297 --> 00:11:30,260
So I started kind of like breaking it down into a simple drawing that I could give to my students.

224
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,962
You know, actually what I found in the first few classes, I actually tried to get them to read this thing.

225
00:11:34,222 --> 00:11:36,163
And they would say, did you read it? And they would all say yes.

226
00:11:36,203 --> 00:11:38,305
But then you ask them questions and you realize they were just saying yes.

227
00:11:38,345 --> 00:11:39,445
They hadn't really read it anyway.

228
00:11:40,586 --> 00:11:41,947
And we all know what that's like if you're a student.

229
00:11:42,979 --> 00:11:45,621
So what are the fundamentals of game design?

230
00:11:46,682 --> 00:11:48,463
What is my one-page drawing of this

231
00:11:48,503 --> 00:11:49,984
that I could just draw on the whiteboard really quickly

232
00:11:50,024 --> 00:11:50,965
to get the idea across?

233
00:11:51,706 --> 00:11:52,486
So you start out.

234
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:53,727
There's a start condition.

235
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:55,789
You travel for some distance.

236
00:11:55,829 --> 00:11:56,530
You get to a goal.

237
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,912
And that's pretty obvious.

238
00:11:59,132 --> 00:12:00,613
But if that's all that was to it,

239
00:12:00,713 --> 00:12:03,215
I could make a game right now, which is let's play this game.

240
00:12:03,495 --> 00:12:05,417
Everybody sit in the chair they're sitting in right now.

241
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:06,638
You all win.

242
00:12:06,918 --> 00:12:07,299
Very good.

243
00:12:07,339 --> 00:12:07,899
Thanks for playing.

244
00:12:09,745 --> 00:12:14,189
Not very interesting. So we add some opposition in the way. This is what Greg would call struggle.

245
00:12:14,790 --> 00:12:22,817
That force you're trying to overcome to get to the goal. The way that I've drawn it here, though, of course, if I say, well, let's play this new game, I'm going to modify that last one because it was too boring.

246
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:30,363
I'm going to say, when I say go stand on your chair, jump up and touch the ceiling, and the first one to touch it wins, that would not go over very well either.

247
00:12:31,124 --> 00:12:35,128
So what you do is you kind of break it down with decisions to work around these.

248
00:12:36,149 --> 00:12:39,001
How do I move around this? Can I move through it? Or go under it? Around it?

249
00:12:39,222 --> 00:12:40,386
How many different decisions are there?

250
00:12:41,784 --> 00:12:46,329
the rule system that binds the whole thing together, and this is how it defines what's

251
00:12:46,349 --> 00:12:51,914
going on inside that box. And then the last part, what I would call interaction, the input,

252
00:12:52,034 --> 00:12:56,378
but more importantly the output coming from that system, also that sets the dynamics and

253
00:12:56,398 --> 00:13:01,202
motion of the system, makes it come to life. So this is it. This is like my simple model.

254
00:13:01,462 --> 00:13:05,406
And like now I can make a game, a class about these different topics, and we'll just like

255
00:13:05,466 --> 00:13:06,227
run through the curriculum.

256
00:13:06,928 --> 00:13:07,909
And this worked out pretty well.

257
00:13:08,290 --> 00:13:09,932
So I'm going to go through the different sections.

258
00:13:10,233 --> 00:13:13,698
Oh, actually, before I get into it, this drawing right here

259
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,922
It is great to define a game, but there's the question, like, so what?

260
00:13:19,763 --> 00:13:24,405
If this is really true, if this defines every game, then it also defines every bad game

261
00:13:24,485 --> 00:13:24,925
ever made.

262
00:13:25,766 --> 00:13:28,387
And so it's like, now I know what a bad game looks like.

263
00:13:28,427 --> 00:13:30,508
Hey, it looks exactly the same as the best game ever made.

264
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,169
So this is not too helpful.

265
00:13:33,049 --> 00:13:36,791
What we really want as a teacher, I want my students to make the best games possible,

266
00:13:36,891 --> 00:13:39,812
not just make a game, because you can phone that in, no problem.

267
00:13:40,804 --> 00:13:43,524
So I teach them to think about it as a series of slider bars.

268
00:13:43,844 --> 00:13:44,824
It's not a binary thing.

269
00:13:44,844 --> 00:13:46,465
This is a game or this isn't a game.

270
00:13:47,285 --> 00:13:48,305
That's not really important.

271
00:13:48,965 --> 00:13:50,686
We don't have a need for people to run around the world

272
00:13:50,726 --> 00:13:52,426
saying, oh, that's a game and that one's not a game.

273
00:13:53,746 --> 00:13:55,027
What makes it great?

274
00:13:55,087 --> 00:13:57,187
And so if you think of these as slider bars, the goal then

275
00:13:57,347 --> 00:14:00,368
of the game designer is to make all of these systems as

276
00:14:00,428 --> 00:14:02,188
cool as possible, to make them as great as

277
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:03,308
they possibly can be.

278
00:14:06,988 --> 00:14:09,710
All right, so let's start out with the simple one, goals.

279
00:14:10,130 --> 00:14:11,191
Seems so simple.

280
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:14,454
And yet, as I started digging into it, I found it's actually

281
00:14:14,494 --> 00:14:14,954
quite rich.

282
00:14:15,535 --> 00:14:18,657
What I'm trying to get across here, the thing that would

283
00:14:18,677 --> 00:14:22,760
pull that slider from 0 up to 10 is, is the player's

284
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,462
relationship to the goal really clear?

285
00:14:24,962 --> 00:14:27,804
Because if the goal isn't really clear, then the player

286
00:14:27,984 --> 00:14:29,586
doesn't really know what to do next or where they

287
00:14:29,666 --> 00:14:30,266
are through that.

288
00:14:31,245 --> 00:14:35,167
And more important, if you think of that blue line as a narrative that the player is going

289
00:14:35,187 --> 00:14:39,629
to engage in, is the drama increasing as the player gets towards the goal?

290
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:42,130
Is there like a sense of dramatic tension building up?

291
00:14:42,550 --> 00:14:43,691
Is the game getting more exciting?

292
00:14:43,731 --> 00:14:47,632
And we've all played games like Risk and Monopoly where they reach some kind of high point and

293
00:14:47,652 --> 00:14:49,993
then you play for an hour or more while everybody's really bored.

294
00:14:50,734 --> 00:14:55,475
So, you can tune in that narrative by changing your start and your goal.

295
00:14:55,635 --> 00:14:59,596
We mostly think about the goal, but I think the start is just as important when you look

296
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:00,376
at it from the other way.

297
00:15:01,236 --> 00:15:03,276
This is a game I didn't design, Backgammon.

298
00:15:03,476 --> 00:15:05,417
How many people have played Backgammon?

299
00:15:06,157 --> 00:15:08,318
How many people have played Backgammon with a doubling cube?

300
00:15:08,438 --> 00:15:09,078
Keep your hands up.

301
00:15:09,138 --> 00:15:10,738
The doubling cube is this little thing in the middle.

302
00:15:11,258 --> 00:15:13,759
And if you've played with a doubling cube, have you played for money?

303
00:15:14,039 --> 00:15:14,679
Keep your hands up.

304
00:15:15,219 --> 00:15:18,600
So, only the few six people with their hands up, you've played Backgammon.

305
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:19,320
No one else hasn't.

306
00:15:21,990 --> 00:15:25,373
you once you do that you can't go back. The other thing is just so shallow. So anyway,

307
00:15:25,393 --> 00:15:29,376
I could give a whole talk about backgammon. In fact, in my class I do. It's 5,000 years

308
00:15:29,477 --> 00:15:34,101
old, so there's a lot of good in it, obviously, if it survived that long. What I want to point

309
00:15:34,141 --> 00:15:39,085
out for this, though, in the relation of start and end goals is this is the board. If you

310
00:15:39,125 --> 00:15:43,009
haven't played backgammon, it looks incredibly cryptic. Most people, when I talk to them,

311
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,413
they remember it as that board on the back of their checkers game that made no sense

312
00:15:47,453 --> 00:15:48,354
to them when they were a kid.

313
00:15:49,034 --> 00:15:50,916
And I see a lot of you nodding your head, so yes, you know that.

314
00:15:52,357 --> 00:15:57,703
So what happens is the brown player, he'd be sitting over on the left and he has to

315
00:15:57,743 --> 00:16:00,746
get all of his pieces off the board going around that big U shape.

316
00:16:01,366 --> 00:16:03,569
The white player sits on the right, he goes the other way.

317
00:16:04,069 --> 00:16:05,510
It still seems kind of weird.

318
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:06,251
Why do they do that?

319
00:16:06,391 --> 00:16:08,013
Let me make it more obvious what's going on.

320
00:16:08,413 --> 00:16:09,354
If we split the board...

321
00:16:10,390 --> 00:16:13,291
you can kind of see much easier what's happening now.

322
00:16:13,932 --> 00:16:16,653
So, it's actually, the board was split.

323
00:16:16,753 --> 00:16:18,113
If you look at the history of games,

324
00:16:18,773 --> 00:16:20,734
at some point it folded together for compactness

325
00:16:20,794 --> 00:16:21,374
or who knows what.

326
00:16:22,175 --> 00:16:24,015
But it kind of used to look like these tracks

327
00:16:24,055 --> 00:16:24,976
that were just going this way.

328
00:16:25,816 --> 00:16:27,317
There's still this question of why is it

329
00:16:27,577 --> 00:16:29,017
like so seemingly random?

330
00:16:29,037 --> 00:16:30,258
Why are the pieces the way they are?

331
00:16:30,298 --> 00:16:32,098
Like, if I was the game designer of this game,

332
00:16:32,138 --> 00:16:33,099
I'd clean up that mess.

333
00:16:33,179 --> 00:16:34,299
I would do something like that.

334
00:16:34,379 --> 00:16:36,260
I would move all the pieces to the start spots

335
00:16:36,280 --> 00:16:38,361
because that would be like much cleaner and easier to do.

336
00:16:39,081 --> 00:16:42,424
Well, it turns out that game that I'm showing you right now actually existed.

337
00:16:43,105 --> 00:16:45,688
There's artifacts that show games much like this.

338
00:16:46,368 --> 00:16:50,673
And it's really boring because you spend the first few moves doing nothing.

339
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:51,854
You're not interacting at all.

340
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:55,477
So at some point along the way, some brilliant primitive game designer,

341
00:16:56,158 --> 00:16:58,380
forefather of ours, he's like, you know what?

342
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:00,683
This game would rule if we fought on the first turn.

343
00:17:01,143 --> 00:17:02,825
So let's move all of our pieces together.

344
00:17:03,425 --> 00:17:07,026
and then uh... his son or whoever took up the the lead was like if we move more

345
00:17:07,066 --> 00:17:07,406
pieces

346
00:17:07,727 --> 00:17:08,447
it'll be even better

347
00:17:08,467 --> 00:17:11,428
and so what they're doing is they're not tuning the goal the goal still exactly

348
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:13,008
the same they're tuning that star condition

349
00:17:13,708 --> 00:17:16,809
uh... and then you get when you really look what's going on white only needs to

350
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,490
move two pieces across the board

351
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:19,570
it's like this uh...

352
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:22,471
ancient buddy movie you know where these two guys have to like work their way

353
00:17:22,511 --> 00:17:24,431
through all odds and become friends at the end

354
00:17:25,112 --> 00:17:27,072
uh... you know finally overcoming their obstacles

355
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:30,180
So that's kind of a good example of the start,

356
00:17:30,561 --> 00:17:32,982
and I like it so much that I didn't bother making a game about the start stuff,

357
00:17:33,002 --> 00:17:34,644
because I, like I said, I love backgammon.

358
00:17:35,785 --> 00:17:38,507
But for the goal part, the other side of that line,

359
00:17:38,967 --> 00:17:40,068
we can tune that as well.

360
00:17:40,969 --> 00:17:43,451
So the exercise, the goal cards game has a goal.

361
00:17:43,691 --> 00:17:45,112
This talk gets kind of meta sometimes,

362
00:17:45,132 --> 00:17:47,013
because I'm talking about game design to game designers,

363
00:17:47,053 --> 00:17:48,555
about games that teach game design.

364
00:17:49,677 --> 00:17:51,297
But this one has a goal to teach goals.

365
00:17:51,998 --> 00:17:56,960
But one of the exercise goals is what are different goals?

366
00:17:57,740 --> 00:17:58,580
How can we break them down?

367
00:17:58,600 --> 00:18:01,482
There's not just one type, get here, or collect 100 points.

368
00:18:01,662 --> 00:18:02,642
Like there's a whole bunch of those.

369
00:18:02,682 --> 00:18:03,442
Let's talk about them.

370
00:18:04,563 --> 00:18:06,344
Try to only change the goal, not the rules.

371
00:18:06,404 --> 00:18:11,806
So I'll make a game with very simple rules and then, you know, just only change the goal

372
00:18:12,206 --> 00:18:12,666
if we can.

373
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:15,387
Try not to mess with the rest of the systems and then talk about that.

374
00:18:15,487 --> 00:18:15,988
What does that mean?

375
00:18:17,085 --> 00:18:19,929
So the game is really as simple as I can make it.

376
00:18:19,949 --> 00:18:20,790
You reach into a bag.

377
00:18:20,810 --> 00:18:22,152
You pull out a colored poker chip.

378
00:18:22,212 --> 00:18:24,355
They have different values, a different distribution

379
00:18:24,375 --> 00:18:24,816
in the bag.

380
00:18:25,356 --> 00:18:26,658
You flick it onto the table and you

381
00:18:26,678 --> 00:18:27,780
try to hit another poker chip.

382
00:18:27,820 --> 00:18:29,562
And if you hit another poker chip, you score it.

383
00:18:29,622 --> 00:18:32,086
You put it on your side or into your cup there.

384
00:18:34,699 --> 00:18:36,901
So we start out with the really simple, like, collect 100 points.

385
00:18:37,081 --> 00:18:37,862
What does this feel like?

386
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:39,043
And then we tried a couple ways.

387
00:18:39,183 --> 00:18:43,327
One is you keep your points secret, and one is you display your points publicly.

388
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:45,229
And we talk about the differences between those two things.

389
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:48,331
Then we start messing around with, well, some timed goals.

390
00:18:49,332 --> 00:18:50,974
Collect the most points in five minutes.

391
00:18:51,354 --> 00:18:53,516
How does that feel different when you're just trying to collect 100 points?

392
00:18:54,257 --> 00:18:55,638
Collect the most chips in three minutes.

393
00:18:55,878 --> 00:18:58,140
Suddenly, we talk about how that invalidated or just made...

394
00:19:00,102 --> 00:19:02,984
the rule about colored chips now is meaningless because of the goal.

395
00:19:03,405 --> 00:19:05,907
And I see this a lot of time in game design where people will change the goal

396
00:19:05,947 --> 00:19:09,830
and not realize that they've actually made some of their rules meaningless to the game system.

397
00:19:10,811 --> 00:19:14,714
And then this, the other one over there, collect the most points in five rounds of play.

398
00:19:14,974 --> 00:19:18,537
That's kind of like saying, let's get rid of, that's almost like moving the start condition up.

399
00:19:19,017 --> 00:19:21,960
It's saying, let's just play the last five turns because those are probably the most exciting anyway.

400
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:23,681
And let's see how that feels.

401
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:26,663
And, you know, some of these are more exciting than others, some are more strategic.

402
00:19:26,944 --> 00:19:27,684
We talk about that.

403
00:19:28,605 --> 00:19:36,410
Then this idea of a negative goal, you're not trying to accomplish something, you're trying to avoid, or you're trying to be the last one standing while everyone else gets knocked out.

404
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:42,368
and multiple goals, a bunch of cards, we deal them out randomly and now you're playing,

405
00:19:42,388 --> 00:19:45,911
there's multiple things going on. We randomly change them, there's a deck of them and you

406
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:49,855
start flipping them down. And every time they win one of these games, they get a goal card

407
00:19:49,875 --> 00:19:53,659
and they put it in their pocket. And through the series of exercises, they're collecting

408
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,463
goal cards the whole time. And the idea is the winner is the one with the most goal cards

409
00:19:57,503 --> 00:19:57,863
at the end.

410
00:19:58,664 --> 00:20:01,906
The last little bit we do, they're secret goals that only you know what they are,

411
00:20:02,386 --> 00:20:05,588
and everybody else just has to kind of try to figure out what you're doing,

412
00:20:05,768 --> 00:20:08,230
and some of them are really crazy and almost impossible.

413
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:12,970
So, we finish that part, and then they have to make their own goal.

414
00:20:13,070 --> 00:20:16,491
Now they understand all about goals, all these different ways we can mix them and match them

415
00:20:16,531 --> 00:20:17,071
and play with them.

416
00:20:17,111 --> 00:20:18,592
So, make your own, I give them a blank card.

417
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,392
They play those for a while.

418
00:20:20,532 --> 00:20:23,754
Some are really off target, some are really cool.

419
00:20:24,174 --> 00:20:25,954
We talk about which ones worked, which ones didn't.

420
00:20:26,815 --> 00:20:29,115
Also, we shuffle them all up so no one knows, like you draw them out.

421
00:20:29,155 --> 00:20:32,597
You don't get your own back again necessarily, although you could, so you have to be careful

422
00:20:32,617 --> 00:20:33,857
not to make something too impossible.

423
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:36,912
uh... then at the very end of it

424
00:20:37,292 --> 00:20:40,013
i count up who has the most cards and this is that winner thing that i was

425
00:20:40,054 --> 00:20:42,275
talking about it's like whoever has the most gold cards wins

426
00:20:42,615 --> 00:20:44,176
i promote your card to the next year

427
00:20:44,596 --> 00:20:48,619
so i'm gonna do nice art for your card put your name on it like a magic card

428
00:20:48,679 --> 00:20:48,979
artist

429
00:20:49,619 --> 00:20:53,442
and uh... and promote you to next year's class and that's like a huge goal for

430
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:55,663
the students like oh yeah i want to be that one guy who

431
00:20:56,123 --> 00:20:57,064
who gets to go forwards

432
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:59,966
uh... print that out for them just kind of a fun little thing at the end

433
00:21:01,565 --> 00:21:05,308
So, as we go through the different phases, at the very end, I was like,

434
00:21:05,608 --> 00:21:08,790
well, we've been talking about goals, but you realize there's all these, like, sub-goals.

435
00:21:08,810 --> 00:21:09,911
We can break this thing down.

436
00:21:10,331 --> 00:21:13,113
So you're trying to win a chip as a goal of that particular turn.

437
00:21:13,133 --> 00:21:15,574
You're trying to win the cards, get the most cards, get your card promoted.

438
00:21:16,555 --> 00:21:18,516
And we can take that idea, everything I just talked about,

439
00:21:18,536 --> 00:21:20,877
the start and end, and the goal, and the journey between,

440
00:21:20,898 --> 00:21:22,559
and we can start subdividing and subdividing,

441
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:25,220
and think of our game as a series of chunks like that.

442
00:21:29,325 --> 00:21:31,146
Alright, the next section, opposition.

443
00:21:31,166 --> 00:21:37,171
This is going to try to focus just on that red bar there in the middle and what game

444
00:21:37,271 --> 00:21:39,213
would really like bring that out to the class.

445
00:21:40,054 --> 00:21:44,758
So flow comes up a lot, this idea that you don't want the opposition to be too hard because

446
00:21:44,778 --> 00:21:47,180
then the game gets frustrating, you don't want to be too easy because then the game

447
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:47,840
gets too boring.

448
00:21:48,280 --> 00:21:51,223
Try to get the player into that nice groove of flow.

449
00:21:51,843 --> 00:21:56,446
And this sense of accomplishment, like, that the player feels really happy,

450
00:21:56,606 --> 00:22:02,771
that superior almost to the opposition as they work their way through and past the obstacle.

451
00:22:02,811 --> 00:22:05,172
Of course if they can't get past it, then they're not going to feel that.

452
00:22:05,192 --> 00:22:07,754
But when they do get past it, you want them to feel this moment of triumph,

453
00:22:08,354 --> 00:22:09,615
a very emotional kind of feeling.

454
00:22:09,976 --> 00:22:11,577
And that means your opposition is well-tuned.

455
00:22:12,738 --> 00:22:15,982
So the game that I came up with being college students, I figured they would understand this one.

456
00:22:16,623 --> 00:22:18,946
Here's a red cup and a ping pong ball. Guess what you do with this?

457
00:22:18,966 --> 00:22:24,734
You know, it's really like, what's the most basic thing I can think of that will demonstrate this concept?

458
00:22:24,794 --> 00:22:29,180
And this came to mind. Even though I teach on Saturday, I still don't bring in beers. I haven't been that bold yet.

459
00:22:31,242 --> 00:22:35,763
So, we talked about incremental difficulty tuning, how you can slowly kind of ratchet

460
00:22:35,784 --> 00:22:40,665
it up or turn it down. This difference between hard and soft obstacles, the hard obstacle

461
00:22:40,685 --> 00:22:43,066
would be like a wall. It's like you're not going through it, you have to go around it

462
00:22:43,426 --> 00:22:47,887
one way or another. And soft optical, think of it like mud that I can slog through it

463
00:22:47,907 --> 00:22:48,207
slowly.

464
00:22:49,766 --> 00:22:53,068
giving the player an edge, you can make obstacles,

465
00:22:53,948 --> 00:22:56,289
all these different obstacles, but the player has to always have the edge,

466
00:22:56,329 --> 00:22:58,611
the rule system always has to let the player get through them all.

467
00:22:59,531 --> 00:23:02,112
And then the difference between opposition and opponents,

468
00:23:03,073 --> 00:23:04,394
sometimes people get those confused,

469
00:23:04,974 --> 00:23:06,975
but opposition doesn't need to be your opponent,

470
00:23:07,175 --> 00:23:10,056
it could be just the board itself, the configuration,

471
00:23:10,096 --> 00:23:12,638
you could have a cooperative game where you're playing against a deck or whatever,

472
00:23:13,758 --> 00:23:15,599
but a game like basketball or football or something,

473
00:23:15,619 --> 00:23:18,881
where your opponent is really the obstacle, the opposition in your way.

474
00:23:21,017 --> 00:23:25,439
So Obstacle Pong, their first task, they go off into different rooms and they build a

475
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:27,060
miniature golf course essentially.

476
00:23:27,701 --> 00:23:29,962
And their first task is build a par one course.

477
00:23:30,422 --> 00:23:32,443
Can you build a course that is par one?

478
00:23:32,643 --> 00:23:34,644
Everybody can get the ball in the cup no matter what.

479
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:36,042
Does everybody do that?

480
00:23:36,142 --> 00:23:36,402
Great.

481
00:23:36,642 --> 00:23:37,683
Let's move on to part two.

482
00:23:37,703 --> 00:23:40,485
It's actually a little harder than you might think to do

483
00:23:40,525 --> 00:23:40,685
that.

484
00:23:42,167 --> 00:23:44,669
Then, now step back and say, what's a part two course?

485
00:23:44,709 --> 00:23:46,710
And here it's like, put a bottle of water on your head

486
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:51,274
and throw it into the, if you got it into this area, you

487
00:23:51,294 --> 00:23:53,156
could move anywhere in that area and then just drop it.

488
00:23:54,553 --> 00:23:56,877
and the water is kind of that soft goal idea,

489
00:23:56,977 --> 00:23:58,459
or I mean a soft obstacle idea.

490
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,462
And then step back to par three

491
00:24:00,923 --> 00:24:02,445
and kind of keep working backwards.

492
00:24:02,465 --> 00:24:04,328
So they build out the series of obstacles

493
00:24:04,368 --> 00:24:06,371
until they get what should be a par five course.

494
00:24:07,748 --> 00:24:09,210
Here's some of the different things.

495
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:10,191
Again, they tear up the rooms.

496
00:24:10,211 --> 00:24:10,852
They all have their own room.

497
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:13,575
It's kind of fun at the end because you, it's like playing miniature golf.

498
00:24:13,595 --> 00:24:16,338
Like you run from hole to hole and you don't know what to expect in the other rooms.

499
00:24:16,718 --> 00:24:18,079
And you have to play your own course too.

500
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:19,181
So here's one.

501
00:24:19,201 --> 00:24:22,985
They're bouncing it off the art desks, trying to hit it into this cup over here.

502
00:24:24,647 --> 00:24:25,428
This one was fun.

503
00:24:25,588 --> 00:24:28,511
They went to the room with the curtains that went together and they turned off the lights

504
00:24:28,591 --> 00:24:29,112
on one side.

505
00:24:30,144 --> 00:24:34,069
So you have to kick it down this path, but you don't know what is on the other side.

506
00:24:34,309 --> 00:24:38,294
So there's kind of this little mystery element, which I thought was really a nice touch.

507
00:24:39,882 --> 00:24:43,205
This one here kind of shows what really happens though, which I tell them it's a

508
00:24:44,485 --> 00:24:47,488
game design about obstacles. It's not really, it turns out,

509
00:24:48,008 --> 00:24:49,689
because ping pong balls are so finicky

510
00:24:50,490 --> 00:24:54,292
and if they miss, who knows where they're going to go, they're going to roll all over the place.

511
00:24:54,772 --> 00:24:57,234
And so they end up spending more time funneling

512
00:24:57,774 --> 00:25:00,817
and helping the player try to get that ball in the cup. And here you can see

513
00:25:01,017 --> 00:25:02,938
they just like tore up posters off the walls.

514
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:06,841
make it easier, make it easier, we've got to get that par one, we've got to get that thing down,

515
00:25:06,901 --> 00:25:12,066
and that's really one of the important lessons that this teaches. It's like it's not about

516
00:25:12,326 --> 00:25:16,550
helping, it's not about hurting, it's about helping. Then the winning part is we actually

517
00:25:16,570 --> 00:25:20,634
keep score, I have these little score sheets, I play too, I think it's really important for the

518
00:25:20,914 --> 00:25:25,017
teacher, for me to go and play these games as well, so I get involved in systems, and I try to win,

519
00:25:25,158 --> 00:25:29,241
like I don't hold back, in fact, I make a big point of trying to be the winner so I can rub it in.

520
00:25:33,617 --> 00:25:37,538
The other obstacle goal here, this is Us vs. It. Some of you may have played this at the

521
00:25:37,998 --> 00:25:44,801
GDC tutorials on Monday and Tuesday. The idea is let's work with that balance, not too hard,

522
00:25:46,561 --> 00:25:50,503
not too easy. So we give them a robot and there's these tanks that are going to fight

523
00:25:50,523 --> 00:25:55,245
the robot. The idea is to tune for drama. I've talked about this dramatic arc, this

524
00:25:55,325 --> 00:25:58,666
dramatic tension that you want. And so I want them to, like, make this feel like a movie.

525
00:26:00,300 --> 00:26:01,882
They get this robot programming sheet.

526
00:26:02,343 --> 00:26:03,124
They get in little teams.

527
00:26:03,184 --> 00:26:04,946
And first, they're what I call the scientists.

528
00:26:04,986 --> 00:26:05,967
And the scientists get in teams.

529
00:26:05,987 --> 00:26:08,490
And their job is to program this super military robot in

530
00:26:08,530 --> 00:26:10,051
their lab, their secret lab somewhere.

531
00:26:10,752 --> 00:26:11,473
And they kind of fill it out.

532
00:26:11,493 --> 00:26:14,236
They give it a name like Doom Cuddles version 2.0.

533
00:26:15,337 --> 00:26:17,260
They fill out some instructions.

534
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:19,002
They get like 10 slots to fill out.

535
00:26:19,762 --> 00:26:23,384
They get to put in the damage numbers and how it moves and rotates and things like that.

536
00:26:23,524 --> 00:26:27,645
And then they get to give it a little secret special goal, a special ability.

537
00:26:28,566 --> 00:26:32,107
This one is like a self-repair thing that every turn it gained a hit point automatically.

538
00:26:32,447 --> 00:26:37,689
But they've done jump jets and burrowing and call downs from satellites and all sorts of teleporting, things like that.

539
00:26:38,070 --> 00:26:40,631
So there's a huge space there for them to be creative in.

540
00:26:41,451 --> 00:26:44,232
Then they take their robot and fight against tanks.

541
00:26:44,272 --> 00:26:47,573
And the idea, the story here, is that the robot, of course,

542
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,494
escapes from the lab.

543
00:26:49,294 --> 00:26:51,635
And now they become tank commanders.

544
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,856
Because the robot's been programmed, they can't change

545
00:26:53,916 --> 00:26:54,736
the robot anymore.

546
00:26:55,436 --> 00:26:56,937
And they've got to now fight these tanks.

547
00:26:57,257 --> 00:26:59,918
And the tanks now have to fight the robot to keep it

548
00:26:59,938 --> 00:27:01,138
from crossing the goal line.

549
00:27:01,599 --> 00:27:03,159
So the robot's trying to cross the board.

550
00:27:03,199 --> 00:27:04,680
And this is the orphanage right over here.

551
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:08,481
And so if the robot crosses that line, he steps on the

552
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:09,882
orphanage and kills all the kids.

553
00:27:10,982 --> 00:27:11,423
uh... so

554
00:27:12,163 --> 00:27:16,105
it's trivially easy well so that the tanks uh... they're set the

555
00:27:16,806 --> 00:27:20,128
the students can't mess with the tanks uh... they'd have a very simple move

556
00:27:20,168 --> 00:27:21,369
shoot rotate kind of scheme

557
00:27:22,109 --> 00:27:23,270
and that can't be changed

558
00:27:23,962 --> 00:27:26,263
And at this point, the robot can't really be changed either.

559
00:27:26,283 --> 00:27:29,665
But what happens is it's trivially easy to make a robot

560
00:27:29,685 --> 00:27:31,086
that wins on the first turn, because you give it 10

561
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:33,227
movement actions, and it just wins on turn one.

562
00:27:34,167 --> 00:27:36,168
It's really easy to make a robot that dies on the first

563
00:27:36,188 --> 00:27:37,909
turn, you give it like one hit point, and you have it turn

564
00:27:37,929 --> 00:27:39,690
around backwards, and then the tanks come in and shoot it

565
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:40,210
from behind.

566
00:27:40,971 --> 00:27:43,732
So the goal here for the students is to, I want that

567
00:27:43,772 --> 00:27:44,512
Hollywood ending.

568
00:27:45,733 --> 00:27:49,095
the robot down to one hit point, about ready to step over the line,

569
00:27:49,675 --> 00:27:52,597
right when the last tank, because the other three have been blown up, and the

570
00:27:52,617 --> 00:27:53,437
captain's all bloody,

571
00:27:54,118 --> 00:27:56,879
he's like hitting the button and then he blows up the robot.

572
00:27:56,919 --> 00:28:00,041
It's like, that's what I want, that's the tuning that I want. So

573
00:28:00,521 --> 00:28:03,223
since they can't do the tanks, they just keep going back to the robot, iterating on it

574
00:28:03,883 --> 00:28:06,525
and seeing how it does. And eventually they get this robot that,

575
00:28:06,785 --> 00:28:09,687
hopefully, after an hour or so, is like this perfectly tuned robot.

576
00:28:10,814 --> 00:28:14,737
The real trick here at the end, there's always a trick on these,

577
00:28:15,518 --> 00:28:19,401
is that I didn't really want them to fight the tanks, I wanted them to fight each other.

578
00:28:20,422 --> 00:28:24,665
And since they've all tuned to the same tanks, and you can't change the tanks,

579
00:28:25,285 --> 00:28:28,808
the idea, which usually turns out to be pretty close to truth,

580
00:28:29,308 --> 00:28:32,591
is that the robots are all balanced with each other, even though they're completely different,

581
00:28:33,051 --> 00:28:34,352
because they've all been tuned to the same thing.

582
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:38,997
And even though they have teleporters and laser call downs and burrowing and all this other stuff,

583
00:28:39,278 --> 00:28:41,000
it's amazing how close these battles are.

584
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:45,005
The other thing I find is pretty amazing is that there's no decisions in this game,

585
00:28:45,045 --> 00:28:46,927
like you've already, well, you've made your decisions up front.

586
00:28:47,408 --> 00:28:48,950
So when the gameplay actually plays out...

587
00:28:50,291 --> 00:28:54,455
you just follow the program and that's all you can do, and how exciting it is.

588
00:28:54,875 --> 00:28:57,677
You would think that would be like, that's kind of boring, you're just going to sit there and watch these things go,

589
00:28:57,757 --> 00:29:02,161
but it's not that way at all. It's like everybody's cheering, because you can't see ahead in the future,

590
00:29:02,181 --> 00:29:03,962
that you don't really know what's going to happen.

591
00:29:04,943 --> 00:29:10,627
And then when it plays out, there's just a lot of like cheering and oohs and aahs and laughing, which is great.

592
00:29:11,368 --> 00:29:15,571
So we really get that drama. So each sheet, kind of each robot running its own little sheet there.

593
00:29:18,093 --> 00:29:18,814
All right, so moving on.

594
00:29:21,645 --> 00:29:25,946
the idea of decisions and how we get around those obstacles.

595
00:29:27,507 --> 00:29:31,088
Sid Meier gave a talk yesterday about interesting decisions, so I'm not going to go into that

596
00:29:31,128 --> 00:29:34,329
at all. I'll let him refer to his talk. I'm sure he has a lot more to say about it than

597
00:29:34,349 --> 00:29:41,250
I do anyway. But it's really true. It's like, what am I doing as a player? You give me a

598
00:29:41,290 --> 00:29:43,231
million decisions, but if only one of them is good, then...

599
00:29:44,262 --> 00:29:45,543
That's not a very interesting choice.

600
00:29:46,464 --> 00:29:48,866
This feeling of creativity and discovery, though, is the

601
00:29:48,886 --> 00:29:50,727
emotion that I really want to bring out in the players that

602
00:29:50,747 --> 00:29:52,669
I want the students to experiment with.

603
00:29:53,509 --> 00:29:56,011
How does the player feel like they did

604
00:29:56,071 --> 00:29:57,192
something really creative?

605
00:29:57,232 --> 00:29:58,893
Maybe the game designer didn't even think of this.

606
00:29:59,574 --> 00:30:02,076
And that's a really good win for the player to feel like

607
00:30:02,096 --> 00:30:04,217
they're better than the designer of the game, and that

608
00:30:04,257 --> 00:30:05,358
discovery that comes from that.

609
00:30:06,763 --> 00:30:11,405
So, a hundred zombies. One of my games last year that I showed, the Weapons of Zombie

610
00:30:11,425 --> 00:30:17,167
Destruction, I had overpurchased zombies. So, I had a huge drawer full of little plastic

611
00:30:17,187 --> 00:30:21,609
zombies and I'm like, I've got to do something with these. So, we're going to use those in

612
00:30:21,629 --> 00:30:25,951
this game. It's really about balancing those decisions with each other so that all the

613
00:30:25,991 --> 00:30:30,873
decisions are worthwhile, that you don't always pick this one and never another one.

614
00:30:31,834 --> 00:30:35,557
I also really want to encourage expression and role playing with this exercise.

615
00:30:35,638 --> 00:30:40,923
So I pulled some pieces out of a game called The Last Night on Earth, a zombie horror type game.

616
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:46,749
These are all just like the archetypical, you know, the stereotypes that you would see in a B-grade zombie movie.

617
00:30:47,369 --> 00:30:49,712
These different characters, like the boy genius and the jock.

618
00:30:50,772 --> 00:30:56,234
And so I really want them to get, as if they're playing one of those characters, I want them to feel like they are that character.

619
00:30:56,374 --> 00:30:58,835
It's not just they're pushing a piece of cardboard around.

620
00:30:59,295 --> 00:31:00,455
They are a boy genius.

621
00:31:01,036 --> 00:31:03,696
And how are the decisions going to make you feel that way?

622
00:31:04,697 --> 00:31:08,738
And then you combine these characters at the end to see this new story start to form.

623
00:31:08,778 --> 00:31:12,059
As these different characters come together, how does the story, how does the narrative change?

624
00:31:13,639 --> 00:31:18,722
So the game itself is, as all these are, try to be very simple with them. You set up a

625
00:31:18,762 --> 00:31:21,945
bunch of zombies around the perimeter. If you want to try to run this game on your own,

626
00:31:22,125 --> 00:31:26,648
you can either, you can just search bag O zombies and you can get like a huge bag of

627
00:31:26,708 --> 00:31:31,312
zombies for like ten bucks, which is what I did about twenty times. So I've got thousands

628
00:31:31,332 --> 00:31:36,536
of these. Then you can also just use pennies. I've seen people run it with pennies before

629
00:31:36,556 --> 00:31:40,639
and then it's kind of like these Abraham Lincoln zombies are attacking, which is, it'll cost

630
00:31:40,659 --> 00:31:41,520
you a dollar to do that.

631
00:31:43,685 --> 00:31:48,188
then you roll a die, and the direction that you roll is the direction that all the zombies

632
00:31:48,208 --> 00:31:52,871
will move. So if you roll a three, then they all move towards the three side, and if you

633
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:56,653
roll, in this case, a two, they're all moving up. So eventually they're going to close in

634
00:31:56,713 --> 00:31:58,174
on the player and kill him.

635
00:31:59,198 --> 00:32:01,760
but of course the player doesn't just stand still, the player needs to

636
00:32:02,260 --> 00:32:04,883
have some decisions, some interesting decisions to work with, so

637
00:32:05,363 --> 00:32:07,805
there's the full rules of the game, they fit on one little card

638
00:32:08,406 --> 00:32:11,468
and rule two is the only one you need to pay attention to, which is insert your

639
00:32:11,508 --> 00:32:11,989
rules here

640
00:32:12,489 --> 00:32:14,311
and this is the one I give to the students, it's like

641
00:32:14,751 --> 00:32:16,733
give me the list of decisions based on your character

642
00:32:17,273 --> 00:32:19,675
so how does a priest move, how does a priest attack

643
00:32:20,096 --> 00:32:21,437
and I don't have them do the mechanics

644
00:32:21,837 --> 00:32:24,039
that's not important at this phase of the game

645
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:26,121
uh... just tell me what priests do

646
00:32:27,142 --> 00:32:30,064
and tell me the verb, tell me the words that

647
00:32:30,384 --> 00:32:33,946
describe what priests do, and they come up with things like this. And then, you know,

648
00:32:33,966 --> 00:32:34,907
the town drunk team,

649
00:32:35,067 --> 00:32:38,730
meanwhile, in another corner, they have their own set and hopefully

650
00:32:38,910 --> 00:32:42,032
they're completely different than the priest, although sometimes they align. I don't know how that works.

651
00:32:42,132 --> 00:32:43,073
I'm just kidding.

652
00:32:45,017 --> 00:32:47,877
So you build those up and then you kind of play out your game.

653
00:32:48,858 --> 00:32:52,478
Then you add mechanics behind all of those, like what does it mean to step versus stagger?

654
00:32:52,879 --> 00:32:57,580
Is it, you know, for step maybe you have one space, but the jock might be able to sprint instead of step.

655
00:32:58,360 --> 00:33:01,741
And then the drunk might roll a die and randomly move in a direction and that's a stagger.

656
00:33:02,141 --> 00:33:05,062
So then they have to translate that word into a mechanic in the game.

657
00:33:05,722 --> 00:33:09,043
Play it for a while, do a little bit of balancing with the decisions.

658
00:33:09,963 --> 00:33:11,884
And then we join the boards together.

659
00:33:11,904 --> 00:33:15,946
So now there's two characters with double the number of

660
00:33:15,966 --> 00:33:17,567
zombies, and then we'll double that.

661
00:33:18,508 --> 00:33:21,770
So then you've got close to 100 zombies and four characters.

662
00:33:22,050 --> 00:33:25,112
And at this point, I know it's a success if they're really

663
00:33:25,132 --> 00:33:26,152
role-playing their characters.

664
00:33:26,272 --> 00:33:29,034
And so what I'm listening for is people talking in accents,

665
00:33:29,274 --> 00:33:31,475
people slurring their words if they're the drunk, people

666
00:33:31,515 --> 00:33:34,497
actually holding their hands if they're the priest, trying

667
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:35,678
to really get that sense.

668
00:33:35,718 --> 00:33:36,978
Then you know they're really engaged and

669
00:33:36,998 --> 00:33:37,699
they're really into it.

670
00:33:38,839 --> 00:33:41,501
from the level that they're now down in that world.

671
00:33:45,502 --> 00:33:49,064
The rule systems, you know, what makes a rule system good?

672
00:33:49,144 --> 00:33:53,666
It's the old cliche, easy to learn, and you all know the second part, a lifetime to master.

673
00:33:54,626 --> 00:33:59,528
For beginning students, they don't always think of this as like you get both.

674
00:34:00,309 --> 00:34:03,892
There's a feeling of it's kind of a teeter-totter. It's like if you make it easy to learn, then it's

675
00:34:03,932 --> 00:34:08,516
not going to be a lifetime to master and vice versa. And so really trying to teach them is like,

676
00:34:08,556 --> 00:34:11,918
no, you want both of these things. They're independent vectors. You want them to get as

677
00:34:11,978 --> 00:34:17,443
high up as possible. And that's really important to try to get that idea across in the rule system.

678
00:34:18,444 --> 00:34:22,147
So there's a series of little exercises that I do. This is actually over three weeks as

679
00:34:22,227 --> 00:34:25,350
kind of a warm-up when they first come into class to wake them up in the morning on a Saturday.

680
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,618
So we'll talk about rule structure in organization,

681
00:34:28,638 --> 00:34:31,479
how to really lay them out so that people can understand

682
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:34,820
them, how to write rules with precision so that people,

683
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,341
they're not ambiguous, that other people besides you know

684
00:34:38,361 --> 00:34:41,122
what you're talking about, and how to simplify your rule

685
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:44,103
system down so that it's really easy to learn.

686
00:34:44,763 --> 00:34:46,543
No matter how many rules you have, you can still make them

687
00:34:46,583 --> 00:34:48,944
simple if you're phrasing them in the right ways.

688
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:58,106
So the kind of first week is the take a stick and make a rule game. I write that on the board, I put up a bag of sticks, and we go around the room, we walk up front, grab a stick, make a rule.

689
00:34:58,166 --> 00:35:04,667
Some of you may have played games like this. So they come up front and make the rule, hey, if you get a green stick, give it to someone else.

690
00:35:05,528 --> 00:35:08,168
If you have two green sticks, then you have to sing or hum Poker Face.

691
00:35:08,668 --> 00:35:13,710
And so then immediately the next person goes up and grabs a green stick and gives it to the first person to get that funny thing going on.

692
00:35:14,970 --> 00:35:17,833
You have to close your eyes when taking a stick so you can't just keep grabbing green

693
00:35:17,893 --> 00:35:18,294
sticks.

694
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:21,597
When moving around the room, you have to hop on one foot because you have to go back and

695
00:35:21,637 --> 00:35:21,997
forth.

696
00:35:22,117 --> 00:35:25,140
And Sing Mary Had a Little Lamb, when your eyes are closed, on and on, keep your hands

697
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:25,500
behind your back.

698
00:35:25,521 --> 00:35:27,182
So they start stacking up all these rules one by one, and at some point I'm like, I

699
00:35:27,202 --> 00:35:27,402
don't know.

700
00:35:27,422 --> 00:35:27,843
I'm like, I don't know.

701
00:35:27,863 --> 00:35:28,103
I don't know.

702
00:35:28,123 --> 00:35:28,363
I don't know.

703
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:28,644
I don't know.

704
00:35:28,664 --> 00:35:28,964
I don't know.

705
00:35:28,984 --> 00:35:29,244
I don't know.

706
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:29,604
I don't know.

707
00:35:29,664 --> 00:35:29,945
I don't know.

708
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:30,265
I don't know.

709
00:35:30,285 --> 00:35:30,585
I don't know.

710
00:35:30,605 --> 00:35:30,846
I don't know.

711
00:35:30,866 --> 00:35:31,146
I don't know.

712
00:35:31,326 --> 00:35:33,527
I, you know, what's, what are you guys trying to really do here?

713
00:35:33,727 --> 00:35:35,909
Because it's, it's hilarious what they're doing.

714
00:35:36,029 --> 00:35:38,190
Like, they're bouncing all around and singing these songs,

715
00:35:38,270 --> 00:35:39,270
and they're all laughing.

716
00:35:39,290 --> 00:35:40,431
They're having the greatest time ever.

717
00:35:40,951 --> 00:35:42,472
But you realize this game will never end.

718
00:35:42,492 --> 00:35:44,433
It's like, it's like, because they have no goal.

719
00:35:45,154 --> 00:35:46,634
So it's really getting that point back again.

720
00:35:46,674 --> 00:35:49,396
It's like, without a goal, this is completely meaningless exercise.

721
00:35:50,096 --> 00:35:52,237
Oh, I don't know, meaningless is actually a blast.

722
00:35:53,598 --> 00:35:54,439
But teaches that lesson.

723
00:35:54,959 --> 00:35:58,842
So then the next week, we're like, now that we learned that lesson, let's define a goal,

724
00:35:58,922 --> 00:36:01,925
let's define our setup, let's be more specific about this.

725
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,347
And this is a similar thing, get 50 points in front of you so you're trying to get dice

726
00:36:05,367 --> 00:36:08,310
in front of you and the top face is how many points you have.

727
00:36:08,930 --> 00:36:12,373
And this time they still pick a die and they make a rule, but I put them all sequentially

728
00:36:12,393 --> 00:36:14,735
in order and you have to follow it like a turn order.

729
00:36:14,975 --> 00:36:17,176
You have to, you can only do one, you can only do two.

730
00:36:18,097 --> 00:36:19,498
The first one, the one I just showed you.

731
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:25,060
the, it's like spaghetti, you, it's really hard to analyze what you should be doing at

732
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,741
any one point in time because all the rules are cross-referring to other ones. This one

733
00:36:28,761 --> 00:36:32,281
is like you only have to look at number six, that's it, ignore everything else, now look

734
00:36:32,301 --> 00:36:37,922
at number seven, and so on. This game is much more organized, it gets boring really quick,

735
00:36:37,962 --> 00:36:42,183
unlike the first one which is more and more exciting and weird. This one gets, drags on

736
00:36:42,383 --> 00:36:45,424
as you start to step through all these rules and it gets really kind of tedious to run

737
00:36:45,444 --> 00:36:49,225
through after a while. It starts out good but it usually starts to like die really quick.

738
00:36:51,169 --> 00:36:54,992
Then the last one is try to get the best poker hand with five cards.

739
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:58,614
Now what we're going to do is everybody's still making rules, but they can delete other

740
00:36:58,674 --> 00:36:58,875
rules.

741
00:36:58,915 --> 00:37:02,717
They can insert them in the turn order wherever they want, and they can really basically kind

742
00:37:02,737 --> 00:37:06,500
of define this little structure, try to get it as simple as possible to make the game

743
00:37:07,221 --> 00:37:08,301
as entertaining as possible.

744
00:37:08,722 --> 00:37:12,765
Also I have them play simultaneous on this one, so everybody's doing all the stuff at

745
00:37:12,785 --> 00:37:16,107
the same time as much as possible, and that keeps the flow really going.

746
00:37:16,127 --> 00:37:19,409
Everybody's engaged instead of waiting for the person before them to take 11 actions

747
00:37:19,469 --> 00:37:20,730
before they get their 11 actions.

748
00:37:22,566 --> 00:37:25,389
The more advanced version of this is the Card Wars game.

749
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,653
This one's really about creating modular rules.

750
00:37:30,313 --> 00:37:33,737
They'll get these little rule cards and they'll make a rule for each one of the suits in the deck.

751
00:37:34,798 --> 00:37:38,381
How to balance those. They'll be doing this independently and secretly,

752
00:37:38,501 --> 00:37:41,944
and then they all get pushed together and then they have to try to balance them across the room

753
00:37:42,045 --> 00:37:44,467
as they start to move around. I'll talk about that in a second.

754
00:37:46,637 --> 00:37:49,601
there's as the rules get passed around you're reading other people's rules

755
00:37:50,162 --> 00:37:52,825
so you have to make these interpretations that you don't know if

756
00:37:52,865 --> 00:37:55,669
that's really what their intention was. That's the main part of the exercise

757
00:37:55,769 --> 00:37:58,512
actually is getting people to try to understand other people's rules

758
00:37:58,833 --> 00:38:03,298
and talk about how the language is causing problems in interpretation.

759
00:38:05,155 --> 00:38:07,457
And then this last part, easy to learn, right?

760
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:11,561
We want the, we're going to be making, I don't know, 30, 40 rules are going to be swirling

761
00:38:11,601 --> 00:38:12,341
around the system.

762
00:38:12,762 --> 00:38:14,003
How do we make them easy to learn?

763
00:38:14,663 --> 00:38:15,764
We have a lot of rules.

764
00:38:16,065 --> 00:38:18,567
There's tricks we can do to make that happen.

765
00:38:19,487 --> 00:38:20,749
So the game itself is just war.

766
00:38:20,949 --> 00:38:21,649
We've all played war.

767
00:38:21,810 --> 00:38:22,750
You get a deck of cards.

768
00:38:22,810 --> 00:38:26,053
In this case, they're just 1 through 10, so they have 40 cards, 10 of each suit.

769
00:38:27,556 --> 00:38:30,781
flip over the top one, highest wins, gets a poker chip.

770
00:38:30,861 --> 00:38:32,343
When you get 10 poker chips, you win the game.

771
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,967
The fun part comes in with the rules, though.

772
00:38:35,507 --> 00:38:37,891
So they have these four cards, and when you flip over a

773
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:40,574
spade, you get to trigger your spade rule.

774
00:38:41,296 --> 00:38:42,878
And the other person will have a different spade rule.

775
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:49,243
based on what they came up with. So to try to get this easy memory tricks, I don't have

776
00:38:49,323 --> 00:38:53,486
them do the rule, the mechanics, just like with that 100 zombies thing. Just give me

777
00:38:53,506 --> 00:38:57,949
the word. So spades, we say they're military, they're attack, they're aggressive. So give

778
00:38:57,969 --> 00:39:02,913
me a phrase, a word, that implies something aggressive, something attacking, like arrows

779
00:39:02,953 --> 00:39:06,835
flight. Then once they get those words written down, then go back in and do the mechanics.

780
00:39:07,736 --> 00:39:11,479
And now you have the shortcut, this easy way of remembering, oh, I have an arrow.

781
00:39:11,999 --> 00:39:16,280
and then in this case you're dropping arrows onto the floor and trying to get them to land face up.

782
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:21,001
So I won't go through all of these, but they all follow the same thing. Diamonds are about trying

783
00:39:21,021 --> 00:39:25,922
to get extra points, so they're usually a way of getting extra poker chips that you maybe didn't

784
00:39:25,962 --> 00:39:31,524
deserve to get through the normal mechanics of the game. Staffs, we have this kind of nature feel

785
00:39:31,744 --> 00:39:36,045
for them. Here they're kind of, instead of just pulling from the top of their deck,

786
00:39:36,065 --> 00:39:38,545
they're building up a hand of cards and they can make a decision.

787
00:39:39,702 --> 00:39:44,924
and this last one, the consolation present, the hearts are about giving and healing, so

788
00:39:44,944 --> 00:39:48,646
maybe taking cards from the discard pile and putting them back in your deck or giving bad

789
00:39:48,686 --> 00:39:56,149
cards to your friends in this case. So they kind of make those cards up, we shuffle them

790
00:39:56,189 --> 00:39:59,711
all up, you get your four, you move around the room, and then we just kind of play it

791
00:39:59,811 --> 00:40:01,391
out. And the idea is that...

792
00:40:02,329 --> 00:40:06,330
you correct the card if something seems wrong, even though it's not your rule to begin with.

793
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:13,371
Try to make it easier to understand. If something's too strong, then make it weaker. If something's

794
00:40:13,391 --> 00:40:18,032
too weak, make it stronger. And the goal then is at the end of the session, an hour or so,

795
00:40:19,292 --> 00:40:22,853
we should have a really balanced set of rules, even though everybody was independently in

796
00:40:22,893 --> 00:40:27,154
their own little rule module at any one time. We try to see how that would all come together.

797
00:40:27,174 --> 00:40:29,514
And that usually comes out pretty well. There's a few that usually get just wadded up and

798
00:40:29,534 --> 00:40:31,975
thrown away. But overall, the game gets pretty interesting.

799
00:40:34,888 --> 00:40:40,975
Alright, the interaction, the last section here, there's actually a lot here with interaction

800
00:40:41,575 --> 00:40:42,736
and kind of like...

801
00:40:43,776 --> 00:40:47,138
get, there's more than one exercise that just what I'd be able to come up with to really

802
00:40:47,178 --> 00:40:52,082
get the richness of what I mean by interaction. So the easy part of course is that it's the

803
00:40:52,142 --> 00:40:57,486
ease of input, the user interface. How do I talk to the game as a player? And, you know,

804
00:40:57,506 --> 00:41:01,769
that's kind of an obvious concept and we all understand that. The more subtle one is how

805
00:41:01,809 --> 00:41:07,232
does the game talk back to me, talk back to the players? And this one is kind of like

806
00:41:07,272 --> 00:41:11,075
what tricks can you use as a designer to get your game to talk, to speak to the players

807
00:41:11,095 --> 00:41:11,696
that are playing it.

808
00:41:12,496 --> 00:41:13,958
Well, one way is I'm going to reward you.

809
00:41:13,978 --> 00:41:16,340
You're going to pay attention to me if I reward you.

810
00:41:16,380 --> 00:41:18,162
So if the game system is outputting rewards,

811
00:41:18,502 --> 00:41:21,125
then I'm going to want to put more stuff in so I get those rewards back out again.

812
00:41:21,966 --> 00:41:23,307
The other thing I really look for,

813
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:26,490
the thing that would slide the interaction slider, you know, from 0 to 10,

814
00:41:26,991 --> 00:41:28,592
would be this immersive atmosphere.

815
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,315
This idea that I'm really in this game right now.

816
00:41:31,575 --> 00:41:33,777
I'm not. I've crossed that dotted line there.

817
00:41:34,278 --> 00:41:37,381
I'm not sitting at the table, I'm down inside the system.

818
00:41:37,781 --> 00:41:39,683
And if you can pull that off, then you know your game is

819
00:41:39,743 --> 00:41:41,345
really communicating well with the players.

820
00:41:41,665 --> 00:41:43,006
And this is a lot of subtle things.

821
00:41:43,026 --> 00:41:46,530
It's just like color choices, and fonts, and the pieces that

822
00:41:46,550 --> 00:41:48,732
they're touching, things like that can really help pull

823
00:41:48,752 --> 00:41:49,333
people into it.

824
00:41:51,459 --> 00:41:53,980
uh... so this one i think again i look for this one every year

825
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:55,721
rolled ice fast game

826
00:41:56,461 --> 00:41:59,543
so i want to show them the power of rewards and like any good teacher used

827
00:41:59,563 --> 00:42:00,484
to this bs skinner

828
00:42:00,504 --> 00:42:04,486
uh... kind of lecture about reward systems and we've all heard these things

829
00:42:04,526 --> 00:42:04,826
before

830
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:06,807
uh... so we know how that lecture goes

831
00:42:07,627 --> 00:42:11,809
and I decided it's kind of, I'd rather actually be BF Skinner

832
00:42:12,089 --> 00:42:13,490
and have the students be my rats.

833
00:42:14,030 --> 00:42:15,471
So I'm going to be, I'm going to stand up front

834
00:42:15,511 --> 00:42:17,832
and I'm going to actually run them through some exercises.

835
00:42:17,852 --> 00:42:18,352
They don't know it.

836
00:42:18,372 --> 00:42:19,672
I was like, hey, let's play a fun game.

837
00:42:20,013 --> 00:42:23,594
Roll double sixes and try to do that as many times as you can.

838
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:26,735
I can get them to do this for over 30 minutes.

839
00:42:26,955 --> 00:42:28,056
My record is an hour.

840
00:42:31,017 --> 00:42:34,619
On top of that, they're standing up the whole time.

841
00:42:35,539 --> 00:42:35,779
They're

842
00:42:36,552 --> 00:42:39,194
more and more engaged as the game goes on.

843
00:42:40,235 --> 00:42:43,538
And it turns out that it's just they're having a great time.

844
00:42:44,178 --> 00:42:49,123
So how it works is you treat them like rats.

845
00:42:49,643 --> 00:42:51,585
So you start out and say, here's a bunch of poker chips.

846
00:42:51,745 --> 00:42:54,207
Every time you roll double sixes, call freeze, and you

847
00:42:54,227 --> 00:42:54,888
get a poker chip.

848
00:42:55,568 --> 00:42:58,411
If somebody else has a seven, when you called freeze, take a

849
00:42:58,431 --> 00:42:59,211
poker chip from them.

850
00:43:00,138 --> 00:43:01,638
That's basically the whole rules of the game.

851
00:43:01,978 --> 00:43:03,239
Now, it's all simultaneous.

852
00:43:03,259 --> 00:43:04,119
You're not taking a turn.

853
00:43:04,979 --> 00:43:09,841
So your only real decision, as it were, is to like, I

854
00:43:09,861 --> 00:43:10,561
don't know if there is one.

855
00:43:10,601 --> 00:43:11,601
You want to roll fast.

856
00:43:11,701 --> 00:43:13,341
Like, if you have a seven on the table, you want to get it

857
00:43:13,402 --> 00:43:13,882
off the table.

858
00:43:13,902 --> 00:43:15,242
If you don't have double sixes, you want to be the one

859
00:43:15,262 --> 00:43:16,002
with the double sixes.

860
00:43:16,462 --> 00:43:18,543
And so that means as soon as they hit, you pick up.

861
00:43:18,583 --> 00:43:19,543
And as soon as you hit, you pick up.

862
00:43:20,523 --> 00:43:22,884
And so we exhaust the pool of poker chips.

863
00:43:22,924 --> 00:43:24,545
We see who has the most, and that person wins.

864
00:43:24,965 --> 00:43:26,265
And a lot of them are like, oh, that's pretty interesting.

865
00:43:26,285 --> 00:43:26,725
That's kind of fun.

866
00:43:27,265 --> 00:43:31,008
It's like, well, as poker chips, you know, like, let's play for cookies.

867
00:43:31,568 --> 00:43:36,271
So I get out the Pepperidge Farm, the really nice ones, you know, don't get just the cheap cookies.

868
00:43:36,291 --> 00:43:37,212
You want to get really nice ones.

869
00:43:37,932 --> 00:43:41,435
And you set them in the—and you blow the scent as you open the bag.

870
00:43:41,455 --> 00:43:42,535
You make sure everybody can smell it.

871
00:43:44,582 --> 00:43:46,103
You try to really get them engaged in that.

872
00:43:46,163 --> 00:43:47,764
And then you say, go for cookies.

873
00:43:48,305 --> 00:43:49,806
So now they say, oh, this game's great.

874
00:43:49,986 --> 00:43:50,627
I love this game.

875
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:51,868
I'm trying to roll sixes.

876
00:43:53,149 --> 00:43:53,969
Then we step it up.

877
00:43:53,989 --> 00:43:56,091
We're like, hey, how about I pull out a bunch of quarters

878
00:43:56,111 --> 00:43:56,611
and throw them down?

879
00:43:56,651 --> 00:43:57,972
We're going to play for real money now.

880
00:43:58,313 --> 00:44:00,194
The thing with cookies is you only really need one or two.

881
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,776
And then you're kind of like, I don't need any more cookies.

882
00:44:03,256 --> 00:44:04,477
But if you're a college student, you

883
00:44:04,577 --> 00:44:05,658
want all the quarters you can get,

884
00:44:05,858 --> 00:44:07,440
especially with the vending machines right down the hall.

885
00:44:09,041 --> 00:44:10,622
So now we play for the quarters.

886
00:44:10,662 --> 00:44:12,564
And by this point, they're really into this game.

887
00:44:12,704 --> 00:44:13,645
So they're like.

888
00:44:13,902 --> 00:44:16,944
this is the best game I've ever played. We should play this every week. I love this game.

889
00:44:16,964 --> 00:44:21,587
I can't wait to play this game with my friends." And it's like, you're rolling double sixes,

890
00:44:21,687 --> 00:44:27,051
okay. And then, of course, I step it up. It's like, all right, it's on. We are, I pull out

891
00:44:27,431 --> 00:44:30,233
20 ones from my pocket and just like throw them down on the table. I was like, this is

892
00:44:30,253 --> 00:44:34,396
the real thing now. That was child's play what you guys were doing. We're deep in this

893
00:44:34,456 --> 00:44:39,679
now. And then, now, at this point, they're just off the wall, like they're loving this

894
00:44:39,719 --> 00:44:40,980
game so much, you know.

895
00:44:42,381 --> 00:44:45,342
So, you know, it's basically I'm showing them that,

896
00:44:45,482 --> 00:44:47,723
hey, you guys are not much different than rats and pigeons

897
00:44:47,783 --> 00:44:48,604
and all those other things.

898
00:44:48,704 --> 00:44:50,745
I can get you to do these things.

899
00:44:50,805 --> 00:44:51,185
It's fun.

900
00:44:52,365 --> 00:44:54,146
Real quick, is anybody in the audience,

901
00:44:54,706 --> 00:44:55,647
one of my students played this game?

902
00:44:56,107 --> 00:44:57,087
I'm curious if there's anybody.

903
00:44:57,187 --> 00:44:57,948
Okay, I don't see anybody.

904
00:44:58,008 --> 00:44:59,348
Sometimes my students show up.

905
00:44:59,508 --> 00:45:00,329
Oh, okay, back there.

906
00:45:00,409 --> 00:45:00,649
All right.

907
00:45:01,849 --> 00:45:02,810
So, what had happened, though,

908
00:45:02,830 --> 00:45:04,851
is I was losing money every time I ran this exercise.

909
00:45:05,791 --> 00:45:15,384
So, and I'm just standing there, and you can imagine me, like, I've got my white lab coat on, and my clipboard, and stupid students, so, you know, I can manipulate them any way I want, I'm so cool.

910
00:45:16,445 --> 00:45:19,769
But I'm losing money, so I'm like, I might as well play, because I can get some of my money back.

911
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:23,074
And it turns out this game is awesome. It really is.

912
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,502
I don't know why, but it's really fun.

913
00:45:28,642 --> 00:45:29,984
And try it yourself and see.

914
00:45:30,044 --> 00:45:31,145
Like, I totally get into it.

915
00:45:31,205 --> 00:45:32,226
I get all excited.

916
00:45:32,266 --> 00:45:33,126
Like, it's amazing.

917
00:45:33,667 --> 00:45:35,969
So the simple things you can do by throwing money at people,

918
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:37,430
it's the power of that.

919
00:45:37,450 --> 00:45:37,871
It's great.

920
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:43,858
All right, so you want to, the other game that we do for atmosphere, and this is what I was talking

921
00:45:43,878 --> 00:45:48,159
about, just the fonts, just the colors, things like that, is I have them just bring in some

922
00:45:48,199 --> 00:45:53,800
board games from home, and we basically just hold up the boxes and say, hey, look at these boxes and

923
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:58,081
tell me how you should feel, how the marketing people, how the graphic designer wants you to

924
00:45:58,121 --> 00:46:02,422
feel, without even opening the box, just describe that to me. What font did they use? What color?

925
00:46:03,283 --> 00:46:06,423
Did they tilt the font? You know, is it kind of jumbled or is it really straight?

926
00:46:07,023 --> 00:46:09,144
Is it cursive font like Trivial Pursuit, things like that.

927
00:46:09,844 --> 00:46:12,006
And then they combine the two games to do a little mashup thing,

928
00:46:12,086 --> 00:46:14,889
where it's just like, take these two games, I randomly put people together,

929
00:46:14,909 --> 00:46:17,731
and they just kind of have fun. This one's a little more open-ended.

930
00:46:17,791 --> 00:46:19,873
It's not really about the game that they come up with.

931
00:46:20,033 --> 00:46:21,535
It's just about talking about the pieces.

932
00:46:21,975 --> 00:46:25,498
So the one rule of the game is they can't use the rules of the game they brought in.

933
00:46:25,538 --> 00:46:27,380
They can only use the pieces. They have to make a new game.

934
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:32,042
So here was the battleship Jenga where you're trying to build a Jenga tower and then, I

935
00:46:32,062 --> 00:46:35,404
guess, blow it up by calling numbers out as they work their way up.

936
00:46:36,144 --> 00:46:39,006
Here though, you can kind of see the difference from what I was talking about.

937
00:46:39,026 --> 00:46:41,787
Like, look at the Jenga font versus look at the battleship font.

938
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:45,589
Like you can clearly see right away the mood they're trying to set without even opening

939
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:46,049
the box.

940
00:46:46,469 --> 00:46:47,630
You know, one's going to be really whimsical.

941
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,651
The other is like, where's that kid over there?

942
00:46:50,971 --> 00:46:52,232
He's like crazy into that game.

943
00:46:55,685 --> 00:46:58,747
This one, StarCraft, the board game combined with Gloom.

944
00:46:59,208 --> 00:47:02,090
If you play that game, it's the game you try to get everybody depressed so they commit suicide.

945
00:47:03,331 --> 00:47:07,155
And so, I guess in this one, you're traveling around the galaxy trying to depress people.

946
00:47:07,235 --> 00:47:07,635
I'm not sure.

947
00:47:10,678 --> 00:47:14,301
Trivial Pursuit combined with this co-op game called Pandemic.

948
00:47:14,361 --> 00:47:15,242
Some of you may have played.

949
00:47:15,262 --> 00:47:17,764
I'm not sure what they ended up with that one.

950
00:47:17,804 --> 00:47:18,345
I can't remember.

951
00:47:19,589 --> 00:47:22,570
And the last one here, this was Settlers of Catan,

952
00:47:23,330 --> 00:47:24,991
plus a game called Tannhauser,

953
00:47:25,131 --> 00:47:26,652
which is a squad-based tactical game.

954
00:47:26,852 --> 00:47:28,232
So they've got these troops running across

955
00:47:28,252 --> 00:47:30,793
their settlers' world, destroyed.

956
00:47:30,813 --> 00:47:33,074
I think they turned the roads into bunkers

957
00:47:33,114 --> 00:47:33,734
or something like that.

958
00:47:34,834 --> 00:47:36,875
So just kind of a fun mix-up thing.

959
00:47:37,175 --> 00:47:38,596
But you can kind of see all these different pieces

960
00:47:38,776 --> 00:47:41,056
and then the moods that can be set by them,

961
00:47:41,677 --> 00:47:43,577
the differences in the packaging alone

962
00:47:43,597 --> 00:47:44,618
and the pieces that you play with

963
00:47:44,778 --> 00:47:46,058
makes a huge difference in immersion

964
00:47:46,138 --> 00:47:46,958
into the game system.

965
00:47:48,734 --> 00:47:53,922
This last one here is the squadron.

966
00:47:53,962 --> 00:47:59,712
So I've been trying to teach probabilities and statistics for a long time in this class

967
00:47:59,752 --> 00:48:02,536
because I think it's really important for game designers as far as...

968
00:48:03,678 --> 00:48:06,919
the interaction, the output of your game. It's really helpful as a game designer to

969
00:48:06,959 --> 00:48:11,279
know what your game can do. And if you only have to wait for play tests, it's too slow.

970
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:16,341
So if you can use math and probability statistics to figure out what your game can output in

971
00:48:16,381 --> 00:48:19,961
advance, that's a huge win. And so I've been trying to teach the students this and it just

972
00:48:20,281 --> 00:48:25,463
usually fails. So I spent some time like, what's the game that teaches probability and

973
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:26,043
statistics?

974
00:48:27,523 --> 00:48:30,845
with no math because a lot of these students, there's usually one or two programmers in the class,

975
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:35,247
but a lot of times it's artists, and as soon as I do any math at all on the whiteboard,

976
00:48:35,327 --> 00:48:36,927
they just fall asleep. It's just amazing.

977
00:48:38,248 --> 00:48:42,670
So, it was really kind of a challenge for a while for me to get to come up with something.

978
00:48:43,250 --> 00:48:45,051
I'm still working on this one, but it's coming along pretty well.

979
00:48:46,512 --> 00:48:50,415
Slowly progressing difficulty, the idea here is I'm going to borrow from my own lessons.

980
00:48:50,435 --> 00:48:55,780
This is kind of another meta part of this talk where I'm using my own design lessons to help make games for the class.

981
00:48:56,800 --> 00:49:02,045
And so the obstacle pong one with the par one, I'm like, let me start with a par one obstacle and then par two,

982
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:06,869
and I'll keep stepping back until I get like the par five problem and then figure that they won the game.

983
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:12,312
of learning math. And then this idea of like let's simulate thousands of play sessions.

984
00:49:12,692 --> 00:49:15,895
Let's not just go by what we find out in the class here.

985
00:49:17,030 --> 00:49:18,872
So here's what I used to do. I used to give them something like this.

986
00:49:19,813 --> 00:49:23,157
And feel free to try to solve this if you want.

987
00:49:23,217 --> 00:49:24,438
You probably want to download the slides.

988
00:49:24,458 --> 00:49:26,440
The answers are in the PowerPoint in the notes thing,

989
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:27,641
but I'm not going to go through it right now.

990
00:49:28,342 --> 00:49:31,104
But this is a very dry, kind of typical math problem you would get

991
00:49:31,365 --> 00:49:33,427
in any math class that you went through through high school,

992
00:49:34,468 --> 00:49:38,732
purposely with a lot of junk in there to get the player or the student

993
00:49:38,752 --> 00:49:40,974
to try to tease out the important bits of information.

994
00:49:42,090 --> 00:49:44,632
and it doesn't really work. Most players, or most, I keep calling them players,

995
00:49:44,972 --> 00:49:47,835
most students, they just don't even do it.

996
00:49:48,255 --> 00:49:49,536
Like, they would never turn in their homework.

997
00:49:50,857 --> 00:49:52,119
So, it's like, what's the simple game?

998
00:49:52,179 --> 00:49:54,200
Okay, here's the simplest game I can think of.

999
00:49:54,260 --> 00:49:55,361
You each have one die.

1000
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:56,763
You're going to roll a die.

1001
00:49:57,243 --> 00:49:58,424
Whoever gets the highest wins.

1002
00:49:58,864 --> 00:50:00,406
Draw that probability table.

1003
00:50:01,563 --> 00:50:05,305
like, well, that's so trivial. I was like, of course, that's easy. Now compute the odds for me.

1004
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:11,507
Well, there's 15 red Xs there and there's 15 black Xs, so the odds are 50-50. Good job.

1005
00:50:11,807 --> 00:50:18,490
Super simple. Par one. Like, you cannot fail this. I guarantee. It's so obvious. So, everybody

1006
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:21,451
comfortable with that? All right, let's move on. I'm going to try not to give you the lecture while

1007
00:50:21,471 --> 00:50:27,854
I'm talking here. Then I give them some stickers. They have to make their own custom die. It has

1008
00:50:27,874 --> 00:50:28,314
to add up to 21.

1009
00:50:29,977 --> 00:50:32,438
but they don't know what everybody else is making. This is an interesting problem.

1010
00:50:32,458 --> 00:50:34,718
I've actually, if anyone of you want to solve it and send me the answer,

1011
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:39,660
is there one die that's better statistically than any other die you could possibly make?

1012
00:50:39,920 --> 00:50:42,361
Or is it like rock, paper, scissors, no matter what die you come up with,

1013
00:50:42,381 --> 00:50:44,222
you can think of a die that beats that?

1014
00:50:44,982 --> 00:50:47,023
And I still haven't really figured the answer myself out.

1015
00:50:47,063 --> 00:50:50,345
I've been trying to get some programmer, somebody to write the program that will do that for me.

1016
00:50:51,545 --> 00:50:54,305
So, you know, you can do these different kinds of dice and play with them.

1017
00:50:54,365 --> 00:50:55,806
And then they have to make the odds table for that.

1018
00:50:56,286 --> 00:50:58,126
So here the white person is a standard die.

1019
00:50:58,146 --> 00:51:00,006
The blue person is modified. There's a little bit.

1020
00:51:00,467 --> 00:51:02,067
Take that same chart, hook them together.

1021
00:51:02,087 --> 00:51:06,288
Oh, that's 16 blue Xs and that's only 15 black Xs.

1022
00:51:06,948 --> 00:51:10,048
So, 48%, 52. The blue die is clearly better.

1023
00:51:10,648 --> 00:51:12,949
But then Mr. Green die comes in,

1024
00:51:13,789 --> 00:51:14,729
mixes things up a bit.

1025
00:51:14,749 --> 00:51:15,969
You know, he comes in and...

1026
00:51:17,130 --> 00:51:19,771
he gets the edge, a big edge, over that blue die.

1027
00:51:20,211 --> 00:51:22,091
So they play with that for a while and try to figure out, like,

1028
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:24,152
whose die was the best and do this little competition.

1029
00:51:25,532 --> 00:51:27,173
Then we move on to number tiles.

1030
00:51:27,533 --> 00:51:30,774
These are unlike a die that you don't know what it's going to be every time.

1031
00:51:30,834 --> 00:51:32,614
The number tiles, we play two ways.

1032
00:51:32,694 --> 00:51:34,435
One, it's just randomized and when you actually get a pick

1033
00:51:35,015 --> 00:51:36,495
and set down the number of your choice.

1034
00:51:36,555 --> 00:51:38,216
But you use it up, you can't use it again.

1035
00:51:38,816 --> 00:51:40,857
And so this table, as you start to use things up,

1036
00:51:41,637 --> 00:51:43,438
well, the first turn, it's 50-50, of course,

1037
00:51:44,758 --> 00:51:47,379
But then, you know, red plays four, black plays two,

1038
00:51:47,900 --> 00:51:51,421
you redo that chart, figure out now on the next turn after that, what are the odds,

1039
00:51:51,561 --> 00:51:53,943
and they start to shift depending on what you play when.

1040
00:51:54,923 --> 00:51:58,565
So as they kind of work their way through the exercise, the chart gets more and more constrained

1041
00:51:59,065 --> 00:52:01,907
until the last turn you know who will win 100% of the time.

1042
00:52:03,556 --> 00:52:06,059
So just kind of work their way through. Again, you can kind of see what I'm doing here.

1043
00:52:06,099 --> 00:52:08,782
It's just like step, step, step, step, step, step, little, little, little, little.

1044
00:52:08,922 --> 00:52:10,023
And we're not really doing any math.

1045
00:52:10,363 --> 00:52:11,645
Then the real game comes in.

1046
00:52:12,165 --> 00:52:14,207
And the real game here is I get these little spaceships to them,

1047
00:52:14,228 --> 00:52:16,190
and I give them two four-sided dice,

1048
00:52:16,210 --> 00:52:19,053
a six-sided, and a ten-sided.

1049
00:52:19,513 --> 00:52:22,396
And say, you have engines, weapons, and shields.

1050
00:52:24,673 --> 00:52:28,054
when you first attack, you roll the weapon, or you roll the movement, and whoever rolls

1051
00:52:28,094 --> 00:52:31,695
the movement the highest gets to roll two weapons. The person with the lowest movement

1052
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,997
only gets to roll one weapon. And then you're trying to roll higher than their shield roll.

1053
00:52:35,557 --> 00:52:38,458
So again, this is kind of a fun little problem. It's like, what is the best ship configuration?

1054
00:52:38,818 --> 00:52:41,719
Like, should you have fast movement so you get to roll two weapons? And then you can

1055
00:52:41,739 --> 00:52:44,780
have lower weapons, you know. And so, there's like a lot of different ways to think about

1056
00:52:44,820 --> 00:52:44,860
it.

1057
00:52:46,261 --> 00:52:47,402
We then play this game.

1058
00:52:47,422 --> 00:52:49,503
I go around the room and say,

1059
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:50,884
which ship was the best?

1060
00:52:50,904 --> 00:52:52,225
Because they fight everybody else's ship

1061
00:52:52,285 --> 00:52:53,746
and they kind of keep track of whose was better.

1062
00:52:54,227 --> 00:52:55,308
And they all say something different.

1063
00:52:55,328 --> 00:52:56,989
It's like, oh, movement's clearly better.

1064
00:52:57,129 --> 00:52:58,130
No way, weapons are better.

1065
00:52:58,190 --> 00:52:59,050
Oh, shields are much better.

1066
00:52:59,591 --> 00:53:00,872
And that's kind of what I hope happens

1067
00:53:00,972 --> 00:53:02,893
because the sample size is so low

1068
00:53:03,594 --> 00:53:05,535
that they jump, but they jump to conclusions anyway.

1069
00:53:05,555 --> 00:53:07,717
And I see this happen even at my work all the time

1070
00:53:07,757 --> 00:53:09,218
of people with a sample size of one

1071
00:53:09,578 --> 00:53:10,799
telling you that your game is broken.

1072
00:53:12,280 --> 00:53:15,981
So, you know, you want to get them to like, hey, do we really know this is true?

1073
00:53:16,001 --> 00:53:19,742
Then, you know, open my laptop, I have this little Excel spreadsheet, we type in the ship,

1074
00:53:19,882 --> 00:53:23,143
we type in the numbers on the ships and I can actually tell them and simulate like,

1075
00:53:23,423 --> 00:53:29,185
you know what, no, you know, in this case, the blue ship will do 76 damage over 100 attacks,

1076
00:53:29,265 --> 00:53:31,366
where the red ship, the B ship, will do 86 damage.

1077
00:53:32,927 --> 00:53:36,249
clearly the red chip is better than the other one.

1078
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:40,593
So, just kind of showing them that the power of being able to actually clearly know the

1079
00:53:40,693 --> 00:53:42,934
answer instead of just using a small sample set.

1080
00:53:43,295 --> 00:53:45,917
And I think that series of kind of stepping through is actually pretty successful.

1081
00:53:45,937 --> 00:53:49,439
I'm still kind of tuning this stuff and different things with it, but it's actually showing

1082
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:49,940
some promise.

1083
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:51,601
All right.

1084
00:53:51,661 --> 00:53:52,882
So, let me wrap up here.

1085
00:53:52,902 --> 00:53:54,503
I'm getting kind of down to the final few minutes.

1086
00:53:56,318 --> 00:54:01,600
Putting it all together, towards the end of the semester, we start combining all these

1087
00:54:01,660 --> 00:54:06,662
ideas once we get the basics all figured out. And there's a lot of games. Actually, when

1088
00:54:06,682 --> 00:54:09,923
I was going through trying to pick the games for this talk, I realized how many of these

1089
00:54:09,983 --> 00:54:14,424
I have. I have, like, at least another 10, 20 that I could have pulled out. Most of them

1090
00:54:14,444 --> 00:54:18,946
start to fall in towards the end where we're just talking about all those ideas and building

1091
00:54:19,006 --> 00:54:22,727
upon them. I'll just use this one as an example because it touches on a lot of the different

1092
00:54:22,747 --> 00:54:24,268
things, the casino exercise.

1093
00:54:25,148 --> 00:54:27,810
You know, you want to, you've got to make a casino game.

1094
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:29,851
Better have a really obvious goal.

1095
00:54:30,451 --> 00:54:32,653
Better have some really interesting decisions to get the player there.

1096
00:54:32,793 --> 00:54:33,653
It needs simple rules.

1097
00:54:33,673 --> 00:54:36,155
You don't want somebody spending a lot of time trying to figure out the rule systems.

1098
00:54:37,816 --> 00:54:40,998
Use reward and atmosphere to entice players to play your game.

1099
00:54:41,779 --> 00:54:43,360
But you need to make a profit.

1100
00:54:43,880 --> 00:54:47,064
So you actually need to make more money than you're giving away in rewards.

1101
00:54:47,365 --> 00:54:50,008
So they go, again, they go off to their own separate rooms as little teams.

1102
00:54:50,309 --> 00:54:52,772
They build these casino games, and we pull them all back together.

1103
00:54:52,852 --> 00:54:55,255
We take over the lunchroom, and we turn it into a casino.

1104
00:54:55,275 --> 00:54:59,921
And this is always dangerous when the dean happens to make a surprise trip in on Saturday.

1105
00:55:00,542 --> 00:55:02,523
and everybody's rolling dice and cards and poker chips

1106
00:55:02,563 --> 00:55:03,624
everywhere and lots of noise.

1107
00:55:04,344 --> 00:55:07,646
Also, there's always a few students in on Saturday

1108
00:55:07,686 --> 00:55:09,628
from other classes, especially towards the end of the semester

1109
00:55:09,668 --> 00:55:10,168
with finals.

1110
00:55:10,588 --> 00:55:12,049
And so when they come down the hall

1111
00:55:12,069 --> 00:55:13,090
to see what all the noise is about,

1112
00:55:13,130 --> 00:55:14,130
I give them a stack of chips.

1113
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:15,431
I'm like, come on in.

1114
00:55:15,451 --> 00:55:17,973
This is where it's happening.

1115
00:55:18,133 --> 00:55:19,074
Come on and spend these chips.

1116
00:55:19,134 --> 00:55:21,135
And then you get this kind of outside view.

1117
00:55:21,855 --> 00:55:22,836
So there's really two goals.

1118
00:55:22,876 --> 00:55:24,817
There's like the winning house, the house

1119
00:55:24,857 --> 00:55:25,698
that makes the most money.

1120
00:55:26,718 --> 00:55:29,560
And they get a special reward trophy for winning.

1121
00:55:30,220 --> 00:55:33,161
And then the winning player, the one who can take advantage of the most systems.

1122
00:55:33,201 --> 00:55:38,003
So you have your house stash and your own personal stash.

1123
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:42,264
I won't go into these in detail, but just a few of them.

1124
00:55:42,324 --> 00:55:46,006
This is a pirate-type game where you're trying to sink ships

1125
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:47,846
and you deal random cards onto the ships.

1126
00:55:49,867 --> 00:55:53,228
This one was a, I think, Uncharted Ruins or something like that,

1127
00:55:53,248 --> 00:55:55,829
where you're exploring these different temples for gems.

1128
00:55:57,337 --> 00:56:00,779
basically rolling dice, trying to fit them into certain packages.

1129
00:56:01,099 --> 00:56:03,160
Big Payout was this game. It's just a simple board.

1130
00:56:03,180 --> 00:56:03,800
You're trying to move around.

1131
00:56:03,820 --> 00:56:06,942
You can cash out along the way as you work your way to the final goal,

1132
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:09,764
or you can risk it all to keep going to the next cash-out spot

1133
00:56:10,064 --> 00:56:11,365
until you get to the Big Payout.

1134
00:56:11,385 --> 00:56:12,866
And they would actually, like, kind of yell that,

1135
00:56:12,886 --> 00:56:14,586
Who wants Big Payout? Come over here!

1136
00:56:14,627 --> 00:56:15,567
And try to, like, pull...

1137
00:56:15,587 --> 00:56:17,028
They're like carnival barkers, almost.

1138
00:56:17,048 --> 00:56:18,469
They're really trying to, like, actively

1139
00:56:18,749 --> 00:56:20,170
pull people's money into their systems.

1140
00:56:21,850 --> 00:56:25,512
And this one, Don't Wake the Dragon, another kind of risk-reward game where you're grabbing

1141
00:56:25,552 --> 00:56:27,913
dragon gold, but he may wake up at any moment and eat you.

1142
00:56:28,853 --> 00:56:31,174
So a lot of different things that they have a lot of fun with this one.

1143
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:34,935
But it kind of stresses all the different things about rewards and decisions and goals

1144
00:56:35,015 --> 00:56:38,456
and everything and putting it all together. All right.

1145
00:56:38,536 --> 00:56:43,218
So we've got just a couple minutes here. Let me just wrap up with a few final thoughts

1146
00:56:43,258 --> 00:56:43,698
of all of this.

1147
00:56:46,564 --> 00:56:48,229
just spent an hour talking about these games,

1148
00:56:48,931 --> 00:56:51,177
take what you want from them from this talk.

1149
00:56:52,042 --> 00:56:55,323
but play them if you really want to understand what I'm talking about.

1150
00:56:55,723 --> 00:57:00,285
So, you know, listening to me talk about games is not the same as what I'm saying you should be doing.

1151
00:57:01,446 --> 00:57:06,348
But don't take what I made as like, oh, Stone said this is the game, we can't change the rules.

1152
00:57:06,628 --> 00:57:07,328
Just the opposite.

1153
00:57:07,749 --> 00:57:14,252
Like, make it your own, do whatever you can to make that game meet the needs or teach you the lesson.

1154
00:57:14,312 --> 00:57:16,653
You know, as a game designer, I make these games and...

1155
00:57:17,253 --> 00:57:21,878
They're simple, they're so simple, but I learn from them every single year that I teach these.

1156
00:57:22,458 --> 00:57:25,421
I've been doing this stuff for 10 years now, and I still learn new things.

1157
00:57:25,481 --> 00:57:26,342
It always surprises me.

1158
00:57:27,143 --> 00:57:31,328
So, you know, you can't stop learning, you can't drill on the fundamentals,

1159
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:34,831
because there's a lot there, there's a lot of richness there that keeps revealing itself

1160
00:57:34,931 --> 00:57:38,075
that comes into these big complicated games, these million-dollar games that we make.

1161
00:57:39,317 --> 00:57:42,919
And then finally, my last point here is if you are a designer and everything that I talked

1162
00:57:42,939 --> 00:57:46,120
about in this talk is like, yeah, I understand all that, that's cool, like, you know, you

1163
00:57:46,140 --> 00:57:49,763
didn't really tell me anything new I didn't already know, then you should be a teacher.

1164
00:57:50,643 --> 00:57:57,287
Go out, I'm not saying like go down, thank you, I'm not saying go down to your college

1165
00:57:57,307 --> 00:58:02,810
or whatever and sign up to be a professor, go to your QA department and say, hey, who

1166
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:06,032
wants to learn more about game design? And I bet almost everybody in that QA department

1167
00:58:06,052 --> 00:58:06,752
will raise their hand.

1168
00:58:07,793 --> 00:58:08,714
just take a lunchtime

1169
00:58:08,734 --> 00:58:10,236
home over to a lunch table

1170
00:58:10,576 --> 00:58:12,698
haven't play a game with you one of these games are really simple

1171
00:58:13,178 --> 00:58:17,141
and you can educate uh... you know it's a it's a two-way thing and by educating

1172
00:58:17,161 --> 00:58:18,042
you'll learn trust me

1173
00:58:18,675 --> 00:58:19,675
All right, so I'll leave it at that.

1174
00:58:21,837 --> 00:58:24,339
All the games, I'm going to hopefully next week have them

1175
00:58:24,439 --> 00:58:26,180
up on my website at stonetronics.com.

1176
00:58:26,200 --> 00:58:29,543
So you'll be able to download PDFs of all of this stuff, all

1177
00:58:29,563 --> 00:58:30,724
the rules, everything should be there.

1178
00:58:30,744 --> 00:58:32,565
But they're not there yet unless you really want to dig

1179
00:58:32,605 --> 00:58:34,747
around because I've run these exercises in the past.

1180
00:58:35,127 --> 00:58:36,548
So a lot of them are up there, but you have to search.

1181
00:58:36,588 --> 00:58:38,509
If you wait a week, they'll all be in one nice folder.

1182
00:58:39,350 --> 00:58:40,311
And I'll leave it at that.

1183
00:58:40,651 --> 00:58:42,793
I don't think we have time for questions, unfortunately.

1184
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:45,174
But feel free to come up afterwards if you want to talk

1185
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:45,575
about this.

1186
00:58:46,035 --> 00:58:46,255
Thank you.
