1
00:00:06,855 --> 00:00:09,437
Hey everyone, thanks for coming to our talk today.

2
00:00:09,938 --> 00:00:12,179
My name's Teddy Lee and I'm the game designer

3
00:00:12,199 --> 00:00:13,120
for Cellar Door Games.

4
00:00:13,781 --> 00:00:15,242
And I'm Kenny Lee, the programmer.

5
00:00:16,042 --> 00:00:17,203
If you guys don't know, we're brothers.

6
00:00:19,636 --> 00:00:24,478
So we're here today to give a post-mortem on Rogue Legacy with an emphasis on budget

7
00:00:24,518 --> 00:00:29,640
design. For those who don't know, Rogue Legacy is a casual man's roguelike. Even though many

8
00:00:29,680 --> 00:00:34,302
people still find it very difficult, it's far more accessible because we added permanency

9
00:00:34,342 --> 00:00:39,844
to the game. So in this game, every time you die, all the money you found, you get to spend

10
00:00:39,884 --> 00:00:44,686
to improve your family. And I say family because with each death, you never play the same hero

11
00:00:44,726 --> 00:00:46,967
twice. Instead, your children succeed you.

12
00:00:52,718 --> 00:00:55,981
To start, we consider ourselves to be a budget-oriented team.

13
00:00:56,582 --> 00:00:58,143
That means we focus more on gameplay

14
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,686
rather than trying to make expensive, highly detailed

15
00:01:00,726 --> 00:01:00,986
worlds.

16
00:01:01,747 --> 00:01:03,868
That also means we're always on the lookout for solutions

17
00:01:03,889 --> 00:01:06,231
that are cheap, fast, and reusable.

18
00:01:07,272 --> 00:01:09,093
So we often implement solutions that

19
00:01:09,213 --> 00:01:11,736
aren't as good if the cost savings are justified.

20
00:01:12,356 --> 00:01:14,038
That also means we'll never make the perfect game,

21
00:01:14,398 --> 00:01:15,559
but we're OK with that.

22
00:01:20,197 --> 00:01:21,838
So we've been doing this for a long time now.

23
00:01:22,178 --> 00:01:23,579
A lot of people think Rogue Legacy

24
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:25,900
was our first foray into game development,

25
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:28,341
but we've actually made eight games before this.

26
00:01:29,202 --> 00:01:31,143
On average, each of these games cost us

27
00:01:31,463 --> 00:01:33,924
about $1,000 to make, with development time

28
00:01:33,984 --> 00:01:36,185
ranging from two days to three and a half months.

29
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:38,226
And it's through this experience

30
00:01:38,266 --> 00:01:40,067
that we are really able to solidify

31
00:01:40,127 --> 00:01:41,328
how we go about making games.

32
00:01:41,848 --> 00:01:43,469
So you might recognize some of the games

33
00:01:43,489 --> 00:01:45,590
that are available on Flash and mobile.

34
00:01:49,469 --> 00:01:51,410
So this is our development timeline for Rogue Legacy.

35
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:54,190
As you can see, it starts out with me working

36
00:01:54,230 --> 00:01:56,431
on the project solo, and as time went by,

37
00:01:56,611 --> 00:01:58,011
more and more people joined the project.

38
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:01,212
For Rogue Legacy, it took us a year and a half

39
00:02:01,232 --> 00:02:03,313
to make the game, and I was the only person

40
00:02:03,353 --> 00:02:05,173
who worked on it full-time from start to finish.

41
00:02:05,913 --> 00:02:08,274
Teddy actually came on full-time five months

42
00:02:08,654 --> 00:02:10,995
before release, and everyone else was contracted.

43
00:02:14,829 --> 00:02:16,310
So this is Rogue Legacy by the numbers.

44
00:02:16,930 --> 00:02:18,191
As I mentioned in the previous slide,

45
00:02:18,231 --> 00:02:20,073
it took us a year and a half to develop the game.

46
00:02:20,973 --> 00:02:23,555
And in total, our out-of-pocket costs for the project

47
00:02:23,595 --> 00:02:24,115
was less than $15,000.

48
00:02:24,315 --> 00:02:28,558
So that's still a lot of money compared to the $1,000

49
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,099
for our previous projects,

50
00:02:30,259 --> 00:02:31,860
but if you consider the scope of the game,

51
00:02:32,281 --> 00:02:35,023
I think we did a pretty good job of keeping the costs down.

52
00:02:35,993 --> 00:02:37,775
When the game went up for sale, we were able to cover

53
00:02:37,895 --> 00:02:39,916
all of our development costs in less than an hour.

54
00:02:40,837 --> 00:02:42,638
And within the first week, we were able to sell

55
00:02:42,678 --> 00:02:44,259
over 100,000 copies of the game,

56
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:47,061
which is well beyond anything we had ever anticipated.

57
00:02:51,104 --> 00:02:52,825
To show how seriously we take budget,

58
00:02:53,065 --> 00:02:54,786
we need to talk about Rogue Legacy's beginnings.

59
00:02:55,767 --> 00:02:58,289
Rogue Legacy was actually never meant to be a roguelike.

60
00:02:58,909 --> 00:03:01,331
Instead, it was a matchup of three games

61
00:03:01,351 --> 00:03:02,231
you might be familiar with.

62
00:03:03,032 --> 00:03:04,553
It had the death system of Dark Souls,

63
00:03:05,494 --> 00:03:09,115
the platforming of Castlevania and the cartography system of Etrian Odyssey.

64
00:03:10,475 --> 00:03:13,196
And it had virtually no roguelike elements in it.

65
00:03:13,816 --> 00:03:18,117
It was a game of crazy scope that emphasized exploration and puzzle solving.

66
00:03:22,657 --> 00:03:27,678
So this is Dark Souls 2D, the first build of our original non-roguelike game.

67
00:03:28,139 --> 00:03:30,499
And it took, at this point, about three months to make.

68
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:42,249
Oh, sorry.

69
00:03:42,289 --> 00:03:45,972
So as you can see in this game, none of it's procedural.

70
00:03:46,012 --> 00:03:48,294
Every single room's been handcrafted.

71
00:03:49,595 --> 00:03:52,177
And all of the art assets is just Castlevania.

72
00:03:52,197 --> 00:03:53,758
You might recognize some of that.

73
00:03:53,958 --> 00:03:55,699
Yeah, we just wear our inspirations on our sleeve.

74
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,001
But what you can't tell is that.

75
00:03:58,482 --> 00:04:00,863
We only spent a week and a half actually making content.

76
00:04:01,003 --> 00:04:03,504
Everything else was like building up the engine and everything.

77
00:04:03,924 --> 00:04:07,586
And it took over five minutes to go from one end of the game to the other.

78
00:04:07,646 --> 00:04:08,907
So it was pretty massive.

79
00:04:09,447 --> 00:04:14,010
And we actually already had eight enemies in the game and five different mini bosses.

80
00:04:14,830 --> 00:04:17,832
Yeah, so you can't see that very much in this video because it's all separated,

81
00:04:17,852 --> 00:04:21,153
but there was quite a bit of content for just three months of work.

82
00:04:23,049 --> 00:04:28,054
So, what you can see here is actually the original fairy chest rooms, which were rooms

83
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:32,138
that you'd enter and have a very highly difficult challenge that you had to overcome to get

84
00:04:32,178 --> 00:04:32,819
a special item.

85
00:04:33,339 --> 00:04:37,303
And for those who've actually played Rogue Legacy, this is one of the bosses which actually

86
00:04:37,463 --> 00:04:40,366
went from prototype to final with very little change in it.

87
00:04:42,709 --> 00:04:44,110
This is just a platforming test room.

88
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:45,571
I don't know why I added this.

89
00:04:45,772 --> 00:04:47,593
Yeah, just to test like jump heights and stuff.

90
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:53,821
In any case, at this point we were feeling pretty good

91
00:04:53,861 --> 00:04:55,682
because it was already starting to feel like a game.

92
00:04:56,323 --> 00:04:57,784
In fact, it was even kind of fun to play.

93
00:04:58,465 --> 00:05:01,007
So we did what any developer would do in our position.

94
00:05:04,009 --> 00:05:04,829
We killed the project.

95
00:05:06,511 --> 00:05:08,312
At this point, we were able to better evaluate

96
00:05:08,332 --> 00:05:10,614
the costs for the game and came to the fatal conclusion

97
00:05:10,674 --> 00:05:12,795
that we simply could not afford to make it.

98
00:05:13,656 --> 00:05:14,817
It was a tough pill to swallow,

99
00:05:15,097 --> 00:05:17,439
but our experience working on all of our previous games

100
00:05:17,939 --> 00:05:19,961
made us fairly certain about those projections.

101
00:05:21,287 --> 00:05:23,169
So from here we had to go into salvage mode

102
00:05:23,689 --> 00:05:25,711
and try to build a game from the scraps.

103
00:05:26,251 --> 00:05:28,453
We had a basic 2D platforming engine,

104
00:05:28,773 --> 00:05:31,014
an AI logic system, and a level editor

105
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:31,935
that could create rooms.

106
00:05:32,876 --> 00:05:34,757
And that's when we decided to make Rogue Legacy.

107
00:05:35,778 --> 00:05:38,780
Procedurally generated rooms resolved our biggest bottleneck,

108
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,662
which was art, while opening up the strength of our tools,

109
00:05:41,722 --> 00:05:42,943
which is rapid level development.

110
00:05:43,745 --> 00:05:46,186
It was also a natural extension from Dark Souls 2D,

111
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,847
since a lot of the appeal to Dark Souls

112
00:05:49,047 --> 00:05:53,049
is its semi-rogue-like concept of consequence upon death,

113
00:05:53,089 --> 00:05:54,470
where when you die, you drop your souls

114
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:55,991
and you have an opportunity to pick them up again.

115
00:05:56,731 --> 00:05:58,952
It's similar to Rogue-likes, but it's not as punishing.

116
00:06:01,974 --> 00:06:02,834
So here's another video.

117
00:06:03,255 --> 00:06:06,416
This is Rogue Legacy.

118
00:06:06,896 --> 00:06:08,277
After canceling the first project,

119
00:06:08,357 --> 00:06:10,558
this version was created two and a half weeks later.

120
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:19,315
any day now. Okay, so to really signify new beginnings, we

121
00:06:19,395 --> 00:06:22,258
removed all of the placeholder art and replaced it with my

122
00:06:22,278 --> 00:06:23,299
amazing programmer art.

123
00:06:28,618 --> 00:06:31,900
So what you can't see here is, in the previous video

124
00:06:31,940 --> 00:06:34,402
we said that the world was stitched together.

125
00:06:35,262 --> 00:06:37,483
In this one it was procedurally stitched together

126
00:06:37,503 --> 00:06:38,584
by the system.

127
00:06:38,964 --> 00:06:40,985
So it's pretty much the same logic

128
00:06:41,085 --> 00:06:43,567
as the retail version of Rogue Legacy,

129
00:06:43,887 --> 00:06:45,168
but you can't tell in the videos.

130
00:06:46,368 --> 00:06:48,650
And for some reason we also spent the time

131
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:51,271
implementing a lot of new enemy types.

132
00:06:52,112 --> 00:06:54,173
I guess we didn't really have our priorities set straight.

133
00:06:56,679 --> 00:06:59,743
And we also had things like new zones running in the game.

134
00:06:59,783 --> 00:07:01,486
So I think, yeah, you can see a new zone here

135
00:07:01,887 --> 00:07:06,915
with new enemies that have amazing AI stuck in a corner.

136
00:07:15,888 --> 00:07:17,909
Because Buzzard drives us, we try to salvage

137
00:07:17,949 --> 00:07:18,690
as much as we could.

138
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,111
And in the end, we surprisingly managed

139
00:07:21,131 --> 00:07:23,152
to salvage everything from our previous project.

140
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:26,033
And this was about a year before the game launched.

141
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:27,874
We were able to launch so quickly,

142
00:07:27,934 --> 00:07:29,714
despite the setbacks that we encountered,

143
00:07:30,015 --> 00:07:32,356
because we embraced the new direction immediately

144
00:07:32,756 --> 00:07:34,436
and pulled the scope down with no regrets.

145
00:07:42,664 --> 00:07:44,145
But the challenges didn't end there.

146
00:07:44,726 --> 00:07:47,088
We like to put twists on the genres we work on,

147
00:07:47,248 --> 00:07:50,272
so we decided to make a more casual roguelike experience.

148
00:07:50,932 --> 00:07:52,714
This meant changing some of the most common tenets

149
00:07:52,754 --> 00:07:53,655
found in roguelike games.

150
00:07:57,114 --> 00:08:01,035
So the first thing we wanted to fix was the harsh punishment of deaths.

151
00:08:01,795 --> 00:08:05,856
But for us, we didn't want to just make deaths less painful, we wanted to try and make it

152
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:06,456
fun.

153
00:08:06,956 --> 00:08:11,837
So that's when we decided to add permanency to the game by using the mainer skill tree

154
00:08:11,897 --> 00:08:12,777
and the equipment system.

155
00:08:13,337 --> 00:08:15,817
That way you never had to start from scratch.

156
00:08:16,637 --> 00:08:20,578
It was a contentious decision because we knew we were dilating the spirit of roguelikes,

157
00:08:21,098 --> 00:08:24,419
where usually when you die you kind of have to start all the way from the beginning, even

158
00:08:24,459 --> 00:08:26,439
if your run was 10 minutes or 50 minutes long.

159
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:34,297
We also wanted our game to be more skill-based and less chance.

160
00:08:34,877 --> 00:08:38,800
So in a lot of roguelike games, there's a big emphasis on the roll of the dice.

161
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:42,542
So you could have critical misses or instant death events,

162
00:08:43,002 --> 00:08:45,443
and we wanted to remove as much of that as possible.

163
00:08:45,944 --> 00:08:49,826
So we did a lot of tweaks to the game, especially inside the castle generation system,

164
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:51,747
to make sure everything was fun and fair.

165
00:08:52,467 --> 00:08:57,035
We still do have some random roles, but for example in critical strikes,

166
00:08:57,636 --> 00:09:00,361
but whenever it's just beneficial to the player, we're okay with that.

167
00:09:05,073 --> 00:09:07,914
So the other thing we wanted to do was reduce obscurity.

168
00:09:08,674 --> 00:09:11,335
Roguelikes often go out of their way to obscure information

169
00:09:11,375 --> 00:09:13,216
so that players can kind of discover the world.

170
00:09:13,957 --> 00:09:15,057
While some people enjoy that,

171
00:09:15,397 --> 00:09:16,998
we wanted to make our game more transparent

172
00:09:17,078 --> 00:09:18,078
and easier to memorize.

173
00:09:18,518 --> 00:09:20,879
So a lot of the pointless obfuscation stuff

174
00:09:20,899 --> 00:09:23,260
like 50 potions which are only labeled by color,

175
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:25,741
we wanted to remove all of those instances.

176
00:09:26,282 --> 00:09:29,308
This is why we have descriptions for virtually everything in the game.

177
00:09:29,629 --> 00:09:33,878
Some of them are flat out explained, while others just provide hints so that the second

178
00:09:33,918 --> 00:09:35,502
time around you more or less know what it does.

179
00:09:39,799 --> 00:09:42,080
Fourthly, we wanted to make the game faster and shorter.

180
00:09:42,581 --> 00:09:45,542
So, in most roguelikes, the first few minutes of play

181
00:09:46,323 --> 00:09:47,263
are usually the same.

182
00:09:48,044 --> 00:09:49,805
You need to start to power up

183
00:09:49,845 --> 00:09:52,046
before you begin to take on unique characteristics.

184
00:09:52,746 --> 00:09:55,588
We wanted to fix that, so we designed the lineage system

185
00:09:55,648 --> 00:09:57,769
to upfront all change to the very start of the game.

186
00:09:58,649 --> 00:10:00,651
This was important because we wanted to make our games

187
00:10:00,711 --> 00:10:02,492
to be very easy to pick up and play,

188
00:10:02,512 --> 00:10:04,993
and that meant we wanted to make the average life

189
00:10:05,053 --> 00:10:05,953
last around one minute.

190
00:10:06,294 --> 00:10:07,955
So if you die a lot playing this game,

191
00:10:08,035 --> 00:10:09,255
don't worry, that was by design.

192
00:10:11,494 --> 00:10:13,835
But these short lives also mean a lot of streamlining.

193
00:10:14,356 --> 00:10:16,977
Because we didn't want people to play for 40 seconds

194
00:10:16,997 --> 00:10:18,559
and then they had to spend the next two minutes

195
00:10:19,259 --> 00:10:20,240
navigating menus again,

196
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,282
we had to just streamline absolutely everything.

197
00:10:23,642 --> 00:10:25,563
So an example of that can be seen as the trade names.

198
00:10:26,064 --> 00:10:27,645
They're all purposely very distinct,

199
00:10:28,005 --> 00:10:29,706
so you can recognize them at a glance

200
00:10:29,826 --> 00:10:31,007
and not have to read them every time.

201
00:10:32,057 --> 00:10:35,619
It's kind of why we flip-flop between scientific terminology and slang.

202
00:10:36,319 --> 00:10:41,261
So an example of that is hypergonadism, which if you have that trait, it means you hit enemies

203
00:10:41,321 --> 00:10:42,042
really far back.

204
00:10:42,182 --> 00:10:46,004
And we had the inverse trait, which was hypogonadism, so enemies wouldn't get knocked back at all.

205
00:10:46,624 --> 00:10:49,825
But if you were playing the game and you'd see these traits, you'd actually have to like

206
00:10:50,165 --> 00:10:53,167
stop and then read the word out entirely because they're so similar.

207
00:10:53,667 --> 00:10:57,529
So in this example, we turned hypogonadism into muscle weakness, just so that it's visually

208
00:10:57,569 --> 00:10:57,909
distinct.

209
00:11:06,021 --> 00:11:09,382
The next point is that we wanted to remove floor clearing from the game.

210
00:11:10,122 --> 00:11:14,604
So a lot of roguelikes segment their games into floors, where the further you go, the

211
00:11:14,744 --> 00:11:15,605
harder it gets.

212
00:11:16,445 --> 00:11:21,187
But if you bypass a floor without clearing it out entirely, enemies will start to outscale

213
00:11:21,227 --> 00:11:23,628
the player, putting you at a disadvantage.

214
00:11:24,348 --> 00:11:27,410
So this floor clearing really slows the game down

215
00:11:27,530 --> 00:11:29,850
and limits players' choice on how they want to progress

216
00:11:29,870 --> 00:11:31,831
through the game, since there's really only one true route

217
00:11:31,871 --> 00:11:32,471
that you can take.

218
00:11:33,132 --> 00:11:34,732
And so we were able to resolve this

219
00:11:34,832 --> 00:11:37,213
by removing all forms of character development

220
00:11:37,273 --> 00:11:38,513
during a run inside the castle.

221
00:11:43,894 --> 00:11:46,015
So this is our last point, and it was actually

222
00:11:46,055 --> 00:11:48,155
the first decision we ever made for Rogue Legacy,

223
00:11:48,535 --> 00:11:50,476
and the primary reason we were able to stay on budget.

224
00:11:50,956 --> 00:11:52,637
So we call it the game loop,

225
00:11:52,897 --> 00:11:55,417
and it explains how players go through one life.

226
00:11:55,998 --> 00:11:58,078
And this term might actually mean something in game design,

227
00:11:58,178 --> 00:12:00,779
but I don't know, we've never like read any books

228
00:12:00,819 --> 00:12:02,179
or anything on this type of stuff.

229
00:12:04,180 --> 00:12:05,580
So it looks like a fairly standard loop,

230
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,001
except the RPG mechanics happen after death

231
00:12:08,141 --> 00:12:09,461
and before you explore the castle,

232
00:12:10,102 --> 00:12:11,782
instead of during play like most games.

233
00:12:12,777 --> 00:12:14,699
It seems like a minor change, however,

234
00:12:14,879 --> 00:12:17,181
almost all the previous design decisions that we spoke of

235
00:12:17,241 --> 00:12:18,361
were built to support this.

236
00:12:18,962 --> 00:12:21,083
So by putting RPG mechanics after death,

237
00:12:21,443 --> 00:12:23,385
you had something to look forward to, which made it fun.

238
00:12:23,945 --> 00:12:25,346
And because no character development

239
00:12:25,386 --> 00:12:27,648
happened during gameplay, we could lessen downtime

240
00:12:27,708 --> 00:12:29,469
and resolve the issues related to floor clearing.

241
00:12:29,929 --> 00:12:32,531
And best of all, it gives you that one more time feel.

242
00:12:37,595 --> 00:12:39,116
This is what we had eight months later.

243
00:12:43,595 --> 00:12:44,855
So some of you might recognize it,

244
00:12:44,915 --> 00:12:46,675
it's actually very similar to our final build.

245
00:12:47,215 --> 00:12:49,616
So with the title screen, we had like a start menu

246
00:12:49,676 --> 00:12:51,696
and a load menu, and we actually took that out

247
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:54,717
for the final version because, like we spoke earlier,

248
00:12:54,737 --> 00:12:56,377
we were so focused on streamlining

249
00:12:56,677 --> 00:12:58,817
that we took out any sort of step

250
00:12:58,837 --> 00:13:00,258
that we thought might impede players

251
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:02,138
into getting to the game as fast as possible.

252
00:13:03,558 --> 00:13:06,559
This was actually our IGF 2013 build.

253
00:13:07,559 --> 00:13:09,099
We're not particularly happy with it

254
00:13:09,179 --> 00:13:11,119
because it's missing a ton of the features

255
00:13:11,619 --> 00:13:12,840
that the final game does have.

256
00:13:14,206 --> 00:13:16,047
But I think you can see, generally,

257
00:13:16,067 --> 00:13:20,589
it's much closer to what Rogue Legacy is now

258
00:13:20,689 --> 00:13:23,650
than what we had in the previous build

259
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:24,951
with my amazing art.

260
00:13:29,633 --> 00:13:32,134
So some of the art you might see is a little bit strange

261
00:13:32,154 --> 00:13:33,275
because this is not final art.

262
00:13:33,615 --> 00:13:35,436
And we actually touched upon that in a later slide.

263
00:13:35,796 --> 00:13:36,776
And we do have all the...

264
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:41,242
different areas working. In this build we actually had six areas.

265
00:13:42,163 --> 00:13:47,409
We in the end decided to cut it down to four because it made more sense with the top, bottom, and

266
00:13:47,490 --> 00:13:50,333
right areas, and along with the center and the left being the

267
00:13:51,014 --> 00:13:51,354
entrance.

268
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:54,608
Oh, I love this part.

269
00:13:55,089 --> 00:13:56,630
This is our previous death system.

270
00:13:57,030 --> 00:13:58,671
So whenever you die, it's really cool,

271
00:13:59,071 --> 00:14:00,392
a whole bunch of enemies and coins

272
00:14:00,412 --> 00:14:03,414
would start raining down depending on your performance.

273
00:14:03,854 --> 00:14:05,095
The reason why we couldn't keep it, though,

274
00:14:05,115 --> 00:14:09,358
is because people who had some really, really epic quests,

275
00:14:09,598 --> 00:14:11,119
that the enemy would just fall forever.

276
00:14:11,659 --> 00:14:14,381
And if we added more enemies dropping to the screen,

277
00:14:14,501 --> 00:14:17,203
we found that it would start to affect performance.

278
00:14:17,543 --> 00:14:20,205
So we had to simplify things to what it is today,

279
00:14:20,245 --> 00:14:21,906
which is just enemies appearing on the screen

280
00:14:21,946 --> 00:14:23,247
after you kill them.

281
00:14:30,569 --> 00:14:32,731
So this is pretty much the retail version you see now,

282
00:14:33,031 --> 00:14:35,313
with a bit of older art, and as I mentioned earlier,

283
00:14:35,433 --> 00:14:36,534
a lot of the features missing.

284
00:14:37,155 --> 00:14:39,257
Even though things like Charon, traits,

285
00:14:39,517 --> 00:14:41,079
and even the lineage system weren't in,

286
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:43,321
we were fairly confident that we would

287
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,842
be able to complete the game on time.

288
00:14:45,483 --> 00:14:47,705
Honestly, a video of the final version

289
00:14:47,765 --> 00:14:50,127
probably would have made more sense for this slide,

290
00:14:50,668 --> 00:14:52,049
but we thought this would be more interesting

291
00:14:52,089 --> 00:14:53,671
because you can just see the final game

292
00:14:53,731 --> 00:14:54,712
on like YouTube or something.

293
00:15:00,279 --> 00:15:02,521
We've been pretty strict with the budget to every game we've made.

294
00:15:03,182 --> 00:15:04,483
Rogue Legacy is no different,

295
00:15:04,563 --> 00:15:06,845
but we did come into it with a fair bit more experience.

296
00:15:07,526 --> 00:15:10,629
Here are a few key budget tips that we try to use on every game that we make.

297
00:15:13,491 --> 00:15:13,932
Autonomy.

298
00:15:14,612 --> 00:15:16,194
Work with people who can be independent.

299
00:15:16,834 --> 00:15:18,676
This is important for a small indie team

300
00:15:18,716 --> 00:15:20,337
because everyone wears multiple hats,

301
00:15:20,518 --> 00:15:23,300
and it's tough to micromanage people and fix their mistakes.

302
00:15:23,781 --> 00:15:25,222
You gotta be able to do that on your own.

303
00:15:27,087 --> 00:15:30,231
This has implications though, that not every developer would agree with.

304
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:33,796
This means our development process is not very democratic.

305
00:15:35,078 --> 00:15:39,504
Opinions matter, but when it comes down to it, the most trust is placed on the experts,

306
00:15:39,945 --> 00:15:41,186
and nothing is decided by vote.

307
00:15:45,477 --> 00:15:48,218
A good example of this happened with our character artist,

308
00:15:48,258 --> 00:15:48,898
Glabr Kotaki.

309
00:15:49,478 --> 00:15:51,259
We originally had a separate character

310
00:15:51,319 --> 00:15:53,520
and background artist, and I was stuck in the middle

311
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:55,620
trying to get their styles to work together.

312
00:15:56,421 --> 00:15:58,282
You can see from this picture how much the background

313
00:15:58,322 --> 00:16:00,402
and foreground clashed with the character art.

314
00:16:00,963 --> 00:16:03,263
Things were clearly not working, and thankfully,

315
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:05,564
Glabr decided to step up and fix things for us.

316
00:16:08,986 --> 00:16:11,207
So that was, the previous slide was what we had before,

317
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:12,447
and this is the final product.

318
00:16:13,256 --> 00:16:16,698
What's amazing is that Glauber had very limited experience on backgrounds before.

319
00:16:17,038 --> 00:16:19,920
He'd worked on them, but he'd never worked on something of this scale.

320
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:24,302
Budget-wise, it's crucial to work with these kinds of autonomous people.

321
00:16:24,922 --> 00:16:28,404
For Rogue Legacy, we didn't catch on fast enough, and it cost us dearly.

322
00:16:29,124 --> 00:16:33,006
Before Glauber fixed things, 20% of the entire project's costs

323
00:16:33,327 --> 00:16:36,048
were spent on this problem, and we didn't even get it resolved.

324
00:16:37,089 --> 00:16:38,910
We went through many, many different artists.

325
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:46,328
The second rule we follow is to make custom editor for each game.

326
00:16:46,728 --> 00:16:49,391
So try to make the editor for the game, not the company.

327
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:53,095
This isn't for everyone, but for us and the size of our projects,

328
00:16:53,435 --> 00:16:55,157
it always turns out cheaper and faster.

329
00:16:58,782 --> 00:17:01,144
So this is a picture of the editor that we used

330
00:17:01,164 --> 00:17:02,725
to make the rooms in Rogue Legacy.

331
00:17:03,565 --> 00:17:05,867
It seems intimidating, but it's actually quite simple.

332
00:17:06,588 --> 00:17:09,370
The map editor can only do one thing, make rooms.

333
00:17:10,031 --> 00:17:12,933
Because it's so rigid, it only took us two weeks to make.

334
00:17:13,714 --> 00:17:15,095
There were tweaks that came afterward,

335
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:17,136
but the bulk of the work was within that time frame.

336
00:17:18,357 --> 00:17:19,298
What's really great, though,

337
00:17:19,318 --> 00:17:20,980
is that we could create and bug test a room

338
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,461
in as little as five minutes.

339
00:17:23,635 --> 00:17:25,277
There won't be much that we can salvage for this

340
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,899
for our next projects, but that's fine

341
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,382
because the time that we saved creating contents

342
00:17:30,682 --> 00:17:33,145
more than makes up for the time spent on the code.

343
00:17:33,165 --> 00:17:36,768
Okay, sorry.

344
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,533
Our last point is to always have design alternatives.

345
00:17:42,053 --> 00:17:43,254
This ties in with what we mentioned

346
00:17:43,294 --> 00:17:44,175
at the beginning of the talk,

347
00:17:44,195 --> 00:17:45,657
where we always look out for cheap,

348
00:17:46,017 --> 00:17:47,538
fast, and reusable solutions.

349
00:17:48,451 --> 00:17:50,832
it's usually necessary to come up with multiple ideas

350
00:17:50,872 --> 00:17:53,474
to find the one that best suits the resources you have.

351
00:17:56,676 --> 00:17:58,637
When everything is categorized based off cost,

352
00:17:58,917 --> 00:18:01,378
it's a lot easier to gauge how far you can go with an idea.

353
00:18:02,181 --> 00:18:04,102
For example, the original lineage screen

354
00:18:04,143 --> 00:18:06,725
was going to show your entire ancestral family tree.

355
00:18:07,165 --> 00:18:09,126
So you could track spouses, children,

356
00:18:09,327 --> 00:18:11,068
follow branch offshoots, and so on.

357
00:18:11,588 --> 00:18:14,110
It was really expensive, and we ditched it early

358
00:18:14,210 --> 00:18:15,752
for the lineage line that only shows

359
00:18:15,772 --> 00:18:16,672
your preferred children.

360
00:18:17,333 --> 00:18:18,794
And we lost some of the ornamental features

361
00:18:18,834 --> 00:18:21,436
with this change, but the idea of an expanding legacy

362
00:18:21,476 --> 00:18:23,257
was retained, and we were able to do it

363
00:18:23,317 --> 00:18:24,318
for a fraction of the cost.

364
00:18:29,265 --> 00:18:34,048
So another quick example of design alternatives is the skill tree economy system.

365
00:18:34,869 --> 00:18:39,531
The choice we made for this was very contentious and illustrates how budget can play a big role in the decisions we make.

366
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:43,473
In this case, we actually chose a bad solution because it was so much cheaper.

367
00:18:44,314 --> 00:18:47,556
So the original skill tree economy is fairly straightforward.

368
00:18:47,916 --> 00:18:51,578
Every time you spend money to upgrade a skill, that particular skill price would raise.

369
00:18:52,299 --> 00:18:54,240
It seems simple, but there's a hidden problem to it.

370
00:18:57,802 --> 00:19:01,545
There's no way to save money in the game, because Charon's always taking it at the beginning of every run.

371
00:19:02,125 --> 00:19:05,488
So optimal skill builds always meant putting an equal number of points into each skill.

372
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:10,852
So you'd put like 10 points into health, and then it'd get too expensive, and you'd start putting 10 points into damage and so forth.

373
00:19:11,333 --> 00:19:13,094
In other words, there'd be no skill diversity.

374
00:19:13,895 --> 00:19:18,198
We wanted to encourage players to personalize their builds, which meant there had to be consequences to player choice.

375
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:22,582
But harsh consequences were counterintuitive to the casual scene we were going for,

376
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:24,783
so the repercussions had to be very light.

377
00:19:28,376 --> 00:19:31,017
So in the end, we decided to use a universal modifier.

378
00:19:31,617 --> 00:19:34,837
Buying a skill increases the cost of all other skills

379
00:19:34,877 --> 00:19:37,318
by a very small amount, as well as the skill you purchase

380
00:19:37,358 --> 00:19:38,078
by a large amount.

381
00:19:40,859 --> 00:19:42,619
What this did is it deterred players

382
00:19:42,659 --> 00:19:44,440
from evenly leveling up their characters

383
00:19:44,460 --> 00:19:47,020
throughout the game, resulting in more unique skill builds.

384
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:48,220
This is just one example.

385
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:51,681
Even though the solution worked,

386
00:19:51,901 --> 00:19:53,482
it was terrible for a lot of reasons.

387
00:19:55,402 --> 00:19:58,465
First, it feels bad having everything go up in price.

388
00:19:58,525 --> 00:20:00,767
When you purchase something and ancillary items

389
00:20:00,827 --> 00:20:03,369
get more expensive, it's not a good thing to do.

390
00:20:04,209 --> 00:20:06,611
And secondly, it punishes casual players

391
00:20:06,651 --> 00:20:08,753
who blindly upgrade their skills

392
00:20:08,893 --> 00:20:11,275
because they'll start reaching that point

393
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:13,997
where things become really expensive really quickly

394
00:20:14,157 --> 00:20:15,999
and they don't have an optimized character for it.

395
00:20:16,719 --> 00:20:19,621
And thirdly, and probably the biggest problem,

396
00:20:20,002 --> 00:20:22,784
was the negative effects of the fix aren't noticeable.

397
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:28,525
people would see the solution that we did, but they wouldn't know why we were doing it.

398
00:20:28,845 --> 00:20:33,111
So they'd go on to forums or they'd go on to send us emails asking us just to remove it.

399
00:20:33,491 --> 00:20:38,157
And it's such an obtuse problem that explaining it isn't very easy.

400
00:20:41,783 --> 00:20:43,945
But on the other hand, the pros were too much to pass up.

401
00:20:44,365 --> 00:20:46,587
So this is what we like to call a zero dollar solution.

402
00:20:47,308 --> 00:20:48,969
There was no art or audio that was needed,

403
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:51,591
and implementing it took literally less than 10 minutes.

404
00:20:52,092 --> 00:20:53,613
And because it's so self-contained,

405
00:20:54,934 --> 00:20:56,476
almost no time was spent balancing,

406
00:20:56,956 --> 00:20:58,737
and there was no QA required either.

407
00:20:59,258 --> 00:21:01,320
So our game is full of these kind of workarounds.

408
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:02,541
Some are better than others,

409
00:21:02,821 --> 00:21:04,242
but they're a big reason why Rogue Legacy

410
00:21:04,262 --> 00:21:05,203
had such a small budget.

411
00:21:05,783 --> 00:21:08,345
This example sort of encompasses our design mantra

412
00:21:08,466 --> 00:21:09,566
of good, not perfect.

413
00:21:13,384 --> 00:21:14,705
So, where do we go from here?

414
00:21:15,205 --> 00:21:19,188
We're now financially stable, and a lot of these budget workarounds might not be necessary

415
00:21:19,228 --> 00:21:19,568
anymore.

416
00:21:20,249 --> 00:21:22,450
So, the question is, would we still do things this way?

417
00:21:23,191 --> 00:21:24,992
And the answer is that we most likely will.

418
00:21:25,573 --> 00:21:27,054
There's more to it than just saving money.

419
00:21:27,514 --> 00:21:32,237
Finding simple solutions to big problems is useful in any scenario, and we often surprise

420
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,578
ourselves with the things we come up with.

421
00:21:34,079 --> 00:21:37,721
For us, it's also the most entertaining part of development, because that's when it's the

422
00:21:37,761 --> 00:21:38,342
most challenging.

423
00:21:41,344 --> 00:21:42,327
Anyways, that's it.

424
00:21:42,889 --> 00:21:44,574
Thanks to everyone for attending this talk

425
00:21:44,614 --> 00:21:45,918
and we hope it was insightful.

426
00:21:45,938 --> 00:21:48,566
Thank you.

427
00:21:48,586 --> 00:21:49,067
Okay, I'll say the rest.
