1
00:00:08,139 --> 00:00:11,418
And today I'm going to speak about urban planning in games.

2
00:00:13,264 --> 00:00:15,685
But before, a few words about myself.

3
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:23,108
It's two years that I've been working at City Project Red and 10 years that I'm in game dev in general.

4
00:00:23,768 --> 00:00:25,249
Worked mostly on environments.

5
00:00:26,229 --> 00:00:32,772
Also, I have a master's degree in urban planning, although I never work as architect or urban planner.

6
00:00:33,592 --> 00:00:39,674
However, I keep studying urban planning because it's my biggest hobby and I'm really into this topic.

7
00:00:41,135 --> 00:00:41,335
So,

8
00:00:42,852 --> 00:00:44,093
Why do we need urban planning?

9
00:00:44,773 --> 00:00:48,575
First of all, because urban setting is very common for many games.

10
00:00:49,015 --> 00:00:55,638
It can be a real city or a fictional one, like sci-fi, fantasy, futuristic, whatever.

11
00:00:56,498 --> 00:01:00,320
Still, it's an urban environment, and we have to know how to work with it.

12
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,263
What's more, urban setting is common not only for big open world projects,

13
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:11,562
but also for smaller games with maybe linear gameplay.

14
00:01:12,743 --> 00:01:29,995
Still, if we have to create, let's say, just one or a few streets instead of an entire city, we still have to understand what is the street and what kind of elements make your street actually recognized as a street.

15
00:01:30,536 --> 00:01:31,816
And it's not a trivial question.

16
00:01:33,318 --> 00:01:41,447
When we create an urban environment for games, we don't necessarily have to make it realistic.

17
00:01:42,068 --> 00:01:44,030
The goal is to make it believable.

18
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:50,297
I really like to compare urban planning for games with anatomy for game characters.

19
00:01:51,240 --> 00:02:06,246
Because when we're creating a character, well, not we, but character artists, they not necessarily follow real human proportions, but they still have to understand human anatomy, you know, to follow certain rules.

20
00:02:06,686 --> 00:02:15,450
And then, like, sometimes they simplify some things, sometimes they exaggerate, maybe add some additional parts, like, I don't know, horns, wings, whatever.

21
00:02:16,250 --> 00:02:17,530
So the same works with the city.

22
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:23,332
We have to understand urban environment and then adjust it to our specific needs.

23
00:02:24,372 --> 00:02:39,137
And of course, we cannot just simply copy-paste a real city from Google Maps, even in cases when we're actually creating a real existing city, because real proportions for cities will not work for our needs.

24
00:02:40,057 --> 00:02:40,718
Simple example.

25
00:02:41,798 --> 00:02:49,404
If we have a grocery store, let's say, 15 minutes away walk from our home, we would consider it as super close and super convenient.

26
00:02:49,444 --> 00:02:53,127
And of course, it would be nice to have this short walk to this grocery store.

27
00:02:53,547 --> 00:03:01,033
But in game, if we have to go for 15 minutes just walking, we would consider this as super boring.

28
00:03:01,919 --> 00:03:02,840
So yeah, it will not work.

29
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:12,313
Yeah, and we have to remember that real cities were made for comfortable living, and game cities should be made for fun playing.

30
00:03:12,433 --> 00:03:13,935
And those are completely different tasks.

31
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:28,643
And I will start with how not to do, because it's a very common mistake for many artists and designers, is that they perceive a city as a bunch of buildings randomly scattered on the surface.

32
00:03:29,343 --> 00:03:32,564
And at first glance, it might seem like that, but of course it is not.

33
00:03:33,304 --> 00:03:37,025
And I will show my idea on this really simple scheme.

34
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:45,526
And if you look at this, you may notice that actually those two silhouettes, CT1 and CT2, they're almost identical.

35
00:03:45,586 --> 00:03:48,328
It's really hard to see any difference there.

36
00:03:48,749 --> 00:03:55,314
But one of those is actually a city, and another one is a bunch of randomly scattered buildings.

37
00:03:55,434 --> 00:03:58,716
And in a second, actually right now, you'll understand what I mean.

38
00:03:59,577 --> 00:04:01,219
So, I guess now you get my idea.

39
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:05,003
The first one, the City 1, is actually a city.

40
00:04:05,764 --> 00:04:12,771
I mean, of course, it's a very simplified one, but we immediately read the structure, because we saw it many times.

41
00:04:14,312 --> 00:04:18,517
And when it comes to City 2, the second example, it's chaos.

42
00:04:19,117 --> 00:04:26,223
And, I mean, of course we can probably make a nice composition out of the cubes, but we still lack a structure.

43
00:04:26,483 --> 00:04:28,144
And a city, it's always a structure.

44
00:04:28,724 --> 00:04:29,585
But let's see...

45
00:04:31,016 --> 00:04:35,119
Let's have a look at those two examples from the street view.

46
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:45,668
So this is how we perceive cities as us, as a person, and as a player in first and third person view games.

47
00:04:46,568 --> 00:04:53,714
So if we look at the first example, the city one, again, obviously, we have lack of details.

48
00:04:54,234 --> 00:04:58,338
But even now, we more or less understand that this is a street with buildings.

49
00:04:59,695 --> 00:05:01,017
And I would like to highlight it.

50
00:05:01,477 --> 00:05:07,903
We have zero information about this city, but we understand a lot about the space.

51
00:05:08,603 --> 00:05:13,127
And I say a lot because I literally put 10 cubes and you already see a street.

52
00:05:14,165 --> 00:05:19,289
And when it comes to second example, it's really hard to say, what's that?

53
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:25,833
Like, it's definitely not a street because street supposed to have certain direction and there is none.

54
00:05:26,774 --> 00:05:31,177
Maybe it's something like a backyard, but I would say it's too complicated for backyard.

55
00:05:31,237 --> 00:05:35,160
And it's really hard to imagine the shape of city block that would create this backyard.

56
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:38,683
So long story short, it's really hard to recognize the space.

57
00:05:38,723 --> 00:05:39,924
It's really hard to say, what's that?

58
00:05:40,710 --> 00:05:41,571
And here is the main idea.

59
00:05:42,292 --> 00:05:45,537
We probably can imitate the city without using urban planning.

60
00:05:45,617 --> 00:05:51,785
I mean, you know, if we put all those cubes in nice composition, like, you know, level design also could be quite playable.

61
00:05:54,642 --> 00:06:01,988
If we use urban planning from the very beginning, if we perceive a city as a structure, we would just, you know, simplify our lives.

62
00:06:02,088 --> 00:06:10,594
Because, as you can see, if we use urban planning, we can create a distinctive and recognizable space from the very first step of production.

63
00:06:13,196 --> 00:06:18,980
So, to understand how to make a city, first we should know what the city is made of.

64
00:06:21,153 --> 00:06:28,557
But before, short disclaimer, I have to say that there are generally two types of urban planning.

65
00:06:29,498 --> 00:06:33,740
It's a city block type and a super block type of urban planning.

66
00:06:34,321 --> 00:06:37,703
So city block is a dense row of buildings along the street.

67
00:06:38,023 --> 00:06:43,126
We can meet this type everywhere around the world, like in Europe, America.

68
00:06:43,386 --> 00:06:46,768
Basically, I guess it's any city that was built before 20th century.

69
00:06:46,808 --> 00:06:49,690
San Francisco is a great example of such urban planning.

70
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:59,134
And superblock type, it's separately standing buildings, usually around some infrastructure unit and surrounded by big roads.

71
00:06:59,274 --> 00:07:01,976
And also there can be a lot of like trees and stuff like that.

72
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:10,380
So this type of urban planning was invented by modernist or brutalist architects in the first part of 20th century.

73
00:07:10,460 --> 00:07:12,561
And it was really popular after Second War.

74
00:07:12,941 --> 00:07:18,004
And also we can meet this type of urban planning everywhere around the world, like Europe, America, Asia,

75
00:07:18,464 --> 00:07:19,705
Africa, I believe, everywhere.

76
00:07:20,205 --> 00:07:35,877
But in my talk, I will focus only on city block type of urban planning because, well, because I like it, because I believe that it's much better for human perception, although we can discuss it because, you know, it's my topic, so if you have other thoughts, just, you know, reach me out.

77
00:07:36,838 --> 00:07:46,745
But still, what will be said in this talk can be easily extrapolated to superblock type of urban planning if this is something that you are interested in.

78
00:07:48,605 --> 00:07:50,387
Yeah, so now let's go to the main part.

79
00:07:51,609 --> 00:07:54,232
There are three basic types of city space.

80
00:07:54,773 --> 00:07:57,557
It's street, square and backyard.

81
00:07:58,852 --> 00:08:07,539
In real cities, there can be more types, but those three take the biggest surface and are present in every city.

82
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:14,945
There are other examples of city space, like, for example, parks or any type of green areas.

83
00:08:15,965 --> 00:08:21,650
Also markets, maybe parkings, construction sites, you know, the list is endless, you name it.

84
00:08:23,591 --> 00:08:35,139
And those different types of city space can be present in your in-game city optionally, but those three will be there for sure.

85
00:08:35,639 --> 00:08:43,244
So just to rephrase, these three types are the core of the city, but not the ultimate list of city space.

86
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:46,871
And here is an example from real life.

87
00:08:48,292 --> 00:08:52,716
I mean, I don't think that I should comment a lot about this.

88
00:08:52,776 --> 00:08:53,997
So I guess you understand.

89
00:08:54,057 --> 00:08:54,718
So street.

90
00:08:55,058 --> 00:08:59,642
And of course, shape of those space can be different.

91
00:08:59,682 --> 00:09:01,664
Because for example, here we have straight street.

92
00:09:01,684 --> 00:09:03,025
But of course, street can be also like

93
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:03,385
course

94
00:09:20,250 --> 00:09:20,610
But still.

95
00:09:21,551 --> 00:09:23,132
And here's the main idea.

96
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:35,618
If we imagine that we were teleported into a random city that we have never been before, so we have no idea where we are, we would immediately recognize the space around us.

97
00:09:36,398 --> 00:09:40,039
So if we are in the street, we would understand that, OK, it's a street.

98
00:09:40,659 --> 00:09:45,760
If we are in the middle of the square, it also would be absolutely clear for us that, yeah, it's a square.

99
00:09:46,040 --> 00:09:47,081
The same goes for backyard.

100
00:09:47,141 --> 00:09:55,262
And there is no chance that we would confuse, I don't know, backyard with the street or square with street or backyard, whatever.

101
00:09:55,322 --> 00:09:58,603
So it's quite clear for us.

102
00:09:59,203 --> 00:10:01,824
And I believe that in games, it should work the same.

103
00:10:02,284 --> 00:10:05,945
So if the player was spawned randomly somewhere in our city,

104
00:10:06,826 --> 00:10:09,448
they should immediately understand where they are.

105
00:10:10,489 --> 00:10:10,909
Just like that.

106
00:10:13,271 --> 00:10:15,353
And here is examples from Night City.

107
00:10:15,653 --> 00:10:19,617
So this is a street and again, not much to add here.

108
00:10:19,677 --> 00:10:27,424
It's quite clear because we have direction, we have road, we have sidewalks, we have buildings on the left and right.

109
00:10:27,484 --> 00:10:28,365
So this is a street.

110
00:10:29,843 --> 00:10:33,744
This is example of square, pretty much the main one, Corpo Plaza.

111
00:10:33,964 --> 00:10:38,806
And again, it's quite readable as a square, like we have no doubts what's that.

112
00:10:40,826 --> 00:10:41,526
And the backyard.

113
00:10:41,927 --> 00:10:47,228
And also, as you can see, well, I believe that it's really hard to confuse these three types of space.

114
00:10:47,308 --> 00:10:48,628
They are very distinctive.

115
00:10:48,708 --> 00:10:53,650
And I guess you would never confuse this backyard with the square, right?

116
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:07,330
So now, when we know the main components of city, once again, it's streets, squares, and backyards, let's discuss how to actually make a city.

117
00:11:09,192 --> 00:11:11,393
And there are three basic parameters of the city.

118
00:11:12,314 --> 00:11:14,215
It's size, proportions,

119
00:11:15,378 --> 00:11:16,138
and level of detail.

120
00:11:17,099 --> 00:11:22,302
And I won't surprise you if I say that these three parameters are very much connected with gameplay.

121
00:11:22,642 --> 00:11:26,185
Obviously, because we're creating a city for game and not just abstract city.

122
00:11:27,125 --> 00:11:33,829
And to be more precise, these parameters are connected with type of movement and particularly with speed of movement.

123
00:11:34,169 --> 00:11:37,632
And now I will talk about this in more detail.

124
00:11:38,132 --> 00:11:39,353
So first one is size.

125
00:11:40,473 --> 00:11:47,535
Size is the simplest parameter, so it's literally square meters, or square kilometers, or square feet, I guess.

126
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:49,335
Like, it's popular here, right?

127
00:11:52,236 --> 00:11:52,616
So yeah.

128
00:11:53,776 --> 00:11:59,978
Also, at this stage, we should think about borders of our city and the shape of the city.

129
00:12:00,258 --> 00:12:09,400
Because maybe our city is located on a shoreline, or maybe it's surrounded by mountains, maybe it's in a valley, maybe it's, I don't know, like a peninsula,

130
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:10,840
something like that.

131
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:13,222
So at this stage we should kind of think about it.

132
00:12:14,942 --> 00:12:31,410
And of course it is connected on gameplay and like I said speed of movement because if in our city we're mostly driving a car, which means that our speed is quite big, so apparently we would need bigger city than if we're creating a city for mostly walking.

133
00:12:32,911 --> 00:12:47,632
Example if we make in a city, let's say I don't know one kilometer by one kilometer this like area probably not entire city for driving it would be super small because it would take us like how much like five seconds to reach from one side to another and

134
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:55,682
And if we're walking, area one kilometer by one kilometer, it's quite OK for walking.

135
00:12:55,702 --> 00:12:58,702
And we can spend quite a lot of time exploring this area.

136
00:12:58,802 --> 00:12:59,763
So this is about size.

137
00:13:00,143 --> 00:13:02,483
And of course, this parameter would change during production.

138
00:13:03,343 --> 00:13:08,265
But it's really important to come up with basic numbers.

139
00:13:08,605 --> 00:13:15,186
So we just need to understand whether we're creating 5 by 5 kilometer or 50 by 50, so on this scale.

140
00:13:15,346 --> 00:13:18,127
It's not something that you're setting stone right away.

141
00:13:19,769 --> 00:13:21,310
The next parameter is proportions.

142
00:13:21,891 --> 00:13:27,217
And this is about lengths and widths of streets, sizes of city blocks, also size of streets.

143
00:13:27,518 --> 00:13:28,179
Yeah, I said it.

144
00:13:28,779 --> 00:13:33,184
And all the stuff which is like, you know, inside the city.

145
00:13:33,955 --> 00:13:47,755
And it also depends on type of movement, because again, if we move fast, then apparently we would need longer streets, because it would be uncomfortable if we have to make a turn each, like, I don't know, five seconds.

146
00:13:51,078 --> 00:13:58,784
If we're mostly walking, then we can make it, like, proportions could be smaller, and it would be still comfortable.

147
00:13:59,424 --> 00:14:04,308
And proportions most likely will be different in different parts of the city.

148
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:08,651
But again, at this stage, we're coming up with some global idea.

149
00:14:10,553 --> 00:14:29,906
We just need to understand whether we're creating something big, like a huge city with mega buildings, skyscrapers, broad avenues, and that kind of stuff, or we're creating small, medieval town with narrow, curved streets and tiny gingerbread houses.

150
00:14:30,326 --> 00:14:33,228
So again, on this scale, we should decide it at this stage.

151
00:14:34,986 --> 00:14:36,107
And finally, level of detail.

152
00:14:36,787 --> 00:14:38,649
Also, it depends on gameplay.

153
00:14:39,569 --> 00:14:47,815
Because if our game is about slow movement and exploration, most likely we should put more details, and they should look kind of unique.

154
00:14:49,616 --> 00:14:58,642
And if we move fast, then there is no need in smallest details, and we should focus more on medium and big shapes.

155
00:14:59,243 --> 00:15:01,824
And in Night City, we actually have different examples.

156
00:15:01,884 --> 00:15:03,406
Because, for example, on Top Shot,

157
00:15:04,606 --> 00:15:13,952
We have this area where we only driving because it's hard to imagine why would player just go out and walk there because there is nothing to do, nothing to explore.

158
00:15:14,793 --> 00:15:20,997
So here it was important to focus more on bigger shapes to create like nice composition, player guidance, et cetera.

159
00:15:22,038 --> 00:15:24,600
And bottom image, it's from Dogtown.

160
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:26,521
And in Dogtown, we actually walk a lot.

161
00:15:26,761 --> 00:15:29,363
We still can drive there, but we're also walking.

162
00:15:30,468 --> 00:15:41,472
And that's why it was reasonable to create more details, you know, to make this area interesting for exploration.

163
00:15:41,872 --> 00:15:47,154
So I'm just trying to say that it doesn't work like as more detail you have as better.

164
00:15:47,294 --> 00:15:49,035
No, the amount of detail should be reasonable.

165
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:54,597
And to summarize this part, I would just say that

166
00:15:56,890 --> 00:16:04,737
The main thing that affects these three parameters, once again, size, proportions, and level of detail, it's gameplay and particular speed of movement.

167
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:11,863
If we move mostly by car, we should have long enough streets and quite big city, and maybe not huge amount of details.

168
00:16:12,724 --> 00:16:20,451
And if we move on foot, the city might be smaller and, let's say, more compact, and with bigger amount of details.

169
00:16:23,110 --> 00:16:35,600
So after we decided how big our city should be, what proportions we need there, and amount of details we're aiming for, we should think about visual diversity of the city.

170
00:16:36,681 --> 00:16:38,703
Because every city doesn't look evenly the same.

171
00:16:39,443 --> 00:16:42,626
There are always different parts which look different.

172
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,170
The best example, usually we have city center, which look

173
00:16:47,750 --> 00:16:54,255
often fancy, or not necessary actually, and outskirts, suburbs, which look differently.

174
00:16:55,016 --> 00:16:59,199
And speaking of these areas, I usually use the term neighborhoods.

175
00:17:00,260 --> 00:17:09,108
And by neighborhood, I mean city area that shares the same appearance, atmosphere, and other features, which I will talk about, of course.

176
00:17:09,708 --> 00:17:15,073
And Night City is actually a good example, of course, because we have a lot of different neighborhoods there.

177
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:21,300
And if you played, I guess you would never confuse, for example, Kabuki and Charter Hill.

178
00:17:21,380 --> 00:17:22,481
They look completely different.

179
00:17:24,323 --> 00:17:32,191
So to create this visual difference, we have three foundations how it is built.

180
00:17:33,186 --> 00:17:36,549
First, it's layout, architecture, and landmarks.

181
00:17:36,910 --> 00:17:40,553
And now I will talk about all of these three things.

182
00:17:43,977 --> 00:17:44,858
So first one is layout.

183
00:17:45,839 --> 00:17:52,746
And yeah, to create a diverse environment, we should start with a different layout for each neighborhood.

184
00:17:54,099 --> 00:17:56,101
First of all, let's think about proportions.

185
00:17:56,441 --> 00:18:01,027
Yes, we already spoke about proportions for entire city, but like I said, it was like bigger scale.

186
00:18:01,107 --> 00:18:03,529
And now let's focus on proportions for each neighborhood.

187
00:18:05,709 --> 00:18:11,294
And like, because yeah, like I said, cities never built evenly the same, right?

188
00:18:11,514 --> 00:18:20,922
And we still can have, we still can have neighborhoods with broader, broad streets, skyscrapers, et cetera.

189
00:18:21,182 --> 00:18:27,368
And of course we can have areas with smaller streets, smaller buildings, maybe even slums.

190
00:18:28,068 --> 00:18:29,369
And example from,

191
00:18:30,330 --> 00:18:40,654
from Night City, so on top shot we have Rancho Coronado, which has this, you know, small one-story buildings, and city center with this huge mega buildings.

192
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:55,939
And when it comes to planning features, so again, looking at this slide, we can immediately see that on top shot in Rancho Coronado, it's like flat, quite spacious environment.

193
00:18:57,043 --> 00:19:02,727
And bottom image, we can see that it's very, I don't know, packed with everything.

194
00:19:02,847 --> 00:19:07,130
It's multi-layered because we have different levels of streets and sidewalks.

195
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:08,832
So this is about planning features.

196
00:19:09,352 --> 00:19:14,636
And about patterns, let's have a look on next slides.

197
00:19:15,502 --> 00:19:19,165
So I just create this really fast schemes.

198
00:19:19,706 --> 00:19:26,051
And again, I going back to this part when I created distinctive and readable environments using just cubes.

199
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:37,261
So when I was creating this, I was thinking about, you know, average European city with like middle size, I would say everything like streets, buildings.

200
00:19:37,702 --> 00:19:41,085
And this is how player feel inside the space.

201
00:19:42,975 --> 00:19:47,096
And here we have a pretty much similar pattern, but different size.

202
00:19:48,056 --> 00:19:55,638
And impression that we have here is, well, I guess quite different because all space is much smaller.

203
00:19:55,758 --> 00:19:58,679
And once again, so this is how we feel there.

204
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,581
And in a smaller area.

205
00:20:07,632 --> 00:20:09,914
And the third example, which looks completely different.

206
00:20:09,974 --> 00:20:15,839
So here we have different size, different pattern and feeling that we have when we walk there.

207
00:20:15,939 --> 00:20:17,781
It's also like completely different.

208
00:20:18,141 --> 00:20:22,585
So this is something like, I don't know, maybe like townhouses or something like that.

209
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:26,028
I think quite common pattern for America.

210
00:20:29,381 --> 00:20:32,162
So that was about layout, and now architecture.

211
00:20:33,403 --> 00:20:41,106
So we should define architectural features for each neighborhood, and we can start with architectural styles, because, I don't know, I guess it's the simplest.

212
00:20:41,926 --> 00:20:47,448
In Night City, we have four main styles, and not only for architectural, but pretty much for everything.

213
00:20:47,568 --> 00:20:51,010
It's militarism, kitsch, neo-kitsch, and entropism.

214
00:20:51,830 --> 00:21:01,871
And here on the slide, you can see city center, which was built in this militarism style, and bottom image, which is built in entropism.

215
00:21:04,582 --> 00:21:05,842
The next one is colors.

216
00:21:06,382 --> 00:21:10,103
So each neighborhood can have its own color coding.

217
00:21:11,164 --> 00:21:17,085
And this top example is from Japantown, and it's very colorful, very kitschy.

218
00:21:17,805 --> 00:21:25,087
And the bottom image, it's more like business district, so it's gray, like colors are quite calm.

219
00:21:25,907 --> 00:21:27,928
And it creates this visual difference, of course.

220
00:21:29,748 --> 00:21:30,610
The next one is hate.

221
00:21:30,930 --> 00:21:38,444
So we can have neighborhoods with high-rise buildings and some one, two, three-story buildings.

222
00:21:41,606 --> 00:21:42,226
Also age.

223
00:21:42,666 --> 00:21:51,848
In Night City, of course, we don't have really ancient buildings, but still there is a difference in age because we can have something older.

224
00:21:52,568 --> 00:22:01,170
I don't know, I would say maybe like 90s, 2000s, and like really brand new futuristic buildings, yeah.

225
00:22:04,411 --> 00:22:05,191
Also richness.

226
00:22:05,871 --> 00:22:09,352
So again, we have rich districts and we have super poor districts.

227
00:22:12,116 --> 00:22:12,917
Also condition.

228
00:22:13,837 --> 00:22:24,884
We have districts which are in very good condition, like this Charter Hill on the top image, and something that is in very bad condition, like Dogtown.

229
00:22:24,964 --> 00:22:29,067
So this is like half destroyed, dirty, et cetera.

230
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,929
So this list actually can be endless.

231
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:48,301
Like, I just give a few examples, and it's not even all examples from Night City, but just something that, you know, just give an idea about that, because for your project, maybe some of those examples would be irrelevant, and maybe you would need to come up with something else.

232
00:22:49,181 --> 00:22:50,763
But again, it's just an example.

233
00:22:51,873 --> 00:22:53,595
And the third thing, it's landmarks.

234
00:22:53,895 --> 00:22:59,261
Because besides regular buildings, we should think about landmarks.

235
00:23:00,242 --> 00:23:03,366
And ideally for each neighborhood, of course, we should have its own landmark.

236
00:23:04,227 --> 00:23:07,771
And this landmark would become something like a symbol of this neighborhood.

237
00:23:08,652 --> 00:23:11,995
And landmarks should look unique in comparison to other buildings.

238
00:23:13,724 --> 00:23:18,167
But also, at the same time, they kind of should belong to this neighborhood.

239
00:23:18,508 --> 00:23:29,154
So when we are there and when we see this landmark, we should kind of understand why is it there, what is this function, and, you know, like, why it's there, basically.

240
00:23:30,015 --> 00:23:31,956
And of course, landmark should be visible.

241
00:23:33,157 --> 00:23:34,538
Otherwise, it makes no sense.

242
00:23:36,337 --> 00:23:41,526
And I would like to extend this topic about landmark a little bit more because it's a really important thing.

243
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:52,984
So besides local landmarks that I just mentioned for each neighborhood, we also should think about a main landmark for the city.

244
00:23:53,064 --> 00:23:55,865
It can be one landmark or several of them, depends.

245
00:23:56,766 --> 00:24:01,108
So it's something that would become a symbol of our city.

246
00:24:01,569 --> 00:24:08,353
And in real life, think about Eiffel Tower in Paris or Golden Gate in San Francisco.

247
00:24:08,593 --> 00:24:13,056
So basically something that you can see on a postcard or this fridge magnet.

248
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:19,028
And in Night City, we have this advertising race.

249
00:24:20,229 --> 00:24:25,254
They are big, they're very noticeable, and we can see them pretty much everywhere in the city.

250
00:24:28,597 --> 00:24:38,605
But also, when you're working on landmarks, it's very important to think about, to make them visually appealing, both from distance and from close up.

251
00:24:39,670 --> 00:24:45,296
And this is example, again, from Night City and about this advertising race.

252
00:24:45,836 --> 00:24:49,159
Because like I said, we see them and they are very appealing.

253
00:24:49,220 --> 00:24:53,043
And for example, this shot was taken really far away from this ray.

254
00:24:53,684 --> 00:24:55,225
And we want to go there.

255
00:24:55,245 --> 00:24:59,430
We want to see how does it look because it's really catchy.

256
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:04,769
But when we reach this place, we actually see that it has no bottom.

257
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,775
It's really even hard to understand that we already reached this place, that we're already there.

258
00:25:12,036 --> 00:25:19,723
Because this ray, it goes from the roof of the building, and there is nothing really distinctive in the bottom.

259
00:25:22,480 --> 00:25:25,243
The same works sometimes with some megabuildings.

260
00:25:26,063 --> 00:25:33,629
So those megabuildings, they work as local landmarks, and they also very visible from different points of view, and they are very eye-catching.

261
00:25:34,710 --> 00:25:40,775
But when we come closer, it's, again, sometimes really hard to understand that we're already there.

262
00:25:40,935 --> 00:25:47,300
And this shot was taken directly under this megabuilding.

263
00:25:47,380 --> 00:25:50,062
So really, there is no signs that we're already there.

264
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:52,998
But lesson was learned.

265
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:05,594
And when landmarks for Dogtown were created, they were created in the way that it's like appealing, visually appealing both from distance and from close up.

266
00:26:05,614 --> 00:26:10,580
So this example is this Black Sapphire Club, which is really visible from big distance.

267
00:26:11,843 --> 00:26:23,152
And when we come closer, there is no chance that we would miss it because it looks really unique and visually interesting from the close distance.

268
00:26:25,473 --> 00:26:26,554
The same goes for Stadium.

269
00:26:26,754 --> 00:26:31,378
It's also really noticeable from distance, especially when we are approaching Dogtown.

270
00:26:33,361 --> 00:26:38,802
And when we come closer, we can see it in all this beauty and glory.

271
00:26:40,143 --> 00:26:43,464
Because yeah, like from close up, it also works great.

272
00:26:46,784 --> 00:26:52,966
Okay, so we decided what is the size of our city and what is proportions.

273
00:26:53,366 --> 00:27:01,268
We also know how many neighborhoods we wanna have and what kind of features would share those neighborhoods.

274
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:05,263
And also, we have a list of landmarks for our city.

275
00:27:06,063 --> 00:27:09,004
So finally, it's time to actually make a city.

276
00:27:12,225 --> 00:27:18,307
And of course, like any other design of pretty much everything, we should start with references.

277
00:27:19,372 --> 00:27:27,315
It's much easier if you're creating a real existing city, because of course you can use a lot from real life maps and examples.

278
00:27:29,016 --> 00:27:40,761
And yeah, it's a bit harder if you're creating a fictional city, but still I would recommend to stick to existing layouts, existing examples from real cities.

279
00:27:42,101 --> 00:27:44,422
I made this fast exercise.

280
00:27:45,443 --> 00:27:53,787
So I took this place from Vienna, because, well, those shots are from Google Maps, but still, I was there in this place.

281
00:27:54,308 --> 00:27:59,450
And I felt that it's really nice, like this small square, this irregular shape.

282
00:28:00,231 --> 00:28:04,153
It was really comfortable to stay, to be there.

283
00:28:04,213 --> 00:28:05,394
Like, I like the composition.

284
00:28:05,774 --> 00:28:07,895
So I took this and used our

285
00:28:11,057 --> 00:28:12,397
our cyberpunk buildings.

286
00:28:12,918 --> 00:28:18,081
And as you can see, it's really hard to recognize Vienna or any European city on the shot.

287
00:28:18,461 --> 00:28:20,722
So it looks pretty much like cyberpunk.

288
00:28:22,323 --> 00:28:38,533
So my idea here is that you still can use existing layouts, like some parts of the city, even at first glance, even if they look irrelevant at first glance, like they still could work if composition is nice, and if you feel that it looks interesting.

289
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:51,987
Also, when you're creating a city, think about alternation of narrow and small spaces and some open areas.

290
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:56,230
Here at this example, I made a square.

291
00:28:56,470 --> 00:28:57,291
It's right now.

292
00:28:57,511 --> 00:29:05,497
So yeah, so the guy runs and then suddenly he come to some square and it makes this kind of difference.

293
00:29:06,625 --> 00:29:08,226
But also, it's not necessary it can be a square.

294
00:29:08,266 --> 00:29:11,309
Like, any type of open space.

295
00:29:11,349 --> 00:29:15,752
Like, it can be maybe, I don't know, destroyed building, I don't know, parking, river, whatever.

296
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:22,697
Also, in your city, there might be large streets.

297
00:29:23,057 --> 00:29:27,860
And when you're creating large streets, they should never end up with some dead ends.

298
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:32,924
And by dead ends, I also mean not only, like, literally dead end, but also, like, T intersection.

299
00:29:33,544 --> 00:29:34,165
It will not work.

300
00:29:36,127 --> 00:29:40,292
In real cities, usually bigger streets never just end up.

301
00:29:40,453 --> 00:29:44,859
They usually merge with other big streets and go just outside the city.

302
00:29:45,159 --> 00:29:50,466
But if you need to break the big street, just use a square.

303
00:29:50,827 --> 00:29:52,369
So you have a street.

304
00:29:52,809 --> 00:30:00,239
Then it ends up with a square and then it can be divided by smaller streets and those smaller streets already can be Interrupted by just dead ends.

305
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:03,743
And also I took this example from just random European cities.

306
00:30:03,783 --> 00:30:06,847
So sometimes it occurs in real world as well

307
00:30:09,873 --> 00:30:15,357
Speaking of larger streets, think about main street in your city.

308
00:30:15,977 --> 00:30:19,380
In smaller city, it can be maybe one or two main streets.

309
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,921
In bigger city, there can be more.

310
00:30:21,421 --> 00:30:29,226
So this is something like arterias in your cities, which connects different part of the city, different neighborhoods.

311
00:30:30,667 --> 00:30:45,871
And it's really good to have some, because it creates, like, well, first of all, it's something that would really simplify the navigation in your city, because once player reach the street, they would more or less understand where they are and where to go.

312
00:30:46,411 --> 00:30:53,393
Pretty much the same as in real world, because when you're in bigger street, usually you kind of feel comfortable if you have to find the way.

313
00:30:59,229 --> 00:31:00,330
One more thing about landmarks.

314
00:31:00,890 --> 00:31:14,960
So when you're drawing streets try to orient them towards landmarks Bigger street can go towards main and bigger landmarks smaller street can go towards smaller landmarks in in this in this case you would

315
00:31:16,361 --> 00:31:30,208
You would first create better navigation in your city because when you have landmarks, something unique, so it's something that you would remember, something that you would immediately recognize, and like I said, it's easy to navigate.

316
00:31:30,568 --> 00:31:35,711
And also, it would give more visibility for your landmarks.

317
00:31:40,985 --> 00:31:51,908
Also think about visual diversity of streets, because we already spoke about visual diversity of neighborhoods, but also different streets in one neighborhood also could be different.

318
00:31:52,889 --> 00:32:00,311
And this example is from, again, Night City, just random streets, two streets in city center.

319
00:32:00,851 --> 00:32:07,253
So the left one looks quite rich and fancy with all those neon lights and everything.

320
00:32:07,893 --> 00:32:15,720
And the right one looks quite gloomy and basically the place where you easily can be stumped.

321
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:29,211
But the thing is that they both are in the same neighborhood, they're built with more or less the same architecture, but they have completely different moods.

322
00:32:29,231 --> 00:32:30,652
And the same works with real cities.

323
00:32:31,032 --> 00:32:34,155
This example was taken from, again, Google Maps.

324
00:32:34,675 --> 00:32:35,396
It's Pittsburgh.

325
00:32:36,292 --> 00:32:44,058
And here you can see, on the left example, it's quite a big street, again, with different buildings.

326
00:32:45,259 --> 00:32:50,544
And the right example, it's there, it's behind the corner.

327
00:32:50,604 --> 00:32:54,947
So again, it's the same neighborhood, the same architecture, the same, I don't know, property value.

328
00:32:56,048 --> 00:32:59,072
atmosphere and vibes of those streets, they're completely different.

329
00:32:59,433 --> 00:33:00,114
And why is that so?

330
00:33:00,134 --> 00:33:01,876
Well, first of all, because of size.

331
00:33:02,317 --> 00:33:04,099
I mean, the width of the street.

332
00:33:04,159 --> 00:33:06,883
So, of course, when you have narrow, elevated, it feels different.

333
00:33:07,544 --> 00:33:10,809
And also function, because on this

334
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:15,112
Left street, we can see different buildings.

335
00:33:15,912 --> 00:33:19,194
I don't know exactly what's that, but I think it's something like a shop.

336
00:33:19,314 --> 00:33:21,775
This yellow building might be a bank or something like that.

337
00:33:22,075 --> 00:33:23,176
Also like office buildings.

338
00:33:24,057 --> 00:33:33,281
And this example on right shot, it's mostly residential areas and also just kind of back facades of buildings.

339
00:33:33,862 --> 00:33:39,825
And only this plus width of the street creates this difference.

340
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:44,579
Also remember about elevation.

341
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:51,130
Hills and descents can create very interesting composition and open unexpected vistas.

342
00:33:53,128 --> 00:33:58,613
And one more example from Night City, from Kabuki, basically.

343
00:33:59,333 --> 00:34:08,841
If we look on top of this neighborhood, we can see streets and city blocks, quite clear, quite simple, I would say.

344
00:34:09,181 --> 00:34:13,945
But this neighborhood was built on hills.

345
00:34:14,706 --> 00:34:15,827
And when we walk there,

346
00:34:17,348 --> 00:34:22,255
We have a lot of these nice openings to the entire city.

347
00:34:22,716 --> 00:34:26,020
Again, we can see this landmark from this area.

348
00:34:26,641 --> 00:34:30,426
And we have it because we have these hills and deserts.

349
00:34:30,867 --> 00:34:31,568
This is how it works.

350
00:34:34,423 --> 00:34:37,805
Also, be careful with completely straight streets.

351
00:34:38,685 --> 00:34:44,048
Besides that, a straight street often feels monotonous in terms of movement.

352
00:34:44,888 --> 00:34:51,371
But also, it might bring some problems in the future when it comes to optimization.

353
00:34:51,671 --> 00:34:58,455
Because if you look at this left example, you can see these super long streets with a lot of buildings.

354
00:34:59,155 --> 00:35:16,373
Of course, now it's only a cube, so it's not a lot of things there, but if we imagine that this is already final shot, final city, so we have all these buildings with some details, also we have probably street traffic, we have NPCs, so a lot of details.

355
00:35:17,094 --> 00:35:19,957
And it would be quite hard to optimize this.

356
00:35:21,230 --> 00:35:30,674
And if we look at right example, so I made this small angle and I cut the street like, I don't know, three or four times already.

357
00:35:31,094 --> 00:35:33,855
So we have much less details there.

358
00:35:36,328 --> 00:35:51,737
Well, I mean, of course, if we have to create a city with completely straight streets, for example, like most of American cities, they have straight streets, it would be trickier, but still it's possible to work with it.

359
00:35:51,897 --> 00:35:54,839
And again, another great example from Dogtown.

360
00:35:55,339 --> 00:36:00,202
So here we had this monument avenue that goes almost straight.

361
00:36:00,782 --> 00:36:04,985
And actually when you walk there or drive there, you feel it as a straight street.

362
00:36:05,545 --> 00:36:09,829
But it has this slight angle, like really almost not noticeable.

363
00:36:10,149 --> 00:36:14,873
But this angle already helped us to cut the view like almost twice.

364
00:36:15,554 --> 00:36:24,162
And yeah, when it was time to actually optimize this area, we were quite thankful for this small angle.

365
00:36:28,275 --> 00:36:35,161
And another one point about straight and curved street, and you might think that I am ambassador of curved streets, and yes, I am.

366
00:36:35,342 --> 00:36:36,402
I love curved streets.

367
00:36:37,063 --> 00:36:46,712
So on the left example, player moves very, like, monotonously, evenly, straight, like, you know, just along the straight line, and I would say it's boring.

368
00:36:47,012 --> 00:36:50,095
And again, for this type of movement, because apparently if,

369
00:36:51,316 --> 00:36:56,520
If player move by car or just, you know, 10 times faster, it would be okay to have the straight chunk.

370
00:36:56,860 --> 00:37:03,045
But particularly for this speed of movement, it feels really boring and, you know, very monotonous.

371
00:37:03,806 --> 00:37:08,409
And on the right example, player has to make a turn every

372
00:37:10,351 --> 00:37:12,452
every few seconds, I don't know.

373
00:37:12,932 --> 00:37:21,197
And it also creates this difference, because once we make a turn, we have a completely different view, and it also creates this kind of diversity.

374
00:37:24,259 --> 00:37:26,020
So, let's summarize.

375
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:31,803
So, a city is a structure and rules, and not just buildings randomly scattered on the surface.

376
00:37:33,544 --> 00:37:36,386
There are three basic types of urban space.

377
00:37:37,598 --> 00:37:40,480
It's street, square, and backyard.

378
00:37:42,222 --> 00:37:48,487
There are three basic parameters of the city, its size, proportions, and level of detail.

379
00:37:50,562 --> 00:37:52,903
And there are three foundations of visual diversity.

380
00:37:53,664 --> 00:37:56,345
It's layout, architecture, and landmarks.

381
00:37:57,126 --> 00:38:02,989
So urban planning for cities and games is the same as anatomy for characters.

382
00:38:03,529 --> 00:38:09,572
It's a base and powerful tool that helps to create great and high quality urban environments.

383
00:38:12,054 --> 00:38:12,574
Thank you.

384
00:38:24,167 --> 00:38:24,653
and also

385
00:38:25,958 --> 00:38:29,499
Yeah, so also I have this small advertising shot.

386
00:38:29,559 --> 00:38:34,220
So this is another talks from my awesome colleagues.

387
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:35,980
Please join them.

388
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:40,061
I mean, some of them already were yesterday, but still there are plenty of those.

389
00:38:41,941 --> 00:38:46,422
Yeah, and also I have this corporate shot, this one.

390
00:38:46,922 --> 00:38:50,503
So if you want to work with us, we have like new office in Boston.

391
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:52,843
So scan the code and yeah, we're hiring.

392
00:38:57,340 --> 00:38:57,721
Thank you.

393
00:38:59,885 --> 00:39:03,332
It was quite fast, so I guess we have quite some time for questions.

394
00:39:03,433 --> 00:39:04,214
So you are welcome.

395
00:39:08,022 --> 00:39:08,223
Hi.

396
00:39:08,706 --> 00:39:19,196
I was wondering, how do you balance environments that are more enjoyable to traverse with, like, walking versus a car?

397
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:23,660
Do you balance it strictly off of how much access the player will have to the car?

398
00:39:24,301 --> 00:39:31,327
Like, you know, if there's a point in the game where they actually gain access to that, is that when you would introduce environments that are more car-friendly?

399
00:39:32,008 --> 00:39:33,950
Just how would you balance those two modes of movement?

400
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:39,483
That's a great question, and I think it should be addressed to game designers.

401
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:44,887
No, honestly, I don't think that it's me who actually made this decision.

402
00:39:45,867 --> 00:39:51,371
I would say that, well, I mean, when I work in cities, I kind of make some assumptions.

403
00:39:52,172 --> 00:39:57,596
But, I don't know, pretty much at the end it will be different, because it's not me who made this decision.

404
00:39:58,056 --> 00:39:58,476
So, you know.

405
00:39:59,257 --> 00:39:59,557
Thank you.

406
00:40:02,959 --> 00:40:08,785
Hi, I was wondering, you talked about different neighborhoods having different visual identities.

407
00:40:09,146 --> 00:40:16,354
I was wondering about how the intersections of those neighborhoods work, like how they blend into one another so you can move from one to the other seamlessly.

408
00:40:17,300 --> 00:40:18,441
That's a great question, thank you.

409
00:40:19,282 --> 00:40:20,583
So, actually it depends.

410
00:40:20,723 --> 00:40:25,267
And basically we can go like in two directions.

411
00:40:26,308 --> 00:40:33,234
Or we can make this intersection, well not, I guess not intersection, but border between those neighborhoods very contrast.

412
00:40:33,894 --> 00:40:42,058
So if a player moves there, they would immediately understand that they went to a different area.

413
00:40:42,519 --> 00:40:45,440
Or it can be really smooth.

414
00:40:46,781 --> 00:40:49,022
There will be no border, and this difference would be smooth.

415
00:40:49,422 --> 00:40:52,264
So the simplest way, I guess, to

416
00:40:53,124 --> 00:40:53,725
make a

417
00:41:08,788 --> 00:41:33,381
transition or again contrast also works great because like you know for example you can have this really nice and fancy neighborhood and then you make a turn and suddenly you are in like poor really you know dangerous area so it also might work it depends on what well like what's your intention what what you want to you know bring to player thank you

418
00:41:37,490 --> 00:41:41,054
Any thoughts on how a small team could make a big, interesting city?

419
00:41:41,314 --> 00:41:42,415
Or is that just impossible?

420
00:41:43,256 --> 00:41:43,616
Once again?

421
00:41:44,097 --> 00:41:46,359
A small team making a big city?

422
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:50,123
Well, it will be challenging, I guess.

423
00:41:50,943 --> 00:41:59,372
I mean, of course, for example, maybe if you have 10 years or maybe a century, then... Thank you.

424
00:42:01,950 --> 00:42:07,315
I saw that on the presentation you had a picture of Vienna as a reference but in grayscale.

425
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:09,097
What was the purpose on that?

426
00:42:10,707 --> 00:42:25,090
I mean, particularly on that slide, it was just an exercise, because I just wanted to take something that seems absolutely irrelevant to cyberpunk, because, come on, like, old city in Vienna and cyberpunk, it's something absolutely, you know, not connected to each other.

427
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:36,633
But I just wanted to show how we can use references, you know, because, you know, something that would obviously come to your mind to actually check some, you know, this modern cities,

428
00:42:38,353 --> 00:42:46,121
Yeah, but also you can go this way and maybe you will find something fresh, something, you know, something different, something that was never used before.

429
00:42:46,662 --> 00:42:48,003
So only because of that.

430
00:42:48,123 --> 00:42:49,925
That example was quite random, to be honest.

431
00:42:50,225 --> 00:42:50,666
Ah, okay.

432
00:42:50,806 --> 00:42:51,647
Yeah, thank you.

433
00:42:51,847 --> 00:42:53,128
Thank you for sharing your knowledge.

434
00:42:53,228 --> 00:42:53,749
It was awesome.

435
00:42:54,289 --> 00:42:54,630
Thank you.

436
00:42:57,372 --> 00:43:01,677
I was just curious when working on a city, more so, I guess, a top-down city,

437
00:43:02,408 --> 00:43:09,112
When you're trying to spawn in enemies, what's a good way to do it without having it be like, oh, this is where the enemy spawns?

438
00:43:09,372 --> 00:43:15,375
How do you make it feel organic or like, oh, they're now coming for you because you did something or so forth?

439
00:43:15,876 --> 00:43:21,359
Yeah, so one more question to quest designers, I guess, because I have no idea where to spawn enemies.

440
00:43:21,879 --> 00:43:22,139
Sorry.

441
00:43:27,577 --> 00:43:28,778
Hi, thank you so much.

442
00:43:29,379 --> 00:43:39,386
I guess, like, one question that I had was, obviously, like, urban planning and level design has a lot to do, like, works very closely with, like, quests and systems and that kind of thing.

443
00:43:39,886 --> 00:43:49,673
And in my own experience, I've had a lot of times where the environment has shaped how we, like, how we set up the quest or vice versa.

444
00:43:50,134 --> 00:43:57,019
I guess I'm just wondering if you have any examples off the top of your head where you had a particularly challenging, like, moment where

445
00:43:57,397 --> 00:44:10,190
you were really trying to either bend the environment to the quest, or vice versa, doing something to make the environment work for the design goals of the game?

446
00:44:11,732 --> 00:44:18,018
Well, honestly, this work always goes in really close cooperation.

447
00:44:19,840 --> 00:44:24,904
I mean, I don't think there ever was any kind of conflict of interest or something.

448
00:44:25,084 --> 00:44:28,626
Or if it was, we tried to deal with it in the very beginning.

449
00:44:28,907 --> 00:44:34,130
So, I mean, you know, yeah, it's about teamwork and cooperation, I guess.

450
00:44:34,230 --> 00:44:39,414
And I don't think, I think maybe I'm telling, like, very boring things that everyone knows.

451
00:44:39,494 --> 00:44:41,916
But yeah, it's about cooperation and teamwork.

452
00:44:41,956 --> 00:44:47,360
Like, if you work together from the very beginning, you know what gameplay needs.

453
00:44:47,820 --> 00:44:47,860
Hi.

454
00:45:08,602 --> 00:45:20,487
So I have a question in relation to multi-tiered cities, like if you have regular street layouts, but imagine you have also flying cars and you have multiple layers of street level, if you will.

455
00:45:20,687 --> 00:45:25,149
So if you have a street, but it's taller, think sixth element, but maybe also some cyberpunk.

456
00:45:26,089 --> 00:45:32,612
So do you have any insight in city layout regarding that, or is that out of scope of cyberpunk?

457
00:45:34,805 --> 00:45:34,885
of

458
00:45:50,187 --> 00:45:59,489
Of course, if we can go just up to the sky to, I don't know, to stratosphere and just, you know, wandering there on top, then, I don't know, and, you know, it's a little bit different, I guess.

459
00:46:00,089 --> 00:46:16,512
But still, like, if we move along the street, okay, yeah, it can be not a street level, but higher, but it makes no difference because still you are in the street, the street has direction, you still have some intersections, like, you still, for example, you know that

460
00:46:17,112 --> 00:46:21,194
I don't know, maybe you have a map, you know where you have to go, and that's it, you just move.

461
00:46:21,474 --> 00:46:25,356
And, you know, it doesn't matter whether you move on the ground or above.

462
00:46:26,056 --> 00:46:31,839
Yeah, I mean, there are tunnels and lower areas below buildings in the cyberpunk environment as well as cyberpunk.

463
00:46:31,859 --> 00:46:34,380
Sorry, could you please speak closer to the microphone?

464
00:46:34,620 --> 00:46:42,584
Sorry, there are multi-tier levels within cyberpunk, like the tunnels underneath the buildings and the bridges or buildings with bridges in between.

465
00:46:42,684 --> 00:46:44,445
So it's kind of the same, I guess.

466
00:46:45,219 --> 00:47:08,174
Well, yeah, but again, like you can, of course here I showed maybe like simpler examples because, you know, just to bring my ideas, but you can make this structure even more complicated because again, so for example, you decided, okay, so this neighborhood or couple of neighborhoods will have this complicated multi-level structure.

467
00:47:09,014 --> 00:47:14,398
Like this is important to decide it at some point and then you just start, you know, making block out, you know.

468
00:47:15,318 --> 00:47:15,578
All right.

469
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:15,958
Thank you.

470
00:47:18,900 --> 00:47:19,140
Hello.

471
00:47:20,161 --> 00:47:20,721
Great talk.

472
00:47:20,761 --> 00:47:25,323
I really appreciate your breakdown of the process and the abstraction of it.

473
00:47:26,644 --> 00:47:37,109
The person ahead of me actually kind of already asked my question, but I would like to, if you're OK with it, get further characterization on your communication with mission designers and

474
00:47:41,434 --> 00:47:50,746
Would you further characterize your interaction with other team members as far as placement of points of interest, ambient resources, things that promote player agency in the cityscape?

475
00:47:52,725 --> 00:47:53,906
I guess the answer is yes.

476
00:47:55,167 --> 00:48:03,193
I mean, well, yeah, I always, if I understood the question correct, so yeah, I always taking this to account.

477
00:48:03,594 --> 00:48:06,556
And for example, I know that, okay, this is our point of interest.

478
00:48:06,576 --> 00:48:10,679
For example, this is landmark and it should be something that should be visible.

479
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:12,781
So yeah, it would affect my layout.

480
00:48:13,201 --> 00:48:14,102
For example, I would,

481
00:48:15,263 --> 00:48:19,305
orient the streets toward this place, these points of interest.

482
00:48:20,285 --> 00:48:25,907
Because, yeah, when you're creating a layout, it's a really powerful tool and you can make it really visible.

483
00:48:26,427 --> 00:48:30,109
You can make it in a way that it would immediately catch players' attention.

484
00:48:30,829 --> 00:48:33,130
And, yeah, this is our work, pretty much.

485
00:48:33,650 --> 00:48:39,472
Yeah, I'm just interested in, would you characterize some of the more successful communication team members, what that looks like?

486
00:48:40,266 --> 00:48:42,248
Sorry, could you again closer to microphone?

487
00:48:42,589 --> 00:48:42,989
Is this better?

488
00:48:43,229 --> 00:48:44,290
Oh, that's so much better.

489
00:48:44,571 --> 00:49:01,308
Oh, that is embarrassing Okay, I'd be interested in hearing you characterize some of the communication processes between like mission designers and quest designers and your work as far as placement goes and a timeline or something like that or whatever you come up with

490
00:49:03,553 --> 00:49:07,596
I mean, well, the communication process, well, it's good.

491
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:14,640
I mean, the processes are built really great in our company and all designers that I work with, they are my friends.

492
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:17,181
And we often, like, we have

493
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,724
like brainstorms, and we discuss things together.

494
00:49:21,784 --> 00:49:27,748
It's not like I'm just sitting in my box, drawing something, and then just bring it to the table, like, here, I made it.

495
00:49:28,049 --> 00:49:28,869
No, it's not like that.

496
00:49:28,949 --> 00:49:33,533
We're always, like, in touch, and we're creating things together.

497
00:49:34,133 --> 00:49:45,721
And even, like, again, when it comes to city, it's not like, it's really hard to, it's not like hard, it's impossible to name a person who created a city, because it's not person, it's like whole team, and we create this together.

498
00:49:47,122 --> 00:49:47,863
Outstanding, thank you.

499
00:49:49,812 --> 00:49:50,072
Hello.

500
00:49:50,913 --> 00:49:57,918
So while obviously Night City is a very big video game space, it's I think fair to say quite a bit smaller than an equivalent real world city.

501
00:49:57,938 --> 00:50:13,130
And I guess I was wondering if you could speak a little more about how some of these techniques go to creating that sort of illusion of scale and making it feel closer to like an enormous sort of mega city real world environment while being geometrically a lot smaller than say like a Los Angeles type environment.

502
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:13,430
Thank you.

503
00:50:14,313 --> 00:50:17,036
You see, it's all about perception.

504
00:50:17,096 --> 00:50:20,619
Because it's like this example that I gave in the very beginning.

505
00:50:20,679 --> 00:50:26,084
So if you have to go somewhere for 15 minutes in real life, it's OK.

506
00:50:26,185 --> 00:50:26,925
It's super close.

507
00:50:26,965 --> 00:50:29,227
But if you have to walk for 15 minutes in game,

508
00:50:29,908 --> 00:50:32,331
you would just close this game and never open it again, right?

509
00:50:32,791 --> 00:50:34,613
So it's always like that.

510
00:50:35,414 --> 00:50:37,196
Game proportions, they're always smaller.

511
00:50:37,576 --> 00:50:38,156
It's OK.

512
00:50:39,418 --> 00:50:44,503
I cannot give you a certain formula, for example, like some coefficient that you should use when you create it.

513
00:50:44,623 --> 00:50:47,366
And pretty much, it doesn't exist because

514
00:50:49,367 --> 00:51:01,375
Again, it depends on the type of movement, because maybe in some cases you have to use proportions that would be quite close to a real city, because, for example, if you move really fast, then why not?

515
00:51:02,856 --> 00:51:08,299
But yeah, if you're mostly walking or walking-slash-driving, you have to be smart about the sizes.

516
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:14,202
I don't know, like I would say that, yeah, again, there is no formula.

517
00:51:14,642 --> 00:51:18,863
It's only like empiric way that you can just, you know, trials and failures.

518
00:51:19,263 --> 00:51:26,566
So, you know, you just create, you can create like a few streets, walk there or drive there or fly or wherever you need.

519
00:51:27,206 --> 00:51:30,048
And just, just ask yourself, okay, is it comfortable?

520
00:51:30,308 --> 00:51:31,008
Do I like it?

521
00:51:31,268 --> 00:51:31,688
And that's it.

522
00:51:32,128 --> 00:51:34,729
And once the answer is yes, this is your proportions.

523
00:51:35,570 --> 00:51:35,870
Wonderful.

524
00:51:35,890 --> 00:51:36,150
Thank you.

525
00:51:38,571 --> 00:51:38,711
Hello.

526
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:48,407
I just wanted to ask, what's the design process to decide between having a playable or interactive POI compared to a bottomless POI?

527
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:56,191
It sounds like if it's visible from every location, wouldn't it just push itself to be an area of more interest or interactive gameplay?

528
00:51:57,868 --> 00:51:59,549
Damn, I don't think I understood the question.

529
00:51:59,609 --> 00:52:00,049
I'm sorry.

530
00:52:01,110 --> 00:52:09,274
What's the difference between the design process to create something more interactive compared to a bottomless POI, kind of like what you showed in the slides?

531
00:52:10,075 --> 00:52:15,357
OK, so again, it's something that we decided together with

532
00:52:16,718 --> 00:52:21,159
I don't know, lore team, game design team, and initiative on their side.

533
00:52:21,819 --> 00:52:28,940
So, I mean, I can suggest something, of course, but, like, the final word, I guess, after them.

534
00:52:30,221 --> 00:52:36,322
And, yeah, I guess it's really, again, it's really hard for me to answer because I think they rule the process.

535
00:52:36,742 --> 00:52:36,882
Yeah.

536
00:52:36,902 --> 00:52:37,622
All right.

537
00:52:37,862 --> 00:52:38,382
Thank you.

538
00:52:41,303 --> 00:52:41,603
Hello.

539
00:52:41,743 --> 00:52:42,263
Can you hear me okay?

540
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:45,812
Thank you for the talk, first of all.

541
00:52:46,812 --> 00:52:55,674
You mentioned that it's often good to have streets lead to or highlight nearby landmarks, and based on your responses to some other questions, it seems pretty important in your design flow.

542
00:52:56,934 --> 00:53:02,776
How much are you or other level designers willing to bend or change the streets that you've made or the layout to frame landmarks?

543
00:53:02,916 --> 00:53:10,418
And in the event where that might not be possible just because of the layout of the city, is there like a second best option for a street to highlight or direct to?

544
00:53:13,440 --> 00:53:23,284
Okay, so I think this situation won't be possible if, again, if you work together from the very beginning.

545
00:53:23,504 --> 00:53:34,928
You know, I kind of have this feeling that some of you really want to force me that, yeah, we have fight, we actually go to a ring, we fight, and someone who wins, this is how we make it.

546
00:53:35,128 --> 00:53:36,049
No, it's not the case.

547
00:53:37,109 --> 00:53:39,410
So yeah, we worked together from the very beginning.

548
00:53:40,650 --> 00:53:49,313
And again, it's a very iterative process, because I can provide, not like me, but my team maybe can provide some drafts.

549
00:53:49,993 --> 00:53:54,595
We can discuss it with level designers, with lore team, with quest designers, whoever is interested.

550
00:53:55,495 --> 00:54:11,381
and we have like this first approval or maybe they suggest some things to maybe change something, we work on it, then we meet again and you know and this is like really long process from the very beginning till the very end I guess and I think

551
00:54:12,281 --> 00:54:24,646
This is not a case where, for example, we are closer to the end, and then suddenly level designers or, I don't know, quest designers saw that, hey, it's completely not something that we expected.

552
00:54:24,906 --> 00:54:25,746
No, it's impossible.

553
00:54:27,147 --> 00:54:27,687
OK, thank you.

554
00:54:31,102 --> 00:54:31,343
Hello.

555
00:54:32,903 --> 00:54:37,205
When designing environments, we have to balance the familiar and the new.

556
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:51,992
Since we can only do so much weird, innovative, and unique stuff with cities before the player gets confused, how do you determine what to spend effort on making new and unfamiliar, and what to just keep basic, normal, boring city?

557
00:54:54,013 --> 00:54:56,394
That's a tricky question.

558
00:55:01,780 --> 00:55:05,130
I'm confused to be honest because I don't think that I understood the question, I'm sorry.

559
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:09,556
I guess the question of, I mean, it's the 80-20 rule.

560
00:55:09,676 --> 00:55:15,301
You do 80% is familiar to the player and 20% is like new and different.

561
00:55:16,082 --> 00:55:24,509
So when building a futuristic cyberpunk city, how do you determine what to make familiar that anyone can understand?

562
00:55:25,030 --> 00:55:30,595
And how do you determine, okay, this is worth putting energy, making new, exciting and something no one's seen before?

563
00:55:31,449 --> 00:55:32,370
OK, that's interesting.

564
00:55:32,470 --> 00:55:32,770
I don't know.

565
00:55:32,810 --> 00:55:40,557
I think it's intuitive process, I think, because I don't think that, like, OK, I don't have any guidelines.

566
00:55:40,737 --> 00:55:48,765
I don't have any formula that, I don't know, that every 100 meters, we should have something unexpected.

567
00:55:49,165 --> 00:55:49,365
No.

568
00:55:50,226 --> 00:55:56,191
So you see, like, this process, like I said, it's very iterative process.

569
00:55:56,732 --> 00:55:57,352
And again, like,

570
00:55:58,554 --> 00:56:04,119
We started with very drafts and we tried to walk around our cities.

571
00:56:04,759 --> 00:56:13,007
And yeah, at some point if we feel that, okay, it feels boring, then let's kind of change it.

572
00:56:13,368 --> 00:56:15,490
And if it's not, then let's move forward.

573
00:56:15,850 --> 00:56:22,336
So I don't know, I would say for me, when I'm creating some city layouts, I have this kind of approach in my mind that

574
00:56:23,217 --> 00:56:30,503
I imagine myself as a tourist that, you know, just wandering around because at this very stages we don't have any gameplay, like we have nothing maybe.

575
00:56:31,124 --> 00:56:34,787
And there's nothing, there's no activities at this very early stages.

576
00:56:35,187 --> 00:56:37,969
So I just, I just imagine that I'm a tourist.

577
00:56:38,329 --> 00:56:39,430
I just came in the city.

578
00:56:39,490 --> 00:56:41,472
I just wandering around, making pictures.

579
00:56:41,852 --> 00:56:43,834
So I like, you should answer yourself.

580
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:44,114
Okay.

581
00:56:44,234 --> 00:56:45,495
Would you make a picture of this?

582
00:56:45,575 --> 00:56:47,557
Would you post it into your, I don't know, Instagram?

583
00:56:48,137 --> 00:56:49,559
If yes, then you're good.

584
00:56:50,619 --> 00:56:50,840
Okay.

585
00:56:50,920 --> 00:56:51,240
Thank you.

586
00:56:54,444 --> 00:57:22,357
Hi, I just had a quick question about when you're designing a city and you don't have access to visual landmarks, so when you're designing like back alleys and things like that, what kind of strategies do you have to give like a visual dialogue to the player of like, hey, this is like a good direction to get to like a main point or like this is where you would move to kind of, here's your like flow area towards your quest without just using

587
00:57:23,798 --> 00:57:25,420
like quest markers and stuff like that.

588
00:57:25,560 --> 00:57:29,085
The thing that comes to mind is like V's apartment at the very beginning of the game.

589
00:57:29,605 --> 00:57:31,688
It's kind of like a complex space to navigate.

590
00:57:31,868 --> 00:57:38,717
I just was curious what strategies you have for allowing the player to navigate that without too much confusion.

591
00:57:40,998 --> 00:57:47,780
So, OK, I need to think how to answer it best, to not repeat myself.

592
00:57:47,820 --> 00:57:50,821
So again, like I said, we work all together.

593
00:57:50,941 --> 00:57:53,562
And I can maybe make some suggestions.

594
00:57:53,662 --> 00:57:56,403
For example, I can say, OK, so here we have this landmark.

595
00:57:56,843 --> 00:57:58,644
And there are multiple streets that go there.

596
00:57:59,184 --> 00:58:00,985
And then we just check if it works or not.

597
00:58:01,105 --> 00:58:06,229
Like, if it's visible, if it's, like, you know, fit the quest.

598
00:58:06,289 --> 00:58:09,371
So again, like, yeah, you ask about strategies?

599
00:58:09,951 --> 00:58:10,792
No, I guess there are none.

600
00:58:10,912 --> 00:58:12,133
Like, it's not about strategies.

601
00:58:12,213 --> 00:58:14,654
It's about trials and failures, I would say.

602
00:58:15,715 --> 00:58:22,599
And again, maybe what also matters is that, you know, that kind of visual gallery that I already have in my head because I have a lot of

603
00:58:24,260 --> 00:58:24,821
examples.

604
00:58:25,281 --> 00:58:38,047
So I can, for example, I know if I think about some situation, I can think, ah, OK, I think I saw something like that in certain city that might work in our game.

605
00:58:38,367 --> 00:58:42,489
And then, for example, I can try to make fast draft of this layout and check if it works.

606
00:58:42,549 --> 00:58:47,111
Because again, I don't think that I'm creating this just from my head.

607
00:58:47,311 --> 00:58:50,253
I actually try to use some existing things because

608
00:58:51,073 --> 00:58:53,115
You know, we have everything in real life.

609
00:58:53,155 --> 00:58:54,656
We can just use it, just take it.

610
00:58:56,077 --> 00:58:56,877
Thank you very much.

611
00:58:57,958 --> 00:59:03,862
Yeah, and I think maybe one last question and we can just continue somewhere outside.

612
00:59:04,943 --> 00:59:05,203
All right.

613
00:59:05,844 --> 00:59:06,644
I have a question.

614
00:59:07,285 --> 00:59:11,328
You didn't mention anything about public transportation in urban planning.

615
00:59:11,408 --> 00:59:14,330
And I was thinking there is a metro system in Night City, as far as I remember.

616
00:59:14,830 --> 00:59:16,472
How does that affect sort of the layout

617
00:59:20,350 --> 00:59:24,652
Should I maybe send you to our PR department?

618
00:59:28,434 --> 00:59:33,036
I mean... Kasper, help me.

619
00:59:35,277 --> 00:59:38,519
What?

620
00:59:38,539 --> 00:59:39,439
That's a good one, yeah.

621
00:59:41,816 --> 00:59:56,701
So, I mean, no, seriously, I don't know, like, you know that Metro, it appears like in the very last patches, so, you know, in the very early stages, I guess it didn't affect much.

622
00:59:57,621 --> 00:59:58,481
That's it, I guess.

623
00:59:58,862 --> 00:59:59,282
Thank you.

624
00:59:59,722 --> 01:00:00,002
No worries.
