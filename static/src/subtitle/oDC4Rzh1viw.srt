00:00:06,656 --> 00:00:17,222
Hello everyone. Thanks for coming. I'm curious by a show of hands, who is here on a student

2
00:00:17,282 --> 00:00:24,927
pass? There's quite a few. That's nice. Thanks for coming to the career seminar. This is

3
00:00:24,987 --> 00:00:32,151
the final talk of the day. I planned this thing. So if, please rate all the talks so

4
00:00:32,191 --> 00:00:34,433
that we know what kinds of things you like.

5
00:00:35,181 --> 00:00:36,583
and can bring back next year.

6
00:00:37,484 --> 00:00:40,627
And this final talk is three postmortems

7
00:00:40,787 --> 00:00:42,369
of three different types of games

8
00:00:42,509 --> 00:00:43,831
from three different people.

9
00:00:44,552 --> 00:00:47,014
And we'll just get started, because it'll

10
00:00:47,034 --> 00:00:48,856
be pretty self-explanatory, with Ah-Joo Moon.

11
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:04,124
Hi, thanks, I'm Audrey Moon, and so there's definitely going to be some contrast in our project types.

12
00:01:04,224 --> 00:01:08,328
I'm going to be giving a post-mortem on a like very personal interactive art piece,

13
00:01:09,349 --> 00:01:11,131
and since it's kind of a different project,

14
00:01:11,151 --> 00:01:16,356
I'm going to go ahead and just play the quick 30-second trailer so you can get an idea of what I'll be talking about.

15
00:01:36,325 --> 00:01:37,807
What do you see?

16
00:01:37,947 --> 00:01:38,828
I don't know.

17
00:01:38,848 --> 00:01:43,892
Alright, so the name of the project is Into, and, um...

18
00:02:02,489 --> 00:02:05,670
So first let's start with a bit about me.

19
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:10,432
So Audrey and I do development, design, and storytelling.

20
00:02:10,452 --> 00:02:13,113
I'm kind of like a hybrid artist

21
00:02:13,473 --> 00:02:15,634
with a big background doing UI UX design.

22
00:02:16,114 --> 00:02:17,494
And so coming into this project,

23
00:02:17,514 --> 00:02:20,755
I was mostly doing it solo and experimenting

24
00:02:20,855 --> 00:02:23,536
with kind of like a lot of new design techniques,

25
00:02:25,957 --> 00:02:28,538
and also a lot of like kind of just weird coding tricks

26
00:02:28,578 --> 00:02:29,178
so I can just.

27
00:02:29,943 --> 00:02:32,745
kind of quickly rehash a narrative experience.

28
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:39,830
Then let's talk about, let's see.

29
00:02:42,172 --> 00:02:44,394
So when I started the project into,

30
00:02:44,434 --> 00:02:46,936
it actually came, it was branched off

31
00:02:47,036 --> 00:02:49,217
from another project I had started working on

32
00:02:50,138 --> 00:02:52,380
that was kind of this science fiction story

33
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,662
and it dealt a lot with about.

34
00:02:56,277 --> 00:02:59,861
thinking about the separation of consciousness from bodies

35
00:02:59,921 --> 00:03:02,063
and had elements of body swapping.

36
00:03:02,083 --> 00:03:04,025
And I was thinking, oh, it's this really cool

37
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:06,547
contemplation on existence.

38
00:03:06,647 --> 00:03:10,431
But so I thought I was having a good prototype going.

39
00:03:10,571 --> 00:03:13,074
I took some time off of work to,

40
00:03:13,795 --> 00:03:15,857
I was thought, oh, I'll spend like three to six months

41
00:03:15,917 --> 00:03:18,179
working on this project, get a prototype together,

42
00:03:18,279 --> 00:03:18,960
see what happens.

43
00:03:21,424 --> 00:03:26,628
two weeks of spending full-time work on this project, I realized, like, a lot of internal

44
00:03:26,668 --> 00:03:32,171
truths. I was like, oh, this story is all about how I am transgender and I'm having all these,

45
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:37,715
like, hidden feelings inside of me that I was putting into this story that I hadn't yet dealt

46
00:03:37,735 --> 00:03:43,179
with. So after I realized that, you know, it kind of hit me pretty hard. I wasn't ready to tackle

47
00:03:43,359 --> 00:03:48,703
that subject matter yet. And I also had realized with the scope, there were some technical things

48
00:03:50,223 --> 00:03:52,085
dealing with animated characters and inverse kinematics

49
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:53,246
and some screen space effects

50
00:03:53,746 --> 00:03:55,307
that I just wanted to practice on

51
00:03:55,327 --> 00:03:58,689
before putting onto this giant, larger project.

52
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:03,232
So, yeah, that's what brought me to this project.

53
00:04:03,512 --> 00:04:06,134
Into, or I turned my autobiography

54
00:04:06,174 --> 00:04:08,015
into a fictional second-person surreal

55
00:04:08,096 --> 00:04:10,957
coming out of age dramedy, and now my life is happier.

56
00:04:10,977 --> 00:04:13,259
This was like...

57
00:04:14,072 --> 00:04:18,274
I enjoyed the name and it worked for me since it was just a little art project that I wasn't

58
00:04:18,294 --> 00:04:22,736
expecting to make money off of, but it was kind of a terrible naming choice because,

59
00:04:22,756 --> 00:04:28,438
for example, it's released on Itch.io and the search engine on Itch.io just excludes

60
00:04:28,458 --> 00:04:31,339
the word into from searching.

61
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,162
So you cannot search it by typing in like the actual title, only if you type in one

62
00:04:37,202 --> 00:04:38,502
of the words in the subtitle.

63
00:04:41,604 --> 00:04:45,245
And yeah, so since this project is dealing with

64
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:50,127
some design and technical implementation choices

65
00:04:50,227 --> 00:04:54,308
on the project and it deals with a lot of personal things

66
00:04:54,388 --> 00:04:57,769
I was dealing with while writing it,

67
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:01,831
it's going to be a post-mortem,

68
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,131
like a little bit on the project

69
00:05:03,291 --> 00:05:06,912
and a little bit of a post-mortem on this chapter of my life.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:11,383
I'm not dead. It's not like actually a postmortem, but on me.

71
00:05:13,784 --> 00:05:21,150
And so let's see when I was kind of forming the ideas, I had ideas coming from all over the place and

72
00:05:22,231 --> 00:05:37,303
That I was thinking about different design and technical issues and eventually this kind of perfect storm came together of, oh, I need to make this project because it's kind of what I'm interested in working on now. It's technically feasible for me and it's relevant to my life.

73
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:44,085
And one of the things that got me started with wanting to make an interactive narrative project

74
00:05:44,426 --> 00:05:49,350
in the form it is, is because I've been playing through Kentucky Route Zero and a couple of other

75
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:55,835
things with some friends at the time, and I was realizing like how awkward it is to

76
00:05:57,356 --> 00:06:03,361
go through dialogue and click through dialogue boxes, especially textual ones, with other people

77
00:06:03,401 --> 00:06:04,962
that like read at different speeds.

78
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:12,804
And the same thing is kind of true with anything like Mass Effect or any other game that lets you pause for choices.

79
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:20,149
Like, they work well, but really, like, if all you did was post a video of it and someone didn't know it was from a video game,

80
00:06:20,609 --> 00:06:24,472
and you had all these pauses in between conversation options, it would be kind of like,

81
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:26,833
well, why are there all these awkward pauses?

82
00:06:26,873 --> 00:06:30,896
There's like a dramatic moment where someone says something and the other character just stares blankly into their eyes

83
00:06:30,996 --> 00:06:33,558
while they're like, thinking of four different sentences.

84
00:06:34,079 --> 00:06:37,541
And so I was thinking about how to design a project that

85
00:06:38,282 --> 00:06:42,985
isn't necessarily going to be full time or fully

86
00:06:43,025 --> 00:06:44,306
controlled with time like a film.

87
00:06:44,827 --> 00:06:48,469
But in the design itself, it actually accommodates it.

88
00:06:48,509 --> 00:06:51,151
So no matter how long you wait, it

89
00:06:51,171 --> 00:06:54,114
will feel like it was a natural lull in the conversation.

90
00:06:54,134 --> 00:06:59,918
And so basically, one of the solutions to that was,

91
00:06:59,958 --> 00:07:02,080
well, what's a conversation like?

92
00:07:02,562 --> 00:07:05,862
when you're pausing in between every sentence you say,

93
00:07:05,882 --> 00:07:09,063
well, that may be like hard conversations

94
00:07:09,303 --> 00:07:11,684
or maybe awkward teenagers talking to each other.

95
00:07:11,704 --> 00:07:16,025
And so, like, that was one reason why I felt like

96
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,426
this was something to tackle,

97
00:07:17,506 --> 00:07:22,107
because I had this little like memory of my life

98
00:07:22,187 --> 00:07:25,448
that I was kind of incorporating into a fictitious story.

99
00:07:25,828 --> 00:07:27,448
So it's semi-autobiographical.

100
00:07:28,032 --> 00:07:31,114
But basically it was like a young, awkward version of me

101
00:07:31,194 --> 00:07:33,415
trying to have conversation with someone in fiction.

102
00:07:34,336 --> 00:07:37,417
And I felt like, well, that's the perfect thing

103
00:07:37,437 --> 00:07:40,279
because I might want to just sit there for like five minutes

104
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,660
while thinking about what to say next.

105
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:44,722
And so with all that stuff going to my head,

106
00:07:44,742 --> 00:07:46,302
it all started with a dream.

107
00:07:46,322 --> 00:07:50,645
I had a dream one night where there were just these

108
00:07:50,685 --> 00:07:52,726
like two characters in my head.

109
00:07:52,746 --> 00:07:53,486
I knew who they were.

110
00:07:54,901 --> 00:07:58,103
and I saw their bodies on each side of the screen like this

111
00:07:58,643 --> 00:08:01,345
and eventually they came together and merged in the middle.

112
00:08:01,465 --> 00:08:02,686
And I woke up in the middle of the night

113
00:08:02,726 --> 00:08:04,267
at like three or four a.m. and I was like,

114
00:08:05,067 --> 00:08:07,589
I gotta figure out how to do this screen space effect

115
00:08:07,889 --> 00:08:11,131
because it's exactly what I was wanting to learn

116
00:08:11,431 --> 00:08:12,792
to put into my other project.

117
00:08:13,272 --> 00:08:16,374
So I got up, I fleshed this scene out

118
00:08:16,774 --> 00:08:20,816
and I thought, well, this is really cool.

119
00:08:21,787 --> 00:08:27,970
And I ended up writing the whole and ended up being the climactic scene in the project and I wrote the rest of it

120
00:08:28,690 --> 00:08:29,511
To lead up to it

121
00:08:30,491 --> 00:08:30,932
So yeah

122
00:08:30,952 --> 00:08:36,755
I had to work with a multiple camera setup and death mask to get a lot of effects in the first thing I

123
00:08:36,835 --> 00:08:39,236
Implemented was this is only part of the scene

124
00:08:39,816 --> 00:08:44,619
But it deals with when the characters start to reach into each other and then fade into each other

125
00:08:44,639 --> 00:08:47,260
and then

126
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:50,742
Once that was in place and I had this death map shader going

127
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:56,680
I just started putting the death mask everywhere. I was like cool, like I have this shader let's

128
00:08:56,700 --> 00:09:03,605
just see where I can put it. So dialogue conversation prompts became masked out views into

129
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:11,071
just trying to get an idea of like what is on the character's mind and always kind of focusing the

130
00:09:11,111 --> 00:09:16,975
conversations into the character's heads. And then another aspect of this was dealing with

131
00:09:17,035 --> 00:09:19,076
human bodies and making characters touch.

132
00:09:20,317 --> 00:09:26,719
So I also started going through a lot of different experiments with inverse kinematics.

133
00:09:27,740 --> 00:09:32,381
And this was one of my first attempts at hand coding the inverse kinematics.

134
00:09:32,601 --> 00:09:35,963
Obviously it kind of worked, but the math was a little wrong.

135
00:09:38,203 --> 00:09:43,065
And so then I, that was for a Mixamo character asset, then I pulled in like the default Unity kid.

136
00:09:44,376 --> 00:09:48,078
And it was, yeah, it started off you seeing the top left,

137
00:09:48,158 --> 00:09:51,820
like for some reason it kept going sideways,

138
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:55,262
reaching for the cylinder, and also spinning.

139
00:09:56,242 --> 00:09:59,864
And eventually I did, touch was achieved.

140
00:10:00,504 --> 00:10:02,745
And I was able to make characters touch things

141
00:10:02,805 --> 00:10:03,866
and I could control their acting.

142
00:10:03,906 --> 00:10:08,088
However, it was like, obviously a lot of struggle

143
00:10:08,148 --> 00:10:10,669
to get it to work as complexly as I wanted to.

144
00:10:10,789 --> 00:10:12,630
So I was looking, I found this cool plugin.

145
00:10:13,157 --> 00:10:14,098
This is one of the demos.

146
00:10:14,158 --> 00:10:16,258
It was like, hey, you can make bodies interact

147
00:10:16,278 --> 00:10:17,139
with each other even.

148
00:10:17,159 --> 00:10:19,660
And so I started working.

149
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:22,341
It's, I think, called Fabric IK.

150
00:10:23,161 --> 00:10:27,022
And it made it really easy to just do anything

151
00:10:27,102 --> 00:10:29,323
with having the characters interact with actual objects

152
00:10:29,383 --> 00:10:29,863
or each other.

153
00:10:29,883 --> 00:10:32,945
And in the first scene, it's actually characters

154
00:10:32,985 --> 00:10:34,105
in this art class together.

155
00:10:34,565 --> 00:10:38,807
So I started putting together this whole system of like,

156
00:10:41,938 --> 00:10:44,999
Basically, it initially started with a broader design

157
00:10:45,019 --> 00:10:46,839
where you could dynamically have the characters

158
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:48,680
draw different things in a still life around the room,

159
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:50,160
and eventually it just turned into a thing

160
00:10:50,180 --> 00:10:51,400
where they're writing notes to each other.

161
00:10:53,101 --> 00:10:56,201
But it was just neat.

162
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:59,542
As soon as I figured out one way to do this IK system,

163
00:10:59,562 --> 00:11:01,382
I was able to use it in every scene in the game.

164
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,523
Yeah, and so compiled together

165
00:11:05,563 --> 00:11:07,103
with the depth max effects of the prompts,

166
00:11:07,623 --> 00:11:09,864
you get this kind of situation

167
00:11:09,944 --> 00:11:11,024
where the clickable target.

168
00:11:11,885 --> 00:11:13,866
is this fade out thing when you hover over it,

169
00:11:13,926 --> 00:11:16,427
it kind of like shrinks the thoughts together.

170
00:11:16,447 --> 00:11:20,289
And then you get to see visuals that looks like

171
00:11:20,309 --> 00:11:22,169
they're actually kind of writing a note to each other.

172
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,912
But also, this was my first project to do voice acting with,

173
00:11:26,932 --> 00:11:27,552
which was fun.

174
00:11:28,232 --> 00:11:31,013
And I wrote a screenplay, which was interesting.

175
00:11:31,033 --> 00:11:34,455
I got a Google Doc that had the format

176
00:11:34,475 --> 00:11:35,315
and it was kind of fun.

177
00:11:35,335 --> 00:11:37,256
I don't know if a screenplay is necessary,

178
00:11:37,316 --> 00:11:39,977
but this was a short project and it was easy to work with

179
00:11:39,997 --> 00:11:40,858
and it was easy to like.

180
00:11:41,329 --> 00:11:43,311
hand the script to people who's doing voice acting.

181
00:11:44,632 --> 00:11:46,573
And one of the important things was,

182
00:11:48,094 --> 00:11:50,556
before making anything final,

183
00:11:50,596 --> 00:11:53,299
I did all the voice acting just on my own,

184
00:11:53,439 --> 00:11:55,480
on my little microphone that's on my earbud mic,

185
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:58,863
just because I was kind of rewriting

186
00:11:58,883 --> 00:12:00,764
and developing the script as I went.

187
00:12:00,844 --> 00:12:03,987
So it was important for me to not put any effort

188
00:12:04,107 --> 00:12:05,528
into anything that I didn't think was final.

189
00:12:06,029 --> 00:12:07,330
So eventually though,

190
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,453
brought in the talented sound designer Jocelyn Reyes who did the music and the sound and also

191
00:12:12,473 --> 00:12:18,317
the recording. We recorded the voice acting in the closet under the stairs of the house I was

192
00:12:18,357 --> 00:12:26,261
living at the time. Gabrielle Genevieve who's an artist here in the room was the other me so we

193
00:12:26,301 --> 00:12:33,305
were the both the two characters on the different halves of the scene and Lucie Vitage-Lulou is

194
00:12:34,146 --> 00:12:36,907
an artist that's currently working up in Montreal from France.

195
00:12:37,323 --> 00:12:41,765
happened to be crashing on my couch at the time and it turned out you know she knew a lot about

196
00:12:41,825 --> 00:12:47,227
art and we just I just had her ad lib what it sounds like to be an art teacher and it actually

197
00:12:47,247 --> 00:12:52,709
that was this was a good example of like collaborating with someone um bring up really

198
00:12:52,789 --> 00:12:57,410
unexpected twists because her ad lib was like really humorous so I added a secret in the game

199
00:12:57,430 --> 00:13:01,132
where you could like instead of it just being muffled you could like listen to this ridiculous

200
00:13:01,232 --> 00:13:02,672
rambling about like

201
00:13:03,735 --> 00:13:04,935
what life is.

202
00:13:06,616 --> 00:13:08,377
And but it was kind of cool.

203
00:13:08,417 --> 00:13:13,039
I definitely found out working with voice actors, it was useful to not

204
00:13:13,739 --> 00:13:17,621
talk a lot about, oh, what is the character?

205
00:13:18,661 --> 00:13:19,762
What happened to the character?

206
00:13:19,802 --> 00:13:20,902
What are they thinking about?

207
00:13:21,582 --> 00:13:23,923
Because like you're recording things out of order.

208
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:25,600
and it doesn't necessarily matter.

209
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:28,081
It works a lot more to be very specific about,

210
00:13:28,102 --> 00:13:30,102
like, I want you to sound like this emotion

211
00:13:30,203 --> 00:13:33,384
or even like sample voice act for yourself to the actors

212
00:13:33,644 --> 00:13:34,765
so they get more of an idea.

213
00:13:35,165 --> 00:13:36,806
That made it a lot faster to work with.

214
00:13:37,606 --> 00:13:40,428
And it was also kind of funny because with Gabrielle and I,

215
00:13:40,448 --> 00:13:41,888
we were like recording some breathing

216
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:44,930
and we were in this little closet.

217
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:49,692
And so we got like really, we were hyperventilated

218
00:13:49,712 --> 00:13:51,413
and got really spaced out,

219
00:13:51,893 --> 00:13:53,334
breathing together in this closet.

220
00:13:54,209 --> 00:13:58,652
And but it worked out perfectly because the next scene where the two characters like lying,

221
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:03,936
the next thing we recorded were the two characters lying in bed together and like having this kind

222
00:14:03,956 --> 00:14:08,159
of spaced out conversation. So we were also like feeling kind of loopy at the time from lack of

223
00:14:08,259 --> 00:14:15,784
oxygen. So it worked out perfectly. And then it has a lot of like very careful framing of the scene

224
00:14:16,585 --> 00:14:21,188
and a key component in that because the camera view never showed like the full body of the

225
00:14:21,228 --> 00:14:21,748
characters.

226
00:14:22,393 --> 00:14:24,314
as there's a lot of cheats that you can do.

227
00:14:24,694 --> 00:14:27,575
The characters are always facing away from the camera,

228
00:14:27,595 --> 00:14:29,516
and you never saw below their bust,

229
00:14:29,676 --> 00:14:33,457
so it didn't matter if they were merged into each other.

230
00:14:35,138 --> 00:14:37,079
Which I guess is actually what happens in the end,

231
00:14:37,339 --> 00:14:38,099
I just realized.

232
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:43,041
So it's like foreshadowing if you go into developer view

233
00:14:43,081 --> 00:14:43,821
and look off screen.

234
00:14:45,842 --> 00:14:46,102
And then,

235
00:14:47,537 --> 00:14:52,898
The next up was, there is a bit where the characters will turn over and you'll see their eyes look at each other.

236
00:14:53,578 --> 00:14:59,139
But this is an example of when the character is faced away, it didn't matter if it wasn't realistic.

237
00:14:59,559 --> 00:15:02,780
By the time the head is turned, the eyes look like they're in a natural position.

238
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:06,821
And this is their default resting pose that happens all the time.

239
00:15:06,901 --> 00:15:10,902
So if you play this project, just know their eyes look like this all the time.

240
00:15:12,162 --> 00:15:12,783
But you don't see them.

241
00:15:13,983 --> 00:15:16,283
And so bringing all these elements together...

242
00:15:17,425 --> 00:15:20,887
I had a lot of, it was a lot of fun, there was a lot of issues.

243
00:15:21,027 --> 00:15:24,890
One was the fact that the pacing was so slow and mellow and it was just such a different

244
00:15:24,930 --> 00:15:29,273
project that it was all about the feel and the aesthetic and just pointing and clicking.

245
00:15:29,314 --> 00:15:31,215
There's not a lot of gameplay necessarily.

246
00:15:31,735 --> 00:15:35,738
So I ended up having to like design against games in a lot of ways.

247
00:15:36,699 --> 00:15:41,522
At least in the beginning it was almost like a tutorial to open it up and there's a long

248
00:15:41,562 --> 00:15:42,103
prolonged.

249
00:15:43,171 --> 00:15:49,176
section of just music with color fill screens that show the credits to kind of and then gradually

250
00:15:49,196 --> 00:15:55,221
um over time opening up more and more control to the character to the to the player so that they'll

251
00:15:55,261 --> 00:16:01,166
realize more readily like um oh i'm not this isn't like a first person game where i'm like going to

252
00:16:01,186 --> 00:16:04,889
be all over the place there's a very limited access constraint and so starting from a smaller

253
00:16:04,929 --> 00:16:10,773
place and gradually opening up to it made it like a very smooth transition and made it like

254
00:16:11,228 --> 00:16:13,350
I felt like people just got more out of it immediately.

255
00:16:16,873 --> 00:16:21,518
And also, yeah, I did a lot of rewriting, like I said.

256
00:16:21,538 --> 00:16:23,079
I did all the voice acting myself

257
00:16:23,900 --> 00:16:26,222
to begin with, like temporary, poor recordings.

258
00:16:27,083 --> 00:16:32,848
And it was interesting because as I was putting lines

259
00:16:33,149 --> 00:16:35,251
into the project, I

260
00:16:36,188 --> 00:16:40,590
was realizing, and it was since it was so personal too, I was realizing like, oh that's kind of like

261
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:46,034
a messed up way to think about myself. I need to rewrite it. And so I was doing this whole thing

262
00:16:46,454 --> 00:16:50,616
where I was like writing and designing this project, but also kind of designing myself

263
00:16:50,836 --> 00:16:54,278
at the same time. And then when bringing collaborators on, it was like some of the

264
00:16:54,318 --> 00:16:58,080
first time to have these conversations about these things. I hadn't talked with anyone,

265
00:16:58,361 --> 00:17:02,983
but I was like, we were talking about the game, we weren't talking about me. So it also like had

266
00:17:03,003 --> 00:17:05,485
this buffer where it was easy to have this conversation.

267
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:13,732
And that was like a really fortunate way to be able to design a thing and also work through

268
00:17:13,752 --> 00:17:20,234
these like tough feelings for myself. I was able to very carefully design the project so it

269
00:17:20,534 --> 00:17:26,216
included all the words that I wanted and also releasing it was actually me publicly coming out

270
00:17:26,716 --> 00:17:32,018
so I was really fortunate not everyone that does come out gets to control that message and the

271
00:17:32,058 --> 00:17:33,638
narrative and the audience in that way.

272
00:17:34,507 --> 00:17:36,948
And I guess I was just really scared,

273
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:39,449
so I had to have as much control as possible.

274
00:17:40,930 --> 00:17:43,811
Yeah, so that's all I'll talk about for right now.

275
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:44,812
Again, I'm Audrey Moon,

276
00:17:45,853 --> 00:17:47,914
and you can find me on Twitter at Animal Phase,

277
00:17:48,774 --> 00:17:50,595
or I'll be happy to talk to you after the panel.

278
00:17:50,655 --> 00:17:50,855
Thank you.

279
00:17:50,875 --> 00:17:51,055
Thank you.

280
00:17:51,095 --> 00:17:51,275
Thank you.

281
00:17:51,295 --> 00:17:51,515
Thank you.

282
00:17:51,535 --> 00:17:51,716
Thank you.

283
00:17:51,736 --> 00:17:53,276
Thank you.

284
00:17:53,416 --> 00:17:54,017
Thank you.

285
00:17:54,077 --> 00:17:54,877
Thank you.

286
00:17:54,917 --> 00:17:55,357
Thank you.

287
00:17:55,377 --> 00:17:55,838
Thank you.

288
00:17:55,858 --> 00:17:58,519
Thank you.

289
00:18:03,061 --> 00:18:03,281
Thank you.

290
00:18:03,301 --> 00:18:03,482
Thank you.

291
00:18:03,838 --> 00:18:04,338
A play button?

292
00:18:04,358 --> 00:18:04,919
All right, thank you.

293
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:06,220
Sorry.

294
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:09,102
I feel like a bit of a caveman on this machine.

295
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:12,465
My name's Dan.

296
00:18:13,766 --> 00:18:18,810
I'm a contract producer, designer type troubleshooter guy.

297
00:18:19,771 --> 00:18:24,275
And this is about Spider-Man Homecoming VR Experience,

298
00:18:25,295 --> 00:18:27,838
which we released at some point last year.

299
00:18:27,858 --> 00:18:28,898
I think it was in the summer.

300
00:18:29,999 --> 00:18:31,481
Everything's been kind of a blur since then.

301
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,621
Okay, so it's updating. Oh, there we go.

302
00:18:41,061 --> 00:18:42,942
Alright. Am I a second behind on this thing?

303
00:18:43,322 --> 00:18:44,762
No, you're okay. I'm okay? Alright.

304
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,584
Because of the time of the talk,

305
00:18:49,044 --> 00:18:51,244
I will not be playing the full Spider-Man theme.

306
00:18:51,825 --> 00:18:53,605
That's why you just got that little trumpet.

307
00:18:54,946 --> 00:18:55,806
I hope you enjoyed it.

308
00:18:57,406 --> 00:19:00,948
So this was, as far as we profiled it,

309
00:19:01,448 --> 00:19:03,588
what I like to call a do-or-die project.

310
00:19:05,309 --> 00:19:06,669
So what is a do-or-die project?

311
00:19:08,041 --> 00:19:13,063
Deliver on the dates or you proverbially die.

312
00:19:14,423 --> 00:19:17,305
It's a thing that, if you don't meet the conditions,

313
00:19:18,605 --> 00:19:19,065
you're screwed.

314
00:19:20,366 --> 00:19:21,686
There are no good things to happen.

315
00:19:23,107 --> 00:19:25,188
Stakeholders have to be appeased at all times.

316
00:19:25,248 --> 00:19:27,048
So if you've got something,

317
00:19:27,308 --> 00:19:30,029
usually on a high stakes project like this,

318
00:19:30,050 --> 00:19:32,010
a film director has to be appeased,

319
00:19:32,631 --> 00:19:34,151
an exec has to be appeased.

320
00:19:34,551 --> 00:19:36,772
These guys have to be happy at all times, otherwise.

321
00:19:37,403 --> 00:19:44,149
you know it is just bad and it had to fit in a constrained budget so we

322
00:19:44,169 --> 00:19:49,213
couldn't ask for more money you know it was just the way it was so this is how

323
00:19:49,353 --> 00:19:54,497
it tends to feel when you do these kinds of projects so how do you survive these

324
00:19:54,537 --> 00:20:01,082
well you got set realistic goals so for us we had to scope very carefully not

325
00:20:01,403 --> 00:20:05,526
make promises we couldn't keep and if people were

326
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,781
very passionate about a certain idea

327
00:20:08,061 --> 00:20:11,103
that seemed a little too, you know,

328
00:20:11,623 --> 00:20:13,784
not realistic enough, we would have to

329
00:20:14,665 --> 00:20:15,425
shave it down a little bit.

330
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:19,528
However, you also have to stay flexible.

331
00:20:19,948 --> 00:20:24,451
So it's very easy when you're running against the clock

332
00:20:25,011 --> 00:20:26,372
to just quickly say no to things,

333
00:20:26,872 --> 00:20:28,413
and it feels safe, and it feels like

334
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:30,074
you're protecting the team, and all that kind of stuff.

335
00:20:30,915 --> 00:20:34,277
But sometimes you've got to just center yourself

336
00:20:34,357 --> 00:20:35,077
and go, all right.

337
00:20:36,348 --> 00:20:37,468
there's this thing someone wants.

338
00:20:38,329 --> 00:20:40,230
My first instinct is to say no.

339
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:43,931
What is another solution instead?

340
00:20:44,491 --> 00:20:45,892
So you're not saying no,

341
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:49,554
you're figuring out how to solve the problem creatively.

342
00:20:50,434 --> 00:20:53,455
Which is difficult to do when you've got a do or die project.

343
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:58,438
And yeah, figuring out when to say no.

344
00:21:00,739 --> 00:21:02,819
The things that are most impactful are usually features.

345
00:21:03,020 --> 00:21:04,820
I mean, that's easy, you all know that.

346
00:21:06,184 --> 00:21:10,767
So it's just really identifying when those things are.

347
00:21:12,969 --> 00:21:13,629
So here was the brief.

348
00:21:15,370 --> 00:21:18,333
It had to work for first time VR users.

349
00:21:18,353 --> 00:21:21,094
It had to be intuitive, nothing crazy to learn,

350
00:21:21,134 --> 00:21:23,556
nothing overly complicated.

351
00:21:23,856 --> 00:21:25,858
You could give it to your grandma, she could figure it out.

352
00:21:26,999 --> 00:21:30,721
It had to be on Vive, Oculus, and PSVR, same day.

353
00:21:32,042 --> 00:21:34,784
It had to have realistic visuals or, you know,

354
00:21:35,369 --> 00:21:40,271
realistic in game world, so I guess high definition of visuals.

355
00:21:41,591 --> 00:21:49,073
It had to live in a, like an arcade cabinet equivalent in cinemas a month before the movie

356
00:21:49,113 --> 00:21:56,736
released. So this one we learned kind of a week into agreeing to the project and then we sort of

357
00:21:56,756 --> 00:22:03,418
had to, you know, figure it out real quickly. And for the live version we had to have a three minute

358
00:22:05,157 --> 00:22:07,840
kind of trimmed version because of the throughput.

359
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:09,781
Because it was a marketing piece for the movie,

360
00:22:10,461 --> 00:22:14,004
we had to consider that aspect very carefully.

361
00:22:15,585 --> 00:22:18,287
And we couldn't have vomit-inducing motion.

362
00:22:18,628 --> 00:22:20,749
So, you're talking about Spider-Man,

363
00:22:21,310 --> 00:22:22,551
the first thing you think is I'm gonna be

364
00:22:22,591 --> 00:22:24,812
swinging through the city, probably be, you know,

365
00:22:25,253 --> 00:22:27,274
our first idea was we're gonna do an infinite runner

366
00:22:27,314 --> 00:22:29,896
with swinging through the city in VR.

367
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:32,898
And everything we saw about trying to accomplish that,

368
00:22:33,493 --> 00:22:35,695
led to, you're probably gonna vomit.

369
00:22:36,175 --> 00:22:39,878
So, yeah, the marketing team were not happy about that.

370
00:22:42,781 --> 00:22:46,103
So, we had to identify what were our targets.

371
00:22:46,984 --> 00:22:49,386
So, first time VR users.

372
00:22:52,229 --> 00:22:53,610
Must direct the user quickly.

373
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:56,412
We had to limit discovery based progression

374
00:22:56,452 --> 00:22:57,233
and level design.

375
00:22:57,813 --> 00:23:00,075
So, none of that, here you're in a room

376
00:23:00,135 --> 00:23:01,096
and there's nothing else,

377
00:23:01,176 --> 00:23:02,437
and oh, what do I do with that thing?

378
00:23:03,082 --> 00:23:06,384
we pretty much had to tell the user what to do beat for beat.

379
00:23:08,325 --> 00:23:12,847
And this was, again, to satisfy the person's grandma who's

380
00:23:12,907 --> 00:23:14,908
a Spider-Man fan, wants to play it, and just figure it out.

381
00:23:16,489 --> 00:23:18,470
Trying to get on all three of those platforms

382
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:19,410
is a bit of a challenge.

383
00:23:20,570 --> 00:23:23,032
So we just targeted the PSVR, because that's

384
00:23:23,092 --> 00:23:24,072
the lowest spec one.

385
00:23:25,573 --> 00:23:28,874
But the realistic aspect was a bit of a challenge,

386
00:23:28,934 --> 00:23:30,655
because at the time.

387
00:23:31,270 --> 00:23:34,951
Substance Designer and Unreal 4 shipping to PSPR,

388
00:23:34,991 --> 00:23:36,692
there was some compatibility issue

389
00:23:36,752 --> 00:23:39,794
where all our substance textures just didn't work.

390
00:23:40,094 --> 00:23:41,074
It just crashed the build.

391
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:43,035
So we had to go back,

392
00:23:44,516 --> 00:23:47,097
gut all the substances, export the textures,

393
00:23:47,697 --> 00:23:51,399
and then shove those textures into Unreal's shader model

394
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:52,840
and do it that way.

395
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,261
So we lost time from that, but you know.

396
00:23:56,901 --> 00:23:59,042
And for the arcade release, or sorry,

397
00:23:59,282 --> 00:23:59,983
tour deployment.

398
00:24:01,524 --> 00:24:06,769
we had to shave from five months development time to four,

399
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:09,352
which was a little scarier,

400
00:24:10,012 --> 00:24:13,656
and we had to sort of let the QA cycle get hit,

401
00:24:14,396 --> 00:24:16,678
which, you know, for a short experience

402
00:24:16,719 --> 00:24:17,679
actually isn't that scary,

403
00:24:19,001 --> 00:24:20,802
but you know, when planning things out,

404
00:24:20,842 --> 00:24:24,366
we were concerned for reasons you will see shortly.

405
00:24:27,022 --> 00:24:29,183
If the player took, so for the arcade deployment

406
00:24:29,203 --> 00:24:30,544
for that three minute time frame,

407
00:24:31,185 --> 00:24:34,787
we had to build in a mechanic to push the player forward.

408
00:24:35,268 --> 00:24:37,389
So if they stood around too long doing nothing,

409
00:24:38,029 --> 00:24:43,393
we had to either move on to the next task

410
00:24:44,134 --> 00:24:46,355
or teleport them to the location that they had to be.

411
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:50,638
Thankfully, not many people dealt

412
00:24:50,719 --> 00:24:52,700
with the teleporting side of things,

413
00:24:53,420 --> 00:24:54,881
because it felt very unnatural.

414
00:24:56,364 --> 00:25:02,128
But that was the only solution we could come up with at the time that we could execute.

415
00:25:02,389 --> 00:25:05,431
And yeah, for the vomiting, no freeform swinging.

416
00:25:08,012 --> 00:25:12,756
Because we just didn't have a design solution that we knew would prevent people getting nauseous.

417
00:25:14,637 --> 00:25:17,319
And we couldn't take the time to do the R&D for it.

418
00:25:18,860 --> 00:25:25,324
And yeah, no swinging, focus on web skills, physics gameplay, no frame drops, or 90 frames a second.

419
00:25:26,390 --> 00:25:27,130
we were pretty scared.

420
00:25:28,491 --> 00:25:32,032
So we just shrugged and tried to figure it out

421
00:25:32,052 --> 00:25:32,572
and got to work.

422
00:25:33,713 --> 00:25:34,573
So what do we propose?

423
00:25:36,494 --> 00:25:38,655
Okay, you'll have to forgive me, this text is very tiny.

424
00:25:45,217 --> 00:25:47,318
The suit, it's very small.

425
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:53,940
You know what, I'll crack my neck a bit, hold on.

426
00:25:54,841 --> 00:25:55,121
All right.

427
00:25:55,666 --> 00:25:59,309
So the suit is one of the things in the movie that's really special, right?

428
00:25:59,389 --> 00:26:03,973
So Spidey, he's really known for his special powers and so on,

429
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:05,854
but in the movie, the suit was like this big,

430
00:26:05,914 --> 00:26:07,115
ooh, he's got a fancy suit.

431
00:26:07,676 --> 00:26:08,516
It was all high-tech.

432
00:26:09,097 --> 00:26:12,119
So we sold the idea of what if

433
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,202
we sell the entire piece about,

434
00:26:16,242 --> 00:26:18,544
hey, you get to try Spidey's new high-tech suit

435
00:26:18,584 --> 00:26:19,725
that Iron Man built for him.

436
00:26:20,406 --> 00:26:23,308
So that was how we packaged the piece.

437
00:26:25,100 --> 00:26:26,561
but there was one snag.

438
00:26:27,601 --> 00:26:29,882
The client wanted a mirror scene,

439
00:26:29,922 --> 00:26:31,803
like in the Batman VR experience.

440
00:26:32,824 --> 00:26:35,805
And a mirror scene means you have to build a full,

441
00:26:36,625 --> 00:26:38,486
you know, upper body rig at least.

442
00:26:39,066 --> 00:26:40,627
And that meant inverse kinematics.

443
00:26:41,487 --> 00:26:43,228
And we were a little bit worried about that.

444
00:26:43,988 --> 00:26:45,869
So that was a thing.

445
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:49,211
And then the next bit was,

446
00:26:49,231 --> 00:26:51,252
because we're not having swinging, what are we gonna do?

447
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:55,530
What can we do to make this feel like a Spider-Man experience?

448
00:26:56,191 --> 00:26:59,514
So we went with web types, playing around with this web shooter,

449
00:27:00,314 --> 00:27:03,537
slinging things, throwing things, shooting things with webs,

450
00:27:04,017 --> 00:27:04,578
that kind of thing.

451
00:27:05,959 --> 00:27:08,281
So then physics came into play.

452
00:27:09,242 --> 00:27:12,985
And we weren't allowed, when we proposed that we wanted to do something

453
00:27:13,005 --> 00:27:16,608
kind of gamey with like AR targets, that didn't fly.

454
00:27:17,068 --> 00:27:20,992
So we then had to go with real world props on a rooftop.

455
00:27:22,184 --> 00:27:24,845
in Queens, in a realistic art style.

456
00:27:24,885 --> 00:27:27,727
So all of this stuff was getting more and more scary.

457
00:27:29,428 --> 00:27:30,988
We asked if we could set it in Manhattan,

458
00:27:31,789 --> 00:27:34,270
because we could use big buildings to limit draw distance.

459
00:27:35,991 --> 00:27:38,252
But that was shot down and we were asked to put it in Queens

460
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:41,873
and Queens, if you've never been to New York, is a bit flat.

461
00:27:42,614 --> 00:27:45,835
So if you're high up, you can see everything.

462
00:27:47,276 --> 00:27:49,417
So that was another, oh God,

463
00:27:49,497 --> 00:27:51,238
how are we gonna deliver this moment?

464
00:27:54,083 --> 00:27:58,824
And because it's a marketing piece, we had to feature a major character in the movie that wasn't just Spidey.

465
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:07,927
Initially, we were given the go-ahead to put Iron Man in there, which was kind of exciting, you know, because we're all Marvel nerds back at the office.

466
00:28:10,268 --> 00:28:19,531
But, a little bit of the ways into the project, there was a publicized legal hurdle.

467
00:28:20,191 --> 00:28:21,852
And we couldn't use Iron Man anymore,

468
00:28:22,072 --> 00:28:23,633
so we'd scope for Iron Man,

469
00:28:24,113 --> 00:28:25,654
and we'd scope for this final moment

470
00:28:25,674 --> 00:28:27,615
where you swing out alongside Iron Man,

471
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:30,797
like best friends, and you know, title card and all that,

472
00:28:31,157 --> 00:28:31,897
and we had to scrap it.

473
00:28:32,918 --> 00:28:35,379
And the only other character in the movie

474
00:28:35,519 --> 00:28:37,240
that's a big enough character was Vulture.

475
00:28:37,860 --> 00:28:40,382
So then you got the villain of the piece showing up,

476
00:28:40,822 --> 00:28:44,044
you got Spidey, you can't fly away with the villain

477
00:28:44,264 --> 00:28:45,464
like he's your best mate.

478
00:28:46,705 --> 00:28:47,225
What do we do?

479
00:28:48,419 --> 00:28:51,319
So we had to then scope this whole extra section that was

480
00:28:51,659 --> 00:28:54,580
a dramatic moment for the player, you know, as fighting

481
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:56,320
which you'll see in a bit.

482
00:28:59,381 --> 00:29:02,342
And the swinging, we couldn't do it without one swing or two

483
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:03,982
you know, it just felt wrong.

484
00:29:05,923 --> 00:29:08,483
So our compromise was instead of free-form swinging

485
00:29:09,023 --> 00:29:12,824
and having the latches off the safety for, you know, player comfort and all that

486
00:29:13,905 --> 00:29:16,985
we directed two specific swing moments.

487
00:29:18,088 --> 00:29:20,709
And that seemed to work because in VR,

488
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:24,412
people will not tolerate extended nausea,

489
00:29:24,532 --> 00:29:26,353
but one or two shots and that's it,

490
00:29:26,893 --> 00:29:27,954
you can sort of get away with.

491
00:29:27,994 --> 00:29:31,176
It's not advised, but we didn't get any complaints,

492
00:29:31,216 --> 00:29:33,118
thankfully.

493
00:29:34,238 --> 00:29:36,020
And yeah, the arcade tour build thing,

494
00:29:36,060 --> 00:29:39,782
because that sort of hit us a few weeks in

495
00:29:39,862 --> 00:29:40,943
on a very short project,

496
00:29:42,684 --> 00:29:44,225
the compromise that we offered was,

497
00:29:44,265 --> 00:29:47,207
hey, why don't we make it beta level quality?

498
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,614
In hindsight, as we started rolling through,

499
00:29:51,674 --> 00:29:55,136
we realized we couldn't ship beta quality code

500
00:29:55,916 --> 00:30:00,479
to a marketing level piece on a worldwide tour

501
00:30:00,599 --> 00:30:01,980
to promote a massive film.

502
00:30:03,021 --> 00:30:07,884
So, we sort of face palmed for a few moments

503
00:30:08,284 --> 00:30:10,405
and then realized we had to scope

504
00:30:10,445 --> 00:30:14,427
a couple of polish features out,

505
00:30:15,128 --> 00:30:16,969
you know, which is as you do.

506
00:30:17,849 --> 00:30:18,090
So.

507
00:30:19,902 --> 00:30:23,303
The high level, physics, massive draw distance,

508
00:30:23,803 --> 00:30:27,244
IK, in VR, 90 frames a second with no drops,

509
00:30:27,884 --> 00:30:31,665
realistic-ish art style, four months development cycle,

510
00:30:32,285 --> 00:30:33,305
no additions to budget.

511
00:30:35,626 --> 00:30:38,006
So, yeah.

512
00:30:38,726 --> 00:30:40,067
This was us in the studio,

513
00:30:40,887 --> 00:30:42,127
trying to figure out how to do this.

514
00:30:44,147 --> 00:30:46,268
Here's a previz of what we put together.

515
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:48,788
So this was within the first two weeks.

516
00:30:50,206 --> 00:30:59,431
Because feedback loops are really difficult in movie client-based relationships,

517
00:31:00,532 --> 00:31:02,833
we had to come up with something that could get approved really quickly.

518
00:31:03,153 --> 00:31:08,756
So we put together a Previs, which is something very useful for film people.

519
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:11,257
They use it regularly.

520
00:31:34,557 --> 00:31:38,100
Hello, Peter. This is your new suit. Please put on the mask.

521
00:31:42,343 --> 00:31:47,487
Welcome to your SM-3000 suit. I'm here to explain your suit's capabilities.

522
00:31:51,070 --> 00:31:54,052
Please review your appearance in the reflective surface to your left.

523
00:32:00,878 --> 00:32:02,359
Initiating your new web shooter.

524
00:32:03,260 --> 00:32:07,382
Rapid fire mode. Press and hold your trigger to shoot a steady stream of webbing.

525
00:32:14,064 --> 00:32:18,406
Based on your performance, you are awarded a B. Please remember to train harder.

526
00:32:21,507 --> 00:32:26,389
Initiating web sling. Beginner mode. Press and hold your shooter to tether objects to the web.

527
00:32:32,546 --> 00:32:36,470
Initiating web bomb mode. Please hold the trigger to charge a larger bomb.

528
00:32:48,563 --> 00:32:52,788
A unique energy reading is coming from your location. Please get to a higher viewpoint.

529
00:33:12,165 --> 00:33:16,028
You have no idea what you're getting yourself into.

530
00:33:16,048 --> 00:33:17,389
Structural integrity failing.

531
00:33:17,989 --> 00:33:19,611
Your webbing is strong enough to repair.

532
00:33:25,175 --> 00:33:26,215
Back off!

533
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:37,824
So yeah, that was pretty much it.

534
00:33:45,959 --> 00:33:49,282
And as you can tell, some of those pictures were from other games.

535
00:33:51,143 --> 00:33:53,325
And the voices were from people who worked with us.

536
00:33:54,006 --> 00:33:58,750
But yeah, we needed something that the film guys could resonate with quickly and Previs

537
00:33:59,151 --> 00:34:04,856
is a pitching technique that the movie studios use that actually saved our asses.

538
00:34:06,304 --> 00:34:08,385
From that, they were able to very quickly tell us,

539
00:34:08,925 --> 00:34:12,686
even though that Manhattan setup looks kind of nice and atmospheric,

540
00:34:12,946 --> 00:34:15,187
we don't want it, it has to be Queens, blah, blah, blah.

541
00:34:15,607 --> 00:34:19,428
But we were able to knuckle down and figure something out straight away.

542
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:21,609
So how did it all go?

543
00:34:23,590 --> 00:34:28,391
We shipped it, everything worked out, got it on time, all our targets landed,

544
00:34:29,491 --> 00:34:33,573
nobody died, thankfully, and we all got drunk after.

545
00:34:34,841 --> 00:34:38,124
The only things we really lost in development,

546
00:34:39,105 --> 00:34:41,707
which was just part of the decision-making process really,

547
00:34:42,468 --> 00:34:44,870
was we lost full-body IK.

548
00:34:44,990 --> 00:34:48,733
So originally, we wanted Spidey to have a full-body presence

549
00:34:49,594 --> 00:34:51,276
and one of the issues that we found,

550
00:34:52,016 --> 00:34:53,998
and I'm sorry I don't have a gif about this,

551
00:34:54,118 --> 00:34:56,781
I wish I did, you'd look down

552
00:34:57,081 --> 00:34:59,523
and we just didn't have the R&D time.

553
00:35:00,534 --> 00:35:04,235
in the pipeline to have someone work out when feet go janky.

554
00:35:05,256 --> 00:35:10,598
Because full body IK, you've got to sort of approximate where the feet are going to be.

555
00:35:12,419 --> 00:35:18,342
And we had some ideas like if you mount the controller pivot sort of to the head,

556
00:35:19,062 --> 00:35:21,423
and if the head moves, then the body sort of does this.

557
00:35:22,043 --> 00:35:25,685
But we didn't have time to prototype that,

558
00:35:25,705 --> 00:35:29,506
but in hindsight it felt like it might sort of be weird and tanky.

559
00:35:30,490 --> 00:35:31,791
Yeah, so screw it.

560
00:35:31,831 --> 00:35:34,873
We just did upper body, and if you look down at your body,

561
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,114
it's pretty much just hands.

562
00:35:37,636 --> 00:35:39,317
And the only other thing we lost

563
00:35:39,357 --> 00:35:41,519
was this sort of depth feature we had

564
00:35:41,579 --> 00:35:42,580
where you look at things,

565
00:35:43,521 --> 00:35:46,163
and you'd get a little readout on the AR reader.

566
00:35:47,204 --> 00:35:48,825
But that never happened, so whatever.

567
00:35:50,206 --> 00:35:52,288
So here's some screenshots of what it ended up looking like.

568
00:35:53,049 --> 00:35:54,169
This was the suit in the case,

569
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:55,851
which didn't fly in in the end

570
00:35:56,111 --> 00:35:59,534
because Marvel felt that was off-brand.

571
00:36:00,109 --> 00:36:03,010
So you just show up on the roof and there's your case

572
00:36:03,571 --> 00:36:04,492
and there's the spidey thing.

573
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:09,875
This is a reflection scene, so at the player level

574
00:36:09,915 --> 00:36:12,877
you just got the wrists, but the IK body,

575
00:36:13,418 --> 00:36:15,279
because we were having some runtime issues with it,

576
00:36:15,919 --> 00:36:18,141
we just isolated it to where you'd only see it

577
00:36:18,201 --> 00:36:18,801
in the reflection.

578
00:36:19,782 --> 00:36:23,845
And this scene for the frame rate

579
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,747
was actually pretty stressed.

580
00:36:27,347 --> 00:36:29,128
So that's why we opted to go with that as well.

581
00:36:31,995 --> 00:36:34,315
The physics playground stuff kind of worked out.

582
00:36:34,696 --> 00:36:40,617
It's a little weird up there because there's tires and why the hell are there tires on a roof?

583
00:36:41,238 --> 00:36:46,639
We could sort of excuse the construction spool and we had lots of balloons there to add color.

584
00:36:47,399 --> 00:36:54,061
That was also excused because it's Peter celebrating him getting a fancy new suit that can do fancy gadgety things.

585
00:36:55,222 --> 00:36:58,503
This was the first controlled web sling.

586
00:36:59,171 --> 00:37:03,333
So you can sort of repel yourself up to the crane at a certain point in the experience.

587
00:37:03,913 --> 00:37:06,974
And a lot of people get a little bit weird with it.

588
00:37:08,335 --> 00:37:11,396
This scene is when you're looking down from the crane.

589
00:37:12,056 --> 00:37:17,378
And one of the things I enjoyed the most is that I'd have friends over who play a lot of games,

590
00:37:18,299 --> 00:37:20,660
and at this scene they would take off the helmet and go, nah, fuck off.

591
00:37:23,841 --> 00:37:24,241
LAUGHTER

592
00:37:24,261 --> 00:37:25,502
Yeah, it was a lot of fun seeing that.

593
00:37:25,602 --> 00:37:28,123
And funnily enough, people who didn't play games...

594
00:37:29,152 --> 00:37:33,356
loved it out there, they didn't give a shit, but most people who played games were put

595
00:37:33,476 --> 00:37:36,318
in the headset for this, just yeah, they couldn't do it.

596
00:37:38,739 --> 00:37:41,381
So how did we get it all done? Alright, so

597
00:37:42,582 --> 00:37:45,725
the stakeholders, you know, thinking about our audience

598
00:37:46,165 --> 00:37:49,908
in terms of the client, we knew

599
00:37:50,448 --> 00:37:52,430
I mean the company who built this

600
00:37:53,851 --> 00:37:58,034
are born of a movie trailer house, so they understood the movie culture very

601
00:37:58,114 --> 00:37:58,274
well.

602
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:01,222
My role there was to help understand how to make games.

603
00:38:01,542 --> 00:38:04,463
So using that knowledge, we built a Previs,

604
00:38:04,703 --> 00:38:09,225
that worked great, and yeah, everybody was happy.

605
00:38:10,065 --> 00:38:11,325
One of the things we had to do

606
00:38:11,685 --> 00:38:14,867
because our development was somewhat,

607
00:38:15,887 --> 00:38:17,828
I wouldn't say hampered, but could have been hampered

608
00:38:17,908 --> 00:38:21,249
by VFX assets that we needed to build everything.

609
00:38:22,489 --> 00:38:25,310
So for example, Vulture and Spidey were built from,

610
00:38:25,750 --> 00:38:27,491
built down from VFX rigs.

611
00:38:28,082 --> 00:38:31,024
which are usually these multi-million poly beasts

612
00:38:31,685 --> 00:38:34,547
with many boned rigs

613
00:38:36,488 --> 00:38:39,411
and texture technology called UDIMs,

614
00:38:39,871 --> 00:38:43,654
which is basically multiple atlases within an atlas

615
00:38:44,394 --> 00:38:45,055
and it's absurd.

616
00:38:45,235 --> 00:38:46,736
Like you just can't put that in a game engine.

617
00:38:47,317 --> 00:38:52,340
So we needed to set targets for the film people

618
00:38:53,255 --> 00:38:55,357
so that we could then deliver what we needed to do.

619
00:38:55,417 --> 00:38:57,558
So if we didn't get, say, the vulture asset

620
00:38:57,578 --> 00:38:59,780
in a certain time, we'd have a modeler,

621
00:39:00,260 --> 00:39:02,222
you know, have to build him from scratch on reference.

622
00:39:04,283 --> 00:39:06,064
The only time that that,

623
00:39:07,245 --> 00:39:08,386
I mean, I wouldn't say it failed us,

624
00:39:08,406 --> 00:39:09,547
because we got through it,

625
00:39:09,627 --> 00:39:10,948
but the only time it didn't work out

626
00:39:10,988 --> 00:39:14,130
was with the UI on Spidey's wrists.

627
00:39:14,590 --> 00:39:16,992
Because in the movie, it's this crazy thing that,

628
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:20,474
if you imagine the weapon wheel from Ratchet and Clank,

629
00:39:20,912 --> 00:39:23,053
where it's got like the eight little dudes on it,

630
00:39:23,073 --> 00:39:23,934
the little icons.

631
00:39:24,774 --> 00:39:27,276
This is like a 50 icon weapon wheel.

632
00:39:27,736 --> 00:39:29,117
So yeah, obviously we weren't gonna have that.

633
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:33,741
And yeah, we work close with the client

634
00:39:33,761 --> 00:39:34,681
to balance things out.

635
00:39:34,781 --> 00:39:37,063
So they kept asking for things

636
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:39,225
because they wanted this thing to be the best thing

637
00:39:39,565 --> 00:39:40,105
that it could be.

638
00:39:40,626 --> 00:39:42,927
And you know, their world is asking for things

639
00:39:42,947 --> 00:39:43,828
all the time and getting them.

640
00:39:44,849 --> 00:39:46,210
And we would have a negotiation.

641
00:39:46,310 --> 00:39:47,691
We would say, okay, you want this,

642
00:39:48,111 --> 00:39:48,952
this is what it's gonna take.

643
00:39:49,548 --> 00:39:53,910
take from the project, we can give you this thing instead,

644
00:39:54,631 --> 00:39:55,751
or we can give you this thing

645
00:39:55,851 --> 00:39:57,132
if we take this other thing away.

646
00:39:58,052 --> 00:40:01,594
So it didn't become a no, it just became an exchange,

647
00:40:01,654 --> 00:40:03,334
a constant discussion, and it worked out.

648
00:40:04,415 --> 00:40:06,556
When we really couldn't do anything,

649
00:40:06,876 --> 00:40:09,157
we would tell them, look, we really can't do this,

650
00:40:09,397 --> 00:40:10,978
and they would try and support us as best they can.

651
00:40:13,379 --> 00:40:14,919
But yeah, the most important thing,

652
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:18,561
it really was the right people.

653
00:40:19,140 --> 00:40:20,981
And I know that sounds like a tight cliche,

654
00:40:21,121 --> 00:40:25,143
but never before have I felt it be true than on this project.

655
00:40:26,363 --> 00:40:28,104
We made sure that we picked people

656
00:40:28,524 --> 00:40:30,845
who had the right mentality

657
00:40:31,485 --> 00:40:35,707
to deal with a constant deluge of change and stress

658
00:40:35,907 --> 00:40:37,708
and things that you would normally

659
00:40:39,869 --> 00:40:41,370
kinda look at in a list and go,

660
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:42,751
yeah, I'm not gonna do that.

661
00:40:42,951 --> 00:40:44,972
That's not gonna happen.

662
00:40:46,372 --> 00:40:48,633
So, everybody on the team.

663
00:40:49,127 --> 00:40:51,908
had a problem solver attitude and it went a really long way.

664
00:40:53,408 --> 00:40:55,709
People who had reductive thinking

665
00:40:56,489 --> 00:40:58,010
tended to be more stressed out.

666
00:40:59,050 --> 00:40:59,870
They seemed to be,

667
00:41:01,911 --> 00:41:03,591
they couldn't deliver anything

668
00:41:03,791 --> 00:41:05,592
beyond the thing on the piece of paper

669
00:41:05,752 --> 00:41:07,693
because their brains, the way,

670
00:41:07,713 --> 00:41:10,214
I guess their outlook, their philosophy

671
00:41:10,294 --> 00:41:14,255
on how to tackle these moments was holding them back.

672
00:41:15,275 --> 00:41:15,435
And

673
00:41:16,728 --> 00:41:18,449
You know, I feel bad for him,

674
00:41:18,689 --> 00:41:20,371
and I've caught myself in that mentality,

675
00:41:20,411 --> 00:41:23,433
so, you know, like I can be sympathetic to it.

676
00:41:24,895 --> 00:41:26,316
Yeah, that mentality is just a killer.

677
00:41:26,756 --> 00:41:29,919
Like you really need to be in a problem solver mentality

678
00:41:29,999 --> 00:41:34,102
to get through a project like this, and do a good job.

679
00:41:34,602 --> 00:41:36,464
You know, if you get into that reductive place

680
00:41:36,484 --> 00:41:38,966
where it's like, wah, I agree to this, you know,

681
00:41:39,647 --> 00:41:41,028
I'm not gonna go beyond this line,

682
00:41:41,068 --> 00:41:41,969
or any of that kind of stuff,

683
00:41:44,050 --> 00:41:44,851
you're not gonna get through it.

684
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:46,432
Yeah.

685
00:41:46,923 --> 00:41:49,804
So, but we agreed to this, all that kind of stuff.

686
00:41:49,984 --> 00:41:51,484
It's indicative of a mentality

687
00:41:51,584 --> 00:41:53,065
that isn't about solving a problem,

688
00:41:53,125 --> 00:41:54,305
it's about protecting yourself.

689
00:41:55,105 --> 00:41:57,546
And that's a very understandable place to come from.

690
00:41:58,246 --> 00:42:00,667
But you gotta think about how do I solve the problem,

691
00:42:01,327 --> 00:42:03,867
not how do I protect myself necessarily.

692
00:42:03,967 --> 00:42:05,408
I mean, obviously there's a line there.

693
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:08,128
But when you're thinking about building something,

694
00:42:08,568 --> 00:42:11,189
start with solving the problem and then figure out,

695
00:42:11,569 --> 00:42:14,610
okay, am I doing this?

696
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:17,081
in a way that's constructive for everyone,

697
00:42:17,121 --> 00:42:18,142
not just constructive for me.

698
00:42:19,523 --> 00:42:22,726
And yeah, that's what I ended up taking away

699
00:42:22,766 --> 00:42:24,768
from this the most.

700
00:42:25,428 --> 00:42:26,929
Yeah, and that was it.

701
00:42:27,350 --> 00:42:27,390
So.

702
00:42:27,410 --> 00:42:27,550
So.

703
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:34,516
So.

704
00:42:34,536 --> 00:42:34,656
So.

705
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:34,716
So.

706
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:34,776
So.

707
00:42:34,796 --> 00:42:34,876
So.

708
00:42:34,916 --> 00:42:34,956
So.

709
00:42:34,976 --> 00:42:35,136
So.

710
00:42:35,156 --> 00:42:36,337
So.

711
00:42:36,597 --> 00:42:36,637
So.

712
00:42:36,958 --> 00:42:37,058
So.

713
00:42:37,138 --> 00:42:37,178
So.

714
00:42:37,218 --> 00:42:37,338
So.

715
00:42:37,358 --> 00:42:37,398
So.

716
00:42:38,539 --> 00:42:38,639
So.

717
00:42:38,659 --> 00:42:38,699
So.

718
00:42:38,719 --> 00:42:38,759
So.

719
00:42:38,839 --> 00:42:38,899
So.

720
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:38,959
So.

721
00:42:38,979 --> 00:42:39,079
So.

722
00:42:39,099 --> 00:42:39,159
So.

723
00:42:45,561 --> 00:42:47,602
because we're running low on time.

724
00:42:47,662 --> 00:42:49,423
So here we go, right into it.

725
00:42:49,963 --> 00:42:54,525
Cinemora was a video game that came out in 2012.

726
00:42:56,686 --> 00:42:58,327
It was originally planned for arcades,

727
00:42:58,407 --> 00:43:01,609
but it wound up getting released on Xbox 360,

728
00:43:01,709 --> 00:43:03,549
Windows, PS3, and Vita.

729
00:43:04,330 --> 00:43:06,791
It was a collaboration between the Hungarian developer,

730
00:43:06,851 --> 00:43:09,812
Digital Reality, and the Japanese developer,

731
00:43:09,852 --> 00:43:11,553
Grasshopper Manufacture, who you may know

732
00:43:11,673 --> 00:43:14,595
from Killer7, No More Heroes, and Stuff.

733
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:16,841
All the code and design and story,

734
00:43:17,301 --> 00:43:19,642
and most of the art was done in Hungary,

735
00:43:20,442 --> 00:43:23,004
and a little bit of the art, like concept stuff,

736
00:43:23,204 --> 00:43:25,565
and all the music and sound stuff was done in Japan.

737
00:43:26,726 --> 00:43:27,626
So five years later,

738
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:31,348
Cinnamora EX, an upgraded version,

739
00:43:31,508 --> 00:43:34,830
was released on Windows, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch,

740
00:43:34,950 --> 00:43:36,251
and I'm basically gonna talk about

741
00:43:36,331 --> 00:43:38,992
how we got from the first one to the second one,

742
00:43:39,632 --> 00:43:43,555
and what we did along the way.

743
00:43:43,575 --> 00:43:43,755
All right.

744
00:43:44,124 --> 00:43:46,865
So, it's a side-scrolling shooter.

745
00:43:47,285 --> 00:43:48,246
It looks really nice.

746
00:43:48,266 --> 00:43:50,568
It's got really good music by Akira Yamaoka.

747
00:43:50,748 --> 00:43:51,888
Just imagine all that stuff.

748
00:43:52,729 --> 00:43:55,050
On the original game, I naturalized all of the text.

749
00:43:55,230 --> 00:43:59,413
And naturalizing means, basically, I took the original stuff

750
00:43:59,753 --> 00:44:03,155
that was written in Hungarian, and I rewrote all of it

751
00:44:03,215 --> 00:44:05,637
so that it would appear to have been written in English the first time.

752
00:44:06,537 --> 00:44:08,519
The story was pretty challenging,

753
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:11,180
because it was very complicated and convoluted

754
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,222
and high-concept sci-fi stuff.

755
00:44:13,742 --> 00:44:16,564
and it was constantly calling back to itself

756
00:44:17,244 --> 00:44:20,206
and referring to things that happened earlier

757
00:44:20,306 --> 00:44:21,407
or doing things out of order.

758
00:44:22,007 --> 00:44:25,609
And in a shooter, like a scrolling shooter

759
00:44:25,649 --> 00:44:27,650
where you're supposed to be doing twitchy action,

760
00:44:28,210 --> 00:44:32,433
it's a tough sell, and there's about 10,000 words

761
00:44:32,833 --> 00:44:35,094
for this shooting game, maybe the most

762
00:44:35,454 --> 00:44:37,095
in any shooting game that I can think of.

763
00:44:37,876 --> 00:44:39,557
So it was an interesting project,

764
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,258
and I had to translate an ancient poem.

765
00:44:43,177 --> 00:44:44,458
That's what you see in the middle there.

766
00:44:45,558 --> 00:44:48,200
It was part of the poem, In the Sieve of Time.

767
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:51,403
This game has a, as part of its core mechanic,

768
00:44:52,283 --> 00:44:56,126
it has a time rewind system because it's,

769
00:44:56,967 --> 00:45:01,170
the protagonists are a group of humanoids

770
00:45:01,350 --> 00:45:04,632
who can control time, basically,

771
00:45:04,652 --> 00:45:06,133
and they're being hunted to extinction

772
00:45:06,353 --> 00:45:08,375
by regular human beings.

773
00:45:09,376 --> 00:45:10,316
So it was very important to them

774
00:45:10,356 --> 00:45:11,437
that they get this poem in there.

775
00:45:11,887 --> 00:45:15,409
But this poem is 100 years old and has never been translated.

776
00:45:15,869 --> 00:45:17,991
It's by this guy whose name I can't pronounce

777
00:45:18,011 --> 00:45:20,392
because it's Hungarian, which is Endre Adi,

778
00:45:20,452 --> 00:45:21,132
or something like that.

779
00:45:22,233 --> 00:45:24,034
That's him on the left, not on the right.

780
00:45:24,114 --> 00:45:24,934
That's not him.

781
00:45:27,075 --> 00:45:29,977
So in order to do this, I asked for the original Hungarian,

782
00:45:30,597 --> 00:45:32,818
the director's own translation, a list

783
00:45:32,858 --> 00:45:34,920
of things each individual word could mean,

784
00:45:35,640 --> 00:45:38,502
and combined that with a Google Translate.

785
00:45:39,107 --> 00:45:42,570
to kind of put all these elements together to come up with...

786
00:45:43,070 --> 00:45:45,512
Oh, also, I read some of his other poems in English

787
00:45:45,552 --> 00:45:48,235
to kind of try to get an idea of his style.

788
00:45:48,956 --> 00:45:51,238
And really, a PhD should have done this,

789
00:45:51,518 --> 00:45:53,540
but I did it instead, so sorry.

790
00:45:58,164 --> 00:45:59,845
But it was kind of cool to be able to be like,

791
00:45:59,885 --> 00:46:02,528
yeah, in this game, I translated a poem

792
00:46:02,648 --> 00:46:06,051
from Hungary's most famous poet for the first time ever.

793
00:46:07,411 --> 00:46:13,735
So then, Cinemora EX was announced, and I found out about this by watching Nintendo Direct.

794
00:46:15,096 --> 00:46:19,960
And I was like, wait a second, I should probably get in on this.

795
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:26,785
So basically there was a lot of stuff that I thought we should fix with the original game that bugged me,

796
00:46:27,345 --> 00:46:34,130
and so I basically tried to bother everyone that I could until I got to someone at THQ Nordic

797
00:46:34,170 --> 00:46:35,131
who was publishing the new...

798
00:46:35,688 --> 00:46:38,790
version of the game and I was like, you have to let me fix things.

799
00:46:39,711 --> 00:46:44,593
And eventually they said, okay, but there were only two months left in the project.

800
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:50,977
So I'm pretty much framing this as a way to look at an existing game, perhaps your game,

801
00:46:51,737 --> 00:46:55,880
and see what's wrong with it, what can be fixed, and giving up on things that you can't

802
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:56,140
fix.

803
00:46:57,641 --> 00:47:00,903
So I'm going to go down some of the things that we did try to fix, because there was

804
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:03,584
a bunch of stuff that we could have fixed.

805
00:47:05,350 --> 00:47:10,333
I originally made a presentation highlighting all of these problems and showed them to the

806
00:47:10,373 --> 00:47:12,934
folks and then we had some back and forth and fixed some stuff.

807
00:47:13,394 --> 00:47:16,556
And one of the biggest issues was hitboxes on backgrounds.

808
00:47:17,276 --> 00:47:22,619
So in this game it's hard to tell kind of what's in the foreground and will kill you

809
00:47:22,659 --> 00:47:26,020
if you run into it and what's in the background and you can just fly right by.

810
00:47:26,561 --> 00:47:30,142
So if you look at the left screenshot here, I've circled this thing, it's kind of hard

811
00:47:30,182 --> 00:47:32,403
to tell what it is, but there's a turret there that you're shooting.

812
00:47:33,337 --> 00:47:36,337
So you can shoot that, which should mean that it's solid,

813
00:47:36,857 --> 00:47:38,738
but if you fly through it, it won't hurt you

814
00:47:38,758 --> 00:47:40,738
because it's actually in the background somehow,

815
00:47:40,838 --> 00:47:43,118
but its hitbox is in the foreground.

816
00:47:44,219 --> 00:47:47,739
Now on the right, there's this train boss that you fight,

817
00:47:48,039 --> 00:47:49,920
and you can shoot all the way through

818
00:47:49,940 --> 00:47:52,100
this part of its body, no problem,

819
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:53,200
but if you touch it, you're dead,

820
00:47:53,960 --> 00:47:54,901
and that's very confusing.

821
00:47:55,941 --> 00:47:57,901
And I found that this is part of a bigger issue

822
00:47:58,461 --> 00:47:59,842
because some of these...

823
00:48:00,533 --> 00:48:08,379
things had their hitboxes extruded many in-game kilometers into the foreground because some

824
00:48:08,439 --> 00:48:15,064
of them were too big or too small, like in the case of parts of a certain boss, they'd

825
00:48:15,084 --> 00:48:18,867
be too big, so they would shrink it down or pull it further away.

826
00:48:19,808 --> 00:48:23,310
Or sometimes they just weren't on the same 2D plane as the ship.

827
00:48:24,371 --> 00:48:25,412
Basically fixing this.

828
00:48:25,930 --> 00:48:27,951
would have meant going through every level

829
00:48:28,432 --> 00:48:31,114
and looking at every hitbox and everything,

830
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:33,136
and it was not gonna happen in two months.

831
00:48:33,696 --> 00:48:38,040
This is also part of why some of the life bars on bosses

832
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:41,223
appear in weird places and start to float away and stuff.

833
00:48:41,623 --> 00:48:43,545
It's because of that distance problem.

834
00:48:44,626 --> 00:48:47,948
So, how could we fix this at all,

835
00:48:48,389 --> 00:48:49,650
given there were two months?

836
00:48:49,910 --> 00:48:52,452
So, the solution that I came up with,

837
00:48:52,833 --> 00:48:54,014
more of a band-aid than anything, was

838
00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,387
Okay, we can't change the background.

839
00:48:58,907 --> 00:49:00,827
Well, what can we change? We can change the ship.

840
00:49:00,847 --> 00:49:02,068
The ship is one thing.

841
00:49:02,668 --> 00:49:04,148
The background is millions of things.

842
00:49:04,829 --> 00:49:08,530
So, you know, we made it so that the ship takes less damage

843
00:49:09,070 --> 00:49:10,870
if it hits something.

844
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:14,431
And so that way, it was less frustrating,

845
00:49:14,531 --> 00:49:18,292
but also less work, because we only had to change one thing

846
00:49:18,832 --> 00:49:20,173
instead of a whole heck bunch.

847
00:49:22,478 --> 00:49:24,939
Talking about the story, it was hard to follow.

848
00:49:25,099 --> 00:49:26,899
That was a common thing among reviewers.

849
00:49:26,939 --> 00:49:28,780
There were some people who really put in the time

850
00:49:28,800 --> 00:49:32,341
that loved it, but generally it's just,

851
00:49:32,741 --> 00:49:34,461
look at all those words, there's a bunch of them.

852
00:49:36,082 --> 00:49:38,962
And there's an A to continue button down there,

853
00:49:38,983 --> 00:49:39,603
there's a lot more.

854
00:49:41,483 --> 00:49:43,044
I would have liked to do a rewrite,

855
00:49:43,644 --> 00:49:45,444
but that would have involved a lot more people

856
00:49:45,544 --> 00:49:48,885
because the original director was not on the remake.

857
00:49:49,742 --> 00:49:53,023
And since I was really only the naturalization person on this project,

858
00:49:53,163 --> 00:49:56,445
though I've written my own scripts for games before,

859
00:49:56,465 --> 00:49:59,426
it would have been a lot more approvals and more complicated.

860
00:49:59,466 --> 00:50:03,607
So instead, THQ decided to record English voices.

861
00:50:04,427 --> 00:50:07,689
Originally, it was in Hungarian, no matter what language you played it in,

862
00:50:07,789 --> 00:50:10,350
Hungarian was the language.

863
00:50:10,390 --> 00:50:14,351
And I thought that was really cool, and I was kind of against this idea.

864
00:50:14,371 --> 00:50:14,431
But...

865
00:50:16,501 --> 00:50:20,844
When they did it, I have to admit that it makes the story easier to follow.

866
00:50:21,864 --> 00:50:26,607
And I think it was because this decision was made by the executive producer Reinhard Polis,

867
00:50:26,727 --> 00:50:30,350
who is not a native English speaker. He's from Austria.

868
00:50:31,030 --> 00:50:36,634
And he mentioned that reading English subtitles is a lot harder and takes a lot more concentration

869
00:50:36,694 --> 00:50:40,816
than listening to people talk. And that makes a lot of sense, especially when you're, like,

870
00:50:40,997 --> 00:50:43,718
swooping through these environments and there's all this stuff going on.

871
00:50:44,179 --> 00:50:45,479
And, like, if you look on the right...

872
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:52,013
you want to look at that big, like, Mithra-style environment thingy.

873
00:50:52,273 --> 00:50:53,914
You don't want to look at those subs on the bottom.

874
00:50:54,414 --> 00:50:56,275
So it was a sensible decision.

875
00:50:58,796 --> 00:51:03,118
Co-op and multiplayer stuff is something that I had nothing to do with.

876
00:51:03,399 --> 00:51:05,139
This was Reinhardt again,

877
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:07,581
but it was a pretty natural addition to the game.

878
00:51:08,361 --> 00:51:12,043
But there were some problems, because this is a single-player narrative.

879
00:51:12,523 --> 00:51:14,964
So how do you have two players in...

880
00:51:15,827 --> 00:51:21,292
that context, because usually you're just one plane flying through, and there will be other

881
00:51:21,332 --> 00:51:26,436
people talking to you, but if there are more planes there that have other personalities than

882
00:51:26,457 --> 00:51:35,524
the game, it completely breaks narrative flow. So they decided on a drone character

883
00:51:35,544 --> 00:51:39,528
that would make a lot of sense, because it's just a robot, doesn't affect the narrative,

884
00:51:39,728 --> 00:51:42,891
and you don't even have to introduce it, really, because

885
00:51:43,647 --> 00:51:47,650
So there's such a long history of shooting games

886
00:51:47,790 --> 00:51:49,171
having a drone ship or something

887
00:51:49,191 --> 00:51:50,472
that you didn't even need to talk about it.

888
00:51:52,774 --> 00:51:54,555
And they made it control differently,

889
00:51:54,595 --> 00:51:55,676
more like a twin stick shooter

890
00:51:55,937 --> 00:51:58,759
to try to kind of make it more interesting.

891
00:51:59,539 --> 00:52:02,962
And Reinhard, who was in charge of this feature,

892
00:52:03,523 --> 00:52:04,523
for him the most important thing

893
00:52:04,563 --> 00:52:05,764
was making sure that you could switch

894
00:52:05,865 --> 00:52:08,967
between both player types.

895
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:12,293
regardless of which player you were at any time,

896
00:52:12,693 --> 00:52:14,174
so that everyone could try out the new mechanics.

897
00:52:15,334 --> 00:52:16,774
Also, there is only one health bar,

898
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,795
which is basically the time.

899
00:52:19,375 --> 00:52:22,256
And so we had to deal with that with two players as well,

900
00:52:22,476 --> 00:52:25,556
and we just basically made both players take damage,

901
00:52:26,556 --> 00:52:28,177
affect the main health bar thing,

902
00:52:29,017 --> 00:52:32,518
but they could also both collect power-ups,

903
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:34,558
and usually in the single-player game,

904
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:35,618
you can't collect all of them,

905
00:52:36,059 --> 00:52:38,479
so it kind of balanced that out quite nicely.

906
00:52:38,798 --> 00:52:41,180
And then mini-games were added as a kind of thing

907
00:52:41,240 --> 00:52:45,362
to solidify multiplayer as a solid addition to this game.

908
00:52:45,382 --> 00:52:48,503
Let me check my time.

909
00:52:49,924 --> 00:52:51,985
Doing okay, I got six minutes.

910
00:52:53,366 --> 00:52:55,087
So there were a lot of tiny details,

911
00:52:55,247 --> 00:52:57,088
like power-ups would spawn on death,

912
00:52:57,608 --> 00:52:59,249
and they spawned forward and away from you.

913
00:52:59,309 --> 00:53:01,009
So if you see on the left there,

914
00:53:02,010 --> 00:53:05,212
those power-ups, when you died, spawned far away from you

915
00:53:05,292 --> 00:53:06,612
and are now behind a boss,

916
00:53:06,672 --> 00:53:07,613
and you can never get them again.

917
00:53:08,302 --> 00:53:09,483
So now they spawn a lot closer.

918
00:53:10,144 --> 00:53:12,065
Bullets are hard to see, especially enemy missiles.

919
00:53:12,125 --> 00:53:13,747
I've circled them over here on the right,

920
00:53:13,787 --> 00:53:15,068
but they're still hard to see.

921
00:53:15,688 --> 00:53:17,029
This is still true, unfortunately.

922
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:20,372
Glow surrounding bullets was bumped up a fair bit,

923
00:53:20,392 --> 00:53:21,613
but there was no time to do more.

924
00:53:21,633 --> 00:53:23,875
And there's way more stuff that we could have done.

925
00:53:25,116 --> 00:53:26,317
Then results.

926
00:53:26,737 --> 00:53:28,719
So Metacritic scores were really interesting.

927
00:53:29,319 --> 00:53:34,023
The press scores went down for the new version on average.

928
00:53:34,543 --> 00:53:37,506
The things that the press said were much nicer than before.

929
00:53:38,154 --> 00:53:39,315
but the scores went down.

930
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:42,077
Metacritic is weird, and the producer and I

931
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,018
were talking about how maybe we should do a talk

932
00:53:44,058 --> 00:53:45,339
about how Metacritic is bullshit.

933
00:53:45,859 --> 00:53:51,143
But the fan scores, the user scores,

934
00:53:51,263 --> 00:53:53,264
went up universally across all platforms.

935
00:53:54,205 --> 00:53:57,247
And I went through and read these reviews

936
00:53:57,267 --> 00:53:58,688
because I was really curious about this,

937
00:53:58,868 --> 00:54:01,010
and I found that fans and reviewers

938
00:54:01,130 --> 00:54:04,572
both liked the changes that we made without realizing it.

939
00:54:05,249 --> 00:54:07,811
There were a lot of things that people complained about before

940
00:54:07,831 --> 00:54:10,894
that just weren't getting complained about or not

941
00:54:10,954 --> 00:54:12,055
complained about as much.

942
00:54:13,015 --> 00:54:17,339
And you could tell that the feeling in general

943
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:22,043
was improved, which was exactly what we wanted to happen.

944
00:54:22,243 --> 00:54:24,345
And frankly, the user score going up is enough.

945
00:54:24,485 --> 00:54:25,986
Also, it sold well, so that's fine.

946
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,367
So what did I learn from this?

947
00:54:28,488 --> 00:54:30,170
I learned to fix what you can.

948
00:54:30,970 --> 00:54:33,511
Fixing things intelligently is incredibly important,

949
00:54:33,551 --> 00:54:35,393
especially with complex projects.

950
00:54:35,733 --> 00:54:38,154
Like we don't, with my own company,

951
00:54:38,375 --> 00:54:39,956
this was a contract for me,

952
00:54:40,236 --> 00:54:42,377
but with my own company, we are constantly doing this.

953
00:54:42,437 --> 00:54:44,699
We've released one of our games called Gun House,

954
00:54:44,979 --> 00:54:47,881
I think seven times on seven different platforms.

955
00:54:47,921 --> 00:54:50,022
And every time we do it, we improve stuff,

956
00:54:50,282 --> 00:54:53,605
we fix the tutorial up more, we fix the menus.

957
00:54:54,125 --> 00:54:56,026
And every time, the game is getting better,

958
00:54:56,266 --> 00:54:59,707
and the general impression of the game improves every time.

959
00:54:59,827 --> 00:55:01,507
And for us, it's been really important.

960
00:55:02,408 --> 00:55:06,169
So I think that your existing games are ripe for remaking

961
00:55:06,269 --> 00:55:08,129
if you want to revisit them.

962
00:55:08,569 --> 00:55:10,510
Cinemora obviously had a bit of a leg up

963
00:55:10,670 --> 00:55:15,171
because it's a relatively known game, like middle tier,

964
00:55:15,231 --> 00:55:16,992
and it had some good developers on it.

965
00:55:18,453 --> 00:55:19,734
But yeah, it's worked for us as well,

966
00:55:19,814 --> 00:55:20,834
and we're going to keep doing it.

967
00:55:21,435 --> 00:55:26,058
And I recommend it if you have the time and opportunity

968
00:55:26,078 --> 00:55:26,558
to do so.

969
00:55:27,079 --> 00:55:28,980
So subtle changes can really matter,

970
00:55:29,080 --> 00:55:31,342
but don't get bogged up in the details.

971
00:55:31,782 --> 00:55:33,543
And that's it for me.

972
00:55:33,603 --> 00:55:35,745
I think we could take like a question.

973
00:55:50,324 --> 00:55:52,395
Is that no questions, then you're free.
