1
00:00:02,674 --> 00:00:03,975
All right, I'm on.

2
00:00:04,315 --> 00:00:04,775
How do I sound?

3
00:00:05,396 --> 00:00:05,576
Great.

4
00:00:06,356 --> 00:00:08,378
OK, thank you guys so much for coming.

5
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:10,039
My name's Alex Jaffe.

6
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:12,721
You can follow me on Twitter, at Blinkity.

7
00:00:12,842 --> 00:00:15,684
I'm a data scientist, a designer, and a programmer

8
00:00:15,864 --> 00:00:16,544
at Spry Fox.

9
00:00:17,665 --> 00:00:20,428
And today, I'm going to be talking about metagame balance.

10
00:00:20,968 --> 00:00:23,150
And it's going to be sort of a deep dive

11
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:25,692
into this one really, really focused aspect of game balance.

12
00:00:25,952 --> 00:00:26,853
It's kind of like a 25-minute.

13
00:00:28,333 --> 00:00:32,675
lightning talk for some 800 minute ring cycle talk that I'll give in my bathtub or something.

14
00:00:33,475 --> 00:00:37,077
And I'm really just going to be developing one big idea this whole time.

15
00:00:37,477 --> 00:00:39,959
So sort of hold tight and listen up.

16
00:00:39,979 --> 00:00:42,820
Does this work?

17
00:00:44,501 --> 00:00:44,681
All right.

18
00:00:44,861 --> 00:00:45,321
Oh, it goes that way.

19
00:00:45,421 --> 00:00:45,582
Okay.

20
00:00:46,062 --> 00:00:50,884
So in the fall of 2012, I worked on this game, PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

21
00:00:51,164 --> 00:00:54,146
It's a four-player icon brawler with all the Sony characters.

22
00:00:54,612 --> 00:00:57,693
It was my job to sort of take all the data that was coming in from players playing the game

23
00:00:57,733 --> 00:00:59,173
and help the designers balance it.

24
00:00:59,533 --> 00:01:03,374
So figure out where the game could be more interesting, or deep, or more fair,

25
00:01:03,574 --> 00:01:05,295
or, you know, just kind of more fun for players.

26
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:06,155
Look at what they're doing.

27
00:01:06,915 --> 00:01:09,616
And by the way, the game is actually really great and pretty unique,

28
00:01:09,916 --> 00:01:14,398
despite its passing resemblance to the other four-player icon brawler, Shrek Super Slam.

29
00:01:16,918 --> 00:01:20,219
So, you know, yes, we wanted to understand a lot about the game,

30
00:01:20,239 --> 00:01:23,140
but one of the things that we cared the most about was...

31
00:01:24,407 --> 00:01:24,847
It doesn't work.

32
00:01:25,968 --> 00:01:26,868
I have to point it, probably.

33
00:01:27,408 --> 00:01:28,028
OK, I'm using my keyboard.

34
00:01:28,048 --> 00:01:28,268
There we go.

35
00:01:28,288 --> 00:01:30,469
One of the things we cared the most about was character balance.

36
00:01:30,969 --> 00:01:33,770
So here I'm not talking about how the game feels to play,

37
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,710
how players play the game.

38
00:01:34,730 --> 00:01:36,671
It's more just, I have a character that I like.

39
00:01:36,711 --> 00:01:40,672
I'm coming to this game, and I want to be able to play this character and win.

40
00:01:40,692 --> 00:01:43,473
I want to be able to feel like this character is not underpowered

41
00:01:43,493 --> 00:01:46,093
or that some other character isn't overpowered.

42
00:01:46,293 --> 00:01:47,314
It's a really important concept.

43
00:01:47,394 --> 00:01:50,655
It's almost like players need to be able to play the metagame in a way that

44
00:01:50,695 --> 00:01:51,135
feels good.

45
00:01:51,741 --> 00:01:52,741
It's not the only thing that matters,

46
00:01:52,761 --> 00:01:54,342
but I think anyone who's worked on eSports

47
00:01:54,762 --> 00:01:56,723
knows that this kind of concern is pretty paramount.

48
00:01:57,023 --> 00:01:59,024
Whether you're worrying about classes in TF2,

49
00:01:59,665 --> 00:02:03,606
or loadout profiles in COD, or races in StarCraft,

50
00:02:03,686 --> 00:02:05,587
or team dynamics in League of Legends,

51
00:02:05,907 --> 00:02:07,208
this is an issue that you have to wrestle with.

52
00:02:07,668 --> 00:02:08,469
Now for most of this talk,

53
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:09,569
I'll be talking about fighting games,

54
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:10,910
because they kind of actually have

55
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:12,411
one of the simplest meta games out there.

56
00:02:12,791 --> 00:02:14,812
But I just want you to think throughout this whole thing

57
00:02:14,852 --> 00:02:16,692
about how the stuff I'm gonna talk about

58
00:02:16,733 --> 00:02:18,833
is still relevant to these other genres of games

59
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:19,794
with some modifications.

60
00:02:21,215 --> 00:02:21,315
So.

61
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:23,079
We care about character strength,

62
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:24,660
but how do we evaluate it?

63
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:25,981
And what are we even talking about

64
00:02:26,021 --> 00:02:27,443
when we say a character's overpowered?

65
00:02:27,863 --> 00:02:29,104
This is kind of one of the central questions

66
00:02:29,144 --> 00:02:29,765
I'm wrestling with.

67
00:02:30,565 --> 00:02:31,446
There are a lot of different ways

68
00:02:31,486 --> 00:02:32,407
we talk about character strength,

69
00:02:32,447 --> 00:02:33,968
and I'll focus on two right now.

70
00:02:34,809 --> 00:02:35,449
One is win rate.

71
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,552
That is, how often does Kratos win against,

72
00:02:38,832 --> 00:02:39,493
in an average game?

73
00:02:39,513 --> 00:02:41,635
Okay, and you can, if you have data from the game,

74
00:02:41,655 --> 00:02:42,596
you can plot it, you can look at it.

75
00:02:42,616 --> 00:02:43,957
You can say, okay, these characters

76
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:44,938
look a little overpowered,

77
00:02:44,958 --> 00:02:46,399
these characters look a little underpowered.

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,801
Or if you're feeling really masochistic,

79
00:02:49,261 --> 00:02:50,062
you can listen to players.

80
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:54,776
And players will tell you something completely unlike anything you've actually seen in the data.

81
00:02:55,016 --> 00:02:56,337
And it's totally perplexing, right?

82
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:59,678
This is a tier list from IGN from shortly after the game came out.

83
00:03:00,298 --> 00:03:04,080
And, you know, it says that these two characters, Kratos and Raiden,

84
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:06,080
are just completely overpowered and dominating the game.

85
00:03:06,681 --> 00:03:08,441
In contrast, if we look at their win rates,

86
00:03:08,461 --> 00:03:11,883
it sort of doesn't look like there's much correlation there at all, right?

87
00:03:11,963 --> 00:03:13,883
One of them is sort of middle, the other is middle-high.

88
00:03:15,659 --> 00:03:17,881
So while we work on this game, I think,

89
00:03:18,381 --> 00:03:20,282
I was really confused by this discrepancy.

90
00:03:20,622 --> 00:03:21,863
And it's really tempting to say, well,

91
00:03:22,043 --> 00:03:23,324
the players don't know what they're talking about

92
00:03:23,364 --> 00:03:23,984
or something, right?

93
00:03:24,585 --> 00:03:26,166
They're not great players, or even if they are,

94
00:03:26,246 --> 00:03:27,867
they only care about the guys with the big swords

95
00:03:27,907 --> 00:03:28,587
or something like that.

96
00:03:29,228 --> 00:03:32,130
And yet, we still do take their views into account

97
00:03:32,190 --> 00:03:33,310
even when we say something like that.

98
00:03:33,551 --> 00:03:35,332
When we patched the game, we tried to address win rates

99
00:03:35,412 --> 00:03:37,333
as well as the characters that players perceived

100
00:03:37,793 --> 00:03:38,374
as unbalanced.

101
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:42,316
And so, okay, one of the things that I realized

102
00:03:42,837 --> 00:03:43,637
was happening here.

103
00:03:44,107 --> 00:03:46,569
One of the properties that these characters had

104
00:03:46,629 --> 00:03:48,010
who players really thought were overpowered

105
00:03:48,931 --> 00:03:51,793
was play frequency was very, very high.

106
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,015
Why is Windows clicker?

107
00:03:54,235 --> 00:03:56,497
Okay, that is Kratos and Raiden were by far

108
00:03:56,517 --> 00:03:57,678
the most played characters in the game.

109
00:03:58,259 --> 00:04:00,300
So okay, this maybe starts to point to what's going on,

110
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,482
right, the players are just facing these opponents

111
00:04:02,622 --> 00:04:04,103
over and over again, it's like it's no wonder

112
00:04:04,143 --> 00:04:05,905
it's frustrating and we have to think about

113
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,246
player experience, that's what we're doing, right?

114
00:04:07,266 --> 00:04:08,927
We're trying to create a good player experience.

115
00:04:09,668 --> 00:04:12,410
So, this suggests a totally different way

116
00:04:12,430 --> 00:04:13,331
to think about game balance.

117
00:04:13,861 --> 00:04:22,468
Maybe we could just look at play frequency as our sort of canonical truth of what it means for a character or an asymmetric option in general to be unbalanced.

118
00:04:22,908 --> 00:04:25,671
And maybe we just nerf the most played options.

119
00:04:26,591 --> 00:04:31,395
I mean, there are several reasons why that's not a good idea, but I still think there's some fundamental nugget of truth to why this is good.

120
00:04:31,916 --> 00:04:34,238
First of all, let's say we restrict to expert players.

121
00:04:34,598 --> 00:04:37,360
So we just look at the play frequency for the best players in the game.

122
00:04:38,021 --> 00:04:40,723
Then, okay, this isn't just going to be people like Big Swords.

123
00:04:40,743 --> 00:04:42,304
These players are playing to win, right?

124
00:04:42,576 --> 00:04:46,559
They're picking their characters in a way that is going to let them get to the top of the rankings.

125
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:50,582
Right? So, okay, all of the characters who they're playing frequently are going to be winners.

126
00:04:51,383 --> 00:04:53,265
So then the question is, okay, is that enough?

127
00:04:53,405 --> 00:04:59,129
Can we just look at play frequency and that's our, you know, source of truth on what is too much,

128
00:04:59,169 --> 00:05:00,230
what needs to be addressed in the game?

129
00:05:01,211 --> 00:05:04,213
But there is another problem, and that is the instability of play rates.

130
00:05:05,294 --> 00:05:08,517
Here's some data from the game shortly after our first patch.

131
00:05:09,037 --> 00:05:11,039
So what these are are play rates for different characters.

132
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,801
on the second week after that patch

133
00:05:13,162 --> 00:05:14,443
and the fifth week after that patch.

134
00:05:15,123 --> 00:05:17,685
Okay, and what you see is they are all over the place.

135
00:05:18,145 --> 00:05:19,446
Right, if these players are playing to win,

136
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,507
right, and these are indeed high-skilled players,

137
00:05:22,088 --> 00:05:23,669
why are they changing so much?

138
00:05:23,729 --> 00:05:25,410
Why is Kratos almost doubling in popularity

139
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,451
over the course of a few weeks?

140
00:05:27,351 --> 00:05:29,393
Your first guess should be that,

141
00:05:29,853 --> 00:05:30,754
okay, the patch came out,

142
00:05:30,834 --> 00:05:32,535
players have figured out something new about the game.

143
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,156
Right, so now they are,

144
00:05:34,176 --> 00:05:35,717
they're realizing Kratos is more powerful,

145
00:05:35,757 --> 00:05:36,718
they've gotten better technique,

146
00:05:36,738 --> 00:05:37,558
and they are winning with him,

147
00:05:37,879 --> 00:05:38,619
so more players play him.

148
00:05:39,543 --> 00:05:41,283
But here are the win rates in the same time period.

149
00:05:41,964 --> 00:05:43,364
This graph is extremely zoomed in.

150
00:05:43,884 --> 00:05:45,585
Okay, so they're essentially not changing at all.

151
00:05:45,625 --> 00:05:48,026
These characters are staying fixed in effectiveness,

152
00:05:48,086 --> 00:05:50,767
and yet players are adopting them and leaving them behind

153
00:05:50,887 --> 00:05:52,187
for seemingly no good reason.

154
00:05:53,088 --> 00:05:55,288
Okay, so if play rates are so unstable,

155
00:05:56,529 --> 00:05:57,109
first of all, why?

156
00:05:57,609 --> 00:05:59,790
Okay, well, I said players are playing to win,

157
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:02,211
but there are multiple viable options, right?

158
00:06:02,331 --> 00:06:04,752
As we can see, like, there are actually a lot of good characters in this game

159
00:06:04,792 --> 00:06:06,092
at the top level.

160
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:07,052
It's relatively balanced.

161
00:06:07,613 --> 00:06:08,253
And unfortunately,

162
00:06:08,753 --> 00:06:11,335
Players have free will, and so we can't just, you know,

163
00:06:11,375 --> 00:06:12,335
know exactly what they're gonna do.

164
00:06:12,375 --> 00:06:13,496
There are a lot of options.

165
00:06:14,476 --> 00:06:16,217
We would love it if we could just predict the future,

166
00:06:16,317 --> 00:06:17,757
like, okay, this game comes out.

167
00:06:18,018 --> 00:06:18,958
It's been out for a couple days.

168
00:06:18,998 --> 00:06:20,619
We sort of get all the data on the left side.

169
00:06:20,979 --> 00:06:22,239
Now, we wanna know where the game is heading.

170
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,360
Like, is some character just going

171
00:06:23,380 --> 00:06:24,641
to completely dominate the metagame?

172
00:06:24,661 --> 00:06:26,601
So it'd be great if we could predict

173
00:06:26,641 --> 00:06:27,802
the right side of this graph, right?

174
00:06:27,822 --> 00:06:30,543
Know right away, okay, like, Kratos is just gonna

175
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:32,364
start dominating, and we wanna patch him or something.

176
00:06:32,962 --> 00:06:35,423
Or maybe even predict it solely from playtesting, right?

177
00:06:35,724 --> 00:06:37,425
Get some data ourselves, never release the game,

178
00:06:37,465 --> 00:06:38,926
and put it out in a state where this doesn't happen.

179
00:06:39,667 --> 00:06:41,768
But of course, as I said, the problem is players have free will,

180
00:06:41,808 --> 00:06:42,348
they have choice.

181
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,551
There are all these different states Drake might go to, right?

182
00:06:45,891 --> 00:06:48,593
He might, you know, players might decide to play him less,

183
00:06:48,653 --> 00:06:49,834
they might decide to play him a ton.

184
00:06:50,675 --> 00:06:52,496
It's pretty hard to just predict the future

185
00:06:52,676 --> 00:06:54,057
when, you know, we're dealing with human beings.

186
00:06:55,138 --> 00:06:56,579
So I have a more meager goal,

187
00:06:56,999 --> 00:06:59,681
and that's to predict all the futures.

188
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:02,023
So that is...

189
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:08,094
Basically to know what if we could say just something about the range of possible values for how often Drake will be played

190
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:11,257
Kind of understand this whole span of possible

191
00:07:11,958 --> 00:07:17,362
Possible metagames that we might up in end up in right and also know you know that within a few weeks say once players have

192
00:07:17,422 --> 00:07:21,146
Learned that Kratos is effective, and they've adopted him that say

193
00:07:22,527 --> 00:07:24,669
all of the metagames that we might end up in

194
00:07:25,291 --> 00:07:26,652
involve Kratos being played way too much.

195
00:07:27,073 --> 00:07:29,194
So much that it's going to frustrate players who have to play him,

196
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:30,315
frustrate players who face him,

197
00:07:30,615 --> 00:07:32,657
and also frustrate spectators if we're dealing with esports.

198
00:07:33,438 --> 00:07:35,119
Well, this would be great. This would be a great future,

199
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:37,501
oh sorry, a great reality because we can actually, you know,

200
00:07:37,701 --> 00:07:40,304
balance our games before players have kind of unbalanced them for us.

201
00:07:41,344 --> 00:07:43,246
And this is actually what I am proposing.

202
00:07:43,847 --> 00:07:44,867
I call it metagame balance.

203
00:07:45,228 --> 00:07:46,869
It's a new way to think about asymmetric strength.

204
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:59,671
You can sort of do this basically produce these bounds on the most the sort of highest frequency. We might expect to see a character be played in a reasonable metagame full of expert players and the lowest frequency.

205
00:08:00,572 --> 00:08:06,517
You know it won't be perfect, but I think by the end you'll be convinced that there's actually a way to do this.

206
00:08:07,698 --> 00:08:13,103
OK, so I'm going to talk about the metagame as I view it. It's a very, very kind of focus specific view of the metagame.

207
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:15,732
talk about how that helps us enable this construction,

208
00:08:15,772 --> 00:08:17,514
these metagame bounds, and then finally,

209
00:08:18,034 --> 00:08:20,176
how we can use those bounds to find imbalances in the game.

210
00:08:22,138 --> 00:08:22,358
All right.

211
00:08:23,519 --> 00:08:27,642
So after I finished working on PlayStation All-Stars,

212
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:31,165
I finished my PhD at the University of Washington.

213
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,087
My dissertation was on game balancing.

214
00:08:33,587 --> 00:08:34,788
And near the very, very end of it,

215
00:08:35,249 --> 00:08:37,991
I was looking at this match-up charts for Street Fighter IV.

216
00:08:38,712 --> 00:08:39,913
And something struck me about it.

217
00:08:40,373 --> 00:08:41,194
So here's how these charts work.

218
00:08:42,471 --> 00:08:44,051
You pick a character on the row, like Sea Viper.

219
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:48,612
You pick a character column, like Akuma.

220
00:08:49,812 --> 00:08:51,432
And then the six there in the middle

221
00:08:51,893 --> 00:08:54,133
means there's a six in 10 chance of that, of Feilong

222
00:08:54,153 --> 00:08:56,793
beating Akuma in a fair match of high skill game.

223
00:08:58,294 --> 00:09:01,114
Now the thing about these charts is they are totally made up.

224
00:09:01,794 --> 00:09:02,854
But they're still pretty good.

225
00:09:02,974 --> 00:09:04,235
So literally a bunch of people got

226
00:09:04,255 --> 00:09:06,075
in a room who perceive themselves

227
00:09:06,095 --> 00:09:07,255
to be expert players, and they decided

228
00:09:07,275 --> 00:09:08,095
what these numbers should be.

229
00:09:08,355 --> 00:09:09,856
So you should think, OK, I shouldn't believe these at all.

230
00:09:10,256 --> 00:09:11,816
But I argue they're still really useful.

231
00:09:12,765 --> 00:09:15,007
First of all, they're well-defined, unlike tier lists.

232
00:09:15,748 --> 00:09:17,970
S-tier, A-tier, these don't actually mean anything.

233
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,792
Everybody has a different definition for what this means.

234
00:09:20,252 --> 00:09:22,875
Whereas a 60% win rate is very, very well-defined.

235
00:09:22,995 --> 00:09:25,858
It's something we can discuss, and we can figure out what the right number is.

236
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:29,541
We can even look at actual data and figure out some approximation of the truth here.

237
00:09:30,582 --> 00:09:33,085
On top of that, it's unaffected by play frequency.

238
00:09:33,619 --> 00:09:35,520
So remember, part of the problem we're trying to wrestle with is

239
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:37,901
we can't just look at the current metagame, because it's sort of

240
00:09:38,481 --> 00:09:40,682
it's all over the place, it moves with time naturally,

241
00:09:40,702 --> 00:09:43,404
it sort of converges into these different equilibrium and moves around and

242
00:09:43,924 --> 00:09:46,105
and what we need to know is the whole possible space of this.

243
00:09:46,545 --> 00:09:48,046
So we need some source of data

244
00:09:48,646 --> 00:09:50,807
that is unaffected by this play frequency, and indeed this is.

245
00:09:51,388 --> 00:09:53,569
You know, if a lot more players start playing Sea Viper,

246
00:09:53,589 --> 00:09:56,450
that doesn't mean her win rate against Akuma is going to substantially change.

247
00:09:56,870 --> 00:09:59,852
It might change a little, because players will learn more about how to play her.

248
00:10:00,254 --> 00:10:02,317
Right, but that change will be much slower.

249
00:10:02,357 --> 00:10:04,379
Developing new techniques for a game happens slowly,

250
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:06,542
compared to movements in the metagame,

251
00:10:06,862 --> 00:10:08,364
which as I showed you happened very, very quickly.

252
00:10:08,704 --> 00:10:10,927
So even knowing the matchup chart right now is extremely useful.

253
00:10:12,509 --> 00:10:15,372
So my goal sort of is to take these matchup charts,

254
00:10:15,853 --> 00:10:18,256
these sort of impenetrable walls of numbers, and...

255
00:10:18,827 --> 00:10:22,831
and to find their secrets, like the protagonist in Pi who has this 216-digit

256
00:10:22,891 --> 00:10:25,314
string of numbers who's trying to find the secrets of God through it.

257
00:10:25,594 --> 00:10:28,257
It's kind of like that. It's like, are there some fundamental secrets of the game

258
00:10:28,577 --> 00:10:31,139
that we can find in these match-up charts, right? Do they define, like,

259
00:10:31,580 --> 00:10:33,742
how the metagame might work in all possible universes?

260
00:10:34,543 --> 00:10:37,386
And I think they do. Some people who have tried

261
00:10:37,826 --> 00:10:39,448
to analyze them before...

262
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,579
In fact, everyone who makes these match-up charts

263
00:10:41,899 --> 00:10:44,802
produces these averages, sorry, these sums on the right side.

264
00:10:45,102 --> 00:10:46,323
It's just the sum of all the numbers.

265
00:10:46,803 --> 00:10:48,865
And so they say, okay, Seth has the highest sum of numbers,

266
00:10:49,185 --> 00:10:50,666
he's maybe the strongest character in the game.

267
00:10:51,307 --> 00:10:52,447
Nobody actually believes these

268
00:10:52,467 --> 00:10:54,109
because it's totally overly simplistic.

269
00:10:54,149 --> 00:10:57,191
It says basically, basically it's how often does Seth win

270
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:58,692
against an average opponent.

271
00:10:59,313 --> 00:11:00,594
But you never face an average opponent,

272
00:11:00,634 --> 00:11:02,075
you face other strong opponents

273
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,156
who are themselves defined by their ability

274
00:11:04,176 --> 00:11:05,057
to face strong opponents.

275
00:11:05,417 --> 00:11:07,279
It's the cyclical thing that's very, very hard

276
00:11:07,319 --> 00:11:08,340
for a human to reason about.

277
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,100
But.

278
00:11:09,965 --> 00:11:12,045
it is possible for a computer to reason about.

279
00:11:12,105 --> 00:11:12,866
And that is where I'm going.

280
00:11:13,846 --> 00:11:15,906
To do that, we need to treat this match-up chart itself

281
00:11:16,347 --> 00:11:17,627
as kind of the source of information,

282
00:11:17,967 --> 00:11:19,507
the source of definition for some game.

283
00:11:19,948 --> 00:11:21,208
Basically, metagame the game.

284
00:11:21,428 --> 00:11:23,669
Not that metagame the game, Eric Zimmerman's metagame the game,

285
00:11:23,709 --> 00:11:25,569
but a different metagame the game.

286
00:11:25,629 --> 00:11:27,070
Literally, the game that is playing

287
00:11:27,090 --> 00:11:28,970
the metagame of any sort of competitive game.

288
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:32,251
And what if we take it seriously as a game worthy of analysis

289
00:11:32,711 --> 00:11:35,912
on itself, of its own, and actually analyze it?

290
00:11:38,852 --> 00:11:40,493
Well, I call it the selection game,

291
00:11:40,533 --> 00:11:41,973
just to be really clear, it needs a name,

292
00:11:42,394 --> 00:11:43,514
and it's super simple.

293
00:11:44,015 --> 00:11:45,235
We're coming to play a game of Street Fighter,

294
00:11:45,255 --> 00:11:46,876
we sit down, we're gonna pick characters to play.

295
00:11:47,137 --> 00:11:49,018
We do it simultaneously and in secret.

296
00:11:49,718 --> 00:11:50,859
Then there's some chance that I win

297
00:11:50,939 --> 00:11:51,919
based on the character I chose.

298
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:55,401
And I'm not even going to play the game,

299
00:11:55,441 --> 00:11:57,042
I'm just selecting my character, just like you,

300
00:11:57,062 --> 00:11:59,364
and then robots who play just like us will play for us.

301
00:12:00,064 --> 00:12:02,365
And then, you know, if I play Zangief and you play Guile,

302
00:12:02,446 --> 00:12:05,027
I win 60% of the time, but it's just randomness.

303
00:12:05,647 --> 00:12:07,308
So my goal now is just to pick the right characters.

304
00:12:08,242 --> 00:12:10,824
We'll treat Tides as 50% win chance for simplicity.

305
00:12:11,804 --> 00:12:12,745
Okay, what kind of game is this?

306
00:12:13,706 --> 00:12:15,467
Well, it's basically Rock, Paper, Scissors,

307
00:12:16,007 --> 00:12:17,108
which makes it sound super boring,

308
00:12:17,709 --> 00:12:19,150
but there's still something interesting here.

309
00:12:19,170 --> 00:12:21,071
It's a generalization of Rock, Paper, Scissors, right?

310
00:12:21,491 --> 00:12:24,293
This like Princess Bride poisoning game

311
00:12:24,334 --> 00:12:26,035
where we're like, you know, trying to figure,

312
00:12:26,055 --> 00:12:27,136
I'm trying to think about what you're trying to think

313
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:28,417
about what I'm trying to think, this Yomi game.

314
00:12:29,177 --> 00:12:30,398
But the good news about these games

315
00:12:30,578 --> 00:12:32,540
is that they are well covered by game theory.

316
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,001
We know how to analyze them extremely well.

317
00:12:36,010 --> 00:12:37,891
And the most important concept you need to know here

318
00:12:38,432 --> 00:12:39,752
is the notion of an optimal strategy,

319
00:12:40,373 --> 00:12:42,194
which just means it's a way that I can play such that

320
00:12:42,574 --> 00:12:44,054
I win at least half of my games.

321
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,396
No matter what you do, no matter what you know

322
00:12:46,476 --> 00:12:48,477
about my strategy, I'm always going to guarantee

323
00:12:48,677 --> 00:12:49,617
that I win half the games.

324
00:12:53,059 --> 00:12:55,200
The problem is that any fixed strategy can be exploited.

325
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:57,221
If I just play rock and you know that,

326
00:12:57,721 --> 00:12:59,342
then you will win every time, because you'll win paper.

327
00:13:00,263 --> 00:13:01,103
You'll play paper, excuse me.

328
00:13:01,563 --> 00:13:03,845
But if I play randomly, if there's some unpredictability,

329
00:13:04,365 --> 00:13:05,085
then I can do better.

330
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:07,839
So we have this notion of a mixed strategy,

331
00:13:08,159 --> 00:13:10,519
which is a probability distribution over these pure strategies.

332
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,981
And so if I play one-third rock, one-third paper, and one-third scissors,

333
00:13:15,641 --> 00:13:18,542
then there's nothing you can do to exploit the knowledge of that strategy.

334
00:13:19,622 --> 00:13:23,083
Even if you decide to play rock, you win half the time.

335
00:13:23,464 --> 00:13:25,524
If you play paper, you win half the time. No matter what.

336
00:13:25,864 --> 00:13:28,325
If you play some randomized strategy, you still win at most half the time.

337
00:13:29,566 --> 00:13:32,606
So, uniformly random, it wins half the time, and that's optimal.

338
00:13:32,827 --> 00:13:34,627
Since the game is symmetric, I can't ever do better.

339
00:13:35,087 --> 00:13:36,807
than guaranteeing winning half the time.

340
00:13:38,528 --> 00:13:40,049
Okay, so that's all the game theory I'm gonna teach you,

341
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,209
it's like one slide or something.

342
00:13:41,450 --> 00:13:42,870
I recommend Frank Lance's Game Theory Talk,

343
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,531
it's an hour and there's a lot more interesting stuff in it.

344
00:13:45,011 --> 00:13:45,952
But this is all we need for now.

345
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:49,773
Okay, so now I can actually talk about

346
00:13:49,793 --> 00:13:51,114
how we construct these metagame bounds.

347
00:13:52,615 --> 00:13:54,716
So, you might see where I'm going.

348
00:13:55,416 --> 00:13:58,838
We have a, you know, say a selection game like this.

349
00:13:59,038 --> 00:14:00,378
This is some StarCraft II data

350
00:14:00,698 --> 00:14:01,859
from some tournaments a few years ago.

351
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:06,657
And now we want to know what rate should I play each of these characters?

352
00:14:07,117 --> 00:14:12,519
How often should I play Terran to ensure that I don't get dominated by, say, my bad matchup against,

353
00:14:12,659 --> 00:14:15,759
or how often should I play Protoss to make sure I don't get dominated by my bad matchup against Protoss?

354
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:17,800
Bad example. Anyway.

355
00:14:20,241 --> 00:14:21,961
The way we solve this is with a linear program.

356
00:14:22,321 --> 00:14:26,442
It's just like this, it's really simple. You just plug it into an LP solver, let it run, and voila, you get your probabilities.

357
00:14:27,162 --> 00:14:28,503
You don't actually need to know how that works.

358
00:14:29,549 --> 00:14:34,691
But it is actually quite simple if you have the right libraries, literally it's just a few lines of code.

359
00:14:35,291 --> 00:14:39,733
And you can efficiently find the solution to any of these games, these zero-sum games.

360
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:44,575
You can find the probability distribution that you must play to win as best you can.

361
00:14:45,576 --> 00:14:48,297
So here let's say it's 36% Terran, 34% Protoss.

362
00:14:49,237 --> 00:14:52,619
Could these be, like, should we think of these as the expected frequencies

363
00:14:52,919 --> 00:14:55,620
that we would see Terran and Protoss and Zerg appearing in the wild?

364
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,440
Since that's our goal.

365
00:14:57,545 --> 00:14:59,186
Well, no, because there are actually two problems with that.

366
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:04,427
The first is that I've been treating this game of selecting, say, characters in a fighting

367
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:05,908
game as this one-time thing.

368
00:15:06,148 --> 00:15:10,029
I sit down, we play together, every round I'm going to pick a character independently

369
00:15:10,069 --> 00:15:10,609
from the last.

370
00:15:11,009 --> 00:15:13,950
But that is not how communities work, and specifically that's not how eSports work.

371
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:18,151
These games have huge execution barriers, require a ton of skill, and you know, for

372
00:15:18,171 --> 00:15:22,412
a game like Street Fighter, say, you know, a character may, sorry, a player may spend

373
00:15:22,452 --> 00:15:23,953
years training with one character.

374
00:15:24,238 --> 00:15:27,580
They're not just gonna pick the character that's gonna, you know, do the best in this particular matchup.

375
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:29,502
They're gonna be kind of stuck on their character.

376
00:15:29,522 --> 00:15:33,304
So it seems like these single round games, these zero-sum games,

377
00:15:33,784 --> 00:15:37,046
these selection games, can't really say much about what a real community will look like.

378
00:15:37,667 --> 00:15:39,268
Right? Because it has to do with this very human property.

379
00:15:39,288 --> 00:15:43,510
It's kind of like spanning outside the magic circle of what people train over time.

380
00:15:44,471 --> 00:15:48,613
But I have an argument that there actually is a much deeper connection between these two models than you might think.

381
00:15:49,434 --> 00:15:53,116
So consider the following model for how a community forms, okay?

382
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,505
Imagine you have a third reuse, a third Zangiefs, and a third Cammys in some community of Street Fighter players.

383
00:15:58,965 --> 00:16:04,471
And they're basically stuck on their characters. Everybody plays their character almost all the time because it's so important to train with that one.

384
00:16:05,091 --> 00:16:10,657
But then a new player comes along and he's going to play for a while and pick the character that lets him totally dominate the current characters.

385
00:16:11,198 --> 00:16:15,342
So he picks Fei Long, right, because Fei Long has an advantage against each of these.

386
00:16:15,742 --> 00:16:16,883
And the new player comes along and...

387
00:16:18,383 --> 00:16:19,703
She picks Feilong too, right?

388
00:16:19,803 --> 00:16:21,424
Because Feilong has this advantage.

389
00:16:21,444 --> 00:16:22,024
It's great, right?

390
00:16:22,044 --> 00:16:23,725
You can basically exploit the weakness

391
00:16:23,765 --> 00:16:24,465
in the current community.

392
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:25,906
And this keeps happening for a while

393
00:16:25,966 --> 00:16:27,446
until finally there are a lot of Feilongs.

394
00:16:27,846 --> 00:16:29,007
And then someone has this amazing idea.

395
00:16:29,047 --> 00:16:30,807
They realize, like, I'm gonna play Balrog

396
00:16:30,827 --> 00:16:32,528
because Balrog has an advantage against Feilong

397
00:16:32,788 --> 00:16:34,389
and now I can get more wins, right?

398
00:16:35,009 --> 00:16:36,690
So imagine this is a process.

399
00:16:36,810 --> 00:16:38,830
This is a process that describes how your community forms.

400
00:16:39,203 --> 00:16:41,324
seems not so crazy far from reality.

401
00:16:41,745 --> 00:16:44,466
But the amazing fact is that this process is identical

402
00:16:44,806 --> 00:16:46,807
to an algorithm called fictitious play.

403
00:16:47,127 --> 00:16:49,508
And this algorithm is a way to compute

404
00:16:49,868 --> 00:16:51,609
the optimal strategy to a selection game.

405
00:16:52,209 --> 00:16:54,190
Which means that over time,

406
00:16:54,590 --> 00:16:56,391
the percentage of players who we see

407
00:16:56,451 --> 00:16:57,972
sort of playing Ryu in a community

408
00:16:58,492 --> 00:17:00,173
is going to converge to the percentage chance

409
00:17:00,213 --> 00:17:02,013
that you should play Ryu in a single round of this game.

410
00:17:03,085 --> 00:17:04,306
Okay, this is really important.

411
00:17:04,326 --> 00:17:06,547
This means that we have this selection game, right?

412
00:17:06,928 --> 00:17:09,409
We have this little game where you and I just play once,

413
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,111
but however it is that I should play that game

414
00:17:11,151 --> 00:17:14,053
is actually how we should see an entire community of players

415
00:17:14,193 --> 00:17:16,174
kind of like adopting characters over the course of years.

416
00:17:16,815 --> 00:17:18,116
Again, I've oversimplified the model,

417
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,697
but I think it points to some fundamental truth.

418
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:23,260
So now it seems like, okay, we're in a position

419
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:25,561
where we can take these matchup charts or selection games

420
00:17:25,922 --> 00:17:27,643
and we can compute an optimal strategy for them

421
00:17:28,043 --> 00:17:29,704
and hopefully get some information

422
00:17:29,744 --> 00:17:31,626
about which characters are gonna get played in the wild.

423
00:17:33,156 --> 00:17:34,697
We do this here for that Street Fighter 4 chart,

424
00:17:34,737 --> 00:17:35,618
and you get something like this,

425
00:17:36,359 --> 00:17:38,020
which is totally, utterly wrong.

426
00:17:38,720 --> 00:17:40,222
If you've ever played Street Fighter 4,

427
00:17:40,542 --> 00:17:41,202
you know that first of all,

428
00:17:41,242 --> 00:17:43,864
more than nine of the 39 characters get played.

429
00:17:44,145 --> 00:17:46,106
This was before the recent patch, there were 39.

430
00:17:46,947 --> 00:17:49,389
Moreover, a third of the players don't play Balrog.

431
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:51,550
That is not reality.

432
00:17:51,791 --> 00:17:52,671
Balrog's a fine character,

433
00:17:52,691 --> 00:17:54,232
but it is not a third of the players.

434
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:57,235
So there's still one problem with our method here.

435
00:17:58,095 --> 00:17:59,977
And the problem is that perfectly optimal play

436
00:18:00,137 --> 00:18:01,858
is not realistic, right?

437
00:18:02,252 --> 00:18:03,132
Players may play to win.

438
00:18:03,312 --> 00:18:05,133
Players may be very good at playing to win.

439
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:09,174
And despite this, they're not going to play perfectly.

440
00:18:09,754 --> 00:18:11,915
They might play some approximation of perfectly.

441
00:18:12,715 --> 00:18:15,256
And beyond that, there's some noise in the data.

442
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:16,157
We have these match-up charts.

443
00:18:16,297 --> 00:18:16,937
They're not perfect.

444
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:19,878
Even if we've taken them from real data from the wild,

445
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:21,099
they're still going to be noisy.

446
00:18:21,399 --> 00:18:23,239
So we can't have this very stringent dependency

447
00:18:23,740 --> 00:18:26,080
on absolutely perfect optimal play

448
00:18:26,100 --> 00:18:27,441
if we want to learn something about our game.

449
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,782
But we can think about approximately optimal play.

450
00:18:31,729 --> 00:18:38,932
So the idea is, okay, we want to know how often you can win while playing Balrog some percentage of the time.

451
00:18:39,132 --> 00:18:44,293
We want to know, can you play, is it possible to have a very effective community that has 12% Balrog in it?

452
00:18:44,694 --> 00:18:49,555
So we force our strategy to play Balrog 12% of the time, and then we check, can you still win a lot, essentially?

453
00:18:49,895 --> 00:18:53,837
So we modify our linear program, you don't need to know the details here, but you put one more constraint on it,

454
00:18:54,297 --> 00:18:55,377
and then you pop out here.

455
00:18:58,608 --> 00:19:00,149
this set of play rates.

456
00:19:00,510 --> 00:19:01,891
It's totally different than the last one.

457
00:19:02,531 --> 00:19:06,415
Right? And this says, OK, this is the one where we know Balrog is played exactly 12% of the time.

458
00:19:06,715 --> 00:19:09,317
And then we can check the one where he's played 13% of the time.

459
00:19:09,657 --> 00:19:10,578
And 14% of the time.

460
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,420
And sort of explore this whole space

461
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,482
of what play rates look like

462
00:19:14,542 --> 00:19:16,563
when one of the characters appears at some frequency.

463
00:19:17,524 --> 00:19:19,406
Alright. And this actually gets us what we want.

464
00:19:20,067 --> 00:19:21,268
Because now we can make a chart like this.

465
00:19:22,048 --> 00:19:24,290
And let me make sure you really understand what this chart is saying.

466
00:19:24,731 --> 00:19:25,751
At the bottom we have play rates.

467
00:19:26,171 --> 00:19:28,012
that is played 5% of the time,

468
00:19:28,052 --> 00:19:29,792
or 20% of your community, or whatever.

469
00:19:30,832 --> 00:19:32,453
And then the two sides of this interval

470
00:19:32,493 --> 00:19:33,733
tell you the minimum frequency

471
00:19:33,773 --> 00:19:35,334
you should expect this character to occur,

472
00:19:35,774 --> 00:19:38,235
and the maximum frequency you should expect them to occur.

473
00:19:38,815 --> 00:19:40,255
So this says Balrog,

474
00:19:40,375 --> 00:19:42,476
in any stable, strong Street Fighter community

475
00:19:42,496 --> 00:19:45,397
that wins most of the time against any kind of outsider

476
00:19:45,437 --> 00:19:46,337
who tries to exploit them,

477
00:19:47,037 --> 00:19:49,438
you'll see at least 3% Balrog or something.

478
00:19:49,918 --> 00:19:50,739
But you'll see at most 35%.

479
00:19:52,695 --> 00:19:53,776
So it's actually a huge range.

480
00:19:53,836 --> 00:19:55,236
Players have a lot of freedom in this game

481
00:19:55,276 --> 00:19:56,557
to pick the characters they want to pick.

482
00:19:56,937 --> 00:20:00,718
And everyone can appear at least at some frequency

483
00:20:00,858 --> 00:20:02,759
within a sort of strong competitive meta game.

484
00:20:03,660 --> 00:20:04,060
So that's great.

485
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:05,480
I mean, Street Fighter IV is a very balanced game.

486
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,781
But the real purpose of these bounds

487
00:20:08,521 --> 00:20:11,903
is to help us find problems in our meta, right?

488
00:20:11,943 --> 00:20:12,703
Possible problems.

489
00:20:12,723 --> 00:20:15,244
So I'm gonna talk about three kinds of characters

490
00:20:15,284 --> 00:20:16,384
that these graphs let you find.

491
00:20:16,885 --> 00:20:19,245
I'll call them always excluded, sometimes dominant,

492
00:20:19,686 --> 00:20:20,826
and always dominant characters.

493
00:20:21,926 --> 00:20:22,127
All right.

494
00:20:22,767 --> 00:20:24,468
So I just want to be absolutely sure we understand

495
00:20:24,488 --> 00:20:25,088
what this graph means.

496
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,450
It means, if you look at the character at the top left,

497
00:20:28,270 --> 00:20:30,432
at the top, then the left point means

498
00:20:30,772 --> 00:20:32,513
you have to play Balrog at least 5% of the time

499
00:20:32,734 --> 00:20:33,534
in a stable community.

500
00:20:33,834 --> 00:20:34,875
The right point means you have to play him

501
00:20:34,895 --> 00:20:36,076
at most 40% of the time.

502
00:20:36,656 --> 00:20:36,897
All right.

503
00:20:37,977 --> 00:20:38,898
So, finding imbalances.

504
00:20:39,718 --> 00:20:41,840
Here's a matchup chart that I derived from some data,

505
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:45,002
again, player made up, on Smash Wiki

506
00:20:45,402 --> 00:20:46,623
for Super Smash Brothers Melee.

507
00:20:46,643 --> 00:20:49,385
You don't need to look at the numbers.

508
00:20:50,326 --> 00:20:52,047
What you do need to see is,

509
00:20:52,767 --> 00:20:54,188
the matchup charts that it produces.

510
00:20:55,269 --> 00:20:59,231
So I want to focus your attention first on these entries.

511
00:21:00,172 --> 00:21:01,693
Okay, these are the ones where the right side

512
00:21:01,713 --> 00:21:03,194
of the green bar is all the way to the left.

513
00:21:03,674 --> 00:21:06,676
And what that means is that at most 0% of the players

514
00:21:06,716 --> 00:21:09,718
in a community can play young Link or Link or Yoshi

515
00:21:10,158 --> 00:21:12,640
and still have some success, okay?

516
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:14,221
So that's not good.

517
00:21:14,261 --> 00:21:16,682
You want a game in which players have freedom,

518
00:21:16,983 --> 00:21:18,644
in which players are able to do,

519
00:21:19,364 --> 00:21:21,505
kind of be able to participate as any character, right,

520
00:21:21,545 --> 00:21:22,286
and actually contribute.

521
00:21:23,372 --> 00:21:23,652
And win.

522
00:21:24,293 --> 00:21:25,853
So this is sort of an immediate problem.

523
00:21:25,873 --> 00:21:27,994
Maybe you want to buff these characters, right?

524
00:21:28,334 --> 00:21:30,955
And this is not something you necessarily can easily find

525
00:21:30,995 --> 00:21:32,256
in the matchup charts because it depends

526
00:21:32,296 --> 00:21:35,177
on the interdependencies of the characters

527
00:21:35,357 --> 00:21:36,757
and who they beat and who beats them.

528
00:21:37,798 --> 00:21:38,478
Another thing we can look for

529
00:21:38,498 --> 00:21:40,099
are these sometimes dominant characters.

530
00:21:40,579 --> 00:21:42,920
So Fox, Falco, Marth, and Samus pop out here.

531
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,240
These are characters for whom,

532
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,761
if the players had their druthers,

533
00:21:46,061 --> 00:21:48,102
they could play some enormous frequency.

534
00:21:48,576 --> 00:21:52,078
What this basically tells us is that if every player in the entire game wanted to play Fox,

535
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:55,319
they could do so and there would be nothing anyone else could really do to stop them.

536
00:21:55,719 --> 00:21:59,601
There's no other character that can come in and exploit the fact that everybody's playing Fox.

537
00:21:59,901 --> 00:22:02,602
It's like if you had this rock, paper, scissors community where everybody's playing rock,

538
00:22:02,642 --> 00:22:05,364
but there's just nothing that actually forces you to play something else.

539
00:22:06,064 --> 00:22:07,865
Now, as a designer, you basically have your choice.

540
00:22:07,905 --> 00:22:10,266
It's a matter of taste whether or not you want to do something about this.

541
00:22:11,029 --> 00:22:13,171
Maybe you think it's fine if everybody wants to play Fox,

542
00:22:13,191 --> 00:22:13,531
they won't.

543
00:22:13,571 --> 00:22:14,872
They will naturally self-distribute.

544
00:22:15,212 --> 00:22:15,773
That's reasonable.

545
00:22:16,193 --> 00:22:18,295
In our case, we had too many players playing Kratos.

546
00:22:18,475 --> 00:22:19,776
We didn't like it, and the players didn't like it.

547
00:22:20,196 --> 00:22:22,138
So I think it would have been really nice to actually know

548
00:22:22,478 --> 00:22:23,899
that this was kind of this possibility

549
00:22:23,959 --> 00:22:25,960
and find a version of the game in which that

550
00:22:25,980 --> 00:22:28,282
wasn't the case, which would require, essentially,

551
00:22:28,682 --> 00:22:31,044
giving other characters counters to Kratos,

552
00:22:31,084 --> 00:22:32,866
finding ways that they can force Kratos out

553
00:22:32,906 --> 00:22:33,866
of this dominant position.

554
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:36,168
And then after producing those, you

555
00:22:36,188 --> 00:22:38,150
can actually test them with the new match-up charts

556
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,911
and see whether you've solved the problem.

557
00:22:41,020 --> 00:22:42,561
So finally, they're always dominant characters.

558
00:22:43,362 --> 00:22:45,063
Now I'm looking at Super Smash Brothers Brawl data,

559
00:22:45,343 --> 00:22:47,725
which has an infamous problem, and you can see it here.

560
00:22:48,825 --> 00:22:53,028
So Meta Knight has to be played at least 55% of the time

561
00:22:53,188 --> 00:22:54,309
in any strong community.

562
00:22:54,589 --> 00:22:55,870
If you don't play him that much,

563
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,471
Meta Knights will come in and destroy you.

564
00:22:57,811 --> 00:22:59,672
Okay, so there's this kind of inevitability

565
00:23:00,053 --> 00:23:01,954
that no matter what, Meta Knight's going

566
00:23:01,974 --> 00:23:02,955
to completely dominate this game.

567
00:23:03,315 --> 00:23:05,556
Obviously you don't want this situation, right?

568
00:23:06,277 --> 00:23:08,038
You may have one criticism, which is that,

569
00:23:10,199 --> 00:23:10,820
yeah, which is that.

570
00:23:11,452 --> 00:23:12,993
If you look at the matchups for Meta Knight,

571
00:23:13,433 --> 00:23:15,314
they are totally, obviously overpowered.

572
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,775
Like, all his numbers are ridiculously high.

573
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,395
He doesn't look anything like the other characters.

574
00:23:18,715 --> 00:23:20,376
You don't need all this fancy game theory

575
00:23:20,456 --> 00:23:21,617
to discover that, right?

576
00:23:22,317 --> 00:23:23,397
But this is an extreme case.

577
00:23:24,478 --> 00:23:25,298
What about these matchups?

578
00:23:25,939 --> 00:23:27,519
This is for PlayStation All-Stars Battle Royale.

579
00:23:27,539 --> 00:23:29,540
This is taken for median skill players,

580
00:23:29,820 --> 00:23:31,041
but equally informative.

581
00:23:32,501 --> 00:23:33,522
Now, if you look at this, again,

582
00:23:33,562 --> 00:23:34,802
I know you can't really see the numbers.

583
00:23:35,323 --> 00:23:37,083
The question is, is there a character here

584
00:23:37,143 --> 00:23:37,964
who totally dominates?

585
00:23:37,984 --> 00:23:39,965
Is there one character like, you know,

586
00:23:39,985 --> 00:23:41,265
who just takes over the meta?

587
00:23:41,912 --> 00:23:43,313
I think it's pretty hard to see,

588
00:23:44,053 --> 00:23:46,194
but when you actually do the computation, you see this.

589
00:23:47,956 --> 00:23:49,417
So it says that Sackboy has to be played

590
00:23:49,457 --> 00:23:50,597
basically half the time.

591
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,419
Half of the players have to play Sackboy

592
00:23:52,999 --> 00:23:56,221
in any of the convergent states of this metagame.

593
00:23:57,082 --> 00:23:59,243
And this is really, really important to know.

594
00:23:59,263 --> 00:24:01,545
And I just want to go back again just to show you this.

595
00:24:01,905 --> 00:24:02,886
There's nothing obvious here.

596
00:24:02,946 --> 00:24:04,327
Sackboy's the third highest character.

597
00:24:04,347 --> 00:24:06,448
He has a 5.7 average matchup.

598
00:24:06,948 --> 00:24:08,790
It's really about this kind of, you know,

599
00:24:09,472 --> 00:24:11,473
cyclical interplay between all these characters.

600
00:24:11,673 --> 00:24:13,854
It just so happens that the way his advantages

601
00:24:13,894 --> 00:24:14,895
and disadvantages work out,

602
00:24:14,975 --> 00:24:16,616
this is kind of a necessary consequence.

603
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,178
And just as some confirmation of this reality,

604
00:24:20,819 --> 00:24:22,620
here are the frequencies of play for Sackboy

605
00:24:22,780 --> 00:24:23,901
in the first three weeks of the game.

606
00:24:24,881 --> 00:24:25,922
This is week one.

607
00:24:26,222 --> 00:24:27,463
They've already figured out they should play him,

608
00:24:27,483 --> 00:24:28,623
you know, 18% of the time.

609
00:24:29,024 --> 00:24:29,424
Week two, 25.

610
00:24:29,524 --> 00:24:31,865
Week three, he's more than 40% of the games

611
00:24:32,246 --> 00:24:34,047
are played by Sackboy, okay?

612
00:24:34,627 --> 00:24:36,248
And his win rates are not changing.

613
00:24:36,368 --> 00:24:37,669
This is players figuring it out.

614
00:24:38,307 --> 00:24:40,308
They're realizing very, very quickly the meta is broken.

615
00:24:41,028 --> 00:24:44,370
And imagine if we had that matchup chart early on,

616
00:24:44,871 --> 00:24:46,392
and we also had these tools, right,

617
00:24:46,412 --> 00:24:47,352
that would enable us to see

618
00:24:47,772 --> 00:24:49,493
where this was all inevitably heading, right?

619
00:24:49,874 --> 00:24:52,235
That Sackboy had this kind of inevitable place here.

620
00:24:52,815 --> 00:24:53,936
Now, this is high-skill data,

621
00:24:53,976 --> 00:24:55,677
so it's a little different from the median-skill data

622
00:24:55,697 --> 00:24:56,397
I showed you before,

623
00:24:56,838 --> 00:24:59,059
but just as a consequence of how much data I have,

624
00:24:59,099 --> 00:25:00,260
but the same principle applies.

625
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:01,801
Basically,

626
00:25:03,415 --> 00:25:05,355
I think we need to try this.

627
00:25:05,455 --> 00:25:08,096
I think it's worth actually applying these methods

628
00:25:08,416 --> 00:25:11,257
in the middle of a game, early on in the game's development.

629
00:25:11,437 --> 00:25:14,398
And it's not just about applying the tools or something.

630
00:25:14,938 --> 00:25:17,579
Although, you should know, I put the code online.

631
00:25:17,859 --> 00:25:19,899
You can try it yourself, this GitHub URL.

632
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:20,960
It's really, really simple.

633
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:24,120
All you do is you take a little CSV of matchup charts,

634
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:26,241
if you have them, how often each character wins,

635
00:25:26,321 --> 00:25:27,841
and it outputs some graphs like that.

636
00:25:28,282 --> 00:25:29,602
And you can look at intermediate results too.

637
00:25:30,522 --> 00:25:31,542
And I really encourage people to do this,

638
00:25:31,562 --> 00:25:32,823
because I want to see how these methods work.

639
00:25:33,822 --> 00:25:36,323
for different kinds of games.

640
00:25:36,464 --> 00:25:37,384
There are a lot of different ways

641
00:25:37,424 --> 00:25:38,465
that we can think about

642
00:25:39,245 --> 00:25:41,287
metagame balance, and we're never going

643
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,248
to have just this one true notion of what

644
00:25:43,288 --> 00:25:45,289
balance is. But the nice thing about these methods

645
00:25:45,329 --> 00:25:47,550
is that unlike these vaguely defined

646
00:25:47,591 --> 00:25:49,272
tier lists, they start from

647
00:25:49,292 --> 00:25:51,393
this really, really reliable source

648
00:25:51,413 --> 00:25:53,134
of data, these matchups, really well-defined data.

649
00:25:53,394 --> 00:25:55,836
And they produce something that

650
00:25:55,916 --> 00:25:57,377
is kind of vaguely

651
00:25:57,417 --> 00:25:59,338
objective. It tells you not how players will

652
00:25:59,378 --> 00:26:01,079
play, but at least how they should play.

653
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:05,387
And I think there's so much potential to take this kind of data for the game,

654
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:08,808
these matchup chart data, and learn all sorts of things about the game from it.

655
00:26:08,828 --> 00:26:11,950
Like really actually step back and take the analysis of our game seriously,

656
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:14,590
and not just put games out there and kind of see what sticks

657
00:26:14,670 --> 00:26:17,872
and see which players completely destroy our game,

658
00:26:17,912 --> 00:26:20,813
but try to get ahead of them and make a game that actually

659
00:26:20,893 --> 00:26:24,074
is good for these players who are now taking them so, so seriously.

660
00:26:25,134 --> 00:26:26,695
All right, well, thanks so much for listening.

661
00:26:26,715 --> 00:26:28,915
And that's all.

662
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:41,950
I have like a few minutes for questions.

663
00:26:42,330 --> 00:26:43,571
So please.

664
00:26:43,651 --> 00:26:45,351
Oh, and also don't forget to put in your ratings

665
00:26:45,791 --> 00:26:46,972
on the rating email.

666
00:26:48,892 --> 00:26:49,993
Any questions come up to the microphones?

667
00:26:50,713 --> 00:26:51,313
Yeah, hi, over there.

668
00:26:51,353 --> 00:26:51,593
Hi there.

669
00:26:52,353 --> 00:26:54,074
I was wondering, do you think you could break down

670
00:26:54,134 --> 00:26:56,815
the metagame within the actual game into something like this

671
00:26:56,855 --> 00:26:57,815
and apply the same methods?

672
00:26:57,875 --> 00:26:59,835
Imagine like tic-tac-toe or something like that,

673
00:26:59,855 --> 00:27:01,796
where you're saying put x in the top left corner,

674
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,296
and then the next move, and stuff like that.

675
00:27:03,356 --> 00:27:05,017
I'm so glad you asked, because this gets to a point

676
00:27:05,057 --> 00:27:06,017
that I meant to mention.

677
00:27:06,317 --> 00:27:07,258
This is actually pretty key.

678
00:27:07,638 --> 00:27:10,859
The metagame is this incredibly simple game, okay?

679
00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:13,799
It's just this matrix of numbers, at least in the case of Street Fighter.

680
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:18,641
It is more amenable to game-theoretic analysis than almost any internals of any games that

681
00:27:18,681 --> 00:27:19,061
we play.

682
00:27:19,381 --> 00:27:22,242
It's a shame that we haven't looked at the metagame through game theory in the past,

683
00:27:22,262 --> 00:27:23,142
because it is the place

684
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:25,023
where we can learn the most, most easily.

685
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:26,143
And I encourage other people to do it.

686
00:27:26,403 --> 00:27:28,064
Unfortunately, you know, tic-tac-toe you can do,

687
00:27:28,104 --> 00:27:31,365
but most games are so complex that they're hard to analyze.

688
00:27:31,405 --> 00:27:33,426
I think I'm going to give it a shot with our game.

689
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:34,947
I'll tweet you the results.

690
00:27:34,967 --> 00:27:35,867
This is really, really cool.

691
00:27:35,907 --> 00:27:37,348
Yeah, you've got to tell me how it worked out.

692
00:27:37,468 --> 00:27:39,548
The charts with the match-ups and stuff like that,

693
00:27:39,568 --> 00:27:42,009
can that just be derived from metrics in your game?

694
00:27:42,089 --> 00:27:42,830
Yeah, absolutely.

695
00:27:42,870 --> 00:27:43,770
Yeah, you just look at win rates.

696
00:27:43,830 --> 00:27:44,550
Feel free to contact me.

697
00:27:44,870 --> 00:27:45,050
Yeah.

698
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:46,911
No more time for questions?

699
00:27:47,311 --> 00:27:48,152
My clock says 247.

700
00:27:48,492 --> 00:27:48,572
Oh.

701
00:27:49,492 --> 00:27:49,952
Yeah, that's right.

702
00:27:50,072 --> 00:27:50,432
I am done.

703
00:27:50,532 --> 00:27:51,333
I got confused with the time.

704
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:53,578
Let's go to the breakout room, wherever wants to talk.

705
00:27:53,678 --> 00:27:53,779
OK?

706
00:27:54,442 --> 00:27:54,783
Thanks a lot.
