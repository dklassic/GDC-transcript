1
00:00:06,463 --> 00:00:07,944
is improving the culture of critique,

2
00:00:08,224 --> 00:00:10,126
communicating across disciplines.

3
00:00:10,867 --> 00:00:12,869
It's a companion talk to a talk I gave last year.

4
00:00:12,889 --> 00:00:14,590
I'll talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

5
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:16,552
But why is this needed?

6
00:00:16,592 --> 00:00:18,654
Why do we need to talk about critique?

7
00:00:19,455 --> 00:00:20,375
Why do we need to talk about

8
00:00:20,435 --> 00:00:21,737
communicating across disciplines?

9
00:00:23,238 --> 00:00:28,001
You know, both of these things are part of our daily life in game design, but they're

10
00:00:28,021 --> 00:00:30,322
often things that we don't really focus on.

11
00:00:31,203 --> 00:00:35,626
This is also true often in art school, as both a student and teacher, I often found

12
00:00:35,646 --> 00:00:38,928
that we assumed a lot about critique without ever really focusing on it.

13
00:00:39,656 --> 00:00:40,657
I'll talk about that in a minute.

14
00:00:41,418 --> 00:00:45,583
But when we don't focus on it, and when it goes poorly, as unfortunately it all too often

15
00:00:45,603 --> 00:00:53,633
does, our efficiency goes down, morale certainly goes down, and especially when we think about

16
00:00:53,693 --> 00:00:55,315
communicating across disciplines.

17
00:00:56,215 --> 00:01:00,236
we start to lose good ideas that aren't being communicated,

18
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:03,437
ideas that come from elsewhere, from others,

19
00:01:03,798 --> 00:01:06,499
from otherness that we miss.

20
00:01:06,539 --> 00:01:07,879
And when we miss good ideas,

21
00:01:08,559 --> 00:01:09,920
the quality of our work goes down.

22
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:11,760
So these issues are really important,

23
00:01:12,021 --> 00:01:14,221
and they're issues that are certainly very dear to my heart.

24
00:01:14,942 --> 00:01:17,523
Before I started working in harmonics,

25
00:01:18,283 --> 00:01:22,206
As an artist, I spent about 10 years as a teacher.

26
00:01:22,266 --> 00:01:23,687
I taught at the Royal School of Design.

27
00:01:23,747 --> 00:01:26,329
I taught at the New York Academy, among other schools.

28
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:29,611
And during that time and since that time,

29
00:01:29,651 --> 00:01:31,693
I've continued teaching in lots of workshops

30
00:01:31,793 --> 00:01:34,455
at places like the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Fisher Price,

31
00:01:34,535 --> 00:01:36,336
Turbine, also at Harmonics.

32
00:01:37,477 --> 00:01:38,918
And throughout all this teaching,

33
00:01:39,953 --> 00:01:43,034
One of the things that has been, was always really important to me,

34
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:45,574
and something I loved thinking about, was critique.

35
00:01:45,895 --> 00:01:47,175
How do we assess each other's work?

36
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,735
How do we talk about each other's work?

37
00:01:49,335 --> 00:01:51,836
It seemed to be something that a lot of other art teachers

38
00:01:52,216 --> 00:01:53,036
didn't focus on.

39
00:01:53,316 --> 00:01:56,336
They tended to have a kind of throw the students in the water

40
00:01:56,396 --> 00:01:58,337
and let's see how they swim approach.

41
00:01:58,477 --> 00:02:00,597
That's, I don't want to, that's not the case of everyone.

42
00:02:00,617 --> 00:02:02,658
There are certainly a lot of art professors and teachers

43
00:02:02,958 --> 00:02:04,218
who also think about this a lot,

44
00:02:04,598 --> 00:02:07,138
but it was something I really enjoyed thinking about.

45
00:02:07,778 --> 00:02:11,882
And it was something that I brought over when I started working at Harmonix.

46
00:02:12,343 --> 00:02:17,868
And over the last eight or nine years, I've had the real pleasure to first start off as

47
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:19,349
a character artist on Rock Band 3.

48
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:24,494
I was the lead environment artist on Fantasia, Music Evolved, returned to some character

49
00:02:24,514 --> 00:02:26,756
work for Rock Band 4, and then back doing...

50
00:02:27,256 --> 00:02:30,137
environmental stuff with some wonderful abstract,

51
00:02:30,277 --> 00:02:31,958
musically reactive, abstract sculptures

52
00:02:31,998 --> 00:02:34,159
and harmonics music of VR.

53
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,500
And more recently I've been doing some UI work

54
00:02:36,921 --> 00:02:39,322
on Sing Space, the karaoke game from Harmonix

55
00:02:39,682 --> 00:02:41,303
that'll be coming out really soon.

56
00:02:41,343 --> 00:02:44,104
It was being demoed down in the Unity booth.

57
00:02:44,144 --> 00:02:46,845
Some of you may have had a chance to try it this week.

58
00:02:47,650 --> 00:02:51,651
In addition to that, outside of work, I've been, I was a co-founder of a group called

59
00:02:51,691 --> 00:02:52,291
Secret Portal.

60
00:02:52,791 --> 00:02:58,193
We're really interested in using VR in public spaces and really finding ways for people

61
00:02:58,213 --> 00:03:00,854
in physical and virtual worlds to interact with each other.

62
00:03:00,974 --> 00:03:05,356
And we've done a number of installations and theatrical performances at the Museum

63
00:03:05,376 --> 00:03:07,156
of Fine Arts in Boston over the last three years.

64
00:03:08,719 --> 00:03:13,242
So, last year I gave a talk called Maximizing Critique, and that talk really focused on

65
00:03:13,282 --> 00:03:17,665
strategies for giving and receiving feedback kind of on individual levels, and really focused

66
00:03:17,705 --> 00:03:20,366
on this idea that everyone is responsible in this conversation.

67
00:03:20,406 --> 00:03:24,028
If you're giving or receiving, there are ways to make that conversation more valuable.

68
00:03:25,209 --> 00:03:29,491
This year I'm expanding from that and having a companion piece to that, which is pulling

69
00:03:29,511 --> 00:03:33,133
the camera out a little bit and looking at the overall culture of critique, especially

70
00:03:33,434 --> 00:03:36,135
how we communicate with disciplines other than our own.

71
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:40,763
There'll be a little bit of overlap, but they're really companion pieces.

72
00:03:41,724 --> 00:03:43,525
Was anyone at my talk last year?

73
00:03:43,966 --> 00:03:44,726
Oh, great.

74
00:03:44,907 --> 00:03:45,627
Thanks for coming back.

75
00:03:46,368 --> 00:03:47,969
There'll be a little bit of overlap, but not much.

76
00:03:48,009 --> 00:03:49,711
I'm really trying to cover a lot of new ground.

77
00:03:50,292 --> 00:03:52,434
And if you weren't at the talk last year, you don't need to.

78
00:03:52,734 --> 00:03:54,435
Neither is a prerequisite for the other.

79
00:03:55,336 --> 00:03:57,899
So let's talk a little bit about communicating across disciplines.

80
00:03:59,514 --> 00:04:03,237
We were all in our own disciplines. Here's a kind of variety of them that

81
00:04:03,578 --> 00:04:07,381
exist in most game studios and within that there's a lot of areas where we

82
00:04:07,441 --> 00:04:10,384
overlap, where it's easy for us to communicate, we share common ground.

83
00:04:10,864 --> 00:04:14,407
But there's a lot of places where we don't overlap. We may have different

84
00:04:14,447 --> 00:04:17,430
languages for describing the same thing. We have different kinds of experiences,

85
00:04:17,710 --> 00:04:21,753
different points of view, and that is when it's really hard to communicate.

86
00:04:22,094 --> 00:04:24,155
In many ways it's almost like we're communicating across cultures.

87
00:04:24,876 --> 00:04:26,858
and that's when communication can break down.

88
00:04:27,178 --> 00:04:29,259
However, it's during those moments

89
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:32,782
that communication is the most important for us to have

90
00:04:32,822 --> 00:04:34,923
because that is when we bring our difference

91
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:37,125
into the conversation, our unique point of view.

92
00:04:37,525 --> 00:04:40,247
So ironically, the most difficult conversations

93
00:04:40,427 --> 00:04:41,628
are the most important to have.

94
00:04:42,393 --> 00:04:44,314
Maybe that's not erotic, maybe that's just part of life.

95
00:04:45,114 --> 00:04:46,794
But in any case, it's certainly the case here.

96
00:04:47,534 --> 00:04:50,055
And so, now here's a little bit of a review from last year.

97
00:04:50,095 --> 00:04:51,415
I'll kind of go over it, not too long,

98
00:04:51,435 --> 00:04:52,775
but I just want to make sure we're on the same page

99
00:04:52,815 --> 00:04:53,515
on a couple things.

100
00:04:54,856 --> 00:04:56,756
As a teacher, I used to always ask my students,

101
00:04:56,816 --> 00:04:59,196
especially our freshman students, what is a crit?

102
00:04:59,556 --> 00:05:00,977
Because that's what we call it in art school,

103
00:05:00,997 --> 00:05:02,177
we call it a crit, we don't call it,

104
00:05:02,517 --> 00:05:03,657
and I said, what is a crit?

105
00:05:03,977 --> 00:05:05,177
What is this thing short for

106
00:05:05,197 --> 00:05:06,258
that we're about to engage on?

107
00:05:06,678 --> 00:05:07,878
And many of them didn't know.

108
00:05:08,078 --> 00:05:09,878
Many thought it was, well, is it short for criticize?

109
00:05:10,038 --> 00:05:10,558
Some thought that.

110
00:05:11,159 --> 00:05:13,220
Some thought it was short for critique.

111
00:05:15,701 --> 00:05:18,382
And for me, it's a very important distinction

112
00:05:19,002 --> 00:05:19,703
between those two words.

113
00:05:19,723 --> 00:05:22,284
And it gave us a chance at the very beginning

114
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,005
of their semester, at the very beginning of their freshman

115
00:05:24,025 --> 00:05:25,745
year, or sometimes in their senior year

116
00:05:25,765 --> 00:05:26,646
when this would come up even.

117
00:05:27,486 --> 00:05:29,467
What is that difference and why is it important?

118
00:05:29,947 --> 00:05:31,628
Well, to criticize from my point of view

119
00:05:31,648 --> 00:05:33,029
is about more personal preference.

120
00:05:33,309 --> 00:05:34,930
It's about being more judgmental.

121
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:36,290
It's about a first response.

122
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:37,191
It's very surface.

123
00:05:38,023 --> 00:05:38,983
It's very subjective.

124
00:05:39,744 --> 00:05:42,366
Whereas critique is much more objective.

125
00:05:43,146 --> 00:05:44,607
It's about being more analytical.

126
00:05:44,627 --> 00:05:47,489
It's about taking a thing apart, looking at all its parts,

127
00:05:47,709 --> 00:05:48,990
finding out how they work together,

128
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,871
and then maybe trying to put it back together again.

129
00:05:51,231 --> 00:05:51,991
That's critique.

130
00:05:52,352 --> 00:05:52,872
And you know what?

131
00:05:53,512 --> 00:05:55,153
Critique doesn't even need to be judgmental.

132
00:05:55,914 --> 00:05:57,835
You don't even need to be judgmental to have

133
00:05:57,855 --> 00:05:58,575
a great critique.

134
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:01,037
If you take something apart and understand how it works,

135
00:06:01,517 --> 00:06:04,839
you've served a great, that's a very valuable act.

136
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:10,977
But you can also then be reflective on that process and in being reflective start to think

137
00:06:11,017 --> 00:06:14,538
how is this thing working in the ways it can, how is it not being working in ways it should

138
00:06:14,958 --> 00:06:18,219
and then you can start to be not so much judgmental as assessing.

139
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,759
How is this thing working?

140
00:06:20,239 --> 00:06:25,060
And that's where the judgments come out of but those judgments are then based on a foundation

141
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,641
of knowing the thing on its own terms.

142
00:06:27,321 --> 00:06:28,703
That's critique, right?

143
00:06:29,023 --> 00:06:30,745
That's very different than criticism.

144
00:06:30,985 --> 00:06:33,849
And as I talk about critique throughout the rest of my talk

145
00:06:33,889 --> 00:06:35,711
today, that's the type of activity

146
00:06:35,731 --> 00:06:37,713
that I'll be thinking about and referring to.

147
00:06:38,133 --> 00:06:39,195
One last thing from last year.

148
00:06:39,956 --> 00:06:41,698
We often think of critical conversations

149
00:06:42,038 --> 00:06:43,419
as being a kind of one-way street,

150
00:06:43,760 --> 00:06:45,081
going from giver to receiver.

151
00:06:45,402 --> 00:06:46,982
And I think that's very much not the case

152
00:06:47,222 --> 00:06:48,162
if it's a two-way street.

153
00:06:48,322 --> 00:06:49,523
Everyone needs to be involved.

154
00:06:49,863 --> 00:06:52,063
Everyone is responsible for how the conversation goes.

155
00:06:52,344 --> 00:06:53,624
If you're receiving the information,

156
00:06:53,644 --> 00:06:55,524
you need to figure out how you're receiving it well

157
00:06:55,845 --> 00:06:57,805
and what you can do to improve that information

158
00:06:57,825 --> 00:06:58,605
you might be receiving.

159
00:06:58,865 --> 00:07:00,526
I covered a lot of that in my talk last year.

160
00:07:00,886 --> 00:07:03,967
And if you're giving the information,

161
00:07:04,147 --> 00:07:05,447
you also need to be thinking about

162
00:07:05,527 --> 00:07:06,888
how is this person receiving it?

163
00:07:07,268 --> 00:07:09,128
Am I presenting it in a way that's the best,

164
00:07:09,388 --> 00:07:11,469
that will help them understand it most clearly?

165
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:15,292
And so you need to be thinking about how your work will be received.

166
00:07:15,493 --> 00:07:20,177
Let me give you a quick example about a time at Harmonix where I wasn't doing that as well

167
00:07:20,217 --> 00:07:21,859
and we needed, it became a problem.

168
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:26,583
That was in the early days of Fantasia Music Evolved, we created all of these gray box

169
00:07:26,643 --> 00:07:30,527
layouts which we found a really fast way, just literally using gray boxes, to create

170
00:07:30,567 --> 00:07:33,049
them in engine so we could really be experiencing them with the Kinect.

171
00:07:33,329 --> 00:07:36,913
And it was great for us, but nobody outside our team could understand what the hell we

172
00:07:36,933 --> 00:07:37,473
were showing them.

173
00:07:38,016 --> 00:07:38,957
It was completely abstract.

174
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:39,897
We knew it, but they didn't.

175
00:07:40,238 --> 00:07:42,940
And so we couldn't get good critical feedback from them because they didn't know what they

176
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:43,440
were looking at.

177
00:07:43,740 --> 00:07:48,204
So we had to make sure we brought in a concept artist to do a wonderful draw over on them

178
00:07:48,384 --> 00:07:51,146
so that it became clear, and then we could start getting great feedback because people

179
00:07:51,186 --> 00:07:52,327
understood what they were looking at.

180
00:07:52,827 --> 00:07:56,710
But just a quick example to talk about this idea of thinking from the other person's point

181
00:07:56,750 --> 00:07:57,070
of view.

182
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:01,073
How are they going to be receiving your information, and have you given them enough information

183
00:08:01,093 --> 00:08:05,156
so that they can understand it in order to give you some good critical feedback?

184
00:08:06,322 --> 00:08:11,985
Which brings me to the big theme of, not the day,

185
00:08:12,005 --> 00:08:13,345
I don't know how the rest of your day has been,

186
00:08:13,545 --> 00:08:18,728
the big theme of this hour, and that theme is empathy.

187
00:08:19,769 --> 00:08:21,790
You need to be empathic when you,

188
00:08:22,490 --> 00:08:25,031
oh see this is John, and that's not empathy.

189
00:08:26,069 --> 00:08:26,549
That's not it.

190
00:08:26,830 --> 00:08:27,330
That's wrong.

191
00:08:27,991 --> 00:08:31,937
Empathy is not being overly sympathetic,

192
00:08:32,297 --> 00:08:34,300
caring about someone, bleeding heart.

193
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:35,221
Those things are important.

194
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:36,703
We have those sort of a role in our life,

195
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:37,804
but that's not empathy.

196
00:08:38,763 --> 00:08:39,664
It's not empathy at all.

197
00:08:40,764 --> 00:08:42,166
So that raises, what is empathy?

198
00:08:42,986 --> 00:08:45,268
Empathy is the ability to imagine

199
00:08:45,648 --> 00:08:46,889
from another point of view.

200
00:08:47,850 --> 00:08:49,611
So if you think, you know, John here,

201
00:08:49,631 --> 00:08:52,073
he is thinking about this, the person in the painting,

202
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:53,915
in their world, in the world of that person,

203
00:08:54,195 --> 00:08:55,356
how would they see other people?

204
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,857
What would those other people look like?

205
00:08:57,258 --> 00:08:58,258
Trying to see from that point of view,

206
00:08:58,278 --> 00:09:00,880
but however, we can't ever really fully do that.

207
00:09:01,841 --> 00:09:05,144
We try to do that, our imagination is blurry,

208
00:09:05,304 --> 00:09:05,965
the image we have.

209
00:09:07,135 --> 00:09:08,316
Often it's even missing pieces.

210
00:09:08,336 --> 00:09:10,418
We try to see something from someone else's point of view.

211
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:13,380
And that's an important part of empathic communication.

212
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:15,222
Because when we realize that we're trying to see

213
00:09:15,242 --> 00:09:16,263
from another person's point of view

214
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:17,884
and we are failing to do that,

215
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:19,185
there are holes in our image,

216
00:09:19,586 --> 00:09:21,728
we are then in an inquisitive mindset.

217
00:09:22,108 --> 00:09:23,869
Because now we're ready to start asking them questions

218
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:25,331
to fill in those missing holes.

219
00:09:26,051 --> 00:09:28,213
That's the core of empathic communication.

220
00:09:28,694 --> 00:09:31,476
Trying to imagine and trying to improve that image

221
00:09:32,077 --> 00:09:34,098
through the act of engaging with another person.

222
00:09:37,293 --> 00:09:39,834
And so in the course of preparing for this talk,

223
00:09:40,194 --> 00:09:41,835
I spent some time talking to many

224
00:09:41,855 --> 00:09:43,656
of the different departments at Harmonics.

225
00:09:44,857 --> 00:09:47,258
And my goal was to find out,

226
00:09:47,698 --> 00:09:50,620
how do we feel we are perceived by others?

227
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:55,423
Because often that perception shows some of the,

228
00:09:57,064 --> 00:10:02,409
some of the ways in which we are misperceived by others, the ways in which we are seen that we don't care to be seen by others,

229
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,231
that are actually false,

230
00:10:04,812 --> 00:10:09,076
the kinds of ways that are not good to think about when we actually enter into a conversation.

231
00:10:09,136 --> 00:10:12,740
So here are a few of those that I found as I talked to people around harmonics.

232
00:10:13,421 --> 00:10:16,924
The artist often felt that people feel it takes us too long to make our work.

233
00:10:17,605 --> 00:10:21,048
The designers often felt that they just are creating work for others.

234
00:10:21,068 --> 00:10:25,231
They don't feel that way themselves, that's how they feel other people see them in a pejorative

235
00:10:25,251 --> 00:10:25,451
way.

236
00:10:26,072 --> 00:10:31,516
The producers felt that people think they don't care about quality, that they only care

237
00:10:31,556 --> 00:10:32,357
about the deliverable.

238
00:10:33,298 --> 00:10:36,601
Programmers felt that sometimes people think they just are there to kill good ideas.

239
00:10:38,042 --> 00:10:42,586
QA said, you know, sometimes we feel that people think that we're just unskilled slackers.

240
00:10:45,082 --> 00:10:50,086
people in operations and in my course of talking to people in harmonics, at one point I realized,

241
00:10:50,126 --> 00:10:52,768
wait a minute, I've been talking to a lot of people who are involved in my initial team,

242
00:10:52,808 --> 00:10:56,652
the creative process, but there's a lot of other people in this company that I also involve

243
00:10:56,692 --> 00:10:59,034
in critical feedback on, critical feedback on different levels.

244
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:02,877
In operations there's one of them, people in the IT department, people who are admins,

245
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:04,478
they deal with critical feedback all the time.

246
00:11:04,499 --> 00:11:06,480
Let me bring them into this conversation also.

247
00:11:07,601 --> 00:11:10,904
And they felt that, you know, other people often see them as people who do things that

248
00:11:10,924 --> 00:11:12,025
are trivial and easy.

249
00:11:13,178 --> 00:11:17,821
And the executives often felt that people see them as just giving disruptive directives.

250
00:11:18,302 --> 00:11:21,484
They want to just be helpful, but when they say something, people think, oh, it came from

251
00:11:21,524 --> 00:11:22,004
an executive.

252
00:11:22,044 --> 00:11:24,085
We've got to stop everything and just do that.

253
00:11:24,806 --> 00:11:29,148
And that's the way in which they feel that they're misrepresented in the way that people

254
00:11:29,188 --> 00:11:29,508
see them.

255
00:11:29,869 --> 00:11:32,390
Now, so these are the ways that often people feel that they are seen.

256
00:11:32,810 --> 00:11:34,632
which probably shows there's some kind of truth in there,

257
00:11:34,652 --> 00:11:36,533
probably means a lot of people do see people that way.

258
00:11:36,933 --> 00:11:38,414
And if that is the case,

259
00:11:39,055 --> 00:11:42,137
and if we go into a conversation with someone from QA,

260
00:11:42,397 --> 00:11:44,239
with a designer, with an executive,

261
00:11:44,479 --> 00:11:46,320
and we have this notion in mind.

262
00:11:48,115 --> 00:11:50,257
no empathic communication is gonna happen.

263
00:11:50,317 --> 00:11:52,119
Empathic communication has already failed.

264
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,500
We've already failed to have

265
00:11:53,520 --> 00:11:55,202
a really productive conversation.

266
00:11:55,542 --> 00:11:57,864
But rather, we should start thinking about

267
00:11:57,965 --> 00:11:59,046
how people wanna be seen.

268
00:11:59,086 --> 00:12:00,567
So it was my second question I asked people

269
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,688
when I was talking with them.

270
00:12:02,109 --> 00:12:03,950
How do you wanna be seen by people, other people?

271
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:05,072
And the artist said, you know,

272
00:12:05,112 --> 00:12:07,374
we wanna think in terms of aesthetics and experience.

273
00:12:08,903 --> 00:12:10,404
and the designers said, well, we are really able

274
00:12:10,624 --> 00:12:12,385
to help contextualize our work.

275
00:12:12,466 --> 00:12:14,747
You know, these are the ways that people wanna be seen.

276
00:12:15,027 --> 00:12:16,068
They're also the things that people

277
00:12:16,088 --> 00:12:17,309
from different departments feel they bring

278
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:20,792
their unique perspective to the creative effort.

279
00:12:21,232 --> 00:12:23,654
The producers said, you know, we really facilitate process,

280
00:12:23,674 --> 00:12:25,015
we want people to see that in us.

281
00:12:25,575 --> 00:12:28,137
The programmers said, we want people to realize

282
00:12:28,177 --> 00:12:29,478
that we think in terms of systems,

283
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:31,420
and it's a really unique and special way of thinking

284
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:33,501
that is helpful for everyone to understand.

285
00:12:34,382 --> 00:12:37,544
QA said, we want people to understand that we actually have a robust understanding of

286
00:12:37,584 --> 00:12:41,768
the game across all disciplines, so we're a great resource for everyone to really help

287
00:12:42,068 --> 00:12:44,710
understand how things function in lots of different ways.

288
00:12:45,371 --> 00:12:48,774
Operations said, we really work to create a better work environment so that everyone

289
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:50,315
can be working more efficiently.

290
00:12:50,835 --> 00:12:55,459
And the executives said that we enjoy contributing to the process, and we want people to understand

291
00:12:55,499 --> 00:12:55,679
that.

292
00:12:55,939 --> 00:12:57,821
We want people to understand that we're just contributors.

293
00:12:58,061 --> 00:13:00,363
We aren't actually being directive necessarily.

294
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:02,905
Sometimes we have to be directive, and we need to find ways to clarify that.

295
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:04,906
as the executives told me.

296
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,887
So these are ways that people want to be seen.

297
00:13:09,447 --> 00:13:12,048
And if we can go into our conversations thinking that way,

298
00:13:12,248 --> 00:13:13,749
how does this person wanna be seen

299
00:13:14,029 --> 00:13:15,389
and seeing them in that light,

300
00:13:15,690 --> 00:13:18,630
then right away a lot of the empathic communication

301
00:13:18,691 --> 00:13:19,751
is gonna take care of itself.

302
00:13:21,590 --> 00:13:25,092
Because empathic communication is vital to everything I'm going to talk about over the

303
00:13:25,112 --> 00:13:25,733
next rest hour.

304
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:29,735
It's vital to efficient critical feedback.

305
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:32,917
It's vital to communicating across disciplines.

306
00:13:34,178 --> 00:13:34,878
But there is a shortcut.

307
00:13:35,258 --> 00:13:39,241
So get this and then you can, if you leave, no don't leave.

308
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,863
But here's the shortcut that is really helpful, that will also help kind of go over all the

309
00:13:42,883 --> 00:13:44,064
other strategies I'm going to talk about.

310
00:13:44,324 --> 00:13:49,327
And that is that remember the behavior is shaped by a wish to be respected, be heard,

311
00:13:50,047 --> 00:13:50,708
and be valued.

312
00:13:54,462 --> 00:14:01,886
One of the things that used to really annoy me and scrape against me when I'd hear teachers

313
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:07,148
do it when I was a student or hear of other teachers doing it when I was a teacher in

314
00:14:07,188 --> 00:14:10,810
art school was they would say to the students, okay, we're going to have a critique today.

315
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:12,511
You've got to leave your ego at the door.

316
00:14:15,607 --> 00:14:16,988
In some context that might work.

317
00:14:17,589 --> 00:14:19,210
If it's a context in which that teacher

318
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:21,312
has given those students strategies

319
00:14:21,512 --> 00:14:23,494
to effectively leave there, he goes at the door.

320
00:14:23,754 --> 00:14:25,176
But often that's not the case.

321
00:14:25,616 --> 00:14:27,758
Often they're just putting the whole onus on the student.

322
00:14:28,238 --> 00:14:30,200
And here's why I hated that.

323
00:14:30,841 --> 00:14:32,202
I don't use the word hate lightly.

324
00:14:32,582 --> 00:14:34,664
I really disliked that because.

325
00:14:36,262 --> 00:14:39,423
it put the students in a position where now, you know, we care about our work.

326
00:14:39,523 --> 00:14:40,543
Everyone cares about their work.

327
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:43,684
It is hard to hear that your work isn't working well.

328
00:14:44,364 --> 00:14:45,785
Right. That's the case for everyone.

329
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,846
You know, if you look if that makes you

330
00:14:47,886 --> 00:14:52,107
feel giddy to hear that your work stinks, then you're some weird exception.

331
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:53,328
And but.

332
00:14:54,108 --> 00:14:56,270
So it hurts, right? That's just the way it is.

333
00:14:56,531 --> 00:14:59,694
Now, if you have been told you need to leave the ego at the door, what's going to happen?

334
00:15:00,114 --> 00:15:03,859
You hear your work isn't working efficiently, and now you feel bad because your work is failing,

335
00:15:04,059 --> 00:15:06,702
but you also feel bad because you're feeling bad.

336
00:15:07,554 --> 00:15:07,774
Right?

337
00:15:08,034 --> 00:15:09,435
Oh, shit, I'm supposed to leave my ego at the door.

338
00:15:09,495 --> 00:15:10,356
Everyone else here can do it.

339
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:11,356
The teacher told me I should do it.

340
00:15:11,657 --> 00:15:12,437
I shouldn't feel bad.

341
00:15:12,617 --> 00:15:13,778
And now I feel bad about feeling bad.

342
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,319
And my brain is all in this.

343
00:15:15,359 --> 00:15:16,259
And guess what I'm not hearing?

344
00:15:16,279 --> 00:15:18,721
I am not hearing the feedback.

345
00:15:19,261 --> 00:15:20,161
It's not coming through.

346
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:21,642
It's not being communicated.

347
00:15:22,123 --> 00:15:26,985
And so these things aren't just about being a bleeding heart.

348
00:15:27,186 --> 00:15:28,646
Oh, we've got to care about people's feelings.

349
00:15:28,666 --> 00:15:31,148
We've got to think about them, which is true.

350
00:15:32,248 --> 00:15:33,809
But that's not the reason for this.

351
00:15:33,869 --> 00:15:35,170
The reason for this is if we're not

352
00:15:35,250 --> 00:15:36,231
thinking about these things.

353
00:15:37,337 --> 00:15:41,761
If we're not validating people and making them feel heard, then they will be unable

354
00:15:41,801 --> 00:15:45,124
to hear the really vital feedback that we need to give them.

355
00:15:45,945 --> 00:15:50,489
When you do this, you can be harsher in your critique than you can if you don't, than

356
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:51,610
you are able to if you don't.

357
00:15:52,050 --> 00:15:53,191
So this isn't about just being nice.

358
00:15:53,452 --> 00:15:57,095
It's actually about being harsh in your critiques and rough in your critiques, but having the

359
00:15:57,155 --> 00:15:59,918
foundation upon which that can be accepted and understood.

360
00:16:02,078 --> 00:16:06,059
So we're going to talk about two different strategies, two different areas of strategy,

361
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:08,560
types of strategies over the rest of the talk.

362
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,941
I'm going to divide it into kind of two parts.

363
00:16:10,341 --> 00:16:13,402
One part will be things we can do before the conversations that involve critical feedback,

364
00:16:13,722 --> 00:16:17,464
and then it'll be about things we can do during the actual conversations themselves.

365
00:16:18,704 --> 00:16:23,026
So before the conversations, I'm going to kind of go over three types of strategy areas

366
00:16:23,066 --> 00:16:27,628
that we can do before we have these conversations to help lay the groundwork for effective communication.

367
00:16:28,614 --> 00:16:30,656
One is we can create inclusive structures.

368
00:16:30,956 --> 00:16:31,957
So these are things that can happen more

369
00:16:31,977 --> 00:16:34,939
on a structural level within a company.

370
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:38,402
One is we can start to have kickoff meetings

371
00:16:38,462 --> 00:16:39,302
as part of our structure

372
00:16:39,322 --> 00:16:40,623
for whenever we're working together.

373
00:16:42,044 --> 00:16:43,546
There was a time when we were working

374
00:16:43,626 --> 00:16:46,428
on Fantasia and Music Evolved

375
00:16:46,828 --> 00:16:49,230
where the concept artists were down the hall

376
00:16:49,490 --> 00:16:51,431
and they were making these amazingly beautiful

377
00:16:51,472 --> 00:16:53,013
concept artists, drawings,

378
00:16:53,073 --> 00:16:54,654
and they were working with a narrative designer.

379
00:16:56,157 --> 00:16:59,919
And at the other end of the hall, those of us who were on the environment team were doing

380
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:04,860
more rapid prototyping of gameplay ideas with the gameplay designers.

381
00:17:05,701 --> 00:17:08,702
And we had never talked to each other really clearly at the beginning.

382
00:17:08,762 --> 00:17:11,322
So the design, the narrative, actually let me pause for a minute.

383
00:17:11,583 --> 00:17:15,864
One thing this example also shows is interdisciplinarity often is within disciplines itself.

384
00:17:16,384 --> 00:17:22,533
right? The concept artists, modelers, and technical artists, even within art there's

385
00:17:22,573 --> 00:17:26,038
lots of different disciplines involved and the same is true I know of other departments.

386
00:17:26,872 --> 00:17:31,155
But in this case, we had designers, one type of designer down the hall with the narrative and the concept artist,

387
00:17:31,415 --> 00:17:34,737
another type of designer down the other end of the hall with us on the environment team,

388
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,518
and we were all doing this wonderful work.

389
00:17:36,738 --> 00:17:40,060
We were making these great interactive toys, interactive environments,

390
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,661
that had all these wonderful rules about how you had to interact with them,

391
00:17:43,082 --> 00:17:46,243
and the people down the hall were designing all these wonderful, beautiful art things,

392
00:17:46,464 --> 00:17:48,185
but we weren't talking to each other clearly.

393
00:17:48,525 --> 00:17:49,545
And there started to be a lot of tension,

394
00:17:49,565 --> 00:17:51,586
like who is driving this cart here?

395
00:17:51,886 --> 00:17:53,227
Are we supposed to be listening to them

396
00:17:53,287 --> 00:17:54,227
in driving our gameplay?

397
00:17:54,507 --> 00:17:55,628
Are they supposed to be listening to us

398
00:17:55,688 --> 00:17:57,668
and doing narratives that overlay the gameplay?

399
00:17:58,249 --> 00:18:00,350
And it would be possible to work in parallel,

400
00:18:00,370 --> 00:18:01,850
but in this case we really started to diverge

401
00:18:01,890 --> 00:18:03,311
and we started to have tension with each other

402
00:18:03,651 --> 00:18:05,152
because we never had a kickoff meeting.

403
00:18:05,392 --> 00:18:06,932
Say, who is responsible for what?

404
00:18:07,272 --> 00:18:08,353
How are we gonna be doing this?

405
00:18:08,593 --> 00:18:10,394
How are we gonna be working in parallel successfully?

406
00:18:10,594 --> 00:18:12,575
It hadn't been defined and it created a lot of tension.

407
00:18:13,195 --> 00:18:14,095
that was unnecessary.

408
00:18:14,776 --> 00:18:18,377
And what also would have happened, or would have been helpful for us, would have been

409
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:21,279
if we could have had a regular communication throughout that process.

410
00:18:21,939 --> 00:18:25,601
If we would have been meeting regularly to talk about how things were going, so we could

411
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,502
kind of stay in the loop with each other's work.

412
00:18:27,922 --> 00:18:31,563
And one great way to do that would have been to have regular group critiques.

413
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:33,965
Group critiques are a great way.

414
00:18:36,002 --> 00:18:39,002
to share work, but they need to be part of the structure.

415
00:18:39,702 --> 00:18:42,063
And what's even better is if you can have a structure

416
00:18:42,083 --> 00:18:43,183
for the group critique itself,

417
00:18:43,203 --> 00:18:45,023
so you're not just throwing people into the water

418
00:18:45,043 --> 00:18:45,984
and asking them to swim.

419
00:18:46,544 --> 00:18:48,224
What I'm gonna share with you now over a couple minutes

420
00:18:48,704 --> 00:18:52,005
is a technique that I found incredibly helpful as a teacher

421
00:18:52,785 --> 00:18:54,685
and there might be parts of it you can pull

422
00:18:54,966 --> 00:18:56,826
to use in the studio environment.

423
00:18:56,846 --> 00:18:58,706
I've used it successfully in the studio environment

424
00:18:58,746 --> 00:18:59,626
harmonics many times.

425
00:19:01,047 --> 00:19:02,727
But it's one way to do critique.

426
00:19:03,327 --> 00:19:06,630
The reason I'm presenting this to you is it gives you the example of a way to structure

427
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:06,971
critique.

428
00:19:07,151 --> 00:19:08,612
It is by no means the only way.

429
00:19:08,893 --> 00:19:12,636
You need to find your way that works best for you and your context.

430
00:19:12,816 --> 00:19:15,739
But I just wanted to share with you once, you understand the idea of what it means to

431
00:19:15,759 --> 00:19:16,379
structure critique.

432
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,181
And this is a pretty rigid way of doing it, to be frank.

433
00:19:18,662 --> 00:19:21,945
This way of structuring critique has two parts.

434
00:19:22,245 --> 00:19:24,167
Part one, you've got to get to know the damn thing, right?

435
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:26,628
All too often, when we go to critique something,

436
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:27,508
we start talking right away.

437
00:19:27,548 --> 00:19:30,469
We feel a need to start judging it or assessing it right away.

438
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:32,670
But that doesn't make sense.

439
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:33,451
You don't do that.

440
00:19:34,011 --> 00:19:37,132
You meet someone, and as you're shaking their hand,

441
00:19:37,152 --> 00:19:39,613
you say, gosh, I really think you're not a very nice person.

442
00:19:40,273 --> 00:19:43,295
Or, gosh, you don't judge that person right away.

443
00:19:43,595 --> 00:19:44,675
We realize we've got to get to know them.

444
00:19:44,915 --> 00:19:47,096
The same is true before we give the critical feedback.

445
00:19:47,336 --> 00:19:48,897
And here are the steps that I do in this process

446
00:19:49,117 --> 00:19:49,597
to get to know it.

447
00:19:49,657 --> 00:19:52,958
First, we spend some time just describing it objectively.

448
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:58,904
This water bottle is about four and a half inches tall.

449
00:20:00,125 --> 00:20:01,767
It's about two inches in diameter.

450
00:20:02,327 --> 00:20:03,288
It's clear plastic.

451
00:20:03,528 --> 00:20:05,950
Just the basic objective qualities that are there.

452
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:07,191
What's the purpose of this?

453
00:20:07,732 --> 00:20:11,214
It gives us some time to not be judgmental.

454
00:20:12,375 --> 00:20:13,416
Not judgmental at all.

455
00:20:13,756 --> 00:20:17,219
It buys some time to just be with the damn thing

456
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:18,680
and just look at it.

457
00:20:19,462 --> 00:20:21,783
and not think about whether we like it or not.

458
00:20:21,803 --> 00:20:22,403
We're just with it.

459
00:20:22,943 --> 00:20:26,004
Second part, describe your subjective reactions to it.

460
00:20:26,664 --> 00:20:27,784
Gosh, when I look at this water bottle,

461
00:20:27,804 --> 00:20:31,465
it makes me feel a little thirsty, which is good,

462
00:20:31,485 --> 00:20:32,345
because I can drink out of it.

463
00:20:33,065 --> 00:20:34,146
When I look at this water bottle,

464
00:20:34,386 --> 00:20:38,367
I think it makes me feel big, because it's

465
00:20:38,587 --> 00:20:39,707
smaller than a regular water bottle.

466
00:20:39,727 --> 00:20:40,587
It's making me feel big.

467
00:20:41,207 --> 00:20:42,407
That's raising these issues of scale.

468
00:20:42,588 --> 00:20:43,728
So I'm just starting to describe.

469
00:20:43,908 --> 00:20:47,629
And again, non-judgmentally, what's happening inside of me?

470
00:20:47,809 --> 00:20:48,789
When I look at this water bottle.

471
00:20:49,469 --> 00:20:52,191
It reminds me of the water bottle they used somewhere,

472
00:20:52,211 --> 00:20:53,893
sort of in art, that makes more sense, right?

473
00:20:53,913 --> 00:20:55,374
When I look at this, when I'm looking at this,

474
00:20:55,394 --> 00:20:58,476
it reminds me of an Andy Warhol painting or something, right?

475
00:20:59,077 --> 00:21:00,278
What's happening inside my brain,

476
00:21:00,298 --> 00:21:01,399
what's happening inside my body,

477
00:21:01,619 --> 00:21:02,860
just describing it objectively.

478
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:04,161
Again, getting to know it,

479
00:21:04,181 --> 00:21:05,522
getting to know it on its own terms.

480
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:06,563
What is that thing doing?

481
00:21:06,603 --> 00:21:08,244
Before I try to judge it or assess it,

482
00:21:08,885 --> 00:21:10,226
then part two, analyze it.

483
00:21:11,850 --> 00:21:13,150
Begin by analyzing, by finding out,

484
00:21:13,190 --> 00:21:14,150
what's the goal of this thing?

485
00:21:14,731 --> 00:21:15,711
What was it trying to achieve?

486
00:21:15,771 --> 00:21:17,512
You know, that might be a larger goal

487
00:21:17,872 --> 00:21:20,352
within the art direction or within the gameplay.

488
00:21:20,573 --> 00:21:21,553
What's the goal of this thing?

489
00:21:22,393 --> 00:21:24,534
Second part, what were the maker's intentions?

490
00:21:24,834 --> 00:21:26,715
How was the maker trying to achieve that goal?

491
00:21:26,775 --> 00:21:28,115
What were they trying to do with this?

492
00:21:28,575 --> 00:21:31,296
And now, you've got all the parts you need.

493
00:21:31,976 --> 00:21:34,557
You now have experience, you've taken the thing apart,

494
00:21:34,617 --> 00:21:35,457
you spent time with it,

495
00:21:35,477 --> 00:21:36,918
you understand how it works on its own terms,

496
00:21:37,258 --> 00:21:37,918
and now you have...

497
00:21:38,772 --> 00:21:40,852
the objective criteria you can use to assess it.

498
00:21:41,072 --> 00:21:41,893
And that's the last thing.

499
00:21:42,613 --> 00:21:45,494
How does it work to achieve its goals or fall short?

500
00:21:46,514 --> 00:21:47,235
Now you can do that.

501
00:21:47,395 --> 00:21:50,756
That, for me, a great process of critique

502
00:21:50,796 --> 00:21:52,997
that's worked really well for me for many, many years

503
00:21:53,817 --> 00:21:54,657
and has had great success.

504
00:21:54,857 --> 00:21:57,438
But one key word here is that word how.

505
00:21:58,772 --> 00:22:01,893
Not just is it achieving its goals or is it falling short,

506
00:22:02,334 --> 00:22:04,194
how is it falling short, right?

507
00:22:04,475 --> 00:22:06,156
What are the ways it's doing that?

508
00:22:06,836 --> 00:22:08,357
Again, it gets an idea of assessing it

509
00:22:08,597 --> 00:22:11,238
and really figuring out how it's working on its own terms

510
00:22:11,498 --> 00:22:12,519
and by its own system.

511
00:22:15,235 --> 00:22:19,598
Final way that we can be inclusive on a structural level in our companies is by brainstorming,

512
00:22:20,639 --> 00:22:25,262
bringing people from diverse departments and disciplines in together to brainstorm around

513
00:22:25,282 --> 00:22:26,703
a problem to get all of their points of view.

514
00:22:26,723 --> 00:22:30,846
If that's part of the structure, things can go really, really well and really efficient

515
00:22:30,866 --> 00:22:35,089
and everyone gets buy-in and feels like they're part of the same, solving the same problem.

516
00:22:35,109 --> 00:22:37,090
This worked really well in the Beatles.

517
00:22:38,411 --> 00:22:41,434
in the Rock Band Beatles game where they had to create all these wonderful

518
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:47,099
dreamscapes and so they detected there was all kinds of limitations.

519
00:22:47,119 --> 00:22:50,421
So they brought artists and engineers and the designers and everyone got into a room

520
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:54,324
and they started to brainstorm solutions and before long they came up with a great way

521
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:55,966
that became a really successful solution.

522
00:22:56,166 --> 00:23:00,169
But it worked really well because everyone from all the different disciplines was in

523
00:23:00,229 --> 00:23:02,391
right away and had a stake in it.

524
00:23:02,451 --> 00:23:04,473
They had been involved in making that decision.

525
00:23:06,255 --> 00:23:08,515
So we talked about some ways to create inclusive structures

526
00:23:08,535 --> 00:23:09,816
that we can do before a conversation.

527
00:23:09,856 --> 00:23:11,096
And those are things that often happen

528
00:23:11,116 --> 00:23:12,196
to happen on a structural level.

529
00:23:12,577 --> 00:23:14,037
But now we're gonna spend some time talking about ways

530
00:23:14,077 --> 00:23:15,718
we can prepare before the conversation

531
00:23:15,938 --> 00:23:16,718
that are more individual.

532
00:23:17,778 --> 00:23:19,559
Maybe I'm not in a position that I can change

533
00:23:19,579 --> 00:23:20,639
the structure of my company,

534
00:23:20,879 --> 00:23:22,480
but there are things I can do individually

535
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,660
that will help these conversations go well

536
00:23:24,920 --> 00:23:26,561
before the conversations even take place.

537
00:23:27,481 --> 00:23:28,981
One is by researching ahead of time.

538
00:23:29,501 --> 00:23:32,162
This is something that I still continue to this day

539
00:23:32,222 --> 00:23:36,723
to work on, which is before I go ask an engineer, hey,

540
00:23:36,743 --> 00:23:38,243
you've got this problem with the shader graph.

541
00:23:38,263 --> 00:23:38,804
Can you help me?

542
00:23:39,264 --> 00:23:41,284
Spending 10 minutes, half an hour,

543
00:23:41,604 --> 00:23:43,485
doing some research on my own, maybe

544
00:23:43,505 --> 00:23:45,545
I can find the actual answer and not have to bother him.

545
00:23:46,045 --> 00:23:48,786
Or at least I now understand the vocabulary that's

546
00:23:48,806 --> 00:23:49,746
specifically related.

547
00:23:49,806 --> 00:23:51,026
So if he starts talking about, oh, you

548
00:23:51,046 --> 00:23:52,107
need to use a dot product there.

549
00:23:52,407 --> 00:23:53,467
Now I've done some research.

550
00:23:53,487 --> 00:23:54,287
I know what a dot product is.

551
00:23:54,307 --> 00:23:55,387
I don't have to have him explain that.

552
00:23:55,427 --> 00:23:56,888
So I've done some background on myself.

553
00:23:57,348 --> 00:24:00,669
of myself ahead of time, it's going to help the whole conversation go well.

554
00:24:01,249 --> 00:24:03,370
Another is preparing with quick prototypes.

555
00:24:04,290 --> 00:24:09,272
This is a prototype I made for the early versions of Harmonix Music VR for the trip sequence

556
00:24:09,292 --> 00:24:10,252
that involves kaleidoscopes.

557
00:24:10,312 --> 00:24:13,813
I just slammed together some tech we already had just to see how kaleidoscopes felt.

558
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:19,175
We knew it worked, it helped us see that it worked really well before we went into critiquing

559
00:24:19,235 --> 00:24:23,437
it and then we were able to build out the systems we needed to create this more complex

560
00:24:23,717 --> 00:24:25,718
kaleidoscopic system that was in the shipping.

561
00:24:27,533 --> 00:24:32,816
experience. Another way that we compare ahead of time

562
00:24:32,856 --> 00:24:37,539
is with visualizations. This worked really well as I was working on UI on Sync Space.

563
00:24:37,819 --> 00:24:42,201
Initially I wanted to make sure we had this tablet which had all kinds of information

564
00:24:42,221 --> 00:24:47,004
that you had to read to choose your songs, to make all kinds of selections. And I wanted

565
00:24:47,044 --> 00:24:48,845
to feel like this machine that could, this like...

566
00:24:49,485 --> 00:24:52,567
wonderful contraption that would open up almost like a Swiss army knife, could unfold and

567
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:53,447
fold back in.

568
00:24:53,768 --> 00:24:57,510
And so I made this paper prototype so I could start showing people really quickly, hey,

569
00:24:57,550 --> 00:24:59,931
here's how I want to imagine it working, here's how I imagine it flipping around.

570
00:25:00,151 --> 00:25:03,353
So we had this visualization we could then talk about, which was really helpful.

571
00:25:04,193 --> 00:25:07,535
Because then we could help the critical feedback go really fast having that.

572
00:25:07,995 --> 00:25:10,076
Then as we continued to work on it.

573
00:25:11,085 --> 00:25:16,731
The designer that was working through this with me, Brian Chan, did these wonderful,

574
00:25:16,831 --> 00:25:21,695
wonderful illustrations whenever he was doing the UI design for it, which were just great

575
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:23,617
and helped us talk about it a lot easier.

576
00:25:24,518 --> 00:25:29,282
And also made it easier for me when I was scrolling down the design document to find

577
00:25:29,402 --> 00:25:31,064
things I wanted to find, because I could see them visually.

578
00:25:31,084 --> 00:25:33,046
I didn't have to skim over a bunch of text.

579
00:25:33,526 --> 00:25:35,828
And those things ended up resulting in this tablet

580
00:25:35,888 --> 00:25:37,529
that we have in seeing space, which

581
00:25:38,109 --> 00:25:40,110
ended up achieving all my goals at the beginning.

582
00:25:40,130 --> 00:25:42,892
It's this fun thing to play with in addition

583
00:25:44,213 --> 00:25:45,014
to being functional.

584
00:25:45,514 --> 00:25:48,576
And that's an objective opinion.

585
00:25:48,676 --> 00:25:49,857
That's an objective fact, actually.

586
00:25:49,937 --> 00:25:52,118
It's not my opinion.

587
00:25:53,459 --> 00:25:54,620
I hope you find it fun to play with.

588
00:25:56,588 --> 00:26:03,735
So another thing we can do is we can prepare by defining problems before we have a critique.

589
00:26:04,395 --> 00:26:07,959
One issue again came up in Sync Space was we had this HUD, which I had fallen in love

590
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:08,099
with.

591
00:26:08,139 --> 00:26:11,582
We wanted to have the HUD as this robot, it would follow you around and all the song lyrics

592
00:26:11,602 --> 00:26:17,308
would be on it, and it was great and interactive, but we realized that it just wasn't working.

593
00:26:17,408 --> 00:26:18,890
So before we had a critique about it.

594
00:26:19,230 --> 00:26:21,551
we realized, OK, what's the problem we're trying to solve?

595
00:26:21,752 --> 00:26:22,632
So we can really focus this.

596
00:26:22,692 --> 00:26:24,894
The problem here was that the HUD needed to be more flexible.

597
00:26:24,914 --> 00:26:27,516
It needed to be able to fit in more specific spaces

598
00:26:27,576 --> 00:26:29,377
rather than dominating the whole space.

599
00:26:29,697 --> 00:26:31,559
And so we were able to, by having that focus

600
00:26:31,879 --> 00:26:33,440
and defining the problem, we were able to really quickly

601
00:26:33,460 --> 00:26:36,202
start talking about solutions for it during the critique

602
00:26:36,222 --> 00:26:37,823
that ended up with this other version of the HUD.

603
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:41,206
It's more like a movie screen or a slide screen

604
00:26:41,246 --> 00:26:43,027
that opens and closes around the space.

605
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:48,663
So a third area of things we can do before the conversation

606
00:26:49,063 --> 00:26:50,505
are we can do things structurally

607
00:26:50,745 --> 00:26:51,886
to help build relationships.

608
00:26:51,906 --> 00:26:53,888
Some of these are structural and some are individual.

609
00:26:55,109 --> 00:26:58,192
One thing we can do is just share your appreciation

610
00:26:58,212 --> 00:26:59,133
and respect for someone.

611
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:01,015
This seems like a little thing, and I almost

612
00:27:01,055 --> 00:27:02,116
didn't even put it in this talk.

613
00:27:02,757 --> 00:27:04,899
But I have a little thing for this.

614
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:06,340
It's when you see something.

615
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:13,004
say something meaning you know if somebody did something that you really

616
00:27:13,044 --> 00:27:16,785
like just let them know you know there's a time I work when we're working on

617
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:21,046
rock band 4 I was working on the crowd figure assets and one of the lead

618
00:27:21,066 --> 00:27:26,127
designers Greg Lepiclio came by and said actually the creative director

619
00:27:26,387 --> 00:27:29,587
whatever I think he's a creative director on that project he said you

620
00:27:29,607 --> 00:27:32,608
know hey Jeff I noticed you were working on those character assets are looking

621
00:27:32,688 --> 00:27:35,249
really wonderful there I really appreciate I was really enjoying them

622
00:27:35,269 --> 00:27:37,829
the other day and that meant a lot to me it was like wow first of all

623
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,231
Greg actually was noticing the crowd.

624
00:27:40,912 --> 00:27:41,493
That's awesome.

625
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,875
And he actually knows what I've been doing.

626
00:27:43,915 --> 00:27:44,456
It meant a lot.

627
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:46,758
But later, when we actually had to have a critique

628
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:47,479
about those crowd assets,

629
00:27:47,539 --> 00:27:49,441
and they actually weren't working as well as we needed,

630
00:27:50,182 --> 00:27:51,583
there was a great foundation for that,

631
00:27:51,643 --> 00:27:53,825
because I knew that Greg was already coming from this place

632
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:54,786
and actually appreciating them.

633
00:27:54,807 --> 00:27:56,188
And so now that they actually weren't doing

634
00:27:56,228 --> 00:27:57,209
what he needed them to do,

635
00:27:57,690 --> 00:27:58,991
it was a lot easier for me to hear that,

636
00:27:59,431 --> 00:28:01,173
because I knew kind of where it was coming from.

637
00:28:01,934 --> 00:28:05,900
So, these things are just little things you can do that help build a relationship so then

638
00:28:05,940 --> 00:28:10,387
when you do need to have critical feedback later, you've already got a strong foundation

639
00:28:10,467 --> 00:28:11,569
for that to happen.

640
00:28:12,230 --> 00:28:13,832
Another is just asking for help.

641
00:28:15,058 --> 00:28:16,239
There's another thing I did recently.

642
00:28:16,479 --> 00:28:18,701
You'd think I would know these things better

643
00:28:18,781 --> 00:28:19,562
since I'm talking about it,

644
00:28:19,582 --> 00:28:20,623
but this is, I did this recently,

645
00:28:20,643 --> 00:28:22,785
a lesson I haven't even fully learned myself,

646
00:28:23,085 --> 00:28:27,990
which was I'd been working in the animation on this project,

647
00:28:28,250 --> 00:28:31,133
and often in Unity, those of you who work in Unity

648
00:28:31,153 --> 00:28:32,294
may know this thing where if you.

649
00:28:33,114 --> 00:28:36,136
If you re-animate something, if you re-parent something

650
00:28:36,176 --> 00:28:37,837
and move it around its hierarchy after you've animated it,

651
00:28:38,117 --> 00:28:40,859
it's broken, the animation keys don't work anymore.

652
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,460
I've been suffering with that for a long time,

653
00:28:42,500 --> 00:28:44,321
complaining about it, but finally I mentioned it

654
00:28:44,361 --> 00:28:46,682
to the engineers on the project,

655
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:50,244
and the lead engineer said, you know what,

656
00:28:50,584 --> 00:28:51,565
we've got a tool to fix that.

657
00:28:52,125 --> 00:28:53,006
It's been there all the time.

658
00:28:53,066 --> 00:28:54,547
I just didn't know, I'd never asked about it.

659
00:28:54,567 --> 00:28:56,688
I hadn't reached out across disciplines to say,

660
00:28:56,728 --> 00:28:58,589
here's this problem I'm solving, can you help me do that?

661
00:28:58,889 --> 00:29:00,010
So here's why this is important,

662
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:02,111
and here's why it's relevant to this talk.

663
00:29:04,002 --> 00:29:06,143
By reaching across disciplines, asking for help,

664
00:29:06,724 --> 00:29:07,504
two things can happen.

665
00:29:07,664 --> 00:29:08,565
One, you can save a lot of time,

666
00:29:08,585 --> 00:29:11,608
because things may already exist to help you, right?

667
00:29:12,048 --> 00:29:14,450
But two, it's another way to build relationships.

668
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:16,391
By doing that now, by helping each other,

669
00:29:16,571 --> 00:29:17,933
we're building stronger relationships.

670
00:29:18,153 --> 00:29:20,214
So when we do need to give critical feedback to each other,

671
00:29:20,815 --> 00:29:22,696
we're doing it on a stronger foundation.

672
00:29:22,816 --> 00:29:26,279
So these are all ways of building relational foundations

673
00:29:26,579 --> 00:29:28,361
so that when we do need to give critical feedback,

674
00:29:28,641 --> 00:29:30,482
we have a much stronger foundation for it.

675
00:29:31,261 --> 00:29:33,583
And the last thing is we can do organized events.

676
00:29:33,603 --> 00:29:34,923
We do a lot of these greater harmonics.

677
00:29:35,123 --> 00:29:36,584
We go bowling together once a year.

678
00:29:36,664 --> 00:29:37,685
We have game jams once a year.

679
00:29:37,705 --> 00:29:40,007
I'm sure you guys do things like that often in other companies.

680
00:29:40,047 --> 00:29:41,488
If you don't, I strongly suggest you do.

681
00:29:41,808 --> 00:29:42,688
But here's why I put it in here.

682
00:29:42,708 --> 00:29:43,669
I put this here, too.

683
00:29:43,689 --> 00:29:44,710
I almost took it out, also.

684
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:47,972
But I put it in here because I was remembering that often,

685
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:51,314
when I go to bowl, I just get so into the bowling and loving it

686
00:29:51,334 --> 00:29:53,916
that I'm forgetting, hey, this is also an opportunity for me

687
00:29:53,956 --> 00:29:54,096
to be.

688
00:29:54,776 --> 00:29:57,599
Meeting a lot of other people in the company that I don't normally meet and talking to a lot of other people

689
00:29:57,619 --> 00:30:02,883
I don't normally talk to and that's what these these things are for and so when your company does these

690
00:30:03,144 --> 00:30:06,486
Really taking full advantage of that and using it a chance to really build relationships

691
00:30:07,227 --> 00:30:09,409
outside of the the ones you usually have

692
00:30:10,510 --> 00:30:13,473
So these are the three things that are really helpful for doing things before

693
00:30:14,233 --> 00:30:15,014
conversation starts

694
00:30:17,329 --> 00:30:20,810
They're not the things, they're some things that are good examples and there are many

695
00:30:20,850 --> 00:30:20,970
more.

696
00:30:20,990 --> 00:30:24,372
It's not an exhaustive list, but some things I thought would be helpful to talk about today.

697
00:30:24,852 --> 00:30:30,035
Now let's pivot a little bit and talk about the second chunk of things, ways of strategies

698
00:30:30,075 --> 00:30:30,555
and techniques.

699
00:30:30,575 --> 00:30:35,998
And that is things we can do during an actual conversation that's involving critical feedback

700
00:30:36,378 --> 00:30:37,159
across disciplines.

701
00:30:38,616 --> 00:30:41,217
And the first thing that's helpful to ask here is

702
00:30:42,078 --> 00:30:43,879
what helps conversations go well in general,

703
00:30:43,959 --> 00:30:47,181
especially conversations when they're across cultures, right?

704
00:30:48,402 --> 00:30:51,143
Well, if we think about it,

705
00:30:51,243 --> 00:30:52,804
when people are communicating,

706
00:30:52,844 --> 00:30:55,746
if there's someone from China negotiating

707
00:30:55,806 --> 00:30:59,628
or having a conversation with someone from the United States

708
00:30:59,748 --> 00:31:02,350
or across cultures, what's really helpful in doing that?

709
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:03,671
That's right.

710
00:31:04,583 --> 00:31:06,463
It's a moderator, right?

711
00:31:06,603 --> 00:31:08,404
Moderators are people who come in

712
00:31:08,704 --> 00:31:11,005
and they help to facilitate empathic communication.

713
00:31:11,285 --> 00:31:13,586
They do that by helping to focus the critique,

714
00:31:14,086 --> 00:31:15,906
helping to clarify the communication.

715
00:31:16,567 --> 00:31:18,447
They help to see, and they're able to see

716
00:31:18,467 --> 00:31:19,848
the conversation from the outside.

717
00:31:19,868 --> 00:31:21,028
They have an objective point of view

718
00:31:21,308 --> 00:31:22,468
and they can really then focus on

719
00:31:22,728 --> 00:31:24,829
how the communication is happening, right?

720
00:31:26,373 --> 00:31:28,856
That's great, but why is that relevant to this talk?

721
00:31:28,916 --> 00:31:31,820
Because we can't bring moderators in to our company

722
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:33,222
just to help everyone talk.

723
00:31:33,262 --> 00:31:35,405
Certainly when it's one-on-one talk, one-on-one we can't.

724
00:31:35,885 --> 00:31:38,669
And the answer to that is that anyone, anytime,

725
00:31:39,110 --> 00:31:39,951
can be a moderator.

726
00:31:40,872 --> 00:31:41,253
That's right.

727
00:31:42,487 --> 00:31:43,868
you can be the moderator.

728
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:45,528
Even if you're in the conversation,

729
00:31:46,269 --> 00:31:48,530
you can be inside of it and outside of it at the same time,

730
00:31:48,890 --> 00:31:50,710
acting as a moderator in the whole conversation

731
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:53,612
to kind of help facilitate that conversation as it's going on.

732
00:31:53,632 --> 00:31:55,852
Let's talk about some ways that we can be moderators

733
00:31:55,892 --> 00:31:56,893
of our own conversations.

734
00:31:57,473 --> 00:31:59,734
One is by helping to define your own unique perspective.

735
00:32:01,376 --> 00:32:07,500
These are some images of Wes, the drummer from Rock Band VR that was made by Sean Witt,

736
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,141
this wonderful artist we have at Harmonix.

737
00:32:10,402 --> 00:32:12,563
And I just love that drawing.

738
00:32:14,482 --> 00:32:16,243
I'll look at it more after the talk.

739
00:32:16,723 --> 00:32:19,925
But one of the things that Sean,

740
00:32:20,366 --> 00:32:22,027
he was working on this character,

741
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:22,988
he always works on characters,

742
00:32:23,348 --> 00:32:25,229
was able to bring to critiques,

743
00:32:25,429 --> 00:32:26,950
when people would have critiques about the characters,

744
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:28,291
how they've been through the rest of the game,

745
00:32:28,391 --> 00:32:29,252
is Sean's able to say, look,

746
00:32:29,492 --> 00:32:31,093
as my perspective as the figure artist,

747
00:32:31,454 --> 00:32:33,755
I really understand the narrative background

748
00:32:33,795 --> 00:32:34,656
of this character.

749
00:32:34,736 --> 00:32:36,517
I really understand his psychological makeup,

750
00:32:36,537 --> 00:32:37,638
I understand his personality,

751
00:32:38,058 --> 00:32:40,440
and therefore I understand that he should have

752
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,841
a certain kind of voice when we give him

753
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:43,362
the voice actor for him.

754
00:32:43,642 --> 00:32:46,525
or I should understand certain other things because of my point of view.

755
00:32:46,565 --> 00:32:49,608
He has that unique point of view that he can bring to this situation.

756
00:32:49,988 --> 00:32:51,129
And we can all focus on that.

757
00:32:51,189 --> 00:32:52,610
What is your unique perspective?

758
00:32:52,790 --> 00:32:53,871
And you can identify it.

759
00:32:53,932 --> 00:32:56,734
Don't just start talking before you say, here's the perspective I'm coming from.

760
00:32:57,254 --> 00:32:59,577
And sometimes you might be coming from perspectives that aren't your normal one.

761
00:32:59,597 --> 00:33:04,081
You might say, you know, as a player, when I'm playing through this game, I find x, y,

762
00:33:04,261 --> 00:33:05,021
and z to be the case.

763
00:33:05,041 --> 00:33:08,104
You can define that perspective that makes your feedback unique.

764
00:33:09,665 --> 00:33:10,926
And why is this helpful?

765
00:33:10,946 --> 00:33:12,246
Actually, another thing we can do

766
00:33:12,846 --> 00:33:15,147
is we can also invite others to do the same thing.

767
00:33:15,267 --> 00:33:17,047
So in the course of a critique, say, hey,

768
00:33:17,607 --> 00:33:20,688
Brian, as the designer, how do you see this issue?

769
00:33:21,148 --> 00:33:25,909
Or Sully, as the engineer, how do you see this issue?

770
00:33:25,929 --> 00:33:28,530
So we can invite people from their unique perspective

771
00:33:28,770 --> 00:33:30,390
to offer their input and advice.

772
00:33:30,770 --> 00:33:32,991
It establishes value of all points of view,

773
00:33:33,011 --> 00:33:35,011
and it really helps to be moderating

774
00:33:35,271 --> 00:33:36,972
these conversations in the very act

775
00:33:37,012 --> 00:33:38,592
of having the conversation itself.

776
00:33:40,057 --> 00:33:44,619
Another way we can act as moderators in the middle of a conversation is through reflection.

777
00:33:47,421 --> 00:33:51,102
Reflection is when we kind of rephrase and reflect back something that someone has said.

778
00:33:51,883 --> 00:33:57,366
This is a wonderful painting that Gianna Ruggiero did when we were in the pre-production process

779
00:33:57,446 --> 00:34:01,068
for Harmonix Music VR, and it was for where the dance scenes could take place that are

780
00:34:01,108 --> 00:34:01,988
part of that experience.

781
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:07,671
And some of the feedback was, you know, it just doesn't look like a very musical place.

782
00:34:08,432 --> 00:34:11,475
Now, in Jian's point of mind, it was a very musical place.

783
00:34:11,495 --> 00:34:13,396
You could have musical bushes, you could have musical trees.

784
00:34:13,657 --> 00:34:14,677
It was very musical.

785
00:34:15,118 --> 00:34:17,160
And so this is where reflection gets to be very helpful.

786
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:21,384
Because Jian could say, well, what I hear you saying is that we...

787
00:34:23,585 --> 00:34:27,766
this place is a place that doesn't have elements that can be musical at all.

788
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:33,527
And that gives then the person she was talking to, the designer, a chance to say, oh no,

789
00:34:33,567 --> 00:34:34,468
no, that's not what I meant.

790
00:34:34,948 --> 00:34:36,068
They could, you could have musical bushes.

791
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:40,909
What I mean is that we need to find a different place itself, which then gave Gianna the chance

792
00:34:40,929 --> 00:34:41,769
to be reflective again.

793
00:34:41,949 --> 00:34:46,630
Oh, what I hear you saying is we need to find a place that something about that place itself

794
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,851
is musical, a place we associate with music.

795
00:34:49,351 --> 00:34:50,931
Ah, yes, yes, that's right.

796
00:34:51,111 --> 00:34:52,852
So you can see that idea of reflecting back.

797
00:34:53,772 --> 00:34:58,696
rephrasing and reflecting, in this case we ended up placing it in a gymnasium like a

798
00:34:58,736 --> 00:35:03,119
high school dance, with a place itself that was a place where we go to enjoy music and dance.

799
00:35:04,302 --> 00:35:07,163
So some things to remember about moderating through reflection.

800
00:35:07,223 --> 00:35:08,323
First, rephrase.

801
00:35:08,363 --> 00:35:09,123
Don't just repeat.

802
00:35:10,184 --> 00:35:13,204
Second, it's an amazing, excellent way of translating,

803
00:35:13,544 --> 00:35:15,165
especially when we're working across disciplines.

804
00:35:15,645 --> 00:35:17,165
People who are coming at this from an engineering point

805
00:35:17,185 --> 00:35:18,566
of view or from a design point of view,

806
00:35:19,246 --> 00:35:21,466
they may be using words that mean something different

807
00:35:21,486 --> 00:35:23,187
to them than they mean for us.

808
00:35:23,507 --> 00:35:27,007
Because disciplines often speak about the same thing

809
00:35:27,428 --> 00:35:28,288
in different ways.

810
00:35:28,648 --> 00:35:30,528
And so reflecting is a great way to make sure

811
00:35:30,548 --> 00:35:33,629
that we're all on the same page and understanding together.

812
00:35:34,270 --> 00:35:37,854
It's also a great way to show that you're listening, right?

813
00:35:38,735 --> 00:35:41,338
So suddenly it helps to validate the people you're talking with.

814
00:35:41,378 --> 00:35:42,079
They feel listened to.

815
00:35:42,099 --> 00:35:42,840
They feel heard.

816
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:44,742
It shows that you care.

817
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:47,061
And why is this important?

818
00:35:47,641 --> 00:35:49,783
Because it helps others hear you, right?

819
00:35:50,124 --> 00:35:54,148
Especially if your feedback is going to be harsh, right?

820
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,250
If they're saying something and you're able to reflect back to them, you've understood

821
00:35:57,270 --> 00:36:00,493
what they're saying, you really are on the same page with them, I understand what you're

822
00:36:00,534 --> 00:36:04,397
saying but we just can't do that in this case because of X, Y, and Z.

823
00:36:05,058 --> 00:36:09,042
And then if you want to be super awesome, you can say, but that was a wonderful idea.

824
00:36:09,882 --> 00:36:10,422
And you know what?

825
00:36:10,543 --> 00:36:12,463
Why don't you help us figure out the next solution?

826
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:13,964
Let's all work on this together, right?

827
00:36:14,344 --> 00:36:20,087
Validate, incorporate, get people involved, make people feel invested, and it's just,

828
00:36:20,887 --> 00:36:22,488
those are all super helpful things to do.

829
00:36:22,508 --> 00:36:27,010
Another thing we can do to moderate when we're in the course of a conversation, if we can

830
00:36:27,050 --> 00:36:29,131
moderate by asking questions when we're giving feedback.

831
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:39,235
An example of that was we had these new cloth physics that had been designed for the characters

832
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:45,218
I was working on giving hair physics to for Rock Band 4, and it was a new system.

833
00:36:45,838 --> 00:36:53,682
And the engineer who did it initially had made it so that these top joints there were

834
00:36:53,702 --> 00:36:54,402
not constrained.

835
00:36:54,662 --> 00:36:57,265
it was different than our old system and so it wasn't working the way that I was

836
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:59,067
used to working it wasn't working the way that

837
00:36:59,408 --> 00:37:02,391
that uh... the old system had wasn't working the way I designed all the assets

838
00:37:02,431 --> 00:37:02,992
to work with it

839
00:37:03,493 --> 00:37:07,958
and I could have gone to him and said hey this is wrong it's not working right

840
00:37:08,539 --> 00:37:12,323
but I decided I stopped myself and I said wait a minute I'm going to ask him some questions first

841
00:37:12,403 --> 00:37:13,504
before I give that feedback

842
00:37:13,805 --> 00:37:14,345
you know so I said

843
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:16,807
You know, why did you do that?

844
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:18,809
Why did you design it so that's the default?

845
00:37:18,869 --> 00:37:20,790
He told me, and it actually was an interesting way.

846
00:37:20,810 --> 00:37:23,753
Actually, for our next game, maybe we

847
00:37:23,773 --> 00:37:25,994
could design the assets to do what he had in mind.

848
00:37:26,094 --> 00:37:27,615
But unfortunately, I hadn't designed them that way.

849
00:37:27,635 --> 00:37:29,377
So I was able to say, oh, I see that.

850
00:37:29,397 --> 00:37:30,117
That's an interesting way.

851
00:37:30,177 --> 00:37:31,038
Maybe next time we could do that.

852
00:37:31,058 --> 00:37:33,340
Let's do some R&D after this to figure that out.

853
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,781
But right now, unfortunately, the assets

854
00:37:34,801 --> 00:37:36,862
are designed to have the top joint constraint.

855
00:37:37,082 --> 00:37:38,363
So could you please make that the default?

856
00:37:38,724 --> 00:37:39,885
And he said, oh yeah, sure, no problem.

857
00:37:40,025 --> 00:37:40,605
And he did it.

858
00:37:40,886 --> 00:37:43,288
So asking questions before giving feedback

859
00:37:43,348 --> 00:37:44,869
is really helpful, because we have

860
00:37:44,889 --> 00:37:49,253
to assume that our assumptions are false.

861
00:37:49,713 --> 00:37:52,315
And this was actually something that I also

862
00:37:52,335 --> 00:37:53,376
learned from one of the engineers

863
00:37:53,696 --> 00:37:54,857
during when I was meeting with the engineers.

864
00:37:55,258 --> 00:37:58,600
One of our engineers, Fitzi, said during our feedback,

865
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,102
he said, you know, when I'm talking to an artist,

866
00:38:01,863 --> 00:38:04,125
I just have come to understand that I'm going to be

867
00:38:04,185 --> 00:38:05,646
wrong at least three times.

868
00:38:06,560 --> 00:38:08,543
You know, the first thing I'm going to think is going to be wrong.

869
00:38:08,763 --> 00:38:11,967
He's just come to understand that his initial assumptions are going to be false, and that's fine.

870
00:38:12,007 --> 00:38:13,969
He understands, because we're working across cultures,

871
00:38:14,189 --> 00:38:17,373
that the way he's thinking about something isn't the same way the artist is thinking about it.

872
00:38:18,974 --> 00:38:21,215
It also saves energy and time by asking questions,

873
00:38:21,395 --> 00:38:22,835
because we could suddenly get to the heart of the issue

874
00:38:22,855 --> 00:38:24,715
right away, and it certainly saves energy,

875
00:38:24,935 --> 00:38:27,956
because you imagine if I'd gone to this engineer

876
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:30,016
and said, hey, this system's broken,

877
00:38:30,356 --> 00:38:32,937
now suddenly he's upset, I've got all this anger,

878
00:38:33,137 --> 00:38:35,377
we're all angry, there's a lot of energy being wasted,

879
00:38:35,417 --> 00:38:36,957
right, so this saves a lot of energy.

880
00:38:37,337 --> 00:38:39,138
It also helps people feel included and valued,

881
00:38:39,318 --> 00:38:40,778
like a lot of the other things we're talking about today,

882
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:42,978
that gets to the core of empathic communication.

883
00:38:44,258 --> 00:38:46,359
But you can also moderate by asking questions

884
00:38:46,519 --> 00:38:47,799
when you're receiving feedback.

885
00:38:49,276 --> 00:38:52,137
So, if you're receiving, and this is a great story for this,

886
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:55,780
this is one of my favorite stories of this talk.

887
00:38:57,060 --> 00:38:58,221
Mitch Fletcher is one of the artists

888
00:38:58,341 --> 00:38:59,622
that I've worked with for a long time.

889
00:39:00,122 --> 00:39:01,743
Amazing, wonderful guy.

890
00:39:03,724 --> 00:39:04,945
He was working on Seeing Space with us,

891
00:39:04,985 --> 00:39:05,966
he's the environment artist.

892
00:39:06,606 --> 00:39:10,549
He'd gotten some feedback in a bug from someone in QA,

893
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:13,390
and that feedback was the art looks unfinished.

894
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,251
And Mitch said, you know,

895
00:39:17,684 --> 00:39:21,051
In years past, I would have been angry and I would have said,

896
00:39:21,813 --> 00:39:24,057
what the frick does he know what he's talking about?

897
00:39:24,378 --> 00:39:24,879
I'm the artist.

898
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,703
But he said, you know what I've come to realize?

899
00:39:27,864 --> 00:39:28,545
there's something there.

900
00:39:29,405 --> 00:39:30,146
If he thinks the artist,

901
00:39:30,426 --> 00:39:31,967
if that person thinks the artist is unfinished,

902
00:39:32,467 --> 00:39:33,908
other people are gonna think the artist is unfinished.

903
00:39:34,468 --> 00:39:36,450
And this game is not for artists,

904
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:38,111
this game is for everyone,

905
00:39:38,571 --> 00:39:39,672
and that's a good piece of feedback.

906
00:39:39,692 --> 00:39:41,833
Now, so I need to start asking him some questions

907
00:39:41,873 --> 00:39:42,454
to clarify it.

908
00:39:42,774 --> 00:39:43,174
So I can say, wait,

909
00:39:43,194 --> 00:39:45,296
you know, I can send back a comment on the bug.

910
00:39:45,496 --> 00:39:46,937
What is it about it that feels unfinished?

911
00:39:47,157 --> 00:39:49,118
And to kind of try to get more information, right?

912
00:39:49,358 --> 00:39:50,299
That that bit of feedback,

913
00:39:50,399 --> 00:39:51,920
even though it wasn't phrased well,

914
00:39:52,741 --> 00:39:56,843
was important because it was like a piece of coal

915
00:39:56,883 --> 00:39:58,563
that hadn't been crushed into the diamond, right?

916
00:39:58,583 --> 00:39:59,444
There's a diamond in there,

917
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,545
some really good feedback that could be really helpful,

918
00:40:01,745 --> 00:40:04,426
but he needed to ask questions to pull that feedback out.

919
00:40:04,867 --> 00:40:06,428
And he did, and then he ended up really doing

920
00:40:06,448 --> 00:40:09,429
this wonderful redo of this musically reactive art

921
00:40:09,489 --> 00:40:13,071
that's up in the sky as we're singing in Sing Space.

922
00:40:15,417 --> 00:40:19,242
And so a couple notes about this process of asking questions when you're receiving feedback

923
00:40:19,302 --> 00:40:20,203
as a way of moderating.

924
00:40:20,704 --> 00:40:23,868
One, just remember that non-artists often find it difficult to talk about art.

925
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,754
And that's the case, you know, this talk is in the art track by hoping everything is kind

926
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,518
of relevant for a lot of people who aren't just artists.

927
00:40:31,798 --> 00:40:32,900
So you can apply that to whatever.

928
00:40:34,021 --> 00:40:34,662
discipline you're in.

929
00:40:34,822 --> 00:40:40,550
Non-whatever you are often find it difficult to talk about whatever you do.

930
00:40:41,091 --> 00:40:43,655
But that doesn't mean that they don't have good ideas and opinions about it.

931
00:40:43,995 --> 00:40:47,881
And so sometimes you need to ask questions to get to the core of what they're trying

932
00:40:47,921 --> 00:40:48,341
to express.

933
00:40:50,204 --> 00:40:52,947
So we talked about a number of things

934
00:40:53,448 --> 00:40:55,570
that are helpful during the conversation,

935
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:56,512
just a quick review of them.

936
00:40:56,792 --> 00:40:59,796
And be participants and moderators at the same time.

937
00:41:01,738 --> 00:41:03,501
Some ways to do that are defining

938
00:41:03,581 --> 00:41:05,123
your unique perspective and helping other people

939
00:41:05,163 --> 00:41:08,728
to define theirs, rephrasing and reflecting ideas back.

940
00:41:09,700 --> 00:41:11,082
and making sure to ask questions.

941
00:41:11,682 --> 00:41:13,063
Certainly this isn't an exhaustive list,

942
00:41:13,123 --> 00:41:15,445
there's a lot more, but I think those start to get

943
00:41:15,706 --> 00:41:17,547
at the idea of what things you can do

944
00:41:17,847 --> 00:41:19,809
to act as both a moderator and a participant

945
00:41:20,069 --> 00:41:22,151
at the same time during a conversation.

946
00:41:24,994 --> 00:41:27,255
Before I close, this is one thing that came up

947
00:41:27,376 --> 00:41:28,977
as a question a lot when I was presenting this,

948
00:41:28,997 --> 00:41:30,518
is you know, sometimes we just disagree.

949
00:41:32,310 --> 00:41:37,417
Sometimes, you know, I want an apple and you want an orange and we're just never going

950
00:41:37,437 --> 00:41:38,058
to agree on that.

951
00:41:38,418 --> 00:41:38,578
Right?

952
00:41:38,718 --> 00:41:39,920
So the question was, well, what do we do then?

953
00:41:40,180 --> 00:41:43,304
How do these strategies help us to solve that problem?

954
00:41:43,664 --> 00:41:43,845
Right?

955
00:41:44,325 --> 00:41:44,425
Well...

956
00:41:45,431 --> 00:41:49,373
One thing that can be helpful is you can find a way within your company to have a structure

957
00:41:49,433 --> 00:41:53,635
in place that will help you to deal with that situation when it happens.

958
00:41:54,056 --> 00:41:59,218
And earlier in the week, and I can't stress this strongly enough, earlier in the week

959
00:41:59,238 --> 00:42:03,500
there was an amazing talk, I think it was on Monday, it was called Managing Conflict

960
00:42:03,540 --> 00:42:04,361
on Small Teams.

961
00:42:05,081 --> 00:42:09,724
It was by Rebecca Saltzman from Finji, and she went over some of the strategies that

962
00:42:09,744 --> 00:42:13,906
they'd use at Finji for dealing with this specific issue when there's conflict.

963
00:42:14,186 --> 00:42:15,906
I would strongly suggest you take a look at that.

964
00:42:16,406 --> 00:42:17,767
You might find some great ideas for that.

965
00:42:17,987 --> 00:42:21,188
But you can also work, the overall thing that's

966
00:42:21,208 --> 00:42:23,848
important is having a structure in place,

967
00:42:24,688 --> 00:42:26,249
either on your small team or on the larger teams,

968
00:42:26,409 --> 00:42:28,889
so when there are complete disagreements,

969
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:31,250
that people will be able to know what to do.

970
00:42:31,310 --> 00:42:33,390
It won't be on them to figure out what to do at that point.

971
00:42:33,791 --> 00:42:35,711
They will have a structure and something

972
00:42:35,731 --> 00:42:37,131
that they can do in that moment.

973
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:39,532
But even just using all the stuff

974
00:42:39,552 --> 00:42:40,612
I've talked with you about today,

975
00:42:41,572 --> 00:42:43,133
focusing on empathic communication.

976
00:42:45,425 --> 00:42:49,649
When we get to those points where we just disagree, we can often find that the strategies

977
00:42:49,669 --> 00:42:53,593
I've talked about today, we can find ways to disagree with respect and understanding.

978
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,757
If I've started to understand your point of view, even though I still disagree with it,

979
00:42:57,538 --> 00:42:59,740
I at least understand it and I can still respect you.

980
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:03,584
We're not going to get into a big fight over it if we use a lot of those strategies and

981
00:43:03,604 --> 00:43:04,725
techniques I've talked about today.

982
00:43:05,165 --> 00:43:05,766
And in fact...

983
00:43:06,327 --> 00:43:08,468
And this next point that I'm about to swipe to

984
00:43:08,888 --> 00:43:10,909
comes out of lots of talks with my wife.

985
00:43:10,989 --> 00:43:14,170
My wife, Jane Hesser, is an amazing artist

986
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:17,531
and she is also an amazing therapist.

987
00:43:18,052 --> 00:43:19,632
And one of the things that she has taught me

988
00:43:20,153 --> 00:43:24,014
is that, you know, the metaphor, the analogy is this.

989
00:43:24,955 --> 00:43:25,915
When you break a bone,

990
00:43:26,815 --> 00:43:29,076
it's stronger in the place where it heals.

991
00:43:30,037 --> 00:43:33,658
And that's true also of emotional relationships.

992
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:39,421
When our emotional relationships break, they are stronger after being healed.

993
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,181
We can all probably imagine that.

994
00:43:41,421 --> 00:43:43,742
Having an argument with someone, getting through it, finding it,

995
00:43:44,542 --> 00:43:47,722
we're stronger in our relationship having gotten through that.

996
00:43:48,262 --> 00:43:50,383
And so when we have these moments when we disagree,

997
00:43:50,603 --> 00:43:52,803
and we use strategies like I've talked about in this talk,

998
00:43:52,843 --> 00:43:53,884
or others that you can think of,

999
00:43:54,804 --> 00:43:56,624
to find ways to get through those disagreements,

1000
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,805
then we can not only just be...

1001
00:43:59,345 --> 00:44:02,090
but not get along, we can actually use this as a way to bond.

1002
00:44:02,351 --> 00:44:05,397
Our relationships can actually really improve through this process.

1003
00:44:06,912 --> 00:44:09,254
So in closing, here's just a quick slide

1004
00:44:09,574 --> 00:44:11,976
that summarizes some of the things I talked about today.

1005
00:44:12,497 --> 00:44:14,878
I've already reviewed a number of these at each point,

1006
00:44:14,898 --> 00:44:16,820
so I won't read through them all again.

1007
00:44:17,420 --> 00:44:20,983
But the most important thing with all of these

1008
00:44:21,664 --> 00:44:23,845
is to remember that you need to behave

1009
00:44:23,865 --> 00:44:25,607
with other people's experience in mind

1010
00:44:26,027 --> 00:44:28,329
in order to give feedback effectively,

1011
00:44:28,369 --> 00:44:29,430
and especially when we're communicating

1012
00:44:29,470 --> 00:44:30,150
across disciplines.

1013
00:44:30,791 --> 00:44:32,792
And you need to do that, you need to focus

1014
00:44:32,972 --> 00:44:34,834
on empathic communication.

1015
00:44:35,494 --> 00:44:41,301
And empathic communication is entirely based on the ability to have empathy, and empathy

1016
00:44:41,721 --> 00:44:46,447
is that ability to try to imagine something from someone else's point of view, recognize

1017
00:44:46,667 --> 00:44:49,751
that you're unable to do that, that there are holes in your image, and that you need

1018
00:44:49,771 --> 00:44:53,495
to become inquisitive and try to ask questions and fill in those gaps.

1019
00:44:57,757 --> 00:44:58,677
Thank you very much.

1020
00:44:59,137 --> 00:45:01,378
I hope you all enjoy thinking about this stuff

1021
00:45:01,398 --> 00:45:02,158
as much as I do.

1022
00:45:03,219 --> 00:45:05,239
These are, I think, super important things

1023
00:45:05,279 --> 00:45:06,960
for us to think about as an industry,

1024
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,581
and I would love to keep this conversation going.

1025
00:45:11,062 --> 00:45:14,243
Please take down my email, talk to me afterwards,

1026
00:45:15,343 --> 00:45:17,044
and I would love to find ways

1027
00:45:17,104 --> 00:45:19,024
to keep this dialogue moving forward

1028
00:45:19,425 --> 00:45:20,725
and to keep talking about these issues

1029
00:45:20,765 --> 00:45:22,186
and finding even more ways

1030
00:45:22,206 --> 00:45:24,567
that we can be incorporating this as an industry.

1031
00:45:25,247 --> 00:45:26,127
Thank you all very, very much.

1032
00:45:35,226 --> 00:45:37,050
Right, so I designed this to be plenty of time for questions.

1033
00:45:38,012 --> 00:45:39,315
And so we've got a good chunk of time.

1034
00:45:39,395 --> 00:45:42,061
If anyone has questions, you can please just use the microphones

1035
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:43,403
that are in the room.

1036
00:45:46,579 --> 00:45:47,480
Hi, great talk.

1037
00:45:48,460 --> 00:45:51,042
When you get together with different people,

1038
00:45:51,062 --> 00:45:53,344
do you ask them to prepare in any way?

1039
00:45:53,844 --> 00:45:55,906
And I'm asking this because when we have reviews,

1040
00:45:56,166 --> 00:45:58,047
I often notice that a lot of people come to the meeting

1041
00:45:58,087 --> 00:45:58,668
and are all busy.

1042
00:45:58,688 --> 00:46:01,630
They didn't get a chance to review any material beforehand.

1043
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:03,531
How do you deal with different people

1044
00:46:03,571 --> 00:46:05,233
and the different levels of preparedness?

1045
00:46:05,930 --> 00:46:12,396
Okay, so you're asking, when people come to a meeting, how do I make sure that everyone's

1046
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:13,177
on the same level?

1047
00:46:13,197 --> 00:46:15,859
Some people might be more prepared than other people are prepared?

1048
00:46:15,879 --> 00:46:20,243
Yeah, how do you avoid doing work in the meeting and having people prepared beforehand?

1049
00:46:20,323 --> 00:46:22,005
Oh, having people prepared before the meeting.

1050
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:24,547
That's a really good question.

1051
00:46:24,607 --> 00:46:26,989
I think often in the case with...

1052
00:46:27,730 --> 00:46:32,495
with art, and so this may be different for different disciplines, but often in the case

1053
00:46:32,535 --> 00:46:36,298
of art, if we're dealing with a critical feedback, we want to have a critique about something,

1054
00:46:36,999 --> 00:46:41,604
that's often not so vital because we're kind of, we come to it, we're not going to, we're

1055
00:46:41,624 --> 00:46:46,148
going to, part of the critique itself is to have time to experience it and that gets us

1056
00:46:46,188 --> 00:46:47,269
all on the same page with it.

1057
00:46:48,871 --> 00:46:54,256
But there are times if that art has very, very specific design constraints, then some

1058
00:46:54,296 --> 00:46:56,358
people don't understand that, then they're going to be less.

1059
00:46:56,678 --> 00:47:00,882
So I think the thing I try to do in those cases is before the meeting, it kind of goes

1060
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:05,606
into the preparation process, figure out what are the essential elements that everyone needs

1061
00:47:05,686 --> 00:47:06,047
to know.

1062
00:47:06,247 --> 00:47:09,670
If there are design constraints that people need to know, if there's art direction constraints

1063
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,432
that people need to know, let's just make sure we have that.

1064
00:47:13,565 --> 00:47:18,507
out right away so that people understand those issues and try to find a succinct way of telling

1065
00:47:18,527 --> 00:47:19,448
what those issues are.

1066
00:47:20,728 --> 00:47:24,110
And that works, I found that to work really well in an art context.

1067
00:47:25,570 --> 00:47:29,652
In a non-art context, I can't speak to, which, are you an artist or are you?

1068
00:47:30,499 --> 00:47:33,582
and I do a lot of different things.

1069
00:47:33,622 --> 00:47:36,866
It's different expertise, so it's indeed different for different people.

1070
00:47:36,886 --> 00:47:40,189
I imagine it would be very different, and that's one of the reasons I would love to start

1071
00:47:40,489 --> 00:47:43,252
expanding this conversation out to non-artists, so we can start talking about

1072
00:47:43,472 --> 00:47:47,196
some of the strategies that are helpful in other disciplines for doing these kinds of things.

1073
00:47:47,316 --> 00:47:49,518
Because I would imagine that in an engineering meeting...

1074
00:47:51,309 --> 00:47:54,350
that is the level of preparedness people need to have

1075
00:47:54,390 --> 00:47:55,751
is much greater coming into the meeting.

1076
00:47:56,071 --> 00:47:56,951
But I can't speak to that

1077
00:47:57,011 --> 00:47:58,552
because I don't have that experience.

1078
00:47:58,592 --> 00:47:59,893
Yeah, no, but that was helpful.

1079
00:47:59,933 --> 00:48:00,513
Thank you. Okay, great.

1080
00:48:00,833 --> 00:48:02,354
And that also reminds me of one little thing

1081
00:48:02,394 --> 00:48:04,995
that I had all my bubbles of the different departments.

1082
00:48:05,315 --> 00:48:07,917
My bubble for engineering initially said coders.

1083
00:48:08,377 --> 00:48:10,138
And in the course of my meeting with them,

1084
00:48:10,558 --> 00:48:11,578
I said, oh, wait a minute, you guys.

1085
00:48:11,778 --> 00:48:13,299
I've been meaning to ask you for a long time.

1086
00:48:13,319 --> 00:48:15,240
Do you guys like being called coders?

1087
00:48:16,101 --> 00:48:18,243
And I found out that a lot of them don't.

1088
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:20,565
A lot of them think it's like calling you a pixel pusher.

1089
00:48:20,585 --> 00:48:21,245
I said, well, yeah.

1090
00:48:21,625 --> 00:48:23,347
And so I said, well, and so I found out,

1091
00:48:23,407 --> 00:48:24,428
what do you like to be called?

1092
00:48:24,488 --> 00:48:26,249
And so I changed it to programmers here.

1093
00:48:26,950 --> 00:48:27,571
And it wasn't the case.

1094
00:48:27,611 --> 00:48:28,671
Some of them thought coders were fine.

1095
00:48:29,272 --> 00:48:31,034
But some of them didn't like it.

1096
00:48:31,374 --> 00:48:33,416
Yeah.

1097
00:48:33,876 --> 00:48:34,036
Hi.

1098
00:48:34,476 --> 00:48:37,359
So as you know, especially working on a big team,

1099
00:48:38,220 --> 00:48:38,980
this is a journey,

1100
00:48:39,040 --> 00:48:40,962
and the journey is sometimes fraught with pitfalls.

1101
00:48:43,340 --> 00:48:48,063
And I think sometimes I've encountered situations where there is a loss of respect and then

1102
00:48:48,083 --> 00:48:49,644
therefore like a loss of trust.

1103
00:48:49,965 --> 00:48:53,247
And with that comes baggage, especially if you know the dev cycle is long.

1104
00:48:53,747 --> 00:48:57,650
And so I guess from your point of view, from your past experience, what has been the best

1105
00:48:57,710 --> 00:49:00,812
way to resolve, you know, these more like...

1106
00:49:02,084 --> 00:49:06,288
ingrained and deep-seated issues have taken a while to kind of like form that ball.

1107
00:49:06,488 --> 00:49:07,609
Oh, yeah, that's a great question.

1108
00:49:07,649 --> 00:49:13,994
So the question is what what can we do and over a course of the time people haven't been paying attention to a lot of these

1109
00:49:14,014 --> 00:49:18,838
issues and therefore things have festered and now people have lost respect for each other. How can you repair that once it's happened?

1110
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:21,200
That's a great question. I think I mean the

1111
00:49:22,758 --> 00:49:24,359
There's the easy answer and there's the hard answer.

1112
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:26,020
The easy answer is to kind of negate

1113
00:49:26,040 --> 00:49:27,981
the foundation of your question and say,

1114
00:49:28,001 --> 00:49:31,263
well, the best thing to do is to start making sure

1115
00:49:31,283 --> 00:49:32,404
you have a culture in your company

1116
00:49:32,444 --> 00:49:34,425
of doing these types of things early on

1117
00:49:34,705 --> 00:49:36,646
so things don't fester and get to that point, right?

1118
00:49:36,666 --> 00:49:38,527
So that's the easy answer, but that kind of doesn't help you

1119
00:49:38,567 --> 00:49:39,487
in your question at all, right?

1120
00:49:39,507 --> 00:49:40,488
Because you might be dealing with this

1121
00:49:40,828 --> 00:49:41,829
in a specific case right now.

1122
00:49:43,249 --> 00:49:45,450
And I think that the best way to do that is

1123
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:51,086
Gosh, I don't know. I'm just kind of talking off the top of my head now that if I were in that situation

1124
00:49:51,106 --> 00:49:53,007
I would try to

1125
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:59,030
Find a way to get as many people on the team to recognize what's happened as possible to be transparent about it

1126
00:49:59,150 --> 00:50:00,911
So look we have developed

1127
00:50:01,631 --> 00:50:06,473
a problem here. We're not communicating well. Try not to personalize it if it's just one

1128
00:50:06,513 --> 00:50:10,454
person or another. Don't personalize it. Don't say, hey, you've really gotten to be angry

1129
00:50:10,494 --> 00:50:14,136
here and we don't like your anger. That's not going to be helpful. So try to find ways.

1130
00:50:14,876 --> 00:50:18,997
We aren't communicating as well as we can. Acknowledge that the structure has been the

1131
00:50:19,037 --> 00:50:24,319
problem. Blame the structure. We've had a really horrible structure for the first half

1132
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:27,180
of this project. There are a lot of things we haven't done that we should have done.

1133
00:50:27,821 --> 00:50:29,522
And that was a mistake, right?

1134
00:50:30,123 --> 00:50:34,467
And what we need to start doing now is finding some ways that we can fix that.

1135
00:50:34,887 --> 00:50:36,769
Because we don't learn, aren't trusting.

1136
00:50:37,149 --> 00:50:37,709
List what's happening.

1137
00:50:37,730 --> 00:50:39,411
We find that we're not trusting each other anymore.

1138
00:50:39,431 --> 00:50:40,892
You know, list that out.

1139
00:50:40,932 --> 00:50:42,073
Acknowledge that it's happening.

1140
00:50:42,394 --> 00:50:43,615
Blame the structure for it.

1141
00:50:44,075 --> 00:50:45,877
And then say, bring everyone in.

1142
00:50:45,997 --> 00:50:48,719
And don't say, okay, and here's what we're going to do to solve it.

1143
00:50:49,100 --> 00:50:49,260
Right?

1144
00:50:49,480 --> 00:50:50,801
Say, okay, as a group.

1145
00:50:51,422 --> 00:50:53,303
We need to start figuring out how we're going to solve these problems.

1146
00:50:53,663 --> 00:50:55,624
Let's all start thinking of ideas for this.

1147
00:50:56,085 --> 00:50:59,287
And then maybe some of the ideas in this talk can be things that can get that conversation

1148
00:50:59,327 --> 00:51:03,330
going, but the conversation itself should be a participatory process.

1149
00:51:03,510 --> 00:51:04,530
So everyone's invested.

1150
00:51:04,811 --> 00:51:08,533
And once everyone's invested, there's going to be a lot greater chance, if it was their

1151
00:51:08,613 --> 00:51:13,036
idea, right, there's going to be a lot better chance that they will do it going forward.

1152
00:51:13,296 --> 00:51:13,837
Is that helpful?

1153
00:51:15,198 --> 00:51:16,038
Yeah, that was very helpful.

1154
00:51:16,058 --> 00:51:16,318
Thank you.

1155
00:51:16,338 --> 00:51:16,819
Great, thanks.

1156
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:17,419
Hi.

1157
00:51:17,863 --> 00:51:23,225
This is a kind of a similar thought process of, is there anything you guys do specifically

1158
00:51:23,325 --> 00:51:29,528
to educate team-wide how to implement these techniques and have an effective conversation

1159
00:51:29,548 --> 00:51:35,811
or anything you do team-wide to help establish that process and structure, whether it's like

1160
00:51:35,951 --> 00:51:39,693
just having a mini-workshop on-site or things like that.

1161
00:51:39,713 --> 00:51:42,675
Is there anything specifically you guys implement to educate the team?

1162
00:51:42,915 --> 00:51:43,735
That's a great question.

1163
00:51:44,215 --> 00:51:45,896
The question is, what can we do on site?

1164
00:51:46,296 --> 00:51:49,017
What are some things we can do to implement this?

1165
00:51:49,077 --> 00:51:50,798
And just kind of ways that we can

1166
00:51:50,818 --> 00:51:52,619
make sure everyone's on the same page with these ideas.

1167
00:51:54,039 --> 00:51:56,200
Well, last year, a couple things.

1168
00:51:56,320 --> 00:52:00,262
One, Harmonix has periodically brought in outside consultants

1169
00:52:00,342 --> 00:52:02,182
to run workshops with lots of people

1170
00:52:02,203 --> 00:52:04,684
around the company about facilitating communication.

1171
00:52:05,404 --> 00:52:07,485
And that's been super helpful.

1172
00:52:08,185 --> 00:52:10,306
Another thing, last year, after my.

1173
00:52:10,866 --> 00:52:16,751
my previous GDC talk, on maximizing critique, after that I gave the talk to the whole company

1174
00:52:17,171 --> 00:52:19,874
so that there's another way of making sure we're all on the same page with that.

1175
00:52:20,774 --> 00:52:25,218
And then in the process leading up to this, and this has been a little bit more individually

1176
00:52:25,238 --> 00:52:29,141
motivated on my part, but I've actually been going around and getting feedback and getting

1177
00:52:29,181 --> 00:52:32,404
input from all the departments, which has really been helpful in already starting some

1178
00:52:32,424 --> 00:52:33,605
of these conversations.

1179
00:52:34,025 --> 00:52:35,747
And I don't want to say that I was...

1180
00:52:36,427 --> 00:52:38,369
These conversations, a lot of them were already happening, right?

1181
00:52:38,629 --> 00:52:42,893
And it wasn't that I started these conversations at Harmonix at all, but as I started talking

1182
00:52:42,913 --> 00:52:46,996
to the different departments about it, it helped to bring those conversations out and

1183
00:52:47,016 --> 00:52:48,697
help other people start talking about it more.

1184
00:52:49,018 --> 00:52:49,959
So that's been really helpful.

1185
00:52:50,039 --> 00:52:56,244
And in fact, I think that talking to individual departments has in many ways been more valuable

1186
00:52:56,264 --> 00:53:00,067
than talking to the company as a whole, because we can have these nice little individual conversations.

1187
00:53:00,107 --> 00:53:01,188
So some combination of that.

1188
00:53:02,109 --> 00:53:02,509
Does that help?

1189
00:53:02,529 --> 00:53:03,390
Does that answer your question?

1190
00:53:03,410 --> 00:53:03,830
Yeah, thank you.

1191
00:53:03,850 --> 00:53:03,930
Yeah.

1192
00:53:03,950 --> 00:53:04,190
Yeah.

1193
00:53:06,737 --> 00:53:06,917
Hi.

1194
00:53:08,219 --> 00:53:08,479
Hi.

1195
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:12,503
You talked about like for certain things

1196
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,706
where people just disagree

1197
00:53:14,986 --> 00:53:19,071
and there's, it's not a matter of miscommunication.

1198
00:53:19,111 --> 00:53:20,472
Like they're just kind of butting heads

1199
00:53:20,612 --> 00:53:21,994
against fundamentally different things.

1200
00:53:22,875 --> 00:53:24,276
And you mentioned like processes

1201
00:53:24,396 --> 00:53:26,779
for dealing with that situation.

1202
00:53:26,799 --> 00:53:26,859
Yes.

1203
00:53:27,199 --> 00:53:28,441
What are some examples of that?

1204
00:53:29,354 --> 00:53:32,518
Well, one, which if you have access to the vault,

1205
00:53:32,558 --> 00:53:34,500
that talk I mentioned from last Monday,

1206
00:53:34,520 --> 00:53:36,563
and I'm not going to,

1207
00:53:36,763 --> 00:53:38,245
Rebecca Saltzman's talk was amazing,

1208
00:53:38,285 --> 00:53:40,608
and she gave some great, great ideas for that

1209
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:41,850
that they use really well.

1210
00:53:42,370 --> 00:53:42,470
And,

1211
00:53:47,931 --> 00:53:51,112
So I would really suggest you, that's a whole big other topic.

1212
00:53:51,412 --> 00:53:54,454
And I think if you, I can't recommend highly enough

1213
00:53:54,494 --> 00:53:55,314
that you watch that.

1214
00:53:55,574 --> 00:53:57,935
I was blown away by her talk on Monday.

1215
00:53:57,975 --> 00:53:58,515
Rebecca's?

1216
00:53:58,775 --> 00:53:59,796
Rebecca Saltzman.

1217
00:54:00,056 --> 00:54:00,316
OK, got it.

1218
00:54:00,336 --> 00:54:04,098
S-A-L-T-Z, S-A-L-T-S-M-A-N.

1219
00:54:04,318 --> 00:54:04,998
OK, thanks.

1220
00:54:06,619 --> 00:54:08,379
And yeah, it was on Monday.

1221
00:54:08,459 --> 00:54:09,800
And I can give you more reference to that

1222
00:54:10,040 --> 00:54:11,341
when you come back up there.

1223
00:54:12,821 --> 00:54:13,521
Any other questions?

1224
00:54:16,281 --> 00:54:17,562
Hi, thank you so much for your talk.

1225
00:54:18,683 --> 00:54:23,006
I actually am an assistant producer and I do a lot of feedback gathering for artists,

1226
00:54:23,446 --> 00:54:25,888
but I do it across multiple different offices.

1227
00:54:25,988 --> 00:54:30,952
So we'll do Chicago, France, Russia, and here in San Francisco.

1228
00:54:31,292 --> 00:54:35,975
The biggest issue I have is getting all these people from all these different offices on

1229
00:54:35,995 --> 00:54:37,236
the same page regarding...

1230
00:54:38,077 --> 00:54:42,779
what they want to go in the general direction for the artist without inundating the artist with

1231
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:51,423
million different ideas and concepting, you know, 16 different things. Do you have any great suggestions on trying to get all these different

1232
00:54:52,163 --> 00:54:54,945
people in all these different time zones on the same page?

1233
00:54:56,096 --> 00:55:15,356
That's a tricky one. So yes, we did harmonics. We've been doing a lot of people working remotely and we can all kind of talk. We use Skype a lot, which has been super helpful, but we're not working that remotely. We're kind of we're some of our people like three hours apart, kind of spread across across the United States, as we're still able to kind of be with each other at least once a day. It sounds like the struggle you're having is people are like globally like people.

1234
00:55:15,776 --> 00:55:20,880
Yeah, we usually do global conversations via Skype to try and capture all these things,

1235
00:55:20,940 --> 00:55:26,024
all the ideas and stuff like that, but it's always the hardest part is getting the very

1236
00:55:26,244 --> 00:55:29,027
first foundation and then building up from there.

1237
00:55:29,287 --> 00:55:34,551
And we try not to get the artists involved because we tried doing that initially, and

1238
00:55:34,591 --> 00:55:39,675
it just became 16, 17 different concepts that took weeks on end to do.

1239
00:55:40,135 --> 00:55:42,778
And we're trying to not have them do that.

1240
00:55:43,138 --> 00:55:45,805
So you're trying to define what the initial goals are

1241
00:55:45,825 --> 00:55:48,331
that then you can disseminate to everyone else?

1242
00:55:48,532 --> 00:55:48,712
Right.

1243
00:55:48,752 --> 00:55:50,817
And who is involved in that initial conversation

1244
00:55:50,838 --> 00:55:51,660
of defining what those?

1245
00:55:52,408 --> 00:55:57,749
Usually it's our marketing, production, high tier usually.

1246
00:55:57,769 --> 00:55:59,690
And what would some of those kinds of things be?

1247
00:55:59,710 --> 00:56:01,850
What would be the product that that team

1248
00:56:02,110 --> 00:56:03,250
would be figuring out?

1249
00:56:03,330 --> 00:56:05,311
Usually these are like key art.

1250
00:56:05,931 --> 00:56:08,492
So I work on World of Tanks for console

1251
00:56:08,572 --> 00:56:10,052
and we do like splash screens

1252
00:56:10,172 --> 00:56:11,312
for when you load into the game.

1253
00:56:11,352 --> 00:56:13,793
We do news article, things like that.

1254
00:56:13,833 --> 00:56:17,114
We'll try to use the art in multiple different ways.

1255
00:56:17,254 --> 00:56:18,174
Yeah.

1256
00:56:18,454 --> 00:56:18,954
Things like that.

1257
00:56:19,014 --> 00:56:19,955
That's a tricky one.

1258
00:56:19,975 --> 00:56:21,918
There's a certainly, so the issue is like,

1259
00:56:21,938 --> 00:56:24,241
a lot of the key art and things that need to be done

1260
00:56:24,261 --> 00:56:26,924
for marketing, how can that be integrated

1261
00:56:27,005 --> 00:56:28,426
as part of the team development?

1262
00:56:28,526 --> 00:56:28,807
Right.

1263
00:56:29,007 --> 00:56:30,369
Yeah, that's a tricky one.

1264
00:56:32,304 --> 00:56:34,005
Because it often needs to happen independently,

1265
00:56:34,085 --> 00:56:36,007
but the stuff you're doing is really

1266
00:56:36,047 --> 00:56:38,809
how this team who's been so invested in the work

1267
00:56:38,829 --> 00:56:40,370
that they've done, this is how the world

1268
00:56:40,410 --> 00:56:41,891
is going to see their work.

1269
00:56:42,191 --> 00:56:44,133
And unfortunately, often, the way

1270
00:56:44,173 --> 00:56:45,334
the world's going to initially see their work

1271
00:56:45,734 --> 00:56:47,635
isn't the way they want the world to see their work

1272
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:48,936
after being invested in it.

1273
00:56:49,036 --> 00:56:50,818
And a lot of tension can be created there.

1274
00:56:51,538 --> 00:56:57,382
And I just, if there's some way, and I see you're,

1275
00:56:58,861 --> 00:57:02,744
to find a way to make people feel engaged and part of that process

1276
00:57:03,804 --> 00:57:06,726
without then, what you said, like having all these different concepts involved.

1277
00:57:06,986 --> 00:57:09,848
I think that, you know, maybe it's a question of having something you've done

1278
00:57:09,888 --> 00:57:12,750
and then asking, opening up for feedback on it, and a very constrained,

1279
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:15,712
you know, like, not open feedback, but saying, here's what, here's what we have

1280
00:57:15,992 --> 00:57:18,514
and we need some feedback on you, here are the things we are concerned about.

1281
00:57:18,734 --> 00:57:23,477
So people, you know, but that is an issue that I think happens in a lot of companies

1282
00:57:23,597 --> 00:57:24,417
and it's just something that...

1283
00:57:25,405 --> 00:57:27,427
is something to really work on.

1284
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:28,488
Because I think people, you know,

1285
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:29,508
a lot of those artists and people

1286
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:32,250
who have spent so much of their time on the work

1287
00:57:32,510 --> 00:57:34,572
and then feel that the way it's being publicized

1288
00:57:34,952 --> 00:57:36,913
is out of sync with all the work they've done,

1289
00:57:37,494 --> 00:57:40,636
that can really create a lot of morale issues.

1290
00:57:41,176 --> 00:57:42,818
And so I think that finding ways,

1291
00:57:42,878 --> 00:57:45,239
either from the beginning or toward the end,

1292
00:57:45,619 --> 00:57:47,881
to incorporate the feedback of the artists.

1293
00:57:49,034 --> 00:57:52,096
And not in a way that asks them to do the work themselves,

1294
00:57:52,336 --> 00:57:54,719
but in a way that somehow asks for feedback

1295
00:57:54,739 --> 00:57:57,000
so they feel as though they're part of the process.

1296
00:57:57,020 --> 00:57:57,981
I think it's really important.

1297
00:57:58,382 --> 00:58:00,984
Like a preemptive meeting with the artists themselves

1298
00:58:01,104 --> 00:58:02,685
away from the others.

1299
00:58:03,885 --> 00:58:05,826
Perhaps, every company would need to do it different ways,

1300
00:58:05,886 --> 00:58:07,527
and different companies are different sizes.

1301
00:58:07,848 --> 00:58:09,349
And so I don't know the specific strategy

1302
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:10,389
to be great for your company.

1303
00:58:11,470 --> 00:58:15,233
But the goal, what I do understand is the goal,

1304
00:58:15,273 --> 00:58:15,913
I think, would be great.

1305
00:58:15,933 --> 00:58:18,215
And the goal would be to help everyone,

1306
00:58:18,255 --> 00:58:20,796
as many people as possible, feel invested and involved.

1307
00:58:21,657 --> 00:58:22,898
And that would be the goal.

1308
00:58:23,438 --> 00:58:25,820
So I'm not sure the specific strategy would be helpful.

1309
00:58:25,840 --> 00:58:26,861
But often having the goal.

1310
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:31,880
is the key, because the strategies often end up falling out from that goal.

1311
00:58:32,180 --> 00:58:34,681
So even that answer, the question I didn't answer so well a moment ago,

1312
00:58:34,701 --> 00:58:36,501
like, what do you do when people really just disagree?

1313
00:58:37,322 --> 00:58:39,322
Well, what's your goal for that?

1314
00:58:39,963 --> 00:58:43,684
Our goal is to come up with a strategy that works in our company

1315
00:58:44,144 --> 00:58:46,805
that we can all agree on, that when we disagree,

1316
00:58:47,065 --> 00:58:48,325
here are the steps we're going to follow.

1317
00:58:49,306 --> 00:58:51,866
And so that's the goal, and I think every company

1318
00:58:51,906 --> 00:58:53,827
can start to find its own way to implement that.

1319
00:58:55,113 --> 00:58:56,714
So I kind of answered both questions at once there.

1320
00:58:56,854 --> 00:58:57,695
Did I answer your question?

1321
00:58:57,715 --> 00:58:58,355
Did I give you a sense of that?

1322
00:58:58,375 --> 00:58:58,836
Yes, you did.

1323
00:58:58,896 --> 00:58:59,216
Thank you.

1324
00:58:59,236 --> 00:58:59,456
All right.

1325
00:58:59,476 --> 00:58:59,956
Thank you very much.

1326
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:00,737
All right.

1327
00:59:01,458 --> 00:59:03,019
Oh, yeah.

1328
00:59:03,099 --> 00:59:03,799
Thank you for the talk.

1329
00:59:04,560 --> 00:59:12,086
So in our team, professionally, when we're discussing our own work, we tend to try to

1330
00:59:12,126 --> 00:59:15,649
implement these processes, but we backslide a lot during social hour.

1331
00:59:15,749 --> 00:59:18,031
So specifically, like if we're playing games together.

1332
00:59:18,778 --> 00:59:22,541
People can just get really like brutal and want to double down on like oh

1333
00:59:22,981 --> 00:59:28,425
Why would they have made that art decision like that shitty and that looks like crap and having that

1334
00:59:29,306 --> 00:59:31,047
ends up creating backslide

1335
00:59:31,887 --> 00:59:38,933
During our own critiques. Yeah, you have strategies for discouraging that kind of behavior when it's not in a specific work situation

1336
00:59:38,953 --> 00:59:39,933
But it's affecting work

1337
00:59:40,268 --> 00:59:41,449
Yeah, that's a tricky one, right?

1338
00:59:41,469 --> 00:59:43,089
Because we can't, it's a great question.

1339
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:44,270
So the question as I understand it is,

1340
00:59:45,610 --> 00:59:47,971
it's one thing to make sure you can have a structures

1341
00:59:48,191 --> 00:59:50,512
and language at work that everyone kind of follows

1342
00:59:50,552 --> 00:59:51,372
to stay on the same page.

1343
00:59:51,653 --> 00:59:53,993
But often outside of work, people start to use

1344
00:59:54,013 --> 00:59:57,055
really derogatory or insulting or harsh language

1345
00:59:57,395 --> 01:00:00,276
about things that then starts to leach back

1346
01:00:00,336 --> 01:00:01,476
into the relationships at work.

1347
01:00:01,996 --> 01:00:02,436
Yeah.

1348
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:04,437
Yeah, I think.

1349
01:00:06,659 --> 01:00:08,160
that's again, it gets just to come back

1350
01:00:08,180 --> 01:00:09,140
to the larger cultural thing.

1351
01:00:09,160 --> 01:00:11,100
You can't tell people what to do outside of work, of course,

1352
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:14,341
but what you can as a company start to really encourage

1353
01:00:14,541 --> 01:00:17,842
is, hey, these are efficient ways to work,

1354
01:00:17,882 --> 01:00:19,722
but they're also great in our regular life.

1355
01:00:19,822 --> 01:00:21,903
I think if these ideas are presented in that way,

1356
01:00:21,923 --> 01:00:24,583
you know, like, hey, you might find that this stuff

1357
01:00:24,623 --> 01:00:25,664
is not just helpful for you at work,

1358
01:00:25,844 --> 01:00:27,284
but it's also helpful for you outside of work.

1359
01:00:27,624 --> 01:00:30,325
You just suggest that as a way to kind of encourage people

1360
01:00:30,345 --> 01:00:31,685
that this is not just a culture here,

1361
01:00:31,965 --> 01:00:34,085
but it's a culture to behave in life that's helpful.

1362
01:00:34,786 --> 01:00:35,766
And then also.

1363
01:00:36,826 --> 01:00:39,307
even outside of work, catching that,

1364
01:00:39,347 --> 01:00:40,648
if people are talking that way,

1365
01:00:41,448 --> 01:00:43,889
standing up and saying, hey, that's really not helpful

1366
01:00:43,909 --> 01:00:44,889
when we talk about it that way.

1367
01:00:44,909 --> 01:00:49,611
And I think if individuals can take that on themself

1368
01:00:49,971 --> 01:00:54,732
to realize that, you know, it's like a lot of other,

1369
01:00:54,913 --> 01:00:58,034
kind of touches on a lot of other issues going on now,

1370
01:00:58,074 --> 01:01:00,895
right, like when stuff's going on in society

1371
01:01:00,915 --> 01:01:04,176
and you see people behaving in some horrible, horrible ways.

1372
01:01:05,058 --> 01:01:08,766
Is it, you know, can you just ignore it or is it your responsibility to kind of say,

1373
01:01:08,806 --> 01:01:10,189
hey, that's not, that's not awesome.

1374
01:01:10,589 --> 01:01:11,511
And this is what you're saying.

1375
01:01:11,531 --> 01:01:15,860
It's not nearly as bad as what's going on outside this room, but if you.

1376
01:01:17,227 --> 01:01:20,968
find ways to take it even outside of work if you see that happening

1377
01:01:21,329 --> 01:01:24,690
say hey that's that's not really helpful we talk about that way even even here

1378
01:01:25,030 --> 01:01:28,912
you know what or you can even your instead of judging it you can just turn

1379
01:01:28,972 --> 01:01:29,152
it say

1380
01:01:29,592 --> 01:01:32,714
what what was on the examples you said that they would say like that you're

1381
01:01:32,754 --> 01:01:32,974
like

1382
01:01:33,374 --> 01:01:36,896
like we're playing games together at lunch that somebody might start like

1383
01:01:37,316 --> 01:01:38,797
bragging on the art style

1384
01:01:38,897 --> 01:01:45,019
Yeah, like, well, the art style book really sucks.

1385
01:01:45,059 --> 01:01:48,521
Then you say, well, what is it about it that you don't like?

1386
01:01:48,881 --> 01:01:50,822
Just instead of telling them they've done something wrong,

1387
01:01:51,082 --> 01:01:52,783
you can encourage them to rephrase it.

1388
01:01:53,063 --> 01:01:54,904
Oh, what is it about it that you don't like?

1389
01:01:54,944 --> 01:01:56,324
And if they continue to use, just

1390
01:01:56,364 --> 01:01:58,785
start kind of pulling from them until you've pulled out

1391
01:01:58,825 --> 01:02:01,046
from them helpful language about it.

1392
01:02:01,326 --> 01:02:04,148
Even if it's not impacting you, what you're doing then

1393
01:02:04,188 --> 01:02:06,309
is you're starting to give them a moment

1394
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:08,510
to learn how to rephrase things that are helpful.

1395
01:02:09,503 --> 01:02:10,924
And if you just kind of start doing that all the time,

1396
01:02:10,984 --> 01:02:12,205
other people might start doing it too,

1397
01:02:12,525 --> 01:02:13,785
and then people start to really learn

1398
01:02:14,405 --> 01:02:15,086
better ways of speaking.

1399
01:02:15,126 --> 01:02:17,027
That's one strategy, but it's a tricky situation.

1400
01:02:17,147 --> 01:02:17,707
Is that helpful?

1401
01:02:17,747 --> 01:02:18,547
Yeah, yeah, thank you.

1402
01:02:18,567 --> 01:02:18,807
Awesome.

1403
01:02:18,827 --> 01:02:20,008
Well, that's our last question.

1404
01:02:20,048 --> 01:02:21,829
I'm gonna be up here as long as I can,

1405
01:02:22,109 --> 01:02:24,290
and then I'll also be in the hall,

1406
01:02:24,310 --> 01:02:25,670
but depending on how many people it is,

1407
01:02:25,850 --> 01:02:26,650
if anybody wants to stay,

1408
01:02:26,670 --> 01:02:28,851
I will stay as long as anybody wants to talk about anything,

1409
01:02:29,332 --> 01:02:31,592
so we may end up in the wrap-up room around the corner.

1410
01:02:31,673 --> 01:02:33,133
Thank you all so much for coming,

1411
01:02:33,153 --> 01:02:33,773
and thanks for staying.
