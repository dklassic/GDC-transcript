1
00:00:05,942 --> 00:00:08,704
So, hello, my name is Frederic Renal.

2
00:00:09,384 --> 00:00:14,088
I'm the creator and programmer of the first Alone in the Dark.

3
00:00:15,469 --> 00:00:15,849
And I'm here...

4
00:00:15,869 --> 00:00:16,230
Thank you.

5
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:17,491
Thank you.

6
00:00:17,551 --> 00:00:17,811
Thank you.

7
00:00:22,454 --> 00:00:27,276
And I'm here to tell you the story of the making of this game.

8
00:00:27,896 --> 00:00:35,179
And I'm very, very happy to be here, especially this year, 2012, because it's the 20th anniversary

9
00:00:35,239 --> 00:00:35,759
of this game.

10
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:40,601
Exactly 20 years ago, I was working 15 hours a day to try to make...

11
00:00:41,641 --> 00:00:47,786
this exists. So before going deep inside the conception of the game, I just want to tell

12
00:00:47,806 --> 00:00:53,671
you a few things about me before this game, because it's important, because it helps to

13
00:00:53,731 --> 00:00:56,654
understand from where came the inspiration.

14
00:00:59,289 --> 00:01:03,732
Early 80s, my father got a computer shop,

15
00:01:03,752 --> 00:01:05,234
it was named Videomatique.

16
00:01:06,034 --> 00:01:07,716
It was in France, I'm French.

17
00:01:08,657 --> 00:01:11,959
And I was helping customers with computers,

18
00:01:12,039 --> 00:01:13,741
repairing their computers.

19
00:01:14,925 --> 00:01:21,266
And here I made a game in 88, which was Popcorn.

20
00:01:21,326 --> 00:01:22,766
It was a breakout freeware.

21
00:01:23,106 --> 00:01:28,587
Nothing very important, but Infogrames saw this game and

22
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:32,528
called me to work at Infogrames.

23
00:01:32,928 --> 00:01:36,309
But something which is the most important thing is that

24
00:01:36,769 --> 00:01:41,870
my father's shop was also a VHS movie tape rental shop.

25
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,931
So I was working days and nights in this shop.

26
00:01:46,111 --> 00:01:50,672
So at night, when I was bored programming, I watched movies.

27
00:01:51,252 --> 00:01:55,773
I maybe watched all the movies I can find in the shop.

28
00:01:55,813 --> 00:01:59,194
And I was very, very fond of all the horror movies.

29
00:01:59,254 --> 00:02:01,655
I was 20-plus years old at this time.

30
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:03,535
And my heroes were.

31
00:02:04,836 --> 00:02:09,542
George Romero, Dario Argento, I loved all those movies.

32
00:02:09,562 --> 00:02:11,224
I love zombies.

33
00:02:11,665 --> 00:02:16,672
And something which is very interesting is the structure of that kind of movies,

34
00:02:17,072 --> 00:02:21,258
all the 70s horror movies, is that usually you are...

35
00:02:21,939 --> 00:02:25,301
one guy or a group of guy entering a special environment

36
00:02:25,761 --> 00:02:27,162
and just tries to survive.

37
00:02:27,662 --> 00:02:30,324
Look at the headline of Amityville.

38
00:02:30,804 --> 00:02:32,946
The scenario of Alone in the Dark is written on it.

39
00:02:33,066 --> 00:02:34,947
For God's sake, just get out.

40
00:02:35,607 --> 00:02:38,329
And that was the main inspiration for that.

41
00:02:38,409 --> 00:02:42,092
But I didn't know that at this time.

42
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:47,855
I also, I was 20 years old, playing a lot of role playing

43
00:02:47,875 --> 00:02:50,137
game also with my friend at this time.

44
00:02:51,017 --> 00:02:54,879
And, uh, especially Dungeon and Dragon, I played a little bit,

45
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,560
uh, Call of Cthulhu, because actually I didn't like it.

46
00:02:57,660 --> 00:03:01,242
The character x, uh, character sheet was so huge,

47
00:03:01,262 --> 00:03:03,503
and it was so, uh, difficult.

48
00:03:04,063 --> 00:03:07,284
Okay, but I'll be back, uh, on, um, on that later.

49
00:03:07,685 --> 00:03:09,645
So, I joined Infogrames in, uh, 99.

50
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:17,404
I was doing some programming stuff, low-level function, graphical function and everything.

51
00:03:17,884 --> 00:03:23,907
And one day, I was involved in the conversion of a game, which is AlphaWaze.

52
00:03:23,967 --> 00:03:25,507
It was named Continuum here.

53
00:03:26,067 --> 00:03:26,708
We were in the 90s.

54
00:03:28,308 --> 00:03:30,450
The name of the game was The Cube at this time.

55
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:33,112
Christophe de Dinoshin is the creator of this game.

56
00:03:33,412 --> 00:03:38,256
And I did the conversion, the port, from the Atari ST to PC.

57
00:03:38,776 --> 00:03:40,117
It was all ASM code.

58
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:44,360
So I worked for six months on this game.

59
00:03:45,376 --> 00:03:50,281
And so I spent six months inside a rotating cube.

60
00:03:50,641 --> 00:03:51,562
Because it was a game.

61
00:03:51,602 --> 00:03:54,825
You can see it at the GDC play part.

62
00:03:54,865 --> 00:03:56,567
There is a demonstration of this game.

63
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:58,348
It's a bouncing shape.

64
00:03:58,849 --> 00:04:01,291
And it's the first 3D platform game.

65
00:04:02,112 --> 00:04:05,734
And so I spent six months with this rotating cube around me.

66
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:07,856
And it obsessed me.

67
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:11,679
I was always thinking, there is something to do with 3D.

68
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:17,864
And I didn't know yet quite exactly, but my imagination.

69
00:04:18,962 --> 00:04:23,664
was very, very motivated, said, OK, we can modelize something

70
00:04:23,944 --> 00:04:28,245
more and more better than just small shapes like this.

71
00:04:28,685 --> 00:04:31,946
And I was thinking about 3D characters.

72
00:04:32,266 --> 00:04:33,807
And I said, OK, there is something

73
00:04:33,887 --> 00:04:35,667
to do with 3D characters.

74
00:04:35,747 --> 00:04:39,128
And one day, it came quite quickly.

75
00:04:39,268 --> 00:04:41,829
Everything went very smoothly and logically.

76
00:04:42,309 --> 00:04:44,350
And one day, I said, I have this idea.

77
00:04:45,617 --> 00:04:47,418
It was my first vision of the game.

78
00:04:47,799 --> 00:04:51,983
I wanted to have articulated and skinned 3D characters

79
00:04:52,663 --> 00:04:55,266
with first 3D zombies.

80
00:04:55,606 --> 00:04:57,028
I was really, really excited.

81
00:04:57,068 --> 00:04:59,150
OK, now it's possible.

82
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:02,413
I can do a game with 3D zombies.

83
00:05:03,374 --> 00:05:06,857
My favorite game at this time were adventure and action

84
00:05:06,897 --> 00:05:07,118
games.

85
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:13,734
had to be an adventure game with some action.

86
00:05:14,275 --> 00:05:16,276
I'll go deeper in that later.

87
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:22,280
And about how to play, because we were in the early 90s,

88
00:05:23,641 --> 00:05:26,803
we couldn't manage many characters, dialogues,

89
00:05:26,843 --> 00:05:27,383
and everything.

90
00:05:27,403 --> 00:05:28,764
Say, OK, it's a game.

91
00:05:28,884 --> 00:05:30,105
You are just alone.

92
00:05:30,265 --> 00:05:32,246
Because it was just convenient.

93
00:05:32,426 --> 00:05:36,269
Say, no human interactions, no dialogue, things like that.

94
00:05:37,367 --> 00:05:43,473
And when can this game exist?

95
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:51,221
The year 1920 is very convenient because there is electricity, so you can have light,

96
00:05:51,981 --> 00:05:56,145
but there is no electronics, there is no complicated stuff.

97
00:05:56,366 --> 00:05:58,368
So it was perfect for...

98
00:05:59,373 --> 00:06:04,335
For the date, the place, the idea came from horror movies,

99
00:06:04,715 --> 00:06:09,578
and an old mansion, an old haunted manor for the place.

100
00:06:10,298 --> 00:06:13,940
And the scenario, just get out alive.

101
00:06:14,260 --> 00:06:16,181
You enter the situation, you enter the house,

102
00:06:16,721 --> 00:06:20,643
and you just have to exit the house alive.

103
00:06:21,844 --> 00:06:28,450
Something I knew since the beginning is that I needed to have some text to read because

104
00:06:30,152 --> 00:06:36,818
to make something very scary, and especially back in at this time, with just a few polygons,

105
00:06:36,978 --> 00:06:42,863
that's something that is not very frightening. So I knew that I needed the text to put a

106
00:06:42,983 --> 00:06:48,588
situation to have a very heavy background story for the game.

107
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,733
And so something I understood very quickly, too,

108
00:06:53,893 --> 00:06:59,417
is that with the polygons, the number of polygons,

109
00:06:59,457 --> 00:07:02,660
the amount of polygons I can put in the engine at this time

110
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:05,262
was not very, very big.

111
00:07:05,682 --> 00:07:12,747
So I thought that I need some 3D backgrounds.

112
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:18,788
but which were not made with polygons. So, uh, I had the idea,

113
00:07:18,808 --> 00:07:24,071
I can take pictures of a real mansion, an old one, and then

114
00:07:24,171 --> 00:07:29,033
made my 3D fits on those picture to have those, uh, 3D, uh,

115
00:07:29,413 --> 00:07:33,896
characters, uh, inside the, uh, the game. Actually, you, you

116
00:07:33,936 --> 00:07:37,217
know the game, it's not like this at the end, and, uh, you

117
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:38,078
will see, uh, why.

118
00:07:42,889 --> 00:07:47,153
OK, so I had at Infogrames a good friend who was named Didier

119
00:07:47,253 --> 00:07:50,877
Chamfret, and I explained him my vision of the game.

120
00:07:51,638 --> 00:07:56,883
3D zombies in a house, and you need to get out and fight

121
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:59,205
monsters in this adventure game.

122
00:07:59,366 --> 00:08:01,568
And Didier did this drawing.

123
00:08:02,289 --> 00:08:05,152
And this is really the first.

124
00:08:06,295 --> 00:08:11,259
thing that was done on Alone in the Dark, and this was very a good inspiration.

125
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:18,325
I kept, we kept this drawing above my desk for the world development, each time somebody

126
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:21,648
was asking, you are working on what, say, at this look.

127
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:27,733
And actually Infogrames didn't really believe in it at this time.

128
00:08:29,054 --> 00:08:35,979
So, for the first time of my life, because I did games for the previous 10 years before,

129
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:42,063
it was the first time where the amount of work seems very huge, because...

130
00:08:42,664 --> 00:08:45,766
Usually, you think about the game with a few sprites and everything.

131
00:08:45,806 --> 00:08:49,549
You do a quick prototype in two hours to see how the game works.

132
00:08:50,010 --> 00:08:53,392
But I needed things that just didn't exist at this time.

133
00:08:54,353 --> 00:08:57,215
3D characters, articulation, it means tools.

134
00:08:57,656 --> 00:08:57,716
So

135
00:08:59,797 --> 00:09:01,820
I started my first tool.

136
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:06,084
I needed a 3D modeler, but we were early 90s.

137
00:09:06,104 --> 00:09:08,327
I never saw a professional modeler.

138
00:09:08,847 --> 00:09:11,410
Modelers that existed at this time

139
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:16,015
were quite simple with those three views to edit a few things.

140
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:16,195
So.

141
00:09:17,358 --> 00:09:21,160
I needed mine, so I said, OK, let's do a modeler.

142
00:09:21,661 --> 00:09:26,504
And as I told you, I was so obsessed by this 3D rotating

143
00:09:26,564 --> 00:09:30,186
cube that I decided to make my own editor.

144
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:32,387
And in this editor, you

145
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:35,279
edit your mesh.

146
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:38,962
But in just one 3D view, everything

147
00:09:39,042 --> 00:09:41,444
is based on this rotated cube.

148
00:09:41,724 --> 00:09:46,808
And you can move a grid inside of it, placing your points,

149
00:09:47,108 --> 00:09:49,970
drawing lines, and polygon.

150
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,311
The tool was in EGA mode.

151
00:09:52,391 --> 00:09:54,933
For those who know the PC at this time,

152
00:09:54,993 --> 00:09:56,694
it was a high resolution mode, 640 by 350.

153
00:09:56,754 --> 00:09:57,975
Pixels were not square.

154
00:10:02,241 --> 00:10:07,944
And these tools allow us to create the model of the game,

155
00:10:08,265 --> 00:10:10,306
the object, the characters, and everything.

156
00:10:11,246 --> 00:10:15,629
Put not texture, because it was flat polygons.

157
00:10:15,689 --> 00:10:20,392
But I did some kind of materials on them to be able

158
00:10:20,432 --> 00:10:23,033
to have a little bit of variety for them.

159
00:10:23,653 --> 00:10:27,376
And with this tool, you can also edit real-time animation.

160
00:10:27,916 --> 00:10:30,918
Again, I'll be back on this later.

161
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:42,311
So I needed also another tool, a tool to be able to edit the backgrounds, actually, to

162
00:10:42,431 --> 00:10:47,817
put collisions and to make fit my 3D function on the picture.

163
00:10:49,539 --> 00:10:55,163
Because, as I told you, I was sure that I cannot use polygons for the background, because

164
00:10:55,183 --> 00:11:01,707
it was not, I couldn't put enough polygons to have a very nice north scenery.

165
00:11:02,448 --> 00:11:08,472
So I did this tool to, where you were able to put some wireframe cubes in it, trying

166
00:11:08,552 --> 00:11:14,576
to make them, to make the collision fits to the, on the imported pictures.

167
00:11:15,217 --> 00:11:21,360
Something that you need also to remember is that in 91, digital camera didn't exist.

168
00:11:21,861 --> 00:11:24,923
So we had to take picture with a real camera.

169
00:11:25,343 --> 00:11:27,084
Then I've done scanned.

170
00:11:27,744 --> 00:11:29,946
We had one scanner in Infogrames.

171
00:11:30,566 --> 00:11:32,367
So, and then try to...

172
00:11:33,113 --> 00:11:35,313
make my routines fit.

173
00:11:35,353 --> 00:11:41,274
But my 3D projection system was very, very too simple.

174
00:11:41,434 --> 00:11:45,075
And with the camera and the wide angle

175
00:11:45,135 --> 00:11:49,876
needed to have some nice large enough view,

176
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:54,357
it was really not possible with the policy.

177
00:11:54,417 --> 00:11:58,277
So what I thought at this time, say, OK,

178
00:11:59,117 --> 00:12:01,198
I need undrawn backgrounds.

179
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:10,216
And so, the tool, Sanedit, which was meant for, put the collision on real pictures,

180
00:12:10,336 --> 00:12:16,381
actually was used to create the rooms of the room.

181
00:12:17,842 --> 00:12:20,944
And you see how it works just after.

182
00:12:21,903 --> 00:12:25,147
At this time, at Infograms 2, they had a trainee programmer.

183
00:12:25,568 --> 00:12:27,330
They didn't know what to do with him.

184
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,112
Say, OK, do you need somebody?

185
00:12:29,132 --> 00:12:30,434
Say, OK, great.

186
00:12:31,175 --> 00:12:32,116
Give me Frank.

187
00:12:32,316 --> 00:12:35,800
And Frank DeGiulami worked on this tool.

188
00:12:36,101 --> 00:12:36,241
And

189
00:12:39,155 --> 00:12:42,779
It will be the project manager for the second one.

190
00:12:42,919 --> 00:12:45,982
But OK, we are preview of that.

191
00:12:46,802 --> 00:12:49,465
So as you see here on the screen,

192
00:12:49,745 --> 00:12:52,748
that's the kind of view that Senedit generated.

193
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:59,154
It was a wire-frame cube describing the collisions

194
00:12:59,214 --> 00:13:02,176
and all the walls and floor of the room.

195
00:13:03,250 --> 00:13:09,534
And it was not an official project at this time at Infogrames, so I was just working

196
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:10,195
on my idea.

197
00:13:10,415 --> 00:13:11,395
I didn't believe in it.

198
00:13:12,016 --> 00:13:13,297
And so I had an idea.

199
00:13:13,317 --> 00:13:20,362
I created with this tool the first room, actually not the first room of the game, a room for

200
00:13:20,622 --> 00:13:21,082
testing.

201
00:13:22,643 --> 00:13:26,946
And I put those four camera views on a floppy disk.

202
00:13:27,915 --> 00:13:32,437
And I gave it to all the artists, to the artists in Infogrames,

203
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:36,539
telling them, OK, I want to work with somebody who

204
00:13:36,579 --> 00:13:38,140
is really motivated.

205
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,141
So it's not official.

206
00:13:40,261 --> 00:13:42,422
It's not from the direction, just from myself.

207
00:13:42,622 --> 00:13:47,744
If after the work you want to draw something with that,

208
00:13:48,545 --> 00:13:49,085
just do it.

209
00:13:49,105 --> 00:13:51,666
I explained to them that, OK.

210
00:13:52,792 --> 00:13:55,353
Obviously they didn't see those pictures at this time.

211
00:13:55,833 --> 00:13:58,675
I explained to them, OK, it's like a kid coloring sheet.

212
00:14:00,375 --> 00:14:01,416
Use your Deluxe Paint.

213
00:14:01,476 --> 00:14:03,157
We used Deluxe Paint at this time.

214
00:14:03,497 --> 00:14:04,958
Photoshop didn't exist, too.

215
00:14:05,578 --> 00:14:12,021
And I asked them to make things because I was also very worried about the integration.

216
00:14:12,201 --> 00:14:14,542
When you have 3D characters, low res.

217
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:19,804
flat polygons, and I wanted to have them very well integrated.

218
00:14:20,104 --> 00:14:23,966
So I asked them, okay, you put colors on the wall,

219
00:14:24,046 --> 00:14:26,527
try to have the maximum of flat surfaces,

220
00:14:26,847 --> 00:14:30,768
but with a lot of details to make the picture

221
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,369
look like a real picture.

222
00:14:36,568 --> 00:14:42,311
So I explained that. And actually, just two of them gave me an answer.

223
00:14:44,071 --> 00:14:47,693
You need to know that Infogrames was 35 people at this time.

224
00:14:48,213 --> 00:14:50,254
So it was not a huge company.

225
00:14:51,034 --> 00:14:56,156
A guy gave me some background which looked like Prince of Persia.

226
00:14:56,176 --> 00:14:58,857
It didn't fit the ambience I wanted.

227
00:14:59,557 --> 00:15:00,598
And Yael Barrows.

228
00:15:01,498 --> 00:15:07,320
We did those four pictures, the four first pictures of the prototype of the game.

229
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,581
She came from a real art school.

230
00:15:11,082 --> 00:15:19,845
Same thing, at this time, school for video games or for digital graphics didn't exist.

231
00:15:20,445 --> 00:15:23,226
But in this school, they had an Amiga.

232
00:15:23,907 --> 00:15:25,187
And when she saw...

233
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:29,243
video games of this time with tiles and sprites,

234
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:30,263
eight colors and everything.

235
00:15:30,844 --> 00:15:33,364
She was also convinced that there is something

236
00:15:33,424 --> 00:15:35,945
to do better with video games.

237
00:15:36,425 --> 00:15:38,986
So for her, it was the perfect fit.

238
00:15:39,566 --> 00:15:40,747
So she worked.

239
00:15:42,147 --> 00:15:44,108
Actually, she went back to school

240
00:15:44,828 --> 00:15:47,649
because I also had a PC at this time, too.

241
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,470
And something that you need to know

242
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:54,071
that she became my wife and the mother of my children.

243
00:16:00,805 --> 00:16:04,486
Okay, so now I have 3D backgrounds with collisions.

244
00:16:05,647 --> 00:16:08,787
I didn't find back the wireframe of those pictures, sadly.

245
00:16:09,347 --> 00:16:15,749
Okay, so I started to make my first hero, because I needed a hero to put in those background

246
00:16:15,769 --> 00:16:16,269
pictures.

247
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,890
It was called MainZero.

248
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:21,791
It was my crash test dummy.

249
00:16:22,931 --> 00:16:29,934
It was very, very simple because I needed something very, very quickly to just test

250
00:16:30,214 --> 00:16:30,814
can it work.

251
00:16:31,514 --> 00:16:38,397
And that was, so what you are seeing here is the first hero of Alone in the Dark.

252
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:40,538
made with my tools.

253
00:16:40,958 --> 00:16:44,060
This is the animation part of the tool.

254
00:16:44,320 --> 00:16:47,422
Actually, this animation was never put in the game

255
00:16:47,462 --> 00:16:50,804
because you cannot run like this in a house.

256
00:16:51,304 --> 00:16:53,466
But it allows to edit.

257
00:16:53,586 --> 00:16:56,207
I'll be back on how it works after,

258
00:16:56,267 --> 00:16:58,929
because that's very important for.

259
00:17:00,034 --> 00:17:08,642
for the game. So now I have 3D backgrounds, I have a 3D hero, so let's make the first

260
00:17:08,782 --> 00:17:16,970
prototype of Alone in the Dark. We were in September 91, and actually it works. I have

261
00:17:17,010 --> 00:17:21,354
a 3D character that can direct control with the keyboard.

262
00:17:22,055 --> 00:17:29,320
the interface of the PC game at this time were just keyboard driven. Some joystick existed,

263
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:36,485
but there were more intended for flight simulators or things like that. So it was all controlled

264
00:17:36,525 --> 00:17:46,112
by the keyboard. SunEdit also allowed to edit all the mask that is put. There is no Z-buffer.

265
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:48,353
This is a 2D picture. So I...

266
00:17:51,156 --> 00:17:58,181
You had a zone on the floor that tells which picture you need to put in front of the characters.

267
00:17:58,721 --> 00:18:02,965
And the camera switching used this zone too.

268
00:18:03,545 --> 00:18:05,466
But it worked.

269
00:18:05,807 --> 00:18:09,269
I have my character working in this room.

270
00:18:11,239 --> 00:18:14,881
Actually, we learned a lot from this demo,

271
00:18:14,941 --> 00:18:18,123
because you can see the camera are not very efficient.

272
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:22,526
This one is fine, but some of them, you have too much walls

273
00:18:22,606 --> 00:18:24,227
or too much ceiling.

274
00:18:24,608 --> 00:18:26,409
And I understood at this time that it

275
00:18:26,489 --> 00:18:29,091
was more important to put the camera in the game.

276
00:18:29,811 --> 00:18:36,914
showing the biggest part of the ground to give to the player a good vision of where

277
00:18:36,994 --> 00:18:39,355
it can go and what it can do in this.

278
00:18:39,735 --> 00:18:40,395
Oh, yes.

279
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:43,856
Did you see that window and the bird coming in?

280
00:18:44,316 --> 00:18:47,197
I don't know where this idea came from.

281
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,418
Maybe it was Hitchcock movie.

282
00:18:50,459 --> 00:18:54,241
I don't know, but I wanted to have monsters coming in from windows.

283
00:18:54,301 --> 00:19:00,784
So if in another game you see a dog coming in through the window, remember these 12 polygon

284
00:19:00,844 --> 00:19:05,046
birds breaking the first 3D window in the game.

285
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:11,529
We also learned from this demo to avoid to have a shot, reverse shot camera, because

286
00:19:11,589 --> 00:19:14,591
it was very disturbing for the player.

287
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:16,732
So it was working.

288
00:19:18,462 --> 00:19:22,527
And then I showed that to Infogram and said, OK, look,

289
00:19:22,708 --> 00:19:28,114
that's what I am thinking about for this game.

290
00:19:28,495 --> 00:19:30,698
And they say, OK, great.

291
00:19:30,718 --> 00:19:32,460
The concept was approved.

292
00:19:33,541 --> 00:19:35,783
I had my home team for the first time.

293
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:40,406
Obviously, Didier Chamfret, who worked on the black and white

294
00:19:40,426 --> 00:19:44,368
picture you saw, Yael Barros, and Frank DeGirolami, who

295
00:19:44,389 --> 00:19:48,171
became integrated inside the team.

296
00:19:49,052 --> 00:19:55,856
I asked Infogrames to have plans, old mentions from those

297
00:19:55,976 --> 00:19:59,259
old years, and they provided me Frank Manzetti.

298
00:20:00,379 --> 00:20:02,041
I worked a few days.

299
00:20:03,584 --> 00:20:08,395
with him making the plane of the mansion, the full plane.

300
00:20:10,498 --> 00:20:12,960
So Didier is involved in the team now.

301
00:20:13,560 --> 00:20:18,262
So now I have a 2D artist that became a 3D artist

302
00:20:18,863 --> 00:20:19,723
for the first time.

303
00:20:20,323 --> 00:20:23,565
So he did the second hero of the game.

304
00:20:23,785 --> 00:20:26,846
It's called Main 2, because the first one was Main 0,

305
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,568
because the number came from a programmer.

306
00:20:29,988 --> 00:20:32,509
And Main 2 is the second one, because it was

307
00:20:32,569 --> 00:20:34,770
numbered by an artist.

308
00:20:37,872 --> 00:20:43,637
So, um, as you can see here, uh, I don't remember the exact amount of polygon.

309
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,259
I think it's 140 polygons.

310
00:20:46,399 --> 00:20:47,640
That was so huge.

311
00:20:47,800 --> 00:20:51,123
I did, wasn't sure that, uh, it was not too much.

312
00:20:51,803 --> 00:20:56,888
Uh, as you can see here, the way of animated character, it was not a hierarchy of object.

313
00:20:57,648 --> 00:20:59,310
It was a hierarchy of points.

314
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:04,414
Actually, one mesh was just a big, big, a cloud of points.

315
00:21:06,276 --> 00:21:14,044
Each point was attached to a group, and the rotation of each group was another point from that cloud.

316
00:21:15,466 --> 00:21:24,436
This is the first polygon hero with the flat shaded polygon and some kind of materials.

317
00:21:25,703 --> 00:21:30,286
the chest of the hero to have some variety for that.

318
00:21:31,207 --> 00:21:34,409
Let's load an animation.

319
00:21:34,429 --> 00:21:41,014
I've chosen this animation because it's a very special souvenir to me.

320
00:21:41,634 --> 00:21:47,639
We were walking with Didier, and, okay, I want that the character is able to walk, but

321
00:21:47,699 --> 00:21:49,880
I want also him to be able to run.

322
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:53,142
And Didier said, how do you run in a house?

323
00:21:53,583 --> 00:21:54,223
And I show him.

324
00:21:55,433 --> 00:22:01,415
running between the desks in the company.

325
00:22:01,955 --> 00:22:04,576
And he did that just to have fun of me.

326
00:22:05,536 --> 00:22:07,197
He said, you are running like this.

327
00:22:07,217 --> 00:22:08,277
I said, OK, thank you.

328
00:22:08,517 --> 00:22:08,857
Thank you.

329
00:22:08,917 --> 00:22:09,577
Thank you very much.

330
00:22:09,677 --> 00:22:12,558
But actually, in the final game, the animation

331
00:22:12,638 --> 00:22:14,339
is not very different than this one.

332
00:22:14,379 --> 00:22:16,019
He tried to make it less funny.

333
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:20,080
So that's my way of running, they said.

334
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:26,704
Okay, just to show you how the tool works, each time you click on a part of the body,

335
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:33,968
it selected the group, and then you can modify the three angles, because all the mathematic

336
00:22:34,048 --> 00:22:38,871
functions were trigonometry, not matrix at this time, so it was just a dream matrix.

337
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:47,192
So you can, like an articulated puppet, put all the position of the body.

338
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:54,114
I wanted to have this, obviously to have animation, but something also that you need to know that

339
00:22:54,134 --> 00:22:56,855
in early 90s, pieces were...

340
00:22:58,555 --> 00:23:01,616
slow, but we are evolving very, very quickly.

341
00:23:01,916 --> 00:23:04,076
So you have a lot of big differences

342
00:23:04,256 --> 00:23:05,857
in speed between computers.

343
00:23:06,317 --> 00:23:09,577
So I decided to have this system to be

344
00:23:09,637 --> 00:23:13,758
able to adapt that for the animation system

345
00:23:13,798 --> 00:23:15,919
to adapt itself to the speed of the computer.

346
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:17,419
So if you have a very slow computer,

347
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,359
you just have the basic frames.

348
00:23:19,879 --> 00:23:22,480
And here I just modified it a little bit

349
00:23:22,560 --> 00:23:25,140
to show you that you can put the time you

350
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:27,521
want between the frames.

351
00:23:29,437 --> 00:23:36,020
So it was very very convenient because if you have a very very fast PC, you have very very smooth and nice

352
00:23:36,220 --> 00:23:36,900
animations

353
00:23:38,081 --> 00:23:43,103
This animation is just four frames. That was also so convenient for the memory

354
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:49,646
Didier did also the first monster of the game. It was a kind of zombie chicken

355
00:23:50,506 --> 00:23:54,248
I don't know exactly what it is.

356
00:23:55,529 --> 00:24:00,472
Also, the sphere were very convenient to give some volume to the object

357
00:24:00,532 --> 00:24:04,514
without using too much polygon, because I was very hard on him,

358
00:24:04,554 --> 00:24:05,995
saying, no, no, it's too much polygon.

359
00:24:06,055 --> 00:24:08,336
It was always too much polygon.

360
00:24:08,757 --> 00:24:11,758
And look at this attack animation for this monster.

361
00:24:11,858 --> 00:24:13,499
It's just three frames.

362
00:24:14,360 --> 00:24:17,883
So it means in memory, I don't remember exactly, 40 bytes.

363
00:24:18,943 --> 00:24:20,405
That was so, so cool.

364
00:24:20,685 --> 00:24:24,268
We were very, very happy with what we saw at this time.

365
00:24:24,308 --> 00:24:27,830
That was so, so new, so impressive.

366
00:24:28,271 --> 00:24:31,033
That was very, very cool.

367
00:24:31,833 --> 00:24:38,679
Okay, so now I have a real hero, real monsters, some plain...

368
00:24:39,908 --> 00:24:41,189
for the, for the mention.

369
00:24:41,629 --> 00:24:47,033
So I also needed, I'll be quick on that, I needed a scripting language, because something

370
00:24:47,493 --> 00:24:54,378
I understood very, very soon is that, uh, as I was the main programmer and, uh, alone,

371
00:24:55,239 --> 00:25:00,163
uh, I need to separate work between, uh, people who produce the content of the game and, uh,

372
00:25:00,663 --> 00:25:03,846
people who are programming the engine itself.

373
00:25:03,886 --> 00:25:07,830
So I did this kind of object-interpreted language.

374
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:12,134
But it helps me also to understand something.

375
00:25:12,494 --> 00:25:16,177
With 3Desk, Senedit, and my scripting language,

376
00:25:16,638 --> 00:25:18,259
I understood that if you do...

377
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:26,506
for a game. And it's still true nowadays. Dedicated tools, it's very, very efficient

378
00:25:26,626 --> 00:25:34,353
because it helps, because it keeps the direction, because every artist working on the game,

379
00:25:34,813 --> 00:25:41,299
you give them the maximum freedom, but inside the constraint you want and inside the direction

380
00:25:41,339 --> 00:25:46,744
you want. So if you have a lot of dedicated tools to a game, it helps to keep the vision.

381
00:25:47,384 --> 00:25:53,748
and the efficiency too, because the tool provides exactly the data you need for the game.

382
00:25:54,569 --> 00:26:03,895
So we were working, and we are now in December 91, and this is the first room you know in

383
00:26:03,935 --> 00:26:08,278
the game, the first room you see in the final game.

384
00:26:09,739 --> 00:26:12,721
But here you can, for the first time, we had fives.

385
00:26:12,861 --> 00:26:13,141
Yes.

386
00:26:13,181 --> 00:26:14,582
It runs well.

387
00:26:15,363 --> 00:26:15,483
Yeah.

388
00:26:16,425 --> 00:26:17,486
That's wonderful.

389
00:26:17,506 --> 00:26:21,048
OK, so you can push object.

390
00:26:21,208 --> 00:26:25,110
Monster can see you, detect you, attacks you.

391
00:26:25,150 --> 00:26:29,652
The camera switching system was working quite nicely.

392
00:26:29,672 --> 00:26:33,474
The monster can attack you.

393
00:26:33,514 --> 00:26:39,357
You will see here the first fight, manual fight system.

394
00:26:40,337 --> 00:26:43,340
Yes, there is, yeah, can give punch.

395
00:26:43,540 --> 00:26:47,643
And also this animation, which was removed, this one,

396
00:26:47,883 --> 00:26:49,805
but not very, very elegant.

397
00:26:51,726 --> 00:26:53,848
But it just, it works.

398
00:26:54,388 --> 00:26:55,749
You can fight monsters.

399
00:26:56,310 --> 00:26:58,251
And you can have this camera switching.

400
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,953
The game was really here.

401
00:27:00,513 --> 00:27:02,355
There is no OSD on the tool.

402
00:27:02,455 --> 00:27:04,236
Yeah, OSD here, it's for the debug mode,

403
00:27:04,276 --> 00:27:05,797
just to show you some collision.

404
00:27:07,216 --> 00:27:11,278
a little bit of the underground of the game.

405
00:27:11,798 --> 00:27:13,779
And I didn't want any USD.

406
00:27:13,799 --> 00:27:16,520
That was the inspiration from the movie.

407
00:27:16,840 --> 00:27:18,821
And I say, I don't want you just play the game.

408
00:27:18,921 --> 00:27:19,942
You're inside the house.

409
00:27:20,002 --> 00:27:21,783
I want that you are completely immersed.

410
00:27:22,763 --> 00:27:26,865
Your life points and inventory system was another screen.

411
00:27:27,625 --> 00:27:32,388
But when you play, you just have the 3D vision of the game.

412
00:27:34,216 --> 00:27:39,138
Uh, so here you can see the, the, the, um, in the, the orange lines are the collision

413
00:27:39,258 --> 00:27:42,139
artists have to, to draw the, the backgrounds.

414
00:27:42,779 --> 00:27:47,881
And uh, you can see the, the, the small box for the hit detection when, uh, when you,

415
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:48,541
you fight.

416
00:27:48,561 --> 00:27:54,023
There was, uh, the, those, um, the collision boxes were attached to some group.

417
00:27:54,443 --> 00:28:00,505
So it allows to have very different kind of, um, of, um, attacks for the, the, the game.

418
00:28:02,125 --> 00:28:02,405
Okay.

419
00:28:06,528 --> 00:28:10,650
Call of Cthulhu, because Alone in the Dark is very often...

420
00:28:11,450 --> 00:28:13,351
Um...

421
00:28:13,411 --> 00:28:14,972
Compared...

422
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:17,913
A lot of people say that the inspiration is Call of Cthulhu.

423
00:28:17,973 --> 00:28:21,074
Actually, the inspiration, as I told you, was more the movie.

424
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:24,115
But the story of Call of Cthulhu is interesting,

425
00:28:24,155 --> 00:28:26,516
because I asked to Infogrames,

426
00:28:26,596 --> 00:28:28,537
OK, I need a writer, because, OK,

427
00:28:28,797 --> 00:28:30,118
you see here, it's an action game,

428
00:28:30,138 --> 00:28:32,079
but I don't want to do an action game.

429
00:28:32,199 --> 00:28:34,320
Alone in the Dark is not an action game.

430
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,060
It's an adventure game with...

431
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,021
a few action in it.

432
00:28:38,061 --> 00:28:40,062
So I needed those text,

433
00:28:40,162 --> 00:28:42,503
so I need a very good writer.

434
00:28:43,423 --> 00:28:49,005
At this time, Infogrames was talking with Causium,

435
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:51,246
which owned the Call of Cthulhu license,

436
00:28:51,786 --> 00:28:52,466
and they asked me,

437
00:28:52,626 --> 00:28:56,287
is Call of Cthulhu something that interesting you for the game, Lovecraft?

438
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,588
I say, okay, Lovecraft, just perfect.

439
00:28:59,829 --> 00:29:01,989
I knew the books of him.

440
00:29:02,890 --> 00:29:06,612
But please, no Call of Cthulhu, because as I told you,

441
00:29:07,972 --> 00:29:10,213
the character sheets were so awful.

442
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,514
So they gave me Hubert Chardot.

443
00:29:13,615 --> 00:29:15,596
He never worked on a game before.

444
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:19,598
He was a good writer. He knew very well Lovecraft.

445
00:29:21,096 --> 00:29:24,699
and he's very, uh, talented. So, uh, we start to work with, uh,

446
00:29:25,079 --> 00:29:29,964
with the, uh, Uber. The license was refused by Chaosium. They

447
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:32,686
say, no, it's not Call of Cthulhu. I know it's not Call of

448
00:29:32,706 --> 00:29:36,809
Cthulhu. I don't want to have any character sheet, uh, in it.

449
00:29:37,310 --> 00:29:39,952
And, uh, so they say it's too far from the RPG. Say, yes, I

450
00:29:39,992 --> 00:29:44,896
know, but this is an adventure game. I, it's not an RPG, uh,

451
00:29:45,016 --> 00:29:45,797
an RPG game.

452
00:29:47,987 --> 00:29:52,073
So the team now, we have a writer, we have 2D artists, we have...

453
00:29:53,755 --> 00:30:00,223
we were maybe 6 or 7 people at this time, that was the full team.

454
00:30:01,064 --> 00:30:03,488
And so we were ready to be able to...

455
00:30:04,289 --> 00:30:06,411
to put the content of the game.

456
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,674
So we did a very famous thing.

457
00:30:08,774 --> 00:30:12,518
Everybody in the team remember that so well,

458
00:30:13,019 --> 00:30:14,721
this three-day meeting.

459
00:30:15,922 --> 00:30:18,205
The whole team was in the same room.

460
00:30:18,545 --> 00:30:19,887
We ate a lot of pizza.

461
00:30:20,748 --> 00:30:27,553
And I did it as a game master, say, okay, because I knew, I had the plan of the mansion.

462
00:30:28,553 --> 00:30:32,657
I knew what kind of action, what kind of puzzle, things I wanted in the game.

463
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:38,761
So I played it as a game master with them, say, okay, we are in the attic.

464
00:30:39,121 --> 00:30:44,666
I want to start the game in the attic, because you need to go out of the game.

465
00:30:44,726 --> 00:30:45,366
So I asked Hubert.

466
00:30:45,967 --> 00:30:48,609
find me something to explain why you start in the attic.

467
00:30:49,230 --> 00:30:51,071
And it was the same way of working each time.

468
00:30:51,191 --> 00:30:52,592
OK, now we have this monster.

469
00:30:53,373 --> 00:30:56,576
OK, you cannot kill him with your hands or with a gun.

470
00:30:56,976 --> 00:31:01,180
You need to find this statuette or this special knife.

471
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,802
Right in this book you find here,

472
00:31:04,163 --> 00:31:08,426
you need to put this clue of the way of passing this monster

473
00:31:08,647 --> 00:31:10,808
or this part of the game.

474
00:31:11,129 --> 00:31:11,889
So everybody.

475
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:16,311
of the team took notes about what they have to do,

476
00:31:16,511 --> 00:31:19,292
all the list of all animation, all monsters,

477
00:31:19,613 --> 00:31:22,954
all book that need to be written, and everything.

478
00:31:23,054 --> 00:31:25,035
So after those three days,

479
00:31:25,555 --> 00:31:27,596
we had the whole red thread of the game

480
00:31:27,736 --> 00:31:30,557
from the start to the end of the game.

481
00:31:30,937 --> 00:31:34,899
Everybody knew what they have to do for the few months

482
00:31:35,639 --> 00:31:37,219
that still...

483
00:31:39,147 --> 00:31:41,108
needed to make the game advance.

484
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:43,669
This was very, very memorable.

485
00:31:43,689 --> 00:31:48,450
Hubert Chardot said a few times later

486
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:51,692
that he learned his job in three days,

487
00:31:52,152 --> 00:31:53,672
because he saw everything.

488
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,653
Because he didn't know how worked a game.

489
00:31:56,693 --> 00:32:00,455
And he said, OK, so how many animation you need,

490
00:32:00,475 --> 00:32:03,456
how many characters, how many plays, how many everything.

491
00:32:03,896 --> 00:32:06,477
Three days for the world game.

492
00:32:07,947 --> 00:32:16,997
The production team ground up a bit too, because the total amount of background in the game

493
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:21,823
of 3D camera views was 170 views.

494
00:32:22,203 --> 00:32:25,127
It was too much for just one artist, Jean-Marc Torrella.

495
00:32:26,167 --> 00:32:29,548
Uh, and Frederic Bourgin, uh, joined the team.

496
00:32:29,688 --> 00:32:33,530
Jean-Marc did, uh, almost all the caves, uh, under the, the ground.

497
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:37,051
And Philippe Vaché also came us for the music.

498
00:32:37,392 --> 00:32:44,635
Something you need to know also, at the beginning of the 90s, uh, PCs, uh, were not very good

499
00:32:44,695 --> 00:32:45,615
for doing sounds.

500
00:32:45,975 --> 00:32:46,736
You have the buzzer.

501
00:32:47,396 --> 00:32:55,042
was not very efficient. You have some Adlib FM calls with three channels FM chip. Again,

502
00:32:55,102 --> 00:33:03,029
for instance, Alpha Waves, all the sound effects are done with these FM chips. But early 90s,

503
00:33:03,609 --> 00:33:09,134
the SunBlaster just arrived. That was so amazing.

504
00:33:10,055 --> 00:33:13,337
Especially for a game like this, because we can do samples,

505
00:33:13,578 --> 00:33:16,019
real samples for the first time on PC.

506
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:20,243
So for all the squeaks of the steps, when you open door,

507
00:33:20,363 --> 00:33:23,145
all the scream of the monster and everything,

508
00:33:23,685 --> 00:33:28,049
it helped so much to have a realistic ambience

509
00:33:28,069 --> 00:33:29,130
and game at this time.

510
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:32,572
That was very, very something very important.

511
00:33:33,353 --> 00:33:34,554
for the game.

512
00:33:35,234 --> 00:33:38,577
OK, let me just do a quick step to the end of the game,

513
00:33:38,957 --> 00:33:41,719
because there is something quite funny that happened.

514
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:45,402
I don't know if you noticed in all the videos and pictures

515
00:33:45,422 --> 00:33:51,867
you saw for now, is that all the characters you saw just

516
00:33:51,988 --> 00:33:53,649
have a sphere for the head.

517
00:33:54,991 --> 00:33:59,672
Yes, we were in September 92, uh, master state,

518
00:34:00,272 --> 00:34:03,193
but we still have no head for the hero.

519
00:34:03,593 --> 00:34:06,453
Because since the beginning, I told Didier

520
00:34:06,773 --> 00:34:11,174
when he created the characters and monster and everything,

521
00:34:11,194 --> 00:34:14,615
he said, I will have a voxel head system.

522
00:34:14,635 --> 00:34:16,275
You see, it will be just marvelous

523
00:34:16,315 --> 00:34:18,376
with a lot of details for the head.

524
00:34:18,716 --> 00:34:21,096
We can have animation on heads and everything.

525
00:34:21,376 --> 00:34:23,517
But I never had the time to do it.

526
00:34:23,997 --> 00:34:25,737
So we say, oh, we need something.

527
00:34:25,958 --> 00:34:28,218
Didier said, OK, let me take care of that.

528
00:34:28,759 --> 00:34:33,601
And he did 3D polygons for the head.

529
00:34:33,941 --> 00:34:36,922
That's why in the game, the head is very, very static.

530
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:39,443
There is not a lot of animation, because all the animation

531
00:34:39,483 --> 00:34:39,984
were done.

532
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:44,906
So we just quickly tried to reparse all the animation

533
00:34:44,926 --> 00:34:46,826
to add little movement for the head.

534
00:34:46,987 --> 00:34:50,208
But we were quite late.

535
00:34:50,568 --> 00:34:52,249
And well, this is very funny.

536
00:34:52,949 --> 00:34:57,372
This is that in April 92, Infogram asked me,

537
00:34:57,992 --> 00:34:59,974
we need visuals for the communication.

538
00:34:59,994 --> 00:35:03,096
I say, oh, you need visuals, but I have no head.

539
00:35:03,316 --> 00:35:04,036
OK, never mind.

540
00:35:04,056 --> 00:35:08,759
Didier and Yael drawn some with Photoshop.

541
00:35:08,959 --> 00:35:09,800
Sorry, Deluxe Paint.

542
00:35:12,022 --> 00:35:15,365
And drone head on the screenshot of the game.

543
00:35:15,785 --> 00:35:22,150
And that's very funny because if you still look on the first box of the game, the pictures

544
00:35:22,190 --> 00:35:26,394
at the end of the box are those pictures with a fake head on it.

545
00:35:26,794 --> 00:35:30,518
And even in the game, in the main menu, if you don't touch a key.

546
00:35:31,678 --> 00:35:36,562
you go to a slideshow and the picture in the slideshow are those pictures too.

547
00:35:36,842 --> 00:35:38,523
So they are not the same in the game.

548
00:35:39,064 --> 00:35:45,288
That's, we didn't have time or forget to modify those, those picture.

549
00:35:45,968 --> 00:35:54,354
Okay, so let's back to the game itself to, because why this game was the first name,

550
00:35:54,394 --> 00:35:57,396
the first, it was later actually, first survival horror.

551
00:35:59,450 --> 00:36:05,056
I had a lot of ideas about how to scare the player.

552
00:36:05,817 --> 00:36:09,881
I told you the main important stuff is the books, because imagination is stronger than

553
00:36:09,961 --> 00:36:10,381
polygon.

554
00:36:10,842 --> 00:36:18,809
So if you have this very, very heavy ambience, very dark story, so it helps to put this heavy

555
00:36:19,190 --> 00:36:20,111
ambience in the game.

556
00:36:20,551 --> 00:36:22,633
But I realized also something else.

557
00:36:23,053 --> 00:36:23,834
In an adventure game...

558
00:36:24,415 --> 00:36:26,756
You walk 80% of the time.

559
00:36:27,196 --> 00:36:31,517
And I say, oh, if you want to put big pressure on the player,

560
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:36,719
just scare him on what he does all the time.

561
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:37,740
Just walking.

562
00:36:37,800 --> 00:36:39,200
That's why in the first corridor,

563
00:36:39,761 --> 00:36:43,862
the sole cracked under your feet and you just die like this.

564
00:36:44,182 --> 00:36:45,423
Usually in the game, you never.

565
00:36:46,383 --> 00:36:49,964
do inviolable trap like this, but it was to put the pressure.

566
00:36:50,064 --> 00:36:53,945
It works so well. Testers, when they're playing, each time they saw a

567
00:36:53,985 --> 00:36:58,326
darker pixel somewhere, say, be careful, be careful! It just happened once in the game.

568
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:01,868
But now you are afraid of walking. It was the same thing for

569
00:37:02,428 --> 00:37:04,828
opening door, open a door, you have a monster

570
00:37:05,108 --> 00:37:08,970
just behind, okay, so now you'll be afraid for opening every doors.

571
00:37:09,350 --> 00:37:12,371
Same thing, even the books, you need to read the, you needed

572
00:37:12,671 --> 00:37:13,211
to read the...

573
00:37:14,052 --> 00:37:19,606
The the books in the game some books you just open them you die say okay

574
00:37:19,666 --> 00:37:21,470
You use a weapon in the game use it

575
00:37:22,575 --> 00:37:23,456
uh, it breaks.

576
00:37:23,756 --> 00:37:24,397
Say, whoa!

577
00:37:24,797 --> 00:37:26,258
And the limited inventory.

578
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:29,821
Because that's something also that, uh, it already existed in game.

579
00:37:29,841 --> 00:37:34,645
But I like this sphere because it's, each time you go to a trip, you make your, you

580
00:37:34,665 --> 00:37:35,666
pack your, your stuff.

581
00:37:35,966 --> 00:37:38,748
Say, oh, I don't need to forget that and to forget that.

582
00:37:39,209 --> 00:37:43,512
And that's something that, uh, you can do with limited inventory because sometimes you

583
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:46,795
have to put down some objects, so maybe I need them later.

584
00:37:46,915 --> 00:37:50,558
Okay, but you can go back and pick them up, um, again.

585
00:37:51,932 --> 00:37:56,014
And limited inventory means also limited ammunition.

586
00:37:56,635 --> 00:38:00,577
I know a lot of people say that the game was frightening

587
00:38:00,617 --> 00:38:03,239
because of the amount of ammunitions.

588
00:38:03,879 --> 00:38:09,142
But actually, it's not important,

589
00:38:09,282 --> 00:38:10,783
because this is an adventure game.

590
00:38:10,823 --> 00:38:12,965
This is not a shooter or a slasher.

591
00:38:13,425 --> 00:38:15,606
So you didn't need, actually, a lot of munition.

592
00:38:15,786 --> 00:38:17,407
I know it's very, um...

593
00:38:18,688 --> 00:38:22,950
It makes people more confident to have a big gun and everything.

594
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:29,432
But no, if you read all the book, you always have clues to kill a monster with just one

595
00:38:29,492 --> 00:38:29,772
action.

596
00:38:29,832 --> 00:38:32,773
It can be a dedicated object or a way of avoiding him.

597
00:38:33,574 --> 00:38:38,238
So actually you can finish the game with almost all the ammunition you can find in the game.

598
00:38:38,759 --> 00:38:45,345
But because I really wanted to force the player to find other solutions than just brutal force.

599
00:38:45,605 --> 00:38:48,948
It's not a shooter. It's an adventure game.

600
00:38:49,309 --> 00:38:51,290
And as I said, all clues are in the book.

601
00:38:51,631 --> 00:38:52,692
For instance, this room.

602
00:38:53,412 --> 00:38:56,314
I read some walkthroughs of the game, say,

603
00:38:56,394 --> 00:39:01,056
shoot quickly the six or five, uh, five zombies.

604
00:39:01,236 --> 00:39:03,637
No, just put a pot of soup on the table,

605
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:06,879
and they will go to eat, and you don't have to fight them.

606
00:39:07,199 --> 00:39:09,500
The fight with this knight is difficult

607
00:39:09,700 --> 00:39:10,981
because you need this sword.

608
00:39:11,501 --> 00:39:14,062
Okay, read the book, and you will learn the story

609
00:39:14,182 --> 00:39:18,904
why this knight can be easily killed with the statuette.

610
00:39:19,948 --> 00:39:25,410
This one is special in the game, the combat with the pirate.

611
00:39:25,870 --> 00:39:31,031
Because my animation system, OK, interpolates in between

612
00:39:31,091 --> 00:39:35,771
frames, but it also interpolates between animations.

613
00:39:36,272 --> 00:39:39,192
So I wanted this kind of special gameplay.

614
00:39:39,632 --> 00:39:43,233
The pirate actually got a parry animation for each

615
00:39:44,773 --> 00:39:47,714
animation you have, the right attack, the left attack.

616
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:55,181
But you can, with the keyboard, change whenever you want the animation, and the interpolation

617
00:39:55,221 --> 00:39:57,103
system creates all the animation.

618
00:39:57,483 --> 00:40:03,269
But the pirate doesn't know that, and he just has a full parry animation for the left and

619
00:40:03,309 --> 00:40:04,831
a full parry animation for the right.

620
00:40:05,091 --> 00:40:06,693
So the trick was, you just start.

621
00:40:07,654 --> 00:40:10,918
to attack from the right, and you fight it by going to the left,

622
00:40:10,938 --> 00:40:15,162
and the Pirate was continuing to protect itself on the wrong side,

623
00:40:15,683 --> 00:40:18,485
and it was in this way very easy to defeat.

624
00:40:19,246 --> 00:40:22,530
Some monsters were quickly killed with the gun,

625
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,633
but as I said, all clues were in books,

626
00:40:25,833 --> 00:40:30,318
so you can avoid or find easy solutions for a lot of monsters.

627
00:40:41,628 --> 00:40:44,971
Let's just have a look at some underground fights.

628
00:40:54,659 --> 00:40:55,940
This is the door.

629
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:59,424
Each time you die in the game killed by a monster,

630
00:41:00,164 --> 00:41:01,605
you can see this animation.

631
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:05,949
A zombie is dragging you to the sorcerer cave.

632
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:08,772
You can see quite often this animation.

633
00:41:10,956 --> 00:41:15,983
while playing. And it's something funny too, you will see just after why.

634
00:41:16,003 --> 00:41:24,535
Okay, so the final game, October 1912.

635
00:41:27,631 --> 00:41:33,396
Uh, everybody knows this picture because this is the first picture you see in the game when

636
00:41:33,436 --> 00:41:34,437
you run the game.

637
00:41:34,978 --> 00:41:40,763
And I like it very much because, um, in all the things I wanted in this game, there is

638
00:41:40,803 --> 00:41:43,145
also this detail, but I like it.

639
00:41:43,626 --> 00:41:46,849
You see the lamp at the bottom of the screen, the petrol lamp.

640
00:41:47,309 --> 00:41:52,054
And actually, this object is the one that is used at the end to kill the sorcerer.

641
00:41:52,534 --> 00:41:58,502
I just like this idea that the first object is the one you need to finish, uh, uh, finish

642
00:41:58,562 --> 00:41:59,983
the, um, the game.

643
00:42:00,924 --> 00:42:03,628
And uh, I have a confession, actually, to do.

644
00:42:04,068 --> 00:42:05,350
In October 92, I hated this game.

645
00:42:08,872 --> 00:42:12,515
Two years after, at the beginning, we were so excited.

646
00:42:12,616 --> 00:42:16,580
Everything was so new, so impressive.

647
00:42:16,660 --> 00:42:20,043
But two years after seeing those 3D characters inside,

648
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:21,705
nothing was new actually.

649
00:42:22,026 --> 00:42:25,930
But what I saw is what, OK, the trajectory, for instance,

650
00:42:25,970 --> 00:42:28,132
when you throw an object, just a line.

651
00:42:28,552 --> 00:42:30,174
It's not a well curve.

652
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:30,535
Because I

653
00:42:31,395 --> 00:42:36,498
quickly implemented it at the beginning, uh, just to, to go on the game. I never had time

654
00:42:36,558 --> 00:42:42,181
to modify it. And there is in the game, I can tell all of them, all the details in the game.

655
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:51,406
I say, wow, this is so bad done. Uh, and especially one thing I hated is that when the characters

656
00:42:52,107 --> 00:42:54,891
open the door, you have the camera on the side,

657
00:42:55,352 --> 00:42:59,857
but, and you cannot see the corridor or the room just in front of him,

658
00:43:00,358 --> 00:43:04,263
but the character himself just see what he's looking at,

659
00:43:04,683 --> 00:43:06,606
so you are afraid to go forward.

660
00:43:07,387 --> 00:43:11,049
But the characters, he sees if there is something or not.

661
00:43:11,630 --> 00:43:15,092
OK, but let me just read something from Lovecraft.

662
00:43:15,873 --> 00:43:19,956
Lovecraft said, the oldest and strongest emotion of mankind

663
00:43:20,016 --> 00:43:22,978
is fear, and the oldest and strongest kind of fear

664
00:43:23,098 --> 00:43:24,419
is the fear of the unknown.

665
00:43:24,439 --> 00:43:26,681
It's like, OK, so it's fine.

666
00:43:26,781 --> 00:43:30,824
You can see what's happening, so let's be afraid with that.

667
00:43:31,124 --> 00:43:34,867
But I really, really thought that people will laugh at me.

668
00:43:35,368 --> 00:43:37,310
Say, okay, your game is so stupid.

669
00:43:37,330 --> 00:43:39,413
That was really something.

670
00:43:40,425 --> 00:43:41,645
Yeah, it was the end of the game.

671
00:43:41,705 --> 00:43:44,106
Everybody was really, really tired and everything.

672
00:43:44,426 --> 00:43:45,647
And I was really afraid.

673
00:43:46,447 --> 00:43:49,388
The what happened to the game obviously

674
00:43:49,428 --> 00:43:50,529
made me change my mind.

675
00:43:51,089 --> 00:43:53,730
But that was really, really true this time.

676
00:43:54,810 --> 00:43:56,571
So we are almost done.

677
00:43:56,691 --> 00:43:59,152
Let me just show you, not the introduction of the game,

678
00:43:59,192 --> 00:44:00,933
because I think most of you have seen it.

679
00:44:01,113 --> 00:44:04,694
But let me show you the final sequence of the game

680
00:44:04,734 --> 00:44:05,675
and the end of the game.

681
00:44:12,095 --> 00:44:12,836
Sound, please.

682
00:44:15,176 --> 00:44:18,217
Not good resolution, sorry.

683
00:45:34,408 --> 00:45:40,734
recognize this door. You saw it so many times in the game and that's the way to exit the house

684
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:47,281
at the end. And other things I found funny at this time to use the same path you saw

685
00:45:47,381 --> 00:45:51,725
when you died each time in the game but now it's to reach the end of the game.

686
00:45:57,338 --> 00:46:01,421
Actually, you are not obliged to directly go to the exit,

687
00:46:01,761 --> 00:46:03,622
because the house now is empty.

688
00:46:04,023 --> 00:46:06,465
All the monsters died with the sorcerer.

689
00:46:06,985 --> 00:46:09,227
And so you can just go back in the house

690
00:46:09,287 --> 00:46:13,169
to visit all the rooms with no monster in it.

691
00:46:14,290 --> 00:46:19,414
But generally, the testers just wanted to get out.

692
00:46:20,775 --> 00:46:21,135
OK.

693
00:46:24,438 --> 00:46:25,498
And this is the real hand.

694
00:46:34,355 --> 00:46:36,637
I didn't do that animation.

695
00:46:58,642 --> 00:47:03,644
Obviously we had to do that. All the movies from the 70s did something like this.

696
00:47:06,905 --> 00:47:16,049
Okay, this is the end of the making of this game. Actually the team was not involved in the sequel

697
00:47:16,089 --> 00:47:22,032
of the game. We at this time did another company which was named Adlin Software, where we did

698
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:25,533
another game called Little Big Adventure. It was named Relentless here.

699
00:47:26,938 --> 00:47:28,339
Okay, thank you everybody.

700
00:47:42,650 --> 00:47:47,975
Okay, for the question, I want to ask a good friend of mine, Vincent, to join me just to

701
00:47:48,015 --> 00:47:49,896
be sure I understand well your question.

702
00:47:49,916 --> 00:47:53,559
Okay, if you have any question, please ask.

703
00:48:09,997 --> 00:48:11,658
Hey, two questions.

704
00:48:11,858 --> 00:48:14,399
First off, did you use any of those tools you designed

705
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:15,340
on additional games?

706
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:18,002
And second off, which was your favorite platform?

707
00:48:18,202 --> 00:48:21,224
Which platform actually got it, like, was the best port

708
00:48:21,264 --> 00:48:21,744
or the best PC version?

709
00:48:21,764 --> 00:48:21,904
Uh, yeah.

710
00:48:21,924 --> 00:48:24,546
The first question is, did you use any of those tools

711
00:48:24,586 --> 00:48:25,026
on additional games?

712
00:48:25,046 --> 00:48:28,688
And the second question is, which platform got it,

713
00:48:28,828 --> 00:48:29,389
which didn't?

714
00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:30,089
Favorite.

715
00:48:32,341 --> 00:48:37,326
Uh, okay, so for the tools, actually, uh, no, they, uh,

716
00:48:37,406 --> 00:48:41,050
belong, belonged, uh, belong to Infogrames.

717
00:48:41,270 --> 00:48:45,335
They use them for, uh, a lot in the Doc 2 and a lot in the Doc 3,

718
00:48:45,775 --> 00:48:47,237
but, uh, I didn't use them.

719
00:48:47,777 --> 00:48:55,244
But, you know, when we started our new game, the 386 existed at this time.

720
00:48:55,364 --> 00:48:58,947
So I redid everything in 32-bit mode.

721
00:48:59,027 --> 00:49:02,951
It was so more speed and so more efficient.

722
00:49:02,991 --> 00:49:05,593
So I never used them again.

723
00:49:05,713 --> 00:49:10,637
Actually, I used them last month for this presentation, but not for another game.

724
00:49:11,278 --> 00:49:13,260
And my best platform is the...

725
00:49:16,122 --> 00:49:26,332
I'm obliged to say the PC, because when I discovered the PC in 87, 88, I really felt

726
00:49:26,392 --> 00:49:30,816
in love with this machine, and so I really prefer the PC.

727
00:49:30,856 --> 00:49:37,001
But the ports are usually very, very well done, and it's very, very nice to see.

728
00:49:37,562 --> 00:49:40,024
But I prefer the PC version.

729
00:49:43,733 --> 00:49:50,800
How much did play-through iteration go into your puzzle

730
00:49:50,860 --> 00:49:51,420
challenges?

731
00:49:51,580 --> 00:49:54,903
Because I remember playing the game, and oh, the monster

732
00:49:54,944 --> 00:49:55,804
jumps out of the window.

733
00:49:55,904 --> 00:49:59,628
But hey, I can move that closet in front of the window

734
00:49:59,688 --> 00:50:00,249
and block it.

735
00:50:00,509 --> 00:50:02,971
But I only know that after it jumps out of the window and

736
00:50:02,991 --> 00:50:03,992
kills me the first time.

737
00:50:04,092 --> 00:50:08,096
How much did your challenge design revolve around repeated

738
00:50:08,156 --> 00:50:08,656
play-through?

739
00:50:09,782 --> 00:50:10,262
Uh, sorry.

740
00:50:10,302 --> 00:50:11,983
I was wondering, did you iterate a lot?

741
00:50:12,023 --> 00:50:13,503
Did you modify things?

742
00:50:13,543 --> 00:50:14,883
Or did you design directly?

743
00:50:14,923 --> 00:50:20,164
Did it work in the first place?

744
00:50:20,204 --> 00:50:24,785
Yeah, the way of working at this time was not the same as nowadays.

745
00:50:24,845 --> 00:50:29,166
Actually, the tests were done very, very late in the process.

746
00:50:29,346 --> 00:50:31,107
Testers were first us.

747
00:50:31,847 --> 00:50:32,547
And, uh, but...

748
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:36,991
I had the same idea during the whole development.

749
00:50:37,112 --> 00:50:42,818
So you need to find a way to be able to avoid, because if you are not good at fights, you

750
00:50:42,858 --> 00:50:43,679
need to find a way.

751
00:50:43,799 --> 00:50:48,504
So it was done since the first room to be able to push the...

752
00:50:49,024 --> 00:50:54,588
the wardrobe in front of the window or the chest on the hatch to avoid the monsters.

753
00:50:54,928 --> 00:51:00,832
Actually, I'm lying a little bit because some monsters don't have that in the game and you

754
00:51:00,852 --> 00:51:04,374
need to fight them because we didn't find a solution.

755
00:51:04,414 --> 00:51:08,717
But we didn't do a lot of iteration on it.

756
00:51:10,097 --> 00:51:18,319
If you look at the dates, the first prototype were at the end of 91.

757
00:51:18,759 --> 00:51:23,980
So we did the game in, let's say, the real content of the game in less than eight months.

758
00:51:24,461 --> 00:51:29,442
So we worked a lot, and we didn't ask a lot of questions.

759
00:51:29,462 --> 00:51:30,282
In fact, are you okay?

760
00:51:30,302 --> 00:51:30,662
It worked.

761
00:51:30,822 --> 00:51:31,562
Yeah, it worked.

762
00:51:32,202 --> 00:51:33,123
Okay, let's play it.

763
00:51:33,983 --> 00:51:34,283
Thanks.

764
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:39,284
My question would be, did you have a long phase where you just...

765
00:51:41,534 --> 00:51:47,803
did a concept like a pen and paper and designed the world or made a conscious decision where

766
00:51:47,844 --> 00:51:50,187
the story takes place in the world?

767
00:51:56,817 --> 00:52:00,240
Yeah, I told you that, the three days meeting.

768
00:52:00,420 --> 00:52:00,820
Three days.

769
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:02,441
This is really, yeah, this is three days.

770
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:04,303
We did the whole game.

771
00:52:04,643 --> 00:52:08,266
After, obviously, when Frank de Girolami, for instance,

772
00:52:08,306 --> 00:52:10,007
was involved in Sanedit, but also

773
00:52:10,687 --> 00:52:12,449
in the scripting of the game.

774
00:52:12,829 --> 00:52:17,552
So each time we test, but we just test ourselves.

775
00:52:17,612 --> 00:52:19,213
Say, OK, it works.

776
00:52:19,814 --> 00:52:22,836
It was like the idea from those three days.

777
00:52:23,196 --> 00:52:23,576
And say, OK.

778
00:52:25,097 --> 00:52:26,178
Let's have it like this.

779
00:52:26,198 --> 00:52:27,739
So the whole floor plan of the house

780
00:52:27,819 --> 00:52:30,260
was everything in three days?

781
00:52:30,940 --> 00:52:31,140
Yes.

782
00:52:31,740 --> 00:52:32,641
We modified a lot.

783
00:52:32,821 --> 00:52:36,262
Actually, the dimension plane was modified during the season

784
00:52:36,302 --> 00:52:38,703
because sometimes I, oh, for instance,

785
00:52:38,863 --> 00:52:40,944
I wanted to start at the attic, and the exit

786
00:52:40,984 --> 00:52:42,085
were on the first floor.

787
00:52:42,605 --> 00:52:44,786
But I wanted to have some surprise,

788
00:52:44,846 --> 00:52:47,507
like the whole cave is under the house.

789
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,147
So actually, when you reach the first ground,

790
00:52:49,187 --> 00:52:50,228
it's not the end of the game.

791
00:52:50,248 --> 00:52:51,188
You have all the parts.

792
00:52:52,589 --> 00:52:56,031
under the house, and then you need to come back to,

793
00:52:56,331 --> 00:52:58,112
but it was done in those three days,

794
00:52:58,192 --> 00:53:01,054
and sometimes I, oh, yeah, but this door is not convenient.

795
00:53:01,434 --> 00:53:03,495
I prefer that we go here before,

796
00:53:03,575 --> 00:53:06,337
so let's move a little bit the walls in it,

797
00:53:06,417 --> 00:53:11,500
but nothing was really modified after those three days,

798
00:53:11,840 --> 00:53:14,062
except when really something was not working,

799
00:53:14,122 --> 00:53:15,162
but not the plane.

800
00:53:15,682 --> 00:53:17,764
The big stuff didn't change after that.

801
00:53:18,344 --> 00:53:20,385
We were lucky, I think, very lucky.

802
00:53:22,491 --> 00:53:28,255
Okay, uh, two questions. Uh, the first one is, uh, what do you think of all the survival horrors that

803
00:53:28,755 --> 00:53:35,380
came out after Alone in the Dark? Like, you know, uh, Resident Evil and Silent Hill. And the second

804
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,783
one is, I don't know who owns the rights for Alone in the Dark now, but has someone ever considered

805
00:53:40,863 --> 00:53:47,307
making an HD remake of this game for some platform? I would love an HD remake one day and I hope it

806
00:53:47,468 --> 00:53:47,628
will.

807
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:54,011
happen one day, but I think in four grains, all the right, I'm not sure about that, I

808
00:53:54,051 --> 00:53:54,391
don't know.

809
00:53:55,632 --> 00:54:01,693
And about the games, the evolution of the game, as I told you, I wanted an adventure

810
00:54:01,793 --> 00:54:02,013
game.

811
00:54:02,414 --> 00:54:07,195
Okay, with action, there's a lot of action, actually, in the game, but that was the spirit

812
00:54:07,255 --> 00:54:08,595
of the game was re-adventure.

813
00:54:09,116 --> 00:54:15,903
So, actually I wasn't very happy with what they did on the sequels of the game.

814
00:54:16,243 --> 00:54:22,069
Games in the same ambient spirit that I prefer, it's more silent here.

815
00:54:22,770 --> 00:54:30,198
Or recently, Alan Wake, which is closer to this kind of spirit I wanted for the game

816
00:54:30,238 --> 00:54:30,719
at this time.

817
00:54:31,399 --> 00:54:31,620
Thank you.

818
00:54:34,700 --> 00:54:38,904
Just one question for me, something I never really understood is why there is a...

819
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:45,751
At the beginning of the game you have the choice to choose between a male character, female character, with different storyline.

820
00:54:46,611 --> 00:54:50,775
And did you really expect in 92, female playing this kind of game?

821
00:54:51,116 --> 00:54:55,921
Okay, I forgot to say it actually. Merci Alexi. Alexi was one of the testers of the first Alone in the Dark.

822
00:54:55,961 --> 00:54:56,141
Yeah.

823
00:54:58,749 --> 00:54:59,930
Yes, thank you, Alexei.

824
00:54:59,970 --> 00:55:01,951
I forgot to say it.

825
00:55:02,151 --> 00:55:04,413
I was very naive at this time.

826
00:55:04,493 --> 00:55:07,935
And I believe that if I put a female character in the game,

827
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:14,699
woman will want to play the game.

828
00:55:15,139 --> 00:55:16,500
I was very naive about that.

829
00:55:16,901 --> 00:55:20,663
And also something I forgot to say when you saw the animation

830
00:55:20,723 --> 00:55:25,346
with the girl, I thought that I can put the same animation for

831
00:55:25,366 --> 00:55:27,087
the male character than for the female.

832
00:55:27,927 --> 00:55:33,270
character, but it's not true. All the animations were redone. And something I also wanted at

833
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:37,953
the beginning is that the story for the things you have to do, not just the story, things

834
00:55:37,993 --> 00:55:43,576
you have to do for the female character, to have something different for her. But same

835
00:55:43,596 --> 00:55:49,319
thing, we didn't have time to do that. So the story is sadly exactly the same for both

836
00:55:49,399 --> 00:55:49,900
characters.

837
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:55,783
Hi. I must tell you first that I really admire this game.

838
00:55:56,250 --> 00:55:58,031
This really scared me when I was very young.

839
00:55:58,691 --> 00:56:01,533
And I didn't hear anything about the sound.

840
00:56:01,613 --> 00:56:04,775
And I remember being really afraid of the steps.

841
00:56:05,856 --> 00:56:08,278
So when did you put the sound in the game?

842
00:56:08,358 --> 00:56:10,179
At what moment did it come in the project?

843
00:56:10,619 --> 00:56:13,141
Was it really late in the project?

844
00:56:13,241 --> 00:56:15,543
Or you always planned that sound?

845
00:56:15,563 --> 00:56:18,224
I don't understand what you're saying.

846
00:56:18,325 --> 00:56:20,926
If you have a sound, you can explain that when you walk on the floor,

847
00:56:21,567 --> 00:56:24,769
if you put it very early in your track, it's very late.

848
00:56:25,804 --> 00:56:31,345
Actually, it was quite soon in the game, because all those

849
00:56:31,665 --> 00:56:36,086
information for Watson, because every step's sound is

850
00:56:36,126 --> 00:56:39,887
different, depending on the ground you are walking on.

851
00:56:40,287 --> 00:56:43,708
So it was integrated quite soon in SenEdit tool, because

852
00:56:43,748 --> 00:56:47,248
when you put those wireframes collision in the game, you

853
00:56:47,268 --> 00:56:49,789
said, OK, the sound, if you work on this collision, is

854
00:56:50,789 --> 00:56:51,430
is this one.

855
00:56:51,790 --> 00:56:56,554
So that was something integrated quite soon in the game.

856
00:56:57,154 --> 00:57:01,198
Not really at the beginning, because the sound artist

857
00:57:01,778 --> 00:57:03,540
wasn't here at the real beginning.

858
00:57:03,580 --> 00:57:05,501
But it was very, very soon, because.

859
00:57:07,422 --> 00:57:12,903
Since this three days meeting, all the sounds were listed during those three days too.

860
00:57:12,943 --> 00:57:17,144
So after that he had the list of everything to put in the game.

861
00:57:17,204 --> 00:57:24,306
So it was done, yeah, let's say in the first quarter of the development.

862
00:57:24,326 --> 00:57:24,866
Okay.

863
00:57:25,146 --> 00:57:25,446
Thanks.

864
00:57:25,947 --> 00:57:26,227
Thank you.

865
00:57:26,247 --> 00:57:26,327
Okay.

866
00:57:29,668 --> 00:57:30,808
Thank you, everybody.

867
00:57:31,088 --> 00:57:32,008
Thank you very much for coming.

868
00:57:32,028 --> 00:57:32,248
Thank you.

869
00:57:32,268 --> 00:57:32,488
Thank you.

870
00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:32,688
Thank you.

871
00:57:32,708 --> 00:57:32,928
Thank you.

872
00:57:32,948 --> 00:57:33,168
Thank you.
