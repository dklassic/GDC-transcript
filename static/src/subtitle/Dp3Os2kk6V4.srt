1
00:00:06,643 --> 00:00:07,164
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:07,184 --> 00:00:07,644
Good morning.

3
00:00:07,964 --> 00:00:09,064
Welcome to the GDC.

4
00:00:09,244 --> 00:00:12,825
This is a lecture about digital pixelization

5
00:00:12,885 --> 00:00:14,026
in the 22nd century.

6
00:00:14,046 --> 00:00:18,167
And actually, I just want to let you

7
00:00:18,187 --> 00:00:19,687
know that you are in the right room.

8
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:22,008
This is the NBA Jam post-mortem.

9
00:00:22,508 --> 00:00:24,749
And I'll be heading the surgery.

10
00:00:26,109 --> 00:00:30,951
No radio playing, gambling, spinning during the procedures.

11
00:00:31,351 --> 00:00:32,872
And if you'd like to turn off your cell phones.

12
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:38,634
Imagine, if you will, 2001 Space Odyssey music playing behind.

13
00:00:39,354 --> 00:00:40,375
That's what I had in my mind.

14
00:00:41,396 --> 00:00:50,203
Let's go back to a simpler time, the 90s, a decade defined by profound change,

15
00:00:50,984 --> 00:00:55,308
world changing events, the dissolution of the Soviet Union.

16
00:00:56,489 --> 00:01:00,572
Yes. The cloning of the first mammal.

17
00:01:02,241 --> 00:01:03,162
Baaaaaa!

18
00:01:04,663 --> 00:01:06,044
It was a big moment, I remember that.

19
00:01:07,865 --> 00:01:11,388
But, meanwhile, the Hubble telescope goes into orbit.

20
00:01:13,109 --> 00:01:14,090
The Gulf War.

21
00:01:15,991 --> 00:01:20,274
But meanwhile, in Chicago, at Midway Games,

22
00:01:21,275 --> 00:01:23,076
a new era was being ushered in.

23
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:28,260
A renaissance in the gaming industry would explode onto the scene,

24
00:01:29,641 --> 00:01:31,702
shattering records and coin up earnings.

25
00:01:32,886 --> 00:01:44,472
and sales. The game was a turning point. It was revolutionary. It was Mortal Kombat. Wait, what?

26
00:01:46,633 --> 00:01:49,414
Hold on. I know what you're thinking. I kind of thought the same thing, too.

27
00:01:50,135 --> 00:01:57,278
But then, like, shortly after that, maybe two months tops at best, the real game changer.

28
00:01:57,799 --> 00:02:00,960
Where are you at, Boone? Yeah, the real game changer came along.

29
00:02:02,255 --> 00:02:05,936
Welcome to NBA Jam, Boomshakalaka!

30
00:02:07,757 --> 00:02:11,999
The game changer the world was waiting for had come at last.

31
00:02:12,439 --> 00:02:14,280
The savior of the coin-op business.

32
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:18,161
And maybe the killer of the pinball game, but that's another story.

33
00:02:19,342 --> 00:02:23,163
NBA Jam would go on to become the highest earning coin-op game of all time.

34
00:02:23,183 --> 00:02:25,044
That's pretty amazing.

35
00:02:26,005 --> 00:02:29,566
And I was one of the highest paid performers at that time, $600 I believe.

36
00:02:31,703 --> 00:02:32,844
for a game that would earn a lot of money.

37
00:02:32,864 --> 00:02:34,806
Yeah, it was a new era,

38
00:02:35,006 --> 00:02:37,188
and that's why we're all here in the room right now.

39
00:02:37,568 --> 00:02:39,370
It was 25 years ago today

40
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:43,914
that Mark J. Turmell gave fan gamers a new game to play.

41
00:02:44,515 --> 00:02:46,697
And all you gamer geeks that know codes,

42
00:02:47,417 --> 00:02:51,781
MJT0322 is his birthday.

43
00:02:52,462 --> 00:02:54,084
The man with the biggest head on the planet,

44
00:02:54,104 --> 00:02:55,125
cause he invented the big heads.

45
00:02:56,063 --> 00:03:00,985
It's 6'6", hailing from Michigan, one of the original Detroit bad boys,

46
00:03:01,545 --> 00:03:08,709
the man in the middle of the gaming industry, Mr. Zeus himself, MJT. It's his birthday.

47
00:03:08,749 --> 00:03:18,813
Give him a big round of applause. The 6'6'' legend. High five. All right. It's his birthday.

48
00:03:19,113 --> 00:03:23,195
How fitting is that? And now, co-creator.

49
00:03:23,974 --> 00:03:34,140
at six foot four. He was the guy well you know maybe 5'10, 5'11. He wore shoes six feet we'll

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,024
call six feet Sal DeVita. You may remember him he was also one of the actors in Mortal Kombat.

51
00:03:40,504 --> 00:03:45,027
There's all the great visuals the genius Sal DeVita. Mark Sabell we're glad you guys got up

52
00:03:45,107 --> 00:03:48,429
early. I know there's been a lot of partying. Thanks for being here we're gonna have some fun

53
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:49,229
and let's

54
00:03:49,887 --> 00:03:51,208
Get the surgery in the postmortem.

55
00:03:51,548 --> 00:03:52,389
Let's start here.

56
00:03:52,449 --> 00:03:52,949
Thanks, guys.

57
00:03:53,529 --> 00:03:57,731
All right.

58
00:03:59,752 --> 00:04:01,193
Thank you, Tim Kitsrow.

59
00:04:02,393 --> 00:04:04,714
Tim is a rare talent.

60
00:04:05,735 --> 00:04:11,538
Tim, Sal, and I not only did NBA Jam, but then we went on to do NFL Blitz.

61
00:04:11,898 --> 00:04:15,940
And Tim was amazing on both products.

62
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,181
It was totally unnecessary, Mark, but a whole lot of fun to hear.

63
00:04:20,047 --> 00:04:23,841
and so it's been great working with these guys over the years.

64
00:04:25,873 --> 00:04:32,117
It's an honor to be here today talking to my brethren in the games business.

65
00:04:32,878 --> 00:04:38,622
A lot of you are probably too young to even remember NBA Jam or to have played it, but

66
00:04:39,482 --> 00:04:43,005
many probably did immerse themselves in it a time or two.

67
00:04:44,125 --> 00:04:49,529
It's an honor to be representing the team, not just these guys, but the team that put

68
00:04:49,549 --> 00:04:50,229
the game together.

69
00:04:51,671 --> 00:04:56,314
It was really kind of a magical time back at Midway there in the 90s.

70
00:04:57,755 --> 00:05:02,519
So, let's flash back to 1993.

71
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:06,322
Because again, some of you probably don't remember this,

72
00:05:07,003 --> 00:05:09,365
but 25 years ago, the game was introduced.

73
00:05:10,726 --> 00:05:13,088
We did it at an NBA All-Star game.

74
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:14,069
It was in Utah.

75
00:05:14,629 --> 00:05:17,492
A lot of the players came over, you know, they shuffled over,

76
00:05:17,552 --> 00:05:18,573
took a look at this game.

77
00:05:19,513 --> 00:05:21,995
They all got a copy of the coin-op game,

78
00:05:25,398 --> 00:05:26,159
$3,500, $3,900 piece of equipment.

79
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:27,140
But they were mad.

80
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,121
Every single one of them I talked to

81
00:05:29,542 --> 00:05:31,644
was mad because either they weren't in the game,

82
00:05:31,744 --> 00:05:33,565
because I had selected the wrong players,

83
00:05:34,246 --> 00:05:36,027
or they didn't like their stats.

84
00:05:37,068 --> 00:05:38,930
So it started right then and there.

85
00:05:38,950 --> 00:05:41,011
You know, you hear that over the years

86
00:05:41,031 --> 00:05:42,933
where these athletes are unhappy with their stats.

87
00:05:43,605 --> 00:05:47,607
But 1993, and this slide right here,

88
00:05:49,347 --> 00:05:53,329
the upper right corner really tells the whole story here. $2,468.

89
00:05:53,749 --> 00:05:59,311
That's one week of earnings at one of our locations.

90
00:06:00,331 --> 00:06:03,452
Every arcade around the country, of course what they do

91
00:06:03,532 --> 00:06:06,673
is they track their revenue on a per game basis.

92
00:06:06,973 --> 00:06:08,934
They're trying to shuffle in new games,

93
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:10,835
get rid of the games that aren't making money.

94
00:06:10,975 --> 00:06:12,215
Hey Mark, give them a frame of reference.

95
00:06:12,275 --> 00:06:13,716
Like what did the average game make?

96
00:06:14,016 --> 00:06:14,936
It's there on the screen.

97
00:06:15,496 --> 00:06:19,077
So the number two game is, you know, virtual racing.

98
00:06:19,897 --> 00:06:21,938
But so $2,468 was just such a stunning number

99
00:06:21,958 --> 00:06:22,778
because as a $3,500 or $3,900 price point

100
00:06:22,798 --> 00:06:25,259
for these coin-op machines, well, the operator,

101
00:06:25,279 --> 00:06:26,639
the owner of that device,

102
00:06:35,942 --> 00:06:39,407
can pay it off in a couple of weeks and then it's pure gravy from from there

103
00:06:39,447 --> 00:06:39,807
forward.

104
00:06:40,428 --> 00:06:44,133
What it all added up to with the number of coin op units we sent out there

105
00:06:44,693 --> 00:06:48,018
and that the actually averaging around seven hundred dollars

106
00:06:48,378 --> 00:06:52,083
it comes out to a billion dollars in that first twelve months.

107
00:06:52,823 --> 00:06:54,384
That's four billion quarters.

108
00:06:54,824 --> 00:06:55,664
I mean, it's crazy.

109
00:06:56,004 --> 00:06:59,425
We talk nowadays about microtransactions

110
00:06:59,525 --> 00:07:02,606
and these games are crushing it here and there,

111
00:07:02,666 --> 00:07:04,786
the Candy Crushes, the Clash of Clans.

112
00:07:05,286 --> 00:07:08,307
Well, here's a game that really kind of set the tone

113
00:07:08,347 --> 00:07:10,387
for microtransactions when you think back on it.

114
00:07:11,488 --> 00:07:15,509
At the same time, Jurassic Park was the breakout film,

115
00:07:15,849 --> 00:07:17,829
became the number one film of all time

116
00:07:18,549 --> 00:07:21,190
at about $350 million grossing.

117
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:22,410
That was unheard of at the time.

118
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:25,191
And so it really kind of puts it in perspective.

119
00:07:25,992 --> 00:07:27,672
The game just really blew up.

120
00:07:30,333 --> 00:07:32,674
Of course, then there was a lot of anticipation.

121
00:07:32,734 --> 00:07:33,475
I'm a little off today.

122
00:07:34,155 --> 00:07:35,215
A little late.

123
00:07:35,255 --> 00:07:36,156
It blew up.

124
00:07:37,996 --> 00:07:42,780
That created a lot of anticipation for the home versions.

125
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,742
And so we were on the cover of these magazines.

126
00:07:45,782 --> 00:07:48,964
You can see here, Ed Boon, I don't know if you noticed

127
00:07:48,984 --> 00:07:50,705
that first line that says,

128
00:07:50,865 --> 00:07:51,846
better than Mortal Kombat?

129
00:07:52,206 --> 00:07:53,447
Question mark?

130
00:07:53,467 --> 00:07:54,307
Leave it alone.

131
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:57,950
But, yeah, but no, we were really excited

132
00:07:58,350 --> 00:08:01,732
just to see the kind of the anticipation and the coverage,

133
00:08:04,194 --> 00:08:06,816
gaming guides and so forth.

134
00:08:08,337 --> 00:08:10,899
And indeed, we actually delivered.

135
00:08:11,459 --> 00:08:13,181
The home version came out.

136
00:08:13,241 --> 00:08:16,985
It was a faithful conversion of the coin-operated game.

137
00:08:17,745 --> 00:08:22,230
And we sold millions of cartridges that year of NBA Jam.

138
00:08:23,791 --> 00:08:24,912
It was a Bitcoin of its day.

139
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:26,614
Yeah.

140
00:08:26,634 --> 00:08:27,334
People couldn't believe it.

141
00:08:28,235 --> 00:08:30,257
Yeah, it was a crazy time.

142
00:08:32,001 --> 00:08:34,023
But so that's stepping back to 93.

143
00:08:34,623 --> 00:08:36,084
What we're really here to try to cover

144
00:08:36,225 --> 00:08:42,169
are some of the stories, some of how it actually came to exist,

145
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:44,631
and some of the problems and challenges and kind

146
00:08:44,772 --> 00:08:46,073
of goofy things that happened.

147
00:08:46,593 --> 00:08:48,355
So that's what we're going to do today, is kind of talk

148
00:08:48,395 --> 00:08:49,516
through some of those stories.

149
00:08:50,216 --> 00:08:51,797
And then we're going to have a little Q&A

150
00:08:52,478 --> 00:08:54,920
if anybody has questions toward the end.

151
00:08:55,641 --> 00:08:58,845
Both Tim and Sal will interject as we go forward here.

152
00:08:58,905 --> 00:09:03,350
But it's not going to be like behind the music VH1 where everybody had drug problems and rehabs.

153
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:06,454
It's a really happy story. It's post-mortem, but it's a happy story.

154
00:09:06,514 --> 00:09:07,134
I have that slide.

155
00:09:07,174 --> 00:09:08,156
You have a problem?

156
00:09:08,196 --> 00:09:09,077
I do. I have that slide.

157
00:09:09,357 --> 00:09:10,118
Oh, you have the slide.

158
00:09:10,238 --> 00:09:11,059
We were mostly done.

159
00:09:11,500 --> 00:09:11,700
No.

160
00:09:12,865 --> 00:09:16,366
But I do have to acknowledge the team right off the bat.

161
00:09:16,586 --> 00:09:17,547
Again, we're up here.

162
00:09:18,187 --> 00:09:20,068
I'm honored to represent.

163
00:09:20,128 --> 00:09:24,249
But here on the lower left-hand picture, Tony Goski.

164
00:09:24,910 --> 00:09:28,051
He's still killing it, I'm sure, on the Mortal Kombat

165
00:09:28,151 --> 00:09:29,391
franchise there in Chicago.

166
00:09:30,112 --> 00:09:32,553
John Carlton is the lower left, an artist.

167
00:09:33,433 --> 00:09:34,113
I'm up top.

168
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,194
Sal's there in the middle.

169
00:09:35,774 --> 00:09:36,574
Jamie Rivett.

170
00:09:37,455 --> 00:09:40,157
kind of brooding in the back there with the black hair.

171
00:09:40,537 --> 00:09:45,681
I still have the honor of working with him on a daily basis at Zynga today.

172
00:09:45,701 --> 00:09:51,606
He did the Smash TV conversions for the consumer side.

173
00:09:52,126 --> 00:09:53,667
Smash TV was my first coin-op game.

174
00:09:54,568 --> 00:09:57,130
So he's been killing it for decades.

175
00:09:57,990 --> 00:10:01,213
John Hay in the lower right-hand corner is the audio guy,

176
00:10:01,633 --> 00:10:02,994
we always used to say, the sound guy.

177
00:10:04,255 --> 00:10:07,076
wrote a lot of the music and was in the studio with Tim

178
00:10:08,056 --> 00:10:09,317
to come up with all those phrases.

179
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:12,778
And then in the, yep.

180
00:10:13,378 --> 00:10:16,579
And upper right, John Newcomer standing there.

181
00:10:16,619 --> 00:10:17,840
He's still in the business today.

182
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:20,381
And then I put Sean Liptack here

183
00:10:20,401 --> 00:10:22,461
because he wasn't in any of the other photos.

184
00:10:23,722 --> 00:10:26,003
He was kind of our brainiac engineer,

185
00:10:26,603 --> 00:10:27,823
did a lot of really cool things.

186
00:10:27,883 --> 00:10:29,424
So wanted to acknowledge the team.

187
00:10:29,444 --> 00:10:32,505
And of course, Tim Kitsiro right there in the studio.

188
00:10:32,545 --> 00:10:33,145
He's on fire.

189
00:10:34,425 --> 00:10:39,631
And at lower right, the hairdos of the time, we didn't talk about that, the Robert Plant

190
00:10:39,751 --> 00:10:41,093
and the Bono?

191
00:10:41,153 --> 00:10:41,553
Bono?

192
00:10:42,114 --> 00:10:42,594
Wrestling?

193
00:10:42,634 --> 00:10:43,055
Wrestling.

194
00:10:43,235 --> 00:10:43,936
Who wore it best?

195
00:10:43,996 --> 00:10:44,617
You decide.

196
00:10:44,717 --> 00:10:45,418
Right, right.

197
00:10:46,038 --> 00:10:48,721
Yeah, some good hair back in those days.

198
00:10:50,223 --> 00:10:50,924
How it began.

199
00:10:52,108 --> 00:10:56,033
So it's really, when you think about Midway in that era,

200
00:10:56,194 --> 00:10:57,255
you're familiar with NARC.

201
00:10:58,316 --> 00:11:00,239
That was this new hardware platform

202
00:11:00,259 --> 00:11:03,844
that Eugene Jarvis had developed there in Chicago.

203
00:11:04,265 --> 00:11:07,669
They crafted a game that had some digitized imagery in it.

204
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,010
There was a.

205
00:11:08,570 --> 00:11:12,773
a red Porsche and you know there were characters walking around, you were trying to take out

206
00:11:12,834 --> 00:11:13,494
drug dealers.

207
00:11:14,535 --> 00:11:16,336
It was really the first violent game even.

208
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:20,159
There were a lot of body parts, you know, you'd blow people up with, you know, bazookas.

209
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:24,942
But the rest of the industry too was starting to dabble in

210
00:11:26,784 --> 00:11:32,245
digitizing, of taking, you know, there was claymation on this Primal Rage game.

211
00:11:32,265 --> 00:11:39,448
You know, people were starting to try to get these images off of VHS tapes or Hi8 tapes

212
00:11:39,868 --> 00:11:44,529
and put them onto the screen. And so we were all internally kind of, you know, geeking out on that.

213
00:11:45,450 --> 00:11:51,592
My art partner on Smash TV and Total Carnage was John Tobias, an amazing artist.

214
00:11:51,632 --> 00:11:55,313
I have the honor to work with him actually now on a daily basis as well at Zynga.

215
00:11:55,773 --> 00:11:55,913
But...

216
00:11:56,654 --> 00:11:59,780
He was incredible at drawing and painting,

217
00:12:00,581 --> 00:12:02,846
but he wanted to do digitized graphics.

218
00:12:03,167 --> 00:12:04,970
He branched off and joined up with Ed

219
00:12:05,371 --> 00:12:06,673
to create Mortal Kombat.

220
00:12:07,305 --> 00:12:11,487
And then I branched off to dabble in digitized graphics

221
00:12:11,527 --> 00:12:12,467
to do NBA Jam.

222
00:12:13,327 --> 00:12:16,028
Didn't start out, though, as an NBA licensed product.

223
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:20,210
We knew we wanted to get characters.

224
00:12:20,290 --> 00:12:23,031
Basketball, I'm a big fan.

225
00:12:23,412 --> 00:12:25,152
It was something that could leverage that tech.

226
00:12:25,492 --> 00:12:27,693
I went out onto the streets to try to find

227
00:12:28,093 --> 00:12:29,534
some talent to shoot.

228
00:12:29,934 --> 00:12:32,115
So I was cruising around YMCA's and.

229
00:12:32,635 --> 00:12:35,478
you know, in kind of the inner parts of the city,

230
00:12:35,538 --> 00:12:36,719
trying to look for some talent.

231
00:12:37,179 --> 00:12:38,961
Found some guys, you know, paid them some money

232
00:12:38,981 --> 00:12:40,322
to come into a studio and said,

233
00:12:40,342 --> 00:12:42,284
hey, we want to shoot you to do this.

234
00:12:42,324 --> 00:12:43,645
We'll pay you this hourly rate.

235
00:12:44,346 --> 00:12:45,847
So we got some talent to come in,

236
00:12:45,867 --> 00:12:49,830
and you can see actually a little couple of snippets here

237
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:50,071
of the,

238
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:56,314
of those early sessions, we had the camera rolling on a track and the characters.

239
00:12:56,714 --> 00:12:58,455
We painted the wall blue.

240
00:12:58,515 --> 00:13:00,456
We put blue uniforms on the players.

241
00:13:00,776 --> 00:13:04,438
We saw this on TV, on the weather report.

242
00:13:05,118 --> 00:13:11,181
I'll let Sal talk about that later to explain the strategy behind blue on blue.

243
00:13:11,501 --> 00:13:12,121
Really smart.

244
00:13:12,582 --> 00:13:12,782
Yeah.

245
00:13:13,882 --> 00:13:14,883
Yeah, we'll get to that.

246
00:13:14,903 --> 00:13:15,663
Don't get me started.

247
00:13:15,843 --> 00:13:16,203
Blue demons.

248
00:13:16,223 --> 00:13:16,303
Yeah.

249
00:13:16,323 --> 00:13:16,403
Yeah.

250
00:13:16,423 --> 00:13:16,503
Yeah.

251
00:13:16,523 --> 00:13:16,603
Yeah.

252
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,802
So about halfway through the project,

253
00:13:22,003 --> 00:13:24,345
the president of the company, Neil Nicastro, he came in

254
00:13:25,006 --> 00:13:27,388
and he said, why not try to get an NBA license?

255
00:13:27,789 --> 00:13:29,210
It didn't really even occur to me

256
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:31,852
that that would be in the realm of possibility.

257
00:13:31,872 --> 00:13:33,133
That had never happened before.

258
00:13:34,635 --> 00:13:37,377
We're just a small coin-op company, it felt like.

259
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:39,519
But we put together a video.

260
00:13:39,539 --> 00:13:42,742
This is a short little piece of the video

261
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,263
that we sent off to the NBA.

262
00:13:45,971 --> 00:13:47,611
Yeah, the real video is like 10 minutes long, or 5 minutes long.

263
00:13:47,631 --> 00:13:52,613
Williams Electronics is currently developing an arcade-based, 4-player video basketball game.

264
00:13:53,293 --> 00:13:55,654
One which employs lifelike digitized graphics.

265
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:04,296
If granted an NBA license, we would elevate this game beyond any computer sports simulation ever done.

266
00:14:05,537 --> 00:14:11,738
Allowing players to choose their favorite team, and see and hear the names of recognizable players would be fantastic.

267
00:14:13,187 --> 00:14:18,309
The 6 foot high NBA logo on the side of the cabinet would undoubtedly attract much attention

268
00:14:18,669 --> 00:14:20,510
and generate even more excitement.

269
00:14:21,531 --> 00:14:25,272
Thank you for viewing this work in progress and for considering our request.

270
00:14:30,765 --> 00:14:32,526
So it was a little bit longer, this video.

271
00:14:32,586 --> 00:14:35,489
We sent that off and we kind of waited anxiously

272
00:14:35,509 --> 00:14:37,071
to hear how they'd respond.

273
00:14:37,491 --> 00:14:41,395
I didn't expect them to accept it.

274
00:14:42,035 --> 00:14:44,778
And sure enough, we got a phone call back

275
00:14:44,838 --> 00:14:46,199
that they had rejected.

276
00:14:46,439 --> 00:14:46,780
Rejected!

277
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:47,140
Rejected.

278
00:14:49,442 --> 00:14:50,543
And so we.

279
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,085
Get that stuff out of here.

280
00:14:52,125 --> 00:14:52,665
I can't go all day.

281
00:14:55,586 --> 00:14:58,707
But I was surprised at the reason they rejected us.

282
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:03,669
They basically said, we don't want our NBA logo

283
00:15:04,169 --> 00:15:07,270
in these seedy arcade locations.

284
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:11,131
And we were like, you know, well, yeah, I've seen a few seedy arcades,

285
00:15:11,171 --> 00:15:14,532
but that's not the normal arcade experience.

286
00:15:14,992 --> 00:15:18,733
But their reference point was Times Square in New York City.

287
00:15:19,473 --> 00:15:24,136
Because that's where their offices were and at that time there in the 80s Times Square was very

288
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:26,757
You know grungy a lot of you know

289
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:32,040
Prostitution a lot of drugs and a lot of that was happening at these 24-hour and if you're a corporate NBA guy

290
00:15:32,060 --> 00:15:34,822
Where are you hanging out?

291
00:15:35,663 --> 00:15:38,724
Right and so they didn't want order in there

292
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:43,451
But so they said, hey, you know, we don't want our NBA logo.

293
00:15:43,471 --> 00:15:44,851
I don't want my wife to know where I'm going.

294
00:15:45,272 --> 00:15:46,032
Six feet tall.

295
00:15:46,272 --> 00:15:46,912
Or our fans.

296
00:15:47,272 --> 00:15:47,452
Yep.

297
00:15:47,972 --> 00:15:50,373
Plastered there in those locations.

298
00:15:50,633 --> 00:15:54,755
And so we were taken aback, but we said, oh, we can solve this.

299
00:15:54,915 --> 00:15:57,076
And so we went and we created a new video

300
00:15:57,576 --> 00:16:00,817
that went to bowling alleys and family entertainment centers.

301
00:16:01,097 --> 00:16:02,137
And Mormon churches.

302
00:16:02,557 --> 00:16:06,359
Yeah, we have more of the normal location

303
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:08,119
for coin-operated games.

304
00:16:08,379 --> 00:16:08,900
And it worked.

305
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:16,823
They got that, they said, okay, we understand, and they worked out a deal that was very reasonable.

306
00:16:16,883 --> 00:16:19,124
I think we were only paying them about $100, $150 a game on that $3,500 price point.

307
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,885
So it was a pretty good deal to get that NBA license.

308
00:16:30,913 --> 00:16:33,374
That brought up of course then the problem.

309
00:16:34,255 --> 00:16:35,595
We're halfway through development.

310
00:16:36,296 --> 00:16:38,056
You saw kind of the state of the game,

311
00:16:38,076 --> 00:16:39,277
you know, players running around,

312
00:16:39,297 --> 00:16:40,977
you know, it shot a lot of footage.

313
00:16:42,338 --> 00:16:45,779
But it brought up all these issues of, okay, players,

314
00:16:46,420 --> 00:16:48,901
and how do we leverage all that?

315
00:16:48,941 --> 00:16:50,161
How do we get this content?

316
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,822
This, you know, small, too small to read,

317
00:16:52,862 --> 00:16:54,803
but I'm highlighting here a couple of things.

318
00:16:55,423 --> 00:16:57,364
One, we were asking for source material,

319
00:16:57,444 --> 00:17:00,265
like, you know, can you take photos of the players?

320
00:17:00,826 --> 00:17:02,919
Back in those days, there were no...

321
00:17:04,529 --> 00:17:08,390
NBA photos they took in preseason camp.

322
00:17:09,891 --> 00:17:12,072
We referenced down here at the bottom, it says,

323
00:17:12,092 --> 00:17:15,474
what do you think about the name NBA Jam or NBA Showtime?

324
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,054
We eventually used both names, of course.

325
00:17:18,595 --> 00:17:22,977
So it's the opening letter there in August of 92

326
00:17:24,698 --> 00:17:28,579
with kind of what our requests were, including the players.

327
00:17:29,320 --> 00:17:31,261
And the players, again, there was no internet.

328
00:17:32,482 --> 00:17:36,148
There was no DirecTV NBA League Pass package.

329
00:17:36,929 --> 00:17:39,893
It was just me and John Hay, the sound guy,

330
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:44,220
kind of looking at, we were fans, but we had to look at the...

331
00:17:45,056 --> 00:17:48,641
you know the newspaper and you know try to figure out your favorites yeah picking

332
00:17:48,681 --> 00:17:52,467
our favorites you know who would look good out there on the screen you know

333
00:17:52,908 --> 00:17:56,252
we're uh... we're making those choices i've got a lot of heat over the years

334
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,876
with some of the selections uh... some of the players

335
00:17:58,896 --> 00:18:01,720
you know weren't worthy of being in the the final two

336
00:18:02,361 --> 00:18:04,743
But, yeah, it's part of the lore.

337
00:18:04,763 --> 00:18:07,284
And you would have cut Chicago out altogether if you could have done that, right?

338
00:18:07,304 --> 00:18:08,105
Yeah, well, that's true.

339
00:18:08,225 --> 00:18:09,666
Yeah, no Chicago.

340
00:18:09,866 --> 00:18:15,029
I don't even reference that in the deck here, but some of you who are, you know...

341
00:18:16,022 --> 00:18:21,307
aficionados of these secret codes. I did have cheat codes in against the Bulls

342
00:18:22,108 --> 00:18:26,892
when they played the Pistons because I was a big Pistons fan so it was my only

343
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:29,795
way with Jordan rising it was my only way to kind of level the playing field.

344
00:18:29,815 --> 00:18:32,638
He was working with Chuck Daly in the Jordan rules. So underhanded. Right, right.

345
00:18:34,439 --> 00:18:39,562
But so that that brought us to okay now we need these players. We've got to have a broadcast look

346
00:18:39,823 --> 00:18:42,964
We need a broadcast announcer. We need to be you know up our game

347
00:18:44,025 --> 00:18:45,126
and so that

348
00:18:45,466 --> 00:18:49,268
That was the next problem, and that's where we really

349
00:18:50,069 --> 00:18:54,914
you know, got Sal involved to try to solve that problem.

350
00:18:55,475 --> 00:18:58,959
And so I'll let you, you know, talk about a couple of these

351
00:18:59,419 --> 00:19:00,260
things on the tech side.

352
00:19:00,761 --> 00:19:03,844
Sure, yeah, actually, so getting all the,

353
00:19:03,884 --> 00:19:04,705
the challenge of getting all the.

354
00:19:05,545 --> 00:19:09,986
the players in the game and making it look broadcast and whatever, that was huge.

355
00:19:10,106 --> 00:19:14,687
Our team, two guys, three guys, Tony as well, we were like scratching our heads.

356
00:19:14,727 --> 00:19:16,947
How do we get all the players in the game?

357
00:19:17,288 --> 00:19:18,788
And how do we make it look like TV?

358
00:19:19,188 --> 00:19:21,808
Well, luckily, we had an advantage with our hardware.

359
00:19:21,968 --> 00:19:23,349
Our hardware was amazing.

360
00:19:23,709 --> 00:19:24,989
It gave us the ability to...

361
00:19:25,629 --> 00:19:31,850
Most hardware for video games at the time had like 16 colors of just a few palettes

362
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:35,031
they could put on the screen at any one time or 32 or something like that.

363
00:19:35,651 --> 00:19:41,573
but we had the ability to put 256 palettes of 256 colors,

364
00:19:42,054 --> 00:19:44,094
which if we were creative enough could make,

365
00:19:44,274 --> 00:19:45,595
you know, pretty much make it look like

366
00:19:45,695 --> 00:19:47,176
unlimited colors on the screen.

367
00:19:47,616 --> 00:19:49,737
So it gave us the ability to get all these beautiful,

368
00:19:49,817 --> 00:19:52,538
like flesh tones and all these beautiful highlights

369
00:19:52,978 --> 00:19:55,439
and so, and also when the videos were shot,

370
00:19:55,859 --> 00:19:58,380
you know, all the details in the skin came out

371
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,361
to an extent, except for, you know, how it was shot.

372
00:20:02,381 --> 00:20:02,461
So.

373
00:20:03,416 --> 00:20:10,197
So, to get the characters in the game, we thought we had an advantage by shooting them

374
00:20:10,337 --> 00:20:15,839
against the blue screen, the digitized footage, because it would automatically cut them out

375
00:20:15,919 --> 00:20:21,180
from the background, and then we'd have footage to, we'd have those frames to choose to put

376
00:20:21,200 --> 00:20:21,640
them in the game.

377
00:20:21,660 --> 00:20:24,780
And actually, there's a little video here that shows the process of that.

378
00:20:24,881 --> 00:20:25,841
And here, I'll just go through that real quick.

379
00:20:25,881 --> 00:20:29,602
Everyone who has seen this work in progress agrees we have a hit on our hands.

380
00:20:31,015 --> 00:20:34,017
First, basketball players are videotaped in a studio

381
00:20:34,378 --> 00:20:35,699
performing hundreds of moves.

382
00:20:40,422 --> 00:20:42,684
Then artists digitize this footage

383
00:20:42,764 --> 00:20:46,066
into individual frames, which are stored and played back

384
00:20:46,126 --> 00:20:49,829
in sequence or animated to create a video basketball

385
00:20:49,869 --> 00:20:52,471
player capable of performing on command.

386
00:20:54,072 --> 00:20:56,313
Artists are also creating every other element

387
00:20:56,353 --> 00:20:58,935
of the basketball experience, including the court.

388
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:03,229
That's enough of that. So that's all you need to know about that. So it looks really clean. It's

389
00:21:03,249 --> 00:21:07,130
like, oh cool, all the characters just pulled right out of the background. But unfortunately,

390
00:21:07,150 --> 00:21:13,711
like Mark mentioned, we had shot the characters against a blue screen that wasn't really lit

391
00:21:14,191 --> 00:21:18,072
well, like where it could be easily chroma keyed away. So that was our first challenge.

392
00:21:18,092 --> 00:21:22,874
The second challenge was we shot it on videotape, which meant the quality was pretty blurry and all

393
00:21:22,914 --> 00:21:26,575
the edges of the characters just bled into the background.

394
00:21:27,135 --> 00:21:34,723
So we had to go in and then also we shot with blue jerseys, uniforms, which against a blue screen.

395
00:21:35,203 --> 00:21:37,326
So the chroma key didn't quite work for that either.

396
00:21:37,786 --> 00:21:44,733
So we had to hand cut out every frame of animation on every character for every single animation.

397
00:21:44,993 --> 00:21:47,156
We'd go through and pixel by pixel.

398
00:21:48,170 --> 00:21:54,213
And so part of our hardware tools were a suite of custom tools that allowed us to step frame

399
00:21:54,233 --> 00:22:00,476
by frame, pixel by pixel, put on our headphones, you know, zone out, and for months just cut

400
00:22:00,516 --> 00:22:01,777
out every frame of animation.

401
00:22:02,317 --> 00:22:07,280
And that, and then we had to go through and tint all the edges because all the blue screen

402
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,821
in the background just bled right into them, right across.

403
00:22:10,161 --> 00:22:16,225
So it would pretty much shape out every character of every, on every, every different character.

404
00:22:16,245 --> 00:22:17,405
And then we had different.

405
00:22:17,885 --> 00:22:18,846
skin tone characters.

406
00:22:19,686 --> 00:22:22,428
So we had to unify all their skin tones

407
00:22:22,448 --> 00:22:25,549
so that we could use every animation for every character.

408
00:22:25,589 --> 00:22:27,330
So we had to tint all the skin all together

409
00:22:27,370 --> 00:22:29,211
to like a medium tone, so it could be easily

410
00:22:29,691 --> 00:22:32,812
with a palette, the index colors of palette that we had,

411
00:22:32,852 --> 00:22:35,293
which meant that we, I'm not gonna go into detail,

412
00:22:35,453 --> 00:22:40,256
but you could change that to be any shade that you want

413
00:22:41,096 --> 00:22:42,377
for skin, and then jersey,

414
00:22:42,397 --> 00:22:43,537
and we could change out the jersey colors.

415
00:22:44,017 --> 00:22:49,960
So by doing that, our hardware allowed us to have flexibility and freedom with that.

416
00:22:50,540 --> 00:22:55,922
But then the real challenge was the heads, the NBA characters themselves.

417
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:59,743
How were we going to get every NBA character in the game?

418
00:23:00,024 --> 00:23:05,186
We just shot the few guys that we shot and that was daunting to strip out and to get

419
00:23:05,206 --> 00:23:05,666
into the game.

420
00:23:06,366 --> 00:23:13,148
So we had to come up with a system for how we could actually get their faces in there and we came up with one based on

421
00:23:14,088 --> 00:23:16,929
Tech from previous games. It was like an object attach point

422
00:23:17,609 --> 00:23:22,131
Something you'd use for like, you know holding guns or weapons or picking something up and moving it around

423
00:23:22,511 --> 00:23:24,411
It's like a little we call them animation points

424
00:23:24,431 --> 00:23:29,193
But it's like a little point that you stick on every single frame you stick on to the part of the body that you want

425
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:33,814
The object to attach to and we said hey, why don't we use that for maybe putting heads on the guys?

426
00:23:33,914 --> 00:23:35,655
So we oops we lopped off

427
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:42,158
the heads of the animations and then we had to come up with a way of attaching the head that we wanted.

428
00:23:42,598 --> 00:23:47,940
But the characters are moving around, they're like all buzzing around, so we had to assign

429
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:54,183
a head angle, and you can see it there, for every frame of animation depending on which way the

430
00:23:54,243 --> 00:23:59,826
character was facing. So that was truly daunting. Luckily, you know, we had a talented group of guys

431
00:24:00,666 --> 00:24:03,868
that could extract the heads from

432
00:24:04,662 --> 00:24:06,843
things like magazines, slides, there was no internet.

433
00:24:07,064 --> 00:24:09,205
So we had to go to the store and like,

434
00:24:09,265 --> 00:24:10,906
okay, let's look through these, you know, these mags.

435
00:24:10,966 --> 00:24:12,907
Oh, cool, there's a head angle here that we could use for,

436
00:24:13,347 --> 00:24:15,388
you know, a large one or whatever.

437
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:19,990
Yeah, and so we'd watch the shows, the games,

438
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:21,211
and we'd record them on videotape.

439
00:24:21,231 --> 00:24:22,312
I'm like, oh, there's one right there.

440
00:24:22,352 --> 00:24:23,972
And so we'd take that tape and bring it to work,

441
00:24:23,992 --> 00:24:25,733
and then we'd, you know, scan it and whatever.

442
00:24:26,294 --> 00:24:27,776
So it was a nightmare to do.

443
00:24:27,796 --> 00:24:29,958
And then we had to hand touch stuff.

444
00:24:30,259 --> 00:24:32,782
And then we got savvy in the end where we noticed that,

445
00:24:32,862 --> 00:24:33,983
oh, you know what, from the back,

446
00:24:34,444 --> 00:24:36,326
you know, these guys kind of look the same

447
00:24:36,366 --> 00:24:37,347
and these guys kind of look the same

448
00:24:37,388 --> 00:24:39,931
and these guys totally cheated on a lot of that stuff.

449
00:24:40,011 --> 00:24:41,953
It might have been easier to just invent the internet.

450
00:24:43,694 --> 00:24:45,616
We should have totally done that, looking back now.

451
00:24:45,676 --> 00:24:50,079
Actually, Tony Goski, again, he's an amazing artist

452
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:53,341
on the Mortal Kombat team, and he started

453
00:24:53,361 --> 00:24:54,622
just hand-doing these things.

454
00:24:55,002 --> 00:24:57,664
He'd say, nah, you know what, let me just paint this guy.

455
00:24:57,684 --> 00:25:00,286
It was faster for him to create it than to digitize it.

456
00:25:00,306 --> 00:25:01,206
Yeah, he's a freak, though.

457
00:25:01,606 --> 00:25:06,450
So we had, our tools allowed us a lot of flexibility

458
00:25:06,470 --> 00:25:07,210
and help on that.

459
00:25:07,330 --> 00:25:09,071
So, all right, back to you, Mark.

460
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:10,392
Great, thanks.

461
00:25:10,432 --> 00:25:12,255
And when you say a guy's a freak, he's a freak.

462
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:14,118
When you guys, I mean, you guys do.

463
00:25:16,646 --> 00:25:22,391
A lot of stories that I could go into on this game, a lot of interesting things.

464
00:25:22,411 --> 00:25:25,954
We're going to touch on a bunch here in the next 10-15 minutes.

465
00:25:27,336 --> 00:25:34,322
But a lot of it is tech related, a lot of it is kind of the CPU assistance related.

466
00:25:35,403 --> 00:25:41,309
I've gotten a lot of heat over the years for the cheating that happens in NBA Jam or even

467
00:25:41,369 --> 00:25:41,909
NFL Blitz.

468
00:25:42,870 --> 00:25:43,812
But a lot of games do it.

469
00:25:45,114 --> 00:25:49,139
And we had systems in place to neuter that or to remove it.

470
00:25:49,199 --> 00:25:51,542
But talking about a couple of the tech challenges.

471
00:25:51,563 --> 00:25:55,388
It might sound rather mundane, but it was a big technical

472
00:25:55,448 --> 00:25:56,169
hurdle for us.

473
00:25:57,331 --> 00:25:58,953
Shooting a pass to your teammate.

474
00:25:59,994 --> 00:26:03,999
Initially we had the teammate stop and turn and accept the pass,

475
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:08,704
but of course your opponent would come up and knock you down while the ball is in flight.

476
00:26:09,085 --> 00:26:13,710
So we realized we had to keep the player running at his trajectory.

477
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:18,375
So we locked him in and let him run, and then he would reach back and catch it.

478
00:26:19,477 --> 00:26:24,499
counted the number of ticks before the ball would get to him and we'd start the proper

479
00:26:24,559 --> 00:26:30,361
animation at the right time. But then of course that carried him into the sideline. We didn't

480
00:26:30,401 --> 00:26:35,623
want to ever let a player step out of bounds or pass out of bounds. That was a fail. So he had to

481
00:26:35,683 --> 00:26:40,185
get to the sideline and then he had to glance off and continue to run down the sideline.

482
00:26:41,025 --> 00:26:44,626
And so then the ball at pass time had to take that all into account

483
00:26:45,827 --> 00:26:51,648
And so it was quite a challenge we iterated on that for and really this is about the decisions that had to get made to

484
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:57,530
Emulate what somebody would want to be doing or what somebody would expect to happen while you're playing the game

485
00:26:57,550 --> 00:27:00,971
We want to eliminate frustration from our game and that's something that the other games had

486
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,351
That's why like when you did a pass in other games

487
00:27:03,631 --> 00:27:06,152
They would literally stop and wait for the ball to come to them

488
00:27:06,412 --> 00:27:08,835
Or the ball would just hit you in the body and attach to you.

489
00:27:08,855 --> 00:27:09,395
Right.

490
00:27:09,415 --> 00:27:13,058
We wanted to rotate and make this variety of catches.

491
00:27:13,079 --> 00:27:14,059
Make it look more real.

492
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,941
And then, again, anticipate what you're trying to do.

493
00:27:16,021 --> 00:27:20,686
And so as responsive and as seamless of a gameplay flow

494
00:27:20,746 --> 00:27:22,127
as possible is what we're trying to achieve.

495
00:27:22,507 --> 00:27:24,990
And lots of decisions were made and good code written

496
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:25,830
to do that.

497
00:27:25,910 --> 00:27:26,791
It was a can of worms.

498
00:27:26,891 --> 00:27:29,354
Because, again, imagine that you're shooting a pass.

499
00:27:29,994 --> 00:27:33,518
Well, you know the player's running in this direction, so I'm going to shoot it like this.

500
00:27:34,158 --> 00:27:38,122
But he's really going to glance off the wall halfway through his run and be down there,

501
00:27:38,162 --> 00:27:41,185
so I really need to rotate and shoot it in this way.

502
00:27:41,225 --> 00:27:45,269
Take into account where he'd be after he glances off the wall and travels a little bit in that

503
00:27:45,309 --> 00:27:45,809
amount of time.

504
00:27:45,890 --> 00:27:50,574
And then, so maybe now that opens up behind the back pass or, you know, so there are a

505
00:27:50,614 --> 00:27:52,116
lot of, it was a big can of worms.

506
00:27:53,036 --> 00:27:54,097
So that was one topic.

507
00:27:55,018 --> 00:27:56,359
Leap to Rim for Dunks.

508
00:27:57,059 --> 00:28:01,643
We at Midway, we created this system called Leap At.

509
00:28:02,844 --> 00:28:07,007
And you're probably most familiar with NFL Blitz,

510
00:28:07,227 --> 00:28:09,349
where when you're running at an opponent,

511
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:10,650
you hit the tackle button.

512
00:28:11,190 --> 00:28:14,611
And it's like a missile, a heat-seeking missile.

513
00:28:14,651 --> 00:28:20,052
It rotates and it gets to the victim in X number of ticks.

514
00:28:20,412 --> 00:28:22,532
Well, that same concept is the leap at

515
00:28:22,632 --> 00:28:24,613
for the wrist to the rim.

516
00:28:25,273 --> 00:28:28,174
And so a player would go up for a dunk

517
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:32,195
and we knew we had to reach the rim

518
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:35,875
and based on how many ticks I would establish

519
00:28:35,895 --> 00:28:38,536
for that point of connection

520
00:28:39,176 --> 00:28:40,436
would dictate how high.

521
00:28:41,057 --> 00:28:45,359
the player would go. If I said, well get there in two seconds, well it's going to have to go way up

522
00:28:45,799 --> 00:28:50,001
and then come way down. If it's one second then it's a little bit more normal. Which is ironically

523
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:54,763
how the big dunks happen because like you just by mistake you'd put in some number that was too big

524
00:28:55,063 --> 00:28:57,044
and the guy would shoot up in the air it's like, whoa that was really cool.

525
00:28:57,204 --> 00:29:02,568
Yeah, yeah, I mean, I spent, you know, weeks and weeks and weeks just on animations.

526
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:09,493
That was my, you know, kind of my main focus once we got all this art was crafting all of it together

527
00:29:09,773 --> 00:29:16,679
and creating the dunks and even combining a portion of one dunk, a spin, a spin dunk from

528
00:29:16,739 --> 00:29:21,342
this angle would actually work from this angle if I combined it with this. And so it was like

529
00:29:21,362 --> 00:29:24,745
this big puzzle piece that we were able to put together.

530
00:29:25,105 --> 00:29:26,546
So the dunks became very modular.

531
00:29:27,286 --> 00:29:30,068
Every part of a dunk could then flow

532
00:29:30,108 --> 00:29:32,049
into a different part of another dunk.

533
00:29:32,189 --> 00:29:33,710
And we got really creative with that.

534
00:29:33,750 --> 00:29:36,031
And that's what gave us a lot of a win.

535
00:29:36,051 --> 00:29:36,131
Yeah.

536
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:38,573
And the high dunks were a little bit controversial.

537
00:29:38,613 --> 00:29:41,595
Some people were like, no, no, that's too crazy.

538
00:29:41,635 --> 00:29:43,276
We're trying to make a simulation here.

539
00:29:44,616 --> 00:29:46,457
But we tried to find a balance.

540
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:47,818
Eugene Jarvis.

541
00:29:49,311 --> 00:29:53,672
you know, who was my mentor and somebody that has made,

542
00:29:53,692 --> 00:29:56,373
you know, obviously a big dent in this business.

543
00:29:57,314 --> 00:29:58,914
He would come in, I would show him a dunk,

544
00:29:58,934 --> 00:30:00,635
and he'd say, yeah, that's pretty cool,

545
00:30:00,655 --> 00:30:02,175
but why don't you go a little bit higher?

546
00:30:02,195 --> 00:30:05,516
You know, and, you know, I joke with Ed, you know,

547
00:30:05,757 --> 00:30:07,457
I'm sure he said the same thing to Ed over the years,

548
00:30:07,477 --> 00:30:08,357
like, yeah, that's cool,

549
00:30:08,377 --> 00:30:09,718
but how about a little bit more blood?

550
00:30:10,298 --> 00:30:12,839
You know, and he did the same thing with Smash TV,

551
00:30:12,879 --> 00:30:14,319
and with Mutoid Man, all these things.

552
00:30:14,339 --> 00:30:17,080
So he had a really interesting take on things,

553
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:17,240
but...

554
00:30:18,781 --> 00:30:21,864
So that was the leap at, shattering backboard.

555
00:30:22,965 --> 00:30:24,206
We didn't think we'd get away with it,

556
00:30:24,246 --> 00:30:26,429
but the NBA allowed it.

557
00:30:26,809 --> 00:30:27,890
They soon shut that down.

558
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,573
The next year, they actually eliminated all the NBA games

559
00:30:30,613 --> 00:30:31,534
from doing such a thing.

560
00:30:32,715 --> 00:30:34,376
Beyond Fire Mode and Burger King,

561
00:30:34,917 --> 00:30:38,040
Jamie Rivette, who I mentioned, he's an Australian fellow.

562
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:40,983
I work with him still today, did the Smash TV conversion.

563
00:30:41,243 --> 00:30:42,544
We would walk to Burger King.

564
00:30:44,547 --> 00:30:47,591
For those that know me, I'm like pretty much all business all the time.

565
00:30:47,631 --> 00:30:54,221
I'm always talking about the task at hand and the game that we're working on in off hours.

566
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:56,043
And so we're walking to lunch.

567
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,285
It's kind of annoying sometimes.

568
00:30:57,305 --> 00:30:57,446
Yeah.

569
00:30:58,988 --> 00:31:05,534
But I'm so we're walking and just you know talking about you know, what do we need this game isn't quite there and and

570
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,677
He came up. He said well, what if we went into an on-fire mode?

571
00:31:09,077 --> 00:31:13,902
What if you got stronger somehow and so over the course of the Burger King lunch?

572
00:31:14,282 --> 00:31:17,746
We plotted out the the whole three in a row heating up

573
00:31:18,837 --> 00:31:21,438
being able to goaltend as one of the benefits.

574
00:31:21,858 --> 00:31:24,939
And so in that one lunch, it all kind of coalesced together.

575
00:31:24,999 --> 00:31:27,140
We came back, we told Sal about it,

576
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,460
and he was like, absolutely not.

577
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:30,981
That's the stupidest idea I've ever heard.

578
00:31:31,001 --> 00:31:32,661
Dumbest thing I've ever heard in my entire life.

579
00:31:32,841 --> 00:31:35,922
And he said, I'm not gonna give you any art for any fire.

580
00:31:37,402 --> 00:31:39,324
All right, calm down, calm down.

581
00:31:41,005 --> 00:31:44,907
So I was more in towards the purist side.

582
00:31:44,927 --> 00:31:47,369
You know, I wanted to maintain, OK, this isn't a fantasy game.

583
00:31:47,389 --> 00:31:48,270
This is still basketball.

584
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:50,231
I didn't mind exaggerated stuff.

585
00:31:50,551 --> 00:31:53,513
But then we're like, it kind of kept on going one more step.

586
00:31:53,533 --> 00:31:56,455
But what if we put, you know, what if we put bunny shoes on the guy

587
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:57,576
and it made him run faster?

588
00:31:57,596 --> 00:31:59,337
That did look good though.

589
00:32:00,077 --> 00:32:04,519
So I was just trying to maintain some sense of still television style.

590
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:04,780
Right.

591
00:32:05,000 --> 00:32:05,140
Right.

592
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:07,721
So but because he refused to give me any art.

593
00:32:07,761 --> 00:32:09,942
Correct.

594
00:32:11,283 --> 00:32:15,025
I actually used the Smash TV explosion art.

595
00:32:16,105 --> 00:32:19,427
And we put that in the game and started piecing it together, you know, behind the ball.

596
00:32:19,487 --> 00:32:23,709
And then Sal, I don't know, within a day or hour said, OK, OK, OK, this might be good.

597
00:32:23,769 --> 00:32:23,889
Yeah.

598
00:32:23,929 --> 00:32:28,611
It took some desensitization of all that stuff for me to finally go.

599
00:32:28,972 --> 00:32:32,234
Yeah, okay. I thought Burger King, the flame broiled burger was going to be the thing.

600
00:32:32,254 --> 00:32:35,116
Right, that's what it was. I haven't heard that story before.

601
00:32:35,156 --> 00:32:42,362
Yeah. CPU assistance, I'll touch on this down here. Not very subtle. This is the thing I've

602
00:32:42,402 --> 00:32:44,043
taken a lot of heat for over the years.

603
00:32:46,437 --> 00:32:48,699
This bottom table actually kind of tells it all.

604
00:32:49,439 --> 00:32:54,182
The basic system was every player did have a base

605
00:32:54,682 --> 00:32:57,544
percentage, whether it was for stealing, shooting two

606
00:32:57,604 --> 00:33:01,646
pointers, three pointers, blocking a shot, because

607
00:33:01,686 --> 00:33:04,788
sometimes your hand would touch it, but we would ignore

608
00:33:04,828 --> 00:33:06,749
the collision or just kind of flash the ball.

609
00:33:07,329 --> 00:33:12,932
And then this table below was basically a modifier to that

610
00:33:13,293 --> 00:33:15,634
base value for whatever the topic was.

611
00:33:16,274 --> 00:33:18,315
and you can see them in the middle, there's a zero.

612
00:33:19,276 --> 00:33:21,036
Zero is when the score was tied.

613
00:33:21,617 --> 00:33:25,919
If the score is tied, then do no modification to your base number.

614
00:33:26,479 --> 00:33:31,401
But if you are losing, then it would slide to the left. I'm down by one point, two point.

615
00:33:31,701 --> 00:33:35,363
So we went all the way down by ten points. You can see a twenty-five percent.

616
00:33:36,264 --> 00:33:40,928
uh... you know additional add-on to the already twenty five percent that was

617
00:33:40,988 --> 00:33:42,529
there for say in this example

618
00:33:42,909 --> 00:33:43,810
a three-point shooting

619
00:33:44,310 --> 00:33:45,952
and conversely if you were

620
00:33:45,972 --> 00:33:47,053
uh... winning

621
00:33:47,673 --> 00:33:50,956
up by one two three four those number of points

622
00:33:51,436 --> 00:33:54,619
then it would modify and so you could get down to the point where hey I'm a

623
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:55,580
great three-point shooter

624
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:00,344
but I just nullified you completely because you're up by 15 points.

625
00:34:00,984 --> 00:34:05,708
And so that basic system was running amok through the entire game.

626
00:34:06,108 --> 00:34:11,492
We had probably, I'd say, 40 different locations.

627
00:34:12,052 --> 00:34:14,695
where I would insert this kind of logic

628
00:34:15,155 --> 00:34:17,597
for deflecting passes, rebounding,

629
00:34:17,617 --> 00:34:20,259
you know, goal-tending, shooting, layups,

630
00:34:20,419 --> 00:34:22,021
dunks, doinked dunks.

631
00:34:22,481 --> 00:34:26,144
Everything had percentages that boiled back and forth

632
00:34:26,625 --> 00:34:27,225
based on the score.

633
00:34:27,245 --> 00:34:29,527
Yeah, and we played the game every day,

634
00:34:29,587 --> 00:34:30,808
like multiple times a day.

635
00:34:30,828 --> 00:34:32,850
This is when we could actually do that.

636
00:34:32,990 --> 00:34:34,471
And it was, and every day,

637
00:34:34,511 --> 00:34:35,692
whatever would frustrate us,

638
00:34:35,732 --> 00:34:37,954
we would talk about and try to smooth it out

639
00:34:38,094 --> 00:34:39,996
and clean it out and come up with rules for it.

640
00:34:40,336 --> 00:34:41,896
And we'd even argue, you can't just do that,

641
00:34:41,956 --> 00:34:44,657
you can't just do this, you can't just have a big head

642
00:34:44,697 --> 00:34:46,797
on everybody, whatever it is, but we'd talk about that

643
00:34:46,937 --> 00:34:49,558
and figure out, okay, what's the right balance?

644
00:34:49,638 --> 00:34:52,379
Yeah, the best part of that story that just jogged my memory

645
00:34:52,479 --> 00:34:55,579
is because I was doing all these number modifications

646
00:34:55,959 --> 00:34:59,000
and we were a big gambling crowd inside work.

647
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:02,561
People would come over and wanna play a game for cash,

648
00:35:02,981 --> 00:35:04,621
for vending machine products, whatever it was.

649
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:08,623
And I knew like, you know, what the numbers were.

650
00:35:08,663 --> 00:35:10,144
It's like, why are you trying to play me?

651
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:12,366
It's like, so I was, I was, John Hay,

652
00:35:12,386 --> 00:35:13,707
you know, probably still owes me money,

653
00:35:14,247 --> 00:35:16,429
but you know, took hundreds of dollars

654
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:18,170
from this poor sound guy, right?

655
00:35:18,990 --> 00:35:20,291
John Hay, I hope you're out there somewhere.

656
00:35:22,573 --> 00:35:24,895
So that's CPU assistance, a little story.

657
00:35:25,895 --> 00:35:26,836
Magic in the game.

658
00:35:26,856 --> 00:35:28,917
A lot of little things were magical,

659
00:35:29,798 --> 00:35:32,680
but a couple of things that are noteworthy

660
00:35:33,260 --> 00:35:34,261
is of course the codes.

661
00:35:35,202 --> 00:35:40,425
Codes were of course happening on some of the consumer titles.

662
00:35:40,485 --> 00:35:42,767
It was a growing phenomenon.

663
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:47,668
But both Mortal Kombat and Jam really kind of took it over the top.

664
00:35:48,148 --> 00:35:53,370
This is all small print, but an example of the codes,

665
00:35:53,410 --> 00:35:55,110
we had a CPU assistance off,

666
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,931
so it would turn off all that CPU slider bullshit.

667
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,211
All that cheating, yeah.

668
00:36:01,811 --> 00:36:03,192
Another thing here that's interesting,

669
00:36:04,312 --> 00:36:08,913
I'm at Zynga, I've been at Zynga now for almost seven years,

670
00:36:09,613 --> 00:36:12,974
and we kind of live and breathe data and numbers.

671
00:36:15,496 --> 00:36:23,002
Making a great game in today's world takes not only good gut instincts, good sensibility,

672
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:27,906
but it also takes understanding your consumer and being able to respond to that.

673
00:36:28,526 --> 00:36:33,190
And even back here 25 years ago, the panel on the right here is an example.

674
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:38,872
of some of the data we were tracking at each of these locations.

675
00:36:38,892 --> 00:36:42,913
A coin-op game has battery-backed up CMOS RAM.

676
00:36:43,533 --> 00:36:49,354
And so even when the machine is unplugged, turned off, it can still retain that data.

677
00:36:49,615 --> 00:36:53,716
And we could go into these machines, and we had a secret code, a secret backdoor.

678
00:36:54,156 --> 00:36:56,796
I can still do it on coin-op machines around the country.

679
00:36:57,337 --> 00:37:03,619
and pull up the diagnostics, pull up the CMOS, you know, backed up, battery backed up RAM,

680
00:37:04,100 --> 00:37:09,742
and look at some of the data. Things like how many times they go to the second period,

681
00:37:10,242 --> 00:37:14,464
how many times to the third period, how many people are buying a full game up front,

682
00:37:14,984 --> 00:37:18,146
what are the most popular teams, what's the score differential.

683
00:37:19,146 --> 00:37:22,048
Which controller actually were you most likely to win from?

684
00:37:22,208 --> 00:37:25,211
Which controller, right, to see if there was bias there.

685
00:37:25,291 --> 00:37:25,511
Right.

686
00:37:25,751 --> 00:37:30,554
But a lot of stats were kept and a lot of decisions were made on this

687
00:37:31,015 --> 00:37:35,758
because of course we wanted to optimize and have players get all the way to the end.

688
00:37:36,018 --> 00:37:40,681
It was 50 cents per period, so $2 for a full game.

689
00:37:41,282 --> 00:37:47,046
If we had a player leaving after one period, you know, it was a lost opportunity.

690
00:37:47,826 --> 00:37:52,808
And that is the genesis of that CPU assistance system

691
00:37:53,289 --> 00:37:57,430
because we found that when players were ahead by 10 points

692
00:37:58,131 --> 00:38:00,072
at the end of the first period, they quit.

693
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,893
If they were behind by 10 points, they quit.

694
00:38:03,513 --> 00:38:05,454
But if it's a tight game, they're like,

695
00:38:05,494 --> 00:38:06,835
okay, I see what you got.

696
00:38:07,675 --> 00:38:08,655
You think you can take me?

697
00:38:08,856 --> 00:38:09,316
I'll come back.

698
00:38:09,896 --> 00:38:13,458
And so that's really the genesis of trying to keep it.

699
00:38:13,478 --> 00:38:14,758
And you see it in driving games,

700
00:38:14,978 --> 00:38:16,259
the rubber banding that happens.

701
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:18,741
But I could have been a little bit more subtle.

702
00:38:18,781 --> 00:38:23,764
But no, also, that was also the genesis of the winning team.

703
00:38:24,065 --> 00:38:25,806
If it's a four-player game, the winning team

704
00:38:25,846 --> 00:38:26,747
stays on for free.

705
00:38:27,147 --> 00:38:29,249
Because we wanted to encourage four-player games.

706
00:38:29,449 --> 00:38:32,691
Yeah, in a four-player game, the winning team

707
00:38:32,731 --> 00:38:34,353
gets to stay on the machine for free,

708
00:38:34,633 --> 00:38:36,474
much like a fighting game in the day.

709
00:38:40,087 --> 00:38:42,767
This is a horrific story, but it's a great story.

710
00:38:44,208 --> 00:38:47,309
When you put out a coin-operated game,

711
00:38:48,289 --> 00:38:52,791
we put it out at maybe the 80%, 90% completion point

712
00:38:53,651 --> 00:38:55,111
into a few locations.

713
00:38:55,492 --> 00:38:57,052
And then we go at, you know.

714
00:38:57,853 --> 00:39:02,056
10pm we plug in the EPROMs and we stand back and we watch.

715
00:39:02,136 --> 00:39:02,817
We turn it on and we watch.

716
00:39:02,837 --> 00:39:03,597
Two local arcades.

717
00:39:03,657 --> 00:39:04,198
Local arcades.

718
00:39:04,218 --> 00:39:05,139
Local arcades in our area.

719
00:39:05,239 --> 00:39:05,399
Yeah.

720
00:39:05,899 --> 00:39:13,686
And so one of the first test locations we had the game set up and you'll probably recognize

721
00:39:13,726 --> 00:39:14,426
these panels.

722
00:39:14,646 --> 00:39:20,211
The bottom left there is a typical four player control panel where there's four sticks.

723
00:39:21,032 --> 00:39:24,974
three buttons, and we kind of angle things a little bit to give you a little bit of elbow

724
00:39:25,014 --> 00:39:25,274
room.

725
00:39:25,854 --> 00:39:31,517
But on the image in the upper right, you can see the whole unit where there's a coin door

726
00:39:31,597 --> 00:39:33,778
down below, typical arcade game.

727
00:39:34,198 --> 00:39:40,441
When you plug your token or your quarter into those slots, it would go to a kitty.

728
00:39:40,881 --> 00:39:42,562
The machine has X credits.

729
00:39:43,142 --> 00:39:45,866
two, four, five, you'd put in your coins

730
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,549
and it would just be racking up credits.

731
00:39:48,209 --> 00:39:49,772
Then when you hit your start button

732
00:39:50,092 --> 00:39:51,554
on one of those four stations,

733
00:39:52,576 --> 00:39:54,979
that is when the money comes from the kitty

734
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,122
and you are controlling that station.

735
00:39:57,142 --> 00:39:57,282
Right.

736
00:39:59,145 --> 00:40:04,108
And so we were watching and this kid came up and he looked at the game, he said,

737
00:40:04,128 --> 00:40:05,890
oh, this is kind of interesting. He took his money out.

738
00:40:06,230 --> 00:40:09,832
He started putting quarters into the token and he had a jacket on.

739
00:40:09,872 --> 00:40:14,395
It was wintertime and he tapped the player two start button.

740
00:40:14,496 --> 00:40:16,937
Boom, boom, boom, boom. And he bought into it.

741
00:40:16,957 --> 00:40:18,618
So that's the controller that was unlocked for him.

742
00:40:18,638 --> 00:40:22,321
Yeah, you can see the button here. And he took his coat off, set it down.

743
00:40:22,621 --> 00:40:26,224
But then he lined back up on the machine. He lined up on station number three.

744
00:40:27,340 --> 00:40:29,962
And the way, of course, we coded the game,

745
00:40:30,222 --> 00:40:31,083
there were timeouts.

746
00:40:31,463 --> 00:40:32,964
So when you're trying to pick your team,

747
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:36,847
his cursor was just sitting there, not picking anybody,

748
00:40:37,108 --> 00:40:38,068
but it auto picks.

749
00:40:38,949 --> 00:40:42,092
And then at jump ball time, the players jump up,

750
00:40:42,792 --> 00:40:45,955
and there's AI, and the action begins.

751
00:40:46,015 --> 00:40:47,035
His stick is doing nothing.

752
00:40:47,076 --> 00:40:47,896
He's moving it around.

753
00:40:47,916 --> 00:40:48,677
Right, he's moving his stick.

754
00:40:48,697 --> 00:40:49,477
Yeah, he's moving it.

755
00:40:49,517 --> 00:40:50,018
He's like, yeah.

756
00:40:50,078 --> 00:40:53,280
And the player, whenever player two would get the ball,

757
00:40:53,621 --> 00:40:55,903
he would just stand there, and he'd be dribbling the ball.

758
00:40:55,983 --> 00:40:56,163
And then.

759
00:40:56,363 --> 00:40:58,226
And the CPU would go and steal the ball from him.

760
00:40:58,306 --> 00:40:58,887
Right.

761
00:40:59,207 --> 00:41:00,529
A drone would steal it from him.

762
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:02,472
And so we were embarrassed.

763
00:41:02,492 --> 00:41:03,333
We were like, oh man.

764
00:41:03,373 --> 00:41:07,079
And, you know, one of our kind of rules of thumb was not interrupt players and don't

765
00:41:07,139 --> 00:41:08,080
tell them who we are.

766
00:41:08,100 --> 00:41:08,461
Right.

767
00:41:08,481 --> 00:41:09,582
Like going back into the past.

768
00:41:09,662 --> 00:41:10,063
Yeah.

769
00:41:10,123 --> 00:41:10,223
But.

770
00:41:11,725 --> 00:41:15,689
So I walked up and I said, hey, just so you know,

771
00:41:16,349 --> 00:41:17,650
you're actually on player two.

772
00:41:17,750 --> 00:41:18,111
See these?

773
00:41:18,571 --> 00:41:20,973
It says insert coin there on station three.

774
00:41:21,013 --> 00:41:22,454
You're on these controls.

775
00:41:22,474 --> 00:41:24,396
And he's like, oh, OK, sorry, thanks.

776
00:41:24,876 --> 00:41:25,817
And he shifted over.

777
00:41:25,837 --> 00:41:27,578
And I went back to Sazam.

778
00:41:27,638 --> 00:41:28,559
Man, that's embarrassing.

779
00:41:28,579 --> 00:41:29,380
How are we going to fix this?

780
00:41:29,440 --> 00:41:30,621
And we kept watching.

781
00:41:31,221 --> 00:41:34,964
And about 45 seconds later, he's playing.

782
00:41:35,385 --> 00:41:36,325
And he stops.

783
00:41:36,866 --> 00:41:39,007
And he shifts back over to player three.

784
00:41:40,849 --> 00:41:46,174
Because it was a better experience for him. He had more fun playing a dead controller than controlling his character.

785
00:41:46,395 --> 00:41:46,835
And so

786
00:41:47,996 --> 00:41:50,158
So we were like, oh my god, and okay

787
00:41:50,178 --> 00:41:55,083
So we went back to work that night and we invented this concept of bozo boxes

788
00:41:55,584 --> 00:42:01,850
Where and you've probably seen it when you hit the start button and you get into the game a box comes up on your

789
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:04,513
You know quadrant of the screen that's this one India

790
00:42:05,593 --> 00:42:10,016
You are Scotty Pippin, you are red, you only control Scotty Pippin.

791
00:42:11,677 --> 00:42:17,140
So we remedied it and we put the color on the shoes, you are red.

792
00:42:18,441 --> 00:42:24,544
And we also changed the AI because the AI was juking and jiving.

793
00:42:25,245 --> 00:42:28,667
The AI was too good, it was too aggressive, it was pretty much playing for you.

794
00:42:28,747 --> 00:42:30,508
If you let it, it would pretty much play for you.

795
00:42:30,668 --> 00:42:32,029
So we had to make changes there.

796
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,521
So I'm going to hurry through up here.

797
00:42:35,301 --> 00:42:36,861
You may not have heard of this one.

798
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:40,062
There was actually a hidden tank game in NBA Jam.

799
00:42:41,022 --> 00:42:43,443
Sean Liptack, that brainiac engineer I was telling you

800
00:42:43,483 --> 00:42:47,224
about, was kind of geeking out on 3D, learning 3D.

801
00:42:47,644 --> 00:42:53,605
So he put together on this 2D engine a 3D little engine.

802
00:42:53,645 --> 00:42:56,166
This was a tank that was gliding by.

803
00:42:56,506 --> 00:42:59,567
You could hit the shoot button, and a little square bullet

804
00:42:59,587 --> 00:42:59,987
would go out.

805
00:43:00,027 --> 00:43:00,827
Bom, bom, bom, bom.

806
00:43:01,187 --> 00:43:04,169
And you could blow up these tanks that were gliding around,

807
00:43:04,209 --> 00:43:06,231
and you could kind of rotate with your stick

808
00:43:06,271 --> 00:43:08,212
around this little world.

809
00:43:08,232 --> 00:43:13,176
And I kind of thought, well, what are we going to do with that?

810
00:43:13,276 --> 00:43:14,617
You're wasting your time.

811
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:16,598
We really need to be fixing this other bug over here.

812
00:43:17,499 --> 00:43:21,521
But you know I relented and he kept it in and he said yeah

813
00:43:21,542 --> 00:43:24,444
I just want to be able to show people here in the studio

814
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:30,568
How to activate it so he put in some combination push the stick up. Oh, there's you know swirl and

815
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:34,010
We accidentally launched with that feature

816
00:43:35,071 --> 00:43:36,752
In the in the attract mode yes

817
00:43:36,772 --> 00:43:41,395
So in the attract without putting money in because the whole idea was if you put money in and wanted to get to it

818
00:43:41,736 --> 00:43:43,997
We'd let you do it sure spend your quarter on looking at a tank game

819
00:43:44,097 --> 00:43:47,640
Yeah, so we started getting letters from distributors that,

820
00:43:47,700 --> 00:43:48,701
you know, hey, what's going on?

821
00:43:48,741 --> 00:43:50,583
People can play this game for free.

822
00:43:51,524 --> 00:43:53,685
But luckily, the game wasn't that engaging.

823
00:43:53,705 --> 00:43:56,027
And it would time out after like 60 seconds.

824
00:43:56,067 --> 00:43:58,209
So it didn't really cause a problem on revenue.

825
00:43:59,711 --> 00:44:01,132
Secret players, big topic.

826
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:05,735
You can see here we actually snuck in some Mortal Kombat characters.

827
00:44:06,135 --> 00:44:10,318
The NBA ended up having us pull those characters back out at some point.

828
00:44:10,458 --> 00:44:11,018
No good!

829
00:44:12,940 --> 00:44:19,044
But there's some good footage out there online where Raiden has some electricity

830
00:44:19,084 --> 00:44:19,905
and there were some effects.

831
00:44:20,325 --> 00:44:23,787
Ed approved it at the time, but he was wincing, I think, when he approved it.

832
00:44:24,988 --> 00:44:30,274
And, you know, Bill Clinton, a lot of people ask me about Bill Clinton.

833
00:44:30,294 --> 00:44:31,616
That was really an Acclaim thing.

834
00:44:31,676 --> 00:44:36,582
Acclaim had the home rights to our games, and they called and asked if they could put

835
00:44:36,602 --> 00:44:40,065
a couple more characters in, and so we said sure.

836
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:47,288
I put the secret agent man up there because it's the best headline ever for me being a big NBA fan.

837
00:44:47,888 --> 00:44:52,790
This was from Slam Magazine and you know the story of Mark Tramiel, the NBA's greatest player.

838
00:44:53,431 --> 00:44:58,933
Dan here is the byline on that. One of my favorite articles ever.

839
00:45:00,374 --> 00:45:04,215
Ken Griffey Jr. down there sent us photos, wanted to be in the game. Gary Payton wasn't

840
00:45:04,235 --> 00:45:07,997
in the original roster. These guys are sending their photos with headshots.

841
00:45:08,357 --> 00:45:13,260
Well first he sent us, first he just sent us a picture of his head, like you know, out at the beach somewhere, whatever he was doing.

842
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:19,504
It's like, okay, if you want to be serious about this, we sent him our sheet, that little sheet that we showed you earlier of all the different angles.

843
00:45:19,844 --> 00:45:21,645
And then he looked at that, he's like, yeah, okay, yeah.

844
00:45:21,705 --> 00:45:22,126
Alright, yeah.

845
00:45:22,146 --> 00:45:24,947
He sends us back exactly every picture, perfect.

846
00:45:25,007 --> 00:45:25,568
And I'm like, okay.

847
00:45:25,668 --> 00:45:28,810
This is the best slide in the game, in my opinion.

848
00:45:29,970 --> 00:45:32,372
We were always trying to get reactions out of people

849
00:45:32,992 --> 00:45:37,254
at Midway, whether it be the blood and guts of our games

850
00:45:37,515 --> 00:45:40,716
or the over-the-top dunks, the screaming, the announcing.

851
00:45:41,297 --> 00:45:43,058
Well, here's a letter from a distributor

852
00:45:43,398 --> 00:45:44,799
after NBA Jam came out.

853
00:45:45,219 --> 00:45:46,100
And you can see that.

854
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,201
Your programmers have created a monster.

855
00:45:49,552 --> 00:45:52,375
I think that programmer creative freedom has gone too far.

856
00:45:53,697 --> 00:45:54,898
We thought it was a compliment at first.

857
00:45:55,318 --> 00:45:56,479
It's like, oh yeah, thank you.

858
00:45:56,660 --> 00:46:04,227
And it's because, this is the letter on the left, he references these notes that people

859
00:46:04,247 --> 00:46:06,750
were putting on the side of the cabinet that had the secret codes.

860
00:46:07,391 --> 00:46:08,632
Kids were selling the codes for $5, $10.

861
00:46:11,435 --> 00:46:14,818
and uh... this is before the internet and so it's tough to learn these things

862
00:46:15,419 --> 00:46:18,942
and uh... so he thought that was you know bad and here the games making you

863
00:46:18,962 --> 00:46:21,885
know a couple thousand dollars a week i wish i knew that i could've been selling

864
00:46:21,925 --> 00:46:22,726
codes right

865
00:46:22,846 --> 00:46:24,948
make more money for me

866
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,312
That's a feather in my cap right there.

867
00:46:29,354 --> 00:46:30,095
Playboy bunnies.

868
00:46:30,575 --> 00:46:32,378
When, of course, we got the NBA license,

869
00:46:32,398 --> 00:46:34,240
we wanted to have cheerleaders in the game.

870
00:46:34,540 --> 00:46:37,244
We actually called up Playboy and we asked for models.

871
00:46:37,785 --> 00:46:40,348
And we had, they sent over a couple of models

872
00:46:40,408 --> 00:46:42,811
and they were current in that era.

873
00:46:44,133 --> 00:46:48,456
you know, in the magazines and we shot, you know, a few scenes for them.

874
00:46:48,516 --> 00:46:49,898
It was tactful.

875
00:46:50,118 --> 00:46:50,979
Tactful scenes.

876
00:46:50,999 --> 00:46:54,782
This guy, hey, Hef, yeah, Mark Tremel, send over a few Playboy buddies.

877
00:46:54,802 --> 00:46:56,863
Yeah, we're on California between Belmont and Addison.

878
00:46:57,504 --> 00:46:58,445
What world do you live in?

879
00:46:58,485 --> 00:46:59,966
Yeah, it just, it made sense.

880
00:47:00,266 --> 00:47:01,527
Slick and hash downtown.

881
00:47:01,587 --> 00:47:02,788
At the time, that was the 80s.

882
00:47:02,828 --> 00:47:04,250
Where do you find models in Chicago?

883
00:47:04,270 --> 00:47:05,671
Right, right.

884
00:47:05,871 --> 00:47:06,051
But...

885
00:47:07,813 --> 00:47:12,336
We made a mistake with all these codes.

886
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,758
So many kids, so many people were calling

887
00:47:14,778 --> 00:47:15,899
and asking about these codes.

888
00:47:16,519 --> 00:47:21,062
And we communicated that the cheerleaders were in the game.

889
00:47:21,983 --> 00:47:24,685
And so everybody was trying to find the cheerleaders.

890
00:47:24,725 --> 00:47:26,066
We didn't know how to say no to people.

891
00:47:26,086 --> 00:47:28,928
So they would ask us, are there codes for the cheerleaders?

892
00:47:28,948 --> 00:47:29,749
Can you unlock the cheerleaders?

893
00:47:29,769 --> 00:47:31,470
We're like, yeah, yeah, you can, yeah.

894
00:47:31,690 --> 00:47:36,013
Right, so kids are calling Playboy to find out,

895
00:47:37,013 --> 00:47:40,035
they're getting a hold of these girls at home.

896
00:47:41,196 --> 00:47:44,417
Now it didn't help that we mocked up a false image

897
00:47:44,638 --> 00:47:47,119
of a cheerleader actually, I did that in Deluxe Paint,

898
00:47:47,199 --> 00:47:48,880
I think, yeah, we'll do this someday.

899
00:47:48,900 --> 00:47:50,281
Yeah, so somebody asked, and I said,

900
00:47:50,341 --> 00:47:53,723
Sal, you gotta, let's put a chick on the screen, Duncan.

901
00:47:53,863 --> 00:47:54,383
Great idea.

902
00:47:54,663 --> 00:47:55,423
Yeah, and so.

903
00:47:55,804 --> 00:47:57,144
Jeffrey, you're supposed to be in bed.

904
00:47:57,325 --> 00:47:58,185
Who were you on the phone with?

905
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:00,446
I'm going to have some Playboy codes.

906
00:48:01,467 --> 00:48:01,727
All right.

907
00:48:02,107 --> 00:48:02,407
What?

908
00:48:03,428 --> 00:48:03,708
Yep.

909
00:48:03,968 --> 00:48:05,349
But, yeah, so there's a...

910
00:48:05,369 --> 00:48:05,869
Hold on, I want to...

911
00:48:05,889 --> 00:48:09,632
We eventually did put the cheerleaders in the game, yeah, because, you know, we could

912
00:48:09,672 --> 00:48:12,674
update EPROMs, because we took some heat for it.

913
00:48:12,834 --> 00:48:14,815
Same thing had happened with the pleasure domes on Smash TV.

914
00:48:15,615 --> 00:48:17,176
That's a different story.

915
00:48:17,196 --> 00:48:22,119
So almost wrapping up here, you know, what the fuck happened to Jam?

916
00:48:24,201 --> 00:48:26,283
It's actually a sordid story.

917
00:48:27,544 --> 00:48:37,814
We were working with a claim and a claim wanted the license for themselves, no doubt, and

918
00:48:38,154 --> 00:48:45,241
the head of licensing from a claim had shifted to the NBA and was in charge of licensing

919
00:48:45,281 --> 00:48:45,802
there at the NBA.

920
00:48:45,822 --> 00:48:46,762
The nail in the coffin!

921
00:48:47,343 --> 00:48:49,744
Yeah, exactly.

922
00:48:50,184 --> 00:48:53,045
And one day, we got a phone call from the NBA.

923
00:48:53,205 --> 00:48:54,906
And they said, hey, what are you going

924
00:48:54,926 --> 00:48:56,707
to do with the NBA license?

925
00:48:57,407 --> 00:48:59,028
Are you going to stay the same?

926
00:48:59,228 --> 00:49:00,548
Or what's your plan?

927
00:49:01,069 --> 00:49:03,009
And of course, our natural reaction was, oh, no.

928
00:49:03,049 --> 00:49:04,010
We're going to innovate.

929
00:49:04,090 --> 00:49:05,470
We're going to do great new things.

930
00:49:05,851 --> 00:49:07,211
We're going to go bigger and better.

931
00:49:07,231 --> 00:49:10,092
Because we wanted to keep making NBA games.

932
00:49:10,653 --> 00:49:14,374
And they took that commentary as like, oh, they

933
00:49:14,394 --> 00:49:15,515
don't want to do NBA Jam anymore.

934
00:49:16,490 --> 00:49:19,272
and so they gave it to a claim so a claim

935
00:49:19,973 --> 00:49:21,814
garnered the rights when our contract expired

936
00:49:22,515 --> 00:49:25,337
uh... for the rights to NBA Jam and they just drove it into the ground

937
00:49:25,357 --> 00:49:29,500
uh... here you can see an example of College Slam it's a screen down below

938
00:49:29,520 --> 00:49:32,863
you know centers and forward guards they they made that they made

939
00:49:33,143 --> 00:49:38,768
this NBA Jam Extreme, you know, taking dunking from half court, doing all sorts of stupid

940
00:49:38,808 --> 00:49:42,551
things and really ruined that brand.

941
00:49:42,571 --> 00:49:45,253
They still gave us the NBA license though.

942
00:49:45,453 --> 00:49:51,799
So while they handed over the NBA Jam name license to Acclaim right after they said,

943
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:52,719
but you can still have...

944
00:49:52,739 --> 00:49:53,060
They placated it.

945
00:49:53,320 --> 00:49:55,361
Yeah, you can still have an NBA license.

946
00:49:55,381 --> 00:49:55,821
Here you go.

947
00:49:56,001 --> 00:49:57,442
We did NBA Hang Time next.

948
00:49:57,682 --> 00:50:00,563
It was, that game actually holds up really well.

949
00:50:00,623 --> 00:50:01,584
It's more fun than Jam.

950
00:50:01,644 --> 00:50:02,024
It was better.

951
00:50:02,044 --> 00:50:05,165
And then we eventually did NBA Showtime 3D

952
00:50:05,705 --> 00:50:06,566
after we had done Blitz.

953
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,627
So that's a little story on that.

954
00:50:09,047 --> 00:50:10,608
But the legacy lives on.

955
00:50:11,028 --> 00:50:14,269
I was driving through LA just here a few weeks ago.

956
00:50:14,449 --> 00:50:15,870
Boom, shock lock on a window.

957
00:50:15,890 --> 00:50:19,272
I go in, here's a NBA Jam jacket.

958
00:50:19,432 --> 00:50:21,693
They're selling, you can see the Team Select.

959
00:50:22,173 --> 00:50:26,775
For each of the different teams that were in that original game, you can buy that.

960
00:50:26,795 --> 00:50:34,700
And they even had a Mark Tramiel, Duncan Funk, you can see there, as a secret character t-shirt that you can buy.

961
00:50:34,720 --> 00:50:39,462
And up in the upper right, you can see a Boom Shakalaka.

962
00:50:39,622 --> 00:50:43,724
Some of the teams in the NBA have grabbed Tim Kitzerow.

963
00:50:44,345 --> 00:50:49,468
and said, hey, can you come in and do something special

964
00:50:49,508 --> 00:50:54,891
for our NBA Jam Day, putting the new current players

965
00:50:55,131 --> 00:50:56,993
into that mindset.

966
00:50:57,573 --> 00:51:01,615
And Tim, you are Mr. Boomshakalaka.

967
00:51:03,116 --> 00:51:03,897
It's amazing.

968
00:51:04,677 --> 00:51:07,859
He has really almost single-handedly kept

969
00:51:07,939 --> 00:51:10,481
the energy over the last several years.

970
00:51:10,501 --> 00:51:11,141
I've got to pay rent.

971
00:51:11,161 --> 00:51:12,222
I've got to do something.

972
00:51:12,322 --> 00:51:12,562
And yeah.

973
00:51:13,743 --> 00:51:17,524
I went with the claim. I was a whore. I took the money. Then I came back for hang tights.

974
00:51:17,544 --> 00:51:19,545
I hate those new gray guys. I'm glad you took the license.

975
00:51:19,605 --> 00:51:23,687
I had to put this in here, rib Tim a little bit. I was going through all my paperwork.

976
00:51:23,727 --> 00:51:27,308
I found the original contract with Tim there in 1989.

977
00:51:27,408 --> 00:51:28,929
$600 we paid Tim for all of that commentary.

978
00:51:35,952 --> 00:51:37,273
Yeah, it's been amazing.

979
00:51:37,373 --> 00:51:41,496
So, and he's gotten a lot of great, you know, I think publicity and gags.

980
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,339
Here you can see he's with Fox Sports.

981
00:51:45,320 --> 00:51:51,725
Tim and I did a NBA Jam Day at the Staples Center here just in January, where everybody

982
00:51:51,745 --> 00:51:55,808
who went into the stadium received an NBA Jam t-shirt.

983
00:51:56,009 --> 00:51:59,531
Limited edition, but they're worth something now because Blake Griffin left a week later.

984
00:51:59,812 --> 00:52:00,512
Right, that's right.

985
00:52:00,733 --> 00:52:00,953
Right.

986
00:52:00,973 --> 00:52:02,994
Blake and DeAndre, the Boomshakalaka brothers.

987
00:52:03,495 --> 00:52:09,659
Yeah, so you can see Tim and I, we pumped up the crowd and, you know, he's just been great at

988
00:52:09,759 --> 00:52:16,424
kind of keeping the brand alive, so thank you for that. Started my career, thank you. Yeah, yeah.

989
00:52:17,124 --> 00:52:23,548
And with that, we wanted to open it up if there were any questions,

990
00:52:24,809 --> 00:52:27,111
you know, relevant to JAM or even beyond JAM.

991
00:52:29,203 --> 00:52:31,185
We'd be more than happy to address those.

992
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:35,069
There are microphones here to the sides if anybody wants to

993
00:52:35,729 --> 00:52:48,181
partake in that.

994
00:52:48,201 --> 00:52:48,241
Hi.

995
00:52:48,942 --> 00:52:51,444
You kind of glanced on it in the presentation, the

996
00:52:51,584 --> 00:52:52,505
overtime is dollars.

997
00:52:53,026 --> 00:52:53,266
Yes.

998
00:52:55,278 --> 00:53:02,301
And the scale of if you're tied, then you don't mess with the stats.

999
00:53:03,882 --> 00:53:11,364
I missed a dunk when the score was tied on the buzzer.

1000
00:53:11,485 --> 00:53:12,965
Well, remember I said there were about 40 spots.

1001
00:53:14,346 --> 00:53:17,027
I remember you mentioned that, John.

1002
00:53:17,047 --> 00:53:17,388
Yeah, so...

1003
00:53:17,408 --> 00:53:17,668
Snowgun!

1004
00:53:17,708 --> 00:53:18,068
Running!

1005
00:53:18,448 --> 00:53:19,349
Yeah, yeah.

1006
00:53:19,429 --> 00:53:24,312
If you're down by three, you know, with five seconds left, you know, you're going to make

1007
00:53:24,352 --> 00:53:27,834
the shot, you know, more often.

1008
00:53:28,815 --> 00:53:33,698
So there were other special rules, but if you did the CPU assistance off secret code,

1009
00:53:33,998 --> 00:53:34,999
it nullified even those.

1010
00:53:35,059 --> 00:53:37,200
Yeah, it was Shaquille O'Neal that was a little pissed off.

1011
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:38,321
Yeah, John, I can imagine.

1012
00:53:39,561 --> 00:53:41,002
A free throw I would have gotten.

1013
00:53:41,022 --> 00:53:43,623
I'm sorry about that.

1014
00:53:45,324 --> 00:53:47,926
My actual question, was that a midway thing?

1015
00:53:47,966 --> 00:53:50,127
Was that something you were told to do?

1016
00:53:51,087 --> 00:53:53,829
No, that was just, you know, my instinct.

1017
00:53:53,869 --> 00:53:56,991
You were evil.

1018
00:53:58,171 --> 00:54:01,813
I think I can start to heal now. Thank you.

1019
00:54:01,853 --> 00:54:03,074
Nothing personal, just business.

1020
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:07,939
Thank you guys so much for the panel, also for the game, the games, huge fan.

1021
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:14,685
Is there a kill switch or some sort of weird way that the versions of the game with, for example, Michael Jordan,

1022
00:54:14,705 --> 00:54:17,328
would just somehow find their way to the rest of the world?

1023
00:54:17,368 --> 00:54:20,851
I say that mostly from a historical preservation perspective,

1024
00:54:20,871 --> 00:54:25,116
because there are a lot of people who really do want to have that sort of stuff for future generations.

1025
00:54:25,236 --> 00:54:25,396
Thanks.

1026
00:54:25,556 --> 00:54:30,077
Yeah, there are EPROMs out there of NBA GM with Michael Jordan.

1027
00:54:30,097 --> 00:54:31,257
He was in the original game.

1028
00:54:31,697 --> 00:54:34,517
I know Gary Payton has said recently, he's got it.

1029
00:54:34,557 --> 00:54:35,158
He's shown it.

1030
00:54:35,658 --> 00:54:36,738
I have EPROMs.

1031
00:54:37,118 --> 00:54:38,418
I don't have a cabinet anymore.

1032
00:54:38,738 --> 00:54:41,799
So I can't plug the EPROMs in to confirm they're still working.

1033
00:54:42,359 --> 00:54:44,679
But it's on my list of things to do

1034
00:54:44,759 --> 00:54:48,760
is to actually plug those in somewhere and test them out.

1035
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,600
And then I will be more than happy to release them.

1036
00:54:52,120 --> 00:54:53,061
Yeah, I understand.

1037
00:54:53,181 --> 00:54:53,641
Yeah.

1038
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:53,901
Yeah.

1039
00:54:53,921 --> 00:54:54,441
You and Arcade.

1040
00:54:54,861 --> 00:54:54,981
Ma'am.

1041
00:54:56,451 --> 00:54:57,893
Hey, so thank you very much for the talk.

1042
00:54:58,273 --> 00:54:59,315
Extremely entertaining.

1043
00:54:59,335 --> 00:55:03,240
I'm curious, since we're talking a bit about preservation here,

1044
00:55:03,621 --> 00:55:06,124
there are several revisions of NBA Jam in MAME,

1045
00:55:06,184 --> 00:55:09,829
including revisions of TE with the now-deleted Mortal Kombat

1046
00:55:09,869 --> 00:55:11,671
characters and all the other goofy things.

1047
00:55:11,972 --> 00:55:14,255
And you mentioned the tank game.

1048
00:55:15,236 --> 00:55:20,081
And I'm pretty sure the ROMs for that version of the game are still in there,

1049
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:24,726
but is it possible to release the actual code to access that?

1050
00:55:25,146 --> 00:55:26,988
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, we can do that.

1051
00:55:27,549 --> 00:55:30,652
I'll give you my business card at the end of this.

1052
00:55:31,113 --> 00:55:31,373
Awesome.

1053
00:55:31,473 --> 00:55:33,816
I will reach out to Sean and get that to you.

1054
00:55:34,657 --> 00:55:35,457
Wonderful, thank you.

1055
00:55:35,578 --> 00:55:35,818
Yeah, yeah.

1056
00:55:36,078 --> 00:55:36,919
Sell them, make some money.

1057
00:55:37,869 --> 00:55:40,272
So I played the game a ton in college,

1058
00:55:40,312 --> 00:55:42,475
and it actually got me interested in the NBA.

1059
00:55:43,697 --> 00:55:46,200
And I was wondering if you ever heard from the NBA

1060
00:55:46,340 --> 00:55:48,684
if the game itself had any impact on their business.

1061
00:55:48,804 --> 00:55:49,184
It is.

1062
00:55:49,325 --> 00:55:50,186
It's a great thing.

1063
00:55:50,586 --> 00:55:54,352
It seems crazy to state that NBA Jam.

1064
00:55:55,133 --> 00:55:59,677
had an impact on the success of the NBA, but there's no question it did.

1065
00:56:00,418 --> 00:56:03,901
Not just from the anecdotal comments we've had, but from the NBA themselves

1066
00:56:04,602 --> 00:56:08,365
have said that a lot of players were not fans of the NBA,

1067
00:56:08,685 --> 00:56:11,768
but the millions played the game and then they became engaged.

1068
00:56:12,149 --> 00:56:13,670
I hear it all the time, so no question.

1069
00:56:14,591 --> 00:56:17,051
On that point too, Russell Wilson's a good example.

1070
00:56:17,091 --> 00:56:21,572
He's a huge fan of NBA Jam and he lived in North Carolina,

1071
00:56:21,592 --> 00:56:25,233
but he was a Sonics fan and he wanted to play as a Sonics guy

1072
00:56:25,253 --> 00:56:26,534
because he loved their uniform.

1073
00:56:26,554 --> 00:56:28,874
He said, I was a bigger basketball fan and knew

1074
00:56:29,114 --> 00:56:31,575
about players and teams he said I would never have known about.

1075
00:56:31,715 --> 00:56:33,915
And so that's really everybody's experience.

1076
00:56:33,935 --> 00:56:36,836
There was only a couple games on a week and it was the big market,

1077
00:56:36,856 --> 00:56:41,057
the Celtics-Lakers, so it was a way to introduce those smaller

1078
00:56:41,117 --> 00:56:43,078
market teams and players that you would have never heard of.

1079
00:56:43,338 --> 00:56:43,478
Yeah.

1080
00:56:44,900 --> 00:56:50,745
Hey guys, I've been working with Jarvis for the last 15 years at Raw and I've seen you guys around at stuff, but

1081
00:56:51,785 --> 00:56:57,510
Just in that line a lot of my friends like John Hay and Petro and stuff appeared in all your games and stuff

1082
00:56:58,070 --> 00:56:59,612
Are there any guys?

1083
00:57:00,773 --> 00:57:07,838
That have not been revealed that have like really secret like yeah joystick combinations and stuff in addition with the initials that yeah

1084
00:57:08,138 --> 00:57:13,603
Nobody knows I've gotten a lot over the years and and actually everything was exposed

1085
00:57:15,099 --> 00:57:19,942
So there's no codes unexposed that I'm aware of.

1086
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,223
There's codes.

1087
00:57:21,263 --> 00:57:21,624
I would know.

1088
00:57:21,864 --> 00:57:22,344
Yeah.

1089
00:57:22,604 --> 00:57:23,265
Yeah.

1090
00:57:23,345 --> 00:57:24,266
Yeah.

1091
00:57:24,286 --> 00:57:26,147
Well, you know, one interesting thing real quick.

1092
00:57:27,488 --> 00:57:28,448
Have you ever heard the story

1093
00:57:28,508 --> 00:57:30,790
about the haunted NBA Jam machines?

1094
00:57:31,090 --> 00:57:31,851
Oh yeah.

1095
00:57:31,891 --> 00:57:32,371
Petrovich.

1096
00:57:32,451 --> 00:57:32,591
Yeah.

1097
00:57:32,611 --> 00:57:33,252
This is the truth.

1098
00:57:33,352 --> 00:57:35,333
Yeah, Drozd Petrovich died,

1099
00:57:35,353 --> 00:57:37,074
I think it was in a car accident or something.

1100
00:57:37,355 --> 00:57:37,735
Tragic.

1101
00:57:38,335 --> 00:57:40,757
Yeah, he was a starter, he was in the game,

1102
00:57:40,977 --> 00:57:41,798
he was on the nets.

1103
00:57:42,452 --> 00:57:46,176
And after he died, we were walking through the factory.

1104
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,038
We were just even sitting in our offices.

1105
00:57:48,058 --> 00:57:48,398
Yeah.

1106
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:52,623
The coin-op game started saying, Petrovich, Tim's call.

1107
00:57:52,683 --> 00:57:53,423
Oh, that was good.

1108
00:57:53,483 --> 00:57:55,325
And every once in a while, it would just

1109
00:57:55,365 --> 00:57:58,629
say, Petrovich, in the attract mode, with the audio off.

1110
00:57:59,469 --> 00:58:00,030
It was crazy.

1111
00:58:00,050 --> 00:58:01,211
A weird bug, right?

1112
00:58:03,021 --> 00:58:07,585
Hi, again, thank you so much for just sharing all these experiences.

1113
00:58:08,306 --> 00:58:13,170
When you introduced the injured stat, how much did that really affect players during games?

1114
00:58:14,151 --> 00:58:16,373
The injured stat had no bearing.

1115
00:58:16,713 --> 00:58:16,973
Okay.

1116
00:58:17,874 --> 00:58:22,298
And I bring this up because for many of us who did play at home,

1117
00:58:22,899 --> 00:58:24,760
and as we all got to be very good...

1118
00:58:25,821 --> 00:58:28,423
instead of two on two, we played one on one on one on one.

1119
00:58:29,344 --> 00:58:32,627
And to try to see whoever had the highest injured stat

1120
00:58:33,187 --> 00:58:34,669
then essentially pays everybody else.

1121
00:58:34,929 --> 00:58:35,149
Right.

1122
00:58:35,229 --> 00:58:36,010
Yeah.

1123
00:58:36,530 --> 00:58:40,734
Yeah, we would do similar to use that to highlight

1124
00:58:40,814 --> 00:58:43,316
who was weak at avoidance.

1125
00:58:44,277 --> 00:58:46,619
An injury stat is when you would get knocked down.

1126
00:58:47,100 --> 00:58:49,221
And so we would kind of laugh like, oh, you can't even

1127
00:58:49,442 --> 00:58:50,903
swirl around these guys effectively.

1128
00:58:50,923 --> 00:58:51,163
Right.

1129
00:58:52,164 --> 00:58:52,464
Cool.

1130
00:58:52,844 --> 00:58:53,185
Thank you.

1131
00:58:53,385 --> 00:58:53,665
Thank you.

1132
00:58:55,090 --> 00:58:55,631
Hi, thanks.

1133
00:58:56,313 --> 00:58:58,578
Just a quick question, what did happen with Michael Jordan?

1134
00:58:58,758 --> 00:58:59,821
Was it like licensing?

1135
00:58:59,861 --> 00:59:02,286
Well, they offered him $600 and he turned it down.

1136
00:59:05,869 --> 00:59:12,411
Well, Michael Jordan, he pulled out of all NBA licensing, because all the players just

1137
00:59:12,591 --> 00:59:14,552
split the licensing money equally.

1138
00:59:15,012 --> 00:59:17,873
And so he thought, hey, I can cut my own deals and get a better thing.

1139
00:59:17,893 --> 00:59:19,454
And of course, he did an EA game.

1140
00:59:19,714 --> 00:59:23,516
Probably didn't really pan out that well for him, although maybe Nike, you know, he was

1141
00:59:23,556 --> 00:59:25,296
able to do something instead of Converse or something.

1142
00:59:25,817 --> 00:59:32,724
But he eventually did get hit one of those NBA jams with the Jordan E-Proms

1143
00:59:33,105 --> 00:59:35,207
because Gary Payton and he were really tight.

1144
00:59:35,668 --> 00:59:40,273
And Gary Payton is really the one who reached out to get himself in the game,

1145
00:59:40,813 --> 00:59:44,858
Griffey in the game, and Jordan in the game so that Jordan would have a copy.

1146
00:59:46,579 --> 00:59:49,260
Shaq actually bought two copies when it came out.

1147
00:59:50,020 --> 00:59:51,321
And this is a funny story.

1148
00:59:51,641 --> 00:59:53,862
He took one of the coin-ops, had it at home,

1149
00:59:54,022 --> 00:59:57,063
and the other one went on their team airplane.

1150
00:59:57,764 --> 00:59:59,785
As they traveled around the country on road trips,

1151
01:00:00,245 --> 01:00:01,565
they would take it out of the plane

1152
01:00:01,665 --> 01:00:03,226
and they would wheel it into his suite,

1153
01:00:03,586 --> 01:00:05,107
and the players would gamble.

1154
01:00:05,587 --> 01:00:06,247
He's told me this.

1155
01:00:06,608 --> 01:00:07,868
They would gamble all night.

1156
01:00:07,908 --> 01:00:10,149
They wouldn't go out to clubs and other stuff.

1157
01:00:10,489 --> 01:00:12,350
They stayed in there gambling on NBA Jam.

1158
01:00:12,570 --> 01:00:14,591
So in a way we saved the world a little bit.

1159
01:00:14,731 --> 01:00:15,972
Right, right.

1160
01:00:16,052 --> 01:00:16,432
Yeah.

1161
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:17,753
Yeah.

1162
01:00:18,633 --> 01:00:19,433
Well, thank you so much.

1163
01:00:19,653 --> 01:00:20,894
One more?

1164
01:00:21,754 --> 01:00:23,135
I just wanted to say thank you guys

1165
01:00:23,195 --> 01:00:26,076
for letting me be my brother virtually,

1166
01:00:26,476 --> 01:00:28,177
as well as in real life in basketball.

1167
01:00:28,197 --> 01:00:30,938
So that was something I really enjoyed doing.

1168
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:34,880
Just not so much on the shoulda, coulda, woulda.

1169
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:37,761
Was there anything you guys could have done to keep?

1170
01:00:38,514 --> 01:00:40,995
the game at Midway or was there things that you were like,

1171
01:00:41,035 --> 01:00:42,316
man, I wish I really would have done that,

1172
01:00:42,396 --> 01:00:44,317
just for some other people that might be in the same situation?

1173
01:00:44,337 --> 01:00:46,499
Yeah, it was really just the relationship.

1174
01:00:46,559 --> 01:00:48,600
If we'd had maybe a better relationship with

1175
01:00:48,660 --> 01:00:50,801
the licensing management people there at the NBA,

1176
01:00:50,841 --> 01:00:54,383
we could have made the opportunity extend,

1177
01:00:55,124 --> 01:00:58,306
and we would not have driven it into the ground as they did.

1178
01:00:58,386 --> 01:01:00,427
So yeah, that's great.

1179
01:01:00,447 --> 01:01:03,229
So this is a great birthday present for me, a great opportunity.

1180
01:01:03,249 --> 01:01:03,729
Thanks everybody.
