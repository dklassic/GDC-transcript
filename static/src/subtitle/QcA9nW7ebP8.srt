00:00:11,706 --> 00:00:17,248
Hello, and welcome to the talk about how to encourage social and emotional learning in-game

2
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:19,349
in a data and research-driven manner.

3
00:00:21,070 --> 00:00:21,830
So let's start.

4
00:00:25,852 --> 00:00:28,033
A meme always says more than a thousand words.

5
00:00:30,037 --> 00:00:35,643
And today we will prove that at least one of these do exist, if the right circumstances are there.

6
00:00:38,325 --> 00:00:42,709
My name is Jane Scullman, and I'm executive producer for Star Stable,

7
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:48,455
and also the platform for the pilot that we are going to talk about.

8
00:00:51,190 --> 00:00:54,892
Star Stable is one of three products within Star Stable Entertainment,

9
00:00:55,613 --> 00:00:58,714
and the other two being Wild Song and Curry.

10
00:00:59,715 --> 00:01:02,056
Besides being the executive producer for Star Stable,

11
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,697
or at the time, technical producer,

12
00:01:03,958 --> 00:01:06,979
I was for this pilot also the driver and initiative taker.

13
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:09,721
On stage, I have two friends with me,

14
00:01:10,782 --> 00:01:12,583
and without them, this pilot wouldn't exist.

15
00:01:14,470 --> 00:01:16,032
Hi, my name's Alex.

16
00:01:16,352 --> 00:01:17,894
I'm the founder of Otterloo.

17
00:01:18,174 --> 00:01:21,478
We build AI technology to create and maintain

18
00:01:21,558 --> 00:01:22,659
positive communities.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,342
I previously worked at Google within their trust

20
00:01:25,402 --> 00:01:26,784
and safety teams for a number of years.

21
00:01:29,043 --> 00:01:33,147
And hi, my name is Paulina and I'm the co-founder and CEO of Pepe Agency.

22
00:01:33,788 --> 00:01:38,252
We are a Swedish based agency specialized in developing social and emotional

23
00:01:38,292 --> 00:01:40,054
learning experiences through play.

24
00:01:40,735 --> 00:01:44,859
And today I'll share a little bit about how we went about when we crafted the

25
00:01:45,019 --> 00:01:49,984
in-game message that could encourage a more positive and kind behavior online.

26
00:01:53,613 --> 00:01:59,555
So before we go into the pilot, let's talk a bit about the platform that we use, the Star Stable game.

27
00:02:00,315 --> 00:02:07,197
We are an MMO and our target audience is girls. You come for the horses and the equestrian dream,

28
00:02:07,457 --> 00:02:12,879
but you stay for the friends and the community. On screens we see four of the main characters,

29
00:02:13,059 --> 00:02:19,341
the Soul Riders. The Soul Riders are a symbol for friendship, kindness, and a bit of magic.

30
00:02:20,481 --> 00:02:22,061
They all have their own horses.

31
00:02:22,763 --> 00:02:28,085
just as the player, and the players can choose between 100 different horse breeds, and still

32
00:02:28,125 --> 00:02:28,466
counting.

33
00:02:29,526 --> 00:02:33,147
Some other facts about the games, we have been around for 10 years, and we have 650,000

34
00:02:34,428 --> 00:02:35,848
monthly active users.

35
00:02:36,569 --> 00:02:43,511
We are translated into 14 different languages, and are played in 180 countries.

36
00:02:44,191 --> 00:02:49,253
We do weekly releases, so we promise our players something new every week, and we have never

37
00:02:49,333 --> 00:02:49,953
failed, actually.

38
00:02:50,969 --> 00:02:53,171
And we also are cross-platform today.

39
00:02:53,271 --> 00:02:57,855
So if you are on a mobile iOS and I'm on desktop PC or Mac,

40
00:02:58,295 --> 00:03:00,037
we can play in the same PlayStation.

41
00:03:01,218 --> 00:03:05,902
And it's also very proud to say that we are 54% women

42
00:03:06,262 --> 00:03:06,863
within the studio.

43
00:03:09,345 --> 00:03:13,529
And let's visit our world, the magical Jorvik.

44
00:03:41,645 --> 00:03:41,705
You

45
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:31,160
So let's go to the pilot.

46
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:34,000
We had a challenge and we asked ourselves,

47
00:04:34,180 --> 00:04:37,341
are we the police or are we the paths to our players?

48
00:04:38,642 --> 00:04:41,903
Being an online game and community for girls

49
00:04:41,963 --> 00:04:43,163
between eight and above,

50
00:04:43,443 --> 00:04:45,484
there are some rules and regulations to follow

51
00:04:45,504 --> 00:04:47,785
when it comes to the social elements of the game.

52
00:04:48,465 --> 00:04:50,805
Social elements like the chat

53
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:52,306
and other in-game communications.

54
00:04:54,331 --> 00:04:58,695
And of course we also want to keep our players safe and be able to play in an environment

55
00:04:58,755 --> 00:05:00,577
without being bullied or treated badly.

56
00:05:00,978 --> 00:05:05,662
And at the same time not compromising the fun of connecting to new friends.

57
00:05:07,504 --> 00:05:12,008
So we asked ourselves if there was some other way to create a good and caring environment

58
00:05:12,208 --> 00:05:15,731
than banning the players that behave badly and acting like the police.

59
00:05:19,221 --> 00:05:24,147
Almost two years ago, we stopped using the more traditional method for in-game chats

60
00:05:24,267 --> 00:05:28,372
that filter out words and ban players automatically when abusing these words.

61
00:05:29,253 --> 00:05:33,838
We first had a blacklist approach, which means a list of words that players can't use,

62
00:05:33,918 --> 00:05:35,901
they get hashed out in the chat.

63
00:05:36,882 --> 00:05:41,064
That was not enough for creating a good environment, so we switched to white listening,

64
00:05:41,384 --> 00:05:46,666
which means a list with allowed words. And those are the only words that the player can't use,

65
00:05:46,966 --> 00:05:53,890
which of course creates some kind of limitation. So this let us, both approaches created

66
00:05:53,910 --> 00:05:59,732
dissatisfied players due to the limitation and also not understanding why you got banned,

67
00:06:00,753 --> 00:06:02,173
as you can see on the screen here.

68
00:06:03,930 --> 00:06:10,013
So this led us to take a more modern attitude and we started to explore what AI moderation could do for us.

69
00:06:10,693 --> 00:06:17,235
Today, all our in-game communication channels are moderated based on AI with support for our human moderation team.

70
00:06:18,136 --> 00:06:24,278
But we were still not 100% satisfied with the player environment and we started to ask what more could be done.

71
00:06:25,685 --> 00:06:30,687
At the same time, I got in contact with Alex through LinkedIn and we had a first conversation

72
00:06:30,747 --> 00:06:33,909
about AI in relation to online communities and games.

73
00:06:35,489 --> 00:06:39,711
And we soon realized we had the same future vision for in-game communication.

74
00:06:40,011 --> 00:06:43,893
The vision we discussed was something that I believe was the solution to our challenge.

75
00:06:45,432 --> 00:06:53,720
Our players seek to exchange ideas about issues like mental health, identity, family, school, and life's big questions.

76
00:06:54,821 --> 00:07:02,089
Policing created a lot of frustration for our player community, because it didn't let them to talk about things they wanted to talk about.

77
00:07:02,929 --> 00:07:10,197
We of course comply with all regulations there are, but beyond that, who are we to stop players from talking about what matters to them?

78
00:07:12,105 --> 00:07:15,628
And just like in the schoolyard, they will talk about these topics.

79
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,052
Our job is to protect them, not to cut them off from important conversations with friends.

80
00:07:24,515 --> 00:07:28,458
So with the joint vision, we started to become more concrete.

81
00:07:28,879 --> 00:07:31,941
And I invited some other key people from Star Stable.

82
00:07:32,802 --> 00:07:38,206
Our director of customer experience, Cecilia Munte, and director of community, Jane Billett.

83
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:45,902
They got on board with the vision and the three of us created space in our current roadmaps in order to enable this pilot.

84
00:07:46,942 --> 00:07:53,064
The pilot also included three tech teams. It was the game server team, backend and also the client.

85
00:07:54,304 --> 00:07:59,046
It also was supported by marketing and our communication and community team, of course.

86
00:08:01,026 --> 00:08:05,588
Each team brought their knowledge and together we started to create a foundation for the pilot.

87
00:08:08,198 --> 00:08:11,039
So with a joint vision and a great pilot team,

88
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:12,139
we were ready to go.

89
00:08:13,099 --> 00:08:16,320
And the aim of the pilot was to effectively address

90
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:19,661
and decrease negative social behavior in-game

91
00:08:19,801 --> 00:08:23,002
without sacrificing our players' social engagement.

92
00:08:24,183 --> 00:08:26,243
We decided to run the pilot in UK,

93
00:08:26,483 --> 00:08:28,684
using three servers during six weeks period.

94
00:08:29,404 --> 00:08:30,985
In order to verify the pilot,

95
00:08:31,065 --> 00:08:32,725
we would use two groups of players,

96
00:08:32,925 --> 00:08:34,626
a treatment group and a control group.

97
00:08:35,947 --> 00:08:39,690
So when a player in the treatment group was detected to send harmful messages,

98
00:08:40,390 --> 00:08:46,276
they got a pop-up with a message to stop, think, and act before sending the next message.

99
00:08:47,196 --> 00:08:50,339
No one was blocked from sending more harmful messages,

100
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:53,041
but instead encouraged to take a better decision.

101
00:08:54,583 --> 00:08:59,907
And in order to get the right message on the pop-up, we added Pepe Agency to the pilot.

102
00:09:04,388 --> 00:09:08,972
Yes, so some of you might be thinking, why social and emotional learning?

103
00:09:09,112 --> 00:09:12,454
What is that and how can that be used to reduce toxicity?

104
00:09:13,475 --> 00:09:18,239
Well, to start off, when we're using traditional methods like banning players,

105
00:09:19,380 --> 00:09:23,162
we're risking to leave them feeling perhaps even more frustrated

106
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:26,005
or unaware of their hurtful behavior.

107
00:09:27,473 --> 00:09:30,155
To give you a comparison, I'm sure many of us in here

108
00:09:30,515 --> 00:09:32,977
have found ourselves in moments when we've lashed out

109
00:09:33,057 --> 00:09:36,119
either at our partner, our kids, or maybe a friend.

110
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:38,421
And in the moment after, we thought,

111
00:09:38,561 --> 00:09:40,262
oh gosh, why did I do that?

112
00:09:41,443 --> 00:09:43,464
And so what if you would had a little person

113
00:09:43,504 --> 00:09:45,105
on your shoulder that told you,

114
00:09:45,125 --> 00:09:49,288
hey Paulina, why don't you stop and think for a moment?

115
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:54,274
I'm sure that our behaviour would have been completely different.

116
00:09:55,054 --> 00:10:00,076
And that was the exact feeling that we wanted to provide players on Star Stable.

117
00:10:00,856 --> 00:10:06,418
To give them guidance to change their behaviour so that they could form positive relationships.

118
00:10:07,759 --> 00:10:12,880
And we saw that moment as a skill-building opportunity, but it was important that we

119
00:10:12,940 --> 00:10:14,861
did not judge their current behaviour.

120
00:10:18,152 --> 00:10:23,777
And the skills that we wanted to install are not only about being able to label your emotions

121
00:10:23,917 --> 00:10:28,681
and the feelings that you're feeling in that heated moment, it's also about understanding

122
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:34,486
other people's emotions and how you can use that information to form positive and healthy

123
00:10:34,546 --> 00:10:35,326
relationships.

124
00:10:38,009 --> 00:10:42,532
Now, when we design, we have a principle to design with empathy.

125
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:46,936
And in this case, we needed to go to the root of why people bully.

126
00:10:48,193 --> 00:10:52,716
In many cases, it's because you feel unhappy, scared, or unheard.

127
00:10:53,396 --> 00:10:57,719
It might be because of something that happened at home, or it could be something that happened

128
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,159
in the game.

129
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:05,264
It might also be that I lack the skills to control my impulses or to label my emotions.

130
00:11:07,105 --> 00:11:11,988
And in the case of Star Stable, which I think is true for many online games, we could see

131
00:11:12,108 --> 00:11:15,711
that players were acting out of rage when they lost a race.

132
00:11:16,934 --> 00:11:21,116
Or perhaps they spotted bullying in a chat, but they were too afraid to act,

133
00:11:21,536 --> 00:11:26,919
and they might even continue and tag along with the friends in the behavior that they could see.

134
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,861
We could also see that players felt disappointed about a recent release,

135
00:11:33,021 --> 00:11:34,862
and they acted out in that frustration.

136
00:11:37,181 --> 00:11:42,822
So with this knowledge and the awareness of what situation a player might find him or

137
00:11:42,862 --> 00:11:48,723
herself in when they're acting in their anger, we developed a three-step approach that is

138
00:11:48,783 --> 00:11:55,424
based on a research-based method called non-violent communication. And we divided it into three

139
00:11:55,484 --> 00:12:01,445
steps where the first one is to help the player identify his or her feelings and the situation

140
00:12:01,505 --> 00:12:03,526
that we would like that person to change.

141
00:12:04,707 --> 00:12:07,730
So we talk about self-awareness and self-management.

142
00:12:08,691 --> 00:12:11,193
The second step is to help the player understand

143
00:12:11,273 --> 00:12:14,396
how the hurtful behavior is causing others to feel.

144
00:12:14,956 --> 00:12:16,137
So social awareness.

145
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:20,781
And then we wanted to encourage a more positive behavior

146
00:12:20,921 --> 00:12:25,285
by giving an example of what that player could do.

147
00:12:25,805 --> 00:12:27,907
So talking about relationship building.

148
00:12:29,628 --> 00:12:30,970
And in the case of Star Stable,

149
00:12:31,090 --> 00:12:33,272
this is the message that we ended up using.

150
00:12:34,232 --> 00:12:38,273
So first you see, hey, it seems you sent an unkind message.

151
00:12:38,833 --> 00:12:41,574
We're helping the player identify the behavior

152
00:12:41,614 --> 00:12:44,775
that we would like to change, but without judging.

153
00:12:46,255 --> 00:12:48,576
Secondly, stop and think, how would you feel

154
00:12:48,776 --> 00:12:50,037
if someone said that to you?

155
00:12:50,777 --> 00:12:54,938
So giving the player the opportunity to experience empathy

156
00:12:55,058 --> 00:12:59,179
and put themselves in the shoes of another player's feet.

157
00:13:00,473 --> 00:13:04,755
And then third, remember, being a good friend can also get you lots of new friends.

158
00:13:05,036 --> 00:13:06,877
So why would I change my behavior?

159
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:09,658
Well, if I can get new friends, that sounds pretty good.

160
00:13:11,299 --> 00:13:16,943
Now the message would not be effective if we couldn't identify the right moments to

161
00:13:16,983 --> 00:13:17,623
deliver this.

162
00:13:18,203 --> 00:13:23,486
And in order to do so, we needed the powerful technology that Autoloo could contribute with.

163
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:30,632
So, as Polina mentioned, we now have the message, right?

164
00:13:30,712 --> 00:13:32,814
So we needed to know when to trigger it,

165
00:13:33,294 --> 00:13:36,216
and also how do we actually measure this?

166
00:13:36,336 --> 00:13:38,837
How do we measure that it's effective at all?

167
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:44,721
So what we used was something called transformer models,

168
00:13:45,441 --> 00:13:48,583
and to give a very simple explanation of this,

169
00:13:48,883 --> 00:13:52,025
imagine an AI model that ingests the entire Wikipedia.

170
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:56,208
and then through that learns language and for example,

171
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,130
cultural contexts and things like this.

172
00:14:00,211 --> 00:14:01,772
And that's something we use as a base.

173
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:04,755
But I'll also show you how this can go wrong

174
00:14:05,055 --> 00:14:07,577
with this cutting edge AI technology.

175
00:14:08,037 --> 00:14:09,639
So I've put this sentence here,

176
00:14:10,739 --> 00:14:12,521
which you can see, Winfield, today you suck,

177
00:14:12,781 --> 00:14:14,682
can see you're only 10, right?

178
00:14:14,783 --> 00:14:16,224
And all of you have read this here

179
00:14:16,264 --> 00:14:17,485
and probably made up your mind

180
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,546
in terms of what this actually means.

181
00:14:21,107 --> 00:14:21,328
Now.

182
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:29,034
if we used an out of the box transformer model that would be coming from uh say it read the

183
00:14:29,054 --> 00:14:35,278
entire Wikipedia, it might interpret this as being, Winful being a person who is ten years

184
00:14:35,398 --> 00:14:41,861
old. Now in the context of star stable, this would be very wrong. Winful is actually a

185
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:47,765
horse breed and ten is most likely referring to the level of the horse in this case.

186
00:14:48,651 --> 00:14:54,032
Now, the way we kind of made sure that our AI model was adapted to Star Stable was that

187
00:14:54,072 --> 00:14:57,473
we let it ingest data from Star Stable, from the community.

188
00:14:57,533 --> 00:15:04,735
So just like, say, a community manager builds up this intuition of how people communicate

189
00:15:04,755 --> 00:15:09,176
in the game, the AI model was learning those different associations and connotations.

190
00:15:09,857 --> 00:15:12,618
So when we get to the last layer where we're actually saying,

191
00:15:13,238 --> 00:15:17,040
what is hurtful behavior towards another user,

192
00:15:17,661 --> 00:15:19,922
the AI model that was fine-tuned to Star Stable

193
00:15:19,942 --> 00:15:22,143
would know that, okay, here you're actually

194
00:15:22,163 --> 00:15:24,484
writing to your own horse in this case,

195
00:15:25,585 --> 00:15:27,205
not another user, so maybe we shouldn't

196
00:15:27,225 --> 00:15:28,166
be triggering the message.

197
00:15:28,646 --> 00:15:31,768
However, if we'd used a kind of out-of-the-box AI model,

198
00:15:32,048 --> 00:15:34,149
it probably would have triggered the message in this case.

199
00:15:34,669 --> 00:15:38,517
So you can see there, even with this cutting edge AI technology, we have to be wary of

200
00:15:39,058 --> 00:15:39,939
what can go wrong.

201
00:15:40,681 --> 00:15:46,772
And this is still very effective compared to, say, keyword filters, but it has its caveats

202
00:15:46,852 --> 00:15:47,113
as well.

203
00:15:48,487 --> 00:15:51,870
Now, we had this so we knew when to trigger the message,

204
00:15:52,511 --> 00:15:54,053
and as Jane was mentioning,

205
00:15:54,653 --> 00:15:57,156
we needed a way to kind of measure this.

206
00:15:57,316 --> 00:16:00,540
And I'm sure with COVID being around,

207
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:03,243
we're all somewhat familiar with kind of clinical trials

208
00:16:03,303 --> 00:16:03,983
and how they work.

209
00:16:04,684 --> 00:16:07,167
And you could say we used a similar approach here.

210
00:16:07,227 --> 00:16:09,790
So we had a treatment and a control group.

211
00:16:10,771 --> 00:16:13,074
Now, there were some considerations we had to make here.

212
00:16:13,134 --> 00:16:15,276
So the treatment group would get the message triggered

213
00:16:15,316 --> 00:16:17,398
when they were writing something hurtful to another user.

214
00:16:17,959 --> 00:16:19,741
The control group would not get the message.

215
00:16:20,281 --> 00:16:24,366
However, StarStable already had some built-in safety features

216
00:16:24,726 --> 00:16:26,508
so that if you were writing something hurtful

217
00:16:26,548 --> 00:16:29,211
to another user, it would kind of get blocked out.

218
00:16:29,952 --> 00:16:32,875
And we didn't remove that feature for the control group.

219
00:16:32,895 --> 00:16:36,498
So both groups would actually still have their messages removed.

220
00:16:36,598 --> 00:16:41,663
And the reason why we did that was to make sure that we're not exposing other users to

221
00:16:41,723 --> 00:16:46,448
more kind of a negative experience that they wouldn't have had otherwise.

222
00:16:47,429 --> 00:16:51,451
And those are some of the considerations you need to kind of make when you're trying out

223
00:16:51,491 --> 00:16:52,291
these type of things.

224
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:58,535
Another thing that we did was also making sure that we could measure this in real time

225
00:16:58,695 --> 00:16:59,956
as the data was flowing in.

226
00:17:00,556 --> 00:17:04,798
Because our hypothesis was that this would have a positive impact.

227
00:17:05,279 --> 00:17:07,220
However, once out in the wild,

228
00:17:07,521 --> 00:17:09,562
things can change pretty dramatically

229
00:17:09,602 --> 00:17:12,625
and we might experience a really adverse reaction to this.

230
00:17:12,906 --> 00:17:15,548
So we wanted to know that we could kind of hit a kill switch

231
00:17:15,648 --> 00:17:16,949
if something went really wrong

232
00:17:17,490 --> 00:17:19,492
or if things look really positive,

233
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,954
we could actually roll this out even quicker

234
00:17:21,994 --> 00:17:23,375
and stop the actual test.

235
00:17:24,671 --> 00:17:31,216
Now, we did this in conjunction with the community team, so we were looking at the quantitative

236
00:17:31,256 --> 00:17:35,799
data that was coming in to us in a live manner, but we were also listening to the community

237
00:17:35,819 --> 00:17:40,503
team that was getting the qualitative data coming in from the actual community, so seeing

238
00:17:40,523 --> 00:17:44,085
if there was any feedback coming in there. And I think it's very important to look at

239
00:17:44,265 --> 00:17:47,928
both those aspects as you're trying to do something like this, and you also have to

240
00:17:47,968 --> 00:17:52,691
be very wary of, you know, what potentially could go wrong when you're...

241
00:17:53,172 --> 00:17:55,053
running this type of test.

242
00:17:55,393 --> 00:17:57,515
But through doing this, we could actually measure

243
00:17:57,755 --> 00:17:59,116
how effective this message was.

244
00:17:59,316 --> 00:18:01,097
And I'm gonna hand it back over to Jane now

245
00:18:01,117 --> 00:18:03,199
to kind of talk about the results that we saw.

246
00:18:09,483 --> 00:18:10,864
So did we succeed?

247
00:18:11,384 --> 00:18:13,846
And what was the conclusion after six weeks?

248
00:18:14,887 --> 00:18:17,829
The first week, we did not see any significant differences

249
00:18:17,949 --> 00:18:19,210
between the two user groups.

250
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:21,431
But as the pilot proceeded, that would change.

251
00:18:22,829 --> 00:18:35,919
Already after four weeks, we could see a significant difference between the two groups, which made us 99% confident that the message we displayed for the players was reducing the number of harmful messages in the control group.

252
00:18:37,020 --> 00:18:46,367
Interesting as well, no players contacted our player support during the course of the pilot with other questions or complaints, so they accepted the pilot.

253
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:52,292
But we did see some interesting behavior in the chat with our players' first discovery in the pop-up.

254
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:58,351
Not all, but some will try to trigger it again, most likely as a challenge to see where the

255
00:18:58,391 --> 00:19:01,873
boundary goes before getting a ban or some other punishment.

256
00:19:02,773 --> 00:19:05,035
So it could look like this, as we see on the screen.

257
00:19:06,095 --> 00:19:12,619
In the first session, same player, user A, first say something harmful to another player,

258
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:13,940
hope you get hit by the bus.

259
00:19:14,441 --> 00:19:16,762
And then, oh, I get some warnings.

260
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:21,965
And then self-reflecting, how many warnings do you need before you get a chat ban?

261
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:33,365
and session two, I want another one, ah noob, and then got it. So, uh, quite interesting

262
00:19:33,485 --> 00:19:35,068
behavior from, from our players.

263
00:19:44,608 --> 00:19:47,290
So with the two different groups, treatment and control,

264
00:19:47,650 --> 00:19:50,612
the length of the pilot, and the amount of chat messages

265
00:19:50,812 --> 00:19:54,275
sent during this period, we can with 98% confidence

266
00:19:54,335 --> 00:20:00,700
say that we did reduce 5% of harmful messages

267
00:20:01,020 --> 00:20:02,701
among our players in the UK.

268
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:05,423
Maybe it doesn't sound that much,

269
00:20:05,643 --> 00:20:08,505
but 5% translated into actual messages

270
00:20:09,066 --> 00:20:13,569
are more than 800 negative interactions not being sent.

271
00:20:15,764 --> 00:20:22,952
And that done without policing, no banning, and instead encourage our players to stop, think, and

272
00:20:22,992 --> 00:20:32,404
do what a nice friend does. So I would say, yes, we did succeed. So what's next? In the game, we

273
00:20:32,424 --> 00:20:34,667
will see the Dark Riders take entrance.

274
00:20:35,561 --> 00:20:39,542
But with the pilot, where do we want to go from here?

275
00:20:40,603 --> 00:20:42,843
After the pilot was done, we're quite sure

276
00:20:42,923 --> 00:20:45,464
that this is one of the missing pieces in our strategy

277
00:20:45,504 --> 00:20:47,965
to create a friendly environment in our game.

278
00:20:48,925 --> 00:20:51,266
In our overall vision, there are three parts

279
00:20:51,306 --> 00:20:53,047
that we call the moderation puzzle.

280
00:20:54,347 --> 00:20:56,208
There are the rules and regulation element

281
00:20:56,368 --> 00:20:59,169
that ensure things that absolutely should not

282
00:20:59,229 --> 00:21:01,189
be in the chat are not part of the chat.

283
00:21:02,310 --> 00:21:03,890
There's the self-moderation piece.

284
00:21:04,330 --> 00:21:08,011
which players alert us when there's something going on in the chat.

285
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:13,814
And then there's the third part about encourage positive behavior in-game,

286
00:21:14,454 --> 00:21:17,075
which the pilots showed was possible.

287
00:21:17,996 --> 00:21:20,937
So right now we are preparing to set up a long-term structure

288
00:21:21,557 --> 00:21:24,559
for this to be a permanent part of our in-game communication.

289
00:21:25,199 --> 00:21:27,980
We have the vision and we do have the knowledge now.

290
00:21:30,341 --> 00:21:30,581
So

291
00:21:32,464 --> 00:21:38,087
Coming to the end, some key takeaways, and I would say have a strong vision,

292
00:21:39,788 --> 00:21:43,431
makes sort of the key, and also a strong team.

293
00:21:43,931 --> 00:21:47,393
And then I include both the internal team and, of course,

294
00:21:47,574 --> 00:21:51,936
good partners that can enable where you don't have the resources.

295
00:21:54,533 --> 00:21:59,295
Yes, and think about how you can support and build skills on the players' terms.

296
00:21:59,976 --> 00:22:04,198
So you created the game, but your players created their community.

297
00:22:04,738 --> 00:22:08,060
So how can you, in your game, create guidance

298
00:22:08,781 --> 00:22:13,023
and help players behave in a more positive way without judging?

299
00:22:15,905 --> 00:22:16,925
And last but not least...

300
00:22:18,873 --> 00:22:21,635
If you have the right circumstances the right environment,

301
00:22:22,276 --> 00:22:24,458
nice people in online game do exist.

302
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:30,203
So that was the end, so I think we are in the Q and A.

303
00:22:42,773 --> 00:22:44,455
Barely. I don't know if the. It's on.

304
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:46,640
Hello.

305
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:47,321
Hello.

306
00:22:47,661 --> 00:22:51,724
I love the three-point research kind of framework that you had.

307
00:22:52,744 --> 00:22:55,887
I noticed the phrasing, the first sentence.

308
00:22:56,567 --> 00:22:58,749
I noticed you sent in a harmful message.

309
00:22:59,850 --> 00:23:01,751
I thought of the first point was more

310
00:23:01,771 --> 00:23:03,472
of like self-awareness of an emotion.

311
00:23:03,992 --> 00:23:05,634
So I know it's kind of hard to identify

312
00:23:05,674 --> 00:23:06,414
what they're going through.

313
00:23:07,035 --> 00:23:10,077
Any kind of thought about what that first sentence should

314
00:23:10,117 --> 00:23:15,000
be, kind of like to fully get at that self-awareness framework?

315
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:23,745
Yes, so we had a couple of ideas on how we can use that research-based method and there

316
00:23:23,885 --> 00:23:26,786
are A-B testings that we hope we can do.

317
00:23:26,806 --> 00:23:33,349
And one way could have been to say, hey, it seems that you've sent an unkind message.

318
00:23:33,849 --> 00:23:39,152
Take a moment to stop and think how are you feeling in this moment and then go on and

319
00:23:39,212 --> 00:23:40,493
say, okay, well.

320
00:23:41,513 --> 00:23:46,096
built the empathy skills, how would you feel if someone said this to you? What

321
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:52,039
can be a little bit risky when talking about very strong emotions or big

322
00:23:52,079 --> 00:23:58,003
emotions is that we couldn't in that moment offer also a skill building to

323
00:23:58,083 --> 00:24:03,166
how to deal with that emotion. So we decided to focus on the change in

324
00:24:03,206 --> 00:24:03,766
behavior.

325
00:24:04,527 --> 00:24:08,872
and focus a little bit more on the social awareness and the relationship skill building,

326
00:24:09,313 --> 00:24:13,859
although I'm sure there are moments where we could have had a stronger focus on the self-awareness instead.

327
00:24:13,879 --> 00:24:15,420
Cool, that makes sense. Thanks.

328
00:24:15,441 --> 00:24:15,701
Thank you.

329
00:24:21,562 --> 00:24:26,949
Hello, can you talk a little bit about whether or not that 5% reduction was specific to certain

330
00:24:26,989 --> 00:24:32,016
players and you saw an actual reform in some of those player behaviors over time or was

331
00:24:32,056 --> 00:24:36,583
this just generically across the board regardless of specific player behavior?

332
00:24:37,942 --> 00:24:40,223
We actually looked at this on aggregate

333
00:24:40,263 --> 00:24:42,704
across the two different groups.

334
00:24:42,824 --> 00:24:46,806
What is interesting, what we saw was the most,

335
00:24:46,886 --> 00:24:50,447
so you would have a small, majority of players,

336
00:24:50,547 --> 00:24:53,129
you kind of have this one humped camel.

337
00:24:53,329 --> 00:24:57,210
Majority of players might send a couple of harmful messages,

338
00:24:57,330 --> 00:24:59,511
one harmful message, and then you would have kind of like,

339
00:25:00,692 --> 00:25:03,213
a few players that were sending a lot more.

340
00:25:03,353 --> 00:25:06,654
What we saw was that this group actually did not reform.

341
00:25:07,695 --> 00:25:09,776
did not change behavior overall.

342
00:25:09,796 --> 00:25:16,199
You kind of had the same kind of camel shape afterwards.

343
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:18,361
Those kind of insights kind of tell you that,

344
00:25:18,501 --> 00:25:20,942
okay, maybe we need another approach with this group.

345
00:25:21,002 --> 00:25:23,123
You know, okay, on aggregate,

346
00:25:23,163 --> 00:25:24,784
we are actually able to change some of the behavior,

347
00:25:24,824 --> 00:25:26,145
but for this group,

348
00:25:26,265 --> 00:25:28,746
we might need some other type of intervention there as well,

349
00:25:28,766 --> 00:25:32,208
which I think is important since not every player

350
00:25:32,248 --> 00:25:34,389
is going to be the same and respond the same

351
00:25:34,449 --> 00:25:36,610
to this type of messaging.

352
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:40,815
And then as a follow-up, were there any long-term changes

353
00:25:40,875 --> 00:25:42,676
that you observed in player behavior

354
00:25:42,696 --> 00:25:45,559
that could be linked to this type of model?

355
00:25:45,579 --> 00:25:46,901
Like, for example, were players

356
00:25:46,941 --> 00:25:49,103
who were consistently seeing this warning

357
00:25:49,604 --> 00:25:51,285
less likely to engage in the future,

358
00:25:52,266 --> 00:25:53,688
or was there no change in behavior?

359
00:25:55,954 --> 00:26:00,058
So we ran this over a six week period and what we saw during that period was that

360
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:05,444
you would have, are you referring now to the specific like harmful messaging or?

361
00:26:05,464 --> 00:26:08,086
I mean more in terms of like retention of players.

362
00:26:08,106 --> 00:26:12,190
Oh we didn't look at the actual retention of players in this case, we were more

363
00:26:12,451 --> 00:26:16,615
specifically looking at the harmful behavior towards other players.

364
00:26:17,596 --> 00:26:17,876
Thank you.

365
00:26:21,300 --> 00:26:36,601
Hello, first I want to say that I really like the methodology you guys use and this is the perfect population to use it on like a young audience that they're already learning social skills. How did you guys measure success of this methodology?

366
00:26:39,915 --> 00:26:41,936
I guess that's where we wanted to have

367
00:26:41,976 --> 00:26:43,797
this more quantitative measure,

368
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,498
to actually see that there is a reduction.

369
00:26:46,558 --> 00:26:50,339
And I'm speaking a bit from my personal experience,

370
00:26:50,379 --> 00:26:52,560
coming from Google and trust and safety.

371
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:56,701
And it's a lot of the time you're trying to mitigate risk

372
00:26:56,801 --> 00:26:59,082
and kind of reduce harmful behavior.

373
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:00,562
And it's been difficult to measure.

374
00:27:00,602 --> 00:27:03,363
I think one area here, which we can all agree on

375
00:27:03,423 --> 00:27:06,865
is like, how do we see that we have some success?

376
00:27:06,905 --> 00:27:08,545
And that's why we kind of did this more.

377
00:27:09,405 --> 00:27:12,886
had this more clinical approach in terms of A-B testing to actually be able to

378
00:27:12,946 --> 00:27:17,007
quantitatively measure that okay messages from this specific group were

379
00:27:17,027 --> 00:27:20,008
going down in terms of the harmful messages.

380
00:27:20,028 --> 00:27:26,349
Yeah and I can add to that as a I have a very strong vision that

381
00:27:26,929 --> 00:27:33,351
as long as one child or teen or player is not being presented with this hurtful

382
00:27:33,911 --> 00:27:36,452
message that's a success for me personally.

383
00:27:37,032 --> 00:27:42,233
And then obviously there are things that could be tested in terms of optimizing things and

384
00:27:43,134 --> 00:27:47,315
maybe, as we talked about, having another message for certain players, etc.

385
00:27:47,375 --> 00:27:54,757
But I think for our pilot, the success was to actually see a decrease in harmful messages.

386
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:56,277
Thank you.

387
00:27:56,598 --> 00:27:57,838
I can continue on that as well.

388
00:27:58,738 --> 00:28:01,479
So yes, that was the goal in itself.

389
00:28:01,559 --> 00:28:03,280
We could have done a lot of other sort of...

390
00:28:04,181 --> 00:28:08,106
metrics to look up on, but we'd like to keep it simple.

391
00:28:08,546 --> 00:28:10,830
We started to talk about a lot of messaging trees

392
00:28:11,210 --> 00:28:13,734
and it started to become complex,

393
00:28:14,074 --> 00:28:17,699
but we said let's try it, rather than to get it perfect.

394
00:28:19,076 --> 00:28:23,700
I think one last thing to add to this is that the positive impact, I think, from this is

395
00:28:23,740 --> 00:28:30,144
that what we present here today, we hope that many of you in here, if you are a developer

396
00:28:30,585 --> 00:28:33,787
or you're working with community management, you can go back to your teams and you can

397
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:36,329
show, hey, this actually works.

398
00:28:36,369 --> 00:28:41,293
There's hard numbers here that can show that this actually can have a positive impact on

399
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:41,793
your players.

400
00:28:43,234 --> 00:28:43,554
Thank you.

401
00:28:46,737 --> 00:28:47,818
I think there's the last question.

402
00:28:49,695 --> 00:28:54,618
OK. Thank you. Very interesting pilot.

403
00:28:55,559 --> 00:29:02,983
So, a lot of the neuroscience studies show that it's extremely difficult to change behavior without awareness first.

404
00:29:03,864 --> 00:29:05,005
And also...

405
00:29:05,965 --> 00:29:09,708
it's much more difficult to get awareness when you are in the heat

406
00:29:10,188 --> 00:29:15,511
of the emotion and the action. So have you been thinking of any like

407
00:29:15,631 --> 00:29:19,413
preventive or like reinforcing positive experiences

408
00:29:19,533 --> 00:29:24,236
even before like they deteriorate or any way to enhance like the trust?

409
00:29:25,277 --> 00:29:31,101
you know, relationships, strong trusting relationship also helps to reduce this kind of behavior.

410
00:29:32,242 --> 00:29:36,685
So it's like you almost try to tackle like the most difficult aspect, but

411
00:29:37,205 --> 00:29:42,489
like what could you do to build up to kind of, you know, reduce in advance?

412
00:29:44,839 --> 00:29:51,060
What we do have in the game as well is ambassadors that are in the game and that do talk to our players

413
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:54,041
and they also try to be nice friends and role models.

414
00:29:54,521 --> 00:29:57,922
So I think that is some type of awareness and we do have guidelines.

415
00:29:58,482 --> 00:30:01,563
And the game in itself stands for kindness.

416
00:30:02,663 --> 00:30:06,604
We have one of our values is kindness is a superpower.

417
00:30:07,864 --> 00:30:13,625
So we talk a lot about sort of friendship, kindness and what that can enable.

418
00:30:14,165 --> 00:30:20,008
It's not just being sort of kind, it is a superpower and what does it entail.

419
00:30:20,108 --> 00:30:24,490
So I think that is spring to some awareness, if that was what you meant.

420
00:30:26,751 --> 00:30:29,012
Yeah, partly. It's also like...

421
00:30:31,093 --> 00:30:34,974
You don't want to suppress negative emotions neither.

422
00:30:35,414 --> 00:30:38,415
So it's more like learning how to deal with them,

423
00:30:38,715 --> 00:30:39,835
also when they arise.

424
00:30:40,455 --> 00:30:43,096
But learning to do that in the heat of the emotion

425
00:30:43,176 --> 00:30:44,056
is super hard.

426
00:30:44,676 --> 00:30:47,857
So it's, yeah, that's kind of what I meant.

427
00:30:48,057 --> 00:30:54,558
Like, how do they learn to deal with negative emotions

428
00:30:54,578 --> 00:30:56,358
before they lash out?

429
00:30:56,979 --> 00:31:03,143
So I think your question is around emotional regulation and what can we do to promote that in a game.

430
00:31:03,223 --> 00:31:08,707
And of course there are many ways such as if it's losing a race for instance,

431
00:31:09,207 --> 00:31:15,612
you could have encouraging friends that say, oh next time we'll do it or like you still did a

432
00:31:15,652 --> 00:31:21,876
great race and just as we would in a real life setting with a lack of a better word.

433
00:31:22,637 --> 00:31:28,122
And I think in terms of lashing out and behaving perhaps in a hurtful way,

434
00:31:28,722 --> 00:31:35,888
as I said in this pilot, we decided to focus on sort of changing a behavior

435
00:31:35,968 --> 00:31:37,550
and how to build the relationships,

436
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:41,713
but I'm very curious to see what we can do also with emotional regulation.

437
00:31:42,334 --> 00:31:44,936
And I think that question will be more around...

438
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:48,599
not minimizing the freedom of a player

439
00:31:48,619 --> 00:31:52,022
and not becoming too educational

440
00:31:52,222 --> 00:31:57,086
or being almost their psychologist in that sense.

441
00:31:57,226 --> 00:31:59,949
So it's a tough question

442
00:32:00,109 --> 00:32:03,912
and I hope that it's something that we can work with in the future.

443
00:32:03,932 --> 00:32:05,914
Great, thank you.

444
00:32:06,794 --> 00:32:08,236
And thank you so much for listening.

445
00:32:08,756 --> 00:32:09,096
Thank you.
