00:00:11,369 --> 00:00:12,049
Hello and welcome.

2
00:00:12,349 --> 00:00:16,710
The title of my talk is Knocking on Death's Door, Designing a New Bunker for Horizon Forbidden

3
00:00:16,730 --> 00:00:17,010
West.

4
00:00:18,151 --> 00:00:20,352
I'm Blake Rubichet, Senior Quest Designer at Guerrilla.

5
00:00:20,952 --> 00:00:24,273
I joined Guerrilla about seven years ago during the production of Horizon Zero Dawn.

6
00:00:24,996 --> 00:00:28,377
On Zero Dawn, I designed the Grave Horde and the Zero Dawn Project Bunker,

7
00:00:28,457 --> 00:00:30,537
which is part of the Deep Secrets of the Earth quest.

8
00:00:30,738 --> 00:00:34,799
So my specialty is in big, narratively driven, mostly linear interior spaces.

9
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,660
I've been a designer on Horizon for the West through the entire production process.

10
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,141
I can honestly say that it's been one of the most amazing and challenging projects

11
00:00:43,161 --> 00:00:44,521
I've ever tackled as a designer.

12
00:00:45,782 --> 00:00:46,762
So what is this talk about?

13
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:49,651
This talk is about a quest that I worked on

14
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:52,353
through the entire development of Horizon Forbidden West.

15
00:00:53,214 --> 00:00:54,615
Specifically, I'm going to talk about

16
00:00:54,875 --> 00:00:56,976
the level and quest design of the bunker in this quest.

17
00:00:57,817 --> 00:00:59,338
I designed seven quests during the development

18
00:00:59,358 --> 00:01:01,319
of Horizon Forbidden West, but it's no lie to say

19
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,121
that I probably spent more person hours working on this quest

20
00:01:04,301 --> 00:01:05,702
than several of the others combined,

21
00:01:06,102 --> 00:01:07,904
and indeed more than any other piece of content

22
00:01:07,944 --> 00:01:09,285
I've worked on in any game.

23
00:01:10,184 --> 00:01:12,285
I want to give you all as broad a picture as I can

24
00:01:12,445 --> 00:01:14,467
of the development of this large and complex quest,

25
00:01:14,547 --> 00:01:16,448
and in doing so, also show you a little bit

26
00:01:16,488 --> 00:01:18,369
of our quest and level design process.

27
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:21,131
If you've seen my previous GDC talk,

28
00:01:21,551 --> 00:01:22,932
this talk is a little bit of a follow-up,

29
00:01:22,952 --> 00:01:24,292
a little bit of a sequel to that talk,

30
00:01:24,653 --> 00:01:25,973
but you don't need to have watched that talk

31
00:01:25,993 --> 00:01:27,014
to appreciate this one at all.

32
00:01:31,132 --> 00:01:33,334
In my previous talk, Balancing Action in RPG

33
00:01:33,374 --> 00:01:34,816
and Horizon Zero Dawn's Quests,

34
00:01:35,557 --> 00:01:37,518
I talked about my process and my learnings

35
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:39,360
in the creation of the Bunker of the Grave Horde.

36
00:01:39,721 --> 00:01:41,723
This is a space where Aloy came face-to-face

37
00:01:41,743 --> 00:01:43,745
with the realities of war in the time of the Old Ones.

38
00:01:45,112 --> 00:01:47,173
For Forbidden West we wanted to build on some of the things

39
00:01:47,213 --> 00:01:48,994
that we did well in Zero Dawn's bunkers.

40
00:01:49,634 --> 00:01:52,455
For instance, we wanted to focus on building

41
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:54,756
story-rich environments with unique puzzles,

42
00:01:55,357 --> 00:01:57,417
but we also wanted to deemphasize some of the parts

43
00:01:57,558 --> 00:01:59,518
of the first game's bunkers that were problematic,

44
00:01:59,678 --> 00:02:01,399
in particular combat against humanoids

45
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:04,000
and the large cost in terms of art

46
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:05,141
and lighting they represented.

47
00:02:05,681 --> 00:02:07,722
As you'll discover, we were sometimes more,

48
00:02:07,782 --> 00:02:09,763
sometimes less successful in respect to these goals.

49
00:02:11,322 --> 00:02:14,523
Took me four years and counting to build this quest.

50
00:02:15,303 --> 00:02:17,224
I've broken that timeline down into six phases

51
00:02:17,264 --> 00:02:18,604
and I'm gonna talk you through each one,

52
00:02:18,704 --> 00:02:20,985
giving you a sense of what the level looked like in each

53
00:02:21,205 --> 00:02:22,325
and the challenges we faced.

54
00:02:23,046 --> 00:02:24,686
Starting with the beginning of the beginning,

55
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:26,127
we'll talk about production,

56
00:02:26,587 --> 00:02:28,167
pre-production and paper prototyping.

57
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:30,488
In skeleton quest, we'll talk about

58
00:02:30,508 --> 00:02:31,988
the block meshing of the level.

59
00:02:32,869 --> 00:02:34,149
In the first playable, we'll talk about

60
00:02:34,189 --> 00:02:36,069
getting the quest ready for the first play tests.

61
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:38,621
In iteration and parallel development,

62
00:02:38,681 --> 00:02:40,682
I'll talk about adding value through iteration

63
00:02:40,802 --> 00:02:42,343
and integrating the work of other teams.

64
00:02:43,204 --> 00:02:45,565
In a time of great change, we'll talk a bit

65
00:02:45,605 --> 00:02:48,167
about the pandemic and work from home and rework.

66
00:02:48,967 --> 00:02:51,289
And lastly, in finishing touches, we'll talk about polish.

67
00:02:53,110 --> 00:02:55,552
So let's start with the beginning of the beginning.

68
00:02:56,652 --> 00:02:58,634
This is equivalent to pre-production of this quest,

69
00:02:58,994 --> 00:03:00,075
but also encompasses a bit

70
00:03:00,115 --> 00:03:01,916
of the overall project pre-production.

71
00:03:03,429 --> 00:03:05,670
During the pre-production of Horizon Zero Dawn's quest,

72
00:03:05,751 --> 00:03:07,572
the entire company gathered into our canteen

73
00:03:07,592 --> 00:03:09,093
for a meeting we called Story Time

74
00:03:10,173 --> 00:03:11,154
with the narrative director.

75
00:03:11,714 --> 00:03:13,555
In this meeting, we were told the entire main story

76
00:03:13,575 --> 00:03:15,276
of Horizon Forbidden West in one go.

77
00:03:16,017 --> 00:03:17,918
Sometime after that meeting, I was assigned

78
00:03:17,958 --> 00:03:21,500
to create a section or a part of that overarching narrative

79
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,482
and that became known as the quest Death's Door.

80
00:03:26,048 --> 00:03:26,968
As part of that assignment,

81
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,749
I received a narrative summary of the quest.

82
00:03:29,230 --> 00:03:31,131
This is a document generated by the writer

83
00:03:31,251 --> 00:03:32,652
after a quest pitch is agreed to.

84
00:03:33,212 --> 00:03:34,313
With a main quest like this,

85
00:03:34,493 --> 00:03:36,634
there have already been lead and director level meetings

86
00:03:36,934 --> 00:03:38,575
to discuss the major goals, gameplay,

87
00:03:38,655 --> 00:03:39,596
and story of the quest.

88
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:41,937
Starting from the narrative summary,

89
00:03:42,017 --> 00:03:43,318
I break down the steps of the quest

90
00:03:43,358 --> 00:03:45,860
into the early beat sheet or design document.

91
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:48,521
During the process, I may add, change,

92
00:03:48,901 --> 00:03:51,203
or tweak the events spelled out in the narrative summary

93
00:03:51,623 --> 00:03:53,224
and add gameplay to clarify goals

94
00:03:53,304 --> 00:03:55,065
with the approval of leads and direction.

95
00:03:56,142 --> 00:03:58,084
Once that early design doc beat sheet is approved,

96
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,605
I start paper prototyping.

97
00:04:04,570 --> 00:04:05,991
This is a good time to mention that I'm gonna try

98
00:04:06,031 --> 00:04:07,913
to keep this talk as spoiler light as I can,

99
00:04:09,635 --> 00:04:11,096
but let me give you a little bit of context.

100
00:04:11,716 --> 00:04:13,798
In this quest, Aloy goes to an old world bunker

101
00:04:13,918 --> 00:04:15,300
in search of a backup of Gaia,

102
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:17,962
the AI designed to control the terraforming process of Earth.

103
00:04:18,403 --> 00:04:19,083
That's this bunker.

104
00:04:20,138 --> 00:04:24,460
As Aloy enters the facility, she enters a central hallway where she finds a blockage

105
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,681
caused by water and time.

106
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:29,182
She'll need to get around that blockage to reach an inner gene lock door.

107
00:04:29,963 --> 00:04:33,304
Nearby is an old communications center containing a puzzle to unlock a door.

108
00:04:34,355 --> 00:04:38,618
Past that locked door are stairs down to a flooded residential area that we swim through.

109
00:04:39,278 --> 00:04:42,581
At the end of that swim is an office and a way back up to level one.

110
00:04:43,241 --> 00:04:47,845
Back on level one, Aloy enters the second gene locked door and there's a space that

111
00:04:47,865 --> 00:04:51,667
we call the recluse chamber and there's a big cinematic there that I'm not going to

112
00:04:51,707 --> 00:04:52,068
talk about.

113
00:04:54,825 --> 00:04:57,087
And that's where some bad dudes show up.

114
00:04:57,407 --> 00:04:58,527
She finds what she's looking for.

115
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:02,429
The chamber is destroyed and she falls into a lower level,

116
00:05:03,290 --> 00:05:05,291
like an old sort of section of the bunker

117
00:05:05,331 --> 00:05:06,211
that's like a boiler room.

118
00:05:06,632 --> 00:05:08,993
And there she'll need to swim to escape

119
00:05:09,213 --> 00:05:11,374
while being pursued by some new machines called Spectres.

120
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:15,937
With that paper design in hand,

121
00:05:15,957 --> 00:05:18,618
we're ready to go to the skeleton quest phase,

122
00:05:18,678 --> 00:05:20,139
making the initial block out of the bunker.

123
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:22,700
But what is a skeleton quest?

124
00:05:23,765 --> 00:05:27,006
The simplest version of Skeleton Quest is one where the player can walk between various

125
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:31,068
locations on the map and there are simple pop-up text windows that appear and describe

126
00:05:31,108 --> 00:05:31,628
what happens.

127
00:05:32,328 --> 00:05:36,570
This helps give a sense of pacing and flow for quests that take place primarily in the

128
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:37,270
overworld map.

129
00:05:38,291 --> 00:05:42,192
A Skeleton Quest for a large interior like this is often more complicated, it's more

130
00:05:42,232 --> 00:05:44,733
work because you need to create a block mesh of the entire bunker.

131
00:05:45,783 --> 00:05:47,324
With a skeleton quest in the overworld,

132
00:05:47,364 --> 00:05:50,486
you often have some natural features to work with or around.

133
00:05:50,907 --> 00:05:52,948
Without that, it's important to have some look

134
00:05:53,188 --> 00:05:54,629
at the bunker early on,

135
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:57,410
some assistance from a team like Concept Art.

136
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:01,033
Here's an early piece from Concept Art

137
00:06:01,053 --> 00:06:03,094
suggesting the layers of construction of the bunker

138
00:06:03,454 --> 00:06:04,675
based on my paper designs.

139
00:06:05,175 --> 00:06:06,216
Notice the flooded floors

140
00:06:06,416 --> 00:06:07,997
and the older levels of the facility.

141
00:06:09,598 --> 00:06:11,079
They had this very interesting idea

142
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,200
to wrap the facility around the innermost area,

143
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:14,481
the recluse chamber.

144
00:06:15,912 --> 00:06:18,313
In that chamber, Aloy finds the Recluse Processor.

145
00:06:18,773 --> 00:06:20,234
This is a machine, potentially,

146
00:06:20,254 --> 00:06:23,036
that holds the copy of Gaia that Aloy's looking for,

147
00:06:23,356 --> 00:06:24,897
so it's her ultimate goal in this quest.

148
00:06:25,177 --> 00:06:27,799
But it also must serve a variety of other complex needs

149
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:29,840
that I'm gonna show you here in a moment.

150
00:06:31,481 --> 00:06:31,961
So here we go.

151
00:06:32,422 --> 00:06:34,002
This is the very earliest version

152
00:06:34,022 --> 00:06:36,024
of the playable skeleton quest that I had to share with you.

153
00:06:36,364 --> 00:06:37,925
I'm gonna show this to you in full,

154
00:06:38,705 --> 00:06:40,346
because I think it's gonna give you context

155
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,588
and more appreciation of how much development

156
00:06:42,608 --> 00:06:43,808
and change this quest goes through.

157
00:06:46,118 --> 00:06:47,638
So as this goes, I'm just gonna talk over it

158
00:06:47,718 --> 00:06:49,299
and explain a little bit about what you're seeing.

159
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,939
This is a security checkpoint that Aloy finds

160
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:52,860
at the entrance of the bunker,

161
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,820
and then here's the central hallway that I talked about

162
00:06:55,200 --> 00:06:57,721
with the blockage that prevents her from going directly

163
00:06:57,761 --> 00:06:59,801
to the second gene lock door, which is her goal.

164
00:07:01,242 --> 00:07:02,302
On either side of this chamber,

165
00:07:02,362 --> 00:07:03,743
there are some security offices

166
00:07:04,263 --> 00:07:06,923
and a large room here that is a communication center.

167
00:07:07,842 --> 00:07:09,943
In that communication center, there is a puzzle.

168
00:07:10,583 --> 00:07:12,844
We wanted to do some kind of new power puzzle,

169
00:07:12,904 --> 00:07:15,165
sort of like the multi-locks in Horizon Zero Dawn,

170
00:07:15,465 --> 00:07:16,445
but we wanted to do something new

171
00:07:16,465 --> 00:07:17,565
and we didn't know exactly what,

172
00:07:17,825 --> 00:07:19,506
so we put a placeholder in here,

173
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:21,527
something simple where you activate some consoles.

174
00:07:21,967 --> 00:07:23,607
When you do that, a cinematic starts,

175
00:07:23,907 --> 00:07:24,948
which you'll see here in a second.

176
00:07:28,623 --> 00:07:30,043
This is what cinematics look like first.

177
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:33,265
They look like a black placard with some text over it

178
00:07:33,285 --> 00:07:34,325
that explains what happens.

179
00:07:34,605 --> 00:07:36,186
That's how we block it out.

180
00:07:36,886 --> 00:07:37,946
Once you watch that cinematic,

181
00:07:38,307 --> 00:07:40,047
the door is powered and opens

182
00:07:40,087 --> 00:07:41,888
and you can proceed into the stairwell.

183
00:07:42,308 --> 00:07:46,069
The stairwell goes down into the flooded section,

184
00:07:46,089 --> 00:07:46,870
which you'll see in a moment.

185
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:49,351
There's a small little optional space here.

186
00:07:49,731 --> 00:07:51,712
If you can't tell, I was playing a lot of God of War 2016

187
00:07:52,092 --> 00:07:54,413
at the time, so there's a lot of these

188
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,794
like little hidden chest areas you can see from one space,

189
00:07:56,814 --> 00:07:57,994
but you can't reach till later.

190
00:07:59,335 --> 00:08:02,517
This is the flooded residential area or the lab area.

191
00:08:02,537 --> 00:08:03,898
You'll also hear me refer to it as.

192
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,760
Initially it was gonna be a residential area,

193
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,941
but we turned it into labs because that made more sense

194
00:08:07,961 --> 00:08:09,022
for the story of the area.

195
00:08:10,523 --> 00:08:12,924
So in Horizon Zero Dawn, we didn't have underwater swimming.

196
00:08:13,024 --> 00:08:14,305
You could kind of swim on the surface

197
00:08:14,385 --> 00:08:16,447
and then you could poke your head down beneath the water,

198
00:08:16,687 --> 00:08:18,788
but we didn't have true submersed swimming.

199
00:08:19,148 --> 00:08:20,869
And this is one of the first places where we wanted

200
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:22,751
to explore how that gameplay would feel.

201
00:08:23,031 --> 00:08:24,452
And especially we wanted to do something

202
00:08:24,492 --> 00:08:25,532
with an interior space.

203
00:08:26,513 --> 00:08:28,994
As a brief note, you saw her just use sort of a valve stem,

204
00:08:29,014 --> 00:08:31,514
a valve wheel, that's on a golden marker.

205
00:08:32,535 --> 00:08:34,295
That was my attempt to do something in this space

206
00:08:34,335 --> 00:08:36,675
initially where we had sort of a lock and key mechanic

207
00:08:36,775 --> 00:08:38,876
where you would need to find this valve wheel

208
00:08:38,916 --> 00:08:41,576
to plug it into a specific place that would open a door.

209
00:08:42,056 --> 00:08:43,877
So I gave you a little tiny example there

210
00:08:43,917 --> 00:08:45,797
to see that initially early on in the level.

211
00:08:46,217 --> 00:08:47,597
We also have some new elements in here

212
00:08:47,637 --> 00:08:49,378
that were new for us like shootable ladders,

213
00:08:49,758 --> 00:08:51,858
and you'll also see some very early versions

214
00:08:52,038 --> 00:08:53,518
of pullcaster interactions.

215
00:08:55,222 --> 00:08:57,545
So that chest, for example, that's a pullcaster interaction.

216
00:08:59,028 --> 00:09:01,150
These survived all the way to the ship product,

217
00:09:01,431 --> 00:09:03,033
but it was one of the very first things that we had

218
00:09:03,073 --> 00:09:04,735
that you could do with the pullcaster.

219
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:10,684
Also, fun note, you see that the pullcaster

220
00:09:10,704 --> 00:09:11,765
early on was also a weapon.

221
00:09:18,310 --> 00:09:20,412
So in the first version of this, it was a bit more puzzling.

222
00:09:20,792 --> 00:09:23,054
So like I said, we saw that golden marker

223
00:09:23,074 --> 00:09:24,255
that was next to that closed door,

224
00:09:24,595 --> 00:09:26,697
which the intention is to express

225
00:09:26,717 --> 00:09:29,119
that the player needs to find this valve wheel,

226
00:09:29,159 --> 00:09:30,800
which is the key that will unlock that door.

227
00:09:32,097 --> 00:09:34,578
There's a simple pull and shoot puzzle here,

228
00:09:35,118 --> 00:09:37,339
where you need to shoot a droppable ladder

229
00:09:37,379 --> 00:09:38,380
from this side of the room,

230
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,241
and then pull open a crawl space.

231
00:09:40,661 --> 00:09:42,261
If you were to just pull open the crawl space

232
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,162
and cross the other side,

233
00:09:43,542 --> 00:09:44,502
because of the way vents work,

234
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:47,103
you can't shoot from within the vent to drop that ladder.

235
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,524
So you would need to go backtrack.

236
00:09:53,186 --> 00:09:55,127
So here on this side, you'll find the valve wheel.

237
00:09:59,111 --> 00:10:00,872
You'll see some objects in the level

238
00:10:00,892 --> 00:10:03,012
that are brightly colored, like this golden archway here.

239
00:10:03,492 --> 00:10:07,134
There's also a pretty clear stripe on the floor

240
00:10:07,194 --> 00:10:08,934
in this next space, this blue stripe that you see.

241
00:10:09,614 --> 00:10:11,155
In the early block meshing process,

242
00:10:11,235 --> 00:10:14,396
we try to give things like very bright and vibrant colors

243
00:10:14,456 --> 00:10:15,797
to indicate their importance,

244
00:10:16,077 --> 00:10:18,017
to try to make things very clear.

245
00:10:18,798 --> 00:10:20,698
In this early version of the playable level,

246
00:10:20,738 --> 00:10:22,419
it's important that just everything is very clear

247
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:24,279
because there's not a lot of the tools

248
00:10:24,319 --> 00:10:25,940
we would have later on to express to you

249
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,880
that something is important.

250
00:10:28,119 --> 00:10:30,800
This was an attempt at doing kind of a tight swimming space,

251
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,022
something where you'd have to squeeze and crawl

252
00:10:33,062 --> 00:10:34,122
through a space underwater.

253
00:10:34,582 --> 00:10:36,003
That was something we thought we might do,

254
00:10:36,443 --> 00:10:38,684
and it turned out we didn't end up doing something like that.

255
00:10:38,744 --> 00:10:40,505
But you'll see how that space changed over time.

256
00:10:42,446 --> 00:10:44,687
Here within the swimscape, there is an office.

257
00:10:45,148 --> 00:10:47,569
This is Travis Tate's office, if you know Travis Tate.

258
00:10:48,469 --> 00:10:49,970
And the idea is that in this space,

259
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:52,091
we would find a story moment, another cinematic

260
00:10:52,151 --> 00:10:52,772
or a hologram.

261
00:10:54,417 --> 00:10:55,517
And by going through his office,

262
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:57,819
we'd be able to get into that hallway you just saw there,

263
00:10:58,540 --> 00:11:00,722
which will allow us to climb back up to level one,

264
00:11:00,882 --> 00:11:02,403
to the gene lock door, to our goal.

265
00:11:04,785 --> 00:11:07,207
So you might know in the final game, Fire Gleam.

266
00:11:07,647 --> 00:11:09,409
This is the very first version of Fire Gleam.

267
00:11:09,449 --> 00:11:11,850
We had these sort of placed C4 explosives.

268
00:11:15,573 --> 00:11:17,715
You'll see that iterate a few times through this as well.

269
00:11:30,490 --> 00:11:32,532
You'll see here that Aloy is self-talking.

270
00:11:32,672 --> 00:11:35,414
She says something like, comments that she should go up this ladder.

271
00:11:35,815 --> 00:11:38,377
That's how we handle self-talk in the beginning of development.

272
00:11:38,837 --> 00:11:43,181
They don't want us writing things that seem fictional or seem like actual dialogue because

273
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:45,463
that can get confusing as the state of development we're in.

274
00:11:46,027 --> 00:11:48,148
So what we do in these early versions of the quest

275
00:11:48,448 --> 00:11:50,530
is we put in self-tuck that's important

276
00:11:50,590 --> 00:11:53,052
for direction of the player that's kind of like that.

277
00:11:53,232 --> 00:11:55,794
Like Aloy comments that she should look up above her.

278
00:11:55,814 --> 00:11:58,256
Aloy comments that she should go down that hallway.

279
00:11:58,356 --> 00:11:58,876
Stuff like that.

280
00:12:01,058 --> 00:12:02,619
So now we enter the second gene lock door

281
00:12:02,659 --> 00:12:04,500
and we go into the recluse chamber.

282
00:12:07,222 --> 00:12:09,044
So this room holds the recluse processor

283
00:12:09,084 --> 00:12:09,944
I talked about earlier,

284
00:12:10,064 --> 00:12:11,566
which is this giant spider looking thingy.

285
00:12:12,562 --> 00:12:13,784
And the giant spider looking thingy

286
00:12:14,124 --> 00:12:15,947
is an AI testing apparatus.

287
00:12:16,067 --> 00:12:19,332
It was used to test old versions of Hades

288
00:12:19,372 --> 00:12:20,734
against old versions of Gaia.

289
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:23,519
So that's why Aloy thinks she can find a copy of Gaia here.

290
00:12:25,383 --> 00:12:27,044
These are cinematic placeholders right now

291
00:12:27,144 --> 00:12:29,986
because we didn't actually know what those were gonna be.

292
00:12:30,366 --> 00:12:31,987
We didn't really know how to handle something

293
00:12:32,007 --> 00:12:34,809
that wasn't a cinematic but not a gameplay interaction.

294
00:12:35,229 --> 00:12:37,470
So for the time being, we treated them as cinematics.

295
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:42,013
But we wanted to do these semi-interactive moments

296
00:12:42,053 --> 00:12:44,134
where Aloy's messing with holographic UI.

297
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:46,415
This is an early version of the spider

298
00:12:46,455 --> 00:12:47,396
where we climbed on it.

299
00:12:48,977 --> 00:12:50,398
This is not something we ended up shipping with,

300
00:12:50,418 --> 00:12:51,758
but I still think it's a really cool idea.

301
00:12:53,726 --> 00:12:56,429
Aloy now gets the copy of Guy out of this kernel.

302
00:12:56,449 --> 00:12:58,271
There's a cinematic there that I'm skipping over

303
00:12:58,291 --> 00:13:00,053
because it's super spoilery.

304
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:02,876
And then this bad guy shows up.

305
00:13:03,536 --> 00:13:05,358
And he's here to choke the life out of you.

306
00:13:05,979 --> 00:13:07,781
He's this slow moving humanoid guy

307
00:13:07,801 --> 00:13:08,982
that chases you around the space.

308
00:13:09,383 --> 00:13:11,104
And the only way Aloy can escape this space

309
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,447
is by dropping the spider, getting it to fall down.

310
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,307
We do that by shooting weak points on the spider.

311
00:13:17,608 --> 00:13:18,669
After a certain amount of weak points,

312
00:13:18,689 --> 00:13:20,471
there's a phase transition cinematic,

313
00:13:20,871 --> 00:13:22,052
and then you shoot some more weak points

314
00:13:22,312 --> 00:13:23,934
while trying to get away from this guy,

315
00:13:24,294 --> 00:13:27,457
and then eventually that opens up an interaction

316
00:13:27,517 --> 00:13:28,698
with the Recluse processor

317
00:13:28,738 --> 00:13:30,660
where it kind of drops down to a lower level,

318
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,002
and you use a use location underneath it

319
00:13:33,042 --> 00:13:35,744
to trigger a cinematic where the spider

320
00:13:35,964 --> 00:13:37,626
falls down through the floor and you with it.

321
00:13:37,926 --> 00:13:38,987
So that's this right here.

322
00:13:47,618 --> 00:13:49,640
So now we fall into the old part of the bunker,

323
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:51,200
kind of this boiler room area

324
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,801
where we need to swim to escape.

325
00:13:53,922 --> 00:13:55,843
This has one of my favorite early parts

326
00:13:55,863 --> 00:13:56,803
of the levels hackery.

327
00:13:57,544 --> 00:14:00,245
We had no idea what the specters were gonna look like,

328
00:14:00,285 --> 00:14:01,406
this new kind of machine,

329
00:14:01,586 --> 00:14:02,766
and indeed it would take years

330
00:14:02,886 --> 00:14:04,867
before we got even a mock-up of one.

331
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,089
So what I used instead was human enemies

332
00:14:08,109 --> 00:14:10,230
from the first game with laser beams attached to their faces.

333
00:14:12,053 --> 00:14:13,574
We wanted to build something that was kind of like

334
00:14:13,614 --> 00:14:14,495
a stealth arena.

335
00:14:14,555 --> 00:14:17,297
We wanted this vibe of like, you're sneaking around

336
00:14:17,317 --> 00:14:18,578
and there's these really dangerous things

337
00:14:18,598 --> 00:14:19,738
that are sort of like turrets

338
00:14:19,938 --> 00:14:21,399
that are scanning around for you.

339
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,821
And if they spot you, then they shoot you.

340
00:14:23,861 --> 00:14:25,722
And so you really have to stay out of their line of sight.

341
00:14:26,082 --> 00:14:28,424
This would also kind of teach you about stealth and water

342
00:14:28,644 --> 00:14:29,384
and how that works.

343
00:14:29,724 --> 00:14:31,746
But we actually didn't know how any of that worked.

344
00:14:32,126 --> 00:14:35,628
So it took a while to figure out how, say for example,

345
00:14:36,048 --> 00:14:38,690
machines could or couldn't spot you underwater.

346
00:14:39,671 --> 00:14:41,172
But these were our early experiments.

347
00:14:42,662 --> 00:14:45,066
You can also see we have some pullable vents in here

348
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:48,031
for underwater that are very early versions.

349
00:14:48,571 --> 00:14:51,316
There's also a pullcaster interaction right here

350
00:14:51,356 --> 00:14:53,219
that survives even until the final version

351
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:56,745
where you get out of the water to pull open this vent.

352
00:15:13,310 --> 00:15:17,053
And then in this final section, there's something kind of like a gauntlet where you'd swim into

353
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:19,075
a big space where you think you're home free.

354
00:15:19,856 --> 00:15:24,740
And one of these specters would blast open the ceiling and rain fire down upon you.

355
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:30,045
So you'd have to swim really quickly through the fire, through the strafing fire.

356
00:15:30,065 --> 00:15:31,126
There you go.

357
00:15:31,166 --> 00:15:31,767
That's that guy.

358
00:15:33,208 --> 00:15:34,309
But he can't actually shoot at you.

359
00:15:34,329 --> 00:15:35,390
He has no idea what's going on.

360
00:15:36,411 --> 00:15:37,592
He's like, you're in water?

361
00:15:37,832 --> 00:15:38,493
What's water?

362
00:15:41,117 --> 00:15:42,118
And then here at the end of the level,

363
00:15:42,138 --> 00:15:44,298
there's another one of these breach charge interactions

364
00:15:44,378 --> 00:15:46,879
and blowing this door open allows Aloy to escape.

365
00:15:50,001 --> 00:15:51,601
So, just for ease of reference,

366
00:15:51,721 --> 00:15:54,142
I want to quickly label some of the areas of the bunker

367
00:15:54,282 --> 00:15:55,082
that we just looked at,

368
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:56,703
because we'll be talking a lot about them.

369
00:15:57,623 --> 00:15:59,204
So first we have the central hallway,

370
00:16:00,124 --> 00:16:01,085
the communications center,

371
00:16:02,885 --> 00:16:04,906
the swim labs, this area here,

372
00:16:06,167 --> 00:16:07,047
the recluse chamber,

373
00:16:08,127 --> 00:16:09,348
and lastly the swim escape.

374
00:16:12,685 --> 00:16:15,307
Okay, so once the skeleton is submitted and approved,

375
00:16:15,827 --> 00:16:17,748
we now proceed to turn the skeleton quest

376
00:16:17,788 --> 00:16:19,149
into what we call a first playable.

377
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:20,469
That's a bit confusing, right,

378
00:16:20,489 --> 00:16:21,910
because that was clearly playable, right?

379
00:16:23,391 --> 00:16:26,592
But there are a few key differences

380
00:16:26,632 --> 00:16:28,593
between what's a skeleton and what's first playable.

381
00:16:29,534 --> 00:16:30,895
So what does constitute first playable?

382
00:16:31,735 --> 00:16:34,356
It's about bringing all gameplay to a representative state.

383
00:16:34,977 --> 00:16:36,717
Any gameplay in the skeleton that we explain

384
00:16:36,757 --> 00:16:39,879
with a text box or that needs further development

385
00:16:39,919 --> 00:16:41,860
to actually look something like what we intend,

386
00:16:42,737 --> 00:16:44,678
that's what actually we need to transition

387
00:16:44,718 --> 00:16:45,539
into proper gameplay.

388
00:16:46,360 --> 00:16:48,262
The first playable's the first version of the quest

389
00:16:48,282 --> 00:16:49,883
where we'll start playtesting externally.

390
00:16:50,664 --> 00:16:52,826
And thinking back on the skeleton quest video I just showed,

391
00:16:52,846 --> 00:16:54,447
there are a few areas that we really wanted

392
00:16:54,467 --> 00:16:57,610
to spend time developing up to representative quality.

393
00:16:59,358 --> 00:17:00,539
starting with the communications center.

394
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,420
We didn't feel that the space

395
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,381
and the puzzle placeholder inside were representative

396
00:17:04,421 --> 00:17:05,582
of what we really wanted to do.

397
00:17:06,202 --> 00:17:08,343
We knew we wanted to do a new kind of power puzzle,

398
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:10,124
a follow-up to the multi-lock,

399
00:17:10,224 --> 00:17:12,045
but we didn't really know what that was yet.

400
00:17:12,105 --> 00:17:12,765
We still didn't.

401
00:17:13,906 --> 00:17:15,507
And the space itself also had to tell

402
00:17:15,567 --> 00:17:16,827
kind of a specific story.

403
00:17:17,828 --> 00:17:19,108
And so we relied on concept art

404
00:17:19,128 --> 00:17:20,169
to kind of help us get there.

405
00:17:21,523 --> 00:17:23,685
This room is the one point of communication

406
00:17:23,845 --> 00:17:24,665
in and out of the bunker.

407
00:17:25,106 --> 00:17:26,447
Because of the dangerous experiments

408
00:17:26,487 --> 00:17:27,468
conducted in this facility,

409
00:17:27,828 --> 00:17:29,469
no unsecured data could come in or out.

410
00:17:30,210 --> 00:17:31,891
We wanted to tell that story while at the same time

411
00:17:31,951 --> 00:17:34,393
forcing the player to engage with a new type of power puzzle.

412
00:17:35,974 --> 00:17:37,676
So you see there's this object marked

413
00:17:37,716 --> 00:17:39,937
like power facility up there at the top for instance.

414
00:17:42,419 --> 00:17:42,559
So.

415
00:17:42,579 --> 00:17:43,840
Oh.

416
00:17:45,842 --> 00:17:46,282
What's this?

417
00:17:47,003 --> 00:17:48,364
Some kind of command center?

418
00:17:49,212 --> 00:17:51,752
So you can see that I reworked the space to be based on this

419
00:17:51,792 --> 00:17:55,614
kind of curved concept with this console, with this screen. And

420
00:17:55,694 --> 00:17:58,194
we tried out some new puzzle concepts in here, new uses of

421
00:17:58,214 --> 00:18:00,815
the pull caster where we have these pullable boxes that you

422
00:18:00,835 --> 00:18:03,176
can yoink around the space using the pull caster that will allow

423
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:06,537
you to climb up to higher spaces. There's also this object

424
00:18:06,577 --> 00:18:09,818
here that's kind of like a back up generator and we wanted to

425
00:18:09,898 --> 00:18:12,079
try some kind of novel interaction here where you'd

426
00:18:12,239 --> 00:18:14,779
override it maybe with a mini game or some kind of thing like

427
00:18:14,820 --> 00:18:17,280
this. But for the moment it's just a hack point.

428
00:18:20,443 --> 00:18:22,163
Early on, we thought that it'd be really cool

429
00:18:22,203 --> 00:18:24,184
to use this screen that you see over here on the wall

430
00:18:24,264 --> 00:18:26,504
and show you that when you powered this thing up,

431
00:18:26,544 --> 00:18:28,805
that there might be like a giant antenna outside

432
00:18:28,845 --> 00:18:31,786
in the world that would extend and change the world outside.

433
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:34,146
But it's something that just sort of fell

434
00:18:34,166 --> 00:18:35,027
to the wayside over time.

435
00:18:35,067 --> 00:18:36,687
It was something too expensive for us

436
00:18:36,727 --> 00:18:38,087
to mock up in any meaningful way.

437
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:42,028
So when you power the room up, now we get the cinematic.

438
00:18:45,583 --> 00:18:47,324
The next area we wanted to make some changes to

439
00:18:47,364 --> 00:18:49,266
was the lower level flooded residential area,

440
00:18:49,686 --> 00:18:51,708
and we really wanted to execute on a specific vision.

441
00:18:52,548 --> 00:18:54,330
We had an idea early on to try to achieve

442
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:57,052
a unique cave diving feeling for the lab swim area.

443
00:18:57,672 --> 00:18:59,494
Bunkers in Horizon Zero Dawn have kind of

444
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:01,455
a cave-like aesthetic, so cave diving

445
00:19:01,475 --> 00:19:02,536
seems to make a lot of sense.

446
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:07,139
We needed to add lighting to get a representative feel

447
00:19:07,199 --> 00:19:08,700
of the gameplay, so that's something we did.

448
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,082
We did some very early rough lighting in here,

449
00:19:11,502 --> 00:19:13,943
and we experimented with the first version

450
00:19:13,963 --> 00:19:16,224
of a light on the player, which you'll see as well.

451
00:19:17,065 --> 00:19:19,246
We also got some help from concept art here

452
00:19:19,386 --> 00:19:20,427
to get a sense of the look.

453
00:19:21,167 --> 00:19:24,129
Here are some mood boards and explorations

454
00:19:24,149 --> 00:19:26,330
of what this cave diving concept would look like,

455
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,150
what it would feel like.

456
00:19:28,935 --> 00:19:30,417
This piece was really my North Star.

457
00:19:31,278 --> 00:19:33,079
I tried really hard to achieve this look

458
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:34,260
during the process of development

459
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,321
because I thought it was so cool.

460
00:19:36,663 --> 00:19:38,845
So, here's an iteration where we lit

461
00:19:38,885 --> 00:19:40,226
the swimming area very darkly.

462
00:19:40,566 --> 00:19:42,328
You can also see that there's a light on Aloy

463
00:19:42,368 --> 00:19:43,169
that's on her arm.

464
00:19:44,110 --> 00:19:46,112
We also added this like floating debris

465
00:19:46,132 --> 00:19:47,253
and all this stuff that you could kind of

466
00:19:47,293 --> 00:19:48,554
move around the space because we were trying

467
00:19:48,574 --> 00:19:49,675
to hit this vibe, right?

468
00:19:49,715 --> 00:19:50,716
We were trying to get this feeling.

469
00:19:51,096 --> 00:19:52,578
You'll also notice that we cut the puzzle.

470
00:19:53,380 --> 00:19:57,423
It just wasn't that important here. It wasn't something we wanted to add more friction to this space.

471
00:19:57,743 --> 00:20:01,185
We just wanted to get you used to swimming inside and that seemed frictional enough.

472
00:20:02,686 --> 00:20:09,271
It was also really important to teach you about swimming in interiors because later on during the escape you need to know how to do that already.

473
00:20:11,913 --> 00:20:15,395
You'll see that there's a bit of weird stuff here where the light is reflecting on the surface of the water.

474
00:20:15,455 --> 00:20:17,537
That's just some early versions of this.

475
00:20:26,257 --> 00:20:28,698
So this puzzle that's in the other space now,

476
00:20:28,819 --> 00:20:30,200
instead of finding a valve wheel,

477
00:20:30,420 --> 00:20:32,361
there's a treasure chest basically in the same spot.

478
00:20:32,381 --> 00:20:34,403
So we just kept the same space.

479
00:20:36,344 --> 00:20:37,605
So pretty much the same thing here.

480
00:20:39,246 --> 00:20:40,647
The next area we wanted to focus on

481
00:20:40,687 --> 00:20:42,308
was the recluse chamber boss battle.

482
00:20:44,630 --> 00:20:47,112
We wanted to add in the first representative spider model.

483
00:20:47,412 --> 00:20:49,013
We felt it was really important to give you

484
00:20:49,554 --> 00:20:50,975
the actual real thing,

485
00:20:51,335 --> 00:20:53,937
because my version was this really weird tinker toy spider.

486
00:20:55,585 --> 00:20:57,946
We wanted to add the pull caster into the boss fight.

487
00:20:58,006 --> 00:20:59,747
This boss fight was really more like a puzzle,

488
00:20:59,787 --> 00:21:02,527
so we wanted to add the new primary puzzle tool

489
00:21:02,587 --> 00:21:03,708
into it to see if that would work.

490
00:21:04,788 --> 00:21:06,028
We cut the climbing on the spider

491
00:21:06,169 --> 00:21:08,049
in favor of adding a sort of tutorial moment

492
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:09,730
because now we needed to teach you

493
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,310
that you needed to pull these weak points.

494
00:21:12,390 --> 00:21:13,791
That's why we needed a tutorial moment.

495
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:17,011
and we moved the weak points to the walls from the spider.

496
00:21:17,471 --> 00:21:19,251
In the earliest versions of people playing this,

497
00:21:19,271 --> 00:21:21,252
they just constantly looked up at the spider the whole time

498
00:21:21,292 --> 00:21:23,272
and just ran around it and they never looked at the dude.

499
00:21:23,873 --> 00:21:26,133
So we thought, let's move the weak points out into the space

500
00:21:26,173 --> 00:21:27,694
and so you have to look around the space more

501
00:21:27,734 --> 00:21:28,894
so you see the bad guy.

502
00:21:30,814 --> 00:21:33,355
We also got this piece of concept art at this point

503
00:21:33,435 --> 00:21:35,936
and this was like the one before, kind of my North Star.

504
00:21:35,956 --> 00:21:37,376
This is the thing I wanted to try to hit

505
00:21:37,396 --> 00:21:38,836
because I thought this was an awesome vibe.

506
00:21:40,637 --> 00:21:42,277
So here's the very first playable version

507
00:21:42,297 --> 00:21:43,758
of that animating recluse spider.

508
00:21:45,962 --> 00:21:48,584
You'll also notice that the cage around here is not a sphere.

509
00:21:48,604 --> 00:21:51,747
That was extremely hard to mock up, so I used this kind of cage shape in the beginning.

510
00:22:03,572 --> 00:22:06,774
So when you use this console, we now kick in this tutorial moment that I was talking

511
00:22:06,814 --> 00:22:07,274
about before.

512
00:22:07,514 --> 00:22:11,397
We're going to get back to this idea of a tutorial moment or a nugget here in a second.

513
00:22:11,918 --> 00:22:17,722
But the idea was, okay, whenever the spider's arms pull on these cables, it activates these

514
00:22:17,822 --> 00:22:19,203
stabilizers on the walls.

515
00:22:19,823 --> 00:22:24,026
And you have to pull open first kind of an armored shell on them, and then you blast

516
00:22:24,066 --> 00:22:26,208
them and that makes the cable snap.

517
00:22:26,588 --> 00:22:28,049
The arm drops, you can activate it.

518
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,642
Now we got a new version of our boss.

519
00:22:30,702 --> 00:22:33,124
The previous version was just an old version of Helus

520
00:22:33,244 --> 00:22:34,064
from the first game,

521
00:22:34,465 --> 00:22:36,146
who would walk around after you menacingly.

522
00:22:36,166 --> 00:22:38,147
This new guy actually has some attacks.

523
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,508
He can throw grenades and stuff.

524
00:22:41,289 --> 00:22:42,750
These are our new weak points on the walls.

525
00:22:43,470 --> 00:22:46,172
As you can see, this is slightly problematic.

526
00:22:46,252 --> 00:22:48,753
Still, the player's just kind of running around

527
00:22:48,793 --> 00:22:49,754
the whole place,

528
00:22:49,774 --> 00:22:52,775
yoinking off the covers and then shooting them.

529
00:22:53,516 --> 00:22:54,897
So clearly this wasn't very good.

530
00:22:55,177 --> 00:22:56,558
We had problems with this.

531
00:22:56,578 --> 00:22:57,598
So we were gonna try something new.

532
00:23:01,162 --> 00:23:02,803
So to summarize, what did we do

533
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:04,425
during the first playable phase?

534
00:23:04,786 --> 00:23:05,807
We brought all the gameplay

535
00:23:05,827 --> 00:23:07,268
to a more representative quality

536
00:23:07,388 --> 00:23:09,230
with the exception of the swim escape,

537
00:23:09,370 --> 00:23:10,872
the part with the laser beam phase dudes.

538
00:23:11,753 --> 00:23:12,354
More on that later.

539
00:23:13,515 --> 00:23:14,956
We have some new puzzles that we added.

540
00:23:15,297 --> 00:23:16,858
We've got a new mood for the swim labs.

541
00:23:17,739 --> 00:23:19,881
We have the first proper animating recluse in

542
00:23:19,922 --> 00:23:21,263
as well as some boss fight tweaks.

543
00:23:21,884 --> 00:23:23,345
And we're ready for external playtesting.

544
00:23:24,875 --> 00:23:26,157
With the first playable done and approved,

545
00:23:26,197 --> 00:23:28,780
we move into a period of iteration and parallel development.

546
00:23:29,461 --> 00:23:30,102
What happens here?

547
00:23:30,603 --> 00:23:32,005
We're getting regular playtest feedback

548
00:23:32,025 --> 00:23:33,286
that informs our decision making.

549
00:23:33,747 --> 00:23:35,850
We're now at a level of certainty about the content

550
00:23:35,870 --> 00:23:37,432
that we're comfortable with other departments being.

551
00:23:38,208 --> 00:23:40,309
commit resources to the level.

552
00:23:40,969 --> 00:23:42,610
The art passes start being integrated,

553
00:23:43,010 --> 00:23:44,971
core technical design, a new team at Guerrilla

554
00:23:45,091 --> 00:23:46,731
starts helping us with the recluse chamber

555
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,512
and the spider because it's so complicated,

556
00:23:49,032 --> 00:23:51,253
and I begin to work on some other quests in parallel.

557
00:23:51,353 --> 00:23:52,293
This is my first quest,

558
00:23:52,333 --> 00:23:54,314
but only one of seven quests that I made.

559
00:23:54,814 --> 00:23:56,235
So I start to work on some other things.

560
00:23:58,595 --> 00:24:00,016
So one of the other quests that I work on

561
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:01,996
was a quest called Seeds of the Past,

562
00:24:02,197 --> 00:24:03,717
which is related to the AI Demeter.

563
00:24:05,145 --> 00:24:07,768
Early playtesting told us that the puzzles in Death's Door were too simple.

564
00:24:08,188 --> 00:24:11,271
We knew that. We're still trying to figure out this new power puzzle mechanic.

565
00:24:12,612 --> 00:24:18,678
In response to that, we played around with a new power puzzle concept called the Charged Spear that I want to show you.

566
00:24:20,663 --> 00:24:23,405
So, I was telling you about that tutorial moment earlier.

567
00:24:23,545 --> 00:24:25,787
This is something that a new designer from Eidos, Montreal

568
00:24:25,827 --> 00:24:28,349
coming in taught me about that they have there,

569
00:24:28,409 --> 00:24:30,010
which is the idea of a nugget puzzle.

570
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:33,452
So in open world games, it's really tough to teach puzzles

571
00:24:33,593 --> 00:24:35,234
and to get players to remember puzzles

572
00:24:35,294 --> 00:24:37,115
because we don't know how long it's been

573
00:24:37,195 --> 00:24:38,396
since you've seen the puzzle.

574
00:24:38,896 --> 00:24:40,097
We were playing around with using this

575
00:24:40,137 --> 00:24:41,078
in the tall neck as well.

576
00:24:42,019 --> 00:24:43,639
So I didn't know if you had done that before.

577
00:24:43,699 --> 00:24:46,040
I didn't know if you had learned about this puzzle concept.

578
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:51,021
So I needed a really small little instance of it to either teach it to you or to get

579
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,001
you to remember it.

580
00:24:52,361 --> 00:24:53,482
And that's what this is here.

581
00:24:53,542 --> 00:24:54,382
It's called a nugget.

582
00:24:54,822 --> 00:24:58,563
Basically, you come into this room, you see a charging station, you charge up your spear

583
00:24:58,583 --> 00:25:02,284
with it, you go over to this receptacle, you plug it in, the energy goes into it and it

584
00:25:02,424 --> 00:25:03,084
unlocks the door.

585
00:25:03,624 --> 00:25:09,367
Same concept in here. There's a receptacle on that opposite wall. You need to charge up your spear using that battery in the other room

586
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:13,349
You need to cross over this space and you need to plug in your spear to power up this room

587
00:25:14,009 --> 00:25:19,532
Now the twist is the the aspect of this that you'll notice that's new is there's a thin layer of water on the floor

588
00:25:20,072 --> 00:25:25,115
The idea of the charge spear was you can carry around this charge in your spear so long as you don't touch water

589
00:25:25,875 --> 00:25:27,736
If you touch water, the charge dissipates,

590
00:25:28,556 --> 00:25:30,417
and then you have to go back and get a new charge.

591
00:25:30,757 --> 00:25:33,197
There's also still this aspect of yoinking stuff

592
00:25:33,217 --> 00:25:34,738
around the room using the pullcaster

593
00:25:34,778 --> 00:25:36,098
to make a bridge for yourself

594
00:25:36,138 --> 00:25:37,659
to be able to cross across the space.

595
00:25:40,819 --> 00:25:42,660
So the player's gonna go back over here to the battery,

596
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:45,161
gonna plug in her spear, get a charge in it,

597
00:25:45,381 --> 00:25:46,421
and then come back to the room.

598
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,843
But just as an example, you'll see here

599
00:25:53,883 --> 00:25:55,143
what happens when you jump in the water.

600
00:25:56,876 --> 00:25:57,737
The charge dissipates.

601
00:25:59,077 --> 00:26:01,638
Our design director, he didn't love that version of it.

602
00:26:01,859 --> 00:26:03,659
He wanted a version where we had deeper water,

603
00:26:03,779 --> 00:26:04,680
which is what this is.

604
00:26:05,000 --> 00:26:06,541
He felt like the thin layer of water

605
00:26:06,621 --> 00:26:09,022
just felt too much like a children's game,

606
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:10,903
you know, like don't touch the lava on the floor.

607
00:26:11,203 --> 00:26:12,984
It doesn't feel heroic to have to avoid

608
00:26:13,024 --> 00:26:14,425
like a half inch of water on the floor.

609
00:26:15,025 --> 00:26:16,846
So we tried this version with deeper water.

610
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:19,747
Also, this is the first version of the hologram

611
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,768
you can see that goes in here when you power up the room.

612
00:26:21,988 --> 00:26:23,289
I thought it was super cool that the hologram,

613
00:26:23,329 --> 00:26:24,850
people were all talking to each other underwater.

614
00:26:27,425 --> 00:26:30,386
So, the art passes start coming in here.

615
00:26:31,827 --> 00:26:32,887
What happens during the art pass,

616
00:26:32,947 --> 00:26:35,168
I receive from the artist new art files

617
00:26:35,208 --> 00:26:36,489
that I have to hook up into the game.

618
00:26:36,949 --> 00:26:38,250
They don't do this because if they did it,

619
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,170
it would break a bunch of stuff.

620
00:26:40,111 --> 00:26:41,731
I compare my block out to the new art

621
00:26:41,791 --> 00:26:43,232
because things always shift around,

622
00:26:43,832 --> 00:26:46,113
and so I have to move my objects around in the space,

623
00:26:47,154 --> 00:26:50,095
and I have to delete my block mesh stuff,

624
00:26:50,135 --> 00:26:51,356
kind of like one piece at a time

625
00:26:51,376 --> 00:26:53,257
to make sure that it's accurately represented.

626
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:57,487
Typically we have two art passes and then a lighting pass.

627
00:26:58,109 --> 00:26:59,834
From now on, you'll mostly be seeing

628
00:27:00,035 --> 00:27:01,620
arted spaces and lit spaces.

629
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,665
So here's the same puzzle space,

630
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:06,206
the same kind of area we've been looking at,

631
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:08,108
but with the first art pass, for instance.

632
00:27:08,789 --> 00:27:10,610
Now there's still design changes happening here.

633
00:27:10,670 --> 00:27:14,033
For instance, we wanted to pull you here to this obstruction

634
00:27:14,073 --> 00:27:16,114
to see the second gene lock door in the distance

635
00:27:16,254 --> 00:27:18,857
more closely, and so we moved the door,

636
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:21,298
the entrance to that command center, around the corner

637
00:27:21,779 --> 00:27:23,300
so that you wouldn't be drawn to it

638
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,422
before you were drawn to this big obstruction

639
00:27:25,462 --> 00:27:26,322
in the middle of the hallway.

640
00:27:26,763 --> 00:27:28,644
Then here's that same command center space

641
00:27:28,925 --> 00:27:30,466
with the deeper water that I just showed you,

642
00:27:30,606 --> 00:27:31,246
but with an art pass.

643
00:27:33,605 --> 00:27:34,566
So, the swim labs.

644
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:36,628
For several play tests,

645
00:27:36,648 --> 00:27:38,470
the feedback on the swimming parts of the level

646
00:27:38,510 --> 00:27:39,491
had been pretty negative.

647
00:27:39,971 --> 00:27:42,213
But we really believed in this type of experience

648
00:27:42,894 --> 00:27:43,995
that we were trying to present.

649
00:27:44,495 --> 00:27:45,956
And we felt that it was the swimming system,

650
00:27:45,996 --> 00:27:47,057
the idea of swimming underwater,

651
00:27:47,097 --> 00:27:48,479
that needed some iteration time,

652
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:49,940
that needed some time to be developed.

653
00:27:50,861 --> 00:27:52,542
At a certain point, the core design team

654
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:55,537
came to us with revised guidelines and metrics

655
00:27:55,577 --> 00:27:57,679
for how swimming spaces should work.

656
00:27:58,359 --> 00:28:00,061
And unfortunately, this was right in the middle

657
00:28:00,081 --> 00:28:02,524
of the art pass, so we had to rush to try to adjust

658
00:28:02,564 --> 00:28:04,005
to some new metrics and ideas.

659
00:28:04,926 --> 00:28:08,209
So the vision was underwater swimming should be smooth,

660
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:11,372
fluid, fast, it shouldn't focus on slowed movement,

661
00:28:11,532 --> 00:28:13,634
oxygen deprivation, stress, darkness.

662
00:28:14,715 --> 00:28:16,898
Unfortunately, this is a lot of what we were doing.

663
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,742
So, just as an example, they made a whole bunch of videos

664
00:28:22,802 --> 00:28:25,404
of like, don't do this using parts of my level.

665
00:28:29,327 --> 00:28:30,908
Yeah.

666
00:28:31,168 --> 00:28:33,730
Avoid bad flows, avoid using hard-edged geometry,

667
00:28:35,010 --> 00:28:37,452
avoid placing tricky doorways and openings.

668
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:40,594
This is that tight space that you swam through earlier

669
00:28:40,634 --> 00:28:41,295
that I pointed out.

670
00:28:43,316 --> 00:28:44,737
Provide clear player direction.

671
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:52,940
So, we took another stab at changing the metrics in the swim labs, the most important change

672
00:28:52,980 --> 00:28:56,281
of which was we doubled the depth and doubled the width of everything.

673
00:28:56,541 --> 00:28:58,221
And we had to do that in the middle of the art pass.

674
00:28:58,702 --> 00:29:02,022
Here is the same space with an art pass with a lighting pass.

675
00:29:03,403 --> 00:29:05,723
And as you can see, everything is much deeper, much wider.

676
00:29:07,275 --> 00:29:09,616
Now, this wasn't the most popular change.

677
00:29:10,156 --> 00:29:12,456
It kind of strained credulity that we had a bunker

678
00:29:12,516 --> 00:29:16,177
with ceilings that were like 12 meters high, 20 meters high.

679
00:29:17,097 --> 00:29:19,578
But I think that when you see the space in practice,

680
00:29:19,738 --> 00:29:23,238
it doesn't really, it doesn't strike you as being that odd.

681
00:29:23,558 --> 00:29:25,759
But now you can see in here, we're getting much closer

682
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:27,199
to the right feeling, the right vibe, right?

683
00:29:27,259 --> 00:29:29,319
Holographic lighting, darkness.

684
00:29:30,339 --> 00:29:31,780
This is that tight hallway section.

685
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:33,780
I stripped a whole bunch of the obstacles out of it

686
00:29:33,820 --> 00:29:34,960
so it was easier to swim through.

687
00:29:36,362 --> 00:29:39,303
But players were still dealing with oxygen deprivation stress, right?

688
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:41,864
They didn't feel like they could just swim through this section easily.

689
00:29:52,189 --> 00:29:54,470
So, let's talk about the recluse chamber.

690
00:29:54,931 --> 00:29:55,411
What do we do there?

691
00:29:57,023 --> 00:29:59,865
So the effect of the art pass on the recluse chamber,

692
00:30:01,726 --> 00:30:03,247
that had some pretty big changes,

693
00:30:03,948 --> 00:30:05,249
and you'll see that in a second.

694
00:30:05,689 --> 00:30:06,510
I'm gonna show you a video.

695
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:08,651
We got assistance from Core Design.

696
00:30:09,372 --> 00:30:10,192
That was really important,

697
00:30:10,212 --> 00:30:12,654
because we needed help with this giant spider thing,

698
00:30:12,674 --> 00:30:13,795
because it needed to be rigged,

699
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:15,436
it needed to have complex scripting,

700
00:30:15,456 --> 00:30:16,477
it needed to have physics,

701
00:30:16,497 --> 00:30:17,578
it needed to have all kinds of stuff

702
00:30:17,598 --> 00:30:18,859
that we had no experience with.

703
00:30:20,360 --> 00:30:21,701
This was probably the most complicated

704
00:30:21,741 --> 00:30:23,062
interactive object in the whole game.

705
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:26,359
because people really thought of it like a machine

706
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,760
and those things are super complicated.

707
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,701
We also tried some new experiments with the boss fight

708
00:30:30,921 --> 00:30:32,082
and I'll talk about that in a second.

709
00:30:34,183 --> 00:30:34,943
As I showed you before,

710
00:30:35,003 --> 00:30:36,904
this was sort of my North Star concept art piece

711
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:37,984
but we decided to ditch this.

712
00:30:38,764 --> 00:30:41,225
This spider looks too much like a machine out in the world

713
00:30:41,325 --> 00:30:44,407
and it needs to look like something in an old world bunker.

714
00:30:44,447 --> 00:30:45,627
It needs to look like old world tech.

715
00:30:46,487 --> 00:30:47,808
So we moved in this direction.

716
00:30:48,248 --> 00:30:50,389
This was something that we actually kid bashed together

717
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:52,130
with a whole bunch of old bunker pieces.

718
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:55,734
So let me show you that.

719
00:30:57,675 --> 00:31:00,076
So this is the first like built out of art pieces

720
00:31:00,136 --> 00:31:03,498
version of the spider with actual physics derived chains

721
00:31:03,578 --> 00:31:04,898
and stuff like this, you'll see.

722
00:31:14,503 --> 00:31:16,804
Now we still have the tutorial moment here,

723
00:31:17,324 --> 00:31:19,025
but you'll see the weak points have changed a bit.

724
00:31:20,163 --> 00:31:22,704
We added this new idea which was a timing element.

725
00:31:22,904 --> 00:31:24,385
So you couldn't just run around the whole room

726
00:31:24,405 --> 00:31:26,246
and yoink all the covers off, shoot all the things.

727
00:31:26,827 --> 00:31:28,688
Now it was based on the movement of the spider,

728
00:31:28,748 --> 00:31:30,909
whether those weak points would be exposed to you or not.

729
00:31:38,834 --> 00:31:40,054
Boss is still pretty much the same,

730
00:31:40,074 --> 00:31:41,415
does pretty much the same stuff.

731
00:31:41,715 --> 00:31:42,856
Still has some ranged attacks,

732
00:31:43,456 --> 00:31:44,517
still tries to get up close to you.

733
00:31:49,728 --> 00:31:51,029
But now we have these weak points

734
00:31:51,049 --> 00:31:52,830
that are time dependent basically.

735
00:31:55,993 --> 00:31:58,775
So we also, like I said, did some experiments with the boss.

736
00:31:59,876 --> 00:32:00,997
The feedback on this version,

737
00:32:02,218 --> 00:32:03,900
players still never look at the boss.

738
00:32:05,021 --> 00:32:06,161
The weak points are too high.

739
00:32:06,262 --> 00:32:08,083
You have to push the camera up really high

740
00:32:08,103 --> 00:32:08,704
to see these things.

741
00:32:09,464 --> 00:32:10,505
The weak points are too simple.

742
00:32:12,607 --> 00:32:14,709
So we tried to fix this by doing some things.

743
00:32:14,789 --> 00:32:16,570
We tried to move the weak points down.

744
00:32:17,379 --> 00:32:20,522
We tried to change them to be either shoot or pull,

745
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:21,543
but not both.

746
00:32:22,124 --> 00:32:24,046
We just kind of couldn't make up our mind

747
00:32:24,107 --> 00:32:25,428
whether we wanted to do pull or shoot

748
00:32:25,448 --> 00:32:27,010
because they both seem to have their merits.

749
00:32:27,130 --> 00:32:28,932
So we tried both for a while.

750
00:32:30,614 --> 00:32:32,036
And we added this new mechanic

751
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:33,498
that I'll show you, the pulsing shield.

752
00:32:34,858 --> 00:32:38,499
So to try to tackle the idea that nobody looks at the boss,

753
00:32:38,980 --> 00:32:40,801
I added this idea, we added this idea

754
00:32:40,881 --> 00:32:43,822
that when you shoot the boss, it would overload his shield

755
00:32:43,962 --> 00:32:46,123
and make this EMP pulse emanate out,

756
00:32:46,363 --> 00:32:48,744
and that's what would expose the weak points.

757
00:32:49,524 --> 00:32:52,286
I really like this idea because it forced engagement

758
00:32:52,306 --> 00:32:54,667
with the boss, and it contextualized

759
00:32:55,067 --> 00:32:58,168
the weak points becoming exposed, as you see here.

760
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:00,785
But this had problems too.

761
00:33:00,965 --> 00:33:03,248
It didn't really jive with the fiction

762
00:33:03,308 --> 00:33:04,189
we were trying to tell you,

763
00:33:04,209 --> 00:33:07,513
which is this guy was a super invulnerable future guy

764
00:33:07,553 --> 00:33:08,714
that you just couldn't hurt at all,

765
00:33:09,215 --> 00:33:10,636
whereas we were asking you to shoot him.

766
00:33:12,939 --> 00:33:14,220
The swim escape, lastly.

767
00:33:15,554 --> 00:33:19,078
We haven't talked about this for a while because it stayed pretty much the same for a long

768
00:33:19,118 --> 00:33:19,319
time.

769
00:33:20,099 --> 00:33:23,143
We still had no idea what the specters were going to look like or how big they were going

770
00:33:23,163 --> 00:33:28,009
to be, but during this period concept art came to our aid and gave us some paints to

771
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:30,872
try to give us a sense of how this space would look and how the specters would fit in it.

772
00:33:31,733 --> 00:33:33,955
This was the very first image I got of a spectre.

773
00:33:34,275 --> 00:33:36,317
To this point, I had no idea how big they were,

774
00:33:36,377 --> 00:33:37,298
what they were gonna look like.

775
00:33:38,619 --> 00:33:40,440
And this is like the very early spectre.

776
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,882
You can notice it has like weird, creepy human hands,

777
00:33:43,603 --> 00:33:45,665
which is something we didn't have in the finished version.

778
00:33:46,846 --> 00:33:49,648
We also got some paint overs of my mocked up spaces

779
00:33:49,688 --> 00:33:52,530
that gave this sense of this kind of boiler room vibe.

780
00:33:52,931 --> 00:33:55,853
This end up in the ship product.

781
00:33:55,873 --> 00:33:56,894
This is pretty much how it looks.

782
00:33:58,977 --> 00:34:01,138
I wanted to tell the story of an older part of the facility

783
00:34:01,979 --> 00:34:03,700
and these images really helped us understand

784
00:34:03,760 --> 00:34:04,761
how we could deliver on that.

785
00:34:06,122 --> 00:34:09,104
So, during this period of iteration and parallel development

786
00:34:09,124 --> 00:34:11,145
we tried out new puzzle concepts,

787
00:34:11,946 --> 00:34:13,567
we integrated the first art passes,

788
00:34:13,687 --> 00:34:15,708
we reworked the swim labs to new metrics,

789
00:34:16,449 --> 00:34:18,570
we changed much of the recluse spider chamber

790
00:34:18,650 --> 00:34:19,711
in response to art needs,

791
00:34:21,212 --> 00:34:22,673
and we got concept art support

792
00:34:22,893 --> 00:34:24,454
to help us move forward with the swim escape.

793
00:34:26,255 --> 00:34:27,796
Now, does anyone know what's coming?

794
00:34:28,885 --> 00:34:29,146
March 2020.

795
00:34:29,486 --> 00:34:34,030
The last meeting I remember having in our old office

796
00:34:34,070 --> 00:34:35,451
on the canals of Amsterdam was a meeting

797
00:34:35,471 --> 00:34:36,452
with my lead and producer.

798
00:34:36,933 --> 00:34:38,314
They pulled me into the boardroom to tell me

799
00:34:38,334 --> 00:34:39,955
that Matthias, our game director, wanted me

800
00:34:39,975 --> 00:34:43,499
to make a pitch for a bold reinvention of Death's Door.

801
00:34:44,279 --> 00:34:46,241
Shortly thereafter, the heads of the studio reached out

802
00:34:46,261 --> 00:34:48,843
to let us know that we were shifting the entire company

803
00:34:49,144 --> 00:34:51,606
to a remote working model in response to a new pandemic.

804
00:34:52,246 --> 00:34:53,628
I think you all know how that went.

805
00:34:54,975 --> 00:34:56,897
For the foreseeable future, Gorilla would be working

806
00:34:56,937 --> 00:34:59,858
from home and my task was to come up with a bold new pitch.

807
00:35:01,900 --> 00:35:04,421
So why did we go about doing a rework?

808
00:35:04,621 --> 00:35:06,282
Let me talk for a moment about Ace Pillars.

809
00:35:07,523 --> 00:35:10,005
So Ace was a tool that we started using in this time

810
00:35:10,045 --> 00:35:12,606
to help us identify shortcomings in the design of the game.

811
00:35:13,644 --> 00:35:14,965
A is for astonishing.

812
00:35:15,526 --> 00:35:19,049
We felt collectively like the content in the early part of the bunker wasn't astonishing

813
00:35:19,089 --> 00:35:19,309
enough.

814
00:35:19,489 --> 00:35:22,671
It didn't equal some of the wow moments in bunkers in the first game.

815
00:35:23,112 --> 00:35:26,535
Think about the giant Titan room in the Grave Horde, for instance.

816
00:35:27,796 --> 00:35:28,896
C is for challenging.

817
00:35:29,057 --> 00:35:31,999
The puzzles in the swim section weren't challenging players enough.

818
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:33,280
Frustrating, yes.

819
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:34,361
Challenging, no.

820
00:35:35,862 --> 00:35:36,844
E is for engaging.

821
00:35:37,084 --> 00:35:39,347
We weren't making full use of the suite of new tools

822
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:40,348
at Aloy's disposal.

823
00:35:40,688 --> 00:35:43,412
We wanted to add some of the new Forbidden West mechanics

824
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:45,674
here like the shield wing and the grappling hook.

825
00:35:47,457 --> 00:35:50,781
So, I started off by outlining a new set of goals

826
00:35:50,921 --> 00:35:53,224
informed by those conversations and feedback.

827
00:35:54,682 --> 00:35:56,844
The goals were provide an astonishing moment

828
00:35:56,924 --> 00:35:58,225
shortly after entering the bunker,

829
00:35:58,605 --> 00:36:00,727
focus on challenging traversal gameplay

830
00:36:01,367 --> 00:36:03,769
through an epic space using grappling, pulling, and gliding,

831
00:36:04,289 --> 00:36:05,410
give the player a clear sense

832
00:36:05,450 --> 00:36:06,651
that they're moving towards a goal,

833
00:36:06,831 --> 00:36:08,052
that is the second gene locked door,

834
00:36:08,072 --> 00:36:09,273
while progressing through the space.

835
00:36:09,994 --> 00:36:11,895
I also outlined a set of limitations.

836
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:15,452
Shrink the square footage for the purpose of art and lighting.

837
00:36:15,632 --> 00:36:17,553
The zenith must be able to navigate the space

838
00:36:17,593 --> 00:36:19,414
where they follow you in, those are the bad guys.

839
00:36:20,074 --> 00:36:22,195
And we need to maintain the communication center

840
00:36:22,395 --> 00:36:24,917
and Traff's room, that office at the end of the swim labs,

841
00:36:25,257 --> 00:36:28,298
as locations for the player where they have to experience

842
00:36:28,358 --> 00:36:29,779
essential storytelling moments.

843
00:36:30,539 --> 00:36:32,420
Now it's important to have goals and limitations

844
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:34,001
because you have to sell both.

845
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,002
When you come up with a new pitch,

846
00:36:36,382 --> 00:36:38,043
you have to get the people you're pitching to

847
00:36:38,063 --> 00:36:39,744
to understand the goals and limitations

848
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:42,525
so they understand how your pitch matches those needs.

849
00:36:44,200 --> 00:36:46,042
So here's the pitch, I've grayed out most of it

850
00:36:46,062 --> 00:36:47,264
because it's not directly relevant.

851
00:36:47,284 --> 00:36:48,245
I don't want to read the whole thing.

852
00:36:48,546 --> 00:36:49,387
Here's the relevant bits.

853
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:51,783
Just beyond the security checkpoint,

854
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:54,044
the player encounters a vast passage like a tunnel,

855
00:36:54,104 --> 00:36:56,545
roughly 100 meters long and 25 meters wide,

856
00:36:56,685 --> 00:36:58,086
ending with another gene lock door.

857
00:36:58,546 --> 00:37:01,347
This passage once featured a long suspended catwalk.

858
00:37:01,748 --> 00:37:03,568
This catwalk is now mostly broken.

859
00:37:04,189 --> 00:37:06,330
Luckily, this catwalk branched in a few locations

860
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,770
to connect to corridors and rooms

861
00:37:07,870 --> 00:37:09,531
along both walls of the passage.

862
00:37:10,011 --> 00:37:12,132
By accessing those adjacent offices and structures,

863
00:37:12,273 --> 00:37:15,314
Aloy can weave her way along and across the shattered passage

864
00:37:15,734 --> 00:37:18,876
using grapple points, pullable IOs, and shield wing glides.

865
00:37:19,536 --> 00:37:21,217
While weaving back and forth across the chamber,

866
00:37:21,438 --> 00:37:24,160
Aloy must still activate the Dust Palace Communication Center

867
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,061
and pass through Travis's room,

868
00:37:26,182 --> 00:37:27,823
potentially with a new kind of puzzle,

869
00:37:28,323 --> 00:37:30,205
preserving those essential story beats.

870
00:37:32,467 --> 00:37:35,149
Here's my paper-level design of what that would look like.

871
00:37:35,910 --> 00:37:37,451
I wanted to demonstrate the idea here

872
00:37:37,491 --> 00:37:38,572
of a shattered passage,

873
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:39,893
the rooms that we were maintaining,

874
00:37:39,913 --> 00:37:42,015
and how Aloy would move back and forth through the space.

875
00:37:42,435 --> 00:37:44,917
I also threw together a really rough block mesh

876
00:37:45,238 --> 00:37:46,759
to give a sense of what that would look like.

877
00:37:48,538 --> 00:37:51,722
The response to this was, is this big enough?

878
00:37:51,842 --> 00:37:53,244
Is this actually a big enough change?

879
00:37:53,284 --> 00:37:54,666
Is it gonna give us the wow moment?

880
00:37:55,067 --> 00:37:56,208
So I made it even bigger.

881
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,434
I increased the size of the passage by double, essentially.

882
00:38:03,290 --> 00:38:05,151
Can the other departments, especially art and lighting,

883
00:38:05,191 --> 00:38:06,152
support this change?

884
00:38:06,272 --> 00:38:10,436
Well, concept art, again, supported us

885
00:38:10,636 --> 00:38:12,737
in giving us a look, some references

886
00:38:12,777 --> 00:38:13,978
that we could show environment art

887
00:38:14,319 --> 00:38:16,140
to tell them what they were gonna be building.

888
00:38:16,260 --> 00:38:17,822
They didn't know if they could build the new thing

889
00:38:17,862 --> 00:38:19,323
if they didn't know what it was gonna look like.

890
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:21,004
So concept art helped us out here.

891
00:38:22,165 --> 00:38:24,947
Here are a few renders of the concept art

892
00:38:25,007 --> 00:38:26,128
made based on my pitch.

893
00:38:28,025 --> 00:38:30,407
This was sort of informed, Misha, our art director,

894
00:38:30,467 --> 00:38:33,149
there's a level in Portal 2 that has a similar vibe to this

895
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:34,570
that we used as a bit of a touch point.

896
00:38:36,652 --> 00:38:37,693
But this gave us a sense,

897
00:38:37,753 --> 00:38:39,234
and we can show it to Environment Art and say,

898
00:38:39,354 --> 00:38:42,357
this is what we wanna make, can you buy in on that?

899
00:38:44,138 --> 00:38:45,259
This also unfortunately means

900
00:38:45,299 --> 00:38:46,680
that the swim lab section is cut.

901
00:38:48,101 --> 00:38:49,122
Poor one out for the swim labs.

902
00:38:50,242 --> 00:38:51,743
I was really hopeful we could make this work,

903
00:38:51,783 --> 00:38:54,424
but ultimately we were working against the goals of swimming

904
00:38:54,444 --> 00:38:55,525
in Horizon Forbidden West.

905
00:38:55,905 --> 00:38:57,926
There are other areas of the game where we did deliver

906
00:38:57,966 --> 00:39:00,287
on a vision of an interior swimming experience

907
00:39:00,307 --> 00:39:01,447
with holographic lighting.

908
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:03,308
If you played the game, you know what I'm talking about,

909
00:39:03,929 --> 00:39:04,649
and it works great.

910
00:39:05,029 --> 00:39:06,490
It just wasn't the right solution here.

911
00:39:08,571 --> 00:39:09,671
With this big change approved,

912
00:39:09,771 --> 00:39:12,052
I set out to re-block mesh the space based on the design.

913
00:39:19,247 --> 00:39:20,891
So here you go, this is my first block mesh.

914
00:39:21,212 --> 00:39:23,877
This video only shows the kind of central passage area.

915
00:39:25,242 --> 00:39:26,742
because I'm trying to keep it a little bit short,

916
00:39:26,802 --> 00:39:29,183
but you'll see that we focus on interactions here

917
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,143
using the pull tool, using the glider.

918
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:33,804
There are some spots here along the walls

919
00:39:33,844 --> 00:39:35,064
that are these pullable vents.

920
00:39:35,664 --> 00:39:38,745
I came up with this idea that it'd be cool

921
00:39:38,845 --> 00:39:42,406
if we had this idea of a pull caster enabled grapple point.

922
00:39:42,806 --> 00:39:44,486
And the reason why I came up with this

923
00:39:44,546 --> 00:39:47,026
is because I didn't want you to be able to just swim

924
00:39:47,086 --> 00:39:49,587
to the other end of the chamber and grapple your way up.

925
00:39:50,007 --> 00:39:52,367
And unfortunately, the grapple tool has incredible range,

926
00:39:52,468 --> 00:39:53,948
like really long range.

927
00:39:54,445 --> 00:39:55,366
But the pull tool doesn't.

928
00:39:56,086 --> 00:39:58,928
So if I make you get close to it first to pull it,

929
00:39:59,428 --> 00:40:00,609
and that enables the grapple,

930
00:40:00,989 --> 00:40:03,230
then I know at least that you've gotten this far

931
00:40:03,310 --> 00:40:05,091
in the level in the way that I intend.

932
00:40:07,192 --> 00:40:08,833
I also started playing around with this concept

933
00:40:08,873 --> 00:40:11,194
of spider-manning around pillars and structures

934
00:40:11,254 --> 00:40:12,115
using the grapple tool.

935
00:40:12,395 --> 00:40:16,137
This is something I came back to in Alva's companion quest

936
00:40:16,257 --> 00:40:17,538
later in the game in San Francisco.

937
00:40:17,698 --> 00:40:18,718
Of course he does.

938
00:40:19,279 --> 00:40:20,980
She needs to climb up to be able to reach him.

939
00:40:31,358 --> 00:40:33,199
So, this is another one of these pull-enabled grapples.

940
00:40:33,239 --> 00:40:36,741
This is before the moment where we force-reduce the shield wing by going across the whole

941
00:40:36,761 --> 00:40:37,081
chamber.

942
00:40:37,841 --> 00:40:40,282
You'll see that this moment in particular was kind of problematic.

943
00:40:40,322 --> 00:40:41,203
We'll talk about why later.

944
00:40:59,836 --> 00:41:00,577
I'm gonna move along here,

945
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:02,378
because we're gonna see more of this area later

946
00:41:02,438 --> 00:41:03,099
with our passes.

947
00:41:07,723 --> 00:41:09,845
So, the response to the rework of the main chamber

948
00:41:09,885 --> 00:41:10,745
was very positive.

949
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:12,567
This led to further discussions

950
00:41:12,587 --> 00:41:13,868
about what other parts of the bunker

951
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:15,810
we could possibly improve in the same way

952
00:41:15,870 --> 00:41:16,690
with the same process.

953
00:41:17,651 --> 00:41:18,732
What would a proposal like this

954
00:41:18,772 --> 00:41:20,694
for the recluse chamber boss fight look like?

955
00:41:22,792 --> 00:41:25,873
So, along the same lines, using the ace pillars,

956
00:41:27,054 --> 00:41:28,734
we got this feedback, astonishment,

957
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:30,695
the battle doesn't focus on the coolest asset of the room,

958
00:41:30,755 --> 00:41:33,536
the spider, the boss fight isn't challenging enough,

959
00:41:33,756 --> 00:41:35,336
players struggle to figure out what's going on,

960
00:41:35,356 --> 00:41:36,877
but they don't feel challenged to do it.

961
00:41:38,057 --> 00:41:41,258
Engagement, this falls flat because over time,

962
00:41:41,918 --> 00:41:43,399
the mechanic of overloading the shield

963
00:41:43,439 --> 00:41:46,040
doesn't really change, and Eric doesn't really change,

964
00:41:46,120 --> 00:41:48,260
so the fight feels really consistent throughout.

965
00:41:50,737 --> 00:41:53,479
So again, I went about setting some goals and limitations.

966
00:41:54,279 --> 00:41:56,300
The goals were to focus on the recluse spider first

967
00:41:56,460 --> 00:41:59,281
and Eric second, make the player objectives crystal clear,

968
00:41:59,481 --> 00:42:01,042
destroy the spider, survive Eric.

969
00:42:01,642 --> 00:42:02,563
Two phases of the battle.

970
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:04,664
Spider escalates, Eric escalates.

971
00:42:05,598 --> 00:42:08,240
Limitations, minimize changes to the cinematics here.

972
00:42:08,440 --> 00:42:10,462
There were these huge 10 minute long cinematics

973
00:42:10,502 --> 00:42:12,204
in the space and we didn't want to change those at all

974
00:42:12,244 --> 00:42:12,864
if we could avoid it.

975
00:42:13,705 --> 00:42:15,547
Use the Eric design that was provided by Combat

976
00:42:15,567 --> 00:42:17,689
which we finally got with some moves and abilities

977
00:42:17,729 --> 00:42:18,470
and stuff that he could do.

978
00:42:19,190 --> 00:42:21,012
And consider Fallout and the Cortec design

979
00:42:21,072 --> 00:42:22,673
because the spider is so complicated

980
00:42:22,713 --> 00:42:24,115
they had to help us with the rework.

981
00:42:25,336 --> 00:42:26,076
So this was the pitch.

982
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:28,198
Rework the weak points in a way

983
00:42:28,238 --> 00:42:29,499
that features the recluse spider.

984
00:42:30,795 --> 00:42:33,177
In phase one, the player shoots these coupling weak points

985
00:42:33,237 --> 00:42:35,439
on these strings that hold the arms to the ceiling.

986
00:42:36,339 --> 00:42:38,000
Severing the cables cause the recluses

987
00:42:38,041 --> 00:42:39,081
to swing back and forth.

988
00:42:39,422 --> 00:42:41,243
That complicates the timing of destroying

989
00:42:41,263 --> 00:42:42,624
these coupling weak points.

990
00:42:45,426 --> 00:42:47,247
Escalate the intensity of the boss fight over time

991
00:42:47,267 --> 00:42:48,028
with two phases.

992
00:42:48,388 --> 00:42:50,910
During phase one, Eric uses ranged projectile attacks

993
00:42:50,950 --> 00:42:51,570
to disrupt you.

994
00:42:52,351 --> 00:42:53,492
Once you cut all the strings,

995
00:42:53,532 --> 00:42:56,834
we have a special phase transition sequence that's returned.

996
00:42:59,014 --> 00:43:02,977
In that, the spider drops and that exposes some weak points on this sort of core cable

997
00:43:02,997 --> 00:43:05,400
that holds it to the ceiling, the kind of final string.

998
00:43:07,182 --> 00:43:10,505
To shoot that, you have to get to certain spots around the room because it's shielded

999
00:43:10,565 --> 00:43:12,887
in a way where you couldn't shoot all the sides from one spot.

1000
00:43:16,337 --> 00:43:18,099
And we need to escalate the intensity, sorry.

1001
00:43:18,119 --> 00:43:20,520
And we need to change what triggers

1002
00:43:20,540 --> 00:43:21,561
the collapse of the recluse.

1003
00:43:21,761 --> 00:43:23,682
So up until this point, it was what I showed you.

1004
00:43:23,982 --> 00:43:24,823
You showed all the weak points,

1005
00:43:24,863 --> 00:43:27,024
and then you had to do an interaction on the spider.

1006
00:43:28,725 --> 00:43:32,988
I didn't really love that, and so I proposed this.

1007
00:43:39,332 --> 00:43:41,113
This is what Cinemax looked like early on, by the way.

1008
00:43:43,608 --> 00:43:44,908
I'm gonna show you some little tastes of

1009
00:43:46,549 --> 00:43:48,049
pre-final version cinematics here,

1010
00:43:48,489 --> 00:43:49,190
but just small stuff.

1011
00:44:01,302 --> 00:44:03,904
So, the response to this, can we afford to add

1012
00:44:03,924 --> 00:44:05,946
a new cinematic between the two boss phases?

1013
00:44:06,766 --> 00:44:09,088
Can we support changing the collapse cinematic,

1014
00:44:09,108 --> 00:44:10,169
the one you just saw at the end?

1015
00:44:10,529 --> 00:44:11,950
These problems sort of solved themselves

1016
00:44:11,991 --> 00:44:14,372
because we shortened one and added a little bit to another.

1017
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:17,415
Are we going back to all the same problems we had before

1018
00:44:17,735 --> 00:44:19,977
with moving the weak points to be back on the spider?

1019
00:44:21,838 --> 00:44:23,179
Are we really gonna be able to deliver

1020
00:44:23,299 --> 00:44:24,720
true physics-driven simulations

1021
00:44:24,740 --> 00:44:26,021
of the spider's arms and wires?

1022
00:44:26,542 --> 00:44:26,942
We didn't know.

1023
00:44:28,728 --> 00:44:30,570
Here's a video of our first stab at rebuilding

1024
00:44:30,610 --> 00:44:33,033
the recluse chamber to the new cutting the strings concept.

1025
00:44:34,374 --> 00:44:36,937
Pretty early on, we realized that these coupling weak points

1026
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,559
on the strings were kind of problematic.

1027
00:44:39,059 --> 00:44:41,381
In my mind, these strings were always gonna be taut,

1028
00:44:41,461 --> 00:44:42,923
they were gonna be like pulled tight,

1029
00:44:43,464 --> 00:44:45,285
but in practice, you need some to be loose

1030
00:44:45,325 --> 00:44:46,066
and some to be tight,

1031
00:44:46,146 --> 00:44:48,809
and that made these weak points very wiggly.

1032
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:51,111
And that wasn't ideal.

1033
00:44:52,073 --> 00:44:55,238
But Marchant had built these really cool bracelets

1034
00:44:55,298 --> 00:44:57,702
on the spider to connect the arms to those wires.

1035
00:44:58,282 --> 00:44:59,264
And we had the idea of like,

1036
00:44:59,284 --> 00:45:01,547
hey, why don't we just make these bracelets

1037
00:45:01,628 --> 00:45:03,110
on the arms of the spider, the weak points.

1038
00:45:03,490 --> 00:45:04,392
So that's what you see here.

1039
00:45:07,969 --> 00:45:11,193
Also you see now the Eric has a full suite of abilities.

1040
00:45:11,273 --> 00:45:13,275
This is the combat design that came in from Charles,

1041
00:45:13,656 --> 00:45:14,477
combat design team.

1042
00:45:15,098 --> 00:45:16,760
This is our new phase transition cinematic.

1043
00:45:17,000 --> 00:45:18,281
This is a storyboard animatic.

1044
00:45:18,362 --> 00:45:20,224
That's what this, these are what cinematics look like

1045
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:23,187
before the thing you just saw before with a rough out.

1046
00:45:24,929 --> 00:45:26,071
Just thought it'd be cool to show you this

1047
00:45:26,091 --> 00:45:28,574
because we'll see the finished product in a little bit too.

1048
00:45:33,079 --> 00:45:34,800
Also very cool, in the cinematic here,

1049
00:45:34,860 --> 00:45:36,480
we show you exactly what you need to do.

1050
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,120
We actually use it to point out the gameplay.

1051
00:45:44,102 --> 00:45:45,562
Now we have these core cable weak points

1052
00:45:45,582 --> 00:45:48,403
that I was talking about on this final connector

1053
00:45:48,483 --> 00:45:50,384
hanging, connecting the spider to the ceiling.

1054
00:46:11,979 --> 00:46:13,600
Yeah, and then the cinematic for the collapse.

1055
00:46:18,501 --> 00:46:20,581
So, what else needed rework?

1056
00:46:22,062 --> 00:46:24,322
The shatter passage and the recluse boss reworks

1057
00:46:24,362 --> 00:46:25,583
were received very positively.

1058
00:46:26,083 --> 00:46:27,423
Something that had languished for a long time

1059
00:46:27,463 --> 00:46:29,924
was the swim escape, as we talked about earlier.

1060
00:46:30,584 --> 00:46:33,225
We finally received the first version of the specters,

1061
00:46:33,405 --> 00:46:34,685
so we could actually place them in the level.

1062
00:46:35,085 --> 00:46:36,026
They couldn't do anything,

1063
00:46:36,086 --> 00:46:37,426
but we actually could see how big they were,

1064
00:46:37,686 --> 00:46:39,246
and they were much bigger than I expected.

1065
00:46:40,775 --> 00:46:45,920
We also got some notes from our associate game director, Ray.

1066
00:46:46,600 --> 00:46:48,302
He wanted to add some new gameplay sections

1067
00:46:48,342 --> 00:46:49,062
to the swim escape.

1068
00:46:49,583 --> 00:46:51,504
So this is hard for you to read

1069
00:46:51,544 --> 00:46:53,246
compared to the versions we've seen before,

1070
00:46:53,286 --> 00:46:54,527
but there were some ideas in here

1071
00:46:54,587 --> 00:46:56,608
like an area where you have to swim

1072
00:46:56,649 --> 00:46:57,910
against the current that we added

1073
00:46:58,250 --> 00:47:00,191
and an initial swim through area that we added

1074
00:47:00,312 --> 00:47:01,733
that I'm gonna show you in the video here.

1075
00:47:02,894 --> 00:47:03,074
Next.

1076
00:47:04,302 --> 00:47:05,343
These are the Spectres, by the way.

1077
00:47:05,383 --> 00:47:06,485
We finally got these guys,

1078
00:47:06,625 --> 00:47:08,827
and this is just to give you a sense of perspective.

1079
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,230
They're huge, they're like a medium-sized machine.

1080
00:47:11,710 --> 00:47:12,852
I thought they were gonna be something

1081
00:47:12,912 --> 00:47:14,233
more like a small-sized machine,

1082
00:47:14,293 --> 00:47:16,195
and actually we got something the size of a Ravager.

1083
00:47:17,836 --> 00:47:20,617
So we reworked the swim escape with these ideas in mind.

1084
00:47:20,637 --> 00:47:22,198
I'm gonna point out these new areas.

1085
00:47:23,419 --> 00:47:24,859
This is the new swim through tunnel

1086
00:47:24,980 --> 00:47:26,300
that Ray had suggested we add.

1087
00:47:26,740 --> 00:47:29,262
The reason why we added this is we added this tunnel

1088
00:47:29,282 --> 00:47:31,563
because it's exactly the length required

1089
00:47:31,943 --> 00:47:33,744
to force you to use up all your oxygen.

1090
00:47:34,104 --> 00:47:36,185
And that would force you at the end of this swim section

1091
00:47:36,225 --> 00:47:37,986
to surface and see the specters.

1092
00:47:40,067 --> 00:47:40,147
Shit!

1093
00:47:40,167 --> 00:47:40,948
So here are our specters.

1094
00:47:41,288 --> 00:47:42,708
Just like our guys before, they're like,

1095
00:47:42,728 --> 00:47:44,049
ha ha, you're in water, I don't know what that is.

1096
00:47:44,069 --> 00:47:45,030
Oh, specters. I'm gonna stay out of them.

1097
00:47:48,464 --> 00:47:51,427
But as you can see, they don't really fit all that well

1098
00:47:51,487 --> 00:47:52,548
in this space anymore.

1099
00:47:52,908 --> 00:47:55,071
So we had to figure out a way to change

1100
00:47:55,111 --> 00:47:57,853
the structure of this upper area to accommodate them

1101
00:47:57,893 --> 00:47:58,614
as best we could.

1102
00:47:59,195 --> 00:48:03,098
Also, surprise, in the design, there

1103
00:48:03,118 --> 00:48:05,421
was this idea that they could walk on walls and ceilings,

1104
00:48:05,741 --> 00:48:08,704
which we didn't actually have any machines that did this.

1105
00:48:09,184 --> 00:48:11,907
And we didn't actually have some way to mock this up exactly.

1106
00:48:13,490 --> 00:48:14,531
And so we had to try to figure out

1107
00:48:14,571 --> 00:48:15,832
how we were gonna rebuild this space

1108
00:48:15,872 --> 00:48:17,093
to accommodate for these machines

1109
00:48:17,113 --> 00:48:18,334
that could cling to walls and ceilings.

1110
00:48:23,498 --> 00:48:25,439
So this is a new gauntlet section,

1111
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:26,400
much like the one before,

1112
00:48:26,440 --> 00:48:28,722
where you have to swim through an area at the end

1113
00:48:28,762 --> 00:48:30,063
while under fire and duress.

1114
00:48:30,443 --> 00:48:31,704
You'll see a better version of this later.

1115
00:48:34,526 --> 00:48:35,908
Yeah.

1116
00:48:35,968 --> 00:48:36,068
Okay.

1117
00:48:37,978 --> 00:48:40,679
A summary of what changed during the time of great change.

1118
00:48:41,099 --> 00:48:43,280
We completely reworked the main chamber of the bunker.

1119
00:48:43,660 --> 00:48:44,701
We cut the swim labs.

1120
00:48:44,881 --> 00:48:47,001
We reworked the boss fight with new weak points

1121
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,182
in the spider and proper combat design for the boss.

1122
00:48:49,582 --> 00:48:51,123
We redesigned the swim escape section

1123
00:48:51,143 --> 00:48:52,783
with new gameplay segments and in a way

1124
00:48:52,823 --> 00:48:54,304
to accommodate the larger than planned

1125
00:48:54,324 --> 00:48:55,464
for size of the specters.

1126
00:48:56,825 --> 00:48:58,325
On to finishing touches.

1127
00:48:58,565 --> 00:49:00,446
This is sort of like our polish phase.

1128
00:49:01,106 --> 00:49:01,726
However,

1129
00:49:02,802 --> 00:49:05,264
Because of large reworks during the phase before this,

1130
00:49:05,304 --> 00:49:08,066
we had to do new art integration late in the process.

1131
00:49:08,586 --> 00:49:12,529
That led to late lighting passes, late audio passes,

1132
00:49:12,590 --> 00:49:15,192
late everything passes, and this was very, very difficult.

1133
00:49:16,112 --> 00:49:18,474
Traversal gameplay iteration in response to gameplay,

1134
00:49:18,875 --> 00:49:22,237
we had to do a lot of this because traversal problems

1135
00:49:22,457 --> 00:49:24,399
cause players fits in playtesting.

1136
00:49:24,519 --> 00:49:25,800
If they can't make one jump,

1137
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:27,462
they can't progress in the level.

1138
00:49:27,782 --> 00:49:28,863
And we were trying to do everything

1139
00:49:28,943 --> 00:49:31,925
on a very fine level of perfection.

1140
00:49:33,427 --> 00:49:35,209
Boss battle tweaks in response to playtesting.

1141
00:49:36,430 --> 00:49:37,952
A custom server door behavior scripting

1142
00:49:38,152 --> 00:49:40,075
to support SwimEscape, talk more about that later.

1143
00:49:40,615 --> 00:49:41,757
And finally, bug fixing.

1144
00:49:43,859 --> 00:49:46,903
So, in iterating and doing new art passes

1145
00:49:46,943 --> 00:49:48,565
on the main chamber, like I said,

1146
00:49:48,825 --> 00:49:50,367
because we completely reworked everything,

1147
00:49:51,008 --> 00:49:53,151
we had to work hard to catch up on lost time.

1148
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:56,171
This caused our scores to dip in playtests

1149
00:49:56,231 --> 00:49:58,153
for quite some time, because we no longer

1150
00:49:58,193 --> 00:49:59,414
had the fidelity we had before.

1151
00:49:59,994 --> 00:50:01,336
A more traversal-oriented space

1152
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,697
suffered more readability issues.

1153
00:50:03,537 --> 00:50:05,599
Small snags in players' ability to move through the space

1154
00:50:05,659 --> 00:50:07,240
caused huge dips in player scores.

1155
00:50:07,561 --> 00:50:09,422
Just as an example, we had one playtest

1156
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:11,464
where ladders stopped working.

1157
00:50:11,984 --> 00:50:13,866
And when you can't use the ladders to climb back up,

1158
00:50:14,206 --> 00:50:15,708
players get massively frustrated.

1159
00:50:17,049 --> 00:50:18,490
In less than a year, we went from this,

1160
00:50:18,510 --> 00:50:19,731
to this,

1161
00:50:19,751 --> 00:50:20,051
to this.

1162
00:50:24,223 --> 00:50:26,604
and every version calls players fits in different ways.

1163
00:50:27,565 --> 00:50:28,365
Let me show you a video.

1164
00:50:29,885 --> 00:50:31,986
So this is a video of our playtesters

1165
00:50:32,226 --> 00:50:33,787
experiencing some common problems

1166
00:50:33,907 --> 00:50:35,207
in trying to traverse through the space.

1167
00:50:35,687 --> 00:50:36,848
What's going on here is this player

1168
00:50:36,868 --> 00:50:38,728
doesn't remember how to jump backwards anymore.

1169
00:50:38,988 --> 00:50:40,909
That's a thing we just don't ask you to do that often.

1170
00:50:41,769 --> 00:50:43,010
And the way I designed this platform,

1171
00:50:43,030 --> 00:50:44,810
it was really hard to actually land the jump.

1172
00:50:46,836 --> 00:50:48,457
So what I did is we added a reminder.

1173
00:50:48,497 --> 00:50:50,097
This is an idea we stole from God of War

1174
00:50:50,117 --> 00:50:52,138
where we pop these things up in the bottom of the screen

1175
00:50:52,258 --> 00:50:54,299
contextually if we felt like you needed a reminder

1176
00:50:54,319 --> 00:50:55,159
of how to do something.

1177
00:50:57,860 --> 00:51:00,561
Here, we had this pullable vent that you had to open up

1178
00:51:00,601 --> 00:51:01,581
to enter this room.

1179
00:51:02,261 --> 00:51:04,442
In the block mesh, people saw it perfectly

1180
00:51:04,482 --> 00:51:06,423
but with lighting, they never saw it.

1181
00:51:06,843 --> 00:51:08,264
They never saw that vent.

1182
00:51:12,065 --> 00:51:13,826
So David McMullin, one of our designers,

1183
00:51:13,866 --> 00:51:15,266
he had the brilliant idea just to open it.

1184
00:51:15,286 --> 00:51:16,367
Mike.

1185
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,401
If people don't see it, just open it up, man.

1186
00:51:19,861 --> 00:51:20,881
Then it's in your field of view.

1187
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:24,742
Door's locked.

1188
00:51:27,042 --> 00:51:29,062
So this section, I was talking a little bit about it earlier.

1189
00:51:29,102 --> 00:51:31,403
This is the moment right before the shield glide.

1190
00:51:31,903 --> 00:51:34,684
We had this problem here where players did not want

1191
00:51:34,784 --> 00:51:38,204
to jump into range to pull themselves to a grapple point.

1192
00:51:38,644 --> 00:51:39,304
It scared them.

1193
00:51:40,185 --> 00:51:41,545
So players would open this thing up

1194
00:51:41,645 --> 00:51:44,065
and then they would just hop up and down in one spot,

1195
00:51:45,206 --> 00:51:47,186
hoping that the grapple tool would kick in.

1196
00:51:48,753 --> 00:51:50,874
So we had to add some self-talk lines.

1197
00:51:50,914 --> 00:51:52,715
We had to add some player direction.

1198
00:52:14,862 --> 00:52:17,023
Don't think my pole caster can latch onto that from here.

1199
00:52:18,374 --> 00:52:19,254
I'm gonna have to jump.

1200
00:52:27,137 --> 00:52:32,279
This is another example where he added a reminder because players forgot that they could drop down off of a climbing hold.

1201
00:52:32,899 --> 00:52:34,479
It also felt very scary to them.

1202
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:43,883
How am I supposed to get to that? Am I supposed to...

1203
00:52:45,423 --> 00:52:46,503
Do you want me to drop down?

1204
00:52:48,332 --> 00:52:49,352
Jesus Christ.

1205
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:53,255
I don't know if I can digest it, but...

1206
00:53:14,652 --> 00:53:18,194
There was this moment right at the end of the level where there is a pull-enabled grapple

1207
00:53:18,254 --> 00:53:22,696
point and right here at the end we wanted you to actually, we wanted to complicate the

1208
00:53:22,716 --> 00:53:25,978
climb a little bit so you needed to go to the right here instead of just going straight

1209
00:53:26,038 --> 00:53:26,139
up.

1210
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:31,682
Please, I just want this quest to be over.

1211
00:53:32,542 --> 00:53:33,043
Why won't...

1212
00:53:34,584 --> 00:53:35,664
What do I need to do?

1213
00:53:35,684 --> 00:53:37,225
Come on.

1214
00:53:39,407 --> 00:53:40,747
Okay, right there?

1215
00:53:42,709 --> 00:53:43,949
Okay, so much for the...

1216
00:53:43,969 --> 00:53:44,370
Okay, so much for the...

1217
00:53:45,455 --> 00:53:46,955
So I was like, look, fine, okay,

1218
00:53:46,995 --> 00:53:48,596
I'm just gonna put the climbing points

1219
00:53:48,656 --> 00:53:49,937
right above the grapple point.

1220
00:53:55,379 --> 00:53:56,700
Player wanna go up, we go up.

1221
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,502
Okay, so much for the flooded maze.

1222
00:54:02,463 --> 00:54:02,903
I made it.

1223
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:04,804
And last but not least.

1224
00:54:04,824 --> 00:54:05,684
That doesn't seem realistic.

1225
00:54:05,704 --> 00:54:07,985
Why is there an obstacle course

1226
00:54:08,005 --> 00:54:09,146
to get to someone's office?

1227
00:54:09,766 --> 00:54:10,347
Unrealistic.

1228
00:54:13,050 --> 00:54:15,552
Okay, I don't really care that much.

1229
00:54:16,052 --> 00:54:16,612
Fire gleam.

1230
00:54:16,812 --> 00:54:18,193
This is the real fire gleam you see.

1231
00:54:24,336 --> 00:54:29,339
Uncool.

1232
00:54:29,399 --> 00:54:30,299
So to prevent this,

1233
00:54:30,460 --> 00:54:32,461
which I actually didn't really want to change,

1234
00:54:32,541 --> 00:54:33,861
but to prevent this,

1235
00:54:33,921 --> 00:54:35,702
I actually added guardrails behind you.

1236
00:54:35,802 --> 00:54:37,743
So if you get hit by this thing, it would catch you.

1237
00:54:42,721 --> 00:54:43,201
Careful.

1238
00:54:46,422 --> 00:54:49,263
So, feedback received on the cutting the strings changes

1239
00:54:49,303 --> 00:54:49,903
in playtesting.

1240
00:54:50,503 --> 00:54:53,164
The tension between needing to split your attention

1241
00:54:53,184 --> 00:54:54,685
between the recluse and the boss seemed to work

1242
00:54:54,765 --> 00:54:55,325
fundamentally.

1243
00:54:55,805 --> 00:54:57,565
Players needed a lot of help hitting the weak points,

1244
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:58,566
so we added a lot of magnets.

1245
00:54:59,146 --> 00:55:00,826
And Eric needed just the right amount of chill.

1246
00:55:00,866 --> 00:55:02,467
If he was too aggressive, it was too hard.

1247
00:55:02,527 --> 00:55:03,947
If he was too light, it wasn't good.

1248
00:55:04,468 --> 00:55:06,348
So we took a long time to balance him.

1249
00:55:07,388 --> 00:55:09,169
We also added a new step that I want to show you.

1250
00:55:11,048 --> 00:55:17,650
So Matthias again, he thought it was weird that the weak points on the spider arm showed up just at the beginning of the boss battle for no good reason.

1251
00:55:18,050 --> 00:55:24,932
So he requested that we add this step where you actually had to walk over or run over to this console at the beginning of the room and activate it.

1252
00:55:25,012 --> 00:55:27,573
And that would make the weak points show up the first time on the spider.

1253
00:55:29,593 --> 00:55:33,675
Also, nice little touch. Once you activate this thing, Eric gets mad at you and he blows it up.

1254
00:55:37,252 --> 00:55:39,173
So as you can see, this has an art pass now, right?

1255
00:55:39,213 --> 00:55:41,935
Like it's actually like, this is the finished version.

1256
00:55:41,995 --> 00:55:43,636
So this is with art, with lighting,

1257
00:55:43,996 --> 00:55:48,319
the proper weak points that glow and change, the full boss.

1258
00:55:57,305 --> 00:55:58,966
And this is that phase transition sequence,

1259
00:55:58,986 --> 00:56:00,287
the one that you saw as a storyboard,

1260
00:56:00,347 --> 00:56:01,368
but the finished version.

1261
00:56:15,364 --> 00:56:15,544
Right.

1262
00:56:20,445 --> 00:56:20,625
Okay.

1263
00:56:21,906 --> 00:56:23,647
So, lastly, the specters.

1264
00:56:25,027 --> 00:56:27,008
Now we actually have the specters in the level,

1265
00:56:27,088 --> 00:56:28,568
but we had to get them to do things.

1266
00:56:29,389 --> 00:56:30,989
So we need to figure out well clinging,

1267
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:34,250
precision scanning, like the turrets I was talking about,

1268
00:56:34,631 --> 00:56:36,451
shooting from the walls and detecting the player.

1269
00:56:36,811 --> 00:56:38,332
These are actually all new behaviors.

1270
00:56:38,372 --> 00:56:39,752
We hadn't done this stuff before.

1271
00:56:40,273 --> 00:56:41,473
There are machines in the first game

1272
00:56:41,493 --> 00:56:42,633
that appear to cling to walls,

1273
00:56:42,793 --> 00:56:43,994
but it's a bit of an illusion.

1274
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,116
They can start that way, but then they have to come right down off the wall.

1275
00:56:47,396 --> 00:56:51,538
This was the first machine that could actually move from walls to ceilings and then shoot

1276
00:56:51,598 --> 00:56:52,499
from those positions.

1277
00:56:53,379 --> 00:56:56,641
These are videos provided by Tommy Kirsten, one of our AI programmers that worked with

1278
00:56:56,661 --> 00:56:57,242
me on this area.

1279
00:56:57,862 --> 00:57:01,564
He also built custom behaviors for me where I could indicate areas where they would fire

1280
00:57:01,604 --> 00:57:05,026
and strafing patterns because we wanted that during this section as well.

1281
00:57:09,493 --> 00:57:11,755
And lastly, there is a custom scanning behavior,

1282
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:12,815
which is what you see here.

1283
00:57:13,296 --> 00:57:14,817
I could give them an array of points,

1284
00:57:15,197 --> 00:57:16,818
and they would move their field of view,

1285
00:57:16,858 --> 00:57:18,599
their view cone, from point to point,

1286
00:57:18,919 --> 00:57:20,500
changing the direction of this spotlight

1287
00:57:20,540 --> 00:57:21,740
to show you where that they were looking.

1288
00:57:23,682 --> 00:57:25,042
So, let me show you what that looks like

1289
00:57:25,062 --> 00:57:25,843
in the finished version.

1290
00:57:27,083 --> 00:57:28,824
Again, full art pass, full lighting pass.

1291
00:57:42,882 --> 00:57:44,863
Shit! There might be a way under this.

1292
00:58:06,258 --> 00:58:07,318
So, to summarize...

1293
00:58:09,528 --> 00:58:11,190
What did we do during finishing touches?

1294
00:58:11,250 --> 00:58:13,531
We integrated new art and lighting passes

1295
00:58:13,571 --> 00:58:14,392
in a single phase.

1296
00:58:15,052 --> 00:58:17,194
We did tons of iteration on traversal gameplay

1297
00:58:17,234 --> 00:58:18,114
based on playtesting.

1298
00:58:18,455 --> 00:58:19,655
We iterated on the boss fight.

1299
00:58:20,096 --> 00:58:22,297
We implemented a bunch of new custom AI behavior

1300
00:58:22,337 --> 00:58:23,738
for the specters in the swim escape.

1301
00:58:24,739 --> 00:58:26,260
And the feedback received in the playtests,

1302
00:58:26,440 --> 00:58:28,341
I'm happy to say in our final appeals test,

1303
00:58:28,661 --> 00:58:31,063
this was one of the highest scoring quests in the game.

1304
00:58:31,563 --> 00:58:34,305
We got up to a nice high score.

1305
00:58:37,648 --> 00:58:40,709
So, let me try to draw some conclusions for you.

1306
00:58:42,509 --> 00:58:44,150
How do I summarize four years of my life?

1307
00:58:45,170 --> 00:58:47,511
I started this journey the moment I stepped off the plane

1308
00:58:47,551 --> 00:58:48,511
from my last GDC.

1309
00:58:48,791 --> 00:58:50,552
I gave my last talk, I flew home,

1310
00:58:50,612 --> 00:58:51,753
and I started building this quest.

1311
00:58:53,233 --> 00:58:55,054
And I fixed bugs on it before I came here.

1312
00:58:55,354 --> 00:58:56,854
So, the whole time.

1313
00:58:57,795 --> 00:58:59,675
I worked on this quest in parallel with six others

1314
00:58:59,935 --> 00:59:00,636
during the development.

1315
00:59:00,976 --> 00:59:01,836
That was very hard.

1316
00:59:02,816 --> 00:59:04,057
But I was able to bring work back

1317
00:59:04,097 --> 00:59:05,077
from those quests to this one.

1318
00:59:06,400 --> 00:59:09,283
I've never been asked to change a level design so dramatically,

1319
00:59:09,643 --> 00:59:12,826
but I've taken smaller changes with less grace in the past.

1320
00:59:13,846 --> 00:59:16,228
I'm glad I'm better equipped for that now as a designer

1321
00:59:16,348 --> 00:59:16,969
and as a person.

1322
00:59:18,470 --> 00:59:20,212
Making this quest was not only challenging,

1323
00:59:20,252 --> 00:59:22,994
but life too was tremendously challenging during this period

1324
00:59:23,534 --> 00:59:24,155
for all of us.

1325
00:59:26,176 --> 00:59:26,577
Takeaways.

1326
00:59:28,198 --> 00:59:29,839
Have clarity on the story you're telling.

1327
00:59:30,613 --> 00:59:34,434
Though this quest changed a lot, the story we were telling remained relatively consistent

1328
00:59:34,634 --> 00:59:36,274
after the initial documentation phase.

1329
00:59:37,775 --> 00:59:42,676
Aim for your early designs to be representative and readable more so than beautiful or elegant

1330
00:59:42,816 --> 00:59:43,196
or fun.

1331
00:59:43,716 --> 00:59:45,536
This will save you both time and heartache.

1332
00:59:46,877 --> 00:59:51,398
When introducing or reintroducing a complex mechanic or concept, start with a small, easy

1333
00:59:51,438 --> 00:59:51,838
example.

1334
00:59:52,018 --> 00:59:53,358
Remember the idea of the nugget.

1335
00:59:55,054 --> 00:59:57,975
Be aware that when the larger design of the game shifts around your level

1336
00:59:58,395 --> 01:00:00,996
in a way that may require your level to accommodate those changes,

1337
01:00:01,296 --> 01:00:02,536
you have to embrace those changes.

1338
01:00:03,456 --> 01:00:06,677
In the game, we didn't have the shield wing as a thing that you got

1339
01:00:06,717 --> 01:00:08,238
as part of the main quest for a long time.

1340
01:00:08,278 --> 01:00:11,079
It was actually an optional piece of equipment you got in a side quest.

1341
01:00:11,839 --> 01:00:13,619
But once we actually moved it into the main quest,

1342
01:00:13,759 --> 01:00:16,880
we knew that we had to add it into this quest as a thing that you could use.

1343
01:00:18,808 --> 01:00:20,390
When tasked to explore big change,

1344
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:22,553
make sure you understand the goals and limitations

1345
01:00:22,593 --> 01:00:23,795
defined by the gatekeeper,

1346
01:00:24,115 --> 01:00:26,599
and then sell those just as hard as the new idea.

1347
01:00:27,480 --> 01:00:28,982
If the people you're selling the idea to

1348
01:00:29,062 --> 01:00:31,085
understand the goals and limitations as well as you,

1349
01:00:31,425 --> 01:00:34,009
they'll know why your well-crafted idea

1350
01:00:34,129 --> 01:00:34,990
is the right solution.

1351
01:00:36,442 --> 01:00:38,745
And lastly, good ideas are like boomerangs.

1352
01:00:39,185 --> 01:00:41,628
Even when you throw them away, they often come back.

1353
01:00:42,429 --> 01:00:44,271
Looking at the earliest version of this quest,

1354
01:00:44,311 --> 01:00:46,453
the skeleton quest, you can see that there are,

1355
01:00:46,834 --> 01:00:48,055
the version of the boss fight there

1356
01:00:48,135 --> 01:00:50,197
is actually more similar to what we shipped

1357
01:00:50,277 --> 01:00:51,539
than some of the versions in the middle.

1358
01:00:52,760 --> 01:00:53,841
The ideas just came back.

1359
01:00:54,202 --> 01:00:55,123
Think about the swim labs.

1360
01:00:55,443 --> 01:00:57,285
We cut them, but they came back in another place.

1361
01:00:59,908 --> 01:01:02,729
Acknowledgements, thank you to everyone at Gorilla

1362
01:01:02,989 --> 01:01:04,330
and all the people that I worked with

1363
01:01:04,450 --> 01:01:05,270
on building this level.

1364
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,751
It was a tremendous effort.

1365
01:01:07,651 --> 01:01:08,991
Here's my contact information.

1366
01:01:09,072 --> 01:01:10,312
If you guys wanna email me,

1367
01:01:10,432 --> 01:01:11,973
if you guys wanna DM me or whatever,

1368
01:01:12,313 --> 01:01:13,093
you totally can.

1369
01:01:13,133 --> 01:01:15,134
I'm happy to answer questions if I'm able to.

1370
01:01:16,844 --> 01:01:17,965
We don't have time for QA

1371
01:01:17,985 --> 01:01:19,606
because we are officially out of time here,

1372
01:01:20,047 --> 01:01:23,229
but I am going to go immediately to the wrap-up space.

1373
01:01:23,590 --> 01:01:24,550
You can just follow me.

1374
01:01:24,971 --> 01:01:26,232
I'm happy to answer questions

1375
01:01:26,292 --> 01:01:27,833
for as long as you guys have them.

1376
01:01:28,434 --> 01:01:29,354
I'm not trying to shut you out.

1377
01:01:29,374 --> 01:01:31,216
I just wanted to show you as much as I possibly could.

1378
01:01:32,056 --> 01:01:32,737
Thank you very much.

1379
01:01:32,757 --> 01:01:34,138
Thank you.

1380
01:01:34,298 --> 01:01:34,859
Thank you.

1381
01:01:34,999 --> 01:01:35,339
Thank you.

1382
01:01:35,359 --> 01:01:35,880
Thank you.

1383
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:36,300
Thank you.

1384
01:01:36,580 --> 01:01:37,081
Thank you.

1385
01:01:37,301 --> 01:01:41,064
Thank you.

1386
01:01:41,084 --> 01:01:41,264
Thank you.

1387
01:01:41,284 --> 01:01:41,464
Thank you.

1388
01:01:41,484 --> 01:01:41,664
Thank you.

1389
01:01:41,684 --> 01:01:41,864
Thank you.

1390
01:01:41,884 --> 01:01:42,145
Thank you.

1391
01:01:42,165 --> 01:01:42,405
Thank you.

1392
01:01:42,425 --> 01:01:43,206
Thank you.

1393
01:01:43,226 --> 01:01:43,406
Thank you.

1394
01:01:43,426 --> 01:01:43,606
Thank you.
