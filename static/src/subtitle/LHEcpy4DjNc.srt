1
00:00:05,972 --> 00:00:07,032
Good morning, everyone.

2
00:00:07,232 --> 00:00:08,833
So I hope you slept well.

3
00:00:09,473 --> 00:00:10,694
I know I didn't.

4
00:00:12,975 --> 00:00:16,997
So today I'm here to talk to you about Emergence

5
00:00:17,157 --> 00:00:20,539
and how we applied it to our AI in Watch Dogs 2.

6
00:00:20,599 --> 00:00:23,760
So who the hell am I?

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,521
Background check.

8
00:00:25,601 --> 00:00:27,662
I am a AI designer at Ubisoft.

9
00:00:27,702 --> 00:00:29,643
I've been working there for about two years.

10
00:00:30,403 --> 00:00:31,424
We just shipped Watch Dogs 2.

11
00:00:32,336 --> 00:00:36,357
and before that I was in other studios working on these cute brands.

12
00:00:38,878 --> 00:00:45,260
So let's start by giving you some context on why emergence is important for Watch Dogs 2

13
00:00:45,901 --> 00:00:49,522
and the intention of our team with this.

14
00:00:50,662 --> 00:00:53,583
So why emergence and why is it relevant for AI?

15
00:00:57,443 --> 00:00:59,224
Like as many of you might know,

16
00:01:00,465 --> 00:01:02,866
emergence is something, when something new is created

17
00:01:02,967 --> 00:01:06,289
from the interaction of many entities or systems,

18
00:01:07,389 --> 00:01:11,292
and we think it helps make your agent look more intelligent,

19
00:01:12,493 --> 00:01:15,795
and it helps them to be more interesting for the player

20
00:01:15,875 --> 00:01:17,416
to watch and interact with them.

21
00:01:17,996 --> 00:01:20,538
It's also something we think leverage

22
00:01:20,798 --> 00:01:22,439
any kind of sandbox gameplay.

23
00:01:25,461 --> 00:01:25,641
So.

24
00:01:26,286 --> 00:01:29,487
I'll start by giving you some under the hood knowledge

25
00:01:29,607 --> 00:01:31,668
about how we did it.

26
00:01:32,668 --> 00:01:34,449
Then I'll talk about the experience

27
00:01:34,529 --> 00:01:36,590
and what we got from it and what we learned.

28
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:40,711
And after that, I'll go with what we want to do next

29
00:01:40,771 --> 00:01:43,892
with this and some words on the results we got.

30
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:50,675
So for those of you that played Watch Dogs 1,

31
00:01:51,855 --> 00:01:54,396
the game is set in Chicago.

32
00:01:55,638 --> 00:01:58,199
Our protagonist is Aiden Pierce.

33
00:01:59,179 --> 00:02:02,081
He's a vigilante set on a vendetta.

34
00:02:02,161 --> 00:02:03,842
So it's a really dark game.

35
00:02:03,862 --> 00:02:05,302
It has a really serious tone.

36
00:02:06,263 --> 00:02:09,464
And the relationship between Aiden and the civilians

37
00:02:09,984 --> 00:02:13,086
was mostly one of fear and collateral damage.

38
00:02:16,647 --> 00:02:22,032
For Watch Dogs 2, we wanted to give more meaningful interaction with the civilians,

39
00:02:22,572 --> 00:02:24,434
and we had the perfect city to do it.

40
00:02:25,235 --> 00:02:27,657
It's set in San Francisco, and as you might know,

41
00:02:28,597 --> 00:02:31,180
San Francisco is full of colorful and interesting people.

42
00:02:32,020 --> 00:02:36,044
So we wanted also to give the player the impression that the world was living by itself,

43
00:02:36,624 --> 00:02:41,348
and not necessarily just by his interaction or his input.

44
00:02:44,117 --> 00:02:46,677
So we created what we call an anecdote factory.

45
00:02:47,598 --> 00:02:51,739
The idea behind this is to create a small narrative story

46
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,020
that are emergent and that can surprise the player

47
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:58,361
as he's playing the game and can maybe stop

48
00:02:58,401 --> 00:03:00,982
and watch the civilians and be interested

49
00:03:01,022 --> 00:03:01,722
in what they are doing.

50
00:03:04,923 --> 00:03:07,204
As one of our creative directors once said,

51
00:03:09,068 --> 00:03:11,329
We should know how it starts, but never how it ends.

52
00:03:11,609 --> 00:03:14,250
And this became really our motto for the rest of the project.

53
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,291
So for those of you that didn't play the game yet,

54
00:03:18,491 --> 00:03:21,251
or that don't remember, I'll show you a bit

55
00:03:21,771 --> 00:03:22,892
how it looks in the game.

56
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:29,853
Just a note, this video was discovered,

57
00:03:29,993 --> 00:03:32,014
well, this situation, this specific scenario,

58
00:03:32,034 --> 00:03:33,354
was discovered by a YouTuber.

59
00:03:34,034 --> 00:03:35,594
We recreated with cheats.

60
00:03:36,862 --> 00:03:39,303
But normally for a player, it won't be easy

61
00:03:39,344 --> 00:03:40,965
to have exactly the same situation.

62
00:03:42,426 --> 00:03:43,827
But for copyright's reason,

63
00:03:43,867 --> 00:03:45,388
we couldn't show the YouTube video.

64
00:03:45,408 --> 00:03:48,891
Oh my God, really?

65
00:03:49,371 --> 00:03:50,452
You really wanna get married?

66
00:03:50,492 --> 00:03:52,954
However, you really want to?

67
00:03:52,974 --> 00:03:53,354
Don't push me!

68
00:03:53,394 --> 00:03:55,316
Hey, I told you to shut up!

69
00:03:56,877 --> 00:03:57,538
Piss off!

70
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,519
You two are our favorite folks in the world.

71
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:01,421
Man, that's gross.

72
00:04:01,481 --> 00:04:02,561
Get a hold of yourself.

73
00:04:04,336 --> 00:04:06,298
No one cares about anybody but themselves.

74
00:04:06,838 --> 00:04:07,999
So fuck you!

75
00:04:10,481 --> 00:04:11,161
You stupid!

76
00:04:12,282 --> 00:04:14,804
I said, excuse me, but you think your shit don't stink?

77
00:04:15,064 --> 00:04:17,566
Are you gonna walk away and pretend you didn't do a damn thing?

78
00:04:17,766 --> 00:04:19,247
You insulted me!

79
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:24,491
And so what? I'm supposed to let everyone walk all over me?

80
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,572
I'm supposed to take it?

81
00:04:25,812 --> 00:04:27,553
I'm not the one who's on balance. You are!

82
00:04:27,573 --> 00:04:28,214
Do you hear me?

83
00:04:28,454 --> 00:04:28,774
Alright.

84
00:04:31,843 --> 00:04:36,567
So as you could see, there was a wedding proposal

85
00:04:36,767 --> 00:04:39,249
and a marriage proposal and the player decided

86
00:04:39,289 --> 00:04:42,191
to take a picture of it and one of the two guys

87
00:04:42,211 --> 00:04:43,312
decided to photobomb him.

88
00:04:44,433 --> 00:04:46,274
And the other were really insulted by this.

89
00:04:50,257 --> 00:04:53,800
Okay, so I'm certain you want to know more about

90
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:56,122
how we did it and what's under the hood.

91
00:04:57,323 --> 00:05:00,225
So there's three main systems that are really important

92
00:05:00,325 --> 00:05:01,486
for our civilians.

93
00:05:02,714 --> 00:05:04,955
We have attractor system, dynamic attractors,

94
00:05:05,175 --> 00:05:06,295
and the reaction system.

95
00:05:06,996 --> 00:05:09,196
I'll mainly focus on the reaction system

96
00:05:09,276 --> 00:05:11,497
because this is the main vector of emergence

97
00:05:11,677 --> 00:05:14,898
in Watch Dogs 2, but I'll talk a bit

98
00:05:14,938 --> 00:05:16,679
about the particularities of each one.

99
00:05:18,279 --> 00:05:20,500
So attractors are small activities

100
00:05:20,540 --> 00:05:21,840
that happen all around the city.

101
00:05:22,521 --> 00:05:30,163
They are scripted, and they are mainly game object

102
00:05:30,203 --> 00:05:31,603
we put in the game manually.

103
00:05:32,109 --> 00:05:35,750
and that can attract either pedestrian or spawn

104
00:05:35,770 --> 00:05:36,771
with their own actors.

105
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:40,452
This is really common in open world games.

106
00:05:40,572 --> 00:05:41,653
Most of them have them.

107
00:05:41,793 --> 00:05:44,153
So I won't spend a lot of time on this.

108
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:48,055
We do have dynamic attractors as well.

109
00:05:49,095 --> 00:05:51,316
This is pretty much the same principle,

110
00:05:51,356 --> 00:05:56,738
but it can spawn emergently through an event manager.

111
00:05:59,245 --> 00:06:02,106
It will pick either a two pedestrian or a pedestrian

112
00:06:02,146 --> 00:06:03,907
and a dynamic object such as a car.

113
00:06:05,027 --> 00:06:08,308
And it allows us to create situations

114
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,509
such as two people greeting each other or little crime scenes

115
00:06:11,569 --> 00:06:15,150
where a thief might pick your wallet and run

116
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:16,010
and stuff like that.

117
00:06:19,771 --> 00:06:21,251
And then we have the reaction system.

118
00:06:22,792 --> 00:06:24,372
This is a stimuli-based system.

119
00:06:24,412 --> 00:06:26,653
The idea behind this is to be not too costly

120
00:06:26,693 --> 00:06:26,993
because.

121
00:06:27,488 --> 00:06:29,389
We don't want our civilians to cost too much.

122
00:06:31,751 --> 00:06:35,513
It allows us to create emergent chain reaction, which

123
00:06:35,613 --> 00:06:39,336
is how we create the emergence scenario.

124
00:06:40,177 --> 00:06:41,578
And it's completely systemic.

125
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,718
We don't script any of this.

126
00:06:42,798 --> 00:06:45,440
We just have stimuli and behavior and reaction.

127
00:06:47,822 --> 00:06:49,803
So the general flow of this system,

128
00:06:51,284 --> 00:06:52,625
NPC will receive a stimulus.

129
00:06:53,526 --> 00:06:55,607
It will take a decision based on many criteria.

130
00:06:56,697 --> 00:06:58,378
and it will take a behavior from a list

131
00:06:58,878 --> 00:07:00,779
or choose to ignore the stimulus entirely.

132
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:03,980
So our stim propagate this way.

133
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:07,421
Let's say someone is playing a guitar,

134
00:07:07,521 --> 00:07:08,982
it will send a stim around him,

135
00:07:09,622 --> 00:07:12,844
telling the other agents that he's playing guitar.

136
00:07:13,644 --> 00:07:15,885
Someone might decide to mock him

137
00:07:16,065 --> 00:07:17,846
and say he's bad at playing guitar,

138
00:07:18,346 --> 00:07:21,187
and we send another stim to other civilians around

139
00:07:21,267 --> 00:07:22,087
so they might know.

140
00:07:23,266 --> 00:07:25,908
And two other agents might decide to accompany it

141
00:07:26,028 --> 00:07:28,970
and maybe observe the scene because they are amused by it

142
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,411
or take a picture, for instance.

143
00:07:31,112 --> 00:07:34,715
And they will send stems and it goes on like that.

144
00:07:37,237 --> 00:07:40,239
For the decision making, we use logic rules

145
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:41,880
based on fuzzy logic.

146
00:07:42,841 --> 00:07:45,543
So pretty much, we create really generic rules

147
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,225
that will fit most of the situation,

148
00:07:48,805 --> 00:07:51,107
but we can specify.

149
00:07:51,618 --> 00:07:56,421
the role as much as we want to go with really contextual situations.

150
00:07:57,181 --> 00:08:01,083
So for instance, if I'm walking and I see someone insulting someone else,

151
00:08:01,704 --> 00:08:05,246
I might decide to just ignore it entirely because it doesn't concern me.

152
00:08:05,626 --> 00:08:09,848
I might decide to observe the scene and I might decide to flee because I'm uncomfortable with this.

153
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:14,791
But if the target of the insult is one of my friends,

154
00:08:15,791 --> 00:08:19,313
then I might stop and observe. I will probably not ignore it.

155
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,040
I might fight for my friend or I might decide to flee anyway

156
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,901
because I know this friend is up to no good.

157
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:33,002
But then if the aggressor of my friend

158
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:35,482
is someone, one of my personal enemy,

159
00:08:35,982 --> 00:08:38,003
then I'll probably stand up and fight for my friend

160
00:08:38,063 --> 00:08:41,243
no matter what because this asshole won't get away with it.

161
00:08:41,643 --> 00:08:43,744
So the most precise is the role.

162
00:08:43,764 --> 00:08:47,344
This is just an example, but the more precise is the role,

163
00:08:47,364 --> 00:08:48,825
the more it has chance to be picked.

164
00:08:49,967 --> 00:08:51,087
if all the criteria are true.

165
00:08:54,208 --> 00:08:56,328
So how our behavior are structured

166
00:08:57,929 --> 00:08:59,129
after the decision making.

167
00:09:00,329 --> 00:09:02,530
First we always start with a reaction.

168
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:06,891
Reaction is really to get an acknowledgement of,

169
00:09:07,511 --> 00:09:10,191
oh, I saw something, or oh, I heard something.

170
00:09:11,812 --> 00:09:14,933
Then we have a phase where the agent will orient

171
00:09:15,133 --> 00:09:18,153
and move to a proper distance to display their behavior.

172
00:09:19,147 --> 00:09:21,387
and then they will display their core behavior.

173
00:09:21,867 --> 00:09:25,329
We always have an exit to return to

174
00:09:25,489 --> 00:09:26,889
whatever they were doing before.

175
00:09:27,729 --> 00:09:32,251
And the way we break down our behavior structure,

176
00:09:33,471 --> 00:09:36,232
it was really intentional to make it really clear

177
00:09:36,292 --> 00:09:39,873
for the player, it could read what the agents were doing.

178
00:09:41,194 --> 00:09:42,654
Otherwise it was really unclear.

179
00:09:45,235 --> 00:09:45,575
So let...

180
00:09:45,904 --> 00:09:46,725
break this down.

181
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:49,987
So the reaction is really just a short animation.

182
00:09:50,447 --> 00:09:52,028
It's usually a stance transition

183
00:09:52,088 --> 00:09:54,929
between sitting down or turning around.

184
00:09:55,970 --> 00:09:58,372
And it will have a little generic bark,

185
00:09:58,492 --> 00:10:00,513
so uh, or what?

186
00:10:01,433 --> 00:10:02,174
And stuff like that.

187
00:10:02,654 --> 00:10:04,055
We also have pure reactions.

188
00:10:04,155 --> 00:10:04,775
Some of our,

189
00:10:07,665 --> 00:10:10,047
of our rules call for pure reactions.

190
00:10:10,127 --> 00:10:13,168
So basically, any time we don't need to move

191
00:10:13,328 --> 00:10:15,449
or we don't need to do something really complex,

192
00:10:15,509 --> 00:10:18,171
we just use a smart animation to react.

193
00:10:18,691 --> 00:10:20,212
And then they return back immediately

194
00:10:20,252 --> 00:10:21,052
to what they were doing.

195
00:10:24,334 --> 00:10:27,675
Then we have the movement and our attention phase.

196
00:10:27,735 --> 00:10:31,477
So to make sure that they will get to the proper distance,

197
00:10:32,237 --> 00:10:34,118
each behavior has comfort zones.

198
00:10:35,112 --> 00:10:35,832
that we define.

199
00:10:37,213 --> 00:10:40,756
So for instance, if I see a steam pipe exploding,

200
00:10:40,816 --> 00:10:42,618
I might stay really far from it.

201
00:10:42,758 --> 00:10:44,900
And if I want to take a picture of something,

202
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,182
I might get a bit closer, but not too close, right?

203
00:10:47,822 --> 00:10:50,705
So the agent will move to the proper distance

204
00:10:52,366 --> 00:10:53,887
in the closest path he can.

205
00:10:55,389 --> 00:10:58,491
We also have the possibility to create angle restriction.

206
00:10:58,992 --> 00:11:00,513
So for some behavior that we want

207
00:11:00,553 --> 00:11:04,096
to make sure that the agent goes in front of the stimulus.

208
00:11:05,185 --> 00:11:09,486
emitter, we can specify it.

209
00:11:09,526 --> 00:11:11,107
So for taking a picture, for instance,

210
00:11:11,127 --> 00:11:14,848
it makes no sense, you will take a picture from the back.

211
00:11:17,568 --> 00:11:20,729
So the core behavior is mainly a loop

212
00:11:21,189 --> 00:11:23,830
of barks and animations.

213
00:11:24,390 --> 00:11:26,270
And there's a follow logic.

214
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,391
So we can specify that don't follow the target

215
00:11:30,411 --> 00:11:32,672
or don't follow it if it goes into the street.

216
00:11:33,985 --> 00:11:35,746
and little criteria like that,

217
00:11:35,826 --> 00:11:38,566
but they will follow the target normally,

218
00:11:38,967 --> 00:11:39,987
like most of the behavior.

219
00:11:40,807 --> 00:11:44,188
And after a certain number of seconds

220
00:11:44,228 --> 00:11:46,528
that we can specify through data,

221
00:11:48,128 --> 00:11:51,269
or if the target is gone or dead or too far,

222
00:11:51,969 --> 00:11:53,530
they will stop doing their behavior

223
00:11:53,550 --> 00:11:54,830
and will go to their exit.

224
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,591
The exit was really important to showcase

225
00:11:57,611 --> 00:11:59,491
that the agent is abandoning the behavior

226
00:11:59,591 --> 00:12:02,252
and transitioning to their previous state.

227
00:12:03,165 --> 00:12:06,406
It's also useful to give an emotional cool down

228
00:12:06,486 --> 00:12:09,327
to the agent, so if they are super angry

229
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:12,128
and they want to go back to washing windows,

230
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:15,370
it makes no sense that they will stay angry.

231
00:12:16,150 --> 00:12:18,711
So it will clash if you don't make them

232
00:12:18,811 --> 00:12:19,811
cool down their emotion.

233
00:12:21,532 --> 00:12:23,053
And then as much as possible,

234
00:12:23,213 --> 00:12:26,094
if they were in an attractor before and got interrupted,

235
00:12:26,914 --> 00:12:29,915
we try to bring them back to the attractor

236
00:12:30,015 --> 00:12:31,056
if it's not too far.

237
00:12:32,192 --> 00:12:36,494
and they can continue walking if they were walking before.

238
00:12:38,574 --> 00:12:41,895
So this is an example of this structure.

239
00:12:42,736 --> 00:12:46,237
Just pay attention to the guy on the right

240
00:12:46,337 --> 00:12:49,698
that is observing the situation and break this down.

241
00:12:49,718 --> 00:12:52,659
Oops.

242
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,461
I don't see my pointer, sorry.

243
00:13:08,977 --> 00:13:11,058
Huh?

244
00:13:11,158 --> 00:13:16,242
This is what you get!

245
00:13:18,763 --> 00:13:20,264
Are you watching, honey?

246
00:13:20,404 --> 00:13:20,825
What?

247
00:13:21,105 --> 00:13:23,667
Okay, what's going on?

248
00:13:23,787 --> 00:13:29,050
So I consider it's a bit

249
00:13:38,397 --> 00:13:41,680
so it's not too long, but you can see the point.

250
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,642
All right, what we learned from this.

251
00:13:48,184 --> 00:13:52,427
So I have seven main key learning I want to share with you.

252
00:13:53,768 --> 00:13:55,429
We'll go through them one by one.

253
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:01,473
So the first thing we saw really early

254
00:14:01,513 --> 00:14:04,555
was that it was really hard to read all the behaviors

255
00:14:04,655 --> 00:14:06,517
and what the agents were doing.

256
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,820
So coherence seems to be a big problem.

257
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:13,021
So we decided to redefine our definition

258
00:14:13,061 --> 00:14:14,061
of emergent behavior.

259
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:18,143
So emergent behavior is actually a behavior which happened

260
00:14:18,183 --> 00:14:21,304
that was not predicted, but is predictable.

261
00:14:22,004 --> 00:14:23,365
So let that sink in.

262
00:14:26,046 --> 00:14:29,707
It means that even if it's something unexpected that happens

263
00:14:30,335 --> 00:14:31,897
it still needs to be plausible,

264
00:14:31,977 --> 00:14:35,239
it still needs to be something you would understand

265
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,000
in the context where it comes from.

266
00:14:37,661 --> 00:14:39,662
So it's really important to keep that in mind.

267
00:14:41,203 --> 00:14:43,185
And since behaviors are something that,

268
00:14:43,545 --> 00:14:45,026
the behavior and the interpretation

269
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:46,887
is something that is really subjective,

270
00:14:48,068 --> 00:14:51,571
we decided to go through an extensive review process

271
00:14:51,611 --> 00:14:55,213
to make sure it worked well

272
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:56,835
and it was readable for everyone.

273
00:14:58,615 --> 00:15:01,895
So one other technique we use is what we call iPad sessions.

274
00:15:03,056 --> 00:15:05,916
We will film each other doing improvisation

275
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:11,217
over the behavior we tried to create.

276
00:15:11,237 --> 00:15:16,819
And with this, we will take the best take

277
00:15:17,059 --> 00:15:20,299
and we'll break it down by the code system,

278
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:21,440
the animation, the barks,

279
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:25,080
and it will create really, really cheap prototypes

280
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:26,521
for every of our behavior,

281
00:15:26,581 --> 00:15:27,501
and we could test them.

282
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:29,721
right away and know that it works.

283
00:15:29,821 --> 00:15:32,642
So I'll give you a short example here.

284
00:15:33,482 --> 00:15:36,823
We tried in this video to create a reaction

285
00:15:36,883 --> 00:15:38,383
to when someone is knocked down.

286
00:15:54,847 --> 00:15:56,368
So it's accelerated, of course,

287
00:15:57,025 --> 00:15:59,806
It gives you an idea of, it's really cheap, right?

288
00:15:59,886 --> 00:16:01,566
And we are in no vectors.

289
00:16:02,066 --> 00:16:05,987
But it allows us to really be on the same page,

290
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:09,287
like the programmers, the designers, the voice designers,

291
00:16:09,868 --> 00:16:13,608
and the animators, and just say, okay, that's our target,

292
00:16:13,928 --> 00:16:17,709
and that's what our goal is to create.

293
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:22,170
Another tool, actually, we use to be sure

294
00:16:22,210 --> 00:16:24,190
we review the process all along the way

295
00:16:24,290 --> 00:16:25,830
is a tool we call Flare.

296
00:16:27,326 --> 00:16:32,807
It's a tool we developed at Ubisoft that allows us to share videos with other developers.

297
00:16:33,328 --> 00:16:36,248
And it's pretty much a YouTube for developers.

298
00:16:36,468 --> 00:16:39,369
So you put a video of whatever you worked on,

299
00:16:39,869 --> 00:16:43,010
and you send it to your peers and they can comment,

300
00:16:43,690 --> 00:16:46,191
and it allows us to iterate really quickly.

301
00:16:49,071 --> 00:16:54,593
So another issue we saw, it was really hard to have control on the outcomes.

302
00:16:55,353 --> 00:16:55,813
So I will...

303
00:16:56,793 --> 00:16:58,994
come from reviews and directors will be like,

304
00:16:59,154 --> 00:17:02,195
I want more violence, I want more people cheering,

305
00:17:02,215 --> 00:17:03,575
I want more this and that.

306
00:17:03,995 --> 00:17:05,455
And it was really hard to control.

307
00:17:05,475 --> 00:17:10,657
And the reason for this is that we use random distribution.

308
00:17:12,957 --> 00:17:15,138
It didn't work, it didn't give us the result

309
00:17:15,178 --> 00:17:16,178
we were looking for.

310
00:17:16,758 --> 00:17:19,739
So we decided to go to a pseudo-random,

311
00:17:20,279 --> 00:17:23,360
then go with a more homogeneous distribution

312
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,940
that allows us to have really the...

313
00:17:27,165 --> 00:17:30,387
the percentage we wanted for each behavior choice.

314
00:17:31,448 --> 00:17:32,489
So it helped us a lot.

315
00:17:35,090 --> 00:17:37,152
Another thing we saw rapidly was that

316
00:17:37,912 --> 00:17:39,453
all our NPC was bipolars.

317
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:42,655
They will switch from one emotion to another

318
00:17:43,016 --> 00:17:44,376
without any logic under it.

319
00:17:45,377 --> 00:17:46,838
So we created the mood system.

320
00:17:48,939 --> 00:17:51,261
The mood system is just a way to categorize

321
00:17:51,341 --> 00:17:53,102
every behavior by mood.

322
00:17:53,342 --> 00:17:54,263
So we have four of them.

323
00:17:55,074 --> 00:18:01,479
The relaxed mood is the default one and the others are more extreme.

324
00:18:02,800 --> 00:18:08,043
That allows us to really create a logic of transition between behavior.

325
00:18:08,464 --> 00:18:14,007
So normally someone that is super angry won't go to cheer immediately, it doesn't make sense.

326
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:18,210
So it will cool down to a relaxed state before being allowed to cheer.

327
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,235
It became a criteria in our decision system

328
00:18:23,335 --> 00:18:25,696
and tells us to add a lot more logic

329
00:18:27,657 --> 00:18:29,398
between behavior transition.

330
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:31,820
And while we were at it,

331
00:18:31,880 --> 00:18:34,441
why not showcase it to the player?

332
00:18:34,561 --> 00:18:38,503
So we have this little face on the profiler card

333
00:18:39,024 --> 00:18:44,967
that gives some feedback on what is on the NPC's mind,

334
00:18:45,047 --> 00:18:46,648
what is his mood state.

335
00:18:47,652 --> 00:18:51,494
So, and players like, they buy it really fast.

336
00:18:51,654 --> 00:18:54,235
They are like, oh, I made this guy angry, I'm happy

337
00:18:54,275 --> 00:18:57,377
because, anyways, he's an asshole or whatever.

338
00:19:00,419 --> 00:19:02,540
One of the things we wanted to do with our NPCs

339
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:04,821
is to give him a lot of flavor.

340
00:19:04,881 --> 00:19:06,282
We didn't want them to look,

341
00:19:07,162 --> 00:19:09,184
to react all the same to the same events.

342
00:19:09,864 --> 00:19:11,585
So we created personalities.

343
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:16,400
What personalities are is really just a tag we put on them

344
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,501
when they spawn, and we use that as a criteria

345
00:19:20,081 --> 00:19:22,841
as the rest to decide what you will do.

346
00:19:22,941 --> 00:19:24,302
So if you're a violent person,

347
00:19:24,322 --> 00:19:25,722
you might react in one way.

348
00:19:26,282 --> 00:19:29,143
If you're an optimistic person, you might react another way.

349
00:19:30,443 --> 00:19:34,184
So as an example of this, I have a debug in this video open

350
00:19:34,604 --> 00:19:36,965
that showcase the personality through a colored disk

351
00:19:37,025 --> 00:19:38,665
over the NPCs ahead.

352
00:19:39,455 --> 00:19:42,998
So people in this video that have a green circle

353
00:19:43,178 --> 00:19:44,079
are optimistic.

354
00:19:44,639 --> 00:19:48,923
And people with the purple circle, they are pessimistic.

355
00:19:48,983 --> 00:19:53,887
So you'll see how they react differently to my attempt

356
00:19:53,927 --> 00:19:54,628
to impress them.

357
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:00,653
You're telling me.

358
00:20:00,673 --> 00:20:03,635
Dude, look at.

359
00:20:05,474 --> 00:20:07,054
Aw, poor little sad doll.

360
00:20:07,074 --> 00:20:09,015
Hates it when no one's paying attention.

361
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:09,495
Ha ha ha ha!

362
00:20:09,515 --> 00:20:11,696
God, this city is full of twigs.

363
00:20:12,536 --> 00:20:13,576
Ha ha ha ha!

364
00:20:13,676 --> 00:20:14,517
Oh my god.

365
00:20:15,177 --> 00:20:15,477
Oh.

366
00:20:15,717 --> 00:20:15,877
Oh.

367
00:20:16,077 --> 00:20:19,198
Oh, man.

368
00:20:20,959 --> 00:20:23,080
Oh, no, don't tell me.

369
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:32,243
All right, so you could see that the green people were really happy.

370
00:20:33,137 --> 00:20:35,998
and found my dance funny and the others were like,

371
00:20:36,058 --> 00:20:36,738
you're stupid.

372
00:20:40,579 --> 00:20:42,719
And what's really good with this kind of system

373
00:20:43,499 --> 00:20:47,600
is that we could give all of our visual stereotype

374
00:20:47,640 --> 00:20:50,041
different personality recipes.

375
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:54,242
So for instance, if I am a rich person from Marin County,

376
00:20:54,882 --> 00:20:57,062
maybe I'll be more pessimistic and neutral.

377
00:20:57,122 --> 00:20:58,363
Maybe I'm more blase, right?

378
00:20:59,423 --> 00:21:01,703
Same thing if I'm a sport fan,

379
00:21:01,763 --> 00:21:02,523
maybe I will be.

380
00:21:03,687 --> 00:21:06,849
really optimistic, but also a little bit more violent

381
00:21:06,909 --> 00:21:09,550
because I might be drunk and stuff like that.

382
00:21:10,650 --> 00:21:13,172
So it allowed us to give a really different flavor

383
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:13,912
per district.

384
00:21:14,332 --> 00:21:16,413
We wanted to keep this pretty organic,

385
00:21:16,673 --> 00:21:19,174
so everyone can have every personality,

386
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,236
but with the recipes, it gives a little flavor

387
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,216
to every district.

388
00:21:28,318 --> 00:21:28,978
All right, so.

389
00:21:30,188 --> 00:21:31,969
With our non-player-centric approach,

390
00:21:32,029 --> 00:21:35,051
we tried first to have the NPC react exactly the same

391
00:21:36,232 --> 00:21:40,514
to the player as they were doing to other NPCs.

392
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,635
And it didn't work.

393
00:21:43,355 --> 00:21:45,636
They were either too reactive or not enough reactive

394
00:21:45,656 --> 00:21:46,097
to the player.

395
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:47,557
And the reason for this is, of course,

396
00:21:48,138 --> 00:21:50,779
the player is not acting like an NPC at all.

397
00:21:51,139 --> 00:21:54,241
It will try to mess around with your AI, will try to push them.

398
00:21:55,001 --> 00:21:57,663
So it still has to be player-proof.

399
00:21:58,283 --> 00:21:59,323
So beware of the dogma.

400
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:06,154
The way we decided to push the non-player-centric approach

401
00:22:06,734 --> 00:22:08,916
is to create provocative agents.

402
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:13,939
So we have some of the AI that sends them

403
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:17,562
to their activities, and that creates life in the city

404
00:22:17,602 --> 00:22:19,103
without any input from the player.

405
00:22:19,984 --> 00:22:25,428
So as an example, you can see the guy playing the guitar

406
00:22:25,468 --> 00:22:29,031
will send stims around, and we have others in the city.

407
00:22:46,709 --> 00:22:51,772
And while we are there, why not give the player the possibility to interact with the NPC the

408
00:22:51,812 --> 00:22:54,214
same way they are interacting with each other.

409
00:22:54,314 --> 00:22:55,615
So we created emotes.

410
00:22:57,383 --> 00:22:58,244
with that in mind.

411
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:00,404
We wanted the player to be able to interact

412
00:23:00,424 --> 00:23:02,185
with other players in multiplayer, of course,

413
00:23:02,545 --> 00:23:03,925
but also with NPCs.

414
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:07,466
So they will react using their normal behavior

415
00:23:08,326 --> 00:23:10,346
that they will use on each other,

416
00:23:10,426 --> 00:23:12,167
but they will react to the player instead

417
00:23:12,307 --> 00:23:13,007
with those emotes.

418
00:23:15,788 --> 00:23:18,548
All right, and like any systemic mechanics,

419
00:23:19,249 --> 00:23:20,489
it can degenerate quickly.

420
00:23:23,090 --> 00:23:27,411
This is really important to have self-stabilizing mechanics.

421
00:23:27,851 --> 00:23:29,871
So we have the emotional cool down, as you saw,

422
00:23:29,911 --> 00:23:34,032
and we made sure that every NPC would be fed up

423
00:23:34,272 --> 00:23:36,592
with the situation quite fast,

424
00:23:36,673 --> 00:23:39,073
because the player attention span is not that long.

425
00:23:40,053 --> 00:23:44,054
So whether the situation will be solved by someone leaving

426
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:45,734
and saying, all right, I'm out of there.

427
00:23:48,142 --> 00:23:51,724
someone being KO in a violent situation, for instance,

428
00:23:51,784 --> 00:23:53,826
or there will always be a soul,

429
00:23:55,287 --> 00:23:59,610
the situation will always resolve on itself quite quickly.

430
00:24:03,893 --> 00:24:06,795
So we were really, really proud about our civilian system.

431
00:24:06,815 --> 00:24:10,038
We were like, yeah, it's the most cool system around

432
00:24:10,158 --> 00:24:12,940
and we have such smart civilians and everything.

433
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:15,502
And we noticed our mission designer decided

434
00:24:15,582 --> 00:24:17,503
not to use them in their layout at all.

435
00:24:18,814 --> 00:24:21,316
So we sat down with them and we're like,

436
00:24:22,296 --> 00:24:24,297
okay, we need civilians in our layouts.

437
00:24:24,418 --> 00:24:26,599
Like some of them are, I don't know if you played the game,

438
00:24:26,639 --> 00:24:28,680
but some of them are like Noodle's office,

439
00:24:28,820 --> 00:24:31,322
or which is our version of Google.

440
00:24:32,222 --> 00:24:34,524
And there should be civilians around,

441
00:24:34,664 --> 00:24:36,525
otherwise it will look empty and weird.

442
00:24:37,205 --> 00:24:39,006
So we sat down with the mission designer,

443
00:24:39,026 --> 00:24:43,089
like what do you need for making civilians,

444
00:24:43,889 --> 00:24:45,290
putting civilians in your layouts?

445
00:24:46,293 --> 00:24:48,675
So with their feedback, we created what we call

446
00:24:48,775 --> 00:24:49,896
affiliated civilians.

447
00:24:50,436 --> 00:24:52,678
So they are civilians that are really visually,

448
00:24:55,521 --> 00:24:57,262
they look like they are part of the layout.

449
00:24:57,582 --> 00:24:59,624
So for instance, if you're on a construction site,

450
00:24:59,664 --> 00:25:01,345
they will have construction garb.

451
00:25:01,946 --> 00:25:04,508
We showcase this on the profiler card as well.

452
00:25:04,608 --> 00:25:06,430
So you're a worker there.

453
00:25:06,490 --> 00:25:09,512
So it gives some feedback to the player that they belong.

454
00:25:11,654 --> 00:25:13,235
They have player detection

455
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:15,217
on the opposite of other civilians.

456
00:25:15,277 --> 00:25:15,377
So.

457
00:25:15,784 --> 00:25:18,645
they can know if the player is not supposed to be there

458
00:25:18,746 --> 00:25:21,227
and interact with him if they see him.

459
00:25:22,227 --> 00:25:24,308
They have the possibility to warn the player

460
00:25:24,408 --> 00:25:25,669
or either alert the guards,

461
00:25:26,189 --> 00:25:28,530
but not every of them will do it.

462
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:32,052
And the reason for this is we saw that otherwise

463
00:25:32,432 --> 00:25:34,893
the player will antagonize them and try to kill them

464
00:25:35,654 --> 00:25:38,015
as any combat AI, and it wasn't the objective.

465
00:25:38,515 --> 00:25:42,637
So some of them might be angry that the player is there,

466
00:25:42,737 --> 00:25:44,218
but some of them might be just curious.

467
00:25:44,863 --> 00:25:47,625
and ask questions and be like, oh, what are you doing here?

468
00:25:48,286 --> 00:25:50,348
So they are not like all assholes,

469
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:53,311
but anything they will do will create some noise

470
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:55,613
that might attract a guard if they are nearby.

471
00:25:58,015 --> 00:26:00,658
They also have special reactions to combat AI

472
00:26:00,738 --> 00:26:03,200
because that they are affiliated with.

473
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:06,523
Because if, for instance, a guard gets an alert

474
00:26:06,603 --> 00:26:09,666
and take his gun out, we don't want the layout to empty.

475
00:26:11,465 --> 00:26:13,886
they know they are belonging there

476
00:26:14,026 --> 00:26:16,907
and the combat AI are just doing their job.

477
00:26:17,507 --> 00:26:18,928
So they won't be too scared.

478
00:26:18,948 --> 00:26:20,989
They might observe, but they won't leave.

479
00:26:22,469 --> 00:26:24,110
And of course, we add some requirements

480
00:26:24,190 --> 00:26:27,131
for most of the layouts being interiors.

481
00:26:27,651 --> 00:26:29,792
So make sure that they can leave

482
00:26:29,872 --> 00:26:31,933
without being in the way of the player,

483
00:26:32,053 --> 00:26:37,535
the combat AI, or take cover and not block anyone.

484
00:26:40,834 --> 00:26:45,458
All right, I want to share with you some of our team structure

485
00:26:45,538 --> 00:26:48,881
because I don't know if any project has this,

486
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:50,502
but it might be useful.

487
00:26:52,524 --> 00:26:54,986
So we had a small, dedicated team

488
00:26:56,167 --> 00:27:00,830
that had one game designer, me, two to three programmers,

489
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:03,052
depending on the phase of production.

490
00:27:03,473 --> 00:27:07,436
We had one voice designer, one writer, about four.

491
00:27:08,127 --> 00:27:11,930
animators and tech animators and two dev testers

492
00:27:12,390 --> 00:27:14,512
that were really dedicated to create this.

493
00:27:15,613 --> 00:27:20,076
As I said earlier, we really valued iteration

494
00:27:20,416 --> 00:27:21,537
and weekly reviews.

495
00:27:21,757 --> 00:27:24,439
Everyone will play the game and try to mess with the civilians

496
00:27:24,519 --> 00:27:27,101
and review the behaviors that were ongoing.

497
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:31,664
So we made sure that it was right at all time.

498
00:27:32,524 --> 00:27:34,626
And our dev tester were really trained

499
00:27:35,606 --> 00:27:36,347
into using.

500
00:27:37,230 --> 00:27:39,512
this system and to understanding this system

501
00:27:40,452 --> 00:27:42,794
so they could give us great feedback.

502
00:27:42,974 --> 00:27:46,396
And it's all that we, I'll go on this,

503
00:27:46,476 --> 00:27:47,937
but I'll talk about the debugging tool.

504
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:51,039
It's helped that we had really good debugging tools

505
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:54,161
to give them some leverage.

506
00:27:56,863 --> 00:27:58,764
For production, the tool we use

507
00:27:58,904 --> 00:28:02,106
is actually a spreadsheet in Excel,

508
00:28:02,807 --> 00:28:02,987
but,

509
00:28:04,010 --> 00:28:08,772
we create a tool out of it, it's not just a pure Excel sheet.

510
00:28:09,653 --> 00:28:14,475
And we have about 700 logic rules,

511
00:28:16,336 --> 00:28:19,098
so it's just the gameplay of what behavior we will choose.

512
00:28:20,378 --> 00:28:23,220
We also manage the reaction, animation and barks

513
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:26,702
in the reaction tools so the animators and audio designer

514
00:28:26,762 --> 00:28:29,703
can have context on the events the agent received

515
00:28:30,243 --> 00:28:32,505
and plug your reaction accordingly.

516
00:28:33,877 --> 00:28:37,099
But if you count the combination power,

517
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,702
we have billions of rows actually.

518
00:28:41,603 --> 00:28:45,546
So that's how the tool look.

519
00:28:51,890 --> 00:28:55,553
All right, so all the columns in green are criteria.

520
00:28:56,574 --> 00:29:00,537
So incidents or what's my personality, et cetera.

521
00:29:00,964 --> 00:29:03,765
All the columns in blue are outputs,

522
00:29:03,845 --> 00:29:05,386
so any behavior they can go in.

523
00:29:07,767 --> 00:29:11,109
So the way we did it is simply using filter

524
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:13,630
to see what type of incident I'm looking at.

525
00:29:14,230 --> 00:29:18,252
And the reason we did it in Excel

526
00:29:18,312 --> 00:29:20,573
is because there's a lot of built-in functions,

527
00:29:20,613 --> 00:29:21,414
so it was easier.

528
00:29:21,474 --> 00:29:25,556
But it's not necessarily the perfect tool for doing it,

529
00:29:25,596 --> 00:29:27,697
the perfect platform.

530
00:29:28,784 --> 00:29:32,025
So you could add a rule and just specify any criteria

531
00:29:32,065 --> 00:29:33,246
really easily through lists.

532
00:29:35,027 --> 00:29:37,648
So for instance, I have a civilian that is on foot

533
00:29:38,108 --> 00:29:39,209
and is violent.

534
00:29:43,271 --> 00:29:45,872
And is getting ready to float on.

535
00:29:51,015 --> 00:29:54,996
So we also, with this list, we could use the checkbox

536
00:29:55,456 --> 00:29:57,197
to create our statements.

537
00:29:57,777 --> 00:30:01,138
So it allowed us to combine a lot of rules into one rule

538
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,618
and make it more manageable.

539
00:30:03,359 --> 00:30:07,980
So for instance, if I am violent or pessimistic,

540
00:30:08,860 --> 00:30:10,540
I might decide to use this output.

541
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:16,822
So it helps us to create a manageable amount of rules.

542
00:30:18,202 --> 00:30:19,323
So if I don't have the...

543
00:30:20,462 --> 00:30:22,744
the right output, like if I don't put 100%,

544
00:30:22,925 --> 00:30:25,107
the tool will tell me.

545
00:30:26,288 --> 00:30:31,673
So let's say I put 50% keep state, 50% cheer,

546
00:30:33,514 --> 00:30:37,058
and now it's a valid output.

547
00:30:40,341 --> 00:30:43,023
And I would just zoom out so you can see a bit,

548
00:30:43,043 --> 00:30:45,626
how many rows there is.

549
00:30:46,026 --> 00:30:46,387
But it's.

550
00:30:46,689 --> 00:30:48,350
It looks intimidating, it's not so bad

551
00:30:48,430 --> 00:30:52,131
because we use filters, so it's manageable.

552
00:30:54,251 --> 00:30:57,572
All right, so we needed a really strong debugging tool

553
00:30:57,632 --> 00:30:59,573
to make sure we could understand whatever

554
00:30:59,633 --> 00:31:01,033
what's going on with our AI.

555
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:04,894
We have a tool that was created specifically

556
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:07,195
for Watch Dogs 2 that's called Dissect.

557
00:31:08,346 --> 00:31:10,708
It allows us to record everything happening.

558
00:31:11,228 --> 00:31:14,510
So let's see all the animations, all the barks,

559
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:17,833
all the rules that are chosen.

560
00:31:20,114 --> 00:31:22,256
And after that, you can stop and rewind.

561
00:31:24,577 --> 00:31:27,119
And that's really useful because you can see

562
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:29,800
exactly at every moment what happened.

563
00:31:30,361 --> 00:31:34,003
And our dev testers could use this to export files

564
00:31:34,063 --> 00:31:34,844
and send it to us.

565
00:31:35,204 --> 00:31:36,085
Hey, I've seen this bug.

566
00:31:37,090 --> 00:31:40,533
here what happens and it was really easy to debug this way.

567
00:31:41,674 --> 00:31:43,855
And you have like the rule ID and everything

568
00:31:43,975 --> 00:31:47,918
so you can see exactly the path the AI took

569
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:49,259
to take his decision.

570
00:31:52,582 --> 00:31:55,224
All right, so what's next, what we want to,

571
00:31:56,004 --> 00:31:57,165
where we want to go from there.

572
00:31:59,687 --> 00:32:02,049
So we had trouble with

573
00:32:02,714 --> 00:32:04,674
behavior that requires a dialogue.

574
00:32:05,515 --> 00:32:08,075
And the reason for this is because it's really hard

575
00:32:08,095 --> 00:32:10,436
to synchronize dialogue in an emergent way.

576
00:32:11,476 --> 00:32:15,237
So for any violent behavior, it was really easy

577
00:32:15,357 --> 00:32:18,237
because people don't tend to listen to each other

578
00:32:18,297 --> 00:32:20,598
when they are arguing, so it doesn't matter

579
00:32:20,658 --> 00:32:21,978
if they speak over each other.

580
00:32:22,938 --> 00:32:26,139
But anything that is more like flirting, for instance,

581
00:32:27,379 --> 00:32:30,219
you need to understand what the person is saying to you

582
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:31,120
and understand.

583
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:32,687
answer accordingly.

584
00:32:33,388 --> 00:32:35,609
And that was something we could do,

585
00:32:35,669 --> 00:32:38,031
but it was too costly with the system we had.

586
00:32:38,471 --> 00:32:40,793
So it's something we really want to develop in the future

587
00:32:42,254 --> 00:32:45,636
and build on it.

588
00:32:46,136 --> 00:32:48,698
We also had some issues with rule competition.

589
00:32:48,778 --> 00:32:52,401
So we had so many criteria, at some point it could happen

590
00:32:52,481 --> 00:32:54,422
that two rules were both true

591
00:32:54,502 --> 00:32:56,023
and had the same number of criteria.

592
00:32:56,644 --> 00:32:56,844
So...

593
00:32:58,779 --> 00:33:01,960
And since it's all contextual, it's really like,

594
00:33:02,220 --> 00:33:06,442
I need to go by N, and I get an assert whenever it happens,

595
00:33:06,502 --> 00:33:08,783
and I need to go by N and check the rules and say,

596
00:33:08,863 --> 00:33:12,104
okay, in this situation, I want to pick this one

597
00:33:12,144 --> 00:33:12,725
and not this one.

598
00:33:13,485 --> 00:33:16,546
That was not ideal, and we want to improve on this

599
00:33:16,626 --> 00:33:18,367
to make sure it's more automated next time.

600
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:26,530
And also, we applied this emergent system on our combat AI,

601
00:33:26,690 --> 00:33:26,850
but.

602
00:33:28,253 --> 00:33:29,794
It's only when they are not alert,

603
00:33:29,854 --> 00:33:32,835
so as soon as they enter a gameplay mindset,

604
00:33:33,075 --> 00:33:34,256
they just ignore everything,

605
00:33:34,276 --> 00:33:37,377
then they get really straightforward.

606
00:33:37,397 --> 00:33:43,900
Annoying because they don't look smart

607
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,000
when they are in gameplay.

608
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:47,741
They will just ignore everything around them

609
00:33:47,801 --> 00:33:49,882
and be like super straight-minded.

610
00:33:51,603 --> 00:33:54,984
It's okay, but we want to make sure next time

611
00:33:55,004 --> 00:33:57,045
we add more emergence to them.

612
00:33:58,345 --> 00:34:01,685
So let's talk a bit about the results.

613
00:34:03,826 --> 00:34:07,387
We noticed that with Watch Dogs 2 compared to Watch Dogs 1,

614
00:34:08,067 --> 00:34:12,748
a player will spend about 30% more time in open world

615
00:34:12,808 --> 00:34:15,468
doing nothing of the track activities.

616
00:34:16,329 --> 00:34:21,010
So we think that the reaction system

617
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:23,190
helped a lot to inspire the player

618
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:25,951
to mess around with civilians and just have fun,

619
00:34:27,333 --> 00:34:28,734
running around San Francisco.

620
00:34:29,635 --> 00:34:32,417
We had a lot of creative videos from YouTube and Twitch,

621
00:34:32,857 --> 00:34:35,299
which were really interesting.

622
00:34:35,439 --> 00:34:37,320
And most of the time it looks like bugs,

623
00:34:37,360 --> 00:34:39,422
but we are like, oh, but they have fun with this.

624
00:34:39,462 --> 00:34:40,783
So that's fine.

625
00:34:41,944 --> 00:34:43,805
And we got really positive reviews

626
00:34:44,646 --> 00:34:46,907
that are really specific on this system.

627
00:34:46,967 --> 00:34:49,229
So we think it's really positive.

628
00:34:52,091 --> 00:34:52,772
So thank you.

629
00:34:54,013 --> 00:34:55,073
I hope you enjoy it.

630
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:56,715
And I'm here to answer questions.

631
00:35:06,160 --> 00:35:07,500
Yeah, I went too fast.

632
00:35:13,001 --> 00:35:15,042
Folks, we have plenty of time for questions.

633
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:17,422
There are microphones in the aisles.

634
00:35:17,462 --> 00:35:20,683
This is going to be a good rule of thumb for not only the two days of the AI Summit, but

635
00:35:20,803 --> 00:35:21,183
all week.

636
00:35:21,944 --> 00:35:26,425
If you have questions for Roxanne, please step up to the microphone so that it ends

637
00:35:26,485 --> 00:35:27,465
up sticking to the tape.

638
00:35:27,505 --> 00:35:28,305
So go ahead.

639
00:35:28,345 --> 00:35:28,445
Hello.

640
00:35:29,825 --> 00:35:30,686
I know.

641
00:35:30,706 --> 00:35:31,606
Almost in time.

642
00:35:31,626 --> 00:35:31,786
I know.

643
00:35:31,806 --> 00:35:32,206
Almost in time.

644
00:35:33,083 --> 00:35:34,344
Thanks for opening the conference.

645
00:35:34,924 --> 00:35:36,745
I wanted to ask about your reaction tools.

646
00:35:36,805 --> 00:35:39,146
You talked about how you did that in Excel,

647
00:35:39,266 --> 00:35:40,467
and you kind of had to gloss over,

648
00:35:40,967 --> 00:35:42,848
well, it's pretty good because it does all the stuff,

649
00:35:42,928 --> 00:35:44,829
but there's always some things you don't like about it.

650
00:35:45,449 --> 00:35:47,390
Could you elaborate a little bit on what worked

651
00:35:47,470 --> 00:35:49,151
and didn't work using Excel for it,

652
00:35:49,171 --> 00:35:50,632
and what's your ideal tool?

653
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:52,913
Maybe, you know, you probably need an hour for that,

654
00:35:53,013 --> 00:35:55,214
but what the ideal tool for authoring all this would be?

655
00:35:55,574 --> 00:35:56,655
Yeah, what's your name?

656
00:35:57,075 --> 00:35:57,415
Matthias.

657
00:35:57,875 --> 00:35:59,056
Okay.

658
00:35:59,816 --> 00:36:00,236
Actually,

659
00:36:01,495 --> 00:36:03,796
I think the worst about this tool is that

660
00:36:04,736 --> 00:36:07,258
I needed three screens to have everything.

661
00:36:07,278 --> 00:36:11,219
The visibility is really hard because it's a spreadsheet.

662
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:16,282
I mean, we can filter, but still the information

663
00:36:16,362 --> 00:36:17,562
is more horizontal.

664
00:36:18,283 --> 00:36:20,524
That was one of the main problems with it.

665
00:36:22,184 --> 00:36:25,026
But it allowed us to iterate really quickly.

666
00:36:25,186 --> 00:36:28,467
So if I needed something new to be added to the tool, it's.

667
00:36:28,812 --> 00:36:31,693
like I has the tool programmer and boom it was there.

668
00:36:32,874 --> 00:36:34,815
So it depends.

669
00:36:35,615 --> 00:36:36,796
It was a quick solution.

670
00:36:36,816 --> 00:36:42,178
Ideally we would have our own tool with nice interface.

671
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:47,641
But yeah, I guess the biggest issue was the interface.

672
00:36:49,422 --> 00:36:50,623
I know there's a bunch of people asking,

673
00:36:50,983 --> 00:36:51,963
just one quick follow-up.

674
00:36:52,143 --> 00:36:53,424
What did it actually export to?

675
00:36:53,484 --> 00:36:55,825
What was the actual path into the game

676
00:36:55,865 --> 00:36:57,006
and how quick was the situation?

677
00:36:58,139 --> 00:36:58,959
Sorry, I didn't hear.

678
00:36:59,039 --> 00:37:02,781
What was the actual iteration when you're done in Excel?

679
00:37:02,861 --> 00:37:03,821
What does it export to?

680
00:37:03,961 --> 00:37:05,602
How does it get imported into the game?

681
00:37:05,662 --> 00:37:06,462
Is there hot linking?

682
00:37:06,622 --> 00:37:06,962
Oh, yeah.

683
00:37:07,002 --> 00:37:10,163
The links are really easy, actually.

684
00:37:10,183 --> 00:37:12,984
The sheet is turned into an XML, and then it's

685
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:13,885
read by the engine.

686
00:37:14,305 --> 00:37:18,126
So I just need to save, and boom, it's already, even if

687
00:37:18,166 --> 00:37:18,826
the game is running.

688
00:37:18,846 --> 00:37:22,468
Yeah.

689
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:28,300
Hi, I'm Isaac.

690
00:37:28,620 --> 00:37:30,000
I was wondering if you had a system

691
00:37:30,620 --> 00:37:33,321
to allow a character to break one behavior

692
00:37:33,401 --> 00:37:34,901
and jump into another one based on

693
00:37:35,342 --> 00:37:36,542
the priority of the behavior.

694
00:37:36,582 --> 00:37:38,002
So if you have a car coming at you

695
00:37:38,522 --> 00:37:40,883
and you can see it, you probably won't keep arguing

696
00:37:40,923 --> 00:37:42,223
with someone, you'll jump out of the way.

697
00:37:42,643 --> 00:37:43,804
So a priority system.

698
00:37:44,624 --> 00:37:45,044
What's your name?

699
00:37:45,404 --> 00:37:45,624
Isaac.

700
00:37:46,084 --> 00:37:47,144
Okay.

701
00:37:48,305 --> 00:37:51,525
Actually, no, because our criteria allowed us

702
00:37:51,585 --> 00:37:55,146
to make enough context to be able to filter out

703
00:37:55,186 --> 00:37:55,967
what we don't want.

704
00:37:56,027 --> 00:37:56,147
So.

705
00:37:56,610 --> 00:38:00,511
Because I'm using, in each rule I'm using

706
00:38:00,551 --> 00:38:01,532
in what state I am.

707
00:38:02,092 --> 00:38:05,073
So if I'm, I don't know, I'm running away,

708
00:38:05,093 --> 00:38:08,013
I might ignore a lot of things.

709
00:38:08,394 --> 00:38:10,474
But if I'm just walking around,

710
00:38:10,534 --> 00:38:12,975
I might be aware of more things.

711
00:38:13,435 --> 00:38:18,336
So we didn't really need to create a full priority system

712
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,417
because we want to keep it contextual.

713
00:38:21,437 --> 00:38:23,958
No problem.

714
00:38:28,376 --> 00:38:35,821
Hi, I'm Chris. I worked on the dialogue management tools for Hitman and I'm

715
00:38:35,881 --> 00:38:44,567
curious how you connect all the dialogue required for the AI to your setup in

716
00:38:44,607 --> 00:38:50,771
Excel. Do you manage that in Excel and how did it work out? Because clearly for

717
00:38:50,811 --> 00:38:55,153
a game of that scale you need lots and lots of barks and dialogues and reactions.

718
00:38:55,794 --> 00:38:56,434
Yes, so...

719
00:38:57,762 --> 00:38:59,963
For the reaction part of the behavior,

720
00:39:00,083 --> 00:39:01,624
it's all in the Excel tool.

721
00:39:02,704 --> 00:39:05,365
So it allows the voice designer to decide

722
00:39:05,425 --> 00:39:07,926
like with any criteria they need

723
00:39:09,266 --> 00:39:12,288
to make really specific bark or really generic bark

724
00:39:12,348 --> 00:39:13,708
depending on the situation.

725
00:39:14,788 --> 00:39:17,629
For everything that is behavior inside the behavior loop,

726
00:39:18,450 --> 00:39:19,890
it's just plug in the behavior.

727
00:39:19,950 --> 00:39:21,371
It's like they have variety,

728
00:39:21,411 --> 00:39:24,772
but it's not as contextual as the reaction itself.

729
00:39:26,040 --> 00:39:28,302
And there's no separate tool for managing this?

730
00:39:28,342 --> 00:39:29,443
This is all in your...

731
00:39:30,104 --> 00:39:34,027
No, it's just plugged in the Excel sheet.

732
00:39:34,067 --> 00:39:37,831
We have a tool that's called Oasis to manage all the bugs.

733
00:39:38,872 --> 00:39:41,274
But yeah, it's just communicate together.

734
00:39:41,294 --> 00:39:42,915
Okay, thank you.

735
00:39:43,175 --> 00:39:43,576
No problem.

736
00:39:46,158 --> 00:39:46,658
Hi, Roxanne.

737
00:39:46,839 --> 00:39:47,079
Hi.

738
00:39:48,140 --> 00:39:50,782
I really like the visuals you showed off in this

739
00:39:50,822 --> 00:39:53,004
with both basically the colors, but also just the...

740
00:39:53,922 --> 00:39:55,183
the timestamp of what's going on.

741
00:39:55,223 --> 00:39:57,944
So, a question I had was, a lot of the actions seem like

742
00:39:58,004 --> 00:40:00,986
there are agents responding to the player character,

743
00:40:01,286 --> 00:40:03,547
but then you had a situation where you had two characters

744
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:04,608
doing like the marriage proposal.

745
00:40:05,208 --> 00:40:07,590
So, like dialogue is this kind of joint action

746
00:40:07,610 --> 00:40:09,230
where the NPCs need to coordinate.

747
00:40:09,310 --> 00:40:11,932
Was there other coordination between other NPCs

748
00:40:11,952 --> 00:40:14,213
that you achieved, given that a lot of this looks like

749
00:40:14,413 --> 00:40:15,434
kind of autonomous agents

750
00:40:15,614 --> 00:40:17,275
and cooperation might be challenging?

751
00:40:18,195 --> 00:40:20,516
Yeah, most of the synchronized dialogue in the game.

752
00:40:21,787 --> 00:40:24,187
they are done through this attractor system,

753
00:40:24,267 --> 00:40:26,287
so it's sort of scripted.

754
00:40:26,767 --> 00:40:30,408
So, it's, they just, like,

755
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:32,468
they know they are in a dialogue situation,

756
00:40:32,548 --> 00:40:34,829
so they will spawn one of the dialogues that we prepared.

757
00:40:35,669 --> 00:40:36,509
When they interrupt,

758
00:40:36,749 --> 00:40:38,709
they get interrupted by the reaction system,

759
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:40,010
and they go back.

760
00:40:40,130 --> 00:40:43,550
They might continue the conversation where they left it.

761
00:40:44,410 --> 00:40:47,071
So, but into the reaction system itself,

762
00:40:47,151 --> 00:40:48,931
there's no dialogue coordination.

763
00:40:53,288 --> 00:41:02,852
Hi Roxanne, I was curious to know if you came across behaviors where two AIs spoke with

764
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:08,915
each other in a way and if you saw something interesting in terms of that aspect.

765
00:41:08,975 --> 00:41:15,857
Like for an example, if you had two AIs following you in an alley, did you have like a messaging

766
00:41:15,917 --> 00:41:18,118
system that like one of the AI goes in?

767
00:41:19,087 --> 00:41:23,849
in front of you to fight you and the other is like trying to see if you're trying to run away and then tackle you

768
00:41:24,530 --> 00:41:25,190
or something like that.

769
00:41:26,310 --> 00:41:28,211
So I'm not sure I understood your question.

770
00:41:28,532 --> 00:41:35,635
You mean that if we had some situation where AI had an interesting emergent conversation or?

771
00:41:36,035 --> 00:41:41,758
No, what I meant was internally, like let's say there are two people,

772
00:41:42,519 --> 00:41:44,100
imagine that they're following you.

773
00:41:46,133 --> 00:41:49,494
One guy is trying to fight you from front,

774
00:41:49,674 --> 00:41:51,295
but what if you try to run away?

775
00:41:51,815 --> 00:41:53,295
Then there's another guy at the back

776
00:41:53,335 --> 00:41:56,356
who's trying to stop you from running away.

777
00:41:56,436 --> 00:41:58,897
So it's some kind of communication between both the AIs

778
00:41:59,437 --> 00:42:01,197
that, you know.

779
00:42:02,338 --> 00:42:05,979
Yeah, everyone that is targeting someone

780
00:42:06,019 --> 00:42:07,959
will have information about this target.

781
00:42:08,059 --> 00:42:11,100
So if I'm fighting someone and he runs away,

782
00:42:11,140 --> 00:42:13,461
I know the distance and I can make a decision.

783
00:42:14,936 --> 00:42:17,337
toward the distance when I try to follow them.

784
00:42:17,377 --> 00:42:19,938
And if they jump a wall and I see I cannot pathfind,

785
00:42:19,998 --> 00:42:21,478
well, I might abandon.

786
00:42:22,198 --> 00:42:23,239
So that's, yeah.

787
00:42:23,439 --> 00:42:25,400
Do the AIs plan out the logic?

788
00:42:26,420 --> 00:42:29,721
No, there's no communication except

789
00:42:31,522 --> 00:42:33,222
I know information on my target

790
00:42:33,463 --> 00:42:35,563
and I know information about the events around.

791
00:42:36,424 --> 00:42:39,725
So for the combat AI, we do have squad tactics,

792
00:42:39,745 --> 00:42:41,125
we have communication between them,

793
00:42:41,746 --> 00:42:42,566
but it was, it's,

794
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:46,760
what we call advanced mindset that we don't want to have on any civilians

795
00:42:47,020 --> 00:42:48,821
because it's too costly.

796
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:58,985
But we could potentially, with this system actually, it spurts it that we could upgrade the civilians to an advanced mindset

797
00:42:59,145 --> 00:43:01,245
and then you will be able to communicate with others.

798
00:43:01,866 --> 00:43:05,207
But we don't use that really often in the context of the game.

799
00:43:05,787 --> 00:43:06,807
Thank you. No problem.

800
00:43:09,513 --> 00:43:12,576
Hi Roxanne, thanks for this talk, it was quite fascinating to me.

801
00:43:12,676 --> 00:43:14,978
I worked on the crowd systems for Horizon Zero Dawn.

802
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:19,162
I was wondering how you handled the spawning of NPCs for Watch Dogs 2.

803
00:43:19,543 --> 00:43:23,086
So are they very tight to the location where you spawn them,

804
00:43:23,206 --> 00:43:25,108
or do they move between areas of the city?

805
00:43:25,128 --> 00:43:27,871
Like how does that factor into this reaction system?

806
00:43:29,433 --> 00:43:31,895
Yes, so we have an occlusion spawning system.

807
00:43:33,749 --> 00:43:41,292
They are quite tied to the location because we wanted a specific visual stereotype to stay in their own district.

808
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:47,035
We didn't want them to change too much, so that's why we did it this way.

809
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:54,739
But yeah, they spawn in a bubble around the player and we have this LOD thing going on.

810
00:43:56,000 --> 00:44:01,983
I don't, it didn't work specifically on the spawning system, so that's about what I know on it.

811
00:44:02,143 --> 00:44:02,803
Okay, thanks a lot.

812
00:44:03,063 --> 00:44:03,383
No problem.

813
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:06,522
Hi.

814
00:44:06,722 --> 00:44:07,002
Hi.

815
00:44:07,062 --> 00:44:07,883
My name is Bilgam.

816
00:44:07,983 --> 00:44:13,007
My question is about the stimuli and reaction that

817
00:44:13,067 --> 00:44:15,289
happen between, say, person A and person B.

818
00:44:17,471 --> 00:44:20,314
I can understand how person A does something

819
00:44:20,394 --> 00:44:22,836
and it creates a stimuli, and person B sees it and reacts

820
00:44:22,856 --> 00:44:27,841
to it, but sometimes it seems like the cases would

821
00:44:27,901 --> 00:44:31,684
become interesting stimuli out of this combined.

822
00:44:32,280 --> 00:44:35,783
A doing something and B reacting to it becomes a stimuli.

823
00:44:35,803 --> 00:44:41,768
But then how do you control that to still stay a finite number of things?

824
00:44:41,988 --> 00:44:46,032
Yeah, it was a problem for sure at the beginning.

825
00:44:46,592 --> 00:44:52,257
So we created limiters for any really, I would say, loud behaviors.

826
00:44:52,697 --> 00:45:00,984
So, for instance, if you have two people that want to punch the same target,

827
00:45:01,575 --> 00:45:07,657
we have a limiter system saying like this target is already reserved I cannot punch it so I will

828
00:45:07,877 --> 00:45:16,579
decide to fall back to observe instead and we use that for many situations where it was potentially

829
00:45:16,619 --> 00:45:24,661
a problem. Hello Roxanne. Hi. So you mentioned that your NPCs became bipolar at some point

830
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:28,562
I was wondering how did you deal with those oscillation concerns?

831
00:45:29,471 --> 00:45:31,751
I mentioned, sorry, can you repeat, please?

832
00:45:31,791 --> 00:45:33,992
You mentioned that your NPCs became bipolar

833
00:45:34,032 --> 00:45:35,832
because they would switch around too many things.

834
00:45:35,852 --> 00:45:37,352
I was wondering how did you deal

835
00:45:37,372 --> 00:45:41,053
with those kinds of oscillation concerns?

836
00:45:41,293 --> 00:45:44,574
So I mentioned we dealt with AI switching

837
00:45:45,274 --> 00:45:46,834
between emotions, that's it?

838
00:45:47,934 --> 00:45:50,855
Yeah, I mean, those kinds of problems are common

839
00:45:50,915 --> 00:45:53,035
in open world games.

840
00:45:53,235 --> 00:45:55,595
Another question I want to ask, which is related,

841
00:45:56,215 --> 00:45:58,856
is so there's a marriage proposal going on.

842
00:45:59,335 --> 00:46:00,836
and a bomb explodes across the street.

843
00:46:01,236 --> 00:46:02,336
Now you don't want those people,

844
00:46:02,416 --> 00:46:03,897
when they bail out of that behavior,

845
00:46:03,937 --> 00:46:06,037
to go back into the managed proposal.

846
00:46:06,517 --> 00:46:09,298
Yeah, but that's why we use cool down.

847
00:46:09,338 --> 00:46:13,039
So basically, if I want to go back to an action

848
00:46:13,059 --> 00:46:14,399
that is in the relaxed mood,

849
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:17,140
which is most of the action of the game,

850
00:46:18,200 --> 00:46:21,861
like walking or washing a window or having a conversation,

851
00:46:21,881 --> 00:46:24,362
I will always have a cool down.

852
00:46:24,382 --> 00:46:27,183
So if I'm happy, I'll be like, ah.

853
00:46:27,977 --> 00:46:36,439
And then I go back to, so it helped us giving a logical transition for an emotional state

854
00:46:36,479 --> 00:46:37,340
to the relaxed mood.

855
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:40,140
Okay, so that was the mood system would take care of it.

856
00:46:40,340 --> 00:46:41,101
Yeah, exactly.

857
00:46:42,161 --> 00:46:45,062
That's why we introduced it because otherwise it was unreadable.

858
00:46:46,042 --> 00:46:46,342
Thank you.

859
00:46:46,722 --> 00:46:47,063
No problem.

860
00:46:48,963 --> 00:46:49,243
Hi.

861
00:46:49,563 --> 00:46:49,623
Hi.

862
00:46:50,559 --> 00:46:51,799
I don't have a question actually.

863
00:46:51,819 --> 00:46:55,740
I'm Mathieu, technical director on Watch Dogs 2.

864
00:46:55,780 --> 00:46:58,001
So I just want to take a moment to say,

865
00:46:59,161 --> 00:47:01,861
even if I had a wider impact on this system,

866
00:47:01,981 --> 00:47:03,482
it mostly took all my attention,

867
00:47:03,882 --> 00:47:07,543
because of how passion it can be on this subject.

868
00:47:07,603 --> 00:47:10,483
So we'll be together at the booth, at the launch.

869
00:47:11,904 --> 00:47:15,944
So I'll be happy to share the same passion as her.

870
00:47:18,200 --> 00:47:20,421
If you have more questions, we'll be on Wednesday

871
00:47:20,581 --> 00:47:21,982
at the Ubisoft Lounge.

872
00:47:22,423 --> 00:47:26,205
So me and Mathieu can share more about the animation system

873
00:47:26,246 --> 00:47:27,426
if you're interested into that.

874
00:47:28,967 --> 00:47:31,009
And we can answer more questions if you want.

875
00:47:31,429 --> 00:47:35,012
All right, thank you.

876
00:47:38,614 --> 00:47:39,195
Don't go far.

877
00:47:39,775 --> 00:47:40,296
Stay here a sec.

878
00:47:40,316 --> 00:47:46,140
All right, we've got 15 minutes left, or 11 minutes, excuse me.

879
00:47:47,185 --> 00:47:53,567
wrong glasses right now. So I'm going to put Roxanne on the spot a little bit and

880
00:47:53,727 --> 00:47:57,467
but don't answer if it's gonna get you fired or something. I don't want that on

881
00:47:57,507 --> 00:48:06,129
my conscience. In the spirit of kind of a post-mortem-y thing, what went wrong? What

882
00:48:06,169 --> 00:48:12,750
was something that you just said, oh wow, if we had only known or we went down a

883
00:48:12,830 --> 00:48:16,171
rabbit hole too far and by that time it was too late?

884
00:48:16,607 --> 00:48:19,530
What's something that you think, looking back,

885
00:48:20,370 --> 00:48:22,512
it would have been better to approach something

886
00:48:22,532 --> 00:48:25,695
in a different way or that you've neglected to do?

887
00:48:26,836 --> 00:48:32,760
I would say our biggest challenge was the audio pipeline.

888
00:48:33,681 --> 00:48:36,083
It was our biggest blocker because if you use

889
00:48:36,163 --> 00:48:38,365
an audio pipeline that is traditional

890
00:48:38,765 --> 00:48:42,709
for systemic dialogue like this, it's really hard

891
00:48:43,029 --> 00:48:43,289
because

892
00:48:43,794 --> 00:48:45,535
you decide to create it,

893
00:48:45,635 --> 00:48:47,875
and we were into an iterative process, right?

894
00:48:48,196 --> 00:48:50,576
So we decided to create this behavior,

895
00:48:50,676 --> 00:48:52,177
and then the other guys will know,

896
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:54,278
and they have to write the lines,

897
00:48:54,738 --> 00:48:55,758
go through recording,

898
00:48:57,359 --> 00:48:58,239
and bring that,

899
00:48:58,519 --> 00:49:00,080
and then we see it in the game.

900
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:02,560
And sometime it didn't fit

901
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,801
with the intention of the behavior,

902
00:49:04,881 --> 00:49:06,782
so it was really hard to manage.

903
00:49:06,982 --> 00:49:09,343
And so I guess that the audio pipeline

904
00:49:09,903 --> 00:49:11,363
for this kind of system is something

905
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:13,564
you really want to work on and make sure.

906
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:17,919
that it fits systemic actually.

907
00:49:18,759 --> 00:49:21,020
So we are working on solutions for this,

908
00:49:21,180 --> 00:49:24,501
but I cannot reveal any of our strategies, sorry.

909
00:49:24,521 --> 00:49:27,842
Let's encourage, no that's not, that'll get it.

910
00:49:28,643 --> 00:49:31,183
Was there anything else that you thought was something

911
00:49:31,224 --> 00:49:34,765
that was, go ahead, stay in the center.

912
00:49:35,265 --> 00:49:37,766
Well actually, down the process,

913
00:49:38,306 --> 00:49:41,047
having the personality and the emotion system,

914
00:49:42,108 --> 00:49:44,209
We really did it during production.

915
00:49:44,269 --> 00:49:48,830
It's something I want to make sure we do it in advance

916
00:49:48,910 --> 00:49:51,911
next time and that fits more in the system.

917
00:49:52,951 --> 00:49:56,372
We also have this, I mentioned it earlier,

918
00:49:56,432 --> 00:50:00,153
but the combat AI is not emergent and they look dumb.

919
00:50:00,393 --> 00:50:03,274
When our civilians are trying to interact with combat AI,

920
00:50:03,314 --> 00:50:04,854
for instance, they look more intelligent

921
00:50:04,894 --> 00:50:07,195
because they react to everything,

922
00:50:07,355 --> 00:50:09,956
but our combat AI don't, so they are just.

923
00:50:10,504 --> 00:50:16,128
continuing, continuously trying to warn them

924
00:50:16,248 --> 00:50:18,350
to get out of the layout or stuff like that,

925
00:50:18,430 --> 00:50:20,131
and they are like, but I don't want to,

926
00:50:20,271 --> 00:50:22,133
and they continue their own stuff.

927
00:50:22,153 --> 00:50:23,814
So we have some conflicts like that

928
00:50:23,894 --> 00:50:27,377
because the combat AI is really straightforward.

929
00:50:27,397 --> 00:50:29,378
Okay, well, that's cool.

930
00:50:29,398 --> 00:50:32,721
Give me one, what is your favorite thing

931
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:36,443
that you ever saw happen in the game that nobody planned?

932
00:50:37,248 --> 00:50:40,309
that just emerged from the emergent AI.

933
00:50:40,630 --> 00:50:44,932
Give us one little anecdote of this made it for me

934
00:50:44,992 --> 00:50:47,914
completely, this made everything worthwhile.

935
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:53,397
There's a lot, so it's such a question.

936
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,658
Because we saw a lot of really cool videos

937
00:50:55,698 --> 00:50:58,099
that YouTubers and people on Twitch did

938
00:50:58,179 --> 00:51:01,361
and it was like wow, that was not supposed to happen,

939
00:51:01,461 --> 00:51:02,381
but it's awesome.

940
00:51:03,702 --> 00:51:04,242
One of them is,

941
00:51:07,160 --> 00:51:09,982
At some point, there was a player that tried to,

942
00:51:10,002 --> 00:51:12,704
he had a fight with a lady,

943
00:51:13,385 --> 00:51:17,508
and he punched her down and she dropped on the ground.

944
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:21,091
Oh, sure, that's hilarious.

945
00:51:21,611 --> 00:51:23,633
No, no, that's not the hilarious part.

946
00:51:23,693 --> 00:51:26,055
Oh, there's more, okay.

947
00:51:26,595 --> 00:51:31,059
So cops arrive, and they go to the lady

948
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:33,181
and they wake her up, which is like,

949
00:51:33,281 --> 00:51:34,402
oh, great, they saved her life.

950
00:51:34,788 --> 00:51:36,950
But the player is beside and they don't arrest him.

951
00:51:37,110 --> 00:51:40,073
And I'm like, why are they not arresting Marcus

952
00:51:40,113 --> 00:51:41,834
when he just punched the lady down?

953
00:51:42,334 --> 00:51:45,597
And he wake up the lady and decide to arrest her instead.

954
00:51:45,617 --> 00:51:49,400
And the reason for this is because she's

955
00:51:49,420 --> 00:51:51,502
the first one that threw a punch to the player

956
00:51:51,562 --> 00:51:53,843
because the player just tried to insult her.

957
00:51:53,964 --> 00:51:55,645
And she got angry and she punched him.

958
00:51:55,985 --> 00:51:57,106
And he punched her back.

959
00:51:57,747 --> 00:52:00,849
But the police decided it was a.

960
00:52:01,812 --> 00:52:05,073
Her fault. Anyways, it was really funny. I liked it.

961
00:52:05,093 --> 00:52:07,794
It reminds me of my entire junior high era.

962
00:52:09,455 --> 00:52:11,436
No, he did it first. Oh, man.

963
00:52:12,056 --> 00:52:12,637
Exactly.

964
00:52:13,197 --> 00:52:16,399
Anyway, I'm obviously, for those of you who know me,

965
00:52:16,419 --> 00:52:20,040
I'm a big fan of emerging AI, and so this kind of stuff is, I love it.

966
00:52:20,420 --> 00:52:22,141
So, thank you again, folks.

967
00:52:22,441 --> 00:52:24,642
Let's thank Roxanne. Fantastic material.

968
00:52:24,863 --> 00:52:25,183
Thank you.
