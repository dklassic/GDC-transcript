1
00:00:04,936 --> 00:00:05,817
Hello, everybody.

2
00:00:05,837 --> 00:00:08,038
How's everyone doing?

3
00:00:09,239 --> 00:00:10,279
Good GDC so far?

4
00:00:10,299 --> 00:00:12,941
It's only day three.

5
00:00:15,123 --> 00:00:15,403
Cool.

6
00:00:15,623 --> 00:00:18,145
So thank you, everyone, for coming along.

7
00:00:19,826 --> 00:00:22,928
This session is Invent a Game, Reinvent Yourself.

8
00:00:24,048 --> 00:00:26,330
And Jen and I both appreciate that you've all come here

9
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:26,830
today.

10
00:00:29,164 --> 00:00:35,988
Cool, so just a quick introduction. My name's Joshua Boggs. I'm the director of a studio

11
00:00:36,028 --> 00:00:42,192
called Love Shack. We made a video game called Framed. I'm also a member of Jen's wonderful

12
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:44,593
Checkpoint and I'll let her introduce herself.

13
00:00:46,354 --> 00:00:51,157
And is my clip on microphone working well enough? Great, because I can't stand here

14
00:00:51,177 --> 00:00:51,577
because then...

15
00:00:52,412 --> 00:00:54,674
You can't see me, I'm vertically challenged.

16
00:00:55,675 --> 00:00:58,357
So I'm Dr. Jennifer Hazel, but even though I graduated

17
00:00:58,397 --> 00:01:00,379
from medical school like six years ago,

18
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:02,080
that still sounds really weird.

19
00:01:03,001 --> 00:01:07,305
Jen is fine, and unlike Josh, I don't have any kind of

20
00:01:07,485 --> 00:01:11,008
accolades or qualifications in the gaming industry,

21
00:01:11,749 --> 00:01:13,891
but my biggest achievement is that I've nearly got

22
00:01:13,911 --> 00:01:15,612
the platinum trophy for Uncharted 4.

23
00:01:17,223 --> 00:01:17,763
Nearly.

24
00:01:17,783 --> 00:01:21,344
What I am good at is watching.

25
00:01:22,144 --> 00:01:24,964
So I'm a medical doctor that now specializes in psychiatry.

26
00:01:25,004 --> 00:01:27,045
And what we do is we watch.

27
00:01:27,365 --> 00:01:28,125
We watch people.

28
00:01:28,185 --> 00:01:30,225
We see how they think, how they behave.

29
00:01:30,285 --> 00:01:32,486
And we try to help them in some way.

30
00:01:32,546 --> 00:01:34,826
And being close to Josh and being

31
00:01:34,866 --> 00:01:37,487
close to my friends and colleagues in the games

32
00:01:37,527 --> 00:01:39,667
industry, I watched.

33
00:01:40,167 --> 00:01:44,568
And I realized that there was this obvious link between games

34
00:01:44,628 --> 00:01:45,508
and mental health.

35
00:01:46,084 --> 00:01:48,908
And it wasn't like it was going in one direction or another.

36
00:01:49,028 --> 00:01:50,950
Sometimes they would be beneficial, sometimes not.

37
00:01:51,171 --> 00:01:55,797
But there was something there that was just out of reach.

38
00:01:55,857 --> 00:01:58,481
Like I just couldn't quite visualize it.

39
00:01:59,142 --> 00:02:01,385
Much like the speed run trophy.

40
00:02:01,926 --> 00:02:02,587
for Uncharted 4.

41
00:02:03,648 --> 00:02:04,549
It was like right there.

42
00:02:04,609 --> 00:02:06,471
So I thought, you know what, no one else is doing this.

43
00:02:06,552 --> 00:02:07,573
I'm gonna be that bridge.

44
00:02:07,673 --> 00:02:08,814
So I found a checkpoint.

45
00:02:09,335 --> 00:02:11,037
Checkpoint's a non-profit organization

46
00:02:11,057 --> 00:02:12,979
that runs out of Australia, which is where we live.

47
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:15,462
And it acts at the intersection

48
00:02:15,502 --> 00:02:16,884
of video games and mental health.

49
00:02:17,359 --> 00:02:19,020
in all of the forms that that takes.

50
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:22,101
So we provide game therapy to vulnerable people

51
00:02:22,121 --> 00:02:24,942
that have mental illness or are otherwise disadvantaged.

52
00:02:25,462 --> 00:02:27,683
We do well-being workshops for members

53
00:02:27,723 --> 00:02:28,883
of the gaming community.

54
00:02:28,963 --> 00:02:31,784
We do well-being rooms at conventions.

55
00:02:31,864 --> 00:02:34,725
We do research and a whole bunch of other stuff.

56
00:02:35,765 --> 00:02:39,827
So that's us, and that's why we're here today, obviously.

57
00:02:40,407 --> 00:02:42,468
This talk does come with a trigger warning.

58
00:02:42,888 --> 00:02:44,248
I think it's important to mention that.

59
00:02:44,828 --> 00:02:47,489
Whenever anybody's talking about mental health in any form,

60
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:51,070
that if anything that we touch on during this talk does

61
00:02:51,751 --> 00:02:53,551
kind of hit you or distress you in some way

62
00:02:53,571 --> 00:02:56,772
and you feel like you need to step out, please do so.

63
00:02:56,792 --> 00:02:59,473
Obviously, this is here to be helpful.

64
00:02:59,973 --> 00:03:02,714
And if at any point it's not helpful anymore,

65
00:03:03,234 --> 00:03:05,075
you know, we're not gonna like chase you down.

66
00:03:05,415 --> 00:03:06,916
We're not gonna take it personally.

67
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:09,196
Please just do what you need to do to keep yourself safe.

68
00:03:10,077 --> 00:03:11,657
And with that, I'll hand back over to Josh.

69
00:03:14,911 --> 00:03:24,897
Okay, so this talk is split into two parts. The first part, I did a talk last year about

70
00:03:24,998 --> 00:03:33,323
my personal experiences and like my psychological, I guess, undiagnosed depression and alcohol

71
00:03:33,403 --> 00:03:35,684
use throughout the development of FRiEND.

72
00:03:37,305 --> 00:03:39,066
That part's gonna be fairly brief.

73
00:03:39,126 --> 00:03:41,627
This is merely like a case study, really.

74
00:03:42,608 --> 00:03:44,269
The second part is why you're all here.

75
00:03:44,289 --> 00:03:48,471
And it's Dr. Jennifer Hazel will be delivering

76
00:03:48,531 --> 00:03:49,712
practical advice for everyone,

77
00:03:49,892 --> 00:03:51,633
how to look after their own mental health.

78
00:03:53,054 --> 00:03:54,875
So with that, we'll just get into it.

79
00:03:56,056 --> 00:03:57,857
So why have this discussion, right?

80
00:03:58,557 --> 00:04:00,138
Sharing stories is important.

81
00:04:01,799 --> 00:04:04,200
Not only do we all do it as our jobs, but...

82
00:04:05,308 --> 00:04:07,310
Sharing stories can help reduce stigma.

83
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:13,136
It's really important for people in the industry and industry leaders to stand up and say,

84
00:04:13,156 --> 00:04:18,322
you know, it's okay to talk about this because then others in the industry will also feel

85
00:04:18,382 --> 00:04:21,665
open and everyone's mental health will, in theory, get better.

86
00:04:23,307 --> 00:04:24,048
The other thing is that...

87
00:04:24,989 --> 00:04:30,214
The games industry is still uniquely young, given how far we've come.

88
00:04:30,234 --> 00:04:33,197
There's pros and cons to that.

89
00:04:33,217 --> 00:04:37,140
The pros is that we can still make changes to make our environment better.

90
00:04:38,461 --> 00:04:47,990
The cons is that we still have things like crunch, which as developers can trigger, I

91
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:50,693
guess, vulnerabilities in mental health.

92
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:56,596
And lastly, you know, we all know those games are a powerful medium for communicating.

93
00:04:57,737 --> 00:05:04,687
And it would be a miss if the developers themselves who are representing mental health

94
00:05:05,228 --> 00:05:06,170
weren't looking after their own.

95
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,362
So yeah, like I said, last year I gave a talk called The Unsatisfied Mind.

96
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:17,145
A lot of people approached and said they got a lot from it.

97
00:05:17,966 --> 00:05:22,309
And that was good, but I personally, and I think others too,

98
00:05:22,869 --> 00:05:25,471
were also hoping for more concrete actions.

99
00:05:26,792 --> 00:05:27,953
You know, what to do next.

100
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:31,795
Like, where do you go when you find yourself feeling similarly?

101
00:05:34,197 --> 00:05:37,039
So we decided to write this talk, yeah.

102
00:05:38,466 --> 00:05:39,426
It's much more analytical.

103
00:05:39,726 --> 00:05:42,468
Like I said before, I'm merely a case study here,

104
00:05:42,548 --> 00:05:46,251
so you may find parallels, you may not,

105
00:05:47,091 --> 00:05:50,974
but Jen's advice is far more applicable in general.

106
00:05:53,915 --> 00:05:56,817
So, there were a few contributing factors

107
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:00,480
that kind of led to my downward depression.

108
00:06:02,188 --> 00:06:04,288
One was obviously the game itself, Framed.

109
00:06:05,489 --> 00:06:07,269
There were expectations of others.

110
00:06:09,209 --> 00:06:12,970
Once we released it, or sorry, once we announced it,

111
00:06:13,730 --> 00:06:15,511
everyone was super excited about it.

112
00:06:16,691 --> 00:06:18,691
And there's certain expectations that come with that.

113
00:06:19,532 --> 00:06:23,733
But more than that, it was the expectations of myself.

114
00:06:24,853 --> 00:06:26,033
I have a personality that is very

115
00:06:27,977 --> 00:06:34,582
perfectionist I guess you could say, and that just mainly served to add more pressure on

116
00:06:34,622 --> 00:06:36,924
the rest of the team.

117
00:06:37,845 --> 00:06:44,970
They obviously too would have been going through their own hardships, and I think, you know,

118
00:06:45,110 --> 00:06:49,694
one of the other major contributing factors, and I think as a society pretty much, right,

119
00:06:49,734 --> 00:06:52,897
like mental health awareness isn't really...

120
00:06:54,454 --> 00:06:57,296
known very much, like, you know, recognising the signs.

121
00:06:59,278 --> 00:07:04,602
So there's no way that they could have noticed, you know, the signs I was exhibiting and I

122
00:07:04,782 --> 00:07:08,265
definitely didn't notice any of their signs either, which is pretty bad.

123
00:07:09,986 --> 00:07:11,087
But yeah, that's why we're doing this talk.

124
00:07:11,607 --> 00:07:16,791
If only there was some sort of, I don't know, charity or service that was promoting mental

125
00:07:16,811 --> 00:07:19,393
health and games, I don't really know.

126
00:07:21,632 --> 00:07:27,593
Anyway, so for this last part, I don't like talking about myself.

127
00:07:27,673 --> 00:07:28,814
This is already kind of annoying.

128
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:39,135
But we're going to get a very qualified doctor to give a more objective overview, maybe,

129
00:07:39,175 --> 00:07:40,896
of my personality and strengths and weaknesses.

130
00:07:40,976 --> 00:07:42,576
So I'll hand it back over to Jen.

131
00:07:42,596 --> 00:07:45,717
I tried so hard to get Josh to write this bit himself.

132
00:07:47,297 --> 00:07:48,217
It just didn't happen.

133
00:07:48,892 --> 00:07:52,975
So from a mental health point of view, it's always really important to look at a person

134
00:07:54,196 --> 00:07:59,181
as an individual that has a longitudinal existence. So obviously someone is born,

135
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:04,706
they live, they have experiences, and that's what leads to the way that they perceive the world and

136
00:08:04,886 --> 00:08:10,871
the way that they adapt to their environment. So, and we've discussed this, so none of this

137
00:08:10,931 --> 00:08:15,115
is going to be new to Josh as I say it. Don't look terrified, it's fine.

138
00:08:15,952 --> 00:08:22,115
So Josh's parents divorced when he was very young and he carried a lot of guilt around for that

139
00:08:22,355 --> 00:08:26,717
and it was something that he never learned to kind of express when he was much younger.

140
00:08:27,638 --> 00:08:32,240
Josh is the eldest sibling and so whilst the family was going through this difficult time he

141
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,003
felt the burden of responsibility over his younger siblings. He wanted to look after them to make

142
00:08:38,023 --> 00:08:42,365
them feel safe and yet simultaneously because he didn't want to burden his parents any further.

143
00:08:43,048 --> 00:08:44,889
through the distress they were already having,

144
00:08:45,029 --> 00:08:47,970
he didn't feel able to offload his emotions onto them.

145
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,531
And that was when he started learning to internalize things.

146
00:08:51,491 --> 00:08:54,232
Around the same time, I think,

147
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:57,133
financially things were quite difficult for the family,

148
00:08:57,714 --> 00:09:00,835
and Josh learned very young the importance of work

149
00:09:01,595 --> 00:09:02,936
and working to survive.

150
00:09:03,456 --> 00:09:05,657
Josh has been employed in some way or another

151
00:09:05,697 --> 00:09:06,177
since he was 12.

152
00:09:07,975 --> 00:09:11,738
So he's now 30, so there's longer working than not working.

153
00:09:11,778 --> 00:09:15,562
So it's a work became not only the driving force behind everything,

154
00:09:15,582 --> 00:09:16,803
but a coping mechanism.

155
00:09:17,063 --> 00:09:20,827
So once you take that away, it's very difficult to know what's left.

156
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:24,171
On the other hand, those things were exceptional skills,

157
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:27,472
that drive to look after others,

158
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:30,293
that drive to keep everything inside,

159
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:33,774
enabled him to handle stress exceptionally well.

160
00:09:34,294 --> 00:09:37,756
It also enabled him to use his creativity

161
00:09:37,776 --> 00:09:38,996
in an objective way.

162
00:09:40,136 --> 00:09:43,177
And simultaneously, he was an exceptionally hard worker.

163
00:09:43,358 --> 00:09:44,658
And of course, everyone here will agree

164
00:09:44,698 --> 00:09:46,219
that to be successful in this industry,

165
00:09:46,239 --> 00:09:47,519
you have to work really hard.

166
00:09:48,052 --> 00:09:53,135
all the time, which has its pros and has its cons.

167
00:09:53,355 --> 00:09:56,757
So what happened next, Josh will tell you a little bit about

168
00:09:56,817 --> 00:09:59,339
and hopefully that analysis should give you

169
00:09:59,899 --> 00:10:04,642
some understanding of why these things occurred.

170
00:10:08,484 --> 00:10:09,985
That's when I was supposed to stand up.

171
00:10:12,826 --> 00:10:13,106
Okay, so.

172
00:10:15,834 --> 00:10:23,760
There were, yeah, I'm sure many people would probably relate to the pressure that comes with development.

173
00:10:25,561 --> 00:10:34,247
I think, like, the motivations behind why success is important kind of delve maybe more closely to, like,

174
00:10:35,275 --> 00:10:41,202
It's like respect from your colleagues, but if that's left unchecked, it can turn very

175
00:10:41,242 --> 00:10:46,449
quickly into basically just a constant seeking of external validation.

176
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:53,599
So, you know, that sort of, I think, the award culture around a lot of things,

177
00:10:53,679 --> 00:10:57,679
and I'd be interested to see whether, like, it happens in film and stuff as well,

178
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:05,921
drives, you know, that sort of, personally, depressive downward spiral.

179
00:11:07,101 --> 00:11:11,322
And the other one was clearly, as Jen was saying about my personality,

180
00:11:13,362 --> 00:11:17,343
this sort of projection of myself onto what I was doing, like,

181
00:11:18,873 --> 00:11:22,295
It took a long time to separate the two and be like,

182
00:11:22,535 --> 00:11:23,735
this is my work and I love it,

183
00:11:24,396 --> 00:11:30,279
but I need to not put all my value as a person in it.

184
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,880
And that's really hard.

185
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,141
I think everyone struggles with that

186
00:11:34,801 --> 00:11:37,023
because you have to really care about what you're making

187
00:11:37,063 --> 00:11:37,843
to make it good, right?

188
00:11:41,125 --> 00:11:41,785
So, as things were,

189
00:11:45,412 --> 00:11:48,953
getting worse during development, I turn to my, I guess,

190
00:11:49,013 --> 00:11:50,814
maladaptive coping strategies.

191
00:11:52,335 --> 00:11:53,956
So things like work.

192
00:11:55,456 --> 00:11:57,677
If things ever get rough, just do work.

193
00:11:58,258 --> 00:11:59,118
Just distracts you.

194
00:12:00,659 --> 00:12:01,739
It's productive.

195
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,542
And yeah, that's pretty much what I used to do a lot.

196
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:08,482
I probably still do it a bit.

197
00:12:11,220 --> 00:12:15,085
And that basically just led to the disruption of other relationships.

198
00:12:16,307 --> 00:12:18,930
You know, friends, family, stuff like that.

199
00:12:19,551 --> 00:12:24,097
So, you know, when you're never there, there's always going to be that schism.

200
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:30,073
And that basically led to alcohol abuse.

201
00:12:30,773 --> 00:12:38,297
And the thing with alcohol abuse, I think it's indicative of a more base...

202
00:12:40,658 --> 00:12:41,138
What's the word?

203
00:12:41,158 --> 00:12:43,379
A need for...

204
00:12:43,399 --> 00:12:44,260
Yeah, like a need.

205
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:53,725
Because basically what happens is, for alcohol use, or gambling, or risky sex, or actual hard drugs...

206
00:12:55,754 --> 00:12:58,096
it's all that, like, that was taking behaviour,

207
00:12:59,097 --> 00:13:00,238
gives you like a head of dopamine,

208
00:13:00,478 --> 00:13:01,959
and then you start becoming addicted to that.

209
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:05,782
So yeah, and then towards the end of it,

210
00:13:05,902 --> 00:13:09,405
then, you know, I kind of got some help and realised,

211
00:13:09,425 --> 00:13:11,306
well, I didn't realise I was diagnosed

212
00:13:11,346 --> 00:13:13,568
with actual clinical depression.

213
00:13:13,668 --> 00:13:18,472
So that was very,

214
00:13:18,572 --> 00:13:19,553
it was very important.

215
00:13:20,608 --> 00:13:22,628
because it was important to acknowledge that there was a problem

216
00:13:24,069 --> 00:13:25,149
and being able to label it

217
00:13:26,389 --> 00:13:31,150
was incredibly valuable, so yes, acknowledging it.

218
00:13:32,971 --> 00:13:33,811
The other thing I guess,

219
00:13:33,831 --> 00:13:35,872
this is going to sound kind of weird,

220
00:13:36,172 --> 00:13:39,333
I guess like as the story that Jin was telling,

221
00:13:40,113 --> 00:13:42,373
it's very difficult for me and I think

222
00:13:43,494 --> 00:13:46,514
it may also be true of other men as well

223
00:13:47,055 --> 00:13:48,575
to accept help from other people.

224
00:13:50,747 --> 00:13:52,308
It's just like the last thing I'll ever do.

225
00:13:52,328 --> 00:13:53,468
It's like ask for help.

226
00:13:53,828 --> 00:13:55,189
I'll just keep doing it myself.

227
00:13:56,850 --> 00:14:00,552
And, but, but, you know, learning to, to, to let that go

228
00:14:00,933 --> 00:14:04,655
and, and yeah, you know, get the help of others

229
00:14:04,715 --> 00:14:05,635
and very close friends.

230
00:14:07,136 --> 00:14:09,798
The other really important thing, as I mentioned before,

231
00:14:10,278 --> 00:14:12,579
because, you know, to be diagnosed with depression,

232
00:14:12,599 --> 00:14:14,781
you have to do at least some form of therapy.

233
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:19,129
was I finally went and got therapy.

234
00:14:19,630 --> 00:14:20,931
And there's many different arms of therapy.

235
00:14:20,971 --> 00:14:25,295
You know, there's like CBT, DBT, ACT

236
00:14:25,355 --> 00:14:29,579
was a form that I personally found quite useful for me.

237
00:14:31,021 --> 00:14:32,422
I'll let, you know, Jen discuss that

238
00:14:32,442 --> 00:14:33,383
during her part of the talk.

239
00:14:34,064 --> 00:14:36,006
And the last part was just actually taking

240
00:14:36,606 --> 00:14:38,468
a long break from work.

241
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:45,363
being able to sit with yourself and not distract myself

242
00:14:46,044 --> 00:14:48,646
was incredibly important to get back to the values

243
00:14:48,706 --> 00:14:52,709
of why I make games, why I got in the industry

244
00:14:53,189 --> 00:14:55,871
as opposed to the things I became addicted to.

245
00:14:58,713 --> 00:15:02,556
And right here, there's only five points here, right?

246
00:15:02,997 --> 00:15:04,318
So it sounds fairly.

247
00:15:06,046 --> 00:15:11,729
trivial but small. But you know this is a long process, over 12, 18 months.

248
00:15:12,649 --> 00:15:19,092
That's almost as long as it took to make the game. So yeah, I just want to make that very clear.

249
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:28,698
And that's me, that's how I'm now doing a lot better. This is obviously anecdotal and I'm

250
00:15:28,998 --> 00:15:32,500
merely basically a test case for what Jen's about to talk about.

251
00:15:35,572 --> 00:15:37,832
And there was one more point.

252
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:39,173
Can't remember it.

253
00:15:39,753 --> 00:15:40,233
That's OK.

254
00:15:40,293 --> 00:15:40,753
That's all right.

255
00:15:41,693 --> 00:15:43,874
So to introduce the wonderful Jen.

256
00:15:44,834 --> 00:15:49,115
And she will provide implementable, lovely advice.

257
00:15:49,135 --> 00:15:52,776
I'm going to start with a really quick story.

258
00:15:54,156 --> 00:15:56,077
Because this talk can get pretty intense.

259
00:15:57,377 --> 00:15:58,277
It can get really heavy.

260
00:15:58,297 --> 00:16:02,658
And can we give Josh a round of applause for doing that again?

261
00:16:02,678 --> 00:16:02,878
Thank you.

262
00:16:09,628 --> 00:16:10,570
Two years in a row.

263
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:14,460
OK, people often ask me how I got into mental health.

264
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:21,773
I trained in Britain, as you could probably tell, and I moved to Australia to start working

265
00:16:21,953 --> 00:16:23,053
in the emergency room.

266
00:16:23,693 --> 00:16:25,233
Medicine is very different in Australia.

267
00:16:25,253 --> 00:16:29,014
I didn't realize quite how different until this story I'm about to tell you.

268
00:16:29,454 --> 00:16:31,195
I was always interested in mental health.

269
00:16:32,435 --> 00:16:36,516
Whenever a patient that needed mental health care came into the department, the other doctors

270
00:16:36,556 --> 00:16:38,676
would give them to me because I found it the most rewarding.

271
00:16:39,137 --> 00:16:41,377
So one day we had a young lady, I think she was about 18.

272
00:16:42,658 --> 00:16:46,261
and she presented what the triage note from the nurse said,

273
00:16:46,321 --> 00:16:47,161
hallucination.

274
00:16:47,842 --> 00:16:48,703
And I was like, okay, cool.

275
00:16:48,743 --> 00:16:50,945
Let's see how I can help this young lady.

276
00:16:51,525 --> 00:16:54,227
So she comes into my examining room and I say,

277
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:54,948
well, how can I help you?

278
00:16:54,968 --> 00:16:56,409
She said, well, there's a spider in my ear.

279
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,311
And I was like, yeah, sure.

280
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:00,392
Sure there is.

281
00:17:00,933 --> 00:17:02,094
You don't see that in England.

282
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:03,074
That's not a thing.

283
00:17:04,415 --> 00:17:05,656
I thought maybe she was having.

284
00:17:06,328 --> 00:17:08,109
a hallucination, a somatic hallucination.

285
00:17:08,129 --> 00:17:09,610
She was feeling something that wasn't there.

286
00:17:10,110 --> 00:17:12,952
But of course, you know, I wanted to have a look,

287
00:17:12,992 --> 00:17:13,593
give it a go.

288
00:17:14,353 --> 00:17:16,194
I'm just gonna get really close to Josh.

289
00:17:17,015 --> 00:17:18,496
So when you look in someone's ear,

290
00:17:18,516 --> 00:17:20,617
this is how close you get.

291
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,299
And there's a magnifying glass.

292
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:26,941
So obviously I had a look and there's the,

293
00:17:27,642 --> 00:17:30,724
like this monster of a spider with huge red fangs.

294
00:17:31,584 --> 00:17:33,706
And being the pillar of dignity.

295
00:17:35,060 --> 00:17:40,003
and professionalism I am, I screamed through the otoscope on the floor and ran out of the

296
00:17:40,043 --> 00:17:40,283
room.

297
00:17:42,785 --> 00:17:45,266
And that was the day I decided that I would do mental health.

298
00:17:50,329 --> 00:17:54,391
So, no, do not call me, now's not the time.

299
00:17:57,172 --> 00:17:58,513
This is called the AAA model.

300
00:17:59,414 --> 00:18:02,395
It's something that I pioneered for Checkpoint.

301
00:18:03,375 --> 00:18:06,857
specifically to try and help game developers and other

302
00:18:06,897 --> 00:18:08,858
members of the technological community.

303
00:18:10,079 --> 00:18:13,541
It's a model that is filled with education and practical

304
00:18:13,621 --> 00:18:14,681
points of intervention.

305
00:18:15,102 --> 00:18:17,203
And everything that's in there is evidence-based.

306
00:18:18,804 --> 00:18:22,226
The reason that I say I've designed it for game devs is

307
00:18:22,286 --> 00:18:27,369
because it's brief, it's memorable, and it focuses on

308
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:29,690
the three key parts of well-being, which is your

309
00:18:29,710 --> 00:18:31,671
psychological health, your physical health, and your

310
00:18:31,711 --> 00:18:32,292
social health.

311
00:18:33,437 --> 00:18:35,117
It's not actual medical advice,

312
00:18:35,398 --> 00:18:37,339
so this isn't a prescription.

313
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:41,621
It's designed to provide the audience with autonomy.

314
00:18:42,141 --> 00:18:43,382
So you see this talk, you think,

315
00:18:43,662 --> 00:18:45,623
I can kind of see a bit of that in me,

316
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:48,144
or that tip, that technique,

317
00:18:48,604 --> 00:18:50,245
looks like I might find it useful.

318
00:18:50,685 --> 00:18:51,806
You go away, you have a read.

319
00:18:52,226 --> 00:18:53,867
You know, you Google the terms.

320
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,868
Everything that's in this talk has quite detailed notes

321
00:18:56,928 --> 00:18:58,209
that will be available on the vault,

322
00:18:58,549 --> 00:19:00,650
along with links to the studies that we refer to.

323
00:19:01,041 --> 00:19:03,645
and some helpful websites that you might find of benefit.

324
00:19:05,647 --> 00:19:08,732
And the model describes a three-step process.

325
00:19:09,713 --> 00:19:11,636
Audit, accept, and act.

326
00:19:12,418 --> 00:19:16,181
So to audit, what we are doing is taking a step back

327
00:19:16,761 --> 00:19:20,244
and without judgment or malice, just seeing what's there.

328
00:19:20,865 --> 00:19:22,826
What's in there inside, what's there outside,

329
00:19:23,387 --> 00:19:24,348
and just having a look.

330
00:19:25,068 --> 00:19:26,710
And then we move on and we accept that.

331
00:19:26,970 --> 00:19:29,052
And we go, you know what, whatever is there,

332
00:19:29,072 --> 00:19:30,873
I'm gonna be kind to myself.

333
00:19:31,614 --> 00:19:32,835
That's fine, that's okay.

334
00:19:33,375 --> 00:19:35,137
That's what's happening right now.

335
00:19:35,637 --> 00:19:36,318
And just let it be.

336
00:19:37,778 --> 00:19:39,599
And then we move on and we act.

337
00:19:39,979 --> 00:19:43,261
So we introduce some very superficial basic techniques

338
00:19:43,301 --> 00:19:45,242
that you can implement today,

339
00:19:45,263 --> 00:19:48,104
that you can go away and learn how to.

340
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:52,441
help yourself to optimize your well-being at any given time.

341
00:19:52,882 --> 00:19:57,024
And the beauty of this model is that you can use it however often you want.

342
00:19:57,724 --> 00:20:02,527
If you're a very stoic person that only ever gets stressed once a month, and please teach

343
00:20:02,567 --> 00:20:07,069
me how if you are that person, you could use it once a month, or you can use it once a

344
00:20:07,109 --> 00:20:09,050
week, or you can use it every five minutes.

345
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:09,970
That's the beauty of it.

346
00:20:11,431 --> 00:20:13,792
So the first step is to audit.

347
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:19,639
This starts hard and gets easier every time you do it.

348
00:20:21,180 --> 00:20:25,164
It's based on a psychological technique called mindfulness,

349
00:20:25,244 --> 00:20:26,725
which I'm sure a lot of you have heard of.

350
00:20:27,986 --> 00:20:30,548
And a good quote is that mindfulness concerns

351
00:20:30,668 --> 00:20:34,591
a clear awareness of one's inner and outer worlds,

352
00:20:35,152 --> 00:20:39,215
including their thoughts, emotions, sensations, actions,

353
00:20:39,255 --> 00:20:40,076
and surroundings.

354
00:20:41,173 --> 00:20:43,635
as they exist at any given moment.

355
00:20:44,455 --> 00:20:49,158
So what we've extrapolated from that is when we audit our current situation, we look externally,

356
00:20:49,799 --> 00:20:54,402
and then we look internally at what's ongoing and chronic and happening all the time for

357
00:20:54,502 --> 00:20:57,163
us and what's kind of passing by, what's transient.

358
00:20:59,725 --> 00:21:03,928
There is no way I can do a talk about mental health and game development if I don't mention

359
00:21:04,008 --> 00:21:04,308
crunch.

360
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:08,806
Unfortunately, it's not something that I can do anything about.

361
00:21:08,866 --> 00:21:12,348
I wish I could come in here and wave a magic wand and help you guys not ever have to crunch

362
00:21:12,388 --> 00:21:13,729
again, but I can't.

363
00:21:14,930 --> 00:21:22,535
What I can do is give you tools for your psychological toolbox to help you recognize the signs that

364
00:21:22,575 --> 00:21:27,699
it's happening and to help you to know what to do about it if it is happening.

365
00:21:27,959 --> 00:21:30,401
Because we can't make it go away, right?

366
00:21:32,828 --> 00:21:36,089
I worked with an organization in Australia called SANE,

367
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:39,430
and they do a program called the Mindful Employers Program,

368
00:21:39,450 --> 00:21:42,332
which helps all organizations

369
00:21:42,372 --> 00:21:44,332
to create mental health plans for their employees.

370
00:21:44,953 --> 00:21:46,293
And I was sitting down with them saying,

371
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:47,494
how can we do this for Game Dev?

372
00:21:48,294 --> 00:21:52,336
And I said, because Game Dev, they do a lot of crunch.

373
00:21:53,036 --> 00:21:55,097
And this lovely lady, she bursts out laughing,

374
00:21:55,117 --> 00:21:55,877
she said, crunch?

375
00:21:55,997 --> 00:21:57,438
I haven't heard that word in 10 years.

376
00:21:57,458 --> 00:21:59,999
Because no one else does it anymore.

377
00:22:01,238 --> 00:22:02,539
in the industries that they deal with.

378
00:22:03,339 --> 00:22:05,119
So, why don't they do it?

379
00:22:05,579 --> 00:22:06,420
Because it doesn't work.

380
00:22:06,580 --> 00:22:07,740
It works for about two weeks,

381
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,001
and then after that you reduce your productivity,

382
00:22:10,121 --> 00:22:12,001
you reduce the financial benefit,

383
00:22:12,101 --> 00:22:13,901
and you actually burn out your employees,

384
00:22:14,021 --> 00:22:15,182
which has a knock-on effect.

385
00:22:16,322 --> 00:22:21,043
So, everybody knows that crunch is linked to burnout.

386
00:22:21,243 --> 00:22:23,244
That's kind of reasonably basic stuff.

387
00:22:23,704 --> 00:22:24,664
But what is burnout?

388
00:22:25,434 --> 00:22:27,215
It's a term that we kind of use flippantly.

389
00:22:27,816 --> 00:22:29,357
It's a biological process.

390
00:22:29,457 --> 00:22:32,900
We've done studies, fMRI and SPECT studies,

391
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:35,402
that show that in people who are on the spectrum

392
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:38,104
of being burned out, there is reduced functional connectivity

393
00:22:38,144 --> 00:22:40,926
between the amygdala and their prefrontal cortex.

394
00:22:41,386 --> 00:22:44,469
So that's the lizard brain, the instinct feelings part,

395
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:47,751
and the part that makes you act or run.

396
00:22:48,472 --> 00:22:55,978
Basically, it reduces how well and how quickly you can respond to emotional stressors,

397
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:00,402
which means that you feel emotions less or you're able to regulate them less,

398
00:23:00,902 --> 00:23:06,567
leading to emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and feeling like you're just not good enough.

399
00:23:08,209 --> 00:23:12,633
Of course, that's going to have an effect on the individual. They might come to work less,

400
00:23:12,653 --> 00:23:16,356
and when they are at work, they're not there cognitively.

401
00:23:17,963 --> 00:23:20,625
And then everybody else in the team has to pick up the slack,

402
00:23:21,485 --> 00:23:22,946
which is not that one person's fault,

403
00:23:22,967 --> 00:23:23,827
and it's not their fault.

404
00:23:23,867 --> 00:23:25,268
But what happens is there's this kind of

405
00:23:25,408 --> 00:23:26,729
exponential burning out.

406
00:23:26,969 --> 00:23:29,251
Is that everybody around them gets burned out too,

407
00:23:29,771 --> 00:23:30,872
and then it gets worse and worse,

408
00:23:30,972 --> 00:23:32,654
carries on to the organization itself.

409
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:37,397
And the ultimate effect is that there's decreased output

410
00:23:37,497 --> 00:23:38,418
and decreased profit.

411
00:23:40,179 --> 00:23:41,460
And everybody is sad.

412
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:54,249
It actually costs the US economy between $150 and $300 billion a year, depending on estimates.

413
00:23:54,749 --> 00:23:59,292
So this is a real thing that has real consequences for not only the people, but the companies

414
00:23:59,313 --> 00:24:02,155
that run, the people that run the companies, sorry.

415
00:24:04,737 --> 00:24:13,223
Stress is the next thing that that leads into, because stress kind of is what causes burnout,

416
00:24:13,303 --> 00:24:13,543
I guess.

417
00:24:15,706 --> 00:24:19,888
And I've got a very fluctuating relationship with stress.

418
00:24:20,488 --> 00:24:22,749
Sometimes I think it's great, sometimes I hate it.

419
00:24:23,589 --> 00:24:27,850
And I guess what I want to teach you guys

420
00:24:28,050 --> 00:24:31,251
is that stress, again, unavoidable, I can't take it away.

421
00:24:31,752 --> 00:24:33,452
But it doesn't have to be damaging,

422
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,733
it doesn't have to be destructive.

423
00:24:34,773 --> 00:24:38,834
In fact, you can use it and you can make it work for you.

424
00:24:40,252 --> 00:24:42,192
Again, it's a physiological response.

425
00:24:42,272 --> 00:24:44,053
It's something that happens in your body

426
00:24:44,113 --> 00:24:46,494
that you've got no control over whatsoever.

427
00:24:47,174 --> 00:24:48,955
Impulses are released from the amygdala,

428
00:24:49,175 --> 00:24:51,316
again, the lizard brain, the hippocampus,

429
00:24:51,356 --> 00:24:54,998
which controls memory, and the prefrontal cortex.

430
00:24:55,638 --> 00:24:57,979
That travels down to the adrenal glands,

431
00:24:57,999 --> 00:24:59,259
which are just above the kidneys,

432
00:24:59,619 --> 00:25:02,521
and they release cortisol and adrenaline,

433
00:25:02,541 --> 00:25:05,402
or I think you guys call it epinephrine,

434
00:25:05,882 --> 00:25:06,082
which...

435
00:25:07,316 --> 00:25:10,757
is what your body needs if you're standing in front of a saber-toothed tiger

436
00:25:10,777 --> 00:25:14,459
to know whether you need to run for your life or fight for your life.

437
00:25:14,939 --> 00:25:19,661
So your gut stops working, your muscles get oxygenated, they get charged,

438
00:25:19,681 --> 00:25:23,603
your senses get heightened, your heart rate increases, your respiratory rate increases.

439
00:25:24,168 --> 00:25:27,209
So everything is on this kind of alert for life or death.

440
00:25:27,949 --> 00:25:31,910
But we don't really see sabertooth tigers so much anymore,

441
00:25:32,410 --> 00:25:34,790
which means that this physiological response

442
00:25:34,890 --> 00:25:36,631
is mostly inappropriate.

443
00:25:37,291 --> 00:25:39,571
And because the stress that we're dealing with

444
00:25:39,591 --> 00:25:41,552
is the stress of our occupations,

445
00:25:41,592 --> 00:25:43,792
which you have to do for at least 40 hours a week

446
00:25:43,812 --> 00:25:44,452
for most of us,

447
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:47,213
this is something that becomes chronic and prolonged.

448
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:50,134
But it's not all bad.

449
00:25:52,034 --> 00:25:53,134
It can be beneficial.

450
00:25:54,470 --> 00:25:59,811
So I saw this talk by Kelly McGonigal, who's Jane McGonigal's sister.

451
00:26:00,111 --> 00:26:01,092
What an amazing family.

452
00:26:01,812 --> 00:26:10,914
About how your attitude to stress actually modifies the outcomes of stress.

453
00:26:11,335 --> 00:26:15,216
So if you look at stress and you're like, hey, that means I'm going to work hard.

454
00:26:15,776 --> 00:26:18,837
You got positive reappraisal of that process.

455
00:26:19,537 --> 00:26:22,418
Actually, any of the negative health outcomes are negated.

456
00:26:23,163 --> 00:26:26,566
people who think stress is terrible and then they can't deal with it,

457
00:26:27,207 --> 00:26:28,027
they die younger.

458
00:26:29,028 --> 00:26:30,850
And when people think stress is good,

459
00:26:32,452 --> 00:26:33,933
same as the rest of the population.

460
00:26:34,453 --> 00:26:37,656
And this was a study based on tens of thousands of people, like this is real stuff.

461
00:26:38,437 --> 00:26:41,640
It blew my mind when I learned that. I thought stress was the worst thing in the world.

462
00:26:43,042 --> 00:26:46,545
And so how do you think differently about stress? Think about how you think.

463
00:26:47,425 --> 00:26:49,026
Are you a pessimist or an optimist?

464
00:26:49,567 --> 00:26:51,108
Do you think very rigidly?

465
00:26:51,148 --> 00:26:53,450
Is it difficult to kind of adapt and change your mind?

466
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,932
Are you an all or nothing thinker,

467
00:26:56,052 --> 00:26:58,834
which means it's something's either never happening

468
00:26:58,934 --> 00:27:02,237
or always happening and there's no in between part?

469
00:27:02,838 --> 00:27:04,239
Think about those different ways

470
00:27:04,279 --> 00:27:05,740
that you assess each situation

471
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:07,462
because those people who have kind of like

472
00:27:07,922 --> 00:27:10,184
negative thought processes towards stress,

473
00:27:10,764 --> 00:27:13,446
it actually reduces your threshold for being stressed

474
00:27:14,207 --> 00:27:16,289
and it makes you feel.

475
00:27:16,999 --> 00:27:20,320
that physiology much more acutely.

476
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:23,440
So I've written Yerkes-Dodson curve.

477
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,841
You probably all know this,

478
00:27:24,901 --> 00:27:26,461
it's also called the stress curve,

479
00:27:26,581 --> 00:27:28,501
but that's the proper medical name.

480
00:27:29,862 --> 00:27:31,222
And this is the curve,

481
00:27:31,822 --> 00:27:34,842
which means that the more stress increases,

482
00:27:35,603 --> 00:27:37,783
the more productive you are until a point,

483
00:27:38,483 --> 00:27:41,804
and then it goes away and you start getting less productive

484
00:27:41,864 --> 00:27:42,924
because you're too stressed out.

485
00:27:44,102 --> 00:27:46,424
This is pretty basic stuff, but what I want to...

486
00:27:46,444 --> 00:27:49,807
Well, not tell you, what I want to remind you, I guess,

487
00:27:50,348 --> 00:27:54,491
is that curve can exist anywhere on that X-axis.

488
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:56,433
So you can go all the way to the left

489
00:27:56,473 --> 00:27:59,116
and be someone like me that gets super stressed out

490
00:27:59,176 --> 00:28:03,740
super quickly, but also gets super effective super quickly.

491
00:28:05,062 --> 00:28:08,307
And once you learn to recognize that, you can deal with it.

492
00:28:08,727 --> 00:28:11,511
Or you might be the other way, that you can handle a whole lot,

493
00:28:11,551 --> 00:28:14,355
but you don't really work that hard until the pressure's really on.

494
00:28:14,735 --> 00:28:16,197
And how could you maybe bring that down?

495
00:28:18,031 --> 00:28:20,512
So the long-term effects of unchecked stress

496
00:28:20,833 --> 00:28:23,494
include emotional, cognitive, physical,

497
00:28:23,514 --> 00:28:24,555
and behavioral effects.

498
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:27,777
And again, this is something that you guys almost certainly

499
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:29,838
know, but maybe there'll be a couple of things in here

500
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:30,338
that are new.

501
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,240
So the emotional effects of stress

502
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:36,622
include anxiety and depression, but also anger, apathy,

503
00:28:36,642 --> 00:28:37,983
just feeling I don't care anymore,

504
00:28:38,643 --> 00:28:40,504
acopia, and just not being able to deal

505
00:28:40,544 --> 00:28:41,925
with basic things in life.

506
00:28:42,245 --> 00:28:44,166
It's like the straw that broke the camel's back, right?

507
00:28:45,723 --> 00:28:48,049
You can actually have problems with your memory,

508
00:28:48,089 --> 00:28:49,734
with your cognition, with your judgment.

509
00:28:49,934 --> 00:28:51,338
You're suddenly making poor decisions.

510
00:28:51,378 --> 00:28:52,140
You don't know why.

511
00:28:53,113 --> 00:28:57,095
and amazingly can have physical effects on the body

512
00:28:57,515 --> 00:29:00,216
in ways that we perhaps wouldn't anticipate.

513
00:29:00,716 --> 00:29:03,337
So you can actually get skin conditions like eczema.

514
00:29:03,797 --> 00:29:05,618
Ladies can get endometriosis.

515
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,860
You can have all sorts of sleep problems

516
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:09,880
and frequent illness.

517
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:12,081
And of course the behavioral effects

518
00:29:12,121 --> 00:29:14,122
that we kind of touched on before include

519
00:29:14,542 --> 00:29:17,763
substance use and also social withdrawal, sorry.

520
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:23,927
When we look internally, it's important to look at our coping styles.

521
00:29:26,149 --> 00:29:26,949
How do you cope?

522
00:29:28,270 --> 00:29:29,271
What is coping?

523
00:29:29,531 --> 00:29:30,351
What does that mean?

524
00:29:31,732 --> 00:29:37,896
Coping in a kind of very bland clinical sense is the way that we alleviate pain and distress.

525
00:29:39,257 --> 00:29:44,840
It's the way that we adapt to the challenges that life throws at us.

526
00:29:46,021 --> 00:29:49,443
And they can be good or bad or both.

527
00:29:50,877 --> 00:29:55,479
And that might change depending on what day it is or what the situation is.

528
00:29:57,640 --> 00:30:01,141
There's way too many coping strategies to actually stand here and tell you about.

529
00:30:01,501 --> 00:30:05,343
Freud described at least 20. He did like talking a lot.

530
00:30:05,443 --> 00:30:07,564
But yes, there are a lot.

531
00:30:08,044 --> 00:30:11,465
But a really good kind of basic model is this first bullet point here,

532
00:30:11,485 --> 00:30:15,086
which is whether it's appraisal, problem, emotion, or occupation focus.

533
00:30:15,146 --> 00:30:18,568
So it kind of takes all of these different defense mechanisms

534
00:30:18,608 --> 00:30:20,268
and pops them into neat little categories.

535
00:30:21,002 --> 00:30:25,924
Appraisal focused coping is how you look at the situation.

536
00:30:26,084 --> 00:30:29,406
So perhaps there's a stressful event and then you go,

537
00:30:29,466 --> 00:30:30,706
well, you know what, could be worse.

538
00:30:31,406 --> 00:30:33,347
Every cloud has a silver lining, that sort of thing.

539
00:30:34,248 --> 00:30:40,010
Problem focused is, I guess, the way I solve things

540
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,891
and it can be good and bad.

541
00:30:43,571 --> 00:30:46,613
So for example, when I moved to Australia,

542
00:30:47,502 --> 00:30:51,324
I get bills from the UK still, and I don't like bills.

543
00:30:51,765 --> 00:30:53,045
I'm that sort of person that goes,

544
00:30:53,105 --> 00:30:54,526
right, I'm gonna sort that out, like, now.

545
00:30:55,687 --> 00:30:58,369
But I can't, because it's like 12 hours ago there.

546
00:30:59,049 --> 00:31:01,010
So I just have to sit and look at this piece of paper

547
00:31:01,050 --> 00:31:02,731
and just wait for 12 hours

548
00:31:02,771 --> 00:31:04,172
until I can do something about it.

549
00:31:04,592 --> 00:31:06,473
So I had to learn that kind of, well, yeah,

550
00:31:06,493 --> 00:31:08,414
problem-solving, good coping mechanism,

551
00:31:08,695 --> 00:31:10,936
but not if you can't solve that problem immediately.

552
00:31:11,316 --> 00:31:13,397
I'm probably gonna need to learn something else

553
00:31:13,858 --> 00:31:16,199
to alleviate that distress until I can deal with it.

554
00:31:17,391 --> 00:31:20,133
Emotion focused, again, can be good, can be bad.

555
00:31:20,613 --> 00:31:23,956
Some people, they seek support from their friends and family.

556
00:31:24,396 --> 00:31:26,858
Other people might do self-harming behaviors

557
00:31:26,978 --> 00:31:28,279
to alleviate that emotion.

558
00:31:29,279 --> 00:31:31,381
And occupation focused, again, something

559
00:31:31,421 --> 00:31:32,581
that we talked about with Josh.

560
00:31:33,582 --> 00:31:36,384
You can use work as a coping mechanism,

561
00:31:36,444 --> 00:31:39,866
and that is a very positive thing to do in most cases.

562
00:31:40,307 --> 00:31:42,568
It's a really, really good way of getting your mind off stuff.

563
00:31:42,828 --> 00:31:44,309
And hopefully, you like what you do,

564
00:31:44,630 --> 00:31:46,331
so it's going to cheer you up in a way.

565
00:31:47,312 --> 00:31:48,832
but what if you're doing it so much

566
00:31:48,892 --> 00:31:50,533
that you've just neglected everything else?

567
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:52,754
That's when that positive coping mechanism

568
00:31:52,794 --> 00:31:54,095
becomes maladaptive.

569
00:31:54,995 --> 00:31:58,277
So have a think, have a think about the way that you cope.

570
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,837
What tools do you use?

571
00:32:00,398 --> 00:32:03,159
Maybe have a look at the slides in the vault

572
00:32:03,199 --> 00:32:05,060
where we've got a list of all the different ones,

573
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,701
or do some research yourself, you just pop it into Google,

574
00:32:08,381 --> 00:32:12,343
and find out what do you use, and is it helpful or unhelpful,

575
00:32:12,383 --> 00:32:14,824
and how could you perhaps optimize it?

576
00:32:18,618 --> 00:32:24,502
It's very important when we talk about mental health to approach actual clinical diagnoses.

577
00:32:25,623 --> 00:32:28,986
I only touch on depression and anxiety because I wish I had a whole day but I don't, I've

578
00:32:29,006 --> 00:32:29,986
got 45 minutes.

579
00:32:31,428 --> 00:32:34,870
So these two, depression and anxiety, are the most common.

580
00:32:36,551 --> 00:32:42,496
If we imagine that the room is the demographic of the world, if you split you guys down the

581
00:32:42,536 --> 00:32:46,679
middle, 50% of you will have a mental health issue at some point in your life.

582
00:32:47,089 --> 00:32:49,151
a quarter of you, it will be this year.

583
00:32:49,692 --> 00:32:51,974
So, I mean, we're talking about something that's endemic,

584
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:53,195
like this happens all the time,

585
00:32:53,295 --> 00:32:55,117
and it will be probably one of these two,

586
00:32:55,518 --> 00:32:56,899
and you might not even recognize it.

587
00:32:58,220 --> 00:33:00,703
Anxiety is exceptionally common,

588
00:33:01,323 --> 00:33:02,745
exceptionally treatable,

589
00:33:03,345 --> 00:33:05,668
presents in a whole bunch of different ways,

590
00:33:06,248 --> 00:33:07,770
ways that you might not even realize.

591
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:12,543
So everybody knows about generalized anxiety disorder,

592
00:33:12,643 --> 00:33:14,345
social disorder, panic disorder,

593
00:33:15,406 --> 00:33:17,868
which usually present with these sorts of symptoms.

594
00:33:17,948 --> 00:33:20,330
So lots of worrying, ruminating,

595
00:33:20,831 --> 00:33:22,592
crunching over the same thing in your head.

596
00:33:23,373 --> 00:33:25,355
You can get irritable, have that kind of,

597
00:33:25,635 --> 00:33:28,898
we call it in medicine a feeling of impending doom,

598
00:33:29,378 --> 00:33:30,499
which sounds very dramatic.

599
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:33,162
But it's kind of like that feeling in your tummy

600
00:33:33,202 --> 00:33:34,463
that something's about to go wrong.

601
00:33:35,896 --> 00:33:40,162
There can be physical symptoms that are very often mistaken for an actual medical problem.

602
00:33:40,802 --> 00:33:44,748
And psychosomatic is a word that means, you know, a physical symptom in response to a

603
00:33:44,788 --> 00:33:45,910
psychological stressor.

604
00:33:46,290 --> 00:33:47,432
The symptom's real.

605
00:33:48,253 --> 00:33:52,479
It's not imaginary, like the pain is real, the tummy problems are real.

606
00:33:53,604 --> 00:33:55,944
They don't have a biological cause as such.

607
00:33:56,004 --> 00:33:57,825
They have a cause that started in the mind.

608
00:33:57,865 --> 00:33:59,385
And it's all to do with that stress response

609
00:33:59,445 --> 00:34:00,725
I was talking about earlier.

610
00:34:01,205 --> 00:34:02,586
You know, when you've got all these signals

611
00:34:02,626 --> 00:34:05,506
and these hormones racing around your body all the time,

612
00:34:06,066 --> 00:34:08,207
there's gonna be a physical response.

613
00:34:10,147 --> 00:34:12,987
The thing about anxiety is everybody gets anxious,

614
00:34:13,187 --> 00:34:13,668
everybody.

615
00:34:15,008 --> 00:34:16,208
But when is it a problem?

616
00:34:18,188 --> 00:34:20,629
Someone could have a diagnosable anxiety disorder

617
00:34:20,809 --> 00:34:22,109
when not feeling.

618
00:34:23,067 --> 00:34:26,448
is intrusive, pervasive, and leads to avoidance.

619
00:34:27,269 --> 00:34:28,909
So when it's coming in when you don't want it,

620
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:31,251
and that's happening a lot,

621
00:34:31,811 --> 00:34:33,872
and then your behavior is responding to that.

622
00:34:33,992 --> 00:34:36,493
So the classic example is a panic attack

623
00:34:36,513 --> 00:34:38,974
or a panic disorder due to an open space.

624
00:34:39,375 --> 00:34:40,635
You start worrying about it,

625
00:34:40,755 --> 00:34:42,556
and then you start avoiding open spaces.

626
00:34:43,517 --> 00:34:45,398
Whereas, for example,

627
00:34:45,718 --> 00:34:47,679
I was very anxious about coming on stage,

628
00:34:48,299 --> 00:34:49,139
but I still did it.

629
00:34:49,660 --> 00:34:51,520
So is that an anxiety disorder?

630
00:34:51,561 --> 00:34:52,241
Probably not.

631
00:34:54,521 --> 00:34:57,042
And it's important to consider the other types of anxiety

632
00:34:57,302 --> 00:35:01,084
that aren't as commonly discussed, like PTSD and OCD.

633
00:35:01,244 --> 00:35:02,905
They are types of anxiety disorder.

634
00:35:02,945 --> 00:35:05,706
The treatment is largely the same or in similar veins.

635
00:35:06,326 --> 00:35:08,387
So these are things also to think about

636
00:35:08,447 --> 00:35:11,288
that you might not consider that to be an anxiety disorder,

637
00:35:11,308 --> 00:35:13,369
but perhaps if you were to kind of look it up

638
00:35:13,509 --> 00:35:15,830
and maybe go and get the help,

639
00:35:16,411 --> 00:35:19,172
you would realize that they're so treatable

640
00:35:19,452 --> 00:35:21,493
and there's so many people that are experiencing it

641
00:35:21,513 --> 00:35:22,553
and you're not alone at all.

642
00:35:25,687 --> 00:35:27,508
And of course, depression.

643
00:35:29,448 --> 00:35:34,731
I don't think that I would be controversial at all by saying that the game-developing

644
00:35:34,811 --> 00:35:37,352
community is largely made up of men.

645
00:35:39,093 --> 00:35:41,654
That's not a bad thing or a good thing.

646
00:35:41,694 --> 00:35:43,075
It just is what it is.

647
00:35:44,456 --> 00:35:49,058
And men don't talk about their feelings as much.

648
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,222
they don't share with their friends as much,

649
00:35:53,962 --> 00:35:57,425
and when they get depression, sometimes it presents differently

650
00:35:57,465 --> 00:35:59,808
to how you see it on the telly or how you see it in women.

651
00:36:00,388 --> 00:36:04,472
Men don't get so much the kind of crying and emotional symptoms.

652
00:36:04,512 --> 00:36:07,654
Men get withdrawn and they might get irritable.

653
00:36:09,296 --> 00:36:10,577
They might feel very guilty.

654
00:36:11,887 --> 00:36:16,988
hopeless or despairing and keep all of that inside.

655
00:36:17,629 --> 00:36:19,689
So I think it's really important

656
00:36:19,709 --> 00:36:20,809
in the game development community

657
00:36:20,849 --> 00:36:22,890
that we really do advocate for men's mental health

658
00:36:23,850 --> 00:36:29,051
because it is so important and so under addressed

659
00:36:29,731 --> 00:36:32,012
and you guys are as important as us.

660
00:36:32,212 --> 00:36:34,132
So everybody should have a chance

661
00:36:34,232 --> 00:36:35,613
to have the ultimate wellbeing.

662
00:36:39,404 --> 00:36:41,065
diagram on the left.

663
00:36:41,285 --> 00:36:42,605
I unfortunately couldn't credit,

664
00:36:42,625 --> 00:36:43,646
cause I couldn't find who did it,

665
00:36:43,686 --> 00:36:45,967
but it's such a beautiful representation

666
00:36:45,987 --> 00:36:47,448
of the public perception of depression

667
00:36:47,508 --> 00:36:49,248
versus what people actually experience.

668
00:36:49,508 --> 00:36:50,489
It's not just being sad,

669
00:36:50,509 --> 00:36:55,071
there's like all this other stuff as well as being sad.

670
00:36:55,271 --> 00:36:57,912
And again, like anxiety, it's so treatable.

671
00:36:59,016 --> 00:37:02,277
It's so treatable and all it needs

672
00:37:02,898 --> 00:37:05,098
is that kind of reaching out process.

673
00:37:05,859 --> 00:37:08,540
So if you feel like this is you or someone you know,

674
00:37:09,060 --> 00:37:10,120
take that first step.

675
00:37:12,041 --> 00:37:14,782
Okay, so we're gonna move on

676
00:37:15,543 --> 00:37:19,144
to the acceptance part of our talk,

677
00:37:19,384 --> 00:37:21,105
which involves us taking what we've learned

678
00:37:21,145 --> 00:37:24,886
and removing any judgment or feeling about it,

679
00:37:24,946 --> 00:37:25,126
just.

680
00:37:26,016 --> 00:37:29,059
This is what it is, it's there, so what?

681
00:37:30,380 --> 00:37:32,562
You have to kind of learn to forgive yourself

682
00:37:33,182 --> 00:37:36,205
and let it go, as Elsa might say.

683
00:37:37,286 --> 00:37:39,308
Look at it with a peaceful curiosity.

684
00:37:40,428 --> 00:37:42,350
It's really hard, but really powerful

685
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:43,571
once you learn how to do this.

686
00:37:43,891 --> 00:37:45,173
It takes a lot of practice.

687
00:37:46,634 --> 00:37:49,997
So we've got a mindfulness exercise

688
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:51,198
that takes about three minutes.

689
00:37:51,258 --> 00:37:53,220
If you're not into it, it's only three minutes long.

690
00:37:55,708 --> 00:37:59,050
hope this is going to work because we couldn't get the microphone to work so I might just like,

691
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:04,271
do you want to hold it down? So this is an exercise from

692
00:38:04,291 --> 00:38:11,173
an app called Stop, Breathe and Think. We're not affiliated with them at all but I wish that we

693
00:38:11,193 --> 00:38:17,395
were because they're awesome. Should we give it a go? Yeah, we'll see if it does. Oh, I'm not

694
00:38:17,435 --> 00:38:22,717
connected to the internet. Mindful breathing.

695
00:38:25,137 --> 00:38:27,737
Close your eyes and rest your hands on your knees.

696
00:38:30,918 --> 00:38:34,159
Bring your attention to the touch of your body on your seat.

697
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:40,441
Feel the weight of your body on your chair or cushion.

698
00:38:44,003 --> 00:38:47,404
Make sure that your back is straight and that you're comfortable.

699
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,606
Take a few deep breaths.

700
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:01,071
While you're breathing deeply, relax your shoulders,

701
00:39:03,052 --> 00:39:07,215
your stomach muscles, the muscles in your face,

702
00:39:09,276 --> 00:39:12,098
your hands, and your legs.

703
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,501
Let go of all the tightness in your body.

704
00:39:23,605 --> 00:39:25,787
Now bring your attention back to your breath.

705
00:39:28,140 --> 00:39:34,303
Notice what it feels like as it enters through your nose, goes down through your throat,

706
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:40,025
filling your lungs, and back out through your nose.

707
00:39:44,627 --> 00:39:51,150
Notice your stomach and chest rise and fall each time you breathe in and each time you

708
00:39:51,170 --> 00:39:51,650
breathe out.

709
00:39:53,451 --> 00:39:56,732
And just allow your breathing to be natural and relaxed.

710
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:06,335
Now bring your attention to the feeling of your breath in your nose.

711
00:40:09,196 --> 00:40:12,558
Feel your breath as it comes in and goes out.

712
00:40:15,219 --> 00:40:22,261
Just focus on this sensation, paying attention to each time you breathe in and each time

713
00:40:22,281 --> 00:40:23,121
you breathe out.

714
00:40:27,323 --> 00:40:30,264
As you inhale, maybe your breath feels cool.

715
00:40:32,296 --> 00:40:35,818
And as you exhale, maybe it feels a little warmer.

716
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:45,702
When your mind wanders, or if you become distracted,

717
00:40:47,122 --> 00:40:48,823
just notice what's going on in your head,

718
00:40:50,064 --> 00:40:53,125
and then gently bring your attention back to your breath,

719
00:40:53,805 --> 00:40:56,266
going in and out.

720
00:41:00,348 --> 00:41:02,069
Focus on the feeling of your breath.

721
00:41:03,417 --> 00:41:06,920
and allow thoughts and feelings to come and go in the background.

722
00:41:12,607 --> 00:41:18,994
Now gently bring your attention back to the touch of your body on your seat and open your

723
00:41:19,114 --> 00:41:19,254
eyes.

724
00:41:33,195 --> 00:41:34,075
I've got a confession.

725
00:41:34,135 --> 00:41:36,836
That's just an excuse for me to kind of chill out

726
00:41:36,876 --> 00:41:37,596
for a little bit.

727
00:41:39,297 --> 00:41:42,398
No, mindfulness is really, really, really important

728
00:41:43,018 --> 00:41:45,939
as a skill, because if you're able to kind of take

729
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:49,160
that step back, ground yourself, practice that deep breathing,

730
00:41:49,180 --> 00:41:51,341
it actually physiologically.

731
00:41:51,905 --> 00:41:55,707
removes a lot of that pent up stress and energy that's going on and it also

732
00:41:56,268 --> 00:42:00,430
helps your mind to reframe a lot of the stuff that's going on

733
00:42:00,750 --> 00:42:04,253
taking a break from those ruminations and kind of helping yourself to re-ground

734
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:05,033
and re-center

735
00:42:08,055 --> 00:42:13,959
mine oh it did work oh well so we'll move on to

736
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,861
act the third part of our model

737
00:42:17,690 --> 00:42:22,813
We had a think about what's going on around us, what's going on inside and outside,

738
00:42:23,354 --> 00:42:28,497
and now we're going to take the opportunity to learn some evidence-based and effective techniques

739
00:42:28,557 --> 00:42:35,421
that are taken from existing validated psychological therapies to do what you can.

740
00:42:36,123 --> 00:42:37,944
about what you found within there.

741
00:42:39,084 --> 00:42:41,185
And that's what I want to emphasize.

742
00:42:41,765 --> 00:42:42,765
Do what you can.

743
00:42:43,665 --> 00:42:46,066
You know, you're not going to learn everything straight away.

744
00:42:46,106 --> 00:42:47,866
You're not going to be a master at CBT

745
00:42:47,926 --> 00:42:49,426
after one 60-minute lecture.

746
00:42:49,747 --> 00:42:51,667
You're not going to be able to control what's around you,

747
00:42:51,687 --> 00:42:52,727
but you can do what you can.

748
00:42:52,747 --> 00:42:54,408
And that's okay.

749
00:42:54,468 --> 00:42:56,508
That's great, because you did what you could.

750
00:42:59,169 --> 00:43:03,910
Again, we're going to look externally and then internally.

751
00:43:04,562 --> 00:43:07,544
discuss how you can engage your studio and a few,

752
00:43:07,564 --> 00:43:09,424
I call them thought hacks,

753
00:43:09,965 --> 00:43:12,526
to get you to maybe think of the world

754
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:13,806
a little bit differently.

755
00:43:14,167 --> 00:43:15,387
And I'm seeing everybody yawn.

756
00:43:15,407 --> 00:43:17,168
Maybe I should put the mindfulness at the end.

757
00:43:17,188 --> 00:43:17,228
So.

758
00:43:20,242 --> 00:43:26,766
I'd like to talk about if you have the ability, or if you are someone who could talk to the

759
00:43:26,786 --> 00:43:30,267
person who has the ability, how one would engage their studio.

760
00:43:31,168 --> 00:43:37,371
Engagement is defined as the employee's emotional commitment to the organization and its goals.

761
00:43:37,431 --> 00:43:43,234
Not only does it make people feel great and want to work really hard, it also, we have

762
00:43:43,314 --> 00:43:46,936
studies that show it increases profit and output for the company.

763
00:43:47,596 --> 00:43:49,837
It's essentially the opposite of crunch.

764
00:43:50,935 --> 00:43:54,099
And it's not just wrapping your team up in cotton wool

765
00:43:54,860 --> 00:43:55,560
or mollycoddling.

766
00:43:55,580 --> 00:43:58,504
This is real steps that can be taken

767
00:43:58,584 --> 00:44:01,267
to increase team cohesion and productivity.

768
00:44:02,729 --> 00:44:04,031
So here are my suggestions

769
00:44:04,071 --> 00:44:06,374
for how to create an engaging studio.

770
00:44:07,155 --> 00:44:09,698
Have a curfew and stick to it.

771
00:44:10,415 --> 00:44:12,496
If you're the person that sets that curfew,

772
00:44:12,897 --> 00:44:14,538
make sure you go home at that time

773
00:44:14,578 --> 00:44:15,999
and don't let anyone else hang around.

774
00:44:16,039 --> 00:44:17,781
If they wanna go home and they wanna work at home,

775
00:44:18,341 --> 00:44:19,302
you can't control that.

776
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:22,004
But if you can, your studio should have a curfew.

777
00:44:23,165 --> 00:44:24,846
Encourage autonomy, let people go off

778
00:44:24,887 --> 00:44:26,108
and do their own pursuits.

779
00:44:26,248 --> 00:44:28,389
If they're interested in something, that's great.

780
00:44:28,910 --> 00:44:34,234
Let them explore that and give them feedback.

781
00:44:34,554 --> 00:44:36,276
Let them explain to you what they're exploring.

782
00:44:36,316 --> 00:44:37,857
If someone feels like they're able to,

783
00:44:39,048 --> 00:44:43,351
have their own interest and that they're valued by the company, they're more likely to include

784
00:44:43,371 --> 00:44:46,052
that inspiration in their own work.

785
00:44:46,433 --> 00:44:47,473
Manage your resources.

786
00:44:47,493 --> 00:44:53,617
I heard a tip from an anonymous developer once that however long you think something

787
00:44:53,637 --> 00:44:55,358
will take, it will take twice as long.

788
00:44:56,079 --> 00:45:01,102
So as you know, make sure that you've got or you're giving your team enough.

789
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:04,564
And ensure that the team remains the same as much as you can.

790
00:45:05,224 --> 00:45:06,945
If that means that you need to kind of...

791
00:45:07,495 --> 00:45:13,720
validate them more if you need to give them a greater incentive. A team's productivity

792
00:45:14,361 --> 00:45:19,024
improves if they're the same people. If there's a big employee turnover, as happens with crunch

793
00:45:19,065 --> 00:45:20,646
and burnout, you remove that.

794
00:45:21,847 --> 00:45:28,032
Check in. Now, if you don't take away anything from this talk, please listen to this next

795
00:45:28,332 --> 00:45:35,137
35 seconds and take this. Are you okay? No. Are you okay?

796
00:45:36,815 --> 00:45:37,635
Ask it twice.

797
00:45:39,076 --> 00:45:42,679
Whenever I see a patient or a friend or my family or anyone

798
00:45:42,759 --> 00:45:43,960
and I say, hey, you OK?

799
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:45,301
Everybody just goes, yep.

800
00:45:46,221 --> 00:45:47,763
And it's just automatic.

801
00:45:47,803 --> 00:45:48,683
It just rolls out.

802
00:45:48,803 --> 00:45:50,044
It doesn't mean anything.

803
00:45:50,064 --> 00:45:51,965
It doesn't mean they're OK.

804
00:45:53,366 --> 00:45:54,407
So you say, cool.

805
00:45:55,628 --> 00:45:56,409
Yeah, but are you?

806
00:45:57,129 --> 00:45:57,650
Are you OK?

807
00:45:58,895 --> 00:46:02,118
The second time, I guarantee, go out of this room,

808
00:46:02,158 --> 00:46:03,839
like, after this, ask anyone.

809
00:46:04,260 --> 00:46:06,382
The second time, the answer will be different.

810
00:46:07,203 --> 00:46:07,823
It might be.

811
00:46:09,097 --> 00:46:12,039
Oh, you know what? Yeah, I am okay. I hadn't really thought about it, but yeah, I am.

812
00:46:12,079 --> 00:46:13,660
Or it might be no, I'm not good.

813
00:46:14,241 --> 00:46:17,083
This is like such a long convention.

814
00:46:17,904 --> 00:46:20,406
Ask twice. It makes such a difference.

815
00:46:20,846 --> 00:46:23,628
And people feel heard and validated and listened to.

816
00:46:24,069 --> 00:46:25,630
And you feel like a great person.

817
00:46:25,790 --> 00:46:27,912
And it's just, it's a really good tip.

818
00:46:28,032 --> 00:46:30,694
So that's my one take-home message.

819
00:46:32,708 --> 00:46:36,411
Have an open door policy where you ask people if they're okay twice.

820
00:46:37,672 --> 00:46:41,234
If someone comes in and they say, you know, I really want to chat about something,

821
00:46:42,816 --> 00:46:44,437
you might not have the time for them.

822
00:46:44,817 --> 00:46:47,519
But if I would recommend one thing, it would be never to say no,

823
00:46:47,780 --> 00:46:50,301
always to say yes, definitely.

824
00:46:51,042 --> 00:46:53,524
Not right now, because I've got this other thing,

825
00:46:53,584 --> 00:46:55,766
but I will make time for you at this allotted slot,

826
00:46:56,066 --> 00:46:57,207
and then try and stick to it.

827
00:46:57,607 --> 00:47:00,089
They feel validated. They know that you're busy anyway.

828
00:47:00,469 --> 00:47:02,591
but then they know that they're cared about.

829
00:47:04,152 --> 00:47:07,234
Have a mental health procedure and develop a referral system.

830
00:47:07,834 --> 00:47:11,417
This is a really odd thing, but I don't know about you guys,

831
00:47:11,697 --> 00:47:14,659
whenever I move to a new hospital, and this happens every six months,

832
00:47:15,359 --> 00:47:19,662
I have to learn how to pick up heavy stuff and operate a fire extinguisher.

833
00:47:20,583 --> 00:47:23,045
Every time. I never remember.

834
00:47:23,465 --> 00:47:25,066
If there was a fire, we'd all be screwed.

835
00:47:26,253 --> 00:47:27,574
But I have to learn it.

836
00:47:27,954 --> 00:47:30,355
Why do these procedures not exist for mental health?

837
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,336
Have a mental health policy, keep people safe.

838
00:47:34,156 --> 00:47:36,497
And if you don't know how to develop one,

839
00:47:37,457 --> 00:47:39,398
there's a charity that can help you with that.

840
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:41,539
Hit us up, we can help.

841
00:47:44,300 --> 00:47:46,261
Now let's move on to something a bit trickier.

842
00:47:46,881 --> 00:47:48,662
I mean, you might think that engaging your studio

843
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:49,762
is the hardest thing in the world,

844
00:47:49,802 --> 00:47:53,943
but psychological differences are pretty tough to make.

845
00:47:56,443 --> 00:48:02,048
Thought challenging comes from a branch of psychological therapy called CBT, which is

846
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:07,433
cognitive behavioural therapy. It's highly effective and it can be self-taught as well

847
00:48:07,473 --> 00:48:11,157
as led by a therapist. It's not for everyone.

848
00:48:12,774 --> 00:48:15,576
It's very good if you're the sort of person who ruminates,

849
00:48:16,316 --> 00:48:20,079
or if you have a kind of mild depression or mild anxiety.

850
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,082
It's not so great for people who obsess,

851
00:48:24,462 --> 00:48:26,784
so people who have like obsessive compulsive traits,

852
00:48:27,465 --> 00:48:29,746
and people who are, we call them alexithymic,

853
00:48:29,786 --> 00:48:32,649
who struggle to be able to describe their feelings.

854
00:48:33,749 --> 00:48:36,992
So if you see something in this that kind of speaks to you,

855
00:48:37,052 --> 00:48:38,013
go and have a read about it.

856
00:48:40,523 --> 00:48:45,887
The key concept in thought challenging is this really weird idea that your thoughts

857
00:48:46,067 --> 00:48:47,368
might not be true.

858
00:48:48,349 --> 00:48:54,433
And that's a really odd thing to think because the way that we've led ourselves through the

859
00:48:54,493 --> 00:48:59,056
world throughout our entire life, everything we perceive and everything that we know to

860
00:48:59,076 --> 00:49:00,617
be true is led by our thoughts.

861
00:49:01,295 --> 00:49:03,177
So if I just sit around and tell you,

862
00:49:03,217 --> 00:49:06,159
hey, no, they're not true, they're lying.

863
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:07,781
You'd be like, uh, sorry?

864
00:49:07,801 --> 00:49:10,403
Like, how am I supposed to perceive the world

865
00:49:10,443 --> 00:49:12,004
if I don't know what's real and what's not?

866
00:49:14,426 --> 00:49:17,028
But your thoughts aren't always true.

867
00:49:17,068 --> 00:49:18,569
In fact, we have a word for it.

868
00:49:18,589 --> 00:49:19,550
We call them ants.

869
00:49:20,211 --> 00:49:22,172
They're automatic negative thoughts.

870
00:49:22,633 --> 00:49:24,454
And it's that little voice in your head that goes,

871
00:49:24,474 --> 00:49:25,255
you're not good enough.

872
00:49:26,396 --> 00:49:28,538
You are not gonna do this on time.

873
00:49:29,567 --> 00:49:31,629
Or, you know, you're worthless.

874
00:49:31,809 --> 00:49:34,231
It's that lie that you tell yourself

875
00:49:34,711 --> 00:49:36,452
that you don't even consider to be a lie

876
00:49:36,472 --> 00:49:37,653
because it was a thought that you had,

877
00:49:37,713 --> 00:49:38,834
so it must be true, right?

878
00:49:40,335 --> 00:49:41,516
It leads to a feeling,

879
00:49:43,817 --> 00:49:45,959
usually a very distressing one,

880
00:49:46,439 --> 00:49:47,860
which might lead to a behavior.

881
00:49:48,479 --> 00:49:50,542
that's misplaced and inappropriate.

882
00:49:51,063 --> 00:49:52,965
So I've got an example here.

883
00:49:53,005 --> 00:49:55,629
You might see two people in the corridor talking about you

884
00:49:55,689 --> 00:49:57,491
and you get an automatic negative thought.

885
00:49:57,932 --> 00:49:59,334
They're talking about me and it's mean.

886
00:50:00,295 --> 00:50:01,637
That makes you feel really unwanted.

887
00:50:02,593 --> 00:50:04,134
and sad and rejected.

888
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:06,476
And then you might avoid those colleagues,

889
00:50:06,877 --> 00:50:09,159
or you might drink alcohol,

890
00:50:09,199 --> 00:50:10,981
you might even be rude to them,

891
00:50:11,121 --> 00:50:12,802
and then lose a potential friendship,

892
00:50:13,303 --> 00:50:15,044
like potential professional relationship

893
00:50:15,064 --> 00:50:16,666
because you had this thought that wasn't true.

894
00:50:16,686 --> 00:50:18,067
And you didn't even know it,

895
00:50:18,087 --> 00:50:19,468
you thought you were protecting yourself.

896
00:50:23,036 --> 00:50:27,757
The beauty of this is that because it's a cycle,

897
00:50:28,377 --> 00:50:31,198
it means there's actually different points of intervention,

898
00:50:31,478 --> 00:50:33,099
which means we can stop this process.

899
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:36,380
And one of the ways we do that is thought challenging.

900
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:40,121
Otherwise, the cycle becomes kind of,

901
00:50:40,781 --> 00:50:42,961
it's a vicious cycle that's self-reinforcing.

902
00:50:44,942 --> 00:50:48,363
So I've got a couple examples of how you might do this.

903
00:50:49,704 --> 00:50:51,244
and it's a three-step process.

904
00:50:51,464 --> 00:50:54,526
One, you recognize the unhelpful thought for what it is.

905
00:50:55,066 --> 00:50:57,068
And a good way to do this is to keep a thought diary.

906
00:50:57,108 --> 00:50:59,009
If you have a situation that didn't go the way

907
00:50:59,029 --> 00:51:00,449
that you wanted it or you felt rough,

908
00:51:01,010 --> 00:51:03,331
what was I thinking just before that happened?

909
00:51:03,991 --> 00:51:05,472
And then how did it make me feel?

910
00:51:07,633 --> 00:51:10,555
Once you've considered what the unhelpful thought was

911
00:51:10,655 --> 00:51:12,016
and the feeling that came of it,

912
00:51:12,496 --> 00:51:14,137
you just replace that thought.

913
00:51:14,297 --> 00:51:15,678
You go, no, I'm not gonna have that one

914
00:51:15,698 --> 00:51:16,918
because it wasn't true.

915
00:51:16,938 --> 00:51:18,079
I'm gonna have this better one.

916
00:51:18,639 --> 00:51:19,340
For example.

917
00:51:20,114 --> 00:51:21,455
It's all about balancing.

918
00:51:22,356 --> 00:51:24,558
No one likes me, you feel lonely being in that world.

919
00:51:24,959 --> 00:51:26,280
Yes, some people don't like me.

920
00:51:27,361 --> 00:51:29,704
No one likes everybody, that's just a fact.

921
00:51:30,365 --> 00:51:33,828
But other people like me, and that's really cool.

922
00:51:33,848 --> 00:51:34,869
I've got some great friends.

923
00:51:35,550 --> 00:51:36,671
It's all about that balance.

924
00:51:37,412 --> 00:51:39,693
And ants kind of, I call them having flavors.

925
00:51:40,874 --> 00:51:42,975
There are different flavors of ants.

926
00:51:44,396 --> 00:51:47,777
And not that I eat ants, I never really considered that.

927
00:51:49,318 --> 00:51:50,359
There's flavors of ants.

928
00:51:50,699 --> 00:51:52,600
They can be catastrophizing.

929
00:51:52,900 --> 00:51:55,321
So a catastrophizing one is the worst possible outcome

930
00:51:55,561 --> 00:51:56,382
is going to happen here.

931
00:51:56,642 --> 00:51:58,623
So just before we came in, I was like, Josh,

932
00:51:58,643 --> 00:51:59,683
what if no one turns up?

933
00:52:00,343 --> 00:52:02,765
He's like, at least one person will turn up.

934
00:52:02,805 --> 00:52:04,405
And if no one turns up, we don't have to do it.

935
00:52:05,626 --> 00:52:05,766
OK.

936
00:52:07,505 --> 00:52:08,285
I'm alright with that.

937
00:52:10,187 --> 00:52:12,008
Some ants are mind-reading.

938
00:52:12,428 --> 00:52:16,211
So I might think that I see someone and like that previous example,

939
00:52:16,271 --> 00:52:19,474
I know that they're talking about me, or I know what they're thinking.

940
00:52:21,055 --> 00:52:24,377
He must think that I'm not very good, for example.

941
00:52:25,438 --> 00:52:30,022
Some ants predict the future, which is similar to catastrophizing.

942
00:52:30,649 --> 00:52:33,971
Some ants, they personalize, they make something about them.

943
00:52:34,491 --> 00:52:37,133
So you might see, again, two people interacting,

944
00:52:37,153 --> 00:52:38,494
you assume it's something to do with you,

945
00:52:38,534 --> 00:52:41,255
but it might not be, or it might be something good to do with you.

946
00:52:41,275 --> 00:52:46,979
And a really powerful one is that the should, must, can't, always, never statements,

947
00:52:47,039 --> 00:52:48,640
these kind of very black and white,

948
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:51,062
it's either one or the other and there's no in between.

949
00:52:52,009 --> 00:52:55,450
This is one of the easiest points of intervention, actually, because if you think,

950
00:52:55,810 --> 00:53:01,472
oh, this always happens, or that is never going to occur, or I must do this,

951
00:53:01,852 --> 00:53:05,213
then you just change that one word and you've done this.

952
00:53:05,754 --> 00:53:10,715
You go, oh, I can, that would be good, or it would be ideal if that did happen.

953
00:53:11,015 --> 00:53:14,536
You just change that one word and you've just done some thought challenging.

954
00:53:16,657 --> 00:53:20,678
The next technique is called thought diffusion, and this comes from

955
00:53:21,559 --> 00:53:28,044
Act acceptance commitment therapy. This is the one that Josh did and it's based on the idea that

956
00:53:30,025 --> 00:53:36,171
our thoughts are linked in an intrinsic way. So I've given you the idea here.

957
00:53:36,751 --> 00:53:41,675
Don't think of an elephant because of course you will and not just thinking of an elephant.

958
00:53:41,695 --> 00:53:42,396
You'll probably think of

959
00:53:43,307 --> 00:53:46,650
what it looks like, it's got big ears, it's got the tusks and stuff.

960
00:53:47,050 --> 00:53:50,313
You might think of Dumbo, you might think of the noise that it makes,

961
00:53:50,993 --> 00:53:52,134
the trumpet thing.

962
00:53:53,335 --> 00:53:55,897
All of these ideas are linked together in your head.

963
00:53:56,738 --> 00:53:59,520
And that's a very, obviously, simplistic example, but

964
00:54:00,500 --> 00:54:03,022
if you extrapolate that, it means that

965
00:54:03,583 --> 00:54:07,366
thoughts, like the ones we were having before, could be linked in your head

966
00:54:07,886 --> 00:54:11,409
and that could cause things to happen that you didn't really want to happen, of course.

967
00:54:12,322 --> 00:54:16,705
So what we look at in thought defusion,

968
00:54:17,105 --> 00:54:18,447
get it, because there's cognitive fusion,

969
00:54:18,487 --> 00:54:20,428
they're fused together and now it's defused,

970
00:54:20,488 --> 00:54:21,889
they invented a word for it.

971
00:54:23,611 --> 00:54:25,412
Not all thoughts are workable.

972
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:29,956
And if you could just learn to let it go,

973
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:31,977
then you can just move on.

974
00:54:32,318 --> 00:54:35,440
So it's not as practical intervention-based as CBT.

975
00:54:36,373 --> 00:54:38,114
but you can just let it go.

976
00:54:38,275 --> 00:54:39,716
And there's like a hundred techniques.

977
00:54:39,756 --> 00:54:42,338
You could sing the thought in the tune of happy birthday.

978
00:54:42,919 --> 00:54:44,620
You could repeat it over and over again

979
00:54:44,660 --> 00:54:45,701
until it makes no sense.

980
00:54:45,721 --> 00:54:46,502
You know when you do that,

981
00:54:46,522 --> 00:54:48,444
when it's like milk, milk, milk, milk, milk.

982
00:54:49,104 --> 00:54:50,345
You can do that with phrases.

983
00:54:51,286 --> 00:54:54,509
You can visualize it going into a cloud

984
00:54:54,549 --> 00:54:56,150
and floating off into the distance.

985
00:54:56,751 --> 00:54:58,492
These are just some of the ways

986
00:54:58,512 --> 00:54:59,994
that you can use this technique

987
00:55:00,314 --> 00:55:01,475
to get rid of those thoughts,

988
00:55:01,535 --> 00:55:02,636
the feelings that they give you,

989
00:55:02,676 --> 00:55:03,717
and just get on with the day.

990
00:55:05,834 --> 00:55:10,078
And the last one I have, and I'm going to rush through it because I've only got five minutes, sorry guys,

991
00:55:10,939 --> 00:55:14,362
is we talked a bit about adaptive and maladaptive coping mechanisms.

992
00:55:14,843 --> 00:55:16,784
Here are some positive ones.

993
00:55:17,445 --> 00:55:21,349
Anything can be used too much, but this is kind of like a bunch that we can take.

994
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,595
Positive reinterpretation is a bit like CBT, and again I saw a really good TED talk by Carol Dweck

995
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:29,497
where she mentioned the power of yet.

996
00:55:30,697 --> 00:55:34,200
where there were these students and as a test result,

997
00:55:34,340 --> 00:55:37,242
instead of it saying fail, it said not yet.

998
00:55:39,364 --> 00:55:42,067
It completely reappraises that entire situation

999
00:55:42,407 --> 00:55:45,490
and gives them a longevity to that experience.

1000
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:47,271
It's not just yes or no, it's not yet.

1001
00:55:48,913 --> 00:55:51,275
Again, using humor, every cloud has a silver lining,

1002
00:55:51,295 --> 00:55:52,115
they're similar things.

1003
00:55:52,836 --> 00:55:54,878
Relaxation, I just taught you how to do that.

1004
00:55:56,539 --> 00:56:02,323
Social support is really interesting because one of the things I didn't tell you about stress earlier is it releases oxytocin

1005
00:56:02,883 --> 00:56:05,825
oxytocin is the hugging hormone and

1006
00:56:05,986 --> 00:56:11,189
It means that when you get stressed you want to hug people when you hug people you get more oxytocin and oxytocin

1007
00:56:11,870 --> 00:56:16,493
Mends the damage that stress caused so hugging people

1008
00:56:17,454 --> 00:56:18,115
fixes

1009
00:56:19,015 --> 00:56:20,777
the damaged vessels the strained heart

1010
00:56:21,467 --> 00:56:23,988
Hugging men's broken hearts, essentially.

1011
00:56:24,588 --> 00:56:25,929
It's a real biological thing.

1012
00:56:26,329 --> 00:56:28,229
And that's why we seek support with, you know,

1013
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:30,410
we're very social creatures

1014
00:56:30,450 --> 00:56:31,830
and it's built into our evolution.

1015
00:56:32,891 --> 00:56:34,891
Restraint, I gave you an example earlier

1016
00:56:34,951 --> 00:56:37,612
about like my bills that I get from the UK.

1017
00:56:37,732 --> 00:56:39,913
I've now had to learn that I need to wait 12 hours

1018
00:56:39,973 --> 00:56:41,813
before I call them, otherwise they'll be very mad.

1019
00:56:42,513 --> 00:56:45,814
So I've learned techniques to put aside

1020
00:56:46,455 --> 00:56:48,895
what I need to do now or what I think I need to do now

1021
00:56:49,055 --> 00:56:51,036
and do it later so I don't make things worse.

1022
00:56:52,210 --> 00:56:54,671
And problem solving can include planning,

1023
00:56:54,771 --> 00:56:56,652
and it can be proactive or retrospective.

1024
00:56:57,473 --> 00:57:00,074
And it also includes suppression of competing activities.

1025
00:57:00,114 --> 00:57:01,675
And what this means is if you've got something

1026
00:57:01,695 --> 00:57:02,755
that you're supposed to be doing,

1027
00:57:02,775 --> 00:57:06,037
and there's something else that's slightly less important,

1028
00:57:07,077 --> 00:57:07,817
do that one later.

1029
00:57:10,699 --> 00:57:12,339
So that's my three-step model.

1030
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:16,321
We audited, we accepted, and then we learned how to act.

1031
00:57:16,901 --> 00:57:18,482
And I hope that you can take that away

1032
00:57:18,742 --> 00:57:20,003
and find some benefit in it.

1033
00:57:21,312 --> 00:57:26,096
If you've been affected by anything that we've talked about today, here are the emergency

1034
00:57:26,156 --> 00:57:29,880
numbers for everywhere I could think of.

1035
00:57:31,221 --> 00:57:36,865
Obviously, my geography is not as good as it could be, but there's a few there.

1036
00:57:38,167 --> 00:57:44,372
And here is a very not exhaustive list of some of the wonderful mental health organizations

1037
00:57:44,412 --> 00:57:47,775
that are out there, a few of which are partners with Checkpoint.

1038
00:57:50,610 --> 00:57:55,678
We don't have time for questions but we'll be in the wrap-up area.

1039
00:57:56,159 --> 00:57:59,084
Please complete the survey. I'd really love to come back and do this again.

1040
00:57:59,124 --> 00:58:00,286
That would be really awesome.

1041
00:58:01,688 --> 00:58:02,209
Yeah, of course.

1042
00:58:05,575 --> 00:58:07,616
Yeah, so it would be really great to do the survey.

1043
00:58:07,636 --> 00:58:09,258
I have business cards here.

1044
00:58:09,278 --> 00:58:12,740
Come and take all of them, please, if you'd be interested.

1045
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:18,685
We're running a Kickstarter later this year, so if you would be interested in helping us

1046
00:58:18,945 --> 00:58:24,029
out at all by sharing and spreading the word, it would be so appreciative because we're

1047
00:58:24,049 --> 00:58:25,851
non-profit, so everything helps.

1048
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:28,673
Thank you so much for coming.

1049
00:58:28,693 --> 00:58:29,774
You guys are wonderful.

1050
00:58:29,794 --> 00:58:31,495
Thank you.

1051
00:58:31,575 --> 00:58:31,776
Thank you.

1052
00:58:31,816 --> 00:58:32,056
Thank you.
