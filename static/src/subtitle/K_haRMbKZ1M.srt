1
00:00:05,013 --> 00:00:08,193
All right, everyone. Let's get started. Thank you so much for

2
00:00:08,213 --> 00:00:11,994
coming. This is the sound of hyperlite drifter. My name is

3
00:00:12,034 --> 00:00:14,674
Akash Thakkar. So before we get started, before we do anything,

4
00:00:14,694 --> 00:00:17,255
I'm just going to play a trailer from the game for you for any of

5
00:00:17,295 --> 00:00:19,415
you who aren't familiar with the game, and then we'll move on.

6
00:01:25,618 --> 00:01:27,823
All right. So I'm coming to you. Thank you.

7
00:01:32,553 --> 00:01:34,798
We only have 25 minutes. No clapping. We got to keep this.

8
00:01:36,659 --> 00:01:44,121
I'm coming to you today with a simple message and that is that the purpose of sound design is emotional impact.

9
00:01:44,741 --> 00:01:47,502
Nothing else. That's the purpose of audio in all of your guys' games.

10
00:01:47,902 --> 00:01:53,704
So it doesn't mean that you need to make your players cry every single time they match three in Bejeweled.

11
00:01:53,744 --> 00:01:54,765
That's not what I mean.

12
00:01:55,265 --> 00:02:00,626
But what I do mean is that you need to get some sort of reaction out of every bit of audio, music or sound or voiceover.

13
00:02:01,267 --> 00:02:05,628
Whatever's in there. It can be everything from the footsteps all the way to the sword sounds to the explosions

14
00:02:05,688 --> 00:02:10,229
It could it could say hey player go over there or avoid that area look over here

15
00:02:10,509 --> 00:02:16,511
You should think about this that sort of thing you can tell you can basically force them to pay attention to different

16
00:02:16,991 --> 00:02:21,232
Effects based on this emotional impact and that's how I approached hyper light drifter

17
00:02:21,392 --> 00:02:28,454
Everything from the footsteps to the little voice over lines to the monsters had to elicit some sort of emotional response

18
00:02:28,814 --> 00:02:29,294
from the player

19
00:02:29,914 --> 00:02:34,098
So, before we go on, just a little bit about me. I'm a composer and sound designer for video games,

20
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:39,524
did Hyper Light Drifter, did some music work on Destiny recently, gave a TEDx talk on the power

21
00:02:39,544 --> 00:02:43,648
of video game music, and I'm a professor of game audio at the Seattle Film Institute,

22
00:02:43,848 --> 00:02:47,432
where I'm based, and also do a lot of virtual reality stuff now.

23
00:02:47,892 --> 00:02:53,156
So what we're covering in this talk is the sound design process, so how it was made,

24
00:02:53,196 --> 00:02:57,039
just a little tidbits on that, how I worked remotely with the Heart Machine team,

25
00:02:57,179 --> 00:02:59,621
I'm based in Seattle, everyone else was in Los Angeles,

26
00:03:00,201 --> 00:03:04,465
and for those of you who aren't audio designers, tips for working with audio professionals,

27
00:03:04,505 --> 00:03:09,208
because we have the most weird, intangible part of the whole game development spectrum.

28
00:03:10,104 --> 00:03:13,967
So the Heart Machine team, the people who made Hyper Light Drifter, was around 10 people.

29
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:17,590
And I say around because we had contractors come in and out throughout the whole project.

30
00:03:18,190 --> 00:03:20,412
Mostly based, again, in Los Angeles, California.

31
00:03:20,772 --> 00:03:23,455
And I worked for my home office in Seattle, Washington.

32
00:03:23,495 --> 00:03:26,477
So all along the West Coast, but we were definitely a remote team.

33
00:03:26,957 --> 00:03:31,301
And the audio team consisted of myself and the composer who was a disaster piece for this game.

34
00:03:31,761 --> 00:03:33,323
He also was working remotely.

35
00:03:33,423 --> 00:03:35,845
He worked in his studio in Berkeley, California.

36
00:03:36,205 --> 00:03:40,330
So we all had a bit of a remote environment, especially for audio.

37
00:03:41,130 --> 00:03:45,795
So the workflow between all this remote stuff that was going on was Slack, of course, which

38
00:03:45,835 --> 00:03:46,536
is the best thing ever.

39
00:03:46,936 --> 00:03:47,897
Slack was our best friend.

40
00:03:48,217 --> 00:03:50,660
Asana and Workflowy were used for assigning tasks.

41
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,361
A lot of you probably know what Asana is.

42
00:03:52,702 --> 00:03:53,943
Workflowy is a little less known.

43
00:03:54,003 --> 00:03:55,685
If you don't know about Workflowy, it's the best thing ever.

44
00:03:56,145 --> 00:03:59,970
It's just a whole bunch of bullet-pointed lists and that's it.

45
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:01,071
It's amazing.

46
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:05,736
But I actually, thanks to Workflowy and its simple UI, now I use it every single day to

47
00:04:05,776 --> 00:04:07,118
manage my own personal life.

48
00:04:07,759 --> 00:04:08,960
It's phenomenal.

49
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,743
And it allows you to share tasks with other people and have different lists.

50
00:04:12,264 --> 00:04:13,564
It's so good. It's so good.

51
00:04:13,984 --> 00:04:17,106
Now, one of the most important things with remote, working remotely,

52
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:20,668
is having weekly check-ins with the creative director.

53
00:04:20,768 --> 00:04:23,869
So, Alex Preston was the creative director on Hyper Light Drifter.

54
00:04:24,409 --> 00:04:27,551
And, really important thing to do was to have every Tuesday,

55
00:04:27,591 --> 00:04:30,192
we blocked off at least an hour and had weekly check-ins.

56
00:04:30,352 --> 00:04:33,073
Even if neither of us had updates for one another,

57
00:04:33,433 --> 00:04:35,434
we still made sure to have a habit of saying,

58
00:04:35,635 --> 00:04:38,236
Hey, what's up? Nothing. Okay, great. Talk to you next week.

59
00:04:38,876 --> 00:04:43,138
every single week because one, a lot of you who are remote workers know that a lot of

60
00:04:43,178 --> 00:04:45,138
studios will forget about you like that.

61
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:48,120
It's super easy to just be forgotten about if you're not in studio.

62
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:53,102
So this made it so that one, I wasn't forgotten about and two, if any major updates were being

63
00:04:53,162 --> 00:04:56,183
planned, I was in on it very quickly and very easily.

64
00:04:56,203 --> 00:04:59,924
If they're planning on removing or adding an entirely new feature, if they were planning

65
00:04:59,964 --> 00:05:04,186
on adding a new monster, whatever it may be, I was in the loop and I could let Alex know,

66
00:05:04,306 --> 00:05:05,947
okay, here's the audio planes that I have.

67
00:05:06,247 --> 00:05:06,847
And he might say like.

68
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,429
Oh no, don't do that, that feature's not in anymore.

69
00:05:09,769 --> 00:05:12,250
It's thanks to those weekly check-ins, so I didn't waste a whole bunch of time.

70
00:05:12,771 --> 00:05:17,433
Now, a lot of people ask me if Disasterpeace and I, like, interfaced about the music and sound for this game,

71
00:05:17,453 --> 00:05:18,094
and honestly, no.

72
00:05:18,114 --> 00:05:22,156
Uh, Disasterpeace and I have known each other for about six or seven years now,

73
00:05:22,236 --> 00:05:24,678
so we went to school together, so I think we just gelled.

74
00:05:24,698 --> 00:05:28,560
I'm not saying that your composers and sound designers shouldn't talk to each other,

75
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:31,222
that's the opposite of what they should be doing,

76
00:05:31,282 --> 00:05:34,303
but in this situation, over the course of the three-year development,

77
00:05:34,844 --> 00:05:39,588
He and I talked maybe three times of just, hey, can you avoid the bass frequencies here?

78
00:05:39,689 --> 00:05:41,310
I'm going to do some high frequency stuff here.

79
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:43,092
Can you add bird chanting to my track?

80
00:05:43,172 --> 00:05:44,773
Yes, that was a conversation that happened.

81
00:05:45,614 --> 00:05:50,599
That's the only stuff that we covered because our styles gel anyway, and we happened to

82
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:52,040
know each other before the project.

83
00:05:52,894 --> 00:05:57,717
So, the whole design process of this was that sound design is all about experimentation,

84
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:00,959
the artists in the room know exactly what I'm talking about, the programmers in the

85
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:04,921
room know exactly what I'm talking about, game development is nothing more than a whole

86
00:06:04,961 --> 00:06:07,783
bunch of people failing upwards until something happens.

87
00:06:08,524 --> 00:06:12,988
That's all it is. So it's a miracle games get made at all and sound design is probably the most

88
00:06:13,088 --> 00:06:17,812
experimenty of all of that. So many of the sounds didn't make it into the game at all. I think

89
00:06:18,013 --> 00:06:24,979
total I designed about 560 and only about 300 some went into the game. But that's totally normal.

90
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,464
That's part of this process because as the game develops, as other people fail,

91
00:06:29,904 --> 00:06:35,868
You're going to do it too, and you're going to fail together upwards until you get that final vision realized.

92
00:06:35,888 --> 00:06:37,109
And that's what happened with this game.

93
00:06:37,649 --> 00:06:41,331
Now, in terms of process, what I did was layer a whole bunch of sounds together.

94
00:06:41,351 --> 00:06:43,293
I'm going to show you a video of what that means in a second.

95
00:06:43,793 --> 00:06:49,196
But every single sound you hear in that game, and most games in general that have decent sound,

96
00:06:49,517 --> 00:06:55,040
the sound designer is layering or putting a whole bunch of sounds on top of each other to create one unique thing.

97
00:06:55,540 --> 00:07:00,182
So this video I'm about to show you is in Logic Pro, the sound design tool that I used

98
00:07:00,222 --> 00:07:00,862
for this project.

99
00:07:00,882 --> 00:07:03,082
I've since moved on, but I use Logic Pro for this one.

100
00:07:03,843 --> 00:07:06,803
And what you can see here is one sword sound effect.

101
00:07:07,144 --> 00:07:09,484
And it's made up of 15 different other sounds that all come together to make just one sword

102
00:07:09,504 --> 00:07:09,664
sound.

103
00:07:09,684 --> 00:07:10,064
And that's it.

104
00:07:10,084 --> 00:07:10,725
It's a very short video.

105
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:11,245
I hope you enjoyed it.

106
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,425
And if you did, please give this video a like.

107
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:13,545
And I will see you in the next video.

108
00:07:13,565 --> 00:07:13,645
Bye!

109
00:07:13,765 --> 00:07:16,789
In total, I made crazy, crazy, crazy amounts of sound,

110
00:07:17,109 --> 00:07:19,753
combined them together, and it made something unique in the end.

111
00:07:20,213 --> 00:07:23,497
Now, what this video is, is me walking you through every single layer

112
00:07:24,058 --> 00:07:25,439
and playing them all one by one,

113
00:07:25,539 --> 00:07:27,221
and then you'll hear them all together in the end.

114
00:07:52,242 --> 00:07:52,863
Now all together...

115
00:07:55,953 --> 00:08:01,136
So it takes a lot of time and effort to make just one single sword sound effect, but that's

116
00:08:01,156 --> 00:08:03,057
how every single sound in this game was made.

117
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:06,579
Not all of them were 15 layers, some of them were just three or four, but not one of them

118
00:08:06,619 --> 00:08:07,539
was just one sound.

119
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:12,242
Every single thing was just crammed together and sometimes I was just like, let's see what

120
00:08:12,282 --> 00:08:14,904
happens if I put a tiger growl in here, who's to say?

121
00:08:15,284 --> 00:08:17,025
And it's a miracle people pay us for this.

122
00:08:17,485 --> 00:08:17,585
So...

123
00:08:19,437 --> 00:08:22,998
So to get those sounds that I just showed you, I had some special gear.

124
00:08:23,559 --> 00:08:27,801
So one thing that I used was a wire recorder, which I'm going to show you from the 1950s,

125
00:08:28,421 --> 00:08:31,642
and the other thing was a stethoscope that I turned into a microphone.

126
00:08:31,863 --> 00:08:33,483
Now that nobody's confused, let's move on.

127
00:08:35,257 --> 00:08:38,539
So, the wire recorder. Let's show that first and then I'll talk about the stethoscope.

128
00:08:38,579 --> 00:08:43,742
So, I use this thing, which is a recording device from the 1950s that came out before tape.

129
00:08:44,082 --> 00:08:51,087
It was invented basically right before World War II and phased out right afterwards in 1953, when tape was invented.

130
00:08:51,567 --> 00:08:56,410
So, what it is, is it records onto this thin metal wire that's like fishing wire.

131
00:08:56,430 --> 00:08:59,692
It's super tiny and the instruction manual that came with it is like,

132
00:08:59,752 --> 00:09:02,714
hey, the wire is going to snap for sure. It's totally going to snap.

133
00:09:03,335 --> 00:09:10,278
When it does, just tie the wire back together. Great. Awesome. Sweet. So you can record directly

134
00:09:10,378 --> 00:09:14,960
onto this wire and the cool thing is because it's metal, the sound never degrades. So when

135
00:09:15,001 --> 00:09:19,403
I got this from some happy guy in Florida off of eBay for like 200 bucks, well worth

136
00:09:19,463 --> 00:09:23,185
it, it came with a whole bunch of spools of recordings from people from World War II.

137
00:09:23,625 --> 00:09:26,266
It's father and son talking about their experiences during the war.

138
00:09:26,606 --> 00:09:29,467
Some guy just playing a ripping marimba solo for 20 minutes.

139
00:09:29,967 --> 00:09:32,248
Two little girls learning the piano for the first time.

140
00:09:32,348 --> 00:09:34,409
I have all of these recordings thanks to this thing,

141
00:09:34,429 --> 00:09:37,250
and they're all original, and I digitized it, and it's fantastic.

142
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,551
So to show you a video of this thing in action,

143
00:09:39,571 --> 00:09:45,954
I have like a 15-second video of what sorts of stuff this came with and what it sounds like.

144
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,911
So it's the instant Bioshock Fallout 3 machine.

145
00:10:01,951 --> 00:10:03,231
It's fantastic.

146
00:10:03,391 --> 00:10:04,271
It's so good.

147
00:10:05,332 --> 00:10:05,792
Well worth it.

148
00:10:05,892 --> 00:10:07,352
That was just a snippet.

149
00:10:07,412 --> 00:10:09,753
It came with hours and hours and hours.

150
00:10:09,793 --> 00:10:13,933
I think total I have like 26 hours of stuff like that recorded.

151
00:10:14,333 --> 00:10:15,454
It overheats in ten minutes.

152
00:10:15,714 --> 00:10:17,414
It makes a horrible humming sound after five.

153
00:10:17,434 --> 00:10:19,935
You have to unplug it and re-plug it in because it's probably going to set fire.

154
00:10:20,335 --> 00:10:22,455
Took forever to digitize it all, but well worth it.

155
00:10:23,055 --> 00:10:27,978
So in terms of how I used it in the game, we have an antagonist in Hyper Light Drifter named Hal,

156
00:10:27,998 --> 00:10:30,139
and you're going to see his GIF looping right there.

157
00:10:30,580 --> 00:10:33,001
So he's probably the main antagonist of the game.

158
00:10:33,041 --> 00:10:38,144
He's this awful enemy that's super powerful and can kill you just ridiculously quickly.

159
00:10:38,740 --> 00:10:42,621
So we needed him to sound completely different from all the other monsters.

160
00:10:43,041 --> 00:10:47,442
Now I used the wire recorder for every single monster in the game, and by the way, the angelic

161
00:10:47,502 --> 00:10:50,522
voice you're hearing right now is every single monster in the game.

162
00:10:51,042 --> 00:10:55,523
And I recorded myself squelching and screeching into this wire recorder to get interesting,

163
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:56,184
unique sounds.

164
00:10:56,624 --> 00:11:00,585
This one needed to not sound like a regular growl, not a regular roar, not a regular monster.

165
00:11:00,905 --> 00:11:03,525
We needed something that was spine-tingling and crazy and weird.

166
00:11:03,905 --> 00:11:05,886
So I recorded myself squealing like this awful pig.

167
00:11:06,706 --> 00:11:11,051
So I put that into the wire recorder and then put it into logic and stretched it out and

168
00:11:11,071 --> 00:11:13,334
made it insane and weird and here's the result I got.

169
00:11:18,641 --> 00:11:21,764
So that's again this through the wire recorder.

170
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:23,807
So thanks to that I could get some really crazy sounds.

171
00:11:24,947 --> 00:11:28,189
Now next up is the stethoscope, this beautiful work of art you see right here.

172
00:11:28,649 --> 00:11:33,852
So what I did was take a stethoscope, I cut off the little ear thingies, and what I did

173
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:38,335
then was take that pipe and basically put it through a garden hose spigot.

174
00:11:39,016 --> 00:11:42,738
Tape that together, put the microphone on the other side of that garden hose spigot,

175
00:11:43,038 --> 00:11:49,582
tape it together, and then have a cord, like just a standard XLR cable, going into my portable

176
00:11:49,642 --> 00:11:50,363
recording device.

177
00:11:50,963 --> 00:11:55,264
That way I could record things like blood, the conversations on other sides of windows,

178
00:11:55,464 --> 00:11:57,304
you know, normal everyday stuff, no problem.

179
00:11:57,925 --> 00:12:01,405
So fun fact, I use this for a lot of the ambiences in the game.

180
00:12:01,585 --> 00:12:04,006
So there's one ambience that's actually my blood.

181
00:12:04,026 --> 00:12:07,647
I just put it up to my wrist and it's this low guttural bubbly thing.

182
00:12:07,967 --> 00:12:10,747
So one of the bosses actually has blood ambience in it.

183
00:12:10,767 --> 00:12:13,348
I think it's called bloodambience.wave, which is fantastic.

184
00:12:14,068 --> 00:12:17,109
So now I can officially say that you're all listening to my blood whenever you play that

185
00:12:17,149 --> 00:12:17,869
game, which is great.

186
00:12:18,269 --> 00:12:20,350
But also I use this to record things like my

187
00:12:20,510 --> 00:12:24,693
Freezer and putting it against the floor to get the rumble of the city, all sorts of stuff.

188
00:12:25,173 --> 00:12:28,995
So one example I'm about to play for you is me recording my freezer.

189
00:12:29,496 --> 00:12:33,659
Now normally when you open a freezer you see this kind of rumbling noise, right?

190
00:12:34,179 --> 00:12:37,561
Now recorded with a stethoscope and I just put it right up against the wall, you get

191
00:12:37,581 --> 00:12:38,802
a really interesting sound.

192
00:12:38,882 --> 00:12:43,585
So what you're about to hear is the sound of a freezer just with a little bit of equalizer

193
00:12:43,645 --> 00:12:44,306
on it and that's it.

194
00:12:49,900 --> 00:12:50,581
Pretty neat, right?

195
00:12:51,142 --> 00:12:53,485
So I use this thing all the time for Amy.

196
00:12:53,525 --> 00:12:56,630
That sounded kind of nice and heavenly and pretty cool.

197
00:12:57,051 --> 00:12:58,573
So I use this all the time.

198
00:12:58,613 --> 00:13:02,379
I was that weirdo walking around going like this to things, just like, no, it's fine,

199
00:13:02,399 --> 00:13:02,880
it's fine.

200
00:13:03,160 --> 00:13:03,261
Uh.

201
00:13:03,541 --> 00:13:07,803
Pro tip for sound designers, by the way, in the room who do field recording, buy a construction

202
00:13:07,823 --> 00:13:09,343
vest with the orange and yellow stripes.

203
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:10,263
No one will bother you.

204
00:13:10,283 --> 00:13:13,785
So I put down traffic cones, I wear the construction vest, and I just record stuff.

205
00:13:13,985 --> 00:13:15,665
Even police have walked by me like, hello.

206
00:13:15,966 --> 00:13:16,646
And nothing.

207
00:13:16,846 --> 00:13:17,706
It's totally great.

208
00:13:17,906 --> 00:13:19,407
Everyone assumes you're supposed to be there.

209
00:13:19,427 --> 00:13:21,488
So pro tip for all of you, just buy one off Amazon.

210
00:13:21,728 --> 00:13:22,288
No one will bother you.

211
00:13:22,308 --> 00:13:23,348
You can walk in anywhere.

212
00:13:25,313 --> 00:13:28,595
So, the whole process, almost nothing was right on the first try.

213
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,356
So, I don't want to give you any illusions.

214
00:13:30,496 --> 00:13:32,978
I got up to version 40 on some of these sound effects.

215
00:13:33,458 --> 00:13:35,379
That's okay. That's totally fine.

216
00:13:35,719 --> 00:13:36,840
Tons of revisions are made.

217
00:13:37,160 --> 00:13:39,322
Again, version 40 I think is the highest number,

218
00:13:39,362 --> 00:13:42,384
but there were some sound effects that just gave me nightmares.

219
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:43,644
And I'm going to show you a few in a second.

220
00:13:44,105 --> 00:13:46,246
So, good feedback was really crucial to this.

221
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:50,729
It was really crucial to get good feedback from Alex Preston, the creative director.

222
00:13:51,503 --> 00:13:55,286
And good feedback is really descriptive emotional words.

223
00:13:55,626 --> 00:13:56,928
Hey, I want this to sound lonely.

224
00:13:57,028 --> 00:13:58,129
I want this to sound dark.

225
00:13:58,189 --> 00:13:59,530
I want this to sound nightmarish.

226
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,210
That's great.

227
00:14:00,591 --> 00:14:03,073
What I've also had in the past is, hey, make this sound blue.

228
00:14:03,373 --> 00:14:05,855
Or I've even had one client say, hey, I need this to sound...

229
00:14:05,875 --> 00:14:08,698
And he did this thing with his mouth.

230
00:14:08,738 --> 00:14:10,639
So it took me two months to find out that...

231
00:14:11,874 --> 00:14:16,177
meant aggressive. Terrible feedback. That's the worst. Never do that. But always give

232
00:14:16,277 --> 00:14:21,701
emotional and descriptive words. And lastly, always test your sounds in game. This is crucially

233
00:14:21,741 --> 00:14:25,824
important. Something that sounds perfect on its own, and you think you can imagine it

234
00:14:25,844 --> 00:14:29,226
in your head, like, oh, yeah, I think that would work, might sound terrible in game.

235
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:33,289
And vice versa. There have been times where the sound on its own in Dropbox, like, oh,

236
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:34,009
I'll just check this out.

237
00:14:34,269 --> 00:14:37,151
It sounded terrible, but in the game it was perfect.

238
00:14:37,591 --> 00:14:41,853
So you never know, always, always, always, always, always test your sound and music in

239
00:14:41,893 --> 00:14:42,093
game.

240
00:14:42,853 --> 00:14:45,595
So all this early failure led to great success.

241
00:14:45,715 --> 00:14:48,896
I was brought on at the very beginning of the game, and that's what I recommend you

242
00:14:48,916 --> 00:14:53,659
do for all your audio people, bring them in at the beginning, not, which is most common,

243
00:14:53,759 --> 00:14:58,881
bringing them in really, really late, because it allows them to fail with you and fail upwards

244
00:14:58,941 --> 00:15:01,943
with you and make those same experimentations that you're making.

245
00:15:02,463 --> 00:15:06,245
So, one video I'm about to show you is based on health sound effects.

246
00:15:06,285 --> 00:15:07,545
So I'm going to just show you a quick video.

247
00:15:07,825 --> 00:15:09,066
I just swapped out the health sounds.

248
00:15:09,086 --> 00:15:11,887
And I'm going to show you version 1, 3, 5, 9, and 11.

249
00:15:12,227 --> 00:15:13,288
I'm not going to show you all 11.

250
00:15:13,788 --> 00:15:15,609
And you're going to hear how some of them just don't fit,

251
00:15:15,689 --> 00:15:17,410
but it started to gel as time went on.

252
00:15:27,161 --> 00:15:29,842
And the last one is the one we eventually ended up deciding on.

253
00:15:29,942 --> 00:15:32,524
So, it took some time, but it worked out in the end

254
00:15:32,584 --> 00:15:35,385
because I had those three years to play around and experiment.

255
00:15:35,906 --> 00:15:38,467
Now, next up is a video that took about...

256
00:15:38,607 --> 00:15:39,988
that's taken about two years...

257
00:15:40,048 --> 00:15:41,949
No, one and a half years into the development cycle.

258
00:15:42,269 --> 00:15:44,170
So, this is when the game's sound started to gel.

259
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:45,551
Again, it took one and a half years.

260
00:15:59,719 --> 00:16:04,303
All right. And next up is a video of the game when it was released with all of its sound design.

261
00:16:04,323 --> 00:16:06,825
And you're going to hear some ambiences. The sound's a little more refined.

262
00:16:07,105 --> 00:16:09,127
The dash sounds better. Little things like that.

263
00:16:23,700 --> 00:16:26,122
Also, there's a cool sword spinning. I love that.

264
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,202
Alright, so some of my favorite effects, in terms of audio effects and plugins and all that sort of stuff,

265
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:38,204
were Logic's Bit Crusher, and a Bit Crusher is basically something that lops off or cuts off a bunch of bits of your sound,

266
00:16:38,224 --> 00:16:44,067
which can make it sound really old-school or distorted in this really cool, unpleasant way,

267
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:48,048
which I used a ton on Hyper Light Drifter, you got this nice static-to-everything reverb,

268
00:16:48,108 --> 00:16:50,289
which I think is the fairy dust of the audio world.

269
00:16:50,649 --> 00:16:52,110
Put it on everything, it's great.

270
00:16:52,170 --> 00:16:53,910
Just put more reverb on if you have a problem.

271
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:55,011
Not actually, but that's...

272
00:16:56,292 --> 00:16:58,953
My favorite reverb is Audio Damage's Eos Reverb.

273
00:16:59,013 --> 00:17:03,234
It has an infinite setting, so I turn on infinite, I hit go, I make a sandwich, I come back and

274
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:04,855
I have this crazy warped effect.

275
00:17:05,115 --> 00:17:05,855
It's fantastic.

276
00:17:06,336 --> 00:17:10,877
And lastly, Native Instruments' Absynth is this insane synthesizer that allows you to

277
00:17:10,957 --> 00:17:13,338
kind of do anything so long as it's weird.

278
00:17:13,718 --> 00:17:18,620
It allows you to make really strange sci-fi and otherworldly effects very, very straightforwardly

279
00:17:18,680 --> 00:17:19,421
and very easily.

280
00:17:19,721 --> 00:17:21,341
So I use this a ton for Hyperlite.

281
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:25,344
Now just some few tips for working with audio professionals before we finish up.

282
00:17:25,784 --> 00:17:29,227
Hire early, again, get them early so they can fail upwards with you

283
00:17:29,287 --> 00:17:32,029
because that's all game development is, and when you don't get them early,

284
00:17:32,049 --> 00:17:37,373
which is all too common, you rob them of the ability to grow with the team

285
00:17:37,453 --> 00:17:41,435
and create with the rest of the team, which is probably what you actually want

286
00:17:41,495 --> 00:17:43,437
because then you'll get the best result possible.

287
00:17:44,117 --> 00:17:46,098
Establish common terms. This is really important.

288
00:17:46,458 --> 00:17:50,319
Make sure that what you're saying and what the audio people are saying mean the same thing,

289
00:17:50,339 --> 00:17:51,819
and I'm going to talk about that in just a second.

290
00:17:52,539 --> 00:17:55,640
And expect iteration. Obviously, nothing's going to be right on the first try.

291
00:17:56,140 --> 00:17:58,201
Again, version 40 for some sound effects.

292
00:17:59,021 --> 00:18:01,881
And get a style guide. So this will help you establish common terms.

293
00:18:02,002 --> 00:18:05,102
A style guide can be a concept piece of music, which is pretty common.

294
00:18:05,442 --> 00:18:07,243
But you can also get concept sound design.

295
00:18:07,743 --> 00:18:13,589
What I like to do for clients is give a one to two minute audio demonstration, essentially,

296
00:18:13,609 --> 00:18:15,430
of here's what I think the game will sound like.

297
00:18:15,751 --> 00:18:21,376
It has everything from combat in there, it has ambiences, everything else is in that one to two minutes,

298
00:18:21,596 --> 00:18:24,959
so that if you close your eyes you can almost imagine yourself playing a game.

299
00:18:25,480 --> 00:18:29,864
And then from there you'll hear the developer or creative director, whoever it may be, say things like,

300
00:18:30,404 --> 00:18:33,467
Oh, I like that that sounds in tune, or that sounds really dark.

301
00:18:33,527 --> 00:18:35,228
I don't think I want this game to sound really dark.

302
00:18:35,269 --> 00:18:38,912
And you're just nodding and taking all these terms and be like, okay, dark means this.

303
00:18:39,472 --> 00:18:42,835
And then you start to realize what they're saying, what they really mean

304
00:18:43,135 --> 00:18:46,038
when they're talking about audio, because it's such an intangible thing.

305
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:50,142
It's very hard to describe, and everyone has their own unique way of describing it.

306
00:18:50,582 --> 00:18:53,064
For example, for Hyper Light Drifter, sorry, Alex.

307
00:18:53,985 --> 00:18:55,786
So when he said...

308
00:18:56,807 --> 00:18:59,090
Hey, this sounds really out of tune.

309
00:18:59,190 --> 00:19:01,473
He actually meant this sounds really in tune.

310
00:19:01,813 --> 00:19:05,037
If I played something perfectly pitched on the piano, he's like, no, I don't like it,

311
00:19:05,057 --> 00:19:05,617
it's out of tune.

312
00:19:05,898 --> 00:19:09,482
But if I played something that was out of tune, like really pitched warp, he's like,

313
00:19:09,662 --> 00:19:11,123
I like that, that's in tune, that's nice.

314
00:19:12,044 --> 00:19:15,766
So I would have never known that if it wasn't for that style guide early on.

315
00:19:15,786 --> 00:19:20,488
And that would have killed months of development because I would have kept making like in-tune stuff.

316
00:19:20,528 --> 00:19:22,249
And he's like, nope, it's out of tune. Why?

317
00:19:22,269 --> 00:19:26,291
I was like, oh, okay, it turns out your ears are super weird and you have a weird way of describing this.

318
00:19:26,631 --> 00:19:30,953
But thanks to the style guide, it was very easy and very straightforward to do all of that.

319
00:19:31,253 --> 00:19:34,874
So we blazed through this in under 25 minutes. Yes! Thank you all so much.

320
00:19:35,495 --> 00:19:36,595
You can feel free to ask questions.

321
00:19:36,615 --> 00:19:39,116
And I'll be hanging out during the conference and all that sort of good stuff.

322
00:19:40,337 --> 00:19:40,937
Here's all my stuff.

323
00:19:47,042 --> 00:19:49,525
So if anyone has questions, we have a couple minutes, so feel

324
00:19:49,545 --> 00:19:50,026
free to ask.

325
00:19:53,750 --> 00:19:56,152
How did you get involved with Alex Preston?

326
00:19:56,613 --> 00:20:00,537
Yes, so how I got involved with the project in general is I

327
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,199
actually saw it go up on Kickstarter.

328
00:20:02,239 --> 00:20:04,321
So I got in right after the Kickstarter finished, and I

329
00:20:04,421 --> 00:20:05,222
literally emailed him.

330
00:20:05,242 --> 00:20:06,243
I was like, hey, I'll do good.

331
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:10,460
That was it. I wish I had the email for you because it's literally one line,

332
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:13,001
and I actually teach other people how to break into games,

333
00:20:13,041 --> 00:20:14,841
like, don't write long emails, you'll never get a gig.

334
00:20:15,141 --> 00:20:18,262
But I was like, hey, can I do it? I'll do good.

335
00:20:18,982 --> 00:20:21,223
Okay. That was it. That was the end of it.

336
00:20:21,443 --> 00:20:23,884
No one else was emailing. Everyone was like, here's my reel.

337
00:20:24,104 --> 00:20:26,284
Oh, I can't wait to work. I was just like, I'll do a good job.

338
00:20:26,644 --> 00:20:28,265
No reel, no website, no nothing. So that's...

339
00:20:29,065 --> 00:20:30,325
I'm kind of a weirdo in that way.

340
00:20:32,486 --> 00:20:32,906
Anything else?

341
00:20:33,906 --> 00:20:35,067
Time for maybe one or two more.

342
00:20:41,802 --> 00:20:45,044
Are you involved in middleware like FMOD or...?

343
00:20:46,105 --> 00:20:48,927
Yes, so am I involved in middleware like FMOD or Wwise?

344
00:20:49,007 --> 00:20:49,368
Yes.

345
00:20:49,408 --> 00:20:51,029
So for this project we didn't have any.

346
00:20:51,049 --> 00:20:55,252
It was made in GameMaker which has the worst audio engine ever.

347
00:20:55,792 --> 00:21:00,696
But with other projects like Unity, Unreal, any other engine or just custom engines,

348
00:21:00,716 --> 00:21:04,739
yeah, I use FMOD and Wwise very heavily whenever I get a chance.

349
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:10,605
For those of you who don't know, Fmod and Wwise are pieces of middleware that allow non-programmers like me to

350
00:21:11,006 --> 00:21:16,811
interact, create interactive sound and music within games, set up the logic so that the programmer just needs to hook it up really quickly

351
00:21:16,871 --> 00:21:18,433
and really easily and call it good.

352
00:21:19,754 --> 00:21:20,135
Anything else?

353
00:21:29,406 --> 00:21:34,068
How would you go about sound design in a game with a relatively low budget?

354
00:21:34,088 --> 00:21:38,131
Because you talked about buying the wire recorder, which was $200, and things like that.

355
00:21:38,151 --> 00:21:39,792
So how would you go about that in a low-budget game?

356
00:21:40,072 --> 00:21:43,034
Yeah, totally. So you don't need to buy this sort of equipment.

357
00:21:43,114 --> 00:21:45,595
I was able to, so that's why I did it, and it sounded cool.

358
00:21:45,615 --> 00:21:48,697
But for low-budget games, if you're doing sound design for low-budget games,

359
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:53,660
honestly, a very cheap and easy way is to either, A, if you're not a sound designer,

360
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:57,402
you can buy a sound design library for the type of stuff that you need.

361
00:21:57,862 --> 00:22:00,885
Or B, you can hire someone who is good at recording their own stuff.

362
00:22:00,925 --> 00:22:05,168
So most sound designers have some sort of microphone set up that they can use, and you

363
00:22:05,188 --> 00:22:06,489
can record all that stuff at home.

364
00:22:06,769 --> 00:22:12,113
Unless you're getting something really strange like tigers or gunshots, which actually you

365
00:22:12,133 --> 00:22:15,955
can find on the internet pretty easily, then you'll be able to record most of it on your

366
00:22:15,996 --> 00:22:18,477
own and that's a really good low budget way to go about it.

367
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:22,460
So libraries and recording it yourself using some sort of set up are good ways to go about

368
00:22:22,500 --> 00:22:22,540
it.

369
00:22:26,314 --> 00:22:28,777
All right. Thank you all so much. I'll be hanging out. So if

370
00:22:28,797 --> 00:22:30,439
you want to chat more, feel free to ask.
