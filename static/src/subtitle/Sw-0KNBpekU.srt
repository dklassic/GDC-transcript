1
00:00:05,688 --> 00:00:08,189
Good morning. Thanks for coming in so early.

2
00:00:08,189 --> 00:00:09,950
This is Watch Dogs, Hacking It to 11.

3
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:12,431
Thanks, everybody, for coming over,

4
00:00:12,431 --> 00:00:15,673
and we're really grateful that GDC had us

5
00:00:15,673 --> 00:00:18,875
and allowed us to come and do this talk for you guys.

6
00:00:18,875 --> 00:00:21,956
We did Watch Dogs, and we shipped it about a year ago,

7
00:00:21,956 --> 00:00:24,097
and we're really glad we can talk to you about

8
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:25,918
a bit more about the music system

9
00:00:25,918 --> 00:00:27,579
and everything that's music in the game

10
00:00:27,579 --> 00:00:28,940
and how that came about for the game.

11
00:00:30,393 --> 00:00:33,495
I'm Olivier Girard, I'm the audio director on the project.

12
00:00:33,495 --> 00:00:37,659
I'm Pavel Maximichev, and I'm the audio designer and the

13
00:00:37,659 --> 00:00:38,680
composer for the game.

14
00:00:39,458 --> 00:00:41,379
So essentially, we wanted to do a talk

15
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:44,181
that covered the whole aspect of audio on Watch Dogs.

16
00:00:44,181 --> 00:00:45,541
And we started writing it, and we figured

17
00:00:45,541 --> 00:00:47,382
that was way too much stuff to talk about.

18
00:00:47,382 --> 00:00:48,483
So we decided to figure it.

19
00:00:48,483 --> 00:00:52,545
We figured we'll stick to music, which is what proved to be

20
00:00:52,545 --> 00:00:54,086
the most challenging thing for us

21
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:56,668
as we had to, you know, reconcile the open world

22
00:00:56,668 --> 00:00:58,569
with our own creative objectives

23
00:00:58,569 --> 00:01:00,190
we're gonna get to in about a second.

24
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:03,732
What we knew from the get-go, we got on Watch Dogs

25
00:01:03,732 --> 00:01:06,713
just when we finished SpinnerCell Conviction

26
00:01:06,713 --> 00:01:07,914
about 5 1⁄2 years ago.

27
00:01:07,914 --> 00:01:08,154
And...

28
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:12,537
all we knew at the time, Watch Dogs was becoming its own thing, was we were

29
00:01:12,537 --> 00:01:16,380
establishing a new brand, and all we knew was a Serious Stone open world game

30
00:01:16,380 --> 00:01:19,222
focused on hacking and the concern raised by technology and all that.

31
00:01:19,222 --> 00:01:24,946
So, Serious Stone was basically all we got, you know, as a major direction from the game.

32
00:01:24,946 --> 00:01:28,428
And that's going to be reflected throughout the whole presentation, because that's

33
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:29,749
the one thing we kept grabbing onto,

34
00:01:29,749 --> 00:01:32,051
you know, we want to do a Serious Stone thing.

35
00:01:32,051 --> 00:01:35,753
Obviously, you know, doing open world games with a lot of driving and shooting.

36
00:01:35,993 --> 00:01:38,556
uh... there's a lot of of of other

37
00:01:38,556 --> 00:01:42,020
games happening at the same time and some are humorous some are goofy and all that

38
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:42,420
and I think

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,584
that was our way of trying to be different it was you know trying to stick

40
00:01:45,584 --> 00:01:46,325
to that serious tone.

41
00:01:47,569 --> 00:01:53,032
It was a long development cycle and it was the first time for us to actually be part of the pre-production phase.

42
00:01:53,032 --> 00:01:58,976
I'd been at Ubi for a while and had done a lot of crunches, a lot of production phases, but never in pre-production.

43
00:01:58,976 --> 00:02:07,021
So that was a bit uneasy at first, getting into that rhythm of not actually always wrestling with tasks and all that to be doing,

44
00:02:07,021 --> 00:02:12,184
but having deeper thoughts about the whole creative direction and the sound direction of the game.

45
00:02:13,283 --> 00:02:15,524
Also, it was a very large team.

46
00:02:15,524 --> 00:02:19,487
I was used to working with five, six people maximum on a project.

47
00:02:19,487 --> 00:02:23,890
And then we got on Watch Dogs, and eventually we were, you know, this team working just

48
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:24,290
in Montreal.

49
00:02:24,290 --> 00:02:27,572
And we had other friends as well working in the Paris studios.

50
00:02:27,572 --> 00:02:30,874
We had friends in Newcastle, and we had people in Quebec City all working on sound.

51
00:02:30,874 --> 00:02:35,077
And I think the guys at the Star Control talk...

52
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:36,778
said it best yesterday.

53
00:02:36,778 --> 00:02:38,438
They said, you know, they embraced standing

54
00:02:38,438 --> 00:02:40,959
on the shoulder of giants, of other people.

55
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:42,280
And that's pretty much what we're doing here.

56
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:43,760
I mean, we get to be here today

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,402
because all these people worked really hard on the game,

58
00:02:46,402 --> 00:02:48,402
and we wouldn't be here without them.

59
00:02:48,402 --> 00:02:51,304
We needed that many people just to ship the game

60
00:02:51,304 --> 00:02:52,764
in the state we wanted it to be.

61
00:02:52,764 --> 00:02:54,625
So we're really grateful about that.

62
00:02:54,625 --> 00:02:56,045
And also the relationship we had

63
00:02:56,045 --> 00:02:58,206
with our creative director, Jonathan Morin,

64
00:02:58,206 --> 00:03:00,067
and our producer, Dominique Guay,

65
00:03:00,067 --> 00:03:02,888
who really enabled us to, you know, achieve our goals

66
00:03:02,888 --> 00:03:04,829
and really reach as far as we could.

67
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:06,491
with this brand-new IP.

68
00:03:06,491 --> 00:03:08,073
So we're really grateful about that as well.

69
00:03:08,073 --> 00:03:11,737
So as I said about the audio direction,

70
00:03:11,737 --> 00:03:13,979
uh, you know, it wasn't like we came on board

71
00:03:13,979 --> 00:03:15,341
the project five and a half years ago

72
00:03:15,341 --> 00:03:16,602
and said, oh, this is what it's gonna be.

73
00:03:16,602 --> 00:03:18,945
It was, uh, there was a lot of iterations,

74
00:03:18,945 --> 00:03:21,027
obviously because, you know, the game was finding itself.

75
00:03:21,027 --> 00:03:22,629
We were trying to define what we were gonna be.

76
00:03:22,629 --> 00:03:23,911
And we were trying to, you know...

77
00:03:25,212 --> 00:03:27,413
get in sync with what the creative direction was doing,

78
00:03:27,413 --> 00:03:30,335
what the game designers were doing and all that.

79
00:03:30,335 --> 00:03:32,957
But what was really, really important for us on Wazhogs,

80
00:03:32,957 --> 00:03:34,979
and another thing we're really grateful about,

81
00:03:34,979 --> 00:03:38,581
is we had full control and full authority over sound.

82
00:03:38,581 --> 00:03:42,944
It might not be so obvious when, you know, you don't have it,

83
00:03:42,944 --> 00:03:44,465
but to get that on a project...

84
00:03:45,065 --> 00:03:47,386
is really important because we get to push our ideas,

85
00:03:47,386 --> 00:03:49,967
and then we get to sell them to the creative director,

86
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:51,968
and they can buy in or not into this,

87
00:03:51,968 --> 00:03:53,709
but at least it comes from us.

88
00:03:53,709 --> 00:03:56,290
It's a, you know, bottoms-up perspective on things,

89
00:03:56,290 --> 00:03:58,431
whereas other times, you'll be on a different project,

90
00:03:58,431 --> 00:04:00,752
and the creative vision is gonna be so strong

91
00:04:00,752 --> 00:04:03,073
that you'll become a service to that creative vision.

92
00:04:03,073 --> 00:04:05,914
On Watch Dogs, we really were given a lot of, um...

93
00:04:06,972 --> 00:04:13,079
of room to define ourselves what we wanted this game to be about from an audio perspective

94
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,784
and that really helped us define exactly what Watch Dogs was about.

95
00:04:17,905 --> 00:04:19,826
And what it was about, basically, as I said,

96
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,828
we were just coming off of Spinner Cell Conviction,

97
00:04:22,828 --> 00:04:25,349
and we'd done a lot of interactive music,

98
00:04:25,349 --> 00:04:27,451
but also music that reacted really closely

99
00:04:27,451 --> 00:04:28,812
to what the action was.

100
00:04:28,812 --> 00:04:31,073
And we really, really enjoyed doing that

101
00:04:31,073 --> 00:04:33,114
with the systems for Spinner Cell.

102
00:04:33,114 --> 00:04:35,896
And we decided, well, now we're doing an open world game,

103
00:04:35,896 --> 00:04:38,898
so in theory, this wouldn't be the best approach.

104
00:04:38,898 --> 00:04:41,199
But we decided to challenge ourselves a bit and say,

105
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,141
how can we make the most tailor-made music

106
00:04:44,141 --> 00:04:46,203
for all these moments the player is gonna live?

107
00:04:46,943 --> 00:04:50,966
but still try to make it work with a total freedom promise of the open world.

108
00:04:50,966 --> 00:04:54,369
So that was basically the challenge we put ourselves through

109
00:04:54,369 --> 00:04:56,070
because we really, really enjoyed those moments.

110
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,052
And we said, you know, this is the best way to get, you know,

111
00:04:58,052 --> 00:05:00,174
the maximum emotional impact of the game

112
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:04,257
is to support these moments with as close a soundtrack as we can have

113
00:05:04,257 --> 00:05:06,498
that reacts to what the player is actually doing.

114
00:05:06,498 --> 00:05:09,281
So, you know, if we realize that the player is, you know,

115
00:05:09,281 --> 00:05:12,163
taking a car and crashing through windows, then can we...

116
00:05:12,884 --> 00:05:16,450
find a way to note that, and can we see that,

117
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,433
and can we support the music?

118
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:20,617
Can the music support those actions?

119
00:05:20,617 --> 00:05:22,700
I'm not saying this is what we did in the end,

120
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,564
but that was our reasoning from the beginning.

121
00:05:24,564 --> 00:05:26,086
This is what we were trying to achieve.

122
00:05:27,017 --> 00:05:29,720
minimal systems and more mission-based custom tracks.

123
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:32,662
Obviously, we couldn't get, you know, too far away from systems

124
00:05:32,662 --> 00:05:35,925
because the open world still demanded a lot of feedback

125
00:05:35,925 --> 00:05:38,007
and still demanded a lot of attention

126
00:05:38,007 --> 00:05:41,070
because gameplay was kind of king on Watch Dogs

127
00:05:41,070 --> 00:05:42,732
and we wanted to be sure that the gameplay

128
00:05:42,732 --> 00:05:44,913
was getting all the feedbacks it needed.

129
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:47,075
And a lot of times, a lot of what was happening in the game,

130
00:05:47,075 --> 00:05:48,717
like the vigilante system and all that,

131
00:05:49,117 --> 00:05:52,859
was very subtle and since you know our character didn't necessarily have a

132
00:05:52,859 --> 00:05:55,080
a spider sense thing or whatnot

133
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,241
oftentimes the the solution to those problems how to bring the players

134
00:05:58,241 --> 00:05:59,542
attention to something that's going on

135
00:05:59,542 --> 00:06:02,083
you know very far away down the street

136
00:06:02,083 --> 00:06:05,904
was to change the music or have a specific cue play at a specific time

137
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,926
or when the the police were chasing you and all that so

138
00:06:08,926 --> 00:06:12,447
a lot of the times you know we we did need those systems to be there

139
00:06:12,447 --> 00:06:15,248
just so we could have the proper gameplay feedback for the player so

140
00:06:15,248 --> 00:06:16,529
obviously that created

141
00:06:16,709 --> 00:06:19,973
uh... you know if we have a few conflicts in the game and you know how

142
00:06:19,973 --> 00:06:20,673
we resolve them

143
00:06:20,673 --> 00:06:23,957
is is pretty much you know the the meat and potatoes of this talk

144
00:06:25,674 --> 00:06:32,756
So reconciling all these systems obviously there was technical concerns as well because we couldn't have you know 11 streams of music playing all the same time

145
00:06:32,756 --> 00:06:38,277
Technically we would have gotten a lot of angry engine programmers at our desk if we'd attempted that

146
00:06:38,277 --> 00:06:45,178
And also we were doing a cross gen game which implied that you know however far we would push with the next-gen technology

147
00:06:45,178 --> 00:06:50,039
The current gen guys would hate us that much more so we still want to be friends with them

148
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:53,780
So you know we try to find a common ground that everybody was happy with what we were doing

149
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,380
but also from a technical perspective,

150
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:57,021
there's just so many stuff you can cram

151
00:06:57,021 --> 00:06:58,823
at the same time through the streams.

152
00:06:58,823 --> 00:07:01,004
We had a lot of readability concerns as well

153
00:07:01,004 --> 00:07:02,985
because it, you know, we could have a lot,

154
00:07:02,985 --> 00:07:04,786
you know, a guy with a boom box

155
00:07:04,786 --> 00:07:06,307
and then you're in your car with your own radio

156
00:07:06,307 --> 00:07:08,328
and then there's mission music playing on top

157
00:07:08,328 --> 00:07:10,830
and that just creates a mess of music really.

158
00:07:10,830 --> 00:07:13,331
And if you have, you know, music everywhere,

159
00:07:13,331 --> 00:07:14,352
then you get to the next point,

160
00:07:14,352 --> 00:07:15,532
which is the density concern.

161
00:07:15,532 --> 00:07:17,394
If you got music playing all the time,

162
00:07:17,394 --> 00:07:18,774
the next time it comes in,

163
00:07:18,774 --> 00:07:20,435
it kind of loses its impact a bit.

164
00:07:20,435 --> 00:07:21,476
So, you know, we wanted to be sure

165
00:07:21,476 --> 00:07:23,277
that there's also some times where there's no music.

166
00:07:23,697 --> 00:07:25,778
Or the player can choose to have new music,

167
00:07:25,778 --> 00:07:28,819
so when it comes back in, then it actually means something.

168
00:07:28,819 --> 00:07:32,420
And also, the open world promise, obviously,

169
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:34,901
was the main thing that we always had to keep in mind.

170
00:07:34,901 --> 00:07:38,283
Because every time we thought we had a good idea,

171
00:07:38,283 --> 00:07:39,883
suddenly we switched our brain to QA mode.

172
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,024
And we're like, so what happens if the player decides

173
00:07:42,024 --> 00:07:45,665
to take an ambulance and drive backwards through the store

174
00:07:45,665 --> 00:07:46,906
as people are calling the police?

175
00:07:46,906 --> 00:07:47,746
Is that still going to work?

176
00:07:47,746 --> 00:07:49,907
And most often, that answer would be no.

177
00:07:49,907 --> 00:07:51,948
And we would have to find another solution.

178
00:07:52,368 --> 00:07:57,431
But that's everything, you know, that's setting the table for the project for the next four years we had to do.

179
00:07:57,431 --> 00:08:00,614
And the first casualty of that was the Muse ambient system.

180
00:08:00,614 --> 00:08:03,496
When we started thinking about Watch Dogs, we knew it was a serious game,

181
00:08:03,496 --> 00:08:07,558
and we knew it was an open world, so we started thinking about our favorite references,

182
00:08:07,558 --> 00:08:10,260
and when that came up was obviously Fallout.

183
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,682
And so we played a lot of Fallout,

184
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,984
and we're like, oh, wow, this game really nails,

185
00:08:14,984 --> 00:08:17,046
you know, selling the Fallout universe

186
00:08:17,046 --> 00:08:20,689
through music and through those small musical cues

187
00:08:20,689 --> 00:08:22,290
that come in and out of the environment.

188
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:23,091
They're not pieces.

189
00:08:23,091 --> 00:08:24,632
They're just small musical phrases

190
00:08:24,632 --> 00:08:25,012
that come in and out.

191
00:08:25,012 --> 00:08:27,114
I'm like, this is brilliant. Let's try that.

192
00:08:27,114 --> 00:08:29,436
So we had our composer make a bunch of these things,

193
00:08:29,436 --> 00:08:31,978
and we had, you know, a bunch of them

194
00:08:31,978 --> 00:08:33,019
for every act of the game,

195
00:08:33,019 --> 00:08:35,701
and we were super happy with the system.

196
00:08:35,701 --> 00:08:38,283
And then it hit us, once everything was in place,

197
00:08:38,283 --> 00:08:39,424
that, you know, a...

198
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:43,047
a dense, living Chicago,

199
00:08:43,047 --> 00:08:46,609
is not the same audio landscape at all as the wasteland.

200
00:08:46,609 --> 00:08:48,110
So there's much less room in the mix

201
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:50,212
for these small, subtle things to come in.

202
00:08:50,212 --> 00:08:52,113
And obviously, we reached that density concern as well,

203
00:08:52,113 --> 00:08:54,955
where there was always some kind of music playing at the same time.

204
00:08:54,955 --> 00:08:57,857
So we said, all right, let's take all these very expensive things we bought

205
00:08:57,857 --> 00:08:59,498
and put them aside for now

206
00:08:59,498 --> 00:09:02,721
and see if we can do something else with them later on.

207
00:09:02,721 --> 00:09:05,783
So we, you know, we learned a hard lesson right there.

208
00:09:05,783 --> 00:09:09,025
This is an example of these small musical phrases we had.

209
00:09:35,227 --> 00:09:38,849
So really the objective there was really let's sell the flavor of the game.

210
00:09:38,849 --> 00:09:42,372
Let's say this is Watch Dogs, this is new, this is a serious game.

211
00:09:42,372 --> 00:09:45,354
So hopefully that's what you got from this small piece.

212
00:09:45,354 --> 00:09:48,657
But that was the direction we were going for.

213
00:09:48,657 --> 00:09:49,298
Obviously.

214
00:09:49,698 --> 00:09:53,081
conflicts, many systems trying to fight at the same time.

215
00:09:53,081 --> 00:09:55,643
And we had to make sure all those systems existed together

216
00:09:55,643 --> 00:09:57,244
and the system was smart enough to realize

217
00:09:57,244 --> 00:09:58,505
when there should be a transition.

218
00:09:58,505 --> 00:10:01,668
So what you see here is our glorious music tree,

219
00:10:01,668 --> 00:10:04,010
which was made by our programmers in Montreal,

220
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:06,832
which basically looks at the game and sees,

221
00:10:06,832 --> 00:10:08,493
well, what part of the game am I in?

222
00:10:08,493 --> 00:10:09,314
Is this the first act?

223
00:10:09,314 --> 00:10:11,836
Is this the later act of the game?

224
00:10:11,836 --> 00:10:14,358
Maybe what kind of, what district am I in?

225
00:10:14,358 --> 00:10:15,819
Or am I in a mission?

226
00:10:15,819 --> 00:10:16,400
Am I not in a mission?

227
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:18,081
Is the police chasing me?

228
00:10:18,081 --> 00:10:19,362
Is there a vigilante of it going on?

229
00:10:19,622 --> 00:10:20,903
And there's a whole bunch of priorities

230
00:10:20,903 --> 00:10:22,343
within all those systems.

231
00:10:22,343 --> 00:10:23,884
And this is basically the overall,

232
00:10:23,884 --> 00:10:24,784
I'd say, music system.

233
00:10:24,784 --> 00:10:27,605
Because once you get into an actual mission of the game,

234
00:10:27,605 --> 00:10:29,285
then this is kind of overruled.

235
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:32,026
And then the music, the missions actually take over,

236
00:10:32,026 --> 00:10:33,747
and they have their own music conditions

237
00:10:33,747 --> 00:10:35,147
that are set through scripts.

238
00:10:35,147 --> 00:10:37,788
So let's say a mission had you, uh, obviously,

239
00:10:37,788 --> 00:10:39,228
from, uh, let's say...

240
00:10:39,368 --> 00:10:41,369
pick apples because that's very watchdogs.

241
00:10:41,369 --> 00:10:43,830
But let's say a mission had you pick apples in an orchard,

242
00:10:43,830 --> 00:10:45,351
then maybe we would try to hook ourselves up

243
00:10:45,351 --> 00:10:47,072
to the amount of apple in your basket,

244
00:10:47,072 --> 00:10:49,292
and then the music would fluctuate around that.

245
00:10:49,292 --> 00:10:50,813
So that was the main objective.

246
00:10:50,813 --> 00:10:52,554
And every mission had different objectives,

247
00:10:52,554 --> 00:10:54,755
so we would try to find the objective of the mission

248
00:10:54,755 --> 00:10:57,696
and make sure the actual scripts reacted to that.

249
00:10:57,696 --> 00:10:59,417
But when you were not in the mission

250
00:10:59,417 --> 00:11:01,918
and all the other systems were trying to play the music,

251
00:11:01,918 --> 00:11:03,758
whether it be the source diegetic music,

252
00:11:03,758 --> 00:11:05,199
whether it was the in-car music,

253
00:11:05,199 --> 00:11:07,160
all that had to go through the music tree.

254
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,803
and then the music tree would decide,

255
00:11:09,803 --> 00:11:12,065
okay, now we can play this, now we can play that.

256
00:11:12,065 --> 00:11:15,089
So this is a bit of a closer look to it.

257
00:11:15,089 --> 00:11:16,590
Obviously, it's very programmer-friendly.

258
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:19,474
I wouldn't... we weren't working too much in there.

259
00:11:19,474 --> 00:11:21,456
We were just sitting down with our programmers

260
00:11:21,456 --> 00:11:24,219
and telling them what we wanted, and they made this.

261
00:11:24,219 --> 00:11:26,001
I captured it because I think it's really impressive,

262
00:11:26,001 --> 00:11:28,063
but I wouldn't be able to remake it myself.

263
00:11:30,290 --> 00:11:33,292
And so obviously now this is the theory behind it.

264
00:11:33,292 --> 00:11:36,875
And here, what we decided to do as well is,

265
00:11:36,875 --> 00:11:38,997
what we were doing on Splinter Cell actually was,

266
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:40,198
you know, the music was interactive

267
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:41,559
and working on a layer system,

268
00:11:41,559 --> 00:11:44,382
which would have different layers coming in and out,

269
00:11:44,382 --> 00:11:46,023
depending on the action on screen.

270
00:11:46,023 --> 00:11:49,426
And we wanted to work with parts for our music

271
00:11:49,426 --> 00:11:51,688
so we could have a better impact at any given moment.

272
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:53,770
So how parts work, Pavel can explain a bit more.

273
00:11:53,770 --> 00:11:55,071
He's more musically minded.

274
00:11:55,635 --> 00:11:56,595
Right now or later?

275
00:11:56,595 --> 00:11:57,196
Yeah, now, right now.

276
00:11:57,196 --> 00:11:57,416
OK, sure.

277
00:11:57,416 --> 00:11:59,297
But the thing is that with parts,

278
00:11:59,297 --> 00:12:02,479
it's very economical memory-wise, processing-wise.

279
00:12:02,479 --> 00:12:04,620
It's a perfect solution for us.

280
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,342
I mean, we can basically construct the piece,

281
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:10,724
chopped it up, and then we can reuse the parts accordingly.

282
00:12:10,724 --> 00:12:13,806
But the best concern, well, I mean,

283
00:12:13,806 --> 00:12:18,029
the most concerning problem was really the memory constraints.

284
00:12:18,029 --> 00:12:20,110
Because if we have a three-minute piece,

285
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:22,433
times eight layers, three minutes.

286
00:12:22,433 --> 00:12:25,276
It takes a certain chart on the processor and memory, so.

287
00:12:25,276 --> 00:12:25,896
Exactly.

288
00:12:25,896 --> 00:12:28,759
So basically, the themes we're calling them,

289
00:12:28,759 --> 00:12:30,641
because that's how our system called them,

290
00:12:30,641 --> 00:12:32,383
basically the themes were being shuffled around

291
00:12:32,383 --> 00:12:33,524
depending on the action on screen.

292
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:35,206
So that's what you're going to see here in this example.

293
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:37,427
And basically, you see everything that's happening

294
00:12:37,427 --> 00:12:39,288
in the game, and you'll see the system react

295
00:12:39,288 --> 00:12:40,329
to what was happening.

296
00:12:40,329 --> 00:12:42,510
And the theme thing is that it's,

297
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:44,551
since it's, you know, working in parts,

298
00:12:44,551 --> 00:12:45,852
sometimes it's gonna work,

299
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:47,573
it's gonna wait until the end of a part

300
00:12:47,573 --> 00:12:49,174
to switch over to the next part.

301
00:12:49,174 --> 00:12:51,035
Uh, so that's why sometimes you'll see

302
00:12:51,035 --> 00:12:53,176
there's a bit of a, maybe a, of an,

303
00:12:53,176 --> 00:12:55,317
a bit of a delay between the actual action

304
00:12:55,317 --> 00:12:56,558
and when the music reacts to it.

305
00:12:56,558 --> 00:12:58,459
But when it does, it's not just, you know,

306
00:12:58,459 --> 00:12:59,539
a new layer fading in.

307
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:01,280
It's really, uh, there's an impact there.

308
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:03,141
There's a, a better, uh...

309
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:19,975
There's a bit of editing going on for, you know, time's sake.

310
00:13:19,975 --> 00:13:20,235
Sorry.

311
00:13:20,235 --> 00:13:20,736
Sorry.

312
00:13:20,736 --> 00:13:21,016
Sorry.

313
00:13:21,016 --> 00:13:21,256
Sorry.

314
00:13:21,256 --> 00:13:21,596
Sorry.

315
00:13:21,596 --> 00:13:25,777
Sorry.

316
00:13:25,777 --> 00:13:26,397
Sorry.

317
00:13:26,397 --> 00:13:27,158
Sorry.

318
00:13:27,158 --> 00:13:27,918
Sorry.

319
00:13:27,918 --> 00:13:29,058
Sorry.

320
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:29,479
Sorry.

321
00:13:29,479 --> 00:13:30,199
Sorry.

322
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:30,859
Sorry.

323
00:13:42,769 --> 00:13:53,352
Watch all units. Initiating CQS scan for suspect.

324
00:13:53,352 --> 00:14:02,535
All units, CQS scan completed. Suspect location is being distributed now.

325
00:14:02,535 --> 00:14:08,016
We've got a patrol car in pursuit of suspect.

326
00:14:26,479 --> 00:14:30,042
Damn, where did he go?

327
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:42,791
Squad, suspect active. We're on him.

328
00:14:42,791 --> 00:14:48,035
To the cliff, over.

329
00:14:48,035 --> 00:14:52,478
To the cliff, over.

330
00:15:09,577 --> 00:15:13,048
Suspect on the move. Track location and report back. Over.

331
00:15:13,048 --> 00:15:16,720
Copy that. A patrol car is heading your way.

332
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,141
Now!

333
00:15:47,141 --> 00:16:00,951
Shut off your vehicle and give yourself up!

334
00:16:22,252 --> 00:16:27,857
So this wasn't a mission, this was all due to systemic aspects of the game.

335
00:16:27,857 --> 00:16:32,660
So that was the main music system driving what you hear and what you see on screen right

336
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:32,780
now.

337
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:39,205
As some of you have noticed, during the gunfight when the police are actually firing at you,

338
00:16:39,205 --> 00:16:42,788
we cut out all the music and that was a conscious decision on our part.

339
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:47,152
because we had this mandate to make the gunfights feel impactful

340
00:16:47,152 --> 00:16:51,216
and feel, you know, important and be really, really, you know,

341
00:16:51,216 --> 00:16:53,338
something very important for watchdogs.

342
00:16:53,338 --> 00:16:57,221
So, you know, we watched a lot of Heat, Michael Mann's movie,

343
00:16:57,221 --> 00:16:59,884
and, you know, we dissected it and like, okay, so what makes this work?

344
00:16:59,884 --> 00:17:01,886
And we realized, you know, a lot of what made it work

345
00:17:01,886 --> 00:17:03,907
was that basically the guns were the music in those scenes.

346
00:17:03,907 --> 00:17:04,708
There was no actual...

347
00:17:05,089 --> 00:17:07,410
score on top of the big shootouts in heat.

348
00:17:07,410 --> 00:17:11,053
I said, well, you know, let's try that and try to bring up the guns and the bullet impacts

349
00:17:11,053 --> 00:17:13,114
and the pass-bys and everything once there's a gunfight.

350
00:17:13,114 --> 00:17:17,337
Also, it says, you know, the music goes away once the player is fired at

351
00:17:17,337 --> 00:17:21,180
because we also didn't want the player to be able to just shut off the music by shooting his gun in the air

352
00:17:21,180 --> 00:17:23,081
because that would have been a bit too obvious.

353
00:17:23,081 --> 00:17:25,583
So you have to be fired at, and then the music goes away,

354
00:17:25,583 --> 00:17:27,904
and then there's a countdown, there's a cool-down period,

355
00:17:27,904 --> 00:17:31,306
and if nobody shoots at you again, then the music will start back again.

356
00:17:32,910 --> 00:17:39,292
Our composer for Watch Dogs, whom we worked with first, was Brian Reitzel.

357
00:17:39,292 --> 00:17:43,954
And it was a really great experience. Brian worked on a lot of Sofia Coppola movies.

358
00:17:43,954 --> 00:17:44,834
He did the...

359
00:17:45,790 --> 00:17:54,701
Hannibal series he did boss set in Chicago as well. It was a great experience for us working with him. It was really interesting

360
00:17:54,701 --> 00:17:57,384
How we we came about working with him because when we started watch dogs

361
00:17:57,384 --> 00:17:59,767
We had this very clear vision of what we actually wanted

362
00:17:59,767 --> 00:18:04,373
It was like oh, it's gonna be very neat film noir music with a lot of brass and we were super

363
00:18:04,513 --> 00:18:08,875
excited about our direction and we sent out kind of a pitch request from

364
00:18:08,875 --> 00:18:13,657
composers and we got and it was so precise and we were so you know very

365
00:18:13,657 --> 00:18:17,619
determined about what we wanted and very precise but we what we wanted that what

366
00:18:17,619 --> 00:18:22,181
we got back was 20 times the same thing like ah yeah maybe that's maybe we did

367
00:18:22,181 --> 00:18:28,244
we give to precise the definitions of what we wanted so what basically we took

368
00:18:28,244 --> 00:18:31,986
those pitches and you know we there was a lot of good ones in there and we got

369
00:18:31,986 --> 00:18:33,667
that through our creative director and he said

370
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:36,169
we mean film more and that's what i want that i'm like okay

371
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:40,351
so it was a bit of a of a disconnect there between us and a creative director

372
00:18:40,351 --> 00:18:43,193
and so we decide we let's go with an ambient approach

373
00:18:43,193 --> 00:18:46,315
and more of a of a electronic approach and yet

374
00:18:46,315 --> 00:18:49,117
to watch dogs and we took a bunch of stuff from brian writes all

375
00:18:49,117 --> 00:18:51,959
and just you know put it to the images of the game

376
00:18:51,959 --> 00:18:55,061
this this works the sticks so you know we contacted him

377
00:18:55,061 --> 00:18:56,982
and that's how we start working together

378
00:18:56,982 --> 00:18:57,823
and uh...

379
00:18:58,163 --> 00:19:01,248
It was a fun experience, but since Wazhack was such a long project,

380
00:19:01,248 --> 00:19:04,453
obviously there was an evolving scope to the project.

381
00:19:04,453 --> 00:19:07,557
So what we decided that we were going to get from the beginning

382
00:19:07,557 --> 00:19:09,801
didn't necessarily fit the scope of the game in the end,

383
00:19:09,801 --> 00:19:13,426
and that's how we had to be a bit more creative down the line.

384
00:19:14,318 --> 00:19:16,981
and the final game needs often for the game

385
00:19:16,981 --> 00:19:18,643
as i explained earlier with the muse amiences

386
00:19:18,643 --> 00:19:22,486
uh... there were no need for that in the end but then once you've bought those

387
00:19:22,486 --> 00:19:24,709
things you kind of stuck with them and your budget has been spent so

388
00:19:24,709 --> 00:19:28,272
you know there was a lot of of good learnings for us in terms of you know

389
00:19:28,272 --> 00:19:30,755
how to deal with composers and and how to

390
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,277
when especially when to buy music from the composer

391
00:19:33,277 --> 00:19:37,821
uh... and uh... you know it was it was a lot of fun learning those lessons

392
00:19:38,142 --> 00:19:41,743
Here is, uh, Brian worked a lot on the cinematics, uh, for us.

393
00:19:41,743 --> 00:19:43,623
Uh, and he did a wonderful work,

394
00:19:43,623 --> 00:19:45,684
and this is my favorite cinematic for the game.

395
00:19:45,684 --> 00:19:49,645
So this is an example of Brian Weitzel's work on Watch Dogs,

396
00:19:49,645 --> 00:19:52,465
which I think really nails the emotional impact

397
00:19:52,465 --> 00:19:54,466
that music can have in the game

398
00:19:54,466 --> 00:19:57,487
with the very specific Watch Dogs flavor he set.

399
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,567
I followed you because I idolized you.

400
00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:04,068
Like Jackson does.

401
00:20:06,071 --> 00:20:09,692
And I kept hoping that you would meet around.

402
00:20:09,692 --> 00:20:15,334
Eventually, I just hoped that you would look back.

403
00:20:15,334 --> 00:20:24,917
All I can say is I'm sorry.

404
00:20:24,917 --> 00:20:33,379
But I'm not following you anymore.

405
00:20:36,061 --> 00:20:52,390
I know.

406
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:53,890
All right, sweetie.

407
00:20:53,890 --> 00:20:58,253
We're leaving now. Say goodbye to your Uncle Edie.

408
00:21:07,040 --> 00:21:08,663
Are you coming with us?

409
00:21:08,663 --> 00:21:08,863
No.

410
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:12,268
Your uncle's staying here.

411
00:21:12,268 --> 00:21:16,333
Bye, Jax.

412
00:21:32,693 --> 00:21:35,915
We got a lot of amazing stuff from this collaboration,

413
00:21:35,915 --> 00:21:39,037
and we're really grateful we got to work with Brian on this.

414
00:21:39,037 --> 00:21:41,838
And now it's Pavel's time to take over.

415
00:21:41,838 --> 00:21:43,059
Absolutely.

416
00:21:43,059 --> 00:21:45,460
So I would like to go a little bit more in-depth

417
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:47,401
on the technical side,

418
00:21:47,401 --> 00:21:49,783
a little bit more musical side of this thing.

419
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:54,505
So basically, the first time we got to work

420
00:21:54,505 --> 00:21:58,047
on the music concepts for Watch Dogs

421
00:21:58,047 --> 00:22:01,789
was around the first E3 we presented back in 2012.

422
00:22:02,570 --> 00:22:04,531
We got a lot of stuff from Brian.

423
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:08,272
It was all... actually, it fit perfectly.

424
00:22:08,272 --> 00:22:11,634
But as the demo progressed through the iterations,

425
00:22:11,634 --> 00:22:14,295
we noticed that there was some lack.

426
00:22:14,295 --> 00:22:18,497
In certain key moments, we lacked musical cues.

427
00:22:18,497 --> 00:22:21,078
So we decided to give it a shot,

428
00:22:21,078 --> 00:22:25,240
and the first, the really first integration of music

429
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:27,961
from our part into the Watch Dogs game

430
00:22:27,961 --> 00:22:29,141
was the club.

431
00:22:30,222 --> 00:22:31,903
seen in the E3 demo.

432
00:22:31,903 --> 00:22:36,446
So basically, Aiden had to go through the club,

433
00:22:36,446 --> 00:22:41,969
private club, and we needed music to be played in the club.

434
00:22:41,969 --> 00:22:44,511
So Olivier and Dave, our...

435
00:22:45,112 --> 00:22:49,374
audio artist, went through a lot of tracks, commercials and commercial tracks and everything,

436
00:22:49,374 --> 00:22:54,276
and nothing really fitted the mood we wanted to create.

437
00:22:54,276 --> 00:23:00,419
So at a certain point Dave said, well look, I can handle it, let's try it out.

438
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:05,001
So he composed the track, we put it in, and people loved it.

439
00:23:05,141 --> 00:23:08,642
It was kind of a stealth thing as well for a AAA Ubisoft game.

440
00:23:08,642 --> 00:23:10,263
It's not something we asked if we could do.

441
00:23:10,263 --> 00:23:11,783
We just, you know, like we were iterating,

442
00:23:11,783 --> 00:23:13,284
trying to find the proper track.

443
00:23:13,284 --> 00:23:15,765
But it wasn't something that we kind of did usually,

444
00:23:15,765 --> 00:23:18,886
you know, compose on the floor in-house.

445
00:23:18,886 --> 00:23:20,806
But eventually, we were just like, all right,

446
00:23:20,806 --> 00:23:22,227
you know, this really works.

447
00:23:22,227 --> 00:23:24,388
But we never really said where it was coming from.

448
00:23:24,388 --> 00:23:25,088
We just put it in.

449
00:23:25,088 --> 00:23:26,068
And then once we got the, you know,

450
00:23:26,068 --> 00:23:29,409
very good reaction from E3, and then I, as a producer,

451
00:23:29,409 --> 00:23:30,650
said, what does editorial think?

452
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:31,910
And all I said, oh, they really like it.

453
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:32,410
I was like, oh.

454
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:38,133
Well, that got us thinking about what opportunities this was opening up for us.

455
00:23:38,133 --> 00:23:41,635
Absolutely. And people loved it on YouTube. They made remixes of that track.

456
00:23:41,635 --> 00:23:45,177
So we said, all right, we might be onto something.

457
00:23:45,177 --> 00:23:50,340
So since we wanted to be really precise about the musical intentions,

458
00:23:50,340 --> 00:23:52,941
the integration of music in Watch Dogs,

459
00:23:52,941 --> 00:23:55,703
that fitted our kind of musical ambitions because...

460
00:23:56,363 --> 00:24:01,266
We want to tailor, make music for very specific moments to work within the systems.

461
00:24:01,266 --> 00:24:03,788
We're tightly scripted for the missions.

462
00:24:03,788 --> 00:24:11,773
And since we work with people in the engine and tools and animation everywhere,

463
00:24:11,773 --> 00:24:15,575
we know how things are hooked up in the game, so for us it was much easier to...

464
00:24:16,215 --> 00:24:20,879
to just be part of the team and iterate with the team

465
00:24:20,879 --> 00:24:22,580
as the team made progress, we were right there.

466
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:25,483
So that added tremendous flexibility on our part.

467
00:24:25,483 --> 00:24:28,024
So, I mean, we knew up front what was coming

468
00:24:28,024 --> 00:24:29,526
in the next version of the demo.

469
00:24:29,526 --> 00:24:30,026
Uh...sorry.

470
00:24:30,026 --> 00:24:35,810
Let me go right there.

471
00:24:35,810 --> 00:24:38,172
So for the in-house production,

472
00:24:38,172 --> 00:24:39,774
we were working with three people.

473
00:24:39,774 --> 00:24:41,955
They were Dave Christian...

474
00:24:42,763 --> 00:24:47,235
The gentleman on your right, Peter Connolly on the bottom and myself.

475
00:24:50,813 --> 00:24:55,658
Three of us, we have really different musical backgrounds and history.

476
00:24:55,658 --> 00:25:01,444
So Dave is a mostly film composer and electronic musician for the past 25 years.

477
00:25:01,444 --> 00:25:07,890
Peter Connell is a hard gun. He's very versatile. He can do almost everything.

478
00:25:07,890 --> 00:25:12,955
And I'm mostly rooted in rock and jazz, a little bit of classical music also.

479
00:25:12,955 --> 00:25:14,937
So with those flavors, we...

480
00:25:15,738 --> 00:25:20,961
always trying to mix and match because Brian Reitzel gave us the first kind of vision of what

481
00:25:20,961 --> 00:25:29,987
Watch Dogs should be and then we kind of followed his lead but bringing our own background and

482
00:25:29,987 --> 00:25:35,190
I think what it provided us because we wrote a lot of music for the Watch Dogs.

483
00:25:35,190 --> 00:25:36,811
I mean with the DLC we up to

484
00:25:37,877 --> 00:25:40,658
I think four or four hours of in-house composed music.

485
00:25:40,658 --> 00:25:43,540
We wanted to be so close to the actual mission.

486
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:45,521
Sometimes we were so close to the mission,

487
00:25:45,521 --> 00:25:48,903
once that mission was done, we couldn't necessarily reuse that track for anything else.

488
00:25:48,903 --> 00:25:51,105
So we had to make custom-made tracks for a lot of the missions.

489
00:25:51,105 --> 00:25:54,207
Always, yeah. And we wanted that. I mean, it wasn't constrained, basically.

490
00:25:54,747 --> 00:26:01,796
So we, me and Dave, we work with the sonar in our mixing studio, little mixing studios.

491
00:26:01,796 --> 00:26:05,300
And we brought in our own musical instruments.

492
00:26:05,300 --> 00:26:08,204
You know, Dave works with the modular synths.

493
00:26:08,204 --> 00:26:12,169
I work mostly with guitar and amplifiers and effects.

494
00:26:12,865 --> 00:26:16,726
And it gave us really a more diverse approach.

495
00:26:16,726 --> 00:26:18,947
So instead of being redundant, we always kind of

496
00:26:18,947 --> 00:26:22,228
spiced it up a little bit with different things.

497
00:26:22,228 --> 00:26:25,089
This is how we can schematically represent

498
00:26:25,089 --> 00:26:28,270
how we treated the music, interactive music,

499
00:26:28,270 --> 00:26:28,990
in Watch Dogs.

500
00:26:28,990 --> 00:26:31,431
So basically, going from left to right,

501
00:26:31,431 --> 00:26:35,332
you can see we subdivided always in musical measures,

502
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,693
basically, in bars.

503
00:26:36,693 --> 00:26:39,774
So we got always starting with the intro.

504
00:26:40,614 --> 00:26:42,636
Usually four bars, skipping to four bars.

505
00:26:42,636 --> 00:26:44,857
And then we've got a little F1 thing.

506
00:26:44,857 --> 00:26:47,339
This is what we call the filler.

507
00:26:47,339 --> 00:26:49,700
So a filler is basically a really short.

508
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:55,026
musical idea. It could be rhythmic, it could be melodic, but it has to be really short, one bar or less.

509
00:26:55,026 --> 00:26:59,651
What it was supposed to achieve is that

510
00:26:59,651 --> 00:27:05,777
you will go through intro one into intro two, a little development, and then it will loop on the filler one

511
00:27:05,777 --> 00:27:10,581
waiting for a trigger from inside the game to be sent to the musical engine.

512
00:27:10,581 --> 00:27:14,045
So basically, since it was so short and looping so fast upon itself,

513
00:27:14,746 --> 00:27:20,794
we can trigger something really fast, and there will be almost no lag between the event that was sent from the game engine

514
00:27:20,794 --> 00:27:24,319
and the music reacting, switching to the main thing.

515
00:27:24,319 --> 00:27:28,966
Then again, four bars, let's say, for the first main pass.

516
00:27:29,767 --> 00:27:37,891
going into M2, M3, M4, and M5, which are shorter sections of the main one with little development,

517
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:43,973
perhaps. And that allows to be, again, to be responsive from the input from the game engine.

518
00:27:43,973 --> 00:27:49,095
If the player accomplishes something, boom, we can chop at, let's say, M3 and skip to

519
00:27:49,095 --> 00:27:53,837
main six right away without going through M4 and M5. And also, it's much more reactive.

520
00:27:54,397 --> 00:27:59,240
And then usually we had after the whole main six, which is usually a big development with themes,

521
00:27:59,240 --> 00:28:04,944
so we didn't want to cut it up so we can proceed with a more melodic development.

522
00:28:04,944 --> 00:28:09,627
Then we will go into filler two and wait for the outro, usually a little punch or

523
00:28:09,627 --> 00:28:13,089
cinematic or something like that. So this is in a nutshell how it works.

524
00:28:15,436 --> 00:28:15,737
uh...

525
00:28:15,737 --> 00:28:20,802
yes so uh... the uh... the main consideration my part was uh...

526
00:28:20,802 --> 00:28:22,964
established themes the main characters

527
00:28:22,964 --> 00:28:25,386
in what dogs this is

528
00:28:25,386 --> 00:28:27,308
things i prefer to do because

529
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:30,111
i mean it raises an identity to the game people can

530
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:30,751
recognize

531
00:28:30,751 --> 00:28:34,755
uh... the the characters by the teams and it creates a lot of

532
00:28:34,895 --> 00:28:40,318
interesting small ideas you can reuse elsewhere in the game and create identity because over four hours of music

533
00:28:40,318 --> 00:28:46,320
I mean I personally want to create a dent so if a person randomly listens to whatever track on the internet

534
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:52,043
And so oh this is I heard in watchdog, and this is this is was my goal, so this is the really

535
00:28:52,043 --> 00:28:53,143
small

536
00:28:53,143 --> 00:28:57,605
Redux of the main theme for Aiden slash watchdogs

537
00:28:57,605 --> 00:29:01,847
This is only an example on the example on the piano solo

538
00:29:16,690 --> 00:29:20,492
It's real simple stuff, and so it could be easily reusable.

539
00:29:20,492 --> 00:29:23,953
But I will speak about it a little later.

540
00:29:23,953 --> 00:29:28,294
Here's a development of that theme a bit more fleshed out.

541
00:29:28,294 --> 00:29:31,775
This is from DLC, so we incorporated DLC theme

542
00:29:31,775 --> 00:29:32,815
in it, mixing them together.

543
00:29:32,815 --> 00:29:34,056
So it's kind of.

544
00:29:34,676 --> 00:29:37,742
It's always useful to have themes in game, I think.

545
00:30:26,008 --> 00:30:27,949
I switch it to there.

546
00:31:25,063 --> 00:31:25,583
All right.

547
00:31:25,583 --> 00:31:30,885
So this is one of the aspects of themes we use, melodical themes.

548
00:31:30,885 --> 00:31:37,107
Also, I think always in the thematical approach, usage of clear instruments associated to each

549
00:31:37,107 --> 00:31:40,068
character, this is my approach.

550
00:31:40,068 --> 00:31:46,350
For Clara, which is the sidekick of Aiden throughout the game, I wrote a little theme

551
00:31:46,350 --> 00:31:48,071
for her with the usage of clarinet.

552
00:31:48,711 --> 00:31:52,614
But since the Watchdog is all about hacking

553
00:31:52,614 --> 00:31:54,715
and digital error and glitch and all that,

554
00:31:54,715 --> 00:31:57,597
so I tried real little things.

555
00:31:57,597 --> 00:32:00,459
I just processed the clarinet

556
00:32:00,459 --> 00:32:04,021
to make it a little bit more aggressive

557
00:32:04,021 --> 00:32:05,742
and a little bit more distorted.

558
00:32:05,742 --> 00:32:06,703
So here's how it sounds.

559
00:32:06,703 --> 00:32:10,646
This is the regular clarinet.

560
00:32:19,867 --> 00:32:22,288
And here's the treated version.

561
00:32:35,737 --> 00:32:38,757
So there's a little distortion, a little delay,

562
00:32:38,757 --> 00:32:41,238
and it sometimes, since the delay catches the distortion,

563
00:32:41,238 --> 00:32:44,939
kind of clashes with the following notes.

564
00:32:44,939 --> 00:32:46,600
It's a real supple trick.

565
00:32:46,600 --> 00:32:49,061
Also, within the range of the recognizable sounds,

566
00:32:49,061 --> 00:32:52,622
we used a lot of synths, of course, since it's Watch Dogs.

567
00:32:52,622 --> 00:32:55,342
And one of the main patches we used was this one,

568
00:32:55,342 --> 00:32:59,644
which we used throughout the main game and the DLC.

569
00:32:59,644 --> 00:33:00,604
It sounds like this.

570
00:33:02,646 --> 00:33:17,521
So it's really, I like that patch a lot because it creates a rhythmical movement right away,

571
00:33:17,521 --> 00:33:20,584
plus it sounds really dystopian kind of.

572
00:33:21,907 --> 00:33:28,029
There's a small example of all that coming together in one of the scenes in the early scene of the game where you actually get to meet Clara.

573
00:33:28,029 --> 00:33:35,373
So you're going to hear a bit of everything and it's, we tried to tag what was going on at the top of the screen,

574
00:33:35,373 --> 00:33:48,458
but basically it's just all these techniques coming together in this small clip.

575
00:33:58,070 --> 00:33:58,550
You don't look 17.

576
00:33:58,550 --> 00:34:01,171
Do I look like a bad boy?

577
00:34:01,171 --> 00:34:03,592
No, you look like a wild card.

578
00:34:03,592 --> 00:34:07,354
I hope I don't frighten you.

579
00:34:07,354 --> 00:34:12,476
What, do you have a reason to frighten me?

580
00:34:12,476 --> 00:34:14,817
Now you're being paranoid.

581
00:34:14,817 --> 00:34:15,117
Am I?

582
00:34:15,117 --> 00:34:18,399
Someone is fucking with my life.

583
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:21,640
Threatening my family and at the same moment

584
00:34:21,640 --> 00:34:22,401
the mysterious bad boy wants to meet me

585
00:34:22,401 --> 00:34:22,681
and he is a she.

586
00:34:22,681 --> 00:34:23,001
He is a lie.

587
00:34:23,001 --> 00:34:23,241
Listen.

588
00:34:23,241 --> 00:34:26,002
I need to trust you.

589
00:34:28,091 --> 00:34:29,931
I wouldn't trust me if I were you.

590
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,332
But here's a reason to listen.

591
00:34:31,332 --> 00:34:35,893
The text message you sent me?

592
00:34:35,893 --> 00:34:37,633
I know where to find him.

593
00:34:37,633 --> 00:34:41,354
Yeah. Well, we don't need to meet face to face for that.

594
00:34:41,354 --> 00:34:41,574
No.

595
00:34:41,574 --> 00:34:44,934
We needed a face to face for this.

596
00:34:44,934 --> 00:34:47,895
By the way, this wasn't the final mix of the game.

597
00:34:47,895 --> 00:34:49,895
When we were preparing these clips,

598
00:34:49,895 --> 00:34:52,176
we did a version with the music mixed up just a bit

599
00:34:52,176 --> 00:34:54,656
so it would become more clear when we were presenting them.

600
00:34:54,656 --> 00:34:55,497
Absolutely, yes.

601
00:34:56,287 --> 00:35:04,814
Another thing I'm really fond of is to bring new stuff in the soundtrack, something nobody

602
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:05,774
else can have, right?

603
00:35:05,774 --> 00:35:09,217
Something really unique to the project.

604
00:35:09,217 --> 00:35:15,782
I'm really a do-it-yourself guy, so a couple of years ago I built a guitar which looks

605
00:35:15,782 --> 00:35:16,242
like this.

606
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:20,165
Oops, sorry.

607
00:35:20,165 --> 00:35:23,266
It's a fretless, a real technical mishap,

608
00:35:23,266 --> 00:35:26,047
it's a fretless baritone guitar.

609
00:35:26,047 --> 00:35:28,048
I was saving it for a little special project

610
00:35:28,048 --> 00:35:30,569
and Watch Dogs was the one, so it's kind of,

611
00:35:30,569 --> 00:35:33,970
it's a guitar, but I mean, when you hear it,

612
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,811
it creates a really specific palette of sounds and it's.

613
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:39,823
It's a very nice, useful tool to have,

614
00:35:39,823 --> 00:35:41,546
and it creates a musical imprint,

615
00:35:41,546 --> 00:35:43,009
something you can easily recognize

616
00:35:43,009 --> 00:35:44,912
as being part of Watch Dogs, again,

617
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,856
being part of the hacking and all that.

618
00:35:46,856 --> 00:35:49,340
So this is an example of that guitar being used.

619
00:36:23,355 --> 00:36:39,400
And another example from Bad Blood, which is the DLC for the game.

620
00:37:21,178 --> 00:37:28,102
But of course, all that is nice, but when you have to compose for an interactive project or an interactive music system,

621
00:37:28,102 --> 00:37:31,384
you always have to be composing with constraints within constraints.

622
00:37:31,384 --> 00:37:36,687
And I really like to approach composing backwards, kind of.

623
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,549
So I start with the main thing, with the main theme.

624
00:37:40,917 --> 00:37:46,039
and incorporate it into the game and see how it fits, what are the main challenges, what could cut it,

625
00:37:46,039 --> 00:37:51,541
what, basically, what's the worst that could happen within the usage of that music.

626
00:37:51,541 --> 00:37:52,682
And then I try to compose the...

627
00:37:52,682 --> 00:37:58,084
So I start with the main thing and go back to the intro or to the ending,

628
00:37:58,084 --> 00:38:00,425
and starting with, like, with the main course.

629
00:38:00,425 --> 00:38:04,667
So it helps a lot to really tailor-mate the music,

630
00:38:04,667 --> 00:38:08,669
so basically you know how many bars you will need to fill that gap and all that, you know, so...

631
00:38:09,204 --> 00:38:10,425
It really helps a lot.

632
00:38:10,425 --> 00:38:12,686
Another little trick I would like to share with you,

633
00:38:12,686 --> 00:38:14,387
this is personal observation,

634
00:38:14,387 --> 00:38:17,668
is the, for me, it's the, what I call the piano validation,

635
00:38:17,668 --> 00:38:20,309
is, uh, me as a guitarist,

636
00:38:20,309 --> 00:38:23,591
I mean, I always try to compose the guitars and all that,

637
00:38:23,591 --> 00:38:25,252
but, you know, sometimes you find that cool riff

638
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:28,273
that really sounds amazing with the distortion and effects,

639
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,974
and you're really grooving and all that,

640
00:38:30,974 --> 00:38:33,956
and then you try to establish more of the harmonic content,

641
00:38:33,956 --> 00:38:34,736
and you sort of...

642
00:38:35,497 --> 00:38:40,539
and you notice that your riff is really charged and it's too many things going on at the same time

643
00:38:40,539 --> 00:38:43,780
and you kind of find yourself squeezed and you kind of abandon the idea.

644
00:38:43,780 --> 00:38:49,283
So what I really like to do is to find whatever riff on the synth sequence or guitar or whatever

645
00:38:49,283 --> 00:38:52,204
and then reproduce it on the piano.

646
00:38:52,204 --> 00:38:54,505
Clean piano sound and see if it works.

647
00:38:54,505 --> 00:38:55,465
If it works, I can proceed.

648
00:38:55,465 --> 00:38:59,687
I know that harmonically it will be stable and I couldn't elaborate on that,

649
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,728
but it's really just...

650
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,724
Bring in to the simplest expression of the music through the piano and see if it works

651
00:39:07,724 --> 00:39:15,029
And if it does you can proceed it will avoid a lot of death traps from the music point of view

652
00:39:15,029 --> 00:39:21,453
Yeah, so going a little bit more a little deeper into the harmony aspect of watchdogs production

653
00:39:22,053 --> 00:39:24,534
Here's the few examples I prepared for you.

654
00:39:24,534 --> 00:39:27,655
So the first example, and the example,

655
00:39:27,655 --> 00:39:30,376
the first point is being, keeping the harmony

656
00:39:30,376 --> 00:39:31,256
really simple.

657
00:39:31,256 --> 00:39:34,056
This is, I cannot stress it enough.

658
00:39:34,056 --> 00:39:35,317
Well, this is for my behalf.

659
00:39:35,317 --> 00:39:39,718
I think it works better, especially within the watchdogs.

660
00:39:39,718 --> 00:39:42,719
And here's the example itself.

661
00:39:42,719 --> 00:39:44,099
This is the watchdog theme.

662
00:39:44,859 --> 00:39:48,821
A little bit of a performance going on here so we can really

663
00:39:48,821 --> 00:39:51,723
stretch out how it works.

664
00:39:51,723 --> 00:39:53,964
And I was going to take you through it.

665
00:39:53,964 --> 00:39:54,445
Yeah.

666
00:39:54,445 --> 00:40:01,989
So here's the core, right, for the progression.

667
00:40:01,989 --> 00:40:03,030
It goes through.

668
00:40:03,493 --> 00:40:10,096
starts well another thing while I'm at it is the for the whole watchdogs I always

669
00:40:10,096 --> 00:40:17,499
tried to keep everything in the same key so we chose C minor as the key dominant

670
00:40:17,499 --> 00:40:20,640
key for the whole game and there's a lot of advantages

671
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:22,561
It's really simple.

672
00:40:22,561 --> 00:40:27,924
And the main advantage is that you can mix and match different systems and they all will

673
00:40:27,924 --> 00:40:29,565
kind of fall within themselves.

674
00:40:29,565 --> 00:40:34,768
Because right, you start, let's say, a vigilante event in the game, then suddenly something

675
00:40:34,768 --> 00:40:36,829
else happens in the systemic world.

676
00:40:36,829 --> 00:40:37,670
Boom!

677
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,270
You have, you trigger a felony.

678
00:40:39,270 --> 00:40:40,691
But if your musical cues...

679
00:40:41,534 --> 00:40:44,316
are in the same key, the transition will be much smoother

680
00:40:44,316 --> 00:40:46,498
through, through, it's kind of really basic,

681
00:40:46,498 --> 00:40:48,519
but I wanted to stress it out.

682
00:40:48,519 --> 00:40:51,121
So back to the Watch Dogs theme.

683
00:40:51,121 --> 00:40:53,563
It really goes like, right?

684
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:54,084
C minor.

685
00:40:54,084 --> 00:40:58,667
Back to A minor.

686
00:40:58,667 --> 00:41:01,870
This little trick, progression thirds, minor thirds.

687
00:41:04,972 --> 00:41:06,554
is reused throughout the game.

688
00:41:06,554 --> 00:41:08,695
I mean, every cue almost that I did

689
00:41:08,695 --> 00:41:11,458
had this incorporated in some way.

690
00:41:11,458 --> 00:41:13,059
Because I think it's one again,

691
00:41:13,059 --> 00:41:15,641
we're going back to the theme approach for the game.

692
00:41:15,641 --> 00:41:17,663
And I think it's really part of it.

693
00:41:17,663 --> 00:41:18,763
And this creates a kind of

694
00:41:18,763 --> 00:41:22,987
mysterious sound a little bit.

695
00:41:22,987 --> 00:41:24,668
You don't know what to expect

696
00:41:24,668 --> 00:41:25,869
because it's two minor chords,

697
00:41:25,869 --> 00:41:27,731
not really related tonally.

698
00:41:27,731 --> 00:41:29,192
And it goes both ways.

699
00:41:29,192 --> 00:41:33,135
You can go lower

700
00:41:33,135 --> 00:41:33,375
or sharper.

701
00:41:33,795 --> 00:41:40,857
So, let me play this little example for you.

702
00:42:02,971 --> 00:42:03,555
you

703
00:42:23,965 --> 00:42:29,387
So while it's playing, you can always add, of course you will need to, to add a little

704
00:42:29,387 --> 00:42:32,828
bass to that thing, because it's only the...

705
00:42:32,828 --> 00:42:36,008
So you can stay in C, right?

706
00:42:36,008 --> 00:42:41,250
For the whole progression.

707
00:42:41,250 --> 00:42:51,612
But I prefer to follow the progression through the root, but I will explain both examples.

708
00:42:54,853 --> 00:43:03,002
Thank you for watching my video.

709
00:43:11,120 --> 00:43:15,863
Thanks for watching!

710
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:43,088
So now we have the bass and the rhythm going on, and I will add up for the next playthrough,

711
00:43:43,088 --> 00:43:54,114
I will add up the melody, so we can hear how it all blends together.

712
00:44:02,733 --> 00:44:15,856
Thank you for watching!

713
00:44:37,189 --> 00:44:41,731
And there you go, right there. This is the melody for the whole main theme.

714
00:44:41,731 --> 00:44:42,411
Part of the time.

715
00:44:42,411 --> 00:44:42,751
Thank you.

716
00:44:42,751 --> 00:44:48,853
It's really basic stuff. You see, we always repeat the same almost four notes.

717
00:44:48,853 --> 00:44:50,994
Three notes.

718
00:44:50,994 --> 00:44:56,856
This is a part of the main theme, which is...

719
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:02,561
that little A flat in there.

720
00:45:02,561 --> 00:45:05,661
But since the melody and the theme is so simple,

721
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:07,342
it's really primitive.

722
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:11,463
But while it's being so simple, it's really versatile.

723
00:45:11,463 --> 00:45:12,803
You can reuse it everywhere.

724
00:45:12,803 --> 00:45:15,863
Reuse it through different harmonies, different keys,

725
00:45:15,863 --> 00:45:16,644
mix and match notes.

726
00:45:16,644 --> 00:45:18,504
It's really, really fluent.

727
00:45:18,504 --> 00:45:20,284
And since it's short, you can reuse it

728
00:45:20,284 --> 00:45:22,905
within the context of the interactive music.

729
00:45:22,905 --> 00:45:25,225
So it's recognizable, short, and reusable.

730
00:45:25,225 --> 00:45:27,766
I mean, you've got everything in there.

731
00:45:28,797 --> 00:45:32,600
Here's another example, what I call the borrowed chords

732
00:45:32,600 --> 00:45:33,381
or model interchange.

733
00:45:33,381 --> 00:45:36,064
This is the Clara theme.

734
00:45:36,064 --> 00:45:40,547
Again, real simple, four chords, nothing more.

735
00:45:40,547 --> 00:45:42,990
See again, this little example I told you about,

736
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:44,171
the C minor.

737
00:45:44,171 --> 00:45:46,933
Going to E flat minor.

738
00:45:46,933 --> 00:45:48,975
Kind of a little.

739
00:45:48,975 --> 00:45:53,459
Let me play it out, this one for you,

740
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:56,021
so you can kind of relate to what it says.

741
00:46:06,329 --> 00:46:20,642
Three chords, let's outline them with bass.

742
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:44,504
Again you can stay on the C root note through the whole thing if you want

743
00:46:44,504 --> 00:46:56,007
But I prefer to follow it once again with the root notes

744
00:47:01,576 --> 00:47:15,219
As you can see, there's a little model thing going on, there's a lot of chords that are

745
00:47:15,219 --> 00:47:24,520
not part of the C minor, the flat minor, nor the F major, are not part of the... actually

746
00:47:24,520 --> 00:47:27,341
the F major could be, but...

747
00:47:27,341 --> 00:47:30,762
Now let's hear the melody.

748
00:47:46,740 --> 00:47:52,286
So while being extremely simple, this melody, again, is very repeatable.

749
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:59,394
I mean, it is easily integrable into other themes and it is interchangeable.

750
00:47:59,394 --> 00:48:00,535
There's a few little tricks.

751
00:48:00,535 --> 00:48:04,260
I prefer when I change chords like this from going, let's say, from...

752
00:48:05,581 --> 00:48:06,642
C to E flat to F.

753
00:48:06,642 --> 00:48:09,644
I prefer to highlight the most,

754
00:48:09,644 --> 00:48:10,965
well, a little jazz approach, you know,

755
00:48:10,965 --> 00:48:14,548
I mean, you can highlight the most important notes

756
00:48:14,548 --> 00:48:15,929
of that chord you play in a puff.

757
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:17,611
So basically, you know, in this case,

758
00:48:17,611 --> 00:48:18,892
you know, you're going like,

759
00:48:18,892 --> 00:48:21,934
let's start at measure one.

760
00:48:21,934 --> 00:48:27,699
You're going to the root of the E flat

761
00:48:27,699 --> 00:48:30,762
and, you know, a little diminished passive.

762
00:48:30,762 --> 00:48:33,704
Then to go on the F chord.

763
00:48:34,705 --> 00:48:36,586
It could be...

764
00:48:36,586 --> 00:48:40,728
This is straight, the notes from the triad of the F chord.

765
00:48:40,728 --> 00:48:44,289
And we're going to C minor again, so it's real simple.

766
00:48:44,289 --> 00:48:50,252
The chord inversions, another real fast example.

767
00:48:50,252 --> 00:48:52,673
Here's another really simple progression.

768
00:48:52,673 --> 00:48:56,434
Again, you will recognize that sound, you know.

769
00:48:56,434 --> 00:49:00,456
C minor to A minor.

770
00:49:00,456 --> 00:49:03,057
Going to F minor.

771
00:49:04,938 --> 00:49:05,619
Fsus4.

772
00:49:05,619 --> 00:49:09,621
What it gives us, you see the bottom line

773
00:49:09,621 --> 00:49:11,202
is always a straight C.

774
00:49:11,202 --> 00:49:14,104
So it goes like, let's do a little example of that.

775
00:49:14,104 --> 00:49:14,585
Excuse me.

776
00:49:14,585 --> 00:49:17,026
♪ Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,

777
00:49:17,026 --> 00:49:21,889
♪ Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk,

778
00:49:37,457 --> 00:49:42,345
So we create a little bassline, let's say this is a synth arpeggio or whatever, you

779
00:49:42,345 --> 00:49:48,535
know, it could, it stays in C, it plays throughout the whole song, for the whole duration of

780
00:49:48,535 --> 00:49:49,437
the song, right?

781
00:49:50,017 --> 00:49:55,219
Since we're using the chord inversions in this example, so we're always keeping the

782
00:49:55,219 --> 00:50:01,060
C note on the bottom in the root position of the chords, you can reuse any one of those

783
00:50:01,060 --> 00:50:05,922
chords in an interchangeable manner and it will kind of flow, still flow nicely in all

784
00:50:05,922 --> 00:50:10,103
that C.

785
00:50:10,103 --> 00:50:14,144
I can switch chords.

786
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,665
Let's go, let's start with A minor.

787
00:50:18,190 --> 00:50:21,572
Go on to F.

788
00:50:21,572 --> 00:50:24,033
Etc, etc.

789
00:50:24,033 --> 00:50:31,918
You can do whatever with those chords and it will kind of still be acceptable to the

790
00:50:31,918 --> 00:50:33,078
human ear.

791
00:50:33,078 --> 00:50:34,779
But, then again, this is Watch Dogs.

792
00:50:34,779 --> 00:50:40,903
I mean, the game is all about hacking, the game is all about the glitchiness, so I kind

793
00:50:40,903 --> 00:50:42,304
of tried to integrate the...

794
00:50:43,077 --> 00:50:46,639
the theme of glitch into the harmony itself.

795
00:50:46,639 --> 00:50:50,081
So sometimes, you know, I mean, the changes we play through,

796
00:50:50,081 --> 00:50:53,963
they're not really, let's see, it's not top 40 material,

797
00:50:53,963 --> 00:50:57,345
right, but I mean, within the, if you...

798
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:04,330
If you use them a lot through the whole soundtrack, the player's ears get used to it.

799
00:51:04,330 --> 00:51:09,315
And when sudden changes arrive, I mean something you didn't expect arrives,

800
00:51:09,315 --> 00:51:18,043
it will not surprise the player as much because he's already kind of used to the sharp and ambiguous quality of those chords.

801
00:51:18,524 --> 00:51:23,685
Then we have to move on soon to the music licensing aspect all right that we're really speeding through this

802
00:51:23,685 --> 00:51:25,605
There's there's not much time left. I hear

803
00:51:25,605 --> 00:51:25,785
my bad

804
00:51:25,785 --> 00:51:29,526
So we basically use the odd time signatures

805
00:51:29,526 --> 00:51:35,887
Through game also to create that sense of instability again. I can approach

806
00:51:35,887 --> 00:51:45,669
Here's a blue example. I won't play the whole thing for you, but

807
00:51:49,975 --> 00:51:51,101
You

808
00:52:13,442 --> 00:52:19,453
Odd number of matters per musical phrase is another trick we used.

809
00:52:20,581 --> 00:52:24,164
is balance the musical straightness of the whole thing, right?

810
00:52:24,164 --> 00:52:28,167
So basically when the player is used to the subdivisions of four measures,

811
00:52:28,167 --> 00:52:32,370
we kind of mix it up, make five measure progressions, seven measure progression,

812
00:52:32,370 --> 00:52:33,992
just to mix little things a little bit.

813
00:52:33,992 --> 00:52:36,834
So again, when the changes, sudden changes arrive,

814
00:52:36,834 --> 00:52:39,356
people are already used to that kind of feel.

815
00:52:39,356 --> 00:52:41,458
Common notes throughout progression,

816
00:52:41,458 --> 00:52:43,640
we will quickly see those chords again.

817
00:52:44,761 --> 00:52:49,586
usage of the minor, C minor back to E minor again,

818
00:52:49,586 --> 00:52:52,048
with transition through B major.

819
00:52:52,048 --> 00:52:54,351
I always love to arrange the chords,

820
00:52:54,351 --> 00:52:57,654
so we always keep one common note throughout progression.

821
00:52:57,654 --> 00:52:59,256
In this case, it's an E flat.

822
00:53:00,137 --> 00:53:06,724
And by keeping that E flat throughout chords, I mean you can launch a melodic phrase

823
00:53:06,724 --> 00:53:10,329
Let's say the musical theme for Aiden or Watchdogs

824
00:53:10,329 --> 00:53:16,015
And it will work right on top of any of those chords without any

825
00:53:16,015 --> 00:53:18,278
constraints

826
00:53:20,588 --> 00:53:25,130
Here's a, we're gonna have a very quickly an example of in-game music integration where

827
00:53:25,130 --> 00:53:27,470
we try to blend all the systems in.

828
00:53:27,470 --> 00:53:30,971
So basically in this mission you're about to see there's a bit of editing going on as

829
00:53:30,971 --> 00:53:32,772
well so for brevity's sake.

830
00:53:32,772 --> 00:53:36,953
But what's going on is we go from diegetic music coming from the club which blends into

831
00:53:36,953 --> 00:53:40,694
music inside the club and then it becomes composed music.

832
00:53:41,454 --> 00:53:45,236
that's been made to sound like it's from the club and then it escalates into a mission music.

833
00:53:45,236 --> 00:53:46,756
So you'll see the example here.

834
00:53:46,756 --> 00:53:49,958
And this is the type of things we did to try to blend all the systems together

835
00:53:49,958 --> 00:53:51,658
and try to reconcile everything in the world.

836
00:53:51,658 --> 00:53:54,880
And we're pretty happy how it turned out for this particular mission.

837
00:53:54,880 --> 00:54:06,045
The music here is coming from outside.

838
00:54:06,045 --> 00:54:10,726
Now there's a different perspective as you're in the lobby.

839
00:54:11,726 --> 00:54:15,487
I'm going to have you listen to me.

840
00:54:15,487 --> 00:54:20,208
I am default. Welcome to my party.

841
00:54:20,208 --> 00:54:23,749
Damn, he's good.

842
00:54:23,749 --> 00:54:32,711
Look at that, he's hacked into the profiler system.

843
00:54:32,711 --> 00:54:35,772
He's totally with me.

844
00:55:22,158 --> 00:55:24,779
We've got some club music and full-on score right now.

845
00:55:40,913 --> 00:55:42,594
And eventually, through that mission,

846
00:55:42,594 --> 00:55:43,635
the music then becomes even more.

847
00:55:43,635 --> 00:55:45,115
There's even more parts of that music

848
00:55:45,115 --> 00:55:46,416
coming on down the line.

849
00:55:46,416 --> 00:55:47,356
When it works well, you know,

850
00:55:47,356 --> 00:55:48,557
we didn't invent anything there,

851
00:55:48,557 --> 00:55:49,257
but when it works well,

852
00:55:49,257 --> 00:55:50,998
and we can blend all our systems together,

853
00:55:50,998 --> 00:55:52,539
then it really elevates those missions

854
00:55:52,539 --> 00:55:53,999
to a higher level,

855
00:55:53,999 --> 00:55:55,540
and we're really happy doing that.

856
00:55:55,540 --> 00:55:57,000
And we did that a few other times.

857
00:55:57,000 --> 00:55:58,441
I'm gonna skip one example here we had,

858
00:55:58,441 --> 00:56:00,082
which was basically the same idea,

859
00:56:00,082 --> 00:56:01,863
where actually diagecting music

860
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:03,343
coming from somewhere in the mission

861
00:56:03,343 --> 00:56:04,944
and then becomes the score music

862
00:56:04,944 --> 00:56:06,004
for that specific mission.

863
00:56:06,004 --> 00:56:07,485
We had a Wu-Tang Clan mission.

864
00:56:08,125 --> 00:56:11,307
and that we called it, that had the Wu-Tang Clan song in it

865
00:56:11,307 --> 00:56:13,188
that we really liked how it turned out.

866
00:56:13,188 --> 00:56:15,089
We had another one in a junkyard with Ministry playing

867
00:56:15,089 --> 00:56:17,330
through the speakers, which was really cool as well.

868
00:56:17,330 --> 00:56:19,771
And I want to touch a bit on music licensing

869
00:56:19,771 --> 00:56:22,232
just before we're done, because that was a big one for us.

870
00:56:22,232 --> 00:56:24,533
It was the first time we had to do that to such an extent

871
00:56:24,533 --> 00:56:26,634
in a game and try to get all that music in.

872
00:56:26,634 --> 00:56:28,115
And, uh, it...

873
00:56:28,675 --> 00:56:37,039
We, when we started thinking about licensed music, we thought about all the open world games, what they were doing, and you know, the first answer to that is, oh, well, they're doing radios.

874
00:56:37,039 --> 00:56:45,142
And I'm like, well, you know, radios have been done, and the Watch Dogs flavor is not about radios. It was about your, you know, your telephone, your PDA, what you've got in your pocket.

875
00:56:45,142 --> 00:56:52,246
And we figured, you know, that's how I listen to music in my car. It's my playlist, and we figured we're going to do a playlist for the player that he's able to fill out.

876
00:56:52,726 --> 00:56:54,667
as he progresses through the game.

877
00:56:54,667 --> 00:56:58,109
But our angle on it was that we wanted to be meaningful as well.

878
00:56:58,109 --> 00:57:01,410
We wanted to be sure that that playlist had something to say about the game.

879
00:57:01,410 --> 00:57:04,172
And since Chicago was such a big part of Watch Dogs,

880
00:57:04,172 --> 00:57:07,873
we decided we're going to make our playlist Chicago-centric.

881
00:57:07,873 --> 00:57:10,695
It ended up being about 80% bands and artists from Chicago,

882
00:57:10,695 --> 00:57:11,935
and we're quite happy about that.

883
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,318
But it's not something that we sold well, I think.

884
00:57:15,318 --> 00:57:17,600
It's not something that we communicated enough,

885
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:19,222
because we were really happy with the playlist.

886
00:57:19,222 --> 00:57:22,725
I don't think it really necessarily set the world on fire,

887
00:57:22,725 --> 00:57:25,287
but if I were to do it again, I'd do the exact same playlist.

888
00:57:25,287 --> 00:57:29,231
And we had a lot of help from the whole Ubisoft studio

889
00:57:29,231 --> 00:57:30,592
in acquiring those licenses,

890
00:57:30,592 --> 00:57:32,714
and we were really happy how it turned out.

891
00:57:32,714 --> 00:57:34,956
There was a bit of everything for everyone in it.

892
00:57:36,110 --> 00:57:42,052
In the end, you know, the diegetic music existed in the world, and we had to be sure that, you know, for the conflicts,

893
00:57:42,052 --> 00:57:45,054
there was always clear rules about what was going to happen.

894
00:57:45,054 --> 00:57:48,795
And as I said earlier on, gameplay was king, so we always had to be sure that, you know,

895
00:57:48,795 --> 00:57:51,957
when there was important gameplay feedback, diegetic music would go away.

896
00:57:51,957 --> 00:57:55,138
And when mission music would come in, diegetic music would go away as well.

897
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:58,600
So that was basically the rule we had, and it ended up working well for us.

898
00:57:58,600 --> 00:58:03,061
This is our cutting-edge license management tool at Microsoft Excel.

899
00:58:03,362 --> 00:58:05,162
So we kept track of everything in there

900
00:58:05,162 --> 00:58:07,863
just to be sure, you know, this is the ones we've cleared,

901
00:58:07,863 --> 00:58:08,903
and this is the information.

902
00:58:08,903 --> 00:58:10,664
Do we acquire this at the very start of the game?

903
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:12,585
Does it come in later? Et cetera, et cetera.

904
00:58:12,585 --> 00:58:14,325
So we had this very powerful tool

905
00:58:14,325 --> 00:58:15,866
to keep track of everything.

906
00:58:15,866 --> 00:58:17,786
As I said, you know, you could, you know,

907
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,427
build up your musical playlist

908
00:58:19,427 --> 00:58:20,487
as you progress through the game.

909
00:58:20,487 --> 00:58:20,867
You could edit it.

910
00:58:20,867 --> 00:58:22,668
There was a lot of, you know, hidden information

911
00:58:22,668 --> 00:58:24,748
about the place, which we thought was really cool.

912
00:58:24,748 --> 00:58:26,349
We had artist bios in there

913
00:58:26,349 --> 00:58:28,970
if you wanted to learn more about the artists and all that.

914
00:58:29,030 --> 00:58:34,913
You could actually hack the music away from the speakers in the world if you didn't already have it in your playlist.

915
00:58:34,913 --> 00:58:37,715
We had a Shazam-like app in the game as well.

916
00:58:37,715 --> 00:58:39,737
So that was a lot of fun to set up.

917
00:58:39,737 --> 00:58:45,941
And the way it was working, the whole licensed music system, is every time we had a song playing,

918
00:58:45,941 --> 00:58:48,582
we had three versions of that track that were pre-processed,

919
00:58:48,582 --> 00:58:52,725
and the system would switch between which version of the track should be playing depending on where it was playing from.

920
00:58:52,725 --> 00:58:57,108
So this is how it sounded within the different emitters.

921
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:14,410
That's when a vehicle is driving down the street, that's the version you would hear of that track.

922
00:59:14,410 --> 00:59:15,630
Coming from the speaker.

923
00:59:15,630 --> 00:59:19,831
You listen yourself to your music player, if you're sitting in that car, that's what's going to happen.

924
00:59:19,831 --> 00:59:22,192
Those are the very different versions.

925
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:25,553
And we chose that system instead of having real time processing on the tracks,

926
00:59:25,553 --> 00:59:28,553
because it was much easier to handle for the current gen guys.

927
00:59:28,733 --> 00:59:32,519
the main reasoning behind this technological decision.

928
00:59:32,519 --> 00:59:35,523
We also had an additional filter on the music

929
00:59:35,523 --> 00:59:39,709
to account for the vehicles and how broken they were.

930
00:59:39,709 --> 00:59:42,233
So if you would break the windows, filtering would be different

931
00:59:42,233 --> 00:59:44,195
on that very specific version of the track.

932
00:59:44,736 --> 00:59:48,559
And to wrap it up very quickly, because I think we're going over time,

933
00:59:48,559 --> 00:59:52,242
what we learned about doing Wajang, and what we learned doing it,

934
00:59:52,242 --> 00:59:54,804
structure and planning is important, but as well,

935
00:59:54,804 --> 00:59:58,467
really the relationships you're going to forge with the other people on your team,

936
00:59:58,467 --> 01:00:01,170
and especially the other teams, whether it be animation, programming, and all that.

937
01:00:01,510 --> 01:00:04,210
Those are the ones that are really going to pay off down the line.

938
01:00:04,210 --> 01:00:06,831
We bought ourselves a lot of goodwill from the engine team,

939
01:00:06,831 --> 01:00:10,372
and that allowed us to do a lot of stuff and work well beyond

940
01:00:10,372 --> 01:00:12,673
where we could have been expected to be locked out of the data.

941
01:00:12,673 --> 01:00:14,813
So that's really important to keep in mind.

942
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:16,854
Play nice with the other teams.

943
01:00:16,854 --> 01:00:21,555
Also, doing in-house music allowed us to reach our creative objectives,

944
01:00:21,555 --> 01:00:23,976
which was really have that tailor-made music to the missions.

945
01:00:24,176 --> 01:00:26,357
I think we, you know, we aimed pretty high,

946
01:00:26,357 --> 01:00:28,298
and I think for us, we reached our objective

947
01:00:28,298 --> 01:00:31,260
as close as we could get it with this project,

948
01:00:31,260 --> 01:00:33,061
and we're really happy we got to do it.

949
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:35,982
But it wasn't, you know, there's some tough lessons

950
01:00:35,982 --> 01:00:36,622
learned as well.

951
01:00:36,622 --> 01:00:39,404
We're still having a hard time reaching polish phase.

952
01:00:39,404 --> 01:00:41,445
The music for the last mission came in

953
01:00:41,445 --> 01:00:44,086
as we were doing the final pass on the mix of the game.

954
01:00:44,086 --> 01:00:46,067
So that, what you hear in the game in the final mission

955
01:00:46,067 --> 01:00:48,148
is the actual first draft of that music.

956
01:00:48,148 --> 01:00:49,009
Thank God it worked well.

957
01:00:49,009 --> 01:00:50,710
As you can see, Pavel is already...

958
01:00:51,050 --> 01:00:54,171
You know, he's a very rigid and rigorous guy when he makes music.

959
01:00:54,171 --> 01:00:57,912
So that worked as it was, but, you know, it got in just as we were mixing it,

960
01:00:57,912 --> 01:01:01,114
so we didn't have a lot of time to iterate on it.

961
01:01:01,114 --> 01:01:03,135
And we can manage the conflicts within the music system,

962
01:01:03,135 --> 01:01:05,656
but it's not always seamless transition, as you can see,

963
01:01:05,656 --> 01:01:07,556
for example, with the Vigilante systems.

964
01:01:07,556 --> 01:01:09,117
We still haven't found the perfect formula,

965
01:01:09,117 --> 01:01:13,319
but it's going to be a lot of fun, you know, trying to refine that on different projects.

966
01:01:13,319 --> 01:01:16,680
But, you know, we're happy with the balance we struck on this one.

967
01:01:17,900 --> 01:01:20,182
And a lot of needs for a project this size

968
01:01:20,182 --> 01:01:22,783
only materialize close to the end of the game.

969
01:01:22,783 --> 01:01:24,424
So you always have to keep that in mind

970
01:01:24,424 --> 01:01:26,145
and be reactive to what's gonna happen later

971
01:01:26,145 --> 01:01:27,886
and maybe try to keep a bit of buffer,

972
01:01:27,886 --> 01:01:29,646
whether it's budget or time,

973
01:01:29,646 --> 01:01:30,607
close to the end of a project

974
01:01:30,607 --> 01:01:32,228
to be sure that you're able to react to these things.

975
01:01:32,228 --> 01:01:34,489
I've been closed on a light note.

976
01:01:34,489 --> 01:01:35,890
This is it for our presentation.

977
01:01:35,890 --> 01:01:37,110
There's one thing we like to try.

978
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,031
I've got a few Easter eggs here,

979
01:01:38,031 --> 01:01:40,452
but I'm just gonna play one, which is my favorite one.

980
01:01:40,452 --> 01:01:42,793
During the course of the production,

981
01:01:42,793 --> 01:01:44,734
something got left on the cutting room floor

982
01:01:44,734 --> 01:01:47,095
and it involved a very...

983
01:01:47,475 --> 01:01:53,900
thorough narrative aspect which was you know there's this cartoon playing in the world and kids are really into it and it's all about

984
01:01:53,900 --> 01:01:59,523
These Pokemon like characters, and we really got carried away trying to imagine the theme song for that cartoon

985
01:01:59,523 --> 01:02:04,386
Which was really like this 80s song for an 80s cartoon with a bit of a Japanese flavor to it

986
01:02:04,507 --> 01:02:08,107
So I'm going to play this song, and this got, you know, this didn't make it into the game,

987
01:02:08,107 --> 01:02:11,888
but what did make it is a small three-second portion of that song.

988
01:02:11,888 --> 01:02:16,829
I'm going to raise my hand when it plays, and that small portion is what we used as

989
01:02:16,829 --> 01:02:19,610
the news jingle for every news broadcast in the game.

990
01:02:19,610 --> 01:02:20,210
So you're going to hear it.

991
01:02:20,210 --> 01:02:21,210
That's the story behind that.

992
01:02:21,210 --> 01:02:27,211
I was playing the song and performed on the team.

993
01:02:27,211 --> 01:02:30,112
Forces of nature have fought each other since the dawn of time.

994
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:31,152
I was playing the song and performed on the team.

995
01:02:31,152 --> 01:02:32,652
Forces of nature have fought each other since the dawn of time.

996
01:02:35,422 --> 01:02:39,425
That was it. That was our newest broadcast jingle right there.

997
01:02:39,425 --> 01:02:43,649
And it...

998
01:02:43,649 --> 01:02:44,890
All right, we're going to cut it short.

999
01:02:44,890 --> 01:02:45,991
That was a lot of fun.

1000
01:02:45,991 --> 01:02:50,194
And who's singing right now is an AI programmer on Far Cry, actually.

1001
01:02:50,194 --> 01:02:52,576
So, you know, we got to work with other teams as well.

1002
01:02:52,576 --> 01:02:56,499
It's Raphael Parra, and we're really grateful he lent his voice to our little project.

1003
01:02:56,499 --> 01:02:57,520
So that's about it for us.

1004
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,802
Thank you so much for coming to our presentation.

1005
01:02:59,802 --> 01:03:01,143
We really appreciate you guys coming.
