1
00:00:11,754 --> 00:00:11,954
So, hi.

2
00:00:11,954 --> 00:00:13,876
My name is James Coltrane.

3
00:00:13,876 --> 00:00:19,619
I'm the founder and lead developer at Historiated Games, a studio focused on historically themed

4
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:19,839
games.

5
00:00:19,839 --> 00:00:24,962
I'm also a history PhD and a former history professor, and currently a professor of game

6
00:00:24,962 --> 00:00:26,323
art at the University of Connecticut.

7
00:00:26,323 --> 00:00:31,146
And I'm here to talk to you about the experience I had making our first game, Blackhaven.

8
00:00:31,766 --> 00:00:33,427
Blackhaven was released in the summer of 2021,

9
00:00:33,427 --> 00:00:36,929
and it follows a student named Kendra Turner

10
00:00:36,929 --> 00:00:39,931
as she uncovers a trail of secrets and misdeeds

11
00:00:39,931 --> 00:00:42,533
at a colonial plantation museum.

12
00:00:42,533 --> 00:00:44,074
Historia is also tiny.

13
00:00:44,074 --> 00:00:47,316
On the technical end, it's a solo dev operation.

14
00:00:47,316 --> 00:00:49,997
I do all the research, art, coding, and audio.

15
00:00:49,997 --> 00:00:53,059
But as you'll see, the most important parts of Blackhaven

16
00:00:53,059 --> 00:00:54,580
were very much a team effort.

17
00:00:55,510 --> 00:00:58,852
The game was originally intended to be a small free teaser

18
00:00:58,852 --> 00:01:01,894
for a larger game called Cassius, a first-person

19
00:01:01,894 --> 00:01:03,735
narrative puzzle game taking place

20
00:01:03,735 --> 00:01:07,638
in a colonial American plantation estate called Blackhaven

21
00:01:07,638 --> 00:01:07,938
Hall.

22
00:01:07,938 --> 00:01:10,139
Cassius came out of my experience

23
00:01:10,139 --> 00:01:11,981
teaching American history, and I had

24
00:01:11,981 --> 00:01:13,682
worked with a team of other scholars

25
00:01:13,682 --> 00:01:15,343
to help craft a story that might teach

26
00:01:15,343 --> 00:01:18,745
about the relationship of slavery to America's founding.

27
00:01:18,745 --> 00:01:20,206
Blackhaven, on the other hand, was

28
00:01:20,206 --> 00:01:23,368
inspired by experiences I had researching Cassius in places

29
00:01:23,368 --> 00:01:24,488
like Williamsburg, Virginia.

30
00:01:25,143 --> 00:01:28,184
where the history of slavery should be central.

31
00:01:28,184 --> 00:01:29,804
In the 18th century, enslaved people

32
00:01:29,804 --> 00:01:32,725
made up half the population of the colony's capital

33
00:01:32,725 --> 00:01:34,886
and about 40% of Virginia's population,

34
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:36,826
hundreds of thousands of people.

35
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:38,287
And yet, even though many institutions

36
00:01:38,287 --> 00:01:39,807
are attempting to do a better job

37
00:01:39,807 --> 00:01:41,628
portraying the realities of slavery,

38
00:01:41,628 --> 00:01:43,288
there are other places that often

39
00:01:43,288 --> 00:01:44,769
obscure it or ignore it entirely.

40
00:01:44,769 --> 00:01:47,630
And it's a very surreal and confounding experience

41
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,930
to be exploring celebratory exhibits

42
00:01:49,930 --> 00:01:51,371
at some of these sites while knowing

43
00:01:51,371 --> 00:01:54,151
the massive scale of human suffering being ignored.

44
00:01:54,592 --> 00:01:58,814
I thought it would be really interesting to explore this feeling in a shorter narrative teaser game

45
00:01:58,814 --> 00:02:04,216
that visited Blackhaven Hall as it might be depicted in a similar present-day museum.

46
00:02:04,216 --> 00:02:08,779
As a tiny studio working on a sensitive topic for our first game, I also thought this might

47
00:02:08,779 --> 00:02:13,501
provide a gentle way to introduce the topic to players, and I was inspired by the success of

48
00:02:13,501 --> 00:02:17,303
free narrative games like Marie's Room and the reception that they'd received on Steam.

49
00:02:18,198 --> 00:02:20,219
In the story of Cassius, Blackhaven Hall

50
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:23,121
is the ancestral home of the Harwood family,

51
00:02:23,121 --> 00:02:26,744
led in the Revolutionary Era by patriarch Thomas Harwood.

52
00:02:26,744 --> 00:02:28,425
Thomas is an American revolutionary

53
00:02:28,425 --> 00:02:30,286
and an Enlightenment dabbler.

54
00:02:30,286 --> 00:02:32,307
And like Washington, Jefferson, and Madison,

55
00:02:32,307 --> 00:02:33,969
his wealth depended on the hundreds

56
00:02:33,969 --> 00:02:36,050
of people he had enslaved.

57
00:02:36,050 --> 00:02:38,592
Blackhaven Hall is burned to the ground by British soldiers

58
00:02:38,592 --> 00:02:41,434
during the American Revolution, leaving a site of ruins

59
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:43,615
that look very much like these real life ones

60
00:02:43,615 --> 00:02:45,356
from Rosewell Plantation in Virginia.

61
00:02:46,608 --> 00:02:50,710
When I began thinking about how to design Blackhaven's fictional museum,

62
00:02:50,710 --> 00:02:54,973
it was important that this environment feel realistic and grounded, even pedestrian.

63
00:02:54,973 --> 00:02:59,435
Without the cost of materials, many game museums are like this, at monumental scales.

64
00:02:59,435 --> 00:03:03,978
But I did a lot of research on cost-effective architecture and mundane details.

65
00:03:04,478 --> 00:03:07,260
The dated and dull museum design places the structure

66
00:03:07,260 --> 00:03:09,341
in about the early 70s or so, and I thus

67
00:03:09,341 --> 00:03:11,102
began thinking about how to convey

68
00:03:11,102 --> 00:03:13,684
an entire institutional history spanning different eras.

69
00:03:13,684 --> 00:03:16,225
I created a back story for decades

70
00:03:16,225 --> 00:03:18,687
of the museum and its directors, some of which

71
00:03:18,687 --> 00:03:21,008
were added to this in-game sign.

72
00:03:21,008 --> 00:03:23,029
The sense of time was also reflected

73
00:03:23,029 --> 00:03:25,010
in details like marketing posters

74
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:27,332
on display in the museum offices,

75
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:30,553
all based on surviving 20th century designs,

76
00:03:30,553 --> 00:03:32,495
and the different books for sale in the gift shop.

77
00:03:33,456 --> 00:03:35,938
By far the biggest contrast between eras

78
00:03:35,938 --> 00:03:38,279
was in the ruins of Blackhaven itself,

79
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,381
which in the game had recently been transformed

80
00:03:40,381 --> 00:03:43,703
into a slick modern steel and glass reconstruction.

81
00:03:43,703 --> 00:03:46,005
I researched a lot about structural glass projects

82
00:03:46,005 --> 00:03:47,246
and trying to get this look right,

83
00:03:47,246 --> 00:03:49,368
but it was actually directly inspired

84
00:03:49,368 --> 00:03:51,529
by a similar project at Minokin,

85
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:54,331
another small privately managed plantation home museum.

86
00:03:55,145 --> 00:03:57,847
Players would explore the house while listening to a smarmy

87
00:03:57,847 --> 00:04:00,289
audio tour, narrated by yours truly.

88
00:04:00,289 --> 00:04:03,591
And here, too, I tried to include a sense

89
00:04:03,591 --> 00:04:04,852
of the extended history.

90
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:07,715
The tour guide mentions a number of folk legends

91
00:04:07,715 --> 00:04:09,616
about different parts of the house,

92
00:04:09,616 --> 00:04:11,097
and the glass structure attempted

93
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:13,900
to account for realistic structural support and HVAC,

94
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:17,863
although as some players had mentioned, probably correctly,

95
00:04:17,863 --> 00:04:20,365
that this space would absolutely bake in the summer.

96
00:04:21,385 --> 00:04:26,092
Aside from Black Haven, trying to make Black Haven feel like a real place, I wanted to

97
00:04:26,092 --> 00:04:30,899
create a sense of uneasiness in the game for players even before they uncovered the museum's

98
00:04:30,899 --> 00:04:32,061
worst secrets.

99
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,112
Throughout the displays and audio tours,

100
00:04:34,112 --> 00:04:35,692
enslaved people are euphemistically

101
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,013
referred to as servants.

102
00:04:37,013 --> 00:04:40,154
A family portrait featuring an enslaved woman

103
00:04:40,154 --> 00:04:42,174
crops her out when duplicated on a book cover.

104
00:04:42,174 --> 00:04:45,935
The same gift shop features thoughtless marketing slogans,

105
00:04:45,935 --> 00:04:48,976
like the ones for these very unique dolls.

106
00:04:48,976 --> 00:04:50,776
And this book cover would show that they

107
00:04:50,776 --> 00:04:52,196
don't expect diverse visitors.

108
00:04:53,157 --> 00:04:56,458
And a fully readable, illustrated children's book

109
00:04:56,458 --> 00:04:58,860
not only praises the Harwood family's patriotism,

110
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:02,422
but also the undeserved devotion of their put-upon worker,

111
00:05:02,422 --> 00:05:04,663
Farmer Joe, while totally omitting

112
00:05:04,663 --> 00:05:06,764
the presence, contributions, and hardships

113
00:05:06,764 --> 00:05:08,225
of black Americans entirely.

114
00:05:08,225 --> 00:05:11,107
About halfway through the game, players

115
00:05:11,107 --> 00:05:13,608
are tasked with scanning documents in the archive.

116
00:05:13,608 --> 00:05:15,209
After noticing some discrepancies,

117
00:05:15,209 --> 00:05:17,590
they find a trove of incriminating and disturbing

118
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:20,472
evidence that forms the most important part of Blackhaven.

119
00:05:21,277 --> 00:05:27,239
In this section, our narrative team had a set of historical educational messages we wanted the game to convey.

120
00:05:27,239 --> 00:05:34,321
First, we wanted to show the real and meaningful harm resulting from Blackhaven's involvement with slavery and segregation,

121
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:39,803
neither sanitizing this difficult history nor exploitatively dwelling on every gruesome detail.

122
00:05:39,803 --> 00:05:46,765
Second, to show that these harms have persisted to the present day and how the museum and the Harwood family have enabled this legacy.

123
00:05:47,549 --> 00:05:50,450
Third, and finally, that in every era,

124
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:53,190
there were black Americans actively resisting

125
00:05:53,190 --> 00:05:55,231
and trying to make the best lives for themselves

126
00:05:55,231 --> 00:05:57,812
and their families, even if these efforts were not always

127
00:05:57,812 --> 00:05:58,352
successful.

128
00:05:58,352 --> 00:06:02,233
Each of the game's documents were based incredibly closely

129
00:06:02,233 --> 00:06:03,733
on existing historical records.

130
00:06:03,733 --> 00:06:06,334
A missing page of Thomas Harwood's diary

131
00:06:06,334 --> 00:06:08,394
reveals a particularly cruel incident

132
00:06:08,394 --> 00:06:09,715
between him and an enslaved mother.

133
00:06:09,715 --> 00:06:12,575
And both the violence and his writing style

134
00:06:12,575 --> 00:06:14,616
were taken directly from the real life Virginia

135
00:06:14,616 --> 00:06:16,516
enslaved William Byrd II.

136
00:06:17,553 --> 00:06:21,995
When trying to mimic a historical voice, I look closely at sentence structure and especially

137
00:06:21,995 --> 00:06:26,777
word choice, sometimes searching for particular terms in the Google Ngram tool to make sure

138
00:06:26,777 --> 00:06:28,258
that they were period correct.

139
00:06:29,138 --> 00:06:31,739
In perhaps the game's most disturbing example,

140
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,180
players read love letters between the Civil War era

141
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:36,661
spouses, Gideon and Anna Harwood.

142
00:06:36,661 --> 00:06:39,182
Anna Harwood's writing is full of petty complaints

143
00:06:39,182 --> 00:06:42,964
and offensive language about her enslaved house staff,

144
00:06:42,964 --> 00:06:46,045
taking plenty of attitude from the even more explicit

145
00:06:46,045 --> 00:06:48,606
and unsettling diary of real slaveholding wife,

146
00:06:48,606 --> 00:06:49,386
Mary Chestnut.

147
00:06:50,107 --> 00:06:59,497
Confederate soldier Gideon Harwood at first seems more compassionate of the couple before confessing his role in the grisly murder of black Union prisoners of war,

148
00:06:59,497 --> 00:07:05,443
with some of the confession lifted from surviving accounts of Nathan Bedford Forrest's role in the Fort Pillow Massacre depicted here.

149
00:07:06,794 --> 00:07:10,937
The documents also show how Blackhaven began rewriting its own history well before the

150
00:07:10,937 --> 00:07:11,717
present day.

151
00:07:11,717 --> 00:07:16,280
Players read through a commemorative speech dedicating a statue of Gideon Harwood with

152
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:20,403
treacly florid language and overt affirmations of white supremacy.

153
00:07:20,403 --> 00:07:26,286
The address was inspired by a real life one given at the dedication of the so-called Silent

154
00:07:26,286 --> 00:07:31,390
Sam Confederate Monument, which was only recently removed from the campus of the University

155
00:07:31,390 --> 00:07:32,831
of North Carolina Chapel Hill.

156
00:07:33,743 --> 00:07:36,645
The game also features a bizarre catechism

157
00:07:36,645 --> 00:07:39,806
intended to instruct children visiting Blackhaven.

158
00:07:39,806 --> 00:07:42,207
It contains a series of questions and answers

159
00:07:42,207 --> 00:07:44,748
brazenly distorting Blackhaven's history,

160
00:07:44,748 --> 00:07:47,870
but was adapted word for word in some places

161
00:07:47,870 --> 00:07:50,331
from similar real-life documents once produced

162
00:07:50,331 --> 00:07:52,672
by the Daughters of the Confederacy organization.

163
00:07:53,892 --> 00:07:56,794
But so too do players find evidence of black resistance

164
00:07:56,794 --> 00:07:59,476
and perseverance, from a newspaper ad placed

165
00:07:59,476 --> 00:08:01,898
by newly freed slaves attempting to reconnect

166
00:08:01,898 --> 00:08:05,620
with lost relatives, to the mid-20th century inquiries

167
00:08:05,620 --> 00:08:08,742
of the fictional Dorothy Mitchell, a local activist

168
00:08:08,742 --> 00:08:11,044
and amateur historian who applies to research

169
00:08:11,044 --> 00:08:12,364
in Blackhaven's archives.

170
00:08:13,055 --> 00:08:17,759
Mitchell believes that she may be descended from an illegitimate mixed-race child of Blackhaven's

171
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:23,504
William Harwood, and this not only gives players a historical mystery to solve, but also mirrors

172
00:08:23,504 --> 00:08:29,749
the centuries-long pursuit of the descendants of Thomas Jefferson and the underage enslaved

173
00:08:29,749 --> 00:08:34,913
Sally Hemings to confirm their ancestry, which they eventually achieved through DNA testing.

174
00:08:36,467 --> 00:08:38,709
So now we had a realistic museum environment

175
00:08:38,709 --> 00:08:40,271
with a rich and troubled history,

176
00:08:40,271 --> 00:08:42,774
but because these subjects were so sensitive,

177
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:44,315
we weren't sure we could give players

178
00:08:44,315 --> 00:08:47,238
the freedom to explore these places without context.

179
00:08:47,457 --> 00:08:50,559
We needed instead to have them play as a protagonist who could

180
00:08:50,559 --> 00:08:52,440
push back against Blackhaven's distortions.

181
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:54,402
And it made sense for the character

182
00:08:54,402 --> 00:08:56,743
to take on multiple roles as an outsider.

183
00:08:56,743 --> 00:08:59,986
To that end, I began sketching the character

184
00:08:59,986 --> 00:09:03,649
of Kendra Turner, a young Black woman attending an HBCU,

185
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:06,371
or Historically Black College and University,

186
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:09,453
and working at Blackhaven as a summer marketing intern,

187
00:09:09,453 --> 00:09:11,194
often relegated to the front desk,

188
00:09:11,194 --> 00:09:13,756
as she does in this game, serving on the holiday.

189
00:09:14,557 --> 00:09:18,120
But Kendra's perspective was not one that was part of my life experience,

190
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:20,903
nor one that could be uncovered through historical research.

191
00:09:20,903 --> 00:09:25,828
Blackhaven needed to collaborate with people who shared Kendra's real-world experiences.

192
00:09:25,828 --> 00:09:30,212
At this point, the advisory board I'd been working with on Cassius and Blackhaven

193
00:09:30,212 --> 00:09:36,718
suggested that I contact Dr. Sharon Roberts, a media scholar at Xavier University of Louisiana,

194
00:09:36,718 --> 00:09:38,840
who could help consult on the HBCU experience.

195
00:09:39,711 --> 00:09:44,734
I talked through the outline of Blackhaven with Sharon and Charlene Senegal-Decour, one

196
00:09:44,734 --> 00:09:47,015
of Xavier's historians, and we settled on a plan.

197
00:09:47,015 --> 00:09:52,518
We would convene a panel of women Xavier's students who shared Kendra's identity and

198
00:09:52,518 --> 00:09:54,959
do a table read of the script of Blackhaven.

199
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,202
These students would not be previously familiar with the museum exhibits or the historical

200
00:09:59,202 --> 00:10:03,384
documents and we would take note of and discuss their reactions to everything the character

201
00:10:03,384 --> 00:10:07,106
of Kendra would see and take their input on how they thought she might react.

202
00:10:07,899 --> 00:10:11,844
Finally, and most importantly, while we would ask the students for their input on every

203
00:10:11,844 --> 00:10:16,330
aspect of the game, we would specifically give them the final say on the character of

204
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:17,691
Kendra and all of her dialogue.

205
00:10:18,764 --> 00:10:21,505
What followed was an incredibly rewarding and illuminating

206
00:10:21,505 --> 00:10:22,325
experience.

207
00:10:22,325 --> 00:10:25,927
The student team, consisting of Tyra Johnson, Naomi Winston,

208
00:10:25,927 --> 00:10:28,548
and Tia Alphonse, were passionate and vocal

209
00:10:28,548 --> 00:10:30,809
throughout the discussion, both on small details

210
00:10:30,809 --> 00:10:31,529
and big themes.

211
00:10:31,529 --> 00:10:34,450
On the lighter side, they discussed Kendra's hair,

212
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,572
with at least two of the group advocating for the hairstyle

213
00:10:37,572 --> 00:10:39,032
that they themselves had.

214
00:10:39,032 --> 00:10:40,233
This is what we went with.

215
00:10:40,887 --> 00:10:46,050
There were spirited discussions about what slang and phrasing was accurate for a college-aged

216
00:10:46,050 --> 00:10:50,892
woman, in one case hashing out regional differences between that used in New Orleans where many

217
00:10:50,892 --> 00:10:54,774
of them went to school and those that would be likely used in Virginia where Kendra had

218
00:10:54,774 --> 00:10:55,535
grown up.

219
00:10:55,535 --> 00:10:59,917
The students also gave very valuable feedback on much more consequential things.

220
00:10:59,917 --> 00:11:05,279
They discussed the many micro and even macro aggressions that Kendra experiences as a woman

221
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:06,540
in a primarily white space.

222
00:11:07,225 --> 00:11:12,750
For instance, when Kendra arrives, she receives an email from her boss with strict patronizing

223
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:17,914
instructions for her dress, hairstyle, and speech, but players can also find the welcome

224
00:11:17,914 --> 00:11:21,417
letter to Catherine, the previous summer's white summer intern.

225
00:11:21,417 --> 00:11:27,082
In it, the same boss is now warm and gregarious, showing none of the suspicion that she does

226
00:11:27,082 --> 00:11:27,683
towards Kendra.

227
00:11:27,683 --> 00:11:31,346
The team also weighed in on some of the ugliest parts of Blackhaven.

228
00:11:31,951 --> 00:11:34,733
We had an extended discussion about the use of racial slurs

229
00:11:34,733 --> 00:11:37,776
in the game's documents, particularly the Civil War

230
00:11:37,776 --> 00:11:39,677
letters from the Harwoods.

231
00:11:39,677 --> 00:11:42,960
I mentioned that Mary Chestnut's diary often

232
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,642
had even more frequently offensive language,

233
00:11:45,642 --> 00:11:48,004
but equally acknowledged that our future black players

234
00:11:48,004 --> 00:11:50,506
of the game might be put off by being bombarded

235
00:11:50,506 --> 00:11:53,509
with harsh language they were already far too familiar with

236
00:11:53,509 --> 00:11:54,890
when trying to enjoy a video game.

237
00:11:55,508 --> 00:11:58,951
After discussing a variety of perspectives from the students

238
00:11:58,951 --> 00:12:02,814
and faculty, we settled on the game's current balance.

239
00:12:02,814 --> 00:12:04,996
Exemplifying this discussion is the final letter

240
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:06,077
from the character of Anna.

241
00:12:06,077 --> 00:12:09,639
In it, she uses one of the ugliest racial slurs possible.

242
00:12:09,639 --> 00:12:13,142
But because the copy the player is reading in the archives

243
00:12:13,142 --> 00:12:15,124
has been transcribed from the original letter,

244
00:12:15,124 --> 00:12:18,186
the slur is dashed out after the first letter,

245
00:12:18,186 --> 00:12:20,368
sparing the player the full impact,

246
00:12:20,368 --> 00:12:23,150
but also showing that even Blackhaven's typist felt

247
00:12:23,150 --> 00:12:25,152
uncomfortable copying the exact text.

248
00:12:26,272 --> 00:12:29,095
The final piece of the puzzle in bringing Kendra to life

249
00:12:29,095 --> 00:12:30,657
was casting the right actress.

250
00:12:30,657 --> 00:12:34,141
Dr. Roberts had suggested that a former Xavier student of hers,

251
00:12:34,141 --> 00:12:36,984
Darby Farr, who was pursuing an acting career,

252
00:12:36,984 --> 00:12:39,166
might be a possible option.

253
00:12:39,166 --> 00:12:41,369
I read over Zoom with Darby for the part

254
00:12:41,369 --> 00:12:43,732
and was so impressed with her impromptu audition

255
00:12:43,732 --> 00:12:46,075
that I offered her the part without reading another actor.

256
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:52,524
The decision proved crucial, as Darby's performance was one of the most consistently praised aspects of Blackhaven,

257
00:12:52,524 --> 00:12:57,508
giving Kendra the empathy that would allow players to feel the gravity of the situation,

258
00:12:57,508 --> 00:13:02,372
but also bringing a feisty wit to the character that empowered Kendra as the story progressed.

259
00:13:03,875 --> 00:13:06,817
So now we had a thoughtful, even timely narrative

260
00:13:06,817 --> 00:13:09,318
dealing with some important historical issues.

261
00:13:09,318 --> 00:13:10,759
But how do we do as a game?

262
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:14,361
Let's talk about the release, some mistakes we made

263
00:13:14,361 --> 00:13:15,742
and challenges that we faced,

264
00:13:15,742 --> 00:13:17,823
and in the end, where we think we succeeded.

265
00:13:19,141 --> 00:13:21,802
We released Blackhaven last July for PC on Steam.

266
00:13:21,802 --> 00:13:24,823
Because of the sensitivity of the subject,

267
00:13:24,823 --> 00:13:26,783
we didn't feel like doing a lot of the raw, raw

268
00:13:26,783 --> 00:13:29,304
guerrilla marketing often recommended to new studios.

269
00:13:29,304 --> 00:13:32,785
And so the game was released with very little advanced word

270
00:13:32,785 --> 00:13:35,866
beyond posts on our existing social media and Reddit.

271
00:13:36,187 --> 00:13:41,513
I sent press releases to probably about 200 journalists seeking coverage, and while early

272
00:13:41,513 --> 00:13:45,998
on attention from games media was hard to come by, we did better initially with traditional

273
00:13:45,998 --> 00:13:51,164
media outlets like NPR and Smithsonian Magazine who were attracted to the game's historical

274
00:13:51,164 --> 00:13:51,785
significance.

275
00:13:53,515 --> 00:13:59,580
In the first couple of weeks, we also were helped by a couple of positive reviews from

276
00:13:59,580 --> 00:14:03,264
smaller GamesPress and overall good reactions from Steam reviewers.

277
00:14:03,264 --> 00:14:08,968
Our biggest media coverage came from a feature story in Polygon, which contrasted our team's

278
00:14:08,968 --> 00:14:13,552
approach to historical gaming with the very mixed reception of Fortnite's Martin Luther

279
00:14:13,552 --> 00:14:15,054
King interactive experience.

280
00:14:15,853 --> 00:14:21,638
I should mention that while this media coverage was very helpful with legitimizing Historiated

281
00:14:21,638 --> 00:14:26,161
as well as providing some very unique networking opportunities, we didn't see a large bump

282
00:14:26,161 --> 00:14:28,703
in downloads connected to particular coverage.

283
00:14:28,703 --> 00:14:31,465
So how did our game do with players?

284
00:14:34,126 --> 00:14:38,968
As of today, Blackhaven has been played by over 30,000 players in over 90 countries.

285
00:14:38,968 --> 00:14:45,410
The game currently holds an 80% positive rating on Steam, which places it in the Very Positive

286
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,050
category.

287
00:14:46,050 --> 00:14:50,692
This fell quite a bit short of some of the free walking sims that had inspired us to

288
00:14:50,692 --> 00:14:55,694
release Blackhaven, but at the same time, the game was one of the most publicly successful

289
00:14:55,694 --> 00:14:58,235
humanities-themed games ever to come out of the Academy.

290
00:14:59,075 --> 00:15:03,459
Finally, the game has done very well with indie festivals and awards.

291
00:15:03,459 --> 00:15:08,282
Blackhaven was an official IndieCade selection, was initially nominated for the Impact Game

292
00:15:08,282 --> 00:15:13,946
and Narrative Game Awards, and won a Grand Jury Award for Innovation and Experience Design.

293
00:15:13,946 --> 00:15:19,710
Blackhaven was also nominated, or named, an honorable mention in the Excellence in Narrative

294
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,534
category at IGF, the Independent Games Festival, which of course is being celebrated this week.

295
00:15:25,248 --> 00:15:27,748
We saw a slight bump in downloads during festivals

296
00:15:27,748 --> 00:15:29,789
and after these announcements, but again,

297
00:15:29,789 --> 00:15:32,790
not enough to make winning awards a significant factor

298
00:15:32,790 --> 00:15:34,390
in the game's numerical success.

299
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:39,151
Being a first-time studio, we also made plenty of mistakes,

300
00:15:39,151 --> 00:15:41,332
and the game also faced some unique challenges

301
00:15:41,332 --> 00:15:44,513
during its development, so let's highlight some of those.

302
00:15:44,513 --> 00:15:46,113
One difficulty we had with Blackhaven

303
00:15:46,113 --> 00:15:49,014
was the game's placement in relation to potential audiences.

304
00:15:49,817 --> 00:15:55,181
Cassius had always been planned as a relatively high-fidelity puzzle game with a gothic atmosphere,

305
00:15:55,181 --> 00:15:59,785
something that might appeal to players of games like Soma and Edith Finch.

306
00:15:59,785 --> 00:16:04,789
Blackhaven was a far more restrained and deliberate game, but when it was stretched to over two

307
00:16:04,789 --> 00:16:09,092
hours, it was less appealing to some of the high-end gaming crowd.

308
00:16:09,092 --> 00:16:13,776
At the same time, many casual players who appreciate slower narratives didn't have

309
00:16:13,776 --> 00:16:15,998
the hardware to keep up with Blackhaven's graphics.

310
00:16:16,786 --> 00:16:19,127
Another aspect of this dilemma was optimization.

311
00:16:19,127 --> 00:16:21,728
As we thought about our recommended hardware,

312
00:16:21,728 --> 00:16:25,689
we thought our recommended hardware was fairly accurate,

313
00:16:25,689 --> 00:16:27,649
but Blackhaven being the first game that I developed

314
00:16:27,649 --> 00:16:28,730
as a near solo dev,

315
00:16:28,730 --> 00:16:31,911
the game was not especially well optimized.

316
00:16:31,911 --> 00:16:33,611
If player systems could run The Witcher 3,

317
00:16:33,611 --> 00:16:36,892
they were often very put off if Blackhaven lagged,

318
00:16:36,892 --> 00:16:38,393
even if their machine fell below

319
00:16:38,393 --> 00:16:39,873
our hardware recommendations.

320
00:16:41,195 --> 00:16:45,339
Both of these problems illustrate one of the contradictions of releasing a free game to

321
00:16:45,339 --> 00:16:46,900
boost attention.

322
00:16:46,900 --> 00:16:50,904
On one hand, there is a lower barrier to entry, so you can potentially reach a much larger

323
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:52,025
audience.

324
00:16:52,025 --> 00:16:56,470
On the other hand, it means that the game will be downloaded by a large number of players

325
00:16:56,470 --> 00:16:58,552
who never would have paid for it.

326
00:16:58,552 --> 00:17:02,876
Thus, many of Blackhaven's most negative reviews came from players who clearly weren't fans

327
00:17:02,876 --> 00:17:05,539
of the genre, but had downloaded the game on a whim.

328
00:17:06,397 --> 00:17:09,299
This dynamic also came through in play testing.

329
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:11,422
We had limited options with our budget,

330
00:17:11,422 --> 00:17:15,065
which was essentially just my professor's salary.

331
00:17:15,065 --> 00:17:16,126
We paid our actors,

332
00:17:16,126 --> 00:17:18,909
but everyone else on the project worked for free.

333
00:17:18,909 --> 00:17:20,530
And being at the height of COVID,

334
00:17:20,530 --> 00:17:23,373
we didn't feel comfortable doing a totally open beta

335
00:17:23,373 --> 00:17:25,515
because of the game's sensitive subject matter.

336
00:17:25,515 --> 00:17:27,818
So we tested mostly with friends and family

337
00:17:27,818 --> 00:17:28,999
and especially students.

338
00:17:29,752 --> 00:17:33,137
In the game's opening section, Kendra tests an interactive quiz

339
00:17:33,137 --> 00:17:35,661
in Blackhaven's museum gallery designed

340
00:17:35,661 --> 00:17:38,244
to teach players the basics of Blackhaven's history.

341
00:17:38,244 --> 00:17:40,167
When my students play tested,

342
00:17:40,167 --> 00:17:42,431
they dutifully read the museum displays

343
00:17:42,431 --> 00:17:44,394
and had no trouble passing the quiz.

344
00:17:44,634 --> 00:17:47,015
But when Blackhaven was free to download,

345
00:17:47,015 --> 00:17:49,796
antsy first-person shooter fans started blazing through

346
00:17:49,796 --> 00:17:52,277
the gallery holding Shift and were frustrated,

347
00:17:52,277 --> 00:17:54,718
often to the point of quitting, when the quiz answers

348
00:17:54,718 --> 00:17:57,279
weren't in the most prominently placed objects.

349
00:17:57,279 --> 00:17:59,400
A compounding error, which was totally our fault,

350
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:02,141
was that there was a visual bug that made one of the quiz

351
00:18:02,141 --> 00:18:04,562
questions misleading, but none of our students

352
00:18:04,562 --> 00:18:06,983
had ever run into that because it was never an issue

353
00:18:06,983 --> 00:18:08,964
if you read the museum displays in order.

354
00:18:10,102 --> 00:18:14,045
Finally, a challenge of releasing a politically charged game is that you're going to receive

355
00:18:14,045 --> 00:18:15,066
some negative blowback.

356
00:18:15,066 --> 00:18:21,032
Overall, we were very fortunate as none of our staff received overt threats or harassment,

357
00:18:21,032 --> 00:18:26,117
but there were certainly steam reviews motivated by racial resentment and even ones more or

358
00:18:26,117 --> 00:18:30,942
less constituting vandalism, some of which were taken down either due to moderation or

359
00:18:30,942 --> 00:18:31,963
community reports.

360
00:18:32,840 --> 00:18:36,681
Also, although in the end it's never possible to tell for sure,

361
00:18:36,681 --> 00:18:38,981
there were some support interactions where players were

362
00:18:38,981 --> 00:18:41,242
so obstinate that it was hard to believe that they weren't

363
00:18:41,242 --> 00:18:42,162
intentionally trolling.

364
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:46,023
In all cases, the best response was to stay professional,

365
00:18:46,023 --> 00:18:49,264
offer as much help as time allowed, and ignore the rest.

366
00:18:49,264 --> 00:18:53,766
All right, so let's finish with what went right.

367
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:56,406
First was the decision to trust our narrative team

368
00:18:56,406 --> 00:18:58,387
with the character of Kendra.

369
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,868
In essentially every positive reaction to our game,

370
00:19:01,774 --> 00:19:03,075
Kendra was a major highlight.

371
00:19:03,075 --> 00:19:05,417
Something that particularly struck with me

372
00:19:05,417 --> 00:19:08,219
was how often players referred to their actions in the game

373
00:19:08,219 --> 00:19:11,221
in the third person, saying not, I did this,

374
00:19:11,221 --> 00:19:12,362
but Kendra did this.

375
00:19:12,362 --> 00:19:14,203
When streamers enjoyed the game,

376
00:19:14,203 --> 00:19:16,124
they'd often cheer for, root for,

377
00:19:16,124 --> 00:19:17,646
and even worry about Kendra.

378
00:19:17,646 --> 00:19:20,548
Our student team had put real pieces of themselves

379
00:19:20,548 --> 00:19:23,050
into our game's character, and players noticed.

380
00:19:23,907 --> 00:19:26,208
Second was our commitment to historical realism.

381
00:19:26,208 --> 00:19:28,850
Blackhaven wanted to confront players

382
00:19:28,850 --> 00:19:31,251
with unseemly aspects of American history

383
00:19:31,251 --> 00:19:33,353
they might not be familiar with.

384
00:19:33,353 --> 00:19:34,994
Even for the most talented writers,

385
00:19:34,994 --> 00:19:38,156
leaving historical portrayals to one's imagination

386
00:19:38,156 --> 00:19:42,238
invariably results in clumsy and even offensive inaccuracies.

387
00:19:42,238 --> 00:19:45,481
Instead, Blackhaven tried to let both the admirable

388
00:19:45,481 --> 00:19:48,523
and infamous historical actors largely speak for themselves.

389
00:19:49,337 --> 00:19:53,321
One other surprise was that despite the game only being available in English

390
00:19:53,321 --> 00:19:56,743
and its American-centric story, the geographic distributions

391
00:19:56,743 --> 00:20:01,007
of our downloads were very similar to other more universal indie games,

392
00:20:01,007 --> 00:20:06,592
which was an encouraging sign of global audiences' interest in American history.

393
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:11,475
Finally, even though Blackhaven's audience wasn't gigantic,

394
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:13,357
our player feedback showed us that the game

395
00:20:13,357 --> 00:20:15,979
made a meaningful impact on a lot of players.

396
00:20:15,979 --> 00:20:18,582
We got many positive reviews from all over the world,

397
00:20:18,582 --> 00:20:21,465
especially from people who found Kendra's experiences

398
00:20:21,465 --> 00:20:22,626
reminded them of their own.

399
00:20:23,367 --> 00:20:28,573
One Steam reviewer rated the game 10 out of 10 historian approved, while another, identifying

400
00:20:28,573 --> 00:20:34,340
as a black archivist from Virginia, joked Blackhaven was essentially a job simulator

401
00:20:34,340 --> 00:20:37,864
for them and asked if we had read their emails before writing Kendra's.

402
00:20:38,870 --> 00:20:41,913
And despite the game not shying away from the darker aspects

403
00:20:41,913 --> 00:20:45,017
of history, many players from marginalized backgrounds

404
00:20:45,017 --> 00:20:46,238
found the game affirming.

405
00:20:46,238 --> 00:20:49,903
As Dr. Roberts pointed out, for some black Americans living

406
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:54,348
in the South, every day is, for black Americans living

407
00:20:54,348 --> 00:20:57,852
in the South, every day is lived as if in a museum

408
00:20:57,852 --> 00:20:59,113
of unpleasant history.

409
00:21:00,098 --> 00:21:03,283
Blackhaven could offer players a way to safely explore places

410
00:21:03,283 --> 00:21:08,091
they were often excluded from and work alongside Kindred

411
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:10,735
to push back against the game's fictional but all too

412
00:21:10,735 --> 00:21:12,618
realistic historical wrongs.

413
00:21:13,895 --> 00:21:17,096
As for Historiated, we're still hoping to release Cassius

414
00:21:17,096 --> 00:21:19,577
at some point, but given the positive reaction

415
00:21:19,577 --> 00:21:22,098
to Black Haven, we're considering an engine switch

416
00:21:22,098 --> 00:21:24,479
and expansion beyond the original game,

417
00:21:24,479 --> 00:21:27,340
which, thanks to Black Haven, hasn't gotten much attention

418
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:27,961
in the last two years.

419
00:21:27,961 --> 00:21:31,982
In the meantime, we'll be growing our tiny studio,

420
00:21:31,982 --> 00:21:34,724
and we're working on a small, all-ages VR game

421
00:21:34,724 --> 00:21:36,124
about Paul Revere's ride,

422
00:21:36,124 --> 00:21:38,425
inspired by the American Gothic artist,

423
00:21:38,425 --> 00:21:40,246
Grant Wood's painting of the event,

424
00:21:40,246 --> 00:21:42,567
and that will release early next year.

425
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:47,164
So on behalf of the entire historiated team

426
00:21:47,164 --> 00:21:51,005
and Kendra herself, I thank all of you for listening.

427
00:21:51,005 --> 00:21:52,866
And don't forget that you can check out Black Haven

428
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:55,407
anytime for free on Steam.

429
00:21:55,407 --> 00:21:58,708
One final thing, I'm a little bit hard of hearing.

430
00:21:58,708 --> 00:22:01,149
I'm actually deaf in my left ear and with masks on.

431
00:22:01,149 --> 00:22:02,890
I'm gonna save us all the trouble

432
00:22:02,890 --> 00:22:05,111
of skipping questions from the audience,

433
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:07,752
but I'm very happy to talk to any and all of you

434
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,913
in the hallway right after we finish.

435
00:22:09,913 --> 00:22:10,893
So thanks so much.
