1
00:00:11,303 --> 00:00:13,625
All right, so welcome everyone.

2
00:00:13,985 --> 00:00:16,687
Thank you for joining us today here in person.

3
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:17,388
Oh my goodness.

4
00:00:18,729 --> 00:00:21,290
I'm Nicole Minka, the recruiting manager at Crystal Dynamics

5
00:00:21,351 --> 00:00:23,672
and I'm gonna be your moderator for the panel today.

6
00:00:23,692 --> 00:00:26,935
So welcome to our panel, Tips from the Trenches.

7
00:00:27,155 --> 00:00:29,377
In this panel, we will be talking about hiring

8
00:00:29,437 --> 00:00:30,497
in the gaming industry.

9
00:00:30,938 --> 00:00:32,639
So there's hundreds of job openings

10
00:00:32,679 --> 00:00:33,980
in the gaming industry right now

11
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:36,182
and there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes.

12
00:00:36,902 --> 00:00:38,564
We'll be looking at this from a few different sides.

13
00:00:39,044 --> 00:00:41,026
Those who are looking to get into games,

14
00:00:41,846 --> 00:00:45,369
those who are looking to make a shift, maybe from one studio to another,

15
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:47,231
or different types of industries,

16
00:00:48,372 --> 00:00:51,355
and then tips for hiring for your own team if you're a hiring manager.

17
00:00:51,455 --> 00:00:53,276
So how I want to start this off is just

18
00:00:53,737 --> 00:00:56,159
kind of getting a feel for who's out there in the room at the moment.

19
00:00:56,259 --> 00:00:59,802
So how many people here are already employed

20
00:01:00,022 --> 00:01:02,104
at a game development studio, AR, VR?

21
00:01:03,305 --> 00:01:04,026
Okay, perfect.

22
00:01:04,566 --> 00:01:09,387
And then keep or re raise your hands if you are somebody that has helped interview on

23
00:01:09,407 --> 00:01:09,907
your team.

24
00:01:10,367 --> 00:01:11,487
Have you been that person before?

25
00:01:11,507 --> 00:01:12,307
All right.

26
00:01:12,327 --> 00:01:16,188
And then keep your hands up if you're the hiring manager, like the one calling the shots,

27
00:01:16,689 --> 00:01:17,409
making decisions.

28
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:18,109
Okay.

29
00:01:19,109 --> 00:01:24,750
And is there anybody here that's looking to break into the industry or students?

30
00:01:25,531 --> 00:01:26,011
All right.

31
00:01:26,491 --> 00:01:27,111
All right.

32
00:01:28,431 --> 00:01:28,571
And

33
00:01:30,059 --> 00:01:34,981
This is for both hiring managers and for those who are looking for work.

34
00:01:35,521 --> 00:01:40,643
Have you ever partnered with a recruiter on either side to help you in that search?

35
00:01:40,803 --> 00:01:43,605
Either for a person or for yourself?

36
00:01:44,405 --> 00:01:44,845
Not one.

37
00:01:44,945 --> 00:01:45,225
Okay.

38
00:01:45,625 --> 00:01:46,066
Just a few.

39
00:01:46,326 --> 00:01:46,406
So.

40
00:01:47,842 --> 00:01:48,822
Now we'll move on to our panel.

41
00:01:48,882 --> 00:01:50,702
So we have a mix of internal recruiters,

42
00:01:51,402 --> 00:01:53,943
agency recruiters, and hiring managers.

43
00:01:54,723 --> 00:01:57,124
So the recruiters play a critical role

44
00:01:57,244 --> 00:02:00,105
in building the teams of successful studios

45
00:02:00,245 --> 00:02:02,025
as do the hiring managers that they partner with

46
00:02:02,085 --> 00:02:03,165
to build those strong teams.

47
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:04,666
So what does that entail?

48
00:02:04,886 --> 00:02:07,787
What happens when a job gets posted as a hiring manager?

49
00:02:08,227 --> 00:02:09,687
How do you get strong applicants?

50
00:02:10,187 --> 00:02:11,608
How do you, as an applicant,

51
00:02:11,648 --> 00:02:14,468
make sure that your resume stands out from the bunch?

52
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,770
So maybe you've got interviews,

53
00:02:16,790 --> 00:02:17,811
we'll touch a bit on that.

54
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:19,513
How do you make sure that those run smoothly?

55
00:02:19,933 --> 00:02:22,395
And then maybe it's time to make an offer.

56
00:02:22,435 --> 00:02:23,576
What do you need to know so that things

57
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:25,318
don't fall apart at the end?

58
00:02:25,538 --> 00:02:28,301
So hear what it is from people in the trenches,

59
00:02:28,861 --> 00:02:30,743
and we will kick things off with our panelists.

60
00:02:31,003 --> 00:02:33,346
So first up, we have Nellie Hughes,

61
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:36,429
who is the Design Director at Xbox Game Studios Publishing.

62
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:38,511
Nellie, can you tell us a bit about yourself?

63
00:02:39,452 --> 00:02:47,399
Sure, I'm a 17-year game design veteran who's done all types of design, including game design,

64
00:02:47,439 --> 00:02:49,461
design leadership, and design management.

65
00:02:50,462 --> 00:02:53,385
Along that road, I've done lots of departmental hiring.

66
00:02:53,585 --> 00:02:58,490
I'm here today because one of my loves is just to help folks break into the industry

67
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,132
and help folks who are experienced get the jobs that they're going for.

68
00:03:02,075 --> 00:03:03,896
Awesome. It is nice to have you here, Nelly.

69
00:03:03,976 --> 00:03:04,377
Thank you.

70
00:03:04,837 --> 00:03:08,300
Next, we have Alejandro Rodriguez down at the end,

71
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:10,421
who is a principal recruiter at Probably Monsters.

72
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:11,402
Alejandro?

73
00:03:12,043 --> 00:03:13,504
Thank you. My name is Alejandro Rodriguez,

74
00:03:13,544 --> 00:03:15,605
and I'm the recruiter supporting Probably Monsters

75
00:03:15,625 --> 00:03:17,587
and the Plethora Studios within our org.

76
00:03:19,188 --> 00:03:21,790
It is my goal to support an encouraging environment

77
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:24,252
that is inclusive, professional, and respectful to all within.

78
00:03:25,093 --> 00:03:26,954
Before, Probably Monsters used to be a re-init,

79
00:03:26,994 --> 00:03:29,476
343, Google Mobile, WB for a bit.

80
00:03:29,696 --> 00:03:29,836
Yeah.

81
00:03:31,454 --> 00:03:35,636
Alright, thank you Alejandro. And before I move on to the next two panelists, I want to point out

82
00:03:36,076 --> 00:03:40,098
that Nelly Alejandro and myself work internally at Game Development Studios.

83
00:03:40,478 --> 00:03:47,101
The following panelists are from an agency, so they support studios externally. So Iris

84
00:03:47,161 --> 00:03:50,803
Moon, I'm going to have you introduce yourself, but can you also tell us a little bit about what that means?

85
00:03:51,043 --> 00:03:54,266
Sure. First of all, it's great to see everybody back in person.

86
00:03:54,766 --> 00:03:56,047
Thanks for coming to our panel.

87
00:03:56,488 --> 00:03:59,570
I'm Iris Moon. I'm the managing director at GGLocators.

88
00:04:00,171 --> 00:04:03,253
If you haven't heard of us or you haven't heard from me on LinkedIn,

89
00:04:03,874 --> 00:04:07,197
we're a boutique staffing firm and we specialize in recruitment

90
00:04:07,237 --> 00:04:08,518
for the video game industry.

91
00:04:09,279 --> 00:04:14,443
We, unlike Nicole, Nelly and Alejandro, we don't work for one studio.

92
00:04:14,483 --> 00:04:16,405
We partner with multiple studios.

93
00:04:17,285 --> 00:04:23,067
across this industry to help them fill all types of roles within the gaming industry.

94
00:04:24,188 --> 00:04:30,570
We, part of the reason a studio would reach out to us is, you know, there's multiple reasons,

95
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:35,592
but some of the main ones are maybe they don't have an internal recruiting firm or an internal

96
00:04:35,652 --> 00:04:43,234
recruiting team. They might not have the capacity, if they do have an internal team, to fill all the

97
00:04:43,274 --> 00:04:46,115
roles that are on their plate, especially in the current market.

98
00:04:46,795 --> 00:04:51,237
or they might be ramping up to grow the studio excessively.

99
00:04:51,477 --> 00:04:56,639
And so they'll reach out to us and we will form a partnership and help them fill jobs.

100
00:04:56,659 --> 00:05:03,322
Awesome. And last but certainly not least, we have Cami, who is a recruiter at GG Locators,

101
00:05:03,342 --> 00:05:06,483
but has also worked at a few gaming colleges in the past.

102
00:05:06,603 --> 00:05:11,385
Yeah, thanks, Nicole. Yeah, it's really great to see you guys in person. You have no idea.

103
00:05:13,098 --> 00:05:18,542
So yes, I work at Gigi Locators, but I have spent 12 plus years, 15 years, I've lost track now,

104
00:05:19,222 --> 00:05:23,685
working at colleges like Full Sail, working in the career track,

105
00:05:25,166 --> 00:05:30,710
helping, you know, helping coach students with resumes, portfolios, soft skills,

106
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:34,352
whatever it takes to prepare them to get into the industry.

107
00:05:35,013 --> 00:05:39,356
but also my job was to build relationships with the industry so they would look to me

108
00:05:39,477 --> 00:05:42,759
or our school when they're looking to hire.

109
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:46,642
So relationships are really critical.

110
00:05:46,983 --> 00:05:51,586
I've probably helped, I don't know, thousands of grads get launched in their first jobs,

111
00:05:52,347 --> 00:05:56,390
but what's really cool is now those grads, since you heard me say 12 to 15 years,

112
00:05:58,212 --> 00:06:03,157
those grads now own their own studios or their leadership at Snapchat or whatever.

113
00:06:03,237 --> 00:06:09,584
So it's like having your children grow up and I'm working with a lot of them now at Gigi Locators.

114
00:06:11,412 --> 00:06:13,295
All right, so what happens first?

115
00:06:13,395 --> 00:06:14,997
First comes, there's a job opening.

116
00:06:15,177 --> 00:06:17,820
So studio realizes that they need to hire.

117
00:06:18,321 --> 00:06:19,082
Now what happens?

118
00:06:19,663 --> 00:06:20,924
Nellie, can you tell us from your perspective?

119
00:06:21,545 --> 00:06:23,607
Sure, so the first thing that I do

120
00:06:23,708 --> 00:06:26,291
is I work with the leads to get to know

121
00:06:26,331 --> 00:06:27,412
the role extremely well.

122
00:06:27,432 --> 00:06:28,534
I need to...

123
00:06:30,596 --> 00:06:35,139
just like buckle down and understand exactly what the short term and the long term goals

124
00:06:35,279 --> 00:06:35,399
are.

125
00:06:35,419 --> 00:06:37,961
And then I write a job description.

126
00:06:37,981 --> 00:06:41,683
And in the job description, I have to get really detailed and just kind of get down

127
00:06:41,703 --> 00:06:45,666
to the nitty gritty to just, you know, do that.

128
00:06:45,806 --> 00:06:46,066
Sorry.

129
00:06:47,247 --> 00:06:52,110
And then once I'm done with that, I hand it off to these guys and, you know, let them

130
00:06:52,170 --> 00:06:52,891
kind of take over.

131
00:06:52,911 --> 00:06:56,994
So on that note, Alejandro, pass it off to a recruiter.

132
00:06:57,254 --> 00:06:58,074
We take your ball.

133
00:06:59,354 --> 00:07:08,565
Once the team puts in a request, the hiring manager as well, for a job opening, the recruiter meets with the hiring manager to determine the needs of the studio and create a sourcing strategy to best build this opening.

134
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:13,121
And on our side, we don't always get the ball thrown at us.

135
00:07:13,201 --> 00:07:15,783
Sometimes we have to go out and find the ball.

136
00:07:16,564 --> 00:07:19,125
But once we connect with a studio on an opening,

137
00:07:19,185 --> 00:07:22,068
we'll have an initial call, talk to them about their needs,

138
00:07:22,148 --> 00:07:25,950
find out what they're looking for in terms of the role,

139
00:07:26,030 --> 00:07:28,752
in terms of candidate, a good culture fit for the studio.

140
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:33,794
And then we'll typically request to hop on with the hiring manager.

141
00:07:33,854 --> 00:07:36,535
That way we can really dig in and know who we're going

142
00:07:36,555 --> 00:07:38,835
to be submitting candidates directly to.

143
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,797
And have that relationship going.

144
00:07:42,837 --> 00:07:44,537
And then we get out there and start looking.

145
00:07:44,557 --> 00:07:46,878
Awesome.

146
00:07:47,038 --> 00:07:49,498
And I know we had a few hiring managers in the crowd as well.

147
00:07:49,558 --> 00:07:54,240
So I'm curious to know what sort of things are the hiring managers telling you

148
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:57,241
and getting you as a recruiter set up for success?

149
00:07:57,441 --> 00:07:58,201
So Alejandro?

150
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,422
First and foremost, really, is just have a good intake meeting, right?

151
00:08:01,762 --> 00:08:03,744
At the beginning of the process.

152
00:08:04,464 --> 00:08:07,667
Really work together to have an effective recruiting strategy.

153
00:08:08,508 --> 00:08:11,411
A recruiter really is a force multiplier to you.

154
00:08:11,711 --> 00:08:14,313
And so really it's just work together in tandem to understand what it is.

155
00:08:14,373 --> 00:08:18,016
And so the hiring managers have a clear expectation for the studio's hiring needs.

156
00:08:18,897 --> 00:08:22,961
And work to have keywords or anything that will help them on their search on LinkedIn

157
00:08:23,061 --> 00:08:24,222
or any sourcing they can have.

158
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:30,925
I always like to make sure I nail down very specifically.

159
00:08:30,945 --> 00:08:34,610
I like to, when I talk to our clients or the hiring managers,

160
00:08:35,291 --> 00:08:37,314
you know, give me your top three skills

161
00:08:37,374 --> 00:08:39,076
that you must see with a candidate

162
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,618
that we're presenting to them.

163
00:08:41,879 --> 00:08:45,000
I always like to have examples. I'm very visual, so if they can send me

164
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,941
a portfolio from their team so I can get an idea of the style

165
00:08:49,301 --> 00:08:53,162
or a video that I can really focus on, that way I can

166
00:08:53,262 --> 00:08:55,703
narrow the aperture when it comes to helping them,

167
00:08:56,723 --> 00:08:59,224
helping us find them the type of candidate they want.

168
00:09:01,791 --> 00:09:03,713
Yeah, and I'll just add one last thing.

169
00:09:03,773 --> 00:09:08,958
It's always really helpful if you're a hiring manager in the audience for external recruiters,

170
00:09:09,058 --> 00:09:13,262
if you can somehow be involved in the process, that way we can connect directly with you

171
00:09:13,402 --> 00:09:17,967
and really learn what you're looking for and be able to get you the right people faster.

172
00:09:19,248 --> 00:09:23,452
And so, as you can hear, it's really important for the recruiters to understand the...

173
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:29,005
pieces of the role and the job descriptions so that they can help attract the right candidates,

174
00:09:29,065 --> 00:09:31,567
get the job descriptions out there so that people can apply.

175
00:09:31,607 --> 00:09:36,711
And then as they apply, they're talking to these candidates, like yourselves, and we're

176
00:09:36,751 --> 00:09:39,613
hearing a lot about what's going on in the industry right now from candidates.

177
00:09:39,693 --> 00:09:44,738
So some of you might relate to a lot of these things, but what do you all think are some

178
00:09:44,758 --> 00:09:47,039
of the things that you've heard candidates are looking for?

179
00:09:49,285 --> 00:09:53,826
You know, since COVID, a lot of it is work from home or a hybrid work situation.

180
00:09:53,846 --> 00:10:00,008
You need to, you know, a lot of people are moving away from the typical tech, you know,

181
00:10:00,108 --> 00:10:00,729
locations.

182
00:10:01,949 --> 00:10:03,810
You know, comp is another one.

183
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,431
There are some companies out there that are basically taking a dump truck full of cash

184
00:10:08,491 --> 00:10:10,692
and kind of backing up and dumping it on people.

185
00:10:10,752 --> 00:10:14,993
So those are really the two biggest ones that I'm hearing right now.

186
00:10:16,265 --> 00:10:19,586
Yeah, for us, remote is huge after COVID.

187
00:10:19,626 --> 00:10:22,647
The last two years, most people have gotten comfortable working from home.

188
00:10:23,267 --> 00:10:24,947
Most people can do their jobs from home.

189
00:10:24,967 --> 00:10:27,248
So a lot of people are currently looking for that.

190
00:10:28,868 --> 00:10:31,369
And then creative flexibility is another one.

191
00:10:31,589 --> 00:10:33,850
Growth opportunity is something we see a lot.

192
00:10:34,650 --> 00:10:39,031
We also definitely in this industry, work life balance is huge.

193
00:10:39,711 --> 00:10:44,874
no more crunch. I don't think I think most studios aren't doing it anymore. So, you know,

194
00:10:44,914 --> 00:10:52,658
people are excited about that. But each candidate is very unique. So I usually try to do my,

195
00:10:53,598 --> 00:10:58,361
my thinking, like listening to them, what's their motivating factor? Is it compensation?

196
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:03,343
Is it working remote? Or are the growth expectations of that studio? You know,

197
00:11:03,383 --> 00:11:05,024
what what's their order of priority?

198
00:11:08,426 --> 00:11:10,827
and honestly, really a respectful and inclusive environment.

199
00:11:11,888 --> 00:11:17,271
So, you mentioned inclusivity and I just was curious if you could tell us all a little bit more about that.

200
00:11:17,492 --> 00:11:17,912
Well, yes.

201
00:11:18,972 --> 00:11:23,235
Well, honestly, game studios are making games for diverse markets

202
00:11:24,196 --> 00:11:25,777
and in order for them to make games

203
00:11:25,797 --> 00:11:30,700
in order for them to make games that resonate within those markets

204
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,822
they really should themselves reflect that diversity within the team compositions.

205
00:11:37,482 --> 00:11:39,743
So all of this happens before the job's even posted out

206
00:11:41,164 --> 00:11:41,725
on a website.

207
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:46,288
So the hiring managers try to make it straightforward for us

208
00:11:46,328 --> 00:11:47,529
so that we can put that out there.

209
00:11:48,870 --> 00:11:50,792
And if they've got a job description already made,

210
00:11:50,952 --> 00:11:52,513
that makes things a little bit easier for us

211
00:11:52,553 --> 00:11:54,315
so that we can formulate that job description

212
00:11:54,335 --> 00:11:55,155
and get it out to you all.

213
00:11:55,195 --> 00:11:58,117
But maybe it's something that the team hasn't hired before,

214
00:11:58,278 --> 00:12:00,019
or maybe it's a new role or something

215
00:12:00,039 --> 00:12:01,620
that they haven't hired for in a long time.

216
00:12:02,281 --> 00:12:03,882
So there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes

217
00:12:03,902 --> 00:12:05,583
to make sure that what we're putting out there to you all

218
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:06,104
is.

219
00:12:07,045 --> 00:12:09,048
in line with what the team is actually looking for.

220
00:12:09,148 --> 00:12:12,794
So I just want to touch a little bit more on how hiring managers and recruiters

221
00:12:12,834 --> 00:12:16,801
partner together to make sure that those job descriptions are out there and accurate.

222
00:12:16,881 --> 00:12:19,305
So, Nellie, what do you all do with your team?

223
00:12:21,511 --> 00:12:22,512
Lots of communication.

224
00:12:22,752 --> 00:12:24,954
You know, we spend a lot of time with recruiters

225
00:12:25,034 --> 00:12:27,736
and going over in great detail about what the job itself is,

226
00:12:27,916 --> 00:12:30,218
what the goals and the needs are for the role.

227
00:12:30,519 --> 00:12:33,141
And, you know, we need to be available as much as possible

228
00:12:33,241 --> 00:12:35,963
because, you know, we need to just be nimble.

229
00:12:37,645 --> 00:12:40,007
Right now, the job market is really, really hot.

230
00:12:40,387 --> 00:12:43,830
And if you can't be there to answer those questions,

231
00:12:43,890 --> 00:12:45,131
that candidate may get away.

232
00:12:46,813 --> 00:12:47,193
Well said.

233
00:12:48,923 --> 00:12:53,004
Honestly, really, it's fine. Previous examples of these jobs clearly determine the specific

234
00:12:53,044 --> 00:12:58,166
needs of the team. For example, do you need to know Unreal? Do you have other expectations

235
00:12:58,206 --> 00:13:05,269
for C++? But honestly, what are the quantifiables? And let these job descriptions be as concise

236
00:13:05,309 --> 00:13:05,829
as they can be.

237
00:13:08,136 --> 00:13:12,057
And hiring managers don't always have job descriptions

238
00:13:12,157 --> 00:13:15,558
from previous roles, so part of what we will do

239
00:13:15,658 --> 00:13:19,219
is help you write up that job description and get it posted.

240
00:13:19,239 --> 00:13:22,159
And I'm a visual person.

241
00:13:22,179 --> 00:13:24,680
I like to see examples of the artwork, the style.

242
00:13:24,740 --> 00:13:25,680
I mentioned that before.

243
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:30,602
And really listen to what the hiring team or studio

244
00:13:30,742 --> 00:13:33,622
is specifically looking for in their next candidate.

245
00:13:34,122 --> 00:13:35,543
A lot of listening is important.

246
00:13:36,660 --> 00:13:40,522
Awesome, and I'm gonna poll the audience again really quick.

247
00:13:41,502 --> 00:13:42,582
So once the job's out there,

248
00:13:42,602 --> 00:13:43,923
you see the job description on there,

249
00:13:44,523 --> 00:13:46,383
I'm curious to know where you all are applying.

250
00:13:46,483 --> 00:13:48,784
Are you going directly to the company's website

251
00:13:48,864 --> 00:13:49,884
and applying on their sites?

252
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,365
If you are, raise your hand for that.

253
00:13:53,285 --> 00:13:54,666
All right, what about if you're using,

254
00:13:54,726 --> 00:13:56,026
are you using anything like Indeed?

255
00:13:56,046 --> 00:13:59,607
Okay, or any other, for your set monster.

256
00:14:01,387 --> 00:14:04,911
How many of you are on LinkedIn keeping that updated

257
00:14:04,931 --> 00:14:06,733
and you're using that for networking to find jobs?

258
00:14:08,054 --> 00:14:09,295
All right.

259
00:14:09,375 --> 00:14:11,097
What about something like ArtStation,

260
00:14:11,137 --> 00:14:12,999
for those of you who might be artists using that?

261
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:13,419
Cool.

262
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:16,202
And then anywhere else, maybe like a Discord

263
00:14:16,242 --> 00:14:17,303
or a forum, Reddit?

264
00:14:17,323 --> 00:14:18,945
Cool.

265
00:14:19,065 --> 00:14:20,766
Is there anything that I haven't mentioned yet

266
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:23,629
that people have done other than events

267
00:14:23,950 --> 00:14:25,051
that we haven't done in three years?

268
00:14:30,908 --> 00:14:31,049
I...

269
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,919
Google.

270
00:14:34,220 --> 00:14:34,521
Google.

271
00:14:34,681 --> 00:14:34,761
Okay.

272
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:34,922
Yeah.

273
00:14:34,942 --> 00:14:35,103
Google.

274
00:14:35,123 --> 00:14:35,464
Thank you.

275
00:14:35,484 --> 00:14:35,825
Oh, yeah.

276
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:44,934
Alright, so now that I just mentioned a whole bunch of them that once it's created and it's posted,

277
00:14:46,636 --> 00:14:50,038
is there anywhere else? Alejandro, I mentioned a lot of ones that you posted,

278
00:14:50,058 --> 00:14:53,521
but anywhere else you can think of? Well, honestly, us as a company,

279
00:14:53,541 --> 00:14:58,885
we post our roles on the Career site, on Indeed, LinkedIn, ArtStation, but really we go into

280
00:14:58,945 --> 00:15:02,828
Discord, into forums. Honestly, wherever you are at, we're going to get there eventually.

281
00:15:04,096 --> 00:15:11,742
Right. We share our jobs out on socials. I'm a social media nerd. I have specific groups

282
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:17,748
that I've, since my early days at Full Sail, on Facebook. There's a lot of great Facebook

283
00:15:18,128 --> 00:15:18,929
things going on.

284
00:15:20,410 --> 00:15:22,432
Also, of course, on Twitter and Discord.

285
00:15:23,193 --> 00:15:27,016
I have a lot of grads and friends that I reach out directly to and see if they can give me

286
00:15:27,057 --> 00:15:31,881
any ideas or contacts that they might share with me for the job.

287
00:15:32,402 --> 00:15:34,364
Yeah, friends, relationships.

288
00:15:34,704 --> 00:15:34,884
Yep.

289
00:15:35,365 --> 00:15:40,410
Usually, you know, I end up hitting my network and my team usually does the same thing.

290
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:41,371
Oh, yeah.

291
00:15:42,537 --> 00:15:44,859
So definitely a lot of places where we're posting a job,

292
00:15:45,079 --> 00:15:47,321
but I know Cammie mentioned outreach,

293
00:15:47,381 --> 00:15:49,423
and you're obviously talking to some recruiters here too,

294
00:15:49,483 --> 00:15:50,944
so we're doing the outreach

295
00:15:50,984 --> 00:15:52,885
and reaching out to candidates as well.

296
00:15:52,946 --> 00:15:55,968
So are you all finding better candidates from postings?

297
00:15:56,168 --> 00:15:58,590
Are you finding them somewhere else?

298
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:02,589
We are classic headhunters.

299
00:16:02,629 --> 00:16:05,850
We'll go out there and find the right person for the job.

300
00:16:05,890 --> 00:16:07,290
We do look at our station.

301
00:16:07,330 --> 00:16:08,731
We look at a lot of portfolios,

302
00:16:09,471 --> 00:16:11,191
a lot of candidate background,

303
00:16:11,211 --> 00:16:13,312
skill sets, technical skill sets.

304
00:16:14,292 --> 00:16:16,372
Then another great thing about this industry is it

305
00:16:16,452 --> 00:16:18,453
is really intimate in a lot of ways.

306
00:16:18,533 --> 00:16:21,713
So we've been around for three years now,

307
00:16:21,773 --> 00:16:23,453
so we've built a lot of relationships,

308
00:16:24,474 --> 00:16:26,994
and just a lot of referrals come through our door.

309
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:28,634
From people we've either worked with,

310
00:16:28,714 --> 00:16:29,455
or placed, or...

311
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:32,417
even clients we've worked with.

312
00:16:33,638 --> 00:16:36,001
So I really want to underline LinkedIn.

313
00:16:37,222 --> 00:16:39,024
LinkedIn has a great AI.

314
00:16:39,544 --> 00:16:44,088
So just to give you an example, we put all our words in for skills in the filter.

315
00:16:44,709 --> 00:16:50,214
It spits out to us, you know, a list of candidates all over the country or wherever we filtered

316
00:16:50,274 --> 00:16:50,795
it down to.

317
00:16:51,295 --> 00:16:52,437
But here's my favorite part.

318
00:16:52,917 --> 00:16:53,798
I go to bed at night.

319
00:16:54,839 --> 00:16:56,580
LinkedIn's AI is still working.

320
00:16:56,661 --> 00:16:57,861
So when I get up in the morning,

321
00:16:57,942 --> 00:17:01,644
LinkedIn has populated another 40, 50 people

322
00:17:01,724 --> 00:17:03,086
in my search section.

323
00:17:03,186 --> 00:17:05,788
So honestly, I can't emphasize enough

324
00:17:06,028 --> 00:17:08,650
how important your LinkedIn profile,

325
00:17:09,050 --> 00:17:10,031
if you're seeing a job,

326
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:13,734
make sure you weave those words into your profile

327
00:17:15,515 --> 00:17:16,496
and just keep it active.

328
00:17:16,916 --> 00:17:18,718
It doesn't mean you have to post a lot of stuff.

329
00:17:19,118 --> 00:17:21,420
It just means keep your own profile active.

330
00:17:25,883 --> 00:17:26,645
Well said, Canon.

331
00:17:27,908 --> 00:17:32,099
Honestly, we find our best candidates within the industry communities, discord and social media.

332
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:33,242
You.

333
00:17:34,264 --> 00:17:34,705
Yeah, so.

334
00:17:35,468 --> 00:17:38,470
Get yourself out there, network, make sure things are updated.

335
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:43,655
And like they all said, the SEO on LinkedIn, that's where they're finding some of your

336
00:17:43,675 --> 00:17:46,397
profiles is through those keyword searches.

337
00:17:46,557 --> 00:17:49,920
So, all right, we're going to move on to when we identify a candidate.

338
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,623
So we're going to dive a little bit deeper into the channels that we use for finding

339
00:17:53,663 --> 00:17:54,624
talent. But before we do,

340
00:17:56,545 --> 00:17:59,146
I have one last thing about those job postings.

341
00:17:59,346 --> 00:18:02,107
So, say a hiring manager, some of you may be out here,

342
00:18:02,687 --> 00:18:04,648
who don't have a recruiter, you don't have an HR team,

343
00:18:05,348 --> 00:18:08,249
what are some things that you can do to get more applicants

344
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,610
other than, you know, networking with this group?

345
00:18:13,687 --> 00:18:17,448
Well, you know, I'm gonna beat the drum of LinkedIn,

346
00:18:17,489 --> 00:18:19,530
get a LinkedIn Pro, you know, account.

347
00:18:19,630 --> 00:18:23,071
But I just, it's a job within itself,

348
00:18:23,151 --> 00:18:25,753
so you really kinda need to count that into your schedule.

349
00:18:26,033 --> 00:18:30,395
So, you know, I think I'm just really gonna,

350
00:18:30,635 --> 00:18:34,117
you know, stress that, because you, it's a lot of work.

351
00:18:34,277 --> 00:18:38,379
But, you know, just user network and word of mouth

352
00:18:38,739 --> 00:18:41,381
is a lot of it, and just make sure to,

353
00:18:42,161 --> 00:18:44,622
continue to, you know, just get it out there.

354
00:18:47,124 --> 00:18:50,146
I mean, naturally, I'm going to say call GD locators.

355
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:54,458
Yeah, we work with studios big and small.

356
00:18:54,898 --> 00:19:00,241
I mean, the small studios, I always have a soft spot in my heart because I know how much

357
00:19:00,341 --> 00:19:03,283
energy it takes to source and pre-interview people.

358
00:19:03,663 --> 00:19:08,806
So if there's only one person at that studio, you have to be so, you want to swoop in and

359
00:19:08,846 --> 00:19:09,787
help them out, right?

360
00:19:10,767 --> 00:19:16,831
But we work with big studios too, and their hiring numbers are so huge that even their

361
00:19:16,891 --> 00:19:19,513
most coordinated teams can't keep up.

362
00:19:20,153 --> 00:19:23,014
So it's always great to be a recruiter like us.

363
00:19:24,515 --> 00:19:26,456
So as a candidate, you might be thinking,

364
00:19:26,516 --> 00:19:28,437
hey, what, the market's so hot,

365
00:19:28,497 --> 00:19:31,638
all these people are hiring, I applied, I never heard back.

366
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,299
If there's so few applicants

367
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,240
and you guys are having to do all this outreach,

368
00:19:36,280 --> 00:19:37,821
how come nobody's answering me?

369
00:19:38,181 --> 00:19:41,843
So do you all have any advice for the applicants

370
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:43,524
to make sure that their applications

371
00:19:43,584 --> 00:19:45,345
are getting noticed when they apply?

372
00:19:46,310 --> 00:19:48,511
to quote our talented director of recruitment,

373
00:19:49,191 --> 00:19:51,332
make sure your resume looks like a job description.

374
00:19:51,832 --> 00:19:54,573
Tailor your resume to create trust within the hiring manager

375
00:19:54,673 --> 00:19:55,674
by aligning your experience

376
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:57,774
with exactly what they're looking for.

377
00:19:57,854 --> 00:20:01,095
Make sure they don't have to jump and make leaps of trust

378
00:20:01,195 --> 00:20:03,796
where you don't understand what you do.

379
00:20:03,916 --> 00:20:05,497
Use the keywords in the job description itself

380
00:20:05,557 --> 00:20:06,357
in your resume.

381
00:20:06,757 --> 00:20:10,759
Most resumes are first also filtered by an ATS, an AI,

382
00:20:11,299 --> 00:20:13,740
that really uses those keywords to filter them out

383
00:20:13,800 --> 00:20:14,920
and allow me to see them first.

384
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:24,005
I always, you know, I've worked with a lot of students and grads and I'm really a big

385
00:20:24,086 --> 00:20:29,312
advocate for making your resume very easy for the hiring managers.

386
00:20:29,352 --> 00:20:33,497
They're getting, they may get a hundred to a thousand resumes, they don't have time to

387
00:20:33,557 --> 00:20:34,138
read everything.

388
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:39,565
Make it very clear. Don't give a long objective. They don't give a rip what your objective is,

389
00:20:39,645 --> 00:20:45,667
right? They're there because they need to get their team up and running. So don't care about

390
00:20:45,727 --> 00:20:50,309
that stuff. Use bullet points. You want them to be able to skim that resume really quickly,

391
00:20:50,709 --> 00:20:52,750
and you want them to be able to see your skills.

392
00:20:53,310 --> 00:20:58,773
Honestly, there's a lot of stuff that doesn't get read in a resume, so make the most important

393
00:20:58,833 --> 00:21:01,755
stuff easy with live links.

394
00:21:02,115 --> 00:21:05,157
Make sure your live links work before you send that resume in.

395
00:21:05,697 --> 00:21:10,200
I've had a lot of resumes where I've tested a live link and it's taken, and I know that

396
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:14,042
person has a great live link, but it doesn't work.

397
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:17,124
So every single time, make sure those live links are working.

398
00:21:17,624 --> 00:21:20,205
Make it stupid easy for recruiters to help you.

399
00:21:21,573 --> 00:21:26,558
And I'd like to go off of a little bit of what they said to applicant tracking system.

400
00:21:26,738 --> 00:21:30,522
Make sure that there's not a bunch of crazy graphics on your resume because when it uploads,

401
00:21:31,943 --> 00:21:34,666
it's going to totally make it wonky if there's too much stuff on there.

402
00:21:34,726 --> 00:21:35,987
So keep it simple.

403
00:21:37,048 --> 00:21:37,969
And then also...

404
00:21:39,030 --> 00:21:43,053
If you are matching things to the job description, you want to be like, yes, I checked these boxes,

405
00:21:43,133 --> 00:21:47,056
but also make sure that you can speak to the experience that you have, because hiring managers

406
00:21:47,076 --> 00:21:50,138
are going to dig into that. And they're going to make sure that if you're saying, yes, I've done

407
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:55,102
this required skill, that you actually can do it and speak to it. So align it, but make sure that

408
00:21:55,142 --> 00:22:02,128
it's also staying truthful and accurate. So what about job descriptions that require portfolios?

409
00:22:02,248 --> 00:22:03,709
We'll go to the design director on this one.

410
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,022
Alright, well, you know, I guess I'm going to start kind of general and then hone in.

411
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:14,063
So, you know, make sure that your portfolio looks like you put effort into it.

412
00:22:15,504 --> 00:22:21,686
You know, flashy sites and elaborate portfolios don't mean much if, you know, it doesn't have

413
00:22:21,706 --> 00:22:23,826
the content that is good.

414
00:22:24,767 --> 00:22:27,468
Put your best stuff in there and only your best stuff.

415
00:22:28,869 --> 00:22:30,590
You know, I got to stop saying I'm sorry.

416
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,772
Take the old stuff out as you grow.

417
00:22:32,892 --> 00:22:33,733
Keep it up to date.

418
00:22:34,274 --> 00:22:35,535
Show versatility.

419
00:22:36,296 --> 00:22:38,758
If you're not sure if your best stuff is, ask others.

420
00:22:38,858 --> 00:22:41,681
Get feedback all the time, you know.

421
00:22:42,081 --> 00:22:42,822
Curate that shit.

422
00:22:43,462 --> 00:22:44,043
Sorry, I swore.

423
00:22:45,064 --> 00:22:45,604
Be picky.

424
00:22:45,865 --> 00:22:47,867
So we're going to be picky, so you should be well.

425
00:22:48,607 --> 00:22:49,408
You should be as well.

426
00:22:49,808 --> 00:22:50,889
Keep it super friendly.

427
00:22:52,394 --> 00:22:54,236
keep the career track that you are going for.

428
00:22:54,396 --> 00:22:56,658
So some of the things that I've seen,

429
00:22:56,758 --> 00:22:58,599
especially with people who are kind of starting out

430
00:22:58,619 --> 00:23:01,401
in the industry, is there's like a smorgasbord

431
00:23:01,762 --> 00:23:02,682
of things in there.

432
00:23:02,702 --> 00:23:06,045
You've got design work, you've got art stuff,

433
00:23:06,125 --> 00:23:08,567
and I think if you're trying to go for a couple

434
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:09,908
of different tracks, that you should make

435
00:23:09,928 --> 00:23:12,130
a different portfolio for each track you're going for,

436
00:23:12,310 --> 00:23:16,854
or decide maybe what track you are going for

437
00:23:17,074 --> 00:23:18,715
and focus on that.

438
00:23:23,127 --> 00:23:24,067
Oh my gosh, I got lost.

439
00:23:25,387 --> 00:23:26,707
Anyways, yeah, that's where I was going.

440
00:23:26,727 --> 00:23:28,208
That was really well said, Nellie. Thank you for that.

441
00:23:28,508 --> 00:23:28,748
Yes.

442
00:23:29,948 --> 00:23:33,609
To continue, make sure your art aligns to the work of the studio you want to be hired at.

443
00:23:35,169 --> 00:23:38,290
Your portfolio should honestly look like you've already done the work that you're...

444
00:23:38,330 --> 00:23:40,590
I'm sorry, you've already done the job that you're applying to do.

445
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:44,631
You know, and to kind of hone in a little bit,

446
00:23:44,671 --> 00:23:47,792
if you're an artist, one of my artist managers

447
00:23:48,692 --> 00:23:50,452
basically said, avoid the T&A.

448
00:23:51,878 --> 00:23:54,360
Fine art nudes are great, you know, drawing one thing,

449
00:23:54,420 --> 00:23:56,721
but exploitive of creepy anime is another,

450
00:23:56,741 --> 00:23:58,342
and kind of just don't do that.

451
00:23:59,383 --> 00:24:01,444
In design, show your thought process.

452
00:24:01,644 --> 00:24:04,486
You know, I want to see how you have solved problems.

453
00:24:05,267 --> 00:24:08,569
You know, write examples, post mortems,

454
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:11,770
on all of your examples that you're showing

455
00:24:11,951 --> 00:24:14,032
of, you know, your game design stuff.

456
00:24:14,772 --> 00:24:16,994
And it's really important to just make sure

457
00:24:17,054 --> 00:24:20,096
that you have quality, not quantity.

458
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,402
Just make sure that's, make that your mantra, quality not quantity.

459
00:24:25,102 --> 00:24:25,482
Absolutely.

460
00:24:26,603 --> 00:24:31,005
And I know some people might be wondering, well, like, how do I, how do I make my portfolio look?

461
00:24:31,045 --> 00:24:32,746
How do I know what it's supposed to look like?

462
00:24:33,406 --> 00:24:39,729
So Alejandro, I know you touched on that a little bit, but are, there should be people that they

463
00:24:39,769 --> 00:24:42,590
can look at that work on these games or the games themselves, right?

464
00:24:42,610 --> 00:24:47,232
Like, can you, can you elaborate a little bit more on, on how they can find what they're supposed to be?

465
00:24:47,646 --> 00:24:51,888
Absolutely. I mean, it'll be very simple. Just go on LinkedIn and see who is working in the studio

466
00:24:51,908 --> 00:24:56,590
you want to work at. Like see those artists that you really want to emulate or beat and

467
00:24:56,831 --> 00:25:03,094
look at their work and just if you may reach out to them for advice or if you're not look on go on Discord or

468
00:25:03,234 --> 00:25:04,795
forums and

469
00:25:05,355 --> 00:25:06,956
and just get the advice from there too.

470
00:25:07,016 --> 00:25:12,138
But honestly your work should be able to be at that caliber of those artists you aspire to be.

471
00:25:15,420 --> 00:25:15,540
And

472
00:25:17,727 --> 00:25:24,791
So we talked a little bit about you all looking for jobs and making sure that your portfolio

473
00:25:24,831 --> 00:25:29,974
matches the roles that you're looking for, your skill sets match what you're looking for.

474
00:25:30,715 --> 00:25:35,297
But from a hiring manager perspective, I'm curious too, is there anywhere that you all can recommend

475
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:38,800
that a hiring manager can look for talent? Maybe if they're not working with a recruiter,

476
00:25:38,840 --> 00:25:40,841
how can they find some people too?

477
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:45,257
See, we've done that.

478
00:25:45,318 --> 00:25:46,461
No, you want to jump into?

479
00:25:46,602 --> 00:25:47,504
You want to jump in?

480
00:25:47,524 --> 00:25:47,605
Oh.

481
00:25:48,396 --> 00:25:54,421
see I'm just like oops you know you can have your team help you out you know I think everywhere

482
00:25:54,441 --> 00:25:59,065
that I've ever worked all of my teams have been really excited about where they work so they've

483
00:25:59,105 --> 00:26:06,151
kind of just continued to pass on all the job openings to their friends they linked in again

484
00:26:06,291 --> 00:26:12,396
sorry and places like Facebook and everywhere else that you know they can kind of just spread the

485
00:26:12,436 --> 00:26:13,757
word and you know you

486
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:18,448
I've never asked them to, it's just something that if you're excited about where you work,

487
00:26:18,568 --> 00:26:22,158
that's kind of, you know, you want your friends and other people to work with you.

488
00:26:24,907 --> 00:26:30,830
Yeah, I mean, I've already said some of these. There's some great, I know not all this generation,

489
00:26:30,890 --> 00:26:37,293
you guys that are here now are on Facebook, but there's some great diversity game Facebook pages

490
00:26:37,333 --> 00:26:43,156
that I really rely on. Of course, Discord groups for sure. Twitter, we were working with an eSports

491
00:26:43,216 --> 00:26:48,979
company and I had to really source a lot on Twitter, because that's where they were. We

492
00:26:48,999 --> 00:26:53,622
try to go to where they are and dig deep in that space.

493
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:58,427
And I know it sounds like we've touched on that a couple times too, is that a lot of

494
00:26:58,447 --> 00:27:02,251
the places that we're reaching out to or we're looking for people, it's like they're already

495
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:04,553
in games, they're already working games.

496
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:11,800
So is there anything that you can suggest to people that aren't in the industry yet?

497
00:27:12,801 --> 00:27:14,683
What if they're just starting out in their search?

498
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:20,665
I would say go to events, go to game jams, career fairs, find a mentor.

499
00:27:21,425 --> 00:27:22,747
You know, this helps you in a few ways.

500
00:27:23,107 --> 00:27:28,412
It helps you network, it gets you new portfolio pieces, it helps you practice interviewing

501
00:27:28,452 --> 00:27:30,915
skills and it helps you build relationships.

502
00:27:34,780 --> 00:27:37,102
Relationships are key, right?

503
00:27:37,282 --> 00:27:38,763
For everything you'll ever do, right?

504
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:42,365
So I always say show up to any game events.

505
00:27:42,445 --> 00:27:44,727
If you don't have any in the town you're in,

506
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:46,127
start a game meetup.

507
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:49,510
There's a lot of people who probably would appreciate that.

508
00:27:51,398 --> 00:27:56,019
If you're an introvert, that's really your superpower because you can really focus on

509
00:27:56,059 --> 00:27:56,679
what you're doing.

510
00:27:57,100 --> 00:28:03,841
But when you go to any of these meetups or game jams, I always say, you know, come prepared

511
00:28:03,902 --> 00:28:08,463
with maybe in your head three questions that you can be ready to ask at any time.

512
00:28:08,603 --> 00:28:11,984
Because if you're in a situation where you don't know who's sitting next to you, you

513
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:14,325
can come up with like, oh, what game are you working on?

514
00:28:15,045 --> 00:28:20,846
or, you know, what, are you using Unity or Unreal, you know, just get the conversation started.

515
00:28:21,326 --> 00:28:25,887
And a lot of times that's a relief for everybody in the room or anybody you're next to talking.

516
00:28:26,988 --> 00:28:31,309
I also like to go to, you know, to events and kind of force myself and go,

517
00:28:31,409 --> 00:28:34,110
okay, here are my three questions I'm going to ask.

518
00:28:34,670 --> 00:28:36,751
you know, just to have in my back pocket.

519
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:38,393
But also I'm gonna give myself,

520
00:28:38,793 --> 00:28:41,696
I'm gonna meet six people before I leave this thing tonight.

521
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:44,138
So I kind of, I'm competitive with myself

522
00:28:44,678 --> 00:28:48,261
and try to come up with the six people I've met at that.

523
00:28:49,084 --> 00:28:52,789
that event. That's awesome advice, even at any level, I think.

524
00:28:53,169 --> 00:28:57,334
Yeah, definitely. So next I want to touch on the interview process.

525
00:28:57,935 --> 00:29:01,219
So what's it like when, you know, there's a match, there's a job you get,

526
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:02,921
the recruiter wants to have a call.

527
00:29:05,404 --> 00:29:09,068
What is it like when you're ready to start the interview process?

528
00:29:09,208 --> 00:29:11,110
So how does it start off?

529
00:29:11,170 --> 00:29:13,712
Absolutely. Internally, it really is recruiting first.

530
00:29:13,952 --> 00:29:16,094
We do the whole verbal checkbox, the actual human being.

531
00:29:16,775 --> 00:29:18,737
And then from there, the hiring manager.

532
00:29:19,017 --> 00:29:22,300
And then if that goes well, then we go into a panel interview,

533
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:25,924
which will be a full interview, mostly five hours, depending on the studio.

534
00:29:26,284 --> 00:29:28,106
And then from there, it'll be a hire and no hire decision.

535
00:29:29,402 --> 00:29:32,003
Yeah, and Alejandro mentioned the five hour interview.

536
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,724
That's after four other interviews, usually,

537
00:29:34,744 --> 00:29:35,624
in this industry.

538
00:29:35,764 --> 00:29:39,165
So we like to try to be as thorough as possible

539
00:29:39,206 --> 00:29:42,207
in our pre-screen, our initial conversation with candidates,

540
00:29:42,247 --> 00:29:45,448
so that we can at least skip one step when submitting

541
00:29:45,488 --> 00:29:48,569
to our client and get the process moving a little more

542
00:29:48,629 --> 00:29:48,969
quickly.

543
00:29:50,023 --> 00:29:55,865
And if the client wants to set up the interview, which happens every day, we like to prep our

544
00:29:55,905 --> 00:29:57,046
candidates beforehand.

545
00:29:57,106 --> 00:29:58,907
We go through a list of questions.

546
00:29:59,387 --> 00:30:07,010
Even the most seasoned developers or whatever, it just really helps ease the interview process.

547
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:10,711
I don't care how smart you are, in the interview process your brain freezes.

548
00:30:11,092 --> 00:30:12,052
That's just human.

549
00:30:12,472 --> 00:30:15,453
So it's always good to practice and we try to do that.

550
00:30:15,533 --> 00:30:16,654
And then afterwards we...

551
00:30:17,815 --> 00:30:21,079
have a debrief so we can keep, you know, kind of hear what they're thinking,

552
00:30:21,099 --> 00:30:26,607
if they have new ideas or, you know, questions about that company they just interviewed.

553
00:30:28,350 --> 00:30:32,556
Yeah, we just kind of make sure we're aligning the whole process every step of the way.

554
00:30:35,213 --> 00:30:37,155
I think that brings up a good point.

555
00:30:37,195 --> 00:30:39,978
What can the candidate do to prepare for the interview?

556
00:30:39,998 --> 00:30:42,200
So it sounds like some people do some preps.

557
00:30:42,460 --> 00:30:46,184
I'm curious what else could be suggested to a candidate

558
00:30:46,204 --> 00:30:48,406
to make sure that the interview goes smoothly.

559
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,587
And are there any sort of things

560
00:30:49,627 --> 00:30:51,209
that hiring managers are looking for?

561
00:30:51,606 --> 00:30:55,288
Absolutely. I mean, before anything, Kami, that's really well said.

562
00:30:55,469 --> 00:30:59,331
Honestly, as you as an interviewer, it's like much like public speaking. So

563
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:06,696
practice and hone in your interview key talking points. You should be able to succinctly answer

564
00:31:06,736 --> 00:31:11,259
your questions through your experience. Practice explaining the challenges you've had, right?

565
00:31:12,059 --> 00:31:17,263
And how your company or how you as a person have grown into something better after that.

566
00:31:21,125 --> 00:31:24,227
You know, find out as much as you can about the role.

567
00:31:24,788 --> 00:31:28,611
I've had a couple people who have just shown up

568
00:31:28,631 --> 00:31:31,813
to the interview and not even really known

569
00:31:31,853 --> 00:31:34,716
what they were there for, and that's an instant downer.

570
00:31:34,876 --> 00:31:38,118
So, you know, just absolutely do your research.

571
00:31:39,721 --> 00:31:45,266
Yep, and I'll say just some of the things I thought were obvious, but maybe not.

572
00:31:45,886 --> 00:31:52,031
Everything's been on video for the last couple of years, so look professional, don't vape,

573
00:31:52,432 --> 00:31:53,132
don't eat.

574
00:31:54,033 --> 00:32:00,439
Believe me, these things have happened, so yeah, just make sure you show up like you

575
00:32:00,479 --> 00:32:02,200
would to an in-person interview.

576
00:32:03,430 --> 00:32:08,315
So there's a couple other things, besides the obvious things, do your research on the

577
00:32:08,355 --> 00:32:14,801
company itself, understand the culture, understand the project or the company's product, know

578
00:32:14,821 --> 00:32:20,286
the games, play the games, do your research on the interviewers that you're going to be

579
00:32:20,326 --> 00:32:24,970
talking to, go to LinkedIn, again, LinkedIn, sorry, we're definitely plugging them today.

580
00:32:26,912 --> 00:32:28,093
Have excitement for the role.

581
00:32:29,222 --> 00:32:34,648
Be there, be jazzed, pay full attention, turn off discord, turn off your phone,

582
00:32:35,229 --> 00:32:38,112
you know, slack, everything. Definitely be yourself.

583
00:32:39,104 --> 00:32:44,267
You know, just you're going to be working with these people for 40 hours a week.

584
00:32:44,347 --> 00:32:46,748
So, you know, you want you want to be your genuine self.

585
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:49,229
And there's also additional things.

586
00:32:50,190 --> 00:32:51,791
Speak to your experiences in general.

587
00:32:52,491 --> 00:32:55,012
Wrap your answers up in a past story if you can.

588
00:32:55,132 --> 00:32:58,154
This helps see the context of something you've done personally

589
00:32:58,194 --> 00:33:00,255
and allows us to dig deeper if we want details.

590
00:33:01,215 --> 00:33:02,637
And play up your successes.

591
00:33:03,097 --> 00:33:04,739
This is really important.

592
00:33:05,720 --> 00:33:08,662
You have done awesome things, and you should be proud of that.

593
00:33:08,782 --> 00:33:11,325
So just brag about it.

594
00:33:12,305 --> 00:33:14,447
What this does is help me look for character traits

595
00:33:14,487 --> 00:33:15,268
and competencies.

596
00:33:15,348 --> 00:33:18,311
So just for an example, did you build a custom engine

597
00:33:18,331 --> 00:33:18,951
just because?

598
00:33:19,452 --> 00:33:22,415
This shows me that you've got a growth mindset,

599
00:33:22,455 --> 00:33:24,576
that you're driven, that you're curious.

600
00:33:26,158 --> 00:33:28,441
Do you work with artists, engineers, and producers?

601
00:33:28,541 --> 00:33:31,766
This shows me that you can cross communicate

602
00:33:31,806 --> 00:33:34,229
and you can work in groups.

603
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:36,853
It's not just can you do the job that we're hiring for,

604
00:33:36,933 --> 00:33:38,656
but how can you compliment and add

605
00:33:38,696 --> 00:33:41,159
to the studio's team and value?

606
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:41,880
Oops.

607
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:44,441
Yeah, adding value, that one's huge.

608
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:47,582
So I always suggest that people write things down the night before,

609
00:33:47,602 --> 00:33:51,323
because bringing things back from their long term memory can be really hard.

610
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:55,844
So if you prepare for it, then you'll have all of those top of mind

611
00:33:55,884 --> 00:33:56,844
when you go into the interview.

612
00:33:57,184 --> 00:34:00,485
And also, one other thing I want to add is ask questions, be curious.

613
00:34:01,045 --> 00:34:03,425
So at the end, you never want to go, do you have any questions for me?

614
00:34:03,485 --> 00:34:04,305
And then you're like, no.

615
00:34:05,446 --> 00:34:06,046
And then that's it.

616
00:34:08,005 --> 00:34:09,645
prepare some questions before as well.

617
00:34:09,725 --> 00:34:10,886
So that's super important.

618
00:34:11,066 --> 00:34:13,907
I can't stress how much you need to ask questions.

619
00:34:14,407 --> 00:34:14,687
Yes.

620
00:34:16,007 --> 00:34:18,889
And so I want to bring up testing.

621
00:34:20,369 --> 00:34:23,150
Tests can be a reality in the industry.

622
00:34:23,630 --> 00:34:26,351
Some studios do them, some studios don't.

623
00:34:27,311 --> 00:34:29,472
So this is actually geared more towards hiring managers.

624
00:34:29,512 --> 00:34:32,013
So what advice do you have for hiring managers

625
00:34:32,053 --> 00:34:32,753
that come to you and say,

626
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:34,774
hey, I wanna give a test for this role?

627
00:34:35,847 --> 00:34:40,311
I would actually ask that you think about if you really need to test at all, because

628
00:34:40,351 --> 00:34:44,914
many companies are ditching them and a lot of candidates won't take them anymore.

629
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:50,498
And you know, if you really feel that you do need to give them, you need to let recruiters

630
00:34:50,538 --> 00:34:53,580
and candidates know that you're going to give a test right away because it's, you know,

631
00:34:54,161 --> 00:34:58,164
it's just a waste of your time if you get through a phone screen and they just won't

632
00:34:58,204 --> 00:35:02,146
test it and they won't take it and you've just wasted both parties' times.

633
00:35:03,584 --> 00:35:06,305
And so what if a test is part of the process?

634
00:35:06,345 --> 00:35:08,346
How should a candidate prepare if they have to take one?

635
00:35:09,166 --> 00:35:14,429
Well, I think that, you know, the best way to do that is to understand the product that they make

636
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,952
and understand, again, the position that you're going for very well.

637
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:23,574
Do the research on the position because you may be able to, you know, combine the two

638
00:35:23,814 --> 00:35:26,015
and it would help you give you an advantage possibly.

639
00:35:27,254 --> 00:35:28,254
I'd like to follow up with that.

640
00:35:28,555 --> 00:35:29,755
Ask questions, again.

641
00:35:30,415 --> 00:35:31,636
If you're taking a test and you don't know,

642
00:35:31,916 --> 00:35:34,177
lawyers don't know, ask questions.

643
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:36,337
If they can't answer it, then they can't answer it for you.

644
00:35:36,677 --> 00:35:39,158
And if they can, then you've got an answer to the question.

645
00:35:39,358 --> 00:35:41,899
So be curious.

646
00:35:42,459 --> 00:35:43,480
Can I just jump in there?

647
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:46,321
You should never be afraid to ask a hiring manager

648
00:35:46,341 --> 00:35:47,861
and or a recruiter a question,

649
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:50,662
because that's just really good.

650
00:35:50,742 --> 00:35:52,463
Don't be, yeah, just don't be afraid.

651
00:35:52,803 --> 00:35:55,224
It shows that you're interested in the job.

652
00:35:55,835 --> 00:35:59,538
Absolutely. Really well said.

653
00:35:59,698 --> 00:36:03,501
All right, so candidates interviewed, they've taken the test, the team is deliberating on next

654
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:07,704
steps. Maybe they're talking to a couple other candidates as well about the same role. So how

655
00:36:07,744 --> 00:36:12,788
do you all make sure that a candidate has a good experience as they interview? What are some things

656
00:36:12,808 --> 00:36:18,312
that you all do personally for candidate experience? A lot of communication, give a 48

657
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:22,195
hour turnaround time on a decision if they're the only candidate.

658
00:36:23,062 --> 00:36:25,703
If they're not the only candidate, it comes down to transparency.

659
00:36:25,743 --> 00:36:26,284
Let them know.

660
00:36:26,304 --> 00:36:29,986
You don't want to basically dangle a carrot and, you know, let's just not

661
00:36:30,366 --> 00:36:31,107
communicate with them.

662
00:36:31,627 --> 00:36:37,030
It's really disrespectful for you to, you know, just for people's time, for

663
00:36:37,070 --> 00:36:37,751
them not to have it.

664
00:36:39,265 --> 00:36:41,806
And as Nellie already mentioned, communication is key.

665
00:36:41,906 --> 00:36:43,406
Just keeping candidates in the loop.

666
00:36:43,586 --> 00:36:44,726
We will not ghost you.

667
00:36:44,786 --> 00:36:47,027
We'll make sure that we're following up regularly.

668
00:36:47,487 --> 00:36:49,007
If we haven't heard from a studio,

669
00:36:49,427 --> 00:36:50,888
we'll let you know we haven't heard

670
00:36:50,948 --> 00:36:53,028
and that we'll have feedback as soon as we do here.

671
00:36:53,348 --> 00:36:54,448
We will share it with you.

672
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:58,609
And if we end up hearing from the client

673
00:36:58,649 --> 00:37:00,609
after you've interviewed and the interview didn't go

674
00:37:00,910 --> 00:37:03,070
as well as you'd hoped, we will still let you know.

675
00:37:03,090 --> 00:37:06,071
And we'll keep moving forward,

676
00:37:06,151 --> 00:37:07,711
keep pushing for the next opportunity.

677
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:13,390
So that brings me to the awkward piece that none of us like,

678
00:37:13,470 --> 00:37:15,732
is what do we have to do when we have to reject the candidate?

679
00:37:15,892 --> 00:37:21,298
Either skill set didn't align or just, I guess,

680
00:37:21,998 --> 00:37:23,159
how do you reject a candidate?

681
00:37:23,179 --> 00:37:25,362
Is there anything that can be done to make sure

682
00:37:25,382 --> 00:37:28,305
that that's a constructive learning experience

683
00:37:28,365 --> 00:37:30,086
as opposed to a generic email?

684
00:37:32,024 --> 00:37:36,670
You know, I always collect feedback after an interview from the people that have interviewed

685
00:37:36,690 --> 00:37:43,360
them and I curate it and I send it to the recruiter and it depends if the person wants

686
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:44,201
feedback or not.

687
00:37:44,382 --> 00:37:46,745
If they do, I'm always willing to give it to them.

688
00:37:47,926 --> 00:37:49,606
I as a recruiter really appreciate what you just said.

689
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:53,267
It is really important for people to be able to interview

690
00:37:53,307 --> 00:37:54,448
and grow from their experiences.

691
00:37:55,588 --> 00:37:57,708
Normally, most companies can never really send you

692
00:37:57,768 --> 00:37:58,849
a spoiler-free email saying,

693
00:37:58,889 --> 00:38:00,269
hey, it didn't work out this time,

694
00:38:00,309 --> 00:38:01,129
I want another candidate.

695
00:38:01,569 --> 00:38:04,830
But I ask you, every time you receive one of those emails,

696
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:07,011
go back and ask, hey, is there any feedback we can have?

697
00:38:07,511 --> 00:38:10,592
And normally, we're asking to go on the phone with them.

698
00:38:10,892 --> 00:38:13,312
Normally, we can talk to you about the experience,

699
00:38:13,452 --> 00:38:15,353
and over the phone we can share with you what we can.

700
00:38:17,465 --> 00:38:18,506
All right, so the flip side of that.

701
00:38:18,966 --> 00:38:20,809
Interviews go really well, you're gonna get an offer.

702
00:38:20,989 --> 00:38:24,433
So, woo!

703
00:38:24,473 --> 00:38:26,435
But before we dig into that,

704
00:38:26,475 --> 00:38:27,897
I think it's important to talk a little bit more

705
00:38:27,917 --> 00:38:31,321
about what the market's like right now.

706
00:38:31,341 --> 00:38:33,083
So, Cammie, can you tell us a little bit

707
00:38:33,103 --> 00:38:33,864
about what you're seeing?

708
00:38:34,264 --> 00:38:35,405
Yeah, the market is hot.

709
00:38:35,525 --> 00:38:36,386
It's really active.

710
00:38:37,329 --> 00:38:38,550
It's almost exhausting.

711
00:38:40,731 --> 00:38:43,974
Studios have a lot of hires across the board.

712
00:38:43,994 --> 00:38:45,415
We're seeing that all over.

713
00:38:47,096 --> 00:38:49,338
But when we work with studios, when

714
00:38:49,378 --> 00:38:51,500
we sign up working with the studio,

715
00:38:51,540 --> 00:38:57,124
we really emphasize that they're ready to make the offer quickly.

716
00:38:58,045 --> 00:39:00,547
If they interview someone and they wait for weeks

717
00:39:00,587 --> 00:39:02,469
to come back with an offer, they're

718
00:39:02,489 --> 00:39:03,529
going to lose the candidate.

719
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,912
Candidates don't have to wait anymore.

720
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:12,838
If you're a tech artist, you can blink and someone will want to hire you,

721
00:39:12,918 --> 00:39:16,321
but you can probably have two or three offers by the end of a week.

722
00:39:16,341 --> 00:39:20,365
So if the first studio is taking its time, maybe they want to do another test,

723
00:39:21,066 --> 00:39:21,866
they're going to lose out.

724
00:39:23,297 --> 00:39:27,620
Yeah, and candidates are getting higher offers than we've seen, especially with, you know,

725
00:39:27,660 --> 00:39:30,662
multiple years of industry experience.

726
00:39:30,763 --> 00:39:31,803
So be adaptable.

727
00:39:32,204 --> 00:39:34,345
Like I mentioned earlier, remote work is huge.

728
00:39:34,845 --> 00:39:39,669
If a studio is able to accommodate that, you know, some people are willing to take a little

729
00:39:40,169 --> 00:39:43,211
little less on their base salary to get that other perk.

730
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,854
And obviously that's from the agency side.

731
00:39:46,894 --> 00:39:51,177
So I'm curious for those that are internal, what sort of things are you seeing?

732
00:39:53,467 --> 00:39:55,348
you know, people are getting the asks that they want.

733
00:39:56,148 --> 00:39:57,389
We have to be really flexible

734
00:39:57,909 --> 00:39:59,550
and we have to be willing to work with them

735
00:40:00,351 --> 00:40:04,653
when it comes to work situations and salary asks, you know.

736
00:40:05,734 --> 00:40:06,374
Very much so.

737
00:40:07,455 --> 00:40:08,696
COVID has really changed the market.

738
00:40:09,616 --> 00:40:11,858
There is a lot more power to determine where we work from.

739
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,619
It's really shifted the landscape in our end.

740
00:40:16,821 --> 00:40:17,981
Yeah, so it sounds like we have to...

741
00:40:18,982 --> 00:40:25,826
We have to move fast on Canvas, and so if you're not getting the responses, feel free to follow up with your job postings.

742
00:40:25,846 --> 00:40:27,167
Be curious, ask questions.

743
00:40:29,308 --> 00:40:30,749
We touched on flexibility.

744
00:40:31,529 --> 00:40:35,992
What are some things that you all do to make sure that things do keep moving along quickly?

745
00:40:37,325 --> 00:40:41,646
Well, after an interview, you know, I try to make sure that I have a follow-up meeting

746
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:46,627
with the entire interview circuit the day after to get that feedback from them.

747
00:40:47,487 --> 00:40:53,228
I work with the recruiter instantly after that to try to give them an answer within,

748
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,249
you know, a day.

749
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:56,849
24 hours is almost my personal limit.

750
00:40:56,969 --> 00:40:59,250
Within two days is almost too much.

751
00:40:59,810 --> 00:41:01,450
And then, you know, we move from there.

752
00:41:02,331 --> 00:41:03,331
Exactly as it should be.

753
00:41:03,371 --> 00:41:03,731
Thank you.

754
00:41:03,891 --> 00:41:04,371
Thank you so much.

755
00:41:04,411 --> 00:41:06,092
As a recruiter, thank you so much.

756
00:41:09,786 --> 00:41:10,446
Oh no, you're fine.

757
00:41:10,486 --> 00:41:10,866
Thank you.

758
00:41:10,966 --> 00:41:12,907
Good candidate experience is key.

759
00:41:13,007 --> 00:41:16,007
Good candidate experience is pretty much a metric for us.

760
00:41:16,067 --> 00:41:21,069
It's how we judge what a good studio or good recruiting experience is.

761
00:41:21,949 --> 00:41:25,130
And so, yeah, for us it's really important to get back to you as soon as possible.

762
00:41:25,290 --> 00:41:27,451
And it's a goal of ours to make sure you have a good candidate experience.

763
00:41:28,791 --> 00:41:31,132
And I know I touched on being curious and following up,

764
00:41:31,212 --> 00:41:37,433
but is there anything else that you all can recommend that a candidate do to help move things along?

765
00:41:38,594 --> 00:41:43,777
Yeah, yes, if we're working with you and we're, you know, by the time this process is over,

766
00:41:43,817 --> 00:41:47,999
we've gotten to know each other pretty well, because we've connected over the course of

767
00:41:48,039 --> 00:41:53,383
those four to five interviews before and after every call. If you are interviewing multiple

768
00:41:53,423 --> 00:41:57,605
places at one time, just keeping us in the loop as recruiters, letting us know if you're getting

769
00:41:57,625 --> 00:42:04,049
close to an offer, what your top choice studio looks like, and that way we can push on our side

770
00:42:04,109 --> 00:42:07,231
to get things moving faster in the process.

771
00:42:08,841 --> 00:42:10,189
and just being transparent.

772
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:11,536
Transparency is key.

773
00:42:12,506 --> 00:42:16,009
All right, so on that note, I said that we're moving to the offer phase.

774
00:42:16,049 --> 00:42:17,651
You touched on transparency.

775
00:42:17,731 --> 00:42:19,132
So let's talk money.

776
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:23,656
What does everybody need to know when it comes to making an offer?

777
00:42:23,676 --> 00:42:26,038
Iris, you want to kick that one off?

778
00:42:26,979 --> 00:42:31,363
Our goal is to have no surprises by the time we get to the offer.

779
00:42:31,624 --> 00:42:36,068
The first time I talk to you, if you're my candidate, we are going to talk money.

780
00:42:36,208 --> 00:42:38,230
We're going to ask what you're looking for.

781
00:42:39,577 --> 00:42:43,219
where you, we can't legally ask where you are currently.

782
00:42:43,440 --> 00:42:45,001
Some people volunteer that information.

783
00:42:46,102 --> 00:42:48,824
But you know, we ask what you're looking for.

784
00:42:48,944 --> 00:42:51,045
If it's completely out of left field,

785
00:42:51,085 --> 00:42:52,867
they'll be like, that's not really what we're seeing

786
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:53,407
in the market.

787
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:54,788
Most people know where they're at

788
00:42:54,988 --> 00:42:57,010
and what they need to take a little step up.

789
00:42:58,351 --> 00:43:01,433
So, you know, it's important not to go way out of range.

790
00:43:02,313 --> 00:43:10,035
but also not to, you know, undersell yourself. Make sure you're asking for what you're worth

791
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:15,917
in the market. And, you know, every step of the way, we're going to talk about this money. Every

792
00:43:15,957 --> 00:43:19,978
time I, every time I prep you for an interview, every time I debrief you for an interview,

793
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:25,559
I'm going to ask and make sure, hey, this is the compensation we discuss. And then I'm going to

794
00:43:26,239 --> 00:43:30,482
you know, reiterating that to the client. That way when we do get to the offer, there are no

795
00:43:30,522 --> 00:43:36,126
surprises. It's the offer you were asking for, the client knew from the beginning, you knew,

796
00:43:36,867 --> 00:43:40,289
and hopefully it's a done deal and everyone can celebrate the win.

797
00:43:41,971 --> 00:43:46,434
Definitely important to celebrate and every studio is going to be a little bit different,

798
00:43:46,534 --> 00:43:52,258
but the resounding be curious, ask questions, transparency.

799
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,551
Anyone else, any other things that we want to touch on on that piece?

800
00:43:56,931 --> 00:43:59,632
Definitely, I agree with you. Starting the conversation in the beginning,

801
00:43:59,892 --> 00:44:06,034
a lot of these negotiations or just being able to develop a good offer package takes a while.

802
00:44:06,054 --> 00:44:10,515
It's not like we can just flip it over and switch. Really, definitely do your research on your end.

803
00:44:10,615 --> 00:44:13,636
Every state has different laws for when it when asking for compensation.

804
00:44:13,876 --> 00:44:16,536
I recommend you looking at those. California has a million good ones.

805
00:44:18,251 --> 00:44:21,435
Honestly, us recruiters, we can't really ask you, what are you making right now?

806
00:44:21,535 --> 00:44:23,537
So really, we're going to be asking you is what is your target?

807
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,219
What are you hoping to achieve out of this?

808
00:44:27,221 --> 00:44:29,684
And I know another part of compensation is benefits.

809
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:33,868
So does anyone want to talk a little bit about how those can play a factor?

810
00:44:33,888 --> 00:44:36,411
Yeah, well, maybe the, you know, what...

811
00:44:37,556 --> 00:44:40,977
401k? Is it matching? What health benefits? Is it pay your

812
00:44:41,017 --> 00:44:45,019
spouse? Is there relocation money? Is there a signing

813
00:44:45,059 --> 00:44:48,340
bonus? What are the what is the bonus structure like annually

814
00:44:48,700 --> 00:44:52,701
across that? Some studio, I mean, some startups are going

815
00:44:52,721 --> 00:44:56,843
to offer stock options. Lately, I've been seeing NF T's be part

816
00:44:56,883 --> 00:45:01,665
of the package. You just have to know what your motivating factor

817
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:05,486
is, be real clear and, and communicate that to

818
00:45:06,208 --> 00:45:07,128
whoever you're working with.

819
00:45:08,629 --> 00:45:11,391
And then we always get a couple of questions after everything's said and

820
00:45:11,431 --> 00:45:15,013
done, the offers out, signed, everybody's good and ready to go.

821
00:45:15,053 --> 00:45:16,754
They got their start date.

822
00:45:16,854 --> 00:45:21,277
There are some common questions like, like PTO and I've got this wedding coming up

823
00:45:21,397 --> 00:45:23,839
and I only accrue it at this rate.

824
00:45:23,919 --> 00:45:25,019
How do I take the time off?

825
00:45:25,079 --> 00:45:26,340
So that's when I get a lot.

826
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,081
Do you want to touch on that one?

827
00:45:28,121 --> 00:45:28,862
Like what's the.

828
00:45:30,092 --> 00:45:30,773
Just ask.

829
00:45:31,394 --> 00:45:35,598
Just, you know, it's okay and nobody's going to be mad.

830
00:45:36,099 --> 00:45:40,484
Just be upfront about what you need off before you get the job.

831
00:45:40,944 --> 00:45:41,986
Nobody's going to be mad.

832
00:45:42,486 --> 00:45:43,768
Just ask and be transparent.

833
00:45:44,844 --> 00:45:46,105
Same things have happened with holidays,

834
00:45:46,165 --> 00:45:48,286
like they're not fully written out in the benefits package,

835
00:45:48,306 --> 00:45:50,947
but you can always ask like what holidays do I get?

836
00:45:51,107 --> 00:45:52,928
And we can send you those kind of lists.

837
00:45:53,208 --> 00:45:55,069
All right.

838
00:45:55,890 --> 00:45:59,191
So we've got about 10 minutes left.

839
00:45:59,652 --> 00:46:03,614
I am going to wrap this up with final words for those who

840
00:46:03,674 --> 00:46:04,854
are looking in their job search.

841
00:46:04,894 --> 00:46:06,715
If anyone has questions after this,

842
00:46:06,775 --> 00:46:09,917
we welcome you to come up here and ask us.

843
00:46:10,137 --> 00:46:11,838
So feel free, we'll all be up here.

844
00:46:12,078 --> 00:46:12,898
And you can come up and.

845
00:46:15,166 --> 00:46:17,027
Be curious and ask whatever you'd like.

846
00:46:17,607 --> 00:46:19,648
But so, final parting words for those

847
00:46:19,668 --> 00:46:20,929
who are starting their search.

848
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:23,851
Any practical advice that you'd like to share

849
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:25,052
with the group before we wrap up?

850
00:46:26,212 --> 00:46:28,474
I'll just say, don't beat yourself up.

851
00:46:28,754 --> 00:46:30,495
It's a tough industry to break into.

852
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:33,117
But there are a lot of resources out there.

853
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:35,238
Find a mentor, connect with us.

854
00:46:35,298 --> 00:46:37,419
Maybe we can connect you with a mentor.

855
00:46:38,280 --> 00:46:39,660
And just keep trying.

856
00:46:39,841 --> 00:46:41,542
You'll land somewhere eventually.

857
00:46:41,562 --> 00:46:43,223
The industry needs you.

858
00:46:44,905 --> 00:46:48,570
Yeah, keep building that, working on that portfolio, keep doing game jams.

859
00:46:48,590 --> 00:46:53,777
A lot of times companies will go, we want to see what they're doing outside of their...

860
00:46:54,707 --> 00:47:00,532
work, you know, they want to know that you're still really obsessed with making games, right?

861
00:47:01,272 --> 00:47:06,957
But also take advantage of, if you went to college or, you know, wherever you went,

862
00:47:07,358 --> 00:47:11,702
go to LinkedIn. They have that alumni button on that college website and you can click it,

863
00:47:11,842 --> 00:47:16,706
click on the alumni and filter it out to see who might be in the industry that you might reach out

864
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:16,866
to.

865
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,229
They may not respond, but you never know.

866
00:47:19,429 --> 00:47:21,311
It's a way to say,

867
00:47:21,351 --> 00:47:23,774
hey, would you mind taking a half hour

868
00:47:23,794 --> 00:47:26,357
to just give me some feedback on my resume

869
00:47:26,377 --> 00:47:28,359
or my portfolio or my Git, whatever.

870
00:47:28,980 --> 00:47:30,762
But build those relationships up.

871
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:32,023
Well said.

872
00:47:33,317 --> 00:47:34,758
It is a marathon, not a sprint.

873
00:47:35,518 --> 00:47:38,960
Make sure that you keep yourself fed, motivated, and make sure to improve yourself.

874
00:47:39,841 --> 00:47:44,964
From my experience, it takes people about two to three years after school to be able

875
00:47:45,004 --> 00:47:47,786
to ramp themselves up to a place where I can hire them.

876
00:47:48,726 --> 00:47:51,408
Schools are really there to make sure you know the foundation of what you're getting

877
00:47:51,448 --> 00:47:56,091
into, but it's going to be up to you to put yourself in a position where someone like

878
00:47:56,171 --> 00:47:57,872
me can say, yeah, please bring this person over here.

879
00:47:59,143 --> 00:48:03,085
And I would say, you know, just continue to network, hone your craft.

880
00:48:03,285 --> 00:48:07,347
I mean, everything that these folks said is absolutely true.

881
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:12,950
And, you know, just be yourself and continue to march forward.

882
00:48:12,990 --> 00:48:14,971
You know, we need you all in the industry.

883
00:48:15,051 --> 00:48:19,473
And, you know, it's exciting that we have new blood all the time.

884
00:48:19,593 --> 00:48:21,614
And you're going to make awesome stuff.

885
00:48:21,674 --> 00:48:23,295
So I can't wait to work with you all.

886
00:48:23,675 --> 00:48:24,035
Absolutely.

887
00:48:24,595 --> 00:48:25,796
Awesome.

888
00:48:25,896 --> 00:48:26,596
Thank you, everybody.

889
00:48:26,616 --> 00:48:27,757
Thank you for coming to our talk.

890
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:34,946
You
