1
00:00:06,760 --> 00:00:07,201
All right.

2
00:00:12,726 --> 00:00:15,009
Everyone was like, all right, we're behind schedule.

3
00:00:15,029 --> 00:00:16,130
Let's just get to this quickly.

4
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:16,831
And I was like, no.

5
00:00:19,073 --> 00:00:21,215
OK, so I'm not going to show you a video, apparently.

6
00:00:21,235 --> 00:00:23,617
Instead, I'm just going to show you these screenshots.

7
00:00:24,999 --> 00:00:27,721
And so, the mortician's tale.

8
00:00:28,701 --> 00:00:32,942
In the game, you are tasked with the daily tasks actual morticians have in actual real life.

9
00:00:33,482 --> 00:00:36,823
So preparing the bodies of the deceased for burials and cremations.

10
00:00:36,843 --> 00:00:39,163
This is a contrast from the comedy that was just happening right now.

11
00:00:40,944 --> 00:00:44,424
But you're also attending the respective funerals for each member of the deceased

12
00:00:44,804 --> 00:00:46,925
and overhearing conversations with their loved ones.

13
00:00:47,645 --> 00:00:51,586
And there's a bit of business elements to it too, so going through the protagonist's emails

14
00:00:51,646 --> 00:00:54,387
and interacting with her bosses and co-workers and clients, etc.

15
00:00:55,148 --> 00:00:57,850
And we launched a Mortician's Tale for PC, Mac, via Steam,

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,271
Humble, and HIO last October.

17
00:01:00,632 --> 00:01:02,013
So this is the agenda for the talk.

18
00:01:02,293 --> 00:01:05,115
I'm going to do a very, very brief history of death

19
00:01:05,135 --> 00:01:05,956
in video games.

20
00:01:06,476 --> 00:01:08,358
I'm going to talk about my personal history with death

21
00:01:08,398 --> 00:01:11,440
in video games and how that influenced Mortician's Tale.

22
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:14,101
Most of this talk is going to be about developing a Mortician's

23
00:01:14,121 --> 00:01:14,382
Tale.

24
00:01:14,902 --> 00:01:15,843
And then at the very end, I'm going

25
00:01:15,863 --> 00:01:19,085
to talk about other indie game devs doing cool things

26
00:01:19,105 --> 00:01:21,286
with death and also close the talk with strategies

27
00:01:21,346 --> 00:01:22,867
on how you can also do cool things with death

28
00:01:22,887 --> 00:01:23,308
in video games.

29
00:01:24,585 --> 00:01:27,727
So a very, very brief history on death in video games.

30
00:01:29,028 --> 00:01:30,670
So death has existed in video games

31
00:01:30,770 --> 00:01:32,351
as long as the medium has existed

32
00:01:33,352 --> 00:01:37,055
as a way to punish the player and challenge them to do better.

33
00:01:38,636 --> 00:01:39,917
And since then, we've seen some innovations

34
00:01:39,957 --> 00:01:41,478
on how we use death in video games,

35
00:01:41,518 --> 00:01:45,001
from things like life systems to respawning to regenerating

36
00:01:45,041 --> 00:01:45,821
health or shields.

37
00:01:46,962 --> 00:01:49,024
We've seen innovations on how damage is displayed,

38
00:01:49,184 --> 00:01:51,346
from health bars to damage vignettes

39
00:01:51,406 --> 00:01:52,286
and everything in between.

40
00:01:54,176 --> 00:01:55,637
And we've seen different death mechanics

41
00:01:55,657 --> 00:01:57,318
that innovate on game design altogether

42
00:01:57,558 --> 00:02:01,460
that challenge the player to take death seriously.

43
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:03,261
So this can be things like permadeath,

44
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:06,903
really, really difficult combat, or the loss of items

45
00:02:07,003 --> 00:02:07,903
and progress permanently.

46
00:02:09,544 --> 00:02:10,865
We've also seen a lot of innovation

47
00:02:10,905 --> 00:02:12,366
on how we use death narratively.

48
00:02:12,406 --> 00:02:13,867
And I kind of want to focus on this a little bit

49
00:02:13,907 --> 00:02:16,228
because Mortician's Tale is a narrative game.

50
00:02:16,508 --> 00:02:18,429
It is a thing that's really important to us and our team.

51
00:02:19,589 --> 00:02:23,870
And in my opinion, it's the area of game design in which players take death the most seriously.

52
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:31,852
So most often in games, the way that we see death used narratively is as a way to motivate the

53
00:02:31,892 --> 00:02:37,574
player to play the game. So usually it's the very beginning of the game and it is your character's

54
00:02:37,774 --> 00:02:42,215
spouse or partner or child being killed off, usually in a cutscene, usually off screen.

55
00:02:42,755 --> 00:02:45,736
But there's been a lot of better ways to kind of use death narratively.

56
00:02:47,139 --> 00:02:48,880
So a good example of this is the Mass Effect series,

57
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:52,722
which encourages players to build up relationships

58
00:02:52,762 --> 00:02:56,064
with characters before they get killed off.

59
00:02:56,525 --> 00:02:59,847
And most of the time, the deaths of these characters

60
00:03:00,147 --> 00:03:02,548
are because of choices that you've made as the player.

61
00:03:02,989 --> 00:03:05,070
So you're directly responsible for those deaths

62
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:06,951
and need to kind of deal with that impact

63
00:03:07,031 --> 00:03:07,791
over multiple games.

64
00:03:09,313 --> 00:03:12,835
And so when I do my podcast, every guest I have,

65
00:03:12,935 --> 00:03:15,176
I like to ask them if they have a memorable video game death.

66
00:03:15,776 --> 00:03:17,317
And I will say like 80% of the time,

67
00:03:17,357 --> 00:03:20,219
they always bring up Aerith slash Aerith from Final Fantasy 7.

68
00:03:20,979 --> 00:03:23,861
And this makes a lot of sense if this is a game that you kind

69
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:27,223
of grew up with, because they do a really, really good job

70
00:03:27,423 --> 00:03:29,884
at handling death, both narratively and mechanically.

71
00:03:29,984 --> 00:03:34,006
So in Final Fantasy 7, you have multiple characters

72
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,468
that you can add to your party, but the game

73
00:03:37,119 --> 00:03:40,223
is designed so that Aerith is the dedicated healer.

74
00:03:40,404 --> 00:03:43,408
So most likely you're going to be using her in your party.

75
00:03:43,929 --> 00:03:45,031
And so when they kill her off,

76
00:03:45,431 --> 00:03:46,693
spoiler alert, that game's like 20 years old.

77
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:53,649
When they kill her off, it's not just like, oh, this character that I liked is gone. It's also,

78
00:03:53,969 --> 00:03:57,511
you have to rethink how you've been playing the game. Because up until now, you've been using her

79
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:02,053
and from here forward, you have to now rethink about how you're going to play the game. It is

80
00:04:02,073 --> 00:04:07,595
a really, really good mechanical way to represent grief and something being taken away from you and

81
00:04:07,675 --> 00:04:13,178
how you can move forward without them. And Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect are both really,

82
00:04:13,198 --> 00:04:15,379
really strong examples because they marry.

83
00:04:17,126 --> 00:04:18,486
narrative and mechanics together.

84
00:04:18,506 --> 00:04:20,747
And there's a reason why these games are always brought up.

85
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:23,408
Lots of games feature death, but very few

86
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:25,468
ask players to actually deal with it.

87
00:04:26,508 --> 00:04:29,429
And so I want to talk about my most memorable video game,

88
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:29,669
Death.

89
00:04:29,849 --> 00:04:32,350
And this is a game that got me interested in game development

90
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,871
on the whole, but also how it got

91
00:04:37,131 --> 00:04:39,092
me interested in the subject matter to begin with.

92
00:04:39,232 --> 00:04:41,112
So this is me.

93
00:04:43,453 --> 00:04:45,473
When I was about 9 or 10 years old.

94
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,111
a girl in my class and her mom died in a very, very horrific way.

95
00:04:51,011 --> 00:04:52,672
And it messed me up.

96
00:04:52,872 --> 00:04:55,232
I developed some really, really serious death anxiety.

97
00:04:56,073 --> 00:04:58,013
I couldn't stop thinking about death.

98
00:04:58,073 --> 00:04:59,973
I couldn't stop thinking about how I was going to die,

99
00:05:00,034 --> 00:05:01,234
how my mom was going to die.

100
00:05:01,834 --> 00:05:03,374
I developed some separation anxiety.

101
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,355
I couldn't go to school.

102
00:05:04,475 --> 00:05:05,975
It was just hell for a little while.

103
00:05:06,655 --> 00:05:08,776
And the thing that helped me overcome this was

104
00:05:08,796 --> 00:05:11,536
my mom kind of saw this behavior and was like,

105
00:05:11,556 --> 00:05:13,297
oh, we've got to stop this.

106
00:05:13,377 --> 00:05:15,237
So she encouraged me to...

107
00:05:15,864 --> 00:05:18,327
kind of ask her lots of questions and talk about my feelings.

108
00:05:18,347 --> 00:05:19,568
And she would always answer them honestly,

109
00:05:19,588 --> 00:05:20,749
which is really, really important

110
00:05:20,769 --> 00:05:21,930
when we talk to children about death.

111
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:24,853
But a really big thing is that she encouraged me

112
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,296
to kind of explore these feelings creatively.

113
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:31,039
So whether it was through drawing or writing or whatever.

114
00:05:31,059 --> 00:05:35,904
And the thing that helped me overcome my death anxiety,

115
00:05:35,924 --> 00:05:38,287
at least partly, was a Majora's Mask.

116
00:05:38,847 --> 00:05:39,148
And so.

117
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:42,178
I remember renting it from Blockbuster,

118
00:05:43,638 --> 00:05:46,019
and I became obsessed with this game.

119
00:05:46,219 --> 00:05:47,099
I loved it so much.

120
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:51,641
And I liked it because it was Majora's Mask, on the whole,

121
00:05:51,741 --> 00:05:53,461
is very, very, very death-centric.

122
00:05:53,482 --> 00:05:54,882
There's a lot of death going on.

123
00:05:54,922 --> 00:05:55,982
You interact with it a lot.

124
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:59,824
But very explicitly, I remember the villagers in Clock Town,

125
00:05:59,984 --> 00:06:02,384
so the main hub area of this game.

126
00:06:03,885 --> 00:06:08,226
They don't know that the moon's crashing into the Earth.

127
00:06:08,246 --> 00:06:09,447
They need to stop it by rewinding time.

128
00:06:09,884 --> 00:06:11,184
They don't know that you can do that.

129
00:06:11,364 --> 00:06:12,485
They don't know that you can rewind time

130
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,925
and that you're actively trying to save them.

131
00:06:14,405 --> 00:06:15,745
So all they know that they are going,

132
00:06:15,965 --> 00:06:17,146
all they know is that they are gonna die.

133
00:06:17,486 --> 00:06:18,926
And people deal with this in different ways.

134
00:06:19,066 --> 00:06:22,367
So some deny it completely, like the carpenters.

135
00:06:23,227 --> 00:06:24,387
Some people, like the soldiers are like,

136
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,847
we gotta evacuate the town.

137
00:06:25,907 --> 00:06:28,468
We'll be safe from the moon crashing into the earth.

138
00:06:29,808 --> 00:06:33,629
But some people just continue on with their lives.

139
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:36,850
And that was the thing that stuck with me the most.

140
00:06:37,387 --> 00:06:38,928
is that the mailman's like, well, I'm still

141
00:06:38,948 --> 00:06:40,769
going to deliver the mail, even if I'm going to die tomorrow.

142
00:06:41,429 --> 00:06:43,250
And I remember just being like, whoa.

143
00:06:45,311 --> 00:06:46,131
This is amazing.

144
00:06:46,291 --> 00:06:50,813
And I remember that helping me so much with dealing

145
00:06:50,833 --> 00:06:51,814
with my own mortality.

146
00:06:52,214 --> 00:06:54,675
And I played that game so much, specifically just that town.

147
00:06:54,735 --> 00:06:56,276
I just wanted to talk to people and see how

148
00:06:56,296 --> 00:06:57,176
they were all dealing with it.

149
00:06:58,237 --> 00:07:00,758
So not only did it help me get over some of my death anxiety,

150
00:07:00,838 --> 00:07:02,879
but it also aided my professional curiosity

151
00:07:02,919 --> 00:07:03,939
about this intersection.

152
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:06,361
So fast forward to 2015.

153
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,107
a book is recommended to me called Smoke Gets in Your Eyes,

154
00:07:10,687 --> 00:07:13,110
which was written by this person here called Caitlin Doughty.

155
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,614
And she is a LA-based mortician slash YouTuber slash author.

156
00:07:17,914 --> 00:07:20,537
And her book is a semi-autographical tale

157
00:07:21,438 --> 00:07:23,600
about her job and how she got into the industry

158
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,564
and how she went from being an intern to going to school

159
00:07:27,624 --> 00:07:29,946
and kind of seeing some weird, shady stuff with the industry

160
00:07:30,607 --> 00:07:32,428
and then starting her own business.

161
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:33,881
And it's really, really good.

162
00:07:33,921 --> 00:07:35,402
It's really well written and very funny.

163
00:07:35,542 --> 00:07:38,585
But it also introduced me to the idea of death acceptance

164
00:07:38,645 --> 00:07:39,626
or death positivity.

165
00:07:40,486 --> 00:07:43,969
The death positive movement, kind of similar to sex

166
00:07:43,989 --> 00:07:46,451
positivity, is the idea that the more we

167
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:49,294
talk about taboo subjects, the less scary they are.

168
00:07:49,314 --> 00:07:51,616
And the better equipped we are to make decisions

169
00:07:51,696 --> 00:07:54,158
for ourselves and our loved ones about these scary topics.

170
00:07:55,139 --> 00:07:58,482
So in Western culture, America, Canada specifically,

171
00:07:58,942 --> 00:08:00,924
we're really, really bad about talking about death.

172
00:08:01,918 --> 00:08:05,240
We're really, really bad about pretending it doesn't exist and dealing with it really

173
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,341
poorly when it does happen.

174
00:08:07,081 --> 00:08:12,025
And so the idea of death positivity is not to remove these feelings of grief or sadness.

175
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,707
It isn't like, Grandma, Dad, and I'm fine with it.

176
00:08:14,847 --> 00:08:18,189
It's just the idea that death and grief are sad.

177
00:08:18,209 --> 00:08:19,270
They're always going to be sad.

178
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:24,894
But if we're okay with confronting these things and lifting the veil on the death industry,

179
00:08:24,994 --> 00:08:28,577
we are better equipped to make decisions for ourselves and our loved ones when we inevitably

180
00:08:28,597 --> 00:08:28,777
die.

181
00:08:29,733 --> 00:08:32,434
And I resonated with this idea a lot,

182
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,075
especially as a person who overcame my own death anxiety

183
00:08:35,535 --> 00:08:37,256
through interacting with it directly.

184
00:08:37,816 --> 00:08:40,257
And this is also what inspired a mortician's tale.

185
00:08:47,099 --> 00:08:49,600
So Caitlin's story was really, really fascinating.

186
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:51,320
But I was also really into the idea

187
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,501
of creating a video game about the Western death industry

188
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:56,762
specifically, where players could directly

189
00:08:56,822 --> 00:08:58,503
interact with those themes.

190
00:08:59,191 --> 00:09:02,594
And my goals were to maybe encourage the players

191
00:09:02,694 --> 00:09:04,976
to learn something about certain processes

192
00:09:05,036 --> 00:09:07,798
behind cremation and burial, but also

193
00:09:07,858 --> 00:09:09,800
learn about the Western death industry as a whole.

194
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:13,323
And one of our sub-goals, too, was

195
00:09:13,423 --> 00:09:15,765
that maybe we could encourage people who have death anxiety

196
00:09:15,845 --> 00:09:18,368
to maybe comfortably overcome it the way

197
00:09:18,388 --> 00:09:19,388
that I did with Majora's Mask.

198
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:22,411
So in order to support our goals,

199
00:09:22,631 --> 00:09:23,672
like these goals I just mentioned,

200
00:09:24,253 --> 00:09:26,735
we needed to be as accurate as possible.

201
00:09:27,557 --> 00:09:32,502
Right? We did our research, we talked to a lot of death professionals, specifically myself. A lot

202
00:09:32,522 --> 00:09:37,987
of the things I did was look at certain procedures, so doing a lot of research on procedures, talking

203
00:09:38,027 --> 00:09:43,172
to a lot of death professionals about things like embalming and cremation. Our writer, Caitlin

204
00:09:43,192 --> 00:09:49,338
Tremblay, she did a lot of research about grief and kind of the spectrum of grief. So grief isn't

205
00:09:49,378 --> 00:09:51,320
just sadness. It can sometimes be...

206
00:09:51,904 --> 00:09:56,308
anger, it can be denial, it can be happy, it can be you talking about Netflix at a funeral, like it's

207
00:09:56,648 --> 00:10:01,151
it's so broad and Caitlin did a really, really good job at exploring this and doing her research

208
00:10:01,211 --> 00:10:05,915
on it. A big thing that we did too that was really important is that we drew upon our own

209
00:10:05,975 --> 00:10:11,580
experiences with death and grief and we made sure to explore our personal experiences with it in

210
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:15,803
the game. So A Mortician's Tale started out as my personal game that I was planning on making by

211
00:10:15,843 --> 00:10:20,186
myself. I was very lucky and I got some funding and I was able to hire a team and that was great because

212
00:10:20,791 --> 00:10:25,333
Mortician's Tale grew to be a collection of all of our experiences with death, not just mine,

213
00:10:25,353 --> 00:10:29,694
but our whole team. And I think it's a lot better of a game because of that.

214
00:10:29,955 --> 00:10:33,576
Adding personal bits of our experiences with the subject matter is very important.

215
00:10:36,117 --> 00:10:39,918
One of our goals was to get players hands-on with the processes behind cremation and burials,

216
00:10:40,599 --> 00:10:42,880
and to learn these processes in a hands-on way.

217
00:10:44,165 --> 00:10:48,208
So in video games it's pretty typical that when there's a lot of bodies or zombies or whatever,

218
00:10:48,308 --> 00:10:51,151
when they're killed off, their bodies just kind of disappear.

219
00:10:52,172 --> 00:10:58,918
The mechanic exists for a reason, but in A Mortician's Tale we're asking players to deal with that body directly.

220
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:04,823
And players take care of bodies in the game the way that funeral directors take care of our bodies in real life, when we die.

221
00:11:05,977 --> 00:11:07,619
And so in the game, you don't know any of the people

222
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:08,420
that you're taking care of.

223
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,722
It isn't like, oh, surprise, it's your sister.

224
00:11:10,782 --> 00:11:12,004
It's you're all strangers.

225
00:11:12,905 --> 00:11:15,147
And again, I think pretty typically in game,

226
00:11:15,167 --> 00:11:17,850
when people die, like narratively,

227
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:19,692
it's always someone that you know that you're connected to.

228
00:11:19,792 --> 00:11:21,454
But in this game, we've asked players

229
00:11:21,594 --> 00:11:23,457
to take care of someone that they don't know or love.

230
00:11:24,794 --> 00:11:28,257
And something that we learned when we were doing a lot of research on the game and talking to a lot of

231
00:11:28,657 --> 00:11:33,400
like Katelyn Doughty and a lot of death professionals was that it's really really important that you

232
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:36,262
spend time with the body after they've died.

233
00:11:36,822 --> 00:11:39,064
It's a really really important part of the grieving process.

234
00:11:39,504 --> 00:11:43,527
And if you're from any other part of the world, this is probably a normal thing for you, but for

235
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:49,991
again, America and Canada, this is not a thing we do. We're very much like, okay, grandma's gone. Bye!

236
00:11:50,632 --> 00:11:51,412
See you at the funeral.

237
00:11:52,062 --> 00:11:55,664
And so we wanted to make sure that we put the camera

238
00:11:56,085 --> 00:11:58,066
first person during these medical procedures,

239
00:11:58,566 --> 00:12:01,028
and that we made sure that players spent a lot of time

240
00:12:01,228 --> 00:12:02,489
with each respective body.

241
00:12:05,532 --> 00:12:07,413
In getting players to directly interact with subject matters,

242
00:12:07,493 --> 00:12:10,575
it was important for us to be comfortable in finding

243
00:12:10,635 --> 00:12:12,477
the balance of accuracy and comfort.

244
00:12:13,998 --> 00:12:15,379
And we know this because the subject matter

245
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,800
can be really uncomfortable for people.

246
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:18,941
So finding that balance is really important to us.

247
00:12:19,662 --> 00:12:20,883
And one way we do this is.

248
00:12:22,231 --> 00:12:26,053
the color palette. So I prototyped this game a couple of years ago using Pico 8, which

249
00:12:26,093 --> 00:12:30,215
has very, very few colors, and I kind of used a couple of purple colors. And when we moved

250
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:33,676
this over to Unity and made it a 3D game, I was like, I still like this palette. I'm

251
00:12:33,696 --> 00:12:37,678
going to kind of keep going with this. One, because I think it...

252
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,891
really works with like the melancholy but hopeful vibe, but I think it also really does a good job

253
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:47,553
at masking some of the grosser things in the game. So again, there's no like bodily fluids,

254
00:12:47,593 --> 00:12:52,674
there's no jaundiced skin, there's nothing gross like that. The purple kind of hides a lot of the

255
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:58,696
stuff and allows us to again like explore these things accurately without being too realistic

256
00:12:58,736 --> 00:12:59,017
about it.

257
00:13:00,098 --> 00:13:02,801
Another thing that we do, too, is kind of humanoid figures.

258
00:13:03,601 --> 00:13:05,323
All of the bodies, all the people in the game,

259
00:13:05,503 --> 00:13:08,105
yourself included, kind of have larger heads and larger eyes.

260
00:13:08,145 --> 00:13:10,066
And this is just to avoid uncanny valley.

261
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:13,649
We also, in order for us to be comfortable,

262
00:13:13,689 --> 00:13:16,251
we had to sacrifice some accuracy.

263
00:13:16,791 --> 00:13:18,172
We didn't include a lot of things

264
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:20,374
that are part of the procedures behind embalming, for example.

265
00:13:20,754 --> 00:13:22,516
The game is not a one-to-one simulation,

266
00:13:22,636 --> 00:13:24,197
but it's just very, very accurate still.

267
00:13:26,479 --> 00:13:31,080
So, mechanics-wise, Mortician's Tale is a narrative-first game.

268
00:13:31,300 --> 00:13:33,760
Narrative is the pillar of a Mortician's Tale.

269
00:13:34,201 --> 00:13:35,721
And it was really, really important for us

270
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:38,842
that everything else in the game supported this narrative.

271
00:13:39,062 --> 00:13:42,423
So, the sounds, the music, the mechanics as well.

272
00:13:43,583 --> 00:13:46,724
And so, for the medical parts of Mortician's Tale,

273
00:13:46,764 --> 00:13:48,444
we were really inspired by Trauma Center,

274
00:13:48,484 --> 00:13:52,065
which is a game series that you play as a surgeon.

275
00:13:53,196 --> 00:13:56,418
But in Trauma Center, because you're playing as a surgeon,

276
00:13:56,478 --> 00:13:59,459
they do this cool thing where the game has a timer and a score

277
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,079
and fail states.

278
00:14:00,299 --> 00:14:01,940
So it's very, very, very stressful.

279
00:14:01,960 --> 00:14:04,521
And it's trying to recreate the feeling of being a surgeon

280
00:14:04,561 --> 00:14:06,582
and having some urgency in trying

281
00:14:06,602 --> 00:14:07,462
to save this person's life.

282
00:14:08,263 --> 00:14:10,824
So in contrast, A Mortician's Tale is very much the opposite.

283
00:14:11,384 --> 00:14:12,664
There is no urgency to it.

284
00:14:13,545 --> 00:14:15,586
We don't let you have fail states.

285
00:14:16,206 --> 00:14:19,307
If we have, that was one of the biggest critiques about the game

286
00:14:19,387 --> 00:14:20,168
was people were like.

287
00:14:20,754 --> 00:14:23,196
I wish it could fail, I wish it could accidentally cut somebody.

288
00:14:24,237 --> 00:14:28,642
But if we let you fail, that is, you're disrespecting the body.

289
00:14:28,742 --> 00:14:30,845
We're allowing you to disrespect people.

290
00:14:31,445 --> 00:14:32,967
And so we took that out of the game.

291
00:14:33,027 --> 00:14:36,871
So yeah, the game's a little bit on the rails, but it was designed intentionally to support

292
00:14:36,991 --> 00:14:37,772
the narrative of the game.

293
00:14:39,841 --> 00:14:43,202
One decision we made as well is that the game has no dialogue options.

294
00:14:43,362 --> 00:14:44,962
You are a silent protagonist.

295
00:14:45,463 --> 00:14:46,763
And we did this for a few reasons.

296
00:14:47,083 --> 00:14:52,865
One is because every single person deals with grief differently and death differently.

297
00:14:53,266 --> 00:14:56,567
And so it felt really weird for us to have a fully fleshed out character,

298
00:14:57,147 --> 00:15:00,728
like a Nathan Drake character, and that the player has to kind of take control of.

299
00:15:00,909 --> 00:15:04,290
So it was better for us to create a silent protagonist that could act as a vessel

300
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,732
for the player to kind of insert themselves and their own feelings and own experiences in.

301
00:15:10,048 --> 00:15:15,272
But it also, we did this because it also places the importance of listening rather than talking.

302
00:15:15,813 --> 00:15:19,376
You're not worried about what you are or are not supposed to say, you're just worried about,

303
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:24,039
not worried, but the goal is to just listen to people and listen to what they're saying

304
00:15:24,059 --> 00:15:24,299
to you.

305
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,623
And that is a big part of being a mortician in real life.

306
00:15:28,843 --> 00:15:33,487
A lot of your job is not to tell someone how to grieve, it's to listen to them when they

307
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:33,947
are grieving.

308
00:15:33,967 --> 00:15:35,889
So that was really important for us to be accurate in that way.

309
00:15:39,526 --> 00:15:45,712
Regarding the goal of being accurate, we wanted to be accurate not just with technical and medical stuff, but also with the emotional parts of the job.

310
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:53,640
So one of the things that I asked all of our Martician friends that we were making the game is if there was ever a point where

311
00:15:54,397 --> 00:15:56,479
they couldn't do their job, where they had to say,

312
00:15:56,499 --> 00:15:57,239
I can't do this.

313
00:15:57,799 --> 00:15:59,901
Someone else has to deal with this guy, or whatever.

314
00:15:59,921 --> 00:16:03,383
And in my mind, I think it's like a gore thing or a body

315
00:16:03,423 --> 00:16:03,663
thing.

316
00:16:04,244 --> 00:16:06,105
But every single one of them responded

317
00:16:06,145 --> 00:16:08,346
with the exact same answer, which was yes.

318
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:11,448
And it was always based off of the story behind the person.

319
00:16:11,488 --> 00:16:13,630
So it was never like the procedure

320
00:16:13,650 --> 00:16:15,071
is the exact same as what they've always

321
00:16:15,091 --> 00:16:15,651
done in their life.

322
00:16:16,331 --> 00:16:18,773
But because they knew the story behind the person,

323
00:16:18,933 --> 00:16:20,874
it made it too hard for them to deal with.

324
00:16:21,155 --> 00:16:23,876
And so we wanted to make sure we were being accurate with that.

325
00:16:23,896 --> 00:16:23,936
So.

326
00:16:24,869 --> 00:16:30,635
in the game, when you start out, depending on who you are, maybe it's a bit shocking to you that

327
00:16:30,655 --> 00:16:34,839
there's a body on the screen. But then we kind of, you know, it's very ritualistic, everything is

328
00:16:34,879 --> 00:16:38,583
kind of the same, the procedures are the same, maybe you get a little bit used to it. And towards

329
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:43,048
the end of the game we have a couple bodies that, again, same procedures but their stories are a

330
00:16:43,088 --> 00:16:44,069
little bit sadder.

331
00:16:44,772 --> 00:16:47,255
And this was really cool to see because when the game came out,

332
00:16:47,335 --> 00:16:49,557
we saw a lot of streamers and YouTubers play the game.

333
00:16:50,278 --> 00:16:52,720
And they got to those parts of the game.

334
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:55,483
And even though, again, the procedures are the exact same,

335
00:16:55,523 --> 00:16:57,325
we didn't change a single thing mechanically,

336
00:16:57,865 --> 00:17:01,148
every single person spent way more time on those bodies

337
00:17:01,208 --> 00:17:02,930
than they did the beginning bodies.

338
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:04,352
So that was pretty neat.

339
00:17:05,917 --> 00:17:07,557
All right, I want to talk about the reaction.

340
00:17:08,918 --> 00:17:10,959
So we released this game in October,

341
00:17:10,979 --> 00:17:13,860
and we were met with lots of critical success, which

342
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:16,121
is very nice, but also really cool

343
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:19,922
was that we received a lot of messages and emails and DMs

344
00:17:19,962 --> 00:17:22,003
from people sharing personal stories about how

345
00:17:22,043 --> 00:17:24,224
the game really, really resonated with them,

346
00:17:24,744 --> 00:17:26,685
how the game helped them grieve.

347
00:17:31,027 --> 00:17:31,547
There's a lot.

348
00:17:32,776 --> 00:17:36,557
how the game helped them make decisions after they played the game and then someone died,

349
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:41,018
and the game helped them make decisions regarding those processes, or how to support someone who

350
00:17:41,038 --> 00:17:45,440
was grieving. And a lot of people messaged us saying how they deal with death anxiety and

351
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,521
how the game has helped them kind of overcome it a little bit, which is really cool. Also,

352
00:17:49,541 --> 00:17:53,662
a lot of fan art and cosplay, which I'm a big fan of, so that's pretty neat.

353
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:57,203
When we made the game, we expected no one to like it. It's super niche, we understand,

354
00:17:57,623 --> 00:18:00,344
but it's really cool that players are interested in the subject matter.

355
00:18:00,791 --> 00:18:02,591
that they're interested in exploring their own feelings

356
00:18:02,651 --> 00:18:06,433
about it, and that the design decisions we made

357
00:18:06,453 --> 00:18:08,073
are having a positive impact on people.

358
00:18:08,673 --> 00:18:11,054
And we are not the only ones who are innovating

359
00:18:11,094 --> 00:18:12,334
on how death is used in games.

360
00:18:18,376 --> 00:18:21,877
So I think indie developers in particular

361
00:18:21,937 --> 00:18:23,697
are doing some really, really cool things with death.

362
00:18:24,558 --> 00:18:26,498
Thinking outside how we traditionally

363
00:18:26,558 --> 00:18:29,099
use death in games, bringing their own experiences

364
00:18:29,139 --> 00:18:29,639
to the table.

365
00:18:30,433 --> 00:18:32,754
sharing stories from a variety of cultural backgrounds.

366
00:18:34,235 --> 00:18:36,936
Here's some recent examples.

367
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,197
We've seen lots of really cool innovations

368
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:41,178
on the narrative side, whether it's thematically

369
00:18:41,358 --> 00:18:43,399
via Night in the Woods or Speed Dating for Ghosts,

370
00:18:43,939 --> 00:18:46,860
or very explicitly like The Graveyard and The Walking Dead.

371
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,182
There's a lot of games that combine narrative

372
00:18:50,242 --> 00:18:52,583
with interesting mechanics to create immersive experiences

373
00:18:52,743 --> 00:18:53,483
with death and grief.

374
00:18:56,083 --> 00:18:58,326
There are games that are exploring new mechanics,

375
00:18:58,746 --> 00:19:01,389
and in the case of E-Valkyrie, new mediums like VR.

376
00:19:04,532 --> 00:19:05,853
And we're seeing lots of games

377
00:19:05,873 --> 00:19:07,314
that are using existing mechanics

378
00:19:07,715 --> 00:19:09,917
to tell stories about death and grief,

379
00:19:10,257 --> 00:19:12,780
genocide, family legacy, or even horror.

380
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:16,844
These are just a few examples.

381
00:19:16,884 --> 00:19:18,705
There's lots more games that I could have included in here.

382
00:19:19,629 --> 00:19:22,310
All of these games deal with death in their own unique ways,

383
00:19:22,711 --> 00:19:24,071
and they're very popular with players,

384
00:19:24,091 --> 00:19:25,632
and they're really, really good and powerful

385
00:19:25,673 --> 00:19:28,414
because they each use death mechanics that best

386
00:19:28,694 --> 00:19:30,616
suit their respective games.

387
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:34,078
So how can you do the same?

388
00:19:34,338 --> 00:19:35,739
If you're interested in using death in your games,

389
00:19:35,859 --> 00:19:37,740
what is the best way that you can use it for your game?

390
00:19:39,361 --> 00:19:41,183
So like I mentioned, it's important to talk about

391
00:19:41,263 --> 00:19:46,126
and think about what death best fits your personal game.

392
00:19:47,226 --> 00:19:49,108
If your game is mechanics first.

393
00:19:50,615 --> 00:19:55,778
like a roguelike or FPS, everything else in your game should support it and should include narrative.

394
00:19:55,879 --> 00:19:58,460
So Guacamelee is a fantastic example of this, right?

395
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:02,003
And one of the big mechanics in Guacamelee is you're shifting between two worlds,

396
00:20:02,023 --> 00:20:05,045
and there's a lot of combat mechanics that are really interesting about that.

397
00:20:05,506 --> 00:20:09,709
So the narrative, which is, you know, flipping between the world of the living and world of the dead,

398
00:20:09,949 --> 00:20:13,552
fits very nicely with that, and the aesthetic looks very cool too.

399
00:20:13,592 --> 00:20:17,595
The sound design changes when you flip over. Everything supports that mechanic really well.

400
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:21,382
If your game is narrative first, if the pillar of your game

401
00:20:21,583 --> 00:20:23,024
is narrative, like a mortician's tale,

402
00:20:24,004 --> 00:20:26,606
whether it's a visual novel or a first person narrative game,

403
00:20:26,846 --> 00:20:28,568
everything else in your game should support that.

404
00:20:28,888 --> 00:20:32,150
So Edith Finch, fantastic example of this, right?

405
00:20:32,250 --> 00:20:34,792
Edith Finch mechanics do a really, really good job

406
00:20:34,952 --> 00:20:36,753
at getting the player to directly interact

407
00:20:36,793 --> 00:20:37,514
with different deaths.

408
00:20:37,774 --> 00:20:38,695
They do a really good job with that.

409
00:20:40,286 --> 00:20:43,067
And make sure that you're not just relying on traditional death mechanics.

410
00:20:43,187 --> 00:20:45,868
They're fine, you know, respawning exists for a reason,

411
00:20:46,068 --> 00:20:49,588
life systems exist for a reason, but it's really important

412
00:20:49,608 --> 00:20:53,209
that you figure out what best suits your game's design.

413
00:20:54,550 --> 00:20:59,551
And as much as I'm like, death is great, how are you guys using it in your games?

414
00:20:59,671 --> 00:21:03,372
It's also important to think about, is death even necessary in your game?

415
00:21:03,392 --> 00:21:06,213
If you're making a game like Animal Crossing, do you need to have death in it?

416
00:21:06,253 --> 00:21:07,913
Does it support what Animal Crossing's doing?

417
00:21:08,653 --> 00:21:09,273
Just think about that.

418
00:21:11,112 --> 00:21:16,916
Specifically, if you are working with death the way that we kind of did, it's really,

419
00:21:16,956 --> 00:21:19,218
really important for you to do your research and consult.

420
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:22,961
Do interviews, do consultations.

421
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:25,203
The internet can be a really good resource.

422
00:21:26,183 --> 00:21:30,026
There was a lot of really gross stuff that we found when I was doing research for Martician's

423
00:21:30,046 --> 00:21:32,428
Tale, so just be careful if you're squeamish.

424
00:21:33,229 --> 00:21:35,230
But really, really importantly is to be.

425
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:39,557
respectful. That is the most important thing, not just with dealing with dead bodies,

426
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:45,105
but also with how other cultures are treating death. If you're interested in exploring that,

427
00:21:45,626 --> 00:21:47,910
make sure that you are consulting and paying your consultants.

428
00:21:50,377 --> 00:21:56,203
And if you're again exploring death kind of explicitly, make sure that you're understanding with, being understanding with your players,

429
00:21:56,243 --> 00:21:59,025
especially like for very, very personal games like A Mortician's Tale.

430
00:21:59,886 --> 00:22:06,572
Death and grief is a very hard for a lot of people, and so it's really important to kind of think about and make adjustments as necessary.

431
00:22:06,592 --> 00:22:08,554
A really good also,

432
00:22:10,355 --> 00:22:13,318
understanding, understanding play testing is not indicative of final play session.

433
00:22:14,539 --> 00:22:17,620
I talked to Ian Dallas, who's the creative director of Edith Finch,

434
00:22:18,200 --> 00:22:21,321
on one of my podcast episodes, and he told me a story about how

435
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:25,622
during playtesting, people would be like, this game's great, this is cool.

436
00:22:26,222 --> 00:22:30,043
And the same people would go home and then message him and be like, I bawled my eyes out.

437
00:22:30,063 --> 00:22:31,364
And he was like, why didn't you cry here?

438
00:22:32,024 --> 00:22:35,825
So if you're playtesting your games, understand...

439
00:22:35,845 --> 00:22:37,625
I don't think he actually said that, but my brain...

440
00:22:40,751 --> 00:22:43,773
If you're playtesting your game and you're not getting the response you want, you're not like,

441
00:22:43,793 --> 00:22:48,537
is this game sad enough? Understand that playing games by yourself is very different than playing

442
00:22:48,557 --> 00:22:55,122
games when someone's standing over your shoulder watching you. Death is really personal. And it's

443
00:22:55,182 --> 00:22:59,265
really important that, again, if you're dealing with death, that you assess your own feelings,

444
00:22:59,345 --> 00:23:03,247
because it can be really hard as a developer to work on these games for two or three years.

445
00:23:05,097 --> 00:23:09,018
it's really, really important to be comfortable when you're having discussions or doing research,

446
00:23:09,058 --> 00:23:13,779
etc., and making sure that not just you, but your team is also comfortable with the subject matter.

447
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:19,101
Our sound designer, Jen Costa, did a lot of research to make sure the sounds were accurate,

448
00:23:19,201 --> 00:23:23,022
and she had to listen to hours and hours of embalming music. If she was not comfortable

449
00:23:23,042 --> 00:23:27,104
with that, the game would have been very, very different. So it's really, really important that

450
00:23:27,124 --> 00:23:33,446
if you want to explore this topic as deeply as we did, that you're just somewhat comfortable with it.

451
00:23:35,187 --> 00:23:36,168
And self-care is important.

452
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:37,769
Whether you're making a game about death

453
00:23:37,909 --> 00:23:39,970
or just a very, very gory game or whatever,

454
00:23:39,990 --> 00:23:42,111
it's really important to kind of take a step back sometimes

455
00:23:42,171 --> 00:23:43,632
and just be away from it.

456
00:23:43,832 --> 00:23:46,834
And self-care can be things like having a bath

457
00:23:47,214 --> 00:23:49,416
or going for a run, or if you're me,

458
00:23:49,516 --> 00:23:50,696
it's watching Riverdale.

459
00:23:52,377 --> 00:23:53,098
It's a terrible show.

460
00:23:53,678 --> 00:23:55,319
I love it so much, it's so good.

461
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,341
And if you're, very importantly,

462
00:23:58,381 --> 00:24:02,003
if you're not a person who is comfortable with death.

463
00:24:02,728 --> 00:24:06,969
maybe consider exploring those feelings about it. If you're not comfortable with it, you know,

464
00:24:07,189 --> 00:24:12,330
consider making a game about those feelings because it can be very therapeutic. Ultimately,

465
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:16,892
developing Mortician's Tale has changed me for the better. I've learned so much from it and

466
00:24:16,912 --> 00:24:22,133
I've taken those experiences with me when people I know have died. And so I hope if you decide to

467
00:24:22,173 --> 00:24:26,794
explore this topic that it can be as therapeutic for you as it was for me. Thank you so much.

468
00:24:32,549 --> 00:24:32,674
Hmm
