00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:07,538
My name is Brian Francis. I am a contributing editor at Gamasutra.com. I am a community manager with GDC.

2
00:00:07,918 --> 00:00:14,146
I am the invisible voice inside your head who just realized he needs to tweak the volume on something and I'm going to do that.

3
00:00:14,847 --> 00:00:17,931
But we are here today playing a game called Dauntless. It's been out...

4
00:00:19,693 --> 00:00:23,096
In playable for a bit, but it just launched formally back in May.

5
00:00:23,136 --> 00:00:26,278
We are playing it on PS4 today.

6
00:00:27,259 --> 00:00:32,163
We are playing Dauntless because we have the opportunity today to talk to some fine folks from Phoenix Labs

7
00:00:32,604 --> 00:00:34,005
about the game's design and development.

8
00:00:34,926 --> 00:00:37,668
Those fine folks from Phoenix Labs are in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

9
00:00:37,688 --> 00:00:39,009
They will be taking your questions.

10
00:00:39,710 --> 00:00:41,691
I'm going to quickly go queue up for something.

11
00:00:41,751 --> 00:00:44,894
While I queue up, I need to introduce one other face in that corner

12
00:00:45,755 --> 00:00:48,577
because he's here and deserves to be acknowledged for his time.

13
00:00:49,017 --> 00:00:53,901
Alex, how are you doing? Uh, how's it going? You know, how are you doing? I'm doing all right. You

14
00:00:53,921 --> 00:00:57,665
don't need to acknowledge me. You just need to pay me. Other than that, I'm all about it. But I don't

15
00:00:57,705 --> 00:01:02,489
pay you, Alex. That's true. No, I'm paid by the fine folks behind Game Developers Conference,

16
00:01:02,509 --> 00:01:06,112
gamasutra.com, and a number of other fine properties. My name is Alex Farrar. I'm a

17
00:01:06,152 --> 00:01:10,795
contributing editor at gamasutra.com, and I work here with Brian on this fantastic GDC Twitch

18
00:01:10,815 --> 00:01:14,518
channel. But more importantly, you want to know about who our guests are. So I guess this is

19
00:01:14,559 --> 00:01:15,960
going to be tricky because you're all...

20
00:01:16,865 --> 00:01:19,506
Let's try to start here on my left.

21
00:01:20,426 --> 00:01:21,106
I think with Hunter.

22
00:01:21,146 --> 00:01:23,207
You just pointed towards an empty audience.

23
00:01:23,227 --> 00:01:23,967
You just pointed to no one.

24
00:01:24,027 --> 00:01:24,947
Hunter, how are you doing?

25
00:01:25,487 --> 00:01:26,227
I'm doing great.

26
00:01:26,547 --> 00:01:27,168
How are you guys?

27
00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:27,448
Good.

28
00:01:27,468 --> 00:01:28,868
Could you introduce yourself for us, please?

29
00:01:28,928 --> 00:01:30,168
I'm sure the audience knows you.

30
00:01:30,669 --> 00:01:31,609
Yeah, my name's Hunter Howe.

31
00:01:31,629 --> 00:01:34,990
I am the design director at Phoenix Labs working on Dauntless.

32
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:36,430
Nice.

33
00:01:36,690 --> 00:01:37,950
And then below you, we have Nick.

34
00:01:39,131 --> 00:01:39,611
Hey, everyone.

35
00:01:39,791 --> 00:01:41,932
I'm Nick, director of marketing here at Phoenix Labs.

36
00:01:43,714 --> 00:01:48,157
Uh, thank you for joining us. And Andy is also hanging out with us in the call. Andy, how are you doing?

37
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:52,180
I'm great, yeah. I'm Andy Burt. I am the head of PR here at Phoenix Labs.

38
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:58,083
Um, kind of a question for Hunter and Nick, although Nick, you just said you've been around a while, so you, maybe you'd like to explain it.

39
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:03,387
Could you explain, um, I think this is an interesting case where Dauntless has grown with Phoenix Labs as a company.

40
00:02:03,447 --> 00:02:10,051
It's kind of a case where, uh, it feels a lot like when we were streaming Astroneer, and like, something that they said on that stream was we basically built the company.

41
00:02:10,731 --> 00:02:15,674
Like to build the game in a specific way where they were talking about like the team the tech the engineering

42
00:02:16,415 --> 00:02:18,196
Could you explain the origins of Phoenix Labs?

43
00:02:18,336 --> 00:02:22,939
And why you decided to make a game why you all decided to get into the dauntless business, I guess

44
00:02:23,839 --> 00:02:25,500
Yeah for sure. So we've been

45
00:02:26,281 --> 00:02:31,284
Making games together albeit not at Phoenix Labs for better part of a decade

46
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:36,027
Myself Jesse Sean Robin the co-founders bunch of other folks here

47
00:02:36,887 --> 00:02:40,029
Have all collaborated on franchises like Mass Effect

48
00:02:41,345 --> 00:02:51,610
The first thing that we did was we created a new game and a new experience that brought people together.

49
00:02:53,191 --> 00:02:58,654
Point in case we didn't actually have Dauntless as a concept when we started the studio,

50
00:02:59,414 --> 00:03:03,096
we had this vision and this philosophy that games bring people together,

51
00:03:03,196 --> 00:03:05,877
and shared experiences bring people together.

52
00:03:06,417 --> 00:03:09,159
We were just talking about the early days of World of Warcraft.

53
00:03:10,283 --> 00:03:14,744
Those great moments where you walk through Stormwind and there's this Onyxia head mounted,

54
00:03:14,824 --> 00:03:21,566
or like Guild First defeating a raid, like capturing those awesome moments was something

55
00:03:21,586 --> 00:03:22,406
that we wanted to do.

56
00:03:23,406 --> 00:03:25,807
And from there we had a couple different concepts.

57
00:03:27,287 --> 00:03:32,068
Coincidentally at the time we were playing, I think it was Monster Hunter 4 for you at

58
00:03:32,088 --> 00:03:38,790
the time, and we were all really enjoying it, but really not enjoying trying to get

59
00:03:39,339 --> 00:03:44,704
The shared experience aspect going together on the DS form factor, and we saw the opportunity

60
00:03:44,824 --> 00:03:46,605
to create Dauntless.

61
00:03:47,286 --> 00:03:52,670
And from there, I mean, it's been a living, breathing game for multiple years now.

62
00:03:53,971 --> 00:03:57,434
And it's just been a lot of iteration, a lot of patching, a lot of feedback from the community

63
00:03:57,454 --> 00:04:01,117
to help improve the game experience into what you're playing today.

64
00:04:02,565 --> 00:04:07,467
Yeah, real quick for anyone watching, this is mainly about game development, game design.

65
00:04:07,507 --> 00:04:10,968
So if you have any questions for the developers about anything about Dauntless,

66
00:04:10,988 --> 00:04:13,528
specifically about its design and development, just put them in chat.

67
00:04:13,568 --> 00:04:14,609
We'll relay them.

68
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:18,570
I want to know a bit about the networking side of this thing.

69
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:20,971
I mean, that's sort of the most exciting part about Dauntless is

70
00:04:21,291 --> 00:04:23,631
there's been a lot of press around the game being one of the very first,

71
00:04:23,671 --> 00:04:28,853
if not the first, cross platform, like fully, you know, progression tracking.

72
00:04:29,969 --> 00:04:35,534
online game for PS4 and Xbox One PC and everything else. I'm curious to know a bit about how that

73
00:04:35,574 --> 00:04:40,518
came to be and sort of how did you think about designing the network systems based on your

74
00:04:40,558 --> 00:04:47,483
experience with games like Monster Hunter? Yeah I mean it's a great question and as soon as we

75
00:04:47,523 --> 00:04:53,868
basically had our what we call the vertical slice experience of Dauntless so like pick a weapon,

76
00:04:54,309 --> 00:04:56,090
fight a behemoth, rinse repeat.

77
00:04:58,047 --> 00:05:04,910
The first thing, like one of the first things we did was get it off of running on a local machine here and get it running on servers online.

78
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,611
And I think it was 2000 and... oh, what year are we in? 19.

79
00:05:10,852 --> 00:05:12,232
So it's either 2014, 2015.

80
00:05:13,292 --> 00:05:18,574
One of the first playtests we did was over the holiday break in December.

81
00:05:19,174 --> 00:05:24,756
And we set a goal upon ourselves that we were all going to leave the office, we were all going to go home to our families for a couple weeks.

82
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:29,975
But we wanted to play the game, and we had to have things like your inventory,

83
00:05:30,316 --> 00:05:33,677
quest and progression, the different behemoth hunts,

84
00:05:33,757 --> 00:05:38,200
all of it running on servers online through cloud computing

85
00:05:38,260 --> 00:05:42,402
so that we could effectively do that and not have to be in the office.

86
00:05:42,462 --> 00:05:46,744
So kind of since like really early on, Dauntless has been a quotey fingers

87
00:05:46,824 --> 00:05:50,266
live game, even if it hasn't been like open access to,

88
00:05:50,406 --> 00:05:51,947
you know, the public in the early years.

89
00:05:52,507 --> 00:05:53,708
Yeah. So that was.

90
00:05:54,317 --> 00:05:57,298
Sorry, go ahead. I'm just curious what you specifically mean by cloud computing.

91
00:05:57,838 --> 00:06:05,341
Yeah, so we use a combination of cloud services like Google and like Amazon, you know, like AWS

92
00:06:05,441 --> 00:06:14,105
to do things like matchmaking, player inventories, the game data itself, progression, like these are

93
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:19,747
all kind of like workers running around in the background that are running on servers not stored

94
00:06:19,787 --> 00:06:20,828
inside our four walls.

95
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:25,355
So that we can offer the game effectively, like, worldwide.

96
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,256
You know, kind of a limitation of having, like, the data center

97
00:06:30,776 --> 00:06:32,356
is that everyone has to come to you.

98
00:06:33,176 --> 00:06:35,517
And it was important to us that we go to the players.

99
00:06:36,097 --> 00:06:39,758
So we have servers in North America, South America,

100
00:06:39,858 --> 00:06:42,458
Western, Eastern Europe, Australia, kind of, like,

101
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:45,019
strategically situated all over the world,

102
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,819
so that no matter where you are,

103
00:06:46,879 --> 00:06:48,939
you get a really good connection to Dauntless

104
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,040
and can play it with your friends.

105
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:53,911
Nice. There's some good questions in the chat and I want to get to them, but real quick

106
00:06:54,391 --> 00:06:58,753
before we get off this, tell me, were there any... what sort of unique challenges do you run into

107
00:06:58,773 --> 00:07:02,735
when you're trying to build a system like that that runs server-side and tracks things like

108
00:07:02,775 --> 00:07:06,617
inventory across... like it seems all account-tied, right? It's all tied to a person's account

109
00:07:06,657 --> 00:07:10,778
regardless of platform. Was that specifically challenging in any interesting way to try and

110
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:12,459
get that working across all these different platforms?

111
00:07:13,017 --> 00:07:18,639
Yeah, I mean, it would be a great question for our tech director who's unfortunately not with us today, but...

112
00:07:18,959 --> 00:07:24,182
I'm gonna go abduct a server engineer and just pull him in here and put the headphones on and press that.

113
00:07:24,222 --> 00:07:26,783
Yeah, Ryan, you're on stream, answer this really good question.

114
00:07:27,143 --> 00:07:35,227
Um, yeah, I mean, it was, um, it's super challenging in so much that there are just a lot of systems all talking together all at once.

115
00:07:36,694 --> 00:07:53,127
In terms of building and scaling, I mean, we had, not in a bragging way, but we had a lot of players show up in the first, I mean, since launch, really, but in the first, like, week, two weeks, we had a ton of players show up and really stress how we built and architected everything.

116
00:07:54,509 --> 00:08:03,456
But we had a lot of partners show up to help us figure out how we scale the game from, you know, where it was a couple months ago to the reality of, you know, millions of players today.

117
00:08:05,466 --> 00:08:11,068
And, you know, a lot of these problems, you, we did a lot of, uh, like bot testing and swarm testing to like,

118
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:15,090
oh, what happens when a million people hit the matchmaking API all at once?

119
00:08:15,871 --> 00:08:19,332
Um, but in reality, like that can only get you so far.

120
00:08:19,392 --> 00:08:24,354
It's not until you have real players doing real behavior against your game on live that you get

121
00:08:24,414 --> 00:08:27,736
like a true sense of how the platform holds up.

122
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:33,758
And a lot of these times, it's not like a problem that you'll see immediately.

123
00:08:34,253 --> 00:08:38,756
Like sometimes services don't fall over gracefully like instantly and you're like,

124
00:08:38,816 --> 00:08:40,037
oh, that's a problem. Let's fix it.

125
00:08:40,057 --> 00:08:43,239
It sometimes takes days and weeks for things to kind of unravel.

126
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:48,223
And it was just, you know, like we had a war room situated in the office here.

127
00:08:48,563 --> 00:08:51,865
And you can imagine like the command center from 24.

128
00:08:52,566 --> 00:08:55,808
We had a lot of monitors with like up to the second game health.

129
00:08:56,669 --> 00:09:00,071
So as soon as we saw like the slightest indication that something was degrading,

130
00:09:00,291 --> 00:09:00,512
you know.

131
00:09:01,437 --> 00:09:04,778
A swarm of engineers would hop on it and fix it as quickly as possible.

132
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:09,661
And just for the cross-play components alone, right,

133
00:09:09,801 --> 00:09:13,022
it's insanely complicated when you think about

134
00:09:13,082 --> 00:09:15,623
just something as simple as, like, oh, a friends list.

135
00:09:15,744 --> 00:09:17,664
Yeah, you got your list and you add your friends.

136
00:09:18,085 --> 00:09:20,646
It's like, well, what about how, you know,

137
00:09:21,046 --> 00:09:22,547
the PlayStation friends list works?

138
00:09:22,627 --> 00:09:24,228
How does that integrate with your friends list?

139
00:09:24,328 --> 00:09:26,669
What about, you know, all of these different platforms

140
00:09:26,729 --> 00:09:28,670
handle all that stuff in different ways?

141
00:09:29,093 --> 00:09:34,835
They all have very strict guidelines that they want us to follow to ensure quality for their platforms,

142
00:09:35,155 --> 00:09:39,136
but they conflict sometimes, and they are different from the way something might be architected.

143
00:09:39,236 --> 00:09:47,679
So, a lot of people had to spend a lot of time and, like, super smart people, like, tackling a really big problem.

144
00:09:47,699 --> 00:09:51,440
It's just, like, you know, super gratifying to see all of those pieces come together,

145
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:58,162
but it even gets, like, reflected in, like, the UIs need to be able to accommodate, like, different presents.

146
00:09:58,751 --> 00:10:04,554
of like on like different platforms and like well you can't show this icon in this case because that's

147
00:10:04,714 --> 00:10:10,458
against this compliance thing but you can show this icon so we need a proxy icon for and like it goes

148
00:10:10,598 --> 00:10:17,361
like the the specific like details there of following all of those rules and making it work

149
00:10:17,421 --> 00:10:23,285
and being a good player experience it's just like it is not to be underestimated like the the effort

150
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,447
that goes into making cross play work at all and there

151
00:10:27,314 --> 00:10:33,939
absolute heroes on the team that managed to pull that stuff together. And I'm continually in awe of

152
00:10:34,719 --> 00:10:39,582
all of those boxes they needed to check. Yeah, totally. I mean, it seems like a complicated

153
00:10:39,642 --> 00:10:43,045
and fascinating topic. Enough that we could spend the whole hour talking about it. I promise we

154
00:10:43,085 --> 00:10:47,808
won't. But as long as we're talking about sort of how you guys got ready for launch and how you

155
00:10:47,848 --> 00:10:48,428
tested everything.

156
00:10:48,727 --> 00:10:51,509
This feeds really well into a question here from FantasyMeister.

157
00:10:51,569 --> 00:10:54,973
They seem to think that you had a pretty smooth launch compared to much bigger publishers,

158
00:10:54,993 --> 00:10:58,336
and they want to know, how'd you pull it off, especially considering the fact that it's crossplay?

159
00:11:00,778 --> 00:11:05,623
That is super flattering, because at times it felt pretty hectic around these parts, but...

160
00:11:07,825 --> 00:11:09,366
I mean, it was a lot of planning, honestly.

161
00:11:09,406 --> 00:11:13,770
Like, we quite literally have a scrum team here at the studio called Ready for Scale.

162
00:11:14,331 --> 00:11:20,056
and it was, I mean that was their mandate was to make sure that our launch went off as smooth as possible.

163
00:11:20,916 --> 00:11:25,980
That's not to say we didn't have the occasional bug show up or the occasional outage that we had to jump on, but

164
00:11:27,802 --> 00:11:33,146
that team spent, I mean Hunter correct me if I'm wrong, but like the better part is six months preparing for this moment.

165
00:11:33,846 --> 00:11:40,111
And we had separate teams put together for cross play specifically, separate teams together for console specifically.

166
00:11:41,754 --> 00:11:43,835
I mean, it's been a work in progress since...

167
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:48,838
Gosh, like, I mean, right around this time last year, we...

168
00:11:48,858 --> 00:11:53,020
You know, as soon as we got the PC open beta out and into the players' hands,

169
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,721
we took up the torch on console.

170
00:11:54,821 --> 00:11:58,103
So, careful planning, collaboration...

171
00:11:58,123 --> 00:12:00,144
It's kind of cliche to say it, but...

172
00:12:01,604 --> 00:12:05,687
We... I mean, we spent a lot of time just preparing for the launch itself.

173
00:12:06,707 --> 00:12:07,427
Yeah, and like...

174
00:12:08,942 --> 00:12:17,309
One of the, like philosophically, like you need to, and I've heard some of my co-workers espouse

175
00:12:17,349 --> 00:12:25,115
this value, is like you don't try to plan, do all of your planning such that like nothing goes wrong.

176
00:12:25,656 --> 00:12:30,600
Because things will go wrong, you put so much more of your focus in how are we going to react

177
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:36,024
when things do go wrong, because it absolutely happens. And so like if a pod falls over and a

178
00:12:36,064 --> 00:12:37,766
bunch of people get booted out to...

179
00:12:38,637 --> 00:12:42,500
The main menu, like how can we handle that elegantly, how can we be ready, how can we

180
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:47,223
see that when that's happening and spool up another pod to replace it.

181
00:12:47,623 --> 00:12:55,428
It's really a philosophical, I think, value set that those guys sort of, and ladies, rally

182
00:12:55,508 --> 00:13:00,130
behind as a way to approach the problem.

183
00:13:00,271 --> 00:13:01,211
Because you just can't.

184
00:13:02,420 --> 00:13:06,323
You can't get everything right, you can't predict all of the things that are going to happen, it's impossible.

185
00:13:06,784 --> 00:13:07,044
Nice.

186
00:13:07,824 --> 00:13:11,488
Yeah, I wonder if, um, we should dig into the design a bit, because this game is, uh,

187
00:13:11,708 --> 00:13:13,549
it's just a fascinating piece to crack apart.

188
00:13:13,569 --> 00:13:16,392
Brian, what do you, uh, what do you, what's your, what's your deal now?

189
00:13:16,412 --> 00:13:17,212
You like two guns?

190
00:13:19,515 --> 00:13:21,718
I've always loved gun slinging.

191
00:13:22,299 --> 00:13:24,462
Two guns on fire, no problem.

192
00:13:24,502 --> 00:13:27,607
Yeah, two guns on fire, what the fuck.

193
00:13:28,308 --> 00:13:32,593
I would categorize this game as having a very nice, efficient loop compared to my old MMO

194
00:13:32,634 --> 00:13:33,835
days which I'll talk about in a bit.

195
00:13:34,856 --> 00:13:39,821
Which is you choose the weapon, you choose a loadout, and then you choose the kind of boss you want to fight.

196
00:13:39,861 --> 00:13:43,904
And then from there the bosses have these nice... like this fight is very...

197
00:13:44,685 --> 00:13:50,710
It's every boss, every monster you go to hunt is very boss fighty in that they have animations you are trying to pin down and positions.

198
00:13:51,411 --> 00:13:55,034
you're trying to memorize both of these. My friends, my anonymous internet friends here,

199
00:13:55,054 --> 00:13:58,176
um, appear to be much more experienced at this than I am.

200
00:13:58,196 --> 00:14:05,601
But even then, just trying to learn and pick up, like, these encounters makes it feel like

201
00:14:05,641 --> 00:14:09,664
something you're playing sort of on your home console as opposed to sort of MMO bosses I'm

202
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:13,246
used to which sort of feel like things that exist on the Internet, if that makes sense.

203
00:14:13,366 --> 00:14:18,530
Like, it feels like a live AI creature that, uh, is co...

204
00:14:19,638 --> 00:14:23,340
It's complicatedly interfacing with everything I'm doing as opposed to something that's just

205
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,821
sort of checking if I hit it or not.

206
00:14:26,703 --> 00:14:28,844
It's hard to sort of pin down that in words, right?

207
00:14:28,864 --> 00:14:33,447
But it feels a little more dynamic and active than a WoW boss battle.

208
00:14:33,628 --> 00:14:35,849
It feels a little bit more like a Dark Souls fight or something.

209
00:14:36,029 --> 00:14:37,170
Let's dig into that for a minute.

210
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:44,075
How did you guys... like this game feels much more focused and dynamic than even a monster

211
00:14:44,115 --> 00:14:47,597
hunter or something like that where you have to chase a monster from zone to zone and wound

212
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:48,198
them and weaken them?

213
00:14:49,190 --> 00:14:53,333
Can you talk a bit about where that comes from and the thinking behind that idea?

214
00:14:55,816 --> 00:15:01,761
The encounters are, I think you hit the nail on the head where it's like Monster Hunter

215
00:15:01,801 --> 00:15:07,846
and Dark Souls style action combat where you're worrying about where's the creature going

216
00:15:07,866 --> 00:15:12,831
to be, how do I roll, how do I get my iframes up so that I don't get hit by that attack

217
00:15:12,871 --> 00:15:15,653
and I can continue to DPS the guy down.

218
00:15:16,841 --> 00:15:22,586
At the same time, we really like, on some of our more complex encounters, to integrate things like

219
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:29,091
raid mechanics, where you will have to avoid particular zones, or you'll have to grab this buff,

220
00:15:29,151 --> 00:15:33,715
and this buff is really useful to be able to deal more damage in this time. Who's going to get the

221
00:15:33,735 --> 00:15:42,561
buff? And we're working on actually some new modes now that'll increase the number of unique

222
00:15:42,622 --> 00:15:44,183
modifiers and behaviors that are on.

223
00:15:44,724 --> 00:15:47,365
encounters to be able to mix them up and have them be different.

224
00:15:48,946 --> 00:15:55,291
That Ember main encounter that you just had is a very learnable, masterable event,

225
00:15:56,031 --> 00:16:01,014
and we want that. We want you to be able to come back to it later and see you got the C rank,

226
00:16:01,035 --> 00:16:06,178
or you got the B rank, or now you got the S plus rank because you take no damage and your DPS up

227
00:16:06,198 --> 00:16:12,042
time is really good because you know where the boss is going to be. But we want to continue to

228
00:16:12,102 --> 00:16:14,263
challenge people. So it's like, how can we develop?

229
00:16:14,934 --> 00:16:19,978
you know, behaviors and content that we can layer on top of these so that we can remix

230
00:16:20,038 --> 00:16:21,540
those fights in interesting ways.

231
00:16:22,140 --> 00:16:22,380
Huh.

232
00:16:22,941 --> 00:16:23,641
That's so interesting.

233
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:29,106
I um, can you talk a bit about sort of the design philosophy that goes into creating

234
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,727
a boss like this or an encounter like this?

235
00:16:30,787 --> 00:16:36,151
I mean, it seems to be significantly more intense than your average, like even single

236
00:16:36,171 --> 00:16:39,434
player boss fight with different levels and different approaches and you always have a

237
00:16:39,474 --> 00:16:41,816
different set of players in the mix.

238
00:16:42,597 --> 00:16:44,638
So like, tell me just as a, as a, like a

239
00:16:45,059 --> 00:16:48,801
Ballpark, how long does the team spend designing and tuning a specific encounter?

240
00:16:49,581 --> 00:16:59,926
I would say that a specific behemoth will take somewhere between three to five months.

241
00:17:00,427 --> 00:17:02,568
Somewhere in that zone.

242
00:17:03,568 --> 00:17:06,430
And that's going along a long sort of...

243
00:17:06,450 --> 00:17:11,152
I don't want to call it an assembly line because that's relatively diminishing.

244
00:17:13,489 --> 00:17:15,591
It has a lot of different stages of development, right?

245
00:17:15,631 --> 00:17:18,433
It'll start off and it'll be something, you know,

246
00:17:19,193 --> 00:17:20,915
what feel do we want to evoke?

247
00:17:20,975 --> 00:17:22,756
You know, what are the, you know,

248
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,457
what's the tone of this encounter?

249
00:17:24,517 --> 00:17:27,159
Is it a majestic beast or is it stalking you?

250
00:17:27,279 --> 00:17:28,600
Or like, what kinds of,

251
00:17:28,780 --> 00:17:30,722
what kind of vibes do we want to give the players?

252
00:17:31,302 --> 00:17:35,606
And then it goes into, okay, well, what moves, you know,

253
00:17:35,846 --> 00:17:39,969
will sort of reflect that tone that we're trying to hit?

254
00:17:40,736 --> 00:17:44,777
Okay, he's very stompy, so we want to figure out some AoE moves, etc.

255
00:17:44,937 --> 00:17:47,438
And we develop that toolkit.

256
00:17:47,458 --> 00:17:50,539
And there are some things that are true across all of our Behemoths,

257
00:17:50,859 --> 00:17:54,320
where we're like, okay, well, what happens when he enters his rage state?

258
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:58,681
And then we can decide some interesting new mechanics that get layered on when

259
00:17:59,061 --> 00:18:01,622
they enter the rage state, when they hit particular damage,

260
00:18:01,882 --> 00:18:05,623
taking thresholds, and they really want to fight back against the Slayer.

261
00:18:06,852 --> 00:18:10,893
Okay, this scary move sort of gets added into their toolkit at this point.

262
00:18:10,953 --> 00:18:12,574
So it will mix up the encounter.

263
00:18:12,594 --> 00:18:16,616
And then they enter their Aether state because they're a Blaze behemoth.

264
00:18:16,676 --> 00:18:21,418
And he'll start shooting a bunch of Blaze attacks at you.

265
00:18:21,538 --> 00:18:27,120
And we go through that process of identifying all of the different moves

266
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,581
that will make up that tone.

267
00:18:28,801 --> 00:18:33,643
And then obviously it's up to a pretty big team of modelers and animators

268
00:18:33,743 --> 00:18:34,763
and effects artists.

269
00:18:35,745 --> 00:18:41,147
tech artists to make that come to life, with the designer trying to tweak and tune the

270
00:18:41,207 --> 00:18:43,807
behavior all the way to the end.

271
00:18:44,348 --> 00:18:49,609
Yeah, what do you think makes a good encounter?

272
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:52,430
What is your ideal challenge for the player?

273
00:18:52,450 --> 00:18:54,170
What are you trying to create with each one of these beasts?

274
00:18:54,950 --> 00:18:57,071
I think it sort of changes on where...

275
00:18:58,353 --> 00:19:04,215
We think a lot about the funnel of a new player, obviously, you know, into your game and the

276
00:19:04,255 --> 00:19:09,076
journey that they're going to go on. And so what's appropriate for somebody early, you know, it's

277
00:19:09,096 --> 00:19:14,998
going to be like, okay, we need to teach you how to interrupt a behemoth. So we have that fire dog

278
00:19:15,118 --> 00:19:20,359
that we just saw has this very interruptible moment where it'll charge at you and certain

279
00:19:20,399 --> 00:19:24,300
attacks make it get staggered and fall to the ground and you get a big DPS window.

280
00:19:24,827 --> 00:19:28,310
So that encounter is all about that mechanic.

281
00:19:28,790 --> 00:19:30,932
But then there are late game encounters where it's like,

282
00:19:31,552 --> 00:19:34,174
OK, this bug is really hard to hit

283
00:19:34,274 --> 00:19:36,656
and shoots a million lasers at you.

284
00:19:37,216 --> 00:19:39,458
And it's like, OK, the key here is

285
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:41,619
that we want it to feel more like a bullet hell game

286
00:19:41,659 --> 00:19:43,941
or something like that, where you're doing a lot of dodging.

287
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:45,902
And there are beams and there are projectiles

288
00:19:45,962 --> 00:19:49,305
and there's more beams, but they do this behavior instead.

289
00:19:49,385 --> 00:19:51,746
And so that's all about dodging and learning

290
00:19:52,007 --> 00:19:52,127
these.

291
00:19:54,849 --> 00:19:58,130
these particular behaviors and patterns.

292
00:19:58,310 --> 00:20:01,551
And so all the encounters are sort of trying to do something different.

293
00:20:01,691 --> 00:20:06,133
But I would say that, you know, if we can hit on like raid mechanics

294
00:20:06,673 --> 00:20:11,914
and on great action combat with like dodging and strafing,

295
00:20:12,895 --> 00:20:17,196
then we're hitting a sweet spot that I think makes Dauntless sort of sort of special.

296
00:20:17,856 --> 00:20:20,397
Yeah. Yeah. And I got to say, like we were mentioning earlier, this game feels.

297
00:20:21,550 --> 00:20:24,871
It feels quick. It feels responsive, dynamic.

298
00:20:26,232 --> 00:20:31,214
It feels very different from a lot of sort of multiplayer boss games that I've played in the past.

299
00:20:31,234 --> 00:20:36,556
So I'm curious, why do you think that is? Is it just the progress in broadband and internet?

300
00:20:36,576 --> 00:20:40,238
Or is there something specific you guys did, or a number of specific choices you made,

301
00:20:40,558 --> 00:20:43,179
to make this game feel and be so responsive?

302
00:20:47,661 --> 00:20:48,602
I think it's the pressure.

303
00:20:49,062 --> 00:20:49,562
Yeah.

304
00:20:49,582 --> 00:20:50,643
Go ahead, Nick.

305
00:20:51,491 --> 00:20:52,772
Jump in on a couple thoughts.

306
00:20:52,792 --> 00:20:57,534
I mean, I think a lot of it has been just kind of our focus on

307
00:20:57,554 --> 00:20:59,995
the type of gameplay experience we wanted to create.

308
00:21:01,336 --> 00:21:05,018
Like, we're big fans of high fidelity, like pixel perfect

309
00:21:05,178 --> 00:21:06,979
dodging, pixel perfect attacks.

310
00:21:08,079 --> 00:21:10,880
When you, like, you just saw, like, we just did, like, a

311
00:21:10,940 --> 00:21:13,882
perfect dodge roll through that Nashor attack, like, feels super

312
00:21:13,942 --> 00:21:16,643
good when you master that skill.

313
00:21:17,804 --> 00:21:20,425
But to support that, obviously, we have to, you know, to your

314
00:21:20,465 --> 00:21:20,885
point, like...

315
00:21:21,650 --> 00:21:25,072
structure the game in a way that supports that kind of play style.

316
00:21:25,333 --> 00:21:29,216
And yeah, I mean, just kind of from day one, we didn't want to have like the tank and spank,

317
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:31,217
quotey finger, I'm going to stop doing quotey fingers.

318
00:21:32,018 --> 00:21:35,621
We're going to, we didn't want to do the tank and spank style thing where it's just like,

319
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:39,104
you know, a number calculator flying up while you're hitting this raid boss,

320
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,845
waiting for the next phase to go off.

321
00:21:41,646 --> 00:21:44,828
We wanted to capture that like really good feeling of, you know, like Bloodborne,

322
00:21:44,868 --> 00:21:50,593
Dark Souls, Dragon's Dogma, where like dodges feel good, blocking feels good.

323
00:21:51,246 --> 00:21:53,747
And you're rewarded for that execution and that mastery.

324
00:21:54,107 --> 00:21:56,008
And a lot of those games are single player, right?

325
00:21:56,068 --> 00:22:01,831
And so it's simply like bringing that kind of gameplay into a multiplayer space

326
00:22:01,911 --> 00:22:04,072
that I think makes it a little bit different.

327
00:22:05,692 --> 00:22:10,314
A lot of those multiplayer games that have encounters like this might be a shooter, right?

328
00:22:10,855 --> 00:22:12,996
But aren't necessarily that style of action game.

329
00:22:13,576 --> 00:22:13,776
Nice.

330
00:22:14,638 --> 00:22:18,180
There's a fantastic question here in chat, let me grab it.

331
00:22:18,220 --> 00:22:20,262
Chucky wants to know what are the challenges it comes,

332
00:22:20,602 --> 00:22:24,805
or what are the challenges you faced when it came to keeping frame rate decent on consoles?

333
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:30,909
I am not the right person to ask about that one, but there are a lot of,

334
00:22:32,490 --> 00:22:36,452
there's certainly a lot of performance optimizations that had to be done by,

335
00:22:36,792 --> 00:22:43,937
you know, technical artist types that understand how to speak to that, you know, more eloquently.

336
00:22:45,283 --> 00:22:52,548
But the optimization process is not something that you typically front load in a game, right?

337
00:22:53,148 --> 00:22:58,511
That might be an interesting philosophy to adjustment to think about, but usually you're like,

338
00:22:58,551 --> 00:23:07,796
let's get it playable, it doesn't matter, hide the polygon, your polygon count sins will not be seen by the player.

339
00:23:08,448 --> 00:23:11,930
You can hide geometry in places, it's fine, we'll fix that later.

340
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:16,072
And then you do get to that point where it's like, okay, we have to do a lot of cleanup of a lot of

341
00:23:16,432 --> 00:23:21,235
of a lot of things that we did to get the game playable quickly to nail the gameplay.

342
00:23:21,675 --> 00:23:28,038
And we all as like developers, right, have really beefy machines that our companies provide to us.

343
00:23:28,779 --> 00:23:33,141
And it's really easy in the demo process to just like not think about that because you

344
00:23:33,181 --> 00:23:34,402
don't experience it. And then

345
00:23:35,070 --> 00:23:39,493
Some time over the course of the project, someone's like, we've got the min spec box,

346
00:23:39,773 --> 00:23:42,995
right? And that gets marched into the office and plugged in and everyone's like,

347
00:23:43,736 --> 00:23:50,781
oh, okay, let's try to figure out what do we need to do now? Now that we know what we want our game

348
00:23:50,821 --> 00:23:56,485
to look like, what we want our game to play like, how are we going to make it fit? And so that's

349
00:23:56,545 --> 00:24:01,808
just the process of cleaning up a bunch of stuff and it's also sometimes changing.

350
00:24:02,425 --> 00:24:04,887
We're going to be doing a lot of mechanics to accommodate.

351
00:24:05,427 --> 00:24:11,271
We're in a place like right now where you potentially need to

352
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,694
tune down some kind of mechanic that is emitting a lot of

353
00:24:15,754 --> 00:24:16,174
particles.

354
00:24:16,234 --> 00:24:18,115
And we're really happy with the way this looks right now.

355
00:24:18,155 --> 00:24:20,096
We don't really have the time to refactor it.

356
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:23,959
So, okay, let's just tune down the number of volcanoes that

357
00:24:23,999 --> 00:24:25,460
Helion can spawn at once.

358
00:24:25,680 --> 00:24:27,381
And that will mitigate the problem.

359
00:24:27,441 --> 00:24:28,441
That fight is very hard.

360
00:24:28,662 --> 00:24:29,942
That fight is also hard.

361
00:24:31,085 --> 00:24:37,707
And so it's sort of a give and take with a bunch of different disciplines to hit that stuff.

362
00:24:40,508 --> 00:24:49,089
It's a continuing, ongoing effort. We are not easing up. We still are doing work on performance

363
00:24:49,169 --> 00:24:53,530
and I imagine we'll continue to for a while. Yeah, and to kind of build on that just a little

364
00:24:53,571 --> 00:24:55,291
bit, you know, Hunter touched on it.

365
00:24:55,973 --> 00:25:00,774
A lot of the machines that we use here at the office are really beefy and run the game

366
00:25:00,814 --> 00:25:01,334
really well.

367
00:25:02,115 --> 00:25:06,376
So it's kind of easy to lose sight that a lot of folks, I mean I think one of the most

368
00:25:06,436 --> 00:25:09,957
predominant GPUs that runs Dauntless on PC is Intel Integrated.

369
00:25:11,257 --> 00:25:17,539
Which a lot of the work that we did for console has helped us actually drive down and optimize

370
00:25:17,579 --> 00:25:18,960
our min spec on PC.

371
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:24,841
So we get a lot of win-wins there and even as it relates to...

372
00:25:25,970 --> 00:25:30,852
The Nintendo Switch version, which we're working on right now, we debuted it a couple weeks ago at E3.

373
00:25:30,932 --> 00:25:36,255
We had to do further optimizations to get it running smoothly on the Switch,

374
00:25:36,435 --> 00:25:41,598
but we were able to take those learnings and pipe them back to the console version and to the PC version.

375
00:25:41,658 --> 00:25:47,541
So, anytime we kind of get a win on any platform as to how to optimize something like VFX or particles,

376
00:25:48,642 --> 00:25:51,083
we're able to kind of share that across all the platforms.

377
00:25:51,103 --> 00:25:54,625
Because, you know, to your point earlier, it's cross-play, it's all one build.

378
00:25:55,815 --> 00:26:00,219
So what we do on one platform has to roll out and apply to the others as well.

379
00:26:00,899 --> 00:26:05,584
Yeah, it feels like a lot of devs who want to get their games on Switch are already on it,

380
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:09,347
or are well on the way. But I'm curious, for those who haven't, based on your current work,

381
00:26:09,407 --> 00:26:14,131
is there any advice you'd give to other developers who are working on Switch games? Are there

382
00:26:14,411 --> 00:26:16,754
original games or ports about what you've learned about how to build

383
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:18,655
and adapt your game for that platform?

384
00:26:19,890 --> 00:26:27,216
We're still pretty early on, like we've been dedicated to developing on Switch for maybe a couple of months now, if that.

385
00:26:28,377 --> 00:26:34,242
So I will caution that anything that I say should not be best practice because we haven't quite executed yet.

386
00:26:34,342 --> 00:26:40,928
But we chose to partner with Iron Galaxy to help us co-dev the Switch version.

387
00:26:41,929 --> 00:26:46,693
They've done a phenomenal job with other games like Skyrim, Diablo...

388
00:26:47,729 --> 00:26:51,812
um bringing it to the switch and they have a lot of expertise into the you know not only like

389
00:26:52,732 --> 00:26:59,957
the console and the hardware but also the form factor um and um we wanted to effectively tap

390
00:26:59,997 --> 00:27:06,120
into that expertise and help us deliver something unique and memorable um on the switch as well

391
00:27:06,140 --> 00:27:08,922
i feel like one of the reasons this the switch is um

392
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:24,312
Not to overly philosophize, but one of the reasons the Switch is so successful is that it has a form factor that totally befits hardcore games.

393
00:27:24,712 --> 00:27:35,923
I remember, I've developed games for the Wii back in the day, and that is a very unique platform that lets you do a lot of interesting things.

394
00:27:36,347 --> 00:27:39,728
but it also does not let you take thing here and put it on there, right?

395
00:27:39,748 --> 00:27:42,548
Because it's like, well, how does that work with the motion, the sensor bar?

396
00:27:42,929 --> 00:27:45,369
Right. And that like, you just simply can't do things like that.

397
00:27:45,709 --> 00:27:46,670
But for the switch, right.

398
00:27:46,710 --> 00:27:48,330
It's like it's got the sticks.

399
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,931
It's got the buttons in the same layout.

400
00:27:49,991 --> 00:27:52,031
It's actually like relatively.

401
00:27:54,552 --> 00:27:57,813
It's not as big of a departure as it would have been historically to think

402
00:27:57,873 --> 00:28:01,274
about the like the Nintendo platform as really fundamentally different than

403
00:28:01,654 --> 00:28:02,815
the PlayStation or the Xbox.

404
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:08,465
Yeah, totally. Um, Brian, you are killing it on stream right now. Is that a glaive you're using?

405
00:28:08,485 --> 00:28:12,649
Uh, it's a spear. I call it the warpike. Sorry, dealing with some controller

406
00:28:12,669 --> 00:28:17,292
mobile controller challenges. So I'm going to create directions. This is not the game's problem.

407
00:28:17,312 --> 00:28:24,118
Trust me. All right, well, let's you focused on that. Um, yeah. So let's talk about the, uh,

408
00:28:24,258 --> 00:28:27,360
the design. I'm curious to know, you know, one of the things that caught my eye about this game

409
00:28:27,380 --> 00:28:28,421
when it launches is free to play.

410
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:32,987
For me, it's very much like Monster Hunter, which I loved with a deep passion for about

411
00:28:33,267 --> 00:28:34,428
20 hours and then I was done.

412
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:40,414
But another thing about it was that it seemed like in a lot of the marketing materials there

413
00:28:40,434 --> 00:28:45,399
was a lot of hype around a smooth progression curve with a lot of really challenging stuff

414
00:28:45,419 --> 00:28:46,801
near the end for high level players.

415
00:28:48,723 --> 00:28:49,904
It was pitched as a game that has...

416
00:28:50,663 --> 00:28:55,044
You know, multiple layers and depths of content for players, depending on how much, how far

417
00:28:55,064 --> 00:28:55,584
they want to go.

418
00:28:56,524 --> 00:28:58,264
Now that you're like, you know, about a munch...

419
00:28:58,764 --> 00:28:59,004
Wow.

420
00:28:59,244 --> 00:29:00,545
About a month out from launch.

421
00:29:01,605 --> 00:29:02,805
He's thinking about lunch over there.

422
00:29:03,385 --> 00:29:04,545
I'm getting real hungry over here.

423
00:29:04,585 --> 00:29:09,946
But now that you're about a month out from launch, I'm curious to know, how is your progression

424
00:29:10,006 --> 00:29:13,647
plan and your, how has the game stood up to the players basically?

425
00:29:13,687 --> 00:29:17,288
Like how quickly are they getting through the content based on your expectations and

426
00:29:17,328 --> 00:29:18,908
how has that informed the way you design the game?

427
00:29:19,827 --> 00:29:29,655
That's a great question. I think generally, so we've been testing progression for a while,

428
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:38,562
and we had a very big progression revamp to the game right before launch. So we were able to

429
00:29:39,062 --> 00:29:44,787
analyze a lot of the player behavior ahead, and so this is our, you know,

430
00:29:45,312 --> 00:29:48,134
most finely tuned iteration of the progression of Dauntless,

431
00:29:48,194 --> 00:29:50,556
and it will continue to evolve and change.

432
00:29:50,736 --> 00:29:55,800
But we had a lot of data to look at and a lot of player

433
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:58,722
sentiment to analyze to be able to get to where we are right

434
00:29:58,762 --> 00:30:02,505
now, which has been a lot closer than we have been historically,

435
00:30:02,545 --> 00:30:07,849
which is one of the advantages, obviously, of having a beta

436
00:30:07,909 --> 00:30:10,771
environment, a closed alpha environment,

437
00:30:10,791 --> 00:30:13,313
to just be able to accumulate that learning over time.

438
00:30:13,413 --> 00:30:13,573
But.

439
00:30:14,030 --> 00:30:19,333
But yeah, the ramp for a new player is a really tricky thing

440
00:30:19,533 --> 00:30:24,096
for a game that is intending to be extremely skill-based.

441
00:30:25,337 --> 00:30:29,399
Like, you don't want to challenge the player too quickly.

442
00:30:29,419 --> 00:30:35,123
You also don't want to make the player feel like there's nothing

443
00:30:35,183 --> 00:30:38,525
for them to sink their teeth into at the same time.

444
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:43,568
Like, if you imagine somebody who comes across...

445
00:30:44,604 --> 00:30:48,324
Dauntless on a stream somewhere, and it's like,

446
00:30:48,404 --> 00:30:50,205
oh, that game looks interesting. I'll give it a try.

447
00:30:50,245 --> 00:30:51,985
I've never played games of that genre.

448
00:30:52,305 --> 00:30:54,906
Put them into the same progression as,

449
00:30:54,926 --> 00:30:59,487
I am the king of Dark Souls,

450
00:30:59,567 --> 00:31:03,628
and I am a master of i-framing stuff.

451
00:31:04,228 --> 00:31:04,968
Yes, you rang?

452
00:31:05,869 --> 00:31:07,029
There he is. It's Nick.

453
00:31:07,949 --> 00:31:09,810
Put those players through the same progression.

454
00:31:09,870 --> 00:31:11,370
That's a really tricky thing, because

455
00:31:13,819 --> 00:31:15,560
The iframe king is going to be like,

456
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,281
ah, it's a game for babies.

457
00:31:17,822 --> 00:31:18,883
The other person is going to be like,

458
00:31:19,083 --> 00:31:23,105
this is legitimately a new thing that I'm trying to wrap my head around as a gamer, period.

459
00:31:23,726 --> 00:31:27,829
And so the goal with a lot of our progression rework

460
00:31:28,009 --> 00:31:31,351
was to let players pace themselves through the game

461
00:31:31,371 --> 00:31:33,653
a little bit more at their own speed.

462
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:38,096
So you can blitz through the progression pretty quickly.

463
00:31:38,937 --> 00:31:39,757
You can also...

464
00:31:40,217 --> 00:31:46,461
find a lot of side quests to do and get your feet and not necessarily push yourself to that next behemoth if you don't feel ready for it.

465
00:31:47,222 --> 00:31:52,386
A lot of what we have to do also is think about matchmaking queue health, right?

466
00:31:52,466 --> 00:31:55,969
And so there are a lot of different monsters to fight in the game.

467
00:31:56,429 --> 00:32:02,493
And if you make people, you know, skill out of these too quickly,

468
00:32:02,814 --> 00:32:06,396
then they sit here and like, we want you to be able to find a party really quickly.

469
00:32:06,476 --> 00:32:09,138
So how do we incentivize people to keep doing this fight?

470
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:12,936
But then it's boring for those people, so how do you incentivize them more?

471
00:32:13,217 --> 00:32:18,320
And so there's a lot of different variables to take into account.

472
00:32:18,380 --> 00:32:21,363
And at the end of the day, you're usually sacrificing one or the other.

473
00:32:22,163 --> 00:32:26,186
There's nothing that's perfectly going to hit all of them, but letting the player drive their

474
00:32:26,726 --> 00:32:33,571
progression with more agency themselves is much better than a really prescriptive

475
00:32:34,328 --> 00:32:41,111
campaign type encounter, which is what we migrated away from in our previous iteration.

476
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:45,953
Yeah, it makes a lot of sense. It sounds like, if I understand you right, there's a core progression

477
00:32:45,993 --> 00:32:50,055
that has a lot to do with skill and that kind of thing. And then there's lots of side stuff to do

478
00:32:50,075 --> 00:32:55,037
for people who want to break from that, or time to practice things, or just to not be under that

479
00:32:55,077 --> 00:32:59,959
kind of pressure. Yeah, I mean, you can live in that ecosystem for a while without moving forward,

480
00:33:00,019 --> 00:33:02,980
and it's okay, and it's still fun, and there are still objectives for you.

481
00:33:03,413 --> 00:33:08,135
Yeah, tell me, as soon as you launched, have any players sort of capped out? Have they gotten to

482
00:33:08,155 --> 00:33:14,298
what you consider end game content yet? It's tricky. I would need to look, because we did

483
00:33:14,338 --> 00:33:21,940
not do a complete progression wipe at launch to take all of our legacy players and delete all

484
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:27,462
their progress. So those people, we added a bunch of new systems, like the mastery system, for

485
00:33:27,523 --> 00:33:29,843
example, is one of the longest tail.

486
00:33:30,475 --> 00:33:48,809
things to do in our game, which is essentially like, have you crafted every weapon? Have you crafted every armor set? Have you interrupted this behemoth a thousand times? Have you like, it's like a achievement system and also like core, like player level tracker, like rolled into one.

487
00:33:48,929 --> 00:33:55,675
And so there are people that have maxed out that system and have played, you know, an ungodly number of hours since launch.

488
00:33:56,651 --> 00:34:00,774
and why we're continually on the grind to keep adding new systems and new content,

489
00:34:00,814 --> 00:34:04,096
new behemoths, new weapons to the game, and we'll continue to do so.

490
00:34:06,358 --> 00:34:06,959
Absolutely.

491
00:34:06,979 --> 00:34:14,464
But there are probably still some things that no player has managed to check off every single box.

492
00:34:15,185 --> 00:34:18,688
I have yet to see a naked no-hit run of Rescuri yet,

493
00:34:18,868 --> 00:34:20,109
so there's still that somewhere.

494
00:34:21,430 --> 00:34:23,291
But to kind of build on that a little bit,

495
00:34:25,454 --> 00:34:31,355
In addition to what I would call the core experience to Dauntless, which is fight these

496
00:34:31,395 --> 00:34:35,756
behemoths, craft these weapons to get better and stronger so that you can fight the next

497
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:40,718
set of behemoths, Hunter and the design team are already hard at work on what is going

498
00:34:40,738 --> 00:34:47,280
to be a new gameplay experience that sits alongside the core, call it story and progression.

499
00:34:48,159 --> 00:34:50,241
We're going to be launching it in mid-July.

500
00:34:50,261 --> 00:34:55,225
It comes complete with its own season and heralding all this new content and stuff.

501
00:34:55,325 --> 00:35:00,250
But, effectively, it's going to be what is this Trials mode.

502
00:35:00,330 --> 00:35:07,336
And what Hunter mentioned before is looking at ways that we can kind of flip what the player knows about Dauntless on its head.

503
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:13,219
Oh, I know Embermane. He's the fire kitty who charges that I have to interrupt him.

504
00:35:13,299 --> 00:35:14,779
Oh, good thing I'm good at interrupting.

505
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,980
Oh wait, why are there thunder clouds everywhere?

506
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,421
Wait, why are there thunder totems everywhere?

507
00:35:19,461 --> 00:35:21,782
What's going on? This is so much more challenging now.

508
00:35:23,143 --> 00:35:27,824
And the point of that mode is to give players who have maxed out on progression

509
00:35:27,844 --> 00:35:31,966
a weekly reason to come back and a weekly challenge for them to overcome.

510
00:35:31,986 --> 00:35:34,767
Nice. Yeah, do you feel...

511
00:35:36,068 --> 00:35:40,351
pressured at all to keep the game? I mean, clearly you feel there's a demand for content that you

512
00:35:40,391 --> 00:35:44,275
must fill, right? There's a voracious hunger for new systems, new monsters, that kind of thing.

513
00:35:45,596 --> 00:35:54,003
Do you feel, do you, boy, do you feel like you're working more now that it's live than you were

514
00:35:54,063 --> 00:35:59,067
when it wasn't live or less? Does that make sense? Like, is it more work to support a live game than

515
00:35:59,087 --> 00:36:02,509
it is to develop a live game or vice versa? I think there's...

516
00:36:04,369 --> 00:36:07,031
There's definitely more gravity to it, right?

517
00:36:07,131 --> 00:36:13,374
Like, when something happens on live and, you know, there's millions of players playing,

518
00:36:13,875 --> 00:36:18,978
the gravity of that situation is much more pronounced than, say, like, you know, in our

519
00:36:19,298 --> 00:36:23,060
previous pre-launch realm in early access where we had, you know, tens of thousands,

520
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,961
hundreds of thousands at peak sometimes.

521
00:36:27,502 --> 00:36:29,443
I don't know if it definitely...

522
00:36:29,463 --> 00:36:33,045
I wouldn't say it's easier or harder.

523
00:36:33,126 --> 00:36:33,826
It's just different.

524
00:36:34,216 --> 00:36:35,638
If I can use that as a cop-out.

525
00:36:36,639 --> 00:36:36,920
Sure.

526
00:36:38,422 --> 00:36:46,092
I ask because this whole year I've been thinking about that story about Fortnite and how they famously have a very quick update schedule.

527
00:36:46,132 --> 00:36:49,677
And then a story came out a little while ago that was saying that that's due to the fact that they're working...

528
00:36:50,395 --> 00:36:50,995
way too hard.

529
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,918
They're crunching all the time, or at least some people there say they are.

530
00:36:53,978 --> 00:36:58,601
Anyway, specifically just for journalistic dignity, Polygon reported that the QA team

531
00:36:58,661 --> 00:37:02,024
was working at what they classify as a very high level.

532
00:37:03,165 --> 00:37:07,388
And corollary to that, which is I'm sure something you all have watched from afar, is...

533
00:37:08,229 --> 00:37:13,772
Their direct competitor, Apex Legends, has been mocked by certain people, not by me, I love that game,

534
00:37:14,112 --> 00:37:18,034
for not updating as fast, you know, on a weekly basis like Fortnite does. Like Battle Royale,

535
00:37:18,054 --> 00:37:22,677
it seems right now, the people playing in that genre want things as fast as possible. Certainly

536
00:37:22,737 --> 00:37:29,461
I do, you know, I like Apex, I want new content, but do you think, has there been any change

537
00:37:30,101 --> 00:37:34,804
as live game developers, do you think, in how your audience is, how fast they want content, I guess?

538
00:37:36,484 --> 00:37:41,845
Um, I think, and Hunter can elaborate, I got this, so there's two points in there to unpack.

539
00:37:41,885 --> 00:37:47,827
The first one I'll let Hunter elaborate on, which is, um, I think there, there's kind of multiple

540
00:37:47,847 --> 00:37:53,989
ways that we can design content for players. Creating a behemoth creates, you know, a, not a

541
00:37:54,089 --> 00:37:59,311
finite, but let's call it 20 to 30 hours worth of gameplay for a player. You know, you got the lesser

542
00:37:59,331 --> 00:38:04,693
version to beat, the regular version, the dire version, the heroic, the heroic plus version.

543
00:38:05,290 --> 00:38:09,472
You got to craft all the gear out of it because you're a completionist and must have everything.

544
00:38:10,432 --> 00:38:16,114
So that kind of has like a finite experience inside of it but to Hunter's credit and his

545
00:38:16,154 --> 00:38:23,517
team's credit he spent a lot of time thinking about designing kind of like at the system level

546
00:38:24,318 --> 00:38:28,879
so that when we you know do things like add new weapons or add new behemoths okay how are we

547
00:38:28,919 --> 00:38:33,641
thinking about piping our learnings and these designs back into previous experiences.

548
00:38:35,308 --> 00:38:41,630
So that with each new behemoth we create, we use the knowledge and the design there throughout the rest of the game and elsewhere.

549
00:38:41,650 --> 00:39:03,217
I think the second point to make there is, we, you know, it's, the topic of crunch and the topic of work culture in the games industry is always such a tough subject because you hear these horror stories about people working, you know, 80 to 100 hour weeks, never seeing their families, having to, you know, have to go to work, and it's just, it's just a really tough subject.

550
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:08,720
to go to doctors mid crunch and to be totally transparent,

551
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,961
like we pushed really hard leading into launch

552
00:39:11,001 --> 00:39:11,761
for a couple of weeks,

553
00:39:13,022 --> 00:39:15,523
always in a very respectable, sustainable manner.

554
00:39:15,683 --> 00:39:19,845
Like we more than anything at this studio

555
00:39:19,945 --> 00:39:21,986
believe in sustainable game development.

556
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,487
We treat each other like family.

557
00:39:25,007 --> 00:39:26,127
We look out for each other.

558
00:39:26,367 --> 00:39:30,449
If someone's having a day, we get them out of here.

559
00:39:30,489 --> 00:39:32,050
We figure out how we can cover for them.

560
00:39:33,892 --> 00:39:37,394
Because ultimately, like, I mean just personally and candidly speaking,

561
00:39:37,834 --> 00:39:40,896
when Jesse picked up the phone to talk to me about joining the company,

562
00:39:40,956 --> 00:39:42,537
he said, Nick, I want to retire with you.

563
00:39:42,677 --> 00:39:46,560
Like, I want to make games until I retire, and I want you to be a part of it.

564
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,303
And that's like, I mean, the reason why I picked up the phone and talked to Andy

565
00:39:50,343 --> 00:39:53,805
is like, dude, I want to do this with you until we retire.

566
00:39:53,965 --> 00:39:56,927
Like, we want to make games because we love making games,

567
00:39:56,967 --> 00:39:58,948
and I want to do it with you because you're an awesome dude.

568
00:39:59,502 --> 00:40:02,644
and I want to support you and I want to support your journey.

569
00:40:02,664 --> 00:40:03,905
I'm not retiring anytime soon.

570
00:40:04,305 --> 00:40:06,407
No, no, no, no.

571
00:40:07,227 --> 00:40:08,888
That's what does really well.

572
00:40:08,968 --> 00:40:11,330
That mentality and that respect for each other

573
00:40:11,450 --> 00:40:14,652
permeates every person and every team here at the studio.

574
00:40:15,973 --> 00:40:17,234
That's fantastic. I'm glad to hear it.

575
00:40:17,254 --> 00:40:20,616
Tell me, is there anything specifically you like, how do you?

576
00:40:21,422 --> 00:40:27,367
This is something that comes up in other conversations with developers, and it's hard for anyone to talk about because so much of this industry is driven on true passion.

577
00:40:27,727 --> 00:40:30,650
Like, people really want to make games, and they really want to make games that are incredible.

578
00:40:31,230 --> 00:40:32,991
And often they will work very hard on them.

579
00:40:33,412 --> 00:40:37,855
So at the studio, how do you manage that?

580
00:40:38,015 --> 00:40:43,280
When people are working, how do you tell the difference between passionate work and overwork?

581
00:40:43,540 --> 00:40:47,543
And are there any specific systems or processes you have in place to control for that?

582
00:40:49,346 --> 00:40:59,109
Yeah, I mean, it was kind of a, you know, mentorship and managing teams is a very, I'm sure you know, very complicated, nuanced, lots of different opinions on how best to approach it.

583
00:41:00,309 --> 00:41:10,812
And personally speaking, I don't know if there's any one right way to do it, but there's a reason why the studio is 90 people and not 2000 people.

584
00:41:11,012 --> 00:41:14,533
Like, we want to have a one-to-one relationship with each of our peers.

585
00:41:16,173 --> 00:41:18,054
And just personally speaking, like on.

586
00:41:18,635 --> 00:41:23,416
The publishing team, I spend a lot of like most of my time with my people.

587
00:41:24,316 --> 00:41:28,977
Like one on one's personal conversations, mentorship, like, what do you want to do?

588
00:41:29,037 --> 00:41:30,337
What's your passion in life?

589
00:41:30,397 --> 00:41:31,957
How are you feeling about your work?

590
00:41:32,037 --> 00:41:33,117
Am I challenging you?

591
00:41:35,178 --> 00:41:40,099
Like that kind of that kind of relationship and that kind of behavior, again, is like

592
00:41:40,379 --> 00:41:42,359
it permeates every team inside the studio.

593
00:41:42,399 --> 00:41:46,960
And it it starts with the top down, like Jesse, Sean, Robin, the other senior

594
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:47,820
leaders at the company.

595
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:56,287
That's how I'm mentored, and that is how I reflect, that is how I mentor to the publishing team as well.

596
00:41:57,489 --> 00:42:01,453
Yeah, fair enough. I wonder, last question about this and then we'll move on to, I think we want

597
00:42:01,473 --> 00:42:05,979
to talk about some of this incredible art style here, but you know I've seen that there's been a

598
00:42:07,139 --> 00:42:10,401
a high influx of players. I think you guys are at 5 million, 6 million, something like that.

599
00:42:11,062 --> 00:42:14,144
The numbers look pretty good for this game. Has that

600
00:42:14,645 --> 00:42:18,568
changed the pace of your production at all, or do you feel any pressure to ramp up

601
00:42:18,608 --> 00:42:22,030
now that the game is sort of taking off, or is it still business as usual?

602
00:42:22,711 --> 00:42:26,694
A little, like column A, column B. I mean, we

603
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:30,316
crossed 10 million unique players

604
00:42:30,437 --> 00:42:34,139
and you correct me if I'm wrong, I think it was 10 around E3 a couple weeks ago.

605
00:42:34,159 --> 00:42:35,380
Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

606
00:42:36,263 --> 00:42:40,025
Which is a tremendous accomplishment and everyone here is super proud of it.

607
00:42:41,806 --> 00:42:46,148
And it, I don't know if it changed, I don't like using the urgency word,

608
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:49,530
but I don't know if it changed the urgency at which we work.

609
00:42:50,391 --> 00:42:55,514
But it certainly changed how we deployed some of our efforts and our resources.

610
00:42:57,575 --> 00:43:03,238
Like to, like to expand on that a bit, I think it was striking when the iron was hot.

611
00:43:03,618 --> 00:43:03,818
Like we...

612
00:43:04,593 --> 00:43:10,797
We set up this launch, we believed that end of May was going to be perfect for us as a studio and a good time for the industry.

613
00:43:12,338 --> 00:43:15,301
And it turned out that both of those assumptions were accurate.

614
00:43:15,321 --> 00:43:24,247
And we're like, okay, the strategy is sound, it's time to double down now that we've got everyone's attention, everyone's playing the game, the game is holding up, people are having a lot of fun.

615
00:43:24,988 --> 00:43:26,569
We're getting 80s and 85s on our review scores.

616
00:43:28,907 --> 00:43:36,612
We're firing on all cylinders, now is the time to double down on it because we have a captive audience, essentially, to talk about Dauntless.

617
00:43:37,412 --> 00:43:42,316
Right on. There's a question in chat I want to get back to. I haven't let it sit here for a while, but it's good.

618
00:43:42,376 --> 00:43:45,898
Fantasymeister wants to know, how many art styles did you go through before setting on this one?

619
00:43:47,619 --> 00:43:48,760
Oof. If any.

620
00:43:49,020 --> 00:43:49,941
That predates me.

621
00:43:50,421 --> 00:43:55,685
That also predates me as well, and I'm looking over my shoulder. Our art director is not at his desk.

622
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:57,646
Oh man. Well, we'll come back to that.

623
00:43:58,222 --> 00:44:00,464
Yeah, I mean, I can touch on it a little bit.

624
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:04,227
Like, we have an art book, and it's not me shilling the art book,

625
00:44:04,307 --> 00:44:08,831
but it's a great exploration on how we discovered the style of Dauntless.

626
00:44:09,331 --> 00:44:15,716
And what was super important to us early on was having a more stylized appeal to the game

627
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:21,440
rather than, like, something like Final Fantasy that's hyper-realistic, like, photo-realistic visuals.

628
00:44:21,681 --> 00:44:23,822
I love Final Fantasy. This is not a knock on Final Fantasy.

629
00:44:25,098 --> 00:44:31,362
Because being a live game, we knew this game was going to exist for, you know, five, six, seven, ten years, potentially.

630
00:44:32,282 --> 00:44:41,007
And we wanted to create a style that would stand the test of time and not be a reflection of the tools that we had at the time when we created the game, essentially.

631
00:44:42,007 --> 00:44:50,472
Yeah, it seems like it would do you a favor in terms of making the game... giving it more longevity, and giving it more of an iconic look that doesn't necessarily...

632
00:44:51,248 --> 00:44:53,970
Um, sort of fall by the wayside as the years go by.

633
00:44:53,990 --> 00:44:57,973
Uh, I was distracted because Chocky here has a really good question.

634
00:44:58,173 --> 00:44:59,494
Uh, are there any interesting systems?

635
00:44:59,694 --> 00:45:01,235
I'm sorry, I gotta interrupt you.

636
00:45:01,255 --> 00:45:04,338
You've got a goal when you're on fire to put out the fire.

637
00:45:04,498 --> 00:45:08,941
I just, it is, I am having a really hard time listening when you're on fire.

638
00:45:09,001 --> 00:45:12,904
And how, how long has that been going on for, Hunter?

639
00:45:12,924 --> 00:45:14,325
Oh man, it's just.

640
00:45:14,954 --> 00:45:17,215
I just needed to say that, I'm really sorry.

641
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:19,096
Brian, just tuck, tuck, and roll.

642
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:20,237
Just roll, just keep rolling.

643
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:22,378
Yeah, nice.

644
00:45:22,558 --> 00:45:24,279
Let's not pretend this isn't how it actually went,

645
00:45:24,319 --> 00:45:26,600
close to some fire, just standing there.

646
00:45:27,760 --> 00:45:31,202
Yeah, big shoutouts to Brian, it's hard to play a video game and talk on stream at the same time,

647
00:45:31,222 --> 00:45:33,823
especially when you're supporting a team of three other people.

648
00:45:34,964 --> 00:45:36,324
You're killing it.

649
00:45:36,364 --> 00:45:36,645
Literally.

650
00:45:39,565 --> 00:45:44,326
Chucky wants to know, are there any interesting systems or programming languages to power the back end of Dauntless?

651
00:45:44,486 --> 00:45:47,948
Is there anything interesting going on back there? Any funny stories? Any weird things going on?

652
00:45:50,268 --> 00:45:50,648
That is...

653
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:50,728
Oof.

654
00:45:53,009 --> 00:45:55,310
We are now completely outside my realm of knowledge.

655
00:45:55,670 --> 00:45:57,271
Of course.

656
00:45:57,431 --> 00:46:01,232
I know like, two lines of my sequel, Drop Table, that's about it.

657
00:46:02,532 --> 00:46:03,012
More than me.

658
00:46:03,352 --> 00:46:03,573
Yeah.

659
00:46:03,593 --> 00:46:03,853
Great work.

660
00:46:05,786 --> 00:46:12,810
Yeah, there's certainly a lot. I mean, I know we use a lot of Python, a lot of...

661
00:46:12,830 --> 00:46:16,032
Let's see the other one. This is how much I know about it.

662
00:46:16,052 --> 00:46:18,893
Python, C, a lot of Unreal blueprints.

663
00:46:20,414 --> 00:46:26,138
Sure. Yeah, well, we should talk about something that you have a lot of experience with. Let's

664
00:46:26,158 --> 00:46:30,160
talk about getting this game out in front of people and publishing it. I'm so curious to

665
00:46:30,180 --> 00:46:33,001
know, why did you guys choose to work with Epic on this?

666
00:46:34,352 --> 00:46:40,899
Yeah, so we've been using Unreal even, I mean, before we worked here at Phoenix Labs.

667
00:46:42,060 --> 00:46:48,506
But when we decided on using UE4 for Dauntless, I mean, we began like a really good relationship

668
00:46:48,766 --> 00:46:54,052
with everyone at Epic. So we had our, like, we had a pre-existing relationship with them.

669
00:46:54,412 --> 00:46:56,774
And over a year ago, Epic

670
00:46:58,645 --> 00:47:04,786
started sharing confidentially their kind of vision for what the next step for them was as a company.

671
00:47:04,806 --> 00:47:10,327
You know, like they've got Fortnite, they've got this massive, not even game, cultural experience

672
00:47:10,348 --> 00:47:17,609
happening right now. And they wanted to find out what was the next big step for them. So

673
00:47:18,409 --> 00:47:23,791
they talked about things like the store, which they've launched. They've talked about helping

674
00:47:23,991 --> 00:47:27,412
other developers bring their games to market. You know, there's a lot of

675
00:47:27,952 --> 00:47:32,675
a great independent titles on the Epic Games Store alongside the bigger titles like the

676
00:47:32,715 --> 00:47:33,835
Borderlands of the World.

677
00:47:36,196 --> 00:47:41,339
And as we talked with them about the future of Dauntless and how we wanted to bring it

678
00:47:41,379 --> 00:47:47,042
to console, this idea for cross-play started coalescing between our team and their team.

679
00:47:47,842 --> 00:47:55,366
And Tim, Joe, Hector, everyone at Epic was hugely supportive of it and wanted to find

680
00:47:55,406 --> 00:47:56,827
a way to make it work.

681
00:47:58,005 --> 00:48:08,814
essentially use us as the vehicle to get the first game to launch with cross-play,

682
00:48:08,894 --> 00:48:12,958
as opposed to it being an after-the-fact type deal with first party.

683
00:48:13,778 --> 00:48:18,522
And it was, yeah, I mean, it's cliche to say it, but...

684
00:48:19,497 --> 00:48:23,738
Like we resonate with the type of people at Epic, the company that they are.

685
00:48:23,798 --> 00:48:27,579
Like a lot of our philosophies are their philosophies, their approach to game

686
00:48:27,619 --> 00:48:29,039
development, very similar to ours.

687
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:33,600
Um, and our goals were aligned and, um, it just, it made sense.

688
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:34,860
Hmm.

689
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:35,580
That, yeah.

690
00:48:35,720 --> 00:48:42,541
I wonder, was it tricky like to, to go to the two stakeholders before launch?

691
00:48:42,721 --> 00:48:45,442
Did you, did you just go through Epic to, to get all that stuff plugged in?

692
00:48:45,462 --> 00:48:47,242
Or did you have to go to Sony and Microsoft?

693
00:48:47,924 --> 00:48:52,045
and actually talk to them directly about making this a cross-play game at launch.

694
00:48:52,605 --> 00:48:56,246
It was a little bit of both, if I'm being completely transparent.

695
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:02,467
It was new for all parties involved, so we were all kind of figuring out in real time

696
00:49:02,527 --> 00:49:07,948
what was the best path forward. So yeah, we talked to Epic, Epic talked to first party,

697
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:12,949
we talked to first party, all three of us talked together. I mean, at the end of the day,

698
00:49:14,089 --> 00:49:15,810
what was most important to us was

699
00:49:17,271 --> 00:49:22,074
Kind of what we talked about at the beginning of our chat was bringing people together with

700
00:49:22,094 --> 00:49:28,799
Dauntless and it just felt really bad to us to say that but then not to have crossplay.

701
00:49:29,760 --> 00:49:34,123
So I mean it's like literally we're like, man, the game is in open beta on PC.

702
00:49:34,223 --> 00:49:34,684
What's next?

703
00:49:34,764 --> 00:49:35,244
Console.

704
00:49:35,504 --> 00:49:35,824
Okay.

705
00:49:36,465 --> 00:49:37,185
And crossplay.

706
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:41,829
Like there are console and crossplay have always been married together because we want

707
00:49:41,849 --> 00:49:43,150
to bring people together.

708
00:49:43,430 --> 00:49:45,331
And we're really fortunate in that.

709
00:49:46,980 --> 00:49:51,384
First party being Microsoft and Sony, and Epic all believed in that vision, and we worked

710
00:49:51,424 --> 00:49:52,425
together to make it happen.

711
00:49:53,265 --> 00:49:55,207
Do you think that would have been possible if you hadn't worked with Epic?

712
00:49:57,949 --> 00:49:58,829
It's a tough question.

713
00:49:58,890 --> 00:50:02,012
I mean, it's kind of a what-if scenario.

714
00:50:02,893 --> 00:50:05,395
I mean, everyone at Epic was super supportive.

715
00:50:06,195 --> 00:50:12,600
I also don't want to undermine our own capabilities as a publisher and a developer to get stuff

716
00:50:12,620 --> 00:50:12,820
done.

717
00:50:15,172 --> 00:50:19,694
I mean, like, I don't know if I could say yes or no, but I can say that, like, if we didn't

718
00:50:19,754 --> 00:50:22,495
have Epic, it would have been a monumental task.

719
00:50:22,895 --> 00:50:23,075
For sure.

720
00:50:23,155 --> 00:50:25,136
And they were there to support us every step of the way.

721
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:29,477
Yeah, I ask because, you know, there might be other studios out there that are thinking

722
00:50:29,497 --> 00:50:30,698
about doing cross-play at launch.

723
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:35,839
I sort of try to get a sense of what kind of a task it was, how Herculean, and what

724
00:50:35,859 --> 00:50:36,239
went into it.

725
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:39,621
I wonder, do you have any advice or any tips for other developers who might want to do

726
00:50:39,641 --> 00:50:40,661
the same thing in their own games?

727
00:50:41,361 --> 00:50:43,342
Yeah, I mean, kind of two things.

728
00:50:44,538 --> 00:50:52,724
Working with Epic has been phenomenal, and that's not because I'm being paid to say that.

729
00:50:53,524 --> 00:50:56,246
I love working with those guys. I talk to them every day.

730
00:50:57,607 --> 00:51:03,991
I think what they are trying to do with the Epic Games Store is great for the industry.

731
00:51:04,352 --> 00:51:08,835
They're adding competition to a space that desperately needs it.

732
00:51:09,135 --> 00:51:10,876
Competition only makes us better.

733
00:51:11,777 --> 00:51:13,078
And the way that they treat...

734
00:51:13,425 --> 00:51:18,188
their developers is much more game and developer focused.

735
00:51:18,308 --> 00:51:24,852
I mean, even looking at things like their sliding royalty rate for games.

736
00:51:25,193 --> 00:51:30,696
So for people who don't know, if you want to use the Unreal Engine, you have to pay

737
00:51:30,736 --> 00:51:31,417
to license it.

738
00:51:31,877 --> 00:51:37,321
If you want to publish on the Epic Games Store, they essentially waive the licensing fee.

739
00:51:39,141 --> 00:51:41,863
as a way to deepen your partnership with Epic.

740
00:51:41,943 --> 00:51:43,984
So I am a huge proponent of it.

741
00:51:44,565 --> 00:51:47,066
In terms of the how to get it done,

742
00:51:47,406 --> 00:51:50,949
I think we are at a tipping point in the industry

743
00:51:51,089 --> 00:51:54,991
where games like Fortnite, Rocket League,

744
00:51:55,211 --> 00:51:57,813
I believe Minecraft has some elements of cross-play,

745
00:51:58,914 --> 00:52:01,576
Dauntless, and I believe Call of Duty

746
00:52:01,616 --> 00:52:04,918
also announced cross-play at E3 a couple weeks ago as well.

747
00:52:05,369 --> 00:52:08,631
Like the more games that have it, the more of a precedent it sets.

748
00:52:08,791 --> 00:52:13,614
And I think the more player expectations will be set there.

749
00:52:13,634 --> 00:52:18,636
And I think that again, that's all just going to make us better as an industry.

750
00:52:18,656 --> 00:52:22,138
And I think there's a since there's a path there now, right?

751
00:52:22,158 --> 00:52:24,139
Like and there was not a path there.

752
00:52:24,359 --> 00:52:28,602
Like when even when Dauntless was like just getting started.

753
00:52:28,682 --> 00:52:31,463
Right. That was not like a dream that you could necessarily have.

754
00:52:32,834 --> 00:52:36,675
It is so much easier of a thing to think about from the beginning.

755
00:52:37,975 --> 00:52:42,456
To my point about technology and like design choices

756
00:52:42,476 --> 00:52:47,037
and just being able to accommodate multiple platforms like now games can start

757
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:51,899
and be and be and be built from the ground up as a cross play

758
00:52:53,059 --> 00:52:56,640
cross play experience, which is a super cool place to be,

759
00:52:56,740 --> 00:52:59,120
you know, in the evolution of our industry.

760
00:52:59,140 --> 00:53:01,541
I think it's going to also just.

761
00:53:02,402 --> 00:53:08,348
open up much more social games in general. You can just build it from the ground up knowing that

762
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:15,194
you'll be able to do this thing on this phone and also on this Xbox. That's a new design space that

763
00:53:15,254 --> 00:53:21,900
we are just dipping our toe into, it feels. Yeah, I hope you're right. We've got to wrap

764
00:53:21,940 --> 00:53:25,683
this up. We've got about five minutes. So anyone has any good questions, drop them in chat. We'll

765
00:53:25,723 --> 00:53:29,806
do our best to get them in. Brian, how are you feeling? Do you have any burning questions?

766
00:53:30,037 --> 00:53:30,919
No, I'm feeling good.

767
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:35,085
I'm just hoping, unfortunately I'm not going to start another hunt before we go because

768
00:53:35,566 --> 00:53:37,088
these hunts are wonderful but they also take time.

769
00:53:38,029 --> 00:53:40,413
Thank you everyone in chat for reminding me about the reloading speed.

770
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:43,461
They have a lot of feelings about it.

771
00:53:43,541 --> 00:53:45,101
I'm a pro gamer, guys.

772
00:53:45,501 --> 00:53:46,361
Yeah.

773
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:48,241
Like and subscribe to this channel.

774
00:53:48,641 --> 00:53:49,682
You can tell because he's on Twitch.

775
00:53:49,842 --> 00:53:51,842
I guess we can humor everyone.

776
00:53:52,122 --> 00:53:53,702
Man, I had a question about roadmaps, I guess.

777
00:53:54,082 --> 00:53:57,143
But I think we should humor chat with one question.

778
00:53:57,163 --> 00:53:59,003
There's some questions about a God Hand fix.

779
00:54:00,783 --> 00:54:02,724
Do you all have any opinions about God Hand?

780
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:04,124
Tell me about God Hand.

781
00:54:04,404 --> 00:54:06,024
I'll tell you about God Hand.

782
00:54:06,064 --> 00:54:07,064
I've heard about God Hand.

783
00:54:07,425 --> 00:54:11,885
The God Hand is an exotic weapon in Dauntless that lets you fire a laser beam.

784
00:54:13,463 --> 00:54:17,926
And it's very cool, and also it's a little broke right now, and in our next patch it's fixed.

785
00:54:19,466 --> 00:54:23,248
But the real bad thing is just that you could shoot that beam forever.

786
00:54:25,870 --> 00:54:27,150
So enjoy that while it lasts.

787
00:54:28,111 --> 00:54:30,592
And while it lasts I think we're patching tomorrow.

788
00:54:30,612 --> 00:54:32,953
It's literally a matter of hours.

789
00:54:33,813 --> 00:54:34,254
Perfect.

790
00:54:34,574 --> 00:54:37,355
What inspired the god hand for our last five minutes?

791
00:54:39,127 --> 00:54:46,449
So we have this, we really wanted chase loot in the game. So it's like, oh, this weapon feels really,

792
00:54:46,489 --> 00:54:53,112
really different. And part of that is, I think, partially inspired by Destiny Exotics.

793
00:54:53,912 --> 00:54:58,554
Like they're just like super fun to collect this weapon. It has this like unique behavior and,

794
00:54:58,694 --> 00:55:03,096
you know, unique art. And it feels like this little special thing that I like stumbled across

795
00:55:03,196 --> 00:55:05,177
and now is like uniquely mine.

796
00:55:06,469 --> 00:55:12,270
And so we have exotics that people can try to farm, you know, blueprints for later in the game.

797
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:17,852
So you have to go up against the hardest behemoths over and over to be able to have a chance of getting those exotics.

798
00:55:17,972 --> 00:55:24,414
And the pike, I'm not sure if we saw it on stream or not, the pike also shoots a rocket.

799
00:55:24,734 --> 00:55:31,356
So you stab, stab, stab, charge up your ammo, and then you can shoot a rocket, which interrupts behemoths, deals damage, etc.

800
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:33,857
But it replaces the rocket with a beam instead.

801
00:55:34,277 --> 00:55:34,657
We like it.

802
00:55:35,364 --> 00:55:40,286
In the same way that we like behemoth encounters to be modular,

803
00:55:40,366 --> 00:55:42,427
such that we can remix them in interesting ways,

804
00:55:42,847 --> 00:55:48,730
we just released our weapon customization system,

805
00:55:48,850 --> 00:55:53,352
so you can unlock mods that let you tweak passive behavior of weapons.

806
00:55:53,412 --> 00:55:54,392
So we also unlocked...

807
00:55:56,053 --> 00:55:57,954
Unloshed.

808
00:55:58,014 --> 00:56:00,215
That's my own unloshed mod.

809
00:56:00,235 --> 00:56:01,395
We're almost to launch, I promise.

810
00:56:04,689 --> 00:56:07,591
We let you be able to swap the specials.

811
00:56:07,671 --> 00:56:10,553
So instead of shooting a rocket, you're able to do like this,

812
00:56:11,474 --> 00:56:15,856
this big buff zone if you want to play a more support style with the weapon

813
00:56:15,896 --> 00:56:19,218
instead, because we find that people really gravitate towards a weapon

814
00:56:20,019 --> 00:56:20,559
in the same way.

815
00:56:20,599 --> 00:56:23,721
That's like, I really like to play mage or I really like to play rogue.

816
00:56:23,901 --> 00:56:26,783
It's like, I really I'm a pike user and we want to offer

817
00:56:26,843 --> 00:56:29,365
as many choices to those pike users as possible.

818
00:56:29,745 --> 00:56:31,526
We don't want to have like.

819
00:56:32,320 --> 00:56:34,021
30 weapons and they're all really shallow.

820
00:56:34,281 --> 00:56:38,843
Because people identify so much with their weapon and that playstyle that it affords,

821
00:56:39,123 --> 00:56:41,544
we want all of the weapons to actually go really deep.

822
00:56:42,345 --> 00:56:43,925
So we're trying to introduce more weapons,

823
00:56:43,965 --> 00:56:47,146
but we're also trying to enrich those weapon playstyles over time.

824
00:56:47,507 --> 00:56:48,747
That's a far more...

825
00:56:49,385 --> 00:56:52,005
Ramply answer to what's a god hand?

826
00:56:53,525 --> 00:56:56,386
Nothing what's a god hand with you with that amazing joke

827
00:56:56,406 --> 00:57:03,007
I'm gonna start shutting us down even though I have more questions that I want to ask the chat has some great questions

828
00:57:04,307 --> 00:57:08,368
Thank you all for watching. Thank you all for joining us on the GC twitch channel. We super loved having you

829
00:57:08,708 --> 00:57:11,429
Thank you to the dauntless player base for dropping by and asking questions

830
00:57:11,449 --> 00:57:16,530
Thank you for our normal viewers for coming by and asking questions if you liked this channel if you'd like

831
00:57:18,511 --> 00:57:23,854
If you're a bouncing goat, which I'm just learning about in chat from some gifs earlier today,

832
00:57:24,855 --> 00:57:29,978
but you also love game development, please click the follow button because we are going live

833
00:57:30,318 --> 00:57:33,620
with lots of other interesting games throughout the summer, throughout the fall, throughout the winter.

834
00:57:34,761 --> 00:57:37,082
As long as they keep letting me do it, I'm going to keep doing it.

835
00:57:37,102 --> 00:57:40,945
I'm going to keep asking developers questions and try and get interesting answers for you

836
00:57:41,145 --> 00:57:45,788
and share knowledge, help other game developers make games. That's kind of our goal here.

837
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:52,179
If you have other questions, I've seen some stuff, there's some more god hand-ish questions around here.

838
00:57:52,580 --> 00:57:53,620
Andy, where should they ask him?

839
00:57:54,901 --> 00:58:01,704
Go to our Twitter, play Dauntless. You can also go to our Reddit and our Discord. We have pretty active communities in both.

840
00:58:02,113 --> 00:58:05,175
Right on. We would encourage you all to check those out.

841
00:58:06,516 --> 00:58:10,098
And from there, all I'll say is, because this is GDC,

842
00:58:10,478 --> 00:58:13,920
we've got a long ways off to the next GDC. Feel free, if you want to learn more,

843
00:58:14,061 --> 00:58:17,643
I don't know if there are any Dauntless devs who've given GDC talks,

844
00:58:17,683 --> 00:58:19,304
but there might be some in GDC Vault.

845
00:58:19,324 --> 00:58:20,965
Yep, we've done a couple.

846
00:58:21,305 --> 00:58:24,888
Yeah, they're in GDC Vault. If not, they might even be on the GDC YouTube channel.

847
00:58:26,389 --> 00:58:30,453
And also, you know, you can join us at GDC next year if you are a VR developer.

848
00:58:30,473 --> 00:58:33,977
If you're working in VR or AR, we do have XRDC coming up at the end of the year.

849
00:58:33,997 --> 00:58:34,898
We'd love to see you there.

850
00:58:36,139 --> 00:58:37,721
With that, that's all I got.

851
00:58:38,181 --> 00:58:38,942
Have a good day, everyone.

852
00:58:40,223 --> 00:58:40,904
Hey, thanks for having us.

853
00:58:40,944 --> 00:58:42,205
Thanks for having us, absolutely.

854
00:58:42,426 --> 00:58:43,126
Thanks for coming.

855
00:58:43,427 --> 00:58:43,947
Bye, guys.

856
00:58:44,488 --> 00:58:44,688
Bye.

857
00:58:45,789 --> 00:58:46,290
Play God Hand.
