Hello, my name is Tatiana Villela-Dos Santos.

2
00:00:03,510 --> 00:00:07,171
I'm a game designer and digital artist based in Paris, France.

3
00:00:07,851 --> 00:00:14,434
And I'll give a talk at the GDC this year about my works called Game Design Beyond Screens and Joysticks.

4
00:00:15,234 --> 00:00:20,076
I make games with alternative controllers or as interactive installations.

5
00:00:20,576 --> 00:00:22,957
Sometimes even immersive rooms with performers.

6
00:00:23,417 --> 00:00:26,738
Basically, any game that works with an uncommon interface.

7
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:35,554
I make most of my games in artist residencies, and then I exhibit them in different places around the world, from galleries to clubs.

8
00:00:36,194 --> 00:00:44,618
Designing with the freedom of a contemporary artist allowed me to develop my own tools and methods to create this specific kind of game,

9
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:52,082
including in my researches not only the digital part of the experience, but also the ones staged in the physical space.

10
00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:56,564
And especially how to use interfaces to shape players' behavior.

11
00:00:57,284 --> 00:01:02,536
If you are curious about my works, you can have a look at my website, makeburn.fr.

12
00:01:03,178 --> 00:01:05,824
Looking forward to see you all at the GDC.

13
00:01:06,365 --> 00:01:06,666
Bye!
