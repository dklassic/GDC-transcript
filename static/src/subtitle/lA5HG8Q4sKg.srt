1
00:00:05,404 --> 00:00:06,765
So we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:07,426 --> 00:00:11,429
And I want to welcome you guys to the panel

3
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:13,851
for creating compelling characters.

4
00:00:13,931 --> 00:00:17,694
I'm super geeked to have brought some of these artists

5
00:00:17,774 --> 00:00:19,175
up here to help talk about what they do.

6
00:00:20,156 --> 00:00:22,258
And let's see, people are still filing in.

7
00:00:23,159 --> 00:00:25,700
So if a lot of them start coming down the aisle,

8
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:28,142
they've asked that you kind of squeeze in a little bit

9
00:00:28,162 --> 00:00:29,262
to make room for everybody else.

10
00:00:30,083 --> 00:00:31,304
So my name is Justin Tavrat.

11
00:00:31,724 --> 00:00:35,707
I help out as an art department supervisor over at Blizzard.

12
00:00:35,987 --> 00:00:39,369
And we were really excited to do this panel, right?

13
00:00:39,389 --> 00:00:43,011
Because creating compelling characters

14
00:00:43,191 --> 00:00:46,293
is a really important part of a lot of game development.

15
00:00:46,842 --> 00:00:48,362
And there's so many different ways to do it,

16
00:00:48,402 --> 00:00:50,103
depending on the type of game and the style.

17
00:00:50,403 --> 00:00:54,185
There's no one perfect, optimal way to design characters.

18
00:00:54,205 --> 00:00:57,007
So what we were able to do is get a lot of talented people

19
00:00:57,527 --> 00:00:59,748
up here to talk about their different techniques

20
00:00:59,928 --> 00:01:01,749
and styles, approaches, and philosophies,

21
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:05,211
and help share that with you here today.

22
00:01:05,471 --> 00:01:07,532
So with that,

23
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:10,531
What else?

24
00:01:10,611 --> 00:01:13,794
So also with the evaluation forms,

25
00:01:14,195 --> 00:01:16,957
please make sure to fill those out at the end of the session

26
00:01:16,997 --> 00:01:17,938
with that email that you get.

27
00:01:18,719 --> 00:01:21,222
I help out on the GDC advisory board,

28
00:01:21,242 --> 00:01:22,523
so for the visual arts track.

29
00:01:22,964 --> 00:01:25,466
And we're always looking at ways to improve the content

30
00:01:25,806 --> 00:01:27,348
for the VA track at GDC.

31
00:01:28,449 --> 00:01:31,351
If you like this kind of material, if you enjoyed this, please let us know.

32
00:01:31,891 --> 00:01:36,173
If there are ways that you feel we can improve it or how to plus it for next

33
00:01:36,213 --> 00:01:37,754
time, let us know as well.

34
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:41,816
We want to, we want to help make the content for the VA track applicable,

35
00:01:42,336 --> 00:01:43,897
awesome, fun, inspiring stuff.

36
00:01:44,697 --> 00:01:46,818
So, uh, what else?

37
00:01:46,838 --> 00:01:50,140
I think that's it.

38
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:50,780
All right.

39
00:01:51,180 --> 00:01:54,021
We're going to get started here and first up.

40
00:01:56,860 --> 00:01:58,921
We have Richard from Naughty Dog.

41
00:01:58,941 --> 00:01:58,981
Hi.

42
00:01:59,001 --> 00:01:59,041
Hi.

43
00:01:59,061 --> 00:01:59,121
Hi.

44
00:01:59,141 --> 00:01:59,181
Hi.

45
00:02:04,863 --> 00:02:04,983
Hi.

46
00:02:05,684 --> 00:02:05,744
Hi.

47
00:02:05,764 --> 00:02:05,824
Hi.

48
00:02:05,844 --> 00:02:05,884
Hi.

49
00:02:07,564 --> 00:02:08,164
Sorry, is that working?

50
00:02:08,184 --> 00:02:08,605
Can you hear me?

51
00:02:09,825 --> 00:02:10,905
All right, my name's Richard Lyons.

52
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:14,707
I'm a concept, character concept artist at Naughty Dog.

53
00:02:15,867 --> 00:02:17,568
Been there for the last three years,

54
00:02:17,808 --> 00:02:19,129
working through Uncharted 4,

55
00:02:19,889 --> 00:02:21,549
and now working on The Lost Legacy

56
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:23,930
and The Last of Us Part II.

57
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:33,305
I wanted to talk to you guys today about showing your characters in context and how that can

58
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:39,190
avoid some pitfalls of stereotypes.

59
00:02:51,724 --> 00:02:55,205
relying on cliches and sort of tropes that go into character design.

60
00:02:55,845 --> 00:02:58,726
So before we concentrate on this, I wanted to tell a little story.

61
00:02:59,246 --> 00:03:03,588
The other day I was tasked with concepting a tough guy,

62
00:03:03,648 --> 00:03:06,468
a strong, intimidating, physical character.

63
00:03:07,789 --> 00:03:11,470
So I went about it the normal way, probably most of us here have been taught.

64
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,171
How many here are concept artists at the moment?

65
00:03:15,691 --> 00:03:18,992
Oh, sweet. And character artists? Yeah, awesome.

66
00:03:19,743 --> 00:03:21,784
So essentially, for the most part,

67
00:03:21,824 --> 00:03:24,026
we're taught to present our characters in a lineup.

68
00:03:24,086 --> 00:03:25,507
It's a flat background,

69
00:03:26,967 --> 00:03:28,789
showing different costume designs as we go.

70
00:03:29,389 --> 00:03:31,790
So I did my tough guy, as we all do,

71
00:03:31,871 --> 00:03:36,313
big barrel chest, square jaw, big pose, clinch fists,

72
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:38,835
and presented my costumes.

73
00:03:39,816 --> 00:03:42,237
One of the costumes had him wearing glasses,

74
00:03:43,158 --> 00:03:44,859
and I was showing it to a group of people,

75
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:47,220
creative directors, designers, and a bunch of other people.

76
00:03:48,907 --> 00:03:51,550
Their reaction to the glasses was interesting to me.

77
00:03:51,590 --> 00:03:53,271
When they saw that, they said, no, no, no, no,

78
00:03:53,332 --> 00:03:54,493
he can't be wearing glasses.

79
00:03:55,273 --> 00:03:57,355
That's not indicative of a tough guy.

80
00:03:57,976 --> 00:03:59,778
And instantly alarm bells are ringing for me

81
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:02,901
that I'm not showing these people enough.

82
00:04:02,921 --> 00:04:04,362
They're not seeing enough of the puzzle

83
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,964
for them to make a decision.

84
00:04:06,638 --> 00:04:10,320
about what this character is going to be and what they're going to wear and how we're going to present them.

85
00:04:10,661 --> 00:04:13,082
They're basically trying to tell the whole story at a glance,

86
00:04:14,442 --> 00:04:16,203
based on shape, language and everything else.

87
00:04:16,544 --> 00:04:17,564
Which is great for a lot of games.

88
00:04:17,764 --> 00:04:19,705
You know, Team Fortress 2, at a glance.

89
00:04:19,725 --> 00:04:21,526
The big heavy guy moves slow, hits hard.

90
00:04:21,926 --> 00:04:23,667
But when you're working on games like Uncharted 4,

91
00:04:24,868 --> 00:04:28,950
The Last of Us, where the intentions of the character are totally ambiguous,

92
00:04:29,730 --> 00:04:33,052
or we don't even want that character to be reading that way at this point,

93
00:04:33,072 --> 00:04:34,913
but we want them to read another way at another point.

94
00:04:35,775 --> 00:04:38,537
all of these kind of cliches and stereotypes sort of fall apart.

95
00:04:38,697 --> 00:04:41,519
So, today I'm going to show a new process that I've been using.

96
00:04:41,559 --> 00:04:43,801
It's still a work in progress, but I'm getting some good results,

97
00:04:44,081 --> 00:04:46,302
including that character now wears glasses.

98
00:04:48,824 --> 00:04:53,107
The first thing is our games are realistic character narrative-driven games.

99
00:04:53,607 --> 00:04:56,289
So, the first thing I do is I sit down and I plot out my narrative.

100
00:04:56,770 --> 00:05:00,472
So, at the moment we're going to use the storyline of Stephen King's Carrie.

101
00:05:01,293 --> 00:05:03,914
Spoilers, if you haven't seen Carrie, I'm about to spoil a story for you.

102
00:05:06,224 --> 00:05:11,027
about a telekinetic, magic-powered girl, high school girl.

103
00:05:11,628 --> 00:05:14,629
She goes to school, she's ostracized, she's bullied,

104
00:05:15,730 --> 00:05:17,071
and eventually she's pushed too far

105
00:05:17,131 --> 00:05:20,633
and she murders all her peers with her telekinetic powers.

106
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:24,516
So this is what I do, is I basically plot out my plot line,

107
00:05:24,536 --> 00:05:26,837
and you can see these little storyboards over here.

108
00:05:27,342 --> 00:05:31,405
The first one, she starts at a new school, she's optimistic, she's happy, she's picked

109
00:05:31,465 --> 00:05:34,868
on a little bit, she starts to be intimidated and starts to be scared.

110
00:05:35,188 --> 00:05:37,810
She's ostracized by her peers, so she's alone.

111
00:05:39,111 --> 00:05:42,834
She's then physically assaulted, and in Carrie there's the famous blood pouring on the head.

112
00:05:42,894 --> 00:05:44,395
I just had her in this one getting beat up.

113
00:05:45,376 --> 00:05:52,181
And then she unleashes her revenge and is empowered and murders everyone with her telekinetic

114
00:05:52,221 --> 00:05:52,541
powers.

115
00:05:53,042 --> 00:05:54,223
So this is the first thing I do.

116
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:59,744
I gather reference and create a little line up based on that.

117
00:05:59,804 --> 00:06:03,627
So we're looking at a whole bunch of reference here and already we can see pitfalls that

118
00:06:03,648 --> 00:06:04,788
we probably want to avoid.

119
00:06:04,848 --> 00:06:10,513
There's some really great characters in Ralph Macchio for the outsiders and some other complex

120
00:06:10,553 --> 00:06:10,973
characters.

121
00:06:11,013 --> 00:06:12,474
There's Carrie over there in the top left.

122
00:06:13,635 --> 00:06:17,478
And then you've got some pretty corny ones that aren't funny until you've had 20 beers

123
00:06:17,538 --> 00:06:19,820
like Revenge of the Nerds and some other ones like that.

124
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:20,481
Breakfast Club.

125
00:06:21,905 --> 00:06:24,667
At this point, you can already see that there's going to be things that people are going to

126
00:06:24,687 --> 00:06:26,028
respond to instantly.

127
00:06:26,228 --> 00:06:29,329
And if you wanted to take the cheap way out, sure, you could dress them like Revenge of

128
00:06:29,349 --> 00:06:29,709
the Nerds.

129
00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:35,012
Everyone knows that person's going to be ostracized according to some shape language invented

130
00:06:35,052 --> 00:06:35,773
in the 80s.

131
00:06:37,634 --> 00:06:41,896
So I create a little lineup at this point, going from one side to the other, trying to

132
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:44,957
keep it fairly natural, but there's a few characters in there that you feel in the right

133
00:06:44,997 --> 00:06:48,299
circumstances might be ostracized.

134
00:06:48,885 --> 00:06:54,009
I've chosen this character because she's cute, she's small, she's not physically empowered,

135
00:06:55,269 --> 00:06:59,252
and hopefully because she is cute, you're going to feel some kind of protective instinct

136
00:06:59,272 --> 00:06:59,492
to her.

137
00:07:00,273 --> 00:07:05,216
So the next thing I do is I choose one of my plot points, because this is going to be

138
00:07:05,236 --> 00:07:05,756
our costume.

139
00:07:05,776 --> 00:07:08,338
These are thematical beats throughout the game.

140
00:07:08,358 --> 00:07:11,740
For us, it's very cinematic, so I'm always picturing it like a film.

141
00:07:14,102 --> 00:07:17,764
What is this person going to be wearing in each scene starts to matter.

142
00:07:19,382 --> 00:07:20,442
Oh, there's one missing here.

143
00:07:20,462 --> 00:07:22,382
So I've chosen a character at this point.

144
00:07:24,203 --> 00:07:25,943
So let's look at these ones

145
00:07:25,963 --> 00:07:27,784
and we choose a few of these scenes

146
00:07:28,584 --> 00:07:30,225
and we start slotting in our characters.

147
00:07:30,805 --> 00:07:34,386
And we can see already that less and less has to be,

148
00:07:35,286 --> 00:07:36,526
there's less and less pressure

149
00:07:36,887 --> 00:07:39,087
on what the character is wearing in isolation.

150
00:07:39,587 --> 00:07:41,008
Because we can already see from this scene

151
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:44,329
that she's pressured by the way she's framed.

152
00:07:44,369 --> 00:07:46,349
The bully is filling the majority of the frame.

153
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:47,750
She's squeezed over to one side.

154
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:49,721
We see expression, we see lighting.

155
00:07:50,282 --> 00:07:51,943
So the creative director and art directors,

156
00:07:51,963 --> 00:07:53,044
when they look at these shots,

157
00:07:53,705 --> 00:07:56,287
are able to understand a little bit more about the character

158
00:07:56,908 --> 00:07:58,850
and they don't have to rely on so many tropes.

159
00:08:01,172 --> 00:08:02,994
So as we go through the shot, you realize,

160
00:08:03,094 --> 00:08:05,636
hey, maybe some of these character types

161
00:08:05,696 --> 00:08:06,697
are a little bit heavy handed.

162
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:08,671
So for me, I chose this one here.

163
00:08:08,711 --> 00:08:09,792
I felt she was natural.

164
00:08:09,872 --> 00:08:12,415
She still looks, she still looks scared.

165
00:08:12,955 --> 00:08:15,478
Our framing technique has made sure she looks pressured.

166
00:08:15,818 --> 00:08:17,800
Our camera is with her at chest height.

167
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:21,203
So as an audience, we understand that we're with her

168
00:08:21,263 --> 00:08:22,084
in this experience.

169
00:08:24,306 --> 00:08:25,927
And at this point, you can already see

170
00:08:25,948 --> 00:08:27,789
that someone has to make a decision about a costume.

171
00:08:28,491 --> 00:08:31,373
looking at these has a little bit more information.

172
00:08:31,693 --> 00:08:34,014
So all of a sudden, these are less impactful.

173
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,135
This is just more like, hey, this is the blueprint.

174
00:08:36,375 --> 00:08:38,517
This might even be the first step of the character sheet.

175
00:08:39,197 --> 00:08:41,058
These are what the creative directors are gonna look at.

176
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,760
So we can even just like swap the character out altogether.

177
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:48,442
It doesn't have to be a small, cute girl anymore.

178
00:08:48,642 --> 00:08:50,823
It can just be this dude, this Ralph Manchio looking dude.

179
00:08:51,164 --> 00:08:53,125
And still he looks pressured, he looks bullied.

180
00:08:53,465 --> 00:08:55,446
All of a sudden, the stereotypes are completely gone.

181
00:08:57,574 --> 00:09:01,215
So from there, if we go back and we look at our whole lineup,

182
00:09:02,115 --> 00:09:05,896
I go through each scene and I start blocking shots off.

183
00:09:06,537 --> 00:09:07,537
So if we look at these, we've got,

184
00:09:07,857 --> 00:09:09,157
she starts a new day at school.

185
00:09:10,278 --> 00:09:11,778
You know, it's a pretty standard framing.

186
00:09:12,218 --> 00:09:13,819
She looks nice, she's having a good time.

187
00:09:13,859 --> 00:09:15,099
The camera's a little bit low.

188
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,579
She's slightly empowered.

189
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:17,240
Perfect.

190
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,080
Next shot, she's getting bullied.

191
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:20,060
Just went through that one.

192
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,641
Next shot, she's ostracized.

193
00:09:22,881 --> 00:09:24,261
I mean, these are super simple things.

194
00:09:24,301 --> 00:09:25,882
I mean, there's no background in this one.

195
00:09:26,042 --> 00:09:27,322
For a lot of them, I'm just grabbing a photo

196
00:09:27,362 --> 00:09:28,523
and blurring it in the background.

197
00:09:30,284 --> 00:09:31,524
But for this one, it tells a lot.

198
00:09:31,544 --> 00:09:32,624
You know, there's a composition there

199
00:09:32,644 --> 00:09:33,725
where she feels ostracized.

200
00:09:34,285 --> 00:09:35,625
And we've got other things coming through,

201
00:09:35,665 --> 00:09:37,106
different costume designs as well.

202
00:09:37,206 --> 00:09:38,787
She's got her hands in her pockets in this one.

203
00:09:39,547 --> 00:09:42,188
And for the technical rigors and things out there,

204
00:09:42,228 --> 00:09:44,388
the scarf and the hair and the hands in the pockets

205
00:09:44,449 --> 00:09:46,349
is gonna be an immediate red flag.

206
00:09:48,430 --> 00:09:49,510
A light nod, you know.

207
00:09:50,437 --> 00:09:53,259
We have this one where she's finally physically assaulted,

208
00:09:54,199 --> 00:09:56,160
and she's terrified, framing again.

209
00:09:56,180 --> 00:09:59,122
And then we have the last one where she unleashes her power

210
00:09:59,142 --> 00:10:00,483
and gets her revenge on these bullies.

211
00:10:01,964 --> 00:10:05,466
And already we can see we've got multiple different frames,

212
00:10:05,546 --> 00:10:06,546
multiple different attitudes,

213
00:10:06,566 --> 00:10:09,408
multiple different themes coming through this one costume.

214
00:10:10,929 --> 00:10:11,969
So if we just break these down,

215
00:10:11,989 --> 00:10:13,590
I've got a quick little breakdown for them.

216
00:10:13,610 --> 00:10:14,391
So it starts in your school,

217
00:10:14,411 --> 00:10:17,713
we've got hopeful, nervous, excited.

218
00:10:19,587 --> 00:10:21,148
So we've got center frame, medium shot,

219
00:10:21,188 --> 00:10:24,031
she's just off center, we've got chest-height camera.

220
00:10:24,491 --> 00:10:25,592
So it's a pretty standard shot.

221
00:10:25,612 --> 00:10:27,734
I've got a little indication that she's talking to someone

222
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:28,955
with a little out-of-focus thing

223
00:10:28,975 --> 00:10:30,557
in the bottom left-hand side.

224
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:33,960
The next shot, we went through this one,

225
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:36,422
she's bullied, she's trapped, she's worried.

226
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:38,644
We can see here, I've trapped her

227
00:10:38,664 --> 00:10:39,965
in the right-hand side of the frame,

228
00:10:40,326 --> 00:10:41,707
the bully taking up most of the shot,

229
00:10:42,168 --> 00:10:43,269
chest-height camera again,

230
00:10:43,289 --> 00:10:45,170
as an audience, we're with her in this one.

231
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,662
ostracized by the peers, she's lonely, withdrawn.

232
00:10:49,682 --> 00:10:52,403
We've got a contrasting space

233
00:10:53,224 --> 00:10:56,266
and we've crocking out the NPCs

234
00:10:56,286 --> 00:10:57,647
and we're pulling focus on her.

235
00:10:58,367 --> 00:11:00,288
Again, it's a really powerful one,

236
00:11:00,328 --> 00:11:03,370
like being ostracized in a crowd or lonely in a crowd,

237
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,911
I think is a really powerful vision.

238
00:11:06,487 --> 00:11:09,228
For this one here, we've got scared, in pain, intimidated,

239
00:11:09,589 --> 00:11:10,589
pretty obvious again,

240
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:12,771
she's pressured into one side of the screen.

241
00:11:13,351 --> 00:11:15,032
We've got parts of the bully in the foreground

242
00:11:15,072 --> 00:11:16,693
actually crossing into her face,

243
00:11:17,134 --> 00:11:18,474
which is also very powerful.

244
00:11:19,335 --> 00:11:21,016
And we've pulled the camera in a lot tighter.

245
00:11:21,577 --> 00:11:22,897
So this is a lot more intense,

246
00:11:23,258 --> 00:11:26,059
and as an audience, we're with her at this point.

247
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:27,721
These are all fairly obvious things

248
00:11:27,781 --> 00:11:30,102
were for people that are involved in cinematography.

249
00:11:31,023 --> 00:11:33,484
But I think for me, this is the type of stuff

250
00:11:33,524 --> 00:11:34,565
that over the last couple of years,

251
00:11:34,605 --> 00:11:35,846
I've become fascinated with.

252
00:11:36,435 --> 00:11:39,478
because it's empowered me to present my characters

253
00:11:39,518 --> 00:11:42,320
in a different way, as opposed to just that lineup.

254
00:11:44,222 --> 00:11:45,523
And with the last one, of course,

255
00:11:45,563 --> 00:11:47,925
she's empowered, possessed, focused.

256
00:11:49,226 --> 00:11:51,808
So we've got a center frame, she feels the frame,

257
00:11:52,288 --> 00:11:55,351
camera's looking up at her, so we're basically seeing

258
00:11:55,371 --> 00:11:57,913
the view of the victims that she's now terrorizing.

259
00:11:58,894 --> 00:12:02,176
It's a really powerful and super easy technique.

260
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:04,018
This is actually the same kind of framing

261
00:12:04,058 --> 00:12:05,960
for my character with the glasses.

262
00:12:06,534 --> 00:12:10,998
that I put him in. It was centre frame. He was even like popping out the top of the frame.

263
00:12:11,018 --> 00:12:15,062
He had his hands crossed and he's looking down across his glasses. Instantly everyone

264
00:12:15,122 --> 00:12:18,445
fell in love with it. When earlier in the day, everyone was telling me it's not going

265
00:12:18,465 --> 00:12:21,688
to fly. So it's an interesting contrast there in how he presented.

266
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:29,835
Yeah, just swiping through these two, I mean, this is the same character. And if we look

267
00:12:29,855 --> 00:12:32,757
at the line-up, you know, you're not getting this information.

268
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,060
I think these two are probably the two most contrasting.

269
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:38,460
The other little thing that comes up, and I saw the hands go up,

270
00:12:38,500 --> 00:12:41,001
have we got technical artists here, technical riggers or anything?

271
00:12:41,701 --> 00:12:43,521
Yeah, you guys are worth your money.

272
00:12:45,722 --> 00:12:48,042
So, instantly there's a whole bunch of flags that go up.

273
00:12:48,082 --> 00:12:51,143
We're looking at her costume, we've got her in a backpack at the start,

274
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:54,043
so that's one actor, she's wearing the scarf, the jacket.

275
00:12:55,163 --> 00:12:58,344
The next shot, we've got her hands in her pockets, seems simple,

276
00:12:58,764 --> 00:13:01,065
it's probably not, especially if you wanted to have it in real time.

277
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:05,753
She's got a scarf, she's now using it almost like a turtleneck, her head's being brought

278
00:13:05,793 --> 00:13:08,954
into it, her hair, how is that going to interact with the actual scarf?

279
00:13:09,575 --> 00:13:13,076
Really nice thematical thing with the scarf actually going through.

280
00:13:13,096 --> 00:13:18,178
Next one, blood, tears, how is your team going to present that?

281
00:13:18,259 --> 00:13:21,720
How's your FX team, how's your character team going to work out how that's done?

282
00:13:22,821 --> 00:13:26,522
And the last one, probably is going to be the more difficult one, is her scarf's going

283
00:13:26,542 --> 00:13:28,963
to unwrap, flap around in the air.

284
00:13:29,340 --> 00:13:32,942
Her hair's going to fly around the place and then she has two flaps for a jacket flying

285
00:13:32,982 --> 00:13:33,502
around as well.

286
00:13:34,463 --> 00:13:40,285
So all of these are probably going to be different models, different actors, whatever terminology

287
00:13:40,305 --> 00:13:41,265
you use in your studio.

288
00:13:42,946 --> 00:13:47,388
And trying to work that stuff out is a lot of work for a lot of people.

289
00:13:47,708 --> 00:13:52,450
So already we're hitting on so many points and all we're trying to do is present a costume

290
00:13:52,690 --> 00:13:54,391
and already there's a whole bunch of information there.

291
00:13:55,330 --> 00:13:57,011
These are really quick sketches that I did.

292
00:13:57,291 --> 00:13:59,751
I took photos of my wife for the most part

293
00:14:00,071 --> 00:14:01,411
and just sketched straight over the top.

294
00:14:01,912 --> 00:14:03,432
I dressed her up in what I wanted

295
00:14:03,452 --> 00:14:05,292
and then I sketched straight over the top.

296
00:14:05,332 --> 00:14:06,952
So, you know, I can bang out

297
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,293
maybe a couple of these in a night

298
00:14:09,533 --> 00:14:12,393
and they're just so powerful with presenting a character.

299
00:14:12,433 --> 00:14:16,354
So I highly recommend using a cinematic presentation.

300
00:14:16,734 --> 00:14:18,395
So in closing,

301
00:14:18,415 --> 00:14:22,655
I can ramble about this for hours if you want.

302
00:14:24,548 --> 00:14:30,669
plot your story beats, know your narrative, gather up your reference and create the line

303
00:14:30,709 --> 00:14:35,050
up. Do not present your characters in a line up. You're forcing people to make decisions

304
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:40,392
on one piece of the puzzle and it can lead to some pretty shonky character design later

305
00:14:40,472 --> 00:14:46,893
on. Present your character in a cinematic fashion. So already here this is really interesting

306
00:14:46,933 --> 00:14:48,053
as well. You've got the line up.

307
00:14:48,675 --> 00:14:53,318
to the cinematic. I mean, you can see the level of emotion that's in one is just totally

308
00:14:53,398 --> 00:14:59,062
absent in the other. And that's all. That's my little tip for you.

309
00:15:07,308 --> 00:15:11,651
Thanks, Richard. That was awesome. Very cool. Different way to think about concept and characters

310
00:15:11,671 --> 00:15:17,194
for me. So up next, we have Claire Hummel from Composanto. You guys are in.

311
00:15:18,351 --> 00:15:18,771
for a treat.

312
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:19,352
Oh God.

313
00:15:21,913 --> 00:15:22,914
Set the bar high.

314
00:15:22,934 --> 00:15:26,977
Okay, there you go.

315
00:15:26,997 --> 00:15:29,819
Hi guys, my name is Claire Hummel, as he just said.

316
00:15:30,979 --> 00:15:34,582
I've spent the better part of the past decade working in video games.

317
00:15:34,862 --> 00:15:42,547
I was at Xbox for six-ish years, worked on Fable Legends, Sunset Overdrive, took a side

318
00:15:42,587 --> 00:15:44,368
gig doing stuff for Bioshock Infinite.

319
00:15:45,530 --> 00:15:49,432
Ended up at HBO for two years working on Westworld VR, which was super fun.

320
00:15:50,172 --> 00:15:55,554
And now I'm at Campo Santo doing a lot of very cool, very secret things that I cannot

321
00:15:55,594 --> 00:15:56,015
talk about.

322
00:15:57,115 --> 00:15:57,856
But they'll be great.

323
00:15:58,376 --> 00:16:00,317
Totally as good as Firewatch, I promise.

324
00:16:02,097 --> 00:16:07,760
So what I wanted to talk about is visual narrative through character and costume design.

325
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:12,762
Specifically, kind of focusing on costume design because it is something that I love.

326
00:16:13,903 --> 00:16:20,626
You can really use visuals to display narrative, to display storytelling, and you can effectively

327
00:16:20,686 --> 00:16:25,369
communicate things like personality, social standing, culture, career, etc.

328
00:16:26,329 --> 00:16:28,230
Functionality with the game, obviously.

329
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:32,391
It's especially interesting to see how thoughtful,

330
00:16:32,652 --> 00:16:36,133
thorough research into those areas can really steer you away

331
00:16:36,193 --> 00:16:38,654
from character design tropes that are prevalent in games,

332
00:16:38,754 --> 00:16:42,215
just like Richard was talking about, and helps you kind of end

333
00:16:42,255 --> 00:16:44,055
up with something really unique and ownable,

334
00:16:44,896 --> 00:16:46,716
which is very important in this kind of thing.

335
00:16:47,737 --> 00:16:50,578
So, of course, when you're starting to design characters,

336
00:16:50,818 --> 00:16:53,579
it's very important to determine your setting and universe

337
00:16:53,619 --> 00:16:54,579
that you're designing within.

338
00:16:56,267 --> 00:17:02,732
This kind of goes without saying and sometimes you don't really have control over it if you have an art director, if you have a showrunner, things like that.

339
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:11,600
But it's worth thinking about and really internalizing this information as you're going forward with designing your characters. They don't exist in a vacuum.

340
00:17:13,902 --> 00:17:17,525
Understanding and establishing this grander context kind of

341
00:17:18,022 --> 00:17:21,387
gives you just a way to bounce your character off

342
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,530
of various parameters in a really interesting way.

343
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:26,013
So there are a million different ways

344
00:17:26,073 --> 00:17:27,375
that you can categorize this,

345
00:17:27,535 --> 00:17:29,117
but here are a couple of spectrums, so.

346
00:17:30,003 --> 00:17:33,105
Things like time period and setting obviously make sense.

347
00:17:33,305 --> 00:17:36,567
If it's a historical setting, near future sci-fi,

348
00:17:36,607 --> 00:17:37,128
what have you.

349
00:17:38,008 --> 00:17:41,190
Realistic versus stylized, which kind of explains itself.

350
00:17:41,851 --> 00:17:45,053
Literal versus symbolic, where you either have literal,

351
00:17:45,093 --> 00:17:47,194
very realistic, ripped from the headlines

352
00:17:47,334 --> 00:17:49,976
kind of character designs, like we wear today.

353
00:17:51,216 --> 00:17:53,758
Or if you have very symbolic costume designs,

354
00:17:53,818 --> 00:17:56,219
like what you might see in Fury Road,

355
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:58,701
or Fifth Element, things like that.

356
00:17:59,558 --> 00:18:01,178
And of course, playful versus serious.

357
00:18:01,578 --> 00:18:05,139
There are a lot of games that are stylized but serious

358
00:18:05,459 --> 00:18:08,020
or playful but realistic, that sort of thing.

359
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:10,780
So time period and setting,

360
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:13,961
I'm definitely biased towards historical settings.

361
00:18:14,081 --> 00:18:16,762
It's something I just get a kick out of,

362
00:18:16,842 --> 00:18:19,022
so that's where my particular expertise lies.

363
00:18:19,042 --> 00:18:22,583
It was an interesting challenge working for Westworld VR

364
00:18:23,063 --> 00:18:25,484
because you aren't designing the literal Old West,

365
00:18:25,864 --> 00:18:26,304
you aren't.

366
00:18:26,664 --> 00:18:31,106
designing actual clothing from the 1800s, you're designing a kind of

367
00:18:31,166 --> 00:18:36,648
fantastical near-future theme park version of it. So kind of stylized

368
00:18:36,708 --> 00:18:40,810
symbolic character designs become really important in a way that they might not

369
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:44,371
be if you were designing actual cowboys from 1860 in Nevada.

370
00:18:47,472 --> 00:18:54,916
So there are a lot of character designs in Westworld the show and that we were playing around with in Westworld VR that I would normally despise

371
00:18:55,717 --> 00:19:00,219
But because they're supposed to look tropey because they're supposed to look like they're out of old Westerns

372
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:05,782
They've become really important. You have Hector Escuton in the upper right hand corner there who has this

373
00:19:06,623 --> 00:19:08,644
horrid leather jacket and

374
00:19:09,612 --> 00:19:12,094
stamped leather hat and it's so over the top,

375
00:19:12,114 --> 00:19:14,155
but he's meant to be this over the top villain

376
00:19:14,195 --> 00:19:16,777
who has secret debts, and so it makes sense

377
00:19:16,877 --> 00:19:18,358
for his character in that context.

378
00:19:21,305 --> 00:19:26,529
Realistic versus stylized, again, I draw a lot of Western stuff, apparently, for work and play.

379
00:19:27,889 --> 00:19:35,114
This is Westworld VR on the left, of course, and then some designs that I did while I was at Xbox for Gunpowder.

380
00:19:35,814 --> 00:19:40,197
And so just showing how you can still use the same imagery but really push it in different directions,

381
00:19:40,257 --> 00:19:43,358
depending on the final game that you are making.

382
00:19:45,261 --> 00:19:49,287
Literal versus symbolic, this is not my art, but it seems very relevant.

383
00:19:49,407 --> 00:19:51,831
I love the character designs in Journey.

384
00:19:51,911 --> 00:19:53,794
They are so simple, but so effective.

385
00:19:54,836 --> 00:19:58,842
And I like how this shows relatively, quote-unquote, low-poly, simple.

386
00:19:59,583 --> 00:20:03,887
deceptively simple character designs, but some of them are very symbolic.

387
00:20:03,967 --> 00:20:08,151
There's no one-to-one parallel with things that exist in the real world,

388
00:20:08,391 --> 00:20:09,012
like with Journey.

389
00:20:09,552 --> 00:20:12,975
And then if you're looking at the Overland character designs down below,

390
00:20:13,435 --> 00:20:16,018
much more realistic, much more relatable and

391
00:20:16,338 --> 00:20:20,942
literal clothing that people might actually wear in real life.

392
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:26,001
Some more examples of literal versus symbolic.

393
00:20:26,261 --> 00:20:27,862
The right is for Rai's Son of Rome,

394
00:20:28,282 --> 00:20:30,483
where we're allowed to go completely over the top

395
00:20:30,543 --> 00:20:35,065
with symbolism of the gods, costume drapery, everything.

396
00:20:35,605 --> 00:20:37,386
The stuff on the left is for Power Star Golf.

397
00:20:37,726 --> 00:20:38,826
So it's a chick playing golf.

398
00:20:39,186 --> 00:20:40,767
She's gonna look pretty normal.

399
00:20:42,928 --> 00:20:43,388
Thank you.

400
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:46,369
This is another one.

401
00:20:46,389 --> 00:20:47,850
This is for a project that

402
00:20:49,328 --> 00:20:52,328
Never saw the light of day, but that's okay.

403
00:20:52,589 --> 00:20:53,689
This was a really fun project

404
00:20:53,769 --> 00:20:55,549
because it was about fallen angels

405
00:20:55,589 --> 00:20:57,910
so we could just go nuts with the symbolic imagery

406
00:20:57,970 --> 00:20:59,950
that would not make sense in a realistic narrative.

407
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,351
So you get to make a crazy fallen angel

408
00:21:02,451 --> 00:21:06,591
covered in crying, screaming people motifs in the armor,

409
00:21:06,631 --> 00:21:07,452
which was really fun.

410
00:21:07,472 --> 00:21:11,933
And of course, playful versus serious.

411
00:21:13,398 --> 00:21:16,560
I kind of loved working at Xbox because it meant,

412
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:18,661
because of the team I was on,

413
00:21:18,681 --> 00:21:20,542
I was working on a ton of different properties.

414
00:21:21,162 --> 00:21:24,584
I think by the time I left, I had touched 60 different games,

415
00:21:24,864 --> 00:21:29,466
most of which died, but it was still a great experience.

416
00:21:29,486 --> 00:21:30,487
It was very compelling.

417
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:34,429
And so a lot of them, some of my favorite stuff to work on

418
00:21:34,469 --> 00:21:36,290
was Sunset Overdrive and Fable Legends.

419
00:21:37,130 --> 00:21:42,935
So, Sunset Overdrive was like designing the apocalypse in Spencer's Gifts,

420
00:21:43,275 --> 00:21:44,896
which was really fun to play around with.

421
00:21:45,637 --> 00:21:48,099
And Fable, of course, has this really,

422
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:50,901
it's an established property with a very defined aesthetic.

423
00:21:51,941 --> 00:21:53,643
The shape language of the costumes,

424
00:21:53,683 --> 00:21:58,266
the visual wit that's really represented in the storytelling and the dialogue,

425
00:21:58,606 --> 00:22:03,090
the tropiness of the characters, it's very like classic British fantasy.

426
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,171
It was super fun to play around with.

427
00:22:05,991 --> 00:22:08,131
And then if anyone listens to the Adventure Zone,

428
00:22:08,652 --> 00:22:10,392
that's a drawing of Magnus on the left,

429
00:22:10,772 --> 00:22:11,712
which is really fun,

430
00:22:11,732 --> 00:22:13,413
because it's just a D&D podcast

431
00:22:13,473 --> 00:22:15,713
where a bunch of brothers are dicking around.

432
00:22:16,173 --> 00:22:21,675
And so you're allowed to give them camo cargo shorts

433
00:22:21,995 --> 00:22:24,015
with scale mail underneath them,

434
00:22:24,035 --> 00:22:25,816
because that makes perfect sense.

435
00:22:27,056 --> 00:22:27,916
And then Sirius.

436
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:34,917
Some designs for Abduction on the left, another unannounced project in the middle, and then

437
00:22:34,997 --> 00:22:37,119
Robert Lutece for Bioshock Infinite.

438
00:22:38,160 --> 00:22:39,321
Equally fun to play around with.

439
00:22:40,554 --> 00:22:44,458
And good character designs can kind of exist on any number of these spectrums,

440
00:22:45,099 --> 00:22:48,582
but having a gritty, realistic, serious modern day character

441
00:22:48,622 --> 00:22:51,004
doesn't guarantee it's going to be good or bad.

442
00:22:51,405 --> 00:22:53,266
It's really important to just keep these in mind

443
00:22:53,306 --> 00:22:55,829
because you want your characters to plausibly exist

444
00:22:55,869 --> 00:22:57,971
within the context of this grander universe.

445
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:02,936
You are serving the great master that is the story, the gameplay,

446
00:23:02,956 --> 00:23:03,817
the game as a whole.

447
00:23:07,163 --> 00:23:09,504
So these are sort of my three tenets of character

448
00:23:09,544 --> 00:23:11,826
and costume design, especially costume design.

449
00:23:12,086 --> 00:23:15,848
Kind of just costume design, that's okay.

450
00:23:16,009 --> 00:23:18,570
So I like to break it down as thinking about

451
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:20,912
character, who is wearing the costume,

452
00:23:21,432 --> 00:23:23,273
function, why are they wearing the costume

453
00:23:23,313 --> 00:23:24,734
or what's the purpose of the costume,

454
00:23:25,314 --> 00:23:27,556
and aesthetic, what is the key visual statement

455
00:23:27,676 --> 00:23:28,376
of the costume.

456
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:30,598
So here's a Venn diagram.

457
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:32,479
Oh good, you can see it up there.

458
00:23:32,699 --> 00:23:33,940
I can hardly see it here.

459
00:23:35,357 --> 00:23:40,041
So, function, character, and aesthetic, in varying degrees, need to work together to

460
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:43,464
create a good, compelling costume and character design.

461
00:23:44,184 --> 00:23:47,807
If you just have character and aesthetic, you end up with costumes that don't really

462
00:23:47,847 --> 00:23:51,650
have any plausible function within the context of the story.

463
00:23:52,191 --> 00:23:56,354
If it's just character and function, but it's visually bland, that's just not exciting.

464
00:23:56,774 --> 00:23:57,375
You get the idea.

465
00:23:59,485 --> 00:24:02,089
So character, who is wearing the costume,

466
00:24:02,189 --> 00:24:04,252
what's their personality, social standing,

467
00:24:04,713 --> 00:24:05,995
body type, et cetera.

468
00:24:08,362 --> 00:24:11,703
I think a character's personality, as Richard was saying earlier,

469
00:24:12,003 --> 00:24:14,464
affects a lot about their overall design.

470
00:24:15,144 --> 00:24:18,985
It's going to affect posture, movement, animation, acting,

471
00:24:19,065 --> 00:24:19,785
that sort of thing.

472
00:24:19,845 --> 00:24:22,566
And this is why it becomes immensely important to think about this

473
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:26,567
as you're designing the character and try whenever possible to reflect it

474
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,488
in how you stage your characters, how you place them on the page,

475
00:24:30,508 --> 00:24:32,828
how you present them to art directors, that sort of thing.

476
00:24:33,328 --> 00:24:36,689
I'm getting better at it than I used to be.

477
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:43,513
But really thinking about how these characters would wear this clothing, how fastidious or

478
00:24:43,573 --> 00:24:48,156
sloppy they are, how comfortable or awkward they might be in a given situation or costume

479
00:24:48,196 --> 00:24:52,358
can be a really compelling way to differentiate characters even when they're wearing identical

480
00:24:52,418 --> 00:24:52,758
clothing.

481
00:24:53,374 --> 00:24:55,235
So a character who's comfortable in a uniform

482
00:24:55,475 --> 00:24:57,856
versus someone who's aching to take it off, for example.

483
00:24:59,036 --> 00:25:01,937
So here's the same character from Fable Legends

484
00:25:01,957 --> 00:25:04,138
who's supposed to hulk out at a certain point.

485
00:25:04,638 --> 00:25:08,760
And it's a neat comparison of the same costume,

486
00:25:09,300 --> 00:25:10,560
technically on the same guy,

487
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,681
but on a character with a completely different attitude,

488
00:25:13,742 --> 00:25:15,622
completely different body type,

489
00:25:16,082 --> 00:25:18,183
and how it really shapes the character

490
00:25:18,243 --> 00:25:19,364
and how he comes across.

491
00:25:20,344 --> 00:25:22,445
And if you can see up his skirt.

492
00:25:23,171 --> 00:25:23,751
accidentally.

493
00:25:27,334 --> 00:25:31,636
Function is something I really love to think about.

494
00:25:31,696 --> 00:25:33,778
It's probably my favorite part of costume design,

495
00:25:34,138 --> 00:25:35,419
and it's very fun to research.

496
00:25:36,079 --> 00:25:39,221
But this is really why they're wearing this costume.

497
00:25:39,541 --> 00:25:43,003
What's the cultural societal background within this world?

498
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:44,845
And what's the purpose?

499
00:25:44,925 --> 00:25:45,985
Is it uniform?

500
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:46,946
Is it formal wear?

501
00:25:47,366 --> 00:25:49,007
Is it for mucking about, et cetera?

502
00:25:50,181 --> 00:25:56,288
A function can be broken down into a number of topics, but it's generally just this why,

503
00:25:56,748 --> 00:26:00,172
and why are any of us wearing anything, honestly.

504
00:26:00,593 --> 00:26:05,259
It's important to consider, you don't want someone to be in overly formal wear if it

505
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:09,283
doesn't make sense within the gameplay of the game that you're making.

506
00:26:10,917 --> 00:26:15,039
The one on the left is from Fable Legends, lots of Fable Legends work up here.

507
00:26:15,899 --> 00:26:20,261
And on the right I have some concepts for hosts from Westworld VR.

508
00:26:20,761 --> 00:26:25,283
We had the female host costume already designed for the show itself and we had to design male

509
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:26,243
costumes to match.

510
00:26:26,683 --> 00:26:29,584
And it was really fun to already have the parameters set where it's like, oh, these

511
00:26:29,624 --> 00:26:37,767
are supposed to be hot, sexy dudes wearing very low-cut shirts and then just kind of

512
00:26:37,808 --> 00:26:38,308
go on from there.

513
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:40,924
They serve a very specific purpose.

514
00:26:43,025 --> 00:26:46,146
This was fun, again, for another Cancel Project at Xbox.

515
00:26:46,186 --> 00:26:46,907
There are a lot of those.

516
00:26:47,847 --> 00:26:53,991
You can see in the upper right-hand corner, I have this kind of hood scarf design, and

517
00:26:54,031 --> 00:26:58,673
the idea was that this was a kind of worldwide secret society.

518
00:26:58,693 --> 00:27:00,374
And so coming up with a...

519
00:27:02,626 --> 00:27:04,428
with an item of clothing that they could all wear

520
00:27:04,468 --> 00:27:07,812
in a myriad of different ways to represent the society.

521
00:27:08,713 --> 00:27:11,556
The guy who designed the one on the right

522
00:27:11,597 --> 00:27:12,578
is standing at the back of the room.

523
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:13,138
Hi, Pat.

524
00:27:14,509 --> 00:27:15,950
Okay.

525
00:27:16,070 --> 00:27:17,271
This is for Scalebound,

526
00:27:17,511 --> 00:27:19,492
which was unfortunately also canceled.

527
00:27:19,933 --> 00:27:20,973
Getting tired of saying that.

528
00:27:21,594 --> 00:27:23,715
But it was super fun to play around

529
00:27:23,815 --> 00:27:25,856
with the purpose of this costume,

530
00:27:25,876 --> 00:27:27,737
because the idea is that this guy gets ripped out

531
00:27:27,778 --> 00:27:31,420
of modern day, sent into this medieval-esque fantasy world.

532
00:27:31,920 --> 00:27:34,482
And so this was coming up with costumes

533
00:27:34,522 --> 00:27:36,783
that reflect where he came from,

534
00:27:37,203 --> 00:27:40,646
but also show the slow degradation of his clothing,

535
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:42,407
and also as he starts to...

536
00:27:43,327 --> 00:27:46,550
add-on equipment that he's gotten in the medieval era, that sort of thing.

537
00:27:47,291 --> 00:27:49,473
And he has to let his buff dragon arm out.

538
00:27:52,396 --> 00:27:56,980
And finally, aesthetic. What's the key visual statement of the costumes? This is color blocking,

539
00:27:57,200 --> 00:28:04,787
shape language, visual symbolism, that sort of thing. I have a redraw that I did of Elizabeth's

540
00:28:04,827 --> 00:28:07,009
second costume, which I did not design.

541
00:28:08,179 --> 00:28:13,246
Because I think there are ways that you can still maintain the compelling color blocking of costumes while still

542
00:28:14,088 --> 00:28:17,132
giving it plausible historical form,

543
00:28:17,833 --> 00:28:22,740
thoughtful consideration of what her mother would have actually been wearing given the era, that sort of thing.

544
00:28:25,216 --> 00:28:27,858
I feel like I design Harley Quinns in my free time

545
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:29,240
just because it's very easy,

546
00:28:29,340 --> 00:28:31,342
but she's a fantastic example of a character

547
00:28:31,362 --> 00:28:33,404
who has really compelling aesthetics,

548
00:28:34,085 --> 00:28:36,988
really obvious symbolism, color blocking.

549
00:28:37,048 --> 00:28:40,732
You have the iconography of the Harlequin

550
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:44,276
and the clown motifs, the diamonds,

551
00:28:44,336 --> 00:28:45,517
the red and black party color.

552
00:28:46,398 --> 00:28:47,399
And so you can take that.

553
00:28:48,442 --> 00:28:54,689
shift the time periods around, so whether it's 14th century or 16th century or Victorian

554
00:28:54,789 --> 00:29:00,956
or punk, and you can still tell who that character is because of that compelling aesthetic value

555
00:29:01,016 --> 00:29:02,217
that kind of bursts through.

556
00:29:03,819 --> 00:29:07,343
So again, just looking at that Venn diagram, it's important.

557
00:29:08,164 --> 00:29:09,505
So in other words, do this.

558
00:29:10,672 --> 00:29:13,573
I think Leia's costumes from the original trilogy are fantastic.

559
00:29:13,613 --> 00:29:15,353
They are aesthetically compelling.

560
00:29:15,433 --> 00:29:16,614
They speak to her character.

561
00:29:17,174 --> 00:29:19,655
And they speak to the situation that she is in,

562
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,136
the purpose of the clothing, whether it's utilitarian,

563
00:29:22,616 --> 00:29:27,518
whether she is in, whether she's actually dealing with politics,

564
00:29:27,658 --> 00:29:28,258
things like that.

565
00:29:28,958 --> 00:29:31,519
And don't do this, where someone goes to bed

566
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:35,841
with flimsy strings of pearls on and her hair up.

567
00:29:36,241 --> 00:29:38,522
And you can't pay attention to the movie because it's so bad.

568
00:29:40,205 --> 00:29:45,587
Or alternatively, she's having a chill, like, by-the-fire dinner date with her bae,

569
00:29:46,548 --> 00:29:48,349
and she decides to wear these weird arm corsets.

570
00:29:48,389 --> 00:29:51,950
It's just kind of the worst. So don't do that.

571
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:59,023
And of course, once you actually have to put stuff in the game, as we were just talking

572
00:29:59,043 --> 00:30:04,907
about earlier, you're going to have to accept that eventually gameplay and technical restraints

573
00:30:04,927 --> 00:30:06,368
are going to rain on your parade.

574
00:30:06,848 --> 00:30:11,311
But it's okay, because sometimes those parameters give you interesting inspiration, give you

575
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:12,312
things to play off of.

576
00:30:16,351 --> 00:30:18,833
whatever her name is from Fable Legends,

577
00:30:19,573 --> 00:30:22,175
had this extremely complicated skirt

578
00:30:22,235 --> 00:30:24,276
that was going to be a pain in the butt to rig.

579
00:30:24,776 --> 00:30:26,177
But we eventually figured out ways

580
00:30:26,237 --> 00:30:28,338
where we could swoop them off to the side,

581
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:31,060
group it together so it could be a much simpler rig.

582
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,262
And then with Elizabeth, with young Elizabeth,

583
00:30:34,342 --> 00:30:38,205
we used the damage that sort of shows up

584
00:30:38,345 --> 00:30:41,126
as the game goes on as a way to communicate

585
00:30:41,567 --> 00:30:42,547
progression in the game.

586
00:30:43,328 --> 00:30:48,130
communicate her as a character breaking down and also kind of demarcating where she is going to

587
00:30:48,630 --> 00:30:51,212
have the big transformation where she changes into her second

588
00:30:51,972 --> 00:30:53,233
worse outfit.

589
00:30:56,658 --> 00:31:00,241
I should probably finish this up, so I'm not going to talk a ton about research and reference,

590
00:31:00,481 --> 00:31:00,922
but do it.

591
00:31:01,242 --> 00:31:01,822
It's really important.

592
00:31:01,943 --> 00:31:02,823
We can talk about it later.

593
00:31:03,864 --> 00:31:09,709
And I'll leave you with this great slide of a furry art of mine from high school, and

594
00:31:09,769 --> 00:31:13,712
now what I draw, which looks a lot better because I research and I think about character

595
00:31:13,752 --> 00:31:14,132
design.

596
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,074
So, yeah, do that.

597
00:31:17,014 --> 00:31:17,495
Thanks, guys.

598
00:31:27,129 --> 00:31:31,896
Thank you, Claire. That was lovely and very dense for 12 minutes.

599
00:31:31,916 --> 00:31:34,600
That was awesome. Okay, up next, after this talk,

600
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:38,726
you will not be able to look in the mirror the same way as you do today.

601
00:31:38,806 --> 00:31:41,049
So I would like to introduce Laurel from Blizzard Entertainment.

602
00:31:47,956 --> 00:31:49,757
Hi everybody, my name is Laurel Austin.

603
00:31:49,957 --> 00:31:51,938
I am a principal artist at Blizzard Entertainment

604
00:31:52,338 --> 00:31:54,659
and I'm here to talk about expressive faces

605
00:31:54,839 --> 00:31:56,940
for your characters in concept art and illustration.

606
00:31:57,701 --> 00:32:00,062
At Blizzard, primarily I do marketing art

607
00:32:00,122 --> 00:32:03,643
for games like Hearthstone, Starcraft, Diablo,

608
00:32:03,703 --> 00:32:04,544
World of Warcraft.

609
00:32:06,365 --> 00:32:07,305
And before I came to Blizzard,

610
00:32:07,345 --> 00:32:09,746
I began my career as a concept artist at Splash Damage

611
00:32:09,806 --> 00:32:11,367
where I was the character concept artist

612
00:32:11,607 --> 00:32:13,988
on the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter called Brink.

613
00:32:15,484 --> 00:32:19,605
More recently, I've done a lot of artwork for Blizzard's 2.5D cinematics, including

614
00:32:19,725 --> 00:32:24,867
the series Burdens of Shaohao, and some art from Lords of War and Harbingers.

615
00:32:25,627 --> 00:32:26,868
These are sort of unusual projects.

616
00:32:26,908 --> 00:32:31,449
They're kind of short films that are made up of a series of illustrations, and to these

617
00:32:31,489 --> 00:32:35,531
illustrations our team adds kind of slight animation and parallax.

618
00:32:35,731 --> 00:32:40,573
Not full animation, but somewhere between a motion comic and a full 2D animation.

619
00:32:41,711 --> 00:32:43,812
And I've always loved painting faces,

620
00:32:44,493 --> 00:32:46,254
but it was on these projects in particular

621
00:32:46,334 --> 00:32:47,674
that I really came to understand

622
00:32:47,734 --> 00:32:49,295
how a focus on facial expressions

623
00:32:49,595 --> 00:32:50,916
can really enhance storytelling.

624
00:32:51,817 --> 00:32:53,498
In each of these shorts, you follow a character

625
00:32:53,538 --> 00:32:55,499
through one of the most pivotal moments in their lives.

626
00:32:56,699 --> 00:32:58,140
And it's important to spend a lot of energy

627
00:32:58,200 --> 00:32:59,941
making the character's emotional state really clear.

628
00:33:01,170 --> 00:33:05,413
A well-chosen expression can put your character into their context, tell their story, and

629
00:33:05,453 --> 00:33:06,193
make them seem real.

630
00:33:06,313 --> 00:33:10,816
And in my career as an artist, a well-chosen expression is what I've found to be one of

631
00:33:10,836 --> 00:33:13,137
the most powerful tools I've found to connect with viewers.

632
00:33:14,278 --> 00:33:17,540
And I found that this understanding has changed the way that I approach character art in general.

633
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:22,763
So now whether I'm doing concept art or illustration, I try to imply as much story and character

634
00:33:22,803 --> 00:33:23,844
in the faces as possible.

635
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:24,965
So today...

636
00:33:26,489 --> 00:33:29,452
So today I'm going to share with you a way I found helpful to break down expressions

637
00:33:29,572 --> 00:33:32,355
into their constituent parts so that they can be used as an artistic tool.

638
00:33:33,156 --> 00:33:36,799
Most of us are roughly familiar with how psychologists break down the basic emotions.

639
00:33:37,219 --> 00:33:40,242
There's some disagreement on the particulars of this, but for the purposes of this talk,

640
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:42,224
I'm going to focus on six basic expressions.

641
00:33:43,205 --> 00:33:50,853
This is happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear, and surprise.

642
00:33:51,693 --> 00:33:59,270
Expressions themselves are constellations of many small facial movements, and we should think of these small movements as the building blocks for our characters' performances.

643
00:34:01,377 --> 00:34:05,260
We know a lot of this stuff intuitively, but in real life, it can actually be quite difficult

644
00:34:05,300 --> 00:34:06,922
to see all the elements of an expression.

645
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:13,087
We're so used to reading each other's faces in our daily lives that when we see an expression

646
00:34:13,147 --> 00:34:17,630
on another person's face, we often just directly perceive the emotion that it means to us,

647
00:34:17,771 --> 00:34:20,032
and we don't notice all the little elements that make it up.

648
00:34:20,633 --> 00:34:24,716
Consequently, it can be hard to visualize exactly what an emotion looks like.

649
00:34:25,397 --> 00:34:28,439
If you ask people what happiness looks like, most people would just say a smile.

650
00:34:29,358 --> 00:34:31,679
But as most artists know, there's a lot more to it than that.

651
00:34:32,099 --> 00:34:34,979
So bear with me while I take a few minutes to break down the basic expressions,

652
00:34:35,540 --> 00:34:36,860
and let's look at some of the elements.

653
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:41,781
Here, you have the expected upward movement of the corners of the mouth.

654
00:34:42,322 --> 00:34:44,602
But what people often don't notice is that when that happens,

655
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,483
the nostrils kind of get pulled along with it.

656
00:34:46,563 --> 00:34:50,684
The muscles of the mouth pull aside and pull the nostrils to the side as well.

657
00:34:51,649 --> 00:34:55,992
And the third thing in a smile is really the rays of the lower eyelids.

658
00:34:56,653 --> 00:35:01,757
This is what psychologists call a Duchenne smile, and it's the hallmark of a true and

659
00:35:01,817 --> 00:35:05,420
genuine happy smile, rather than one that's kind of weird or fake.

660
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:10,985
And when we dial up the intensity, all the characteristics just get a bit more extreme.

661
00:35:11,005 --> 00:35:15,268
And you can get new elements added, like a raise to the eyebrows or an opening of the

662
00:35:15,308 --> 00:35:15,488
mouth.

663
00:35:17,152 --> 00:35:19,913
With sadness, most people know the downward movement

664
00:35:19,953 --> 00:35:20,853
of the corners of the mouth,

665
00:35:21,453 --> 00:35:23,254
but one thing people don't often notice about frowns

666
00:35:23,274 --> 00:35:25,155
is that the downward curve is partly created

667
00:35:25,195 --> 00:35:27,355
by an upward movement of the middle of the lower lip.

668
00:35:27,915 --> 00:35:29,276
In addition, the center of the eyebrows

669
00:35:29,336 --> 00:35:30,836
raises up and slightly contracts.

670
00:35:31,936 --> 00:35:33,877
Sadness is also a particularly good example

671
00:35:33,897 --> 00:35:36,558
of how small changes can make a really big difference

672
00:35:36,638 --> 00:35:39,139
in the impression that the face gives.

673
00:35:39,879 --> 00:35:41,639
It doesn't take much to change the impact

674
00:35:41,659 --> 00:35:42,520
of an expression at all.

675
00:35:43,264 --> 00:35:47,047
Here, we barely move the face at all, but by adding more tension to the mouth and brow

676
00:35:47,107 --> 00:35:50,549
and some tears welling up in his eyes, it adds a lot more intensity to the expression.

677
00:35:50,569 --> 00:35:54,772
And one thing the game artists are often called upon to deliver is anger.

678
00:35:55,413 --> 00:35:56,834
Mild anger is relatively simple.

679
00:35:56,974 --> 00:35:58,115
Our guy here looks a bit peeved.

680
00:35:58,823 --> 00:36:03,166
His lips are pursed, his jaw is kind of clenched and thrust forward, his eyebrows go down,

681
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:04,647
and his nostrils move upwards.

682
00:36:05,407 --> 00:36:07,809
And if you intensify anger, some surprising things start to happen.

683
00:36:07,849 --> 00:36:11,932
You get the obvious increase in the upper face tension where you get the lines of the

684
00:36:11,952 --> 00:36:13,613
different muscles smushed against one another.

685
00:36:14,293 --> 00:36:17,075
But in the lower face, I want you to see what happens in the mouth and neck.

686
00:36:17,915 --> 00:36:22,057
The tension in the neck and the lips are deeply intertwined and are mostly caused by a muscle

687
00:36:22,077 --> 00:36:22,838
called the platysma.

688
00:36:22,858 --> 00:36:24,118
It's actually one of my favorite muscles.

689
00:36:24,559 --> 00:36:30,983
And it lies as a sheet in your neck that actually goes from the bottom of your face right over

690
00:36:31,023 --> 00:36:33,884
your clavicles, when it's right at the surface under your skin.

691
00:36:34,585 --> 00:36:39,127
And this is the striated lines that you often see in comic book heroes, when they're really

692
00:36:39,167 --> 00:36:40,928
straining and punching each other in comic books.

693
00:36:43,891 --> 00:36:47,235
So anytime you get a downward movement in the corners of the mouth, this muscle is activated,

694
00:36:47,255 --> 00:36:48,336
and that's when you see those lines.

695
00:36:49,978 --> 00:36:54,983
With disgust, it's good to think about it as your face trying to escape or expel whatever

696
00:36:55,023 --> 00:36:56,224
the disgusting stimulus is.

697
00:36:56,785 --> 00:36:59,447
Here you get the mouth and the nose squishing upwards,

698
00:36:59,807 --> 00:37:01,288
the corners of the mouth moving down,

699
00:37:01,648 --> 00:37:02,709
and you get a squint to the eyes.

700
00:37:02,769 --> 00:37:04,370
The squint to the eyes can include the eyebrows,

701
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:05,310
but it doesn't have to.

702
00:37:06,131 --> 00:37:07,952
With extreme disgust, you again get

703
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:09,192
all the features intensifying,

704
00:37:09,693 --> 00:37:11,274
but you might also get the tongue protruding

705
00:37:11,314 --> 00:37:13,135
as though it's trying to spit out something gross.

706
00:37:14,255 --> 00:37:17,217
With fear, you get a widening of the eyes,

707
00:37:17,237 --> 00:37:18,538
a flare of the nostrils,

708
00:37:19,078 --> 00:37:21,980
an upward movement to the eyebrows, and inwards as well.

709
00:37:22,760 --> 00:37:24,401
And you get a bit of a downward movement

710
00:37:24,421 --> 00:37:25,261
to the corners of the mouth.

711
00:37:26,131 --> 00:37:28,813
And when you intensify fear, all that movement becomes more extreme,

712
00:37:29,153 --> 00:37:31,554
and you might also get an opening of the mouth and nose

713
00:37:32,174 --> 00:37:34,036
in something like a gasp or an intake of breath.

714
00:37:34,636 --> 00:37:36,977
This movement of the nose is actually quite distinct

715
00:37:37,037 --> 00:37:38,538
to the one we talked about on happiness,

716
00:37:38,758 --> 00:37:43,601
because this one actually indicates the muscles in the nose taking in breath.

717
00:37:43,681 --> 00:37:44,402
So it's a bit different.

718
00:37:45,737 --> 00:37:48,279
In surprise, the whole face can appear to stretch vertically.

719
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:52,182
The brow goes straight up, the eyes widen, and the mouth can open.

720
00:37:52,362 --> 00:37:55,804
In this case, even though his jaw is slightly open, his lips are still together.

721
00:37:55,864 --> 00:37:59,646
So you kind of get that surprise face where your lips are still together.

722
00:37:59,666 --> 00:38:05,750
And more extreme surprise, the mouth might open fully and all the elements again become

723
00:38:05,790 --> 00:38:06,451
more exaggerated.

724
00:38:07,174 --> 00:38:08,875
So all of this stuff is pretty simple.

725
00:38:08,915 --> 00:38:10,475
We see people's faces every day.

726
00:38:11,035 --> 00:38:13,096
And we all know that these little constellations

727
00:38:13,316 --> 00:38:15,376
of facial movements can make up these expressions.

728
00:38:15,956 --> 00:38:17,677
But what happens when we start to combine them?

729
00:38:18,017 --> 00:38:19,838
And this is where things really start to get interesting.

730
00:38:20,178 --> 00:38:21,898
We can combine aspects from one expression

731
00:38:21,938 --> 00:38:24,199
to aspects of another, and this is how we create

732
00:38:24,219 --> 00:38:26,119
the most truly interesting and subtle effects.

733
00:38:27,039 --> 00:38:30,780
So if we add aspects of happiness to aspects of surprise,

734
00:38:31,441 --> 00:38:31,941
what do we get?

735
00:38:32,861 --> 00:38:33,401
Free puppies.

736
00:38:35,670 --> 00:38:38,671
Here, his mouth opens and the corners go up,

737
00:38:38,731 --> 00:38:40,132
as you expect from happiness.

738
00:38:40,252 --> 00:38:41,973
His eyebrows raise, as in surprise,

739
00:38:42,353 --> 00:38:45,155
and you get the lower lid raise, indicating that he is indeed

740
00:38:45,215 --> 00:38:46,375
very happy about the puppies.

741
00:38:47,496 --> 00:38:50,897
And then, what happens if we, instead of surprise,

742
00:38:51,058 --> 00:38:51,958
swap out anger?

743
00:38:53,079 --> 00:38:56,740
You get the mouth position is actually identical here.

744
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,921
It is exactly the same.

745
00:38:59,302 --> 00:39:01,163
But his eyebrows contracting make a face

746
00:39:01,183 --> 00:39:02,463
that's due to a very different story.

747
00:39:03,472 --> 00:39:05,513
a story that may or may not have happened to me in high school.

748
00:39:07,354 --> 00:39:10,595
You can even combine the same two expressions in different ways for different effects.

749
00:39:11,555 --> 00:39:15,696
And if we dial back the intensity, you get, adding slight anger to slight happiness, you

750
00:39:15,736 --> 00:39:17,077
get the ever-useful smolder.

751
00:39:18,297 --> 00:39:21,659
This expression is found on box art a lot and occasionally on actual humans.

752
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:27,080
Here you get the eyebrows contracting a little bit, a bit of the lower lid raised, and a

753
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:28,201
slight upturn to the mouth.

754
00:39:29,261 --> 00:39:32,102
And sometimes we have a very specific story moment we have to work to.

755
00:39:33,117 --> 00:39:34,443
In this case, surprise and fear.

756
00:39:34,885 --> 00:39:37,496
Let's say your kid backing your car into a mailbox.

757
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:44,026
Here the mouth opens, the eyes widen, the eyebrows contract as in fear, and the eyebrows

758
00:39:44,086 --> 00:39:44,606
raise more.

759
00:39:44,987 --> 00:39:47,868
Fear is a phrase that actually have a lot, or are actually quite similar expressions

760
00:39:47,928 --> 00:39:49,009
and share a lot of elements.

761
00:39:49,109 --> 00:39:53,872
You have to identify which parts are sort of iconic to each particular expression.

762
00:39:53,932 --> 00:39:57,494
In this case, the eyebrow contraction is very important to indicate fear.

763
00:39:58,334 --> 00:40:01,996
But what if our story changes and we have to add elements of a third expression?

764
00:40:02,577 --> 00:40:03,657
Something like disgust.

765
00:40:04,758 --> 00:40:07,460
Here it might suit a story a bit more like this.

766
00:40:08,998 --> 00:40:11,718
So again, you have an unchanged eye movement.

767
00:40:13,199 --> 00:40:14,539
You have an unchanged eye movement,

768
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,500
because disgust really doesn't come into the eyes a whole lot.

769
00:40:17,900 --> 00:40:20,220
But you get the nose wrinkling, the corners of the mouth

770
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:21,641
pulling down, and the lips protruding.

771
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:24,621
But you still have the open mouth, like in Fear

772
00:40:24,661 --> 00:40:25,182
and Surprise.

773
00:40:26,242 --> 00:40:29,162
You can even combine diametrically opposed emotions

774
00:40:29,703 --> 00:40:30,663
to really nice effect.

775
00:40:31,083 --> 00:40:32,363
And it's worth experimenting to see

776
00:40:32,403 --> 00:40:33,383
what sorts of impressions you can

777
00:40:33,423 --> 00:40:36,204
get by adding bits of expressions to one another.

778
00:40:37,885 --> 00:40:40,466
So how do we improve at making expressive faces?

779
00:40:41,866 --> 00:40:42,727
Keep a mirror around.

780
00:40:43,007 --> 00:40:44,827
Pay close attention to the way your own face looks

781
00:40:45,368 --> 00:40:46,588
as you study the basic expressions

782
00:40:46,628 --> 00:40:47,828
and use it to help you try things out.

783
00:40:48,169 --> 00:40:50,790
Justin can attest that I do have a mirror at my desk

784
00:40:50,810 --> 00:40:51,670
for this exact purpose.

785
00:40:53,230 --> 00:40:54,051
Study the anatomy.

786
00:40:54,431 --> 00:40:55,751
There are dozens of muscles in the face.

787
00:40:55,811 --> 00:40:57,332
And while you don't need to know all of them,

788
00:40:57,532 --> 00:40:59,073
knowing the major groups of them will really

789
00:40:59,113 --> 00:41:01,333
help you understand what bits affect one another

790
00:41:01,634 --> 00:41:02,934
and how it all comes together.

791
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:10,283
Mixing and matching bits of basic expressions is a way I've found helpful to help me understand

792
00:41:10,323 --> 00:41:11,344
more complex expressions.

793
00:41:11,464 --> 00:41:14,346
What I've shown you here is just the tiniest sliver of what you can do.

794
00:41:14,427 --> 00:41:17,889
It's almost like paint in the end, where you can just take little bits of one and add them

795
00:41:17,929 --> 00:41:22,553
to a lot of another, and you get infinite possibilities.

796
00:41:23,013 --> 00:41:26,596
Things like insanity, egotism, impatience, they all just get a bit more flavor if we

797
00:41:26,616 --> 00:41:28,098
can throw in things that are unexpected.

798
00:41:28,778 --> 00:41:32,601
So using this approach to facial expressions has helped me add more layers to my character

799
00:41:32,681 --> 00:41:34,363
art, and I hope you found it helpful too.

800
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,031
Thank you Laurel.

801
00:41:44,331 --> 00:41:46,292
That was awesome, very eye-opening, very cool.

802
00:41:46,852 --> 00:41:48,453
And last but definitely not least,

803
00:41:48,493 --> 00:41:50,934
we have Simon from Deep Pad Studios.

804
00:41:58,577 --> 00:41:58,838
Hello.

805
00:42:00,158 --> 00:42:01,519
So I'm Simon S. Anderson.

806
00:42:01,719 --> 00:42:04,000
I'm the art director for a game called Owl Boy

807
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,901
and a studio called Deep Pad Studio.

808
00:42:07,598 --> 00:42:10,380
It was a pixel platformer with an emphasis on flying mechanics.

809
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:13,541
So, if you're expecting a 3D talk,

810
00:42:13,561 --> 00:42:15,522
then unfortunately you're in the wrong place.

811
00:42:17,283 --> 00:42:18,504
Has anyone actually played it here?

812
00:42:19,685 --> 00:42:21,426
Yes! There are people. It exists.

813
00:42:22,386 --> 00:42:25,448
Alright, so, what I'm going to be talking about

814
00:42:25,528 --> 00:42:28,509
is finding the purpose and final touches to your character designs.

815
00:42:28,549 --> 00:42:31,651
Because a lot of times you have kind of what you want, but not quite.

816
00:42:33,368 --> 00:42:35,850
I'm not going to dictate exactly how you're going to do this,

817
00:42:35,910 --> 00:42:38,833
so just think of it as a thing that you can add to your toolbox

818
00:42:39,273 --> 00:42:40,454
and then discard all the rest of it.

819
00:42:40,474 --> 00:42:42,436
Okay, everyone on board?

820
00:42:42,456 --> 00:42:43,497
Okay.

821
00:42:44,898 --> 00:42:45,058
So...

822
00:42:47,380 --> 00:42:48,561
AKA long title, yeah, yeah, yeah.

823
00:42:49,302 --> 00:42:51,203
This is the game I made. It's very pretty.

824
00:42:53,646 --> 00:42:55,267
And these are all the characters that I did.

825
00:42:56,388 --> 00:42:57,149
They're also very pretty.

826
00:42:58,510 --> 00:42:59,411
Okay, so...

827
00:43:00,391 --> 00:43:02,693
First off, what is the purpose of your design?

828
00:43:03,154 --> 00:43:06,176
So, context and purpose are gonna be integral

829
00:43:06,216 --> 00:43:07,958
to what your design needs to look like.

830
00:43:08,378 --> 00:43:11,021
So, what audiences is it made for?

831
00:43:11,401 --> 00:43:12,823
What is its function within your game?

832
00:43:13,703 --> 00:43:15,445
How does the design blend with the universe

833
00:43:15,465 --> 00:43:16,266
that you've already made?

834
00:43:17,447 --> 00:43:21,310
And second, what do you do when you have,

835
00:43:21,891 --> 00:43:23,312
when you know the goal of your design,

836
00:43:23,733 --> 00:43:24,694
but it kind of feels off?

837
00:43:26,044 --> 00:43:30,045
So most of you are familiar with concepts

838
00:43:30,325 --> 00:43:33,086
like strong silhouettes, color theory,

839
00:43:33,246 --> 00:43:35,226
abstract shapes, and main character traits,

840
00:43:35,726 --> 00:43:39,407
mostly because these guys already told you about it.

841
00:43:40,287 --> 00:43:41,667
But sometimes you have those things

842
00:43:41,828 --> 00:43:43,728
and your design still doesn't quite work.

843
00:43:44,228 --> 00:43:46,909
So let's start up with design purpose.

844
00:43:47,469 --> 00:43:50,009
I'll start up with some examples on how perspective

845
00:43:50,089 --> 00:43:52,730
can guide your design to become more interesting.

846
00:43:53,190 --> 00:43:53,950
And I'll do that by

847
00:43:56,105 --> 00:43:58,187
bringing up a game that I did not design,

848
00:43:59,227 --> 00:44:01,229
which would be these ones.

849
00:44:02,270 --> 00:44:05,812
Here we have Diminished Cap, we have Seiken Adetsu,

850
00:44:05,852 --> 00:44:06,873
we have Breath of Fire.

851
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:08,554
All of these are top-down games,

852
00:44:08,594 --> 00:44:10,736
which you look for a specific direction,

853
00:44:11,716 --> 00:44:16,400
and they are, I have handwritten notes, it's great.

854
00:44:18,714 --> 00:44:21,355
So certain projects will require you

855
00:44:21,695 --> 00:44:23,016
to view your game from a certain angle.

856
00:44:23,276 --> 00:44:25,856
So this is especially true for 2D art and pixel art,

857
00:44:25,876 --> 00:44:26,717
but sometimes 3D.

858
00:44:27,737 --> 00:44:29,978
And usually you're stuck with the perspective you choose

859
00:44:30,018 --> 00:44:31,218
for the majority of the project.

860
00:44:31,278 --> 00:44:33,399
So you want to reuse your assets as much as possible.

861
00:44:34,179 --> 00:44:35,680
And as such, the perspective you pick

862
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:37,520
is really important to your character design.

863
00:44:39,381 --> 00:44:41,042
Often these days you make these decisions,

864
00:44:41,122 --> 00:44:43,882
take these decisions for granted, just as how things are.

865
00:44:44,583 --> 00:44:47,304
But let's look at Link, for example.

866
00:44:49,899 --> 00:44:51,220
So if you look at his design,

867
00:44:51,980 --> 00:44:54,100
there's a lot of emphasis on the hair and the hat

868
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:56,361
because that's what you want to see

869
00:44:56,401 --> 00:44:57,481
from a top-down perspective.

870
00:44:57,782 --> 00:44:58,942
For example, if you look at here,

871
00:45:00,062 --> 00:45:01,663
this is a very different illustration

872
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:03,563
than what you see in the instruction manuals.

873
00:45:05,444 --> 00:45:07,465
Emphasis on the hair, very important

874
00:45:07,505 --> 00:45:08,485
because that's all you're gonna see.

875
00:45:08,505 --> 00:45:09,985
You're not gonna see much of the torso.

876
00:45:10,526 --> 00:45:13,086
So from a character design perspective,

877
00:45:13,166 --> 00:45:14,647
he might seem fairly plain.

878
00:45:16,690 --> 00:45:19,432
This is a character clearly designed for low resolutions

879
00:45:19,632 --> 00:45:24,074
when you did not have a lot of memory for your consoles.

880
00:45:24,874 --> 00:45:27,795
However, if you compare the design to the more recent ones,

881
00:45:29,356 --> 00:45:30,776
you can kind of see how it's changed.

882
00:45:30,796 --> 00:45:32,917
There's a lot more emphasis on the mid-body

883
00:45:34,538 --> 00:45:35,559
and what you carry.

884
00:45:35,579 --> 00:45:36,199
I mean,

885
00:45:38,167 --> 00:45:40,228
You can see that the shield is carrying on the back,

886
00:45:40,329 --> 00:45:42,270
and you have that nice big belt going there,

887
00:45:42,330 --> 00:45:44,412
but it does actually serve a purpose.

888
00:45:45,032 --> 00:45:46,453
It shows that the center of mass

889
00:45:46,694 --> 00:45:48,215
is in the center of the character.

890
00:45:48,815 --> 00:45:52,038
It's not just some sort of casual trait that you do.

891
00:45:52,939 --> 00:45:55,461
And I would say, it's not a surprise

892
00:45:55,521 --> 00:45:56,942
that the later Zelda games

893
00:45:57,882 --> 00:45:59,504
have been using the Wind Waker design.

894
00:46:00,144 --> 00:46:01,746
Again, an emphasis on the hair,

895
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:03,147
you still have the hat on it,

896
00:46:04,488 --> 00:46:05,148
and there's a...

897
00:46:05,822 --> 00:46:08,924
there's a lot less emphasis on the lower half of the body.

898
00:46:09,824 --> 00:46:11,405
So, all of this is done in sections.

899
00:46:12,846 --> 00:46:14,808
And I also want to take a footnote.

900
00:46:16,209 --> 00:46:18,050
Take a moment to consider whether or not

901
00:46:18,410 --> 00:46:20,031
you picked certain shapes for your character

902
00:46:20,952 --> 00:46:22,373
as if it was supposed to be that way

903
00:46:22,633 --> 00:46:24,034
or because it actually serves a function.

904
00:46:25,475 --> 00:46:26,115
Okay, so.

905
00:46:28,837 --> 00:46:30,398
Some rules of thumb for design theory.

906
00:46:31,270 --> 00:46:33,991
Now, there's some simple rules I want to bring attention to.

907
00:46:34,431 --> 00:46:36,371
Again, you're probably familiar with practices

908
00:46:36,431 --> 00:46:38,212
like outlines and body shapes and all of that.

909
00:46:38,932 --> 00:46:40,332
So I want to bring attention to two of them.

910
00:46:41,912 --> 00:46:44,053
Repeated color blocks and consistent patterns.

911
00:46:45,533 --> 00:46:47,534
Now, finding color blocks is really simple

912
00:46:47,834 --> 00:46:49,294
and is a good rule of thumb for any design.

913
00:46:49,714 --> 00:46:52,535
So the gist is that you pick a certain set of colors

914
00:46:52,555 --> 00:46:54,375
for your character and make sure they're repeated

915
00:46:54,395 --> 00:46:55,735
throughout the design pleasingly.

916
00:46:56,795 --> 00:46:59,356
I think Street Fighter is a pretty good example of that.

917
00:47:00,669 --> 00:47:02,389
Notice that most of the characters here,

918
00:47:02,750 --> 00:47:04,870
the colors are repeated more than once,

919
00:47:05,190 --> 00:47:06,750
and usually takes up a large space.

920
00:47:07,510 --> 00:47:10,131
So picking too many colors can feel busy and inconsistent.

921
00:47:10,411 --> 00:47:12,211
Of course, it depends on what kind of project you're doing.

922
00:47:15,872 --> 00:47:16,932
Lost my train of thought here.

923
00:47:19,253 --> 00:47:22,633
If something feels off, or it feels inconsistent,

924
00:47:22,993 --> 00:47:25,234
do a quick color check to see if any of the colors

925
00:47:25,314 --> 00:47:27,714
are actually repeated, or you're adding redundant color.

926
00:47:28,474 --> 00:47:29,915
Or, for that matter, if they're too similar.

927
00:47:30,925 --> 00:47:33,605
You can also break the rules by adding a focus color.

928
00:47:34,025 --> 00:47:36,326
Now, your color choices can be nice and spread out,

929
00:47:36,526 --> 00:47:39,166
but having a single dominant color without repetition

930
00:47:39,186 --> 00:47:40,447
can be surprisingly satisfying.

931
00:47:42,347 --> 00:47:45,087
Next, we have consistent patterns.

932
00:47:47,388 --> 00:47:48,868
I think this is the wrong slide, actually.

933
00:47:49,848 --> 00:47:51,969
Ah, well, never mind.

934
00:47:52,829 --> 00:47:55,269
Often you add minor details to our designs,

935
00:47:55,409 --> 00:47:57,430
and we forget that a particular shape or line

936
00:47:57,470 --> 00:47:59,050
is more pleasing if it repeats itself

937
00:47:59,090 --> 00:47:59,750
throughout the character.

938
00:48:00,442 --> 00:48:01,884
If there are a number of defining shapes,

939
00:48:02,285 --> 00:48:03,787
then you'll start feeling that something is off.

940
00:48:04,728 --> 00:48:07,091
So, I'll be using my own main character

941
00:48:07,191 --> 00:48:08,353
as a good example for this.

942
00:48:08,633 --> 00:48:11,117
So, this is Otis, he's the main character of my game,

943
00:48:11,337 --> 00:48:13,981
very nice, and when I say nice,

944
00:48:14,121 --> 00:48:16,164
it is a sketch from roughly 10 years ago.

945
00:48:17,289 --> 00:48:19,011
and he does look terrible.

946
00:48:19,831 --> 00:48:21,933
He's got some basic ideas here,

947
00:48:22,193 --> 00:48:23,874
but just to point them out,

948
00:48:24,374 --> 00:48:26,616
you can see that he has some barely visible eyebrows,

949
00:48:26,676 --> 00:48:29,958
he has some sort of sideburn kind of thing,

950
00:48:30,418 --> 00:48:32,420
he has like a checkerboard thing on his neck,

951
00:48:33,260 --> 00:48:35,742
just plain hands, and the only repeatable pattern

952
00:48:35,762 --> 00:48:38,204
that I can kind of see is the black around his neck

953
00:48:38,344 --> 00:48:40,065
and the little line around his feet.

954
00:48:40,926 --> 00:48:42,086
So, let's jump forward.

955
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,128
This is his final design.

956
00:48:45,729 --> 00:48:45,929
Now.

957
00:48:47,007 --> 00:48:50,608
In the final version, the differences might appear subtle,

958
00:48:51,068 --> 00:48:52,008
but I'll point them out.

959
00:48:52,769 --> 00:48:55,249
So for the shapes, there are pointed tips

960
00:48:55,369 --> 00:48:56,350
all throughout his design.

961
00:48:56,570 --> 00:48:59,031
So if you look at the hair, the sideburns,

962
00:48:59,091 --> 00:49:00,671
the eyebrows, and the tips of his shoes,

963
00:49:00,851 --> 00:49:02,012
all of those are points.

964
00:49:03,692 --> 00:49:05,473
Also, his neck fluff, incidentally,

965
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:06,973
mirrors the shape of his shoes.

966
00:49:07,153 --> 00:49:08,194
Now you have consistency.

967
00:49:09,494 --> 00:49:11,035
I've also employed color blocking,

968
00:49:12,015 --> 00:49:13,075
which you can see here.

969
00:49:16,902 --> 00:49:19,163
Shoes and cloak, no wait, yeah.

970
00:49:19,223 --> 00:49:21,144
Shoes, cloak and hair share the same colors

971
00:49:21,504 --> 00:49:22,865
as do his sweater and eyebrows,

972
00:49:23,806 --> 00:49:26,007
as well as his sweater edges and neck fluff,

973
00:49:26,547 --> 00:49:29,249
and his skin and his pants are purposely made to be similar

974
00:49:30,089 --> 00:49:31,330
to make his face stand out less.

975
00:49:32,657 --> 00:49:36,958
So the only element here that stands out are his gloves,

976
00:49:37,498 --> 00:49:39,418
because they are the main element of the game.

977
00:49:39,458 --> 00:49:41,179
If you played Owlboy, you know that you do a lot

978
00:49:41,219 --> 00:49:42,039
of carrying in the game,

979
00:49:42,059 --> 00:49:43,619
so you want to see his gloves at all times.

980
00:49:44,100 --> 00:49:47,300
But just to make sure that it fits the whole theme of it,

981
00:49:47,661 --> 00:49:50,541
I've added two little dangly relic things

982
00:49:50,581 --> 00:49:53,102
that show up when you run, so it doesn't feel too intense.

983
00:49:55,843 --> 00:49:56,123
However.

984
00:49:57,173 --> 00:50:00,094
I would make an argument that sometimes

985
00:50:01,854 --> 00:50:03,395
when you make these main shapes,

986
00:50:04,155 --> 00:50:06,376
it's usually difficult to find them

987
00:50:06,416 --> 00:50:08,396
when you're doing it in a big resolution,

988
00:50:08,456 --> 00:50:10,037
especially when you're doing small sprites.

989
00:50:10,937 --> 00:50:14,198
So oftentimes, I will actually design a character

990
00:50:14,378 --> 00:50:15,158
in pixel art.

991
00:50:15,799 --> 00:50:19,840
This was the in-between before I did the finalized design.

992
00:50:23,257 --> 00:50:23,537
There it is.

993
00:50:24,598 --> 00:50:27,800
So this is what he looked like between the two

994
00:50:28,280 --> 00:50:28,961
different designs.

995
00:50:29,721 --> 00:50:31,762
By translating the original sketch to pixel art,

996
00:50:32,243 --> 00:50:34,404
I had to choose the element which stood out the most.

997
00:50:34,684 --> 00:50:36,865
So his color placement, his big neck,

998
00:50:36,965 --> 00:50:38,466
emphasis on the sideburns, eyebrows,

999
00:50:38,506 --> 00:50:40,147
and all that came from the small scale.

1000
00:50:40,688 --> 00:50:43,129
You can kinda see how that moved along.

1001
00:50:45,678 --> 00:50:50,102
So, also, just a little side thing.

1002
00:50:50,442 --> 00:50:53,445
If you're looking at your design and you're thinking,

1003
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:57,709
these things are nice, but I can't quite tell

1004
00:50:58,169 --> 00:50:59,470
if they're fitting the theme of it,

1005
00:50:59,790 --> 00:51:01,072
try to remove them instead.

1006
00:51:02,853 --> 00:51:05,956
Take away every single part and see what feels weird.

1007
00:51:06,176 --> 00:51:07,818
Then put them back and emphasize.

1008
00:51:10,240 --> 00:51:11,441
All right, so next up.

1009
00:51:12,546 --> 00:51:15,551
how to do abstract design principle on realistic characters.

1010
00:51:20,987 --> 00:51:24,930
So it's a very common issue that the design of one thing

1011
00:51:24,990 --> 00:51:26,511
doesn't marry the feel of the style

1012
00:51:26,552 --> 00:51:27,793
of something else in the world.

1013
00:51:29,274 --> 00:51:32,256
This is also something, this is also one of the reasons

1014
00:51:32,296 --> 00:51:36,780
why Pixlr traditionally has been so easy to iterate on.

1015
00:51:38,102 --> 00:51:40,103
For example, when you rotate a pixel,

1016
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:42,565
you kind of break the consistency.

1017
00:51:42,665 --> 00:51:44,607
Consistency is the most important thing

1018
00:51:44,667 --> 00:51:46,969
when you're doing character design

1019
00:51:47,029 --> 00:51:48,911
and when you're trying to make things fit into the world.

1020
00:51:50,214 --> 00:51:53,256
but this also applies to realistic characters.

1021
00:51:53,996 --> 00:51:57,879
So I'm going to use the example of how Marvel

1022
00:51:57,919 --> 00:52:00,681
translated their characters from movies,

1023
00:52:01,101 --> 00:52:03,142
no, from comic books into movies,

1024
00:52:04,463 --> 00:52:06,325
and to show you how they did that.

1025
00:52:06,925 --> 00:52:12,569
So on the surface, it's sort of the standard idea

1026
00:52:12,629 --> 00:52:14,690
that, well, they kind of grayed them out

1027
00:52:14,890 --> 00:52:16,531
and gave them more detailed suits

1028
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:17,532
and that's the way they fit in.

1029
00:52:18,390 --> 00:52:26,019
But I want to make the argument that it's very subtle things drawn in from the world

1030
00:52:26,059 --> 00:52:27,220
that makes these things fit.

1031
00:52:28,461 --> 00:52:32,526
To use Captain America as an example, here you see the movie version.

1032
00:52:33,467 --> 00:52:38,152
One of the things they've done here is that they've incorporated subtle design cues from

1033
00:52:38,192 --> 00:52:40,535
the military personnel that he's actually hanging out with.

1034
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,556
You can see that on his belts. You can see that on his helmet

1035
00:52:45,276 --> 00:52:51,020
It's still the same character, but because it shares those consistent design traits, and that's why he fits in

1036
00:52:52,541 --> 00:52:59,806
If you instead had taken the design from let's say the comic books where he has sort of his fish scale armor thing

1037
00:53:00,626 --> 00:53:06,890
There's nothing that draws parallels between the area that he's in and the area that he is supposed to represent

1038
00:53:07,879 --> 00:53:10,120
And you can practically do this with everything.

1039
00:53:10,360 --> 00:53:14,303
If your movie is looking like a giant neon landscape,

1040
00:53:14,903 --> 00:53:17,804
you want your characters to look like that neon landscape.

1041
00:53:18,105 --> 00:53:20,086
If your characters are dark and gritty,

1042
00:53:20,546 --> 00:53:22,087
you want them to reflect that.

1043
00:53:22,867 --> 00:53:25,428
So draw in things from the rest of your world,

1044
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:28,350
and your characters will feel more alive.

1045
00:53:28,650 --> 00:53:30,971
So just a final thought,

1046
00:53:31,692 --> 00:53:33,993
because we don't really have that much time.

1047
00:53:36,174 --> 00:53:37,215
I've rambled a lot about.

1048
00:53:37,584 --> 00:53:40,365
different design principles, and maybe not all of it made sense,

1049
00:53:40,925 --> 00:53:44,868
but I would urge every one of you to break every single thing that I said,

1050
00:53:45,628 --> 00:53:48,069
because I'm just some guy, and I have random opinions.

1051
00:53:49,750 --> 00:53:51,811
And I'm pretty sure that most of you will figure out

1052
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,233
a lot more interesting ways to design characters

1053
00:53:54,253 --> 00:53:56,014
than I can talk on stage in 10 minutes.

1054
00:53:56,554 --> 00:53:57,675
So, thank you for your time.

1055
00:54:06,585 --> 00:54:08,046
Awesome, thank you guys very much.

1056
00:54:08,086 --> 00:54:09,427
I wanna just do one more round of applause

1057
00:54:09,447 --> 00:54:11,028
for the panelists up here to participate in this.

1058
00:54:11,048 --> 00:54:11,689
Thank you.

1059
00:54:11,729 --> 00:54:13,249
Thank you.

1060
00:54:13,269 --> 00:54:13,470
Thank you.

1061
00:54:13,490 --> 00:54:14,630
Thank you.

1062
00:54:14,710 --> 00:54:15,851
Thank you.

1063
00:54:15,891 --> 00:54:16,451
Thank you.

1064
00:54:16,572 --> 00:54:17,432
Thank you.

1065
00:54:17,472 --> 00:54:18,092
Thank you.

1066
00:54:18,112 --> 00:54:19,593
I appreciate it very much.

1067
00:54:19,613 --> 00:54:21,094
This is kind of just an experiment

1068
00:54:21,455 --> 00:54:24,416
to see how we can evolve the art talks

1069
00:54:24,436 --> 00:54:26,217
and the art presentations at GDC.

1070
00:54:26,258 --> 00:54:28,759
So again, fill out your surveys.

1071
00:54:28,779 --> 00:54:29,540
Let us know what you think,

1072
00:54:29,760 --> 00:54:31,481
and we'll continue to iterate on this format.

1073
00:54:33,085 --> 00:54:34,926
And I believe we have some time for some questions,

1074
00:54:34,966 --> 00:54:36,227
so there's some mics here on the side.

1075
00:54:36,267 --> 00:54:37,967
If anyone has any questions for any of the panelists,

1076
00:54:38,988 --> 00:54:40,429
go ahead and ask away.

1077
00:54:46,752 --> 00:54:49,233
Hi, my question is for Richard.

1078
00:54:51,374 --> 00:54:58,498
When you are designing those little vignettes,

1079
00:55:00,059 --> 00:55:02,584
Are you just putting one of your favorite designs in them

1080
00:55:02,904 --> 00:55:04,868
and then presenting them to the rest of your team?

1081
00:55:04,888 --> 00:55:07,392
That was for you, sorry.

1082
00:55:09,985 --> 00:55:13,787
Basically what I was trying to get at, maybe I didn't explain it very well, but once you've

1083
00:55:13,807 --> 00:55:17,068
got those scenes set up, it's very easy to swap out your costumes.

1084
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:23,951
For the most part, our casting and our costume comes in two different waves for us at Naughty

1085
00:55:23,971 --> 00:55:24,211
Dog.

1086
00:55:25,651 --> 00:55:33,094
So costume-wise, once we know what that person's going to look like, ethnicity, age, all kinds

1087
00:55:33,134 --> 00:55:37,116
of other things we take into account, it's mainly just going to be costume at that point.

1088
00:55:37,832 --> 00:55:39,172
So once you've got that scene set up,

1089
00:55:40,413 --> 00:55:42,374
what I like to do is I swap out all my costumes

1090
00:55:42,394 --> 00:55:43,895
and I test them in that environment.

1091
00:55:45,056 --> 00:55:48,097
So again, you have multiple pieces of the puzzle in play.

1092
00:55:49,078 --> 00:55:50,199
There's a narrative in there,

1093
00:55:51,039 --> 00:55:52,760
and you're testing that costume against that.

1094
00:55:53,541 --> 00:55:55,802
So for instance, stereotypes and tropes,

1095
00:55:55,842 --> 00:55:58,063
in a lot of cases when I started doing this process,

1096
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:02,446
instantly it was too heavy handed.

1097
00:56:02,466 --> 00:56:03,366
Do you know what I mean?

1098
00:56:03,466 --> 00:56:04,927
You're beating the audience over the head,

1099
00:56:05,147 --> 00:56:07,408
going, this guy's a villain, or this guy, you know.

1100
00:56:08,072 --> 00:56:11,495
So you find out that subtlety is where you want to be.

1101
00:56:11,515 --> 00:56:15,219
You want to, as I think a few of us said, you want to support the narrative and support

1102
00:56:15,259 --> 00:56:15,800
the design.

1103
00:56:16,401 --> 00:56:18,723
You don't want to be distracting people from that.

1104
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:27,903
Yeah, maybe just to clarify, my question was sort of about getting buy-in from the team.

1105
00:56:27,943 --> 00:56:32,405
You mentioned how they, at first, they didn't like the glasses on your bruiser character,

1106
00:56:32,445 --> 00:56:34,106
but then they did.

1107
00:56:34,246 --> 00:56:40,109
Was that because you presented all of those with the designs that you wanted?

1108
00:56:40,129 --> 00:56:40,989
I did.

1109
00:56:41,089 --> 00:56:45,631
So in that presentation that I did, I first showed a lineup of characters.

1110
00:56:46,425 --> 00:56:49,847
realized that people were making decisions based on too little information.

1111
00:56:50,348 --> 00:56:54,210
Then I set up a scene with this chap who's looking all, you know,

1112
00:56:54,390 --> 00:56:56,731
empowered by the framing and the setup of the shot,

1113
00:56:57,172 --> 00:56:59,553
and then I repeated all those costumes within that.

1114
00:57:01,354 --> 00:57:04,996
And I was confident that the glasses were going to sell, and I thought that it

1115
00:57:05,036 --> 00:57:07,918
was a better way of presenting it. And they did. Everyone came back the

1116
00:57:07,958 --> 00:57:11,040
next day and was like, yeah, we're thinking the glasses are pretty cool now.

1117
00:57:11,640 --> 00:57:14,742
They were like, okay, cool. Yeah. Does that make sense?

1118
00:57:15,222 --> 00:57:15,423
Thank you.

1119
00:57:16,997 --> 00:57:18,258
All right.

1120
00:57:18,278 --> 00:57:20,860
As a writer, can you guys describe what you would like

1121
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:24,002
to see when a writer pitches a character overview, some

1122
00:57:24,022 --> 00:57:24,883
specific elements?

1123
00:57:27,927 --> 00:57:31,971
I can at least speak from the perspective of my current team I'm working with.

1124
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:37,297
Sean Vanaman, who's the writer at Campo Santo and one of the founders of Campo,

1125
00:57:37,917 --> 00:57:42,943
will often be figuring out characters by writing out these small dialogue vignettes,

1126
00:57:43,523 --> 00:57:46,406
and it has been immensely helpful for me to be able to...

1127
00:57:47,807 --> 00:57:49,848
more so than just writing down on paper saying,

1128
00:57:49,868 --> 00:57:52,089
like, oh, they're quirky or they're sassy.

1129
00:57:52,550 --> 00:57:55,151
Seeing them in context and interacting with each other

1130
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,891
gives me so much to play around with.

1131
00:57:57,452 --> 00:57:59,773
And so it already helps me in the same way

1132
00:57:59,833 --> 00:58:02,834
that by showing them actually in a scene,

1133
00:58:03,274 --> 00:58:05,275
that also gives me something to build off of

1134
00:58:05,415 --> 00:58:06,936
and it has been immensely helpful.

1135
00:58:07,036 --> 00:58:09,537
So anytime I can actually get dialogue

1136
00:58:09,597 --> 00:58:12,238
or kind of a vertical slice of what a scene might be like,

1137
00:58:12,398 --> 00:58:15,460
even if it's completely scrapped later in production,

1138
00:58:15,540 --> 00:58:17,000
I've found that to be very helpful.

1139
00:58:18,077 --> 00:58:25,065
I also found that if you are clear about how you want the viewers to feel about the character,

1140
00:58:26,346 --> 00:58:29,990
like if you want them to be vulnerable or if you want them to feel powerful or anything

1141
00:58:30,111 --> 00:58:34,055
like that, that's important stuff for visual artists to know.

1142
00:58:40,365 --> 00:58:40,606
Hi.

1143
00:58:41,388 --> 00:58:44,294
So for Claire, you had that whole section on reference,

1144
00:58:44,775 --> 00:58:47,000
and you had to rush through it, and I was wondering, with a

1145
00:58:47,040 --> 00:58:50,207
bit more time, if you or anybody had more to say about

1146
00:58:50,247 --> 00:58:51,249
that stuff, because that seemed cool.

1147
00:58:52,940 --> 00:58:56,543
Yeah, reference is super important and very important to my process.

1148
00:58:57,123 --> 00:59:02,827
I wholly recommend when you're working on a character, get your raw ideas unadulterated

1149
00:59:02,867 --> 00:59:04,088
by reference down on paper.

1150
00:59:04,989 --> 00:59:09,912
Start researching, start doing studies from that research to really internalize the reference

1151
00:59:09,972 --> 00:59:10,213
because

1152
00:59:10,673 --> 00:59:15,457
You start to build up this muscle memory and you build an internal library in your brain to draw from,

1153
00:59:15,557 --> 00:59:18,800
which is way better than just scrolling constantly through your Pinterest pages.

1154
00:59:20,221 --> 00:59:23,704
And then you integrate the reference, and then once you get to that point,

1155
00:59:23,744 --> 00:59:28,408
you have to kind of put your foot down and also decide when you break from that reference,

1156
00:59:28,568 --> 00:59:29,409
because it's meant to be...

1157
00:59:29,889 --> 00:59:33,490
guidelines to guide your design in the right direction,

1158
00:59:33,870 --> 00:59:38,371
but again, you're making a game, you're making it in the context of other characters and story.

1159
00:59:38,971 --> 00:59:42,192
And so being able to decide what you're drawing from,

1160
00:59:43,232 --> 00:59:45,193
how you're going to integrate it, is super important.

1161
00:59:46,113 --> 00:59:48,514
If you like artists, look at the artists they are looking at

1162
00:59:48,874 --> 00:59:50,254
instead of looking at their work.

1163
00:59:51,294 --> 00:59:52,395
Yeah. Thanks.

1164
00:59:53,700 --> 01:00:00,082
I'm going to add something that as well that with the reference gathering that I do I often find it really helpful to

1165
01:00:01,162 --> 01:00:03,103
Involve the rest of the character team as well

1166
01:00:03,443 --> 01:00:07,244
Especially if you know which model is going to work on or which animator is going to work on it

1167
01:00:08,164 --> 01:00:10,345
Get them involved really early. There's a

1168
01:00:11,025 --> 01:00:15,847
There's a there's a part of the character production in games which seems to separate those groups and some

1169
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:21,195
people get turned into just 3D machines and other people are sort of left with

1170
01:00:21,556 --> 01:00:25,520
probably too much responsibility and not enough people chiming in.

1171
01:00:26,081 --> 01:00:27,862
So I think it's really good when you're collecting that reference,

1172
01:00:28,563 --> 01:00:32,027
I go and chat to the character modeler as well and I get them collecting references as well,

1173
01:00:32,047 --> 01:00:34,449
so they're invested, they've got ideas in there also.

1174
01:00:36,907 --> 01:00:37,147
Hi.

1175
01:00:37,888 --> 01:00:42,009
So a quick question on the decision-making process that

1176
01:00:42,029 --> 01:00:42,749
you guys do.

1177
01:00:43,509 --> 01:00:46,470
When you go through the girl with the glasses, at what

1178
01:00:46,570 --> 01:00:50,131
point do you think it's safe to expose your concept art and

1179
01:00:50,291 --> 01:00:54,313
the entire story to outside of the art department,

1180
01:00:54,353 --> 01:00:54,933
essentially?

1181
01:00:55,113 --> 01:00:58,094
And how do you prevent randomization from biz dev

1182
01:00:58,154 --> 01:01:02,695
people who are maybe not so great at looking at the full

1183
01:01:02,735 --> 01:01:04,396
story and saying, OK, we get it.

1184
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:10,935
I think the, I mean once you've got those scenes set up,

1185
01:01:11,055 --> 01:01:13,417
I think it's safe to start at least at the moment.

1186
01:01:13,677 --> 01:01:14,878
Nothing's ever going to be perfect.

1187
01:01:14,938 --> 01:01:16,399
It's a really organic process.

1188
01:01:17,139 --> 01:01:18,800
No game is ever the same to work on.

1189
01:01:19,421 --> 01:01:20,361
You're always going to get,

1190
01:01:21,562 --> 01:01:23,103
at least at Naughty Dog it's very flat.

1191
01:01:23,363 --> 01:01:24,784
So you're going to get a lot of opinions

1192
01:01:24,804 --> 01:01:26,105
from different departments.

1193
01:01:27,105 --> 01:01:28,406
And you've got to be flexible on that.

1194
01:01:28,606 --> 01:01:29,447
And you've got to realize

1195
01:01:29,507 --> 01:01:32,428
that your idea's not always going to be the best.

1196
01:01:33,309 --> 01:01:35,550
And even, you know, it might not be.

1197
01:01:36,311 --> 01:01:37,791
your taste that we're going for.

1198
01:01:37,872 --> 01:01:43,113
So my advice would be to put your best foot forward,

1199
01:01:43,173 --> 01:01:47,354
but always be flexible when those opinions come in.

1200
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:50,355
It's a tough thing, I think, as concept artists,

1201
01:01:50,655 --> 01:01:53,456
especially if you're sitting near a hallway, as I do,

1202
01:01:53,476 --> 01:01:54,036
a walkway.

1203
01:01:54,837 --> 01:01:57,017
You're constantly having people like, oh, what's that?

1204
01:01:57,237 --> 01:01:57,898
What's this character about?

1205
01:01:58,658 --> 01:02:00,358
You're like, hey, yeah, the 10th time today.

1206
01:02:00,378 --> 01:02:01,399
You're like, oh, OK.

1207
01:02:01,879 --> 01:02:02,579
Chat about it again.

1208
01:02:05,523 --> 01:02:11,526
It's tough but I think you have to be flexible and remember that it's not your baby.

1209
01:02:12,387 --> 01:02:14,528
It's a big group of super talented people.

1210
01:02:15,049 --> 01:02:18,111
And the best thing you can do is make sure that they're excited about something.

1211
01:02:18,271 --> 01:02:23,074
I would say take the time and stay flexible and don't sit in the corner and do it in isolation.

1212
01:02:23,674 --> 01:02:23,995
Thank you.

1213
01:02:32,272 --> 01:02:35,253
pushing away from some of the tropes, archetypes, stereotypes.

1214
01:02:36,034 --> 01:02:39,035
I'm wondering how you guys strike the balance between sort of familiar,

1215
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:43,277
easily understandable, clear concepts, and more nuanced

1216
01:02:44,237 --> 01:02:46,338
characters with depth. How do you guys walk that line?

1217
01:02:47,739 --> 01:02:50,320
Team effort, I imagine.

1218
01:02:50,420 --> 01:02:54,122
I can say from my point of view, we look a lot at film,

1219
01:02:54,382 --> 01:02:55,282
costuming in film.

1220
01:02:56,423 --> 01:02:59,864
We like to keep it, you know, still fairly heavy-handed with Uncharted.

1221
01:02:59,924 --> 01:03:01,325
The Last of Us is a little bit...

1222
01:03:01,810 --> 01:03:10,115
more subtle. But I mean we have such amazing animators and acting and script and everything

1223
01:03:10,155 --> 01:03:15,798
going on. There is so many other things in play that educate the audience including the

1224
01:03:15,858 --> 01:03:23,983
framing and stuff that I was talking about as to how we go about presenting that. I mean

1225
01:03:24,223 --> 01:03:26,584
subtle for me at the moment is always the best plan.

1226
01:03:28,393 --> 01:03:31,995
I would say that the majority of characters I'm drawing at the moment are like t-shirt

1227
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:32,736
and jeans.

1228
01:03:33,677 --> 01:03:34,217
You know what I mean?

1229
01:03:34,237 --> 01:03:37,860
Like, I just sit around with a lot of photos and sketch them up and like, that's another

1230
01:03:37,880 --> 01:03:38,720
dude in t-shirt and jeans.

1231
01:03:39,060 --> 01:03:39,741
Keep it real subtle.

1232
01:03:40,121 --> 01:03:42,022
That person's going to behave in a certain way.

1233
01:03:42,082 --> 01:03:44,044
The tough guy one is a really interesting narrative.

1234
01:03:44,084 --> 01:03:45,585
We were talking about it over lunch.

1235
01:03:46,025 --> 01:03:48,447
You know, Joe Pesci is one of my favorite tough guys.

1236
01:03:49,047 --> 01:03:51,449
If I did him in a lineup of tough guys, no one's going to pick him.

1237
01:03:52,030 --> 01:03:55,994
But when you're in that scene and there's that tension and he's scaring the hell out

1238
01:03:56,014 --> 01:03:58,997
of everyone, then that comes across.

1239
01:03:59,638 --> 01:04:04,843
So I don't know, to answer your question, thematically there's some really nice things

1240
01:04:04,863 --> 01:04:11,510
you can play to in a game as subtle as The Last of Us, but my intention is always to

1241
01:04:11,710 --> 01:04:15,634
support everything else that's going on and not to distract from it.

1242
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,411
Yeah.

1243
01:04:17,651 --> 01:04:18,031
Oh, no.

1244
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:18,912
Go.

1245
01:04:19,032 --> 01:04:23,275
I think it really depends on the narrative of the game as well, or the narrative of anything

1246
01:04:23,295 --> 01:04:27,617
you're doing, and the needs of that narrative, and how viewers are supposed to feel about

1247
01:04:27,637 --> 01:04:29,098
that narrative while they're experiencing it.

1248
01:04:30,919 --> 01:04:34,742
And you sort of have, like, if you have to concept it, like a nerdy character, you're

1249
01:04:34,762 --> 01:04:37,484
like, well, nerds have glasses, so I'll put them in glasses.

1250
01:04:37,644 --> 01:04:42,027
And that's sort of, like, it's obvious, it may be the right thing to do, but it's not

1251
01:04:42,107 --> 01:04:43,367
so much that you have to, like...

1252
01:04:44,187 --> 01:04:47,008
do like totally be like, no, nerds can't have glasses

1253
01:04:47,028 --> 01:04:47,909
because they always have glasses.

1254
01:04:48,369 --> 01:04:52,231
Like it's not, it's more like, do whatever,

1255
01:04:52,251 --> 01:04:54,191
do what you're doing, but do it with intention.

1256
01:04:54,271 --> 01:04:57,513
Like say, the character, the audience has to feel this way.

1257
01:04:58,233 --> 01:05:01,094
So my choices are going towards that.

1258
01:05:01,314 --> 01:05:05,696
So it's like, if I want a character to, again,

1259
01:05:05,756 --> 01:05:07,857
feel vulnerable, make them physically small.

1260
01:05:08,397 --> 01:05:09,238
If you want them to,

1261
01:05:11,812 --> 01:05:17,654
blend in, maybe they have, they don't contain any bright colors, maybe all the values are

1262
01:05:17,674 --> 01:05:21,395
sort of close together and so when they're put into their context they sort of blend

1263
01:05:21,435 --> 01:05:21,995
in a little bit more.

1264
01:05:22,015 --> 01:05:26,977
So it's thinking about all of those things and making a character whatever style it's

1265
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:30,238
in to be unique and whatever it needs to be for its context.

1266
01:05:32,487 --> 01:05:37,893
I was just going to say that I love looking at dogs as good inspiration for character

1267
01:05:37,933 --> 01:05:43,640
design in terms of you can have really shitty little dogs and really sweet little dogs and

1268
01:05:43,680 --> 01:05:46,503
the physicality of them is not really...

1269
01:05:47,524 --> 01:05:49,904
it does not really define who they are as a character,

1270
01:05:50,025 --> 01:05:52,085
and it's great to think of character designs that same way.

1271
01:05:52,125 --> 01:05:53,665
It's like the acting and animation,

1272
01:05:53,765 --> 01:05:55,805
which again is why you involve those teams,

1273
01:05:56,326 --> 01:05:57,906
can bring so much to those characters

1274
01:05:58,026 --> 01:06:00,546
and can actually play against the expectations

1275
01:06:00,606 --> 01:06:02,807
that the audience has in really interesting ways.

1276
01:06:02,827 --> 01:06:07,567
That's awesome.

1277
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:11,188
Does that answer your question?

1278
01:06:12,428 --> 01:06:14,069
Absolutely, I was just standing here

1279
01:06:14,089 --> 01:06:16,109
to encourage the responses continuing.

1280
01:06:16,169 --> 01:06:16,729
Thank you for that.

1281
01:06:18,005 --> 01:06:21,506
It'd be a blast to hear from the whole panel if you'd like to share some thoughts as well.

1282
01:06:22,487 --> 01:06:23,908
Not to eat up the whole time frame for us.

1283
01:06:23,928 --> 01:06:25,008
Is this thing on? Okay.

1284
01:06:26,709 --> 01:06:33,172
You know, one of the things that I've experimented a lot with is basing character design on shape.

1285
01:06:33,873 --> 01:06:41,336
So all of my characters, or the main characters that I usually do, are based on some sort of base shape.

1286
01:06:41,857 --> 01:06:45,358
And then I try to squish them and see what that makes them do.

1287
01:06:46,028 --> 01:06:49,329
So I have one character that I like in particular called Alphonse.

1288
01:06:49,690 --> 01:06:51,310
I designed him to be a pear.

1289
01:06:51,991 --> 01:06:52,671
That's what he was.

1290
01:06:54,012 --> 01:06:59,294
And part of his personality came from just trying to see him run.

1291
01:06:59,314 --> 01:07:03,276
Because, you know, he was a big guy.

1292
01:07:03,516 --> 01:07:11,120
But it was interesting because I started thinking about how does the mechanics work?

1293
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,001
Because he had like a large, bulbous...

1294
01:07:15,734 --> 01:07:18,897
Well, bottom and let's just say that.

1295
01:07:19,998 --> 01:07:24,181
But I started thinking about it and I realized that this doesn't make sense

1296
01:07:24,281 --> 01:07:26,103
and not for his anatomy.

1297
01:07:26,283 --> 01:07:26,943
Why is that?

1298
01:07:27,744 --> 01:07:30,566
And eventually it hit me that he's a robot.

1299
01:07:31,447 --> 01:07:35,450
And because he's a robot, that implies a lot of the way he acts

1300
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:36,651
and the way he does things.

1301
01:07:36,732 --> 01:07:38,553
And I ended up doing that with all the characters.

1302
01:07:40,330 --> 01:07:44,472
I had a main character whose face was just kind of a big oval,

1303
01:07:46,093 --> 01:07:48,434
and to kind of even that out I gave him a big hat.

1304
01:07:48,514 --> 01:07:51,976
But because I gave him the hat, it gave him a lot of expressive traits.

1305
01:07:52,256 --> 01:07:56,199
One of the reasons why he ended up being really shy and kind of cowardly

1306
01:07:56,279 --> 01:07:59,140
was because he had to interact with his hat.

1307
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,441
What do you do with it? Well, you pull it down over your head.

1308
01:08:03,173 --> 01:08:09,522
It's, I feel like shape and just squishing them and using them and throwing them around,

1309
01:08:10,063 --> 01:08:12,607
that's a way to get to know your character.

1310
01:08:14,130 --> 01:08:15,011
I think that's about all I got.

1311
01:08:19,651 --> 01:08:21,633
Hi, this is a question for Richard.

1312
01:08:22,313 --> 01:08:24,635
So your work is a lot of really beautiful line work

1313
01:08:24,655 --> 01:08:26,457
with like a solid color underneath.

1314
01:08:26,877 --> 01:08:28,298
I'm just wondering from like more

1315
01:08:28,318 --> 01:08:30,020
of a technical execution standpoint,

1316
01:08:30,040 --> 01:08:31,981
like how do you tackle designs that ask for

1317
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,923
like unique texture?

1318
01:08:34,163 --> 01:08:35,725
Or is that something that you ever encounter

1319
01:08:35,825 --> 01:08:36,505
during your work?

1320
01:08:36,885 --> 01:08:40,569
And you have to like show texture in a flat color

1321
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:42,911
or a line work without sort of painting.

1322
01:08:43,051 --> 01:08:44,292
Is that something that you do

1323
01:08:44,432 --> 01:08:45,613
or do you have ways to get around it?

1324
01:08:46,648 --> 01:08:55,432
I think that the line work and the way I'm approaching art at the moment is interesting for me, just as an artist, so I've started doing it over the last couple of years.

1325
01:08:56,152 --> 01:09:01,175
Also I'm fortunate enough at our studio that our creative director's a big comic fan.

1326
01:09:01,255 --> 01:09:06,417
Neil Druckmann's a massive comic nerd, so he loves seeing that stuff and he's able to read it really well.

1327
01:09:07,417 --> 01:09:13,960
We're also working on projects where things are in known quantity, you know, jeans, sneakers.

1328
01:09:16,091 --> 01:09:19,752
I don't know how many dudes I drew with machine guns, but they get it.

1329
01:09:19,792 --> 01:09:21,413
It's an army boot, it's army pants.

1330
01:09:22,013 --> 01:09:25,814
So once again, I'm collecting reference and I'm talking to those character modelers,

1331
01:09:25,874 --> 01:09:27,094
so everyone's on the same page.

1332
01:09:27,154 --> 01:09:30,735
By the time I spit out those lineups of concepts,

1333
01:09:31,816 --> 01:09:33,316
everyone understands what they're looking at,

1334
01:09:33,516 --> 01:09:36,797
because we've sat around and we've talked about what kind of materials we can execute on.

1335
01:09:37,737 --> 01:09:41,759
You chat to technical riggers about secondary motion for your army guys,

1336
01:09:41,839 --> 01:09:45,240
and your material artists about the difference between a...

1337
01:09:46,025 --> 01:09:48,887
Fatigue and a hand grenade or whatever else is gonna be there

1338
01:09:49,228 --> 01:09:53,471
So I'm very lucky in that regard that we have that open conversation. There are other characters where

1339
01:09:54,172 --> 01:09:59,876
You know, you have to paint the bejesus out of it your photo bashing hell out of it for those that played uncharted 4

1340
01:10:00,737 --> 01:10:02,399
There's a couple of characters. I worked on

1341
01:10:03,660 --> 01:10:06,762
That are you know executed to a borderline photo

1342
01:10:07,383 --> 01:10:13,208
rendering state the old adventurer who passes away in the mansion

1343
01:10:13,428 --> 01:10:13,928
spoilers

1344
01:10:15,639 --> 01:10:20,903
There's an old adventurer. So for that one you had to take a different tact. So that's very much photo bashed

1345
01:10:22,484 --> 01:10:27,528
Does it answer your question? Yeah, so like you kind of take a different way to approach it instead of the line art

1346
01:10:27,568 --> 01:10:30,089
if you need a texture work, yeah, I think I think I've

1347
01:10:31,270 --> 01:10:36,674
It made sense to me because I'm already trying to be incredibly social on the floor and with the rest of the character department

1348
01:10:36,714 --> 01:10:42,758
right and I find that things go a lot more smoothly by being that way and then all of a sudden it didn't make sense to

1349
01:10:42,818 --> 01:10:44,620
Be rendering the hell out of everything

1350
01:10:45,187 --> 01:10:48,168
So, I mean, everyone that needs to know just sat down and looked at the reference,

1351
01:10:48,929 --> 01:10:53,471
and now I'm photo bashing that reference back into something, you know, it didn't make any sense.

1352
01:10:53,511 --> 01:10:54,932
So what's left to decide?

1353
01:10:55,092 --> 01:10:58,734
Shape, language, the weighting of the character, where these elements are going to be.

1354
01:10:59,455 --> 01:11:03,877
So for me, I sort of fell into this line art, comic book type stuff.

1355
01:11:04,537 --> 01:11:06,238
And plus, it's really fun and it's super quick.

1356
01:11:06,258 --> 01:11:08,720
You can just, you know, you can bash them out really fast.

1357
01:11:09,200 --> 01:11:09,760
All right. Thank you.

1358
01:11:10,260 --> 01:11:13,663
I do think that's a super important point about concept art, though, is that it's not

1359
01:11:13,683 --> 01:11:15,765
about making finished illustrations.

1360
01:11:16,306 --> 01:11:19,549
It's very tempting to finish these things and polish them because it's all about your

1361
01:11:19,629 --> 01:11:19,769
art.

1362
01:11:20,189 --> 01:11:24,994
You're part of this larger pipeline, and so you need to communicate just enough to whoever's

1363
01:11:25,034 --> 01:11:25,995
next in that pipeline.

1364
01:11:26,815 --> 01:11:31,277
And, yeah, I've often found that when I was younger in the industry, I would just painstakingly

1365
01:11:31,357 --> 01:11:35,558
render these things because I wanted the accolades of having beautifully painted a thing.

1366
01:11:35,978 --> 01:11:40,179
But I could have just as easily done line art, flats, and then call out textures, and

1367
01:11:40,239 --> 01:11:43,060
would have communicated it just as well, possibly better.

1368
01:11:43,740 --> 01:11:45,200
So being a concept artist, I know.

1369
01:11:45,680 --> 01:11:51,182
You go to ArtStation and start looking through portfolios where everything's just polished to a T,

1370
01:11:51,582 --> 01:11:56,864
but sometimes it's a bunch of polish on a bad design. I'd rather see an unfinished good design

1371
01:11:56,904 --> 01:12:02,906
that communicates well, rather than something that's been painted for a week on end that's useless.

1372
01:12:04,226 --> 01:12:09,067
That is the most important thing I think anyone has said today. It's really confusing for concept

1373
01:12:09,147 --> 01:12:12,388
artists. You look at CGTalk, you look at ArtStation, you see all this marvelous art.

1374
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:14,562
It's not about that.

1375
01:12:14,802 --> 01:12:15,844
It's about making a game.

1376
01:12:16,205 --> 01:12:20,492
So, you know, sorry, I can't emphasize that here.

1377
01:12:20,593 --> 01:12:21,454
That's a very good point.

1378
01:12:21,715 --> 01:12:22,616
You're making a video game,

1379
01:12:22,636 --> 01:12:23,979
you're not making an art exhibition.

1380
01:12:24,059 --> 01:12:25,281
Thank you.

1381
01:12:27,516 --> 01:12:30,419
Hi, this is question for Laura.

1382
01:12:30,820 --> 01:12:35,365
When you mentioned you just combined some features of face of different

1383
01:12:35,405 --> 01:12:40,031
emotions like emotions like like like like a surprise or sorrow.

1384
01:12:40,832 --> 01:12:45,578
You combine them like randomly or there's a rule behind

1385
01:12:47,480 --> 01:12:54,044
There's definitely thought on which aspects of which one you might combine, and that really

1386
01:12:54,104 --> 01:12:59,468
comes down to sort of performance and your own feeling about what it ought to be.

1387
01:12:59,508 --> 01:13:02,790
That's why I say keep a mirror around, so if you're thinking like, okay, I have this

1388
01:13:03,290 --> 01:13:05,031
situation that I want to make an expression for.

1389
01:13:07,232 --> 01:13:08,833
and what face does my character make?

1390
01:13:08,893 --> 01:13:11,533
And so you can kind of test it out in the mirror.

1391
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:14,454
And once you kind of have something there,

1392
01:13:14,474 --> 01:13:21,295
you can think, okay, maybe this character feels derisive

1393
01:13:21,395 --> 01:13:23,215
compared to the person he's talking to.

1394
01:13:23,435 --> 01:13:24,275
He's looking down at them,

1395
01:13:24,295 --> 01:13:25,976
so maybe he's kind of sneering

1396
01:13:26,016 --> 01:13:26,956
with a little bit of disgust.

1397
01:13:26,976 --> 01:13:31,417
So you're adding a bit of a lip curl to that face.

1398
01:13:32,477 --> 01:13:34,377
So it's really, it's an artistic tool.

1399
01:13:34,417 --> 01:13:35,077
It's not like.

1400
01:13:35,880 --> 01:13:42,184
A plus B equals C. It's a way to sort of break it down and think about what you're doing.

1401
01:13:42,204 --> 01:13:44,785
Yeah, that's about it.

1402
01:13:44,825 --> 01:13:47,547
So you just like try to be an actor?

1403
01:13:47,867 --> 01:13:51,769
Basically, yeah. It's what animators do. It is just what they do.

1404
01:13:52,729 --> 01:13:56,771
And they've known this for a long time, so this would be not very new to them.

1405
01:13:56,872 --> 01:14:00,433
But for 2D artists, I found it was new to me anyway.

1406
01:14:00,453 --> 01:14:01,634
Okay, thank you.

1407
01:14:04,296 --> 01:14:05,236
My question is for Simon.

1408
01:14:05,997 --> 01:14:09,237
You had a very long development process of almost 10 years.

1409
01:14:09,577 --> 01:14:13,518
So I was wondering how often you had to reiterate your main characters

1410
01:14:13,579 --> 01:14:15,879
or any of your characters in terms of design

1411
01:14:16,019 --> 01:14:19,180
and how important it was for bringing other artists to look at your work.

1412
01:14:19,660 --> 01:14:23,601
Yeah, it was nine months. No, nine years minus one month.

1413
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:25,882
So it was quite some time.

1414
01:14:27,722 --> 01:14:31,423
The main character actually was a point of contention because...

1415
01:14:33,238 --> 01:14:36,279
It was literally one of the first things I made

1416
01:14:36,319 --> 01:14:38,740
for the project and after working on it

1417
01:14:38,760 --> 01:14:40,660
for maybe five years and realizing

1418
01:14:40,700 --> 01:14:42,160
that it's not really all that good,

1419
01:14:43,181 --> 01:14:45,901
you can't just trade out about 200 animations.

1420
01:14:46,481 --> 01:14:49,462
So what we did instead was that we compensated

1421
01:14:49,522 --> 01:14:51,042
by making the animations more fluid

1422
01:14:51,822 --> 01:14:55,023
and giving more emphasis on what you did.

1423
01:14:55,663 --> 01:14:57,784
So we did a talk yesterday where we showed

1424
01:14:58,604 --> 01:15:00,244
the difference between the running animations

1425
01:15:00,324 --> 01:15:02,065
on the beginning and afterwards.

1426
01:15:02,747 --> 01:15:07,968
showing how you did turn cycles and you added emphasis to movement when you flew and that

1427
01:15:08,008 --> 01:15:08,508
sort of thing.

1428
01:15:10,848 --> 01:15:16,730
In terms of the game itself, the good thing about the game was that we didn't do the game

1429
01:15:16,830 --> 01:15:19,050
with tilesets, we did it with assets.

1430
01:15:19,790 --> 01:15:22,991
So it was big pixel chunks that you could put anywhere.

1431
01:15:23,711 --> 01:15:27,312
And incidentally, that also means that they're fairly easy to replace.

1432
01:15:29,272 --> 01:15:29,813
We did...

1433
01:15:31,838 --> 01:15:37,640
very big pieces, and mostly the really old stuff

1434
01:15:37,680 --> 01:15:40,301
was in the very middle of the game.

1435
01:15:40,841 --> 01:15:42,821
So when you're flying through that part,

1436
01:15:42,861 --> 01:15:47,003
the quality is kind of, mm, there.

1437
01:15:47,523 --> 01:15:50,804
The tutorial levels were sort of late development,

1438
01:15:50,864 --> 01:15:53,365
and then the very last stages, I think I did something

1439
01:15:53,385 --> 01:15:56,806
like a 3,000 pixel scroll, just to show

1440
01:15:56,846 --> 01:15:59,547
that I could do something proper for once.

1441
01:15:59,567 --> 01:15:59,607
So.

1442
01:16:02,368 --> 01:16:05,070
I feel like that was a good way to compensate.

1443
01:16:05,330 --> 01:16:06,991
Sure, the sprite is fairly old,

1444
01:16:07,071 --> 01:16:09,633
but animation is always appreciated.

1445
01:16:09,713 --> 01:16:11,174
So that was how we solved that.

1446
01:16:12,075 --> 01:16:12,355
Thank you.

1447
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:17,719
I'd like to thank the panel for a wonderful presentation.

1448
01:16:17,899 --> 01:16:20,381
And if there are any further audience questions,

1449
01:16:20,421 --> 01:16:22,382
the breakout room across the hall is available.

1450
01:16:22,402 --> 01:16:24,424
Awesome, thank you. Thank you.
