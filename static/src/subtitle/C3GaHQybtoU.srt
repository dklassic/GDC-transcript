00:00:01,216 --> 00:00:04,897
Our next speaker will discuss the power of focusing on what you do,

2
00:00:05,397 --> 00:00:08,418
rather than what you say in the face of adversity.

3
00:00:09,418 --> 00:00:13,139
Please welcome to the stage, founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray. ♪♪

4
00:00:26,683 --> 00:00:27,003
Hello.

5
00:00:30,727 --> 00:00:31,668
I'm Sean Murray.

6
00:00:32,849 --> 00:00:37,852
The folks at GDC asked me to talk about my journey

7
00:00:37,892 --> 00:00:40,434
as a game developer, and in particular,

8
00:00:40,554 --> 00:00:43,476
about releasing games.

9
00:00:43,696 --> 00:00:47,338
So if this talk goes horribly wrong,

10
00:00:47,418 --> 00:00:50,220
and my slides fail, and all that kind of thing,

11
00:00:50,260 --> 00:00:54,043
it's just a clever analogy for releasing games

12
00:00:54,083 --> 00:00:55,043
that I have devised.

13
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,641
But the truth is I've never met a developer who

14
00:01:00,741 --> 00:01:03,482
finds releasing games easy.

15
00:01:06,123 --> 00:01:10,205
It always requires grit, and game development is hard.

16
00:01:13,987 --> 00:01:17,628
I've been lucky enough to work on a lot of very successful

17
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:21,450
games, but I've always found emotionally the lowest point

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,271
for me in development is releasing a game.

19
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:29,212
It's not actually been until our most recent project, No Man's Sky,

20
00:01:29,272 --> 00:01:32,654
that I learned to actually become a lot more zen about it,

21
00:01:33,955 --> 00:01:37,797
to enjoy it, and to learn how to take a team through it.

22
00:01:40,379 --> 00:01:44,581
No Man's Sky was this crazy, innovative, ambitious game.

23
00:01:44,601 --> 00:01:48,063
It was a procedural universe, something nobody had done before.

24
00:01:49,124 --> 00:01:51,425
And when we would show it to people, we would be excited,

25
00:01:51,485 --> 00:01:52,466
they would get excited.

26
00:01:53,006 --> 00:01:54,247
And before we knew it, we were.

27
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:59,392
building a rocket ship on the way up, blasting towards the sun.

28
00:02:02,293 --> 00:02:07,655
No Man's Sky, when it released, and also still two years later,

29
00:02:08,036 --> 00:02:09,276
has sold incredibly well.

30
00:02:09,336 --> 00:02:12,138
It's gone on to be one of the biggest selling

31
00:02:12,538 --> 00:02:15,159
new IPs of all time, which sounds

32
00:02:15,199 --> 00:02:16,580
really weird to say out loud.

33
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:21,362
But our release was also one of the most intense and dramatic

34
00:02:21,402 --> 00:02:23,383
that I think the games industry has seen.

35
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:29,474
This is something that's becoming increasingly common in the industry.

36
00:02:30,795 --> 00:02:38,504
A lot of games have faced this before us and after us, but unlike some of those,

37
00:02:38,864 --> 00:02:43,649
we weren't facing just one technical issue that we could fix, and we also were a tiny team.

38
00:02:45,527 --> 00:02:48,268
Six people on average making No Man's Sky.

39
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:51,090
We were just 15 when we launched,

40
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:52,150
and we were a little family.

41
00:02:52,771 --> 00:02:55,332
And as a family, post-release, we

42
00:02:55,412 --> 00:02:58,634
faced some really difficult challenges.

43
00:02:59,714 --> 00:03:02,856
Everything that you can imagine from the worst of the internet,

44
00:03:04,197 --> 00:03:04,677
we hit.

45
00:03:05,878 --> 00:03:08,799
Regular intervention from police and Scotland Yard and things

46
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:09,199
like that.

47
00:03:10,468 --> 00:03:12,589
And I don't really want to talk about that side of things,

48
00:03:12,629 --> 00:03:14,310
because I think that kind of toxicity

49
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:16,532
and those toxic individuals already control too much

50
00:03:16,572 --> 00:03:17,893
of the narrative around games.

51
00:03:19,114 --> 00:03:21,475
Instead, I'd like to talk about how we move forward as a team.

52
00:03:23,917 --> 00:03:26,899
Because now we find ourselves mentioned as that benchmark

53
00:03:26,919 --> 00:03:27,599
for coming back.

54
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:32,102
Doing in No Man's Sky is now a positive thing.

55
00:03:32,783 --> 00:03:35,325
Two years out from launch, like I was saying,

56
00:03:35,345 --> 00:03:37,226
we're selling kind of numbers that.

57
00:03:38,707 --> 00:03:42,269
I think most AAA games would be really proud of for their launch.

58
00:03:43,690 --> 00:03:48,573
But more importantly, we have a very positive, probably one of the most positive communities

59
00:03:48,893 --> 00:03:51,755
of any game that has launched.

60
00:03:54,296 --> 00:03:58,018
During those darker days, though, it would have been very easy to quit.

61
00:03:58,038 --> 00:04:00,640
It would have been almost expected or the norm.

62
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,762
But two things forced me to get out of bed every morning.

63
00:04:05,687 --> 00:04:07,549
was that we could see something that others couldn't.

64
00:04:07,629 --> 00:04:09,671
We could see hundreds of thousands of people

65
00:04:09,751 --> 00:04:10,992
playing the game every day.

66
00:04:13,114 --> 00:04:16,897
An average play time of 25 hours across millions of players.

67
00:04:16,957 --> 00:04:18,579
We knew that people were enjoying the game

68
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:19,920
and wanted to enjoy it more.

69
00:04:20,440 --> 00:04:24,204
The second thing that really made me want to get out

70
00:04:24,244 --> 00:04:24,864
and fight is this.

71
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:29,639
The narrative around games that launch like this

72
00:04:29,719 --> 00:04:33,501
becomes about the team being maybe dishonest or lazy

73
00:04:33,541 --> 00:04:34,141
or something like that.

74
00:04:34,181 --> 00:04:37,522
I've never met a lazy developer.

75
00:04:37,642 --> 00:04:39,863
I've probably made bad mistakes in my time.

76
00:04:39,943 --> 00:04:43,704
But the team, the fucking team at Hello Games

77
00:04:44,045 --> 00:04:47,766
are incredibly talented and so incredibly hardworking.

78
00:04:48,326 --> 00:04:51,347
And so I felt like their legacy deserved to be correct.

79
00:04:54,678 --> 00:04:59,199
So at first, the intensity of that feedback was overwhelming.

80
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,160
But I decided you either had to hide or you had to face it.

81
00:05:03,260 --> 00:05:05,721
So I did something that I wouldn't recommend,

82
00:05:05,801 --> 00:05:08,481
but I decided to drink from the firehose.

83
00:05:09,582 --> 00:05:11,542
Every mail that you send to Hello Games

84
00:05:11,902 --> 00:05:14,703
goes directly to my phone and to my watch.

85
00:05:15,023 --> 00:05:16,483
We didn't block or mute people.

86
00:05:17,503 --> 00:05:19,944
If you talked about No Man's Sky, then I probably read it.

87
00:05:21,482 --> 00:05:22,843
Again, I wouldn't really recommend it,

88
00:05:22,923 --> 00:05:24,985
but it helped me gain a new perspective.

89
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:27,926
And that perspective is that everything is just data.

90
00:05:29,648 --> 00:05:32,149
I sat down to categorize everything.

91
00:05:32,229 --> 00:05:34,030
I brought in people externally to do it.

92
00:05:34,070 --> 00:05:35,511
And we learned a lot from that.

93
00:05:36,192 --> 00:05:38,833
For instance, we learned that the most toxic commentary,

94
00:05:39,174 --> 00:05:41,195
about 80% to 90% of it, was coming

95
00:05:41,235 --> 00:05:43,016
from people who weren't really invested in the game.

96
00:05:43,957 --> 00:05:44,517
They were.

97
00:05:45,503 --> 00:05:49,724
talking online about topics that are very common and very

98
00:05:49,784 --> 00:05:53,325
recognizable and most games become a lightning rod for,

99
00:05:53,385 --> 00:05:56,926
like pre-orders or marketing or whatever,

100
00:05:57,826 --> 00:06:01,007
they aren't providing good data to you as a developer.

101
00:06:02,547 --> 00:06:06,368
That is where a lot of press and prominent voices focus.

102
00:06:06,408 --> 00:06:08,929
But we actually began to uncover the ground truth

103
00:06:09,269 --> 00:06:09,929
underneath that.

104
00:06:11,082 --> 00:06:15,045
The second most negative cohort of players

105
00:06:15,306 --> 00:06:17,868
was actually people who had played the game for about 100

106
00:06:17,948 --> 00:06:19,309
hours in the first week.

107
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:22,772
And their feedback was actually incredibly useful.

108
00:06:23,853 --> 00:06:28,276
Suddenly, from this overwhelming noise of millions of hot takes,

109
00:06:29,297 --> 00:06:31,059
we discovered some ground truth.

110
00:06:31,946 --> 00:06:36,729
some real incredibly clear signals, like 37% of people

111
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:40,552
were stopping playing or frustrated in playing just

112
00:06:40,572 --> 00:06:42,333
because they didn't like the inventory system.

113
00:06:42,994 --> 00:06:45,555
And suddenly you're like, that I can fix.

114
00:06:45,816 --> 00:06:47,877
I could sit down at my computer, and I could fix that.

115
00:06:48,197 --> 00:06:49,678
Not just that, I agree with you.

116
00:06:50,499 --> 00:06:51,560
And now we know what we're doing.

117
00:06:52,220 --> 00:06:54,301
We're back making games for people who want to play them.

118
00:06:56,054 --> 00:06:59,975
Now partly I did all of this gathering and daily gathering

119
00:07:00,336 --> 00:07:01,716
for the team to shield them.

120
00:07:01,816 --> 00:07:05,137
They knew they didn't have to go out and look at Twitter

121
00:07:05,157 --> 00:07:07,718
or whatever because it was being taken care of.

122
00:07:08,178 --> 00:07:11,200
They could look at raw spreadsheets of cold, hard data.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:14,741
We also created this Tumblr internally for the team.

124
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:18,202
And anything where we found that we were making an impact

125
00:07:18,262 --> 00:07:21,583
and people were contacting us, we put that on the Tumblr.

126
00:07:22,704 --> 00:07:23,604
Nothing is more.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,061
motivating for you who's going through a hard time

128
00:07:28,101 --> 00:07:29,642
than knowing that the work that you do

129
00:07:29,742 --> 00:07:32,103
is helping other people who are going through similar things.

130
00:07:36,244 --> 00:07:39,325
Meanwhile, we learned that press wasn't necessarily

131
00:07:39,365 --> 00:07:41,806
the best way for us to communicate with our players.

132
00:07:43,007 --> 00:07:46,448
When I grew up, the press kind of led my thinking.

133
00:07:46,528 --> 00:07:48,569
I read Edge or whatever to tell me

134
00:07:48,849 --> 00:07:51,250
how to feel about development and developers.

135
00:07:52,635 --> 00:07:56,976
In 2016 or 2018, we found for a variety of reasons

136
00:07:58,416 --> 00:08:01,037
the press kind of operates downstream from the community.

137
00:08:01,757 --> 00:08:04,318
Because things are click-driven as to what stories you get

138
00:08:04,358 --> 00:08:06,078
served and things like that, we would

139
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,899
find that glowing articles would disappear from the front page,

140
00:08:09,299 --> 00:08:11,800
but a rumor would surface from Reddit straight

141
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:13,580
to the front page of every website

142
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:15,981
in a ridiculously quick amount of time.

143
00:08:16,701 --> 00:08:18,421
So if we wanted to talk to our players,

144
00:08:19,477 --> 00:08:20,717
We needed to do it directly.

145
00:08:20,757 --> 00:08:23,057
So we just shut down all communication with the press.

146
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:24,898
And it was fun.

147
00:08:24,918 --> 00:08:26,118
I really enjoyed that.

148
00:08:26,418 --> 00:08:28,498
I've never wanted to talk to the press in the first place.

149
00:08:28,518 --> 00:08:29,999
I've never really got into games for that.

150
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,679
And I think I'm terrible at it.

151
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:35,080
So it felt like us being true to who we were as a company.

152
00:08:36,580 --> 00:08:39,001
Now, obviously, yes, listen to the community.

153
00:08:39,021 --> 00:08:42,601
It's very important for problems,

154
00:08:42,701 --> 00:08:44,542
not necessarily for solutions.

155
00:08:45,562 --> 00:08:46,862
We changed the game radically.

156
00:08:46,902 --> 00:08:48,523
We changed it in line with our own vision.

157
00:08:51,482 --> 00:08:54,225
Someone at Valve, who was a fan of the game, said to me,

158
00:08:54,485 --> 00:08:56,907
what you do now is more important than what you say.

159
00:08:56,927 --> 00:09:00,290
I can't tell you how many times I sat down

160
00:09:00,330 --> 00:09:02,692
to write a blog post to explain to people

161
00:09:02,752 --> 00:09:08,116
our side of the story or calm the storm or set things right.

162
00:09:08,637 --> 00:09:10,518
However, as a developer of a release game,

163
00:09:10,598 --> 00:09:13,721
I think that there's only one thing that's credible,

164
00:09:13,761 --> 00:09:14,642
and that's your actions.

165
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:16,664
We decided.

166
00:09:17,740 --> 00:09:20,341
to talk to the community through patch notes alone.

167
00:09:21,041 --> 00:09:23,562
So if we wanted to say something to our players,

168
00:09:23,982 --> 00:09:25,483
we had to put something in a build.

169
00:09:25,503 --> 00:09:27,603
And we had to ship that build, and then we

170
00:09:27,643 --> 00:09:28,724
had to tell people about it.

171
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,585
And there's something really pure and simple about that.

172
00:09:31,925 --> 00:09:33,626
And it informs the way we develop.

173
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,866
It will inform the way we develop going forward.

174
00:09:36,346 --> 00:09:37,987
It's what we got into games to do.

175
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:42,483
It allowed me to do something that I've always done in difficult times,

176
00:09:42,823 --> 00:09:45,526
whether it's crappy bosses that I've dealt with before

177
00:09:45,706 --> 00:09:48,689
or crappy situations at school growing up.

178
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:51,612
I got my head down, I sat in front of a computer,

179
00:09:51,953 --> 00:09:53,975
and I made games, which is what I enjoy.

180
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:01,962
There's this thing I've said to the team a few times,

181
00:10:02,043 --> 00:10:04,325
and it's something I've heard elsewhere,

182
00:10:04,345 --> 00:10:08,288
which is find your metric for success and optimize for that.

183
00:10:08,929 --> 00:10:09,509
And I love this.

184
00:10:09,529 --> 00:10:11,751
I'm a programmer, so we're saying words

185
00:10:11,771 --> 00:10:13,272
like metric and optimization.

186
00:10:13,313 --> 00:10:15,414
And that is right up my street.

187
00:10:15,555 --> 00:10:16,635
It speaks my language.

188
00:10:17,096 --> 00:10:21,220
Sounds cold and clinical, but I find a lot of meaning in it.

189
00:10:22,708 --> 00:10:24,470
Perhaps you want critical success.

190
00:10:24,530 --> 00:10:27,032
Perhaps you want the highest number of concurrencies.

191
00:10:27,232 --> 00:10:29,013
Whatever it is, find your metric.

192
00:10:29,354 --> 00:10:31,075
And every day as a team, you are faced

193
00:10:31,135 --> 00:10:33,016
with hundreds of decisions.

194
00:10:33,677 --> 00:10:35,378
And everything becomes so much simpler

195
00:10:36,479 --> 00:10:39,001
when you relate that back to your metric

196
00:10:40,402 --> 00:10:43,244
and make decisions optimized for that.

197
00:10:45,646 --> 00:10:48,348
But remember that comparison can be the thief of joy.

198
00:10:49,597 --> 00:10:54,901
When you release a game, it is so easy to fixate on how another game is achieving your

199
00:10:54,981 --> 00:10:56,642
metric better than you are or whatever.

200
00:10:57,003 --> 00:10:57,803
It doesn't matter.

201
00:10:59,064 --> 00:11:01,146
Focus on you and your game.

202
00:11:04,474 --> 00:11:06,336
Now, everyone on the team has their own metric.

203
00:11:06,936 --> 00:11:09,378
I said to the team, this is something that we should do.

204
00:11:09,458 --> 00:11:11,820
And they kind of joked that I've been

205
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,202
reading too many self-help books or something like that.

206
00:11:14,262 --> 00:11:16,004
But actually, it's been really helpful for us.

207
00:11:16,785 --> 00:11:19,607
For me, it became about enjoying my work.

208
00:11:21,228 --> 00:11:22,870
And how I enjoy my work is seeing

209
00:11:22,990 --> 00:11:24,111
other people enjoying it.

210
00:11:28,595 --> 00:11:30,877
So that actually led me to this question of,

211
00:11:30,997 --> 00:11:32,018
why do I make games?

212
00:11:33,408 --> 00:11:36,470
which is something I just hadn't really thought about before.

213
00:11:37,391 --> 00:11:41,994
But I had the opportunity and a lot of a situation

214
00:11:42,054 --> 00:11:44,776
that meant that maybe I didn't want to do that going forward.

215
00:11:46,297 --> 00:11:47,898
And I'm, like I said, a programmer.

216
00:11:47,958 --> 00:11:50,339
So I only understand human emotions in one way.

217
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:53,261
And that's through the use of numbers and graphs.

218
00:11:54,262 --> 00:11:56,924
So just like any normal person, I

219
00:11:56,964 --> 00:12:00,666
started plotting my contentment on a month-by-month basis.

220
00:12:01,046 --> 00:12:01,747
We've all done that.

221
00:12:03,535 --> 00:12:08,139
So for today, I actually asked a bunch of other friends who are developers to do the same, right?

222
00:12:08,159 --> 00:12:10,741
To draw out their journey as a game developer, right?

223
00:12:12,742 --> 00:12:15,764
And we all largely overlapped, right?

224
00:12:16,955 --> 00:12:19,817
Concept is fun, it's amazing.

225
00:12:19,837 --> 00:12:24,119
And it's followed by a more difficult pre-production,

226
00:12:24,439 --> 00:12:26,059
where you start thinking about, OK,

227
00:12:26,099 --> 00:12:27,540
was that concept such a good idea?

228
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:29,581
And then you kind of climb out of that just in time

229
00:12:29,601 --> 00:12:32,022
for production, when you realize that everything

230
00:12:32,042 --> 00:12:34,843
that you did in pre-production was a terrible idea.

231
00:12:36,524 --> 00:12:37,565
And things are way tougher.

232
00:12:37,605 --> 00:12:39,466
And then you just think, just focus.

233
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:40,707
We'll get this game out.

234
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,448
And when this game out, it'll be amazing.

235
00:12:42,468 --> 00:12:43,969
And won't that be an incredible moment?

236
00:12:44,550 --> 00:12:46,671
And actually, the reality is it's

237
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:48,892
kind of taboo for the majority of developers.

238
00:12:49,633 --> 00:12:50,654
It's a real low point.

239
00:12:52,175 --> 00:12:53,536
It's kind of an anti-climax.

240
00:12:54,736 --> 00:12:57,518
And what I've learned is that every part of game development

241
00:12:57,558 --> 00:12:58,619
is harder than the last.

242
00:12:59,119 --> 00:13:01,101
And I have this question of, why do we do it?

243
00:13:06,058 --> 00:13:09,161
I've thought about this a lot over the last few years, right?

244
00:13:09,962 --> 00:13:12,824
And studies consistently show this graph

245
00:13:14,685 --> 00:13:16,947
of basic human happiness.

246
00:13:18,588 --> 00:13:20,149
It starts out like you expect.

247
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:24,413
Childhood is fun and exciting, obviously.

248
00:13:24,473 --> 00:13:26,534
And then you become a teenager.

249
00:13:27,835 --> 00:13:28,996
Things are a little bit harder.

250
00:13:29,356 --> 00:13:30,958
And then you climb out of that in your 20s.

251
00:13:33,315 --> 00:13:35,937
And you learn to find your feet, and then you have a choice.

252
00:13:36,397 --> 00:13:41,101
If you choose to go forward and have kids statistically,

253
00:13:41,721 --> 00:13:45,845
your average happiness decreases quite a lot.

254
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:49,067
During those toddler years, then those toddlers

255
00:13:49,107 --> 00:13:50,008
become teenagers.

256
00:13:50,789 --> 00:13:51,950
And now you've got the double whammy.

257
00:13:51,970 --> 00:13:53,791
They're going through their low point in the graph,

258
00:13:53,831 --> 00:13:56,133
and you're going through your low point in the graph.

259
00:13:56,353 --> 00:13:58,475
And then the final insult is that they move out.

260
00:13:59,976 --> 00:14:01,297
And you're the saddest you could be.

261
00:14:02,691 --> 00:14:05,592
So that's my talk, making games is terrible, don't have kids.

262
00:14:07,373 --> 00:14:08,234
Thank you for coming.

263
00:14:11,796 --> 00:14:13,277
No, I do have some experience here.

264
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:18,399
I embarked on this crazy, stupid project,

265
00:14:18,439 --> 00:14:21,201
the most ambitious game we could dream up with this tiny team.

266
00:14:21,901 --> 00:14:24,342
But I also helped bring three children

267
00:14:24,402 --> 00:14:26,603
into the world at the same time during those five

268
00:14:26,644 --> 00:14:27,464
years of development.

269
00:14:29,373 --> 00:14:33,436
And I discovered that there's a secret that those studies on happiness

270
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,797
in my little graph doesn't show, right?

271
00:14:36,537 --> 00:14:39,319
Something amazing happens when you zoom in on that graph.

272
00:14:40,019 --> 00:14:43,321
We tend to measure happiness year by year, month to month.

273
00:14:44,901 --> 00:14:48,403
But actually, when you embark on something like this,

274
00:14:49,124 --> 00:14:51,085
as an indie dev, as a parent, or whatever,

275
00:14:51,105 --> 00:14:56,988
you tend to find that day to day, your happiness is changing wildly.

276
00:15:00,632 --> 00:15:07,536
I've come to realize that what you do in that situation is you're trading boring, old, average

277
00:15:07,576 --> 00:15:16,081
happiness for moments of transcendental joy, brief glimpses of what this thing you're making

278
00:15:16,141 --> 00:15:16,681
could become.

279
00:15:18,162 --> 00:15:23,085
And as a developer, over the last few years, I've learned to take a step back and actually

280
00:15:23,445 --> 00:15:25,246
try to enjoy that journey as a whole.

281
00:15:28,065 --> 00:15:31,485
For me, transcendental joy beats average happiness,

282
00:15:31,705 --> 00:15:34,386
even if it's just that you get those glimpses of it.

283
00:15:38,267 --> 00:15:40,347
And while we're here and we're comparing

284
00:15:40,787 --> 00:15:42,908
having kids to making a game, because they're pretty much

285
00:15:42,948 --> 00:15:46,429
the same thing, then it suddenly makes sense to me

286
00:15:46,489 --> 00:15:48,849
why I would feel so kind of rudderless

287
00:15:49,089 --> 00:15:50,229
once my game comes out.

288
00:15:51,830 --> 00:15:53,710
It's my empty nest.

289
00:15:53,750 --> 00:15:55,571
My game's out there doing its own thing,

290
00:15:55,631 --> 00:15:57,151
occasionally calling me, right?

291
00:15:59,736 --> 00:16:01,177
And for me, over the last few years,

292
00:16:01,237 --> 00:16:03,358
I've learned to love tending my garden.

293
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:06,719
No Man's Sky, for me, became the perfect outlet, right?

294
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,401
There's this huge universe filled with players

295
00:16:10,481 --> 00:16:12,382
and somewhere where anything could exist.

296
00:16:13,623 --> 00:16:16,004
And if we look at the biggest games in the world right now,

297
00:16:16,144 --> 00:16:19,566
Warframe, Rainbow Six Siege, Fortnite,

298
00:16:19,846 --> 00:16:23,468
they all kind of had this slightly rocky or lukewarm

299
00:16:23,508 --> 00:16:23,868
launch.

300
00:16:26,309 --> 00:16:29,351
Innovation is in such short supply in the industry.

301
00:16:31,663 --> 00:16:33,604
And we need it so badly.

302
00:16:33,624 --> 00:16:35,205
We need to encourage it.

303
00:16:35,245 --> 00:16:36,285
We need to foster it.

304
00:16:37,306 --> 00:16:39,186
We need to ask people to shoot for the moon.

305
00:16:39,647 --> 00:16:41,967
And if they fail on their first attempt,

306
00:16:42,208 --> 00:16:43,888
we need to be there to support them.

307
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:49,170
We focus far too much as an industry on week one sales,

308
00:16:49,951 --> 00:16:52,332
and so little on long-term impact.

309
00:16:56,183 --> 00:17:02,646
We're all making games in the most polarized and intense moment in gaming.

310
00:17:03,747 --> 00:17:04,667
And it can be scary.

311
00:17:06,408 --> 00:17:09,970
But there's a simplicity I've found in releasing No Man's Sky.

312
00:17:12,192 --> 00:17:15,073
We've started something new now, and I'm loving it.

313
00:17:15,373 --> 00:17:17,454
I'm in that high part of the grasp, right?

314
00:17:17,515 --> 00:17:22,157
But I know that games and making games is never easy.

315
00:17:23,872 --> 00:17:26,976
So if we're going to do it, then let's not do it for anything

316
00:17:26,996 --> 00:17:30,641
that doesn't make an impact, that can't really change things

317
00:17:30,701 --> 00:17:31,682
or push the boundaries.

318
00:17:32,022 --> 00:17:34,025
Let's make sure it's insanely ambitious.

319
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:37,470
And let's make sure that we savor the journey

320
00:17:37,770 --> 00:17:39,112
every single step of the way.

321
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:40,614
Thank you.
