1
00:00:05,610 --> 00:00:07,532
So this is the art of first-person animation.

2
00:00:07,592 --> 00:00:08,633
My name is David Helsby.

3
00:00:08,653 --> 00:00:11,195
I'm a senior animator at Bungie Studios,

4
00:00:11,516 --> 00:00:13,638
and I've been there for about six years.

5
00:00:14,158 --> 00:00:17,902
My game credits at Bungie are Halo Reach and now Destiny

6
00:00:17,962 --> 00:00:19,364
and subsequent DLCs.

7
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:21,306
And yeah.

8
00:00:22,347 --> 00:00:24,769
So I want to start out by asking you a question.

9
00:00:25,690 --> 00:00:28,793
And that is, what makes a Bungie game feel like a Bungie game?

10
00:00:29,822 --> 00:00:32,464
Well, a lot goes into creating the first person experience,

11
00:00:32,544 --> 00:00:34,525
but first person is something that's

12
00:00:34,545 --> 00:00:37,086
going to affect how the game plays and feels

13
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:38,447
on a moment-to-moment basis.

14
00:00:39,127 --> 00:00:43,089
And many of you may not even notice it if it's done right.

15
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,711
So this talk is going to be split up into three parts.

16
00:00:48,311 --> 00:00:50,593
So first we're going to talk about supporting

17
00:00:50,613 --> 00:00:51,993
the goals of sandbox design.

18
00:00:53,552 --> 00:00:57,274
Secondly, we're going to talk about making first-person content that feels good.

19
00:00:57,914 --> 00:00:59,655
And what does feels good mean, really?

20
00:01:00,315 --> 00:01:01,336
I'm going to talk about that later.

21
00:01:02,056 --> 00:01:06,619
And finally, I'm going to talk to you about how to keep from killing yourself in the process of making a game.

22
00:01:07,519 --> 00:01:11,821
And for all of you game developers out there, I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

23
00:01:14,703 --> 00:01:16,084
So, what is first-person animation?

24
00:01:16,873 --> 00:01:22,614
Well, first-person animation is just the animation, it's the movement of your avatar from your

25
00:01:22,854 --> 00:01:25,254
perspective as a player, including the player camera.

26
00:01:25,894 --> 00:01:31,595
So all that motion you see, I mean, some designers have really told me that this is the most

27
00:01:31,635 --> 00:01:36,676
important animation in a first-person shooter, and whether you believe that or not, doing

28
00:01:36,696 --> 00:01:40,597
this content well is something that's definitely going to help the playability of the game,

29
00:01:40,777 --> 00:01:43,297
and more importantly, the replayability of your game.

30
00:01:45,278 --> 00:01:45,398
So.

31
00:01:46,749 --> 00:01:49,650
Let's get started. Supporting the goals of sandbox design.

32
00:01:51,751 --> 00:01:54,912
Now, design and art don't always see eye to eye.

33
00:01:56,292 --> 00:01:58,773
Art wants to make an amazing player attack

34
00:01:59,354 --> 00:02:02,235
that has like three seconds of anticipation,

35
00:02:02,275 --> 00:02:05,676
while design wants an attack that hits one frame after the player hits the button.

36
00:02:06,712 --> 00:02:08,313
Well, to build a new IP of Bungie,

37
00:02:08,333 --> 00:02:10,313
I really needed to know how to best support

38
00:02:10,493 --> 00:02:13,614
the goals of sandbox design and build enough trust

39
00:02:13,654 --> 00:02:16,314
to try and push the artistic side of Destiny's first person

40
00:02:16,354 --> 00:02:17,175
experience forward.

41
00:02:18,055 --> 00:02:19,975
So we came up with a set of design directives

42
00:02:20,035 --> 00:02:22,056
for first person we called Design Pillars.

43
00:02:24,296 --> 00:02:28,677
So this is my first talk that I'm giving at GDC.

44
00:02:28,697 --> 00:02:30,258
And when you're putting a talk like this together,

45
00:02:30,298 --> 00:02:31,738
you want to sound really prepared

46
00:02:31,758 --> 00:02:33,598
and you want to sound like you know what you're doing, right?

47
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:38,041
And so when I, in my first incarnation of this talk,

48
00:02:38,081 --> 00:02:39,222
I was gonna say, yeah, you know,

49
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:40,603
we made these design pillars,

50
00:02:40,703 --> 00:02:43,606
and we made them at the beginning of the project,

51
00:02:43,646 --> 00:02:45,007
and then we just followed that,

52
00:02:45,067 --> 00:02:47,069
and everything went super cool, right?

53
00:02:47,950 --> 00:02:49,571
And I gave this, I gave this kind of a,

54
00:02:49,731 --> 00:02:52,694
this first talk to one of our sandbox director,

55
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,755
and he's like, he's like, what are you doing?

56
00:02:55,596 --> 00:02:56,497
He's like, tell the truth.

57
00:02:58,255 --> 00:02:59,316
And I was like, alright.

58
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:01,958
So the truth is, we came up with these

59
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:06,761
these pillars of first-person design, like, after the project was finished.

60
00:03:07,242 --> 00:03:10,524
I sat down with it, and I'm like, what do we really do here? What's important?

61
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:15,068
He's like, oh, okay, yeah, you know, we did this and this, and I'm like, alright, cool.

62
00:03:15,828 --> 00:03:17,350
Now, for the next game, we'll know.

63
00:03:18,330 --> 00:03:19,952
So, here are our pillars.

64
00:03:20,392 --> 00:03:22,574
And you guys get them for free, you don't have to go through the pain we went through.

65
00:03:24,391 --> 00:03:28,873
The first one is just immediate feedback from the player controller input.

66
00:03:28,973 --> 00:03:31,734
And that just means like you hit a button and you get an action.

67
00:03:32,495 --> 00:03:35,756
And if you think about it, your brain's already told you what you want to do.

68
00:03:35,856 --> 00:03:39,058
So if you hit the button, you don't get an immediate response.

69
00:03:39,298 --> 00:03:43,160
It feels wrong. It feels like there's a disconnect between you and the game.

70
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:47,462
So the minute that button gets pushed,

71
00:03:47,482 --> 00:03:49,723
you want to start seeing motion on the screen, like immediately.

72
00:03:51,229 --> 00:03:53,811
Secondly is the preservation of motion between actions.

73
00:03:53,911 --> 00:03:56,914
It just means everything has to flow smoothly

74
00:03:56,974 --> 00:03:58,195
from one motion to the other.

75
00:03:58,335 --> 00:04:01,478
And we've gotten past the point where we can do a motion,

76
00:04:01,538 --> 00:04:03,459
it comes back to an idle and hits a wall,

77
00:04:03,499 --> 00:04:04,781
and then you do another motion.

78
00:04:04,821 --> 00:04:06,422
You need to be able to design animations

79
00:04:06,442 --> 00:04:07,803
that chain together effectively.

80
00:04:10,547 --> 00:04:15,050
So the third one is the player should have visceral satisfaction from your animation.

81
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:19,492
Now this doesn't mean like, oh, make something cool, make a cool reload.

82
00:04:19,532 --> 00:04:24,055
This means think about the player, think about each thing as a player experience.

83
00:04:24,815 --> 00:04:27,957
And that means like, if I'm going to make like a really cool melee or reload,

84
00:04:27,977 --> 00:04:32,120
I need design and sound and effects all on board,

85
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:35,121
because if we're all not working toward the same goal,

86
00:04:35,582 --> 00:04:38,563
toward the same player experience, it's not going to be as good as it could be.

87
00:04:41,564 --> 00:04:45,268
Four is, motion should serve to ground the player to the world.

88
00:04:45,948 --> 00:04:48,732
Now, first person is really an interactive experience,

89
00:04:48,832 --> 00:04:50,954
or an immersive experience.

90
00:04:50,974 --> 00:04:54,999
So you should really feel like, you should feel physical.

91
00:04:55,019 --> 00:04:56,781
You should feel like there's a body behind the camera.

92
00:04:58,874 --> 00:05:02,756
And finally, this is one that I thought was really interesting and it didn't come on until very late.

93
00:05:02,896 --> 00:05:06,237
At least, my true understanding of it, which is no speed bumps.

94
00:05:06,777 --> 00:05:11,679
And that just means we don't want to take control away from the player or slow him down in the sandbox as much as possible.

95
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:17,682
And like, analogy of that is like, you're, you've got a really fast car. You've been given like a Ferrari.

96
00:05:17,722 --> 00:05:19,463
The last thing you want to do is go for a speed bump.

97
00:05:19,643 --> 00:05:23,985
You want to be on a straightaway. That car is meant to be driven fast, so drive it fast.

98
00:05:25,557 --> 00:05:29,418
So, this is the last time I'm gonna assault you guys with a wall of text. I promise.

99
00:05:30,158 --> 00:05:34,620
So, but I will be mentioning some of these things, you know, as the talk goes on.

100
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,921
But I boiled them down to like two main principles.

101
00:05:38,041 --> 00:05:40,842
And one is support fast, fun, responsive gameplay.

102
00:05:43,143 --> 00:05:48,285
And two, make it feel like a body, your body is behind the camera. Make it feel physical.

103
00:05:49,225 --> 00:05:52,866
Now this is, this is the hard part, because trying to do both of these, both of these

104
00:05:52,906 --> 00:05:54,587
things at the same time can sometimes...

105
00:05:55,594 --> 00:05:58,176
seem impossible, but there's where the challenge and the fun comes in.

106
00:05:59,336 --> 00:05:59,596
Sort of.

107
00:06:02,258 --> 00:06:02,478
So,

108
00:06:03,719 --> 00:06:06,860
let's move on to, now that we've talked about design principles and

109
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,622
what we want to do and how we want to do it, let's talk about

110
00:06:10,302 --> 00:06:12,123
how to make first-person content that feels good.

111
00:06:14,660 --> 00:06:15,901
What does feels good mean?

112
00:06:16,381 --> 00:06:18,362
Well first, I mean we've gotten some information already.

113
00:06:18,963 --> 00:06:22,405
We want to support first person that supports this fast, fun,

114
00:06:22,566 --> 00:06:23,666
and responsive gameplay.

115
00:06:24,287 --> 00:06:25,468
And we want to make it feel like there's

116
00:06:25,488 --> 00:06:27,709
a body behind the camera, something that feels physical.

117
00:06:28,330 --> 00:06:30,531
But like the last thing, the last piece of information

118
00:06:30,632 --> 00:06:34,294
is, don't get in the way of the player's gameplay experience.

119
00:06:34,334 --> 00:06:35,335
Don't get in the way of their fun.

120
00:06:35,635 --> 00:06:39,718
Your content is not more important than the player's fun.

121
00:06:39,998 --> 00:06:41,680
And that's one of the main things

122
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,102
to remember about making first person animation.

123
00:06:46,779 --> 00:06:50,780
So, this is what Destiny looks like without any first-person animation.

124
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:55,141
And this is the same player presets, everything exactly the same,

125
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:57,841
except you're not getting the visual feedback from first-person.

126
00:06:59,542 --> 00:07:03,802
And it feels like you're just kind of a floating camera inhabiting the world.

127
00:07:03,842 --> 00:07:07,483
It doesn't feel like there's any person behind the screen.

128
00:07:08,263 --> 00:07:10,384
So, we want to change that.

129
00:07:10,404 --> 00:07:12,344
We want to start drawing you into our world.

130
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:15,825
So, the first thing we need to do before we even start animating is we need a character.

131
00:07:17,758 --> 00:07:19,799
So let's just look at Bungie's player character.

132
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,962
Our player character is actually two characters in one.

133
00:07:25,002 --> 00:07:27,263
The first one is the third person player,

134
00:07:27,283 --> 00:07:30,465
which you see when your buddies are running around.

135
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:31,805
You see them in the open world.

136
00:07:31,945 --> 00:07:35,647
Or you see yourself when you do like a super animation.

137
00:07:36,768 --> 00:07:38,529
And then we have the first person player, which

138
00:07:38,589 --> 00:07:40,229
is derived from the third person player.

139
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:44,131
And that's just your arms, a player camera, a support

140
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:45,232
object, and a weapon.

141
00:07:46,095 --> 00:07:47,936
And this is the stuff that you're going to actually see

142
00:07:48,996 --> 00:07:50,317
from your player view on your screen.

143
00:07:51,358 --> 00:07:54,139
Well, when we put these together,

144
00:07:55,160 --> 00:07:56,761
you have your actual player character.

145
00:07:57,341 --> 00:08:00,883
So you have your first person arms and rig basically

146
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:03,245
sitting on top of the third person rig.

147
00:08:03,765 --> 00:08:08,448
And we basically make all of the third person geometry

148
00:08:08,608 --> 00:08:11,729
above the waist non-renderable from the first person camera.

149
00:08:12,550 --> 00:08:14,131
And because of that.

150
00:08:15,434 --> 00:08:19,195
If you ever wondered, like, this is what the first person character, what your player character

151
00:08:19,215 --> 00:08:19,935
actually looks like.

152
00:08:20,575 --> 00:08:24,156
That's why you can actually see the feet in a Bungie game, because you're actually viewing

153
00:08:24,256 --> 00:08:25,616
the third person animation set.

154
00:08:28,276 --> 00:08:29,857
So, now we got a character.

155
00:08:31,397 --> 00:08:32,477
But where are we gonna animate it?

156
00:08:32,517 --> 00:08:37,778
Like, we need to understand, like, how to, how to compose art on this kind of canvas,

157
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:41,139
which is your, your screen, your TV, or your monitor.

158
00:08:41,779 --> 00:08:43,639
So let's talk about Bungie's screen space.

159
00:08:46,251 --> 00:08:51,215
So this is a view of Destiny's first-person screen.

160
00:08:51,996 --> 00:08:55,199
And it looks a lot like a lot of first-person

161
00:08:55,219 --> 00:08:55,819
shooters out there.

162
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:02,784
And as you can see, we basically have a really good representation of what's called one-point perspective.

163
00:09:02,804 --> 00:09:09,211
And that's basically these disappearing perspective lines all converging on one point in the screen.

164
00:09:09,391 --> 00:09:13,075
So, and that's, in most first-person shooters, that's like directly in the middle of the screen.

165
00:09:13,496 --> 00:09:17,060
But Bungie does something a little bit different, and we have since Halo 2.

166
00:09:19,421 --> 00:09:23,085
we're actually lowering the reticle and by doing that we're actually giving you

167
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:23,365
this

168
00:09:23,666 --> 00:09:24,046
uh...

169
00:09:26,068 --> 00:09:30,133
like peripheral vision that are vision that you're just kind of wherever in the

170
00:09:30,173 --> 00:09:31,114
peripheral of your vision

171
00:09:31,834 --> 00:09:32,315
that uh...

172
00:09:33,237 --> 00:09:35,358
that actually kind of opens up the world.

173
00:09:35,378 --> 00:09:38,139
It makes the world seem larger and more expansive.

174
00:09:38,159 --> 00:09:41,319
And for me, like, I, like, if I, even if I look out on you guys,

175
00:09:41,359 --> 00:09:44,240
I see, like, this, this box that I can, that I,

176
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:46,701
where I can actually see stuff very clearly.

177
00:09:46,741 --> 00:09:48,902
But then there's all this other information, like, on the top

178
00:09:49,502 --> 00:09:51,002
and on the sides that I'm aware of,

179
00:09:51,062 --> 00:09:53,323
but, but is not perfectly clear in my vision.

180
00:09:53,563 --> 00:09:55,843
So, this actually makes it, I mean, for me, this,

181
00:09:56,144 --> 00:09:59,444
this makes it feel like it's a little bit more of an immersive, um,

182
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:04,255
a real life view of how you would be viewing a world.

183
00:10:07,779 --> 00:10:13,966
So, we have our screen space and we kind of know what it is and how to pose it on there.

184
00:10:13,986 --> 00:10:15,909
So let's put a gun on there.

185
00:10:16,429 --> 00:10:18,111
And basically like...

186
00:10:20,292 --> 00:10:24,535
We'll go back to that one-point perspective again, and this may seem like a very rudimentary

187
00:10:24,575 --> 00:10:31,079
thing to suggest, but taking a little extra time to actually pay attention to that one-point

188
00:10:31,119 --> 00:10:36,462
perspective and find those disappearing lines and actually line up every single line on

189
00:10:36,482 --> 00:10:36,942
your weapon.

190
00:10:37,663 --> 00:10:41,086
or first-person character, so they converge toward that one-point perspective,

191
00:10:41,726 --> 00:10:45,930
it makes it actually feel like, even though these two things are different,

192
00:10:45,950 --> 00:10:50,173
like you have this world that's being rendered, and then you have this character that you're looking at,

193
00:10:50,954 --> 00:10:55,097
it makes it feel like it's part of that world, as opposed to just window dressing that's sitting on top.

194
00:10:55,397 --> 00:10:58,740
And by just taking that little extra step, it just makes it...

195
00:10:59,801 --> 00:11:02,583
you're going to actually build a foundation for your first-person animation

196
00:11:02,623 --> 00:11:07,207
that's just going to feel better, more immersive and right.

197
00:11:07,889 --> 00:11:11,650
And I've done a lot of first-person animation where I didn't take this step.

198
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:13,911
And there was always something just kind of missing from it.

199
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:15,152
And this is what it was.

200
00:11:17,333 --> 00:11:19,513
So now we're going to start animating in first-person.

201
00:11:19,613 --> 00:11:21,714
And I thought it'd be interesting to actually show you

202
00:11:22,414 --> 00:11:24,775
what, where, this space that you're actually animating in.

203
00:11:28,537 --> 00:11:31,478
So this is a representation of first-person animation space.

204
00:11:33,418 --> 00:11:34,939
And as you'll see, it's a very small box.

205
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:39,723
It's very distorted by an extreme field of view,

206
00:11:39,823 --> 00:11:42,405
and nothing matters outside of that box.

207
00:11:43,305 --> 00:11:45,006
Now that sounds actually pretty depressing.

208
00:11:45,766 --> 00:11:48,228
But it's actually like, again, where

209
00:11:48,248 --> 00:11:49,469
kind of the challenge comes in.

210
00:11:51,610 --> 00:11:55,432
So now we've got this gun on screen.

211
00:11:56,473 --> 00:11:58,614
We need to start adding something to it

212
00:11:58,634 --> 00:11:59,714
to actually give it some life.

213
00:12:01,676 --> 00:12:04,717
So let's talk about adding animated overlays

214
00:12:04,757 --> 00:12:05,258
to your weapon.

215
00:12:05,983 --> 00:12:07,844
So if we just got the gun on the screen,

216
00:12:08,504 --> 00:12:09,545
this is what it's gonna look like.

217
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,505
These are just base animations.

218
00:12:14,006 --> 00:12:16,407
So it's a little better than having no first person

219
00:12:16,527 --> 00:12:18,788
on there at all, but still it just looks like

220
00:12:18,828 --> 00:12:20,769
a piece of geometry sticking out of your screen.

221
00:12:20,809 --> 00:12:23,730
It's like, it's not giving me any feeling of physicality

222
00:12:23,810 --> 00:12:24,850
or connection to the world.

223
00:12:26,111 --> 00:12:28,131
Well, this is a problem and I really wanted

224
00:12:28,151 --> 00:12:29,472
to solve this for Destiny.

225
00:12:31,681 --> 00:12:34,822
I kind of went looking for like where can I get information from

226
00:12:35,582 --> 00:12:38,063
from our game to actually start plugging back into our

227
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,464
into our first-person animations and

228
00:12:41,344 --> 00:12:42,445
it was really obvious like these

229
00:12:42,885 --> 00:12:45,846
this third-person player was actually giving us all the information we really

230
00:12:45,886 --> 00:12:49,367
needed. It was giving us pitch, it was giving us yaw, it was giving us this

231
00:12:49,908 --> 00:12:51,848
directionality, speed, everything

232
00:12:52,408 --> 00:12:53,969
that I might want to like actually

233
00:12:53,989 --> 00:12:56,390
you know bring into first person to actually give it

234
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,831
that feeling of physicality to drive these overlay animations.

235
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,554
I made these animations, like these look poses,

236
00:13:09,536 --> 00:13:11,317
these jump animation overlays,

237
00:13:15,019 --> 00:13:17,520
and these lands. And I started plugging all these animations

238
00:13:19,681 --> 00:13:21,762
into the first person. And this is what it looks like again,

239
00:13:22,523 --> 00:13:24,484
just base animations only, just kind of the

240
00:13:25,144 --> 00:13:28,326
gun just kind of static, sticking out of screen.

241
00:13:31,708 --> 00:13:35,350
And now, we'll see the base animations with the animated overlays.

242
00:13:37,070 --> 00:13:39,131
Now, it's starting to feel like a little bit more physical.

243
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,612
It's starting to feel reactive, and that's what I want.

244
00:13:41,632 --> 00:13:44,473
I want, like every time you move that controller around,

245
00:13:44,533 --> 00:13:47,254
every time you push that jump button, or land,

246
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,855
I want you to feel like you're actually in the game.

247
00:13:49,875 --> 00:13:52,756
Like it's actually, you're actually behind that camera.

248
00:13:53,276 --> 00:13:54,236
I want it to feel physical.

249
00:13:54,296 --> 00:13:55,336
And now it's starting to get there.

250
00:13:56,137 --> 00:13:57,297
And this, by the way, this...

251
00:13:58,354 --> 00:14:01,076
This sounds simple, but like it's one of those things that

252
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:02,857
it just took forever.

253
00:14:02,917 --> 00:14:06,359
Because it's getting all these animations to all work

254
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:08,181
together, sometimes all at once, and

255
00:14:08,521 --> 00:14:09,502
blending them off and on.

256
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:11,683
It was just like a really painstaking process.

257
00:14:11,723 --> 00:14:15,466
So now we're like half done.

258
00:14:16,146 --> 00:14:19,108
So with like getting the first person character kind of

259
00:14:19,368 --> 00:14:19,929
feeling right.

260
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:23,591
But now like we have to start animating things like actions,

261
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:26,253
like reloads and melees and all that stuff.

262
00:14:26,693 --> 00:14:26,813
So.

263
00:14:28,692 --> 00:14:31,155
Before we start animating, I always think about

264
00:14:33,116 --> 00:14:35,959
what's the most important thing in terms of animation, especially in games.

265
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:39,062
For me, the first thing is posing

266
00:14:39,382 --> 00:14:43,086
before anything else. The poses have to read and they have to

267
00:14:43,126 --> 00:14:46,189
feel right. So I needed information

268
00:14:47,149 --> 00:14:49,512
in that first-person game space as to

269
00:14:49,852 --> 00:14:50,753
how to pose this stuff.

270
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:58,787
We already have some information that we've gotten from the screen space that I talked

271
00:14:58,827 --> 00:14:59,348
about earlier.

272
00:14:59,528 --> 00:15:02,573
We have this peripheral vision, which is this blue bar.

273
00:15:03,514 --> 00:15:04,756
It's on the side and on the top.

274
00:15:05,597 --> 00:15:06,178
And basically...

275
00:15:08,068 --> 00:15:13,512
you don't want to pose or do any of your player actions or interaction in that space.

276
00:15:13,933 --> 00:15:19,537
The reason is, it's a vision that you're aware of, but you're not actually focusing on it.

277
00:15:19,597 --> 00:15:23,300
If there was something right here, I could actually turn to look at it.

278
00:15:23,901 --> 00:15:29,986
But because we're in the first person shooter, you don't have the option to do that.

279
00:15:30,046 --> 00:15:33,589
So you want to make sure that you don't pose things in that area.

280
00:15:34,650 --> 00:15:35,330
The second thing...

281
00:15:36,178 --> 00:15:38,420
which is even more important, is this red strip.

282
00:15:38,460 --> 00:15:40,481
And I'm calling that the combat corridor.

283
00:15:41,021 --> 00:15:44,804
And I call it that because that's where your enemies are

284
00:15:44,824 --> 00:15:47,585
going to be coming from, usually right straight at you.

285
00:15:47,906 --> 00:15:49,407
Or you're going to be coming at them.

286
00:15:49,427 --> 00:15:50,747
You're going to be aiming your gun.

287
00:15:51,748 --> 00:15:55,190
And you want to make sure that you don't block that, really

288
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:59,172
under most circumstances, just because, well, I'll give you

289
00:15:59,232 --> 00:15:59,933
guys an example.

290
00:16:00,313 --> 00:16:03,635
How many times have you been playing a first person shooter?

291
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:05,776
And you're doing pretty well.

292
00:16:06,455 --> 00:16:08,057
You go to reload your gun and

293
00:16:08,738 --> 00:16:10,680
all of a sudden you get killed, like out of nowhere.

294
00:16:11,561 --> 00:16:12,822
Because you didn't see the guy in front of you,

295
00:16:12,862 --> 00:16:14,804
because the reload was actually blocking your view.

296
00:16:14,824 --> 00:16:16,826
Like, I hate that.

297
00:16:17,487 --> 00:16:18,208
Everybody hates that.

298
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:20,029
You're like, you're actually, your content is actually

299
00:16:20,069 --> 00:16:22,092
getting in the way of the player's fun,

300
00:16:22,112 --> 00:16:23,093
or player's experience.

301
00:16:24,094 --> 00:16:24,274
So.

302
00:16:26,196 --> 00:16:28,038
What other information can we get from posing?

303
00:16:30,786 --> 00:16:36,649
Well, something else that I learned is that the eye travels radially around that reticle,

304
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:38,190
like around that aiming reticle.

305
00:16:38,910 --> 00:16:45,734
And that is actually the most important, you know, space on screen, which is to basically

306
00:16:45,794 --> 00:16:48,376
like, it's basically where your eye is always looking.

307
00:16:48,876 --> 00:16:54,139
That little circle right there, you're going to move your camera around, or your player

308
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:56,420
around so you can view things in that particular space.

309
00:16:57,688 --> 00:16:58,530
and in that radius.

310
00:16:58,811 --> 00:17:01,137
So how do you like actually support that radius

311
00:17:01,578 --> 00:17:02,200
with your posing?

312
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:08,803
What can be done really overtly, like I did with this warlock melee.

313
00:17:09,343 --> 00:17:13,347
Like the thumb and the forefinger are actually creating kind of like a frame for this

314
00:17:15,088 --> 00:17:17,150
radius that we're looking around. And in this way, like

315
00:17:18,111 --> 00:17:22,694
not only can you support, not only can you do like cool actions, but within those actions

316
00:17:22,734 --> 00:17:23,815
you can actually frame

317
00:17:24,396 --> 00:17:27,298
like what the player is actually looking at. So you're actually helping them look at this

318
00:17:27,378 --> 00:17:28,659
really important part of the screen.

319
00:17:28,679 --> 00:17:32,362
And this can be done in less overt ways,

320
00:17:33,503 --> 00:17:34,364
like this knife melee.

321
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,002
or even this reload.

322
00:17:38,862 --> 00:17:42,924
And it's just a way of like using your animation to focus the player's attention

323
00:17:43,124 --> 00:17:44,404
to where they already really want to look.

324
00:17:46,145 --> 00:17:48,086
So that's two. I like to do three, so

325
00:17:50,907 --> 00:17:53,888
there's one more that I find is really important.

326
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,689
So in this grenade throw, and in a lot of our actions,

327
00:17:59,470 --> 00:18:01,711
we'll have this moment where

328
00:18:02,271 --> 00:18:05,632
you're actually like holding a part of the body on the screen.

329
00:18:06,569 --> 00:18:11,696
just for a moment. Maybe like, you know, like seven to ten frames or something like that.

330
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:17,204
And this is a grenade throw. So if I was actually throwing something in real life, I would be

331
00:18:17,264 --> 00:18:21,570
like throwing it and I would barely see my arm, like come through my field of vision

332
00:18:21,590 --> 00:18:22,291
and then it would go off.

333
00:18:23,852 --> 00:18:28,775
Because I have this body awareness, my brain has told my body what to do,

334
00:18:29,315 --> 00:18:31,377
and I'm aware of where my arm is all the time,

335
00:18:31,397 --> 00:18:34,119
I don't need to actually see it.

336
00:18:34,519 --> 00:18:39,042
But in first person, really the only information that you have about your character,

337
00:18:39,162 --> 00:18:42,104
this body behind the screen, is the visual information that we're giving.

338
00:18:43,145 --> 00:18:47,330
So we kind of came up with the idea of just kind of like keeping that elbow on screen

339
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:51,835
just for a little bit longer because those poses are what is actually going to read to

340
00:18:51,855 --> 00:18:52,256
the player.

341
00:18:52,436 --> 00:18:56,861
Like, there's only maybe three poses that are three frames of animation where it's actually

342
00:18:56,901 --> 00:18:58,323
going through the screen.

343
00:18:58,903 --> 00:19:02,768
This elbow is actually what's going to read and tell you what you actually just did.

344
00:19:10,075 --> 00:19:14,156
So, it's difficult to, like, continue to talk about animation without

345
00:19:14,716 --> 00:19:19,037
actually going into a real example. So, I want to talk about an animation that

346
00:19:19,437 --> 00:19:23,238
was really hard for me to get right, and one that ended up being really successful

347
00:19:23,278 --> 00:19:28,339
that people ended up liking. So, I want to talk about animating in a knife melee.

348
00:19:29,599 --> 00:19:35,141
So, this was like the knife melee that the hunter class in Destiny could use to

349
00:19:35,621 --> 00:19:36,961
stab people, like, as a melee.

350
00:19:39,591 --> 00:19:40,412
And this is what it looks like.

351
00:19:44,916 --> 00:19:46,698
So, how do we do it?

352
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:50,349
Well, again, let's start with poses.

353
00:19:50,409 --> 00:19:52,930
And right now, let's start with the key poses.

354
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:55,770
And for you non-animators out there, key poses

355
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:58,651
are those main poses or those main pieces of information

356
00:19:58,831 --> 00:20:01,852
in an animation that kind of describes the action.

357
00:20:01,993 --> 00:20:05,374
So I can get pretty much the entire timing of an action

358
00:20:05,394 --> 00:20:08,995
and what that action is going to be by really defining

359
00:20:09,035 --> 00:20:09,695
my key poses.

360
00:20:10,915 --> 00:20:12,056
So where do we start?

361
00:20:14,056 --> 00:20:15,697
Well, this is the idle pose.

362
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,960
And we don't want to start here, because you actually

363
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,501
already have an idle pose on screen.

364
00:20:21,541 --> 00:20:24,723
So you don't need to spend these valuable frames actually

365
00:20:24,763 --> 00:20:25,363
showing it again.

366
00:20:27,264 --> 00:20:29,766
Where I would actually start, where I started with the knife

367
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:32,368
melee, was I started here.

368
00:20:33,469 --> 00:20:37,951
And that pose, that idle pose that I showed you before, that

369
00:20:37,971 --> 00:20:40,573
would actually, in my timeline, probably be on frame

370
00:20:40,813 --> 00:20:42,214
negative two or something like that.

371
00:20:43,532 --> 00:20:45,973
But this is the first frame of, or starting pose of the animation.

372
00:20:45,993 --> 00:20:47,134
There's a lot of information here.

373
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:50,775
So, the first thing I'm doing is I'm pulling this gun off screen.

374
00:20:50,795 --> 00:20:54,336
I want to have that gun completely off screen by the time I, you know,

375
00:20:55,276 --> 00:20:56,257
by the time I've hit something.

376
00:20:57,137 --> 00:21:02,139
And I want to do that because this animation is something that's going to be reused over all weapon sets.

377
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:07,221
And I'll talk to you a little bit more about why we did that later.

378
00:21:08,579 --> 00:21:13,202
The second thing is I'm actually bringing up this knife in a line of action,

379
00:21:13,502 --> 00:21:17,284
like to go to the anticipation of the animation.

380
00:21:21,327 --> 00:21:23,248
So secondly, it's frame three.

381
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:26,310
This is the anticipation pose.

382
00:21:27,450 --> 00:21:28,251
Now, it used to be that...

383
00:21:29,335 --> 00:21:33,097
Bungie games, all melees hit on frame three.

384
00:21:33,237 --> 00:21:34,657
And that's just like, because you can't,

385
00:21:35,398 --> 00:21:37,498
that's how, three frames is what it takes

386
00:21:37,518 --> 00:21:39,359
to really draw a line on screen from like,

387
00:21:39,639 --> 00:21:41,980
to start from, to where you're going.

388
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:44,441
And actually like, it was thought of as like,

389
00:21:44,621 --> 00:21:46,902
that is law at Bungie, like that's what you do.

390
00:21:46,922 --> 00:21:48,743
Like, it's a three frame melee.

391
00:21:49,783 --> 00:21:51,084
But we were able to kind of push this,

392
00:21:51,124 --> 00:21:52,924
and push the physicality of this a little bit more.

393
00:21:52,944 --> 00:21:53,845
It was two frames.

394
00:21:55,187 --> 00:21:58,013
we were actually hitting on frame five. Those two frames, like, actually just gave it a

395
00:21:58,113 --> 00:21:59,697
little bit more, more weight.

396
00:22:02,302 --> 00:22:05,569
So, frame five, that's the hit pose.

397
00:22:06,396 --> 00:22:10,857
So in this frame, we're actually going to hit right at the center of the targeting reticle.

398
00:22:11,377 --> 00:22:14,198
By doing this, I'm actually breaking one of my own rules that I just talked to you about,

399
00:22:14,238 --> 00:22:16,379
which is blocking that combat corridor.

400
00:22:16,859 --> 00:22:20,120
But to really make a melee feel, in first person, really feel effective,

401
00:22:20,160 --> 00:22:24,941
it has to actually hit through that reticle, that contact corridor.

402
00:22:24,961 --> 00:22:28,722
And it actually has to almost stay there just for a little bit,

403
00:22:29,462 --> 00:22:33,103
just to give people the idea that, or the communication that they actually hit there.

404
00:22:38,387 --> 00:22:42,494
Next, you know, the knife mainly has a hit and then it has a pull free.

405
00:22:43,075 --> 00:22:47,302
So that pull free is going to take about five frames including the overshoot and then it's

406
00:22:47,342 --> 00:22:49,185
a moving hold for about seven frames.

407
00:22:49,266 --> 00:22:51,189
And this is where I was talking to you guys about.

408
00:22:52,471 --> 00:22:57,233
those poses that we keep on screen to kind of show you that extra bit of physicality

409
00:22:57,693 --> 00:23:02,895
or that you've actually done something. This is that pose and for me like I feel like this is one

410
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:07,357
of the most important poses in the animation that you're going to do because it's probably

411
00:23:07,377 --> 00:23:13,039
the pose that people are going to most recognize or see when they're doing the action.

412
00:23:16,275 --> 00:23:20,259
And finally, like, frame 25. This is the, this is where it starts transitioning off-screen.

413
00:23:20,739 --> 00:23:25,003
And basically, like, this is a, that, it's a moving hold to off-screen for about seven frames.

414
00:23:26,565 --> 00:23:31,049
And for you animators out here, this is what this animation actually looks like on the timeline.

415
00:23:35,432 --> 00:23:35,633
So.

416
00:23:38,175 --> 00:23:39,856
Let's take a look at that all blocked out.

417
00:23:42,675 --> 00:23:46,936
Now it looks pretty, it doesn't look great right now, but I've actually got all the information

418
00:23:46,956 --> 00:23:51,717
that I need to like start building this into an animation that feels good in gameplay and

419
00:23:51,757 --> 00:23:53,537
also like kind of feels right physically.

420
00:23:58,318 --> 00:24:00,799
So that's, that's the polished version of this animation.

421
00:24:03,859 --> 00:24:05,340
So there's one more piece to this.

422
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:08,200
One more thing that's going to actually kind of...

423
00:24:09,354 --> 00:24:12,956
up your game and kind of make it feel a little bit, make this animation feel a little bit more

424
00:24:13,236 --> 00:24:16,038
physical and a little bit more immersive. And that's, that's the player camera.

425
00:24:17,098 --> 00:24:20,921
And the camera is, is one of those things that can actually be,

426
00:24:21,321 --> 00:24:25,083
can be really cool. It can kind of add that extra bit of physicality or

427
00:24:25,584 --> 00:24:29,086
it can be really destructive to your game. And, like,

428
00:24:29,126 --> 00:24:31,848
I don't know if a lot of you, if a lot of you have played games that

429
00:24:32,648 --> 00:24:37,271
have made you motion sick or, or you're, or you get motion sick, but like.

430
00:24:38,716 --> 00:24:41,698
it's one of the reasons why you really have to be careful with camera animation

431
00:24:41,738 --> 00:24:42,058
because

432
00:24:43,039 --> 00:24:45,981
even if you're like, even if your cam motion is going to make only ten percent of the

433
00:24:46,001 --> 00:24:46,922
population sick

434
00:24:48,143 --> 00:24:50,444
if you're selling a million copies of your game

435
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:53,907
well you've just like, you've just lost a hundred thousand people that

436
00:24:54,307 --> 00:24:57,389
will put your game down, never play it again and probably never play one of your

437
00:24:57,409 --> 00:24:58,190
sequels. So

438
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:01,432
it's definitely something that you have to pay attention to.

439
00:25:02,172 --> 00:25:07,094
Now this next clip I'm going to show you, if you guys have any motion sickness, you might want to look away.

440
00:25:07,154 --> 00:25:15,078
But basically this is just a head-mounted camera, a GoPro on a guy's head, just running straight down a track, running in a straight line.

441
00:25:21,957 --> 00:25:28,103
So this is actually where I started when I was kind of trying to figure out what the camera or what the eyes were doing, what the camera was doing.

442
00:25:28,123 --> 00:25:31,466
And I was like, oh, okay. I'll just animate that.

443
00:25:31,486 --> 00:25:35,910
But, you know, I actually tried, you know.

444
00:25:35,930 --> 00:25:44,397
And I, you know, I had to walk around, like, all the time with this GoPro camera and try and figure out what things look like from a first-person view.

445
00:25:45,258 --> 00:25:45,338
And...

446
00:25:46,297 --> 00:25:50,580
I quickly realized that it wasn't, that's not actually how you see the world.

447
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:52,361
It's not, it's not right.

448
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:57,545
And it's, it's because we have, as, as human beings, an image stabilization system.

449
00:25:57,585 --> 00:26:02,649
Like a lot of you probably know technology with cameras, with these new cameras that

450
00:26:02,669 --> 00:26:03,829
have image stabilization.

451
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,272
Well, we have like a biological version, and that's called the vestibulosystem.

452
00:26:09,814 --> 00:26:14,400
Feel free to correct me, I'm not a doctor, so if I've gotten it wrong you can tell me after the talk.

453
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,504
The vestibular system has two parts.

454
00:26:18,846 --> 00:26:21,109
One is the vestibular-ocular reflex.

455
00:26:22,069 --> 00:26:24,950
Now this is basically a fancy way to say, to basically say like,

456
00:26:25,690 --> 00:26:29,091
if I'm looking at you guys out here, and I turn my head,

457
00:26:29,431 --> 00:26:32,292
my eyes are going to turn in the opposite direction of that turn

458
00:26:32,372 --> 00:26:35,273
to like keep my eyes focused on what I want to look at.

459
00:26:35,893 --> 00:26:38,974
And this happens very fast, like it happens almost immediately,

460
00:26:40,074 --> 00:26:42,595
to like stabilize an image that you're trying to look at.

461
00:26:43,735 --> 00:26:48,157
But your eye actually gets that information from the inner ear.

462
00:26:48,957 --> 00:26:49,077
So...

463
00:26:50,111 --> 00:26:52,934
the inner ear is like kind of an accelerometer. It actually like as you

464
00:26:53,354 --> 00:26:55,576
as you move around and tilt around it actually tells

465
00:26:56,557 --> 00:26:59,400
your eye and your brain like what's actually happening.

466
00:26:59,540 --> 00:27:04,665
So as I move around like it allows my eye to keep up and continue to

467
00:27:04,705 --> 00:27:07,728
look at that thing that's it's interesting to me

468
00:27:07,748 --> 00:27:08,368
that I'm looking at.

469
00:27:09,298 --> 00:27:14,881
And like it can be, it's, if you look at this picture right here of Floyd Mayweather,

470
00:27:15,442 --> 00:27:18,763
he's a really good example. He's doing, especially since we're talking about melees,

471
00:27:19,444 --> 00:27:24,207
like he's punching this guy and he's, it's a really violent action, but his eyes are keeping up

472
00:27:24,447 --> 00:27:29,270
with the turn of his head and body and he's continuing to look at his target, which is exactly where his,

473
00:27:30,490 --> 00:27:36,534
where his glove is hitting. So, like a really simple way of thinking about this stuff is.

474
00:27:37,838 --> 00:27:39,078
balance equals alignment.

475
00:27:39,138 --> 00:27:40,719
And that's like that feeling,

476
00:27:40,739 --> 00:27:43,320
it's basically like the balance of seeing motion

477
00:27:43,500 --> 00:27:44,300
and feeling motion.

478
00:27:44,380 --> 00:27:46,541
If those things are in alignment,

479
00:27:46,581 --> 00:27:49,042
then you're healthy.

480
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:52,563
It feels right and you feel in alignment.

481
00:27:52,763 --> 00:27:58,185
But if you feel emotion and don't see it,

482
00:27:58,686 --> 00:28:00,646
or if you see emotion and don't feel it,

483
00:28:01,367 --> 00:28:02,507
you're gonna get motion sickness.

484
00:28:03,464 --> 00:28:07,827
And a lot of you have probably felt that, like, if you've ever been sitting in the backseat of a car

485
00:28:08,507 --> 00:28:13,030
and you read, you're reading, a lot of you might have felt like that motion sickness.

486
00:28:13,050 --> 00:28:17,373
And that's because your body is feeling the motion of the car, but you're not actually,

487
00:28:17,814 --> 00:28:19,335
you don't have any visual reference of that.

488
00:28:19,375 --> 00:28:23,878
So your eyes and your inner ear are actually out of balance there.

489
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,645
And it's the same, it's the inverse with games.

490
00:28:26,685 --> 00:28:29,627
Like, if you're seeing a lot of motion on screen,

491
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:31,568
but your body's not feeling it,

492
00:28:32,248 --> 00:28:34,089
then it's also gonna cause that motion sickness.

493
00:28:35,470 --> 00:28:39,693
So, a good way to, so, like, what do I do with that?

494
00:28:39,733 --> 00:28:41,033
Like, I know that now.

495
00:28:41,173 --> 00:28:44,575
So I know that a lot of motion on camera

496
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:47,057
or the wrong motion on camera is gonna make me sick.

497
00:28:48,798 --> 00:28:52,180
So I kinda wanted to see, like, what motion was right.

498
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:53,320
So.

499
00:28:54,383 --> 00:29:00,325
If you rotate a camera, and I'm not talking about like if you're rotating your head, but if you actually rotate a camera around, it's going to create

500
00:29:01,046 --> 00:29:05,807
these large motions in the world and on the horizon line and especially on objects far away.

501
00:29:08,388 --> 00:29:19,533
So, and that can, and especially like camera roll in that way can be very disorienting. It's like a lot of motion, especially when you're talking about making motion for the, motion on top, on the, on the player camera

502
00:29:21,234 --> 00:29:22,134
in like an open world.

503
00:29:24,035 --> 00:29:28,598
So, camera translation is actually kind of the opposite.

504
00:29:28,718 --> 00:29:30,619
It creates large motions up close,

505
00:29:31,480 --> 00:29:32,981
and then it kind of trails off

506
00:29:33,041 --> 00:29:34,662
as it goes off into the distance.

507
00:29:35,362 --> 00:29:39,845
So, if you're looking at something up close,

508
00:29:39,865 --> 00:29:43,407
like a player or an NPC or a combatant, or just anything,

509
00:29:44,168 --> 00:29:45,428
you're gonna see that large motion,

510
00:29:45,448 --> 00:29:46,429
but then in the world,

511
00:29:46,469 --> 00:29:48,330
it's gonna kind of trail off after a little bit,

512
00:29:49,050 --> 00:29:49,631
or it seems to.

513
00:29:50,711 --> 00:29:52,613
So, I kind of decided that,

514
00:29:53,449 --> 00:29:56,332
in making camera animation for these melees,

515
00:29:56,932 --> 00:29:59,775
that I wanted to do it with mostly translation.

516
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:07,289
And we did do a little bit of, like, rotation on the camera to kind of mimic what was happening up close

517
00:30:07,329 --> 00:30:11,610
with that translation and kind of, so we could see a little bit of movement in the distance, but then

518
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:18,132
because of some game optimization that we did kind of at the end of the project, like, those small

519
00:30:18,772 --> 00:30:20,312
decimals of numbers got stripped out.

520
00:30:21,132 --> 00:30:23,873
So, wah-wah, you know, next game.

521
00:30:25,453 --> 00:30:25,573
So.

522
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:33,097
So I, I, I know, like, I know I want to use translation, but, like, I want more information

523
00:30:33,117 --> 00:30:39,282
of how to use this translation. So, in most of the, in most actions, in most

524
00:30:39,322 --> 00:30:43,505
violent actions, like, that, you know, that have intent, like, the head leads the action.

525
00:30:44,645 --> 00:30:48,608
And that can actually be seen on the slow motion of this, this boxer hitting this guy.

526
00:30:52,531 --> 00:30:53,892
So if we really slow this down.

527
00:30:55,182 --> 00:30:55,982
This is pretty cool.

528
00:30:56,662 --> 00:30:59,584
When the boxer's setting up, he's actually setting up

529
00:31:00,305 --> 00:31:01,465
with his anticipation.

530
00:31:01,565 --> 00:31:05,928
So as he sets up here, his head's gonna go to the left

531
00:31:05,948 --> 00:31:08,329
and actually anticipate with it.

532
00:31:11,191 --> 00:31:12,471
Then as he starts to throw it,

533
00:31:12,672 --> 00:31:16,454
his head's actually going to lead that action or that hit.

534
00:31:17,054 --> 00:31:17,935
It's gonna lead his arm.

535
00:31:20,568 --> 00:31:26,031
And then as the boxer is about to make contact with his target,

536
00:31:26,852 --> 00:31:28,793
and it's about to cross the center line of his body,

537
00:31:28,813 --> 00:31:31,575
the head actually starts to kind of reverse that direction

538
00:31:31,615 --> 00:31:33,316
and go in the opposite way.

539
00:31:34,997 --> 00:31:38,840
And this is just because his body's trying to keep on balance.

540
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:42,623
And so it's just kind of like his head's moving, then his arm,

541
00:31:42,663 --> 00:31:45,705
and then his head kind of starts to go in the other direction.

542
00:31:47,028 --> 00:31:50,551
And then finally, like, as that head goes in the other direction, it kind of like, boof,

543
00:31:51,352 --> 00:31:56,277
like does a little shake to kind of get back over the center of the body and maintain that

544
00:31:56,317 --> 00:31:57,758
center of mass so he doesn't fall over.

545
00:31:58,739 --> 00:32:03,103
So like, a lot of times, like, this happens really like imperceptibly.

546
00:32:03,203 --> 00:32:06,086
You don't see it unless you look really close.

547
00:32:06,767 --> 00:32:08,168
I had this really cool, um...

548
00:32:09,524 --> 00:32:15,848
a video of Mike Tyson doing this, and it was totally apparent, but it was like VHS quality,

549
00:32:15,888 --> 00:32:17,549
so I didn't figure you guys would want to see that.

550
00:32:22,191 --> 00:32:23,252
So here it is one more time.

551
00:32:26,854 --> 00:32:31,776
So now I'm going to show you the camera path that I kind of created with that same principle

552
00:32:32,297 --> 00:32:33,097
on that knife melee.

553
00:32:37,379 --> 00:32:39,080
So here's the slow motion version of that.

554
00:32:46,951 --> 00:32:54,236
And as you can see, the player camera is going to actually lead the action into that hit

555
00:32:54,936 --> 00:32:56,197
and then lead the action on the pull out.

556
00:33:01,892 --> 00:33:05,255
And it might just be like by one frame, but it really makes a difference.

557
00:33:06,296 --> 00:33:08,838
As you can see there, like basically I'm

558
00:33:08,878 --> 00:33:13,102
creating a grid inside Maya within the first person view.

559
00:33:13,663 --> 00:33:17,146
And I'm doing that because I want to just see what's happening in my first person view

560
00:33:17,186 --> 00:33:19,469
while I do my camera animation.

561
00:33:20,150 --> 00:33:25,337
And secondly, I actually showed you guys the finished animation of the knife melee first.

562
00:33:25,917 --> 00:33:32,605
And that's because I actually want to finish that animation and finish those arcs before I even start getting into the player camera.

563
00:33:34,292 --> 00:33:37,133
That's because I just want to concentrate on one thing at a time and I don't want the player

564
00:33:37,753 --> 00:33:40,134
camera animation to actually be destructive to the

565
00:33:40,715 --> 00:33:43,356
the animation itself. I just do that by basically

566
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:46,317
finishing the animation and then putting all of the

567
00:33:46,998 --> 00:33:49,339
player control flags in camera space. So

568
00:33:50,019 --> 00:33:51,740
as I move that camera around, like

569
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,862
the animation isn't affected.

570
00:33:55,122 --> 00:33:57,003
And then at the very end I can start making slight

571
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,964
like offsets to the camera and the character.

572
00:34:03,576 --> 00:34:08,120
So, from first person, this is what my final camera animation looks like.

573
00:34:08,740 --> 00:34:16,247
And I'm not going crazy with it, it's just enough to make you feel like that head is leading the action and the body,

574
00:34:16,827 --> 00:34:23,292
you feel that physicality of the knife hitting and then getting pulled out, and then that motion trailing off.

575
00:34:26,495 --> 00:34:29,578
So let's see this motion through the development.

576
00:34:36,057 --> 00:34:37,678
And finally, with camera animation.

577
00:34:47,583 --> 00:34:54,247
Alright, so that was like a good representation of kind of how we develop like a motion for first person, like in, for Destiny.

578
00:34:56,027 --> 00:34:57,888
But, like the final piece of this is,

579
00:34:59,269 --> 00:35:01,310
how do you keep from killing yourself in the process?

580
00:35:06,179 --> 00:35:10,942
So why is there a plate of delicious waffles on the screen?

581
00:35:12,063 --> 00:35:14,945
Well, there's actually a story behind this.

582
00:35:15,946 --> 00:35:19,428
When I was working on a previous title, Halo Reach,

583
00:35:19,768 --> 00:35:22,390
I had a producer come to me and say,

584
00:35:22,410 --> 00:35:28,154
yeah, so we've got this beta build at 6 o'clock in the morning that we're cutting, and...

585
00:35:28,715 --> 00:35:31,517
the designers want to change the timing of the grenade throw.

586
00:35:31,537 --> 00:35:35,621
I was like, okay. And he's like, so you need to do that

587
00:35:36,561 --> 00:35:39,244
before this date, before six o'clock in the morning.

588
00:35:39,284 --> 00:35:41,045
And I was like, okay, well it's seven o'clock at night.

589
00:35:42,246 --> 00:35:43,187
I guess I can do that.

590
00:35:44,968 --> 00:35:45,949
But unfortunately, like...

591
00:35:46,966 --> 00:35:48,886
it, it, like, in this game that we're making,

592
00:35:49,827 --> 00:35:52,987
each gun had its own unique grenade throw.

593
00:35:53,487 --> 00:35:55,788
So it was like 22 guns in our,

594
00:35:56,728 --> 00:35:58,008
in this, in this thing, so then,

595
00:35:58,609 --> 00:36:01,509
then there was like three different grenade throws on the third person character.

596
00:36:01,609 --> 00:36:04,670
So, I had to like change like 25 animations,

597
00:36:05,630 --> 00:36:07,871
like before this date, before this, this,

598
00:36:07,991 --> 00:36:10,591
this cutoff time of 6 AM where we're gonna send this beta in.

599
00:36:11,531 --> 00:36:11,692
Like...

600
00:36:12,714 --> 00:36:14,455
for some reason, he said,

601
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:15,575
he said, you know what,

602
00:36:15,955 --> 00:36:17,996
I'm gonna make you a plate of waffles

603
00:36:18,036 --> 00:36:18,976
if you do this for me.

604
00:36:19,497 --> 00:36:20,337
And for some reason,

605
00:36:20,677 --> 00:36:22,078
I thought that was a really good trade off.

606
00:36:24,098 --> 00:36:27,400
But really the point of the whole story is

607
00:36:27,460 --> 00:36:28,560
the waffles are not worth it.

608
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:31,241
The waffles are not worth it.

609
00:36:32,361 --> 00:36:33,962
So this really affected me.

610
00:36:35,569 --> 00:36:38,870
This was a really painful experience, and so I wanted to figure out, as we like move

611
00:36:38,910 --> 00:36:44,332
forward into this, building this new IP, like how I could figure out like not to do this

612
00:36:44,392 --> 00:36:46,793
anymore or not to have this happen to anybody else.

613
00:36:47,133 --> 00:36:50,174
So there was about, there's three really cool things we came up with.

614
00:36:51,955 --> 00:36:54,356
The first one is called an agnostic animation.

615
00:36:54,396 --> 00:36:58,057
This is basically just a non-weapon specific animation.

616
00:36:58,817 --> 00:37:03,679
And these are animations that we shared over all weapon sets.

617
00:37:04,547 --> 00:37:09,370
And so basically the point is we made this animation,

618
00:37:09,630 --> 00:37:12,051
we authored it on the rifle pose,

619
00:37:12,812 --> 00:37:16,314
and then basically put the hand in kind of a neutral pose,

620
00:37:17,074 --> 00:37:21,337
the gun went off screen, you do the grenade throw,

621
00:37:21,537 --> 00:37:24,759
and then we use the ready animation to bring the weapon back up,

622
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:26,980
back so it can fire again.

623
00:37:29,001 --> 00:37:32,303
So just to illustrate that, here's the rocket launcher animation set.

624
00:37:36,043 --> 00:37:37,064
And there was a grenade throw.

625
00:37:37,164 --> 00:37:38,265
It kind of popped a little bit.

626
00:37:38,645 --> 00:37:38,905
Oh, well.

627
00:37:40,266 --> 00:37:44,550
But basically, that grenade throw was used on everything.

628
00:37:44,590 --> 00:37:48,072
It was used for whether you're holding a pistol, a rifle, a

629
00:37:48,293 --> 00:37:51,375
machine gun, or a rocket launcher.

630
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,658
And by doing that, if a designer came to me then, he

631
00:37:54,698 --> 00:37:57,940
said, yeah, I want you to change this animation.

632
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:00,302
And you've got this crazy deadline.

633
00:38:00,322 --> 00:38:00,923
I'm like, sure.

634
00:38:00,943 --> 00:38:02,304
It's one animation.

635
00:38:02,964 --> 00:38:04,786
So instead of 25, which was great.

636
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:15,830
So, this is basically how it looked with the whole thing together.

637
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:18,894
Oh, well, I guess you don't get to see that, sorry.

638
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:22,418
Here it is.

639
00:38:25,996 --> 00:38:28,638
And it actually worked. It blended pretty smoothly.

640
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:30,159
And I actually wasn't sure about that,

641
00:38:30,179 --> 00:38:32,621
because I wanted to actually get that kind of opposing action,

642
00:38:33,202 --> 00:38:34,823
where you would see that throw,

643
00:38:34,883 --> 00:38:37,465
and you would see kind of that pull of the arm.

644
00:38:37,746 --> 00:38:40,028
So I was really concerned that by not doing that,

645
00:38:40,068 --> 00:38:41,769
we would kind of lose a little bit of physicality,

646
00:38:41,829 --> 00:38:44,992
but it worked, and nobody complained.

647
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:48,094
So it didn't get in the way of the player experience.

648
00:38:48,114 --> 00:38:49,295
So it was actually successful.

649
00:38:50,676 --> 00:38:54,319
And it kept me from, you know, from many sleepless nights.

650
00:38:55,903 --> 00:38:57,603
The second one was animation scaling.

651
00:38:58,464 --> 00:39:01,245
Now, a lot of you animators out there, I'm sure,

652
00:39:01,725 --> 00:39:04,646
like, you feel passionate about your work.

653
00:39:04,706 --> 00:39:07,027
Like, you spend a lot of time on an animation.

654
00:39:07,067 --> 00:39:08,568
You want it to be presented well.

655
00:39:09,388 --> 00:39:11,969
Well, like, we didn't have the budget to, like,

656
00:39:12,029 --> 00:39:14,250
just make animations at different speed.

657
00:39:14,390 --> 00:39:16,330
Like, we needed to, like, we needed to, like,

658
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,891
not only, we were not only under a time crunch,

659
00:39:18,911 --> 00:39:20,632
but we just didn't have the memory to make

660
00:39:21,012 --> 00:39:22,333
all these different reloads, so.

661
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:27,101
So I made one reload, and they're like, yeah, we're

662
00:39:27,121 --> 00:39:29,302
going to scale this up to, I don't know, 150%.

663
00:39:29,342 --> 00:39:31,402
I was like, no.

664
00:39:32,322 --> 00:39:34,243
That's my beautiful reload animation.

665
00:39:34,443 --> 00:39:35,483
Don't do it.

666
00:39:35,563 --> 00:39:36,083
Don't touch it.

667
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:37,644
They're like, that'll be fine.

668
00:39:37,664 --> 00:39:40,324
I was like, oh my god, this is going to be terrible.

669
00:39:40,404 --> 00:39:40,944
But you know what?

670
00:39:42,565 --> 00:39:43,405
It was actually fine.

671
00:39:45,565 --> 00:39:47,747
people actually liked it. They liked feeling that

672
00:39:48,308 --> 00:39:49,009
that perk of

673
00:39:49,829 --> 00:39:53,113
seeing an animation that actually, you know, happens a little bit faster. It

674
00:39:53,153 --> 00:39:54,515
actually, like, added to their

675
00:39:55,015 --> 00:39:58,819
visceral and... and visceral experience of the game and something they

676
00:39:58,859 --> 00:39:59,260
enjoyed.

677
00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:00,641
And I mean, let's face it.

678
00:40:01,542 --> 00:40:03,204
A reload animation is a punishment

679
00:40:03,624 --> 00:40:04,726
given to you by a designer.

680
00:40:06,072 --> 00:40:07,933
So you fired your gun too many times.

681
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:10,395
You have to stop and reload this thing

682
00:40:10,535 --> 00:40:12,577
and wait until you can fire again.

683
00:40:12,677 --> 00:40:16,819
So as an animator, your whole job is to basically

684
00:40:17,820 --> 00:40:20,982
make that as seamless and palatable as possible

685
00:40:21,042 --> 00:40:22,583
by making this pretty animation.

686
00:40:22,743 --> 00:40:25,585
Well, the actual act of speeding up that animation

687
00:40:25,605 --> 00:40:27,707
ended up making it something that was even

688
00:40:28,407 --> 00:40:29,488
better and more palatable.

689
00:40:32,029 --> 00:40:37,494
Now this next one is something that may seem boring to you, but it was really exciting for me.

690
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:46,942
So I actually got brought into Bungie because, as a contractor, because the designers tried to, were going to change the FOV of the game.

691
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:59,473
And FOV is short for field of view. So if you have like a high field of view, like, you know, in the 70s or something like that, that means you have a wider aperture that you're actually being able to see the game.

692
00:40:59,914 --> 00:41:04,457
That's good for first-person shooters because you want to be able to see as much as possible

693
00:41:04,577 --> 00:41:07,118
while you're actually, you know, of what's happening around you.

694
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:11,001
A smaller number means a narrower field of view.

695
00:41:11,061 --> 00:41:12,602
So they were adjusting this slightly.

696
00:41:13,342 --> 00:41:18,005
But even a small adjustment to field of view can actually start to affect like...

697
00:41:19,123 --> 00:41:21,725
how, like what's happening with your first-person content.

698
00:41:21,806 --> 00:41:23,227
Like, they changed it a little bit,

699
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:24,868
and you can start seeing inside of meshes,

700
00:41:24,929 --> 00:41:26,630
or things start to, you know, travel,

701
00:41:26,810 --> 00:41:28,072
seem like they're getting smaller,

702
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:29,433
and seem a little bit weaker.

703
00:41:30,334 --> 00:41:31,575
So, they brought me in to,

704
00:41:31,595 --> 00:41:32,476
because they were changing it,

705
00:41:32,516 --> 00:41:33,837
and they, they wanted me to basically

706
00:41:34,137 --> 00:41:35,579
reposition all the animations,

707
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:36,400
so they look good again.

708
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:39,102
Well, I knew that...

709
00:41:40,494 --> 00:41:43,116
if they did that like when we're trying to make this giant

710
00:41:43,497 --> 00:41:46,059
new IP that it would be really painful because

711
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:49,001
their designers are always messing around with stuff

712
00:41:49,822 --> 00:41:51,884
and making artists lives miserable.

713
00:41:52,004 --> 00:41:52,565
No, I'm just kidding.

714
00:41:53,846 --> 00:41:57,869
No, they're, I mean, they need to be able to iterate

715
00:41:57,949 --> 00:42:01,252
and change things as much as we do as artists.

716
00:42:01,292 --> 00:42:03,354
So we did something that was actually pretty cool.

717
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:08,621
So the world camera FOV was 72,

718
00:42:08,661 --> 00:42:11,768
and the designers kind of were changing that back and forth

719
00:42:11,848 --> 00:42:14,193
like through the entire development of Destiny.

720
00:42:16,806 --> 00:42:19,327
But the FP arms and weapon FOV was 77.

721
00:42:20,327 --> 00:42:22,967
And that remained locked from the beginning of the project

722
00:42:22,987 --> 00:42:23,527
until the end.

723
00:42:23,968 --> 00:42:25,448
Because we figured out exactly where

724
00:42:25,488 --> 00:42:28,108
we wanted to frame that weapon and where it looked the best.

725
00:42:28,809 --> 00:42:30,029
And then we didn't want to change that.

726
00:42:30,149 --> 00:42:33,069
So by doing this, by actually splitting up

727
00:42:34,010 --> 00:42:36,930
the FOV between these two elements,

728
00:42:37,730 --> 00:42:38,951
we were able to keep our.

729
00:42:40,995 --> 00:42:43,836
we were able to keep moving forward with what we wanted to do,

730
00:42:43,916 --> 00:42:47,257
as opposed to doing all this busy work of readjusting our content

731
00:42:47,277 --> 00:42:49,957
based on experiments by design.

732
00:42:50,237 --> 00:42:54,518
And also, alternately, design was able to do this without being destructive to our work.

733
00:42:54,598 --> 00:42:58,359
So it was actually an incredible time-saving thing that we did.

734
00:43:01,160 --> 00:43:06,921
So, besides the obvious, what do we get by not killing ourselves?

735
00:43:07,121 --> 00:43:09,862
Obviously, we don't kill ourselves, but we get time.

736
00:43:11,130 --> 00:43:15,855
And as game developers, we're constantly fighting against the clock, trying to make our deadlines.

737
00:43:16,616 --> 00:43:22,542
But as artists, like, what you really need as an artist to make something good is you need time for experimentation.

738
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,896
and iteration. And that's how you make a good product. And that's

739
00:43:26,636 --> 00:43:29,997
that's what artists are really there for. Like that's, and that's how to effectively

740
00:43:30,277 --> 00:43:34,679
use an artist is actually give them time to do this. So if you can actually plan for,

741
00:43:34,939 --> 00:43:38,820
you know, things that are gonna help this within your pre-production and production

742
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,782
process, it's actually gonna help your end product make a, make something that people

743
00:43:43,802 --> 00:43:47,463
are really gonna respond to because the artist has had time to really polish it and make

744
00:43:47,483 --> 00:43:48,383
it as good as possible.

745
00:43:51,224 --> 00:43:51,364
So.

746
00:43:52,558 --> 00:43:54,259
What do we, what do we talk about today?

747
00:43:54,659 --> 00:43:55,620
We talked about a lot of stuff.

748
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:57,362
We talked about design principles.

749
00:43:58,723 --> 00:44:01,024
We talked about the idle and the overlay animations.

750
00:44:01,325 --> 00:44:02,646
Posing in first person.

751
00:44:03,466 --> 00:44:04,607
Talked about animating the knife.

752
00:44:05,348 --> 00:44:05,888
The camera.

753
00:44:07,049 --> 00:44:09,050
And finally, how to keep from killing yourself.

754
00:44:09,091 --> 00:44:09,391
But like,

755
00:44:10,291 --> 00:44:12,673
really the main takeaway from this, this talk is...

756
00:44:13,966 --> 00:44:17,369
that details matter and it's worth waiting to get it right.

757
00:44:17,649 --> 00:44:21,132
This was a quote from Steve Jobs that really resonated with me because

758
00:44:22,073 --> 00:44:26,237
like first-person animation is something that you just see constantly in front of

759
00:44:26,277 --> 00:44:27,398
you all the time and

760
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:32,182
like no matter like what your schedule says like

761
00:44:32,983 --> 00:44:36,086
if you want your game to feel good like it has to, this is one

762
00:44:36,126 --> 00:44:38,187
element you have to spend time on. I would say like

763
00:44:39,308 --> 00:44:40,049
that's a you know

764
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:43,469
lots of different disciplines within games.

765
00:44:44,289 --> 00:44:47,931
Details do matter. It's worth researching. It's worth spending a little time to

766
00:44:48,631 --> 00:44:51,793
experiment and iterate on your content and make it feel as good as possible.

767
00:44:54,374 --> 00:44:55,575
And do we have sound?

768
00:44:57,616 --> 00:44:59,256
And finally, like, this is

769
00:44:59,877 --> 00:45:02,238
this is what we got, like, by kind of, by doing that, by

770
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:04,819
by kind of focusing on those details.

771
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:08,921
No sound.

772
00:45:14,790 --> 00:45:16,250
There's a lot of cool music.

773
00:45:20,131 --> 00:45:20,251
Oh.

774
00:45:29,753 --> 00:45:30,353
Oh, I was too late.

775
00:45:31,494 --> 00:45:32,774
No worries. No worries.

776
00:45:38,295 --> 00:45:40,276
I promise you, it's much better with the music.

777
00:45:47,622 --> 00:45:52,727
So this is a lot of the first person animation that we ended up with in Destiny.

778
00:46:12,516 --> 00:46:13,437
So thank you very much.

779
00:46:13,497 --> 00:46:17,040
I really wanted, I'm thankful you guys came to hear my talk.

780
00:46:17,080 --> 00:46:19,802
I really wanted to give this because, like even for me,

781
00:46:19,862 --> 00:46:22,204
like this stuff really isn't taught anywhere.

782
00:46:22,304 --> 00:46:25,426
And I wanted to like, unless you're like part of a studio

783
00:46:25,446 --> 00:46:27,968
that actually like has a tradition of doing

784
00:46:27,988 --> 00:46:29,669
this type of animation, it's really hard to learn.

785
00:46:29,849 --> 00:46:31,911
So I hope you guys got something out of it.

786
00:46:33,292 --> 00:46:34,733
And I'll take questions now if you guys like.

787
00:46:40,211 --> 00:46:43,794
So you did the melee for the hunter.

788
00:46:43,834 --> 00:46:45,936
Did you also do the throwing knife animation?

789
00:46:45,956 --> 00:46:46,136
Yeah.

790
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:46,536
Yeah.

791
00:46:47,377 --> 00:46:52,101
Can you talk about how you made this thin little projectile

792
00:46:53,322 --> 00:46:54,723
feel like something physical?

793
00:46:54,783 --> 00:46:59,287
Like I throw it, and I feel that thud when it connects.

794
00:47:01,148 --> 00:47:02,289
That's magic, thank you.

795
00:47:02,309 --> 00:47:03,390
Yeah.

796
00:47:03,410 --> 00:47:05,512
Yeah, I can definitely talk about that.

797
00:47:07,092 --> 00:47:10,434
Basically, everything kind of comes from life.

798
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:15,378
So I would spend a lot of time trying to do that motion,

799
00:47:15,438 --> 00:47:17,659
seeing what it would feel like, and also

800
00:47:17,699 --> 00:47:20,401
seeing what it would look like from my vision.

801
00:47:21,943 --> 00:47:23,984
And so I would kind of start there, you know what I mean?

802
00:47:24,004 --> 00:47:26,504
And obviously that timing is something that wouldn't work in game,

803
00:47:26,564 --> 00:47:30,126
but it like gave me some reference to how to actually do it.

804
00:47:31,166 --> 00:47:34,207
And then it was basically like working with the designer to, you know,

805
00:47:34,467 --> 00:47:38,228
define that timing in a way that would actually continue to still feel good to the player.

806
00:47:39,741 --> 00:47:43,687
And finally, like I would actually, I would animate that knife like leaving the hand and

807
00:47:43,747 --> 00:47:45,950
actually like spinning and traveling through space.

808
00:47:46,712 --> 00:47:51,860
And then when, so when I was working with the designer on this, he actually took that

809
00:47:51,920 --> 00:47:53,001
path or that rotation.

810
00:47:53,776 --> 00:47:56,920
And actually the knife itself, as you release it,

811
00:47:57,381 --> 00:47:59,163
that's just a prop object.

812
00:47:59,243 --> 00:48:02,388
So that prop actually, we disappear that prop,

813
00:48:02,808 --> 00:48:05,632
and then that becomes an in-game object that actually,

814
00:48:05,712 --> 00:48:08,336
or a projectile that goes toward the target.

815
00:48:09,851 --> 00:48:14,512
And by just kind of balancing the timing and the posing and physicality of that,

816
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:19,093
with working with the designer to get that to feel as good as possible,

817
00:48:19,273 --> 00:48:20,173
that's kind of how we did it.

818
00:48:20,393 --> 00:48:24,634
And I think it's all about one of those first principles I talked about,

819
00:48:24,874 --> 00:48:30,556
which is to work together with other disciplines to make it feel good.

820
00:48:30,596 --> 00:48:31,576
You know what I mean?

821
00:48:31,656 --> 00:48:32,996
You can't do it in a vacuum.

822
00:48:33,036 --> 00:48:34,777
It has to be a team effort.

823
00:48:35,517 --> 00:48:36,537
So does that answer your question?

824
00:48:38,695 --> 00:48:42,565
the designer applying dynamic positioning for the rotation

825
00:48:43,006 --> 00:48:44,912
to make it feel like it's always going to.

826
00:48:49,724 --> 00:48:56,426
I guess the question is, like, did the designer add any dynamic rotation to the knife to kind of make it feel right?

827
00:48:58,066 --> 00:49:00,847
To be honest, like, I'm not exactly sure.

828
00:49:02,168 --> 00:49:07,210
Like, you know, there are certain points when you just, like, when you work together and you,

829
00:49:07,610 --> 00:49:10,911
and then there are certain points where you hand off to somebody with a different skill set

830
00:49:11,191 --> 00:49:13,612
and they kind of push it that extra mile.

831
00:49:13,652 --> 00:49:16,193
So he, that was Danny Bulla, he did a great job.

832
00:49:16,933 --> 00:49:19,022
helping get that one finished.

833
00:49:19,042 --> 00:49:21,373
So, yeah, thank you.

834
00:49:23,227 --> 00:49:25,968
I had a couple of quick questions about the knife melee.

835
00:49:25,988 --> 00:49:29,349
The one you started it, like the first frame was already up and ready.

836
00:49:29,750 --> 00:49:31,430
Where was the knife on the frame before?

837
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:33,931
Is the knife always present on the first person mesh?

838
00:49:34,412 --> 00:49:34,732
On the...

839
00:49:35,252 --> 00:49:39,514
Oh, actually we like spawn that knife like on that first frame.

840
00:49:39,634 --> 00:49:39,854
Really?

841
00:49:40,174 --> 00:49:42,775
Yeah, and I tried a bunch of different stuff.

842
00:49:42,835 --> 00:49:45,897
Like I tried, I was like, well maybe we can use blending

843
00:49:46,237 --> 00:49:47,978
to make like a smoother transition or...

844
00:49:48,858 --> 00:49:53,159
Or maybe, you know, like I want to start the hand off screen so it would be a little bit more believable.

845
00:49:53,239 --> 00:50:01,302
But what I really found was like, it's such a violent action that like bringing that knife, like popping that knife up on screen,

846
00:50:01,482 --> 00:50:05,824
like it wasn't something that people could read, like visibly.

847
00:50:06,004 --> 00:50:10,845
It's just like, oh, you know, what actually read was the idea of that arc.

848
00:50:11,365 --> 00:50:15,327
Because it's only five frames from the, you know, point of the beginning of the animation to the hit.

849
00:50:15,427 --> 00:50:16,667
So you have like...

850
00:50:17,406 --> 00:50:20,689
an incredibly short amount of time and your eye actually can't usually

851
00:50:21,529 --> 00:50:23,591
track motion that fast so it was just like boom

852
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:26,994
and you know people believed it so it was

853
00:50:27,034 --> 00:50:29,396
good and that took a lot of experimentation I wasn't sure what was

854
00:50:29,416 --> 00:50:29,836
gonna work

855
00:50:31,157 --> 00:50:31,918
the second thing was just

856
00:50:32,338 --> 00:50:35,741
probably real quick uh... that you stabbed and you actually held it for five

857
00:50:35,781 --> 00:50:36,021
frames

858
00:50:37,282 --> 00:50:38,963
I see that there's a big effect hiding

859
00:50:39,404 --> 00:50:40,304
the contact

860
00:50:40,805 --> 00:50:44,228
was there is that all there is or is there is the enemy actually playing a

861
00:50:44,568 --> 00:50:45,629
reaction to anchor them

862
00:50:46,189 --> 00:50:46,710
to that stab

863
00:50:47,256 --> 00:50:54,646
All the enemies play like actual reactions to the stab as well as like effects, you know,

864
00:50:55,507 --> 00:50:59,873
making it feel like it's impactful and like it's adding to that physicality.

865
00:51:00,113 --> 00:51:02,656
But it's not pinned, right? It's not actually like...

866
00:51:03,634 --> 00:51:05,115
No, no, not exactly, no.

867
00:51:05,455 --> 00:51:06,696
And basically like we have like a,

868
00:51:07,076 --> 00:51:08,538
you have a cone of effect, you know,

869
00:51:08,778 --> 00:51:09,658
going away from the character.

870
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:11,780
And I was actually really worried about that one

871
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:14,242
because you're actually hitting this point,

872
00:51:14,282 --> 00:51:17,004
but it actually worked because as you,

873
00:51:17,805 --> 00:51:19,426
because it starts up at the ear right here,

874
00:51:19,686 --> 00:51:22,329
as you come through it like this arm actually kind of

875
00:51:23,269 --> 00:51:24,430
takes up that whole cone.

876
00:51:24,730 --> 00:51:27,813
So when it hits it actually feels, it feels right.

877
00:51:27,853 --> 00:51:30,395
And there's actually some adjustment of the player

878
00:51:30,415 --> 00:51:31,956
where the player will actually kind of suck.

879
00:51:33,327 --> 00:51:39,072
to the combatant a little bit if you're actually on target when you activate the knife melee.

880
00:51:39,392 --> 00:51:39,833
Cool, thanks.

881
00:51:40,073 --> 00:51:40,534
Yeah, thank you.

882
00:51:41,715 --> 00:51:41,895
Hi.

883
00:51:42,335 --> 00:51:42,556
Hi.

884
00:51:42,676 --> 00:51:43,677
So, two questions.

885
00:51:44,097 --> 00:51:49,783
One, in terms of the animation for first person and third person, are those the same animations

886
00:51:50,163 --> 00:51:52,585
or do they go through some adjustments?

887
00:51:53,046 --> 00:51:55,268
And the second question is just scheduling.

888
00:51:55,368 --> 00:51:57,710
So how long did you have per animation?

889
00:51:58,673 --> 00:52:03,215
per animation? Yeah, like the melee, how long did you have to work on that? Oh, okay. A

890
00:52:03,255 --> 00:52:13,261
day, a year? Yeah. The animations on the third person player were like, also like, we thought

891
00:52:13,301 --> 00:52:19,244
of them as chunks, like the first person reload and the third person reload were basically

892
00:52:19,264 --> 00:52:25,168
an assignment handed out to one person. So, like when I got this knife stab, like I was

893
00:52:25,248 --> 00:52:27,029
responsible for the third person knife stab too.

894
00:52:27,809 --> 00:52:30,590
and, uh, like, they're actually separate animations.

895
00:52:31,150 --> 00:52:35,411
So we try to, um, make sure that the timing is exactly the same on those,

896
00:52:35,831 --> 00:52:38,652
on, on usually, like, on those, all those key pose elements.

897
00:52:39,613 --> 00:52:41,233
Um, but they're, but they're separate.

898
00:52:41,593 --> 00:52:43,874
Um, and like, we usually do, like...

899
00:52:47,506 --> 00:52:51,271
I think, like a first person animation takes a little bit longer to do.

900
00:52:51,431 --> 00:52:56,217
Like I would say, you know, that knife stab on the third person character, which was basically

901
00:52:56,277 --> 00:53:02,465
like from the waist up, because it's a replacement animation on top of like a navigation set

902
00:53:02,605 --> 00:53:02,986
or an idle.

903
00:53:03,987 --> 00:53:05,549
That would take maybe like a day.

904
00:53:06,676 --> 00:53:09,977
like a first-person animation like that just to get it right and because

905
00:53:10,857 --> 00:53:13,758
you know you're going back and forth with designers and you're putting it in

906
00:53:13,798 --> 00:53:14,658
play tests like

907
00:53:14,678 --> 00:53:17,839
I would say something like that like all together might take you know

908
00:53:18,159 --> 00:53:18,659
like a week

909
00:53:19,660 --> 00:53:21,560
to get right or even longer you know like

910
00:53:22,080 --> 00:53:24,201
there are times when like those animations just kept

911
00:53:24,901 --> 00:53:26,161
coming back it's like wow

912
00:53:26,181 --> 00:53:27,842
uh... one frame less

913
00:53:28,282 --> 00:53:28,922
one frame more

914
00:53:28,942 --> 00:53:30,303
I was like oh god

915
00:53:31,203 --> 00:53:33,003
so so yeah it's it's kind of

916
00:53:34,714 --> 00:53:39,355
I would say, yeah, it takes a week, but it's really like, who knows?

917
00:53:39,435 --> 00:53:39,956
You know what I mean?

918
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:43,897
It's like, I would say it takes as long as it takes to get right.

919
00:53:45,117 --> 00:53:46,378
And producers don't like to hear that.

920
00:53:47,298 --> 00:53:48,839
But that's kind of the truth.

921
00:53:49,639 --> 00:53:50,960
So thank you.

922
00:53:54,061 --> 00:53:54,241
Hi.

923
00:53:54,781 --> 00:53:56,622
My question is about the FOVs.

924
00:53:57,062 --> 00:53:59,683
I noticed that you used two different FOVs

925
00:53:59,723 --> 00:54:03,144
for the first person weapon hands and world.

926
00:54:04,725 --> 00:54:07,586
My worry is that if you have some animation,

927
00:54:07,626 --> 00:54:11,027
like maybe a little bit longer melee attack animation,

928
00:54:11,407 --> 00:54:12,988
because the enemy and the weapons

929
00:54:13,128 --> 00:54:15,209
are rendered in two different FOVs,

930
00:54:15,889 --> 00:54:18,330
their position on screen might be a bit off.

931
00:54:19,310 --> 00:54:20,871
How do you deal with this problem,

932
00:54:20,991 --> 00:54:23,071
or you feel it doesn't matter at all?

933
00:54:24,332 --> 00:54:29,195
I mean it definitely does matter and there is that problem.

934
00:54:29,976 --> 00:54:37,881
We were able to kind of, I think when designers brought it down to 72, the world FOV, we were

935
00:54:37,901 --> 00:54:43,684
definitely looking at how that FOV was affecting the combatants and other players.

936
00:54:43,864 --> 00:54:48,868
When you actually were to see melees or up close attacks, how that would actually affect

937
00:54:48,908 --> 00:54:49,408
the combat.

938
00:54:50,008 --> 00:54:50,969
And I feel like they kind of...

939
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,973
they hit that threshold of like, okay, we can't go anymore,

940
00:54:54,993 --> 00:54:57,636
otherwise it's gonna start to break down.

941
00:54:57,857 --> 00:54:59,899
So it was basically just kind of like,

942
00:55:00,660 --> 00:55:03,803
look at it and see if it was believable,

943
00:55:03,884 --> 00:55:06,547
and then do that.

944
00:55:07,328 --> 00:55:10,692
There wasn't as much science to it as you might think.

945
00:55:10,732 --> 00:55:11,753
It was just like, that looks right.

946
00:55:12,393 --> 00:55:12,894
Okay, cool.

947
00:55:13,495 --> 00:55:13,995
Let's move on.

948
00:55:14,435 --> 00:55:16,817
So it's mostly like experimenting

949
00:55:16,917 --> 00:55:18,978
for the just right FOV angle.

950
00:55:19,358 --> 00:55:20,018
Yeah, definitely.

951
00:55:20,338 --> 00:55:22,800
And that's like most of it, is just

952
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,981
kind of seeing what looks right, seeing what feels right,

953
00:55:25,001 --> 00:55:25,961
and then just doing that.

954
00:55:26,482 --> 00:55:26,982
OK, cool.

955
00:55:27,102 --> 00:55:27,382
Thank you.

956
00:55:27,662 --> 00:55:27,923
Thank you.

957
00:55:29,753 --> 00:55:32,154
I had a question to ask about the animation blending stuff.

958
00:55:33,274 --> 00:55:35,275
So in the overlay animations, you

959
00:55:35,295 --> 00:55:37,755
were talking about first person blending animations

960
00:55:37,775 --> 00:55:39,116
for the movement stuff.

961
00:55:39,616 --> 00:55:42,276
So could you describe a little of how easy

962
00:55:42,336 --> 00:55:45,717
it was for you to preview those blends, adjusting them?

963
00:55:46,037 --> 00:55:47,858
Did you have control over them, basically?

964
00:55:48,182 --> 00:55:51,185
Over the, um, the, of those animations and how they blended, or?

965
00:55:51,245 --> 00:55:52,366
Yeah, that kind of stuff.

966
00:55:52,626 --> 00:55:57,191
Um, I mean, I had some control, um, based on, like, kind of some blending numbers that

967
00:55:57,211 --> 00:55:59,413
we were able to apply to specific animations.

968
00:56:00,394 --> 00:56:05,919
Um, but yeah, you know, basically it was kind of like, you know, I, okay, you know, these

969
00:56:05,959 --> 00:56:09,382
two animations don't play well together, so I'll have to blend this one off.

970
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,700
while this one blends on at a certain point.

971
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:14,360
Well, at least you had full control.

972
00:56:14,380 --> 00:56:16,601
Wasn't it like a designer had to do it?

973
00:56:16,781 --> 00:56:17,301
Yeah, yeah.

974
00:56:17,321 --> 00:56:19,701
The designers are basically like, well, you just

975
00:56:19,761 --> 00:56:21,642
make it feel right.

976
00:56:21,962 --> 00:56:26,243
And so I would just sit at my desk constantly

977
00:56:27,263 --> 00:56:31,024
looking at the look screens and looking at the jumps

978
00:56:31,044 --> 00:56:32,944
and be like, OK, that's a little bit off,

979
00:56:33,004 --> 00:56:37,005
or that's not playing well with this particular overlay.

980
00:56:37,065 --> 00:56:39,626
And just make slight adjustments to the animation

981
00:56:39,706 --> 00:56:39,986
or that.

982
00:56:40,726 --> 00:56:44,487
or the blend or the ramping on and off of the animations.

983
00:56:45,187 --> 00:56:45,667
Cool, thank you.

984
00:56:45,908 --> 00:56:46,468
Yeah, thank you.

985
00:56:46,488 --> 00:56:49,268
I just have a quick question.

986
00:56:49,548 --> 00:56:52,669
When animating the first person player

987
00:56:53,149 --> 00:56:54,670
inside that camera frustum,

988
00:56:54,830 --> 00:56:57,131
with all the weird perspective and all that going on,

989
00:56:57,151 --> 00:56:59,951
are there any tips or techniques you used

990
00:57:00,411 --> 00:57:02,792
as far as preventing the mesh penetration

991
00:57:02,832 --> 00:57:05,133
and clipping planes and all that kind of stuff?

992
00:57:05,949 --> 00:57:09,792
Yeah, I mean I basically kind of like I mean I use that kind of

993
00:57:11,232 --> 00:57:17,336
combat corridor and peripheral vision thing and basically like I try and stay in those safe zones from from the standpoint of

994
00:57:18,237 --> 00:57:24,240
That point of view and then from like the standpoint of like how the depth of that that area

995
00:57:24,340 --> 00:57:25,801
I just kind of try and keep in mind that

996
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:30,779
when I'm doing an action or putting anything on screen in first person that

997
00:57:31,319 --> 00:57:35,822
the farther away I get an element away from the camera, the smaller it's going to be.

998
00:57:36,123 --> 00:57:41,086
And when you get an element farther away from the camera and it gets smaller, it feels weaker.

999
00:57:42,307 --> 00:57:47,070
And then if it gets closer, in fact when it gets too close, then it starts to feel claustrophobic.

1000
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:49,672
So just trying to like kind of find the...

1001
00:57:51,977 --> 00:57:54,958
find it within their, or find the best kind of depth

1002
00:57:55,698 --> 00:57:56,498
is really important.

1003
00:57:57,819 --> 00:57:59,739
And I'd say like that's,

1004
00:58:00,199 --> 00:58:01,420
that's kind of the guide that I use.

1005
00:58:01,780 --> 00:58:04,740
So you used a combination of kind of exaggerated poses

1006
00:58:04,820 --> 00:58:07,221
and kind of more close poses in order to kind of

1007
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,542
tweak the scale of the objects with the animation?

1008
00:58:10,022 --> 00:58:11,542
Yeah, I mean, and it's not like.

1009
00:58:12,660 --> 00:58:14,524
me like saying, oh yeah, you know, you should do it this way.

1010
00:58:14,544 --> 00:58:16,187
And in fact, all this stuff, it's like,

1011
00:58:16,568 --> 00:58:20,517
this is like, this is what I tried and what seemed to work,

1012
00:58:20,537 --> 00:58:22,641
you know, and even like the camera rotation,

1013
00:58:22,701 --> 00:58:23,263
it's like, well.

1014
00:58:24,098 --> 00:58:27,501
yeah, just be aware of like what that does and not saying not to do it.

1015
00:58:27,882 --> 00:58:31,085
But yeah, it's just, it's basically just kind of experimentation and

1016
00:58:31,305 --> 00:58:34,448
first-person, you know, if you interview first-person animators, they're still

1017
00:58:34,748 --> 00:58:39,092
left out there. It's, I mean, you know it's just all kind of about feel.

1018
00:58:39,292 --> 00:58:42,175
Like you, you put something in there, you experiment with it and

1019
00:58:43,036 --> 00:58:45,779
sometimes it feels right and sometimes it feels right in Maya.

1020
00:58:46,919 --> 00:58:51,164
or in your in 3D Studio Max and then you get it in game and it just completely falls apart

1021
00:58:51,224 --> 00:58:55,628
and I'm not even sure why sometimes, but that seems to be kind of the way.

1022
00:58:55,848 --> 00:59:01,174
So it's just basically I'd say just develop a workflow that where you're continually getting

1023
00:59:01,214 --> 00:59:03,436
content in game and actually testing it in game.

1024
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:04,297
That's the best way to go.

1025
00:59:04,557 --> 00:59:04,838
Thank you.

1026
00:59:05,118 --> 00:59:05,358
Thank you.

1027
00:59:06,679 --> 00:59:11,161
So that grenade thing kind of sound like a nightmare when you came up on the what's that the green?

1028
00:59:11,241 --> 00:59:16,503
Refactoring all the grenade animation sound like a nightmare. So I was wondering if you could have maybe

1029
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:19,424
Separated the two arms on different tracks

1030
00:59:20,024 --> 00:59:26,026
So you could have just done the throw on different timing and then give that to the designers like as they wanted it and then

1031
00:59:26,686 --> 00:59:30,287
spend more time to get what you actually wanted on the right hand with the weapons?

1032
00:59:30,447 --> 00:59:31,928
Is something like that, do you think it's possible?

1033
00:59:32,268 --> 00:59:35,149
Yeah, in fact, I was actually, like, I really wanted to do that.

1034
00:59:35,189 --> 00:59:37,670
I wanted to, like, actually separate the rig.

1035
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:41,571
So, like, I could do something on the left hand,

1036
00:59:41,651 --> 00:59:43,772
and do something else on the right hand, or, you know,

1037
00:59:43,992 --> 00:59:46,433
and kind of mix and match and put those together.

1038
00:59:46,453 --> 00:59:49,074
That would have, like, saved a lot of time and effort.

1039
00:59:49,134 --> 00:59:52,035
But it also required a lot of engineering work,

1040
00:59:52,775 --> 00:59:54,696
and a lot of work that was outside my department.

1041
00:59:56,676 --> 01:00:03,420
It's just one of those things that we didn't, we just didn't get to, or we didn't get to early enough in the development process to actually make it effective.

1042
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:08,684
But I mean, yeah, it's a brilliant idea and we definitely want to try stuff like that in the future.

1043
01:00:08,884 --> 01:00:13,547
The agnostic idea seemed like a good solution as well. It seemed to be cool to blend those two.

1044
01:00:14,148 --> 01:00:16,910
Yeah, thank you. Like I said, I wasn't sure if it was going to work.

1045
01:00:17,490 --> 01:00:19,011
Yeah, it was great. Thanks.

1046
01:00:19,231 --> 01:00:19,511
Thank you.

1047
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,054
Anyone else?

1048
01:00:25,142 --> 01:00:29,446
Well, thank you very much for coming. I'll be around for a little bit if you guys want to ask me any more questions.

1049
01:00:31,327 --> 01:00:31,568
Thank you.
