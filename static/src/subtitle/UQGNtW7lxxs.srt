1
00:00:05,593 --> 00:00:08,155
Hello everybody, we're going to go ahead and get started.

2
00:00:08,215 --> 00:00:09,757
Thank you all for joining us today.

3
00:00:09,817 --> 00:00:11,959
We have a bunch of amazing speakers here with us.

4
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:14,922
So first a little bit of housekeeping,

5
00:00:15,002 --> 00:00:17,745
please silence your cell phones, noise makers, whatevs.

6
00:00:19,767 --> 00:00:21,388
And at the end of the session, please

7
00:00:21,469 --> 00:00:24,892
make sure to fill out your speaker evaluation.

8
00:00:25,012 --> 00:00:26,994
Sorry, this is the third talk I've had this week,

9
00:00:27,014 --> 00:00:28,115
so I'm running a little.

10
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,600
Little off.

11
00:00:31,520 --> 00:00:32,741
So first up, this is me.

12
00:00:32,801 --> 00:00:33,801
I'm Tara J. Brannigan.

13
00:00:33,941 --> 00:00:35,562
I'm the community lead at 5CA.

14
00:00:35,662 --> 00:00:37,582
We're a customer support outsourcer in the Netherlands.

15
00:00:37,602 --> 00:00:41,264
Press the button.

16
00:00:41,384 --> 00:00:41,644
Oh, fuck.

17
00:00:45,085 --> 00:00:45,745
Sorry about that.

18
00:00:47,622 --> 00:00:48,142
Thank you guys.

19
00:00:48,943 --> 00:00:52,084
But yeah, I'm the community lead over at 5CA.

20
00:00:52,605 --> 00:00:53,885
I'm pretty much always on Twitter.

21
00:00:53,905 --> 00:00:54,746
That's my icon.

22
00:00:54,786 --> 00:00:55,586
I'm easy to find.

23
00:00:55,786 --> 00:00:57,687
And I'm also the least interesting person

24
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:58,587
up on stage today.

25
00:01:01,629 --> 00:01:02,669
So why this talk?

26
00:01:03,430 --> 00:01:05,551
There is a certain element of you can't see it,

27
00:01:05,591 --> 00:01:06,231
you can't be it.

28
00:01:06,351 --> 00:01:08,392
So there are a lot of really interesting,

29
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,973
niche, specialized roles within the industry

30
00:01:11,013 --> 00:01:12,194
that I think a lot of people

31
00:01:12,814 --> 00:01:14,675
don't even know are a possibility.

32
00:01:15,636 --> 00:01:19,358
And when I put out the call of, hey, who does something interesting in the game industry,

33
00:01:19,458 --> 00:01:23,761
I came up with so many responses that I just had never even considered myself.

34
00:01:24,442 --> 00:01:27,103
And keep in mind, I've been in the industry about 15 years,

35
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:30,306
so to uncover these new disciplines was just amazing.

36
00:01:31,426 --> 00:01:35,169
And then on a more personal note, I really like getting people into GDC,

37
00:01:35,229 --> 00:01:38,591
so I tried to sneak as many people in as possible that are excellent speakers.

38
00:01:41,094 --> 00:01:46,219
So there's a wide array of amazing speakers up here today.

39
00:01:46,239 --> 00:01:48,121
I would go ahead and introduce them all,

40
00:01:48,161 --> 00:01:49,181
but that would take forever,

41
00:01:49,322 --> 00:01:51,243
and that is literally what this talk is about.

42
00:01:51,864 --> 00:01:54,906
So first up, I'm gonna hand you over to Victoria.

43
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:05,421
Thanks for the lovely intro, Tara.

44
00:02:06,322 --> 00:02:07,502
So my name is Victoria Dorn.

45
00:02:07,883 --> 00:02:11,385
I am a software engineer in the R&D department.

46
00:02:11,865 --> 00:02:14,787
So my portion of the presentation is called

47
00:02:14,807 --> 00:02:16,268
what does R&D even stand for?

48
00:02:16,348 --> 00:02:18,829
Because this was pretty much what I was thinking

49
00:02:18,969 --> 00:02:22,531
when I accepted my internship in R&D about six years ago.

50
00:02:23,597 --> 00:02:24,297
So who am I?

51
00:02:24,657 --> 00:02:26,897
So I'm an audio-focused software engineer

52
00:02:26,977 --> 00:02:28,818
working in research and development.

53
00:02:28,858 --> 00:02:30,078
That's what R&D stands for.

54
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:32,119
I found out later that first day.

55
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,660
So I'm mostly working on spatial audio

56
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:39,561
for VR and non-VR devices.

57
00:02:40,821 --> 00:02:43,162
So I do a lot of developer support

58
00:02:43,422 --> 00:02:45,002
and a lot of other stuff we'll talk about in a minute.

59
00:02:45,462 --> 00:02:47,445
So my career path is kind of interesting.

60
00:02:47,806 --> 00:02:50,549
So I originally went to school for composition

61
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:52,091
and sound design for games.

62
00:02:52,532 --> 00:02:55,856
From there, I started as the audio engineering intern

63
00:02:55,957 --> 00:02:56,918
in research and development.

64
00:02:57,859 --> 00:03:00,563
And after the summer, they actually kept me on,

65
00:03:00,603 --> 00:03:01,784
which was great, because I had student loans

66
00:03:01,825 --> 00:03:02,385
I needed to pay for.

67
00:03:03,951 --> 00:03:08,956
So after working on the audio team, working as an audio engineer for quite a while, I

68
00:03:09,016 --> 00:03:14,421
was seeing all the cool stuff my co-workers were doing via code and in the software development

69
00:03:14,441 --> 00:03:19,226
realm and I thought, well, you know, university was so fun the first time around, let's try

70
00:03:19,246 --> 00:03:21,449
it again, but with, you know, like more math.

71
00:03:21,529 --> 00:03:22,230
Math's fun, right?

72
00:03:22,250 --> 00:03:23,090
We all love math.

73
00:03:23,131 --> 00:03:23,371
Yeah.

74
00:03:23,811 --> 00:03:23,971
Yeah.

75
00:03:24,796 --> 00:03:28,119
Cool, so I finally finished that up about a year ago

76
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,741
and during that time and currently,

77
00:03:30,761 --> 00:03:32,923
I am splitting my time a lot more

78
00:03:32,963 --> 00:03:34,465
between more audio engineering type roles

79
00:03:34,505 --> 00:03:36,086
and actually software engineering type roles,

80
00:03:36,126 --> 00:03:36,827
which is really great.

81
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,450
So before we dig into what I do,

82
00:03:40,530 --> 00:03:41,571
what have I kind of worked on?

83
00:03:41,611 --> 00:03:42,912
I thought it might be interesting to go over

84
00:03:42,952 --> 00:03:44,433
some of these little projects I've worked on.

85
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:46,842
So the first thing I worked on at Sony

86
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:48,503
was the PlayStation VR headset.

87
00:03:48,843 --> 00:03:51,725
So it uses a spatial audio functionality.

88
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:55,748
So during my first summer of working at Sony,

89
00:03:56,368 --> 00:03:59,650
I was giving PSVR demos at E3, so that was pretty cool.

90
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:01,972
I've also worked on the Platinum Wireless headset,

91
00:04:02,312 --> 00:04:04,313
uses similar technology, and then of course,

92
00:04:04,413 --> 00:04:08,075
the PS4 actually has the spatial audio functionality built in

93
00:04:08,195 --> 00:04:10,737
so I work on that thing too, and it's cool.

94
00:04:12,298 --> 00:04:12,438
So.

95
00:04:13,855 --> 00:04:15,416
For this talk, I thought it might be interesting

96
00:04:15,456 --> 00:04:17,218
to talk a bit, just a little bit,

97
00:04:17,338 --> 00:04:19,160
about both working in research and development

98
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:20,702
and also working on spatial audio,

99
00:04:20,722 --> 00:04:22,063
because I think both of those are kind of

100
00:04:23,124 --> 00:04:25,306
not so typical careers, or things that people

101
00:04:25,346 --> 00:04:26,708
might not think of when they first think of,

102
00:04:26,768 --> 00:04:27,749
like, I work in games.

103
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:29,911
So what is research and development?

104
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:33,975
I kind of think it consists of three big tasks,

105
00:04:34,296 --> 00:04:37,899
or big things that people kind of do inside the department.

106
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,302
So first is kind of researching topics,

107
00:04:40,322 --> 00:04:42,824
so researching things that you're interested in

108
00:04:43,064 --> 00:04:44,286
or you have a specialty in,

109
00:04:44,666 --> 00:04:46,908
just seeing where academia is going in certain areas.

110
00:04:47,809 --> 00:04:49,251
After you've figured out some cool stuff,

111
00:04:49,351 --> 00:04:51,533
or maybe you just came up with cool stuff on your own,

112
00:04:51,553 --> 00:04:53,295
it's prototyping those things.

113
00:04:53,695 --> 00:04:56,738
So actually making something real out of these ideas.

114
00:04:57,499 --> 00:05:00,582
And finally, if your ideas actually fit within the flow

115
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:02,183
of your company or your group,

116
00:05:02,544 --> 00:05:04,005
actually developing those into products,

117
00:05:04,285 --> 00:05:06,067
which is awesome and so fun,

118
00:05:06,147 --> 00:05:07,769
and we'll talk a bit more about that in a second.

119
00:05:09,450 --> 00:05:12,053
I thought it could be interesting to also talk about the people that work in R&D.

120
00:05:12,434 --> 00:05:17,540
So when people think of research and development, you might think, oh, only software engineers

121
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:18,781
work in research and development.

122
00:05:19,242 --> 00:05:21,404
So I'll be one of the first examples, maybe.

123
00:05:22,485 --> 00:05:24,067
Like I was not a software engineer.

124
00:05:24,347 --> 00:05:25,288
I was an audio person.

125
00:05:25,789 --> 00:05:29,213
I knew a lot about writing music for games, and I worked in R&D for quite a while.

126
00:05:29,934 --> 00:05:34,777
We also have artists and we also have non-engineering QA folk that work in R&D as well.

127
00:05:34,857 --> 00:05:39,260
So we have a lot of different people with a lot of different specialties, at least in our department.

128
00:05:40,431 --> 00:05:42,212
So some of the cool stuff about working in R&D,

129
00:05:42,332 --> 00:05:44,873
at least my R&D group, we have hackathons twice a year,

130
00:05:44,913 --> 00:05:48,415
which are really fun and really awesome experiences

131
00:05:48,475 --> 00:05:50,816
to get to learn new skill sets

132
00:05:51,057 --> 00:05:53,078
and throw something together in a couple days.

133
00:05:53,738 --> 00:05:54,879
So that's always very fun,

134
00:05:55,059 --> 00:05:56,980
and lots of collaboration in that realm as well.

135
00:05:57,660 --> 00:06:00,202
So in R&D, a lot of people do a lot of different things,

136
00:06:00,642 --> 00:06:02,583
so there's always the opportunity to work with someone

137
00:06:02,623 --> 00:06:04,764
who does something that you know nothing about,

138
00:06:04,804 --> 00:06:06,906
whether it's machine learning or AI

139
00:06:07,626 --> 00:06:09,547
or actual hardware development.

140
00:06:11,410 --> 00:06:12,851
And also science experiments.

141
00:06:12,991 --> 00:06:16,075
So wrapping back around to kind of the three major things

142
00:06:16,115 --> 00:06:18,939
that R&D does, whilst we're prototyping things,

143
00:06:18,979 --> 00:06:20,901
we need to figure out if they make sense to the user.

144
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:22,963
So a lot of the time we get to partake

145
00:06:22,983 --> 00:06:25,566
in the science experiments, which is rather fun, I think.

146
00:06:27,885 --> 00:06:29,146
So what do I do too?

147
00:06:29,206 --> 00:06:31,228
So it's the spatial audio aspect of what I do.

148
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:33,209
So first off, what is spatial audio?

149
00:06:33,269 --> 00:06:35,351
Quick like two second definition is,

150
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:38,734
so it's kind of like taking stereo 7.1

151
00:06:39,434 --> 00:06:40,255
and making it better.

152
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:42,236
So making the sounds come from all around you,

153
00:06:42,917 --> 00:06:44,818
but usually being output via headphones.

154
00:06:45,018 --> 00:06:47,540
So it's like stereo, but like next level.

155
00:06:49,645 --> 00:06:52,706
So in the spatial audio realm at Sony,

156
00:06:52,726 --> 00:06:54,566
I do a lot of things that involve

157
00:06:54,807 --> 00:06:56,147
developer outreach and support.

158
00:06:56,187 --> 00:06:57,868
So figuring out what developers need

159
00:06:58,348 --> 00:06:59,788
for the functionality that we're creating

160
00:06:59,828 --> 00:07:00,869
and trying to implement that.

161
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:02,949
So trying to get them to use our technology

162
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,011
to the best of its ability, really.

163
00:07:08,211 --> 00:07:11,372
So I also do a lot of work with spatial audio verification,

164
00:07:11,392 --> 00:07:13,333
so trying to figure out what we're throwing into,

165
00:07:13,393 --> 00:07:15,214
or what we're placing into our algorithm.

166
00:07:16,674 --> 00:07:18,775
is correct when it's coming out the other side.

167
00:07:18,875 --> 00:07:21,175
So there's a lot of interesting stuff with Audio QA.

168
00:07:21,255 --> 00:07:22,876
If you haven't worked in audio before,

169
00:07:22,896 --> 00:07:25,636
or in software development, or in any other realm,

170
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:27,697
I would encourage you to do so

171
00:07:27,777 --> 00:07:30,018
because it is a rather interesting field

172
00:07:30,178 --> 00:07:32,098
and presents lots of debugging problems.

173
00:07:32,698 --> 00:07:33,999
So there's a lot of different people

174
00:07:34,039 --> 00:07:35,159
that work in the spatial audio.

175
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:41,624
So there are software engineers, DSP engineers, these are the people actually making the algorithms themselves.

176
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:50,372
There's also game audio artists, so the people actually creatively using the functionality that some of the DSP engineers are creating,

177
00:07:50,833 --> 00:07:54,876
and using it to tell bigger, better, more immersive stories in games.

178
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:59,799
So, finally, why should you do what I do?

179
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:02,381
So why would you work in R&D?

180
00:08:02,981 --> 00:08:05,382
So really, the people in R&D, at least in our R&D group,

181
00:08:05,442 --> 00:08:07,383
are creating the tools and frameworks and code

182
00:08:07,803 --> 00:08:09,924
that's really being used by a lot of different games.

183
00:08:09,984 --> 00:08:12,505
In our case, it's all the games on the platform,

184
00:08:12,565 --> 00:08:14,446
for the most part, which is really awesome.

185
00:08:15,575 --> 00:08:17,177
Another thing, as I mentioned earlier,

186
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:18,998
collaboration is really readily available

187
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:19,999
in research and development.

188
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:22,461
There's a lot of people doing a lot of different things.

189
00:08:22,501 --> 00:08:24,122
There's always chance to learn something new,

190
00:08:24,202 --> 00:08:25,363
which I'm really into.

191
00:08:26,064 --> 00:08:29,166
And finally, releasing products is a really feel-good moment

192
00:08:29,266 --> 00:08:31,248
when the PlayStation VR launched

193
00:08:31,268 --> 00:08:33,470
or when the PlayStation VR was announced

194
00:08:33,530 --> 00:08:36,112
and developers were so excited to try to use

195
00:08:36,152 --> 00:08:37,753
what we had been working on for so long.

196
00:08:38,514 --> 00:08:40,515
It creates lots of really good feel-good moments for you.

197
00:08:41,376 --> 00:08:42,557
And finally, spatial audio.

198
00:08:42,617 --> 00:08:44,959
So spatial audio, I think, is a very interesting realm

199
00:08:44,999 --> 00:08:46,340
because it's constantly evolving.

200
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:49,703
There's still academic research, really active academic research

201
00:08:49,743 --> 00:08:51,285
being done in that area.

202
00:08:51,585 --> 00:08:54,908
So lots of new stuff, lots of intriguing things

203
00:08:54,948 --> 00:08:55,689
for you to think about.

204
00:08:56,329 --> 00:08:57,030
And in my.

205
00:08:58,225 --> 00:09:00,766
experience, it's kind of given me the ability

206
00:09:00,847 --> 00:09:03,008
to flex sort of my creative and technical muscles,

207
00:09:03,388 --> 00:09:05,790
so I can take my experience of learning about music

208
00:09:05,830 --> 00:09:08,272
and sound for games and kind of applying that

209
00:09:08,352 --> 00:09:10,633
to sort of the backend, the functionality

210
00:09:10,653 --> 00:09:12,755
of our library sort of on the console itself.

211
00:09:13,175 --> 00:09:14,556
And then finally, little plug,

212
00:09:14,976 --> 00:09:17,118
we need more people interested in game audio.

213
00:09:17,878 --> 00:09:21,260
So if anyone is even remotely interested in it,

214
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,402
I would encourage you to research more into game audio.

215
00:09:24,843 --> 00:09:25,943
And that's a portion of my slide,

216
00:09:25,963 --> 00:09:27,665
I will pass it on along to Jill.

217
00:09:36,046 --> 00:09:37,407
Thank you, Victoria.

218
00:09:37,427 --> 00:09:40,269
And I promise I'm looking into game audio.

219
00:09:41,910 --> 00:09:45,293
So I'm Jill Murray, and I wanted to do this panel

220
00:09:45,353 --> 00:09:47,054
because I know a lot of people feel

221
00:09:47,114 --> 00:09:48,435
like they have to kill themselves

222
00:09:48,495 --> 00:09:51,717
doing all the right things to break into the industry.

223
00:09:52,298 --> 00:09:55,600
And so I'm mostly here to just say, yeah, you could do that,

224
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:57,901
or you could just be a giant weirdo.

225
00:09:59,923 --> 00:10:05,167
I am kind of a narrative, director, game designer sort of person, which is not, you know, an

226
00:10:05,207 --> 00:10:14,173
especially rare niche in games, but the way I work is kind of different, which is kind

227
00:10:14,193 --> 00:10:17,316
of freelance and in both indie and AAA.

228
00:10:21,655 --> 00:10:25,120
I've tried to provide you with relaxing fish slides because it's Friday.

229
00:10:27,443 --> 00:10:33,191
So my journey to game design, just to give you an idea of who I am and how I work, is

230
00:10:33,231 --> 00:10:36,035
I started out in school for theatre production.

231
00:10:37,216 --> 00:10:40,557
And then I kind of ended up accidentally in web development.

232
00:10:41,457 --> 00:10:45,399
And then I published a couple of novels with like Random House.

233
00:10:46,159 --> 00:10:48,941
And then all of that was still somehow unsatisfying.

234
00:10:48,961 --> 00:10:53,803
And I realized that I could do everything maybe that I wanted to do at the same time

235
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,443
if I went into games.

236
00:10:55,823 --> 00:10:58,385
So I transitioned into the industry quite late.

237
00:10:58,525 --> 00:11:00,685
I was 34 when I first got the idea.

238
00:11:06,043 --> 00:11:08,024
So that was a rather big career switch.

239
00:11:09,645 --> 00:11:11,826
My background included lots of relevant things

240
00:11:11,866 --> 00:11:16,048
like visual art, drafting, environment design, coding, UX

241
00:11:16,088 --> 00:11:20,330
and UI, story development, project management, production

242
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:22,451
and business development, and audio production.

243
00:11:23,152 --> 00:11:25,853
But so obviously, I decided I wanted to focus on game design.

244
00:11:31,916 --> 00:11:32,656
It's been eight years.

245
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:35,057
I'm still trying to break into game design, actually.

246
00:11:35,597 --> 00:11:38,237
What I did was focus on my transferable skills,

247
00:11:38,417 --> 00:11:39,318
which were writing.

248
00:11:40,198 --> 00:11:42,578
So I transferred into game writing,

249
00:11:42,798 --> 00:11:45,019
and that essentially almost went too well.

250
00:11:45,939 --> 00:11:47,500
I got to work on some really big games

251
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:49,280
like Assassin's Creed and Tomb Raider,

252
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:51,921
won like a Writers Guild Award.

253
00:11:53,981 --> 00:11:58,646
I'm really grateful for all of that, but I know that deep down I'm still just this weird,

254
00:11:58,887 --> 00:12:01,810
tinkering kind of person that needs to have her hands in the engine.

255
00:12:02,671 --> 00:12:05,154
People do not like to let writers touch the engine.

256
00:12:09,799 --> 00:12:11,981
And life is not just work.

257
00:12:13,382 --> 00:12:15,144
The way that I work is important to me.

258
00:12:15,184 --> 00:12:17,486
It's important to me to be able to work diligently,

259
00:12:17,866 --> 00:12:21,349
but at a humane pace that allows time for things

260
00:12:21,449 --> 00:12:24,031
like thinking and time off.

261
00:12:24,832 --> 00:12:27,434
And in my background, when I spent all that time

262
00:12:27,494 --> 00:12:30,236
as a web developer and novelist, I worked for myself.

263
00:12:31,397 --> 00:12:33,859
When I started in games, taking a full-time job

264
00:12:33,879 --> 00:12:36,942
seemed like the best way to learn a lot and make contacts.

265
00:12:38,766 --> 00:12:42,688
After a while, I started to want to go back to the old ways.

266
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:49,831
Oops, I just went back two slides.

267
00:12:59,796 --> 00:12:59,956
So

268
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:09,714
Freelancing. I like it. I have just to offer one caveat which is that I live in

269
00:13:09,754 --> 00:13:17,218
Montreal which is a city with a huge video game industry, Canadian socialized

270
00:13:17,258 --> 00:13:19,860
health care, and extremely low rent.

271
00:13:21,961 --> 00:13:27,306
So I understand that you might not have exactly the same opportunities available to you, but

272
00:13:27,326 --> 00:13:31,950
I would still like to encourage you to take a look around at what your opportunities are

273
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:37,896
within your environment and look for the right fit for you because maybe you have opportunities

274
00:13:37,916 --> 00:13:43,861
that you're not currently aware of because so much of our training is focused on these

275
00:13:43,901 --> 00:13:46,183
like employee career tracks.

276
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:53,236
A lot of people automatically assume that they couldn't handle freelancing.

277
00:13:54,057 --> 00:13:58,961
I think a lot of studios are counting on us feeling this way and planning on taking advantage

278
00:13:59,041 --> 00:13:59,341
of it.

279
00:14:00,302 --> 00:14:01,383
We know what the risks are.

280
00:14:01,443 --> 00:14:02,804
You have to find your own clients.

281
00:14:03,765 --> 00:14:04,805
It can be a lot of work.

282
00:14:05,806 --> 00:14:09,950
Maybe those clients don't pay on time and there's no benefits package.

283
00:14:13,412 --> 00:14:17,075
For me, I think the trick is if you decide to do something like freelancing, you have

284
00:14:17,115 --> 00:14:21,559
to make a conscious decision to be your own best boss.

285
00:14:21,999 --> 00:14:26,143
Think about the kind of person you would like to work for and become that person.

286
00:14:28,341 --> 00:14:31,083
So make sure you set up things like health insurance.

287
00:14:31,423 --> 00:14:33,244
Make sure you're paying into some sort of

288
00:14:33,464 --> 00:14:35,005
retirement savings plan.

289
00:14:35,525 --> 00:14:37,846
Plan for sick days, plan for vacations.

290
00:14:38,687 --> 00:14:41,368
Hire people to do the things that you are bad at

291
00:14:42,189 --> 00:14:45,271
and anticipate crunch and don't get yourself

292
00:14:45,331 --> 00:14:46,551
in a position where you're actually

293
00:14:46,631 --> 00:14:47,912
forcing yourself to do it.

294
00:14:52,158 --> 00:14:53,679
And I think if you do the research

295
00:14:53,919 --> 00:14:56,842
and think it sounds impossible, then maybe, really,

296
00:14:56,862 --> 00:14:58,383
freelancing wouldn't be for you.

297
00:14:58,403 --> 00:15:01,286
But if you look at the numbers and can find a way

298
00:15:01,326 --> 00:15:04,529
to make it work, then maybe you have more opportunities

299
00:15:04,649 --> 00:15:08,012
than you know and more opportunities to be yourself

300
00:15:08,072 --> 00:15:09,953
if you don't fit into a specific box.

301
00:15:10,013 --> 00:15:10,714
And we'd like to do.

302
00:15:12,215 --> 00:15:16,619
you know, games and theater or audio design and art,

303
00:15:17,679 --> 00:15:19,241
this can be a good way to approach it

304
00:15:19,281 --> 00:15:21,102
because you're unlikely to find one employer

305
00:15:21,142 --> 00:15:22,963
who wants all of those things just from you.

306
00:15:25,766 --> 00:15:28,227
So whatever you do, the thing I'd like you to take away

307
00:15:28,287 --> 00:15:31,350
is that your career might not go the way you expected.

308
00:15:32,751 --> 00:15:34,672
You might not wind up with the specialization

309
00:15:34,692 --> 00:15:35,813
you planned at the beginning.

310
00:15:36,494 --> 00:15:39,595
But I think that you find what you love by doing things,

311
00:15:40,175 --> 00:15:43,737
and it could turn out that what you arrive at

312
00:15:43,817 --> 00:15:45,978
is even more satisfying than you could have planned.

313
00:15:46,598 --> 00:15:46,919
Thank you.

314
00:15:49,820 --> 00:15:51,121
And I will turn it over to Angelo now.

315
00:16:01,538 --> 00:16:03,339
Hi, my name is Angelo Alcid.

316
00:16:03,479 --> 00:16:04,059
I am an attorney.

317
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,820
I'm going to put a timer here to make

318
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:08,561
sure I don't talk for an hour, because lawyers like to talk.

319
00:16:09,802 --> 00:16:12,423
Lawyers in the video game industry, it's true.

320
00:16:12,523 --> 00:16:13,263
We do exist.

321
00:16:14,203 --> 00:16:15,244
There are dozens of us.

322
00:16:16,684 --> 00:16:20,826
I realize I came to GDC, and I'm going to talk about law,

323
00:16:20,866 --> 00:16:23,127
but I'm curious, is there anyone else in the room who's

324
00:16:23,167 --> 00:16:23,827
interested in this?

325
00:16:24,767 --> 00:16:25,568
If not, I can just go.

326
00:16:26,268 --> 00:16:27,088
OK, cool.

327
00:16:28,449 --> 00:16:29,209
A little bit about me.

328
00:16:31,408 --> 00:16:32,909
I have an engineering background.

329
00:16:32,929 --> 00:16:35,290
I got my undergrad degree in computer engineering.

330
00:16:35,330 --> 00:16:37,491
I decided I didn't want to be an engineer.

331
00:16:38,292 --> 00:16:40,413
And then I didn't know what I wanted to do when I grew up.

332
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,994
So I did a bunch of other odd jobs

333
00:16:43,114 --> 00:16:44,215
and ended up in law school.

334
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,841
And I didn't know what kind of lawyer I wanted to be either.

335
00:16:48,241 --> 00:16:49,961
And then I realized throughout my whole life,

336
00:16:50,601 --> 00:16:52,562
the one thing I've consistently been doing

337
00:16:52,622 --> 00:16:53,442
is playing video games.

338
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:55,583
So I was wondering if there was a way I could apply

339
00:16:56,443 --> 00:16:57,443
all of the things I've learned

340
00:16:58,343 --> 00:17:00,144
and finally make my parents realize

341
00:17:00,184 --> 00:17:02,084
that those degrees were worth it.

342
00:17:04,565 --> 00:17:06,566
And actually do the thing I loved.

343
00:17:06,806 --> 00:17:09,646
So here I am working in games.

344
00:17:11,249 --> 00:17:14,334
Now, you might be asking, do game devs even need lawyers?

345
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,016
You might have heard this.

346
00:17:16,176 --> 00:17:18,399
It's a common piece of advice.

347
00:17:18,820 --> 00:17:21,524
It's easier to get forgiveness than it is to get permission.

348
00:17:22,545 --> 00:17:24,248
I gave attribution because I'm a lawyer.

349
00:17:25,810 --> 00:17:28,113
You might have heard this, and it's maybe good advice

350
00:17:28,173 --> 00:17:30,296
to kind of show initiative and get out there

351
00:17:30,336 --> 00:17:31,377
and do what you have to do.

352
00:17:31,838 --> 00:17:33,840
A lawyer will never give you this advice.

353
00:17:34,261 --> 00:17:36,824
No good lawyer will ever say, just do it

354
00:17:36,944 --> 00:17:38,987
and then get forgiveness later,

355
00:17:39,428 --> 00:17:42,572
because usually the consequences can be worse.

356
00:17:44,577 --> 00:17:49,258
This is, I took this screenshot from, just as one example,

357
00:17:50,619 --> 00:17:55,000
there was a Kickstarter for a Star Wars fan game.

358
00:17:56,020 --> 00:17:58,421
They were gonna do an engine refresh of,

359
00:17:58,601 --> 00:17:59,881
I think it was Knights of the Old Republic,

360
00:18:00,261 --> 00:18:02,482
which was a great game, and everyone, I'm sure,

361
00:18:02,522 --> 00:18:04,022
would love to see a revamped version of it,

362
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:08,083
but you don't wanna say, we believe so,

363
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:11,024
to the question, is this legal?

364
00:18:11,244 --> 00:18:13,705
You wanna know, like, that's kind of a yes or no question,

365
00:18:13,925 --> 00:18:14,065
right?

366
00:18:16,193 --> 00:18:18,874
And so we exist to tell you yes or no.

367
00:18:19,834 --> 00:18:21,735
And if you go and do it anyway,

368
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,456
Disney might not be so happy.

369
00:18:24,636 --> 00:18:27,517
The mouse is known to send the lawyers after people.

370
00:18:29,298 --> 00:18:31,359
Some other examples of maybe where a lawyer

371
00:18:31,419 --> 00:18:33,360
might have been handy.

372
00:18:34,901 --> 00:18:38,842
I don't know, right in the middle there.

373
00:18:39,503 --> 00:18:40,383
Ragnarok Online.

374
00:18:41,324 --> 00:18:43,725
Everyone has probably at least heard of the GDPR.

375
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:51,183
If for no other reason than you got a ton of privacy policy updates around May of last year.

376
00:18:51,203 --> 00:18:57,131
It's a new privacy law that came into effect right around that time in Europe.

377
00:18:57,792 --> 00:19:01,637
And, you know, there's some steep penalties for failing to comply with it.

378
00:19:02,578 --> 00:19:02,798
But...

379
00:19:03,623 --> 00:19:04,865
It's not so hard, really.

380
00:19:04,925 --> 00:19:05,766
Like, it just makes sense.

381
00:19:05,826 --> 00:19:07,388
It's just a way to protect users.

382
00:19:08,389 --> 00:19:09,831
The people who make Ragnarok Online

383
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:11,193
decided it was not worth it.

384
00:19:11,674 --> 00:19:14,257
So rather than pay someone who knew anything

385
00:19:14,277 --> 00:19:15,819
about privacy law to just come in

386
00:19:15,879 --> 00:19:17,301
and tell them how to comply with this law,

387
00:19:17,602 --> 00:19:20,706
they decided, all right, you can't play our game in Europe.

388
00:19:23,752 --> 00:19:28,833
I mean, which I guess is one solution, but I feel like you could have just paid me or

389
00:19:28,853 --> 00:19:34,115
someone like me a lot less than, you know, I'm sure what you make from users in Europe

390
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:37,336
to just kind of tell you how to operate there legally.

391
00:19:38,636 --> 00:19:39,817
I got another Star Wars fan.

392
00:19:40,517 --> 00:19:41,917
Stop making Star Wars fan games.

393
00:19:43,218 --> 00:19:44,838
I found out about another one this week.

394
00:19:44,938 --> 00:19:49,220
And like, I love Star Wars and I love games, but Disney is going to find out.

395
00:19:52,451 --> 00:19:55,033
These screenshots are from Halo.

396
00:19:55,193 --> 00:19:57,395
You may have noticed, if you'd like little details,

397
00:19:57,455 --> 00:20:00,517
that the health packs changed somewhere along the way.

398
00:20:01,538 --> 00:20:04,240
That's because, actually I think this was Prison Architect

399
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:08,343
got a letter from the International Red Cross people,

400
00:20:08,643 --> 00:20:10,445
and they said, you actually can't use that Red Cross

401
00:20:10,465 --> 00:20:12,266
because that's kind of our thing.

402
00:20:12,806 --> 00:20:14,788
And I know it's kind of ubiquitous in games,

403
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:16,369
like you look at that and you're like,

404
00:20:16,469 --> 00:20:18,250
oh, I'm hurt, I can pick that up and get health.

405
00:20:18,771 --> 00:20:19,912
They actually frowned on that.

406
00:20:20,892 --> 00:20:25,656
So suddenly all of the health packs started changing and now it's just a big H in Halo.

407
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,399
I'm just going running through these, but there was a mobile game for

408
00:20:32,161 --> 00:20:36,944
Westworld that looked a lot like another popular Fallout shelter game.

409
00:20:38,252 --> 00:20:39,513
You may have heard about them getting sued.

410
00:20:40,154 --> 00:20:44,898
And cars, you can't just put any cars you want in a game.

411
00:20:45,959 --> 00:20:47,861
These have to be licensed for a long time.

412
00:20:50,103 --> 00:20:52,065
Like Porsche had an exclusive license with EA.

413
00:20:52,265 --> 00:20:54,547
So if you wanted to make a racing car game

414
00:20:54,587 --> 00:20:55,888
and you put a Porsche in your game,

415
00:20:56,669 --> 00:20:57,670
they would come after you.

416
00:20:57,830 --> 00:20:59,792
So I'm just putting these as examples

417
00:20:59,852 --> 00:21:01,613
of where a lawyer might have been handy.

418
00:21:03,038 --> 00:21:06,244
uh... what do we do i'd like to describe it as i'd like to take care of the

419
00:21:06,284 --> 00:21:08,768
boring stuff so that all the more interesting people here

420
00:21:09,169 --> 00:21:10,091
can do what they do well

421
00:21:11,515 --> 00:21:12,235
and focus on that.

422
00:21:12,596 --> 00:21:15,896
We're either janitors, we come in and clean up the mess after,

423
00:21:16,536 --> 00:21:18,897
or we're policemen and we have to tell you, no, you can't do that.

424
00:21:20,437 --> 00:21:22,758
So there's all kinds of lawyers, all kinds of lawyers.

425
00:21:23,538 --> 00:21:25,558
You could be a solo, you can join a law firm,

426
00:21:25,998 --> 00:21:28,819
or you can work in-house at these video game companies.

427
00:21:28,859 --> 00:21:31,479
I've worked all three of these.

428
00:21:31,519 --> 00:21:35,540
So I've worked at medium, big companies, and just for myself.

429
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:39,882
So there's all kinds of different areas of law.

430
00:21:39,922 --> 00:21:41,923
You don't have to focus on all of them.

431
00:21:43,284 --> 00:21:45,025
I focus primarily on intellectual property,

432
00:21:45,805 --> 00:21:47,786
hence all of the copyright and stuff.

433
00:21:48,266 --> 00:21:51,908
But there's big needs for just general contract drafting,

434
00:21:52,008 --> 00:21:55,590
business law, privacy, like with the GDPR stuff,

435
00:21:56,110 --> 00:21:57,391
tax law, labor law.

436
00:21:57,471 --> 00:22:00,132
If you're a freelancer, you want to know about how to do taxes.

437
00:22:00,192 --> 00:22:02,494
So there's all kinds of opportunities.

438
00:22:02,574 --> 00:22:04,475
So that's my spiel.

439
00:22:07,846 --> 00:22:09,287
And I'll hand it over to Johanna.

440
00:22:15,553 --> 00:22:17,694
Okay, so hello everyone, also from my side.

441
00:22:18,095 --> 00:22:20,417
I just noticed I didn't even put a title on there.

442
00:22:21,578 --> 00:22:26,202
So I'm a professor, so maybe you can also call me the confused professor

443
00:22:26,342 --> 00:22:28,243
or not well prepared professor sometimes.

444
00:22:28,944 --> 00:22:29,685
Might be a fitting.

445
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:32,254
Also, thanks for still bearing with us.

446
00:22:32,334 --> 00:22:34,375
It's Friday at GDC.

447
00:22:34,755 --> 00:22:36,516
I also have my lectures on Friday.

448
00:22:36,576 --> 00:22:37,357
They're not full.

449
00:22:37,577 --> 00:22:38,297
Let's put it that way.

450
00:22:38,998 --> 00:22:40,318
So thanks for still being here.

451
00:22:40,438 --> 00:22:43,820
And I would like to talk a bit what I'm doing.

452
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:47,282
So I'm also a researcher, but I'm a academic researcher.

453
00:22:47,302 --> 00:22:51,464
So basically, way beyond what you guys might be doing.

454
00:22:52,305 --> 00:22:54,466
And I'm a lecturer.

455
00:22:54,486 --> 00:22:57,668
So this means that I try to teach people.

456
00:22:58,068 --> 00:22:59,029
A really, really bold try.

457
00:23:00,395 --> 00:23:03,435
And I'm organizing events. I'm organizing community events.

458
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:07,236
I organize, for example, the biggest Austrian game developers conference and

459
00:23:07,276 --> 00:23:11,177
also a lot of hackathons and game jams. And I really love what I'm doing.

460
00:23:11,677 --> 00:23:15,398
But I want to share with you how I got there because as a researcher

461
00:23:15,738 --> 00:23:18,959
as soon as people would ask me what do you do and I say yeah I'm a professor

462
00:23:18,979 --> 00:23:20,380
yeah they would move away.

463
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:26,341
But it's pretty cool, I'm pretty proud of what I'm doing and I want to share this with you.

464
00:23:26,401 --> 00:23:29,742
But I would like to tell you a little bit of my backstory.

465
00:23:30,102 --> 00:23:31,442
How did I actually get there?

466
00:23:32,022 --> 00:23:37,344
So at the moment I'm a professor at Graz University of Technology, that's in Austria as you might hear.

467
00:23:38,044 --> 00:23:41,745
I did also study sometime in Boston at the MIT.

468
00:23:42,045 --> 00:23:44,966
I did my master thesis there. I have a PhD in computer science.

469
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:51,908
I also used to work at EA. I started there as a QA tester and was credited in a couple of games.

470
00:23:52,668 --> 00:23:59,714
I still do a lot of game user research consulting for studios, big and small studios, just next to what I'm doing now.

471
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:04,177
So it doesn't mean if you focus on one career that you cannot do side careers.

472
00:24:05,818 --> 00:24:13,084
And again, I'm really loving the indie community, so I really try to also push forward the local indie community in Austria and Graz.

473
00:24:14,285 --> 00:24:20,852
But let me start with research. So why do I think research is

474
00:24:21,072 --> 00:24:29,762
really really important. I love doing research because on the one hand I get paid to play games and call it research basically and

475
00:24:30,082 --> 00:24:34,527
It's all about being curious. It's all about trying it trying to find new things

476
00:24:35,017 --> 00:24:38,439
trying to find ideas for the newest technologies.

477
00:24:38,479 --> 00:24:39,379
So that's also pretty cool.

478
00:24:39,419 --> 00:24:41,220
I always get to play, sorry,

479
00:24:41,260 --> 00:24:43,821
work with the newest technologies.

480
00:24:44,021 --> 00:24:47,122
It's all about being some sort of a project manager,

481
00:24:47,162 --> 00:24:49,203
but also idea finder.

482
00:24:49,483 --> 00:24:51,644
So you want to find out what can you do

483
00:24:51,724 --> 00:24:53,845
with the new techniques and the new technologies.

484
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:57,647
It's about thinking and it's about puzzle solving.

485
00:24:58,027 --> 00:24:59,427
So I solve a lot of puzzles,

486
00:24:59,447 --> 00:25:01,568
that's at least how I like to describe it.

487
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:02,549
And

488
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,467
I love to do games user research.

489
00:25:08,629 --> 00:25:12,371
So, for example, if you look at this guy, this guy has fun, right?

490
00:25:12,491 --> 00:25:17,034
Even though this was maybe not designed that way, this guy is still having fun and I want

491
00:25:17,074 --> 00:25:20,997
to find out what is engaging players, what do they find interesting.

492
00:25:21,557 --> 00:25:24,179
And this is maybe not a fun graphic to that.

493
00:25:26,060 --> 00:25:28,481
But basically this is how I look at data.

494
00:25:28,801 --> 00:25:32,823
I do data analysis for that, so a lot of machine learning, statistics, blah.

495
00:25:33,403 --> 00:25:38,226
And I love to look to see what is driving people, what is engaging people.

496
00:25:38,566 --> 00:25:43,288
So in this graph you can see, for example, destiny players and how they play with each

497
00:25:43,388 --> 00:25:46,810
other or against each other and whether or not this is more or less engaging.

498
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:51,158
This is data analysis we did for Just Cause 2,

499
00:25:51,498 --> 00:25:55,420
where we tried to look to see where we are losing players.

500
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:59,082
So if you see the different bars basically,

501
00:26:00,183 --> 00:26:01,483
those represent different levels,

502
00:26:01,523 --> 00:26:03,865
and we are interested in where we lose players.

503
00:26:04,325 --> 00:26:06,506
So we do pretty interesting research here,

504
00:26:06,986 --> 00:26:10,408
and I find it super fun to work with this sort of data,

505
00:26:10,768 --> 00:26:12,829
and be able to say what people like,

506
00:26:12,929 --> 00:26:15,050
or players do like, or what they don't like,

507
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:16,271
and how we can improve games.

508
00:26:18,102 --> 00:26:22,664
And the second part which I find really interesting and important is being a lecturer.

509
00:26:23,244 --> 00:26:28,467
Being a lecturer means being a multiplier. So maybe I'm not credited in all the coolest games

510
00:26:28,547 --> 00:26:35,510
that you might be when you work in the industry and be affiliated with a studio. However, I'm a

511
00:26:35,650 --> 00:26:39,811
multiplier so all of my students will be at some point be part of those studios.

512
00:26:40,132 --> 00:26:42,052
And that's what I find extremely important.

513
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:45,633
What I also, I love, for example, reading.

514
00:26:45,653 --> 00:26:47,153
I love to learn.

515
00:26:47,554 --> 00:26:49,514
And being an educator, being a researcher

516
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,475
also means being a lifelong learner.

517
00:26:51,915 --> 00:26:55,436
So I get paid playing video games to do research.

518
00:26:55,776 --> 00:26:58,136
I get paid reading books to learn.

519
00:27:00,362 --> 00:27:02,143
And never forget the community.

520
00:27:02,664 --> 00:27:05,646
So this is something which you can do as a side project.

521
00:27:05,966 --> 00:27:08,088
I love organizing small events.

522
00:27:08,148 --> 00:27:10,950
I love organizing those game dev days.

523
00:27:11,011 --> 00:27:12,772
I love organizing game jams.

524
00:27:13,212 --> 00:27:14,874
And those are things which you can always

525
00:27:14,954 --> 00:27:19,818
do to learn new skills yourself and try to get maybe out

526
00:27:19,838 --> 00:27:22,060
of your comfort zone and learn all

527
00:27:22,380 --> 00:27:24,242
about the different other aspects you can do.

528
00:27:25,262 --> 00:27:25,543
Thank you.

529
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:38,639
Oh yeah, that's what I called it.

530
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,280
I'm gonna put my timer on as well.

531
00:27:42,861 --> 00:27:43,722
Cool, hello.

532
00:27:43,742 --> 00:27:47,544
This has been around all day, I mean all week.

533
00:27:48,784 --> 00:27:49,705
It'll probably go at one point.

534
00:27:50,565 --> 00:27:51,166
So will my voice.

535
00:27:52,066 --> 00:27:54,587
Hi, I'm Louie.

536
00:27:55,288 --> 00:27:56,048
Here's a slide about me.

537
00:27:59,830 --> 00:28:00,170
Sorry.

538
00:28:00,471 --> 00:28:02,091
I run a bar.

539
00:28:03,372 --> 00:28:04,953
So if you're ever thinking about running a bar,

540
00:28:05,613 --> 00:28:06,073
there you go.

541
00:28:06,134 --> 00:28:06,194
And...

542
00:28:07,693 --> 00:28:14,775
good way to get in the industry. No, I started off in the games. I used to be an environment

543
00:28:14,875 --> 00:28:23,237
and sort of, sorry, level designer in mobile games and I moved back to Australia and started

544
00:28:23,257 --> 00:28:26,598
making games for social spaces. I was always really interested in

545
00:28:28,743 --> 00:28:34,428
uh... again as an artifact in a physical space and what people do to gain some

546
00:28:34,468 --> 00:28:35,709
happy will interact with games

547
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:37,250
you know what people are

548
00:28:37,831 --> 00:28:39,552
drinking while the playing games and uh...

549
00:28:40,533 --> 00:28:45,157
yes so a sudden making hardware so doing a lot of different things uh... and

550
00:28:45,197 --> 00:28:45,777
eventually

551
00:28:45,797 --> 00:28:47,959
by sort of

552
00:28:48,579 --> 00:28:50,001
sudden making events and

553
00:28:50,641 --> 00:28:54,084
putting games and events and eventually had to call myself curator

554
00:28:55,065 --> 00:28:56,106
and which leads on to

555
00:28:57,410 --> 00:28:58,331
Isn't it a bit wanky?

556
00:28:59,131 --> 00:28:59,411
Yes.

557
00:28:59,912 --> 00:29:03,815
It was a long time before I could call myself a curator.

558
00:29:04,896 --> 00:29:09,099
Because it's a term that, yeah, has certain implications.

559
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:13,122
So I never liked to call myself a curator.

560
00:29:14,043 --> 00:29:15,625
And if you talk to curators now, there's

561
00:29:15,645 --> 00:29:18,207
like difference between curators with capital C and lowercase c.

562
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,009
It's all a bit like that.

563
00:29:22,267 --> 00:29:25,910
So basically I just wanted to, I don't believe anyone here should make a bar.

564
00:29:27,151 --> 00:29:30,353
It's, actually no, do it, try it out, it's terrible. You'll love it.

565
00:29:32,335 --> 00:29:33,536
But curation's interesting.

566
00:29:33,976 --> 00:29:39,440
So I'm just going to go through the three kind of main areas of curation.

567
00:29:40,501 --> 00:29:42,743
And hopefully something sparks.

568
00:29:42,763 --> 00:29:46,506
Or, at least you can just think about it when you go on to actually make games.

569
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:50,649
So, archives.

570
00:29:51,626 --> 00:29:54,187
So archiving's probably the most, like,

571
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,327
archiving in museums are kind of the more

572
00:29:57,367 --> 00:29:58,768
like academic-y focused ones.

573
00:30:00,688 --> 00:30:02,709
Archives are more about thinking of games as,

574
00:30:04,349 --> 00:30:07,330
like, artifacts, and it's usually to do with, like,

575
00:30:07,690 --> 00:30:11,351
older games, but it's sort of, like,

576
00:30:11,411 --> 00:30:13,691
you see a lot of people now trying to preserve old games,

577
00:30:13,931 --> 00:30:16,372
or at least sort of make some sort of bank of...

578
00:30:17,323 --> 00:30:18,704
these are things that we need to preserve,

579
00:30:18,744 --> 00:30:22,285
including the technology and how do we even play it nowadays.

580
00:30:24,366 --> 00:30:27,007
But that kind of thinking leads into

581
00:30:27,908 --> 00:30:29,708
what do you record now?

582
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,510
If you're releasing a game, what do you record?

583
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:35,971
Do you record the first, the release,

584
00:30:36,051 --> 00:30:38,552
or do you record after the patches come out,

585
00:30:38,692 --> 00:30:40,993
or do you record the launch party?

586
00:30:41,833 --> 00:30:44,374
There's a lot of things around games.

587
00:30:45,901 --> 00:30:50,184
And archiving those is a huge sort of question.

588
00:30:50,684 --> 00:30:51,965
Actually, all of these are questions.

589
00:30:52,125 --> 00:30:53,366
All of these slides end with questions

590
00:30:53,426 --> 00:30:57,008
because no one who does what I do knows what we're doing.

591
00:30:57,829 --> 00:30:59,970
So that's why it's only a five minute talk.

592
00:31:02,371 --> 00:31:04,253
Yeah, and archiving play itself,

593
00:31:04,933 --> 00:31:08,415
like how does that, yeah, it doesn't, who knows.

594
00:31:09,516 --> 00:31:10,196
So, more questions.

595
00:31:11,546 --> 00:31:18,113
Museums. Oh, what a wonderful photo of a great game at a museum. It's my game. Thank you.

596
00:31:21,131 --> 00:31:26,073
So, museums are kind of like where you show games to

597
00:31:27,114 --> 00:31:28,915
like a mix, a huge mix of people.

598
00:31:28,935 --> 00:31:31,756
You have to show it to people who come specifically

599
00:31:31,796 --> 00:31:34,098
because it's a games exhibition at a museum

600
00:31:35,078 --> 00:31:36,859
and they're expecting a lot of

601
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,680
like really focused content for them.

602
00:31:40,281 --> 00:31:42,001
You also have to realize that they wanna bring

603
00:31:42,762 --> 00:31:46,744
their grandma and their kids and there's a lot of people

604
00:31:46,764 --> 00:31:49,465
who won't know anything about games that'll wander through

605
00:31:49,545 --> 00:31:50,286
and they also want.

606
00:31:51,168 --> 00:31:53,970
to walk out with an overview.

607
00:31:54,950 --> 00:31:58,731
So trying to display games to that kind of audience,

608
00:31:59,352 --> 00:32:00,872
we have to kind of expect that they know

609
00:32:00,912 --> 00:32:01,712
exactly what they're doing,

610
00:32:01,772 --> 00:32:03,413
and they expect that they have no idea what they're doing,

611
00:32:04,153 --> 00:32:07,575
is tricky, to say the least.

612
00:32:08,275 --> 00:32:11,696
As well as you then have a responsibility

613
00:32:12,356 --> 00:32:14,557
to figure out what of this content do you show,

614
00:32:14,577 --> 00:32:17,358
and why are you showing it, and is it...

615
00:32:18,543 --> 00:32:19,664
the right content to show.

616
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:22,806
Because if you're representing a whole kind of

617
00:32:23,646 --> 00:32:25,468
swathe of games and

618
00:32:25,488 --> 00:32:27,469
you know, if you're

619
00:32:27,489 --> 00:32:30,711
trying to say this is video games, which unfortunately when you do a big

620
00:32:30,731 --> 00:32:31,812
exhibition at a museum

621
00:32:32,492 --> 00:32:33,253
you have to kind of

622
00:32:33,813 --> 00:32:35,034
represent all the video games.

623
00:32:36,855 --> 00:32:38,356
What you choose is really important.

624
00:32:39,897 --> 00:32:43,600
And the slides from the current V&A exhibition

625
00:32:44,801 --> 00:32:47,082
design, display, play, whatever it is.

626
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,399
And yeah, they had a lot of issues with that.

627
00:32:51,580 --> 00:32:54,501
People coming in expecting different games

628
00:32:54,822 --> 00:32:57,743
and not finding them, or finding my game

629
00:32:57,823 --> 00:32:59,044
and being like, I can't even play this,

630
00:32:59,664 --> 00:33:02,265
because no one can play that anymore.

631
00:33:03,546 --> 00:33:06,668
So let's go on to what I do, which is exhibitions.

632
00:33:07,568 --> 00:33:10,290
So this is like the less academic-y,

633
00:33:10,390 --> 00:33:12,851
more artsy side, I guess.

634
00:33:14,693 --> 00:33:16,474
So it's like making exhibitions,

635
00:33:18,575 --> 00:33:20,216
like I commission new games,

636
00:33:20,976 --> 00:33:22,917
and I sort of try to fill in the gaps

637
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:24,517
that I see in the games industry,

638
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:28,939
which is basically like how do you make,

639
00:33:29,379 --> 00:33:31,200
like there's no games that'll sort of appeal

640
00:33:31,240 --> 00:33:32,880
to someone completely new to games,

641
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,541
and someone who's like really likes games,

642
00:33:35,121 --> 00:33:36,042
but if you go to a bar,

643
00:33:36,802 --> 00:33:38,523
and you make a game for those kind of people,

644
00:33:39,383 --> 00:33:40,623
there is possibilities.

645
00:33:40,703 --> 00:33:42,944
There's a lot of spaces that games miss at the moment,

646
00:33:43,685 --> 00:33:43,805
and

647
00:33:44,953 --> 00:33:47,174
a lot of those are really personal, or really trashy,

648
00:33:47,294 --> 00:33:50,416
or really horrible, and people can't really make a living

649
00:33:50,476 --> 00:33:52,857
off those, and that's where the kind of arts model comes in.

650
00:33:53,817 --> 00:33:56,939
So at the moment, we are running a bunch of commissions

651
00:33:56,959 --> 00:33:59,300
this year, and we're getting local craft breweries

652
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:02,421
to pay for it, and that's very specific.

653
00:34:03,021 --> 00:34:06,023
But looking at games as art exhibitions

654
00:34:06,583 --> 00:34:09,244
is really interesting, especially because games

655
00:34:09,284 --> 00:34:12,185
are interactive, and you can do a lot more specific stuff

656
00:34:12,245 --> 00:34:14,546
with games than you can with other stuff.

657
00:34:15,397 --> 00:34:17,357
I mean, who likes paintings?

658
00:34:17,497 --> 00:34:20,378
No one, that's fine.

659
00:34:20,438 --> 00:34:21,718
So this is basically what I just said.

660
00:34:23,598 --> 00:34:30,620
And then, yeah, so even if you're not interested in curation, which is very understandable,

661
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:37,201
then I still encourage you to think about games as experiences and as a holistic kind

662
00:34:37,241 --> 00:34:40,402
of little thing, because if you're making something...

663
00:34:41,988 --> 00:34:44,510
it's very important to think about how this is going to be archived or

664
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:48,193
communicated to someone who's not currently there or can't play your game or

665
00:34:49,714 --> 00:34:51,775
yeah like what's going to be left after the apocalypse

666
00:34:52,676 --> 00:34:55,378
hopefully nothing but hey we can always hope

667
00:34:56,699 --> 00:34:59,120
but yeah there's a lot of questions and as I say this thing is this

668
00:34:59,340 --> 00:35:01,902
whole field is being pushed and explored so

669
00:35:02,823 --> 00:35:08,747
ask me questions if later afterwards if you're curious I have no answers

670
00:35:09,047 --> 00:35:10,648
but I will nod and smile

671
00:35:11,907 --> 00:35:12,127
thank you.

672
00:35:12,147 --> 00:35:12,388
Thank you.

673
00:35:12,428 --> 00:35:13,809
Thank you my friend.

674
00:35:13,849 --> 00:35:14,089
Thank you.

675
00:35:14,109 --> 00:35:14,289
Thank you.

676
00:35:14,309 --> 00:35:14,490
Thank you.

677
00:35:14,510 --> 00:35:14,710
Thank you.

678
00:35:14,730 --> 00:35:14,970
Thank you.

679
00:35:14,990 --> 00:35:15,190
Thank you.

680
00:35:15,330 --> 00:35:15,891
Thank you.

681
00:35:16,011 --> 00:35:16,752
Thank you.

682
00:35:16,772 --> 00:35:17,112
Thank you.

683
00:35:17,172 --> 00:35:17,613
Thank you.

684
00:35:17,633 --> 00:35:17,893
Thank you.

685
00:35:17,913 --> 00:35:18,153
Thank you.

686
00:35:18,173 --> 00:35:18,573
Thank you.

687
00:35:20,796 --> 00:35:21,036
Thank you.

688
00:35:21,056 --> 00:35:23,078
Thank you.

689
00:35:23,138 --> 00:35:23,378
Thank you.

690
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:24,099
Thank you.

691
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:25,380
Thank you.

692
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:25,680
Thank you.

693
00:35:25,700 --> 00:35:25,880
Thank you.

694
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:27,562
Thank you for coming.

695
00:35:27,582 --> 00:35:28,403
Thank you.

696
00:35:31,145 --> 00:35:37,872
Hello everyone, my name is Jane and I am going to talk a little bit about my career so far

697
00:35:38,353 --> 00:35:41,997
and the long and winding road that's led me here to games.

698
00:35:43,819 --> 00:35:47,022
I'll just open this for myself.

699
00:35:48,063 --> 00:35:49,605
Okay, so this is me.

700
00:35:51,853 --> 00:35:56,336
at the beginning of my journey towards games when I was navigating to this destination

701
00:35:56,376 --> 00:35:58,057
which I'm currently at, which is unknown.

702
00:35:59,278 --> 00:36:03,380
So my road into the games industry has been this long and winding road.

703
00:36:03,941 --> 00:36:05,922
I really wanted to help people initially.

704
00:36:05,942 --> 00:36:09,124
I thought the way to do that was to be an IT help desk person.

705
00:36:09,224 --> 00:36:10,504
So that was the start of my career.

706
00:36:11,225 --> 00:36:13,307
I then thought, no, this wasn't quite right.

707
00:36:13,547 --> 00:36:15,749
So I went and did psych training.

708
00:36:15,769 --> 00:36:19,172
I have a degree in behavioural science and psychology honours,

709
00:36:19,953 --> 00:36:23,256
which I then worked in a lot of different areas.

710
00:36:23,816 --> 00:36:28,401
So sleep health, adolescent health, trauma and stress studies,

711
00:36:28,641 --> 00:36:29,982
and spatial epidemiology,

712
00:36:30,022 --> 00:36:31,764
which is having a look at how the environment

713
00:36:32,184 --> 00:36:34,286
and the world around us impacts on our health.

714
00:36:34,867 --> 00:36:36,188
And I started thinking at that point,

715
00:36:37,477 --> 00:36:40,378
You know, we've also got these virtual environments and games

716
00:36:40,458 --> 00:36:41,718
and things that we engage with.

717
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,439
They impact on our health as well.

718
00:36:43,539 --> 00:36:47,160
What if we could design and create new media and new games

719
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,201
that are for helping us?

720
00:36:51,121 --> 00:36:54,122
So that's led me to this point where I'm hopping along

721
00:36:54,162 --> 00:36:58,223
and exploring a new path, trying to combine my skills

722
00:36:58,323 --> 00:37:02,985
and qualifications in psychology to help create games

723
00:37:03,305 --> 00:37:04,605
for positive change.

724
00:37:05,873 --> 00:37:07,494
So you might be thinking, oh, she's

725
00:37:07,514 --> 00:37:08,674
talking about gamification.

726
00:37:09,634 --> 00:37:11,275
You know, the intention is there.

727
00:37:11,935 --> 00:37:13,655
But what I really wanted to do with it

728
00:37:13,976 --> 00:37:17,116
is to go beyond where we're currently at there.

729
00:37:17,256 --> 00:37:19,117
And rather than create games which

730
00:37:19,157 --> 00:37:22,038
rely on extrinsic motivation and feedback loops

731
00:37:22,118 --> 00:37:24,198
and reinforcement schedules, actually

732
00:37:24,238 --> 00:37:26,139
have a look at the way that the human condition is

733
00:37:26,359 --> 00:37:29,699
and how we function, how we can change thoughts, feelings,

734
00:37:29,759 --> 00:37:33,320
and behavior, motivations, and attitudes.

735
00:37:33,921 --> 00:37:35,261
So that led me to my PhD.

736
00:37:37,143 --> 00:37:41,877
which is basically a culmination of three different disciplines,

737
00:37:42,117 --> 00:37:45,326
psychology, game design and narratology.

738
00:37:46,432 --> 00:37:54,073
I'm creating a framework to help game designers and game developers create games for positive

739
00:37:54,093 --> 00:37:54,433
change.

740
00:37:54,893 --> 00:38:00,494
So that includes everything such as attitude, motivation, thoughts, feelings, right through

741
00:38:00,574 --> 00:38:01,755
to behavioural change.

742
00:38:02,255 --> 00:38:05,415
And that little roundabout there, that's actually not part of the environment.

743
00:38:05,475 --> 00:38:06,456
That's my framework.

744
00:38:07,476 --> 00:38:10,957
So if you want to speak to me about that later, I can go into lots of detail about that.

745
00:38:12,910 --> 00:38:18,583
So that's one of the hats that I wear is this PhD combining all of those disciplines.

746
00:38:19,948 --> 00:38:23,769
Another hat in the industry that I wear is collaborative,

747
00:38:24,290 --> 00:38:26,551
research, consulting and game design.

748
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:30,632
So this is about bringing the psych skills of research

749
00:38:30,952 --> 00:38:34,714
and also psychology-driven game design

750
00:38:35,254 --> 00:38:38,475
into a project, one of the projects that I've worked on,

751
00:38:38,835 --> 00:38:41,356
with a studio in Australia called S1T2.

752
00:38:41,376 --> 00:38:44,858
They were developing a game to help kids in Fiji

753
00:38:45,638 --> 00:38:48,839
create better habits around exercise and diet.

754
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:52,241
and basically increase their quality of life.

755
00:38:52,381 --> 00:38:55,603
So I worked with them to develop some evaluation methods

756
00:38:55,683 --> 00:38:58,305
to make sure that if they're designing a game

757
00:38:58,365 --> 00:39:00,126
for these kinds of purposes, we want

758
00:39:00,146 --> 00:39:02,347
to know that it actually is doing what they want it to do.

759
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:05,369
Another project that I've.

760
00:39:05,949 --> 00:39:11,252
Contributed to is with a little indie studio down in Queensland called Fatality Studios

761
00:39:11,312 --> 00:39:17,334
and they're working on developing a VR game addressing a variety of phobias.

762
00:39:17,975 --> 00:39:25,198
And so I helped them create some evidence-based game design techniques based on what the phobias

763
00:39:25,378 --> 00:39:27,279
are and how they work.

764
00:39:29,482 --> 00:39:32,683
I've also done another collaboration, just an informal collaboration

765
00:39:32,723 --> 00:39:36,766
with some developers from Shell Games during a game jam.

766
00:39:36,806 --> 00:39:38,767
It was the Brain Jam in New York last year.

767
00:39:39,167 --> 00:39:42,109
And we created a VR education game

768
00:39:42,709 --> 00:39:47,271
for basically training distress tolerance skills using experiential

769
00:39:47,892 --> 00:39:49,913
engagement with the skills rather

770
00:39:49,953 --> 00:39:52,234
than just presenting didactic information.

771
00:39:55,598 --> 00:39:58,640
So the third hat that I probably wear

772
00:39:59,541 --> 00:40:03,044
is the games industry research and writing.

773
00:40:04,025 --> 00:40:08,909
So drawing on the psych background that I have,

774
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,312
I've contributed to a paper which is coming out soon,

775
00:40:12,372 --> 00:40:15,274
an industry paper on the general state of the games

776
00:40:15,314 --> 00:40:18,036
industry at the moment, and drawing on that.

777
00:40:18,977 --> 00:40:22,479
stress studies of, yeah, discussed some

778
00:40:22,619 --> 00:40:26,041
psychophysiological basis of stress

779
00:40:27,062 --> 00:40:30,204
in the industry. So that's going to be great when that comes out in a few weeks.

780
00:40:31,284 --> 00:40:34,566
Also working on publications like ethical design

781
00:40:34,626 --> 00:40:38,288
recommendations for creating VR games. I think it's a really

782
00:40:39,529 --> 00:40:42,671
important consideration to have a look at the kinds of situations

783
00:40:42,731 --> 00:40:45,493
which we're, and experiences that we're creating for people.

784
00:40:46,413 --> 00:40:48,194
So that's coming along as well.

785
00:40:49,134 --> 00:40:53,877
And also contributing to a book about designing frameworks

786
00:40:53,997 --> 00:40:58,800
for playful interactivity based on care and connection

787
00:40:58,900 --> 00:41:00,221
and personal growth.

788
00:41:00,801 --> 00:41:03,943
Because I think we can all agree it's a great opportunity

789
00:41:03,963 --> 00:41:09,066
to create games that care, that we care about,

790
00:41:09,306 --> 00:41:10,767
and that care about us.

791
00:41:12,339 --> 00:41:17,040
So if you're thinking of doing something in meaningful games

792
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:21,281
or impact games, and you're in the games industry,

793
00:41:21,361 --> 00:41:23,161
but you're thinking, well, how can I add to that?

794
00:41:23,781 --> 00:41:25,342
Psychology is a really great option

795
00:41:25,402 --> 00:41:27,382
to consider getting extra training in.

796
00:41:27,802 --> 00:41:29,543
I did psychology first, and there's

797
00:41:29,563 --> 00:41:31,503
a lot of other industry veterans as well

798
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:33,183
that have come from psych backgrounds

799
00:41:33,663 --> 00:41:34,804
and brought that to games.

800
00:41:35,324 --> 00:41:36,484
And there's lots of different ways

801
00:41:36,524 --> 00:41:38,324
you can utilize those combinations.

802
00:41:38,964 --> 00:41:39,204
So.

803
00:41:40,585 --> 00:41:42,425
Yeah, just a few of them.

804
00:41:43,426 --> 00:41:44,526
Just give me a moment here.

805
00:41:46,127 --> 00:41:47,127
Just a few of them.

806
00:41:47,947 --> 00:41:49,388
So Professor Isabella Granig,

807
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:52,209
she's a professor in developmental psychology.

808
00:41:52,269 --> 00:41:54,270
She runs a game lab in the Netherlands

809
00:41:54,330 --> 00:41:55,930
called Games for Emotional and Mental Health

810
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:00,072
and a game lab called the Development Arm

811
00:42:00,132 --> 00:42:01,312
called Play Nice Institute.

812
00:42:01,333 --> 00:42:03,293
So they actually create meaningful impact games.

813
00:42:04,542 --> 00:42:08,844
There's Dr. B sitting down here with his clinical psych, PhD,

814
00:42:09,584 --> 00:42:11,565
working in games advocacy type roles,

815
00:42:11,765 --> 00:42:16,187
and also providing research and providing clinical services

816
00:42:16,207 --> 00:42:17,587
at SafePoint Behavioural Health.

817
00:42:18,187 --> 00:42:19,488
So there's lots of different ways

818
00:42:19,528 --> 00:42:23,650
that you can utilise this combination of disciplines.

819
00:42:24,530 --> 00:42:25,651
And I think there's a lot of magic

820
00:42:25,691 --> 00:42:28,792
that lies in between disciplines that we can explore as well.

821
00:42:28,812 --> 00:42:28,852
So...

822
00:42:33,127 --> 00:42:38,229
The wonderful thing about doing something that is cross-industry and cross-discipline,

823
00:42:38,769 --> 00:42:45,252
like partly sitting in a university so you can conduct research and partly in industry

824
00:42:45,352 --> 00:42:50,914
so that you can be part of development cycles and evaluation cycles, is that there's just

825
00:42:50,974 --> 00:42:51,895
so much variance.

826
00:42:52,495 --> 00:42:56,756
One minute you might be writing a paper, next minute you're actually talking about how to

827
00:42:56,796 --> 00:43:01,358
create a mechanic that, you know, is going to assist people with confronting a phobia.

828
00:43:02,563 --> 00:43:07,628
So there's a lot of variation, a lot of challenges, but each of these challenges actually presents

829
00:43:07,688 --> 00:43:09,069
wonderful opportunities as well.

830
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:15,075
So you're creating a new kind of role that doesn't really exist at the moment, but there's

831
00:43:15,095 --> 00:43:19,479
a lot of freedom in that because there's no path carved for you, so you get to carve that

832
00:43:19,519 --> 00:43:20,140
path yourself.

833
00:43:21,020 --> 00:43:26,783
It's, as I've said, it's multidisciplinary, it's multi-industry, and we don't need to

834
00:43:26,844 --> 00:43:29,705
keep our jobs in silos anymore.

835
00:43:29,745 --> 00:43:35,948
We don't have to stand and, you know, just be a psychologist or just be a game designer.

836
00:43:36,309 --> 00:43:38,089
We can actually sit in the space in the middle.

837
00:43:38,890 --> 00:43:43,592
So those challenges are actually great opportunities for creating something new.

838
00:43:44,073 --> 00:43:46,334
And of course, like Jewel was saying, with freelancing.

839
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:49,683
you can actually create the kind of career that you want.

840
00:43:49,784 --> 00:43:50,947
There's a lot of freedom in that,

841
00:43:50,967 --> 00:43:52,332
there's a lot of challenge in that.

842
00:43:53,236 --> 00:43:56,177
but it is quite amazing.

843
00:43:56,197 --> 00:44:01,099
So I'll finish up with, yeah, just this thought,

844
00:44:01,360 --> 00:44:05,501
that there are so many impactful perspectives and stories

845
00:44:05,581 --> 00:44:06,222
to be told.

846
00:44:06,542 --> 00:44:08,203
And basically, at the heart of my work

847
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:10,143
with bringing psychology to games

848
00:44:10,924 --> 00:44:15,326
is about creating meaning and bringing care into games.

849
00:44:15,426 --> 00:44:18,247
How do we create games, and how do we

850
00:44:18,327 --> 00:44:21,308
create a better industry that we care about

851
00:44:21,448 --> 00:44:22,429
and that cares about us?

852
00:44:23,671 --> 00:44:26,053
So, yes, that's my one talk away.

853
00:44:26,313 --> 00:44:29,175
Let's use all our available tools,

854
00:44:29,316 --> 00:44:33,079
perspectives and disciplines to create new directions.

855
00:44:33,719 --> 00:44:34,079
Thank you.

856
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:34,860
Thank you.

857
00:44:34,880 --> 00:44:35,100
Thank you.

858
00:44:35,320 --> 00:44:35,500
Thank you.

859
00:44:35,661 --> 00:44:36,401
Thank you.

860
00:44:36,421 --> 00:44:37,802
Thank you.

861
00:44:38,002 --> 00:44:38,423
Thank you.

862
00:44:49,011 --> 00:44:49,271
Thank you.

863
00:44:49,291 --> 00:44:49,812
Kia ora everyone.

864
00:44:50,292 --> 00:44:51,053
My name is Jade.

865
00:44:52,136 --> 00:44:59,342
I'm the senior sound designer and composer and pew pew noisemaker at Pikpok, which is

866
00:44:59,362 --> 00:45:02,405
a mobile game company based in Wellington, New Zealand.

867
00:45:02,425 --> 00:45:03,646
Anyone here heard of Pikpok?

868
00:45:04,487 --> 00:45:06,489
Or Pikpok, as they say in Australia?

869
00:45:08,470 --> 00:45:08,951
So this is me.

870
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:12,823
Like I said, I'm the senior audio designer at PicBock.

871
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:14,925
I'm also audio director at Awesome Source

872
00:45:15,485 --> 00:45:16,886
with my wonderful fiance.

873
00:45:18,207 --> 00:45:19,809
That's me in the middle.

874
00:45:20,709 --> 00:45:23,692
And that's me in my dreams as the cat below.

875
00:45:23,732 --> 00:45:25,053
That's how I wake up every morning.

876
00:45:25,073 --> 00:45:26,494
It's my motivational speech.

877
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:29,256
A little bit about behind the scenes.

878
00:45:30,277 --> 00:45:31,538
I was adorable as a child.

879
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:32,259
I can't help that.

880
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:33,740
That was my genetics.

881
00:45:34,761 --> 00:45:37,463
I, when I was, I went through school, I was a band geek.

882
00:45:38,024 --> 00:45:38,965
I played the drums.

883
00:45:39,804 --> 00:45:41,124
Then I decided to join the army.

884
00:45:41,284 --> 00:45:43,146
Horrible idea, sorry if you were in the army.

885
00:45:43,866 --> 00:45:45,827
Left the army and then I wanted to be famous

886
00:45:45,987 --> 00:45:49,790
and became a DJ and did some duff duff in the bush

887
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:51,871
and out and doing all this sort of stuff.

888
00:45:52,485 --> 00:45:58,950
Turned 30, decided that everybody in the nightclub was at least 10 years younger than I am, had

889
00:45:58,970 --> 00:46:03,313
a bit of a midlife crisis, and decided to be a sound designer.

890
00:46:03,413 --> 00:46:09,978
Went to university, studied audio engineering at School of Audio Engineering, and then moved

891
00:46:10,038 --> 00:46:15,622
into YouTube because the audio engineering school didn't quite help me and gave me what

892
00:46:15,662 --> 00:46:21,226
I needed, and self-taught myself all the way up, got a job at Pikpok.

893
00:46:24,074 --> 00:46:30,801
The picture on the right with the Kiwi in the middle is myself and my fiance Brogan.

894
00:46:31,521 --> 00:46:37,026
We own the business Awesome Sauce and also for PikPok which is, and we also like I said

895
00:46:37,066 --> 00:46:42,812
work for PikPok who do Into the Dead 2 which is one of our, and Into the Dead 1 which is

896
00:46:42,852 --> 00:46:46,395
our most famous games if you like killing zombies.

897
00:46:47,456 --> 00:46:49,258
So a little bit about the team at PikPok.

898
00:46:50,302 --> 00:46:55,426
This is Jason, he's our sound designer, one of our lead sound designers at PikPok.

899
00:46:55,486 --> 00:46:58,669
He's a bit mad like me, which is great, you can probably tell from his face.

900
00:46:59,369 --> 00:47:03,252
And this is our little junior sound designer, he just started this year.

901
00:47:03,333 --> 00:47:04,874
Tim, he's an amazing guy.

902
00:47:05,094 --> 00:47:12,099
If you ever need to hire somebody, like the reason why we got this guy is he turned up

903
00:47:12,119 --> 00:47:15,102
and we asked him if he knew how to use FMOD and he went no.

904
00:47:15,914 --> 00:47:17,835
And then when he started the job, he was an expert.

905
00:47:17,935 --> 00:47:19,156
Not quite sure how he did that.

906
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:19,777
He went away.

907
00:47:19,857 --> 00:47:20,377
He learnt.

908
00:47:21,598 --> 00:47:28,922
Last, but certainly not least, is Brogan, my fiancé, but also she's our resident composer.

909
00:47:29,863 --> 00:47:31,143
That's her with our son.

910
00:47:35,086 --> 00:47:35,966
His name is Rocket.

911
00:47:36,226 --> 00:47:39,649
He features a little bit in this talk.

912
00:47:40,209 --> 00:47:41,350
So where do you start?

913
00:47:43,646 --> 00:47:45,529
I just let that go, it's kind of my favourite.

914
00:47:46,371 --> 00:47:47,152
So what do I do?

915
00:47:47,833 --> 00:47:49,055
Essentially, what do I do?

916
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:52,841
This next picture kind of really sums up everything.

917
00:47:56,641 --> 00:47:58,301
This is actually my cat, Rocket.

918
00:47:59,562 --> 00:48:01,702
He's not trained.

919
00:48:01,782 --> 00:48:04,363
It was a one-off moment we got this photo.

920
00:48:04,903 --> 00:48:08,704
But basically I record weird sounds and then I make them into things.

921
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:13,405
So I create a living world in games through audio.

922
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,605
I take everything I see in a game and then make a sound for it.

923
00:48:16,765 --> 00:48:19,706
And then I literally make pew-pew noises with my sound.

924
00:48:19,746 --> 00:48:20,526
I'm very good at it now.

925
00:48:21,026 --> 00:48:22,547
Pew, pew, see? It's great.

926
00:48:25,430 --> 00:48:28,372
So why is it fun to be a sound designer in pictures?

927
00:48:28,412 --> 00:48:29,874
Well, I get to do cool stuff like this.

928
00:48:29,954 --> 00:48:32,135
I get to go hang out in awesome recording studios

929
00:48:32,176 --> 00:48:34,578
and pretend I'm cool, when I'm not actually.

930
00:48:34,998 --> 00:48:36,459
And I get to work with amazing musicians

931
00:48:36,499 --> 00:48:39,862
like Thomas Oliver, who's an amazing Wisenborn player.

932
00:48:39,942 --> 00:48:41,844
If you don't know what a Wisenborn is, look it up.

933
00:48:41,884 --> 00:48:43,785
They're absolutely incredible pieces of equipment.

934
00:48:44,446 --> 00:48:47,669
I get to get squeaky toys and put them into microphones.

935
00:48:48,089 --> 00:48:49,670
And then I get to stare at people's backs

936
00:48:49,790 --> 00:48:51,312
for about eight hours a day,

937
00:48:51,352 --> 00:48:53,333
which is the highlight of everything I get to do.

938
00:48:54,455 --> 00:48:55,656
So, Squeaky Toy is my fun.

939
00:48:55,756 --> 00:48:57,418
I get to write out awesome lyric sheets.

940
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:04,545
This is literally the lyrics that we wrote for a monster.

941
00:49:04,946 --> 00:49:11,033
I liked how there's a hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm, question marks there.

942
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:12,774
So we get to do fun stuff like that.

943
00:49:13,415 --> 00:49:14,536
And it's a lot of fun.

944
00:49:16,279 --> 00:49:18,120
This is myself and Brogan.

945
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,981
We get to go out and do a whole bunch of recording, which is exciting.

946
00:49:22,061 --> 00:49:26,483
So we basically go into rubbish tips or dumps

947
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,625
and throw our bodies into them and make sounds.

948
00:49:30,005 --> 00:49:32,626
We get to go to rivers and splash in them like a child.

949
00:49:32,706 --> 00:49:34,187
It's like my dream job.

950
00:49:34,587 --> 00:49:38,409
We also get to sellotape microphones to your fiancé's face,

951
00:49:39,309 --> 00:49:40,510
which I highly recommend.

952
00:49:42,376 --> 00:49:51,604
This was going to be a video of me killing, well not literally, but of a voice actor that

953
00:49:51,644 --> 00:49:53,025
we recorded for Into the Dead 2.

954
00:49:53,105 --> 00:49:58,429
It was the most epic death scene I have ever, ever recorded and it went for about a minute

955
00:49:58,529 --> 00:50:00,891
long and he fainted at the end of it.

956
00:50:01,111 --> 00:50:04,954
Sadly, we don't have the video, but when you hit me up on Twitter, if you see on Twitter,

957
00:50:04,974 --> 00:50:07,196
I'll post that video and I tell you I recommend it.

958
00:50:08,397 --> 00:50:11,199
When working in sound, you have to work with a lot of hazards.

959
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,121
There's a lot of things that happen, such as this.

960
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:16,483
Like, sometimes it gets pretty tricky when you're working

961
00:50:16,503 --> 00:50:19,386
and you have a cute, adorable kitten that lies across your keyboard.

962
00:50:19,786 --> 00:50:23,269
I often have to call my boss and say,

963
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:26,792
look, I can't work today because look, look at him.

964
00:50:27,192 --> 00:50:28,093
He's so adorable.

965
00:50:28,834 --> 00:50:30,535
Oh, let's just stare at him a little bit more.

966
00:50:30,595 --> 00:50:30,675
No.

967
00:50:31,856 --> 00:50:36,961
So why get into sound design? Because being a little mad is fun. As you probably notice, I'm a little bit crazy.

968
00:50:37,741 --> 00:50:43,947
And that's what we get to do. We get to go pew pew and zzzz and stuff like this and get paid for it. I don't know why.

969
00:50:45,168 --> 00:50:49,591
You get to make sounds for games. Let's just say that again. I get to make sounds for games.

970
00:50:49,912 --> 00:50:54,255
It's like, I played games all my life. Now I get to make sounds for them. So I can't go wrong.

971
00:50:54,996 --> 00:50:58,078
I'll be a part of around people who are crazy about audio and in games.

972
00:50:58,158 --> 00:50:59,719
We're an odd bunch, you probably noticed.

973
00:51:00,779 --> 00:51:02,160
Did I mention pupil noises?

974
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:06,562
I probably did a few times, so that's pretty much what I do.

975
00:51:06,782 --> 00:51:10,544
Make pupil noises and make video for games.

976
00:51:10,664 --> 00:51:12,065
So that's the end of our talk.

977
00:51:12,665 --> 00:51:13,046
Hit me up.

978
00:51:13,566 --> 00:51:14,867
That's me on Instagram.

979
00:51:15,087 --> 00:51:17,888
And just a slight nod, we're hiring.

980
00:51:19,829 --> 00:51:20,470
Thank you very much.

981
00:51:28,993 --> 00:51:30,994
I cannot believe you guys were on time.

982
00:51:31,054 --> 00:51:32,434
Well done, everybody.

983
00:51:32,454 --> 00:51:34,795
I may have threatened them a little bit.

984
00:51:35,835 --> 00:51:39,056
So we do have time for just maybe one or two questions.

985
00:51:39,877 --> 00:51:42,397
Feel free to join us in the wrap up room just across the

986
00:51:42,417 --> 00:51:45,198
hall, it's literally just walk out that way.

987
00:51:46,679 --> 00:51:47,779
So any questions?

988
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:51,661
Not even about my cat?

989
00:51:56,562 --> 00:51:56,662
Hi.

990
00:51:57,283 --> 00:51:57,543
Oh, hello.

991
00:51:57,563 --> 00:52:00,064
Sorry, I will have a question then if no one else is coming up here.

992
00:52:00,785 --> 00:52:03,306
What are your thoughts on full motion videos in the industry?

993
00:52:04,087 --> 00:52:07,969
And what's the potential for that in the near future, if you have any?

994
00:52:08,469 --> 00:52:10,030
Just to rephrase the question real quick.

995
00:52:10,090 --> 00:52:13,812
So your question is around full motion video, and was that audio?

996
00:52:15,393 --> 00:52:16,474
Oh, yeah, sorry.

997
00:52:16,734 --> 00:52:22,437
Just in general, what are your thoughts, or have you had any experiences for the panel

998
00:52:22,517 --> 00:52:25,479
regarding full motion videos as a niche industry?

999
00:52:27,454 --> 00:52:28,334
I've never used any.

1000
00:52:29,154 --> 00:52:29,434
Hello.

1001
00:52:29,594 --> 00:52:31,595
I've never used any full motion videos.

1002
00:52:32,095 --> 00:52:34,136
Everything's mainly cut scenes for us.

1003
00:52:36,137 --> 00:52:36,397
Yeah.

1004
00:52:36,477 --> 00:52:37,457
Anybody have any?

1005
00:52:37,777 --> 00:52:37,938
No.

1006
00:52:37,978 --> 00:52:38,298
Sorry.

1007
00:52:38,338 --> 00:52:39,258
Cannot help you, sir.

1008
00:52:39,638 --> 00:52:39,858
Sorry.

1009
00:52:39,878 --> 00:52:41,199
I'll put that person on the panel next year.

1010
00:52:41,219 --> 00:52:41,679
Yeah, next year.

1011
00:52:41,699 --> 00:52:41,779
Yeah.

1012
00:52:41,799 --> 00:52:41,899
Yeah.

1013
00:52:41,979 --> 00:52:42,119
Yeah.

1014
00:52:42,139 --> 00:52:42,259
Yeah.

1015
00:52:42,279 --> 00:52:42,459
Yeah.

1016
00:52:42,499 --> 00:52:42,639
Yeah.

1017
00:52:42,659 --> 00:52:42,739
Yeah.

1018
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:42,839
Yeah.

1019
00:52:42,859 --> 00:52:42,979
Yeah.

1020
00:52:42,999 --> 00:52:43,079
Yeah.

1021
00:52:43,099 --> 00:52:43,200
Yeah.

1022
00:52:43,220 --> 00:52:43,340
Yeah.

1023
00:52:43,540 --> 00:52:43,620
Yeah.

1024
00:52:45,090 --> 00:52:47,731
Hello. Thank you very much for all of your presentations.

1025
00:52:48,952 --> 00:52:54,576
For those who perhaps just graduated and are trying to get a salaried full-time position

1026
00:52:54,596 --> 00:53:00,740
but maybe can't get one right away, do you all have any suggestions for like a temp agency

1027
00:53:00,820 --> 00:53:04,362
or something like that that could get you work in between times?

1028
00:53:05,843 --> 00:53:10,626
So just to reframe real quick, any recommendations from the panel on new grads

1029
00:53:10,807 --> 00:53:12,608
and how to find work within the industry?

1030
00:53:17,224 --> 00:53:20,785
I mean if you're capable of making, I don't know what you might have went to school for,

1031
00:53:20,845 --> 00:53:25,728
but like I know it's not paid, but game jams are really awesome, or hackathons.

1032
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:31,770
Regardless of whether you end up with a job right away after those sort of things, you

1033
00:53:31,830 --> 00:53:37,013
meet people, and that's how you get jobs in, I think, in this industry.

1034
00:53:37,393 --> 00:53:40,074
You meet people, and you find out, I can work with them.

1035
00:53:40,494 --> 00:53:44,816
I generally have a connection with them, and once you create that connection with a person,

1036
00:53:45,497 --> 00:53:51,121
they want to help you too, because we generally want to help everyone in the game industry.

1037
00:53:51,501 --> 00:53:58,146
So that's kind of my suggestion. Work with someone on a hackathon or a game jam or just

1038
00:53:58,506 --> 00:54:04,010
hang out with people and try to be their friend. Don't try to necessarily beg them for a job,

1039
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:10,314
I think. I don't know. Go to events like this. Some of the best connections I've made have been

1040
00:54:10,454 --> 00:54:13,216
at game events, PAX, TwitchCon here.

1041
00:54:13,894 --> 00:54:16,115
uh... and network but like not like network

1042
00:54:16,475 --> 00:54:19,356
hi i'm this and this is what i do and i want to talk

1043
00:54:19,736 --> 00:54:22,997
network in like actually making real connections with people make friends

1044
00:54:23,537 --> 00:54:24,977
because like she said that's how you

1045
00:54:25,657 --> 00:54:28,718
end up getting that job you want because someone will know someone will know

1046
00:54:28,758 --> 00:54:29,659
someone and they'll remember

1047
00:54:29,879 --> 00:54:30,739
that guy was really cool

1048
00:54:31,239 --> 00:54:32,959
and he does this and i'm gonna remember him

1049
00:54:33,300 --> 00:54:33,760
yeah agreed

1050
00:54:34,415 --> 00:54:36,516
And just off of that, follow people on Twitter.

1051
00:54:37,416 --> 00:54:39,577
Twitter is actually one of the most accessible places

1052
00:54:39,697 --> 00:54:42,058
for just reaching out to random game devs.

1053
00:54:42,158 --> 00:54:44,139
There's a little more friction in adding somebody

1054
00:54:44,279 --> 00:54:46,700
on say LinkedIn, if I don't already know you,

1055
00:54:46,760 --> 00:54:47,740
I may not accept it.

1056
00:54:48,241 --> 00:54:51,562
But I'm on Twitter 24-7 and I love helping people

1057
00:54:51,662 --> 00:54:53,923
and I've seen that consistently across the industry.

1058
00:54:53,963 --> 00:54:55,683
People just like to help each other out here.

1059
00:54:55,989 --> 00:54:58,490
Tara likes to help us all up here on this panel.

1060
00:54:58,510 --> 00:54:59,291
She's been amazing.

1061
00:54:59,851 --> 00:55:00,751
And confirm, guys.

1062
00:55:01,612 --> 00:55:04,293
I would also say don't get a job.

1063
00:55:04,973 --> 00:55:06,594
I mean, no, do get a job.

1064
00:55:06,834 --> 00:55:07,234
You need money.

1065
00:55:07,935 --> 00:55:11,376
But my general kind of thing, especially in Australia,

1066
00:55:11,657 --> 00:55:15,378
is work at a pub or work somewhere else.

1067
00:55:17,339 --> 00:55:19,620
It's not often that you'll get a job and you'll get a salary

1068
00:55:19,800 --> 00:55:20,341
and then that's it.

1069
00:55:21,081 --> 00:55:25,024
It's just like, you know, you'll need to sort of figure out, yeah, connections and where

1070
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:28,766
you fit in the industry and what you kind of want to particularly go towards.

1071
00:55:29,406 --> 00:55:36,231
And I find like the happiest people that are sort of in that scene are working at a bakery

1072
00:55:36,511 --> 00:55:40,313
or a pub or somewhere and they're just, you know, like their work is over here and then

1073
00:55:40,634 --> 00:55:42,875
they use their free time to sort of...

1074
00:55:43,616 --> 00:55:49,963
network to jam, make games, work on their portfolio, and just figure out where they're

1075
00:55:49,983 --> 00:55:56,470
heading, sort of thing. Without the financial burden of, I need to get a full-time job or I'm done.

1076
00:55:57,994 --> 00:56:01,895
And also then you end up in industry and you've got experience of things that aren't just video games.

1077
00:56:02,596 --> 00:56:08,298
And you know, you can, yeah, that's really actually valuable to have like, just experiences of random jobs and

1078
00:56:08,318 --> 00:56:13,659
yeah, that kind of stuff when you get into video games. It comes in handy, I can vouch for that.

1079
00:56:14,800 --> 00:56:14,960
Cool.

1080
00:56:15,560 --> 00:56:16,060
Thank you so much.

1081
00:56:17,420 --> 00:56:24,186
Hi. I wanted to ask about kind of getting into the game industry in a roundabout way,

1082
00:56:24,246 --> 00:56:29,892
potentially focusing on something that's less visible. My personal example would be I am very

1083
00:56:29,932 --> 00:56:35,056
much focused on cyber security, and I would like to look at potentially anti-cheat when it comes

1084
00:56:35,076 --> 00:56:35,737
to video games.

1085
00:56:36,357 --> 00:56:44,608
The thing is it's a bit less visible in my opinion and I was hoping to get you guys'

1086
00:56:44,668 --> 00:56:51,617
opinion on potentially breaking into that side of the industry that doesn't look like

1087
00:56:51,637 --> 00:56:52,938
game design or isn't that flashy.

1088
00:56:54,175 --> 00:56:59,500
Okay, so the question's around breaking into a fairly niche role, so more around cyber

1089
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:00,001
security.

1090
00:57:01,242 --> 00:57:05,706
I'll kind of recommend, again, the network side of things, but if you can identify companies

1091
00:57:05,746 --> 00:57:09,670
that are doing something in that realm, and then you can identify who works there and

1092
00:57:09,730 --> 00:57:10,131
reach out.

1093
00:57:10,531 --> 00:57:15,876
So, like, for example, I know the 2HAT folks do a lot of stuff around, like, player safety,

1094
00:57:17,057 --> 00:57:18,318
secure spaces, et cetera.

1095
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:22,484
If that was in line with what you're looking to do,

1096
00:57:22,844 --> 00:57:24,725
I would find out who's at that company.

1097
00:57:24,865 --> 00:57:26,445
I would try to find them at events.

1098
00:57:26,525 --> 00:57:27,865
I would reach out on LinkedIn.

1099
00:57:27,925 --> 00:57:28,946
I'd reach out on Twitter

1100
00:57:29,086 --> 00:57:31,326
and just start to build that relationship

1101
00:57:31,366 --> 00:57:34,127
because those people will be critical

1102
00:57:34,287 --> 00:57:35,967
to pointing you in the right direction.

1103
00:57:37,007 --> 00:57:38,308
And you know, just don't be a dick.

1104
00:57:38,448 --> 00:57:40,268
Like that's baseline.

1105
00:57:40,288 --> 00:57:41,628
Don't be an asshole to these people.

1106
00:57:41,668 --> 00:57:42,789
Always say thank you.

1107
00:57:42,909 --> 00:57:44,289
Yeah, don't be a dick bro.

1108
00:57:46,069 --> 00:57:46,330
Thank you.

1109
00:57:48,592 --> 00:57:51,654
Hi, I just wanted to say thank you all for this presentation.

1110
00:57:51,674 --> 00:57:54,235
Each presentation was spectacular.

1111
00:57:54,835 --> 00:57:57,777
And I was just, this was more of a specific question,

1112
00:57:57,857 --> 00:58:01,159
but I'm interested in narrative writing.

1113
00:58:01,700 --> 00:58:04,521
So do you have any pointers or tips

1114
00:58:04,601 --> 00:58:07,323
for getting into narrative writing?

1115
00:58:07,343 --> 00:58:08,884
Do you have to make some stories first?

1116
00:58:08,904 --> 00:58:09,724
Do you read a lot?

1117
00:58:11,466 --> 00:58:17,412
Yeah, well both of those things, I think the most important thing today would be make a

1118
00:58:17,452 --> 00:58:23,778
game either at a game jam with other people or just download something like Inkle or Twine

1119
00:58:23,858 --> 00:58:25,760
and you can start making things today.

1120
00:58:26,561 --> 00:58:30,244
And then don't just make the game, get other people to play it and test it.

1121
00:58:31,005 --> 00:58:34,568
Start to learn how to work with feedback.

1122
00:58:35,770 --> 00:58:42,400
improve your work and that way when you're in a position to interview for a position you'll have already a

1123
00:58:42,800 --> 00:58:44,924
Like a substantial portfolio to show people

1124
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:51,233
Thank you. I think we have time for one last question as long as it's quick and then we got to go to the wrap-up room

1125
00:58:51,827 --> 00:58:57,613
Okay, yeah, quick question. First of all, thank you. As a person that is still a student,

1126
00:58:58,614 --> 00:59:05,282
I really want to do something multidisciplinary in regards of having a positive impact on

1127
00:59:05,342 --> 00:59:07,804
people. So I was wondering as someone...

1128
00:59:08,305 --> 00:59:14,627
Hello, yeah, exactly. Hi. I was wondering what are some, you know, some other

1129
00:59:15,767 --> 00:59:19,048
you know, curriculums I could be looking into outside of game design

1130
00:59:19,489 --> 00:59:26,311
currently, you know, some other courses, you know, that you think would be beneficial for someone that is wanting to get into a multidisciplinary side.

1131
00:59:27,126 --> 00:59:32,451
Yeah, I think it's a great intention knowing that right at the beginning that you want to be in that space in between.

1132
00:59:33,652 --> 00:59:36,795
It's really, I don't have any specific course...

1133
00:59:37,435 --> 00:59:38,596
Yeah, Amanda, I can interject.

1134
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:40,458
...couples or advice, but we can talk afterwards.

1135
00:59:40,478 --> 00:59:41,799
That would be great.

1136
00:59:41,959 --> 00:59:48,945
I think the thing is, just still similar answer, make connections with people who are kind of in that similar space

1137
00:59:49,366 --> 00:59:52,649
and connect with them and have a look at what their path was because...

1138
00:59:53,169 --> 00:59:57,053
It's all, even though it might be similar ingredients,

1139
00:59:57,253 --> 01:00:00,496
you know, with the disciplines, each of us are kind of walking

1140
01:00:00,536 --> 01:00:01,877
slightly different paths anyway.

1141
01:00:02,037 --> 01:00:06,001
So seek out your people and your community and just talk about

1142
01:00:06,101 --> 01:00:09,504
what's really worked for them and maybe what's not been

1143
01:00:09,524 --> 01:00:10,265
so beneficial.

1144
01:00:10,705 --> 01:00:11,486
Okay, great.

1145
01:00:11,526 --> 01:00:11,926
Thank you.

1146
01:00:11,967 --> 01:00:12,367
Let's chat.

1147
01:00:12,647 --> 01:00:12,807
Yeah.

1148
01:00:13,068 --> 01:00:13,348
Awesome.

1149
01:00:14,169 --> 01:00:15,830
And again, thank you all for joining us today.

1150
01:00:15,870 --> 01:00:19,033
We'll be over in the wrap-up room and have a great rest of your GDC.
