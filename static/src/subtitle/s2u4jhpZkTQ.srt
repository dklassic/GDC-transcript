1
00:00:04,855 --> 00:00:06,456
How you guys doing?

2
00:00:06,456 --> 00:00:08,777
Oh, come on, it's the first day of GDC.

3
00:00:08,777 --> 00:00:10,218
You're not drunk yet.

4
00:00:10,218 --> 00:00:12,979
All right.

5
00:00:12,979 --> 00:00:16,721
Hi, my name is Greg Furch.

6
00:00:16,721 --> 00:00:21,904
I'm honored to be here and talk about pre-production.

7
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:22,824
Like I said, I'm Greg Furch.

8
00:00:22,824 --> 00:00:24,565
So, I've worked on a lot of games.

9
00:00:24,565 --> 00:00:26,526
The talk that I'm going to give

10
00:00:26,526 --> 00:00:29,808
is really focused mainly on XCOM,

11
00:00:29,808 --> 00:00:31,329
Enemy Unknown, and XCOM 2.

12
00:00:34,375 --> 00:00:36,917
and kind of how we approach pre-production for those.

13
00:00:36,917 --> 00:00:37,418
So what is pre-production?

14
00:00:37,418 --> 00:00:40,700
You know, this is a term that we all throw around.

15
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,343
But this is actually the definition of it.

16
00:00:45,343 --> 00:00:49,126
And it doesn't say anything about games, right?

17
00:00:49,126 --> 00:00:51,268
It's a movie term.

18
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:53,649
But while

19
00:00:55,004 --> 00:00:57,645
We have all the same things that a movie has.

20
00:00:57,645 --> 00:00:59,665
You've gotta figure out your locations

21
00:00:59,665 --> 00:01:01,286
and your characters and your costumes

22
00:01:01,286 --> 00:01:03,406
and casting, all that stuff.

23
00:01:03,406 --> 00:01:05,787
It doesn't have anything about it not being linear.

24
00:01:05,787 --> 00:01:07,287
Doesn't have anything about technology.

25
00:01:07,287 --> 00:01:10,648
All those things that really can kinda crush you.

26
00:01:10,648 --> 00:01:11,308
Or interactivity.

27
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:17,789
So, something about pre-production that I've found,

28
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:20,470
everybody I talk to, every AD I talk to,

29
00:01:20,470 --> 00:01:23,871
every studio I talk to, everybody does it different.

30
00:01:25,031 --> 00:01:26,552
And there's a reason for that.

31
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,873
Every game is a little bit different.

32
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:33,055
The team that's working on the game is a little bit different.

33
00:01:33,055 --> 00:01:37,197
And you've got to cater to those as you're making your game.

34
00:01:37,197 --> 00:01:41,979
So when you read a postmortem about every game,

35
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:44,320
every time you read one, how many times

36
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,162
have you read postmortems where they say,

37
00:01:48,162 --> 00:01:52,224
the team was tired after coming off the last project?

38
00:01:53,091 --> 00:01:54,853
They don't have the right people on the project early,

39
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:58,417
because the people that are really, really good

40
00:01:58,417 --> 00:02:01,560
are closing out the project that is finishing.

41
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,704
Not having enough answers or time, right?

42
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:06,965
Not enough time, not enough money.

43
00:02:06,965 --> 00:02:10,649
And then also not defining your requirements

44
00:02:10,649 --> 00:02:13,712
to exit pre-production and enter production.

45
00:02:15,076 --> 00:02:19,957
And the idea that that's even a hard date is something that is a whole other talk, right?

46
00:02:19,957 --> 00:02:26,119
Whether or not entering production is an actual date that you enter or if it's a staggered

47
00:02:26,119 --> 00:02:26,279
enter.

48
00:02:26,279 --> 00:02:28,419
And I believe it's a staggered enter.

49
00:02:28,419 --> 00:02:31,500
Like characters finish early in the pre-production pipeline.

50
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:35,461
Environments probably trail behind that a little bit.

51
00:02:37,181 --> 00:02:40,584
UI can trail behind, just like they do

52
00:02:40,584 --> 00:02:42,966
when you're hitting RTM, it's the same kind of thing.

53
00:02:42,966 --> 00:02:47,269
As you're getting closer, they're trailing disciplines,

54
00:02:47,269 --> 00:02:49,351
and the same thing applies for pre-production.

55
00:02:49,351 --> 00:02:50,252
But that's a whole different talk.

56
00:02:50,252 --> 00:02:54,715
So a lot of the mistakes I think that art directors make,

57
00:02:54,715 --> 00:02:59,039
especially new ones, and I know I've done this too,

58
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,743
You know, they don't consider the presentation.

59
00:03:02,743 --> 00:03:05,586
Like, where is the camera going to be for the game?

60
00:03:05,586 --> 00:03:08,128
How is the player going to experience it?

61
00:03:08,128 --> 00:03:12,551
Right, and this is something that I am super passionate about.

62
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:14,413
Like, I believe this is the key of art direction.

63
00:03:14,413 --> 00:03:16,475
Overestimating pretty pictures.

64
00:03:16,475 --> 00:03:18,977
I think a lot of people get into art direction, right?

65
00:03:18,977 --> 00:03:21,298
And you're like, hey, that's a really pretty picture

66
00:03:21,298 --> 00:03:21,959
up there, isn't it?

67
00:03:22,967 --> 00:03:26,589
It doesn't solve anything for me other than mood.

68
00:03:26,589 --> 00:03:28,311
It doesn't really give me any information.

69
00:03:28,311 --> 00:03:30,872
I can't hand it to a modeler and say make it

70
00:03:30,872 --> 00:03:34,454
because it's still a little too vague, right?

71
00:03:34,454 --> 00:03:37,496
It doesn't abide by any of the presentation rules.

72
00:03:37,496 --> 00:03:40,378
It's a great thing and it's got its place, absolutely.

73
00:03:40,378 --> 00:03:42,840
But I think it's really easy to get enamored

74
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:46,902
by mood paintings and not ask enough of questions

75
00:03:46,902 --> 00:03:48,483
and misuse your time in pre-production.

76
00:03:49,578 --> 00:03:54,279
So to that end, concepts that pretend to provide answers.

77
00:03:54,279 --> 00:03:56,440
I think everybody's seen these as well.

78
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:58,840
Like you'll do a picture of a building.

79
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,561
A concept artist will make a building, right?

80
00:04:00,561 --> 00:04:03,181
And they're not thinking about what's the step height,

81
00:04:03,181 --> 00:04:05,002
what are the floor heights?

82
00:04:05,002 --> 00:04:06,182
And every time they make a building,

83
00:04:06,182 --> 00:04:07,843
they make it different, right?

84
00:04:07,843 --> 00:04:09,683
That's not answering any questions.

85
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,244
That's not helping you get forward.

86
00:04:11,244 --> 00:04:12,584
That's not helping you build your pipelines.

87
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:14,604
It's not helping you establish rules.

88
00:04:14,604 --> 00:04:17,385
And that's the stuff that you need to focus on

89
00:04:17,385 --> 00:04:18,045
in pre-production.

90
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,260
Also focusing on small self-contained items

91
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:24,420
rather than looking at system work, right?

92
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,741
Like it's great to develop your character

93
00:04:25,741 --> 00:04:27,441
and depending what game you're making,

94
00:04:27,441 --> 00:04:29,162
we make games that are very systems-based.

95
00:04:29,162 --> 00:04:30,862
So like when we look at our characters,

96
00:04:30,862 --> 00:04:32,983
you know, we have isolated ones

97
00:04:32,983 --> 00:04:35,304
and ones that are very heavily reliant on systems.

98
00:04:35,304 --> 00:04:38,405
It's easy to look at them as an example

99
00:04:38,405 --> 00:04:40,285
of just hammering one character,

100
00:04:40,285 --> 00:04:42,346
getting this character perfect.

101
00:04:42,346 --> 00:04:45,367
But by striving for the perfection,

102
00:04:45,367 --> 00:04:47,467
you're not thinking about all the other things

103
00:04:47,467 --> 00:04:49,088
that are gonna eventually affect it, right?

104
00:04:50,842 --> 00:04:54,663
Avoiding difficult gameplay, you know, like not even thinking

105
00:04:54,663 --> 00:04:57,204
about gameplay is something else.

106
00:04:57,204 --> 00:05:00,745
You know, like how is the gameplay going

107
00:05:00,745 --> 00:05:03,346
to actually change how the game is presented

108
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:05,087
and therefore how my game is arted?

109
00:05:05,087 --> 00:05:08,948
And then this is one recently that's kind

110
00:05:08,948 --> 00:05:11,229
of bugged me a little bit that I've heard about.

111
00:05:11,229 --> 00:05:16,290
Getting pushed to have art bibles in pre-production.

112
00:05:16,290 --> 00:05:17,651
You can't possibly do that.

113
00:05:18,457 --> 00:05:21,178
Right, like somebody can argue with me about it,

114
00:05:21,178 --> 00:05:22,399
but I don't see how you do it.

115
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:24,159
You can't make an art bible until you're out

116
00:05:24,159 --> 00:05:26,401
of pre-production and entering production.

117
00:05:26,401 --> 00:05:30,022
At the end of pre-production, then you can address this.

118
00:05:30,022 --> 00:05:32,764
But trying to out of the gate figure out, you know,

119
00:05:32,764 --> 00:05:36,286
what your pipelines are and set limits

120
00:05:36,286 --> 00:05:38,667
is, I think, impossible.

121
00:05:38,667 --> 00:05:44,970
So, now that you got a little bit of idea

122
00:05:44,970 --> 00:05:47,111
of where I'm going with this, Enemy Unknown.

123
00:05:47,111 --> 00:05:47,331
So.

124
00:05:48,588 --> 00:05:56,151
Back in 2007 at Firaxis, we had the opportunity to remake XCOM.

125
00:05:56,151 --> 00:05:58,992
Everybody's ever heard of XCOM from 1994, right?

126
00:05:58,992 --> 00:05:59,633
The really old one?

127
00:05:59,633 --> 00:06:03,735
You know, by all accounts, arguably one

128
00:06:03,735 --> 00:06:06,196
of the best strategy games ever made,

129
00:06:06,196 --> 00:06:08,617
one of the best games ever made.

130
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:11,218
So there's absolutely no pressure, right?

131
00:06:11,218 --> 00:06:14,359
So we had the opportunity to work on this title

132
00:06:14,359 --> 00:06:16,340
and pitch it as something that we wanted to do.

133
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:27,699
So in 2007, as we started this, we were in a really different place for the studio.

134
00:06:27,699 --> 00:06:30,661
The team was pretty tired.

135
00:06:30,661 --> 00:06:35,685
You know, we had been on probably one of our hardest games that we'd ever worked on, and

136
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:43,391
we were coming off of that, and we were sliding into the finish on it sideways.

137
00:06:43,391 --> 00:06:45,152
And so everybody was tired.

138
00:06:46,325 --> 00:06:50,545
All the artists were kind of out of steam.

139
00:06:50,545 --> 00:06:54,526
I had actually been, I'd known for probably about eight months

140
00:06:54,526 --> 00:06:57,447
that I was going to, X-Com was going to be mine.

141
00:06:57,447 --> 00:07:02,608
So, while I was kind of helping out on the other project,

142
00:07:02,608 --> 00:07:06,288
I was stealing time and planning, right?

143
00:07:06,288 --> 00:07:08,089
So, I would talk to the designer about half an hour a day

144
00:07:08,089 --> 00:07:11,069
and we'd kind of figure out what we wanted to do and just talk

145
00:07:11,069 --> 00:07:13,250
through what we thought X-Com would be.

146
00:07:15,119 --> 00:07:18,701
That time was invaluable.

147
00:07:18,701 --> 00:07:23,463
I can't say how good that was for me to get my head on straight

148
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:26,665
and try to filter out all the white noise from everybody

149
00:07:26,665 --> 00:07:28,566
in the studio and everybody around me

150
00:07:28,566 --> 00:07:33,489
that may have hopefully tried to be helpful, made suggestions

151
00:07:33,489 --> 00:07:36,370
about what the game should look like or how it should be.

152
00:07:36,370 --> 00:07:37,891
Because it was just us kind of talking,

153
00:07:37,891 --> 00:07:40,272
didn't really have a lot of that stress.

154
00:07:41,647 --> 00:07:45,369
But when that got done, we had 10 artists and one designer.

155
00:07:45,369 --> 00:07:46,270
We had no programmers.

156
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,311
Programmers were all on fire finishing the other game.

157
00:07:49,311 --> 00:07:52,213
Everybody knows how that works, right?

158
00:07:52,213 --> 00:07:57,696
So we had this opportunity to kind of look at pre-production

159
00:07:57,696 --> 00:07:58,796
from a different perspective.

160
00:07:58,796 --> 00:08:00,117
We'd never gone into pre-production

161
00:08:00,117 --> 00:08:03,159
with just art and a designer, right?

162
00:08:03,159 --> 00:08:06,120
But the important part of that, too, was like we had

163
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,161
to make sure we got the right people on early.

164
00:08:09,342 --> 00:08:12,324
So luckily a lot of the artists had finished

165
00:08:12,324 --> 00:08:16,065
and I was able to get my team together the way I wanted it,

166
00:08:16,065 --> 00:08:20,327
which ironically my team was actually the team I had,

167
00:08:20,327 --> 00:08:23,229
I was art director on Sid Meier's Railroads,

168
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:24,609
where I actually built this team.

169
00:08:24,609 --> 00:08:28,431
And so that same team now came with me,

170
00:08:28,431 --> 00:08:32,513
so it made it real easy for me to know who I wanted where,

171
00:08:32,513 --> 00:08:33,593
because I had two and a half years, three years

172
00:08:33,593 --> 00:08:34,974
of working with these same people.

173
00:08:39,033 --> 00:08:42,155
But we also didn't have any defined requirements

174
00:08:42,155 --> 00:08:45,437
for how we were going to enter production either.

175
00:08:45,437 --> 00:08:48,279
We had no idea where this was going to take us.

176
00:08:48,279 --> 00:08:49,499
We had a block of time to work with.

177
00:08:49,499 --> 00:08:53,742
And we weren't really sure how that was going to work out.

178
00:08:53,742 --> 00:08:58,785
But on top of that, the biggest thing we had,

179
00:08:58,785 --> 00:08:59,566
we didn't have an engine.

180
00:09:00,312 --> 00:09:02,093
We had no idea what we were gonna make this in.

181
00:09:02,093 --> 00:09:04,814
We had a homebrew engine that was designed

182
00:09:04,814 --> 00:09:06,395
for making Civ games, right?

183
00:09:06,395 --> 00:09:09,256
But we were talking about doing something very different.

184
00:09:09,256 --> 00:09:12,257
And we also didn't have any contemporary games

185
00:09:12,257 --> 00:09:13,098
to compare to.

186
00:09:13,098 --> 00:09:16,739
I mean, the game we were looking at was a game from 1994.

187
00:09:16,739 --> 00:09:19,661
That's a pretty big jump.

188
00:09:19,661 --> 00:09:25,883
And so those are two big issues that really

189
00:09:25,883 --> 00:09:29,345
had us confused about how we wanted to go at first.

190
00:09:31,476 --> 00:09:33,017
So, our approach.

191
00:09:33,017 --> 00:09:37,319
This is one of the earliest screenshots

192
00:09:37,319 --> 00:09:41,060
of us kind of figuring out pre-production.

193
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:46,023
We decided that we were going to actually make a gameplay simulation.

194
00:09:46,023 --> 00:09:49,985
And so, the first thing I did was I went out

195
00:09:49,985 --> 00:09:52,206
and I made sure I had the right concept people.

196
00:09:52,206 --> 00:09:54,527
Like, I actually went out and found a concept artist.

197
00:09:54,527 --> 00:09:56,908
His work is littered through here, Pierre McGowan.

198
00:09:58,362 --> 00:10:00,444
But, you know, he did an amazing job.

199
00:10:00,444 --> 00:10:03,307
But the thing was we were trying to figure out, like,

200
00:10:03,307 --> 00:10:04,929
you couldn't just put anybody in this job.

201
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:06,570
The person that filled the concept role

202
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,032
was the heart of your project, right?

203
00:10:08,032 --> 00:10:10,875
So they have to be perfect for what they're doing.

204
00:10:10,875 --> 00:10:13,638
You have to be more selective about the concept artist

205
00:10:13,638 --> 00:10:15,039
than anybody else on the team in that sense.

206
00:10:16,648 --> 00:10:18,589
We wanted to simulate gameplay, right?

207
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:20,690
Like that was super important to us.

208
00:10:20,690 --> 00:10:22,991
We didn't want this to turn into a sizzle reel.

209
00:10:22,991 --> 00:10:24,592
We didn't want it to turn into a trailer.

210
00:10:24,592 --> 00:10:28,093
And multiple times, there were people

211
00:10:28,093 --> 00:10:29,274
that suggested us going that route.

212
00:10:29,274 --> 00:10:31,214
And so we really held our guns.

213
00:10:31,214 --> 00:10:32,375
We wanted to fake the UI.

214
00:10:32,375 --> 00:10:33,235
We wanted to make it feel

215
00:10:33,235 --> 00:10:36,697
like you were experiencing the game.

216
00:10:36,697 --> 00:10:42,499
And so to that end, we jumped on to using 3D Studio Max.

217
00:10:42,499 --> 00:10:44,840
For us, we were using 3D Studio Max.

218
00:10:46,283 --> 00:10:49,566
Since we didn't have an engine, that was what we knew the most.

219
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,989
And we felt like that gave us the agility

220
00:10:51,989 --> 00:10:54,892
to move around and iterate quickly,

221
00:10:54,892 --> 00:10:57,654
figure out what didn't work fast, get rid of it,

222
00:10:57,654 --> 00:11:00,257
change the cameras, re-render.

223
00:11:00,257 --> 00:11:03,700
It really removed any technology limitations we had.

224
00:11:03,700 --> 00:11:06,764
And the whole idea was, what do we want it to be,

225
00:11:06,764 --> 00:11:08,806
and not how do we work within a box, right?

226
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:09,667
Other than the gameplay.

227
00:11:11,390 --> 00:11:14,231
And then we questioned everything.

228
00:11:14,231 --> 00:11:17,552
With an XCOM game, why is the camera here?

229
00:11:17,552 --> 00:11:19,874
Is it because that's the best answer,

230
00:11:19,874 --> 00:11:21,474
or because that was the best answer in 1994?

231
00:11:21,474 --> 00:11:27,077
And so we started questioning what was good,

232
00:11:27,077 --> 00:11:28,717
what was bad, deconstructing it.

233
00:11:28,717 --> 00:11:31,419
There were a lot of really good decisions that we kept,

234
00:11:31,419 --> 00:11:33,299
a lot of decisions we thought we could improve on

235
00:11:33,299 --> 00:11:34,700
because technology had advanced so much

236
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:36,501
in the 17-year gap, or whatever it was.

237
00:11:38,009 --> 00:11:40,050
And then we set project goals.

238
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:42,310
And this is something that, you know,

239
00:11:42,310 --> 00:11:45,751
when I first did that, I wasn't so sure, right?

240
00:11:45,751 --> 00:11:47,151
Project goals, eh.

241
00:11:47,151 --> 00:11:51,172
They just seemed kinda contrived and weird.

242
00:11:51,172 --> 00:11:53,693
And they weren't tangible things,

243
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:55,273
typically when I've heard about these things.

244
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:59,154
And so for us, you know, we set out as a team,

245
00:11:59,154 --> 00:12:00,695
10 artists sitting in a room,

246
00:12:00,695 --> 00:12:02,775
first day that they're in the room,

247
00:12:02,775 --> 00:12:03,395
right on the wall.

248
00:12:04,132 --> 00:12:07,213
We wanted to get best in show at E3.

249
00:12:07,213 --> 00:12:10,494
Not just strategy, we wanted to get best in show.

250
00:12:10,494 --> 00:12:12,895
We wanted to surprise the publisher.

251
00:12:12,895 --> 00:12:13,475
That was another one.

252
00:12:13,475 --> 00:12:16,877
And then we wanted to get game of the year.

253
00:12:16,877 --> 00:12:18,177
Again, not strategy game.

254
00:12:18,177 --> 00:12:21,438
We wanted to go for, take a turn-based strategy game

255
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:25,040
on consoles, sounds crazy, and get game of the year.

256
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,961
But these were the goals we set out with day one.

257
00:12:27,961 --> 00:12:32,162
So getting to day one, talking about finishing

258
00:12:32,162 --> 00:12:33,103
that other project, right?

259
00:12:34,737 --> 00:12:37,819
This is how a typical development cycle works, right?

260
00:12:37,819 --> 00:12:41,381
You ship the game, and for every up, there's a down.

261
00:12:41,381 --> 00:12:43,823
And that down is the problem.

262
00:12:43,823 --> 00:12:46,785
That down kills you, because re-inflating a team

263
00:12:46,785 --> 00:12:49,706
is so much harder than just maintaining the team.

264
00:12:49,706 --> 00:12:53,729
So again, you start the project, you finish it,

265
00:12:53,729 --> 00:12:55,350
everybody's completely exhausted,

266
00:12:55,350 --> 00:12:57,171
nobody's done laundry, you've got

267
00:12:57,171 --> 00:12:59,553
to repair all your relationship with your family,

268
00:12:59,553 --> 00:13:00,693
call your mom and dad.

269
00:13:01,099 --> 00:13:04,662
I see your wife once in a while.

270
00:13:04,662 --> 00:13:08,284
But so then you've got this bottom out where the project starts, and that's not how you

271
00:13:08,284 --> 00:13:09,825
want to start a project.

272
00:13:09,825 --> 00:13:12,187
For us, this is where we want to be.

273
00:13:12,187 --> 00:13:16,470
So again, I'm kind of loosely helping out on another project as we're doing this, and

274
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:19,492
I'm thinking about how can I keep my guys from bottoming out?

275
00:13:19,492 --> 00:13:24,635
I want them to day one be excited about what they're doing.

276
00:13:24,635 --> 00:13:25,656
So I started planning for the team.

277
00:13:26,744 --> 00:13:28,944
You know, again, I identified the key positions

278
00:13:28,944 --> 00:13:30,085
and the people that I needed.

279
00:13:30,085 --> 00:13:32,825
I got the 10 guys that I needed to make this thing.

280
00:13:32,825 --> 00:13:33,825
No more, no less.

281
00:13:33,825 --> 00:13:35,686
These are the 10 guys I need.

282
00:13:35,686 --> 00:13:37,246
I needed a concept artist.

283
00:13:37,246 --> 00:13:39,346
I needed a modeler.

284
00:13:39,346 --> 00:13:40,847
I needed a character artist.

285
00:13:40,847 --> 00:13:42,327
I needed a couple animators.

286
00:13:42,327 --> 00:13:45,067
I needed an effects guy, right?

287
00:13:45,067 --> 00:13:46,168
Should have had a tech artist,

288
00:13:46,168 --> 00:13:48,728
but we didn't have one at the time.

289
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:53,069
But, so we went after those people that we needed.

290
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:53,989
We made sure I had them.

291
00:13:54,962 --> 00:13:57,565
I collected concepts in that eight-month period, right?

292
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:58,606
I was constantly working.

293
00:13:58,606 --> 00:14:02,029
I went and got an outsource budget.

294
00:14:02,029 --> 00:14:04,151
Let me go start collecting concepts.

295
00:14:04,151 --> 00:14:08,795
I actually hired our concept guy as a contractor.

296
00:14:09,935 --> 00:14:12,657
before I could get a position approved for him in the studio.

297
00:14:12,657 --> 00:14:14,218
So I was paying him to make concepts,

298
00:14:14,218 --> 00:14:15,979
and I was outsourcing to another guy

299
00:14:15,979 --> 00:14:18,440
just so I could get my feet on the ground

300
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:19,821
before the team hit the ground.

301
00:14:19,821 --> 00:14:21,482
I don't know if anybody's had that problem

302
00:14:21,482 --> 00:14:23,404
where your team just starts the day that you start,

303
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,246
and it's like, hey, go make pre-production, right?

304
00:14:26,246 --> 00:14:30,368
I'm betting a lot of people have had that, right?

305
00:14:30,368 --> 00:14:31,849
Somebody, not just me, come on.

306
00:14:33,487 --> 00:14:37,009
So I was consciously building my team, right,

307
00:14:37,009 --> 00:14:37,990
in this whole process.

308
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,592
One of the more controversial things I did

309
00:14:40,592 --> 00:14:42,694
was actually isolated my team in a room.

310
00:14:42,694 --> 00:14:45,376
I booked a conference room.

311
00:14:45,376 --> 00:14:50,700
I went out and got brand new computers for everybody.

312
00:14:50,700 --> 00:14:52,802
They walked in, day one, everybody

313
00:14:52,802 --> 00:14:56,765
had a new computer with a concept, ready to go.

314
00:14:56,765 --> 00:14:59,987
And that was super important.

315
00:14:59,987 --> 00:15:00,908
It was a fresh start.

316
00:15:01,939 --> 00:15:08,981
By isolating the guys in a room, there were so many reasons to do that from a management

317
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:09,601
level, right?

318
00:15:09,601 --> 00:15:13,423
Like, you know, I had 10 artists, I had no programmers.

319
00:15:13,423 --> 00:15:16,484
I wanted these guys to believe that they can make anything.

320
00:15:16,484 --> 00:15:18,004
I wanted to empower them.

321
00:15:18,004 --> 00:15:21,985
It created a little bit of a mystique to the team because I kept everyone out.

322
00:15:21,985 --> 00:15:25,527
Not only were they in that room together, no one saw what we were working on.

323
00:15:26,553 --> 00:15:29,254
And it's crazy, and it wasn't me trying to be a jerk.

324
00:15:29,254 --> 00:15:32,735
It was me, I needed to filter out the white noise, right?

325
00:15:32,735 --> 00:15:36,656
I didn't want anybody, you know, critiquing a sectoid

326
00:15:36,656 --> 00:15:40,197
before I had figured out what a soldier looked like too

327
00:15:40,197 --> 00:15:41,197
and what the terrain looked like.

328
00:15:41,197 --> 00:15:43,618
And I just didn't want that.

329
00:15:43,618 --> 00:15:46,358
And then on top of it, I didn't want anybody

330
00:15:46,358 --> 00:15:49,099
also kind of hammering my team on it either

331
00:15:49,099 --> 00:15:49,779
when I'm not around.

332
00:15:49,779 --> 00:15:52,120
And not that anybody do that.

333
00:15:53,141 --> 00:15:54,622
It just happens in development.

334
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:57,485
Everybody wants to be part of it, so people start talking.

335
00:15:57,485 --> 00:15:58,526
So we kind of filtered that out.

336
00:15:58,526 --> 00:15:59,687
And then the biggest thing, though,

337
00:15:59,687 --> 00:16:05,252
was I used the rest of the studio as my litmus test

338
00:16:05,252 --> 00:16:07,174
for whether or not this game was going to be cool.

339
00:16:07,174 --> 00:16:09,897
When they saw it, it was going to be the first time

340
00:16:09,897 --> 00:16:10,897
anybody had seen it.

341
00:16:10,897 --> 00:16:12,859
And that was a huge role for us.

342
00:16:12,859 --> 00:16:15,702
They played a significant part in the process.

343
00:16:17,797 --> 00:16:21,660
And then the other thing about being in the room together was that it established this

344
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:22,200
critique tone.

345
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,183
Like we had guys that were super extroverted and guys that were super introverted and they

346
00:16:26,183 --> 00:16:27,324
were sitting right next to each other.

347
00:16:27,324 --> 00:16:34,290
And over a period of the four months that we worked on this, because day one to end

348
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:35,070
was four months.

349
00:16:38,144 --> 00:16:39,605
you watch the guys who were introverted

350
00:16:39,605 --> 00:16:40,946
just kind of start coming out of their shell,

351
00:16:40,946 --> 00:16:43,087
and they'd start talking about their work.

352
00:16:43,087 --> 00:16:47,369
And the honesty in the discussion about what the work was,

353
00:16:47,369 --> 00:16:49,470
A, they all felt empowered to talk to each other

354
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,571
about their work, because they were all in a room together,

355
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:53,252
they couldn't avoid it.

356
00:16:53,252 --> 00:16:57,214
But you also started to see the team chemistry change,

357
00:16:57,214 --> 00:16:59,315
that guys who were in individual offices before

358
00:16:59,315 --> 00:17:00,796
and would just hide in there.

359
00:17:01,790 --> 00:17:02,950
were now unable to do that.

360
00:17:02,950 --> 00:17:05,411
And so they were communicating back and forth

361
00:17:05,411 --> 00:17:08,072
in a way that was completely new.

362
00:17:08,072 --> 00:17:10,913
You read all that stuff about in management books

363
00:17:10,913 --> 00:17:14,294
about level four communication, right?

364
00:17:14,294 --> 00:17:15,134
Like honesty.

365
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:16,194
We truly achieved that.

366
00:17:16,194 --> 00:17:18,955
Like these guys had no problem talking to each other

367
00:17:18,955 --> 00:17:20,256
about what was right and wrong.

368
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:23,137
And that was enormous when starting a project.

369
00:17:23,137 --> 00:17:26,558
And so that feeds into achieving buy-in.

370
00:17:26,558 --> 00:17:28,658
They all felt empowered, right?

371
00:17:28,658 --> 00:17:29,739
Everybody could affect change.

372
00:17:32,846 --> 00:17:35,947
And on top of that, I was trying to provide concepts

373
00:17:35,947 --> 00:17:38,367
that challenged their skills, challenged

374
00:17:38,367 --> 00:17:40,048
them to step to the next level.

375
00:17:40,048 --> 00:17:42,048
And every time I did it, they met it and crushed it.

376
00:17:42,048 --> 00:17:45,369
The achieving buy-in is the easy part.

377
00:17:45,369 --> 00:17:48,450
The maintaining buy-in is the hard part, right?

378
00:17:48,450 --> 00:17:50,311
And this is what gets hard about making games.

379
00:17:50,311 --> 00:17:51,871
But even during pre-production, you

380
00:17:51,871 --> 00:17:54,372
had to find these little points to kind of buoy the team,

381
00:17:54,372 --> 00:17:57,492
keep them believing in what you're doing.

382
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,133
Because if any one guy in this process,

383
00:17:59,133 --> 00:18:00,933
as I've thought about this now.

384
00:18:01,860 --> 00:18:05,084
you know, 10 years of looking back on it.

385
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,347
If any one guy in this group of people in that room

386
00:18:07,347 --> 00:18:10,570
doesn't believe in what I'm doing, it doesn't happen.

387
00:18:10,570 --> 00:18:11,431
So this is the room, believe it or not.

388
00:18:11,431 --> 00:18:17,278
And this is one of those kind of buoying moments.

389
00:18:17,278 --> 00:18:19,801
We were actually, if you notice,

390
00:18:19,801 --> 00:18:22,124
there's old Xcom in the background.

391
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:26,335
the original game, and guys are learning about the game they're playing,

392
00:18:26,335 --> 00:18:30,118
because we're remaking, because again, a lot of these guys never played it,

393
00:18:30,118 --> 00:18:32,359
because they were too young.

394
00:18:32,359 --> 00:18:37,924
And so we're learning about the old game while we're making the new game,

395
00:18:37,924 --> 00:18:39,865
and trying to make sure that was fresh in everybody's mind.

396
00:18:39,865 --> 00:18:43,709
And you can see the designers in there.

397
00:18:43,709 --> 00:18:46,231
He's standing there, you know, looking at what the guys are doing,

398
00:18:46,231 --> 00:18:50,454
talking to them about how the game works, which was a great experience.

399
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:51,995
That room got so hot, it was ridiculous.

400
00:18:53,131 --> 00:18:56,712
There was no air conditioning and it was winter

401
00:18:56,712 --> 00:18:59,273
and all those computers and monitors, it was ridiculous.

402
00:18:59,273 --> 00:19:03,115
So some of the questions that we had,

403
00:19:03,115 --> 00:19:04,775
you know, what was the theme of the game?

404
00:19:04,775 --> 00:19:06,456
What's the setting of the game?

405
00:19:06,456 --> 00:19:08,957
How do we, what are design goals?

406
00:19:08,957 --> 00:19:09,897
How do those affect art?

407
00:19:09,897 --> 00:19:11,358
You know, where is the camera?

408
00:19:11,358 --> 00:19:12,498
What do we have to communicate?

409
00:19:12,498 --> 00:19:17,000
Where is all that stuff gonna be?

410
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:18,380
What is important to the designer?

411
00:19:19,372 --> 00:19:21,013
And then what are the visual opportunities?

412
00:19:21,013 --> 00:19:22,234
Again, can we drop a camera down?

413
00:19:22,234 --> 00:19:23,535
Can we create immersion points?

414
00:19:23,535 --> 00:19:26,018
Can you even push those further?

415
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:27,159
Do they interrupt the gameplay?

416
00:19:27,159 --> 00:19:28,720
How fast do they have to be?

417
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,345
We were able to change these things on the fly.

418
00:19:33,345 --> 00:19:37,248
If the run cycle was too long, speed it up.

419
00:19:37,248 --> 00:19:39,570
Because we're working in a platform

420
00:19:39,570 --> 00:19:40,852
that was very easy for us.

421
00:19:42,406 --> 00:19:45,067
And then setting up our pipelines, working large to small.

422
00:19:45,067 --> 00:19:47,147
What's your largest creature?

423
00:19:47,147 --> 00:19:48,927
What's your smallest creature?

424
00:19:48,927 --> 00:19:49,968
Make sure you include them,

425
00:19:49,968 --> 00:19:53,548
because they're your bookends.

426
00:19:53,548 --> 00:19:55,069
And then looking at the terrain,

427
00:19:55,069 --> 00:19:57,129
looking at the buildings, working in,

428
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:59,870
asking the right questions about what's important,

429
00:19:59,870 --> 00:20:01,010
what's gonna need to be solved,

430
00:20:01,010 --> 00:20:02,050
and attacking it from that perspective.

431
00:20:02,050 --> 00:20:03,791
So our first answers.

432
00:20:03,791 --> 00:20:06,511
This is the first concept from XCOM.

433
00:20:07,380 --> 00:20:09,581
Again, we're trying to establish our mood.

434
00:20:09,581 --> 00:20:11,602
We're trying to figure out what's the tone of this game.

435
00:20:11,602 --> 00:20:14,864
Again, we wanted to use a lot of things

436
00:20:14,864 --> 00:20:17,145
that had a context to people.

437
00:20:17,145 --> 00:20:18,426
But then we wanted to give them a twist.

438
00:20:18,426 --> 00:20:20,307
And so you can see this farmhouse

439
00:20:20,307 --> 00:20:21,308
is recognizable to everyone, right?

440
00:20:21,308 --> 00:20:22,809
Resonates with everybody.

441
00:20:22,809 --> 00:20:25,050
But you've got these weird soldiers in the foreground

442
00:20:25,050 --> 00:20:26,931
and you've got this crazy orange and greenish light

443
00:20:26,931 --> 00:20:30,713
in the background coming out of one of the windows.

444
00:20:30,713 --> 00:20:32,754
We wanted to have that unsettling kind of feel.

445
00:20:32,754 --> 00:20:35,436
This was also, we did two of these and we moved on.

446
00:20:36,625 --> 00:20:38,347
Right? And this is before I had the team.

447
00:20:38,347 --> 00:20:39,869
We had two of them, moved on.

448
00:20:39,869 --> 00:20:41,812
This is the little gray.

449
00:20:41,812 --> 00:20:42,573
This is sectoid.

450
00:20:42,573 --> 00:20:45,556
Everybody knows what one of these looks like,

451
00:20:45,556 --> 00:20:47,559
but redesigning one is actually kind of hard.

452
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,582
Because everybody does know what they look like.

453
00:20:50,582 --> 00:20:52,324
So doing a new take on it was tough.

454
00:20:53,011 --> 00:20:54,752
But this is our smallest character in the game.

455
00:20:54,752 --> 00:20:56,433
And this is our largest.

456
00:20:56,433 --> 00:20:57,573
This was the sectopod.

457
00:20:57,573 --> 00:21:00,735
This is the early incarnation of it.

458
00:21:00,735 --> 00:21:03,737
He's 30 feet tall, the sectoid is four.

459
00:21:03,737 --> 00:21:05,358
And we had to get them both on the screen.

460
00:21:05,358 --> 00:21:07,599
I remember us sliding them around at max.

461
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,460
Can you still play the game with the designer?

462
00:21:09,460 --> 00:21:11,041
Can you still play the game from this perspective?

463
00:21:13,088 --> 00:21:15,450
And from there, we had started attacking the presentation.

464
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:17,232
Like I was saying, where is the camera?

465
00:21:17,232 --> 00:21:18,453
Can you play the game from here?

466
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:20,255
We looked at all these little vignettes

467
00:21:20,255 --> 00:21:21,817
and then started moving the camera around.

468
00:21:21,817 --> 00:21:23,118
What happens when you go in buildings?

469
00:21:23,118 --> 00:21:24,820
Does it get, does the camera push in?

470
00:21:24,820 --> 00:21:26,922
Does it get more claustrophobic?

471
00:21:26,922 --> 00:21:29,385
Can we pitch the camera a little differently?

472
00:21:29,385 --> 00:21:32,608
This little study of nine drawings was huge for us.

473
00:21:32,608 --> 00:21:35,251
And then we took that and we translated it.

474
00:21:35,924 --> 00:21:39,767
Right? This is actually built to standards that we were going

475
00:21:39,767 --> 00:21:41,369
to model with, like we were trying to figure

476
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,189
out what those were.

477
00:21:42,189 --> 00:21:44,631
And then we sent it back into concept to,

478
00:21:44,631 --> 00:21:47,013
this is our farmhouse, hit it.

479
00:21:47,013 --> 00:21:47,974
How does this work?

480
00:21:47,974 --> 00:21:51,677
So, like I said about the little room we're in,

481
00:21:51,677 --> 00:21:53,139
this is the first day.

482
00:21:53,139 --> 00:21:56,321
You can see the date on the wall.

483
00:21:56,321 --> 00:21:57,022
My chicken scratch on there.

484
00:21:57,022 --> 00:21:58,363
And these are our goals.

485
00:21:58,363 --> 00:22:02,106
And I'll get to these goals in a minute.

486
00:22:02,798 --> 00:22:05,241
But it was important that we identified all this stuff.

487
00:22:05,241 --> 00:22:07,283
What are our immersion points?

488
00:22:07,283 --> 00:22:09,445
What are the goals for each section

489
00:22:09,445 --> 00:22:12,788
of this little gameplay movie that we're gonna make?

490
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:15,010
And if you look at it, these are the storyboards,

491
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,472
which actually relate pretty closely

492
00:22:16,472 --> 00:22:18,554
to the previous movie we made.

493
00:22:18,554 --> 00:22:19,895
All the little red images

494
00:22:19,895 --> 00:22:21,276
are actually the immersion points.

495
00:22:21,276 --> 00:22:22,177
These are the points where we thought

496
00:22:22,177 --> 00:22:23,999
we had visual opportunities to drop the camera down.

497
00:22:25,056 --> 00:22:28,678
Where can we make a typically non-immersive game

498
00:22:28,678 --> 00:22:32,701
really immersive and enhance the game design

499
00:22:32,701 --> 00:22:33,581
rather than take it away?

500
00:22:33,581 --> 00:22:37,223
So that leads us to the previous movie.

501
00:22:37,223 --> 00:22:37,904
And this is what we made.

502
00:23:15,031 --> 00:23:23,383
We definitely got a situation.

503
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:37,741
So I think one of the important things about that video

504
00:25:37,741 --> 00:25:40,823
is that we were really trying to capture

505
00:25:40,823 --> 00:25:42,124
kind of how you feel about your characters

506
00:25:42,124 --> 00:25:44,966
and that little like narrative story that happens

507
00:25:44,966 --> 00:25:46,747
in the game when you play it,

508
00:25:46,747 --> 00:25:49,149
when you play and all it's about your soldiers.

509
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:53,092
And so each time we do one of these things,

510
00:25:53,092 --> 00:25:53,752
that is our thrust.

511
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:56,354
It wasn't really the intention,

512
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:58,195
but it kind of works out that way.

513
00:25:58,195 --> 00:26:03,299
And there's something really satisfying about that.

514
00:26:03,299 --> 00:26:03,499
And so.

515
00:26:04,658 --> 00:26:07,099
That'll come up later, I'm gonna mention that in a bit.

516
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:09,960
But what we missed when we were planning this,

517
00:26:09,960 --> 00:26:11,480
so everything you just saw in that,

518
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:14,241
all those goals on the board,

519
00:26:14,241 --> 00:26:15,581
we got really close to those,

520
00:26:15,581 --> 00:26:16,542
but a couple of things we missed.

521
00:26:16,542 --> 00:26:20,403
And this is important too.

522
00:26:20,403 --> 00:26:22,523
We didn't think about how the floor was gonna transition.

523
00:26:22,523 --> 00:26:26,684
The only point in that movie that's utter magic,

524
00:26:26,684 --> 00:26:29,385
where we're not adhering to the rules,

525
00:26:29,385 --> 00:26:30,806
is when the floor transition happens,

526
00:26:30,806 --> 00:26:32,086
if you notice we faded to black.

527
00:26:33,078 --> 00:26:33,919
We got to that and we were like,

528
00:26:33,919 --> 00:26:35,119
we don't know how we're gonna handle this,

529
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,440
because it's a tech solution as well.

530
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:38,202
And it was just 10 artists in a room.

531
00:26:38,202 --> 00:26:40,924
And so we took a note of that.

532
00:26:40,924 --> 00:26:43,526
We knew we didn't have an answer for it,

533
00:26:43,526 --> 00:26:44,807
and we continued to move on.

534
00:26:44,807 --> 00:26:47,008
We could have gotten bogged down there, we didn't.

535
00:26:47,008 --> 00:26:51,172
But it was also important to have found that question then,

536
00:26:51,172 --> 00:26:54,114
and not find it out eight months later.

537
00:26:54,114 --> 00:26:56,796
And so one of the other things we didn't really know

538
00:26:56,796 --> 00:26:59,358
how we were going to solve was the interior fog of war.

539
00:26:59,663 --> 00:27:01,925
between buildings, inside of buildings,

540
00:27:01,925 --> 00:27:03,686
how do the rooms work, right?

541
00:27:03,686 --> 00:27:08,149
Or exterior fog of war, we at the end,

542
00:27:08,149 --> 00:27:09,930
we just kind of like, we put fog of war in there,

543
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,651
but we didn't, if you notice, it doesn't reveal.

544
00:27:11,651 --> 00:27:15,354
Again, we knew we didn't have an answer for these.

545
00:27:15,354 --> 00:27:16,775
We made notes of them,

546
00:27:16,775 --> 00:27:18,916
and the next thing we did was that drawing.

547
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:25,042
which is pretty close to how our building hiding works now,

548
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:26,542
even in X2, it's pretty much the same thing.

549
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:30,764
But this was immediately, as soon as we finished that movie,

550
00:27:30,764 --> 00:27:32,944
concept went right in.

551
00:27:32,944 --> 00:27:34,125
We know we have a problem here.

552
00:27:34,125 --> 00:27:35,665
How do we wanna solve this?

553
00:27:35,665 --> 00:27:37,886
And then we sent it over to the graphics programmers,

554
00:27:37,886 --> 00:27:38,626
this is what we wanna make.

555
00:27:40,778 --> 00:27:43,219
And then Fog of War, we played around with some stuff.

556
00:27:43,219 --> 00:27:47,741
At this point, it was actually a physical thing.

557
00:27:47,741 --> 00:27:50,302
And that had some gameplay issues.

558
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,182
So we went to a more traditional Fog of War.

559
00:27:52,182 --> 00:27:54,383
But again, we didn't want it to be black.

560
00:27:54,383 --> 00:27:55,643
We wanted it to have color.

561
00:27:55,643 --> 00:27:58,764
We didn't want the screen to get all the light being sucked out

562
00:27:58,764 --> 00:28:00,125
of it by the blackness of it.

563
00:28:00,125 --> 00:28:04,046
And so we were trying to get a Fog of War that

564
00:28:04,046 --> 00:28:07,327
was complementary to the light environment.

565
00:28:08,733 --> 00:28:11,115
And even though it didn't end up looking like this,

566
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:12,796
this is kind of the final result

567
00:28:12,796 --> 00:28:14,517
ended up being more like that.

568
00:28:14,517 --> 00:28:16,719
So back to our goals that we had on the wall,

569
00:28:16,719 --> 00:28:19,341
the things that we wrote down the very first day,

570
00:28:19,341 --> 00:28:21,782
everything up there we hit in blue.

571
00:28:21,782 --> 00:28:23,944
The red thing we knew we probably couldn't do,

572
00:28:23,944 --> 00:28:24,684
but we were trying to figure out

573
00:28:24,684 --> 00:28:27,547
how we could maybe get multiple shadows.

574
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:32,752
And then effects and destructible interior

575
00:28:32,752 --> 00:28:37,935
and exterior, we had in the movie,

576
00:28:37,935 --> 00:28:39,836
but they weren't necessarily gameplay compliant.

577
00:28:39,836 --> 00:28:42,337
We knew we still had to solve those.

578
00:28:42,337 --> 00:28:43,898
But we did pretty good considering

579
00:28:43,898 --> 00:28:44,378
that was our initial list.

580
00:28:44,378 --> 00:28:49,882
And so this came out of it as well.

581
00:28:49,882 --> 00:28:51,943
Like I said, we needed to not just draw a picture

582
00:28:51,943 --> 00:28:53,323
of a farmhouse.

583
00:28:53,323 --> 00:28:54,964
What were the step heights going to be?

584
00:28:54,964 --> 00:28:56,125
What were the railings going to be?

585
00:28:56,682 --> 00:28:58,124
What were the walls going to be?

586
00:28:58,124 --> 00:29:01,868
What were the, how were the walls going to work on the grid?

587
00:29:01,868 --> 00:29:05,212
You know, is there a grid?

588
00:29:05,212 --> 00:29:07,635
You know, what is the wall height going to be?

589
00:29:07,635 --> 00:29:08,315
Door heights?

590
00:29:08,315 --> 00:29:10,258
Window openings?

591
00:29:10,258 --> 00:29:11,059
All that.

592
00:29:11,059 --> 00:29:13,201
And the funniest thing about this is that

593
00:29:13,642 --> 00:29:16,422
This document was made about 10 years ago

594
00:29:16,422 --> 00:29:19,563
and these metrics are pretty much the same metrics

595
00:29:19,563 --> 00:29:23,304
we use in XCOM 2 and have just been kind

596
00:29:23,304 --> 00:29:25,805
of enhanced a little bit more now.

597
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:29,226
But these are the same exact measurements for the most part.

598
00:29:29,226 --> 00:29:34,508
So one of the other things that came out of the previs,

599
00:29:34,508 --> 00:29:36,548
if you notice I was probably more concerned.

600
00:29:37,478 --> 00:29:39,840
with the presentation than necessarily the aesthetics.

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:43,141
I feel like we were kind of in the ballpark on the aesthetics,

602
00:29:43,141 --> 00:29:45,562
but my primary goal was what was the presentation.

603
00:29:45,562 --> 00:29:47,883
And this was the concept of the soldiers

604
00:29:47,883 --> 00:29:49,224
when we rolled into that.

605
00:29:49,224 --> 00:29:51,865
But again, once we made it, readability came into play.

606
00:29:51,865 --> 00:29:54,486
And we were like, can you really read things?

607
00:29:54,486 --> 00:29:57,768
Does it hold up in both cameras, right?

608
00:29:57,768 --> 00:29:59,329
And so that set us down a row where

609
00:29:59,329 --> 00:30:02,090
we wanted to try to mess with the proportions.

610
00:30:02,090 --> 00:30:03,911
And this is where the miniature thing really came in.

611
00:30:03,911 --> 00:30:07,072
And the guy on the right is.

612
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:10,594
that we ended up shipping in the game for the soldiers,

613
00:30:10,594 --> 00:30:14,618
but we got much more broad, much more chunky.

614
00:30:14,618 --> 00:30:16,380
And we did this for readability reason.

615
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:18,603
You know, we wanted to read in both cameras

616
00:30:18,603 --> 00:30:21,967
and trying to balance those two things out.

617
00:30:21,967 --> 00:30:24,550
Another thing, you know, our first Potter reveal,

618
00:30:24,550 --> 00:30:26,933
the first time you see an alien was in the movie.

619
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:28,054
This is what shipped in the game.

620
00:30:30,372 --> 00:30:32,774
We wanted to set up the missions.

621
00:30:32,774 --> 00:30:34,335
This was a big thing for us.

622
00:30:34,335 --> 00:30:37,918
We wanted to establish some tone before you went in

623
00:30:37,918 --> 00:30:42,801
and started blowing things up, right?

624
00:30:42,801 --> 00:30:45,083
We had the dropship come in, in every mission,

625
00:30:45,083 --> 00:30:48,446
and guys exiting, and you got to feel

626
00:30:48,446 --> 00:30:49,246
for the flavor of the map.

627
00:30:49,246 --> 00:30:54,670
This is the gameplay camera in the movie,

628
00:30:54,670 --> 00:30:57,312
and this is what we shipped with.

629
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:01,961
So we had established where all these cameras were going to be,

630
00:31:01,961 --> 00:31:04,021
and those pretty much stuck.

631
00:31:04,021 --> 00:31:05,001
The significant cameras stuck.

632
00:31:05,001 --> 00:31:08,502
And then some of the intangible results,

633
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:11,022
the things that we ended up getting out of that movie

634
00:31:11,022 --> 00:31:13,503
that we really weren't planning on,

635
00:31:13,503 --> 00:31:15,623
a huge morale increase for the team.

636
00:31:15,623 --> 00:31:17,644
And I'm not just talking about the 10 guys in that room.

637
00:31:17,644 --> 00:31:19,704
And I'm not just talking about the XCOM team.

638
00:31:19,704 --> 00:31:24,245
The whole studio, the morale increase in the studio

639
00:31:24,245 --> 00:31:24,985
was crazy.

640
00:31:24,985 --> 00:31:27,265
We'd never put together anything like this.

641
00:31:28,438 --> 00:31:31,700
You know, it was our art bible for a long time.

642
00:31:31,700 --> 00:31:32,921
It was our constitution.

643
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:34,683
This was how we wanted the game to look.

644
00:31:34,683 --> 00:31:36,604
Anytime anybody didn't know how something

645
00:31:36,604 --> 00:31:38,205
was supposed to look, we said, go look at the movie.

646
00:31:38,205 --> 00:31:39,746
How's that supposed to work?

647
00:31:39,746 --> 00:31:40,707
Go look at the movie.

648
00:31:40,707 --> 00:31:42,408
And in fact, we would check the movie,

649
00:31:42,408 --> 00:31:44,250
be like, okay, this is how it's supposed to be, right?

650
00:31:44,250 --> 00:31:45,551
And we'd double check it.

651
00:31:45,551 --> 00:31:48,333
It ended up being a recruiting tool for us.

652
00:31:48,333 --> 00:31:50,254
We went for so long without being announced

653
00:31:50,254 --> 00:31:53,357
that it was hard, but when we'd bring people in

654
00:31:53,357 --> 00:31:54,658
and say, this is the game we're making.

655
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:59,197
it was easy to then hire people.

656
00:31:59,197 --> 00:32:02,660
And then it also ended up being an internal marketing tool,

657
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:04,542
not just with us, but at the publisher,

658
00:32:04,542 --> 00:32:07,545
it ended up being what we pitched to get the game,

659
00:32:07,545 --> 00:32:08,105
to get the IP.

660
00:32:08,105 --> 00:32:13,951
So, we made a prototype after that,

661
00:32:13,951 --> 00:32:14,071
and

662
00:32:15,048 --> 00:32:16,610
It was missing that soldier story stuff

663
00:32:16,610 --> 00:32:17,831
that I was talking about.

664
00:32:17,831 --> 00:32:20,495
It was missing some of the immersion.

665
00:32:20,495 --> 00:32:23,559
Didn't have the feel of that previs movie.

666
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:26,543
So again, we went back to what we could do fast.

667
00:32:26,543 --> 00:32:27,504
What could we be agile about?

668
00:32:27,504 --> 00:32:29,426
What could we move quickly on?

669
00:32:30,421 --> 00:32:33,322
And we ended up making another Previs movie.

670
00:32:33,322 --> 00:32:35,222
And this time, it's an engine.

671
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:37,342
Again, at this point, we're over.

672
00:32:37,342 --> 00:32:38,743
We've got our style set.

673
00:32:38,743 --> 00:32:40,343
We've got our characters worked out.

674
00:32:40,343 --> 00:32:41,903
We understand our proportions.

675
00:32:41,903 --> 00:32:44,964
We've got all these tools in the toolbox right now.

676
00:32:44,964 --> 00:32:47,444
And so no more Macs.

677
00:32:47,444 --> 00:32:51,165
We're using Unreal 3 at this point.

678
00:32:51,165 --> 00:32:52,765
And so we made another movie.

679
00:32:52,765 --> 00:32:58,466
Move out and keep your eyes open.

680
00:32:58,466 --> 00:32:58,646
I got it.

681
00:33:34,090 --> 00:33:38,183
Thanks for watching!

682
00:34:54,517 --> 00:34:56,099
animators decided to have a little fun at the end there.

683
00:34:56,099 --> 00:34:59,924
But so, one of the really interesting things about that,

684
00:34:59,924 --> 00:35:02,327
we, you know, we, at this point, we're really pushing it.

685
00:35:02,327 --> 00:35:04,429
We're really pushing the boundaries.

686
00:35:04,429 --> 00:35:07,653
Rush cams, death cams, pod reveals,

687
00:35:07,653 --> 00:35:09,536
how are those going to be?

688
00:35:09,536 --> 00:35:12,720
And, you know, going into it, you know,

689
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,341
if I was going to get

690
00:35:14,557 --> 00:35:15,957
30% I would have been happy.

691
00:35:15,957 --> 00:35:18,759
I think we ended up getting a little more than that.

692
00:35:18,759 --> 00:35:20,340
And the reaction from the programming staff was great.

693
00:35:20,340 --> 00:35:21,201
And they saw it, they were like,

694
00:35:21,201 --> 00:35:23,542
yeah, we can do a lot of this.

695
00:35:23,542 --> 00:35:26,424
But a lot of that stuff did permeate into the game.

696
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:27,564
And it was really useful.

697
00:35:27,564 --> 00:35:29,646
And I think brought back a little bit of immersion

698
00:35:29,646 --> 00:35:31,727
that we were trying to find.

699
00:35:31,727 --> 00:35:36,109
Again, you see pod reveals, how they look,

700
00:35:36,109 --> 00:35:39,051
what the game looks like when you're shooting,

701
00:35:39,051 --> 00:35:40,212
the targeting cameras.

702
00:35:40,212 --> 00:35:43,954
Again, more of the pod reveals and more of the gameplay.

703
00:35:46,393 --> 00:35:47,394
So then that leads us to XCOM 2.

704
00:35:47,394 --> 00:35:50,516
And this was a really different start for us.

705
00:35:50,516 --> 00:35:55,198
A lot of different things happening in this game.

706
00:35:55,198 --> 00:35:58,119
We turned the premise on its head.

707
00:35:58,119 --> 00:35:59,760
It was no longer a defensive game.

708
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,661
Now it was an attacking game.

709
00:36:01,661 --> 00:36:03,342
And that was a pretty big deal.

710
00:36:03,342 --> 00:36:04,523
And you were now a resistance.

711
00:36:04,523 --> 00:36:05,303
And it was 20 years in the future.

712
00:36:05,303 --> 00:36:08,925
Oh, and by the way, you lost the last game,

713
00:36:08,925 --> 00:36:10,426
which was a bit of a twist.

714
00:36:12,260 --> 00:36:13,861
The difference in a sequel,

715
00:36:13,861 --> 00:36:15,542
the theme and tone had changed completely.

716
00:36:15,542 --> 00:36:18,184
The desire to push the visual mechanics

717
00:36:18,184 --> 00:36:19,665
proved out in the first game.

718
00:36:19,665 --> 00:36:21,166
We really wanted to push those.

719
00:36:21,166 --> 00:36:24,068
The engine needed to be converted.

720
00:36:24,068 --> 00:36:25,909
We went to real-time lighting,

721
00:36:25,909 --> 00:36:29,672
went to physically-based rendering.

722
00:36:29,672 --> 00:36:30,793
And the design changes were huge.

723
00:36:30,793 --> 00:36:32,174
And again, when I try to make a previs,

724
00:36:32,174 --> 00:36:35,256
I'm trying to actually encapsulate some of those things

725
00:36:35,256 --> 00:36:38,058
that are the most difficult.

726
00:36:38,058 --> 00:36:38,979
Fully procedural maps.

727
00:36:39,846 --> 00:36:42,208
and new gameplay mechanics.

728
00:36:42,208 --> 00:36:46,131
One of the things here too that's probably worth mentioning

729
00:36:46,131 --> 00:36:48,933
is like the procedural maps part of it.

730
00:36:48,933 --> 00:36:50,814
I was working on that while the team was working

731
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:52,575
on Enemy Within.

732
00:36:52,575 --> 00:36:54,076
And in retrospect, I was probably, I got so wrapped

733
00:36:54,076 --> 00:36:57,099
up in that, that I lost a little bit of my footing

734
00:36:57,099 --> 00:37:01,322
on preparing for the team.

735
00:37:01,322 --> 00:37:05,845
So, one of the things I'll probably do a little different.

736
00:37:05,845 --> 00:37:06,205
But what we knew.

737
00:37:09,219 --> 00:37:11,300
The team was largely intact again.

738
00:37:11,300 --> 00:37:14,321
Our team has been together for 10, 12 years at this point,

739
00:37:14,321 --> 00:37:17,362
for the most part.

740
00:37:17,362 --> 00:37:18,502
We understood the game we were making.

741
00:37:18,502 --> 00:37:22,743
We didn't have to go, well, what is the contemporary equivalent?

742
00:37:22,743 --> 00:37:25,224
The visual mechanics, you needed a pod reveal.

743
00:37:25,224 --> 00:37:29,225
You needed whatever you needed.

744
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:31,586
You knew how the game was going to work, right?

745
00:37:33,337 --> 00:37:35,719
And you understood the presentation.

746
00:37:35,719 --> 00:37:39,544
If you had a new armor type, you knew you had a reveal for it.

747
00:37:39,544 --> 00:37:45,531
All the communication pipelines remained the same.

748
00:37:45,531 --> 00:37:48,314
And we really understood, now having made the first game,

749
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:50,396
we dissected it and what we really

750
00:37:50,396 --> 00:37:53,220
needed to do to make a procedural version of it.

751
00:37:55,085 --> 00:37:57,908
So the approach again, we went to simulated gameplay,

752
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:03,434
an agile attempt again, this time we're in engine.

753
00:38:03,434 --> 00:38:06,997
But unlike before, we're now in the midst

754
00:38:06,997 --> 00:38:09,040
of rebuilding the renderer and the material system.

755
00:38:09,895 --> 00:38:11,736
That was interesting.

756
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:14,116
We also didn't isolate the team.

757
00:38:14,116 --> 00:38:14,897
We didn't feel the need to.

758
00:38:14,897 --> 00:38:17,757
We also didn't have everybody working on it altogether.

759
00:38:17,757 --> 00:38:18,818
It kind of went through chunks.

760
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:20,358
So, it went through phases in it.

761
00:38:20,358 --> 00:38:24,479
While we were developing the game and providing content

762
00:38:24,479 --> 00:38:27,780
for the rest of the team, we were busy making the previs

763
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:33,182
in conjunction with that, which was quite a bit different

764
00:38:33,182 --> 00:38:34,022
and a bit harder.

765
00:38:34,022 --> 00:38:39,343
And then all the assets that we made were game usable.

766
00:38:41,366 --> 00:38:43,266
So, the visual goals.

767
00:38:43,266 --> 00:38:45,647
We really wanted to improve the fidelity of the geometry,

768
00:38:45,647 --> 00:38:48,968
the animation, everything. We wanted to turn everything up.

769
00:38:48,968 --> 00:38:51,468
There were points in Enemy Within

770
00:38:51,468 --> 00:38:56,149
that I wanted to make richer, and so we attacked those.

771
00:38:56,149 --> 00:38:58,290
We wanted to improve the cameras, Overwatch,

772
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:01,731
death cams, just the camera in general, the alien turn.

773
00:39:01,731 --> 00:39:05,572
And then we also added new mechanics like melee.

774
00:39:05,572 --> 00:39:07,532
Concealment mechanic was new.

775
00:39:07,532 --> 00:39:09,052
How are we going to represent a mode

776
00:39:09,052 --> 00:39:10,633
where you were kind of invisible?

777
00:39:11,799 --> 00:39:15,699
to the enemy, calling reinforcements with something new,

778
00:39:15,699 --> 00:39:17,020
making the environment reactive,

779
00:39:17,020 --> 00:39:20,301
like have it speak to you, have it react to your presence,

780
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:23,941
again, your resistance force, and it's a futuristic world,

781
00:39:23,941 --> 00:39:27,022
and then skirting around things with waypoints.

782
00:39:27,022 --> 00:39:29,163
And then we went to establish look and feel,

783
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:30,743
and we needed to use the game engine

784
00:39:30,743 --> 00:39:31,883
as the renderer this time.

785
00:39:31,883 --> 00:39:35,064
So this is the first time I think we've ever shown this.

786
00:39:35,064 --> 00:39:37,625
This is the previous movie from XCOM 2.

787
00:39:44,834 --> 00:39:49,496
Please report any sightings of these civilians to your nearest ambulance station.

788
00:39:49,496 --> 00:39:54,499
Security scan in progress. Your cooperation is appreciated.

789
00:39:54,499 --> 00:39:57,861
Turn around.

790
00:39:57,861 --> 00:40:01,963
Affirmative.

791
00:40:12,241 --> 00:40:33,077
To your nearest airport station. Greetings, please report any sightings.

792
00:40:59,809 --> 00:41:01,850
They're down.

793
00:41:01,850 --> 00:41:07,675
They're repositioning on us.

794
00:41:07,675 --> 00:41:10,477
They got me locked down.

795
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:12,779
I'm alright.

796
00:41:12,779 --> 00:41:16,862
Here goes nothing.

797
00:41:39,867 --> 00:41:40,847
Moving.

798
00:41:40,847 --> 00:41:43,668
Take him out!

799
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:49,110
Hostile neutralized.

800
00:41:49,110 --> 00:41:52,171
I'm taking fire.

801
00:41:52,171 --> 00:42:00,753
Movement ahead.

802
00:42:09,968 --> 00:42:13,570
Hello, I've been advised.

803
00:42:13,570 --> 00:42:21,253
They're bringing in reinforcements!

804
00:42:21,253 --> 00:42:26,334
We've got something new down here.

805
00:42:26,334 --> 00:42:28,495
Oh, I can't think!

806
00:42:28,495 --> 00:42:32,197
Time to finish this.

807
00:42:32,197 --> 00:42:35,338
Roger. He's going down.

808
00:42:41,471 --> 00:42:43,972
Fear the Reaper.

809
00:42:43,972 --> 00:42:46,274
Roger, tracking.

810
00:42:46,274 --> 00:42:53,158
I've got eyes on the target.

811
00:42:53,158 --> 00:42:54,758
Got it.

812
00:42:54,758 --> 00:42:56,559
He's down.

813
00:43:14,485 --> 00:43:18,249
No surrender.

814
00:43:18,249 --> 00:43:19,531
Roger.

815
00:43:48,602 --> 00:43:53,463
So a lot of the stuff in there ended up making its way into the game.

816
00:43:53,463 --> 00:44:00,686
Melee, those beginnings of our concealment system, reinforcements, all sorts of stuff, which was great.

817
00:44:00,686 --> 00:44:02,386
We definitely were able to establish the tone of the game.

818
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:07,366
we clearly improved the fidelity of the game.

819
00:44:07,366 --> 00:44:09,527
We actually were able to take a look at our animation pipeline

820
00:44:09,527 --> 00:44:11,708
and streamline the number of animations we needed.

821
00:44:11,708 --> 00:44:15,890
We were doing all that while we were building this.

822
00:44:15,890 --> 00:44:17,431
You know, it also gave us a real chance

823
00:44:17,431 --> 00:44:19,772
to actually work with engineering on the lighting.

824
00:44:19,772 --> 00:44:22,134
The lighting is clearly incomplete in this version,

825
00:44:22,134 --> 00:44:24,415
and it is something that we were able to work with them

826
00:44:24,415 --> 00:44:25,435
while we were doing it.

827
00:44:26,917 --> 00:44:28,497
We improved some of the game cameras.

828
00:44:28,497 --> 00:44:30,579
Again, we got our start on a building kit

829
00:44:30,579 --> 00:44:33,440
that would allow us to make procedural worlds.

830
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,203
And character customization was definitely a thought

831
00:44:38,203 --> 00:44:41,525
at this point that was really expanding.

832
00:44:41,525 --> 00:44:47,668
So this is, on the left, that's the game, the previs movie.

833
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:50,830
And on the right is what the game ended up looking like.

834
00:44:52,218 --> 00:44:55,741
And again, this is the Overwatch cameras.

835
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,402
This story to this is very interesting.

836
00:44:58,402 --> 00:45:03,125
We had the Overwatch in the game, right?

837
00:45:03,125 --> 00:45:05,926
And it was something that the lead engineer

838
00:45:05,926 --> 00:45:07,367
and I had talked a bit about,

839
00:45:07,367 --> 00:45:09,368
and we had talked a bit about as a team,

840
00:45:09,368 --> 00:45:13,151
making that a lot more immersive and feeling

841
00:45:14,827 --> 00:45:15,988
more tense.

842
00:45:15,988 --> 00:45:19,213
And so he had been working on some stuff,

843
00:45:19,213 --> 00:45:22,017
and then at E3 we put in a double overwatch, right,

844
00:45:22,017 --> 00:45:24,460
where you would seamlessly move from shooting from one

845
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:25,362
to the next.

846
00:45:25,362 --> 00:45:26,844
If you had two characters in overwatch,

847
00:45:26,844 --> 00:45:28,386
the first one would fire, and then it would.

848
00:45:28,966 --> 00:45:31,687
the camera would seamlessly interpolate over to the next.

849
00:45:31,687 --> 00:45:34,628
And so we talked a little bit about it,

850
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:37,029
we threw it in an E3 as this,

851
00:45:37,029 --> 00:45:38,970
we're gonna, this is how we want this to look like,

852
00:45:38,970 --> 00:45:40,431
we think we've got this gonna work.

853
00:45:40,431 --> 00:45:41,311
And he walks in and he's like,

854
00:45:41,311 --> 00:45:44,213
oh yeah, by the way, that thing you wanted to do,

855
00:45:44,213 --> 00:45:46,314
yeah, like, it's on my machine if you wanna see it.

856
00:45:46,314 --> 00:45:48,995
And it was better than anything we had fabricated,

857
00:45:48,995 --> 00:45:52,376
which was pretty amazing.

858
00:45:52,376 --> 00:45:55,678
So, in closing, I think that, you know,

859
00:45:55,678 --> 00:45:57,478
as you're approaching pre-production.

860
00:45:58,658 --> 00:46:00,479
You have to think about your team.

861
00:46:00,479 --> 00:46:01,900
You have to cater your pre-production to your team.

862
00:46:01,900 --> 00:46:04,161
Identify the right questions.

863
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,082
What are the things that are going

864
00:46:06,082 --> 00:46:09,563
to impact you that are going to give you answers, real answers,

865
00:46:09,563 --> 00:46:12,664
that you can use down the road?

866
00:46:12,664 --> 00:46:14,525
Because if you avoid them, you're

867
00:46:14,525 --> 00:46:16,646
going to get them at some point anyway.

868
00:46:16,646 --> 00:46:20,688
So you may as well try to front load them as much as possible.

869
00:46:20,688 --> 00:46:22,489
Work large to small.

870
00:46:22,489 --> 00:46:25,470
Questions without answers, like the floor transition,

871
00:46:25,470 --> 00:46:27,751
they were still really important questions.

872
00:46:29,497 --> 00:46:30,938
Presentation is the key.

873
00:46:30,938 --> 00:46:33,861
I think I've kind of talked a lot about that.

874
00:46:33,861 --> 00:46:35,942
And pushing the boundaries, you know, challenge, convention.

875
00:46:35,942 --> 00:46:37,383
Like, can we do this?

876
00:46:37,383 --> 00:46:40,045
Making that first movie, like,

877
00:46:40,045 --> 00:46:41,526
it challenged everything in our studio.

878
00:46:41,526 --> 00:46:44,048
Like, where was, what was our engine going to be?

879
00:46:44,048 --> 00:46:46,410
You know, that opened up us actually moving to Unreal.

880
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:49,632
Because we put forth, this is what we want it to look like.

881
00:46:49,632 --> 00:46:51,353
Now, how do we get there?

882
00:46:52,642 --> 00:46:54,523
And again, tailor your pre-production for your game

883
00:46:54,523 --> 00:46:55,244
and your team.

884
00:46:55,244 --> 00:46:58,447
Really think about how all those things come together

885
00:46:58,447 --> 00:47:02,510
to provide the pre-production you want to enter production.

886
00:47:02,510 --> 00:47:06,073
And that's it.

887
00:47:06,073 --> 00:47:07,975
So, anybody have any questions?

888
00:47:07,975 --> 00:47:08,395
If you do ...

889
00:47:08,395 --> 00:47:08,815
Thank you.

890
00:47:16,477 --> 00:47:17,638
I hope that was helpful.

891
00:47:17,638 --> 00:47:19,520
I've got like 10 years of this all collapsed down

892
00:47:19,520 --> 00:47:19,960
into 45 minutes.

893
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:24,385
If any of your questions, if you guys want to go to the mic,

894
00:47:24,385 --> 00:47:26,027
we have a few minutes.

895
00:47:26,027 --> 00:47:29,671
I also have presents to get you guys to come out of hiding.

896
00:47:29,671 --> 00:47:33,716
If you don't have XCOM, the first people asking questions

897
00:47:33,716 --> 00:47:36,539
can come pick a game.

898
00:47:36,539 --> 00:47:37,380
So go ahead.

899
00:47:37,380 --> 00:47:37,780
Hey, Greg.

900
00:47:38,055 --> 00:47:41,837
Thanks so much for the awesome presentation. My question was actually about your interaction

901
00:47:41,837 --> 00:47:46,598
with design because settling in a lot of art stuff requires a lot of design stuff to be

902
00:47:46,598 --> 00:47:51,480
figured out. Did design go through a separate kind of pre-process that they did or did you

903
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,841
guys kind of do it organically and how does that sort of chicken and egg thing work for you?

904
00:47:55,085 --> 00:47:59,647
So especially with Enemy Unknown, that was organic.

905
00:47:59,647 --> 00:48:01,987
Again, it was us and the lead designer, right?

906
00:48:01,987 --> 00:48:04,608
So we would talk to him.

907
00:48:04,608 --> 00:48:06,528
I talked to him for eight months leading up to us

908
00:48:06,528 --> 00:48:08,269
actually getting the team.

909
00:48:08,269 --> 00:48:09,769
And as we were collecting stuff, it was this,

910
00:48:09,769 --> 00:48:11,710
we'd spend a half hour a day just like,

911
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:13,970
well, what do we think we're gonna do here?

912
00:48:13,970 --> 00:48:14,811
What about this situation?

913
00:48:14,811 --> 00:48:15,651
What about that?

914
00:48:15,811 --> 00:48:17,212
Do we want a sectoid?

915
00:48:17,212 --> 00:48:18,473
If we do, how big is it?

916
00:48:18,473 --> 00:48:19,874
Even those kind of questions.

917
00:48:19,874 --> 00:48:22,916
And so as we got into the previs,

918
00:48:22,916 --> 00:48:24,757
he would come down and would be like,

919
00:48:24,757 --> 00:48:28,460
literally, can, mock it up, can we play from here?

920
00:48:28,460 --> 00:48:30,121
You think we can play from here?

921
00:48:30,121 --> 00:48:30,641
Yes or no?

922
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,342
Oh, it's too close, let's back the camera out.

923
00:48:32,342 --> 00:48:33,723
Let's tilt it down.

924
00:48:33,723 --> 00:48:37,526
And it was a much more organic situation.

925
00:48:37,526 --> 00:48:38,607
And it worked great.

926
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:41,509
I mean, it was one of the best

927
00:48:41,509 --> 00:48:42,970
working situations I've ever had.

928
00:48:43,197 --> 00:48:48,263
That sounds awesome, but did you guys ever end up in a situation after the pre-production

929
00:48:48,263 --> 00:48:52,027
where design had to change stuff and you had to reconsider?

930
00:48:52,027 --> 00:48:55,812
That's where we went and made that Combat 2 movie, right?

931
00:48:55,812 --> 00:48:59,976
So yeah, they were in a situation where they wanted to re-look at things and then we...

932
00:49:00,530 --> 00:49:03,552
Our answer is usually to preview something.

933
00:49:03,552 --> 00:49:07,254
And so we jumped in and worked again with him

934
00:49:07,254 --> 00:49:08,314
to kind of like, can we do this?

935
00:49:08,314 --> 00:49:09,195
Can we not do that?

936
00:49:09,195 --> 00:49:11,176
It's really, one of the things I've found is

937
00:49:11,176 --> 00:49:14,318
I think this is great working with the designers

938
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:15,959
because we're able to visualize what they think

939
00:49:15,959 --> 00:49:18,300
is gonna be happening before it happens.

940
00:49:18,920 --> 00:49:21,542
And so if it doesn't work when we try to visualize it,

941
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:24,083
I think we can head off their questions too,

942
00:49:24,083 --> 00:49:26,444
which is why I try to always work in,

943
00:49:26,444 --> 00:49:30,466
you know, what are some of the more difficult melee

944
00:49:30,466 --> 00:49:31,847
and you want a concealment mode,

945
00:49:31,847 --> 00:49:34,068
you want reinforcements to come in,

946
00:49:34,068 --> 00:49:34,928
how do we approach that?

947
00:49:34,928 --> 00:49:36,469
So that was, yeah, that's kind of how it worked.

948
00:49:36,469 --> 00:49:38,070
But yeah, we do that frequently.

949
00:49:38,070 --> 00:49:38,550
Cool, thank you.

950
00:49:38,550 --> 00:49:38,750
Yeah.

951
00:49:38,750 --> 00:49:39,211
Oh, good.

952
00:49:42,378 --> 00:49:43,878
How's it going?

953
00:49:43,878 --> 00:49:46,239
So you had mentioned that at the beginning

954
00:49:46,239 --> 00:49:48,319
of the pre-production you gave everybody like a new computer

955
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:50,360
to get that kind of fresh start, that fresh feel.

956
00:49:50,360 --> 00:49:52,180
So when you start to approach a sequel,

957
00:49:52,180 --> 00:49:55,341
I think you tend to basically take the code base

958
00:49:55,341 --> 00:49:57,261
from the first game and move it over,

959
00:49:57,261 --> 00:50:00,682
which of course brings along all of the frustrations

960
00:50:00,682 --> 00:50:03,683
from the code base from the original game over to the sequel.

961
00:50:03,683 --> 00:50:06,043
How do you approach that situation

962
00:50:06,043 --> 00:50:08,884
and kind of still getting that kind of fresh start

963
00:50:08,884 --> 00:50:11,245
without bringing over the scars of the earlier development?

964
00:50:11,538 --> 00:50:13,624
Uh, so I think I did that wrong one too.

965
00:50:14,922 --> 00:50:20,285
You know, I didn't wipe, we didn't wipe the asset library,

966
00:50:20,285 --> 00:50:22,266
even though we were switching renders,

967
00:50:22,266 --> 00:50:25,667
because we wanted the LDs to have assets to work with.

968
00:50:25,667 --> 00:50:29,489
And that was a bit messy and caused a lot of problems for us.

969
00:50:29,489 --> 00:50:33,971
I think that clean start is something

970
00:50:33,971 --> 00:50:35,632
that I underestimated into,

971
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:37,212
that I think I did really well on in one.

972
00:50:37,212 --> 00:50:39,653
And then I, you know, I got to two, and I was knee-deep

973
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:41,334
in procedural, and I wasn't.

974
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:45,595
I think I could have been better about that.

975
00:50:45,595 --> 00:50:47,337
Like, you know, how do you separate that,

976
00:50:47,337 --> 00:50:50,199
clean out all the old stuff, get a fresh start?

977
00:50:50,199 --> 00:50:55,705
Is it a, you know, making sure everybody has something

978
00:50:55,705 --> 00:50:58,367
to work with day one, you know, that's huge.

979
00:50:58,367 --> 00:51:02,311
If you can keep guys from deflating,

980
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:03,873
it is so much more work.

981
00:51:04,585 --> 00:51:08,907
to pull guys up after they've kind of deflated than it is.

982
00:51:08,907 --> 00:51:12,109
If you can kind of just catch them before they get that far

983
00:51:12,109 --> 00:51:13,989
and give them something to be excited about.

984
00:51:13,989 --> 00:51:17,851
I mean, it's your job as an AD to kind of be a cheerleader

985
00:51:17,851 --> 00:51:19,532
to a degree, right?

986
00:51:19,532 --> 00:51:22,053
So yeah, that was kind of how it worked.

987
00:51:22,053 --> 00:51:22,433
Thank you.

988
00:51:22,433 --> 00:51:22,733
Can I grab it?

989
00:51:22,733 --> 00:51:25,755
Yeah, yeah, whatever you don't have, you guys.

990
00:51:25,755 --> 00:51:26,035
Go ahead.

991
00:51:26,210 --> 00:51:31,853
How critical do you think it is to have an art director at the very beginnings of pre-production?

992
00:51:31,853 --> 00:51:37,256
It was really interesting to see your approach because you had no programmers.

993
00:51:37,256 --> 00:51:40,638
The studio that I'm coming from, we typically are very design-oriented,

994
00:51:40,638 --> 00:51:43,379
so we try out a lot of experimentation with game design,

995
00:51:43,379 --> 00:51:45,941
and we actually don't have a whole lot of artists early on.

996
00:51:46,278 --> 00:51:49,821
And so it's interesting to see how studios do it different ways,

997
00:51:49,821 --> 00:51:52,784
but if you are starting pre-production without an art director,

998
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:55,266
is that an okay option in your opinion?

999
00:51:55,266 --> 00:51:58,089
And do you have any experience with that?

1000
00:51:58,089 --> 00:52:03,614
Okay, so is it okay to start pre-production without an art director?

1001
00:52:03,614 --> 00:52:06,477
I guess it depends on the game and the team,

1002
00:52:06,477 --> 00:52:10,380
how senior the team is and the understanding of the game you're making.

1003
00:52:10,380 --> 00:52:11,321
But I, you know, I...

1004
00:52:12,852 --> 00:52:15,495
I think having an art director is a really good idea.

1005
00:52:15,495 --> 00:52:18,999
You know, we're, we come, we come from a,

1006
00:52:18,999 --> 00:52:22,183
yeah, I come from a design-driven studio as well, right?

1007
00:52:22,183 --> 00:52:23,505
Like, and for us, this was a departure.

1008
00:52:23,505 --> 00:52:25,887
This was the first time that any of us

1009
00:52:25,887 --> 00:52:27,109
had worked this way in the studio.

1010
00:52:27,109 --> 00:52:29,572
But I think it's super important

1011
00:52:29,572 --> 00:52:30,533
to have an art director early.

1012
00:52:30,533 --> 00:52:32,936
I mean, there's, it's finding those questions.

1013
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:37,609
and deciding what those questions are

1014
00:52:37,609 --> 00:52:39,730
and having the vision to kind of think about

1015
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:42,871
what is going to cost us money later.

1016
00:52:42,871 --> 00:52:44,572
It's easy to underestimate that,

1017
00:52:44,572 --> 00:52:47,673
but I think it's absolutely crucial.

1018
00:52:47,673 --> 00:52:50,574
And again, I think it's having the right art director

1019
00:52:50,574 --> 00:52:51,434
as well, you know?

1020
00:52:51,434 --> 00:52:53,775
Does that role sometimes present itself

1021
00:52:53,775 --> 00:52:56,796
or is that very clearly defined on day one typically?

1022
00:52:57,537 --> 00:52:58,597
from your experience?

1023
00:52:58,597 --> 00:52:59,278
What do you mean?

1024
00:52:59,278 --> 00:53:02,059
Like, day one when you start pre-production, do you say,

1025
00:53:02,059 --> 00:53:04,900
oh, okay, this person is the art director for this project?

1026
00:53:04,900 --> 00:53:07,341
Or is it typically you have several senior level people

1027
00:53:07,341 --> 00:53:10,062
and one of them tends to move into that role?

1028
00:53:10,062 --> 00:53:11,463
Do we have an art director when we start?

1029
00:53:11,463 --> 00:53:11,743
Yeah.

1030
00:53:11,743 --> 00:53:14,725
Like we know, like I knew for eight months

1031
00:53:14,725 --> 00:53:16,165
I was going to be the art director on XCOM.

1032
00:53:16,165 --> 00:53:16,265
Cool.

1033
00:53:16,555 --> 00:53:18,636
We try to have that worked out, because again,

1034
00:53:18,636 --> 00:53:21,057
you've got to get your communication amongst

1035
00:53:21,057 --> 00:53:22,437
your management team worked out,

1036
00:53:22,437 --> 00:53:24,338
and then figuring out the leads.

1037
00:53:24,338 --> 00:53:26,938
I think you can delay leads for a little while.

1038
00:53:26,938 --> 00:53:29,439
There's points where I'm not necessarily in a rush.

1039
00:53:29,439 --> 00:53:31,640
If our team structure is really flat,

1040
00:53:31,640 --> 00:53:34,621
and again, as long as we all work together,

1041
00:53:34,621 --> 00:53:36,681
it's pretty level.

1042
00:53:36,681 --> 00:53:37,982
We can delay that sometimes.

1043
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:39,422
I don't necessarily rush into that,

1044
00:53:39,422 --> 00:53:43,483
but you can delay that sometimes.

1045
00:53:43,483 --> 00:53:45,004
I think it's really important to have key people in

1046
00:53:45,004 --> 00:53:46,384
the right roles, and that includes our cracker.

1047
00:53:46,647 --> 00:53:47,107
Cool, thanks.

1048
00:53:47,107 --> 00:53:50,129
Hey, thanks for the talk.

1049
00:53:50,129 --> 00:53:53,831
If you had 20% of the pre-pro budget that you have,

1050
00:53:53,831 --> 00:53:55,072
what would you cut?

1051
00:53:55,072 --> 00:53:56,453
What would you prioritize?

1052
00:53:56,453 --> 00:54:00,775
Well, if I had 20% of the pre-pro budget that I have,

1053
00:54:00,775 --> 00:54:02,216
what would I cut?

1054
00:54:02,216 --> 00:54:05,959
That's a, man, that is a tough question.

1055
00:54:05,959 --> 00:54:08,580
It's like my producer's in the room or something.

1056
00:54:08,580 --> 00:54:10,862
Did he feed you that question?

1057
00:54:10,862 --> 00:54:14,124
He's in the back right there.

1058
00:54:14,124 --> 00:54:14,204
No.

1059
00:54:14,968 --> 00:54:18,450
Well, I guess I would cut the stuff that is more isolated.

1060
00:54:18,450 --> 00:54:22,053
Like, again, I'm always going to focus on what is the presentation, what's the gameplay

1061
00:54:22,053 --> 00:54:24,494
change, like what are the things we need to solve.

1062
00:54:24,494 --> 00:54:28,697
So like, again, we kind of know character customization, I could cut that.

1063
00:54:28,697 --> 00:54:32,760
I could, you know, do we have to tell the little player vignette that kind of works

1064
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:36,342
its way through these things I make, that we make?

1065
00:54:36,342 --> 00:54:37,443
Maybe, you know, I mean, I...

1066
00:54:38,104 --> 00:54:40,907
I'm kind of looking at it now, we're just doing chunks, right?

1067
00:54:40,907 --> 00:54:43,870
Like, do I have to do the connective thing?

1068
00:54:43,870 --> 00:54:50,377
Maybe you could actually break it up into little mini-previs?

1069
00:54:50,377 --> 00:54:51,258
And that would probably work.

1070
00:54:51,258 --> 00:54:53,480
And that would probably cut your budget a bit.

1071
00:54:53,480 --> 00:54:55,522
What was your turnaround time on a mini-previs?

1072
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:59,815
On those pre-visits, we do about four months total.

1073
00:54:59,815 --> 00:55:04,036
Start each one, even the one where we're building the game with it.

1074
00:55:04,036 --> 00:55:06,797
It takes about four months from start to finish

1075
00:55:06,797 --> 00:55:08,117
with about 10 or 12 of us on the team.

1076
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:09,838
We start with a 2D animatic generally in most cases,

1077
00:55:09,838 --> 00:55:10,958
and then we run from there.

1078
00:55:10,958 --> 00:55:13,039
And we stick to it pretty well.

1079
00:55:13,039 --> 00:55:17,180
I mean, like that storyboard that was drawn on that whiteboard,

1080
00:55:17,180 --> 00:55:18,400
that terrible chicken scratch.

1081
00:55:19,169 --> 00:55:20,630
That's the only art, by the way,

1082
00:55:20,630 --> 00:55:23,513
in the presentation that was mine.

1083
00:55:23,513 --> 00:55:25,515
My team is very talented.

1084
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:29,058
But that was one of those things where, yeah,

1085
00:55:29,058 --> 00:55:31,480
we started the 2D storyboard and we run from there

1086
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:33,041
and it sticks pretty close generally.

1087
00:55:33,041 --> 00:55:36,124
And our timing is really close to our 2D storyboards too,

1088
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,706
even with Maki and UI.

1089
00:55:38,706 --> 00:55:38,946
So, yep.

1090
00:55:38,946 --> 00:55:39,827
Thanks.

1091
00:55:39,827 --> 00:55:41,749
Yeah, come get a game if you want.

1092
00:55:41,749 --> 00:55:42,329
Go ahead.

1093
00:55:42,558 --> 00:55:49,588
Hi. So when you're fleshing out pre-production, you have this general idea of the design of

1094
00:55:49,588 --> 00:55:55,897
the game. How do you lock that down, maybe help prevent feature creep? And I know there's

1095
00:55:55,897 --> 00:55:59,002
a lot of cool ideas that you come up with during the development process.

1096
00:55:59,502 --> 00:56:03,966
If you're trying to build a presentation for either the producers or an event like E3

1097
00:56:03,966 --> 00:56:10,251
and you have a cool idea, what kind of personal criteria do you have to say,

1098
00:56:10,251 --> 00:56:14,874
okay, we will let this in, we will work on this so we can get it in for E3 because it's really cool

1099
00:56:14,874 --> 00:56:21,980
or no, we shouldn't try and overwork ourselves and work backwards by trying to implement this?

1100
00:56:21,980 --> 00:56:25,182
So, how do I decide what to work into a presentation?

1101
00:56:25,342 --> 00:56:31,719
that? Not so much that but just preventing feature creep in a large scale sense.

1102
00:56:31,991 --> 00:56:36,795
Yeah, so when I start these, again, it's a dialogue with the designer and what do we want to do,

1103
00:56:36,795 --> 00:56:44,761
what are his goals, and then I try to work each one of those into the previs that I'm working on.

1104
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:48,905
And once we kind of set that, it's pretty well set.

1105
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:56,331
Now, as we're in discovery, and the whole point of it being this agile process that we kind of pick our platform on,

1106
00:56:58,782 --> 00:57:01,903
If it, as he sees things, we may give things,

1107
00:57:01,903 --> 00:57:04,664
challenge things that make him rethink it,

1108
00:57:04,664 --> 00:57:06,104
and vice versa, as he sees things,

1109
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:08,905
it might become more clear.

1110
00:57:08,905 --> 00:57:11,546
And so, you know, but that's usually established

1111
00:57:11,546 --> 00:57:13,167
pretty early that the big ticket things

1112
00:57:13,167 --> 00:57:14,447
we're gonna try to hit.

1113
00:57:14,447 --> 00:57:16,027
And at that point, it's a numbers game.

1114
00:57:16,027 --> 00:57:19,108
Like we wanna, we don't wanna like overextend

1115
00:57:19,108 --> 00:57:22,249
too far into our pre-production budget.

1116
00:57:22,249 --> 00:57:23,990
So again, we try to contain these things

1117
00:57:23,990 --> 00:57:25,090
in a certain amount of time.

1118
00:57:25,782 --> 00:57:31,411
So yeah, we try to establish those questions early with the designer.

1119
00:57:31,411 --> 00:57:33,313
And it usually doesn't creep much.

1120
00:57:33,313 --> 00:57:36,398
If anything, it streamlines it for him and us.

1121
00:57:36,398 --> 00:57:39,543
We can kind of figure out, catch the pitfalls early.

1122
00:57:40,226 --> 00:57:41,947
So if you end up seeing something that's like,

1123
00:57:41,947 --> 00:57:43,667
oh, this would be a cool direction,

1124
00:57:43,667 --> 00:57:45,468
but you're like, it's getting away

1125
00:57:45,468 --> 00:57:47,269
from our core design concept,

1126
00:57:47,269 --> 00:57:49,830
you go, it'd be cool, but we're not gonna do it

1127
00:57:49,830 --> 00:57:52,231
because we're getting a little too far out.

1128
00:57:52,231 --> 00:57:53,952
We'll generally rethink it.

1129
00:57:53,952 --> 00:57:55,312
But it's a collaboration.

1130
00:57:55,312 --> 00:57:58,854
It's a conversation between us and design and tech, really.

1131
00:57:58,854 --> 00:57:59,874
And as long as we work together,

1132
00:57:59,874 --> 00:58:02,615
it's a pretty open conversation.

1133
00:58:02,615 --> 00:58:03,235
Thank you.

1134
00:58:04,105 --> 00:58:08,429
This is a question for you more or less than pre-production.

1135
00:58:08,429 --> 00:58:12,813
So be free to say if you'd like me to talk to you afterwards.

1136
00:58:12,813 --> 00:58:16,296
But I'm going into the college aspect

1137
00:58:16,296 --> 00:58:18,358
of learning all this stuff.

1138
00:58:18,358 --> 00:58:23,863
But my true passion relies in team and project management.

1139
00:58:23,863 --> 00:58:27,426
How can anyone like me get to a position like you are in today?

1140
00:58:29,737 --> 00:58:35,909
Learn a lot about the different systems like understand each discipline like I'm not an expert in anyone

1141
00:58:35,909 --> 00:58:39,056
My background is really in environments and systems

1142
00:58:39,056 --> 00:58:40,298
I'm an illustrator

1143
00:58:41,988 --> 00:58:42,348
and a painter.

1144
00:58:42,348 --> 00:58:45,429
And so for me, I would consider myself

1145
00:58:45,429 --> 00:58:47,709
actually more of an environment artist,

1146
00:58:47,709 --> 00:58:49,970
but I've done all of it.

1147
00:58:49,970 --> 00:58:53,651
Enough to be dangerous at all of it, to be honest.

1148
00:58:53,651 --> 00:58:56,051
So get a broad understanding of it.

1149
00:58:56,051 --> 00:58:58,212
Like that's key, that's the first place.

1150
00:58:58,212 --> 00:59:01,073
You can understand what people are talking about

1151
00:59:01,073 --> 00:59:02,653
when they're talking about the needs

1152
00:59:02,653 --> 00:59:04,053
and how to ask the right questions.

1153
00:59:04,053 --> 00:59:08,354
And then, like was said in the previous talk,

1154
00:59:08,354 --> 00:59:09,495
get the right...

1155
00:59:10,379 --> 00:59:13,121
leads, like get strong leads in the people that you're in,

1156
00:59:13,121 --> 00:59:16,024
the places where you're weak.

1157
00:59:16,024 --> 00:59:17,885
You know, I like animation a lot,

1158
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:20,588
but my animation lead is fantastic.

1159
00:59:20,588 --> 00:59:24,411
And you know, we have a partnership where he works on stuff

1160
00:59:24,411 --> 00:59:27,494
and I only hit him when something's wrong.

1161
00:59:27,494 --> 00:59:27,694
So.

1162
00:59:27,694 --> 00:59:29,395
Would you approach a job of,

1163
00:59:29,395 --> 00:59:31,697
oh, I'm a team manager, da da da,

1164
00:59:31,697 --> 00:59:34,400
or would you approach them or start indie

1165
00:59:34,400 --> 00:59:36,061
and then work your way up with a portfolio?

1166
00:59:39,162 --> 00:59:41,304
probably start indie maybe, it depends.

1167
00:59:41,304 --> 00:59:43,246
We can talk afterwards.

1168
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:43,766
Yeah.

1169
00:59:43,766 --> 00:59:44,867
Thank you very much.

1170
00:59:44,867 --> 00:59:47,870
One last question, right?

1171
00:59:47,870 --> 00:59:48,130
Okay.

1172
00:59:48,130 --> 00:59:50,031
I can catch up with me afterwards

1173
00:59:50,031 --> 00:59:52,253
if anybody wants to talk.

1174
00:59:52,253 --> 00:59:57,298
So what was the challenges perceived with going from?

1175
00:59:57,895 --> 01:00:03,558
one engine to another specifically in reference to real time lighting and a PBR pipeline.

1176
01:00:03,558 --> 01:00:08,419
Oh man, it was a nightmare. I mean like it was just so different like and it's funny because

1177
01:00:08,419 --> 01:00:15,242
it's like PBR seems so easy and it makes complete sense but the actual execution of it is a little

1178
01:00:15,242 --> 01:00:20,964
finicky sometimes. And so that was a big big thing. The PBR part was hard and plus we were actually

1179
01:00:20,964 --> 01:00:21,464
developing.

1180
01:00:22,125 --> 01:00:27,974
Like they were engineering it as I'm making, so it was hard to see what was right and what was wrong,

1181
01:00:27,974 --> 01:00:30,558
or what was just being rendered wrong.

1182
01:00:31,518 --> 01:00:34,401
And then the, you know, deferred lighting, you know,

1183
01:00:34,401 --> 01:00:37,043
going from baked lighting to deferred was, you know,

1184
01:00:37,043 --> 01:00:40,647
it was essential for what we were trying to make,

1185
01:00:40,647 --> 01:00:42,289
but there were definitely like, I think,

1186
01:00:42,289 --> 01:00:48,675
things that you lose in that process, for sure.

1187
01:00:48,675 --> 01:00:50,417
But, I mean, I think that there's ways to work

1188
01:00:50,417 --> 01:00:51,178
around all that stuff.

1189
01:00:51,178 --> 01:00:54,241
But, you know, building a rocket ship as you're flying

1190
01:00:54,241 --> 01:00:55,622
to the moon is always hard.

1191
01:00:56,283 --> 01:00:59,747
But it was also good because we were also, I think,

1192
01:00:59,747 --> 01:01:03,711
we're able to identify things as we were moving, you know,

1193
01:01:03,711 --> 01:01:06,795
in a parallel road with the engineers.

1194
01:01:06,795 --> 01:01:07,776
So that was a plus.

1195
01:01:07,776 --> 01:01:08,216
Thank you.

1196
01:01:08,216 --> 01:01:09,057
No problem.

1197
01:01:09,057 --> 01:01:09,698
Thanks, everybody.
