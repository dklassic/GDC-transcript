1
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:07,001
All right, good morning everyone.

2
00:00:07,321 --> 00:00:08,602
Thanks for coming, it's very kind.

3
00:00:09,903 --> 00:00:11,665
Again, a little bit of housekeeping before we begin.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:14,167
Please set your phones and noisy things

5
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,188
to silent airplane mode.

6
00:00:17,329 --> 00:00:19,791
We'd ask that you please complete your post-session surveys

7
00:00:19,871 --> 00:00:21,573
after this session ends.

8
00:00:22,773 --> 00:00:24,875
We've left some time for questions and answers

9
00:00:24,915 --> 00:00:26,256
at the end of this particular session.

10
00:00:26,657 --> 00:00:28,078
Please keep those questions concise

11
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,219
so that we can answer as many as we can.

12
00:00:31,088 --> 00:00:34,791
And lastly, if there's lots of questions or you want to chat to our lovely speakers at the end,

13
00:00:35,732 --> 00:00:41,816
the post-session area where you can chat to all of us is actually just outside this room out there in the corridor.

14
00:00:41,836 --> 00:00:44,058
So we'll be there to have a quick chat if you'd like.

15
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:47,181
Okay, good morning. Hello.

16
00:00:48,041 --> 00:00:54,306
My name is Sebastian Long. I'm Director of Player Research, a games user research agency, a player data...

17
00:00:55,128 --> 00:00:55,709
consultancy.

18
00:00:56,589 --> 00:00:58,370
And it's an honor to gather and introduce

19
00:00:58,390 --> 00:01:02,331
these four fantastic talks on improving retention,

20
00:01:03,511 --> 00:01:08,053
specifically how player data can make better games and game

21
00:01:08,073 --> 00:01:11,434
design choices, leading to players sticking around

22
00:01:11,474 --> 00:01:12,955
in our games for longer.

23
00:01:15,436 --> 00:01:19,417
We all want to make games that players love for a long time.

24
00:01:21,305 --> 00:01:26,269
To do so, to ensure we design a game that holds players' attention for months,

25
00:01:27,190 --> 00:01:32,475
we cannot leave game design to chance, nor to intuition, nor to uncertainty.

26
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:37,099
And the bigger our player bases get, and the longer they play,

27
00:01:37,639 --> 00:01:42,604
the more distant players' real experiences get from our own assumptions or expectations.

28
00:01:45,506 --> 00:01:48,729
Player data has always been used to combat these assumptions.

29
00:01:50,259 --> 00:01:52,700
The more we know of our players' journey through our games,

30
00:01:53,101 --> 00:01:55,682
the more deliberate we can be to achieve good design

31
00:01:55,922 --> 00:01:58,103
and keep them on that desired journey

32
00:01:58,863 --> 00:02:02,265
through user tests, through player interviews,

33
00:02:02,325 --> 00:02:05,067
through surveys and polls, in-game telemetry,

34
00:02:05,487 --> 00:02:08,148
and a whole toolkit of data-gathering research

35
00:02:08,188 --> 00:02:08,568
techniques.

36
00:02:11,590 --> 00:02:13,331
Applying player data to game development

37
00:02:13,671 --> 00:02:15,452
has never been more widespread than today

38
00:02:16,252 --> 00:02:18,434
in this era of live games and evolving games

39
00:02:18,494 --> 00:02:19,414
and connected devices.

40
00:02:22,072 --> 00:02:25,352
where retention is measured more like in months than in minutes.

41
00:02:27,193 --> 00:02:30,994
But getting rich insight from players, our existing player

42
00:02:31,034 --> 00:02:32,034
base, is really tough.

43
00:02:33,154 --> 00:02:36,295
And researching potential retention before public launch

44
00:02:37,115 --> 00:02:37,775
is tougher still.

45
00:02:40,236 --> 00:02:41,716
So in this session of MicroTalks,

46
00:02:42,356 --> 00:02:45,497
we're going to take four case studies in using player data

47
00:02:45,537 --> 00:02:48,638
to explore retention toward building a game that players

48
00:02:48,678 --> 00:02:50,738
love to come back to again and again.

49
00:02:52,129 --> 00:02:54,691
In each talk, you'll be hearing from games user experience

50
00:02:54,711 --> 00:02:55,192
researchers.

51
00:02:56,232 --> 00:02:57,293
So let's talk about that first.

52
00:02:59,655 --> 00:03:02,417
Games user experience researcher is a professional game

53
00:03:02,437 --> 00:03:05,840
development role dedicated to gathering and analyzing

54
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:06,440
player data.

55
00:03:07,681 --> 00:03:11,905
To inform game design choices, games UX researchers design

56
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:16,128
and conduct research studies to generate player data, data

57
00:03:16,148 --> 00:03:20,952
that is actionable, that is rigorous, that is on time, and

58
00:03:20,972 --> 00:03:21,672
that is persuasive.

59
00:03:23,277 --> 00:03:26,338
Design teams, perhaps yourselves, will roll that data

60
00:03:26,418 --> 00:03:28,339
into your decision-making toward better design.

61
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:34,580
It's sometimes player data that inspires new game design ideas

62
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:37,301
to be inspired by our players because we know them better,

63
00:03:37,661 --> 00:03:39,542
their desires, their motivations, their spending.

64
00:03:41,062 --> 00:03:43,583
It's sometimes data that continuously improves

65
00:03:43,823 --> 00:03:46,723
game design towards continuous improvement through iteration

66
00:03:47,204 --> 00:03:49,144
by better understanding our players' interactions

67
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:51,265
with our work-in-progress designs that we have.

68
00:03:53,382 --> 00:03:55,244
Games user experience researchers, like us,

69
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:58,688
typically bring background in psychology, cognitive science,

70
00:03:58,808 --> 00:04:01,671
UX, anthropology, and similar.

71
00:04:04,053 --> 00:04:06,355
These backgrounds in research ensure

72
00:04:06,395 --> 00:04:08,618
that the data we generate is rigorous

73
00:04:09,178 --> 00:04:11,480
and can be trusted by the game development teams

74
00:04:11,801 --> 00:04:14,423
to affect all parts of game development.

75
00:04:16,305 --> 00:04:20,828
As a user experience researcher myself, I often find that player data means many things

76
00:04:20,848 --> 00:04:21,489
to many people.

77
00:04:21,569 --> 00:04:25,252
So before we hear from these case studies, let's talk about data.

78
00:04:27,593 --> 00:04:29,875
Player data is more than just analytics.

79
00:04:31,056 --> 00:04:32,297
It's more than just surveys.

80
00:04:32,717 --> 00:04:34,239
It's more than just app store comments.

81
00:04:34,839 --> 00:04:39,322
In fact, there are more than 30 formalized ways of getting data from players.

82
00:04:41,184 --> 00:04:45,207
Each of these information gathering techniques has strengths and weaknesses.

83
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,083
For example, analytics is fantastic at telling us

84
00:04:51,083 --> 00:04:53,885
what players did in our game, but it's often very poor

85
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,306
at telling us why they did that.

86
00:04:56,907 --> 00:04:58,989
Eye tracking is good for telling us where players

87
00:04:59,029 --> 00:05:00,870
were looking at the screen, but in isolation

88
00:05:00,930 --> 00:05:03,612
can't tell us whether they understood what they saw.

89
00:05:05,133 --> 00:05:08,336
The primary role of a games user experience researcher like us

90
00:05:08,836 --> 00:05:11,118
is to choose from these many research techniques

91
00:05:11,538 --> 00:05:13,940
and match them to the game development challenges you face.

92
00:05:15,769 --> 00:05:21,313
And it's a universal truth that using just one of these, only one, leads to blind spots.

93
00:05:22,414 --> 00:05:29,078
So it's not just ideal to use more than one, but necessary to get good data to inform design.

94
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:32,921
In research terms, each of these is called a method.

95
00:05:33,661 --> 00:05:37,644
And when we combine and triangulate using multiple sources of data, that's called mixed

96
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:38,165
methods.

97
00:05:40,733 --> 00:05:43,174
Here, we're talking about retention in this panel.

98
00:05:43,895 --> 00:05:47,556
So we'll be focusing on these research approaches, ones

99
00:05:47,596 --> 00:05:49,877
that are designed to gather data over long periods of time,

100
00:05:50,757 --> 00:05:53,038
that is rich, actionable, and useful to you.

101
00:05:53,578 --> 00:05:56,079
Although we'll touch on other methods as well.

102
00:05:59,941 --> 00:06:02,422
In each talk, you'll be hearing advice from these guys

103
00:06:02,902 --> 00:06:04,483
about why player data was needed,

104
00:06:05,543 --> 00:06:08,724
which methods were used, and the impact each of their studies

105
00:06:08,744 --> 00:06:09,425
had on their games.

106
00:06:10,593 --> 00:06:12,894
To help bring these learnings back to your own teams,

107
00:06:13,875 --> 00:06:16,356
I propose considering them through these four lenses.

108
00:06:17,697 --> 00:06:20,699
Firstly, consider how these studies were made rigorous.

109
00:06:21,399 --> 00:06:22,860
We captured sufficient data.

110
00:06:23,220 --> 00:06:25,041
We reduced biases in that data.

111
00:06:26,642 --> 00:06:28,103
Secondly, how they were made actionable,

112
00:06:28,743 --> 00:06:31,365
ensuring they informed specific design choices.

113
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:37,048
Thirdly, how they were made to be on time,

114
00:06:37,088 --> 00:06:38,169
these studies we're gonna hear about.

115
00:06:39,513 --> 00:06:42,175
How are they made to be done not just quickly, but cheaply,

116
00:06:42,396 --> 00:06:44,577
using resources we already had, and critically,

117
00:06:44,637 --> 00:06:46,218
at the right time during development?

118
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,521
And lastly, how they were made to be persuasive,

119
00:06:51,282 --> 00:06:52,783
to ensure that the data they generated

120
00:06:53,344 --> 00:06:56,726
was efficiently actioned by the development team.

121
00:06:58,027 --> 00:07:01,289
These four topics are the hallmarks of good player data.

122
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,293
OK, please allow me to introduce our first speaker.

123
00:07:07,013 --> 00:07:08,675
It's Alex Gehorst from Glue.

124
00:07:15,235 --> 00:07:16,616
Thank you all for this opportunity.

125
00:07:16,876 --> 00:07:18,998
It's a pleasure to be here and to share some insights

126
00:07:19,058 --> 00:07:21,721
that I, along with the teams at Glue and CrowdStar,

127
00:07:22,021 --> 00:07:23,583
learned in one of our projects last year,

128
00:07:23,883 --> 00:07:26,065
focused on understanding the first-time user experience

129
00:07:26,466 --> 00:07:27,407
and improving retention,

130
00:07:27,627 --> 00:07:29,469
specifically in our game, Design Home.

131
00:07:31,491 --> 00:07:34,033
Before diving into the details of this case study,

132
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:36,856
I wanted to share some background information

133
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:38,798
for anyone who may not be familiar with this game.

134
00:07:39,608 --> 00:07:41,989
Design Home is a free-to-play mobile game

135
00:07:42,069 --> 00:07:43,990
that gives its users opportunities to release

136
00:07:44,030 --> 00:07:44,930
through creative spirits,

137
00:07:45,210 --> 00:07:47,371
through interior decorating and designing.

138
00:07:48,312 --> 00:07:50,092
Through partnerships with many top brands,

139
00:07:50,432 --> 00:07:52,773
users are provided the opportunity to design spaces,

140
00:07:52,913 --> 00:07:55,194
including but not limited to living rooms,

141
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:56,734
dining rooms, and bedrooms,

142
00:07:57,175 --> 00:07:59,535
using furniture and decor that is representative

143
00:07:59,656 --> 00:08:00,216
of real life.

144
00:08:02,457 --> 00:08:04,197
To provide more context for this talk,

145
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,098
it's necessary to share some information

146
00:08:06,218 --> 00:08:07,758
about the core loop within Design Home.

147
00:08:08,732 --> 00:08:11,353
Design homes core loop is all about room design challenges.

148
00:08:11,873 --> 00:08:14,694
Players are presented with five or so challenges every day,

149
00:08:15,235 --> 00:08:16,955
and each challenge has its own description

150
00:08:16,995 --> 00:08:19,857
to prompt players with ideas about how to style a given room.

151
00:08:21,678 --> 00:08:22,918
These challenges can be separated

152
00:08:22,978 --> 00:08:26,160
into two main categories, those with design requirements

153
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:27,000
and those without.

154
00:08:28,354 --> 00:08:30,375
For example, in the House Hunters Challenge,

155
00:08:30,575 --> 00:08:33,375
that is shown on this slide, the perfect painted lady,

156
00:08:33,815 --> 00:08:35,276
players need to design a living room

157
00:08:35,536 --> 00:08:36,856
with eight required items

158
00:08:37,276 --> 00:08:39,336
and up to eight additional optional items.

159
00:08:39,997 --> 00:08:42,357
And players were required to design this room

160
00:08:42,497 --> 00:08:45,718
with four eclectic styled items along with a blue sofa.

161
00:08:48,798 --> 00:08:51,499
Last year, our research team worked hand in hand

162
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:53,079
with the design home team on a project

163
00:08:53,179 --> 00:08:55,380
aimed specifically to improve early day retention,

164
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,260
targeting days two through seven.

165
00:08:58,469 --> 00:09:03,013
Typically in free-to-play mobile games, you'll see retention curves similar to the one on

166
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:08,178
this slide, where there's high churn by day two, but with a flattening tail with each

167
00:09:08,218 --> 00:09:09,459
day after that.

168
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,844
Usually in free-to-play games, retention has a cascading effect, where the more users that

169
00:09:14,864 --> 00:09:18,007
are retained earlier on, the more users that are retained later.

170
00:09:18,687 --> 00:09:22,611
So using this chart as an example, if you were to improve day two retention from 35

171
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:22,871
to 40 percent.

172
00:09:24,982 --> 00:09:27,724
Retention on days three through seven should see improvements as well,

173
00:09:28,044 --> 00:09:30,806
which is exactly what we in the Design Home team were trying to do.

174
00:09:33,468 --> 00:09:38,951
So now that we knew that we wanted to improve our early day retention, how would we do that?

175
00:09:39,572 --> 00:09:44,055
We hypothesized that improvements to the first time user experience would address this,

176
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:47,197
and so the team designed and created a new Fatui,

177
00:09:47,657 --> 00:09:51,520
which would focus on teaching players core interactions earlier in their experience.

178
00:09:54,740 --> 00:09:57,202
For this project, we relied on two primary methods.

179
00:09:57,762 --> 00:10:00,264
The first was play testing, where we watched how players

180
00:10:00,324 --> 00:10:02,566
interacted with the first-time user experience design,

181
00:10:02,926 --> 00:10:06,148
noting any usability concerns, along with noting what players

182
00:10:06,208 --> 00:10:08,390
did upon reaching the core loop after the

183
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,351
onboarding process.

184
00:10:10,211 --> 00:10:12,713
In addition to this, the second method we relied on was

185
00:10:12,833 --> 00:10:15,575
A-B testing to compare different versions of the

186
00:10:15,595 --> 00:10:16,576
first-time user experience.

187
00:10:19,293 --> 00:10:23,399
For playtesting, we partnered with our vendor, Playtest Cloud, which allowed us to recruit

188
00:10:23,479 --> 00:10:27,625
our target audience, as well as to distribute builds and watch how players interacted with

189
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:28,806
different Fatui designs.

190
00:10:30,429 --> 00:10:35,696
We were able to recruit our target audience, which was casual gamers that had no previous

191
00:10:35,736 --> 00:10:36,697
design home experience.

192
00:10:39,358 --> 00:10:44,239
We asked that players would play Design Home for approximately 20 minutes, and we wanted

193
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:48,620
to see how players would go through their first session in a completely natural way

194
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,741
to assess how they interacted with the Vittui, as well as to see if they were able to recall

195
00:10:52,781 --> 00:10:55,422
what they learned once these players reached the core loop.

196
00:10:56,862 --> 00:11:01,564
Because we wanted a very natural gameplay, we provided no additional context and no additional

197
00:11:01,604 --> 00:11:05,965
tasks outside of the onboarding process and what was already in the tutorial flow.

198
00:11:09,787 --> 00:11:13,369
For this project, it was broken out into four phases,

199
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:16,272
three particularly that were focused on playtesting

200
00:11:16,352 --> 00:11:18,474
different iterations of the Vitui,

201
00:11:18,934 --> 00:11:20,335
as well as an A-B testing phase.

202
00:11:25,259 --> 00:11:27,541
When we tested the current design of the Vitui,

203
00:11:27,601 --> 00:11:29,342
we noted that we had two main issues.

204
00:11:30,003 --> 00:11:32,885
The first issue was that players didn't fully understand

205
00:11:32,925 --> 00:11:34,366
the context for designing rooms.

206
00:11:35,297 --> 00:11:37,778
And that players would place too much emphasis

207
00:11:38,078 --> 00:11:40,259
on certain keywords that were in the challenge descriptions.

208
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,001
In the example shown on this slide,

209
00:11:43,361 --> 00:11:44,902
the description told players to design

210
00:11:44,922 --> 00:11:46,142
an eco-friendly living room.

211
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:51,131
During testing, we witnessed several players become hyper-focused on this eco-friendly

212
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:51,551
keyword.

213
00:11:52,351 --> 00:11:55,832
We noticed that these players would scroll and scroll through furniture, endlessly looking

214
00:11:55,892 --> 00:12:00,374
for any sort of furniture item, whether it was a couch, a table, or a side table, that

215
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:05,335
was eco-friendly, even though within Design Home Game, none of these furniture items were

216
00:12:05,375 --> 00:12:07,376
tagged as being eco-friendly.

217
00:12:10,905 --> 00:12:15,066
The second issue that we witnessed was that players who moved on to other challenges did

218
00:12:15,106 --> 00:12:17,927
not notice that some of them had specific requirements.

219
00:12:18,727 --> 00:12:22,788
Players who did not notice the requirements would design some very beautiful rooms like

220
00:12:22,828 --> 00:12:27,309
the one in the slide, but unfortunately would be met with a notice that told them requirements

221
00:12:27,349 --> 00:12:29,750
had not been met when they went to submit their designs.

222
00:12:30,830 --> 00:12:35,451
Not only was this a very frustrating experience for these players, but what made matters worse

223
00:12:35,651 --> 00:12:39,472
was that these players had the potential to spend most, if not all, of their currency.

224
00:12:39,741 --> 00:12:41,765
The first prompt states that this is a game development transcript.

225
00:12:54,459 --> 00:12:58,840
We hypothesized that these issues stem from the short and straightforward design of the

226
00:12:58,860 --> 00:12:59,640
original Fatui.

227
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,361
Players were introduced to the game and taught how to choose and place furniture and decor

228
00:13:04,401 --> 00:13:09,163
within a room, but they are not taught specific aspects of the core loop, including requirements

229
00:13:09,323 --> 00:13:10,863
and designing within constraints.

230
00:13:12,723 --> 00:13:17,825
Based on this hypothesis, the team redesigned the Fatui to teach players additional fundamentals

231
00:13:17,845 --> 00:13:20,765
and interactions that they would encounter when reaching the core loop.

232
00:13:24,419 --> 00:13:27,042
In the new version of the first time user experience, the

233
00:13:27,082 --> 00:13:30,305
major change consisted of adding two new additional

234
00:13:30,345 --> 00:13:31,286
tutorial challenges.

235
00:13:32,728 --> 00:13:34,590
These additional challenges were added to teach players

236
00:13:34,630 --> 00:13:36,853
key features and interactions, including inventory

237
00:13:36,893 --> 00:13:39,496
management in the second challenge, and understanding

238
00:13:39,536 --> 00:13:42,099
challenge requirements and how to use filters to optimally

239
00:13:42,139 --> 00:13:43,881
find furniture in the third challenge.

240
00:13:48,172 --> 00:13:52,053
When the design home team was ready with the redesigned Fatui, we set certain criteria

241
00:13:52,293 --> 00:13:56,554
or success factors that players needed to demonstrate during playtesting before we would

242
00:13:56,614 --> 00:13:59,615
integrate this new Fatui design into the live game.

243
00:14:00,775 --> 00:14:04,616
The first success factor was that all players should notice requirements, and they should

244
00:14:04,676 --> 00:14:07,236
notice this before they try to submit a room design.

245
00:14:08,596 --> 00:14:12,597
The second success factor was that we wanted to see if players used filters to optimally

246
00:14:12,617 --> 00:14:15,738
refine furniture for the designs within any given challenge.

247
00:14:19,945 --> 00:14:22,607
When we tested the newly designed Fatui 2.0,

248
00:14:22,767 --> 00:14:24,929
we encountered the same requirements issue that we saw

249
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,911
when we originally tested the first design.

250
00:14:27,492 --> 00:14:29,634
Players were still not recognizing that challenges

251
00:14:29,694 --> 00:14:31,055
in the core loop had requirements,

252
00:14:31,555 --> 00:14:32,877
and they still weren't using filters

253
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:34,738
to optimally find furniture and decor.

254
00:14:36,940 --> 00:14:38,422
So why were players not recalling

255
00:14:38,562 --> 00:14:40,103
that there were requirements within challenges?

256
00:14:40,804 --> 00:14:43,666
We hypothesized that this issue was caused

257
00:14:43,707 --> 00:14:45,488
by the interaction design of the requirements

258
00:14:45,528 --> 00:14:46,409
and filters tutorial.

259
00:14:47,244 --> 00:14:51,926
Essentially, this tutorial was guiding players to specifically just press a button.

260
00:14:52,467 --> 00:14:56,048
They weren't really retaining information about filters or requirements, which is supposed

261
00:14:56,068 --> 00:14:59,370
to be the meaning behind that particular interaction.

262
00:15:02,271 --> 00:15:08,674
So the team iterated on the design, specifically the third tutorial challenge, and revised

263
00:15:08,714 --> 00:15:12,616
it to include a more granular approach to filtering, where players will walk through

264
00:15:12,876 --> 00:15:15,958
the individual steps of seeing that the room has requirements.

265
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:22,041
Opening the filters menu, noticing the variety of filters available such as brand, color,

266
00:15:22,101 --> 00:15:27,062
style and even the classier requirements filter options to streamline their experience and

267
00:15:27,102 --> 00:15:30,963
then finally removing the filter once they had already met the requirements.

268
00:15:33,164 --> 00:15:38,125
After making these changes and retesting the design, all players within the playtest demonstrated

269
00:15:38,185 --> 00:15:39,985
understanding of filters and requirements.

270
00:15:41,511 --> 00:15:45,353
At this time, the team had also addressed some other issues that are outside of the

271
00:15:45,373 --> 00:15:49,515
scope of this talk, but it was at this point that we felt confident in the design and we

272
00:15:49,555 --> 00:15:51,316
wanted to release this to our player base.

273
00:15:55,678 --> 00:15:57,839
So after making these changes and retesting the design...

274
00:16:01,559 --> 00:16:04,861
So at this point, the team set up an A-B test

275
00:16:05,081 --> 00:16:06,923
with two different versions of the Fatui.

276
00:16:07,503 --> 00:16:10,045
And to mitigate risks, traffic in the live game

277
00:16:10,085 --> 00:16:12,788
was split with 95% of our new users

278
00:16:13,228 --> 00:16:14,709
going to the old Fatui design

279
00:16:14,829 --> 00:16:17,792
and 5% receiving the new Fatui variation.

280
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,335
And if positive performance was recorded during the A-B test,

281
00:16:21,375 --> 00:16:24,557
we planned to increase traffic to the new Fatui.

282
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:29,545
The Data PM team on Design Home then tracked retention rates,

283
00:16:30,405 --> 00:16:31,866
specifically looking at different cohorts,

284
00:16:32,066 --> 00:16:35,468
and also implemented event tags to track how many users

285
00:16:35,488 --> 00:16:37,309
were reaching each step of the Fatui.

286
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,913
Diving into the data, what we saw when we measured

287
00:16:42,953 --> 00:16:45,954
day two retention was that we had significant lifts

288
00:16:46,295 --> 00:16:49,877
across all day two cohorts, suggesting that the redesign

289
00:16:49,897 --> 00:16:52,358
to the Fatui created a better user experience

290
00:16:52,638 --> 00:16:53,459
that retained players.

291
00:16:57,527 --> 00:17:02,070
When we evaluated retention at day seven, we saw a slight

292
00:17:02,370 --> 00:17:05,492
decrease from the lift scene in day two, which makes sense

293
00:17:05,512 --> 00:17:07,733
as other factors, such as economy design and weather

294
00:17:07,773 --> 00:17:10,075
players are progressing, could be having more influence at

295
00:17:10,115 --> 00:17:10,515
this point.

296
00:17:10,975 --> 00:17:14,237
But we still saw significant lifts in retention at day

297
00:17:14,277 --> 00:17:14,998
seven as well.

298
00:17:20,942 --> 00:17:23,583
I mentioned previously that we implemented event tagging to

299
00:17:23,623 --> 00:17:26,505
do granular tracking and funnel tracking during Fatui.

300
00:17:27,317 --> 00:17:31,759
Anytime you're testing a first-time user experience, tracking each step of the funnel will uncover

301
00:17:31,899 --> 00:17:36,202
insights on which areas can be addressed that will also have the largest impacts to potentially

302
00:17:36,262 --> 00:17:37,002
retaining players.

303
00:17:38,363 --> 00:17:43,445
In our case study, during A-B testing, we uncovered two major churn points, which happened

304
00:17:43,465 --> 00:17:47,107
to correlate with two usability issues that we saw during player testing.

305
00:17:47,922 --> 00:17:51,925
Unfortunately, due to the time constraints of this talk, I can't elaborate on these.

306
00:17:52,425 --> 00:17:57,329
However, the point I would like you all to take away is that by playtesting the first-time

307
00:17:57,409 --> 00:18:01,893
user experience design before implementing this in the live game, we were able to have

308
00:18:02,033 --> 00:18:04,815
insight into what was causing these turnpoints in the funnel.

309
00:18:05,496 --> 00:18:09,739
The team had specific direction that they could take with data to further improve the

310
00:18:09,779 --> 00:18:13,442
first-time user experience, which would then incrementally improve retention.

311
00:18:16,592 --> 00:18:19,893
So in summary, by taking a test, iterate, and retest

312
00:18:19,933 --> 00:18:23,214
approach with the first time user experience, we were able

313
00:18:23,234 --> 00:18:26,635
to prove early day retention both at day two and day seven

314
00:18:26,975 --> 00:18:29,496
by targeting specific areas within the first time user

315
00:18:29,516 --> 00:18:29,896
experience.

316
00:18:33,217 --> 00:18:33,877
So thank you all.

317
00:18:34,037 --> 00:18:35,658
And at this time, I would like to introduce our

318
00:18:35,698 --> 00:18:36,558
next speaker, Molly.

319
00:18:45,769 --> 00:18:57,098
Hello everyone. My name is Molly Sarota. I'm the lead researcher at the Sony San Diego studio and I'm going to continue our talk on retention.

320
00:18:58,378 --> 00:19:10,848
Okay, so specifically what I'm going to talk about is leveraging a method known as a diary study to study retention and I just want to get a feel for the room. How many people raise your hands if you're not a researcher.

321
00:19:12,496 --> 00:19:19,099
Okay, it'll help me understand how to articulate what we do at the San Diego studio.

322
00:19:19,540 --> 00:19:24,002
So this is going to be a high-level view of how to run a diary study, but then I'll get

323
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:24,923
into the details.

324
00:19:25,443 --> 00:19:29,825
So in the beginning, you're going to recruit a handful of users.

325
00:19:29,905 --> 00:19:32,807
It'll depend on your game and what your question is.

326
00:19:33,227 --> 00:19:39,190
For us, we typically recruit around 50 people, a mix of spenders and non-spenders, a mix

327
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:41,931
of first-time users and experienced users.

328
00:19:42,984 --> 00:19:51,327
And we send them a virtual diary, which is pretty much a survey link, but it's not a survey, it's an open diary.

329
00:19:52,068 --> 00:20:00,872
And users play your game, then enter feedback in this virtual diary, and then you read the feedback that's coming in.

330
00:20:01,329 --> 00:20:02,830
And then that loop continues.

331
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:04,751
They play your game, they give feedback

332
00:20:04,771 --> 00:20:06,131
through this virtual diary.

333
00:20:06,531 --> 00:20:08,672
You monitor data that's coming in.

334
00:20:09,072 --> 00:20:13,914
And the benefit of a diary study is that it is leveraged

335
00:20:14,035 --> 00:20:17,876
to see how your game plays out or unfolds for the user

336
00:20:18,336 --> 00:20:20,317
over an extended period of time.

337
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:22,338
So depending on your question,

338
00:20:22,378 --> 00:20:25,680
some people run diary studies for a few days or a week.

339
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,881
We have a tendency to run diary studies

340
00:20:28,981 --> 00:20:30,221
for three to four months.

341
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,101
And that's because I work on a baseball game, MLB The Show.

342
00:20:35,741 --> 00:20:38,721
And what we're trying to do is capture our audience

343
00:20:38,901 --> 00:20:42,342
for as long of the baseball season as we can.

344
00:20:42,802 --> 00:20:46,623
But there are other benefits to running a longer diary study.

345
00:20:47,023 --> 00:20:50,724
For one, you only spend money the first time

346
00:20:50,764 --> 00:20:52,604
you recruit people to this study.

347
00:20:52,984 --> 00:20:56,585
And now you have a user base to constantly tap

348
00:20:56,645 --> 00:20:59,886
into any time questions come up in your studio

349
00:20:59,946 --> 00:21:00,666
about your game.

350
00:21:01,795 --> 00:21:05,937
So let me get into kind of the details behind a diary study.

351
00:21:06,977 --> 00:21:16,260
For one your diary study is it gets at really the end benefit

352
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:19,041
is that extended period of time.

353
00:21:20,108 --> 00:21:25,913
To outline it is you're encouraging your users to enter data on a daily-ish basis.

354
00:21:25,993 --> 00:21:30,818
Really it's just whenever they're playing their game, your game, and it's any time that

355
00:21:30,858 --> 00:21:33,700
they're playing your game in their own environment.

356
00:21:33,820 --> 00:21:39,085
You're not bringing users into your studio or into your office to test.

357
00:21:39,145 --> 00:21:43,229
They are playing in their own environment and giving you feedback when they're actually

358
00:21:43,309 --> 00:21:44,290
experiencing it.

359
00:21:45,248 --> 00:21:51,050
The other thing with diary studies is that as a researcher, you're giving them a suggestion

360
00:21:51,110 --> 00:21:56,952
of a topic to think about for the diary, like gameplay or customization.

361
00:21:57,292 --> 00:22:03,394
But other than that, it's up to the user to then decide what aspect of customization or

362
00:22:03,434 --> 00:22:04,815
gameplay they're going to discuss.

363
00:22:05,775 --> 00:22:11,877
And the benefit of this is instead of using a survey where you're specifying the topic

364
00:22:11,917 --> 00:22:13,658
that users have to give feedback on.

365
00:22:14,206 --> 00:22:19,188
You're now getting feedback on what's most important to the user in their experience.

366
00:22:19,828 --> 00:22:23,830
And the strength of this is that sometimes when you're designing a survey,

367
00:22:24,130 --> 00:22:28,072
you are selfishly putting in questions on topics that you want feedback on,

368
00:22:28,572 --> 00:22:33,554
but you might not realize that there are other topics affecting the user experience

369
00:22:33,574 --> 00:22:35,915
that you didn't even know to ask a question on.

370
00:22:36,236 --> 00:22:38,657
And that's another beauty of a diary study.

371
00:22:40,417 --> 00:22:43,979
The other thing is that you are getting real-time feedback.

372
00:22:44,809 --> 00:22:46,650
on the user's actual experience.

373
00:22:46,710 --> 00:22:51,152
When you bring users on site to your studio,

374
00:22:51,432 --> 00:22:54,934
you are trying to simulate a gamer experience.

375
00:22:55,254 --> 00:22:56,855
With a diary study, they're allowed

376
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:59,857
to play on their own time in their own environment.

377
00:23:00,097 --> 00:23:03,519
So you're getting feedback on their actual experience

378
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:06,840
in their real world environment.

379
00:23:09,289 --> 00:23:14,151
Now as was previously mentioned, with any research method there's strengths and weaknesses.

380
00:23:14,572 --> 00:23:19,234
So this is going to be an outline of how you can strengthen the areas of a diary study

381
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:22,155
that have some blind spots.

382
00:23:22,836 --> 00:23:29,219
So one thing about a diary study is that it might not always address the topic that you

383
00:23:29,239 --> 00:23:30,720
were hoping people would discuss.

384
00:23:31,294 --> 00:23:33,976
For example, again, I work on a baseball video game.

385
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:38,179
Maybe there's some discussions that day in my office where

386
00:23:38,239 --> 00:23:40,081
people want to know is something going on with

387
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:42,723
hitting, are people struggling with hitting.

388
00:23:43,063 --> 00:23:45,425
And then I look at the diary feedback and everybody's

389
00:23:45,465 --> 00:23:46,405
talking about pitching.

390
00:23:47,466 --> 00:23:50,268
You have already recruited this panel of users.

391
00:23:50,528 --> 00:23:52,430
You don't have to pay to re-recruit.

392
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:54,992
You don't have to wait to find the people.

393
00:23:55,592 --> 00:23:57,273
They're already available to you.

394
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:04,432
So you can quickly send out a survey with closed-ended questions that get at any area

395
00:24:04,572 --> 00:24:08,295
in the diary study that was missed from hearing from people.

396
00:24:09,356 --> 00:24:13,820
The other thing about diary studies is that it depends on the participant in terms of

397
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:17,203
how articulate they are in the feedback that they give you.

398
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:23,214
So there are times where their information can be vague or just misunderstood.

399
00:24:23,595 --> 00:24:28,337
And let's say you're reading diary feedback coming in and you can see that people are

400
00:24:28,457 --> 00:24:33,439
struggling with a certain aspect of gameplay, but you can't exactly tell why.

401
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:37,420
Again, these people are already recruited, they're already available to you.

402
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:38,401
Hop on the phone.

403
00:24:38,966 --> 00:24:41,227
You can call these people and ask more detail.

404
00:24:41,567 --> 00:24:45,948
You can hop on Skype and have them video stream gameplay

405
00:24:46,008 --> 00:24:47,449
if you need to see what they're doing.

406
00:24:47,869 --> 00:24:50,550
If they're local, you can bring them into the office

407
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:53,071
at this point and get follow-up feedback

408
00:24:53,171 --> 00:24:55,812
on where the issue is actually occurring for them.

409
00:24:57,253 --> 00:25:01,594
The other aspect of a diary study and really with any type

410
00:25:01,714 --> 00:25:03,255
of qualitative research.

411
00:25:03,862 --> 00:25:08,626
is that you can't tell the frequency at which it is happening, and that's because the sample

412
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,746
sizes are smaller.

413
00:25:10,167 --> 00:25:15,451
So again, I said that we typically recruit 40 to 50 people for our diary studies, but

414
00:25:15,571 --> 00:25:17,392
we have millions of players.

415
00:25:17,753 --> 00:25:22,056
So it's not going to tell us at what frequency is this issue occurring.

416
00:25:22,376 --> 00:25:25,339
For how many of our users is this issue occurring?

417
00:25:25,899 --> 00:25:31,484
So if in your diaries you're seeing that people are struggling getting into a certain area

418
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:32,645
if you're in your game.

419
00:25:33,223 --> 00:25:39,929
Then reflect back on telemetry data so that you can see to what degree is this impacting

420
00:25:40,169 --> 00:25:41,791
everybody who's playing our game.

421
00:25:43,873 --> 00:25:49,998
So now I'm going to get into specifically what we've done with MLB The Show to study

422
00:25:50,258 --> 00:25:50,899
retention.

423
00:25:51,399 --> 00:25:55,363
So MLB The Show is a game that releases once a year.

424
00:25:56,028 --> 00:26:10,407
But we do have live content that we release every few weeks in the form of baseball themed events and the whole purpose of these baseball themed events is to offer new and different ways for users to play our games.

425
00:26:10,847 --> 00:26:13,709
So that they continue to play our game.

426
00:26:14,209 --> 00:26:16,591
What's shown up here is an example of one of the events

427
00:26:16,631 --> 00:26:17,952
that we put out to users.

428
00:26:18,332 --> 00:26:20,954
And it encouraged users to build a baseball team

429
00:26:21,935 --> 00:26:24,096
made up of just baseball players

430
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,338
that are of the age of 25 or under.

431
00:26:26,738 --> 00:26:28,719
Then they go online and play against users

432
00:26:28,739 --> 00:26:30,440
who have created similar teams.

433
00:26:32,702 --> 00:26:36,244
So again, the point of these events for MLB The Show

434
00:26:36,925 --> 00:26:38,666
is to enhance retention.

435
00:26:39,892 --> 00:26:44,016
So as a researcher, I come in with a diary study to see,

436
00:26:45,057 --> 00:26:45,697
is it working?

437
00:26:46,138 --> 00:26:49,741
Are we actually retaining people with these events?

438
00:26:50,121 --> 00:26:51,743
And if not, why not?

439
00:26:53,944 --> 00:26:56,126
So let me talk you through what happened

440
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:57,568
in the beginning of our study.

441
00:26:58,148 --> 00:27:01,491
So the 25 and under event was the very first event

442
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:04,514
that we launched with the launch of our game.

443
00:27:05,479 --> 00:27:11,622
And what happened in the diary feedback that we started getting is people were talking

444
00:27:11,662 --> 00:27:16,364
about the theme of creating a baseball team with baseball players who were of the age

445
00:27:16,404 --> 00:27:18,465
of 25 and under, and they liked it.

446
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:18,985
Great.

447
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:21,166
Motivated just to check out the event.

448
00:27:21,226 --> 00:27:21,907
We want that.

449
00:27:22,487 --> 00:27:23,748
They liked the rewards.

450
00:27:23,808 --> 00:27:25,028
They wanted the rewards.

451
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:25,689
Great.

452
00:27:26,009 --> 00:27:29,831
We're still working towards retention because we're capturing people's interest.

453
00:27:30,651 --> 00:27:32,532
But from there on out, we kind of went downhill.

454
00:27:33,638 --> 00:27:38,040
Users started to try and create a team of baseball players

455
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,982
that were of the age of 25 or under

456
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:41,903
and could not for the life of them

457
00:27:42,043 --> 00:27:43,524
figure out how old people were.

458
00:27:44,144 --> 00:27:47,186
This information was, you had to dig,

459
00:27:47,486 --> 00:27:50,768
really dig on a player by player basis

460
00:27:51,088 --> 00:27:52,769
to find out how old they were.

461
00:27:53,669 --> 00:27:56,771
And so it got to the point where users gave up.

462
00:27:57,552 --> 00:27:59,333
We thought we were gonna be getting data

463
00:27:59,553 --> 00:28:01,614
in the diary study on gameplay.

464
00:28:02,248 --> 00:28:07,270
How did this theme or this particular experience play out for users?

465
00:28:07,610 --> 00:28:09,771
Did they keep playing to get more rewards?

466
00:28:09,791 --> 00:28:11,132
Were we keeping their attention?

467
00:28:12,212 --> 00:28:15,213
And then we found out people couldn't even get in to play the event.

468
00:28:16,514 --> 00:28:18,655
So what do we do with that type of information?

469
00:28:19,275 --> 00:28:24,217
We create the next event off of everything that we learned from the previous event.

470
00:28:25,657 --> 00:28:26,598
So what we did was

471
00:28:28,188 --> 00:28:32,790
One thing that happened with the first event is that it launched with the beginning launch

472
00:28:32,910 --> 00:28:39,151
of our game, which means that our user space inventory was very small at that point.

473
00:28:39,591 --> 00:28:44,672
Even if they could figure out how old baseball players were, they didn't have a lot of their

474
00:28:44,832 --> 00:28:51,494
own inventory to pull from, which means we're suddenly pushing a lot of people to the marketplace,

475
00:28:51,814 --> 00:28:53,875
which was not going over well with people.

476
00:28:54,690 --> 00:29:00,774
So we changed the second event to work better with the inventory that users already had

477
00:29:00,814 --> 00:29:01,814
available to them.

478
00:29:02,315 --> 00:29:08,519
The second event had users build up a baseball team that had to do with right-handed hitters

479
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:09,739
and left-handed pitchers.

480
00:29:10,400 --> 00:29:16,484
This is something that the designers know is very easy for users to do at an early stage

481
00:29:16,524 --> 00:29:17,905
in our release of our game.

482
00:29:19,574 --> 00:29:24,658
The other thing that they did with the data that came in from the diary study is they

483
00:29:24,818 --> 00:29:31,684
put out a patch to quickly address this aspect of having no idea which players to build your

484
00:29:31,724 --> 00:29:35,527
baseball team off of because they don't know who qualifies and who doesn't.

485
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:42,593
Well now there's an icon that goes on any player within the baseball game that identifies

486
00:29:42,653 --> 00:29:44,314
them for the event going on.

487
00:29:44,752 --> 00:29:50,235
The second that event closes, that icon goes away and then comes back up on any player

488
00:29:50,295 --> 00:29:54,877
that then matches the qualifications for the next event that opens up.

489
00:29:55,818 --> 00:29:57,338
The other thing that designers did

490
00:29:57,695 --> 00:30:02,096
was they leveraged information that the user was going to need to build their baseball

491
00:30:02,136 --> 00:30:06,258
team with aspects that were front and center on a baseball card.

492
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:11,340
Whether a baseball player is left-handed or right-handed, it's on the front of a baseball

493
00:30:11,380 --> 00:30:11,660
card.

494
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:15,682
This was information that was going to be easy for the users to identify.

495
00:30:17,702 --> 00:30:23,365
And what ended up happening is at this point, we're seeing positive feedback coming in through

496
00:30:23,385 --> 00:30:25,185
the diary study when comparing

497
00:30:25,902 --> 00:30:28,763
When comparing how their experience went with the first event.

498
00:30:29,383 --> 00:30:33,564
But we also look at telemetry data and we see that we've more than doubled the amount

499
00:30:33,604 --> 00:30:37,865
of people who are able to actually get into the event in the first place.

500
00:30:41,386 --> 00:30:47,487
So in sum, the thing with diary studies is that it allows you to study your users and

501
00:30:47,507 --> 00:30:51,788
your gameplay experience over an extended period of time.

502
00:30:52,188 --> 00:30:55,689
So that even if your game is testing well when you bring them

503
00:30:56,165 --> 00:31:00,286
on site for a play test, for an eight-hour play test, a two-day play test.

504
00:31:00,726 --> 00:31:06,748
A diary study allows you to see how your game experience unfolds over time and to not only

505
00:31:06,848 --> 00:31:13,389
identify where people are dropping off, but why people are dropping off of your game.

506
00:31:13,849 --> 00:31:19,631
And for us, it allowed us to quickly iterate so that we could minimize the amount of people

507
00:31:19,671 --> 00:31:22,892
that we were losing and therefore impact.

508
00:31:23,285 --> 00:31:26,546
that our ability to retain users' attention,

509
00:31:26,846 --> 00:31:28,887
to retain users' interest in our game.

510
00:31:30,267 --> 00:31:32,368
And with that, I will now introduce Jen.

511
00:31:32,388 --> 00:31:34,869
Hi everyone.

512
00:31:34,889 --> 00:31:35,889
My name is Jennifer Torson

513
00:31:35,909 --> 00:31:37,110
and I am a user researcher over at Scopely.

514
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:37,930
I'm a user researcher at Scopely.

515
00:31:37,950 --> 00:31:46,393
I'm a user researcher at Scopely.

516
00:31:46,453 --> 00:31:48,074
I'm a user researcher at Scopely.

517
00:31:48,114 --> 00:31:49,094
I'm a user researcher at Scopely.

518
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:51,755
I'm a user researcher at Scopely.

519
00:31:52,808 --> 00:31:57,391
Scopely is the publisher of free-to-play mobile games and we have a really diverse portfolio

520
00:31:57,471 --> 00:32:00,832
from casual word games to RPGs to 4X strategy.

521
00:32:01,673 --> 00:32:05,574
Research is a really important part of the development process at Scopely and we have

522
00:32:05,614 --> 00:32:10,076
a team of very serious and professional researchers working on all of our titles.

523
00:32:11,955 --> 00:32:16,861
At Scopely, our research team works to deliver actionable insights at every stage of development,

524
00:32:17,001 --> 00:32:20,044
from early concept to live operations.

525
00:32:20,725 --> 00:32:25,270
Because of this, we believe in researching games holistically, trying to understand how

526
00:32:25,550 --> 00:32:30,055
every facet of the game contributes to its overall long-term experience.

527
00:32:31,969 --> 00:32:34,590
One of the ways we do this is by running longitudinal,

528
00:32:34,770 --> 00:32:37,591
or long-term, studies, where we conduct research

529
00:32:37,631 --> 00:32:41,131
that looks at play experiences over a span of days or weeks

530
00:32:41,291 --> 00:32:42,552
rather than a single session.

531
00:32:43,452 --> 00:32:44,752
While that may sound like it would take

532
00:32:44,792 --> 00:32:46,633
a huge amount of work, the reality is

533
00:32:46,693 --> 00:32:48,993
long-term studies are easy to set up and run.

534
00:32:49,594 --> 00:32:52,494
They only need an extra day or two of research or time

535
00:32:52,574 --> 00:32:54,455
than a traditional usability test would,

536
00:32:54,955 --> 00:32:56,595
and the benefits are huge, giving us

537
00:32:56,715 --> 00:32:58,456
really deep insights into the game.

538
00:32:59,475 --> 00:33:03,699
Today I'm going to talk about two cases where we use these tests for great results.

539
00:33:04,359 --> 00:33:08,343
First we're going to look at Star Trek Fleet Command, our mobile 4X strategy game.

540
00:33:09,884 --> 00:33:14,688
During that game's development we used longitudinal testing to understand player motivations

541
00:33:14,768 --> 00:33:16,209
and progression during the first week.

542
00:33:16,990 --> 00:33:21,174
Next we'll look at The Walking Dead Road to Survival where we tested post-launch to

543
00:33:21,234 --> 00:33:27,199
redesign the way we taught players about characters during the tutorial to help increase retention

544
00:33:27,219 --> 00:33:27,679
down the line.

545
00:33:29,894 --> 00:33:36,461
So longitudinal studies at Scopely typically take place in three phases and use a variety

546
00:33:36,701 --> 00:33:38,483
of qualitative research methods.

547
00:33:40,327 --> 00:33:42,768
The first phase is an on-site usability test.

548
00:33:43,008 --> 00:33:44,708
These are pretty standard sessions

549
00:33:44,768 --> 00:33:46,429
that are widely used in the industry.

550
00:33:46,949 --> 00:33:49,890
We recruit about six people to come into our office

551
00:33:49,990 --> 00:33:51,411
and play the game one-on-one

552
00:33:51,491 --> 00:33:53,232
while a moderator sits beside them

553
00:33:53,912 --> 00:33:55,773
to observe and talk about their experience.

554
00:33:56,393 --> 00:33:58,614
And this is where we can capture initial impressions

555
00:33:59,014 --> 00:34:01,235
about the game as well as any usability issues

556
00:34:01,295 --> 00:34:02,916
that come up during the first hour of play.

557
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:07,034
Our second phase of testing is a diary study.

558
00:34:07,695 --> 00:34:09,696
So after they finish their usability session,

559
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:11,738
we send players home with the game installed

560
00:34:11,778 --> 00:34:14,961
on their personal phones and ask them to play every day

561
00:34:15,121 --> 00:34:17,043
for the course of a week or two weeks,

562
00:34:17,483 --> 00:34:19,405
usually about 30 to 60 minutes a day.

563
00:34:19,945 --> 00:34:22,507
We might let them do this as self-directed free play

564
00:34:22,567 --> 00:34:24,969
if we want them to just kind of test the overall experience,

565
00:34:25,150 --> 00:34:27,632
or we might ask them to do specific tasks every day,

566
00:34:27,972 --> 00:34:29,513
just kind of depending on what we're trying to look at.

567
00:34:30,847 --> 00:34:34,831
Players are then sent a survey via email every evening

568
00:34:34,971 --> 00:34:37,293
and asked to record their experiences from the day.

569
00:34:37,813 --> 00:34:40,155
What they did, how they felt about the game,

570
00:34:40,216 --> 00:34:42,237
if they were ever confused, things like that.

571
00:34:43,238 --> 00:34:45,861
These are generally very broad, open-ended questions

572
00:34:45,941 --> 00:34:48,383
just to get the player to give us as much detail as possible

573
00:34:48,443 --> 00:34:50,465
without us guiding their responses too much.

574
00:34:52,768 --> 00:34:55,509
The final phase of testing is a follow-up interview

575
00:34:55,569 --> 00:34:57,569
where players come back to the studio

576
00:34:57,649 --> 00:34:59,610
to show us the progress they made in the game.

577
00:35:00,350 --> 00:35:01,670
We prepare for the interview

578
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:04,271
by reading their diary entries every day,

579
00:35:04,711 --> 00:35:06,971
and that really helps us to plan more in-depth

580
00:35:07,091 --> 00:35:09,592
and specific questions that really dig

581
00:35:09,632 --> 00:35:12,113
into the nuances of the player's experience.

582
00:35:12,913 --> 00:35:15,574
Taken as a whole, these three phases allow us

583
00:35:15,654 --> 00:35:18,394
to see the effects of various issues over time

584
00:35:18,754 --> 00:35:21,755
and to better suggest how to fix them for long-term results.

585
00:35:23,470 --> 00:35:24,930
So the first case study is gonna be

586
00:35:25,011 --> 00:35:26,411
from Star Trek Fleet Command.

587
00:35:26,451 --> 00:35:28,232
Again, this is our mobile 4X strategy game.

588
00:35:29,233 --> 00:35:30,413
When we did this testing,

589
00:35:30,453 --> 00:35:32,134
Fleet Command was still in development.

590
00:35:32,214 --> 00:35:33,615
We had no idea at that point

591
00:35:33,695 --> 00:35:35,936
how players were going to be engaging with the game

592
00:35:36,076 --> 00:35:37,597
or what their first week was going to look like.

593
00:35:39,318 --> 00:35:42,079
One of the features in the game is a mission system.

594
00:35:42,239 --> 00:35:43,620
So a series of ongoing quests

595
00:35:44,040 --> 00:35:45,981
that we designed initially to help players

596
00:35:46,702 --> 00:35:47,922
learn about the game fundamentals

597
00:35:48,062 --> 00:35:50,984
and then later to give them reasons to keep coming back

598
00:35:51,024 --> 00:35:52,585
and getting into more difficult content.

599
00:35:54,280 --> 00:35:57,182
Our design team wanted to know if the system was working as intended.

600
00:35:57,483 --> 00:35:59,204
Players understand the mission system.

601
00:35:59,244 --> 00:36:00,425
Were they motivated by them?

602
00:36:01,265 --> 00:36:06,109
So we decided to use a longitudinal test to see how players were actually going to experience

603
00:36:06,149 --> 00:36:06,589
the system.

604
00:36:08,402 --> 00:36:13,565
The first days of the study, the on-site usability testing, was the first hour of play, and we

605
00:36:13,625 --> 00:36:15,286
had really good results that first day.

606
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:20,409
We found some usability issues, such as with iconography, a few places where we were using

607
00:36:20,449 --> 00:36:25,171
jargon, but overall players were able to understand and complete their missions.

608
00:36:26,492 --> 00:36:29,654
So that first 45 minutes of play were really solid.

609
00:36:30,294 --> 00:36:33,676
So then we shifted our attention to the next seven days' experience.

610
00:36:35,836 --> 00:36:40,643
A few days into the second phase, we started to see some issues popping up that we hadn't

611
00:36:40,743 --> 00:36:41,404
anticipated.

612
00:36:41,424 --> 00:36:46,331
In their nightly diary entries, players started to talk about how they were frustrated with

613
00:36:46,371 --> 00:36:51,098
how difficult the missions were becoming and how they were left with nothing meaningful

614
00:36:51,138 --> 00:36:53,341
to do while they were trying to grind the materials.

615
00:36:53,751 --> 00:36:55,632
or levels they needed to complete those quests.

616
00:36:56,452 --> 00:36:58,713
And by the end of the week, they were also reporting

617
00:36:58,753 --> 00:37:00,174
that the missions felt repetitive,

618
00:37:00,554 --> 00:37:02,715
since they follow a pretty standard formula,

619
00:37:02,795 --> 00:37:04,436
kill 10 of this, gather 20 of that,

620
00:37:05,257 --> 00:37:06,837
and they really wanted something to mix it up.

621
00:37:07,518 --> 00:37:08,598
And we knew that these could turn

622
00:37:08,638 --> 00:37:10,279
into really big problems over time.

623
00:37:10,679 --> 00:37:12,480
Players who feel like they can't progress

624
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,661
or who are just bored

625
00:37:13,761 --> 00:37:15,141
are not gonna stay around in your game.

626
00:37:17,464 --> 00:37:22,309
So when players returned for their follow-up interviews, we really dug into the issues

627
00:37:22,349 --> 00:37:24,071
and what we might be able to do to help them.

628
00:37:24,712 --> 00:37:28,396
And from these conversations, we decided a good solution would be to branch out from

629
00:37:28,416 --> 00:37:32,101
the mission system and provide additional ways that players could engage with the game.

630
00:37:33,508 --> 00:37:39,012
First, in addition to daily missions, we added daily goals as a way to give players easily

631
00:37:39,052 --> 00:37:44,335
achievable quests that could be repeated daily for good rewards, giving players stuck at

632
00:37:44,355 --> 00:37:49,058
a difficulty wall in missions a meaningful way to get the materials they needed to progress.

633
00:37:50,832 --> 00:37:56,180
Next, we updated events, which we had planned as a late game feature for elder players to

634
00:37:56,220 --> 00:37:58,363
be available right from the beginning of the game.

635
00:37:58,904 --> 00:38:03,551
These limited time events are always changing, which helped relieve the repetition that players

636
00:38:03,571 --> 00:38:04,272
were starting to feel.

637
00:38:06,290 --> 00:38:11,053
This solution of adding more ways to play not only helped to solve the issues that we'd

638
00:38:11,073 --> 00:38:16,697
seen with missions, but continued to benefit players long-term through rewarding multiple

639
00:38:16,737 --> 00:38:17,698
kinds of engagement.

640
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:23,081
It also gave our developers multiple ways to introduce new features into the existing

641
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:24,602
loop after the game went live.

642
00:38:26,443 --> 00:38:31,327
Now the second case study is from the Walking Dead Road to Survival, and this is our RPG.

643
00:38:32,584 --> 00:38:37,447
After the game had been live for a while, the game team decided that the early retention

644
00:38:37,487 --> 00:38:38,928
was not where they wanted it to be.

645
00:38:40,509 --> 00:38:45,553
We looked at the analytics from players' first weeks and realized that our players were not

646
00:38:45,613 --> 00:38:48,575
progressing through the story campaign as quickly as they should.

647
00:38:48,675 --> 00:38:51,457
They were losing battles that they should have been easily winning.

648
00:38:52,758 --> 00:38:57,322
Our hypothesis was that these losses were causing player frustration and churn, which

649
00:38:57,342 --> 00:38:58,823
was explaining our low retention.

650
00:38:59,667 --> 00:39:04,249
We guessed that the most likely cause for losing battles was using characters incorrectly.

651
00:39:04,669 --> 00:39:10,972
So we decided to use a longitudinal study to see how players were actually using and understanding their characters during that first week.

652
00:39:12,813 --> 00:39:16,534
Phase one seemed to go really well. During the on-site usability test,

653
00:39:17,254 --> 00:39:20,896
players went through the tutorial and a bit of free play and during this time

654
00:39:20,956 --> 00:39:24,397
they were able to articulate the key points that we were trying to teach about the characters.

655
00:39:24,757 --> 00:39:27,098
That you can get new characters and that you can level them up.

656
00:39:29,315 --> 00:39:33,318
We sent players home with the game and as they started to fill out their daily diary

657
00:39:33,358 --> 00:39:37,481
entries, we realized that our tutorial had not been as successful as it seemed.

658
00:39:38,142 --> 00:39:41,764
Our players wrote that they were frustrated by losing battles and progressing slowly,

659
00:39:42,044 --> 00:39:43,746
just like we'd seen with the analytics data.

660
00:39:43,766 --> 00:39:49,129
And when they returned for their follow-up interviews, we looked at their characters

661
00:39:49,169 --> 00:39:50,931
and our suspicions were totally confirmed.

662
00:39:50,991 --> 00:39:53,793
They were using far weaker teams than they could have been.

663
00:39:56,130 --> 00:39:58,170
Through all of the phases of our testing,

664
00:39:58,270 --> 00:40:00,671
players were able to understand and recall

665
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,511
the major points of our character tutorial,

666
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,231
winning new powerful characters

667
00:40:04,711 --> 00:40:07,032
and improving them through leveling up and evolving.

668
00:40:08,172 --> 00:40:10,193
But from their interviews and their diaries,

669
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,233
what we realized is they didn't remember

670
00:40:12,413 --> 00:40:14,834
how to tell which were the powerful characters

671
00:40:14,854 --> 00:40:15,994
that they should be focusing on.

672
00:40:18,054 --> 00:40:20,175
So the first problem we found was when players

673
00:40:20,215 --> 00:40:22,975
won their new, more powerful character during the tutorial.

674
00:40:23,874 --> 00:40:26,174
During the test, players win Dr. Stevens.

675
00:40:26,295 --> 00:40:28,915
He is a very obscure character from the comics

676
00:40:29,016 --> 00:40:30,576
that none of them really remembered.

677
00:40:31,016 --> 00:40:33,577
So it wasn't a particularly exciting moment

678
00:40:33,637 --> 00:40:34,878
to win him from Gotcha.

679
00:40:34,898 --> 00:40:37,379
It didn't make them hyped to keep winning new characters.

680
00:40:38,039 --> 00:40:38,559
So we ditched him.

681
00:40:40,385 --> 00:40:41,606
Now players win Carl.

682
00:40:41,986 --> 00:40:44,507
He's a major character and a fan favorite.

683
00:40:45,428 --> 00:40:50,590
Even better, while Dr. Stevens is a healer, Carl is a badass attacker whose special skill

684
00:40:50,811 --> 00:40:52,331
is super strong in early battles.

685
00:40:53,172 --> 00:40:57,014
The lesson we are teaching is now much more memorable and clear.

686
00:40:57,314 --> 00:41:01,056
If you pull for new characters, you can get someone familiar who's going to be awesome.

687
00:41:02,863 --> 00:41:06,646
Another problem came from the character that players learned to level up, a guy named Jed.

688
00:41:07,246 --> 00:41:10,128
Now Jed isn't even a character in the series.

689
00:41:10,348 --> 00:41:11,029
We made him up.

690
00:41:11,629 --> 00:41:14,751
So right off the bat, not exciting for players to be using him.

691
00:41:15,312 --> 00:41:19,254
Worse, he's also pretty weak in combat, even after leveling him up.

692
00:41:20,155 --> 00:41:24,778
When players returned, they were able to remember how to level up their characters, but they

693
00:41:24,798 --> 00:41:27,860
were also now using Jed in all of their teams.

694
00:41:28,898 --> 00:41:30,579
when they had much better characters available.

695
00:41:30,859 --> 00:41:33,321
So they were taking away the very wrong conclusion

696
00:41:33,361 --> 00:41:35,503
that he was an example of a good character to use.

697
00:41:37,084 --> 00:41:40,767
We solved this by having players learn to level up Rick.

698
00:41:41,988 --> 00:41:44,069
Rick is the main character of the series,

699
00:41:44,230 --> 00:41:45,451
a big fan favorite,

700
00:41:46,131 --> 00:41:47,932
and one of the most powerful starting characters

701
00:41:47,993 --> 00:41:48,353
in the game.

702
00:41:48,933 --> 00:41:50,655
He helped us to drive home the lesson

703
00:41:50,715 --> 00:41:51,615
that we wanted to teach.

704
00:41:51,916 --> 00:41:54,538
Good characters will be made better if you invest in them.

705
00:41:56,283 --> 00:42:00,988
These changes not only helped our players to start winning those early battles in the

706
00:42:01,008 --> 00:42:05,733
game, increasing retention, but we also ended up doing a better job of teaching the value

707
00:42:05,793 --> 00:42:10,819
of characters and creating motivation to engage with Gacha, and both of those are incredibly

708
00:42:10,859 --> 00:42:13,442
important for the long-term health and revenue of the game.

709
00:42:15,540 --> 00:42:19,264
So now we've seen two examples of longitudinal research and action.

710
00:42:19,765 --> 00:42:23,709
What both of these studies really show is that optimizing the early experience of the

711
00:42:23,749 --> 00:42:25,771
game has long-term consequences.

712
00:42:26,932 --> 00:42:32,358
Teaching players what to value early on lets them know what to invest in later, and creating

713
00:42:32,438 --> 00:42:36,882
paths for players to follow encourages them to engage in the behaviors that you want to

714
00:42:36,962 --> 00:42:39,245
see and gives them a reason to keep coming back.

715
00:42:40,560 --> 00:42:45,806
These studies also show that many important issues only reveal themselves over time.

716
00:42:46,267 --> 00:42:51,433
Looking at the game as a holistic, ongoing experience was the only way to discover how

717
00:42:51,473 --> 00:42:55,018
players were really going to use and understand what we had built for them.

718
00:42:57,320 --> 00:43:01,802
Longitudinal studies are not only powerful as we've seen, but they're also a really easy

719
00:43:01,882 --> 00:43:04,024
method to add to your regular testing.

720
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:06,605
Most of the play time is unmoderated.

721
00:43:06,685 --> 00:43:08,907
Players are just off doing their own thing at home.

722
00:43:09,347 --> 00:43:12,389
So adding length to the study does not mean adding effort.

723
00:43:13,169 --> 00:43:18,732
The surveys used for the diary portion should be short to encourage completion and don't

724
00:43:18,752 --> 00:43:20,814
require a lot of time to set up or analyze.

725
00:43:21,374 --> 00:43:25,456
We tend to ask the same broad questions every day and for every game.

726
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:28,239
So surveys can even be reused between studies.

727
00:43:29,319 --> 00:43:35,344
The usability sessions and the follow-up interviews are the most time-consuming aspects since

728
00:43:35,405 --> 00:43:37,306
they require in-person moderator time.

729
00:43:37,847 --> 00:43:42,250
But when you consider that you are condensing a week or more worth of data into a couple

730
00:43:42,270 --> 00:43:46,354
of hours of moderator time per player, the time is really a bargain.

731
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:53,388
At Scopely, we now use longitudinal studies on all of our games, from Fatui's and beyond.

732
00:43:54,088 --> 00:43:58,230
I hope that sharing our studies today will help to convince you to do the same.

733
00:43:59,111 --> 00:43:59,411
Thank you.

734
00:44:01,031 --> 00:44:07,174
And I'm now honored to pass on the microphone to our last speaker, Sarah from Glue.

735
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:18,938
All right, everybody.

736
00:44:19,978 --> 00:44:22,559
Who's ready to talk about Days 100 and beyond?

737
00:44:23,739 --> 00:44:24,500
My name's Sarah.

738
00:44:24,580 --> 00:44:25,680
I work at Glue Mobile.

739
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,081
We make mobile games.

740
00:44:28,781 --> 00:44:29,402
Great news.

741
00:44:29,802 --> 00:44:31,703
A new culinary award show has just

742
00:44:31,783 --> 00:44:33,343
launched where accomplished chefs

743
00:44:33,383 --> 00:44:35,124
can earn extraordinary rewards.

744
00:44:35,984 --> 00:44:38,205
Even better news, we're going to talk all about how

745
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:40,066
we did UX research for this update.

746
00:44:41,287 --> 00:44:46,488
First I'm going to give you a little bit of a background on what Cooking Dash is and what went into the 2.0 update.

747
00:44:46,968 --> 00:44:53,470
And then I'll provide some solutions for testing unfinished features designed for experienced players that unlock late in the game.

748
00:44:53,490 --> 00:44:58,791
I'm going to show you how you can empower developers to make decisions based on facts.

749
00:45:00,792 --> 00:45:05,433
I'll provide ideas on how to keep the research fresh and timely when studying live events.

750
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,643
And finally, we'll talk about how all of these things work together so that you will see

751
00:45:10,703 --> 00:45:14,646
adoption from your teams and you'll impact on your wonderful products.

752
00:45:16,147 --> 00:45:17,488
Okay, so what's Cooking Dash?

753
00:45:18,509 --> 00:45:23,352
It's a mobile free-to-play game where you must serve food to angry customers within

754
00:45:23,392 --> 00:45:28,055
a limited amount of time while using griddles with a propensity to burn things.

755
00:45:28,896 --> 00:45:29,396
Fun, right?

756
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:32,959
Cooking Dash launched in June of 2015.

757
00:45:34,685 --> 00:45:36,206
and the update went out in November.

758
00:45:36,227 --> 00:45:38,068
And about five months before that,

759
00:45:38,708 --> 00:45:40,570
Glue User Experience Research had the honor

760
00:45:40,630 --> 00:45:42,311
to work with the talented game designers,

761
00:45:42,351 --> 00:45:44,993
producers, and product managers on this update.

762
00:45:53,539 --> 00:45:54,780
Up until the 2.0 update,

763
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,082
Cooking Dash relied heavily on new restaurants

764
00:45:58,242 --> 00:45:59,123
as a retention driver.

765
00:45:59,704 --> 00:46:00,944
The team wanted to rely less

766
00:46:01,025 --> 00:46:03,326
on this content-heavy approach.

767
00:46:04,298 --> 00:46:10,461
And instead, shift focus to a live event called Trial of Style.

768
00:46:11,521 --> 00:46:13,962
All levels in this event are procedurally generated.

769
00:46:14,422 --> 00:46:18,664
Additionally, many complex layers affect success in this live event.

770
00:46:22,706 --> 00:46:26,368
And all of these things work together to motivate players to play in new ways.

771
00:46:28,595 --> 00:46:31,317
By complex, I mean the most positive sense of the term,

772
00:46:31,917 --> 00:46:33,519
much like a delicious layer cake.

773
00:46:34,159 --> 00:46:36,881
On the bottom layer here, you see the trial of style,

774
00:46:37,602 --> 00:46:40,524
but all sorts of things work to benefit you

775
00:46:40,624 --> 00:46:43,987
to get on the leaderboards and to do well on the levels,

776
00:46:44,387 --> 00:46:46,829
such as prize wheels, outfits,

777
00:46:47,670 --> 00:46:49,951
a gauntlet set of episodes, and even pets.

778
00:46:50,632 --> 00:46:51,913
And then doing all of these things

779
00:46:51,933 --> 00:46:53,434
earns you a set of golden saucers,

780
00:46:53,534 --> 00:46:55,616
which in turn impact your ability

781
00:46:55,656 --> 00:46:57,257
to be successful in the trial of style.

782
00:46:58,669 --> 00:47:02,231
So when the team came to UX Research to talk about what they wanted to learn,

783
00:47:02,291 --> 00:47:06,373
they said, we really need to know if players understand this concept of style,

784
00:47:07,193 --> 00:47:09,054
and if they understand how to get more of it.

785
00:47:11,236 --> 00:47:12,436
We said, that sounds great.

786
00:47:12,996 --> 00:47:14,497
Those are great research questions.

787
00:47:14,817 --> 00:47:16,218
We'd love to help you figure that out.

788
00:47:16,758 --> 00:47:19,160
Because style equals success.

789
00:47:20,020 --> 00:47:23,442
And in the great leaderboard of life, those without style perish.

790
00:47:23,962 --> 00:47:26,263
Certainly users are going to understand this metaphor.

791
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:33,665
So how did we work to understand if players were getting this relationship, if they were

792
00:47:33,986 --> 00:47:35,487
themselves understanding style?

793
00:47:36,168 --> 00:47:39,791
We started first with something that we're going to call today a moderated tutorial playtest

794
00:47:39,811 --> 00:47:40,251
session.

795
00:47:40,712 --> 00:47:43,815
Then the team iterated and we moved on to some diary studies.

796
00:47:45,856 --> 00:47:47,798
The team said to us, hey, what do we do?

797
00:47:48,078 --> 00:47:49,239
There isn't a tutorial yet.

798
00:47:49,680 --> 00:47:52,162
And these features unlock really late in the game.

799
00:47:53,881 --> 00:47:55,302
We said, no problem.

800
00:47:55,942 --> 00:47:59,764
First, you need to recruit some really experienced players.

801
00:48:00,685 --> 00:48:03,427
And then you create this moderated tutorial.

802
00:48:03,907 --> 00:48:06,789
A moderated tutorial involves something like a script that

803
00:48:06,809 --> 00:48:08,870
you work hand-in-hand with the team to create.

804
00:48:11,131 --> 00:48:12,892
And we do this like a play test.

805
00:48:12,912 --> 00:48:18,236
We do this in our lab, but it contains even more, such as

806
00:48:18,656 --> 00:48:19,296
this example.

807
00:48:19,756 --> 00:48:20,977
Here we see the trial of style.

808
00:48:21,776 --> 00:48:24,718
And the moderation would be you, the researcher,

809
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:26,680
and you're basically becoming the tutorial.

810
00:48:28,121 --> 00:48:30,602
So for example, we let the play tester know

811
00:48:30,943 --> 00:48:32,564
that the trial of style has unlocked.

812
00:48:32,944 --> 00:48:34,045
It's on their home screen.

813
00:48:38,708 --> 00:48:40,409
And then we follow up with some questions.

814
00:48:40,750 --> 00:48:42,311
These questions unpack things like

815
00:48:42,391 --> 00:48:44,112
player understanding of the new features,

816
00:48:44,552 --> 00:48:45,813
relationship to the core loop,

817
00:48:46,254 --> 00:48:48,715
and we observe the ability of the player to be successful,

818
00:48:49,116 --> 00:48:51,057
and we listen to the player describe their success.

819
00:48:52,680 --> 00:48:57,624
So what did we learn? We asked the player to say, hey, did you tell me what style is?

820
00:48:59,767 --> 00:49:03,950
And here's what we found out. They didn't quite get it. So they said, oh, it's an additional

821
00:49:04,011 --> 00:49:07,394
test of your skill, but I don't really know how I got 91 super coins.

822
00:49:09,275 --> 00:49:10,216
We said, super coins?

823
00:49:10,456 --> 00:49:10,837
Oh, no.

824
00:49:11,097 --> 00:49:12,758
PIMS, Cori, what are we going to do?

825
00:49:12,778 --> 00:49:14,420
And they said, don't worry.

826
00:49:14,600 --> 00:49:16,662
We feel very validated after this study.

827
00:49:16,862 --> 00:49:18,444
And we actually have so many ideas.

828
00:49:18,484 --> 00:49:19,465
We feel so inspired.

829
00:49:19,525 --> 00:49:23,348
And I've got ways to address this already brewing in my mind.

830
00:49:25,330 --> 00:49:27,652
So after completing the moderated tutorial play test

831
00:49:27,672 --> 00:49:30,755
sessions, the team went back and iterated based on the things

832
00:49:30,795 --> 00:49:31,215
we found.

833
00:49:31,675 --> 00:49:34,198
And three months later, we conducted a diary study.

834
00:49:37,078 --> 00:49:42,241
A diary study for this particular, for this update, lasted 10 days.

835
00:49:43,061 --> 00:49:48,184
We recruited 19 participants from CookingDash and we got a mixture of spenders and non-spenders.

836
00:49:51,286 --> 00:49:55,928
Over the 10 days, participants took a survey and the daily surveys are basically the same

837
00:49:55,968 --> 00:49:56,589
thing every day.

838
00:49:57,029 --> 00:50:00,251
On the last day, they take a daily survey and they also take a wrap-up survey.

839
00:50:01,291 --> 00:50:02,812
Now daily surveys keep it vague.

840
00:50:03,883 --> 00:50:05,403
because we don't want to lead the player on.

841
00:50:05,443 --> 00:50:08,684
We want to know about what they're uncovering organically in the game.

842
00:50:08,744 --> 00:50:12,205
So we ask things like, what was your intent to play today?

843
00:50:12,945 --> 00:50:14,526
Did you encounter any frustrations?

844
00:50:15,426 --> 00:50:16,706
Did you observe anything new?

845
00:50:17,747 --> 00:50:18,547
What were your goals?

846
00:50:18,987 --> 00:50:19,767
Did you achieve them?

847
00:50:20,427 --> 00:50:23,568
And how motivated were you to play today on a scale of one to seven?

848
00:50:25,429 --> 00:50:26,769
You can plot this motivation.

849
00:50:27,864 --> 00:50:33,648
over the duration of the study and you can understand the dips, the highs and lows and

850
00:50:33,668 --> 00:50:37,650
the dips in their experience by looking at their free response questions.

851
00:50:38,891 --> 00:50:42,794
Here you can see that someone is trying to strategize in new ways.

852
00:50:43,394 --> 00:50:45,255
So they are indeed contemplating success.

853
00:50:48,397 --> 00:50:50,218
Wrap-up surveys get to specifics.

854
00:50:50,979 --> 00:50:55,181
We ask things like, can you actually define the features and you can name the features

855
00:50:55,241 --> 00:50:56,282
and ask them to explain it.

856
00:50:57,447 --> 00:51:00,570
What did you discover and when did you discover it along your journey?

857
00:51:01,490 --> 00:51:03,572
How challenging were each of these features for you?

858
00:51:04,353 --> 00:51:06,675
How satisfied were you about each of these features?

859
00:51:07,335 --> 00:51:11,498
You can show them icons or images from your game and have them describe them or describe

860
00:51:11,538 --> 00:51:13,720
the function or describe what they think they look like.

861
00:51:14,741 --> 00:51:16,242
And you can have them talk about relationships.

862
00:51:17,603 --> 00:51:22,027
A great way to ask someone to explain to you if they understand something is to actually

863
00:51:22,267 --> 00:51:22,647
have them

864
00:51:23,067 --> 00:51:27,148
Pretend like they're explaining it to their friend or to someone that isn't familiar with

865
00:51:27,188 --> 00:51:27,548
your game.

866
00:51:28,828 --> 00:51:33,030
All right, so we've talked about the 2.0, and we've provided some solutions.

867
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:36,951
But how do you help your team get to decisions based on facts?

868
00:51:38,912 --> 00:51:42,493
Creative teams benefit from observing the player engaging with their designs.

869
00:51:44,073 --> 00:51:47,213
For example, Cory and Pims actually watched the sessions.

870
00:51:47,734 --> 00:51:49,594
And here they started to realize that people were

871
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,554
really confused about the bonuses.

872
00:51:52,235 --> 00:51:55,575
And the participants were thinking that the bonuses were

873
00:51:55,615 --> 00:51:56,355
actually rewards.

874
00:51:59,656 --> 00:52:01,577
Those players were really confused about the bonuses

875
00:52:01,617 --> 00:52:03,317
that led to success in the trial of style.

876
00:52:03,397 --> 00:52:04,597
They thought they were rewards.

877
00:52:05,817 --> 00:52:07,918
How can we help players learn that all the cool stuff you

878
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,538
design, like outfits and pets, also impacts style?

879
00:52:12,912 --> 00:52:14,433
Corey says, I already know how to fix this.

880
00:52:14,473 --> 00:52:15,053
Don't worry, guys.

881
00:52:17,173 --> 00:52:19,474
What's important is to talk to your team about consequences.

882
00:52:21,074 --> 00:52:23,035
The fact is, and hey, we're trying to get to the facts,

883
00:52:23,315 --> 00:52:25,295
is that players think style is just coins,

884
00:52:25,676 --> 00:52:27,176
but we need them to know it's more than that.

885
00:52:27,676 --> 00:52:28,936
How will this misunderstanding

886
00:52:28,976 --> 00:52:30,537
impact the entire player experience?

887
00:52:31,157 --> 00:52:32,757
Well, if this is an entire meta update,

888
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:34,078
the entire system breaks down.

889
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:38,039
Another way to help your team get to the facts

890
00:52:38,159 --> 00:52:38,959
is to layer data.

891
00:52:42,531 --> 00:52:44,131
So we'll use that cake metaphor again.

892
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:46,512
You need to layer things people say

893
00:52:46,872 --> 00:52:47,813
with the things they do.

894
00:52:48,193 --> 00:52:49,813
And in this case, I'm talking about telemetry,

895
00:52:49,913 --> 00:52:51,774
stuff you're pulling from inside of the game.

896
00:52:52,854 --> 00:52:54,175
Because you're gonna be able to come

897
00:52:54,215 --> 00:52:55,615
to really strong conclusions.

898
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:57,596
And maybe you'll also make your dev team

899
00:52:57,636 --> 00:52:58,296
a little bit hungry.

900
00:53:00,057 --> 00:53:01,617
Let's take, for example, the prize wheels.

901
00:53:03,278 --> 00:53:07,099
What we learned is that 26% of the items earned

902
00:53:07,239 --> 00:53:08,680
throughout the duration of the study

903
00:53:09,140 --> 00:53:10,220
were related to outfits.

904
00:53:11,297 --> 00:53:15,619
We also learned that all of those things in red, participants didn't quite understand

905
00:53:15,659 --> 00:53:16,299
the purpose of.

906
00:53:18,401 --> 00:53:19,861
Let's take for example outfits.

907
00:53:20,282 --> 00:53:23,063
This participant says, I don't understand how to get outfits.

908
00:53:23,544 --> 00:53:24,324
Only by spinning?

909
00:53:24,724 --> 00:53:25,565
What are the benefits?

910
00:53:26,345 --> 00:53:30,467
We also saw that no one even earned an outfit saucer over the duration of the study.

911
00:53:31,787 --> 00:53:35,410
So you'd think that people might be really confused about prize wheels if half the stuff

912
00:53:35,430 --> 00:53:36,551
they're earning they don't really get.

913
00:53:36,852 --> 00:53:38,874
But it turns out they really love them.

914
00:53:39,054 --> 00:53:41,216
It was the most motivating feature in the game.

915
00:53:42,437 --> 00:53:44,500
Another thing they didn't quite understand was pets.

916
00:53:44,580 --> 00:53:47,983
And when we asked how motivating was it to get a pet, they said, well, I don't know.

917
00:53:48,003 --> 00:53:49,585
I didn't see this feature.

918
00:53:49,605 --> 00:53:50,946
I don't understand these.

919
00:53:51,447 --> 00:53:52,307
I didn't get any of this.

920
00:53:52,368 --> 00:53:53,649
So I don't know what they will do.

921
00:53:55,279 --> 00:53:59,524
So together, we could come again to the team and discuss what we found.

922
00:53:59,544 --> 00:54:04,389
And Pim said, dang, people like prize wheels, even though half the time they don't know

923
00:54:04,409 --> 00:54:06,812
what the purpose of what they are getting even is.

924
00:54:06,832 --> 00:54:09,355
So with some tweaks, we can make this feature amazing.

925
00:54:09,755 --> 00:54:11,017
And Corey said, I know what to do.

926
00:54:12,499 --> 00:54:13,660
So we've gotten to the facts.

927
00:54:14,220 --> 00:54:16,603
But how can you keep your research fresh?

928
00:54:19,245 --> 00:54:23,768
One thing you need to do is launch your diaries before the

929
00:54:23,828 --> 00:54:25,369
live event goes live.

930
00:54:26,550 --> 00:54:30,893
That way, you can gauge satisfaction before and after

931
00:54:30,913 --> 00:54:31,893
the event.

932
00:54:33,454 --> 00:54:36,296
For our study, we used a net promoter score type question,

933
00:54:36,356 --> 00:54:38,398
and we saw a 16 point increase overall.

934
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:44,462
So if you're keeping things certified fresh, are you going

935
00:54:44,482 --> 00:54:45,263
to see adoption?

936
00:54:46,303 --> 00:54:47,204
How did it go for us?

937
00:54:49,340 --> 00:54:51,541
One of the things we saw, and I talked about it earlier,

938
00:54:51,581 --> 00:54:53,341
was that people were really confusing style.

939
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:55,162
They thought it only related to the coins.

940
00:54:56,422 --> 00:54:59,983
The team iterated and made this big purple S.

941
00:55:03,424 --> 00:55:08,845
In order to decrease this association that it's only coins,

942
00:55:09,185 --> 00:55:11,506
the team reverted back to just the typical coins

943
00:55:11,546 --> 00:55:13,186
that it looks like in any episode.

944
00:55:15,187 --> 00:55:18,348
And then any boost that relates to style also became purple.

945
00:55:20,238 --> 00:55:23,681
They also fixed the issue of confusing boosts for rewards

946
00:55:24,241 --> 00:55:26,863
by removing the progress bar.

947
00:55:28,644 --> 00:55:29,525
Here's what it looks like now

948
00:55:29,605 --> 00:55:31,046
if you were to play the 2.0 update.

949
00:55:31,986 --> 00:55:32,887
And what about those pets?

950
00:55:33,687 --> 00:55:37,570
Originally, the pets only had an aesthetic effect.

951
00:55:38,951 --> 00:55:40,532
But after seeing what happened

952
00:55:40,612 --> 00:55:42,153
and seeing people's misunderstanding,

953
00:55:42,914 --> 00:55:45,736
they decided to add an actual gameplay benefit.

954
00:55:46,096 --> 00:55:48,758
So the pet now auto-surfs food as you're playing the level.

955
00:55:50,090 --> 00:55:51,051
And what about impact?

956
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:56,856
Cooking Dash has maintained steady retention for over three years.

957
00:55:58,497 --> 00:56:01,619
And hey, we even saw an increase in revenue after the 2.0 launch.

958
00:56:05,563 --> 00:56:09,466
So how do you test unfinished features designed for experienced players?

959
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:13,469
We recommend moderated tutorials and player diaries.

960
00:56:15,099 --> 00:56:18,381
You can empower your teams to make decisions based on facts

961
00:56:18,881 --> 00:56:21,862
by helping them observe and get close to your players

962
00:56:21,922 --> 00:56:24,104
engaging with the experience of their game,

963
00:56:24,444 --> 00:56:25,444
and you can layer data.

964
00:56:27,725 --> 00:56:28,846
Keep your insights fresh

965
00:56:29,126 --> 00:56:30,947
by launching before the event goes live.

966
00:56:32,728 --> 00:56:33,968
And if you do all of these things,

967
00:56:34,089 --> 00:56:37,150
I promise you will see adoption and you will be impactful.

968
00:56:38,291 --> 00:56:40,132
Thanks so much for listening to our talks today

969
00:56:40,212 --> 00:56:41,732
and thanks to all of our dev teams

970
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,893
for letting us work on their wonderful products.

971
00:56:47,746 --> 00:56:49,267
So, Seb's going to lead us through questions.

972
00:56:52,408 --> 00:56:52,768
Okay.

973
00:56:53,528 --> 00:56:56,810
So, there's a microphone in the middle of the room, I think, if anyone has any questions.

974
00:56:56,850 --> 00:56:58,750
We've got time for a couple, maybe.

975
00:57:00,951 --> 00:57:01,171
Hi.

976
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:02,312
Thanks for the talk.

977
00:57:02,952 --> 00:57:06,273
It sounds like a lot of your diary studies had very small sample sizes.

978
00:57:06,754 --> 00:57:11,616
How do you go about recruiting to make sure it kind of represents your audience, your

979
00:57:11,676 --> 00:57:12,216
users?

980
00:57:13,396 --> 00:57:15,097
So, yeah, representative sample sizes.

981
00:57:15,137 --> 00:57:15,317
Sure.

982
00:57:16,269 --> 00:57:23,154
So it depends on your project on what type of player is going to best represent what you need.

983
00:57:23,794 --> 00:57:28,477
But you always want to get some portion. So even if it's a smaller sample,

984
00:57:28,517 --> 00:57:33,280
let's say I was recruiting 12 people for my diary study, then I want

985
00:57:33,820 --> 00:57:39,363
and I need to see a mix of experienced users and new users. I'll break that in half six and six.

986
00:57:39,787 --> 00:57:41,308
Still a small sample size, right?

987
00:57:42,269 --> 00:57:45,892
Well, data that's coming in from the diary study,

988
00:57:46,893 --> 00:57:50,936
if there's a trend, trend meaning at least two or three people,

989
00:57:50,996 --> 00:57:53,938
which sounds really small, but these are unrelated people.

990
00:57:53,978 --> 00:57:55,019
They don't know each other.

991
00:57:55,479 --> 00:57:59,322
If they're talking about the same topic in the diary study,

992
00:57:59,463 --> 00:58:02,405
let's say they can't get into a certain area of the game.

993
00:58:03,165 --> 00:58:09,851
You want to balance any research method by acknowledging its weaknesses with another

994
00:58:09,931 --> 00:58:12,193
research method that is strong in that area.

995
00:58:12,493 --> 00:58:19,038
So a diary method doesn't have a large sample, so then you look at telemetry data to see

996
00:58:19,419 --> 00:58:26,264
how many people are actually getting into that area in the game, and as a designer of

997
00:58:26,344 --> 00:58:26,925
this game.

998
00:58:27,415 --> 00:58:28,275
Is that a problem?

999
00:58:28,455 --> 00:58:30,455
And how big of a problem do we think that is?

1000
00:58:31,116 --> 00:58:33,956
So you don't need a large sample size

1001
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:38,397
to address what's going on in the game.

1002
00:58:38,898 --> 00:58:40,978
You need it to understand why.

1003
00:58:40,998 --> 00:58:44,099
You only need a small sample size

1004
00:58:44,139 --> 00:58:46,519
to understand why something is happening.

1005
00:58:48,520 --> 00:58:50,260
Regrettably, I think that might be all we have time for.

1006
00:58:50,500 --> 00:58:52,481
But we're all gonna be outside in the corridor out here.

1007
00:58:53,001 --> 00:58:54,301
So do come out and ask us some questions.

1008
00:58:54,341 --> 00:58:54,862
Thanks very much.
