1
00:00:05,590 --> 00:00:06,190
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,551
So I'm Gautier Boida.

3
00:00:08,311 --> 00:00:10,352
I'm working at Square Enix in the advanced technology

4
00:00:10,372 --> 00:00:11,772
division as an AI engineer.

5
00:00:12,473 --> 00:00:14,954
And today we'll talk about verbal interaction

6
00:00:14,994 --> 00:00:16,374
with emotional character AI.

7
00:00:18,315 --> 00:00:20,196
So at first, before going further,

8
00:00:20,216 --> 00:00:23,057
I would like to say that all the content and assets

9
00:00:23,077 --> 00:00:25,958
that has been created for the demo I will show later,

10
00:00:25,978 --> 00:00:28,459
has been created only for conferences

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:29,379
and studies purposes.

12
00:00:29,420 --> 00:00:31,520
So it's not a new IP at all, not a new game,

13
00:00:31,540 --> 00:00:32,621
it's just experimental.

14
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:35,715
And this asset has been created by the people

15
00:00:35,795 --> 00:00:36,736
in the bottom row.

16
00:00:36,976 --> 00:00:39,837
So mostly technical artists and technical animators.

17
00:00:40,577 --> 00:00:42,397
And the top row, we have two AI engineers

18
00:00:43,058 --> 00:00:44,178
and two product managers.

19
00:00:44,738 --> 00:00:45,879
So thank you to all of them,

20
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,879
and also thank you to all the people

21
00:00:47,919 --> 00:00:48,839
that helped me on this project.

22
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,441
Okay, so let's move to the motivations.

23
00:00:53,141 --> 00:00:55,081
And what are we trying actually to improve here?

24
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:59,332
So when we started to experiment in virtual reality

25
00:00:59,572 --> 00:01:01,334
with non-playable characters, we were

26
00:01:01,394 --> 00:01:03,755
amazed by how we were able to feel their presence

27
00:01:03,916 --> 00:01:07,258
in this world, giving us a real feeling of being part of it.

28
00:01:08,819 --> 00:01:10,420
But we were with our own bodies, so we

29
00:01:10,460 --> 00:01:12,442
wanted to interact with them in a natural way.

30
00:01:13,102 --> 00:01:15,804
But we were limited to buttons or other classic mechanisms

31
00:01:15,824 --> 00:01:17,285
that did not apply well to VR.

32
00:01:17,885 --> 00:01:18,906
So we wanted to do more.

33
00:01:19,837 --> 00:01:22,198
And on the AI side, it was looking at us

34
00:01:22,459 --> 00:01:24,700
as if we were a ghost, just looking through us,

35
00:01:24,860 --> 00:01:27,102
not really caring about what we are doing.

36
00:01:27,743 --> 00:01:29,544
So we wanted to also improve this aspect.

37
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:32,086
So how can we do it?

38
00:01:33,027 --> 00:01:34,528
By bringing more natural interactions,

39
00:01:35,128 --> 00:01:37,210
through voice, also through body language.

40
00:01:38,031 --> 00:01:41,053
And on the AI side, by creating a more aware,

41
00:01:41,433 --> 00:01:44,816
expressive, and lively agent that can interact

42
00:01:44,836 --> 00:01:46,317
with the player appropriately,

43
00:01:46,877 --> 00:01:48,879
through actions, emotion, and reactions.

44
00:01:49,942 --> 00:01:51,863
but also to answer their own needs.

45
00:01:53,725 --> 00:01:56,707
So at first, before the whole explanation,

46
00:01:56,847 --> 00:01:58,288
I would like to show you the demonstration

47
00:01:58,589 --> 00:01:59,689
of what we have done so far.

48
00:02:01,111 --> 00:02:03,573
And we'll be able to see that the agent, Kobun,

49
00:02:04,233 --> 00:02:06,055
will express a lot of different emotions

50
00:02:06,175 --> 00:02:08,456
and reaction to what he's experiencing in the world.

51
00:02:09,217 --> 00:02:11,939
And he will also react to my voice and my speech,

52
00:02:12,119 --> 00:02:14,141
and also what I am pointing in the world.

53
00:02:14,902 --> 00:02:15,442
So let's check it.

54
00:02:17,724 --> 00:02:17,984
Hello.

55
00:02:18,344 --> 00:02:19,805
A bit loud.

56
00:02:24,446 --> 00:02:25,966
Can you plug the tank in the hole?

57
00:02:28,327 --> 00:02:30,367
So here you understood what I was talking about.

58
00:02:31,027 --> 00:02:33,108
But the canister has a lot of smoke emitting from it.

59
00:02:34,248 --> 00:02:36,209
It's quite poisonous so it's fleeing away right now.

60
00:02:36,929 --> 00:02:37,789
We have to fix that.

61
00:02:40,970 --> 00:02:42,770
Can you plug the nozzle in the white thing?

62
00:02:43,611 --> 00:02:45,831
So here I am trying to fix the white thing

63
00:02:45,871 --> 00:02:47,212
which is the canister in this case.

64
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:52,445
Great, yeah, repaired.

65
00:02:56,326 --> 00:02:58,427
Can you plug this in this hole, please?

66
00:02:59,808 --> 00:03:01,409
And here I was using my hands to point

67
00:03:01,469 --> 00:03:02,729
at the object in the world,

68
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:04,310
and the engine was able to understand.

69
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:04,931
Great.

70
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:10,793
Take the orange clip.

71
00:03:12,334 --> 00:03:14,295
Here again, with another predicate, orange,

72
00:03:14,855 --> 00:03:15,936
and it understood that it was a clip.

73
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,163
But yeah, I was a bit bad to one of my AI at the end.

74
00:03:20,283 --> 00:03:21,505
He's not very happy about it.

75
00:03:21,985 --> 00:03:23,447
But he didn't know that the electricity

76
00:03:23,487 --> 00:03:26,070
was something bad for him, but he learned about it.

77
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:27,812
And so he flew away from it.

78
00:03:29,934 --> 00:03:31,115
So what's on the menu today?

79
00:03:31,456 --> 00:03:33,578
So we'll talk about our speech recognition pipeline

80
00:03:33,899 --> 00:03:36,301
and then the decision making with the emotional components

81
00:03:36,562 --> 00:03:38,063
and some factual statement at the end.

82
00:03:39,896 --> 00:03:42,357
So let's start with speech recognition and pipeline.

83
00:03:42,957 --> 00:03:45,338
So the first block is our speech recognition engine.

84
00:03:45,358 --> 00:03:49,260
It's taking the voice and translating it

85
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:51,941
into a sentence or a list of predicated words

86
00:03:51,961 --> 00:03:52,821
with their part of speech.

87
00:03:53,661 --> 00:03:56,302
And we are sending this data to our game experience

88
00:03:56,522 --> 00:03:57,503
through the voice pipeline.

89
00:03:59,023 --> 00:04:00,544
And the first block is a grammar parser.

90
00:04:02,076 --> 00:04:04,437
And here the goal is to translate this language-based

91
00:04:04,497 --> 00:04:07,117
grammar into our ontology-based grammar.

92
00:04:07,398 --> 00:04:10,338
So you can see some new types, such as predicates and

93
00:04:10,498 --> 00:04:14,480
object, which is much more easily understood by our AI.

94
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:18,461
And then we have a word abstraction step, where the

95
00:04:18,481 --> 00:04:21,082
goal is to translate these words into a language

96
00:04:21,222 --> 00:04:22,462
independent representation.

97
00:04:23,242 --> 00:04:25,083
And here it's a colored block you can see here.

98
00:04:26,578 --> 00:04:27,999
So why do we want to do that?

99
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:30,761
Well, we want to support multiple languages

100
00:04:31,001 --> 00:04:33,122
without limiting the player set of vocabulary.

101
00:04:33,762 --> 00:04:36,284
So if later I want to add French to another language,

102
00:04:36,524 --> 00:04:39,926
I don't want to do all the bindings one by one manually.

103
00:04:40,406 --> 00:04:43,167
It's too much work, and I want a better way to do that,

104
00:04:43,187 --> 00:04:44,928
a method that is maybe automated.

105
00:04:47,150 --> 00:04:50,271
The main problem here is that worlds are language-based,

106
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:53,633
so they don't have binding one-to-one between languages.

107
00:04:54,273 --> 00:04:55,294
So we need to abstract them.

108
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:00,791
And the idea here was to create the DNA of a word,

109
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:03,732
in this case, thinking about what could be the genes.

110
00:05:05,433 --> 00:05:08,695
So if I say, take an apple, or take a break,

111
00:05:09,215 --> 00:05:11,276
these two take has different meaning.

112
00:05:12,277 --> 00:05:13,898
So you could actually have your word take

113
00:05:14,278 --> 00:05:16,679
and tag it with all the different meaning it has.

114
00:05:17,540 --> 00:05:19,141
And one meaning could be one gene,

115
00:05:19,841 --> 00:05:22,722
and then the DNA will be just a list of meanings.

116
00:05:23,983 --> 00:05:26,625
So with that idea, we decided to use WordNet.

117
00:05:27,841 --> 00:05:31,242
A database of set of creative synonyms named Synset.

118
00:05:31,782 --> 00:05:33,342
It's expressing a distinct concept.

119
00:05:34,463 --> 00:05:36,723
And it's about multiple languages, which is what we want.

120
00:05:38,484 --> 00:05:39,524
So let's take an example.

121
00:05:40,184 --> 00:05:42,404
Let's say that we want to create a concept of big

122
00:05:42,444 --> 00:05:45,225
in our experience, as in a big apple.

123
00:05:46,065 --> 00:05:46,946
So an adjective here.

124
00:05:47,926 --> 00:05:49,806
At first, we search in our database

125
00:05:50,506 --> 00:05:52,047
what are the different meaning of big.

126
00:05:52,287 --> 00:05:52,987
We have maybe 20.

127
00:05:54,767 --> 00:05:57,108
but it's too much, so which big meaning

128
00:05:57,168 --> 00:05:58,548
are we actually interested in?

129
00:05:59,688 --> 00:06:02,069
So we said an adjective, so let's remove the adverbs.

130
00:06:03,809 --> 00:06:06,050
And then we're going to take all the meaning one by one

131
00:06:06,370 --> 00:06:07,950
and select the one that we're interested in.

132
00:06:08,850 --> 00:06:12,271
In this case, we're interested in above average in size

133
00:06:12,371 --> 00:06:16,572
or number or quantity or extent, and also significant.

134
00:06:17,672 --> 00:06:20,493
And these two meanings will make our DNA

135
00:06:20,573 --> 00:06:22,433
for the concept of big we wanted to create.

136
00:06:24,808 --> 00:06:27,268
If we have some doubt about one of this meaning,

137
00:06:27,508 --> 00:06:30,009
we can check the WordNet database in detail

138
00:06:30,229 --> 00:06:33,770
and understand which words they are actually bound to

139
00:06:34,530 --> 00:06:36,171
in the different languages it supports.

140
00:06:37,171 --> 00:06:40,031
And we also have sentences examples at the bottom.

141
00:06:41,532 --> 00:06:42,852
So it's very easy to understand

142
00:06:43,032 --> 00:06:44,653
if this meaning is the one you want.

143
00:06:47,493 --> 00:06:47,693
Okay.

144
00:06:48,905 --> 00:06:52,548
So now our statement is totally language independent,

145
00:06:53,148 --> 00:06:55,710
and we are supporting multiple languages thanks to WordNet.

146
00:06:57,131 --> 00:07:01,714
And also, now that I'm on the previous one, yes, this one.

147
00:07:02,794 --> 00:07:04,996
So now, the goal will be to try to understand

148
00:07:05,056 --> 00:07:08,378
this abstracted world into the concept

149
00:07:08,418 --> 00:07:10,500
that we're actually supporting in our game world.

150
00:07:12,187 --> 00:07:16,368
For instance, pickup and enormous are not part of our game,

151
00:07:16,789 --> 00:07:18,690
but we have take and we have big as well.

152
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,311
And because they are close to pickup and enormous,

153
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:24,672
our grounding step will be able to translate them

154
00:07:24,812 --> 00:07:25,733
into take and big.

155
00:07:32,076 --> 00:07:34,537
So here we are going to use a UTT-based scoring method.

156
00:07:35,817 --> 00:07:36,898
So here is a simple one.

157
00:07:37,398 --> 00:07:39,299
We have the word enormous with its DNA.

158
00:07:40,658 --> 00:07:43,420
And we have a list of predicates that we are supporting in our game world.

159
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:46,722
So big, small, red, with their own DNA.

160
00:07:47,682 --> 00:07:49,384
And we are just going to compare their DNA

161
00:07:49,844 --> 00:07:53,026
and check which DNA is the closest to the DNA of Enormous.

162
00:07:54,127 --> 00:07:56,248
In this case, big is going to be the closest,

163
00:07:56,868 --> 00:07:58,589
so Enormous is going to become big.

164
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:03,012
So now, if I say, for instance, take a giant apple,

165
00:08:03,513 --> 00:08:05,594
giant will also be translated into big.

166
00:08:06,655 --> 00:08:10,257
So we are actually now extending the player set of vocabulary.

167
00:08:11,387 --> 00:08:13,350
And we are also supporting multiple languages.

168
00:08:14,372 --> 00:08:16,615
So now we don't even know, actually, how many words

169
00:08:16,635 --> 00:08:17,496
we are supporting now.

170
00:08:20,533 --> 00:08:23,374
However, here we are still outside of our AI.

171
00:08:23,614 --> 00:08:25,075
We are just in our voice pipeline.

172
00:08:25,995 --> 00:08:27,756
So we cannot ground everything.

173
00:08:28,576 --> 00:08:31,757
Objects particularly relies on the knowledge of each agent.

174
00:08:32,197 --> 00:08:33,457
For instance, on the left,

175
00:08:34,037 --> 00:08:37,378
agent A known about a bowl, a banana, and a table.

176
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:39,559
So if I say, take a fridge,

177
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:42,400
it will try to understand the DNA of fridge

178
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:45,741
against a bowl, or a banana, or a table.

179
00:08:45,981 --> 00:08:47,581
It doesn't know yet what is a fridge.

180
00:08:49,032 --> 00:08:50,313
So we'll do it later.

181
00:08:50,333 --> 00:08:54,955
Okay, so now our statement is ready.

182
00:08:55,095 --> 00:08:56,796
So we just store it in our statement memory

183
00:08:57,016 --> 00:08:58,157
and we can move to the next step,

184
00:08:59,998 --> 00:09:01,118
which is the decision making.

185
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:04,760
So our decision making system is very simple.

186
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,461
We have a goal manager and a planner.

187
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,442
And the goal manager is UTT based.

188
00:09:10,623 --> 00:09:11,803
So we have a list of goals

189
00:09:12,464 --> 00:09:14,305
and we are going to compute a score for each of them.

190
00:09:14,985 --> 00:09:16,866
And we are going to execute the highest scored one.

191
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:19,590
In this case, going to be listen to player.

192
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:22,051
And the plan that we are going to have is listen,

193
00:09:22,752 --> 00:09:24,613
which will just copy the statement

194
00:09:24,833 --> 00:09:27,355
from the statement memory into the AI memory.

195
00:09:28,756 --> 00:09:30,177
And then the agent can decide

196
00:09:30,237 --> 00:09:32,779
if he want to execute or not this order.

197
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:35,200
In this case, he does want to.

198
00:09:36,321 --> 00:09:37,462
So we are going to have a plan

199
00:09:37,502 --> 00:09:39,523
that will be look for this object

200
00:09:39,824 --> 00:09:41,885
and then go near this item and take it.

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:46,041
And that's where we're actually going to do

202
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:47,663
our grounding for the object.

203
00:09:48,403 --> 00:09:50,545
So the look for action, we try to understand

204
00:09:51,145 --> 00:09:55,128
to which object it is the closest to inside the AI memory.

205
00:09:56,249 --> 00:09:58,811
And to do so, we are going to use again a utility-based

206
00:09:58,891 --> 00:10:02,093
system, it's going to be the NPMT-AXIS utility system.

207
00:10:03,675 --> 00:10:05,336
So what I didn't say earlier is that

208
00:10:05,656 --> 00:10:07,137
goals can actually have targets.

209
00:10:07,477 --> 00:10:10,900
So you can have multiple goals with different targets

210
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,921
and compute a score for each of them.

211
00:10:14,102 --> 00:10:16,163
And that's what we are going to do for the look for action.

212
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:19,524
We are going to have one goal, find suitable objects,

213
00:10:20,845 --> 00:10:21,925
and plenty of targets.

214
00:10:22,445 --> 00:10:25,747
And these targets are going to be the items that my AI knows.

215
00:10:27,007 --> 00:10:28,708
And we're going to compute a score for each of them.

216
00:10:31,129 --> 00:10:35,250
So now we are going to try to understand how close or similar

217
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:37,931
is this target against the object

218
00:10:37,951 --> 00:10:41,413
that we have in our statement, which was our enormous apple.

219
00:10:43,242 --> 00:10:44,984
So it will depend on different axis.

220
00:10:45,364 --> 00:10:46,746
The first one is object type.

221
00:10:47,066 --> 00:10:49,449
So we are going to compare how close the type of target

222
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:50,850
and this object DNA is.

223
00:10:52,171 --> 00:10:54,554
And then the size and a lot of different axis,

224
00:10:54,594 --> 00:10:57,197
such as color, location, closeness, and confidence.

225
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:01,181
We are going to have a weight, a score for each of them,

226
00:11:01,281 --> 00:11:03,543
and combining the score, and we get the score for target.

227
00:11:06,206 --> 00:11:08,448
So let's move into our object type axis

228
00:11:08,528 --> 00:11:11,630
and understand how we can compare the type of this apple,

229
00:11:11,670 --> 00:11:14,172
for instance, against our object DNA.

230
00:11:15,092 --> 00:11:18,375
What we can do is just compute the DNA of apple

231
00:11:18,695 --> 00:11:20,296
and compare both DNA together.

232
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:22,818
In this case, we have the same DNA,

233
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:24,319
so we are going to have a score of one.

234
00:11:25,320 --> 00:11:28,042
And for benign tables, the DNA is totally different,

235
00:11:28,222 --> 00:11:29,203
so the score will be zero.

236
00:11:30,495 --> 00:11:35,960
I don't know if you see it now, but we're looking for an enormous apple, which is an edible fruit.

237
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:41,064
Nevertheless, the score of banana and table are the same, really far away.

238
00:11:41,644 --> 00:11:44,647
But banana is a fruit as well, an edible fruit.

239
00:11:45,507 --> 00:11:50,411
So it would be better to have a better score than zero, but maybe not one, because it's a UTT system.

240
00:11:51,772 --> 00:11:53,614
So we have actually a better way to do so.

241
00:11:54,595 --> 00:11:58,478
WordNet organizes all these things or meanings into a hierarchy.

242
00:12:00,027 --> 00:12:02,989
And our object apple is actually going to be located

243
00:12:03,049 --> 00:12:05,251
right there, below edible fruit.

244
00:12:06,753 --> 00:12:09,455
Which is also the case of banana, but not table,

245
00:12:09,635 --> 00:12:11,577
which is located quite high in the hierarchy.

246
00:12:12,518 --> 00:12:14,740
So we can see how we can get a better score here.

247
00:12:17,242 --> 00:12:20,245
So at first we are going to check where our object DNA

248
00:12:20,345 --> 00:12:23,448
is located inside this hierarchy, and set the node to one,

249
00:12:24,028 --> 00:12:25,609
and just interpolate into the root.

250
00:12:27,806 --> 00:12:30,268
And all the nodes below, because they are also apples,

251
00:12:30,328 --> 00:12:31,329
are going to be set to 1.

252
00:12:33,130 --> 00:12:36,092
And now we can compute a score for all the different objects

253
00:12:36,132 --> 00:12:36,493
we have.

254
00:12:37,654 --> 00:12:40,316
So apple is going to be 1, but banana is going to be,

255
00:12:40,376 --> 00:12:40,736
this time, 0.86.

256
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:41,517
And table is going to be 0.14.

257
00:12:46,018 --> 00:12:47,379
So now we have a better score.

258
00:12:47,880 --> 00:12:51,122
And for instance, if in my game there is no apple,

259
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,443
and I say pick up an enormous apple,

260
00:12:54,224 --> 00:12:57,086
maybe the agent will actually take a banana instead.

261
00:12:57,246 --> 00:12:59,127
But it's still close enough and acceptable.

262
00:12:59,548 --> 00:13:00,868
It's better than a table, right?

263
00:13:04,871 --> 00:13:07,413
Okay, so let's take an example this time

264
00:13:07,553 --> 00:13:10,435
with our apple A, and try to score it.

265
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,856
So the type is the same,

266
00:13:12,917 --> 00:13:14,277
so we are going to have a score of one.

267
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:18,097
And then for the size, we are going to check our AI memory.

268
00:13:18,597 --> 00:13:21,760
How big is this apple against the thing I know?

269
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:25,223
It's average in size, so we are going to have a score of 0.5.

270
00:13:26,124 --> 00:13:27,725
And we do the same for the other axis,

271
00:13:27,905 --> 00:13:30,788
and we get a score of 0.91 for apple A.

272
00:13:32,469 --> 00:13:34,351
We do this for all the different items,

273
00:13:34,671 --> 00:13:38,174
and the winner in this case is apple B, our biggest

274
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,996
apple inside the memory, which is what we wanted.

275
00:13:43,676 --> 00:13:45,577
Okay, so the look for action has found

276
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:49,459
that the closest item inside the AI memory is Applebee.

277
00:13:49,959 --> 00:13:52,701
So now we are just going nearby this item and take it.

278
00:13:53,461 --> 00:13:58,684
And that's what I am going to show you inside this video,

279
00:13:59,344 --> 00:14:00,525
but with different objects.

280
00:14:00,885 --> 00:14:02,146
It's going to be an orange clip.

281
00:14:03,026 --> 00:14:05,928
And because from now on, we are going to talk about emotions,

282
00:14:06,488 --> 00:14:08,209
you will also see some new things,

283
00:14:08,249 --> 00:14:11,050
such as emotional reactions with liking,

284
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,111
disliking behaviors.

285
00:14:14,534 --> 00:14:15,374
Take the orange clip.

286
00:14:21,175 --> 00:14:22,896
Sorry.

287
00:14:22,976 --> 00:14:24,216
Please, take it.

288
00:14:24,236 --> 00:14:28,137
You don't want to take it, right?

289
00:14:28,157 --> 00:14:30,197
I will remove electricity then.

290
00:14:32,978 --> 00:14:36,039
And now, can you take the orange clip?

291
00:14:39,159 --> 00:14:39,459
Great.

292
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,040
You are willing to take it this time.

293
00:14:42,422 --> 00:14:44,503
Can you plug it to the red pole, please?

294
00:14:50,624 --> 00:14:50,905
Cool.

295
00:14:53,445 --> 00:14:56,566
So the goal of this experience was to fix the rocket,

296
00:14:56,826 --> 00:14:58,827
and by plugging the cable to the red pole,

297
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:00,147
we fixed half of it.

298
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,148
That's why the agent was happy at the end.

299
00:15:02,788 --> 00:15:04,788
But earlier, he has been shocked by the cable,

300
00:15:04,808 --> 00:15:06,429
so he was not really liking it at all.

301
00:15:06,769 --> 00:15:08,970
But at the end, he was maybe starting to like it.

302
00:15:10,005 --> 00:15:12,266
So I will explain this in the next part.

303
00:15:12,426 --> 00:15:15,487
But before, let me introduce our emotional components.

304
00:15:16,628 --> 00:15:18,369
So it's composed of three different modules.

305
00:15:18,729 --> 00:15:21,970
The first one is emotion, so a very short-term feeling

306
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:24,631
that evolves quickly over time, such as joy, distress,

307
00:15:24,671 --> 00:15:25,011
and fear.

308
00:15:27,072 --> 00:15:28,633
And we have also a mood module, which

309
00:15:28,733 --> 00:15:31,534
is a much more long-term feeling that

310
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:36,216
evolves slowly and smoothly over time, like exuberant, depressed,

311
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:36,756
and afraid.

312
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,921
and they are going to influence each other.

313
00:15:42,322 --> 00:15:43,483
And on top of these two module,

314
00:15:43,523 --> 00:15:48,085
we have a personality module that will define the agent.

315
00:15:49,305 --> 00:15:51,246
That has no real evolution over time,

316
00:15:51,546 --> 00:15:54,527
and it's things such as curiosity, shyness, and laziness.

317
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:58,708
So let's go in our emotion module at first.

318
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,870
So this is an inspired OCC model.

319
00:16:02,110 --> 00:16:03,210
It's not the original one,

320
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,411
but it may still look a bit complex.

321
00:16:06,011 --> 00:16:06,791
So I will explain it.

322
00:16:08,018 --> 00:16:11,342
So it's taking as a top a valence reaction or an event,

323
00:16:12,303 --> 00:16:14,885
and we just assess from our AI point of view

324
00:16:15,146 --> 00:16:17,568
if it's a positive thing or a negative thing.

325
00:16:18,949 --> 00:16:20,671
And then, depending on the type of event,

326
00:16:21,011 --> 00:16:22,373
like an aspect of object,

327
00:16:23,073 --> 00:16:24,995
if I saw something in the world, for instance,

328
00:16:25,876 --> 00:16:27,197
I may like it or dislike it.

329
00:16:27,718 --> 00:16:30,561
Therefore, I will generate a love or hate emotion.

330
00:16:32,345 --> 00:16:35,145
If this event is a consequence of something

331
00:16:35,186 --> 00:16:38,046
that happened in the world, or a consequence of an action,

332
00:16:38,786 --> 00:16:40,287
we may express joy or distress.

333
00:16:41,967 --> 00:16:43,968
And if this event is an action of an agent,

334
00:16:44,188 --> 00:16:48,129
if it's my own actions, I'm going to express pride or shame,

335
00:16:49,249 --> 00:16:51,350
and if it's the action of the player, for instance,

336
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:54,651
I may express admiration or reproach towards the player.

337
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,924
And also, if there is a related consequence to these actions,

338
00:17:00,344 --> 00:17:02,665
if it's a related consequence to my own actions,

339
00:17:02,825 --> 00:17:05,546
I'm going to express them to be gratification or remorse.

340
00:17:06,386 --> 00:17:07,807
And if it's a related consequence

341
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,488
to the action of the player, I may express gratitude

342
00:17:10,628 --> 00:17:11,708
or anger toward him.

343
00:17:13,783 --> 00:17:17,045
So that's the model, it may even still be complex.

344
00:17:17,325 --> 00:17:18,425
So let's take an example.

345
00:17:18,885 --> 00:17:21,946
So earlier in this video, the agent has been shocked

346
00:17:21,986 --> 00:17:25,387
by the cable, and this cable was activated by the player.

347
00:17:25,807 --> 00:17:27,088
Yes, press the button, right?

348
00:17:28,628 --> 00:17:32,069
So this event is negative for our agent, I think, right?

349
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:36,831
It was a consequence of the event,

350
00:17:37,471 --> 00:17:40,092
of the action of the player, activation of the button.

351
00:17:41,621 --> 00:17:43,862
So we are going to express our distressed emotion.

352
00:17:43,902 --> 00:17:45,603
We are not really happy that we have been shocked

353
00:17:45,623 --> 00:17:46,203
by the cable.

354
00:17:47,503 --> 00:17:50,484
But we are also going to express anger towards the player

355
00:17:50,625 --> 00:17:52,685
because it's his fault that I have been shocked

356
00:17:53,045 --> 00:17:53,686
by this cable.

357
00:17:54,786 --> 00:17:57,207
And that's how we are going to generate our emotions.

358
00:17:59,328 --> 00:18:03,130
So now, how can we like or dislike the thing in the walls?

359
00:18:04,450 --> 00:18:08,512
Well, earlier, when the agent has been shocked by the cable,

360
00:18:08,772 --> 00:18:10,753
we have generated our distressed emotions.

361
00:18:11,587 --> 00:18:13,669
But you can do one more thing at this step.

362
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:18,755
We can also add a negative effect to the cable object,

363
00:18:18,995 --> 00:18:21,197
but also to the electrified predicate.

364
00:18:22,299 --> 00:18:24,441
And an effect will just be an intensity

365
00:18:24,781 --> 00:18:28,065
with a memorable duration, so that it can forget over time.

366
00:18:29,927 --> 00:18:32,089
And now, thanks to this effect.

367
00:18:32,987 --> 00:18:35,348
The agent will not like anything that is a cable

368
00:18:35,549 --> 00:18:37,109
or anything that is electrified.

369
00:18:37,570 --> 00:18:40,111
So if there is another electrified something over there,

370
00:18:40,311 --> 00:18:41,451
it will not get close to it.

371
00:18:43,953 --> 00:18:44,393
So great.

372
00:18:45,173 --> 00:18:47,535
The agent does not like the electrified cable anymore.

373
00:18:48,075 --> 00:18:49,776
So what if we tell him to take it again?

374
00:18:51,677 --> 00:18:53,017
Well, the plan is still the same.

375
00:18:53,457 --> 00:18:55,118
We're still going to look for our cable.

376
00:18:56,279 --> 00:18:57,900
We are going to find it, and then we

377
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:59,900
are going to try to go nearby this cable.

378
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:02,461
But because he's hating it, he will refuse,

379
00:19:02,881 --> 00:19:04,102
and the plan will be canceled.

380
00:19:06,583 --> 00:19:08,243
OK, next, the mood.

381
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:14,106
So it is based on the PAD model, so pleasure, arousal, dominance.

382
00:19:15,126 --> 00:19:17,907
And the P means how pleasant is an emotion.

383
00:19:18,947 --> 00:19:21,588
A is about how intense is an emotion.

384
00:19:22,597 --> 00:19:26,778
And D, a bit more complex, it's about how much control

385
00:19:26,978 --> 00:19:29,739
and influence the agent has over situations.

386
00:19:31,919 --> 00:19:34,700
And inside this cube, we'll have all of our emotions.

387
00:19:36,461 --> 00:19:39,181
And this cube can be separated into eight octants.

388
00:19:39,682 --> 00:19:41,342
For instance, here we have the mood afraid.

389
00:19:42,743 --> 00:19:44,763
And at the top right, where joy is,

390
00:19:44,843 --> 00:19:46,304
it's going to be the mood exuberant.

391
00:19:46,704 --> 00:19:47,704
So we have eight of them.

392
00:19:49,573 --> 00:19:52,655
And inside this cube, we have our default mood,

393
00:19:52,975 --> 00:19:54,336
which is currently at the position 0, 0, 0.

394
00:19:56,717 --> 00:20:00,019
And this mood is going to move smoothly over time,

395
00:20:00,139 --> 00:20:02,820
depending on what emotions are going to be generated.

396
00:20:05,141 --> 00:20:06,562
So let's see the update now.

397
00:20:07,222 --> 00:20:08,783
So let's say we have a joy emotion

398
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:11,244
with a certain intensity for five seconds.

399
00:20:12,285 --> 00:20:14,266
Depending on the intensity, the speed

400
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,007
at which the dot will move towards the joy emotion

401
00:20:17,467 --> 00:20:18,148
will be different.

402
00:20:19,327 --> 00:20:20,808
And when the emotion has been expressed,

403
00:20:21,008 --> 00:20:22,890
there is no emotional activity anymore.

404
00:20:23,450 --> 00:20:26,632
So we will slowly go back to our default mood.

405
00:20:28,633 --> 00:20:32,076
In a more complex example, it can be something like that.

406
00:20:34,297 --> 00:20:35,698
So here we are exuberant,

407
00:20:35,978 --> 00:20:37,959
and even more exuberant right now.

408
00:20:37,999 --> 00:20:40,841
We can see that he's very smiley now.

409
00:20:42,742 --> 00:20:44,223
And now a bit of eight,

410
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:46,865
so we are just in the hostile mood just at the beginning,

411
00:20:47,065 --> 00:20:48,806
and we can see a sort of vicious smile.

412
00:20:49,604 --> 00:20:51,225
Now he's quite not happy at all.

413
00:20:52,285 --> 00:20:56,147
And now due to the same emotion, he's very sad, a bit afraid.

414
00:20:59,569 --> 00:21:01,369
And now a very strong hate emotion,

415
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:02,910
and we can see that he's very not happy.

416
00:21:04,771 --> 00:21:07,012
So thanks to this PID model, now we

417
00:21:07,032 --> 00:21:09,053
are able to blend our different animation

418
00:21:09,113 --> 00:21:11,814
for the different moods and get some new things,

419
00:21:11,854 --> 00:21:14,455
such as the vicious smile.

420
00:21:16,116 --> 00:21:17,316
So it's a very powerful tool.

421
00:21:20,158 --> 00:21:22,099
And lastly, we have our personality module,

422
00:21:22,539 --> 00:21:23,819
which is the simplest one.

423
00:21:24,579 --> 00:21:27,280
It's just UTT parameters, such as laziness,

424
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:29,221
curiosity, honesty, obedience.

425
00:21:31,061 --> 00:21:32,841
And I want to introduce at first

426
00:21:33,442 --> 00:21:34,962
how we have done the laziness one.

427
00:21:35,942 --> 00:21:38,843
So in this video, at first, yes, laziness is 10%,

428
00:21:39,243 --> 00:21:40,343
so not very lazy.

429
00:21:41,323 --> 00:21:41,904
So let's check.

430
00:21:42,204 --> 00:21:43,664
Take the purple clip, please.

431
00:21:47,074 --> 00:21:49,036
So here, yes, he's just going to take the purple clip.

432
00:21:49,236 --> 00:21:49,976
Nothing special.

433
00:21:49,996 --> 00:21:56,281
Take the purple clip, please.

434
00:21:57,882 --> 00:21:58,943
But now he's very lazy.

435
00:21:59,223 --> 00:22:01,205
He does not care anymore about the color

436
00:22:01,225 --> 00:22:01,945
or any other thing.

437
00:22:02,105 --> 00:22:04,227
He just want to take the clip, the closest one,

438
00:22:05,128 --> 00:22:05,988
because he's very lazy.

439
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:09,351
So how did we do that?

440
00:22:10,493 --> 00:22:12,775
So personality laziness parameter

441
00:22:12,995 --> 00:22:15,277
is going to affect our look for action.

442
00:22:15,577 --> 00:22:18,579
We'll favor closer object over farther object.

443
00:22:20,741 --> 00:22:22,022
If you remember earlier,

444
00:22:22,042 --> 00:22:26,025
I introduced our find suitable object action

445
00:22:26,085 --> 00:22:28,146
with a certain axis named closeness.

446
00:22:28,746 --> 00:22:31,769
And you can see that the weight is 0.1, so very small.

447
00:22:32,549 --> 00:22:34,130
So maybe why is it small?

448
00:22:34,210 --> 00:22:35,351
Maybe that's the first question.

449
00:22:36,248 --> 00:22:39,530
Well, we just wanted, just in case we have two items

450
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:42,931
with the same score, we wanted to favorite the item

451
00:22:42,971 --> 00:22:46,173
that is a bit closer to the agent, but just a little bit.

452
00:22:47,214 --> 00:22:50,615
But in this case, the lazier the agent is,

453
00:22:51,016 --> 00:22:53,537
the more important the closeness axis should be.

454
00:22:54,257 --> 00:22:56,158
So instead of having a static weight,

455
00:22:56,859 --> 00:22:58,600
we are going to have actually a way

456
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:00,921
that will depend on this laziness axis.

457
00:23:01,701 --> 00:23:03,242
And we can add a range if we want.

458
00:23:04,719 --> 00:23:08,040
And thanks to this, we are now able to express our laziness

459
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,541
personality parameter.

460
00:23:13,342 --> 00:23:15,742
In general, the personality parameters

461
00:23:15,762 --> 00:23:18,303
can affect a lot of different things in the decision making.

462
00:23:18,563 --> 00:23:20,644
They can affect your goal manager, goal score,

463
00:23:20,804 --> 00:23:23,045
or the set of actions you will use for the planner.

464
00:23:23,585 --> 00:23:26,506
They can affect also the tolerance on liking, disliking,

465
00:23:27,426 --> 00:23:30,407
or the way the emotions are going to be expressed.

466
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:31,727
For instance, with shyness.

467
00:23:33,130 --> 00:23:35,913
So it's a very powerful tool, despite being very simple.

468
00:23:36,653 --> 00:23:38,755
And it allows for a great variation of place.

469
00:23:39,195 --> 00:23:40,676
And if we have multiple NPCs,

470
00:23:40,716 --> 00:23:42,878
they will all feel a bit different to each other.

471
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,642
Okay, so lastly I would like to talk about

472
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:51,265
a factual statement, which is about

473
00:23:51,405 --> 00:23:53,266
informing the agent about the world.

474
00:23:55,888 --> 00:23:57,770
Maybe there is a nozzle in front of the rocket.

475
00:24:00,412 --> 00:24:01,193
Can you take the nozzle?

476
00:24:05,024 --> 00:24:07,425
So here he's looking around in front of the rocket.

477
00:24:10,027 --> 00:24:11,548
And he found the nozzle, very happy.

478
00:24:15,210 --> 00:24:17,131
Maybe there is another in front of the rocket.

479
00:24:20,313 --> 00:24:21,213
Can you take the nozzle?

480
00:24:22,254 --> 00:24:23,975
So obviously here there is no nozzle,

481
00:24:24,275 --> 00:24:26,756
but he's still going to look for it in front of the rocket.

482
00:24:28,978 --> 00:24:29,758
But yeah, this time.

483
00:24:30,555 --> 00:24:31,555
There is no nozzle, right?

484
00:24:31,755 --> 00:24:33,857
There is no nozzle, so he's not really happy about it.

485
00:24:34,137 --> 00:24:35,998
We lied to him, so he's not very happy.

486
00:24:37,879 --> 00:24:38,960
So how did we do that?

487
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,402
Well, at first, the player is just going to say a statement,

488
00:24:42,722 --> 00:24:44,963
such as, there is an apple on the table.

489
00:24:45,984 --> 00:24:47,725
So we are going to listen to the statement,

490
00:24:48,085 --> 00:24:51,127
and we are going to create a factual apple in our memory.

491
00:24:51,427 --> 00:24:53,388
We don't know yet if it's actually existing.

492
00:24:55,089 --> 00:24:57,951
And then the player is asking the agent to take an apple.

493
00:24:59,432 --> 00:25:02,154
So we'll look for action, we find that the best object

494
00:25:02,374 --> 00:25:04,695
is this factual object, this factual apple.

495
00:25:05,715 --> 00:25:08,377
But we don't know yet if it's actually existing in the world

496
00:25:08,557 --> 00:25:10,438
so we are going to try to ground it.

497
00:25:14,840 --> 00:25:16,121
So another goal we'll take over

498
00:25:16,741 --> 00:25:18,282
is going to be the ground fact goal

499
00:25:18,662 --> 00:25:20,323
and the goal will be to go on the table

500
00:25:20,603 --> 00:25:21,563
and just look around.

501
00:25:22,124 --> 00:25:23,304
In this case there is an apple

502
00:25:23,444 --> 00:25:25,685
so we're just going to replace our factual apple

503
00:25:26,045 --> 00:25:26,706
with this apple.

504
00:25:28,204 --> 00:25:30,106
So when the takeApple action will take over,

505
00:25:30,586 --> 00:25:31,787
we'll find the correct apple

506
00:25:31,867 --> 00:25:33,449
and the agent will be happy about it.

507
00:25:40,094 --> 00:25:42,076
So what if there is no apple on the table?

508
00:25:42,477 --> 00:25:45,619
Well, the ground fact action still, goal still happen.

509
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,222
We're still going to go on the table,

510
00:25:48,522 --> 00:25:49,983
but we're going to find no apple.

511
00:25:50,003 --> 00:25:51,685
So we just remove the factual object.

512
00:25:52,585 --> 00:25:54,847
And then, when the lookFor action restarts,

513
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:59,115
We find just nothing, so the agent is not pleased about that,

514
00:25:59,536 --> 00:26:00,736
so he's quite angry about it.

515
00:26:01,557 --> 00:26:02,257
We lied to him.

516
00:26:05,699 --> 00:26:07,580
So, what did we achieve so far?

517
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,442
I think we brought more natural interactions,

518
00:26:11,222 --> 00:26:13,503
so at first the speech recognition pipeline,

519
00:26:13,984 --> 00:26:16,905
but also we created a more aware and expressive

520
00:26:17,526 --> 00:26:20,867
and lively agent, thanks to different emotional reactions,

521
00:26:21,148 --> 00:26:22,508
the moods, but also the emotion.

522
00:26:24,145 --> 00:26:26,826
And this agent has upgrade variations

523
00:26:27,066 --> 00:26:28,466
thanks to the personality module.

524
00:26:30,307 --> 00:26:33,047
And this agent are also environment aware.

525
00:26:33,247 --> 00:26:36,128
They can like, dislike, and react appropriately

526
00:26:36,628 --> 00:26:37,369
with this knowledge.

527
00:26:37,849 --> 00:26:40,049
They can, for instance, refuse to do an action

528
00:26:40,069 --> 00:26:42,450
that is involving an object that they are hating.

529
00:26:43,851 --> 00:26:46,531
And the NPCs can also react to truth and lies

530
00:26:46,671 --> 00:26:47,772
regarding the environment.

531
00:26:50,132 --> 00:26:51,233
And what can we do from here?

532
00:26:52,309 --> 00:26:54,731
Well, the cool thing would be to develop a relationship

533
00:26:54,771 --> 00:26:56,552
between the player and the agent.

534
00:26:56,732 --> 00:26:58,633
For instance, if the player is polite,

535
00:26:58,813 --> 00:27:00,975
maybe it's going to be OK.

536
00:27:01,035 --> 00:27:03,116
But if we're angry towards the agent,

537
00:27:03,176 --> 00:27:06,779
maybe he should flee away or be scared, this kind of thing.

538
00:27:08,722 --> 00:27:11,924
You could also have multiple agents, especially in VR.

539
00:27:12,204 --> 00:27:14,446
It's a big world, but we are just alone

540
00:27:14,486 --> 00:27:15,566
with this little creature.

541
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:18,948
It would be even better with a lot of different agents

542
00:27:18,968 --> 00:27:21,470
that interact with each other through emotions,

543
00:27:21,510 --> 00:27:22,410
but also with the player.

544
00:27:24,872 --> 00:27:28,234
And also, this is from play testing.

545
00:27:29,049 --> 00:27:30,610
We are working with speech recognition,

546
00:27:30,650 --> 00:27:33,531
so it's important to have a lot of diverse feedback

547
00:27:33,671 --> 00:27:34,772
from our AI agents.

548
00:27:35,632 --> 00:27:37,973
The most easiest one is certainly,

549
00:27:37,993 --> 00:27:39,854
I did not understand your speech.

550
00:27:40,314 --> 00:27:43,536
But something such as, OK, I understood,

551
00:27:43,656 --> 00:27:46,437
but I don't have the ability to execute your order.

552
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,118
This is some kind of feedback that you

553
00:27:48,158 --> 00:27:50,859
need to actually create so that the user understands

554
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:51,500
what's happening.

555
00:27:53,663 --> 00:27:55,205
So I think that's it today for me.

556
00:27:55,725 --> 00:27:58,227
And we have two minutes for questions.

557
00:27:58,767 --> 00:27:59,788
Three, two, three?

558
00:28:13,697 --> 00:28:14,498
Yes.

559
00:28:15,078 --> 00:28:17,780
In one of the videos, the little character,

560
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,742
it, when you told it to go,

561
00:28:21,750 --> 00:28:24,592
get something, it turned and knew exactly what you were talking about.

562
00:28:25,072 --> 00:28:25,313
Yes.

563
00:28:25,973 --> 00:28:29,957
But then when you lied to it, it also turned and knew exactly where to go.

564
00:28:30,597 --> 00:28:36,842
So what's confusing, it seems that it knows that there are things that are there in the

565
00:28:36,882 --> 00:28:41,666
first case, but when you lied to it, why wouldn't it know that there is not an apple there?

566
00:28:42,367 --> 00:28:43,428
And I know that's a double negative.

567
00:28:43,448 --> 00:28:46,210
I think I did not understand the first example.

568
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:49,132
So when you first spoke to the creature, it knew.

569
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,564
It behaved as if it knew everything that was around it.

570
00:28:54,584 --> 00:28:58,830
But when you lied to it, it behaved as if it was surprised that you didn't know.

571
00:28:58,890 --> 00:29:00,192
That seems contradictory.

572
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:05,313
So you're speaking about the factual statement where

573
00:29:05,513 --> 00:29:07,794
at first I am teaching the AI, like for instance,

574
00:29:07,814 --> 00:29:09,595
there is an apple in front of the rocket.

575
00:29:10,275 --> 00:29:13,637
And then the agent actually checks and there is nothing,

576
00:29:13,677 --> 00:29:14,477
so he's quite angry.

577
00:29:14,738 --> 00:29:16,919
So this little difference, right?

578
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:21,141
Well, there is that, but it seems that at the beginning,

579
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:23,482
because it didn't discover with its eyes,

580
00:29:24,430 --> 00:29:25,871
what was in its world, right?

581
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,973
It knew what was in its world, but when you lied to it,

582
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,575
why didn't it know what was not in its world?

583
00:29:32,916 --> 00:29:34,177
Because it cannot see everything.

584
00:29:34,197 --> 00:29:35,599
We have a perception model here.

585
00:29:35,619 --> 00:29:38,441
So what you can't see will be inside its memory.

586
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:44,682
But maybe I am able to see something that is in front of the rocket that he was not able to see.

587
00:29:45,222 --> 00:29:50,304
And in this case, that's why he was still checking and then be surprised that I actually lied to him.

588
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:54,925
So there's a camera view that it sees that is different from yours.

589
00:29:55,125 --> 00:29:57,246
So yeah, the agent has a perception module.

590
00:29:59,294 --> 00:30:01,635
just a cone or something in front of him and just

591
00:30:02,496 --> 00:30:03,897
add this knowledge to its memory.

592
00:30:04,497 --> 00:30:07,860
It's not what the player is seeing, it's what he is seeing himself.

593
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:12,543
Okay, thank you.

594
00:30:12,783 --> 00:30:16,806
If you have other questions we can go to the wrap-up room. I don't know which one it is.

595
00:30:16,826 --> 00:30:18,868
I'll just discuss after. No problem.

596
00:30:20,289 --> 00:30:20,529
Thank you.
