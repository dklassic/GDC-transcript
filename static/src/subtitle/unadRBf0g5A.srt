1
00:00:06,609 --> 00:00:16,320
Good morning GDC, hi. I am supposed to remind you to turn off your noise makers, so please do

2
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,025
that now. And let's get started. So, I'm going to start with a little bit of background.

3
00:00:21,897 --> 00:00:29,422
My name is Clemens Scott. I'm the co-founder of a small studio based in Vienna, in Austria,

4
00:00:29,482 --> 00:00:38,207
called Broken Rules, which was founded by these five guys. Actually, the studio itself

5
00:00:39,168 --> 00:00:39,768
was founded by...

6
00:00:41,610 --> 00:00:56,539
These three, Felix, Jan and Peter, who made a prototype of a game that was nominated for the Student Award Showcase at IGF in 2007.

7
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,843
And after that they made a full game out of it and it was called And Yet It Moves.

8
00:01:02,363 --> 00:01:06,966
And it was done in 2009, which was also the time when our studio was founded.

9
00:01:07,766 --> 00:01:09,207
And a short while later...

10
00:01:10,048 --> 00:01:16,693
Martin and I joined the team and together as a team of five people we created two games.

11
00:01:17,593 --> 00:01:23,718
The first one was a Wii U launch title called Chasing Aurora and the second one was the PC

12
00:01:23,778 --> 00:01:32,144
follow-up called Secrets of Raticon that was released in 2014 I think. And now a few years later

13
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:38,808
Felix and me are working on a game called Old Man's Journey,

14
00:01:40,570 --> 00:01:46,714
which is a game about an old man living by himself in a house on a cliff by the sea.

15
00:01:47,974 --> 00:01:55,279
And he one day receives a letter, and upon reading the letter, he just packs his stuff and starts walking.

16
00:01:56,113 --> 00:02:01,315
And as he walks, he kind of thinks back on his life,

17
00:02:02,175 --> 00:02:05,516
and players find out what happened to him

18
00:02:05,736 --> 00:02:07,476
that he ended up in this house.

19
00:02:08,636 --> 00:02:12,297
And the gameplay, or the game itself, looks like this.

20
00:02:12,797 --> 00:02:14,458
So this is the core gameplay mechanic.

21
00:02:14,658 --> 00:02:18,378
What you do is you can touch the hills and shape them.

22
00:02:19,289 --> 00:02:21,112
to create intersections between two hills

23
00:02:21,192 --> 00:02:23,034
and wherever there's a visible intersection

24
00:02:23,054 --> 00:02:24,997
between two hills, the old man can jump

25
00:02:25,237 --> 00:02:26,459
from one hill to the other.

26
00:02:29,383 --> 00:02:30,805
But when we started out with the game,

27
00:02:30,985 --> 00:02:32,006
it did not look like this.

28
00:02:32,707 --> 00:02:34,209
It looked like this.

29
00:02:35,666 --> 00:02:40,290
and we had no idea of what the visuals were going to be for that game.

30
00:02:41,271 --> 00:02:46,556
We had total creative freedom on how to develop this thing,

31
00:02:46,716 --> 00:02:50,740
which is great, but choosing a direction of a project

32
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,064
that will dictate most of your wake time for the next two years

33
00:02:55,124 --> 00:02:57,566
and your financial future demands

34
00:02:57,786 --> 00:02:59,848
to be a really well-considered decision, right?

35
00:03:00,909 --> 00:03:06,171
And creative freedom is the reason that I decided to run my own studio.

36
00:03:06,551 --> 00:03:10,413
But, the more creative freedom you have, or the more freedom in general,

37
00:03:10,473 --> 00:03:13,095
the harder it is to make a choice which way to go.

38
00:03:14,375 --> 00:03:16,316
But luckily, there are tools.

39
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:17,657
Introducing...

40
00:03:17,677 --> 00:03:19,218
The Box.

41
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:28,628
The box really is just a metaphor for setting yourself goals based on your own constraints.

42
00:03:28,989 --> 00:03:41,894
And you can kind of use that to question or to test your own decisions or try to find answers to questions that you have about like where you're going to go and how you're...

43
00:03:42,475 --> 00:03:49,146
going to do it. So this in and on itself is not a very particularly new concept and many people use it in project

44
00:03:49,667 --> 00:03:56,197
management, but it's also one of the the cornerstones of why Oldman's journey looks like the way it does.

45
00:03:57,379 --> 00:04:01,844
And to us this has like sort of like three main ingredients

46
00:04:01,984 --> 00:04:05,929
and that is the constraints that you have

47
00:04:06,049 --> 00:04:10,214
as a game developer and the goals that you have

48
00:04:10,554 --> 00:04:12,756
for the project and sort of the strategies

49
00:04:12,997 --> 00:04:16,661
that you will sort of how you will achieve those goals.

50
00:04:17,762 --> 00:04:25,289
So when looking at the constraints of broken rules for us as a team, there are kind of like three things.

51
00:04:25,509 --> 00:04:32,615
The one is then games that we want to make, games that we are able to make, and games that currently have a market.

52
00:04:33,116 --> 00:04:34,977
And so the games that we want to make...

53
00:04:36,619 --> 00:04:42,861
are things like they push the boundaries of the medium and they offer unique experiences

54
00:04:44,262 --> 00:04:46,243
and usually are not free-to-play.

55
00:04:47,543 --> 00:04:48,824
Games that we are able to make

56
00:04:51,424 --> 00:04:59,148
often have sort of a strong aesthetic and builds believable worlds that players want to spend time in.

57
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:06,332
And the interesting one is kind of like the third one, and especially where the overlap is.

58
00:05:06,553 --> 00:05:12,556
So, games that currently have a market do not push the boundaries of our medium, at least not too hard,

59
00:05:13,356 --> 00:05:17,098
and are also often free to play, but with exceptions.

60
00:05:18,779 --> 00:05:27,388
But the overlaps here are kind of like the unique experiences and the unique aesthetics or the high production value.

61
00:05:29,210 --> 00:05:33,074
So with these constraints in mind, Felix and I...

62
00:05:33,835 --> 00:05:37,556
set up the goals for what Old Man's Journey was going to be

63
00:05:37,716 --> 00:05:41,598
like way before we were actually like producing the game.

64
00:05:42,078 --> 00:05:44,319
When we were thinking about what are we going to do next?

65
00:05:45,599 --> 00:05:46,499
What do we want to make?

66
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,761
And we decided we wanted to make a premium high quality

67
00:05:50,081 --> 00:05:52,342
one time experience type of game

68
00:05:53,862 --> 00:05:57,343
that connects with players on an emotional level.

69
00:05:58,224 --> 00:06:00,045
that is not as common in games.

70
00:06:00,365 --> 00:06:02,866
In our case, our starting emotion

71
00:06:02,906 --> 00:06:04,687
was sort of the sense of wanderlust

72
00:06:04,947 --> 00:06:09,049
and wanting to travel and be somewhere else.

73
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,451
And also we wanted to make a game that has mass appeal

74
00:06:13,612 --> 00:06:17,714
without compromising our own artistic integrity.

75
00:06:18,614 --> 00:06:18,794
Also,

76
00:06:23,914 --> 00:06:25,895
We wanted to make a game that is so beautiful,

77
00:06:26,035 --> 00:06:28,197
it will stick out of the mass and make editors

78
00:06:28,237 --> 00:06:29,958
want to decorate their storefronts with it,

79
00:06:30,078 --> 00:06:32,420
which means features for us, and that is good.

80
00:06:34,722 --> 00:06:37,744
We also wanted to make a game that is so accessible,

81
00:06:38,024 --> 00:06:40,866
it can be enjoyed by a widely arranged demographic

82
00:06:41,447 --> 00:06:44,429
using the simplest form of input, which is a single touch.

83
00:06:44,849 --> 00:06:46,430
So, you can move the old man

84
00:06:46,490 --> 00:06:48,612
by just pointing and clicking somewhere,

85
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,933
and he will walk over there, and you can ...

86
00:06:50,438 --> 00:06:52,619
drag the hills by just touching them.

87
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:56,502
And finally, we wanted to make a game

88
00:06:56,702 --> 00:06:58,324
for the so-called reading nook,

89
00:06:58,604 --> 00:07:01,046
so the place that you sort of retreat to,

90
00:07:01,386 --> 00:07:03,187
that where you kind of read a book

91
00:07:03,407 --> 00:07:10,733
or have kind of like no time pressure to enjoy something.

92
00:07:11,593 --> 00:07:13,114
So we decided we wanted to make a game

93
00:07:13,134 --> 00:07:16,817
that has about 19 minutes of playtime and about 15 levels.

94
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:23,291
These were the goals, but what strategies

95
00:07:25,151 --> 00:07:31,153
were we going to use to achieve our goals?

96
00:07:31,333 --> 00:07:34,294
One of the strategies that we thought we wanted to employ

97
00:07:34,334 --> 00:07:35,514
was to tell a simple story

98
00:07:35,534 --> 00:07:38,575
that everyone can relate to only using images.

99
00:07:38,975 --> 00:07:41,516
There is no text in the game, there is no localization,

100
00:07:41,596 --> 00:07:42,336
there is no reading.

101
00:07:45,561 --> 00:07:50,345
All the story parts and the whole narrative is told through the old man's memories.

102
00:07:50,585 --> 00:07:55,769
So at the end of each level, he kind of sits down and rests and then thinks about his life.

103
00:07:56,269 --> 00:08:01,633
And then one of an image, an animated vignette like image like this is shown.

104
00:08:02,233 --> 00:08:07,597
In this case, when he was still young and he went on a road trip vacation with his

105
00:08:08,522 --> 00:08:20,426
then future wife. And the core theme of the narrative is the topic of family. So we think

106
00:08:20,526 --> 00:08:27,388
that family is a topic that everybody has some sort of connection to on an emotional level. So

107
00:08:27,809 --> 00:08:33,731
if you have family or not or whatever relation you have to your family, there's some sort of

108
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:36,680
emotional connection to that immediately.

109
00:08:38,561 --> 00:08:44,445
So, that was the one thing. The other thing was that we decided that we wanted to align every single element,

110
00:08:44,565 --> 00:08:50,769
every choice that we make in the game, we wanted to align to a so-called emotional progression curve,

111
00:08:51,209 --> 00:08:56,772
which is an idea that we took from that game company who did that with Flower and Journey.

112
00:08:59,814 --> 00:09:03,495
emotional progression curve looks like this in our case.

113
00:09:03,535 --> 00:09:05,796
So at the bottom you see the numbers for the levels

114
00:09:06,476 --> 00:09:10,657
and the line going up and down is kind of like positive

115
00:09:10,697 --> 00:09:11,757
and negative emotions.

116
00:09:12,397 --> 00:09:15,438
And as the player progresses through the game,

117
00:09:16,779 --> 00:09:21,520
this is where sort of like the level of where we are

118
00:09:21,580 --> 00:09:23,620
in terms of positivity and negativity

119
00:09:23,701 --> 00:09:24,901
or happiness and sadness.

120
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:27,342
either the old man experiences,

121
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:32,805
but that is also reflected in all of the puzzle,

122
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:38,327
game mechanics, and the interactive elements

123
00:09:38,387 --> 00:09:39,608
and basically everything else.

124
00:09:39,988 --> 00:09:41,869
So this was really useful for us

125
00:09:41,989 --> 00:09:45,171
to help pick the right environments

126
00:09:45,411 --> 00:09:47,472
and help pick the right landscapes and moods

127
00:09:47,552 --> 00:09:49,113
and colors for wherever we are.

128
00:09:49,493 --> 00:09:52,894
It helped pick prototypes, distribute different puzzles.

129
00:09:53,555 --> 00:09:55,376
and cut content if necessary,

130
00:09:55,696 --> 00:09:59,559
and it also made communicating with the team a lot easier

131
00:09:59,599 --> 00:10:03,301
because we could tell them what emotions to aim for

132
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:04,982
for whatever they were working on.

133
00:10:08,975 --> 00:10:12,476
Finally, we also decided we wanted to build a world

134
00:10:12,556 --> 00:10:15,837
filled with whimsical details and rich interactivity.

135
00:10:15,897 --> 00:10:17,358
So there would be all these things

136
00:10:17,398 --> 00:10:20,218
that you can sort of like touch and they would react

137
00:10:20,838 --> 00:10:21,759
and something would happen.

138
00:10:23,379 --> 00:10:27,680
And lastly, which is a little bit of a no brainer in a way,

139
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,401
but assemble a team of excellent collaborators.

140
00:10:30,881 --> 00:10:32,702
which I'm pointing out here because

141
00:10:33,903 --> 00:10:36,324
one of those collaborators is Salon Alpin

142
00:10:36,885 --> 00:10:40,447
and they are an animation studio that are partially based in Vienna

143
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:42,408
at the same office as we are

144
00:10:42,748 --> 00:10:45,570
and partially based in Lisbon in Portugal

145
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,932
and they are specialized on visual narrative

146
00:10:50,132 --> 00:10:53,034
so basically telling story only using imagery

147
00:10:53,715 --> 00:10:57,337
and Lipp, who is the art director of Salon Alpin

148
00:10:57,417 --> 00:10:59,038
played a very important role in

149
00:10:59,538 --> 00:11:01,519
finding the art style for Old Man's Journey.

150
00:11:02,459 --> 00:11:04,360
And that's basically it.

151
00:11:05,060 --> 00:11:08,362
This is where our box is done in a way.

152
00:11:08,382 --> 00:11:12,143
Now we have all these components that we can then use

153
00:11:12,203 --> 00:11:14,984
to inform the decisions that we were going to make

154
00:11:15,024 --> 00:11:15,705
with the art style.

155
00:11:16,285 --> 00:11:18,286
And that is a nice concept, right?

156
00:11:18,386 --> 00:11:20,427
But it still does not really explain

157
00:11:20,547 --> 00:11:22,327
how we got from this to this.

158
00:11:24,609 --> 00:11:26,431
And that is still the same level, right?

159
00:11:26,551 --> 00:11:31,737
So this was one of the is the first level in the game and it introduces the players to

160
00:11:32,638 --> 00:11:34,661
to being able to switch between hills.

161
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:39,927
So we all we had was this pink figure and this blue kind of like target marker to tell players where to go.

162
00:11:40,748 --> 00:11:43,250
And that was that.

163
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,652
And when we first only had these prototypes,

164
00:11:47,914 --> 00:11:51,016
I started, and also when our box was not yet done,

165
00:11:51,416 --> 00:11:53,458
I started making mock-ups for the game

166
00:11:53,518 --> 00:11:55,059
and testing out various things.

167
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,002
And since our game, our previous game,

168
00:11:58,122 --> 00:12:00,424
have been very much based on vectors,

169
00:12:00,944 --> 00:12:02,846
it was sort of, for me, a logical step

170
00:12:03,166 --> 00:12:04,728
to do something in vectors.

171
00:12:04,748 --> 00:12:08,791
And the game was also based on these flat shaded shapes.

172
00:12:09,232 --> 00:12:12,775
And it seems like that would be a good approach

173
00:12:12,915 --> 00:12:16,278
because I came from a gameplay side of things.

174
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:19,680
So my ideas were always informed about, you know,

175
00:12:20,401 --> 00:12:24,382
by then already worrying about things like readability and that player would know where

176
00:12:24,402 --> 00:12:31,065
they would be going. So this was another mock-up that I created and it also had the very first

177
00:12:31,165 --> 00:12:37,167
character design of the old man which was an egg-headed potato-nosed old clown with a tiny

178
00:12:37,247 --> 00:12:38,388
backpack and a jumpsuit.

179
00:12:39,188 --> 00:12:44,211
And we pretty much realized immediately that was not going to cut it.

180
00:12:44,812 --> 00:12:50,356
And so I played around with different vector designs

181
00:12:50,476 --> 00:12:56,019
and very stylized variants of this old farmer guy or something

182
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,320
that could be the player.

183
00:12:58,401 --> 00:13:01,743
And we did not really know about the character of the old man by then.

184
00:13:01,823 --> 00:13:02,684
I was just kind of like...

185
00:13:03,966 --> 00:13:06,009
playing around and seeing where we could go.

186
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:09,234
And so I kind of like did more,

187
00:13:09,594 --> 00:13:13,220
did sort of like this key art mock-up type of thing

188
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,101
that looked like this.

189
00:13:14,121 --> 00:13:15,724
And it was also sort of.

190
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:20,422
informed by concerns of the core gameplay.

191
00:13:20,482 --> 00:13:21,883
Like you could immediately read,

192
00:13:21,963 --> 00:13:25,085
okay, there are these hills and you have these intersections

193
00:13:25,245 --> 00:13:27,106
and that this is sort of like what's going on,

194
00:13:27,166 --> 00:13:30,529
but there was no real emotional hook to this whatsoever

195
00:13:30,589 --> 00:13:33,771
because intersections are not like a good.

196
00:13:34,291 --> 00:13:36,352
emotional hook for anything, probably.

197
00:13:36,992 --> 00:13:41,254
And so, we decided to hire Lip of Solo Narpin

198
00:13:41,634 --> 00:13:45,956
to come up with some concept art for the game.

199
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,518
And his approach was radically different.

200
00:13:48,578 --> 00:13:51,419
So, him coming from a cinematic background,

201
00:13:51,479 --> 00:13:54,440
he did not give two cents about readability

202
00:13:54,540 --> 00:13:57,322
or gameplay or whatever that stuff was.

203
00:13:58,182 --> 00:14:00,943
He just aimed, or his approach was all about

204
00:14:01,063 --> 00:14:03,184
vibe and emotionality and textures.

205
00:14:03,925 --> 00:14:07,632
and that suited much better for what we had set out for

206
00:14:07,652 --> 00:14:11,780
and what sort of like our box was kind of like developing towards.

207
00:14:13,695 --> 00:14:17,438
And it also had the character of the old man,

208
00:14:17,498 --> 00:14:20,961
which already kind of looks like what it does right now.

209
00:14:21,301 --> 00:14:23,783
But at the same time, when he was doing that,

210
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:26,925
we also came up, we thought about who the old man was.

211
00:14:27,426 --> 00:14:30,148
And so we came up with all these kind of character traits

212
00:14:30,268 --> 00:14:34,651
about him and the three main characters in the story.

213
00:14:35,212 --> 00:14:37,213
And we could communicate that to Lip.

214
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:41,798
started sketching around and assembling a couple of ideas

215
00:14:42,319 --> 00:14:47,384
and came up with this design which is pretty much what he looks like in game now.

216
00:14:47,524 --> 00:14:49,787
This was pretty close to the final design.

217
00:14:50,307 --> 00:14:53,931
So, we were really happy with those results that he made but...

218
00:14:55,252 --> 00:14:59,334
We felt we needed to figure out a way how to translate that into the game.

219
00:14:59,394 --> 00:15:04,016
So we asked him to do another mock-up of something that was closer to the in-game thing.

220
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,076
And he did this.

221
00:15:06,977 --> 00:15:14,380
And while we really liked, or I really liked the textures of everything, and also kind of liked the lighting,

222
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:21,262
It was still very hard to read and there were still technical aspects about it

223
00:15:21,342 --> 00:15:24,723
where we did not know how we would implement that technically.

224
00:15:24,963 --> 00:15:32,845
This was the point where Lipp's non-existing experience in making games

225
00:15:33,225 --> 00:15:36,686
started to become a little bit of a difficulty.

226
00:15:36,746 --> 00:15:42,268
So what I did was to go back into one of our prototypes, which looked like this.

227
00:15:42,868 --> 00:15:45,150
and try to apply some of those ideas

228
00:15:45,710 --> 00:15:47,092
that he had put on the table.

229
00:15:47,472 --> 00:15:49,974
So in this case, this is a level where players learn

230
00:15:50,014 --> 00:15:52,496
that you can drop down waterfalls.

231
00:15:52,536 --> 00:15:56,760
They act like sort of like one-way downward conveyor belts

232
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,281
in terms of gameplay.

233
00:15:59,022 --> 00:16:02,722
And again, I was coming from the gameplay side of things,

234
00:16:02,783 --> 00:16:05,243
but I tried to apply those ideas

235
00:16:05,503 --> 00:16:08,684
and do something more kind of like painterly and textures

236
00:16:09,004 --> 00:16:12,965
and found the results pretty mediocre

237
00:16:13,485 --> 00:16:15,165
and not very interesting.

238
00:16:15,365 --> 00:16:19,046
And I was kind of, I felt like I just couldn't pull it off

239
00:16:19,126 --> 00:16:19,867
what he was doing,

240
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:23,087
and that my skill set just wasn't high enough.

241
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:23,207
So...

242
00:16:25,727 --> 00:16:28,029
Since I was going to be the lead artist on the game,

243
00:16:28,810 --> 00:16:32,593
we had to find a style that I could make work.

244
00:16:33,514 --> 00:16:35,595
Instead of doing something painterly,

245
00:16:35,635 --> 00:16:39,138
we thought, okay, what could we do?

246
00:16:40,299 --> 00:16:43,021
Maybe what about 3D, doing something in 3D?

247
00:16:43,202 --> 00:16:48,806
I went into Blender and did this low poly type of mock-up thing

248
00:16:49,347 --> 00:16:51,208
of what that same scene could look like.

249
00:16:52,109 --> 00:16:53,810
We got the waterfall, we got the three hills.

250
00:16:54,391 --> 00:16:57,333
It's the same scene built in 3D.

251
00:16:57,453 --> 00:16:59,895
And we surprisingly really liked the results.

252
00:17:00,676 --> 00:17:01,977
It had, for the first time,

253
00:17:02,037 --> 00:17:04,338
it had very vibrant, nice color choices.

254
00:17:04,418 --> 00:17:06,280
It was still kind of readable.

255
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,463
And one of the things that we liked

256
00:17:10,543 --> 00:17:13,105
is that you get this instant lighting situation

257
00:17:13,125 --> 00:17:14,386
where you just place one light

258
00:17:14,486 --> 00:17:16,688
and all of a sudden you got shadows and you get mood

259
00:17:16,748 --> 00:17:18,830
and this just kind of came along with that.

260
00:17:20,491 --> 00:17:23,853
And so we decided we wanted to experiment with that a little bit more

261
00:17:24,513 --> 00:17:27,714
and do another one of those

262
00:17:27,914 --> 00:17:31,516
and try to solve some other problems as we did that.

263
00:17:31,656 --> 00:17:36,318
So in this shot, the camera is pretty close to the player,

264
00:17:36,778 --> 00:17:39,779
and so we decided we wanted to experiment with some more extreme distances.

265
00:17:40,580 --> 00:17:47,084
like this one. So that this dark grey hill could be pretty far in the distance and maybe we could

266
00:17:47,244 --> 00:17:53,527
we could do something about that. And one more thing that we were kind of like asking ourselves

267
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:57,170
about was what would we would be doing with that blue flag.

268
00:17:57,470 --> 00:18:00,474
But because we felt it was like a super gamey element

269
00:18:00,554 --> 00:18:03,018
that we wanted to get rid of in the final game.

270
00:18:03,058 --> 00:18:06,503
So we had to find some solution for better signposting

271
00:18:06,523 --> 00:18:07,844
so players would know where to go.

272
00:18:07,925 --> 00:18:09,226
Because if you remove that flag

273
00:18:09,287 --> 00:18:10,809
and just present that with players,

274
00:18:10,869 --> 00:18:12,771
nobody would know where to go, right?

275
00:18:15,013 --> 00:18:18,915
I tried to tackle both of these issues and came up with this.

276
00:18:19,775 --> 00:18:23,336
Again, we really kind of liked it.

277
00:18:24,057 --> 00:18:26,658
The colors were really nice and vibrant,

278
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:31,240
and it also introduced something that is still in the game today,

279
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:34,641
which are color hue shifts from top to bottom.

280
00:18:34,661 --> 00:18:37,202
When you look at that yellow hill, for example,

281
00:18:38,223 --> 00:18:41,304
it is brightly yellow on top and fades into this orange

282
00:18:41,344 --> 00:18:42,745
becoming green eventually.

283
00:18:43,185 --> 00:18:47,048
And this is a concept that is still throughout the game today.

284
00:18:47,828 --> 00:18:51,691
And also it kind of supported that emotion of Wanderlust

285
00:18:51,811 --> 00:18:54,793
and seeing the distance and wanting to go there,

286
00:18:54,853 --> 00:18:56,555
which we kind of set up in our box.

287
00:18:56,595 --> 00:18:57,395
So that was good.

288
00:18:58,156 --> 00:19:02,119
And I put this little hillside village there

289
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,841
to try to solve the issue of signposting.

290
00:19:06,442 --> 00:19:12,354
But it still lacked a lot of the details that we wanted to have and sort of that would make it feel rich, right?

291
00:19:12,755 --> 00:19:17,445
And I did not really know how to approach that because I'm not really a good modeler at all.

292
00:19:17,818 --> 00:19:26,244
So I would be super slow with that and I'm not really a good painter at all either, so I did not know how to go on from there.

293
00:19:26,804 --> 00:19:35,270
And at this point I stumbled across a music video called Latin Voice, which was produced by the animation studio Encyclopedia Pictura.

294
00:19:35,690 --> 00:19:42,435
And I really liked that video, so I started researching about who made it and about the animation studio behind that,

295
00:19:42,515 --> 00:19:44,196
and I found the concept artwork by...

296
00:19:44,912 --> 00:19:46,693
a guy called Isaiah Saxon.

297
00:19:47,273 --> 00:19:49,833
And this image just really inspired me

298
00:19:49,913 --> 00:19:51,354
to go back to my own roots,

299
00:19:51,394 --> 00:19:52,674
which is actually line drawing.

300
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:55,955
So that is kind of what I feel like very comfortable with,

301
00:19:56,175 --> 00:19:57,775
which is something that I've always been doing.

302
00:19:58,155 --> 00:20:02,136
So I decided to do same scene just with line drawing,

303
00:20:02,536 --> 00:20:04,497
which then ended up looking like this.

304
00:20:04,997 --> 00:20:07,097
And then I kind of just put it on top of that.

305
00:20:07,978 --> 00:20:10,800
3D mock-up using like the same colors and

306
00:20:12,242 --> 00:20:14,424
and came to this and

307
00:20:15,184 --> 00:20:17,767
So it was it was still like this similar to the mock-up

308
00:20:17,787 --> 00:20:22,151
But it contained the richness that I wanted to achieve actually I went a little bit overboard with it

309
00:20:22,311 --> 00:20:24,814
I aren't all these tiny details and

310
00:20:25,875 --> 00:20:27,316
And I really like that idea though

311
00:20:27,356 --> 00:20:31,540
you had these little workers and they're picking up their grapes putting them in their bags putting

312
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,002
on their truck driving off.

313
00:20:35,082 --> 00:20:37,843
And it could immediately imagine all these stories

314
00:20:37,903 --> 00:20:39,444
of what was going on in this world.

315
00:20:39,904 --> 00:20:42,185
The sheep kind of like bumping around there

316
00:20:42,225 --> 00:20:42,846
and stuff like that.

317
00:20:42,886 --> 00:20:43,826
So I liked that.

318
00:20:43,846 --> 00:20:47,108
It had a good depth and it gave a good idea.

319
00:20:47,388 --> 00:20:50,069
But the outlines also made everything

320
00:20:50,129 --> 00:20:52,951
a little bit too cartoonish for my taste.

321
00:20:53,671 --> 00:20:53,831
Also,

322
00:20:57,413 --> 00:21:02,696
having characters in there for the first time sort of like introduced the idea of

323
00:21:04,497 --> 00:21:05,577
scales really

324
00:21:06,558 --> 00:21:06,878
because

325
00:21:07,967 --> 00:21:12,069
On that first hill, the old man could be pretty large and very well readable,

326
00:21:12,209 --> 00:21:14,090
but as soon as he jumped on that second hill,

327
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,091
he had to be about the size of those characters.

328
00:21:16,511 --> 00:21:21,134
And jumping on the third hill, he had to be the size of that wall at the house or something.

329
00:21:21,474 --> 00:21:25,536
And then the next one back there, he would be like this tiny little dot

330
00:21:25,616 --> 00:21:28,477
that you could not even see anymore.

331
00:21:28,978 --> 00:21:32,339
So, we already then saw that distances like this

332
00:21:32,499 --> 00:21:34,520
are just not going to work in terms of gameplay.

333
00:21:37,222 --> 00:21:40,546
so we had to find some sort of middle ground and

334
00:21:40,726 --> 00:21:47,074
also like the next logical step was that if we are going to use this village as the signposting type of thing then

335
00:21:47,475 --> 00:21:54,123
Logically the next level would have to play inside the village I guess so what would that look like?

336
00:21:55,424 --> 00:21:58,606
Once again, I came back to our puzzle prototypes.

337
00:21:59,866 --> 00:22:03,588
This is one screen puzzle where players learn

338
00:22:03,608 --> 00:22:06,809
that they cannot shape the hills that they are standing on.

339
00:22:06,889 --> 00:22:11,091
They have to move on those dark gray blocks.

340
00:22:11,311 --> 00:22:12,932
They cannot be shaped, they are static.

341
00:22:13,612 --> 00:22:14,772
They are moving off that curve,

342
00:22:14,812 --> 00:22:16,693
and then they can pull up that shape below,

343
00:22:16,713 --> 00:22:18,534
and move up, and finish the Level.

344
00:22:19,194 --> 00:22:22,176
And we had to find something that could be represented,

345
00:22:23,097 --> 00:22:25,758
that could represent these dark, dark grey blocks.

346
00:22:26,479 --> 00:22:28,720
And with the idea of like making a village,

347
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:32,402
you know, I thought, you know, what about like houses or something?

348
00:22:32,442 --> 00:22:34,323
We could place houses on there and then he would be like

349
00:22:34,783 --> 00:22:36,264
chomping on the roofs of the houses.

350
00:22:36,765 --> 00:22:37,505
Maybe that could work.

351
00:22:38,485 --> 00:22:45,007
And so I roughly sketched a village with houses over the same scene.

352
00:22:46,007 --> 00:22:56,449
And I also decided in terms of better signposting, I wanted to give a better idea of where players came from,

353
00:22:56,869 --> 00:22:59,050
where the old man came from and where he was going.

354
00:22:59,130 --> 00:23:01,690
So I extended... wrong direction...

355
00:23:02,431 --> 00:23:05,955
I extended that sketch on the top and the bottom

356
00:23:06,276 --> 00:23:08,819
because I wanted to give a feeling of the old man

357
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:10,462
actually entering that village

358
00:23:10,522 --> 00:23:11,724
and then kind of like walking up

359
00:23:11,864 --> 00:23:13,226
and as he reaches like the top.

360
00:23:14,108 --> 00:23:18,812
there's nowhere else really to go and there's this hotel so this is obviously kind of like okay this

361
00:23:19,332 --> 00:23:24,377
I guess I'm here now for a place that was how I was thinking but it introduced one more

362
00:23:25,297 --> 00:23:31,943
completely new thing that we all have had camera movement or we needed to add camera movement to

363
00:23:31,963 --> 00:23:36,727
make that work and before we had only like one screen single puzzles and all of a sudden we were

364
00:23:36,887 --> 00:23:41,791
like oh okay we can have like multiple scenes and the camera can pan around and zoom and

365
00:23:42,572 --> 00:23:46,954
kind of parallaxing layers and mind blown basically.

366
00:23:47,674 --> 00:23:51,276
And but it also introduced like a whole lot of new questions

367
00:23:51,336 --> 00:23:52,856
and problems that we had to solve.

368
00:23:53,277 --> 00:23:55,698
But that's sort of a different topic.

369
00:23:57,259 --> 00:24:00,760
But also the ideas for all of these houses,

370
00:24:00,820 --> 00:24:03,341
they didn't come out of nowhere when Felix and I.

371
00:24:03,842 --> 00:24:07,405
we're talking about the idea of sort of like making a level inside a village.

372
00:24:08,606 --> 00:24:15,613
Felix came with the idea of, he proposed an Italian town called Cinque Terre.

373
00:24:17,782 --> 00:24:19,443
When I saw that image, it was kind of like,

374
00:24:19,723 --> 00:24:22,084
oh wow, yeah, I want to be there.

375
00:24:22,184 --> 00:24:23,524
I want to be there right now.

376
00:24:23,604 --> 00:24:24,865
You know, this is so beautiful.

377
00:24:24,925 --> 00:24:26,045
It's so vibrant.

378
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:27,406
It's great.

379
00:24:27,506 --> 00:24:29,407
I'm going to take that as an inspiration

380
00:24:29,467 --> 00:24:32,168
for our little mountain village.

381
00:24:32,708 --> 00:24:35,669
And I started sort of like gathering images

382
00:24:35,769 --> 00:24:37,109
and assembling a mood board

383
00:24:37,329 --> 00:24:39,790
and of little kind of these mountain villages

384
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:43,252
and little street scenes and houses and things like that.

385
00:24:44,052 --> 00:24:44,152
And...

386
00:24:44,892 --> 00:24:48,637
When you look at those images, especially the top two ones,

387
00:24:48,937 --> 00:24:51,801
especially maybe the first one, the top right one

388
00:24:52,041 --> 00:24:55,004
with this yellow house, and then you look at this.

389
00:24:57,047 --> 00:25:00,110
This is kind of similar, I guess.

390
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:02,353
And the top left one, the green one,

391
00:25:02,854 --> 00:25:03,715
and then you look at this.

392
00:25:05,602 --> 00:25:08,866
Ah, okay, yeah, okay, that's pretty familiar there.

393
00:25:09,186 --> 00:25:12,470
So these things obviously didn't come out of nowhere,

394
00:25:12,550 --> 00:25:14,853
but they were interpreted in the style of the game.

395
00:25:15,494 --> 00:25:20,600
So I did the sketch and I extended it even more to add.

396
00:25:21,241 --> 00:25:28,328
like a bit of sky or a lot of sky actually because I thought it was good for the composition and it had that nice vertical bookmark like feel

397
00:25:29,249 --> 00:25:42,601
and started putting down some colors and at this point I showed it to Felix and we only had like this super rough thumbnail and he was like yeah this this is it I want to do that that is something he already kind of like started dreaming about yeah this

398
00:25:43,622 --> 00:25:45,644
makes me feel like I want to spend time there.

399
00:25:46,465 --> 00:25:50,128
And in terms of colors, it also already shows

400
00:25:50,168 --> 00:25:53,251
like the first sort of like compromise

401
00:25:53,311 --> 00:25:55,352
of what we did in terms of realism

402
00:25:55,733 --> 00:26:01,538
and being natural in a natural, believable environment.

403
00:26:02,182 --> 00:26:07,446
And that was that we kind of like used very, very natural colors,

404
00:26:07,606 --> 00:26:10,308
but for the hills used pretty magical colors

405
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,891
because there are no blue hills or red hills like that.

406
00:26:14,392 --> 00:26:17,394
But they are within the rest of the color scheme,

407
00:26:17,614 --> 00:26:18,675
the rest of the color palette.

408
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:22,318
So they don't stick out too much, but they're clearly readable.

409
00:26:22,899 --> 00:26:24,400
And since...

410
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:28,385
the one really magical thing in the games are the hills,

411
00:26:28,465 --> 00:26:30,408
that you can shape them and just jump around.

412
00:26:30,849 --> 00:26:33,512
It's also okay if they have sort of like magical colors

413
00:26:33,532 --> 00:26:34,434
that signalize them.

414
00:26:35,095 --> 00:26:40,002
And so it is easy for players to accept that fact.

415
00:26:42,124 --> 00:26:48,267
So, yeah, I just started detailing that a little bit and added some sky, and at this

416
00:26:48,427 --> 00:26:50,428
point I basically call it done.

417
00:26:50,889 --> 00:26:53,090
This was it.

418
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:59,373
It was like the benchmark of what we wanted to achieve, and also the image that we used

419
00:26:59,413 --> 00:27:01,575
to communicate of where we wanted to go.

420
00:27:02,055 --> 00:27:03,596
But it still lacked sort of like the...

421
00:27:04,837 --> 00:27:07,857
the amount of detail and we still also didn't know if we,

422
00:27:07,957 --> 00:27:10,938
you know, what was with that idea of doing stuff in 3D,

423
00:27:10,958 --> 00:27:14,019
you know, maybe that, you know, especially now that we have a moving camera,

424
00:27:14,059 --> 00:27:16,299
you know, and 3D objects have actual perspective,

425
00:27:16,339 --> 00:27:19,420
that could be really cool. Let's keep on experimenting with that.

426
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:23,781
So, I blocked the same three houses in Blender

427
00:27:23,881 --> 00:27:26,862
and slapped some textures on top of that

428
00:27:27,102 --> 00:27:30,803
and did a couple of hill textures

429
00:27:30,943 --> 00:27:33,603
and we put it in Unity in a level and we had this.

430
00:27:34,504 --> 00:27:38,386
and while we kind of really liked the results,

431
00:27:38,426 --> 00:27:42,609
but I felt I disliked the geometrical look

432
00:27:42,689 --> 00:27:43,970
and the very clean edges,

433
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:48,393
so we invested some more time into figuring out

434
00:27:48,473 --> 00:27:50,114
if we could come up with a shader

435
00:27:50,154 --> 00:27:52,656
that would imitate textured edges,

436
00:27:53,737 --> 00:27:55,318
but I never really found the results

437
00:27:55,338 --> 00:27:57,499
to be particularly convincing.

438
00:27:58,340 --> 00:28:01,262
The rest of the team did lean sort of towards the option

439
00:28:01,302 --> 00:28:02,763
of doing stuff in 3D,

440
00:28:04,344 --> 00:28:07,666
But I felt I had to give the 2D version a better case

441
00:28:07,766 --> 00:28:11,168
because I actually added a lot of detail to the 3D model

442
00:28:11,368 --> 00:28:14,129
that the painting before did not have.

443
00:28:14,509 --> 00:28:16,851
So the concept thing looked like this.

444
00:28:16,871 --> 00:28:18,551
So it was still a lot more simpler.

445
00:28:19,212 --> 00:28:20,372
And so I went back.

446
00:28:21,273 --> 00:28:23,735
and added more details to that and came up with this.

447
00:28:24,255 --> 00:28:28,059
And this is sort of pretty much what it is in game right now.

448
00:28:30,281 --> 00:28:34,824
So yeah, now I felt like they were sort of on par in terms of quality

449
00:28:35,445 --> 00:28:41,650
and we could not decide which way to go, which way to go, what we liked better.

450
00:28:42,391 --> 00:28:47,874
And so we came up with all these pros and cons and lists of what it would mean to choose

451
00:28:48,014 --> 00:28:52,557
like one way or the other in terms of production and what the pipeline would look like and

452
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:57,480
what the possible problems could be doing it this way or that way and tried to gather

453
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:03,084
as much information as possible to make an informed decision and came up with a tie.

454
00:29:03,724 --> 00:29:05,586
And we still did not know how to do it.

455
00:29:07,248 --> 00:29:09,772
So, we consulted our box.

456
00:29:10,513 --> 00:29:12,135
And what did our box say?

457
00:29:12,155 --> 00:29:15,000
It said we have experience making 2D games,

458
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,464
we have no experience making 3D games.

459
00:29:18,359 --> 00:29:23,402
So that was kind of an obvious hint that we maybe should stick with 2D.

460
00:29:23,883 --> 00:29:28,345
But I also thought that the natural stroke of a painted line

461
00:29:29,906 --> 00:29:33,509
better supports the tone of the game and what we wanted to achieve.

462
00:29:33,849 --> 00:29:36,631
But in the end, it really ended up with being a gut decision.

463
00:29:36,711 --> 00:29:39,392
That was still like by the end, we just said, OK, you know what?

464
00:29:39,893 --> 00:29:42,915
Let's just do it 2D because we feel better about it.

465
00:29:43,575 --> 00:29:44,675
And that's what it is.

466
00:29:44,815 --> 00:29:46,836
But we still kept on sort of like experimenting

467
00:29:46,896 --> 00:29:50,678
from here and there with 3D elements.

468
00:29:50,718 --> 00:29:52,419
So at the end of this hotel scene,

469
00:29:52,439 --> 00:29:54,499
or at the end of this level,

470
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:59,422
there's the scene where this bus drives in

471
00:29:59,662 --> 00:30:02,723
and we initially like modeled it in 3D

472
00:30:02,743 --> 00:30:05,084
to see if it would be a cool effect

473
00:30:05,504 --> 00:30:07,145
that you could see the front and the back

474
00:30:07,185 --> 00:30:08,025
depending on where.

475
00:30:08,605 --> 00:30:10,267
where the bus was in the scene.

476
00:30:10,528 --> 00:30:13,731
But we never quite found, figured out a good way

477
00:30:13,831 --> 00:30:16,194
to make it really integrate in the scene.

478
00:30:16,334 --> 00:30:20,078
And so we just decided against using 3D models

479
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,379
for most of the game.

480
00:30:23,568 --> 00:30:30,332
And yeah, technically, it still is sort of like a mixed technique,

481
00:30:31,873 --> 00:30:34,034
because behind the scenes, our Levels look like this.

482
00:30:34,574 --> 00:30:38,236
They are all just flat layers stacked on top of each other

483
00:30:38,356 --> 00:30:39,977
going into the distance.

484
00:30:40,617 --> 00:30:42,298
And here is another Level

485
00:30:42,478 --> 00:30:48,221
that shows what it looks like behind the scenes, basically.

486
00:30:48,642 --> 00:30:48,882
So ...

487
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:53,363
This is also one of the core ideas that informs the art style.

488
00:30:53,783 --> 00:30:57,284
Everything is flat and everything is stacked on top of each other.

489
00:30:57,984 --> 00:31:02,165
And there's almost no real lighting in terms of volume.

490
00:31:03,465 --> 00:31:05,765
Everything is sort of like top to bottom.

491
00:31:06,005 --> 00:31:10,086
So this is easily viewed when looking at like a single asset,

492
00:31:10,146 --> 00:31:12,027
like a generic asset, like a bush.

493
00:31:12,447 --> 00:31:17,188
So the way it works is we have this basic, clear, sort of reduced shape.

494
00:31:18,928 --> 00:31:23,009
add some darker bits, some sort of shadow on the bottom,

495
00:31:24,009 --> 00:31:26,089
a little bit of lighter bits on the top, and some details,

496
00:31:26,830 --> 00:31:30,730
and add another layer with a little bit of a color shift,

497
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:34,711
and basically the same details, and then a third one,

498
00:31:35,211 --> 00:31:39,512
and this sort of gives you an idea of a bush, right?

499
00:31:39,592 --> 00:31:41,272
But there's no real volume, it's just like,

500
00:31:41,372 --> 00:31:43,093
boop, boop, boop, three layers, that's it.

501
00:31:46,054 --> 00:31:47,135
We thought that would work well,

502
00:31:48,095 --> 00:31:51,237
but then realized that when we put that in the game,

503
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,258
we would need many different color variations of these bushes,

504
00:31:54,478 --> 00:31:56,079
and saving all those sprites,

505
00:31:56,359 --> 00:31:57,700
the same sprites in different colors,

506
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,181
is not a very effective way of doing things.

507
00:32:01,002 --> 00:32:04,224
What we did was to make monochrome versions of that

508
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,305
and create a shader in Unity

509
00:32:06,665 --> 00:32:11,088
that would color map two or three colors onto that sprite,

510
00:32:11,348 --> 00:32:13,649
and we could get pretty similar results with that.

511
00:32:13,769 --> 00:32:15,710
But we could also make something like this,

512
00:32:16,471 --> 00:32:18,132
or something like this if we wanted to.

513
00:32:20,033 --> 00:32:23,195
That was good, and I still had to figure out ...

514
00:32:24,429 --> 00:32:26,351
like the overall vocabulary.

515
00:32:26,531 --> 00:32:29,515
It is easy for me to break these things down right now,

516
00:32:29,595 --> 00:32:31,517
but in reality to get to this point,

517
00:32:31,557 --> 00:32:34,300
there was like a lot of experimentation involved,

518
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,804
and also kind of a consulting lip from time to time.

519
00:32:39,781 --> 00:32:42,362
One time when I wanted to come up with an olive tree,

520
00:32:42,522 --> 00:32:43,822
and I really struggled with that,

521
00:32:44,062 --> 00:32:45,842
I asked Lip how he would do it.

522
00:32:46,382 --> 00:32:49,623
And he always had the idea of very strong lighting

523
00:32:49,683 --> 00:32:55,004
situations and sharp shadows and lots of volume,

524
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:58,005
but we could not really make that work in game

525
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,025
because if you have these strong lighting situations

526
00:33:00,165 --> 00:33:01,586
and you would shape a hill,

527
00:33:01,986 --> 00:33:04,806
the hill would sort of have to dynamically adapt

528
00:33:04,966 --> 00:33:05,507
to the lights.

529
00:33:06,267 --> 00:33:10,071
and that was for us just technically very hard to pull off

530
00:33:10,131 --> 00:33:13,054
and we did not even have an idea of how we would do it.

531
00:33:14,255 --> 00:33:16,677
So anyway, Lib proposed this as a tree

532
00:33:16,977 --> 00:33:18,819
and what I liked, a lot of the ideas

533
00:33:18,879 --> 00:33:20,181
and again sort of like the textures

534
00:33:20,261 --> 00:33:23,524
and especially the trunk, it had too much volume.

535
00:33:23,664 --> 00:33:25,105
So I did my own version of that

536
00:33:25,526 --> 00:33:27,328
and I sort of like broke it down again into.

537
00:33:28,449 --> 00:33:34,693
into those separate layers using these gradient-like color changes.

538
00:33:35,534 --> 00:33:38,817
And, yeah, we were really happy with how that looked.

539
00:33:38,937 --> 00:33:41,599
So we split it up into different parts,

540
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:44,341
imported it to Unity, reassembled it there,

541
00:33:44,501 --> 00:33:47,443
added some physics, and we had bouncy trees.

542
00:33:48,384 --> 00:33:49,925
And we were happy, that was good.

543
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,787
So, what about characters?

544
00:33:54,148 --> 00:33:58,350
There's the same scene at the top of the level at the hotel.

545
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:06,555
And this is my initial sketch of a camper guy sitting there playing his guitar,

546
00:34:06,896 --> 00:34:09,037
waiting for his girlfriend to pick him up with the bus.

547
00:34:10,354 --> 00:34:16,440
And it was OK, but I didn't feel like it was according

548
00:34:16,580 --> 00:34:19,642
to the rest of the style rules that we were currently

549
00:34:19,683 --> 00:34:21,204
sort of like building and making.

550
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,487
So again, I asked Lip if he could give me

551
00:34:24,527 --> 00:34:27,009
some feedback on that and maybe make another version.

552
00:34:27,109 --> 00:34:28,590
And this is what he came up with.

553
00:34:29,091 --> 00:34:31,153
And this was instantly like 500 times better.

554
00:34:33,835 --> 00:34:40,923
It had clear shapes, it had the color variants in it,

555
00:34:41,024 --> 00:34:45,709
everything was a lot more flat and easy to kind of like split into different parts and animate it,

556
00:34:46,190 --> 00:34:48,553
and it fit into the rest of the style, so it was great.

557
00:34:49,353 --> 00:34:52,557
So, let's look at environmental design.

558
00:34:54,426 --> 00:34:59,891
When we started our level designs, it usually is on paper and it's with sketches like this.

559
00:35:00,192 --> 00:35:07,919
And this is one of the later puzzles where you use sort of like these rolling wheels to break through walls to be able to continue.

560
00:35:08,780 --> 00:35:12,203
And that was the mechanical side of things.

561
00:35:13,182 --> 00:35:16,485
So then I sort of like, oh, wrong direction again,

562
00:35:16,946 --> 00:35:18,827
started sketching on top of that

563
00:35:18,947 --> 00:35:22,350
and adding like more different scenes in that whole level,

564
00:35:22,430 --> 00:35:25,793
different camera views and sort of like trying to figure out

565
00:35:25,853 --> 00:35:28,476
what the landscape would be and adding stuff here,

566
00:35:28,576 --> 00:35:30,297
adding stuff there, and then I would take

567
00:35:30,417 --> 00:35:32,099
one particular piece of that sketch

568
00:35:32,299 --> 00:35:35,522
and do a new sketch and sketch it on top of that

569
00:35:35,702 --> 00:35:36,102
and like,

570
00:35:36,883 --> 00:35:39,844
If you leave that like laying around for two days

571
00:35:39,884 --> 00:35:40,585
and you come back to it,

572
00:35:40,645 --> 00:35:43,226
you have no idea of what is going on anymore.

573
00:35:43,706 --> 00:35:45,927
So it is really important for,

574
00:35:46,027 --> 00:35:49,168
or was really important to pretty soon take those ideas

575
00:35:49,208 --> 00:35:50,949
that we thought out on paper

576
00:35:51,269 --> 00:35:55,031
and sort of make a little bit of better readable versions

577
00:35:55,311 --> 00:35:55,671
of that.

578
00:35:56,251 --> 00:35:58,172
And this is not the same level right now.

579
00:35:58,232 --> 00:36:00,793
Unfortunately, I don't have those sketches anymore,

580
00:36:01,054 --> 00:36:02,794
but it kind of like shows the principle of,

581
00:36:04,111 --> 00:36:12,838
like already on paper trying to figure out what the landscape aspects of that specific level would be and what all these hills and things could look like and

582
00:36:13,178 --> 00:36:20,664
this is the point where you start thinking about landscape itself. So of course that also means that the level design

583
00:36:21,485 --> 00:36:27,971
starts to modify a little bit because for things to work visually you have to push around some things move some things over there

584
00:36:28,451 --> 00:36:32,055
Try to keep with the stick with the same idea in the core

585
00:36:32,575 --> 00:36:33,416
level mechanic

586
00:36:34,757 --> 00:36:39,162
But make it work visually so this was always kind of like a push and pull between me and Felix who?

587
00:36:39,582 --> 00:36:46,208
Felix was the game the level designer and I am the decorator so to say who's trying to make things work visually

588
00:36:46,668 --> 00:36:49,169
And especially in the beginning where we did not really know

589
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:51,690
which elements are going to work

590
00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,790
and what we're gonna put where

591
00:36:53,930 --> 00:36:57,331
and there was still like all these questions and open ends.

592
00:36:58,171 --> 00:37:00,972
This approach was a little bit more chaotic.

593
00:37:01,052 --> 00:37:04,393
So we already had puzzle prototype levels

594
00:37:04,413 --> 00:37:05,993
that already kind of like looked like this.

595
00:37:06,553 --> 00:37:08,654
And then I kind of like sketched over on that

596
00:37:08,734 --> 00:37:11,174
and then we flipped those around and put them somewhere else

597
00:37:11,254 --> 00:37:14,875
and it was a very, very iterative process in that way.

598
00:37:15,535 --> 00:37:15,675
And...

599
00:37:17,496 --> 00:37:24,101
Often what I did then was to, when trying to figure out what the environment would look like,

600
00:37:24,681 --> 00:37:29,365
was to assemble a mood board and set up a basic color scheme of where we wanted to go,

601
00:37:29,945 --> 00:37:35,790
which was informed by our emotional curve, and then kind of came up with this...

602
00:37:36,830 --> 00:37:39,992
mood mock-up sort of where we are right now,

603
00:37:40,112 --> 00:37:41,913
and then kind of like do this overview,

604
00:37:42,714 --> 00:37:44,755
simple overview and start working on textures

605
00:37:44,815 --> 00:37:46,756
and trying to bring that into the level.

606
00:37:47,776 --> 00:37:49,217
As we worked on the project,

607
00:37:49,737 --> 00:37:52,579
all those processes became more and more streamlined.

608
00:37:52,839 --> 00:37:56,661
So, later on, we already exactly knew

609
00:37:56,781 --> 00:37:58,162
which puzzles were going to where,

610
00:37:58,602 --> 00:38:00,343
we were doing a lot of play testing,

611
00:38:00,463 --> 00:38:03,305
and we already knew better what worked

612
00:38:03,385 --> 00:38:05,486
and kind of like what the difficulty curve would look like.

613
00:38:06,767 --> 00:38:14,575
So we basically kind of stitched together various puzzle prototypes to make one level.

614
00:38:15,235 --> 00:38:19,519
And this is how I'm usually doing mock-ups for a single level now.

615
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:26,306
It's by going into the level, taking screenshots of each camera view in the level,

616
00:38:26,787 --> 00:38:28,989
and then I stitch them together in Photoshop.

617
00:38:29,829 --> 00:38:38,357
and I roughly sketch the landscape on top of that, already digitally.

618
00:38:38,998 --> 00:38:45,004
And also again in this case, we are in the middle of the level,

619
00:38:45,284 --> 00:38:47,726
so our emotional progression curve is kind of...

620
00:38:48,167 --> 00:38:53,911
dipping downwards at that moment and this is exactly what the theme of this level is.

621
00:38:54,311 --> 00:39:00,216
There are like a lot of waterfalls, you start at the top and you go downwards and the theme

622
00:39:00,476 --> 00:39:09,123
of the level is basically everything's going down. And so in terms of coloring that was also

623
00:39:09,183 --> 00:39:13,146
the idea of what we wanted to do, that we wanted to have something like a brighter

624
00:39:13,587 --> 00:39:18,450
warmer top and as you sort of like move downwards it gets more blue and cold.

625
00:39:19,730 --> 00:39:27,375
So now that I have the basic outlines I go in and put down the main sort of like diffuse colors

626
00:39:27,835 --> 00:39:35,640
and make sure that no two hills that connect anywhere have the same color so it stays readable

627
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:40,623
once everything is rendered and then I add some more details to those diffuse colors.

628
00:39:41,744 --> 00:39:45,266
and kind of extend the color range a little bit.

629
00:39:47,027 --> 00:39:49,989
And then at this point,

630
00:39:50,109 --> 00:39:51,830
or at this previous point, by the way,

631
00:39:51,850 --> 00:39:54,171
I'm usually also adding gradients

632
00:39:54,391 --> 00:39:57,493
and those color changes from top to bottom,

633
00:39:57,553 --> 00:39:59,874
which I did not do here for some reason.

634
00:40:00,655 --> 00:40:02,916
I think it was mainly because I was going to use

635
00:40:02,936 --> 00:40:05,818
the shadow layer as sort of a ...

636
00:40:06,638 --> 00:40:11,103
consistent way to change the colors and nails.

637
00:40:11,123 --> 00:40:14,106
You can best see that sort of on the bottom two cliffs,

638
00:40:14,206 --> 00:40:18,110
left and right, the red and the sort of greenish turquoise one

639
00:40:19,351 --> 00:40:22,394
that it changes sort of from red to something more purple,

640
00:40:22,594 --> 00:40:25,057
blue, and sort of like similar on the other side.

641
00:40:25,977 --> 00:40:32,500
And so I added some sort of adjustment layer with a gradient,

642
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,182
so I would get the effect from the top being more vibrant

643
00:40:36,222 --> 00:40:39,403
and warm to going something more blue and cool,

644
00:40:40,164 --> 00:40:42,945
and added a couple of trees to that,

645
00:40:43,105 --> 00:40:44,846
and basically the mock-up is done.

646
00:40:48,127 --> 00:40:50,949
From here on, we try to get this into the game.

647
00:40:51,890 --> 00:40:56,252
The way we do that is by first setting up the hill Textures

648
00:40:56,632 --> 00:40:59,434
to get most of the big color blocks,

649
00:40:59,514 --> 00:41:01,515
the big chunks into the Level

650
00:41:01,555 --> 00:41:04,517
so we see what it will look like really quickly.

651
00:41:04,897 --> 00:41:07,339
The way I do that is that I set up Textures

652
00:41:07,379 --> 00:41:09,020
that look something like this.

653
00:41:09,660 --> 00:41:12,262
So, I set up the colors, I set up the shapes,

654
00:41:13,023 --> 00:41:17,166
and what goes where, I put that as it is into the level

655
00:41:17,526 --> 00:41:20,909
to see if things work out with the curves

656
00:41:21,049 --> 00:41:23,071
and if nothing really glitches out.

657
00:41:23,351 --> 00:41:25,853
And so, I have these sort of like temp textures.

658
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:29,676
And then I pass it on to our support artist

659
00:41:29,876 --> 00:41:32,438
who's actually mainly a character animator,

660
00:41:32,799 --> 00:41:36,362
but also doing a lot of the art and the rendering.

661
00:41:36,702 --> 00:41:37,322
And he adds.

662
00:41:37,943 --> 00:41:40,664
he does the rendering and adds all of the details

663
00:41:40,744 --> 00:41:42,305
to make it look good.

664
00:41:43,245 --> 00:41:46,927
And before that, when all those textures are,

665
00:41:47,627 --> 00:41:49,488
or most of those textures are in the level,

666
00:41:49,809 --> 00:41:51,069
it looks something like this.

667
00:41:51,089 --> 00:41:51,149
And

668
00:41:53,830 --> 00:42:01,995
Once those are in, I again go through all the camera views and take new screenshots

669
00:42:02,755 --> 00:42:10,299
and take those screenshots in 4K because our game is based on 4K resolution so it can be

670
00:42:10,339 --> 00:42:12,220
played on like a super beefy PC.

671
00:42:13,821 --> 00:42:15,841
but also it's actually a tablet game,

672
00:42:15,901 --> 00:42:18,102
so you can play it on small resolutions as well.

673
00:42:18,122 --> 00:42:20,003
But this is 4K is our base resolution.

674
00:42:20,443 --> 00:42:23,664
So I go in there and I start drawing,

675
00:42:24,045 --> 00:42:25,685
sketching the props in there

676
00:42:25,725 --> 00:42:27,246
that I would then sort of like export

677
00:42:27,326 --> 00:42:28,466
and put back into the game.

678
00:42:28,886 --> 00:42:29,026
So.

679
00:42:30,132 --> 00:42:35,815
I got this 4K screenshot and I put a single prop in there.

680
00:42:36,175 --> 00:42:42,199
And that is now also sort of obvious, but when we started out working, like trying to

681
00:42:42,239 --> 00:42:45,121
figure out how we would make our 4K pipeline work.

682
00:42:46,181 --> 00:42:52,823
We thought we had to like each texture actually had to be like 4,000 by 4,000 pixels, which is not true obviously

683
00:42:53,944 --> 00:42:54,924
so they are

684
00:42:54,944 --> 00:43:00,526
in in the appropriate size according to this specific camera view and

685
00:43:00,606 --> 00:43:05,227
Since we know what our camera views are like we can set those up in the according resolution

686
00:43:06,368 --> 00:43:11,153
If there is ever a single prop in two different camera views,

687
00:43:11,193 --> 00:43:13,416
where one is closer and one is further away,

688
00:43:13,756 --> 00:43:15,598
we usually choose the one that is closer,

689
00:43:15,939 --> 00:43:20,363
depending on how much of you actually see.

690
00:43:22,765 --> 00:43:26,028
After that, once that is set up, I again pass it on to Brian,

691
00:43:26,328 --> 00:43:29,631
who is doing the rendering, and then we put it into the game,

692
00:43:30,111 --> 00:43:33,093
and we do that with all of the stuff around that,

693
00:43:33,233 --> 00:43:34,795
and at some point, it looks like this,

694
00:43:35,155 --> 00:43:38,617
which is pretty close to what it is going to be finally.

695
00:43:40,879 --> 00:43:47,820
I also go into the level and start adding all these objects manually, like bushes and trees that

696
00:43:49,321 --> 00:43:54,162
can behave dynamically and react to what you're doing, or they sway in the wind,

697
00:43:54,322 --> 00:44:00,603
so they're separate elements. And I also add a couple of smaller rocks and details like that.

698
00:44:01,543 --> 00:44:06,504
So this is the basic process of how we build and decorate our levels.

699
00:44:07,506 --> 00:44:09,247
But obviously doing a game for mobile,

700
00:44:09,287 --> 00:44:11,409
there are technical bottlenecks.

701
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:16,453
And these are the major three bottlenecks

702
00:44:16,573 --> 00:44:18,514
are fill rate, loading times, and file size.

703
00:44:19,015 --> 00:44:21,036
So fill rate basically is that you have

704
00:44:21,497 --> 00:44:24,439
a lot of transparent pixels on the screen.

705
00:44:24,719 --> 00:44:26,941
And the more transparent pixels you have on the screen

706
00:44:27,981 --> 00:44:30,523
overlapping each other, the more performance it will cost.

707
00:44:33,225 --> 00:44:40,832
we tried to tackle that by splitting the meshes

708
00:44:40,952 --> 00:44:42,934
into transparent and opaque parts.

709
00:44:43,695 --> 00:44:48,499
So we are using a plugin for Unity called SpriteSharp,

710
00:44:48,959 --> 00:44:49,960
which does that for us.

711
00:44:50,020 --> 00:44:52,743
It splits all the sprites in an opaque core

712
00:44:53,143 --> 00:44:53,643
and sort of a...

713
00:44:55,986 --> 00:44:57,288
an outline around that.

714
00:44:57,808 --> 00:44:59,810
And that is important because both of them

715
00:44:59,910 --> 00:45:03,273
are then added in the level as two separate game objects.

716
00:45:03,353 --> 00:45:05,575
And one is rendered with an opaque shader,

717
00:45:05,715 --> 00:45:07,536
and one is rendered with a transparent shader.

718
00:45:08,657 --> 00:45:10,759
So this basically looks like, for example,

719
00:45:10,979 --> 00:45:12,661
if you have something like a circle like this.

720
00:45:14,327 --> 00:45:16,908
In Unity, it will actually create a mesh

721
00:45:17,208 --> 00:45:20,130
that puts that texture on top that looks like this.

722
00:45:20,810 --> 00:45:26,133
And the opaque core in this case is this.

723
00:45:26,414 --> 00:45:29,575
So even if you have opaque pixels,

724
00:45:29,776 --> 00:45:31,617
but you render them with a shader

725
00:45:31,637 --> 00:45:35,239
that supports transparency, it will cost performance.

726
00:45:35,639 --> 00:45:37,860
So if you can render those with a different shader

727
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:38,941
that is an opaque shader,

728
00:45:39,601 --> 00:45:39,841
it will...

729
00:45:41,142 --> 00:45:43,464
be a significant change in performance.

730
00:45:43,764 --> 00:45:45,185
So we have this opaque core,

731
00:45:45,545 --> 00:45:47,147
and then we have the outline around it,

732
00:45:47,247 --> 00:45:48,788
and this part is the one that is rendered

733
00:45:49,108 --> 00:45:50,809
with transparency, with alpha.

734
00:45:51,410 --> 00:45:55,453
And this was, like, if you do it for all the sprites

735
00:45:55,493 --> 00:45:56,373
in a level, that was that.

736
00:45:56,734 --> 00:45:59,516
huge, huge, huge, huge performance increase.

737
00:45:59,536 --> 00:46:03,459
That was the main thing that pushed our FPS upwards.

738
00:46:03,579 --> 00:46:05,281
Also, one of the advantages that we have

739
00:46:05,341 --> 00:46:06,782
is we have a very slow game,

740
00:46:07,122 --> 00:46:10,145
so we can get away having 30 FPS in parts.

741
00:46:10,225 --> 00:46:12,467
You do not really need 60 FPS for a game

742
00:46:12,627 --> 00:46:16,610
about us old men walking slowly through the landscape.

743
00:46:16,930 --> 00:46:19,252
One of the things that I learned when doing that,

744
00:46:19,292 --> 00:46:21,254
when I was painting my Textures,

745
00:46:21,614 --> 00:46:23,396
that I often did things like this.

746
00:46:25,137 --> 00:46:27,480
It is not really good to see, so I did another shot of that,

747
00:46:27,560 --> 00:46:29,902
cranking up the levels. This actually looks like this.

748
00:46:29,922 --> 00:46:33,366
There are all these semi-transparent pixels somewhere.

749
00:46:36,329 --> 00:46:38,171
When you put that in Unity, you get this,

750
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:41,334
and that is obviously not good. When doing that,

751
00:46:41,394 --> 00:46:43,836
you have to make sure that the core actually is,

752
00:46:43,896 --> 00:46:46,239
like you can pull up with a circular marquee tool

753
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:48,121
and make that part actually opaque.

754
00:46:50,222 --> 00:46:53,783
Another problem is of course loading times.

755
00:46:54,023 --> 00:46:56,184
We have tons of textures, it's super asset heavy

756
00:46:56,884 --> 00:47:02,066
and we use sprite sheets like many other people as well.

757
00:47:02,126 --> 00:47:03,467
It's quite a common approach

758
00:47:03,747 --> 00:47:06,888
and we use level specific packing tags.

759
00:47:07,268 --> 00:47:09,169
So only those.

760
00:47:10,450 --> 00:47:11,990
Oh, there is nothing here. There you go.

761
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,911
Only those Textures are loaded in the Level

762
00:47:14,951 --> 00:47:15,951
that we actually need.

763
00:47:16,552 --> 00:47:18,692
And that generally works best with, like,

764
00:47:18,872 --> 00:47:20,233
small to medium-sized sprites,

765
00:47:21,173 --> 00:47:27,535
because the Atlas itself cannot be larger than 2048 by 2048.

766
00:47:28,275 --> 00:47:32,076
So we have sort of like Level-specific sprite Atlases,

767
00:47:32,556 --> 00:47:36,678
and sort of like the Atlas is used over multiple Levels.

768
00:47:38,718 --> 00:47:41,299
And finally, for the file size,

769
00:47:41,979 --> 00:47:45,520
what we do is to generate asset bundles for various devices.

770
00:47:45,560 --> 00:47:46,941
This works mainly on iOS,

771
00:47:47,441 --> 00:47:50,122
and it doesn't matter really for PC

772
00:47:50,142 --> 00:47:53,083
because if you have to download 1.5 gigs, that's all right,

773
00:47:53,423 --> 00:47:55,684
but if you have like a tiny iPhone, it's better

774
00:47:56,245 --> 00:47:58,005
if you have like a smaller app size, right?

775
00:47:58,445 --> 00:48:03,168
And so, the App Store has this feature called App Thinning.

776
00:48:03,688 --> 00:48:06,510
And so, we basically generate four different packages

777
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:09,151
with different base resolutions where all the other sprites

778
00:48:09,551 --> 00:48:12,153
are kind of scaled down toward a specific resolution,

779
00:48:12,593 --> 00:48:15,875
create these four packages, upload them to the store,

780
00:48:16,015 --> 00:48:18,936
and when you download the app,

781
00:48:19,577 --> 00:48:22,118
sort of Apple knows which device you use

782
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:23,959
and gives you the appropriate package.

783
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,601
So this is basically it.

784
00:48:28,221 --> 00:48:31,582
I hope this gave you a bit of an insight into our process

785
00:48:31,662 --> 00:48:35,043
and how it work and how also like building a box

786
00:48:35,103 --> 00:48:37,284
can sort of like help you find an art style

787
00:48:37,324 --> 00:48:38,064
and make decisions.

788
00:48:38,684 --> 00:48:43,666
But so a box is a great tool to help you do that.

789
00:48:44,406 --> 00:48:45,706
But it can't give you all the answers.

790
00:48:45,887 --> 00:48:48,607
So there's still a lot of manual labor

791
00:48:48,727 --> 00:48:52,269
and experimentation involved to find the right.

792
00:48:53,729 --> 00:48:58,651
solutions. So, also a box should kind of like always be a little bit flexible.

793
00:48:59,411 --> 00:49:05,454
A box art is like if your rules are too rigid, you kind of get unreceptive for natural growth

794
00:49:05,554 --> 00:49:10,536
and opportunities. So, for example, one of the rules is we have no text in the game, but we

795
00:49:10,576 --> 00:49:15,238
actually broke that rule a little bit because we have these bits and pieces of French flavor text

796
00:49:15,278 --> 00:49:18,339
that we're never going to translate. It's just on signs and things like that.

797
00:49:20,220 --> 00:49:24,164
So, and goals and constraints usually work best

798
00:49:24,204 --> 00:49:25,465
when they complement each other.

799
00:49:25,846 --> 00:49:29,629
So, constraints that contradict each other

800
00:49:29,689 --> 00:49:32,932
will stay contradictory up until the release of your game.

801
00:49:33,653 --> 00:49:36,756
For example, if you want to make a game about permadeath,

802
00:49:36,876 --> 00:49:39,659
but your sort of like constraint is maybe

803
00:49:40,079 --> 00:49:42,862
that you are going to do something about encouraging.

804
00:49:44,765 --> 00:49:50,580
playful curiosity, those two things might not mesh up together too well because every time

805
00:49:51,486 --> 00:49:55,408
players playfully and curiously do try something

806
00:49:55,768 --> 00:49:59,150
and they get a hammer over their head and die and have to restart again,

807
00:49:59,410 --> 00:50:00,791
they're not going to do that anymore.

808
00:50:01,451 --> 00:50:05,413
So, yeah, I think this is it. Thank you very much.

809
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:08,695
You can follow us on Twitter.

810
00:50:09,815 --> 00:50:14,378
I'm also available for questions later on in one of the wrap-up rooms.

811
00:50:14,818 --> 00:50:16,018
And, yeah, thanks for coming.

812
00:50:27,258 --> 00:50:28,178
So, any questions?

813
00:50:32,201 --> 00:50:32,661
No, good.

814
00:50:33,402 --> 00:50:35,223
Oh, I have one question.

815
00:50:35,383 --> 00:50:35,944
Oh, where?

816
00:50:36,164 --> 00:50:36,744
I'm over here.

817
00:50:37,164 --> 00:50:39,246
Oh, there you are, hi.

818
00:50:40,627 --> 00:50:44,109
The way you're using art and the kind of simplicity

819
00:50:44,149 --> 00:50:47,772
of the game mechanic reminds me a lot

820
00:50:47,892 --> 00:50:48,992
of other games that do that,

821
00:50:49,012 --> 00:50:51,854
that keep me into the game.

822
00:50:51,894 --> 00:50:53,115
The game mechanic seems to be there

823
00:50:53,455 --> 00:50:54,596
to keep me involved in the game.

824
00:50:55,497 --> 00:50:57,677
primarily to enjoy the beauty of the art style.

825
00:50:58,498 --> 00:51:01,598
It really becomes a work of art that can exist over time,

826
00:51:01,999 --> 00:51:04,739
and that time is expanded because of the game mechanic,

827
00:51:04,759 --> 00:51:05,540
and the art seems to be,

828
00:51:05,580 --> 00:51:07,720
and in this case, the emotional narrative,

829
00:51:07,960 --> 00:51:09,401
seems to be the primary goal.

830
00:51:09,721 --> 00:51:12,642
Which are things, actually, I personally love games like that.

831
00:51:13,202 --> 00:51:14,662
Is that something that you guys,

832
00:51:14,802 --> 00:51:17,443
is that something also that you see as primary goals,

833
00:51:17,483 --> 00:51:17,763
or is it?

834
00:51:18,304 --> 00:51:25,068
So the question is that if our primary goal was to create gameplay that would make one

835
00:51:25,108 --> 00:51:27,590
to spend people time in the game.

836
00:51:27,690 --> 00:51:31,073
That's right, your primary goal is to make a beautiful work of art that people spend

837
00:51:31,093 --> 00:51:34,075
time with, or your primary goal is to make a game?

838
00:51:34,195 --> 00:51:35,696
We wanted to make something in between.

839
00:51:38,098 --> 00:51:41,961
It definitely does have this experience first character to the game,

840
00:51:42,481 --> 00:51:46,665
and we wanted to make or have a game mechanic that would support that.

841
00:51:47,685 --> 00:51:52,609
But we always knew that the game mechanic around shaping hills

842
00:51:53,090 --> 00:51:56,592
would never give really enough depth as a game mechanic

843
00:51:56,652 --> 00:52:00,676
to create really brain-twisting, difficult puzzles.

844
00:52:01,356 --> 00:52:05,139
But we were confident, or we felt that it was...

845
00:52:06,152 --> 00:52:10,957
just good enough to keep players interested, but never frustrated.

846
00:52:11,278 --> 00:52:17,165
So that is sort of the idea of how we wanted to design the game mechanically, in a way.

847
00:52:17,485 --> 00:52:22,271
And yes, it is about experiencing the story and experiencing the world.

848
00:52:22,913 --> 00:52:25,734
The other thing I love about it is it seems like, in this case, the game mechanic itself

849
00:52:25,814 --> 00:52:28,896
also becomes a metaphor that really relates to the narrative itself.

850
00:52:28,936 --> 00:52:32,518
This idea of reshaping hills, reshaping, and the idea of how that relates to memory.

851
00:52:32,538 --> 00:52:35,399
That memory is a flexible thing that never is specific.

852
00:52:35,899 --> 00:52:37,200
We tried to do that.

853
00:52:39,601 --> 00:52:43,365
as much as possible without like enforcing it

854
00:52:43,525 --> 00:52:48,029
and that it feels starts to get like rigid or cramped

855
00:52:48,089 --> 00:52:49,491
or feel like forced in a way.

856
00:52:50,912 --> 00:52:52,734
But there is, for example, this one level

857
00:52:52,794 --> 00:52:55,376
where you have to move away hills

858
00:52:55,536 --> 00:52:57,638
and you dig deeper, deeper, deeper

859
00:52:57,698 --> 00:52:59,860
and he walks downward, downward, deeper, deeper, deeper

860
00:52:59,961 --> 00:53:01,542
until he finds that one memory.

861
00:53:01,862 --> 00:53:06,086
and that is sort of a metaphor

862
00:53:06,106 --> 00:53:09,489
that goes from the gameplay to the narrative.

863
00:53:09,930 --> 00:53:12,092
So these ideas definitely were something

864
00:53:12,112 --> 00:53:14,514
that we consciously chose.

865
00:53:14,854 --> 00:53:16,676
You remind me of stuff I love about Monument Valley

866
00:53:16,696 --> 00:53:17,176
and other games.

867
00:53:17,457 --> 00:53:19,238
Yes, yes, they're wonderful.

868
00:53:19,258 --> 00:53:19,919
Thanks for making time.

869
00:53:19,959 --> 00:53:21,420
They were a big inspiration, thanks.

870
00:53:21,460 --> 00:53:21,861
Yeah.

871
00:53:23,902 --> 00:53:26,685
All right, anybody else?

872
00:53:31,924 --> 00:53:33,045
Yeah, yes, please.

873
00:53:33,065 --> 00:53:36,708
I'm wondering if you have a deadline for settling down the R file,

874
00:53:36,728 --> 00:53:39,209
because I saw you jumping back and forth on who should be saving on their personal accounts,

875
00:53:39,229 --> 00:53:47,335
and who should be saving on their financial accounts.

876
00:53:53,581 --> 00:54:02,527
Yes, so the question is if we had a deadline in various stages of the production.

877
00:54:04,348 --> 00:54:09,432
Yes, we did, but we initially planned to only work 12 months on it.

878
00:54:10,072 --> 00:54:10,713
Now it is...

879
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:17,196
14 months and we're still going to take a little bit longer to finish it

880
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:20,597
But we are sort of within our time frame

881
00:54:21,017 --> 00:54:28,961
But our pre-production phase took a lot longer than we initially expected all this experimentation and and iteration

882
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:32,802
it took about five months and

883
00:54:34,203 --> 00:54:36,164
But that is all working full time on the game.

884
00:54:36,244 --> 00:54:38,306
So for example, building our box,

885
00:54:39,066 --> 00:54:40,887
I think that took like way longer,

886
00:54:40,927 --> 00:54:42,728
but that is something that needs calendar time.

887
00:54:42,888 --> 00:54:45,330
That is something that you think about on and off

888
00:54:45,470 --> 00:54:48,192
and sort of like have it in the back of your head

889
00:54:48,232 --> 00:54:49,752
and then sit down sometime again,

890
00:54:49,793 --> 00:54:52,554
talk about certain things or try to decide certain things.

891
00:54:52,974 --> 00:54:55,736
But that took like six months

892
00:54:55,836 --> 00:54:58,298
before we even started actually like working on the game.

893
00:54:58,338 --> 00:55:00,319
We were working on grant applications.

894
00:55:01,426 --> 00:55:03,087
budgeting and things like that.

895
00:55:04,528 --> 00:55:08,791
And so we do have deadlines and we do have an idea

896
00:55:08,851 --> 00:55:10,192
of how long things should take.

897
00:55:10,273 --> 00:55:13,695
And we also make plans about how long

898
00:55:13,715 --> 00:55:14,856
we want to spend on things.

899
00:55:15,377 --> 00:55:18,319
But there is a certain amount of flexibility,

900
00:55:18,719 --> 00:55:20,521
especially like in a smaller studio.

901
00:55:20,541 --> 00:55:24,304
We feel you need to be agile and things need to

902
00:55:24,784 --> 00:55:27,626
kind of like take their time to be able to sort of like,

903
00:55:28,447 --> 00:55:29,168
grow and

904
00:55:29,288 --> 00:55:35,113
kind of just sit there and develop themselves a little bit too.

905
00:55:36,815 --> 00:55:38,576
Does that somehow answer your question?

906
00:55:39,457 --> 00:55:39,737
Okay.

907
00:55:54,919 --> 00:56:01,944
How long it took us until we had that final thing where we decided this is how we were going to do it.

908
00:56:02,624 --> 00:56:07,407
So that for us was the pre-production phase that took about five months.

909
00:56:07,827 --> 00:56:14,291
But then there was a lot of the vocabulary and how we would translate it to all the other levels.

910
00:56:15,092 --> 00:56:20,035
that definitely was still took a while longer and is something that was also like sort of a little

911
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:26,099
bit of an ongoing process as we went along. Like by now everything is sort of like all the questions

912
00:56:26,159 --> 00:56:32,623
are pretty much answered and we really can just kind of like produce that thing and and draw the

913
00:56:32,663 --> 00:56:39,327
textures without having many questions anymore. So but yeah the initial phase was five months and

914
00:56:39,367 --> 00:56:43,710
then the rest was kind of like along went along as we worked on it.

915
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:46,521
You're welcome.

916
00:56:48,221 --> 00:56:51,743
All right. I think we're good to go.

917
00:56:51,883 --> 00:56:55,024
Yeah, you can just ask me afterwards somewhere down the hall

918
00:56:55,064 --> 00:56:56,905
if you have any questions. Come say hello.

919
00:56:57,466 --> 00:57:02,948
Oh, yeah, and you can also, of course, play the game at the IGF booth

920
00:57:03,448 --> 00:57:06,630
as well as at the Unity booth if you want to try it.

921
00:57:07,370 --> 00:57:09,011
So, yeah, thanks again for coming.
