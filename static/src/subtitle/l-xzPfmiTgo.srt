Hi, I'm Scott Peterson, Visual Effects Director at Zynga.

2
00:00:04,415 --> 00:00:07,397
At the GDC 2017, I'll be presenting a talk,

3
00:00:08,757 --> 00:00:11,659
Creating Effects Shaders Optimized for Mobile.

4
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:16,282
As a veteran effects supervisor from animation,

5
00:00:16,822 --> 00:00:19,764
I found that the constraints of mobile hardware,

6
00:00:20,784 --> 00:00:22,686
understanding those constraints has helped me

7
00:00:22,786 --> 00:00:26,548
transition skills from the animation industry into mobile.

8
00:00:28,027 --> 00:00:36,311
This talk focuses on both visual and technical choices that we made on FarmVille, Tropic Escape, to create water and clouds.

9
00:00:37,451 --> 00:00:47,035
The techniques discussed apply to a wide variety of effects, including a blend mode that is both bright and maintains color saturation.

10
00:00:48,436 --> 00:00:53,678
Also using erosion in conjunction with transparency to make more graphic splashes.

11
00:00:55,914 --> 00:00:58,736
using particles to enhance specular highlights,

12
00:01:00,677 --> 00:01:02,639
understanding the role of draw calls

13
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:04,500
and precision in performance.

14
00:01:06,441 --> 00:01:08,523
If you work with shaders or visual effects on mobile,

15
00:01:08,703 --> 00:01:09,643
please come to my talk.
