1
00:00:08,036 --> 00:00:09,557
So thank you very much for coming.

2
00:00:10,678 --> 00:00:13,279
Welcome to All Game Trailers Are Not Created Equal.

3
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:19,583
This talk is a publisher perspective on the game trailer creation.

4
00:00:19,823 --> 00:00:23,545
It's a dive into different trailers formulas and what they have to offer.

5
00:00:24,246 --> 00:00:28,708
It's a reflection on how to adapt your trailer depending on its canvas.

6
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:31,490
And it's not about how to produce your trailer.

7
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:34,592
You already have a lot of great resources on that end.

8
00:00:36,369 --> 00:00:42,267
So hi, I'm Adrien Marich and I've been working as brand manager at Dotemy for three years now.

9
00:00:43,593 --> 00:00:52,340
Dotemu is a French publishing company based in Paris that specializes in neo-retro experiences like Streets of Rage 4 and TMNT Shredder's Revenge.

10
00:00:53,841 --> 00:01:08,772
Before Dotemu, I worked as a part of the French publishing team at Rockstar Games and I have a background in the film industry, working on releases, strategies and marketing material like posters, trailers for various releases from Palme d'Or to Minions or the Fast and Furious franchise.

11
00:01:10,661 --> 00:01:15,485
I work on the marketing strategies for both Dotemu and the Arca Crew game releases.

12
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:27,214
With Dotemu, we work on titles that are based on a renowned IP, while the Arca Crew is our publishing label dedicated to original games, concepts, and properties.

13
00:01:28,155 --> 00:01:35,601
There, our lead asset is not the IP we are basing the title on, and we have to start everything from scratch like everybody else.

14
00:01:37,162 --> 00:01:41,145
With the same publishing team behind all projects, we do learn through each one together.

15
00:01:44,006 --> 00:01:49,610
And it's important to keep in mind how game trailers are so different and why it matters.

16
00:01:51,682 --> 00:01:52,022
Too quick.

17
00:01:52,903 --> 00:01:55,545
First, they have different production pipelines.

18
00:01:55,925 --> 00:01:58,827
For video games, you have an infinite time to create shots.

19
00:01:59,307 --> 00:02:01,169
It's easy to cheat or to do retakes.

20
00:02:02,129 --> 00:02:10,135
And game trailers can look nothing like the final product, as CGI or animated trailer can help build a mood or direction.

21
00:02:10,615 --> 00:02:18,020
And for AAA games, we know that this can create a gap between the intended vision and the way the game will be available for player day one.

22
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:20,122
I don't need to showcase any example here.

23
00:02:22,333 --> 00:02:34,559
And if you compare the way you announce films and games, you will see that film projects that are signed or entering production are mostly already announced through specialized outlets like Variety or The Hollywood Reporter.

24
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:40,042
You may have official or leaked videos or photos from the set, but that's mainly it.

25
00:02:43,421 --> 00:02:59,332
And finally, the video game culture and the game trailer culture are built on surprises, and the world premiere effect is pretty much unique in the entertainment industry, with showcases fully dedicated to trailers, announcements and gameplay.

26
00:03:00,873 --> 00:03:04,916
So what do I mean by all game trailers are not created equal?

27
00:03:06,405 --> 00:03:11,066
First, AAA game trailers have their own set of goals and tools.

28
00:03:11,786 --> 00:03:19,708
Announcing a AAA game, especially first party one, is announcing a showcase for game consoles in terms of graphics and more.

29
00:03:20,208 --> 00:03:26,750
It's a way to project into the future of a console's lineup with games that pushes the medium forward.

30
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:33,992
And this trailer can go around rules, around rhythm and build up with structures that are closer to film or television.

31
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:44,716
And on the indie side, most trailers are built with gameplay footage out of necessity and focuses on the gameplay loop, the art direction, and the world building.

32
00:03:45,616 --> 00:03:47,496
Immediacy is so important.

33
00:03:48,857 --> 00:03:54,699
With such a competitive field, this is where you must answer to the questions, how will you play this game?

34
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,340
And how does this game stand out from previous titles very quickly?

35
00:04:07,808 --> 00:04:11,430
Always keep in mind the goals of your trailers before you build it.

36
00:04:14,372 --> 00:04:22,076
Your trailer will help the player understand the game as you dive into gameplay and the game's universe, but it's also what welcome players to the store page.

37
00:04:23,376 --> 00:04:37,144
It's key to build a trailer as a visual support to an announcement too, as a trailer untied to additional information can create frustration and impatience from the audience that you are trying to build.

38
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:41,074
The main takeaway here is the timing.

39
00:04:41,675 --> 00:04:45,901
Ask yourself, why is this trailer relevant to this marketing beat?

40
00:04:46,322 --> 00:04:49,366
And what key information are included in this trailer?

41
00:04:51,149 --> 00:04:55,255
That's why you must build your trailer for each one of your marketing beats.

42
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:03,630
This is what a regular trailer campaign looks like for a game release, from announcement to launch and beyond.

43
00:05:05,011 --> 00:05:10,897
One marketing beat can obviously merge with another, but we'll take the time to analyze each one for this talk.

44
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,321
Announcement trailers, they're the most important one.

45
00:05:18,061 --> 00:05:20,661
Set the hook as fast as possible.

46
00:05:21,121 --> 00:05:25,682
Dive into the gameplay and the universe quickly, unless you're relying on a well-known IP.

47
00:05:25,962 --> 00:05:28,062
I'll come back to that a bit later.

48
00:05:29,783 --> 00:05:43,065
You must take into account that this may be the only video asset you'll be publishing for quite some time, especially if you happen to encounter delays into productions, which we kind of always all do.

49
00:05:45,154 --> 00:05:49,418
And finally, even if it's for a couple of shots, always have gameplay.

50
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:53,362
You need to help the player know how your game will be played.

51
00:05:54,543 --> 00:05:58,747
And as you'll be launching your Steam page at the same time, you'll need to have screenshots anyway.

52
00:06:01,823 --> 00:06:06,826
I wanted to showcase an example of one of our reveal trailers, here for Metal Slug Tactics.

53
00:06:08,007 --> 00:06:10,249
The opening seconds serve as a tease.

54
00:06:10,789 --> 00:06:15,192
We are announcing a collaboration between us and a new partner, being SNK.

55
00:06:15,753 --> 00:06:23,458
This also helps to celebrate and emphasize our global positioning as a go-to publisher for retro licenses.

56
00:06:24,956 --> 00:06:29,780
But the trailer features a short animated sequence and a quick switch to the gameplay.

57
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:38,567
This was needed in order to present the tactical twist we are working on on the Metal Slug license early to avoid any confusion.

58
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:40,688
This is not a mainline title.

59
00:06:41,149 --> 00:06:45,432
It's a new original spin-off, but the Metal Slug IP is in the right hands.

60
00:06:47,717 --> 00:06:55,866
This was done to a greater extent with Shredder's Revenge, as we created a new version of the 87 TV show opening with a full minute of animation.

61
00:06:56,567 --> 00:07:05,276
But we couldn't leave it with that, as we needed gameplay to emphasize on the legacy of the arcade titles we are basing the game on.

62
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:13,562
Another example I wanted to showcase is Vengeful Guardian Moon Rider.

63
00:07:14,322 --> 00:07:23,786
We used the first second of the trailer for world building, and to introduce the studio through its previous and successful release, which was Blazing Chrome, that was also published by the Arcade Crew.

64
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:35,670
We saw later that it may have been a mistake, as we saw that the most replayed moment of the trailer on YouTube was this, the switch from the opening cinematic to the gameplay.

65
00:07:36,250 --> 00:07:42,332
The interest for our core audience wasn't really in the cinematic or the world building, but gameplay, gameplay, gameplay.

66
00:07:44,684 --> 00:07:51,852
Speaking of gameplay, your next step is to create a gameplay trailer to offer a deep dive into what your game has to offer.

67
00:07:53,153 --> 00:07:55,015
These can be lengthy videos.

68
00:07:55,235 --> 00:07:59,540
Take your time to explain your gameplay loop and work especially on the structure.

69
00:08:00,421 --> 00:08:03,484
Create sections, chapters, everything is welcome here.

70
00:08:09,598 --> 00:08:15,099
The best way to be precise and guide the audience to where you want to lead them is through voiceover.

71
00:08:15,619 --> 00:08:18,400
This is especially efficient on systemic games.

72
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:26,621
When you're working on this, always have a first cut of your trailer with your own voice before you move forward with a voiceover artist.

73
00:08:27,182 --> 00:08:31,082
This is where you'll see all of the flows in your footage or in your script.

74
00:08:31,762 --> 00:08:34,163
Even if you cannot hear your own voice, it's for the best.

75
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,352
Fix this before you move forward with a pricey and time-consuming recording session with a voice-over artist.

76
00:08:43,033 --> 00:08:53,878
And finally, the gameplay trailers are especially efficient post-launch, as we see a great long trend for those especially with early access titles such as The Last Bell.

77
00:08:54,998 --> 00:09:06,917
Our gameplay overview trailer for The Last Pell doubled its number of views since we published it before our early access launch in 2021, and we observed spike views for each of our major update launches.

78
00:09:08,053 --> 00:09:09,373
We knew that the video worked.

79
00:09:09,854 --> 00:09:17,016
So with almost two years between the launch of the Early Access and the launch of the V1, we needed to update the video for Steam.

80
00:09:17,896 --> 00:09:22,417
We needed to make sure that every game mechanics and updated art are included.

81
00:09:22,898 --> 00:09:26,719
As for the V1 launch, the gameplay trailer must be one for the V1 game.

82
00:09:29,420 --> 00:09:30,080
Launch trailers.

83
00:09:31,368 --> 00:09:32,389
You're getting there, yes.

84
00:09:33,490 --> 00:09:41,356
This is the time where you reintroduce your game for the general audiences, as this will be the main trailer attached to your store page.

85
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:46,020
If this is the only trailer the audience will see, what must they see?

86
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:49,322
What can be put aside and what cannot?

87
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:54,810
If the player doesn't go down to the descriptions or the feature list, what will they see?

88
00:09:55,952 --> 00:09:59,437
And don't assume that everybody saw all of your previous trailer.

89
00:09:59,878 --> 00:10:04,906
This is where you can recycle and reuse all of the best bits of your previous trailer.

90
00:10:07,698 --> 00:10:15,405
If your games manage to have post-launch updates, it's very important to keep asking yourself, could this be a trailer?

91
00:10:16,326 --> 00:10:24,074
If you have a community, seize it and seize the opportunity to hype up what can be seen as minor content here.

92
00:10:25,270 --> 00:10:27,911
We learned that through our experience with Shredder's Revenge.

93
00:10:28,631 --> 00:10:36,295
As we were working on the main DLC, the team at Tribute Games worked on a minor content update in December of 2022.

94
00:10:37,475 --> 00:10:42,217
We announced the update through a press release and screenshots, but not with a trailer.

95
00:10:43,018 --> 00:10:51,922
And we gathered major press coverage following the game's main success a couple of months before, and we saw that we missed a big opportunity here.

96
00:10:53,142 --> 00:11:02,111
Early 2023, we learned from our mistake and created a dedicated trailer for a Street of Rage update, bringing general improvement and balancing.

97
00:11:02,752 --> 00:11:08,758
This ended up one of our most popular trailers for the title through our uploads on the IGN YouTube page.

98
00:11:17,030 --> 00:11:24,907
Multiple trailers that I showcased here include animation, and I would like to take some time to talk about this aspect of game trailers specifically.

99
00:11:26,758 --> 00:11:29,900
Going for animation in your trailers makes sense in a lot of ways.

100
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:36,144
This helps setting the scene and intentions from the project, clearly, like we did for TMNT or Windjammers 2 here.

101
00:11:37,124 --> 00:11:45,089
This format works better with major bits like announcement or launch, but it might make sense editorially for the game.

102
00:11:45,449 --> 00:11:48,992
Having 2D animation for a 3D game or vice versa doesn't work.

103
00:11:50,052 --> 00:11:51,473
The pros are quite obvious.

104
00:11:52,114 --> 00:12:02,681
It's an outstanding way to raise significantly the production value of your title and a great way to offer something different than gameplay if your title doesn't include in-game cutscenes.

105
00:12:03,481 --> 00:12:07,063
Keep in mind that the main obstacle for those is the price tag.

106
00:12:07,824 --> 00:12:12,147
Creating an animated trailer is pricey and can be very time-consuming.

107
00:12:13,309 --> 00:12:20,187
This can cost between $1,000 to $4,000 per second depending on the animation complexity and count month of work.

108
00:12:22,686 --> 00:12:31,050
We've also experienced deception regarding animated trailers, as players may end up upset about the disparity between animation style and the game's art direction.

109
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:48,897
This example here features part of the animated sequence for the Last Bell launch trailer, with the most liked comment we saw through an upload on the PlayStation YouTube page, praising the game OST, but pointing out the difference between the trailer and the gameplay art direction as misleading.

110
00:12:56,563 --> 00:13:02,946
Overall, we see how internally this animated trailer impacts performances in our trailer.

111
00:13:04,086 --> 00:13:16,411
These numbers are based on performances in our own YouTube channel for titles we publish through Dotemu, and our animated announcement trailer performances are almost three times better than the average trailer views we have for the rest of the campaign.

112
00:13:18,858 --> 00:13:24,826
One of the unanimated trailer that didn't follow this trend was the announcement trailer for Pharaoh A New Era.

113
00:13:25,647 --> 00:13:35,160
This trailer for the remake of the 1999 game doesn't feature any gameplay until the final fade to black at the end of a 1 minute and 40 second video.

114
00:13:36,565 --> 00:13:44,250
This trailer did less than half of the average trailer organic views we had for the rest of the campaign at 24k views and the average at 53.

115
00:13:44,710 --> 00:13:53,736
The IGN upload was way more successful and showed us that this right here was the most replayed moment of the trailer.

116
00:13:54,136 --> 00:13:58,159
The last seconds where we reveal one rendering of the remake.

117
00:14:01,161 --> 00:14:09,227
If we were making this trailer today, we definitely would have gone with an approach similar to Metal Sword Tactics, which is mixing animation and gameplay.

118
00:14:11,829 --> 00:14:20,455
Another example I wanted to showcase is the fantastic reveal trailer for Dead Cells from Evil Empire, introducing their collaboration with Castlevania.

119
00:14:21,877 --> 00:14:25,898
The collaboration isn't revealed until the second part of the trailer, but that's OK.

120
00:14:26,678 --> 00:14:34,300
Dead Cell is a very popular franchise by itself, and their team have a tradition of creating animated trailers to introduce the themes of their DLC.

121
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:40,221
And it's perfectly built for the way it premiered, which was at the Game Awards pre-show of 2022.

122
00:14:43,422 --> 00:14:47,383
And this is why trailers' canvas can change absolutely everything.

123
00:14:49,836 --> 00:14:53,997
Premiering your trailer as a showcase remains one of the best ways to do it.

124
00:14:54,897 --> 00:14:57,118
Showcases are the best format you can imagine.

125
00:14:57,558 --> 00:14:58,858
It's a show about trailers.

126
00:14:59,619 --> 00:15:03,640
People tuning in are here for the whole show, so you don't want to miss one more thing.

127
00:15:04,460 --> 00:15:11,282
And on the audience side, you get a combination of the live audience plus the post-show uploads.

128
00:15:11,842 --> 00:15:16,603
With this format, you can bury your lead, as the trailer you'll be creating will be shown in full too.

129
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:22,053
Bear in mind that showcases may obey to different rules as well, such as ratings.

130
00:15:22,593 --> 00:15:27,857
You may have to adapt your game footage for general audiences, but if Doom did it, you can too.

131
00:15:29,058 --> 00:15:36,163
Either way, it's important to flag this early into game production, so you are able to create safe gameplay early.

132
00:15:37,770 --> 00:15:47,536
And finally, showcases offer a lot of live reaction broadcasts from press and content creators, and they're a fantastic way to see if your trailer works.

133
00:15:48,136 --> 00:15:53,520
I discussed that with the Evil Empire team, and we did exactly the same thing, I think.

134
00:15:54,200 --> 00:16:06,167
which is log in the next morning and see all of the content creators that you like reacting to the trailer that you showcased the night before and see the joy in their faces.

135
00:16:06,407 --> 00:16:08,588
It's heartwarming stuff for the whole company.

136
00:16:13,505 --> 00:16:17,947
For our release date trailer on Shredder's Revenge, we needed to include three key elements.

137
00:16:18,508 --> 00:16:24,211
A new playable character, the six-player mode, and a release date, with the latter being the most important one.

138
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:32,615
Our campaign was ramping up, and we had very high expectations about finally delivering a release date after a year-long campaign.

139
00:16:34,487 --> 00:16:42,695
After locking a slot at the Summer Game Fest of 2022, we worked around expectations and buried the date as a one more thing at the end of our trailer.

140
00:16:43,475 --> 00:16:53,525
This was not an issue for the rest of the campaign outside the showcase as the release date was our leading information in our wording on social media and on press release.

141
00:16:54,748 --> 00:17:08,083
Having the release date this late in the trailer was clearly built for creating a genuine reaction for the live premiere of the trailer from the audience but also from content creators live streaming the event given that the date was just one week after the showcase itself.

142
00:17:10,664 --> 00:17:24,374
And while we worked on the announcement for the game's DLC the next year, we built the trailer as a TBC participant of a showcase, with the reveal of one of the new playable characters, Usagi, buried in the second half of the trailer.

143
00:17:25,375 --> 00:17:33,941
The trailer was ultimately not picked up for a showcase slot, and so its structure was not as effective with an organic reveal through our social media.

144
00:17:34,842 --> 00:17:46,530
The Usagi reveal here scene was storyboarded as a surprise on the second half of the trailer, but with your social copy and your press leading with the character, the wow effect doesn't work as effectively as intended.

145
00:17:47,570 --> 00:17:56,616
If this trailer was created without a showcase in mind from the get-go, I would have opened it with Usagi differently and storyboarded the whole thing completely differently.

146
00:17:58,825 --> 00:18:08,494
And to wrap up on showcases, maybe a trailer is not the best thing you can provide, especially on non-first-party showcases where the audience is more likely to switch off.

147
00:18:09,434 --> 00:18:17,121
B-roll or unedited gameplay can be efficient if your hook is easier to understand in-game, and especially if you're limited on time.

148
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:21,405
And adding dev commentary on top of this is extremely efficient too.

149
00:18:23,865 --> 00:18:27,929
Regarding Steam, it remains the best platform for your trailer today.

150
00:18:28,329 --> 00:18:35,556
It's the quickest to show your trailer, as first-party stores require way more input from the player to access videos.

151
00:18:36,457 --> 00:18:39,360
This is where you must think about your first second the most.

152
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:44,544
What are you able to hook the player with your trailer opening seconds and without sound?

153
00:18:45,745 --> 00:18:49,726
And don't waste any precious time on secondary information.

154
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:53,948
Pluisher and Studio logos are not a hook here, especially.

155
00:18:54,788 --> 00:19:05,712
And if the ESRB logo can be overlaid on the lower side of the screen for 4 seconds instead of taking 2 full seconds full screen, do it.

156
00:19:05,932 --> 00:19:10,253
And don't hesitate to update your Steam trailers to optimize this too.

157
00:19:13,349 --> 00:19:17,354
One of my favorite Steam trailers in recent memories is the one for Pizza Tower.

158
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:20,418
The build-up is great, even without sound.

159
00:19:20,818 --> 00:19:24,363
Sure, you see the studio logo, but you have immediate gameplay in the background.

160
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:25,524
You are hooked no matter what.

161
00:19:26,385 --> 00:19:31,171
And it's impossible to resist a title card that says, Tour de Pizza presents Pizza Tower.

162
00:19:34,264 --> 00:19:37,448
The latest launch trailer from Vampire Survivors is incredible too.

163
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:41,854
They opened with the huge number of positive reviews the game got.

164
00:19:42,295 --> 00:19:46,260
It's a great way to emphasize on the worldwide sensation that the game is.

165
00:19:47,181 --> 00:19:51,267
With a stat that players understand, while adding the be the bullet hell tagline.

166
00:19:52,472 --> 00:19:58,796
You get to see within seconds the gameplay loop with medium and powerful build, a game over screen and character selection screen.

167
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:02,718
It's immediate, it translates the game's energy quickly.

168
00:20:03,518 --> 00:20:04,239
Incredible stuff.

169
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:10,022
Finally, I wanted to finish the talk with additional tips.

170
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:14,202
create a documentation process.

171
00:20:15,283 --> 00:20:19,747
It's important to document everything that you find in your game that could be useful later.

172
00:20:20,387 --> 00:20:24,331
It is a time-consuming process, but it's much easier to create assets with it.

173
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:29,456
Documenting works for every game, whether they are IP-based or not.

174
00:20:30,277 --> 00:20:35,942
From design documents, working progress art, or animation to final workflow, we can use everything.

175
00:20:37,211 --> 00:20:48,060
With this base, it's much easier to list everything that you have included so far in your trailer campaign, character, level, actions, and ask yourself, what have you already included?

176
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:50,822
How can we avoid repeating too many things?

177
00:20:53,184 --> 00:20:59,909
This document is useful for everyone and can be exploited later by the PR, communication, and social media teams.

178
00:21:07,113 --> 00:21:11,316
This is an excerpt of the documentation we made for Moon Rider's release campaign.

179
00:21:11,857 --> 00:21:16,240
It features a list of levels, weapons, items, enemies, secrets and more.

180
00:21:17,901 --> 00:21:33,353
We worked with this document with our mighty QA team as the game was often updated and this document helped both our additional process on the marketing side and then later all of the reviewers of the game so they won't miss a single thing.

181
00:21:35,922 --> 00:21:49,852
I'm not proud of how this one looks, but for the Shadows Livens DLC, we built a four-trailer campaign with different elements scattered among the announcement, like new characters and color palettes based on the rich history of TMNT.

182
00:21:50,673 --> 00:22:04,143
To leave room with suspense while we sprinkle as many Easter eggs as possible in our material, it was important to document who and which version of the characters were showcased in which trailer.

183
00:22:04,883 --> 00:22:13,326
The same document was created for levels and power-ups from the DLC, so it would be editorially pitch-perfect, but believe me, this is the good-looking one.

184
00:22:14,886 --> 00:22:16,987
These documents were kept up-to-date for everyone.

185
00:22:17,227 --> 00:22:25,150
Each marketing beat got new content to enjoy, while we made sure that, in the end, we didn't spoil everything that was included in the DLC.

186
00:22:27,957 --> 00:22:35,140
I cannot overstate how important it is for developers to share their game captures to publishing teams.

187
00:22:37,161 --> 00:22:39,302
Even non-final footage is useful.

188
00:22:39,722 --> 00:22:46,745
It helps us and your team understand the goals and the intended gameplay flow of the projects as soon as possible.

189
00:22:47,325 --> 00:22:51,587
And if you identify great elements from the game during production, share the goods.

190
00:22:53,085 --> 00:22:58,138
plus sharing helps making sure that your team won't have to do the same game capture twice or more.

191
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:00,384
I talk from experience on that end.

192
00:23:03,598 --> 00:23:07,660
To finally present your gameplay to the world, wait until it's great.

193
00:23:08,541 --> 00:23:16,825
You know you only get one chance to make great first impressions, so make sure you're only using exactly what's on par with your intention and your vision.

194
00:23:17,905 --> 00:23:25,649
Keep in mind that if the gameplay loop isn't clear to the person doing the editing, it will most certainly be for the person watching the trailer after.

195
00:23:27,050 --> 00:23:32,633
You may have to wait until undercooked gameplay gets better to expose it, but it's always for the best.

196
00:23:35,887 --> 00:23:44,921
Showcasing a killer shot in a trailer and reusing in your marketing material is very common in films, with the Mission Impossible franchise being the best at it in my opinion.

197
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:57,690
Making this a part of your game identity through screenshots, GIFs, clips or any social media assets is a very efficient way to make it a part of the game identity, make it memorable.

198
00:23:58,411 --> 00:24:12,463
An example that I can give on the video game side is how influential the first paraglider shot from the first trailer of Zelda Breath of the Wild was and how it built the visual strategy for all of the rest of the campaign.

199
00:24:15,451 --> 00:24:17,032
I love trailers for VR games.

200
00:24:17,973 --> 00:24:24,837
They are usually my favorite part of showcases because their ability to go on point is so, so quick.

201
00:24:25,417 --> 00:24:32,501
And because the way they are built, they focus the energy on gameplay and how the player will interact with the world around them.

202
00:24:33,082 --> 00:24:40,246
They need to open quickly on gameplay too, as they need to be identified as VR titles immediately to avoid any confusion.

203
00:24:40,946 --> 00:24:43,428
We have a lot of things to learn from VR games.

204
00:24:45,780 --> 00:24:50,022
And finally, never underestimate the key art as a part of your trailer.

205
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:52,804
It remains the final shot of your trailer.

206
00:24:53,424 --> 00:25:01,168
If your key art happens to be too crowded to include dates and platform information, add a dedicated second shot so everything can be seen clearly.

207
00:25:02,429 --> 00:25:07,131
Key arts must feel like the extension of the trailer's storytelling.

208
00:25:07,332 --> 00:25:15,496
And don't forget that this remains the first visual asset that players will be seeing in stores.

209
00:25:17,488 --> 00:25:24,676
Please find through this QR code a document that compiles all of the resources and trailers that I use for this talk.

210
00:25:25,036 --> 00:25:30,843
I want to give a big thank you to all of the studios and external developers for letting me showcase their wonderful talk here.

211
00:25:31,604 --> 00:25:34,206
And we have five minutes for questions.

212
00:25:34,767 --> 00:25:35,328
Thank you very much.

213
00:25:52,535 --> 00:25:56,316
If we do alternate, sorry?

214
00:26:13,398 --> 00:26:14,639
Yeah.

215
00:26:14,699 --> 00:26:21,501
Do we do alternative cuts of trailers for social media to make sure that we respect all of the rules?

216
00:26:22,042 --> 00:26:22,202
Yes.

217
00:26:23,062 --> 00:26:34,827
Basically, that's the most important thing, especially on social media that works best with shorter versions.

218
00:26:35,467 --> 00:26:37,148
And yeah, that's pretty common in what we do.

219
00:26:42,228 --> 00:26:42,989
Thanks for the talk.

220
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:47,111
You mentioned, like, always show gameplay in the announcement trailer, right?

221
00:26:47,591 --> 00:26:50,032
And there's another gameplay trailer, right?

222
00:26:50,052 --> 00:26:55,335
Do you guys ever show, like, the same gameplay feature, like, multiple times in different trailers?

223
00:26:55,740 --> 00:27:11,713
Yeah, we tend to do it because that's mostly about we want to make sure that we need to remember that as a marketing campaign we've been working on this game for months, for years, but the people that will be watching the trailers

224
00:27:12,874 --> 00:27:16,497
this will maybe be the first time ever that they see the trailer for this game.

225
00:27:17,138 --> 00:27:26,525
So for the announcement trailer, we do have the... now after we announce it, we see which part of the trailer performed well.

226
00:27:27,206 --> 00:27:31,129
And so we reused these kind of things to make sure that this is efficient.

227
00:27:31,569 --> 00:27:34,832
An example that I can give is the announcement trailer of TMNT.

228
00:27:35,592 --> 00:27:48,116
One of the highlights for the core community was to see that the four different turtles had four different running animations, which is different from the Konami arcade games.

229
00:27:48,556 --> 00:28:01,541
So we knew that this was something that works extremely well, and so we made sure that for every next trailer we had the turtles running, because this is a part of their identity, and the core audience wanted to make sure that

230
00:28:02,521 --> 00:28:06,503
we felt the personality of each character while we played.

231
00:28:07,063 --> 00:28:12,145
So this is one of the biggest elements that we make sure that we included for each trailer.

232
00:28:12,645 --> 00:28:12,885
Thanks.

233
00:28:13,545 --> 00:28:13,766
Of course.

234
00:28:16,927 --> 00:28:17,207
OK.

235
00:28:17,767 --> 00:28:21,749
Well, I'll be at the wrap-up area right next door.

236
00:28:22,049 --> 00:28:24,730
And thank you once again, everybody, for listening.
