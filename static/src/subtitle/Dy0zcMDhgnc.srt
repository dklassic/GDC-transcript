00:00:00,168 --> 00:00:12,013
Good afternoon everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel. My name is Brian Francis, I am normally the invisible voice inside your head, but today I am the very visible voice inside your head and in front of your screen.

2
00:00:12,733 --> 00:00:18,616
We, it's been a minute since we've been streaming, and we're back today with Command & Conquer, the remastered collection.

3
00:00:19,596 --> 00:00:26,138
And with me, in the lower left hand corner of the screen, is my new friend, Jim Vasella. Jim, how's it going?

4
00:00:27,018 --> 00:00:28,958
Hello, it's going great, thanks for having me.

5
00:00:29,018 --> 00:00:31,259
Awesome, yeah, we're super happy to have you.

6
00:00:31,319 --> 00:00:33,279
So, a couple things for the audience.

7
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,260
We're going to be having a chat with Jim

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,040
for about 30-40 minutes.

9
00:00:37,060 --> 00:00:39,641
Unfortunately, the gameplay is pre-recorded,

10
00:00:39,661 --> 00:00:41,321
so if you're going to make fun of how I'm playing,

11
00:00:41,401 --> 00:00:42,802
guess what, too bad, I can't fix it.

12
00:00:43,662 --> 00:00:44,922
Also, second confession,

13
00:00:45,222 --> 00:00:46,403
didn't play the original

14
00:00:47,923 --> 00:00:49,003
Command & Conquer, because

15
00:00:49,183 --> 00:00:50,764
I was 6 or 7 when it came out,

16
00:00:51,244 --> 00:00:52,824
so this was all new to me.

17
00:00:52,884 --> 00:00:54,365
The concept of having no right click.

18
00:00:54,845 --> 00:00:55,785
It was very scary.

19
00:00:56,985 --> 00:00:59,586
With that in mind, we're going to get started.

20
00:00:59,666 --> 00:01:03,948
As you can see, we're playing the first missions of the campaign, of the Good Guys campaign.

21
00:01:03,968 --> 00:01:06,729
Although some people will just be Good Guys because they love Kane.

22
00:01:07,129 --> 00:01:12,011
But Jim, would you mind introducing yourself and the work you did on Command & Conquer Remastered Collection?

23
00:01:13,158 --> 00:01:18,281
Sure. Yeah, so I'm Jim Vasella. I am a lead producer at Electronic Arts.

24
00:01:19,182 --> 00:01:25,226
And I was the producer on the game, working with Petroglyph and Lemon Sky Studios

25
00:01:25,646 --> 00:01:27,608
to create it over the past 18 months.

26
00:01:28,408 --> 00:01:33,672
And I've been kind of the core person at EA, interfacing with all of our teams there,

27
00:01:33,712 --> 00:01:36,654
like QA and localization, to make the game happen.

28
00:01:36,734 --> 00:01:42,158
And working really close with Petroglyph on all of the design choices and art direction

29
00:01:42,178 --> 00:01:42,558
and stuff like that.

30
00:01:42,918 --> 00:01:43,699
and everything like that.

31
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:49,642
Yeah, I just want to say I'm super impressed with this remastered product.

32
00:01:49,662 --> 00:01:52,163
This isn't the first remastered we've featured on stream.

33
00:01:52,503 --> 00:01:56,645
If you dig through our archives, you'll find a chat we did with the folks from the Age

34
00:01:56,665 --> 00:01:59,366
of Empires remastered team who did some incredible work on that game.

35
00:02:00,047 --> 00:02:05,669
It's really cool to see 90s strategy games getting this remastering push from companies

36
00:02:05,689 --> 00:02:06,190
like EA.

37
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:09,771
So I bet all the fans in chat are happy that you did this.

38
00:02:10,442 --> 00:02:13,606
Um, and just to someone who's new to the, new to this whole world of Command & Conquer,

39
00:02:14,087 --> 00:02:17,611
this was fun. This was a blast from the past 90s. Look at this, look at this full motion video

40
00:02:17,991 --> 00:02:19,573
that somehow still looks beautiful.

41
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:26,882
On a 1920 by 1080 monitor. So that, that gives us the opportunity to springboard into my first

42
00:02:26,922 --> 00:02:27,843
question, which is, um.

43
00:02:29,024 --> 00:02:34,326
As a producer, how did EA see the process for remastering a game like Command & Conquer,

44
00:02:34,346 --> 00:02:36,928
which was obviously developed under one set of development parameters,

45
00:02:37,328 --> 00:02:42,630
and now has to function on machines that are much better, able to do higher definition graphics,

46
00:02:42,711 --> 00:02:47,293
even just a higher resolution, that alone changes how the game looks, how the game feels.

47
00:02:48,053 --> 00:02:52,455
So would you mind walking through the basics of that remastering process from that angle?

48
00:02:54,434 --> 00:02:59,836
EA gave us actually a lot of autonomy in terms of how we wanted to creatively approach the game.

49
00:03:00,136 --> 00:03:07,159
And the first step of that was reaching out to Petroglyph and hoping that they wanted us to sign on board.

50
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:10,860
And luckily they were very excited to jump back into Command & Conquer with us.

51
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:17,362
And then working with LemonSky who had had prior experience doing remasters like this.

52
00:03:18,002 --> 00:03:21,303
And so they were pretty familiar with the process of how to do it.

53
00:03:22,364 --> 00:03:28,868
Some of the challenges they'd encountered before, and then other cool tricks that they'd learned along the way.

54
00:03:28,928 --> 00:03:39,794
And so, we kind of brought those teams together, and then one of the unique things about this game is that we announced it before we even really started development at all, back in November of 2018.

55
00:03:41,961 --> 00:03:47,123
We were already getting feedback from the community before we even started pre-production.

56
00:03:47,223 --> 00:03:52,185
So they were super helpful in terms of guiding us in terms of how they wanted to see the

57
00:03:52,225 --> 00:03:53,065
game remastered.

58
00:03:53,825 --> 00:04:00,208
That led to a lot of our bigger creative decisions about what to update, what to change, what

59
00:04:00,228 --> 00:04:03,309
to keep really authentic and core to the originals.

60
00:04:04,089 --> 00:04:07,991
And we've had this kind of back and forth collaboration with the community throughout

61
00:04:08,031 --> 00:04:08,991
the entire development.

62
00:04:10,711 --> 00:04:13,872
It was a really great process to go through that.

63
00:04:13,912 --> 00:04:19,814
We were inspired by some of the Age of Empires remasters, by the StarCraft remasters,

64
00:04:19,834 --> 00:04:25,335
some of the other games that have gone down this road already over the past 6-7 years.

65
00:04:26,236 --> 00:04:31,437
We're happy that Command & Conquer can help get RTS back on the map in that way.

66
00:04:50,304 --> 00:05:12,201
And there they are.

67
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:29,425
Yeah, well actually it's a funny story there. We actually did not have the code.

68
00:05:31,327 --> 00:05:36,853
Yeah, when we started the game, we did not have any of the source code from some of the old Westwood properties.

69
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:42,178
Fortunately, through working with Petroglyph and some of their archives...

70
00:05:42,878 --> 00:05:45,359
We were able to actually recover the old source code.

71
00:05:45,379 --> 00:05:49,982
And that opened up our very first big creative question, which is,

72
00:05:50,282 --> 00:05:54,964
do we stick with remastering the game in a very authentic way,

73
00:05:55,124 --> 00:05:59,967
using the old source code to keep that logic and the feel and the movement and the pacing

74
00:06:00,067 --> 00:06:01,808
exactly the same as the original?

75
00:06:02,908 --> 00:06:06,530
Or do we want to remake the game in an entirely different aspect?

76
00:06:07,791 --> 00:06:12,115
Through chatting with the different development teams and then bouncing some stuff off the community,

77
00:06:14,057 --> 00:06:17,440
we felt it was best to kind of stick to the authenticity of the original games.

78
00:06:18,701 --> 00:06:28,310
It's such a special kind of historical piece of gaming for the RTS genre that we wanted to make sure that we could recapture that same feel.

79
00:06:29,632 --> 00:06:36,895
But then the other element was, well, you know, what is too archaic and what should we really update to make better?

80
00:06:37,095 --> 00:06:44,317
And so the community was unanimous in that they wanted us to, you know, for instance, update the UI.

81
00:06:44,417 --> 00:06:49,498
And the C bar UI is something that we did a complete overhaul of from a design and implementation standpoint.

82
00:06:49,518 --> 00:06:51,279
And we think that's definitely for the better.

83
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:57,045
Multiplayer is something that doesn't even work anymore in the formal games.

84
00:06:57,626 --> 00:07:01,910
It used to work on Westwood Online, the system from the 90s, over modems.

85
00:07:02,451 --> 00:07:07,436
And so that was a piece of the game where we just rebuilt that entirely from scratch

86
00:07:07,496 --> 00:07:11,701
and added some new features there like replays and observer mode.

87
00:07:12,161 --> 00:07:13,622
Quick match and a leaderboard.

88
00:07:14,162 --> 00:07:20,025
So it was kind of this idea of keeping the core gameplay really authentic to the originals,

89
00:07:20,065 --> 00:07:26,148
but then wrapping it with a lot of these updates using some of Petroglyph's proprietary tech

90
00:07:26,808 --> 00:07:29,170
and trying to kind of approach the remaster that way.

91
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:33,192
But yeah, in those early weeks, it's really about thinking about those kind of creative pillars

92
00:07:33,272 --> 00:07:35,853
and what are the core things we wanted to keep the same

93
00:07:35,893 --> 00:07:38,935
and what are the things that we wanted to see really updated.

94
00:07:39,567 --> 00:07:44,171
Right on. Thank you for the folks in chat for helping me with my sound

95
00:07:44,191 --> 00:07:48,013
troubles. My microphone got unplugged, which is the most basic sound trouble

96
00:07:48,053 --> 00:07:49,514
you can have in a situation like this.

97
00:07:51,432 --> 00:07:57,217
Also, I will move on to my next question, which is can you walk through this is always one of my favorite ones

98
00:07:57,397 --> 00:08:04,343
Um, I actually really love how the classic sprites look in the video that we're watching here. You'll see a couple times where I

99
00:08:05,064 --> 00:08:07,646
Chose to turn on the new high-definition graphics

100
00:08:07,686 --> 00:08:10,889
But I kept switching back to these because I just loved the look it just like

101
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,751
It's funny, like to me as a newcomer, it clashed a little bit with the vibe of the game, but at the same time I'm like,

102
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:20,632
oh man, I like this, you know, I would love to play a game like this on my Switch, kind of,

103
00:08:20,712 --> 00:08:27,534
is what I feel like, this aesthetic is so good. But these sprites obviously were made for,

104
00:08:27,874 --> 00:08:32,455
like I mentioned before, a much smaller monitor than what I played on right now,

105
00:08:32,536 --> 00:08:35,856
so can you walk through the process of both like making the new high-definition graphics

106
00:08:36,357 --> 00:08:38,417
and the making these classic ones work as well?

107
00:08:39,501 --> 00:08:44,983
Yeah, and that was one of the best features that we could unlock by using the old source code,

108
00:08:45,003 --> 00:08:47,344
was the idea of this real-time graphic switching,

109
00:08:47,824 --> 00:08:52,226
which you can activate by pressing the spacebar when you're playing in kind of single-player.

110
00:08:52,246 --> 00:08:56,728
And it's just been a blast to see people, you know, turn it on and off,

111
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,049
and people who had forgotten what the old games looked like,

112
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:06,252
and then being really surprised at what we used to play with back when the original DOS version came out at a 320x200.

113
00:09:08,653 --> 00:09:14,216
resolution on what many people back then probably had, you know, a 15-inch CRT or something.

114
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:21,060
But the process to remastering the graphics was actually very similar to making a modern game.

115
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:26,323
So Lemon Sky actually reconcepted every single asset in the game.

116
00:09:26,383 --> 00:09:32,247
So they'd go back to the hand-drawn sketches, trying to be inspired by what you'd see in the actual game,

117
00:09:32,327 --> 00:09:34,348
what you would see in the cinematics if possible.

118
00:09:34,969 --> 00:09:37,452
You know, there were some renders from back in the day in the manuals.

119
00:09:38,013 --> 00:09:43,941
So, you know, we tried to take in elements of all those pieces to kind of re-concept what it would look like in kind of high definition.

120
00:09:45,139 --> 00:09:49,480
They would then go through the modeling process and then the texturing process,

121
00:09:49,520 --> 00:09:54,061
and eventually we would get to a really nice 3D model of every asset in the game.

122
00:09:54,721 --> 00:09:57,302
But then we put it through kind of the special rendering pipe,

123
00:09:57,442 --> 00:10:00,362
which would export it in the 2D sprites.

124
00:10:00,502 --> 00:10:03,943
So you'd have usually, you know, 32 angles for all the vehicles,

125
00:10:04,083 --> 00:10:07,184
or eight different angles for something like the infantry.

126
00:10:07,204 --> 00:10:11,325
And then it would, but it would also be with the animators, you know,

127
00:10:11,365 --> 00:10:11,885
and if there were...

128
00:10:12,385 --> 00:10:16,207
You know, 650 frames of animation on, say, like a Grenadier or something,

129
00:10:16,247 --> 00:10:20,850
they'd have to, you know, reanimate and export that in every single frame

130
00:10:20,930 --> 00:10:23,752
to match one-to-one to enable that real-time switching.

131
00:10:24,352 --> 00:10:28,055
So, the process was actually pretty similar to a modern game,

132
00:10:28,095 --> 00:10:32,858
but it was kind of that final step where we had to kind of take it into the sprite world.

133
00:10:33,018 --> 00:10:36,340
And then, once you get it in-game, you might realize that,

134
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,701
you know, what you thought looked really good in the 3D setting

135
00:10:40,377 --> 00:10:43,680
just didn't really match with what was in-game or what was in the legacy.

136
00:10:43,740 --> 00:10:48,665
So then we'd have to go through several kind of polish iterations and get really deep in there.

137
00:10:48,685 --> 00:10:51,928
And you'd be, you know, zoomed in and doing the back and forth and saying,

138
00:10:52,128 --> 00:10:55,332
oh, you know, the angle of that engine just isn't exactly right.

139
00:10:55,372 --> 00:10:56,293
We need to update that.

140
00:10:56,353 --> 00:11:04,681
And so we'd have to make a lot of kind of hand-adjusted differences on the sprites to make them look just perfect.

141
00:11:05,283 --> 00:11:11,068
I, um, you're going to see later on in my pre-recorded video that there was a point where I did a,

142
00:11:11,108 --> 00:11:13,870
like, you can see kind of a double-tick I did where there's kind of an asset that's

143
00:11:13,991 --> 00:11:18,795
floating, um, uh, it's sitting on the left side of the map.

144
00:11:18,855 --> 00:11:21,257
It's off the playable area, but I'm like, wait, what is that?

145
00:11:21,277 --> 00:11:24,460
And I pop between the classic and the normal to try to identify, and it looks like a downed

146
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,060
helicopter.

147
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:28,703
When I look at the original asset, I'm like, oh man, like how did anyone know what this

148
00:11:28,743 --> 00:11:29,804
was back in the day?

149
00:11:30,505 --> 00:11:37,451
There's a great story behind that. It's been kind of a conspiracy theory within the community for the past 20 years.

150
00:11:39,473 --> 00:11:47,020
To my knowledge, it was originally created and it looks kind of like a UFO or something like that.

151
00:11:47,620 --> 00:11:50,042
And then a few years later, Westwood...

152
00:11:50,603 --> 00:11:54,845
They kind of confirmed it was supposed to be a downed helicopter, but no one really believed them.

153
00:11:54,966 --> 00:12:02,290
And we kind of went with that approach, that it would just kind of make more sense to be kind of the downed cockpit.

154
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:08,094
But there's already been some mods actually made that you can find on the Steam Workshop of people

155
00:12:08,934 --> 00:12:13,757
remaking that particular asset as a more UFO-looking thing, perhaps to...

156
00:12:14,258 --> 00:12:18,866
The hint at the screen or something from the other sequels in the Tiberium universe.

157
00:12:18,906 --> 00:12:23,393
So it's just really fun to have the community kind of banter about that and debate what it

158
00:12:23,453 --> 00:12:28,061
actually should be and great to see them already contributing their own creative take on it.

159
00:12:28,340 --> 00:12:40,334
This kind of speaks to what the port does effectively, that I sort of stumbled into an old conspiracy theory about that, just by looking at that.

160
00:12:40,374 --> 00:12:48,023
And I think the only reason I paid attention to it was I was, at some point, I'd done a brief news story on Gamasutra, our sister site.

161
00:12:49,644 --> 00:12:54,728
Where they were talking about the StarCraft remaster and how sometimes they were looking at the at the sprites the old

162
00:12:55,128 --> 00:12:58,751
Zergs and we're wondering like wait, what is that? Is that supposed to be a tentacle a claw like?

163
00:12:59,711 --> 00:13:01,072
It was something I actually we're about to see it

164
00:13:01,092 --> 00:13:06,216
It's coming up on the left right here once once I expand the field of view here more or the fog of war not field of

165
00:13:06,236 --> 00:13:06,396
view

166
00:13:08,057 --> 00:13:13,762
But yeah, that's I'm just it's the the fact that the remaster can just sort of kick off that old

167
00:13:14,523 --> 00:13:18,698
debate to a new player at the drop of a hat. I'm super impressed by that.

168
00:13:19,744 --> 00:13:28,208
Let's go to chat because we started talking about mods and chat is talking about mods and has a lot of questions about the future of Command & Conquer and EA.

169
00:13:28,408 --> 00:13:33,070
Like I've mentioned before, this is a dev-focused stream, so we're going to tweak everything for kind of a dev-focus.

170
00:13:33,850 --> 00:13:37,731
But we also want to give you guys some credit. You're the Command & Conquer fans. We want to share your voice.

171
00:13:38,732 --> 00:13:42,373
LightBelgium would want to know, will we see mod support for multiplayer?

172
00:13:42,433 --> 00:13:48,496
And I guess I'm just kind of curious, how would that fit in with your approach for supporting mods with this?

173
00:13:49,077 --> 00:13:49,803
Remaster collection.

174
00:13:50,957 --> 00:13:58,441
Yeah, the one challenge with getting mods in our formal multiplayer is that the game runs on dedicated servers.

175
00:13:58,982 --> 00:14:07,747
And so the servers don't really know about mods that would be installed locally on each player's different computers.

176
00:14:07,807 --> 00:14:11,970
So it's a little difficult to get the mods to work in online multiplayer.

177
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:19,154
But something that we are looking at right now, which I've talked about in some of our community posts, is the concept of LAN play.

178
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:24,236
And that that's something that we want to get into our post-launch efforts here.

179
00:14:24,856 --> 00:14:27,017
And Land Play would be able to support mods.

180
00:14:28,477 --> 00:14:30,718
And I know that the community has been talking,

181
00:14:30,738 --> 00:14:33,278
there's some good tricks they can do with VPN and stuff

182
00:14:33,358 --> 00:14:36,899
to get Land to work a little bit broader.

183
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:41,421
And so we're hoping that Land Play can be a potential outlet

184
00:14:42,121 --> 00:14:44,742
for getting mods to work in multiplayer.

185
00:14:45,022 --> 00:14:47,102
But we're constantly taking in that feedback

186
00:14:47,162 --> 00:14:48,483
and seeing what the players want to see.

187
00:14:49,030 --> 00:14:54,912
Oh, that's kind of cool, actually. And I believe Steam has some new feature where they're trying to help support...

188
00:14:55,652 --> 00:15:00,434
In their case, Steam is trying to support local multiplayer games being able to play online.

189
00:15:00,474 --> 00:15:07,497
I wonder if that extends... This is idle speculation. Please don't take this as a fact of any kind.

190
00:15:07,597 --> 00:15:13,459
If that kind of support is possible in the long run to do LAN-style games over Steam's servers.

191
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
But I don't know anything about that. It just popped into my head.

192
00:15:17,401 --> 00:15:23,346
Um, uh, uh, IamPrite wants to know why can't we switch between old graphics and new graphics on the stream?

193
00:15:23,366 --> 00:15:24,568
Is it because of balancing issues?

194
00:15:24,848 --> 00:15:29,452
Oh, that may be because, um, uh, that may be because b-

195
00:15:29,573 --> 00:15:31,575
Oh, that- oh, I think he's talking about online multiplayer.

196
00:15:31,635 --> 00:15:32,696
So, I'm guessing-

197
00:15:32,716 --> 00:15:33,116
Yeah!

198
00:15:33,136 --> 00:15:35,098
Is that a balancing issue thing? Is that a technical issue?

199
00:15:35,932 --> 00:15:54,424
Yeah, it's more of a tech thing. Getting the real-time switching completed in the first place was kind of a piece of technical magic by Petroglyph and Steve Tall, who is the original lead programmer on Red Alert back in 1996, and he's now the technical director at Petroglyph.

200
00:15:55,645 --> 00:16:00,448
So he was able to kind of make the real-time switching happen, and originally we actually just only had it in the...

201
00:16:01,589 --> 00:16:04,230
That was the only place we could get it to work properly.

202
00:16:05,531 --> 00:16:09,372
After hearing some community feedback, we were able to extend that into Skirmish, which

203
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:09,893
was great.

204
00:16:10,693 --> 00:16:13,074
So it now works in all the solo play modes.

205
00:16:13,955 --> 00:16:18,577
But just the way that the whole game is architected, the way that the servers work, I'm not a

206
00:16:18,637 --> 00:16:21,738
technical person, so I couldn't properly give it justice.

207
00:16:21,998 --> 00:16:27,441
But the team says that it's just technically infeasible to make it work.

208
00:16:28,282 --> 00:16:31,086
for the online multiplayer, just given how the game is architected.

209
00:16:31,186 --> 00:16:35,092
So unfortunately that's just something we weren't able to accomplish.

210
00:16:35,834 --> 00:16:40,441
But we've been really happy that people enjoy the mode and the solo play.

211
00:16:41,025 --> 00:16:44,367
A bike rush also wants to know why we're watching legacy gameplay right now and what not.

212
00:16:44,407 --> 00:16:48,929
Remastered bike rush, I mentioned this earlier, as a newcomer to Command and Conquer, I was

213
00:16:49,009 --> 00:16:52,371
trying to put myself in the shoes of what you all were experiencing back in the 90s.

214
00:16:52,912 --> 00:16:55,973
And also, when I was switching between the two modes, I just had a preference for this.

215
00:16:56,033 --> 00:16:59,455
Like I mentioned at one point, like, you could take this whole aesthetic, make a new game

216
00:16:59,515 --> 00:17:01,396
on it that fits on the Nintendo Switch, and I would.

217
00:17:04,379 --> 00:17:12,044
That was one of the things that you know that was also one of those kind of creative pillars that we talked about the very beginning of the project was the idea of options.

218
00:17:12,064 --> 00:17:18,609
So you know, we understand that there's some people who just love the legacy feel they love the legacy look they love maybe the legacy sound.

219
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:24,874
We wanted to provide options for all those in the remaster.

220
00:17:24,934 --> 00:17:29,278
If you go to your options menu, you mentioned at the very beginning of the call, left-click, right-click.

221
00:17:29,438 --> 00:17:34,142
That was something that people debate about, and some people wanted to play with each.

222
00:17:34,182 --> 00:17:38,205
We have the option to choose right-click mouse settings, left-click mouse settings,

223
00:17:38,905 --> 00:17:45,151
right-click scrolling on or off, unit queuing on or off, depending on how authentic you want to be.

224
00:17:45,951 --> 00:17:53,876
And even for the audio options, being able to listen to the old EVA voiceover versus Kaya's new recorded HD voiceover,

225
00:17:53,996 --> 00:17:56,458
or the same for the sound effects, or the same for the music.

226
00:17:57,058 --> 00:18:02,262
And so, the idea of just giving players options and how they want to experience this,

227
00:18:02,302 --> 00:18:06,585
depending on their history with the franchise or not, was something that was really important to us.

228
00:18:07,362 --> 00:18:10,185
Right on. There's actually a really good question in chat.

229
00:18:10,906 --> 00:18:13,770
Why was the Humvee and Longbow renamed?

230
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:18,035
That comes from Badavin. Was that because of AM General slash Boeing?

231
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,921
A little bit, yeah.

232
00:18:21,021 --> 00:18:27,705
So, you know, there have been some, as I'm sure people have seen over the years, some

233
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:33,349
lawsuits and some things around the naming of certain vehicles that are trademarked in

234
00:18:33,389 --> 00:18:36,251
certain industry gaming franchises.

235
00:18:36,711 --> 00:18:39,433
And so that was something where, you know...

236
00:18:39,993 --> 00:18:51,297
In terms of the time that we wanted to spend on the remaster, we wanted to spend it more on making the game fantastic, rather than dealing with some of those legal challenges.

237
00:18:51,617 --> 00:18:57,018
So, yeah, we decided to go with the simpler route there and just rename things.

238
00:18:57,058 --> 00:18:58,839
And we pinged our community council about...

239
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:01,861
What names might be appropriate?

240
00:19:02,001 --> 00:19:08,987
So we kind of named them in kind of the same theming as what some of the older vehicles were in the legacy, like the Light Tank.

241
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:10,848
And so we came up with the Light Scout.

242
00:19:10,868 --> 00:19:17,394
So it was just something that was one of those things that didn't translate here 25 years later.

243
00:19:17,414 --> 00:19:23,559
But I think there's also been some mods already on the workshop that renamed those, if you so choose.

244
00:19:23,899 --> 00:19:29,062
He thinks there's been mods. I bet EA would be like, what? What? We don't know anything about that.

245
00:19:29,283 --> 00:19:31,224
Yeah, what are you already talking about?

246
00:19:31,244 --> 00:19:34,726
I would like to say that the quality of life options that are available in the settings are

247
00:19:34,746 --> 00:19:42,531
superb. Thank you. I'm going to... FunnyGuy77, I like your question. I'm going to springboard off

248
00:19:42,571 --> 00:19:47,835
that because I think that's a good question for Producer Jim, my new friend. Sorry, Jim,

249
00:19:47,855 --> 00:19:50,676
that's your nickname now. Awesome.

250
00:19:50,696 --> 00:19:52,578
You're no longer Jim Turn, you are Producer Jim.

251
00:19:54,639 --> 00:19:57,981
Funnyguy77 has a question about the sales of Command & Conquer.

252
00:19:58,021 --> 00:19:59,082
Sort of, how well is it done?

253
00:20:00,163 --> 00:20:02,705
And can we expect other remastered games in the Command & Conquer series?

254
00:20:02,785 --> 00:20:06,007
I think you're about to, on screen, you're about to see me discover that helicopter right now.

255
00:20:07,768 --> 00:20:09,510
Oh yeah, there we go.

256
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:13,993
The way I would actually like to frame that for our dev, any devs we have in the audience, is also...

257
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:19,896
What kind of sales goals does a game like Command & Conquer need to hit with a remastered version?

258
00:20:19,916 --> 00:20:24,879
Because this obviously isn't a fresh release, this doesn't have the same costs as a normal game,

259
00:20:24,899 --> 00:20:31,723
but this also doesn't have the same reach as a normal EA game that might be released if EA were to get back into strategy game development.

260
00:20:32,003 --> 00:20:36,505
So what were your thoughts as a production team about how the sales for this game had to do?

261
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:43,793
It's a pretty loaded question and obviously there's a lot of economic factors that go

262
00:20:43,834 --> 00:20:44,714
into it.

263
00:20:44,734 --> 00:20:50,400
I can't get into specific details around all the numbers just yet.

264
00:20:53,022 --> 00:20:58,146
The main impetus for doing the project in the first place was that we wanted to do something that was awesome for the community.

265
00:20:58,186 --> 00:21:04,070
We'd heard that feedback right about two years ago, that people wanted to see the franchise return to PC.

266
00:21:04,130 --> 00:21:10,574
And that kind of fervor from the community gave us the confidence that we could return the franchise to PC.

267
00:21:12,235 --> 00:21:13,456
and kind of do this project.

268
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:16,238
And, you know, from an economic standpoint,

269
00:21:16,258 --> 00:21:18,779
you know, we wanted to make the game really affordable.

270
00:21:18,959 --> 00:21:22,902
So, you know, we have only the $20 price point on it for both games,

271
00:21:22,942 --> 00:21:27,204
for all the expansions, for all the, you know, extra content and bonus gallery

272
00:21:27,224 --> 00:21:29,626
and everything that we've added in with no microtransactions.

273
00:21:29,706 --> 00:21:32,067
So we wanted to make the game really affordable.

274
00:21:33,841 --> 00:21:42,290
and that obviously does impact a bit the potential revenue for the title depending on what type of audience comes out for it.

275
00:21:42,471 --> 00:21:48,677
So we do have some internal goals based off the budget that we put together.

276
00:21:49,739 --> 00:21:54,244
What I can say is that we've been incredibly humbled by the launch so far.

277
00:21:55,706 --> 00:22:00,313
You know, follow kind of the Steam sales charts, which you can just find online.

278
00:22:01,414 --> 00:22:05,420
You know, we were kind of hanging out there in the top of the charts for kind of the past two weeks.

279
00:22:06,282 --> 00:22:09,967
You know, leading up from our preload time, kind of through launch and launch weekend.

280
00:22:10,868 --> 00:22:17,555
We're really excited by the response and it gives us renewed hope that Command & Conquer can still be a really relevant franchise for today's gamers.

281
00:22:26,933 --> 00:22:33,857
You know, in terms of kind of, you know, what's next, I know that's a really popular question right now in terms of the potential for future stuff.

282
00:22:34,417 --> 00:22:38,600
You know, what I can say is that right now we're focused solely on, you know, kind of our launch support.

283
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:46,344
So, you know, we are, you know, reacting to all the community feedback that's been coming in, you know, the bugs that people have been encountering, the quality of life improvements people want to see.

284
00:22:47,145 --> 00:22:51,267
Some of the features that, you know, just slipped from launch that we still wanted to complete.

285
00:22:51,967 --> 00:22:54,629
that we're planning to update here pretty soon.

286
00:22:55,149 --> 00:22:57,310
And so our focus is entirely on that,

287
00:22:57,770 --> 00:23:01,472
but we're going to continue to see kind of the reactions from launch

288
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:03,473
and see what the future could hold.

289
00:23:04,199 --> 00:23:07,802
I am Prite, I like your question, I'm going to get to it later however, because I'd like

290
00:23:07,822 --> 00:23:13,066
to springboard off Tuff Lipton's question here, which is, before the late great Eric

291
00:23:13,106 --> 00:23:17,028
Martin, GDI General Shepard passed away, was he aware of the remaster?

292
00:23:17,249 --> 00:23:20,751
Follow up question, what was it like, I know that you recorded some of the voice lines

293
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:26,195
from one actor for the remaster, what was it like working with the classic actors for

294
00:23:26,235 --> 00:23:29,478
this remaster, who definitely in the 90s when they were filming this probably never had

295
00:23:29,518 --> 00:23:32,340
any idea that the game they were working on would find this kind of fanbase?

296
00:23:33,962 --> 00:23:41,411
We actually got back in touch with a lot of the actors who participated in the original games,

297
00:23:42,052 --> 00:23:47,859
effectively to get their permission and their blessing to reuse a lot of their content,

298
00:23:47,899 --> 00:23:53,585
and everybody was super supportive of that notion, and they really wanted to see the game come out again.

299
00:23:54,166 --> 00:23:56,387
and to see those performances shine again.

300
00:23:56,427 --> 00:23:59,607
And so that was really great to see from everybody.

301
00:23:59,627 --> 00:24:01,428
And yeah, most of them, like you said,

302
00:24:01,468 --> 00:24:03,408
they never knew that this was going to take off

303
00:24:03,468 --> 00:24:06,489
and become a big game or a franchise that was beloved

304
00:24:06,509 --> 00:24:07,389
by millions of people.

305
00:24:08,169 --> 00:24:09,490
But they've always been humbled.

306
00:24:09,530 --> 00:24:12,751
And they'll say that they still get notes from fans,

307
00:24:12,791 --> 00:24:15,551
and they'll bump into people who recognize them.

308
00:24:15,591 --> 00:24:16,752
And that's always really cool.

309
00:24:18,251 --> 00:24:23,514
For Eric Martin, it was obviously super, super sad when he passed.

310
00:24:23,954 --> 00:24:29,998
He himself wasn't aware of the remaster when we were kicking it off,

311
00:24:30,038 --> 00:24:36,122
but we did get in touch with his family as part of this process.

312
00:24:37,923 --> 00:24:43,069
very happy that he was going to be able to have his kind of legacy live on in the remaster.

313
00:24:43,109 --> 00:24:46,292
And we hope that, you know, people like yourself who never played the original games

314
00:24:47,073 --> 00:24:52,819
are now getting a chance to kind of discover that performance and remember him in that way.

315
00:24:52,919 --> 00:24:57,605
And fortunately, we then were able to work with, you know, some of the crew that

316
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:08,681
that had done the original games like Kaia Huntsinger and Frank Lepaki who was the original composer for the games and worked on us with the remaster and remastered all the music.

317
00:25:09,802 --> 00:25:18,971
He was still in touch with Kaia and so we were able to bring her into the studio and get her to re-record all of her lines in high definition and it was...

318
00:25:19,712 --> 00:25:26,100
I mean for me as a super fan and a kid growing up with this franchise, getting to meet her

319
00:25:26,161 --> 00:25:31,628
and getting to see her perform all these lines again, it was a surreal experience and just

320
00:25:31,868 --> 00:25:32,609
a real pleasure.

321
00:25:33,791 --> 00:25:35,874
Everyone who worked on the game was just incredible.

322
00:25:36,290 --> 00:25:43,658
You know, professional and took it all very, you know, very seriously and tried to, you know, deliver their best performance that they could.

323
00:25:43,738 --> 00:25:45,179
So it was, it was just awesome.

324
00:25:45,219 --> 00:25:51,786
And it, you know, kind of gives you those, those, those kind of happy chills when you first hear some of those lines being re-recorded here 25 years later.

325
00:25:52,757 --> 00:25:57,138
I'm getting chills just thinking about it, mostly because I can just imagine it.

326
00:25:57,218 --> 00:26:01,459
Like I said, no attachment to Command & Conquer, but there are other games and franchises where

327
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:04,400
it's like getting the classic people back in the studio for that.

328
00:26:04,540 --> 00:26:09,681
It moves me too, which is funny, the things that can move you about that.

329
00:26:10,462 --> 00:26:11,842
That's super great to hear that his family...

330
00:26:13,522 --> 00:26:23,246
Martin's family was involved in the process because it's surprising to see the game industry have to start to deal with the fact that of using people's likenesses long after they've passed.

331
00:26:23,766 --> 00:26:33,310
It's just such a new kind of challenge that, especially now that digital recreations are becoming so prevalent, the ethical issues there.

332
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,811
It's like, oh, well, no, that's Hollywood's problem. It's like, well, no, it's our problem, too, it turns out.

333
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:41,519
Yeah, that was a comment and a question. I'm sorry about that.

334
00:26:41,659 --> 00:26:49,404
What Red Tie Guy, I swear Twitch chat, you are stealing all the questions that I was thinking about beforehand and just asking them in chat, so I have to keep crediting you.

335
00:26:50,024 --> 00:27:00,370
Red Tie Guy has the perfect question for this, for these uncertain times, which is, what were some of the development challenges the team had once EA began transitioning to work from home?

336
00:27:00,410 --> 00:27:03,972
Because, reminder, we're in a global pandemic, once in a century global pandemic.

337
00:27:04,193 --> 00:27:06,614
Please wear a mask and keep six feet apart while you're in public.

338
00:27:09,062 --> 00:27:17,929
Yeah, so first red tag, I watch all your videos, so thanks for all the coverage over the past 18 months following the game.

339
00:27:19,371 --> 00:27:27,818
So yeah, we started working from home, it was literally like three days after we kind of did our big kind of announcement back in March.

340
00:27:28,738 --> 00:27:35,944
So we kind of made this big announcement, we announced our launch date, we're like, we're coming out in June, and then we learned we had to kind of final the game working from home.

341
00:27:37,085 --> 00:27:39,686
which was going to be a crazy logistical challenge.

342
00:27:40,086 --> 00:27:44,088
And, you know, the teams just really, you know,

343
00:27:44,168 --> 00:27:45,988
continue to pour their heart and soul into the game.

344
00:27:46,028 --> 00:27:49,950
They continued to work in just a fantastic way together.

345
00:27:49,970 --> 00:27:50,030
And.

346
00:27:51,956 --> 00:27:54,177
We'd already been kind of working a little bit, kind of remotely.

347
00:27:54,237 --> 00:27:59,760
Obviously, I'm based here in San Francisco, and Petroglyph is in Las Vegas, and LemonSky

348
00:27:59,820 --> 00:28:04,522
is in Malaysia, so we already had a little bit of that kind of relationship in terms

349
00:28:04,702 --> 00:28:07,183
of how to work kind of in a distributed way.

350
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:11,004
But obviously, then all the individual people at Petroglyph were working from home.

351
00:28:11,805 --> 00:28:15,687
The biggest impact was around our testing capabilities.

352
00:28:15,787 --> 00:28:25,831
Our QA team is overseas in EA Studios over in Europe and in India.

353
00:28:26,291 --> 00:28:30,253
They were also working from home and they didn't have as much access to some of their hardware.

354
00:28:31,094 --> 00:28:35,596
We weren't able to utilize some of our larger PC hardware testing facilities

355
00:28:36,716 --> 00:28:38,077
because we just couldn't access those.

356
00:28:39,358 --> 00:28:45,323
The biggest challenge is that there were certain bugs, there were certain optimization items that we just weren't able to get to in the same way.

357
00:28:45,343 --> 00:28:52,149
And we've seen a couple of those things come up with launch now that we're seeing, you know, tens of thousands of people play the game.

358
00:28:53,713 --> 00:28:55,635
You know, and running into some of these issues.

359
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:58,518
So we're kind of now getting that feedback from the community,

360
00:28:58,538 --> 00:29:00,600
and we're trying to almost use their data in a way.

361
00:29:00,620 --> 00:29:04,663
You know, their feedback on Reddit and things about how to troubleshoot

362
00:29:04,683 --> 00:29:08,907
some of these items, and we're hoping to improve some of those in our upcoming patch.

363
00:29:08,967 --> 00:29:12,370
But yeah, it was kind of more the testing angle that became really

364
00:29:12,390 --> 00:29:14,993
the biggest challenge with the work from home situation.

365
00:29:15,355 --> 00:29:19,858
That's super helpful to hear, hearing developers be frank about what it's been like

366
00:29:21,298 --> 00:29:26,821
developing and finishing games under a global pandemic while just working from home.

367
00:29:28,042 --> 00:29:32,504
It's both a strange situation where, like you said, there's some remote workflows built already,

368
00:29:32,564 --> 00:29:37,366
so for so many people it's like, oh, well that's not a problem, and then you just stumble into the couple things

369
00:29:37,907 --> 00:29:41,208
that turned out to be problems that sort of no one, I guess, anticipated.

370
00:29:44,132 --> 00:29:47,818
I have about 10 minutes left on our clock.

371
00:29:47,878 --> 00:29:49,420
If you have 10 minutes for me, Jim.

372
00:29:50,181 --> 00:29:51,624
Of course, as much time as you need.

373
00:29:51,644 --> 00:29:52,024
Sweet.

374
00:29:53,787 --> 00:29:54,608
Let's see.

375
00:29:55,229 --> 00:29:56,371
Let's jump off of...

376
00:29:57,973 --> 00:30:04,859
It looks like Sgor00's question, Sgor00's question, I don't know how you pronounce that,

377
00:30:05,540 --> 00:30:08,643
their question's been answered in chat by other folks, but I will jump off.

378
00:30:09,363 --> 00:30:13,667
One really cool thing that you all did was that you released the source code for Command & Conquer

379
00:30:13,887 --> 00:30:14,628
a couple weeks ago.

380
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:18,772
Which is a boon for modders, it's a boon for other developers.

381
00:30:18,792 --> 00:30:23,376
Can you talk behind that decision and sort of what you feel that enabled,

382
00:30:23,437 --> 00:30:26,419
like why that was a good thing to do for a developer to release the source code,

383
00:30:26,840 --> 00:30:28,642
even while you were trying to sell a remastered collection?

384
00:30:29,838 --> 00:30:32,259
Yeah, well we wanted to do it for the community.

385
00:30:32,299 --> 00:30:39,741
I mean, the community is the group that has been keeping, you know, not only these two games alive over the past 10 to 15 years,

386
00:30:40,401 --> 00:30:46,803
with a lot of their community projects and mod support, but really kind of the franchise on PC in general,

387
00:30:46,863 --> 00:30:50,023
the Command & Conquer franchise. This is our first PC release in 10 years.

388
00:30:51,181 --> 00:30:55,284
And so it's really the community that has been keeping the franchise alive in that way,

389
00:30:55,725 --> 00:30:58,287
and we felt it was the right thing to do for them.

390
00:30:58,327 --> 00:31:01,750
It's something they've been requesting of EA for over a decade.

391
00:31:02,270 --> 00:31:07,935
And so we wanted to do it for them in order to give them that ownership

392
00:31:08,876 --> 00:31:14,020
to really take this franchise and these older titles into the future with us.

393
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,302
And so it was a process that took a long time.

394
00:31:17,462 --> 00:31:24,066
You know, there's a lot of a lot of different, you know, groups within EA that kind of need to review that and sign off on that.

395
00:31:24,146 --> 00:31:28,268
But we were we were happy to try and to try and do that for the fans.

396
00:31:28,348 --> 00:31:33,211
And we even worked directly with the community to, you know, on the actual license that we wanted to use.

397
00:31:34,208 --> 00:31:39,793
to make sure that it was going to be compatible with some of their fan projects like OpenRA and

398
00:31:39,833 --> 00:31:46,638
CNCNET. And so that's how we came upon the the GPL license and it was just great to collaborate

399
00:31:46,678 --> 00:31:50,962
with the community leadership to make sure that this was going to be a really celebratory moment.

400
00:31:52,203 --> 00:31:53,565
for everybody involved.

401
00:31:54,305 --> 00:31:57,309
We've already seen, I think, over 2,500 mods,

402
00:31:57,689 --> 00:31:59,090
or maps and mods,

403
00:31:59,631 --> 00:32:00,972
put up on the Steam Workshop

404
00:32:01,032 --> 00:32:02,914
in the first week, week and a half.

405
00:32:03,495 --> 00:32:06,498
And so it sounds like it's really resonating well with the community

406
00:32:06,518 --> 00:32:08,580
and that they're able to do these really cool things.

407
00:32:10,122 --> 00:32:14,866
And we hope to see that continue to flourish going forward.

408
00:32:15,617 --> 00:32:18,518
Right on. I think we're going to grab two more questions and then call it a day.

409
00:32:18,938 --> 00:32:20,199
Nilsan has a good question.

410
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:24,400
How is EA... Actually, you know what? I'm going to name the two people who want to take questions from.

411
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:26,321
Nilsan and SwedishLilac.

412
00:32:26,501 --> 00:32:28,181
We're going to get to your questions before we get out of here.

413
00:32:29,202 --> 00:32:30,602
Nilsan would like to know,

414
00:32:30,622 --> 00:32:32,483
are competitive balance fixes...

415
00:32:33,103 --> 00:32:35,904
planned like imbalance maps for underused unit breaks.

416
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:38,925
That's an interesting question because the followup for other devs, when you

417
00:32:38,945 --> 00:32:41,565
remaster a game like this in theory you're like we need to preserve as much

418
00:32:41,585 --> 00:32:43,886
of the original game balance as possible even if it was

419
00:32:43,926 --> 00:32:47,107
bad because that was the original game. But if you're supporting a live game,

420
00:32:47,527 --> 00:32:50,428
one that may get a competitive scene, I don't know if this has a competitive

421
00:32:50,448 --> 00:32:52,729
scene, but if it does we'll just assume it does for a second.

422
00:32:53,989 --> 00:32:57,110
How do you make that experience good for players today? Like that's in such an

423
00:32:57,190 --> 00:33:00,211
interesting question that has come up in these remastered conversations.

424
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:07,286
Yeah, it's been really top of mind for us and it's been one of the top community feedback topics since we launched.

425
00:33:07,386 --> 00:33:12,431
And going back to those original creative pillars, our goal was to keep it extremely authentic,

426
00:33:13,072 --> 00:33:20,038
to get that same feel and those same strategies working in the same way that people would have experienced with the older games.

427
00:33:20,899 --> 00:33:25,102
Another thing for us with balance is that all the balance was kind of tied together,

428
00:33:25,122 --> 00:33:33,428
so we didn't want to risk ruining the campaign or changing things like that with some of the balance changes.

429
00:33:34,949 --> 00:33:39,753
Now that we've launched, we're looking at some really targeted fixes immediately.

430
00:33:40,353 --> 00:33:46,278
One that we're updating, for example, in this upcoming patch is when you're on low power in Red Alert,

431
00:33:46,298 --> 00:33:47,318
where you're essentially just...

432
00:33:47,890 --> 00:33:52,814
You're completely out of the game. It takes like 27 times longer to build something if you're out of power.

433
00:33:52,854 --> 00:33:56,037
And that's it's almost more like a bug fix than a balance change.

434
00:33:56,117 --> 00:34:01,121
But it's something that we are going to update based off the community really being upset about it.

435
00:34:01,201 --> 00:34:04,524
We are also actually just yesterday.

436
00:34:05,385 --> 00:34:11,632
We updated our quick match rule set based on community feedback to change kind of the base default rules for quick match.

437
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:21,943
We swapped in and out a few of the quick match maps, and we're going to be hopefully doing a few more of those in the upcoming patch based off further feedback.

438
00:34:22,818 --> 00:34:28,983
We're looking at targeted changes that we think are really impacting the game,

439
00:34:29,823 --> 00:34:35,047
but we're still trying to understand if we should look at a bigger balance pass,

440
00:34:35,748 --> 00:34:39,290
or if that would change the spirit of what we set out to do too much.

441
00:34:40,511 --> 00:34:45,715
So we're still kind of looking at that, but we are in the meantime trying to do some of these targeted fixes.

442
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:52,776
Man, you're about to see me really learn for the first time why ground units can't walk over Tiberium.

443
00:34:53,116 --> 00:35:03,444
Um, uh, uh, and uh, Swedish Lilac's question was, uh, Jim, if you could make an entirely new Command & Conquer from the ground up, uh, what'd you want to?

444
00:35:05,746 --> 00:35:09,669
Well, I mean, uh, I'll just say, yeah, that would be amazing.

445
00:35:10,410 --> 00:35:15,154
Um, I, you know, as a fan of the series since I was, you know, 12 years old, and then...

446
00:35:15,733 --> 00:35:29,337
Having the chance to work on the Command & Conquer games from 2006 to 2010 with C&C3 and Kane's Wrath and Red Alert 3, those were some of my favorite development projects I've ever been on.

447
00:35:29,357 --> 00:35:35,318
And then going on this journey with the community and with Petroglyph, it's just been fantastic.

448
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:44,701
And so C&C has been kind of intertwined with my personal gaming life and my professional career life for as far as I can remember.

449
00:35:44,781 --> 00:35:45,121
And so...

450
00:35:46,742 --> 00:35:53,567
I would love to continue working on C&C, and we'll have to see what the future holds.

451
00:35:54,127 --> 00:35:58,491
Like I said, right now we're really just focused on supporting the launch of the Remastered Collection.

452
00:35:59,652 --> 00:36:05,516
But sure, if you're a fan of a franchise like that, who wouldn't want to be able to continue working on it?

453
00:36:06,036 --> 00:36:09,259
Right on. I can certainly agree with that sensibility.

454
00:36:10,059 --> 00:36:13,182
Jim, there's some kind of EA event going on tomorrow, isn't there?

455
00:36:13,202 --> 00:36:14,823
I guess we should give a plug for that.

456
00:36:16,056 --> 00:36:21,099
Yeah, I think we're doing our EA Play showcase.

457
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:24,221
I think it's going to last around an hour.

458
00:36:24,241 --> 00:36:29,265
You should check online for your local times on when it's going to show up.

459
00:36:29,285 --> 00:36:30,485
It'll be streaming online.

460
00:36:32,907 --> 00:36:37,150
We're hoping to have a celebratory call out there for the Remastered Collection.

461
00:36:37,170 --> 00:36:40,992
It should be a great event.

462
00:36:41,593 --> 00:36:45,455
I hope you all check it out to see everything that is coming up with EA.

463
00:36:46,022 --> 00:36:56,070
Right on. My current EA game that I am personally can't stop playing is Apex Legends, so shout out to the folks at Prespawn in case they happen to be watching.

464
00:36:56,670 --> 00:37:07,379
With that, I'm going to start wrapping it up. Thank you all on Twitch chat for joining us. Thank you to the Command & Conquer community because not only do we have you to thank in part for this game along with EA and Petroglyph and yeah.

465
00:37:08,639 --> 00:37:21,323
Lo and Sky, but if you all for showing up today and you all for being a big impetus force for this game existing, like I said, I am a newcomer to your world and I thank you for sort of building the foundation that I get to come in on.

466
00:37:21,903 --> 00:37:35,688
And with that, Jim, I assume this community has big ties to your Discord, your forums, etc. I assume that's already sort of generally known, but in case there was a question that didn't get answered today and they would like to have it answered, where should they go?

467
00:37:36,998 --> 00:37:42,720
Yeah, I think posting in the Command & Conquer subreddit is a place that I'm often checking all the posts.

468
00:37:43,500 --> 00:37:47,481
And then there's a bunch of community pockets in Discord where you can post.

469
00:37:47,841 --> 00:37:53,123
And if I don't see those directly, then they'll often be relayed to me with our community council.

470
00:37:54,183 --> 00:38:01,585
And so, yeah, please continue providing the feedback and questions, and I'll do my best to respond to as many as I can.

471
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:06,936
Right on, now before I horribly fail this mission, I'm going to bring things to a close and one more shout out.

472
00:38:07,216 --> 00:38:16,000
Chat, I can't say enough how great it is to start live streaming again on this channel and to come back with such a supportive, welcoming audience that is out there.

473
00:38:16,580 --> 00:38:18,901
So with that, have a good day everyone. Bye!
