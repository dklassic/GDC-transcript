1
00:00:09,212 --> 00:00:10,173
All right, we're going to get started.

2
00:00:10,313 --> 00:00:12,893
So we've been told to let you know to turn your cell phones

3
00:00:12,973 --> 00:00:13,093
off.

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:14,694
We'll make them silent before we get going.

5
00:00:16,174 --> 00:00:19,015
So this talk is about a class that we've both

6
00:00:19,055 --> 00:00:21,696
been running where students make a prototype

7
00:00:22,076 --> 00:00:23,477
every week of the semester.

8
00:00:24,917 --> 00:00:28,038
But it's really about more than just

9
00:00:28,098 --> 00:00:30,219
learning to make prototypes, which

10
00:00:30,259 --> 00:00:31,839
is the main theme of this talk.

11
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:37,331
So first, some quick introductions to who we are.

12
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:38,952
I'm Douglas Wilson.

13
00:00:39,132 --> 00:00:41,633
I'm a lecturer at RMIT University in Melbourne,

14
00:00:42,054 --> 00:00:44,835
Australia, where I teach and research game design.

15
00:00:45,375 --> 00:00:47,897
I also co-own a game studio, Degouta Fabrique,

16
00:00:48,337 --> 00:00:49,838
based in Copenhagen, Denmark.

17
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:52,439
And I'm Bennett Foddy.

18
00:00:52,859 --> 00:00:55,721
I teach at the NYU Game Center, and I make indie games as well,

19
00:00:56,141 --> 00:00:58,582
the most recent of which was Getting Over It with Bennett

20
00:00:58,602 --> 00:00:58,822
Foddy.

21
00:01:01,358 --> 00:01:04,840
In 2014, I started running a class in our master's program

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:08,281
at NYU where students make a digital game every single week

23
00:01:08,301 --> 00:01:09,002
of the semester.

24
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:12,663
And Doug later adapted it for the bachelor's students

25
00:01:12,723 --> 00:01:13,864
at RMIT in Australia.

26
00:01:14,604 --> 00:01:17,365
So in this talk, we're going to explain why we did that

27
00:01:17,805 --> 00:01:20,487
and how we implemented it and how that turned out.

28
00:01:22,707 --> 00:01:24,628
After my first year teaching at NYU,

29
00:01:24,768 --> 00:01:27,489
I was starting to feel concerned that there was like a handful

30
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:29,510
of things that I wanted to teach students, that I wanted them

31
00:01:29,550 --> 00:01:30,691
to get from me.

32
00:01:31,214 --> 00:01:33,595
that I couldn't get into a normal style of game

33
00:01:33,616 --> 00:01:34,416
production class.

34
00:01:35,777 --> 00:01:39,661
Students who came to us as very strong coders usually

35
00:01:39,681 --> 00:01:41,202
have been taught to engineer their code

36
00:01:41,262 --> 00:01:42,503
for large-scope projects.

37
00:01:42,543 --> 00:01:44,465
So for small projects, I think that habit

38
00:01:44,525 --> 00:01:48,368
tends to lock them into creative ideas too early in the process,

39
00:01:48,888 --> 00:01:51,190
and it prevents them from experimenting

40
00:01:51,230 --> 00:01:52,932
in the kind of free way that I wanted to see.

41
00:01:53,512 --> 00:01:55,854
But we also get weak coders, weaker coders

42
00:01:56,555 --> 00:01:59,637
with skills in other domains who could work very creatively

43
00:01:59,677 --> 00:02:00,198
and freely.

44
00:02:00,864 --> 00:02:05,526
except that writing code makes the whole process too slow to make fast iteration feasible.

45
00:02:06,107 --> 00:02:11,630
So because of those two problems, students tend to over-commit to their seed ideas

46
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,592
and they spend all of their time building their first idea rather than trying out different ones and seeing which ideas are good.

47
00:02:18,514 --> 00:02:23,056
Because most digital game classes involve students making just one or two projects,

48
00:02:23,536 --> 00:02:29,320
they get very invested in them emotionally and I think that makes it very hard to give the kind of robust critique I want to give.

49
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:30,893
without discouraging them.

50
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:34,814
You want to be able to get them to recognize and abandon

51
00:02:34,874 --> 00:02:36,715
unpromising ideas really early on.

52
00:02:37,435 --> 00:02:38,835
But in fact, what happens normally

53
00:02:38,876 --> 00:02:41,656
is you just wind up helping them to make the best of a bad idea.

54
00:02:42,397 --> 00:02:43,737
And that makes it really hard to help

55
00:02:43,777 --> 00:02:47,578
the students build a personal sense of good taste

56
00:02:47,638 --> 00:02:48,478
over time as well.

57
00:02:49,099 --> 00:02:51,659
And I think finally, if you're at school learning game

58
00:02:51,699 --> 00:02:54,520
design, I think making games is homework for you.

59
00:02:54,580 --> 00:02:57,901
And homework generally not as joyful

60
00:02:58,121 --> 00:02:59,482
as a real creative practice.

61
00:02:59,956 --> 00:03:02,457
So I felt like I wanted a class that would address some

62
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,798
of those challenges structurally.

63
00:03:05,899 --> 00:03:07,920
Doug and I are indie game developers.

64
00:03:08,340 --> 00:03:10,361
And the idea that we could solve these problems

65
00:03:10,421 --> 00:03:12,101
by changing the class format comes

66
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:15,043
from the spirit of rapid prototyping and jamming

67
00:03:15,083 --> 00:03:17,384
that has been prevalent in the indie games community.

68
00:03:17,404 --> 00:03:20,085
And of course, one of the biggest sources

69
00:03:20,125 --> 00:03:22,726
of inspiration for the idea is the Experimental Gameplay

70
00:03:22,766 --> 00:03:25,687
Project, where a group of four CMU students, led by Kyle

71
00:03:26,028 --> 00:03:26,408
Gabler.

72
00:03:27,182 --> 00:03:29,163
made a game prototype every week, more or less,

73
00:03:29,223 --> 00:03:30,304
and posted them online.

74
00:03:31,644 --> 00:03:35,227
And that ran for two semesters in the academic year of 2005.

75
00:03:35,907 --> 00:03:37,328
And it generated a lot of great stuff,

76
00:03:37,388 --> 00:03:39,249
including the prototype for World of Goo,

77
00:03:39,890 --> 00:03:41,431
but was never formalized into a class.

78
00:03:43,012 --> 00:03:43,832
Sorry, go ahead.

79
00:03:44,352 --> 00:03:47,374
More recently, there have been a few popular articles and talks

80
00:03:47,434 --> 00:03:51,257
about Game a Week as a strategy for budding indie game

81
00:03:51,277 --> 00:03:51,777
developers.

82
00:03:52,606 --> 00:03:57,531
So, for example, Rami Ismail, who co-owns the Dutch studio of Lambeer, famously wrote

83
00:03:57,551 --> 00:03:58,432
about Game A Week in 2014.

84
00:03:58,652 --> 00:04:02,176
You can find that article on Gamasutra.

85
00:04:03,377 --> 00:04:09,043
And actually, Rami's post directly inspired a number of game makers, including Ojiro Fumoto,

86
00:04:09,123 --> 00:04:14,870
who went on to make the successful roguelike game Downwell from a Game A Week process.

87
00:04:16,227 --> 00:04:20,269
Also in 2014, Adriel Wallach gave a GDC Europe talk

88
00:04:20,369 --> 00:04:23,350
about Game a Week as an indie dev methodology.

89
00:04:23,830 --> 00:04:25,310
This is actually a really useful talk

90
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:28,471
that explains the benefits of the Game a Week method,

91
00:04:28,791 --> 00:04:31,412
and I show it to my students in week one of my class.

92
00:04:31,452 --> 00:04:32,772
You can find this online.

93
00:04:35,353 --> 00:04:37,354
Chris DeCaitla has been coordinating

94
00:04:37,374 --> 00:04:39,234
the One Game a Month project on the internet,

95
00:04:39,254 --> 00:04:41,675
which has by now amassed a really large following,

96
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:44,036
kind of culturally very deeply in indie games.

97
00:04:44,857 --> 00:04:47,439
And I think these sorts of projects show that committing

98
00:04:47,459 --> 00:04:50,400
yourself to a regular cadence of projects is a really great

99
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:54,042
way to build up speed and also to try out left field ideas

100
00:04:54,122 --> 00:04:57,824
generally and enjoy the process of making video games.

101
00:04:58,524 --> 00:05:01,365
But we had an idea that there could be additional benefits

102
00:05:01,606 --> 00:05:04,207
to that practice in the context of a formal class,

103
00:05:04,907 --> 00:05:06,968
particularly if we added certain additional

104
00:05:07,008 --> 00:05:08,129
pedagogical structures.

105
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:12,311
So let's look a little bit at how we set it up.

106
00:05:14,487 --> 00:05:18,327
At NYU, the class exists in a two years master's level class,

107
00:05:19,368 --> 00:05:23,288
two years master's level course, which

108
00:05:23,488 --> 00:05:27,969
is limited to students who have already made at least one game

109
00:05:28,009 --> 00:05:32,690
by themselves and demonstrated some basic level of comfort

110
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,330
with their tools.

111
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:35,191
So I don't want it to be a class about learning

112
00:05:35,811 --> 00:05:37,851
to use Unity or Game Maker or anything like that.

113
00:05:38,591 --> 00:05:40,892
I want it to be about exploring creative ideas.

114
00:05:41,752 --> 00:05:43,592
It's about six hours of class time per week.

115
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:47,069
About two hours of that is given up to presentations and feedback,

116
00:05:47,489 --> 00:05:48,629
and the rest is just work time.

117
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:54,772
Students have to submit a playable digital game every week,

118
00:05:55,592 --> 00:05:57,533
and their grade is really heavily penalized

119
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,654
if they miss more than one week.

120
00:05:58,754 --> 00:06:01,335
So there's a lot of social pressure and a lot of structural pressure

121
00:06:01,675 --> 00:06:03,055
to turn something in every week.

122
00:06:05,496 --> 00:06:08,258
And every week's game is produced according to a given prompt

123
00:06:08,438 --> 00:06:11,099
or a constraint, like make a game about rainbows,

124
00:06:11,239 --> 00:06:12,900
or make a game that uses only one button.

125
00:06:13,957 --> 00:06:17,159
Being forced to dream up new ideas is part of the benefit of the class,

126
00:06:17,219 --> 00:06:20,180
so I just want to make sure that they don't just hit up their old notebooks

127
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,821
and remake old ideas.

128
00:06:24,782 --> 00:06:28,283
I tell the students that good work in the context of this class

129
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:30,824
should answer a particular unanswered question

130
00:06:31,445 --> 00:06:34,746
by testing the value of an original mechanic or an aesthetic design,

131
00:06:35,446 --> 00:06:38,007
by solving a design problem with an existing type of game,

132
00:06:38,388 --> 00:06:41,989
or by seeing if a game can produce a certain original type of experience.

133
00:06:42,658 --> 00:06:45,060
You can't get a good grade just by making Pac-Man.

134
00:06:46,401 --> 00:06:47,602
The games only need to run.

135
00:06:48,142 --> 00:06:49,263
They don't have to be bug-free.

136
00:06:49,303 --> 00:06:51,504
And it's fine if they only work if you play them sort of

137
00:06:51,545 --> 00:06:54,767
generously in a certain way, so long as they form a useful

138
00:06:54,927 --> 00:06:56,688
answer of some kind or a useful test.

139
00:06:57,869 --> 00:07:00,571
And I get them to do all their projects alone as a way of

140
00:07:00,611 --> 00:07:03,413
ensuring that students broaden their skill set and learn new

141
00:07:03,453 --> 00:07:05,294
ways to generate ideas and implement them.

142
00:07:06,074 --> 00:07:06,455
And of course,

143
00:07:07,239 --> 00:07:09,301
There's weeks where nothing comes together,

144
00:07:09,381 --> 00:07:11,403
and the result is a project which runs,

145
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:13,145
but doesn't really achieve or show anything.

146
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:15,447
And I make students still, in those cases,

147
00:07:15,508 --> 00:07:17,530
formally present that work, partly

148
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,753
to resist the idea that anyone's process is failure-free,

149
00:07:21,754 --> 00:07:23,496
and partly to share what they learned

150
00:07:23,996 --> 00:07:25,738
from that process of failure with each other.

151
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,860
So that's one crucial way that it

152
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,963
differs from game a week outside of the class format.

153
00:07:33,172 --> 00:07:38,514
All these structures apply a lot of pressure, which is not there in self-imposed game-a-week

154
00:07:39,315 --> 00:07:44,978
structures. So that pressure ensures a very high completion rate, normally close to 100%

155
00:07:45,818 --> 00:07:50,120
of all the projects come in, but it's also really stressful. So to try to relax that pressure

156
00:07:50,661 --> 00:07:55,883
and encourage freedom of experimentation in these students, I only grade them on the best three

157
00:07:55,923 --> 00:08:00,166
prototypes they make over the course of the semester, as selected by me at the end of the

158
00:08:00,186 --> 00:08:00,546
semester.

159
00:08:01,245 --> 00:08:04,668
that emphasizes fast failure and creative risk-taking.

160
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,591
Yeah, so the RMIT version of this.

161
00:08:09,771 --> 00:08:14,235
So in 2016, I took a faculty job at RMIT

162
00:08:14,415 --> 00:08:16,456
and inspired directly by Bennett,

163
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:18,438
wanted to bring this class format

164
00:08:18,538 --> 00:08:20,419
and evolve it for our program.

165
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:22,881
So for our first offering that year,

166
00:08:23,101 --> 00:08:24,982
which I coordinated, the class was taught

167
00:08:25,022 --> 00:08:28,044
by our PhD student and local Melbourne Indie,

168
00:08:28,085 --> 00:08:30,306
Michael McMaster, who's in the audience.

169
00:08:30,346 --> 00:08:30,766
Hi, Michael.

170
00:08:31,414 --> 00:08:36,797
So I want to note that the syllabus that I'll share at the end of this talk is actually partially built on Michael's syllabus.

171
00:08:37,558 --> 00:08:41,339
This past year, 2017, Michael and I co-taught the class.

172
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:48,603
So the class is specifically for second-year undergrads in our game design degree.

173
00:08:48,763 --> 00:08:55,707
So note that this class did not actually include any games programming students who are in a different school and a different degree.

174
00:08:56,668 --> 00:09:00,510
Our students at RMIT Games are mostly visual artists and designers.

175
00:09:01,189 --> 00:09:04,513
And in Australia, you tend to apply to a specific program.

176
00:09:04,913 --> 00:09:07,256
So our students have been taking game classes

177
00:09:08,077 --> 00:09:10,239
and focusing on game classes from day one.

178
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,502
So at this point in the curriculum,

179
00:09:12,702 --> 00:09:14,183
before they take game a week,

180
00:09:14,404 --> 00:09:16,346
they've already taken classes in Game Maker,

181
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:21,571
and Unity, and 3D art, prototyping, playtesting, and more.

182
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:26,800
By the way, this year, coming year, we may actually start bringing in some of the

183
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:30,602
games programming students to join, which would be great, but otherwise Game of

184
00:09:30,622 --> 00:09:37,044
Week is not an elective. It's not open to other degrees. This class, Game of

185
00:09:37,064 --> 00:09:41,666
Week, is actually one of three different streams the students can ballot into, so

186
00:09:41,766 --> 00:09:45,348
only about a third of our students end up taking the class, and they do so

187
00:09:45,428 --> 00:09:49,189
explicitly by choice, which is really important, which we'll talk a little bit

188
00:09:49,229 --> 00:09:49,670
about later.

189
00:09:51,369 --> 00:09:54,051
It's a 24 credit point class, which

190
00:09:54,111 --> 00:09:56,653
means it's about a half their semester workload.

191
00:09:56,693 --> 00:09:58,174
So in essence, Game of Week counts

192
00:09:58,214 --> 00:10:01,075
as like two of their four classes for the semester.

193
00:10:04,418 --> 00:10:07,299
And so it's three hours of seminar plus three hours

194
00:10:07,339 --> 00:10:08,440
of studio per week.

195
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:11,902
In the three hour seminar, we play all their game submissions

196
00:10:11,942 --> 00:10:15,204
from the previous week, and I do one-on-one feedback meetings.

197
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:17,546
Me or Michael do one-on-one feedback meetings.

198
00:10:17,933 --> 00:10:23,577
That takes about 90 minutes to get to a class of about 23-ish people.

199
00:10:24,578 --> 00:10:26,900
Then we reveal the new theme for the coming week.

200
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:32,464
We lecture about relative precedents, like different games or artworks that might relate to the theme.

201
00:10:33,524 --> 00:10:40,009
And finally, give them some time to brainstorm ideas and ask us questions about their ideas.

202
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:42,971
Later in the week, during the three-hour studio class...

203
00:10:43,675 --> 00:10:46,276
It's just the students working on their games in the lab,

204
00:10:46,657 --> 00:10:48,737
asking us questions and getting feedback

205
00:10:48,837 --> 00:10:50,978
before they actually have to submit the game.

206
00:10:53,459 --> 00:10:57,000
So in our version of the class, a little unlike Bennett's,

207
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:59,341
students can work alone or in pairs,

208
00:10:59,681 --> 00:11:01,682
but nothing bigger than pairs.

209
00:11:02,162 --> 00:11:03,783
And in fact, we encourage them to try

210
00:11:03,823 --> 00:11:06,924
out different configurations and partners per project

211
00:11:07,024 --> 00:11:08,125
over the course of the semester.

212
00:11:09,577 --> 00:11:12,218
We don't prescribe a preferred technology.

213
00:11:12,678 --> 00:11:14,959
Many of our students use GameMaker or Unity,

214
00:11:15,379 --> 00:11:16,800
which they've learned in previous classes.

215
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:19,942
But sometimes we also see random alternative technologies.

216
00:11:20,882 --> 00:11:24,444
We do want the students to be making digital games primarily

217
00:11:24,464 --> 00:11:26,625
in this class, although we do occasionally

218
00:11:26,765 --> 00:11:29,826
allow non-digital games if the student can pitch us

219
00:11:29,886 --> 00:11:31,547
on a strong idea for one.

220
00:11:33,583 --> 00:11:37,746
So part of the trick here is to get students assembling their own toolkits

221
00:11:38,087 --> 00:11:41,469
and building off the work of their previous week's submissions.

222
00:11:42,089 --> 00:11:46,492
Students do need to explore a fundamentally new idea each week,

223
00:11:46,752 --> 00:11:50,835
but we explicitly encourage the reuse of scripts and assets and so forth.

224
00:11:52,997 --> 00:11:58,260
This past iteration of the class I had students submit every single week.

225
00:11:58,942 --> 00:12:02,764
mostly because I wanted them to practice scoping and coping even in weeks where

226
00:12:02,784 --> 00:12:07,386
they're super busy and learning how to deal with that. However, as I'll actually

227
00:12:07,406 --> 00:12:12,048
talk a little bit later, I think this policy was a mistake. I think it was a

228
00:12:12,068 --> 00:12:15,570
little too stressful and so this year I'm going to give them one free skip

229
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:21,033
week at their choice like that does. We grade on three explicit criteria.

230
00:12:22,234 --> 00:12:23,755
functionality and style.

231
00:12:24,035 --> 00:12:26,235
So style is there to emphasize that we want the students

232
00:12:26,255 --> 00:12:28,916
to find their own creative voice through this semester.

233
00:12:29,276 --> 00:12:30,977
And it's something that Michael and I talk about

234
00:12:31,297 --> 00:12:33,597
explicitly in one-on-one feedback meetings.

235
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:38,479
And like Bennett, we don't grade every single game

236
00:12:38,519 --> 00:12:40,419
for the same reasons Bennett mentioned,

237
00:12:40,539 --> 00:12:43,320
in order to leave room for half-baked prototypes

238
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:44,200
and failures.

239
00:12:45,521 --> 00:12:48,601
So in the end, we end up grading four of their 11 games

240
00:12:48,661 --> 00:12:49,142
at various.

241
00:12:49,689 --> 00:12:51,450
milestones throughout the semester.

242
00:12:52,290 --> 00:12:55,872
What matters most is that they submit something each week

243
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:57,493
to avoid abduction.

244
00:12:59,654 --> 00:13:01,455
So there's some cultural differences,

245
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:04,957
both between bachelors and master students,

246
00:13:05,337 --> 00:13:07,719
and also between American and Australian students.

247
00:13:08,439 --> 00:13:10,120
So we don't do everything exactly the same.

248
00:13:10,841 --> 00:13:13,742
At NYU, in general, I'm trying to avoid

249
00:13:13,962 --> 00:13:15,823
showing students sample games.

250
00:13:16,244 --> 00:13:19,125
I think MFAs generally come to us very literate in games.

251
00:13:20,064 --> 00:13:23,485
But when I showed them precedent games every week that were relevant to the theme,

252
00:13:23,665 --> 00:13:27,307
I felt as though I was seeing those games influencing the work more than I wanted.

253
00:13:28,327 --> 00:13:31,708
And I wanted the MFA students to really head out into open water creatively

254
00:13:31,988 --> 00:13:35,530
and to make things outside of established genres, so I stopped doing that.

255
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:40,191
Yeah, I think really this might actually be the biggest difference between our two classes.

256
00:13:40,311 --> 00:13:45,913
So at RMIT, game a week is a really important place where we can build taste and expose students

257
00:13:45,953 --> 00:13:47,894
to lots and lots of games and artwork.

258
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:51,965
Each week when we lecture about relevant precedents,

259
00:13:52,405 --> 00:13:55,550
we'll show a video or have a student play the game

260
00:13:55,590 --> 00:13:57,113
on the big screen in front of the class.

261
00:13:57,613 --> 00:13:59,897
So on average, that means we get to talk about

262
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,920
like 10 precedent games or work.

263
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:07,603
each week. So over the course of the semester, that means we get to show them like over a hundred

264
00:14:07,883 --> 00:14:13,387
relevant games and artworks, which is just a massive amount to be able to expose the students

265
00:14:13,427 --> 00:14:18,750
to, which is really great. In fact, often Michael and I would even pick our weekly prompts based on

266
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:25,194
the kinds of work that we wanted to expose the students to. By the way, you can see all of

267
00:14:25,534 --> 00:14:31,138
Michael's and my week-by-week lecture notes at the end of our syllabus, which we'll link to at the

268
00:14:31,178 --> 00:14:31,818
end of the talk.

269
00:14:34,026 --> 00:14:35,667
So some other differences.

270
00:14:36,087 --> 00:14:38,828
Bennett has students do brief presentations to the class

271
00:14:39,028 --> 00:14:40,769
and also grades their participation,

272
00:14:41,069 --> 00:14:43,050
for example, when they're playing each other's games.

273
00:14:43,830 --> 00:14:48,192
At RMIT, I removed presentation and participation components.

274
00:14:48,832 --> 00:14:51,773
In my experience as an American working in Australia,

275
00:14:52,373 --> 00:14:55,194
Australian universities tend to emphasize public speaking

276
00:14:55,214 --> 00:14:58,736
a little less compared to comparable American programs.

277
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:01,497
And so unsurprisingly, our students are pretty anxious

278
00:15:01,717 --> 00:15:02,957
about public speaking.

279
00:15:03,539 --> 00:15:05,280
So the stress of doing Game of Week

280
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:08,381
is like kind of more than enough in and of itself.

281
00:15:08,481 --> 00:15:11,323
So I wanted to make the class as welcoming as possible.

282
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:15,544
We do cover public speaking in a number of our other classes,

283
00:15:15,665 --> 00:15:17,745
and I wanted Game of Week to be more focused.

284
00:15:19,866 --> 00:15:22,047
Both of us eliminated all readings and written work

285
00:15:22,067 --> 00:15:23,348
from the class to save on time.

286
00:15:23,368 --> 00:15:25,809
You really are pressed for time as a student in this class.

287
00:15:27,093 --> 00:15:29,954
And at first I got students to give each other feedback

288
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,554
as part of their public presentations

289
00:15:31,594 --> 00:15:33,115
in front of the class, but I found

290
00:15:33,155 --> 00:15:36,395
that that tended to inhibit them from making

291
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,896
personal work or vulnerable work.

292
00:15:38,396 --> 00:15:41,237
And it also resulted in very shallow, useless style

293
00:15:41,257 --> 00:15:43,337
of feedback, given the number of games that we had to see.

294
00:15:43,417 --> 00:15:47,678
So now they get and give feedback in person, one on one,

295
00:15:48,519 --> 00:15:50,919
and only after actually playing each other's games.

296
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:54,740
Lastly, we both make a.

297
00:15:55,602 --> 00:15:58,843
theatrical, ritualized presentation of the prompt every week.

298
00:15:59,463 --> 00:16:00,944
The first time I ran this class in 2014,

299
00:16:01,764 --> 00:16:04,245
I just told students the creative prompt

300
00:16:04,265 --> 00:16:05,465
at the beginning of the class,

301
00:16:06,205 --> 00:16:08,226
and I think about a third of them every week

302
00:16:08,306 --> 00:16:10,127
would just really phone in their projects.

303
00:16:10,307 --> 00:16:12,908
And I felt as though they had the ability and the interest,

304
00:16:13,168 --> 00:16:15,409
but their whole situation was just a bit too casual.

305
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,871
So I started making a big multimedia reveal of the prompt,

306
00:16:20,931 --> 00:16:21,691
like this video.

307
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:24,672
The main thing is that it has to show some effort on my part.

308
00:16:25,116 --> 00:16:27,757
to pressure the students to apply a similar amount of effort in their work.

309
00:17:11,427 --> 00:17:14,148
If you haven't got it yet, the prompt for this week,

310
00:17:14,168 --> 00:17:20,069
we'll see in a second, integers.

311
00:17:23,990 --> 00:17:25,590
So after I started doing that, I found

312
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:28,011
the number of phoned-in projects just dropped almost to zero.

313
00:17:28,191 --> 00:17:29,911
Really, really made an enormous effect.

314
00:17:30,732 --> 00:17:32,452
Sometimes I hide the prompt inside

315
00:17:32,652 --> 00:17:34,412
of a prototype-sized game.

316
00:17:34,572 --> 00:17:37,373
So this is a small game I made with the prompt hidden

317
00:17:37,413 --> 00:17:38,653
at the end of a difficult maze.

318
00:17:39,969 --> 00:17:45,972
And by doing that at least once every year, I hope to kind of indicate the correct scope for a one-week prototype

319
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,073
But also to kind of prove to the students

320
00:17:49,033 --> 00:17:54,496
that prototyping is enjoyable enough that I'll choose just to do it when I don't have to and

321
00:17:54,716 --> 00:17:58,418
Once a semester towards the end of the class when the students are starting to run out of energy

322
00:17:58,438 --> 00:18:06,062
I give each student a personalized prompt in a formal invitation letter that's designed to challenge their personal boundaries

323
00:18:06,302 --> 00:18:07,683
but also importantly

324
00:18:08,384 --> 00:18:11,866
to recognize the artistic identity that they've developed over the course of the class.

325
00:18:12,006 --> 00:18:16,427
So here, the quality of the game that they make out of this prompt isn't the point.

326
00:18:16,908 --> 00:18:20,969
It's to explicitly recognize their individual creative voices.

327
00:18:22,930 --> 00:18:29,193
So like Bennett, we also tried to ritualize the reveal of each prompt at our RMIT class.

328
00:18:29,393 --> 00:18:35,875
So first, we'd show a short teaser video, usually from a film or a TV show or an artwork.

329
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:39,176
usually something outside of games entirely.

330
00:18:39,196 --> 00:18:41,757
And then we'd have students guess in class

331
00:18:41,777 --> 00:18:43,378
what the prompt might be.

332
00:18:43,718 --> 00:18:46,259
So for example, here for the prompt ritual,

333
00:18:46,579 --> 00:18:49,720
I showed the famous excruciating candle carrying scene

334
00:18:49,800 --> 00:18:51,881
from Tarkovsky's film Nostalgia,

335
00:18:51,921 --> 00:18:53,402
if you've ever seen this.

336
00:18:53,482 --> 00:18:55,362
Yes, I make them watch like the whole nine minutes.

337
00:18:56,623 --> 00:19:00,885
And then we'd reveal the prompt in a nice juicy GIF.

338
00:19:01,525 --> 00:19:03,886
For example, here's that GIF for that prompt ritual.

339
00:19:05,137 --> 00:19:07,757
Another example here is the gift for the theme, Weird Input.

340
00:19:08,277 --> 00:19:10,318
By the way, all these gifts lovingly prepared

341
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:12,818
by my co-instructor, Michael McMaster.

342
00:19:12,838 --> 00:19:18,360
At RMIT, we also posted the prompt gifts

343
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:21,921
to the public on social media and encouraged our students

344
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:26,022
to publicly post their work under the same hashtag,

345
00:19:26,522 --> 00:19:28,962
hashtag game of week 2017 in this case.

346
00:19:29,942 --> 00:19:32,783
So this ritualization and public performance

347
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,063
helps make each week.

348
00:19:34,453 --> 00:19:40,115
seem like something greater and more real than just like a homework assignment for school.

349
00:19:41,255 --> 00:19:45,937
Also, logistically, the hashtag allows students to opt in on their own terms, like whether they

350
00:19:45,997 --> 00:19:50,638
do want to make their work public or not, and gives instructors like me a place to point to

351
00:19:50,678 --> 00:19:55,199
student work without having to play favorites. So instead of feeling pressure to retweet

352
00:19:55,599 --> 00:19:59,940
particular students, I can say, hey, go look at the hashtag that's collected a bunch of students' work.

353
00:20:02,004 --> 00:20:07,305
Another thing that we did to make Game a Week feel more like a community of art practice rather than just another

354
00:20:07,945 --> 00:20:14,928
university class was to arrange a public exhibition of the class games at local Melbourne art game space of Bar SK

355
00:20:15,708 --> 00:20:21,710
So this was opt-in and we had 10 students express interest so Bar SK co-founder and curator

356
00:20:22,430 --> 00:20:25,951
Louis Roots generously reviewed all the students Game a Week

357
00:20:26,716 --> 00:20:29,497
output and picked one game from each student.

358
00:20:29,998 --> 00:20:36,040
The games were then exhibited for two weeks in Collingwood, in Melbourne, in two waves

359
00:20:36,220 --> 00:20:37,381
of five games each.

360
00:20:38,522 --> 00:20:43,964
Note that we explicitly avoided branding the event poster with RMIT University, because

361
00:20:44,144 --> 00:20:48,546
part of the whole goal of Game a Week was for students to find their own artistic voice

362
00:20:48,726 --> 00:20:53,569
and start thinking of themselves as game developers like anyone else out in the real world, rather

363
00:20:53,589 --> 00:20:54,689
than thinking of themselves as just gamers.

364
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:59,976
students. So this was a nice move that we were really fortunate to be able to do to

365
00:20:59,996 --> 00:21:02,676
kind of take that out of the institution into Melbourne.

366
00:21:04,937 --> 00:21:09,379
One of the nice things about this class structure is the students get so many attempts at coming

367
00:21:09,419 --> 00:21:12,980
up with games that they're more likely to come up with at least one really great idea.

368
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:18,201
And that often comes after a period of sort of dialing in their process and their ideas

369
00:21:18,241 --> 00:21:20,782
and their taste and developing their artistic voice.

370
00:21:21,575 --> 00:21:24,658
So we're going to show you a few that originated in our classes,

371
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,339
with kind permission of the students.

372
00:21:28,181 --> 00:21:31,224
Jenny Jiao Xia made morning makeup madness

373
00:21:31,284 --> 00:21:35,308
as part of a series of funny self-portraits in my class,

374
00:21:36,149 --> 00:21:38,251
a game which has now been exhibited at various events

375
00:21:38,291 --> 00:21:38,892
around the world.

376
00:21:39,272 --> 00:21:42,555
And I think through the course of the semester,

377
00:21:42,595 --> 00:21:44,057
Jenny really found a way.

378
00:21:46,790 --> 00:21:51,073
She really found a unified vision for these self-portrait games to the point where she

379
00:21:51,113 --> 00:21:56,476
now has this kind of internationally recognizable style in visual design and in game design.

380
00:21:57,096 --> 00:22:01,558
And I think this game marks the turning point where her artistic voice really became clear

381
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:02,199
in this class.

382
00:22:04,040 --> 00:22:09,263
A.P. Thompson made prototypes for two IGF-nominated games in my class, Stella's Smooch and also

383
00:22:09,423 --> 00:22:12,785
this prototype for The Glitched, which went on to win the IGF student prize.

384
00:22:16,048 --> 00:22:19,110
The final version, which Jenny also contributed art to, looks like this.

385
00:22:21,651 --> 00:22:25,833
And I'm just showing this one as an example of how these one-week prototypes can become

386
00:22:25,853 --> 00:22:31,255
a platform that the students can use to build a bigger releasable project, either as part

387
00:22:31,275 --> 00:22:33,015
of their degree or after they graduate.

388
00:22:35,757 --> 00:22:39,638
The class is also a great place to try out ideas that there might not be room for in

389
00:22:39,658 --> 00:22:42,339
the context of a traditional class format.

390
00:22:42,439 --> 00:22:44,580
Nina Freeman made this prototype for Sybil.

391
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:47,914
a game where the player is given control of Nina's mouse cursor

392
00:22:47,954 --> 00:22:50,416
and embodied in her autobiographical experience.

393
00:22:50,816 --> 00:22:51,396
I'm the leader.

394
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,818
That game went on to look like this

395
00:22:53,858 --> 00:22:54,999
when it was finished and released,

396
00:22:55,079 --> 00:22:57,321
and it won the IGF Nuovo Prize

397
00:22:57,381 --> 00:22:59,242
and was nominated for two Choice Awards as well.

398
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:02,905
What's up?

399
00:23:02,925 --> 00:23:05,807
So our class at RMIT, Matthew Woods,

400
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:07,608
made a mall cop simulator

401
00:23:07,729 --> 00:23:10,070
where you watch AI-controlled customers

402
00:23:10,431 --> 00:23:13,333
on the various screens to report on shoplifters,

403
00:23:13,353 --> 00:23:14,934
if you can catch them.

404
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:20,114
This game, I think, is a great example of how really technically proficient students

405
00:23:20,414 --> 00:23:25,157
can make pretty ambitious, substantial progress in prototypes in just seven days.

406
00:23:28,179 --> 00:23:33,382
Joanna Tran honed her 3D art skills and ended up making a series of narrative, personal

407
00:23:33,482 --> 00:23:38,085
vignette games, including these two, Road Trip and Do You Remember?

408
00:23:38,634 --> 00:23:44,459
And over the whole semester, Joanna was working out a framework in which to place her visual art.

409
00:23:44,799 --> 00:23:51,065
And so it was really exciting to see her start to work out her own personal take on vignette games and what that might mean for her.

410
00:23:53,066 --> 00:23:59,032
In fact, partly because of social media and that hashtag, and Joanna tweeting to that hashtag,

411
00:23:59,662 --> 00:24:02,324
Some local Melbourne curators picked up on Joanna's work

412
00:24:02,864 --> 00:24:06,847
and invited her to talk about her work to an audience of over 200 people

413
00:24:07,327 --> 00:24:10,409
at prestigious Australian showcase Freeplay Parallels.

414
00:24:10,810 --> 00:24:14,512
And so Joanna ended up presenting two of her Game a Week prototypes

415
00:24:15,113 --> 00:24:17,995
alongside some of Australia's most famous game developers,

416
00:24:18,295 --> 00:24:21,337
like literally two weeks after the semester had ended,

417
00:24:21,798 --> 00:24:22,718
which is fantastic.

418
00:24:24,439 --> 00:24:26,521
Looking beyond the games that come out of the class,

419
00:24:26,861 --> 00:24:29,163
it's also really warmly received by students.

420
00:24:29,667 --> 00:24:31,167
It's always oversubscribed.

421
00:24:31,227 --> 00:24:33,969
The evaluations are consistently really positive.

422
00:24:33,989 --> 00:24:38,391
Here's a couple of pull quotes from the NYU and RMIT student evaluations.

423
00:24:39,352 --> 00:24:42,153
And the vibe in the classroom is really positive.

424
00:24:42,473 --> 00:24:47,256
Students find joy in this kind of ultra small scope work, particularly as they get faster

425
00:24:47,296 --> 00:24:50,717
and the technical challenges of making prototypes starts to fade into the background.

426
00:24:51,918 --> 00:24:55,660
It's important to mention as well, this isn't just a format that works for the most ultra

427
00:24:55,680 --> 00:24:56,460
talented students.

428
00:24:57,444 --> 00:25:02,549
All the students who take it see it as valuable and enjoyable as a class format,

429
00:25:02,709 --> 00:25:05,612
and they think that it improves the quality of their work

430
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:09,316
and gives them a sort of a taste of enjoying making games.

431
00:25:11,258 --> 00:25:14,642
OK, so to wrap up, some recommendations and acknowledgment

432
00:25:14,662 --> 00:25:16,664
of some challenges with teaching in this format.

433
00:25:18,164 --> 00:25:22,448
So I'm personally really happy about how Game a Week has been working out,

434
00:25:22,569 --> 00:25:23,570
at least at RMIT.

435
00:25:23,850 --> 00:25:26,873
But our students still struggle with semester long projects and

436
00:25:26,893 --> 00:25:27,834
their other classes.

437
00:25:28,314 --> 00:25:31,658
So I think it's important to make sure your curriculum deals with that kind of

438
00:25:31,978 --> 00:25:33,780
project management production skills,

439
00:25:34,261 --> 00:25:36,783
even before a final year capstone project class.

440
00:25:36,803 --> 00:25:40,967
So topping up and pairing Game a Week with also those longer planning skills

441
00:25:41,027 --> 00:25:41,348
classes.

442
00:25:42,881 --> 00:25:47,364
So the pace of Game of Week is probably too fast for students who are still teaching themselves

443
00:25:47,644 --> 00:25:50,226
Unity or 3D modeling or something for the first time.

444
00:25:50,606 --> 00:25:55,550
So I think it's really important that students who take this class be able to get far enough each week so that you can

445
00:25:56,170 --> 00:26:02,695
actually have something to say and critically discuss with them beyond basic like how to use the software questions.

446
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,431
And as I mentioned earlier, a game a week

447
00:26:05,531 --> 00:26:07,292
is one of multiple options for us

448
00:26:07,332 --> 00:26:08,832
that the second year students can take.

449
00:26:09,072 --> 00:26:11,793
And I would not want to make this kind of class mandatory.

450
00:26:12,073 --> 00:26:13,994
It's important to let students know beforehand

451
00:26:14,054 --> 00:26:15,455
how intense this class will be.

452
00:26:15,955 --> 00:26:18,256
And let them take it only if they really feel ready.

453
00:26:22,417 --> 00:26:24,518
The class really is a balancing act

454
00:26:25,038 --> 00:26:27,399
between applying the right amount of pressure

455
00:26:27,859 --> 00:26:30,160
and incentives, and on the other hand,

456
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:32,361
looking after the students with regard to burnout.

457
00:26:33,401 --> 00:26:40,343
For me, that has meant constantly emphasizing that failures are okay and not punishing people

458
00:26:40,383 --> 00:26:45,124
for weaker submissions and expressing that both verbally every week, but also through

459
00:26:45,144 --> 00:26:46,164
the structure of the class.

460
00:26:47,464 --> 00:26:54,406
For example, we both give feedback verbally, one-on-one, so there's no implicit shaming

461
00:26:54,446 --> 00:26:57,346
involved in public critique.

462
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:01,287
I alternate between using strict...

463
00:27:01,913 --> 00:27:04,674
highly specified constraints, like make a game with one button,

464
00:27:05,134 --> 00:27:06,595
and vague inspirational themes,

465
00:27:06,635 --> 00:27:09,596
so there's some creative breathing room on alternate weeks.

466
00:27:12,457 --> 00:27:14,258
And I think it's important to push the students,

467
00:27:14,338 --> 00:27:15,818
but you can take it too far.

468
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:18,259
A game a week can become very stressful,

469
00:27:18,499 --> 00:27:19,740
especially at the end of the semester

470
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:22,361
as people's final projects in other classes start to ramp up,

471
00:27:22,961 --> 00:27:24,962
and it's really useful to structure in some way

472
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:28,703
for them to opt out if the schedule is really bad.

473
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:34,504
So, just wrapping up really quickly, and then we'll be done.

474
00:27:34,884 --> 00:27:38,346
So the most important thing we want to emphasize is that Game a Week,

475
00:27:38,566 --> 00:27:43,348
as a formal class structure, is more than just learning how to work fast and

476
00:27:43,408 --> 00:27:44,128
scope properly.

477
00:27:44,928 --> 00:27:48,890
First, I think Game a Week as a class is also about taste making,

478
00:27:49,430 --> 00:27:52,391
whether that's through explicit lectures about precedence for

479
00:27:52,411 --> 00:27:54,592
the week's theme, like Michael and I do, or

480
00:27:54,632 --> 00:27:57,153
through weekly personal feedback from the instructor.

481
00:27:57,473 --> 00:28:00,955
And I think the sheer volume of games made in Game a Week.

482
00:28:01,698 --> 00:28:03,999
facilitates that kind of a taste evolution.

483
00:28:05,461 --> 00:28:11,225
A huge part of becoming a successful professional artist is learning to take your own work seriously

484
00:28:11,265 --> 00:28:13,087
and hold yourself to a professional standard.

485
00:28:13,787 --> 00:28:17,590
And I think one of the nicest things about this class is that it offers students a chance

486
00:28:17,630 --> 00:28:24,136
to be recognized as peers by the teacher and by the other students, but I think most importantly

487
00:28:24,236 --> 00:28:24,876
in their own eyes.

488
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:32,291
The class doesn't work as well without a sense of high occasion when the weekly themes are

489
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:32,672
revealed.

490
00:28:33,272 --> 00:28:38,236
So if anybody wants to run a similar class, I would really strongly suggest using a similar

491
00:28:38,256 --> 00:28:43,279
ritualization of the theme presentations to give the students that sense of occasion and

492
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,940
an extra boost of motivation.

493
00:28:46,722 --> 00:28:51,645
And finally, of course, one of the main reasons to run a class like this is the same as the

494
00:28:51,685 --> 00:28:56,468
reason to do it in your own creative practice outside of school, which is...

495
00:28:57,322 --> 00:28:59,123
that by building a very large number of projects,

496
00:28:59,143 --> 00:29:01,004
you have a chance to identify and really hone

497
00:29:01,024 --> 00:29:05,446
your own creative identity and explore different expressions

498
00:29:05,506 --> 00:29:06,106
of that identity.

499
00:29:07,367 --> 00:29:08,267
And that's really about it.

500
00:29:08,327 --> 00:29:11,169
We have one minute left, so probably not

501
00:29:11,189 --> 00:29:12,049
enough time for questions.

502
00:29:12,729 --> 00:29:16,211
We do, however, we've linked our syllabi publicly.

503
00:29:16,631 --> 00:29:19,632
Mine's annotated, and my syllabus also

504
00:29:19,692 --> 00:29:23,134
includes Michael and I's weekly extensive theme.

505
00:29:23,714 --> 00:29:25,798
notes, so please feel free to take a look at those.

506
00:29:25,838 --> 00:29:29,484
And Bennett and I are both super happy to answer questions,

507
00:29:29,504 --> 00:29:32,990
whether that's by email or in person, out in the hall

508
00:29:33,191 --> 00:29:33,852
