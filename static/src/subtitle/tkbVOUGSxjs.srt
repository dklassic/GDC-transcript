1
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:07,200
Good morning, everybody.

2
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,703
Hello and welcome to our panel, Ripple Effect,

3
00:00:09,783 --> 00:00:11,585
How Women in Games Initiatives Make a Difference.

4
00:00:12,066 --> 00:00:13,988
My name's Stephanie Fisher and I'm the panel chair.

5
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:15,730
Just want to remind everyone,

6
00:00:15,771 --> 00:00:16,852
please turn off your cell phones

7
00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:19,916
and please fill out your speaker evaluations after this.

8
00:00:20,941 --> 00:00:24,825
presentation. And before we start, I just want to let everyone know how we're actually going to run

9
00:00:24,865 --> 00:00:30,072
the panel. So all of us up here got our start in games via a community run wig initiative. And

10
00:00:30,112 --> 00:00:34,718
we're each going to give a short micro talk on, so you can get a sense of who we are, what we do,

11
00:00:35,178 --> 00:00:38,562
and how we've gone, you know, from wig program participant to our current positions or

12
00:00:38,823 --> 00:00:39,764
something generally like that.

13
00:00:40,915 --> 00:00:45,417
After that, we'll have a conversation that's going to be focused on providing strategies

14
00:00:45,458 --> 00:00:49,239
and resources on how to get more women into games, as well as how to work towards creating

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,880
a more diverse and inclusive industry.

16
00:00:51,941 --> 00:00:55,422
Post-panel will be in the wrap-up room, but we're only going to do that for ten minutes,

17
00:00:55,482 --> 00:00:59,344
and this is just for exchanging contact info and business cards, but please feel free to

18
00:00:59,384 --> 00:01:00,645
connect via email and Twitter, too.

19
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:03,893
OK, so who am I?

20
00:01:03,913 --> 00:01:06,514
I am a gender and games researcher

21
00:01:06,574 --> 00:01:07,894
from York University in Toronto.

22
00:01:08,674 --> 00:01:10,674
I'm a co-lead for a research project

23
00:01:10,715 --> 00:01:14,775
called Refiguring Innovation in Games, or Refig for short.

24
00:01:15,355 --> 00:01:18,036
I also belong to a lost generation of women

25
00:01:18,136 --> 00:01:20,637
who played games growing up, but for a myriad of reasons

26
00:01:20,697 --> 00:01:22,817
didn't think they could have a career in this industry.

27
00:01:24,557 --> 00:01:26,238
Back then, when I was a child.

28
00:01:26,789 --> 00:01:30,673
There were not a lot, or none, no game developing or coding

29
00:01:30,713 --> 00:01:33,416
initiatives that specifically targeted women or girls.

30
00:01:33,956 --> 00:01:35,357
Nowadays, this is clearly not the case.

31
00:01:35,738 --> 00:01:37,199
There's a lot of programs where kids

32
00:01:37,219 --> 00:01:39,001
can learn how to make games and how

33
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,604
they can learn how to code, both in person and online.

34
00:01:42,064 --> 00:01:43,365
These are just a handful.

35
00:01:45,848 --> 00:01:48,891
In 2011, I found myself managing one of these kids' game

36
00:01:48,931 --> 00:01:50,412
development camps at my university.

37
00:01:51,142 --> 00:01:52,882
And even though my role in this camp

38
00:01:52,962 --> 00:01:54,963
was as a manager and a curriculum developer,

39
00:01:55,283 --> 00:01:57,604
the kids would still ask me for programming

40
00:01:57,624 --> 00:02:00,245
or code-related questions when they needed help in Game Maker.

41
00:02:01,045 --> 00:02:02,786
And it sucked when I couldn't help them.

42
00:02:03,326 --> 00:02:05,166
I had to admit that I couldn't help them with their code.

43
00:02:05,307 --> 00:02:07,787
I felt like a poor role model for the girls in the camp who

44
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:09,168
looked up to female staff members.

45
00:02:09,728 --> 00:02:11,549
I really wanted to learn how to make more games,

46
00:02:11,669 --> 00:02:13,669
but I was just at the start of my PhD.

47
00:02:14,410 --> 00:02:17,071
And between work and school and more work,

48
00:02:17,351 --> 00:02:18,831
that really left me with little time or money

49
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,571
to do anything else.

50
00:02:21,498 --> 00:02:22,238
So what was I going to do?

51
00:02:24,179 --> 00:02:26,860
And what I can only describe as an incredibly stroke

52
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:28,421
of good luck, my research partner

53
00:02:28,501 --> 00:02:31,402
forwarded me over information for a women in games program

54
00:02:31,422 --> 00:02:33,323
that was accepting applications in Toronto.

55
00:02:33,923 --> 00:02:36,004
This program is called the Difference Engine Initiative,

56
00:02:36,524 --> 00:02:38,725
and it sought to bring more women into the Toronto game

57
00:02:38,765 --> 00:02:41,266
scene by helping 12 aspiring game developers make

58
00:02:41,306 --> 00:02:43,527
their first game in six weeks for free,

59
00:02:44,008 --> 00:02:44,988
no experience required.

60
00:02:45,368 --> 00:02:45,648
Perfect.

61
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,812
By the end of this program, I had made a game,

62
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:50,433
but I had left with so much more.

63
00:02:50,453 --> 00:02:53,316
I was so inspired by the potential of this community

64
00:02:53,356 --> 00:02:56,339
program and so impressed by the women who were a part of it

65
00:02:56,459 --> 00:02:58,440
that I actually changed my dissertation topic

66
00:02:58,580 --> 00:03:00,662
from educational games to exploring

67
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,204
the impact of WIG programs.

68
00:03:03,244 --> 00:03:05,386
So I'm not going to bore you with five years of research

69
00:03:05,406 --> 00:03:07,248
findings, because this is neither the time nor the place.

70
00:03:08,309 --> 00:03:10,731
But if I could sum it up in one ultimate takeaway sentence.

71
00:03:11,285 --> 00:03:13,447
It's that WIG initiatives that provides free support

72
00:03:13,467 --> 00:03:16,150
and training for adult women who want to make games

73
00:03:16,450 --> 00:03:18,592
not only gets more women into this industry,

74
00:03:18,953 --> 00:03:21,715
but also contributes to creating a diverse and inclusive game

75
00:03:21,755 --> 00:03:22,736
culture in the long run.

76
00:03:24,558 --> 00:03:25,359
Oops, sorry.

77
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:29,262
So while that might be a really obvious statement to someone

78
00:03:29,302 --> 00:03:32,045
who's already engaged in community organization work,

79
00:03:32,085 --> 00:03:33,627
not everyone actually thinks this way

80
00:03:34,507 --> 00:03:36,169
or sees the value in WIG initiatives.

81
00:03:38,279 --> 00:03:40,620
Some people think that focusing on special interest groups,

82
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,561
like women in games, does not work

83
00:03:42,601 --> 00:03:45,503
towards cultivating a fair and equitable industry for everyone.

84
00:03:45,983 --> 00:03:47,244
And they actually say it's going to lead

85
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:49,305
to further discrimination and division among us.

86
00:03:50,205 --> 00:03:52,386
So for example, in reference to the outcomes

87
00:03:52,527 --> 00:03:54,788
of the Difference Initiative specifically,

88
00:03:55,528 --> 00:03:57,249
these are some things that's been stated about it.

89
00:03:58,069 --> 00:04:00,691
Initiatives like the DEIs don't do an adequate job

90
00:04:01,031 --> 00:04:02,572
of addressing or actually treating

91
00:04:02,592 --> 00:04:06,514
the systemic biases that have made the games industry

92
00:04:06,554 --> 00:04:06,894
culture.

93
00:04:07,358 --> 00:04:08,759
less diverse, and less healthy.

94
00:04:09,779 --> 00:04:11,701
The DEI was designed as a creative space

95
00:04:11,761 --> 00:04:13,302
where people could challenge themselves,

96
00:04:13,842 --> 00:04:16,644
develop their abilities, and learn alongside each other

97
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,385
in a warm and encouraging environment.

98
00:04:19,106 --> 00:04:21,187
Instead, it was viewed as a support group,

99
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,649
underscored and necessitated by a reaction

100
00:04:23,689 --> 00:04:26,550
to an unequal social world where learning was secondary

101
00:04:26,590 --> 00:04:29,032
to the formation of bonds and relationships.

102
00:04:30,538 --> 00:04:32,459
That description of the Difference Engine Initiative

103
00:04:32,499 --> 00:04:34,499
was very surprising to the people who were actually in it.

104
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,701
We certainly didn't feel that it was this failure in the way

105
00:04:38,721 --> 00:04:40,601
it was being described, especially

106
00:04:41,082 --> 00:04:43,442
when the second iteration of the Difference Engine Initiative

107
00:04:43,723 --> 00:04:46,423
received almost universal praise for being a great success.

108
00:04:47,164 --> 00:04:49,064
This visualization, which was created

109
00:04:49,104 --> 00:04:51,905
by the talented Yuna Li, also a Difference Engine alum

110
00:04:52,005 --> 00:04:54,086
and who's in the audience today, demonstrates

111
00:04:54,126 --> 00:04:56,807
the impact of the program mere months after it ended.

112
00:04:57,797 --> 00:05:00,199
It's a little small, but every node in here

113
00:05:00,239 --> 00:05:03,921
represents the games, community initiatives, employment

114
00:05:03,961 --> 00:05:06,243
opportunities, presentations, or exhibitions

115
00:05:06,283 --> 00:05:08,044
that DEI participants were involved in.

116
00:05:08,524 --> 00:05:11,686
And this included organizing monthly meetups,

117
00:05:12,286 --> 00:05:16,569
running or participating in game jams, speaking at conferences,

118
00:05:16,709 --> 00:05:18,891
applying for funding, exhibiting our games.

119
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:22,793
And in addition to that, we did this work in our own time,

120
00:05:23,173 --> 00:05:25,054
and we made more games on top of that.

121
00:05:25,094 --> 00:05:26,395
So that's what failure looked like.

122
00:05:26,637 --> 00:05:28,541
It looks like maybe we should strive to fail more often.

123
00:05:30,785 --> 00:05:34,393
So meaningful cultural change is a slow process.

124
00:05:34,954 --> 00:05:35,535
It takes time.

125
00:05:36,438 --> 00:05:39,099
A six-week WIG program cannot change the industry overnight,

126
00:05:39,599 --> 00:05:42,401
but that really doesn't mean we should write off or give up

127
00:05:42,601 --> 00:05:45,102
on WIG initiatives as a lost cause.

128
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:49,865
All too often, positive outcomes of initiatives like the DEI

129
00:05:49,945 --> 00:05:51,926
are forgotten, or they're overshadowed

130
00:05:51,966 --> 00:05:54,227
by this kind of thirst to tell and repeat bad news

131
00:05:54,267 --> 00:05:57,349
stories about women in games or women in games groups.

132
00:05:57,829 --> 00:05:59,910
And we all know these stories by heart now.

133
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:02,631
Women are too sensitive or emotional.

134
00:06:02,711 --> 00:06:04,112
We need to grow thicker skin if we

135
00:06:04,152 --> 00:06:05,493
want to be a part of this industry.

136
00:06:06,847 --> 00:06:10,890
Diversity initiatives are negatively framed as handouts or special treatment.

137
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:15,334
My personal favorite is that we're all feminist bitches who can't get along, and we'd rather

138
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:16,976
tear each other down than build each other up.

139
00:06:17,817 --> 00:06:21,680
I don't know about you, but I think we need some new stories, and that's why we're here

140
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:21,921
today.

141
00:06:23,002 --> 00:06:27,005
As participants, organizers, and supporters of diversity initiatives, we stand before

142
00:06:27,025 --> 00:06:30,268
you today as the best evidence that WIG programs can and do make a difference.

143
00:06:31,329 --> 00:06:34,431
And so without further ado, I'm really honoured to introduce the panelists.

144
00:06:35,031 --> 00:06:38,032
Sagan Yee is the Executive Director of the Hand Eye Society,

145
00:06:38,392 --> 00:06:40,033
the Video Games Art Collective in Toronto.

146
00:06:47,437 --> 00:06:51,079
Rebecca Cohen-Palacios is the co-founder and current director of Pixels.

147
00:06:57,438 --> 00:06:59,519
which is a Montreal-based wig group.

148
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:02,461
She is also a dev at Ubisoft Montreal.

149
00:07:03,321 --> 00:07:05,582
Zoe Quinn is an independent game developer

150
00:07:05,622 --> 00:07:07,123
and the co-founder of Crash Override,

151
00:07:07,503 --> 00:07:09,084
a support network and assistance group

152
00:07:09,104 --> 00:07:10,705
for victims and targets of unique forms

153
00:07:10,745 --> 00:07:11,526
of online harassment.

154
00:07:11,546 --> 00:07:11,586
Oh.

155
00:07:11,606 --> 00:07:12,426
Thank you.

156
00:07:12,446 --> 00:07:12,626
Thank you.

157
00:07:12,646 --> 00:07:12,826
Thank you.

158
00:07:12,846 --> 00:07:13,026
Thank you.

159
00:07:13,046 --> 00:07:13,226
Thank you.

160
00:07:13,246 --> 00:07:13,427
Thank you.

161
00:07:13,447 --> 00:07:19,010
Thank you.

162
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:21,271
And Gemma Thompson is an independent game designer.

163
00:07:22,334 --> 00:07:25,235
chair of Diversity Sweden, co-founder of Ladycade,

164
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:27,476
and CheHack, two safe space communities

165
00:07:27,516 --> 00:07:29,136
which promote the enjoyment and creation

166
00:07:29,216 --> 00:07:30,337
of games, respectively.

167
00:07:30,357 --> 00:07:39,640
And so as this panel's gonna demonstrate,

168
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,520
there's many paths to making WIG initiatives

169
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:42,801
and diversity initiatives work,

170
00:07:42,921 --> 00:07:44,861
and they're not always straightforward or expected.

171
00:07:45,822 --> 00:07:47,502
Thank you, I will turn it over to Sagan.

172
00:07:53,677 --> 00:07:54,618
Hello, everyone.

173
00:07:54,958 --> 00:07:56,838
So I'm going to blast right through this.

174
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:58,219
We don't have a lot of time.

175
00:07:58,559 --> 00:07:59,479
So I'm Sagan Yee.

176
00:07:59,539 --> 00:08:04,381
I'm executive director of the Hand Eye Society, which is a nonprofit arts organization dedicated

177
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:07,522
to supporting video games made as a form of creative expression rather than a commercial

178
00:08:07,542 --> 00:08:07,942
product.

179
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:12,503
And they're the ones that sort of organized the difference engine to begin with.

180
00:08:12,543 --> 00:08:15,184
So now that I'm actually running the show, it's kind of...

181
00:08:15,764 --> 00:08:17,945
this again, this whole circle motif.

182
00:08:18,185 --> 00:08:20,287
I didn't have time to put together an awesome ripple map,

183
00:08:20,967 --> 00:08:23,648
but I did kind of put together some major milestones

184
00:08:23,708 --> 00:08:27,911
in kind of my spiral-like journey to how I got here.

185
00:08:27,951 --> 00:08:30,172
And I think this is kind of important

186
00:08:30,192 --> 00:08:32,733
to show these professional and personal

187
00:08:32,953 --> 00:08:35,155
artistic trajectories to demonstrate the impact

188
00:08:35,375 --> 00:08:36,695
Difference Engine had on my life,

189
00:08:36,736 --> 00:08:38,096
because if it hadn't happened,

190
00:08:38,416 --> 00:08:40,057
none of the things I'm about to talk about

191
00:08:40,257 --> 00:08:40,858
would have happened.

192
00:08:40,898 --> 00:08:42,238
And I had a slide here with the poster

193
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,580
for the butterfly effect with Ashton Kutcher's face on it,

194
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:45,440
and then I decided.

195
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:46,521
to not do that.

196
00:08:47,541 --> 00:08:50,682
So for some context, I just graduated.

197
00:08:50,702 --> 00:08:54,943
In 2011, I just graduated from a four-year classical animation

198
00:08:54,983 --> 00:08:55,403
program.

199
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:57,144
I moved to Toronto with no job prospects

200
00:08:57,164 --> 00:08:58,384
and a lot of time on my hands.

201
00:08:59,104 --> 00:09:01,165
And I stumbled upon the application for DEI

202
00:09:01,205 --> 00:09:04,806
by randomly googling Toronto video games.

203
00:09:04,946 --> 00:09:07,127
And the first thing that came up was this application.

204
00:09:07,387 --> 00:09:09,908
And they were taking six women who had never made a game

205
00:09:09,928 --> 00:09:11,448
before who were interested in it.

206
00:09:12,089 --> 00:09:14,530
I signed up because it was free, there was going to be free food.

207
00:09:15,911 --> 00:09:22,475
Reason number one, one reason to be, I enjoyed playing games but I never really tried making

208
00:09:22,555 --> 00:09:26,297
one before and another thing I wasn't making was money and I had really nothing better

209
00:09:26,317 --> 00:09:26,637
to do.

210
00:09:27,398 --> 00:09:31,620
But also one major thing that I only realized later on was really important was that it

211
00:09:31,660 --> 00:09:33,422
was aimed specifically at women.

212
00:09:33,882 --> 00:09:38,064
Even though words like feminism and diversity weren't really on my radar at the time.

213
00:09:38,705 --> 00:09:42,906
I don't think that, I'm not sure I would have applied if it hadn't been just for women.

214
00:09:43,727 --> 00:09:46,588
That detail really caught my attention because it made me feel like my presence would be

215
00:09:46,648 --> 00:09:50,329
expected and accounted for and it wouldn't be yet another situation where I'd walk into

216
00:09:50,349 --> 00:09:54,830
the room and be the only woman there and have to navigate that situation socially by myself.

217
00:09:55,311 --> 00:09:58,732
And I was also working on like this earthbound animation that I don't have time to talk about.

218
00:10:00,452 --> 00:10:05,856
So, Difference Engine 1, I made my first game called Icarus, which you just saw.

219
00:10:06,036 --> 00:10:10,179
And we were barely finished with first Difference Engine when the coordinators asked me if I

220
00:10:10,199 --> 00:10:13,982
would like to be one of two Difference Engine 1 participants to lead the second version

221
00:10:14,022 --> 00:10:14,563
of the program.

222
00:10:15,003 --> 00:10:19,245
The second participant being Yuna Lee, who made the amazing Ripple graphics that you

223
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,606
saw in the beginning.

224
00:10:20,846 --> 00:10:24,688
And I was like, I've only made one game in my life and it was the one I just made through

225
00:10:24,708 --> 00:10:29,331
your program and it's not even over yet and you're asking me to lead the second workshop?

226
00:10:29,351 --> 00:10:32,473
And they were like, yeah, yeah.

227
00:10:32,513 --> 00:10:36,895
And this was such a bold move on their part that I assumed they knew what they were doing.

228
00:10:38,087 --> 00:10:41,251
And so I don't necessarily think I was the most qualified person

229
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,153
to co-lead that workshop, but everyone

230
00:10:43,173 --> 00:10:44,315
had a really positive time.

231
00:10:44,736 --> 00:10:47,279
And as we will hear, all six participants

232
00:10:47,319 --> 00:10:49,342
are still working in or around the games community

233
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,344
to some degree, whether working in a studio

234
00:10:51,444 --> 00:10:54,088
or exhibiting their work at festivals or in Rebecca's case.

235
00:10:54,428 --> 00:10:56,009
co-founding their own organizations,

236
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,850
and I've even collaborated with a few

237
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,530
former participants on game projects.

238
00:11:00,831 --> 00:11:02,592
Again, I didn't make a Ripple tool.

239
00:11:02,692 --> 00:11:04,573
This was a six-week workshop for animators.

240
00:11:04,633 --> 00:11:07,494
I co-coordinated in 2014 with Matt Hamill,

241
00:11:07,514 --> 00:11:09,575
who's the artist on Lovers in a Dangerous Space-Time,

242
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:12,336
and I bring this up briefly so I can mention Paloma Dawkins,

243
00:11:12,356 --> 00:11:14,537
who made her first game, Dream Warriors,

244
00:11:14,577 --> 00:11:16,638
through this program, and she later went on

245
00:11:16,658 --> 00:11:18,299
to make Gardenarium, which was showcased

246
00:11:18,319 --> 00:11:20,700
at GDC Mild Rumpus last year,

247
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,501
as well as many other festivals and arcades,

248
00:11:22,541 --> 00:11:23,242
and that's like another,

249
00:11:23,642 --> 00:11:28,123
example of how someone goes through a WIG program and then they start running non-WIG programs,

250
00:11:28,203 --> 00:11:32,303
but it's still like women mentoring other women because you really want to like pay that forward.

251
00:11:33,564 --> 00:11:37,585
And Game Curious is a really major milestone for a number of reasons. This is a program I

252
00:11:37,645 --> 00:11:42,686
coordinated from 2013 to 2015 aimed at reaching out to communities outside of the traditional

253
00:11:42,706 --> 00:11:46,566
gamer network and encouraging people to explore the medium on their own terms. And I like to

254
00:11:46,606 --> 00:11:49,607
pitch it as a book club with buttons. And so...

255
00:11:50,747 --> 00:11:54,453
Oddly enough, when you start making an active attempt to draw in people from outside the

256
00:11:54,493 --> 00:11:59,139
group of people who self-identify as gamers, or actually going to different communities

257
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:03,045
rather than trying to make them come to you, things tend to get a lot less white male and

258
00:12:03,065 --> 00:12:03,806
heteronormative.

259
00:12:05,507 --> 00:12:10,271
So the impact of this was that Game Curious ended up attracting a very diverse pool of

260
00:12:10,311 --> 00:12:14,154
participants and volunteers, many of whom continue to be involved with hand-eye activities.

261
00:12:14,575 --> 00:12:19,679
Years after the first program, it led to an increase of women, people of color, and people

262
00:12:19,699 --> 00:12:24,343
of non-binary genders in paid positions and leadership roles within hand-eye society.

263
00:12:24,783 --> 00:12:31,048
And because of this, then that also in turn led to the inclusion of safer spaces policies.

264
00:12:31,409 --> 00:12:34,393
conversations around anti-oppression frameworks for staff and volunteers.

265
00:12:34,753 --> 00:12:37,617
And again, this is all because of the Difference Engine Initiative.

266
00:12:37,677 --> 00:12:42,584
If I hadn't gone through that program, then I wouldn't have been asked to lead this program

267
00:12:42,684 --> 00:12:47,351
and I wouldn't have led it in the way that I had if I hadn't done a WIG program in the first place.

268
00:12:48,542 --> 00:12:52,585
And if you're interested in strategies for growing a diverse, inclusive community, we

269
00:12:52,705 --> 00:12:56,769
have actually gotten funding from an organization called Refig to create a community toolkit

270
00:12:57,229 --> 00:13:01,112
and that's going to contain strategies and programming for creating similar initiatives.

271
00:13:01,632 --> 00:13:05,035
And that's, we're working with the Mount Royal Game Society in Montreal as well.

272
00:13:06,136 --> 00:13:08,879
And these are some game projects that I've worked on.

273
00:13:09,039 --> 00:13:12,803
And two of these games, Long Time Coming and Punk Prism Power,

274
00:13:12,843 --> 00:13:16,667
which actually ended up being shown at Indiecade.

275
00:13:16,787 --> 00:13:19,290
Night Games last year were both prototyped

276
00:13:19,410 --> 00:13:23,735
at Dames Making Games Jams, which is another WIG program

277
00:13:23,855 --> 00:13:25,336
in Toronto.

278
00:13:27,227 --> 00:13:33,048
So these are some quick notes about just my trajectory and becoming ED.

279
00:13:33,888 --> 00:13:37,990
So some important notes was that I was not only supported and encouraged to take on greater

280
00:13:38,030 --> 00:13:41,811
leadership positions, but also given freedom to make programming decisions with very little

281
00:13:41,831 --> 00:13:45,592
interference or pressure, and the result was that I never felt tokenized or that I was

282
00:13:45,632 --> 00:13:47,592
just being used as a diversity figurehead.

283
00:13:47,912 --> 00:13:52,313
I was, you know, really a leader in being accepted for my personal abilities.

284
00:13:53,754 --> 00:13:56,675
I became involved with other organizations, some game related, some not.

285
00:13:57,276 --> 00:14:00,817
For example, Allied Media Conference that focused on social justice issues, and I learned

286
00:14:00,857 --> 00:14:06,379
a lot of valuable frameworks of equity and community building outside typical sort of

287
00:14:06,419 --> 00:14:07,100
gaming spaces.

288
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,042
And my experiences as both a participant and coordinator of a WIG program has greatly influenced

289
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:16,924
how I make organizational programming decisions as director of a non-WIG organization that's

290
00:14:16,944 --> 00:14:18,305
been around for longer than I have.

291
00:14:18,485 --> 00:14:20,686
So I kind of inherited this non-WIG organization,

292
00:14:21,147 --> 00:14:23,088
but it was sort of a WIG organization

293
00:14:23,148 --> 00:14:24,549
that influenced how I ran it.

294
00:14:25,369 --> 00:14:27,331
And although Difference Engine no longer exists,

295
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,732
they kind of ran out of funding.

296
00:14:28,752 --> 00:14:31,333
They like did it twice and then kind of got forgotten

297
00:14:31,674 --> 00:14:32,414
for a long time.

298
00:14:32,674 --> 00:14:34,956
I continue to be supported by and draw inspiration

299
00:14:34,976 --> 00:14:36,617
from other WIG programs to this day,

300
00:14:37,477 --> 00:14:39,799
specifically Games Making Games, again in Toronto,

301
00:14:39,999 --> 00:14:43,201
and Pixels, and I'm still learning.

302
00:14:43,381 --> 00:14:44,302
So thank you very much.

303
00:14:57,419 --> 00:14:58,479
Hey, good morning everybody.

304
00:14:58,719 --> 00:15:01,081
You're all awake, and that is fantastic.

305
00:15:02,822 --> 00:15:06,664
So I'm Rebecca, and I am a game developer in AAA Games

306
00:15:06,744 --> 00:15:07,825
at Ubisoft Montreal.

307
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:11,867
I've been working as a UI developer artist for about 2

308
00:15:12,067 --> 00:15:15,189
and 1 1⁄2 years now, but I'm also the co-founder

309
00:15:15,229 --> 00:15:16,470
and director of Pixels.

310
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:18,731
And if you don't know about Pixels,

311
00:15:18,891 --> 00:15:20,432
it's a non-profit organization.

312
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:21,876
That's me.

313
00:15:22,337 --> 00:15:29,101
A non-profit organization dedicated to empowering women to create games through self-discovery,

314
00:15:29,341 --> 00:15:31,742
encouragement, community, and accessible learning.

315
00:15:32,383 --> 00:15:40,007
We host a variety of free programs like workshops, mentorship, writers group, yearly incubator,

316
00:15:40,688 --> 00:15:44,970
and my personal favorite, T-cade, which is a tea parlor arcade event.

317
00:15:46,271 --> 00:15:46,951
Five years ago.

318
00:15:49,303 --> 00:15:54,187
Five years ago, I was a programmer at a tech startup, Silicon Valley style.

319
00:15:54,208 --> 00:16:00,354
And my only experience with games was playing big ones made by hundreds of people out of

320
00:16:00,414 --> 00:16:01,335
renowned studios.

321
00:16:01,915 --> 00:16:05,178
I couldn't even fathom how they were made or what they looked like.

322
00:16:05,355 --> 00:16:08,477
were to even get started in this big amorphous cloud

323
00:16:08,777 --> 00:16:09,977
that is called game development.

324
00:16:10,757 --> 00:16:14,119
But one day, my friend told me about a video game incubator

325
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:16,200
for women called the Difference Engine Initiative.

326
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,861
And it helped six women make their first game.

327
00:16:18,981 --> 00:16:20,361
There was no experience required.

328
00:16:20,381 --> 00:16:23,262
And this just really reached out and spoke to me.

329
00:16:23,442 --> 00:16:24,643
Somewhere in the back of my mind,

330
00:16:24,803 --> 00:16:27,424
I had always, always, always wanted to make games.

331
00:16:27,544 --> 00:16:29,905
But how do you even game dev anyway?

332
00:16:30,845 --> 00:16:33,346
So over the course of six weeks.

333
00:16:34,796 --> 00:16:41,059
I made my first game, and I was with five other really amazing women, and we supported

334
00:16:41,099 --> 00:16:43,460
each other throughout this game-making process.

335
00:16:44,060 --> 00:16:48,523
What was really important about this experience for me, aside from making a video game, was

336
00:16:48,543 --> 00:16:49,964
this aspect of solidarity.

337
00:16:50,564 --> 00:16:54,666
Coming from the tech scene, where you had to be one of the guys, it was really, really

338
00:16:54,726 --> 00:16:58,308
refreshing to be able to meet other cool women who not only played games.

339
00:16:59,169 --> 00:17:01,731
but shared the same gendered experiences as me.

340
00:17:02,251 --> 00:17:04,833
It was a space where being a woman was okay,

341
00:17:05,133 --> 00:17:07,115
and that in itself was really relevating.

342
00:17:07,135 --> 00:17:09,777
It was this defining moment in my life

343
00:17:09,937 --> 00:17:11,918
and encouraged me to examine the power

344
00:17:12,098 --> 00:17:13,800
my identity had as a woman.

345
00:17:14,540 --> 00:17:15,721
Women are powerful.

346
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:18,663
Women can make games and exist as women

347
00:17:18,924 --> 00:17:20,905
in spaces that are predominantly made up of men.

348
00:17:22,291 --> 00:17:24,516
And my journey continued on from there.

349
00:17:24,536 --> 00:17:27,803
I moved back to Montreal and ended up staying there

350
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:32,072
when Feminists in Games approached me to run a difference engine in Montreal.

351
00:17:32,717 --> 00:17:35,718
And at the time, despite the numerous amount of studios,

352
00:17:36,239 --> 00:17:38,320
there was nothing dedicated to women in games.

353
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:43,283
So, in January 2013, my co-founder, Tanya Short,

354
00:17:43,483 --> 00:17:45,624
and I ran the Pixels Game Incubator,

355
00:17:46,044 --> 00:17:48,585
where we helped 10 women make their first game.

356
00:17:48,966 --> 00:17:52,207
And for this program, we received over 65 applications.

357
00:17:53,188 --> 00:17:55,129
And it was really, really clear that Montreal

358
00:17:55,229 --> 00:17:57,010
needed some support structure for women

359
00:17:57,070 --> 00:17:58,271
who wanted to be in games.

360
00:17:59,325 --> 00:18:01,646
And from there, Pixels just expanded.

361
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:05,167
We started a mentorship program where game developers can

362
00:18:05,207 --> 00:18:07,108
mentor aspiring women in games.

363
00:18:07,768 --> 00:18:10,469
And that matched up with a current game designer

364
00:18:10,609 --> 00:18:11,870
with an aspiring game designer.

365
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:13,330
So it was really kind of tailor-made

366
00:18:13,371 --> 00:18:14,551
for this personal experience.

367
00:18:15,691 --> 00:18:18,813
And I was still working for my tech startup at the time.

368
00:18:20,010 --> 00:18:23,691
So I asked my mentor, sorry, I asked Tanya for a mentor,

369
00:18:24,231 --> 00:18:27,592
Nicola, and he basically told me, like,

370
00:18:27,652 --> 00:18:28,313
what are you doing?

371
00:18:28,553 --> 00:18:30,133
You don't need to go back to school,

372
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:33,234
you don't need to, like, hone special skills,

373
00:18:33,274 --> 00:18:35,394
you have the skills right now as a web designer

374
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:38,455
to do user interfaces in games, so go, apply.

375
00:18:38,475 --> 00:18:41,676
And so I did.

376
00:18:41,696 --> 00:18:45,357
And I got into Ubisoft Montreal,

377
00:18:45,617 --> 00:18:47,878
and it was just like, whoa, it was kind of,

378
00:18:48,718 --> 00:18:53,902
reflection back on this like starting experience in a wig program and I've been

379
00:18:53,922 --> 00:19:00,987
I've shipped about two games now and I'm working on my third which is unannounced but it's really exciting

380
00:19:02,187 --> 00:19:04,951
And what's important to take away from my life story

381
00:19:05,111 --> 00:19:06,573
is that women in game initiatives

382
00:19:06,693 --> 00:19:08,895
have these long-term effects.

383
00:19:09,396 --> 00:19:12,380
They won't solve gender and diversity overnight,

384
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,063
but they have this incredible power to change lives.

385
00:19:16,024 --> 00:19:19,508
And from pixels, we have a ripple effect,

386
00:19:19,548 --> 00:19:21,671
which is also inspired by Yuna's fabulous work.

387
00:19:22,608 --> 00:19:26,891
And it shows the activities participants from the Pixels

388
00:19:26,911 --> 00:19:28,912
Game Incubator have done just one year later.

389
00:19:29,412 --> 00:19:32,114
So they've made games, they've run workshops,

390
00:19:32,134 --> 00:19:36,637
they've gone to game jams, they lead their own community

391
00:19:36,677 --> 00:19:37,177
programs.

392
00:19:37,618 --> 00:19:40,119
And it just creates a cycle of new makers

393
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:41,160
inspiring new makers.

394
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:43,221
And that is really, really exciting.

395
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:52,726
So what's important to take away is that women and other

396
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:55,069
diversity initiatives do work.

397
00:19:56,030 --> 00:19:57,772
And if someone tells you otherwise,

398
00:19:57,832 --> 00:20:00,194
then they clearly have no idea what they're talking about.

399
00:20:00,214 --> 00:20:02,377
Thank you.

400
00:20:13,185 --> 00:20:14,146
Hi, I'm Zoe Quinn.

401
00:20:14,886 --> 00:20:16,987
I'm going to be coming at this from a bit more

402
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,527
of a personal angle, so I don't have slides.

403
00:20:18,567 --> 00:20:19,768
I'm just going to kind of talk at you.

404
00:20:20,308 --> 00:20:22,089
Probably not surprising for anybody

405
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:23,369
that's familiar with my work.

406
00:20:24,910 --> 00:20:26,970
I came to the Difference Engine Incubator

407
00:20:27,090 --> 00:20:29,711
shortly after I had immigrated to Toronto

408
00:20:30,112 --> 00:20:32,232
with about two suitcases and a cat

409
00:20:32,292 --> 00:20:34,273
to try to make it as an artist in the big city,

410
00:20:34,293 --> 00:20:35,633
because the biggest thing that scared me

411
00:20:35,694 --> 00:20:39,215
was possibly getting to 40 and never having tried

412
00:20:39,335 --> 00:20:40,575
to do the things I wanted to do.

413
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:44,172
Somehow this led to beekeeping, photography, fire spinning,

414
00:20:44,352 --> 00:20:47,154
and eventually seeing a Facebook post on a friend's wall

415
00:20:47,654 --> 00:20:50,536
that advertised, much like Sagan, free food

416
00:20:50,576 --> 00:20:52,818
and live in that starving artist lifestyle

417
00:20:52,858 --> 00:20:53,959
made it seem kind of appealing.

418
00:20:53,979 --> 00:20:55,720
And I had been a huge nerd my entire life,

419
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:56,641
so I figured why not?

420
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,123
Six weeks later I had made my first game,

421
00:20:59,363 --> 00:21:00,604
which was called Dame Game.

422
00:21:01,484 --> 00:21:04,727
It was about a person that thought that she was a PI

423
00:21:04,947 --> 00:21:06,728
and was basically being a terrible roommate

424
00:21:06,748 --> 00:21:08,689
because an adventure game style,

425
00:21:08,729 --> 00:21:09,970
because that basically means you're just

426
00:21:10,337 --> 00:21:12,438
taking people's stuff and doing whatever with it.

427
00:21:12,478 --> 00:21:14,519
So I wanted to lampshade that.

428
00:21:15,640 --> 00:21:17,741
And from there, I got involved with the greater indie

429
00:21:17,761 --> 00:21:18,181
community.

430
00:21:18,201 --> 00:21:20,323
And since then, I'm going to sort of blip over any of the

431
00:21:20,363 --> 00:21:22,524
community organization stuff that I've done, just because

432
00:21:23,284 --> 00:21:26,046
Sagan and Rebecca have done such a good job at explaining

433
00:21:26,066 --> 00:21:28,567
their experiences with there, and more focus on what I've

434
00:21:28,587 --> 00:21:29,968
done with my career as a maker.

435
00:21:30,508 --> 00:21:34,570
So it's not just starting initiatives that we tend to

436
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:35,431
pay forward from these.

437
00:21:35,971 --> 00:21:38,012
I've also created things like Sorting Hat, which is

438
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:38,412
actually.

439
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:42,288
a twine game that's modified to be a conversation between the

440
00:21:42,328 --> 00:21:46,251
player and the sort of like list of resources. So it would be

441
00:21:46,271 --> 00:21:48,934
like, so you want to make your first game? Cool. Do you need

442
00:21:48,954 --> 00:21:51,756
art? And you say yes or no. And it gives you a whole bunch of

443
00:21:51,816 --> 00:21:55,079
resources based on that at the end. And sort of like I've

444
00:21:55,259 --> 00:21:57,461
become an engineer, like automating those conversations

445
00:21:57,501 --> 00:22:00,143
that I found myself having all the time. Similarly, I've made

446
00:22:00,183 --> 00:22:02,705
games are for everyone.com, which is a sort of sister site

447
00:22:02,745 --> 00:22:05,247
that has a lot more resources for beginning game developers,

448
00:22:05,687 --> 00:22:06,428
including things like.

449
00:22:06,803 --> 00:22:09,723
meetups, press outlets, anything you need to take it forward

450
00:22:10,023 --> 00:22:11,344
beyond just making your first game.

451
00:22:12,824 --> 00:22:15,544
I've also been in, and the cool thing about these initiatives

452
00:22:15,604 --> 00:22:18,225
is that I'm not just a woman, so few of us are.

453
00:22:18,245 --> 00:22:20,545
A lot of us contain multiple identities,

454
00:22:20,645 --> 00:22:22,186
so that this woman in Games Incubator

455
00:22:22,746 --> 00:22:25,926
actually brought a game developer into the space that

456
00:22:26,086 --> 00:22:28,627
made a game about mental illness that sort of blew up.

457
00:22:29,327 --> 00:22:31,727
Depression Quest, before we even got on Steam,

458
00:22:31,747 --> 00:22:35,028
had close to 2 million players and was designed to sort of,

459
00:22:35,485 --> 00:22:37,687
brings people who might not understand what living

460
00:22:37,747 --> 00:22:40,610
with depression was like into my own personal experiences of it

461
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:42,532
to try to build that empathy and to make

462
00:22:42,552 --> 00:22:44,493
people that were living with us feel less alone.

463
00:22:45,154 --> 00:22:47,576
So in a way, this women and games incubator

464
00:22:47,616 --> 00:22:50,239
had an probably unintended effect

465
00:22:50,339 --> 00:22:52,000
of also furthering the discussion

466
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:54,042
around mental illness in our industry as well.

467
00:22:54,442 --> 00:22:56,444
And it's important to remember when we talk about these

468
00:22:56,484 --> 00:22:59,727
incubators, it's not the phrase women and minorities,

469
00:22:59,807 --> 00:23:02,470
because so many of us are both and more than that.

470
00:23:03,096 --> 00:23:05,457
Beyond that, I've also looked at ways

471
00:23:05,477 --> 00:23:07,979
to try to make it more sustainable for people

472
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:08,980
once they're actually here.

473
00:23:09,120 --> 00:23:10,280
A lot of women in games initiatives

474
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:11,981
do a lot to bring new people to this industry.

475
00:23:12,402 --> 00:23:14,803
But in my current position, I'd like to figure out

476
00:23:14,843 --> 00:23:15,784
how to help them stay.

477
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,845
I think at this point, I don't need

478
00:23:17,865 --> 00:23:20,687
to explain how I've had an extraordinarily difficult time

479
00:23:20,787 --> 00:23:22,368
to continue to make games in this industry.

480
00:23:22,388 --> 00:23:24,149
I think that's fairly well publicized at this point.

481
00:23:24,789 --> 00:23:27,771
But I was also one of the first developers to get on Patreon

482
00:23:27,871 --> 00:23:30,273
and to look at and to try to advocate for that

483
00:23:30,373 --> 00:23:32,594
and to look at sustainable production methods for people

484
00:23:33,610 --> 00:23:35,592
might not make games that belong on Steam

485
00:23:35,752 --> 00:23:38,014
to help support initiatives like itch.io

486
00:23:38,414 --> 00:23:40,916
that help people distribute and be able to reach

487
00:23:40,936 --> 00:23:42,477
their audience outside of going through

488
00:23:42,517 --> 00:23:43,578
the mainstream kind of thing.

489
00:23:44,118 --> 00:23:46,520
I also run, I like to experiment with the form

490
00:23:46,721 --> 00:23:49,002
of games and game jams as well.

491
00:23:49,062 --> 00:23:50,684
I ran a program called Anthology Jam

492
00:23:51,124 --> 00:23:52,685
based off of a conversation I had

493
00:23:52,725 --> 00:23:54,667
with a fingerstyle guitarist in Leeds

494
00:23:55,107 --> 00:23:57,850
where we were discussing our love of short sci-fi anthologies

495
00:23:57,890 --> 00:24:00,071
and wanting to be like, oh, it would be really cool

496
00:24:00,292 --> 00:24:01,733
if we had a game version of that.

497
00:24:02,239 --> 00:24:04,460
And actually, Gemma was one of our participants.

498
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,941
And I think it was about 15 games that shipped.

499
00:24:07,342 --> 00:24:09,123
Some first-time game makers, everybody

500
00:24:09,223 --> 00:24:13,345
made their games in one month.

501
00:24:13,805 --> 00:24:15,286
We managed to publish it, and everybody got

502
00:24:15,386 --> 00:24:16,507
paid, which was super cool.

503
00:24:18,088 --> 00:24:20,229
The thing with these diversity initiatives

504
00:24:20,289 --> 00:24:22,310
is that you have to look at it like planting seeds.

505
00:24:22,771 --> 00:24:25,813
You might not see the benefit to it immediately,

506
00:24:25,873 --> 00:24:27,233
because these things need to grow.

507
00:24:27,674 --> 00:24:29,835
And as we grow these, it's important to remember

508
00:24:29,875 --> 00:24:31,536
to try to tend our garden as we do it.

509
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,651
If there's one thing all of these diversity efforts could do, I would also ask to encourage

510
00:24:37,691 --> 00:24:41,412
participants to make their own spaces if they enter the industry and still feel like they

511
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:43,972
might not belong here, because so many of us have.

512
00:24:44,492 --> 00:24:49,673
And I feel like when independent projects like this happen and actively reach out to

513
00:24:49,713 --> 00:24:53,874
communities and say, you can do this, we come from a place where we start with that level

514
00:24:54,014 --> 00:24:57,435
of, oh, awesome, I can do this, that means other people can do this, let's help other

515
00:24:57,475 --> 00:24:58,095
people do this.

516
00:24:58,595 --> 00:25:00,375
And that's something that gets overlooked a little bit.

517
00:25:00,796 --> 00:25:03,678
that this sort of cascading effect happens.

518
00:25:04,118 --> 00:25:05,599
We start with the belief that it can be done,

519
00:25:05,799 --> 00:25:07,140
that it's fine to be weird.

520
00:25:07,440 --> 00:25:09,061
We are all fucking weirdos anyway.

521
00:25:09,121 --> 00:25:10,582
And telling people that they can build things

522
00:25:10,642 --> 00:25:12,083
for people that are their kind of weird

523
00:25:12,123 --> 00:25:14,805
is a really empowering thing to do alongside game development.

524
00:25:15,566 --> 00:25:17,607
But in the meantime, I'm focusing,

525
00:25:17,707 --> 00:25:19,748
trying to figure out how to make more women

526
00:25:19,988 --> 00:25:22,310
and basically make more people that

527
00:25:22,350 --> 00:25:25,872
are dealing with any kind of oppression in the games

528
00:25:25,912 --> 00:25:26,773
industry stay.

529
00:25:26,873 --> 00:25:28,994
So going beyond just these starting conversations.

530
00:25:30,425 --> 00:25:31,405
and trying to mentor people.

531
00:25:31,445 --> 00:25:34,547
Mentorship should go beyond just the initial things,

532
00:25:34,587 --> 00:25:36,168
because once you get here, it's very easy

533
00:25:36,188 --> 00:25:39,090
to have so many questions, like, how do I negotiate a contract?

534
00:25:39,430 --> 00:25:40,630
What does porting look like?

535
00:25:41,051 --> 00:25:43,792
All these things to not just run and start these things,

536
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:44,913
but to continue forward.

537
00:25:45,533 --> 00:25:47,274
And I'd like to see more women stay.

538
00:25:47,434 --> 00:25:49,135
I'd like to see more women held up

539
00:25:49,215 --> 00:25:51,116
as auteurs and leaders and visionaries

540
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:53,417
for their amazing work, and not just the bad shit that

541
00:25:53,457 --> 00:25:54,158
happens to us.

542
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:56,779
I'd like to see them flourish, and not just survive.

543
00:25:57,290 --> 00:25:59,251
I'd like to see them not have to fight the same battles we

544
00:25:59,311 --> 00:26:02,093
already have or on other fronts of marginalization.

545
00:26:02,233 --> 00:26:05,054
Because at the end of the day, despite the legendarily hard

546
00:26:05,094 --> 00:26:07,576
time I've had in this industry, learning how to make games

547
00:26:07,616 --> 00:26:09,177
is still the best thing that's ever happened to me.

548
00:26:09,197 --> 00:26:11,418
Thank you.

549
00:26:11,438 --> 00:26:12,938
Thank you.

550
00:26:12,978 --> 00:26:16,380
Thank you.

551
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:22,643
Thank you.

552
00:26:22,664 --> 00:26:22,844
Thank you.

553
00:26:22,864 --> 00:26:23,344
Thank you.

554
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:23,564
Thank you.

555
00:26:23,584 --> 00:26:23,644
Hey.

556
00:26:24,212 --> 00:26:25,553
Yes, my name is Gemma Thompson.

557
00:26:25,893 --> 00:26:26,873
I'm a game designer.

558
00:26:27,334 --> 00:26:29,355
And as you could probably tell by my accent,

559
00:26:29,415 --> 00:26:31,015
I'm not even from the same continent

560
00:26:31,055 --> 00:26:31,996
as the rest of the panelists.

561
00:26:32,916 --> 00:26:35,157
But I did find that my experiences

562
00:26:35,217 --> 00:26:37,798
in games culture in the industry have actually strongly echoed

563
00:26:38,018 --> 00:26:38,299
theirs.

564
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,580
My career began really with a game design degree course

565
00:26:42,720 --> 00:26:45,382
in which there were four women to some 46 men.

566
00:26:46,442 --> 00:26:48,663
But things took a more prominent turn

567
00:26:48,703 --> 00:26:51,284
when I signed up to Europe's first all-female game jam

568
00:26:51,324 --> 00:26:51,384
in 2012.

569
00:26:53,024 --> 00:26:55,265
That experience instilled new confidence in my work,

570
00:26:55,906 --> 00:26:58,007
it started lasting friendships within this profession,

571
00:26:58,708 --> 00:27:01,370
and despite that gender segregated premise,

572
00:27:01,550 --> 00:27:03,351
it reassured me that I could actually engage

573
00:27:03,591 --> 00:27:05,432
in male dominated game culture,

574
00:27:05,573 --> 00:27:06,833
or at least as it was perceived.

575
00:27:07,694 --> 00:27:10,136
I stand now in 2016 as chair of Diversee,

576
00:27:10,376 --> 00:27:12,217
an organization which works extensively

577
00:27:12,257 --> 00:27:14,299
with companies, communities, and individuals,

578
00:27:14,399 --> 00:27:15,680
primarily in the Nordic region,

579
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,141
to promote and support a broad range

580
00:27:18,161 --> 00:27:20,063
of diversity efforts in and around games.

581
00:27:20,837 --> 00:27:25,122
More relevant to this panel, however, I'm also the co-founder of three separate initiatives,

582
00:27:25,282 --> 00:27:30,288
which, as I'm about to explain, have encouraged game creation and the celebration of games

583
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:35,674
amongst hundreds of new, shy, or disheartened female-identifying individuals across Northern

584
00:27:35,774 --> 00:27:35,995
Europe.

585
00:27:37,554 --> 00:27:41,518
So in my case, it all began in a 24-hour Game Jam event

586
00:27:41,558 --> 00:27:42,038
in London.

587
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:43,759
It was supported by a number of bodies,

588
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:46,101
including the UK's Next Gen Skills campaign.

589
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,524
And it's called XX Game Jam.

590
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:50,705
It was an all-female event arranged

591
00:27:50,725 --> 00:27:52,867
to coincide with Ada Lovelace Day in October 2012.

592
00:27:52,967 --> 00:27:56,971
It led to the creation of six rather wonderfully varied

593
00:27:57,011 --> 00:27:59,113
games, including the first one I could actually

594
00:27:59,173 --> 00:28:01,375
claim to have been involved in from start to finish.

595
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:05,168
It was also the first game jam I'd ever attended.

596
00:28:05,908 --> 00:28:08,029
And as I said, the friendships I forged here

597
00:28:08,049 --> 00:28:10,150
had to reach well beyond the British shoreline.

598
00:28:11,270 --> 00:28:14,311
I have worked with XS Game Jam alumni at other events,

599
00:28:14,371 --> 00:28:16,912
including List Summit in Copenhagen and Helsinki,

600
00:28:17,672 --> 00:28:18,433
and Anthology Jam.

601
00:28:20,333 --> 00:28:22,074
XS Game Jam also led three of us

602
00:28:22,174 --> 00:28:24,495
to found a women in games initiative of our own.

603
00:28:26,075 --> 00:28:27,636
That initiative is called Ladycade,

604
00:28:28,116 --> 00:28:30,037
and I've been running it since 2013

605
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,977
with Holly Pickering and Ennis McKendrick.

606
00:28:32,866 --> 00:28:37,009
It's an event which has steadily gathered more pace as years have gone on,

607
00:28:37,490 --> 00:28:40,652
and it's founded on the simple idea that women who make and enjoy games

608
00:28:40,712 --> 00:28:43,294
deserve a hangout space where they can feel safe and comfortable,

609
00:28:43,734 --> 00:28:46,176
but need not worry about being a woman in industry.

610
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:51,220
Nor will they have to spend the entire evening discussing how to get more women involved.

611
00:28:52,501 --> 00:28:55,683
What we do is we hold social events and games showcases,

612
00:28:56,404 --> 00:28:57,905
to which all genders are invited,

613
00:28:58,225 --> 00:29:00,567
but where the attendee demographic is at least 50% female.

614
00:29:02,411 --> 00:29:05,573
as in these snapshots of our first event in Nottingham

615
00:29:05,873 --> 00:29:08,154
and later on in London, which is the one shown on the right.

616
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,176
Thus far, we've held seven gatherings,

617
00:29:12,316 --> 00:29:15,037
either as stand-alones or alongside an existing event.

618
00:29:15,718 --> 00:29:18,919
We've worked to create events for three years running

619
00:29:18,979 --> 00:29:20,120
at Game City in Nottingham,

620
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:21,901
and we opened up last year's

621
00:29:21,961 --> 00:29:23,242
Creative Coast Festival in Sweden.

622
00:29:24,232 --> 00:29:26,554
Roughly 450 attendees have come to these,

623
00:29:27,074 --> 00:29:28,695
enjoying an atmosphere which many have described

624
00:29:28,735 --> 00:29:29,856
as disarmingly friendly.

625
00:29:30,377 --> 00:29:32,418
And this tends to be a sentiment shared mostly

626
00:29:32,458 --> 00:29:34,140
by the men in attendance, who we've

627
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:36,902
found to be just as tired as we are of nigh-on gender

628
00:29:36,922 --> 00:29:37,843
homogenous events.

629
00:29:39,044 --> 00:29:41,486
Many of these attendees have also partaken

630
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:44,529
of the games we showcase, indie titles being made by women,

631
00:29:44,729 --> 00:29:46,690
some of whom have never demonstrated on a show floor

632
00:29:46,710 --> 00:29:50,213
before, but have been encouraged to do so at a Lady Kade arcade.

633
00:29:50,233 --> 00:29:53,336
And that particular initiative works towards two goals.

634
00:29:53,780 --> 00:29:56,142
providing a platform so that more women can feel at ease

635
00:29:56,182 --> 00:29:57,503
showcasing their games like that,

636
00:29:58,023 --> 00:30:00,285
and tangibly proving that women are, of course,

637
00:30:00,445 --> 00:30:02,807
in these local communities making excellent things.

638
00:30:03,648 --> 00:30:05,650
It's this last point which I feel most strongly

639
00:30:05,710 --> 00:30:08,192
harkens back to my experience of the XS Game Jam.

640
00:30:09,072 --> 00:30:10,754
And it's hard for me to understate

641
00:30:10,774 --> 00:30:13,016
the importance of this visibility on a personal level,

642
00:30:13,396 --> 00:30:14,917
not least because, as I mentioned,

643
00:30:15,017 --> 00:30:17,079
that was the first one I felt comfortable attending.

644
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:19,713
I knew jamming to be a challenging activity.

645
00:30:19,833 --> 00:30:22,796
And having previously not felt comfortable dealing

646
00:30:22,856 --> 00:30:25,558
with gross gender disparity at these events as well,

647
00:30:25,899 --> 00:30:27,640
it added a bit of a relief, to be honest.

648
00:30:30,062 --> 00:30:31,964
Well, I can proudly say that game jamming is now

649
00:30:32,044 --> 00:30:32,945
one of the things I do.

650
00:30:33,365 --> 00:30:35,407
It's a productive hobby, which has taken me

651
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:36,488
all over northern Europe.

652
00:30:36,948 --> 00:30:38,990
And it's taught me much about rapid iteration

653
00:30:39,050 --> 00:30:40,071
elemental game design.

654
00:30:40,792 --> 00:30:42,653
As someone with very little coding ability,

655
00:30:42,673 --> 00:30:44,134
it's also been an excellent way for me

656
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:45,716
to keep making games outside of work.

657
00:30:46,939 --> 00:30:51,043
I overcame that initial confidence barrier after having embarrassment about my gender

658
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,284
removed from the equation.

659
00:30:52,664 --> 00:30:54,246
But the same can't be said for everyone.

660
00:30:54,726 --> 00:30:58,970
In the same way that Lady K draws exhibitors and creators out into a community which they

661
00:30:59,010 --> 00:31:03,394
then realize can be inclusive, I resolve to do the same for Game Jams.

662
00:31:04,895 --> 00:31:09,960
So as a sideways step, I am co-founder and vice chair of Game Jam Stockholm, a non-profit

663
00:31:09,980 --> 00:31:11,541
which bears its purpose in its name.

664
00:31:12,127 --> 00:31:17,631
We've run five events of various sizes so far, and although our actual demographics do vary between events,

665
00:31:18,052 --> 00:31:19,613
the general format has been the same.

666
00:31:19,973 --> 00:31:22,355
Positive outreach towards genders other than male,

667
00:31:22,875 --> 00:31:27,138
assuaging the fears of those who haven't jammed before and feel their skills aren't up to the challenge,

668
00:31:27,618 --> 00:31:33,062
and ensuring we have sufficiently safe spaces and the facilities to cater for vulnerable people from many walks of life.

669
00:31:33,903 --> 00:31:38,326
These efforts are being played out long term, since one cannot conjure up a diverse community from nothing.

670
00:31:39,738 --> 00:31:46,344
And in Game Jam Stockholm's case, we worked to ensure that the Swedish capital fosters a steadily more inclusive jamming scene.

671
00:31:47,705 --> 00:31:51,348
To that end, here's a rough breakdown of the gender split at our larger events.

672
00:31:51,949 --> 00:31:56,613
Women and non-binary people are represented by the orange and black sections at the top left of each graph.

673
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:07,262
After less than two years of operation, it is of course hard to project any sort of meaningful trends here.

674
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:12,757
But the bottom line is that we are bringing more women and girls into this hobby and the local game jam scene.

675
00:32:13,277 --> 00:32:19,742
We find, for example, that word will spread amongst student bodies and local studios, encouraging more of the women there to join in.

676
00:32:20,622 --> 00:32:28,127
A huge driver for this trend is also Game Jam Stockholm's collaboration with another outreach organization, which specifically supports girls and women in making games.

677
00:32:29,691 --> 00:32:35,534
Myself and Game Jam Stockholm's Inger Ekman are also co-founders of Chehack, a nationwide

678
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:39,815
scheme in Sweden which runs regular game creation clubs and events for girls and women.

679
00:32:40,676 --> 00:32:45,818
It began in 2014 with a free weekly after school club in a suburb outside of Stockholm's

680
00:32:45,858 --> 00:32:46,498
city centre.

681
00:32:46,959 --> 00:32:51,020
And this intentional move to bring game creation to families in the less social mobile paid

682
00:32:51,121 --> 00:32:55,142
huge dividends, particularly for the girls we have involved, who are aged from generally

683
00:32:55,202 --> 00:32:55,563
like 8 to 16.

684
00:32:56,995 --> 00:32:59,536
It's a pattern we hope to repeat in the wake of our recently

685
00:32:59,576 --> 00:33:02,718
completed nationwide tour, which took in seven towns and cities

686
00:33:02,778 --> 00:33:04,079
across mid and southern Sweden.

687
00:33:05,220 --> 00:33:06,781
Of those women we've involved in the club,

688
00:33:06,841 --> 00:33:09,503
two have recently rejoined games-related education

689
00:33:09,743 --> 00:33:12,064
on paths towards professional programming and art,

690
00:33:12,104 --> 00:33:12,725
respectively.

691
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:16,047
We've also eased theirs and other members' paths

692
00:33:16,087 --> 00:33:17,288
into local game jam events.

693
00:33:18,088 --> 00:33:20,490
What began with a girls and women-only pajama jam

694
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,471
at the Royal College of Technology in Stockholm

695
00:33:22,760 --> 00:33:25,761
became a 29-member strong mentor-led delegation

696
00:33:25,881 --> 00:33:28,022
at Global Game Jam Stockholm 2016.

697
00:33:28,722 --> 00:33:30,923
The Chehackers got stuck into all manner of games,

698
00:33:31,083 --> 00:33:32,924
including the one I've got running on a hat,

699
00:33:33,484 --> 00:33:36,086
running on a Gemma Arduino, which I'll be showing later.

700
00:33:38,447 --> 00:33:40,808
And that's primarily the handwork of Inge Ekman

701
00:33:40,828 --> 00:33:41,728
and Amandine Coget.

702
00:33:43,109 --> 00:33:44,830
It's worth saying that with events like this

703
00:33:45,170 --> 00:33:48,111
and Chehack's regular club meetings, our goal,

704
00:33:48,251 --> 00:33:51,012
as with Ladycade, is not to train or push for more women

705
00:33:51,032 --> 00:33:52,033
to enter the industry.

706
00:33:52,824 --> 00:33:54,705
Nor are we really there to educate.

707
00:33:55,005 --> 00:33:56,646
Instead, we promote the creation of games

708
00:33:56,706 --> 00:33:58,467
as an interesting endeavor in and of itself,

709
00:33:58,928 --> 00:34:01,589
and simply find that as a natural extension of that,

710
00:34:01,930 --> 00:34:03,251
these girls and women in Sweden

711
00:34:03,451 --> 00:34:05,312
are having their eyes open to vocations

712
00:34:05,392 --> 00:34:07,353
in game development and other related fields.

713
00:34:09,195 --> 00:34:11,076
This is the essence of the ripple effect for me,

714
00:34:11,176 --> 00:34:12,997
which I've just represented as a transit map.

715
00:34:14,474 --> 00:34:17,975
At XH Game Jam, I joined a practical and creative exercise

716
00:34:18,015 --> 00:34:20,076
which had previously appeared hostile to my gender.

717
00:34:20,436 --> 00:34:22,797
In the end, I was reassured both in my abilities

718
00:34:22,937 --> 00:34:25,517
and in my right to create in all kinds of subtle ways.

719
00:34:26,238 --> 00:34:28,558
And I've since spread that rather pure message to others.

720
00:34:29,298 --> 00:34:32,639
In working with Diva C, I strive to pass that on for message,

721
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,060
strive to pass that message on

722
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:36,461
for folks from other walks of life,

723
00:34:36,861 --> 00:34:38,581
and indeed get involved in explicitly bringing

724
00:34:38,621 --> 00:34:39,702
more women into industry,

725
00:34:40,042 --> 00:34:41,642
as with our GDC scholarship this year.

726
00:34:42,754 --> 00:34:46,879
Ultimately though, it seems that a gentler splash and smaller outward ripples have managed

727
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:51,785
to travel quite far enough for me and the things I've been working on, given that Stockholm

728
00:34:51,805 --> 00:34:53,988
is like 8,600 kilometers away now.

729
00:34:54,008 --> 00:34:56,411
And that is basically me.

730
00:35:07,098 --> 00:35:08,079
Thank you everybody.

731
00:35:08,099 --> 00:35:14,324
I think everyone's eager to have us talk about strategies

732
00:35:14,584 --> 00:35:15,585
and takeaway points.

733
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:22,230
So I guess my first question is, what are some strategies

734
00:35:22,350 --> 00:35:24,532
that you guys can share from your experiences

735
00:35:24,572 --> 00:35:27,914
that you want to share with the audience?

736
00:35:29,295 --> 00:35:30,156
Who wants to go first?

737
00:35:33,764 --> 00:35:49,321
I guess I can go first. So leading up to this panel and we were talking about, well, people will probably want to come away with some really concrete strategies for increasing women in their group or finding the women who are probably already there.

738
00:35:50,772 --> 00:35:54,076
Um, and so some interesting kind of observations came up.

739
00:35:54,117 --> 00:35:57,661
I'm going to name some of them and then maybe you guys can like chip in as well.

740
00:35:57,741 --> 00:36:02,947
But, um, like I kind of noticed that, um, because I run a non-wig organization,

741
00:36:02,967 --> 00:36:04,549
I'm suddenly facing.

742
00:36:05,430 --> 00:36:07,131
like, a lot of the challenges of like,

743
00:36:07,751 --> 00:36:09,231
because I've inherited this organization that's,

744
00:36:09,651 --> 00:36:13,792
that was pretty homogenous in terms of gender,

745
00:36:13,932 --> 00:36:15,673
like it's mostly male, mostly white males,

746
00:36:16,353 --> 00:36:18,173
that come out to the events that we do.

747
00:36:18,233 --> 00:36:20,034
So now that I'm in charge of the organization,

748
00:36:20,054 --> 00:36:22,354
I just took over late last year,

749
00:36:22,434 --> 00:36:24,675
so I'm wondering, you know, is my presence

750
00:36:25,095 --> 00:36:27,075
and the way that I run things going to...

751
00:36:28,356 --> 00:36:32,161
around in the long run because, you know, the whole reason I got

752
00:36:32,201 --> 00:36:34,925
into this was because difference engine initiative was aimed at

753
00:36:34,985 --> 00:36:41,593
women. But hand eye society is not a wig initiative. So a game

754
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:44,437
related event open to the general public with a wig

755
00:36:44,477 --> 00:36:45,759
sounding name or theme.

756
00:36:46,279 --> 00:36:48,962
seems to draw about 50% male-female ratio.

757
00:36:49,002 --> 00:36:51,163
So a lot of the, whenever Dames Making Games

758
00:36:51,444 --> 00:36:54,166
holds an event that's not just for women,

759
00:36:54,186 --> 00:36:55,347
they just open it up to everyone.

760
00:36:55,387 --> 00:36:58,870
It's always kind of like a 50-50 gender split.

761
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:01,352
Same with Ladycade, I think Jeremiah told me.

762
00:37:01,392 --> 00:37:02,953
Coming from the opposite angle, we find,

763
00:37:04,174 --> 00:37:07,036
yeah, it is called Ladycade, and yet,

764
00:37:07,737 --> 00:37:09,098
because it's open to all genders, we.

765
00:37:09,979 --> 00:37:11,660
It's kind of worst case we get 50-50 split.

766
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,961
It's mostly women, but yeah, we tend to get like a.

767
00:37:15,261 --> 00:37:18,403
Yeah, so that's like one really, really obvious thing

768
00:37:18,463 --> 00:37:22,225
is to just like name your thing something with women in it.

769
00:37:22,285 --> 00:37:25,847
And obviously, I don't know.

770
00:37:26,007 --> 00:37:28,688
It's, that was kind of just a interesting,

771
00:37:28,728 --> 00:37:30,069
I'm not quite sure what to make of it,

772
00:37:30,109 --> 00:37:31,690
but I thought that was really interesting.

773
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:33,491
And having events like.

774
00:37:34,171 --> 00:37:38,694
I want to do a gamer knitting circle where we learn how to make a scarf and then play

775
00:37:38,874 --> 00:37:45,438
Kirby's Epic Yarn or Little Big Planet or something and talk about textiles in games

776
00:37:45,959 --> 00:37:48,820
or the tea party idea.

777
00:37:51,145 --> 00:37:55,648
I was really interested in tea parties, so it came from this personal desire, but we

778
00:37:55,688 --> 00:38:03,554
ran a tea parlor slash arcade party where we had tea and we just generally chilled in

779
00:38:03,594 --> 00:38:10,060
the afternoon and just that kind of subversive feminine theme brought out this kind of excitement

780
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:16,505
in women and I saw a lot of new faces and equally men were excited about the tea party

781
00:38:16,565 --> 00:38:16,765
theme.

782
00:38:17,899 --> 00:38:20,842
It wasn't explicitly stated that it was geared towards women,

783
00:38:20,882 --> 00:38:25,145
but it had this kind of fun femininity to it

784
00:38:25,185 --> 00:38:26,806
that games usually don't have.

785
00:38:27,650 --> 00:38:29,611
Something I found since I primarily run,

786
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:33,014
like I've done events for LGBT organizations

787
00:38:33,054 --> 00:38:35,716
and other things like that is like having somebody visibly

788
00:38:35,877 --> 00:38:38,459
in leadership that's a member of the group is a huge deal,

789
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:39,259
obviously.

790
00:38:40,460 --> 00:38:42,702
For example, we had an event during GDC on Monday

791
00:38:42,742 --> 00:38:44,964
where it's like we did not say anything

792
00:38:45,124 --> 00:38:48,247
about any sort of diversity or gendering or anything like that.

793
00:38:49,331 --> 00:38:52,133
I think since it was being run by me specifically,

794
00:38:52,213 --> 00:38:55,977
like visibly run by a woman, as well as a very strict code

795
00:38:55,997 --> 00:38:57,618
of conduct at the door, that seemed

796
00:38:57,658 --> 00:39:01,061
to take into account things that might, like while writing it,

797
00:39:01,081 --> 00:39:04,123
it was like, OK, how can we eliminate potential anxiety

798
00:39:04,223 --> 00:39:06,205
that someone might feel walking into these spaces?

799
00:39:06,285 --> 00:39:08,907
So we stated up front, you know, you

800
00:39:08,967 --> 00:39:10,308
shouldn't have to drink here.

801
00:39:10,409 --> 00:39:11,770
You don't like just saying that.

802
00:39:12,705 --> 00:39:17,168
saying your wallet name does not have to match your RSVP name.

803
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:18,870
And the doorman have been assured of that

804
00:39:18,930 --> 00:39:21,672
to try to be more inclusive to people that don't have that

805
00:39:21,933 --> 00:39:22,573
going on for them.

806
00:39:23,194 --> 00:39:27,277
As well as just being very upfront with what the rules are

807
00:39:27,337 --> 00:39:31,080
and sort of reverse engineering it without saying,

808
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:34,563
we want this to be a safe space for these groups of people.

809
00:39:34,603 --> 00:39:38,147
But just doing the pragmatic little practical things

810
00:39:38,187 --> 00:39:40,188
like that seem to do really well for.

811
00:39:40,830 --> 00:39:42,952
just the kinds of attendance that we saw.

812
00:39:43,772 --> 00:39:45,374
I find that visibility also helps

813
00:39:45,454 --> 00:39:47,715
with growing a community or an organization,

814
00:39:48,075 --> 00:39:50,517
because being somebody who's visible

815
00:39:51,057 --> 00:39:52,819
makes you a bit more trustworthy.

816
00:39:53,159 --> 00:39:55,901
So the original people who identify that,

817
00:39:56,341 --> 00:39:57,662
oh, this person is running this thing,

818
00:39:57,702 --> 00:39:58,503
that seems good for me,

819
00:39:58,983 --> 00:40:01,325
then that word of trust can then spread.

820
00:40:01,505 --> 00:40:05,107
So as you make more events, then it, yeah, it develops.

821
00:40:05,988 --> 00:40:07,649
That's what I found with things I've been doing.

822
00:40:09,259 --> 00:40:14,501
And on the topic of safe spaces and code of conduct and stuff,

823
00:40:14,521 --> 00:40:17,803
you shouldn't just name your event something

824
00:40:17,863 --> 00:40:20,024
that will attract women and people

825
00:40:20,064 --> 00:40:23,946
from other marginalized groups and then not have anything

826
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:25,846
to back it up in case something does go wrong

827
00:40:25,926 --> 00:40:30,108
or if there is harassment or weird microaggressions going on.

828
00:40:30,408 --> 00:40:34,150
And there's a lot of really small details that if you're

829
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:34,370
not.

830
00:40:36,073 --> 00:40:41,295
If you're not a member of one of those groups that's affected by these seemingly small details,

831
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:45,736
then you'll probably overlook the fact that bars and alcohol do not necessarily result

832
00:40:45,776 --> 00:40:46,956
in safe spaces for women.

833
00:40:47,036 --> 00:40:52,358
And I found that Hand Eye Society, when they first started doing socials, they were always

834
00:40:52,418 --> 00:40:52,918
in bars.

835
00:40:52,958 --> 00:40:54,478
There was always alcohol involved.

836
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:57,939
And it was almost always just circles of dudes standing around.

837
00:40:58,740 --> 00:41:01,103
talking and it was like, you know, we went to a couple,

838
00:41:01,144 --> 00:41:03,147
after Difference Engine Initiative, we went to a couple

839
00:41:03,187 --> 00:41:05,610
and we were kind of like, well, we did this thing

840
00:41:05,831 --> 00:41:09,536
and, you know, the community's not exactly welcoming us

841
00:41:09,596 --> 00:41:12,080
with open arms and soon after that,

842
00:41:12,100 --> 00:41:13,843
they actually phased out the socials because.

843
00:41:14,924 --> 00:41:19,268
They just weren't very effective at getting people to socialize or bringing in new people.

844
00:41:19,628 --> 00:41:24,213
And I've actually taken it upon myself to bring that idea back, bringing back the monthly

845
00:41:24,253 --> 00:41:28,777
socials, but now I'm having it in a space where there isn't alcohol and we have dedicated

846
00:41:29,978 --> 00:41:33,221
volunteer greeters who are from diverse backgrounds.

847
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:36,404
and a lot of them are also involved with Game Curious.

848
00:41:38,185 --> 00:41:40,567
And just things like low-pressure jams

849
00:41:40,587 --> 00:41:43,930
with breastfeeding areas, having pronoun badges

850
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:46,252
is something that we utilize.

851
00:41:46,312 --> 00:41:48,454
And just all of these things contribute

852
00:41:49,134 --> 00:41:51,616
to a much more inclusive environment for everyone.

853
00:41:54,839 --> 00:41:55,439
Definitely.

854
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:59,442
And we had a really good experience

855
00:41:59,462 --> 00:42:01,364
with creating blanket forts.

856
00:42:02,293 --> 00:42:05,474
at our events and these are just really dedicated

857
00:42:05,574 --> 00:42:09,276
relaxing spaces where you can just go off to the side

858
00:42:09,336 --> 00:42:12,017
and talk or take a break from the crowds.

859
00:42:12,077 --> 00:42:16,880
And that is really helpful, especially as a new person

860
00:42:16,900 --> 00:42:18,801
in the community because you don't know anyone

861
00:42:18,821 --> 00:42:21,442
and you just might feel overwhelmed by going to these events

862
00:42:21,482 --> 00:42:24,583
so like, as Zey can mention, all these small details

863
00:42:24,643 --> 00:42:27,705
really do contribute to a healthier environment

864
00:42:27,785 --> 00:42:28,665
for your organization.

865
00:42:30,525 --> 00:42:33,847
We found that with, we put a focus at Game Jam Stockholm

866
00:42:34,068 --> 00:42:36,910
on making sure all the attendees have enough food

867
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:39,392
and drink to get them through, but we have found as well

868
00:42:39,432 --> 00:42:41,974
that having like dedicated food areas does mean

869
00:42:41,994 --> 00:42:43,736
you can have that sort of breakout space.

870
00:42:44,036 --> 00:42:46,278
And just like you say, if somebody's feeling

871
00:42:46,318 --> 00:42:48,700
a little bit nervous or something, we try to make sure

872
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:50,461
that a mentor is always available there

873
00:42:50,521 --> 00:42:53,123
to just like be a single point of contact

874
00:42:53,183 --> 00:42:53,744
and help them through.

875
00:42:53,764 --> 00:42:56,046
And the nice thing about this is like you see.

876
00:42:56,624 --> 00:43:00,592
so much pushback to any sort of inclusivity efforts is like well

877
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:02,049
special treatment, blah, blah, blah.

878
00:43:02,069 --> 00:43:03,410
But the thing about stuff like that

879
00:43:03,470 --> 00:43:04,871
is that's just nice for everybody.

880
00:43:04,891 --> 00:43:07,632
I mean, that's something, like having a quiet space

881
00:43:07,652 --> 00:43:09,032
where you can actually have a conversation,

882
00:43:10,473 --> 00:43:11,813
everybody stands to benefit from that.

883
00:43:11,973 --> 00:43:14,034
And similarly, having mentorship and stuff like that,

884
00:43:14,074 --> 00:43:15,075
that's good for all events.

885
00:43:16,075 --> 00:43:18,636
So it's like that stuff should be an easier sell.

886
00:43:19,516 --> 00:43:21,557
Similarly, if you do end up having events

887
00:43:21,617 --> 00:43:24,338
with alcohol present, it's really good to have people

888
00:43:24,378 --> 00:43:26,419
who are paying attention to what's going on

889
00:43:26,859 --> 00:43:28,420
and the comfort level of the participants

890
00:43:28,460 --> 00:43:29,940
that are willing to go in and just,

891
00:43:30,532 --> 00:43:32,452
non-invasively go and be like, hey,

892
00:43:32,753 --> 00:43:33,733
can I talk to you for a second?

893
00:43:33,773 --> 00:43:34,834
And then bring the person who looks

894
00:43:34,854 --> 00:43:37,155
like they're uncomfortable maybe out of that situation

895
00:43:37,195 --> 00:43:38,895
and be like, is everything OK?

896
00:43:39,376 --> 00:43:41,757
In a way that doesn't make them feel cornered or singled out,

897
00:43:41,777 --> 00:43:43,277
just be like, give them the out.

898
00:43:43,898 --> 00:43:45,658
A lot of us, I think, at conferences

899
00:43:45,698 --> 00:43:46,959
do that for each other too.

900
00:43:47,499 --> 00:43:50,661
Being able to be like, hey, fostering that,

901
00:43:51,061 --> 00:43:52,441
looking out for each other thing, I think,

902
00:43:52,481 --> 00:43:53,502
is super important as well.

903
00:43:57,192 --> 00:44:01,476
I do want to mention that if you are thinking about starting an organization, you don't

904
00:44:01,516 --> 00:44:03,098
need a ton of money to do it.

905
00:44:03,958 --> 00:44:11,325
Pixels ran an entire year on zero dollars and we are still a low budget organization

906
00:44:11,465 --> 00:44:13,126
and it's very nice actually.

907
00:44:13,146 --> 00:44:19,352
You don't need to run off and incorporate as a non-profit right away because you have

908
00:44:19,372 --> 00:44:22,194
to do taxes, you have to be liable to the government.

909
00:44:24,016 --> 00:44:29,301
And there's also a lot of fees associated with incorporating as a non-profit.

910
00:44:29,421 --> 00:44:35,005
So staying as this community grassroots organization is really a good thing.

911
00:44:35,025 --> 00:44:40,830
And you can depend on, especially if you're in a city, I know smaller organizations in

912
00:44:40,850 --> 00:44:42,952
like suburbs and what not might not have.

913
00:44:43,560 --> 00:44:45,562
not be accessible to these things,

914
00:44:45,642 --> 00:44:47,964
but a lot of like co-working spaces,

915
00:44:48,104 --> 00:44:52,488
studios are willing to donate a space for you for free

916
00:44:52,548 --> 00:44:53,889
and you just have to ask them.

917
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,654
And volunteers, a lot of people love to help out

918
00:44:58,674 --> 00:45:00,455
and you need to, if you have them,

919
00:45:00,495 --> 00:45:01,776
you need to appreciate them as well.

920
00:45:03,582 --> 00:45:06,043
Similarly, actually, it's almost contrary to the point,

921
00:45:06,083 --> 00:45:09,665
but at least in Sweden, a number of Chehak and Game Jam

922
00:45:09,685 --> 00:45:13,006
Stockholm are both indebted to a nationwide organization

923
00:45:13,046 --> 00:45:16,788
called Spherock, which it's another non-profit.

924
00:45:17,028 --> 00:45:19,509
It helps support smaller games clubs.

925
00:45:20,170 --> 00:45:23,371
And seeking out bodies like that can actually

926
00:45:23,391 --> 00:45:25,012
be really beneficial because it's.

927
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:34,055
It keeps any potential running costs to zero, which then allows you to keep in members without having to put up a price point.

928
00:45:34,536 --> 00:45:40,318
Because I think having free clubs is a huge part of keeping it socially mobile.

929
00:45:40,598 --> 00:45:44,399
But also they then manage membership data securely and things like that.

930
00:45:44,479 --> 00:45:47,040
All sorts of those kinds of things can be worth seeking out.

931
00:45:48,455 --> 00:45:53,537
Yeah, just a point about what Rob was saying about if you are looking to start a similar

932
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:54,097
initiative.

933
00:45:54,978 --> 00:45:59,419
When I meet people from other cities, a lot of times I hear, like, oh, man, I wish I had

934
00:45:59,439 --> 00:46:00,280
a Dames Making Games.

935
00:46:00,320 --> 00:46:02,060
I wish I had a Pixels.

936
00:46:02,440 --> 00:46:06,482
And I like to remind them, like, what is the bare minimum of these initiatives?

937
00:46:06,502 --> 00:46:07,982
You need a room with some people in it.

938
00:46:08,282 --> 00:46:10,283
And they probably all have their own laptops.

939
00:46:10,403 --> 00:46:11,524
So there you go.

940
00:46:11,584 --> 00:46:12,744
Sometimes you don't even need a room.

941
00:46:12,764 --> 00:46:13,864
You can do it in the park.

942
00:46:13,965 --> 00:46:15,525
But it's basically just a bunch of people.

943
00:46:16,986 --> 00:46:22,574
And, I mean, the difference engine initiatives were actually based on, like, that six-week

944
00:46:22,614 --> 00:46:28,382
model is actually based on the artsy games incubators that the Hand Eye Society, even

945
00:46:28,422 --> 00:46:32,788
before they were incorporated as an organization, the co-founders were running them, and it

946
00:46:32,808 --> 00:46:33,209
was just...

947
00:46:35,438 --> 00:46:41,021
a six week model for giving people space, time and accountability to get a small project

948
00:46:41,061 --> 00:46:41,261
done.

949
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:46,444
So yeah, it was like, let's just find a bar or a library or whatever and once a week for

950
00:46:46,504 --> 00:46:50,526
six weeks we'll meet up and keep each other accountable and show each other what we've

951
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:50,766
done.

952
00:46:50,786 --> 00:46:53,668
And that was sort of basically it.

953
00:46:53,688 --> 00:46:55,429
There was no organization.

954
00:46:55,449 --> 00:46:58,510
It was just, yeah.

955
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,359
That was the sort of minimal thing.

956
00:47:01,499 --> 00:47:03,641
And of course, you can build it from there

957
00:47:03,861 --> 00:47:06,103
until you have larger organizations.

958
00:47:06,203 --> 00:47:09,786
But then that's what people who, you can always come and ask us,

959
00:47:09,826 --> 00:47:11,027
like people who have already done it,

960
00:47:11,928 --> 00:47:14,930
ask for how to build that from that small seed.

961
00:47:15,471 --> 00:47:16,972
The nice thing about that, too, is especially

962
00:47:17,012 --> 00:47:19,674
if you look to any sort of maker space or something,

963
00:47:20,415 --> 00:47:22,316
you'll often find people in that community that

964
00:47:22,356 --> 00:47:25,139
want to get involved with games, that

965
00:47:25,199 --> 00:47:27,300
are doing their own community organization.

966
00:47:27,320 --> 00:47:28,621
And it just kind of spirals up from there.

967
00:47:29,190 --> 00:47:33,971
I mean, every single jam or organization that I've founded

968
00:47:34,031 --> 00:47:36,952
has just been asking for things and being surprised how

969
00:47:37,072 --> 00:47:38,192
helpful people want to be.

970
00:47:38,632 --> 00:47:41,273
Like, it's really people there.

971
00:47:41,353 --> 00:47:43,273
I feel like this issue has hit the point where

972
00:47:43,313 --> 00:47:45,033
I think enough people know that there's

973
00:47:45,093 --> 00:47:47,934
a problem involving representation and in tech.

974
00:47:48,594 --> 00:47:51,635
And there's a lot of people, the question I always hear

975
00:47:51,675 --> 00:47:52,535
is, how can I help?

976
00:47:53,617 --> 00:47:55,620
It sucks when you don't have anything to give those people.

977
00:47:55,660 --> 00:47:56,561
And that's one of the easiest.

978
00:47:56,621 --> 00:47:58,403
It's like, oh, give us some space.

979
00:47:58,463 --> 00:47:59,264
Give us some support.

980
00:47:59,344 --> 00:48:01,466
Or even just signal boosting is super important.

981
00:48:01,486 --> 00:48:03,709
So you can actually reach the people that want to be involved.

982
00:48:04,730 --> 00:48:06,372
And that's one of the biggest things

983
00:48:06,392 --> 00:48:07,874
that I think you get out of that.

984
00:48:08,675 --> 00:48:09,596
Yeah, it's great to feel like.

985
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:11,560
you know, you're no longer starting,

986
00:48:11,740 --> 00:48:13,962
you no longer have to start from scratch or start from zero.

987
00:48:14,022 --> 00:48:15,283
It's like now we are getting to the point

988
00:48:15,323 --> 00:48:17,104
where we're laying that foundation

989
00:48:17,124 --> 00:48:18,866
and it's like kind of historical and awesome.

990
00:48:19,066 --> 00:48:21,728
Yeah, and it's also a thing where a lot of people

991
00:48:22,409 --> 00:48:25,051
who are not necessarily part of the community,

992
00:48:25,751 --> 00:48:27,973
like they're not part of the marginalized group

993
00:48:28,013 --> 00:48:29,774
that's, that they want to help.

994
00:48:30,375 --> 00:48:31,536
One of the big ways that they can help

995
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,817
is to support the people who are leaders in the,

996
00:48:34,258 --> 00:48:35,899
and you know, looking to start these things in.

997
00:48:36,747 --> 00:48:40,510
doing their own thing, to give them platforms or resources.

998
00:48:40,550 --> 00:48:43,572
There's a lot of people doing this really good work already.

999
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:47,395
And another part of that, beyond starting it,

1000
00:48:47,475 --> 00:48:49,817
is seeing support from major institutions,

1001
00:48:50,037 --> 00:48:52,399
or game companies, or people that

1002
00:48:52,439 --> 00:48:54,841
do have the resources that we don't necessarily

1003
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,742
have access to when we're building something from nothing.

1004
00:48:59,904 --> 00:49:01,245
On that note, what are some things

1005
00:49:01,305 --> 00:49:03,087
that game studios and companies can

1006
00:49:03,167 --> 00:49:05,608
implement when they get back to the office next week?

1007
00:49:09,771 --> 00:49:14,915
Well, you can always see what community organizations exist and support them.

1008
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:19,038
You don't have to start from zero, you don't have to start your own thing because these

1009
00:49:19,098 --> 00:49:24,963
communities have already gone through lessons and mistakes and already know what their community

1010
00:49:25,003 --> 00:49:25,403
needs.

1011
00:49:25,904 --> 00:49:31,168
So, going and supporting them, either financially or with resources or with space, is something

1012
00:49:31,248 --> 00:49:32,108
really important.

1013
00:49:34,277 --> 00:49:36,978
Similarly, something that everybody can do, I think,

1014
00:49:37,038 --> 00:49:39,639
is to just start getting educated

1015
00:49:39,699 --> 00:49:41,139
about what the issues even are.

1016
00:49:41,559 --> 00:49:43,580
And the nice thing is, with things

1017
00:49:43,620 --> 00:49:45,301
like Twitter and social media, is

1018
00:49:45,721 --> 00:49:48,522
there's a very non-intrusive way to start learning these things,

1019
00:49:48,562 --> 00:49:51,943
like just quietly going and searching

1020
00:49:51,983 --> 00:49:55,065
for who the big voices are, like the people that

1021
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:56,785
are talking about these issues that have done the work,

1022
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:59,126
and just following their work, and seeing how

1023
00:49:59,186 --> 00:50:01,127
these communities help describe what their own needs are

1024
00:50:01,267 --> 00:50:02,127
in their own words.

1025
00:50:02,527 --> 00:50:03,648
And you can do this without like.

1026
00:50:04,619 --> 00:50:06,680
jumping on somebody and being like, hey, tell me what to do,

1027
00:50:06,760 --> 00:50:08,801
because that can also be really stressful,

1028
00:50:10,141 --> 00:50:12,583
especially if it's just a random person and not someone

1029
00:50:12,603 --> 00:50:13,583
who does this for a living.

1030
00:50:14,083 --> 00:50:16,705
So just quietly observing is a really good step

1031
00:50:16,925 --> 00:50:19,006
one if you're not even sure what the issues actually are

1032
00:50:19,026 --> 00:50:20,227
or what to do or how to help.

1033
00:50:21,028 --> 00:50:24,091
And it's a relatively easy thing to do at events like this.

1034
00:50:25,271 --> 00:50:27,813
One of the major things we do at Divacy at the moment

1035
00:50:27,873 --> 00:50:32,597
is outreach, because Divacy has a network, still building,

1036
00:50:33,057 --> 00:50:35,899
of, like I said, companies and individuals and organizations,

1037
00:50:36,260 --> 00:50:37,560
all working towards the same goal,

1038
00:50:38,221 --> 00:50:41,063
but not necessarily all as one package.

1039
00:50:41,363 --> 00:50:44,145
But when we do come to a conference or something

1040
00:50:44,165 --> 00:50:48,248
like that, then we tend to bring in people from these areas.

1041
00:50:48,588 --> 00:50:52,149
And so it's a matter of just seeking out and talking.

1042
00:50:53,089 --> 00:50:56,010
Just asking questions, I think, is basically it.

1043
00:50:56,430 --> 00:50:58,590
And similarly, there's a whole lot of community leaders.

1044
00:50:58,890 --> 00:51:01,191
Because I think one of the biggest things I hear

1045
00:51:01,831 --> 00:51:05,352
as an excuse for not seeing low representation,

1046
00:51:05,452 --> 00:51:07,592
whether it's panels or in hiring practices,

1047
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:09,552
it's like, well, where do we find them?

1048
00:51:09,632 --> 00:51:10,833
Nobody's applying.

1049
00:51:10,893 --> 00:51:14,113
But to touch on something Sagan mentioned in her presentation,

1050
00:51:14,133 --> 00:51:14,933
you can go to them.

1051
00:51:15,543 --> 00:51:17,344
Like, you can go to these community leaders and be like,

1052
00:51:17,904 --> 00:51:19,985
hey, you know a lot of people.

1053
00:51:20,045 --> 00:51:22,867
Do you know anybody that is really good at this thing?

1054
00:51:23,027 --> 00:51:26,788
And you don't even need to make it a tokenization thing.

1055
00:51:26,828 --> 00:51:28,809
You can just ask who these people's friends are,

1056
00:51:28,829 --> 00:51:30,470
because they probably know somebody amazing.

1057
00:51:30,901 --> 00:51:32,522
Because I think there's a tendency in games

1058
00:51:32,802 --> 00:51:35,263
and a lot of places just hire people we know.

1059
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:38,684
And I think that creates a very self-sustaining culture

1060
00:51:38,704 --> 00:51:39,344
of sameness.

1061
00:51:39,904 --> 00:51:41,885
And it's very easy with all these people

1062
00:51:41,945 --> 00:51:44,826
doing this really great work and doing this activism.

1063
00:51:44,986 --> 00:51:46,887
As you can see, one of the things with the ripple effect

1064
00:51:46,947 --> 00:51:48,928
is look how many of us actually talk to each other

1065
00:51:49,368 --> 00:51:50,068
and know each other.

1066
00:51:50,168 --> 00:51:52,589
So if you need recommendations, it's

1067
00:51:52,629 --> 00:51:54,630
not just look at all this cool work that's coming out.

1068
00:51:54,690 --> 00:51:56,051
It's look at all these people who

1069
00:51:56,171 --> 00:51:59,032
know who the talented people are that you might have not seen

1070
00:51:59,072 --> 00:51:59,852
because, you know.

1071
00:52:00,279 --> 00:52:02,700
social circles don't necessarily always overlap.

1072
00:52:03,040 --> 00:52:04,801
So taking the initiative to be like, hey,

1073
00:52:04,861 --> 00:52:06,882
who do you know that's really good at 3D animation

1074
00:52:06,942 --> 00:52:10,823
or programming that has time and is looking for contract work

1075
00:52:10,843 --> 00:52:13,224
or looking for full-time employment based in this location,

1076
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:16,966
you'll see a better number of people

1077
00:52:17,006 --> 00:52:19,427
that don't necessarily look like you applying for those jobs.

1078
00:52:19,787 --> 00:52:23,209
And similarly, it's really good that there's

1079
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:25,269
a lot of discussion talking about the problems right now,

1080
00:52:25,369 --> 00:52:28,011
but I've definitely seen and talked about this

1081
00:52:28,031 --> 00:52:28,851
with a lot of other people.

1082
00:52:29,617 --> 00:52:33,002
less so about how to actually support the people who are here,

1083
00:52:33,483 --> 00:52:35,766
how to talk about us as more than just a diversity

1084
00:52:35,846 --> 00:52:38,750
checkmark or somebody who has struggled.

1085
00:52:39,991 --> 00:52:41,894
Actually supporting the work that's

1086
00:52:41,934 --> 00:52:44,377
being done, like the games that are being made,

1087
00:52:44,437 --> 00:52:47,001
the cool initiatives, and make no problem.

1088
00:52:47,381 --> 00:52:51,023
Siri, my God, has no chill.

1089
00:52:52,024 --> 00:52:54,065
But actually getting us paid for our work

1090
00:52:54,125 --> 00:52:55,986
is really important and signal boosting that

1091
00:52:56,026 --> 00:52:58,447
because it's like cool to say,

1092
00:52:58,587 --> 00:53:00,308
oh, look at all these things that are being done

1093
00:53:00,328 --> 00:53:01,929
and all these people that are brought into the industry,

1094
00:53:01,949 --> 00:53:03,810
but then the path to sustainability there

1095
00:53:04,270 --> 00:53:05,571
is another core component

1096
00:53:05,591 --> 00:53:07,352
that not enough people are looking at.

1097
00:53:07,832 --> 00:53:09,813
And I would add to that, look in the long term.

1098
00:53:10,313 --> 00:53:11,114
I think if there's one.

1099
00:53:11,774 --> 00:53:19,300
constant thread through our experiences is that diversity initiatives of any kind are long-term reaching you're you're not going to get

1100
00:53:19,821 --> 00:53:23,263
suddenly a diverse community within a month or two

1101
00:53:24,224 --> 00:53:30,169
so investment on the years scale quite often because it is a slow process and

1102
00:53:30,249 --> 00:53:36,394
Similarly a beginning game developer is going to have different problems like breaking into the industry just getting the basic skill set

1103
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:38,996
There's like a whole other arena of mentorship that

1104
00:53:39,652 --> 00:53:43,094
something I'm trying to step up with more like I'm actually people's agent now like I'm just

1105
00:53:43,114 --> 00:53:50,840
like a freelance princess Carolyn for yelling at you about why your contract sucks or why

1106
00:53:50,901 --> 00:53:55,084
you don't have a contract at all like even just teaching things like how to negotiate what to

1107
00:53:55,184 --> 00:54:00,608
ask for in a contract the fact that you can push back on a contract because oh my god the number

1108
00:54:00,628 --> 00:54:05,132
of starting independent developers especially people who don't look like the traditional

1109
00:54:05,152 --> 00:54:05,612
developer.

1110
00:54:06,025 --> 00:54:09,548
they don't know they can negotiate on these things. They are just so happy to be here in the

1111
00:54:09,588 --> 00:54:15,593
first place. That's something that experienced devs and veterans can do. Even if you write a

1112
00:54:15,633 --> 00:54:20,696
piece or put the stuff out there. Internet is awesome. We can say, hey, just so you know,

1113
00:54:20,756 --> 00:54:26,821
have you even thought about what your terms of your contract are or do you need or reaching

1114
00:54:26,861 --> 00:54:31,084
out to people in that middle range where they have made a couple games. They haven't had

1115
00:54:31,104 --> 00:54:32,405
their big hit or anything yet.

1116
00:54:32,809 --> 00:54:35,830
Maybe they don't have contacts at PlayStation or Nintendo

1117
00:54:36,010 --> 00:54:39,191
or sending an email even just for people like that.

1118
00:54:39,231 --> 00:54:41,192
Like that really minor mentorship,

1119
00:54:41,732 --> 00:54:43,952
that can do everything for someone

1120
00:54:43,972 --> 00:54:45,493
who's trying to build their own thing

1121
00:54:45,533 --> 00:54:47,813
and not just be able to make games,

1122
00:54:47,853 --> 00:54:49,814
but be able to do that full time and sustainably.

1123
00:54:50,406 --> 00:54:53,671
I'm very excited that we're getting to the point where, because we've done a number of

1124
00:54:54,352 --> 00:54:57,817
like first-time game maker type things, and now it's getting to the point where it's like,

1125
00:54:57,858 --> 00:55:01,283
well, we have, we've done so many of them that we have all these people that have gone

1126
00:55:01,303 --> 00:55:03,667
through that program, made their first game, and they're like, now what?

1127
00:55:03,807 --> 00:55:04,468
Now what do I do?

1128
00:55:04,688 --> 00:55:05,410
What's a contract?

1129
00:55:05,938 --> 00:55:09,880
how do I go from here? And now I'm excited to like start doing

1130
00:55:09,900 --> 00:55:12,741
those like more intermediate level support jams and stuff

1131
00:55:12,941 --> 00:55:16,342
like how do you go from there to like making a career or a

1132
00:55:16,402 --> 00:55:19,904
vocation out of this if that's the path that you want to go on.

1133
00:55:19,944 --> 00:55:22,525
So that's kind of like what I'm planning to work on next with

1134
00:55:22,545 --> 00:55:26,567
the Hand Eye Society. That's awesome.

1135
00:55:26,587 --> 00:55:29,108
We're definitely with Pexels we're definitely reaching that

1136
00:55:29,168 --> 00:55:32,309
point where we need to start offering like support to mid

1137
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:32,749
level beginner.

1138
00:55:34,147 --> 00:55:40,051
developers because they needed to, they need to, like, not be part of the leaky pipeline

1139
00:55:40,091 --> 00:55:46,335
problem. They need support that is kind of away from the studios. They just need a place

1140
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:52,359
to go to talk, as Zoe said. And it's really important that we start examining these needs

1141
00:55:52,419 --> 00:55:53,160
in our communities.

1142
00:55:55,141 --> 00:56:00,364
And I just want to say one quick thing about, like, experience and reminding

1143
00:56:01,187 --> 00:56:05,369
sort of everyone of, you know, how I came into this leadership role wasn't because I

1144
00:56:05,629 --> 00:56:06,990
already knew how to be a leader.

1145
00:56:07,030 --> 00:56:10,412
Like I had never done any of this stuff when they first asked me to run that workshop.

1146
00:56:10,772 --> 00:56:13,933
They asked me to run a game making workshop and I didn't know really how to make a game

1147
00:56:13,973 --> 00:56:16,975
still and it worked out amazingly.

1148
00:56:17,655 --> 00:56:19,577
And when they asked me to be executive director,

1149
00:56:19,617 --> 00:56:21,038
I had no nonprofit experience.

1150
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:22,519
But they were like, you know what, it's more important

1151
00:56:22,539 --> 00:56:24,640
that you're in the community, that you know about,

1152
00:56:24,840 --> 00:56:26,481
you understand video games, and you understand

1153
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:27,082
this community.

1154
00:56:27,642 --> 00:56:28,903
The other stuff we can teach you,

1155
00:56:29,563 --> 00:56:30,784
and we can mentor you through that.

1156
00:56:30,844 --> 00:56:34,086
And this was like a lot of men saying this to me,

1157
00:56:34,106 --> 00:56:36,468
a lot of men propping me up and supporting me,

1158
00:56:36,488 --> 00:56:38,789
and that was like, that meant an incredible lot.

1159
00:56:39,850 --> 00:56:42,232
Yeah, similarly, it goes beyond just like,

1160
00:56:42,672 --> 00:56:44,333
sustainable business stuff too, but also like,

1161
00:56:44,353 --> 00:56:45,053
how we talk about.

1162
00:56:45,413 --> 00:56:47,294
of games and what is getting visibility,

1163
00:56:47,334 --> 00:56:48,936
especially if you're an indie game maker,

1164
00:56:49,076 --> 00:56:50,917
you probably know that visibility is life or death

1165
00:56:51,438 --> 00:56:52,318
in terms of your business.

1166
00:56:53,119 --> 00:56:56,702
So making sure that, for instance, on award juries,

1167
00:56:56,762 --> 00:57:00,044
it's not just all people that look exactly the same.

1168
00:57:00,525 --> 00:57:03,307
That's people with a diverse range of not just backgrounds,

1169
00:57:03,387 --> 00:57:05,649
but ideally creative tastes as well.

1170
00:57:06,369 --> 00:57:10,613
It's not just five AAA guys, but a variety

1171
00:57:10,653 --> 00:57:12,574
of people from different backgrounds with different

1172
00:57:12,974 --> 00:57:13,155
you know.

1173
00:57:14,683 --> 00:57:15,544
views on things.

1174
00:57:16,264 --> 00:57:18,564
Because a lived experience is experience.

1175
00:57:18,844 --> 00:57:19,304
Exactly.

1176
00:57:19,324 --> 00:57:20,565
It's expertise, really.

1177
00:57:20,865 --> 00:57:25,546
And making sure that it's a holistic approach, not just

1178
00:57:26,306 --> 00:57:28,386
how do we get them to start their own business, but what

1179
00:57:28,406 --> 00:57:30,727
are we doing to highlight them and to support them.

1180
00:57:32,327 --> 00:57:33,527
We're actually out of time.

1181
00:57:34,687 --> 00:57:34,947
Quick.

1182
00:57:37,528 --> 00:57:39,188
So thank you, everyone, for coming.

1183
00:57:39,688 --> 00:57:42,509
If you appreciated what you heard today, please fill out

1184
00:57:42,529 --> 00:57:43,709
the speaker evaluations.

1185
00:57:46,150 --> 00:57:46,337
Thank you.
