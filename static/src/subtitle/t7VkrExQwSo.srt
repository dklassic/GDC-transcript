1
00:00:11,671 --> 00:00:15,993
Hi everyone, thank you very much for coming to my talk on Environment Design as Visual

2
00:00:15,993 --> 00:00:22,957
Storytelling. So before we get into the talk proper, a little bit about myself. So my name

3
00:00:22,957 --> 00:00:27,940
is Miriam Bellard and I'm the Art Director for Visual Development at Rockstar Games.

4
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:32,563
So I have a background in architecture and film as well as video games.

5
00:00:32,903 --> 00:00:39,825
So I hold a first class honours degree in architecture from Auckland University in New Zealand.

6
00:00:39,825 --> 00:00:43,246
The highlight of my film career would have been as a set designer on King Kong.

7
00:00:43,246 --> 00:00:46,647
So that was a Peter Jackson film filmed in New Zealand.

8
00:00:46,647 --> 00:00:51,809
And the highlight of my video game career is most definitely my current job at Rockstar.

9
00:00:52,349 --> 00:00:58,235
However, I haven't just worked on big budget and triple A. I started my film career working on

10
00:00:58,235 --> 00:01:03,340
short films, music videos, and low budget productions. And I started my video game

11
00:01:03,340 --> 00:01:08,165
career at an indie studio, and I returned to indie work in the middle of my career as well.

12
00:01:08,165 --> 00:01:13,830
So this talk isn't just aimed at big budget and triple A. This talk is aimed at everybody.

13
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:19,302
Within Rockstar, I lead a team of visual development artists,

14
00:01:19,302 --> 00:01:22,063
and they all come from similar backgrounds to myself.

15
00:01:22,063 --> 00:01:24,425
So architecture, interior design, film set design,

16
00:01:24,425 --> 00:01:26,986
concept art, things like that.

17
00:01:28,113 --> 00:01:31,395
This is the type of work that my team does.

18
00:01:31,395 --> 00:01:34,377
So our focus is on environment pre-production.

19
00:01:34,377 --> 00:01:37,159
So we're doing architectural layouts,

20
00:01:37,159 --> 00:01:41,541
set dressing passes, reference boards, and so on.

21
00:01:41,541 --> 00:01:45,124
So our role as a department is to make sure

22
00:01:45,124 --> 00:01:47,605
that designs are going to work for everybody.

23
00:01:47,605 --> 00:01:49,786
So they need to work for game design,

24
00:01:49,786 --> 00:01:53,129
for environment art, for art direction,

25
00:01:53,129 --> 00:01:56,811
for animation AI, the narrative team, and so on.

26
00:01:58,659 --> 00:02:03,081
So this talk is a companion talk to one that I did a couple of years ago now,

27
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:07,724
and that talk was on environment design and spatial cinematography.

28
00:02:07,724 --> 00:02:13,888
So when you are designing, you need to design for a number of different criteria. You need to design

29
00:02:13,888 --> 00:02:19,252
for spatial cinematography, but also visual storytelling, which I'm going over today.

30
00:02:20,072 --> 00:02:23,434
player interaction, aesthetics, and practicalities.

31
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:28,137
So a good design is going to take all of these into account.

32
00:02:28,137 --> 00:02:31,599
Sometimes we do need to make some compromises,

33
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,141
but it all needs to work.

34
00:02:34,141 --> 00:02:36,422
So moving on to the talk proper,

35
00:02:36,422 --> 00:02:39,504
so environment design as visual storytelling.

36
00:02:39,504 --> 00:02:41,545
So a good way to get into this

37
00:02:41,545 --> 00:02:43,807
is to think about our role here.

38
00:02:43,807 --> 00:02:45,328
So we are very much like

39
00:02:45,709 --> 00:02:50,733
actors and actresses in that we are playing a part in creating a character.

40
00:02:50,733 --> 00:02:57,838
The biggest difference between us and actors and actresses is the medium that we have to work in.

41
00:02:57,838 --> 00:03:01,740
So they are working with their own bodies and their own physicality,

42
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:05,863
whereas we are using the environment in order to create our characters.

43
00:03:07,553 --> 00:03:11,396
So the talk today is going to be a very fast-paced talk.

44
00:03:11,396 --> 00:03:14,458
I'm going to be going over quite a lot of different points.

45
00:03:14,458 --> 00:03:18,121
This is very much a broad overview.

46
00:03:18,121 --> 00:03:21,124
Those points are going to be grouped into four sections.

47
00:03:21,124 --> 00:03:23,105
So we have mimesis,

48
00:03:23,105 --> 00:03:25,547
which is all about mimicking and copying reality.

49
00:03:26,148 --> 00:03:32,053
semiotics, which is all about signs and symbols and how we communicate, cognition, which is about

50
00:03:32,053 --> 00:03:37,397
neuroscience and psychology, and then we're going to end on some aspects of the structure

51
00:03:37,397 --> 00:03:41,541
of your visual storytelling. Now for advanced people in the audience,

52
00:03:41,541 --> 00:03:46,204
some aspects of the Mimesis section are going to be a little bit basic for you,

53
00:03:46,204 --> 00:03:51,068
but I ask if you'll just bear with me because there'll be more for you in other sections.

54
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:55,853
So if you want to know more when the talk's over,

55
00:03:55,853 --> 00:03:59,276
I will be putting a bibliography up on my website

56
00:03:59,276 --> 00:04:02,419
that will cover not just the references

57
00:04:02,419 --> 00:04:04,701
that I'm going to bring up during this talk,

58
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:08,284
but also other things on the topic as well.

59
00:04:08,284 --> 00:04:12,408
So, starting now with mimesis.

60
00:04:12,408 --> 00:04:15,150
So this is all about mimicking and copying reality.

61
00:04:15,829 --> 00:04:19,352
So a good way to start here is with role-playing.

62
00:04:19,352 --> 00:04:22,115
So when you're engaging with a design,

63
00:04:22,115 --> 00:04:25,818
you want to think about who are the characters

64
00:04:25,818 --> 00:04:27,219
that were involved?

65
00:04:27,219 --> 00:04:30,382
What resources did they have to hand?

66
00:04:30,382 --> 00:04:31,724
What was their taste?

67
00:04:31,724 --> 00:04:33,785
What was their interest?

68
00:04:33,785 --> 00:04:35,547
What was the fashion at the time?

69
00:04:35,547 --> 00:04:37,088
And then who came later?

70
00:04:37,088 --> 00:04:39,911
What were their needs, their tastes, their interests?

71
00:04:40,191 --> 00:04:43,094
what environmental factors were in play as well.

72
00:04:43,094 --> 00:04:46,638
And so you really want to think through all the different layers of history

73
00:04:46,638 --> 00:04:48,880
and all the different characters.

74
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,025
Now, sometimes that will lead you to designing something like this,

75
00:04:53,025 --> 00:04:55,908
which is, of course, a piece of contemporary architecture.

76
00:04:56,248 --> 00:05:01,671
but more often than not we're going to be designing something that looks much more old-fashioned and

77
00:05:01,671 --> 00:05:08,815
historic or that looks completely undesigned. So here the storytelling is, you know, an underground

78
00:05:08,815 --> 00:05:13,877
bunker space, it's not supposed to look architecturally designed, so even though it was

79
00:05:13,877 --> 00:05:19,240
designed by an architect we can't make it look like that. Again, we are actors and actresses

80
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,521
and we're playing a part.

81
00:05:22,185 --> 00:05:25,768
So all the images I'm going to be showing you today

82
00:05:25,768 --> 00:05:28,610
are all from GTA 5 or GTA 5 Online DLC.

83
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:31,772
That is, I should say, all the in-game images.

84
00:05:31,772 --> 00:05:34,414
So next, under mimesis, so again,

85
00:05:34,414 --> 00:05:37,837
mimesis is all about mimicking and copying reality.

86
00:05:37,837 --> 00:05:39,618
Next, we have personality.

87
00:05:39,618 --> 00:05:41,660
So this book here,

88
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:45,703
which is by an environmental psychologist,

89
00:05:45,703 --> 00:05:50,446
he talks about how your personality is portrayed in a space.

90
00:05:50,707 --> 00:05:54,628
So he talks about behavioral traces, identity claims, and mood modifiers.

91
00:05:54,628 --> 00:06:01,251
So behavioral traces are the traces that you leave behind in an environment as you use that

92
00:06:01,251 --> 00:06:08,514
environment. So they are of course things like mess and clutter, but it's also things like a

93
00:06:08,514 --> 00:06:17,258
couch or a chair under a window or next to a lamp because somebody is using it to read or to write.

94
00:06:22,074 --> 00:06:26,639
So next, under personality, we have identity claims.

95
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,581
So identity claims are the claims

96
00:06:28,581 --> 00:06:30,423
that people are making about themselves,

97
00:06:30,423 --> 00:06:32,285
and that can be self-directed,

98
00:06:32,285 --> 00:06:35,048
so you could be reminding yourself who you are,

99
00:06:35,048 --> 00:06:36,810
or it can be other-directed,

100
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:38,792
so you're letting other people know who you are.

101
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:43,029
So they are, of course, things like photographs on the wall

102
00:06:43,029 --> 00:06:47,010
or certificates, but it's also things like your choice

103
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,891
of artwork that you have up

104
00:06:48,891 --> 00:06:50,771
or the types of objects that you have up.

105
00:06:50,771 --> 00:06:54,432
So are you somebody who has authentic,

106
00:06:54,432 --> 00:06:56,953
traditional arcade cabinets,

107
00:06:56,953 --> 00:07:00,874
or are you somebody who has a modern reinvention

108
00:07:00,874 --> 00:07:03,295
of an arcade cabinet to show how modern

109
00:07:03,295 --> 00:07:04,495
and cutting edge you are?

110
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,592
So next under personality, we have mood modifiers.

111
00:07:08,592 --> 00:07:11,214
So these are things that people are doing

112
00:07:11,214 --> 00:07:12,755
in order to adjust their mood.

113
00:07:12,755 --> 00:07:16,218
So a lot of this is happening in the audio

114
00:07:16,218 --> 00:07:19,460
in terms of the music that people choose to play,

115
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:22,122
but it's also happening in the visuals as well.

116
00:07:22,122 --> 00:07:25,324
So it can be things like candles or incense

117
00:07:25,324 --> 00:07:28,446
or the colors that people choose to paint their walls.

118
00:07:28,446 --> 00:07:31,168
Now, it's not just about being calming.

119
00:07:31,168 --> 00:07:34,490
It can also be about amping up the volume as well.

120
00:07:36,102 --> 00:07:39,444
So next under mimesis, so mimicking and copying reality,

121
00:07:39,444 --> 00:07:41,505
we have affordances.

122
00:07:41,505 --> 00:07:45,928
So affordances are the actions that an object allows.

123
00:07:45,928 --> 00:07:48,830
So a chair affords sitting, a car affords driving,

124
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,751
and a door affords opening.

125
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,652
So we normally think about affordances

126
00:07:52,652 --> 00:07:55,754
in terms of interactivity and gameplay.

127
00:07:55,754 --> 00:07:59,577
However, affordances have storytelling components as well.

128
00:07:59,577 --> 00:08:02,499
So to start out with an extreme example,

129
00:08:02,499 --> 00:08:05,521
so let's say you have a cellar.

130
00:08:06,021 --> 00:08:10,304
And in one version of that cellar, you have a torture chair,

131
00:08:10,304 --> 00:08:13,226
and in another version, you have wine barrels.

132
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:14,887
Now, as I'm sure you're aware,

133
00:08:14,887 --> 00:08:16,748
the storytelling is going to be very,

134
00:08:16,748 --> 00:08:18,309
very different in those two.

135
00:08:18,309 --> 00:08:21,971
Now, that is the case even if the torture chair

136
00:08:21,971 --> 00:08:24,253
and the wine barrels are not actually functional

137
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:25,033
in your game.

138
00:08:25,033 --> 00:08:27,655
It's the affordances from the real world

139
00:08:27,655 --> 00:08:30,016
that are adding the storytelling.

140
00:08:31,432 --> 00:08:33,453
So to take a less extreme example,

141
00:08:33,453 --> 00:08:37,515
let's say in one space we have a lot of furniture

142
00:08:37,515 --> 00:08:39,877
and in the other we don't have any.

143
00:08:39,877 --> 00:08:42,698
So the affordances of furniture are of course

144
00:08:42,698 --> 00:08:45,080
that it's there for human use.

145
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,641
You can sit in chairs and you can be comfortable.

146
00:08:47,842 --> 00:08:53,388
So that is the storytelling that it's adding to the space, the sense of welcome that the space

147
00:08:53,388 --> 00:09:02,017
is for humans, and that sense of comfort as well. Now that is the case again, even if those are not

148
00:09:02,017 --> 00:09:07,864
functional in your game, this is about the affordances from the real world, that's what's

149
00:09:07,864 --> 00:09:09,165
providing the storytelling.

150
00:09:11,003 --> 00:09:14,685
So next under mimesis, so mimicking and copying reality,

151
00:09:14,685 --> 00:09:16,206
we have sizes.

152
00:09:16,206 --> 00:09:20,768
So sizes affect how we see the materials and structure.

153
00:09:20,768 --> 00:09:22,970
So here with these two bridges,

154
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:26,311
a steel bridge is going to have very different sizes

155
00:09:26,311 --> 00:09:29,173
and spans in comparison to a masonry bridge.

156
00:09:29,692 --> 00:09:34,075
However, if I look at a slightly more subtle example,

157
00:09:34,075 --> 00:09:38,158
so on the left, you are looking at the steel structure

158
00:09:38,158 --> 00:09:41,380
that's in a tunnel leading to a missile silo,

159
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:44,542
and in the right, that's the steel structure

160
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:45,583
for an airplane hanger.

161
00:09:46,410 --> 00:09:52,912
Now the structure on the left is much thicker and much chunkier because it has to withstand the

162
00:09:52,912 --> 00:09:58,393
shaking from the missile when it takes off. So again the different sizes here are communicating

163
00:09:58,393 --> 00:10:06,695
the different functions. So sizes also affect how we see the characters. So to start out with stair

164
00:10:06,695 --> 00:10:11,876
sizes, so these are normal stair sizes and the character looks very normal.

165
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:16,621
However, these here are oversized stairs.

166
00:10:16,621 --> 00:10:19,841
And the effect that oversized stairs does

167
00:10:19,841 --> 00:10:24,022
is it makes these characters look small and weak

168
00:10:24,022 --> 00:10:27,303
and childlike as they're climbing up the stairs.

169
00:10:27,303 --> 00:10:29,864
Now, it's perfectly acceptable to do this

170
00:10:29,864 --> 00:10:31,344
if that's your intention.

171
00:10:31,344 --> 00:10:34,045
If you want your characters to look small and weak,

172
00:10:34,045 --> 00:10:36,725
then by all means have oversized stairs.

173
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,506
But quite often in game,

174
00:10:38,926 --> 00:10:42,528
we have, if not heroic characters, at least powerful characters,

175
00:10:42,528 --> 00:10:46,650
and the last thing we want to do is to make them look small and weak.

176
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:53,634
So, as a public service announcement, the size of stairs is in proportion to a human stride.

177
00:10:53,634 --> 00:11:00,238
As the rise gets higher, the run gets shorter, because it's the rise and run together

178
00:11:00,238 --> 00:11:04,320
that are in proportion to a human stride.

179
00:11:04,848 --> 00:11:07,370
So there are equations for this online.

180
00:11:07,370 --> 00:11:09,450
This is just one from Wikipedia.

181
00:11:09,450 --> 00:11:11,271
So interestingly enough,

182
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,972
you could take the stride length here,

183
00:11:13,972 --> 00:11:15,773
the human stride length,

184
00:11:15,773 --> 00:11:18,414
and you could replace it with the stride length

185
00:11:18,414 --> 00:11:22,476
of say a dwarf or a giant or another non-human race.

186
00:11:22,476 --> 00:11:25,037
And in doing so, you could actually make stairs

187
00:11:25,037 --> 00:11:28,859
that were correctly proportioned for non-human races

188
00:11:28,859 --> 00:11:30,360
for sci-fi and fantasy games.

189
00:11:31,733 --> 00:11:35,195
So this isn't just about stair sizes,

190
00:11:35,195 --> 00:11:40,397
this is anything that is about human ergonomics

191
00:11:40,397 --> 00:11:42,538
and human proportions and anatomy.

192
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:46,019
So it's things like chair heights, table heights,

193
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:48,860
desk heights, counter heights, bar heights,

194
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:49,621
that kind of thing.

195
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:51,681
If you have any of those too big,

196
00:11:51,681 --> 00:11:55,123
what you're going to do is create this kind of mini me

197
00:11:55,123 --> 00:11:56,563
effect on the character.

198
00:11:57,354 --> 00:12:00,896
Now this can actually be a bit of a practical problem.

199
00:12:00,896 --> 00:12:04,518
So if we look here at the first picture on the left,

200
00:12:04,518 --> 00:12:08,480
that chair is 100% real-world size.

201
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,542
In many games, that is going to look too small.

202
00:12:12,542 --> 00:12:15,063
It's just not going to have enough presence on screen.

203
00:12:15,063 --> 00:12:16,464
Whereas the middle one.

204
00:12:16,842 --> 00:12:19,724
We've enlarged that, but that is now

205
00:12:19,724 --> 00:12:22,566
having this mini-me effect on the character.

206
00:12:22,566 --> 00:12:25,248
However, the one on the right, what we've done

207
00:12:25,248 --> 00:12:28,091
is we've scaled the width and scaled the depth,

208
00:12:28,091 --> 00:12:30,673
but we've kept the height at 100% real world.

209
00:12:30,673 --> 00:12:34,576
And so that is giving us more on-screen presence,

210
00:12:34,576 --> 00:12:37,458
but it's not having the mini-me effect on the character.

211
00:12:37,458 --> 00:12:42,062
So next, under mimesis, so this section

212
00:12:42,062 --> 00:12:44,924
was all about mimicking and copying reality.

213
00:12:44,924 --> 00:12:46,205
Next, we have layout.

214
00:12:46,858 --> 00:12:53,143
So if we look at these two buildings here, the first one is a US building from the early 1900s,

215
00:12:53,143 --> 00:13:00,129
the second is a UK building from the 1800s. So there are a lot of differences between them.

216
00:13:00,129 --> 00:13:07,314
So obviously one's freestanding, the other is a row house, one has wood, one's made out of brick,

217
00:13:07,314 --> 00:13:12,218
they've got different cells, windows and doors and so on. But another extremely important

218
00:13:12,218 --> 00:13:16,182
difference is their layout. So that first house you're entering

219
00:13:16,599 --> 00:13:21,320
directly into the lounge, and you have this very interconnected layout.

220
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:26,382
Whereas the second one, you enter into the corridor, and the corridor and the stairs

221
00:13:26,382 --> 00:13:31,443
create a linear spine through the building, and everything comes off the corridors.

222
00:13:31,443 --> 00:13:37,385
Now if you were to mix up those two, and if you had that corridor in the very first one,

223
00:13:37,385 --> 00:13:41,486
you would completely undermine the visual storytelling of that space.

224
00:13:42,007 --> 00:13:48,536
So it's just as important the same way that you would research, say, things like the style

225
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:53,543
of doors and windows that would go in a particular style of building, you also need to research

226
00:13:53,543 --> 00:13:55,365
the layout for that style of building.

227
00:13:56,990 --> 00:14:00,532
Now I'm going to take a slight tangent for a second.

228
00:14:00,532 --> 00:14:03,693
So if you remember, right at the beginning of the talk,

229
00:14:03,693 --> 00:14:05,753
I spoke about how we need to design

230
00:14:05,753 --> 00:14:07,414
for multiple different criteria,

231
00:14:07,414 --> 00:14:10,815
and not just visual storytelling.

232
00:14:10,815 --> 00:14:13,916
Well, it's very possible that a layout like this

233
00:14:13,916 --> 00:14:16,177
would have issues when it comes to

234
00:14:16,177 --> 00:14:18,918
both the spatial cinematography side

235
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:25,363
and also the player interaction side because a linear layout like this with lots of dead ends

236
00:14:25,363 --> 00:14:31,849
is going to mean lots of turning around for the player and lots of stopping and starting

237
00:14:31,849 --> 00:14:38,115
and it's not going to be very fluid movement. So what we would probably do or look at doing

238
00:14:38,115 --> 00:14:43,620
in a space like this, again depending on the gameplay of course, but more than likely we're

239
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:44,981
going to be end up

240
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:50,136
adding some extra doors in order to create looping layouts.

241
00:14:50,136 --> 00:14:52,998
Now, this of course does undermine

242
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,240
this visual storytelling to some extent,

243
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:58,603
but what we're trying to do is we're trying to make things

244
00:14:58,603 --> 00:15:00,964
work for the other criteria as well

245
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:02,686
and have as little impact here

246
00:15:02,686 --> 00:15:05,008
on the visual storytelling as we can.

247
00:15:05,008 --> 00:15:08,110
So what we're not going to do is we're not going to walk,

248
00:15:08,110 --> 00:15:10,112
we're not going to change this

249
00:15:10,112 --> 00:15:12,213
into a completely open planned layout.

250
00:15:12,553 --> 00:15:15,936
we're not going to walk directly into the lounge like the other one,

251
00:15:15,936 --> 00:15:20,418
we're just going to make as small and as subtle changes as possible

252
00:15:20,418 --> 00:15:21,759
in order to make this work.

253
00:15:23,407 --> 00:15:29,632
So to sum up now the Mimisa section. So this section was all about mimicking and copying reality.

254
00:15:29,632 --> 00:15:35,337
We had role-playing, which is thinking through our different characters and the layers of history.

255
00:15:35,337 --> 00:15:42,643
Personality was all about identity claims, mood modifiers, and I have forgotten one of them.

256
00:15:42,643 --> 00:15:49,648
Behavioral traces, that's right. Affordances, that's the actions that an object allows.

257
00:15:50,049 --> 00:15:57,671
and that the real-world affordances affects the in-game storytelling, sizes affect how we see

258
00:15:57,671 --> 00:16:03,173
materials and structure, and also how we see the characters, and finally it's as important

259
00:16:03,173 --> 00:16:06,475
to research your layout as any other aspect of a design.

260
00:16:07,785 --> 00:16:10,726
So next up we're going to talk about semiotics.

261
00:16:10,726 --> 00:16:13,627
So semiotics are all about signs and symbols

262
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,527
and how we communicate.

263
00:16:15,527 --> 00:16:17,708
So a good introduction to semiotics

264
00:16:17,708 --> 00:16:20,048
is this painting by Magritte.

265
00:16:20,048 --> 00:16:22,409
So what the text on this painting says

266
00:16:22,409 --> 00:16:23,909
is this is not a pipe.

267
00:16:23,909 --> 00:16:26,050
That is entirely accurate.

268
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:27,450
This is not a pipe.

269
00:16:27,854 --> 00:16:30,096
this is a painting of a pipe.

270
00:16:30,096 --> 00:16:32,518
In fact, if I'm going to be particularly pedantic,

271
00:16:32,518 --> 00:16:37,382
this is a digital representation of a painting of a pipe.

272
00:16:37,382 --> 00:16:40,044
Now Magritte was very interested in semiotics

273
00:16:40,044 --> 00:16:42,726
and this actually was what he was referring to here.

274
00:16:42,726 --> 00:16:45,388
So at its heart with semiotics,

275
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:48,271
we have signifiers and what is signified.

276
00:16:48,271 --> 00:16:52,074
So the painting here is a signifier

277
00:16:52,074 --> 00:16:55,537
and what it is signifying is the pipe itself.

278
00:16:56,706 --> 00:17:00,428
So we have a number of different types of signifiers.

279
00:17:00,428 --> 00:17:03,369
We have symbols, icons, and indexes.

280
00:17:03,369 --> 00:17:07,931
So before I get into actually explaining these,

281
00:17:07,931 --> 00:17:09,932
I just to point out to the more advanced people

282
00:17:09,932 --> 00:17:12,313
in the audience that the examples I'm going

283
00:17:12,313 --> 00:17:14,354
to be giving here, all of them are things

284
00:17:14,354 --> 00:17:16,475
that you're familiar with already.

285
00:17:16,475 --> 00:17:18,717
So what's new or useful here

286
00:17:18,917 --> 00:17:24,424
is actually the words and the structure in order to explain what it is that we're doing already

287
00:17:24,424 --> 00:17:29,131
rather than adding anything new here in terms of actual practice.

288
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:35,219
So a symbol signifier is a signifier that is culturally arbitrary and needs to be learned.

289
00:17:35,717 --> 00:17:42,023
So language is the classic example here. So in order to understand that the English word rose

290
00:17:42,023 --> 00:17:48,028
means a rose, we need to understand English. You know, we can't just figure that out. I can't look

291
00:17:48,028 --> 00:17:53,173
at any of those words from the other languages and know that they mean a rose.

292
00:17:54,119 --> 00:17:57,422
In terms of visuals, something like a traffic light

293
00:17:57,422 --> 00:17:59,883
would be an example of a symbol signifier.

294
00:17:59,883 --> 00:18:02,545
Again, this is culturally arbitrary.

295
00:18:02,545 --> 00:18:03,686
You need to learn it.

296
00:18:03,686 --> 00:18:06,488
You can't just guess by looking at the traffic light

297
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,009
what it means.

298
00:18:08,009 --> 00:18:09,911
So in terms of in-game examples.

299
00:18:10,031 --> 00:18:15,977
So texts and plaques and things like that that we have in game are examples of symbol signifiers.

300
00:18:15,977 --> 00:18:23,784
And when we use logos and cultural references in the game, those are all symbol signifiers as well.

301
00:18:23,784 --> 00:18:28,348
And so the more the player understands the cultural references,

302
00:18:28,348 --> 00:18:31,792
the more the player will understand the signifier.

303
00:18:32,866 --> 00:18:35,868
So an icon signifier is a signifier

304
00:18:35,868 --> 00:18:39,231
that physically resembles what it is signifying.

305
00:18:39,231 --> 00:18:40,652
So male and female icons,

306
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,635
and also, of course, this picture by Magritte.

307
00:18:44,635 --> 00:18:48,278
So the painting itself was an icon signifier,

308
00:18:48,278 --> 00:18:50,560
and again, what it was signifying was the pipe.

309
00:18:50,560 --> 00:18:53,722
So the painting looks like the pipe,

310
00:18:53,722 --> 00:18:55,163
which is what makes it an icon.

311
00:18:55,163 --> 00:18:58,466
So icon signifiers would be the most common

312
00:18:58,466 --> 00:19:00,027
type of signifier in game.

313
00:19:01,044 --> 00:19:09,113
So here we've looked to what modern contemporary casinos look like and

314
00:19:09,113 --> 00:19:14,539
contemporary hotels and we've applied that knowledge to the design of this building.

315
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:19,764
So this building simply looks like a modern casino and so that would be the most common

316
00:19:19,764 --> 00:19:21,306
type of signifier in game.

317
00:19:22,732 --> 00:19:28,133
So an index signifier is a signifier where we have a linked or causal relationship

318
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:35,114
between the signifier and the signified. So here the smoke is an index signifier

319
00:19:35,114 --> 00:19:40,055
and what is signified is the fire that's causing the smoke. So an in-game example would be all the

320
00:19:40,055 --> 00:19:46,096
money and drugs and alcohol that you're seeing lying around here. All of those are index signifiers

321
00:19:46,096 --> 00:19:51,377
which communicate what the player and the characters have been doing.

322
00:19:52,642 --> 00:20:00,644
So to move away from theory for a second and to talk just about practice, we have the concept

323
00:20:00,644 --> 00:20:02,745
of aesthetic language.

324
00:20:02,745 --> 00:20:07,266
So most of you are going to be familiar with the term shape language.

325
00:20:07,266 --> 00:20:10,847
So by aesthetic language, I am meaning something a bit broader.

326
00:20:10,847 --> 00:20:13,508
However, let's start with shape language to begin with.

327
00:20:14,229 --> 00:20:19,830
So you will also be familiar, I'm sure, with the use of shape language in sci-fi and fantasy,

328
00:20:19,830 --> 00:20:27,952
where you might, say, have round shapes that you associate with the buildings and the vehicle designs and so on of one particular race,

329
00:20:27,952 --> 00:20:31,833
and then sharp angular shapes that you associate with another race.

330
00:20:31,833 --> 00:20:37,334
And by having different shapes for different races, it makes it easy to tell them apart.

331
00:20:37,334 --> 00:20:41,475
Well, you can use shape language in realistic designs as well.

332
00:20:42,016 --> 00:20:48,741
So let's say we were designing either some art deco moldings or some colonial moldings.

333
00:20:48,741 --> 00:20:54,765
What you could do in order to design moldings that fit within those styles but that were

334
00:20:54,765 --> 00:20:58,408
fresh new moldings is you could look to the shapes of those moldings

335
00:20:58,761 --> 00:21:02,725
understand those shapes and then do something in the same language.

336
00:21:02,725 --> 00:21:06,608
So with the Art Deco ones you're looking at the fact that they're made out of

337
00:21:06,608 --> 00:21:12,373
rectangle squares and simple curves and the colonial ones are of course much more complex shapes.

338
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:17,980
And so that is the way we've approached this design here.

339
00:21:17,980 --> 00:21:27,230
So this brutalist design on the right looked to existing and proposed real-world brutalist designs

340
00:21:27,230 --> 00:21:31,535
and it didn't copy any of them, it didn't copy any particular parts.

341
00:21:31,875 --> 00:21:37,561
What it did was it looked at the kinds of shapes that you see in those and we learnt the shapes

342
00:21:37,561 --> 00:21:44,328
and then created something new using those shapes. Now this is the same approach you can take if you

343
00:21:44,328 --> 00:21:50,975
say want to design a piece of furniture within a particular style or even if you want to do some

344
00:21:50,975 --> 00:21:54,558
artwork in the style of a particular artist.

345
00:21:56,642 --> 00:22:00,245
So another good use for shape language

346
00:22:00,245 --> 00:22:03,488
is when doing construction and structure.

347
00:22:03,488 --> 00:22:04,869
So that was the approach taken here,

348
00:22:04,869 --> 00:22:07,331
and we looked to marine architecture

349
00:22:07,331 --> 00:22:09,653
in order to create this design.

350
00:22:09,653 --> 00:22:12,395
And so again, this was done using shape language.

351
00:22:12,395 --> 00:22:15,297
So it treated it like with those moldings,

352
00:22:15,297 --> 00:22:16,899
learnt the language of the shapes,

353
00:22:16,899 --> 00:22:20,081
and created something in that language.

354
00:22:20,081 --> 00:22:21,282
Now, there is another way

355
00:22:21,282 --> 00:22:23,044
we could have approached this design.

356
00:22:23,044 --> 00:22:24,405
We could have instead done it

357
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:25,986
through a more role-playing approach.

358
00:22:26,296 --> 00:22:29,737
With that approach, you would design like an engineer would,

359
00:22:29,737 --> 00:22:32,338
and you would design it following principles

360
00:22:32,338 --> 00:22:35,158
about construction structure, the forces, and so on.

361
00:22:35,158 --> 00:22:39,099
Now, there are advantages and disadvantages

362
00:22:39,099 --> 00:22:40,600
to the two approaches.

363
00:22:40,600 --> 00:22:43,341
The advantage of the role-playing approach

364
00:22:43,341 --> 00:22:46,521
is that the final design is going to be much more realistic.

365
00:22:46,521 --> 00:22:49,422
The advantage of the shape language approach

366
00:22:49,662 --> 00:22:55,785
is that it's faster, it's more fluid, it's much easier to be creative and to make things up,

367
00:22:55,785 --> 00:23:01,928
and of course you don't need the same level of knowledge as you do for the role-playing approach.

368
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:12,893
Now a good design will usually use, will usually always use, aspects of both. So it will use

369
00:23:12,893 --> 00:23:17,755
some aspects of role-playing and some amount of shape language.

370
00:23:18,247 --> 00:23:24,853
and how much you lean towards one and how much you lean towards another will depend on the needs of

371
00:23:24,853 --> 00:23:30,838
the project or the needs of that particular design. So how important is realism versus how

372
00:23:30,838 --> 00:23:32,760
important is speed and creativity?

373
00:23:34,987 --> 00:23:39,572
So as mentioned, this is broader than just shape language.

374
00:23:39,572 --> 00:23:41,575
So by calling this aesthetic language,

375
00:23:41,575 --> 00:23:43,597
what I'm meaning is that everything

376
00:23:43,597 --> 00:23:45,459
that you can do there with shapes,

377
00:23:45,459 --> 00:23:48,363
you can do with other aspects of aesthetics as well.

378
00:23:49,144 --> 00:23:54,731
So you can look at your reference in terms of the level of density, how sparse is it or how

379
00:23:54,731 --> 00:24:01,260
dense and detailed is it, and you can learn that level of detail and create something

380
00:24:01,260 --> 00:24:04,765
again following the same aesthetic language here.

381
00:24:05,225 --> 00:24:10,609
So you can do that with cohesion as well. So how cohesive or not is it? Is it like the one on the

382
00:24:10,609 --> 00:24:16,412
left where we're getting a lot of repetition of shapes and colors and a limited palette,

383
00:24:16,412 --> 00:24:20,835
so it's more cohesive? Or does it have more variety like the one on the right?

384
00:24:20,835 --> 00:24:26,998
And also, what kind of colors are you seeing? What are the actual hues? What kind of variety

385
00:24:26,998 --> 00:24:32,622
are there? How limited is the palette? And are the colors coming from the objects or from the lighting?

386
00:24:33,613 --> 00:24:35,935
Also, what level of order are you seeing?

387
00:24:35,935 --> 00:24:38,737
Is it simple order like the image on the left,

388
00:24:38,737 --> 00:24:40,938
complex order like in the center,

389
00:24:40,938 --> 00:24:42,959
or is it chaotic like on the right?

390
00:24:42,959 --> 00:24:48,963
Now, it's also important to consider the different layers as well.

391
00:24:48,963 --> 00:24:51,865
Here, both of these images look very chaotic.

392
00:24:51,865 --> 00:24:54,987
However, the one on the left,

393
00:24:54,987 --> 00:24:57,629
the chaos is all coming from the set dressing,

394
00:24:57,629 --> 00:25:00,671
and the architecture is actually quite ordered.

395
00:25:00,671 --> 00:25:02,212
However, the one on the right,

396
00:25:02,544 --> 00:25:06,281
the architecture itself is chaotic as well.

397
00:25:07,215 --> 00:25:11,737
So when you're analyzing your spaces and the reference,

398
00:25:11,737 --> 00:25:13,918
need to be looking at all these different aspects

399
00:25:13,918 --> 00:25:15,639
in the different layers.

400
00:25:15,639 --> 00:25:17,519
So what's the architecture doing?

401
00:25:17,519 --> 00:25:18,980
What's the set dressing doing?

402
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,901
And what's the 2D graphics doing?

403
00:25:20,901 --> 00:25:24,303
And then when you analyze all of those layers

404
00:25:24,303 --> 00:25:25,483
for all the different aspects,

405
00:25:25,483 --> 00:25:27,904
so shapes, colors, textures, cohesion,

406
00:25:27,904 --> 00:25:29,445
order, chaos, and so on,

407
00:25:29,445 --> 00:25:32,746
then you can learn the language

408
00:25:32,746 --> 00:25:35,948
and start creating something by speaking in that language.

409
00:25:36,729 --> 00:25:42,173
And of course, like we mentioned earlier with the shape language, you want to mix this with some

410
00:25:42,173 --> 00:25:47,196
role-playing, because if you don't have any of the role-playing in there, then the space won't

411
00:25:47,196 --> 00:25:54,001
be quite as solid and real. But how much role-playing will of course depend on the needs of the project.

412
00:25:55,336 --> 00:25:59,019
So finally, under semiotics, I'm going to talk about tropes.

413
00:25:59,019 --> 00:26:02,783
So I'm not meaning here the use of this term

414
00:26:02,783 --> 00:26:04,404
that we are most familiar with,

415
00:26:04,404 --> 00:26:06,406
which is, of course, an overused cliche.

416
00:26:06,406 --> 00:26:09,128
Instead, I'm meaning the use of this term

417
00:26:09,128 --> 00:26:12,892
that you see in literary theory or semiotic theory.

418
00:26:12,892 --> 00:26:18,056
So there, tropes simply means figurative language.

419
00:26:18,457 --> 00:26:24,899
So it's figurative language in general rather than just a cliche. So there are a lot of different

420
00:26:24,899 --> 00:26:32,802
examples of tropes that you see in literary and semiotic theory. I'm just going to go over a few

421
00:26:32,802 --> 00:26:38,324
today. So metonymy is when you use something, is when you're referring to something that is related.

422
00:26:38,324 --> 00:26:44,066
So in other words, you could use the White House to refer to the US administration.

423
00:26:44,846 --> 00:26:51,235
Synecdoche on the other hand is when you're using a part to refer to a whole. So we could use the

424
00:26:51,235 --> 00:26:57,704
Eiffel Tower to refer to Paris or to France. And then metaphor on the other hand is when

425
00:26:57,704 --> 00:27:00,728
you are comparing two seemingly unrelated things.

426
00:27:01,199 --> 00:27:05,084
So for example, I could say, he has a sunny disposition.

427
00:27:05,084 --> 00:27:09,248
There I'm comparing two things which are seemingly unrelated,

428
00:27:09,248 --> 00:27:13,073
the fact, the sun, and then this person's disposition.

429
00:27:13,073 --> 00:27:16,317
And by comparing them, I am adding shades of meaning

430
00:27:16,317 --> 00:27:17,978
onto one of those things.

431
00:27:17,978 --> 00:27:19,560
So I'm changing how we see him.

432
00:27:21,145 --> 00:27:24,167
Now we can do that kind of metaphor visually as well.

433
00:27:24,167 --> 00:27:27,768
So this one here is using shape metaphors,

434
00:27:27,768 --> 00:27:29,669
but we could have also made metaphors

435
00:27:29,669 --> 00:27:32,811
with things like colors or textures or lighting

436
00:27:32,811 --> 00:27:34,271
or anything else as well.

437
00:27:34,271 --> 00:27:36,612
So the first, the one on the left

438
00:27:36,612 --> 00:27:38,893
is using circular shape metaphors

439
00:27:38,893 --> 00:27:42,515
and the one on the right are jagged angular shapes.

440
00:27:43,176 --> 00:27:51,004
So the circular shapes are going to remind us of things like rolling hills, bushes, fruit, babies,

441
00:27:51,004 --> 00:27:56,269
other humans. It's all nice things and friendly things and so that is the meaning that gets

442
00:27:56,269 --> 00:27:59,333
applied to the space. The one on the right however,

443
00:27:59,593 --> 00:28:05,277
The angular shapes remind us of things like broken bones,

444
00:28:05,277 --> 00:28:08,460
cleft edges, teeth, claws.

445
00:28:08,460 --> 00:28:13,024
It's all things which are far less pleasant,

446
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:15,466
and so it's those kind of associations

447
00:28:15,466 --> 00:28:17,407
that that's the meaning that gets applied to this space.

448
00:28:17,407 --> 00:28:19,569
And by the way, I'm going to go over the science of that

449
00:28:19,569 --> 00:28:23,272
in the next section, but to sum up semiotics first,

450
00:28:24,033 --> 00:28:28,395
So semiotics was all about signs and symbols and how we communicate.

451
00:28:28,395 --> 00:28:35,159
At its heart it's about signifiers and what is signified. We talked about the different

452
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:44,044
types of signifiers, so icons, indexes and symbols. And then we went on to aesthetic language.

453
00:28:44,044 --> 00:28:49,528
So we talked about shape language and we extended that into other aspects of aesthetics.

454
00:28:49,528 --> 00:28:52,970
And then we finally ended on tropes, which was how we can have

455
00:28:53,506 --> 00:28:56,136
figurative language and how that can be done visually.

456
00:28:57,063 --> 00:28:59,463
So next we're going to talk about cognition.

457
00:28:59,463 --> 00:29:02,984
So this section is all about neuroscience and psychology.

458
00:29:02,984 --> 00:29:06,465
So first up, we're going to talk about associations.

459
00:29:06,465 --> 00:29:10,005
And this is the science behind the tropes

460
00:29:10,005 --> 00:29:11,045
that we just covered.

461
00:29:11,045 --> 00:29:13,606
But before we get into that,

462
00:29:13,606 --> 00:29:16,827
I do just want to talk a little bit about the science

463
00:29:16,827 --> 00:29:19,207
that I mentioned in my previous talk.

464
00:29:19,207 --> 00:29:22,688
So in that talk, I talked about evolutionary theory

465
00:29:22,688 --> 00:29:23,388
and habitat theory.

466
00:29:23,988 --> 00:29:31,012
and how we evolved to like and dislike certain things because it helped our ancestors to survive.

467
00:29:31,012 --> 00:29:36,195
So I still think that science is accurate and it's definitely useful in some areas,

468
00:29:36,195 --> 00:29:43,139
especially things like what players will avoid and what players will move towards. However,

469
00:29:43,139 --> 00:29:47,982
when it comes to visual storytelling, the associations that I'm going to go over today

470
00:29:48,042 --> 00:29:52,732
feel far more useful and more applicable and much broader as well.

471
00:29:52,732 --> 00:29:57,021
So this is something of an update on the science from my previous talk.

472
00:29:58,902 --> 00:30:03,806
So this lecture here, which by the way is a fascinating lecture and I'd highly recommend

473
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:09,691
watching, it's a neuroscientist talking about aesthetics. So in that lecture he talks about

474
00:30:09,691 --> 00:30:16,976
synesthesia. So synesthesia is a mixing of the senses and the most common form of synesthesia

475
00:30:16,976 --> 00:30:24,742
is when people see numbers as having a colour. So if I was to show this diagram to someone with

476
00:30:24,742 --> 00:30:26,323
number colour synesthesia.

477
00:30:26,524 --> 00:30:30,466
And if I was to ask them what shape the twos are making,

478
00:30:30,466 --> 00:30:32,548
because this is a mixture of fives and twos,

479
00:30:32,548 --> 00:30:35,090
they would immediately be able to tell me

480
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:37,872
that the twos make up a triangular shape.

481
00:30:37,872 --> 00:30:39,994
And the reason they could tell me so quickly

482
00:30:39,994 --> 00:30:42,736
is because for them, the twos are tinted

483
00:30:42,736 --> 00:30:44,057
a different color to the fives,

484
00:30:44,057 --> 00:30:47,279
and so of course they can see that shape straight away.

485
00:30:48,512 --> 00:30:53,314
Now, what's going on in the brain of a synesthesiac

486
00:30:53,314 --> 00:30:55,835
is that early on in the brain's development,

487
00:30:55,835 --> 00:30:58,536
we have a lot of extra neural connections.

488
00:30:58,536 --> 00:31:01,718
As the brain develops, a lot of those get cut.

489
00:31:01,718 --> 00:31:04,379
In the brain of a synesthesiac,

490
00:31:04,379 --> 00:31:08,060
some of the connections that get cut in the rest of us

491
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:09,201
don't get cut for them.

492
00:31:09,741 --> 00:31:12,263
So with someone, and it's not that surprising,

493
00:31:12,263 --> 00:31:15,085
that number-color synesthesia is the most common

494
00:31:15,085 --> 00:31:17,847
because numbers and colors are right next

495
00:31:17,847 --> 00:31:18,827
to each other in the brain.

496
00:31:18,827 --> 00:31:22,309
So what's going on in the brain with somebody

497
00:31:22,309 --> 00:31:25,512
with number-color synesthesia is that when the number

498
00:31:25,512 --> 00:31:29,194
gets triggered in the brain, there is a hardwired connection

499
00:31:29,194 --> 00:31:30,755
to the colored part of the brain

500
00:31:30,755 --> 00:31:33,897
that's automatically triggering a color as well.

501
00:31:35,742 --> 00:31:40,945
So this kind of mixing of the senses is something that all of us do to some extent.

502
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:46,248
So if I was to show you all these shapes and tell you that one of these shapes is called Buba

503
00:31:46,248 --> 00:31:51,612
and one of these shapes is called Kiki, the vast majority of you are going to say that the first

504
00:31:51,612 --> 00:31:56,054
sharp shape is called Kiki and the second soft shape is called Buba.

505
00:31:56,515 --> 00:32:00,096
because a sharp shape obviously goes with a sharp word,

506
00:32:00,096 --> 00:32:03,538
and a soft shape obviously goes with a soft word.

507
00:32:03,538 --> 00:32:06,079
However, this is a mixing of the senses.

508
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:10,101
We are mixing here shapes with sounds.

509
00:32:10,101 --> 00:32:11,621
So interestingly enough,

510
00:32:11,621 --> 00:32:15,743
synesthesia is actually eight times more common

511
00:32:15,743 --> 00:32:17,404
in people with creative roles.

512
00:32:17,797 --> 00:32:20,179
compared to people with more technical roles.

513
00:32:20,179 --> 00:32:24,903
So the reason for this is, is that being able to create

514
00:32:24,903 --> 00:32:30,467
links between seemingly unrelated things is at the heart of creativity.

515
00:32:30,467 --> 00:32:34,691
It's also the very definition of metaphors which we described before,

516
00:32:34,691 --> 00:32:39,615
where the metaphor we are relating seemingly unrelated things

517
00:32:39,635 --> 00:32:45,476
And so that is exactly what's going on in the brain when we make these kind of visual metaphors.

518
00:32:45,476 --> 00:32:51,297
What we are doing is making connections in the brain between things which are seemingly unrelated

519
00:32:51,297 --> 00:32:58,479
in order for the meaning and associations of one to be applied to the other.

520
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:03,920
It is also important to be aware that there are cultural differences.

521
00:33:07,417 --> 00:33:13,159
So in this lecture here, this is a psychologist talking about aesthetics.

522
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:18,820
So he talks about a number of different studies that together create an interesting picture.

523
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:25,042
So in the first study, he looked at how much people liked or disliked different colors.

524
00:33:25,042 --> 00:33:29,483
So the bright blue that you're seeing at the top right, everybody likes that.

525
00:33:29,584 --> 00:33:31,605
and the dirty yellow in the bottom left,

526
00:33:31,605 --> 00:33:32,966
everyone dislikes that.

527
00:33:32,966 --> 00:33:36,229
Next, he looked at what people associate

528
00:33:36,229 --> 00:33:37,270
with those different colors,

529
00:33:37,270 --> 00:33:40,613
so that bright blue was associated with the sky,

530
00:33:40,613 --> 00:33:44,396
and that dirty yellow was associated with vomit.

531
00:33:44,396 --> 00:33:47,639
And next, he looked at how much people liked or disliked

532
00:33:47,639 --> 00:33:49,741
the things that were associated with those colors.

533
00:33:50,182 --> 00:33:52,043
So how much do people like the sky

534
00:33:52,043 --> 00:33:54,466
and how much do people like vomit?

535
00:33:54,466 --> 00:33:57,548
And next he compared how much people liked the colors

536
00:33:57,548 --> 00:34:00,451
or disliked them and how much they liked or disliked

537
00:34:00,451 --> 00:34:02,473
the things associated with those colors.

538
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:07,738
So to give a layman's interpretation of his results,

539
00:34:07,738 --> 00:34:10,880
80% of how much we like or dislike a certain color

540
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:13,403
is coming from how much we like or dislike.

541
00:34:13,463 --> 00:34:18,950
the things associated with that color. So again, Leibman's interpretation here,

542
00:34:18,950 --> 00:34:24,338
80% of the visual storytelling of a color is coming from what we associate with that color.

543
00:34:25,943 --> 00:34:30,207
So next he did a study of different cultures.

544
00:34:30,207 --> 00:34:33,429
So he looked at Japan, US, Mexico, and Serbia,

545
00:34:33,429 --> 00:34:35,331
and looked at the color preferences

546
00:34:35,331 --> 00:34:37,273
in those different countries.

547
00:34:37,273 --> 00:34:40,956
So every single country liked a nice sky blue,

548
00:34:40,956 --> 00:34:44,739
and every single country disliked a vomit yellow.

549
00:34:45,262 --> 00:34:50,325
However, when it came to the other colors, there was a lot more variety.

550
00:34:50,325 --> 00:34:55,328
So what this tells us as visual designers is that when we're making associations,

551
00:34:55,328 --> 00:35:01,312
so when we're making references, if we're referencing something that is a universal

552
00:35:01,312 --> 00:35:07,336
human experience in the same way that the sky is a universal human experience and vomit is a

553
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:13,140
universal human experience, if that's what we're referencing, then we can be confident that

554
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:14,862
everyone will understand us.

555
00:35:15,305 --> 00:35:20,108
However, if we're referencing things which are a bit more culturally specific,

556
00:35:20,108 --> 00:35:25,272
then not everyone's going to understand it. So in terms of what to do about that, sometimes we

557
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:32,216
don't need to do anything at all. Some aspects of visual storytelling are sometimes in there

558
00:35:32,216 --> 00:35:38,080
just to create an extra richness to a design, but sometimes it is important that people understand,

559
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:43,303
and when this is the case, what we need to do is we need to communicate via multiple channels.

560
00:35:43,787 --> 00:35:50,690
So we need to communicate via, you know, like not just colors, but maybe shapes as well,

561
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:55,891
or textures, or maybe you look to other sections of this talk and maybe you add an index

562
00:35:55,891 --> 00:36:01,413
signifier or a icon signifier because those aren't culturally specific.

563
00:36:03,673 --> 00:36:06,715
So next we're going on to spatial metaphors.

564
00:36:06,715 --> 00:36:08,535
So what's going on in the brain here

565
00:36:08,535 --> 00:36:13,197
is that the brain creates social cognitive maps.

566
00:36:13,197 --> 00:36:16,738
So the brain takes the neural infrastructure

567
00:36:16,738 --> 00:36:19,399
that was developed in order to understand

568
00:36:19,399 --> 00:36:22,200
and navigate the physical environment,

569
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,881
and the brain has co-opted that

570
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:27,522
in order to understand and navigate the social environment.

571
00:36:27,802 --> 00:36:30,723
So I could say something like,

572
00:36:30,723 --> 00:36:32,744
somebody is close to me,

573
00:36:32,744 --> 00:36:35,144
somebody else has been distant recently,

574
00:36:35,144 --> 00:36:37,805
somebody else is above me at work,

575
00:36:37,805 --> 00:36:40,406
somebody else is ahead of me at school.

576
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:42,967
All of those are spatial metaphors

577
00:36:42,967 --> 00:36:45,007
used to describe social relationships.

578
00:36:45,007 --> 00:36:47,248
And so this article here

579
00:36:47,248 --> 00:36:51,209
goes into the science more, if anyone's interested.

580
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:54,390
And again, all of these references will be on my website.

581
00:36:55,418 --> 00:37:01,723
So what's interesting is that kind of social spatial metaphor is obviously

582
00:37:01,723 --> 00:37:07,126
what's going on in terms of why film high shots and low shots work. So when

583
00:37:07,126 --> 00:37:11,229
the camera is above the character it mimics being spatially above and

584
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:15,812
therefore socially above the character and the reverse when the camera is below.

585
00:37:15,812 --> 00:37:20,535
So when the person is socially below you obviously it makes them look

586
00:37:20,535 --> 00:37:24,757
weak and socially above you obviously it makes them look strong.

587
00:37:25,438 --> 00:37:32,964
So we can't normally control cameras to this extent in a video game, but what we can do

588
00:37:32,964 --> 00:37:38,228
is we can set up the spaces in order to create the same storytelling.

589
00:37:39,232 --> 00:37:44,115
So here we can simply create the space

590
00:37:44,115 --> 00:37:46,997
so that the character is simply above

591
00:37:46,997 --> 00:37:49,518
or below other characters.

592
00:37:49,518 --> 00:37:51,319
And for us in video games,

593
00:37:51,319 --> 00:37:53,180
this is an area rich with potential as well.

594
00:37:53,180 --> 00:37:56,682
3D games are so fundamentally spatial

595
00:37:56,682 --> 00:37:58,643
that we really have a lot to play with here.

596
00:37:59,803 --> 00:38:06,487
So next under cognition, so we're talking all about neuroscience and psychology in this section.

597
00:38:06,487 --> 00:38:12,791
Next we have the concept of peak shift. So before I go into peak shift though, I want to talk first

598
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:19,535
about caricature. So caricature is when we take the features of somebody and we exaggerate the

599
00:38:19,535 --> 00:38:25,418
features that are different to normal. So Lincoln's ears are bigger than average ears,

600
00:38:25,418 --> 00:38:28,160
and so the caricaturist has made them even bigger.

601
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:36,043
and often this kind of caricature can be easier to read, especially quickly and at a glance,

602
00:38:36,043 --> 00:38:41,505
compared to far more realistic representations. So the science of peak shift explains why that's

603
00:38:41,505 --> 00:38:48,507
the case, but first we don't just get this kind of visual hyperbole just in caricature.

604
00:38:49,428 --> 00:38:54,792
So an example in art would be something like this Indian statue from the 19th century.

605
00:38:54,792 --> 00:39:01,758
Here what the artist has done is they've taken the difference between a male and female figure

606
00:39:01,758 --> 00:39:07,283
and they've exaggerated those differences. So in the same way you could immediately tell that that

607
00:39:07,283 --> 00:39:12,948
was a picture of Lincoln, here you can immediately tell that you're looking at a statue of a woman

608
00:39:12,948 --> 00:39:13,788
rather than a man.

609
00:39:15,782 --> 00:39:20,125
So in in-game example, so this is GTA V DLC.

610
00:39:20,125 --> 00:39:25,830
Here, we've taken the difference between somebody

611
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:28,232
with a lot of money and somebody who doesn't,

612
00:39:28,232 --> 00:39:30,894
and we've exaggerated that difference.

613
00:39:30,894 --> 00:39:34,217
And so by having all of this money lying around,

614
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:38,280
we can immediately see how rich and well-off the player is.

615
00:39:39,292 --> 00:39:45,576
So even in the base GTA 5 game that hasn't gotten as extreme as some of the DLC,

616
00:39:45,576 --> 00:39:50,900
even there what we're doing is we're focusing on the interesting bits, we're cutting out the

617
00:39:50,900 --> 00:39:55,983
boring bits, and we're really concentrating on the areas that give us good storytelling.

618
00:39:55,983 --> 00:40:00,046
And by doing that we're creating something that is hyper real rather than real.

619
00:40:01,381 --> 00:40:05,523
So the science behind why this kind of visual hyperbole

620
00:40:05,523 --> 00:40:07,104
can be easier to understand

621
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:09,545
than something that's more realistic,

622
00:40:09,545 --> 00:40:12,566
the science behind that is the concept called peak shift.

623
00:40:12,566 --> 00:40:17,949
So that is from the same video that I mentioned before.

624
00:40:17,949 --> 00:40:21,491
He goes over a couple of different studies in this video.

625
00:40:21,491 --> 00:40:24,132
There's not time to go over both of them now,

626
00:40:24,132 --> 00:40:26,213
so I'm just gonna talk about one of them.

627
00:40:26,213 --> 00:40:30,795
So a rat was given a square and a rectangle.

628
00:40:31,176 --> 00:40:33,538
and the rectangle had more cheese,

629
00:40:33,538 --> 00:40:36,401
so of course the rat started preferring

630
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,622
going to the rectangle.

631
00:40:37,622 --> 00:40:40,906
What was interesting is when the rat was introduced

632
00:40:40,906 --> 00:40:43,108
to a far more extreme rectangle,

633
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:45,210
the rat immediately preferred

634
00:40:45,210 --> 00:40:47,132
going to the more extreme rectangle.

635
00:40:48,053 --> 00:40:53,415
And that is because the rat didn't learn that a particular size and shape of rectangle equals

636
00:40:53,415 --> 00:40:58,797
cheese. What the rat learned instead was that rectangle-ness equals cheese.

637
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:03,018
And so when it saw a more extreme rectangle, the rat assumed more cheese.

638
00:41:03,802 --> 00:41:09,266
And so that is what's going on with this kind of thing here.

639
00:41:09,266 --> 00:41:12,889
We don't remember that the size and we

640
00:41:12,889 --> 00:41:16,112
don't remember the exact size and shape of Lincoln's ears.

641
00:41:16,112 --> 00:41:20,035
Instead, we remember that they are larger than normal.

642
00:41:20,035 --> 00:41:23,037
And so when that gets exaggerated,

643
00:41:23,037 --> 00:41:24,799
it makes it easier to read.

644
00:41:24,799 --> 00:41:28,082
And so that's why visual hyperbole

645
00:41:28,082 --> 00:41:30,884
can be much easier to read and understand rather

646
00:41:30,884 --> 00:41:32,505
than being purely realistic.

647
00:41:33,950 --> 00:41:40,175
So next under cognition, so this section is all about neuroscience and psychology. Next we have

648
00:41:40,175 --> 00:41:47,401
gestalt, but before I get into gestalt I want to talk first about affinity and contrast.

649
00:41:47,401 --> 00:41:51,964
So these are concepts from film and there's more about them in this book here.

650
00:41:52,585 --> 00:41:55,625
and what affinity and contrast are.

651
00:41:55,625 --> 00:41:58,786
So affinity is when things are similar

652
00:41:58,786 --> 00:42:01,067
and a contrast is when they're different.

653
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:03,267
Affinity can be used to communicate

654
00:42:03,267 --> 00:42:05,788
social cohesion and bonding

655
00:42:05,788 --> 00:42:08,508
and contrast can be used to communicate conflict.

656
00:42:08,508 --> 00:42:11,189
So here in this still from Edward Scissorhands,

657
00:42:11,189 --> 00:42:16,870
we have a lot of similarity and therefore affinity

658
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:18,271
with all of these suburban houses

659
00:42:18,271 --> 00:42:22,232
and so that communicates social cohesion there.

660
00:42:22,672 --> 00:42:26,494
whereas we have a lot of contrast with the house on the hill and so that

661
00:42:26,494 --> 00:42:31,178
communicates conflict with the house on the hill. So reading about Gestalt

662
00:42:31,178 --> 00:42:36,661
psychology this is very obviously the science behind why affinity and contrast

663
00:42:36,661 --> 00:42:37,282
is working.

664
00:42:38,127 --> 00:42:44,731
So Gestalt psychology is all about how we understand things as a whole rather than as parts.

665
00:42:44,731 --> 00:42:51,055
So how is it that we understand that that tiger is a single tiger behind the bushes

666
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:56,498
rather than seeing that as a whole load of kind of smaller orange-colored objects?

667
00:42:57,794 --> 00:43:02,979
So that is all through the laws of Gestalt.

668
00:43:02,979 --> 00:43:04,681
There are quite a lot of those laws.

669
00:43:04,681 --> 00:43:06,884
I'm just going to mention three here.

670
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,766
So we have the law of similarity,

671
00:43:08,766 --> 00:43:11,448
the law of continuity, and the law of closure.

672
00:43:12,254 --> 00:43:17,717
So the law of similarity helps us to see all those different patches between the bushes

673
00:43:17,717 --> 00:43:22,779
as belonging to the same thing because all of those patches are a similar color, texture,

674
00:43:22,779 --> 00:43:29,522
and pattern, and so on. The laws of continuity and closure help us see the edge of the tiger's back

675
00:43:29,522 --> 00:43:30,943
as a continuous curve.

676
00:43:32,335 --> 00:43:36,397
And so with those and the other laws of Gestalt,

677
00:43:36,397 --> 00:43:39,197
we can see that that is one whole object,

678
00:43:39,197 --> 00:43:41,718
a single tiger behind the bushes.

679
00:43:41,718 --> 00:43:44,439
And so that is obviously what's going on here

680
00:43:44,439 --> 00:43:46,420
with affinity and contrast,

681
00:43:46,420 --> 00:43:47,420
what the brain is doing

682
00:43:47,420 --> 00:43:50,341
with all the different suburban houses

683
00:43:50,341 --> 00:43:51,461
because they're so similar,

684
00:43:51,461 --> 00:43:55,422
is treating them like the different patches of the tiger,

685
00:43:55,422 --> 00:43:56,863
and it's tying them together

686
00:43:56,863 --> 00:43:58,603
and saying they belong to each other.

687
00:43:59,685 --> 00:44:02,386
And whereas the house on the hill,

688
00:44:02,386 --> 00:44:03,806
because that's so different,

689
00:44:03,806 --> 00:44:06,107
it's treating that like the bushes

690
00:44:06,107 --> 00:44:08,267
that were in front of the tiger,

691
00:44:08,267 --> 00:44:09,747
and it's separating them out

692
00:44:09,747 --> 00:44:12,008
and treating them as something separate.

693
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:14,829
So to sum up the cognition section,

694
00:44:14,829 --> 00:44:18,390
so associations was all about synesthesia

695
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:20,290
and the connections we make in the brain.

696
00:44:20,807 --> 00:44:25,492
and that was the science behind why tropes and metaphors work.

697
00:44:25,492 --> 00:44:33,140
Spatial metaphors, that was about how the brain has co-opted the infrastructure that was

698
00:44:33,140 --> 00:44:38,846
developed in order to understand and navigate the physical environment,

699
00:44:38,846 --> 00:44:42,530
and it now uses it to understand and navigate the social environment.

700
00:44:43,091 --> 00:44:47,156
Peak shift was the science behind caricature and visual hyperbole,

701
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:52,083
and gestalt was the science behind affinity and contrast.

702
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:58,051
So next we're going to talk about some aspects of the overall structure of our visual storytelling,

703
00:44:58,051 --> 00:44:59,513
starting with layouts.

704
00:45:00,905 --> 00:45:06,349
So there are two aspects that are important here, the layout of the form and the layout of the path.

705
00:45:06,349 --> 00:45:11,453
So the layout of the form is going to affect the player's mental model of a space,

706
00:45:11,453 --> 00:45:16,296
and the layout of the path is going to affect their experience over time.

707
00:45:16,677 --> 00:45:20,537
So some examples of layout of the form.

708
00:45:20,537 --> 00:45:23,138
So these all come from this book here,

709
00:45:23,138 --> 00:45:26,079
which is a fantastic book by the way.

710
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:29,620
So we have a centralized layout, a linear layout,

711
00:45:29,620 --> 00:45:32,440
radial, clustered, and grid-like.

712
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:36,061
So a centralized layout is something like this.

713
00:45:36,061 --> 00:45:38,162
Linear, like this.

714
00:45:38,162 --> 00:45:41,902
Radial, similar to linear, except there are multiple arms.

715
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:43,503
Clustered looks like this.

716
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:47,405
and grid-like is similar to clustered except more ordered.

717
00:45:47,405 --> 00:45:51,968
Now the layout of the path is not completely dictated by the layout of the

718
00:45:51,968 --> 00:45:55,391
form. For example, if we look at something

719
00:45:55,391 --> 00:45:59,974
like this, a centralized layout, we can imagine a number of different

720
00:45:59,974 --> 00:46:04,337
path layouts in it. So we could imagine taking a radial path,

721
00:46:04,337 --> 00:46:09,440
a more grid-like path, or a linear path through that space.

722
00:46:10,325 --> 00:46:15,551
So obviously a linear path through these three different forms, so a linear path that goes

723
00:46:15,551 --> 00:46:22,038
around a centralized form, versus a linear path that goes along a linear form, versus a linear

724
00:46:22,038 --> 00:46:27,064
path that meanders through a clustered form, those linear paths are going to feel very,

725
00:46:27,064 --> 00:46:32,310
very different because of the different forms. And this is because the layout of the form

726
00:46:32,630 --> 00:46:37,474
is dictating our mental model of the space, whereas the layout of the path is dictating

727
00:46:37,474 --> 00:46:43,520
our experience over time. So it's the two of these together which creates the overall structure of

728
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,385
the experience for the player. So there are a few different types of layouts of path,

729
00:46:49,385 --> 00:46:55,430
so just a few examples here. Linear, circular, radial, clustered and grid-like.

730
00:46:57,235 --> 00:47:05,340
So it can be hard to make something that is rich and complex working just from first principles.

731
00:47:05,340 --> 00:47:11,524
So my advice here would be to look at reference and look at perspectival reference as well as

732
00:47:11,524 --> 00:47:17,128
plans and sections. So because you get different information from each of those different types

733
00:47:17,128 --> 00:47:22,871
of reference. Also you're not looking here at the dressing and the details and the textures

734
00:47:22,871 --> 00:47:23,732
and so on.

735
00:47:23,952 --> 00:47:28,715
Instead, you're mentally stripping that away and you're just looking at the spatial design.

736
00:47:28,715 --> 00:47:33,738
And so what you can do is you can look for inspiration here for the kind of experience

737
00:47:33,738 --> 00:47:40,201
you want the player to have and combine that with your direction in terms of the layout of the

738
00:47:40,201 --> 00:47:44,263
space and the layout of the, sorry, the layout of the form and the layout of the player path.

739
00:47:45,683 --> 00:47:48,405
So next under structure, we have intensity.

740
00:47:48,405 --> 00:47:52,529
So it's very important to vary the intensity over the time

741
00:47:52,529 --> 00:47:55,812
because a consistently high level of intensity

742
00:47:55,812 --> 00:47:57,894
will get overwhelming for the player

743
00:47:57,894 --> 00:48:00,497
and a consistently low level will be boring.

744
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:03,099
So you need to vary your intensity

745
00:48:03,099 --> 00:48:06,082
in order to make a rich experience for the player.

746
00:48:07,120 --> 00:48:11,904
Now, the final intensity that the player experiences will be a mixture.

747
00:48:11,904 --> 00:48:17,528
It will come from a mix of the environment, art, with the gameplay and the narrative.

748
00:48:18,560 --> 00:48:21,922
So you could imagine a situation like here,

749
00:48:21,922 --> 00:48:24,264
where we have a very serene environment,

750
00:48:24,264 --> 00:48:27,286
and it's mixed with incredibly intense gameplay,

751
00:48:27,286 --> 00:48:29,908
and so the player's experience is going to be very intense.

752
00:48:29,908 --> 00:48:33,491
And of course, we could also imagine the reverse,

753
00:48:33,491 --> 00:48:36,813
where you get a very intense environment,

754
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,475
but the gameplay is very calm.

755
00:48:38,475 --> 00:48:42,398
That is still going to result in a more intense experience

756
00:48:42,398 --> 00:48:44,980
than having calm gameplay in a calm environment.

757
00:48:46,129 --> 00:48:49,992
So in terms of where and how we can increase visual intensity,

758
00:48:49,992 --> 00:48:58,297
so we can do that through affinity and contrast. So the more contrast you have in an environment,

759
00:48:58,297 --> 00:49:00,799
the higher the level of intensity will be.

760
00:49:01,671 --> 00:49:03,832
And that's all from this book here.

761
00:49:03,832 --> 00:49:07,053
But we can also increase intensity

762
00:49:07,053 --> 00:49:09,954
just purely in the aesthetics alone.

763
00:49:09,954 --> 00:49:13,815
So we can do things like have more intense colors.

764
00:49:13,815 --> 00:49:15,836
We can have more intense shapes.

765
00:49:15,836 --> 00:49:17,796
So angular shapes and jagged shapes

766
00:49:17,796 --> 00:49:21,077
and things which are unbalanced and top-heavy,

767
00:49:21,077 --> 00:49:23,398
they are going to be more intense

768
00:49:23,398 --> 00:49:25,939
than square shapes and vertical shapes

769
00:49:25,939 --> 00:49:27,720
and things which are very stable.

770
00:49:28,600 --> 00:49:30,681
And of course, increasing density

771
00:49:30,681 --> 00:49:33,163
will increase your intensity as well.

772
00:49:33,163 --> 00:49:35,885
So finally, under structure,

773
00:49:35,885 --> 00:49:38,167
I'm going to talk about contrast.

774
00:49:38,167 --> 00:49:41,830
So as humans, we understand things through contrast.

775
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:45,072
Somebody is short compared to somebody who is taller.

776
00:49:45,072 --> 00:49:48,454
Somebody is young compared to somebody who is older.

777
00:49:48,454 --> 00:49:50,356
So if we want to communicate

778
00:49:50,356 --> 00:49:53,098
that a particular building is very modern,

779
00:49:53,098 --> 00:49:56,600
if we have that building in a sea of other modern buildings,

780
00:49:56,620 --> 00:50:00,406
that meaning is going to get lost, nobody will notice.

781
00:50:00,406 --> 00:50:03,390
However, if we have our modern building

782
00:50:03,390 --> 00:50:05,493
in a context of buildings which are much older,

783
00:50:05,493 --> 00:50:07,776
then the player will notice.

784
00:50:07,776 --> 00:50:10,320
Now, it sounds very obvious when I say it.

785
00:50:10,838 --> 00:50:12,919
But in practice and in the moment,

786
00:50:12,919 --> 00:50:15,841
this can actually be counterintuitive.

787
00:50:15,841 --> 00:50:17,461
Often the obvious thing to do

788
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:20,903
always feels like to be consistent.

789
00:50:20,903 --> 00:50:22,884
However, if we're too consistent,

790
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:25,825
then we lose any contrast

791
00:50:25,825 --> 00:50:28,526
and we lose some of our storytelling for the player.

792
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:33,929
This isn't just about contrast over a single visual field.

793
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:36,290
This is about contrast over time.

794
00:50:37,788 --> 00:50:40,591
So there is a concept in environmental psychology

795
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:44,234
called adaptation, and that's about how we become adapted

796
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:45,976
to things over time.

797
00:50:45,976 --> 00:50:49,459
So somebody who lives in a busy city will become adapted

798
00:50:49,459 --> 00:50:52,462
to the faster pace of life in that busy city,

799
00:50:52,462 --> 00:50:55,505
and somebody who lives in the countryside will get adapted

800
00:50:55,505 --> 00:50:58,088
to the slower pace of life in the countryside.

801
00:50:58,882 --> 00:51:04,563
So what that means for us, let's say we were going to do a design like this and we wanted

802
00:51:04,563 --> 00:51:11,045
the players to notice how ornamental and intricate and detailed it is. However, if every other space

803
00:51:11,045 --> 00:51:16,826
we've given the player looks like this, the player is going to become adapted to this level of

804
00:51:16,826 --> 00:51:21,887
ornament and detail. And when the player eventually sees this space, they're simply not going to

805
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:24,088
notice how ornamental it is.

806
00:51:24,687 --> 00:51:29,649
However, if every other space we've given the player beforehand looks like this,

807
00:51:29,649 --> 00:51:34,372
then the player will become adapted to this level of ornament and detail, or lack of it,

808
00:51:34,372 --> 00:51:40,275
and then when the player eventually gets here, it's going to seem incredibly intricate and

809
00:51:40,275 --> 00:51:44,618
ornamental to the player. So to sum up the structure section,

810
00:51:44,618 --> 00:51:50,301
layout was about the layout of the form and the layout of the path.

811
00:51:50,712 --> 00:51:54,977
and the overall player experience comes from a mixture of both.

812
00:51:54,977 --> 00:51:59,181
And with intensity, it's important to vary the intensity over time.

813
00:51:59,181 --> 00:52:04,107
And with contrast, it's important to have contrast in order to communicate to the

814
00:52:04,107 --> 00:52:07,651
player. And to sum up the whole talk now, so the

815
00:52:07,651 --> 00:52:11,976
first section, mimesis, that was all about mimicking and copying

816
00:52:11,976 --> 00:52:12,696
reality.

817
00:52:13,225 --> 00:52:17,252
Semiotics was all about signs and symbols and how we communicate.

818
00:52:17,252 --> 00:52:21,538
The cognition section was all about neuroscience and psychology

819
00:52:21,538 --> 00:52:24,663
and then we ended on some aspects of structure.

820
00:52:24,663 --> 00:52:26,766
And to remind you again...

821
00:52:27,229 --> 00:52:33,452
If you would like to follow up in terms of some more books and references on this topic,

822
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:39,036
I will be putting a bibliography up on my website and I'll be putting that up for when

823
00:52:39,036 --> 00:52:46,101
this goes live. So anyone looking at this early, it might not quite be up yet. So thank you very

824
00:52:46,101 --> 00:52:49,663
much for listening to my talk and I hope you got a lot out of it.
