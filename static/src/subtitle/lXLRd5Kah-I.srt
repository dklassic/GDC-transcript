1
00:00:12,329 --> 00:00:12,669
All right.

2
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:14,891
Hello and a warm welcome, everyone.

3
00:00:15,211 --> 00:00:16,372
My name is Myles Tost,

4
00:00:16,532 --> 00:00:19,114
and I have the honor to represent the bright minds

5
00:00:19,154 --> 00:00:22,377
of the CDPR level design team here at GDC today.

6
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:25,600
I've been working as a level designer at CDPR

7
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:26,941
for more than 10 years now,

8
00:00:27,681 --> 00:00:30,383
and currently have the privilege to lead the level design team

9
00:00:30,463 --> 00:00:31,945
on our upcoming Witcher game.

10
00:00:33,464 --> 00:00:36,947
Small disclaimer, the timing of this talk

11
00:00:36,967 --> 00:00:39,570
will actually be pretty tight, which is why, unfortunately,

12
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:42,552
I believe there won't be any time for Q&A here in this room.

13
00:00:43,713 --> 00:00:46,556
However, after the talk, I will wander straight outside.

14
00:00:46,576 --> 00:00:47,657
There's this little alcove.

15
00:00:48,297 --> 00:00:50,519
And there, I will gladly answer all of your questions

16
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:51,200
until I drop.

17
00:00:52,041 --> 00:00:54,983
So once again, I'm so happy to see you all here

18
00:00:55,144 --> 00:00:57,065
and would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart

19
00:00:57,626 --> 00:00:58,326
for joining me.

20
00:01:01,190 --> 00:01:05,051
Today, I would like to tell you a five-part story about how

21
00:01:05,071 --> 00:01:07,332
the CDPR level design team and I learned

22
00:01:07,872 --> 00:01:09,333
of the benefits of missing out.

23
00:01:10,173 --> 00:01:12,514
My hope with this talk is that I can provide you

24
00:01:12,534 --> 00:01:16,355
guys with some insights into the level design of Cyberpunk 2077.

25
00:01:17,415 --> 00:01:19,856
And in the end, a better understanding

26
00:01:19,896 --> 00:01:22,697
and a concrete set of principles of how

27
00:01:22,737 --> 00:01:25,718
to create nonlinear levels that give each player,

28
00:01:26,259 --> 00:01:29,300
no matter which path they pick, a more special experience.

29
00:01:32,597 --> 00:01:35,739
And our journey starts right at the beginning.

30
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:38,981
It's shortly before the release of our second Witcher 3

31
00:01:39,041 --> 00:01:41,583
expansion, Blood and Wine, in early 2016,

32
00:01:41,663 --> 00:01:45,565
when I, together with the other level designers,

33
00:01:45,645 --> 00:01:47,326
start moving to Cyberpunk 2077.

34
00:01:49,324 --> 00:01:51,686
After four years of working on a medieval fantasy world

35
00:01:51,726 --> 00:01:54,789
with wide open landscapes, relatively limited amount

36
00:01:54,829 --> 00:01:58,332
of ways to play a defined character, no offense, Geralt,

37
00:01:59,113 --> 00:02:01,395
and a third person perspective, I

38
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:04,117
couldn't wait to switch working on a game that I learned

39
00:02:04,137 --> 00:02:06,359
couldn't be more different in regards to the challenges it

40
00:02:06,480 --> 00:02:07,160
would present.

41
00:02:07,981 --> 00:02:08,642
I was hyped.

42
00:02:11,824 --> 00:02:13,786
So what were we about to deal with?

43
00:02:15,145 --> 00:02:19,028
Cyberpunk 2077 takes place entirely in first-person perspective

44
00:02:19,148 --> 00:02:21,910
in a claustrophobic megalopolis called Night City.

45
00:02:23,511 --> 00:02:27,074
Unlike predefined Witcher Geralt, V, our protagonist,

46
00:02:27,314 --> 00:02:30,696
was meant to allow players the ultimate freedom to play who they want to be.

47
00:02:31,437 --> 00:02:33,738
That is, if we could pull it off.

48
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,019
No pressure.

49
00:02:37,721 --> 00:02:42,545
From a high level, all of our recent triple-A RPGs are based on a few pillars.

50
00:02:43,874 --> 00:02:47,537
That is, the freedom in the story, freedom in the world,

51
00:02:48,598 --> 00:02:49,579
freedom in the gameplay.

52
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,281
When we look at these design pillars,

53
00:02:52,501 --> 00:02:53,682
it's actually the first two which

54
00:02:53,722 --> 00:02:56,585
have been massive in driving the development of Witcher 3.

55
00:02:57,546 --> 00:03:00,088
It's the third one, then, freedom in gameplay,

56
00:03:00,508 --> 00:03:02,450
that was the big new addition to Cyberpunk.

57
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:05,032
And this is where the gameplay and level design teams

58
00:03:05,092 --> 00:03:06,994
wanted to make a gigantic leap forward.

59
00:03:07,654 --> 00:03:08,955
The inspiration for our ambitions

60
00:03:09,015 --> 00:03:12,058
came from immersive sim titans, such as the original Deus

61
00:03:12,218 --> 00:03:12,238
X.

62
00:03:13,237 --> 00:03:17,477
Mind you, it being CDPR, we weren't the only discipline

63
00:03:17,497 --> 00:03:18,798
with huge ambitions and dreams.

64
00:03:22,298 --> 00:03:24,298
So based off these pillars, we were

65
00:03:24,378 --> 00:03:27,119
presented by our directors with a few design goals.

66
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:30,840
Style over substance is a model that

67
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,500
is at the heart of Mike Pondsmith's original pen

68
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:37,181
and paper universe, which Cyberpunk actually is based on.

69
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:39,761
Why do something in a mundane way

70
00:03:39,821 --> 00:03:42,241
when you could do and go about it in style?

71
00:03:43,152 --> 00:03:47,495
Our goal was to give players the options to generously apply

72
00:03:47,535 --> 00:03:49,317
the rule of cool to their characters

73
00:03:49,357 --> 00:03:50,098
and how they play them.

74
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:56,063
Likewise, we didn't want them to go do that and then end up

75
00:03:56,103 --> 00:03:59,085
in a dead end or with an unviable play style.

76
00:03:59,586 --> 00:04:02,588
So every option they chose, no matter the combo,

77
00:04:02,949 --> 00:04:05,131
should result in a valid way to play the game.

78
00:04:06,192 --> 00:04:08,974
This is what freedom in gameplay was all about, after all.

79
00:04:10,122 --> 00:04:12,104
And in order to enable this level of freedom,

80
00:04:12,465 --> 00:04:15,808
we were asked to make levels that supported a ton,

81
00:04:16,369 --> 00:04:18,731
a ton of vastly different play styles.

82
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:25,299
That is melee versus ranged, mobility versus stability,

83
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:30,324
brute force versus ingenuity, and combat versus stealth.

84
00:04:31,432 --> 00:04:38,217
And we thought to ourselves, levels supported by immersive sim-style systems and build-as-sandboxes,

85
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:39,998
what a dream.

86
00:04:41,099 --> 00:04:45,442
And they all had to be part of a huge open world and take into account the complex branching

87
00:04:45,482 --> 00:04:50,125
narrative and cinematic focus of our quests with all their possibilities and outcomes.

88
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:52,086
Oh.

89
00:04:54,047 --> 00:05:00,648
Now, neither the studio nor most of the four to five level designers working on the game at the time

90
00:05:01,228 --> 00:05:04,249
had ever done stuff like this before. That includes myself.

91
00:05:04,949 --> 00:05:08,630
But as insane as it sounded, it also sounded fucking awesome.

92
00:05:09,410 --> 00:05:10,930
And boy, were we up to the challenge.

93
00:05:14,071 --> 00:05:17,252
So, how does one even begin to eat this whale?

94
00:05:17,872 --> 00:05:21,133
This is a question for which it took us a long time to find an answer to.

95
00:05:22,502 --> 00:05:25,663
Our gameplay designers decided to base all of the abilities

96
00:05:25,703 --> 00:05:28,204
and perks on the fantasies of the classes

97
00:05:28,264 --> 00:05:29,584
of the original pen and paper.

98
00:05:30,564 --> 00:05:33,605
We didn't want to have fixed classes in Cyberpunk 2077,

99
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:34,706
freedom and all that,

100
00:05:35,546 --> 00:05:37,687
but instead allow players to build their own

101
00:05:37,747 --> 00:05:40,227
by mixing and matching a ton of different perks,

102
00:05:40,707 --> 00:05:43,288
abilities, weapons, and cyberware

103
00:05:43,548 --> 00:05:45,889
to effectively recreate the fantasy

104
00:05:45,929 --> 00:05:48,830
of the source game's classes or anything in between.

105
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:53,274
Knowing this, we decided to structure our levels

106
00:05:53,374 --> 00:05:55,715
around the most purest character fantasies

107
00:05:55,835 --> 00:05:58,076
Cyberpunk players would be able to create.

108
00:05:58,956 --> 00:06:02,257
Our archetypes, representing the original classes,

109
00:06:02,577 --> 00:06:04,358
Solo, Netrunner, and Techie.

110
00:06:06,018 --> 00:06:10,240
The theory was that if a player completely invested themselves

111
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,140
into fulfilling a specific archetype,

112
00:06:14,261 --> 00:06:16,422
they would get their own unique path through a level,

113
00:06:16,762 --> 00:06:17,882
and it would feel rewarding.

114
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:22,800
If players were mixing archetypes,

115
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,642
they would be able to follow one of the three paths

116
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:27,184
for as long as they liked.

117
00:06:27,785 --> 00:06:29,947
And if their abilities were not high enough,

118
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:34,291
they simply found a more interesting way

119
00:06:34,331 --> 00:06:35,452
to traverse the level.

120
00:06:35,952 --> 00:06:38,014
They could simply switch to another path.

121
00:06:42,993 --> 00:06:45,054
What if they followed a path, then got stuck,

122
00:06:45,534 --> 00:06:48,035
for whatever reason, without the necessary abilities

123
00:06:48,095 --> 00:06:51,457
to successfully switch to any other play style path?

124
00:06:53,277 --> 00:06:57,659
So to avoid such situations, we also added a fail safe.

125
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,741
That is the generic path, which was

126
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:02,361
free from any skill checks.

127
00:07:07,006 --> 00:07:13,088
The generic path would be our fallback to ensure players could always progress down the critical path.

128
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:17,589
This was super important to us because we pride ourselves on being storytellers,

129
00:07:17,810 --> 00:07:22,491
and we did not want a lack of a player's foresight to get in the way of them experiencing our narrative.

130
00:07:23,751 --> 00:07:25,852
And to encourage better use of play styles,

131
00:07:26,172 --> 00:07:29,613
we also decided that the generic path should always be the most difficult one.

132
00:07:30,887 --> 00:07:34,288
Now, this would often end up clashing with our storytelling requirements,

133
00:07:34,548 --> 00:07:38,490
because it's often easiest to construct a great narrative around the one path

134
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:42,351
that all players can pass, no matter how they build their character.

135
00:07:43,491 --> 00:07:46,772
And as a result of the generic path being the most difficult one,

136
00:07:47,132 --> 00:07:51,094
conversely, playstyle paths would provide the least resistance,

137
00:07:51,514 --> 00:07:54,435
contributing to the power fantasy they should provide to players.

138
00:07:58,745 --> 00:08:01,345
And this is how that would look like on an actual level.

139
00:08:02,106 --> 00:08:04,206
This is a gig location I had the opportunity

140
00:08:04,226 --> 00:08:06,707
to create the base blockout for early in the game's

141
00:08:06,747 --> 00:08:07,267
development.

142
00:08:07,847 --> 00:08:11,028
And because of that, it reflects our initial design assumptions

143
00:08:11,188 --> 00:08:11,749
really well.

144
00:08:12,749 --> 00:08:15,330
And you can think of a gig as a relatively brief type

145
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:17,230
of handcrafted open world mission.

146
00:08:18,711 --> 00:08:19,111
First off.

147
00:08:20,112 --> 00:08:21,912
The generic stealth and combat path.

148
00:08:22,453 --> 00:08:26,695
Here, they actually coincide, with stealth mostly being focused on waiting for opportune

149
00:08:26,775 --> 00:08:29,096
timing windows to bypass enemy patrols.

150
00:08:31,157 --> 00:08:35,699
Using double jump, the solo can infiltrate the area through an alternative entrance and

151
00:08:35,819 --> 00:08:37,040
smoothly reach the goal.

152
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:38,681
That's probably hard to see on these, but...

153
00:08:40,672 --> 00:08:41,312
It is what it is.

154
00:08:43,415 --> 00:08:46,378
The Netrunner can hack devices and manipulate enemies

155
00:08:46,418 --> 00:08:49,461
to create distractions to create their own timing windows.

156
00:08:50,302 --> 00:08:52,424
Back then, we used hackable devices

157
00:08:52,504 --> 00:08:55,948
like a tray of breadcrumbs to lead the Netrunner's way.

158
00:08:57,710 --> 00:08:58,291
And finally.

159
00:08:59,363 --> 00:09:03,066
The techie who could break in and use a completely different route altogether.

160
00:09:03,966 --> 00:09:08,489
Techies initially had their own custom mechanic planned, but in practice it played too closely

161
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:09,790
to the Netrunner's playstyle.

162
00:09:10,571 --> 00:09:14,454
And in the end, we couldn't really find and afford a meaningful difference between these

163
00:09:14,494 --> 00:09:19,097
two playstyles, which led to the techie being downscoped in importance to a more supporting

164
00:09:19,137 --> 00:09:21,519
playstyle as opposed to his own full archetype.

165
00:09:25,387 --> 00:09:29,172
I also had the pleasure to be part of content team number two.

166
00:09:29,913 --> 00:09:32,256
And my team members were incredible without exception,

167
00:09:32,396 --> 00:09:35,139
and together we were responsible for bringing the Judy quest

168
00:09:35,159 --> 00:09:35,740
line to life.

169
00:09:36,681 --> 00:09:38,343
This is an example from the final game

170
00:09:38,383 --> 00:09:41,287
of our play styles in action on one of my locations, which

171
00:09:41,307 --> 00:09:44,331
we internally refer to as the Braindance Studio.

172
00:09:48,368 --> 00:09:52,513
As a level designer, I was responsible for both the design and implementation of the

173
00:09:52,553 --> 00:09:55,858
location itself, as well as the implementation of the encounters.

174
00:10:18,370 --> 00:10:40,346
Ready? Expect the unexpected!

175
00:10:41,627 --> 00:10:41,847
What?

176
00:11:02,935 --> 00:11:04,676
Got the blueprint. Be there in a sec.

177
00:11:07,857 --> 00:11:10,117
And here is actually the Brain.in studio

178
00:11:10,157 --> 00:11:11,698
played in a completely different way.

179
00:11:12,478 --> 00:11:14,938
While designing and implementing encounters such as these,

180
00:11:15,158 --> 00:11:17,379
we constantly had to balance the different play styles

181
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:20,680
and adjust our scripting to make sure all possibilities

182
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,620
were playing in concert with each other.

183
00:11:32,128 --> 00:11:33,375
First shot, he's still alive?

184
00:11:34,139 --> 00:11:36,030
I'm here! Got no time to creep around!

185
00:12:10,088 --> 00:12:14,752
Now, NPC behavior would need to adjust to a sudden combat situation, which in theory

186
00:12:14,852 --> 00:12:18,535
as you can see could occur at any time and at any moment of an encounter like this.

187
00:12:19,463 --> 00:12:23,326
While our AI is able to handle a wide variety of situations reasonably well,

188
00:12:23,446 --> 00:12:27,568
thanks to our great work of our gameplay designers and programmers,

189
00:12:28,289 --> 00:12:30,770
in order to make sure our combat always felt right,

190
00:12:31,410 --> 00:12:33,732
enemies would, for example, need to position themselves

191
00:12:33,792 --> 00:12:37,494
towards where we wanted the player to go relative to the player's position.

192
00:12:38,295 --> 00:12:40,836
Basically, what I'm trying to say is that we often had to script

193
00:12:40,896 --> 00:12:44,698
not just the stealth sequences, but also multiple combat scenarios.

194
00:12:48,218 --> 00:12:50,560
All right. So that didn't look so bad.

195
00:12:51,781 --> 00:12:54,724
I actually recall once walking past one of our testers

196
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,326
using our bullet time ability, Sandivistan,

197
00:12:57,726 --> 00:12:59,027
very much a combat skill,

198
00:12:59,407 --> 00:13:01,449
to bypass patrols while stealthing.

199
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:04,712
Another time, I saw a really good friend of mine

200
00:13:04,812 --> 00:13:06,133
force his way into a building

201
00:13:06,293 --> 00:13:08,174
for which he did not have the proper techie skill

202
00:13:08,555 --> 00:13:11,077
by punching a hole into a window with his bare fists

203
00:13:11,197 --> 00:13:12,638
over the course of a whole minute.

204
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,181
Things looked really promising. So let's ship it.

205
00:13:19,100 --> 00:13:21,030
Now the joke is about to come, Sean, don't laugh yet.

206
00:13:28,499 --> 00:13:32,500
Now, the launch of Cyberpunk 2077 was really rough.

207
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,721
I'm sure many of you in here can relate to me

208
00:13:35,741 --> 00:13:38,861
when I say that making games such as Cyberpunk 2077

209
00:13:39,442 --> 00:13:41,782
is truly a dream come true, at least for me.

210
00:13:42,762 --> 00:13:44,723
And I'm proud to always give it my all

211
00:13:44,783 --> 00:13:48,004
to help do my part in realizing the wonderfully ambitious

212
00:13:48,044 --> 00:13:49,904
and demanding projects we work on at CDPR.

213
00:13:51,713 --> 00:13:53,254
Pouring your heart into a project,

214
00:13:53,455 --> 00:13:55,477
and then having it cause so much disappointment

215
00:13:55,537 --> 00:13:57,939
despite your best efforts, is crushing.

216
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:00,142
And my heart goes out to all the devs

217
00:14:00,362 --> 00:14:02,044
who have gone through similar experiences.

218
00:14:04,266 --> 00:14:06,889
But you trip, you get back up.

219
00:14:07,774 --> 00:14:10,135
In 2013, I started out in an environment

220
00:14:10,175 --> 00:14:13,097
where we wanted to prove that this small Polish developer

221
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,359
could redefine open world RPGs.

222
00:14:15,799 --> 00:14:18,080
And as a team, we were now back to wanting

223
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:20,102
to prove that we're serious about learning

224
00:14:20,142 --> 00:14:21,463
from our mistakes and doing better.

225
00:14:22,563 --> 00:14:25,005
It took us a few patches to finally gain some insight

226
00:14:25,045 --> 00:14:28,227
into how fruitful our efforts from level design perspective

227
00:14:28,427 --> 00:14:28,988
actually were.

228
00:14:29,548 --> 00:14:31,970
And overall, it was pretty decent.

229
00:14:34,005 --> 00:14:36,426
Players were happy to experiment with their play styles.

230
00:14:36,707 --> 00:14:38,888
We even added a respec mechanic post-launch

231
00:14:38,928 --> 00:14:40,729
to help them experiment even more.

232
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:45,313
And also, the balance between validity of play styles

233
00:14:45,353 --> 00:14:47,194
was also pretty good. So there was no,

234
00:14:47,274 --> 00:14:49,115
you know, like dominant place over the other.

235
00:14:49,195 --> 00:14:51,637
Everyone was happy playing just what they wanted to play.

236
00:14:53,018 --> 00:14:55,440
And of course, we saw people play in ways

237
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,781
we had not anticipated.

238
00:14:56,801 --> 00:15:00,443
To me, using throwing knives or silenced pistols

239
00:15:00,763 --> 00:15:03,265
to distract enemies was one of these examples.

240
00:15:04,548 --> 00:15:06,730
However, highly ambitious as we were,

241
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:08,991
we couldn't help but notice some criticism

242
00:15:09,091 --> 00:15:10,172
that kept coming up.

243
00:15:11,553 --> 00:15:13,775
One was that players didn't really

244
00:15:13,895 --> 00:15:18,117
feel like whatever play style they picked mattered that much.

245
00:15:19,058 --> 00:15:21,139
The experience wouldn't actually drastically change.

246
00:15:21,960 --> 00:15:23,861
And I have a suspicion that sentiment

247
00:15:24,241 --> 00:15:27,684
may have gotten even worse after we added that simple respect

248
00:15:27,744 --> 00:15:28,084
mechanic.

249
00:15:29,797 --> 00:15:32,317
Now, it turns out, though, that on closer inspection,

250
00:15:32,758 --> 00:15:35,438
this problem was pretty complex, and LD

251
00:15:35,638 --> 00:15:37,259
was only one part of the equation.

252
00:15:38,199 --> 00:15:41,901
We also would need to evaluate how our perk system itself

253
00:15:42,021 --> 00:15:44,882
and even our own design mentality affected the problem.

254
00:15:46,022 --> 00:15:48,543
That is, when it comes to encounters on quests,

255
00:15:49,103 --> 00:15:50,443
we basically were trying to create

256
00:15:50,523 --> 00:15:54,465
multiple highly polished linear experiences as opposed

257
00:15:54,485 --> 00:15:57,066
to interwoven ones, where it's up to the player

258
00:15:57,126 --> 00:15:58,046
how much they experience.

259
00:15:59,365 --> 00:16:01,727
If there was a cool or important thing along the path,

260
00:16:02,067 --> 00:16:03,749
we really didn't want the player to suffer

261
00:16:03,789 --> 00:16:06,292
a diminished experience because they missed it.

262
00:16:07,813 --> 00:16:11,177
Also, you guys should have seen my Twitter inbox.

263
00:16:12,558 --> 00:16:14,380
Some of them creatively compared our work

264
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,322
to having combined noodles and raisins.

265
00:16:17,043 --> 00:16:21,387
And waking up to that on launch day was truly something.

266
00:16:22,565 --> 00:16:27,013
Jokes aside though, the positive outlook here is that despite it all, people really

267
00:16:27,094 --> 00:16:32,264
cared about the quality of our work, and now it was on us to show them that we did too.

268
00:16:35,775 --> 00:16:36,075
All right.

269
00:16:37,215 --> 00:16:39,135
So learning from mistakes and doing better.

270
00:16:39,956 --> 00:16:42,176
Becoming better starts with understanding

271
00:16:42,336 --> 00:16:43,416
one's own shortcomings.

272
00:16:43,977 --> 00:16:47,417
And in spring 2022, our level design team

273
00:16:47,477 --> 00:16:48,418
set itself a mission.

274
00:16:49,298 --> 00:16:51,658
We wanted to evaluate what we could reasonably

275
00:16:51,738 --> 00:16:54,539
fix in patches or what we may want to look at

276
00:16:54,619 --> 00:16:55,859
to do better in the future.

277
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,920
And on that note, I know the Project Orion team

278
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,500
is hiring for our Boston studio.

279
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,581
And you can find our devs here running around.

280
00:17:02,641 --> 00:17:04,962
So if you're interested in that, feel free to catch them.

281
00:17:06,497 --> 00:17:09,058
Okay, to figure out what we level designers should do,

282
00:17:09,558 --> 00:17:11,099
the team internally kicked off

283
00:17:11,419 --> 00:17:12,840
a research and development project.

284
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:17,382
Every LD would try to find one level design-related problem

285
00:17:17,562 --> 00:17:22,264
in Cyberpunk 2077, analyze it, propose a solution,

286
00:17:22,424 --> 00:17:24,585
and present that to the team for further discussion.

287
00:17:27,706 --> 00:17:30,448
And so, I embarked on a new mission.

288
00:17:31,868 --> 00:17:34,610
The problem I wanted to research was the following.

289
00:17:36,447 --> 00:17:40,969
Level design in Cyberpunk 2077 is focused on supporting various playstyles

290
00:17:41,029 --> 00:17:44,250
by providing branching of the nonlinear designs.

291
00:17:45,250 --> 00:17:49,332
Yet, since launch, we have learned that players don't feel like playstyles

292
00:17:49,352 --> 00:17:51,153
and perks they commit to matter much.

293
00:17:52,674 --> 00:17:56,115
Other games feature less varied perks, less options,

294
00:17:56,655 --> 00:17:59,436
and yet those games seem to have succeeded where we have not.

295
00:18:01,717 --> 00:18:03,958
My mission objectives then were the following.

296
00:18:05,219 --> 00:18:11,764
First, I wanted to gain insight into how our level design contributes negatively to the feeling of playstyles not mattering.

297
00:18:12,945 --> 00:18:20,011
And then, I wanted to use that information to improve future designs to enhance the feeling of playstyles mattering and being fun.

298
00:18:24,055 --> 00:18:28,859
So with the problem and my mission clearly stated, it was time to come up with a plan.

299
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:32,341
My initial hunch was to go back to the formula

300
00:18:32,701 --> 00:18:34,001
and with the wisdom of hindsight,

301
00:18:34,221 --> 00:18:36,441
revisit and analyze the games that inspired us

302
00:18:36,501 --> 00:18:37,202
in the first place.

303
00:18:39,562 --> 00:18:42,462
These were games such as Arkane's Dishonored 1 and 2,

304
00:18:43,023 --> 00:18:44,743
Rocksteady's Batman Arkham series,

305
00:18:45,203 --> 00:18:47,483
and of course, Iron Storm's original Deus Ex,

306
00:18:47,863 --> 00:18:50,804
as well as Eidos' follow-ups, and many more.

307
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,805
Now then, I wanted to dissect our work more closely

308
00:18:55,845 --> 00:18:57,825
in hopes of finding out the differences that

309
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,285
may contribute to our problem.

310
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:04,168
My hope was that I could then formulate a set of principles

311
00:19:04,669 --> 00:19:06,429
based on what I would find, which we could

312
00:19:06,529 --> 00:19:08,150
use to improve our future work.

313
00:19:09,691 --> 00:19:12,111
And to further validate these principles,

314
00:19:12,492 --> 00:19:15,553
I want to apply them theoretically simply

315
00:19:15,593 --> 00:19:16,633
to see what would happen.

316
00:19:23,316 --> 00:19:25,937
So since I'm in love with the games that I mentioned before,

317
00:19:26,897 --> 00:19:29,138
it would be easy for me to get excited and simply go,

318
00:19:29,498 --> 00:19:30,018
all right, guys.

319
00:19:31,156 --> 00:19:33,840
We just need to build levels exactly like these guys do.

320
00:19:34,921 --> 00:19:38,947
Annoying myself, I decided to do a little reality check after replaying them.

321
00:19:40,610 --> 00:19:41,031
First off...

322
00:19:42,939 --> 00:19:45,241
We put our narrative first.

323
00:19:45,722 --> 00:19:47,825
It's our trademark, and everything we do

324
00:19:47,925 --> 00:19:49,607
is meant to contribute to telling

325
00:19:49,647 --> 00:19:52,751
a great story in an open world that feels real

326
00:19:52,891 --> 00:19:55,114
and affords the player many freedoms.

327
00:19:55,414 --> 00:19:57,477
With, for example, no loading screens,

328
00:19:58,078 --> 00:20:00,741
which meant that building exteriors and interiors always

329
00:20:00,801 --> 00:20:01,382
had to match.

330
00:20:02,972 --> 00:20:05,493
Secondly, because of the size of our world,

331
00:20:05,974 --> 00:20:07,694
we need to make a ton of content.

332
00:20:08,335 --> 00:20:11,076
Cyberpunk 2077 features more than 85 gigs,

333
00:20:11,516 --> 00:20:14,578
almost 40 main missions, and more than 25 side missions,

334
00:20:14,998 --> 00:20:17,299
most of which feature one or multiple

335
00:20:17,319 --> 00:20:19,000
bespoke custom locations.

336
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:23,322
And thirdly, because of these first two points,

337
00:20:23,702 --> 00:20:25,503
we can always brute force a solution

338
00:20:25,543 --> 00:20:27,824
by simply providing completely different paths

339
00:20:28,164 --> 00:20:29,645
which individually would compare

340
00:20:30,125 --> 00:20:31,966
to a single level in our game.

341
00:20:33,707 --> 00:20:40,371
So that meant whatever principles I wanted to form should consider our production reality

342
00:20:40,891 --> 00:20:45,815
and thus be broken down enough so that we could apply them even on a smaller scale.

343
00:20:47,115 --> 00:20:52,999
And now if this seems like a relatively well put together plan, the reality is that I had

344
00:20:53,259 --> 00:20:57,482
no clue what I was going to find or if any of this would result in anything meaningful.

345
00:20:58,363 --> 00:21:00,024
But onward we march.

346
00:21:02,302 --> 00:21:06,164
And I found two major issues that kept repeating throughout our levels.

347
00:21:06,724 --> 00:21:10,306
It's not like all of them were affected by both of these issues in the same way,

348
00:21:10,666 --> 00:21:14,649
but it's happened often enough that on closer inspection, it was definitely noticeable.

349
00:21:16,510 --> 00:21:21,193
To make sure the generic path was a reliable fallback, we often made it super obvious,

350
00:21:21,373 --> 00:21:24,995
and this resulted in us inadvertently streamlining the experience to the point where,

351
00:21:25,055 --> 00:21:29,818
yes, the generic path was the fallback, but it also became the most obvious one.

352
00:21:31,549 --> 00:21:37,013
Why pick a play style path when the generic solution is so close, easy to reach, and obvious?

353
00:21:38,874 --> 00:21:43,757
Certainly, our guidance systems with paths to objectives being displayed on the mini-map

354
00:21:43,918 --> 00:21:45,559
also didn't do us many favors here.

355
00:21:49,401 --> 00:21:54,765
The other issue I kept finding was related to how we seed cool optional content. If you take

356
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:59,208
a look at Dishonored 2, for example, and here, shout out to the team over at Arkane,

357
00:21:59,910 --> 00:22:01,030
We're big fans of your work.

358
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,951
We see that as soon as the player actually

359
00:22:04,051 --> 00:22:06,852
moves from the golden path, they are bound

360
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,492
to run into some cool things.

361
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:12,213
This is a cool way to reward players with unique experience.

362
00:22:12,593 --> 00:22:15,434
But it also means that depending on which path you pick

363
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,155
and what you find there, the information

364
00:22:18,175 --> 00:22:20,616
the player has about the world can be slightly different.

365
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:25,082
In an effort to make sure that players would experience the best possible narrative,

366
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:29,664
we often would put the coolest and most important things following the generic path,

367
00:22:30,004 --> 00:22:33,346
because this way we could make sure all players would be able to experience it.

368
00:22:36,528 --> 00:22:42,251
This becomes especially obvious and problematic when we look at the way we would utilize skill

369
00:22:42,292 --> 00:22:47,274
checks. For this, we look at a somewhat extreme example, but it is in the game.

370
00:22:48,249 --> 00:22:52,833
In this mission, the player gets in close contact with a new gang, which prides themselves

371
00:22:52,973 --> 00:22:53,954
on their physical strength.

372
00:23:18,804 --> 00:23:23,488
Oh, you think? The runner we want tried to invade you.

373
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:27,952
With the extra eyes we give you, you can always land one like this.

374
00:23:27,992 --> 00:23:30,254
So, he knows I'm here.

375
00:23:31,155 --> 00:23:34,738
This one's got a motion sensor. Only reacts when you move.

376
00:23:35,699 --> 00:23:39,422
New models got muscle memory sims. React to your intention, not your...

377
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:48,278
Following the generic path, me and my intimidatingly skilled colleague Danish

378
00:23:48,298 --> 00:23:53,622
Makievic made sure that you'd see a lot of custom chatter to give a background to this new gang.

379
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,984
It's a cool, it's quite a cool experience actually,

380
00:23:57,384 --> 00:24:00,706
which even features some custom interactions such as this one.

381
00:24:23,128 --> 00:24:27,051
Here you can also see how we somewhat abandoned the one path per playstyle approach.

382
00:24:27,551 --> 00:24:31,194
If you're a netrunner, you don't just want to follow a trail of breadcrumbs with utility

383
00:24:31,254 --> 00:24:35,638
for you, but mess around with devices no matter which path you pick, and same goes for other

384
00:24:35,678 --> 00:24:36,118
playstyles.

385
00:24:51,128 --> 00:24:56,250
Ultimately, we just decided to give people as many cool options as we could fit on the level.

386
00:24:56,950 --> 00:25:00,331
And that worked reasonably well and was also simpler to design for.

387
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:29,493
Oh, oh, oh!

388
00:25:29,773 --> 00:25:32,155
The main hit here. Look for the camionet.

389
00:25:36,419 --> 00:25:39,181
Okay, and we're in the big main hall of this location.

390
00:25:40,402 --> 00:25:45,966
Now, let's see what happens if the player makes use of their invested skills to unlock another passage.

391
00:26:11,925 --> 00:26:14,186
Stay hidden. Beware of Patron.

392
00:26:19,931 --> 00:26:22,914
Yep, and that's the exit of the gym that we just left.

393
00:26:23,454 --> 00:26:30,360
And it's incredible and highlights how sometimes the cost of enhancing the value of invested skills for the player could be quite low.

394
00:26:31,181 --> 00:26:38,247
Imagine if we had chosen to do it the other way around and treat this side passage as the generic path, with the gym being unlocked by a skill check.

395
00:26:39,018 --> 00:26:44,780
That way, your skill check would have unlocked an awesome new section for you, rewarding you with a cool and unique experience.

396
00:26:48,002 --> 00:26:49,263
To summarize our issues, then.

397
00:26:50,043 --> 00:26:59,767
First, our plan to use the generic path as fallback turned into a bit of a trap on execution, resulting in it often being the most obvious solution which players would pick.

398
00:27:00,568 --> 00:27:01,528
Only too happily, that is.

399
00:27:02,703 --> 00:27:08,605
Secondly, oftentimes we would add reward to the challenge generic should provide by also making

400
00:27:08,645 --> 00:27:14,847
it the path with a cool bespoke experience. To fulfill our goal to present a great story,

401
00:27:15,027 --> 00:27:20,308
we tended to cluster all our cool content related to exposition, lore, cool encounters,

402
00:27:20,648 --> 00:27:25,030
secrets, and sometimes even loot at bottlenecks in the level, like in the end.

403
00:27:26,062 --> 00:27:29,024
That in by itself is not such a big problem, actually,

404
00:27:29,325 --> 00:27:32,907
if you only want to create a cool cinematic narrative

405
00:27:32,967 --> 00:27:33,468
experience.

406
00:27:34,869 --> 00:27:37,290
However, looking at it from the perspective

407
00:27:37,350 --> 00:27:41,513
of creating memorable nonlinear experiences in gameplay,

408
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:45,536
it's hard to give real value to play styles with this approach.

409
00:27:49,445 --> 00:27:51,066
Revisiting our initial approach then,

410
00:27:51,446 --> 00:27:53,848
we find that the generic path as fallback

411
00:27:54,328 --> 00:27:56,550
is actually one of the main contributors

412
00:27:56,730 --> 00:28:00,413
of devaluing our paths, because on execution,

413
00:28:00,633 --> 00:28:02,394
it ended up diluting the experience

414
00:28:02,675 --> 00:28:05,217
by overemphasizing streamlining to a fault.

415
00:28:08,599 --> 00:28:11,481
As for the difficulty of the generic and playstyle paths,

416
00:28:12,062 --> 00:28:15,524
our approach resulted in a multitude of skill checks

417
00:28:15,584 --> 00:28:18,106
being used to simply bypass encounters.

418
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:21,655
Which in hindsight, sounds relatively insane.

419
00:28:22,556 --> 00:28:25,517
Players invest their hard-earned attribute in perk points,

420
00:28:25,677 --> 00:28:28,939
and as a reward, they get to experience less of the game.

421
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,481
Well, at least now you guys know where we were coming from.

422
00:28:37,055 --> 00:28:40,977
Equipped with the knowledge of what went wrong, I went back and took a look at many of our

423
00:28:41,037 --> 00:28:45,999
own levels and wondered how we can marry our cinematic storytelling while still providing

424
00:28:46,119 --> 00:28:48,820
varied non-linear experiences in our level.

425
00:28:49,781 --> 00:28:52,462
Truthfully, the outcome of our work wasn't bad.

426
00:28:53,357 --> 00:28:57,139
On the aspect of providing the player rich nonlinear experiences,

427
00:28:57,159 --> 00:28:59,760
it was merely weaker than we had intended.

428
00:29:00,741 --> 00:29:03,502
Based on my comparison between our levels and other games,

429
00:29:03,982 --> 00:29:08,485
I decided to expand on some concepts of what we already knew about nonlinear level design

430
00:29:08,785 --> 00:29:12,727
to also define how we set up the action and reward structure in our levels.

431
00:29:13,427 --> 00:29:16,849
And I call the resulting concept Discovery and Exploration.

432
00:29:19,152 --> 00:29:25,255
Discovery and exploration is a method to structure your level, which expands the concept of analysis

433
00:29:25,695 --> 00:29:30,518
– a beat in which the player observes and formulates their plan – and execution – the

434
00:29:30,578 --> 00:29:32,659
beat in which the player executes their plan.

435
00:29:34,119 --> 00:29:38,762
The concept focuses on setting up choices and providing payoff to give players a more

436
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:41,143
special experience on each path they pick.

437
00:29:42,472 --> 00:29:44,593
And like the concept it is based on,

438
00:29:45,014 --> 00:29:47,555
it consists of two distinct alternating beats,

439
00:29:48,135 --> 00:29:50,177
each with their own characteristics and purpose.

440
00:29:52,638 --> 00:29:55,800
This method focuses on beats as part of the reward structure

441
00:29:55,840 --> 00:29:59,322
of a level, meaning that individual beats can and should

442
00:29:59,402 --> 00:30:00,683
very much still be flavored.

443
00:30:01,343 --> 00:30:03,964
Is it a more combat heavy or the opposite?

444
00:30:04,445 --> 00:30:07,586
Does it include environmental puzzles, secrets, story

445
00:30:07,626 --> 00:30:08,767
exposition, et cetera?

446
00:30:11,633 --> 00:30:15,014
Let's take a closer look at the individual beats starting with the discovery one.

447
00:30:16,195 --> 00:30:23,837
This beat is primarily about the player discovering their options, making their choices, and overcoming

448
00:30:23,997 --> 00:30:24,517
challenges.

449
00:30:25,778 --> 00:30:31,079
Not always, but often, this is where you will use your informative overwatch, so not much

450
00:30:31,159 --> 00:30:31,860
revolution here.

451
00:30:33,298 --> 00:30:35,738
However, from a narrative function perspective,

452
00:30:36,419 --> 00:30:38,299
this is the establishing shot of your location.

453
00:30:38,719 --> 00:30:40,920
It is here that we set the mood and give the player

454
00:30:40,940 --> 00:30:42,120
what they need to know.

455
00:30:43,020 --> 00:30:44,601
It's also where we plant some seeds

456
00:30:44,661 --> 00:30:47,561
to tease what players might find in later parts of the level.

457
00:30:48,682 --> 00:30:52,623
However, it's important to not overspend your budget here.

458
00:30:53,023 --> 00:30:55,584
So it's crucial to not shoot all of your powder

459
00:30:56,124 --> 00:30:57,324
and save some for later.

460
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:01,682
Once the player made their choice

461
00:31:02,142 --> 00:31:04,403
and successfully passed through the discovery area,

462
00:31:04,843 --> 00:31:08,145
they now find themselves in our exploration beat.

463
00:31:09,365 --> 00:31:10,746
And the exploration beat provides

464
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,767
a more intimate and linear experience

465
00:31:13,087 --> 00:31:14,167
compared to discovery.

466
00:31:14,748 --> 00:31:16,629
It does this by narrowing down the level

467
00:31:17,169 --> 00:31:19,470
and what the player can see of the rest of the location,

468
00:31:20,310 --> 00:31:22,371
restricting them to the path they have chosen.

469
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:25,393
The intent is to let the player focus

470
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:29,034
on exploring and experiencing the choice they committed to.

471
00:31:30,108 --> 00:31:33,129
And this beat is less about making new choices

472
00:31:33,689 --> 00:31:36,430
and much more about the consequence of choosing.

473
00:31:36,890 --> 00:31:38,891
It's the payoff for having chosen.

474
00:31:40,491 --> 00:31:44,373
Now, this is the moment for some cool intimate experiences.

475
00:31:44,693 --> 00:31:48,194
World building, puzzles, special encounters, secrets,

476
00:31:48,634 --> 00:31:51,194
expanding on the context of the level's narrative.

477
00:31:51,815 --> 00:31:53,895
Whatever you can think of to make this cool.

478
00:31:57,325 --> 00:32:00,728
As a result, we get two beats which complement each other.

479
00:32:01,649 --> 00:32:06,634
Discovery is all about providing choices and presenting the player with promises of the

480
00:32:06,834 --> 00:32:08,496
awesome that they're about to uncover.

481
00:32:09,497 --> 00:32:11,919
Exploration is where that awesome lives.

482
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:17,945
It's the player experiencing the consequences of their choice of picking a path, and for

483
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:21,568
doing so, exploration rewards the player.

484
00:32:22,708 --> 00:32:24,969
It's not only great from the player's perspective,

485
00:32:25,089 --> 00:32:27,230
but also from ours as storytellers.

486
00:32:27,771 --> 00:32:30,252
This structure allows us to still expose the player

487
00:32:30,272 --> 00:32:32,834
to important narrative elements and cinematic moments

488
00:32:33,294 --> 00:32:34,795
while giving the individual player

489
00:32:34,855 --> 00:32:36,275
a more unique experience.

490
00:32:37,136 --> 00:32:40,658
Used well, the exploration beat can provide more context

491
00:32:40,678 --> 00:32:43,820
for our narrative and build on it and thus enhance it.

492
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:47,222
Nonetheless, this concept works best

493
00:32:47,302 --> 00:32:48,842
the more okay one is with the player

494
00:32:48,882 --> 00:32:50,263
potentially missing cool stuff.

495
00:32:51,288 --> 00:32:56,411
Due to my research, I do genuinely think it is okay for players to miss cool things if

496
00:32:56,511 --> 00:33:03,475
they do it, and only if they do it by experiencing other cool stuff, basically keeping the net

497
00:33:03,555 --> 00:33:04,956
gain for the player in balance.

498
00:33:08,649 --> 00:33:13,492
Let's look at how that concept might look like applied to our level, the Brain Dance Studio.

499
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:19,094
We see that the foundation of analysis and execution are there. Classic level design setup.

500
00:33:20,015 --> 00:33:26,098
One beat to analyze your path from a vantage point, another to get close to the action and execute your plan.

501
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:37,444
When we rethink it with the concept of discovery and exploration, the beat setup changes to focus on providing choices and promising rewards, then granting them.

502
00:33:38,470 --> 00:33:43,692
We still apply the same theory of analysis and execution in Discovery, but our focus changes.

503
00:33:44,272 --> 00:33:49,174
From this perspective, there's actually room for improvement mainly in the payoff the Exploration

504
00:33:49,214 --> 00:33:53,775
Beat provides. More on that in a minute. Please try to make a mental note here.

505
00:33:56,416 --> 00:34:01,118
I mentioned earlier that as part of my mission, I wanted to find a set of useful principles to

506
00:34:01,158 --> 00:34:05,119
help make different paths feel more special. And I did!

507
00:34:06,307 --> 00:34:11,030
In addition to discovery and exploration, these principles are widely applicable, even

508
00:34:11,091 --> 00:34:15,934
on smaller levels, and through specific actions a level designer might use these to improve

509
00:34:16,155 --> 00:34:17,155
on their designs.

510
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:22,860
Our first of three principles I want to share with you focuses on the proximity of different

511
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,421
paths in a level to each other.

512
00:34:27,804 --> 00:34:30,246
Take a look at these two entrances if you can see them.

513
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:35,941
This is a bit of an extreme example, but even though the player has a choice here,

514
00:34:36,421 --> 00:34:39,042
does it really feel like a choice worth making?

515
00:34:39,922 --> 00:34:44,083
The proximity of these two entrances leaves little room for mystery as to whether these

516
00:34:44,183 --> 00:34:50,445
paths are actually any different. Remember the BrainNance Studio from earlier and how I

517
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:55,306
mentioned the exploration beat needing improvement? Well, here we're actually looking at it.

518
00:34:56,347 --> 00:35:00,408
White represents the intended generic paths, and green are the play-styled paths.

519
00:35:01,414 --> 00:35:04,897
What happens is that even when we apply vertical distance to a path,

520
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:08,059
as long as the paths are close to each other,

521
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:13,383
they're still perceived as the same path because the proximity results in them running

522
00:35:13,483 --> 00:35:16,966
vertically parallel to each other. And in part to this,

523
00:35:17,246 --> 00:35:21,309
the exploration bead fails to provide meaningful rewards by making

524
00:35:21,509 --> 00:35:24,211
each choice result in a very similar payoff.

525
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:31,651
So principle number one, then, the perception of distance.

526
00:35:32,411 --> 00:35:35,332
This principle tries to give the players the perception

527
00:35:35,652 --> 00:35:36,992
that they have a choice to make.

528
00:35:37,472 --> 00:35:38,892
Which path do I pick?

529
00:35:40,033 --> 00:35:41,953
The closer paths are to each other,

530
00:35:42,953 --> 00:35:45,834
the less it feels like picking one actually makes a difference.

531
00:35:47,035 --> 00:35:50,415
And while verticality can be a valid way of creating distances

532
00:35:50,555 --> 00:35:54,316
for entrances, the same cannot be said about the paths

533
00:35:54,356 --> 00:35:54,757
themselves.

534
00:35:56,018 --> 00:35:58,740
It's important that your paths are perceived by players

535
00:35:58,840 --> 00:36:01,182
as being distanced to each other to enhance

536
00:36:01,222 --> 00:36:02,683
the feeling of them being different

537
00:36:02,803 --> 00:36:04,444
and leading to different outcomes.

538
00:36:05,444 --> 00:36:08,406
On the extreme end, this is why having completely different

539
00:36:08,446 --> 00:36:10,147
paths through a location is so cool,

540
00:36:10,627 --> 00:36:12,248
but potentially very expensive.

541
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:17,592
So, what can we as level designers do

542
00:36:17,652 --> 00:36:19,653
to enhance a player's perception of distance

543
00:36:19,713 --> 00:36:20,994
between paths and entrances?

544
00:36:21,871 --> 00:36:28,215
Well, generally, try to design entrances and paths as far away from each other as reasonably possible.

545
00:36:28,855 --> 00:36:29,475
Kind of makes sense.

546
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:35,139
However, it's not so much about the actual distance between the paths as much as it is

547
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:36,860
about the perceived distance.

548
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:42,283
That means, anything that can help make paths feel distant from each other, like building

549
00:36:42,343 --> 00:36:47,066
a layout in which visibility is limited, setting up encounters or skill checks to make access

550
00:36:47,106 --> 00:36:49,387
to the paths more difficult, can also help.

551
00:36:51,048 --> 00:36:54,952
Generally, I recommend a quality over quantity approach,

552
00:36:55,352 --> 00:36:56,894
especially in smaller locations where

553
00:36:56,914 --> 00:36:58,516
it may be hard to properly distance

554
00:36:58,576 --> 00:36:59,617
many paths from each other.

555
00:37:00,498 --> 00:37:03,361
Rather, have two that have a high perception of distance,

556
00:37:04,101 --> 00:37:05,883
then three which are too close to each other.

557
00:37:10,741 --> 00:37:12,962
In the setup here, you can see a typical example

558
00:37:12,982 --> 00:37:15,743
of a playstyle entrance allowing for a separate access

559
00:37:15,763 --> 00:37:16,443
to a location.

560
00:37:17,063 --> 00:37:18,944
This in by itself is fine, but if we

561
00:37:18,964 --> 00:37:20,604
look at the flow of the paths, we

562
00:37:20,644 --> 00:37:22,965
can see that the way the location is built,

563
00:37:25,666 --> 00:37:27,566
the initial question of, I wonder

564
00:37:27,606 --> 00:37:30,767
where that other path may go, is revealed to the player

565
00:37:30,807 --> 00:37:33,548
without them ever actually having to use that path.

566
00:37:34,789 --> 00:37:38,270
It exposes that in the end, the path they pick really

567
00:37:38,310 --> 00:37:39,390
did not matter all that much.

568
00:37:40,548 --> 00:37:43,490
So while principle number one tries to build choice,

569
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:47,351
principle number two focuses on building, and more importantly,

570
00:37:47,771 --> 00:37:50,912
maintaining an air of mystery around the choices.

571
00:37:53,253 --> 00:37:55,174
Through principle number one, the player

572
00:37:55,194 --> 00:37:57,054
becomes aware that they need to make a choice.

573
00:37:57,714 --> 00:38:00,495
Principle number two, a perception of exclusivity,

574
00:38:00,856 --> 00:38:03,176
prevents them from knowing the alternative outcome

575
00:38:03,537 --> 00:38:05,197
and heightens a sense of wonder.

576
00:38:06,783 --> 00:38:11,788
The more exclusive and isolated a path feels, the more special it can become in the player's mind.

577
00:38:12,589 --> 00:38:20,117
Without a perception of exclusivity, we destroy all chances of players to even wonder whether another path might result in a different outcome.

578
00:38:21,478 --> 00:38:29,727
Through perception of exclusivity, we can also allow a player to fully focus on the experience provided from the path they picked and

579
00:38:31,103 --> 00:38:33,425
This in turn heightens a player's curiosity

580
00:38:33,485 --> 00:38:35,547
about the possible alternative outcomes

581
00:38:35,888 --> 00:38:37,109
they could have experienced.

582
00:38:40,973 --> 00:38:44,556
As a level designer, how do I make my paths feel more exclusive,

583
00:38:44,917 --> 00:38:46,258
especially if I'm on a tight budget?

584
00:38:47,699 --> 00:38:50,222
One of the most cost-effective ways I found to increase

585
00:38:50,262 --> 00:38:52,144
a perception of exclusivity for players

586
00:38:52,544 --> 00:38:55,167
is to limit and control what a player can see.

587
00:38:56,243 --> 00:39:00,526
That means breaking line of sight of the player

588
00:39:00,566 --> 00:39:02,948
to alternative paths and entrances

589
00:39:03,028 --> 00:39:05,809
to prevent them from figuring out how they work

590
00:39:05,930 --> 00:39:07,250
without ever having to use them.

591
00:39:08,951 --> 00:39:13,094
Furthermore, to fully allow the player to focus on the path,

592
00:39:13,334 --> 00:39:15,896
commit them to a choice by using one-way drops and passages.

593
00:39:17,517 --> 00:39:20,398
However, if your game is all about providing freedom

594
00:39:20,438 --> 00:39:23,420
like ours, with little notion of punishing the player,

595
00:39:24,561 --> 00:39:27,603
allow them to switch between paths, but only at a cost.

596
00:39:28,123 --> 00:39:29,584
For example, by making them decide

597
00:39:29,624 --> 00:39:31,645
whether they'd rather stay on the path they picked

598
00:39:32,085 --> 00:39:34,827
or try to sneak past a particularly deadly enemy.

599
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:41,591
All right, principle number three, I think,

600
00:39:41,631 --> 00:39:43,772
is the easiest to understand, but maybe not

601
00:39:44,192 --> 00:39:45,953
such an easy one to commit to.

602
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:56,038
For your own safety, please maintain silence.

603
00:39:56,078 --> 00:39:56,678
How are you, Mr. Steve?

604
00:39:56,698 --> 00:40:02,420
Thank you very much.

605
00:40:03,300 --> 00:40:06,901
Alright guys, don't judge. In 2077, even robots need some love.

606
00:40:09,201 --> 00:40:11,322
I hope you could see that. This landed well.

607
00:40:14,362 --> 00:40:15,323
But onwards we march.

608
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:23,846
Our last principle for today focuses on validating the choices the player made, or rather the

609
00:40:23,906 --> 00:40:24,887
choice the player made.

610
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:30,553
A perception of uniqueness fulfills the player's desire to have made the right choice while

611
00:40:30,593 --> 00:40:34,877
at the same time heightening the stakes and the excitement of making one.

612
00:40:37,223 --> 00:40:40,646
And for that to work, we need to treat our paths as special

613
00:40:40,826 --> 00:40:42,607
and plan proper payoff for players

614
00:40:42,647 --> 00:40:45,289
and be OK with other players potentially missing out.

615
00:40:46,030 --> 00:40:49,272
This is what creates value in the choices players make.

616
00:40:50,933 --> 00:40:53,395
A choice is not interesting without a proper consequence,

617
00:40:53,615 --> 00:40:55,096
or in this case, payoff.

618
00:40:55,697 --> 00:40:57,438
This goes for narrative choices as much

619
00:40:57,818 --> 00:41:00,180
as for ones done in gameplay, like how

620
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,221
we navigate through a level.

621
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,582
The player did their part. They made the choice.

622
00:41:05,002 --> 00:41:08,825
And now it's on us as designers to make it worth their time and give them a show.

623
00:41:12,348 --> 00:41:16,751
Providing a perception of uniqueness is of course done by making sure we allocate budget

624
00:41:16,791 --> 00:41:20,334
and find affordable solutions to give the players exclusive content.

625
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:25,653
And this is really where the individual designers and small teams can shine.

626
00:41:25,673 --> 00:41:31,798
And I'm sure many of you have experienced at least one instance where someone kitbashed

627
00:41:31,838 --> 00:41:34,179
a cool experience out of seemingly nothing.

628
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:37,559
At CDPR, we have so many incredible minds,

629
00:41:37,660 --> 00:41:39,962
especially amongst our quest and open world designers,

630
00:41:40,242 --> 00:41:41,223
who excel at this.

631
00:41:42,023 --> 00:41:44,906
One of those guys is actually Pavel Sasko over there,

632
00:41:44,966 --> 00:41:45,887
our quest director.

633
00:41:46,527 --> 00:41:48,189
Thanks to him and some others,

634
00:41:48,669 --> 00:41:51,832
we can have Nibbles and Iguana as a pet in the game.

635
00:41:52,592 --> 00:41:55,795
Side note, my friend Pavel will be holding a talk tomorrow

636
00:41:56,156 --> 00:41:57,617
that you should definitely check out.

637
00:41:58,237 --> 00:42:00,459
In it, he also outlines how we design

638
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:02,841
impactful narrative choices for players.

639
00:42:04,994 --> 00:42:07,416
Alright, getting back to providing cool experiences.

640
00:42:07,876 --> 00:42:13,841
We even created a whole type of content in Cyberpunk 2077 we lovingly call Mini World

641
00:42:13,901 --> 00:42:18,526
Stories that gives individual designers the room to mess around and increase the perception

642
00:42:18,546 --> 00:42:22,289
of uniqueness while at the same time breathing more life into our world.

643
00:42:22,749 --> 00:42:23,970
Like the dancing robots.

644
00:42:24,591 --> 00:42:26,633
Or the car bomb encounter for those of you who know it.

645
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:35,104
As for level designers, in addition to providing cool, unique set pieces and visual storytelling,

646
00:42:35,384 --> 00:42:41,308
perhaps a cool custom encounter, we can also build our locations in a way that we prevent

647
00:42:41,468 --> 00:42:44,050
bottlenecks ending in the same room.

648
00:42:45,031 --> 00:42:50,774
Seeing the exit of another path may remind that it is there and make you wonder, but

649
00:42:50,814 --> 00:42:55,237
it also ultimately tells you that, in the end, all paths lead to Rome.

650
00:42:57,030 --> 00:43:01,111
There's more gain in masking this and hiding away those entrances

651
00:43:01,171 --> 00:43:03,871
to instead keep the player wondering after the fact,

652
00:43:04,391 --> 00:43:06,432
wait, there used to be another path.

653
00:43:07,012 --> 00:43:07,872
I wonder where that went.

654
00:43:11,473 --> 00:43:13,914
As you can see, much like discovery and exploration,

655
00:43:14,234 --> 00:43:16,514
these principles complement and build on each other.

656
00:43:17,414 --> 00:43:19,415
Theory is good, however, but often it

657
00:43:19,455 --> 00:43:21,135
can be hard to imagine how it translates

658
00:43:21,175 --> 00:43:22,456
into practical use cases.

659
00:43:23,356 --> 00:43:25,036
I mentioned at the beginning I wanted to apply

660
00:43:25,076 --> 00:43:26,556
these principles to validate them.

661
00:43:27,715 --> 00:43:28,335
So let's do that.

662
00:43:30,716 --> 00:43:33,658
This is a top-down shot from an experimental blockout

663
00:43:33,698 --> 00:43:35,579
I created for research purposes.

664
00:43:36,300 --> 00:43:38,321
It was created before I started out

665
00:43:38,781 --> 00:43:41,623
on my research and development project, and you can tell.

666
00:43:43,184 --> 00:43:45,685
White paths are the generic play styles.

667
00:43:45,925 --> 00:43:48,507
In the middle, we have the combat one, and above,

668
00:43:48,747 --> 00:43:50,828
in the north, we have the stealth one.

669
00:43:51,846 --> 00:43:57,330
Green paths are play styles, the numbers are entrances to the level, and the letters are

670
00:43:57,450 --> 00:44:00,052
exits or goals leading to a lower floor.

671
00:44:01,433 --> 00:44:07,318
Just as before, blue zones are discovery beats, and orange ones exploration, though, admittedly,

672
00:44:07,558 --> 00:44:10,641
I did not think about them like that at the time of the making of that blockout.

673
00:44:12,082 --> 00:44:14,263
And again, all the symptoms are here.

674
00:44:14,984 --> 00:44:17,126
There's very low payoff for play style paths.

675
00:44:18,002 --> 00:44:24,268
Principle number one, perception of distance, is violated with the playstyle up above, compared to the generic stealth path.

676
00:44:25,609 --> 00:44:31,474
We also violate principle number two, perception of exclusivity.

677
00:44:32,175 --> 00:44:40,161
Starting at entrance number two, players will inevitably see where entrance number one, basically if they hadn't used their skill check, would have started.

678
00:44:43,750 --> 00:44:48,237
Now, equipped with what I had learned, I set out to apply the beats and principles.

679
00:44:48,858 --> 00:44:53,265
The second iteration of this blockout sees a small section added to the bottom right

680
00:44:53,325 --> 00:44:57,331
corner and additional passages down to the lower floor.

681
00:45:02,613 --> 00:45:04,735
But let's get through this step by step.

682
00:45:05,336 --> 00:45:06,617
First, the beat breakdown.

683
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,859
You can see now the distribution between discovery

684
00:45:09,879 --> 00:45:12,541
and exploration is quite a bit more even,

685
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:15,664
and we have room to provide meaningful rewards.

686
00:45:18,867 --> 00:45:22,329
I added additional ways for the players down to the lower floor

687
00:45:22,550 --> 00:45:24,351
with no direct line of sight to each other,

688
00:45:24,691 --> 00:45:26,833
even leading up to the passages themselves.

689
00:45:27,837 --> 00:45:31,759
At the time the player reaches any of the passages A, B, or C,

690
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:36,321
they will have been locked into their more linear exploration beat for quite a while,

691
00:45:36,721 --> 00:45:39,223
increasing the perception of exclusivity.

692
00:45:41,084 --> 00:45:47,387
In adding the new section, I tried to enhance the perception of distance of the choices the player has in the discovery beat

693
00:45:47,807 --> 00:45:52,489
by moving the entrances to the exploration beats as far from each other as possible.

694
00:45:56,117 --> 00:46:00,701
I also changed the setup of the paths with the generic path now leading straight through

695
00:46:00,742 --> 00:46:01,783
the middle of the section.

696
00:46:02,603 --> 00:46:09,431
At almost no additional cost, I turned the path going from 1 to B into a playstyle exclusive,

697
00:46:09,831 --> 00:46:15,257
while also providing a playstyle exclusive branch to enter lower floor access C of the

698
00:46:15,297 --> 00:46:17,239
generic stealth path going from 2 to A.

699
00:46:19,330 --> 00:46:21,372
The new section actually looks bigger than it is here.

700
00:46:21,772 --> 00:46:23,894
It's effectively one room and two corridors,

701
00:46:24,094 --> 00:46:27,277
plus the branch, so again, relatively low cost.

702
00:46:28,898 --> 00:46:31,200
Now, let's bring some nuance into this,

703
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:33,922
since I had this discussion with some of my fellow level designers

704
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:35,283
after getting feedback from them.

705
00:46:36,003 --> 00:46:37,865
While it's important to make sure vision

706
00:46:37,905 --> 00:46:39,746
doesn't give away how paths work,

707
00:46:40,367 --> 00:46:44,530
we can and should still carefully and consciously work with it

708
00:46:44,890 --> 00:46:47,352
to help the player, of course, build a mental map

709
00:46:47,432 --> 00:46:48,653
and navigate the space better.

710
00:46:49,816 --> 00:46:55,019
In each exploration beat, the player is able to take a peek at the room in the center of this location,

711
00:46:55,379 --> 00:47:03,423
which features a characteristic landmark to help the player understand a bit how they're moving around the location on the path they've picked.

712
00:47:04,383 --> 00:47:07,925
You also have an opportunity to do this when using the hidden passage C.

713
00:47:09,446 --> 00:47:14,808
The vision here provided, however, does not give away how the alternate paths may work.

714
00:47:16,638 --> 00:47:19,020
Finally, let's take a look at the lower floor

715
00:47:19,120 --> 00:47:22,022
to see how the passages enter into that space.

716
00:47:22,882 --> 00:47:25,244
Here, the letters are simply the continuation

717
00:47:25,284 --> 00:47:26,986
of the exits on the floor above.

718
00:47:30,308 --> 00:47:33,410
Notice how none of the paths end in the bottleneck that

719
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:34,751
is the discovery zone here.

720
00:47:35,252 --> 00:47:37,313
From none of the entrances into the area,

721
00:47:37,433 --> 00:47:39,615
can you actually see any of the other options

722
00:47:39,975 --> 00:47:40,936
the player could have taken?

723
00:47:45,379 --> 00:47:49,430
Now, these were the beats and applying principle number one and principle number two.

724
00:47:49,811 --> 00:47:52,999
What about principle number three, the perception of uniqueness?

725
00:47:53,830 --> 00:47:58,315
Well, with the new section added and the northernmost path being turned into a playstyle path,

726
00:47:58,815 --> 00:48:01,658
I now had the room to enhance the perception of uniqueness.

727
00:48:02,419 --> 00:48:08,004
And let's take a brief tour across the level to see how the location itself tries to give the player unique experiences

728
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:13,629
and zones to explore, starting with the generic stealth path with the playstyle exclusive branch,

729
00:48:13,910 --> 00:48:15,771
so Entrance 2 to Exit C.

730
00:48:17,853 --> 00:48:21,175
As a player enters this level, they find themselves

731
00:48:21,255 --> 00:48:22,536
in this space over here.

732
00:48:23,396 --> 00:48:26,118
And stealthing past the enemies through the door on the right,

733
00:48:26,538 --> 00:48:29,560
they enter this new room that I added in the second iteration.

734
00:48:30,241 --> 00:48:31,982
Now, it's hard to see here, especially, I

735
00:48:32,022 --> 00:48:33,743
suppose, in this situation.

736
00:48:34,463 --> 00:48:35,844
But there is a hidden passage here

737
00:48:35,864 --> 00:48:40,287
that techies can unlock to reach a hidden underground passage.

738
00:48:41,148 --> 00:48:42,869
And finding that and going through that,

739
00:48:44,350 --> 00:48:48,211
puts you into this situation here, a unique little set piece,

740
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,311
which only those players would be able to find,

741
00:48:50,411 --> 00:48:54,052
that gives more information about the background of what this space could be.

742
00:48:57,613 --> 00:49:01,514
And now, let's take a look at the other PlayStyle exclusive path in comparison.

743
00:49:02,195 --> 00:49:04,575
So, path 1 to exit B.

744
00:49:06,419 --> 00:49:11,524
As those players enter the location, they find themselves in this area over here, where

745
00:49:11,544 --> 00:49:15,688
they actually have the option to look into the room that the other path just stealthed

746
00:49:15,748 --> 00:49:16,008
through.

747
00:49:16,989 --> 00:49:21,072
Moving through a door on the left, they find themselves in the big room with the landmark

748
00:49:21,112 --> 00:49:25,757
I mentioned earlier in, and successfully stealthing through this section on the left side.

749
00:49:26,713 --> 00:49:30,554
They find themselves in this room, where in the background,

750
00:49:30,614 --> 00:49:32,735
there's also a small little window that, again,

751
00:49:32,855 --> 00:49:35,436
looks back into the landmark room.

752
00:49:36,316 --> 00:49:38,836
And stealthing through this, you can make your way down

753
00:49:38,876 --> 00:49:41,617
to the lower floor, where you see this section.

754
00:49:43,297 --> 00:49:45,458
And as you can see, the paths provide

755
00:49:45,538 --> 00:49:47,058
completely different experiences,

756
00:49:47,298 --> 00:49:51,119
each giving their own little slice and impression

757
00:49:51,199 --> 00:49:52,920
on the player, what's going on here.

758
00:49:56,312 --> 00:49:58,154
All right, let's summarize.

759
00:49:58,934 --> 00:50:02,858
I equip you guys with three principles to enhance your nonlinear designs.

760
00:50:03,538 --> 00:50:06,581
Principle number one, distance builds choices,

761
00:50:07,182 --> 00:50:10,464
and you can enhance it by making sure to spread entrances and paths

762
00:50:10,624 --> 00:50:12,346
as far away from each other as possible.

763
00:50:13,687 --> 00:50:16,830
Principle number two, exclusivity heightens wonder,

764
00:50:17,490 --> 00:50:20,753
which you can enhance by limiting the player's vision on other paths

765
00:50:20,953 --> 00:50:23,876
and committing the player to their choice using one-way passages.

766
00:50:25,230 --> 00:50:28,372
Principle number three, fulfills desire,

767
00:50:29,193 --> 00:50:31,755
which you can enhance by reserving and providing

768
00:50:31,855 --> 00:50:34,037
cool content for players and by avoiding

769
00:50:34,117 --> 00:50:36,378
to shatter the illusion for paths leading

770
00:50:36,418 --> 00:50:38,980
to the same outcome by not having them bottleneck

771
00:50:39,040 --> 00:50:39,821
into the same room.

772
00:50:41,382 --> 00:50:44,084
All three of these principles are not restricted to,

773
00:50:44,365 --> 00:50:46,746
but particularly effective at enhancing

774
00:50:46,787 --> 00:50:49,589
the powers of two different level beats designed

775
00:50:49,629 --> 00:50:51,570
to maximize choice and reward.

776
00:50:52,211 --> 00:50:54,813
That is, discovery and exploration.

777
00:50:56,610 --> 00:50:59,052
As always in our design-related disciplines, however,

778
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:01,633
nothing is always 100% true.

779
00:51:02,134 --> 00:51:03,735
And all these concepts heavily depend

780
00:51:03,835 --> 00:51:05,356
on the context of your game.

781
00:51:06,377 --> 00:51:09,199
Hopefully, this is still useful food for thought for you.

782
00:51:10,180 --> 00:51:12,982
With my research done and principles tested,

783
00:51:13,422 --> 00:51:14,743
I see my quest as updated.

784
00:51:15,123 --> 00:51:18,546
And I'm happy to say that the XP I gained

785
00:51:18,946 --> 00:51:20,307
provided a worthy payoff.

786
00:51:21,128 --> 00:51:21,728
Great quest.

787
00:51:22,248 --> 00:51:22,909
Would play again.

788
00:51:25,211 --> 00:51:25,511
And now.

789
00:51:26,695 --> 00:51:28,857
You know about the benefits of missing out.

790
00:51:30,018 --> 00:51:32,100
I put a lot of heart and effort into bringing you this,

791
00:51:32,140 --> 00:51:33,921
and I hope you found this valuable and fun.

792
00:51:35,863 --> 00:51:38,185
From the bottom of my heart, I want to say thank you.

793
00:51:38,525 --> 00:51:38,946
Thank you.

794
00:51:39,286 --> 00:51:40,948
Thank you for joining me here today.

795
00:51:41,688 --> 00:51:43,210
Doing a thing like this isn't easy.

796
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:44,571
It's a lot of work, and you know,

797
00:51:44,611 --> 00:51:46,212
there's a lot of imposter syndrome going on

798
00:51:46,232 --> 00:51:46,953
when you try to do this.

799
00:51:49,635 --> 00:51:50,696
However, there's my contacts.

800
00:51:50,736 --> 00:51:52,017
Please feel free to reach out to me.

801
00:51:52,057 --> 00:51:55,959
Also a big shout out to Blake for getting me into this and coaching me.

802
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:57,080
Thank you so much.

803
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:57,780
You're awesome.

804
00:51:58,180 --> 00:52:01,242
And thank you to GDC and the Level Design Summit team for inviting me.

805
00:52:02,143 --> 00:52:06,645
I'll be over at the wrap-up area in a moment, ready to answer your questions.

806
00:52:06,945 --> 00:52:08,266
And yeah, see you there.

807
00:52:08,486 --> 00:52:08,787
Thank you.

808
00:52:20,124 --> 00:52:24,748
Also, if you enjoyed this talk, please go check out the ones that my amazing colleagues are about to give.

809
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:26,549
I'm sure you'll find them insightful as well.

810
00:52:26,569 --> 00:52:27,550
We're here all week, guys!
