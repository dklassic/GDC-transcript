00:00:04,075 --> 00:00:05,276
Hello, I'm Michelle Jewett-Silva.

2
00:00:05,276 --> 00:00:06,237
And I'm James.

3
00:00:06,237 --> 00:00:07,298
My mic's on my drink.

4
00:00:07,298 --> 00:00:08,399
You can stand on this, too.

5
00:00:08,399 --> 00:00:08,679
Oh, cool.

6
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:09,981
Yeah, we're Ska Studios.

7
00:00:09,981 --> 00:00:15,105
And we made a game called Salt and Sanctuary.

8
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:19,950
Thank you.

9
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:23,091
That broke some tension, that was good.

10
00:00:23,091 --> 00:00:23,311
Yay.

11
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:26,812
So really the best way, like,

12
00:00:26,812 --> 00:00:28,253
without just saying stuff like,

13
00:00:28,253 --> 00:00:30,453
it's an action RPG, blah blah, it's really cool,

14
00:00:30,453 --> 00:00:33,374
the best way to round it up is just saying,

15
00:00:33,374 --> 00:00:34,915
it's 2D Dark Souls.

16
00:00:34,915 --> 00:00:37,356
That's really like the best hook for like.

17
00:00:37,956 --> 00:00:41,578
drawing people in to make it, to like explore it better

18
00:00:41,578 --> 00:00:42,318
and really get into it.

19
00:00:42,318 --> 00:00:45,159
So we're, the whole studio is right here, wah!

20
00:00:45,159 --> 00:00:46,260
Two people.

21
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:47,320
Two cats, technically.

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:49,941
It took about two and a half years to develop

23
00:00:49,941 --> 00:00:52,482
and this is our fourth major huge game.

24
00:00:52,482 --> 00:00:52,622
Got it.

25
00:00:55,245 --> 00:00:57,186
So yeah, in terms of what to talk about,

26
00:00:57,186 --> 00:00:59,927
it's one of those scenarios where you spend so much time

27
00:00:59,927 --> 00:01:02,547
in the forest and can't see the forest from the trees

28
00:01:02,547 --> 00:01:03,208
kind of things.

29
00:01:03,208 --> 00:01:04,708
I had no idea what would be interesting,

30
00:01:04,708 --> 00:01:07,789
so I just said let's do the sexy thing that everyone does

31
00:01:07,789 --> 00:01:09,689
and crowdsource it and just ask Twitter.

32
00:01:09,689 --> 00:01:11,570
So that's what we did.

33
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:13,410
And we got a lot of questions.

34
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:17,171
So that's pretty much, it's like a preemptive Q&A.

35
00:01:17,171 --> 00:01:20,232
And that was, we kind of organized it a bit.

36
00:01:20,232 --> 00:01:22,353
But just starting right from the get go,

37
00:01:22,773 --> 00:01:25,395
People love to see concept art and sketches,

38
00:01:25,395 --> 00:01:28,537
and really, unfortunately, we don't really do that a lot.

39
00:01:28,537 --> 00:01:31,359
It's kind of sad because I love concept art,

40
00:01:31,359 --> 00:01:34,501
I love the books and all the really great visuals.

41
00:01:34,501 --> 00:01:38,623
Most of our stuff is just done directly into the computer

42
00:01:38,623 --> 00:01:41,185
and put right into the game.

43
00:01:41,185 --> 00:01:42,666
James does a little bit of stuff,

44
00:01:42,666 --> 00:01:45,588
basically when we're stuck in a metal box in the sky

45
00:01:45,588 --> 00:01:47,369
and have to be somewhere on a plane.

46
00:01:48,110 --> 00:01:50,831
And that's what happens there, that's his sketchbook.

47
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:52,192
Yeah, I got my sketchbook, I brought that.

48
00:01:52,192 --> 00:01:56,494
And then I do a little project that I call Monster of the Day, that every October I do

49
00:01:56,494 --> 00:01:58,075
a Monster of the Day, every day.

50
00:01:58,075 --> 00:02:04,378
And a lot of that gets drawn into the game's horrible creatures.

51
00:02:04,378 --> 00:02:09,500
So the map, the world map that doesn't actually exist in the game, it's much chagrin.

52
00:02:10,353 --> 00:02:15,826
It's kind of it's right there like a weird stain on it. I don't know if you can see that

53
00:02:15,826 --> 00:02:18,512
So I don't know what the nature of the stain is but that

54
00:02:19,638 --> 00:02:23,341
But I made that on a plane and kind of followed it like it was backed.

55
00:02:23,341 --> 00:02:28,964
And that's how it's like, so spoiler alert if you haven't played through the whole game,

56
00:02:28,964 --> 00:02:31,005
that's the actual world map of the game.

57
00:02:31,005 --> 00:02:35,908
And it's very hard to tell, I guess, but it matches up really well.

58
00:02:35,908 --> 00:02:37,409
It's pretty close, yeah.

59
00:02:37,409 --> 00:02:39,490
A little bit of alterings.

60
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:42,612
So here's some more, just to go through more concepts.

61
00:02:42,612 --> 00:02:45,593
There wasn't a lot of variation here.

62
00:02:45,593 --> 00:02:48,735
You can just see it went straight from sketch to creature.

63
00:02:49,747 --> 00:02:53,668
And this is some of my concepts of finish.

64
00:02:53,668 --> 00:02:56,368
As you can see, my style is super different from James's.

65
00:02:56,368 --> 00:02:57,328
That was my style.

66
00:02:57,328 --> 00:02:57,849
There's me.

67
00:02:57,849 --> 00:02:58,369
Look at that.

68
00:02:58,369 --> 00:02:59,849
And there's Michelle.

69
00:02:59,849 --> 00:03:00,609
She's really pretty.

70
00:03:00,609 --> 00:03:06,691
I'm very clean and concise and pretty, which doesn't really

71
00:03:06,691 --> 00:03:07,511
work for our game.

72
00:03:07,511 --> 00:03:11,072
But I have to work backwards and make it work with our

73
00:03:11,072 --> 00:03:12,752
sketchy, gritty style.

74
00:03:14,803 --> 00:03:16,925
and yeah, there's some more of mine.

75
00:03:16,925 --> 00:03:18,566
It's kind of a different style,

76
00:03:18,566 --> 00:03:22,089
but it's a bunch of armor set concepts.

77
00:03:23,463 --> 00:03:27,406
Right, the setting of the background is another, like,

78
00:03:27,406 --> 00:03:29,167
how did this happen?

79
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,028
Where did it come from?

80
00:03:30,028 --> 00:03:33,270
And we're just really in love with the song,

81
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:36,613
Waste and Fire, and really, especially with House Greyjoy,

82
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:39,695
and the themes behind that, where it's really nautical

83
00:03:39,695 --> 00:03:43,618
and, like, girty and sea salt soaking,

84
00:03:43,618 --> 00:03:46,760
and that's where we came up with the word salt, really,

85
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:50,983
is drawn from the ocean and the power of the ocean.

86
00:03:51,468 --> 00:03:55,269
Yeah, I'm kind of a geek for pre-modern science.

87
00:03:55,269 --> 00:03:58,491
Before the advent of the scientific method,

88
00:03:58,491 --> 00:04:00,131
it was like, how do we explain this?

89
00:04:00,131 --> 00:04:03,493
Well, it's probably a bit of fire and some gods,

90
00:04:03,493 --> 00:04:05,573
and that's where this came from.

91
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,894
It was figuring out things, including the supernatural

92
00:04:07,894 --> 00:04:08,495
as well as the natural.

93
00:04:08,495 --> 00:04:11,076
Yeah, so the creeds and their religious themes

94
00:04:11,076 --> 00:04:16,218
are just really to set the world and give it more flavor

95
00:04:16,218 --> 00:04:20,880
and really explore religion and culture.

96
00:04:22,576 --> 00:04:23,437
as a thing.

97
00:04:23,437 --> 00:04:28,701
Yeah, yeah, it was like the whole concept of modern atheism was non-existent in this

98
00:04:28,701 --> 00:04:29,101
kind of universe.

99
00:04:29,101 --> 00:04:32,964
And, because I have this like bugbear about Dungeons and Dragons where, you know, if someone

100
00:04:32,964 --> 00:04:35,206
wants to play like an atheist cleric and it's like...

101
00:04:35,206 --> 00:04:36,266
That doesn't make sense in this world.

102
00:04:36,266 --> 00:04:37,728
I mean, I'm sure you can make it work.

103
00:04:37,728 --> 00:04:40,209
A little bit of that coming through there.

104
00:04:40,209 --> 00:04:41,310
It's roleplay, but...

105
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:41,671
You know.

106
00:04:41,671 --> 00:04:41,931
Yeah.

107
00:04:41,931 --> 00:04:42,071
Yeah.

108
00:04:42,071 --> 00:04:42,391
Yeah.

109
00:04:42,391 --> 00:04:42,751
Yeah.

110
00:04:42,751 --> 00:04:42,972
Yeah.

111
00:04:42,972 --> 00:04:43,112
Yeah.

112
00:04:43,112 --> 00:04:43,752
Yeah.

113
00:04:43,752 --> 00:04:43,872
Yeah.

114
00:04:45,425 --> 00:04:46,646
But so that was that.

115
00:04:46,646 --> 00:04:53,094
Now we're going to get to something interesting, again, with our processes and methodology.

116
00:04:53,094 --> 00:04:55,437
We don't really have one, but we sort of do.

117
00:04:55,437 --> 00:04:56,698
So that was concept.

118
00:04:56,698 --> 00:05:00,463
And I like with the nuts and bolts, everyone's like, well, how do you, you know, what's...

119
00:05:00,703 --> 00:05:02,945
What's, like how do you start, what do you start with?

120
00:05:02,945 --> 00:05:05,147
And for me, it's always like, I just,

121
00:05:05,147 --> 00:05:07,589
it's like you have an imagined slice,

122
00:05:07,589 --> 00:05:09,811
and then you execute it.

123
00:05:09,811 --> 00:05:11,433
You know, it's just, it's content,

124
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,395
and then iteration becomes the execution.

125
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,097
For content, tools are a big deal,

126
00:05:16,097 --> 00:05:18,019
like I love talking about tools.

127
00:05:18,019 --> 00:05:19,740
And then, you know, iteration is where you just

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:21,462
keep working to make sure that your content

129
00:05:21,462 --> 00:05:22,883
matches that thing that you imagined.

130
00:05:22,883 --> 00:05:25,806
Like, for instance, with the dishwasher,

131
00:05:25,806 --> 00:05:27,007
which was kind of like the first.

132
00:05:27,407 --> 00:05:30,410
game that I made that was not horrible.

133
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:32,751
Like the scene I imagined was like,

134
00:05:32,751 --> 00:05:34,393
okay, what if it was like a Devil May Cry kind of thing

135
00:05:34,393 --> 00:05:35,934
and you could air combo someone

136
00:05:35,934 --> 00:05:37,595
and then like teleport up into the air

137
00:05:37,595 --> 00:05:40,017
and keep attacking them.

138
00:05:40,017 --> 00:05:40,698
How would that play out?

139
00:05:40,698 --> 00:05:41,999
How would that feel?

140
00:05:41,999 --> 00:05:43,800
And then so Charlie Murder was like,

141
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,221
I really like Punisher.

142
00:05:45,982 --> 00:05:49,463
Alien vs. Predator Arcade, what if that was punk rock?

143
00:05:49,463 --> 00:05:52,504
Salt and Sanctuary was like, what if we had a 2D fighter

144
00:05:52,504 --> 00:05:55,285
kind of game that took all these Dark Souls mechanics

145
00:05:55,285 --> 00:05:56,806
and how would that work?

146
00:05:56,806 --> 00:05:59,647
Could you have custom armor sets,

147
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:00,987
different move sets, different weapon sets,

148
00:06:00,987 --> 00:06:02,228
how would that all play out?

149
00:06:02,228 --> 00:06:03,888
So those were the kind of imagined,

150
00:06:03,888 --> 00:06:06,469
it's like a little slice where you're like,

151
00:06:06,469 --> 00:06:08,770
that'd be cool, I want to see that.

152
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:10,531
And then now you have this problem where you're like,

153
00:06:10,531 --> 00:06:12,451
I imagined a thing, I want to turn it into reality,

154
00:06:12,451 --> 00:06:12,852
what do I do?

155
00:06:12,852 --> 00:06:14,272
And then it's like, well I guess I have to,

156
00:06:15,013 --> 00:06:16,774
build all the tech.

157
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:19,136
So for Salt, that was the 2D animation system,

158
00:06:19,136 --> 00:06:23,699
the game world, loot system, probably more than that.

159
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:27,282
But that all requires tools and structures.

160
00:06:27,282 --> 00:06:30,445
Tools, just the better, it took me forever to realize this,

161
00:06:30,445 --> 00:06:31,705
but the better tools you make,

162
00:06:31,705 --> 00:06:33,227
the better content you can make.

163
00:06:33,227 --> 00:06:34,968
Because you're gonna spend so much time in the tools

164
00:06:34,968 --> 00:06:36,709
making the content, and games are mostly content.

165
00:06:36,709 --> 00:06:38,090
And then.

166
00:06:39,663 --> 00:06:43,306
create and iterate is really what we do a lot of.

167
00:06:43,306 --> 00:06:47,089
It's you make the thing, put the thing in the game,

168
00:06:47,089 --> 00:06:51,093
and then see how it looks, and iterate, iterate, iterate.

169
00:06:51,093 --> 00:06:51,753
That's how we do it.

170
00:06:51,753 --> 00:06:54,736
Yeah, and then, so this is like an aside question

171
00:06:54,736 --> 00:06:57,238
that's just, the answer is just gonna be no.

172
00:06:57,238 --> 00:06:59,440
But it's, you know, how much Porgumi junk did you plan out?

173
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,382
Do you use Agile, sprints, all these words

174
00:07:02,382 --> 00:07:05,645
that I just kind of vaguely can understand.

175
00:07:05,645 --> 00:07:07,246
But no, we don't, it's just, it's all self-taught.

176
00:07:08,218 --> 00:07:10,119
Yeah, so we do both have backgrounds.

177
00:07:10,119 --> 00:07:13,600
I have a BFA and James has a master's in computer science.

178
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,221
You wouldn't know it.

179
00:07:14,221 --> 00:07:14,781
You wouldn't know it.

180
00:07:14,781 --> 00:07:16,942
No, I'm just kidding.

181
00:07:16,942 --> 00:07:21,044
But in terms of the game aspect of it, that's all self-taught.

182
00:07:21,044 --> 00:07:22,845
So I learned how to use Photoshop

183
00:07:22,845 --> 00:07:25,126
and how to get things into the computer.

184
00:07:26,102 --> 00:07:32,026
And yeah, most of the challenges were just like adapting shaders to PS4, you know, but it was pretty doable.

185
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:38,850
Games mostly content, so maps and characters and animations, a lot of animations.

186
00:07:40,174 --> 00:07:41,474
A lot of time was spent on that.

187
00:07:41,474 --> 00:07:46,217
Yeah, so it all kind of comes down to identifying a type of content that needs to be in the game.

188
00:07:46,217 --> 00:07:51,220
And then, you know, you could sit down and hard-code it and more power to you,

189
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:57,883
but the way to really be able to be flexible with content and expressive and artistic is to make really good tools.

190
00:07:57,883 --> 00:08:01,265
And then those tools become kind of, you know, it's like a paintbrush.

191
00:08:01,265 --> 00:08:05,227
You know, you make a really good paintbrush and then you can make a better painting and so on.

192
00:08:06,408 --> 00:08:09,251
And an interesting thing is when you're making these tools,

193
00:08:09,251 --> 00:08:11,394
a lot of the game logic that goes into the actual game

194
00:08:11,394 --> 00:08:14,097
is just created through the creation of the tool.

195
00:08:14,097 --> 00:08:15,939
So what were those tools specifically?

196
00:08:15,939 --> 00:08:18,241
And then let's start with the regular ones.

197
00:08:18,241 --> 00:08:20,403
Visual Studio 2012, Photoshop,

198
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,566
GarageBand was for music, Audacity,

199
00:08:22,566 --> 00:08:24,748
and then I used, it's XNA is still the framework.

200
00:08:24,748 --> 00:08:27,110
I'm gonna keep carrying that torch as long as I can.

201
00:08:27,110 --> 00:08:27,451
Long live XNA.

202
00:08:29,933 --> 00:08:31,894
And then we used Monogame for PS4.

203
00:08:31,894 --> 00:08:37,157
But yeah, for the custom stuff that I'm getting into,

204
00:08:37,157 --> 00:08:40,218
it's tools that I started working on in 2007.

205
00:08:40,218 --> 00:08:45,461
A lot of them have like, most of the code is in common

206
00:08:45,461 --> 00:08:48,783
from what I made for Dishwasher Dead Samurai.

207
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:51,624
Like the character editor, I've carried that one forever.

208
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:56,047
but stuff like atlasing, animation, map, monster,

209
00:08:56,047 --> 00:08:58,249
loot definitions, the skill tree was a new one,

210
00:08:58,249 --> 00:09:00,691
destructibles was from Charlie Murder, dialogue editor,

211
00:09:00,691 --> 00:09:01,771
and then here they are.

212
00:09:01,771 --> 00:09:02,572
They are.

213
00:09:02,572 --> 00:09:04,113
This is our

214
00:09:06,028 --> 00:09:06,369
Atlas.

215
00:09:06,369 --> 00:09:07,029
Atlas editor.

216
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:07,449
Editor.

217
00:09:07,449 --> 00:09:07,609
Yeah.

218
00:09:07,609 --> 00:09:10,009
And so I was doing development streams.

219
00:09:10,009 --> 00:09:13,090
And people would be spending a lot of time

220
00:09:13,090 --> 00:09:15,711
in our tools, which kind of goes with my point.

221
00:09:15,711 --> 00:09:17,071
That's where I spent most of the time,

222
00:09:17,071 --> 00:09:20,452
was just in the tool that I made for the content.

223
00:09:20,452 --> 00:09:22,092
So I'd have a tool, and I'd be using it.

224
00:09:22,092 --> 00:09:25,173
And then the viewers would be like, what's that called?

225
00:09:25,173 --> 00:09:27,173
And I'd be like, well, it's the sheet editor.

226
00:09:27,173 --> 00:09:28,894
They'd be like, no, it needs a better name.

227
00:09:28,894 --> 00:09:30,094
So then we ended up calling this one.

228
00:09:30,094 --> 00:09:32,455
So we came up with kind of a crowd source names

229
00:09:32,455 --> 00:09:33,315
for all these things.

230
00:09:33,315 --> 00:09:35,615
So it's the cartographer.

231
00:09:36,236 --> 00:09:38,298
animation tool is Skellington's.

232
00:09:38,298 --> 00:09:41,121
Yeah, that's the one that's been like since

233
00:09:41,121 --> 00:09:43,984
Dishwasher Dead Samurai and it's been so improved.

234
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,726
So the tools also have been iterated

235
00:09:45,726 --> 00:09:47,247
and just worked on and worked on

236
00:09:47,247 --> 00:09:48,669
and they're so much better now.

237
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:54,390
It's basically assembling frames out of parts. It's all skeletal.

238
00:09:54,390 --> 00:09:56,472
There's parent-child hierarchy.

239
00:09:56,472 --> 00:09:59,694
Yeah, this is our first game that has had skeletons and hierarchy.

240
00:09:59,694 --> 00:10:03,577
Our previous games were just like drag the thing a little bit.

241
00:10:03,577 --> 00:10:05,959
It was parts floating in space.

242
00:10:05,959 --> 00:10:07,740
Yeah, it was challenging.

243
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:11,363
Yep. There's our map editor. We called that Salmon Maps.

244
00:10:11,363 --> 00:10:14,165
Yeah, so Salmon Maps was supposed to be like Sam and Max,

245
00:10:14,165 --> 00:10:16,586
but it's maps, so it's Salmon Maps, I guess.

246
00:10:16,586 --> 00:10:17,267
Delicious.

247
00:10:18,758 --> 00:10:26,079
It's a map editor and the whole world is one giant map, which we should have had a picture, but it's one big world.

248
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,680
I guess you saw the map in the beginning.

249
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:28,840
I got close to that, yeah.

250
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:29,700
Yeah, you got it.

251
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:35,061
Yeah, so our monster editor and our loot editor, they're kind of a similar thing.

252
00:10:35,061 --> 00:10:44,563
It's just a place to organize all the metadata, like, you know, the value of things, like how much damage does this do, that kind of thing.

253
00:10:45,098 --> 00:10:51,802
and then the smashables editor needs a name if anyone wants to help us with that. That one I

254
00:10:51,802 --> 00:10:56,144
created for Charlie murder. That's basically for representing how an object will destroy if it can

255
00:10:56,144 --> 00:11:00,286
be destroyed. So it would be like you create an object and create a bunch of sprites of the

256
00:11:00,286 --> 00:11:06,110
pieces that the object will destroy into and then painstakingly arrange them like a puzzle so

257
00:11:06,110 --> 00:11:08,691
that they all spawn in the right places.

258
00:11:10,069 --> 00:11:14,092
Dialogue editor, we have never had major dialogue before,

259
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:15,914
so this was a big thing.

260
00:11:15,914 --> 00:11:19,177
There's about 55,000 words in the game,

261
00:11:19,177 --> 00:11:20,818
so we needed a tool for that.

262
00:11:20,818 --> 00:11:22,019
That kind of got out of control.

263
00:11:23,657 --> 00:11:28,881
But yeah, for dialogue trees, you can have parts where they

264
00:11:28,881 --> 00:11:32,544
ask you a question, and you can select an option.

265
00:11:32,544 --> 00:11:36,487
Like an amount of limited logic, like you can have a

266
00:11:36,487 --> 00:11:39,730
flag be set after you answer something, and then they can

267
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:41,371
change their dialogue based on that flag.

268
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:44,493
It's pretty limited, but it's just enough functionality.

269
00:11:45,005 --> 00:11:48,749
Yeah, so the skill tree again, the skills thing was new.

270
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,851
We had a kind of very rudimentary version of this

271
00:11:50,851 --> 00:11:55,215
in Charlie Murder, but this is like major RPG.

272
00:11:55,215 --> 00:11:57,037
We needed a big skill tree.

273
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:59,321
And that's what came of it.

274
00:11:59,321 --> 00:12:01,443
And I was pretty proud of myself,

275
00:12:01,443 --> 00:12:03,284
because that was making an editor

276
00:12:03,284 --> 00:12:06,767
to make and edit one file only.

277
00:12:06,767 --> 00:12:08,989
But without the editor, it would have been a nightmare

278
00:12:08,989 --> 00:12:12,292
to place everything and do all the connections programmatically

279
00:12:12,292 --> 00:12:13,674
hard coding it.

280
00:12:13,674 --> 00:12:15,815
So just love editors.

281
00:12:15,815 --> 00:12:17,057
They're a good thing.

282
00:12:17,057 --> 00:12:19,859
All right, so Jason Z, he's an awesome dude

283
00:12:19,859 --> 00:12:21,621
who's been a longtime follower.

284
00:12:23,757 --> 00:12:29,684
you know, what was like the first thing that you made for this game and is there anything that didn't make it in?

285
00:12:29,684 --> 00:12:36,793
So we talked concept and then the tools, the foundation, and then the question is when do you go from foundation to content?

286
00:12:36,793 --> 00:12:39,136
You know, you build all this foundation.

287
00:12:39,136 --> 00:12:40,537
So yeah, the first enemy...

288
00:12:41,769 --> 00:12:42,510
I misspelled.

289
00:12:42,510 --> 00:12:47,113
That zombie guy, the berserker on the...

290
00:12:47,113 --> 00:12:47,814
It's an S.

291
00:12:47,814 --> 00:12:48,554
On the right there.

292
00:12:48,554 --> 00:12:49,775
B-R-S-E, I just...

293
00:12:49,775 --> 00:12:50,075
I guess so.

294
00:12:50,075 --> 00:12:53,418
Yeah, he was the first guy and also the first AI

295
00:12:53,418 --> 00:12:56,500
and a lot of monsters had that carried over

296
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:58,261
with a little bit of adaptation to them.

297
00:12:58,602 --> 00:13:02,964
Yeah, because of the AI, you make it for that, now you can use the AI for new monsters.

298
00:13:02,964 --> 00:13:08,688
And you can reuse parts of an AI to define behaviors,

299
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:11,489
and then the behaviors you can plug into different monsters.

300
00:13:11,489 --> 00:13:16,492
And so much of what feels like the behavior of a monster is defined through its animations,

301
00:13:16,492 --> 00:13:20,174
which comes from that tool.

302
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:26,078
It really, you start doing a few things and a lot of stuff comes of that, whether you like it or not.

303
00:13:29,062 --> 00:13:32,223
All right, so how do you know, once you have a concept,

304
00:13:32,223 --> 00:13:33,483
if it's worth pursuing?

305
00:13:33,483 --> 00:13:34,864
Because we always have ideas,

306
00:13:34,864 --> 00:13:36,885
and sometimes prototypes going on.

307
00:13:36,885 --> 00:13:39,545
How do you decide this is the thing you should be doing?

308
00:13:39,545 --> 00:13:42,807
And really, the biggest thing were our peers,

309
00:13:42,807 --> 00:13:45,307
people like friends who would check out early prototypes,

310
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:47,528
and just being super excited and saying,

311
00:13:47,528 --> 00:13:49,449
this is something you need to do.

312
00:13:49,449 --> 00:13:49,629
So.

313
00:13:50,588 --> 00:13:53,231
Yeah, Biggest Catalyst appears.

314
00:13:53,231 --> 00:13:56,573
And you can tell that this is fun to play.

315
00:13:56,573 --> 00:13:58,154
And it's exciting to work on.

316
00:13:58,154 --> 00:13:59,616
Like, you want to get up every day

317
00:13:59,616 --> 00:14:01,437
and immediately start working on it.

318
00:14:01,437 --> 00:14:03,379
It's definitely scary, though, like,

319
00:14:03,379 --> 00:14:04,460
going from prototype to, like,

320
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,161
this is the thing I'm gonna be working on

321
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,742
for two years of my life.

322
00:14:08,342 --> 00:14:13,684
On the technical level, because you don't know if the foundation is legal or not.

323
00:14:13,684 --> 00:14:18,506
And then on the greater existential level, like is this really going to be good?

324
00:14:18,506 --> 00:14:22,187
Is this really something we should try to make good if it's not good?

325
00:14:22,187 --> 00:14:26,868
And are people still going to like the Souls genre by the time we actually get this thing out?

326
00:14:26,868 --> 00:14:31,670
I feel like there must be people here who told us to go from prototype to invention.

327
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:34,671
Yeah, we've got some friends maybe here that were like, do this game.

328
00:14:34,671 --> 00:14:37,412
You guys can say something or just keep it to yourself.

329
00:14:37,612 --> 00:14:39,292
But I feel like there must be something,

330
00:14:39,292 --> 00:14:40,933
because we showed it around a bunch.

331
00:14:40,933 --> 00:14:42,333
So what does a typical day look like?

332
00:14:42,333 --> 00:14:45,255
What's it like working together with your spouse?

333
00:14:45,255 --> 00:14:46,695
I like to be sassy and say,

334
00:14:46,695 --> 00:14:48,416
it's a lot like working with your co-worker,

335
00:14:48,416 --> 00:14:51,617
except you're married.

336
00:14:51,617 --> 00:14:53,198
And a typical day is like,

337
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:56,059
it's really good to have some kind of routine,

338
00:14:56,059 --> 00:14:58,160
like get up or drinking coffee,

339
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,501
I'm answering some emails,

340
00:15:00,501 --> 00:15:02,261
and then dive right into

341
00:15:02,261 --> 00:15:03,822
whatever you're working on at the time.

342
00:15:04,974 --> 00:15:08,377
you know, music, audio, animation, art, the maps,

343
00:15:08,377 --> 00:15:10,179
lots and lots of animation.

344
00:15:11,639 --> 00:15:13,840
Like you like to do five minutes?

345
00:15:13,840 --> 00:15:16,981
Actually the five is probably too much, I was going to change it and I did it.

346
00:15:16,981 --> 00:15:20,362
I even said that when we rehearsed this too.

347
00:15:20,362 --> 00:15:26,705
But yeah, at least a day on a specific task, because if you do too much task switching,

348
00:15:26,705 --> 00:15:33,067
the mental overhead to just kind of gather your bearings and figure out what you're doing is too much.

349
00:15:33,067 --> 00:15:37,709
So if I was doing music, I would stick on music for two or three days at least.

350
00:15:38,029 --> 00:15:40,170
if it was audio, it was that, if it was coding,

351
00:15:40,170 --> 00:15:43,611
or working on the map, working on the new monster,

352
00:15:43,611 --> 00:15:45,952
it had to be like, just stick to this one task,

353
00:15:45,952 --> 00:15:47,933
and then the neat thing about that,

354
00:15:47,933 --> 00:15:50,254
switching tasks after that was exciting.

355
00:15:50,254 --> 00:15:53,695
Yeah, that makes the next thing fun.

356
00:15:53,695 --> 00:15:55,296
Yeah, those dev streams that we were doing

357
00:15:55,296 --> 00:15:58,197
really helped keep us on task and working on.

358
00:15:58,677 --> 00:16:01,398
things that we should be working on.

359
00:16:01,398 --> 00:16:02,359
You're sitting around all day,

360
00:16:02,359 --> 00:16:05,620
and part of that routine thing is getting exercise.

361
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:07,981
Like, just sitting in one place all day,

362
00:16:07,981 --> 00:16:11,062
as we know, is not great for you.

363
00:16:11,062 --> 00:16:11,842
As tempting as it is,

364
00:16:11,842 --> 00:16:14,123
because you really just want to keep working on that thing

365
00:16:14,123 --> 00:16:15,824
that's giving you trouble,

366
00:16:15,824 --> 00:16:17,605
and you're excited about it.

367
00:16:17,605 --> 00:16:19,306
But exercise has been really good

368
00:16:19,306 --> 00:16:21,246
for just clearing your head,

369
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,127
as well as idea generating.

370
00:16:23,127 --> 00:16:26,528
Like, showers are sometimes good for idea generating.

371
00:16:27,189 --> 00:16:30,234
our long runs, because we were marathon training last year.

372
00:16:32,225 --> 00:16:33,065
That helped a lot.

373
00:16:33,065 --> 00:16:34,826
And again, you'll hear this a thousand times,

374
00:16:34,826 --> 00:16:36,926
communication is key, really.

375
00:16:36,926 --> 00:16:40,708
You just have to be able to communicate with each other

376
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:43,329
and work out any troubles.

377
00:16:43,329 --> 00:16:45,570
And one of the troubles that we had was,

378
00:16:45,570 --> 00:16:48,591
before this game, we didn't have source control.

379
00:16:48,591 --> 00:16:52,012
As you can imagine, that is bad, super bad.

380
00:16:52,012 --> 00:16:52,813
It used to be just me.

381
00:16:52,813 --> 00:16:55,173
It used to be just James, so that's fair.

382
00:16:55,173 --> 00:16:58,055
But I came on, what, like five years ago or something?

383
00:16:58,981 --> 00:17:02,003
And this is the first game we had that had that source control,

384
00:17:02,003 --> 00:17:03,584
and that really helped.

385
00:17:03,584 --> 00:17:04,725
Just for combining content.

386
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,846
Right. Like I would make something and say,

387
00:17:06,846 --> 00:17:09,328
James, put it in, please, and then he'd say, sure, sure,

388
00:17:09,328 --> 00:17:11,349
but he's busy doing his thing,

389
00:17:11,349 --> 00:17:13,970
and it just sort of gets ignored for a long time.

390
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:15,391
And then angry wife.

391
00:17:15,391 --> 00:17:17,433
But we worked it out.

392
00:17:17,433 --> 00:17:20,214
With that source control, I can put it in the game myself,

393
00:17:20,214 --> 00:17:23,256
and I don't ever have to be mad.

394
00:17:23,256 --> 00:17:23,877
Yep.

395
00:17:23,877 --> 00:17:26,699
All right. This is a loaded question.

396
00:17:26,699 --> 00:17:28,079
Is Chris here?

397
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:28,119
No.

398
00:17:30,491 --> 00:17:37,094
Yeah, so this is kind of a cool question about how do we walk the line of being a Souls homage without being a knockoff.

399
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:39,155
It was something we obsessed about a bit.

400
00:17:39,155 --> 00:17:45,217
Because it's how you describe the game, but it's still very unique, it's still got its own identity,

401
00:17:45,217 --> 00:17:51,479
but at the same time it's like, if you're into Dark Souls, you'll love this game.

402
00:17:51,479 --> 00:17:55,901
If not, we're probably going to waste our time trying to convince you otherwise.

403
00:17:55,901 --> 00:17:56,781
And that's just reality.

404
00:17:57,642 --> 00:18:00,304
But yeah, it was all about inspiration and identity.

405
00:18:00,304 --> 00:18:02,406
And I started looking at it like

406
00:18:02,406 --> 00:18:05,549
you're just drawing from a landscape of concepts.

407
00:18:05,549 --> 00:18:07,791
And these are concepts that come from everywhere

408
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:09,312
and I've used them.

409
00:18:09,312 --> 00:18:12,935
This bullet point of abbreviations on the bottom

410
00:18:12,935 --> 00:18:15,437
is Ninja Gaiden plus Devil May Cry

411
00:18:15,437 --> 00:18:18,060
is what became The Dishwasher, which was my first.

412
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,561
game that didn't suck, like I was saying.

413
00:18:20,561 --> 00:18:22,002
And then the dishwasher in Dark Souls

414
00:18:22,002 --> 00:18:24,063
became Salt and Sanctuary.

415
00:18:24,063 --> 00:18:25,905
You know, obviously much more heavily influenced

416
00:18:25,905 --> 00:18:27,806
by Dark Souls, but so many concepts of dishwasher,

417
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:30,708
like that brawly combat was what it went into, into Salt.

418
00:18:30,708 --> 00:18:33,990
And then since this, we've been playing a lot of Neo,

419
00:18:33,990 --> 00:18:36,852
and that's just so affirming and awesome.

420
00:18:36,852 --> 00:18:39,273
I love that game, but it's also kind of neat to see

421
00:18:39,273 --> 00:18:42,856
how this landscape of concepts is making more content,

422
00:18:42,856 --> 00:18:45,497
and you know, it makes me feel good.

423
00:18:47,842 --> 00:18:49,803
So balancing, difficulty of the game,

424
00:18:49,803 --> 00:18:52,366
when we're wrong, well that will lead into the next thing,

425
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:53,947
but balancing the game, again,

426
00:18:53,947 --> 00:18:56,409
it just comes down to iteration.

427
00:18:56,409 --> 00:18:57,190
There's not a science to it.

428
00:18:57,190 --> 00:18:58,811
We are artists at heart,

429
00:18:58,811 --> 00:19:02,835
and we learn science to help us make the art.

430
00:19:02,835 --> 00:19:06,438
So it's really just a lot of iteration, multiple builds.

431
00:19:07,515 --> 00:19:19,898
Yeah, well there's so much emphasis on like different builds affect the play style. That's what I really liked about Dark Souls was how it's an action game but you can be like I want to try a mage build, a priest build, let's try pole arms, let's try heavy weapons.

432
00:19:19,898 --> 00:19:30,360
And I really wanted to have that feel work where it's like we're an action game, you know these boss fights are going to be just intense and testing and if you try them with all these different builds it'll feel good.

433
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:37,442
And like, yeah, that's just what Michelle said, the only way to do that was just to sit down and play the game over and over and over and over.

434
00:19:38,102 --> 00:19:42,145
So while a lot of people like it, I'm kind of sick of it.

435
00:19:42,145 --> 00:19:46,167
But yeah, and also the critical path was unfinished for most of the development time.

436
00:19:46,167 --> 00:19:50,150
So you get a little farther and then have to kind of start over again.

437
00:19:50,150 --> 00:19:53,472
So I'm particularly sick of the early parts of the game.

438
00:19:53,472 --> 00:19:58,395
And then also, an interesting thing with Dark Souls is so much of the fun, the excitement,

439
00:19:58,395 --> 00:20:00,597
comes from not knowing what's around every corner.

440
00:20:00,597 --> 00:20:03,298
And when you're the developer, you know what's around every corner.

441
00:20:03,438 --> 00:20:04,379
There's no excitement in discovery.

442
00:20:04,379 --> 00:20:05,781
There's no excitement in fear.

443
00:20:05,781 --> 00:20:08,103
So doing that, it's kind of difficult to,

444
00:20:08,103 --> 00:20:10,866
you eventually kind of convince yourself,

445
00:20:10,866 --> 00:20:12,387
this might not be good.

446
00:20:12,387 --> 00:20:14,169
Will it be good?

447
00:20:14,169 --> 00:20:15,350
And you end up with that.

448
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:17,452
It's hard to tell.

449
00:20:17,452 --> 00:20:18,473
So what went wrong?

450
00:20:19,341 --> 00:20:25,086
Yeah, okay, so what went wrong was, so Monogame, like I said, you know, we're going to carry that torch.

451
00:20:25,086 --> 00:20:27,868
But Monogame did have some trouble with PS4 at first.

452
00:20:27,868 --> 00:20:34,253
There were some stability issues, but like, we wouldn't have been able to put it on PS4 if not for Monogame.

453
00:20:34,253 --> 00:20:38,436
But we did get yelled at a lot for the stability things, and it hurt our feelings.

454
00:20:39,217 --> 00:20:40,157
That was no fun.

455
00:20:40,157 --> 00:20:41,058
And then localization.

456
00:20:41,058 --> 00:20:44,419
The biggest thing that went wrong was localization.

457
00:20:44,419 --> 00:20:47,501
We did a major faux pas and released the game

458
00:20:47,501 --> 00:20:51,103
with basically Google Translate of localization.

459
00:20:51,103 --> 00:20:51,783
Oops, don't do that.

460
00:20:51,783 --> 00:20:53,144
Yeah, a lot of, you know, it was kind of like,

461
00:20:53,144 --> 00:20:55,645
let's lay the groundwork to support localization.

462
00:20:55,645 --> 00:20:56,606
Oops, we need content.

463
00:20:56,606 --> 00:20:58,807
Okay, let's use auto-generated content.

464
00:20:58,807 --> 00:21:00,308
And then, oops, here's a deadline.

465
00:21:00,308 --> 00:21:01,549
Maybe everyone won't mind.

466
00:21:01,549 --> 00:21:02,789
Oops, they did.

467
00:21:02,789 --> 00:21:05,931
And so it's been, you know, we're still fixing.

468
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:07,874
Yeah, so we definitely learned.

469
00:21:07,874 --> 00:21:09,718
If you don't have the languages localized yet,

470
00:21:09,718 --> 00:21:13,645
just launch in your native language.

471
00:21:13,645 --> 00:21:14,467
Don't fake it.

472
00:21:14,467 --> 00:21:15,448
People will notice.

473
00:21:15,814 --> 00:21:20,216
So what did go correctly when you do localization right,

474
00:21:20,216 --> 00:21:22,257
we worked with a publishing company,

475
00:21:22,257 --> 00:21:24,798
or publishing partner, Kakehashi Games,

476
00:21:24,798 --> 00:21:26,419
with our Japanese launch,

477
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:30,120
and that was so smooth and successful and nice.

478
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:33,582
You can see, this is just Japan numbers on Steam,

479
00:21:33,582 --> 00:21:35,543
so you can see launch, a little bump,

480
00:21:35,543 --> 00:21:37,383
and then Japanese low, you can see like,

481
00:21:37,383 --> 00:21:39,144
oh yeah, when people can understand your game,

482
00:21:39,144 --> 00:21:40,485
they play it more, weird.

483
00:21:41,432 --> 00:21:42,412
We don't know what that spike is.

484
00:21:42,412 --> 00:21:45,353
We don't know what that last little giant spike is.

485
00:21:45,353 --> 00:21:47,694
We're guessing an influencer, like a streamer or something,

486
00:21:47,694 --> 00:21:48,274
picked it up.

487
00:21:48,274 --> 00:21:49,315
Like it didn't line up to anything.

488
00:21:49,315 --> 00:21:51,195
It didn't line up to anything, so I don't know.

489
00:21:51,195 --> 00:21:53,436
Sometimes you just don't know.

490
00:21:53,436 --> 00:21:54,617
I thought it was cool to put there, though,

491
00:21:54,617 --> 00:21:56,297
because it's like without the loke,

492
00:21:56,297 --> 00:21:58,578
without the original thing, maybe that spike never

493
00:21:58,578 --> 00:21:59,498
would have happened.

494
00:21:59,498 --> 00:22:01,559
So it's just a weird, you know.

495
00:22:01,559 --> 00:22:04,380
Yeah, so we're actually still gradually getting localization

496
00:22:04,380 --> 00:22:07,502
implemented in correctly, patching that in.

497
00:22:10,601 --> 00:22:14,103
And then here's a What Went Wrong theme.

498
00:22:14,103 --> 00:22:15,844
Well, what did you spend too much time on

499
00:22:15,844 --> 00:22:17,886
that in hindsight probably wasn't worth it?

500
00:22:17,886 --> 00:22:19,847
And this is something I kind of wonder about.

501
00:22:19,847 --> 00:22:22,328
A lot of things I felt weren't super fleshed out.

502
00:22:22,328 --> 00:22:25,090
Like I wanted there to be these really

503
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:28,231
different differentiated creeds with different.

504
00:22:28,632 --> 00:22:33,373
weapons and a lot of different magic and playing a different creed would have a really

505
00:22:33,373 --> 00:22:38,435
significantly different play through experience. I don't think I really got the picture I wanted

506
00:22:38,435 --> 00:22:44,517
to get. Same thing with doing sanctuary takeovers and working for leaders. They felt kind of

507
00:22:44,517 --> 00:22:51,720
filler. But then it's one of those things where I'm like, I don't mind filler. I don't know.

508
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:54,641
That's probably the most honest answer I could give about that.

509
00:22:55,665 --> 00:22:58,347
All right, so this is the most common question,

510
00:22:58,347 --> 00:23:01,270
and it's really interesting and strange,

511
00:23:01,270 --> 00:23:03,872
but how do you stay motivated and focused and committed?

512
00:23:03,872 --> 00:23:05,754
And it's interesting how many people,

513
00:23:05,754 --> 00:23:08,677
like how many people ask this question.

514
00:23:09,252 --> 00:23:10,252
telling really.

515
00:23:10,252 --> 00:23:12,773
So motivation, part of it is just being experienced.

516
00:23:12,773 --> 00:23:14,994
This is our fourth major game.

517
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:18,494
Seven, eight years now I think of development.

518
00:23:18,494 --> 00:23:20,815
It's a passion, but at the same time,

519
00:23:20,815 --> 00:23:23,295
our last game, Charlie Murder, super underperformed.

520
00:23:23,295 --> 00:23:23,716
It was scary.

521
00:23:23,716 --> 00:23:26,136
We had just closed on a house

522
00:23:26,136 --> 00:23:29,017
and we were moving from New York to Seattle.

523
00:23:29,017 --> 00:23:30,737
Very scary, very scary time.

524
00:23:30,737 --> 00:23:33,078
So part of that fear was a good motivator

525
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:36,558
to have a good game that would sell

526
00:23:36,558 --> 00:23:38,819
and so he wouldn't have to get real jobs.

527
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:44,426
But the thing is most Indie devs struggle, like a lot of Indie devs struggle with this,

528
00:23:44,426 --> 00:23:46,128
with motivation, self-doubt.

529
00:23:46,128 --> 00:23:50,634
It's a thing if you have that, you're absolutely not alone.

530
00:23:50,634 --> 00:23:52,476
It helps a lot.

531
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:53,938
For me, it's...

532
00:23:54,534 --> 00:23:56,416
Surrounding yourselves with other creatives,

533
00:23:56,416 --> 00:23:59,199
other developers, GDC, for example,

534
00:23:59,199 --> 00:24:01,202
PAX, it's really great to just listen

535
00:24:01,202 --> 00:24:03,384
and talk to other developers who are making things

536
00:24:03,384 --> 00:24:05,466
and making awesome stuff.

537
00:24:05,466 --> 00:24:06,327
It's really great.

538
00:24:06,327 --> 00:24:07,889
I always come back from these things

539
00:24:07,889 --> 00:24:10,332
like super recharged and wanting to make things.

540
00:24:11,292 --> 00:24:12,613
and play other games.

541
00:24:12,613 --> 00:24:16,396
So when all the new Souls games are coming out

542
00:24:16,396 --> 00:24:20,380
and Bloodborne and whatnot, we kind of took a break

543
00:24:20,380 --> 00:24:23,122
and just played the heck out of those games.

544
00:24:23,122 --> 00:24:25,244
As long as the game isn't a time vampire.

545
00:24:25,244 --> 00:24:25,524
Diablo.

546
00:24:27,434 --> 00:24:36,960
And then my quick tip is to switch it up because whenever I switch from one mode to another, or if I try to add a new feature or something,

547
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:42,984
it's funny because it's like going back to that thing how I said I added features that were kind of sucky, and now I'm saying,

548
00:24:42,984 --> 00:24:46,286
but if you lose your motivation, add a new feature.

549
00:24:46,286 --> 00:24:48,587
Switch it up. It's a little bit conflicting, but...

550
00:24:49,676 --> 00:24:50,196
It still works.

551
00:24:50,196 --> 00:24:52,217
So, I think this is our last question,

552
00:24:52,217 --> 00:24:53,437
multi-part question.

553
00:24:53,437 --> 00:24:53,837
Thanks, Annie.

554
00:24:53,837 --> 00:24:57,979
What was it like working with Sony versus Microsoft?

555
00:24:57,979 --> 00:24:59,960
We talked about the tools

556
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:02,481
and how those translated a little bit difficult.

557
00:25:02,481 --> 00:25:05,342
And Steam, PC is a new thing for us,

558
00:25:05,342 --> 00:25:08,043
which is strange because it's usually the other way around.

559
00:25:08,043 --> 00:25:10,344
Like, Indies do PC first and then console.

560
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,164
We're a little bit weird.

561
00:25:11,957 --> 00:25:13,820
Managing those multiple platforms.

562
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:15,883
We haven't done that before either.

563
00:25:15,883 --> 00:25:17,465
It's totally new.

564
00:25:17,465 --> 00:25:20,370
Okay, so we've got five minutes here.

565
00:25:20,370 --> 00:25:21,231
Yeah, and then marketing.

566
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:23,235
Like, what did we do for marketing?

567
00:25:23,235 --> 00:25:26,019
So, first of all, Sony Pub Fund.

568
00:25:26,874 --> 00:25:27,895
It's awesome.

569
00:25:27,895 --> 00:25:28,916
Yeah, it's awesome.

570
00:25:28,916 --> 00:25:33,740
I wish I could say more about it, but we're not supposed to.

571
00:25:33,740 --> 00:25:35,742
It's really awesome.

572
00:25:35,742 --> 00:25:38,944
We had so much uncertainty.

573
00:25:38,944 --> 00:25:42,467
Right, we came off of this generation switch from...

574
00:25:43,048 --> 00:25:45,549
Xbox 360 to the new console generation.

575
00:25:45,549 --> 00:25:51,033
XBLA didn't exist anymore and that was just soul crushing

576
00:25:51,033 --> 00:25:52,674
because that's what we lived on

577
00:25:52,674 --> 00:25:54,395
and that's how we made our living.

578
00:25:54,395 --> 00:25:56,377
So, like, what do we do, what do we do?

579
00:25:56,377 --> 00:25:58,878
And PS4 says, hi, we love indies.

580
00:25:58,878 --> 00:26:03,781
So, that was just a really, really nice

581
00:26:03,781 --> 00:26:05,603
incentive and motivation.

582
00:26:06,227 --> 00:26:09,667
Right, like having them backing us and then,

583
00:26:09,667 --> 00:26:11,408
it kind of took away all the fear of failure,

584
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:15,148
which really just, I mean, it was affecting.

585
00:26:15,148 --> 00:26:17,169
It gets to anyone.

586
00:26:17,169 --> 00:26:20,289
But yeah, there were a lot of big changes.

587
00:26:20,289 --> 00:26:23,130
We used to do first party publishing through Microsoft

588
00:26:23,130 --> 00:26:24,930
for like six years.

589
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:26,791
It was all just first party publishing through Microsoft,

590
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:29,291
and that was really the only thing I knew.

591
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:31,892
And then going from that to Sony's self-publishing,

592
00:26:31,892 --> 00:26:34,752
it was scary and it was new and different.

593
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:38,615
It's probably why I thought we were supposed to do localization, you know, even if...

594
00:26:38,615 --> 00:26:38,735
Yeah.

595
00:26:38,735 --> 00:26:40,536
Because that's what we do.

596
00:26:40,536 --> 00:26:41,537
Because Xbox had done...

597
00:26:41,537 --> 00:26:41,717
Yeah.

598
00:26:41,717 --> 00:26:47,401
...did the localization in QA and everything for us and it was new to us, that whole brand new world.

599
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:52,204
And Steam as a new platform, oh yeah, that's a thing, that's a really big thing actually.

600
00:26:52,204 --> 00:26:56,527
And after seven years of console exclusivity, this is... Steam's so cool.

601
00:26:57,648 --> 00:26:59,310
You can see all your data on there.

602
00:26:59,310 --> 00:27:01,733
It's really easy to push an update.

603
00:27:01,733 --> 00:27:03,235
The only thing is it's a little bit tricky

604
00:27:03,235 --> 00:27:05,198
now that we have to actually think about

605
00:27:05,198 --> 00:27:06,520
all these different platforms.

606
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,604
It's a little tricky, but you set reminders

607
00:27:09,604 --> 00:27:10,926
and remind yourself to do it.

608
00:27:11,642 --> 00:27:15,643
Yeah, it's because it's Sony America, Sony Europe, Steam,

609
00:27:15,643 --> 00:27:16,784
and then Vita.

610
00:27:16,784 --> 00:27:18,244
Vita is coming out.

611
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,265
It's coming.

612
00:27:20,265 --> 00:27:21,866
We're really bad at self-promotion.

613
00:27:21,866 --> 00:27:26,067
I hate to say that, but we think about it last minute so much

614
00:27:26,067 --> 00:27:28,548
because we're so focused on getting the game done

615
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:30,449
and focused on the development of it.

616
00:27:30,449 --> 00:27:32,950
Luckily, we are super lucky with this.

617
00:27:32,950 --> 00:27:36,111
There's this huge community of streamers and YouTubers

618
00:27:36,111 --> 00:27:37,772
that are into these kind of games.

619
00:27:38,252 --> 00:27:39,854
And they found us.

620
00:27:39,854 --> 00:27:41,916
It all started with Bhatibidya,

621
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:45,741
and he really sparked that powder keg.

622
00:27:45,741 --> 00:27:47,803
It was amazing.

623
00:27:47,803 --> 00:27:49,665
Sony, again, also was super awesome.

624
00:27:49,665 --> 00:27:51,006
We got on the launch party promotion,

625
00:27:51,006 --> 00:27:52,868
and that helped a good deal.

626
00:27:53,984 --> 00:27:57,826
Yeah, and their PR was great.

627
00:27:57,826 --> 00:27:59,327
So, post-mortem is post-mortem.

628
00:27:59,327 --> 00:28:02,369
Cherish motivation when you have it, seek it.

629
00:28:02,369 --> 00:28:03,729
Surround yourself with your peers

630
00:28:03,729 --> 00:28:05,410
and listen to their advice.

631
00:28:05,410 --> 00:28:07,791
So many times we just are left wondering,

632
00:28:07,791 --> 00:28:09,812
what do we do, I'm so lost.

633
00:28:09,812 --> 00:28:13,134
Go talk to your developer friends, make developer friends.

634
00:28:13,134 --> 00:28:18,137
Ask them advice and listen to it or not, but talk to people.

635
00:28:18,137 --> 00:28:20,438
Don't release unfinished loke.

636
00:28:20,438 --> 00:28:21,138
Don't, it's bad.

637
00:28:21,515 --> 00:28:22,095
That was a big takeaway.

638
00:28:22,095 --> 00:28:25,057
It was such a big takeaway that shocked us

639
00:28:25,057 --> 00:28:26,899
because we weren't used to it.

640
00:28:26,899 --> 00:28:31,562
And also, just huge, huge thanks to all those

641
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:35,886
content creators that really helped spread word of mouth.

642
00:28:35,886 --> 00:28:40,029
Fans, gamers, Sony of course, and our friends and family.

643
00:28:41,214 --> 00:28:44,595
I feel like without Sony just really having a lot of faith

644
00:28:44,595 --> 00:28:46,696
in this project, it wouldn't have, you know,

645
00:28:46,696 --> 00:28:50,138
I mean, it really like pushed it and catalyzed it.

646
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:51,338
It really helped a lot, so.

647
00:28:51,338 --> 00:28:52,079
Yeah, that was awesome.

648
00:28:52,079 --> 00:28:53,359
Thank you for listening to our talk,

649
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:56,020
and I don't know if we have any time for questions,

650
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,401
but we're gonna head over to the wrap-up room

651
00:28:58,401 --> 00:28:59,642
on the other side.

652
00:28:59,642 --> 00:29:02,643
Do we have time for a question?

653
00:29:02,643 --> 00:29:03,984
It says 419.

654
00:29:03,984 --> 00:29:05,204
I guess, no.

655
00:29:05,204 --> 00:29:06,445
I think we're good.

656
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,765
I think we're good, yeah, thank you.
