1
00:00:03,171 --> 00:00:08,537
Good morning everybody. Thanks for coming. Uh, welcome to Building Esports. Uh, my name is Nick

2
00:00:08,557 --> 00:00:13,462
Allen. I work at Twitch. Uh, I'm also joined by Chris from Daybreak, the executive producer on

3
00:00:13,602 --> 00:00:19,708
H1Z1. Uh, so we're going to be talking overall for about an hour. Um, I'll be talking about 20

4
00:00:20,108 --> 00:00:23,772
minutes or so, then open it up to the, for you guys for questions. Um,

5
00:00:24,512 --> 00:00:28,194
But really the takeaway, at least from my presentation, is hopefully you walk out of

6
00:00:28,254 --> 00:00:33,897
here with sort of a holy shit moment of, hey, there's a lot that goes into eSports as a

7
00:00:33,997 --> 00:00:34,277
whole.

8
00:00:34,337 --> 00:00:39,360
And I think what you see for the most part in eSports are these top level leagues on

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,081
Twitch or on some other platform.

10
00:00:42,862 --> 00:00:46,864
But underneath these top level leagues are a bunch of moving parts.

11
00:00:47,425 --> 00:00:53,529
And my hope is I can just highlight this again just so you guys have an idea of like what goes into building eSports.

12
00:00:53,569 --> 00:00:56,030
And today I'm going to be doing that through the lens of Rocket League.

13
00:00:56,931 --> 00:01:05,856
So Twitch, probably about a year ago now, entered into a partnership with Psyonix to help build Rocket League eSports.

14
00:01:06,637 --> 00:01:10,860
Rocket League was a title that came out of nowhere, surprised a lot of people, and has a lot of potential.

15
00:01:11,320 --> 00:01:15,963
I'll be talking a little bit about that and about our partnership and again all these

16
00:01:16,023 --> 00:01:16,624
moving parts.

17
00:01:17,204 --> 00:01:18,665
And again this is a picture.

18
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:19,486
I used to work at Riot.

19
00:01:19,866 --> 00:01:20,846
I pulled this off Twitter.

20
00:01:20,887 --> 00:01:22,167
Someone put devil horns on me.

21
00:01:22,768 --> 00:01:24,089
I thought it would be a good icebreaker.

22
00:01:24,849 --> 00:01:26,691
So one caveat really quick.

23
00:01:27,591 --> 00:01:31,274
Chris and I were talking about who wanted to go first and I wanted to go first because

24
00:01:31,314 --> 00:01:37,118
my slides are really terrible and I figured his slides are probably really good because

25
00:01:37,358 --> 00:01:38,359
I've played Daybreak games.

26
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:38,579
So.

27
00:01:40,104 --> 00:01:43,307
So let's talk about the agenda really quick. So I have a friendly reminder for you guys.

28
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:49,855
Um, and I'm going to talk about identifying eSports potential. Twitch, um, has an eSports

29
00:01:49,895 --> 00:01:51,837
department. And the eSports department itself...

30
00:01:52,636 --> 00:01:58,080
It focuses on building partnerships with game companies around eSports, ultimately to help

31
00:01:58,100 --> 00:02:01,883
them make better decisions around their titles in the eSports space.

32
00:02:02,724 --> 00:02:07,248
And our department was born out of a lot of different entities, a lot of different game

33
00:02:07,288 --> 00:02:09,890
companies coming to Twitch and asking, like, how do I do this thing?

34
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:10,851
How do I do it right?

35
00:02:11,591 --> 00:02:15,054
And seeing a bunch of other titles just not being successful in the space.

36
00:02:15,734 --> 00:02:17,316
We call that the eSports graveyard.

37
00:02:17,356 --> 00:02:21,399
But essentially, that is people coming in and throwing a bunch of money.

38
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:26,823
And you see these titles just dip and disappear.

39
00:02:26,843 --> 00:02:27,864
You never hear from them again.

40
00:02:28,504 --> 00:02:31,266
I won't call them out by name, but you probably have some in mind of like something that blew

41
00:02:31,346 --> 00:02:32,607
up and then instantly disappeared.

42
00:02:33,428 --> 00:02:39,852
Twitch, we want longevity and sustainability in the eSport space quite selfishly, honestly,

43
00:02:39,892 --> 00:02:44,255
because we think that if eSports are successful, they're going to be on Twitch and more people

44
00:02:44,275 --> 00:02:44,796
are going to watch it.

45
00:02:44,916 --> 00:02:47,778
And that's good for us, but it's just good for the space in general.

46
00:02:48,218 --> 00:02:51,260
And we just want to grow the thing to be as big as we can.

47
00:02:51,994 --> 00:02:55,576
So I'll be talking about eSports potential and how at Twitch we identify that.

48
00:02:56,337 --> 00:02:57,618
I'll talk about the goal.

49
00:02:58,018 --> 00:03:02,901
We generally have one big goal as we think about eSports at Twitch, when we think about

50
00:03:02,921 --> 00:03:03,682
these partnerships.

51
00:03:04,402 --> 00:03:06,303
And then we'll be talking about growing the ecosystem.

52
00:03:06,564 --> 00:03:09,686
And again, I want you guys to look at all the moving parts and think about sort of the

53
00:03:09,726 --> 00:03:13,888
complexity that comes in building a sustainable, successful eSport.

54
00:03:14,929 --> 00:03:16,050
But first a friendly reminder.

55
00:03:17,419 --> 00:03:21,902
Um, on the spelling of eSports. So you don't capitalize the M in email.

56
00:03:22,923 --> 00:03:27,065
Uh, so why the hell would you capitalize the S in eSports? It looks weird when you put it

57
00:03:27,085 --> 00:03:31,488
in front of a sentence and you have two capital letters in a row. Uh, it sort of undermines

58
00:03:31,548 --> 00:03:36,031
the brand a little bit. So please, uh, advocate for the correct spelling. Thank you very much.

59
00:03:36,871 --> 00:03:43,596
Um, if you walk away with one thing from this presentation, the friendly reminder of how

60
00:03:43,616 --> 00:03:44,957
to spell eSports correctly. Okay.

61
00:03:47,153 --> 00:03:52,880
So talking about identifying potential. So we talked to a lot of different game companies and

62
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:58,006
they come to us and they're like, hey, I want to do e-sports. And they don't have a clear

63
00:03:58,046 --> 00:04:03,792
understanding of what that is or why it's cool or what it's about or anything.

64
00:04:04,573 --> 00:04:09,575
And so we come in and we assess the game, and we try to give recommendations on what

65
00:04:09,595 --> 00:04:13,036
they should do, how they can improve, what they should be thinking about.

66
00:04:14,317 --> 00:04:19,539
And the amount that we sort of invest and sort of partner with them depends on do we

67
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:22,580
think that the game has a lot of potential in the eSports space.

68
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:27,502
And so the way that we evaluate that is does the game have a high skill ceiling?

69
00:04:28,618 --> 00:04:34,863
And does it have some features that allow for a competitive culture around the game?

70
00:04:35,604 --> 00:04:39,147
So private matchmaking, you'd be surprised a lot of game companies come to us and like

71
00:04:39,167 --> 00:04:43,671
hey we want to do an eSports, well you have no way for one person or one team to play

72
00:04:43,711 --> 00:04:45,713
against another team sort of like on demand.

73
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:49,696
So that's the first thing you're going to need in order to be able to create a competitive

74
00:04:49,756 --> 00:04:50,757
culture around your game.

75
00:04:52,279 --> 00:04:53,580
And it goes for things like

76
00:04:53,947 --> 00:04:59,149
So private matchmaking, custom game rules, can the community decide what's competitive

77
00:05:00,209 --> 00:05:03,531
and what's the highest level of competition around the game?

78
00:05:03,551 --> 00:05:07,792
And then the leaderboards are also a really important piece that we look at.

79
00:05:07,812 --> 00:05:11,994
Is there this aspirational path to being the best player in the world?

80
00:05:12,374 --> 00:05:14,895
Again, it goes back to this idea, is there a competitive culture?

81
00:05:15,876 --> 00:05:18,297
Rocket League does these things extremely well.

82
00:05:18,817 --> 00:05:23,419
There is a huge competitive community that aspires to be the best in the world.

83
00:05:24,696 --> 00:05:25,877
Also identifying potential.

84
00:05:26,197 --> 00:05:30,180
So we look at is there an existing and growing grassroots community.

85
00:05:30,200 --> 00:05:35,084
So these are examples of grassroots competitions and organizations

86
00:05:35,124 --> 00:05:38,646
that existed before Psyonix and Twitch partnered for Rocket League.

87
00:05:39,067 --> 00:05:41,909
Things like Rocket Royale, Rocket League Central,

88
00:05:42,229 --> 00:05:45,211
this is Geek Core running this Rocket League tournament as well.

89
00:05:45,491 --> 00:05:48,934
What these indicate is that people want to compete.

90
00:05:49,553 --> 00:05:54,384
and people want to organize tournaments. Those are two brutally important pieces of a

91
00:05:54,444 --> 00:05:59,596
holistic e-sports ecosystem. We forget we think much about uh the production company

92
00:06:00,032 --> 00:06:04,576
The developer and the game company, maybe the broadcasting platform, but you forget

93
00:06:04,596 --> 00:06:09,320
about the tournament organizers oftentimes and the aspirational path to being a tournament

94
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,322
organizer, content creators.

95
00:06:12,303 --> 00:06:17,447
There are a bunch of small players that are important in the growth of this holistic ecosystem.

96
00:06:17,907 --> 00:06:22,491
And this indicates that something is happening, that there could be more.

97
00:06:22,872 --> 00:06:26,154
And so this is one of the big things that we look for when we think about identifying

98
00:06:26,214 --> 00:06:28,556
potential in an eSports title.

99
00:06:30,317 --> 00:06:34,044
And then lastly and almost most importantly is,

100
00:06:34,545 --> 00:06:37,391
does the game company have an appetite to invest?

101
00:06:37,491 --> 00:06:39,135
And there's two ways that they can do this.

102
00:06:39,455 --> 00:06:39,616
One is.

103
00:06:40,974 --> 00:06:46,738
Cash money. Are they willing to put up prize money that is aspirational and interesting to players?

104
00:06:47,179 --> 00:06:56,906
Are they willing to support and create sustainability? Are they willing to take potentially some of their revenue that they're making on in-game items and pass that down to the players and the teams?

105
00:06:57,546 --> 00:07:08,194
Are they willing to do that? And oftentimes, we talk to game companies, they don't realize how much money they need to invest to be able to get this thing off the ground and be sustainable long-term.

106
00:07:09,415 --> 00:07:11,495
And oftentimes we're like, hey, well, you should do this event,

107
00:07:12,235 --> 00:07:13,996
and you should do this other event, and you should do all these other things.

108
00:07:14,036 --> 00:07:18,417
Like, well, we have a marketing budget for one small event in this one city,

109
00:07:18,437 --> 00:07:19,797
and that's all we can do the whole year.

110
00:07:21,097 --> 00:07:22,837
That isn't a sustainable long-term plan.

111
00:07:23,278 --> 00:07:24,418
And so this is a really big part.

112
00:07:24,438 --> 00:07:28,639
And the second thing is, and it's very closely related, bandwidth.

113
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,059
Engineering resources.

114
00:07:30,179 --> 00:07:33,840
Are you willing, as an entity, as a company, to invest in

115
00:07:34,546 --> 00:07:40,751
creating cool, compelling things in the game that support your eSports efforts.

116
00:07:42,352 --> 00:07:45,295
And this can also feed into this sort of revenue aspect too.

117
00:07:45,455 --> 00:07:50,419
But it's oftentimes, companies aren't willing to change their road map

118
00:07:51,139 --> 00:07:54,702
to accommodate this eSports ecosystem that is super important to

119
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,424
the competitive culture around their game.

120
00:07:57,084 --> 00:07:59,906
And so one of the first things that we ask when we talk to a game company is,

121
00:08:00,632 --> 00:08:02,593
You know, how big are you willing to go?

122
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:05,135
If this thing gets enormous, are you willing to support it?

123
00:08:06,356 --> 00:08:08,118
And what are your engineering resources,

124
00:08:08,158 --> 00:08:10,800
your internal resources, that you're

125
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:13,682
willing to utilize to support the things that you're doing?

126
00:08:15,924 --> 00:08:18,186
So again, very, very important things that we think about when

127
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:21,729
we identify potential opportunities in e-sports.

128
00:08:21,789 --> 00:08:24,591
So bringing this back to Rocket League and Psyonix,

129
00:08:24,631 --> 00:08:26,452
Psyonix is an amazing partner to Twitch

130
00:08:26,653 --> 00:08:28,574
around the Rocket League Championship

131
00:08:28,594 --> 00:08:29,635
Series and around e-sports.

132
00:08:30,195 --> 00:08:34,238
And it was clear very early, though they were a small studio, they were willing to invest

133
00:08:34,698 --> 00:08:38,900
whatever they needed to do to help this thing be successful, to help it be sustainable.

134
00:08:39,661 --> 00:08:43,543
And that showed us that we could do something with them long-term, it would be interesting,

135
00:08:44,063 --> 00:08:45,404
and we think it would be successful.

136
00:08:45,604 --> 00:08:47,945
And we're going to talk a little bit about all the different things that we've done.

137
00:08:49,046 --> 00:08:50,947
So that's identifying potential in what we've done.

138
00:08:52,967 --> 00:08:58,649
And talking about the goal, going back to this idea of the eSports graveyard, people

139
00:08:58,769 --> 00:09:02,390
generally have a top-down approach, game companies generally have a top-down approach when they

140
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:03,410
think about eSports.

141
00:09:03,870 --> 00:09:06,751
I know Chris will have some things to say about this and some really good things too.

142
00:09:08,191 --> 00:09:12,792
Thinking about, let's create a top-level event for the best players in the world, we'll throw

143
00:09:12,812 --> 00:09:13,953
a bunch of money at it, and then that's it.

144
00:09:14,678 --> 00:09:19,565
And then you have an entire player base that wants more, that desires more around the game

145
00:09:19,945 --> 00:09:22,069
that you're forgetting about, that you aren't supporting.

146
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:28,017
So it's important to have a really holistic view of supporting the eSport.

147
00:09:28,718 --> 00:09:30,881
And so talking about Rocket League and the way that we've done that.

148
00:09:32,854 --> 00:09:35,677
So we have the top level league, which is the Rocket League Championship Series.

149
00:09:35,817 --> 00:09:40,523
We're on our season three right now and we've had a lot of success.

150
00:09:40,563 --> 00:09:43,386
I could do an entire presentation on just a top level league.

151
00:09:43,906 --> 00:09:48,692
But to give you an idea of what goes into this, we have one person at Twitch fully dedicated

152
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:49,673
to the scheduling.

153
00:09:50,654 --> 00:09:52,575
of the league and also the rules.

154
00:09:52,695 --> 00:09:54,256
That's all that this person does.

155
00:09:54,276 --> 00:09:57,919
He has a full-time job supporting our rule set,

156
00:09:57,939 --> 00:10:00,140
supporting our schedule, working with teams

157
00:10:00,180 --> 00:10:02,001
and players to resolve conflict.

158
00:10:02,962 --> 00:10:04,643
And that is just one small aspect

159
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,064
of a giant massive league.

160
00:10:06,084 --> 00:10:07,625
So when you think about even a bigger league

161
00:10:07,645 --> 00:10:09,306
like the League of Legends Championship Series

162
00:10:09,947 --> 00:10:11,948
that has a staff of like 120 people

163
00:10:11,988 --> 00:10:13,089
to support that initiative.

164
00:10:13,850 --> 00:10:17,412
You start to understand how big these things can be

165
00:10:17,432 --> 00:10:18,313
and how many moving parts.

166
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:21,575
We're talking about production, stage design, hospitality,

167
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,877
all these different moving pieces

168
00:10:24,117 --> 00:10:25,719
and all the teams that you need to have

169
00:10:25,759 --> 00:10:26,920
to support these things.

170
00:10:28,941 --> 00:10:31,463
We're also investing heavily in caster development.

171
00:10:31,743 --> 00:10:34,726
These are the storytellers of the eSport.

172
00:10:35,146 --> 00:10:37,147
They are the faces of the game in many ways

173
00:10:37,207 --> 00:10:38,108
and of the eSport too.

174
00:10:38,969 --> 00:10:40,470
So these are all the casters for,

175
00:10:40,570 --> 00:10:42,592
this is season one, the broadcast talent.

176
00:10:42,995 --> 00:10:47,840
All of these people were handpicked out of the community to come in and then were mentored

177
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:50,903
and cultivated to be the professionals that you see today.

178
00:10:52,064 --> 00:10:54,386
And many times, this is what people think about.

179
00:10:54,447 --> 00:10:57,369
These guys are the people that they think about when they think about Rocket League.

180
00:10:57,850 --> 00:11:03,495
And they need to be able to represent the league, themselves, players, the brand, everything

181
00:11:03,615 --> 00:11:04,536
extremely well.

182
00:11:05,778 --> 00:11:12,104
If you have an amazing league but your casters are not talented or toxic or a bunch of different

183
00:11:12,144 --> 00:11:14,026
things, you can undermine the entire thing.

184
00:11:14,346 --> 00:11:17,149
So this is just one foundational piece that you have to develop.

185
00:11:17,449 --> 00:11:23,516
And we have at Twitch and at Psyonix, we have people fully dedicated to growing the professionalism

186
00:11:23,556 --> 00:11:26,879
and talent of the Rocket League Championship Series and of Rocket League.

187
00:11:29,797 --> 00:11:33,901
path to pro. So this is a really, really important aspect that a lot of people don't think about.

188
00:11:34,762 --> 00:11:38,445
When you think about football, professional football, and you think about what it takes

189
00:11:38,485 --> 00:11:43,389
to be a professional and how you get there, there's a clear path for you. You play in

190
00:11:43,449 --> 00:11:46,752
peewee football, and then you play in middle school, then high school, then college, and

191
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,273
then you're a pro.

192
00:11:48,794 --> 00:11:51,878
For many eSports, you say, how do I get in this top level competition?

193
00:11:51,918 --> 00:11:52,719
People have no idea.

194
00:11:52,999 --> 00:11:56,903
There's no clear aspirational path for people to look at and say,

195
00:11:58,225 --> 00:11:59,066
how do I get there?

196
00:11:59,166 --> 00:11:59,947
I have no idea.

197
00:11:59,967 --> 00:12:02,910
And so they just stop trying.

198
00:12:03,711 --> 00:12:05,233
Path to pro is an extremely important.

199
00:12:05,924 --> 00:12:11,549
And with the Rocket League Championship Series, we utilize an open qualifier every season

200
00:12:11,629 --> 00:12:14,171
to qualify in the next round of teams.

201
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:20,377
Our first or second season had over 6,000 teams sign up for the Rocket League Championship

202
00:12:20,417 --> 00:12:20,917
qualifier.

203
00:12:20,937 --> 00:12:25,621
And if you think about it, there's three to four players on every team, so you're talking

204
00:12:25,661 --> 00:12:27,923
roughly about 20,000 Rocket League players.

205
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:30,792
that you have to manage over the course of one to two weeks.

206
00:12:31,733 --> 00:12:35,916
And we have a full staff of Psyonix and Twitch employees,

207
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:37,878
six, seven, eight people in a war room

208
00:12:38,238 --> 00:12:41,840
over the course of a weekend running this tournament

209
00:12:42,101 --> 00:12:44,783
and all the moving parts with 20,000 players.

210
00:12:45,603 --> 00:12:47,485
And as the amount of people,

211
00:12:48,285 --> 00:12:50,167
as the prestige rises for the RLCS

212
00:12:50,567 --> 00:12:52,188
and more people start playing Rocket League,

213
00:12:52,749 --> 00:12:54,730
the more people are gonna be entering this thing,

214
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,891
the more challenging it becomes.

215
00:12:56,632 --> 00:12:58,515
But with that in mind, it's an important piece.

216
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:02,781
Again, the aspirational path of growing and becoming a professional is really, really

217
00:13:02,821 --> 00:13:03,161
important.

218
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:10,464
Narrative development, the storylines are an interesting piece, are an important piece

219
00:13:11,224 --> 00:13:12,985
of e-sports and something often overlooked.

220
00:13:13,986 --> 00:13:15,907
Why do you care as a viewer?

221
00:13:16,727 --> 00:13:18,788
Why do you care about these players and these teams?

222
00:13:19,949 --> 00:13:25,292
E-sports doesn't have the regional alliances or the regional rivalries that we see in traditional

223
00:13:25,352 --> 00:13:29,474
sports, so you need something else, something to care about and be passionate about.

224
00:13:30,795 --> 00:13:34,978
And these types of stories help build that narrative,

225
00:13:35,018 --> 00:13:39,101
help build up the celebrity and fame of these players

226
00:13:39,182 --> 00:13:40,843
and make it interesting for the fan to be like,

227
00:13:40,863 --> 00:13:43,084
hey, this is why I follow Karnovy,

228
00:13:43,124 --> 00:13:44,806
the best player in the world in Rocket League.

229
00:13:45,346 --> 00:13:48,829
And again, just very, very important stuff

230
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:50,830
as you think about why should you watch esports

231
00:13:50,890 --> 00:13:51,631
and why should you care.

232
00:13:52,937 --> 00:14:00,887
So for these particular pieces, we flew out to the houses of the players, a full production

233
00:14:00,947 --> 00:14:04,972
crew, interviewed them, learned about their stories and what they're about, talked to

234
00:14:04,992 --> 00:14:08,696
their families about, hey, what was it like when he wouldn't leave his room and played

235
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:12,061
Rocket League every day for ten hours, and now he's making thousands of dollars playing

236
00:14:12,081 --> 00:14:12,381
the game.

237
00:14:13,062 --> 00:14:15,062
We capture that, we create it.

238
00:14:15,282 --> 00:14:17,763
But it takes an entire team dedicated, traveling,

239
00:14:18,043 --> 00:14:20,204
to build these types of stories,

240
00:14:20,824 --> 00:14:23,205
and to build this narrative around Rocket League.

241
00:14:25,746 --> 00:14:27,426
Another really big piece is the live events.

242
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,487
Again, I could do an entire presentation on any of these,

243
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:30,888
especially the live events,

244
00:14:30,968 --> 00:14:33,809
but we did our last season two grand finals in Amsterdam.

245
00:14:34,589 --> 00:14:35,649
We had 1,200 people attend.

246
00:14:35,689 --> 00:14:38,270
We sold out tickets, I think, in two weeks,

247
00:14:38,350 --> 00:14:39,410
maybe a little bit less than that.

248
00:14:41,152 --> 00:14:43,213
But there are a million moving parts to a live event,

249
00:14:43,233 --> 00:14:45,773
from stage design to hospitality to hotel booking

250
00:14:45,833 --> 00:14:50,574
to transportation to visas are a huge topic now in e-sports.

251
00:14:50,634 --> 00:14:54,335
How do you get players from other countries into the US

252
00:14:54,375 --> 00:14:57,596
to play when it isn't recognized as an official sport

253
00:14:57,656 --> 00:14:59,356
by many organizations?

254
00:14:59,916 --> 00:15:01,296
These are all huge hurdles that you

255
00:15:01,336 --> 00:15:04,077
have to overcome that are important when coordinating

256
00:15:04,117 --> 00:15:05,157
a live event of this size.

257
00:15:05,717 --> 00:15:07,778
The investment for these can scale anywhere from $50,000

258
00:15:07,818 --> 00:15:08,978
to millions and millions of dollars.

259
00:15:11,439 --> 00:15:16,642
But the amount of work that goes into these things is astounding, putting on a massive

260
00:15:16,682 --> 00:15:19,203
live event, coordinating all these players.

261
00:15:20,124 --> 00:15:26,628
And I'll attest to the personal struggles I've had of coordinating 50, you know, 16

262
00:15:26,828 --> 00:15:33,032
to 18-year-old players internationally, moving them over to Amstram can be very, very challenging.

263
00:15:36,331 --> 00:15:42,075
And then regional expansion, and really how I should phrase this is go to where the players are.

264
00:15:42,996 --> 00:15:46,518
Oceania is where we've expanded the Rocket League Championship Series in Season 3,

265
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:53,683
because that's where there is a passionate fan base of players, a big group of players as well,

266
00:15:54,684 --> 00:16:01,628
that demand, they're just really, really demanding professional competition around Rocket League in their region.

267
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:08,488
And every time you expand, you run into the challenges of, can my rule set be legally

268
00:16:09,268 --> 00:16:10,429
enforced in this region?

269
00:16:10,509 --> 00:16:14,912
How do I do international play with these regions?

270
00:16:14,992 --> 00:16:21,576
How do you build a league that is culturally relevant to the player base that's unique

271
00:16:21,837 --> 00:16:22,857
to this region, too?

272
00:16:22,897 --> 00:16:27,160
So all of these things pop up and become extremely challenging as you think about regional expansion.

273
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:31,263
And you can expect, in our partnership with Psyonix around Rocket League.

274
00:16:31,807 --> 00:16:36,114
We'll continue to expand and we'll continue to have teams fully dedicated to thinking

275
00:16:36,134 --> 00:16:37,536
about how do we go into Brazil?

276
00:16:38,177 --> 00:16:41,842
How do we go into all these other regions that have all these unique challenges?

277
00:16:43,655 --> 00:16:48,079
And then lastly, I think the one more major piece is,

278
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,163
for us anyways, is event placement or slash TO support.

279
00:16:52,543 --> 00:16:55,305
How do we crowdsource competitive play?

280
00:16:55,345 --> 00:16:58,869
How do we get more people involved in running tournaments

281
00:16:58,929 --> 00:16:59,949
and playing in tournaments?

282
00:17:00,050 --> 00:17:02,712
And again, creating a competitive culture

283
00:17:02,732 --> 00:17:05,775
around the game is super, super important.

284
00:17:06,075 --> 00:17:10,599
Now I can't tell you where we're going to announce some stuff pretty soon, but a big part of our work is,

285
00:17:10,679 --> 00:17:13,561
hey, tournament organizer, what do you think about Rocket League?

286
00:17:13,801 --> 00:17:15,763
What is interesting to you? What do sponsors think?

287
00:17:15,803 --> 00:17:20,847
Like all these different things and advocating to have this at all of these major eSports events.

288
00:17:21,287 --> 00:17:24,190
Get it there, get more eyeballs on it, is a really important point.

289
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:27,553
Again, just driving engagement is really important.

290
00:17:29,018 --> 00:17:30,999
So I've talked about like five or six things.

291
00:17:31,139 --> 00:17:34,600
I'm just scratching the surface as to the amount of

292
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:38,201
work and the amount of things that are moving when you

293
00:17:38,301 --> 00:17:40,841
create a holistic e-sports ecosystem.

294
00:17:41,182 --> 00:17:43,142
I haven't even hit on all of the content that's

295
00:17:43,242 --> 00:17:44,082
created around this.

296
00:17:44,482 --> 00:17:46,503
I haven't hit on the web development needs that need to

297
00:17:46,543 --> 00:17:48,243
happen, hospitality and travel.

298
00:17:48,563 --> 00:17:52,184
There are a bunch of moving pieces with fully dedicated

299
00:17:52,264 --> 00:17:57,226
staff to resolving, to addressing all of these

300
00:17:57,266 --> 00:17:57,886
different pieces.

301
00:17:58,832 --> 00:18:01,896
So, again, it's all in an effort to support a holistic system.

302
00:18:02,497 --> 00:18:07,464
It would be much easier for us to do, you know, two or three major events a year and

303
00:18:07,524 --> 00:18:11,909
really throw all of our resources into that and then forget about all these other pieces.

304
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,993
But in doing that, we wouldn't have the results that we do.

305
00:18:15,816 --> 00:18:21,259
And so this is just from, I pulled this from an infographic that we have around the season

306
00:18:21,379 --> 00:18:24,081
two world championship for the Rocklea Championship Series.

307
00:18:26,542 --> 00:18:30,985
24.2 million minutes watched, over a million unique viewers, 1,200 live attendants, 3.9

308
00:18:31,025 --> 00:18:32,465
million Twitter impressions.

309
00:18:35,667 --> 00:18:40,474
This is a result of this holistic approach to eSports,

310
00:18:40,534 --> 00:18:41,896
and a really important piece too.

311
00:18:42,197 --> 00:18:43,138
Without all of these things,

312
00:18:43,399 --> 00:18:45,742
we do not believe we would be where we are today.

313
00:18:45,762 --> 00:18:48,706
And we see these numbers continuing to grow.

314
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,289
over time.

315
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:57,311
And as we continue to expand to different regions, as we continue to expand our efforts

316
00:18:57,351 --> 00:19:02,433
and the prestige of the RLCS continues to grow, we imagine these numbers are going to

317
00:19:02,453 --> 00:19:03,173
continue to go up.

318
00:19:03,894 --> 00:19:07,735
You can find this actually, the infographic from Season 2 on our RLCS Twitter account.

319
00:19:09,075 --> 00:19:12,937
And again, we're seeing even larger numbers for Season 3 as we venture into that too.

320
00:19:15,182 --> 00:19:17,163
So that's, again, that's a super high level.

321
00:19:17,203 --> 00:19:19,224
I can't believe I've already been talking for 20 minutes.

322
00:19:20,064 --> 00:19:21,425
There are a bunch of moving parts,

323
00:19:21,585 --> 00:19:23,645
and really, again, my takeaway for you is

324
00:19:24,366 --> 00:19:26,366
you guys are seeing probably a broadcast

325
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:30,188
or production on Twitch, but below the surface of that.

326
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,577
When we're talking about ESL events,

327
00:19:32,597 --> 00:19:34,037
when we're talking about all these different

328
00:19:34,418 --> 00:19:38,300
tournament organizers, there are insanely huge staff

329
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:41,081
supporting these massive events.

330
00:19:41,822 --> 00:19:43,463
In many cases much larger than what we have

331
00:19:43,503 --> 00:19:44,723
dedicated to the RLCS.

332
00:19:46,004 --> 00:19:47,405
And if you take shortcuts,

333
00:19:48,321 --> 00:19:52,565
In eSports, you will find yourself as a game company in the eSports graveyard.

334
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:58,893
You need to be thinking about a holistic approach that touches all of these pieces plus more.

335
00:19:58,913 --> 00:20:04,880
And so after this presentation, after Chris speaks at 11, I'll be out in the hall.

336
00:20:04,940 --> 00:20:06,402
I would love to talk to you guys and talk more.

337
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,444
If you have questions about this, I'm going to...

338
00:20:08,730 --> 00:20:10,210
I'll open the mic here in a second too.

339
00:20:11,031 --> 00:20:13,752
But again, just thinking about it's much, much bigger,

340
00:20:14,372 --> 00:20:16,212
much bigger than what you're seeing on Twitch.

341
00:20:16,833 --> 00:20:18,053
And in order to be successful,

342
00:20:18,733 --> 00:20:20,174
you need to have a lot of resources

343
00:20:20,654 --> 00:20:22,455
dedicated to supporting this effort.

344
00:20:23,675 --> 00:20:24,936
All right, so thank you very much.

345
00:20:24,956 --> 00:20:25,696
I want to open it up for questions.

346
00:20:36,342 --> 00:20:41,024
So, when you are trying to organize an event, you're obviously organizing many of your own

347
00:20:41,104 --> 00:20:42,484
regional events leading up to the major.

348
00:20:43,705 --> 00:20:47,646
At what point do you decide to partner with existing events, eSport events, like Dreamhack

349
00:20:47,666 --> 00:20:53,268
or PAX or whatnot, versus go and create your own event that's dedicated to the one game?

350
00:20:54,083 --> 00:21:09,255
Yeah, it's a really good question. So in our case what we generally do is we RFP, we'll request proposals from people in the ecosystem like, hey, we're thinking about doing this event, how would you do it and what's your take, right? And so then we weigh those proposals against like what

351
00:21:09,536 --> 00:21:12,738
What is it going to take and what is it going to cost to do it in-house?

352
00:21:12,758 --> 00:21:15,300
What's the comparison that we make?

353
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,521
Is it worth it for us to do it?

354
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:18,863
Do we expect a better fan experience?

355
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,024
Higher viewership?

356
00:21:20,184 --> 00:21:22,786
What's the marketing pull from these organizations?

357
00:21:23,206 --> 00:21:26,609
So we're weighing all of this value before we would move forward with something like

358
00:21:26,649 --> 00:21:26,789
that.

359
00:21:27,149 --> 00:21:28,450
But generally it's a big question.

360
00:21:28,470 --> 00:21:29,891
Like, do you want to continue to grow?

361
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:32,194
and it's the game player's answer.

362
00:21:32,214 --> 00:21:35,136
In this case, the answer is Petsco.

363
00:21:35,176 --> 00:21:36,156
This is a time dilator.

364
00:21:36,176 --> 00:21:37,997
If you taste the game Petsco, you double click on it.

365
00:21:38,017 --> 00:21:38,858
This is a config app.

366
00:21:38,978 --> 00:21:39,538
So if you tap on config...

367
00:21:39,558 --> 00:21:40,318
Petsco's after ONIC,

368
00:21:40,358 --> 00:21:41,499
you double click on it.

369
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:42,480
There's a whole set ofvention names

370
00:21:42,660 --> 00:21:43,320
that you can use

371
00:21:43,340 --> 00:21:44,140
and look at the different events

372
00:21:44,180 --> 00:21:45,201
that you have all over the world,

373
00:21:45,281 --> 00:21:46,502
and you can use these to lay down

374
00:22:01,171 --> 00:22:05,875
So generally when we think about who we're going to partner with as a tournament organizer,

375
00:22:05,915 --> 00:22:07,096
we look at their track record.

376
00:22:07,617 --> 00:22:12,361
We look at what have they done and have they been able to, how have they done with the

377
00:22:12,421 --> 00:22:13,662
resources that they have?

378
00:22:14,123 --> 00:22:18,647
And if they've shown that they've been able to do a lot with, you know, potentially in

379
00:22:18,707 --> 00:22:20,228
some cases limited resources.

380
00:22:21,816 --> 00:22:24,280
Is our contribution going to bring them to a new level?

381
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:25,923
Is it going to help them be more successful?

382
00:22:26,584 --> 00:22:27,947
Or do we think that they can be,

383
00:22:27,967 --> 00:22:30,512
they have the opportunity or they have the...

384
00:22:31,888 --> 00:22:37,690
They have the capacity to actually level themselves up to a point where you think it's worth supporting

385
00:22:37,730 --> 00:22:37,850
them.

386
00:22:38,310 --> 00:22:42,832
So my recommendation for you would be to run events and prove yourself, and I'm not sure

387
00:22:42,952 --> 00:22:48,895
how many you've done, and try to do something small that is indicative of your capability

388
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:52,636
and from there start requesting more support from the game company or other tournament

389
00:22:52,676 --> 00:22:56,778
organizers to help support your event based on your track record of success.

390
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,710
Hi.

391
00:23:02,230 --> 00:23:06,711
So I'm a member of the competitive fighting games

392
00:23:06,731 --> 00:23:07,111
community.

393
00:23:07,751 --> 00:23:09,692
And one thing I've noticed is that there's actually

394
00:23:09,792 --> 00:23:13,513
been a pushback towards the concept of e-sports

395
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:14,933
to the point where it's almost seen

396
00:23:15,513 --> 00:23:16,753
with a negative connotation.

397
00:23:17,234 --> 00:23:20,094
Because they see it as corporate kind

398
00:23:20,174 --> 00:23:22,435
of messing with grassroots events,

399
00:23:22,735 --> 00:23:25,516
enforcing rule changes, trying to clean up the community

400
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:28,676
to make it look better towards advertisers and sponsors.

401
00:23:29,417 --> 00:23:34,478
So what do you think is the best approach for a company that's kind of dealing with

402
00:23:35,078 --> 00:23:38,939
a community that doesn't necessarily want them to be involved?

403
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:40,779
Yeah, really good question.

404
00:23:41,119 --> 00:23:42,659
I've actually experienced this.

405
00:23:42,699 --> 00:23:46,140
I used to work for a company called the iGen Pro League a few years back.

406
00:23:46,180 --> 00:23:50,141
We actually tried to e-sportsify the FGC for a while.

407
00:23:50,181 --> 00:23:54,422
We did a show with Mike Ross and some other things and it was not received very well.

408
00:23:54,502 --> 00:23:55,642
So we learned a valuable lesson there.

409
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:59,899
More than anything, I think sponsors and organizations

410
00:23:59,999 --> 00:24:01,880
want to be authentic to the space.

411
00:24:02,981 --> 00:24:05,502
And so what is authenticity to the FGC?

412
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:08,164
If I'm a sponsor and I want to come in and support your event,

413
00:24:08,664 --> 00:24:10,725
I don't want to do it in a way that makes me look foolish.

414
00:24:11,486 --> 00:24:12,706
And so I actually want to be real

415
00:24:13,507 --> 00:24:15,068
and be able to relate with the community.

416
00:24:15,888 --> 00:24:18,770
So the FGC, it's tough because as you bring in sponsors,

417
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:21,211
sponsors innately are sort of like e-sports, I guess.

418
00:24:21,472 --> 00:24:23,453
The fact that there's money is sort of e-sports

419
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:24,754
as it relates to the FGC.

420
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:32,798
But really just showing what is interesting and unique about the FGC and why it's valuable for sponsors to get involved.

421
00:24:33,018 --> 00:24:38,541
How are they authentic and how can they activate in a way that is interesting and compelling to FGC fans?

422
00:24:38,561 --> 00:24:49,586
And if you can solve for that, I think you can maintain the identity of the FGC while also injecting more sustainability and money into the ecosystem as a whole.

423
00:24:51,147 --> 00:24:54,990
But yeah, I think the FGC wouldn't be what it is if you sort of like e-sportsify it.

424
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:58,393
So you have to continue to sort of, you know, keep that identity true.

425
00:24:59,554 --> 00:25:02,336
I think the sponsors are going to want that and the organizations are going to want that

426
00:25:02,376 --> 00:25:02,536
too.

427
00:25:03,597 --> 00:25:03,857
Okay.

428
00:25:03,897 --> 00:25:04,237
Thank you.

429
00:25:04,337 --> 00:25:07,119
Hey, Nick.

430
00:25:07,800 --> 00:25:11,463
I'm wondering if you have any thoughts given you talked a little bit about international

431
00:25:11,503 --> 00:25:17,908
stuff, how the current anti-immigration climate really affects things and the corollary.

432
00:25:18,909 --> 00:25:22,832
outfits like Twitch, other eSports organizers, game developers can do to address that?

433
00:25:23,252 --> 00:25:26,735
Yeah, it's a really good question, and something that we struggle with.

434
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,756
It is a systematic problem.

435
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:38,223
So there are all sorts of challenges when an organization, just being frank, with Twitch

436
00:25:38,263 --> 00:25:43,827
that's owned by Amazon, starts to lobby in sort of like government dealings.

437
00:25:44,648 --> 00:25:45,809
It becomes pretty challenging.

438
00:25:45,829 --> 00:25:46,329
There's a lot of.

439
00:25:47,027 --> 00:25:48,067
A lot of different steps.

440
00:25:49,728 --> 00:25:55,371
But I think we can be a testament to the credibility

441
00:25:56,072 --> 00:25:59,614
and opportunity in the eSports space because,

442
00:25:59,634 --> 00:26:01,535
I mean, we look at some of these eSports athletes,

443
00:26:01,615 --> 00:26:05,357
rumors of salaries over $500,000 a year

444
00:26:05,997 --> 00:26:08,238
in a game like League of Legends or CSGO.

445
00:26:09,079 --> 00:26:11,020
It's obvious that there is some skill,

446
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,681
there is some skill to this thing.

447
00:26:13,701 --> 00:26:16,303
It is a skill-based competition.

448
00:26:16,989 --> 00:26:25,498
And it's about sort of representing that in a way to the government or to the right entities to show like, hey, this is for real and you need to take it seriously.

449
00:26:27,553 --> 00:26:33,375
And so I think it starts with people sort of like rallying together and figuring out

450
00:26:33,415 --> 00:26:39,056
a strategy to communicate that in an effective way and partnering with the right entities

451
00:26:39,096 --> 00:26:46,078
within probably academia and the government as well to properly represent this skill-based

452
00:26:47,218 --> 00:26:48,478
thing that is eSports.

453
00:26:49,259 --> 00:26:51,819
There's a million different ways that we can do that, but I think it's going to take

454
00:26:51,859 --> 00:26:57,801
a bunch of different entities with credibility in the world to sort of represent that, hey,

455
00:26:58,101 --> 00:27:03,843
this is important and we need to resolve this issue because it's sort of being a blocker

456
00:27:03,863 --> 00:27:05,883
to continual growth in the eSports space.

457
00:27:07,825 --> 00:27:09,365
I think we have time for one or two more.

458
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:16,269
Could you tell me what percentage of eSports leagues slash events are managed by Twitch

459
00:27:16,409 --> 00:27:19,731
or with Twitch versus the rest of the space?

460
00:27:20,011 --> 00:27:20,391
Yeah, sure.

461
00:27:20,831 --> 00:27:28,935
So we partner with Capcom for the Capcom Pro Tour, and that's Street Fighter V. And we

462
00:27:28,995 --> 00:27:32,237
also partner with Psyonix around Rocket League.

463
00:27:32,992 --> 00:27:35,034
And so we have some other ones coming up as well.

464
00:27:35,074 --> 00:27:39,297
But generally we're pretty mindful to not sort of,

465
00:27:41,158 --> 00:27:42,899
we're very selective in who we partner with.

466
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,561
We also want to be mindful of the other players

467
00:27:45,621 --> 00:27:48,362
in the space and not come in and sort of like

468
00:27:49,783 --> 00:27:52,945
take over like these types of partnerships.

469
00:27:52,965 --> 00:27:56,168
There's a lot of great smart organizations

470
00:27:56,188 --> 00:27:59,970
like ESL, DreamHack in the space that are also great.

471
00:28:00,851 --> 00:28:02,572
to support your eSports efforts too.

472
00:28:02,692 --> 00:28:05,654
So we have two right now and we have a few more

473
00:28:05,674 --> 00:28:07,756
that you can expect to hear about in the next few months.

474
00:28:08,696 --> 00:28:09,997
But really we're just trying to be mindful

475
00:28:10,017 --> 00:28:12,139
of giving a little bit of a nudge in the right direction

476
00:28:12,459 --> 00:28:15,061
while also allowing the other really important players

477
00:28:15,101 --> 00:28:17,823
in the space to also enter into these partnerships

478
00:28:17,863 --> 00:28:19,344
and help point people in the right direction.

479
00:28:19,364 --> 00:28:21,626
All right, last one.

480
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:29,143
How are you guys expanding your fan base to different cultures and subcultures where they

481
00:28:29,223 --> 00:28:31,905
might not actually accept an eSport as a valid sport?

482
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:33,225
Yeah, good question.

483
00:28:35,486 --> 00:28:36,127
It's really hard.

484
00:28:36,567 --> 00:28:45,111
I think people have a general belief system as to what, like there's a general stigma

485
00:28:45,131 --> 00:28:46,332
around video games I think we can all...

486
00:28:46,755 --> 00:28:50,817
Everyone in the room can relate to that a little bit, and it's shrinking everyday.

487
00:28:52,338 --> 00:28:58,540
But generally our strategy is working and trying to identify what the core fan base,

488
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:04,442
less of the people that are on the periphery, that don't fully engage or believe in esports

489
00:29:04,502 --> 00:29:07,363
as a competitive aspect or something that's skill-based.

490
00:29:08,144 --> 00:29:13,406
But with that in mind, I think as eSports grows, as more and more stories about these

491
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:17,747
players making millions of dollars from either streaming or playing competitively start to

492
00:29:17,807 --> 00:29:24,549
surface, I think that will lend credibility to the fact that eSports is interesting, compelling,

493
00:29:25,090 --> 00:29:26,630
and something that you should pay attention to.

494
00:29:26,690 --> 00:29:32,732
So I think as this industry continues to grow, naturally people will be drawn to it as a

495
00:29:34,273 --> 00:29:36,935
Viewing behaviors around content in general are going to be changing.

496
00:29:37,315 --> 00:29:41,517
There's more cord cutters and people are moving into sort of like on-demand type viewing experience.

497
00:29:41,557 --> 00:29:46,560
That's more in line with like a Twitch viewing experience.

498
00:29:47,341 --> 00:29:51,783
And as that shift happens and again as eSports continues to build its credibility over time,

499
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:55,606
I think more people will be drawn to it and accepting of it

500
00:29:56,966 --> 00:30:00,168
in a way that many people in this room and myself are actively now.

501
00:30:02,433 --> 00:30:16,229
Cool, thanks very much guys, I'm going to hand it over to Chris, appreciate it.

502
00:30:16,389 --> 00:30:20,353
I'm getting set up here, as Nick mentioned, I'm Chris Wynn, I'm the Executive Producer

503
00:30:20,834 --> 00:30:22,155
on H1Z1 King of the Kill.

504
00:30:24,829 --> 00:30:29,633
You're going to hear a lot of very similar themes and takeaways as you did in Nick's presentation.

505
00:30:29,653 --> 00:30:33,216
It's almost like we coordinated, but I promise you we just met this morning.

506
00:30:33,797 --> 00:30:35,158
So I think maybe we're on to something here.

507
00:30:46,828 --> 00:30:51,952
Ultimately, to kind of talk about how we've been successful in eSports, it's a pretty complicated recipe.

508
00:30:52,725 --> 00:30:54,686
There's a lot of pieces that actually go into it.

509
00:30:55,207 --> 00:30:58,909
If I try to take away the biggest ingredient, you know, if this were chicken parmesan, chicken

510
00:30:58,929 --> 00:31:02,572
would be the biggest ingredient, and it's that we've taken the approach that we're going

511
00:31:02,592 --> 00:31:04,193
to partner very, very closely with our community.

512
00:31:04,974 --> 00:31:08,476
We didn't come out and say, here's the next big competitive game, here's the next eSport

513
00:31:08,496 --> 00:31:09,477
that you want to pay attention to.

514
00:31:09,917 --> 00:31:12,819
We put out a game that we thought was fun, and then we listened to the community kind

515
00:31:12,839 --> 00:31:16,582
of guide us to say, hey, we'd love to compete, here's what we'd like to see in the game,

516
00:31:16,602 --> 00:31:18,223
and then we worked with that into our roadmap.

517
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:23,016
and started to deliver a feature set to let them decide what was going to work and what wasn't going to work.

518
00:31:25,793 --> 00:31:30,017
If you're not familiar with H1Z1, uh, just real quickly, it's kind of a really new, unique

519
00:31:30,077 --> 00:31:33,740
game. Uh, it's a bit of an evolution of a shooter, a hundred and seventy five people

520
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:37,964
parachute into a big open world environment. Uh, when you hit the ground you gotta kinda

521
00:31:38,004 --> 00:31:41,948
scavenge around the world to look for weapons and equipment. Uh, it's gonna help you

522
00:31:42,128 --> 00:31:45,671
compete against all the other players in the world. There's no respawns, it's all single

523
00:31:45,691 --> 00:31:48,594
elimination, so everything's on the line for you as you, uh, play the game.

524
00:31:49,475 --> 00:31:53,136
What it does is build so much tension that when you win the game it feels like you're on top of

525
00:31:53,156 --> 00:31:57,777
the world. I've been working on this game for over a year. I have hundreds and hundreds of

526
00:31:57,817 --> 00:32:02,019
hours of gameplay. I have yet to win a game. It drives me absolutely nuts. I've come close a few

527
00:32:02,059 --> 00:32:07,100
times and I tell you it's, it, every time I'm in the top ten I'm like this is going to be it,

528
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,181
this is going to be it and then I fucking come in second or third.

529
00:32:14,203 --> 00:32:20,444
So far, we've taken a walk, not a run approach to what we're doing in the competitive community.

530
00:32:21,324 --> 00:32:24,945
So in 2015, we launched our first Invitational. We did this at TwitchCon.

531
00:32:25,545 --> 00:32:32,687
And what we did was invite 60 of our biggest streamers from Twitch to compete for over $170,000 in prize money.

532
00:32:33,427 --> 00:32:35,187
We raised that prize money with the community.

533
00:32:35,727 --> 00:32:39,588
And so we took a portion of proceeds that we sold from some in-game items and used that to form a prize pool.

534
00:32:40,989 --> 00:32:42,330
Ended up being very, very successful.

535
00:32:42,770 --> 00:32:45,192
It was the most watched program at TwitchCon that year.

536
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:49,855
It really kind of catapulted and sent H1Z1 off

537
00:32:50,036 --> 00:32:52,197
on a big trajectory that we're still following today.

538
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:58,863
Uh we followed that up in 2016 at TwitchCon again. We opened the uh the uh the field up a

539
00:32:58,883 --> 00:33:03,666
little bit. We had over 70 people involved. Prize pool got much bigger, over $250,000 this

540
00:33:03,886 --> 00:33:07,988
last year. Um again, big impression, a lot of people watching it. I think we had over a

541
00:33:08,068 --> 00:33:13,411
thousand hours of uh gameplay stream leaning up to the event. Um really exciting couple of

542
00:33:13,431 --> 00:33:17,853
matches and uh really kinda led to a lot of uh a lot of success for us.

543
00:33:18,802 --> 00:33:24,946
Um, what we've seen this year is, uh, really kind of beginning with, uh, with the 2016

544
00:33:24,986 --> 00:33:28,889
Invitational, we've started to see pro teams start to form around the event. Um, and when I

545
00:33:28,929 --> 00:33:32,812
put this slide together about a week ago, maybe a little over a week ago, we had, uh, I

546
00:33:32,852 --> 00:33:36,975
think six or seven pro teams announced. Um, they had announced, officially announced

547
00:33:37,035 --> 00:33:41,117
rosters to compete in H1Z1 and I think even since then we've had another three or four, um,

548
00:33:41,137 --> 00:33:44,700
as recently as yesterday I saw a couple of announcements from some teams. Um, that's

549
00:33:44,740 --> 00:33:47,321
leading up to our next event, which is called Fight for the Crown.

550
00:33:47,722 --> 00:33:51,744
What's cool about this, it will take place in March, it's going to air on the CW network

551
00:33:51,824 --> 00:33:55,046
in April in primetime, which is something we're really excited about.

552
00:33:55,446 --> 00:33:58,708
It's also going to be our first tournament using one of our team modes, so this will

553
00:33:58,728 --> 00:34:02,591
be 15 teams of 5 all competing to see who can be the last team standing.

554
00:34:03,731 --> 00:34:08,374
What's going to be really cool and what H1Z1 has that's really unique there is that we're

555
00:34:08,414 --> 00:34:11,236
the only game you can find where 15 teams can compete at the same time.

556
00:34:12,351 --> 00:34:15,519
Every other game is one v one, one team versus another team.

557
00:34:15,539 --> 00:34:17,483
And we can get every single team in there competing at once.

558
00:34:18,365 --> 00:34:19,548
A really unique cocktail and

559
00:34:19,568 --> 00:34:21,412
really unique mixture to see how that's gonna play out.

560
00:34:24,407 --> 00:34:25,067
So it's worked for us.

561
00:34:26,188 --> 00:34:28,048
We did really, really well in 2016.

562
00:34:28,128 --> 00:34:30,209
We were high up on the Steam charts.

563
00:34:31,149 --> 00:34:33,609
You can routinely find us in the top five stream games

564
00:34:33,669 --> 00:34:34,309
on Twitch right now.

565
00:34:34,329 --> 00:34:35,590
We're almost always in the top five.

566
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:37,990
In the last two weeks, we've been the number one

567
00:34:38,030 --> 00:34:40,071
selling title on Steam on their global top sellers list.

568
00:34:41,171 --> 00:34:42,371
The success has blown us away.

569
00:34:43,091 --> 00:34:44,912
Quite frankly, we're kind of sprinting to keep up,

570
00:34:45,572 --> 00:34:47,812
to make sure all of our services keep standing up

571
00:34:47,932 --> 00:34:49,253
and provide the best service as we can.

572
00:34:53,371 --> 00:34:56,376
So what about the game is kind of leading to that success?

573
00:34:56,396 --> 00:34:59,380
From our opinion, it breaks down to these kind of simple concepts.

574
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:03,266
So to start off with, the core of the game is actually very simple.

575
00:35:03,867 --> 00:35:05,029
You drop into an environment, you have to live.

576
00:35:05,329 --> 00:35:05,650
Don't die.

577
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,172
Right, that's pretty much it.

578
00:35:08,471 --> 00:35:10,792
But from there, there's actually a lot of depth layered into it.

579
00:35:10,812 --> 00:35:13,253
There's a ton of strategies that you need to employ when you hit the ground.

580
00:35:13,293 --> 00:35:13,974
Where do you land?

581
00:35:14,014 --> 00:35:15,255
How many other people land near you?

582
00:35:15,975 --> 00:35:16,876
What loot is around you?

583
00:35:16,916 --> 00:35:18,697
It's all randomly generated on the ground.

584
00:35:18,737 --> 00:35:23,019
So you can go in with a plan A, but you better be ready to go all the way to plan Z based

585
00:35:23,039 --> 00:35:23,960
on how the match plays out.

586
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:30,504
There's also a gas, a poisonous gas ring that slowly shrinks the map to shrink the play space.

587
00:35:30,964 --> 00:35:33,206
It's a 100 square kilometer open world environment.

588
00:35:34,026 --> 00:35:37,848
And so that's pretty important to keep the players together and competing.

589
00:35:39,600 --> 00:35:43,001
When we talk about competitive gaming, so I completely agree with Nick, please don't

590
00:35:43,021 --> 00:35:47,083
spell eSports with a capital S. In fact, we talk a lot about competitive gaming because

591
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:50,504
for us it's more than just the eSports, it's more than the spectacle of watching it, it's

592
00:35:50,524 --> 00:35:51,585
more than putting on the tournaments.

593
00:35:53,105 --> 00:35:57,227
The heart of our game is competitive and we want that to be open to every single player

594
00:35:57,267 --> 00:36:00,548
that participates in our game, not just the pros who get identified and picked up by teams.

595
00:36:02,049 --> 00:36:04,950
We really talk a lot about as we're building the game that we need to make sure it's fun

596
00:36:04,970 --> 00:36:05,230
to watch.

597
00:36:06,647 --> 00:36:12,052
No one's going to watch it if it's not fun to watch, and so we want to make sure that we keep the spectacle of watching the action as fun as possible.

598
00:36:12,112 --> 00:36:14,634
It's more than just playing the game. It's also how people are viewing it.

599
00:36:15,875 --> 00:36:19,418
And then, as I mentioned before, partnering with our community is a big part of what we do.

600
00:36:20,479 --> 00:36:25,984
It can be frustrating at times because you get a lot of negative feedback, but you have to understand that comes with the job and it comes with the territory.

601
00:36:26,584 --> 00:36:32,089
And you have to get to the root of what people are complaining about and get down to it and try to make a game that you know they're going to gravitate towards.

602
00:36:34,156 --> 00:36:36,158
So as mentioned in the simple concept of talk about this,

603
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,020
you know, again, very, very unique.

604
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:38,821
You're not gonna find a game

605
00:36:38,841 --> 00:36:41,323
where 175 people compete all at once.

606
00:36:41,343 --> 00:36:42,925
It's a huge open world.

607
00:36:42,965 --> 00:36:44,246
I mentioned 100 square kilometers

608
00:36:44,286 --> 00:36:45,347
and this shrinks over time.

609
00:36:45,387 --> 00:36:47,609
The course of one match takes about 35 minutes,

610
00:36:48,150 --> 00:36:48,731
start to finish.

611
00:36:48,811 --> 00:36:50,212
Most players are in there for a couple of minutes

612
00:36:50,252 --> 00:36:51,974
and then they're gonna filter out

613
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:52,835
and go into the next game.

614
00:36:56,073 --> 00:36:58,435
But that depth is really key, strategy is paramount.

615
00:36:59,275 --> 00:37:01,716
There are key distinct strategies that are employed

616
00:37:01,736 --> 00:37:03,717
in the early game versus the mid game versus the late game

617
00:37:03,737 --> 00:37:04,777
and it evolves very quickly.

618
00:37:05,358 --> 00:37:07,479
The early game's all about finding loot as fast as you can

619
00:37:07,499 --> 00:37:08,479
and clearing out any players

620
00:37:08,519 --> 00:37:09,459
that may have landed around you.

621
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,680
Mid game's about really setting yourself up

622
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:13,181
for the late game and late game is making sure

623
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,562
you have enough equipment to survive.

624
00:37:14,902 --> 00:37:16,823
You probably want a vehicle to get around the map on

625
00:37:16,943 --> 00:37:19,724
and set yourself up for those final 10

626
00:37:19,784 --> 00:37:21,185
that I kind of talked about.

627
00:37:22,119 --> 00:37:23,540
And you just have to be ready to adapt.

628
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,681
All the loot that spawns in the world is random.

629
00:37:25,701 --> 00:37:26,942
It's going to be different every single match.

630
00:37:27,962 --> 00:37:29,123
And I've talked about the moving gas.

631
00:37:29,583 --> 00:37:31,064
There's an element of crafting in our game.

632
00:37:31,104 --> 00:37:34,367
So you're going to pick up items and you're going to craft medical supplies

633
00:37:34,787 --> 00:37:36,428
and other things to kind of help you during the match.

634
00:37:36,508 --> 00:37:37,348
Armor, stuff like that.

635
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:40,811
And so understanding that depth of the game and what you need to find

636
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:43,432
in order to craft becomes a pretty big part of the skill mastery.

637
00:37:44,553 --> 00:37:46,194
Vehicles are a big part of the game.

638
00:37:46,755 --> 00:37:48,996
If you are at the end of the game and you don't have a vehicle,

639
00:37:49,016 --> 00:37:50,557
you're going to be at a distinct disadvantage right now.

640
00:37:51,400 --> 00:37:55,081
And so, again, more skill to learn there, more to master to learn where the vehicles

641
00:37:55,141 --> 00:37:58,561
are spawning at, and then finding one and understanding how to take care of it.

642
00:37:59,302 --> 00:38:02,262
It uses gas, it has health. You have to make sure you manage that.

643
00:38:02,843 --> 00:38:06,043
Which layers into, there's an RPG element of inventory management.

644
00:38:07,044 --> 00:38:11,004
And so you can only carry so much stuff. And you have to decide, am I going to carry this extra weapon

645
00:38:11,085 --> 00:38:15,406
or do I need more medpacks in case I get into a fight? Do I want smoke grenades

646
00:38:15,506 --> 00:38:16,526
or do I want frag grenades?

647
00:38:18,063 --> 00:38:20,884
All of this is to say you have to stay on your toes

648
00:38:21,064 --> 00:38:23,025
and there's a deceptive amount of depth to this game.

649
00:38:23,825 --> 00:38:26,266
It seems very simple, it can be very easy to describe

650
00:38:26,306 --> 00:38:28,647
but to get really good at it, it takes a long time.

651
00:38:32,569 --> 00:38:33,949
We talk about this at the office a lot.

652
00:38:34,449 --> 00:38:36,910
You know, when we build our competitive game we want anyone

653
00:38:37,211 --> 00:38:39,151
to be able to have a chance to succeed and do well.

654
00:38:39,832 --> 00:38:42,113
And so we talk about the average Joe becoming a pro.

655
00:38:43,794 --> 00:38:49,178
And so when we look at how we start to open up our competitive events, can we add a qualifying

656
00:38:49,218 --> 00:38:53,201
path that any person in our community has access to and we're not just picking, you

657
00:38:53,221 --> 00:38:55,322
know, the 50 best players in the world or something like that.

658
00:38:56,043 --> 00:38:57,384
And so we've built in leaderboards.

659
00:38:57,424 --> 00:38:59,545
We've worked with website Twin Galaxies.

660
00:38:59,586 --> 00:39:03,248
They have a, they partner with the team Echo Fox where they have also a set of leaderboards

661
00:39:03,268 --> 00:39:07,011
and we can use these things to determine where the skill is and you don't necessarily have

662
00:39:07,051 --> 00:39:10,473
to be, you know, a big personality on Twitch in order to get discovered.

663
00:39:10,891 --> 00:39:14,795
You can come at it from your skill set and be found and be invited to an event to compete.

664
00:39:15,876 --> 00:39:19,539
We have a whole meta on top of the game where every single match you play in gets scored.

665
00:39:20,981 --> 00:39:24,144
One thing that was really important to us there is that scoring system is non-punitive.

666
00:39:24,744 --> 00:39:28,588
So your top 10 scores from all your matches determine your place on a leaderboard and

667
00:39:28,608 --> 00:39:30,870
then you can work up different divisions and tiers through the leaderboard.

668
00:39:31,110 --> 00:39:32,151
But you're never going to go backwards.

669
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:36,015
We always want players to feel like they're progressing and that they have something to

670
00:39:36,075 --> 00:39:36,996
attain and work towards.

671
00:39:38,799 --> 00:39:42,902
And then like I said in the depth, it's getting players to focus on their own skill set and

672
00:39:42,962 --> 00:39:44,364
not blame things on the game.

673
00:39:44,384 --> 00:39:45,965
There's more to learn, there's more to watch on Twitch.

674
00:39:46,385 --> 00:39:50,889
I can go watch a good player and kind of see how they approach this strategy and get some

675
00:39:50,909 --> 00:39:53,391
tips to my own game so I can continue to refine my own experience.

676
00:39:54,928 --> 00:39:57,769
And then it's really about sharing that experience.

677
00:39:58,709 --> 00:40:02,030
We've done a pretty big in-game integration

678
00:40:02,070 --> 00:40:03,230
with Twitch with their API.

679
00:40:04,331 --> 00:40:06,652
So if you would like to try to get discovered,

680
00:40:06,732 --> 00:40:09,572
we sort based on maybe the number of wins you have

681
00:40:09,612 --> 00:40:10,653
or the number of kills you have,

682
00:40:11,433 --> 00:40:12,433
where you're at in the match.

683
00:40:12,513 --> 00:40:14,254
So someone might be interested to find

684
00:40:14,334 --> 00:40:15,774
the next really talented person

685
00:40:15,814 --> 00:40:17,195
as opposed to the next big personality.

686
00:40:17,975 --> 00:40:19,636
Again, it's trying to put an avenue for everybody.

687
00:40:19,676 --> 00:40:21,096
The big personalities are gonna get recognized,

688
00:40:21,116 --> 00:40:22,576
they're gonna get picked up by viewers anyway.

689
00:40:22,997 --> 00:40:24,678
But how can skilled players get found as well?

690
00:40:25,338 --> 00:40:26,599
And this is something that we're gonna continue

691
00:40:26,619 --> 00:40:28,820
to work on in the future to have a tighter

692
00:40:28,840 --> 00:40:29,961
and tighter integration with Twitch.

693
00:40:33,222 --> 00:40:34,203
Keeping it fun to watch.

694
00:40:34,943 --> 00:40:37,265
We talk a lot, the phrase we use is the game

695
00:40:37,285 --> 00:40:38,685
needs to be as fun to watch as it is to play.

696
00:40:39,886 --> 00:40:42,007
Starts with that very simple to understand game.

697
00:40:42,828 --> 00:40:44,449
It's a solo experience, there's no response,

698
00:40:44,469 --> 00:40:46,610
I can watch someone play, I know exactly what's going on

699
00:40:46,630 --> 00:40:47,851
and I don't have to worry about they're gonna die,

700
00:40:47,871 --> 00:40:49,551
they're gonna respawn at some other place in the map

701
00:40:49,591 --> 00:40:50,792
and I need to understand the map.

702
00:40:51,351 --> 00:40:55,814
so that I can keep track of their progress and what strategy they're employing at that particular time.

703
00:40:56,455 --> 00:40:58,837
As I'm watching someone play, it's really easy to kind of go,

704
00:40:58,857 --> 00:41:01,779
oh, you know what, if I was in that position, I would do this or I would do that.

705
00:41:02,639 --> 00:41:06,142
And that kind of opens up your mind into thinking, oh, you know, maybe I'd like to try this game.

706
00:41:06,162 --> 00:41:07,863
I think I can do better than that person I was just watching.

707
00:41:10,231 --> 00:41:13,092
The game naturally is set up with a good pace

708
00:41:13,532 --> 00:41:16,633
that lends itself pretty well to our streamers.

709
00:41:17,233 --> 00:41:18,954
They have time in between matches

710
00:41:19,034 --> 00:41:21,375
while they're loading out and loading in

711
00:41:21,395 --> 00:41:22,235
and getting ready for a new match.

712
00:41:22,255 --> 00:41:23,856
They even have time during games sometimes

713
00:41:24,256 --> 00:41:25,416
to interact with their viewers.

714
00:41:25,896 --> 00:41:27,657
So it makes it easy for them to call out subs,

715
00:41:27,677 --> 00:41:29,738
to call out tips, to interact and chat.

716
00:41:31,458 --> 00:41:32,699
And that's pretty important to them

717
00:41:32,719 --> 00:41:33,739
and it's pretty important to the viewers

718
00:41:33,779 --> 00:41:34,619
watching the experience.

719
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,500
And it's something our game lends very well to.

720
00:41:37,613 --> 00:41:41,554
I talked about the in-game Twitch integration and wanting to push that even further.

721
00:41:41,994 --> 00:41:45,875
And we spent a lot of time building those relationships with our community.

722
00:41:46,856 --> 00:41:50,996
We try to fly them out to the studio every so often, talk about a roadmap, get their

723
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:53,077
feedback, show the latest progress on the game.

724
00:41:54,157 --> 00:41:58,058
I talk to, I get texted every day from multiple members of our community.

725
00:41:58,898 --> 00:42:02,179
Sometimes not fun texts, but we deal with them all the same.

726
00:42:05,480 --> 00:42:10,483
And to kind of finish up on that secret sort of part of the recipe, our community and the

727
00:42:10,523 --> 00:42:12,124
competition is what drives the game.

728
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:17,187
We have a new feature rolling out in a few weeks that we're calling Hosted Games.

729
00:42:18,108 --> 00:42:22,631
What this allows is some grassroots participation in the competitive space.

730
00:42:22,671 --> 00:42:27,114
So we've done some stuff in the past, a little bit more manual, and this is a system to start

731
00:42:27,134 --> 00:42:29,035
to allow it a little bit in a larger scale.

732
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,861
where we did some things around Champions Arena, where they bring in, they invite the

733
00:42:32,901 --> 00:42:36,002
best players from the community, where they compete every single week and have a lot of

734
00:42:36,022 --> 00:42:36,862
fun to see who's the best.

735
00:42:37,823 --> 00:42:43,985
We do things with Chicken Dinner Show, which is a show run by a few people on Twitch, where

736
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:46,106
they also do some competitions and some fun stuff.

737
00:42:47,106 --> 00:42:50,528
And we've had a lot of international support that we're trying to open up as well.

738
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:55,189
We've already run events in North America and Europe and Japan in terms of our community

739
00:42:55,210 --> 00:42:57,290
grassroots stuff, and we want to open that up even further.

740
00:42:58,066 --> 00:43:00,087
as we support more and more of the globe.

741
00:43:01,607 --> 00:43:05,509
The Invitational is a big part of, it's kind of the heart of our competition right now,

742
00:43:05,529 --> 00:43:09,010
as we did in 2015-2016, we're going to do it again in 2017.

743
00:43:09,830 --> 00:43:12,411
The first year was really just kind of, what can we do here?

744
00:43:13,131 --> 00:43:16,933
And then we were able to open it up last year by expanding a little bit more internationally,

745
00:43:16,953 --> 00:43:22,074
brought some players in from Brazil, we brought players in from Europe, we had a player qualify on site from Korea.

746
00:43:22,935 --> 00:43:26,556
And so that's something that we want to continue in the future and even grow even more.

747
00:43:27,777 --> 00:43:31,158
The fight for the crown, the next big event that we have going on will be our expansion

748
00:43:31,198 --> 00:43:32,559
into team games, team tournaments.

749
00:43:33,379 --> 00:43:37,221
We think with this and a few other features we have rolling out in the next month, we're

750
00:43:37,241 --> 00:43:41,303
going to see our popularity of our five, particularly our five man, but also our two man mode just

751
00:43:41,603 --> 00:43:42,584
grow exponentially.

752
00:43:43,584 --> 00:43:46,806
We think that's really going to take off when we unlock some potential there.

753
00:43:47,946 --> 00:43:50,187
And then the way we interact with our community is really important to us.

754
00:43:50,905 --> 00:43:53,186
I personally run regular Reddit AMAs.

755
00:43:53,226 --> 00:43:54,227
I try to do it every other week.

756
00:43:55,167 --> 00:43:58,449
I try to respond as much as I can on Twitch or on Twitter.

757
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:02,051
I regularly watch our streamers play the game

758
00:44:02,071 --> 00:44:03,972
because I'm looking to see what they're doing,

759
00:44:04,012 --> 00:44:05,692
what's sort of the new trends coming up in the game,

760
00:44:05,733 --> 00:44:07,954
things I need to be aware of, things that maybe we need to fix,

761
00:44:09,114 --> 00:44:11,515
but also just interact with them to find out what's frustrating you,

762
00:44:11,535 --> 00:44:12,796
what are you liking, how's it going,

763
00:44:13,537 --> 00:44:14,757
what do we need to put some focus on.

764
00:44:15,624 --> 00:44:19,207
And I also, again, personally, I write a, I try to do it every month where I write a

765
00:44:19,247 --> 00:44:20,308
producer letter to the community.

766
00:44:20,709 --> 00:44:23,431
Here's our current focus, here's what we're hearing, here's what we're trying to get fixed

767
00:44:23,471 --> 00:44:23,992
up for you guys.

768
00:44:24,873 --> 00:44:27,335
It's that just regular constant contact.

769
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:31,759
And it kind of, like I said, it's sort of get ready to kind of get the good and the

770
00:44:31,779 --> 00:44:32,120
bad with it.

771
00:44:35,752 --> 00:44:38,953
So what got us here is gonna continue to guide us

772
00:44:38,993 --> 00:44:39,473
into the future.

773
00:44:40,634 --> 00:44:43,635
As we look to expand the number of events we run,

774
00:44:44,155 --> 00:44:46,837
so expand outside of TwitchCon and start to partner

775
00:44:46,857 --> 00:44:48,477
with places like DreamHack and some other things

776
00:44:48,517 --> 00:44:49,398
to run even more events.

777
00:44:50,718 --> 00:44:52,219
We want to expand even more globally.

778
00:44:52,659 --> 00:44:55,240
We have a tremendous growth curve in Asia right now.

779
00:44:56,021 --> 00:44:57,121
So how can we tap into that?

780
00:44:57,181 --> 00:44:58,562
We're already very, very popular in Europe.

781
00:44:58,582 --> 00:44:59,542
How can we do more in Europe?

782
00:45:00,963 --> 00:45:03,084
And just continue to grow the game.

783
00:45:03,855 --> 00:45:05,916
With the focus being on the competitive aspect of it.

784
00:45:09,097 --> 00:45:10,838
So I should have some time for some questions.

785
00:45:12,419 --> 00:45:13,720
I'll quite possibly give some answers.

786
00:45:32,182 --> 00:45:36,765
Hey, so I have a question regarding the prime time showing in the CW. Seeing how like you have

787
00:45:36,785 --> 00:45:42,008
different game lengths for each match, how do you guys control it so like every big game

788
00:45:42,028 --> 00:45:47,172
that's streamed fits within the time requirements of like, you know, prime time? Yeah, that's a

789
00:45:47,192 --> 00:45:53,756
great question. So, uh, how do we handle a TV broadcast when the, when the game length can be

790
00:45:53,796 --> 00:45:56,398
varying? Um, it's pre-recorded, so...

791
00:45:57,385 --> 00:46:02,186
We will record the game play in the tournament in mid-March, and then we get a month to edit it.

792
00:46:02,966 --> 00:46:05,747
And we can fill in with content as we need to to fill in our broadcast.

793
00:46:09,328 --> 00:46:11,488
Yeah, what's up?

794
00:46:12,288 --> 00:46:15,689
I was wondering, when you look at the community and you hear their feedback,

795
00:46:15,709 --> 00:46:17,769
to find out what they like and what they enjoy about your game,

796
00:46:18,730 --> 00:46:20,730
how did you collect the data? Did you get it through Reddit?

797
00:46:20,750 --> 00:46:23,230
Did you get it specifically through them writing to you?

798
00:46:23,290 --> 00:46:24,151
Did you, the Reddit MMAs?

799
00:46:26,162 --> 00:46:27,863
Yeah, so how do we collect the feedback?

800
00:46:28,143 --> 00:46:29,363
It essentially comes from everywhere.

801
00:46:29,423 --> 00:46:32,325
So it's not just the AMAs,

802
00:46:32,385 --> 00:46:34,706
it's also what people are posting in Reddit every single day.

803
00:46:34,726 --> 00:46:35,567
I try to go on there every night

804
00:46:35,587 --> 00:46:37,528
and just kind of get apprised of what's going on.

805
00:46:37,548 --> 00:46:40,750
I see what people are posting to me, to Twitter.

806
00:46:40,830 --> 00:46:42,431
We talk to our customer service department

807
00:46:42,451 --> 00:46:43,471
to see what people are reporting.

808
00:46:44,652 --> 00:46:45,852
One-on-one individual contact

809
00:46:45,913 --> 00:46:47,754
with some of the players in the community,

810
00:46:47,774 --> 00:46:51,015
as well as we occasionally put out player surveys

811
00:46:51,556 --> 00:46:53,437
to collect more empirical data

812
00:46:53,477 --> 00:46:55,158
to try to guide some decisions that we're making.

813
00:46:55,902 --> 00:46:57,623
But ultimately it's a collection of all that stuff.

814
00:46:58,284 --> 00:47:01,125
And then as we look for trends and different themes of areas

815
00:47:01,145 --> 00:47:03,306
where we want to go put some focus on the game, we try to

816
00:47:03,466 --> 00:47:06,668
collate it all into one big chunk of feedback to go, OK,

817
00:47:06,688 --> 00:47:07,429
this is what we're going to do.

818
00:47:07,849 --> 00:47:08,449
I think that's awesome.

819
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:09,109
Give it up.

820
00:47:11,451 --> 00:47:11,871
How's it going?

821
00:47:12,211 --> 00:47:12,351
Good.

822
00:47:13,292 --> 00:47:15,173
Congrats on bringing the game to the CW.

823
00:47:15,553 --> 00:47:16,293
That's really exciting.

824
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:20,876
Can you share more about that courting process or what it is

825
00:47:20,936 --> 00:47:24,458
that attracted them to you and you to them?

826
00:47:25,461 --> 00:47:27,882
Yeah, so how did the CW come about?

827
00:47:28,603 --> 00:47:32,665
Quite honestly, it's a little bit of fortune, a little bit of luck, a little bit of hard work.

828
00:47:33,485 --> 00:47:38,288
We have a pretty close partnership with Rick Fox, who owns Team Echo Fox,

829
00:47:38,948 --> 00:47:41,290
and his team was the first to get involved with H1Z1.

830
00:47:41,350 --> 00:47:46,673
And so as he has had lots of contacts with his other teams around League of Legends and CSGO

831
00:47:46,693 --> 00:47:47,693
and the other teams that he runs,

832
00:47:48,554 --> 00:47:52,816
the opportunity kind of grew a little bit from Echo Fox and CW.

833
00:47:53,827 --> 00:47:58,768
And then we got involved as part of that and it all worked out as a great partnership for

834
00:47:58,788 --> 00:47:59,488
all three of us.

835
00:48:00,068 --> 00:48:00,348
Awesome.

836
00:48:00,609 --> 00:48:00,969
Congrats.

837
00:48:01,269 --> 00:48:01,529
Thank you.

838
00:48:04,210 --> 00:48:04,550
Hi there.

839
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:04,950
Hi.

840
00:48:05,530 --> 00:48:10,451
So you talked a lot about listening to your community about what their needs and their

841
00:48:10,471 --> 00:48:15,273
wants were, but how deliberate were you in the beginning in shaping that community, if

842
00:48:15,353 --> 00:48:20,234
at all, and making sure that it was accessible and comfortable for all kinds of players?

843
00:48:21,685 --> 00:48:25,627
Well that's a good question. So how do we go about shaping the community? Um, you know,

844
00:48:25,687 --> 00:48:30,390
ultimately I'd say it started very, almost grassroots-ish. Uh, lots of people in the, on the

845
00:48:30,410 --> 00:48:33,753
dev team just reaching out to different, different people in the community and starting to

846
00:48:33,773 --> 00:48:38,296
build relationships with them and starting to talk to them on a regular basis. Um, in a lot of

847
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:42,038
cases there's a lot of pretty close friendships, uh, that have, that have developed over the

848
00:48:42,078 --> 00:48:42,598
last two years.

849
00:48:44,664 --> 00:48:49,406
I think it's also been, I've been at, I've been on H1Z1 for a little over a year now.

850
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:51,347
I think this is also a little bit of Daybreak's DNA.

851
00:48:52,347 --> 00:48:55,929
Having formerly been Sony Online Entertainment with EverQuest and some of the other games

852
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:58,510
they built, being close to their community was always part of what they did.

853
00:48:59,631 --> 00:49:04,613
And so it sort of naturally fit into H1Z1 as we began to develop that game and thought

854
00:49:04,633 --> 00:49:05,334
about where it could go.

855
00:49:05,354 --> 00:49:07,015
So it was really...

856
00:49:08,300 --> 00:49:10,801
I think it was probably a little bit less intentional than maybe the answer you were

857
00:49:10,941 --> 00:49:14,803
originally thinking, but definitely just part of the natural thinking of the studio and

858
00:49:14,823 --> 00:49:15,784
natural culture of the studio.

859
00:49:16,464 --> 00:49:16,825
Thank you.

860
00:49:20,447 --> 00:49:25,369
So you chose to run invitational style events based on kind of popularity of content creators

861
00:49:25,409 --> 00:49:28,751
versus say meritocracy, people that won a lot.

862
00:49:29,412 --> 00:49:32,453
And I'm just curious, in those events, how were you able to leverage kind of the personalities

863
00:49:32,473 --> 00:49:34,034
of the players in an event that they weren't kind of streaming themselves?

864
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:34,094
So,

865
00:49:34,114 --> 00:49:34,134
I

866
00:49:34,154 --> 00:49:34,274
didn't

867
00:49:34,294 --> 00:49:34,414
really

868
00:49:34,434 --> 00:49:34,514
know

869
00:49:34,534 --> 00:49:34,615
what

870
00:49:34,635 --> 00:49:34,655
I

871
00:49:34,675 --> 00:49:34,735
was

872
00:49:34,755 --> 00:49:34,855
doing.

873
00:49:34,875 --> 00:49:34,895
I

874
00:49:34,915 --> 00:49:34,975
was

875
00:49:34,995 --> 00:49:35,075
just

876
00:49:35,095 --> 00:49:35,175
kind

877
00:49:35,215 --> 00:49:35,255
of

878
00:49:35,275 --> 00:49:35,415
waiting

879
00:49:35,435 --> 00:49:35,495
for

880
00:49:35,515 --> 00:49:35,615
the

881
00:49:35,635 --> 00:49:35,715
next

882
00:49:35,755 --> 00:49:35,875
event.

883
00:49:35,895 --> 00:49:35,975
When

884
00:49:35,995 --> 00:49:36,055
I

885
00:49:36,075 --> 00:49:36,255
started

886
00:49:36,275 --> 00:49:36,356
this

887
00:49:36,376 --> 00:49:36,456
show,

888
00:49:36,476 --> 00:49:36,496
I

889
00:49:36,516 --> 00:49:36,576
was

890
00:49:36,596 --> 00:49:36,776
actually

891
00:49:36,796 --> 00:49:36,876
like

892
00:49:36,896 --> 00:49:37,096
sitting

893
00:49:37,777 --> 00:49:41,099
Yeah, so how did we leverage the personalities of the streamers kind of to our benefit in

894
00:49:41,119 --> 00:49:41,759
the Invitational?

895
00:49:42,699 --> 00:49:44,580
We did it a lot in kind of the lead up to it.

896
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:48,462
So we did a lot of promotional content, a lot of marketing content that would focus

897
00:49:48,522 --> 00:49:49,323
on some of the streamers.

898
00:49:49,383 --> 00:49:54,585
We did some pretty big things on the streamers that won the year before or the winners from

899
00:49:54,605 --> 00:49:55,065
the year before.

900
00:49:55,766 --> 00:50:00,248
And the way we generate the prize pool is with an in-game crate that has vanity items

901
00:50:00,268 --> 00:50:00,668
for players.

902
00:50:01,168 --> 00:50:05,470
A lot of those, most of the items in that crate are based on the personalities playing

903
00:50:05,490 --> 00:50:05,910
in the tournament.

904
00:50:06,831 --> 00:50:08,793
So like Ninja is one of our big streamers.

905
00:50:09,133 --> 00:50:10,895
There was a Ninja shirt the first year.

906
00:50:10,935 --> 00:50:13,617
There was a Ninja gun skin the second year.

907
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,539
So we kind of partner with them to put them into the crate

908
00:50:16,559 --> 00:50:17,280
and promote them a bit.

909
00:50:18,061 --> 00:50:18,241
Great.

910
00:50:22,124 --> 00:50:22,664
All right, perfect.

911
00:50:23,125 --> 00:50:24,446
Thanks a lot you guys for attending.

912
00:50:24,846 --> 00:50:26,307
They asked me to remind you to please fill out

913
00:50:26,347 --> 00:50:28,849
the evaluations as you leave.

914
00:50:29,550 --> 00:50:30,771
And I hope you enjoy GDC.

915
00:50:31,151 --> 00:50:31,351
Thanks.
