00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,465
Hello, this is Monica.

2
00:00:13,465 --> 00:00:15,907
Thank you for coming to our talk about what

3
00:00:15,907 --> 00:00:18,329
being neurodivergent means in game development.

4
00:00:18,329 --> 00:00:20,530
Before we started, there's a couple of things

5
00:00:20,530 --> 00:00:22,131
I just want to say.

6
00:00:22,131 --> 00:00:24,633
First of all, this is a safe space.

7
00:00:24,633 --> 00:00:26,594
We want to make sure we respect each other,

8
00:00:26,594 --> 00:00:27,935
everyone feel comfortable,

9
00:00:27,935 --> 00:00:30,216
and as this is a neurodivergent panel,

10
00:00:30,216 --> 00:00:32,078
we understand everyone is different,

11
00:00:32,078 --> 00:00:33,178
have different accommodations,

12
00:00:33,178 --> 00:00:34,859
so please do whatever you need

13
00:00:34,859 --> 00:00:36,761
to make yourself feel safe and comfortable.

14
00:00:37,361 --> 00:00:41,423
And the second thing is, please, after this talk,

15
00:00:41,423 --> 00:00:42,884
rate us on the GDC app.

16
00:00:42,884 --> 00:00:45,905
It will be very, very helpful to get your feedback

17
00:00:45,905 --> 00:00:46,905
on how we can do better.

18
00:00:46,905 --> 00:00:50,387
The third thing is, after the talk,

19
00:00:50,387 --> 00:00:53,748
we're going to have a Q&A at the wrap room.

20
00:00:53,748 --> 00:00:59,111
It's going to be on the same floor on the other side.

21
00:00:59,111 --> 00:01:02,312
So if we cannot answer your question right here,

22
00:01:02,312 --> 00:01:03,433
please come to the wrap room.

23
00:01:03,433 --> 00:01:04,193
We'll all be there.

24
00:01:04,814 --> 00:01:08,235
And that's it.

25
00:01:08,235 --> 00:01:09,216
Hello.

26
00:01:09,216 --> 00:01:09,956
I'm Monica.

27
00:01:09,956 --> 00:01:12,657
My pronoun is she, they.

28
00:01:12,657 --> 00:01:16,419
And I am a game designer currently working at Shell Game.

29
00:01:16,419 --> 00:01:19,341
I have been diagnosed as neurodiverse.

30
00:01:20,201 --> 00:01:21,822
before I had memories.

31
00:01:21,822 --> 00:01:25,584
Over the years, I have been through a lot of different experiences.

32
00:01:25,584 --> 00:01:28,766
I went from trying, learning how to mask myself,

33
00:01:28,766 --> 00:01:32,128
learning how to behave normally and struggle with it,

34
00:01:32,128 --> 00:01:37,611
to today, I'm standing here trying to tell everyone that

35
00:01:37,611 --> 00:01:39,012
it's okay to be different.

36
00:01:39,012 --> 00:01:41,993
And in the gaming industry,

37
00:01:41,993 --> 00:01:44,395
it's sometimes a very good advantage.

38
00:01:46,631 --> 00:01:49,793
This is why I decided to give this talk,

39
00:01:49,793 --> 00:01:54,516
because during the COVID, I think a lot of things happened.

40
00:01:54,516 --> 00:01:58,099
And to me, I started to notice is

41
00:01:58,099 --> 00:02:00,601
there's, I have a lot of friends who are neurodivers

42
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:03,943
who are like the most talented game dev I've ever known.

43
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:06,305
However, a lot of us share the struggle

44
00:02:06,305 --> 00:02:09,087
of having to work in a neurotypical working condition

45
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:10,448
and has to follow the rules

46
00:02:10,448 --> 00:02:14,711
that does not really work best for us.

47
00:02:14,711 --> 00:02:15,451
And the other...

48
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:21,898
thing is, I've seen a lot of like, team that has like a

49
00:02:21,898 --> 00:02:26,880
neurodiverse team, but the game is still designed very oriented

50
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:30,681
towards neurotypical. It has something to do with what we

51
00:02:30,681 --> 00:02:35,823
assume gamers are, which is not really the truth. So to my hope

52
00:02:35,823 --> 00:02:38,923
is by giving this talk, we can start a conversation about how

53
00:02:38,923 --> 00:02:42,144
to design game and how to make game that is for everyone.

54
00:02:43,825 --> 00:02:50,447
The third thing is, my most driving force of giving this talk is I have been helping

55
00:02:50,447 --> 00:02:53,047
with some students and mentor some students.

56
00:02:53,047 --> 00:02:58,969
And I have a lot of people asking me, I have ADHD, I'm on the spectrum, I don't know if

57
00:02:58,969 --> 00:03:00,629
I'm able to be a game dev.

58
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:06,037
To me it's very shock because of course you are and

59
00:03:06,037 --> 00:03:10,343
I as someone who went through many different career

60
00:03:10,343 --> 00:03:15,812
I can see game development is definitely the career for me, and it's the only place I've been thriving

61
00:03:15,812 --> 00:03:15,912
so

62
00:03:17,114 --> 00:03:24,398
But then I look around, I couldn't give a lot of good examples because there really isn't a lot of game devs talking about this topic yet.

63
00:03:24,398 --> 00:03:31,482
So I hope by giving this talk, by showing so many talented people on the panel,

64
00:03:31,482 --> 00:03:38,286
we can give more people to be like, yes, you can absolutely thrive to be neurodiverse and be a game dev.

65
00:03:39,526 --> 00:03:45,168
I'm very lucky today we have eight different speakers from very different backgrounds

66
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:48,229
and to share their own stories.

67
00:03:48,229 --> 00:03:50,669
So I hope you enjoy the talk.

68
00:03:50,669 --> 00:03:53,050
I hope this is like inspiring.

69
00:03:53,050 --> 00:03:55,571
And yeah.

70
00:03:55,571 --> 00:03:56,551
We are starting.

71
00:03:56,551 --> 00:03:58,372
The first and the best.

72
00:03:58,372 --> 00:03:59,492
One of the best.

73
00:03:59,492 --> 00:04:01,273
We see how you do, Monica.

74
00:04:01,273 --> 00:04:02,793
Thank you.

75
00:04:02,793 --> 00:04:03,733
Thank you.

76
00:04:03,733 --> 00:04:03,933
Thank you.

77
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:04,113
Thank you.

78
00:04:04,113 --> 00:04:04,373
Thank you.

79
00:04:05,286 --> 00:04:08,327
We have Samara Jade Sendek. Her name, her pronoun is she, her.

80
00:04:08,327 --> 00:04:12,229
And she's a narrative designer all the way from Australia.

81
00:04:12,229 --> 00:04:12,529
Yoday.

82
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:14,150
So as you might have heard, I'm Samara Jade,

83
00:04:14,150 --> 00:04:14,270
Teresa,

84
00:04:14,270 --> 00:04:14,510
Sendek.

85
00:04:34,827 --> 00:04:38,030
So welcome to Neurodivergence, Masking, and the Workplace,

86
00:04:38,030 --> 00:04:43,033
where for the next six minutes, I'll be shouting words

87
00:04:43,033 --> 00:04:45,955
at your face about what it is to be neurodivergent,

88
00:04:45,955 --> 00:04:50,279
masking, and what your workplace can do to help you

89
00:04:50,279 --> 00:04:51,239
or help your coworkers out.

90
00:04:51,239 --> 00:04:56,563
So a little bit about me is, yes, I'm a narrative designer,

91
00:04:56,563 --> 00:05:01,367
writer, QA tech from lovely Narm, or QA tech,

92
00:05:03,706 --> 00:05:07,988
as the white fellas there call it, Melbourne.

93
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:14,712
So all that's basically, so you know I'm good to talk.

94
00:05:14,712 --> 00:05:17,193
I was the writer and narrative designer

95
00:05:17,193 --> 00:05:19,314
on Game of Thrones' Taylor Crowes.

96
00:05:19,314 --> 00:05:19,995
I'm writing for.

97
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:27,515
A team, well, one of my local teams, Dragon Maze Studios on Enchanted.

98
00:05:27,515 --> 00:05:30,996
I also worked on an Amazon Alexa skill called Daily Boost.

99
00:05:30,996 --> 00:05:33,597
It is with Taberno Voices.

100
00:05:33,597 --> 00:05:35,278
It's not up there.

101
00:05:35,278 --> 00:05:39,239
And all the rest of it, I'm also on G14 Classified Materials.

102
00:05:39,239 --> 00:05:39,659
Hush hush.

103
00:05:39,659 --> 00:05:45,301
So I'm going to begin with a few comforting habits.

104
00:05:45,301 --> 00:05:46,982
The first thing, also from Australia.

105
00:05:46,982 --> 00:05:47,402
I'd like to...

106
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:51,922
acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land, the Ohlone peoples.

107
00:05:51,922 --> 00:06:00,546
Secondly, I'm going to begin, well, I'm going to begin the actual talk now

108
00:06:00,546 --> 00:06:01,006
with a pithy quote.

109
00:06:01,006 --> 00:06:05,008
Under the present brutal and primitive conditions on this planet,

110
00:06:05,008 --> 00:06:08,250
every person you meet should be regarded as one of the walking wounded.

111
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:12,572
We have never seen anyone not slightly deranged by either anxiety or grief.

112
00:06:12,572 --> 00:06:14,833
We have never seen a totally sane human being.

113
00:06:15,999 --> 00:06:24,025
So, segueing right into that, we have one of our best buddies from the darkest dungeon, Baldwin.

114
00:06:24,025 --> 00:06:32,290
So, where we go with this talk is that Baldwin has an ability in camp, it's called let down the mask.

115
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:40,136
So, if Baldwin does this, he relieves a lot of stress on himself. It helps keep him calm,

116
00:06:40,136 --> 00:06:43,658
it helps keep him push helps him push through the dangers of the darkest dungeon.

117
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,569
Unfortunately, it wigs everyone else out.

118
00:06:46,569 --> 00:06:47,849
They're not used to seeing a leper.

119
00:06:47,849 --> 00:06:51,771
This is, this is like they're not,

120
00:06:51,771 --> 00:06:53,432
they're seeing something they're not used to.

121
00:06:53,432 --> 00:07:02,016
So, it's what it's like to mask for neurodivergent people.

122
00:07:02,016 --> 00:07:04,677
It's to cover up, cover up and put anxiety

123
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:06,678
and grief on ourselves.

124
00:07:10,439 --> 00:07:15,662
And it's because wider society won't see us as...

125
00:07:15,662 --> 00:07:19,984
Sorry, I've got my notes on my phone because I can't read it on the laptop.

126
00:07:23,105 --> 00:07:25,667
I was like, yeah, everywhere I go, I mind how I walk.

127
00:07:25,667 --> 00:07:27,828
I don't touch certain metals.

128
00:07:27,828 --> 00:07:29,930
And it's because I'll feel sick if I do.

129
00:07:29,930 --> 00:07:36,515
And I need to mind how I speak, because I believe it or not

130
00:07:36,515 --> 00:07:40,278
was assaulted in primary school, because I talked funny.

131
00:07:40,278 --> 00:07:43,561
So why are we having this talk?

132
00:07:43,561 --> 00:07:45,662
And why am I breaking out social norms

133
00:07:45,662 --> 00:07:46,503
and laying out some trauma?

134
00:07:46,503 --> 00:07:48,024
So simply put.

135
00:07:48,687 --> 00:07:55,729
practice what you preach with accessibility. And you really can't begin to design or

136
00:07:55,729 --> 00:07:59,630
develop for accessibility unless you start at the studio itself. So, basics. The

137
00:07:59,630 --> 00:08:08,373
keep it simple silly version of masking is hiding character traits to look like

138
00:08:08,373 --> 00:08:11,713
everyone else. We're mimicking, in short.

139
00:08:13,335 --> 00:08:17,237
We look like you, we talk like you, we act like you,

140
00:08:17,237 --> 00:08:19,138
because we'll get the bad stuff.

141
00:08:19,138 --> 00:08:20,958
Like bad stuff will happen to us if we don't.

142
00:08:20,958 --> 00:08:23,319
Like,

143
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:30,122
like we, like, we have to act,

144
00:08:30,122 --> 00:08:32,423
we have to do this, we have to do this act

145
00:08:32,423 --> 00:08:33,563
because we can't perceive the world

146
00:08:33,563 --> 00:08:38,685
in the way a labeled neurotypical would.

147
00:08:38,685 --> 00:08:41,186
There was a study,

148
00:08:41,186 --> 00:08:42,246
it was a study some time ago.

149
00:08:42,974 --> 00:08:49,216
about, let's just pretend this is a box. So, it was between uh, neurotyp- like

150
00:08:49,216 --> 00:08:56,499
neurotypical and autistic kids. Now, the researcher said there was a very special

151
00:08:56,499 --> 00:09:02,100
way to open the box. These kids, like the neurotypical kids, followed the exact

152
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:06,902
same pattern. Lift it up, lift it down, turn it upside down, shake it all about,

153
00:09:06,902 --> 00:09:12,704
and then, open the box. Autistic kids just skip the process and open the box.

154
00:09:15,692 --> 00:09:22,193
Unfortunately, under masking, we have to do it the long ways method, otherwise, you know,

155
00:09:22,193 --> 00:09:23,793
we get screened at.

156
00:09:23,793 --> 00:09:25,494
We get assaulted.

157
00:09:25,494 --> 00:09:28,054
We get blamed for when vaccines go bung.

158
00:09:28,054 --> 00:09:28,394
So it's acting.

159
00:09:28,394 --> 00:09:33,515
And that takes us to performative societies.

160
00:09:33,515 --> 00:09:36,196
And what I mean by that is exactly what's on the slide.

161
00:09:36,196 --> 00:09:39,237
Society itself is theater, and daily life is a stage.

162
00:09:39,758 --> 00:09:45,541
So another example there is like, you might be, you know, walking down the street and then you see someone trip and they go,

163
00:09:45,541 --> 00:09:46,762
Oh, I've been fine.

164
00:09:46,762 --> 00:09:50,403
I would have been fine if it wasn't for that thing right there.

165
00:09:50,403 --> 00:09:53,705
And then they just continue on their merry way.

166
00:09:53,705 --> 00:09:55,226
That's performative society.

167
00:09:55,226 --> 00:10:04,450
They just like this act, this dance that people try to do to make sure everything else is fine and seemly.

168
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:09,212
It's a front that's part of masking for us.

169
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:20,974
So, masking is the deliberate and often painful attempt to look like everyone else. Again,

170
00:10:20,974 --> 00:10:26,796
we must think like you. We must talk like you. We must act like you to save ourselves.

171
00:10:26,796 --> 00:10:35,939
So, solutions. Masking is bad. Yes, it puts stress on us. It puts stress on the team. And

172
00:10:35,939 --> 00:10:41,080
if no one really knows who or what they're dealing with, consequences can be severe.

173
00:10:42,030 --> 00:10:48,762
So the good news is the things that can help us neurodivergent people can also help everyone

174
00:10:48,762 --> 00:10:50,445
else in the building.

175
00:10:50,445 --> 00:10:51,106
So it's a win-win.

176
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:58,696
Uh, key items in meetings. So things like, uh, fidget spinners, fidget cubes, uh, like if they

177
00:10:58,696 --> 00:11:05,540
wear collars, collars, that works too. Um, anything to basically help stim. It just takes the pressure

178
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:11,203
off us, uh, in any given situation. I don't exactly have a stim toy with me, but you might

179
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:17,146
have noticed me rolling my shoulders and clenching my fists, having a nervous chuckle now and again,

180
00:11:17,146 --> 00:11:20,588
and then pausing to punctuate a point.

181
00:11:22,133 --> 00:11:25,114
That's all stim, that's stim material for me.

182
00:11:25,114 --> 00:11:27,794
And that helps me, helps keep me calm and collected

183
00:11:27,794 --> 00:11:30,835
and deliver this presentation.

184
00:11:30,835 --> 00:11:34,236
Nextly, if we do get overstimulated,

185
00:11:34,236 --> 00:11:37,857
if we do, if like the walls are closing in around us

186
00:11:37,857 --> 00:11:41,558
and we need to bug out, we need an area to calm down in.

187
00:11:41,558 --> 00:11:45,098
This can also work for neurotypical people.

188
00:11:45,098 --> 00:11:46,679
It's like, they're just having a little too much

189
00:11:46,679 --> 00:11:47,739
on their plate.

190
00:11:48,990 --> 00:11:56,093
So, if this does happen, please keep in mind that overstimulation and a meltdown is trauma.

191
00:11:56,093 --> 00:12:02,935
We're doing it to escape a painful context, and the brain will do anything it takes to make the

192
00:12:02,935 --> 00:12:09,898
pain stop. So, in regards to that, have a lot of sick leave. Lots of it. Most anglophonic countries

193
00:12:09,898 --> 00:12:14,580
will have at least, like, five, maybe ten days of sick leave, like, written into federal law.

194
00:12:15,910 --> 00:12:19,671
have double that. Because you're going to have, you're going to run into comorbid depression,

195
00:12:19,671 --> 00:12:28,033
anxiety, fibro, celiac, the works. There's just a lot of comorbidities. And lastly, have

196
00:12:28,033 --> 00:12:34,275
some nonverbal, nonwritten communication. So, I'm slightly dyscalculic. I can't do

197
00:12:34,275 --> 00:12:41,016
maths. My sister is dyslexic. She struggles to read. And I have a lot more friends and

198
00:12:41,016 --> 00:12:44,237
family who just, they can't talk. They can communicate just fine.

199
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:48,081
you know, not with the pie hole.

200
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:50,823
It's way more common than you think.

201
00:12:50,823 --> 00:12:53,405
Like, if it, and if you've got deliverables due,

202
00:12:53,405 --> 00:12:56,587
just like, you know, if it can get the point down faster

203
00:12:56,587 --> 00:13:01,350
by like writing it down, by doing a pretty picture,

204
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:04,192
or hell, if you've got time, let them,

205
00:13:04,192 --> 00:13:06,614
let them make a build.

206
00:13:06,614 --> 00:13:10,196
I knew a guy who actually made a build one time

207
00:13:10,196 --> 00:13:12,858
and, whew, worked fast.

208
00:13:14,074 --> 00:13:17,976
Now, capping off, remember, please, that we are human.

209
00:13:17,976 --> 00:13:19,917
We are doing our best.

210
00:13:19,917 --> 00:13:22,378
Autistic people are specialists forced

211
00:13:22,378 --> 00:13:23,679
to live in a generalist society.

212
00:13:23,679 --> 00:13:28,121
Like, mass media today demands every little bit

213
00:13:28,121 --> 00:13:30,883
of an ADHD person's executive function.

214
00:13:30,883 --> 00:13:34,685
And post-traumatic people are still

215
00:13:34,685 --> 00:13:37,146
trying to navigate horrors no one was really

216
00:13:37,146 --> 00:13:39,567
meant to withstand, evolutionarily speaking.

217
00:13:41,408 --> 00:13:45,312
Like we, and believe it or not, we all do talk to each other.

218
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:50,256
We are watching you and we do know when and how you treat us

219
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:50,977
differently.

220
00:13:50,977 --> 00:13:58,903
Everyone on this panel has gift wrapped you a cookbook on how to help your fellow

221
00:13:58,903 --> 00:14:02,947
neurodivergent people. It's one thing to stick A11y on your webpage.

222
00:14:02,947 --> 00:14:07,751
It's another thing entirely to execute it. Now, execute it.

223
00:14:07,751 --> 00:14:08,651
Thank you.

224
00:14:12,445 --> 00:14:18,449
No pressure.

225
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,010
So, going up?

226
00:14:21,010 --> 00:14:23,672
Yep, I would also like to take the opportunity

227
00:14:23,672 --> 00:14:26,194
to introduce the wonderful, magnificent,

228
00:14:26,194 --> 00:14:27,735
magnanimous Mr. Radiant G.

229
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:29,256
Hello everyone.

230
00:14:42,688 --> 00:14:47,934
I am Radyin Chi, and I'm not really going to have any slides up there.

231
00:14:47,934 --> 00:14:49,516
I'm just going to tell you all a story instead.

232
00:14:49,516 --> 00:14:52,280
I'm Radyin Chi.

233
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:58,868
My pronouns are he, him, and I'm an indie game dev, artist, writer, and game journalist.

234
00:14:58,868 --> 00:15:00,030
I am also dyslexic.

235
00:15:01,247 --> 00:15:03,608
I actually didn't know for most of my life.

236
00:15:03,608 --> 00:15:07,668
I thought the words and letters moved around for everyone.

237
00:15:07,668 --> 00:15:10,369
It definitely made certain aspects of school

238
00:15:10,369 --> 00:15:11,649
difficult growing up.

239
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:15,330
And it's a huge barrier when a great new book comes out

240
00:15:15,330 --> 00:15:18,190
that everyone's talking about and I haven't read it.

241
00:15:18,190 --> 00:15:22,651
That said, I don't dislike being dyslexic.

242
00:15:22,651 --> 00:15:26,452
I just don't like when things that could be accessible,

243
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:26,752
aren't.

244
00:15:28,261 --> 00:15:31,944
I want to start off my section with a quick story.

245
00:15:31,944 --> 00:15:34,927
Once I was talking to someone online about where we thought our

246
00:15:34,927 --> 00:15:37,188
spirits would go when we die.

247
00:15:37,188 --> 00:15:42,373
And I know that sounds like a dark topic to some, but to us, it really wasn't.

248
00:15:42,373 --> 00:15:43,414
It was interesting.

249
00:15:43,414 --> 00:15:47,617
And I remember them saying to me that they wish the afterlife was a library

250
00:15:47,617 --> 00:15:51,120
filled with books of everything that ever happened in history.

251
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,962
And you could just sit down and read it forever.

252
00:15:55,604 --> 00:16:02,729
I jokingly, but also seriously, said, well, I wouldn't wish that because I'm dyslexic.

253
00:16:02,729 --> 00:16:05,592
To which they said, well, you're dyslexic on earth.

254
00:16:05,592 --> 00:16:08,714
That doesn't mean you'd have to be dyslexic in heaven.

255
00:16:08,714 --> 00:16:09,715
My reply?

256
00:16:09,715 --> 00:16:11,896
My dyslexia is a part of me.

257
00:16:11,896 --> 00:16:14,558
I wouldn't want to not be dyslexic in heaven.

258
00:16:14,558 --> 00:16:16,900
That would be losing a part of myself.

259
00:16:16,900 --> 00:16:18,822
I would want heaven to be accessible.

260
00:16:19,825 --> 00:16:23,414
The person I was talking to went silent for a few seconds and said,

261
00:16:23,414 --> 00:16:26,802
you know, I never really thought about disability like that before.

262
00:16:27,701 --> 00:16:33,766
So I hope today that anyone here who assumed anyone disabled would choose to be abled,

263
00:16:33,766 --> 00:16:38,150
if they could, to also rethink the way that you see disability.

264
00:16:38,150 --> 00:16:43,574
When things are made accessible to me, my dyslexia can even become an advantage.

265
00:16:43,574 --> 00:16:46,737
Sure, I'm more likely than my peers to have a typo,

266
00:16:46,737 --> 00:16:50,960
but I'm also better equipped than my peers to check if something is accessible.

267
00:16:52,552 --> 00:16:58,396
Last year I worked on an indie game where our UX UI person, Star St. Germain, shout out,

268
00:16:58,396 --> 00:17:04,600
made an alien font from scratch. It was awesome. One of our mini games involved looking at two

269
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,463
lines of characters and seeing if any of the symbols were mistyped in the second line.

270
00:17:09,463 --> 00:17:13,246
I was the one Star came to to check over all of the symbols and let her know which

271
00:17:13,246 --> 00:17:16,448
ones were too similar or confusing, especially to a dyslexic eye.

272
00:17:17,634 --> 00:17:23,997
We worked together to change the few symbols that needed changing and ended up with a much more accessible game because of it.

273
00:17:23,997 --> 00:17:29,499
Accessibility consulting is powerful and rewarding, and I love doing that.

274
00:17:29,499 --> 00:17:33,720
Now, not to say it's all positive to be dyslexic in games.

275
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:38,562
I've also had rather poor experiences in gaming due to it, too.

276
00:17:38,562 --> 00:17:41,143
If a game is not accessible, I can't play it.

277
00:17:42,070 --> 00:17:47,512
I have been recommended games and downloaded them only to not be able to read the UI and

278
00:17:47,512 --> 00:17:49,992
have to tell my friends, sorry, I can't play with you.

279
00:17:49,992 --> 00:17:58,074
But you know, that's just how it is sometimes.

280
00:17:58,074 --> 00:18:03,895
And I've also been to cons where I've felt embarrassed that I have to turn away or walk

281
00:18:03,895 --> 00:18:09,677
away from a game demo that somebody is showing or spoken to with derision when I ask a developer

282
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:11,657
for help with a demo that isn't accessible.

283
00:18:12,297 --> 00:18:17,959
they treat me like a liability. You know, I can tell when I'm being treated by someone in an

284
00:18:17,959 --> 00:18:25,982
ableist manner. It's not hard to pick up on and it's not fun. I admit that I actually cried once

285
00:18:25,982 --> 00:18:32,364
in a demo chair at PAX because I was struggling to play a game and the people weren't helping me

286
00:18:32,364 --> 00:18:39,126
and it was, you know, it was frustrating. I'm not afraid to admit that, like sometimes it is hard.

287
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:41,467
Yeah, all of that said though.

288
00:18:42,196 --> 00:18:45,699
The silver lining is that every day in this industry,

289
00:18:45,699 --> 00:18:48,101
I want to work towards building a better tomorrow.

290
00:18:48,101 --> 00:18:50,564
And I know that sounds cheesy,

291
00:18:50,564 --> 00:18:53,126
but I really do want to build a better tomorrow

292
00:18:53,126 --> 00:18:57,410
for accessibility, for inclusivity,

293
00:18:57,410 --> 00:19:00,493
so that less people have to feel the bad side

294
00:19:00,493 --> 00:19:00,833
of all of this.

295
00:19:00,833 --> 00:19:04,696
I have brought up several accessibility changes

296
00:19:04,696 --> 00:19:07,019
at both dev and journalism jobs of mine.

297
00:19:07,943 --> 00:19:11,325
And they've gotten implemented relatively quickly

298
00:19:11,325 --> 00:19:12,546
whenever I bring them up.

299
00:19:12,546 --> 00:19:16,508
These changes and step forwards don't just make working a

300
00:19:16,508 --> 00:19:19,710
better experience for me, but also everyone like me

301
00:19:19,710 --> 00:19:24,053
that comes here before or after me.

302
00:19:24,053 --> 00:19:26,454
I'll end this off by saying that.

303
00:19:27,687 --> 00:19:32,028
If y'all ever want to hit me up, my Twitter is right up there.

304
00:19:32,028 --> 00:19:35,968
If you're dyslexic and you want to talk to someone and build community, that's awesome.

305
00:19:35,968 --> 00:19:40,049
If you're not and you just have questions or anything you want to say, feel free.

306
00:19:40,049 --> 00:19:41,910
My DMs are always open.

307
00:19:41,910 --> 00:19:47,251
And last but not least, dyslexic folks in gaming, untie.

308
00:19:47,251 --> 00:19:48,931
Sorry, sorry.

309
00:19:48,931 --> 00:19:49,231
Unite.

310
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,532
Thank you.

311
00:20:00,502 --> 00:20:07,206
All right, next up, I'd like to introduce our first remote guest of the night,

312
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:10,808
the wonderful Cameron Hopkinson.

313
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:11,129
Thank you.

314
00:20:11,129 --> 00:20:16,012
Good morning, everyone.

315
00:20:16,012 --> 00:20:20,274
It is currently 6 a.m. here, so if I seem a little drowsy, please bear with me.

316
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:23,796
So my name is Cameron.

317
00:20:23,796 --> 00:20:28,319
I am a Game Access Push consultant, composer and programmer from New Zealand,

318
00:20:28,319 --> 00:20:29,420
and I am autistic.

319
00:20:30,337 --> 00:20:35,201
Attending events such as conferences and networking events is often described as crucial for anyone

320
00:20:35,201 --> 00:20:40,244
looking at breaking into the games industry, yet I have struggled a lot at events due to

321
00:20:40,244 --> 00:20:41,645
being autistic.

322
00:20:41,645 --> 00:20:45,688
This will be a quick chat about a few things that events can do and have done that will

323
00:20:45,688 --> 00:20:48,570
help make them more manageable.

324
00:20:48,570 --> 00:20:56,636
I am going to focus on in-person events just because of time.

325
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,713
Also, my setup is to do no fault of GDC a bit,

326
00:21:02,713 --> 00:21:04,754
so bear with me for that as well.

327
00:21:04,754 --> 00:21:07,194
But first, a quick disclaimer.

328
00:21:07,194 --> 00:21:13,496
Autism is a disability that has a vast number of symptoms.

329
00:21:13,496 --> 00:21:16,237
Severity of each of these symptoms

330
00:21:16,237 --> 00:21:19,858
varies partly from autistic person to autistic person.

331
00:21:19,858 --> 00:21:21,659
Text speaking, there are some autistic people

332
00:21:21,659 --> 00:21:22,859
that are nonverbal.

333
00:21:22,859 --> 00:21:24,060
They cannot talk at all.

334
00:21:24,813 --> 00:21:28,295
There are some like me who have what is called selective mutism,

335
00:21:28,295 --> 00:21:30,737
where we cannot talk in certain situations,

336
00:21:30,737 --> 00:21:35,220
and there are autistic people that have absolutely no problem speaking whatsoever.

337
00:21:35,220 --> 00:21:40,844
While there is a lot of overlap in our collective autistic experiences,

338
00:21:40,844 --> 00:21:43,746
there is no universal autistic experience.

339
00:21:43,746 --> 00:21:47,009
Not everything in this talk is going to apply to every autistic person,

340
00:21:47,009 --> 00:21:49,370
but taking the following into consideration

341
00:21:49,370 --> 00:21:51,872
will help make your events more accessible to autistic people.

342
00:21:57,871 --> 00:22:03,597
One thing that you can do to make your events more accessible for autistic people is to have a dedicated quiet area.

343
00:22:03,597 --> 00:22:09,162
This gives people a space to go if they need to decompress because everything has gotten to be too much.

344
00:22:09,162 --> 00:22:13,586
This kind of space can easily be the difference between an autistic person having a meltdown or not.

345
00:22:13,586 --> 00:22:17,150
So if you're running an event, please consider having a dedicated quiet area.

346
00:22:17,878 --> 00:22:22,122
The only thing to keep in mind with this is that there will need to be people there to enforce it.

347
00:22:22,122 --> 00:22:26,225
Otherwise you risk the room simply becoming another space for networking,

348
00:22:26,225 --> 00:22:29,107
which kind of defeats the purpose of that space.

349
00:22:29,107 --> 00:22:35,491
If you're hosting a networking event, avoid playing music.

350
00:22:35,491 --> 00:22:39,514
When I have gone to networking events that have played music,

351
00:22:39,514 --> 00:22:42,777
it has generally just made the event louder.

352
00:22:42,777 --> 00:22:46,199
It can get harder to make out what anybody is saying.

353
00:22:46,842 --> 00:22:50,243
A lot of autistic people have auditory processing difficulties.

354
00:22:50,243 --> 00:22:56,425
They make it hard to make out what a person is saying if lots of other people are speaking.

355
00:22:56,425 --> 00:23:02,706
And everyone yelling louder to be heard over everyone just worsens the issue.

356
00:23:02,706 --> 00:23:07,607
And it's not like the music will be audible for anyone or people trying to yell over it anyway.

357
00:23:07,607 --> 00:23:10,108
If an event is a party, then feel free to play music.

358
00:23:10,108 --> 00:23:14,569
But if the aim of the event is for people to network, please keep it off.

359
00:23:18,466 --> 00:23:26,452
Incense and flashlights, which can be a feature of all shows and other occasions, can be highly

360
00:23:26,452 --> 00:23:32,256
distressing to autistic people and can easily lead to meltdowns. One way to make your event more

361
00:23:32,256 --> 00:23:37,240
accessible to autistic people is to avoid these if at all possible. Another reason to avoid flashing

362
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,603
lights is because of the risk of seizures for people that have epilepsy, which happens to be a

363
00:23:41,603 --> 00:23:47,968
common comorbidity for autistic people, which means a lot of autistic people also have epilepsy.

364
00:23:48,867 --> 00:23:53,670
Seizures are serious and can easily lead to serious injury, so minimizing the risk that

365
00:23:53,670 --> 00:23:59,593
someone could have a seizure is very important, not only just for the sake of your attendees,

366
00:23:59,593 --> 00:24:03,095
but for the sake of your wallet because lawsuits can and do happen.

367
00:24:03,095 --> 00:24:14,582
Another way to make your event more accessible is to restrict the number of people who attend.

368
00:24:14,903 --> 00:24:20,845
A lot of game dev events will try and shove as many people into a space as physically possible,

369
00:24:20,845 --> 00:24:27,127
which makes events inaccessible to us for two reasons. The first is that the event,

370
00:24:27,127 --> 00:24:30,708
it means the event becomes a lot of people trying to yell over each other,

371
00:24:30,708 --> 00:24:35,970
which as I've explained already, is an issue. The second reason is that it makes it near

372
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:38,370
impossible to move around without people bumping into you.

373
00:24:39,452 --> 00:24:43,176
Generally, autistic people do not like being touched unexpectedly.

374
00:24:43,176 --> 00:24:46,078
Filling your event up to fire capacity makes this inevitable.

375
00:24:46,078 --> 00:24:51,583
Also, restricting the number of people at your event helps physically disabled people,

376
00:24:51,583 --> 00:24:55,366
as it is near impossible to move around a cramped venue using mobility aids

377
00:24:55,366 --> 00:24:57,068
such as a walking stick and a wheelchair.

378
00:25:02,928 --> 00:25:06,730
Something I've seen some conferences do is have stickers at registration that

379
00:25:06,730 --> 00:25:10,851
they can play that attendees can place on their badges to tell people what kind of

380
00:25:10,851 --> 00:25:14,573
interactions they're comfortable with. For example, you can have stickers to

381
00:25:14,573 --> 00:25:18,514
indicate whether you're okay with hugs, just handshake, or if you want people to not touch

382
00:25:18,514 --> 00:25:23,276
you at all. You could also have stickers about whether you would want people to

383
00:25:23,276 --> 00:25:26,537
start conversations with you or whether you just want to be left alone.

384
00:25:27,081 --> 00:25:30,122
This is great for autistic people for multiple reasons.

385
00:25:30,122 --> 00:25:32,742
First of all, it lets autistic people easily dictate

386
00:25:32,742 --> 00:25:35,543
how much contact they want with others.

387
00:25:35,543 --> 00:25:37,943
A lot of autistic people do not like being hugged,

388
00:25:37,943 --> 00:25:39,803
especially by people they don't know.

389
00:25:39,803 --> 00:25:43,024
So having something on your badge to tell people

390
00:25:43,024 --> 00:25:45,004
not to hug you will help keep that from happening.

391
00:25:45,004 --> 00:25:47,945
Secondly, it makes it easier for autistic people

392
00:25:47,945 --> 00:25:49,885
to initiate conversations with people.

393
00:25:49,885 --> 00:25:53,366
A lot of us struggle with social cues and neurotypical people,

394
00:25:53,366 --> 00:25:54,806
so it can be hard to determine

395
00:25:54,806 --> 00:25:56,367
if someone is wanting to chat or not.

396
00:25:56,852 --> 00:26:03,834
these stickers can help misguide that awkwardness.

397
00:26:03,834 --> 00:26:09,076
Anyway, that is a small and non-exhaustive list of things that can be done to help make events more accessible.

398
00:26:09,076 --> 00:26:17,258
Hopefully that helps some of you who are looking at organizing events in the future.

399
00:26:17,258 --> 00:26:19,199
And that is me.

400
00:26:19,199 --> 00:26:20,479
And yeah, if you want to...

401
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:23,824
I won't be at Q&A afterwards because it's virtual.

402
00:26:23,824 --> 00:26:26,568
So feel free to reach out to me if you have any questions

403
00:26:26,568 --> 00:26:28,372
or anything like that.

404
00:26:28,372 --> 00:26:30,575
Otherwise, I will pass on to Emily.

405
00:26:45,030 --> 00:26:47,031
Hi, my name is Emily Stel.

406
00:26:47,031 --> 00:26:50,454
I'm going to talk a bit about my journey and career

407
00:26:50,454 --> 00:26:53,097
in the industry.

408
00:26:53,097 --> 00:26:53,297
Sorry.

409
00:26:53,297 --> 00:26:55,979
I'm going to talk a bit about my personal experiences finding

410
00:26:55,979 --> 00:26:59,102
employment and self-acceptance through games.

411
00:26:59,102 --> 00:27:04,807
I'm at the very start of my journey and career

412
00:27:04,807 --> 00:27:05,788
in the industry in general.

413
00:27:05,788 --> 00:27:10,612
And actually, I'm at the very start of my.

414
00:27:11,675 --> 00:27:14,819
journey and career in the industry and actually work in general.

415
00:27:14,819 --> 00:27:19,545
Last year I started my first job ever as a junior game designer back home in the UK.

416
00:27:19,545 --> 00:27:26,194
I'm also artistic. It's one of my professional and professional goals

417
00:27:26,194 --> 00:27:29,818
to one day be able to say that without all the accompanying anxiety.

418
00:27:30,822 --> 00:27:34,725
There's still a lot of stigma and misconceptions surrounding autism,

419
00:27:34,725 --> 00:27:38,488
and I even worry that being openly autistic could hurt my career,

420
00:27:38,488 --> 00:27:42,191
especially as a designer where communication is such a key thing.

421
00:27:42,191 --> 00:27:46,695
I spent a few years not in employment, education or training,

422
00:27:46,695 --> 00:27:49,958
and the word communication became something of a spectre for me.

423
00:27:49,958 --> 00:27:54,081
As an autistic person, it's easy to look through job descriptions

424
00:27:54,081 --> 00:27:58,244
and see requirements like excellent communication skills

425
00:27:58,244 --> 00:28:00,066
and think, well...

426
00:28:00,556 --> 00:28:05,800
that excludes me, but there's something that took me some time to figure out.

427
00:28:05,800 --> 00:28:09,904
Finding something difficult isn't actually the same thing as being bad at it.

428
00:28:09,904 --> 00:28:16,129
But how can someone with a condition that's usually characterized by a deficit in social

429
00:28:16,129 --> 00:28:23,555
communication actually be good at communication? Well, part of it is practice. Perhaps I've

430
00:28:23,555 --> 00:28:26,557
gained these skills a little slower than most people.

431
00:28:26,881 --> 00:28:31,443
but I can still learn and grow and improve, even in difficult areas.

432
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,883
Part of it is sheer force of will.

433
00:28:33,883 --> 00:28:38,165
Struggling with something often means spending a lot more time thinking about it

434
00:28:38,165 --> 00:28:39,385
than the average person.

435
00:28:39,385 --> 00:28:42,547
And a big part of it is that

436
00:28:42,547 --> 00:28:45,608
communication is a really big concept

437
00:28:45,608 --> 00:28:49,149
and not all of it is actually required to be effective in employment.

438
00:28:50,204 --> 00:28:54,628
So I might not always remember to ask you how your day was,

439
00:28:54,628 --> 00:28:57,991
but I can communicate my ideas about video games effectively.

440
00:28:57,991 --> 00:29:04,216
All right, so maybe finding communication difficult

441
00:29:04,216 --> 00:29:07,538
doesn't actually exclude me from being a game designer.

442
00:29:07,538 --> 00:29:10,721
Is it possible that being autistic

443
00:29:10,721 --> 00:29:13,203
makes me a better game designer?

444
00:29:13,777 --> 00:29:19,861
This is a slightly difficult issue for me. I think there's a tendency in businesses to advocate for

445
00:29:19,861 --> 00:29:25,204
diversity exclusively because of the benefits it can bring, but there's still an argument to be

446
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:31,088
made that the advantages are irrelevant, and including more people is reason enough to do

447
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:38,253
something, but I won't push that point too hard right now. Because there are many positive traits

448
00:29:38,253 --> 00:29:42,836
associated with autism, and a lot of them are very useful in game design.

449
00:29:43,581 --> 00:29:48,263
things like curiosity, creativity, and attention to detail.

450
00:29:48,263 --> 00:29:50,725
But for me, it's passion.

451
00:29:50,725 --> 00:29:54,147
I've never been as interested in anything

452
00:29:54,147 --> 00:29:55,828
as much as I am in video games.

453
00:29:56,719 --> 00:30:01,261
And I used to think that was quite sad, like some kind of personal failing.

454
00:30:01,261 --> 00:30:05,842
But now, to have the opportunity to channel that passion into a career and a purpose,

455
00:30:05,842 --> 00:30:10,083
I find it's actually a strength that helps me in my role every day.

456
00:30:10,083 --> 00:30:15,825
And for me, that passion runs so deep that I don't think I could do anything else.

457
00:30:15,825 --> 00:30:24,328
Starting work in the games industry has been both the hardest and the best thing I've ever done in my life.

458
00:30:25,387 --> 00:30:29,790
I spent a lot of years thinking I wasn't capable of very much.

459
00:30:29,790 --> 00:30:34,974
Receiving my first job offer was a real turning point for me, and it wasn't until that moment

460
00:30:34,974 --> 00:30:37,436
that I actually wondered if I could do it.

461
00:30:37,436 --> 00:30:43,720
Through finding a place in the game industry, I was able to start on a path of wondering

462
00:30:43,720 --> 00:30:47,083
what else I might be able to do that I didn't think was possible.

463
00:30:47,083 --> 00:30:50,906
Just being here is a pretty big one.

464
00:30:51,408 --> 00:30:56,431
Employment, or the right employment, can have such a positive impact on a person's life,

465
00:30:56,431 --> 00:31:03,134
but it's unfortunately something that's just inaccessible to most autistic people.

466
00:31:03,134 --> 00:31:07,616
I would really love for as many people to be able to find their own place,

467
00:31:07,616 --> 00:31:11,338
and I hope that the games industry can be one of those places for more people.

468
00:31:14,334 --> 00:31:18,759
So if you would also like to try and help make a place for autistic people,

469
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:22,364
I have a few really simple points that anyone can think about.

470
00:31:22,364 --> 00:31:26,990
Patience and awareness.

471
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:32,137
A big struggle for me on a daily basis is being perceived as rude when I don't mean to be.

472
00:31:33,140 --> 00:31:38,001
I find that a lot of people don't ever actually examine social conventions, and one thing

473
00:31:38,001 --> 00:31:43,203
you can do is ask yourself why you think something is rude and whether it's possible to interpret

474
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,904
it differently.

475
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:49,885
And it's okay if the answer is no, it's just a good habit to examine these things.

476
00:31:49,885 --> 00:31:51,906
So a simple example is eye contact.

477
00:31:51,906 --> 00:31:55,187
Does a person need to be looking at me to listen and understand?

478
00:31:55,187 --> 00:31:59,228
And why does staring make me uncomfortable?

479
00:31:59,228 --> 00:32:01,049
Is it from ascribing a meaning to it?

480
00:32:01,824 --> 00:32:03,765
Can it be done accidentally?

481
00:32:03,765 --> 00:32:08,908
And does that change how you feel?

482
00:32:08,908 --> 00:32:11,490
Don't assume needs.

483
00:32:11,490 --> 00:32:14,571
You'll hear it a million times, but every autistic person is different.

484
00:32:14,571 --> 00:32:18,914
Ask what specific adjustments would help an individual,

485
00:32:18,914 --> 00:32:20,615
and don't assume what an

486
00:32:20,615 --> 00:32:23,297
autistic person is and isn't capable of.

487
00:32:25,840 --> 00:32:27,841
Don't assume what's obvious.

488
00:32:27,841 --> 00:32:30,582
Things like unwritten rules.

489
00:32:30,582 --> 00:32:33,663
I find it really difficult to intuit what's expected of me.

490
00:32:33,663 --> 00:32:36,164
If something needs to be done, then say it.

491
00:32:36,164 --> 00:32:39,466
And if something needs to be done in a certain way,

492
00:32:39,466 --> 00:32:40,366
explain that.

493
00:32:40,366 --> 00:32:43,327
And if you want to be genuinely helpful, explain why.

494
00:32:43,327 --> 00:32:48,009
Understanding for everyone.

495
00:32:48,794 --> 00:32:51,857
Not everyone is open about being autistic.

496
00:32:51,857 --> 00:32:56,903
Most people at some point in their lives will have met someone who is autistic without even realizing.

497
00:32:56,903 --> 00:33:03,051
And having more patience and awareness for people in general can go a long way.

498
00:33:03,051 --> 00:33:07,676
Thank you for listening.

499
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,941
Up next we have Alana Linnaire.

00:33:31,053 --> 00:33:36,576
Hello everyone, I am Alana, rhymes with banana if you have an American accent, if you don't, it does not.

501
00:33:36,576 --> 00:33:43,880
And my pronouns are she, her, and I am the lead dev and founder of Toad House Games and Team Toad House.

502
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:47,882
Toad House Games is a visual novel indie game studio.

503
00:33:47,882 --> 00:33:50,084
Let me just set myself up here one second please, thank you.

504
00:33:51,339 --> 00:33:56,384
We're making Call Me Sarah. Sarah is C-E-R-A. It is wish-listable. Hint, hint.

505
00:33:56,384 --> 00:34:03,693
It's about making friends as an adult and it touches on therapy tools that are useful for people who don't have access to therapy.

506
00:34:03,693 --> 00:34:06,997
I'm also the person... give me a second, I'm pregnant and talking is hard.

507
00:34:09,203 --> 00:34:14,506
Okay. I'm also the person who organized the Palestinian itch

508
00:34:14,506 --> 00:34:16,527
bundle last year that made almost a million dollars

509
00:34:16,527 --> 00:34:18,208
for Palestinian aid.

510
00:34:18,208 --> 00:34:20,990
So although I organized it, thank you to all of you.

511
00:34:20,990 --> 00:34:23,491
I'd like to take a minute just to thank you,

512
00:34:23,491 --> 00:34:26,173
because without you it wouldn't have been as successful.

513
00:34:26,173 --> 00:34:27,713
So thank you to everyone who donated,

514
00:34:27,713 --> 00:34:29,795
volunteered, participated.

515
00:34:29,795 --> 00:34:31,776
I organized it, but you made it possible.

516
00:34:31,776 --> 00:34:32,356
So thank you.

517
00:34:32,356 --> 00:34:34,157
Round of applause for yourselves, please.

518
00:34:38,580 --> 00:34:44,931
Today I'd love to chat about writing neurodivergent characters and stories for neurodivergent gamers.

519
00:34:45,544 --> 00:34:50,067
So neurodivergent is the term when someone's brain processes,

520
00:34:50,067 --> 00:34:52,388
learns, and or behaves differently

521
00:34:52,388 --> 00:34:53,489
from what is considered typical.

522
00:34:53,489 --> 00:34:55,130
Once seen as a problem,

523
00:34:55,130 --> 00:34:58,352
neurodiversity now recognizes the human population is diverse

524
00:34:58,352 --> 00:34:59,953
and brain behaviors that deviate

525
00:34:59,953 --> 00:35:02,714
from the typical can be beneficial, as many people

526
00:35:02,714 --> 00:35:03,835
on this panel have highlighted.

527
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:05,916
Although not magical.

528
00:35:05,916 --> 00:35:08,437
So be careful, you're not like thinking, for example,

529
00:35:08,437 --> 00:35:11,399
Rain Man, that movie, or there's many examples of magical,

530
00:35:11,399 --> 00:35:12,280
they're magical beings.

531
00:35:12,841 --> 00:35:15,383
Of course they're creative, they've got bipolar disorder.

532
00:35:15,383 --> 00:35:16,424
Not like that.

533
00:35:16,424 --> 00:35:17,505
Beneficial, not magical.

534
00:35:17,505 --> 00:35:21,690
It does include things like autism, ADHD, and dyslexia.

535
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:23,592
It isn't limited to mental illness.

536
00:35:23,592 --> 00:35:25,093
So neurodivergent is a big umbrella,

537
00:35:25,093 --> 00:35:29,138
mental illness is a smaller thing.

538
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:30,880
I focus a lot on mental illness,

539
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,601
but we do touch on neurodivergency.

540
00:35:33,510 --> 00:35:35,791
So that said, let me reintroduce myself.

541
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:37,972
I'm Alana Lanier, I'm the founder and lead dev

542
00:35:37,972 --> 00:35:39,533
at Toad House Games, and I write games

543
00:35:39,533 --> 00:35:42,314
for mentally ill and neurodivergent gamers.

544
00:35:42,314 --> 00:35:44,054
However, when you're writing about heavy topics,

545
00:35:44,054 --> 00:35:45,635
like I typically do, because visual novels

546
00:35:45,635 --> 00:35:47,636
are a great medium for that,

547
00:35:47,636 --> 00:35:49,616
you do have to write mindfully,

548
00:35:49,616 --> 00:35:51,257
or you can trigger your player.

549
00:35:51,257 --> 00:35:52,338
So, what is triggering?

550
00:35:52,338 --> 00:35:55,639
There is a slang term in our community

551
00:35:55,639 --> 00:35:57,680
that triggering is just getting really, really, really

552
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:58,540
angry about something.

553
00:35:58,540 --> 00:35:59,560
Oh, I'm so triggered.

554
00:36:00,025 --> 00:36:00,866
I hate it.

555
00:36:00,866 --> 00:36:03,928
But when I use the word trigger, I mean a medical term.

556
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:06,591
It can cause serious health consequences.

557
00:36:06,591 --> 00:36:11,314
It has nothing to do with being weak or too sensitive.

558
00:36:11,314 --> 00:36:14,137
So for example, I lost my dog.

559
00:36:14,137 --> 00:36:16,418
My dog was 18 years old, lived a very long life.

560
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:17,459
I got her when I was 12.

561
00:36:17,459 --> 00:36:17,980
I lost her.

562
00:36:17,980 --> 00:36:20,141
And two weeks...

563
00:36:20,462 --> 00:36:24,725
Later, I was streaming on Twitch this beautiful indie game called What Comes After.

564
00:36:24,725 --> 00:36:28,228
It takes place on a train, it's about the afterlife, are they dead, are they not?

565
00:36:28,228 --> 00:36:29,969
It's great, play it.

566
00:36:29,969 --> 00:36:34,873
But there's a dog on that train, and I would not have had a live audience to watch me mourn

567
00:36:34,873 --> 00:36:40,177
my dog if I had known that it had touched on dead pets.

568
00:36:40,177 --> 00:36:43,439
So trigger warnings and content warnings are useful.

569
00:36:44,260 --> 00:36:48,586
in aiding gamers who decide if a game is safe for them, particularly in that moment.

570
00:36:48,586 --> 00:36:52,412
It's not meant to make the world a soft place where we can't write about these things.

571
00:36:52,412 --> 00:36:56,497
It's about giving information to your gamers so that they can make the decision for themselves.

572
00:36:56,497 --> 00:37:00,183
I would have waited six months to play the game about the dead dog.

573
00:37:01,320 --> 00:37:05,043
So games used to really add to the stigma,

574
00:37:05,043 --> 00:37:06,104
if you think mental illness,

575
00:37:06,104 --> 00:37:09,746
horror games that take place in mental wards,

576
00:37:09,746 --> 00:37:10,867
you know, that type thing.

577
00:37:10,867 --> 00:37:12,088
So I'll be talking about those.

578
00:37:12,088 --> 00:37:13,428
I'm gonna highlight really quickly

579
00:37:13,428 --> 00:37:14,409
because I want to get to my point,

580
00:37:14,409 --> 00:37:15,109
we're running out of time.

581
00:37:15,109 --> 00:37:19,592
Three really great examples of narrative versions in gaming.

582
00:37:19,592 --> 00:37:22,014
So Celeste, there's breathing exercises built in,

583
00:37:22,014 --> 00:37:25,256
there's distinct challenge levels to match the player,

584
00:37:25,256 --> 00:37:27,258
and it accurately depicts a panic attack feeling

585
00:37:27,258 --> 00:37:29,239
to those who haven't experienced one before.

586
00:37:29,239 --> 00:37:29,939
Very useful.

587
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:34,942
Life is strange. Realistic themes and mental illness portrayed accurately.

588
00:37:34,942 --> 00:37:38,023
Characters are more than their illnesses, they're proper people.

589
00:37:38,023 --> 00:37:42,485
And there's a link in-game for health-seeking resources. Very useful.

590
00:37:42,485 --> 00:37:47,327
And Hellblade, Sasuna, accurately portrays what it's like to hear voices and experience psychosis.

591
00:37:47,587 --> 00:37:50,688
created with input from people who lived experiences of psychosis,

592
00:37:50,688 --> 00:37:55,229
and allows players to experience psychosis via sound design, environment, and puzzles.

593
00:37:55,229 --> 00:37:56,849
Amazing games, please play them.

594
00:37:56,849 --> 00:37:59,070
But what do they have in common?

595
00:37:59,070 --> 00:38:02,750
They allow neurotypical people, so not neurodivergent people,

596
00:38:02,750 --> 00:38:05,171
to experience what it's like to have mental illness.

597
00:38:05,171 --> 00:38:07,211
So if you already know what it's like to have mental illness,

598
00:38:07,211 --> 00:38:10,692
those games aren't really an escape for you, they're kind of just a reminder.

599
00:38:11,532 --> 00:38:14,414
These are important games and still should be made.

600
00:38:14,414 --> 00:38:17,076
However, they're not able to be played

601
00:38:17,076 --> 00:38:18,597
by many neurodivergent people.

602
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:20,078
Like, I can't play Hellblade.

603
00:38:20,078 --> 00:38:22,080
So, this is Nicole from Call Me Sarah.

604
00:38:22,080 --> 00:38:23,100
She's our therapist.

605
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,081
So, what do I do?

606
00:38:24,081 --> 00:38:26,303
That sounds great.

607
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:27,804
How do I do this?

608
00:38:27,804 --> 00:38:32,047
I have a couple of tips for someone who is trying

609
00:38:32,047 --> 00:38:36,990
to make games for neurodivergent people.

610
00:38:38,750 --> 00:38:40,811
So remember your fantasy, it's your North Star.

611
00:38:40,811 --> 00:38:43,952
I'm of the belief that video games are fantasy.

612
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:45,533
We have power fantasies, money fantasies,

613
00:38:45,533 --> 00:38:46,854
superhero fantasies.

614
00:38:46,854 --> 00:38:48,674
My fantasy for all of my games

615
00:38:48,674 --> 00:38:50,655
is feeling loved and accepted.

616
00:38:50,655 --> 00:38:52,376
So a lot of people don't feel that in real life,

617
00:38:52,376 --> 00:38:54,056
so I want them to escape their life,

618
00:38:54,056 --> 00:38:56,297
play my games, and feel loved and accepted.

619
00:38:56,297 --> 00:38:58,038
I sound emotional, I'm not emotional,

620
00:38:58,038 --> 00:38:59,699
I swear I'm just pregnant.

621
00:39:03,105 --> 00:39:06,828
Show examples of how to handle tricky situations.

622
00:39:06,828 --> 00:39:08,289
So for example, in Good Luck in Home Cooking,

623
00:39:08,289 --> 00:39:10,450
another game of ours, we have like vignettes

624
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:13,813
that take place in the Kongosaur universe.

625
00:39:13,813 --> 00:39:16,415
Amira self-harms and Kenta, another character,

626
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:17,836
immediately takes care of her needs

627
00:39:17,836 --> 00:39:19,077
and assures her she's safe with him.

628
00:39:19,137 --> 00:39:21,158
He basically sees it and goes up to her and goes,

629
00:39:21,158 --> 00:39:23,460
hey, saw that happen, didn't like it.

630
00:39:23,460 --> 00:39:25,502
I mean, you probably feel like garbage,

631
00:39:25,502 --> 00:39:26,863
so don't feel bad that it happened.

632
00:39:26,863 --> 00:39:28,604
I don't want you to feel bad that you self-harmed,

633
00:39:28,604 --> 00:39:30,666
but please, can we talk about it

634
00:39:30,666 --> 00:39:31,627
so maybe you don't do it again,

635
00:39:31,627 --> 00:39:34,569
because I'm your friend and this really concerned me.

636
00:39:34,569 --> 00:39:36,931
So not only does it give an example to people

637
00:39:36,931 --> 00:39:38,512
on how to handle the tricky situation

638
00:39:38,512 --> 00:39:40,154
if they see a friend self-harm,

639
00:39:40,154 --> 00:39:44,017
but I got a lot of emails from people going like,

640
00:39:44,017 --> 00:39:45,418
that's what I needed to hear.

641
00:39:45,418 --> 00:39:47,039
No one told me that in real life.

642
00:39:47,039 --> 00:39:48,000
I really needed to hear that.

643
00:39:48,616 --> 00:39:49,697
So it was lovely.

644
00:39:49,697 --> 00:39:52,058
Makes up for all the hate I get from doing the Palestinian

645
00:39:52,058 --> 00:39:52,318
Cryptom.

646
00:39:52,318 --> 00:39:52,918
List common triggers.

647
00:39:52,918 --> 00:39:56,580
So in the beginning of all our games,

648
00:39:56,580 --> 00:40:00,763
I list all the common triggers I can possibly

649
00:40:00,763 --> 00:40:02,624
imagine that happened in our games.

650
00:40:02,624 --> 00:40:05,285
Because it's ultimately up to us to ensure

651
00:40:05,285 --> 00:40:07,366
our own personal safety.

652
00:40:07,366 --> 00:40:09,387
So give your gamers all the information

653
00:40:09,387 --> 00:40:11,588
they need in order to make a good decision for themselves.

654
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:15,102
So write about the topics, write about the hard stuff.

655
00:40:15,102 --> 00:40:16,664
Go ahead, torture your characters.

656
00:40:16,664 --> 00:40:19,087
It doesn't matter, but tell your gamer

657
00:40:19,087 --> 00:40:21,269
so they can go, mm, Doki Doki Literature Club,

658
00:40:21,269 --> 00:40:22,530
maybe not for me.

659
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:27,922
Right mindfully, do we really need to see all the details or can we leave some of up to the

660
00:40:27,922 --> 00:40:31,923
imagination of our players? Does the character need to live through trauma in front of us or

661
00:40:31,923 --> 00:40:36,125
is the aftermath what's really important to our plot? That's going back to our North Star.

662
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:40,927
We have a vignette called Rule for Confidence. Sophia is a trans woman, she's one of the main

663
00:40:40,927 --> 00:40:45,269
characters in it. I made sure she was not misgendered the whole time. I made sure that

664
00:40:45,269 --> 00:40:47,710
we talked about how she felt about things, not...

665
00:40:48,170 --> 00:40:52,051
show the trauma because trans people were the demographic we were writing for.

666
00:40:52,051 --> 00:40:56,192
Why would we re-traumatize the people they live in? Why do that to your gamers?

667
00:40:56,192 --> 00:41:01,933
And remember your audience. Are you writing to educate those who know about neurodivergent,

668
00:41:01,933 --> 00:41:07,095
who don't know how neurodivergent feels? Or are you writing to make those with mental illness

669
00:41:07,095 --> 00:41:12,776
feel represented? So these are my key tips. And for those of you who aren't neurodivergent in the

670
00:41:12,776 --> 00:41:13,176
audience,

671
00:41:15,324 --> 00:41:15,844
How do you do it?

672
00:41:15,844 --> 00:41:18,366
Well, I have some tips for you too.

673
00:41:18,366 --> 00:41:20,247
Hire those with lived experience.

674
00:41:20,247 --> 00:41:22,028
Believe it or not, they're really good workers.

675
00:41:22,028 --> 00:41:25,371
Naturally brings a different point of view to the table,

676
00:41:25,371 --> 00:41:26,772
keeps hidden biases out of your games.

677
00:41:26,772 --> 00:41:29,033
And then there's also cultural consultants

678
00:41:29,033 --> 00:41:30,554
and sensitivity readers.

679
00:41:30,554 --> 00:41:32,736
So cultural consultants are people you interview

680
00:41:32,736 --> 00:41:35,457
as part of your writing research beforehand,

681
00:41:35,457 --> 00:41:37,499
and they're great for reaching out with questions.

682
00:41:37,499 --> 00:41:37,859
Really quick ones,

683
00:41:37,859 --> 00:41:40,361
but especially like during Good Looking Home Cooking,

684
00:41:40,361 --> 00:41:43,503
it was really handy to DM Osama every time.

685
00:41:43,983 --> 00:41:47,164
I was like, I'm not sure, coffee, is that actually allowed during Ramadan?

686
00:41:47,164 --> 00:41:50,885
And he would give me like the list of rules and it was really handy.

687
00:41:50,885 --> 00:41:55,186
And sensitivity readers, they read your game at different stages to make sure that things

688
00:41:55,186 --> 00:41:57,167
aren't that obvious to you or pointed out.

689
00:41:57,167 --> 00:42:00,828
And remember to make sure that they know their suggestions are extremely welcome.

690
00:42:00,828 --> 00:42:04,329
So for Good Luck in Home Cooking, we had a Korean translator who was also a sensitivity

691
00:42:04,329 --> 00:42:08,050
reader because Jessica texts her mom in Korean.

692
00:42:08,573 --> 00:42:13,736
And she was just making sure that the conversation sounded authentic to a Korean mom-daughter exchange.

693
00:42:13,736 --> 00:42:18,179
And she said, my texting app is blue and yellow. Can we do that? Because a lot of people use this app.

694
00:42:18,179 --> 00:42:22,842
So we made it blue and yellow, and it made the game better. So it's important to let them know suggestions are welcome.

695
00:42:23,432 --> 00:42:24,592
So here's my socials.

696
00:42:24,592 --> 00:42:26,533
I'm gonna go sit down,

697
00:42:26,533 --> 00:42:27,453
because I feel like passing out.

698
00:42:27,453 --> 00:42:31,535
Please call me Sarah, wishlisted on Steam.

699
00:42:31,535 --> 00:42:34,256
Toad House Games is our visual novel studio.

700
00:42:34,256 --> 00:42:35,756
Team Toad House is our fan club

701
00:42:35,756 --> 00:42:37,157
and everything else that we do.

702
00:42:37,157 --> 00:42:40,058
I'm Alana, and I would like to introduce Patrick,

703
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,619
who's remote, right?

704
00:42:41,619 --> 00:42:42,599
Great, enjoy.

705
00:42:44,671 --> 00:42:57,394
Thanks Alana. Hi, I'm Patrick. My pronouns are he him. I'm a UI artist and user experience designer based in Japan. I was diagnosed with ADHD and auditory processing disorder around the age of 10.

706
00:42:57,394 --> 00:43:10,978
I was going to start this presentation with an anecdote, something to convince you that although ADHD doesn't seem like a big deal because it's so common. It can affect work performance relationships and even employment status.

707
00:43:11,859 --> 00:43:15,901
But then the anecdote was just going to look something like this chart.

708
00:43:15,901 --> 00:43:22,225
There was going to be a prologue for context, too many details, and then I go down a rabbit hole to

709
00:43:22,225 --> 00:43:28,569
a related side story. I realize I get distracted, so I'm apologizing, and that's seven minutes,

710
00:43:28,569 --> 00:43:34,953
so we will not do that. Instead, we'll start with a simple agenda. I'll explain what ADHD looks like

711
00:43:34,953 --> 00:43:38,075
at work and how we can make things better together.

712
00:43:41,037 --> 00:43:48,783
People with ADHD have chemical imbalances in their brain that cause symptoms neurotypical people experience, but in hard mode.

713
00:43:48,783 --> 00:43:56,270
Symptoms vary based on nature and nurture, while gender, race, disability, and class can have a huge impact on how someone is treated.

714
00:43:56,270 --> 00:44:02,635
Everyone's ADHD is different, which is why I've asked other game devs with ADHD to review this talk.

715
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,198
For starters, these are some of my symptoms.

716
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:07,400
Inattention.

717
00:44:08,384 --> 00:44:12,628
Our nervous system is actually interest-based rather than importance-based.

718
00:44:12,628 --> 00:44:15,270
Really, anything that breaks consistency.

719
00:44:15,270 --> 00:44:19,795
Neurotypical people go into 30-minute Twitter rabbit holes a few times a day.

720
00:44:19,795 --> 00:44:26,121
ADHDers do this every 30 minutes and forget their job interviews and anniversary dates before breakfast.

721
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:29,725
Also, breakfast. We forget breakfast a lot.

722
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:32,267
We understand the work, but the context can disappear.

723
00:44:33,602 --> 00:44:37,545
Hyperactivity, I won't realize I'm tapping my foot

724
00:44:37,545 --> 00:44:40,927
during a meeting until someone gets mad about it.

725
00:44:40,927 --> 00:44:44,169
Impulsivity, what to eat, what to wear.

726
00:44:44,169 --> 00:44:46,651
I just acquired a rabbit farm in Nebraska.

727
00:44:46,651 --> 00:44:48,652
It varies depending on the day.

728
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:51,314
At work, this means I get excited by ideas

729
00:44:51,314 --> 00:44:53,416
and interrupt people in meetings,

730
00:44:53,416 --> 00:44:54,957
and then I apologize often.

731
00:44:56,477 --> 00:45:03,000
So far, these are common symptoms that probably fit your image of ADHD, but what kind of person

732
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:08,943
loves note-taking, proactively organizes, focuses like nothing else, and does well in group settings?

733
00:45:08,943 --> 00:45:14,305
All of these are actually coping mechanisms that I've had to learn over the years.

734
00:45:14,305 --> 00:45:17,827
They're examples of masking ADHD, like Jade talked about earlier.

735
00:45:18,824 --> 00:45:23,665
I have working memory issues, so if I can't keep up with my notes, I'm totally lost.

736
00:45:23,665 --> 00:45:28,947
I'm a proactive organizer because I get overwhelmed by a bunch of raw data without filters.

737
00:45:28,947 --> 00:45:34,168
I get into these hours-long flow states where I just forget about everything and it's another

738
00:45:34,168 --> 00:45:37,009
rabbit hole and hopefully I haven't forgotten about another job interview.

739
00:45:37,936 --> 00:45:40,158
I have difficulty reflecting internally.

740
00:45:40,158 --> 00:45:42,600
Lots of people benefit from a group brainstorm,

741
00:45:42,600 --> 00:45:44,801
but I don't even realize I need to brainstorm

742
00:45:44,801 --> 00:45:47,683
until it's too late.

743
00:45:47,683 --> 00:45:49,625
By comparison, solo projects

744
00:45:49,625 --> 00:45:51,446
also become difficult and boring.

745
00:45:51,446 --> 00:45:53,348
All that being said,

746
00:45:53,348 --> 00:45:55,770
please challenge your expectations

747
00:45:55,770 --> 00:45:57,871
of what ADHD coworkers are good at

748
00:45:57,871 --> 00:45:59,312
while understanding how much work

749
00:45:59,312 --> 00:46:01,494
it can take us to compensate.

750
00:46:01,494 --> 00:46:04,476
To remove barriers for people with ADHD,

751
00:46:04,476 --> 00:46:07,178
we need structure, consistency.

752
00:46:07,822 --> 00:46:13,824
and care. Structure, bear with me on this. I'm about to rehash a Fast Company article that you've

753
00:46:13,824 --> 00:46:17,966
definitely already read too many times, but this is important. Without structure,

754
00:46:17,966 --> 00:46:24,769
I am a hot pile of garbage. Let's try to keep meetings short. I fade around 40 minutes. If

755
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:31,011
you have to go long, have breaks with snacks. Have a clear agenda that's shared beforehand

756
00:46:31,011 --> 00:46:33,132
so we have time to prepare and freak out.

757
00:46:33,967 --> 00:46:40,912
I may take my own notes, but it's good for everyone to agree where meeting minutes will be stored and who's taking them.

758
00:46:40,912 --> 00:46:46,216
Give as much notice for meetings as possible and allow people to choose when they present.

759
00:46:46,216 --> 00:46:53,781
I have difficulty focusing when I'm thinking about what I want to say. It's better to share my work first so I can focus on note taking for the rest of the meeting.

760
00:46:53,781 --> 00:46:55,803
Consistency.

761
00:46:57,485 --> 00:46:57,785
Right here.

762
00:46:57,785 --> 00:47:00,366
If you need me to do something that's important,

763
00:47:00,366 --> 00:47:03,308
a physical reminder is my last line of defense

764
00:47:03,308 --> 00:47:04,249
against my ADHD.

765
00:47:04,249 --> 00:47:07,311
I like it when people give me an urgent task

766
00:47:07,311 --> 00:47:08,892
and have a post-it reminder to go with it,

767
00:47:08,892 --> 00:47:11,633
but please check with your ADHD coworkers.

768
00:47:11,633 --> 00:47:14,635
It can come off as super passive aggressive,

769
00:47:14,635 --> 00:47:17,117
like a post-it war with a roommate.

770
00:47:17,117 --> 00:47:20,499
If you're working remotely, send me a message.

771
00:47:20,499 --> 00:47:20,759
Not yet.

772
00:47:20,759 --> 00:47:23,661
If you're working remotely, send me a message

773
00:47:23,661 --> 00:47:25,101
after you add that JIRA ticket.

774
00:47:25,101 --> 00:47:26,342
It's like a digital post-it.

775
00:47:27,775 --> 00:47:32,877
Kanban boards like Trello are great visual tools to organize tons of information into bite-sized cards.

776
00:47:32,877 --> 00:47:41,800
A couple of notes here. When people go outside these systems, I lose tasks and forget them. So please use them.

777
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:45,841
Plenty of talented ADHDers find project management software overwhelming.

778
00:47:45,841 --> 00:47:50,562
Try not to make these systems a hiring requirement and be willing to train new hires.

779
00:47:51,988 --> 00:47:56,290
I structured my day into big blocks of time to enable flow states.

780
00:47:56,290 --> 00:47:59,531
Emily told me flow states are like beautiful jam sessions.

781
00:47:59,531 --> 00:48:04,254
Interruptions are like a record scratch that makes the beat almost unrecoverable.

782
00:48:04,254 --> 00:48:08,676
There's this thing called the switch cost effect, where even neurotypical people

783
00:48:08,676 --> 00:48:12,698
take 23 minutes to recover their focus after an interruption, as small

784
00:48:12,698 --> 00:48:14,078
as a random text message.

785
00:48:14,847 --> 00:48:22,995
Plan check-ins and meetings, encourage everyone to set up office hour availability, and don't push those boundaries unless it's an emergency.

786
00:48:22,995 --> 00:48:30,442
Care. Folks with ADHD do stuff that in our non-ADHD-friendly world can come across as rude.

787
00:48:30,442 --> 00:48:36,267
For example, I often don't make eye contact with people during conversations because I can get distracted by facial expressions.

788
00:48:36,987 --> 00:48:41,248
During meetings, I may work on an art task or a sketch.

789
00:48:41,248 --> 00:48:43,288
Doodling actually helps me focus on you.

790
00:48:43,288 --> 00:48:46,189
Think of it like spare processing capacity

791
00:48:46,189 --> 00:48:49,310
that if unused starts working on another task.

792
00:48:49,310 --> 00:48:51,390
I need to keep myself engaged with something

793
00:48:51,390 --> 00:48:54,891
or it'll take over every spare process.

794
00:48:54,891 --> 00:48:57,311
In the office, if I'm wearing headphones,

795
00:48:57,311 --> 00:48:58,712
yes, I am ignoring you.

796
00:48:58,712 --> 00:49:00,512
And no, it's not personal.

797
00:49:00,512 --> 00:49:03,032
Sometimes I'll even turn off messaging software.

798
00:49:03,032 --> 00:49:05,213
All of this is to help me get my work done.

799
00:49:06,417 --> 00:49:14,661
Speaking to managers here, many of us prefer to sit in quiet areas that aren't near an entrance or busy area for obvious reasons.

800
00:49:14,661 --> 00:49:27,207
And lastly, let's just say what we mean. Alyssa Sweetman told me how the anxiety of guessing intent in a workplace that's filled with jargon stressed her out every day.

801
00:49:27,207 --> 00:49:33,290
Bottom line, do your research and check in with your ADHD colleagues, as well as your neurotypical co-workers.

802
00:49:33,863 --> 00:49:40,847
Some may be keeping their ADHD to themselves, so it's important to remember that this is private medical information.

803
00:49:40,847 --> 00:49:44,490
I know I've had mine because I worry it'll keep me from getting hired somewhere.

804
00:49:44,490 --> 00:49:50,774
And giving this talk has been a pretty big milestone in accepting my ADHD. So thank you for listening.

805
00:49:50,774 --> 00:49:57,718
A special note to the people, a special thank you note to the people that offered me feedback on this talk and gave me permission to give them a shout out.

806
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:03,639
You can find me on Twitter at SheGagari and you can sign up to playtest the mobile RPG

807
00:50:03,639 --> 00:50:19,269
I'm working on called Cyborg Immortal through the website right there. Thanks a lot.

808
00:50:19,269 --> 00:50:23,371
And I'm going to pass it to Ezekiel. That is the wonderful Ezekiel who is next.

809
00:50:23,371 --> 00:50:24,332
I did not miss Q at all.

810
00:50:27,495 --> 00:50:27,955
Oh, right.

811
00:50:27,955 --> 00:50:28,496
Hello.

812
00:50:28,496 --> 00:50:30,777
I'm Ezekiel.

813
00:50:30,777 --> 00:50:34,159
I'm a game designer and a project lead

814
00:50:34,159 --> 00:50:37,641
from Norway that loves his wife, coffee, output logs,

815
00:50:37,641 --> 00:50:39,222
and his kids.

816
00:50:39,222 --> 00:50:42,524
I'm 35 years old, and I'm an Unreal Engine fanatic

817
00:50:42,524 --> 00:50:44,126
since the Unreal Development Kit in 2004.

818
00:50:44,126 --> 00:50:48,388
I'm the project lead on digitally adapted training,

819
00:50:48,388 --> 00:50:50,550
a collaboration with Norway's largest specialist hospital,

820
00:50:50,550 --> 00:50:54,232
and the founder of AECRE and Wise Urban Studios.

821
00:50:54,818 --> 00:50:58,501
We do rapid prototypes, consultancy, and also medical software.

822
00:50:58,501 --> 00:51:04,166
And today I will talk to you about the ethical responsibility of accessibility.

823
00:51:04,166 --> 00:51:06,268
So, oh, sorry.

824
00:51:06,268 --> 00:51:11,232
It all started with a friend of mine suffering a brain stroke in his 40s.

825
00:51:11,232 --> 00:51:16,696
His drive and iron will to rehabilitate made me look into the possibilities of games in brain trauma rehabilitation.

826
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,461
Back in 2019, I pitched an idea to the large specialist

827
00:51:20,461 --> 00:51:22,543
hospital here.

828
00:51:22,543 --> 00:51:25,324
My idea was to reinvent how we approach brain trauma

829
00:51:25,324 --> 00:51:29,127
rehabilitation and how we develop games for it.

830
00:51:29,127 --> 00:51:32,209
By developing a VR framework for accessibility that allowed us

831
00:51:32,209 --> 00:51:34,590
to tweak and adjust features for each individual patient

832
00:51:34,590 --> 00:51:37,152
to their specific needs, we managed

833
00:51:37,152 --> 00:51:39,233
to include patients that normally wouldn't be able

834
00:51:39,233 --> 00:51:41,055
to play games in rehabilitation.

835
00:51:42,453 --> 00:51:45,534
Traumatic brain injury and stroke patients often exhibit

836
00:51:45,534 --> 00:51:46,875
neurodiverse traits.

837
00:51:46,875 --> 00:51:50,117
They may have aphasia, lack of concentration, or disordered

838
00:51:50,117 --> 00:51:51,978
vision, loss of hearing.

839
00:51:51,978 --> 00:51:54,059
And for us to include everyone, we made several

840
00:51:54,059 --> 00:52:00,002
systems, some of which are quite normal in games today.

841
00:52:00,002 --> 00:52:04,064
So we created minigames based on the feedback from health

842
00:52:04,064 --> 00:52:06,665
care personnel and from patients using the

843
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:08,867
accessibility framework that we built.

844
00:52:10,583 --> 00:52:14,905
VR games and VR games, they see up to 200% increased

845
00:52:14,905 --> 00:52:16,105
engagement in training.

846
00:52:16,105 --> 00:52:17,166
So this is very important.

847
00:52:17,166 --> 00:52:22,808
And here are some of the systems that we did create

848
00:52:22,808 --> 00:52:24,568
for the project.

849
00:52:24,568 --> 00:52:29,090
We had individual VR control schemes like AutoGrab,

850
00:52:29,090 --> 00:52:30,230
HoldToGrab, ClickToGrab.

851
00:52:30,672 --> 00:52:34,097
in order to meet the mouse of people with paralysis.

852
00:52:34,097 --> 00:52:36,900
Games are also playable with one arm, and we can toggle a

853
00:52:36,900 --> 00:52:39,844
switch to convert the right controller into the left

854
00:52:39,844 --> 00:52:40,865
controller if needed.

855
00:52:40,865 --> 00:52:45,571
For visual adjustments, we had highlighted colors and

856
00:52:45,571 --> 00:52:48,735
gameplay and elements like high contrast and easy to read

857
00:52:48,735 --> 00:52:49,637
fonts with voiceover.

858
00:52:50,442 --> 00:52:56,604
after TBI or stroke, up to 30 to 40 percent of the people have impaired vision. And visibility,

859
00:52:56,604 --> 00:53:01,185
improving visibility and adding voiceover helped our users quickly identify important

860
00:53:01,185 --> 00:53:08,447
information. But also immersion is very important. We avoided artificial things like omnipresent

861
00:53:08,447 --> 00:53:14,208
voices. Rather everything comes from a natural source in the world. And this is more comfortable

862
00:53:14,208 --> 00:53:19,010
and is less disconcerting for people, especially those that struggle with attention.

863
00:53:20,217 --> 00:53:23,542
Another important element was creating a relaxing environment.

864
00:53:23,542 --> 00:53:29,351
We built our world with relaxing colors, a tropical island with a cozy beach, sunbeds,

865
00:53:29,351 --> 00:53:33,036
books, fruits, and other things you'd normally associate with relaxing.

866
00:53:33,036 --> 00:53:36,462
This was important for us to sell the illusion to our users.

867
00:53:38,772 --> 00:53:40,534
We also avoided having distracting colors

868
00:53:40,534 --> 00:53:41,835
and clutter in our world.

869
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:44,537
Finding a balance between believable and overwhelming

870
00:53:44,537 --> 00:53:47,399
can be challenging, but with the help of early workshops

871
00:53:47,399 --> 00:53:51,802
during development, we were able to strike a balance early.

872
00:53:51,802 --> 00:53:55,185
And the early hands-on experience with our user

873
00:53:55,185 --> 00:53:57,506
was paramount to achieving our goal.

874
00:53:57,506 --> 00:54:00,769
Cluttered and overwhelming worlds, loud sounds,

875
00:54:00,769 --> 00:54:03,651
flashy imagery, omnipresent sounds,

876
00:54:03,651 --> 00:54:05,452
and out-of-place elements can be very hard

877
00:54:05,452 --> 00:54:06,813
for neurodivergent users.

878
00:54:07,898 --> 00:54:10,300
The infamous 100% volume splash screen

879
00:54:10,300 --> 00:54:11,701
still haunts games to this day

880
00:54:11,701 --> 00:54:14,303
and can cause problems for a lot of players,

881
00:54:14,303 --> 00:54:16,104
especially those that are neurodivergent.

882
00:54:16,104 --> 00:54:19,686
Some are even exhausted before they start to play the game.

883
00:54:19,686 --> 00:54:20,366
This is not good.

884
00:54:20,366 --> 00:54:24,789
We have to think diversely about our games

885
00:54:24,789 --> 00:54:27,651
and adding features that help neurodiverse players

886
00:54:27,651 --> 00:54:30,513
in any games, not just applied games, is very important.

887
00:54:30,513 --> 00:54:34,596
I encourage everyone here to think about accessibility

888
00:54:34,596 --> 00:54:34,716
to a

889
00:54:36,167 --> 00:54:41,588
neurodiverse scope, not just the normal scope of accessibility.

890
00:54:41,588 --> 00:54:46,090
After all, there is 1.2 billion people that are neurodivergent.

891
00:54:46,090 --> 00:54:50,671
So, why is this an ethical issue and why should you care?

892
00:54:50,671 --> 00:54:56,552
Well, the lack of diverse accessibility features in games

893
00:54:56,552 --> 00:55:00,313
isn't just a gameplay issue, it is an ethical issue. It excludes

894
00:55:00,313 --> 00:55:04,434
people from partaking in an activity that brings all layers of society together.

895
00:55:05,547 --> 00:55:07,487
Not only in applied games, but in all games.

896
00:55:07,487 --> 00:55:10,968
While we still face challenges with internet connectivity

897
00:55:10,968 --> 00:55:13,888
and hardware quality, games has the potential

898
00:55:13,888 --> 00:55:16,989
to be the place where you can socialize as equals,

899
00:55:16,989 --> 00:55:18,909
where social constructs and barriers

900
00:55:18,909 --> 00:55:20,109
doesn't have to hinder us.

901
00:55:20,109 --> 00:55:23,290
If we want a diverse and understanding tomorrow,

902
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:24,530
we need to experience each other

903
00:55:24,530 --> 00:55:26,450
without limitations and prejudice.

904
00:55:26,450 --> 00:55:29,911
This will be even more important as the metaverse,

905
00:55:29,911 --> 00:55:32,632
whatever shape or form that will take, becomes reality.

906
00:55:34,190 --> 00:55:37,692
So, I ask of you, everyone here today,

907
00:55:37,692 --> 00:55:40,474
help the world become a better tomorrow

908
00:55:40,474 --> 00:55:42,836
by thinking diversly about accessibility,

909
00:55:42,836 --> 00:55:45,277
and please do not leave any gamer behind.

910
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:46,598
Thank you, I'm Sikil.

911
00:55:46,598 --> 00:55:46,919
Thank you.

912
00:55:46,919 --> 00:55:47,099
Thank you.

913
00:55:47,099 --> 00:55:50,801
