1
00:00:05,489 --> 00:00:06,689
Okay, so hello everybody.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:09,111
By some kind of quirk of logistics,

3
00:00:09,292 --> 00:00:10,993
I'm next door to one of my colleagues

4
00:00:11,193 --> 00:00:12,114
who just got a cheer.

5
00:00:12,875 --> 00:00:15,257
I'm not happy about this. I'm starting to feel a little insecure.

6
00:00:15,297 --> 00:00:17,158
So if you don't mind, just kind of cheer now. Here we go.

7
00:00:17,959 --> 00:00:19,620
Woo!

8
00:00:20,561 --> 00:00:20,941
Yes!

9
00:00:21,402 --> 00:00:22,042
Eat that, Connor!

10
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:41,652
All right, just a few kind of housekeeping tasks. Please turn off or silent your mobile phones. I'm going to be in the wrap up room after this. Inevitably, I talk far too much. You'll find this as there probably won't be time for questions, but just come to the stage. We'll walk to our room 2022 afterwards and we can discuss.

11
00:00:45,075 --> 00:00:46,175
Please make sure you do review.

12
00:00:46,695 --> 00:00:49,816
Convert your kind of euphoric bliss of this talk into five stars.

13
00:00:50,297 --> 00:00:52,817
Or if euphoric bliss is a four star thing for you, please do that as well.

14
00:00:53,798 --> 00:00:58,379
So first of all, I am David Osborne, lead designer at Jagex.

15
00:00:58,419 --> 00:01:00,179
And Jagex are makers of this.

16
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,100
So we make RuneScape, which is a PC browser MMO.

17
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,181
It's been around for 15 years, which is astonishing.

18
00:01:07,221 --> 00:01:07,861
Go RuneScape.

19
00:01:08,661 --> 00:01:11,842
I've been there for 10 years, various kind of roles, but I'm

20
00:01:11,862 --> 00:01:13,082
currently lead designer.

21
00:01:13,623 --> 00:01:15,763
So first of all, I want to just reassure you that just

22
00:01:15,783 --> 00:01:18,844
because we are a 15-year MMO, we've engaged a long-term

23
00:01:18,864 --> 00:01:21,284
player base, doesn't mean that this talk will be an outlier,

24
00:01:21,344 --> 00:01:22,905
or it, as an example, is an outlier.

25
00:01:24,505 --> 00:01:24,985
Two of them.

26
00:01:27,774 --> 00:01:29,735
I won't get you guys doing that, don't worry.

27
00:01:29,755 --> 00:01:32,837
So it's not an outlier, this talk has been crafted just so it's just as applicable

28
00:01:33,337 --> 00:01:37,179
for an MMO, to a mobile game, to a board game, and why not local politics as well.

29
00:01:37,794 --> 00:01:39,714
I've got delusions of grandeur for this talk.

30
00:01:40,695 --> 00:01:44,216
The only things, so the worst parts of most talks is the background.

31
00:01:45,017 --> 00:01:48,058
Just to let you know that the only thing that's worth or needed to know

32
00:01:48,338 --> 00:01:50,359
is that we have two branches of our game.

33
00:01:50,419 --> 00:01:52,260
One is RuneScape main game, it's been around for 15 years.

34
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:55,581
The other is old school, which is kind of a snapshot of our game from 2007.

35
00:01:55,621 --> 00:01:59,523
This is for those people who saw it as our heyday or our golden era.

36
00:01:59,883 --> 00:02:01,124
And so people can play this game

37
00:02:03,445 --> 00:02:04,726
and I will talk about it in a moment,

38
00:02:04,746 --> 00:02:06,806
about how they poll and the interesting things we do about polling.

39
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:32,625
I first will say tells from a crowdsource game design. It was pointed out to me that maybe people might miss miss hear that almost read that to be crowdsourcing the game content. I'm not not not medium molecule so that will be not be in the talk. This is all about relinquishing your design control and handing it to the players. What happens the various pitfalls the various mountains of success. You'll climb as you do that and I'm going to talk about various ways that we have tried to relinquish design control.

40
00:02:33,869 --> 00:02:36,991
This is the talk that I really hoped was around three years ago.

41
00:02:37,311 --> 00:02:38,351
We've been doing this for three years,

42
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:41,973
and I really wish this talk was around to kind of inform us.

43
00:02:42,433 --> 00:02:42,733
Okay.

44
00:02:43,854 --> 00:02:45,055
This is a really daunting slide.

45
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:47,916
This is various examples of things that we have done

46
00:02:48,276 --> 00:02:49,957
to get the players involved in game design.

47
00:02:49,977 --> 00:02:51,338
I'm not going to talk about all of these.

48
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:52,818
As I said, this is just 25 minutes.

49
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,979
But you can see those kind of moving down

50
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,401
in terms of how much design control we're relinquishing to our play base.

51
00:02:57,801 --> 00:03:00,282
You likely do a number of these yourselves involving player feedback.

52
00:03:01,082 --> 00:03:02,563
What I really want to talk about is these three.

53
00:03:03,344 --> 00:03:09,590
The first one, publishing design documents, is about what happens when you bring the players into your design feedback stage.

54
00:03:10,130 --> 00:03:15,115
Commission 11 Polls is about what happens when you bring your players into the design decision-making stage.

55
00:03:15,516 --> 00:03:21,081
And RuneLabs is about what happens when you fully hand over your design and give the design to the players.

56
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:23,183
They're able to create their own designs and put it into the game.

57
00:03:25,086 --> 00:03:28,407
OK, so as I mentioned, we have two splinters of the game,

58
00:03:28,608 --> 00:03:29,568
Old School and RuneScape.

59
00:03:29,968 --> 00:03:31,789
Old School does exhaustive polling.

60
00:03:32,209 --> 00:03:35,711
This is kind of the constitution between the

61
00:03:35,731 --> 00:03:38,232
developers and the players, that nothing will go into the

62
00:03:38,272 --> 00:03:41,693
game, no feedback even, no substantive content will go

63
00:03:41,733 --> 00:03:43,434
into the game without the player say so.

64
00:03:43,794 --> 00:03:44,715
Everything is polled.

65
00:03:45,335 --> 00:03:47,896
So with us, 75% is required for content to go into the

66
00:03:47,916 --> 00:03:48,036
game.

67
00:03:51,798 --> 00:03:53,639
We even polled it, whether or not we wanted to reduce that to 70%.

68
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:56,841
Our players said no, and 40% of people said yes.

69
00:03:58,261 --> 00:03:59,982
This generates a pool of content to go into the game,

70
00:04:00,022 --> 00:04:01,683
and once that pool is kind of depleted,

71
00:04:01,883 --> 00:04:03,024
then we continue the cycle again,

72
00:04:03,344 --> 00:04:04,625
creating more content that will go into the game.

73
00:04:04,865 --> 00:04:07,427
What this does is it creates a defensive stockade around your game.

74
00:04:07,447 --> 00:04:09,508
It casts the players as protectors.

75
00:04:12,026 --> 00:04:13,767
The other poll system we use is for our RuneScape game.

76
00:04:14,407 --> 00:04:15,787
And this is occasional polling.

77
00:04:16,627 --> 00:04:18,208
What this is, is more of an engagement tool.

78
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,389
We target those projects that are best suited to polling,

79
00:04:21,589 --> 00:04:23,230
and having that kind of spotlight thrown on it,

80
00:04:24,070 --> 00:04:26,071
bringing it the attention that polling gives it.

81
00:04:26,811 --> 00:04:28,511
We don't have a 75% majority here.

82
00:04:28,571 --> 00:04:31,953
It's kind of a tool that we can use to dictate the kind of make-up of the content,

83
00:04:32,353 --> 00:04:33,813
or do some commission-level stuff.

84
00:04:35,254 --> 00:04:36,654
Okay. So just to cover that,

85
00:04:36,674 --> 00:04:39,015
it's also the polling, cost players as protectors, occasional polling,

86
00:04:39,035 --> 00:04:41,496
more of an engagement tool that builds investment in the content.

87
00:04:42,559 --> 00:04:46,981
So each of these, just in case you are interested in trying these with your games or your upcoming game,

88
00:04:47,001 --> 00:04:48,841
I'm just going to go over some good practice first.

89
00:04:50,122 --> 00:04:55,063
And a good practice that I would recommend is definitely put your poll system in game.

90
00:04:56,324 --> 00:05:00,485
Your poll content, if it's good, is going to be creating content, it's going to be changing content.

91
00:05:00,785 --> 00:05:04,847
You need to bring it to your players who are exploring and are taking part in that content.

92
00:05:05,267 --> 00:05:07,608
Otherwise, you're going to be putting it out on social media, on your website,

93
00:05:07,768 --> 00:05:11,189
and only engaging with those who are most socially mobile, most socially engaged.

94
00:05:12,442 --> 00:05:14,366
And plus, the majority of your players are likely in-game anyway.

95
00:05:14,386 --> 00:05:15,589
At least I hope they're playing your game.

96
00:05:16,291 --> 00:05:17,634
Show visible real-time results.

97
00:05:18,015 --> 00:05:20,360
So this is obviously something that polling doesn't necessarily do much.

98
00:05:21,476 --> 00:05:26,439
But there is nothing more mobilizing in terms of polling than a visible poll.

99
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:29,961
If it is close, if a poll is close and two options are close together,

100
00:05:30,762 --> 00:05:32,143
nothing mobilizes the player base more.

101
00:05:32,803 --> 00:05:33,884
Allow a change of mind.

102
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:37,026
If players are aware that they can change their mind at any point,

103
00:05:37,506 --> 00:05:38,587
they're going to talk to each other.

104
00:05:38,607 --> 00:05:40,628
They're going to try to change each other's mind.

105
00:05:40,808 --> 00:05:42,830
The chatter will increase, the conversation will increase.

106
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:46,438
And we like to understand what loads a question.

107
00:05:46,999 --> 00:05:49,441
Players will know that we are trying,

108
00:05:49,561 --> 00:05:52,324
they will assume that we are trying to load a question.

109
00:05:53,325 --> 00:05:55,366
And we know that reward does that more than anything else.

110
00:05:55,707 --> 00:05:58,069
If one option promises a reward while another one doesn't,

111
00:05:58,549 --> 00:06:00,010
they will assume that that second option

112
00:06:00,030 --> 00:06:00,891
doesn't come with a reward,

113
00:06:00,971 --> 00:06:02,413
they're better off voting for the first.

114
00:06:02,753 --> 00:06:04,074
Always understand what motivates a player,

115
00:06:04,094 --> 00:06:06,056
and that's most often their own self-interest.

116
00:06:07,603 --> 00:06:09,324
Brevity is another good one.

117
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,747
So if you can summarize something in a few words,

118
00:06:11,787 --> 00:06:13,989
an elevator pitch, that will always win out with something

119
00:06:14,029 --> 00:06:15,771
that has to be partnered with a design document.

120
00:06:16,051 --> 00:06:17,572
Understand what brevity does to your poll.

121
00:06:18,113 --> 00:06:20,495
We've also come to terms with player demographics.

122
00:06:22,057 --> 00:06:24,259
With our poll system, if we are polling a combat update

123
00:06:24,299 --> 00:06:26,321
against the quest update, we start hitting problems.

124
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:32,022
Our quest group, our quest demographic, is a minority in comparison to combat.

125
00:06:32,042 --> 00:06:32,902
It doesn't have enough people.

126
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:38,145
So, every time we poll, a combat option will always win over a story option.

127
00:06:39,165 --> 00:06:41,807
We've learnt not to play player types against each other.

128
00:06:42,507 --> 00:06:45,889
Instead, we have something like a combat poll, we have a story poll, and those two never meet.

129
00:06:48,030 --> 00:06:50,371
Okay, so what flaws have we seen from polls?

130
00:06:51,650 --> 00:06:56,632
God forbid the moment you actually put something to the game that is negative or controversial that was not polled.

131
00:06:57,512 --> 00:07:01,434
The immediate reaction you will receive is this should have been polled. We could have stopped this.

132
00:07:01,894 --> 00:07:03,675
We would have protected the game. What are you doing?

133
00:07:04,395 --> 00:07:06,796
You start hearing that repeatedly. It starts getting quite stark.

134
00:07:07,772 --> 00:07:13,078
But the problem with that is players do not instinctively value or understand everything that goes into your game.

135
00:07:13,879 --> 00:07:17,383
They do not necessarily value your tutorial or your final experience.

136
00:07:17,783 --> 00:07:23,810
They do not necessarily value the increasing price of items, the need for gold sinks perhaps.

137
00:07:25,152 --> 00:07:27,454
They don't value your kind of monetization strategies.

138
00:07:28,977 --> 00:07:37,283
This is something that might be critical and a deal breaker when it comes to putting poll systems into your game and allowing players to have input on your decision making process.

139
00:07:37,644 --> 00:07:39,545
The way we've dealt with it is education.

140
00:07:40,606 --> 00:07:43,468
Kind of treated our players as adults and brought them in.

141
00:07:44,488 --> 00:07:50,973
So we bring in kind of influencers, we talk to them first, we put out dev blogs beforehand, before a poll goes live.

142
00:07:51,233 --> 00:07:55,316
We try to talk about what is important to a player, frame it in what is important to a player.

143
00:07:56,504 --> 00:07:59,809
If more people are coming into the game, that's more people to play with in their multiplayer content.

144
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:04,115
If we've got a good funnel, then their friends are more likely to stick around and play with them.

145
00:08:05,457 --> 00:08:08,441
If there's monetization, then it's likely the game will last longer.

146
00:08:09,741 --> 00:08:12,203
There are also small details here that polls are also relatively expensive.

147
00:08:13,124 --> 00:08:14,545
A poll will have to finish, so you've got to,

148
00:08:14,805 --> 00:08:17,287
best, I would say, roughly two weeks is good for a poll to finish.

149
00:08:17,308 --> 00:08:19,169
You've got to build that into your process.

150
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:22,952
And also, it may be that your team will perceive a reduction in creativity

151
00:08:23,012 --> 00:08:24,994
by handing decision-making to the players.

152
00:08:25,475 --> 00:08:28,217
I always argue this because as long as the team

153
00:08:28,377 --> 00:08:30,179
is happy with every single option in a poll,

154
00:08:30,359 --> 00:08:31,280
and they definitely should be,

155
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,022
then there is no reduction in creativity.

156
00:08:34,082 --> 00:08:34,923
Every option is a goer.

157
00:08:37,017 --> 00:08:38,540
And the poll benefits for us have been huge.

158
00:08:39,341 --> 00:08:42,506
Instead of that kind of sine wave of discussion,

159
00:08:43,508 --> 00:08:45,471
when it comes to our content where something is released...

160
00:08:46,752 --> 00:08:49,354
People are talking, but then that talking just kind of breaks off,

161
00:08:49,814 --> 00:08:50,875
no longer over the course of the week.

162
00:08:51,075 --> 00:08:53,096
Instead, we get that kind of long periods of chatter.

163
00:08:53,477 --> 00:08:56,219
They're discussing what each option might mean.

164
00:08:56,419 --> 00:08:58,881
They're speculating about what it will be like in the game.

165
00:08:59,301 --> 00:09:00,542
They're trying to mobilize each other.

166
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:02,623
They're trying to push people to other options.

167
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:04,665
They're champions of individual options.

168
00:09:04,985 --> 00:09:07,447
We've even got people talking about democratic process.

169
00:09:07,467 --> 00:09:10,449
You know, people lording first-past-the-post systems.

170
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,350
It's bizarre.

171
00:09:13,111 --> 00:09:14,813
And what you see is this increased retention.

172
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:16,520
because of it.

173
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:18,741
They want to stick around to see this content

174
00:09:18,761 --> 00:09:19,261
that they've pulled.

175
00:09:19,281 --> 00:09:20,422
They want to see what it's going to be like

176
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:21,242
when it's realized.

177
00:09:21,623 --> 00:09:24,664
We see a spike in kind of active users on launch.

178
00:09:25,725 --> 00:09:27,546
As players, I guess it's that mentality

179
00:09:27,586 --> 00:09:29,347
of you've read a book, you want to see the movie.

180
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:31,408
You've kind of seen the part, you've seen the poll,

181
00:09:31,468 --> 00:09:32,508
what's it going to be like when it's come out?

182
00:09:33,929 --> 00:09:35,650
And we're starting to see some cultural changes.

183
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,631
Players are becoming, are seeing themselves as protectors.

184
00:09:38,952 --> 00:09:40,793
They're on the wall, kind of making sure

185
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:44,154
there are no wholesale game devaluing changes.

186
00:09:45,082 --> 00:09:48,323
And they're there with their friends. They want to bring their friends onto that wall to protect the game too.

187
00:09:48,343 --> 00:09:50,485
And they're worried about ever leaving the wall.

188
00:09:50,985 --> 00:09:53,746
If they do, then the White Walkers are just going to storm in and ruin everything.

189
00:09:55,327 --> 00:09:58,049
Players feel safer, and there's a lot of value to be put in that.

190
00:09:58,729 --> 00:10:01,451
Often there is this kind of inherent fear, or background fear,

191
00:10:01,731 --> 00:10:04,553
that a game could change, the carpet could be pulled from underneath them at any point.

192
00:10:05,113 --> 00:10:07,414
As protectors, they know that that will not happen.

193
00:10:07,974 --> 00:10:09,215
And that kind of makes them feel freer.

194
00:10:11,085 --> 00:10:13,869
My greatest benefit from polling is that players were more aware of each other.

195
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:16,534
Beforehand, it was very common to see players saying,

196
00:10:16,554 --> 00:10:19,599
we don't want this, we don't want this update, what are you doing?

197
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,023
I've talked to all my friends, none of the players want this.

198
00:10:23,597 --> 00:10:27,038
What he's starting to see is that they were reinforced by their own social cabals.

199
00:10:27,578 --> 00:10:30,079
They were talking to each other, there was lots of like-minded people in those cabals.

200
00:10:30,699 --> 00:10:34,021
And they were just reinforced that, hey, this is the opinion of the entire game.

201
00:10:34,401 --> 00:10:36,862
And when they come to the Pulse system, they realize that is not true.

202
00:10:37,202 --> 00:10:40,964
They're now aware of different player types. They're aware of Bartle, even, which is great.

203
00:10:41,764 --> 00:10:46,046
And obviously, they're kind of brought the developers and the players closer together.

204
00:10:46,066 --> 00:10:49,407
We're not in our ivory tower, making arbitrary decisions.

205
00:10:51,686 --> 00:10:54,688
So if you're thinking about bringing the players into your decision-making process,

206
00:10:54,768 --> 00:10:55,589
understand that tension.

207
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:58,391
The players will want to vote on everything, absolutely everything,

208
00:10:58,591 --> 00:10:59,752
but they do not value everything.

209
00:11:00,873 --> 00:11:03,315
And there are things that will benefit the long term of your game

210
00:11:03,335 --> 00:11:06,197
that you'll want to do, but your players will say no to.

211
00:11:07,979 --> 00:11:09,360
So understand how you're going to achieve that.

212
00:11:09,380 --> 00:11:11,502
It might be through education, it might be through a constitution

213
00:11:11,522 --> 00:11:13,443
between you and the player that you're not going to poll everything.

214
00:11:14,624 --> 00:11:17,286
But with it comes that benefit, the strong engagement and retention

215
00:11:17,326 --> 00:11:18,587
and a cultural shift with your player base.

216
00:11:20,806 --> 00:11:24,107
Now the next kind of way of getting players involved in crowdsourcing your game design

217
00:11:24,408 --> 00:11:27,049
is getting them involved in feedback, the feedback stage.

218
00:11:27,569 --> 00:11:29,210
This one kind of came about by necessity.

219
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,451
We were polling something, and then seven, eight, or nine months on from that, they would

220
00:11:33,491 --> 00:11:34,412
get their game content.

221
00:11:34,952 --> 00:11:36,293
That's a huge amount of time.

222
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,994
I mean, I lose the plot of Sons of Anarchy between each episode.

223
00:11:39,014 --> 00:11:39,914
And that's weekly.

224
00:11:40,234 --> 00:11:43,536
You can't imagine somebody sticking around for nine months and remaining invested, because

225
00:11:43,556 --> 00:11:44,916
polls are an investment tool.

226
00:11:46,304 --> 00:11:49,305
So we tried various ways of kind of bringing them into the process, being more transparent.

227
00:11:49,845 --> 00:11:53,506
So dev blogs, things like that, but live streams.

228
00:11:53,526 --> 00:11:56,808
But really what we wanted to do was involve the player in the feedback process.

229
00:11:56,828 --> 00:11:59,748
And the best way of doing that, we found, was publishing our design documents.

230
00:12:00,209 --> 00:12:01,989
We would release a design document on one day.

231
00:12:02,169 --> 00:12:05,730
Over the course of the week, each day, we would post patch notes to that design document,

232
00:12:06,131 --> 00:12:08,892
reacting to the feedback, letting them know what we're incorporating.

233
00:12:09,352 --> 00:12:12,313
And then at the end of the week, we would re-release that design document.

234
00:12:12,993 --> 00:12:16,554
That design document would feel very different from the one we first put out.

235
00:12:18,335 --> 00:12:20,476
Now, obviously you know good design doc processes,

236
00:12:20,516 --> 00:12:23,037
but many of you are designers or developers.

237
00:12:24,037 --> 00:12:25,598
But when it comes to pushing one out to the players,

238
00:12:25,618 --> 00:12:26,778
there are a lot of things to keep in mind.

239
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:28,779
Please do choose your update wisely.

240
00:12:28,799 --> 00:12:30,600
You're going to find out very soon

241
00:12:30,980 --> 00:12:34,401
the cost of producing a design document for the players is huge.

242
00:12:35,452 --> 00:12:36,032
It's massive.

243
00:12:36,492 --> 00:12:37,953
So doing it for niche updates,

244
00:12:38,513 --> 00:12:39,794
you get disproportional success.

245
00:12:40,154 --> 00:12:40,955
It will not be worth it.

246
00:12:41,215 --> 00:12:43,456
So choose those updates that are broad, that are universal.

247
00:12:44,177 --> 00:12:46,318
And you have to be so hugely confident in your update.

248
00:12:47,199 --> 00:12:49,080
If you're putting out a design document that's shabby,

249
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,421
then your players will begin to feel

250
00:12:51,461 --> 00:12:52,282
that you just don't care,

251
00:12:52,302 --> 00:12:53,422
that you're just not putting in the effort.

252
00:12:54,423 --> 00:12:55,644
Be really confident in the update.

253
00:12:55,684 --> 00:12:58,926
Don't treat it, treat this design document as a beater.

254
00:12:59,466 --> 00:13:00,807
This should be the most finished design document

255
00:13:00,847 --> 00:13:01,727
you have ever put out.

256
00:13:02,168 --> 00:13:03,428
Everybody should have signed off on it.

257
00:13:05,026 --> 00:13:08,028
It would need to be kind of presented in the flow of user experience.

258
00:13:08,348 --> 00:13:11,770
Describe it in the way that the player interacts with your content.

259
00:13:12,711 --> 00:13:16,673
They will be moving through geographically, chronologically, through your content.

260
00:13:16,953 --> 00:13:19,515
Tell them the story of going through your content.

261
00:13:19,875 --> 00:13:21,656
This is the language of their game experience.

262
00:13:21,896 --> 00:13:24,338
So you're going to have to completely refactor your design document to that.

263
00:13:25,738 --> 00:13:26,259
Add reasoning.

264
00:13:27,051 --> 00:13:31,759
There's a lot of things in that design document that will feel strange without the context of your acceptance criteria.

265
00:13:32,099 --> 00:13:35,225
You've likely put those, already created your core aims or acceptance criteria anyway.

266
00:13:35,525 --> 00:13:39,452
Put them at the top, players will start to understand that your decision is not arbitrary.

267
00:13:39,973 --> 00:13:41,395
And also understand the level of detail.

268
00:13:42,607 --> 00:13:48,632
If you're putting in drop rates, XP rates, monetization details, 90% of your feedback

269
00:13:48,672 --> 00:13:50,734
will fixate on those details.

270
00:13:51,175 --> 00:13:54,798
It might be that one was overpowered or underpowered, or maybe there was an error.

271
00:13:55,499 --> 00:13:58,161
Understand that players will pick this apart and will not give you feedback on the rest

272
00:13:58,181 --> 00:13:58,362
of it.

273
00:13:58,442 --> 00:14:01,204
It might be that you want that, maybe you're so confident in the efficacy of the rest of

274
00:14:01,224 --> 00:14:01,665
your design.

275
00:14:02,565 --> 00:14:03,887
And really break it video and text.

276
00:14:04,187 --> 00:14:06,589
We didn't see any cannibalization between the different media.

277
00:14:06,749 --> 00:14:07,550
It means you get it out there.

278
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:13,077
So the flaws, it's a huge intensity of work.

279
00:14:13,197 --> 00:14:14,818
Putting together, doing the design process,

280
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:15,899
the published design process,

281
00:14:16,119 --> 00:14:18,261
was 120 hours of designer work.

282
00:14:19,842 --> 00:14:21,203
And understand that it delays development.

283
00:14:21,644 --> 00:14:24,366
Your design phase is going to swallow up

284
00:14:24,386 --> 00:14:25,707
probably another two weeks of work.

285
00:14:25,967 --> 00:14:26,547
Build that in.

286
00:14:27,148 --> 00:14:27,748
Maybe a cost.

287
00:14:28,349 --> 00:14:29,770
For many of you, you work agile.

288
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:31,812
Maybe you don't even do a design document.

289
00:14:32,432 --> 00:14:33,593
Maybe it's kind of iterative

290
00:14:33,613 --> 00:14:34,714
and created over the course of the design.

291
00:14:34,754 --> 00:14:36,115
Maybe your design document is more visual.

292
00:14:37,143 --> 00:14:38,824
This may be a deal breaker for you.

293
00:14:39,045 --> 00:14:42,907
If you don't put out longer, more text-oriented design documents,

294
00:14:42,927 --> 00:14:44,528
it may be that the work to convert it is too much.

295
00:14:45,348 --> 00:14:47,770
And there is a potential negative impact on your current content.

296
00:14:47,830 --> 00:14:49,671
Understand, if this is an ongoing game,

297
00:14:50,231 --> 00:14:52,933
that if you're putting out something, a design for something that improves on

298
00:14:53,894 --> 00:14:56,375
something existing in the game, they may not play that content anymore.

299
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,717
You may be manipulating your economy by putting this information out there.

300
00:15:00,017 --> 00:15:01,858
Understand the effect on your current game content.

301
00:15:03,326 --> 00:15:06,788
And do not expect wide ranging feedback from your player base.

302
00:15:07,848 --> 00:15:21,454
So players, as we've seen from the kind of the legions, the forum, the hundreds and thousands of forum posts and social media feedback that we received on our published design documents, is that players do not give creative feedback. They do not offer alternatives.

303
00:15:22,495 --> 00:15:24,075
They don't often not very constructive.

304
00:15:25,747 --> 00:15:27,187
But that's fine. We'll go into that in a minute.

305
00:15:27,387 --> 00:15:28,828
And they do not have a full deck of lenses.

306
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:31,768
They won't understand tutorialization,

307
00:15:32,029 --> 00:15:33,729
kind of narrative grounding.

308
00:15:33,749 --> 00:15:35,250
They won't understand a lot of these things.

309
00:15:35,470 --> 00:15:36,710
So understand what the players will give you.

310
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:41,191
But design.benefits, there's more participation than you'd think.

311
00:15:41,632 --> 00:15:44,112
For our Elf City design documents, which are the first ones we put out,

312
00:15:44,512 --> 00:15:47,333
one-third of our player base read those design documents.

313
00:15:48,033 --> 00:15:50,194
Fewer than one-third could actually play it on launch.

314
00:15:50,794 --> 00:15:51,875
Players were really interested in it.

315
00:15:51,895 --> 00:15:53,475
They really wanted to get involved with it.

316
00:15:54,304 --> 00:15:57,807
And while their feedback is limited to certain things, it is hugely valuable.

317
00:15:58,068 --> 00:16:02,131
It comes in the context of, I will play this, or I will not play this.

318
00:16:03,192 --> 00:16:07,236
While that is limited, that is ultimately what you're looking for from your content.

319
00:16:07,556 --> 00:16:10,299
You want to know if the people who are playing your game will play the game.

320
00:16:13,261 --> 00:16:17,165
And players have begun to understand, or get a better sense of the realistic kind of

321
00:16:17,485 --> 00:16:19,767
what happens when we're designing content or developing content.

322
00:16:20,678 --> 00:16:22,159
Content doesn't just appear in the game.

323
00:16:22,739 --> 00:16:25,681
They often felt like we just treated our community as a beta.

324
00:16:26,241 --> 00:16:27,822
That we would just throw content out there.

325
00:16:28,242 --> 00:16:30,724
And because they only saw nerfs or improvements,

326
00:16:31,324 --> 00:16:33,045
they believed that we just treated the whole of the game

327
00:16:33,305 --> 00:16:34,626
as a beta phase.

328
00:16:35,966 --> 00:16:38,108
Now understand how long it takes to create something.

329
00:16:38,408 --> 00:16:40,729
They have more belief and faith in us as designers.

330
00:16:41,450 --> 00:16:42,110
That's very valuable.

331
00:16:43,191 --> 00:16:44,932
And there's a huge change to release day.

332
00:16:44,972 --> 00:16:46,012
This is something we didn't expect.

333
00:16:46,032 --> 00:16:46,953
Release day is awesome.

334
00:16:48,296 --> 00:16:51,677
Players were often kind of on other content that didn't have design documents published.

335
00:16:51,817 --> 00:16:53,018
There was an expectation gap.

336
00:16:54,038 --> 00:16:55,518
They kind of, they got on the hype train

337
00:16:56,119 --> 00:16:57,739
and believed it to be something that it wasn't.

338
00:16:57,759 --> 00:16:59,480
They extrapolated far further.

339
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,480
And then when it was launched, there was kind of,

340
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:02,881
this isn't quite what I wanted.

341
00:17:03,481 --> 00:17:05,242
That thinned down, smaller gap.

342
00:17:05,802 --> 00:17:07,082
It reduced orientation. They don't need,

343
00:17:07,663 --> 00:17:09,763
fewer players need tutorialization or orientation.

344
00:17:09,783 --> 00:17:11,604
They're going straight to the content that they want to get to.

345
00:17:11,904 --> 00:17:13,184
Again, that's valuable to your player base.

346
00:17:14,070 --> 00:17:18,675
It's reduced the chance of post-launch issues, the number of times that we have put an update into our game

347
00:17:18,895 --> 00:17:23,900
that's been completely derailed by one thing that needs to be nerfed or powered up a little bit more.

348
00:17:25,364 --> 00:17:50,820
Some fix that has to be made and all the conversation again is fixated on that. It directs conversation where you want it. And in our case, and something that's very valuable, I would encourage you to try this is put is don't put everything in your design document. Try putting little Easter eggs into your content that players will search out on launch day and let them know that they're there so they can go find them. We found a kind of great great value in that, and that meant that not everything was kind of in that design document. There was still something to find.

349
00:17:52,508 --> 00:17:54,930
So takeaways, expensive and time consuming,

350
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:56,450
only suits a limited range of projects,

351
00:17:56,630 --> 00:17:59,071
but as a tool, it does throw a spotlight on your content,

352
00:17:59,312 --> 00:18:00,712
really does improve that relationship,

353
00:18:01,272 --> 00:18:03,553
and does make your release day kind of stress-free.

354
00:18:05,334 --> 00:18:06,335
Okay, so the next one.

355
00:18:06,435 --> 00:18:09,276
So what happens when you do a fully crowdsourced game design?

356
00:18:09,696 --> 00:18:11,557
We came up with something bespoke called RuneLabs.

357
00:18:11,577 --> 00:18:16,059
You can kind of see the process across the bottom there.

358
00:18:16,619 --> 00:18:18,340
And we were feeling the glow of the design documents.

359
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,761
The players loved the design documents.

360
00:18:20,757 --> 00:18:25,340
And we thought the natural extension was to bring them into making designs for our game.

361
00:18:25,901 --> 00:18:29,083
It also meant that we could kind of push through and talk to press.

362
00:18:29,423 --> 00:18:34,206
Press might be interested in a game that was designed by our players.

363
00:18:34,707 --> 00:18:38,069
So we start by players generating an idea and adding that to our database.

364
00:18:38,269 --> 00:18:39,570
We now have effectively a database.

365
00:18:40,691 --> 00:18:43,052
Players then upvote those designs that they really like.

366
00:18:43,653 --> 00:18:48,816
And then we take the top five, top four, top three, whatever we agreed for that month.

367
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:55,598
And those are then put in game as a poll people in game and choose the update. They want to go in.

368
00:18:56,938 --> 00:19:02,620
Is a little example of some of the ideas we got. I really don't know what 101 things to do with this thick of bamboo is. I probably don't want to know.

369
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:05,100
But what we do is.

370
00:19:06,381 --> 00:19:08,821
Once that winning option is chosen.

371
00:19:09,894 --> 00:19:13,416
The player is involved, they go to effectively sprint reviews,

372
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:14,717
they sign off on concepts,

373
00:19:15,557 --> 00:19:17,098
they're involved as much as we can do.

374
00:19:17,918 --> 00:19:20,600
And as long as their name isn't a My Little Pony reference,

375
00:19:20,980 --> 00:19:21,961
or just the number of digits,

376
00:19:22,221 --> 00:19:23,461
we try to put them in game too,

377
00:19:23,761 --> 00:19:24,962
give that kind of credit to them.

378
00:19:26,003 --> 00:19:26,883
So we tried this for a year,

379
00:19:27,363 --> 00:19:30,165
and one third of our game content was done in this way,

380
00:19:30,285 --> 00:19:31,946
was generated as player designs.

381
00:19:33,283 --> 00:19:34,744
Just quickly go over some good practice.

382
00:19:35,485 --> 00:19:37,226
The first two we learned through our own mistakes.

383
00:19:38,487 --> 00:19:39,508
Bring RuneLabs in-game.

384
00:19:39,548 --> 00:19:41,910
So bring your system for generating

385
00:19:42,330 --> 00:19:44,872
and upvoting player ideas in-game.

386
00:19:45,793 --> 00:19:48,275
We didn't do this, and what we found was

387
00:19:48,395 --> 00:19:50,677
player ideas are not generated from having

388
00:19:50,957 --> 00:19:53,699
a book by the side of their bed for dream ideas

389
00:19:54,179 --> 00:19:54,680
or anything like this.

390
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:57,702
They're not molyneuing just randomly.

391
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,164
Their ideas are generated by playing the game.

392
00:20:00,745 --> 00:20:01,906
They come across something in the game.

393
00:20:02,767 --> 00:20:03,867
And they have an idea for it.

394
00:20:04,308 --> 00:20:06,249
That was largely where all of the player ideas came from.

395
00:20:06,269 --> 00:20:08,010
Talk a little bit more about that in a moment.

396
00:20:09,411 --> 00:20:11,733
So if the ReLab system is in game, it can do that.

397
00:20:12,645 --> 00:20:15,526
Ensure a fair and dynamic trending algorithms.

398
00:20:15,646 --> 00:20:18,586
Obviously, iTunes and other systems suffer from this.

399
00:20:18,826 --> 00:20:21,727
We found that good ideas were not necessarily rising to the top,

400
00:20:21,947 --> 00:20:24,208
because our trending algorithms were not strong.

401
00:20:25,128 --> 00:20:27,229
And often, setting criteria for the players,

402
00:20:27,369 --> 00:20:29,790
limiting the space for the idea, generated more.

403
00:20:30,530 --> 00:20:32,370
We found that just saying, give us any old idea,

404
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,091
would give us 50% less in terms of ideas, fewer ideas,

405
00:20:36,611 --> 00:20:38,912
than if we said, create a quest with flying bears.

406
00:20:41,984 --> 00:20:45,887
So the flaws, oh actually, I might just skip back quickly here.

407
00:20:45,907 --> 00:20:48,348
So we did kind of contingency work to try to figure out

408
00:20:48,388 --> 00:20:50,209
what we thought the problems would be for RuneLabs.

409
00:20:50,449 --> 00:20:52,110
We sat down and discussed it, we tried to plan for them,

410
00:20:52,391 --> 00:20:55,853
and our worries were that the ideas would be unworkable.

411
00:20:56,733 --> 00:20:59,794
They would be massive. They'd be massively overpowered. It would create power creep.

412
00:21:00,395 --> 00:21:02,236
The ideas that were simply unworkable.

413
00:21:02,316 --> 00:21:04,697
We thought those were the ideas that would come from the user base.

414
00:21:05,077 --> 00:21:07,839
We thought that we'd be culling so many of them

415
00:21:08,319 --> 00:21:10,920
that players would kind of be disengaged from the whole process

416
00:21:11,181 --> 00:21:14,042
because none of the kind of the top ideas were getting into the game.

417
00:21:14,883 --> 00:21:16,804
That wasn't the case. In fact, players were low-balling.

418
00:21:17,124 --> 00:21:20,706
They really wanted their content in the game, so they went smaller than the criteria that we set them.

419
00:21:21,492 --> 00:21:25,195
They really wanted that content in-game. We were completely blown away by that.

420
00:21:25,875 --> 00:21:29,418
The problems with RuneLabs were that there was hugely limited engagement.

421
00:21:30,700 --> 00:21:35,183
In terms of submitting, only 1 in 100 of our player base ever submitted an idea.

422
00:21:36,344 --> 00:21:38,606
So we started trying to drill down into why that was the case.

423
00:21:40,365 --> 00:21:45,710
The first one the players told us was there were a number of obstacles to putting an idea into the game was too large.

424
00:21:46,170 --> 00:21:53,436
They had to create an idea, or to come up with an idea, write it, post it, wait for feedback, and wait to see the numbers, and they got polled.

425
00:21:53,456 --> 00:21:55,638
The number of obstacles were too large.

426
00:21:55,959 --> 00:21:59,282
They also were kind of riding naked through the court of public opinion.

427
00:21:59,902 --> 00:22:00,603
They were worried about that.

428
00:22:00,973 --> 00:22:03,994
They're really worried about being kind of humiliated by their friends.

429
00:22:04,514 --> 00:22:07,295
But once we drilled down, we could find exactly why

430
00:22:07,735 --> 00:22:10,016
players were not interested in submitting their own ideas.

431
00:22:10,916 --> 00:22:15,098
The reason was, they were perfectly happy with the contract between developer and consumer.

432
00:22:15,718 --> 00:22:18,479
They liked being given game content and then playing it.

433
00:22:19,099 --> 00:22:22,160
They weren't interested in expanding that contract anymore, thank you very much.

434
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,301
They were perfectly happy with being delivered content.

435
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:26,822
And that was kind of the core of the player base.

436
00:22:27,692 --> 00:22:32,437
We also found that upvoting, some options were winning

437
00:22:33,037 --> 00:22:35,119
by only having 100 upvotes.

438
00:22:35,599 --> 00:22:38,362
That meant 1 1 100th of a percent of our player base

439
00:22:38,682 --> 00:22:42,566
were determining content for 1 3rd of our updates.

440
00:22:43,347 --> 00:22:44,848
That was vastly disproportional.

441
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:48,331
And we also found that it appealed

442
00:22:48,371 --> 00:22:50,533
to a specific subset of our game base.

443
00:22:51,796 --> 00:22:53,897
So the people who were interested in submitting ideas

444
00:22:54,057 --> 00:22:56,138
were largely those who were already socially quite mobile,

445
00:22:56,158 --> 00:22:57,878
they were communicating on social media.

446
00:22:58,319 --> 00:22:59,259
There are two reasons for that.

447
00:22:59,479 --> 00:23:01,420
It makes sense that those people who were willing to talk

448
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,020
and spend a lot of time outside of the game,

449
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:04,041
talking to each other,

450
00:23:04,301 --> 00:23:06,942
also willing to kind of write a lot of stuff and relapse.

451
00:23:07,482 --> 00:23:09,983
They also had an inbuilt base of hundreds of fans

452
00:23:10,043 --> 00:23:12,404
in terms of their Twitter followers, or Reddit followers.

453
00:23:14,112 --> 00:23:16,217
And so because there were so few upvotes,

454
00:23:16,357 --> 00:23:17,720
they were immediately rising up to the top.

455
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:19,243
And that created a cult of celebrity,

456
00:23:19,684 --> 00:23:21,688
whereby the topmost voters were all of those people

457
00:23:21,708 --> 00:23:24,574
who were the most kind of active on social media.

458
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:30,822
And when we start breaking down the ideas, there are only very specific ideas that were coming from our player base.

459
00:23:30,882 --> 00:23:33,923
And it's worth noting this if you think about generating player designs.

460
00:23:35,064 --> 00:23:39,446
Fixes or improvements were predominant in all of the player ideas.

461
00:23:39,986 --> 00:23:43,627
They were hitting their heads against walls or ceilings in game content

462
00:23:43,947 --> 00:23:45,708
and wanting to remove those walls and ceilings.

463
00:23:46,829 --> 00:23:50,750
Like, I can't defeat this beast because there is not a good enough sword to defeat it.

464
00:23:51,351 --> 00:23:52,071
I want that sword.

465
00:23:53,471 --> 00:23:55,491
Everything was a reaction against the ceiling or wall.

466
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:58,312
And the other one was reacting to good content in-game.

467
00:23:58,392 --> 00:23:59,532
They like certain things.

468
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:00,473
They want more of it.

469
00:24:00,533 --> 00:24:03,573
Our first winning poll was, give me two more dragons.

470
00:24:03,853 --> 00:24:05,154
There was no more text in the design.

471
00:24:05,714 --> 00:24:06,894
They wanted two more dragons.

472
00:24:07,714 --> 00:24:08,254
So we gave them it.

473
00:24:09,215 --> 00:24:10,695
And that's just a sequel to more content.

474
00:24:12,335 --> 00:24:13,335
And the other one is fan fiction.

475
00:24:13,716 --> 00:24:15,636
We found that players had stories they wanted to tell,

476
00:24:15,696 --> 00:24:16,976
characters they wanted to bring in-game.

477
00:24:17,496 --> 00:24:18,977
There was no game mechanics in that design.

478
00:24:19,137 --> 00:24:20,777
They simply wanted to have that character in-game.

479
00:24:22,824 --> 00:24:24,965
But there were benefits, not all doom and gloom.

480
00:24:25,685 --> 00:24:28,186
We actually understand our players more and better from

481
00:24:28,226 --> 00:24:28,587
doing this.

482
00:24:28,847 --> 00:24:30,647
We now know what they value or don't value.

483
00:24:31,088 --> 00:24:33,829
Because the vast proportion were fixes, we actually found

484
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:36,810
that players valued things, smaller changes to the game,

485
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,211
quality of life improvements.

486
00:24:38,891 --> 00:24:41,632
We didn't see them as valuable, as something big, a

487
00:24:41,712 --> 00:24:42,413
quest, perhaps.

488
00:24:43,053 --> 00:24:44,914
We actually increased headcount within our Ninja team,

489
00:24:44,934 --> 00:24:47,195
which is the team that makes smaller updates to the game,

490
00:24:47,415 --> 00:24:48,396
because of RuneLabs.

491
00:24:48,996 --> 00:24:50,577
We also had several ideas we thought they liked,

492
00:24:50,937 --> 00:24:53,339
that we had previously mentioned in other kind of livestreams,

493
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:53,759
stuff like that.

494
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:55,560
They didn't value them. They never rose to the top.

495
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,421
We soon learned to kind of disregard those as chaff.

496
00:24:59,242 --> 00:25:00,763
And we know what ideas players now generate.

497
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:03,384
We now can go to them for fixes and improvements and sequels.

498
00:25:03,844 --> 00:25:06,306
We know that they're a solid producer of these things.

499
00:25:07,847 --> 00:25:09,388
And great for us is there's no more

500
00:25:09,648 --> 00:25:10,728
we could have done that better.

501
00:25:11,961 --> 00:25:13,963
There was a lot of conversation before RuneLabs

502
00:25:14,443 --> 00:25:16,485
that why you put this update up,

503
00:25:17,066 --> 00:25:17,906
we could have done that better.

504
00:25:18,207 --> 00:25:20,108
They now understand the value of the design work that we do.

505
00:25:21,990 --> 00:25:23,491
So my takeaways from RuneLabs,

506
00:25:23,511 --> 00:25:25,493
so bringing players into the crowdsourcing of game design,

507
00:25:26,634 --> 00:25:28,236
is that the core of your player base,

508
00:25:28,476 --> 00:25:29,737
or potential player base,

509
00:25:29,977 --> 00:25:31,819
is likely not interested in designing their game.

510
00:25:32,339 --> 00:25:34,421
And that creates a tension that you may have to understand.

511
00:25:34,822 --> 00:25:36,863
That a small minority will be creating content

512
00:25:37,164 --> 00:25:38,745
for a majority that doesn't want it.

513
00:25:39,902 --> 00:25:43,844
Our story players were actually almost engaged with RuneLabs.

514
00:25:44,144 --> 00:25:44,785
That makes sense.

515
00:25:45,065 --> 00:25:47,286
They read a lot of text, codices and journals in game.

516
00:25:47,306 --> 00:25:49,207
They're perfectly happy with writing a lot of text

517
00:25:49,267 --> 00:25:49,808
on RuneLabs.

518
00:25:50,408 --> 00:25:52,109
While they were a minority when it came to the polls,

519
00:25:52,409 --> 00:25:54,090
with RuneLabs, they were suddenly the majority.

520
00:25:54,791 --> 00:25:56,872
So virtually every update that came out with RuneLabs

521
00:25:56,892 --> 00:25:57,853
was story-oriented.

522
00:25:58,433 --> 00:26:00,914
You're creating content that a majority may not want.

523
00:26:02,155 --> 00:26:04,517
But valuable ideas were generated, particularly with fixes.

524
00:26:05,017 --> 00:26:06,338
And maybe look to harness those ideas,

525
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,218
maybe by other means.

526
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,442
So I lied when I said I wouldn't go into more of the crowdsourcing methods, but very quickly,

527
00:26:12,363 --> 00:26:13,824
I'd like to bring you into the release schedule survey.

528
00:26:13,844 --> 00:26:15,886
This is where we've ended up, effectively our conclusion.

529
00:26:16,106 --> 00:26:19,949
We tried to take all of the best parts of the various different methods and we come across this.

530
00:26:21,170 --> 00:26:26,013
So what it is, is we approach our idea generators for ideas, design ideas.

531
00:26:26,293 --> 00:26:28,695
We then pull them together with developer ideas.

532
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:31,197
We have a kind of open idea session within our office.

533
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,139
And we also pull those with the ideas that are generated by kind of data

534
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,881
and the needs of the game, holistic needs of the game.

535
00:26:38,142 --> 00:26:40,423
We then create a survey, ask our players to rate each update

536
00:26:40,743 --> 00:26:42,584
out of 10, and then they get to play a game.

537
00:26:43,365 --> 00:26:45,946
They're creating their own release schedule for that year.

538
00:26:45,966 --> 00:26:48,207
So they take their 12 updates, put them into months,

539
00:26:48,547 --> 00:26:49,888
and they form their own release schedule.

540
00:26:50,749 --> 00:26:51,649
We then reveal the results,

541
00:26:51,789 --> 00:26:52,970
and this is all of a kind of big event.

542
00:26:53,850 --> 00:26:55,772
What I value about this is what it kind of gains,

543
00:26:55,992 --> 00:26:57,433
takes from the benefits of each individual one,

544
00:26:57,513 --> 00:26:58,513
and loses some of the negatives.

545
00:26:58,773 --> 00:27:00,614
For Relabs, it harnesses our creative players,

546
00:27:00,935 --> 00:27:02,375
but ensures there's a broad range of ideas,

547
00:27:02,395 --> 00:27:03,536
because we are filling in the gaps.

548
00:27:04,537 --> 00:27:05,397
With the design documents,

549
00:27:05,637 --> 00:27:07,618
we understand the players' expectations.

550
00:27:09,150 --> 00:27:15,431
So what that means is, because we're putting all of these updates out there, we now know what they think of them, we know what they're valuing.

551
00:27:15,732 --> 00:27:20,712
But we lose that cost of the design document being to have such high overheads.

552
00:27:20,732 --> 00:27:23,553
We're not designing everything and putting it out there in a player design document.

553
00:27:24,213 --> 00:27:28,594
With polls, you get that increased engagement player impact, so do we get with the release schedule survey.

554
00:27:28,974 --> 00:27:30,814
But it's a more malleable contract with the players.

555
00:27:31,274 --> 00:27:36,415
Our contract is, you get to help us determine the major updates, we're going to keep all of the smaller fixes to ourselves.

556
00:27:38,496 --> 00:27:39,719
So takeaways for this talk.

557
00:27:39,739 --> 00:27:42,385
We'd like you to understand that crowdsourcing game design,

558
00:27:42,425 --> 00:27:45,993
from our experience, a limited number of players out there

559
00:27:46,154 --> 00:27:47,537
are interested in developing ideas.

560
00:27:48,435 --> 00:28:04,010
I'm creating ideas and there is a limited shape of those ideas understand that you will not get a full broad range of ideas from your players could be done could there be a game that successfully incorporates all of their players to play design perhaps I think it built game was built and promoted around that concept it could well happen.

561
00:28:04,771 --> 00:28:10,797
But for us we were trying to solve a problem that wasn't there and we're going pulling back from room labs and making it moving on to that really schedule survey.

562
00:28:12,203 --> 00:28:14,064
But there is such value in bringing players

563
00:28:14,084 --> 00:28:15,145
into your design process.

564
00:28:15,706 --> 00:28:16,706
There's more conversation.

565
00:28:17,027 --> 00:28:19,448
As I said, that sine wave of chatter

566
00:28:19,849 --> 00:28:21,010
has changed to a constant.

567
00:28:21,370 --> 00:28:22,591
We're seeing players talking all the more.

568
00:28:23,451 --> 00:28:25,113
And we know that when players are talking,

569
00:28:25,133 --> 00:28:26,534
they're more engaged.

570
00:28:26,574 --> 00:28:28,015
And if they're more engaged, they're more retained.

571
00:28:28,055 --> 00:28:31,318
We actually see kind of a link between dialogue,

572
00:28:31,458 --> 00:28:33,319
talking in game, and being retained.

573
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:35,881
And you have a focused release date

574
00:28:35,921 --> 00:28:38,643
that isn't, you're not side-winded by unnecessary.

575
00:28:39,587 --> 00:28:43,550
Unnecessary elements and the culture shift between a relationship with our player base and us is huge

576
00:28:44,230 --> 00:28:48,854
Our players now understand their own community. They understand their different player types. They understand the difficulties of design

577
00:28:48,874 --> 00:28:52,737
And I look at where we were before and we did everything here

578
00:28:53,178 --> 00:28:56,941
And well, the whole health of our relationship with the players is massively changed

579
00:28:57,441 --> 00:29:02,505
You'll know whether your game in your community would benefit from incorporating players into a design

580
00:29:03,306 --> 00:29:06,308
But the cost for us has been worth it and we have a healthier game for it

581
00:29:07,900 --> 00:29:20,362
So thank you very much. As I predicted, there is no time for questions, but please come up to the front and we can have a chat. We'll go over to 2022 to discuss more about crowdsourcing game design. Thank you very much.
