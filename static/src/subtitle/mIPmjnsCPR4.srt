1
00:00:06,413 --> 00:00:08,474
So I'm assuming, this is mic been tested,

2
00:00:08,494 --> 00:00:09,454
you guys can all hear me and everything.

3
00:00:09,474 --> 00:00:10,234
All right, excellent.

4
00:00:11,375 --> 00:00:11,955
So welcome.

5
00:00:12,615 --> 00:00:13,936
Let me start with this.

6
00:00:14,276 --> 00:00:15,957
I'll just sit down and watch this too with you guys.

7
00:00:19,898 --> 00:00:20,498
Do it!

8
00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:23,259
Just do it!

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,861
Don't let your dreams be dreams.

10
00:00:27,881 --> 00:00:29,542
Yesterday, you said tomorrow.

11
00:00:29,802 --> 00:00:31,443
So just do it!

12
00:00:31,883 --> 00:00:34,024
Make your dreams come true!

13
00:00:34,604 --> 00:00:34,844
Just!

14
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:36,180
Do it!

15
00:00:39,182 --> 00:00:42,985
Some people dream of success while you're gonna wake up and work hard at it.

16
00:00:43,345 --> 00:00:44,646
Nothing is impossible!

17
00:00:46,967 --> 00:00:51,890
You should get to the point where anyone else would quit, and you're not gonna stop there!

18
00:00:52,911 --> 00:00:54,332
No! What are you waiting for?

19
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:56,453
Do it!

20
00:00:58,615 --> 00:00:58,955
Just...

21
00:01:00,516 --> 00:01:01,136
Do it!

22
00:01:01,717 --> 00:01:02,617
Yes, you can!

23
00:01:03,578 --> 00:01:04,398
Just do it!

24
00:01:09,294 --> 00:01:13,817
If you're tired of starting over, stop giving up.

25
00:01:20,482 --> 00:01:20,942
All right.

26
00:01:23,164 --> 00:01:26,726
So that might be inspiring to you.

27
00:01:26,766 --> 00:01:27,646
It might be funny to you.

28
00:01:27,666 --> 00:01:28,887
It's kind of both to me, right?

29
00:01:29,768 --> 00:01:31,289
But the reason I'm showing it to you

30
00:01:31,309 --> 00:01:33,590
is because that kind of stuff is important, right?

31
00:01:33,610 --> 00:01:35,011
That initial burst of motivation,

32
00:01:35,632 --> 00:01:37,113
that call to instantaneous action.

33
00:01:37,568 --> 00:01:38,889
But it's not a process, right?

34
00:01:39,009 --> 00:01:40,510
Just doing it, waking up tomorrow

35
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,971
and changing your life or whatever.

36
00:01:42,271 --> 00:01:44,112
There's a difference between this kind of momentary

37
00:01:44,152 --> 00:01:47,054
motivation and true long haul productivity.

38
00:01:48,294 --> 00:01:50,596
And part of being independent is that we're

39
00:01:50,636 --> 00:01:55,839
trying to escape from this world, right?

40
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,500
All those things that go along with business

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:01:59,862
seem like maybe like hell to some people in this room.

42
00:02:00,762 --> 00:02:03,224
Rigid schedules, deadlines, strict separation

43
00:02:03,304 --> 00:02:04,845
of work and non-work time.

44
00:02:05,587 --> 00:02:08,149
One of my friends even said, I'm making games because I enjoy it.

45
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:09,510
I want to enjoy the process.

46
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,191
I don't want to be too hard on myself.

47
00:02:11,592 --> 00:02:13,153
And we can do it however we want.

48
00:02:14,253 --> 00:02:15,514
We can have flexible schedules.

49
00:02:15,534 --> 00:02:16,555
We can keep odd hours.

50
00:02:16,615 --> 00:02:17,996
We can work only when we want to work.

51
00:02:18,456 --> 00:02:21,278
We can interleave work and non-work time throughout the day.

52
00:02:21,719 --> 00:02:23,880
And this might be enjoyable for a while.

53
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,102
But in the end, the reality is, any of you who've shipped a game know,

54
00:02:27,403 --> 00:02:30,225
shipping a game takes a lot of hard, extended work.

55
00:02:30,842 --> 00:02:33,103
And it is our job, really, at the end of the day,

56
00:02:33,123 --> 00:02:34,504
if we want to keep doing this over the long haul,

57
00:02:34,524 --> 00:02:36,304
if we want to make a career out of it, a life of it.

58
00:02:36,845 --> 00:02:38,946
And this is a rhetorical question,

59
00:02:38,986 --> 00:02:40,506
I'm not asking for a show of hands here.

60
00:02:41,547 --> 00:02:43,587
But think about how many people in this room,

61
00:02:43,648 --> 00:02:46,449
at some point in their careers, failed to ship their game

62
00:02:47,329 --> 00:02:49,330
and had to go back to work because they ran out of money.

63
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:51,831
I have several friends who have had this happen.

64
00:02:52,171 --> 00:02:54,892
And there's nothing enjoyable about that, right?

65
00:02:55,092 --> 00:02:57,993
So these business guys, they aren't idiots.

66
00:02:59,071 --> 00:03:01,053
If they could squeeze extra productivity out of their teams

67
00:03:01,133 --> 00:03:02,894
by letting them work out in bed,

68
00:03:03,594 --> 00:03:06,076
they'd do it in a heartbeat and install beds in every cubicle.

69
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:09,658
And this guy here, he's looking at his watch in this picture.

70
00:03:11,079 --> 00:03:13,321
That's this classic kind of over-scheduled business thing,

71
00:03:13,341 --> 00:03:14,502
the kind of thing we want to avoid.

72
00:03:14,842 --> 00:03:16,123
You know, we hear business adages like,

73
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:18,144
time is money and all that kind of crap.

74
00:03:18,564 --> 00:03:21,426
But even if we don't care about maximizing money per unit time,

75
00:03:22,467 --> 00:03:24,048
we also need to consider this, right?

76
00:03:24,448 --> 00:03:25,849
You only have enough time in life

77
00:03:26,249 --> 00:03:27,690
to ship a limited number of games.

78
00:03:28,147 --> 00:03:31,269
And so my central thesis is that making games is our job,

79
00:03:31,329 --> 00:03:32,950
it's our business, it's what we busy ourselves with,

80
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,332
it's our life's work if we're gonna take it that seriously,

81
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,013
and we should behave like we're working

82
00:03:37,033 --> 00:03:38,134
when we're making them.

83
00:03:38,694 --> 00:03:40,135
And we should manage ourselves

84
00:03:40,175 --> 00:03:42,017
the way we'd manage an employee.

85
00:03:42,677 --> 00:03:43,998
And like a business might do,

86
00:03:44,238 --> 00:03:46,640
we can start by taking an inventory of past performance

87
00:03:46,660 --> 00:03:48,101
of employee number one.

88
00:03:49,152 --> 00:03:51,052
which might be ourselves or our team

89
00:03:51,152 --> 00:03:53,113
or we've been working over our whole career.

90
00:03:53,393 --> 00:03:55,313
I've done this for myself, and I'm going to walk through it now.

91
00:03:55,893 --> 00:03:57,774
And I actually did this for all 19 of my games,

92
00:03:58,334 --> 00:04:00,275
but it's a lot of data to put up on the screen.

93
00:04:00,335 --> 00:04:02,295
So I'm just going to give a quick highlight,

94
00:04:02,635 --> 00:04:03,876
picking three games out of the 19.

95
00:04:04,396 --> 00:04:06,956
She talked about Passage before.

96
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:09,297
That came out in 2007, long, ancient history.

97
00:04:09,317 --> 00:04:10,197
Only 4,700 lines of code.

98
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:10,838
Only took me 14 days.

99
00:04:14,465 --> 00:04:17,347
to get it out and shown at the Gamma event that it was made for,

100
00:04:17,687 --> 00:04:20,648
and then another two months total to finally put music to it

101
00:04:20,688 --> 00:04:22,089
and get it out to a wide release.

102
00:04:22,569 --> 00:04:25,350
Most popular game by far, downloaded by 500,000 people,

103
00:04:25,711 --> 00:04:26,791
and brought in pretty much no money.

104
00:04:28,092 --> 00:04:32,254
Thirteen games later, in between Passage and the Castle Doctrine,

105
00:04:32,274 --> 00:04:34,535
which I'm showing you because it's my most commercially successful game,

106
00:04:35,215 --> 00:04:38,236
a big success for me, commercial success is relative, right?

107
00:04:38,917 --> 00:04:39,617
For a team of one.

108
00:04:40,678 --> 00:04:41,218
Came out in March 2013.

109
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:45,905
a whole order of magnitude more lines of code here.

110
00:04:46,326 --> 00:04:49,248
47,000 lines of code, 13 months instead of 14 days

111
00:04:50,048 --> 00:04:51,549
to develop it and get it out to the public.

112
00:04:51,609 --> 00:04:54,051
And then a total of 25 months, once it was out to the public

113
00:04:54,071 --> 00:04:56,013
and I was updating it and so on.

114
00:04:56,053 --> 00:04:58,094
20,000 downloads, much smaller in terms of impact,

115
00:04:58,154 --> 00:05:00,476
but much bigger in terms of $247,000,

116
00:05:01,316 --> 00:05:03,378
which was a lot of money for an individual at the time

117
00:05:04,279 --> 00:05:05,519
for the development cycle that it was.

118
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,341
Now fast forward a few more years,

119
00:05:07,421 --> 00:05:09,042
one hour in life, my project that actually just

120
00:05:09,062 --> 00:05:09,883
came out two weeks ago.

121
00:05:10,603 --> 00:05:10,943
89,000 lines of code.

122
00:05:13,575 --> 00:05:15,655
33 month development time to initial public release,

123
00:05:16,236 --> 00:05:18,236
and who knows how many more years I'm gonna be working on it

124
00:05:18,256 --> 00:05:19,637
doing weekly updates into the future.

125
00:05:20,757 --> 00:05:21,918
So before I did this analysis,

126
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:24,179
I had this graph in my mind generally, right?

127
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:26,340
Like, as someone who's supporting my family,

128
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,441
making video games, like I'm making a little bit more money

129
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,861
in each game, and it's kind of going up,

130
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:31,242
and like, wow, the Castle Doctrine made more

131
00:05:31,262 --> 00:05:32,522
than anything else, that's a good trend.

132
00:05:32,862 --> 00:05:34,143
Except for Cordroom Inuit there,

133
00:05:34,183 --> 00:05:36,124
which is like this bad outlier where I lost money.

134
00:05:36,164 --> 00:05:37,824
But that's not a common thing for me, right?

135
00:05:37,864 --> 00:05:39,385
Game after game, I'm making a little bit more money,

136
00:05:39,405 --> 00:05:40,125
and it's even curving.

137
00:05:40,494 --> 00:05:41,815
It looks like it's curving, doesn't it?

138
00:05:42,055 --> 00:05:43,436
Parabolically, that's good, right?

139
00:05:45,257 --> 00:05:48,379
And I also had a general sense, and until I did the analysis,

140
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:52,761
I wasn't quite sure, that the projects are getting more

141
00:05:52,802 --> 00:05:54,022
complicated as they go along.

142
00:05:54,703 --> 00:05:56,144
The number of lines of code, and it's true,

143
00:05:56,184 --> 00:05:57,384
the number of lines of code per game

144
00:05:57,424 --> 00:05:58,805
are kind of going up on a similar curve,

145
00:05:59,205 --> 00:06:00,966
working on bigger and bigger things,

146
00:06:01,046 --> 00:06:03,668
with one hour of life being really complicated, right?

147
00:06:03,748 --> 00:06:06,470
Multi-sharded server, multiplayer simultaneous world

148
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:08,431
with real-time interactions and all this kind of stuff.

149
00:06:08,824 --> 00:06:10,525
So I'm getting better and better as an engineer.

150
00:06:10,545 --> 00:06:12,626
I'm working on bigger and bigger and crazier and crazier things.

151
00:06:14,167 --> 00:06:16,128
But I'm also spending more time.

152
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:19,809
So this graph is also kind of going upward at the same rate.

153
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:21,870
And that allows us to talk about productivity.

154
00:06:22,751 --> 00:06:25,792
So how many lines of code did I produce each week

155
00:06:25,812 --> 00:06:26,693
that I worked on the game?

156
00:06:27,073 --> 00:06:29,294
Development productivity, not monetary productivity.

157
00:06:29,374 --> 00:06:31,455
But hey, look, it peaked at sleep is death.

158
00:06:31,495 --> 00:06:33,256
It's been pretty sad ever since then.

159
00:06:33,676 --> 00:06:35,557
Only producing the castle doctrine,

160
00:06:35,577 --> 00:06:37,178
I only produced 500 lines of code per week.

161
00:06:37,238 --> 00:06:38,098
That's pretty bad.

162
00:06:39,105 --> 00:06:39,606
Pretty sad.

163
00:06:40,126 --> 00:06:41,666
And then you can look at financial productivity.

164
00:06:42,907 --> 00:06:45,488
How many dollars did I make per week that I spent on the game?

165
00:06:45,508 --> 00:06:46,829
And that also peaked to sleep as death

166
00:06:46,849 --> 00:06:47,849
and has been going slowly down.

167
00:06:47,909 --> 00:06:49,870
Even though I made way more money on the Castle Doctrine,

168
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:53,352
I spent so much longer on it that I really only made

169
00:06:53,392 --> 00:06:55,613
$2,000 a week working on it, which isn't so great.

170
00:06:56,953 --> 00:06:57,234
OK.

171
00:06:58,774 --> 00:07:02,196
So we can go deeper than this and a lot more detailed

172
00:07:02,236 --> 00:07:03,917
because of the magic of version control.

173
00:07:04,397 --> 00:07:05,457
So I've been using version control

174
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:07,878
throughout my whole career, even before I started making games.

175
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:12,446
Back passage and those early games were done in CBS,

176
00:07:12,507 --> 00:07:13,967
if anyone here in the room remembers CBS.

177
00:07:14,487 --> 00:07:16,388
And then I eventually moved to Mercurial,

178
00:07:16,428 --> 00:07:18,808
and now I'm using Git for one hour, one life.

179
00:07:19,308 --> 00:07:21,769
And so I have detailed logs of the entire production

180
00:07:21,789 --> 00:07:23,109
history of every single project going back

181
00:07:23,129 --> 00:07:23,970
to my entire career.

182
00:07:24,350 --> 00:07:26,510
And you can see the logs that come out of version control

183
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,091
tell exactly how many lines were added

184
00:07:28,151 --> 00:07:29,891
at what hour, minute, and second of the day.

185
00:07:30,712 --> 00:07:33,132
So that allows us to do a more detailed analysis

186
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:34,113
of something like this.

187
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,813
This is my entire career in a graph.

188
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,033
Lines of code.

189
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:38,693
Lines of code per week.

190
00:07:39,213 --> 00:07:40,194
And it's kind of noisy, right?

191
00:07:40,214 --> 00:07:41,595
So we're not going to get that much out of that.

192
00:07:41,675 --> 00:07:43,817
But let's break it down by month instead, bin it by month.

193
00:07:44,337 --> 00:07:45,138
Lines of code per month.

194
00:07:45,218 --> 00:07:46,659
And then we can annotate it with the different games

195
00:07:46,679 --> 00:07:47,439
that I've worked on, right?

196
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:50,922
And so you can see there are some games that

197
00:07:50,942 --> 00:07:52,623
are super productive on, other games less so.

198
00:07:52,683 --> 00:07:53,884
Some games are really spiky.

199
00:07:54,525 --> 00:07:55,766
And a lot of it's ancient history.

200
00:07:55,806 --> 00:07:57,347
So I don't have details about why.

201
00:07:57,807 --> 00:07:59,548
Like, look at Sleep is Death in the middle there.

202
00:07:59,648 --> 00:08:00,489
There's a drop in the middle.

203
00:08:00,509 --> 00:08:01,890
I don't remember exactly what happened there,

204
00:08:01,930 --> 00:08:04,312
why I had two big productivity spikes and a drop in the middle

205
00:08:04,332 --> 00:08:06,333
because I don't have my calendars anymore from that era.

206
00:08:07,216 --> 00:08:08,697
So for the rest of the talk, I'm going to focus on

207
00:08:08,777 --> 00:08:10,178
One Hour One Life, the most recent project,

208
00:08:10,198 --> 00:08:12,160
because I remember what happened over the past three years.

209
00:08:12,801 --> 00:08:14,622
So these are lines of code per week

210
00:08:14,742 --> 00:08:15,963
from the entire One Hour One Life

211
00:08:16,023 --> 00:08:17,565
three year long development process.

212
00:08:19,166 --> 00:08:21,228
Now first of all, when you look at this graph,

213
00:08:22,429 --> 00:08:23,730
there's a little bit of a problem.

214
00:08:23,990 --> 00:08:25,031
Like see these troughs, right?

215
00:08:25,071 --> 00:08:27,433
Where there's zero lines of code several weeks in a row.

216
00:08:27,494 --> 00:08:29,175
And at first I saw this, I was like, oh no.

217
00:08:29,736 --> 00:08:30,776
Did I really go through some weeks

218
00:08:30,857 --> 00:08:32,298
where I didn't get anything done?

219
00:08:32,478 --> 00:08:33,439
I didn't think it was that bad.

220
00:08:34,722 --> 00:08:36,304
But then I realized when I looked at my calendar

221
00:08:36,604 --> 00:08:37,805
that these were my family vacations.

222
00:08:37,825 --> 00:08:40,047
It's like, OK, well, that's good.

223
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:41,948
I didn't work during family vacation.

224
00:08:42,349 --> 00:08:44,350
Go away to visit relatives to New York or whatever

225
00:08:44,731 --> 00:08:47,053
and see family for three weeks or two weeks, and that's fine.

226
00:08:47,453 --> 00:08:48,674
I saw some other zeros on the graph.

227
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:50,075
I was like, oh, no, well, what about that week?

228
00:08:50,095 --> 00:08:51,196
That wasn't a family vacation.

229
00:08:51,737 --> 00:08:53,138
Oh, well, those were some conferences I went to.

230
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,080
That's cool, too, right?

231
00:08:55,440 --> 00:08:56,861
That doesn't explain all the zeros on the graph.

232
00:08:56,901 --> 00:08:58,362
I'll get to a couple more of the zeros in a minute.

233
00:08:58,963 --> 00:09:00,805
But at least most of them were accounted for.

234
00:09:02,322 --> 00:09:04,043
OK, so let's annotate the rest of this graph.

235
00:09:04,083 --> 00:09:07,725
So in the beginning, I'm in game honeymoon, new project,

236
00:09:07,826 --> 00:09:09,226
getting a lot done, client server,

237
00:09:09,286 --> 00:09:10,087
everything's going well.

238
00:09:10,487 --> 00:09:13,309
And then I come back from vacation, it looks like,

239
00:09:13,389 --> 00:09:16,871
actually, and get into this slump, where productivity,

240
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,412
I'm feeling burned out.

241
00:09:18,452 --> 00:09:18,912
It's game number 19.

242
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:22,114
And I know I've got a long way to go.

243
00:09:22,134 --> 00:09:23,955
I know this is the biggest project I've ever tackled

244
00:09:23,995 --> 00:09:25,096
and stuck in the thick of it.

245
00:09:25,736 --> 00:09:27,397
And then I have a zero week there

246
00:09:27,417 --> 00:09:28,518
that you see at the end of the slump.

247
00:09:29,175 --> 00:09:32,636
And that's also justified because my lifelong friend

248
00:09:32,656 --> 00:09:36,557
of 25 years moved to Davis to join the project with me.

249
00:09:36,617 --> 00:09:38,157
I said, you know, dude, this is a big project.

250
00:09:38,197 --> 00:09:39,558
You can make the artwork and the music for this,

251
00:09:39,578 --> 00:09:40,438
and we can work on it together.

252
00:09:40,458 --> 00:09:43,579
It was sort of this dream come true for the two of us

253
00:09:43,599 --> 00:09:44,719
to work on a big project together.

254
00:09:45,459 --> 00:09:47,379
So I spent a week, you know, getting them set up and so on.

255
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:49,920
And then we had this kind of adjustment period, right,

256
00:09:49,960 --> 00:09:51,680
where like it fits and starts.

257
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:53,001
We were moving into a new office.

258
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:54,421
We were trying to develop an art style.

259
00:09:54,441 --> 00:09:56,301
We showed the game at GDC and then tore all the artwork out

260
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:56,762
and redid it.

261
00:09:57,365 --> 00:10:01,108
tried to figure out all the way the editor needed to be changed to work with the kind

262
00:10:01,128 --> 00:10:02,269
of art he wanted to make and everything.

263
00:10:02,729 --> 00:10:05,772
But then we finally kind of hit our stride like halfway through the first year and we

264
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:07,653
had this period that was like I call on fire, right?

265
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:10,295
Big solid productivity week after week after week after week.

266
00:10:10,776 --> 00:10:12,056
What happens at the end, right?

267
00:10:12,417 --> 00:10:17,040
You can even hear the music at that little part of the graph go like wah wah wah wah.

268
00:10:17,921 --> 00:10:21,604
And that's one of the roughest periods of my life because that was the couple of weeks

269
00:10:21,664 --> 00:10:24,506
before I took my best friend of 25 years off the project.

270
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,439
Because things just, it was clear after a year

271
00:10:27,579 --> 00:10:29,040
and the fighting and stuff that was going on

272
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:30,241
toward the end especially that like,

273
00:10:30,481 --> 00:10:32,222
ah, are we really gonna do two more years of this?

274
00:10:32,702 --> 00:10:33,563
Are we really gonna struggle through

275
00:10:33,583 --> 00:10:34,503
two more years of working together?

276
00:10:34,523 --> 00:10:35,824
You know, working together is hard.

277
00:10:35,904 --> 00:10:37,825
I mean, a lot of people have had similar things happen.

278
00:10:38,426 --> 00:10:39,787
But for me, I was a friend of 25 years.

279
00:10:39,807 --> 00:10:41,388
I mean, people say, don't work with your friends

280
00:10:41,428 --> 00:10:42,168
and it's good advice.

281
00:10:43,929 --> 00:10:47,492
So, huge emotional blow, huge project blow,

282
00:10:47,512 --> 00:10:49,773
and then I'm left sort of picking up the pieces by myself,

283
00:10:49,813 --> 00:10:51,334
turning it back into a one person project.

284
00:10:52,152 --> 00:10:54,334
redoing all the art, redoing the music myself and everything,

285
00:10:54,414 --> 00:10:55,515
kind of a regrouping phase.

286
00:10:55,875 --> 00:10:56,996
But I do it, I get through it,

287
00:10:57,296 --> 00:10:58,457
going away on a family vacation,

288
00:10:58,477 --> 00:11:00,579
I think the game is pretty ready to release to alpha testers,

289
00:11:00,919 --> 00:11:03,301
come back from family vacation and have a test release.

290
00:11:03,381 --> 00:11:05,102
I get out to my alpha testers, they like it,

291
00:11:05,503 --> 00:11:07,244
it's cool, they're having fun and it's interesting

292
00:11:07,304 --> 00:11:10,027
and I'm excited to keep the momentum going

293
00:11:10,267 --> 00:11:12,328
and they're kind of getting bored with what's there

294
00:11:12,388 --> 00:11:13,810
and they have bugs that need fixed and so on,

295
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:16,212
so I go into this, kind of the most insane crunch

296
00:11:16,232 --> 00:11:16,872
of my life, right?

297
00:11:17,245 --> 00:11:18,867
I'm like, I want to release the end of the public soon.

298
00:11:18,907 --> 00:11:19,727
The alpha testers have it.

299
00:11:19,747 --> 00:11:20,848
I want to keep momentum with them

300
00:11:20,868 --> 00:11:22,570
so that there's a pool of them still playing

301
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:23,851
when I release to the public.

302
00:11:24,371 --> 00:11:28,534
And I end up doing these 16 hour days all week long,

303
00:11:28,594 --> 00:11:30,256
coming out only to eat meals with my family

304
00:11:30,476 --> 00:11:32,237
and not sleeping very well.

305
00:11:32,838 --> 00:11:34,299
But really pretty productive, right?

306
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,802
Then there's a little ledge there

307
00:11:37,822 --> 00:11:38,882
at the end of the insane crunch.

308
00:11:38,902 --> 00:11:39,923
I'm going to put a red line there.

309
00:11:40,384 --> 00:11:43,286
So that was the first time in my life where I've ever had.

310
00:11:43,802 --> 00:11:46,543
like a full-blown mental and physical breakdown.

311
00:11:46,563 --> 00:11:48,123
I've been pretty mentally healthy my whole life,

312
00:11:49,203 --> 00:11:51,144
and I didn't really know what it was when it hit me,

313
00:11:51,204 --> 00:11:52,604
but there was a time where I was like,

314
00:11:53,244 --> 00:11:54,984
shaking with a sense of existential doom,

315
00:11:55,024 --> 00:11:56,225
laying in bed quivering,

316
00:11:56,945 --> 00:11:58,385
thinking I was having a heart attack or a stroke.

317
00:11:58,505 --> 00:12:00,025
I didn't really even feel connected to the game.

318
00:12:00,625 --> 00:12:02,526
Finally went to the doctor and had my heart examined,

319
00:12:02,546 --> 00:12:03,646
and it turns out there's nothing wrong with me

320
00:12:03,706 --> 00:12:04,326
other than stress.

321
00:12:04,346 --> 00:12:05,646
And of course, you can see this graph

322
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:06,747
is a pretty stressful graph.

323
00:12:07,847 --> 00:12:09,087
So it's no surprise, but to me.

324
00:12:09,813 --> 00:12:11,654
It just felt like I was going to die.

325
00:12:12,035 --> 00:12:13,756
I didn't connect it to anything.

326
00:12:13,796 --> 00:12:15,257
I actually went to the doctor.

327
00:12:15,618 --> 00:12:16,478
He measured my heart rate.

328
00:12:16,899 --> 00:12:19,341
At resting heart rate in the office, it's 116.

329
00:12:19,801 --> 00:12:21,823
He's like, I think what's going on here, dude?

330
00:12:22,463 --> 00:12:23,524
But it was just stress, right?

331
00:12:24,845 --> 00:12:26,466
So that was a wake-up call, right?

332
00:12:28,608 --> 00:12:31,070
Having this big productivity spike that literally maybe

333
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:32,471
almost killed me, or at least felt like it did.

334
00:12:33,111 --> 00:12:34,212
So then I kind of regrouped.

335
00:12:34,252 --> 00:12:36,314
And the rest of this talk is about this regrouping process

336
00:12:36,694 --> 00:12:37,815
and exactly what.

337
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,132
it took to get back on track and have a more sane work-life

338
00:12:41,172 --> 00:12:43,933
balance and everything, and be able to get through this giant

339
00:12:43,953 --> 00:12:45,733
game eventually.

340
00:12:47,514 --> 00:12:52,636
So let's look at some of the other figures that

341
00:12:52,656 --> 00:12:54,356
are available to see exactly what happened

342
00:12:54,376 --> 00:12:56,057
during this insane crunch, because that's

343
00:12:56,097 --> 00:12:57,337
an interesting period to analyze.

344
00:12:58,018 --> 00:13:01,019
So here's a lifetime graph for me from all the way back

345
00:13:01,039 --> 00:13:04,640
to 2004 of lines of code per hour of the day taken out

346
00:13:04,660 --> 00:13:06,300
of version control and processed with a script.

347
00:13:07,021 --> 00:13:11,485
And this is a actually it's kind of a cool graph to look at but it's kind of a sad graph for me because I'm

348
00:13:11,585 --> 00:13:14,548
Supposed to be working in the morning. That's the agreement I have with my spouse, right?

349
00:13:15,468 --> 00:13:16,690
So we have three kids and you know

350
00:13:16,710 --> 00:13:20,393
I'm supposed to spend the afternoons with them and kind of be done at lunchtime essentially

351
00:13:20,613 --> 00:13:21,694
But you can see my productivity

352
00:13:21,734 --> 00:13:26,218
I mean I get up early in the morning and start working at 7 8 9 and so on and you can see my productivity in

353
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:31,763
The morning, it's really pretty poor where like at 9 a.m. It's worse than like 6 p.m. Like how is that?

354
00:13:31,783 --> 00:13:32,343
I'm not working 6 p.m.

355
00:13:33,387 --> 00:13:36,829
And you can also see me scrambling around noon or 1 p.m.

356
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,629
when I'm like, oh my gosh, my workday's supposed to be over,

357
00:13:38,649 --> 00:13:39,530
I'm supposed to hang out with my kids,

358
00:13:39,890 --> 00:13:41,350
like trying to actually get something done, right?

359
00:13:41,891 --> 00:13:44,872
Now, during crunch, during the insane crunch

360
00:13:44,892 --> 00:13:47,313
at the end of one hour in life, this gets even worse, right?

361
00:13:48,433 --> 00:13:50,294
I'm still working in the morning, doing these 16 hour days,

362
00:13:50,314 --> 00:13:51,274
getting up and starting at eight,

363
00:13:51,954 --> 00:13:54,035
but my productivity at 10 a.m. is worse

364
00:13:54,055 --> 00:13:56,816
than my productivity at 9 p.m. during that crunch, right?

365
00:13:57,176 --> 00:13:58,537
And you can also see me scrambling at noon,

366
00:13:58,577 --> 00:13:59,977
freaking out because the workday's half over,

367
00:14:00,878 --> 00:14:02,498
getting most of my work done toward the end of the day.

368
00:14:02,984 --> 00:14:03,925
Really inefficient use of time.

369
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:05,065
I'm in the office 16 hours,

370
00:14:05,105 --> 00:14:06,686
but I'm definitely not getting 16 hours of work done.

371
00:14:07,027 --> 00:14:07,827
What about days of the week?

372
00:14:08,187 --> 00:14:09,248
So throughout my career,

373
00:14:09,748 --> 00:14:10,669
these are the days of the week,

374
00:14:11,049 --> 00:14:13,030
lines of code per day of the week that I worked.

375
00:14:13,570 --> 00:14:14,671
A little sad,

376
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:16,152
because Friday is the most productive day

377
00:14:16,212 --> 00:14:16,592
when I'm like,

378
00:14:16,973 --> 00:14:17,953
I didn't get enough done this week,

379
00:14:17,993 --> 00:14:19,294
I gotta scramble and make up for it.

380
00:14:19,734 --> 00:14:20,875
During crunch, look what happens.

381
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:23,817
So this is really bad, right?

382
00:14:23,837 --> 00:14:24,517
Look at Wednesday.

383
00:14:25,618 --> 00:14:27,239
I'm working 16 hours on Wednesday,

384
00:14:27,339 --> 00:14:28,860
but I'm probably spending most of it

385
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,281
messing around on Reddit, I guess.

386
00:14:30,341 --> 00:14:30,861
I don't know, but.

387
00:14:31,595 --> 00:14:34,236
And Friday becomes far and away the most productive day,

388
00:14:34,256 --> 00:14:35,516
and it's even leaking into Saturday

389
00:14:35,536 --> 00:14:36,657
when I'm freaking out at the end of the week.

390
00:14:38,237 --> 00:14:42,098
So how did I fix this?

391
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:45,439
So let's get back to basics here.

392
00:14:45,459 --> 00:14:46,639
Like, how do you ship a game?

393
00:14:47,699 --> 00:14:49,120
How do you eventually ship a game guaranteed?

394
00:14:49,160 --> 00:14:50,140
Like, what's a guaranteed method?

395
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:51,320
Because shipping a game is hard.

396
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:51,920
We all know that.

397
00:14:53,061 --> 00:14:56,061
And so assuming you have these prerequisites,

398
00:14:56,121 --> 00:14:57,482
like you have the required skills

399
00:14:57,522 --> 00:14:59,042
to do whatever is necessary to make the game.

400
00:14:59,610 --> 00:15:01,551
and you know how to get through the process of making it.

401
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:03,151
And your game is appropriately scoped,

402
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:04,852
so you're not having scope creep and adding features

403
00:15:04,912 --> 00:15:06,172
and changing the game forever and ever.

404
00:15:07,272 --> 00:15:09,473
All you have to do to ship a game is work on the game,

405
00:15:10,293 --> 00:15:12,013
and work on the game, and work on the game, and work on the game.

406
00:15:12,033 --> 00:15:14,394
The thing will eventually get done, sort of by definition, right?

407
00:15:15,074 --> 00:15:18,295
Of course, the hard part is doing this and keep doing it

408
00:15:18,435 --> 00:15:20,895
and keeping your butt in the chair over the long haul

409
00:15:20,915 --> 00:15:23,616
that's required to ship the game and not getting distracted along the way

410
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:25,516
and dragging the process out way longer than it needs to be.

411
00:15:26,914 --> 00:15:29,615
But where do we go to get advice about how to keep

412
00:15:29,675 --> 00:15:30,935
our butt in the chair that long?

413
00:15:32,036 --> 00:15:33,016
Independent video game development

414
00:15:33,036 --> 00:15:34,036
is this rather new thing.

415
00:15:34,116 --> 00:15:35,217
Like, what can we even compare it to?

416
00:15:35,257 --> 00:15:37,638
What other creative process even requires

417
00:15:37,698 --> 00:15:39,798
like three years of sitting at the same desk

418
00:15:39,858 --> 00:15:41,199
doing the same project, right?

419
00:15:42,019 --> 00:15:44,100
It's a pretty crazy thing that doesn't have many parallels.

420
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:46,000
The closest thing that I could find to it

421
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:48,281
was writing, like writing novels or something, right?

422
00:15:48,621 --> 00:15:49,942
Like the writer just has to keep coming back

423
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:51,742
and writing the next bit of the novel over and over.

424
00:15:52,163 --> 00:15:55,184
So I took a look at a novelist who

425
00:15:55,204 --> 00:15:56,724
had an interesting technique, Roald Dahl.

426
00:15:57,698 --> 00:15:59,779
19 novels, very prolific guy, wrote a bunch of other stuff too.

427
00:15:59,799 --> 00:16:03,561
You guys are probably familiar mostly with his children's stories like Charlie and the

428
00:16:03,581 --> 00:16:05,682
Chocolate Factory and witches and Matilda and all that.

429
00:16:07,263 --> 00:16:11,145
But a really good writer and this is what he has to say in his own words about, and

430
00:16:11,165 --> 00:16:13,967
this is him sitting in his writing shed in his backyard.

431
00:16:13,987 --> 00:16:23,712
Well my work routine is very simple and it's always been the same for the last 45 years.

432
00:16:26,027 --> 00:16:30,569
The great thing, of course, is never to work for too long at a stretch,

433
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:37,812
because after about two hours, you are not at your highest peak of concentration,

434
00:16:38,512 --> 00:16:39,373
so you have to stop.

435
00:16:41,354 --> 00:16:44,095
Some writers choose certain times to work, others other times.

436
00:16:44,175 --> 00:16:47,576
It suits me to start rather late.

437
00:16:48,097 --> 00:16:51,998
I start at 10 o'clock in the morning, and I stop at 12.

438
00:16:53,699 --> 00:16:55,540
Always, however well I'm going.

439
00:16:56,615 --> 00:17:00,158
But I always stay there till 12, even if I'm a bit stuck.

440
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:05,262
You have to keep your bottom on the chair and stick it out.

441
00:17:06,544 --> 00:17:09,066
Otherwise, if you start getting in the habit of walking away

442
00:17:09,106 --> 00:17:10,847
when you're stuck, you'll never get it done.

443
00:17:12,348 --> 00:17:15,691
So Roald Dahl famously worked only two hours in the morning

444
00:17:15,831 --> 00:17:17,012
from 10 to 12, like he says.

445
00:17:17,132 --> 00:17:19,194
It also turns out that he worked in the evening for two hours

446
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:19,875
from 4 to 6.

447
00:17:20,775 --> 00:17:22,337
And that's all he'd ever let himself do.

448
00:17:22,537 --> 00:17:24,578
And he'd force himself to only write during that time.

449
00:17:24,985 --> 00:17:26,346
for a grand total of four hours a day,

450
00:17:26,406 --> 00:17:28,148
even though he was a very prolific writer.

451
00:17:28,668 --> 00:17:31,290
And it also sounds like he was very, very strict

452
00:17:31,310 --> 00:17:34,152
with himself about stopping when he told himself to stop.

453
00:17:34,192 --> 00:17:36,594
So that's tool number one in this sort of productivity

454
00:17:37,094 --> 00:17:39,216
renaissance suite of things, right?

455
00:17:39,736 --> 00:17:42,158
And it's a pretty simple one, limited focused work hours.

456
00:17:42,198 --> 00:17:44,140
Don't work all day, don't do these 12 hour things,

457
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:45,280
don't even work eight hours a day.

458
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,882
No one can be productive for all eight hours.

459
00:17:46,922 --> 00:17:48,263
Most people are wasting most of that time.

460
00:17:49,083 --> 00:17:50,965
Pick a focused, limited, doable work hours.

461
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,718
In my case, I picked five hours.

462
00:17:52,758 --> 00:17:54,759
I think four hours maybe for a writer,

463
00:17:54,999 --> 00:17:56,220
because it's pure creativity.

464
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:59,701
There's some kind of rote engineering tasks

465
00:17:59,741 --> 00:18:00,581
and other things that need to be done

466
00:18:00,601 --> 00:18:01,321
when you're making a game,

467
00:18:01,401 --> 00:18:02,922
so five hours is pretty good.

468
00:18:02,942 --> 00:18:03,842
You can pick your own amount.

469
00:18:04,322 --> 00:18:06,863
Mine is from eight to one, Monday through Friday only,

470
00:18:06,903 --> 00:18:07,603
never on the weekends.

471
00:18:08,064 --> 00:18:09,764
And some more details about what this means, right?

472
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:11,625
We say I'm gonna start working at eight.

473
00:18:11,905 --> 00:18:12,805
You start working at eight.

474
00:18:13,245 --> 00:18:15,326
You don't sit down and warm up for an hour and a half

475
00:18:15,426 --> 00:18:16,807
by checking the New York Times

476
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:20,088
or checking Reddit or whatever, looking at Twitter.

477
00:18:20,538 --> 00:18:21,458
you actually start working.

478
00:18:22,759 --> 00:18:24,980
And you decide what counts as work up front.

479
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,041
You say, oh, today I'm programming,

480
00:18:27,081 --> 00:18:28,481
or today I'm working on art, or today I'm

481
00:18:28,501 --> 00:18:29,842
working on the website, or today I'm

482
00:18:30,322 --> 00:18:32,083
trying to get in touch with journalists, whatever it is.

483
00:18:32,763 --> 00:18:33,724
And you only do that task.

484
00:18:33,744 --> 00:18:36,445
You don't get in the middle of your level design task

485
00:18:36,485 --> 00:18:40,687
and then go off and email some fans or something in response

486
00:18:40,707 --> 00:18:42,708
to them or whatever else you want to do.

487
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,641
And during this time when you're working on a task,

488
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:47,422
you don't check email, look at the news, forums, Discord,

489
00:18:47,462 --> 00:18:49,404
Reddit, interacting with players, shopping,

490
00:18:49,424 --> 00:18:51,145
looking up random things, wandering away, calling

491
00:18:51,185 --> 00:18:51,965
your mother, whatever.

492
00:18:52,265 --> 00:18:54,447
You just don't do that stuff then at all.

493
00:18:54,487 --> 00:18:55,367
You just forbid yourself.

494
00:18:57,008 --> 00:18:58,409
And you stop at the appointed time,

495
00:18:58,429 --> 00:19:01,831
which I'm calling the truly hard part.

496
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:04,313
So a couple of tips.

497
00:19:04,353 --> 00:19:07,314
How do you avoid Reddit or Twitter

498
00:19:07,354 --> 00:19:09,656
or whatever it is that is your main distraction of choice?

499
00:19:10,837 --> 00:19:14,438
Some people literally need to disconnect the Wi-Fi router in the house while they're working.

500
00:19:14,919 --> 00:19:18,820
Of course, we want to look up stuff about what we're working on sometimes, and so that's

501
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:19,521
not that convenient.

502
00:19:19,961 --> 00:19:24,022
But I think if you're working limited hours, it's much easier because you can say, I'm

503
00:19:24,042 --> 00:19:25,423
going to stop at one.

504
00:19:26,043 --> 00:19:29,345
I can go look up at, I can spend as much time on Reddit as, I can find out who won the Oscars

505
00:19:30,465 --> 00:19:31,265
after one, right?

506
00:19:31,325 --> 00:19:35,327
Like I'm free, I don't, I can be guilt-free and spend several hours on Reddit if I want

507
00:19:35,347 --> 00:19:36,688
to get the whole rest of the day, right?

508
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:39,945
And that helps us get over this,

509
00:19:40,005 --> 00:19:41,586
like, oh, I need to look this up now.

510
00:19:41,866 --> 00:19:43,968
The other thing is to keep a non-work list next to your desk.

511
00:19:44,668 --> 00:19:46,449
These are the things that is tickling my brain right now

512
00:19:46,489 --> 00:19:47,690
that I feel like I wanna go look up.

513
00:19:48,251 --> 00:19:50,072
And I forgot to look up or I forgot to do

514
00:19:50,132 --> 00:19:52,073
or I need to go check this or I need to email that person

515
00:19:52,113 --> 00:19:53,815
or whatever it is that's not work stuff.

516
00:19:54,375 --> 00:19:55,576
You write that down on this list

517
00:19:55,636 --> 00:19:56,536
and then once you're free,

518
00:19:56,637 --> 00:19:58,158
after your big solid chunk of work,

519
00:19:58,478 --> 00:20:00,459
you're like, ah, now I'm free to go do these fun things

520
00:20:00,499 --> 00:20:01,460
that I wrote down on my list.

521
00:20:02,260 --> 00:20:03,621
So why is quitting the hard part?

522
00:20:05,102 --> 00:20:06,403
Once you get going, it's really hard to stop.

523
00:20:07,044 --> 00:20:08,844
And Roald Dahl says he forces himself to stop.

524
00:20:09,205 --> 00:20:10,425
It's hard because of flow.

525
00:20:10,885 --> 00:20:12,585
And we often, as game designers, we love flow.

526
00:20:12,625 --> 00:20:14,446
We seek it in our designs.

527
00:20:15,066 --> 00:20:18,327
And it's this great thing where you kind of fall into the work

528
00:20:18,367 --> 00:20:19,527
and you lose yourself and so on.

529
00:20:19,887 --> 00:20:21,967
One of the hallmarks of flow is losing track of time.

530
00:20:22,908 --> 00:20:25,448
So I think flow as a benefit for a creative process

531
00:20:25,468 --> 00:20:28,969
is a bit of a fallacy, because losing track of time

532
00:20:29,009 --> 00:20:30,609
is enjoyable, like it's great.

533
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,830
But enjoyable isn't the same thing as productive.

534
00:20:33,974 --> 00:20:36,354
And I think a lot of people use flow, myself included,

535
00:20:36,394 --> 00:20:38,515
as a crutch to keep going, to avoid procrastinating.

536
00:20:38,835 --> 00:20:40,616
Like if I can only get started on this thing and get going,

537
00:20:40,636 --> 00:20:42,696
I don't want to stop because I actually have momentum

538
00:20:42,736 --> 00:20:44,577
right now and I'm not looking at Reddit or whatever it is.

539
00:20:45,998 --> 00:20:48,198
But you maybe don't need that if you have other ways

540
00:20:48,238 --> 00:20:48,938
to stay on track.

541
00:20:49,379 --> 00:20:50,719
Because you want to consciously choose

542
00:20:50,759 --> 00:20:51,659
how you spend your time, right?

543
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:52,840
You don't want to go around the rabbit hole

544
00:20:52,860 --> 00:20:55,601
and some one weird problem or polishing one sprite

545
00:20:55,641 --> 00:20:57,481
and then realize two hours have gone by

546
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:59,522
and be like, was it even worth that much time?

547
00:21:01,090 --> 00:21:03,150
You want to pay attention to where your time is going,

548
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:04,791
how much time your current task is consuming,

549
00:21:04,811 --> 00:21:06,691
and make choices about whether to keep going.

550
00:21:07,152 --> 00:21:08,612
And that's where this comes in.

551
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:10,653
I've got one up here, timing my talk.

552
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:12,753
It may go off a little bit before the end.

553
00:21:13,854 --> 00:21:15,934
But a kitchen timer, a physical kitchen timer,

554
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:17,075
not a digital timer.

555
00:21:18,355 --> 00:21:21,676
And you use this to periodically wake yourself up

556
00:21:21,756 --> 00:21:23,817
out of flow in a very tactile and auditory way.

557
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,918
And the idea of a kitchen timer for productivity

558
00:21:26,958 --> 00:21:28,338
comes from the Pomodoro method, which

559
00:21:28,358 --> 00:21:29,758
I'm sure some people in the room are familiar with.

560
00:21:30,613 --> 00:21:33,394
But the Pomodoro method is about breaking your workday

561
00:21:33,494 --> 00:21:35,716
up into these little chunks and deciding what to do

562
00:21:35,756 --> 00:21:37,416
for each chunk individually and taking breaks

563
00:21:37,436 --> 00:21:38,077
between the chunks.

564
00:21:39,858 --> 00:21:41,418
But this really helps you pay attention

565
00:21:41,438 --> 00:21:43,079
to where your time is going, pay attention

566
00:21:43,099 --> 00:21:43,879
to how much time you spend

567
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:44,940
on the current thing you're working on.

568
00:21:44,960 --> 00:21:47,381
Like, oh my gosh, I was cleaning up the edge of that sprite

569
00:21:47,421 --> 00:21:48,522
and it took a whole half hour.

570
00:21:48,542 --> 00:21:49,822
I thought it was only going to take five minutes.

571
00:21:50,163 --> 00:21:52,504
Like I better like, you know, quickly finish that and get

572
00:21:52,544 --> 00:21:53,224
on to the next thing.

573
00:21:53,644 --> 00:21:55,385
Come up for air, right, break out of flow.

574
00:21:55,685 --> 00:21:58,066
Get a chance to get a better perspective and get out of the,

575
00:21:58,106 --> 00:21:59,627
climb out of the rabbit hole for a little bit.

576
00:22:00,194 --> 00:22:03,136
And even more important, taking regular breaks

577
00:22:03,216 --> 00:22:04,157
and getting up out of the chair

578
00:22:04,817 --> 00:22:06,098
is because sitting is killing you, right?

579
00:22:06,639 --> 00:22:08,640
I don't know if, probably a lot of people in this room

580
00:22:08,660 --> 00:22:10,781
have read the recent research on the health effects

581
00:22:10,822 --> 00:22:11,602
of long-term sitting.

582
00:22:12,323 --> 00:22:14,504
I definitely have personal problems with my legs

583
00:22:14,544 --> 00:22:16,125
and circulation after sitting for so many years.

584
00:22:16,706 --> 00:22:18,887
And it's taking years off your life,

585
00:22:18,927 --> 00:22:21,189
and this is a sitting industry, a sitting endeavor, right?

586
00:22:21,229 --> 00:22:22,890
Sitting at a computer, making stuff on computers.

587
00:22:24,471 --> 00:22:25,251
It's really bad for you.

588
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,973
So getting up regularly out of that chair,

589
00:22:28,093 --> 00:22:28,894
away from the screen.

590
00:22:29,467 --> 00:22:31,168
Also giving your eyes a rest and other things, right?

591
00:22:31,988 --> 00:22:33,329
And so that's the second tool, right?

592
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:34,409
Get up every 30 minutes.

593
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:35,469
Set this timer to go off.

594
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:38,410
And every 30 minutes, you do a stretch.

595
00:22:38,430 --> 00:22:39,210
You go get some water.

596
00:22:39,250 --> 00:22:40,651
You walk just down the hall, whatever.

597
00:22:40,931 --> 00:22:41,731
It's not a long break.

598
00:22:42,171 --> 00:22:45,192
And then every hour, what I do is I go out, literally out

599
00:22:45,212 --> 00:22:46,833
of the house, and go for a walk around the block

600
00:22:47,893 --> 00:22:49,354
for a little bit more of an extended break,

601
00:22:49,394 --> 00:22:51,255
get circulation going, clear my head,

602
00:22:51,295 --> 00:22:53,255
be outside for a little bit instead of inside all day,

603
00:22:53,795 --> 00:22:55,156
which is actually really amazing.

604
00:22:55,276 --> 00:22:56,376
Like, outside is amazing.

605
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:01,481
And it also helps me with the things I'm working on,

606
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:03,882
because I get a fresh perspective on this hard problem

607
00:23:03,902 --> 00:23:05,022
I've been working on for a whole hour.

608
00:23:05,403 --> 00:23:06,343
Maybe I'm stuck on something,

609
00:23:06,363 --> 00:23:07,303
I don't know how to fix this thing,

610
00:23:07,323 --> 00:23:09,204
or I don't know how I'm gonna get this artwork working,

611
00:23:09,224 --> 00:23:09,804
or whatever it is,

612
00:23:10,324 --> 00:23:13,045
and going out and walking for a few minutes,

613
00:23:13,486 --> 00:23:14,726
like, oh, all of a sudden,

614
00:23:14,746 --> 00:23:16,007
sometimes the solution will come to me, right?

615
00:23:16,027 --> 00:23:18,067
The quiet of being out there in a different environment.

616
00:23:18,648 --> 00:23:20,268
A couple words about stopping, right?

617
00:23:20,728 --> 00:23:22,529
Like, it's hard to stop, I said that before,

618
00:23:22,809 --> 00:23:23,970
and you kinda feel like you shouldn't stop

619
00:23:24,010 --> 00:23:24,590
if you're on a roll,

620
00:23:24,610 --> 00:23:25,850
I'm getting stuff done today, actually.

621
00:23:26,304 --> 00:23:28,686
But if you've been super productive for five solid hours,

622
00:23:28,846 --> 00:23:31,408
like you can stop, you deserve to stop, you should stop.

623
00:23:32,008 --> 00:23:33,449
You're definitely not at your highest peak anymore.

624
00:23:33,509 --> 00:23:34,890
You're making more mistakes and all that stuff,

625
00:23:34,910 --> 00:23:36,171
like what Roald Dahl is talking about.

626
00:23:36,852 --> 00:23:39,634
But you should also be doing other things

627
00:23:39,674 --> 00:23:41,015
with your life every day, right?

628
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,377
Like having hobbies, spending time with friends and family,

629
00:23:43,497 --> 00:23:45,738
sleeping and eating well, having time to dream,

630
00:23:46,199 --> 00:23:48,100
you know, doing other things, right?

631
00:23:48,781 --> 00:23:50,242
You know, this is a creative endeavor, right?

632
00:23:50,262 --> 00:23:51,983
And we need to kind of, you know,

633
00:23:52,103 --> 00:23:54,144
let the dog off the chain and feed it some meat

634
00:23:54,164 --> 00:23:55,265
every once in a while, right?

635
00:23:56,219 --> 00:23:59,761
So, and if you haven't tried drone racing, you really should.

636
00:24:01,402 --> 00:24:04,224
But okay, so that's this process, right?

637
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:07,606
But we still have this deal, thing we have to deal with, which is the complexity of what

638
00:24:07,626 --> 00:24:08,246
we're doing, right?

639
00:24:08,626 --> 00:24:12,048
So, games are some of the most complicated engineering projects in existence, with all

640
00:24:12,068 --> 00:24:14,530
the working parts that it takes to make something.

641
00:24:15,710 --> 00:24:18,552
And how do we, like, cut our way through this thicket, right?

642
00:24:18,592 --> 00:24:20,273
Like One Hour in Life is a perfect example of this.

643
00:24:20,293 --> 00:24:22,555
I mean, so many moving parts, I can't even remember all of them now.

644
00:24:23,283 --> 00:24:24,664
There's all these different servers and scripts

645
00:24:24,684 --> 00:24:26,325
to keep the servers updated and all this kind of stuff.

646
00:24:26,345 --> 00:24:28,326
Like, how do I even figure out what to do next?

647
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:30,307
How do I figure out what to start working on at 8 AM?

648
00:24:30,948 --> 00:24:32,288
And I use this tool.

649
00:24:32,328 --> 00:24:33,689
And I think it's the best tool in existence

650
00:24:33,929 --> 00:24:36,631
for this, which is paper notes.

651
00:24:38,272 --> 00:24:39,333
So first of all, why not digital?

652
00:24:39,353 --> 00:24:40,894
A lot of people want to use some kind of digital tool

653
00:24:40,914 --> 00:24:42,014
to track their process.

654
00:24:43,015 --> 00:24:44,876
Paper is actually way faster than digital.

655
00:24:45,797 --> 00:24:46,697
You can draw diagrams.

656
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:47,598
You can cross stuff out.

657
00:24:47,618 --> 00:24:48,999
You can jot down something really quickly.

658
00:24:49,599 --> 00:24:51,560
And note that this is not a notebook, right?

659
00:24:51,915 --> 00:24:53,537
These are loose three-hole punch sheets,

660
00:24:53,997 --> 00:24:55,398
and you can flip through them quickly.

661
00:24:55,438 --> 00:24:56,899
You can reorder pages at will.

662
00:24:56,959 --> 00:24:58,380
You can make a stack and put things

663
00:24:58,400 --> 00:24:59,801
that aren't so important on the bottom of the stack,

664
00:24:59,861 --> 00:25:01,743
bring the most important tasks to the top of the stack.

665
00:25:02,343 --> 00:25:05,225
And you can pull a page out and put it on your desk

666
00:25:05,265 --> 00:25:07,407
or pull three pages out and spread them out on your desk.

667
00:25:07,607 --> 00:25:08,408
You're not sitting there fighting

668
00:25:08,428 --> 00:25:10,209
with some notebook that's trying to close on you all the time.

669
00:25:10,749 --> 00:25:12,771
And the finished notes can get out of your way.

670
00:25:12,791 --> 00:25:13,732
You don't have to flip through them

671
00:25:13,772 --> 00:25:14,732
every time you look through the notebook.

672
00:25:15,173 --> 00:25:16,454
They are going down.

673
00:25:16,494 --> 00:25:18,075
I have this little section up here,

674
00:25:18,115 --> 00:25:19,856
which is finished, a page that sticks out.

675
00:25:19,876 --> 00:25:21,337
And it's all torn up because I've used it so much.

676
00:25:21,735 --> 00:25:24,357
But the finished notes, I've decided I'm done with this page.

677
00:25:24,377 --> 00:25:25,298
I don't need to look at it anymore.

678
00:25:25,378 --> 00:25:25,858
Go under there.

679
00:25:25,878 --> 00:25:29,221
And eventually, if that stack gets thick enough down there,

680
00:25:29,241 --> 00:25:31,022
you can move it into the recycle bin,

681
00:25:31,042 --> 00:25:32,863
or you can put it in a three-ring binder

682
00:25:32,883 --> 00:25:34,585
if you want to save it, or a filing cabinet.

683
00:25:35,445 --> 00:25:36,366
So that's tool number three.

684
00:25:37,547 --> 00:25:39,248
Loose sheets, keep them on a clipboard

685
00:25:39,268 --> 00:25:40,329
to keep it from getting too messy,

686
00:25:41,090 --> 00:25:43,612
and file away unfinished sheets, and have a pen handy

687
00:25:43,652 --> 00:25:44,913
to write down what you want to do.

688
00:25:45,453 --> 00:25:48,175
And at the end of the day, or toward the end of your five

689
00:25:48,215 --> 00:25:48,656
hours, you.

690
00:25:49,098 --> 00:25:50,979
write down several things that you want to work on tomorrow

691
00:25:51,019 --> 00:25:53,279
to get yourself started, and that's at the top of the stack.

692
00:25:53,339 --> 00:25:54,920
And then once you're done with that, it just disappears.

693
00:25:56,380 --> 00:25:59,401
So those are these three tools that I

694
00:25:59,441 --> 00:26:02,802
think are really important and really help me to consistently

695
00:26:02,842 --> 00:26:03,482
ship games.

696
00:26:03,522 --> 00:26:04,482
And I think if you use them, you'll

697
00:26:04,502 --> 00:26:06,242
be able to ship as many games as you want throughout your life,

698
00:26:07,103 --> 00:26:09,223
while maintaining, of course, mental and physical health,

699
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:12,144
and not ending up shaking in bed thinking you're dying.

700
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:15,384
But there's a problem.

701
00:26:15,525 --> 00:26:16,725
I'm giving you this method.

702
00:26:16,745 --> 00:26:17,505
I hand it to you today.

703
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:18,885
You walk away feeling inspired.

704
00:26:19,314 --> 00:26:22,575
maybe more or less inspired than you felt by the video,

705
00:26:22,615 --> 00:26:23,796
the Just Do It video at the beginning.

706
00:26:24,796 --> 00:26:26,716
But we don't stick with methods that we start, right?

707
00:26:27,337 --> 00:26:29,437
Here are Google searches for the term nutrition

708
00:26:29,737 --> 00:26:30,538
by week of the year.

709
00:26:31,878 --> 00:26:33,739
If you look closely, you can see there's a big spike

710
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,179
around New Year's resolution time.

711
00:26:35,659 --> 00:26:37,620
And then interesting nutrition trails off

712
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:40,461
until it drastically tanks around the next holidays

713
00:26:40,501 --> 00:26:41,741
when people don't care about nutrition at all.

714
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:43,402
And then they wake up on New Year's Day

715
00:26:43,422 --> 00:26:44,782
and try to search for nutrition again.

716
00:26:45,272 --> 00:26:47,453
So people, we just generally don't stick with new things, right?

717
00:26:47,573 --> 00:26:52,374
And you kind of know you want to, you've decided to, there's this temporary renaissance, but

718
00:26:52,394 --> 00:26:55,195
then these old habits creep in, and then you start feeling guilty, right?

719
00:26:55,255 --> 00:26:58,576
You're like, ah, I knew I wanted to keep up with that thing, and I didn't, I'm not doing

720
00:26:58,596 --> 00:27:02,177
it anymore, I went two days without doing it, and that guilt makes you feel negative

721
00:27:02,197 --> 00:27:04,178
towards the method, and you kind of ditch the method.

722
00:27:04,218 --> 00:27:05,398
It wasn't for me, it didn't work for me.

723
00:27:09,055 --> 00:27:12,596
So how do you do it long enough to make it habitual, right?

724
00:27:12,716 --> 00:27:14,817
And this final trick comes, again, from a writer,

725
00:27:14,857 --> 00:27:15,917
this time from Jerry Seinfeld.

726
00:27:16,737 --> 00:27:18,618
So he calls this method don't break the chain,

727
00:27:19,518 --> 00:27:22,339
where he got a big wall calendar with the entire year on one

728
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,719
page with all the months.

729
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:25,580
And they have small ones now that you can download.

730
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:27,280
If you look up don't break the chain calendar online,

731
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,161
you'll find all these PDF files for different years.

732
00:27:29,761 --> 00:27:30,981
And it has the entire year on one sheet.

733
00:27:31,021 --> 00:27:32,162
You hang it in a visible place.

734
00:27:32,982 --> 00:27:34,402
And you give yourself a red X.

735
00:27:34,885 --> 00:27:37,086
for every day that you keep whatever habit it is that you want.

736
00:27:37,106 --> 00:27:39,428
I mean, this can work for exercise or eating healthy or whatever too.

737
00:27:39,888 --> 00:27:42,070
But in my case, it's like if I get up at 8 a.m.

738
00:27:42,510 --> 00:27:45,792
and I start working at 8 a.m. without looking at Reddit or whatever other distraction,

739
00:27:46,113 --> 00:27:50,175
and I take my regular breaks and I work through the entire five hours without doing anything else,

740
00:27:50,556 --> 00:27:51,496
I give myself a red X.

741
00:27:51,897 --> 00:27:55,319
I've also given myself green circles here for things like days I'm taking off for real.

742
00:27:55,339 --> 00:27:58,941
Like I decided I'm taking a family trip or, you know, taking a day off for Thanksgiving.

743
00:27:59,730 --> 00:28:02,633
And knowing that you're going to show the calendar to GDC

744
00:28:02,673 --> 00:28:04,154
in public really helps.

745
00:28:06,096 --> 00:28:07,918
You can see, though, there's one little embarrassment there.

746
00:28:07,938 --> 00:28:11,241
On December 13, that's the day I decided

747
00:28:11,281 --> 00:28:12,803
I should spend just a few minutes researching

748
00:28:12,843 --> 00:28:13,544
cryptocurrency.

749
00:28:16,467 --> 00:28:18,008
And maybe two days later, I actually

750
00:28:18,068 --> 00:28:21,512
owned a part of a Bitcoin or something, right?

751
00:28:21,752 --> 00:28:21,952
So.

752
00:28:23,991 --> 00:28:25,291
And once you get a chain of red X's,

753
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,812
you try to keep them going as long as possible.

754
00:28:26,852 --> 00:28:28,452
And it's just one day at a time, right?

755
00:28:28,472 --> 00:28:29,293
It's just one more red X.

756
00:28:29,333 --> 00:28:31,753
It's just like, you know, you're taking one step at a time.

757
00:28:31,793 --> 00:28:32,653
So that's the method, right?

758
00:28:32,994 --> 00:28:35,794
Stupid simple, strict regular, limited work hours,

759
00:28:36,735 --> 00:28:38,315
regularly scheduled breaks that use a timer

760
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,255
to wake up and remember the break,

761
00:28:40,996 --> 00:28:42,196
stack of paper notes to keep track

762
00:28:42,216 --> 00:28:44,036
of this complicated process,

763
00:28:44,056 --> 00:28:46,357
and keep it all going by not breaking the chain.

764
00:28:47,257 --> 00:28:48,838
Okay, so finally, results.

765
00:28:49,601 --> 00:28:50,442
from this method for me.

766
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:53,244
So before, when I was crunching, doing this crazy crunch,

767
00:28:53,284 --> 00:28:55,286
line of code per hour of day, and this, I said,

768
00:28:55,326 --> 00:28:56,267
was a very depressing graph.

769
00:28:56,287 --> 00:28:57,488
Look at my morning productivity.

770
00:28:57,548 --> 00:28:58,068
It's awful.

771
00:28:59,289 --> 00:29:01,591
Look at my even 9 PM and 8 PM productivity.

772
00:29:02,672 --> 00:29:04,173
After I implemented these methods,

773
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:07,416
my lines of code per hour of day looks like this, right?

774
00:29:07,456 --> 00:29:10,179
So that's a much healthier looking morning work routine.

775
00:29:11,199 --> 00:29:12,561
I'm still kind of scrambling at 1 PM

776
00:29:12,601 --> 00:29:14,422
as my day comes to an end to get a lot done or whatever.

777
00:29:14,782 --> 00:29:17,562
And I do work into the afternoon sometimes when I shouldn't.

778
00:29:17,622 --> 00:29:19,122
I know I'm still working on that.

779
00:29:19,222 --> 00:29:20,583
Stopping is the hard part, like I said.

780
00:29:21,323 --> 00:29:21,823
Days of the week.

781
00:29:22,323 --> 00:29:24,103
So during crunch, it was this awful graph.

782
00:29:24,123 --> 00:29:27,244
Look at Wednesday, less than half productivity on that day.

783
00:29:28,124 --> 00:29:30,985
After, oh, half hour is over.

784
00:29:31,245 --> 00:29:31,885
Time to take a break.

785
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:36,826
After the productivity renaissance kind of methods

786
00:29:36,846 --> 00:29:38,806
were installed, you can see it's a much healthier looking

787
00:29:39,086 --> 00:29:41,867
all week long productivity with Tuesday being my best day.

788
00:29:44,293 --> 00:29:44,973
Don't break the chain.

789
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,036
Stop when you said you're going to stop.

790
00:29:55,122 --> 00:29:55,962
So I don't know.

791
00:29:55,982 --> 00:30:00,306
I mean, I'm kind of at the end of the allotted time here.

792
00:30:00,386 --> 00:30:02,768
But we can kind of go over a tiny bit for some questions.

793
00:30:03,508 --> 00:30:04,229
Just one quick one.

794
00:30:04,449 --> 00:30:04,609
Yes.

795
00:30:05,029 --> 00:30:06,611
Why don't you work Saturdays and Sundays?

796
00:30:06,991 --> 00:30:09,933
I love that time as before the rest of the family gets up.

797
00:30:11,272 --> 00:30:16,457
three or four hours. I'm up at 4 30 every day. So I love the 4 30 to 9 before they get up on weekends.

798
00:30:16,597 --> 00:30:21,982
So yeah, it's a good question. Um, I guess, you know, I do sleep on Saturday and Sundays,

799
00:30:22,283 --> 00:30:27,368
pretty much as long as my kids do. Um, and so, yeah, I get up and do stuff with them usually.

800
00:30:27,408 --> 00:30:30,210
So that, I mean, I, it's kind of like, yeah, Saturday and Sunday is the time they spend with

801
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:33,874
me really. Um, so in my family, that's just the way it works. I can see how sometimes.

802
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:35,994
if your sleep schedule is different than theirs.

803
00:30:36,574 --> 00:30:38,235
Your kids are probably younger, so that's...

804
00:30:38,435 --> 00:30:40,136
Yeah, I mean, my oldest is 14, my youngest is 7.

805
00:30:40,176 --> 00:30:40,496
Yeah.

806
00:30:40,876 --> 00:30:42,737
You know, I gotta get up and play League of Legends with them, right?

807
00:30:43,917 --> 00:30:44,157
So...

808
00:30:44,277 --> 00:30:45,698
Thanks. Great talk.

809
00:30:46,078 --> 00:30:48,219
Yeah, thank you, man.

810
00:30:48,859 --> 00:30:53,020
So, all your data is based on lines of code, right?

811
00:30:53,441 --> 00:30:56,322
Did you count the sprite work, like...

812
00:30:56,842 --> 00:31:00,363
Yeah, so, yes, this is all based on lines of code, and it's very...

813
00:31:01,885 --> 00:31:04,265
it's very sort of biased and kind of unbalanced

814
00:31:04,305 --> 00:31:04,925
because of that, right?

815
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,366
Like there's all sorts of other things I'm doing,

816
00:31:06,406 --> 00:31:07,866
like I'm working on the website,

817
00:31:07,986 --> 00:31:11,747
or I'm making, being interviewed to promote the game,

818
00:31:11,787 --> 00:31:13,267
or whatever, those things count as work, right?

819
00:31:13,287 --> 00:31:14,527
And this doesn't cover any of that,

820
00:31:14,547 --> 00:31:15,587
it doesn't cover the artwork either.

821
00:31:15,707 --> 00:31:17,948
So I'm not, there's not a good way to analyze

822
00:31:18,008 --> 00:31:20,869
what number of megabytes of images created or something.

823
00:31:21,329 --> 00:31:22,229
I guess I could do that too.

824
00:31:22,509 --> 00:31:24,149
And there's also music that was created,

825
00:31:24,189 --> 00:31:25,629
like how do I analyze that number of minutes?

826
00:31:25,649 --> 00:31:27,210
You know, it's like a separate graph.

827
00:31:27,350 --> 00:31:28,850
And those things usually,

828
00:31:30,358 --> 00:31:33,821
I mean, coding is sort of the thing that sort of carries throughout the whole project and

829
00:31:33,861 --> 00:31:38,464
sometimes maybe I'll spend a week making music, but then I've spent like, you know, a month

830
00:31:38,504 --> 00:31:39,965
or two writing the music engine, right?

831
00:31:40,245 --> 00:31:44,288
So you know, it's, I think, I don't know, I picked one, I picked the easiest one.

832
00:31:45,209 --> 00:31:46,570
And I'm not sure about the other stuff.

833
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:49,392
Hi, my name's Jeremiah.

834
00:31:49,432 --> 00:31:49,892
This is dope.

835
00:31:50,352 --> 00:31:50,973
Thank you so much.

836
00:31:52,394 --> 00:31:52,554
So

837
00:31:53,551 --> 00:31:56,612
I have a day job and then I have my creative awesomeness.

838
00:31:57,452 --> 00:32:01,314
How would you change up this model for that type of thing

839
00:32:01,334 --> 00:32:04,095
where you have to balance one and the other?

840
00:32:04,115 --> 00:32:06,496
Yeah, that's really tough.

841
00:32:07,596 --> 00:32:09,137
I haven't done that for a long time myself.

842
00:32:09,457 --> 00:32:11,637
I guess the last time was back when I was in grad school or something

843
00:32:11,677 --> 00:32:13,158
where I had these school responsibilities

844
00:32:13,218 --> 00:32:14,939
and still was trying to keep creative projects going.

845
00:32:14,959 --> 00:32:17,660
So I know it's really tough.

846
00:32:17,700 --> 00:32:20,661
I have other friends who are working and trying to ship games at the same time.

847
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:22,134
It's a real struggle.

848
00:32:22,174 --> 00:32:26,017
I mean, basically, the reality is you can only get so much productivity out of yourself

849
00:32:26,737 --> 00:32:27,277
in a given week.

850
00:32:27,657 --> 00:32:31,059
And, really, I think probably lowering your expectations about how much you're going to

851
00:32:31,079 --> 00:32:34,781
get done in your own projects on the weekend, which is really when you should be...

852
00:32:34,801 --> 00:32:39,584
I mean, if you come home from work after eight hours spent and exhausted, you should be relaxing,

853
00:32:39,644 --> 00:32:40,825
you should be kicking back.

854
00:32:41,570 --> 00:32:43,571
Hang out with friends, eating dinner, going to bed early,

855
00:32:43,611 --> 00:32:44,151
and that kind of stuff.

856
00:32:44,171 --> 00:32:46,392
Not trying to crunch on your own game in the middle,

857
00:32:46,432 --> 00:32:48,493
late at night, and going to work tired the next day.

858
00:32:49,413 --> 00:32:50,694
So weekends is probably it.

859
00:32:51,294 --> 00:32:53,215
And be real realistic about making

860
00:32:53,235 --> 00:32:54,676
sure you have plenty of leisure time in the weekend.

861
00:32:54,756 --> 00:32:56,737
Maybe Sunday afternoon only.

862
00:32:57,397 --> 00:32:57,957
It's really tough.

863
00:32:58,037 --> 00:32:58,378
I don't know.

864
00:32:58,758 --> 00:33:03,200
But don't beat yourself up about like, that's the trap, I think,

865
00:33:03,260 --> 00:33:04,380
is that you get into this.

866
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:07,122
Some of my friends, I definitely see this happening with them.

867
00:33:07,142 --> 00:33:09,243
You get into this, I didn't work on my game for a whole month.

868
00:33:10,225 --> 00:33:12,406
I feel terrible, and every time I think about it,

869
00:33:12,446 --> 00:33:13,747
it makes me feel terrible, and I just

870
00:33:14,347 --> 00:33:15,668
don't even want to think about it for a while.

871
00:33:15,748 --> 00:33:17,029
And then you just kind of get away from it,

872
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:19,090
and then it becomes even harder to get back to it.

873
00:33:19,490 --> 00:33:23,813
So picking a sane and doable amount of work

874
00:33:24,773 --> 00:33:27,275
and sticking with it so you feel good after each time,

875
00:33:27,375 --> 00:33:28,376
and then you reinforce this.

876
00:33:28,856 --> 00:33:30,437
I felt good after Sunday afternoon.

877
00:33:31,017 --> 00:33:32,338
Next Sunday afternoon, I'll feel good again.

878
00:33:32,398 --> 00:33:33,839
And you get this positive reinforcement

879
00:33:33,879 --> 00:33:35,800
as opposed to beating yourself up

880
00:33:35,860 --> 00:33:37,081
and feeling like a failure, right?

881
00:33:37,341 --> 00:33:39,582
So that's the only advice I can give there.

882
00:33:41,514 --> 00:33:46,782
Okay, that graph was amazing, the one that you showed the timeline of the whole project.

883
00:33:48,644 --> 00:33:53,491
After you had that breakdown, why did you come back to the project?

884
00:33:57,570 --> 00:33:58,530
What brought you back as well?

885
00:33:58,590 --> 00:34:01,012
Yeah, so I have financial realities.

886
00:34:01,032 --> 00:34:03,194
You know, I'm a career independent game developer

887
00:34:03,234 --> 00:34:04,735
supporting a spouse and three children.

888
00:34:05,876 --> 00:34:07,156
And, you know, we're trying to buy a house

889
00:34:07,216 --> 00:34:09,278
in Davis, California, which is not cheap at all.

890
00:34:10,279 --> 00:34:12,360
And so we've been saving up for it for like seven years

891
00:34:12,440 --> 00:34:13,821
and still renting seven years later

892
00:34:13,861 --> 00:34:15,903
when we thought we'd be in our own house by now.

893
00:34:15,943 --> 00:34:18,144
And so, you know, my family's really depending

894
00:34:18,224 --> 00:34:19,405
on the project, right?

895
00:34:19,785 --> 00:34:21,607
That's another reason why it was so stressful

896
00:34:21,667 --> 00:34:23,348
is because when my friend came on board,

897
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:25,789
I was paying him effectively a stipend

898
00:34:25,829 --> 00:34:26,870
or a salary during that time.

899
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,042
And so all this money kind of went out the window

900
00:34:29,062 --> 00:34:31,043
to my wife's chagrin.

901
00:34:31,083 --> 00:34:32,944
And once I finally decided we weren't gonna work together

902
00:34:32,964 --> 00:34:34,845
anymore, it's like a year not only of time,

903
00:34:35,226 --> 00:34:36,266
but of money wasted, right?

904
00:34:36,326 --> 00:34:38,008
Like those were our savings from previous games

905
00:34:38,028 --> 00:34:39,088
that we were almost, like we can't even

906
00:34:39,128 --> 00:34:39,969
pay another year's rent now.

907
00:34:40,009 --> 00:34:40,549
What are we gonna do?

908
00:34:40,609 --> 00:34:41,930
Like, so all those pressures were on me.

909
00:34:42,270 --> 00:34:43,671
Not only that, I forgot to mention I was turning 40

910
00:34:43,852 --> 00:34:44,732
right around that time.

911
00:34:46,013 --> 00:34:48,174
So, like, and my child had just gone through puberty

912
00:34:48,194 --> 00:34:49,475
and he's like six foot three now.

913
00:34:49,495 --> 00:34:51,136
You know, all these things were like.

914
00:34:51,799 --> 00:34:53,160
Things were changing, things were happening.

915
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,602
My friend of 25 years, but still, I couldn't stop.

916
00:34:57,642 --> 00:34:59,322
This game I'd worked on almost three years now,

917
00:34:59,362 --> 00:35:00,003
I had to ship it.

918
00:35:00,143 --> 00:35:01,203
It was a good game.

919
00:35:01,243 --> 00:35:02,764
I think it was a good game, it was worth shipping.

920
00:35:03,004 --> 00:35:04,725
You hadn't lost faith in the game.

921
00:35:05,025 --> 00:35:06,125
No, I hadn't, no.

922
00:35:07,066 --> 00:35:09,167
But I realized that for such a big project,

923
00:35:09,187 --> 00:35:12,288
I needed a new, a breath of fresh air

924
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:14,329
in terms of the way I was gonna be managing it

925
00:35:14,589 --> 00:35:15,209
from here on out.

926
00:35:16,410 --> 00:35:16,630
Thanks.

927
00:35:16,930 --> 00:35:19,291
All right, it looks like that's it.

928
00:35:19,891 --> 00:35:20,231
Excellent.

929
00:35:20,531 --> 00:35:20,951
Thank you, folks.
