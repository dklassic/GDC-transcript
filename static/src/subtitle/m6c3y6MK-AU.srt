00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:13,507
Hi everybody.

2
00:00:14,827 --> 00:00:18,408
First off, a quick video explaining what Among Us VR is all about.

3
00:00:20,269 --> 00:00:22,309
I applaud.

4
00:00:22,329 --> 00:00:23,510
This is me clapping my hands.

5
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,390
Oh come on!

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:29,511
Oh come on, we just started the game.

7
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:31,632
Come on pig, what is it, huh?

8
00:00:32,538 --> 00:00:33,339
What do you want?

9
00:00:33,419 --> 00:00:36,040
I like chicken nuggets!

10
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:36,821
Vote him out!

11
00:00:36,941 --> 00:00:38,182
Vote him out!

12
00:00:39,683 --> 00:00:42,024
Alright, welcome to Among Us VR Postmortem.

13
00:00:42,064 --> 00:00:49,889
So, along with the overview of Among Us VR development, we will highlight some wins and challenges that we faced.

14
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,892
So, don't worry about taking pictures or recording a talk.

15
00:00:53,932 --> 00:00:57,494
There will be a QR code at the end that you can use to download the entire deck.

16
00:00:58,755 --> 00:01:00,716
And yes, please do silence your cell phones.

17
00:01:02,323 --> 00:01:06,649
So, my name is Michal Książkiewicz, and I love multiplayer games!

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:09,774
And I'm also the design director on Among Us VR.

19
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:18,526
And I am Sean Patton, a principal game designer at Shell Games, and I worked on both minigames and playtesting efforts for Among Us VR.

20
00:01:20,277 --> 00:01:22,880
And I'm Jennifer, a senior production manager at Shell.

21
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:27,865
I've been there for five and a half years, but unlike Miho and Sean, my background was not in games.

22
00:01:28,826 --> 00:01:36,133
Previous to this, I had over 10 years of experience in project management in various industries, so I certainly brought a lot of transferable skills to the table.

23
00:01:36,433 --> 00:01:38,735
But truth be told, this has been my most exciting gig yet.

24
00:01:39,572 --> 00:01:44,554
Now before we zoom into any juicy stories, I want to zoom out to our high level schedule.

25
00:01:45,315 --> 00:01:48,356
It's a bit of a beast, but this will give you the overall project in numbers.

26
00:01:48,916 --> 00:01:52,378
And what this represents is 15 months from kickoff to launch.

27
00:01:52,938 --> 00:01:56,560
And to break this down further, we had eight weeks of pre-production,

28
00:01:58,176 --> 00:02:00,997
37 weeks of production, and 18 weeks of QA.

29
00:02:01,397 --> 00:02:10,100
That not only included our internal QA testing, but localization, Meta's FQA submission process, and four external stress tests, which you'll hear more on later.

30
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:21,824
By mid-September, we had what I'll call overlap, where for eight weeks, we were simultaneously wrapping up QA, prepping for launch, and kicking off a new team for post-launch and live ops work.

31
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,242
Thankfully, this was all with the same directors group.

32
00:02:25,842 --> 00:02:32,287
I cropped this image from our launch team contact list, which no matter which version you pull up, these five positions remain the same.

33
00:02:32,868 --> 00:02:39,853
And while there are times that it's better for the team to have a shift, we had the benefit of not weathering a change of project leadership, no matter the phase.

34
00:02:41,354 --> 00:02:44,176
And while I'm talking about staffing, we had 11 devs at kickoff.

35
00:02:45,197 --> 00:02:49,240
At our height, we had 28 beans, I mean, devs working concurrently.

36
00:02:50,393 --> 00:02:55,696
And over the course of the launch project, we had 49 developers and in-house QA folks to contribute to this effort.

37
00:02:56,497 --> 00:03:04,641
This number, however, does not include marketing, product, external vendors, in-studio playtesting support, and, well, you can see the credits.

38
00:03:05,382 --> 00:03:08,924
VR is no easy feat, even with a well-established IP.

39
00:03:09,784 --> 00:03:13,547
So now that I've given you some numbers to chew on, we can zoom in to where it all started.

40
00:03:14,267 --> 00:03:14,827
Pre-production.

41
00:03:15,328 --> 00:03:15,668
Excuse me.

42
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:23,203
How long it should be and what does being ready for production look like has varied greatly from project to project.

43
00:03:23,844 --> 00:03:28,227
I like to take the approach of establishing the criteria based on how many questions you have to answer.

44
00:03:28,747 --> 00:03:31,549
For Among Us VR, we had two major questions to get through.

45
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:33,871
How are we going to network this in VR?

46
00:03:34,452 --> 00:03:35,552
And what's even possible?

47
00:03:37,294 --> 00:03:39,796
The path for one of these was a little less rocky than the other.

48
00:03:40,236 --> 00:03:44,279
So to warm up, let's go over one of our first big wins, our beautiful corner.

49
00:03:46,405 --> 00:03:49,146
We knew we were going to go with rebuilding the Skeld in 3D.

50
00:03:49,507 --> 00:03:52,208
It was one of the first major decisions shortly after kickoff.

51
00:03:52,908 --> 00:04:03,194
To quickly give some context on that front, Among Us 2D has four maps you can choose to play on, with the Skeld being the first map InnerSloth released in June of 2018.

52
00:04:04,334 --> 00:04:08,397
And nearly five years later, it still remains the most popular and most played map.

53
00:04:09,217 --> 00:04:14,360
It would then serve as not only the map that people would be most excited to be immersed in, but also most familiar with.

54
00:04:15,204 --> 00:04:21,627
And while the engineers had to sort through networking solutions, art was set on choosing a room to bring to near polish.

55
00:04:22,247 --> 00:04:27,289
This would be our beautiful corner and would serve as our benchmark and basis for answering what's even possible.

56
00:04:28,910 --> 00:04:31,351
Now a lot can come together when creating a beautiful corner.

57
00:04:32,112 --> 00:04:34,833
Part of creating the room also included creating a character.

58
00:04:35,943 --> 00:04:39,306
This gave us a chance to work through size and scale for both Bean and Room.

59
00:04:39,986 --> 00:04:45,971
And once we started to narrow in on that, we replicated our character until we hit our set limits for performance.

60
00:04:47,392 --> 00:04:50,154
We discovered that 10 players is where we should max out at.

61
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:59,862
And while the decision for max players was rooted in performance, it made sense from the game design end as well, and just so happened to match the amount of players the 2D game launched with.

62
00:05:01,549 --> 00:05:07,710
Now, while I don't have a headset on hand for everyone to really do this justice, here's an image from the early beautiful quarter.

63
00:05:08,310 --> 00:05:09,671
We chose the Oxygen Room.

64
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:17,332
It had a good mix of mechanical and organic components, and it was small, so it could help us to guide the size of the beans better.

65
00:05:18,793 --> 00:05:22,994
It also had an opportunity for VFX, so we could start playing around with those elements as well.

66
00:05:23,974 --> 00:05:28,875
It just seemed fitting to breathe life into the VR version by starting with the Oxygen Room.

67
00:05:30,750 --> 00:05:35,411
When we wrapped up pre-production, we had the delivery of a room that you could get in headset and experience.

68
00:05:36,071 --> 00:05:40,752
Our beautiful corner would also help us to clear alignment with the look and feel with Innersloth and Robot Teddy.

69
00:05:41,473 --> 00:05:47,534
And with a medium they were so unfamiliar with, and an art style that we wanted to stay sacred to, this was imperative.

70
00:05:48,334 --> 00:05:55,476
It was our first chance of introducing the developers of Among Us to the top-down world they created, now rebuilt in first person.

71
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,923
Little did we know when we delivered this as a milestone, having this handy would actually go so much further.

72
00:06:02,783 --> 00:06:08,707
We got word that Jeff Keighley, video game journalist and host of the Game Awards, was a huge Among Us fan.

73
00:06:09,448 --> 00:06:17,713
So talks began if we could announce at the Game Awards, December of 2021, which would only be four months in and almost a year out from launch.

74
00:06:18,878 --> 00:06:25,265
The request came in hot and we didn't have a lot to work with, so we had to call in the best, trailer maker Derek Liu.

75
00:06:26,045 --> 00:06:33,013
And with our beautiful corner in hand, he made 27 seconds of magic to let the world know Among Us was coming to VR.

76
00:06:54,791 --> 00:06:55,632
Still gives me chills.

77
00:06:56,772 --> 00:06:59,334
But as I foreshadowed, it wasn't all smooth sailing.

78
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:03,557
While a big win for half the team was underway, the other half was grinding.

79
00:07:03,957 --> 00:07:07,260
We pulled on any resource within the studio that had networking experience.

80
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:09,901
It was all tech hands on deck.

81
00:07:10,741 --> 00:07:12,842
Unity had been decided as the engine of choice.

82
00:07:13,322 --> 00:07:20,105
And while we knew we weren't inventing something new, I mean multiplayer VR has already been a thing, the options were still limited.

83
00:07:20,846 --> 00:07:21,526
Really limited.

84
00:07:22,326 --> 00:07:25,248
The solution was a product by Exit Games, Photon.

85
00:07:25,768 --> 00:07:30,070
They pointed us to their newest product, wasn't even to market yet, Photon Fusion.

86
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:36,955
Part of the pre-production goal was to have a multiplayer demo, complete with role assignment and some basic forms of minigames.

87
00:07:37,515 --> 00:07:43,279
But documentation and support for Fusion was sparse, which is not ideal when you're trying to set up something new.

88
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:47,102
So after weeks of spinning wheels, we wanted to go backwards.

89
00:07:47,443 --> 00:07:51,306
They had previous powerful game networking middlewares, PhotonPun and Boltz.

90
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:56,369
We started researching in that direction, only to find out our timelines did not align.

91
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:00,521
They were deprecating and heading into maintenance mode, and we had no choice.

92
00:08:01,561 --> 00:08:06,004
In the name of stability and sustainability, we had to go with Photon Fusion.

93
00:08:07,806 --> 00:08:11,628
And the early challenges of this choice was unfortunately not limited to only pre-production.

94
00:08:12,189 --> 00:08:16,111
We were developing right alongside them, and with a product that hadn't even hit beta.

95
00:08:16,711 --> 00:08:21,094
We were just crossing our fingers and hoping for the best, but operating without their timeline.

96
00:08:21,955 --> 00:08:31,220
While all's well that ends well, we didn't account for the time sunk into debugging, and engineers were constantly battling and researching bugs, trying to even figure out whose bug it was.

97
00:08:31,661 --> 00:08:33,202
We did a lot of QAing along the way.

98
00:08:34,102 --> 00:08:37,064
But I digress, and I don't want to exit pre-production just yet.

99
00:08:37,445 --> 00:08:38,786
We have Pillars to talk about after all.

100
00:08:39,806 --> 00:08:40,187
Thank you.

101
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:47,953
So, having these important tech questions answered, we needed to focus our design approach, so we turned to Project Pillars.

102
00:08:49,314 --> 00:08:55,858
Now, in case you're unfamiliar with the concept, Project Pillars are kind of like guiding stars for your game.

103
00:08:56,439 --> 00:09:00,462
They are principles that you agree to stay true to throughout production.

104
00:09:02,487 --> 00:09:07,911
I'll go ahead and make the claim that we establish pretty good pillars that are serving us well until this day.

105
00:09:08,672 --> 00:09:09,332
So how do we do it?

106
00:09:09,893 --> 00:09:10,453
Three steps.

107
00:09:11,434 --> 00:09:16,278
First off, it could be really easy to make a long list of things that are important for your game.

108
00:09:16,938 --> 00:09:24,905
But you've got to remember that the more pillars you end up with, the more likely they are to end up conflicting with each other and getting blurred, which goes against their purpose.

109
00:09:25,755 --> 00:09:39,200
So to battle this, you should try to think about what is it really that makes your game special and try to focus the pillars on that, as well as combine your pillars into maybe a smaller number that is a little broader and covers the same basis.

110
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:46,925
Second, product pillars really only work if both your team and stakeholders believe and understand them.

111
00:09:47,525 --> 00:09:51,929
So make sure that you involve them in the process of creating pillars as early as you can.

112
00:09:52,629 --> 00:09:58,574
This is where you learn what is important to different people and different teams, and the sooner you learn that, the better.

113
00:10:01,016 --> 00:10:07,241
So now that you've established some small amount of good pillars that everyone's on board on and bought in, you need to use them.

114
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:15,681
So make sure you always evaluate your design choices against the pillars and scrutinize any feature that doesn't seem to quite align with them.

115
00:10:17,722 --> 00:10:20,824
As you do this, you may find yourself at odds with your pillars.

116
00:10:21,085 --> 00:10:22,546
This isn't necessarily a bad thing.

117
00:10:23,246 --> 00:10:30,552
This didn't happen a lot to us, but it may be that you needed to get your hands a little dirty before you realize what your pillars really want to be.

118
00:10:32,093 --> 00:10:34,094
So again, the sooner you do that, the better.

119
00:10:35,515 --> 00:10:37,357
So what kind of pillars do we have on Among Us VR?

120
00:10:38,702 --> 00:10:43,604
The first one we came up with was to bring the best of what Among Us is into VR.

121
00:10:44,544 --> 00:10:55,708
Among other things, what that meant is to preserve the visual style, the overall tone of the game, and to keep a low barrier of entry when it comes to learning how to play it and getting into matches with friends or strangers.

122
00:10:57,082 --> 00:11:01,985
Our second and last pillar was the one that I feel like we ended up shaking at each other more than the first.

123
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:04,867
And this was people play over gameplay.

124
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:12,352
What that meant is that our design decisions were to be in service of social deduction and players actually interacting with each other.

125
00:11:13,513 --> 00:11:15,634
It also aligned well with our accessibility goals.

126
00:11:16,915 --> 00:11:19,837
Okay, so making good pillars is really hard, right?

127
00:11:19,877 --> 00:11:25,321
Like it takes a lot of work, it takes time, you're arguing, but once you have them, it feels great to be equipped with those tools.

128
00:11:26,495 --> 00:11:31,702
So we're ready for the fun part of OMG, we're making Among Us in VR and it's going to be great.

129
00:11:31,722 --> 00:11:42,896
We're going to get two new crew members, at least one alternative imposter, two new game modes, some ghost only activities on our board, and like a shooting asteroids mini game that makes you feel like you're in the Millennium Falcon.

130
00:11:43,277 --> 00:11:43,837
Yeah, sorry.

131
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,931
I'm going to have to interject.

132
00:11:46,371 --> 00:11:47,993
Production work is clearly never done.

133
00:11:48,013 --> 00:11:50,295
I'm going to have to call our first emergency meeting here.

134
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:54,299
There's certainly a double-edged sword to blue sky brainstorms.

135
00:11:54,479 --> 00:12:01,825
And while I don't want to be the web blanket of production, you always want to have an airtight MVP before exiting pre-production.

136
00:12:02,486 --> 00:12:09,453
And I'm not saying to have all the questions perfectly answered, but you need to start solidifying that sandbox that you'll be playing in as best you can.

137
00:12:10,548 --> 00:12:12,229
So what do I mean by MVP?

138
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:18,673
So this is the minimum viable product, and it serves as the absolute smallest game that you're willing to launch with.

139
00:12:18,974 --> 00:12:20,595
And truly, it needs to be slim.

140
00:12:21,315 --> 00:12:24,858
You want to end pre-production with this document as defined as possible.

141
00:12:25,398 --> 00:12:27,699
This isn't the time for unapologetic optimism.

142
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:30,922
We've seen scope cuts generally go one of two ways.

143
00:12:31,662 --> 00:12:40,925
a death by a thousand paper cuts approach where at the 11th hour you've overscoped and you're trimming down piece by piece, usually cutting down team morale and everyone's soul right along with it.

144
00:12:41,826 --> 00:12:44,867
Or you come out the gate to cut until it hurts.

145
00:12:45,507 --> 00:12:51,209
And to stay in line with my graphic metaphors, the latter doesn't actually leave a team bleeding and wounded how you might think.

146
00:12:51,869 --> 00:12:54,351
There's acceptance when realistic expectations are set.

147
00:12:54,892 --> 00:13:02,519
The team can now digest and buy into what's doable versus having to recover from lofty expectations that might get crushed or lead to crunch.

148
00:13:03,740 --> 00:13:05,942
And how do we apply this to Among Us VR in particular?

149
00:13:06,643 --> 00:13:11,667
Well, we had all sorts of ideas to work with, but we did have a timeline to adhere to.

150
00:13:12,997 --> 00:13:15,380
and we wanted to prioritize getting this to market.

151
00:13:16,021 --> 00:13:25,171
So we stripped it back to what we thought would be the best gameplay in VR, staying true to our pillars and not veering too far from the magic that the 2D version had already discovered.

152
00:13:25,812 --> 00:13:27,834
We affectionately called it our vanilla version.

153
00:13:28,675 --> 00:13:30,195
Now, don't underestimate Vanilla.

154
00:13:30,555 --> 00:13:33,676
She's not boring, and she gave us a lot of power by way of flexibility.

155
00:13:34,456 --> 00:13:43,038
We knew our community would have a cross-section of players, die-hard Among Us fans without headsets, meet people with headsets that have never played the 2D game before.

156
00:13:43,818 --> 00:13:51,780
To allow this to have more of an organic growth and allow for the new community to have a hand in driving what Among Us VR should be, we needed Vanilla.

157
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:55,041
And I mean, it's America's favorite ice cream flavor after all.

158
00:13:55,341 --> 00:13:56,021
How could we go wrong?

159
00:13:58,777 --> 00:14:00,898
Oh, I want to talk about how we totally didn't go wrong.

160
00:14:02,438 --> 00:14:10,401
Admittedly, when we came to the realization that we're going to have to focus on fundamentals and stay within our scope, there was a moment of hesitation.

161
00:14:10,761 --> 00:14:12,542
We were, are we just porting?

162
00:14:12,582 --> 00:14:15,563
Is this some kind of color by numbers game making situation?

163
00:14:16,003 --> 00:14:17,264
Well, short answer, no.

164
00:14:17,984 --> 00:14:22,686
Longer answer, we still found plenty of design opportunities to make things interesting.

165
00:14:23,328 --> 00:14:30,594
There's totally room for creativity when you're translating a game from one platform to another, let alone when jumping all the way from 2D to VR.

166
00:14:32,416 --> 00:14:39,121
So consider which of your new platform's features are strengths that can help you capitalize on what is it that makes your game great.

167
00:14:40,042 --> 00:14:46,267
And maybe there are aspects that the original game shipped with that your translation process can improve upon or smooth out.

168
00:14:47,187 --> 00:14:53,429
So on Among Us VR, we came across quite a few opportunities like this, which was a win for us, and I want to highlight three of them in particular.

169
00:14:54,669 --> 00:15:03,351
So there's proximity voice chat that we added to the game, there's this magical crossover of optimization and simplification, and some balancing shortcuts that we took.

170
00:15:04,511 --> 00:15:06,692
So diving into proximity voice chat,

171
00:15:08,250 --> 00:15:17,155
While this already existed for the 2D game via mods to it, bringing it to first-person perspective VR with spatialized audio really was a game changer.

172
00:15:17,735 --> 00:15:20,977
And it did all the right things to a game about social deduction and arguing.

173
00:15:22,137 --> 00:15:27,080
So even though this was not gonna be easy to implement, we knew we can't leave that out of our MVP.

174
00:15:28,361 --> 00:15:36,405
We didn't immediately plan for any additional fancy features around voice chat, but some came up naturally and we ended up adopting them as just gimmies.

175
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:49,893
So hearing imposters in vents or forcing imposters to stay quiet while they're hiding inside of the vents was a bug at first, but we realized it's actually way more fun to do it and it doesn't really unbalance anything.

176
00:15:52,680 --> 00:15:58,783
Another thing was seances, which is where ghost players, so the dead ones, can still hear what the living are saying.

177
00:15:59,243 --> 00:16:01,544
And they can also open the doors by just approaching them.

178
00:16:02,004 --> 00:16:04,445
So it opens this supernatural line of communication.

179
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,006
You can be like, hey, ghost, did Red kill you?

180
00:16:07,587 --> 00:16:09,067
Open the door twice if you did it.

181
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:15,870
And it seems like such a game-breaking problem and such a huge advantage to the crewmates, but actually not so clear cut.

182
00:16:15,950 --> 00:16:17,191
There's plenty of room for error.

183
00:16:17,231 --> 00:16:19,012
There's dead imposters who are messing with this.

184
00:16:19,792 --> 00:16:23,975
So it actually ended up again being just this fun new thing that was now a feature in our game.

185
00:16:25,516 --> 00:16:33,141
Finally, we didn't quite predict how much noise and heated argumentation there's going to be once someone calls an emergency meeting.

186
00:16:33,642 --> 00:16:41,087
So the ghosts, who now can talk among themselves, but can't be heard by a living player, are trying to talk while everyone here is arguing, trying to blame each other.

187
00:16:41,889 --> 00:16:45,491
And so the ghost couldn't really hear themselves, which made the ghost experience worse.

188
00:16:46,191 --> 00:16:58,057
So what we ended up doing is applying this audio effect to the living player's voices as they come through the veil to the world of the dead, so that the ghost could tell who's speaking that is, you know, alive or dead.

189
00:16:58,237 --> 00:17:04,180
And this worked really well to solve this problem while being this cool reminder that you're dead, like you're in a different world.

190
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:17,554
Now, of course, voice chat also means that that much more opportunity for players to be less than excellent to each other, especially in a game that encourages you to lie, deceive, and literally get away with murder.

191
00:17:18,995 --> 00:17:21,216
Now, we knew that this would be a problem.

192
00:17:21,896 --> 00:17:29,479
It's not a new concept that people get toxic in multiplayer games, but we didn't manage to squeeze all the toxicity mitigating feature that we wanted to before launch.

193
00:17:29,999 --> 00:17:33,300
So those will have to come in future patches, one of them launching really soon.

194
00:17:35,572 --> 00:17:42,480
All right, moving on to this one simple trick for game design that probably needs a better name that I failed to come up with, but here's the gist of it.

195
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:46,825
So you're at the summit, you know how important it is to optimize your VR game.

196
00:17:47,325 --> 00:17:57,056
When you're developing for a phone strapped to someone's face, it's not just embarrassing to have your experience be dropping frames, it actually makes people sick and therefore they can't play your game.

197
00:17:58,693 --> 00:18:08,296
Now, at the same time, simplifying things is just a good game design principle because it's usually very easy to make things more complicated if you actually need to.

198
00:18:09,636 --> 00:18:12,417
So this struck us as this win-win combination, right?

199
00:18:12,437 --> 00:18:16,078
Like we can now leverage this in Among Us VR.

200
00:18:16,758 --> 00:18:19,079
And Sean will give you a quick example of how we did it in the wild.

201
00:18:21,593 --> 00:18:24,175
Yeah, so one example of this is in the task design, right?

202
00:18:24,575 --> 00:18:27,997
Tasks in Among Us are not actually meant to be a challenge.

203
00:18:28,538 --> 00:18:33,401
In fact, we aimed for players being able to figure them out without any tutorialization whatsoever.

204
00:18:34,402 --> 00:18:36,023
Draw calls were also at a premium.

205
00:18:36,603 --> 00:18:48,972
So simplifying some of the 2D games minigames made it not only perform better in VR, but also made them less prone to player VR error, where you accidentally interact with the stuff that you didn't mean to.

206
00:18:49,923 --> 00:19:06,742
In the example of Start Reactor, which is a Simon game, we ended up with a four-button layout that made the task less frustrating and less expensive performance-wise, while still remaining one of the most challenging and focus requiring tasks in the game.

207
00:19:08,283 --> 00:19:08,764
Thank you, Sean.

208
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,503
So this idea of simplification and optimization being a combo isn't only applicable to your game's performance.

209
00:19:18,123 --> 00:19:21,784
It also helps protect and optimize scope and schedule in general.

210
00:19:22,445 --> 00:19:33,289
So in alignment with our pillars, we decided to greatly simplify the matchmaking process by removing our lobby browser and letting Photon's matchmaking put players into games.

211
00:19:33,889 --> 00:19:36,050
This was also Photon's preferred way of doing this,

212
00:19:37,041 --> 00:19:38,562
and what they recommended to us.

213
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:39,942
More on this later.

214
00:19:40,903 --> 00:19:52,607
Now, this was a lot less work and a significant reduction of cases for QA to cover, but it was actually also better for the player experience, making it quicker and less confusing to find people to play with.

215
00:19:53,227 --> 00:20:02,391
The small caveat here is that we do get occasional requests for a lobby browser, just like in the 2D game, but it's pretty hard for us to justify that this would actually benefit our game.

216
00:20:04,187 --> 00:20:07,709
Finally, there's the crossover between accessibility and simplification.

217
00:20:08,510 --> 00:20:13,933
So in the same vein, when things are simpler, they are likely to also be more accessible.

218
00:20:14,794 --> 00:20:18,656
And we found a couple of little design rules along that supported this.

219
00:20:19,216 --> 00:20:27,942
So all minigames must be completable with a single hand, basically demands that they are less complex and easier to implement.

220
00:20:28,442 --> 00:20:29,203
So another win-win.

221
00:20:30,062 --> 00:20:33,084
Dexterity should not be a major factor for player success.

222
00:20:33,704 --> 00:20:41,167
It does the same thing, but notice the qualifier major that we snuck in there, that still leaves some space for player mastery.

223
00:20:42,668 --> 00:20:45,009
All right, moving on to the balancing shortcuts.

224
00:20:45,890 --> 00:20:49,191
So balancing is super important in multiplayer competitive games.

225
00:20:49,852 --> 00:20:56,455
So it's not like we could really leave it out of our MVP, but it can be really time consuming and requires a lot of large scale playtesting.

226
00:20:57,042 --> 00:20:58,223
So we had a problem.

227
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:06,690
What we decided to do is basically copy as much as we could from the original game to preserve as much of its original balance as possible.

228
00:21:07,370 --> 00:21:11,834
Now, discussions of what is the correct balance for an Among Us game, that didn't fit in the MVP.

229
00:21:13,756 --> 00:21:16,418
Now, the first thing we copied was the layout of the scout.

230
00:21:18,550 --> 00:21:22,972
It was basically copied one to one wherever possible with a notable difference pictured here.

231
00:21:23,592 --> 00:21:36,557
So on the left you see the picture of the reactor room where you have the two sabotage stations highlighted where two players need to go and touch them to kind of save the ship from blowing up and not lose the game.

232
00:21:37,508 --> 00:21:41,771
Now, how it works in the 2D game is your camera limits the view.

233
00:21:41,851 --> 00:21:46,554
So when you're at one of the stations, you can't see if there's anyone at the other one trying to fix it.

234
00:21:46,634 --> 00:21:54,799
And you kind of live in this uncertainty of not being sure if there's someone there helping, that someone just got murdered there over there, and so on.

235
00:21:54,959 --> 00:22:04,065
So in VR, what we had to do is build in alcoves to where those saboteur stations are, so that these limit your field of view and your line sites.

236
00:22:05,042 --> 00:22:06,283
to accomplish a similar effect.

237
00:22:07,124 --> 00:22:11,368
This was definitely an exception to the rule, though, of preserving Skel's original layout.

238
00:22:12,910 --> 00:22:22,520
All right, the next thing we copied was the run speed, so that we measured how long it takes in a 2D game to run from one end of the spaceship to the other, and we copied that into VR.

239
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:27,725
It actually ended up making the speed pretty quick, but we realized that it should work.

240
00:22:30,054 --> 00:22:35,597
We also copied the default match settings from the original, so things like number of imposters and cooldown durations.

241
00:22:36,517 --> 00:22:49,763
And then we didn't let players mess with them, which was both a scope win and aligned with our people-play-over-gameplay pillar, but it did mean that launching a balanced game was that much more important, because now we didn't give the players the tools to self-adjust.

242
00:22:51,708 --> 00:22:58,013
So because we copied all those other things though, it wasn't difficult to arrive at a balanced experience with just a few simple tweaks.

243
00:22:58,694 --> 00:23:02,597
So that's how we launched a balanced game without having to do any heavy lifting.

244
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:08,222
Now, all of these design wins were great, but how do we know that?

245
00:23:08,862 --> 00:23:16,869
Whether it comes to balancing or mini games or control schemes, ultimately, figuring out what works and what doesn't can't happen without a lot of playtesting.

246
00:23:18,671 --> 00:23:19,932
I love playtesting!

247
00:23:21,538 --> 00:23:27,743
After all, one of our shell games principles is play test constantly, it's the only way to know.

248
00:23:28,683 --> 00:23:36,669
Now, while I did a talk about play testing VR back in 2018, today I'll dig into two big differences between then and now.

249
00:23:37,509 --> 00:23:40,131
Those games I talked about, well, they were all single player.

250
00:23:40,692 --> 00:23:43,153
And of course, among us VR is multiplayer.

251
00:23:44,114 --> 00:23:48,417
The other big difference, well, we are still testing games during a pandemic.

252
00:23:49,538 --> 00:23:50,339
So let's dig into that.

253
00:23:51,625 --> 00:23:53,046
First, I'll talk about challenges.

254
00:23:53,467 --> 00:23:54,948
Pandemic and multiplayer are on there.

255
00:23:55,548 --> 00:24:01,354
But I will also cover challenges stemming from testing a game with a popular, established IP.

256
00:24:02,494 --> 00:24:06,658
I will also cover how we tested and decided on our locomotion controls.

257
00:24:07,479 --> 00:24:11,923
And finally, how we made sure we could handle thousands of players.

258
00:24:13,883 --> 00:24:15,704
Alright, so how do you test during a pandemic?

259
00:24:16,165 --> 00:24:26,772
Well, for us, Usertesting.com was an invaluable resource for finding folks that not only could test games remotely, but were able to cast and stream while they play.

260
00:24:27,612 --> 00:24:37,479
We made great use of their platform for I Expect You to Die 2 and our relaxing cooking game Lost Recipes, both of which were developed fully in the heart of the pandemic.

261
00:24:38,571 --> 00:24:47,566
Quick note, while we certainly focused our efforts on usertesting.com, they did not ask me to mention them and they're not the only game in town if you need the same resources.

262
00:24:48,817 --> 00:25:09,178
All right, so process-wise, first we'd send out screeners, questionnaires, to make sure people had VR gear and could cast, which basically meant Quest 2, because while it's possible to do other setups, Quest 2's market share and relative ease of use of setup and capture made it the one we focused on.

263
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:11,016
Interesting tip.

264
00:25:11,777 --> 00:25:22,841
When you were making these screeners, you need to keep in mind that folks on these testing sites, they're usually testing generic websites, which games are a treat for them, right?

265
00:25:22,922 --> 00:25:27,103
So we needed to keep people honest, or maybe at least paying attention.

266
00:25:27,824 --> 00:25:30,565
So we'd collect folks that could actually test our games.

267
00:25:31,265 --> 00:25:35,187
To that end, we had questionnaire that included questions like this one.

268
00:25:36,084 --> 00:25:38,805
meant to keep potential participants on their toes.

269
00:25:39,625 --> 00:25:44,007
Which of the following virtual reality headsets do you have access to right now?

270
00:25:44,667 --> 00:25:46,568
All right, let's look at the answers that we had in the system.

271
00:25:47,488 --> 00:25:49,229
You'll notice some interesting answers here.

272
00:25:49,709 --> 00:25:52,690
Like the Famicom 3D, that's not a thing.

273
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:56,872
The Google Crimson, which is a code name for the Daydream.

274
00:25:57,692 --> 00:26:01,094
The PlayStation Portal S, also not a thing.

275
00:26:01,967 --> 00:26:04,490
Then of course there's the Sensorama, which is from 1962.

276
00:26:07,313 --> 00:26:16,804
And then the Virtuality, the classic early 90s VR headset featured, among other places, in the 1995 cinematic masterpiece, Hackers.

277
00:26:17,585 --> 00:26:21,469
It's actually also the first headset that I developed VR on back in 2001.

278
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,473
And then lastly, we had this Xbox, the Xbox Moda.

279
00:26:27,193 --> 00:26:32,357
We made it up, but it still managed to cause a 132 comment thread on Reddit.

280
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:36,961
Did Among Us VR just leak an Xbox VR headset?

281
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:39,463
No, I'm sorry, we made that up.

282
00:26:41,205 --> 00:26:46,889
But under the hood, these answers have actions associated with them in the user testing platform.

283
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:52,454
Certain ones that actually exist, participants may select that was okay.

284
00:26:53,428 --> 00:26:56,149
Anyone who selects a fake one, they get rejected.

285
00:26:57,049 --> 00:27:00,590
And there in the middle is the only one that matters, the Quest 2.

286
00:27:01,211 --> 00:27:03,431
If participants select that, they're in.

287
00:27:06,152 --> 00:27:09,714
All right, so you think the only thing we have left to do is actually carry out the test, right?

288
00:27:10,914 --> 00:27:11,114
Nope.

289
00:27:12,094 --> 00:27:15,055
User testing platform does not handle multiple people at once.

290
00:27:15,916 --> 00:27:19,697
And as we all know, Among Us VR is multiplayer, so we needed a workaround.

291
00:27:21,188 --> 00:27:27,411
Our solution involved three tests per player, still conducted through User Testing's platform.

292
00:27:28,351 --> 00:27:35,134
A pre-test to record base information like familiarity with VR, playing habits, and game preferences.

293
00:27:35,994 --> 00:27:44,158
That test also asked participants to follow a process that made sure they really had the correct hardware and the capability to cast and record.

294
00:27:44,958 --> 00:27:47,059
A lot of folks who say they do, don't.

295
00:27:47,996 --> 00:27:53,578
Now that test ends with an agreement to meet at a certain date and time in a Google Meet.

296
00:27:54,478 --> 00:27:59,660
At this Google Meet, kind of like a VR speakeasy, participants take another test.

297
00:28:00,401 --> 00:28:09,524
This active test runs in parallel to the meet, it has installation instructions for the game, and also serves to record the cast of their gameplay.

298
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:12,151
through user testing's own platform.

299
00:28:12,791 --> 00:28:24,237
And finally, folks take a post-playtest questionnaire, which includes our base playtest questions and anything unique to the gameplay that they just tried, but more on those later.

300
00:28:26,619 --> 00:28:30,101
Now, while functional, this process was not without its issues.

301
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:37,665
There's the aforementioned liars who, despite our screeners, still slip through, and surprise, they don't have a quest to.

302
00:28:38,857 --> 00:28:44,101
Then there's more mundane issues, like devices not being charged or updated.

303
00:28:45,062 --> 00:28:52,088
Side note, Meta has an uncanny ability to push updates right before our tests, or at least it seemed that way to me.

304
00:28:53,129 --> 00:28:54,149
So how do we work on these?

305
00:28:54,730 --> 00:29:06,880
Well, we would send messages to players the day before, reminding them to charge their headsets, update their devices, and we would allow a full half hour of test time to troubleshoot with folks in that Google Meet.

306
00:29:08,355 --> 00:29:10,336
All right, next are audio issues.

307
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:15,558
Since Among Us VR has voice chat, once players are in the game, we want them talking there.

308
00:29:16,278 --> 00:29:28,023
And that audio, of course, would then conflict with the Google Meet, both volume-wise or worse, depending on the computer and their setup, the casting would sometimes not be allowed to record audio, and that would ruin the test.

309
00:29:28,503 --> 00:29:32,845
So again, more time allowed for troubleshooting, and an issue checklist helped with that.

310
00:29:33,937 --> 00:29:35,858
And then there were plenty of no-shows.

311
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:37,880
And how do you combat that?

312
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,741
Do you do it like the airlines and overbook?

313
00:29:40,421 --> 00:29:43,983
Well, what we did is we booked the full 10 players, our max that could play.

314
00:29:44,684 --> 00:29:51,168
And then we had some shell folks who were naive to the game, sort of in reserve, and arguably not as good as fully naive people.

315
00:29:51,328 --> 00:29:54,790
And it was also harder and harder to find those shell folks as the project went on.

316
00:29:55,971 --> 00:29:58,913
And if that didn't work out, then we would just play with less than 10 players.

317
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:05,795
Now this last one is not really an issue with the testers, more of a heads up for your development team.

318
00:30:07,076 --> 00:30:09,097
You're going to need a lot of debug options.

319
00:30:09,638 --> 00:30:11,599
You'll want something special for playtesting.

320
00:30:12,119 --> 00:30:18,043
We had things for Among Us like make the host not an imposter, restart the round, mute everyone.

321
00:30:18,990 --> 00:30:19,590
Things like that.

322
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:30,397
But we actually built into our build process that any builds that were going into the playtest channel were actually disabling that debug menu for anyone except the host.

323
00:30:30,977 --> 00:30:36,200
Because no matter how clever you are or think you are in hiding that menu, people will find it.

324
00:30:38,301 --> 00:30:40,863
All right, let's talk about the challenge of an established IP.

325
00:30:42,404 --> 00:30:47,467
We had to always be aware of the level of familiarity our playtesters had with the game.

326
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:52,092
2D Among Us is being played by AOC, by Jimmy Fallon, for God's sakes.

327
00:30:52,752 --> 00:30:54,192
It's in the cultural zeitgeist.

328
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:58,474
So in that screener that I mentioned earlier, we would ask if they've ever heard of Among Us.

329
00:30:58,734 --> 00:30:59,355
Have they played it?

330
00:30:59,535 --> 00:30:59,955
How much?

331
00:31:00,695 --> 00:31:04,517
But again, as Gregory House has taught us, everybody lies.

332
00:31:05,397 --> 00:31:08,679
So we'd ask follow-up questions when anything seemed suspicious.

333
00:31:09,599 --> 00:31:14,181
But at the end of the day, we would be looking for three groups to intentionally playtest with.

334
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:22,622
all naive to the game, heard about it but never played it was okay, all familiar, and a mix.

335
00:31:23,182 --> 00:31:28,243
Now, hold on, I have a suspicious choice here that I want to talk about.

336
00:31:29,024 --> 00:31:42,027
So deciding how to react to playtest data from all these different player groups, and knowing that there's even more player groups, we had to make some difficult, not to say impossible choices, and you know, we had to pick our favorite kids.

337
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:48,823
So at first place, most favorite, were players who are both new to VR and Among Us.

338
00:31:49,384 --> 00:31:54,767
Those are players that we knew are going to need most help, and we didn't want to sour anyone to our game.

339
00:31:54,827 --> 00:31:56,187
Remember the low barrier of entry.

340
00:31:57,048 --> 00:32:04,492
This choice led us to spending a good chunk of our development time developing, making an interactive tutorial that didn't exist in the original game.

341
00:32:05,693 --> 00:32:11,156
At favorite kid runner-up, we have players new to VR only, but maybe familiar with Among Us.

342
00:32:11,904 --> 00:32:16,487
So at Shell Games, we always cared a lot about making VR newbies feel comfortable and welcome.

343
00:32:17,428 --> 00:32:23,692
So we ended up committing a lot of our time to providing a plethora of controls and comfort features to that end.

344
00:32:25,113 --> 00:32:29,497
In third place, we have players new to Among Us only, but familiar and comfortable with VR.

345
00:32:30,177 --> 00:32:35,401
Although social deduction games can be actually a pretty strange concept to someone who's never played them.

346
00:32:36,722 --> 00:32:46,811
and we observed that we had to tweak some of our settings, for example, making your smooth turn speed much faster than what any of us was comfortable with, because players out there are happy spinning really fast.

347
00:32:48,012 --> 00:32:58,822
We also were close to defaulting our turn modes to be head-based, so this is basically where you move your head, that's what determines your forward direction, which again, was something that experienced players play with.

348
00:32:59,762 --> 00:33:07,486
But thanks again to this ranking, ultimately we ended up going with what we felt will be the better for players new to VR, so kind of the twin stick movement.

349
00:33:08,747 --> 00:33:11,409
Coming at least favorite was everyone else.

350
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:18,733
So basically players who are both among us and VR veterans, who we just weren't super worried about having to do anything special for.

351
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:25,997
Now, unfortunately, that did mean that we probably disappointed that player group the most, and that's not great.

352
00:33:26,077 --> 00:33:27,258
Those were some of our big fans.

353
00:33:34,745 --> 00:33:38,648
Let's talk a little about locomotion.

354
00:33:39,229 --> 00:33:45,575
When we first started to think about reimagining Among Us for VR, there were two main locomotion camps on the team.

355
00:33:46,836 --> 00:33:47,877
Direct thumbstick move.

356
00:33:48,437 --> 00:33:51,020
You push the thumbstick in the first person, and you move.

357
00:33:52,445 --> 00:33:57,871
and third person, which is an interesting method of movement that really you'd have to see to believe.

358
00:33:58,051 --> 00:33:58,832
Yeah, I got this one.

359
00:33:59,012 --> 00:33:59,532
I can show it.

360
00:33:59,652 --> 00:34:02,675
This happened actually in the pre-Sean, pre-production times.

361
00:34:03,997 --> 00:34:12,044
And I can't bring up locomotion or you can't bring up locomotion without sharing more details about how third person movement was known as penguin mode.

362
00:34:13,238 --> 00:34:19,723
We had an idea to eliminate any discomfort from moving, while also keeping the character pace the same, something teleport doesn't do.

363
00:34:20,423 --> 00:34:24,626
When you push the thumbstick, you see your body move, and you are sort of remote controlling it.

364
00:34:25,307 --> 00:34:27,188
It seemed to work, but we needed to playtest.

365
00:34:27,609 --> 00:34:35,555
And in the name of playtesting constantly and answering questions early, you can see from the clip how primitive our early playtests were, yet it didn't hinder us.

366
00:34:36,509 --> 00:34:44,777
It's also important to note playtesting with established IP takes additional steps and strategy, not just vetting playtesters prior to the test.

367
00:34:45,238 --> 00:34:49,102
Beloved IPs and characters have influence that you might not want skewing results.

368
00:34:49,622 --> 00:34:55,969
So think through similar sizes and shapes to your well-known characters and pick one to implement and anonymize the playtest with.

369
00:34:56,449 --> 00:34:59,052
That way you have the same feel and your findings can be accurate.

370
00:35:00,452 --> 00:35:03,453
With the early timing of our playtesting, we needed to consider marketing.

371
00:35:03,913 --> 00:35:08,795
If any leaks occurred prior to our announcement trailer, it'd be a whole other host of issues to deal with.

372
00:35:09,235 --> 00:35:12,116
So we used a penguin, our honorary first space bean.

373
00:35:12,536 --> 00:35:13,297
Rest in peace, penguin.

374
00:35:15,237 --> 00:35:15,737
That's awesome.

375
00:35:15,897 --> 00:35:17,358
Yeah, maybe you need a penguin hat in the future.

376
00:35:18,922 --> 00:35:20,704
So what did all this playtesting show?

377
00:35:21,224 --> 00:35:28,450
Well, in short, it showed that the third-person or out-of-body playtesting worked really well for curbing any feelings of discomfort.

378
00:35:29,031 --> 00:35:30,932
But, and this is a big but,

379
00:35:31,772 --> 00:35:37,194
The fantasy of Among Us VR, the pillar even, is the best of Among Us in VR.

380
00:35:37,714 --> 00:35:39,535
And what does VR do extremely well?

381
00:35:39,975 --> 00:35:40,455
Immersion.

382
00:35:40,675 --> 00:35:41,275
Simulation.

383
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:43,976
Fulfilling the fantasy of being a crewmate.

384
00:35:44,656 --> 00:35:47,517
If I'm constantly leaving my body, who even am I?

385
00:35:48,357 --> 00:35:56,120
So even if we thought we had time to do both control schemes, which we didn't, we shouldn't because it breaks that fantasy.

386
00:35:57,118 --> 00:36:04,703
So with a first-person movement decision made, well, that also means we needed to add a bunch of nausea-reducing options, which we did.

387
00:36:06,405 --> 00:36:06,585
What?

388
00:36:06,725 --> 00:36:07,685
Everyone else was doing it to me.

389
00:36:08,306 --> 00:36:10,367
I'm just resetting the kill cooldowns here, folks.

390
00:36:11,148 --> 00:36:26,339
So we made the settings, but we found in our testing that even when we explicitly required players to open the settings menu in the tutorial, folks were still not understanding, well, which settings were for them, or even that the settings existed at all.

391
00:36:27,367 --> 00:36:33,350
So, we bought a costume, we channeled our inner TikTok, and we made a series of videos.

392
00:36:33,771 --> 00:36:34,751
This was the first one.

393
00:36:35,211 --> 00:36:38,113
In this video, we'll cover moving in Among Us VR.

394
00:36:38,433 --> 00:36:41,915
Moving is achieved through the use of one or more controllers.

395
00:36:42,175 --> 00:36:43,916
Many settings can be customized.

396
00:36:44,257 --> 00:36:46,258
Move with your left hand is the default.

397
00:36:46,538 --> 00:36:48,039
Try pushing forward now.

398
00:36:49,019 --> 00:36:54,382
Right hand is available, as well as single-handed mirrored mode, where both hands do the same thing.

399
00:36:57,351 --> 00:36:58,994
And this is my favorite.

400
00:36:59,374 --> 00:37:01,918
Let's learn about moving the map in Among Us VR.

401
00:37:02,339 --> 00:37:03,240
Need the map closer?

402
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:04,262
Pull it closer.

403
00:37:04,782 --> 00:37:09,650
If the map is in your way when running, simply grab that white bar and move it up or down.

404
00:37:10,030 --> 00:37:11,633
There, an unobstructed view.

405
00:37:12,093 --> 00:37:12,975
Now you can relax.

406
00:37:19,089 --> 00:37:19,269
about.

407
00:37:33,775 --> 00:37:35,678
First, let's talk generally about these tests.

408
00:37:35,978 --> 00:37:39,303
We needed to be sure that our game could handle lots of players at once.

409
00:37:40,045 --> 00:37:49,179
While the observed testing that we'd been doing up to that point was all about tweaking gameplay, these tests were all about free play, letting people play unsupervised.

410
00:37:50,004 --> 00:37:53,187
Also, it would be the first time we really pushed Photon Fusion.

411
00:37:53,747 --> 00:37:55,348
Stress testing at its finest.

412
00:37:56,109 --> 00:37:57,750
Testing matchmaking at scale.

413
00:37:58,531 --> 00:38:00,292
And it all pretty much worked.

414
00:38:00,593 --> 00:38:01,273
So that was great.

415
00:38:02,214 --> 00:38:04,175
But we also had marketing considerations.

416
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:11,321
We had kept a pretty firm lid on testing up until this point with NDAs, some strongly worded emails if need be.

417
00:38:12,062 --> 00:38:16,025
But now we'd had a lot more people to test with and a lot more people to handle.

418
00:38:16,525 --> 00:38:19,148
So we figured there would be some leaks and we needed to be ready for that.

419
00:38:20,055 --> 00:38:24,917
Honestly, we probably should have started stress testing a little earlier, but we were afraid of those leaks.

420
00:38:25,417 --> 00:38:28,419
We did our first test with hundreds of players on August 11th, 2022.

421
00:38:29,899 --> 00:38:33,321
And remember, we were launching on November 10th, so this was late in the game.

422
00:38:34,361 --> 00:38:41,225
Also, these tests weren't really going to be a design test, but they still kind of were.

423
00:38:41,825 --> 00:38:46,507
Insights gleaned from these tests helped inform our first patches and updates.

424
00:38:47,660 --> 00:38:52,146
Lastly, we needed to keep in mind this feedback was from a very specific audience.

425
00:38:52,726 --> 00:38:58,033
These were the very eager, the Among Us fans who owned VR already and were very active in our Discord.

426
00:38:58,894 --> 00:39:00,616
Alright, so how did all this testing go?

427
00:39:01,598 --> 00:39:04,521
Well, it turns out that stress testing was quite stressful.

428
00:39:06,352 --> 00:39:07,333
Let's talk about those issues.

429
00:39:07,993 --> 00:39:14,677
We had partnered with an entity that was going to help get all the testers under NDA in the Discord ready to go.

430
00:39:15,398 --> 00:39:16,859
But it didn't quite work out that way.

431
00:39:17,219 --> 00:39:23,783
There were communications issues throughout and we sort of ended up having to do a lot of the work that we'd pay them to do ourselves.

432
00:39:24,930 --> 00:39:29,753
we actually also had trouble getting people into the, you know, the bills onto player devices.

433
00:39:30,354 --> 00:39:36,398
For the smaller 10 person tests, it was relatively trivial to add the correct email addresses through Meta's system.

434
00:39:36,798 --> 00:39:40,081
So players were on the right channel and could find and download the bill.

435
00:39:40,961 --> 00:39:44,984
Now here we were trying to paste hundreds or thousands of emails in at a time.

436
00:39:45,384 --> 00:39:48,486
And if just one wasn't valid, that whole batch would be flagged and wouldn't work.

437
00:39:48,907 --> 00:39:51,188
So we had to do chunks of the emails at a time.

438
00:39:51,809 --> 00:39:53,210
By hand, it was not great.

439
00:39:54,205 --> 00:39:59,730
Quick tip, the site to add emails to a channel claims the limit is 1,000, but that's actually not true.

440
00:40:00,830 --> 00:40:03,112
But thankfully, we had a great relationship with Meta.

441
00:40:03,473 --> 00:40:07,956
We worked with their folks to make the process better, and it should now be better for all of you too.

442
00:40:09,197 --> 00:40:10,398
Here's an interesting anecdote.

443
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:17,844
We ended up testing the logic that decided how many imposters there would be during one of our stress tests.

444
00:40:18,465 --> 00:40:20,887
Normally, for four to seven players, there is one imposter.

445
00:40:21,512 --> 00:40:21,672
for you.

446
00:40:45,173 --> 00:40:47,215
So we got important information from that.

447
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:55,684
But yeah, it was hard getting thousands of players into a secret game built on a new network infrastructure with new tools.

448
00:40:56,505 --> 00:40:59,508
I guess that's why they call it being on the bleeding edge of technology.

449
00:41:03,348 --> 00:41:04,628
It was also totally worth it.

450
00:41:04,969 --> 00:41:06,610
We were very glad we did these tests.

451
00:41:07,150 --> 00:41:11,432
We weathered the storm and knew our infrastructure could stand up to the onslaught.

452
00:41:12,213 --> 00:41:16,595
Some imbalances with the imposter win rate also became visible with all the new data.

453
00:41:17,155 --> 00:41:23,338
So we were able to tweak some cooldowns and which minigames were visual, that is, which minigames other players could see the results of.

454
00:41:23,979 --> 00:41:25,920
And we ended up balancing the game even better.

455
00:41:27,225 --> 00:41:40,529
And we had the joy of seeing thousands of players enjoying what we'd worked so hard to create, giving validation to our team that we had succeeded in reimagining a beloved game for a whole new medium.

456
00:41:41,190 --> 00:41:45,471
So while a challenge, VR playtesting was also a win as well.

457
00:41:46,712 --> 00:41:48,692
Now, testing with the smaller groups was great.

458
00:41:49,612 --> 00:41:53,954
And while testing, you know, the stress tests were also a win.

459
00:41:55,843 --> 00:42:05,287
All right, now, as I covered in my 2008 talk on playtesting, there are four main questions that you want to... Listen, they can just watch your talk on the GDC fault, and we're almost out of time.

460
00:42:05,827 --> 00:42:09,308
Meanwhile, I do want to mention another bump we hit right after launch.

461
00:42:10,469 --> 00:42:18,592
So basically, as soon as we stopped celebrating our launch, we noticed something that didn't come up in the stress test or playtests, and that caught us by surprise.

462
00:42:19,320 --> 00:42:28,006
Basically, every game you joined already had about eight people in it, and it immediately filled up, which seems good, but actually wasn't for a couple of reasons.

463
00:42:28,787 --> 00:42:36,333
So the bigger problem with it was that, you know, you have that one other friend who also has VR, and obviously you want to play Among Us together, but you can't.

464
00:42:36,813 --> 00:42:41,657
You would join the game at this lobby that just opened and immediately filled up back to 10.

465
00:42:41,957 --> 00:42:46,060
So by the time you could relay the lobby code to them, the lobby was already full.

466
00:42:47,592 --> 00:42:55,455
Also, this would be joining the lobby at kind of the most chaotic and loud part of the life cycle of an Among Us game.

467
00:42:55,895 --> 00:43:10,100
So as soon as a match ends and everyone's super excited and freaking out about what just happened and who backstabbed who and how crazy lies were told, that's when new players will be immediately put into that lobby and exposed to all this excitement and loudness.

468
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:11,860
So what was the problem?

469
00:43:12,781 --> 00:43:13,701
And it was our matchmaking.

470
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:25,806
Now, because we didn't fully predict how our matchmaking will look in the wild, and we couldn't really observe it even in our large-scale playtest, it had a negative impact on our player review scores right at the launch rush.

471
00:43:27,347 --> 00:43:27,907
So what happened?

472
00:43:28,628 --> 00:43:41,175
So, in a nutshell, it turns out that the oldest first matchmaking scheme, which was what Photon recommended and was default with, was just not the right type of matchmaking for the type of game that Among Us is.

473
00:43:42,159 --> 00:43:44,621
So I'll show you some analytics data as I explain why.

474
00:43:45,361 --> 00:43:51,325
So what you see here is relatively how many games start with a different number of players.

475
00:43:51,465 --> 00:43:52,926
Minimum is 4, maximum is 10.

476
00:43:53,466 --> 00:43:56,648
So at launch you see that most of them are starting with 10 or 9 players.

477
00:43:57,189 --> 00:43:58,049
So far so good.

478
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:03,133
But because our lobbies can get old and therefore be, you know,

479
00:44:04,440 --> 00:44:12,603
lasting for a long time, as soon as that game ended, it would get pushed into the beginning of the matchmaking queue to scoop up all the players.

480
00:44:13,303 --> 00:44:28,249
Now, another quirk of Among Us is that while the game will start with 10 players, it often ends with about six or seven, because players will immediately quit when they're not picked as the imposter or when they get killed or frustrated or tilted in any other way.

481
00:44:29,290 --> 00:44:30,090
So a game would end,

482
00:44:30,438 --> 00:44:39,822
in this lobby that's been going on for a really long time because we have host migration, right, and it just exists, and immediately get pushed to the front of the queue where it's scooped up all the players trying to matchmake.

483
00:44:40,562 --> 00:44:54,729
So if this, excuse me, if this circle represents the amount of old lobbies that were almost full jumping to front of the matchmaking line, this is, you know, the amount of new lobbies being created by players trying to let their friends in.

484
00:44:55,575 --> 00:45:04,499
Now, if you did that, you would end up waiting there for maybe like 10 minutes without nothing happening, and then suddenly your lobby would become old enough to get all these players in.

485
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:08,761
Most players would immediately give up and think something's broken, which they weren't wrong.

486
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:18,166
So we kind of scrambled and we decided this has to be fixed as fast as we can, which, you know, isn't that fast when you're deploying a multiplayer VR game.

487
00:45:19,025 --> 00:45:23,811
So we talked to Photon, and our options for immediate action were actually fairly limited.

488
00:45:24,592 --> 00:45:35,968
But we decided to go with trying a sequential matchmaking scheme instead, where lobbies will just queue up at the end of the line, no matter how old they are, and players will be evenly in sequence distributed to them.

489
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:56,393
So we didn't really know what to expect, but what we saw was almost the complete inverse of the previous situation, where most matches were now starting with four players, and as the player number increased, the number of matches started with them would decrease, with a notable bump at eight, where you do get the second imposter entering the game.

490
00:45:57,345 --> 00:46:01,307
So our first thought was, wait a minute, are four-player Among Us games even fun?

491
00:46:01,367 --> 00:46:02,347
Like, what's happening in there?

492
00:46:02,968 --> 00:46:19,135
So we went in and we started playing to check it out, and it turns out, really, like, just because they may not have the same strategic depth as matches with more players, it's still fun to chase each other around and have the whole thing be over quickly, whether you were the first one to die or not.

493
00:46:19,595 --> 00:46:22,577
So it's kind of like jumping to Among Us Endgame straight away.

494
00:46:23,720 --> 00:46:27,161
So is sequential matchmaking the ideal solution?

495
00:46:27,341 --> 00:46:27,961
Well, not quite.

496
00:46:28,362 --> 00:46:31,002
But just with a few more charts and bars, I'll explain.

497
00:46:32,203 --> 00:46:34,043
But really, we're running out of time.

498
00:46:35,004 --> 00:46:40,165
And I want to make sure that we land this spaceship and make sure that you call all of our wins and challenges.

499
00:46:40,746 --> 00:46:47,508
So for wins, we talked through going with the beautiful corner approach in pre-production, which had a lot of benefits nested underneath that.

500
00:46:48,188 --> 00:46:56,555
Next was setting up pillars which helped to guide our project as a whole and served as a foundation for the MVP and ensuring you're not overscoped right out the gate.

501
00:46:57,336 --> 00:47:02,480
Mihael then shared the translation into VR and Sean went into details on our multiplayer VR playtesting.

502
00:47:03,241 --> 00:47:15,612
Our challenges were networking, specifically working with products that are also in development, moderation features, target audience sacrifices, matchmaking, and again, VR playtesting, which really took up the entire spectrum.

503
00:47:17,116 --> 00:47:18,217
So what does the future hold?

504
00:47:18,577 --> 00:47:24,301
Well, from our admittedly privileged perspective, the time to make multiplayer games in VR is definitely upon us.

505
00:47:24,901 --> 00:47:26,962
Multiplayer games thrive in VR.

506
00:47:27,323 --> 00:47:32,086
And the more your experience relies on interactions between players, the better it will feel in VR.

507
00:47:32,706 --> 00:47:36,909
There is still so much open space to explore and 2D games to bring into VR.

508
00:47:37,289 --> 00:47:38,089
So good luck out there.

509
00:47:40,911 --> 00:47:41,872
I think this means we did it.

510
00:47:47,890 --> 00:47:49,211
Yep.

511
00:47:49,271 --> 00:47:49,691
Thank you.

512
00:47:49,751 --> 00:47:51,552
Thank you so much for coming and for listening.

513
00:47:51,832 --> 00:47:52,853
Grab the slides if you like.

514
00:47:53,353 --> 00:47:54,814
They are actually up there on the website.

515
00:47:55,174 --> 00:47:57,836
And while our talk time is up, we do have time for questions.

516
00:47:58,396 --> 00:48:01,118
And we'll also be in the wrap-up room in 2.04 afterwards.

517
00:48:01,318 --> 00:48:02,258
But yeah, any questions?

518
00:48:02,418 --> 00:48:03,739
And oh, fill out the surveys too.

519
00:48:03,899 --> 00:48:04,520
Thank you very much.

520
00:48:06,581 --> 00:48:06,781
Yeah.

521
00:48:06,901 --> 00:48:07,161
Thanks.

522
00:48:07,321 --> 00:48:08,662
Really entertaining and informative.

523
00:48:08,942 --> 00:48:12,825
I was wondering, what XR interaction framework did you guys use?

524
00:48:14,005 --> 00:48:16,687
So the question was, what XR interaction framework did we use?

525
00:48:17,714 --> 00:48:27,101
The XR interaction framework... We basically just used what we had from our previous VR games and it was in-house custom built stuff.

526
00:48:28,482 --> 00:48:28,982
Within Unity.

527
00:48:29,683 --> 00:48:30,503
One other quick question.

528
00:48:30,763 --> 00:48:32,164
Is there a reason you didn't go with Mirror?

529
00:48:32,264 --> 00:48:33,285
You went with Photon.

530
00:48:33,665 --> 00:48:35,867
Did you consider Mirror as a networking framework at all?

531
00:48:37,522 --> 00:48:39,183
I'm sorry, could you say the name of it again?

532
00:48:39,264 --> 00:48:39,604
MIR?

533
00:48:39,944 --> 00:48:42,526
It's another Unity framework.

534
00:48:43,087 --> 00:48:44,708
No, we did not go down that path.

535
00:48:44,808 --> 00:48:49,052
Our engineers looked at a couple different networking frameworks and they chose Photon.

536
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:53,075
There were some issues, but it ended up working out.

537
00:48:53,196 --> 00:48:54,537
It is what it is.

538
00:48:54,557 --> 00:48:54,897
Great, thank you.

539
00:49:00,101 --> 00:49:00,902
Hi, thank you for the talk.

540
00:49:01,803 --> 00:49:12,334
So as designers, when you want to validate your design, you get your built-in engineers, and now in a non-VR application, you can have two computers, like, use one mouse to stab yourself in the back and see what that interaction's like.

541
00:49:12,775 --> 00:49:16,338
In VR, you've got one headset, so do you just put one on, put one off?

542
00:49:16,699 --> 00:49:19,342
What kind of challenges do you have there and what workarounds did you find?

543
00:49:19,980 --> 00:49:22,863
Yeah, so question about handling multiplayer in VR.

544
00:49:23,463 --> 00:49:26,186
That's definitely something we've dealt with on this project and others.

545
00:49:26,806 --> 00:49:30,349
A lot of our developers will have two VR headsets.

546
00:49:31,170 --> 00:49:38,617
We actually have gone so far as to buy mannequin heads that we can attach to our desks and will keep the headset alive and also point it in a reasonable direction.

547
00:49:39,237 --> 00:49:41,599
but our engineers also made tools within Unity.

548
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:51,668
We call it the Photon Fusion Simulator and it'll open multiple windows and so you can then swap in the different bodies of different beings to test some of those multiplayer things.

549
00:49:51,708 --> 00:49:55,912
So great tool development and support and also $25 mannequins off of Amazon.

550
00:49:56,552 --> 00:49:57,053
Thank you very much.

551
00:49:59,312 --> 00:50:02,797
Hi, how did you handle motion sickness during playtests?

552
00:50:02,817 --> 00:50:05,482
Like if a playtester got motion sick, what was the approach?

553
00:50:06,042 --> 00:50:12,132
Did you just end the playtest right there or did you find some sort of alternative to let them keep playtesting basically?

554
00:50:12,663 --> 00:50:16,044
Yeah, no great question about how do we handle motion sickness in playtesting.

555
00:50:17,104 --> 00:50:26,005
A lot of it is in that Google Meet, before folks would start, we'd say, hey, if you feel bad or discomfort at any time, feel free to jump out, let us know.

556
00:50:26,585 --> 00:50:29,446
So we sort of set that expectation early that people could jump out.

557
00:50:29,926 --> 00:50:34,467
We also had all the settings that we talked about, vignetting, things like that.

558
00:50:34,927 --> 00:50:39,928
And so we also made them aware of that in the playtest where we weren't testing to see if they knew about that.

559
00:50:40,868 --> 00:50:45,371
And yeah, it's all about setting expectations at the beginning of a playtest.

560
00:50:46,031 --> 00:50:55,156
And I will mention the 2018 talk, Playtesting VR, because we go into that and how to like, because it's a very isolating experience to go into VR, right?

561
00:50:55,196 --> 00:51:00,419
And so you want your playtesters, even if they're on their own home with user testing during a pandemic, you want them to feel at ease.

562
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:07,823
And so setting expectations early and sort of having a script that we run through to make sure people know that they can get out, that it's okay.

563
00:51:07,944 --> 00:51:09,184
Don't force yourself to keep going.

564
00:51:09,544 --> 00:51:10,325
That's all part of that.

565
00:51:11,213 --> 00:51:12,975
And it's different than motion sickness too.

566
00:51:13,095 --> 00:51:25,867
So I think just helping to educate, especially early on, so they understand when those symptoms are starting to even occur can just help to, again, just ground people better and just make sure that they're aware of like, Oh, maybe I should get out now before I do get myself just really sick.

567
00:51:25,887 --> 00:51:29,050
Cause again, it can start sometimes it's just, you know, a headache or things like that.

568
00:51:29,110 --> 00:51:32,092
So just helping people to understand how different this is.

569
00:51:32,853 --> 00:51:33,033
Yep.

570
00:51:33,694 --> 00:51:33,854
Yeah.

571
00:51:33,874 --> 00:51:34,335
Great question.

572
00:51:34,475 --> 00:51:34,715
Thank you.

573
00:51:35,692 --> 00:51:37,133
So first, congratulations on your game.

574
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:39,735
I'm really excited to have another multiplayer game out there.

575
00:51:40,616 --> 00:51:48,842
As a multiplayer game developer myself, I see when I go to the store that Oculus has submission guidelines saying that we need to have moderation tools and the like in order for our game to get approved.

576
00:51:49,382 --> 00:51:57,608
I was wondering if you could maybe demystify that a little bit and tell us kind of what they're looking for and what kind of features we should build in ahead of time.

577
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:58,609
Yeah.

578
00:52:02,592 --> 00:52:25,569
they have so any multiplayer game they do have just a standard api package uh that they have to give us and we implement on behalf of them uh i'd say we are working to build on top of that as well uh i guess i don't know how much we can get into details about all of that but as soon as you enter that space they certainly will tag you and make sure that these are the

579
00:52:26,798 --> 00:52:26,958
that

580
00:52:49,423 --> 00:53:15,237
make the environment a little friendlier but you know meta is definitely in process of developing this stuff and like what exists is really just a way to report other meta players through their system maybe a quick follow-up question in terms of post-launch support how much resources should one you know kind of forecast on allocating for supporting moderation and the like yeah i i was not necessarily involved in those discussions

581
00:53:16,345 --> 00:53:22,108
The question was, how much resources should you allocate for post-launch player support or customer support?

582
00:53:23,328 --> 00:53:26,730
Basically, it depends on the volume of players that you have and the amount of issues.

583
00:53:27,450 --> 00:53:34,654
We certainly had a bigger influx of tickets early on, and we worked with a company called Keywords for support.

584
00:53:35,394 --> 00:53:37,096
and they're good at scaling, right?

585
00:53:37,136 --> 00:53:38,217
So we don't know.

586
00:53:38,297 --> 00:53:50,969
The answer is we've kind of trailblazed a lot of this, so we didn't have a lot of benchmarks for saying what does a giant multiplayer game in VR with 10 people in a lobby, you know, cause in terms of support tickets and player submitted requests.

587
00:53:51,689 --> 00:53:56,233
So, you know, it was basically about let's be flexible, let's be prepared to scale up if we need to.

588
00:53:56,882 --> 00:54:04,567
We also had post-launch, we had a bunch of issues that we didn't catch, which were repeatedly showing up in our support.

589
00:54:04,968 --> 00:54:10,471
And then after we released our first and second patch that addressed a lot of those, that definitely all quieted down a lot.

590
00:54:11,352 --> 00:54:11,892
Thank you very much.

591
00:54:11,912 --> 00:54:12,773
Thanks.

592
00:54:13,737 --> 00:54:14,817
Yeah, I have a different question.

593
00:54:15,158 --> 00:54:21,700
I actually teach game design at the high school level, I teach with Unity, and we're actually getting into making VR games with Unity.

594
00:54:22,140 --> 00:54:27,782
So my thing is, I'm just different from you guys, sorry, but like, what should I be bringing to the kids?

595
00:54:27,922 --> 00:54:30,283
And what, what should they be prepping for?

596
00:54:30,363 --> 00:54:37,606
Because so many of them want a career like you guys have, like, I know, it's a broad question, but like, maybe one or two things, like, what should we be bringing to kids?

597
00:54:37,626 --> 00:54:38,846
What should I be bringing to the kids?

598
00:54:39,046 --> 00:54:40,347
And then what should they be doing on their own?

599
00:54:40,467 --> 00:54:41,167
What should they be learning?

600
00:54:41,791 --> 00:54:47,894
So the question was, how do we bring game development to kids, even if they're in high school, what are the most important things?

601
00:54:48,774 --> 00:54:50,115
I think we probably all have opinions.

602
00:54:50,135 --> 00:54:55,058
I would say, honestly, game development is very much a team effort, right?

603
00:54:55,078 --> 00:55:02,241
You've got your disciplines, art, design, engineering, sound, QA, all these different people need to work together.

604
00:55:02,841 --> 00:55:03,261
Production.

605
00:55:06,767 --> 00:55:06,847
I'm

606
00:55:28,898 --> 00:55:32,021
and also just like have a way for them to showcase it, right?

607
00:55:32,861 --> 00:55:41,268
Maybe there's a website for the class where they can put their website or put the games that they make or something at the end of a semester where they get to show off their games to other classes.

608
00:55:41,748 --> 00:55:45,051
I think that would be really awesome and sort of like energize people to work towards something.

609
00:55:45,511 --> 00:55:49,034
And the final thing I'll say is ask them to keep the scope as small as possible.

610
00:55:49,454 --> 00:55:52,917
When they propose something, like have them do the MVP, right?

611
00:55:52,937 --> 00:55:54,378
Yeah, and that's huge.

612
00:55:54,698 --> 00:56:07,892
And on that note, I think it's awesome that you're diving into VR development, but all those principles about working as a team and being a different role on the team apply if you make them develop a board game.

613
00:56:08,453 --> 00:56:16,622
So you can easily teach all of those things by having them modify Monopoly to be a better game, or whatever it is, make a new game from scratch.

614
00:56:16,792 --> 00:56:17,353
Yeah, exactly.

615
00:56:17,393 --> 00:56:19,094
Don't be afraid to lower that barrier of entry.

616
00:56:20,015 --> 00:56:30,245
In the Pittsburgh IGDA, we have a board game jam and we have the global game jam, which, you know, video games and board games and like you're making games and it doesn't matter the media and board games certainly has a lower barrier of entry.

617
00:56:30,565 --> 00:56:31,426
Although VR is also.

618
00:56:32,667 --> 00:56:32,968
Thank you.

619
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:44,992
Hi, I'm Richard from USC and the question I want to ask is that do you mind sharing some data on the per-session user play length for a mouse VR?

620
00:56:45,152 --> 00:56:51,995
When I say per-session, it's like the first when they first enter a game and then by the time they finish like a lot of games and lock out of VR because

621
00:56:52,996 --> 00:57:11,078
I'm also doing a multiplayer VR game and what I found is that when they have like friends enter together with them like in the lobby for example they have three or four friends together the playlines will kind of increase I don't know if that's like a validation because we don't have any big bigger or playtest data so do you mind sharing some of that information?

622
00:57:12,370 --> 00:57:14,711
Yeah, I do like the analytics.

623
00:57:15,972 --> 00:57:19,594
We don't have an insight, I guess, in what you described, which is really interesting, right?

624
00:57:19,614 --> 00:57:23,236
So the question was, hey, how long is a player session in a multiplayer game like this?

625
00:57:23,636 --> 00:57:28,698
And does it vary if they entered with a bunch of friends in play versus they're just matchmaking with random people?

626
00:57:29,239 --> 00:57:31,400
So I don't have that insight for our game.

627
00:57:31,420 --> 00:57:34,421
Like I don't know, right, if you're playing in

628
00:57:36,169 --> 00:57:36,389
you know

629
00:57:53,860 --> 00:57:54,000
Got it.

630
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:54,541
Thank you.

631
00:58:11,860 --> 00:58:16,385
Hi, I just wanted some clarification on the minimum viable product.

632
00:58:16,546 --> 00:58:26,778
So is that solely documentation or does that also include like a vertical slice playtestable build that the team can get their hands on before pre-production ends?

633
00:58:27,489 --> 00:58:31,371
Yeah, ideally I would say it should have had a vertical slice in there.

634
00:58:31,691 --> 00:58:34,952
With our networking challenges, we didn't get there as far as we would like.

635
00:58:35,292 --> 00:58:37,813
So the documentation certainly is paramount, right?

636
00:58:37,854 --> 00:58:49,479
So even if you weren't able to meet that on that technical gameplay side of things, having that documentation, having that be kind of your Bible, if you will, North Star for the project is still important too.

637
00:58:49,539 --> 00:58:51,219
And we made up for it, right?

638
00:58:51,239 --> 00:58:54,521
Like then we're working towards, you know, figuring out the rest of those milestones and how to plan that out.

639
00:58:55,261 --> 00:58:55,541
Thank you.

640
00:58:55,561 --> 00:58:56,182
Yeah, of course.

641
00:58:56,302 --> 00:58:58,304
Yeah, the MVP helps set the team expectations.

642
00:58:58,384 --> 00:58:59,185
Yes, correct.

643
00:58:59,325 --> 00:58:59,505
Yeah.

644
00:58:59,525 --> 00:59:01,747
Hi, really enjoyed the talk.

645
00:59:01,807 --> 00:59:02,147
Thank you.

646
00:59:02,287 --> 00:59:10,595
I was just wondering what it was like working with someone else's IP and because this was InnerSloth's IP, how much of a hand did they play into production?

647
00:59:11,073 --> 00:59:12,434
Yeah, no, it's interesting.

648
00:59:13,735 --> 00:59:19,700
And again, there was so much that we wanted to make sure that we stayed sacred to in this whole story.

649
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:25,764
So with InnerSloth, we met up with them just right at the beginning and not very frequently throughout.

650
00:59:26,205 --> 00:59:27,766
They had hired a company, Robot Teddy,

651
00:59:28,166 --> 00:59:28,306
talk

652
00:59:46,753 --> 00:59:49,214
and what we had to, again, just stay very beholden to.

653
00:59:49,935 --> 00:59:59,620
So I've worked with several big IP holders and making sure you kind of uncover that right up front just makes that really good for us to understand, like, OK, how much of this is ours and how much is yours?

654
00:59:59,980 --> 01:00:02,942
How much creative input do you actually want to have and how much freedom do we have?

655
01:00:03,322 --> 01:00:05,883
And so we just had that real conversation, right?

656
01:00:06,003 --> 01:00:09,465
Very real come to Jesus conversation right up front to establish that early on.

657
01:00:09,525 --> 01:00:12,547
And yeah, again, they just really wanted us to

658
01:00:13,832 --> 01:00:13,852
a

659
01:00:37,332 --> 01:00:37,772
It was great.

660
01:00:37,852 --> 01:00:42,035
I mean, it was great setting the expectations and then it also helped that they were great to work with.

661
01:00:42,075 --> 01:00:42,735
That was really nice.

662
01:00:42,855 --> 01:00:44,716
Yeah, it gave us a lot of freedom.

663
01:00:44,916 --> 01:00:49,078
And again, with just the amount of time that we had, though, we just knew that priority needed to be getting it to market.

664
01:00:49,098 --> 01:00:53,861
So we just wanted to, you know, stay true to just allowed a lot of that.

665
01:00:53,941 --> 01:00:57,583
So question.

666
01:00:58,163 --> 01:00:59,964
Yeah.

667
01:01:00,004 --> 01:01:04,747
People are immersed so that things and to like,

668
01:01:07,918 --> 01:01:36,070
whereas that doesn't happen in nine choices new workflows much more collaborative and taking having one person take well in there it's a night did we do any design choice playing a VR game which is then mobile

669
01:01:37,867 --> 01:01:39,208
the the game times of

670
01:02:01,130 --> 01:02:03,612
We had a, there's a mode to play without voice chat.

671
01:02:03,852 --> 01:02:09,357
So if that's too much for you and if you don't want to be needing to listen to other people constantly, you can do that.

672
01:02:09,397 --> 01:02:14,282
And then there's a chat, like there's a text, you know, uh, pre canned, like text responses stuff.

673
01:02:15,343 --> 01:02:20,187
And, uh, I think there's something else, but it just slipped my mind.

674
01:02:21,163 --> 01:02:22,543
It's definitely something to keep in mind, though.

675
01:02:22,563 --> 01:02:23,544
It's a good question.

676
01:02:23,664 --> 01:02:28,665
But an easy game, just like the 2D game, which we affectionately call the flat game, that you can just kind of jump in and out of, right?

677
01:02:28,705 --> 01:02:35,367
So on the mobile game, like, I feel like I'll join and then, you know, just maybe do one match and I'm out and then I can jump back in whenever, right?

678
01:02:35,407 --> 01:02:47,770
We set it up similar in that way where, again... The choice is to not have a browser, you know, a server browser, to not have custom matches at launch so you don't have to think about, oh, no, are these pro players doing crazy things, you know, with settings that I don't understand.

679
01:02:48,110 --> 01:02:51,391
you know, we made it really easy for you to just hit play and start playing.

680
01:02:53,991 --> 01:02:56,532
All right, I think we are out of time, but yes, we will be in the wrap-up room.

681
01:02:56,892 --> 01:02:58,393
Again, thank you all very much for coming.

682
01:02:58,473 --> 01:02:59,393
Fill out your e-mails.
