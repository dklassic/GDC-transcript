1
00:00:12,293 --> 00:00:13,194
My name is Ben Broad.

2
00:00:13,214 --> 00:00:14,756
I've got to click here.

3
00:00:14,776 --> 00:00:15,256
Okay, here we go.

4
00:00:17,178 --> 00:00:18,160
Let me make sure my clicker works.

5
00:00:21,311 --> 00:00:21,831
There we go, okay.

6
00:00:22,351 --> 00:00:23,912
I'm the Chief Development Officer at Second Dinner,

7
00:00:24,632 --> 00:00:27,814
where over the last five years, we made Marvel Snap.

8
00:00:28,194 --> 00:00:30,635
Before that, I spent the last 15 years at Blizzard,

9
00:00:31,335 --> 00:00:33,436
doing QA and other things for Warcraft 3,

10
00:00:33,816 --> 00:00:35,777
World of Warcraft, Diablo 2, and some other stuff.

11
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,398
But I spent most of my time there on Hearthstone,

12
00:00:38,858 --> 00:00:41,319
where I was the first game designer,

13
00:00:41,539 --> 00:00:43,400
and eventually the game director on that game.

14
00:00:44,581 --> 00:00:47,142
I also have a successful rap career on YouTube,

15
00:00:49,143 --> 00:00:50,663
but I'm mostly known for having a weird laugh.

16
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:53,002
This is holding up better than I thought.

17
00:00:53,543 --> 00:00:54,243
So far, so good.

18
00:00:54,323 --> 00:00:54,844
OK.

19
00:00:55,865 --> 00:00:56,145
OK.

20
00:00:56,706 --> 00:01:01,350
So this talk is about how we designed Marvel Snap.

21
00:01:02,211 --> 00:01:03,572
It took us a little over four years.

22
00:01:04,253 --> 00:01:06,996
And over the next hour, I'm going to talk about everything

23
00:01:07,016 --> 00:01:09,999
we tried, the stuff that worked, the stuff that didn't work,

24
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:12,581
and everything I learned from that process,

25
00:01:12,941 --> 00:01:16,184
mostly about the core gameplay of Marvel Snap.

26
00:01:16,896 --> 00:01:18,456
And I was going to show you an outline,

27
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:19,477
but instead I'm just going to show you

28
00:01:19,557 --> 00:01:20,717
every slide in the presentation.

29
00:01:20,757 --> 00:01:21,037
That's it.

30
00:01:21,077 --> 00:01:21,937
That's the whole presentation.

31
00:01:22,558 --> 00:01:24,598
And as you can see, there's no cute cat images,

32
00:01:24,638 --> 00:01:26,299
so keep your expectations low, please.

33
00:01:27,879 --> 00:01:32,441
Marvel Snap is a mobile first super fast digital collectible

34
00:01:32,461 --> 00:01:34,921
card game where players compete to win two out of three

35
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:36,882
locations by playing cards to locations

36
00:01:36,942 --> 00:01:39,503
and trying to add up all their power from their cards

37
00:01:39,523 --> 00:01:41,043
to get the highest total power on their side.

38
00:01:41,063 --> 00:01:43,964
We did some crazy stuff like make all of our cards in 3D.

39
00:01:46,586 --> 00:01:51,314
One of the biggest things we did is add this cool betting and bluffing mechanic with the cube,

40
00:01:51,334 --> 00:01:53,819
where you could snap on it to double the stakes of the game.

41
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,223
How many of you all have tried Marble Snap?

42
00:01:57,786 --> 00:01:59,429
Wow, okay, I'll buy you a copy, sir.

43
00:02:02,128 --> 00:02:03,749
OK, so step one, inspiration.

44
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:05,791
Designers are like chefs.

45
00:02:06,451 --> 00:02:08,792
For the most part, we don't invent new ingredients.

46
00:02:08,852 --> 00:02:11,414
We take ingredients that already exist

47
00:02:11,454 --> 00:02:13,615
and combine them in new and exciting ways.

48
00:02:13,675 --> 00:02:17,437
For example, you might give two different chefs flour, water,

49
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:19,598
tomato, basil, and cheese.

50
00:02:19,918 --> 00:02:21,139
And one of them might make pizza.

51
00:02:21,639 --> 00:02:22,840
The other one might make pasta.

52
00:02:23,020 --> 00:02:25,621
But the pasta chef wouldn't go to the pizza chef and say,

53
00:02:26,122 --> 00:02:26,342
Ray.

54
00:02:27,162 --> 00:02:28,364
I invented flour.

55
00:02:29,044 --> 00:02:29,805
That's my thing.

56
00:02:29,825 --> 00:02:31,207
You took flour from me.

57
00:02:32,348 --> 00:02:33,789
It's not about inventing new ingredients.

58
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,551
It's about how we mix them.

59
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:38,474
And sometimes people find really exciting ways

60
00:02:38,934 --> 00:02:41,657
to mix old ingredients, like this fellow online I found

61
00:02:41,737 --> 00:02:43,920
who has a recipe for basil tomato cheesecake.

62
00:02:46,487 --> 00:02:51,095
So as fans of games, we gather ingredients naturally as we play games.

63
00:02:51,776 --> 00:02:56,544
But I wanted to talk about how I approach ingredient gathering differently as I start

64
00:02:56,584 --> 00:02:57,185
a new project.

65
00:02:58,161 --> 00:02:59,802
So I'm going to talk about how we did this for Marvel Snap.

66
00:03:00,102 --> 00:03:01,562
But one of the things we tried on Snap,

67
00:03:01,582 --> 00:03:04,043
some of the things we tried on Snap were either

68
00:03:04,563 --> 00:03:07,725
the result of lessons I learned on my time on Hearthstone

69
00:03:07,745 --> 00:03:08,605
that worked really well for us,

70
00:03:09,085 --> 00:03:11,326
or the result of some hard lessons I learned

71
00:03:11,426 --> 00:03:12,286
while on Hearthstone that I wanted to do

72
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:13,707
a little differently for Snap.

73
00:03:13,727 --> 00:03:15,368
So I'm going to tell a few Hearthstone stories

74
00:03:15,988 --> 00:03:18,449
along the way here, starting with my first visit

75
00:03:18,469 --> 00:03:20,529
to the supermarket 15 years ago.

76
00:03:21,430 --> 00:03:21,610
So,

77
00:03:24,502 --> 00:03:26,303
Fifteen years ago is when we started working on Hearthstone,

78
00:03:26,323 --> 00:03:28,184
and this is before the App Store existed,

79
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:30,785
before the iPad was announced.

80
00:03:31,065 --> 00:03:32,546
In 2008, when people talked about mobile games,

81
00:03:32,566 --> 00:03:34,007
we were talking about Game Boy games.

82
00:03:34,968 --> 00:03:37,769
So the first thing I did when I joined the Hearthstone team

83
00:03:38,049 --> 00:03:40,311
was play literally every game

84
00:03:40,451 --> 00:03:42,152
in the digital collectible card game genre.

85
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,181
And I learned a ton from playing these games.

86
00:03:45,201 --> 00:03:47,222
Sometimes I found a new ingredient I was excited to try.

87
00:03:47,723 --> 00:03:49,784
Sometimes I just found out I didn't like onions or something.

88
00:03:50,384 --> 00:03:51,585
But that's still really valuable.

89
00:03:51,605 --> 00:03:56,628
For example, I didn't know that I wouldn't enjoy a grid-based card combat system

90
00:03:56,728 --> 00:03:59,330
in the collectible card game until I played all these games.

91
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:03,192
And it's way cheaper to learn that lesson by playing someone else's games

92
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,153
than to prototype it yourself and learn it that way.

93
00:04:06,494 --> 00:04:09,076
But despite there having been a fair number of digital collectible card games in 2008,

94
00:04:09,276 --> 00:04:12,097
most of the inspirations for Hearthstone came from physical games.

95
00:04:12,862 --> 00:04:15,703
So here's the recipe for Hearthstone's core gameplay.

96
00:04:16,303 --> 00:04:19,044
We took a lot of ingredients from the World of Warcraft trading card game,

97
00:04:19,124 --> 00:04:23,025
like the card types, direct attacking, sticky damage, the win condition,

98
00:04:23,685 --> 00:04:26,086
a really important ingredient from Battle Spirits,

99
00:04:26,586 --> 00:04:29,247
which is being re-released soon, which is the mana system,

100
00:04:29,587 --> 00:04:31,148
and then we came up with a few important innovations,

101
00:04:31,188 --> 00:04:34,469
like hero powers, no responses, weapon durability, fatigue mechanic,

102
00:04:34,909 --> 00:04:35,969
and general low complexity.

103
00:04:37,288 --> 00:04:40,849
So I asked Mike Elliott, who is the designer on Battle Spirits,

104
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:43,290
how he comes up with new ideas for games.

105
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:45,651
Because he's designed like hundreds of board and card

106
00:04:45,671 --> 00:04:45,911
games.

107
00:04:46,752 --> 00:04:48,552
And I have not designed hundreds of games.

108
00:04:48,592 --> 00:04:49,312
So I was like, how do you do it?

109
00:04:50,173 --> 00:04:52,494
And he told me he gets all of his game ideas

110
00:04:53,034 --> 00:04:54,274
from games conventions.

111
00:04:55,195 --> 00:04:57,576
He just walks the show floor, where everyone's

112
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,697
showing off all their new stuff that they've been working on.

113
00:05:01,237 --> 00:05:02,698
And he just lets ideas come to him.

114
00:05:02,718 --> 00:05:03,458
He just soaks them up.

115
00:05:03,478 --> 00:05:04,258
And when he leaves the convention,

116
00:05:04,298 --> 00:05:06,099
he has 12 new ideas for games.

117
00:05:07,109 --> 00:05:09,330
This is a supermarket, it's full of ingredients.

118
00:05:10,771 --> 00:05:12,132
So this is a picture of Gen Con,

119
00:05:12,212 --> 00:05:15,574
where I went in 2008 or nine,

120
00:05:15,814 --> 00:05:17,115
and this is where I discovered Battle Spirits,

121
00:05:17,135 --> 00:05:19,516
which ended up becoming a big inspiration for Hearthstone.

122
00:05:20,116 --> 00:05:22,097
So I used Mike's technique to find

123
00:05:22,137 --> 00:05:23,378
and become inspired by his game,

124
00:05:23,398 --> 00:05:24,078
which I thought was kinda cool.

125
00:05:25,685 --> 00:05:28,006
So I worked on Hearthstone for about six years before it shipped,

126
00:05:28,446 --> 00:05:31,167
but I missed the launch party for Hearthstone,

127
00:05:31,187 --> 00:05:32,427
because my son was born that day.

128
00:05:33,047 --> 00:05:35,668
And we hadn't launched on mobile yet,

129
00:05:35,688 --> 00:05:38,649
but I got a special build of the game on my phone,

130
00:05:39,509 --> 00:05:41,109
and I spent a lot of time playing Hearthstone on my phone

131
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:42,310
while I was holding my son in the other hand.

132
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:45,830
And that really changed the way that I could play games.

133
00:05:45,870 --> 00:05:48,451
I couldn't just sit in front of my computer for four hours raiding.

134
00:05:48,471 --> 00:05:52,252
I had to get my games in while at the park or on the bathroom.

135
00:05:53,606 --> 00:05:55,747
So Clash Royale came out a couple years later,

136
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:58,188
and I was super jealous of Clash Royale,

137
00:05:58,208 --> 00:05:59,909
because if you have five minutes,

138
00:05:59,929 --> 00:06:02,690
you are 100% sure you can get a game of Clash Royale in.

139
00:06:03,851 --> 00:06:04,912
I thought that was just brilliant.

140
00:06:05,872 --> 00:06:08,393
And then five years ago, Hamilton and I,

141
00:06:08,413 --> 00:06:10,314
Hamilton was the EP at Hearthstone,

142
00:06:10,334 --> 00:06:11,315
he's the CEO of Second Dinner,

143
00:06:12,035 --> 00:06:14,516
set out to build a new company, try something new.

144
00:06:15,294 --> 00:06:19,782
And we didn't know that we were going to make a collectible card game.

145
00:06:20,283 --> 00:06:23,529
But once we decided to do that, I once again found myself playing

146
00:06:24,150 --> 00:06:26,074
every mobile digital collectible card game I could find.

147
00:06:26,916 --> 00:06:27,997
So here's all the games I was playing in 2018.

148
00:06:28,177 --> 00:06:32,059
And that game on the left, Card Monsters 3 Minute Duels,

149
00:06:32,899 --> 00:06:33,479
is really cool.

150
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:35,140
It's a, has anyone played that game?

151
00:06:36,141 --> 00:06:37,061
Oh my gosh, what up?

152
00:06:37,621 --> 00:06:38,562
We probably fought on the ladder.

153
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,903
So I, it's great.

154
00:06:41,943 --> 00:06:45,285
It's a vertical, mobile, digital, collectible card game.

155
00:06:45,485 --> 00:06:48,227
And in some ways it was the proof I was looking for

156
00:06:48,587 --> 00:06:49,907
that there was something really cool in the space.

157
00:06:51,428 --> 00:06:53,109
So what was the recipe?

158
00:06:53,809 --> 00:06:55,270
Wow, my voice is better when I talk deep.

159
00:06:56,444 --> 00:06:58,246
What was the recipe for Marvel Snap?

160
00:06:58,666 --> 00:07:00,829
What ingredients did we gather?

161
00:07:01,229 --> 00:07:04,813
This is the mystery I'm setting up to pull you all through the rest of my presentation here.

162
00:07:06,795 --> 00:07:11,920
So we had a bunch of ingredients running around in our heads and it was time to prototype.

163
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:18,386
So this is what the first prototype for Marvel Snap looked like.

164
00:07:21,629 --> 00:07:22,090
I'm serious.

165
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:25,732
OK, so we were sitting around brainstorming game ideas,

166
00:07:26,173 --> 00:07:28,174
and Hamilton said, you know, I've always wanted to play

167
00:07:28,194 --> 00:07:32,117
a turn-based strategy game with the backgammon doubling cube.

168
00:07:33,098 --> 00:07:36,220
And so I booted up Hearthstone, and every turn of the game,

169
00:07:36,260 --> 00:07:39,423
Hamilton said, would you double the cube right now?

170
00:07:39,943 --> 00:07:42,345
If your opponent doubled the cube, would you concede?

171
00:07:43,206 --> 00:07:47,869
And we got to immediately feel the impact of that mechanic

172
00:07:47,909 --> 00:07:49,791
without having to build anything.

173
00:07:50,682 --> 00:07:54,025
And through those initial playtests, we realized a couple things about this doubling mechanic.

174
00:07:54,805 --> 00:07:56,467
It increased the emotional range, right?

175
00:07:56,487 --> 00:08:00,330
Instead of just one star per match, you're playing for potentially a lot more stars.

176
00:08:01,151 --> 00:08:02,752
We spent less time losing, right?

177
00:08:02,792 --> 00:08:06,896
In a normal game, if you have like a 5% chance to win, you've got to play that all the way out, right?

178
00:08:06,916 --> 00:08:07,917
Because you might win.

179
00:08:08,537 --> 00:08:12,981
And that period of time where you're like probably going to lose can be pretty grueling.

180
00:08:13,422 --> 00:08:15,143
Like the final six hours of a game of Monopoly.

181
00:08:16,966 --> 00:08:19,968
But when you're incentivized to bail out because you're going to lose less cubes,

182
00:08:19,988 --> 00:08:23,249
you can just leave and you spend less time in that grueling zone.

183
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,611
Games that you don't play all the way to completion are faster, obviously.

184
00:08:27,451 --> 00:08:31,654
But there was two other things that I think had a really big impact that I'm going to dig into a little bit more.

185
00:08:32,154 --> 00:08:34,355
So the first is zero sum is zero fun.

186
00:08:34,695 --> 00:08:37,877
If two players play a game and one of them wins and the other loses,

187
00:08:38,297 --> 00:08:45,561
and it is as fun to win as it is not fun to lose, you have created net zero joy.

188
00:08:46,515 --> 00:08:50,196
You just moved happiness from one person to another.

189
00:08:51,816 --> 00:08:54,317
So we were trying to avoid this situation.

190
00:08:54,337 --> 00:08:55,697
There's a bunch of ways to tackle this.

191
00:08:56,257 --> 00:08:57,297
The first is bots.

192
00:08:57,578 --> 00:08:59,178
It's one of the easiest ways to avoid zero-sum

193
00:08:59,218 --> 00:09:00,758
because you just have a player who's winning

194
00:09:00,798 --> 00:09:01,439
and nobody's losing.

195
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:04,179
So I really like PUBG Mobile.

196
00:09:04,199 --> 00:09:05,160
I play a lot of PUBG Mobile

197
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,660
and the first time I played it,

198
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:07,980
I got first place.

199
00:09:09,153 --> 00:09:11,834
And the second time I played it, I got first place again,

200
00:09:11,854 --> 00:09:12,854
out of 100 people.

201
00:09:12,894 --> 00:09:13,754
And I started thinking, you know,

202
00:09:13,774 --> 00:09:15,275
I used to play Eliminate on iOS,

203
00:09:15,315 --> 00:09:17,435
and I played Metroid Prime Hunters on Nintendo DS.

204
00:09:17,775 --> 00:09:19,616
Maybe these skills are coming back to me

205
00:09:20,116 --> 00:09:20,896
after all these years.

206
00:09:20,976 --> 00:09:23,096
And so I posted this screenshot on Facebook,

207
00:09:23,456 --> 00:09:25,537
and I was like, guys, I just won my first two games

208
00:09:25,597 --> 00:09:28,117
of PUBG Mobile, I'm so good, which is a little annoying.

209
00:09:28,538 --> 00:09:30,698
And all my friends jumped on in the comments,

210
00:09:30,738 --> 00:09:34,499
like, dude, you played 100% bots in those first two games.

211
00:09:34,659 --> 00:09:36,779
And I was embarrassed, so I deleted the post.

212
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:44,925
But if they hadn't told me, I would have experienced all of the joy of victory without any of the agony of defeat.

213
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,607
So instead I just have to bask in the joy of having a rad-looking character avatar.

214
00:09:51,350 --> 00:09:58,515
So at GDC 2014, my mentor and the original game director of Hearthstone, Eric Douds, gave a talk about Hearthstone design values.

215
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:00,176
He talked about little victories.

216
00:10:01,162 --> 00:10:03,985
The big victory is whether you win or lose the game.

217
00:10:04,625 --> 00:10:06,487
And the little victories are things that happen

218
00:10:06,527 --> 00:10:08,169
during the game, anything that makes you feel smart

219
00:10:08,229 --> 00:10:08,729
or powerful.

220
00:10:08,769 --> 00:10:10,171
So imagine playing a game of Counter-Strike

221
00:10:10,891 --> 00:10:12,072
and you come out of this spawn point

222
00:10:12,092 --> 00:10:13,173
and someone headshots you and you die.

223
00:10:13,647 --> 00:10:16,909
You had no moment where you felt smart or powerful during that game.

224
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:19,191
But let's imagine you're playing the game of Counter-Strike and you run out

225
00:10:19,211 --> 00:10:20,933
and you're just blowing up everyone on the enemy team,

226
00:10:21,033 --> 00:10:24,616
and eventually you lose, but you still felt, like, awesome while you were doing it.

227
00:10:25,436 --> 00:10:26,257
That's little victories.

228
00:10:26,697 --> 00:10:30,681
So, essentially, little victories add a little joy, even if you lose.

229
00:10:31,321 --> 00:10:35,642
So on Hearthstone, we avoided cards that blow up enemy mana crystals or force your opponent to discard cards

230
00:10:36,042 --> 00:10:40,083
because they could potentially create scenarios where you never get to feel powerful.

231
00:10:40,543 --> 00:10:43,183
And in Marvel Snap, there's six turns. You always get to play six turns.

232
00:10:43,203 --> 00:10:47,464
You always get to do something. You get to play some of your cards and feel a little bit powerful while you do it.

233
00:10:49,484 --> 00:10:54,325
But the cube had one of the biggest impacts on the zero-sum paradigm.

234
00:10:55,346 --> 00:10:57,186
So we found that when your opponent snaps...

235
00:10:58,304 --> 00:11:01,025
and you retreat, it could feel like this.

236
00:11:02,145 --> 00:11:04,586
In some cases, it made losing feel like victory.

237
00:11:05,106 --> 00:11:07,546
It's a strategic retreat where you don't fall victim

238
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:08,706
to your opponent's gambit.

239
00:11:09,327 --> 00:11:10,807
And we realized we could emphasize this

240
00:11:10,827 --> 00:11:11,907
with some presentation changes.

241
00:11:11,987 --> 00:11:13,668
So this is what the Get Seen button used to look like.

242
00:11:13,688 --> 00:11:15,008
Here's what it looks like now.

243
00:11:15,748 --> 00:11:17,509
Here's what it used to look like when you retreated,

244
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,689
and here's what it looks like now.

245
00:11:18,909 --> 00:11:21,009
You didn't lose, you escaped.

246
00:11:21,589 --> 00:11:22,430
You're a genius.

247
00:11:25,393 --> 00:11:27,895
So this presentation stuff works in reverse as well.

248
00:11:27,955 --> 00:11:30,777
When you lost a game, we used to have the announcer go,

249
00:11:31,177 --> 00:11:32,258
you lose.

250
00:11:32,798 --> 00:11:35,220
And we cut that because it's emphasizing exactly

251
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,481
the emotions we're trying to minimize.

252
00:11:38,142 --> 00:11:40,544
So the effects on the zero-sum problem were encouraging.

253
00:11:40,724 --> 00:11:44,427
But the really game-changing effects of the cube

254
00:11:44,447 --> 00:11:44,947
was the depth.

255
00:11:45,428 --> 00:11:46,248
Please excuse me for one second.

256
00:11:50,169 --> 00:11:57,476
So we often talk about poker as a game that is never required an expansion to remain strategically deep for decades.

257
00:11:58,697 --> 00:12:00,999
And it's because of the power of betting and bluffing mechanics.

258
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:11,769
So Hearthstone with a doubling cube is all of the depth of Hearthstone plus all of the depth of these betting and bluffing mechanics.

259
00:12:12,494 --> 00:12:14,154
And we thought, hey, what if we could reduce

260
00:12:14,795 --> 00:12:19,316
the complexity of the genre and lean on the cube mechanic

261
00:12:19,376 --> 00:12:21,656
to make up for some of the depth that we'd lose

262
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:22,676
by simplifying the genre?

263
00:12:23,537 --> 00:12:25,177
So with that insight, we set out to build

264
00:12:25,217 --> 00:12:26,617
the simplest card game we could

265
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:29,018
that would allow for us to use a doubling cube.

266
00:12:30,038 --> 00:12:31,978
So I love games that are simple and have a lot of depth.

267
00:12:32,919 --> 00:12:34,019
A lot of people use these words,

268
00:12:34,219 --> 00:12:35,219
complexity and depth, differently.

269
00:12:35,239 --> 00:12:36,359
So here's how I'm gonna define them today.

270
00:12:36,679 --> 00:12:38,720
Complexity is the cost you pay

271
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:40,260
before you can play the game.

272
00:12:41,272 --> 00:12:42,513
It's the learning you have to do.

273
00:12:43,274 --> 00:12:44,836
Depth is the fun part.

274
00:12:44,916 --> 00:12:45,877
It's the interesting decisions.

275
00:12:47,258 --> 00:12:49,099
So here's a review we got on Metacritic

276
00:12:49,119 --> 00:12:50,000
when we launched Hearthstone.

277
00:12:51,121 --> 00:12:52,963
And this was a common criticism at the time

278
00:12:52,983 --> 00:12:53,904
when we first came out with the game.

279
00:12:54,284 --> 00:12:55,365
And I think it's because a lot of people

280
00:12:55,465 --> 00:12:57,287
misunderstand the relationship

281
00:12:57,667 --> 00:12:59,269
between complexity and depth.

282
00:13:00,203 --> 00:13:05,666
A lot of players want deep games, and it's true that you have to add complexity to add depth.

283
00:13:05,686 --> 00:13:10,769
So people see games with lots of complexity, and they assume it's got the depth that they're looking for in a game.

284
00:13:11,490 --> 00:13:14,352
But you can add complexity that doesn't add any depth.

285
00:13:14,772 --> 00:13:19,435
For example, if we had a rule that says every time you play a card in Marvel Snap,

286
00:13:19,475 --> 00:13:24,098
you have to yell the name of your card into the microphone or you lose, that's an important rule.

287
00:13:24,378 --> 00:13:27,640
You have to learn that rule, but it doesn't add any interesting depth to the game.

288
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,170
On the other end, there's complexity that yields an outsized amount of depth.

289
00:13:32,552 --> 00:13:37,153
We often call mechanics that yield a lot of depth for a small amount of complexity, elegant designs.

290
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:42,454
For example, Tic-Tac-Toe is a game that has very little complexity and also very low depth.

291
00:13:42,954 --> 00:13:46,495
Go has a little bit more complexity, has a humongous amount more depth.

292
00:13:46,915 --> 00:13:54,296
Monopoly has only a little bit more depth than Tic-Tac-Toe in my opinion, but a lot more depth.

293
00:13:55,256 --> 00:13:58,217
This top right box, I chose Magic the Gathering because it has a huge amount of depth,

294
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:01,357
but also AI researchers called it the world's most complex game.

295
00:14:03,579 --> 00:14:08,980
So you can mitigate adding more depth by slowly introducing new concepts over time, right?

296
00:14:09,781 --> 00:14:14,982
And if you get more depth by adding complexity, shouldn't you just keep adding more complexity to get more of that depth?

297
00:14:15,802 --> 00:14:18,423
I actually think there's a depth limit.

298
00:14:19,523 --> 00:14:24,324
If your game already takes a lifetime to master, what does adding more depth get you?

299
00:14:24,884 --> 00:14:27,145
More lifetimes? You only get one.

300
00:14:28,185 --> 00:14:30,746
So I think the goal is, how do you reach the depth limit?

301
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,211
with the smallest amount of complexity.

302
00:14:33,872 --> 00:14:35,332
So if your game has this much depth,

303
00:14:36,473 --> 00:14:39,574
perhaps you should remove complexity and depth

304
00:14:40,055 --> 00:14:41,235
until you get there.

305
00:14:41,255 --> 00:14:43,136
I hope the little star is visible there.

306
00:14:44,237 --> 00:14:47,498
However, removing complexity can have a weird effect

307
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:48,599
on your team.

308
00:14:50,194 --> 00:14:55,739
So, in early Hearthstone, taunt was supposed to be a one-time effect.

309
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:58,702
If you attacked an enemy minion with taunt, it would lose taunt.

310
00:14:59,403 --> 00:15:02,706
And there was a bug one day where that stopped working, and it just kept taunt forever.

311
00:15:03,226 --> 00:15:07,250
And we thought about it, and we said, you know, this is simpler if they just keep taunt forever.

312
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:09,972
They just always have taunt. So let's just not fix the bug.

313
00:15:10,773 --> 00:15:13,153
And a lot of members on the team came up to us and said,

314
00:15:13,173 --> 00:15:15,934
hey, the game just got a lot less deep.

315
00:15:16,614 --> 00:15:18,374
There's all this really interesting combat decisions

316
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:21,115
where you're trying to drop taunt in the correct order.

317
00:15:21,895 --> 00:15:24,415
And they're not wrong.

318
00:15:25,716 --> 00:15:26,256
It's less deep.

319
00:15:27,156 --> 00:15:28,916
But the thing is, the team had already

320
00:15:28,956 --> 00:15:32,417
paid all of the complexity cost to learn how this works.

321
00:15:32,937 --> 00:15:35,017
So when you remove complexity, they only

322
00:15:35,157 --> 00:15:37,178
feel the resulting loss of depth.

323
00:15:38,993 --> 00:15:41,194
So I've been talking a lot about rules complexity,

324
00:15:41,875 --> 00:15:44,015
but you know what matters even more than rules complexity?

325
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:45,756
Text complexity.

326
00:15:46,356 --> 00:15:48,917
This is the filter through which people

327
00:15:49,397 --> 00:15:50,818
will learn the rules of your game.

328
00:15:51,358 --> 00:15:53,739
And you can make the game seem much simpler or much more

329
00:15:53,779 --> 00:15:55,820
complicated depending on how you explain it.

330
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:57,100
And we've all felt this when we sit down

331
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,321
to play a board game with our friends,

332
00:15:58,921 --> 00:16:00,962
and you're just baffled at the end of the explanation.

333
00:16:00,982 --> 00:16:02,122
You're like, let's just play one turn.

334
00:16:03,901 --> 00:16:08,907
So this talk by George Fan at the 2012 entitled

335
00:16:08,947 --> 00:16:10,569
How I Got My Mom to Play Through Plants vs. Zombies

336
00:16:10,929 --> 00:16:12,751
is the best GDC talk of all time.

337
00:16:13,212 --> 00:16:14,193
It's fantastic, yeah.

338
00:16:14,793 --> 00:16:17,376
And this slide was mind-blowing to me.

339
00:16:17,577 --> 00:16:20,019
If you put more than eight words on the screen,

340
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:21,781
players will not read them.

341
00:16:23,321 --> 00:16:23,861
I think he's right.

342
00:16:24,022 --> 00:16:28,687
And so here is every tooltip in the first 15 minutes of Marvel Snap.

343
00:16:29,508 --> 00:16:32,311
And here are the word counts for each tooltip.

344
00:16:32,871 --> 00:16:34,694
And I'm very excited about this.

345
00:16:34,854 --> 00:16:40,140
There's some flavor dialogue that comes up that is more than eight words every once in a while.

346
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:42,863
But I don't care if you don't read that stuff, because it's just flavor.

347
00:16:42,923 --> 00:16:44,464
This is the important stuff that you need to learn.

348
00:16:46,421 --> 00:16:49,365
The thing that's really hard to do is card text.

349
00:16:49,886 --> 00:16:52,909
So we realized that on Hearthstone, for a digital game,

350
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:55,813
we didn't need to write out as much of the edge case stuff.

351
00:16:55,853 --> 00:17:01,279
So your hero deals two fire damage to target hero or ally became deal two damage.

352
00:17:02,904 --> 00:17:05,865
The average word count for Hearthstone was nine words,

353
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:10,328
and for Snap it's eleven, partially because we don't use keywords.

354
00:17:11,769 --> 00:17:14,570
So we've fallen short of the George Fan ideal there, which makes me sad.

355
00:17:15,551 --> 00:17:17,632
But to make sure that text complexity stayed low,

356
00:17:18,092 --> 00:17:20,654
we would audition our cards with people,

357
00:17:20,694 --> 00:17:22,355
we would sit them down and show them the cards,

358
00:17:22,395 --> 00:17:26,197
and if you had to read a card more than one time,

359
00:17:26,617 --> 00:17:28,238
we said, raise your hand and let us know.

360
00:17:28,418 --> 00:17:31,400
Because we don't want any card text to be confusing enough

361
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:33,341
that you'd have to read it twice to understand it.

362
00:17:34,882 --> 00:17:35,742
So this was our goal.

363
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:38,284
Low complexity, high depth,

364
00:17:38,864 --> 00:17:40,645
and the doubling cube really helped us get there.

365
00:17:41,466 --> 00:17:43,367
It's easy to understand at the ton of depth.

366
00:17:43,867 --> 00:17:46,588
However, the simple mechanic of the doubling cube

367
00:17:46,628 --> 00:17:49,350
ended up taking a ton of iterations to get just right.

368
00:17:50,491 --> 00:17:54,553
So when we played it physically with just paper and a die,

369
00:17:54,693 --> 00:17:55,453
we had no limit.

370
00:17:55,473 --> 00:17:56,754
You could double the cube as many times as you want to.

371
00:17:57,605 --> 00:18:00,947
We knew we needed to have a little more structure when we moved into a digital prototype.

372
00:18:00,967 --> 00:18:04,851
So we said, okay, you can double once a turn and we'll just throw up a dialogue box that says,

373
00:18:04,891 --> 00:18:06,632
hey, your opponent wants to double the cube.

374
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:09,314
Are you cool sticking around or do you want to concede right now?

375
00:18:10,956 --> 00:18:12,197
And it was pretty jarring because it interrupted.

376
00:18:12,217 --> 00:18:15,539
You just like have to stop playing your cards in the middle of your turn to process the dialogue box.

377
00:18:16,224 --> 00:18:18,586
So we said, okay, what if we move it to the end of the turn?

378
00:18:18,706 --> 00:18:22,648
You do all your actions and then we'll tell you what your opponent wanted to do

379
00:18:22,688 --> 00:18:25,070
and we'll compare it to what you wanted to do and we'll resolve it then.

380
00:18:25,110 --> 00:18:25,550
That helped.

381
00:18:26,051 --> 00:18:27,732
We started to experiment with some stuff like,

382
00:18:28,032 --> 00:18:32,235
could we make the betting and bluffing even more, have even more texture?

383
00:18:32,275 --> 00:18:34,756
So we added not just the ability to double the cube,

384
00:18:34,836 --> 00:18:36,918
but would you also like to mega double the cube?

385
00:18:36,938 --> 00:18:40,500
We didn't like the word octuple, it sounds kind of nerdy, so we went with mega double.

386
00:18:42,607 --> 00:18:45,209
This was pretty cool, because you could, like, get them to limp in with a double,

387
00:18:45,309 --> 00:18:48,371
or, like, you know, slam a huge bet with an 8x there.

388
00:18:48,811 --> 00:18:51,253
But there was a lot of dialogue boxes.

389
00:18:51,673 --> 00:18:54,955
And a bunch of the people on the team, like, didn't even understand, like,

390
00:18:54,975 --> 00:18:56,877
what are these numbers? Why do I care about all this?

391
00:18:56,897 --> 00:19:00,239
Like, I just want to play the card game, and you're getting in the way of all these dialogue boxes.

392
00:19:00,339 --> 00:19:03,921
So we had what I think was the biggest inspiration in this whole journey.

393
00:19:04,622 --> 00:19:12,332
Which is, what if we moved the double acceptance from an explicit, like, yes I accept the double,

394
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:14,555
to an implicit acceptance of the double?

395
00:19:14,615 --> 00:19:20,243
So, we just had the cube automatically double every turn, and we said, hey, next turn,

396
00:19:20,683 --> 00:19:21,985
the cube's going to increase in value.

397
00:19:22,165 --> 00:19:23,086
Do you want to stick around?

398
00:19:23,206 --> 00:19:25,808
And if you do, we're just going to assume you've accepted the double.

399
00:19:26,388 --> 00:19:29,971
And this was, we used the term arcady after we made this change.

400
00:19:29,991 --> 00:19:31,171
It feels so much faster.

401
00:19:31,191 --> 00:19:32,832
We got rid of all the dialogue boxes.

402
00:19:33,393 --> 00:19:33,953
We loved it.

403
00:19:34,413 --> 00:19:38,156
But players missed the ability to hit a button to really project

404
00:19:38,196 --> 00:19:39,417
their confidence, their opponent.

405
00:19:40,037 --> 00:19:44,240
So we added the ability to tap on the cube to take it from doubling next

406
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:47,362
turn to going to mega doubling, to going up to 8x next turn.

407
00:19:48,797 --> 00:19:51,079
And this caused another problem, which was,

408
00:19:51,560 --> 00:19:54,482
if you're playing most of your games for hundreds of cubes,

409
00:19:54,943 --> 00:19:57,045
but on turn one, you're only playing for one cube

410
00:19:57,085 --> 00:19:59,066
and your hand is just slightly less than average,

411
00:19:59,387 --> 00:20:00,548
you should bail out, right?

412
00:20:00,588 --> 00:20:03,010
Just like, only play the games where you have a chance

413
00:20:03,030 --> 00:20:05,172
to win hundreds of cubes by having a great hand.

414
00:20:05,212 --> 00:20:07,834
So people were conceding on turn one most of the games.

415
00:20:08,275 --> 00:20:09,896
We realized we had to bring in the range

416
00:20:09,956 --> 00:20:13,079
so that the average cube game and the starting cube game

417
00:20:13,119 --> 00:20:14,120
were much closer in.

418
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:18,261
So we got rid of all the auto-doubling and just let people snap a couple of times.

419
00:20:18,321 --> 00:20:23,042
Hopefully that would bring it down. People missed having the opportunity to bail out before the game ended.

420
00:20:23,082 --> 00:20:28,743
They really liked feeling like an excuse to leave. So we combined all of our approaches up to now.

421
00:20:29,163 --> 00:20:32,904
We added one auto-double at the end of the game, so you could bail out on turn 5 if you want to.

422
00:20:32,924 --> 00:20:37,205
We had one snap, or you could tap on the cube to double it. Eventually we added the snap back.

423
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,445
And that's where we ended up. That's how we got there. It was quite the journey.

424
00:20:41,446 --> 00:20:45,769
But why did we call Tapping on the Cube a SNAP?

425
00:20:47,330 --> 00:20:50,332
And for that matter, why is the game called Marvel SNAP?

426
00:20:51,552 --> 00:20:52,833
It's because naming is impossible.

427
00:20:52,853 --> 00:20:57,216
This is one of our many brainstorms where we tried to name the game,

428
00:20:58,236 --> 00:21:01,158
featuring such hits as Marvel Cosmic Posse,

429
00:21:01,719 --> 00:21:03,099
Marvel all caps orb.

430
00:21:05,027 --> 00:21:09,189
We briefly considered calling the game Infinity Stone, Heroes of Marvel, but we didn't do that.

431
00:21:10,670 --> 00:21:13,051
So normally I use a naming hack to name things.

432
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:19,675
So this is a frame from an XKCD comic where he talks about two-syllable words,

433
00:21:19,995 --> 00:21:23,517
where the emphasis is on the first syllable and how much fun these words are to say.

434
00:21:23,797 --> 00:21:25,858
Does anybody know what this poetic term is called?

435
00:21:28,964 --> 00:21:30,385
No, no close, you got it.

436
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:31,567
I don't know how to pronounce it.

437
00:21:31,627 --> 00:21:32,848
I asked, I don't know how to pronounce it.

438
00:21:32,868 --> 00:21:34,529
So I'm just gonna, I think it's trochee

439
00:21:34,569 --> 00:21:35,110
is what I think it is.

440
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,712
And they're just fantastic.

441
00:21:37,752 --> 00:21:40,375
Trochees are like the best word type.

442
00:21:41,195 --> 00:21:43,397
Does anybody know the name of any famous companies?

443
00:21:43,437 --> 00:21:45,099
Just yell them out, famous companies.

444
00:21:46,761 --> 00:21:48,102
Well, not all at once. I can't hear you.

445
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:50,262
I did kind of ask for that.

446
00:21:50,783 --> 00:21:51,743
I'll just show you the answer here.

447
00:21:53,184 --> 00:21:54,424
These are all trokies.

448
00:21:54,844 --> 00:21:56,885
Riot, Blizzard, Google, Facebook, Marvel,

449
00:21:56,945 --> 00:21:58,606
Netflix, Lego, Tesla, Meta,

450
00:21:58,706 --> 00:22:00,647
Intel, Apple, Call of Duty, YouTube.

451
00:22:00,967 --> 00:22:03,188
Every word up here is a trokey.

452
00:22:04,248 --> 00:22:07,330
And I also believe that what you name your game or company or whatever

453
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,590
doesn't matter at all.

454
00:22:09,851 --> 00:22:11,691
So what's the first thing you think of when I show you this word?

455
00:22:12,848 --> 00:22:14,469
Was it one of those, right?

456
00:22:14,809 --> 00:22:16,411
Some of you have won some of these.

457
00:22:18,072 --> 00:22:19,553
This one probably most of you all thought about,

458
00:22:19,573 --> 00:22:20,353
the one on the left here.

459
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:22,955
I don't know about y'all,

460
00:22:22,975 --> 00:22:25,096
but I never imagined deer constellations

461
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:26,798
or space dollars when I saw this word.

462
00:22:27,338 --> 00:22:30,820
You can literally name stuff whatever you want,

463
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:33,402
and people will fill that name in with new meaning

464
00:22:34,062 --> 00:22:35,123
whatever you tell them it is.

465
00:22:36,049 --> 00:22:40,011
In fact, your game's name doesn't even need any real words in it.

466
00:22:40,752 --> 00:22:42,193
These are all nonsense words.

467
00:22:43,734 --> 00:22:44,375
And nobody's like,

468
00:22:44,435 --> 00:22:46,776
I'm sorry, you say this game is called chess?

469
00:22:47,097 --> 00:22:47,757
What's a chess?

470
00:22:50,892 --> 00:22:52,073
So why Marvel's Snap?

471
00:22:52,153 --> 00:22:55,094
Well, for years we struggled with the narrative

472
00:22:55,134 --> 00:22:55,954
wrapper for the game.

473
00:22:56,294 --> 00:22:58,655
Hearthstone has an evocative and grounded wrapper.

474
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:02,817
It's the game that denizens of Azeroth play in a tavern.

475
00:23:03,437 --> 00:23:07,319
It's not so much a story, but a setting and a vibe.

476
00:23:08,039 --> 00:23:09,600
So what is Snap's setting?

477
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,321
Does it have a story?

478
00:23:12,361 --> 00:23:13,241
And how do we tell it?

479
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:16,783
Well, this is the thing I hate more than

480
00:23:16,923 --> 00:23:17,963
anything in video games.

481
00:23:18,722 --> 00:23:19,683
Welcome to Marvel Snap.

482
00:23:19,703 --> 00:23:22,505
The evil villain Thanos has assembled the all-power Infinity Stones.

483
00:23:22,685 --> 00:23:24,906
Here is some... I hate this so much.

484
00:23:26,287 --> 00:23:28,748
And to demonstrate the point, I've created the story tier list for you.

485
00:23:28,788 --> 00:23:31,230
So at S tier, we've got a story for the ages.

486
00:23:32,030 --> 00:23:34,092
At F tier, we've got a boring story.

487
00:23:34,412 --> 00:23:35,212
And here's the thing.

488
00:23:35,993 --> 00:23:38,494
At A tier, no story at all.

489
00:23:38,754 --> 00:23:41,996
It's just not that much worse than having a story for the ages.

490
00:23:42,036 --> 00:23:46,059
So if you are choosing between having a boring story or just cutting all the story out,

491
00:23:46,419 --> 00:23:47,760
cut the story out, please.

492
00:23:48,634 --> 00:23:52,916
And I consider vibes and setting to be really different than story.

493
00:23:52,936 --> 00:23:57,058
Some people say, when I say story, they hear plot, and I think that's accurate.

494
00:23:57,638 --> 00:24:02,500
I don't have to understand Street Fighter's story to be able to enjoy it.

495
00:24:03,081 --> 00:24:04,441
And the game isn't even trying to explain it to me.

496
00:24:04,461 --> 00:24:07,663
They just say, Blanka versus E-Honda, fight.

497
00:24:08,623 --> 00:24:10,904
And nobody asks, well, hold on, why are they fighting?

498
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,507
So this is, I wanted to think about Marvel Snap.

499
00:24:19,156 --> 00:24:21,497
But despite that, we tried to hamfist the story in anyway.

500
00:24:21,557 --> 00:24:23,659
So here's an actual presentation I gave the team here.

501
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:26,861
The Infinity Stones have been destroyed.

502
00:24:27,462 --> 00:24:30,484
Their shards spread throughout the galaxy.

503
00:24:31,285 --> 00:24:33,626
Forces have moved to collect them.

504
00:24:34,487 --> 00:24:37,289
They cannot fall into the wrong hands.

505
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,312
The stones must be reformed.

506
00:24:41,052 --> 00:24:43,114
But he can never know.

507
00:24:43,754 --> 00:24:44,595
Marvel Snap!

508
00:24:45,195 --> 00:24:45,295
So...

509
00:24:46,631 --> 00:24:49,733
The plan was not to actually tell that story in that way in the game,

510
00:24:50,053 --> 00:24:53,994
but to use it as the setting for why you'd want to get cubes,

511
00:24:54,034 --> 00:24:55,655
and we called them Infinity Stones at that time,

512
00:24:56,035 --> 00:24:57,316
and what your goal is in the game.

513
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,677
So players would collect Infinity Shards,

514
00:24:59,737 --> 00:25:00,938
and as they got more and more of them,

515
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,278
they'd assemble Infinity Stones,

516
00:25:02,298 --> 00:25:03,859
which would unlock new features in the game.

517
00:25:04,479 --> 00:25:07,120
And we ended up pivoting away from these gameplay mechanics

518
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:09,662
and the theming associated with them, as you'll see here.

519
00:25:11,662 --> 00:25:13,163
But we love the name so much.

520
00:25:14,144 --> 00:25:15,105
that we decided to keep it.

521
00:25:15,726 --> 00:25:17,107
And to tie the name back in,

522
00:25:17,147 --> 00:25:19,770
we named our most iconic gameplay mechanic after the name.

523
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:21,491
Oh, Snap!

524
00:25:21,712 --> 00:25:23,153
So, thank you.

525
00:25:23,233 --> 00:25:26,156
Naming it a Snap was a last ditch effort

526
00:25:26,596 --> 00:25:28,378
to make our name make any kind of sense

527
00:25:28,999 --> 00:25:30,100
now that we've stripped all the

528
00:25:30,140 --> 00:25:31,341
Infinity Stone stuff out of it.

529
00:25:32,257 --> 00:25:35,520
So why keep the name without the Infinity Stone theming?

530
00:25:35,860 --> 00:25:38,583
We could have changed the name to Marvel Cube or something.

531
00:25:39,063 --> 00:25:40,464
Well, we love the energy behind it.

532
00:25:40,504 --> 00:25:43,087
We love the snappiness of it.

533
00:25:43,587 --> 00:25:46,450
And games are over in a snap.

534
00:25:46,510 --> 00:25:47,691
It's a snap to learn.

535
00:25:47,991 --> 00:25:49,652
At the end of the day, I think the approachability

536
00:25:49,793 --> 00:25:52,775
and impact, inherent fun of the name makes an impact.

537
00:25:53,636 --> 00:25:55,437
Okay, so let's check in on our recipe,

538
00:25:55,598 --> 00:25:56,298
see how we're doing here.

539
00:25:57,099 --> 00:25:58,880
We've got the doubling cube from Backgammon.

540
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:03,699
and a five-minute mobile-friendly experience from Clash Royale.

541
00:26:04,579 --> 00:26:09,342
But the rest of the inspirations, once again, came from physical board and card games.

542
00:26:12,283 --> 00:26:12,843
Pause for impact.

543
00:26:14,253 --> 00:26:17,936
This is my dad, and when I was a kid, he used to give me his old business cards,

544
00:26:17,996 --> 00:26:19,818
and I would design card games on the back.

545
00:26:19,858 --> 00:26:23,141
So when I got my first job at Blizzard, I kept all my old business cards,

546
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:26,564
imagining that someday I would get to use them to make card games with.

547
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:31,067
And this is the first physical prototype that we made

548
00:26:31,248 --> 00:26:32,889
on the development process for Marvel Snap,

549
00:26:33,169 --> 00:26:34,290
on the back of my first business cards.

550
00:26:34,711 --> 00:26:36,072
So we had the doubling cube.

551
00:26:36,592 --> 00:26:38,773
We tried to keep it simple with only two numbers per card.

552
00:26:39,214 --> 00:26:40,854
We had some kind of weird leveling system.

553
00:26:41,115 --> 00:26:43,556
But the big thing that we were trying to achieve

554
00:26:43,576 --> 00:26:45,917
was simultaneous reveals.

555
00:26:46,477 --> 00:26:49,199
So this is my favorite two-player board game,

556
00:26:49,579 --> 00:26:51,620
Lord of the Rings The Confrontation by Reiner Kadesia,

557
00:26:51,660 --> 00:26:54,302
who is the most prolific board game designer ever to live.

558
00:26:54,322 --> 00:26:55,962
He's got many hundreds of games to his credit.

559
00:26:56,983 --> 00:27:01,344
It's like Stratego, but when you fight an opponent's unit, you both play a card face down,

560
00:27:01,384 --> 00:27:03,665
and you reveal your cards at the same time, and it impacts the battle.

561
00:27:04,245 --> 00:27:06,485
I love the mind games in this game. It's incredible.

562
00:27:07,226 --> 00:27:09,886
I also love this game, the Game of Thrones board game by Christian Peterson.

563
00:27:10,126 --> 00:27:13,327
It also has that same mechanic. When two armies fight, you play a card face down,

564
00:27:13,367 --> 00:27:14,327
you reveal them at the same time.

565
00:27:15,208 --> 00:27:18,288
Super fun. I found myself really drawn to this particular ingredient.

566
00:27:18,949 --> 00:27:20,409
And I wanted to experiment with it in card games.

567
00:27:21,492 --> 00:27:23,873
So, I know this prototype had simultaneous reveals,

568
00:27:24,313 --> 00:27:26,674
but otherwise I cannot remember for the life of me how to play it,

569
00:27:26,935 --> 00:27:28,575
because we only played it one time.

570
00:27:28,595 --> 00:27:31,577
And after we were done, me and Hamilton looked at each other and we said,

571
00:27:31,597 --> 00:27:32,857
yo, this game sucks.

572
00:27:34,487 --> 00:27:36,088
Which is very demoralizing.

573
00:27:36,748 --> 00:27:39,628
When you're playing cards simultaneously,

574
00:27:39,668 --> 00:27:41,349
you need some kind of context.

575
00:27:41,869 --> 00:27:43,549
What do I think they're going to play?

576
00:27:44,169 --> 00:27:46,030
And then you could play around those suspicions.

577
00:27:46,550 --> 00:27:48,390
So we did something to start on the board

578
00:27:48,791 --> 00:27:49,911
to give you that context.

579
00:27:50,171 --> 00:27:52,691
And I should have known that we needed context,

580
00:27:53,132 --> 00:27:55,192
because I used to participate in professional rock, paper,

581
00:27:55,212 --> 00:27:57,593
scissors competitions under a freeway overpass in Los

582
00:27:57,653 --> 00:27:57,993
Angeles.

583
00:27:58,673 --> 00:28:01,393
So rock, paper, scissors is totally random, right?

584
00:28:02,142 --> 00:28:04,003
It's pretty boring, there's very little strategy

585
00:28:04,043 --> 00:28:04,784
in Rock, Paper, Scissors.

586
00:28:06,165 --> 00:28:07,345
The thing is, in these tournaments,

587
00:28:08,166 --> 00:28:11,448
you get one minute of taunting before the match begins.

588
00:28:12,209 --> 00:28:14,850
So most people come in character like the barber

589
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:17,712
or Sergeant Scissors, but sometimes people just use

590
00:28:17,732 --> 00:28:20,134
the whole minute and go paper, paper, paper, paper,

591
00:28:20,174 --> 00:28:21,494
paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper,

592
00:28:21,534 --> 00:28:23,356
paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper, paper.

593
00:28:24,056 --> 00:28:27,338
And hilariously, that adds some context, right?

594
00:28:27,578 --> 00:28:28,599
Are they telling the truth?

595
00:28:29,439 --> 00:28:31,521
Or are they trying to double bluff me?

596
00:28:33,894 --> 00:28:38,200
So this game, Smash Up by Paul Peterson, doesn't have simultaneous reveals,

597
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,744
but you can play your cards to locations, and the locations have special abilities

598
00:28:42,105 --> 00:28:43,387
that make each game a little different.

599
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:46,691
And I thought this could be a really cool way to give the game we were working on

600
00:28:46,711 --> 00:28:48,814
some context for simultaneous reveals.

601
00:28:49,722 --> 00:28:50,182
And they did.

602
00:28:50,482 --> 00:28:52,443
So Mojo World, for example, is a location

603
00:28:52,463 --> 00:28:53,684
that gives you plus 100 power if you have

604
00:28:53,704 --> 00:28:54,584
more cards than your opponent.

605
00:28:55,164 --> 00:28:57,885
OK, I bet they're going to play their cards to Mojo World.

606
00:28:58,465 --> 00:29:00,966
Or maybe I'll let them overcommit there,

607
00:29:01,006 --> 00:29:02,667
and I'll try and take the other two locations.

608
00:29:03,027 --> 00:29:05,067
And this core decision making was simple,

609
00:29:05,568 --> 00:29:06,248
but immediately fun.

610
00:29:07,168 --> 00:29:09,649
In our earliest prototypes, all the locations started revealed,

611
00:29:09,689 --> 00:29:11,169
but we felt like that was a lot of information

612
00:29:11,570 --> 00:29:12,830
to absorb right at the beginning of the game.

613
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:17,231
So we made them reveal on turn one, turn two, and turn three

614
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:17,532
instead.

615
00:29:19,071 --> 00:29:22,679
So they give us the context we needed, but I think more importantly,

616
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,605
they increased the variance of our core gameplay.

617
00:29:26,752 --> 00:29:28,653
So I said George Fan has the best GDC talk,

618
00:29:28,693 --> 00:29:31,275
but this talk by Richard Garfield,

619
00:29:31,335 --> 00:29:32,395
titled Luck in Games,

620
00:29:32,915 --> 00:29:35,317
is my all-time favorite design talk of any kind.

621
00:29:36,077 --> 00:29:38,619
So I think most people misunderstand

622
00:29:38,699 --> 00:29:40,540
the relationship between luck and skill.

623
00:29:41,240 --> 00:29:42,801
A lot of people imagine it as a scale,

624
00:29:42,961 --> 00:29:45,962
where you got luck on one side and skill on the other,

625
00:29:46,182 --> 00:29:48,564
and games are somewhere along this scale.

626
00:29:48,584 --> 00:29:51,865
And we use the terms luck-based and skill-based

627
00:29:52,186 --> 00:29:54,347
to talk about where games land on this scale.

628
00:29:54,847 --> 00:29:55,828
But that's not how it works at all.

629
00:29:56,428 --> 00:29:59,150
So you can have games that are low skill and high luck,

630
00:29:59,210 --> 00:30:01,952
like chutes and ladders, or high skill and low luck, like chess.

631
00:30:02,213 --> 00:30:05,135
But you can also have games, like my favorite game to make fun of,

632
00:30:05,155 --> 00:30:07,877
tic-tac-toe, which is low skill and low luck.

633
00:30:08,398 --> 00:30:11,440
And you can have games that are high luck and high skill, like poker.

634
00:30:13,222 --> 00:30:14,563
Like, there's a ton of randomness in poker,

635
00:30:14,583 --> 00:30:16,605
but the best players are winning again and again.

636
00:30:17,712 --> 00:30:21,653
Games in the high luck, high skill category, I think, are super fun

637
00:30:22,013 --> 00:30:24,354
because they include a ton of interesting decisions,

638
00:30:24,954 --> 00:30:28,316
but they also have exciting moments and are different every time you play them.

639
00:30:29,356 --> 00:30:31,497
So, all card games have some amount of randomness,

640
00:30:31,517 --> 00:30:33,598
because you shuffle a deck of cards and draw from a random deck.

641
00:30:34,058 --> 00:30:36,839
But Hearthstone, I think, has less variance at its core

642
00:30:36,859 --> 00:30:38,380
than other card games for a couple of reasons.

643
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:41,021
One, the mana system isn't random.

644
00:30:41,041 --> 00:30:42,701
You just get one every single turn of the game.

645
00:30:44,164 --> 00:30:46,166
Smaller decks decrease the variance some amount.

646
00:30:46,726 --> 00:30:51,068
And because you aren't drawing resources, you're just drawing more usable cards every turn.

647
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:52,849
So you effectively have a higher rate of card draw.

648
00:30:52,870 --> 00:30:56,572
And those all reduce the variance of Hearthstone's core gameplay rules.

649
00:30:57,292 --> 00:30:59,273
But the thing is, we wanted Hearthstone to have more variance.

650
00:31:00,645 --> 00:31:03,785
So we added a bunch of variants to the cards.

651
00:31:03,805 --> 00:31:05,506
Arcane Missiles deals damage randomly.

652
00:31:05,786 --> 00:31:07,326
Lightning Storm deals a range of damage.

653
00:31:07,406 --> 00:31:08,926
Animal Companion summons a random beast.

654
00:31:09,807 --> 00:31:13,687
And this was successful at making Hearthstone more random,

655
00:31:14,508 --> 00:31:16,548
but players didn't love it.

656
00:31:17,028 --> 00:31:19,629
We got a lot of feedback that Hearthstone felt too random.

657
00:31:20,029 --> 00:31:21,829
I think part of it is that the randomness here

658
00:31:21,849 --> 00:31:22,809
is very overt, right?

659
00:31:22,829 --> 00:31:24,730
We had to put the word random on a lot of cards.

660
00:31:25,970 --> 00:31:28,690
But also, there's two different kinds of randomness.

661
00:31:30,004 --> 00:31:32,726
So input randomness is where there's a random event,

662
00:31:33,486 --> 00:31:34,887
and then, like drawing a card,

663
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:37,328
and then you get to, you have to make a strategic decision

664
00:31:37,428 --> 00:31:38,749
in the face of that random event.

665
00:31:38,789 --> 00:31:40,650
For example, the hub, it's a random card

666
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:41,330
in each player's hand,

667
00:31:41,890 --> 00:31:43,111
and then you and your opponent have to figure out

668
00:31:43,151 --> 00:31:44,992
how to use that card to your best advantage

669
00:31:45,152 --> 00:31:46,593
after you've seen the random event.

670
00:31:47,588 --> 00:31:48,629
So input randomness is awesome.

671
00:31:49,130 --> 00:31:51,292
It puts you in new situations you've never been in before.

672
00:31:51,552 --> 00:31:54,175
You have to think on your feet and solve problems on the fly.

673
00:31:54,195 --> 00:31:56,578
In games without a lot of input randomness,

674
00:31:56,818 --> 00:31:57,939
there's like a right answer, right?

675
00:31:58,019 --> 00:31:59,921
Like in chess, players have to,

676
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:01,743
you know, they're really high levels.

677
00:32:02,264 --> 00:32:04,766
It's not like, okay, what piece do I move on turn one?

678
00:32:04,826 --> 00:32:05,847
You've got like an opening move.

679
00:32:05,867 --> 00:32:07,930
People memorize series of opening moves

680
00:32:08,310 --> 00:32:10,112
until you get to the fun part of chess later on.

681
00:32:12,355 --> 00:32:15,196
Because the random event happens and then you get to respond to it,

682
00:32:15,216 --> 00:32:18,038
you feel like you have a lot of control over the randomness in the game.

683
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:20,919
And output randomness is the opposite.

684
00:32:20,939 --> 00:32:23,160
So output randomness is where you make a decision

685
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,821
and then you find out if it was the right decision or the wrong decision.

686
00:32:25,841 --> 00:32:29,543
For example, Danger Room, you have a 25% chance every time you play a card there

687
00:32:29,683 --> 00:32:30,423
for it to be destroyed.

688
00:32:30,683 --> 00:32:33,205
You have to decide to play a card there and then you're going to find out

689
00:32:33,225 --> 00:32:34,465
if it's the right decision or the wrong decision.

690
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,331
Ragnaros deals 8 damage to a random enemy.

691
00:32:38,391 --> 00:32:39,891
Maybe it's enemy hero and you win.

692
00:32:40,312 --> 00:32:43,013
Maybe it's, you know, the exact minion you didn't want to hit and you lose.

693
00:32:43,493 --> 00:32:45,034
But you have to choose to play Ragnaros first.

694
00:32:46,455 --> 00:32:48,516
So Output Randomness is exciting.

695
00:32:49,036 --> 00:32:53,178
It's what, like, streamers, like, the viewers on Twitch love to see.

696
00:32:53,618 --> 00:32:55,139
It's great stories.

697
00:32:56,894 --> 00:33:03,662
This is, I think, the most exciting, the best question we can ask players in games, which is,

698
00:33:03,822 --> 00:33:04,943
is it worth the risk?

699
00:33:05,564 --> 00:33:08,567
And as a player deciding, okay, I think I'm going to lose this game.

700
00:33:08,607 --> 00:33:09,809
I need to start taking some risks.

701
00:33:09,869 --> 00:33:13,052
I'm going to start playing cards of the danger room and hope I don't get that 25%.

702
00:33:13,112 --> 00:33:17,497
I think that's a really interesting depth, and that's the kind of depth you get from output randomness.

703
00:33:19,234 --> 00:33:22,915
Seeing that a random event is coming and controlling the odds, for example,

704
00:33:22,935 --> 00:33:26,036
destroying all the other minions, Ragnaros is definitely going to hit the ones you want,

705
00:33:26,677 --> 00:33:28,938
is also some fun depth that comes from output randomness.

706
00:33:29,458 --> 00:33:30,358
And this is interesting.

707
00:33:30,678 --> 00:33:34,060
If you have output randomness, players will say that they lost to the randomness,

708
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:35,360
which has pros and cons.

709
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:38,121
The cons are that it feels like you don't have very much agency,

710
00:33:38,181 --> 00:33:40,102
and you just kind of lost randomly, and your skill doesn't matter.

711
00:33:40,442 --> 00:33:44,704
But the pro is that as people, we are unable to grapple with our own ineptitude,

712
00:33:45,204 --> 00:33:47,345
and this provides an outlet for your ego.

713
00:33:48,862 --> 00:33:53,245
So locations, I think interestingly, are both input randomness and output randomness.

714
00:33:53,265 --> 00:33:55,527
And you get to choose which of those you want more of.

715
00:33:55,587 --> 00:33:59,770
So if you play to a revealed location, that's input randomness.

716
00:33:59,790 --> 00:34:03,672
You got to see what the location was going to be, and then you decide to play a card there or not.

717
00:34:04,093 --> 00:34:07,275
And if you play to an unrevealed location, that's output randomness, right?

718
00:34:07,315 --> 00:34:11,077
You play a card to an unrevealed location, and then surprise! It's murder world!

719
00:34:11,097 --> 00:34:11,898
Your cards are dead!

720
00:34:13,019 --> 00:34:13,499
Mistake!

721
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,544
So we've talked about a couple of the impacts of locations, the randomness, the ad, simultaneous reveals.

722
00:34:21,425 --> 00:34:24,688
But they also have a couple other interesting effects.

723
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:28,692
So in a collectible card game, over time the meta gets stale.

724
00:34:28,712 --> 00:34:32,776
This is why people, other card games, release thousands of new cards a year, hundreds of new cards a year.

725
00:34:32,796 --> 00:34:34,637
It's to keep the meta fresh.

726
00:34:34,657 --> 00:34:38,941
It's because eventually you run out of new problems to solve, right?

727
00:34:38,981 --> 00:34:40,663
I've seen this deck before, I know what it's trying to do.

728
00:34:41,424 --> 00:34:45,726
Locations give you every single game something new, something exciting that's going to happen,

729
00:34:45,786 --> 00:34:48,768
so it reduces the effect of a stale meta some amount.

730
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,670
And by the same token, it lowers the impact of imbalance, right?

731
00:34:51,710 --> 00:34:53,552
Everyone's playing the same deck as one deck is broken,

732
00:34:54,052 --> 00:34:58,075
and at least the locations are giving you new problems to solve, even if enemy players are not.

733
00:34:58,175 --> 00:35:00,736
Balance is still important, but it lowers the impact some amount.

734
00:35:01,613 --> 00:35:04,696
And then it makes LiveOps, I mean, there's still a lot of work to do for LiveOps,

735
00:35:04,716 --> 00:35:06,558
but it adds a cool lever for us, right?

736
00:35:06,598 --> 00:35:11,762
We can add new locations or change the locations to create LiveOps pretty easily.

737
00:35:11,802 --> 00:35:15,105
For example, we have this thing called Hot Location, where one day a week,

738
00:35:15,686 --> 00:35:17,487
this location shows up in 50% of all games.

739
00:35:17,547 --> 00:35:20,690
It causes players to change their decks to take advantage of the location.

740
00:35:20,710 --> 00:35:23,453
It adds some fun LiveOps flavor to the game.

741
00:35:24,634 --> 00:35:26,615
Unless we make the Hot Location...

742
00:35:28,197 --> 00:35:31,623
Make the current best deck even better, and then it reduces the...

743
00:35:31,884 --> 00:35:34,929
increases the staleness of the genre, like we did when Mr. Negative was the best deck.

744
00:35:35,470 --> 00:35:37,654
And we made the peak the featured location. Huge mistake.

745
00:35:39,719 --> 00:35:42,040
So we had a hundred locations going in the launch,

746
00:35:42,860 --> 00:35:43,901
and late in the game we decided,

747
00:35:43,941 --> 00:35:46,722
hey, wait a second, what if we cut 60 locations

748
00:35:47,402 --> 00:35:49,003
and instead launch with 40 locations,

749
00:35:49,043 --> 00:35:50,664
and then we can launch one new location

750
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:51,884
every single week for a year.

751
00:35:52,464 --> 00:35:54,605
And 40 was not the right number,

752
00:35:55,006 --> 00:35:56,606
but we did cut most of the locations

753
00:35:56,806 --> 00:35:58,387
and have been releasing one every week for a year,

754
00:35:58,407 --> 00:36:00,788
and it was a great way to kind of front load our launch

755
00:36:01,188 --> 00:36:02,409
with tons of LiveOps content.

756
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,119
Okay, so we had the doubling cube, we had simultaneous reveals,

757
00:36:07,559 --> 00:36:10,020
we had locations, we started having a ton of fun.

758
00:36:10,621 --> 00:36:12,542
And all in all, this prototype,

759
00:36:13,862 --> 00:36:16,143
starting from that first prototype, this one, took about two days,

760
00:36:16,964 --> 00:36:19,905
which is not very normal, and we doubted ourselves a lot.

761
00:36:19,985 --> 00:36:23,007
We took a break from this and started trying to design some other games

762
00:36:23,027 --> 00:36:24,027
because we weren't sure this was it.

763
00:36:24,047 --> 00:36:26,509
But we just kept wanting to come back and play this one.

764
00:36:27,349 --> 00:36:30,371
We eventually printed out the prototype instead of writing it on some cards

765
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:32,352
because we were fighting over the only copy of Galactus.

766
00:36:34,395 --> 00:36:38,139
And we used this prototype years later to prototype 2v2.

767
00:36:38,319 --> 00:36:41,381
So 2v2 is just five locations, and your team

768
00:36:41,401 --> 00:36:43,663
has to win three out of five of the locations.

769
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:46,966
It was really fun.

770
00:36:47,006 --> 00:36:48,167
We wouldn't have been able to do it easily

771
00:36:48,207 --> 00:36:50,249
without the physical prototype, I think,

772
00:36:50,589 --> 00:36:51,730
because it's hard to prototype digitally.

773
00:36:51,970 --> 00:36:53,311
Now, I'm not saying we're ever going to do 2v2.

774
00:36:53,392 --> 00:36:54,553
It's just something we were experimenting with,

775
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:55,734
but it was fun to try.

776
00:36:57,298 --> 00:36:59,519
Okay, so here's the full recipe for Marvel Snap.

777
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:00,860
We have the double link give for backgammon,

778
00:37:00,901 --> 00:37:02,382
simultaneous reveals and mind games

779
00:37:02,482 --> 00:37:03,783
from Lord of the Rings and Game of Thrones,

780
00:37:04,483 --> 00:37:06,024
locations with abilities from Smash Up,

781
00:37:07,385 --> 00:37:08,606
five-minute games from Clash Royale,

782
00:37:08,946 --> 00:37:12,069
and a few, I think, really impactful innovations,

783
00:37:12,549 --> 00:37:15,111
six-turn games, 12-card decks,

784
00:37:15,911 --> 00:37:18,033
and I think for the first time, maybe,

785
00:37:18,213 --> 00:37:20,074
in a collectible card game, only one card type,

786
00:37:20,094 --> 00:37:21,656
which means there's like no card types, right?

787
00:37:21,696 --> 00:37:22,576
It's not even a thing.

788
00:37:24,447 --> 00:37:30,912
So these innovations were impactful, but it's not clear to me that your game needs any innovations

789
00:37:31,433 --> 00:37:33,775
to feel fresh and exciting and unique.

790
00:37:34,075 --> 00:37:38,159
For example, I think if you asked players of Marvel Snap, what are the top three fresh

791
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:42,083
things in Marvel Snap, I think none of the innovations would be on that list.

792
00:37:43,664 --> 00:37:48,368
So with the basic core gameplay figured out, it was time to move to our digital prototype.

793
00:37:49,432 --> 00:37:50,613
And here's the first digital prototype.

794
00:37:50,833 --> 00:37:52,193
We were prioritizing moving fast,

795
00:37:52,273 --> 00:37:53,974
so I think this took about two weeks to make.

796
00:37:53,994 --> 00:37:56,255
I don't know how to do any networking stuff,

797
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,755
so it was a hot seat prototype

798
00:37:57,775 --> 00:37:59,696
where both people play on the same screen.

799
00:38:00,116 --> 00:38:01,256
We played a bunch on the iPad.

800
00:38:01,637 --> 00:38:03,537
This is a big iPad, but it looks bigger.

801
00:38:03,557 --> 00:38:05,158
That's my son's four-year-old hand there,

802
00:38:05,178 --> 00:38:06,298
so the scale's off.

803
00:38:07,627 --> 00:38:11,069
So we tried to make this stuff super easy to change so we could essentially

804
00:38:11,670 --> 00:38:15,653
figure out all of the—the right number for all of the levers in the game by brute force.

805
00:38:15,693 --> 00:38:18,816
So we tried six-turn games, five-turn games.

806
00:38:18,836 --> 00:38:21,378
We tried skipping turn one, doing turns two through six.

807
00:38:21,698 --> 00:38:24,300
We tried three, four, five cards in the starting hand.

808
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:28,904
We tried nine cards per location, six cards, three cards, four cards per location.

809
00:38:28,944 --> 00:38:29,384
We tried it all.

810
00:38:30,864 --> 00:38:35,771
So everything up to this point was done while the studio was just two people, me and Hamilton.

811
00:38:35,912 --> 00:38:36,793
Not that we had all that much stuff.

812
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:38,776
We'd scribbled on some cards and spent a couple weeks on a prototype.

813
00:38:39,577 --> 00:38:45,467
But I think having the smallest team possible really allows for a dramatic pivot.

814
00:38:47,106 --> 00:38:52,028
Because you spend less time explaining the vision and getting buy-in from a large team.

815
00:38:52,068 --> 00:38:55,010
So in my first year on Hearthstone, the team was about 10 people.

816
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:59,371
And Blizzard came in to a meeting one day and said, hey, we're going to take all of

817
00:38:59,411 --> 00:39:02,313
the engineers and we're going to move them on to help ship StarCraft II.

818
00:39:02,333 --> 00:39:04,834
We're going to leave about three people left on the team.

819
00:39:05,274 --> 00:39:06,595
And we were pretty sure the game was canceled.

820
00:39:06,615 --> 00:39:08,255
We just thought, oh, that's got to be it.

821
00:39:08,315 --> 00:39:08,996
They're never coming back.

822
00:39:10,156 --> 00:39:14,717
The people left on the team were Ben Thompson, the art director, and Eric Dodds and I.

823
00:39:15,337 --> 00:39:16,798
And Eric Dodds was the first lead designer.

824
00:39:18,138 --> 00:39:21,839
At the time this happened, there was a ton of momentum in another direction.

825
00:39:21,879 --> 00:39:24,759
We were working really hard on basically some other project.

826
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:30,501
And when this happened, it allowed us to be really flexible and experiment quickly and try crazy stuff.

827
00:39:31,326 --> 00:39:33,008
And the rest of the team wasn't totally gone.

828
00:39:33,048 --> 00:39:35,191
They were around for play tests and some conversations and stuff.

829
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:38,296
But essentially, at the end of the year where those team members came back,

830
00:39:38,336 --> 00:39:43,364
we had the totality of Hearthstone's core gameplay figured out and prototyped.

831
00:39:44,801 --> 00:39:49,385
Once a team gets really big, turning the ship becomes way harder.

832
00:39:49,845 --> 00:39:52,747
So late in the game on Marvel Snap, we had a really big pivot,

833
00:39:52,767 --> 00:39:56,130
where we changed all of the theming and got rid of some currencies.

834
00:39:57,050 --> 00:40:00,072
And the team, up until this point, had been giving feedback that they were worried

835
00:40:00,092 --> 00:40:02,875
that we hadn't really locked down some of our metaprogression stuff just yet.

836
00:40:02,895 --> 00:40:03,875
There was a lot of change.

837
00:40:04,456 --> 00:40:05,777
And so I knew that this...

838
00:40:06,517 --> 00:40:08,438
Pitch to change stuff was not gonna be,

839
00:40:08,458 --> 00:40:10,078
it was not gonna go down easy necessarily.

840
00:40:10,118 --> 00:40:12,359
And so I met with everyone on the team individually

841
00:40:12,659 --> 00:40:13,739
to walk them through the pitch,

842
00:40:13,799 --> 00:40:15,079
give the opportunity to ask questions,

843
00:40:15,139 --> 00:40:16,059
make sure that they felt heard.

844
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:19,880
And it takes weeks to manage this kind of change management.

845
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,141
And even the idea of having to do this

846
00:40:24,221 --> 00:40:25,541
adds a huge amount of friction

847
00:40:25,902 --> 00:40:27,802
to deciding to make a pivot.

848
00:40:28,102 --> 00:40:29,822
I think the worst thing you can do early on

849
00:40:29,862 --> 00:40:31,403
is not pivot when you should

850
00:40:31,843 --> 00:40:33,203
because you missed the opportunity

851
00:40:33,223 --> 00:40:34,323
to maybe do something great.

852
00:40:36,025 --> 00:40:37,847
So eventually we did end up adding some more folks,

853
00:40:38,487 --> 00:40:40,769
and here's our first two-device build

854
00:40:40,789 --> 00:40:42,991
that our chief production officer, Young Woo, got working.

855
00:40:43,331 --> 00:40:46,153
Apparently he was a secret backend server engineer,

856
00:40:46,193 --> 00:40:47,674
which was a delightful surprise.

857
00:40:48,575 --> 00:40:50,916
You can see we started with nine cards per location here.

858
00:40:50,976 --> 00:40:52,958
We were experimenting with five turns.

859
00:40:53,438 --> 00:40:54,339
We tried some wild stuff,

860
00:40:54,359 --> 00:40:56,340
like a left-first-right approach to locations

861
00:40:56,441 --> 00:40:59,123
to see if we could get that face-off battle feeling going.

862
00:41:00,177 --> 00:41:02,778
Our art director, Jamaro Kindred, began to pretty up the game a bit,

863
00:41:03,399 --> 00:41:05,820
and we felt like we were cruising forward on our prototype,

864
00:41:06,561 --> 00:41:07,521
but we ran into a snag.

865
00:41:08,622 --> 00:41:11,884
I think every other card game has had cards that say stuff like,

866
00:41:11,964 --> 00:41:14,226
destroy target creature, things like that.

867
00:41:14,766 --> 00:41:15,867
We had a bunch of cards like that.

868
00:41:16,748 --> 00:41:18,508
And on Hearthstone, I think we had a great UI for this.

869
00:41:18,528 --> 00:41:21,629
You drag a card out, an arrow attaches to your cursor,

870
00:41:21,869 --> 00:41:23,030
and wherever you move your cursor,

871
00:41:23,050 --> 00:41:24,970
the arrow, so you know you're in targeting mode

872
00:41:25,010 --> 00:41:26,511
when you drag a card out that requires a target.

873
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,811
And to cancel the battle cry, you tap on the card

874
00:41:28,872 --> 00:41:29,972
or just tap on any card in your hand.

875
00:41:30,632 --> 00:41:32,753
But on mobile, once you drag a card out,

876
00:41:32,793 --> 00:41:34,653
we have nothing to attach a cursor to.

877
00:41:35,033 --> 00:41:37,314
So you just don't know that you're in targeting mode.

878
00:41:37,334 --> 00:41:38,975
People kept tapping back on their hand

879
00:41:38,995 --> 00:41:40,715
to play another card and canceling the battle cry.

880
00:41:40,735 --> 00:41:41,815
It didn't work very well.

881
00:41:41,835 --> 00:41:43,116
It was fundamentally broken on mobile.

882
00:41:43,822 --> 00:41:45,362
So we had to build a whole new UI.

883
00:41:45,702 --> 00:41:47,903
The screen darkens and desaturates

884
00:41:47,923 --> 00:41:49,043
to let you know you're in a new mode.

885
00:41:49,383 --> 00:41:50,964
The potential targets are lit up in color.

886
00:41:50,984 --> 00:41:52,144
They float above the board.

887
00:41:52,644 --> 00:41:54,045
And you could tap on the target you want.

888
00:41:54,965 --> 00:41:58,106
So I think this flow is just much worse than the PC flow.

889
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,026
But it's not like we could just remove targeting

890
00:42:00,066 --> 00:42:01,287
for the mobile version of Hearthstone.

891
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,208
So when we started the run of these issues in Snap,

892
00:42:04,548 --> 00:42:05,748
we said, hey, what if we just get rid

893
00:42:05,768 --> 00:42:06,468
of targeting altogether?

894
00:42:07,626 --> 00:42:10,928
In reality, every Marvel Snap card requires a target.

895
00:42:10,948 --> 00:42:13,850
You have to target the left, middle, or right location.

896
00:42:13,890 --> 00:42:15,971
So essentially, we're asking players to choose two targets

897
00:42:16,472 --> 00:42:17,432
when cards require a target.

898
00:42:18,193 --> 00:42:21,275
And we realized that we could imply the second target

899
00:42:21,715 --> 00:42:22,936
from the first target.

900
00:42:23,896 --> 00:42:24,497
So here's Electra.

901
00:42:24,517 --> 00:42:26,338
She used to target any one-cost card.

902
00:42:26,818 --> 00:42:29,340
We changed her to target a random one-cost card

903
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:29,940
at her location.

904
00:42:29,960 --> 00:42:30,820
The UI is much simpler.

905
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:33,522
And usually, there's only one one-cost card

906
00:42:33,542 --> 00:42:34,243
at her location anyway.

907
00:42:35,137 --> 00:42:38,978
Another way to remove targeting is by implying a target through card ordering.

908
00:42:39,298 --> 00:42:42,939
So here Mystique used to be able to choose a target to pick up a copy of,

909
00:42:42,979 --> 00:42:48,321
but in her next iteration, her target is implied by playing her after you play the card you want to copy.

910
00:42:49,221 --> 00:42:52,082
We didn't have that many cards that had required targets. It was like 10 or something.

911
00:42:52,522 --> 00:42:55,262
But we changed them all and the game felt much better.

912
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:58,463
And with that solved, we continued to make progress in the game,

913
00:42:58,483 --> 00:43:02,024
and the prototype morphed slowly into a real build.

914
00:43:06,061 --> 00:43:07,364
And eventually, I think it looks great.

915
00:43:08,547 --> 00:43:08,888
OK.

916
00:43:09,449 --> 00:43:11,233
So earlier in the talk, I bragged

917
00:43:11,273 --> 00:43:13,799
about how it took us two days to design the core

918
00:43:13,839 --> 00:43:14,881
gameplay for Marvel Snap.

919
00:43:15,588 --> 00:43:19,691
But as it turned out, we would be paid back for that good fortune

920
00:43:20,072 --> 00:43:24,255
with four years of struggle trying to come up with a core loop

921
00:43:24,415 --> 00:43:26,697
and a satisfying progression model for the game.

922
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:30,721
So here's a diagram of our core loop.

923
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:31,501
Don't read this, please.

924
00:43:32,302 --> 00:43:34,684
This is one of the many iterations we were working through.

925
00:43:34,704 --> 00:43:36,105
It was madness.

926
00:43:36,145 --> 00:43:40,088
We had leagues where you'd have to do better to get up to the next league,

927
00:43:40,109 --> 00:43:42,270
and that's where certain cards were league restricted.

928
00:43:43,691 --> 00:43:48,014
We built a hero collector that worked like World of Warcraft garrisons,

929
00:43:48,034 --> 00:43:51,496
where you'd send heroes off on missions to bring back cards for you.

930
00:43:52,437 --> 00:43:54,758
This is a sphere grid with every card in the game on it,

931
00:43:54,798 --> 00:43:57,220
and you'd have to decide which cards you want to make progress towards.

932
00:43:58,561 --> 00:44:01,042
So the big lesson we learned from all that was we needed to simplify.

933
00:44:02,023 --> 00:44:03,884
So we went from this to this.

934
00:44:04,792 --> 00:44:06,833
We cut a ton of stuff, and we saw this and we were like,

935
00:44:06,953 --> 00:44:09,553
yes, we did it, we got there.

936
00:44:09,973 --> 00:44:11,534
And we went into our next testing phase,

937
00:44:11,914 --> 00:44:13,954
and unfortunately it was still wildly overcomplicated.

938
00:44:13,994 --> 00:44:16,795
We had these leagues, but we paced it over the problems

939
00:44:16,815 --> 00:44:18,535
we were having with these bizarre theming changes

940
00:44:18,555 --> 00:44:20,816
with infinity stones, we had a buy-in,

941
00:44:20,836 --> 00:44:22,916
you gotta choose the stakes of the game before you went in,

942
00:44:22,956 --> 00:44:25,357
we had this weekly rank.

943
00:44:25,377 --> 00:44:27,637
Here's a shop where you can just buy the cards

944
00:44:27,657 --> 00:44:29,638
you wanted directly, and they rotated every day,

945
00:44:29,918 --> 00:44:31,918
which means, after not that long,

946
00:44:31,998 --> 00:44:33,019
the only cards remaining are the cards

947
00:44:33,059 --> 00:44:34,099
you definitely don't wanna buy.

948
00:44:34,959 --> 00:44:35,740
It didn't work at all.

949
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:40,263
And so we went from this in 2020 to this.

950
00:44:40,763 --> 00:44:41,724
And this is what we shipped with.

951
00:44:43,125 --> 00:44:45,507
And I always feel pretty dumb when

952
00:44:45,587 --> 00:44:48,949
I spend so much time analyzing a design problem.

953
00:44:48,989 --> 00:44:51,791
And I'm like, aha, the answer is to add more complexity,

954
00:44:52,372 --> 00:44:55,174
only to realize that the answer was to simplify and remove

955
00:44:55,214 --> 00:44:55,674
complexity.

956
00:44:56,575 --> 00:44:58,476
But this quote from Pascal makes me feel better.

957
00:44:59,457 --> 00:45:01,459
I would have written a shorter letter,

958
00:45:01,759 --> 00:45:02,860
but I did not have the time.

959
00:45:05,293 --> 00:45:06,854
So speaking of time, I'm almost out of it,

960
00:45:06,894 --> 00:45:08,115
but I wanted to wrap this up

961
00:45:08,535 --> 00:45:10,076
by boiling it down to four takeaways.

962
00:45:10,096 --> 00:45:12,577
But before I do, I just wanted to say one last thing.

963
00:45:13,037 --> 00:45:15,238
The design of the core gameplay of Snap

964
00:45:15,899 --> 00:45:17,539
was, I think, foundationally important

965
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:18,860
to the whole experience,

966
00:45:19,260 --> 00:45:22,022
but it's only like 1% of the total amount of work

967
00:45:22,062 --> 00:45:22,982
to make the game great.

968
00:45:23,502 --> 00:45:26,624
What's much more important is all of the decisions

969
00:45:26,664 --> 00:45:28,725
we made as a team that add up

970
00:45:28,845 --> 00:45:30,266
over four years of game development.

971
00:45:30,666 --> 00:45:32,707
So we're basically a fully remote studio at this point,

972
00:45:32,727 --> 00:45:34,427
so I don't have a lot of great pictures of the whole team.

973
00:45:34,868 --> 00:45:37,769
But I wanted to say the team at second dinner is bonkers,

974
00:45:38,309 --> 00:45:39,649
and I'm super lucky to be a part of it.

975
00:45:40,730 --> 00:45:42,630
Okay, so here's my four takeaways.

976
00:45:43,491 --> 00:45:46,652
Chefs need ingredients, so stock your pantry.

977
00:45:47,732 --> 00:45:50,913
Be the speedboat until your direction is clear.

978
00:45:51,774 --> 00:45:55,075
Embrace randomness, input or output.

979
00:45:56,195 --> 00:45:59,117
And simplify, even if your team hates you.

980
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:03,021
Alright, that's all I got. Thank you so much. I appreciate it, everybody.

981
00:46:03,041 --> 00:46:13,104
**applause**

982
00:46:13,124 --> 00:46:15,344
So I believe we have time for some questions.

983
00:46:16,204 --> 00:46:16,764
Uh...

984
00:46:16,844 --> 00:46:17,285
Hello.

985
00:46:17,345 --> 00:46:18,485
Hello. Greetings.

986
00:46:18,785 --> 00:46:22,666
Oh, and if you're... you gotta fill out the... the... thing to rate this...

987
00:46:22,686 --> 00:46:23,606
Evaluations.

988
00:46:23,626 --> 00:46:24,687
Evaluations, thank you.

989
00:46:26,266 --> 00:46:28,869
I love the game, I've been playing for a couple of months now.

990
00:46:29,469 --> 00:46:31,472
Finally got Thanos, having a great time.

991
00:46:32,252 --> 00:46:38,739
I'm wondering about how much Disney has an influence or collaborate on the creative aspects

992
00:46:38,779 --> 00:46:39,200
of the game.

993
00:46:40,021 --> 00:46:44,746
Not only recently you got to buff Wolverine a little bit, and he's a key character.

994
00:46:45,527 --> 00:46:47,709
But also, I mean, I'm a big Marvel fan.

995
00:46:47,749 --> 00:46:50,592
And recently, back in the Marvel United third season,

996
00:46:51,173 --> 00:46:53,135
then I see a lot of the characters, which I usually

997
00:46:53,435 --> 00:46:55,237
don't care about, that I'm suddenly

998
00:46:55,297 --> 00:46:57,259
care about because I know them from Marvel Snap.

999
00:46:57,940 --> 00:47:01,203
Then I wonder if this is a big part of the Disney overarching

1000
00:47:01,243 --> 00:47:01,463
scheme.

1001
00:47:01,683 --> 00:47:04,926
Great. So I'll just repeat the question just in case it's not going to end up on the mic.

1002
00:47:04,946 --> 00:47:07,528
The question is, what's the collaboration with Marvel like?

1003
00:47:07,568 --> 00:47:09,450
How much are we a part of their strategy?

1004
00:47:10,451 --> 00:47:12,913
And do we collaborate on making characters powerful and stuff?

1005
00:47:13,313 --> 00:47:16,816
So Marvel is just unbelievably great to work with.

1006
00:47:16,936 --> 00:47:19,338
They're just like wild good.

1007
00:47:19,478 --> 00:47:23,942
So the team at Marvel Games, we couldn't have made this game without their help.

1008
00:47:24,142 --> 00:47:25,263
They basically let us do...

1009
00:47:26,704 --> 00:47:33,686
The first thing that we did was we submitted an image of Gambit throwing his cards.

1010
00:47:34,146 --> 00:47:37,427
We were like, hey, just so you know, the cards don't pass through that ring.

1011
00:47:37,447 --> 00:47:39,007
They come from there out or whatever.

1012
00:47:39,227 --> 00:47:44,469
I wouldn't have known that personally, but they helped make sure that anybody who sees this game

1013
00:47:44,489 --> 00:47:49,490
who's a big Marvel fan says, oh yeah, that's exactly the right color of that character or whatever.

1014
00:47:51,511 --> 00:47:52,952
You know, they know we work in a multiverse.

1015
00:47:53,092 --> 00:47:55,293
And so we're like, hey, can we do like band variants?

1016
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:58,475
Can we do like King to Conquer, but like DJ King to Conquer?

1017
00:47:58,495 --> 00:47:59,556
And they were like, yeah, sounds good.

1018
00:47:59,976 --> 00:48:00,937
But put them in outer space.

1019
00:48:00,977 --> 00:48:01,658
That'll be even cooler.

1020
00:48:01,678 --> 00:48:02,498
And we were like, all right.

1021
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:07,361
So they're not like pushing us in a direction.

1022
00:48:07,381 --> 00:48:08,582
They're much more like collaborators.

1023
00:48:08,622 --> 00:48:09,823
It really feels like we're on the same team

1024
00:48:09,843 --> 00:48:10,723
trying to make a game together.

1025
00:48:10,843 --> 00:48:11,784
So it's been great.

1026
00:48:11,804 --> 00:48:12,965
If you have the opportunity to work with Marvel,

1027
00:48:12,985 --> 00:48:13,585
I highly recommend it.

1028
00:48:14,366 --> 00:48:14,566
Yes.

1029
00:48:16,107 --> 00:48:16,387
OK.

1030
00:48:17,888 --> 00:48:18,428
When is merch?

1031
00:48:19,419 --> 00:48:21,262
Well, yeah, that's on Marvel.

1032
00:48:21,302 --> 00:48:22,604
Marvel controls all the merch.

1033
00:48:22,724 --> 00:48:25,668
So I tweet at Marvel, I guess.

1034
00:48:25,808 --> 00:48:28,312
So the real question would be, how much time

1035
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:30,995
was there between when you started brainstorming this

1036
00:48:31,436 --> 00:48:34,941
to talking to Marvel, like having something to show them,

1037
00:48:35,121 --> 00:48:36,443
and then actually getting contract?

1038
00:48:37,757 --> 00:48:44,099
So we, the guy who runs Marvel Games, Jay Ong, used to work with me and Hamilton a long ago.

1039
00:48:44,440 --> 00:48:50,181
So we had a relationship that was existing, which is partly how a brand new studio gets to work with Marvel.

1040
00:48:50,461 --> 00:48:51,182
It's kind of ridiculous.

1041
00:48:52,282 --> 00:48:57,024
But he knew that we had made great stuff in the past together, and he wanted to work with us again.

1042
00:48:57,384 --> 00:49:00,965
So we had the suspicion that we might get to work with Marvel, but...

1043
00:49:02,645 --> 00:49:05,086
It was probably on the order of months

1044
00:49:05,146 --> 00:49:06,427
before we showed them anything.

1045
00:49:06,927 --> 00:49:10,008
And I don't know how long the contract took,

1046
00:49:10,028 --> 00:49:12,268
but we were friends, so it kind of.

1047
00:49:12,609 --> 00:49:13,289
Thank you so much.

1048
00:49:13,669 --> 00:49:15,830
Appreciate it.

1049
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:17,750
Sorry, you've got lines on the other side.

1050
00:49:17,770 --> 00:49:19,011
Oh, my bad.

1051
00:49:19,131 --> 00:49:19,851
Oh my goodness.

1052
00:49:19,871 --> 00:49:20,211
Sorry.

1053
00:49:21,191 --> 00:49:21,531
Go ahead.

1054
00:49:21,712 --> 00:49:22,172
I'm here too.

1055
00:49:22,252 --> 00:49:22,632
Okay, hi.

1056
00:49:23,192 --> 00:49:26,113
I was wondering, variants that spawn other cards,

1057
00:49:26,193 --> 00:49:27,173
like don't show that variant.

1058
00:49:27,193 --> 00:49:28,654
Like if I play a baby Dr. Doom,

1059
00:49:28,794 --> 00:49:30,014
I don't get baby Doom bots.

1060
00:49:30,174 --> 00:49:30,514
Why?

1061
00:49:33,621 --> 00:49:34,561
It's a great question.

1062
00:49:34,581 --> 00:49:36,682
Sorry, you don't get like,

1063
00:49:37,642 --> 00:49:38,723
the cards that spawn other cards,

1064
00:49:38,783 --> 00:49:41,263
the cards that they spawn are not variants of the...

1065
00:49:41,283 --> 00:49:45,345
Yeah, I mean it was something that we would like to do

1066
00:49:45,705 --> 00:49:46,905
at some point, I think it would be great.

1067
00:49:47,105 --> 00:49:48,906
We also want to do variants for cards

1068
00:49:48,926 --> 00:49:50,806
that are spawned by locations, like rock variants.

1069
00:49:51,266 --> 00:49:52,507
By the way, Dwayne The Rock Johnson,

1070
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:53,847
if you're watching this, please hit us up.

1071
00:49:53,867 --> 00:49:55,808
We'd love to do a rock variant together.

1072
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:57,668
Thank you.

1073
00:49:58,008 --> 00:49:58,669
We'd love to do it, thanks.

1074
00:49:59,289 --> 00:49:59,649
Okay, over there.

1075
00:50:00,401 --> 00:50:05,425
So you discussed complexity versus depth and how a card that says just deal two damage

1076
00:50:05,845 --> 00:50:08,707
still can have a lot of depth and hit the depth limit that you need.

1077
00:50:09,328 --> 00:50:13,331
But eventually you've printed deal two damage and you have to start like, you know,

1078
00:50:13,391 --> 00:50:15,192
complexity creep and so forth and so on.

1079
00:50:15,473 --> 00:50:19,636
And I was wondering what your strategies are for, you know, six, ten years into the game

1080
00:50:19,656 --> 00:50:23,879
and when all the simple cards are printed, there are no more simple cards left, what to do?

1081
00:50:24,159 --> 00:50:26,601
Yeah, so the question is, yeah, you mine out the simple rules,

1082
00:50:26,621 --> 00:50:29,583
and then eventually you end up with only non-simple stuff.

1083
00:50:29,603 --> 00:50:29,923
What do you do?

1084
00:50:30,163 --> 00:50:31,444
I had a whole section of this talk called

1085
00:50:31,884 --> 00:50:37,128
The Primal Fear of Working on a Game with a Small Amount of Design Space.

1086
00:50:37,528 --> 00:50:38,309
It's horrifying.

1087
00:50:38,609 --> 00:50:40,730
So, both on Hearthstone and on Marvel Snap,

1088
00:50:40,850 --> 00:50:42,291
we—I got a point where we're like,

1089
00:50:42,952 --> 00:50:45,853
You know, we were looking at games like Magic the Gathering around 30 years later,

1090
00:50:45,893 --> 00:50:47,634
and those games are much more complicated.

1091
00:50:47,954 --> 00:50:50,235
And so at least I imagine, I haven't been on those teams,

1092
00:50:50,255 --> 00:50:53,836
I imagine that they just don't have that same level of fear of like,

1093
00:50:53,896 --> 00:50:55,377
what if we just run out of all the cards?

1094
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:58,178
At some point we will have designed all of the cards, right?

1095
00:50:58,198 --> 00:50:59,498
And that's it. We pack up shop.

1096
00:50:59,859 --> 00:51:02,900
But what happened actually on Hearthstone was that

1097
00:51:03,240 --> 00:51:06,782
there was a huge amount of design space, much, much, much more than I thought.

1098
00:51:07,082 --> 00:51:08,223
There was at the start.

1099
00:51:08,623 --> 00:51:13,787
And so, you know, it's scary to trim back and end up with a very limited amount of design space,

1100
00:51:14,227 --> 00:51:18,830
but it's just never borne out in the scary way where there's nothing left to do.

1101
00:51:19,251 --> 00:51:21,092
We always find more design space.

1102
00:51:21,412 --> 00:51:23,274
It can get more and more challenging over time,

1103
00:51:23,674 --> 00:51:26,876
but it's never run into the spot where we haven't ended up there.

1104
00:51:27,117 --> 00:51:28,257
Now, over time...

1105
00:51:28,918 --> 00:51:32,099
Your audience will stop growing, potentially, right?

1106
00:51:32,119 --> 00:51:35,120
Like, you know, we all wish audiences keep growing,

1107
00:51:35,140 --> 00:51:37,200
but at some point, maybe it's not as true.

1108
00:51:37,740 --> 00:51:40,521
And at that point, the complexity wall at the start

1109
00:51:41,161 --> 00:51:42,462
is not the thing that matters as much.

1110
00:51:43,442 --> 00:51:45,203
It's the additional complexity you're adding.

1111
00:51:45,423 --> 00:51:48,183
And so all the current players have already paid all the complexity costs.

1112
00:51:48,524 --> 00:51:50,645
And so if you add a new mechanic or a new card type

1113
00:51:50,685 --> 00:51:52,606
or a new zone or something, you just

1114
00:51:52,646 --> 00:51:55,047
have to teach them that little bit of additional complexity.

1115
00:51:55,447 --> 00:51:57,528
So you can add design space over time

1116
00:51:57,588 --> 00:52:00,110
to give yourself more room to design more stuff.

1117
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:01,110
Thank you so much.

1118
00:52:02,311 --> 00:52:02,451
Yes.

1119
00:52:04,312 --> 00:52:05,433
Thanks.

1120
00:52:05,493 --> 00:52:07,114
Most mobile games, including Hearthstone,

1121
00:52:07,134 --> 00:52:08,354
they're horizontal, right?

1122
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:11,956
At what point did you decide to use a vertical orientation?

1123
00:52:12,857 --> 00:52:14,037
What design space did that open?

1124
00:52:14,157 --> 00:52:15,958
Or did you just do it so I could play

1125
00:52:15,978 --> 00:52:17,219
while I'm driving or holding?

1126
00:52:17,559 --> 00:52:17,959
Yeah, right.

1127
00:52:19,360 --> 00:52:20,781
Please don't play Marvel's Devil While You're Driving.

1128
00:52:23,562 --> 00:52:26,183
So the question is, when did it, and why did we

1129
00:52:26,203 --> 00:52:27,864
decide to do vertical orientation?

1130
00:52:28,924 --> 00:52:32,866
I think we really wanted to make a mobile-first collectible card

1131
00:52:32,906 --> 00:52:33,106
game.

1132
00:52:33,546 --> 00:52:35,967
Most other collectible card games that are on mobile

1133
00:52:36,307 --> 00:52:40,629
feel like, or are ports of PC card games.

1134
00:52:40,689 --> 00:52:42,630
And we thought, this is just.

1135
00:52:43,290 --> 00:52:46,031
If we want this to be the best mobile collectible card game ever made,

1136
00:52:46,331 --> 00:52:47,992
I think we wanted to start vertical.

1137
00:52:48,032 --> 00:52:52,053
So we just always started the whole game with that kind of as a design constraint,

1138
00:52:52,713 --> 00:52:54,794
and tried to make sure that every decision we made...

1139
00:52:54,994 --> 00:52:56,635
We tried some weird stuff, like...

1140
00:52:57,775 --> 00:52:59,836
We weren't sure if we could fit all the locations on the screen, so...

1141
00:53:00,056 --> 00:53:03,517
We had like a carousel of locations you could swipe back and forth between,

1142
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:04,057
and that did not...

1143
00:53:04,497 --> 00:53:05,698
We didn't end up going that direction, but...

1144
00:53:05,998 --> 00:53:07,738
We were that committed to a vertical display.

1145
00:53:09,089 --> 00:53:10,989
Thank you, appreciate it.

1146
00:53:11,009 --> 00:53:13,730
So I have a question about the simplicity

1147
00:53:13,850 --> 00:53:15,210
of your text on the card.

1148
00:53:15,530 --> 00:53:19,551
So how to fix the issue of being some misunderstanding

1149
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:20,511
when the text is short?

1150
00:53:20,911 --> 00:53:23,032
Because sometimes I don't really understand

1151
00:53:23,052 --> 00:53:26,852
the whole mechanics, so I need to try

1152
00:53:26,872 --> 00:53:28,873
so I can know the real mechanics.

1153
00:53:28,893 --> 00:53:31,293
Because the other cards, I put in there

1154
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:33,454
extreme circumstance on the card,

1155
00:53:33,654 --> 00:53:34,754
but you're not using this.

1156
00:53:34,774 --> 00:53:36,394
So how do you address this issue

1157
00:53:36,434 --> 00:53:38,795
of possible misunderstanding?

1158
00:53:38,955 --> 00:53:43,759
Yeah, so the question is about what you do when there's a clash between wanting short

1159
00:53:43,840 --> 00:53:47,243
card text but being clear and making sure that people actually understand what you're

1160
00:53:47,263 --> 00:53:47,463
saying.

1161
00:53:48,044 --> 00:53:48,624
You know, it's interesting.

1162
00:53:48,644 --> 00:53:52,889
There's a bunch of cards, I think it was called Shadow Madness in Hearthstone, which says

1163
00:53:52,949 --> 00:53:56,772
take control of an enemy minion like this turn only.

1164
00:53:57,273 --> 00:53:59,635
And what it doesn't say is that it gives the minion charge, right?

1165
00:54:00,035 --> 00:54:02,617
If you took control of an enemy minion, you wouldn't normally be able to attack with it.

1166
00:54:03,017 --> 00:54:08,419
But the fact that it's only for this turn, it's obvious that you must be able to attack with it.

1167
00:54:08,479 --> 00:54:10,340
And so we just kind of left that off the card.

1168
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:14,282
There's some stuff, there's some types of designs where you can just say,

1169
00:54:14,342 --> 00:54:15,423
look, this is like a little bit...

1170
00:54:16,524 --> 00:54:20,607
We don't explain everything, but you can just try it,

1171
00:54:21,348 --> 00:54:23,570
and you'll learn after the first time.

1172
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:28,295
And ideally, the best scenario for you

1173
00:54:28,335 --> 00:54:29,296
is the thing that actually happens.

1174
00:54:29,596 --> 00:54:31,298
We often, when showing people cards,

1175
00:54:31,398 --> 00:54:32,439
and they ask a question like, well,

1176
00:54:32,459 --> 00:54:34,260
I'm not sure about this edge case,

1177
00:54:34,681 --> 00:54:35,662
we say, well, what do you think?

1178
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:37,803
What's your suspicion?

1179
00:54:38,223 --> 00:54:39,384
And we would write it down.

1180
00:54:39,504 --> 00:54:41,425
And if the suspicion is the correct thing,

1181
00:54:41,965 --> 00:54:43,666
it might be worth it for us to have less text.

1182
00:54:43,726 --> 00:54:44,367
Because they would be like,

1183
00:54:44,387 --> 00:54:45,587
I'm not sure, but I think it's going to do this.

1184
00:54:46,088 --> 00:54:47,608
That was good enough for us in a lot of cases.

1185
00:54:48,689 --> 00:54:51,911
But yeah, if the answer was they got the wrong thing

1186
00:54:51,991 --> 00:54:52,751
or they couldn't guess,

1187
00:54:53,191 --> 00:54:54,212
we would try and rewrite the card,

1188
00:54:54,252 --> 00:54:55,693
even if it meant adding more text.

1189
00:54:56,333 --> 00:54:59,075
So follow the intuitive software.

1190
00:54:59,455 --> 00:55:00,075
What was that?

1191
00:55:00,115 --> 00:55:02,016
Follow the intuitive software.

1192
00:55:02,456 --> 00:55:03,297
Yes, right.

1193
00:55:03,357 --> 00:55:04,718
We try to make it intuitive, exactly.

1194
00:55:04,998 --> 00:55:05,378
Thank you, sir.

1195
00:55:05,618 --> 00:55:06,138
Thank you, appreciate it.

1196
00:55:08,117 --> 00:55:09,798
Thank you, I have so many questions.

1197
00:55:09,938 --> 00:55:12,680
But I do want to ask about Fatui.

1198
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:15,681
You talked about how a lot of design

1199
00:55:15,741 --> 00:55:18,983
is going into how to minimize the zero-sum game

1200
00:55:19,023 --> 00:55:21,324
and also using things like bot

1201
00:55:21,384 --> 00:55:23,084
to increase player satisfaction.

1202
00:55:23,104 --> 00:55:26,026
So I'm wondering what are some design iteration

1203
00:55:26,046 --> 00:55:29,648
or choices that went into the first-time player experience

1204
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:33,489
to make sure that players have that sort of satisfaction

1205
00:55:33,770 --> 00:55:35,150
and how that impact, you know, like,

1206
00:55:35,590 --> 00:55:40,933
What kind of cards they get when they first play the game, and if they're going to see any bots, etc.

1207
00:55:40,953 --> 00:55:47,757
Yeah, so I basically, for both the Hearthstone first-time user experience,

1208
00:55:47,797 --> 00:55:53,660
I'm sorry, the question was how do we make sure that Fatui is awesome, especially with the zero-sum component.

1209
00:55:54,100 --> 00:55:58,282
Yeah, or just any design-related consideration with the Fatui.

1210
00:55:58,902 --> 00:56:05,965
So the entire Fatui for Hearthstone and Marvel Snap is just copied from George Fan's talk that I mentioned.

1211
00:56:05,985 --> 00:56:10,147
We just laid it out and we just copied it. It's like exactly that.

1212
00:56:10,327 --> 00:56:15,730
If you play through Hearthstone and Snap and Plants vs. Zombies, we just stole it all.

1213
00:56:15,770 --> 00:56:22,753
It's just genius work. So if you're interested in Fatui design, that is the master class of Fatui design right there.

1214
00:56:22,773 --> 00:56:23,833
I think it's fantastic.

1215
00:56:24,313 --> 00:56:24,834
Thank you.

1216
00:56:25,794 --> 00:56:25,914
Yes.

1217
00:56:26,813 --> 00:56:30,796
Hello. I have a kind of similar question that was asked over there, but as you mentioned,

1218
00:56:30,836 --> 00:56:34,699
Marble Snap doesn't have keywords, which expanded the amount of text on the card.

1219
00:56:35,600 --> 00:56:37,862
But when you have keywords, a player has to learn those.

1220
00:56:38,002 --> 00:56:43,346
So how do you balance the kind of streamlined paraphrasing versus the explicit explanations?

1221
00:56:44,587 --> 00:56:48,349
Yeah, the question is, keywords versus no keywords, how do you balance those two things?

1222
00:56:49,150 --> 00:56:50,851
I paraphrased your question.

1223
00:56:53,692 --> 00:56:54,772
This was a conscious choice.

1224
00:56:55,093 --> 00:57:02,037
When you have keywords, you are trading complexity for potential depth, right?

1225
00:57:02,057 --> 00:57:04,258
Because you get more interesting stuff on the card,

1226
00:57:04,278 --> 00:57:07,320
you can make the card do more interesting things if you can add more words to it.

1227
00:57:08,221 --> 00:57:09,681
But if you don't know what the keywords do,

1228
00:57:09,701 --> 00:57:11,683
then you can't understand what the card does.

1229
00:57:12,143 --> 00:57:15,124
And so for Snap, we made the conscious decision,

1230
00:57:15,204 --> 00:57:17,004
actually our first design said no keywords,

1231
00:57:17,044 --> 00:57:19,985
and eventually, I tried to represent onReveal

1232
00:57:20,045 --> 00:57:23,247
as like present tense and ongoing as like,

1233
00:57:23,267 --> 00:57:24,867
like it's just a different tense,

1234
00:57:24,947 --> 00:57:26,148
and people weren't picking up on it,

1235
00:57:26,168 --> 00:57:28,688
so I felt like we were forced to add onReveal and ongoing.

1236
00:57:29,669 --> 00:57:32,250
But those keywords are self-descriptive, right?

1237
00:57:32,270 --> 00:57:33,690
Like there's no way to actually like,

1238
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:35,611
find out what onReveal means.

1239
00:57:35,871 --> 00:57:38,752
It's not in the game, it just happens when it reveals, right?

1240
00:57:40,252 --> 00:57:46,394
So we made the decision to, instead of adding more depth

1241
00:57:46,414 --> 00:57:49,856
by having more keywords, to make every card understandable.

1242
00:57:49,936 --> 00:57:51,536
Even if you'd never played Marvel Snap before,

1243
00:57:51,856 --> 00:57:53,277
you can read a card and hopefully

1244
00:57:53,637 --> 00:57:54,637
get what it's trying to convey.

1245
00:57:55,558 --> 00:57:55,938
Thank you.

1246
00:57:56,038 --> 00:57:56,318
Thank you.

1247
00:57:57,398 --> 00:57:57,998
There's two minutes left.

1248
00:57:58,038 --> 00:57:58,579
Is that what that is?

1249
00:57:59,399 --> 00:57:59,519
Yes.

1250
00:58:00,057 --> 00:58:10,504
Hi, when you were designing the game, because it was a studio that was fresh, did you get the IP from Marvel that decided,

1251
00:58:10,664 --> 00:58:15,928
I'm going to make a Marvel game, or was it, I'm going to make a game, and it's going to be a card game, or it's going to be whatever,

1252
00:58:16,028 --> 00:58:18,949
and then, ooh, what if we got the IP and made it Marvel-themed?

1253
00:58:19,050 --> 00:58:19,170
Yeah.

1254
00:58:19,490 --> 00:58:21,450
So the question is, what came first, Marvel or the game mechanics?

1255
00:58:21,490 --> 00:58:22,930
The answer is Marvel. Marvel came first.

1256
00:58:22,950 --> 00:58:25,811
In fact, we started working on a different game,

1257
00:58:25,991 --> 00:58:28,772
and the Marvel thing started to happen a little bit more,

1258
00:58:29,492 --> 00:58:31,452
we started skinning that game as a Marvel game.

1259
00:58:31,972 --> 00:58:33,172
And when we were doing that, we were like,

1260
00:58:33,192 --> 00:58:35,113
this is not working, this is not a Marvel game.

1261
00:58:35,133 --> 00:58:36,493
The things that are awesome about Marvel,

1262
00:58:36,533 --> 00:58:39,514
which is an awesome hero fighting against an awesome supervillain,

1263
00:58:39,534 --> 00:58:41,534
or a team of heroes facing off a supervillain,

1264
00:58:42,334 --> 00:58:43,934
that's not what this game is about, right?

1265
00:58:45,575 --> 00:58:50,179
We took a step back and said, okay, what if we designed a game from scratch to highlight what's awesome about Marvel,

1266
00:58:50,219 --> 00:58:51,159
which is that experience.

1267
00:58:51,600 --> 00:58:57,244
And so we made a card game where the focus is on that one card type, the heroes and villains of Marvel, and that's kind of,

1268
00:58:58,125 --> 00:58:59,326
so, Marvel came first.

1269
00:59:01,751 --> 00:59:04,972
Hey, so the monetization in Marvel Snaps

1270
00:59:04,992 --> 00:59:06,432
is really player-friendly.

1271
00:59:06,512 --> 00:59:08,192
I was just curious what the overall philosophy

1272
00:59:08,252 --> 00:59:10,353
for Second Inners monetization is,

1273
00:59:10,893 --> 00:59:12,934
how you guys feel, how do you integrate it

1274
00:59:12,994 --> 00:59:15,274
into the design, and what were some

1275
00:59:15,294 --> 00:59:16,415
of the models you guys threw out?

1276
00:59:20,333 --> 00:59:25,898
You know, it was difficult because there's not a lot of games that have a lot of analog

1277
00:59:25,918 --> 00:59:26,879
to the way we're doing things, right?

1278
00:59:26,899 --> 00:59:30,462
A game where you have thousands of cards, you could sell booster packs, right, pretty

1279
00:59:30,502 --> 00:59:30,743
easily.

1280
00:59:30,983 --> 00:59:33,005
We have like 100, like 200 cards, right?

1281
00:59:33,045 --> 00:59:34,586
Way less than other card games.

1282
00:59:35,307 --> 00:59:37,908
And in games with that few cards, games like Clash Royale,

1283
00:59:38,409 --> 00:59:40,650
a lot of these games sell power, right?

1284
00:59:40,670 --> 00:59:42,471
You can just get higher numbers by spending more money.

1285
00:59:42,791 --> 00:59:45,793
And because of the way the game works, like the crunchy numbers we have,

1286
00:59:46,193 --> 00:59:48,174
like the math gets really hard if you had like,

1287
00:59:48,234 --> 00:59:50,616
okay, I need to get 623 more power over here,

1288
00:59:50,656 --> 00:59:52,697
and he's got 426 less over here, how do I...

1289
00:59:53,057 --> 00:59:53,978
It's just, it's really challenging.

1290
00:59:54,198 --> 00:59:55,699
So there wasn't a lot of analogs for us.

1291
00:59:56,179 --> 00:59:59,201
And the one that was the biggest inspiration was actually Pokemon Go,

1292
00:59:59,221 --> 01:00:02,463
because it's a collectible game. We really wanted to focus on being a collectible game.

1293
01:00:02,884 --> 01:00:07,327
And I think that they have a monetization system where you can't buy Pokemon in that game, right?

1294
01:00:07,667 --> 01:00:09,308
If you see somebody else with incredible Pokemon, you're like,

1295
01:00:09,328 --> 01:00:10,749
damn, you play a lot of Pokemon Go.

1296
01:00:10,769 --> 01:00:12,570
You're never like, damn, you spent a lot of money, dog.

1297
01:00:13,030 --> 01:00:14,772
It's all about the effort you put in.

1298
01:00:15,132 --> 01:00:20,756
And so trying to come up with a solution that involved being able to speed up your process.

1299
01:00:21,776 --> 01:00:24,218
And go up the collection track faster.

1300
01:00:24,418 --> 01:00:27,200
That was basically the only inspiration we had.

1301
01:00:27,220 --> 01:00:29,002
All right, well thank you so much.

1302
01:00:29,022 --> 01:00:30,323
I'm so sorry I didn't get to all your questions.

1303
01:00:30,363 --> 01:00:30,843
Thank you everybody.

1304
01:00:30,863 --> 01:00:31,043
Thank you.
