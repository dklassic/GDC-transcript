1
00:00:11,993 --> 00:00:16,614
Hi, how are you guys? My name is David Lucio, and I'm here to talk about the

2
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:21,215
resolve of the Latin American gaming industry. I'm a content creator and

3
00:00:21,215 --> 00:00:25,316
filmmaker from Panama, well actually from Colombia. I lived in Panama for the

4
00:00:25,316 --> 00:00:31,237
last 20 something years. And I wanted to talk about something that I've found

5
00:00:31,237 --> 00:00:35,098
that I've seen throughout my experience, and that I think could help out the

6
00:00:36,158 --> 00:00:41,261
the indie dev community in Latin America specifically. But first I wanted to talk about

7
00:00:41,261 --> 00:00:47,105
the name of the talk. It's even though it's called the Resolve of the Latin America gaming industry,

8
00:00:47,105 --> 00:00:52,369
I'm really talking about something called Gara. Gara is this concept that we use to compare

9
00:00:52,369 --> 00:00:54,930
some soccer teams actually specifically. And it's so not...

10
00:00:55,050 --> 00:00:59,353
So there's no one better to actually explain what Gara is than Diego Forlan,

11
00:00:59,353 --> 00:01:00,854
the captain of the Uruguayan team.

12
00:01:00,854 --> 00:01:04,717
Basically, it's it's like when you don't have that last breath,

13
00:01:04,717 --> 00:01:06,678
but you always want to give more.

14
00:01:06,678 --> 00:01:10,741
And I think there's nothing that encapsulates more the the the fire

15
00:01:10,741 --> 00:01:14,103
and the status of the actual gaming industry in Latin America right now.

16
00:01:14,103 --> 00:01:17,345
So the actual name of this stock, it's like a real industry

17
00:01:17,345 --> 00:01:19,266
that you know, already Ghana.

18
00:01:19,266 --> 00:01:22,508
And it's from the point of view of a passionate gamer and content creator

19
00:01:22,508 --> 00:01:24,670
that just really wants to find ways to help.

20
00:01:25,574 --> 00:01:31,196
So who is this dude? So let me introduce myself. As I said before, my name is David Lucio.

21
00:01:31,196 --> 00:01:37,237
I'm a filmmaker and content creator with a big passion for games. I've been creating content

22
00:01:37,237 --> 00:01:43,319
in several platforms for the last six, seven years. I work with Sony, for Sony Channel,

23
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:47,360
around all Latin America. We have a program that goes to 23 countries and we

24
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,982
co-host that with my wife. I actually do everything with my wife and you'll see her.

25
00:01:52,142 --> 00:01:58,608
appear in several of the of the slides, so I'll get there. But I'm also just like turned 35 and

26
00:01:58,608 --> 00:02:03,192
I'm going through a midlife crisis while trying to get in the gaming industry to help develop

27
00:02:03,192 --> 00:02:09,418
my region's visibility and opportunities. But I really wanted to talk about why I love games.

28
00:02:09,418 --> 00:02:15,023
I love games for something that I think relates to a lot of people in Latin America and is that

29
00:02:15,023 --> 00:02:15,623
like many.

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:20,634
I actually learned English through movies and video games.

31
00:02:20,634 --> 00:02:22,756
We didn't get localized games in the 90s

32
00:02:22,756 --> 00:02:24,117
and early 2000s in our regions.

33
00:02:24,117 --> 00:02:27,741
So most of it was in English, so we read a lot.

34
00:02:27,741 --> 00:02:30,724
I'm sure I learned most of my English

35
00:02:30,724 --> 00:02:32,966
through Final Fantasy games and Metal Gear games

36
00:02:32,966 --> 00:02:34,147
and stuff like that.

37
00:02:34,147 --> 00:02:36,909
And also I'm an immigrant.

38
00:02:36,909 --> 00:02:41,033
I flew from Colombia when I was seven years old to Panama.

39
00:02:41,434 --> 00:02:45,657
and I had no communities, I have no families, I had no friends or anything.

40
00:02:45,657 --> 00:02:50,761
So games actually helped me through that and games gave me a window of opportunity again

41
00:02:50,761 --> 00:02:56,265
to meet with new people and that aligned with my interests and I also created some enemies

42
00:02:56,265 --> 00:03:00,649
because we played a lot of Mario Kart and Mario Party in 64 but I digress.

43
00:03:00,649 --> 00:03:05,973
And then the third reason is that it eventually led me to content creation.

44
00:03:06,790 --> 00:03:13,612
I've always been fascinated with the narrative aspect of games, and I've always been doing

45
00:03:13,612 --> 00:03:18,673
video stuff, specifically with my wife and my partners, we do a lot of video content.

46
00:03:18,673 --> 00:03:25,855
So when the opportunity presented itself to do something with my tools, to actually pursue

47
00:03:25,855 --> 00:03:28,095
something that I was passionate about, was amazing.

48
00:03:28,095 --> 00:03:29,816
And that's when Patacoins came.

49
00:03:30,314 --> 00:03:34,636
came into the picture. But that goes to the first platform I actually

50
00:03:34,636 --> 00:03:38,397
created in Panama. I did it with a couple of friends. It ended up being

51
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:41,359
one of the biggest platforms of content in our in our in our country.

52
00:03:41,359 --> 00:03:41,399
Um

53
00:03:41,399 --> 00:03:46,621
It was something that started with a couple of friends that just we just

54
00:03:46,621 --> 00:03:50,762
met weekly to play Dnd games. And most of the time we ended up like

55
00:03:50,762 --> 00:03:52,063
discussing

56
00:03:52,063 --> 00:03:56,165
video games and movies. So I wasn't that, um

57
00:03:57,598 --> 00:03:59,299
I wasn't that big of a consumer.

58
00:03:59,299 --> 00:04:01,501
I wasn't that of a big of a consumer

59
00:04:01,501 --> 00:04:03,062
of like YouTube channels and stuff like that.

60
00:04:03,062 --> 00:04:06,064
So I really didn't know what type of content was out there

61
00:04:06,064 --> 00:04:09,267
but I did know that I would love to see the content

62
00:04:09,267 --> 00:04:13,510
that we were basically doing with my wife and our friends.

63
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,112
So that's where Patacoins comes in.

64
00:04:15,112 --> 00:04:18,434
And it actually created a lot of opportunities for us

65
00:04:18,434 --> 00:04:22,257
because that's when we started covering big events

66
00:04:22,257 --> 00:04:23,478
like E3 and Paxes.

67
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:29,040
So a podcast where we talk to different talents in our region.

68
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:32,540
We helped produce the first Comic-Con in Panama

69
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,921
by developing some talks and some panels.

70
00:04:35,921 --> 00:04:39,762
One specifically dedicated on how women in Panama

71
00:04:39,762 --> 00:04:43,703
specifically are dominating the content creation side of gaming.

72
00:04:43,703 --> 00:04:46,364
We've done a lot of events to meet our community

73
00:04:46,364 --> 00:04:48,464
and to help them thrive in some ways.

74
00:04:48,464 --> 00:04:50,865
And we've also done events in Panama with several sponsors.

75
00:04:50,865 --> 00:04:53,145
Like for instance, that picture down there,

76
00:04:53,145 --> 00:04:53,745
it's...

77
00:04:54,346 --> 00:04:58,928
We did like a big event in Panama for Pokemon Go when that blew up.

78
00:04:58,928 --> 00:05:02,910
And from these, Patacoins lasted for like five, six years.

79
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:05,091
It became really big. It was really cool.

80
00:05:05,091 --> 00:05:07,973
But then my wife and I, Stefania and I, wanted to...

81
00:05:09,525 --> 00:05:24,949
Trying to things. So we started LWS if you show and that's the thing we're doing right now. So it's basically a space where we talk about games, movies and everything. We're specifically a twitch channel where we try to focus a lot in indie games and we've been trying to.

82
00:05:26,118 --> 00:05:31,440
to tell people about wishlisting, which is like a term that in Latin America, we don't really use.

83
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:37,102
So it's something that has a big importance for us. We've been working on this for the

84
00:05:37,102 --> 00:05:41,903
past two years, and that led me eventually to understand the power and value of community.

85
00:05:43,709 --> 00:05:47,490
Without the community we ended up growing with,

86
00:05:47,490 --> 00:05:49,951
we wouldn't be able to do what we're doing right now.

87
00:05:49,951 --> 00:05:53,193
And I also want to think that when you do have a community,

88
00:05:53,193 --> 00:05:56,254
you have a responsibility to use your platform for good

89
00:05:56,254 --> 00:05:57,335
in some way.

90
00:05:57,335 --> 00:06:00,056
And the way we're trying to do it is through

91
00:06:00,056 --> 00:06:03,417
helping other artists or other up and coming creators

92
00:06:03,417 --> 00:06:04,918
to have a platform to jump into.

93
00:06:06,168 --> 00:06:14,076
And in that search of community and search for allowing our community to grow and thrive,

94
00:06:14,076 --> 00:06:16,878
I started thinking about gaming communities.

95
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:19,100
And that's the first time I went to a mix.

96
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,562
And the mix blew my mind.

97
00:06:21,562 --> 00:06:26,127
That was the first time that I came face to face with a lot of indie developers, side

98
00:06:26,127 --> 00:06:29,650
by side, and talked to them about their experience and everything.

99
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:31,852
And what I realized being there is that

100
00:06:32,652 --> 00:06:37,156
without me knowing it, because we were always trying to look for Spanish speaking people in the

101
00:06:37,156 --> 00:06:41,620
dev industry, in the game industry, to actually interview for our channels, but it was really

102
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:48,868
hard for us to find them. And in an event like Mix and another small event for Indie titles,

103
00:06:48,868 --> 00:06:56,595
we actually met a lot of dev teams from Mexico and Argentina, Colombia, Uruguay, and that blew my mind.

104
00:06:57,158 --> 00:07:00,542
I understood that searching for Latin American games was hard,

105
00:07:00,542 --> 00:07:03,264
and it shouldn't be that hard, specifically because I think

106
00:07:03,264 --> 00:07:05,386
representation really matters.

107
00:07:05,386 --> 00:07:08,169
And I'm not talking only about seeing yourself

108
00:07:08,169 --> 00:07:10,952
on screen, which really is hard for us in Latin America.

109
00:07:10,952 --> 00:07:14,195
We're talking about 3% of the characters in games are Latino,

110
00:07:14,195 --> 00:07:17,298
and then from that 3%, only 5% is playable.

111
00:07:17,298 --> 00:07:19,460
So we do want to see us on screen,

112
00:07:19,460 --> 00:07:21,742
and there's so much potential from everything.

113
00:07:22,528 --> 00:07:24,390
from our culture, from our heritage,

114
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:25,331
from the stories we tell,

115
00:07:25,331 --> 00:07:28,415
from the backgrounds we come from,

116
00:07:28,415 --> 00:07:30,397
what we've learned through games.

117
00:07:30,397 --> 00:07:32,740
Like for instance, this is a great example

118
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:33,862
of a game called Crystals,

119
00:07:33,862 --> 00:07:36,845
which was developed in Colombia.

120
00:07:36,845 --> 00:07:37,786
For most people,

121
00:07:38,047 --> 00:07:44,412
they see that picture on the right and they think, okay, this game has great visuals and

122
00:07:44,412 --> 00:07:50,397
lore and world design and that's amazing and it really does. The game is amazing.

123
00:07:50,397 --> 00:07:55,141
But on the other side of it, us, like for me as a Colombian, watching this was like, oh my god,

124
00:07:55,141 --> 00:08:00,246
I can't fucking believe I'm actually fighting baddies in front of El Santuario de las Lajas.

125
00:08:00,246 --> 00:08:02,868
That's a place that's really important in my country.

126
00:08:03,428 --> 00:08:08,410
and seeing yourself. Seeing yourself is huge and not only being able to relate to a character

127
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:13,932
specifically but relating to a world and to the experience and the color palette and everything.

128
00:08:13,932 --> 00:08:18,253
We have something in Latin America coming from Colombia that's called

129
00:08:18,253 --> 00:08:25,136
el realismo magico, like a magical realism where we have found how our culture is so

130
00:08:25,516 --> 00:08:30,419
fused with the fantastical and the dreamlike.

131
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,561
And I think that being captured through games

132
00:08:32,561 --> 00:08:33,902
can be fantastic.

133
00:08:33,902 --> 00:08:35,283
And we are thriving.

134
00:08:35,283 --> 00:08:36,944
I mean, even though I'm going to talk about

135
00:08:36,944 --> 00:08:38,145
a lot of struggles that I think

136
00:08:38,145 --> 00:08:41,087
the Latin American gaming industry is going through,

137
00:08:41,087 --> 00:08:42,428
I do think that we're thriving

138
00:08:42,428 --> 00:08:44,489
through a lot of different experiences.

139
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:46,690
Like just this group of six games,

140
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:47,771
we're talking about Crystal,

141
00:08:47,771 --> 00:08:50,193
that's a turn-based RPG from Columbia.

142
00:08:50,193 --> 00:08:51,534
We have Bug Fables,

143
00:08:51,534 --> 00:08:53,395
that's a Paper Mario type RPG game

144
00:08:53,395 --> 00:08:54,516
that came from Panama.

145
00:08:54,896 --> 00:08:57,858
Mulaka is an action-adventure game from Mexico.

146
00:08:57,858 --> 00:09:00,579
Tunche is a side-scrolling beat-em-up from Peru.

147
00:09:00,579 --> 00:09:05,642
Aztec Forgotten Gods just came out and it really explores the Aztec

148
00:09:05,642 --> 00:09:07,523
culture and the lore behind it.

149
00:09:07,523 --> 00:09:12,506
And even Tremaine, it's a puzzle platformer with a great story that comes from Argentina.

150
00:09:12,506 --> 00:09:17,769
So we're really infusing our DNA in a lot of genres and I think that can only explode.

151
00:09:17,769 --> 00:09:18,410
And

152
00:09:19,292 --> 00:09:25,741
On top of that, the industry as a whole is really growing and steadily growing year by year.

153
00:09:25,741 --> 00:09:30,106
You can see how in PC, mobile and console there's growth year by year.

154
00:09:30,106 --> 00:09:36,855
Specifically, for instance, in the mobile area, it's growing almost, it's almost doubling itself year on year.

155
00:09:37,649 --> 00:09:39,490
And I think, well, not I think.

156
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:42,411
One of the main reasons for this is,

157
00:09:42,411 --> 00:09:44,773
and that's one of the struggles I'm gonna talk later on,

158
00:09:44,773 --> 00:09:46,593
the financial opportunities we have.

159
00:09:46,593 --> 00:09:48,935
Like not a lot of people can actually afford a console

160
00:09:48,935 --> 00:09:50,815
or a big ass PC in our countries.

161
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:52,776
So we do have that gadget in our phone,

162
00:09:52,776 --> 00:09:54,277
we do have a cell phone.

163
00:09:54,277 --> 00:09:56,718
So a lot of our developers are actually developing experience

164
00:09:56,718 --> 00:09:59,119
for mobile that are doing really good.

165
00:09:59,119 --> 00:10:01,361
And that's one way that indie games can actually get

166
00:10:01,361 --> 00:10:03,141
in the hands of Latin American consumers.

167
00:10:04,312 --> 00:10:13,439
And the other cool thing about it is that that has led to a growth, also on the content creation side, like just last year the past two years we've seen how.

168
00:10:15,925 --> 00:10:18,106
our content creators are breaking record,

169
00:10:18,106 --> 00:10:21,107
are breaking audience records all around the world.

170
00:10:21,107 --> 00:10:22,728
Just the graph, I know he's from Spain

171
00:10:22,728 --> 00:10:25,929
and we're talking about 2.4 million people watching him.

172
00:10:25,929 --> 00:10:28,550
But I think that the important information

173
00:10:28,550 --> 00:10:31,932
to get out of this is that that's the market

174
00:10:31,932 --> 00:10:34,853
that's out there, that's the size of the audience

175
00:10:34,853 --> 00:10:36,434
that's looking for Spanish,

176
00:10:37,915 --> 00:10:45,058
led content. It's huge. And that's also something that will relate eventually to something that I

177
00:10:45,058 --> 00:10:51,300
think it's really important for indie devs and it's watching or seeing Latin America as a really,

178
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:53,841
really big audience for opportunity for audiences.

179
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:58,454
Like I was telling just that Twitch grew twice almost

180
00:10:58,454 --> 00:11:00,655
in all of our countries in the last couple of years

181
00:11:00,655 --> 00:11:02,796
during the pandemic.

182
00:11:02,796 --> 00:11:04,197
But even though all of that is growing,

183
00:11:04,197 --> 00:11:06,578
even though the consumer side is growing,

184
00:11:06,578 --> 00:11:08,579
even though the industry as a whole is growing,

185
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:10,980
even though the content creator opportunities

186
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:12,021
are really, really thriving,

187
00:11:12,021 --> 00:11:14,282
and we're actually developing a lot of games

188
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:16,242
in the last couple of years,

189
00:11:16,242 --> 00:11:18,984
we do go through a lot of struggles.

190
00:11:18,984 --> 00:11:22,365
And I think you can sum them down to five.

191
00:11:23,277 --> 00:11:25,218
The first one is education.

192
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,819
Most of our countries don't have real careers

193
00:11:28,819 --> 00:11:31,521
behind game development or animation or programming

194
00:11:31,521 --> 00:11:32,721
or anything like that.

195
00:11:32,721 --> 00:11:34,822
That's based basically in the sense

196
00:11:34,822 --> 00:11:37,923
that that industry of games is not really recognized

197
00:11:37,923 --> 00:11:40,664
as an industry still in most of our countries.

198
00:11:40,664 --> 00:11:45,987
And the ones that do are starting to create projects

199
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:47,287
and scholarships and stuff.

200
00:11:47,587 --> 00:11:48,868
but it's not a big thing.

201
00:11:48,868 --> 00:11:51,071
So actually for people in our country, in our regions,

202
00:11:51,071 --> 00:11:54,234
in our region, my bad, to actually get a good education

203
00:11:54,234 --> 00:11:56,136
and start developing games is really hard.

204
00:11:56,136 --> 00:11:57,998
The other one is visibility.

205
00:11:57,998 --> 00:12:01,342
Like I was telling you, finding our games is hard.

206
00:12:02,180 --> 00:12:05,202
we do have to go to an event in person and just

207
00:12:05,202 --> 00:12:07,443
skim through and find people and talk to them.

208
00:12:07,443 --> 00:12:12,066
And that's a great way to actually meet a network around.

209
00:12:12,066 --> 00:12:15,007
But it's a tough place to be in as an industry

210
00:12:15,007 --> 00:12:17,949
if you have to actually go to these types of shows to find you,

211
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:21,351
not only finding the game, but actually finding out they are Latin American.

212
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,882
We also have problems with tech.

213
00:12:23,882 --> 00:12:26,885
I was watching a talk yesterday, and they

214
00:12:26,885 --> 00:12:29,428
were talking about how, because of visa restrictions

215
00:12:29,428 --> 00:12:31,530
and financial restrictions and everything,

216
00:12:31,530 --> 00:12:33,993
a lot of teams from Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia,

217
00:12:33,993 --> 00:12:37,316
and big countries, have been just really putting

218
00:12:37,316 --> 00:12:40,179
their deaf kids in their bags and bringing them over.

219
00:12:40,179 --> 00:12:43,163
Just having access to the tech is really hard.

220
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,264
Financing, again.

221
00:12:45,003 --> 00:12:50,304
I think this has come several times, not only from the consumer side, it's tough, but also

222
00:12:50,304 --> 00:12:55,385
most of the arts in our countries have been have developed in the last couple of years

223
00:12:55,385 --> 00:12:59,126
because of support from governmental initiatives.

224
00:12:59,126 --> 00:13:04,367
So let's say like the film industry in Panama or Colombia, we have a law that states that

225
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:06,008
the government through their cultural.

226
00:13:07,353 --> 00:13:14,575
branch has to actually donate money or help finance and bootstrap projects in film, and that

227
00:13:14,575 --> 00:13:19,076
has helped actually the film industry to thrive. We need this and we're getting some of this in

228
00:13:19,076 --> 00:13:23,697
some of our countries, but that's literally something that we depend on. So it all goes

229
00:13:23,697 --> 00:13:27,618
down to crowdfunding and stuff, and I'm going to talk about some struggle that crowdfunding has too.

230
00:13:27,618 --> 00:13:31,698
And then finally localization, and this is something that has been part of the industry

231
00:13:31,698 --> 00:13:34,759
for a while now. And not only thinking about

232
00:13:34,993 --> 00:13:40,515
the way people can consume games because we're not a bilingual region at all.

233
00:13:41,493 --> 00:13:43,755
Not only how consumers consume games,

234
00:13:43,755 --> 00:13:45,837
but also for dev teams,

235
00:13:45,837 --> 00:13:47,979
it's an additional expense that we have to think to,

236
00:13:47,979 --> 00:13:49,980
to actually publish a game.

237
00:13:49,980 --> 00:13:54,704
So all of these combined are big obstacles for us.

238
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,986
And how do I think we can battle this,

239
00:13:56,986 --> 00:13:59,489
or at least what I found in my years creating content

240
00:13:59,489 --> 00:14:01,170
and trying to create communities and stuff.

241
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,233
I think this is the biggest takeaway of all,

242
00:14:04,233 --> 00:14:06,395
or at least what I've gotten from the gaming industry

243
00:14:06,395 --> 00:14:08,576
in the last couple of years, and that's collaboration.

244
00:14:09,522 --> 00:14:15,103
It is a fragment of the industry that depends on collaboration to actually keep going through.

245
00:14:15,103 --> 00:14:25,925
So I'm going to share some examples of stuff we've done with our communities and our platforms here in Panama to actually help on the aspects that I think might need help through collaborating.

246
00:14:25,925 --> 00:14:34,667
The first one is finding points of collaboration between development, development teams and communities or content creators.

247
00:14:35,111 --> 00:14:37,875
For instance, this is a game by World Eater Games.

248
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,798
It's a game called Bittersweet Birthday.

249
00:14:39,798 --> 00:14:42,603
It's a boss battle RPG type game.

250
00:14:42,603 --> 00:14:45,166
And they were looking to crowdfund.

251
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,009
It wasn't actually going steadily.

252
00:14:47,009 --> 00:14:49,693
So we, I'm sorry, we began a campaign.

253
00:14:50,367 --> 00:14:52,909
where we gave that game, one of the bus fights

254
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,450
to a lot of content creators in Panama.

255
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,631
And they started streaming it through a challenge

256
00:14:56,631 --> 00:14:58,092
of what's called a bittersweet challenge.

257
00:14:58,092 --> 00:15:00,033
And it was to see how many tries it got them

258
00:15:00,033 --> 00:15:01,434
to actually beat the bus.

259
00:15:01,434 --> 00:15:03,675
And that spread the word and they got their game funded

260
00:15:03,675 --> 00:15:04,636
like in that weekend.

261
00:15:04,636 --> 00:15:06,277
So those types of collaborations

262
00:15:06,277 --> 00:15:07,638
are really good for our games.

263
00:15:08,602 --> 00:15:22,873
Also, collaborating between devs, and I know there's a lot of communities already in social networks that I'm going to talk to you later on that actually help in this way, but also like just small teams, just network and find other teams and

264
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:31,080
find ways to collaborate, like we are throughout an event that we do it's called to each other that I'm going to talk to you about in a in a further slide.

265
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:38,149
One of the things we're trying to do is create opportunities for academia and for people to actually go and learn stuff.

266
00:15:38,149 --> 00:15:48,283
So doing this and creating windows again, where devs can collaborate with devs and talk and share ideas, it's really helpful like for instance when we did this panel.

267
00:15:49,037 --> 00:15:52,399
we had like a 30 minute cool off before the chat

268
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:55,020
and they were just talking about how they were working.

269
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,241
And one of them was having issues in the moment,

270
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:59,763
getting their money from one of the crowdfunding sites

271
00:15:59,763 --> 00:16:01,063
because they were in Panama

272
00:16:01,063 --> 00:16:05,205
and they couldn't get an account number to get it in.

273
00:16:05,205 --> 00:16:08,147
And then the Jeff from Columbia tell them how they did.

274
00:16:08,147 --> 00:16:10,628
So like only getting those spaces

275
00:16:10,628 --> 00:16:12,869
where you can actually exchange information is great.

276
00:16:12,869 --> 00:16:15,050
And if you can add that on top of like an event

277
00:16:15,050 --> 00:16:17,151
where you can actually reach bigger communities

278
00:16:17,151 --> 00:16:18,072
and maybe help.

279
00:16:18,972 --> 00:16:32,720
Um, what's that what's the word I'm looking for help inspire new up and coming challenge. That's a talent I mean, that's amazing. And also good collaboration between content creators like we as content creators have to understand that we are part

280
00:16:32,720 --> 00:16:34,281
of the gaming industry as a whole.

281
00:16:34,701 --> 00:16:45,031
And our gaming industry is going to thrive even more when we understand that we have to help out, but also helping each other out because that way we can all grow.

282
00:16:45,031 --> 00:16:51,537
Like for instance we do a lot of events in Panama like even though we have a social media platform and we do have.

283
00:16:52,508 --> 00:16:54,270
the Twitch channel for us.

284
00:16:54,270 --> 00:16:56,692
One of the main focuses of our platform

285
00:16:56,692 --> 00:16:58,433
is to constantly create opportunities

286
00:16:58,433 --> 00:17:00,675
to collaborate with other content creators.

287
00:17:00,675 --> 00:17:05,619
Not only for the idea of bringing new audiences,

288
00:17:05,619 --> 00:17:10,103
but also hopefully give a platform

289
00:17:10,103 --> 00:17:13,526
for up and coming small creators

290
00:17:13,526 --> 00:17:15,067
that can use our platform

291
00:17:15,067 --> 00:17:16,889
to actually get to a bigger audience.

292
00:17:16,889 --> 00:17:19,611
And also understand that even though we are

293
00:17:20,524 --> 00:17:24,887
part of the game industry, and we're like a sub niche of the game industry or the Latin

294
00:17:24,887 --> 00:17:29,770
American game industry. If we can open our doors and collaborate outside of our borders,

295
00:17:29,770 --> 00:17:35,033
it's amazing. One of the things I've learned specifically from the Indie Game Dev community

296
00:17:35,033 --> 00:17:39,937
is that everyone's really nice and everyone's constantly looking for opportunities to collaborate

297
00:17:39,937 --> 00:17:42,898
or help or inspire.

298
00:17:42,898 --> 00:17:43,519
So I think

299
00:17:44,199 --> 00:17:50,942
looking through roads to actually collaborate with other indie devs that might not be from our regions, might be a great opportunity.

300
00:17:50,942 --> 00:17:54,943
So that takes me to Twitchella. Twitchella is the event I was telling you about.

301
00:17:54,943 --> 00:17:59,605
Twitchella is a non-profit charity streaming fest that we organize from Panama.

302
00:17:59,605 --> 00:18:02,926
We do it at least two or three times a year.

303
00:18:02,926 --> 00:18:04,707
We raise funds that it has like...

304
00:18:05,772 --> 00:18:09,614
a couple of pillars that are actually what we want the event to succeed in.

305
00:18:09,614 --> 00:18:12,676
One of them, it's of course, the charity part of it.

306
00:18:12,676 --> 00:18:15,797
And we've been working with UNICEF for the past couple of years.

307
00:18:15,797 --> 00:18:18,879
So we raised most of our funds to help underprivileged children

308
00:18:18,879 --> 00:18:19,939
in our country, in our region.

309
00:18:21,001 --> 00:18:24,084
The other aspect of it is to actually be a platform

310
00:18:24,084 --> 00:18:25,565
for new content creators.

311
00:18:25,565 --> 00:18:28,048
Like we have different sizes of content creators

312
00:18:28,048 --> 00:18:32,112
but we've always trying to have a couple at least per day

313
00:18:32,112 --> 00:18:33,874
that are up and coming, that are just starting

314
00:18:33,874 --> 00:18:36,596
or have small audiences so that they can use the event

315
00:18:36,596 --> 00:18:38,738
and the platform and that networking

316
00:18:38,738 --> 00:18:42,082
to actually show their content to new audiences.

317
00:18:42,082 --> 00:18:44,985
And finally, create opportunities for

318
00:18:45,867 --> 00:18:49,253
education. This is one of the main things that I've always

319
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:52,478
trying to do. And we've had the opportunity, like I was saying,

320
00:18:52,478 --> 00:18:54,622
of collaborating beyond our borders and just knocking on

321
00:18:54,622 --> 00:18:56,044
doors and asking for help.

322
00:18:56,448 --> 00:18:59,629
And we've had a lot of panels where people have actually learned a lot.

323
00:18:59,629 --> 00:19:03,550
We've been we've had developed the video in Latin America panel.

324
00:19:03,550 --> 00:19:07,772
It's it was a talk between Jose Garcia, Ricardo Noriega and Jeff Cardenas.

325
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,893
Three of them have are developed developers from Latin America,

326
00:19:10,893 --> 00:19:12,494
from Panama and Colombia.

327
00:19:12,494 --> 00:19:16,655
So that gave a window for people to actually understand how they're working

328
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:19,736
from Latin America, what their struggles are,

329
00:19:19,736 --> 00:19:21,737
what they have learned and stuff like that.

330
00:19:21,737 --> 00:19:24,998
We've also had panels with Troy Baker talking about his career.

331
00:19:25,259 --> 00:19:30,982
Kat Gwenski talking about the audio design and composition. We've had Philip Guglielmo that

332
00:19:30,982 --> 00:19:36,946
worked in in Hayside in He Takes Two and A Way Out and he's now developing his own game and he was

333
00:19:36,946 --> 00:19:42,390
talking about how he got, how people get scholarships to study where he studied and places to

334
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:47,193
actually knock on doors to get new opportunities. Melissa of course, we have also had her in

335
00:19:47,193 --> 00:19:50,955
in the past couple of, in one of the last

336
00:19:51,967 --> 00:19:55,291
to each other to talk about her career and technical game design.

337
00:19:55,291 --> 00:19:58,595
So this is stuff that we are doing that I think actually help.

338
00:19:58,595 --> 00:20:03,622
But I think there's something that the wider industry can do to help as well.

339
00:20:03,622 --> 00:20:04,703
And that's.

340
00:20:06,395 --> 00:20:12,040
understanding how big of an audience and how great of an audience Latin America is for

341
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:17,144
Indy, not only because of the financial efforts that we have to go through.

342
00:20:17,144 --> 00:20:22,729
Not a lot of people can actually afford a $70 game. So like the price point of Indy games tend

343
00:20:22,729 --> 00:20:27,734
to be really appealing for people in our region. And also it's a big, it's a huge ass market. Like

344
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:32,198
I mean, I'm talking about 23 countries and like I was showing before about just.

345
00:20:33,003 --> 00:20:34,624
Talking about audiences on Twitch,

346
00:20:34,624 --> 00:20:35,925
it's like a big, big audience.

347
00:20:35,925 --> 00:20:38,266
So I think it's a great opportunity for indie games

348
00:20:38,266 --> 00:20:40,347
to market themselves in Latin America,

349
00:20:40,347 --> 00:20:42,207
something that's not actually happening,

350
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:46,369
and see them thrive and actually give also opportunities

351
00:20:46,369 --> 00:20:48,250
for people in our country to learn English

352
00:20:48,250 --> 00:20:51,271
through your games, to make friends through your games,

353
00:20:51,271 --> 00:20:54,433
and maybe even get inspired to develop their own games.

354
00:20:55,171 --> 00:20:59,115
And I think there's three things that can be done to actually move these forward

355
00:20:59,115 --> 00:21:00,476
or move the needle forward.

356
00:21:00,476 --> 00:21:05,001
One is find these windows of collaboration in the devs in Latin America.

357
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:14,005
There's a lot of communities I'm going to share in one of the last slides that you can actually go to unlock your doors and find ways to collaborate also finding communities.

358
00:21:14,005 --> 00:21:27,011
Again, those communities are going to be in one of the last slides, but, but a lot of people in those communities are looking for opportunities to help that in the Latin American industry to thrive so there's a good way to actually help and find our

359
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,972
games, like I was saying it's really hard.

360
00:21:29,865 --> 00:21:32,626
we battle and we struggle with visibility.

361
00:21:32,626 --> 00:21:35,547
But in these events, there's always a guy from Mexico

362
00:21:35,547 --> 00:21:40,249
or Chile or Uruguay trying his best with his English

363
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:42,650
learned through Final Fantasy to actually find opportunities

364
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,031
to collaborate and network.

365
00:21:44,031 --> 00:21:48,093
So let's just work together to not depend on GARRA alone.

366
00:21:48,093 --> 00:21:48,993
We do have GARRA.

367
00:21:48,993 --> 00:21:51,534
I think the resolve of the Latin American game industry

368
00:21:51,534 --> 00:21:52,255
is an actual thing.

369
00:21:52,255 --> 00:21:55,136
It's an industry that's thriving,

370
00:21:55,136 --> 00:21:58,537
even though it has all of those struggles.

371
00:21:58,537 --> 00:21:59,678
And just by picking a broom and...

372
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:04,348
and helping out, I think the industry is going long ways.

373
00:22:04,348 --> 00:22:06,389
But I think the industry as a whole

374
00:22:06,389 --> 00:22:09,631
can actually help us move the needle forward.

375
00:22:09,631 --> 00:22:11,453
So that's my talk.

376
00:22:11,453 --> 00:22:14,035
I don't know if anyone has any questions or comments.

377
00:22:14,035 --> 00:22:16,176
I do wanna share a couple of resources

378
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:19,559
while you think about any questions.

379
00:22:19,559 --> 00:22:23,622
But basically, it's this three small slides.

380
00:22:23,622 --> 00:22:25,683
The first one is, where are we?

381
00:22:25,683 --> 00:22:26,964
How can you find us?

382
00:22:26,964 --> 00:22:27,545
Most of our,

383
00:22:28,775 --> 00:22:31,178
of the communities based in Facebook groups.

384
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:33,621
So Facebook groups is a great way to start.

385
00:22:33,621 --> 00:22:37,105
Most of our industries actually market through WhatsApp

386
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,827
because it's the biggest social platform we have.

387
00:22:38,827 --> 00:22:39,428
But.

388
00:22:40,936 --> 00:22:44,560
And this is where I think there's a great opportunity to actually be on the lookout.

389
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:47,983
A lot of content creators are turning to TikTok in Latin America to share what

390
00:22:47,983 --> 00:22:52,208
they're doing on their Twitch channels and on their YouTube videos and stuff like that.

391
00:22:52,208 --> 00:22:55,311
So if you're looking for content creators and stuff, I think this might

392
00:22:55,311 --> 00:22:56,933
be the best way to look for them.

393
00:22:56,933 --> 00:23:00,917
And if you're looking for game devs, there's also a great way to look for them.

394
00:23:01,793 --> 00:23:04,576
These are other examples of video games in Latin America.

395
00:23:04,576 --> 00:23:06,558
Again, this is like a really, really, really,

396
00:23:06,558 --> 00:23:08,600
really, really specific list.

397
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,742
I just wanted to share some diversity,

398
00:23:10,742 --> 00:23:13,024
like with a 2.5 action adventure

399
00:23:13,024 --> 00:23:15,406
from Drakma Studios in Mexico called Candlelight.

400
00:23:15,406 --> 00:23:18,970
And we have puzzle platformers and tower defense games,

401
00:23:18,970 --> 00:23:21,612
fighting sims, fighting games, puzzle stealth games.

402
00:23:21,612 --> 00:23:22,533
Like there's a lot.

403
00:23:22,533 --> 00:23:25,075
So just go looking for us, especially in...

404
00:23:25,730 --> 00:23:27,971
in small events and look for communities.

405
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:31,514
We have communities like Indies that just had a talk yesterday.

406
00:23:31,514 --> 00:23:33,255
So you can look for that in the vault.

407
00:23:33,255 --> 00:23:34,376
Game Devs Max.

408
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:38,959
We have the game from Game Audio that has a talk tomorrow at 1030 a.m.

409
00:23:38,959 --> 00:23:40,380
DVJs Mexico is a big one.

410
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:43,602
Woman in Game X has a talk here, I think, at 4 p.m. on Thursday.

411
00:23:43,602 --> 00:23:46,924
I don't know if it's specifically them, but I know there's some people

412
00:23:46,924 --> 00:23:48,945
from the game, Woman in Game X.

413
00:23:49,826 --> 00:23:55,488
that are part of the talk. And finally, LightingX in Gaming, I think is huge. And they also have a

414
00:23:55,488 --> 00:24:00,911
talk Thursday, 10 a.m. And these are my socials. Just in case you want to follow, contact or

415
00:24:00,911 --> 00:24:08,734
follow, you can find me in Twitter and Instagram in both David Lucious or Twitch Lapa. And LWS,

416
00:24:08,734 --> 00:24:15,256
if you show, you can look for us on Twitch and talk and hang out. So, yeah, that's my talk.

417
00:24:15,256 --> 00:24:17,037
I don't know if anyone has any questions.

418
00:24:20,623 --> 00:24:23,704
I have a question, David.

419
00:24:23,704 --> 00:24:23,764
Yep.

420
00:24:23,764 --> 00:24:24,965
And a bit of comments, too.

421
00:24:24,965 --> 00:24:25,165
Thank you.

422
00:24:25,165 --> 00:24:28,807
My name is Daniel.

423
00:24:28,807 --> 00:24:29,707
I am a Puerto Rican.

424
00:24:29,707 --> 00:24:31,588
I was born and raised in New York.

425
00:24:33,259 --> 00:24:35,180
But over the last two years,

426
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:37,960
cultural representation in video games

427
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,581
has been the focal point of my work.

428
00:24:41,581 --> 00:24:42,841
As an outsider looking in,

429
00:24:42,841 --> 00:24:44,402
I may be a part of the diaspora,

430
00:24:44,402 --> 00:24:47,823
but I don't have the same experiences

431
00:24:47,823 --> 00:24:49,943
that all of my people have.

432
00:24:49,943 --> 00:24:53,844
And so, for somebody who wants to go indie,

433
00:24:53,844 --> 00:24:54,945
hopefully one day,

434
00:24:54,945 --> 00:25:00,206
what would your advice be for me?

435
00:25:00,206 --> 00:25:00,406
Yeah.

436
00:25:01,055 --> 00:25:07,518
I hope that I was a little bit clear. I think I think that, well, first of all, thank you for for being in the talk and having a question.

437
00:25:07,518 --> 00:25:20,444
I actually think, and this is something that I apply to what I do. And is, I think we sometimes underestimate the value of our, how we inject our DNA into everything.

438
00:25:20,444 --> 00:25:26,587
And so, the questions coming from Puerto Rico are coming from La Punta Argentina are really

439
00:25:27,047 --> 00:25:30,589
they're always injecting what they do to their to what they do.

440
00:25:30,589 --> 00:25:33,711
And I'm a big defender on that.

441
00:25:33,711 --> 00:25:38,875
Things don't have to represent everything you do every every time you do it.

442
00:25:38,875 --> 00:25:41,997
And what I mean by that is like I grew watching Spielberg.

443
00:25:41,997 --> 00:25:44,218
I love how Spielberg directed films.

444
00:25:44,218 --> 00:25:46,940
And I understand that I have a responsibility to maybe show people

445
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,760
through my films.

446
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,461
what a Colombian experience is, but I also have a lot of sensibility that comes from the movies

447
00:25:52,461 --> 00:25:57,903
that I watched. So my point of view, even though it might be westernized in some way,

448
00:25:57,903 --> 00:26:03,204
have been injected with my experience as a Colombian and living in Panama and all that stuff.

449
00:26:03,204 --> 00:26:08,685
So I think that the first thing that anyone in our region that has to do in any creative endeavor

450
00:26:08,685 --> 00:26:13,506
is just understand and appreciate how much of their identity they can actually inject in what

451
00:26:13,506 --> 00:26:17,747
they're doing, even though at a first glance it might not feel Latin enough.

452
00:26:17,807 --> 00:26:20,269
I don't know if that made any sense, but hope that helped.

453
00:26:20,269 --> 00:26:23,291
That actually really did help.

454
00:26:23,291 --> 00:26:24,893
Thank you very much. I appreciate it.

455
00:26:24,893 --> 00:26:25,393
No, thank you.

456
00:26:25,393 --> 00:26:28,816
Hi David, thank you so much for your talk.

457
00:26:28,816 --> 00:26:38,023
I'm working in the climate game space, and one of the things that we're finding is that

458
00:26:38,023 --> 00:26:43,407
we've known for a long time that the global south as a whole suffers from climate impacts

459
00:26:43,407 --> 00:26:45,409
far more than a lot of countries in the global north.

460
00:26:45,889 --> 00:26:54,953
Do you know, how do you see, if at all, the indie game scene in South America responding to that?

461
00:26:54,953 --> 00:26:58,334
Do you see them trying to tackle those kinds of issues in games?

462
00:26:58,334 --> 00:27:03,296
Are there any communities that are building up around that? Do people need funding, information?

463
00:27:03,296 --> 00:27:09,498
Do you know what the sort of needs or wants are related especially to climate change in games? Thank you.

464
00:27:09,498 --> 00:27:13,820
I'm not that- thank you. What's your name again? I'm sorry.

465
00:27:15,006 --> 00:27:17,607
Felix, thank you.

466
00:27:17,607 --> 00:27:17,827
OK.

467
00:27:17,827 --> 00:27:20,968
No, what I would say is I'm not that,

468
00:27:20,968 --> 00:27:25,569
I haven't researched at all on that aspect of games.

469
00:27:25,569 --> 00:27:27,310
I do, there's a lot of initiatives,

470
00:27:27,310 --> 00:27:30,711
specifically from Brazil and Argentina and Mexico,

471
00:27:30,711 --> 00:27:35,012
of young people initiatives to actually help

472
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:36,113
with climate change.

473
00:27:36,113 --> 00:27:39,674
I do know most of the initiatives that

474
00:27:39,674 --> 00:27:43,075
are actually supported by governmental funds in a region

475
00:27:43,075 --> 00:27:44,455
tend to be academic.

476
00:27:45,111 --> 00:27:48,254
or related to an initiative from the government.

477
00:27:48,254 --> 00:27:50,636
So I'm sure that there's points of contact

478
00:27:50,636 --> 00:27:52,718
with the governments and their own initiatives

479
00:27:52,718 --> 00:27:57,102
to actually help out that you can actually find deaf teams

480
00:27:57,102 --> 00:27:59,985
and put them in contact with those government facilities

481
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,326
to see if there's opportunities

482
00:28:01,326 --> 00:28:03,108
for both of them to collaborate.

483
00:28:03,108 --> 00:28:05,350
Like for instance, in Panama, we,

484
00:28:06,231 --> 00:28:17,465
We have a lot of stuff that we're doing because of the canal, the canal basically destroyed part of the forest here in Panama. So they're constantly at the Canal of Panama, they're looking for ways to actually help out and spread the word.

485
00:28:17,465 --> 00:28:23,312
So they've actually contacted animators and and and programmers in Panama to develop.

486
00:28:24,747 --> 00:28:30,631
apps and games, not only to teach people about the story of the Panama Canal, but also like

487
00:28:30,631 --> 00:28:35,134
do some reparations on the story of like minorities and people of color in Panama.

488
00:28:35,134 --> 00:28:40,497
And there's also a part of it that states about the conservation.

489
00:28:41,257 --> 00:28:44,639
how to conserve better some of the found on Florida that had

490
00:28:44,639 --> 00:28:48,680
been lost through the canal.

491
00:28:48,680 --> 00:28:52,002
So I think that those might be a good place to start,

492
00:28:52,002 --> 00:28:56,324
just like contacting the initiatives of the government

493
00:28:56,324 --> 00:28:57,784
and maybe dev teams from those countries

494
00:28:57,784 --> 00:29:00,566
and find ways for them to collaborate and create stuff.

495
00:29:00,566 --> 00:29:01,186
That's amazing.

496
00:29:01,186 --> 00:29:01,606
Thank you so much.

497
00:29:01,606 --> 00:29:01,846
No, thank you.

498
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:02,667
We've got time for one more question.

499
00:29:04,991 --> 00:29:08,553
Buenas tardes, my name is Sebastian Rivera.

500
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:12,676
I'm Colombian, born and raised in the United States, but,

501
00:29:12,676 --> 00:29:17,019
saludos, but, you know, I come from Tulua, a little small town.

502
00:29:17,019 --> 00:29:19,380
And I remember, you know, announcing to my family

503
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:20,601
of choosing this career.

504
00:29:20,601 --> 00:29:23,963
It's a very niche market in Latin America and South America.

505
00:29:23,963 --> 00:29:26,625
Not many people know about this, but it's something

506
00:29:26,625 --> 00:29:29,147
that really sees that a lot of Latin Americans,

507
00:29:29,147 --> 00:29:31,188
they want to be part of this market.

508
00:29:31,772 --> 00:29:33,392
And I think you discussed it a little bit

509
00:29:33,392 --> 00:29:36,774
about these opportunities are not truly there.

510
00:29:36,774 --> 00:29:40,456
Any words of advice of like how

511
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:44,438
to let this business grow inside it?

512
00:29:44,438 --> 00:29:47,740
Not only let it be only for indie developers,

513
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:49,381
where it's only one person or two people,

514
00:29:49,381 --> 00:29:53,503
but let this market grow as for European markets,

515
00:29:53,503 --> 00:29:55,244
Asian markets, American markets,

516
00:29:55,244 --> 00:29:56,725
where we could probably see one day

517
00:29:56,725 --> 00:29:59,847
that there might be a Latin America video game company

518
00:29:59,847 --> 00:30:00,767
that stretches out.

519
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,716
I mean, I think...

520
00:30:05,373 --> 00:30:13,379
I think it I don't want to be like repetitive, what I said before, but I really think it goes down to collaboration between our borders.

521
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:19,824
Latin America has always thrived in understanding that it's one of Latin America.

522
00:30:19,824 --> 00:30:29,411
Most of the biggest initiatives both in music and film and everything that has gone through art in a region have gone from collaboration between countries.

523
00:30:29,411 --> 00:30:35,215
I know there's a lot of communities, for instance in the one of the last slides like in in these slides.

524
00:30:35,215 --> 00:30:38,862
that tend to collaborate between different countries.

525
00:30:38,862 --> 00:30:41,667
And I think before we think about being

526
00:30:41,667 --> 00:30:44,672
seen outside of our region, we just

527
00:30:44,672 --> 00:30:46,515
have to understand that as.

528
00:30:47,517 --> 00:30:50,518
has happened before with different initiatives

529
00:30:50,518 --> 00:30:52,519
in a region, we have to work together

530
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:55,160
and maybe create a coalition of game devs

531
00:30:55,160 --> 00:30:56,381
from different countries.

532
00:30:56,381 --> 00:30:59,682
Like right now, I think that Mexico, Argentina, and Colombia

533
00:30:59,682 --> 00:31:02,403
have their own actual finance groups,

534
00:31:02,403 --> 00:31:06,025
governmental groups that are battling for opportunities

535
00:31:06,025 --> 00:31:07,905
in the game industry department.

536
00:31:07,905 --> 00:31:10,406
But I think that the only way for the region

537
00:31:10,406 --> 00:31:13,127
to understand that industry as an industry

538
00:31:13,127 --> 00:31:14,928
is for it to grow from within.

539
00:31:14,928 --> 00:31:17,249
And I only think that happens through collaboration.

540
00:31:18,515 --> 00:31:23,958
I also think that having an indie industry, it's almost like, I don't know if this is a term that's

541
00:31:23,958 --> 00:31:28,400
going to translate well, but la cantera, like having the people in the bench, when you have

542
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:33,242
like a soccer team, you have a couple of people in the bench. I think the way that bench works

543
00:31:33,242 --> 00:31:38,144
is that it keeps training those people to actually eventually replace this. And what has happened

544
00:31:38,144 --> 00:31:43,987
with the indie game development community is that when one of the games really shines, like for

545
00:31:43,987 --> 00:31:48,129
instance, Gryffindor, and I had a discussion with Jeff the last time we spoke,

546
00:31:48,489 --> 00:31:56,732
What happens is then headhunters start looking for the talent within that game and they take them to their bigger teams in Europe, States or Asia.

547
00:31:56,732 --> 00:32:02,133
So actually having an indie dev community and actually thriving there, I think it's a great starting point.

548
00:32:02,133 --> 00:32:06,115
It's like when you shoot short films to eventually get finance for their feature film.

549
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:21,004
So even though I understand that eventually the goal would be to grow to a point where we can actually talk beyond Latin America, I do think that we have to first collaborate within, grow within, stamp something in the ground, and then from there go on.

550
00:32:21,004 --> 00:32:24,367
And I think that the sky's the limit, basically.

551
00:32:24,367 --> 00:32:26,528
Thank you very much.

552
00:32:26,528 --> 00:32:27,329
Thank you.

553
00:32:27,329 --> 00:32:28,810
Gusto, Celestin.
