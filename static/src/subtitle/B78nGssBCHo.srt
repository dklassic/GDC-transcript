1
00:00:06,335 --> 00:00:07,615
We're going to get started here.

2
00:00:07,735 --> 00:00:08,995
Thank you for coming to our talk.

3
00:00:09,835 --> 00:00:12,136
They've asked us to remind you to turn off

4
00:00:12,176 --> 00:00:13,356
all of your noise-making devices.

5
00:00:14,376 --> 00:00:18,897
And if you could, at the end, fill out your session reviews,

6
00:00:18,957 --> 00:00:20,278
that would be great feedback for us.

7
00:00:20,538 --> 00:00:20,818
Thank you.

8
00:00:23,178 --> 00:00:24,678
Today, we're here to tell you how

9
00:00:24,719 --> 00:00:26,979
we built a real-life magic school bus that

10
00:00:27,019 --> 00:00:29,559
brought Mars down to Earth for middle school students.

11
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:32,040
First, I want to take you back to the year 1997.

12
00:00:34,052 --> 00:00:35,912
Think about where you were in the year 1997.

13
00:00:36,413 --> 00:00:38,634
That was about 20 years ago.

14
00:00:39,294 --> 00:00:42,095
In Mars terms, this was the year that the Pathfinder

15
00:00:42,155 --> 00:00:43,896
rover landed on Mars.

16
00:00:45,056 --> 00:00:48,138
In middle school terms, well, this is our friend Tanya.

17
00:00:48,298 --> 00:00:51,479
And in middle school, she was obsessed with animals.

18
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,701
She would spend every afternoon in her backyard with

19
00:00:54,741 --> 00:00:58,723
her camera, photographing the animals and her garden that

20
00:00:58,743 --> 00:00:59,083
were there.

21
00:00:59,814 --> 00:01:01,155
and telling stories.

22
00:01:01,276 --> 00:01:04,658
And her all-time hero at this time was her history teacher,

23
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:05,739
Miss A.

24
00:01:06,940 --> 00:01:10,343
Fast forward a couple of years, and Tanya's 10th grade science

25
00:01:10,383 --> 00:01:13,086
class gets to participate in the Mars Millennium

26
00:01:13,126 --> 00:01:14,067
Project of the year 2030.

27
00:01:14,227 --> 00:01:18,350
And Tanya gets to work directly with some experts from

28
00:01:18,771 --> 00:01:21,993
NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory to design what it

29
00:01:22,013 --> 00:01:24,796
would be like for a human colony to travel to Mars.

30
00:01:25,338 --> 00:01:31,202
They're starting to figure out what would it be like for humans to live on Mars as a design challenge.

31
00:01:31,382 --> 00:01:36,025
And she's thinking for the very first time, what do people need to survive on Mars?

32
00:01:36,486 --> 00:01:38,167
How is it different from here on Earth?

33
00:01:38,947 --> 00:01:41,529
We can't breathe the air, but could we build a city there?

34
00:01:42,110 --> 00:01:46,012
What's it like? And how do we know the answer to all those questions?

35
00:01:46,813 --> 00:01:52,016
She felt a bit like an explorer about to plan a trip to a new place that she'd never been.

36
00:01:53,657 --> 00:01:55,959
And that was the day that Tanya became curious.

37
00:01:56,540 --> 00:02:01,043
And this curiosity sparked her lasting tenacity that guided

38
00:02:01,103 --> 00:02:04,666
her all the way through a PhD in Martian geology.

39
00:02:05,927 --> 00:02:09,930
And today, Tanya's a planetary scientist at Arizona State

40
00:02:10,010 --> 00:02:14,073
University, and she's been a part of the Curiosity rover

41
00:02:14,173 --> 00:02:17,656
operations team that provide daily instructions to pilot

42
00:02:17,716 --> 00:02:18,777
the rover on Mars.

43
00:02:20,154 --> 00:02:25,800
And there's something that Tanya's story has in common with many, many others in her field.

44
00:02:26,261 --> 00:02:32,968
And this is this clear turning point where science went from this abstract thing of the world of adults

45
00:02:33,328 --> 00:02:36,511
to something that became meaningful to her in her own life.

46
00:02:39,065 --> 00:02:44,947
While you and I might take for granted having access to great teachers and science experiences,

47
00:02:45,208 --> 00:02:51,130
and we're all ultimately here at a game development conference because we had that type of access,

48
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:57,493
unfortunately not every student has access to experiences like Tanya had to see that

49
00:02:57,553 --> 00:02:57,913
spark.

50
00:02:58,454 --> 00:03:03,816
In fact, schools in America are really falling behind on STEM, and that's science, technology,

51
00:03:04,096 --> 00:03:05,037
engineering, and math.

52
00:03:05,545 --> 00:03:08,347
And as a result, we're closing doors on students

53
00:03:08,427 --> 00:03:10,749
to these promising career opportunities

54
00:03:11,129 --> 00:03:12,370
that they could have ahead.

55
00:03:12,991 --> 00:03:15,533
And don't take my word for it.

56
00:03:16,013 --> 00:03:20,197
We asked this student to tell us about her least favorite class.

57
00:03:22,179 --> 00:03:22,539
Science.

58
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:27,783
Because for science, we don't really do any experiments.

59
00:03:28,284 --> 00:03:31,807
She just makes us write notes and stuff from the things.

60
00:03:32,109 --> 00:03:35,391
The only time you ever get to do experiments, you never get to really do anything fun.

61
00:03:37,192 --> 00:03:38,833
Science is prescriptive.

62
00:03:40,074 --> 00:03:47,239
Students are told what to do and they don't have permission to explore and experiment and figure it out on their own.

63
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:54,524
So it's hard to blame the student for not wanting to take science home with her and put the extra mile into that,

64
00:03:54,644 --> 00:04:01,788
that she might really need to develop a deep interest in it and like a lasting interest in making this her career.

65
00:04:02,703 --> 00:04:06,365
So the Verizon Foundation posed this question of,

66
00:04:07,025 --> 00:04:09,806
how might we allow middle schoolers to step firsthand

67
00:04:09,886 --> 00:04:13,267
into the shoes of an explorer to spark their curiosity

68
00:04:13,507 --> 00:04:14,928
in ongoing STEM learning?

69
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:19,129
And their aspiration is to reach a large number of students

70
00:04:19,469 --> 00:04:21,950
who currently don't have this type of access.

71
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:24,771
And the reality is that most of these students

72
00:04:24,951 --> 00:04:26,792
are students of color and girls.

73
00:04:27,512 --> 00:04:31,853
And Verizon Foundation came to IDEO to pose this question.

74
00:04:32,491 --> 00:04:37,554
IDEO, this is our company, we're a global human-centered design firm and we like these

75
00:04:37,634 --> 00:04:43,757
big sticky challenges and we look for ways to help other companies navigate through them.

76
00:04:44,438 --> 00:04:51,762
And so that meant that we had a team come on to envision how we might address this question.

77
00:04:52,282 --> 00:04:56,064
And this team developed the rendering that you see here.

78
00:04:56,524 --> 00:04:57,885
This was a team at IDEO.

79
00:04:58,786 --> 00:05:01,547
In the end, we'll show you what this has become.

80
00:05:02,079 --> 00:05:06,123
the reality of this real-world magic school bus that we built.

81
00:05:06,423 --> 00:05:11,087
And here it's envisioning a bus meets spaceship interactive field trip,

82
00:05:11,688 --> 00:05:17,753
goes to schools for 45-minute classroom sessions, reaches about five per day,

83
00:05:18,433 --> 00:05:21,916
and students will come on, pick up a tablet,

84
00:05:22,197 --> 00:05:25,079
and learn how to engineer rovers that they get to deploy

85
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:29,983
on the Martian landscape in order to look for evidence.

86
00:05:30,515 --> 00:05:35,877
Kind of early provocations here on how we might balance individual versus group,

87
00:05:36,337 --> 00:05:38,278
collaborative versus competitive play.

88
00:05:38,618 --> 00:05:42,740
It's really just a vision at this point and we had to figure out how to make it real.

89
00:05:43,620 --> 00:05:46,842
To do that, we needed a highly interdisciplinary team.

90
00:05:47,502 --> 00:05:50,984
So by way of introduction, I'm Kate and I'm a software designer.

91
00:05:51,564 --> 00:05:53,345
And I'm Peter. I'm a game designer.

92
00:05:54,125 --> 00:05:56,166
And when we were brought on to this project,

93
00:05:56,446 --> 00:05:58,867
we brought together this multidisciplinary team.

94
00:05:59,422 --> 00:06:01,162
And we were all really excited to work together

95
00:06:01,242 --> 00:06:03,283
because everyone brought certain superpowers

96
00:06:03,523 --> 00:06:04,984
from their diverse disciplines.

97
00:06:05,904 --> 00:06:08,985
It was really important for us to deal

98
00:06:09,065 --> 00:06:11,846
with the massive number of unknowns up front.

99
00:06:12,466 --> 00:06:14,567
Namely, we'd never built a game together before

100
00:06:14,787 --> 00:06:17,188
because IDEO isn't only a game design studio.

101
00:06:17,268 --> 00:06:19,649
We do a lot of work from product design

102
00:06:19,769 --> 00:06:22,249
to marketing strategy and game design.

103
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,790
So we had to figure out how to work together

104
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:28,152
and it was important that we use our different skill sets.

105
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,170
to inform the way we go about designing our game.

106
00:06:31,830 --> 00:06:33,830
We had our in-house education expertise,

107
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:37,291
as well as a mainstay of IDEO projects design research,

108
00:06:37,911 --> 00:06:41,132
along with a number of skills that we traditionally associate

109
00:06:41,172 --> 00:06:44,193
with game design, like software and interaction design.

110
00:06:45,533 --> 00:06:47,834
And it was super important to get this right the first time

111
00:06:48,034 --> 00:06:50,414
because we only had 13 weeks and five people

112
00:06:50,454 --> 00:06:51,935
to actually build and design this game.

113
00:06:54,055 --> 00:06:56,376
So you can, well that's a laser pointer.

114
00:06:56,786 --> 00:07:00,187
You can imagine that we learned a lot of hard lessons along the way.

115
00:07:00,908 --> 00:07:03,248
And so we've broken those down into four key lessons,

116
00:07:03,429 --> 00:07:06,290
which are comprised of a core concept and four takeaways

117
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,671
that we hope you can take back to your design processes

118
00:07:09,051 --> 00:07:10,711
to inspire future design in this area.

119
00:07:12,252 --> 00:07:15,553
So the first of these is that we actually had to figure out

120
00:07:16,033 --> 00:07:17,254
what game we were going to design.

121
00:07:17,454 --> 00:07:19,455
We didn't really know what the core mechanic was.

122
00:07:19,855 --> 00:07:22,616
We didn't know the specifics of the game itself.

123
00:07:23,356 --> 00:07:26,057
At this point in time, the experience looked like this.

124
00:07:26,628 --> 00:07:27,929
It was very much a blank slate.

125
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:31,191
So we had to figure out a number of things.

126
00:07:31,332 --> 00:07:32,672
And there were a couple of things we knew.

127
00:07:33,193 --> 00:07:34,434
We knew that there would be rovers

128
00:07:34,874 --> 00:07:36,635
and that you would play the game on tablets.

129
00:07:37,135 --> 00:07:38,977
But how did you communicate with your rover?

130
00:07:38,997 --> 00:07:40,397
I mean, kids like texting.

131
00:07:40,538 --> 00:07:41,138
We should do that.

132
00:07:41,178 --> 00:07:41,778
That seems fun.

133
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:44,960
And what are you doing with rovers on Mars?

134
00:07:45,241 --> 00:07:47,202
Usually we're looking at geological evidence

135
00:07:47,322 --> 00:07:48,843
or we're searching for evidence of life.

136
00:07:49,303 --> 00:07:51,425
But do we want to tell kids that they're actually

137
00:07:51,725 --> 00:07:52,746
finding evidence of life?

138
00:07:52,886 --> 00:07:54,146
Because we don't know that that's true.

139
00:07:55,862 --> 00:07:58,023
And finally, when you send a rover to Mars,

140
00:07:58,303 --> 00:07:59,443
you can't change it anymore.

141
00:07:59,603 --> 00:07:59,963
That's it.

142
00:08:00,543 --> 00:08:02,904
So this doesn't really lead to an iterative approach,

143
00:08:03,104 --> 00:08:05,064
which is something that we wanted to emphasize

144
00:08:05,124 --> 00:08:06,484
because we were trying to teach engineering.

145
00:08:07,704 --> 00:08:09,705
So to start figuring some of these questions out,

146
00:08:09,865 --> 00:08:11,445
we decided to create a prototype.

147
00:08:12,065 --> 00:08:16,166
This was a card game with a 3D digital map of Mars

148
00:08:16,226 --> 00:08:17,586
that kids could drive rovers around.

149
00:08:18,066 --> 00:08:19,167
And then there were some parts that

150
00:08:19,207 --> 00:08:22,067
had them building structures and solving logic problems.

151
00:08:23,112 --> 00:08:26,134
We were testing a number of things,

152
00:08:26,374 --> 00:08:29,616
from can the kids understand these really advanced science

153
00:08:29,656 --> 00:08:32,578
concepts, to do they even think Mars is cool?

154
00:08:32,638 --> 00:08:34,379
Is that something they even want to engage with?

155
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:36,980
And we were also looking at a number of different

156
00:08:37,040 --> 00:08:39,782
interactions, trying to see what they gravitated towards.

157
00:08:40,102 --> 00:08:41,983
Did they like physical interactions, or did they like

158
00:08:42,163 --> 00:08:43,084
working on a screen?

159
00:08:44,404 --> 00:08:47,626
So at the end of the playtest, which was the first Friday of

160
00:08:47,686 --> 00:08:49,027
our first week as a team together.

161
00:08:49,663 --> 00:08:52,004
We asked them, what did you learn?

162
00:08:52,144 --> 00:08:53,745
And we heard a lot of really great things.

163
00:08:54,525 --> 00:08:57,066
We heard, oh, I learned that we send rovers to Mars

164
00:08:57,306 --> 00:08:58,486
because we can't breathe the air.

165
00:08:59,427 --> 00:09:01,448
And when we're talking about aliens,

166
00:09:01,788 --> 00:09:03,008
or sorry, the search for life,

167
00:09:03,088 --> 00:09:04,449
we're not talking about aliens.

168
00:09:04,749 --> 00:09:06,030
We're actually talking about microbes.

169
00:09:06,510 --> 00:09:08,331
And these are great things to hear from middle schoolers.

170
00:09:08,911 --> 00:09:13,012
We also heard that the purple section of Mars has ice flow,

171
00:09:13,053 --> 00:09:14,533
which means there might be liquid water.

172
00:09:15,494 --> 00:09:16,994
I don't know if you've ever looked at a map of Mars,

173
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:18,215
but there's no purple section.

174
00:09:19,271 --> 00:09:21,852
We had split Mars into four quadrants and color coded them

175
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,952
so that we could better facilitate

176
00:09:24,012 --> 00:09:24,972
a certain kind of gameplay.

177
00:09:25,512 --> 00:09:27,753
But we also told kids that this was an educational game.

178
00:09:28,213 --> 00:09:29,933
So why can't there be a purple section of Mars?

179
00:09:29,974 --> 00:09:31,134
The adults are telling me there is.

180
00:09:32,054 --> 00:09:34,335
So this leads us to our first takeaway

181
00:09:34,775 --> 00:09:36,395
that your mechanics can misinstruct.

182
00:09:36,995 --> 00:09:39,256
When we design games, we're abstracting reality

183
00:09:39,476 --> 00:09:40,936
to build a bridge from where players are

184
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:42,376
to where we want them to be.

185
00:09:42,917 --> 00:09:45,477
This is super important to make your gameplay intelligible.

186
00:09:46,056 --> 00:09:49,277
But that bridge that you built can just as easily obfuscate

187
00:09:49,317 --> 00:09:51,217
the truth that underlies your mechanics.

188
00:09:51,657 --> 00:09:53,818
And in the end, it's that truth that you're trying to teach.

189
00:09:55,318 --> 00:09:56,838
And so for our first core concept,

190
00:09:57,778 --> 00:10:01,379
these represent key pivotal realizations in our thinking

191
00:10:01,419 --> 00:10:04,120
that we were able to integrate into our design process.

192
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:05,700
So the first one we're going to look at

193
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,360
is contrasting two kinds of testing.

194
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,501
Because this first realization that the way we design

195
00:10:10,541 --> 00:10:13,102
our game influences what we're teaching,

196
00:10:13,528 --> 00:10:17,530
was really important to get right up front very early on in the design process.

197
00:10:18,211 --> 00:10:22,113
So the two kinds of testing that we're going to look at, testing to validate and testing

198
00:10:22,153 --> 00:10:28,076
to learn, are emblematic of these different kinds of learning that we could have gone

199
00:10:28,416 --> 00:10:28,656
through.

200
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:36,780
So we could have been designing for a core audience, people that we knew what they wanted

201
00:10:36,820 --> 00:10:37,420
for the most part.

202
00:10:38,501 --> 00:10:40,102
As it was, we actually challenged ourselves.

203
00:10:40,616 --> 00:10:44,099
to test with a few extreme users, people who have really strong opinions

204
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:45,961
and who will give us strong reactions.

205
00:10:46,641 --> 00:10:48,663
Core users tend to give more nuanced reactions

206
00:10:48,703 --> 00:10:50,165
because they're already being designed for.

207
00:10:51,626 --> 00:10:53,227
We also could have tested late in development

208
00:10:53,628 --> 00:10:55,049
or with high investment prototypes.

209
00:10:55,449 --> 00:10:57,671
But this is really obvious to your players.

210
00:10:57,711 --> 00:10:59,473
They can see that you've put time and effort

211
00:10:59,593 --> 00:11:01,114
into what you're showing them.

212
00:11:02,035 --> 00:11:05,258
As it was, we showed them early prototypes,

213
00:11:05,278 --> 00:11:07,520
things that we quite literally spent a day developing.

214
00:11:08,405 --> 00:11:10,666
And this allowed them the freedom to tell us,

215
00:11:10,786 --> 00:11:13,228
and believe me, they did, that our game was pretty bad.

216
00:11:15,329 --> 00:11:17,891
What this means is that the later in development you test,

217
00:11:18,011 --> 00:11:21,053
the less changes that you can enact in your design.

218
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:24,055
So you end up tweaking your design as you get further along.

219
00:11:24,595 --> 00:11:26,476
Because we were testing on the first Friday,

220
00:11:26,616 --> 00:11:29,598
and then every two weeks subsequently in our design process,

221
00:11:30,059 --> 00:11:31,840
we were actually able to completely change course,

222
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,781
throwing out most of our first two prototypes.

223
00:11:36,095 --> 00:11:40,517
Testing later in design and only being able to change your designs a little bit means

224
00:11:40,577 --> 00:11:44,819
that you're reinforcing your biases by sending what you designed out into the world.

225
00:11:45,580 --> 00:11:50,242
Because this game had really specific goals and a very specific audience, we wanted to

226
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:51,483
make sure we were hitting those marks.

227
00:11:51,983 --> 00:11:55,825
And so because we were testing early and we were able to just completely change our design

228
00:11:55,845 --> 00:12:00,368
based on what we heard, we were able to change course to meet needs that weren't even identified

229
00:12:00,408 --> 00:12:01,368
in the first two prototypes.

230
00:12:02,584 --> 00:12:07,886
One of these is that we actually can't rely on a high level of digital literacy in this particular audience.

231
00:12:08,466 --> 00:12:12,847
As video game designers, we kind of rely on that literacy when we're putting a game out into the world,

232
00:12:12,907 --> 00:12:16,068
but with these kids, some of them might not have ever picked up an iPad before.

233
00:12:17,628 --> 00:12:23,030
We also saw the solution in this first prototype, that kids are actually really comfortable with working with their hands,

234
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:27,991
and so we took this as a sign that we could use physical literacy and physical metaphors

235
00:12:28,392 --> 00:12:30,332
to compensate for a lack of digital literacy.

236
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:36,468
So we scrapped our first prototype and designed a new mechanic around drawing lines.

237
00:12:36,749 --> 00:12:37,829
This is how you drive your rover.

238
00:12:38,029 --> 00:12:40,449
And this is something that every kid has done since they were very little.

239
00:12:41,090 --> 00:12:46,031
And if you remember Tanya from the intro, well, we brought her in as an expert to infuse

240
00:12:46,071 --> 00:12:50,732
this mechanic with actual science and actual information about how rovers are driven on

241
00:12:50,752 --> 00:12:51,032
Mars.

242
00:12:51,572 --> 00:12:56,473
She was the perfect inspiration for this project because the experience she had is so emblematic

243
00:12:56,513 --> 00:12:57,913
of what we want to create in students.

244
00:12:58,752 --> 00:13:02,452
But her expertise also lent the deep science knowledge

245
00:13:02,472 --> 00:13:04,393
that we wanted to impart to kids as well.

246
00:13:06,093 --> 00:13:07,593
So we then play tested this again.

247
00:13:07,833 --> 00:13:10,914
We used thumbtacks, string, and some cardboard.

248
00:13:11,434 --> 00:13:13,075
And we mostly made up the rules on the spot

249
00:13:13,155 --> 00:13:14,375
with the kids in the room.

250
00:13:14,935 --> 00:13:16,275
And we found that we could see them

251
00:13:16,415 --> 00:13:18,736
gravitating towards the interactions

252
00:13:18,776 --> 00:13:20,276
that they really found compelling.

253
00:13:22,837 --> 00:13:25,477
When we showed this to teachers, we asked them,

254
00:13:25,897 --> 00:13:27,058
what do you want us to design?

255
00:13:27,138 --> 00:13:28,218
Who do you want us to design for?

256
00:13:28,786 --> 00:13:30,886
And they said to design for the kids that need it the most,

257
00:13:31,546 --> 00:13:33,207
but don't leave out the kids poised to excel.

258
00:13:34,027 --> 00:13:36,727
And so it'd be easy to be like, oh, great, so just design

259
00:13:36,767 --> 00:13:37,268
for everybody.

260
00:13:38,068 --> 00:13:40,148
But we actually took this to mean something very specific.

261
00:13:40,288 --> 00:13:42,509
It meant that we had to start at zero

262
00:13:42,809 --> 00:13:45,529
and introduce the idea of Mars, and rovers,

263
00:13:45,789 --> 00:13:48,730
and why we send them there, and the importance of the search

264
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:51,930
for life in the universe, and build to a level of complexity

265
00:13:51,950 --> 00:13:54,051
where kids are grappling with these advanced engineering

266
00:13:54,071 --> 00:13:57,972
concepts as they're ready to encounter those ideas.

267
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:10,806
So when we talk about some students who may be ahead or behind, what that means is we're designing for a 6th through 8th grade audience.

268
00:14:11,286 --> 00:14:15,409
In practice, their learning levels range from about 4th grade through 10th grade.

269
00:14:15,889 --> 00:14:21,974
So to give you some real stories behind those extremes, at the 10th grade seeming level,

270
00:14:22,014 --> 00:14:27,378
we had an 8th grader who was already obsessed with computer programming and math and science,

271
00:14:27,538 --> 00:14:28,259
and he showed us...

272
00:14:29,114 --> 00:14:34,135
pictures of the Stormtrooper homemade Halloween costume that he had, which was accompanied

273
00:14:34,195 --> 00:14:38,197
by a flamethrower constructed out of a barbecue lighter and cardboard.

274
00:14:38,977 --> 00:14:39,577
Amazing.

275
00:14:39,857 --> 00:14:46,340
And on the other end, this was a student who had just come over to America from Portugal

276
00:14:46,460 --> 00:14:48,321
and he couldn't read or write English.

277
00:14:48,701 --> 00:14:55,623
So although he may have been normal in the learning curve, he was not able to act normally

278
00:14:55,703 --> 00:14:56,504
in a classroom.

279
00:14:57,564 --> 00:14:57,704
So.

280
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:01,999
We wanted to figure out how to serve both ends equally well.

281
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,920
And where we were at this time in the experience

282
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:09,341
was that we had resolved this very essential game

283
00:15:09,381 --> 00:15:12,622
mechanic of being able to draw a line to navigate

284
00:15:12,662 --> 00:15:13,782
your rover on Mars.

285
00:15:14,502 --> 00:15:18,083
And in doing so, the battery meter

286
00:15:18,123 --> 00:15:20,784
would go down according to the type of terrain

287
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:22,464
that you were going over, forcing

288
00:15:22,484 --> 00:15:24,805
you to have to choose the right set of wheels

289
00:15:25,265 --> 00:15:27,625
in the engineering loop for your rover.

290
00:15:28,686 --> 00:15:33,110
So we needed to figure out, OK, we've got all these students playing this game on Mars,

291
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,891
but how do they actually get to Mars?

292
00:15:35,331 --> 00:15:40,075
How do we take them from their classrooms all the way to feeling immersed

293
00:15:40,375 --> 00:15:42,437
and like they're really on the red planet?

294
00:15:43,118 --> 00:15:46,000
We decided we would do this with a video sequence

295
00:15:46,380 --> 00:15:48,822
that will initiate their launch into space.

296
00:15:49,282 --> 00:15:51,124
And so here in our second play test,

297
00:15:51,524 --> 00:15:55,868
we are prototyping storyboards and voice actors and...

298
00:15:56,458 --> 00:15:59,361
the type of narrative that we might use to take them there.

299
00:16:00,302 --> 00:16:04,866
We had so many things that we wanted to learn in this play test that we didn't

300
00:16:05,186 --> 00:16:08,850
have as much time to be really thoughtful about how we set up the session.

301
00:16:08,970 --> 00:16:11,472
So we went with what we thought would be a nice,

302
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:15,215
familiar setup to allow students to really express their opinions.

303
00:16:15,656 --> 00:16:17,938
And you can see we've laid it out just like a classroom.

304
00:16:17,998 --> 00:16:21,021
So there's essentially a teacher and a bunch of students.

305
00:16:21,873 --> 00:16:27,094
We had also found in our first play test that when we were asking students to verbally give

306
00:16:27,174 --> 00:16:31,735
us feedback, not everyone was comfortable with that, so we added a written evaluation

307
00:16:31,795 --> 00:16:32,595
to this as well.

308
00:16:33,776 --> 00:16:39,097
Not only did we leave out the student who was just over from Portugal who couldn't either

309
00:16:39,117 --> 00:16:47,539
engage in the written or speaking as clearly, we had also set ourselves up for sabotage.

310
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:52,161
This student had aloud given us a 10 out of 10, and on paper,

311
00:16:52,321 --> 00:16:56,443
given us a negative 10 out of 10, which cancels out to 0.

312
00:16:56,503 --> 00:17:00,584
So it made it very hard for us to get good feedback.

313
00:17:00,764 --> 00:17:03,525
And while we could have said, oh, yeah, we just

314
00:17:03,765 --> 00:17:06,706
didn't get the right students in, no, that was not the case.

315
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,146
The students were doing their job.

316
00:17:08,206 --> 00:17:09,347
They're the experts here.

317
00:17:09,847 --> 00:17:12,748
We had made a fundamental flaw, and that

318
00:17:13,028 --> 00:17:15,909
was in recreating the classroom setup.

319
00:17:16,585 --> 00:17:19,647
We had failed to connect with students at their level.

320
00:17:20,188 --> 00:17:24,011
We had walked in as a fairly poorly trained substitute

321
00:17:24,071 --> 00:17:29,475
teachers and were trying to extract things from them as

322
00:17:29,855 --> 00:17:31,857
even the very best of teachers would have a

323
00:17:32,097 --> 00:17:33,258
challenging time doing.

324
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,002
What we really needed was play posture.

325
00:17:38,582 --> 00:17:41,625
And when you look at the dog and the bear here, there's a

326
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:41,985
reason.

327
00:17:42,522 --> 00:17:45,943
That the bear is not signaling to the dog, I'm here to eat you.

328
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:50,584
He's asking to play and to act like a dog, really.

329
00:17:51,224 --> 00:17:54,805
And it turns out that play posture works well on kids.

330
00:17:55,385 --> 00:17:58,066
And this is quite different a philosophy

331
00:17:58,086 --> 00:17:59,206
than the classroom setup.

332
00:17:59,246 --> 00:18:01,547
So I want to break it down to a way

333
00:18:01,567 --> 00:18:03,207
that you could also apply to your work.

334
00:18:03,807 --> 00:18:07,208
So first step is to break the convention.

335
00:18:07,248 --> 00:18:09,889
Maybe sit backwards in your chair or on the floor.

336
00:18:11,212 --> 00:18:13,773
Start with warm-up activities, and this could look like

337
00:18:14,693 --> 00:18:16,854
having them ask you questions to show that you're

338
00:18:16,894 --> 00:18:20,055
participating, and you're here to create a dialogue, not a

339
00:18:20,115 --> 00:18:22,556
question-answer structured format.

340
00:18:23,156 --> 00:18:27,217
And you might follow their tangents, laugh at their jokes,

341
00:18:27,517 --> 00:18:29,838
and most of all, don't talk down to them.

342
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:36,120
We realized that this was making a tremendous difference

343
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:39,521
in our play tests going forward, and so why not also

344
00:18:39,581 --> 00:18:40,582
apply it to our game?

345
00:18:41,885 --> 00:18:47,567
To do this and to get inspired, we looked at what books and films are students watching

346
00:18:47,987 --> 00:18:51,229
that they really love and is really hitting the right tone with them.

347
00:18:51,809 --> 00:18:56,651
And we found universally that these books and films made kids the heroes.

348
00:18:56,711 --> 00:19:03,234
They put kids at the center of the plot line and ultimately, they were in a position where

349
00:19:03,314 --> 00:19:06,056
adults needed their help and not the other way around.

350
00:19:07,716 --> 00:19:08,997
And so, we...

351
00:19:09,684 --> 00:19:16,909
changed the narrative of our game quite intentionally so that instead of going to Mars on this educational

352
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:21,172
voyage just for the sake of collecting science, this is what they're told up front.

353
00:19:21,232 --> 00:19:25,895
But when they actually get there, they get a call in from NASA that NASA has lost their

354
00:19:25,975 --> 00:19:30,899
Curiosity rover and students are the only ones there to do anything about it.

355
00:19:30,939 --> 00:19:36,103
The students have to figure out how to work together to recover the rover that the adults

356
00:19:36,183 --> 00:19:36,463
lost.

357
00:19:37,055 --> 00:19:41,637
And so that is a really empowering moment where they get clicked in to realize,

358
00:19:41,837 --> 00:19:43,577
oh, this is taking place now.

359
00:19:43,597 --> 00:19:46,658
This is not people making me think about my future.

360
00:19:46,898 --> 00:19:48,578
I'm really here doing something.

361
00:19:49,299 --> 00:19:53,680
And that was also a really big part of what we're calling an emotional journey

362
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,760
or an emotional arc.

363
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:00,501
And this is another fundamental technique for helping connect with people

364
00:20:00,542 --> 00:20:02,982
at many different levels by creating.

365
00:20:03,819 --> 00:20:07,322
Something that, like the emotional undertone of the whole experience,

366
00:20:07,742 --> 00:20:12,405
we're bringing the group along through the whole story without having to rely on

367
00:20:14,227 --> 00:20:16,608
understanding of scientific detail to progress.

368
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:22,233
So, as you can probably sing the opening sequence of your favorite science fiction film,

369
00:20:22,833 --> 00:20:26,656
such as Star Wars, and that helps you remember and

370
00:20:27,797 --> 00:20:30,278
bring yourself back into the experience you just had.

371
00:20:30,907 --> 00:20:37,808
We worked with a real orchestra to craft a custom score that would help guide the emotional journey of this experience.

372
00:20:39,769 --> 00:20:43,870
In the best case scenario, we would have loved to bring in kids to tell us,

373
00:20:43,990 --> 00:20:47,950
what should we put in this game? What should we design? We're here to do anything that you want.

374
00:20:48,511 --> 00:20:53,312
We tried this once and a student advised us to suck the oxygen out of the bus.

375
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:56,893
Ultimately, that would be the most fun, most dramatic, most realistic.

376
00:20:57,553 --> 00:21:00,153
And it turns out kids love high stakes.

377
00:21:01,254 --> 00:21:07,176
Adults and kids have like very different perceptions of what they think would be, yeah, the right level of

378
00:21:08,296 --> 00:21:09,657
drama here. So

379
00:21:10,557 --> 00:21:12,458
we did not listen to them directly,

380
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:17,839
but we did look for what the underlying need was and we brought in Tanya once again to

381
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:23,141
help us infuse science into this. And to get quite specific here,

382
00:21:23,721 --> 00:21:30,023
Tanya taught us that in very recent science, although it was thought that Mars had a solid core,

383
00:21:30,854 --> 00:21:33,895
we are actually starting to believe that Mars may still have a liquid core.

384
00:21:34,315 --> 00:21:39,017
And that means that it has remnants of a magnetic field that can create an aurora.

385
00:21:39,637 --> 00:21:42,858
An aurora is nothing other than a geomagnetic storm

386
00:21:43,298 --> 00:21:46,019
that can knock out frequency of communication,

387
00:21:46,119 --> 00:21:50,621
like the tablets that students are using on the bus to communicate with their rovers.

388
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:54,842
So, we very carefully, in every experience,

389
00:21:54,942 --> 00:21:59,203
orchestrate a moment where the tablets get completely knocked offline.

390
00:21:59,703 --> 00:22:03,924
in a whole buzz blackout caused by this incoming geomagnetic storm.

391
00:22:04,445 --> 00:22:10,467
And students have to work together to navigate this surprise crisis and figure out, oh, what

392
00:22:10,487 --> 00:22:10,987
do we do?

393
00:22:11,067 --> 00:22:12,648
Like, we're in real peril.

394
00:22:12,668 --> 00:22:14,589
We have to be able to get home eventually.

395
00:22:15,649 --> 00:22:20,531
And I think this pretty highly ranks as their favorite moment in the whole experience.

396
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:27,093
So at this point, we'd been designing for our audience largely in broad strokes, just

397
00:22:27,293 --> 00:22:29,074
working with the entire group of kids.

398
00:22:29,645 --> 00:22:32,247
And because each student is actually

399
00:22:32,287 --> 00:22:34,888
having an individual experience on their own tablet,

400
00:22:35,368 --> 00:22:37,969
we could really personalize the experience to each student

401
00:22:38,009 --> 00:22:38,730
as an individual.

402
00:22:39,170 --> 00:22:40,751
And at this point in time, we were really

403
00:22:40,811 --> 00:22:43,072
ready to start grappling with these design challenges.

404
00:22:44,632 --> 00:22:47,934
So at this point, we had this intro sequence

405
00:22:49,315 --> 00:22:52,936
with a sweeping score and exciting story,

406
00:22:53,076 --> 00:22:54,837
as well as a call to action where the adults

407
00:22:54,997 --> 00:22:55,818
asked the kids for help.

408
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:58,934
This leads into the kids designing their rovers

409
00:22:59,195 --> 00:23:00,916
to overcome navigation challenges,

410
00:23:01,756 --> 00:23:04,158
as well as gathering evidence of life on Mars

411
00:23:04,418 --> 00:23:05,499
in their search for curiosity.

412
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,860
And so we had this digital prototype

413
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:09,381
that we could put in the hands of students

414
00:23:09,461 --> 00:23:11,502
and actually just see how they were performing.

415
00:23:12,163 --> 00:23:15,005
And when we did this, we were running another play test.

416
00:23:15,505 --> 00:23:18,887
We actually saw that they were understanding the gameplay.

417
00:23:18,907 --> 00:23:21,209
They were engaging with the science.

418
00:23:21,269 --> 00:23:22,590
They thought Mars was cool, which

419
00:23:22,630 --> 00:23:24,171
at this point in development would

420
00:23:24,211 --> 00:23:25,091
have been bad if they didn't.

421
00:23:26,809 --> 00:23:29,830
And so we're seeing these kids are engaged, except for one

422
00:23:29,850 --> 00:23:33,293
of them, who, as he's progressing roughly

423
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:36,675
equivalent with his peers, he's getting frustrated.

424
00:23:36,715 --> 00:23:39,117
He's not perceiving that he's on the same path as them.

425
00:23:39,557 --> 00:23:42,559
He's not understanding the solutions to problems.

426
00:23:42,579 --> 00:23:44,700
When he beats a level, he doesn't quite understand why.

427
00:23:45,281 --> 00:23:49,143
And he's really clearly getting drawn out of the experience.

428
00:23:49,944 --> 00:23:52,485
So much so that when we told them that the experience is

429
00:23:52,625 --> 00:23:54,246
over and it's time to put your tablets down,

430
00:23:54,689 --> 00:23:57,831
He threw it across the room, and he wanted it as far away

431
00:23:57,851 --> 00:23:58,652
from him as possible.

432
00:23:59,112 --> 00:24:00,853
And as the people responsible for those tablets,

433
00:24:00,913 --> 00:24:02,174
that was a little nerve-wracking.

434
00:24:02,975 --> 00:24:05,436
So we had clearly failed, and I think

435
00:24:05,476 --> 00:24:08,258
it's easy to see how easily we could have missed this sign

436
00:24:08,538 --> 00:24:10,119
had we not been in the room with him.

437
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:13,441
But as much as we had failed, this was also the game's job.

438
00:24:13,942 --> 00:24:16,924
The game is there to teach the kids in a path that

439
00:24:16,964 --> 00:24:19,325
makes sense, and it needs to bring them back in when

440
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:21,867
it recognizes that they're not on that path of optimal

441
00:24:21,887 --> 00:24:22,147
learning.

442
00:24:23,508 --> 00:24:24,428
Engineering is cumulative.

443
00:24:25,230 --> 00:24:27,630
Everything that you learn builds on something that you learned before.

444
00:24:27,850 --> 00:24:31,851
And so if you miss a lesson, we can't rely on that knowledge to build on in the future.

445
00:24:33,031 --> 00:24:35,952
So this is where we can actually use level design as a tool.

446
00:24:36,472 --> 00:24:38,853
So in this video, you can see this is level one.

447
00:24:39,113 --> 00:24:42,674
This is the only moment of direct instruction that we have in the entire game.

448
00:24:43,354 --> 00:24:46,434
And if kids follow it verbatim, they actually can't beat the level.

449
00:24:46,534 --> 00:24:49,335
They have to design a solution to get around this problem,

450
00:24:49,715 --> 00:24:53,616
thereby learning that those big rocks are not traversable by their rover.

451
00:24:54,167 --> 00:24:58,289
We can now rely on this information going forward and build on it in future challenges.

452
00:24:58,970 --> 00:25:05,413
This is important because we can actually apply this lesson to every challenge we introduce to the kids throughout the game.

453
00:25:08,034 --> 00:25:13,977
To step back a moment, we needed to be in the room with the kids to see this kind of disengagement.

454
00:25:14,437 --> 00:25:18,600
It's pretty clear that we wouldn't have been able to see that from screen recordings or...

455
00:25:19,349 --> 00:25:24,190
a playback of the student's play session because, as I said, he was roughly equal with his peers.

456
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:29,552
What we needed to be looking for were things like body language and his visible signs of frustration,

457
00:25:30,032 --> 00:25:33,794
like how he had checked out and how he was collaborating with his classmates.

458
00:25:35,314 --> 00:25:38,936
As it was, we were able to see these because we were in the room watching the students,

459
00:25:39,296 --> 00:25:43,397
not the game, and we were able to redesign the experience to circumnavigate

460
00:25:43,617 --> 00:25:45,378
this ever happening again with students.

461
00:25:46,375 --> 00:25:47,416
On the other hand, there are some things

462
00:25:47,436 --> 00:25:48,437
that you'll see in play tests

463
00:25:48,477 --> 00:25:50,739
that you actually want to bolster in your game.

464
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,000
You want to design for those.

465
00:25:52,701 --> 00:25:53,662
If it's players cheating,

466
00:25:54,002 --> 00:25:55,984
that's actually a sign that they've found something engaging.

467
00:25:56,104 --> 00:25:57,565
If they're thinking through your rules

468
00:25:57,685 --> 00:25:59,106
well enough to find workarounds,

469
00:25:59,667 --> 00:26:01,629
they have found something that they find exciting.

470
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:03,690
Playing with trade-offs,

471
00:26:04,451 --> 00:26:07,133
if a kid is super focused on what you've designed,

472
00:26:07,354 --> 00:26:09,495
or if they're experimenting with your mechanics,

473
00:26:09,536 --> 00:26:11,918
these are all signs that you've done something right,

474
00:26:12,538 --> 00:26:13,599
even if it was by accident.

475
00:26:14,975 --> 00:26:18,218
And it turns out that this is super easy to see with middle schoolers,

476
00:26:18,278 --> 00:26:21,381
because unlike adults, they don't wait for instruction.

477
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:23,082
They will just poke at things.

478
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:24,524
They get bored very fast.

479
00:26:24,564 --> 00:26:27,126
And I think this leads to them being like, I'm just

480
00:26:27,146 --> 00:26:28,047
going to mess with your game.

481
00:26:28,927 --> 00:26:33,892
While we saw this, we were actually able to just take out all of the rules

482
00:26:34,672 --> 00:26:39,356
and let kids design the game so that kids could discover the mechanics

483
00:26:39,376 --> 00:26:40,037
that we were designing.

484
00:26:40,457 --> 00:26:43,020
So here, you can see that this kid is collecting evidence.

485
00:26:43,694 --> 00:26:46,655
And he's found a solution to this problem,

486
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,495
but we never instruct them how to do this.

487
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,996
The screen will pretty much respond to any input

488
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:53,257
that they provide, prompting them to go further,

489
00:26:53,317 --> 00:26:54,797
to dig deeper into the mechanics.

490
00:26:57,658 --> 00:26:59,018
It was also clear from this play test

491
00:26:59,078 --> 00:27:00,498
that no one learns the same way.

492
00:27:00,779 --> 00:27:02,839
And while that's sort of obvious in hindsight,

493
00:27:03,139 --> 00:27:05,300
it's something we found we could design into the experience.

494
00:27:05,940 --> 00:27:08,681
While in commercial games, it's a bit of gray area

495
00:27:08,781 --> 00:27:11,501
to have your game change its difficulty based

496
00:27:11,541 --> 00:27:12,582
on how players are performing.

497
00:27:13,127 --> 00:27:15,107
If a player comes back and sees that the game's different,

498
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,748
they're not going to be super happy about that.

499
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:18,649
In our case, kids never come back.

500
00:27:18,709 --> 00:27:19,429
They play this once.

501
00:27:19,909 --> 00:27:23,350
So we could completely have the game reroute its trajectory

502
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:26,151
to best serve the learning goals of each student.

503
00:27:27,952 --> 00:27:29,633
So you can see in this screen, which

504
00:27:29,693 --> 00:27:31,413
is where students redesign their rovers,

505
00:27:31,574 --> 00:27:33,494
that there are a number of locked icons at the bottom.

506
00:27:34,135 --> 00:27:37,256
Each of those icons represents a category of tool.

507
00:27:37,356 --> 00:27:41,137
So we have evidence collection, power, and cameras.

508
00:27:41,702 --> 00:27:44,304
And so each of those categories represents a different challenge

509
00:27:44,324 --> 00:27:45,544
that we can introduce to players.

510
00:27:46,105 --> 00:27:47,886
And with this system, we can actually

511
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:50,267
introduce each new challenge at a time

512
00:27:50,287 --> 00:27:51,688
that is optimal for that player.

513
00:27:52,048 --> 00:27:53,989
The game asks, how did you do on the last level?

514
00:27:54,169 --> 00:27:55,410
Are you ready for the next challenge?

515
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:58,031
Or should we reinforce that with another level that

516
00:27:58,091 --> 00:27:58,972
tests the same thing?

517
00:28:01,533 --> 00:28:03,874
And finally, and this is my favorite point

518
00:28:03,954 --> 00:28:07,056
from this entire design process, our players

519
00:28:07,096 --> 00:28:09,237
derive immense pleasure from breaking your game.

520
00:28:09,816 --> 00:28:12,397
We saw across the board early in development,

521
00:28:12,477 --> 00:28:13,718
you know, our game was a prototype,

522
00:28:13,818 --> 00:28:16,339
so it wasn't catering to everyone as well as it could be.

523
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:18,721
And kids would check out and you can see it,

524
00:28:18,861 --> 00:28:19,901
it's so easy to see.

525
00:28:20,642 --> 00:28:22,163
And then they would break the game

526
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:23,944
and find something that, you know,

527
00:28:23,964 --> 00:28:25,344
they were pulling the wool over our eyes.

528
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:26,625
And suddenly they were excited,

529
00:28:26,645 --> 00:28:28,386
they were like, look what I did, I beat you.

530
00:28:29,366 --> 00:28:31,127
Which is great, but how do we design that

531
00:28:31,167 --> 00:28:32,008
into the experience?

532
00:28:32,908 --> 00:28:35,490
So here you can see a student has figured out

533
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,350
that he can...

534
00:28:37,609 --> 00:28:40,350
view the logic that defines where he can drive his rover.

535
00:28:40,790 --> 00:28:43,190
So the green sections he can drive fast, yellow slower,

536
00:28:43,310 --> 00:28:44,991
and red his battery will die well

537
00:28:45,031 --> 00:28:46,031
before he gets to the finish.

538
00:28:47,351 --> 00:28:49,512
And he figured that out just by scribbling all over the map

539
00:28:49,552 --> 00:28:50,952
rather than drawing a single line, which

540
00:28:51,012 --> 00:28:52,092
is what we wanted him to do.

541
00:28:52,712 --> 00:28:54,013
At the time, this was actually broken.

542
00:28:54,373 --> 00:28:56,993
You could only draw a line as long as you could drive,

543
00:28:57,133 --> 00:28:58,614
so it wouldn't let you draw further.

544
00:28:59,174 --> 00:29:01,494
He'd just drawn so fast that it skipped the condition,

545
00:29:01,794 --> 00:29:02,935
and he could keep drawing forever.

546
00:29:04,099 --> 00:29:06,940
Rather than just fixing the logic problem here,

547
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:08,541
we actually re-engineered this mechanic

548
00:29:09,001 --> 00:29:10,962
so that we have a battery meter at the bottom

549
00:29:11,002 --> 00:29:12,903
now that displays how far your rover can drive.

550
00:29:13,203 --> 00:29:14,964
And we let students draw a line as long as they want.

551
00:29:15,485 --> 00:29:17,186
We never tell kids that this is an option

552
00:29:17,246 --> 00:29:19,327
because there are better ways to play.

553
00:29:19,427 --> 00:29:21,088
But if someone discovers this, they

554
00:29:21,128 --> 00:29:22,188
get some excitement out of that.

555
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,069
They feel like they've pulled the wool over our eyes.

556
00:29:28,171 --> 00:29:30,513
So as you can see, some students get super,

557
00:29:31,221 --> 00:29:34,342
honed in on what's happening in front of them on the tablets.

558
00:29:34,802 --> 00:29:35,562
And that's awesome.

559
00:29:35,602 --> 00:29:37,443
That's creating this deep learning

560
00:29:37,523 --> 00:29:39,303
experience of engagement.

561
00:29:39,323 --> 00:29:40,443
They're doing engineering.

562
00:29:41,244 --> 00:29:46,445
But they're doing this on a huge bus with 16 4K televisions

563
00:29:46,585 --> 00:29:50,166
on wraparound screens simulating immersion on Mars.

564
00:29:50,606 --> 00:29:53,187
So if we have them staring down at their tablets

565
00:29:53,227 --> 00:29:55,548
the whole time, they're kind of missing

566
00:29:55,588 --> 00:29:58,068
the potential of this big collaborative space

567
00:29:58,108 --> 00:29:59,749
that we have opened up for them.

568
00:30:00,469 --> 00:30:00,549
And.

569
00:30:01,062 --> 00:30:06,306
It was kind of on us to really figure out how to direct their attention at the right moments.

570
00:30:08,007 --> 00:30:13,571
So where we were in the experience is that we put a lot of careful thought into the subtle cues

571
00:30:14,392 --> 00:30:20,236
of teaching, guiding students through the game on the tablet. We'd figured out how to introduce

572
00:30:20,396 --> 00:30:25,339
all kinds of cool science, including using your cameras to find different types of evidence.

573
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:28,922
Everything in the game had a meaning and we had

574
00:30:30,503 --> 00:30:35,949
Borrowed very cool real science clues from real Mars science

575
00:30:36,169 --> 00:30:38,411
on what rovers are actually collecting on the planet.

576
00:30:40,113 --> 00:30:46,840
And use those to guide students towards finding curiosity.

577
00:30:47,662 --> 00:30:52,724
The one thing we will not reveal in this talk is how students actually find the Curiosity rover,

578
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:57,967
but when they do, they're able to send up all the evidence that they've collected to be analyzed

579
00:30:58,127 --> 00:31:02,109
and test whether they think there's likely life on Mars or not.

580
00:31:03,110 --> 00:31:08,772
So in our fourth playtest, we had created this end-to-end game where we could get from the start to the finish

581
00:31:09,133 --> 00:31:11,354
and still had some time to make a few changes.

582
00:31:12,147 --> 00:31:13,749
When we were able to set it up in the room,

583
00:31:13,949 --> 00:31:15,750
we could just sort of start the experience

584
00:31:15,790 --> 00:31:18,332
and then sit back and observe what students were doing.

585
00:31:20,594 --> 00:31:21,855
As I said, we still had some time.

586
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:24,557
But given that we were doing this all in 13 weeks,

587
00:31:24,597 --> 00:31:27,580
we had a big presentation and deliverable coming up.

588
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:30,522
We wanted really good stats on the playability.

589
00:31:30,582 --> 00:31:33,104
We wanted to understand how it was going to scale.

590
00:31:33,865 --> 00:31:36,727
And so we did the largest play test we'd done yet.

591
00:31:37,187 --> 00:31:40,330
And we had only one tablet per student.

592
00:31:40,390 --> 00:31:41,491
And we had no backups.

593
00:31:42,757 --> 00:31:48,663
And had things gone really well, you know, we could have gotten reinforcement of the

594
00:31:48,703 --> 00:31:54,128
data that we did, but things did not go well and one tablet died completely and we had

595
00:31:54,349 --> 00:31:54,929
no backup.

596
00:31:55,630 --> 00:32:00,595
So where we could have thanked the student whose tablet died and sent her on her way,

597
00:32:00,915 --> 00:32:04,939
we actually paired her up with another student and they worked together on one tablet.

598
00:32:06,420 --> 00:32:06,921
And while

599
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:11,662
One player per one tablet had really demonstrated good intuitive learning.

600
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:12,863
They were engaged with the game.

601
00:32:13,143 --> 00:32:17,325
We had no idea what was going to happen when we put two students on one tablet.

602
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,267
Would they start competing? Would they take turns? Who knew?

603
00:32:21,987 --> 00:32:26,549
And what we did find was that all of a sudden they weren't negotiating each move.

604
00:32:27,029 --> 00:32:33,112
And they were speaking aloud the exact answers to the questions we were trying to ask them at the end of the game,

605
00:32:33,172 --> 00:32:35,933
by which time no one wanted to talk about it or they'd already forgotten.

606
00:32:36,314 --> 00:32:37,034
So these students...

607
00:32:37,710 --> 00:32:40,212
had taken a huge step forward in their learning.

608
00:32:40,412 --> 00:32:42,553
And we had an educator in the room

609
00:32:42,633 --> 00:32:45,295
who referred to this, in educator speak,

610
00:32:45,515 --> 00:32:47,356
as metacognitive learning.

611
00:32:47,997 --> 00:32:50,098
And what that means is that's the difference

612
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,961
from saying, I know, to saying, I know what I know.

613
00:32:53,981 --> 00:32:58,424
And it is this meta sense of learning,

614
00:32:59,005 --> 00:33:02,307
and it demonstrates a real absorption and retention

615
00:33:02,527 --> 00:33:04,368
of the knowledge that they've built through the game.

616
00:33:05,193 --> 00:33:07,975
So we suddenly realized that collaboration wasn't just

617
00:33:08,195 --> 00:33:10,717
a nice, fluffy aspiration for this game,

618
00:33:10,777 --> 00:33:13,660
but that it was really quite essential to doing

619
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:15,021
what we wanted it to do.

620
00:33:15,982 --> 00:33:19,745
And while we're figuring out how to direct students

621
00:33:20,205 --> 00:33:22,207
from their tablets to working with one another,

622
00:33:22,267 --> 00:33:23,988
to working on the big screens, it all just

623
00:33:24,028 --> 00:33:26,650
became a big challenge of choreography.

624
00:33:27,191 --> 00:33:30,573
And with so little time left to really change course

625
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:33,976
and the experience, we had to pull a few tricks out

626
00:33:34,016 --> 00:33:34,476
of the hat.

627
00:33:35,510 --> 00:33:38,672
One of which was to just offload our technical challenges

628
00:33:38,892 --> 00:33:40,833
into what we call meet space.

629
00:33:41,194 --> 00:33:43,355
That is the space that you and I occupy.

630
00:33:44,276 --> 00:33:48,338
And where we could have done really complex peer-to-peer

631
00:33:48,578 --> 00:33:51,440
networking with tablets to allow them to collaborate together,

632
00:33:51,921 --> 00:33:57,304
we instead added simple cues to encourage students to

633
00:33:57,344 --> 00:33:58,885
collaborate together offline.

634
00:34:00,306 --> 00:34:03,808
Where we could have provided very detailed tool tips.

635
00:34:04,360 --> 00:34:09,804
Whenever we find a student needs some reinforcement or a new suggestion while they're playing the game,

636
00:34:10,184 --> 00:34:15,628
we instead have the facilitator of the experience be in character on the bus,

637
00:34:15,688 --> 00:34:18,670
there to observe students in real time,

638
00:34:19,191 --> 00:34:23,234
and we really just needed to figure out how to create tools for that person.

639
00:34:23,934 --> 00:34:27,677
And these were ultimately tools that would help parameterize problems

640
00:34:28,077 --> 00:34:31,100
rather than overly optimize on a single solution.

641
00:34:31,593 --> 00:34:35,455
And there are a lot of things that had to be dynamic about this experience,

642
00:34:35,975 --> 00:34:37,676
ranging from the play time.

643
00:34:38,316 --> 00:34:41,078
I said roughly that a class period is 45 minutes,

644
00:34:41,158 --> 00:34:44,819
but it could range anywhere from 30 minutes all the way up to 90 minutes.

645
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,020
So our experience had to shrink or grow.

646
00:34:48,221 --> 00:34:49,982
Another part was the difficulty.

647
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,544
If they're working with a particularly young class

648
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:56,085
or a particularly advanced class,

649
00:34:56,145 --> 00:34:58,926
they needed to be able to scale the difficulty.

650
00:35:00,247 --> 00:35:00,347
And...

651
00:35:01,026 --> 00:35:06,390
Thirdly, something could break or there could be a big hang up in the experience for whatever reason,

652
00:35:06,891 --> 00:35:13,456
and rather than stress test every single infinite edge case, we needed to simply create the tools

653
00:35:13,516 --> 00:35:19,320
for the facilitator to advance the whole game when they realized they needed to. So we're relying

654
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:25,965
on some human intuition, which of course not every game has access to, but we fully use it to our

655
00:35:26,005 --> 00:35:30,429
advantage. So coming back to this collaboration and directing attention.

656
00:35:31,283 --> 00:35:36,747
We brought in Tanya again to inspire how we might present some clues offline to encourage

657
00:35:37,727 --> 00:35:38,948
students to work together.

658
00:35:39,649 --> 00:35:45,713
And she taught us that the Curiosity rover actually has JPL printed into its tracks in

659
00:35:45,753 --> 00:35:51,197
Morse code so that it's driving, as it's driving along Mars, it's leaving that message printed

660
00:35:51,237 --> 00:35:51,937
into the sand.

661
00:35:52,602 --> 00:35:57,666
And so we have the students find clues that don't say JPL,

662
00:35:57,706 --> 00:36:00,668
but they are Morse code clue that they have to work together

663
00:36:00,728 --> 00:36:03,930
to crack in order to figure out in what direction the rover

664
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:04,311
headed.

665
00:36:04,991 --> 00:36:07,433
And we found that by introducing this early in the game

666
00:36:07,993 --> 00:36:10,915
and foreshadowing the play pattern that we wanted students

667
00:36:10,955 --> 00:36:14,378
to use to succeed, they collaborated far more

668
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,759
frequently throughout the rest of the experience.

669
00:36:18,541 --> 00:36:21,983
In celebrating the individual contribution to the group.

670
00:36:22,551 --> 00:36:26,154
we needed to figure out how to display player impact.

671
00:36:26,694 --> 00:36:30,357
And one way we did this was simply to count and display

672
00:36:30,417 --> 00:36:32,658
all the evidence and clues that they were collecting.

673
00:36:33,139 --> 00:36:38,042
But another key moment was that at the beginning of the game,

674
00:36:38,503 --> 00:36:40,524
before they get into the engineering part,

675
00:36:40,564 --> 00:36:43,947
they really just get to choose the personality of their rover.

676
00:36:44,007 --> 00:36:48,370
And we do this through audio and expression and color

677
00:36:48,490 --> 00:36:49,871
and flags that they'll select.

678
00:36:50,443 --> 00:36:53,005
So that when the rover is on the big screens,

679
00:36:53,085 --> 00:36:54,325
that they recognize it.

680
00:36:54,966 --> 00:36:58,888
And as you can see here, what the rovers have in common

681
00:36:58,968 --> 00:37:00,369
is that the wheels are the same.

682
00:37:00,849 --> 00:37:03,470
Because we couldn't just make an open-ended design rover.

683
00:37:03,570 --> 00:37:05,291
These things had to be re-engineered

684
00:37:05,451 --> 00:37:06,432
to have real meaning.

685
00:37:06,932 --> 00:37:09,193
So at the beginning of the game, all that actually matters

686
00:37:09,453 --> 00:37:12,155
is that they have a certain set of wheels

687
00:37:12,835 --> 00:37:15,216
to be able to iterate from the same base.

688
00:37:15,696 --> 00:37:17,337
And none of the other components matter.

689
00:37:17,357 --> 00:37:19,578
So they do feel a lot of ownership.

690
00:37:20,130 --> 00:37:21,770
when they're first creating these rovers.

691
00:37:22,550 --> 00:37:24,330
When they launch them onto the big screens,

692
00:37:24,370 --> 00:37:27,791
this is quite a magic moment for students to look up.

693
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:30,391
And these words from Arthur C. Clarke,

694
00:37:30,451 --> 00:37:33,072
that any significantly advanced technology

695
00:37:33,532 --> 00:37:35,452
is indistinguishable from magic,

696
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:38,833
is really what we were striving for in this experience.

697
00:37:39,533 --> 00:37:42,053
And I want to remind you that although everything going on

698
00:37:42,234 --> 00:37:44,774
is going to seem magic to the students,

699
00:37:44,834 --> 00:37:48,935
and that's really how they wanted to experience the content.

700
00:37:49,502 --> 00:37:56,526
It is accurate, it is real science, except where we've necessarily had to make leaps to get them to Mars.

701
00:37:57,566 --> 00:38:04,270
So we're both trying to meet the needs of educators and students by combining technology and magic.

702
00:38:06,711 --> 00:38:11,134
So at this point, we'd created an experience that really made the kids the experts,

703
00:38:11,614 --> 00:38:16,336
both in terms of the content and how they are perceiving it and its relationship to them.

704
00:38:17,204 --> 00:38:20,366
and in terms of who we need to go to to actually finish this experience.

705
00:38:21,087 --> 00:38:24,189
At this point in time, we have the full student experience built,

706
00:38:24,689 --> 00:38:26,090
but it's actually not on the bus.

707
00:38:26,311 --> 00:38:29,613
It's in a prototype environment in our office in San Francisco.

708
00:38:30,213 --> 00:38:33,476
We had to go down to Burbank to actually stick it on this thing,

709
00:38:34,016 --> 00:38:37,619
which at the time was really just a big metal box in a parking lot.

710
00:38:38,059 --> 00:38:40,521
There was a long road ahead of us of dealing with

711
00:38:41,862 --> 00:38:43,903
the ability of graphics cards to render 16 4K videos.

712
00:38:46,169 --> 00:38:50,011
to dealing with networking issues that arise when you are sitting inside a big metal box.

713
00:38:50,831 --> 00:38:56,053
So, fast forward six months, and we have what you see, the final bus,

714
00:38:56,373 --> 00:39:01,175
and we run our final playtest with kids in the DC area, actually on the bus.

715
00:39:02,236 --> 00:39:06,217
As kids approach, they see a bus. It's cooler than usual,

716
00:39:06,337 --> 00:39:09,218
but it's definitely not going to, like, take off or go to space or anything.

717
00:39:09,912 --> 00:39:14,415
Their first clue that something is up is when they come into the captain's area, the driver's seat,

718
00:39:14,695 --> 00:39:21,318
and they see this futuristic sci-fi area with a control panel and a joystick and all that.

719
00:39:22,078 --> 00:39:27,881
They then go into the main cabin, where you can see all of the windows are TVs,

720
00:39:28,121 --> 00:39:33,584
displaying a live feed of what's outside, so they can actually see and wave to their fellow students as they get on the bus.

721
00:39:34,405 --> 00:39:36,806
The facilitator comes on, acting as the mission commander.

722
00:39:37,307 --> 00:39:38,687
and tells them, all right, we're going to go to Mars.

723
00:39:38,707 --> 00:39:41,629
We're going to help NASA discover if there's evidence of life there.

724
00:39:42,209 --> 00:39:44,671
At which point, they take off and go into orbit.

725
00:39:45,131 --> 00:39:48,293
They fly past the Hubble Space Telescope and the International Space Station,

726
00:39:48,453 --> 00:39:50,694
at which point the astronauts there actually say hello.

727
00:39:51,755 --> 00:39:53,976
And then they travel to Mars, which, of course,

728
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,338
they actually travel throughout the solar system.

729
00:39:57,778 --> 00:40:00,119
And they learn what the criteria that we

730
00:40:00,179 --> 00:40:02,721
think there is for there actually being life in the universe.

731
00:40:03,561 --> 00:40:05,983
This does involve going faster than light, of course.

732
00:40:07,148 --> 00:40:09,930
At which point they land on Mars and experience this.

733
00:40:12,212 --> 00:40:13,593
Are we alone in the universe?

734
00:40:14,674 --> 00:40:16,175
Is there life on other planets?

735
00:40:17,256 --> 00:40:20,959
Explorers have been asking these questions since the beginning of time.

736
00:40:21,659 --> 00:40:26,203
Today, you'll be joining that grand tradition of space exploration.

737
00:40:27,564 --> 00:40:28,324
Explore a lab.

738
00:40:28,725 --> 00:40:32,027
It's now your job to locate Curiosity and its tools.

739
00:40:36,687 --> 00:40:42,089
To do that, you will need to deploy a unit of rovers and log any evidence of life you find along the way.

740
00:40:48,412 --> 00:40:58,177
Explorers, do you accept your mission?

741
00:41:06,853 --> 00:41:09,054
So while they're on Mars, they work together

742
00:41:09,154 --> 00:41:12,196
to follow the clues that Curiosity has left behind,

743
00:41:12,616 --> 00:41:14,717
discovering if there is evidence of life along the way.

744
00:41:16,078 --> 00:41:18,259
During which time, they actually deal

745
00:41:18,359 --> 00:41:20,220
with the realities of the Martian geography,

746
00:41:20,300 --> 00:41:23,162
including a full bus blackout and aurora.

747
00:41:23,902 --> 00:41:26,143
At which point, somehow, they find Curiosity

748
00:41:26,384 --> 00:41:28,125
and send all of the evidence they've gathered

749
00:41:28,205 --> 00:41:29,405
to the rover to be analyzed.

750
00:41:29,826 --> 00:41:30,806
At the end of the experience,

751
00:41:31,026 --> 00:41:33,047
they actually get to make a recommendation to NASA

752
00:41:33,227 --> 00:41:34,868
of what they think the likelihood

753
00:41:34,908 --> 00:41:36,129
of there being life on Mars is.

754
00:41:37,262 --> 00:41:41,882
The rovers then parade back past the windows as they go back into storage for the journey

755
00:41:41,922 --> 00:41:42,102
home.

756
00:41:42,843 --> 00:41:49,244
The bus then lifts off, returns the students to their class parking lot, at which point

757
00:41:49,284 --> 00:41:52,804
they look outside and invariably see that it's snowing and start asking if they can

758
00:41:52,844 --> 00:41:53,424
go back to Mars.

759
00:41:57,005 --> 00:42:00,346
Until now, we've reached about 2,500 people.

760
00:42:00,426 --> 00:42:02,546
The bus has been in operation since January.

761
00:42:03,766 --> 00:42:04,887
Of a sample of those...

762
00:42:05,823 --> 00:42:08,665
A majority were non-white and more than half were girls.

763
00:42:10,906 --> 00:42:14,368
78% said that they had a stronger interest in completing high school, with more than

764
00:42:14,428 --> 00:42:17,690
half also saying that they had brighter prospects in a STEM career.

765
00:42:18,811 --> 00:42:23,433
And so with that, we'd like to leave you with a couple of takeaways, a couple of provocations

766
00:42:23,533 --> 00:42:26,235
to hopefully inspire future design in this area.

767
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:32,459
The first is, how might we link education and play to make meaningful change in students'

768
00:42:32,579 --> 00:42:33,820
access to opportunities?

769
00:42:36,381 --> 00:42:39,223
And second, how might we step into someone else's shoes

770
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:41,465
when we design games, rather than designing games

771
00:42:41,485 --> 00:42:42,405
that appeal to ourselves?

772
00:42:45,047 --> 00:42:46,789
So with that, I'm Peter Slattery.

773
00:42:46,969 --> 00:42:49,050
I'm a senior game designer at IDEO.

774
00:42:49,831 --> 00:42:52,133
I have a fine art and computer science background

775
00:42:52,233 --> 00:42:53,714
from Rhode Island School of Design,

776
00:42:54,254 --> 00:42:57,377
where I started designing games and have since taught game

777
00:42:57,397 --> 00:43:00,539
design in Georgia and Boston, as well as designing games

778
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:03,261
for IDEO, like The Bus, as well as designing some games that

779
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:04,061
have gone to CES.

780
00:43:05,466 --> 00:43:10,409
Oh, and extreme environments qualifications were, of course, important for this project.

781
00:43:10,789 --> 00:43:15,553
So I've been developing mine since I was 11 as a Boy Scout, moving into getting lost canoeing

782
00:43:15,573 --> 00:43:18,995
in the Canadian wilderness, as well as running high-intensity obstacle course races.

783
00:43:20,716 --> 00:43:21,716
I'm Kate Schnippering.

784
00:43:21,756 --> 00:43:23,698
I'm a software design lead at IDEO.

785
00:43:24,058 --> 00:43:28,541
My background's in computer science and fine art from Dartmouth, and I've been making games

786
00:43:28,681 --> 00:43:33,244
at IDEO, GTAR, creating guitars that teach you how to play guitar.

787
00:43:34,017 --> 00:43:37,540
at height and seat creating James Bond interactive fiction games.

788
00:43:38,681 --> 00:43:43,865
And some of my extreme environment qualifications include scuba diving down to 40 meters and

789
00:43:43,945 --> 00:43:46,487
climbing to the furthest point from the center of the earth.

790
00:43:49,349 --> 00:43:53,112
We definitely want to acknowledge that it was not just the two of us working on this.

791
00:43:53,152 --> 00:43:57,655
There are a lot of partners collaborating on this project from our company IDEO,

792
00:43:58,195 --> 00:44:01,578
Whiskey Tree, the masters of the beautiful computer graphics.

793
00:44:02,137 --> 00:44:03,957
You might know them from Star Wars.

794
00:44:04,878 --> 00:44:06,558
Matt Hutchinson, our composer.

795
00:44:07,198 --> 00:44:09,499
MD Bio, our facilitator team.

796
00:44:09,979 --> 00:44:14,241
West Coast Customs, fabricators of the bus, also

797
00:44:14,281 --> 00:44:15,481
known for Pimp My Ride.

798
00:44:16,261 --> 00:44:18,982
And Verizon Innovative Learning, who made this all

799
00:44:19,042 --> 00:44:19,563
possible.

800
00:44:20,423 --> 00:44:23,884
But I want you to remember that we designed this for

801
00:44:23,944 --> 00:44:27,065
kids, and this is really at the forefront of all of our

802
00:44:27,105 --> 00:44:28,086
minds the whole time.

803
00:44:28,126 --> 00:44:28,926
We're not doing this.

804
00:44:29,345 --> 00:44:32,807
to launch a product just for the sake of making something cool.

805
00:44:33,387 --> 00:44:38,410
We want to do this to help those kids be in this room in the future.

806
00:44:38,930 --> 00:44:43,753
And if this experience can cause just one kid to go through what Tanya did

807
00:44:44,233 --> 00:44:49,496
and have this like awakening moment of discovering that science might be for them,

808
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:51,757
then we've really succeeded.

809
00:44:52,637 --> 00:44:54,698
Thank you so much for attending our talk.

810
00:45:05,109 --> 00:45:06,389
And we have time for questions.

811
00:45:07,270 --> 00:45:08,210
Hi, great work.

812
00:45:08,651 --> 00:45:10,532
I have a three-part question.

813
00:45:10,692 --> 00:45:14,534
Can you talk about budget, time constraints, and team

814
00:45:14,574 --> 00:45:17,216
composition, like how you guys distributed the work?

815
00:45:19,357 --> 00:45:22,299
Yeah, so the portion that we've shown here is the design

816
00:45:22,379 --> 00:45:23,879
of the student experience.

817
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:27,241
And in that case, it was these 13 weeks.

818
00:45:27,642 --> 00:45:30,703
The subsequent following phases, there were several

819
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:33,825
rounds of revision and putting it on the bus, which

820
00:45:35,030 --> 00:45:39,833
are not logical from a team budget and et cetera timing standpoint.

821
00:45:39,853 --> 00:45:44,376
So I'm just speaking to the student experience, which is probably most relevant to anybody

822
00:45:44,476 --> 00:45:44,676
else.

823
00:45:45,497 --> 00:45:50,219
There were five of us on the team, the team that we showed earlier in the slides, including

824
00:45:50,920 --> 00:45:59,065
software, game design, education design, slash systems, interaction design, and different

825
00:45:59,105 --> 00:46:03,268
support from writing and research kind of integrated along the way.

826
00:46:04,362 --> 00:46:06,422
And we kind of set it up like work streams.

827
00:46:06,442 --> 00:46:10,323
So instead of having a project manager overseeing everything,

828
00:46:10,623 --> 00:46:13,864
we really just shared ownership over different parts

829
00:46:13,944 --> 00:46:16,945
so that they would kind of come in and out of confluence.

830
00:46:17,125 --> 00:46:19,286
And in that this was client work,

831
00:46:19,786 --> 00:46:22,646
we had occasional check-ins with our client,

832
00:46:22,666 --> 00:46:25,247
but they let us run pretty freely to propose

833
00:46:25,327 --> 00:46:28,088
what we felt was the right solution to the ultimate problem.

834
00:46:29,175 --> 00:46:32,396
The budget questions, I'll have to look up the numbers.

835
00:46:32,436 --> 00:46:39,098
I don't know off the top of my head, but the whole project in terms of everything put into

836
00:46:39,178 --> 00:46:41,138
it including the bus would be a couple million.

837
00:46:41,999 --> 00:46:45,680
Thank you.

838
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:47,480
Hi, thank you for the presentation.

839
00:46:47,580 --> 00:46:48,600
I did like the bus part.

840
00:46:49,298 --> 00:46:55,323
At some point in your presentation, you talked about the deep learning experience the students were having.

841
00:46:55,783 --> 00:47:00,647
So my question is, how do you define deep learning experience students are having?

842
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:07,252
And what are the indicators you are looking at to say, oh, they are having deep learning?

843
00:47:08,734 --> 00:47:13,057
So this goes back to the way we were structuring the level design of the game.

844
00:47:13,157 --> 00:47:15,639
So, on the one hand, it's...

845
00:47:17,051 --> 00:47:21,053
There is no engineering curriculum in the US public school system.

846
00:47:21,113 --> 00:47:24,896
There's no... We picked one that schools can opt into,

847
00:47:25,296 --> 00:47:27,177
and we sort of went with their guidelines,

848
00:47:27,417 --> 00:47:29,818
but no school is actually testing this afterwards.

849
00:47:30,239 --> 00:47:33,200
So what we had to do was make the test internal to the game itself.

850
00:47:34,621 --> 00:47:37,043
And so we could design...

851
00:47:37,343 --> 00:47:40,465
If we were designing each level to teach one concept,

852
00:47:40,965 --> 00:47:42,366
then if a kid passes that level,

853
00:47:42,406 --> 00:47:45,007
we can say that they've at least learned that idea.

854
00:47:45,618 --> 00:47:49,300
As they continue to apply that again and again and again throughout the rest of the experience,

855
00:47:49,360 --> 00:47:53,321
we gain more and more evidence that they actually have understood that concept

856
00:47:53,361 --> 00:47:56,202
and are able to apply it in a multitude of other scenarios.

857
00:47:56,802 --> 00:48:02,223
So by designing our learning assessment into the experience itself,

858
00:48:02,303 --> 00:48:05,144
we can actually just look at the game and say, like, this is what we've taught kids.

859
00:48:06,044 --> 00:48:11,386
Along those lines, every level is designed to actually force the kids to re-engineer their rovers to actually...

860
00:48:11,933 --> 00:48:16,635
Analyze, this is what's going wrong, this is why I can't finish this part of the level, and to change it.

861
00:48:16,956 --> 00:48:22,639
And so the core of what we're teaching isn't, oh, they figured out that I have to go around these rocks.

862
00:48:22,739 --> 00:48:27,822
What we're teaching them is that, oh, this is how you analyze a problem, this is how you come up with a solution.

863
00:48:27,962 --> 00:48:30,303
And sometimes that involves just trying some things.

864
00:48:30,783 --> 00:48:34,445
And so every level that they go through, we can actually say they've gone through a full engineering cycle

865
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:38,167
of testing, hypothesis, and then finding a solution.

866
00:48:38,527 --> 00:48:40,248
And so we can use that as our core metric.

867
00:48:40,914 --> 00:48:44,816
Last bit to add to that is that the facilitator team actually run a pre and

868
00:48:44,876 --> 00:48:50,060
post curriculum experience with their classrooms to help them reabsorb it and

869
00:48:50,080 --> 00:48:52,962
reinforce what it is that they want them to take away from it.

870
00:48:53,403 --> 00:48:58,226
Just last question, do you guys have any learning scientists in your design team?

871
00:48:59,227 --> 00:49:03,750
Yes, we did have them coming in and out, although not always staffed full time.

872
00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:11,989
She asked a lot of what I was going to ask, so I'll piggyback on this and ask if you've

873
00:49:12,029 --> 00:49:22,711
had feedback from the classroom teachers comparing the students that went through your program

874
00:49:23,111 --> 00:49:27,612
and their learning experience and how they respond after the experience in the classroom

875
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:28,893
versus kids who hadn't.

876
00:49:28,993 --> 00:49:32,353
If they had given you feedback on any difference that they had noticed.

877
00:49:33,434 --> 00:49:34,814
We don't have direct feedback.

878
00:49:36,385 --> 00:49:37,766
of what you're asking yet.

879
00:49:38,066 --> 00:49:42,927
This is still pretty early, and so the sample of data that we showed at the end is,

880
00:49:43,207 --> 00:49:47,989
it's a much smaller group than the total number of kids that we've reached.

881
00:49:48,089 --> 00:49:50,529
So we're still working on actually collecting that data at the time.

882
00:49:51,250 --> 00:49:53,770
When we did go to the school in DC,

883
00:49:55,167 --> 00:49:59,348
We kind of got there early, before we knew where the bus was, and as we were waiting,

884
00:50:00,048 --> 00:50:06,291
a science teacher took us under her wing. But then she started introducing us to every single teacher we passed in the school,

885
00:50:06,691 --> 00:50:11,152
and the social studies teachers were like, I want to get on this bus, my students need to see this.

886
00:50:11,212 --> 00:50:19,415
They may not be in a science class, but just seeing the organic demand rising when it was in a school was really quite amazing.

887
00:50:20,195 --> 00:50:21,096
The post experience...

888
00:50:22,249 --> 00:50:25,071
Comments and feedback would be really helpful, I think, going forward.

889
00:50:25,391 --> 00:50:25,591
Yes.

890
00:50:27,652 --> 00:50:29,233
And that's kind of where I'm going.

891
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:32,555
You've developed a wonderful thing, but in essence it's a field trip.

892
00:50:33,295 --> 00:50:35,656
And like you said, motivating one of these students.

893
00:50:35,736 --> 00:50:40,039
The experience with Tanya is the fact that she started as a little child with resources.

894
00:50:40,579 --> 00:50:44,121
And so where you wanted to go eventually, because you're like having that experience,

895
00:50:44,261 --> 00:50:47,223
the kids get off this bus, they still don't have access to resources.

896
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:51,883
And so what my challenge would be is all those companies involved would be school

897
00:50:51,903 --> 00:50:54,985
business partnerships to follow these kids and

898
00:50:55,045 --> 00:50:58,128
possibly continue to get those resources into those hands.

899
00:50:58,949 --> 00:51:02,231
These are all schools that Verizon Innovative Learning puts a lot of

900
00:51:02,311 --> 00:51:03,533
like additional support.

901
00:51:03,673 --> 00:51:06,815
I understand that but you have a whole lot of other companies that could do

902
00:51:06,835 --> 00:51:09,918
this school business partnerships for that purpose.

903
00:51:10,198 --> 00:51:11,079
Yes, for sure.

904
00:51:11,219 --> 00:51:11,860
Yeah, thank you.

905
00:51:15,464 --> 00:51:20,709
You mentioned working with a very multidisciplinary team, scientists, software engineers, educators.

906
00:51:21,290 --> 00:51:25,113
How do you make sure that everyone's on the same page despite your disparate fields?

907
00:51:25,153 --> 00:51:26,415
What does that communication look like?

908
00:51:27,195 --> 00:51:33,081
So with a team this size, which in this case I think we consider a luxury, we all were sitting in the same room.

909
00:51:33,641 --> 00:51:39,026
So if, you know, I were trying to design a new, changing designs to our mechanics or something,

910
00:51:39,106 --> 00:51:41,168
I could just turn around and say, hey, I need a minute.

911
00:51:41,511 --> 00:51:42,871
Like, can we talk about this for a second?

912
00:51:42,931 --> 00:51:45,192
And you can achieve cohesion really, really quickly

913
00:51:45,232 --> 00:51:45,512
that way.

914
00:51:46,172 --> 00:51:47,993
And that's sort of why we think it's

915
00:51:48,033 --> 00:51:50,654
important to have small teams that are all

916
00:51:50,694 --> 00:51:53,094
sitting in the same place, is because you

917
00:51:53,135 --> 00:51:55,535
can maintain that cohesion and really

918
00:51:55,595 --> 00:51:59,216
let people working together and get that cross-pollination

919
00:51:59,236 --> 00:52:00,317
of ideas really quickly.

920
00:52:00,337 --> 00:52:01,777
Thank you very much.

921
00:52:05,223 --> 00:52:11,548
Hi, do you define the skills that children learn?

922
00:52:11,608 --> 00:52:15,270
The exact skills, so maybe like problem solving,

923
00:52:15,410 --> 00:52:19,793
and do you have like also metrics for this?

924
00:52:21,875 --> 00:52:24,116
So the metrics that we have at the moment,

925
00:52:24,156 --> 00:52:25,437
so again, we are still building out

926
00:52:25,777 --> 00:52:27,839
our ability to get feedback on our end,

927
00:52:28,820 --> 00:52:30,361
are what we were sharing before.

928
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,742
OK, thanks.

929
00:52:35,879 --> 00:52:38,620
Hi, great work. Really appreciated the presentation. Thank you very much.

930
00:52:40,081 --> 00:52:43,982
I work with a lot of high school students in after-school programs.

931
00:52:44,523 --> 00:52:50,805
Curious to hear any thoughts, tips, or best practices you have with regard to, on the one hand,

932
00:52:51,005 --> 00:52:57,668
really building an awesome, engaging game, on the one hand, versus the dopamine explosion

933
00:52:57,728 --> 00:53:03,971
and potentially negative, addictive elements of games sometimes that are being grappled with as well.

934
00:53:05,177 --> 00:53:06,577
Yeah, that's a great question.

935
00:53:06,657 --> 00:53:11,798
I think it, I would say in the case of The Bus,

936
00:53:11,918 --> 00:53:14,639
we erred on the side of picking things

937
00:53:14,959 --> 00:53:17,779
that you actually see across media.

938
00:53:18,239 --> 00:53:21,160
So we were relying on, you know,

939
00:53:21,180 --> 00:53:23,400
like the hero's journey is what we built the story on.

940
00:53:23,680 --> 00:53:25,681
And you're worried about,

941
00:53:27,241 --> 00:53:29,141
less about like flashy graphics

942
00:53:29,201 --> 00:53:31,042
and like little moments of reward

943
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,062
and more inspiring that sense of wonder in kids.

944
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:40,921
And those ideas don't really have a one-to-one relationship

945
00:53:40,961 --> 00:53:44,682
with necessarily the kinds of game design

946
00:53:44,702 --> 00:53:45,643
that you're talking about.

947
00:53:46,363 --> 00:53:49,984
So in this case, a lot of that stuff never came up.

948
00:53:50,004 --> 00:53:55,245
There was never a need for instilling a leaderboard

949
00:53:55,685 --> 00:53:58,066
in the game or getting kids to really start

950
00:53:58,086 --> 00:54:00,026
thinking about this in terms of points and badges.

951
00:54:00,386 --> 00:54:01,947
What they're really excited about

952
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:04,067
is that moment when, you know.

953
00:54:05,970 --> 00:54:09,871
The subwoofer that's under each of their seats starts rattling the whole bus because they're taking off.

954
00:54:10,531 --> 00:54:14,632
Or when we actually get to do a wipe and suddenly they're looking down on Jupiter.

955
00:54:15,053 --> 00:54:22,255
Or this player investment is a huge one that you can pull on to actually create the experience you're talking about.

956
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:29,777
Just the fact that I designed a thing here and now it's over there on a big screen driving out onto the surface of Mars.

957
00:54:30,057 --> 00:54:32,878
That sort of thing really gets kids very, very excited.

958
00:54:34,277 --> 00:54:37,299
I would say if you design a compelling experience first

959
00:54:37,399 --> 00:54:39,359
and then worry about the game design a little later,

960
00:54:39,700 --> 00:54:41,680
which I know at this conference is sort of like, whoa,

961
00:54:41,740 --> 00:54:42,321
what are you saying?

962
00:54:43,641 --> 00:54:46,062
But the experience is what you want the kids to have,

963
00:54:46,082 --> 00:54:47,283
and the game facilitates that.

964
00:54:47,783 --> 00:54:49,124
So I think if you go in that order,

965
00:54:49,184 --> 00:54:52,865
you will arrive at a game that gets across what you want.

966
00:54:53,586 --> 00:54:53,826
Awesome.

967
00:54:53,866 --> 00:54:55,826
Your presentation definitely sparked a sense of wonder.

968
00:54:55,866 --> 00:54:56,747
Thank you very much.

969
00:54:56,767 --> 00:54:59,568
Thank you.

970
00:54:59,588 --> 00:54:59,728
Awesome.

971
00:55:00,228 --> 00:55:01,809
I'm going to shout because the mic's high.

972
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:05,263
Hi Peter. You probably know what I'm going to ask.

973
00:55:06,004 --> 00:55:09,065
Was accessibility considered?

974
00:55:12,787 --> 00:55:16,088
There are a number of ways that accessibility comes into the bus.

975
00:55:16,908 --> 00:55:18,969
I've learned a lot this conference, thanks to Cherry.

976
00:55:20,990 --> 00:55:24,431
The black box on the back of the text on the subtitles is part of that.

977
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:27,913
So the bus is wheelchair accessible.

978
00:55:30,055 --> 00:55:38,722
Unfortunately, we weren't able to design through the problem of, like, if there's a student who's blind on the bus, so much of the experience is visual.

979
00:55:39,883 --> 00:55:47,909
But the way we designed the game doesn't rely on a knowledge of reading or great familiarity with the English language.

980
00:55:48,510 --> 00:55:54,975
Most of it's taught through either, well, the only moment that we actually directly teach is taught through visual...

981
00:55:56,552 --> 00:56:01,418
stimuli and then from there the kids just experiment. So we're actually not relying on them coming in with a lot of

982
00:56:02,919 --> 00:56:03,860
resources behind them.

983
00:56:05,322 --> 00:56:12,369
I wonder if accidentally you might have tapped into accessibility for like neurodivergence like autism

984
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:18,076
with the kid that was frustrated and through the pad. By seeing that perhaps that helped you.

985
00:56:19,505 --> 00:56:24,508
By seeing that in person, seeing that kind of like physical frustration, which is often

986
00:56:24,929 --> 00:56:30,732
characteristic of kids with ADHD or autism, that kind of thing, perhaps you accidentally

987
00:56:30,772 --> 00:56:34,774
stepped into that realm of making a more accessible experience.

988
00:56:35,034 --> 00:56:38,316
So I applaud you for working with the kids so early on.

989
00:56:38,336 --> 00:56:39,117
I think it's awesome.

990
00:56:41,999 --> 00:56:42,319
Awesome.

991
00:56:42,459 --> 00:56:44,220
If there are no more questions...

992
00:56:44,420 --> 00:56:45,000
Oh, one more.

993
00:56:45,561 --> 00:56:47,082
I think we have two minutes.

994
00:56:48,748 --> 00:56:51,469
Thanks for the great work and presentation.

995
00:56:51,549 --> 00:56:56,570
My question is what kind of exploration and research did you guys do before you landed

996
00:56:56,670 --> 00:56:59,732
on this bus and game design concept?

997
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:07,394
So the rendering you saw at the beginning of the talk, there was a whole phase of work

998
00:57:07,474 --> 00:57:10,935
before we came on to actually just design the student experience.

999
00:57:11,335 --> 00:57:14,657
And that was a, I believe it was a 13-week project that

1000
00:57:15,382 --> 00:57:19,063
involved actually doing that background research, figuring out what kids would find exciting,

1001
00:57:19,503 --> 00:57:23,305
what we could actually put on a bus, because I think the bus was actually always part of that.

1002
00:57:24,825 --> 00:57:30,007
But that research was done in an earlier phase of work, and we were handed a brief of here's

1003
00:57:30,547 --> 00:57:34,229
the learning goals, the rough outline of the experience, now go design the game.

1004
00:57:34,869 --> 00:57:39,811
Yeah, the very initial concept was to have a mobile maker lab, like with 3D printers and such,

1005
00:57:39,951 --> 00:57:41,651
and I think by going to...

1006
00:57:42,205 --> 00:57:49,830
Aquariums and many art installations. It's slowly pivoted in this more fully digital immersive experience in our

1007
00:57:50,250 --> 00:57:52,611
Research the one thing we did do was bring in

1008
00:57:53,912 --> 00:57:57,314
Wim Hof the Iceman and we took 10-minute ice baths

1009
00:57:58,514 --> 00:58:05,758
basically with our clients to kind of like realize that the like big step into an extreme of

1010
00:58:07,280 --> 00:58:12,241
Not only like what would it be like to be on an extreme environment, but to kind of

1011
00:58:12,261 --> 00:58:14,402
make a big commitment to figuring this out.

1012
00:58:15,862 --> 00:58:22,064
So the making phase was 13 weeks and the research phase before this was 13 weeks.

1013
00:58:23,004 --> 00:58:27,605
How many early concepts did you guys develop before you decide this is one you're going

1014
00:58:27,625 --> 00:58:28,465
to move forward with?

1015
00:58:29,946 --> 00:58:35,727
The Boston student experience itself, it starts with like many, many concepts in like

1016
00:58:36,329 --> 00:58:38,890
Post-it notes in very sketch style scale.

1017
00:58:39,310 --> 00:58:44,971
By the time it got to fully, like highly well envisioned

1018
00:58:44,991 --> 00:58:48,452
concepts, there were about three that were down selected

1019
00:58:48,572 --> 00:58:49,933
in partnership with the client.

1020
00:58:50,413 --> 00:58:55,774
And then at the end of that phase, they prototyped in big

1021
00:58:55,834 --> 00:58:59,635
foam core walkthrough experience with renders like

1022
00:58:59,675 --> 00:59:00,576
the ones you just saw.

1023
00:59:01,216 --> 00:59:01,876
Thank you very much.

1024
00:59:05,141 --> 00:59:10,042
My question is, how do you design around the 30 minute time delay when sending directions to Mars and back?

1025
00:59:13,263 --> 00:59:13,903
We didn't.

1026
00:59:16,003 --> 00:59:18,964
Actually, we put the kids on the bus. So the bus goes to Mars.

1027
00:59:19,684 --> 00:59:24,945
So the time delay is just the distance between them and the rovers, which is the time delay that we're speaking at.

1028
00:59:25,385 --> 00:59:31,366
So we travel faster than light and go all the way to Mars in about five minutes.

1029
00:59:31,566 --> 00:59:33,127
And then we actually go all the way to Pluto.

1030
00:59:33,899 --> 00:59:35,680
and back to Mars in about five minutes,

1031
00:59:35,920 --> 00:59:39,542
and then let them drive their rovers in real time.

1032
00:59:39,562 --> 00:59:41,383
Thank you.

1033
00:59:41,403 --> 00:59:41,683
Good question.

1034
00:59:41,703 --> 00:59:43,224
Yeah, we had some significant debates about that one.

1035
00:59:43,244 --> 00:59:43,364
Okay.

1036
00:59:43,384 --> 00:59:43,544
Awesome.

1037
00:59:43,564 --> 00:59:43,784
Thanks, guys.

1038
00:59:43,804 --> 00:59:44,224
Thank you, everyone.

1039
00:59:44,244 --> 00:59:44,465
Thank you.

1040
00:59:44,485 --> 00:59:44,665
Thank you.

1041
00:59:44,685 --> 00:59:44,925
Thank you.

1042
00:59:44,945 --> 00:59:45,125
Thank you.

1043
00:59:45,145 --> 00:59:45,465
Thank you.

1044
00:59:45,485 --> 00:59:45,665
Thank you.

1045
00:59:45,685 --> 00:59:45,865
Thank you.

1046
00:59:45,885 --> 00:59:46,085
Thank you.

1047
00:59:46,105 --> 00:59:46,305
Thank you.

1048
00:59:47,046 --> 00:59:47,226
Thank you.

1049
00:59:47,246 --> 00:59:47,446
Thank you.

1050
00:59:47,466 --> 00:59:47,666
Thank you.

1051
00:59:47,686 --> 00:59:47,906
Thank you.

1052
00:59:47,926 --> 00:59:48,166
Thank you.

1053
00:59:48,186 --> 00:59:48,367
Thank you.
