1
00:00:05,847 --> 00:00:07,328
Hi there.

2
00:00:07,328 --> 00:00:08,969
Whoa, that's a little loud.

3
00:00:08,969 --> 00:00:10,629
My name's Will Bucher.

4
00:00:10,629 --> 00:00:14,211
And today, I'm going to be speaking with you guys about

5
00:00:14,211 --> 00:00:18,093
social media influencers and non-traditional marketing.

6
00:00:18,093 --> 00:00:21,214
Specifically, I'm going to talk about how you can promote

7
00:00:21,214 --> 00:00:23,815
your game or promote your personal image as an

8
00:00:23,815 --> 00:00:27,817
influencer while also complying with the law.

9
00:00:27,817 --> 00:00:32,159
So before I do that, I'll give you a very brief introduction

10
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:32,980
about myself.

11
00:00:33,599 --> 00:00:38,702
I work at a law firm called Debevoise & Plimpton, and what I do is what we call IP litigation.

12
00:00:38,702 --> 00:00:42,284
That's a fancy word for I deal with companies who are already in disputes.

13
00:00:42,284 --> 00:00:48,107
That means they're arguing with another company about copyright or trademark, and increasingly

14
00:00:48,107 --> 00:00:50,208
those disputes are with the FTC.

15
00:00:50,208 --> 00:00:57,472
That's the Federal Trade Commission, and they're the entity that's responsible for deciding

16
00:00:57,472 --> 00:01:02,254
when a social media post needs a disclosure and what that disclosure should look like.

17
00:01:03,876 --> 00:01:08,580
So today when I talk about social media influencers and non-traditional marketing, I want to be

18
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:10,021
clear what I'm talking about.

19
00:01:10,021 --> 00:01:12,422
I'm talking about a lot of things.

20
00:01:12,422 --> 00:01:17,206
I'm talking about your grandmother's Yelp review, and I'm talking about Drake streaming

21
00:01:17,206 --> 00:01:21,249
Fortnite, and everywhere in between.

22
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:25,272
In today's presentation, we're going to go through some specific examples of platforms,

23
00:01:25,272 --> 00:01:31,056
but the tools I'm going to give you today don't care about what platform you're on and

24
00:01:31,056 --> 00:01:32,738
should apply to platforms in the future.

25
00:01:36,219 --> 00:01:40,003
I'm going to try today to make sure I just talk about risk.

26
00:01:40,003 --> 00:01:43,626
Lawyers like to say you have to do X or you can't do X.

27
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:48,010
And to the extent I can, what I'm going to try and do

28
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:50,692
is identify high-risk practices that you might

29
00:01:50,692 --> 00:01:53,875
be tempted to engage in and then give you some lower-risk

30
00:01:53,875 --> 00:01:56,177
alternatives that might accomplish

31
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:59,380
the exact same marketing goal while reducing the risk

32
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:01,762
that the FTC calls you and that you would eventually

33
00:02:01,762 --> 00:02:02,163
have to call me.

34
00:02:04,684 --> 00:02:08,567
Today's presentation is going to be limited to U.S. federal law, and that's for a couple

35
00:02:08,567 --> 00:02:09,147
reasons.

36
00:02:09,147 --> 00:02:12,450
The first reason is I know you guys come from all over the country and all over the world,

37
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:15,532
and I want to make sure the tools I give you today are going to be applicable to what you

38
00:02:15,532 --> 00:02:16,673
do.

39
00:02:16,673 --> 00:02:21,416
And the other reason is, quite frankly, right now the FTC is the major enforcement entity

40
00:02:21,416 --> 00:02:25,099
in the United States, and so that's the most relevant in terms of figuring out what your

41
00:02:25,099 --> 00:02:26,640
risks are and how to avoid them.

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,903
So there's going to be three parts to my presentation.

43
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:34,398
The first thing I'm going to talk about is when you need a disclosure, when you have

44
00:02:34,398 --> 00:02:34,978
to do anything at all.

45
00:02:34,978 --> 00:02:40,263
Every post on social media doesn't need a disclosure or a disclaimer, and we're going

46
00:02:40,263 --> 00:02:42,505
to talk about what posts do and what don't.

47
00:02:42,505 --> 00:02:48,670
And in the second part of the presentation, we're going to talk about what those disclosures

48
00:02:48,670 --> 00:02:49,771
look like.

49
00:02:49,771 --> 00:02:53,875
How do you let people know that there's a connection between you and the influencer?

50
00:02:53,875 --> 00:02:57,858
And in the third part of today's presentation, we're going to talk about what you do when

51
00:02:57,858 --> 00:02:58,218
you mess up.

52
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,580
Because a fact of life is your influencers aren't always going to have the disclosures

53
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:04,521
they need to have.

54
00:03:04,521 --> 00:03:06,461
And so we'll talk about what you do in that situation.

55
00:03:06,461 --> 00:03:16,824
I want to be clear when I say social media endorsements that I mean both explicit and

56
00:03:16,824 --> 00:03:18,004
implicit endorsements.

57
00:03:19,117 --> 00:03:21,137
We kind of know what an explicit endorsement is, right?

58
00:03:21,137 --> 00:03:23,438
That someone creating a video and putting it online

59
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,258
and saying, this is the best game I've played in 12 months.

60
00:03:26,258 --> 00:03:28,399
But we're also talking about implicit endorsements.

61
00:03:28,399 --> 00:03:30,079
Think about the e-sports player

62
00:03:30,079 --> 00:03:31,620
who wears their HyperX headphones.

63
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,401
I already said this covers any person

64
00:03:34,401 --> 00:03:36,541
from your grandmother to Drake.

65
00:03:36,541 --> 00:03:37,921
I mean, it's about any product or service.

66
00:03:37,921 --> 00:03:40,462
We'll be talking about games today for an obvious reason.

67
00:03:40,462 --> 00:03:43,603
But to the extent your company also is in other industries,

68
00:03:43,603 --> 00:03:46,564
you're also creating movies, you're in other spaces,

69
00:03:46,564 --> 00:03:47,744
these rules apply there too.

70
00:03:49,677 --> 00:03:52,099
Okay, so let's start with the core rule.

71
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:56,001
So the FTC has thousands of pages of guidance,

72
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:58,122
but it all really comes from this guy here on the board

73
00:03:58,122 --> 00:03:59,423
that I put up in four colors.

74
00:03:59,423 --> 00:04:02,645
It's this rule, it's if there's a connection

75
00:04:02,645 --> 00:04:04,506
between an endorser and the marketer

76
00:04:04,506 --> 00:04:05,927
that consumers would not expect,

77
00:04:05,927 --> 00:04:09,970
and it would affect how consumers evaluate the endorsement,

78
00:04:09,970 --> 00:04:11,811
that connection should be fully disclosed.

79
00:04:13,137 --> 00:04:16,061
The first three colors up there, the yellow, the blue, and the red.

80
00:04:16,061 --> 00:04:17,964
When all three of those are met, then you

81
00:04:17,964 --> 00:04:19,526
have what's called a material connection.

82
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,068
That'll be the first part of my presentation.

83
00:04:21,068 --> 00:04:23,752
What a material connection means, you'll

84
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:26,075
hear me say it again and again in the presentation,

85
00:04:26,075 --> 00:04:28,058
but that's just any connection that needs to be disclosed.

86
00:04:30,035 --> 00:04:32,857
the the green up there is then what you have to do if there's a material

87
00:04:32,857 --> 00:04:35,319
connection which is fully disclosed and we'll talk about how to do that

88
00:04:35,319 --> 00:04:38,841
and then I already told you in the last part of this presentation we'll get into

89
00:04:38,841 --> 00:04:42,564
how to make sure your influencers are doing their job or as an influencer what

90
00:04:42,564 --> 00:04:43,685
to do if you mess up

91
00:04:43,685 --> 00:04:47,247
if you take nothing else away from today's presentation

92
00:04:47,247 --> 00:04:50,170
here's what today means for you

93
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:52,511
if you're a social media influencer

94
00:04:52,511 --> 00:04:57,455
and you create content related to a game that has either paid you to create that

95
00:04:57,455 --> 00:04:57,755
content

96
00:04:58,688 --> 00:05:02,031
or if it's otherwise established a connection with you,

97
00:05:02,031 --> 00:05:03,451
you need to include a disclosure.

98
00:05:03,451 --> 00:05:05,973
You need to let your followers know that you have that connection.

99
00:05:05,973 --> 00:05:10,916
On the flip side, if you're a publisher, or you're a game developer,

100
00:05:10,916 --> 00:05:16,279
and you hire an influencer to create content for your game,

101
00:05:16,279 --> 00:05:19,061
you need to give your influencer guidance

102
00:05:19,061 --> 00:05:20,142
on how to properly disclose,

103
00:05:20,142 --> 00:05:22,963
and you need to make sure they're doing it. You need to monitor.

104
00:05:22,963 --> 00:05:24,004
So let's start with a real-world example.

105
00:05:29,257 --> 00:05:31,377
This is Syndicate.

106
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:33,158
I'm not sure I'm going to do the voice correctly,

107
00:05:33,158 --> 00:05:33,838
but I'll give it a try.

108
00:05:33,838 --> 00:05:39,060
He tweets out, brah, I've won like $8,000 worth of CSGO skins

109
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,840
today on CSGO Lotto.

110
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,341
I can't even believe it.

111
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:46,442
Now, Syndicate's still under investigation for some

112
00:05:46,442 --> 00:05:47,702
potential gambling violations.

113
00:05:47,702 --> 00:05:50,963
But he's already gotten in trouble for this tweet.

114
00:05:50,963 --> 00:05:53,424
And it wasn't because the tweet was endorsing gambling,

115
00:05:53,424 --> 00:05:54,825
although that's another problem.

116
00:05:56,105 --> 00:06:00,366
The problem of this tweet really is that last phrase there,

117
00:06:00,366 --> 00:06:01,787
I can't even believe it.

118
00:06:01,787 --> 00:06:03,607
And the problem is, it's a little difficult to believe

119
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:07,129
he couldn't believe it because he was running the site.

120
00:06:07,129 --> 00:06:08,089
Right?

121
00:06:08,089 --> 00:06:09,950
He went on his own site and won a bunch of money,

122
00:06:09,950 --> 00:06:11,450
what a surprise.

123
00:06:11,450 --> 00:06:15,412
And so the FTC came after him and entered into a settlement

124
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:18,033
with him because he didn't disclose that he was connected

125
00:06:18,033 --> 00:06:19,853
to the site, that he was the owner of the site.

126
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,663
So one situation in which you'll have one of those material connections

127
00:06:24,663 --> 00:06:26,965
is you own the company, or you make the game.

128
00:06:26,965 --> 00:06:28,927
Right? I mean, that's real simple,

129
00:06:28,927 --> 00:06:31,309
but that, if you have those connections,

130
00:06:31,309 --> 00:06:32,990
that needs to be clear to your users.

131
00:06:32,990 --> 00:06:34,992
Okay.

132
00:06:34,992 --> 00:06:37,074
Throughout today's presentation,

133
00:06:37,074 --> 00:06:38,615
I'm gonna be going through a hypothetical,

134
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:42,718
so that we can cover lots of different situations you might encounter.

135
00:06:42,718 --> 00:06:43,379
And in my hypothetical,

136
00:06:43,379 --> 00:06:45,921
we have a game developer, ShadyCorp,

137
00:06:45,921 --> 00:06:47,523
and I call him that because, as you'll see,

138
00:06:47,523 --> 00:06:49,184
some of the things they do are a little shady.

139
00:06:50,665 --> 00:06:53,486
to make it simple they have released a game called drawn out chess

140
00:06:53,486 --> 00:06:56,508
this is a classic game of chess

141
00:06:56,508 --> 00:06:58,249
but they have skins for it that's how they monetize

142
00:06:58,249 --> 00:07:01,011
they sell what they call chess sets

143
00:07:01,011 --> 00:07:05,173
and that's how they make their money it's for pc and mobile

144
00:07:05,173 --> 00:07:07,935
and they've just launched their game and they're going to engage in a marketing

145
00:07:07,935 --> 00:07:08,855
campaign

146
00:07:08,855 --> 00:07:11,797
and we're gonna talk about different practices they engage in

147
00:07:11,797 --> 00:07:13,738
and which require disclosure and which don't

148
00:07:15,552 --> 00:07:17,154
Okay, so here's what ShadyCorp does.

149
00:07:17,154 --> 00:07:19,737
The first thing they do is they go on Twitter,

150
00:07:19,737 --> 00:07:21,679
on their official corporate Twitter account,

151
00:07:21,679 --> 00:07:23,000
and they post about the game.

152
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,623
Can they do that?

153
00:07:25,623 --> 00:07:28,546
The answer is yeah, they can do that,

154
00:07:28,546 --> 00:07:30,508
and they don't need a disclosure.

155
00:07:30,508 --> 00:07:32,129
That might seem like it's contradictory

156
00:07:32,129 --> 00:07:33,991
with what I just put up on the board about Syndicate,

157
00:07:33,991 --> 00:07:36,113
because he went and posted about his company,

158
00:07:36,113 --> 00:07:37,275
and he needed a disclosure.

159
00:07:38,418 --> 00:07:41,819
The difference is this is an official corporate account.

160
00:07:41,819 --> 00:07:46,601
And at least in my hypothetical, I'm assuming that's an account

161
00:07:46,601 --> 00:07:48,422
that has had lots of tweets about the company,

162
00:07:48,422 --> 00:07:51,043
that has a handle that is clearly from the company.

163
00:07:51,043 --> 00:07:55,245
And so users are going to understand that the game developer is

164
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:56,966
sending out this tweet.

165
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,027
And as long as consumers would already understand that,

166
00:07:59,027 --> 00:07:59,887
you don't need a disclosure.

167
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:06,833
So in our next example, the CEO then goes home that day,

168
00:08:06,833 --> 00:08:09,535
and he posts on his YouTube channel

169
00:08:09,535 --> 00:08:12,456
a video of him playing the game.

170
00:08:12,456 --> 00:08:14,517
Does he need a disclosure?

171
00:08:14,517 --> 00:08:15,858
Maybe.

172
00:08:15,858 --> 00:08:17,299
And I say maybe because it depends

173
00:08:17,299 --> 00:08:18,540
what his channel looks like.

174
00:08:19,302 --> 00:08:22,363
if he just happens to really be into strategy games

175
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:26,266
and has a channel of all sorts of games from all sorts of developers

176
00:08:26,266 --> 00:08:29,128
and he uses an alias that doesn't make it clear that he's the CEO of this

177
00:08:29,128 --> 00:08:30,148
company

178
00:08:30,148 --> 00:08:32,310
then yeah, he's gotta let

179
00:08:32,310 --> 00:08:35,892
his followers know that he's the CEO of ShadyCorp when he posts that video

180
00:08:36,712 --> 00:08:40,075
But if it's clear from his YouTube channel, if it's like the Twitter account,

181
00:08:40,075 --> 00:08:42,957
where it's clear that it's from the company, then he doesn't need a disclosure,

182
00:08:42,957 --> 00:08:45,058
because consumers already know.

183
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,440
If we go back to this colorful slide here, right, that blue part,

184
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:50,562
that consumers wouldn't expect.

185
00:08:50,562 --> 00:08:53,924
So if consumers already expect there's a connection between you

186
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:56,666
and the game or the company you're tweeting about,

187
00:08:56,666 --> 00:08:58,267
you don't have to worry.

188
00:08:58,267 --> 00:09:00,448
You're done. You don't need to worry about any of the rest of these rules.

189
00:09:02,455 --> 00:09:04,379
Okay, so what about the third thing here?

190
00:09:04,379 --> 00:09:06,102
This is something obviously a lot of games do.

191
00:09:06,102 --> 00:09:09,369
You release your game, and you send it to some websites

192
00:09:09,369 --> 00:09:11,333
that review games, professional critics.

193
00:09:11,333 --> 00:09:14,799
Do professional critics have to have a disclosure?

194
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:19,148
The answer there is no, and it's for the same reason.

195
00:09:19,148 --> 00:09:22,469
It's that consumers assume that when a critic reviews a product,

196
00:09:22,469 --> 00:09:25,910
whether it's a movie critic, or a book critic, or a video game critic,

197
00:09:25,910 --> 00:09:27,570
they are receiving that product for free.

198
00:09:27,570 --> 00:09:30,771
And because consumers expect that, those websites

199
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,071
don't have to post disclosures.

200
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,592
In practice, they often do, but they don't have to.

201
00:09:34,592 --> 00:09:38,512
But what about doing something very similar?

202
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:41,433
Sending free copies of your game to a bunch of Twitch streamers?

203
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,693
The answer there is yes.

204
00:09:44,447 --> 00:09:48,008
Those streamers have to disclose they got the game for free.

205
00:09:48,008 --> 00:09:49,689
Or I shouldn't say have to. I said I was gonna try

206
00:09:49,689 --> 00:09:52,870
and avoid saying you had to do things. So I'd say

207
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,091
there's a risk that the FTC will come knocking

208
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:57,952
if those streamers don't include a disclosure.

209
00:09:57,952 --> 00:10:01,914
We'll talk later about what that disclosure has to look like.

210
00:10:01,914 --> 00:10:07,457
Okay, so our takeaways are that social media posts

211
00:10:07,457 --> 00:10:10,018
clearly from a product's creator don't need a disclosure.

212
00:10:11,528 --> 00:10:14,831
The second takeaway is receiving a free copy of a game

213
00:10:14,831 --> 00:10:16,613
or anything else of value

214
00:10:16,613 --> 00:10:19,796
creates a material connection that needs to be disclosed.

215
00:10:19,796 --> 00:10:24,360
Third takeaway is professional critics don't need a disclosure,

216
00:10:24,360 --> 00:10:26,542
but then the exception to the exception

217
00:10:26,542 --> 00:10:30,546
is the FTC currently doesn't consider YouTubers or Twitch streamers to be

218
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:31,847
professional critics,

219
00:10:31,847 --> 00:10:33,649
even if they're being critics in their game stream.

220
00:10:37,808 --> 00:10:41,429
So we're going to continue hypothetical now it's maybe a couple weeks after the

221
00:10:41,429 --> 00:10:46,131
release of the game. The games had decent sales, but

222
00:10:46,131 --> 00:10:49,311
the reviews in the app store and on steam aren't doing that well.

223
00:10:49,311 --> 00:10:54,693
So shady Corp decides they're going to create an in-game prompt to ask their

224
00:10:54,693 --> 00:10:58,714
users to review their game. We see this all the time in mobile less often on PC

225
00:10:58,714 --> 00:11:00,874
and console, although it's there too.

226
00:11:00,874 --> 00:11:07,176
Their marketing team comes to them with 3 proposals for potential props.

227
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,978
and I want to walk through what the risks

228
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:11,839
in these different prompts might be

229
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:16,961
and we'll go with what, at the end, what I think is probably the best strategy.

230
00:11:16,961 --> 00:11:19,082
So the first prompt

231
00:11:19,082 --> 00:11:23,044
that they propose in starting their game is this one on the right here.

232
00:11:23,044 --> 00:11:26,466
It says, take a moment to review drawn-out chess.

233
00:11:26,466 --> 00:11:29,267
You'll unlock the exclusive ninja chess set.

234
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:31,048
And it gives two options.

235
00:11:31,048 --> 00:11:34,309
One is, no, I don't want my free skins, I don't want my free chess set.

236
00:11:34,309 --> 00:11:35,850
And the other is, yeah,

237
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:37,171
I love ninjas, let's do this.

238
00:11:38,454 --> 00:11:41,475
And if the user clicks yes, then they go to the App Store,

239
00:11:41,475 --> 00:11:44,076
and they also get the free skin.

240
00:11:44,076 --> 00:11:45,977
Now, because of the ecosystem, the game developer

241
00:11:45,977 --> 00:11:47,358
doesn't know if they actually rated it

242
00:11:47,358 --> 00:11:49,519
once they got to the App Store, but it directed them there.

243
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:52,560
And if they say no, they just keep playing the game.

244
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:55,101
So I already told you receiving a free game

245
00:11:55,101 --> 00:11:56,481
creates a material connection.

246
00:11:56,481 --> 00:11:58,822
What about receiving a free item in a game

247
00:11:58,822 --> 00:12:02,024
that you can't transfer anywhere else?

248
00:12:02,024 --> 00:12:04,525
Well, right now, the FTC's opinion

249
00:12:04,525 --> 00:12:06,285
is that creates a material connection.

250
00:12:07,452 --> 00:12:11,173
For those of you in the room who sometimes deal with gambling law

251
00:12:11,173 --> 00:12:13,393
and how to make sure you're not violating gambling law,

252
00:12:13,393 --> 00:12:14,554
this is different.

253
00:12:14,554 --> 00:12:16,994
It's a different outcome here.

254
00:12:16,994 --> 00:12:20,115
Normally in the context of games, we don't consider an in-game item

255
00:12:20,115 --> 00:12:22,516
to be something of value unless you can sell it

256
00:12:22,516 --> 00:12:23,736
on some other marketplace.

257
00:12:23,736 --> 00:12:27,537
But for the purposes of social media influence or disclosures,

258
00:12:27,537 --> 00:12:30,118
giving your player anything, including a skin that

259
00:12:30,118 --> 00:12:33,479
doesn't affect their game play, counts as something of value.

260
00:12:33,479 --> 00:12:36,940
So if Shady Corp decided to use this prompt,

261
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:42,309
They would have to make sure or at least attempt to get their consumers to

262
00:12:42,309 --> 00:12:45,110
disclose that they got a free prompt within their review.

263
00:12:45,110 --> 00:12:48,452
In practice, that's going to be really hard.

264
00:12:48,452 --> 00:12:50,813
There are ways you could do it.

265
00:12:51,863 --> 00:12:55,525
but it's difficult and expensive and difficult to monitor.

266
00:12:55,525 --> 00:13:00,347
So I don't like this as a method of trying to get more people to review your game,

267
00:13:00,347 --> 00:13:03,609
not because you can't do it, because it's really difficult to do,

268
00:13:03,609 --> 00:13:07,031
and inevitably you're going to have consumers who don't disclose

269
00:13:07,031 --> 00:13:08,691
that they got the free skin.

270
00:13:08,691 --> 00:13:10,832
So let's talk about some other examples you might use

271
00:13:10,832 --> 00:13:17,295
to increase the rating of your game or get more reviews that are lower risk.

272
00:13:18,442 --> 00:13:21,024
So first, look at the example on the left here.

273
00:13:21,024 --> 00:13:22,485
It says, enjoying drawn out chess.

274
00:13:22,485 --> 00:13:26,948
And this time, it's giving the player three options.

275
00:13:26,948 --> 00:13:29,690
First option is yes, write it now.

276
00:13:29,690 --> 00:13:31,692
That option will take them to the App Store, like in the

277
00:13:31,692 --> 00:13:32,652
previous example.

278
00:13:32,652 --> 00:13:36,315
Second option is no, send feedback.

279
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,277
What this option does is it pulls up a prompt within the

280
00:13:39,277 --> 00:13:41,919
game that the user can then write feedback.

281
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:43,441
And maybe as the developer.

282
00:13:44,567 --> 00:13:48,070
You decide to read it, maybe you don't, but for the purposes of reviews, what you're doing

283
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:50,391
is you're directing the user away from the app store.

284
00:13:50,391 --> 00:13:53,093
And then the third option is just dismiss.

285
00:13:53,093 --> 00:13:54,134
You do neither.

286
00:13:54,134 --> 00:13:57,296
This is what we call divergent prompting.

287
00:13:57,296 --> 00:14:01,219
The attempt here is to filter users who don't like your game away from the review stores,

288
00:14:01,219 --> 00:14:03,180
and users who do like your game there.

289
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:04,842
I would call this practice moderate risk.

290
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,522
It's probably better than giving your player a free in-game item

291
00:14:13,522 --> 00:14:16,103
from the purpose of enforcement.

292
00:14:16,103 --> 00:14:17,784
But it's still risky.

293
00:14:17,784 --> 00:14:20,286
And if you're going to do something like this,

294
00:14:20,286 --> 00:14:23,468
the big piece of advice I have for you is make sure you're

295
00:14:23,468 --> 00:14:26,950
being clear with your players what button does what.

296
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:31,513
So there are games where they use this, except for there

297
00:14:31,513 --> 00:14:32,373
aren't three buttons.

298
00:14:33,357 --> 00:14:35,999
there's just a rate the game and it gives the user 5 stars

299
00:14:35,999 --> 00:14:40,843
and when that user rates the game 5 stars it takes them to the app store

300
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:44,286
but when they rate it 1, 2, 3 or 4 stars it keeps them within the game ecosystem

301
00:14:44,286 --> 00:14:51,091
doing that is an area that I think is very likely to be enforced in the near future

302
00:14:51,091 --> 00:14:54,914
so if you're gonna go with this strategy on the left here, divergent prompting

303
00:14:54,914 --> 00:14:57,356
at least make clear to your players what's going on

304
00:14:57,356 --> 00:15:01,098
so that if they hate the game they can at least say yes rate it now

305
00:15:01,098 --> 00:15:02,680
because they know where that button takes them

306
00:15:04,762 --> 00:15:08,243
but as you might have guessed the solution I like best

307
00:15:08,243 --> 00:15:12,045
for trying to get your users to have more reviews and better reviews

308
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:14,506
is this third one on the right here

309
00:15:14,506 --> 00:15:17,048
so in our hypothetical this says

310
00:15:17,048 --> 00:15:19,009
uh... five game hot streak

311
00:15:19,009 --> 00:15:21,330
it's just when five chess games in a row

312
00:15:21,330 --> 00:15:25,192
take a moment to rate drawn out chess before you get back to dominating

313
00:15:25,192 --> 00:15:28,793
and then it gives the user the classic two options yeah review the game

314
00:15:28,793 --> 00:15:29,954
and no I don't want to review the game

315
00:15:31,484 --> 00:15:35,607
What this prompt is doing is we're not trying to filter out users.

316
00:15:35,607 --> 00:15:39,129
What we're doing is we're displaying the prompt at a time

317
00:15:39,129 --> 00:15:41,990
when the users are likely enjoying their experience.

318
00:15:41,990 --> 00:15:47,554
My guess is that if somebody just won five games in a row in a matchmaking

319
00:15:47,554 --> 00:15:52,577
system where it's 50-50 odds, basically, they're probably feeling pretty good.

320
00:15:52,577 --> 00:15:54,498
And so when these users go to the App Store,

321
00:15:54,498 --> 00:15:56,259
they'll probably give it higher ratings.

322
00:15:57,252 --> 00:16:00,673
but you're not being deceptive here you're not bribing your user into giving

323
00:16:00,673 --> 00:16:04,934
you a better rating you're not trying to say some users can't rank your game and

324
00:16:04,934 --> 00:16:06,774
not you're just putting the prompt

325
00:16:06,774 --> 00:16:11,576
at a time that users are likely enjoying the experience and you can work with

326
00:16:11,576 --> 00:16:15,156
your analytics people whether they're in-house or outside the game to figure

327
00:16:15,156 --> 00:16:18,017
out what's the moment in your game when players are really enjoying it

328
00:16:18,957 --> 00:16:23,138
and then just queue up that classic would you like to review this app now prompt

329
00:16:23,138 --> 00:16:27,720
then I think that's the lowest risk strategy if you're looking for a way to

330
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:30,621
increase reviews within the app store environment.

331
00:16:30,621 --> 00:16:38,284
OK so our takeaways giving compensation to users for reviewing your game even

332
00:16:38,284 --> 00:16:42,666
in game aesthetic items that cannot be traded creates one of those material

333
00:16:42,666 --> 00:16:45,867
connections so you're going to need a disclosure or it's going to be risky to

334
00:16:45,867 --> 00:16:46,847
not have a disclosure.

335
00:16:48,046 --> 00:16:52,809
Second takeaway is the FTC hasn't yet enforced against divergent prompting,

336
00:16:52,809 --> 00:16:54,510
but I would be careful if you do it.

337
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,911
If you do it, make sure you're being upfront with your players

338
00:16:56,911 --> 00:16:57,672
about what's going on.

339
00:16:57,672 --> 00:17:01,174
And then the third point is creative timing

340
00:17:01,174 --> 00:17:05,816
of when you schedule a please review my app prompt within your game

341
00:17:05,816 --> 00:17:09,619
is probably the lowest risk alternative to boost your reviews

342
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:12,580
without the FTC coming and giving you a call.

343
00:17:15,046 --> 00:17:18,468
OK. So we've talked about when you need a disclosure.

344
00:17:18,468 --> 00:17:22,391
Now what I want to talk about is what those

345
00:17:22,391 --> 00:17:26,414
disclosures look like. So we're gonna continue our hypothetical, but

346
00:17:26,414 --> 00:17:29,456
now we're gonna introduce Tina the Twitch streamer, who

347
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,918
is someone that ShadyCorp Games has hired to promote

348
00:17:32,918 --> 00:17:35,460
their game. And this is a hypothetical tweet she sends

349
00:17:35,460 --> 00:17:38,642
out. It says, I love my new pirate chess set

350
00:17:38,642 --> 00:17:41,344
in Drawn Out Chess. I'll be streaming it here

351
00:17:41,344 --> 00:17:44,066
and gives a link. And then she has some hashtags.

352
00:17:44,803 --> 00:17:47,985
says hashtag are she's a pirate

353
00:17:47,985 --> 00:17:50,607
hashtag old school gamer

354
00:17:50,607 --> 00:17:52,428
hashtag partner

355
00:17:52,428 --> 00:17:55,070
and hashtag streaming

356
00:17:55,070 --> 00:17:57,131
so it wasn't clear in this is purposefully not

357
00:17:57,131 --> 00:17:59,593
a clear slide the attempted disclosure

358
00:17:59,593 --> 00:18:01,594
is hashtag partner

359
00:18:01,594 --> 00:18:03,815
what Tina is saying is she's partnered with the game

360
00:18:03,815 --> 00:18:05,777
and she's at least attempting to let

361
00:18:05,777 --> 00:18:09,039
her audience know that and she includes this hashtag

362
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:11,340
so let's talk about what's OK and what's wrong here

363
00:18:13,147 --> 00:18:18,730
So first thing that I want to make clear is there's no magic sentence of legalese

364
00:18:18,730 --> 00:18:21,592
that you should say when you're making a disclosure.

365
00:18:21,592 --> 00:18:27,675
You can disclose in any format, and yes, that includes hashtags.

366
00:18:27,675 --> 00:18:30,897
So there's no rule that says your disclosure can't be in a hashtag.

367
00:18:30,897 --> 00:18:35,680
Problem here is that partner's a little ambiguous.

368
00:18:37,268 --> 00:18:40,350
And when the FTC has looked at cases like this, they've said,

369
00:18:40,350 --> 00:18:42,511
we don't think your audience really knows what partner is.

370
00:18:42,511 --> 00:18:45,693
And they've given some suggestions for better

371
00:18:45,693 --> 00:18:47,714
hashtags you might use that are a little bit clearer.

372
00:18:47,714 --> 00:18:53,237
So the FTC's favorite hashtag is hashtag ad, pound symbol

373
00:18:53,237 --> 00:18:55,098
A-D. It's really short.

374
00:18:55,098 --> 00:18:57,639
It only takes up three characters.

375
00:18:57,639 --> 00:18:59,400
And it's very clear what's going on.

376
00:18:59,400 --> 00:19:03,703
Marketing teams don't always like hashtag ads so much.

377
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,706
It seems a little hard, right?

378
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:09,628
It's a little in your face, sort of breaks the narrative

379
00:19:09,628 --> 00:19:11,630
that the influencer is trying to create,

380
00:19:11,630 --> 00:19:13,651
that they actually support the product.

381
00:19:13,651 --> 00:19:17,753
So some other options are hashtag sponsored,

382
00:19:17,753 --> 00:19:21,956
hashtag the company's name with an underscore partner,

383
00:19:21,956 --> 00:19:25,578
or the company's name with an underscore ambassador.

384
00:19:25,578 --> 00:19:27,799
They don't like partner,

385
00:19:27,799 --> 00:19:29,480
but if you put your company's name in front of it,

386
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,442
and then an underscore and then partner, they like that.

387
00:19:33,137 --> 00:19:36,400
and they call that disclosure sufficient, which means be very low risk.

388
00:19:36,400 --> 00:19:42,685
The other problem with this hypothetical is that the hashtag is in the middle of a bunch

389
00:19:42,685 --> 00:19:47,489
of hashtags at the end, what the FTC refers to as being lost in a sea of hashtags.

390
00:19:47,489 --> 00:19:53,674
And the thought is that when a user sees this, they'll probably read the text, and they might

391
00:19:53,674 --> 00:19:55,795
just read none of the hashtags because there's so many of them.

392
00:19:57,103 --> 00:20:00,264
So if you're going to make a disclosure through a hashtag,

393
00:20:00,264 --> 00:20:02,224
put your hashtag at the front,

394
00:20:02,224 --> 00:20:05,385
and ideally don't have more than two other hashtags after it.

395
00:20:05,385 --> 00:20:09,406
More hashtags you have, the greater risk you have.

396
00:20:09,406 --> 00:20:14,988
So our takeaways are disclosures can take many forms,

397
00:20:14,988 --> 00:20:16,508
even hashtags.

398
00:20:18,089 --> 00:20:21,532
Second takeaway here is the FTC has only officially approved

399
00:20:21,532 --> 00:20:22,953
a limited number of hashtags.

400
00:20:22,953 --> 00:20:26,055
Those are hashtag ad, hashtag sponsored,

401
00:20:26,055 --> 00:20:28,457
hashtag your company's name partner,

402
00:20:28,457 --> 00:20:31,059
and hashtag your company's name underscore ambassador.

403
00:20:31,059 --> 00:20:33,641
That doesn't mean there aren't others that work.

404
00:20:33,641 --> 00:20:36,803
That just means that right now there have been cases

405
00:20:36,803 --> 00:20:39,165
where they've said those all definitely work.

406
00:20:39,165 --> 00:20:41,087
So if you use those, very low risk.

407
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,130
On the flip side, the FTC has a bunch of hashtags

408
00:20:45,130 --> 00:20:46,351
they really don't like.

409
00:20:47,138 --> 00:20:48,359
And so I wouldn't use any of these,

410
00:20:48,359 --> 00:20:50,541
because then you're almost tempting the FTC

411
00:20:50,541 --> 00:20:52,022
to come after you.

412
00:20:52,022 --> 00:20:55,944
Those hashtags are hashtag SP, hashtag spawn,

413
00:20:55,944 --> 00:20:59,007
hashtag collab, hashtag partner,

414
00:20:59,007 --> 00:21:01,388
hashtag consultant, hashtag ambassador,

415
00:21:01,388 --> 00:21:04,410
and this one, which I think is a little surprising,

416
00:21:04,410 --> 00:21:07,893
hashtag thank you underscore, and then the company's name.

417
00:21:07,893 --> 00:21:10,134
The reason they don't like that last one

418
00:21:10,134 --> 00:21:12,356
is their thought is maybe the influencer

419
00:21:12,356 --> 00:21:14,177
bought the game themselves,

420
00:21:14,177 --> 00:21:15,838
and they just really liked the game.

421
00:21:16,848 --> 00:21:19,209
you know they've been playing surviving mars all weekend

422
00:21:19,209 --> 00:21:21,649
and they just really want to thank paradox even

423
00:21:21,649 --> 00:21:26,010
though they don't have a relationship with them.

424
00:21:26,010 --> 00:21:29,591
And the final takeaway here is that you have

425
00:21:29,591 --> 00:21:31,572
to have your disclosures not in a sea of

426
00:21:31,572 --> 00:21:35,353
hash tags. So if you're gonna use a hash

427
00:21:35,353 --> 00:21:38,014
tag, ideally not more than three hash tags and

428
00:21:38,014 --> 00:21:41,635
make it the first hash tag in the list.

429
00:21:41,635 --> 00:21:43,615
OK. So now we're gonna go back to a

430
00:21:43,615 --> 00:21:44,796
real world example here.

431
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:46,996
This is PewDiePie.

432
00:21:46,996 --> 00:21:51,560
This is the actual YouTube page you get to for his video that was sponsored by Warner Brothers.

433
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:53,962
And when you go to PewDiePie's page,

434
00:21:53,962 --> 00:21:56,785
this is what it looks like.

435
00:21:56,785 --> 00:22:00,308
And like most YouTube videos, below it there's a Show More button, which brings up

436
00:22:00,308 --> 00:22:03,151
this incredibly readable block of text.

437
00:22:03,151 --> 00:22:04,613
Within that block of text,

438
00:22:04,613 --> 00:22:05,934
there's a disclosure.

439
00:22:05,934 --> 00:22:08,797
It says this video was sponsored by Warner Brothers.

440
00:22:08,797 --> 00:22:10,738
It's misspelled, but it's a disclosure.

441
00:22:11,857 --> 00:22:16,000
And at the beginning of his video, he says,

442
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,942
I had the opportunity to check out the demo of this game at Gamescom.

443
00:22:19,942 --> 00:22:24,986
The FTC came after Warner Brothers for not giving sufficient advice

444
00:22:24,986 --> 00:22:26,166
on how to disclose here.

445
00:22:26,166 --> 00:22:28,668
And what was their issue?

446
00:22:28,668 --> 00:22:35,032
Their big issue here was that users had to click a button in order

447
00:22:35,032 --> 00:22:35,832
to see the disclosure.

448
00:22:35,832 --> 00:22:38,214
It's what they call below the fold.

449
00:22:39,633 --> 00:22:41,295
And quite frankly, they're right.

450
00:22:41,295 --> 00:22:45,477
Most users don't click the See More button when they go to a

451
00:22:45,477 --> 00:22:47,619
YouTube page and look at the description.

452
00:22:47,619 --> 00:22:49,680
This also applies in other contexts.

453
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,382
Think about something like Instagram, where if you have

454
00:22:52,382 --> 00:22:54,323
too many sentences, it gets cut off.

455
00:22:54,323 --> 00:22:58,546
That means for those platforms, your disclosure

456
00:22:58,546 --> 00:23:01,628
needs to be in those first four sentences, so users don't

457
00:23:01,628 --> 00:23:02,589
have to click a button.

458
00:23:03,818 --> 00:23:06,080
It also means it's going to be very risky if you try and

459
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:09,182
have your disclosures in, say, your terms of use,

460
00:23:09,182 --> 00:23:11,164
and just hope your users go and click to read it.

461
00:23:11,164 --> 00:23:13,205
They need to be visible.

462
00:23:13,205 --> 00:23:14,506
They need to be above the fold.

463
00:23:14,506 --> 00:23:17,448
Other thing I want to point out about this case is,

464
00:23:17,448 --> 00:23:20,890
allegedly, I don't know how much he was actually paid,

465
00:23:20,890 --> 00:23:23,512
but according to the FTC, PewDiePie was paid about

466
00:23:23,512 --> 00:23:24,453
$20,000 for this video.

467
00:23:24,453 --> 00:23:28,395
And even though they complained about it, in the

468
00:23:28,395 --> 00:23:30,937
final settlement, there was no mention of disclosure for

469
00:23:30,937 --> 00:23:31,698
the amount of money.

470
00:23:32,279 --> 00:23:35,682
And we've consistently seen that in future cases going forward.

471
00:23:35,682 --> 00:23:40,386
So if you were worried that you were paying your influencer a lot of money,

472
00:23:40,386 --> 00:23:43,468
or giving them a lot of free product, and that they were going to have to disclose that,

473
00:23:43,468 --> 00:23:45,950
and that might cause some backlash in your community,

474
00:23:45,950 --> 00:23:49,153
or your competitors might start finding out what your marketing spend was,

475
00:23:49,153 --> 00:23:52,195
don't worry. You never have to say how much you paid someone.

476
00:23:52,195 --> 00:23:55,078
You have to make it clear that it's sponsored, or that you paid them,

477
00:23:55,078 --> 00:23:56,939
but you never have to tell them how much.

478
00:23:59,769 --> 00:24:04,291
So I put up in case you want to look at it. I don't think it's particularly readable,

479
00:24:04,291 --> 00:24:09,335
but basically what that paragraph says is what I talked about for the above the fold.

480
00:24:09,335 --> 00:24:13,337
Don't make your users click a button to go see your disclosure.

481
00:24:13,337 --> 00:24:18,340
Second bullet up there is what I just said. You don't worry.

482
00:24:18,340 --> 00:24:22,883
You don't have to disclose the amount you have paid your influencers if you go and hire them.

483
00:24:22,883 --> 00:24:28,226
Okay, so we're going to go back to our hypothetical now.

484
00:24:29,172 --> 00:24:33,874
And now Tina, the Twitch streamer, is actually running a Twitch stream.

485
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:37,295
And I want to talk about what that disclosure looks like on Twitch.

486
00:24:37,295 --> 00:24:42,157
It's a little easier to think about in the context of something written,

487
00:24:42,157 --> 00:24:44,178
because you have time to prepare it.

488
00:24:44,178 --> 00:24:46,299
And as a developer or a studio, you can actually

489
00:24:46,299 --> 00:24:49,280
send your influencer the exact text you want them to use.

490
00:24:49,280 --> 00:24:53,141
Of course, in the context of Twitch, it's live.

491
00:24:53,141 --> 00:24:53,822
The user's streaming.

492
00:24:53,822 --> 00:24:56,643
And so let's talk about how you would make that disclosure.

493
00:24:58,328 --> 00:25:01,929
So the first thing is the lowest risk practice.

494
00:25:01,929 --> 00:25:04,369
It's that in the beginning of any video,

495
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:07,070
whether that's a fixed length video like YouTube,

496
00:25:07,070 --> 00:25:09,310
or that's a Twitch stream,

497
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:12,531
at the very beginning you wanna have both a text-based

498
00:25:12,531 --> 00:25:14,311
and an audible disclosure,

499
00:25:14,311 --> 00:25:19,592
at least if your video has audible content.

500
00:25:19,592 --> 00:25:23,133
In addition to that first disclosure,

501
00:25:23,133 --> 00:25:25,493
if you have a video that isn't fixed length,

502
00:25:25,493 --> 00:25:27,373
think about a live stream,

503
00:25:28,434 --> 00:25:32,015
you have two options. You can either have periodic

504
00:25:32,015 --> 00:25:35,157
disclosures, or you can have constant disclosures.

505
00:25:35,157 --> 00:25:38,578
Sort of self-explanatory, although let's talk about it.

506
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:43,880
A periodic disclosure means every once in a while

507
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,861
you have a disclosure. And you're probably thinking right

508
00:25:46,861 --> 00:25:49,502
now, well, how often is that? Man, that's a

509
00:25:49,502 --> 00:25:53,063
great question. Been waiting for years for the FTC

510
00:25:53,063 --> 00:25:54,504
to tell us, and they still haven't, so I

511
00:25:54,504 --> 00:25:55,544
have two answers for you.

512
00:25:56,511 --> 00:26:00,213
First is the complicated, but probably the best answer,

513
00:26:00,213 --> 00:26:03,816
which is every time you have a churn of more than 50%,

514
00:26:03,816 --> 00:26:06,818
that means you're at a point where most of the people

515
00:26:06,818 --> 00:26:08,779
watching your stream weren't watching it

516
00:26:08,779 --> 00:26:11,441
the last time you disclosed, you should disclose again.

517
00:26:11,441 --> 00:26:15,424
Now in practice, that's really difficult to figure out.

518
00:26:15,424 --> 00:26:17,806
You don't necessarily have the live analytics,

519
00:26:17,806 --> 00:26:20,087
and even if you do have historical analytics,

520
00:26:20,087 --> 00:26:21,348
they might change from time to time.

521
00:26:21,348 --> 00:26:25,491
So the short answer I'm gonna give you is once an hour.

522
00:26:27,247 --> 00:26:30,071
that answer may change in the future

523
00:26:30,071 --> 00:26:32,875
but based on what i've seen in based on my discussions

524
00:26:32,875 --> 00:26:33,857
in the job that i have

525
00:26:33,857 --> 00:26:37,943
i think once an hour is something i would be comfortable defending

526
00:26:37,943 --> 00:26:39,786
i think that's very low risk

527
00:26:42,785 --> 00:26:46,427
Another strategy I have when you're working with influencers

528
00:26:46,427 --> 00:26:49,288
is once an hour can seem sort of rote, right?

529
00:26:49,288 --> 00:26:51,049
In theory, you could have a timer

530
00:26:51,049 --> 00:26:52,749
and they can disclose every hour.

531
00:26:52,749 --> 00:26:55,090
But sometimes a better strategy

532
00:26:55,090 --> 00:26:57,571
is if they're playing a game that takes place in rounds.

533
00:26:57,571 --> 00:27:01,973
Think about Fortnite or PUBG or Hearthstone or StarCraft.

534
00:27:01,973 --> 00:27:03,754
They're playing a game like that,

535
00:27:03,754 --> 00:27:06,095
have them disclose every round,

536
00:27:06,095 --> 00:27:08,816
or if the rounds are short, every couple rounds

537
00:27:08,816 --> 00:27:10,557
so that they're disclosing at least once an hour.

538
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:15,811
For the moment, I think that's the lowest risk practice,

539
00:27:15,811 --> 00:27:16,891
and that may change in the future,

540
00:27:16,891 --> 00:27:20,733
but that would be my recommendation for the moment.

541
00:27:20,733 --> 00:27:21,713
Now, I said there were two options.

542
00:27:21,713 --> 00:27:24,374
There was periodic and constant.

543
00:27:24,374 --> 00:27:25,874
Constant doesn't mean your influencer

544
00:27:25,874 --> 00:27:27,875
is just there on the stream constantly saying,

545
00:27:27,875 --> 00:27:29,836
I got this game for free, I got this game for free,

546
00:27:29,836 --> 00:27:30,736
I got this game for free.

547
00:27:30,736 --> 00:27:34,518
What that means is that after the initial audible disclosure

548
00:27:34,518 --> 00:27:36,938
there's a block of text that's always on the screen.

549
00:27:38,425 --> 00:27:40,547
marketers tend not to like this

550
00:27:40,547 --> 00:27:43,710
in the game industry is really frustrating second obscure the game

551
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:45,131
itself

552
00:27:45,131 --> 00:27:48,493
so generally a periodic disclosures are better

553
00:27:48,493 --> 00:27:52,016
but where constant disclosures look work well

554
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:54,498
is when you as a company are working with an influencer

555
00:27:54,498 --> 00:27:58,181
who just can't remember to disclose

556
00:27:58,181 --> 00:27:59,422
we know those people right

557
00:27:59,422 --> 00:28:01,824
they're not being malicious they just can't remember

558
00:28:02,624 --> 00:28:04,325
and if you're working with them

559
00:28:04,325 --> 00:28:08,366
and they just keep forgetting maybe think about putting a block of text on

560
00:28:08,366 --> 00:28:11,548
the screen either above or below them

561
00:28:11,548 --> 00:28:14,929
another trick with the constant disclosures that's really frustrating

562
00:28:14,929 --> 00:28:18,071
is if those disclosures are blocked by an ad

563
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,671
then no one's going to see them

564
00:28:19,671 --> 00:28:24,393
so it can get complicated in that maybe on youtube it's fine but then you

565
00:28:24,393 --> 00:28:28,675
upload it to another platform and the ads appear below the video and it's

566
00:28:28,675 --> 00:28:29,275
obscured

567
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:34,139
But again, if you really have someone who can't remember,

568
00:28:34,139 --> 00:28:38,201
think about that as a strategy.

569
00:28:38,201 --> 00:28:40,863
So our takeaways are disclosures in videos

570
00:28:40,863 --> 00:28:45,426
should appear at the beginning of the video,

571
00:28:45,426 --> 00:28:47,588
including both an audible and a text-based disclosure

572
00:28:47,588 --> 00:28:51,390
is the lowest risk practice.

573
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:52,591
If a video is part of a stream,

574
00:28:52,591 --> 00:28:57,054
there needs to be either periodic or constant disclosures.

575
00:28:57,054 --> 00:28:59,336
FTC hasn't told us what periodic means.

576
00:29:01,703 --> 00:29:06,908
If you instead choose to use a constant disclosure, that would be a text disclaimer at the top

577
00:29:06,908 --> 00:29:10,891
or bottom, but remember, make sure your ads aren't covering it up.

578
00:29:10,891 --> 00:29:18,137
So I told you there would be three parts to today's presentation.

579
00:29:18,137 --> 00:29:25,003
I've talked to you about when you need a disclosure and about how that disclosure should look.

580
00:29:25,003 --> 00:29:27,945
So now let's talk about what happens a lot when you mess up.

581
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:32,318
or one of your influencers that you're hiring

582
00:29:32,318 --> 00:29:33,559
forgets to include the disclosure.

583
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:37,041
Nowadays, it's not uncommon to work with 500 influencers,

584
00:29:37,041 --> 00:29:40,624
and one of them's probably not gonna do their job.

585
00:29:40,624 --> 00:29:44,246
So what I've put up on the screen here is a real-life case.

586
00:29:44,246 --> 00:29:47,729
This is actually one of the earliest FTC enforcement cases,

587
00:29:47,729 --> 00:29:50,171
and it was Microsoft's promotion of the Xbox One.

588
00:29:50,171 --> 00:29:52,712
And so what Microsoft did is they went

589
00:29:52,712 --> 00:29:55,935
and they hired Starcom MediaVest.

590
00:29:57,276 --> 00:29:59,197
to run a marketing campaign.

591
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:02,598
And they, in turn, hired Machinima to recruit some influencers to promote the Xbox One.

592
00:30:02,598 --> 00:30:04,958
And then Machinima

593
00:30:04,958 --> 00:30:07,779
paid influencers to post videos about the Xbox One.

594
00:30:07,779 --> 00:30:16,082
And some of those influencers didn't include a disclosure, and the FTC did an investigation.

595
00:30:16,082 --> 00:30:19,743
But Microsoft didn't end up getting in trouble.

596
00:30:19,743 --> 00:30:20,683
So let's talk about why.

597
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:25,142
you might be tempted to think they didn't get in trouble

598
00:30:25,142 --> 00:30:27,363
because they're all the way up the chain.

599
00:30:27,363 --> 00:30:28,943
And that's not the right answer.

600
00:30:28,943 --> 00:30:32,445
You are welcome to delegate your marketing

601
00:30:32,445 --> 00:30:34,465
and delegate this responsibility,

602
00:30:34,465 --> 00:30:36,126
but that isn't a get-out-of-jail-free card.

603
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:39,387
It's your obligation

604
00:30:39,387 --> 00:30:41,628
as the company that initiates the spend,

605
00:30:41,628 --> 00:30:43,549
so Microsoft in this example,

606
00:30:43,549 --> 00:30:46,130
to make sure those influencers receive the guidelines

607
00:30:46,130 --> 00:30:48,951
and actually put them up.

608
00:30:48,951 --> 00:30:51,212
But Microsoft didn't get in trouble here for two reasons.

609
00:30:52,028 --> 00:30:58,749
One, they had a robust compliance program where they sent each influencer guidelines

610
00:30:58,749 --> 00:31:01,270
on how they need to disclose.

611
00:31:01,270 --> 00:31:06,371
And not only did they do that, they monitored the influencers and they noticed that some

612
00:31:06,371 --> 00:31:07,071
weren't disclosing.

613
00:31:07,071 --> 00:31:12,772
And once they noticed some weren't disclosing, they did a broader campaign, figured out all

614
00:31:12,772 --> 00:31:15,913
the influencers who hadn't disclosed, and then they did the really important thing here,

615
00:31:15,913 --> 00:31:16,793
they made them fix it.

616
00:31:16,793 --> 00:31:20,254
They went to their influencers and said, either take down the video or add a disclosure.

617
00:31:21,722 --> 00:31:24,804
So you're not always going to get in trouble here

618
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:29,028
as a company just because you have one influencer who makes a mistake.

619
00:31:29,028 --> 00:31:32,471
The key is that there should be some monitoring

620
00:31:32,471 --> 00:31:36,834
of what your influences are doing and then correcting the issues when you find them.

621
00:31:36,834 --> 00:31:40,677
I'd also like to point out monitoring doesn't mean you have to look at every single post.

622
00:31:40,677 --> 00:31:47,023
You can do that and that's probably the lowest risk strategy.

623
00:31:47,023 --> 00:31:47,703
But you don't have to.

624
00:31:48,793 --> 00:31:52,436
particularly if you have an ongoing influencer who's, you know, creating content all the

625
00:31:52,436 --> 00:31:56,338
time, maybe once a week, maybe once every two weeks, check in, and then if you see a

626
00:31:56,338 --> 00:31:59,960
problem with an influencer, go back and look at all the rest of their posts.

627
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:07,784
So our takeaways here are regular, robust monitoring is a best practice.

628
00:32:07,784 --> 00:32:12,747
If a non-compliant post or video is identified, that should be corrected, either by adding

629
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:15,208
the correct disclosure or taking that content down.

630
00:32:16,981 --> 00:32:20,184
you're welcome to delegate marketing or monitoring

631
00:32:20,184 --> 00:32:23,027
but that delegation is neither a defense

632
00:32:23,027 --> 00:32:23,667
nor an excuse right

633
00:32:23,667 --> 00:32:24,868
you don't have to do it

634
00:32:24,868 --> 00:32:28,732
but if you do do it you still have to watch out for yourself

635
00:32:29,961 --> 00:32:32,602
And finally, I've put up an FTC recommendation here

636
00:32:32,602 --> 00:32:35,363
that I don't know how viable it is in practice

637
00:32:35,363 --> 00:32:38,544
when you're working with influencers in the real world,

638
00:32:38,544 --> 00:32:41,025
but is at least a creative recommendation from the FTC.

639
00:32:41,025 --> 00:32:44,926
And their advice is don't pay your influencers

640
00:32:44,926 --> 00:32:46,667
until you've reviewed their post.

641
00:32:46,667 --> 00:32:48,628
And if their posts don't have the correct disclosure,

642
00:32:48,628 --> 00:32:49,468
then they don't get paid.

643
00:32:49,468 --> 00:32:53,089
Okay, that's probably a really good way

644
00:32:53,089 --> 00:32:54,850
to make sure your influencers do their job

645
00:32:54,850 --> 00:32:56,871
and include an accurate disclosure.

646
00:32:57,969 --> 00:33:01,471
not sure how well it would work in the context of actually working with influencers,

647
00:33:01,471 --> 00:33:07,916
but it's a strategy to consider, and if you've had an influencer who keeps forgetting to include a disclosure,

648
00:33:07,916 --> 00:33:10,117
maybe a strategy you want to think about,

649
00:33:10,117 --> 00:33:13,700
in terms of how do I get this particular influencer who I've had problems with

650
00:33:13,700 --> 00:33:16,381
to keep promoting my game but include that disclosure I've asked them to.

651
00:33:16,381 --> 00:33:17,682
So let's take a look about what that looks like in practice.

652
00:33:23,340 --> 00:33:25,401
because it's sort of easy in the abstract to think,

653
00:33:25,401 --> 00:33:29,242
oh yeah, I monitor and when I see something wrong, I correct it.

654
00:33:29,242 --> 00:33:34,725
But sometimes you get posts that, eh, they're a little on the edge.

655
00:33:34,725 --> 00:33:36,125
So we're going back to our hypothetical here,

656
00:33:36,125 --> 00:33:39,046
but we're going to flash forward another two or three months.

657
00:33:39,046 --> 00:33:41,047
So if you remember from earlier in our presentation,

658
00:33:41,047 --> 00:33:44,329
Tina was paid some money to send out some tweets,

659
00:33:44,329 --> 00:33:47,930
to do some Twitch streams, to create some YouTube videos.

660
00:33:47,930 --> 00:33:50,491
She was paid that money over a two-week period.

661
00:33:50,491 --> 00:33:51,592
She fulfilled her contract.

662
00:33:51,592 --> 00:33:51,932
She's done.

663
00:33:53,337 --> 00:33:55,458
And because ShadyCorp has really good monitoring,

664
00:33:55,458 --> 00:33:58,720
they noticed four months later, she sends out this Instagram.

665
00:33:58,720 --> 00:34:01,062
Right, and so I know the text is a little small,

666
00:34:01,062 --> 00:34:02,322
but it says at the bottom there,

667
00:34:02,322 --> 00:34:05,784
is looks like someone just leaked the pawn skin

668
00:34:05,784 --> 00:34:09,066
in Drawn Out Chess' upcoming Russian-themed chess set.

669
00:34:09,066 --> 00:34:10,047
So what's Tina doing here?

670
00:34:10,047 --> 00:34:11,908
She's making a political commentary, right?

671
00:34:18,214 --> 00:34:21,696
and so your monitor comes to you and here she is like

672
00:34:21,696 --> 00:34:23,237
man I don't know what to do

673
00:34:23,237 --> 00:34:25,178
because we paid her but that was like

674
00:34:25,178 --> 00:34:29,141
three or four months ago, is she still an influencer for us?

675
00:34:29,141 --> 00:34:33,884
this post is about our game but it's not really about our game

676
00:34:33,884 --> 00:34:37,105
do we have to tell her she has to go put up a disclosure?

677
00:34:37,105 --> 00:34:41,628
so why don't we break down those rules

678
00:34:41,628 --> 00:34:42,929
so first the simple one

679
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:46,186
everything I've talked about today

680
00:34:46,186 --> 00:34:49,088
applies to what we call commercial speech

681
00:34:49,088 --> 00:34:52,410
That's a lot of things but one thing it's definitely not is this post

682
00:34:52,410 --> 00:35:01,534
So unless you have a contractual commitment otherwise your influencers are free to post this content and no she doesn't need a disclosure here

683
00:35:01,534 --> 00:35:09,318
But I think actually the harder question is what do we do with the fact that she was paid three months ago and

684
00:35:09,318 --> 00:35:11,199
Isn't technically working for you now

685
00:35:12,802 --> 00:35:15,945
but she's still talking about your game. Let's say this was

686
00:35:15,945 --> 00:35:21,570
just like her previous tweet, clearly about the game. Do we need a disclosure of that?

687
00:35:21,570 --> 00:35:25,054
I think the answer there is a little surprising.

688
00:35:25,054 --> 00:35:28,157
So, the first answer is,

689
00:35:28,157 --> 00:35:31,540
if you give someone a free copy of your game,

690
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:36,205
according to the FTC, they have to post a disclosure about that game

691
00:35:36,205 --> 00:35:36,725
forever.

692
00:35:38,128 --> 00:35:41,691
means they're still playing your game four years from now in theory

693
00:35:41,691 --> 00:35:45,474
they still need to say hey I just want to let you know

694
00:35:45,474 --> 00:35:49,297
I got a free copy of this game that's really onerous

695
00:35:49,297 --> 00:35:54,661
right in practice I'll be curious to see

696
00:35:54,661 --> 00:35:58,224
if the FCC actually goes after those users that far in the future

697
00:35:58,224 --> 00:36:02,587
but at least in theory that's a practice that could get you in trouble

698
00:36:02,587 --> 00:36:04,268
it's called a moderate risk practice

699
00:36:06,579 --> 00:36:11,004
but what about someone like tina who is paid to run a promotion over two weeks

700
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:11,864
well tina

701
00:36:11,864 --> 00:36:14,207
only has to disclose

702
00:36:14,207 --> 00:36:15,448
for the period of a promotion

703
00:36:15,448 --> 00:36:19,452
and once she's fulfilled her contractual obligation

704
00:36:19,452 --> 00:36:20,994
she no longer has to disclose

705
00:36:20,994 --> 00:36:25,919
this might not seem to make a lot of sense because maybe tina was paid a lot more

706
00:36:25,919 --> 00:36:27,600
money than the person who got the game for free

707
00:36:29,236 --> 00:36:31,598
the way you can get around this

708
00:36:31,598 --> 00:36:35,041
is rather than just send free copies of your game

709
00:36:35,041 --> 00:36:37,623
to a bunch of influencers, to the extent you can,

710
00:36:37,623 --> 00:36:39,525
to the extent you're able to do this,

711
00:36:39,525 --> 00:36:41,306
and I get that in the process of marketing

712
00:36:41,306 --> 00:36:42,908
it can be difficult,

713
00:36:42,908 --> 00:36:45,170
but if you're able to instead enter in a contract with them

714
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:47,672
and say, I'll give you $60,

715
00:36:47,672 --> 00:36:50,935
or whatever the price of your game is,

716
00:36:50,935 --> 00:36:53,657
to do one Twitch stream of my game.

717
00:36:53,657 --> 00:36:56,099
And then once that contract's fulfilled,

718
00:36:56,099 --> 00:36:57,280
they don't have to keep disclosing.

719
00:36:59,611 --> 00:37:01,772
which is going to be a lot easier for them

720
00:37:01,772 --> 00:37:03,914
and a lot easier for you as a game developer

721
00:37:03,914 --> 00:37:05,394
monitoring what your influencers do.

722
00:37:05,394 --> 00:37:11,518
Final thing I wanted to bring up with this tweet

723
00:37:11,518 --> 00:37:17,502
is you might be tempted when you're hiring influencers

724
00:37:17,502 --> 00:37:20,083
to put restraints on what they can do

725
00:37:20,083 --> 00:37:22,165
even once the promotion's done.

726
00:37:23,121 --> 00:37:26,564
right this doesn't seem crazy I totally get it right you have an influencer you

727
00:37:26,564 --> 00:37:27,885
wanna say to him look

728
00:37:27,885 --> 00:37:31,828
if you say a racial slur in the next year I want my money back

729
00:37:31,828 --> 00:37:34,550
because that's not my brand and that's not how I wanna promote my brand

730
00:37:34,550 --> 00:37:38,613
it's worth thinking about when you're drafting your contracts

731
00:37:38,613 --> 00:37:42,536
what sort of restraints you wanna put on the conduct of your influencers for the

732
00:37:42,536 --> 00:37:42,756
future

733
00:37:42,756 --> 00:37:47,060
but I told you that when somebody has a contract

734
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,942
they only have to disclose for the length of that contract

735
00:37:50,805 --> 00:37:54,449
And that means if you're putting restrictions on your influencers

736
00:37:54,449 --> 00:37:57,051
that go far beyond the promotional period,

737
00:37:57,051 --> 00:38:00,154
they have to keep disclosing when they play your game

738
00:38:00,154 --> 00:38:01,675
for that whole period.

739
00:38:01,675 --> 00:38:04,838
So there's a little give and take here, right? You gain more control, but then you also

740
00:38:04,838 --> 00:38:07,420
have more obligations in terms of monitoring.

741
00:38:07,420 --> 00:38:10,403
So something to think about when you're working with influencers and recruiting them.

742
00:38:12,008 --> 00:38:13,348
okay so our takeaways here

743
00:38:13,348 --> 00:38:18,129
are there's no official guidance on how long after an event establishes a material

744
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:19,089
connection but

745
00:38:19,089 --> 00:38:22,370
based on those thousands of pages and all those settlements

746
00:38:22,370 --> 00:38:25,470
the period's likely indefinite

747
00:38:25,470 --> 00:38:29,211
if the influencer receives the game or other product for free with no

748
00:38:29,211 --> 00:38:30,431
corresponding obligation

749
00:38:30,431 --> 00:38:34,452
but on the flip side the period's likely limited to the length of the contractor

750
00:38:34,452 --> 00:38:35,772
obligation

751
00:38:35,772 --> 00:38:38,152
if one is imposed

752
00:38:38,152 --> 00:38:39,833
very low risk for companies

753
00:38:40,608 --> 00:38:43,309
uh... once proposed featuring the game

754
00:38:43,309 --> 00:38:46,370
uh... after the contractual term

755
00:38:46,370 --> 00:38:49,151
somewhat more rest for the influencers

756
00:38:49,151 --> 00:38:52,952
uh... but at the moment we haven't seen any actions enforcement actions like

757
00:38:52,952 --> 00:38:56,033
that and there's absolutely no rest for political speech if you're an influencer

758
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:59,455
in the room and you're making political commentary you can say whatever you want

759
00:38:59,455 --> 00:39:01,075
and you don't have to worry about disclosures

760
00:39:02,343 --> 00:39:04,245
uh... and the final point

761
00:39:04,245 --> 00:39:08,048
restrictions on content in social media beyond the promotional period

762
00:39:08,048 --> 00:39:10,531
may be useful to preserve your brand image

763
00:39:10,531 --> 00:39:13,634
but keep in mind if you impose them then you have to keep monitoring

764
00:39:13,634 --> 00:39:16,516
and your influencer has to keep disclosing for whatever the length of

765
00:39:16,516 --> 00:39:17,197
that contract is

766
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:23,174
so that's my presentation

767
00:39:23,174 --> 00:39:27,963
that's when you need to disclose what they should look like and how to monitor

768
00:39:27,963 --> 00:39:29,546
i've put my contact info up on the board

769
00:39:29,546 --> 00:39:33,334
uh... and for now i'm happy to take any questions you may have

770
00:39:42,826 --> 00:39:46,887
Hello. Just have a quick question. How does this change for free-to-play games?

771
00:39:46,887 --> 00:39:51,749
If there's no direct monetary compensation to, say, a partner program that we're running,

772
00:39:51,749 --> 00:39:53,670
and we give them in-game items as compensation,

773
00:39:53,670 --> 00:39:58,352
is that different than giving them direct money, essentially?

774
00:39:58,352 --> 00:40:03,894
Sure. So, I would need to know more about what the program itself looks like,

775
00:40:03,894 --> 00:40:07,535
but generally, giving someone in-game items to promote your game

776
00:40:07,535 --> 00:40:10,656
triggers all these obligations. Just as if you'd given them cash.

777
00:40:11,497 --> 00:40:16,669
right? I think that's a surprising result, and hopefully I can do my job better and convince

778
00:40:16,669 --> 00:40:20,939
the FTC that that's not the right result, but for now, they're treated just like somebody

779
00:40:20,939 --> 00:40:21,480
who paid cash.

780
00:40:24,075 --> 00:40:26,036
Hi, thanks, great talk.

781
00:40:26,036 --> 00:40:27,257
Just a quick question.

782
00:40:27,257 --> 00:40:29,699
We were talking about the FTC here.

783
00:40:29,699 --> 00:40:33,082
So what about companies which are based outside the US?

784
00:40:33,082 --> 00:40:36,164
And let's say even the influencer is a,

785
00:40:36,164 --> 00:40:39,026
let's say a British guy or girl.

786
00:40:39,026 --> 00:40:41,908
And then, you know, we sell the game on Steam

787
00:40:41,908 --> 00:40:45,031
and clearly Twitter is based in the US.

788
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:46,772
So how does that work?

789
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:48,373
Sure, so that's a great question.

790
00:40:48,373 --> 00:40:51,816
If your game is sold in the United States,

791
00:40:52,519 --> 00:40:57,022
and the influencers you're hiring are creating content that's

792
00:40:57,022 --> 00:40:59,063
most likely going to be viewed in the United States,

793
00:40:59,063 --> 00:40:59,944
then these rules apply.

794
00:40:59,944 --> 00:41:02,946
As a practical matter,

795
00:41:02,946 --> 00:41:06,069
the FTC is less likely to come after you because it'd be a pain for them, right?

796
00:41:06,069 --> 00:41:07,370
They'd have to go abroad.

797
00:41:07,370 --> 00:41:11,353
There's a whole bunch of legal rules they'd have to follow,

798
00:41:11,353 --> 00:41:12,774
so you're probably a little bit safer,

799
00:41:12,774 --> 00:41:14,115
but formally these same rules apply.

800
00:41:14,115 --> 00:41:15,536
Great.

801
00:41:15,536 --> 00:41:18,658
Well, if I don't have any more...

802
00:41:18,658 --> 00:41:19,699
Oh, sorry. Go for it.

803
00:41:23,349 --> 00:41:29,473
So I have an interesting situation that came up recently in the past. One of my influencers

804
00:41:29,473 --> 00:41:35,517
paid cash and bought their own copy of the game, but I gave them copies for them to distribute for

805
00:41:35,517 --> 00:41:42,201
free to their streamers. Even though they weren't streaming the copy that I bought them, are they

806
00:41:42,201 --> 00:41:49,066
forever now have to disclose or did they only have to disclose in which, in the stream in which

807
00:41:49,066 --> 00:41:50,466
they gave away the free copies?

808
00:41:51,977 --> 00:41:57,398
I think it would be very low risk to continue forward without disclosure.

809
00:41:57,398 --> 00:42:02,720
I think that's a great example of how do we work within the rules to not make our influencers

810
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,501
have this weight that's dragging them down forever.

811
00:42:04,501 --> 00:42:07,822
If they bought the game, within the stream where they're giving them out, they have to

812
00:42:07,822 --> 00:42:11,383
disclose they got the copies of those games from the game developer, from you.

813
00:42:11,383 --> 00:42:15,565
But as long as they're disclosing within that stream and aren't giving out free copies in

814
00:42:15,565 --> 00:42:20,787
the future, that's enough, and I'd be very comfortable with that situation.

815
00:42:24,235 --> 00:42:25,496
Hi, thanks, great talk.

816
00:42:25,496 --> 00:42:28,417
I have maybe a tangent, maybe this is a better offline

817
00:42:28,417 --> 00:42:31,558
discussion, but I'm curious about the relationship between

818
00:42:31,558 --> 00:42:36,140
streamers in particular and the platforms themselves.

819
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:39,942
Incentivization of using certain types of features that

820
00:42:39,942 --> 00:42:43,143
are known to keep engagement and the financial relationship

821
00:42:43,143 --> 00:42:46,224
between platforms like Twitch and streamers.

822
00:42:46,224 --> 00:42:48,625
Is there any additional required disclosure from the

823
00:42:48,625 --> 00:42:52,027
platform context about the financial relationship between

824
00:42:52,027 --> 00:42:52,947
people in that platform?

825
00:42:54,127 --> 00:42:56,191
Sure, no, that's an interesting question.

826
00:42:56,191 --> 00:42:59,116
I think the short answer is no.

827
00:42:59,116 --> 00:42:59,397
So.

828
00:43:00,314 --> 00:43:02,295
At least in the near future,

829
00:43:02,295 --> 00:43:05,197
the FTC enforcement is gonna be focused on the influencers

830
00:43:05,197 --> 00:43:07,519
and on the companies that paid them initially.

831
00:43:07,519 --> 00:43:09,900
And platforms can kind of sit on the sidelines.

832
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:12,722
Although in practice, they are developing tools, right?

833
00:43:12,722 --> 00:43:15,684
Like so YouTube now has a tool where some of the products

834
00:43:15,684 --> 00:43:17,605
in your video are sponsored,

835
00:43:17,605 --> 00:43:21,027
it will display a little disclosure about that.

836
00:43:21,027 --> 00:43:23,088
And so you can use those tools.

837
00:43:23,088 --> 00:43:25,029
Sometimes those tools won't necessarily perfectly line up

838
00:43:25,029 --> 00:43:27,131
with what I just talked about here.

839
00:43:27,131 --> 00:43:28,692
But I don't think the platforms themselves

840
00:43:28,692 --> 00:43:29,552
have an obligation.

841
00:43:32,265 --> 00:43:39,271
Hi, you talked about the idea of creating contracts with streamers or influencers and

842
00:43:39,271 --> 00:43:45,077
saying instead of giving you X game for free, let's give you X amount of money that would

843
00:43:45,077 --> 00:43:48,640
then free up some of that long-term obligation for disclosure.

844
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:53,785
Should streamers be thinking about requesting those kinds of contracts when looking at influencing

845
00:43:53,785 --> 00:43:54,766
games?

846
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:56,728
Absolutely, to the extent they're able to.

847
00:43:57,215 --> 00:43:59,998
So I think these, as we saw in the presentation,

848
00:43:59,998 --> 00:44:03,441
the real world examples of both the FTC coming

849
00:44:03,441 --> 00:44:06,504
after the influencer and the company themselves.

850
00:44:06,504 --> 00:44:07,945
I realize in practice it can be hard,

851
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,486
because sometimes someone just sends you a free copy

852
00:44:09,486 --> 00:44:12,008
of the game and it's, you send them an email and say,

853
00:44:12,008 --> 00:44:13,810
hey, could you send me some money instead

854
00:44:13,810 --> 00:44:16,553
and I'll just buy the copy and they never respond.

855
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,494
So I get that it can be difficult in practice,

856
00:44:18,494 --> 00:44:19,875
but the extent you can do that, yeah,

857
00:44:19,875 --> 00:44:21,757
that would be great and definitely reduce your risk.

858
00:44:26,386 --> 00:44:31,648
Nate Blair, Hi-Rez Studios. Two questions, one probably pretty straightforward and easy,

859
00:44:31,648 --> 00:44:38,170
one tiny bit more maybe. Employees that are not paid to do the streaming they are doing,

860
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:42,731
I presume you would advise that they acknowledge the fact they are an employee in the streams

861
00:44:42,731 --> 00:44:49,593
they are doing. Thoughts on that? Second thought, second question being, what about your e-sports

862
00:44:49,593 --> 00:44:51,434
players who

863
00:44:51,870 --> 00:44:56,613
they're playing in your leagues, you're not specifically paying them to stream,

864
00:44:56,613 --> 00:45:00,056
but nevertheless they do have connections back to the league, back to the teams, etc.

865
00:45:00,056 --> 00:45:03,598
Sure. So I think you're right. The first question is easy.

866
00:45:03,598 --> 00:45:07,661
The employees, that's the CEO of the YouTube channel I talked about,

867
00:45:07,661 --> 00:45:12,424
the employees need to disclose if it's not already clear from the content they're creating that they're an employee,

868
00:45:12,424 --> 00:45:13,845
which often it's not.

869
00:45:13,845 --> 00:45:17,007
There are, sometimes it is, but that needs to be made clear in some manner.

870
00:45:17,727 --> 00:45:23,190
To the eSports question, I think that goes, we'll go all the way back to this rule here

871
00:45:23,190 --> 00:45:28,513
that I put up in a bunch of colors. So I think the answer here comes down to the blue.

872
00:45:28,513 --> 00:45:33,736
Do consumers understand that the eSports athletes are being paid to promote the product?

873
00:45:34,828 --> 00:45:40,590
I think the answer is probably yes, at least within the official setting of the game environment.

874
00:45:40,590 --> 00:45:43,631
So when you go to a tournament and you see them playing on certain computers or using

875
00:45:43,631 --> 00:45:48,492
certain headphones, my guess is most consumers understand that that's sponsored, right?

876
00:45:48,492 --> 00:45:53,754
That they're paid to do that, and so there probably doesn't need to be a disclosure there.

877
00:45:53,754 --> 00:45:58,616
But in the short term, maybe, particularly as eSports grows and it becomes more established

878
00:45:58,616 --> 00:46:02,577
and these norms get figured out, maybe it would be good to have a disclosure.

879
00:46:07,002 --> 00:46:13,567
Great talk, thank you. There was discussion with cryptocurrencies and making contracts

880
00:46:13,567 --> 00:46:21,393
in those exchanges. How does the FTC view the contract within a cryptocurrency in the

881
00:46:21,393 --> 00:46:30,199
discussion of creating a disclosure? Because it's not regulated at this point, is there

882
00:46:30,199 --> 00:46:35,343
any more risk when dealing with a contract inside of a cryptocurrency?

883
00:46:37,575 --> 00:46:39,116
Two, I just want to clarify your question.

884
00:46:39,116 --> 00:46:41,556
Are you talking about paying influencers of cryptocurrency,

885
00:46:41,556 --> 00:46:43,217
or are you talking about a contract

886
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:45,457
that is structured within cryptocurrencies

887
00:46:45,457 --> 00:46:47,078
so that the payment's only delivered

888
00:46:47,078 --> 00:46:48,318
once they fulfill some obligation?

889
00:46:48,318 --> 00:46:48,938
The latter.

890
00:46:48,938 --> 00:46:50,179
The latter, okay.

891
00:46:50,179 --> 00:46:51,599
There's no additional risk

892
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:53,599
because you're using cryptocurrency.

893
00:46:53,599 --> 00:46:54,980
Doesn't mean you're free of risk,

894
00:46:54,980 --> 00:46:57,240
but there's no reason that should change

895
00:46:57,240 --> 00:47:00,201
the risk profile for anything you're doing.

896
00:47:00,201 --> 00:47:01,181
Okay, great, thank you.

897
00:47:01,181 --> 00:47:01,441
Hey.

898
00:47:01,441 --> 00:47:01,481
Do.

899
00:47:08,433 --> 00:47:16,115
The disclosure requirements also encapsulate media channels

900
00:47:16,115 --> 00:47:18,216
that aren't personal brands.

901
00:47:18,216 --> 00:47:19,996
So for example, if it's a media channel,

902
00:47:19,996 --> 00:47:22,897
it's just like a passion page or something like that.

903
00:47:22,897 --> 00:47:25,218
Do we have to disclose that we were

904
00:47:25,218 --> 00:47:27,278
paid to do that advertisement if it's not

905
00:47:27,278 --> 00:47:33,100
our personal brand promoting it, just like a news channel?

906
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:38,220
Yes, there's a platform agnostic, so to speak,

907
00:47:38,220 --> 00:47:40,884
that's a big word for we don't care what you're on

908
00:47:40,884 --> 00:47:42,105
and we don't care what you do.

909
00:47:42,105 --> 00:47:45,390
And I think this slide here, right?

910
00:47:45,390 --> 00:47:49,716
Any person, explicit or implicit, product or service, right?

911
00:47:49,716 --> 00:47:50,918
I mean, pretty broad scope.

912
00:47:51,578 --> 00:47:53,159
into which this applies.

913
00:47:53,159 --> 00:47:55,100
So if you're talking about just like a blog,

914
00:47:55,100 --> 00:47:56,600
and maybe it's not your personal blog,

915
00:47:56,600 --> 00:47:59,241
or maybe it's a news website or something, absolutely.

916
00:47:59,241 --> 00:48:01,101
An example where we see that come up

917
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:02,942
is sponsored content on,

918
00:48:02,942 --> 00:48:04,602
think about like Polygon,

919
00:48:04,602 --> 00:48:05,843
it'd be like from our sponsors, right?

920
00:48:05,843 --> 00:48:08,864
They make clear that this is actually an ad

921
00:48:08,864 --> 00:48:11,164
that's like an article, but it was sponsored.

922
00:48:11,164 --> 00:48:13,225
And you have to make clear that, you know,

923
00:48:13,225 --> 00:48:15,906
that article was paid for, that promotion was paid for.

924
00:48:15,906 --> 00:48:16,206
Okay.

925
00:48:16,206 --> 00:48:20,867
So this also is tried and true for,

926
00:48:22,613 --> 00:48:29,080
Bartering tangible goods as well like you say you were to send a female a

927
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:35,427
T-shirt and she posts about your brand does even though you didn't pay her like you said, you know, you gave her something for free

928
00:48:35,427 --> 00:48:37,269
she would have to

929
00:48:37,269 --> 00:48:42,375
Disclose that yes, I'm how partnered with you. Okay. Cool. Thanks

930
00:48:45,316 --> 00:48:47,878
Okay, well thank you guys so much.

931
00:48:47,878 --> 00:48:50,160
If there are no other questions, I'll let you guys go,

932
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:51,501
but I do want to remind you

933
00:48:51,501 --> 00:48:53,282
to please fill out the evaluations.

934
00:48:53,282 --> 00:48:55,263
I know they're sort of a pain for you to fill out,

935
00:48:55,263 --> 00:48:56,544
but they're great for us.

936
00:48:56,544 --> 00:48:58,586
Helps us learn what you guys enjoyed, what you didn't,

937
00:48:58,586 --> 00:49:00,928
and how next year I can be even better.

938
00:49:00,928 --> 00:49:01,768
So, thank you.
