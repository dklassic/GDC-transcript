00:00:14,271 --> 00:00:18,053
Hello, and thank you for coming to my Contract Killers talk on the legal ins and outs of

2
00:00:18,073 --> 00:00:22,315
video game publishing agreements. I'll be looking at some key provisions in publishing

3
00:00:22,355 --> 00:00:27,117
contracts and suggesting how developers can snuff out any red flags that could cause issues

4
00:00:27,197 --> 00:00:28,458
as you develop and launch your game.

5
00:00:32,921 --> 00:00:35,063
Before we get started, I'll just give you a little bit about me.

6
00:00:35,964 --> 00:00:39,486
My name is Tim Ripper-Davies, and I'm a media and entertainment

7
00:00:40,247 --> 00:00:43,170
and games lawyer and partner at Sheridans, based in London, UK.

8
00:00:44,030 --> 00:00:45,792
I work with developers, publishers,

9
00:00:46,032 --> 00:00:48,314
and a host of other games industry professionals

10
00:00:48,914 --> 00:00:51,977
on a wide range of matters, including, unsurprisingly,

11
00:00:52,277 --> 00:00:53,518
video games publishing contracts.

12
00:00:54,479 --> 00:00:55,620
And that's what we're going to look at today

13
00:00:55,660 --> 00:00:56,541
in a little bit more detail.

14
00:00:58,622 --> 00:01:06,903
What I hope to bring to this talk is my insight in acting for lots of indie devs and ethical games publishers in publishing contract negotiations.

15
00:01:08,124 --> 00:01:13,325
If you have any questions after the session, then please feel free to reach out to me on any of the methods I've listed here.

16
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:26,208
If you'll forgive me for doing a quick plug before we get started. I'm also a passionate mental health advocate and I'm very fortunate to work as a trustee at Safe in Our World.

17
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:31,970
a video games mental health charity that advocates for better mental health awareness

18
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:35,674
and support for games industry professionals as well as players.

19
00:01:36,875 --> 00:01:39,678
If you'd like to know more information or if you'd like to make a donation

20
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:45,385
or if you'd like to get involved then please visit safeinourworld.org for more information.

21
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:51,992
So a quick disclaimer before we get started.

22
00:01:52,012 --> 00:01:56,335
So while I am a qualified lawyer, sadly this talk is not legal advice.

23
00:01:57,156 --> 00:02:00,539
It should be treated as legal education and guidance concerning publishing contracts.

24
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:08,605
It is also not a definitive list of things that you can or should change during a negotiation process.

25
00:02:09,406 --> 00:02:12,108
While I'll do my best to run through as much as I can in the time we have.

26
00:02:13,600 --> 00:02:16,741
we still might not have enough time to cover everything that goes into a publishing contract

27
00:02:17,102 --> 00:02:21,643
and all those things that you might want to change or that might be nice to have changes done

28
00:02:22,183 --> 00:02:23,644
when you do that, go through that process.

29
00:02:24,764 --> 00:02:27,345
We could easily stretch this to another two to three sessions.

30
00:02:27,605 --> 00:02:30,806
I suspect that might be a bit boring, so we'll just keep it to this one for now.

31
00:02:32,527 --> 00:02:37,849
However, I have written some articles that you can find on Garma Sutra, also under the Contract Killer's name.

32
00:02:38,389 --> 00:02:41,810
So if you want more information or reading after the session, then please feel free to look those up.

33
00:02:43,934 --> 00:02:52,698
I'm also trying to keep this talk a little bit more commercial, so we're not going to look at necessarily the boilerplate things or represent warranties that might come into a contract.

34
00:02:53,799 --> 00:03:08,785
But if I can give a shout out to my fellow legal professional Chris Reid, who has given numerous talks at GDC in years past, I would highly recommend checking out his Practical Law 101, 201 and 301 series that you can find in the vault and on YouTube.

35
00:03:09,026 --> 00:03:09,826
Well worth checking out.

36
00:03:13,510 --> 00:03:18,992
So my goal of this talk, I want to give developers confidence heading into a negotiation with the publisher

37
00:03:19,372 --> 00:03:22,653
that it is okay to ask for certain things in your contract to be changed.

38
00:03:25,814 --> 00:03:30,956
My main reason for doing this, well, publishing contracts are inherently drafted in the publisher's favour.

39
00:03:31,696 --> 00:03:34,977
After all, they would have probably engaged a lawyer to draft it for them,

40
00:03:35,457 --> 00:03:39,278
or it might have been someone internally, either the producer, business development person.

41
00:03:40,655 --> 00:03:42,116
that would have drafted it for the publisher.

42
00:03:42,277 --> 00:03:44,378
So they've been drafting it from the perspective

43
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:45,639
of protecting their business.

44
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:50,263
So by default, the contract that any publisher gives you

45
00:03:50,463 --> 00:03:51,504
is going to be against you.

46
00:03:52,144 --> 00:03:54,326
And that might even include situations

47
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:56,347
where you as the developer haven't done anything wrong

48
00:03:57,248 --> 00:03:57,968
and you're not at fault.

49
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:00,450
So this is what I want to rectify.

50
00:04:01,591 --> 00:04:03,633
Now it's unlikely that you can expect a publisher

51
00:04:03,693 --> 00:04:05,874
to sign your game on completely different terms

52
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:06,975
from the contract they've given you.

53
00:04:08,438 --> 00:04:12,380
and the end result of any negotiations are likely to be a symmetrical contract

54
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:15,641
whereby both developer and publisher have equal rights and obligations.

55
00:04:16,502 --> 00:04:18,003
The publisher is always going to win on that one.

56
00:04:18,963 --> 00:04:21,424
But the end result of any negotiation should be a compromise

57
00:04:21,724 --> 00:04:23,625
and it should be a compromise that both sides are happy with.

58
00:04:25,126 --> 00:04:27,847
So to meet the same, we'll be looking at some reasonable and fair changes

59
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:30,109
that developers could think about making.

60
00:04:30,669 --> 00:04:32,630
And if there's any publishers listening, and I hope there are,

61
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:35,611
then these could be fair and reasonable changes

62
00:04:35,651 --> 00:04:37,252
that you might reasonably consider accepting.

63
00:04:43,791 --> 00:04:45,931
So what factors can affect your publishing terms

64
00:04:46,411 --> 00:04:47,572
or your negotiating position?

65
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:51,092
Now there's probably more than you think,

66
00:04:51,612 --> 00:04:53,573
but the most obvious is probably the publisher themselves.

67
00:04:54,533 --> 00:04:56,473
And that comes down to actually some publishers

68
00:04:56,513 --> 00:04:58,114
won't even negotiate their terms at all,

69
00:04:59,114 --> 00:05:01,534
whether they're too stubborn, lazy, or other reasons.

70
00:05:02,395 --> 00:05:03,195
And they're the kind of partners

71
00:05:03,215 --> 00:05:04,555
that you might want to think about

72
00:05:04,595 --> 00:05:07,235
whether it's actually a good business decision for you

73
00:05:07,576 --> 00:05:09,356
or your studio or your game going forward.

74
00:05:11,257 --> 00:05:13,198
Other factors might include the budget you're asking for.

75
00:05:13,838 --> 00:05:16,059
Generally higher budgets will come from larger publishers.

76
00:05:16,559 --> 00:05:19,080
Larger publishers tend to be a little bit more unwavering

77
00:05:19,540 --> 00:05:20,801
in their ability to negotiate

78
00:05:20,881 --> 00:05:22,661
or will to negotiate their publishing terms.

79
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,862
If this is your first game,

80
00:05:26,543 --> 00:05:28,303
then you can definitely expect to be low board

81
00:05:28,343 --> 00:05:29,744
in terms of the commercial legals.

82
00:05:30,484 --> 00:05:32,305
And they'll generally be seen,

83
00:05:32,445 --> 00:05:34,485
you'll generally be seen as a higher risk prospect

84
00:05:34,846 --> 00:05:37,487
or signing to a publisher's existing portfolio.

85
00:05:39,391 --> 00:05:41,473
However, projects that are in the latest stage of development

86
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:43,154
will tend to be seen as lower risk,

87
00:05:43,755 --> 00:05:45,936
as generally the publisher's upfront costs will be lower.

88
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:49,139
That usually allows you to be able to negotiate

89
00:05:49,179 --> 00:05:50,740
better commercial and legal terms.

90
00:05:54,884 --> 00:05:56,445
So, what are the contract killers

91
00:05:56,465 --> 00:05:57,746
that I'm referring to in this talk?

92
00:05:59,287 --> 00:06:01,509
To me, these are terms in most publishing contracts

93
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:04,592
that will invariably affect the developer

94
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:05,472
in a negative way,

95
00:06:06,153 --> 00:06:07,574
especially in the event of a falling out

96
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:08,515
between the parties.

97
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:11,112
and even if the developer is not at fault.

98
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:14,095
So some of the red flags we're going to look at include

99
00:06:14,595 --> 00:06:15,936
what's happening with your game IP

100
00:06:16,617 --> 00:06:18,459
and to do this we'll dive into

101
00:06:18,519 --> 00:06:20,841
what the difference between an intellectual property assignment

102
00:06:21,461 --> 00:06:22,823
and an intellectual property license.

103
00:06:24,164 --> 00:06:26,826
We'll then look at publishing licenses in a bit more detail

104
00:06:26,926 --> 00:06:28,648
and some of the bad license terms to look out for.

105
00:06:30,009 --> 00:06:32,051
And then we'll look at how you can get paid

106
00:06:32,872 --> 00:06:34,273
and some of the terms around that

107
00:06:34,373 --> 00:06:36,235
and some bad payment terms to look out for.

108
00:06:38,693 --> 00:06:42,115
So, Contract Killer 1, what is happening to your game IP?

109
00:06:43,376 --> 00:06:45,637
In particular, are you giving this away unwittingly?

110
00:06:47,318 --> 00:06:49,560
Publishing contracts will vary from publisher to publisher.

111
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:53,743
However, most of these contracts will have at least one thing

112
00:06:53,783 --> 00:06:56,905
in common, and that is a clause giving the publisher the rights

113
00:06:56,925 --> 00:06:59,286
to publish, market, distribute, and otherwise

114
00:06:59,366 --> 00:07:02,728
export your game across various platforms and territories.

115
00:07:06,567 --> 00:07:08,589
Now a publisher needs this permission from a developer

116
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:10,310
before they can actually publish your game.

117
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:12,693
Yeah, obviously, I think that's probably

118
00:07:12,753 --> 00:07:13,473
quite an obvious statement.

119
00:07:13,753 --> 00:07:15,475
But this is because games are a bundle

120
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,636
of intellectual property rights

121
00:07:17,477 --> 00:07:20,059
that you as the creator of the game, the developer will own.

122
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:23,342
So obviously the publisher needs permission from you first

123
00:07:23,402 --> 00:07:24,703
before they can just go and publish it.

124
00:07:26,104 --> 00:07:27,606
Similar thing would happen

125
00:07:27,666 --> 00:07:29,287
if you wanted to use Mario in your game.

126
00:07:29,507 --> 00:07:31,309
You'd need to get permission from Nintendo to do that.

127
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:33,671
Although that's quite unlikely, I'd say.

128
00:07:35,305 --> 00:07:43,770
This permission is normally detailed under the Grants of Rights section, but it might also be called the Operative Provision, Ownership, Publishing Licence or something like that.

129
00:07:45,251 --> 00:07:50,513
In each case, this Grants of Rights section will give the publisher the right to use the intellectual property rights in your game.

130
00:07:51,554 --> 00:07:54,215
The publishing contract might deal with this in a couple of ways.

131
00:07:55,623 --> 00:07:57,164
The first being an exclusive license.

132
00:07:57,704 --> 00:07:58,724
That's the most common way.

133
00:07:59,245 --> 00:08:00,365
And this will give the publisher the right

134
00:08:00,385 --> 00:08:02,286
to be the only person allowed to publish your game

135
00:08:03,026 --> 00:08:04,147
across various platforms

136
00:08:04,207 --> 00:08:05,608
in various countries around the world.

137
00:08:06,348 --> 00:08:08,169
And that would even stop you as the developer

138
00:08:08,189 --> 00:08:11,050
from self-publishing or from engaging any other party

139
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:12,231
from doing any of those things.

140
00:08:13,531 --> 00:08:15,052
We'll refer to this exclusive license

141
00:08:15,372 --> 00:08:16,733
as the publishing license from here on out.

142
00:08:18,978 --> 00:08:21,218
The other option is an intellectual property assignment.

143
00:08:21,719 --> 00:08:24,479
And that's effectively where the publisher buys the IP

144
00:08:24,619 --> 00:08:25,680
or percentage of it off you.

145
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:30,201
It's arguable that the exclusive license approach is better,

146
00:08:31,101 --> 00:08:33,762
normally because publishing licenses are only temporary,

147
00:08:33,782 --> 00:08:34,962
so they might last for a few years

148
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,483
before the rights revert back to you.

149
00:08:37,923 --> 00:08:40,564
But the worst case scenario

150
00:08:40,584 --> 00:08:42,564
for both the publishing license and an assignment

151
00:08:43,025 --> 00:08:44,625
is that you as the developer can't get the rights

152
00:08:44,685 --> 00:08:45,285
and you're getting back.

153
00:08:47,345 --> 00:08:49,186
that could obviously be a bit of a disaster,

154
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:51,827
especially if you're planning on doing future games

155
00:08:52,247 --> 00:08:54,288
or have future plans for the game

156
00:08:54,328 --> 00:08:55,368
and the franchise you're making.

157
00:09:01,091 --> 00:09:02,912
So let's look at assignments in more detail.

158
00:09:03,952 --> 00:09:05,753
So how does an assignment work in the context

159
00:09:05,793 --> 00:09:07,074
of assigning rights in a video game?

160
00:09:08,954 --> 00:09:10,275
When people talk about assignments,

161
00:09:11,015 --> 00:09:12,796
they're really talking about transfer of ownership.

162
00:09:13,396 --> 00:09:14,677
So think of it like selling a car.

163
00:09:15,759 --> 00:09:19,162
Person A, the current owner of the car, sells the car to Person B for money.

164
00:09:19,803 --> 00:09:21,745
Naturally, Person B is now the new owner of the car.

165
00:09:22,145 --> 00:09:23,646
Person A can't then use it again.

166
00:09:24,507 --> 00:09:26,709
But they have been compensated by receiving money in return.

167
00:09:28,753 --> 00:09:33,857
For video games, the transfer and assignment we're talking about is that of all the intellectual property,

168
00:09:33,877 --> 00:09:39,501
I'm just going to refer to that as IP, that goes into the game, and any other materials relevant to the game itself.

169
00:09:40,242 --> 00:09:45,026
So the IP rights in a game being pretty much everything you can think about on the front end and back end.

170
00:09:45,546 --> 00:09:54,273
It might be the things that you can see, so the art, the animation or hear the music, but it might also be the things that you can't see, such as the code and anything in the back end.

171
00:09:55,854 --> 00:09:57,315
So in the context of a grant of rights,

172
00:09:57,975 --> 00:09:59,535
an assignment of IP in this instance,

173
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:02,736
that being the IP that exists in the video game,

174
00:10:03,556 --> 00:10:05,017
is where the ownership of that game IP

175
00:10:05,357 --> 00:10:07,478
is legally transferred from the developer to the publisher.

176
00:10:09,218 --> 00:10:11,299
The publisher then has the rights in the game IP

177
00:10:11,339 --> 00:10:13,860
and can publish it, distribute it, create new versions,

178
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,120
basically do anything it wants after that point.

179
00:10:18,078 --> 00:10:19,699
So how does this work in practice?

180
00:10:20,439 --> 00:10:22,140
Well, for a finished game, it's fairly straightforward.

181
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:24,541
Developer assigns its IP rights in the game

182
00:10:24,561 --> 00:10:25,201
to the publisher.

183
00:10:25,921 --> 00:10:27,922
Publisher then takes those rights and publishes the game.

184
00:10:29,022 --> 00:10:30,723
The rights will be legally owned by the publisher.

185
00:10:30,943 --> 00:10:33,604
So yes, the developer will no longer own the IP,

186
00:10:34,584 --> 00:10:36,525
but it might still be paid a percentage

187
00:10:36,725 --> 00:10:38,125
from the sales of the game,

188
00:10:38,545 --> 00:10:40,666
or they might have received money up front as compensation.

189
00:10:42,544 --> 00:10:43,725
For a game that's still in development,

190
00:10:43,945 --> 00:10:45,546
it works pretty much a similar way,

191
00:10:46,187 --> 00:10:48,849
except that the developer will be deemed to have assigned IP

192
00:10:49,249 --> 00:10:51,891
as it delivers certain milestones or builds to the developer

193
00:10:52,472 --> 00:10:54,373
until effectively it's delivered a finished game,

194
00:10:54,573 --> 00:10:56,375
in which case all of the rights will then be deemed

195
00:10:56,395 --> 00:10:57,996
to be assigned over to the publisher.

196
00:11:00,018 --> 00:11:01,019
So same thing applies,

197
00:11:01,099 --> 00:11:02,280
publisher ends up with a finished game,

198
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:03,861
it has all the rights into that game

199
00:11:03,921 --> 00:11:06,183
and then can do what it wants, including publishing it.

200
00:11:09,225 --> 00:11:10,146
An assignment of rights

201
00:11:11,238 --> 00:11:12,398
especially intellectual property rights

202
00:11:12,418 --> 00:11:13,659
that we discussed in this way,

203
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,800
is far more common for worker for hire

204
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:16,941
or contracted development.

205
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:19,002
So if you're working on your own IP

206
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:21,103
and talking about a publisher in that sense,

207
00:11:21,443 --> 00:11:23,425
then you probably don't want to assign these rights away.

208
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,846
And you don't have to assign all of your IP rights.

209
00:11:27,627 --> 00:11:30,148
Some publishing contracts may only require a developer

210
00:11:30,168 --> 00:11:32,330
to assign part of its IP to the publisher.

211
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:35,992
This is common in co-funded or co-development of agents

212
00:11:36,032 --> 00:11:37,252
between a developer and a publisher

213
00:11:37,773 --> 00:11:40,434
where both parties are putting in equal amounts of money.

214
00:11:42,538 --> 00:11:44,598
But co-ownership of IP can be messy.

215
00:11:45,339 --> 00:11:46,439
It's not like real property,

216
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,860
so like houses, flats, buildings, and the like,

217
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:51,300
where lines can easily be drawn about who owns what

218
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:52,460
or who has access to what.

219
00:11:53,401 --> 00:11:55,681
Even giving away the smallest percentage of your IP

220
00:11:55,781 --> 00:11:57,482
can cause problems down the line,

221
00:11:58,102 --> 00:11:59,342
especially if you don't have the permission

222
00:11:59,382 --> 00:12:00,643
from the other party to use it.

223
00:12:02,743 --> 00:12:04,164
This will definitely cause a lot of issues

224
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,264
or can cause a lot of issues in the event of a dispute,

225
00:12:06,364 --> 00:12:07,665
especially if you're the developer

226
00:12:07,945 --> 00:12:09,285
and you're naturally at a disadvantage

227
00:12:09,305 --> 00:12:10,525
when it comes to bargaining position.

228
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,882
And as we've spoken about at the start,

229
00:12:16,522 --> 00:12:18,263
if the contract has been drafted by the publisher,

230
00:12:18,643 --> 00:12:20,705
you can bet that in the event of the dispute,

231
00:12:20,785 --> 00:12:22,005
the publisher is going to come out on top.

232
00:12:26,168 --> 00:12:27,668
So what does an assignment clause look like?

233
00:12:28,909 --> 00:12:29,970
In fact, something like this.

234
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:34,472
In this case, the developer owns 50% of its game IP

235
00:12:34,973 --> 00:12:37,034
and assigns the other 50% to the publisher.

236
00:12:37,574 --> 00:12:40,516
Thereafter, the game IP is held 50-50 between the parties.

237
00:12:41,289 --> 00:12:44,190
So if we use the analogy of two people sharing a house,

238
00:12:44,790 --> 00:12:45,891
one person gets the upstairs,

239
00:12:46,211 --> 00:12:47,511
and the other person gets the downstairs.

240
00:12:49,812 --> 00:12:51,272
So how does this work in practice?

241
00:12:51,352 --> 00:12:54,413
Because if the publisher doesn't have all of the game IP,

242
00:12:55,714 --> 00:12:57,914
also they'll likely need an exclusive license

243
00:12:57,934 --> 00:12:59,975
to actually use the developer share of the IP anyway.

244
00:13:00,615 --> 00:13:03,756
So we get to a situation where in order to make this work,

245
00:13:04,317 --> 00:13:06,877
the publisher also needs an exclusive license

246
00:13:06,917 --> 00:13:08,198
in order to use the developer share.

247
00:13:09,947 --> 00:13:11,528
So some common arguments or reasons

248
00:13:12,008 --> 00:13:13,888
suggested by publishers as to why they need

249
00:13:13,908 --> 00:13:15,448
an assignment of your IP.

250
00:13:15,909 --> 00:13:17,809
It might be 50%, it might be more, it might be less.

251
00:13:19,049 --> 00:13:20,170
But the common arguments are,

252
00:13:20,950 --> 00:13:22,850
we need this to protect our investment in you.

253
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,551
This gives us something tangible

254
00:13:25,571 --> 00:13:26,751
that we can show our investors.

255
00:13:28,051 --> 00:13:31,072
Or one more frighteningly that I heard fairly recently was,

256
00:13:31,592 --> 00:13:33,293
we need this in case you go insolvent.

257
00:13:35,193 --> 00:13:37,814
So when might an IP assignment

258
00:13:37,874 --> 00:13:39,194
or partial assignment be justified?

259
00:13:40,622 --> 00:13:43,544
And there's nothing wrong with assigning your rights away in theory,

260
00:13:44,264 --> 00:13:48,888
but if the plan is for the game IP to revert to you at the end of a set period of time,

261
00:13:49,989 --> 00:13:52,951
or when the publisher is in breach, then you need to make sure that that is in the contract.

262
00:13:53,892 --> 00:13:57,154
Otherwise, you might have given your rights to the publisher and you can't get them back.

263
00:14:01,718 --> 00:14:06,561
Whereas the previous example was pretty clear that the developer and publisher would carry the IP 50-50,

264
00:14:07,282 --> 00:14:09,303
you need to be aware of sneaky assignments like this one.

265
00:14:10,558 --> 00:14:12,219
On the face of it, it seems fairly innocuous.

266
00:14:12,239 --> 00:14:15,781
I mean, after all, what's 1% of your game?

267
00:14:16,241 --> 00:14:17,882
What's 1% of the game IP?

268
00:14:18,862 --> 00:14:21,444
However, co-ownership of IP rules

269
00:14:21,824 --> 00:14:23,045
actually give this a lot of power

270
00:14:23,085 --> 00:14:25,126
to the publisher in this case.

271
00:14:25,426 --> 00:14:27,927
So if you're giving any share of your IP away,

272
00:14:28,307 --> 00:14:30,108
you need to make sure that at the end of a contract,

273
00:14:30,389 --> 00:14:31,289
you get the rights back.

274
00:14:31,749 --> 00:14:33,590
And that goes doubly in the event

275
00:14:33,610 --> 00:14:34,811
that the publisher is in breach.

276
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:36,372
There's no way they should be holding on

277
00:14:36,512 --> 00:14:38,013
to your game IP in that case.

278
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:48,358
So some quick fixes. If you receive a publishing contract with an IP assignment, ask yourself

279
00:14:48,398 --> 00:14:54,304
the following questions. Am I comfortable with giving away the rights to my game to

280
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:59,690
my publisher? The answer might be yes. If this is your first game and this deal gives

281
00:14:59,710 --> 00:15:04,434
you sufficient funds to live, pay rent, eat food, all that good stuff, then it might be

282
00:15:04,454 --> 00:15:05,095
the right thing to do.

283
00:15:06,526 --> 00:15:10,007
If the answer's no, then does the contract provide

284
00:15:10,027 --> 00:15:11,308
for the game IP to come back to you

285
00:15:11,348 --> 00:15:12,428
after a certain period of time

286
00:15:13,029 --> 00:15:14,289
or where the publisher is in breach?

287
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,811
If not, then that either needs to be fixed

288
00:15:18,971 --> 00:15:20,892
or you need to make sure that you're fairly compensated

289
00:15:21,132 --> 00:15:22,853
for the fact that you're effectively going to be selling

290
00:15:22,873 --> 00:15:26,614
your IP to the publisher.

291
00:15:26,714 --> 00:15:28,295
Understand the reasons why a publisher

292
00:15:28,315 --> 00:15:30,996
would want to take ownership or part ownership of your IP

293
00:15:31,476 --> 00:15:32,957
and ask why they can't get the same result

294
00:15:32,977 --> 00:15:34,277
from having an exclusive license.

295
00:15:36,476 --> 00:15:41,478
You also need to make sure there's a carve out for your proprietary tools, tech, and code libraries.

296
00:15:42,778 --> 00:15:45,900
These might be things that you want to use from project to project,

297
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:48,220
or you might have already used in previous games that you've made.

298
00:15:49,061 --> 00:15:51,842
An assignment of IP can be pretty much a blunt instrument.

299
00:15:51,862 --> 00:15:54,863
So if you're assigning all the intellectual property rights in a game,

300
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:58,745
that will also include things that you necessarily might want to use again.

301
00:15:59,245 --> 00:16:03,826
So you need to carve those out and provide the publisher with a non-exclusive license to use those.

302
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:08,432
That will allow you to use those again for your future projects.

303
00:16:13,677 --> 00:16:16,340
Exclusive licenses are far more common than IP assignments

304
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,241
in terms of how a publisher gets the permission

305
00:16:18,522 --> 00:16:19,563
from you to publish your game.

306
00:16:21,104 --> 00:16:23,887
This license will normally give the publisher sole permission

307
00:16:23,927 --> 00:16:26,029
to publish, distribute, and otherwise exploit

308
00:16:26,069 --> 00:16:28,872
the game across various platforms and countries

309
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:29,853
for a set period of time.

310
00:16:31,765 --> 00:16:36,308
In granting this permission, you're also going to exclude yourself as the developer from being able to sell the game during this time.

311
00:16:38,289 --> 00:16:47,755
However, if it's done wrong, an exclusive license can also be equivalent to an IP assignment or an IP transfer, and you can easily lock up your rights with the publisher if you're not careful.

312
00:16:49,116 --> 00:16:52,479
So an example of a publishing license looks like this.

313
00:16:58,543 --> 00:16:59,583
As you can see in this slide here.

314
00:17:01,718 --> 00:17:03,580
sorry, previous slide, as you can see here,

315
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,321
you can see it gives exclusive right

316
00:17:05,401 --> 00:17:06,902
during the term and throughout the territory

317
00:17:07,283 --> 00:17:08,784
to be able to publish and otherwise export the game

318
00:17:08,804 --> 00:17:09,425
on the platforms.

319
00:17:14,729 --> 00:17:16,090
So as you can see from that example,

320
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:18,372
a publishing license is normally limited

321
00:17:18,392 --> 00:17:19,533
in the following ways.

322
00:17:20,634 --> 00:17:22,416
Term, that being the length of time

323
00:17:22,456 --> 00:17:24,598
during which the publisher can promote and sell the game,

324
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,821
this would normally be somewhere between five and 10 years.

325
00:17:29,124 --> 00:17:33,646
The territories, that being the countries around the world where the publisher can promote and sell your game.

326
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:42,691
And the platforms, the formats or distribution channels where the publisher can sell your game, such as Steam, Nintendo Switch, Playstation, Xbox, that kind of stuff.

327
00:17:43,852 --> 00:17:50,756
So this brings us to our second contract killer, Bad License Terms, where we're going to look at these publishing licenses in a bit more detail.

328
00:17:54,753 --> 00:17:58,055
So we'll start off by looking at the first two areas that will be caught by a publishing licence

329
00:17:58,635 --> 00:18:01,157
They're the term of the agreement and the territories caught by it

330
00:18:07,661 --> 00:18:11,004
So here's an example of a pretty standard definition of a publishing licence term

331
00:18:11,444 --> 00:18:13,385
describing how long the publishing licence will last for

332
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:18,769
So as you can see it says five years and that's nice within the standard range we're most likely to see

333
00:18:19,789 --> 00:18:22,171
But be aware of the second part that's highlighted in red here

334
00:18:23,677 --> 00:18:26,338
it's actually five years from the last version of the game that's released.

335
00:18:27,099 --> 00:18:32,863
So if the definition of game includes any DLC, add-ons, or maybe even ports

336
00:18:32,923 --> 00:18:36,986
or different versions of the game, then the five years will be reset every

337
00:18:37,006 --> 00:18:38,467
time a new version is released.

338
00:18:38,907 --> 00:18:40,488
So you need to be aware of that.

339
00:18:41,129 --> 00:18:43,430
So check the publishing term quite carefully.

340
00:18:47,793 --> 00:18:50,856
As we mentioned earlier, the exclusive part of a license is the permission

341
00:18:50,896 --> 00:18:52,517
given to the publisher to do certain things.

342
00:18:53,666 --> 00:18:56,628
to the exclusion of anyone else, and that includes you as the developer.

343
00:18:58,028 --> 00:19:00,890
So normally these publishing licenses are granted for a set period of time,

344
00:19:02,111 --> 00:19:06,273
that being a fair amount of time for the publisher to have a fair crack at publishing your game,

345
00:19:06,873 --> 00:19:10,015
normally between 5 and 10 years, but they vary from publisher to publisher.

346
00:19:11,596 --> 00:19:17,659
So you need to be aware of long license periods. For example, if a publisher's license is lasting

347
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,380
for 25 years, like in the bottom example here.

348
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:26,483
Or you need to be careful where a publisher takes the rights to your game in perpetuity.

349
00:19:27,144 --> 00:19:28,085
Like the top example.

350
00:19:28,926 --> 00:19:31,428
That's obviously perpetuity meaning forever.

351
00:19:32,449 --> 00:19:36,874
In that case, you need to be prepared not to get your rights to your game back.

352
00:19:37,635 --> 00:19:40,238
And that's even where the publisher's not doing a good job.

353
00:19:41,119 --> 00:19:42,260
So, how do you fix it?

354
00:19:43,158 --> 00:19:47,001
Well, simple answer, ask for a shorter license period.

355
00:19:47,742 --> 00:19:51,025
The publisher needs a reasonable amount of time to publish the game and that's it.

356
00:19:51,345 --> 00:19:57,430
If they need anything longer, then ask why and try and get an understanding of how they plan to use your rights going forward.

357
00:19:58,191 --> 00:20:02,635
You don't really want their rights just sitting on the shelf or them not distributing your game after 10 years time.

358
00:20:03,135 --> 00:20:06,518
After that time, you probably want those rights back so you can do something with them yourself.

359
00:20:11,390 --> 00:20:15,271
And even shorter licences might be able to run on beyond the initial agreed term.

360
00:20:16,212 --> 00:20:18,272
And that might happen through an auto renewal mechanism.

361
00:20:19,653 --> 00:20:21,894
This might work through inaction by either side.

362
00:20:22,054 --> 00:20:25,875
So for example, the licence term we saw on the previous page of five years, it

363
00:20:25,895 --> 00:20:31,237
might just renew for an additional period of one year, and that might be if no one

364
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:35,519
has given notice to terminate before the end of that five years, the contract will

365
00:20:35,539 --> 00:20:38,700
just renew either for another year, might be two years, might be another five years.

366
00:20:39,973 --> 00:20:42,955
So it's sort of like your PS Plus or your Amazon subscription.

367
00:20:43,516 --> 00:20:47,379
If you don't terminate in time before it renews again, effectively,

368
00:20:47,660 --> 00:20:50,602
you have to pay again and you're locked in for another year.

369
00:20:51,703 --> 00:20:55,066
So how to fix this, you need to know how long the license term runs for

370
00:20:56,027 --> 00:20:58,469
and how much notice you need to give before the end of the initial term

371
00:20:58,930 --> 00:21:01,172
in order to get out of it, if that's what you want to do.

372
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:07,317
Another example of an auto-renewal might be like the example here.

373
00:21:08,532 --> 00:21:12,494
Here the contract extends for one year terms, where the game is still generating revenues

374
00:21:12,534 --> 00:21:13,574
above a certain threshold.

375
00:21:14,295 --> 00:21:18,377
And that enables the publisher to continue benefiting from selling the game, even though

376
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:19,457
the initial term has ended.

377
00:21:20,238 --> 00:21:25,821
And it's how you'd expect those smash hit games to still be, or how a publisher can

378
00:21:25,841 --> 00:21:30,243
make sure that an evergreen game or game that's an absolute smash hit, how they can ensure

379
00:21:30,283 --> 00:21:33,445
that they can keep publishing it, even long after the initial term might have ended.

380
00:21:35,059 --> 00:21:45,126
In theory, this might be a nice compromise, since the game itself that you've created and the publisher's marketing actions should have helped generate revenues long after the game has been released.

381
00:21:46,767 --> 00:21:56,394
However, you need to be aware of setting the threshold too low. Like the example shown here, €10,000 might be too low a bar to set when taking into account the publisher's cut.

382
00:21:57,494 --> 00:22:03,158
In this case, it might be better for the developer to self-publish their own game at this point, so you might want to ask for the rights back.

383
00:22:10,139 --> 00:22:12,240
Let's look at how far a publishing license can reach.

384
00:22:13,961 --> 00:22:15,621
Most publishers will ask for worldwide rights

385
00:22:15,661 --> 00:22:16,381
to publish your game.

386
00:22:16,902 --> 00:22:19,063
That's so they can sell it in as many countries as possible.

387
00:22:20,263 --> 00:22:22,304
So you normally need to check the definition of territory

388
00:22:22,704 --> 00:22:24,385
in the agreement to see exactly what this is

389
00:22:24,405 --> 00:22:25,485
and exactly what they're taking.

390
00:22:27,246 --> 00:22:29,126
And this is a genuine example of a publishing country

391
00:22:29,146 --> 00:22:31,607
that I've seen recently, how they define territory.

392
00:22:32,828 --> 00:22:34,508
And I just quite like the ambition that they show here,

393
00:22:34,548 --> 00:22:35,489
that they might need the rights

394
00:22:35,949 --> 00:22:37,490
to cover parts of space in the future.

395
00:22:40,045 --> 00:22:44,448
And there's nothing wrong with a publisher wanting to publish the game in as many countries or planets as possible.

396
00:22:46,350 --> 00:22:50,453
As a developer, you want the game to get in the hands of as many players as possible around the globe.

397
00:22:51,374 --> 00:22:56,278
However, you should ask the publisher how they plan, what is in their marketing plan,

398
00:22:56,778 --> 00:23:00,581
and to confirm where they plan on selling the game and how they're going to do it.

399
00:23:01,782 --> 00:23:06,006
It is unlikely that the publisher has a presence in every territory around the globe.

400
00:23:06,486 --> 00:23:09,348
So they're going to be using third parties in different territories to help them do it.

401
00:23:10,636 --> 00:23:14,079
So you should know how they plan to do this and who they plan to use.

402
00:23:15,220 --> 00:23:18,243
If possible, ask for case studies based on the developers in their portfolio.

403
00:23:20,305 --> 00:23:22,707
If they don't have plans to publish your game in any of the territories,

404
00:23:22,727 --> 00:23:26,451
for example, China, then you don't necessarily need to give those rights away.

405
00:23:26,471 --> 00:23:29,473
It's better you find another partner for those rights.

406
00:23:30,234 --> 00:23:32,536
That might be a different publisher or might be doing it yourself,

407
00:23:32,556 --> 00:23:36,180
rather than have those rights waste away on the publisher's shelf.

408
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,381
So contract killer number three.

409
00:23:50,822 --> 00:23:52,244
Still looking at bad license terms,

410
00:23:52,404 --> 00:23:54,526
but this time we'll look at the platforms and porting.

411
00:23:56,128 --> 00:23:57,369
So as we've seen with term and territory,

412
00:23:57,389 --> 00:23:58,610
the publisher is going to want to take rights

413
00:23:58,650 --> 00:24:00,051
on as many platforms as possible.

414
00:24:00,932 --> 00:24:02,554
They'll want the license to be as long as possible

415
00:24:03,775 --> 00:24:05,477
and to cover as many countries as possible too.

416
00:24:10,862 --> 00:24:12,043
As you can see from this example.

417
00:24:13,712 --> 00:24:16,373
the publisher is asking for rights to pretty much all platforms.

418
00:24:17,113 --> 00:24:20,215
And that also includes a catch-all so that they can put the game out on any

419
00:24:20,275 --> 00:24:22,636
next generation platforms that arise in the next 10 years.

420
00:24:23,776 --> 00:24:25,317
So yeah, it's pretty broad.

421
00:24:28,438 --> 00:24:31,660
The rationale that publishers will give for this is that they want to control

422
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,842
the marketing across all territories and platforms and thereby control the quality.

423
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:52,780
However, if the publisher is taking rights for all platforms,

424
00:24:54,041 --> 00:24:57,243
you should check whether you have to deliver a version of the game for all of the platforms too.

425
00:24:59,024 --> 00:25:01,145
So first off, check what are you being paid to develop.

426
00:25:02,405 --> 00:25:04,346
If you're only developing the Steam version of the game,

427
00:25:05,106 --> 00:25:07,628
and that's the only version you're going to deliver to the publisher,

428
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,709
then you need to include that in the contract.

429
00:25:10,429 --> 00:25:12,890
Otherwise, you might be on the hook to develop console versions as well.

430
00:25:15,345 --> 00:25:18,226
A key thing to check might be including PC versions.

431
00:25:18,707 --> 00:25:20,767
PC might also include Windows,

432
00:25:20,927 --> 00:25:24,049
but it might also include Linux and macOS.

433
00:25:24,709 --> 00:25:26,830
If you don't have the ability to develop for Linux and macOS,

434
00:25:26,850 --> 00:25:27,910
then you might want to exclude that.

435
00:25:28,270 --> 00:25:29,951
And you might want to specify that PC means

436
00:25:30,151 --> 00:25:31,111
Windows PC only.

437
00:25:34,232 --> 00:25:35,753
If the contract is clear as to what platforms

438
00:25:35,773 --> 00:25:36,373
you're delivering,

439
00:25:37,174 --> 00:25:38,654
then you should ask who's going to be developing

440
00:25:38,694 --> 00:25:39,775
the other platform versions.

441
00:25:40,949 --> 00:25:45,550
If they don't have plans to develop these right now, then ask why they need the rights right now.

442
00:25:46,951 --> 00:25:51,072
If the publisher is only providing refunding for the Steam or PC version, as we mentioned,

443
00:25:51,512 --> 00:25:57,253
then you shouldn't necessarily have to lock up the rights for console, mobile, or other non-funded platforms with that publisher,

444
00:25:58,273 --> 00:26:03,395
unless they've shown you that they do have specific plans to create versions for those games and those platforms,

445
00:26:03,955 --> 00:26:05,575
and that they're going to cover the cost of doing so.

446
00:26:08,130 --> 00:26:10,071
Rather than locking up those rights to the start,

447
00:26:10,511 --> 00:26:12,792
a more developer-friendly approach

448
00:26:13,492 --> 00:26:15,253
might be to give the publisher a first option

449
00:26:15,573 --> 00:26:17,834
to publish on those platforms or to fund the publishing

450
00:26:18,214 --> 00:26:19,855
and fund the development and publishing

451
00:26:20,015 --> 00:26:22,356
of those ports or console versions.

452
00:26:24,317 --> 00:26:26,638
That means they don't get the rights initially to make them,

453
00:26:26,718 --> 00:26:29,499
but they get first dibs in case they want to fund them

454
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:30,739
or develop them down the line,

455
00:26:31,139 --> 00:26:33,580
or in the event that you want to find an alternative funder

456
00:26:34,041 --> 00:26:36,422
or third-party partner to fund and develop them.

457
00:26:38,952 --> 00:26:41,213
So that's a fair and reasonable approach for both sides,

458
00:26:41,233 --> 00:26:42,733
since the publisher gets a fair chance

459
00:26:42,793 --> 00:26:44,234
to fund those ports at a later date,

460
00:26:45,175 --> 00:26:47,056
presumably once they've seen how well the game is sold

461
00:26:47,116 --> 00:26:48,996
on the initial platform that they're funding you.

462
00:26:49,697 --> 00:26:51,258
But it also allows you as the developer

463
00:26:51,278 --> 00:26:52,798
to explore other options in the event

464
00:26:52,818 --> 00:26:55,960
that the publisher doesn't actually pick that option up

465
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:57,501
and they aren't interested in publishing the game

466
00:26:57,541 --> 00:26:58,241
on those consoles.

467
00:27:03,464 --> 00:27:05,445
If it's agreed that the game will be ported,

468
00:27:05,645 --> 00:27:06,865
then check who's doing the porting.

469
00:27:08,098 --> 00:27:11,179
Do you have the in-house expertise to develop the console versions?

470
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,721
If so, then you might want the first option to develop them and be paid for

471
00:27:15,761 --> 00:27:19,682
doing so rather than the publisher doing this in-house or engaging another third

472
00:27:19,702 --> 00:27:21,183
party to do that development.

473
00:27:23,284 --> 00:27:26,845
If you don't have those expertise, then the publisher might develop these in-house

474
00:27:26,905 --> 00:27:32,427
or they might engage a third party, but check the contract to make sure that it

475
00:27:32,467 --> 00:27:35,468
provides something about the quality of the development of those ports.

476
00:27:37,129 --> 00:27:41,573
As the developer you're going to be providing various warranties and representations and legal promises

477
00:27:42,113 --> 00:27:44,955
about the quality of the game that you're delivering to the publisher.

478
00:27:46,757 --> 00:27:51,560
So if the publisher or its third party partner is going to be porting the game

479
00:27:52,001 --> 00:27:55,623
they should be providing those same legal promises to you about the quality of the ports.

480
00:27:56,940 --> 00:28:01,705
Now they'll want to carve out the quality of the source materials and source code that you provide them

481
00:28:02,265 --> 00:28:05,768
but everything else that goes into the port is going to be their responsibility

482
00:28:06,009 --> 00:28:08,931
therefore they should be responsible for guaranteeing its quality.

483
00:28:10,913 --> 00:28:13,696
So most publishing contracts won't include that as standard

484
00:28:13,876 --> 00:28:17,079
so be sure to ask a publisher to include that or add it in yourself.

485
00:28:18,278 --> 00:28:21,319
The worst case is the publisher or its third party partner

486
00:28:21,339 --> 00:28:24,920
develops buggy ports, they don't review very well,

487
00:28:25,580 --> 00:28:26,940
and effectively tank sales

488
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,521
across all of the other platforms.

489
00:28:29,701 --> 00:28:30,381
It's not your fault,

490
00:28:30,761 --> 00:28:32,582
and it's unlikely that you can do anything about it,

491
00:28:33,102 --> 00:28:34,743
and it's unlikely you can get out of the contract

492
00:28:36,143 --> 00:28:38,324
because those provisions won't be added in the standard.

493
00:28:38,824 --> 00:28:40,384
And that's something generally that I've seen

494
00:28:41,284 --> 00:28:42,825
when a developer has come to me too late.

495
00:28:43,345 --> 00:28:44,125
It's really sad to see.

496
00:28:46,944 --> 00:28:52,350
Next, contract killer number four. Still bad license terms, and hopefully this shows you

497
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:55,994
how much there is to think about when it actually comes to looking at the publishing license and

498
00:28:56,034 --> 00:29:01,580
what it covers. In reality a publishing license is likely to extend beyond just your game.

499
00:29:02,581 --> 00:29:07,146
For example, many publishing licenses include rights over merchandise such as the game's soundtrack.

500
00:29:09,104 --> 00:29:10,624
But it might also include other things as well.

501
00:29:10,784 --> 00:29:13,026
So it might include rights to publish future games,

502
00:29:14,026 --> 00:29:15,747
like sequels or prequels, for example,

503
00:29:15,847 --> 00:29:17,268
games set in the same universe.

504
00:29:19,689 --> 00:29:20,929
But it might also include

505
00:29:21,310 --> 00:29:23,010
just the next game you make, Full Stop.

506
00:29:26,852 --> 00:29:28,973
So if a publishing license is exclusive

507
00:29:29,233 --> 00:29:31,194
and that prevents you from doing certain things,

508
00:29:31,695 --> 00:29:33,555
then your publisher should be able to justify

509
00:29:33,595 --> 00:29:35,776
exactly how they want to use the rights they're taking.

510
00:29:36,918 --> 00:29:39,899
So some additional things to check through

511
00:29:40,399 --> 00:29:43,200
in respect of a publishing license scope are as follows.

512
00:29:45,021 --> 00:29:46,421
Sequels, prequels, and spin-offs.

513
00:29:47,722 --> 00:29:49,902
Does the publishing license extend to other games

514
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:51,723
that you might develop in the future, like these?

515
00:29:53,983 --> 00:29:55,904
Does the publisher even have a plan to publish these

516
00:29:56,084 --> 00:29:58,145
in the future, like now or in the future?

517
00:29:58,925 --> 00:30:00,245
If not, then why lock them up?

518
00:30:02,286 --> 00:30:04,266
If a publisher does want to lock down future games,

519
00:30:05,207 --> 00:30:07,789
or thinks that a game might turn into a franchise,

520
00:30:08,149 --> 00:30:10,451
then there's a couple of developer-friendly ways

521
00:30:11,152 --> 00:30:11,872
to go about this.

522
00:30:13,293 --> 00:30:15,335
The first off is a writer-first refusal,

523
00:30:16,235 --> 00:30:17,696
or first option it might be called.

524
00:30:17,716 --> 00:30:19,758
So to recap that,

525
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,899
it doesn't give the publisher the right straight away

526
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,300
to develop these future games,

527
00:30:23,781 --> 00:30:25,682
but it does give them the first in line

528
00:30:26,223 --> 00:30:27,844
or first opportunity to fund them

529
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,985
and publish them if they want at a later date.

530
00:30:32,387 --> 00:30:35,110
They might also, especially for some larger publishers,

531
00:30:35,150 --> 00:30:37,273
they might want an option to acquire the game IP.

532
00:30:37,473 --> 00:30:39,375
So scrapping the exclusive license

533
00:30:39,455 --> 00:30:41,177
and going to the assignment we talked about earlier.

534
00:30:44,081 --> 00:30:44,822
They might want to do that

535
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:46,524
so that they can control the franchise

536
00:30:46,584 --> 00:30:48,246
and create future games.

537
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,669
You know, and they might see a real value in doing that.

538
00:30:51,833 --> 00:30:53,555
So similarly to the right of first refusal,

539
00:30:54,235 --> 00:30:56,297
the option is likely to be framed as a way

540
00:30:56,537 --> 00:30:58,439
of ensuring that the publisher is first in line

541
00:30:58,459 --> 00:30:59,941
should you decide to sell the IP

542
00:31:00,361 --> 00:31:02,483
or work with someone else to do something with it.

543
00:31:04,405 --> 00:31:06,807
Alternatively, it might just be a way

544
00:31:06,867 --> 00:31:08,709
that the developer has a right to negotiate you,

545
00:31:09,110 --> 00:31:11,132
negotiate with you about buying the IP

546
00:31:11,852 --> 00:31:13,073
during the term of the contract.

547
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:23,549
And neither that right of first refusal or the option to buy your IP should continue or last beyond the term of the publishing agreement.

548
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:31,475
So include and also include a time limit on the period of negotiations in respect of the right of first refusal and the option as well.

549
00:31:31,975 --> 00:31:40,361
That's going to keep both sides honest, and it prevents negotiations dragging on indefinitely that are another way of locking your rights and preventing you actually doing what you want to do.

550
00:31:44,072 --> 00:31:52,355
You should also check if the contract includes other restrictions that might prevent you from developing or releasing future projects, either indefinitely or for a limited time.

551
00:31:54,035 --> 00:32:02,518
Anything that stops you from doing something on an ongoing basis should be reduced or cut down to a defined period, so you know those restrictions are going to end at some point.

552
00:32:04,199 --> 00:32:11,202
The restriction shown here is aimed at protecting the publisher's investment in you and is to prevent you from leasing a similar game.

553
00:32:14,615 --> 00:32:19,457
You just need to check the scope of this restriction, or these sorts of restrictions that you might find in your contract.

554
00:32:20,317 --> 00:32:25,538
In this case it's pretty broad. It includes not making a game in the same genre.

555
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:30,459
So these restrictions are only to preserve the publisher's sales of the game.

556
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:36,841
That is in your interest too, but if the restrictions are too broad then you should ask them to be changed.

557
00:32:39,982 --> 00:32:42,364
Check what the publishing license also actually attaches to.

558
00:32:42,564 --> 00:32:46,468
Does it include other rights like merchandise, the soundtrack, or film TV rights?

559
00:32:47,468 --> 00:32:50,671
In some cases, the definition of game might also refer to merchandise,

560
00:32:51,312 --> 00:32:53,454
or ancillary products, or something similar.

561
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:58,138
These might be subject to the same exclusive publishing license.

562
00:32:58,619 --> 00:33:01,762
And as we've drilled to death already in this talk,

563
00:33:01,902 --> 00:33:04,324
exclusive also means that you can't do anything with them.

564
00:33:07,356 --> 00:33:11,040
In some cases you might be fine with these rights being in the publisher's hands

565
00:33:11,981 --> 00:33:14,543
however in each case you should know what the publisher plans to do with it

566
00:33:15,084 --> 00:33:17,126
and do they actually have any plans to use them.

567
00:33:18,667 --> 00:33:21,590
Also if you've already signed deals, merch deals with companies

568
00:33:21,950 --> 00:33:23,212
prior to signing with the publisher

569
00:33:24,493 --> 00:33:27,215
then your exclusive licence with the publisher might also cut across that

570
00:33:28,417 --> 00:33:32,100
and it might put you in breach of the other deals you might have already signed.

571
00:33:34,339 --> 00:33:44,496
So you might need to carve those out or carve it out with the publisher or just give the publisher non-exclusive rights so that you haven't harmed their rights, they still have some rights to use it.

572
00:33:44,876 --> 00:33:47,561
But you make sure you're under breach of any other contracts you've signed.

573
00:33:49,692 --> 00:33:55,098
Another option that we often see now is that, especially indie developers, might grant rights

574
00:33:55,198 --> 00:34:01,224
to the composer of the game's soundtrack so that they can release the game or benefit

575
00:34:01,244 --> 00:34:05,589
from a revenue share from sales of the game's soundtrack, or allow the composer to sell

576
00:34:05,629 --> 00:34:09,673
the game's soundtrack or distribute it via their own channels, whether that's on Spotify,

577
00:34:09,713 --> 00:34:11,735
Bandcamp, Soundcloud, or something similar.

578
00:34:13,250 --> 00:34:16,853
So if you do have those terms already agreed, then you again, you need to make sure that

579
00:34:16,893 --> 00:34:18,494
you don't cut across them with the publisher.

580
00:34:18,815 --> 00:34:20,176
Just make sure that the publisher is aware.

581
00:34:20,937 --> 00:34:24,600
It's highly likely that you can come to some arrangement whereby both sides are happy.

582
00:34:27,122 --> 00:34:30,685
And also check whether the scope of ancillary products includes film and TV rights.

583
00:34:31,390 --> 00:34:32,291
that relate to the game.

584
00:34:33,131 --> 00:34:34,932
Does the publisher have any plans to use these?

585
00:34:35,613 --> 00:34:37,414
If not, then just ask to remove them.

586
00:34:38,254 --> 00:34:40,796
The publisher can also always ask for a right

587
00:34:40,836 --> 00:34:42,577
of first refusal like we just talked about.

588
00:34:42,657 --> 00:34:44,358
So if you do plan to use them in the future,

589
00:34:44,818 --> 00:34:46,139
or if they want to use them in the future,

590
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:47,320
they can always come back and ask,

591
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,781
and you come back and negotiate for them.

592
00:34:54,264 --> 00:34:56,465
So now that we've looked at bad license terms,

593
00:34:56,925 --> 00:34:58,946
let's turn our attention to how you actually get paid.

594
00:35:00,328 --> 00:35:02,148
So the primary reason for most developers

595
00:35:02,168 --> 00:35:04,309
wanting publisher support is access to funding.

596
00:35:05,030 --> 00:35:06,450
That might be cash during development

597
00:35:06,590 --> 00:35:08,091
so that you can actually help finish your game

598
00:35:08,911 --> 00:35:10,411
or so, you know, helps pay the rent,

599
00:35:10,832 --> 00:35:12,412
helps you eat and live.

600
00:35:14,553 --> 00:35:16,514
And we'll refer to these development payments

601
00:35:16,534 --> 00:35:18,534
that you receive prior to the launch of your game

602
00:35:18,634 --> 00:35:19,535
as front-end payments.

603
00:35:20,575 --> 00:35:23,376
But obviously publishers also have a great marketing reach.

604
00:35:23,396 --> 00:35:24,677
So they might also be providing

605
00:35:24,717 --> 00:35:26,317
with revenue payments as well.

606
00:35:26,817 --> 00:35:27,418
That being...

607
00:35:28,444 --> 00:35:33,726
revenues generated from the sales of your game and we'll call these back-end payments. So for

608
00:35:33,746 --> 00:35:39,229
this section we'll look at those bad payment terms that might affect how you get paid during development.

609
00:35:42,571 --> 00:35:47,574
So what are front-end payments? So as I've just alluded to, these front-end payments are made by

610
00:35:47,594 --> 00:35:52,517
a publisher to you during development. They usually come in the form of development fees, development

611
00:35:52,577 --> 00:35:57,560
advances, but you might also see them referred to as guarantees or MG, something like that.

612
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:00,978
So for simplicity, I'm just going to refer to them as front-end payments.

613
00:36:01,478 --> 00:36:04,081
That being fees you received prior to the release of your game.

614
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:07,924
Now, it's unusual for a publisher just

615
00:36:07,944 --> 00:36:11,307
to hand over cash to you without any sort of control in place.

616
00:36:12,187 --> 00:36:15,230
So as such, front-end payments are going to be tied to a couple of things.

617
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:19,974
That will be your obligation to develop and deliver certain builds or milestones.

618
00:36:21,499 --> 00:36:27,487
and they will almost certainly be tied to the publisher's approval of those builds or milestones that you've delivered.

619
00:36:28,087 --> 00:36:36,258
So you're only going to receive a front-end payment in respect of that build and milestone once you've actually delivered it and once the publisher has signed off on it.

620
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,623
So how is this dealt with in the contract?

621
00:36:40,889 --> 00:36:42,990
So most publishing contracts will have terms

622
00:36:43,470 --> 00:36:46,172
outlining the delivery evaluation feedback mechanism

623
00:36:46,392 --> 00:36:47,032
and requirements.

624
00:36:47,532 --> 00:36:50,494
For example, your delivery of a particular milestone

625
00:36:50,914 --> 00:36:53,095
or build is going to be tied to dates in the contract,

626
00:36:53,515 --> 00:36:57,257
most likely linked or listed in a milestone schedule

627
00:36:57,597 --> 00:36:59,158
or delivery schedule or something similar.

628
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,299
There should then be a mechanic

629
00:37:02,659 --> 00:37:03,740
that provides for the publisher

630
00:37:03,780 --> 00:37:05,141
to review that milestone or build.

631
00:37:05,961 --> 00:37:07,222
And they'll either approve it

632
00:37:07,382 --> 00:37:08,382
and that will trigger payment.

633
00:37:09,086 --> 00:37:13,427
or they reject it, whereupon the developer, you will have to implement fixes

634
00:37:13,747 --> 00:37:17,929
and then resubmit the build to the publisher, whereupon that whole process begins again.

635
00:37:20,129 --> 00:37:22,710
But what happens if you don't get publisher approval?

636
00:37:25,051 --> 00:37:29,472
Well, there might be valid reasons why a publisher has rejected a milestone. For example, it doesn't

637
00:37:29,512 --> 00:37:33,554
comply with the agreed specification or the build requirements that have been set out in the

638
00:37:33,594 --> 00:37:38,275
milestone schedule. However, what if issues are there that aren't your fault?

639
00:37:39,427 --> 00:37:45,173
An absolute publishing agreement classic is not accounting for delays that are caused by the publisher.

640
00:37:46,835 --> 00:37:56,545
And that would be, or can be caused, especially where there's no timing specified for the publisher to perform certain actions, such as reviewing the bill that you've just delivered.

641
00:37:58,126 --> 00:38:01,868
This can be a major issue, especially if the publisher's

642
00:38:01,908 --> 00:38:03,489
delay in carrying out their obligations

643
00:38:03,949 --> 00:38:05,831
is going to affect your ability to get paid.

644
00:38:05,851 --> 00:38:09,293
It's also grossly unfair, because you can see the knock-on effect.

645
00:38:09,853 --> 00:38:10,834
You deliver a build.

646
00:38:10,934 --> 00:38:13,335
You're waiting for the publisher to sign off on it.

647
00:38:13,375 --> 00:38:14,175
They don't sign off.

648
00:38:14,716 --> 00:38:15,576
You don't get the money.

649
00:38:16,177 --> 00:38:18,198
You then can't finish the next build,

650
00:38:18,358 --> 00:38:20,419
because you haven't had the money to develop it.

651
00:38:21,000 --> 00:38:22,981
And then you're in breach of the contract for not

652
00:38:23,021 --> 00:38:24,061
delivering that next build.

653
00:38:24,922 --> 00:38:29,424
So again, that's going to then put you in breach of contract and it's not your fault.

654
00:38:29,784 --> 00:38:35,867
And how is that fair? So how can this be solved? So to avoid delays that aren't your fault,

655
00:38:36,507 --> 00:38:40,548
you can put time limits on the publisher to perform certain tasks. In particular,

656
00:38:40,588 --> 00:38:43,790
there are obligations around evaluation and approval of builds and milestones.

657
00:38:44,550 --> 00:38:50,032
This is completely normal practice and publishers are generally amenable to having a reasonable

658
00:38:50,072 --> 00:38:51,573
amount of time to review each milestone.

659
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:54,651
normally 10 working days.

660
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,434
But if a mechanism like this isn't in the contract,

661
00:38:59,454 --> 00:39:00,554
then be sure to add it in.

662
00:39:04,076 --> 00:39:06,457
But what happens if you still haven't received a response

663
00:39:06,518 --> 00:39:07,758
after that time limit is up?

664
00:39:09,019 --> 00:39:11,320
Well, it's also common practice for a developer

665
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,161
to ask for automatic approval

666
00:39:13,201 --> 00:39:15,883
if the developer hasn't given his approval or rejection

667
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,103
within the agreed time limit.

668
00:39:18,367 --> 00:39:29,090
That will be approval for the purposes of payment only, I might add, but it's usually a fair compromise because it means that you can get paid and you can invoice for the next milestone and start working on that.

669
00:39:29,670 --> 00:39:38,773
But it also allows the publisher for you to also allows the publisher to ask you to make changes or fixes to that build in the event that it's broken all those bugs that need fixing.

670
00:39:44,098 --> 00:39:49,762
Publishers should also not be rejecting milestones or builds that meet the agreed specification or delivery schedule.

671
00:39:50,303 --> 00:39:52,665
That is, they shouldn't just be arbitrarily rejecting builds.

672
00:39:53,746 --> 00:40:01,211
So if it isn't already included in your contract, then you need to be sure to add in a requirement on them to provide reasonably detailed feedback where there is any rejection.

673
00:40:02,693 --> 00:40:07,436
The whole point of the evaluation and review process is so that the development of the game stays on track.

674
00:40:08,797 --> 00:40:12,160
And the publisher will guide that development in the event that it goes off course.

675
00:40:13,967 --> 00:40:15,748
So any feedback or rejection that they give

676
00:40:16,989 --> 00:40:18,751
needs to be sufficient or should be sufficient

677
00:40:19,632 --> 00:40:21,974
for you to be able to make the necessary changes to the build

678
00:40:23,415 --> 00:40:26,538
in order for it to comply with the agreed specification delivery schedule.

679
00:40:29,221 --> 00:40:32,444
The publisher shouldn't also change the agreed scope or specification

680
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:35,387
of any deliverables once that's been fixed.

681
00:40:36,948 --> 00:40:37,048
So...

682
00:40:38,192 --> 00:40:44,376
It's good practice for the parties to agree the specification and milestone deliverables at the start before anything happens.

683
00:40:46,177 --> 00:40:52,842
You might also have a more agile process whereby the next builders agree between the parties once you've delivered the next milestone.

684
00:40:53,422 --> 00:40:58,205
That's also fine, but make sure that the negotiation process is fair and they are adding any

685
00:40:59,347 --> 00:41:04,913
and they aren't adding any unreasonable features that require more time, money or resources for you to actually implement

686
00:41:05,573 --> 00:41:10,058
so check if you've got the creative control and vision of the game that you have control over that

687
00:41:13,883 --> 00:41:17,326
if a publisher wants to make changes to the agreed specification or delivery schedule

688
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:19,969
then this should naturally require your approval

689
00:41:21,085 --> 00:41:25,248
As of all of them, any changes that require more time, money or resource,

690
00:41:25,268 --> 00:41:28,410
that being, you need to bring more people onto the project to help,

691
00:41:29,031 --> 00:41:31,252
should be seen as outside of the agreed specification.

692
00:41:32,613 --> 00:41:34,835
That's not to say you and the publisher can't agree those changes

693
00:41:34,855 --> 00:41:35,856
at a later date if you want,

694
00:41:36,576 --> 00:41:39,779
but you should be ensured that you're paid for any extra work or deliverables.

695
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:42,821
And that would normally require an amendment to the contract

696
00:41:43,181 --> 00:41:46,224
to adjust the agreed spec and reflect the fact

697
00:41:46,244 --> 00:41:48,025
that you're going to get paid a bit more in order to do it.

698
00:41:50,292 --> 00:41:55,498
To avoid this scope creep, you want to make sure that the contract should include a change mechanism in order to avoid that.

699
00:41:56,259 --> 00:42:03,266
And that scope creep term is normally associated with freelance or work-for-hire arrangements, but it can also play a part in publishing agreements too.

700
00:42:07,831 --> 00:42:11,375
And you need to check the timings in cash flow and how long it is going to take you to get paid.

701
00:42:12,675 --> 00:42:18,098
One of the final points of this section is to understand how long it takes for the publisher

702
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:22,721
to actually send you the money, and then how long it's actually going to be until it hits

703
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:23,401
your bank account.

704
00:42:24,522 --> 00:42:26,543
So always check the payment terms of any contract.

705
00:42:27,624 --> 00:42:30,606
The payment terms are the length of time that the publisher takes to make a payment.

706
00:42:31,366 --> 00:42:35,089
In particular, you need to make sure that this doesn't leave you in a bad cash flow

707
00:42:35,129 --> 00:42:35,469
position.

708
00:42:37,154 --> 00:42:41,335
An example of a standard payment term might be 30 days from publishers approval of a milestone.

709
00:42:42,076 --> 00:42:46,257
So that means once the milestone has been approved, then you still have to wait 30 days

710
00:42:46,277 --> 00:42:47,517
for the money to hit your bank account.

711
00:42:48,818 --> 00:42:52,099
If we take a step back as well, and if you factor in the fact that a publisher might

712
00:42:52,119 --> 00:42:56,240
have 10 working days to approve a milestone or review a milestone, then there might be

713
00:42:56,280 --> 00:43:01,162
additional time added on until you actually get the money from the publisher, especially

714
00:43:01,202 --> 00:43:02,942
if there's been a round of reviews or fixes.

715
00:43:03,503 --> 00:43:06,003
So make sure that this doesn't leave you in a bad cash flow position.

716
00:43:07,535 --> 00:43:10,738
If the publisher's payment terms are too long, then ask if they'll change them.

717
00:43:11,599 --> 00:43:15,543
You shouldn't put yourself in a bad financial position, and most publishers are happy to

718
00:43:15,583 --> 00:43:19,807
move milestones around to make sure that you aren't left in the lurch, and make sure you

719
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:21,569
do have money to live while you're making the game.

720
00:43:25,192 --> 00:43:25,913
So contract killer number 6.

721
00:43:25,953 --> 00:43:29,456
So we're still looking at bad payment terms, but this time on the back end.

722
00:43:30,297 --> 00:43:32,780
That being money that the publisher pays to you once the game is released.

723
00:43:34,245 --> 00:43:37,347
So backend payments are usually in the form of a revenue share,

724
00:43:37,547 --> 00:43:40,389
but you might also see it called royalties, profit share,

725
00:43:40,949 --> 00:43:43,871
or distributed earnings, or something similar like that.

726
00:43:44,672 --> 00:43:46,333
Essentially, it's a percentage of the revenues

727
00:43:46,353 --> 00:43:48,294
that the publisher has received from selling your game.

728
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,879
But backend payments should factor in.

729
00:43:59,017 --> 00:44:03,540
any money that the publisher has received in respect of or revenues attributed to your game.

730
00:44:03,660 --> 00:44:09,384
So not just sales of the game itself, especially if the publishing license includes more than just

731
00:44:09,424 --> 00:44:14,368
game sales, it should include money that the publisher has received from other sources as well

732
00:44:14,908 --> 00:44:18,491
such as cash from exclusivity deals. So for example if they've signed a deal with

733
00:44:19,051 --> 00:44:22,573
for the Epic Game Store or Xbox Game Pass for example.

734
00:44:24,283 --> 00:44:30,610
If your game includes this functionality, then it should also include in-game purchases or in-game advertising.

735
00:44:32,832 --> 00:44:39,239
If merchandise is caught by the publishing license, then you'd also expect revenues from merch sales to be included in this definition too.

736
00:44:40,100 --> 00:44:45,345
And don't forget, if they've got the film and TV rights, you should make sure that you're paid if they ever use them or utilize them.

737
00:44:48,455 --> 00:44:52,159
The back-end payment is going to come to you after the publisher has made certain deductions.

738
00:44:52,839 --> 00:44:57,383
So it's unlikely to be a percentage based on the gross revenues that the game has generated,

739
00:44:58,004 --> 00:45:03,909
that being the total amount of money based on number of sales multiplied by the actual sale price of the game.

740
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,275
Far more likely is that any back-end revenue share is going to be calculated as a percentage of net revenues.

741
00:45:11,016 --> 00:45:15,380
That's the amount that's left over once the publisher has made certain deductions from gross revenue.

742
00:45:17,180 --> 00:45:20,645
So how much does your publisher cost and what deductions are they making?

743
00:45:22,127 --> 00:45:25,532
Publishers are not doing business with you for free and like most businesses,

744
00:45:25,692 --> 00:45:29,177
they will want to make a profit and a publishing agreement gives you an

745
00:45:29,197 --> 00:45:31,701
indication of how they're going to make that profit from you and your game.

746
00:45:33,248 --> 00:45:35,270
So to guarantee a return on their investment,

747
00:45:36,030 --> 00:45:38,532
most publishers will aim to recover their sunk costs incurred

748
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:41,755
in publishing a game before paying any back-end payments.

749
00:45:42,616 --> 00:45:44,498
So the amount and timing of back-end payments

750
00:45:44,578 --> 00:45:47,780
is likely to depend on the value of those publishers' costs.

751
00:45:48,781 --> 00:45:49,942
As such, you need to know exactly

752
00:45:49,982 --> 00:45:51,444
what the publisher is going to be charging you

753
00:45:51,744 --> 00:45:53,425
so you can show that they're paying you correctly.

754
00:45:57,129 --> 00:46:04,071
So to do this, you need to check the definition of permitted deductions or net receipts and net revenues to determine what the publisher's costs are.

755
00:46:05,552 --> 00:46:09,973
So publishing contracts will deal with this and the publisher's costs in different ways.

756
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:18,136
A common example is to have a list of permitted deductions or agreed recoupable costs that the publisher can deduct from gross sales revenue.

757
00:46:19,590 --> 00:46:23,071
An alternative approach is to have a definition of net revenues or net receipts,

758
00:46:24,192 --> 00:46:27,213
that being the amount of money left over once the publisher has deducted its costs.

759
00:46:27,753 --> 00:46:30,754
And in that definition, there should be a list of deductions that they're taking.

760
00:46:32,515 --> 00:46:36,856
In either case, it's not unreasonable for you to ascertain exactly what the publisher's costs are.

761
00:46:37,597 --> 00:46:41,798
And you should be asking for evidence that they've incurred them

762
00:46:41,838 --> 00:46:43,679
and exactly what they've been spending.

763
00:46:46,114 --> 00:46:51,038
If a publisher is providing you with front-end payments or advances, then they'll normally have to recoup those first as well.

764
00:46:52,340 --> 00:46:58,325
Ditto with other publishing costs such as marketing, localization, or QA, depending on what services they're doing for you.

765
00:47:00,086 --> 00:47:10,095
However, if a publisher is looking to recoup any internal costs, particularly relating to marketing, porting, or QA services, then you should query the value of those.

766
00:47:11,352 --> 00:47:17,894
Internal publishing costs can be easily inflated and they might not actually represent good value to you as the developer.

767
00:47:19,254 --> 00:47:26,397
For example, it's reasonable for a developer to ask for a publisher's recoverable marketing costs to be limited to third-party costs only.

768
00:47:27,617 --> 00:47:35,260
That being the cost that the publishers are incurred engaging an external PR or marketing firm to help give the game an extra marketing push before launch.

769
00:47:37,442 --> 00:47:41,805
Publishers should also be able to evidence its incurring of any of these publishing costs.

770
00:47:42,586 --> 00:47:46,710
So ask to see evidence of invoices of third party suppliers so that you can verify that

771
00:47:46,750 --> 00:47:49,672
against the statements or information that the publisher is providing to you.

772
00:47:51,654 --> 00:47:54,717
And as a matter of course, most publishing contracts will include audit provisions

773
00:47:55,297 --> 00:47:58,400
and that will allow you to check the publisher's accounts and sales records

774
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,901
to make sure that you've been paid correctly.

775
00:48:01,191 --> 00:48:03,272
If a term like this isn't included in your contract,

776
00:48:03,652 --> 00:48:04,672
then make sure to add it in.

777
00:48:05,092 --> 00:48:07,793
It is fair and reasonable to make sure that you get paid.

778
00:48:07,953 --> 00:48:09,974
So having an audit provision like this

779
00:48:10,314 --> 00:48:11,214
is seen as customary.

780
00:48:15,756 --> 00:48:16,996
Check your payment terms again.

781
00:48:17,016 --> 00:48:19,457
As with front-end payments,

782
00:48:20,238 --> 00:48:22,138
the publisher will usually set out the timescales

783
00:48:22,178 --> 00:48:23,979
for paying the back-end payments as well.

784
00:48:25,359 --> 00:48:27,500
So again, you need to be sure what these are

785
00:48:27,780 --> 00:48:28,540
and change them if you think

786
00:48:28,580 --> 00:48:29,901
it's gonna cause you cashflow issues.

787
00:48:31,789 --> 00:48:35,771
So in particular, in respect of the timing of back-end payments, you should check the following.

788
00:48:38,854 --> 00:48:41,936
And this might not also be the timing, but also the detail that you're getting as well.

789
00:48:42,436 --> 00:48:45,338
So first off, is the publisher providing you with a royalty statement?

790
00:48:46,754 --> 00:48:50,296
So if they are, it's not unreasonable to ask for them

791
00:48:50,316 --> 00:48:52,318
for you to provide information or a statement

792
00:48:52,338 --> 00:48:55,040
based on revenues on a monthly or quarterly basis.

793
00:48:55,721 --> 00:48:56,922
So they might provide a statement

794
00:48:56,962 --> 00:48:58,323
showing a breakdown of game sales

795
00:48:58,363 --> 00:48:59,884
across platform or territory,

796
00:49:00,385 --> 00:49:02,366
or any other information that you might reasonably ask for.

797
00:49:03,862 --> 00:49:05,603
So if that detail isn't in the contract,

798
00:49:05,623 --> 00:49:07,585
then you can always ask for it to be added in.

799
00:49:08,746 --> 00:49:11,788
And some publishers will have example royalty statements

800
00:49:11,808 --> 00:49:14,511
that they use, and they might provide those to you

801
00:49:14,831 --> 00:49:15,892
before you sign the contract,

802
00:49:15,912 --> 00:49:17,393
so you have an idea of what this looks like.

803
00:49:19,755 --> 00:49:20,936
If you're getting a royalty statement,

804
00:49:20,956 --> 00:49:21,957
then that's all well and good,

805
00:49:22,257 --> 00:49:24,339
but check that the publisher is,

806
00:49:24,740 --> 00:49:26,701
check whether the publisher provides you

807
00:49:26,721 --> 00:49:28,763
with the statement first before it pays you,

808
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,384
or if it pays you at the same time.

809
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:38,506
Because if they're providing the statement to you first, then that might inadvertently extend the amount of time until you actually receive the money in your bank account.

810
00:49:39,087 --> 00:49:45,231
So check that time period in the contract, and then check how long it takes for them to pay you after you've received that statement.

811
00:49:47,362 --> 00:49:51,225
And then you need to calculate how long it's actually going to take for them to actually receive the cash in your bank.

812
00:49:51,825 --> 00:49:58,010
For example, some publishers' payment terms might be 45 days from the end of the month in which they've received revenues.

813
00:49:58,550 --> 00:50:04,455
So you can imagine if they've received revenues on the first of the month, you aren't going to receive that money until 75 days later.

814
00:50:08,938 --> 00:50:14,282
My final point, and it's a big one, and it concerns where the publisher deducts or recoups its costs from.

815
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,468
And by that I mean, how is the publisher actually

816
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:18,389
recovering its costs?

817
00:50:20,289 --> 00:50:22,310
The most common approach taken by publishers

818
00:50:22,390 --> 00:50:23,950
is for them to recover their sunk costs 100%

819
00:50:24,690 --> 00:50:25,510
from gross revenues.

820
00:50:26,851 --> 00:50:30,032
So once they've hit that break-even point

821
00:50:30,072 --> 00:50:32,132
and they've recovered all of their advances in publishing

822
00:50:32,172 --> 00:50:34,953
costs paid to you, then the revenue share split

823
00:50:34,973 --> 00:50:37,373
and the back-end payment share split will happen.

824
00:50:37,794 --> 00:50:39,714
And that's when they'll start paying royalties to you.

825
00:50:41,612 --> 00:50:43,995
However, not all publishing contracts are created equal,

826
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:45,336
so this is something you definitely want

827
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,357
to check in the contract.

828
00:50:47,719 --> 00:50:48,980
And in some worst cases,

829
00:50:49,601 --> 00:50:51,102
and there's plenty of example of publishers

830
00:50:51,122 --> 00:50:51,883
that still do this,

831
00:50:52,564 --> 00:50:55,307
the publisher might look to recover their costs,

832
00:50:55,908 --> 00:50:57,349
including the advances they've paid to you,

833
00:50:57,830 --> 00:50:59,491
from your share of royalties only.

834
00:51:00,944 --> 00:51:02,765
So this is grossly unfair for several reasons,

835
00:51:03,886 --> 00:51:06,288
but namely that one, it ignores all the investment

836
00:51:06,308 --> 00:51:07,309
that you've put into the game

837
00:51:07,329 --> 00:51:08,590
before signing with the publisher.

838
00:51:09,591 --> 00:51:11,392
The publisher makes profit from day one.

839
00:51:12,373 --> 00:51:14,675
It's naturally gonna take you much longer

840
00:51:14,715 --> 00:51:16,096
to receive any backend payments

841
00:51:16,176 --> 00:51:18,679
because the publishers are covering all of their costs

842
00:51:18,699 --> 00:51:20,060
from a smaller pool of revenues.

843
00:51:21,021 --> 00:51:22,502
And last but not least,

844
00:51:22,522 --> 00:51:25,605
but that could also mean that you lead to cashflow issues,

845
00:51:25,985 --> 00:51:28,027
especially if you're relying on these backend payments

846
00:51:28,047 --> 00:51:28,607
to stay afloat.

847
00:51:30,114 --> 00:51:31,755
So while turning down money is hard,

848
00:51:32,296 --> 00:51:34,297
you probably should seriously consider

849
00:51:34,397 --> 00:51:36,699
if a publishing deal is structured in this way

850
00:51:37,139 --> 00:51:38,300
and ask if they will change it

851
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:40,101
to the model that we've said first.

852
00:51:40,702 --> 00:51:41,983
While it still might not be ideal

853
00:51:42,003 --> 00:51:44,444
that a publisher recovers all of its costs first,

854
00:51:45,045 --> 00:51:48,087
especially if you've incurred significant swept equity

855
00:51:49,268 --> 00:51:50,589
or incurred significant costs

856
00:51:50,709 --> 00:51:51,930
prior to signing with a publisher,

857
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,031
it still means that at least

858
00:51:54,132 --> 00:51:55,533
once the publisher's hit break-even,

859
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:56,653
you know you're gonna get paid.

860
00:52:00,610 --> 00:52:02,051
So contract killer number seven,

861
00:52:02,251 --> 00:52:04,572
so to finish off, I wanna look at some of the timing issues

862
00:52:05,032 --> 00:52:06,093
that might affect your ability

863
00:52:06,133 --> 00:52:07,973
to carry out your obligations under the contract.

864
00:52:09,234 --> 00:52:10,414
So we've already looked at delays

865
00:52:10,454 --> 00:52:11,875
that might be caused by a publisher

866
00:52:12,355 --> 00:52:14,156
during the evaluation and review of milestones

867
00:52:15,216 --> 00:52:16,897
and the impact that that delay can have on you

868
00:52:17,317 --> 00:52:19,098
in your ability to receive front-end payments.

869
00:52:19,738 --> 00:52:21,979
So now I'll just look a little bit more generally

870
00:52:22,019 --> 00:52:22,819
about what you can do

871
00:52:23,079 --> 00:52:25,000
so that you're not liable for publisher delays.

872
00:52:28,170 --> 00:52:32,335
So plain and simple, you should not be liable for publisher delays or failures.

873
00:52:33,877 --> 00:52:38,923
This should also extend to any third parties or people or individuals or

874
00:52:39,043 --> 00:52:43,689
outsourcers that the publisher requires you to work with, such as porting houses,

875
00:52:43,729 --> 00:52:44,230
for example.

876
00:52:45,025 --> 00:52:50,452
So a publishing contract is there to protect the publisher more than anything.

877
00:52:51,093 --> 00:52:54,798
But that doesn't mean that you need to be penalized for the developer being

878
00:52:55,078 --> 00:52:59,324
delayed or for if any of their parties that they're partners that they're

879
00:52:59,344 --> 00:53:02,007
working with aren't very good or delay or cause failures.

880
00:53:03,436 --> 00:53:06,718
So this is unlikely to be covered in the contractor standard, so you should add it in.

881
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:10,021
And if there's any publishers listening, then this is a change that you should

882
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:12,722
definitely consider adding so that it's fair and reasonable.

883
00:53:13,343 --> 00:53:16,725
And that is just ensuring that there's something in the contract that says if

884
00:53:16,745 --> 00:53:20,067
there's any, if there's any delays caused by the publisher and it's not the

885
00:53:20,108 --> 00:53:23,530
developer's fault, the developer's obligations just get extended on a day

886
00:53:23,550 --> 00:53:25,811
for day basis until that delay is rectified.

887
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:30,321
just means that the developer can pause its obligations

888
00:53:31,462 --> 00:53:32,942
and it doesn't have to fear that it's

889
00:53:32,962 --> 00:53:34,643
going to be a breach of contract for late delivery

890
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:35,363
or performance.

891
00:53:37,664 --> 00:53:40,364
Now, publishers aren't always at fault for a developer being late

892
00:53:40,444 --> 00:53:41,605
and carrying out its obligations.

893
00:53:43,165 --> 00:53:45,166
In a publishing contract, the obligations for development

894
00:53:45,846 --> 00:53:47,126
ultimately fall on the developer.

895
00:53:48,387 --> 00:53:49,707
But late delivery happens.

896
00:53:49,827 --> 00:53:50,868
Publishers know it happens.

897
00:53:51,668 --> 00:53:53,648
And missing a milestone would normally

898
00:53:53,669 --> 00:53:55,049
be considered a material breach.

899
00:53:56,658 --> 00:54:02,461
But material breaches usually come with a cure period during which time the party at fault can fix any wrongs.

900
00:54:03,161 --> 00:54:08,724
So check the contract to ensure that the contract actually does include a cure period, because it isn't unreasonable to have one.

901
00:54:09,505 --> 00:54:11,786
Especially for late milestone delivery.

902
00:54:12,986 --> 00:54:19,410
You'll normally see if the contract has any cure periods by checking the termination section.

903
00:54:21,271 --> 00:54:25,453
Now a cure period doesn't give you a free pass to deliver builds late.

904
00:54:26,937 --> 00:54:29,098
That's a surefire way to burn bridges with your publisher,

905
00:54:29,639 --> 00:54:31,280
but it is reasonable for you to have time

906
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,201
to fix in areas or late delivery.

907
00:54:36,124 --> 00:54:38,866
And finally, check if timing is of the essence

908
00:54:38,906 --> 00:54:40,667
for delivery of any builds or milestones.

909
00:54:41,348 --> 00:54:42,729
And be careful where a contract states

910
00:54:42,749 --> 00:54:45,331
that delivery of milestones are of the essence.

911
00:54:46,472 --> 00:54:50,893
It's a rather innocuous phrase, but actually it allows the publisher to terminate the agreement

912
00:54:51,194 --> 00:54:52,914
for your breach in the event of late delivery.

913
00:54:53,635 --> 00:54:55,896
And cure periods won't matter or apply on that.

914
00:54:56,416 --> 00:54:59,337
So it's a very powerful right and not really appropriate.

915
00:55:00,718 --> 00:55:01,618
So how do you fix it?

916
00:55:02,338 --> 00:55:06,480
Well, step one, just ask for it to be amended so that missed milestones are material, but

917
00:55:06,520 --> 00:55:07,801
they're not of the essence.

918
00:55:08,561 --> 00:55:11,242
This allows you to benefit from the cure periods we've just discussed.

919
00:55:12,732 --> 00:55:14,413
So where a publisher won't amend this clause,

920
00:55:14,913 --> 00:55:17,273
then the way around it is just to deliver something

921
00:55:17,793 --> 00:55:19,634
on or before the set milestone delivery date.

922
00:55:20,314 --> 00:55:21,554
It doesn't need to be a complete build

923
00:55:21,934 --> 00:55:23,855
and it might not pass the evaluation process,

924
00:55:24,435 --> 00:55:25,495
but it will avoid the publisher

925
00:55:25,515 --> 00:55:27,596
from being able to terminate for late delivery.

926
00:55:28,576 --> 00:55:30,136
So if there are any publishers listening,

927
00:55:31,537 --> 00:55:33,717
just consider removing time of the essence requirements

928
00:55:33,957 --> 00:55:34,718
out of your contract.

929
00:55:35,338 --> 00:55:36,458
Any developer with a good lawyer

930
00:55:36,938 --> 00:55:37,958
is gonna know how to get around it.

931
00:55:41,912 --> 00:55:47,356
And that concludes my talk. So thanks again for coming to Contract Killers on talking

932
00:55:47,376 --> 00:55:52,059
about the legal ins and outs of publishing agreements. The talk should be available again

933
00:55:52,099 --> 00:55:57,183
via the GDC site and you can find the written articles on my Contract Killer series available

934
00:55:57,263 --> 00:56:02,587
on Gamasutra to read for free, so please check those out. I hope you found this session useful

935
00:56:03,007 --> 00:56:06,870
and have more confidence going into your negotiations with the publisher that it's okay to change

936
00:56:06,910 --> 00:56:08,011
certain things in your contract.

937
00:56:09,115 --> 00:56:13,820
If you have any questions or follow ups or want to ask me anything, then please feel

938
00:56:13,840 --> 00:56:19,047
free to contact me on email address or twitter here or any of the contact details I provided

939
00:56:19,147 --> 00:56:19,367
earlier.

940
00:56:20,048 --> 00:56:20,448
Thanks again.
