00:00:13,331 --> 00:00:19,435
Thank you for coming. First, I'd like to introduce our two speakers for today.

2
00:00:30,598 --> 00:00:34,479
I am Shinya Kumazaki, Executive Director of HAL Laboratory.

3
00:00:56,637 --> 00:01:01,502
I worked on Kirby Air Ride as an artist, served as director starting with Kirby Superstar

4
00:01:01,582 --> 00:01:05,687
Ultra, and am now involved with the overall development of the Kirby series as general

5
00:01:05,727 --> 00:01:06,087
director.

6
00:01:06,107 --> 00:01:12,935
Our other speaker is expert director Tatsuya Kamiyama.

7
00:01:20,033 --> 00:01:25,618
We have worked together since the development of Kirby's Return to Dream Land, and he has

8
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:31,624
since been the director on games like Kirby's Blowout Blast and Kirby and the Forgotten

9
00:01:31,664 --> 00:01:31,824
Land.

10
00:01:45,250 --> 00:01:46,991
Today, you're going to be hearing from the two of us.

11
00:01:47,271 --> 00:01:49,172
We've been involved with this series for many years,

12
00:01:49,252 --> 00:01:50,632
and I hope you enjoy our presentation.

13
00:01:50,652 --> 00:02:06,277
In 2022, the Star Wall series will celebrate its 30th anniversary.

14
00:02:06,297 --> 00:02:12,860
This is a game series with a long history, which was inherited by the predecessors.

15
00:02:15,048 --> 00:02:21,891
We would like to pay tribute to the many developers who created and continued to develop this series.

16
00:02:22,591 --> 00:02:25,672
We celebrated the 30th anniversary of the Kirby series in 2022.

17
00:02:25,972 --> 00:02:30,574
This series has a great deal of history passed down from its early developers.

18
00:02:31,174 --> 00:02:35,856
I'd like to express my respect for the developers who created the series and those who have carried on its legacy.

19
00:02:43,402 --> 00:02:45,623
We decided to take on a new challenge.

20
00:02:46,423 --> 00:02:50,766
To mark this milestone 30th anniversary, we decided to take on a new challenge.

21
00:02:54,148 --> 00:03:01,312
This is the 3D Action Hoshino Kirby Discovery and 2D Action Hoshino Kirby Wii Deluxe.

22
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:06,115
First, I will talk about Hoshino Kirby Discovery.

23
00:03:08,647 --> 00:03:12,709
That challenge was to develop our 3D action game, Kirby and the Forgotten Land,

24
00:03:13,249 --> 00:03:16,351
and our 2D action game, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe.

25
00:03:17,212 --> 00:03:19,293
I'd like to start with Kirby and the Forgotten Land.

26
00:03:23,696 --> 00:03:29,079
Discovery was the first 3D action game.

27
00:03:29,099 --> 00:03:31,221
There was a long road to completion.

28
00:03:31,241 --> 00:03:36,264
But that didn't stop us from developing just one title.

29
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:42,710
Urbi and the Forgotten Land is the first fully 3D action game in the franchise,

30
00:03:43,151 --> 00:03:45,033
and the road to its completion was a long one.

31
00:03:45,894 --> 00:03:48,276
The process went beyond the development of a single title.

32
00:04:03,395 --> 00:04:07,860
We accumulated experience little by little as we developed many different 3D games and modes.

33
00:04:27,182 --> 00:04:29,362
As we dealt with the challenges presented by each game,

34
00:04:29,662 --> 00:04:32,123
we also discussed how we could handle those challenges

35
00:04:32,303 --> 00:04:34,724
if we were to create an action game in the main series.

36
00:04:35,644 --> 00:04:39,325
We finally began development of a fully 3D mainline Kirby game

37
00:04:39,445 --> 00:04:41,526
after the completion of Kirby Star Allies.

38
00:04:45,347 --> 00:04:48,068
We had two themes at the beginning.

39
00:04:48,088 --> 00:04:52,270
The series' theme was to re-examine Kirby.

40
00:04:55,091 --> 00:04:56,252
We began with two themes.

41
00:04:56,793 --> 00:04:59,795
Our theme for the series was taking a fresh look at Kirby.

42
00:05:03,619 --> 00:05:11,146
The theme for the game was a 3D action game anyone can play.

43
00:05:11,166 --> 00:05:13,828
We began our approach by taking a fresh look at Kirby.

44
00:05:24,897 --> 00:05:27,979
I will now think about the personality of Kirby.

45
00:05:27,999 --> 00:05:37,205
His body is as soft as a rubber ball, and he is flexible.

46
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:40,067
Whether he stretches or stretches, he is a very strange being.

47
00:05:40,087 --> 00:05:46,331
I will think about how to make an intuitive 3D action using his Kirby-like personality.

48
00:05:49,091 --> 00:05:50,952
We reconsidered Kirby's characteristics.

49
00:05:51,553 --> 00:05:54,334
Kirby is a strange creature, soft like a rubber ball,

50
00:05:54,635 --> 00:05:57,176
can take on a variety of shapes, and is totally fine

51
00:05:57,276 --> 00:05:58,317
even if stretched or pulled.

52
00:05:59,177 --> 00:06:02,019
We thought about how we could create an intuitive 3D action

53
00:06:02,059 --> 00:06:04,041
game that took advantage of this uniqueness.

54
00:06:07,303 --> 00:06:12,986
We thought about how we could create an intuitive 3D action game that took advantage of this uniqueness.

55
00:06:14,517 --> 00:06:18,082
For example, if you capture a triangle, it transforms into a square.

56
00:06:18,102 --> 00:06:23,088
We aim to capture objects that are easier to understand than mysterious triangles.

57
00:06:29,405 --> 00:06:33,386
With that in mind, we took a more intuitive look at this shapeshifter's characteristics.

58
00:06:34,007 --> 00:06:37,467
For example, by eating a triangular object, Kirby becomes triangular.

59
00:06:38,028 --> 00:06:39,448
And the same goes for something square.

60
00:06:40,208 --> 00:06:44,209
But rather than something mysterious and triangular, we wanted to use familiar objects.

61
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:05,336
By that, I mean objects that exist in real life, like road cones, lockers, or cars.

62
00:07:05,356 --> 00:07:08,318
However, Kirby's not as good at swallowing real life objects.

63
00:07:08,338 --> 00:07:11,240
Kirby's body takes the shape of the object Kirby tries to swallow thanks to a mysterious

64
00:07:11,260 --> 00:07:11,400
power.

65
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:34,952
We used those shapes to push, fly, and roll.

66
00:07:36,434 --> 00:07:39,957
We created intuitive actions that looked like they should.

67
00:07:40,757 --> 00:07:44,841
We then used these shapes to enable Kirby to pierce, fly, and roll,

68
00:07:45,341 --> 00:07:48,384
creating intuitive actions that behaved like they looked like they should.

69
00:07:48,404 --> 00:07:56,651
A new 3D action that took advantage of Kirby's unique features.

70
00:08:00,890 --> 00:08:05,835
And that was how we came up with the new 3D action system, Mouthful Mode, that utilized

71
00:08:05,875 --> 00:08:06,956
Kirby's characteristics.

72
00:08:22,758 --> 00:08:25,639
What's more, the setting for this game would be a new world

73
00:08:25,819 --> 00:08:27,819
filled with the ruins of modern civilization,

74
00:08:28,219 --> 00:08:30,700
where objects from the real world wouldn't feel out of place.

75
00:08:50,463 --> 00:08:53,285
That's right. We didn't start with the visuals or the setting.

76
00:08:53,905 --> 00:08:55,606
Instead, we started with the game design.

77
00:08:56,347 --> 00:09:03,311
Both Mouthful Mode and The New World were conceived in order to create a new kind of 3D action that took advantage of Kirby's flexibility.

78
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:29,334
We wanted players to be comfortable running around in that new world.

79
00:09:30,375 --> 00:09:35,318
Next, we'll hear from Director Kamiyama. He'll be speaking about the trial and error involved

80
00:09:35,358 --> 00:09:38,860
in achieving our goal of making a 3D action game anyone can play.

81
00:09:47,399 --> 00:09:57,847
I'm Kamiyama, and I'd like to introduce some specific examples from Kirby and the Forgotten Land to show what we did to create a 3D action game anyone can play. I hope you find this information useful.

82
00:10:15,088 --> 00:10:17,830
The expectation for Kirby games is that they are fun to play, even for beginners.

83
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,291
We did a variety of things to achieve this, even in 3D action.

84
00:10:42,455 --> 00:10:46,698
Actually, Kirby is not a good fit for 3D.

85
00:10:46,758 --> 00:10:50,560
I think it's best to see what I mean.

86
00:10:51,280 --> 00:10:53,782
First, let's take a look at Kirby's character design.

87
00:10:54,502 --> 00:10:56,984
Honestly, Kirby isn't a good fit for 3D.

88
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,226
I think the fastest way to explain what I mean is to show you.

89
00:11:00,246 --> 00:11:08,290
What do you think this Kirby is facing?

90
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,511
Which direction do you think Kirby is facing here?

91
00:11:13,097 --> 00:11:16,418
The correct answer is this way.

92
00:11:16,438 --> 00:11:22,640
When you rotate a sphere, you can't really tell that it's been rotated.

93
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,001
Kirby has a simple spherical design, so it's difficult to tell which way Kirby is facing

94
00:11:28,021 --> 00:11:28,641
when seen from behind.

95
00:11:47,940 --> 00:11:53,864
For Kirby's ranged attacks, it's a significant issue if the player even slightly misjudges the direction the character is facing.

96
00:11:56,545 --> 00:11:58,807
Kirby sucks in the enemy and then spits them out.

97
00:11:58,847 --> 00:12:02,789
If he misses, he has to find another enemy to suck in, which is a big stress.

98
00:12:05,097 --> 00:12:07,698
Kirby attacks by inhaling enemies and spinning them out.

99
00:12:08,138 --> 00:12:12,480
For this reason, if you miss, you need to look for another enemy to inhale, which is very frustrating.

100
00:12:14,381 --> 00:12:15,841
We used homing to solve this.

101
00:12:15,861 --> 00:12:19,283
While this is a common approach, we also added some twists to it.

102
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,464
Let's talk about these twists.

103
00:12:36,658 --> 00:12:40,559
The first twist is a way to use a point-based system to determine the homing target.

104
00:12:40,579 --> 00:12:47,940
The first category looked at is the direction the character is facing.

105
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,841
The closer the enemy is to that direction, the higher the point value.

106
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:07,675
When an enemy is dangerously close to Kirby, that enemy is assigned additional points.

107
00:13:14,019 --> 00:13:18,101
When there is an important enemy like a boss, that enemy is assigned additional points too.

108
00:13:20,143 --> 00:13:24,545
This way, for Everyone, the condition of the player can be evaluated by scoring, so the game can be a perfect homing.

109
00:13:26,264 --> 00:13:29,126
This allows the homing system to choose the most appropriate target

110
00:13:29,246 --> 00:13:32,047
by evaluating the player's situation via a point-based system.

111
00:13:34,408 --> 00:13:37,129
We also paid attention to selectively ignoring certain targets when homing.

112
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:41,351
When homing is too strong, it robs the players of the fun of aiming.

113
00:13:41,892 --> 00:13:45,574
We also paid attention to selectively ignoring certain targets when homing.

114
00:13:46,094 --> 00:13:49,055
When homing is too strong, it robs the players of the fun of aiming.

115
00:13:51,128 --> 00:13:53,910
We limited the height of the homing range so that the homing doesn't hit airborne enemies

116
00:13:53,950 --> 00:13:54,910
when Kirby is on the ground.

117
00:13:54,930 --> 00:13:59,172
This kind of homing failure feels acceptable when the reason is easy to understand, so

118
00:13:59,192 --> 00:13:59,832
this minimizes frustration.

119
00:13:59,852 --> 00:14:02,273
The problem is that it's hard to grasp the distance in the air, so we compensate it with strong homing.

120
00:14:20,825 --> 00:14:24,227
However, it's especially difficult to get a handle on distance in the air,

121
00:14:24,667 --> 00:14:26,408
so we supported this with strong homing.

122
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:37,874
If it's too obvious that the attack trajectory curves toward the target,

123
00:14:38,034 --> 00:14:39,615
the player will not be motivated to aim.

124
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:44,278
We handled this by using a simple system that splits homing into two stages.

125
00:14:52,078 --> 00:15:01,608
First, we use strong homing only during the first frame, immediately adjusting the projectile

126
00:15:01,668 --> 00:15:02,810
to face in the right direction.

127
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:12,400
After that, we intentionally lower homing performance, making sure the trajectory does

128
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,501
not curve drastically.

129
00:15:20,266 --> 00:15:25,669
This two-stage homing allowed us to make the player feel as if they had aimed at and successfully hit their target.

130
00:15:31,512 --> 00:15:33,993
It's difficult to get a sense of distance in 3D space.

131
00:15:35,614 --> 00:15:38,315
We solved this problem in Forgotten Land by introducing a unique system.

132
00:15:54,701 --> 00:15:57,603
Before explaining our unique system, we wanted to ask the audience,

133
00:15:58,064 --> 00:16:00,326
there's something wrong in this video. Can you tell what it is?

134
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:07,891
You can see what's wrong by changing the angle.

135
00:16:07,911 --> 00:16:11,494
Actually, the attack didn't hit the enemy.

136
00:16:18,117 --> 00:16:19,998
The attack is not actually hitting the enemy.

137
00:16:20,599 --> 00:16:23,781
The attack didn't hit, but the enemy is reacting as though it took damage.

138
00:16:24,202 --> 00:16:25,523
This is our unique system.

139
00:16:39,629 --> 00:16:42,811
Like I said, it's difficult to get a sense of distance in 3D space,

140
00:16:43,131 --> 00:16:45,653
and players would sometimes be frustrated at failing to hit,

141
00:16:45,994 --> 00:16:47,595
even if it appeared to be a bullseye.

142
00:16:48,295 --> 00:16:51,298
Therefore, we made attacks hit when it looked like they should hit.

143
00:16:51,318 --> 00:16:56,262
That doesn't mean we simply made the hitbox bigger.

144
00:16:56,282 --> 00:16:58,864
We extended the hit detection only for depth.

145
00:17:07,680 --> 00:17:12,341
In 3D space, it is difficult to grasp the sense of distance in the direction of the object.

146
00:17:12,361 --> 00:17:16,642
Therefore, we extended the hitbox along the perspective from the camera position

147
00:17:16,662 --> 00:17:19,323
to compensate for the difference in the sense of sight and hitbox.

148
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:23,124
As I mentioned, in a 3D space, it's difficult to get a sense of depth.

149
00:17:23,824 --> 00:17:27,045
Therefore, we extended the hitbox by parsing from the camera position

150
00:17:27,685 --> 00:17:30,986
to correct the discrepancy between the visual feel and the actual hit.

151
00:17:31,006 --> 00:17:36,148
In Discovery, we look at the position of the camera and correct the hitbox in real time.

152
00:17:37,617 --> 00:17:42,443
In Kirby and the Forgotten Land, hit detection is corrected in real-time based on the camera position.

153
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:01,843
One particular pain point for 3D action games is the camera.

154
00:18:02,524 --> 00:18:06,567
It greatly affects the gaming experience and takes a lot of resources to adjust properly.

155
00:18:07,128 --> 00:18:09,970
In addition to this, there was another major hurdle for a Kirby game,

156
00:18:10,370 --> 00:18:12,272
games that even beginners should be able to enjoy.

157
00:18:22,992 --> 00:18:27,876
The player uses the left and right control sticks to control the character and camera simultaneously,

158
00:18:27,896 --> 00:18:30,058
a control scheme that's difficult for beginners.

159
00:18:35,864 --> 00:18:37,685
Unlike side-scrolling 2D action games,

160
00:18:37,725 --> 00:18:40,988
you cannot move the camera to the desired location

161
00:18:41,008 --> 00:18:42,469
unless you operate it properly.

162
00:18:43,090 --> 00:18:46,173
It's also very difficult for them to be aware of the surrounding area.

163
00:18:46,893 --> 00:18:48,775
Unlike side-scrolling 2D action games,

164
00:18:49,095 --> 00:18:50,616
unless you control the camera properly,

165
00:18:50,977 --> 00:18:53,539
you can sometimes miss the elements you need to get through the game.

166
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:56,682
As a solution to this problem,

167
00:18:56,722 --> 00:18:59,624
we decided not to let the player operate the camera.

168
00:19:02,250 --> 00:19:04,952
The level designer sets the optimal camera for the stage.

169
00:19:04,972 --> 00:19:05,833
This is the movement of the camera.

170
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:07,995
The level designer sets the camera when designing the game.

171
00:19:34,407 --> 00:19:35,848
This is how the set camera behaves.

172
00:19:36,389 --> 00:19:39,912
The level designers specify the camera settings as they design the gameplay.

173
00:19:40,533 --> 00:19:42,775
This controls the player's field of view to an extent,

174
00:19:42,976 --> 00:19:46,259
and also allows us to leverage our know-how from 2D action games.

175
00:19:50,029 --> 00:19:55,954
This video is an example of how the camera shifts from being centered on the character to include relevant objects.

176
00:19:56,334 --> 00:20:01,698
This video is an example of how the camera shifts from being centered on the character to include relevant objects.

177
00:20:13,935 --> 00:20:17,638
With this sort of controlled camera, we can design the game so that relevant objects

178
00:20:17,718 --> 00:20:21,681
naturally appear within the field of view, guaranteeing a smooth and comfortable gameplay

179
00:20:21,701 --> 00:20:22,241
experience.

180
00:20:25,483 --> 00:20:27,845
There were other issues that could also be resolved thanks to this kind of camera setup.

181
00:20:27,885 --> 00:20:30,087
One of these was the issue of hovering.

182
00:20:50,266 --> 00:20:53,267
Before we talk about this issue, let me first explain what hovering is.

183
00:20:53,747 --> 00:20:58,549
As you can probably guess, hover is an ability that enables Kirby to fly wherever the player wants.

184
00:20:58,569 --> 00:21:01,270
This is done in 3D space.

185
00:21:01,290 --> 00:21:05,612
This is the most terrifying thing that has ever happened to a game developer.

186
00:21:06,597 --> 00:21:11,500
This ability is used in 3D space. As a developer, can you think of a more terrifying ability?

187
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:19,445
If you allow the player to fly around freely by hovering, they'll want to keep going and going.

188
00:21:19,466 --> 00:21:24,289
But in a game based on completing each level, there are restrictions on how far you can go.

189
00:21:36,455 --> 00:21:42,737
If you don't understand the game unless you try, it will be stressful.

190
00:21:42,938 --> 00:21:46,879
We used a camera to show the player's bad smell.

191
00:21:47,459 --> 00:21:50,381
Not being able to tell whether you can get somewhere until you try

192
00:21:50,601 --> 00:21:53,242
ruins the smooth gameplay experience and can stress out the player.

193
00:21:53,942 --> 00:21:58,184
To resolve this issue, we again used the set camera to hint to the player where they can't go.

194
00:22:01,792 --> 00:22:05,875
Even if you don't go all the way to the edge, you can get the idea that there isn't anything there.

195
00:22:27,571 --> 00:22:32,833
The mechanism behind this camera setting is to first create walls surrounding the course that only the camera can hit.

196
00:22:33,514 --> 00:22:35,394
This placement was mainly done automatically.

197
00:22:55,165 --> 00:23:00,569
Next, we sent radial detection lines out from the focal point of the camera, within the area we want to show.

198
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:05,774
By having this detection occur ahead of where Kirby is, we can smoothly move the camera focus.

199
00:23:05,794 --> 00:23:13,221
In addition, many artistic expressions became possible precisely because of this set camera.

200
00:23:19,506 --> 00:23:22,068
The background was the main focus, and the camera layout

201
00:23:22,128 --> 00:23:24,009
helped to express the world of Kirby.

202
00:23:24,029 --> 00:23:25,770
We aimed to create a 3D action game that anyone could play.

203
00:23:57,667 --> 00:24:03,748
In addition to the creation of Kirby and the Forgotten Land, during this landmark 30th

204
00:24:03,768 --> 00:24:08,650
anniversary, we also developed something that can be considered the roots of the series,

205
00:24:08,970 --> 00:24:13,991
a 2D Kirby title, Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe.

206
00:24:36,176 --> 00:24:39,997
Kirby's Return to Dream Land, released for the Wii, was born at a turning point in the

207
00:24:40,037 --> 00:24:42,078
series, and this is a remake of that title.

208
00:24:54,451 --> 00:24:57,333
Leading up to the original Wii game, Kirby's Return to Dreamland,

209
00:24:57,533 --> 00:25:01,316
there were three experimental titles that were created, starting from the GameCube days.

210
00:25:01,336 --> 00:25:08,882
It was the fourth iteration that finally saw the light of day.

211
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:13,345
This was the first mainline Kirby title for a console in 11 years.

212
00:25:25,392 --> 00:25:32,797
During those 11 years, we continued to iterate on experimentation and development.

213
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:37,319
Because we were determined to not release a title until a certain level of quality was

214
00:25:37,379 --> 00:25:40,581
met, we went through a long period of many growing pains.

215
00:25:54,943 --> 00:26:02,006
And finally, the efforts of the entire staff bore fruit, and Kirby's return to Dream Land was complete.

216
00:26:03,766 --> 00:26:05,667
It became a key title in the history of the series.

217
00:26:19,694 --> 00:26:30,078
Now, I'd like to discuss some of the creative ingenuity that we have been able to accumulate through the history of 2D Kirby titles, using Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe as an example.

218
00:26:44,233 --> 00:26:48,537
KUSHINO KERBY aims to be a series that has approachable yet deep gameplay,

219
00:26:48,597 --> 00:26:51,019
enjoyable to both beginners and veteran players.

220
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:55,583
KUSHINO KERBY aims to be a series that has approachable yet deep gameplay,

221
00:26:55,904 --> 00:26:58,306
enjoyable to both beginners and veteran players.

222
00:27:10,038 --> 00:27:13,100
To this end, we have accumulated a variety of inventive methods,

223
00:27:13,300 --> 00:27:15,762
and these methods are all based on a certain concept.

224
00:27:17,943 --> 00:27:20,505
That concept is, make Kirby the hero.

225
00:27:43,649 --> 00:27:47,790
We want Kirby to be a heroic figure who fights valiantly to defeat his enemies.

226
00:27:48,370 --> 00:27:54,812
In order for Kirby, and by extension the player, to become the hero, we feel it is essential to have controls that feel right.

227
00:27:54,832 --> 00:28:01,593
What is a pleasant operation?

228
00:28:07,743 --> 00:28:09,904
So what do I mean by controls that feel right?

229
00:28:10,584 --> 00:28:14,285
It's not just a matter of matching character movement exactly to button input.

230
00:28:31,345 --> 00:28:36,087
From that fuzzy input we know what the player might want to play

231
00:28:36,227 --> 00:28:41,609
and of these, we move the Kirby as he or she wishes.

232
00:28:41,629 --> 00:28:46,031
We will now explain how to jump as you wish,

233
00:28:46,111 --> 00:28:47,312
using many different mechanisms.

234
00:28:48,842 --> 00:28:53,264
What leads to feeling right is when a character moves exactly the way the player intended.

235
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:57,207
There are times when a player thinks they pressed the button at the right time,

236
00:28:57,387 --> 00:28:59,508
but in reality, the input was a bit off.

237
00:29:00,309 --> 00:29:04,511
From this sort of fuzzy input, we predict what the player intended Kirby to do

238
00:29:04,651 --> 00:29:07,053
and have Kirby behave according to the player's intent.

239
00:29:07,893 --> 00:29:10,855
I'd like to share with you a few of the many mechanisms that demonstrate this.

240
00:29:14,077 --> 00:29:18,099
When you press the jump button in midair, you usually get a hovering effect.

241
00:29:18,994 --> 00:29:22,395
If you press the jump button while in the air, Kirby would usually begin hovering.

242
00:29:22,415 --> 00:29:30,957
However, if the button is pressed just before landing, you may get a situation where the player intended to jump but ends up hovering.

243
00:29:50,042 --> 00:29:56,805
In these situations, we predict the player's intent and make it so Kirby jumps instead of strictly following the button input and hovering.

244
00:29:56,825 --> 00:30:03,427
Even in situations where the player presses the button too late to jump over a pit,

245
00:30:03,447 --> 00:30:05,808
we predict the player's intent and make Kirby jump even in midair.

246
00:30:20,481 --> 00:30:26,245
Even the hit detection on Kirby's head during a jump has been adjusted so that it matches the player's intent.

247
00:30:27,005 --> 00:30:30,047
This is a slow motion video of Kirby jumping during a dash.

248
00:30:54,917 --> 00:30:59,558
At this rate, Kirby's body would come into contact with the enemy first, resulting in taking damage.

249
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:04,940
But, let's see what happens next.

250
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:13,502
Look at that! Kirby was able to defeat the enemy without taking damage.

251
00:31:19,693 --> 00:31:21,554
Let's look at the video again with hit detection displayed.

252
00:31:21,574 --> 00:31:24,654
When Kirby jumps during a dash, the hitbox actually extends a bit toward the direction of the movement.

253
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:57,741
We on the dev team call this Pompadour Detection.

254
00:32:00,422 --> 00:32:03,763
Thanks to this Pompadour Detection, the player is able to jump as they intended.

255
00:32:22,238 --> 00:32:25,639
In addition to these, there are numerous other features that have been implemented.

256
00:32:26,399 --> 00:32:31,680
These are features that support the player behind the scenes, and are designed in such a way that they are not noticeable to the player.

257
00:32:46,502 --> 00:32:49,583
All of this is for the purpose of making the player the hero.

258
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,284
These elements have been inherited and evolved over time

259
00:32:53,484 --> 00:32:54,785
and continue to be improved upon.

260
00:32:54,805 --> 00:33:00,987
Now, I will talk about graphics.

261
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:05,469
We faced the challenge of developing Kirby

262
00:33:05,489 --> 00:33:07,230
while making it move as we wanted.

263
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:12,203
Next, let's talk about graphics.

264
00:33:12,803 --> 00:33:14,383
In the early stages of development,

265
00:33:14,443 --> 00:33:16,664
we also faced challenges in terms of graphics

266
00:33:16,764 --> 00:33:19,224
as we attempted to move Kirby as the player intended.

267
00:33:21,625 --> 00:33:23,465
As a result of aiming for a beautifully evolved graphic,

268
00:33:23,485 --> 00:33:27,106
it became easier to lose track of the character.

269
00:33:27,166 --> 00:33:30,847
In order to make Kirby move as we wanted,

270
00:33:30,927 --> 00:33:34,588
we focused on the fact that the player is a hero

271
00:33:34,668 --> 00:33:35,548
in terms of graphics.

272
00:33:38,105 --> 00:33:40,786
As a result of our goal to beautifully evolve the graphics,

273
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,186
we realized that it became easier to lose track of the characters.

274
00:33:45,047 --> 00:33:47,347
So, keeping our focus firmly on the idea of

275
00:33:47,547 --> 00:33:50,407
the player is the hero, we considered numerous options.

276
00:33:53,248 --> 00:33:56,589
And where we landed was the use of outlines.

277
00:33:57,109 --> 00:33:59,129
And where we landed was the use of outlines.

278
00:34:00,809 --> 00:34:02,069
The character's visibility was greatly improved,

279
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,730
allowing us to move Kirby as we pleased.

280
00:34:07,902 --> 00:34:13,324
However, simply adding outlines would result in a visual that looks like a logo.

281
00:34:13,984 --> 00:34:16,785
This resulted in a vast improvement in character visibility

282
00:34:16,925 --> 00:34:19,966
and ultimately being able to control Kirby as the player intended.

283
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:24,468
But, simply adding outlines would result in a visual that looks like a logo.

284
00:34:26,668 --> 00:34:31,410
We continued exploring ways to outline characters in ways that would really bring out their charm.

285
00:34:31,750 --> 00:34:36,192
We continued exploring ways to outline characters in ways that would really bring out their charm.

286
00:34:42,897 --> 00:34:45,378
We tried using the inverted hull method for outlines,

287
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:52,661
but this resulted in small bits of noise where parts of the character overlapped.

288
00:35:10,981 --> 00:35:13,102
To address this, we used depth value.

289
00:35:13,643 --> 00:35:17,846
By applying gradation to parts of the outline where there were steep variations in depth value,

290
00:35:18,287 --> 00:35:21,209
we were able to create an outline that allows for a sense of depth.

291
00:35:29,570 --> 00:35:34,011
We focused on creating smooth, eye-catching outlines like those in TV anime,

292
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,651
and worked on each issue one by one.

293
00:35:38,371 --> 00:35:41,012
This was the same for complex models besides Kirby.

294
00:35:41,532 --> 00:35:46,533
With our eyes set on smooth and visible outlines, like those you would see in anime characters on TV,

295
00:35:46,933 --> 00:35:48,593
we worked out these issues one by one.

296
00:35:52,194 --> 00:35:56,435
We focused on creating more fun backgrounds and terrain graphics.

297
00:35:57,970 --> 00:36:01,112
We thought that try and error was important

298
00:36:01,152 --> 00:36:03,573
especially for terrain designs involving play.

299
00:36:03,713 --> 00:36:08,876
So we used a decorative editing tool called Cinema

300
00:36:08,896 --> 00:36:10,998
that we developed in-house.

301
00:36:11,938 --> 00:36:14,580
We also worked on the graphics for the background and terrain

302
00:36:14,660 --> 00:36:16,081
to make the game easier to play.

303
00:36:16,661 --> 00:36:18,962
We thought trial and error was particularly important

304
00:36:19,002 --> 00:36:21,324
in designing terrain as it ties into gameplay.

305
00:36:22,024 --> 00:36:24,886
To facilitate this, we used an asset placement tool

306
00:36:24,926 --> 00:36:26,707
called Cinema that we developed in-house.

307
00:36:30,173 --> 00:36:36,217
The part where the designer felt it was difficult to play while moving the game

308
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:40,240
can be fixed and confirmed immediately in real time.

309
00:36:40,260 --> 00:36:47,784
By using this cinema, we were able to create a world that made Kirby's imagination flow efficiently.

310
00:36:49,273 --> 00:36:53,937
Designers were able to play the game, and if at any time the gameplay felt off or cumbersome,

311
00:36:54,217 --> 00:36:56,138
they could edit and test it out in real time.

312
00:36:56,939 --> 00:37:00,102
This allowed them to immediately fix any areas that hindered gameplay.

313
00:37:00,982 --> 00:37:05,726
Using Cinema allowed us to efficiently create a world in which Kirby moves exactly as the player intended.

314
00:37:21,895 --> 00:37:24,657
Next, I'd like to talk about the new modes added to the game.

315
00:37:25,378 --> 00:37:30,382
In order to make this title an even more approachable yet deep game, we created two additional modes.

316
00:37:42,902 --> 00:37:47,523
We wanted to take that idea and put it in the middle of the living room

317
00:37:47,543 --> 00:37:49,904
so that everyone can enjoy it whenever they want.

318
00:37:50,604 --> 00:37:53,805
A major feature in the original Wii game, Kirby's Return to Dream Land,

319
00:37:54,225 --> 00:37:56,526
was its on-the-fly multiplayer functionality

320
00:37:56,626 --> 00:37:59,547
that allowed family and friends to join in the adventure at any time.

321
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:03,789
We wanted to build on that concept and add a mode that could be played together,

322
00:38:04,129 --> 00:38:06,130
anytime, sitting in the middle of the living room.

323
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:10,671
This is Y.Y. Mahoroland.

324
00:38:12,102 --> 00:38:13,842
That mode was Merry Mago Land.

325
00:38:13,862 --> 00:38:21,665
In Merry Mago Land, you'll find a variety of sub-games,

326
00:38:21,766 --> 00:38:24,907
all playable at any time by up to four players.

327
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:28,588
However, we didn't want this to be

328
00:38:28,608 --> 00:38:29,869
just a standalone bonus mode.

329
00:38:43,012 --> 00:38:49,935
We wanted to make a mode that players can play between the action stages and Magoland at any time.

330
00:38:50,795 --> 00:38:55,037
Allowing players to go back and forth between the action stages and Magoland at any time,

331
00:38:55,617 --> 00:38:59,439
our goal was to create something that players would want to play between completing stages.

332
00:39:02,440 --> 00:39:07,282
Which is why we wrapped that mode up into an amusement park called Merry Magoland.

333
00:39:14,367 --> 00:39:17,509
In Theme Park, you can get items that can be used on stage,

334
00:39:17,529 --> 00:39:19,490
such as masks and souvenirs.

335
00:39:19,510 --> 00:39:23,753
You can play a sub-game while you're on the action stage,

336
00:39:23,833 --> 00:39:27,896
and then use the souvenirs you get to conquer the stage again.

337
00:39:27,936 --> 00:39:30,117
This is how the cycle works.

338
00:39:31,833 --> 00:39:34,174
The more games the player plays at the amusement park,

339
00:39:34,394 --> 00:39:36,634
the more dress-up masks and souvenirs they get,

340
00:39:37,094 --> 00:39:38,715
which can be used in the main game stages.

341
00:39:39,375 --> 00:39:41,776
Play a sub-game between completing main game stages,

342
00:39:42,096 --> 00:39:44,677
then take your souvenirs with you back into another stage.

343
00:39:45,237 --> 00:39:47,117
That's the kind of gameplay cycle we implemented.

344
00:39:49,738 --> 00:39:52,599
We've made sure that the flow is comfortable,

345
00:39:52,739 --> 00:39:57,980
and that you can go anywhere with just one button during the adventure.

346
00:39:58,021 --> 00:40:01,121
With these advances, the bigger theme park mode has been completed.

347
00:40:02,049 --> 00:40:04,230
Our goal with the flow of the game was ease.

348
00:40:04,851 --> 00:40:09,114
We made it easy to go back and forth between modes mid-game with the press of a single button.

349
00:40:09,995 --> 00:40:13,818
All these ideas went in together to complete this approachable amusement park mode.

350
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:22,525
Now that we've created this approachable amusement park, I'd like to talk about Magolor.

351
00:40:23,345 --> 00:40:27,168
Now that we've created this approachable amusement park, I'd like to talk about Magolor.

352
00:40:35,719 --> 00:40:39,900
The theme for this section is creating a new character within a long-running series.

353
00:40:43,141 --> 00:40:49,362
When we add characters to the world of Kirby, what's important for us is that the character has the essence that makes them a part of that world.

354
00:40:58,255 --> 00:41:02,357
As you can tell from this sketch, Magolor was built using the fundamental design elements of the series.

355
00:41:02,418 --> 00:41:08,301
We then carefully considered his abilities, role, and personality.

356
00:41:22,597 --> 00:41:24,098
I want to protect him, but I'm also suspicious of him.

357
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,239
By wearing a hood, he has a mysterious design.

358
00:41:26,259 --> 00:41:27,760
In this game, by wearing a part of his costume,

359
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:31,422
he can express a pinch, and other features of his costume are further used.

360
00:41:51,093 --> 00:41:53,775
We gave him a hood to add a touch of mystery to the design.

361
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:59,038
In this game, we leveraged some of the unique characteristics of his outfit, such as parts

362
00:41:59,058 --> 00:42:00,979
of it falling off to denote that he's in trouble.

363
00:42:13,563 --> 00:42:17,887
And despite his voice being a synthesized one, he is still a voiced character, so he

364
00:42:17,927 --> 00:42:21,030
hid his mouth to make it easier to create many conversational scenes.

365
00:42:22,972 --> 00:42:29,678
Incidentally, he is voiced by the sound creator of this game, so on the inside, he's a veteran

366
00:42:29,698 --> 00:42:30,299
composer in his 50s.

367
00:42:40,755 --> 00:42:44,477
Some voices are made by other than Kirby.

368
00:42:45,177 --> 00:42:48,159
A fair amount of voices other than Kirby's are done by other team members.

369
00:42:48,179 --> 00:42:52,841
For example, like King Dedede.

370
00:42:53,461 --> 00:42:55,062
Like, for example, King Dedede.

371
00:43:10,430 --> 00:43:14,971
This is a concept diagram that we drew up when we were creating this game.

372
00:43:15,071 --> 00:43:17,952
It shows the world.

373
00:43:17,992 --> 00:43:21,552
Magolor comes from another world on a ship called the Lore Starcutter and lands on Kirby's

374
00:43:21,572 --> 00:43:21,712
planet.

375
00:43:22,052 --> 00:43:26,093
With that, he gradually starts to open up to Kirby and his friends.

376
00:43:40,613 --> 00:43:49,237
As with the flow of this story, we hope to design him in such a way that despite being suddenly dropped into a series with a long history, he would fit right in.

377
00:43:50,037 --> 00:43:57,480
As with the flow of this story, we hope to design him in such a way that despite being suddenly dropped into a series with a long history, he would fit right in.

378
00:43:57,500 --> 00:44:03,503
This is the path he took to join the world of Kirby.

379
00:44:03,523 --> 00:44:07,985
This is the design proposal for the Wii development.

380
00:44:14,292 --> 00:44:16,673
This is how Magolor came to be in Kirby's world.

381
00:44:17,234 --> 00:44:21,096
These are design proposals from the Wii-era development of Kirby's Return to Dream Land.

382
00:44:21,777 --> 00:44:23,678
Many team members drew countless designs.

383
00:44:26,259 --> 00:44:28,521
Ultimately, we arrived at the current design,

384
00:44:28,541 --> 00:44:33,304
which preserves the spirit of the series while also adding new elements of individuality.

385
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:49,022
We also went through the same kind of trial and error for Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe.

386
00:44:49,442 --> 00:44:53,523
We also went through the same kind of trial and error for Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe.

387
00:45:07,777 --> 00:45:10,058
This is all concept art for Merry Magoland.

388
00:45:10,659 --> 00:45:12,680
Our goal was to summarize the overall mode

389
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:14,781
through symbolic buildings and make it possible

390
00:45:14,821 --> 00:45:17,423
to see all the doors to the many sub-games at a glance.

391
00:45:21,145 --> 00:45:23,806
We are constantly incorporating new things

392
00:45:23,846 --> 00:45:24,527
as we continue the series.

393
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:27,969
But we are finally able to create something

394
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,370
that will become the number one in Kirby's world

395
00:45:30,390 --> 00:45:32,951
based on its role and personality.

396
00:45:34,837 --> 00:45:37,820
As we continue the series, we are always incorporating new things.

397
00:45:38,321 --> 00:45:42,045
But when we do, it's not until we consider their roles and characteristics

398
00:45:42,225 --> 00:45:43,987
and brainstorm many design proposals

399
00:45:44,407 --> 00:45:47,590
that something that will become a part of the world of Kirby is finally born.

400
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:53,176
In addition to the wide theme park mode I introduced,

401
00:45:53,196 --> 00:45:57,120
we also created a mode that allows you to feel the depth.

402
00:45:58,813 --> 00:46:02,636
In this game, in addition to the approachable amusement park mode that we introduced,

403
00:46:02,996 --> 00:46:07,179
we also created a mode where players can really feel the sense of depth that we mentioned before.

404
00:46:07,199 --> 00:46:12,622
That mode is the Magolor Epilogue.

405
00:46:27,565 --> 00:46:33,129
The Magolor Epilogue becomes available after completing Story Mode and is a mode that offers a greater challenge.

406
00:46:33,769 --> 00:46:36,491
I'll start with a brief overview of the game system for this mode.

407
00:46:38,892 --> 00:46:43,595
In this mode, you collect magic points and use them to enhance your character's abilities.

408
00:46:50,239 --> 00:46:54,340
The story is linked to the story of a lost mage who seeks his revival.

409
00:46:54,360 --> 00:46:59,222
This increases the player's motivation for adventure and the sense of accomplishment.

410
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:04,343
However, this is only a superficial reason.

411
00:47:06,084 --> 00:47:11,065
The main goal is to make a game that is more profound than Kirby Wii Deluxe

412
00:47:11,145 --> 00:47:13,526
and a different kind of play experience from the original.

413
00:47:14,242 --> 00:47:18,784
This game system is tied to a story in which Magolor has lost his powers and wants to get

414
00:47:18,824 --> 00:47:19,185
them back.

415
00:47:19,885 --> 00:47:23,507
This increases the player's motivation to go on this adventure and makes it easier for

416
00:47:23,547 --> 00:47:24,668
them to buy into the premise.

417
00:47:25,148 --> 00:47:27,210
However, that's really just a secondary reason.

418
00:47:27,670 --> 00:47:32,833
Our main goal was to give Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe more depth of play by providing

419
00:47:32,893 --> 00:47:34,795
something different from the main game experience.

420
00:47:46,671 --> 00:47:50,994
While we balance the game for experienced Kirby players, the highly flexible enhancement

421
00:47:51,034 --> 00:47:53,696
system allows players to control the level of difficulty.

422
00:47:57,098 --> 00:48:00,640
One of the elements that makes up this game system is the combo system.

423
00:48:06,725 --> 00:48:10,288
The more combos you connect, the more reward points you get from defeating an enemy.

424
00:48:31,121 --> 00:48:34,583
The word combo might make it sound like the game has a high threshold for entry,

425
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:38,185
but we worked to make the game both approachable and deep here, too.

426
00:48:38,726 --> 00:48:41,067
We put in a little secret sauce to make combos fun.

427
00:48:44,949 --> 00:48:48,051
Magolor's attacks use two different kinds of hit detection.

428
00:49:00,582 --> 00:49:05,725
The combo detection only hits when the enemy has been hit once.

429
00:49:06,486 --> 00:49:12,090
The red circle shows the hitbox for a regular attack, and the purple shows the area used for combo detection.

430
00:49:12,910 --> 00:49:17,834
This combo detection area is only used for follow-up attacks when an enemy has already been hit once.

431
00:49:20,656 --> 00:49:23,778
The game plays with a video that is not displayed in the combo detection.

432
00:49:25,848 --> 00:49:29,869
As you can see, it's easy to hit the enemy you knock back.

433
00:49:29,889 --> 00:49:35,911
This is an example of a small feature that supports the player.

434
00:49:36,591 --> 00:49:37,671
Here we have two videos.

435
00:49:38,211 --> 00:49:40,472
One with the hit detection displayed and one without.

436
00:49:41,232 --> 00:49:43,873
As you can see, it makes it easier to land hits on enemies

437
00:49:44,053 --> 00:49:45,673
even if they've already been knocked back.

438
00:49:46,353 --> 00:49:49,934
This is another example of a subtle feature that supports the player behind the scenes.

439
00:49:54,365 --> 00:50:01,690
There are also various other features that support the player from behind the scenes.

440
00:50:01,730 --> 00:50:07,054
Even though the Magolor Epilogue mode is more challenging, we made sure to make the player

441
00:50:07,074 --> 00:50:07,635
the hero of the mode.

442
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:27,743
Everyone can become a hero and become a strong enemy.

443
00:50:27,803 --> 00:50:33,126
In Hoshinokawa Bui Deluxe, everyone, including your parents,

444
00:50:33,146 --> 00:50:36,049
children, and friends, can become a hero.

445
00:50:36,729 --> 00:50:39,651
This mode is also playable by up to four players at a time,

446
00:50:40,011 --> 00:50:43,274
which means that everyone can become the hero and battle mighty enemies.

447
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:47,677
Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is a game where everyone can be the hero,

448
00:50:47,837 --> 00:50:50,319
whether they be dads, moms, kids, or friends.

449
00:50:53,172 --> 00:50:58,477
Hoshino Kirby Wii Deluxe is packed full of the creative ingenuity of 2D Kirby games,

450
00:50:58,737 --> 00:51:00,399
cultivated through 30 years of history.

451
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:05,504
Kirby's Return to Dream Land Deluxe is packed full of the creative ingenuity of 2D Kirby

452
00:51:05,524 --> 00:51:08,107
games, cultivated through 30 years of history.

453
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:24,224
And in Kirby's Forgotten Land, we challenged ourselves to create a uniquely Kirby 3D action game, approachable to all.

454
00:51:39,041 --> 00:51:44,083
Whether 2D or 3D, everything from the technology and worldview to the design

455
00:51:44,483 --> 00:51:47,904
was thought out with the goal of making each gaming experience awesome.

456
00:51:47,924 --> 00:51:52,706
If I were to describe Kirby games in a single phrase, it would be one you've heard already.

457
00:51:53,707 --> 00:51:54,327
Approachable yet deep.

458
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:57,928
And it's the concept we've kept front and center as we've continued to create Kirby games.

459
00:51:58,489 --> 00:52:02,390
If I were to describe Kirby games in a single phrase, it would be one you've heard already.

460
00:52:02,830 --> 00:52:03,971
Approachable yet deep.

461
00:52:04,611 --> 00:52:08,633
And it's the concept we've kept front and center as we've continued to create Kirby games.

462
00:52:12,202 --> 00:52:13,944
This is my 22nd year in Kirby development.

463
00:52:13,984 --> 00:52:19,950
It has grown so much that it is still a series that has been played all over the world for over 30 years.

464
00:52:20,591 --> 00:52:22,513
I am very impressed.

465
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:34,178
This year marks the 22nd year since my first involvement in Kirby development.

466
00:52:34,978 --> 00:52:39,462
The series has continued to expand, and somehow it has become a series played around the world

467
00:52:39,762 --> 00:52:41,043
with 30 years of history.

468
00:52:41,463 --> 00:52:43,204
I cannot express how much that means to me.

469
00:52:57,452 --> 00:53:01,796
Once again, I would like to express my gratitude to the developers who gave birth to this series

470
00:53:01,876 --> 00:53:05,539
and continue to develop it, and to everybody who has ever played a Kirby game.

471
00:53:07,321 --> 00:53:12,085
And I would be overjoyed if any of what we have shared today

472
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,766
helps you, the developers, in any small way.

473
00:53:23,193 --> 00:53:26,774
We will, along with our team, continue to challenge ourselves to create games that are even more

474
00:53:26,794 --> 00:53:29,175
approachable yet deep, no matter what genre they are.

475
00:53:29,195 --> 00:53:30,475
Thank you so much for your time today!
