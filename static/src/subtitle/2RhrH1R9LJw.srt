1
00:00:05,067 --> 00:00:07,490
Am I on? Hello, right, I'll get started.

2
00:00:08,511 --> 00:00:11,575
My name is Ian and I am an accessibility specialist.

3
00:00:11,655 --> 00:00:15,400
So I work with various areas of the industry to try and raise awareness

4
00:00:15,460 --> 00:00:19,125
and raise the bar for inclusion of people with disabilities in game development.

5
00:00:21,574 --> 00:00:25,137
So for me, at the moment, it's a very exciting time in the

6
00:00:25,177 --> 00:00:26,038
development of the industry.

7
00:00:26,819 --> 00:00:29,742
Every year, the pace of change accelerates.

8
00:00:30,122 --> 00:00:32,084
More and more really nice stuff happens in the field of

9
00:00:32,144 --> 00:00:32,685
accessibility.

10
00:00:32,705 --> 00:00:35,067
That's why I'm going to share with you today a few of the

11
00:00:35,087 --> 00:00:36,369
interesting things that have been happening.

12
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:40,393
And doing this talk actually puts me in an interesting

13
00:00:40,473 --> 00:00:40,813
position.

14
00:00:42,394 --> 00:00:45,055
Because this time last year, I did a similar kind of talk

15
00:00:45,595 --> 00:00:47,916
about the highlights of what happened in 2015.

16
00:00:48,016 --> 00:00:50,917
And it was a pretty simple process.

17
00:00:51,478 --> 00:00:52,238
I looked at what happened.

18
00:00:52,438 --> 00:00:53,218
I put it into a talk.

19
00:00:53,318 --> 00:00:53,638
I gave it.

20
00:00:54,018 --> 00:00:56,259
This year, I can't do that, because there's way too much

21
00:00:56,299 --> 00:00:58,840
to physically be able to fit into a presentation, which is

22
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:00,121
a pretty nice situation to be in.

23
00:01:00,781 --> 00:01:03,942
So I'm just going to talk about four kind of common

24
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,703
themes that have been in the development of the industry

25
00:01:06,743 --> 00:01:07,003
this year.

26
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,154
But first of all, because I'm sure there'll be a range of levels of expertise and knowledge

27
00:01:14,234 --> 00:01:19,139
about accessibility, I'm just going to assume nothing and start from the start with an explanation

28
00:01:19,159 --> 00:01:22,442
about what accessibility is and why it's important.

29
00:01:24,303 --> 00:01:28,107
And as I said, when I talk about accessibility, I'm talking about relating to disability.

30
00:01:28,407 --> 00:01:29,988
So sorry?

31
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:32,671
Someone say something?

32
00:01:33,832 --> 00:01:34,152
I assume not.

33
00:01:35,145 --> 00:01:42,268
Cool, okay, right. So I'm going to start with an explanation about what disability is, and for that I have this gentleman here to help me.

34
00:01:44,648 --> 00:01:50,470
Now this image was taken as part of an investigation that he was doing for a newspaper back in the UK.

35
00:01:51,991 --> 00:01:59,773
And I'm sure when looking at this picture, most of the people in this room would be able to have some kind of a guess at what this guy's disability is.

36
00:02:00,314 --> 00:02:01,654
What it is that's making him disabled.

37
00:02:04,862 --> 00:02:08,205
So you might be thinking that perhaps he has cerebral palsy.

38
00:02:09,786 --> 00:02:11,047
In which case, you're kind of halfway there.

39
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,489
He does have cerebral palsy, but cerebral palsy is not

40
00:02:14,609 --> 00:02:15,870
actually a disability.

41
00:02:16,831 --> 00:02:17,771
It's a medical condition.

42
00:02:18,392 --> 00:02:20,453
And that's a really important distinction to make.

43
00:02:23,015 --> 00:02:23,976
So what else could it be then?

44
00:02:24,356 --> 00:02:26,938
You might also be thinking about the fact that he is in a

45
00:02:27,198 --> 00:02:27,598
wheelchair.

46
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,441
But again, a wheelchair is not a disability.

47
00:02:33,201 --> 00:02:34,762
It's like a pair of glasses.

48
00:02:35,362 --> 00:02:38,403
It's a piece of assistive technology that actually helps

49
00:02:38,463 --> 00:02:39,443
him go about his day.

50
00:02:41,724 --> 00:02:45,886
And he was going about his day fine until he went to meet his

51
00:02:45,966 --> 00:02:49,287
friends in this bar and encountered the steps.

52
00:02:50,917 --> 00:02:55,100
So in the context of meeting his friends in this bar, he is being disabled by the steps.

53
00:02:56,140 --> 00:03:01,123
And that's what disability actually is. It's when someone's medical condition encounters

54
00:03:01,163 --> 00:03:07,867
some kind of barrier, resulting in difficulty performing a day-to-day task. So it's a mismatch

55
00:03:07,907 --> 00:03:09,508
between a person and their environment.

56
00:03:11,454 --> 00:03:16,136
And the barriers that people face, whether it is steps in front of a bar,

57
00:03:16,956 --> 00:03:18,957
whether it is a shelf that's too high,

58
00:03:19,697 --> 00:03:21,778
whether it is red and green teams in a deathmatch,

59
00:03:23,398 --> 00:03:26,539
these barriers are often put there by another person.

60
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,140
So we're designed to be like that.

61
00:03:31,221 --> 00:03:33,041
Which is kind of a heavy thing to get your head around,

62
00:03:33,061 --> 00:03:35,702
that as designers, as developers, as content producers,

63
00:03:36,183 --> 00:03:38,763
we are actually contributing to people's disability.

64
00:03:40,574 --> 00:03:44,477
But there is also the flip side to that, which is by being aware of the kind of barriers

65
00:03:44,518 --> 00:03:49,662
that people can encounter, we can figure out which of those barriers are unnecessary and

66
00:03:49,702 --> 00:03:54,346
avoid them and remove them and prevent disabling situations like these from occurring.

67
00:03:55,587 --> 00:03:57,869
And it's that process that's known as accessibility.

68
00:04:00,249 --> 00:04:03,052
Accessibility is important. It's important for many, many reasons.

69
00:04:03,352 --> 00:04:07,055
But one of those reasons is that people with disabilities are a market.

70
00:04:08,116 --> 00:04:09,638
And not an insignificant market either.

71
00:04:10,258 --> 00:04:13,842
The latest US government data is 22% of the adult population of the USA.

72
00:04:16,584 --> 00:04:19,965
Now, not everyone in that 22% is going to encounter barriers with games.

73
00:04:20,885 --> 00:04:24,946
That's more than balanced out by the other conditions that aren't included in that 22%.

74
00:04:25,406 --> 00:04:29,247
There's also color blindness, which affects 8% of males.

75
00:04:30,747 --> 00:04:34,388
Simulation sickness, estimates of that range anything from 10% upwards.

76
00:04:35,528 --> 00:04:40,470
Difficulty reading, now this is the one that surprises people because you don't hear about it because there's such a stigma.

77
00:04:41,050 --> 00:04:42,630
Difficulty reading affects 14% of adults.

78
00:04:46,261 --> 00:04:47,961
And this is just talking about permanent conditions.

79
00:04:48,001 --> 00:04:50,122
There's also temporary impairments,

80
00:04:50,942 --> 00:04:53,103
like having a broken arm, like RSI.

81
00:04:54,023 --> 00:04:55,743
There's also situational impairments,

82
00:04:56,364 --> 00:04:57,764
like having to play a game on mute

83
00:04:57,964 --> 00:05:00,545
because the baby's asleep, playing in direct sunlight.

84
00:05:00,565 --> 00:05:02,945
So there's all kinds of situations

85
00:05:02,965 --> 00:05:04,506
where these kind of barriers occur.

86
00:05:05,626 --> 00:05:06,746
Large, large numbers of people.

87
00:05:07,086 --> 00:05:08,106
And also these large numbers

88
00:05:08,547 --> 00:05:10,027
equate into large amounts of business,

89
00:05:10,407 --> 00:05:12,027
money to be made, money to be lost

90
00:05:12,328 --> 00:05:13,288
through these kind of decisions.

91
00:05:16,009 --> 00:05:19,660
And the other really, really important reason for considering accessibility is something

92
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:20,824
that's a bit less mercenary.

93
00:05:21,125 --> 00:05:23,091
It's the human benefit of accessibility.

94
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:31,923
Because what games actually represent is access to recreation, to culture, to socializing,

95
00:05:33,164 --> 00:05:35,866
which are things that so many of us just take for granted.

96
00:05:36,987 --> 00:05:42,910
But if for any reason in your day-to-day life your means of accessing those things is restricted,

97
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:49,554
games can then provide them and become a really important contributor to someone's quality

98
00:05:49,574 --> 00:05:49,855
of life.

99
00:05:53,217 --> 00:05:56,419
Or, to explain all of that in a much more concise way than I have,

100
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:59,101
it's one of my favorite quotes.

101
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:08,387
So because accessibility is so important, it's been really, really nice to see

102
00:06:09,007 --> 00:06:11,949
the field advancing, more and more progress being made every year,

103
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:15,392
increasing exponentially every year.

104
00:06:15,412 --> 00:06:17,233
You see more and more and more, faster and faster,

105
00:06:17,273 --> 00:06:18,474
and the last year is no exception.

106
00:06:19,694 --> 00:06:20,875
But going back a little bit further,

107
00:06:22,814 --> 00:06:29,479
The big advance of 2015 was the introduction of accessibility functionality on consoles,

108
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:35,784
on both the PlayStation 4 and the Xbox One. And this includes stuff like text-to-speech

109
00:06:36,464 --> 00:06:41,068
so that people who are blind can navigate the system interface, high contrast mode,

110
00:06:41,789 --> 00:06:45,612
zoom, remapping the controls at system level. All this stuff was added in.

111
00:06:46,912 --> 00:06:48,293
And that's continued on into 2016.

112
00:06:48,353 --> 00:06:51,034
So neither company has been resting on their laurels.

113
00:06:51,054 --> 00:06:55,597
They've continued to add in more functionality, like control over text speed, improved text

114
00:06:55,617 --> 00:06:56,197
size options.

115
00:06:57,117 --> 00:06:58,278
This is another nice example.

116
00:06:58,318 --> 00:07:01,359
This is the addition of clubs onto Xbox One.

117
00:07:02,040 --> 00:07:06,062
And you can see here it's being used by deaf gamers to find other people to play with who

118
00:07:06,142 --> 00:07:08,563
aren't going to kick them out of a game because they can't use a microphone.

119
00:07:12,935 --> 00:07:14,476
And it hasn't just been the consoles either.

120
00:07:14,516 --> 00:07:16,257
It's now starting to spread further.

121
00:07:16,838 --> 00:07:20,180
So this is Steam Big Picture mode, which now allows, again,

122
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,500
full button remapping.

123
00:07:25,322 --> 00:07:28,444
And also Steam have open sourced their Lighthouse

124
00:07:28,484 --> 00:07:32,206
technology, which opens the door to custom

125
00:07:32,547 --> 00:07:33,467
input devices for VR.

126
00:07:35,238 --> 00:07:38,499
But this button remapping stuff, remapping at platform

127
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:42,200
level, both in Steam and on the consoles, is really good

128
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,502
as a safety net, but it's not as good as remapping in a game.

129
00:07:46,402 --> 00:07:48,843
If you have actual in-game remapping, that opens up

130
00:07:48,883 --> 00:07:51,944
things like being able to have separate maps for walking and

131
00:07:51,984 --> 00:07:54,785
for driving, or like in Overwatch, being able to have

132
00:07:54,845 --> 00:07:56,385
separate mappings for each character class.

133
00:07:56,966 --> 00:07:59,607
It also allows you to do things like have your in-game

134
00:07:59,627 --> 00:08:02,528
tutorials and prompts update to reflect what the current

135
00:08:02,568 --> 00:08:02,888
mapping is.

136
00:08:04,985 --> 00:08:06,729
But there is a barrier to that, which is the cost of

137
00:08:06,749 --> 00:08:11,340
implementing it, which is in the process

138
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:12,101
of being broken down.

139
00:08:15,312 --> 00:08:18,533
So I think it was around April 2016, Unity announced that

140
00:08:18,574 --> 00:08:21,735
they were working on a new input model, which it hasn't

141
00:08:22,156 --> 00:08:24,297
hit general public release yet, but they're developing it

142
00:08:24,357 --> 00:08:25,558
collaboratively with developers.

143
00:08:25,698 --> 00:08:27,519
So you can actually already go on the site and download it

144
00:08:27,559 --> 00:08:28,439
and have a play around with it.

145
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:34,062
And the basic principle is it just abstracts out inputs and

146
00:08:34,162 --> 00:08:35,823
actions by default.

147
00:08:37,847 --> 00:08:40,531
So an input being, for example, the A button, an action

148
00:08:40,571 --> 00:08:41,072
being jump.

149
00:08:41,813 --> 00:08:42,394
They're separate.

150
00:08:42,634 --> 00:08:44,657
And to create a control scheme, a developer just

151
00:08:44,737 --> 00:08:47,020
creates relationships, creates links between those things,

152
00:08:47,581 --> 00:08:49,824
which means the functionality is already there for players

153
00:08:49,884 --> 00:08:50,565
to do the same thing.

154
00:08:52,027 --> 00:08:57,652
And basically because Unity wants to support input devices that haven't even been invented yet,

155
00:08:58,252 --> 00:09:01,334
you know, the pace at which things are being invented for VR and stuff like that,

156
00:09:02,735 --> 00:09:05,677
they wanted to make sure that all different types of input work together,

157
00:09:06,498 --> 00:09:08,640
which means that it can do things like, for example,

158
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:12,322
remap a controller-based control scheme to a keyboard or a mouse.

159
00:09:12,883 --> 00:09:14,564
You can remap analog to digital,

160
00:09:14,944 --> 00:09:18,587
so you can move a command between, like, the B button and pushing forward on an analog stick.

161
00:09:19,027 --> 00:09:21,089
So this is all quite difficult stuff for developers to do,

162
00:09:21,109 --> 00:09:23,331
and it's all just going to be handled for you at engine level.

163
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,318
And there's also been some nice platform-level advances

164
00:09:31,458 --> 00:09:33,019
outside the dedicated gaming space.

165
00:09:35,121 --> 00:09:37,764
So what you're looking at here is an iPad on the right.

166
00:09:38,824 --> 00:09:41,947
And the iPad is being operated solely by the yellow button.

167
00:09:44,152 --> 00:09:46,474
And that yellow button is something that's known as an

168
00:09:46,634 --> 00:09:47,614
accessibility switch.

169
00:09:48,455 --> 00:09:51,397
And it's called a switch because it's a simple on-off

170
00:09:51,957 --> 00:09:52,458
interaction.

171
00:09:53,818 --> 00:09:56,300
And those kind of input devices, they can take lots of

172
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:56,900
different forms.

173
00:09:57,000 --> 00:09:57,881
It could be a button like that.

174
00:09:58,541 --> 00:10:00,082
A common setup is a button mounted on a

175
00:10:00,122 --> 00:10:00,923
wheelchair headrest.

176
00:10:01,723 --> 00:10:03,184
It could be a tube you blow into.

177
00:10:05,046 --> 00:10:06,486
It could be an infrared link detector.

178
00:10:06,687 --> 00:10:08,868
It's the same kind of kit that Stephen Hawking uses to

179
00:10:08,908 --> 00:10:09,568
operate technology.

180
00:10:12,119 --> 00:10:16,383
And iOS is compatible with this, like at an operating system level.

181
00:10:16,403 --> 00:10:19,105
You can operate the whole of an iPhone, of an iPad,

182
00:10:19,165 --> 00:10:20,986
just using a single input.

183
00:10:22,347 --> 00:10:23,488
And it has a couple of different modes.

184
00:10:23,668 --> 00:10:27,311
One of them is basically it works like shooting in a basketball game.

185
00:10:27,952 --> 00:10:30,754
So you have a line that moves across the screen.

186
00:10:33,461 --> 00:10:34,141
Sorry, wrong one.

187
00:10:35,142 --> 00:10:36,503
So you have a line that moves left and right

188
00:10:36,523 --> 00:10:37,124
across the screen.

189
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,706
When it reaches the coordinate you want, you make your input,

190
00:10:41,006 --> 00:10:41,407
it stops.

191
00:10:42,367 --> 00:10:43,888
Then the line moves up and down.

192
00:10:43,908 --> 00:10:45,490
You choose the coordinate you want.

193
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:48,452
Once you've chosen the coordinate on the screen, it

194
00:10:48,512 --> 00:10:50,973
pops up a little menu and asks you what you would like to do

195
00:10:51,294 --> 00:10:53,375
at that point, whether you want to tap, whether you want to

196
00:10:53,415 --> 00:10:54,416
swipe, whether you want to zoom.

197
00:10:56,853 --> 00:10:59,957
Which already makes a lot of games accessible.

198
00:11:00,838 --> 00:11:04,542
So you can imagine a basic interface type game like Football Manager, something like that.

199
00:11:04,763 --> 00:11:06,185
You can operate using this technology.

200
00:11:06,625 --> 00:11:10,069
So like this guy's doing, Christopher, he's using a single button on his wheelchair headrest.

201
00:11:12,352 --> 00:11:15,416
Not so good if you're playing something like Flappy Birds, for example.

202
00:11:16,357 --> 00:11:18,880
So Flappy Birds, in theory, is just a single input.

203
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:20,462
It should work with this kind of technology.

204
00:11:21,283 --> 00:11:23,725
But using the scanning from side to side system, you can

205
00:11:23,745 --> 00:11:27,750
imagine you move across, move down, hit the Start button,

206
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:30,713
start moving across, and that's happened.

207
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,479
That has now changed.

208
00:11:36,619 --> 00:11:38,281
This has been really, really exciting to see.

209
00:11:38,301 --> 00:11:41,623
In the past year, Apple, in response to requests, has

210
00:11:41,683 --> 00:11:44,625
actually done two specific updates to this functionality

211
00:11:45,185 --> 00:11:46,026
specific to games.

212
00:11:47,407 --> 00:11:51,890
So the first one being in iOS 9, they added the ability to

213
00:11:52,030 --> 00:11:54,552
choose a point on the screen and then tap repeatedly at

214
00:11:54,592 --> 00:11:57,234
that point, which means that games like Canabalt, games

215
00:11:57,254 --> 00:11:59,976
like Flappy Birds, now just work with that kind of

216
00:11:59,996 --> 00:12:00,396
technology.

217
00:12:01,974 --> 00:12:07,918
iOS 10, they upgraded it again, allowing you to hold down at a point repeatedly, which

218
00:12:07,938 --> 00:12:12,942
means games like Alto's Adventure, games like Badlands, just work with this kind of technology,

219
00:12:13,923 --> 00:12:18,907
which is a really, really amazing example of the power of operating systems to facilitate

220
00:12:18,927 --> 00:12:19,467
this kind of stuff.

221
00:12:19,487 --> 00:12:25,152
Because it just means thousands of games overnight now just work with this kind of technology

222
00:12:25,592 --> 00:12:27,213
without any effort from developers at all.

223
00:12:35,323 --> 00:12:37,323
There's also been advances in games themselves.

224
00:12:40,744 --> 00:12:42,584
Now, in the games media this year, there's been two things

225
00:12:42,644 --> 00:12:43,985
above all else that have really, really

226
00:12:44,045 --> 00:12:45,005
dominated the media.

227
00:12:45,505 --> 00:12:47,085
The first one being Pokemon Go.

228
00:12:48,666 --> 00:12:51,106
And Pokemon Go is actually accessible with this kind of

229
00:12:51,126 --> 00:12:52,446
switch technology that I'm talking about.

230
00:12:52,947 --> 00:12:54,827
So what you can see on the screen here is after you've

231
00:12:54,847 --> 00:12:57,147
chosen a coordinate, it gives you the little menu, the

232
00:12:57,187 --> 00:12:58,428
palette of actions you can choose.

233
00:12:58,928 --> 00:13:01,508
So you can see here it's choosing a flick to flick the

234
00:13:01,528 --> 00:13:01,848
Pokeball.

235
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:08,236
But despite this, Pokemon in general is not a very accessible game.

236
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:12,797
Now, some of that is due to the physicality of the game,

237
00:13:13,217 --> 00:13:15,578
the fact that you have to be climbing up hills and stuff

238
00:13:15,598 --> 00:13:15,898
to play it.

239
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:19,600
But a lot of it is actually just due to simple interface

240
00:13:19,640 --> 00:13:23,221
decisions, so things like these complex gestures, that

241
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:26,522
has small, low-contrast text, which is obviously not great

242
00:13:26,562 --> 00:13:28,223
for a game that you're supposed to play outdoors in

243
00:13:28,243 --> 00:13:28,683
the sunlight.

244
00:13:29,724 --> 00:13:32,305
Also, the map screen, the elements in the map screen

245
00:13:32,405 --> 00:13:34,726
that are distinguished by color alone, not so great if

246
00:13:34,746 --> 00:13:35,186
you're colorblind.

247
00:13:36,987 --> 00:13:38,311
So this obviously isn't an advance.

248
00:13:38,391 --> 00:13:40,096
It certainly doesn't make Pokemon Go unique.

249
00:13:41,399 --> 00:13:44,749
What does make Pokemon Go unique is stuff like this.

250
00:13:46,717 --> 00:13:49,918
A huge, huge amount of discussion that there's been about it.

251
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:56,001
So blog posts, social media, even like mainstream media articles about it.

252
00:13:57,422 --> 00:14:00,003
From gamers, from developers, from advocacy groups,

253
00:14:00,424 --> 00:14:02,264
people like American Foundation for the Blind,

254
00:14:02,485 --> 00:14:04,265
groups that are not normally involved in gaming

255
00:14:04,305 --> 00:14:07,967
who are now talking about the accessibility potentials of Pokemon Go.

256
00:14:08,408 --> 00:14:11,289
Lots of people with loads of really good ideas about how to improve the accessibility.

257
00:14:13,238 --> 00:14:14,699
And this is important for a couple of reasons.

258
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,881
Firstly, it's important because it's a rear wheel sign

259
00:14:19,602 --> 00:14:21,463
of the growing awareness of accessibility.

260
00:14:22,264 --> 00:14:24,185
And also people's changing expectations

261
00:14:24,345 --> 00:14:25,426
about accessibility as well.

262
00:14:25,586 --> 00:14:27,247
You know, gamers have got different ideas now

263
00:14:27,307 --> 00:14:28,267
compared to a couple of years ago

264
00:14:28,287 --> 00:14:29,248
about what games should be,

265
00:14:29,528 --> 00:14:30,449
about what games should be doing.

266
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:33,791
And it's also really significant

267
00:14:33,811 --> 00:14:37,693
because it's a big sign of the cultural significance of games.

268
00:14:39,018 --> 00:14:42,259
Because there's a really, really strong undercurrent to all this commentary

269
00:14:42,879 --> 00:14:45,520
of people who, you know, they could see this cultural phenomenon

270
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:48,281
happening around them, and they didn't want to be excluded from it.

271
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,381
They wanted to experience the same thing that all their friends were experiencing.

272
00:14:55,162 --> 00:14:57,603
Now the other thing that's been dominating, obviously, the games press

273
00:14:57,643 --> 00:15:00,444
and also the mainstream press over the last year has been VR.

274
00:15:02,945 --> 00:15:05,525
And VR can be quite an exclusionary platform.

275
00:15:07,646 --> 00:15:09,467
So the requirements to be able to walk around a room,

276
00:15:10,168 --> 00:15:14,150
the requirements to be able to use two hand-controlled motion

277
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:18,473
tracking controllers, even just the simple function

278
00:15:18,493 --> 00:15:21,275
of putting a large, bulky object onto your head,

279
00:15:21,415 --> 00:15:22,856
all these things can be exclusionary.

280
00:15:24,077 --> 00:15:27,419
And some of the barriers that VR throws up

281
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:29,521
are kind of inherent to the platform.

282
00:15:30,061 --> 00:15:31,902
There's not much you can do about them, but a lot of them

283
00:15:32,343 --> 00:15:34,264
can actually be addressed through just good accessible

284
00:15:34,304 --> 00:15:34,564
design.

285
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:43,409
Which people are realizing, there's a lot of developers who are really, really passionate

286
00:15:43,449 --> 00:15:47,512
about accessibility in VR, and they're doing some really, really nice things, really nice

287
00:15:47,572 --> 00:15:49,434
creative approaches to accessibility in VR.

288
00:15:51,332 --> 00:15:53,053
And this is really, really exciting for me to see,

289
00:15:53,113 --> 00:15:55,715
because we haven't had this before with a new platform.

290
00:15:56,435 --> 00:15:58,396
We didn't have this when motion controls came out.

291
00:15:59,237 --> 00:16:00,718
Before that, we didn't have this when

292
00:16:00,798 --> 00:16:01,758
touch controls came out.

293
00:16:02,759 --> 00:16:05,581
So it's really, really exciting to see just this

294
00:16:05,601 --> 00:16:08,262
kind of level of understanding and appreciation of

295
00:16:08,302 --> 00:16:10,224
accessibility at such an early stage of VR.

296
00:16:14,586 --> 00:16:15,967
And we also had to launch a PlayStation VR.

297
00:16:17,603 --> 00:16:19,844
Where the vast majority of launch games

298
00:16:19,904 --> 00:16:21,125
had an option like this.

299
00:16:21,785 --> 00:16:23,886
We have a choice between a standard controller

300
00:16:23,986 --> 00:16:24,787
and motion controllers.

301
00:16:25,407 --> 00:16:26,928
Which is obviously handy if you don't happen

302
00:16:26,948 --> 00:16:27,908
to own move controllers.

303
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:30,409
Also really, really handy if you don't happen

304
00:16:30,449 --> 00:16:33,110
to have a full set of working arms and working fingers.

305
00:16:35,471 --> 00:16:37,853
So hopefully because this is also PlayStation VR,

306
00:16:37,913 --> 00:16:39,373
it's obviously quite a high profile launch,

307
00:16:39,713 --> 00:16:40,774
a lot of high profile games.

308
00:16:41,554 --> 00:16:42,635
Hopefully this will be the kind of thing

309
00:16:42,655 --> 00:16:43,835
that can help set a precedent,

310
00:16:44,235 --> 00:16:45,496
show other developers what's possible.

311
00:16:51,902 --> 00:16:57,184
Another nice source of accessibility in games over the past year in particular has been through game jams.

312
00:16:57,904 --> 00:17:00,025
I was just having a chat with someone just before I came in about this.

313
00:17:02,586 --> 00:17:05,687
Now, I'm sure most of the people in the room are pretty familiar with game jams,

314
00:17:05,787 --> 00:17:10,049
but just in case there are some uninitiated, it's basically like a game-based hackathon event.

315
00:17:10,289 --> 00:17:12,830
You turn up on day one, get given some kind of a challenge,

316
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:15,831
team up, and then have a very, very short amount of time to build a game.

317
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:20,840
And one of the biggest ones is an event

318
00:17:20,860 --> 00:17:21,740
called Global Game Jam.

319
00:17:23,241 --> 00:17:25,682
This is a photo of just one single venue of Global Game

320
00:17:25,702 --> 00:17:25,882
Jam.

321
00:17:25,982 --> 00:17:27,862
There's venues like this all over the world, loads of

322
00:17:27,882 --> 00:17:29,903
different countries, tens of thousands of participants.

323
00:17:34,479 --> 00:17:37,480
And Global Game Jam is an organization that cares a lot about accessibility.

324
00:17:38,621 --> 00:17:44,444
They have a, in addition to the main theme, they also have a set of optional challenges.

325
00:17:44,465 --> 00:17:48,547
You know, for in case building a game in 48 hours wasn't enough of a challenge already.

326
00:17:50,788 --> 00:17:54,090
And every year, a number of those optional challenges are accessibility ones.

327
00:17:55,331 --> 00:17:59,233
So for example, in 2016, they had challenges like make a game that you can play using one

328
00:17:59,273 --> 00:18:02,315
hand, making a game that has high contrast visuals.

329
00:18:04,108 --> 00:18:08,233
And those challenges were taken up in the region of 3,000 times.

330
00:18:10,336 --> 00:18:12,699
Based on the average team sizes in Global Game Jam,

331
00:18:13,260 --> 00:18:15,683
that's something in the region of 10,000 developers

332
00:18:16,004 --> 00:18:17,666
who were experimenting with accessibility

333
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:18,687
over the course of this weekend.

334
00:18:24,814 --> 00:18:26,775
And Global Game Jams don't have a monopoly on this either.

335
00:18:27,176 --> 00:18:29,378
In the past year, there's been more accessibility jams

336
00:18:29,398 --> 00:18:30,499
than there ever has been before.

337
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:34,643
Jams that are either dedicated solely to accessibility,

338
00:18:34,763 --> 00:18:35,503
like this one in Japan,

339
00:18:36,524 --> 00:18:37,986
jams that have an accessibility element,

340
00:18:38,166 --> 00:18:38,987
like Global Game Jam.

341
00:18:39,507 --> 00:18:40,888
There's been, as well as this Japan,

342
00:18:40,948 --> 00:18:42,750
Global Game Jams, there's been ones in Poland,

343
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,512
UK, Canada, global ones.

344
00:18:45,873 --> 00:18:47,074
And it's really, really nice to see

345
00:18:47,134 --> 00:18:49,997
because game jams are such a powerful tool

346
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,138
for raising awareness.

347
00:18:53,565 --> 00:18:56,467
Because there's a really common misconception that

348
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,369
accessibility is going to be difficult.

349
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:00,409
It's going to be hard.

350
00:19:00,849 --> 00:19:01,770
It's going to be expensive.

351
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:05,852
But if developers can come to an event like this and see

352
00:19:05,872 --> 00:19:08,534
that actually, even in the context of building a game in

353
00:19:09,074 --> 00:19:11,656
48 hours, you can make a real difference, that's a really,

354
00:19:11,676 --> 00:19:14,057
really powerful lesson that people can take back to their

355
00:19:14,077 --> 00:19:14,417
day jobs.

356
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:21,781
We've also seen some nice progress on

357
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:23,062
individual features.

358
00:19:24,618 --> 00:19:25,619
One of these is subtitling.

359
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,000
Subtitling is really, really important for lots of reasons.

360
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,941
I mean, the obvious one being if you're deaf.

361
00:19:32,781 --> 00:19:35,222
It's also important if, like I said earlier,

362
00:19:35,602 --> 00:19:37,643
if you have to play on mute because the baby's asleep.

363
00:19:39,063 --> 00:19:41,504
It's also important if you're playing in a noisy room.

364
00:19:42,584 --> 00:19:45,445
People have it turned on because audio mixes and games

365
00:19:45,565 --> 00:19:46,265
are unpredictable.

366
00:19:46,445 --> 00:19:48,406
There might be an explosion going off, just

367
00:19:48,426 --> 00:19:49,786
an important bit of exposition.

368
00:19:50,967 --> 00:19:52,247
So because of all these reasons, it's

369
00:19:52,287 --> 00:19:54,008
not really surprising to see data like this.

370
00:19:56,233 --> 00:19:59,314
Now I have to give a little bit of a disclaimer because this isn't a scientific study, this

371
00:19:59,354 --> 00:20:02,576
is a straw poll on a website, but still, it starts to tell a bit of a story.

372
00:20:04,397 --> 00:20:10,199
So because subtitles are so important for so many people, they're obviously worth doing

373
00:20:10,419 --> 00:20:10,940
a good job of.

374
00:20:13,181 --> 00:20:13,801
But nobody does.

375
00:20:15,162 --> 00:20:19,304
Subtitles in games are terrible, and I do mean in all of your games.

376
00:20:20,664 --> 00:20:21,585
And this isn't coming from me.

377
00:20:26,395 --> 00:20:29,208
So this is just coming from a single thread on NeoGAF.

378
00:20:35,592 --> 00:20:36,592
So you can get the gist right.

379
00:20:37,572 --> 00:20:39,693
So in general, gamers are really not happy about the state of

380
00:20:39,733 --> 00:20:40,554
subtitles in games.

381
00:20:40,894 --> 00:20:42,334
And it's really, really simple things.

382
00:20:42,375 --> 00:20:44,295
You can see a lot of things people are talking about here

383
00:20:44,315 --> 00:20:46,356
are just the subtitles are too small.

384
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:48,057
I can't see them against the background.

385
00:20:48,337 --> 00:20:49,918
This really isn't rocket science to solve.

386
00:20:50,898 --> 00:20:52,979
And it's also problems that have already been solved by

387
00:20:53,019 --> 00:20:55,340
other industries, like TV, film.

388
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,001
They've been looking at this stuff for 50 years.

389
00:20:57,041 --> 00:20:57,761
They've figured it out.

390
00:20:57,861 --> 00:20:59,502
You can just copy the lessons they've already learned.

391
00:21:00,842 --> 00:21:03,123
And games finally are starting to do that.

392
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:08,260
So a few examples.

393
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:11,062
This is from a game called Virginia, which doesn't

394
00:21:11,122 --> 00:21:14,424
actually have any dialogue in it at all, but it still has

395
00:21:14,464 --> 00:21:16,466
captions for important background sounds.

396
00:21:21,209 --> 00:21:22,110
The latest Tomb Raider game.

397
00:21:22,971 --> 00:21:27,674
So you can see here, it's using color to distinguish

398
00:21:27,694 --> 00:21:28,254
who's speaking.

399
00:21:28,535 --> 00:21:31,317
It's also using name tags to distinguish who is speaking.

400
00:21:31,937 --> 00:21:34,119
It's also using letterboxing, which is the name for that

401
00:21:34,179 --> 00:21:36,060
rectangle behind the text to increase the contrast.

402
00:21:37,823 --> 00:21:39,044
There are games that have done this before.

403
00:21:39,204 --> 00:21:42,106
But what makes Tomb Raider unique is that it's optional.

404
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:45,267
So there are some people who really, really rely on this

405
00:21:45,307 --> 00:21:45,747
kind of stuff.

406
00:21:46,207 --> 00:21:47,488
Other people who find it distracting.

407
00:21:48,569 --> 00:21:49,389
Just give them the option.

408
00:21:49,509 --> 00:21:50,129
Turn it on and off.

409
00:21:55,252 --> 00:21:59,254
We've also started to see games giving this option, the

410
00:21:59,314 --> 00:22:01,235
option to configure the size of the subtitles.

411
00:22:03,032 --> 00:22:05,893
And again, this comes down to the different kind of use cases for subtitles.

412
00:22:06,193 --> 00:22:10,395
Because you know, some people, if someone's deaf and needs to understand every single word that's in the subtitles,

413
00:22:10,755 --> 00:22:12,616
they need it to be as clear as possible.

414
00:22:14,057 --> 00:22:18,099
Somebody else, like the person I mentioned who just glances at them occasionally when an explosion goes off,

415
00:22:18,619 --> 00:22:19,960
they want them to be subtle.

416
00:22:20,900 --> 00:22:22,201
So again, just give people the choice.

417
00:22:28,004 --> 00:22:31,485
Someone else who's done this recently, this is the latest Hitman game.

418
00:22:33,314 --> 00:22:36,896
Two nice things here. First of all, it's giving you a preview of what the subtitle is going to look like.

419
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:45,120
Secondly, subtitle size 46, which is an important number. So that's 46 pixels at 1080p.

420
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:47,421
That's the size that your subtitle should be.

421
00:22:49,402 --> 00:22:52,403
If you only have one size for your subtitles, make them at least 46 pixels.

422
00:22:53,324 --> 00:22:57,786
If you don't want them to be that by default, at least provide an option for people to be able to change them up to that size.

423
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,395
Last example, this is from Life is Strange.

424
00:23:04,815 --> 00:23:06,876
So you can see they also have a size option on here.

425
00:23:07,977 --> 00:23:11,159
Underneath, they have an option for the letterboxing, that

426
00:23:11,199 --> 00:23:12,319
black rectangle behind it.

427
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:13,500
You can turn it on and off.

428
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:14,721
You can change the opacity.

429
00:23:16,942 --> 00:23:19,623
What you're also looking at is a list of all the games that

430
00:23:19,643 --> 00:23:20,544
have ever implemented this.

431
00:23:22,384 --> 00:23:24,406
So this is standard functionality on other platforms.

432
00:23:24,426 --> 00:23:26,007
You look at YouTube, you look at Netflix,

433
00:23:26,047 --> 00:23:27,027
they've got these kind of options.

434
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,228
This is the only game to have done it,

435
00:23:28,629 --> 00:23:29,749
and it's such a simple thing to do.

436
00:23:30,750 --> 00:23:32,531
So if you want to really be at the pinnacle

437
00:23:32,792 --> 00:23:34,173
of innovation in the games industry,

438
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:36,394
let people turn that black box on and off.

439
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:37,915
You make a lot of people happy.

440
00:23:40,797 --> 00:23:41,938
So this is just kind of the start.

441
00:23:41,998 --> 00:23:43,679
As I mentioned, there's all kinds of other things

442
00:23:43,699 --> 00:23:44,800
you can do, lessons you can learn

443
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:46,621
from these other platforms, these other industries.

444
00:23:48,963 --> 00:23:50,104
So if you take a note of this link here,

445
00:23:50,264 --> 00:23:52,045
this tells you all these kind of things you can do.

446
00:24:01,467 --> 00:24:03,488
So onto another feature that we've seen a lot of progress in

447
00:24:04,268 --> 00:24:05,109
is color blindness.

448
00:24:05,229 --> 00:24:07,451
That's continuing its march on towards being a standard

449
00:24:07,471 --> 00:24:08,091
consideration.

450
00:24:08,771 --> 00:24:10,433
In the past year, there's been a lot of progress in the

451
00:24:10,493 --> 00:24:13,414
number of games considering it, also progress in the type

452
00:24:13,435 --> 00:24:14,475
of games that are considering it.

453
00:24:16,036 --> 00:24:19,058
So this is a game called Hue, which is a color-based

454
00:24:19,719 --> 00:24:20,459
platform puzzler.

455
00:24:20,479 --> 00:24:23,621
So you can see there's a ring around the character.

456
00:24:23,861 --> 00:24:26,323
When you choose a color from that ring, it changes the

457
00:24:26,363 --> 00:24:27,224
background to that color.

458
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,045
So if you use a cheese purple.

459
00:24:31,133 --> 00:24:32,334
The background will change to purple.

460
00:24:33,735 --> 00:24:35,656
Those purple blocks will no longer be visible against the

461
00:24:35,676 --> 00:24:36,957
backgrounds, and you can walk past them.

462
00:24:37,357 --> 00:24:38,538
So entirely color-based game.

463
00:24:38,858 --> 00:24:41,320
This is the kind of game that a year or two ago would have

464
00:24:41,340 --> 00:24:43,462
been written off as being fundamentally about color.

465
00:24:43,762 --> 00:24:45,523
How can someone who's colorblind possibly play that?

466
00:24:46,404 --> 00:24:47,104
They've added symbols.

467
00:24:48,505 --> 00:24:51,448
Really simple, elegant solution, and it works for all

468
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:52,648
the different types of colorblindness.

469
00:24:52,869 --> 00:24:54,450
And they've had really, really good reception from the

470
00:24:54,470 --> 00:24:55,090
community for it.

471
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:59,338
The next game I'm going to show you is a similar kind of thing.

472
00:24:59,358 --> 00:25:02,001
It's a similar color-based puzzle game.

473
00:25:02,081 --> 00:25:03,222
This one's a first-person one.

474
00:25:03,923 --> 00:25:05,264
But it's based on color mixing.

475
00:25:06,625 --> 00:25:09,488
So in the next game, if you wanted to choose orange like

476
00:25:09,508 --> 00:25:12,911
this, you would actually have to choose yellow and red and

477
00:25:12,951 --> 00:25:13,631
mix them together.

478
00:25:14,692 --> 00:25:16,454
Again, this is the kind of thing that a couple years ago

479
00:25:16,474 --> 00:25:17,775
would have been written off as impossible.

480
00:25:18,015 --> 00:25:19,377
It's inherently color-based, right?

481
00:25:25,575 --> 00:25:26,255
So they've just done this.

482
00:25:27,596 --> 00:25:29,618
So again, this is a similar kind of solution to what was

483
00:25:29,798 --> 00:25:30,438
used in Hue.

484
00:25:30,458 --> 00:25:31,799
They're just using symbols.

485
00:25:32,359 --> 00:25:34,301
So if you want to make something orange, you just

486
00:25:34,321 --> 00:25:37,343
combine the symbols for yellow and the symbols for red.

487
00:25:37,363 --> 00:25:38,764
And that gives you orange.

488
00:25:39,524 --> 00:25:40,645
Really nice, elegant solution.

489
00:25:40,685 --> 00:25:42,286
And again, something that's gone down really, really well

490
00:25:42,306 --> 00:25:42,847
with the community.

491
00:25:47,235 --> 00:25:49,918
As well as these features, there's been all kinds of nice

492
00:25:49,958 --> 00:25:51,881
examples of individual games doing other nice things.

493
00:25:52,401 --> 00:25:54,244
Way too many to be able to go through today, but I'll just

494
00:25:54,264 --> 00:25:55,485
give you a few quick examples.

495
00:25:57,748 --> 00:26:01,232
This one is Madden 17, which has a whole suite of options

496
00:26:01,312 --> 00:26:02,634
for impaired vision.

497
00:26:02,654 --> 00:26:04,857
And there's actually a talk about this on tomorrow

498
00:26:04,897 --> 00:26:06,479
afternoon if you want to find out more about this.

499
00:26:09,315 --> 00:26:11,316
This is Warlock of Firetop Mountain.

500
00:26:11,836 --> 00:26:13,938
And this has a lot of options for

501
00:26:13,978 --> 00:26:15,078
configuring the typography.

502
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:18,800
And this is designed specifically for that 14% of

503
00:26:18,820 --> 00:26:22,102
people who have difficulty reading, which is so rarely

504
00:26:22,142 --> 00:26:24,004
considered and a lot of really quick, easy

505
00:26:24,044 --> 00:26:24,704
fixes you can do.

506
00:26:28,471 --> 00:26:28,871
Overwatch.

507
00:26:29,952 --> 00:26:31,434
Now, Overwatch is a bit of a mixed bag.

508
00:26:31,474 --> 00:26:34,717
There's some things Overwatch doesn't do so well, but some things it does really, really

509
00:26:34,757 --> 00:26:34,917
well.

510
00:26:35,818 --> 00:26:36,498
And this is one of them.

511
00:26:37,639 --> 00:26:42,023
So this is what I was talking about earlier with being able to remap all the individual

512
00:26:42,044 --> 00:26:43,145
classes individually.

513
00:26:44,185 --> 00:26:45,507
That makes this kind of stuff possible.

514
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:46,608
It makes a real difference.

515
00:26:51,904 --> 00:26:54,707
And this is the really, really important example of a game for the last year.

516
00:26:55,528 --> 00:26:58,411
So you might have seen some in the press about this. This is Uncharted 4.

517
00:26:59,512 --> 00:27:04,737
Uncharted 4 has put in some effort into accessibility for motor impairment.

518
00:27:05,618 --> 00:27:07,820
So it has features to allow you to play one-handed.

519
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:09,722
It moves the camera around automatically for you.

520
00:27:09,742 --> 00:27:13,726
It has functionality like Grand Theft Auto to automatically lock on your own.

521
00:27:14,767 --> 00:27:17,491
It has an option here, the one that's highlighted for repeated button presses.

522
00:27:18,232 --> 00:27:21,798
So if you can't physically mash the buttons, you can just hold it down instead.

523
00:27:23,599 --> 00:27:24,719
These options are really popular.

524
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:26,921
This is something you quite often find in accessibility,

525
00:27:26,961 --> 00:27:29,083
is because what you're doing is just removing a barrier,

526
00:27:30,104 --> 00:27:31,685
you aren't addressing a small niche.

527
00:27:32,185 --> 00:27:33,607
You're making the game better for everybody.

528
00:27:33,927 --> 00:27:36,249
Because what's a complete game-stopping barrier

529
00:27:36,289 --> 00:27:38,210
for one person is probably still a bit of annoyance

530
00:27:38,230 --> 00:27:38,851
for everybody else.

531
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:43,234
So they actually found that the camera assist

532
00:27:43,935 --> 00:27:45,536
for playing one-handed, that's actually used

533
00:27:45,576 --> 00:27:46,857
by a third of their players.

534
00:27:49,519 --> 00:27:50,480
They also had some really nice

535
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:51,981
accidental accessibility as well.

536
00:27:53,704 --> 00:27:57,528
So if you played Uncharted, you probably know they have a whole bunch of modes you can unlock,

537
00:27:57,548 --> 00:27:59,130
which are just intended as a bit of fun.

538
00:28:00,211 --> 00:28:03,535
That includes a slow motion mode and a slow motion aiming mode,

539
00:28:04,156 --> 00:28:07,299
which is really, really helpful for people who've got impaired motor ability.

540
00:28:09,121 --> 00:28:11,945
It also includes this, which is something called thief vision.

541
00:28:13,542 --> 00:28:15,604
As you can see, what it's doing with the contrast,

542
00:28:15,644 --> 00:28:18,465
with the edge detection, this is actually unintentionally

543
00:28:18,526 --> 00:28:20,947
making the game accessible to people who are legally blind.

544
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:24,369
So that means people who aren't completely blind,

545
00:28:24,850 --> 00:28:25,930
but have a low enough vision that

546
00:28:25,970 --> 00:28:28,292
has a significant impact on their lives,

547
00:28:28,672 --> 00:28:31,394
they can still play just based on this accidental feature.

548
00:28:33,829 --> 00:28:38,031
All this stuff is really nice, but it isn't the real reason why Uncharted is important.

549
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:43,514
The reason why the accessibility in Uncharted is important is because it's in Uncharted.

550
00:28:45,475 --> 00:28:49,476
So going back to what I was saying earlier about misconceptions, another common misconception

551
00:28:50,177 --> 00:28:53,578
is that thinking about accessibility is going to make your game less fun.

552
00:28:54,819 --> 00:28:57,800
It's going to dilute down your ideas to suit the lowest common denominator.

553
00:29:00,028 --> 00:29:05,130
It doesn't take very long, looking at Uncharted's critical reception, its meta-critic, its sales

554
00:29:05,170 --> 00:29:07,670
figures, to see that that is completely false.

555
00:29:10,831 --> 00:29:15,172
And the other reason it's really important is because being such a high-profile game,

556
00:29:15,933 --> 00:29:17,773
it makes other developers sit up and take notice.

557
00:29:19,273 --> 00:29:22,474
And there's historical precedent for that as well, because, you know, I was saying color

558
00:29:22,494 --> 00:29:25,355
blindness, I'm sure you're all aware, color blindness is a pretty common thing to consider

559
00:29:25,375 --> 00:29:25,515
now.

560
00:29:26,395 --> 00:29:27,576
In 2014 it wasn't.

561
00:29:27,956 --> 00:29:28,896
It was really, really rare.

562
00:29:30,218 --> 00:29:36,619
It wasn't until three games in 2014, which was Borderlands 2, Sim City, and Black Ops 2,

563
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,080
they implemented colourblind modes.

564
00:29:40,260 --> 00:29:42,901
It was big, big news, like front page news.

565
00:29:43,341 --> 00:29:46,001
And as soon as that happened, people knew about colourblindness,

566
00:29:46,181 --> 00:29:47,362
other people started implementing it.

567
00:29:47,962 --> 00:29:49,862
And we're already seeing this with Uncharted.

568
00:29:50,562 --> 00:29:53,023
Everything from the one-man indies to the big publishers

569
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:56,164
are actually taking notice and thinking a lot more about accessibility

570
00:29:56,284 --> 00:29:57,444
as a direct result of this game.

571
00:30:02,777 --> 00:30:03,978
And it isn't by accident either.

572
00:30:04,478 --> 00:30:06,899
They made a lot of effort to actually tell people

573
00:30:07,340 --> 00:30:08,841
about their functionality.

574
00:30:12,042 --> 00:30:13,703
And they aren't the only people to be doing it either.

575
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:15,984
So down at the other end of the scale,

576
00:30:16,365 --> 00:30:19,046
this is an indie game called Legacy of the Elder Star.

577
00:30:19,887 --> 00:30:22,468
What this is is screenshots from the trailer from the game.

578
00:30:22,488 --> 00:30:26,170
So they've dedicated a whole chunk of their trailer

579
00:30:26,790 --> 00:30:28,831
just telling people about their accessibility features.

580
00:30:30,699 --> 00:30:34,940
Which kind of seems like an obvious thing to do, tell people about your accessibility features, but a lot of developers don't.

581
00:30:36,341 --> 00:30:42,382
That's the worst situation you can be in. If you dedicate a time and energy and money into putting this stuff into place, and gamers don't find it.

582
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:44,983
So really, really important to tell people about what you've done.

583
00:30:47,584 --> 00:30:51,785
It doesn't have to be through fantasy videos either. It can be other means, such as in Final Fantasy.

584
00:30:53,723 --> 00:30:55,184
This is something I've never seen before.

585
00:30:56,265 --> 00:30:58,647
So in Final Fantasy XV, they've actually included

586
00:30:58,667 --> 00:31:01,028
accessibility information in the printed manual.

587
00:31:04,471 --> 00:31:06,072
But it doesn't need to be as fancy as that either.

588
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:11,316
This is going back to Hue, that color-based platform game.

589
00:31:12,397 --> 00:31:15,900
They included one single bullet point about the colorblind

590
00:31:15,940 --> 00:31:17,361
mode in their press release.

591
00:31:18,758 --> 00:31:22,239
As a result, something in the region of 20 different outlets

592
00:31:22,299 --> 00:31:23,439
picked up on the code that I made,

593
00:31:24,019 --> 00:31:25,419
gave it a really, really good reception.

594
00:31:26,700 --> 00:31:28,240
And he actually gave a talk about it on Monday,

595
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:30,981
and he reckons it actually pushed up his Metacritic score

596
00:31:31,141 --> 00:31:33,401
by a few points, just from including that one bullet

597
00:31:33,441 --> 00:31:34,162
point in his press release.

598
00:31:35,042 --> 00:31:36,702
So it's nice we're getting some good PR from as well.

599
00:31:39,723 --> 00:31:41,123
And game developers aren't the only people

600
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:43,884
who are telling gamers about accessibility functionality.

601
00:31:47,014 --> 00:31:51,237
This year, Game Critics started including this kind of information in their reviews.

602
00:31:52,939 --> 00:31:56,081
Game Critics is a mainstream game review site.

603
00:31:57,082 --> 00:32:00,204
And as of this year, on every single review they put out,

604
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:05,588
they include information on colour blindness, controls, and hearing accessibility.

605
00:32:11,145 --> 00:32:13,486
And on this topic of dialogue, dialogue is a two-way thing.

606
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:16,447
So it's not just about you giving information to gamers

607
00:32:16,467 --> 00:32:17,267
about accessibility.

608
00:32:17,507 --> 00:32:19,687
It's about you getting information from gamers about

609
00:32:19,707 --> 00:32:20,588
accessibility as well.

610
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:26,349
And this is a really nice example of that.

611
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:27,930
This is earlier last year.

612
00:32:28,770 --> 00:32:30,890
Karen Stevens, who's the person who's giving the talk

613
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:32,931
about the Madden accessibility, she's actually

614
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:36,492
set up an email address and a Twitter account specifically

615
00:32:36,552 --> 00:32:38,052
for receiving accessibility feedback.

616
00:32:38,192 --> 00:32:39,713
And she then routes that to all the various

617
00:32:39,733 --> 00:32:40,673
different EA studios.

618
00:32:43,404 --> 00:32:45,386
There's been explicit calls for feedback as well.

619
00:32:46,266 --> 00:32:48,768
This is a survey that went out from Fail Better Games,

620
00:32:49,729 --> 00:32:51,691
asking for input from the community on ideas

621
00:32:51,731 --> 00:32:52,952
of how to make the games more accessible.

622
00:32:57,515 --> 00:32:59,777
This is the same thing again from Cliff Bleszinski.

623
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,542
And this is actually following on from an experience

624
00:33:05,582 --> 00:33:08,164
that Cliff had earlier in the year that he wrote about.

625
00:33:10,140 --> 00:33:13,202
So this is from a meeting that he had with a group of

626
00:33:13,382 --> 00:33:14,543
young veterans.

627
00:33:27,829 --> 00:33:28,370
So Cliff there.

628
00:33:28,430 --> 00:33:33,232
Cliff isn't the only example of high-level support and

629
00:33:33,252 --> 00:33:35,473
recognition for accessibility that's been happening.

630
00:33:36,254 --> 00:33:38,435
This recognition goes all the way to the very top.

631
00:33:40,566 --> 00:33:45,168
So in the past year, Able Gamers, which is an accessibility charity in the USA,

632
00:33:45,328 --> 00:33:47,709
were invited to speak about accessibility at the White House.

633
00:33:51,711 --> 00:33:54,352
Special Effect, who are an accessibility charity in the UK,

634
00:33:54,853 --> 00:33:57,334
their new facility was opened not just by the Prime Minister,

635
00:33:57,794 --> 00:34:00,936
but by a delegation of senior politicians from across the political divide.

636
00:34:02,056 --> 00:34:04,457
And there's all kinds of nice quotes that came out of this.

637
00:34:04,697 --> 00:34:05,298
This is one of them.

638
00:34:06,278 --> 00:34:09,079
It's probably not going to mean a huge amount to you if you're not from the UK.

639
00:34:10,573 --> 00:34:13,616
To understand it, basically it replaced Mr. Cameron

640
00:34:13,636 --> 00:34:16,159
for Mr. Trump and Tom Watson for Bernie Sanders.

641
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:20,062
So you can see, in the UK, this is kind of a big deal,

642
00:34:21,043 --> 00:34:23,506
this kind of real, real high-level support and backing

643
00:34:23,626 --> 00:34:25,928
and understanding of the importance of accessibility.

644
00:34:28,046 --> 00:34:30,747
But back in the games industry, there's been this kind of high level support as well.

645
00:34:30,987 --> 00:34:35,689
So at E3 last year, there was the Gaming for Everyone initiative announced by Microsoft.

646
00:34:36,409 --> 00:34:42,952
And this is kind of a general inclusivity and diversity initiative that explicitly includes

647
00:34:43,012 --> 00:34:44,652
accessibility for gamers with disabilities.

648
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:51,255
And this is a quote from Phil Spencer, head of Xbox, about that.

649
00:34:59,625 --> 00:35:02,628
So this kind of statement about the importance of accessibility,

650
00:35:02,748 --> 00:35:05,430
you know, a couple of years ago, this just would have been unimaginable.

651
00:35:09,474 --> 00:35:11,635
Another quote here from Phil Spencer as well.

652
00:35:16,159 --> 00:35:19,682
So just to explain exactly what this is, this is the head of Xbox

653
00:35:20,082 --> 00:35:24,146
praising a PlayStation exclusive game. This is not something that happens every day.

654
00:35:26,468 --> 00:35:27,789
And PlayStation themselves as well.

655
00:35:29,490 --> 00:35:32,411
At PlayStation Experience, which is their annual consumer event,

656
00:35:32,751 --> 00:35:36,053
they hosted a panel specifically on accessibility.

657
00:35:36,873 --> 00:35:38,174
This isn't something that's happened before.

658
00:35:42,436 --> 00:35:43,797
And this is a quote from Sean Laiden,

659
00:35:44,017 --> 00:35:46,538
chair of Sony Worldwide Studios, from the start of that event.

660
00:35:56,402 --> 00:35:58,363
So you can see, we really want to be leaders in this field.

661
00:35:59,933 --> 00:36:03,436
This kind of high level support and backing for accessibility isn't something that there's

662
00:36:03,456 --> 00:36:04,216
really been before.

663
00:36:05,617 --> 00:36:06,518
And it's so important.

664
00:36:07,639 --> 00:36:12,282
Because over the years, speaking to developers on the ground who really, really want to do

665
00:36:12,702 --> 00:36:16,845
nice stuff, implement nice features, but they just haven't been able to because they can't

666
00:36:16,865 --> 00:36:20,428
get it up the chain, up onto the backlog, because management, you know, don't believe

667
00:36:20,448 --> 00:36:21,849
in the ROI, all that kind of stuff.

668
00:36:25,872 --> 00:36:26,632
You need that stuff.

669
00:36:27,939 --> 00:36:32,061
If you want to enact lasting cultural change, it has to come from multiple angles.

670
00:36:33,602 --> 00:36:38,345
You need to have people on the ground who understand what's required, who want to do

671
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:38,705
the work.

672
00:36:40,427 --> 00:36:44,629
You have to have people at the top who believe in it, who are willing to empower their staff

673
00:36:44,649 --> 00:36:45,450
to make those changes.

674
00:36:47,791 --> 00:36:51,574
And you also need to have pressure externally, so you need to have the public, the gamers,

675
00:36:52,014 --> 00:36:55,056
letting industry know that this is important, this is something that they want to see.

676
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,632
And now, for the first time, we're actually starting to see

677
00:37:00,972 --> 00:37:03,814
all those three pieces start to slot into place.

678
00:37:05,434 --> 00:37:08,876
So that means that now, like never before, we have a real

679
00:37:08,896 --> 00:37:12,318
opportunity to enact lasting, positive change to the

680
00:37:12,358 --> 00:37:12,758
industry.

681
00:37:13,459 --> 00:37:15,280
We just have to reach out and take it.

682
00:37:18,261 --> 00:37:18,462
Thanks.

683
00:37:26,748 --> 00:37:30,191
So as I said, this was just covering a few key themes.

684
00:37:30,712 --> 00:37:32,994
The first link on there is a much longer version.

685
00:37:33,194 --> 00:37:34,916
It's basically all the nice stuff that happened over the

686
00:37:34,936 --> 00:37:37,699
last year, and the quotes as well.

687
00:37:38,179 --> 00:37:39,981
The next link down, game advocacy.

688
00:37:40,842 --> 00:37:43,504
If you want to get involved in bringing these advances about,

689
00:37:43,624 --> 00:37:45,506
there's lots of ideas of things you can do to help

690
00:37:45,566 --> 00:37:46,347
push the field forward.

691
00:37:47,568 --> 00:37:49,288
Then lastly, game accessibility guidelines.

692
00:37:49,568 --> 00:37:51,369
If you want to implement accessibility features

693
00:37:51,469 --> 00:37:53,089
into your own games, that gives you

694
00:37:53,129 --> 00:37:54,789
loads of good suggestions of things you can do,

695
00:37:55,049 --> 00:37:56,789
examples of good practices, stuff like that.

696
00:37:58,530 --> 00:37:59,110
And lastly, me.

697
00:37:59,990 --> 00:38:00,870
I'm always keen to chat.

698
00:38:01,230 --> 00:38:01,950
If there's anything you ever want

699
00:38:01,970 --> 00:38:03,811
to know about accessibility, anything you want to chat

700
00:38:03,851 --> 00:38:06,611
through, anything you want to rant about, get in touch.

701
00:38:06,631 --> 00:38:07,691
I'll happily talk your ear off.

702
00:38:09,372 --> 00:38:09,952
So that's me.

703
00:38:10,112 --> 00:38:11,212
We've got a bit of time.

704
00:38:11,452 --> 00:38:13,232
If anyone's got any questions, I'm more than happy.

705
00:38:13,312 --> 00:38:14,913
If there's anything you're uncomfortable asking now,

706
00:38:14,953 --> 00:38:16,533
just hit me up afterwards, and we can have a chat.

707
00:38:19,682 --> 00:38:25,746
Any takers? Anyone want to start me off?

708
00:38:25,766 --> 00:38:36,433
So, question for you. You held up Unity's Action Map as maybe an example of a way that a middleware provider could make it easier for game developers to build accessibility in their games.

709
00:38:37,458 --> 00:38:41,001
Can you talk a little bit about other opportunities the platform holders or the middleware vendors

710
00:38:41,502 --> 00:38:45,425
have that could make it easy to do some of the other things that you talked about today?

711
00:38:45,906 --> 00:38:46,866
Yeah, absolutely.

712
00:38:47,147 --> 00:38:51,170
So this is a potential for things like middleware to make it easier for developers to do this

713
00:38:51,210 --> 00:38:51,650
kind of stuff.

714
00:38:52,051 --> 00:38:53,552
There's huge, huge possibilities there.

715
00:38:53,852 --> 00:38:57,355
Because historically, engines have been a blocker to accessibility.

716
00:38:57,716 --> 00:38:58,857
They really could be an enabler.

717
00:39:00,518 --> 00:39:03,260
So yeah, the remapping is a really good example.

718
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,021
Another one is subtitling,

719
00:39:05,461 --> 00:39:07,923
because a lot of the things I was talking about, those good practices,

720
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,584
they can be addressed at an engine level.

721
00:39:10,425 --> 00:39:12,306
Because often the problems you get are because

722
00:39:13,607 --> 00:39:15,889
of the way that subtitles fit into the production pipeline.

723
00:39:16,689 --> 00:39:19,271
You can't actually produce the subtitles themselves

724
00:39:19,471 --> 00:39:20,352
until you have the audio.

725
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:22,594
You don't get the finalized audio until the end.

726
00:39:23,114 --> 00:39:26,056
People then build a system without any time and any resources,

727
00:39:26,136 --> 00:39:27,217
and it's just kind of a bit hacky.

728
00:39:29,040 --> 00:39:33,310
If it was done at an engine level, you would get developers who would get to that point,

729
00:39:33,530 --> 00:39:36,817
say, oh my god, the engine does it for me, I'll put it into my game, I'll just use that, amazing.

730
00:39:38,272 --> 00:39:42,653
If what is built by the engine at the engine level has all these nice good practices built

731
00:39:42,713 --> 00:39:46,294
in, that means that those developers, even those developers who quickly chuck it in a

732
00:39:46,314 --> 00:39:49,795
rush have got all that really nice accessibility functionality in there from the start.

733
00:39:50,535 --> 00:39:54,877
So just the things like the ability to customize the letterboxing, like having a decent default

734
00:39:54,897 --> 00:39:58,158
size, all that kind of stuff can be nicely handled at engine level and stop people having

735
00:39:58,198 --> 00:40:01,439
to reinvent the wheel every time, especially when they're reinventing the wheel as a square

736
00:40:01,459 --> 00:40:02,099
every time as well.

737
00:40:03,373 --> 00:40:04,196
Yeah, that's one example.

738
00:40:04,598 --> 00:40:08,291
One that I'd really, really love to see some progress on is screen readers.

739
00:40:09,012 --> 00:40:13,072
So that's the technology that people who are blind use to access technology.

740
00:40:16,173 --> 00:40:18,653
So basically, it just reads out text strings or what's on the screen,

741
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:19,654
whatever is on screen.

742
00:40:20,134 --> 00:40:22,734
It works really nicely on mobile devices.

743
00:40:23,654 --> 00:40:25,495
So this is on any mobile devices you've got,

744
00:40:25,515 --> 00:40:28,655
whether it's Android, iOS, Windows Phone.

745
00:40:28,695 --> 00:40:31,616
You just turn on the screen reader and it changes how gestures work.

746
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:35,056
So anything that you would normally do with two fingers,

747
00:40:35,677 --> 00:40:38,017
sorry, with one finger, you have to use two fingers for instead.

748
00:40:38,937 --> 00:40:43,103
That frees up one finger, so you can run your finger over the surface of the screen,

749
00:40:44,024 --> 00:40:48,450
and through synthesized speech, it speaks out the label of anything your finger moves over.

750
00:40:48,470 --> 00:40:52,835
So you can actually use your finger like an eye and visualize what's on the screen.

751
00:40:53,556 --> 00:40:56,280
So stuff like interface-based games is really perfectly suited for.

752
00:40:57,581 --> 00:41:03,987
It doesn't work with engines, because engines don't output native operating system interface elements,

753
00:41:04,007 --> 00:41:05,428
they output just a bunch of pixels.

754
00:41:06,128 --> 00:41:10,272
That's something that engine developers could address, and if they did it would make a huge, huge difference.

755
00:41:11,052 --> 00:41:13,595
And, I don't know, if I can steal Evelyn's thunder?

756
00:41:14,504 --> 00:41:14,984
Yep, sure.

757
00:41:15,404 --> 00:41:19,688
So there's a talk tomorrow by Evelyn Thomas.

758
00:41:20,248 --> 00:41:23,091
Is she also a program manager?

759
00:41:23,111 --> 00:41:24,592
Evelyn's a program manager on Xbox.

760
00:41:24,612 --> 00:41:26,573
Yeah, program manager for accessibility at Xbox.

761
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,275
In her talk tomorrow, she's going

762
00:41:28,295 --> 00:41:32,298
to be talking about a new API on the Xbox that

763
00:41:32,338 --> 00:41:34,560
allows developers to access text to speech.

764
00:41:35,281 --> 00:41:37,422
So game developers can actually make their interfaces blind

765
00:41:37,442 --> 00:41:38,283
accessible on the Xbox.

766
00:41:38,784 --> 00:41:40,745
That's the kind of thing that could be done at engine level.

767
00:41:41,766 --> 00:41:44,247
Because all the engines have decent UI systems built in,

768
00:41:44,607 --> 00:41:47,388
if they automatically passed out the labels of those interface elements,

769
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:49,388
then there'd be a lot of interface-based games

770
00:41:49,408 --> 00:41:52,569
that would just be blind accessible by default with no effort from developers.

771
00:41:53,229 --> 00:41:55,350
Which is how it works with natively built games.

772
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:57,531
It'd be amazing to see engine-based games doing that as well.

773
00:41:58,451 --> 00:41:59,711
But yeah, really good question.

774
00:41:59,731 --> 00:42:02,652
There's a lot of potential for good from middleware engines.

775
00:42:05,833 --> 00:42:06,373
Any other takers?

776
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,906
Right, we're good. Good stuff. Thank you.
