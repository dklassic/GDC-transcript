1
00:00:04,945 --> 00:00:08,809
I've been told to tell you in advance that you should silence your cell phones if you

2
00:00:08,829 --> 00:00:14,715
haven't already, and that also, please, when it's all over, if you can fill out the evaluation

3
00:00:14,755 --> 00:00:16,537
form, that would be really great.

4
00:00:17,478 --> 00:00:22,463
And so without much further ado, I'm just going to launch right into 30 things I hate

5
00:00:22,503 --> 00:00:23,344
about your game pitch.

6
00:00:24,358 --> 00:00:27,320
First, let me give you a little bit of background about why you should even care what I think

7
00:00:27,360 --> 00:00:31,963
about your game pitch. I've been in the industry for 20 years. I started off as the creative

8
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:37,087
director for Red Storm Entertainment. I designed Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon, but for the last

9
00:00:37,587 --> 00:00:42,570
14 years, I was a senior game designer at Sony Santa Monica. I only recently left to

10
00:00:42,611 --> 00:00:47,094
go independent. And for a lot of that time, I was one of the guys you pitched to.

11
00:00:47,714 --> 00:00:53,277
probably, and I heard several hundred pitches during that time, so that there was a lot

12
00:00:53,337 --> 00:00:55,318
of stuff that I saw.

13
00:00:55,378 --> 00:01:00,101
And it gives you a unique perspective on it, because if you're the person doing the pitching,

14
00:01:00,141 --> 00:01:04,243
you may only do a handful of pitches in your career, but if you're the person receiving

15
00:01:04,263 --> 00:01:08,286
the pitching, then you see a lot, and you get to see patterns in how people pitch.

16
00:01:09,186 --> 00:01:14,310
And so the genesis of this talk was last year at GDC,

17
00:01:14,550 --> 00:01:16,271
I took a whole bunch of pitches and I was talking

18
00:01:16,311 --> 00:01:18,833
to one of the people I was listening with,

19
00:01:19,153 --> 00:01:23,095
and we were just shocked at how many mistakes people made,

20
00:01:23,236 --> 00:01:25,917
and particularly people made, even who'd been

21
00:01:25,937 --> 00:01:27,578
in the industry for a really long time,

22
00:01:27,619 --> 00:01:29,440
people with 10 or 15 years experience

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:30,701
still doing really bad pitches.

24
00:01:31,421 --> 00:01:33,402
And we always try to give people a fair shake.

25
00:01:33,422 --> 00:01:35,063
We weren't trying to hold things against them.

26
00:01:35,443 --> 00:01:37,604
But at the same time, there's some really obvious things

27
00:01:37,624 --> 00:01:38,324
people were doing.

28
00:01:38,464 --> 00:01:41,606
And so that was the genesis of where this talk came from.

29
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:49,960
So when I was looking at pitches, there were really two

30
00:01:50,060 --> 00:01:50,780
big questions.

31
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:52,561
There's really two things that I want to know.

32
00:01:53,361 --> 00:01:55,922
And that is, is this game worth making?

33
00:01:56,663 --> 00:01:57,983
And can this team make it?

34
00:01:58,103 --> 00:02:00,324
And anything that's not directed toward answering one

35
00:02:00,344 --> 00:02:03,966
of these questions in some form, it doesn't really need

36
00:02:03,986 --> 00:02:04,586
to be in your pitch.

37
00:02:04,626 --> 00:02:08,368
Or if it's in your pitch, you need to play it down in

38
00:02:08,408 --> 00:02:10,349
exchange for answering one of these questions in a

39
00:02:10,389 --> 00:02:11,029
meaningful way.

40
00:02:12,109 --> 00:02:14,690
So since I only have 30 minutes and I have 30 things,

41
00:02:15,891 --> 00:02:16,851
let's let the hate begin.

42
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:22,883
Number one, I don't give a crap about your back story.

43
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:26,826
A lot of people start off their pitches trying to introduce you to their game world.

44
00:02:26,866 --> 00:02:33,111
You hear 20 minutes of the complete political situation on some fantasy continent or what

45
00:02:33,151 --> 00:02:34,812
the childhood of your protagonist was.

46
00:02:35,572 --> 00:02:38,054
And this really doesn't help sell your game at all.

47
00:02:38,955 --> 00:02:41,937
If you think also about what you go about when you try to buy a game.

48
00:02:42,658 --> 00:02:45,681
You may enjoy knowing all the information while you're playing, but at the point of

49
00:02:45,721 --> 00:02:49,624
purchase when you're deciding whether or not you actually want to have that game, you don't

50
00:02:49,725 --> 00:02:50,745
know all that backstory.

51
00:02:50,765 --> 00:02:55,470
And if your game can't stand alone with a huge dump of what the backstory is, that's

52
00:02:55,510 --> 00:02:56,010
a problem.

53
00:02:56,030 --> 00:02:58,533
And it's a problem that can be addressed even at the pitching stage.

54
00:02:59,153 --> 00:02:59,333
So...

55
00:03:00,194 --> 00:03:03,237
First off, 20 minutes of lore will not sell your game.

56
00:03:04,699 --> 00:03:07,822
A rule of thumb, look at how the original Star Wars begins.

57
00:03:07,842 --> 00:03:09,464
You have a really quick text crawl.

58
00:03:09,824 --> 00:03:12,828
It sets up what the situation is, and then you're on into

59
00:03:12,868 --> 00:03:13,348
the action.

60
00:03:13,749 --> 00:03:15,350
If you need to set things up, try to set

61
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:16,291
them up that quickly.

62
00:03:18,498 --> 00:03:21,060
Number two, I don't give a crap about your inventory system,

63
00:03:21,140 --> 00:03:21,360
either.

64
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:25,202
And another pattern that I would see when people would pitch

65
00:03:25,682 --> 00:03:28,844
is that they would explain in great detail systems

66
00:03:28,864 --> 00:03:29,864
that are very standard.

67
00:03:30,685 --> 00:03:32,626
So if it's central to your game that you

68
00:03:32,646 --> 00:03:35,067
have a really unique and different inventory system,

69
00:03:35,087 --> 00:03:36,448
if that's something that's really

70
00:03:36,548 --> 00:03:39,249
different about how your game plays, by all means, yeah,

71
00:03:39,269 --> 00:03:39,949
showcase that.

72
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:45,271
But the pitch is not a place to just do a general dump of every mechanic you have, because

73
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:48,873
a lot of times if you say, oh, yeah, we've got inventory management, that's all you need

74
00:03:48,913 --> 00:03:49,353
to say.

75
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,454
So number two, don't explain standard features.

76
00:03:53,014 --> 00:03:56,535
If anything's there, it needs to be there because it is really core to the concept.

77
00:03:59,241 --> 00:04:02,224
Number three, I'm not going to design your game for you.

78
00:04:03,065 --> 00:04:05,187
A lot of times people would come in to do pitches,

79
00:04:05,888 --> 00:04:07,310
and they would start off with questions.

80
00:04:07,930 --> 00:04:09,152
What sort of game do you want to see?

81
00:04:09,812 --> 00:04:11,354
Or they would give you two different options,

82
00:04:11,394 --> 00:04:13,797
like we're thinking about making this first or third person.

83
00:04:13,957 --> 00:04:15,318
What do you think it should be?

84
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:18,219
That's not the place to do that.

85
00:04:19,400 --> 00:04:23,400
If a company is interested in hearing different options,

86
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:25,381
they may ask you about that later on in the pitch.

87
00:04:25,841 --> 00:04:27,041
But when you start things off,

88
00:04:27,321 --> 00:04:29,822
you want to pitch what your creative vision is,

89
00:04:30,282 --> 00:04:32,242
what the game is that you want to make

90
00:04:32,302 --> 00:04:33,442
and why you want to make it.

91
00:04:33,922 --> 00:04:35,863
Don't ask the person that you're pitching to

92
00:04:36,683 --> 00:04:39,223
to answer questions about what they're looking for

93
00:04:39,303 --> 00:04:40,323
or what they're trying to accomplish.

94
00:04:40,364 --> 00:04:41,284
If they want something different,

95
00:04:41,304 --> 00:04:42,944
they'll tell you or they'll ask you.

96
00:04:43,564 --> 00:04:46,107
So number three, don't ask me what I want,

97
00:04:46,528 --> 00:04:47,989
tell me what you want to do.

98
00:04:48,230 --> 00:04:49,731
Tell me what game you want to make.

99
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:55,017
Number four, game pillars are not hooks.

100
00:04:56,178 --> 00:04:58,500
One of the things that we would always look for to

101
00:04:58,540 --> 00:05:01,102
determine if a game was worth making is, what is the hook?

102
00:05:01,603 --> 00:05:03,625
What is the unique thing that's going to make this

103
00:05:03,745 --> 00:05:06,888
different, that's going to make it stand out from all the

104
00:05:06,928 --> 00:05:07,949
other games that are out there?

105
00:05:08,349 --> 00:05:10,090
And a lot of times, people would think that if they would

106
00:05:10,131 --> 00:05:13,714
say, oh, here are our pillars, that that would satisfy the

107
00:05:13,794 --> 00:05:15,736
need for what the hook of the game is.

108
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,098
We want to have a really strong fantasy story in a really

109
00:05:19,158 --> 00:05:21,339
detailed world, and it's going to be all about

110
00:05:21,379 --> 00:05:22,160
hand-to-hand combat.

111
00:05:22,180 --> 00:05:22,920
Yeah, those are pillars.

112
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:25,862
Those help keep you on track while you're making the game.

113
00:05:26,242 --> 00:05:28,904
But an important part of pitching is to tell the person

114
00:05:28,924 --> 00:05:31,205
you're pitching to why somebody would buy this game

115
00:05:31,526 --> 00:05:34,167
instead of something else that's already out there.

116
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:38,370
So very early on in your pitch, one of the key things

117
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:41,572
you need to emphasize is, what is it that makes your game

118
00:05:41,672 --> 00:05:42,833
unique and different from everything

119
00:05:42,873 --> 00:05:43,533
else that's out there?

120
00:05:45,418 --> 00:05:49,039
Number five, you never explain to me what the player does.

121
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:52,120
And this often is tied into the lack of a hook.

122
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,200
You have, I would receive game pitches

123
00:05:54,741 --> 00:05:58,181
and people would like talk about how beautiful the world was

124
00:05:58,241 --> 00:06:00,622
and what the setting was and what their story was

125
00:06:00,662 --> 00:06:02,302
and what their monetization model was.

126
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,123
But when it came time to actually describing

127
00:06:05,423 --> 00:06:07,103
the moment to moment gameplay,

128
00:06:07,723 --> 00:06:09,864
the experience of the player, it would never be mentioned.

129
00:06:10,384 --> 00:06:11,924
Or they would mention sort of offhandedly,

130
00:06:11,984 --> 00:06:12,885
oh yeah, it's a platformer.

131
00:06:13,525 --> 00:06:15,827
Okay, what kind of, how is it different?

132
00:06:15,867 --> 00:06:17,269
Why do I want to play this platformer

133
00:06:17,289 --> 00:06:19,291
instead of the hundred other platformers

134
00:06:19,311 --> 00:06:20,031
that are already out there?

135
00:06:20,732 --> 00:06:22,093
If you don't have something unique,

136
00:06:22,354 --> 00:06:24,556
you need to think about what is going to be unique

137
00:06:24,576 --> 00:06:26,318
before you get to the point where you're actually pitching.

138
00:06:27,078 --> 00:06:28,700
And describe your mechanics.

139
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,962
Be able to talk through moment to moment

140
00:06:31,263 --> 00:06:32,424
what it's gonna be like for the player

141
00:06:32,744 --> 00:06:33,945
to hold the controller in their hand

142
00:06:33,965 --> 00:06:35,447
and what they're actually going to be doing.

143
00:06:38,116 --> 00:06:40,821
Number six, in the real world no one can double jump.

144
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:45,169
And what I mean by this is don't use realism

145
00:06:45,349 --> 00:06:47,634
as a way to excuse elements of your design.

146
00:06:48,430 --> 00:06:51,191
A lot of times when you're pitching, you'll be discussing why you made certain creative

147
00:06:51,231 --> 00:06:53,231
choices, why you have a certain vision.

148
00:06:53,671 --> 00:06:57,653
Whenever somebody would say something along the lines of, oh yeah, we made this choice

149
00:06:57,673 --> 00:07:01,054
because you can't really do this, we wanted something that would...

150
00:07:01,314 --> 00:07:05,375
Unless you're doing a real hardcore simulation, unless the whole selling point of your game

151
00:07:05,735 --> 00:07:09,296
is that it's absolutely true to the world, don't excuse design decisions.

152
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:12,239
by saying, oh, that's the way it really is.

153
00:07:12,279 --> 00:07:14,301
Because for the most part, almost everything you do in a game

154
00:07:14,361 --> 00:07:15,583
is unreal in some way.

155
00:07:16,083 --> 00:07:18,026
And so justify your design decisions

156
00:07:18,707 --> 00:07:19,528
with real reasons,

157
00:07:20,068 --> 00:07:21,790
rather than just appealing to realism.

158
00:07:22,571 --> 00:07:23,793
And something that's related to that,

159
00:07:24,934 --> 00:07:26,255
many times I'd get pitched a game

160
00:07:26,275 --> 00:07:27,417
and it would have a frame story.

161
00:07:28,118 --> 00:07:28,798
It's a game show.

162
00:07:29,945 --> 00:07:31,827
If you pitch something as a game show, I start thinking,

163
00:07:31,867 --> 00:07:34,970
well, why do you even need a frame story?

164
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:37,372
Because game shows themselves don't have frame stories.

165
00:07:37,412 --> 00:07:39,894
The frame story of a game show is that it's a game show.

166
00:07:40,375 --> 00:07:42,457
So if you have a game, and it has a really cool mechanic,

167
00:07:42,497 --> 00:07:45,379
and it's fun to play, you don't necessarily need to put

168
00:07:45,439 --> 00:07:47,281
a wrapper around it to explain while

169
00:07:47,301 --> 00:07:48,262
the player is doing it.

170
00:07:49,263 --> 00:07:51,644
If you really have a reason to do a game show game, by all

171
00:07:51,684 --> 00:07:52,224
means, do it.

172
00:07:52,264 --> 00:07:53,424
Don't let me stop you.

173
00:07:53,924 --> 00:07:58,426
But don't feel the need to justify actions by some sort

174
00:07:58,446 --> 00:08:01,207
of artificial frame that you put around it.

175
00:08:02,727 --> 00:08:05,148
So if your frame story for your game is that it's a game

176
00:08:05,188 --> 00:08:07,208
show, you probably actually don't need a frame story.

177
00:08:07,588 --> 00:08:08,229
Just leave that off.

178
00:08:08,269 --> 00:08:09,189
It makes everything simpler.

179
00:08:11,542 --> 00:08:16,507
Number eight, it's a parody. I always get very suspicious when I'm pitched a game that

180
00:08:16,627 --> 00:08:22,532
says ‑‑ where the person explains that it's a parody, because I wind up thinking

181
00:08:23,928 --> 00:08:24,889
Is it really a parody?

182
00:08:24,969 --> 00:08:26,229
Is it really just a crappy game?

183
00:08:26,709 --> 00:08:28,310
Did you really start out to make something

184
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:29,390
that was serious and good,

185
00:08:29,770 --> 00:08:31,211
and then discover that you didn't get it?

186
00:08:31,271 --> 00:08:32,951
And so you say, okay, I'm gonna lampshade it.

187
00:08:33,491 --> 00:08:36,332
So again, I'm not saying don't make parody games,

188
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:39,613
but announcing up front that it is a parody

189
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:41,234
sets off alarm bells.

190
00:08:41,274 --> 00:08:43,734
It makes me suspicious that there is something in the game

191
00:08:44,035 --> 00:08:45,355
that is off or wrong,

192
00:08:45,655 --> 00:08:47,275
that you don't feel like it could stand on its own

193
00:08:47,456 --> 00:08:48,576
without being taken as a joke.

194
00:08:51,383 --> 00:08:54,905
Oh, I just completely screwed up my presentation there.

195
00:08:55,446 --> 00:08:57,327
Number nine, you never mention

196
00:08:57,347 --> 00:08:59,928
your glaring obvious tech risk.

197
00:09:00,249 --> 00:09:02,750
And this goes into, can this team succeed in making it?

198
00:09:03,111 --> 00:09:05,612
A lot of times, if you see a lot of pitches,

199
00:09:05,632 --> 00:09:08,094
and if you've been working on the publisher side a lot,

200
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:10,555
you kind of know what's feasible and what's not.

201
00:09:10,976 --> 00:09:12,337
And you know what things are hard to do

202
00:09:12,357 --> 00:09:13,777
and what things are easy to do.

203
00:09:13,797 --> 00:09:14,798
And if somebody comes in and says,

204
00:09:14,838 --> 00:09:18,861
yeah, we want to do a 1,000-person multiplayer game

205
00:09:18,881 --> 00:09:20,502
with real-time firefights,

206
00:09:21,883 --> 00:09:22,923
then alarm bells go off.

207
00:09:22,963 --> 00:09:24,865
And it's fine to do something

208
00:09:24,885 --> 00:09:26,265
that's really technologically ambitious.

209
00:09:26,325 --> 00:09:28,547
It's fine to do something that's really dangerous and hard.

210
00:09:29,087 --> 00:09:32,009
But if you say something like that that sounds dangerous and hard

211
00:09:32,289 --> 00:09:34,871
and then you don't explain how you're going to pull that off,

212
00:09:35,351 --> 00:09:37,492
then that really makes people nervous.

213
00:09:38,173 --> 00:09:39,994
So taking a big risk is great,

214
00:09:40,494 --> 00:09:42,155
but if you know you're taking a big risk,

215
00:09:42,395 --> 00:09:44,617
then you need to tell people that you're taking a big risk

216
00:09:44,937 --> 00:09:46,798
and you need to acknowledge what you're going to do

217
00:09:46,878 --> 00:09:47,859
to address that big risk.

218
00:09:50,407 --> 00:09:51,367
This is an interesting one.

219
00:09:51,387 --> 00:09:52,908
Number 10, your proof of concept

220
00:09:52,988 --> 00:09:54,289
doesn't prove your concept.

221
00:09:55,249 --> 00:09:56,710
A lot of times people do prototypes,

222
00:09:56,730 --> 00:09:59,191
and you'll see prototypes when you're getting pitched.

223
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:02,673
And you need to be very careful what you're prototyping,

224
00:10:02,693 --> 00:10:04,974
because a lot of times what you prototype is the easy stuff,

225
00:10:05,034 --> 00:10:06,415
and the easy stuff is not the stuff

226
00:10:06,435 --> 00:10:07,435
that needs to be prototyped.

227
00:10:07,935 --> 00:10:09,336
So if you show me a prototype and you're like,

228
00:10:09,396 --> 00:10:11,177
hey, here's a character that's walking around.

229
00:10:11,757 --> 00:10:13,718
I'm like, that doesn't tell me anything.

230
00:10:13,858 --> 00:10:15,599
It's very easy to get a prototype working

231
00:10:15,699 --> 00:10:17,540
where a character is walking around.

232
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,885
If you're going to prototype, it is important to try to focus on the things that are unique

233
00:10:22,945 --> 00:10:23,925
and different and hard.

234
00:10:24,426 --> 00:10:28,469
Show what it is that if you have a unique combat mechanic, that's what I want to see

235
00:10:28,489 --> 00:10:29,150
in prototype.

236
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,234
I don't want to see, oh, hey, the character can open doors, because I know you're going

237
00:10:33,254 --> 00:10:34,875
to be able to execute on the character opening doors.

238
00:10:35,902 --> 00:10:41,064
So when you think about prototyping or doing proof of concepts, prototype what will showcase

239
00:10:41,104 --> 00:10:45,126
the hook of your game and things that may convince the person that you're pitching to

240
00:10:45,466 --> 00:10:49,549
that you're able to mitigate the risks that are inherent in what you're proposing.

241
00:10:52,878 --> 00:10:57,043
Number 11, having lots and lots of shitty art does not make your art less shitty.

242
00:10:58,785 --> 00:11:03,050
If you have, if you don't have an artist on staff, if you don't have somebody who can

243
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:06,855
produce high quality images, then try to pay to have just one or two.

244
00:11:07,636 --> 00:11:08,997
You don't need to have a lot of art

245
00:11:09,037 --> 00:11:10,258
to sell the vision of your game.

246
00:11:10,398 --> 00:11:13,360
Often, you can sell the look of a game

247
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,642
with a single really good image.

248
00:11:16,122 --> 00:11:19,125
And you're much better off spending the money or the time,

249
00:11:19,165 --> 00:11:22,387
if you're the artist, to produce that one really stellar image

250
00:11:22,427 --> 00:11:24,108
that sells the look and tone of the game

251
00:11:24,489 --> 00:11:26,690
than to cram your presentation with a lot of stuff that's

252
00:11:26,730 --> 00:11:27,891
really mediocre.

253
00:11:28,572 --> 00:11:30,133
So yeah, one or two amazing pieces

254
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,175
is better than a dozen mediocre ones.

255
00:11:32,215 --> 00:11:33,315
Don't call it in the trap of trying

256
00:11:33,335 --> 00:11:35,257
to think that more art is better if that's not something

257
00:11:35,277 --> 00:11:36,298
you can easily execute on.

258
00:11:38,255 --> 00:11:43,238
And related to that, make sure that I can tell what's placeholder and what's not.

259
00:11:43,739 --> 00:11:49,443
One of the worst things you can do is put stuff in your presentation that is just good

260
00:11:49,503 --> 00:11:54,907
enough that I might think that you intended it to be in the final game, but it's really

261
00:11:54,967 --> 00:11:55,167
not.

262
00:11:55,868 --> 00:12:00,331
So, if the person who put this image on the internet is around, thank you for letting

263
00:12:00,351 --> 00:12:01,692
me use your image because it was...

264
00:12:03,493 --> 00:12:06,457
It was them showing how they actually would showcase

265
00:12:06,497 --> 00:12:08,440
just pure mechanics with pure engineering art.

266
00:12:08,841 --> 00:12:11,404
Engineering art is great because there's no way

267
00:12:11,424 --> 00:12:12,986
the person you're pitching to can mistake that

268
00:12:13,026 --> 00:12:14,288
for what's really going to be in the game.

269
00:12:15,350 --> 00:12:18,414
So an obvious placeholder is better than bad art

270
00:12:18,434 --> 00:12:19,255
that looks like it's final.

271
00:12:21,542 --> 00:12:23,965
Number 13, this is a weird one, because this kind of goes

272
00:12:24,005 --> 00:12:26,188
against the rule of not having crappy stuff that you can be

273
00:12:26,208 --> 00:12:26,608
pitched with.

274
00:12:27,730 --> 00:12:28,771
You polish too early.

275
00:12:29,371 --> 00:12:31,194
And part of the reason this image is in here, this is from

276
00:12:31,234 --> 00:12:34,538
a game I worked on where we did final art for all the

277
00:12:34,578 --> 00:12:36,320
ships before we had our combat model down.

278
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,062
And all the stuff got thrown out.

279
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,925
And so if a game is really, really visually polished,

280
00:12:42,965 --> 00:12:45,527
but the mechanics are still really broken in prototype,

281
00:12:46,067 --> 00:12:47,288
that also is an alarm bell.

282
00:12:47,708 --> 00:12:50,010
Because it suggests that the team is not putting

283
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:51,851
all the effort where it should be.

284
00:12:51,891 --> 00:12:54,173
And it also suggests that a lot of work

285
00:12:54,233 --> 00:12:54,973
is gonna be redone.

286
00:12:55,534 --> 00:12:58,816
So again, if you want to showcase what you're capable of

287
00:12:59,536 --> 00:13:00,957
in the art department, that's great.

288
00:13:01,378 --> 00:13:03,519
But make sure that it doesn't overshadow the fact

289
00:13:03,539 --> 00:13:05,360
that your game in the prototype phase

290
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:07,402
may still be really, really incomplete.

291
00:13:07,962 --> 00:13:10,524
A few still images of showing what your art team is capable of

292
00:13:10,604 --> 00:13:11,885
is much better than a prototype

293
00:13:12,265 --> 00:13:14,027
that is broken in a variety of ways,

294
00:13:14,047 --> 00:13:15,488
but that looks amazing,

295
00:13:15,808 --> 00:13:17,329
because the person you're pitching to knows

296
00:13:17,369 --> 00:13:18,690
that's all going to have to be thrown out

297
00:13:18,730 --> 00:13:20,031
when the game actually gets nailed down.

298
00:13:20,811 --> 00:13:22,012
So make sure that work in progress

299
00:13:22,132 --> 00:13:23,633
actually looks like work in progress.

300
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:30,702
I find this one particularly painful, because part of what I do as a designer is write.

301
00:13:32,344 --> 00:13:33,585
Your sample dialogue sucks.

302
00:13:34,546 --> 00:13:38,769
And this is a problem particularly if you're trying to pitch a game as having a strong

303
00:13:38,809 --> 00:13:39,149
story.

304
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,972
If you're trying to pitch a game that has a strong story, then part of what I will be

305
00:13:43,012 --> 00:13:45,615
judging you on is whether or not you can actually write.

306
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:51,940
And so showcasing a dialogue system that has a bunch of really kind of crappy placeholder

307
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:53,881
dialogue does you no favors.

308
00:13:54,222 --> 00:13:57,243
You're much better off not showcasing the dialogue system

309
00:13:57,263 --> 00:13:59,985
and instead just showing really good dialogue.

310
00:14:00,085 --> 00:14:02,426
Show off that you can actually write something.

311
00:14:02,486 --> 00:14:05,568
Not the generic, hey, do you have a quest for me?

312
00:14:05,928 --> 00:14:09,150
But showcase a dramatic scene where you can actually judge

313
00:14:09,190 --> 00:14:10,931
the quality of the story you're able to deliver.

314
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:15,294
So if you're selling the story, do your presentation

315
00:14:15,334 --> 00:14:17,635
in a way that convinces me that you're actually capable

316
00:14:17,655 --> 00:14:18,916
of executing on what you're selling.

317
00:14:20,707 --> 00:14:22,048
This is a bigger deal last year.

318
00:14:22,368 --> 00:14:24,109
You're pandering to the latest tech craze.

319
00:14:26,430 --> 00:14:29,791
Does this game really need the tech that you're using?

320
00:14:29,831 --> 00:14:31,132
Does it need virtual reality?

321
00:14:31,172 --> 00:14:32,873
Does it need augmented reality?

322
00:14:33,593 --> 00:14:34,553
Back when the move was a thing,

323
00:14:34,574 --> 00:14:36,154
we saw lots of pitches for move games

324
00:14:36,174 --> 00:14:37,775
where the move made no sense at all.

325
00:14:39,296 --> 00:14:40,976
If you want to make a game for these platforms,

326
00:14:41,096 --> 00:14:44,098
make sure that what you're doing with the new technology,

327
00:14:44,118 --> 00:14:45,498
with whatever the new hotness is,

328
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:48,440
actually makes sense in the context of the game.

329
00:14:49,721 --> 00:14:54,007
pitch a game where it feels like you've had an existing game on the shelf and you've retrofitted

330
00:14:54,087 --> 00:15:00,296
some new tech idea because you think that'll help you get interest because in all likelihood

331
00:15:00,336 --> 00:15:01,097
that will actually fail.

332
00:15:03,806 --> 00:15:06,427
Number 16, this happened more often than you would think.

333
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:09,489
I was with Sony, and you just pitched a phone game

334
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:10,589
to a console publisher.

335
00:15:11,470 --> 00:15:14,431
And about 10 minutes in, the response would be,

336
00:15:14,632 --> 00:15:15,532
why are we even talking?

337
00:15:15,572 --> 00:15:16,773
Why are you wasting your time?

338
00:15:17,093 --> 00:15:18,494
Why am I wasting my time?

339
00:15:19,334 --> 00:15:21,215
Do preliminary research to the people

340
00:15:21,235 --> 00:15:22,356
who you're pitching to.

341
00:15:23,136 --> 00:15:26,077
Some publishers have a particular kind of game

342
00:15:26,618 --> 00:15:27,658
that they are interested in.

343
00:15:27,678 --> 00:15:29,099
They're interested in horror games,

344
00:15:29,259 --> 00:15:30,120
or they're interested in

345
00:15:32,601 --> 00:15:35,383
like 8-bit games or they're interested in arty games.

346
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:37,164
There's a whole, and some people,

347
00:15:37,405 --> 00:15:39,346
some publishers are also interested in having

348
00:15:39,786 --> 00:15:41,388
a broad spread of different titles.

349
00:15:41,688 --> 00:15:43,169
So if they're already doing a horror game,

350
00:15:43,189 --> 00:15:44,850
they're probably not interested in your game.

351
00:15:45,210 --> 00:15:47,012
So do some preliminary research to find out

352
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:48,673
what it is that people are interested in

353
00:15:48,713 --> 00:15:51,195
so you don't wind up pitching them something

354
00:15:51,215 --> 00:15:53,256
for the wrong platform, the wrong genre,

355
00:15:53,597 --> 00:15:54,938
something that already goes against

356
00:15:54,958 --> 00:15:55,898
something that they've announced.

357
00:16:00,104 --> 00:16:01,727
Gone Home already exists.

358
00:16:02,809 --> 00:16:04,311
And this is from a couple of years ago,

359
00:16:04,331 --> 00:16:06,074
right after Gone Home came out,

360
00:16:06,094 --> 00:16:07,957
it seemed like every other pitch we got was going to be,

361
00:16:08,398 --> 00:16:10,281
hey, we're gonna do a new version of Gone Home,

362
00:16:11,042 --> 00:16:12,925
without any way to distinguish what it was

363
00:16:12,986 --> 00:16:14,408
that was at all different about it.

364
00:16:14,909 --> 00:16:19,413
So, again, along with the idea that there's being technological hotness that people are

365
00:16:19,433 --> 00:16:21,716
chasing after, there are also hot games that come out.

366
00:16:22,737 --> 00:16:24,839
So in addition to Gone Home existing, so does Minecraft.

367
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:29,184
If you pitch a Minecraft clone, okay, how is this different from Minecraft?

368
00:16:31,045 --> 00:16:34,628
How are you taking something that already exists and moving it in a different direction?

369
00:16:35,049 --> 00:16:39,733
Because if you just say you're going to remake your version of something that's already successful,

370
00:16:40,253 --> 00:16:44,497
then the immediate answer is, well, why would somebody buy this instead of what already

371
00:16:44,577 --> 00:16:45,017
exists?

372
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:50,382
It's already putting you behind in terms of convincing people that your game is worthwhile

373
00:16:50,422 --> 00:16:50,722
to make.

374
00:16:53,767 --> 00:16:56,870
This also ‑‑ it wasn't Marvel, it was a completely different license, but somebody

375
00:16:56,910 --> 00:17:00,934
actually came to us and they had this whole game pitch based around an intellectual property

376
00:17:00,954 --> 00:17:04,177
that they didn't own. And at the end of the pitch, we're like, well, this is actually

377
00:17:04,197 --> 00:17:08,161
pretty cool. And then they said, can you help us negotiate the license to get this intellectual

378
00:17:08,201 --> 00:17:14,847
property? And the answer almost always is no. We cannot help you negotiate your license

379
00:17:14,867 --> 00:17:15,288
to get your IP.

380
00:17:17,877 --> 00:17:19,898
If you want to build a game around an intellectual property,

381
00:17:19,918 --> 00:17:23,500
those negotiations should happen in advance before you

382
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:24,361
go to a publisher.

383
00:17:25,902 --> 00:17:29,544
If you have a publisher who already has access to some IP,

384
00:17:29,564 --> 00:17:32,246
they may be interested in hiring a developer who will

385
00:17:32,626 --> 00:17:34,307
build a game around those.

386
00:17:34,707 --> 00:17:36,929
But asking a publisher to help you get an IP that you've

387
00:17:36,949 --> 00:17:39,590
already built a concept around is a really, really

388
00:17:39,630 --> 00:17:40,411
dangerous thing to do.

389
00:17:43,338 --> 00:17:47,402
This was big when free-to-play was the big new thing.

390
00:17:48,003 --> 00:17:50,205
We would get pitches that consisted almost entirely of

391
00:17:50,245 --> 00:17:52,567
somebody describing their new monetization plan.

392
00:17:53,568 --> 00:17:56,071
And again, nobody buys a game for a monetization plan.

393
00:17:56,431 --> 00:17:58,954
The details of the monetization plan may be really interesting

394
00:17:58,994 --> 00:17:59,995
once you get into development.

395
00:18:00,115 --> 00:18:02,297
If somebody is interested in your pitch, they may say,

396
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:03,899
hey, this is really, really cool.

397
00:18:03,999 --> 00:18:05,941
Can you tell us more about how you're going to make money off of it?

398
00:18:06,422 --> 00:18:09,323
But going into what your pricing tiers are, if you have

399
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:11,564
some unique way that you're going to sell in-game goods,

400
00:18:12,325 --> 00:18:15,566
that's a relatively minor part of selling somebody on the idea

401
00:18:15,606 --> 00:18:16,107
of your game.

402
00:18:16,467 --> 00:18:18,908
And a lot of that will fluctuate during development.

403
00:18:19,248 --> 00:18:20,969
It's worthwhile to say up front, oh, yeah, we're

404
00:18:20,989 --> 00:18:21,930
planning on free-to-play.

405
00:18:21,950 --> 00:18:23,390
We're planning on in-app purchases.

406
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:27,292
A basic idea of what the monetization plan is going to

407
00:18:27,332 --> 00:18:28,413
be affects how you...

408
00:18:29,713 --> 00:18:31,134
You think if the game is feasible or not,

409
00:18:31,574 --> 00:18:34,435
but actually going into detail of how the system is going

410
00:18:34,455 --> 00:18:36,256
to work usually doesn't belong in a pitch.

411
00:18:38,097 --> 00:18:39,997
So make the game, then figure out

412
00:18:40,017 --> 00:18:41,078
what your pricing tiers are.

413
00:18:41,498 --> 00:18:42,698
Don't start from the principle that you're

414
00:18:42,758 --> 00:18:45,199
going to build out your whole monetization plan in advance.

415
00:18:47,380 --> 00:18:48,180
This is a huge one.

416
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,661
You have no idea how much money you need to make this thing.

417
00:18:52,815 --> 00:18:54,717
or this is the same thing, or how many people,

418
00:18:54,977 --> 00:18:58,080
or how much time, never go into pitch

419
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,021
without an idea of what your scope is going to be.

420
00:19:00,942 --> 00:19:02,243
A common question you'll be asked is,

421
00:19:02,303 --> 00:19:04,164
how many hours of gameplay does this have?

422
00:19:04,745 --> 00:19:05,405
How many levels?

423
00:19:05,706 --> 00:19:06,887
How many lines of dialogue?

424
00:19:07,547 --> 00:19:08,648
Whenever I was taking pitches,

425
00:19:08,668 --> 00:19:11,510
I always had a, was running a calculation in my head

426
00:19:11,911 --> 00:19:14,212
of how much money this game is gonna cost to make.

427
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:17,295
And because that's where all the feasibility comes down to.

428
00:19:17,315 --> 00:19:18,756
It's like, can we afford to pay money

429
00:19:18,856 --> 00:19:21,418
to actually pay for this thing?

430
00:19:22,399 --> 00:19:24,741
And if you have no idea how big your game is,

431
00:19:25,061 --> 00:19:27,163
or how many people it's going to take to make,

432
00:19:27,223 --> 00:19:28,504
how many months you're going to run,

433
00:19:28,524 --> 00:19:31,646
it makes it impossible to assess the feasibility

434
00:19:31,726 --> 00:19:33,407
of this game as a project.

435
00:19:33,708 --> 00:19:35,029
You could have a pitch that a game

436
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,490
that's really, really, really amazing,

437
00:19:36,950 --> 00:19:39,592
but if you don't know what it actually takes to build it,

438
00:19:39,952 --> 00:19:41,333
that suggests that you're never going to be able

439
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:41,994
to execute on it.

440
00:19:44,278 --> 00:19:47,019
Related to this is that you come in and you don't have a team.

441
00:19:47,739 --> 00:19:50,760
You don't have anybody besides yourself.

442
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,241
You don't need to have your complete team in place.

443
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:55,301
A lot of times when you're pitching,

444
00:19:55,341 --> 00:19:57,602
it's because you want the money to be able to hire people.

445
00:19:58,042 --> 00:20:00,103
But you at least need to have a roadmap for how

446
00:20:00,143 --> 00:20:01,183
you are going to hire people.

447
00:20:01,863 --> 00:20:04,684
And at least have an idea of who the leads are going to be.

448
00:20:04,724 --> 00:20:07,245
You know, if you have one or two people

449
00:20:07,285 --> 00:20:08,765
who you would like to hire,

450
00:20:10,906 --> 00:20:13,286
you want to give the person that you're pitching to

451
00:20:13,306 --> 00:20:16,007
the idea that there is actually going to be

452
00:20:16,067 --> 00:20:18,808
a body of people who are capable of executing on this idea

453
00:20:19,208 --> 00:20:22,909
and not simply it's a pipe dream that you have,

454
00:20:22,949 --> 00:20:24,669
that you're hoping to make

455
00:20:24,709 --> 00:20:26,750
without any resources to execute on it.

456
00:20:28,740 --> 00:20:31,222
When you're specifying what sort of stuff it is that you,

457
00:20:31,922 --> 00:20:34,764
how much you need and how this game is going to have a

458
00:20:34,824 --> 00:20:37,506
roadmap to success, make sure your business plan that you're

459
00:20:37,526 --> 00:20:38,406
presenting is realistic.

460
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:42,428
If you're saying that you're going to sell as much as World

461
00:20:42,469 --> 00:20:42,989
of Warcraft.

462
00:20:44,230 --> 00:20:46,191
that's not going to happen. Your game is going to fail.

463
00:20:46,691 --> 00:20:49,714
And so if you need to have those sort of sales for your game to make financial sense,

464
00:20:50,294 --> 00:20:52,375
then your business plan makes no sense.

465
00:20:53,096 --> 00:20:55,338
So when you're putting together what your business plan is,

466
00:20:55,398 --> 00:20:56,859
make sure that it's not based on outliers.

467
00:20:56,899 --> 00:20:59,240
If you're saying, hey, here's the scope of our game,

468
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:01,162
here's how much money we expect to make,

469
00:21:01,982 --> 00:21:04,504
pick a middle-of-the-road title, one that's like a moderate success.

470
00:21:04,624 --> 00:21:07,945
Whenever he assumes the game is probably going to succeed a little, people tend to go into

471
00:21:07,965 --> 00:21:13,827
these things with a sense of optimism, but don't have a business plan that's based upon

472
00:21:14,227 --> 00:21:17,108
some sort of wildly unrealistic outrageous sense of success.

473
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:20,048
Here's another one.

474
00:21:20,608 --> 00:21:22,889
You seem like you'd be a huge pain in the ass to work with.

475
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:29,751
I actually sat in pitches where afterwards we would sit and talk and say, man, that was

476
00:21:29,791 --> 00:21:30,851
a really great game idea.

477
00:21:32,170 --> 00:21:33,331
That guy was a huge asshole.

478
00:21:35,151 --> 00:21:36,631
And this is more important than you think,

479
00:21:36,691 --> 00:21:41,873
because a publisher-developer relationship

480
00:21:42,013 --> 00:21:42,853
is a relationship.

481
00:21:42,893 --> 00:21:43,453
It's ongoing.

482
00:21:43,493 --> 00:21:45,414
At a minimum, you're going to be working together

483
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:46,074
for six months.

484
00:21:46,614 --> 00:21:49,054
Quite often, it can be 18 months, two years,

485
00:21:49,134 --> 00:21:50,355
three years if things go wrong.

486
00:21:50,855 --> 00:21:51,855
Things get stressful.

487
00:21:51,895 --> 00:21:53,235
There's a lot of money involved.

488
00:21:53,295 --> 00:21:53,956
People get nervous.

489
00:21:54,376 --> 00:21:56,936
If you're not able to be friendly and agreeable

490
00:21:56,996 --> 00:21:57,656
in a pitch meeting,

491
00:21:58,257 --> 00:22:02,179
What are you going to be like when you're sleep deprived and you're a week out from

492
00:22:02,319 --> 00:22:03,379
alpha and nothing works?

493
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:07,942
So remember that your pitch is also an addition.

494
00:22:07,962 --> 00:22:13,584
It is making you, you're showing to the person you're pitching to what sort of person you're

495
00:22:13,604 --> 00:22:14,525
going to be like to work with.

496
00:22:14,965 --> 00:22:17,466
Are you going to be a colleague that they actually want to be involved with?

497
00:22:20,094 --> 00:22:22,675
Number 24, you expect me to know off the bat who you are.

498
00:22:23,556 --> 00:22:24,536
There are a lot of games out there,

499
00:22:24,556 --> 00:22:25,677
and a lot of game developers.

500
00:22:26,557 --> 00:22:28,998
And I may not have played your previous games.

501
00:22:29,318 --> 00:22:30,839
Start off giving me a little bit of background.

502
00:22:31,379 --> 00:22:33,660
Tell me what you've worked on before.

503
00:22:34,981 --> 00:22:36,962
Don't assume, and don't be offended in particular

504
00:22:37,002 --> 00:22:38,303
if I haven't played your game before,

505
00:22:38,423 --> 00:22:39,743
even if it was well received.

506
00:22:39,783 --> 00:22:40,944
There's a lot of stuff out there.

507
00:22:42,556 --> 00:22:46,219
Number 25, you get annoyed if I ask you questions.

508
00:22:47,341 --> 00:22:51,204
And this is hard sometimes because if you've pitched and

509
00:22:51,224 --> 00:22:52,946
you've rehearsed your pitch really well and you know

510
00:22:52,986 --> 00:22:54,668
exactly what you're going to say and you have your whole

511
00:22:54,688 --> 00:22:58,751
thing scripted and down, and then somebody like five

512
00:22:58,771 --> 00:23:00,853
minutes in raises their hand and asks you a question you're

513
00:23:00,873 --> 00:23:03,436
going to answer later on, it's really, really annoying.

514
00:23:04,197 --> 00:23:04,377
But.

515
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,643
If somebody's asking you questions while you're pitching,

516
00:23:07,663 --> 00:23:09,184
it means they're interested in your game.

517
00:23:09,424 --> 00:23:10,786
And it means that they want to know more.

518
00:23:10,826 --> 00:23:14,690
And so try to roll with the flow of how the pitch goes.

519
00:23:15,370 --> 00:23:17,132
If it takes you off script, go off script.

520
00:23:18,874 --> 00:23:21,256
You're not being judged on how well you stick to script.

521
00:23:21,656 --> 00:23:22,938
It's how well you convey

522
00:23:23,238 --> 00:23:24,619
what needs to be conveyed for the game.

523
00:23:26,998 --> 00:23:27,778
This is a weird one.

524
00:23:27,838 --> 00:23:29,159
We're watching the pitch on your phone.

525
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,921
It's really hard to look at a PowerPoint

526
00:23:33,001 --> 00:23:34,341
if it's like this big.

527
00:23:35,242 --> 00:23:38,183
And so, be sure you have the adequate technology

528
00:23:38,223 --> 00:23:39,063
to pitch what you're pitching.

529
00:23:39,824 --> 00:23:41,384
Even if you're pitching a phone game,

530
00:23:41,885 --> 00:23:44,506
it is often worthwhile to show stuff on a tablet

531
00:23:44,546 --> 00:23:45,766
to the person you're pitching to.

532
00:23:46,407 --> 00:23:51,649
So please, bring a tablet or a laptop to your pitch.

533
00:23:55,487 --> 00:23:57,548
Number 27, you bought a laptop, but you

534
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:58,629
didn't bring headphones.

535
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:02,071
I was talking to somebody.

536
00:24:02,111 --> 00:24:03,612
I no longer take pitches because I'm freelance.

537
00:24:03,652 --> 00:24:05,833
But somebody showed me their game a couple of days ago.

538
00:24:05,893 --> 00:24:07,795
And I thanked him because we were in a really noisy place,

539
00:24:07,835 --> 00:24:09,876
and he had headphones.

540
00:24:10,036 --> 00:24:11,677
Sound is at all important to your game.

541
00:24:11,697 --> 00:24:15,080
If it means anything, assume you're going to be pitching in

542
00:24:15,220 --> 00:24:16,921
the noisiest bar at GDC.

543
00:24:17,061 --> 00:24:18,582
Because a lot of times, that's what happens.

544
00:24:19,302 --> 00:24:21,184
And actually, please bring headphones.

545
00:24:21,264 --> 00:24:23,945
Because if you hand me your earbuds, I don't want to put

546
00:24:23,965 --> 00:24:24,546
them in my ears.

547
00:24:29,054 --> 00:24:31,035
Number 28, this only happened once.

548
00:24:33,256 --> 00:24:35,678
You show up hungover or drunk or high.

549
00:24:36,438 --> 00:24:37,199
Please don't do this.

550
00:24:39,040 --> 00:24:40,641
Hungover is probably the most common one,

551
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:43,042
but I've seen the others.

552
00:24:44,563 --> 00:24:47,704
And it really, my immediate response

553
00:24:47,804 --> 00:24:49,766
is, if you're not taking this seriously,

554
00:24:50,006 --> 00:24:51,446
then why am I taking this?

555
00:24:52,647 --> 00:24:57,752
And it also suggests that if you're not able to pull it together for a half-hour pitch,

556
00:24:58,472 --> 00:25:03,056
what is it going to be like over the entire development?

557
00:25:03,536 --> 00:25:06,098
I've gotten the five-minute warning, but fortunately I only have two more.

558
00:25:08,052 --> 00:25:09,313
Don't trash other companies.

559
00:25:10,373 --> 00:25:12,674
People will say, oh yeah, our last publisher

560
00:25:12,694 --> 00:25:14,936
was really awful, or we really hated him,

561
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:16,876
or we don't want to make a game like this other game

562
00:25:16,896 --> 00:25:19,398
because it's crap, or don't do this.

563
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:20,438
Don't trash other people.

564
00:25:20,458 --> 00:25:22,739
There's ways to talk about why your game is great,

565
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:25,781
or why you're a great team without talking

566
00:25:25,861 --> 00:25:28,262
about negative things about other people in the industry.

567
00:25:29,082 --> 00:25:31,785
Because again, development relationships

568
00:25:31,805 --> 00:25:32,886
are always very stressful,

569
00:25:33,286 --> 00:25:36,529
and what will run through the publisher's mind is,

570
00:25:36,949 --> 00:25:38,070
how are they going to talk about us

571
00:25:38,591 --> 00:25:40,392
when they're making a game for us?

572
00:25:41,693 --> 00:25:43,675
And finally, make sure you take a shower.

573
00:25:45,617 --> 00:25:47,098
I shouldn't have to tell people this,

574
00:25:47,198 --> 00:25:48,319
and I know it's hard at GDC.

575
00:25:48,339 --> 00:25:49,640
You're walking around a lot,

576
00:25:50,321 --> 00:25:53,604
but I've tried not to hold it against people,

577
00:25:53,964 --> 00:25:54,184
but...

578
00:25:55,744 --> 00:25:56,004
Yeah.

579
00:25:57,406 --> 00:26:00,710
And this goes into the, if you're doing a VR demonstration,

580
00:26:00,791 --> 00:26:03,234
please wipe off the face plate before you give it

581
00:26:03,254 --> 00:26:04,395
to me to put on.

582
00:26:04,415 --> 00:26:05,637
Or don't give me your earbuds.

583
00:26:06,077 --> 00:26:08,520
Be mindful of the fact that we're talking and interacting

584
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:09,281
with a lot of people.

585
00:26:09,482 --> 00:26:11,664
And it's a small thing, but it goes a long way

586
00:26:11,684 --> 00:26:14,047
to feeling like you respect the person you're pitching to.

587
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,433
So just a couple of positive things at the end,

588
00:26:17,453 --> 00:26:18,795
because that was a whole lot of negativity.

589
00:26:19,776 --> 00:26:20,617
Be enthusiastic.

590
00:26:20,737 --> 00:26:21,759
Be excited about your game.

591
00:26:21,779 --> 00:26:23,822
You're the person who's the most excited about your game.

592
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:25,384
And if you're not excited about your game,

593
00:26:25,724 --> 00:26:27,146
then who is going to be?

594
00:26:27,306 --> 00:26:28,808
Show that enthusiasm while you're pitching.

595
00:26:29,369 --> 00:26:30,250
Be upfront and honest.

596
00:26:30,290 --> 00:26:31,292
If you're an inexperienced team.

597
00:26:32,333 --> 00:26:33,394
Be sure to say that.

598
00:26:33,474 --> 00:26:36,675
You're not going to be able to fool most people you're pitching to.

599
00:26:36,695 --> 00:26:37,596
You're not going to be able to snow them.

600
00:26:37,616 --> 00:26:40,497
They've seen things many, many times.

601
00:26:41,258 --> 00:26:43,079
Be up front with what's hard about your development.

602
00:26:43,139 --> 00:26:46,741
Be up front about what your challenges are, what your risks are.

603
00:26:47,161 --> 00:26:48,982
That makes it seem like you know what you're doing

604
00:26:49,022 --> 00:26:51,103
when you're up front about the problems you face.

605
00:26:51,744 --> 00:26:53,344
Sell your hook really, really hard.

606
00:26:53,544 --> 00:26:56,126
What is it about your game that makes it original and unique

607
00:26:56,166 --> 00:26:56,626
and different?

608
00:26:56,666 --> 00:26:58,347
Because that's the thing that will make it sell.

609
00:26:58,887 --> 00:27:01,208
And above all, know your scope backwards and forwards.

610
00:27:01,288 --> 00:27:03,450
Know how much it's going to cost, how many levels,

611
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:06,351
how many hours, how many characters, how much dialogue.

612
00:27:06,671 --> 00:27:08,792
You don't need to have created all these things.

613
00:27:09,072 --> 00:27:11,374
You need to know how many of each one of these things

614
00:27:11,734 --> 00:27:13,755
you're planning to have in your finished game.

615
00:27:15,776 --> 00:27:16,596
And I have like three minutes.

616
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,297
So thank you very much.

617
00:27:25,455 --> 00:27:25,935
This is me.

618
00:27:26,495 --> 00:27:27,656
As I said, I'm no longer with Sony.

619
00:27:27,856 --> 00:27:31,317
I left Sony this past fall to go freelance as a design consultant.

620
00:27:32,057 --> 00:27:33,997
My website is gameontherails.com.

621
00:27:34,057 --> 00:27:38,759
You can follow me on Twitter at BBEpton, or you can just e-mail me if you have questions.

622
00:27:39,319 --> 00:27:43,980
And I think we probably have time for, like, two or three questions, if anybody has any.

623
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:47,061
And they've asked me to ask people to come to the microphones, please,

624
00:27:47,681 --> 00:27:49,742
and please speak into the microphones because it's being recorded.

625
00:27:52,104 --> 00:27:56,087
Could you talk a little bit about time, about how much time people would budget for a pitch?

626
00:27:57,008 --> 00:27:59,150
Typically, when we were doing pitches, half an hour.

627
00:27:59,690 --> 00:28:04,475
Again, it depends. If we were doing a pitch at GDC, we'd assume it would be half an hour.

628
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:07,978
If we were going on site, which would happen sometimes, that's going to be longer.

629
00:28:08,378 --> 00:28:13,182
We might spend an hour or two hours, but usually if you do a site visit, then you're actually

630
00:28:13,222 --> 00:28:17,265
digging into what sort of tools are they using.

631
00:28:17,805 --> 00:28:21,148
The pitch itself might still only take half an hour, but then there'd be all sorts of

632
00:28:21,188 --> 00:28:21,968
follow-up questions.

633
00:28:22,509 --> 00:28:28,933
So in general, have something, your high-level elevator pitch, but if you're doing a PowerPoint

634
00:28:28,973 --> 00:28:30,434
presentation, 30 minutes is good.

635
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:40,084
Hi, I'm from Lebanon and the Arab world in general is a publisher-light, investor-heavy industry.

636
00:28:40,784 --> 00:28:44,347
So we tend to be pitching studios more than we do individual games.

637
00:28:45,728 --> 00:28:48,930
What approach, what advice can you give in terms of that?

638
00:28:48,970 --> 00:28:51,491
I know it's not something you have experience with necessarily.

639
00:28:52,158 --> 00:28:56,920
Yeah, so if I understand your question, it's like, how do you pitch to investors as opposed to publishers? Is that correct?

640
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,361
Studios rather than games.

641
00:28:58,681 --> 00:29:00,621
Oh, studios rather than games.

642
00:29:01,021 --> 00:29:11,025
So, in general, I have a longer version of this talk that's an hour and I can't fit everything in, but if you can gauge who's in the room right at the very beginning...

643
00:29:12,485 --> 00:29:14,386
If you have senior management, then you

644
00:29:14,426 --> 00:29:17,127
want to talk about high-level vision and capabilities

645
00:29:17,167 --> 00:29:17,587
of the team.

646
00:29:18,107 --> 00:29:20,087
So this is the grand thing we want to build,

647
00:29:20,247 --> 00:29:24,328
and this is why we're great and why we can execute on it.

648
00:29:24,809 --> 00:29:26,489
If you are talking to people who are,

649
00:29:26,769 --> 00:29:29,270
if you have a designer in the room or an engineer

650
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:31,430
or an artist, my job is to go along as the designer

651
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:32,271
and evaluate the design.

652
00:29:32,791 --> 00:29:36,032
Then that's why you go lower and more into the nitty gritty.

653
00:29:36,432 --> 00:29:38,772
So what I'm saying, for your case,

654
00:29:38,792 --> 00:29:40,753
where you're pitching the studio.

655
00:29:41,193 --> 00:29:43,235
What you really want to be doing is pitching the capabilities.

656
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,918
So you want to be saying, here's the people we have.

657
00:29:47,378 --> 00:29:50,400
Here are what they're able to do.

658
00:29:50,481 --> 00:29:51,521
If they've worked on other games,

659
00:29:51,561 --> 00:29:52,883
these are the other games they've worked on.

660
00:29:53,403 --> 00:29:55,665
And then talk about your creative vision,

661
00:29:55,705 --> 00:29:57,907
your high level, this is the grand thing

662
00:29:57,947 --> 00:29:58,747
we want to accomplish.

663
00:29:58,787 --> 00:30:02,130
Not necessarily with one game, but with multiple games.

664
00:30:02,150 --> 00:30:03,871
This is thematically what we want to do,

665
00:30:04,252 --> 00:30:05,893
or this is in business terms what we want to do.

666
00:30:06,053 --> 00:30:06,794
That's how I'd approach that.

667
00:30:08,434 --> 00:30:15,505
Oh, thank you. Just a quick question. I went to Game Connection America this year and well, even though

668
00:30:16,587 --> 00:30:23,932
according to the 30 dots over there, we pretty much cover everything. But at the same time,

669
00:30:24,092 --> 00:30:30,957
since we don't have any published games, we sort of hit a wall where people were always,

670
00:30:31,057 --> 00:30:36,260
yeah, I cannot finance you because you don't have anything published. So do you have any

671
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:39,202
sort of recommendations for people who are starting from scratch?

672
00:30:43,396 --> 00:30:46,119
The question was how do you get published when you're starting from scratch?

673
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:52,044
The challenge there is that it's on the can this team execute front, because they don't

674
00:30:52,064 --> 00:30:54,286
want to take the risk, because they don't believe that you can pull it off.

675
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:57,288
In that case, a lot of what you may need to do

676
00:30:57,929 --> 00:30:59,490
is put extra effort into your prototype.

677
00:30:59,930 --> 00:31:03,473
And that, unfortunately, means spending more money up front

678
00:31:03,593 --> 00:31:06,034
to show that you're capable of producing something

679
00:31:07,055 --> 00:31:08,116
that's, you know, 30% finished

680
00:31:09,036 --> 00:31:11,398
before you actually go to pitch it.

681
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,460
It's very hard to pitch just a straight-up idea

682
00:31:15,000 --> 00:31:17,762
if nobody on your team has a track record of delivering.

683
00:31:18,202 --> 00:31:19,743
The further along you get in your prototype

684
00:31:19,763 --> 00:31:21,344
and the more complete the prototype it is,

685
00:31:21,424 --> 00:31:23,566
the easier it is to sell with an inexperienced team.

686
00:31:24,126 --> 00:31:26,628
That's one reason as an inexperienced team to try to do something really small.

687
00:31:27,068 --> 00:31:31,350
Because then you can sell something that is more nearly complete when you're proposing it to somebody.

688
00:31:31,911 --> 00:31:32,231
Thank you.

689
00:31:33,472 --> 00:31:37,974
You say what you need to do while you're in your pitch, pitching your game,

690
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:47,000
but what's the best way to get a certain company or people to actually be willing to meet with you to pitch your game to them?

691
00:31:49,191 --> 00:31:50,812
Contact them before you come to GDC.

692
00:31:50,832 --> 00:31:51,672
This was a big one.

693
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:59,316
So research companies, a lot of times it's going to be hard to convince them to do any sort of travel

694
00:31:59,396 --> 00:32:02,458
or that you're going to do any sort of travel if you're pitching completely cold.

695
00:32:03,418 --> 00:32:07,100
A lot of times the way pitches would come in to us would be there would be an initial

696
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:12,023
contact point, and because we were a publisher, we would advertise, you know, this is who

697
00:32:12,043 --> 00:32:12,923
you need to contact.

698
00:32:14,104 --> 00:32:19,086
Right to the initial contact point, it explained that you have, that you're a small company,

699
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:23,709
there is a game that you're interested in pitching, and at that point you include basic

700
00:32:23,749 --> 00:32:26,670
information that shows that it's even worthwhile to take the pitch.

701
00:32:27,350 --> 00:32:31,493
At that point, typically what we would get might be one or

702
00:32:31,553 --> 00:32:34,655
two, three pages about what the intended game is.

703
00:32:34,715 --> 00:32:38,118
That's just a very high level concept description.

704
00:32:38,598 --> 00:32:40,919
And then more information on who the team is.

705
00:32:41,020 --> 00:32:43,421
Because again, the two questions are, is this

706
00:32:43,461 --> 00:32:44,062
worthwhile?

707
00:32:46,403 --> 00:32:48,545
Is this team able to execute?

708
00:32:48,885 --> 00:32:52,208
And so setting up front like, hey, I'm teasing you with

709
00:32:52,248 --> 00:32:53,749
something, you think you'd be interested in seeing this?

710
00:32:54,130 --> 00:32:55,731
Look at us, we're actually kind of competent.

711
00:32:55,771 --> 00:32:57,573
You should actually maybe trust us to do this.

712
00:32:58,173 --> 00:33:00,875
That, for us, was enough to at least get us to do a follow-up

713
00:33:00,956 --> 00:33:04,298
email, a little back and forth, and then try to do that

714
00:33:04,519 --> 00:33:06,460
prior to GDC or E3 or.

715
00:33:08,802 --> 00:33:13,524
Try to do it in a way that gives you a quick and easy meeting with somebody without it

716
00:33:13,584 --> 00:33:18,586
turning into travel expenses because nobody is going to pay for travel expenses for anything

717
00:33:18,606 --> 00:33:20,647
that's at the early, early proposal stage.

718
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:28,605
My question is about trailers because I assume you get to see a lot of trailers in Flightliner work.

719
00:33:30,146 --> 00:33:34,150
When you watch trailers, how much patience do you have to watch them?

720
00:33:35,091 --> 00:33:40,056
And what elements are, let's say, more interesting or more relevant to you?

721
00:33:40,076 --> 00:33:43,860
Do you like to see gameplay? Do you like to see a narrated, hard-sale type of trailer?

722
00:33:44,301 --> 00:33:45,182
What's most effective?

723
00:33:46,687 --> 00:33:50,449
If you're pitching to investors or higher level management,

724
00:33:50,549 --> 00:33:52,330
a trailer can be really good for it

725
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:53,490
because it's pretty and shiny.

726
00:33:54,291 --> 00:33:57,452
And it sort of shows off your ability to polish.

727
00:33:57,492 --> 00:33:59,493
If you're pitching to people that

728
00:33:59,533 --> 00:34:02,715
are more down in the trenches, they'll

729
00:34:02,735 --> 00:34:03,575
tend to ignore the trailer.

730
00:34:04,255 --> 00:34:07,097
I was more interested in prototype and in concept art

731
00:34:07,117 --> 00:34:08,838
than a trailer because you can hide

732
00:34:08,898 --> 00:34:10,298
so many things in a trailer.

733
00:34:11,259 --> 00:34:12,419
And so what I would say is that.

734
00:34:15,616 --> 00:34:20,398
Unless a trailer is something you can do very easily based on an existing prototype you have,

735
00:34:20,938 --> 00:34:25,740
an existing art you have, that's probably not the best place to put a lot of effort into your pitch.

736
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:32,063
Because it will sell the game potentially to an inexperienced investor,

737
00:34:32,523 --> 00:34:37,365
but not to somebody who is really going to be digging deep into whether the game is going to be viable or not.

738
00:34:37,966 --> 00:34:38,246
Thank you.

739
00:34:39,786 --> 00:34:43,728
Are there any metrics that you think are important to bring to a pitch if you have them, or any you'd avoid?

740
00:34:45,513 --> 00:34:46,435
What do you mean by metrics?

741
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:50,160
Like daily active users or previous sales on previous games or...

742
00:34:50,300 --> 00:34:50,741
Oh, absolutely.

743
00:34:50,761 --> 00:34:55,707
I mean, if you have a track record, and particularly if you have a track record of success, that

744
00:34:55,767 --> 00:34:58,892
is absolutely something that you should talk about.

745
00:34:59,693 --> 00:35:01,875
As I said, I have a longer version of this talk

746
00:35:01,895 --> 00:35:02,896
that is not entirely negative,

747
00:35:02,936 --> 00:35:05,899
and I talk about how to sell your company,

748
00:35:05,939 --> 00:35:06,540
and one thing is,

749
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:08,582
who are the principal people in your company?

750
00:35:08,622 --> 00:35:09,703
What are their experiences?

751
00:35:09,763 --> 00:35:10,824
What games have you shipped?

752
00:35:10,864 --> 00:35:12,025
If those games have been successful,

753
00:35:12,085 --> 00:35:13,186
how successful were they?

754
00:35:13,606 --> 00:35:14,728
All that stuff is great,

755
00:35:14,828 --> 00:35:17,590
because that really shows that you're able to execute

756
00:35:17,771 --> 00:35:19,152
on what you're proposing.

757
00:35:19,212 --> 00:35:20,874
So yeah, if you have stuff like that,

758
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:23,897
that's perfect information.

759
00:35:24,037 --> 00:35:24,237
Thanks.

760
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:30,627
Sometimes when you have been working on a game for a long time,

761
00:35:30,647 --> 00:35:34,011
it's difficult for you to find back to the hook of the game.

762
00:35:34,071 --> 00:35:37,134
Do you have any tools to like finding back to the hook

763
00:35:37,174 --> 00:35:38,676
and defining the hook for a game?

764
00:35:39,497 --> 00:35:40,758
I'm not sure I understand your question.

765
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,741
The hook of the game.

766
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:43,622
Oh, the hook.

767
00:35:43,662 --> 00:35:44,342
How to find the hook?

768
00:35:45,663 --> 00:35:49,066
Well, that's the $20 million question, isn't it?

769
00:35:49,667 --> 00:35:53,951
Yeah, I mean, so what I tend to do as a designer,

770
00:35:53,991 --> 00:35:56,153
and this is outside pitching and designing,

771
00:35:56,273 --> 00:35:56,533
is that

772
00:35:58,294 --> 00:36:07,236
Take whatever your core game is and then push it off axis a little bit and see where that takes you.

773
00:36:07,856 --> 00:36:10,376
I'll use the first big game I worked on, which is Rainbow Six.

774
00:36:10,857 --> 00:36:17,538
We knew we wanted to do a first-person shooter, but we wanted it to have a slightly different feel.

775
00:36:18,518 --> 00:36:24,060
The hook started out with the idea that what would it be like to play a shooter where twitch reflexes didn't matter,

776
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:27,040
where it was all about patience and tactics.

777
00:36:28,001 --> 00:36:30,002
And that came out almost from the very beginning,

778
00:36:30,042 --> 00:36:31,984
but it was the idea that we took something that was established

779
00:36:32,384 --> 00:36:33,385
and then said, oh, let's just take...

780
00:36:33,805 --> 00:36:35,466
What if we change the rules a little

781
00:36:35,506 --> 00:36:36,907
and push it a little in this direction?

782
00:36:37,287 --> 00:36:38,808
Or push it a little in that direction?

783
00:36:38,828 --> 00:36:40,890
There are a variety of things that can be a hook.

784
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,771
I mean, a mechanic hook is always good.

785
00:36:42,791 --> 00:36:44,952
Sometimes just the look of a game is a hook.

786
00:36:45,673 --> 00:36:47,614
One of the best pitches we ever took at Sony

787
00:36:47,634 --> 00:36:49,075
was for The Unfinished Swan,

788
00:36:49,796 --> 00:36:51,897
and it was so stunning because it had an original mechanic

789
00:36:52,017 --> 00:36:53,458
and an original look at the same time,

790
00:36:53,478 --> 00:36:54,479
which was like two hooks.

791
00:36:54,919 --> 00:36:56,180
and two that were interrelated.

792
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:59,222
And so, if you have a really compelling character,

793
00:36:59,322 --> 00:37:01,984
if you have a really original look,

794
00:37:02,044 --> 00:37:04,346
if you have a original gameplay twist,

795
00:37:04,826 --> 00:37:07,028
but look at ways to take something that already exists

796
00:37:07,228 --> 00:37:08,909
and push it in an unexpected direction

797
00:37:09,129 --> 00:37:11,210
and see where it takes you and iterate on that.

798
00:37:11,351 --> 00:37:13,032
Don't just pick the first one that comes to mind.

799
00:37:13,452 --> 00:37:14,353
Try to find different ways

800
00:37:14,433 --> 00:37:16,894
to push things in different directions.

801
00:37:17,335 --> 00:37:18,075
Thank you. Sure.

802
00:37:18,095 --> 00:37:21,097
Is anybody else?

803
00:37:21,938 --> 00:37:22,618
Okay, perfect.
