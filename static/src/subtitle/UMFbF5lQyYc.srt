1
00:00:03,201 --> 00:00:03,342
so

2
00:00:12,386 --> 00:00:13,026
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:13,066 --> 00:00:13,947
Thank you for coming.

4
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:16,607
I've been told to tell you all to turn your cell phones off.

5
00:00:16,727 --> 00:00:22,229
So you should probably turn your cell phones off, but it's OK if you don't want to as well.

6
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:24,750
My name is Graham Parks.

7
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:29,372
I'm the main writer and one of three creative directors behind this indie game, Before Your Eyes.

8
00:00:29,392 --> 00:00:37,374
It came out two years ago on Mac and PC, released on mobile via Netflix last year, and just about a week ago launched on PlayStation VR 2.

9
00:00:37,675 --> 00:00:41,536
But if you're not familiar with the game, you definitely will be by the end of this, so don't worry.

10
00:00:42,376 --> 00:00:57,004
Um, yeah, in 2014, it was my last year of college, um, and one of my oldest friends from high school, Will Hellworth, who you see right there, uh, called me up and pitched me this crazy idea for a video game he wanted to make for his college thesis project.

11
00:00:57,925 --> 00:01:04,268
And, uh, basically what he had discovered is that with this readily available plugin, even the most basic computer webcam could do eye tracking.

12
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:08,711
And he wanted to design a game around that, specifically around the process of blinking.

13
00:01:11,308 --> 00:01:18,456
He was intrigued by the physical inevitability of that process, that no matter how hard you try to keep your eyes open, you'll ultimately fail.

14
00:01:18,877 --> 00:01:26,626
And he saw this as a metaphor for death, which is something that he'd been wrestling with in his personal life for a variety of reasons.

15
00:01:28,613 --> 00:01:28,673
on

16
00:01:44,526 --> 00:01:53,708
I think his question was, what if we make a game about losing, where you lose, no matter how hard you try, you can't win a staring contest with a web camera.

17
00:01:53,728 --> 00:01:54,708
You're going to have to blink.

18
00:01:54,988 --> 00:02:01,630
And so what if we made a game where you lose over and over and over again, and then you die, and that's the end of the game.

19
00:02:01,930 --> 00:02:06,731
And the game will take place on a character's deathbed, and life is going to flash before your eyes.

20
00:02:06,771 --> 00:02:10,231
And every time you blink, you'll jump forward in time to a different memory of your life.

21
00:02:10,371 --> 00:02:12,092
And Will knew I was a writer.

22
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,773
grew up, but we went to the same high school.

23
00:02:15,193 --> 00:02:20,214
We took the bus together and spent all our time talking about video games, basically.

24
00:02:20,494 --> 00:02:24,235
And he knew I wanted to write games, and so he wanted me to come on and write this game for him.

25
00:02:24,516 --> 00:02:35,599
And I can tell you right now, it was the single greatest call I'd ever received in my life, because this game, this pitch, felt like the culmination of everything I wanted to be a part of creatively.

26
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:45,252
While Will was at USC studying games, I was at NYU studying playwriting, but really spending most of my time watching old movies at the Film Forum, this repertory movie theater where I used to work.

27
00:02:45,990 --> 00:03:12,715
smoking a lot of weed, playing a lot of video games and in my very pretentious NYU film kid way I'd become obsessed with this idea that these filmmakers that I was learning about from the silent era or Alfred Hitchcock or the French New Wave that if they were alive today they'd probably be making video games and not films because you know you watch all these groundbreaking old films that were sort of playing with the form and I wasn't seeing that kind of formal innovation in the current cinema

28
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,376
But where I did find it was in games.

29
00:03:16,616 --> 00:03:23,219
And I don't think it's really discussed enough, but those were some really incredible years for narrative indie games, I think.

30
00:03:23,779 --> 00:03:27,660
It felt like every few months something was coming out that was totally left field and groundbreaking.

31
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:33,122
And being the perfect age in college, it just felt like my mind was constantly being blown.

32
00:03:35,223 --> 00:03:37,864
Here's a few of the classics.

33
00:03:39,485 --> 00:03:41,086
that left a big mark on me.

34
00:03:41,287 --> 00:03:51,116
Yeah, and it felt to me like playing these games must have been what, like, seeing Breathless or watching Psycho or something must have felt like in the 60s, this sort of feeling of, I didn't know this medium could do this.

35
00:03:52,837 --> 00:03:56,741
And that was so core to what, you know, this concept that Will had pitched me.

36
00:03:58,262 --> 00:04:02,386
I had started signing up for classes at the NYU Game Center, which was sort of a new thing at the time.

37
00:04:02,773 --> 00:04:17,976
had a great time in all the theory classes and all that but as soon as I signed up for a intro to unity course I had to drop out because three weeks in I was just too dumb to follow along so this is a GDC talk from somebody who couldn't make it through an intro to unity course

38
00:04:19,722 --> 00:04:24,325
Yeah, I hope it gives some hope to people who maybe are as dumb as I am.

39
00:04:24,865 --> 00:04:28,947
And because of that, I kind of felt like, well, I'll probably never get to work in games.

40
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:36,151
It was this medium I was obsessed with, but it just felt like there wouldn't be a place for me.

41
00:04:36,211 --> 00:04:41,333
So then when I get this call from Will, I just decided I was going to grab onto this thing and never let go.

42
00:04:45,353 --> 00:04:46,994
And at first it went really well.

43
00:04:48,616 --> 00:04:59,645
Will brought in more of our old high school crew, like some of our, all our sort of best friends from high school, Ollie Lewin, who was the composer and became a co-director, Griffin Libby Blesser, who was our art director.

44
00:04:59,685 --> 00:05:03,768
These were like people that I'd known since I was like three and six and twelve.

45
00:05:04,332 --> 00:05:14,785
um, and he brought us all on to kind of bolster out his USC team that were building the actual game and together we created this 15 minute version that we submitted to IndieCade in 2014 and it got in.

46
00:05:15,946 --> 00:05:18,389
Um, and it barely worked.

47
00:05:18,630 --> 00:05:21,273
I mean the BlinkTech really was rough at that time.

48
00:05:21,974 --> 00:05:22,595
Um, but

49
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:28,244
When it did work, we were kind of shocked by people's reactions.

50
00:05:29,885 --> 00:05:34,486
And I'll be honest, the game really wasn't good enough to elicit the reactions it was getting.

51
00:05:34,527 --> 00:05:36,307
I mean, people were leaving the booth crying.

52
00:05:36,928 --> 00:05:40,349
And speaking just for myself, the writing certainly wasn't.

53
00:05:41,409 --> 00:05:47,092
There's a comment that we received on the YouTube upload of it that stays in my memory.

54
00:05:51,497 --> 00:05:51,577
on

55
00:06:07,441 --> 00:06:10,383
in the concept that was just sort of inherently emotional.

56
00:06:10,423 --> 00:06:19,490
By creating this physical connection between you and the game and forcing you to lose this staring contest again and again and again, the game sort of breaks down your defenses.

57
00:06:21,351 --> 00:06:24,453
And you have no choice to get kind of invested.

58
00:06:30,592 --> 00:06:34,858
In 2014, it won the developer's choice at IndieCade, which we were shocked.

59
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,663
And we decided we'd put more work into it.

60
00:06:37,703 --> 00:06:39,245
I wrote a totally new script.

61
00:06:39,625 --> 00:06:43,752
We basically rebuilt it from the ground up into something much better and more polished.

62
00:06:43,792 --> 00:06:44,312
It still was

63
00:06:45,245 --> 00:07:13,550
very rough by where it ultimately landed but something that was better uh... and then in twenty fifteen it won the student award here at GDC uh... at the IGF uh... and uh... off of that we started getting kind of cocky we really thought oh maybe we really have the magic fairy dust here so we decided we were going to make a full version of the game a two hour movie length experience that could fully explore this concept and really break us as this studio to be reckoned with and uh... what did that lead to was

64
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:16,251
five years of constant failure.

65
00:07:17,132 --> 00:07:20,916
Um, so that's what this talk, talk is going to be about.

66
00:07:20,996 --> 00:07:28,262
It's going to be about the failure, this sort of cyclone of failure we found ourselves in, why it happened, how we eventually, eventually pulled ourselves out.

67
00:07:28,482 --> 00:07:32,105
And so it might seem a little grim at points, but I do promise a happy ending.

68
00:07:33,226 --> 00:07:36,009
Um, structure of the talk is going to be quickly

69
00:07:36,755 --> 00:07:44,961
take you through why I think we were failing so hard at these three key areas, and then just doubling back and explaining how I think I pulled us out of that rut.

70
00:07:45,221 --> 00:07:47,943
Not how I pulled us out, but how we pulled ourselves out.

71
00:07:48,684 --> 00:07:52,687
So we'll start with the first, which is the one I'm most responsible for, which was the story.

72
00:07:55,580 --> 00:08:04,827
Back in college, I actually had the pleasure of working as a part-time assistant for this amazing screenwriter, Michael Arndt, who has this great talk on the writing beginnings for Pixar that you can find on YouTube.

73
00:08:06,008 --> 00:08:11,012
But in it, he says this, that writing a script is like climbing a mountain with a blindfold.

74
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:20,825
What seems like the hard part is climbing the mountain, and it certainly is, but the really hard part, and the part that can really take years, is even finding the mountain at all.

75
00:08:22,866 --> 00:08:28,209
And that really resonates with me for this game because it took me five years to even find the mountain of this story.

76
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:57,554
and so to prepare for this speech I went back through all these different versions and it really was shocking to see how many versions there were of this game uh... the first one was you know a shameless death of the salesman ripoff which at twenty two years old I was audacious enough to literally steal dialogue from verbatim actually found the quote that I stole from I guess that's homage not plagiarism I'm not sure uh... you know then there was uh... this one which was kind of

77
00:08:58,214 --> 00:09:16,501
had this extending framing device, I think this was the GDC, I think, I don't, I literally don't remember which, which story went with which build at this point, but this, your estranged father is reminiscing with you and the twist, you know, takes you out on this fishing trip and the twist is that you've both been dead the whole time, which I most certainly stole from some Twilight Zone episode.

78
00:09:17,081 --> 00:09:21,703
Um, love that show, but that is basically always the twist, that they've been dead the whole time.

79
00:09:23,224 --> 00:09:34,694
And then we, you know, started experimenting with Twine for a while, so there was another version where, you know, we had all these different endings where you could end, like, as a rich CEO or you could die as an alcoholic on the street, and Twine is an incredible tool.

80
00:09:35,334 --> 00:09:39,058
But as I said, I'm very dumb, so it made me very confused very fast.

81
00:09:41,159 --> 00:09:43,542
And all these versions, I think, were clever enough.

82
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:48,646
If there's one thing I've always been OK at, it's consuming and internalizing other media.

83
00:09:49,087 --> 00:09:56,554
And I had no shortage of amazing work to pull from, which dealt with the themes that I felt this game needed to deal with, with death and regret and the passage of time.

84
00:09:57,034 --> 00:10:00,377
But the stories always just felt like excuses for a tech demo, really.

85
00:10:01,291 --> 00:10:05,574
They showed the potential of the concept, but taken on their own, they were inauthentic.

86
00:10:06,635 --> 00:10:13,660
But there was another big issue, which was, how the fuck are you supposed to tell a story when the player might blink out of any scene at any moment?

87
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:17,323
And that leads us into how we were failing at design.

88
00:10:19,358 --> 00:10:24,705
So for those short early versions of the game, literally every single time you blinked, you would jump forward.

89
00:10:25,226 --> 00:10:33,437
So if the player is good at staring contests, they might see the whole story, but if say they had allergies or hay fever that day, they'd just rapidly blink through all the most important scenes.

90
00:10:34,116 --> 00:10:41,702
It was sort of, you know, interesting in a punk way.

91
00:10:41,763 --> 00:10:45,786
But yeah, it was, as you can see here, it was not the most comfortable experience for our players.

92
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:57,596
And it kind of left me screwed over as a writer because, as we know, good writing is often built on structure and callbacks and how are you supposed to call back to something if I don't even know if the player has seen it or not.

93
00:10:58,176 --> 00:11:02,360
But it also felt like it was impossible to abandon this design principle because

94
00:11:02,864 --> 00:11:08,988
It was sort of core to the pitch of the game, which was every time you blink, you jump forward in time.

95
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,411
We found a couple short-term solutions.

96
00:11:13,452 --> 00:11:14,653
We took out 3D movement.

97
00:11:14,773 --> 00:11:18,656
We switched from text to VO, which was something I had always wanted to do anyway.

98
00:11:18,676 --> 00:11:23,319
And those just allowed you to focus more on the staring contest and not worry about other elements of the game.

99
00:11:24,234 --> 00:11:35,084
And we introduced that narrative's framing device, the dad on the boat, and that allowed us to at least have these little siloed sections where you would blink a bunch and then you would go back to the framing device and you could kind of rest your eyes.

100
00:11:35,204 --> 00:11:44,012
But no matter what we did, the player feedback was the same, that the game was fascinating and interesting and the concept was great, but it was really annoying to play.

101
00:11:44,753 --> 00:11:49,978
And it worked in a 15-minute festival setting, but it certainly wasn't going to work for two hours, and it certainly

102
00:11:50,498 --> 00:11:55,161
you know, wasn't something we could charge for unless we wanted to, you know, only have a bunch of refunds.

103
00:11:56,262 --> 00:12:03,546
Uh, and this led to big arguments, um, about how the Blink should work and, you know, should we abandon the Blink or find some new use for it?

104
00:12:03,686 --> 00:12:09,190
And, and that became this, you know, kind of philosophical argument about what the game is supposed to stand for.

105
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:12,012
And, you know, as this team full of

106
00:12:13,334 --> 00:12:15,095
old best friends, that was happening a lot.

107
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:24,759
You know, a conversation about, you know, some section of the game would spiral out into, you know, these giant, you know, arguments about who we are as people.

108
00:12:24,939 --> 00:12:29,161
And so that kind of leads into how we were failing so badly at our process.

109
00:12:30,842 --> 00:12:46,681
you know after uh the big win at IndieCade and IGF we got cocky and we did what all indie teams do when they get cocky we uh made a kickstarter and uh it uh it funded uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh

110
00:12:46,761 --> 00:12:47,221
We raised $35,000.

111
00:12:48,443 --> 00:12:53,867
And I still laugh when I look at that number, considering the scope of what we were trying to do.

112
00:12:53,967 --> 00:12:56,630
We were all like, you know, cheersing each other after that.

113
00:12:56,690 --> 00:13:02,334
But we were young and basically consisted of five high school friends, none of whom had ever shipped a game before.

114
00:13:04,777 --> 00:13:07,679
And we were heading into our actual 20s.

115
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:11,742
You know, college was behind us and our side gigs were turning into real jobs.

116
00:13:12,603 --> 00:13:31,014
and time was getting tighter and tighter, which was stressful enough on its own, but then, you know, we had these Kickstarter backers and they were getting angry, which was totally fair, because we had over-promised and under-delivered, as a lot of Kickstarters do, and our comment section quickly devolved from these words of encouragement to tirades against us.

117
00:13:31,074 --> 00:13:32,614
Here's a favorite.

118
00:13:34,997 --> 00:13:45,203
I just like when he says blowing smoke up my ass while you spend backer money on whatever yuppity fuck sushi lunch or new age toys you choose.

119
00:13:47,133 --> 00:13:50,676
I just think, I mean, we weren't doing that, but I just think it's kind of good dialogue, you know?

120
00:13:50,696 --> 00:13:53,198
It kind of feels like David Mamet or something.

121
00:13:53,799 --> 00:13:55,340
But this guy's good.

122
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,861
This guy's got a future.

123
00:14:00,764 --> 00:14:08,691
Yeah, so we began to feel that there was this angry public outside with pitchforks, which only compounded our stress, so we did what any

124
00:14:09,031 --> 00:14:13,212
team of immature man children would do in that situation, we turned on each other.

125
00:14:14,152 --> 00:14:17,213
And we started pointing fingers and we started blaming.

126
00:14:17,973 --> 00:14:23,875
And of all our failures as a team, and this is a talk about failures, this is really the only one that I'm actually ashamed of.

127
00:14:25,095 --> 00:14:30,097
You know, because you really can't create anything without an emotionally safe environment.

128
00:14:30,177 --> 00:14:31,617
And you can't call yourself a team

129
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:33,250
unless you trust each other.

130
00:14:33,350 --> 00:14:37,371
And a couple years into our failed Kickstarter, we found we had neither of those things.

131
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:54,155
And that was really hard for us to admit to ourselves because we were all such old friends and we loved each other so much, but maybe that was sort of part of the problem, that we loved each other too much, kind of like family, and there wasn't, you know, the kind of clear boundaries that you maybe want in a work situation.

132
00:14:57,625 --> 00:15:02,753
In the months passed into years, the game became a kind of real source of stress for me and I think for the whole team.

133
00:15:02,853 --> 00:15:04,135
I mean, I'll only speak for myself.

134
00:15:04,195 --> 00:15:09,484
You know, I'd be out at dinner and a family member or friend would say, hey, what happened to that game I gave 40 bucks to, you know, two years ago?

135
00:15:10,222 --> 00:15:11,883
I'd have to try and explain it away.

136
00:15:11,903 --> 00:15:21,786
And it felt like a really impossible situation because on one hand, we all knew what we were doing wasn't working and our lives and mental health would definitely be better if we just abandoned it.

137
00:15:22,266 --> 00:15:24,006
But we also had too much pride.

138
00:15:24,307 --> 00:15:29,088
And I think, you know, we still somewhere really did believe in this game.

139
00:15:29,148 --> 00:15:31,369
We just had no idea how to make it.

140
00:15:32,609 --> 00:15:38,031
And, you know, I'd like to say, now we're going to get to the solving problems part of the talk, I'd like to say that, you know,

141
00:15:39,136 --> 00:15:39,296
just

142
00:15:56,057 --> 00:15:59,780
make that clear, but they're a company that was recently bought by Verizon.

143
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:02,682
They were looking to fund sort of experimental VR and AR.

144
00:16:02,722 --> 00:16:05,704
We were their first, like, you know, game.

145
00:16:05,744 --> 00:16:10,467
We kind of got in under the wire, you know, because we were going to do a VR slice of the game.

146
00:16:11,287 --> 00:16:20,933
But we ended up meeting this producer, Jake Sally, there, who'd been aware of our game from back in the day, and he felt like it was a great fit, and he convinced us to come in and pitch it to his bosses.

147
00:16:21,934 --> 00:16:35,595
You know, I said this to Jake recently on text, but there's really no way that I'd be here or anything would have happened if it weren't for meeting him at that point, because for some reason he chose to believe in the game and the team at a point when truly no one on the team believed in it.

148
00:16:37,938 --> 00:16:50,150
Later we also signed to Skybound Games and they were equally, I mean probably more important for the game's success, but I focus on Jake for this talk because he's really the guy that kind of was the light in the darkness.

149
00:16:51,571 --> 00:16:55,815
And you'll find those people throughout the life of making games.

150
00:16:56,784 --> 00:16:57,345
Um, yeah.

151
00:16:57,445 --> 00:17:03,951
But so to our surprise, Riot decided they wanted to fund us and it wasn't a ton of money, but it was enough that some of us could go full time for a little bit.

152
00:17:04,592 --> 00:17:07,234
And, uh, more important than that, we could bring on new team members.

153
00:17:07,555 --> 00:17:14,041
And, uh, you know, the team really started to grow and it grew outside of just a bunch of childhood friends.

154
00:17:14,865 --> 00:17:24,795
And this is, you know, how you fix a process because, you know, first of all, you just sort of have to button up when you actually enter a real professional situation.

155
00:17:24,835 --> 00:17:26,577
You get other voices, other perspectives.

156
00:17:27,138 --> 00:17:33,724
And you also get, you know, when you're this long into working on something, you've completely forgotten what makes it cool or what makes it exciting.

157
00:17:34,165 --> 00:17:34,945
I mean, I think that

158
00:17:35,766 --> 00:17:35,886
out

159
00:17:49,468 --> 00:18:08,714
to uh uh rejuvenate a process and uh the other thing we started to do is we had the infrastructure to playtest and so Jake would help us organize playtests with the Riot employees and obviously playtesting is helpful but I found one of the things that you know consistent playtesting and obviously this is anyone in games this should be obvious but as I said

160
00:18:09,363 --> 00:18:13,486
We were dumb, so it took us a while to learn this, but it helps you table arguments.

161
00:18:14,606 --> 00:18:18,509
If you're disagreeing, you can just say, well, we'll find out at the play test.

162
00:18:18,549 --> 00:18:20,570
And it just makes everything feel a little less personal.

163
00:18:22,592 --> 00:18:25,494
And that kind of led us into how we solved the design of the game.

164
00:18:26,454 --> 00:18:32,258
We had hired a new designer, Bella Messicks, who had just launched his own game, Little Bug, which is very cool.

165
00:18:32,959 --> 00:18:33,979
You guys can check it out.

166
00:18:34,199 --> 00:18:35,920
He was a solo dev, and we brought him on.

167
00:18:37,998 --> 00:18:41,441
He was one of the people that really helped us start looking at the concept with fresh eyes.

168
00:18:41,521 --> 00:18:44,725
And he was like, why are you guys not just using Blink?

169
00:18:45,365 --> 00:18:47,388
Why are you just using Blink for this one thing?

170
00:18:47,468 --> 00:18:51,352
Can't Blink be used for other things that can be more fun and joyous?

171
00:18:52,153 --> 00:18:57,078
And he just kicked off a conversation that became months long with tons of iterations.

172
00:18:57,318 --> 00:18:59,501
But we kind of landed on

173
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:04,721
Embracing that idea, you know, that we could use blinks for other things than just passing time forward.

174
00:19:04,761 --> 00:19:11,805
So we started using blinks to do things like you blink and you reveal the environment around you or, uh, what just happened there?

175
00:19:14,222 --> 00:19:19,105
And you take photos, or play music, or paint.

176
00:19:19,245 --> 00:19:30,432
But because we still need to retain that essential idea from the game, that genius idea of Will's, at a certain point in the scene, you're going to see this little metronome come up.

177
00:19:30,572 --> 00:19:34,554
Well, not yet here, but about midway through the scene, you're going to see this little metronome show up.

178
00:19:34,974 --> 00:19:38,316
And now the game is going to play like the game always played before.

179
00:19:39,297 --> 00:19:42,979
And so this is telling you that the next time you blink, it's going to be your last.

180
00:19:43,899 --> 00:19:54,506
And what's really cool about that is like, we were able to, you know, put the scenes into these two halves, so you didn't have to be constantly frustrating and freaking the player out.

181
00:19:54,526 --> 00:20:03,472
You could let them have fun, let them actually in and enjoy the moment of the scene, and then introduce that tension of, okay, you're about to leave.

182
00:20:04,311 --> 00:20:13,522
And we could also kind of mix those two designs because we could introduce, like you see here, interactables, blinks, after the metronome, and those are like these little islands.

183
00:20:13,562 --> 00:20:20,230
So it's like if you blinked before you got to that, then you would jump forward, but you can kind of jump over to that and blink, and that can help you to stay in the scene.

184
00:20:20,610 --> 00:20:31,779
So we actually found by sort of being a little more flexible with our concept, we were really able to actually bring out what was great about that initial concept, and we didn't have to lose it.

185
00:20:33,140 --> 00:20:43,789
And it allowed me to retain that sense of frustration of, shit, I missed it, I keep missing out on things, but also not letting that frustration totally dominate the experience.

186
00:20:45,710 --> 00:20:50,094
And you can see here, like this is a little scene from the final script.

187
00:20:50,875 --> 00:20:55,179
And every scene I was able to kind of write at the bottom, at that time we called it the blink counter.

188
00:20:56,568 --> 00:21:00,009
I don't know why.

189
00:21:00,069 --> 00:21:16,094
So I could kind of know, okay, I'm going to put the necessary stuff, the stuff that you need to know that I might call back to before that, but then once that comes up, I'm still going to leave, we had an amazing voice cast, I'm still going to leave all this really charming dialogue and funny stuff.

190
00:21:17,205 --> 00:21:23,609
and interesting moments that fill out the experience that you can still miss and still get that feeling of, oh god, I missed out.

191
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:29,353
But you're not going to just jump through stuff that you need to even understand the story at all.

192
00:21:29,413 --> 00:21:37,419
So we were able to have our cake and eat it too, which leads to how I ultimately solved the writing part of the game.

193
00:21:39,084 --> 00:21:41,645
I think the real key to it was that I had time.

194
00:21:42,425 --> 00:21:46,647
As I said before, most of the other team were taking other jobs.

195
00:21:46,707 --> 00:21:53,849
And when we started with Ride, I was able to have about four months where I was the sole person working on the game full time.

196
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:58,611
And I recognize this is a really rare opportunity for game writers.

197
00:21:58,791 --> 00:22:02,192
We're often asked to fit our work around crazy production schedules.

198
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:06,654
But I think as writers, we sometimes have to advocate for that importance of that time and just

199
00:22:07,114 --> 00:22:11,995
uninterrupted time, because I really do believe the most important work happens in your subconscious.

200
00:22:12,536 --> 00:22:18,457
And if you don't have that time to think and to gestate, and you're always on that next deadline, you're not going to access the deep work.

201
00:22:19,798 --> 00:22:21,398
And that's what those four months gave me.

202
00:22:21,618 --> 00:22:28,380
And so I'd have these long meetings with Will, and sometimes our art director Griffin, and Ollie, who would become a co-director on the game.

203
00:22:28,760 --> 00:22:30,901
And we'd all just sit around and

204
00:22:31,534 --> 00:22:40,792
and you know pitch ideas and then I get to go off and write and at the end of the week I'd send them stuff and they'd send me reactions and you know it was it was sort of a dream for a writer.

205
00:22:45,018 --> 00:22:56,267
And, uh, I realized that what was holding me back for so long was this imposter syndrome because, you know, all those years ago, Will had brought me this incredible idea, maybe my favorite idea of all time.

206
00:22:56,948 --> 00:23:01,331
And I felt like it could be the most meaningful and heartbreaking work ever.

207
00:23:01,391 --> 00:23:05,375
I think there was just something about a blanket, you know, you're going to literally blink through someone's life.

208
00:23:06,175 --> 00:23:09,238
Um, and it kind of felt like, why isn't, you know, Terrence Malick doing this?

209
00:23:09,298 --> 00:23:10,539
Why am I doing this?

210
00:23:11,424 --> 00:23:24,558
and to kind of give up on that feeling of we're going to do the best version and just try to figure out what's the version that I know how to do and what's the version that this team knows how to do.

211
00:23:27,833 --> 00:23:30,395
because that was something we had that other teams didn't.

212
00:23:30,415 --> 00:23:31,777
We were all childhood friends.

213
00:23:31,837 --> 00:23:37,262
We grew up within biking distance of each other, and we were all intimately aware of each other's upbringings and life story.

214
00:23:37,662 --> 00:23:39,424
That's me and Will at prom.

215
00:23:40,344 --> 00:23:43,167
That's Ollie and I when we were literally four years old.

216
00:23:43,207 --> 00:23:44,248
There's Griffin and Ollie.

217
00:23:44,348 --> 00:23:46,030
I don't know what they're doing there with their boxers.

218
00:23:50,069 --> 00:23:58,255
So we started kind of taking a walk down memory lane, and we digitized old home movies of our real childhood memories, and we're sharing things with each other.

219
00:23:58,376 --> 00:24:03,119
And a lot of the props and environments you'll see in the final game are taken directly from those home movies.

220
00:24:03,219 --> 00:24:08,684
Like the house in the game is actually based directly on Ollie's childhood home, which I grew up two doors down from.

221
00:24:09,464 --> 00:24:14,808
You can see there at the wrap party for the game, we actually projected a streamer playing the game against the house.

222
00:24:15,669 --> 00:24:19,534
that the house in the game was based on, so it was a very meta, crazy moment.

223
00:24:21,826 --> 00:24:28,169
But through the process of unearthing these memories, I started to think about a time in my life that I didn't think about that often.

224
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:35,193
In middle school, I dealt with a pretty severe chronic illness, had to have a big surgery and was homeschooled for a year and a half.

225
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:37,835
There's a picture of me in the hospital.

226
00:24:38,635 --> 00:24:40,116
And yeah, that was a tough time.

227
00:24:40,516 --> 00:24:47,980
And a lot of memories and emotions I realized, you know, going back, I realized, you know, I had repressed, I had not thought about these things in a long time.

228
00:24:48,621 --> 00:24:56,260
and bringing those memories back led me down the path to finally breaking this story and finally finding the mountain that I felt I was meant to be climbing.

229
00:24:57,014 --> 00:25:24,302
uh... which was figuring out the central twist that the plot hinges on which if you play the game you'll know but i won't spoil uh... actually found this photo on face book yesterday they've been posted by ollie and i like this one one comment why the fuck did you put this on the internet but you know i'm actually this is i i i guess fifteen-year-old met me was angry that he put that on face book but i'm not now you know thirty-year-old me is thirty one-year-old me is very uh... happy that he did so i had it for this speech uh...

230
00:25:27,626 --> 00:25:38,910
But all at once, sort of in a meeting with Holly, I figured this thing out and I rushed home and I wrote out a little two-page fable version of it and I sent it to Holly and Will and for the first time there was unanimous praise.

231
00:25:38,950 --> 00:25:39,690
There was no fighting.

232
00:25:40,431 --> 00:25:44,272
They both told me they cried after reading it and we all felt sure this was going to be the game.

233
00:25:45,112 --> 00:25:48,613
You know, only four years late, but we got there.

234
00:25:51,383 --> 00:26:06,248
And of all the positive press we received, this little article on fanbite is one of the ones I'm most proud of, because this writer had no way of knowing that some of this stuff came from personal experience, but she could somehow feel that, because she had gone through that same experience.

235
00:26:06,308 --> 00:26:08,568
So she didn't need to fact check it, she just knew.

236
00:26:10,949 --> 00:26:22,097
And, you know, I've always hated that advice to write what you know, because I always felt like I'd never experienced anything worth writing about, but I also think genuinely you should write about whatever you want.

237
00:26:23,518 --> 00:26:33,126
But I do think what I learned is that on some level you should be, or for certain projects, I think you want to be able to be able to write from a place of personal vulnerability.

238
00:26:34,767 --> 00:26:43,855
to approach subjects that make you uncomfortable, things that you maybe want to run away from, you know, you have to be maybe a little bit willing to put your hand on the stove and hold it there.

239
00:26:43,895 --> 00:26:54,464
And I think if you kind of force yourself in that direction, you know, into those vulnerable, uncomfortable places, I think that's where, you know, a lot of the magic really starts to happen.

240
00:26:55,496 --> 00:27:00,100
Um, and don't just regurgitate the structures from other media that you've consumed.

241
00:27:00,140 --> 00:27:02,082
Cause that's what I did for, for all those years.

242
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:03,543
And again, it didn't work.

243
00:27:04,324 --> 00:27:09,909
And you know, uh, we all know there's something coming that is probably going to be better at doing that than all of us.

244
00:27:10,770 --> 00:27:16,415
Um, and one thing chat GPT can't do is be vulnerable.

245
00:27:16,535 --> 00:27:20,038
So I think, uh, now more than ever, it's a good time to, to lean on that.

246
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,120
Uh, yeah, so.

247
00:27:23,513 --> 00:27:29,018
Looking back, if there was one thing our team needed earlier, it was to get comfortable with that discomfort.

248
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:34,904
And I would have hated to hear that seven years ago, but I just think it takes a certain amount of life experience to get to that place.

249
00:27:36,025 --> 00:27:40,769
In 2014, we had set off to make this game about loss, but we didn't really know anything about loss.

250
00:27:43,212 --> 00:27:45,694
But in the seven years of failure, we got to know it very well.

251
00:27:45,934 --> 00:28:01,410
First was the loss of the dream that we'd be the successful rockstar indie studio out of the gate, but we also endured personal losses, family members, ended long-term relationships and partnerships, and even friendships, some of which were strained to the point of breaking by the very pressures of making this game.

252
00:28:03,393 --> 00:28:09,900
And I just wanted to take a moment, in case anyone ever finds this who worked on this game, just take a moment to share some gratitude for anyone who worked on this.

253
00:28:09,920 --> 00:28:12,042
There was so many people that worked on this game.

254
00:28:12,082 --> 00:28:15,386
There were so many errors and so many people that put so much of themselves into it.

255
00:28:15,765 --> 00:28:24,173
And I worry sometimes that the ones that didn't get to see it through at the end feel like they can't share in its success, but they absolutely should because the game really does belong to everyone.

256
00:28:24,213 --> 00:28:28,197
I mean, yeah, a game that takes that long has a lot of authors.

257
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:29,918
And yeah.

258
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,682
So the story ends with us winning a BAFTA.

259
00:28:35,123 --> 00:28:36,725
Winning a BAFTA is a crazy process.

260
00:28:36,925 --> 00:28:40,929
After you get it, you're taken off stage and you have to sign all this paperwork, which

261
00:28:41,348 --> 00:28:51,101
stipulates that you don't own the BAFTA, but you're actually renting the BAFTA from them, and you gotta take care of it, and you can't sell it, and you can't let it get stolen or lose it.

262
00:28:52,222 --> 00:28:57,089
But at the after party, I lost both of the BAFTAs.

263
00:29:03,056 --> 00:29:05,297
So it actually ends with me losing a BAFTA.

264
00:29:05,457 --> 00:29:06,498
I was drunk.

265
00:29:07,278 --> 00:29:08,599
I was supposed to be watching them.

266
00:29:08,639 --> 00:29:11,821
I tried to blame Ollie for a while, but I'll admit it here, it was me.

267
00:29:14,362 --> 00:29:16,623
And then I came back and he said, you were supposed to be watching.

268
00:29:16,643 --> 00:29:18,004
And we ran back and they were gone.

269
00:29:18,784 --> 00:29:21,166
This was an email we had to send to BAFTA.

270
00:29:22,459 --> 00:29:30,025
and we had to send the last photo that we had of it.

271
00:29:30,485 --> 00:29:33,808
As if we didn't already seem like two dumb Americans who didn't deserve our BAFTAs.

272
00:29:34,529 --> 00:29:38,472
There's Ollie looking like an idiot with the two BAFTAs.

273
00:29:40,839 --> 00:29:43,120
Yeah, but don't worry, you know, it worked out.

274
00:29:43,740 --> 00:29:54,024
It turned out just the Forza team had won so many BAFTAs they thought they were theirs, so then they sent them back in.

275
00:29:54,344 --> 00:30:01,426
But in the span of those two hours, I went from feeling like this artistic genius to once again the biggest idiot on earth.

276
00:30:02,426 --> 00:30:09,829
And my phone had died in the process, so by the time my phone came back to life, we had lost the BAFTAs, so my first call to my parents was an

277
00:30:09,949 --> 00:30:34,906
I won a BAFTA it was I lost my BAFTA which is a bummer but you know I tell that story to just illustrate that the years of failure aren't going to be all made worthwhile by reaching some big glorious ending and if you think about it like that you're definitely going to be disappointed because you know the universe has a way of reminding you who you are that just a dumb guy who couldn't make it through an Intro to Unity course

278
00:30:36,415 --> 00:30:51,853
uh... and over the last year we started work on a new title we're still part of the goodbye world family but we've actually created a brand new studio called nice dream which literally just went public today so we don't have like any followers so if you guys wanna get in on the ground floor there it is

279
00:30:52,834 --> 00:31:00,057
Um, and we're still idiots and we fail constantly but I think that what this one success has given us it's the ability to not be so afraid of failure.

280
00:31:00,657 --> 00:31:10,281
Um, the team certainly still argues over what the right path is but we just sort of assume that everyone's a little bit wrong and that we'll find out later in play testing.

281
00:31:11,162 --> 00:31:11,262
Um,

282
00:31:12,426 --> 00:31:17,829
The last couple years I've gotten really into two things, jackass and, you know, from software games.

283
00:31:18,889 --> 00:31:20,650
These have been my comfort viewing.

284
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:24,072
For some reason, going back to jackass, I don't know why.

285
00:31:25,573 --> 00:31:40,560
But I was thinking about it and I realized what links the two and why maybe I like them so much is that they're really about celebrating human failure and our incredible ability to know that we're going to lose and that we're going to get very, very hurt, but still go out and try to do impossible things.

286
00:31:43,906 --> 00:31:52,449
And if you choose to make games for a living, or any highly collaborative art form, that's what it's going to be like.

287
00:31:52,509 --> 00:31:56,391
Sort of like trying to win a staring contest with a web camera.

288
00:31:58,152 --> 00:32:01,173
You're inevitably going to lose over and over and over again.

289
00:32:02,673 --> 00:32:03,474
And then you're going to die.

290
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:07,215
So there's your happy ending.

291
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:09,716
Hope you guys all enjoyed it.

292
00:32:09,776 --> 00:32:11,617
Thank you so much for attending.
