1
00:00:06,671 --> 00:00:14,758
Actually, before we start, they want me to remind you that they're going to send an evaluation form about 10 minutes before the end of the talk.

2
00:00:14,758 --> 00:00:18,361
So you should check your spam filters just to make sure you get it.

3
00:00:18,361 --> 00:00:28,429
And also, if there's time for questions at the end, which I'm not sure about yet, please use the microphones.

4
00:00:28,429 --> 00:00:30,010
There's one there, one on the other side.

5
00:00:33,008 --> 00:00:39,170
and we're good. And maybe if you could, just for me, just maybe compressed in the middle, just a bit,

6
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:48,033
just so it's more intimate. If you want, you don't have to, but as a favor, I would really like it.

7
00:00:48,033 --> 00:00:49,074
Okay, let's start.

8
00:01:02,968 --> 00:01:13,593
Welcome, good morning, my name is Frank. I work at Eidos Montreal. I was a designer on their Sex Human Revolution. Right now I'm a Gameplay Director.

9
00:01:17,235 --> 00:01:20,356
Daresex was a big project for me.

10
00:01:20,356 --> 00:01:23,197
I've been in the industry for 12 years now,

11
00:01:23,197 --> 00:01:25,778
and when I started on Daresex,

12
00:01:25,778 --> 00:01:28,519
I had been in the industry for only seven.

13
00:01:28,519 --> 00:01:31,980
So I had a lot to learn, it was a huge endeavor,

14
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:34,620
but it was the best project for me.

15
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,681
It really, really hit home.

16
00:01:41,394 --> 00:01:48,278
I'm a bit emotional about it actually because everything went so right for such a big project

17
00:01:48,278 --> 00:01:54,482
and what I want to talk to you about today is what are the steps that we went through

18
00:01:54,482 --> 00:02:01,466
to make this game and bring back the franchise and also get the feeling of what a Deus Ex game is.

19
00:02:01,466 --> 00:02:04,388
So let's start with the boring stuff.

20
00:02:04,388 --> 00:02:04,468
Me.

21
00:02:04,468 --> 00:02:04,648
Who am I?

22
00:02:09,465 --> 00:02:12,767
I started in the industry in 2000. I said that already. So

23
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:17,930
let's move on. I worked at Ubisoft Montreal for five. I

24
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:22,532
joined IDOS in 2007. I have a cat. Whoa. A quick cat. And I

25
00:02:22,532 --> 00:02:36,680
still have trouble saying their sex or whatever it is. Feel free

26
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,361
to correct me.

27
00:02:38,497 --> 00:02:42,479
And I have a weird fascination for David Hasselhoff.

28
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,961
Yay!

29
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:48,082
Okay, my ship games.

30
00:02:48,082 --> 00:02:49,002
And my role on DxHR.

31
00:02:49,002 --> 00:02:59,327
I was a senior game designer, a general pain in the neck for animators, programmers, and

32
00:02:59,327 --> 00:03:00,988
also level designers.

33
00:03:00,988 --> 00:03:02,769
This is what you heard often when I came in.

34
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:09,481
I was responsible for augmentations, conversations,

35
00:03:09,481 --> 00:03:16,163
cover system, hacking, combat AI, stealth AI,

36
00:03:16,163 --> 00:03:19,665
balancing and objects and pickups.

37
00:03:19,665 --> 00:03:22,846
Now before you assume that I was the only designer

38
00:03:22,846 --> 00:03:25,787
on the project, know that there was three of us.

39
00:03:25,787 --> 00:03:27,307
That's Tony in the foreground

40
00:03:27,307 --> 00:03:29,328
and Pierre-Francis in the background.

41
00:03:29,328 --> 00:03:30,408
And no, he's not that short,

42
00:03:30,408 --> 00:03:31,969
he's just leaning against the wall.

43
00:03:32,752 --> 00:03:38,977
The point I want to make before I continue with the presentation is the fact that there was a lot, a lot of work to do on this game.

44
00:03:38,977 --> 00:03:43,862
A lot of systems that had to work together and there was only three of us to do everything.

45
00:03:43,862 --> 00:03:47,085
And honestly, I wouldn't have it any other way.

46
00:03:47,085 --> 00:03:50,808
Having only three designers meant that we got to touch everything.

47
00:03:50,808 --> 00:03:57,775
Even though I started hacking, Tony was the one to actually finish it and do all the subsystems, the subnets, sorry.

48
00:03:58,595 --> 00:04:03,498
And it allowed us to have a more cohesive game design.

49
00:04:03,498 --> 00:04:06,179
So instead of having one designer working on something

50
00:04:06,179 --> 00:04:08,300
on his own side, and then another designer,

51
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:09,401
at the end you bring it together.

52
00:04:09,401 --> 00:04:11,202
Everybody touched everything.

53
00:04:11,202 --> 00:04:14,884
We knew what everybody else was doing on their project.

54
00:04:14,884 --> 00:04:18,385
So what am I gonna talk about today?

55
00:04:18,385 --> 00:04:23,128
I'm gonna talk about the challenges we face

56
00:04:23,128 --> 00:04:25,309
capturing the feeling of what is their sex game.

57
00:04:26,465 --> 00:04:29,886
I want to also talk about the conversation boss fights,

58
00:04:29,886 --> 00:04:31,847
how we design them.

59
00:04:31,847 --> 00:04:38,831
Hacking, the upgrade system, energy system, the boss fights.

60
00:04:38,831 --> 00:04:40,592
Yeah, I got a few explanations for you on that.

61
00:04:40,592 --> 00:04:44,114
And balancing.

62
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:46,475
Okay, so what is their sex?

63
00:04:46,475 --> 00:04:49,797
Does anybody here who doesn't know what their sex is?

64
00:04:52,006 --> 00:04:53,326
Well, I got an explanation for you anyway.

65
00:04:53,326 --> 00:04:56,027
It's an action role-playing game combining elements

66
00:04:56,027 --> 00:04:59,228
of first-person shooters and role-playing game.

67
00:04:59,228 --> 00:05:03,349
It's also often praised as the best PC game of all time.

68
00:05:03,349 --> 00:05:12,691
There was a sequel, Invisible War.

69
00:05:12,691 --> 00:05:14,631
It did pretty good, as you can see from the rating.

70
00:05:14,631 --> 00:05:16,972
But when you go on the net and you see

71
00:05:16,972 --> 00:05:20,213
what some people think about it, they don't always agree.

72
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:27,703
There was also another planned sequel called,

73
00:05:27,703 --> 00:05:30,005
at the time it wasn't called Project Snowblind,

74
00:05:30,005 --> 00:05:33,147
but they decided to rename the project during production.

75
00:05:33,147 --> 00:05:34,408
I don't really know why.

76
00:05:34,408 --> 00:05:36,490
If anybody here worked on Project Snowblind,

77
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:39,192
I'd love to talk to you and actually know what went on.

78
00:05:39,192 --> 00:05:42,175
I just know it started as a sequel to Their Sex,

79
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:44,837
and then they renamed it and shipped it.

80
00:05:44,837 --> 00:05:47,119
And there was another sequel,

81
00:05:47,119 --> 00:05:49,241
which nobody here knows about.

82
00:05:49,241 --> 00:05:52,643
It never went past the game, the design document stage.

83
00:05:54,595 --> 00:05:57,476
It's a pity though because they had pretty good ideas in there.

84
00:05:57,476 --> 00:06:06,462
So essentially we were tasked into doing what is the third attempt at a sequel.

85
00:06:06,462 --> 00:06:08,243
So we started with the first two games.

86
00:06:23,246 --> 00:06:26,187
Design documents for invisible war and insurrection.

87
00:06:26,187 --> 00:06:27,467
And that's pretty much it.

88
00:06:27,467 --> 00:06:32,308
We had no formal direction set by the company.

89
00:06:32,308 --> 00:06:35,649
Essentially they gave us the key to the franchise.

90
00:06:35,649 --> 00:06:39,410
They didn't even send a producer overseas to watch over us.

91
00:06:39,410 --> 00:06:42,371
It was only us, bunch of guys in Montreal,

92
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:44,612
trying to figure out what to do,

93
00:06:44,612 --> 00:06:47,152
how to do a new dare sex game.

94
00:06:47,152 --> 00:06:49,233
Anybody from Ubisoft here?

95
00:06:51,771 --> 00:07:00,818
So we knew that getting the feeling of whether there's sex here was crucial.

96
00:07:00,818 --> 00:07:07,724
So yeah, we knew that getting the feeling was crucial, and we knew it was our biggest challenge.

97
00:07:07,724 --> 00:07:10,826
And we had absolutely no idea how to do it.

98
00:07:10,826 --> 00:07:14,870
We knew that other games had tried.

99
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:17,111
So obviously it wasn't easy.

100
00:07:20,785 --> 00:07:27,432
prepared for the big dive. This is what we did to get a feel for the game.

101
00:07:27,432 --> 00:07:34,199
So there was a creative core comprised of myself, there was the production designer Jonathan,

102
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:38,383
there was JF, the creative director, and there was David, our producer.

103
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,625
And we just started to get immersed.

104
00:07:41,255 --> 00:07:47,920
in all kinds of materials. The idea was for the creative core to bathe in all the same references

105
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:54,824
so that we would have a kind of a basis for talking about ideas so nobody would come out

106
00:07:54,824 --> 00:08:01,809
of left field with stuff. We pretty, we had a self-contained idea of where we were going.

107
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:08,654
So we started reading books and playing games and watching movies, checking out role-playing

108
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,816
games and have lively discussions.

109
00:08:12,254 --> 00:08:15,836
And that gave us a creative father for what would come up next.

110
00:08:15,836 --> 00:08:19,038
So the lesson to me here was that nothing is created from nothing.

111
00:08:19,038 --> 00:08:22,180
We really needed to immerse ourselves with ideas,

112
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:28,905
to really fill our cranium with juice that would essentially feed the rest of the process.

113
00:08:28,905 --> 00:08:34,948
We also replayed the first game.

114
00:08:34,948 --> 00:08:38,631
I remember that while playing the game, I had played it way back when in 2000,

115
00:08:38,631 --> 00:08:40,852
I really loved it.

116
00:08:41,354 --> 00:08:45,056
At the time we started working on Human Revolution,

117
00:08:45,056 --> 00:08:49,119
I had pretty much forgotten a lot of it, so we replayed it.

118
00:08:49,119 --> 00:08:52,141
I remember that when I played it, I did not take any notes.

119
00:08:52,141 --> 00:08:56,023
It was something that I now call an instinctive playthrough.

120
00:08:56,023 --> 00:09:00,246
So I just played the game and allowed myself to enjoy it,

121
00:09:00,246 --> 00:09:01,366
but also hate it.

122
00:09:03,467 --> 00:09:07,290
to essentially place myself in the player's position.

123
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:12,015
As a game designer, I tend to take a lot of notes when I play games.

124
00:09:12,015 --> 00:09:17,360
And sometimes you miss the forest for the trees.

125
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,423
You delve into too much detail and you forget

126
00:09:20,423 --> 00:09:23,686
what the player is supposed to experience while playing your game.

127
00:09:23,686 --> 00:09:26,849
And that's why I wanted to experience deersex first,

128
00:09:26,849 --> 00:09:29,271
and then go delve into mechanics.

129
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:32,900
And so that's what we did.

130
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:36,743
We went, we took the game guides, we analyzed everything.

131
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:38,344
We also went on forums.

132
00:09:38,344 --> 00:09:42,367
We wanted to know what other people thought about the game.

133
00:09:42,367 --> 00:09:46,129
We felt it was important to see if what we thought,

134
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:48,531
our opinion of the game, the way we felt about it,

135
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:50,872
was in line with what other people thought.

136
00:09:52,404 --> 00:09:54,666
It was good for our self-confidence.

137
00:09:54,666 --> 00:09:58,128
So just to see that, indeed, other people thought

138
00:09:58,128 --> 00:10:00,530
that features that we like, they like too,

139
00:10:00,530 --> 00:10:04,733
and features that we didn't like, they didn't like.

140
00:10:04,733 --> 00:10:08,796
It made us think, sorry, that maybe we were the right team

141
00:10:08,796 --> 00:10:12,258
to bring this game after all, to make this game after all.

142
00:10:12,258 --> 00:10:15,140
So we also had round tables with, oh, I'm sorry,

143
00:10:15,140 --> 00:10:16,781
we looked at reviews.

144
00:10:17,578 --> 00:10:20,200
to see the features that people like.

145
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,420
And then we had round tables.

146
00:10:21,420 --> 00:10:24,402
We just talked with people on the team

147
00:10:24,402 --> 00:10:26,643
and see what their opinion was.

148
00:10:26,643 --> 00:10:28,603
And eventually a picture emerged.

149
00:10:28,603 --> 00:10:30,524
And we saw that pretty,

150
00:10:30,524 --> 00:10:32,945
even though some people thought the games were perfect

151
00:10:32,945 --> 00:10:34,686
and it's fine, that was their opinion,

152
00:10:34,686 --> 00:10:37,347
we saw that a lot of people thought,

153
00:10:37,347 --> 00:10:40,149
well, I don't like this or this I love a lot.

154
00:10:40,149 --> 00:10:43,550
And all their opinions were pretty much the same

155
00:10:43,550 --> 00:10:44,471
at some point.

156
00:10:45,574 --> 00:10:52,957
So we saw the beginnings of a pattern and we also saw that our perception was in line with most people out there.

157
00:10:52,957 --> 00:10:59,779
Had that not been the case, had our opinions been totally different from what everybody else thought,

158
00:10:59,779 --> 00:11:04,681
then we would have second-guessed ourselves a lot throughout production

159
00:11:04,681 --> 00:11:08,442
and we couldn't have produced the game that we eventually did.

160
00:11:11,463 --> 00:11:13,964
So the critique of their sex.

161
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:15,825
The big dive brought us to this,

162
00:11:15,825 --> 00:11:19,647
having, now that we knew what everybody thought,

163
00:11:19,647 --> 00:11:23,568
we were ready to do a formal critique of the game.

164
00:11:23,568 --> 00:11:29,151
So yes, I'm about to say some negative things

165
00:11:29,151 --> 00:11:31,611
about the best PC game of all times.

166
00:11:31,611 --> 00:11:33,232
I'm sorry.

167
00:11:33,232 --> 00:11:35,773
It's not that I want to, it's not that we had to.

168
00:11:35,773 --> 00:11:38,894
A game, well to me at least,

169
00:11:38,894 --> 00:11:41,175
has to come from the gut at some point.

170
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,742
And to really do that, to really infuse ourselves

171
00:11:45,742 --> 00:11:47,163
in the game we were gonna make,

172
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:49,444
we had to be really honest about how we felt

173
00:11:49,444 --> 00:11:50,345
about the franchise.

174
00:11:50,345 --> 00:11:55,888
So I love their sex, don't worry about that.

175
00:11:55,888 --> 00:11:58,369
Oh, power stance, nice.

176
00:11:58,369 --> 00:11:59,630
Okay, the critique.

177
00:11:59,630 --> 00:12:04,932
This is a critique for the action sequence in the game.

178
00:12:04,932 --> 00:12:06,653
I'm gonna let you read it just a bit.

179
00:12:06,653 --> 00:12:08,614
I don't wanna go through everything.

180
00:12:08,614 --> 00:12:10,855
If there's, oh, my mic fell off.

181
00:12:14,813 --> 00:12:18,895
I just want to let you know that the slides will be on the GDC website.

182
00:12:18,895 --> 00:12:19,735
So if there's...

183
00:12:19,735 --> 00:12:20,795
Can you hear me?

184
00:12:20,795 --> 00:12:20,875
Yeah?

185
00:12:20,875 --> 00:12:21,036
Okay.

186
00:12:21,036 --> 00:12:26,037
So if you don't have time to read everything that's on there, just go to the website and

187
00:12:26,037 --> 00:12:27,298
you can download it.

188
00:12:27,298 --> 00:12:30,739
There's also comments in the text section of the PowerPoint.

189
00:12:30,739 --> 00:12:33,760
This is the...

190
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:33,980
Yeah.

191
00:12:33,980 --> 00:12:36,161
This is actions.

192
00:12:36,161 --> 00:12:36,561
RPG.

193
00:12:44,695 --> 00:12:46,515
And finally, open-endedness.

194
00:12:46,515 --> 00:13:02,602
So even though we were not ready to commit to design, we already had a direction in mind.

195
00:13:02,602 --> 00:13:06,444
We knew that we wouldn't have universal ammo, for example.

196
00:13:06,444 --> 00:13:09,825
And we also knew that we probably would have a cover system.

197
00:13:10,357 --> 00:13:16,003
But before we were ready to write anything on paper and say this is the game we're going to make,

198
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,866
we wanted to spend time on the player experience before, because the mechanics

199
00:13:19,866 --> 00:13:23,089
would have to conform themselves to what we wanted players to feel.

200
00:13:23,089 --> 00:13:23,550
Yeah.

201
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:24,230
So the core values.

202
00:13:39,377 --> 00:13:42,639
The core values are what permeate everything in the game.

203
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,601
They're kind of a game design through line,

204
00:13:44,601 --> 00:13:46,182
a theme for us.

205
00:13:46,182 --> 00:13:47,182
We had four of them.

206
00:13:47,182 --> 00:13:49,624
It's about choice, obviously.

207
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:52,326
Every choice has a consequence.

208
00:13:52,326 --> 00:13:53,426
Make it simpler.

209
00:13:53,426 --> 00:13:56,869
And make it spectacular and rewarding.

210
00:13:56,869 --> 00:13:59,650
These are not just words, they're intentions.

211
00:13:59,650 --> 00:14:03,053
But an intention is worthless if you don't back it up

212
00:14:03,053 --> 00:14:04,233
with a bigger explanation.

213
00:14:04,865 --> 00:14:07,847
So we had a few phrases for each of them,

214
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,350
just to get a sense of where we were going.

215
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,052
This is the one about choice.

216
00:14:13,052 --> 00:14:14,553
Then there's consequences.

217
00:14:39,314 --> 00:14:42,535
And finally, make it spectacular and rewarding.

218
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:47,397
So these few words have a lot of implications

219
00:14:47,397 --> 00:14:49,677
because once we took them,

220
00:14:49,677 --> 00:14:54,099
we wrote them on sheets of paper

221
00:14:54,099 --> 00:14:55,559
which we stuck to the wall

222
00:14:55,559 --> 00:14:57,940
and we knew that everything in the game,

223
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:01,081
in the gameplay, would have to

224
00:15:01,081 --> 00:15:03,562
follow these four intentions.

225
00:15:06,228 --> 00:15:09,470
Next up, we decided on the pillars we were gonna use.

226
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:13,653
So these are the four pillars we set on.

227
00:15:13,653 --> 00:15:15,014
We could have used anything.

228
00:15:15,014 --> 00:15:17,855
We could have decided that augmentations would be a pillar

229
00:15:17,855 --> 00:15:19,676
or that, I don't know.

230
00:15:19,676 --> 00:15:20,116
What do I have on?

231
00:15:24,771 --> 00:15:26,312
Yeah, we could have put pretty much anything,

232
00:15:26,312 --> 00:15:28,013
but we decided to go with systems

233
00:15:28,013 --> 00:15:30,334
that would drive the player experience.

234
00:15:30,334 --> 00:15:33,957
Also see that we put them in order of importance.

235
00:15:33,957 --> 00:15:37,339
So there is a reason why combat is,

236
00:15:37,339 --> 00:15:39,400
there's more augmentation for combat,

237
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:43,563
and we have weapons and stuff.

238
00:15:43,563 --> 00:15:46,484
It's because we decided that combat would be

239
00:15:46,484 --> 00:15:50,427
where we would put most of our time, energy, and resources,

240
00:15:50,427 --> 00:15:52,708
followed by stealth, hacking, and then social.

241
00:15:57,556 --> 00:15:59,077
Player Fantasy.

242
00:15:59,077 --> 00:16:02,600
Before Mary came on board, who is our narrative designer,

243
00:16:02,600 --> 00:16:05,062
we set on Player Fantasy just to have a context to our design.

244
00:16:05,062 --> 00:16:07,484
This greatly helped us to have a sense of when the game would

245
00:16:07,484 --> 00:16:08,545
take place and who the player will be.

246
00:16:08,545 --> 00:16:09,446
I also get the question a lot, why a prequel?

247
00:16:25,832 --> 00:16:33,479
The reasons were that a lot of people thought that Invisible War was set too far in the

248
00:16:33,479 --> 00:16:33,599
future.

249
00:16:33,599 --> 00:16:37,742
They wanted a game that was closer to today's life.

250
00:16:37,742 --> 00:16:40,164
Also the 2030s really excited us.

251
00:16:40,164 --> 00:16:44,528
When we looked at the timeline for the first Deus Ex, we saw that the 2030s was the time

252
00:16:44,528 --> 00:16:49,873
when mechanical augmentations were introduced and that brought a lot of turmoil.

253
00:16:49,873 --> 00:16:54,276
It was a theme that really, really excited us.

254
00:16:55,867 --> 00:16:58,207
And finally, we thought it would be easier for new players

255
00:16:58,207 --> 00:17:00,488
to get into the franchise, if you don't have to play

256
00:17:00,488 --> 00:17:03,948
the other two games before,

257
00:17:03,948 --> 00:17:05,669
and you just have this one to play.

258
00:17:05,669 --> 00:17:09,690
And afterwards, you can go back and play the other games

259
00:17:09,690 --> 00:17:11,790
if you wanna see how it is.

260
00:17:11,790 --> 00:17:12,030
References.

261
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:17,351
We used references as a common language.

262
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:20,932
It was easier for us to talk about abstracts,

263
00:17:20,932 --> 00:17:24,433
such as mood, if we had references, concrete references.

264
00:17:24,965 --> 00:17:30,967
to use, it was also a way for us to communicate our examples, our ideas, sorry.

265
00:17:30,967 --> 00:17:38,108
So this is our main reference for the game, for the tone of it, and then we had references

266
00:17:38,108 --> 00:17:39,929
for every single gameplay pillar.

267
00:17:39,929 --> 00:17:47,270
And for every reference, we also wrote what we wanted in each, like saying that fear is

268
00:17:47,270 --> 00:17:51,652
a reference, it's maybe too large, so we wanted fear for its AI for example.

269
00:17:58,857 --> 00:18:03,920
So, yeah, social, tone of the game, and conspiracies.

270
00:18:03,920 --> 00:18:08,983
Yes, thank you, David.

271
00:18:08,983 --> 00:18:13,566
Before we ended Conception,

272
00:18:13,566 --> 00:18:16,027
we also had figured out all our gameplay loops.

273
00:18:16,027 --> 00:18:20,950
So, we pretty knew early on what kind of game

274
00:18:20,950 --> 00:18:21,691
we were building.

275
00:18:22,252 --> 00:18:27,374
And for each gameplay loop, we also had explanations for everything.

276
00:18:27,374 --> 00:18:30,536
Just so, there were directions, there were intentions.

277
00:18:30,536 --> 00:18:34,278
I got a lot of text here, I'm going to skip through everything.

278
00:18:34,278 --> 00:18:42,381
I just want to show you the amount of details that we had before we left Conception.

279
00:18:42,381 --> 00:18:48,224
We often hear about projects that go in pre-prod, and they don't really know where they're going,

280
00:18:48,224 --> 00:18:50,225
and they're trying to find their gameplay.

281
00:18:50,865 --> 00:18:54,267
And we knew before going pre-prod

282
00:18:54,267 --> 00:18:56,108
exactly what we wanted to do

283
00:18:56,108 --> 00:19:00,150
and what each system was supposed to do in the game.

284
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:03,071
Combat and stealth.

285
00:19:03,071 --> 00:19:03,812
And hacking.

286
00:19:03,812 --> 00:19:04,212
And social.

287
00:19:04,212 --> 00:19:05,313
I'm sorry if I skip through this quickly.

288
00:19:22,999 --> 00:19:25,000
And finally, towards the end of conception,

289
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,281
we got what we call detailed system directions.

290
00:19:27,281 --> 00:19:31,184
So for each system, we would say exactly

291
00:19:31,184 --> 00:19:34,386
what the system needed to do.

292
00:19:34,386 --> 00:19:37,669
And that was a direction for game designers to hit.

293
00:19:37,669 --> 00:19:40,691
And it was also a way for the creative director

294
00:19:40,691 --> 00:19:44,633
to judge if a final design done during pre-prod

295
00:19:44,633 --> 00:19:46,515
would pass or not.

296
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:49,276
So we knew exactly what we were doing

297
00:19:49,276 --> 00:19:50,517
and what we were supposed to...

298
00:19:51,504 --> 00:19:52,805
to go with each system.

299
00:19:52,805 --> 00:19:56,788
This is the one for combat and continued,

300
00:19:56,788 --> 00:19:57,928
and one for stealth.

301
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:03,693
So already we're talking about feedback and

302
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:07,035
augmentations and cover.

303
00:20:07,035 --> 00:20:07,996
And hacking.

304
00:20:07,996 --> 00:20:08,216
And social.

305
00:20:21,575 --> 00:20:26,924
By the end of conception, everything I've shown you so far, we put on huge sheets of paper,

306
00:20:26,924 --> 00:20:31,391
which we papered the walls over with. And this was very important.

307
00:20:31,890 --> 00:20:34,711
The first reason is that we could not ignore it.

308
00:20:34,711 --> 00:20:39,953
If you have a design that you put on an Excel sheet

309
00:20:39,953 --> 00:20:42,754
or a Word document, and you just put it on the server

310
00:20:42,754 --> 00:20:45,575
and you forget about it, then you're not gonna follow

311
00:20:45,575 --> 00:20:47,876
exactly what you wanted to do at the beginning.

312
00:20:47,876 --> 00:20:51,517
So by having it on walls, every single morning

313
00:20:51,517 --> 00:20:54,818
when we came in, we saw exactly what we needed to do.

314
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:56,739
And also while working during the day,

315
00:20:56,739 --> 00:21:00,100
we just looked up and we could see exactly

316
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,341
what we needed to do.

317
00:21:02,309 --> 00:21:03,429
They were so important in fact,

318
00:21:03,429 --> 00:21:05,970
that when we moved to our final offices,

319
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:07,551
it's the first thing we put up.

320
00:21:07,551 --> 00:21:16,434
And they were there until we did not need them anymore.

321
00:21:16,434 --> 00:21:20,316
So I really think that having this kind of detail

322
00:21:20,316 --> 00:21:21,677
was crucial.

323
00:21:22,062 --> 00:21:25,463
to bring the gameplay that we did for Human Revolution.

324
00:21:25,463 --> 00:21:29,064
We did not search during pre-prod

325
00:21:29,064 --> 00:21:31,164
to know what the game would be.

326
00:21:31,164 --> 00:21:33,885
We did not redo systems.

327
00:21:33,885 --> 00:21:35,585
We did not rethink the game.

328
00:21:35,585 --> 00:21:37,565
We just went full speed ahead.

329
00:21:37,565 --> 00:21:39,866
We knew exactly what we wanted this game to be,

330
00:21:39,866 --> 00:21:41,506
what we wanted the player to feel.

331
00:21:41,506 --> 00:21:46,827
And the whole team was with us until the end.

332
00:21:46,827 --> 00:21:48,568
Now before I go on to pre-production,

333
00:21:48,568 --> 00:21:51,588
I want to talk about the way we work during conception.

334
00:21:53,023 --> 00:21:56,044
We worked in a way we called the creative core.

335
00:21:56,044 --> 00:21:57,184
And that means that...

336
00:21:57,184 --> 00:22:02,066
All right, it fell off again.

337
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:05,847
That means that the creative director

338
00:22:05,847 --> 00:22:07,848
was not the one to come down from the mountain

339
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:12,710
with the design and say...

340
00:22:12,710 --> 00:22:14,170
Sorry.

341
00:22:14,924 --> 00:22:18,467
So the creative director was not the one to come down from the mountain and tell us,

342
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,450
this is the game I want to do, follow my lead.

343
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:28,876
Instead, everybody on the team had a say about our ideas or what we wanted to do.

344
00:22:28,876 --> 00:22:33,180
And not to say that we did the design through consensus,

345
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:38,605
because sometimes people had ideas and they weren't incorporated into the design.

346
00:22:38,605 --> 00:22:42,368
But it was done in such a way as to everybody had a say.

347
00:22:43,518 --> 00:22:47,920
and everybody was kind of equal with JF, the creative director, being a referee.

348
00:22:47,920 --> 00:22:54,244
This meant that an idea would only survive if it was really good.

349
00:22:54,244 --> 00:22:56,405
And it also meant that we got...

350
00:22:57,017 --> 00:23:00,098
a sense of attachment to the game.

351
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:02,439
It was not something that was handed down to us,

352
00:23:02,439 --> 00:23:05,140
it was something everybody had a hand in.

353
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:08,562
So it was a lot easier for us to really pour ourselves

354
00:23:08,562 --> 00:23:11,143
into this game during pre-prod and production.

355
00:23:11,143 --> 00:23:14,184
I fully credit this as a big part of why

356
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:16,966
I think the game kind of has a soul.

357
00:23:16,966 --> 00:23:18,987
It feels special when you play it,

358
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:21,448
and I think that's part of the reason for it.

359
00:23:21,448 --> 00:23:21,888
Pre-production.

360
00:23:26,810 --> 00:23:28,870
The blueprint process.

361
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,610
Blueprint was a way for us to chart

362
00:23:30,610 --> 00:23:32,171
the whole game in advance.

363
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,531
In there you could see all the locations

364
00:23:34,531 --> 00:23:36,672
that would be visited and in which order,

365
00:23:36,672 --> 00:23:39,252
all the conversations that would be part of it,

366
00:23:39,252 --> 00:23:42,833
the choices given to the player and the consequences.

367
00:23:42,833 --> 00:23:44,473
I'm not gonna go in detail about that

368
00:23:44,473 --> 00:23:47,534
because Mary DeMar, our narrative designer,

369
00:23:47,534 --> 00:23:50,594
already did a talk at GDC Austin last year.

370
00:23:50,594 --> 00:23:52,635
And the talk is called

371
00:23:52,635 --> 00:23:54,275
Building the Story-Driven Experience

372
00:23:54,275 --> 00:23:55,975
of Deer Sex Human Revolution.

373
00:23:56,315 --> 00:24:02,919
So if you want to know more about Blueprint, I would suggest that you go to the GDC Austin website and download our PowerPoint.

374
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:12,505
Just to show you, this is half of the Blueprint. It goes from the beginning of the game to about Montreal, if I'm not mistaken.

375
00:24:12,505 --> 00:24:22,230
So it was pretty big, but it was invaluable to know exactly where everything went and to get a sense of the flow for the overall game.

376
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:24,972
Conversation system.

377
00:24:28,939 --> 00:24:34,084
The idea behind the conversation system was to have a relationship between the player's choice

378
00:24:34,084 --> 00:24:39,409
and the consequences to that choice not being explicit.

379
00:24:39,409 --> 00:24:42,952
We wanted people to try and read the characters

380
00:24:42,952 --> 00:24:48,016
and to make a choice based on the character's personality and demeanor.

381
00:24:48,016 --> 00:24:54,642
At that time, we didn't know about L.A. Noire.

382
00:24:56,065 --> 00:25:01,669
So, yeah, the idea is, let's say you have a character with a weak personality,

383
00:25:01,669 --> 00:25:06,572
but he would come at you with anger, then you would try and smack him down

384
00:25:06,572 --> 00:25:11,595
and you would know that he would kind of come back and say,

385
00:25:11,595 --> 00:25:14,257
okay, okay, you win, you win.

386
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:17,301
And there was a lot of tension on the team,

387
00:25:17,301 --> 00:25:20,423
because a lot of people thought that the system was too murky.

388
00:25:20,423 --> 00:25:23,785
They told us, how are we supposed

389
00:25:23,785 --> 00:25:25,546
to make good decisions as a player

390
00:25:25,546 --> 00:25:27,708
if we don't know what's going on,

391
00:25:27,708 --> 00:25:30,569
or if we don't have good feedback?

392
00:25:30,569 --> 00:25:33,191
And their opinions were valid, but it turns out

393
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:36,513
that players really liked it, because they thought it mimicked

394
00:25:36,513 --> 00:25:37,333
a real conversation.

395
00:25:37,333 --> 00:25:39,175
A real conversation is uncertain.

396
00:25:39,175 --> 00:25:41,236
You don't know what's going to happen.

397
00:25:41,236 --> 00:25:43,397
And that's kind of what we tried to do with this.

398
00:25:45,927 --> 00:25:51,652
The conversations were really costly, animation-wise and also because of recording.

399
00:25:51,652 --> 00:25:56,595
So we didn't want to just go ahead, write a conversation and implement it.

400
00:25:56,595 --> 00:25:57,976
We needed to test it first.

401
00:25:57,976 --> 00:26:05,482
And that's why we used an Excel sheet with macros to do the full gameplay before we did

402
00:26:05,482 --> 00:26:07,184
any code or any animations.

403
00:26:07,184 --> 00:26:13,528
You can see in the bottom left corner, the boxes there, is essentially the gameplay.

404
00:26:14,103 --> 00:26:20,345
It was a simple rock, paper, scissor thing where the player had three choices of attack

405
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:34,771
and the NPC would select at random a counter and you needed to guess which was the correct answer.

406
00:26:34,771 --> 00:26:40,633
Is something wrong? Okay. Okay. I'm sorry.

407
00:26:47,099 --> 00:26:49,323
Okay, yeah, it's better.

408
00:26:49,323 --> 00:26:50,144
Good?

409
00:26:50,144 --> 00:26:59,440
So, yeah, attacks and count—oh, a bit loud, though.

410
00:27:00,449 --> 00:27:01,750
It acts in counters, so yes.

411
00:27:01,750 --> 00:27:06,034
The gameplay would check whether you had one attack

412
00:27:06,034 --> 00:27:08,436
that was weak against a counter,

413
00:27:08,436 --> 00:27:09,597
strong against another one,

414
00:27:09,597 --> 00:27:11,379
and neutral against the last one.

415
00:27:11,379 --> 00:27:14,882
And then the rest of the gameplay was the writers

416
00:27:14,882 --> 00:27:18,244
attempting to steer you to the correct answer

417
00:27:18,244 --> 00:27:20,707
without giving away the farm.

418
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:24,069
Which wasn't easy, but the Excel sheet really helped us.

419
00:27:25,540 --> 00:27:32,144
this is a conversation pane. What we did is we would put the conversation in Excel and we would

420
00:27:32,144 --> 00:27:38,128
take the file and send it to everybody on the dev team. And the conversation has a timer so it

421
00:27:38,128 --> 00:27:42,711
evolved in real time. You would have, this is the conversation with Wayne from Detroit's

422
00:27:42,711 --> 00:27:47,454
police station. And you would have Wayne actually talk to you in real time with each line

423
00:27:47,454 --> 00:27:52,577
appearing. And you would select one of the three choices and at the end you would get a pop-up

424
00:27:52,577 --> 00:27:54,758
that would tell you if you wanted a conversation or not.

425
00:27:57,207 --> 00:28:02,709
In the background, the Excel sheet would check all the players' answers,

426
00:28:02,709 --> 00:28:07,210
and then the players would send us back the file with comments.

427
00:28:07,210 --> 00:28:11,871
They would tell us if they liked the conversation, if they understood anything.

428
00:28:11,871 --> 00:28:14,212
Sometimes they didn't, so we had to rewrite stuff.

429
00:28:15,253 --> 00:28:18,355
And then we would do a tally of all the answers we got.

430
00:28:18,355 --> 00:28:22,118
We waited until we got about 40 answers,

431
00:28:22,118 --> 00:28:25,681
just to make sure that we didn't base our decisions

432
00:28:25,681 --> 00:28:26,421
on not enough data.

433
00:28:26,421 --> 00:28:29,344
And then we would tally everything and see trends.

434
00:28:29,344 --> 00:28:33,127
We could see how many people won the conversation,

435
00:28:33,127 --> 00:28:35,528
how many lost, at which round,

436
00:28:35,528 --> 00:28:38,771
just to have a sense of which counter was unclear

437
00:28:38,771 --> 00:28:41,393
or which player attack was maybe too precise.

438
00:28:41,393 --> 00:28:43,815
Because if everybody won the conversation,

439
00:28:43,815 --> 00:28:44,215
then there were...

440
00:28:44,995 --> 00:28:45,836
then we had a problem.

441
00:28:45,836 --> 00:28:49,856
But if nobody understood it, we also had a problem.

442
00:28:49,856 --> 00:28:54,718
We did rewrite a whole conversation based on these results,

443
00:28:54,718 --> 00:28:57,158
but usually it was only parts that we would rewrite,

444
00:28:57,158 --> 00:28:58,478
probably like a round or two.

445
00:28:58,478 --> 00:29:04,500
And once we did the changes, we sent the Excel sheet back,

446
00:29:04,500 --> 00:29:07,460
but this time to another group, oftentimes testers.

447
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,741
The hacking system, yes, okay, this is good

448
00:29:11,741 --> 00:29:14,783
because nobody has ever seen this.

449
00:29:14,783 --> 00:29:18,866
The hacking system also started in Excel.

450
00:29:18,866 --> 00:29:23,349
I had this vision of a high-fidelity hacking.

451
00:29:24,138 --> 00:29:28,140
where you would really feel like you were a hacker.

452
00:29:28,140 --> 00:29:30,001
So we prototyped it using Excel,

453
00:29:30,001 --> 00:29:31,842
and we tried to prototype the whole experience,

454
00:29:31,842 --> 00:29:33,743
not just the mechanics.

455
00:29:33,743 --> 00:29:37,625
So the player was first tasked to select a port

456
00:29:37,625 --> 00:29:39,806
by which he wanted to connect to the computer.

457
00:29:40,633 --> 00:29:45,115
And then the ports would have attributes such as a lifespan.

458
00:29:45,115 --> 00:29:47,516
A port could maybe close after a minute or so.

459
00:29:47,516 --> 00:29:48,957
You also had traffic speed.

460
00:29:48,957 --> 00:29:54,120
The more traffic, the longer it takes to download stuff off the computer and also protection.

461
00:29:54,120 --> 00:29:57,221
So a port with high protection would be harder to break.

462
00:29:57,221 --> 00:30:03,844
And then you could go on the computer and you could see stuff that was on it before

463
00:30:03,844 --> 00:30:05,705
you actually attempted to hack it.

464
00:30:08,258 --> 00:30:10,680
This is the interface for the original hacking.

465
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,461
It's not the one that's in the game right now.

466
00:30:12,461 --> 00:30:13,841
It's our first attempt.

467
00:30:13,841 --> 00:30:18,204
You can see on the left that the boxes are the integrity.

468
00:30:18,204 --> 00:30:20,785
The idea was that the player would use programs

469
00:30:20,785 --> 00:30:22,966
to attack a network's integrity

470
00:30:22,966 --> 00:30:25,328
while the network was trying to see

471
00:30:25,328 --> 00:30:26,608
if there was anybody there.

472
00:30:26,608 --> 00:30:28,029
And if, once you were detected,

473
00:30:28,029 --> 00:30:29,250
it would try to trace you

474
00:30:29,250 --> 00:30:32,712
and then send reinforcements in the form of guards.

475
00:30:33,507 --> 00:30:38,012
And at the bottom we have the three programs that the player had.

476
00:30:38,012 --> 00:30:43,778
And the gameplay was about taking CPU cycles from your computer

477
00:30:43,778 --> 00:30:46,421
and assigning them to each of the three programs.

478
00:30:46,421 --> 00:30:49,765
You had the attack program that would bring down the integrity.

479
00:30:49,765 --> 00:30:53,409
You also had the stealth program that would prevent the network from detecting you.

480
00:30:53,849 --> 00:30:57,715
And finally defend would make the trace longer.

481
00:30:57,715 --> 00:30:59,237
And you had to assign these cycles,

482
00:30:59,237 --> 00:31:01,600
so if you put all your cycles in attack,

483
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,463
the integrity would go down really fast,

484
00:31:03,463 --> 00:31:05,025
but then it would be super easy

485
00:31:05,025 --> 00:31:06,006
for the network to detect you.

486
00:31:09,795 --> 00:31:14,161
That's not all. The player was also supposed to look at a map

487
00:31:14,161 --> 00:31:18,767
because we wanted hacking to occur in the world. So we

488
00:31:18,767 --> 00:31:22,873
designed this map with the red dot over there is a guard and

489
00:31:22,873 --> 00:31:24,435
you're the green square.

490
00:31:25,135 --> 00:31:28,337
And we had this guard just running along in the corridor,

491
00:31:28,337 --> 00:31:30,477
but at some point he would come in the room.

492
00:31:30,477 --> 00:31:32,398
So while you were hacking, there was a button

493
00:31:32,398 --> 00:31:34,979
on the Excel sheet where you could go to the map

494
00:31:34,979 --> 00:31:35,879
and see where the guard is.

495
00:31:35,879 --> 00:31:38,040
And once he came into the room,

496
00:31:38,040 --> 00:31:41,161
you had buttons to change location.

497
00:31:41,161 --> 00:31:44,563
So this was to see if players would be able to hack

498
00:31:44,563 --> 00:31:46,303
while also looking around their environment.

499
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:52,082
And finally, once you managed to hack the system,

500
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,845
you had access to everything that was on it,

501
00:31:54,845 --> 00:31:56,627
but you had to download it first.

502
00:31:56,627 --> 00:31:59,731
So you were waiting for stuff to download

503
00:31:59,731 --> 00:32:01,593
while there was nothing to do.

504
00:32:01,593 --> 00:32:05,197
And this is the result, nice email.

505
00:32:17,457 --> 00:32:19,258
And of course, David is totally right.

506
00:32:19,258 --> 00:32:22,119
This was way too complicated.

507
00:32:22,119 --> 00:32:25,902
This is one of the pains that I used

508
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,743
to try and configure the gameplay.

509
00:32:28,743 --> 00:32:29,864
This is the other one.

510
00:32:29,864 --> 00:32:32,325
At some point, it was so complicated

511
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,167
that I didn't even know what I was doing.

512
00:32:37,014 --> 00:32:40,776
The problem with the system is we asked too much of the player.

513
00:32:40,776 --> 00:32:46,140
Having CPU cycles was too abstract.

514
00:32:46,140 --> 00:32:48,261
Having to look at the map was just too much.

515
00:32:48,261 --> 00:32:54,446
And then asking the player to wait to download stuff, people, they just couldn't handle that.

516
00:32:56,242 --> 00:33:02,866
So but I really wanted that system. I was really fighting for it. And JF, my boss, he had me

517
00:33:02,866 --> 00:33:09,190
redesign it three times. But still it wasn't enough. I was sure at some point I would finally

518
00:33:09,190 --> 00:33:13,413
crack the code. But I guess it never came.

519
00:33:15,197 --> 00:33:18,139
This is a, yeah, you could even upgrade your everything.

520
00:33:18,139 --> 00:33:19,901
You could upgrade your CPU cycles

521
00:33:19,901 --> 00:33:21,502
and you could upgrade your programs.

522
00:33:21,502 --> 00:33:24,285
And the zombie thing, once you hack the computer,

523
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:25,786
you could put a rootkit on it.

524
00:33:25,786 --> 00:33:28,749
And then when you went to hack another computer,

525
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:31,492
you could use all the computers you hacked before

526
00:33:31,492 --> 00:33:34,935
with CPU cycles to make your hacking even easier.

527
00:33:34,935 --> 00:33:38,178
So I was really, really hopeful this would work.

528
00:33:38,178 --> 00:33:39,559
I really wanted to play that game.

529
00:33:44,008 --> 00:33:51,191
Yeah, okay. This is a concept art done by Matthew, our interface designer at the time.

530
00:33:51,191 --> 00:33:55,633
He came up with this simple idea. What if we make hacking visual? I was livid. I hated

531
00:33:55,633 --> 00:33:58,314
that guy for a week. But he was right. And at some point, JF looked at me and he just

532
00:33:58,314 --> 00:33:59,955
he had to grab me from the ledge. I was ready to jump.

533
00:34:09,536 --> 00:34:12,698
And he said, look, this is not working out.

534
00:34:12,698 --> 00:34:15,719
I know where you're going, but it's just too complicated.

535
00:34:15,719 --> 00:34:18,360
This will work.

536
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:19,841
This is the direction.

537
00:34:19,841 --> 00:34:21,982
So just some time.

538
00:34:23,102 --> 00:34:25,383
took some time for me to get around to it.

539
00:34:25,383 --> 00:34:28,485
But eventually I saw that by taking the mechanics

540
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:31,267
we had in the Excel sheet and just porting them

541
00:34:31,267 --> 00:34:35,610
to this kind of display, like the idea of taking over

542
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:38,812
a network by slowly degrading integrity

543
00:34:38,812 --> 00:34:41,914
is how essentially you take nodes in the hacking today.

544
00:34:41,914 --> 00:34:44,375
The idea that you could defend stuff

545
00:34:44,375 --> 00:34:46,116
is also part of the hacking.

546
00:34:46,116 --> 00:34:48,498
So all the mechanics I had done in the Excel sheet

547
00:34:48,498 --> 00:34:50,719
turned out to work perfectly with this.

548
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,901
So once I saw that, it took two weeks.

549
00:34:53,261 --> 00:34:56,783
to just port everything and we had our new gameplay.

550
00:34:56,783 --> 00:35:00,165
It went so well, in fact, that

551
00:35:00,165 --> 00:35:05,107
hacking is the first game system that was feature complete

552
00:35:05,107 --> 00:35:06,668
before anything else in the game.

553
00:35:06,668 --> 00:35:08,409
I think two years before we shipped,

554
00:35:08,409 --> 00:35:10,811
hacking was done and we were playing it.

555
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:11,511
So I'm pretty happy with it now.

556
00:35:11,511 --> 00:35:13,492
I wasn't at the time, though.

557
00:35:13,492 --> 00:35:14,232
Energy system.

558
00:35:14,232 --> 00:35:16,073
Yeah, this one.

559
00:35:16,073 --> 00:35:17,014
This is a good one, too.

560
00:35:23,810 --> 00:35:27,774
For a long time during the game, we did not have an energy system.

561
00:35:27,774 --> 00:35:28,795
Why?

562
00:35:28,795 --> 00:35:31,957
Because we found it frustrating in the first game.

563
00:35:31,957 --> 00:35:36,121
We remembered that while playing it, we were always lacking energy.

564
00:35:36,121 --> 00:35:37,982
We couldn't use our augmentations.

565
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:41,045
The bar was always empty.

566
00:35:41,045 --> 00:35:44,548
So we thought, we're geniuses, we're not going to put energy in the game.

567
00:35:44,548 --> 00:35:46,530
You use your augmentations whenever you want.

568
00:35:47,555 --> 00:35:49,016
But then the takedowns came.

569
00:35:49,016 --> 00:35:52,459
And we saw that players would do takedowns all the time.

570
00:35:52,459 --> 00:35:54,160
There was no restrictions for them.

571
00:35:55,887 --> 00:35:57,529
They weren't even using weapons anymore.

572
00:35:57,529 --> 00:36:02,233
They would just go and stealth and do takes and everybody would fall down.

573
00:36:02,233 --> 00:36:06,877
So we looked at each other and we said, well, okay, now we understand why there was an energy

574
00:36:06,877 --> 00:36:07,318
system.

575
00:36:07,318 --> 00:36:12,242
So we brought it back, but we decided to use cells instead, instead of a large bar because

576
00:36:12,242 --> 00:36:14,404
we wanted the first cell to always regenerate.

577
00:36:14,404 --> 00:36:16,766
That way the player would always have energy to use.

578
00:36:16,766 --> 00:36:19,028
But still people were complaining.

579
00:36:19,028 --> 00:36:20,109
There's not enough energy.

580
00:36:20,977 --> 00:36:24,038
So Jeff would tell me, put more nutrient bars in the game,

581
00:36:24,038 --> 00:36:25,398
put more nutrient bars in the game.

582
00:36:25,398 --> 00:36:28,220
So I did, but still people were complaining.

583
00:36:28,220 --> 00:36:31,281
But at some point I was resisting it.

584
00:36:31,281 --> 00:36:36,303
And the reason is that

585
00:36:36,303 --> 00:36:40,125
Their Sex is a game about scarcity of resources.

586
00:36:41,733 --> 00:36:44,997
If we give you everything, you're not going to think anymore.

587
00:36:44,997 --> 00:36:48,280
You're just going to go and use the simple route.

588
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,002
If you have all the energy in the world,

589
00:36:50,002 --> 00:36:51,884
you're going to use your stealth augmentation,

590
00:36:51,884 --> 00:36:54,007
your cloaking, all the way through the game,

591
00:36:54,007 --> 00:36:56,710
or you're going to do takedowns like people used to do.

592
00:36:57,234 --> 00:37:02,680
That's why we still have people complaining today there's not enough nutrients in the game.

593
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:05,463
Well, if you're one of those, I'm the guy to blame.

594
00:37:05,463 --> 00:37:06,764
I'm sorry.

595
00:37:06,764 --> 00:37:10,389
But I think it was really crucial to how the game turned out.

596
00:37:10,389 --> 00:37:14,673
Otherwise, it wouldn't be a dare sex game.

597
00:37:14,673 --> 00:37:17,857
You would just plow through and it would be an action game.

598
00:37:20,329 --> 00:37:25,952
And I find it kind of ironic that the exact things that I didn't like in the first Deus Ex

599
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:29,534
is something that we essentially brought back in our game.

600
00:37:29,534 --> 00:37:30,034
So, irony. I love it.

601
00:37:30,034 --> 00:37:31,075
Production.

602
00:37:31,075 --> 00:37:31,415
Boss fights.

603
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:33,156
And I'm not sure I do. Sorry, David.

604
00:37:46,543 --> 00:37:50,046
The problem with boss fights, how can I say that?

605
00:37:50,046 --> 00:37:53,709
Remember the directions sheets I was talking about at the beginning?

606
00:37:53,709 --> 00:37:57,412
We didn't have one for boss fights. We kind of forgot about it.

607
00:37:59,020 --> 00:38:03,063
So just, well it shows how important they were

608
00:38:03,063 --> 00:38:05,744
because we didn't have these direction sheets.

609
00:38:05,744 --> 00:38:09,787
We didn't really know what we were doing with boss fights.

610
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,468
For us, we saw them as a way to break the pacing

611
00:38:12,468 --> 00:38:15,570
more than a way to test the player's skills.

612
00:38:15,570 --> 00:38:20,273
That's a big factor why you cannot go through them

613
00:38:20,273 --> 00:38:21,813
by using social or stealth.

614
00:38:23,070 --> 00:38:29,076
We also waited until the middle of production before we actually tackled them. There was no design during pre-prod

615
00:38:29,076 --> 00:38:33,961
It's during production that we we started design on them. So we were also pressed by time

616
00:38:35,757 --> 00:38:39,978
But we thought that by putting enough ammo and enough weapons in the room,

617
00:38:39,978 --> 00:38:43,499
that would be enough for players to just defeat them and say,

618
00:38:43,499 --> 00:38:48,581
okay, that was nice, let's go on.

619
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:53,942
And playtests did flag the boss fights as a problem,

620
00:38:53,942 --> 00:38:56,083
but they did not flag the severity of it.

621
00:38:56,083 --> 00:39:00,084
It's only once we shipped and we saw the complaint that we fully understood,

622
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:01,644
but it was a surprise to us actually.

623
00:39:02,595 --> 00:39:05,176
A big surprise and not a good one.

624
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,317
But, so yeah, I don't really have a solution

625
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:10,298
regarding boss fights except that next time

626
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,399
we're gonna think about it more.

627
00:39:12,399 --> 00:39:16,461
And we're gonna put, they were a big part of the game

628
00:39:16,461 --> 00:39:18,322
and we should have put more efforts in them.

629
00:39:18,322 --> 00:39:19,782
So, truly sorry about that.

630
00:39:19,782 --> 00:39:20,463
The upgrade system.

631
00:39:30,064 --> 00:39:34,707
At the beginning we had this idea that to upgrade your character you needed to go to a limb clinic.

632
00:39:34,707 --> 00:39:38,350
Adam didn't have all the augmentations.

633
00:39:38,350 --> 00:39:43,734
Stuff like Cassie, the sociolog, or the cloaking stuff was all at a limb clinic

634
00:39:43,734 --> 00:39:48,798
and you had to physically go there and buy these augmentations by using money.

635
00:39:48,798 --> 00:39:53,101
We thought it would be more fun for players and would be more realistic.

636
00:39:54,513 --> 00:39:58,219
Unfortunately, we found out that that's not at all how players

637
00:39:58,219 --> 00:40:01,503
want to play the game. What we saw through playtest was that

638
00:40:01,503 --> 00:40:04,728
players wanted to come up to a challenge and be able to upgrade

639
00:40:04,728 --> 00:40:06,311
right there on the spot.

640
00:40:08,510 --> 00:40:13,073
So they saw a big crate or an impassable stealth challenge

641
00:40:13,073 --> 00:40:15,875
and they said, well, I want the augmentation

642
00:40:15,875 --> 00:40:17,676
to move that crate, or I want the augmentation

643
00:40:17,676 --> 00:40:18,937
to cloak myself.

644
00:40:18,937 --> 00:40:21,899
And by asking them to go to a limb clinic,

645
00:40:21,899 --> 00:40:25,542
we were essentially forcing them to anticipate their needs

646
00:40:25,542 --> 00:40:27,743
before they actually needed anything.

647
00:40:27,743 --> 00:40:30,205
And that wasn't fun, it was counterintuitive.

648
00:40:31,550 --> 00:40:36,735
So we eventually decided to nix that design,

649
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:39,057
and we put all the augmentations on Atom

650
00:40:39,057 --> 00:40:40,758
at the beginning of the game,

651
00:40:40,758 --> 00:40:44,581
and we allowed players to unlock stuff at their own rhythm.

652
00:40:44,581 --> 00:40:46,863
But of course that broke other stuff,

653
00:40:46,863 --> 00:40:49,565
like the first conversation in the Detroit

654
00:40:49,565 --> 00:40:51,827
manufacturing plant with Zeke Sanders.

655
00:40:52,508 --> 00:40:55,669
was never designed to use CASSI, the social log,

656
00:40:55,669 --> 00:40:59,791
because we knew that the first limb clinic was in Detroit,

657
00:40:59,791 --> 00:41:01,152
which was afterwards.

658
00:41:01,152 --> 00:41:04,573
So there was no way for the player to get the augmentation.

659
00:41:04,573 --> 00:41:06,034
Now it was possible.

660
00:41:06,034 --> 00:41:08,895
So we needed to go through the first parts of the game,

661
00:41:08,895 --> 00:41:10,156
the whole manufacturing plan,

662
00:41:10,156 --> 00:41:12,717
and balance it in a way

663
00:41:12,717 --> 00:41:14,838
where you wouldn't get enough experience points.

664
00:41:15,739 --> 00:41:22,444
to unlock Cassie before you arrived at the Zeke conversation, because Zeke was already done.

665
00:41:22,444 --> 00:41:27,608
Everything was recorded, everything was animated, there was no way for us to just go back and add

666
00:41:27,608 --> 00:41:33,373
the Cassie support. And I'm going to tell you, trying to balance the first level,

667
00:41:33,373 --> 00:41:35,514
just so you wouldn't get Cassie first, was...

668
00:41:36,115 --> 00:41:38,597
a big, big, big challenge and a big problem.

669
00:41:38,597 --> 00:41:40,959
And Mary, our narrative designer, wasn't happy

670
00:41:40,959 --> 00:41:43,661
because she had to rewrite the conversation

671
00:41:43,661 --> 00:41:46,083
with Vera Markovic in the first limb clinic

672
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:46,684
for the third time.

673
00:41:46,684 --> 00:41:47,505
Balancing and debug.

674
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,205
How did we balance this game?

675
00:42:02,011 --> 00:42:07,298
The first thing we decided upon was to balance the critical path independently from the exploration

676
00:42:07,298 --> 00:42:08,199
path.

677
00:42:08,199 --> 00:42:13,285
So the first thing is we made sure that on the critical path, if you did not explore,

678
00:42:13,285 --> 00:42:16,750
you would get enough stuff to get through the game.

679
00:42:16,750 --> 00:42:18,632
And everything else was gravy.

680
00:42:19,990 --> 00:42:24,453
We used these balance boards to get a sense of everything that was in the game.

681
00:42:24,453 --> 00:42:27,315
This is about half the boards we had. We had six in total.

682
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:32,539
And the reason we used boards is because the metric system wasn't working.

683
00:42:32,539 --> 00:42:36,262
We had one, but it broke down and we didn't have time to fix it

684
00:42:36,262 --> 00:42:39,565
before we had to finish the game and finish the balancing.

685
00:42:39,565 --> 00:42:45,849
I did the first pass at balancing using just an Excel sheet that rested on my computer.

686
00:42:46,510 --> 00:42:49,891
And if I remember correctly, it was a total failure.

687
00:42:49,891 --> 00:42:53,432
There was about 10 times too much ammo in the game.

688
00:42:53,432 --> 00:42:55,532
It was hard to balance the game

689
00:42:55,532 --> 00:42:56,993
without having something visual,

690
00:42:56,993 --> 00:43:00,534
something that would give me a big picture of what went on.

691
00:43:00,534 --> 00:43:02,915
So after doing a first pass that was a failure,

692
00:43:02,915 --> 00:43:05,535
play tests showed us that people were just

693
00:43:05,535 --> 00:43:07,376
gunning everything, they weren't thinking.

694
00:43:07,376 --> 00:43:09,416
It was just a huge frag fest.

695
00:43:10,993 --> 00:43:15,658
So we use these boards, and then again because we didn't have metrics, the only way to actually

696
00:43:15,658 --> 00:43:20,922
know what was in the game was to go in the editor, open every single level, every single

697
00:43:20,922 --> 00:43:24,686
inventory, every single shop, and then pin stuff to the wall.

698
00:43:28,153 --> 00:43:34,577
But doing that, we knew exactly then how much ammo was in the game, how much experience points,

699
00:43:34,577 --> 00:43:40,279
how much, well, pretty much everything. Grenades and whatever practice kits.

700
00:43:40,279 --> 00:43:45,682
And we could also see trends. We could see where we were giving out too much experience.

701
00:43:45,682 --> 00:43:50,385
We could visually see where do we give the laser rifle for the first time.

702
00:43:50,385 --> 00:43:56,788
Or what's the featured weapon in this map or this other map.

703
00:43:57,286 --> 00:44:02,969
So it was a really, really useful tool and it's only after we did the balance boards

704
00:44:02,969 --> 00:44:07,311
that the game really started to take shape in terms of balancing.

705
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:13,654
The other thing I learned about balancing this game was that, as I said, we put in too

706
00:44:13,654 --> 00:44:16,715
much ammo at the beginning and then we drastically reduced everything.

707
00:44:16,715 --> 00:44:19,116
We removed a lot of stuff.

708
00:44:20,081 --> 00:44:22,183
And during playtests, people would complain.

709
00:44:22,183 --> 00:44:24,304
They would say, well, I don't have enough ammo

710
00:44:24,304 --> 00:44:26,046
to kill everybody.

711
00:44:26,046 --> 00:44:28,528
But then again, that's exactly what we wanted.

712
00:44:28,528 --> 00:44:31,891
The first time people went into the manufacturing plant

713
00:44:31,891 --> 00:44:35,914
and they emptied their combat rifle during the first combat,

714
00:44:35,914 --> 00:44:36,715
they understood.

715
00:44:37,206 --> 00:44:40,108
at that time, exactly what the game was about,

716
00:44:40,108 --> 00:44:42,610
and that it wasn't a game for you to just run and gun.

717
00:44:42,610 --> 00:44:44,932
It was a game for you to hide and think

718
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,654
and check out your inventory and your augmentations

719
00:44:47,654 --> 00:44:51,598
to find out, to actually explore

720
00:44:51,598 --> 00:44:53,639
and find other ways to get through challenges.

721
00:44:53,639 --> 00:44:55,721
And that's where the fun lies.

722
00:44:55,721 --> 00:44:57,663
At the beginning, when there was a lot of ammo,

723
00:44:57,663 --> 00:45:00,065
people thought, well, the game is fun, but...

724
00:45:00,485 --> 00:45:04,527
It's okay, nothing much, but as soon as we removed and we toned it down a lot,

725
00:45:04,527 --> 00:45:08,408
the fun factor went through the roof instantly.

726
00:45:08,408 --> 00:45:09,449
People were liking it.

727
00:45:09,449 --> 00:45:13,931
Yeah, they were bitching at the beginning, but that's because they did not understand the game.

728
00:45:13,931 --> 00:45:15,751
They were new to the franchise.

729
00:45:15,751 --> 00:45:20,473
But afterwards, once they got through the first part of the level, they really liked it.

730
00:45:20,473 --> 00:45:24,815
They really thought this is new, this is something, there's strategy behind it.

731
00:45:24,815 --> 00:45:28,037
I got a thinking, thank you for that.

732
00:45:28,037 --> 00:45:29,237
They were really happy about it.

733
00:45:33,117 --> 00:45:33,578
Conclusion.

734
00:45:33,578 --> 00:45:34,879
So in conclusion.

735
00:45:41,902 --> 00:45:45,463
What I learned during Human Revolution is that there is no magic recipe.

736
00:45:45,463 --> 00:45:46,663
It takes a lot of work.

737
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:49,904
It also takes people that you like working with.

738
00:45:49,904 --> 00:45:54,065
We were a tight-knit group and we still are.

739
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:57,806
We have confidence in each other and we like working together.

740
00:45:57,806 --> 00:46:00,707
I think that shows in the final game.

741
00:46:00,707 --> 00:46:02,747
You also got to follow your gut.

742
00:46:02,747 --> 00:46:04,968
You got to pour yourself in what you're doing.

743
00:46:04,968 --> 00:46:11,290
We lived and breathed their sex for a long time, a lot of years.

744
00:46:12,580 --> 00:46:15,582
Also, God of faith is the truth. You're not perfect.

745
00:46:15,582 --> 00:46:18,805
We made a lot of mistakes and people would tell us,

746
00:46:18,805 --> 00:46:22,087
this is not working, and we had to listen to them.

747
00:46:22,087 --> 00:46:24,509
And we had to correct these mistakes.

748
00:46:24,509 --> 00:46:28,251
We could have decided, no, no, we don't want to hear anything.

749
00:46:29,523 --> 00:46:30,824
that would have been a problem.

750
00:46:30,824 --> 00:46:33,947
The game wouldn't be as good as it is right now.

751
00:46:33,947 --> 00:46:35,348
It's because we listened to people.

752
00:46:35,348 --> 00:46:36,890
It's because everybody had a say.

753
00:46:36,890 --> 00:46:39,052
Everybody was kind of equal on the team.

754
00:46:39,052 --> 00:46:42,015
And you also gotta question yourself.

755
00:46:42,015 --> 00:46:45,138
You really gotta look at what you're doing.

756
00:46:45,138 --> 00:46:48,341
Like hacking, I wasn't questioning myself.

757
00:46:48,341 --> 00:46:50,723
I had a vision.

758
00:46:50,723 --> 00:46:53,005
I really wanted to create something.

759
00:46:53,005 --> 00:46:54,887
I had an agenda, and that was a problem.

760
00:46:55,493 --> 00:47:01,800
I wasn't thinking about the overall game, I was thinking about me being finally a designer

761
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:06,064
that creates this totally awesome hacking gameplay.

762
00:47:06,064 --> 00:47:10,328
And it turned out that it was my... it was a good lesson for me, actually.

763
00:47:12,085 --> 00:47:17,107
And finally, the last thing I learned was work for a company that has trust in you.

764
00:47:17,107 --> 00:47:20,368
Deus Ex was a huge endeavor.

765
00:47:20,368 --> 00:47:24,230
It was very complex to do, but still the company was always behind us.

766
00:47:24,230 --> 00:47:31,093
And I think it was very important because had we had somebody constantly second-guessing

767
00:47:31,093 --> 00:47:36,556
everything we did, or just coming in and saying, I'm not sure about this, and I'm not sure

768
00:47:36,556 --> 00:47:40,838
about that, we wouldn't have been able to do the game that we did.

769
00:47:42,145 --> 00:47:43,987
So I thank you very much, thank you for coming.

770
00:47:43,987 --> 00:47:58,939
If there are any questions, please use the mics.

771
00:48:08,087 --> 00:48:21,358
Hi, so I was interested in hearing with you guys how you guys approach the cameras in the game for Deus Ex and Revolutions because in the original Deus Ex I used them a lot as tools during my gameplay to point and look at where I was going to see some of my objectives.

772
00:48:21,848 --> 00:48:25,891
and to get a layout of how the guards were moving around.

773
00:48:25,891 --> 00:48:28,133
And in Human Revolutions, I found them to mainly be

774
00:48:28,133 --> 00:48:30,395
obstacles more than tools for the gameplay.

775
00:48:30,395 --> 00:48:32,276
I would turn them off so I wouldn't have to worry about

776
00:48:32,276 --> 00:48:35,178
them catching me, but I didn't really have any opportunities

777
00:48:35,178 --> 00:48:37,820
to actually use them to kind of scout ahead too much

778
00:48:37,820 --> 00:48:39,922
and see what I was getting myself into after I hacked them.

779
00:48:39,922 --> 00:48:40,102
Okay.

780
00:48:45,420 --> 00:48:47,761
Yeah, we did see the cameras more as an obstacle

781
00:48:47,761 --> 00:48:50,641
than a way for you to see in front.

782
00:48:50,641 --> 00:48:52,302
We wanted originally the cameras

783
00:48:52,302 --> 00:48:54,782
to be controllable by the player,

784
00:48:54,782 --> 00:48:56,283
and it's not something we had time to do.

785
00:48:56,283 --> 00:48:59,523
And again, we're not perfect.

786
00:48:59,523 --> 00:49:02,644
We had a lot of stuff to do, and yeah,

787
00:49:02,644 --> 00:49:06,125
I don't think I have a good answer for you.

788
00:49:06,125 --> 00:49:08,485
It's something we should probably look at, though,

789
00:49:08,485 --> 00:49:09,825
if there are any other sequels.

790
00:49:09,825 --> 00:49:10,565
Absolutely, yeah.

791
00:49:10,565 --> 00:49:10,966
Next question?

792
00:49:13,267 --> 00:49:21,852
Hi, so Human Revolution is sort of unique in that it was sort of accepted by, mostly

793
00:49:21,852 --> 00:49:27,295
accepted by a rather vociferous former fan base, and that's not something that happens

794
00:49:27,295 --> 00:49:28,556
a lot.

795
00:49:28,556 --> 00:49:35,200
And some people have also pointed out that it follows the original Deus Ex, almost act

796
00:49:35,200 --> 00:49:37,401
for act, story beat for story beat.

797
00:49:37,401 --> 00:49:38,262
I'm wondering...

798
00:49:39,133 --> 00:49:42,335
how much you feel that contributed to the acceptance of it?

799
00:49:42,335 --> 00:49:44,396
Whether you think it's a prerequisite

800
00:49:44,396 --> 00:49:46,278
for it being accepted by the fan base?

801
00:49:46,278 --> 00:49:47,458
And if not, do you think it's,

802
00:49:47,458 --> 00:49:49,539
now that you've established yourself

803
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:52,161
as demonstrating that you understand it,

804
00:49:52,161 --> 00:49:54,322
do you think it's safe to move away from that?

805
00:49:57,350 --> 00:50:01,833
Well, first off, I'd like to react to your comment that the game follows the first game

806
00:50:01,833 --> 00:50:02,954
beat by beat.

807
00:50:02,954 --> 00:50:03,915
It might be true.

808
00:50:03,915 --> 00:50:05,216
It wasn't our intention.

809
00:50:05,216 --> 00:50:06,577
It's not how we designed the game.

810
00:50:06,577 --> 00:50:07,697
It's not how it was written.

811
00:50:07,697 --> 00:50:11,620
So if that's the case, it's a coincidence.

812
00:50:11,620 --> 00:50:14,722
As for the fan base and the reason why we got accepted by them...

813
00:50:14,982 --> 00:50:16,543
It's because we did listen to them.

814
00:50:16,543 --> 00:50:22,427
When we went on forums, they were the guys that we were listening to.

815
00:50:22,427 --> 00:50:26,810
We also got people from the community come to see us before the game was finished,

816
00:50:26,810 --> 00:50:28,471
just to see what they thought.

817
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:34,634
So, to answer your question, I think the reason why we were accepted is because we...

818
00:50:34,634 --> 00:50:36,215
First off, we loved the game.

819
00:50:36,215 --> 00:50:38,017
We tried to do the best job we could.

820
00:50:38,017 --> 00:50:41,479
We really infused ourselves in that game.

821
00:50:41,479 --> 00:50:43,780
It came from the gut, it came from the soul.

822
00:50:44,561 --> 00:50:49,765
And secondly, we also knew we had a big responsibility.

823
00:50:49,765 --> 00:50:52,286
In one of the slides at the beginning,

824
00:50:52,286 --> 00:50:56,149
in the direction stuff, we said that it wasn't

825
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:57,671
our intention to dumb it down,

826
00:50:57,671 --> 00:51:00,433
and we knew it was a big fear of people.

827
00:51:00,433 --> 00:51:04,295
So we were very aware of that,

828
00:51:04,295 --> 00:51:06,937
and it's just keeping reminding ourselves

829
00:51:06,937 --> 00:51:09,700
of what people expect from the game,

830
00:51:09,700 --> 00:51:11,241
and I think that was the secret to it.

831
00:51:11,241 --> 00:51:11,441
Thank you.

832
00:51:14,039 --> 00:51:14,639
Yes?

833
00:51:14,639 --> 00:51:14,760
Hi.

834
00:51:14,760 --> 00:51:20,627
Well, first off, I just wanted to say that I really appreciated the game.

835
00:51:20,627 --> 00:51:23,131
I thought it was a great addition to the canon.

836
00:51:23,131 --> 00:51:24,052
Thank you.

837
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:28,618
You know, it's a subject matter that's very near and dear to my heart.

838
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,781
So I have two questions.

839
00:51:30,781 --> 00:51:31,122
One...

840
00:51:31,994 --> 00:51:35,577
At what point in the development of the game did you guys start

841
00:51:35,577 --> 00:51:38,819
thinking about multiple endings? Or, like, how did you go

842
00:51:38,819 --> 00:51:40,961
through the process of thinking about the multiple endings in

843
00:51:40,961 --> 00:51:46,466
the game? And then I also was just curious about how behind

844
00:51:46,466 --> 00:51:53,832
the scenes the relationship with Mary, like, how the, like,

845
00:51:53,832 --> 00:51:57,736
writing informed gameplay and gameplay design informed

846
00:51:57,736 --> 00:52:00,038
writing, like, your thoughts on all of that.

847
00:52:00,880 --> 00:52:03,324
Okay. Can you repeat the first question, please?

848
00:52:03,324 --> 00:52:09,772
At what point did you guys think about the endings?

849
00:52:09,772 --> 00:52:16,400
The process for the endings, at the beginning we knew we wanted multiple endings. That was a given for the franchise.

850
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:19,424
But actually thinking about the endings we did during production.

851
00:52:20,806 --> 00:52:26,111
There was two parts to the ending. The first was, well, as you all know, the buttons you had to press.

852
00:52:26,111 --> 00:52:33,778
The second part was Adam's voiceover that is driven by decisions that you made before in the game.

853
00:52:33,778 --> 00:52:40,584
We were looking at stats like how many people you killed, how many conversations you won, and that would drive some of the dialogue.

854
00:52:41,772 --> 00:52:45,353
We did not think the whole thing through at the beginning.

855
00:52:45,353 --> 00:52:48,774
It came pretty late, which explains a bit why it was

856
00:52:48,774 --> 00:52:50,574
implemented the way that it was.

857
00:52:50,574 --> 00:52:51,794
Does that answer your question?

858
00:52:51,794 --> 00:52:52,014
Thanks.

859
00:52:52,014 --> 00:52:52,114
Yes?

860
00:52:52,114 --> 00:52:53,735
Hi, I had a question about balancing.

861
00:52:53,735 --> 00:52:56,875
You spoke about balancing the critical path first

862
00:52:56,875 --> 00:53:01,436
and then balancing all the exploration stuff.

863
00:53:01,436 --> 00:53:01,656
Yes.

864
00:53:01,656 --> 00:53:06,097
I've had problems in the past with systems that I've built

865
00:53:06,097 --> 00:53:07,957
where I balance for the critical path

866
00:53:07,957 --> 00:53:10,818
and then the exploratory stuff.

867
00:53:11,323 --> 00:53:14,671
and players who do all of it excel way too fast

868
00:53:14,671 --> 00:53:15,974
and sort of break the game.

869
00:53:15,974 --> 00:53:18,119
What did you guys do to prevent that?

870
00:53:18,119 --> 00:53:19,542
And if you could talk about your experiences,

871
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:20,464
it'd be really helpful.

872
00:53:22,686 --> 00:53:27,727
I would say that the secret is playtests and playing the game yourself afterwards.

873
00:53:27,727 --> 00:53:31,788
We did have a problem at the beginning where the exploration pad would give you way too

874
00:53:31,788 --> 00:53:32,768
much so we had to tone it down.

875
00:53:32,768 --> 00:53:40,710
I'm not sure there's a secret answer to your concerns.

876
00:53:42,573 --> 00:53:43,836
When we...

877
00:53:43,836 --> 00:53:48,687
I'm just going to remove myself being naked, thank you.

878
00:53:48,687 --> 00:53:49,549
Thank you.

879
00:53:49,549 --> 00:53:51,574
When we balance the game...

880
00:53:53,258 --> 00:53:59,279
I think what we did actually was that we said ammo would be mostly on the critical path

881
00:53:59,279 --> 00:54:01,820
because ammo was our biggest problem.

882
00:54:01,820 --> 00:54:06,781
We didn't want the game to turn into a shooter, so we very carefully decided where we would

883
00:54:06,781 --> 00:54:07,341
put it.

884
00:54:07,341 --> 00:54:13,002
And then the exploration part portion would be more about finding a few praxis kits, or

885
00:54:13,002 --> 00:54:16,402
finding medical stuff, or nutrients.

886
00:54:16,402 --> 00:54:20,123
So it would be stuff that would be helpful, but not too much.

887
00:54:20,123 --> 00:54:21,563
It wouldn't break the game.

888
00:54:21,984 --> 00:54:24,546
Had we put a lot more ammo, for instance,

889
00:54:24,546 --> 00:54:27,008
in the exploration path, yes,

890
00:54:27,008 --> 00:54:28,709
we would have had a big problem.

891
00:54:28,709 --> 00:54:29,009
Thank you.

892
00:54:29,009 --> 00:54:30,450
No problem.

893
00:54:30,450 --> 00:54:33,072
Hey, in one of the earlier slides,

894
00:54:33,072 --> 00:54:36,755
you mentioned that your core creative team

895
00:54:36,755 --> 00:54:40,938
immersed themselves in literature and games and stuff

896
00:54:40,938 --> 00:54:42,460
to sort of get a feel for it.

897
00:54:42,460 --> 00:54:46,643
As someone who's read like six or eight cyberpunk novels,

898
00:54:46,643 --> 00:54:48,064
I'm quickly running out of them.

899
00:54:48,064 --> 00:54:50,386
Do you happen to remember any of them?

900
00:54:53,645 --> 00:54:55,207
So you want cyberpunk novels?

901
00:54:55,207 --> 00:54:55,367
Yes.

902
00:54:55,367 --> 00:55:00,694
Well, I would tell you that actually what we looked at wasn't necessarily cyberpunk.

903
00:55:00,694 --> 00:55:06,540
If you take a look at the references when you download the slides, you're going to see

904
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,722
we went really broad.

905
00:55:08,472 --> 00:55:13,837
We looked at... We didn't want the game to be informed solely by cyberpunk.

906
00:55:13,837 --> 00:55:20,663
We wanted something... We wanted a feeling, and we wanted themes from other stuff too.

907
00:55:20,663 --> 00:55:24,286
So I did read Gibson, for example, way back when,

908
00:55:24,286 --> 00:55:28,390
and I was a Shadow Master at Shadowrun for many years.

909
00:55:28,390 --> 00:55:29,210
But that's not enough.

910
00:55:31,052 --> 00:55:35,296
I don't remember exactly what kinds of movies.

911
00:55:35,296 --> 00:55:39,661
There was Children of Men, I think, as an example.

912
00:55:39,661 --> 00:55:41,142
But anything, really.

913
00:55:41,142 --> 00:55:44,806
Anything that feels remotely like it could help you.

914
00:55:46,666 --> 00:55:51,628
Go and read it and watch it and just expand your horizons.

915
00:55:51,628 --> 00:55:52,788
That's what I would tell you.

916
00:55:52,788 --> 00:55:52,948
Thanks.

917
00:55:52,948 --> 00:55:53,128
Hello.

918
00:55:53,128 --> 00:55:58,990
As you mentioned that you don't have a plan to the boss fights, right?

919
00:55:58,990 --> 00:55:59,890
Yes.

920
00:55:59,890 --> 00:56:04,212
Have you thought about to take off them?

921
00:56:04,212 --> 00:56:07,933
And, well, how is the process to balance in the boss fights?

922
00:56:07,933 --> 00:56:13,714
Because people who use the stealth mode has a lot of problems to deal with it.

923
00:56:13,714 --> 00:56:14,035
Yes.

924
00:56:16,672 --> 00:56:21,490
Well, when we balanced them, we did have playtests, so we would watch people actually play them.

925
00:56:22,247 --> 00:56:25,969
And we never saw that big of a problem.

926
00:56:25,969 --> 00:56:28,471
That's why it was such a surprise for us

927
00:56:28,471 --> 00:56:31,513
when we read on forums and we read in reviews

928
00:56:31,513 --> 00:56:32,974
that people were getting stuck.

929
00:56:32,974 --> 00:56:36,337
And still we get mails from people that say,

930
00:56:36,337 --> 00:56:38,278
I'm not able to go through this boss fight

931
00:56:38,278 --> 00:56:39,999
or this other boss fight.

932
00:56:39,999 --> 00:56:42,601
And unfortunately, it's not that easy for us

933
00:56:42,601 --> 00:56:46,344
to just patch the game and remove the boss fights

934
00:56:46,344 --> 00:56:48,906
or change them.

935
00:56:48,906 --> 00:56:51,007
I'm not sure I have a good answer for you about that.

936
00:56:52,341 --> 00:56:59,187
It's just something that happened and we, as a design team, we actually were surprised.

937
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:00,368
Unfortunately, yeah.

938
00:57:00,368 --> 00:57:00,688
Hi.

939
00:57:00,688 --> 00:57:01,009
Five minutes?

940
00:57:01,009 --> 00:57:01,169
Okay.

941
00:57:01,169 --> 00:57:01,269
Yep.

942
00:57:01,269 --> 00:57:11,098
So I just wanted to know how much of the feedback did you incorporate from the forums when you

943
00:57:11,098 --> 00:57:17,703
read them, such as like the highlighting decision to make highlighting optional?

944
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:24,268
Well, like you know how you had the object highlighting and there was a thread on the

945
00:57:24,268 --> 00:57:26,992
forum so that really wanted that to be optional.

946
00:57:26,992 --> 00:57:28,254
So you could have that.

947
00:57:28,254 --> 00:57:32,400
And there was a lot of other things that the, like just the...

948
00:57:33,186 --> 00:57:38,733
hardcore like Deus Ex 1 fanbase that were quite opposed to.

949
00:57:38,733 --> 00:57:39,253
Yeah.

950
00:57:39,253 --> 00:57:43,979
Like, so what did you, like how much did you just incorporate there?

951
00:57:43,979 --> 00:57:47,803
Well for the highlighting, at the beginning it was mandatory and we decided to make it

952
00:57:47,803 --> 00:57:52,128
optional from comments we got from forums, from the fans.

953
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:59,232
The problem is when you start communicating about a game, when you start having demos and stuff

954
00:57:59,232 --> 00:58:02,773
where people can actually see what the game is, it's pretty late in production.

955
00:58:02,773 --> 00:58:09,095
It's only when you do have stuff to show, but by that time it's also harder for us to change the game.

956
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:13,677
If people had wanted a third-person shooter, it would have been impossible for us to do it, for example.

957
00:58:13,677 --> 00:58:17,478
But smaller stuff like putting in options, if we could, we would do it.

958
00:58:17,478 --> 00:58:21,080
It wouldn't even be a question. It was mostly a question of production time.

959
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:24,329
But we were really listening to people.

960
00:58:24,329 --> 00:58:28,190
If people on forums thought we weren't there,

961
00:58:28,190 --> 00:58:30,411
we weren't listening, we just weren't replying,

962
00:58:30,411 --> 00:58:32,091
but we were there reading all the time.

963
00:58:32,091 --> 00:58:32,271
Thanks.

964
00:58:32,271 --> 00:58:33,192
Hi, I'm sorry, I just wanted to thank you

965
00:58:33,192 --> 00:58:36,773
for coming out today and congratulate you

966
00:58:36,773 --> 00:58:40,734
and your studio team for coming out of the gate

967
00:58:40,734 --> 00:58:42,115
with such an awesome game.

968
00:58:42,115 --> 00:58:44,376
It was personally one of my favorites of last year,

969
00:58:44,376 --> 00:58:45,896
and probably the only one in the room,

970
00:58:45,896 --> 00:58:47,657
but I didn't really notice the boss fights

971
00:58:47,657 --> 00:58:50,438
weren't that great until people started complaining.

972
00:58:50,818 --> 00:58:53,520
I had a great time with that game.

973
00:58:53,520 --> 00:58:56,862
You had a ton of writers working on this project.

974
00:58:56,862 --> 00:58:57,443
What was that like?

975
00:58:57,443 --> 00:59:00,525
I mean, between the Icarus Effect novel, the whole comic series,

976
00:59:00,525 --> 00:59:01,886
I got completely sucked into that.

977
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:05,389
And the amount of emails in that game, I'll be honest with you,

978
00:59:05,389 --> 00:59:07,250
I tried for the first two hours to read them,

979
00:59:07,250 --> 00:59:09,251
and then after a while I was just like,

980
00:59:09,251 --> 00:59:11,573
okay, okay, collecting them and not even bother reading them.

981
00:59:11,573 --> 00:59:12,514
So that's something that you...

982
00:59:13,795 --> 00:59:18,838
intentionally want to overdo for people that really wanted to get into the sort of the whole side story and stuff or is that

983
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:23,142
Something that you're gonna maybe tame back in I assume the next one maybe and I

984
00:59:23,142 --> 00:59:26,704
Cannot talk about the next one or whatever is gonna happen in the future

985
00:59:26,704 --> 00:59:32,348
But I can tell you the reason why we had so many emails so many books is because there's a lot of story to tell

986
00:59:32,348 --> 00:59:39,093
And we wanted to the world to to feel alive to feel that there was something else going on aside from your own quest

987
00:59:39,934 --> 00:59:42,315
and NPCs and conversation is one way to do it,

988
00:59:42,315 --> 00:59:46,397
but having all this stuff for you to find and explore

989
00:59:46,397 --> 00:59:49,339
was also to kind of immerse yourself,

990
00:59:49,339 --> 00:59:51,660
to show that the world is bigger than you are,

991
00:59:51,660 --> 00:59:53,401
but you are still a big part of it.

992
00:59:54,345 --> 00:59:56,726
And yeah, the writers were great.

993
00:59:56,726 --> 00:59:59,587
They outputted a lot of writing,

994
00:59:59,587 --> 01:00:03,068
and they also had the help of the LDs.

995
01:00:03,068 --> 01:00:04,429
So it wasn't just writers,

996
01:00:04,429 --> 01:00:07,690
it was also LDs helping out from time to time,

997
01:00:07,690 --> 01:00:11,411
writing stuff, and so it was a big team effort.

998
01:00:11,411 --> 01:00:12,892
Does that answer your question?

999
01:00:12,892 --> 01:00:14,212
Yeah, that's great, thanks.

1000
01:00:14,212 --> 01:00:14,452
Thanks.

1001
01:00:14,532 --> 01:00:24,218
I'll jump in quick because there's people behind me, but you're talking about how you balanced each level by listing the amount of ammunition and on the slide you showed how the premium pack ammunition was listed there as well.

1002
01:00:24,218 --> 01:00:33,483
So I was wondering if you could talk about, really quickly, about how you balanced for the optional pre-purchase DLC that you knew that not every player would have.

1003
01:00:33,483 --> 01:00:37,426
How we balanced for the DLC...

1004
01:00:37,426 --> 01:00:39,767
Well, we just treated it as a...

1005
01:00:39,767 --> 01:00:40,107
Gotta wrap up.

1006
01:00:43,191 --> 01:00:48,053
Okay, well, we treated it as a part of the game.

1007
01:00:48,053 --> 01:00:50,674
So we knew we were introducing weapons,

1008
01:00:50,674 --> 01:00:53,175
so we made sure that there was enough ammo for them,

1009
01:00:53,175 --> 01:00:55,816
but it still was a matter of balancing

1010
01:00:55,816 --> 01:00:57,117
for the critical path

1011
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:59,438
and for the exploration path separately.

1012
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:01,638
So we did not do anything different for them.

1013
01:01:01,638 --> 01:01:01,798
Thank you.

1014
01:01:01,798 --> 01:01:02,039
Thank you.

1015
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:02,719
So that's it.

1016
01:01:02,719 --> 01:01:07,101
Thank you all for coming.

1017
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:10,862
It's been my pleasure, and hope to see you around GDC.
