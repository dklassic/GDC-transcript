00:00:05,786 --> 00:00:09,267
Hello, everyone. My name is Yohei Kataoka,

2
00:00:09,928 --> 00:00:12,069
and I am the CEO of Krispy's

3
00:00:12,369 --> 00:00:14,970
and also serve as the director for our games.

4
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:30,356
I'm excited to be here at GDC this year

5
00:00:30,497 --> 00:00:33,258
and beyond honored to be invited as a speaker.

6
00:00:34,628 --> 00:00:39,772
The theme of today's presentation is Tokyo Jungle and Japan's gaming potential.

7
00:00:40,913 --> 00:00:45,636
It's not every day that you hear of a brand new development studio with absolutely no

8
00:00:45,736 --> 00:00:52,641
game development experience securing a first party PlayStation 3 project, so I'd like

9
00:00:52,661 --> 00:00:58,024
to share with you how it all happened, as well as my view on the potential of Japanese

10
00:00:58,064 --> 00:00:58,424
games.

11
00:01:00,106 --> 00:01:02,487
To start off, a quick introduction of our company.

12
00:01:03,184 --> 00:01:04,424
I founded Krispy's in 2007.

13
00:01:13,267 --> 00:01:19,148
Soon after, we signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment and developed a game called

14
00:01:19,249 --> 00:01:20,089
My Stylist.

15
00:01:21,129 --> 00:01:27,051
I will go into the details later on, but this was a become your own stylist type game targeting

16
00:01:27,071 --> 00:01:30,772
the female audience where you would have fun playing around with your wardrobe.

17
00:01:31,452 --> 00:01:32,532
And after this project...

18
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:40,946
We developed Tokyo Jungle, a survival action game.

19
00:01:41,906 --> 00:01:45,089
This game takes place in a deserted, futuristic Tokyo

20
00:01:45,309 --> 00:01:46,990
where mankind has disappeared

21
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:49,432
under mysterious circumstances.

22
00:01:50,072 --> 00:01:51,533
The player will select an animal

23
00:01:51,613 --> 00:01:54,275
from over 50 different kinds available in the game

24
00:01:54,775 --> 00:01:58,058
and see who survives the longest in the vicious jungle.

25
00:02:04,683 --> 00:02:05,943
There are two modes in the game.

26
00:02:06,264 --> 00:02:07,084
In story mode.

27
00:02:08,052 --> 00:02:16,399
Players will discover the truth behind humankind's disappearance, and in survival mode, the goal

28
00:02:16,479 --> 00:02:19,661
is to survive against other animals for as long as possible.

29
00:02:20,722 --> 00:02:25,967
Through online leaderboards, players are able to compare their survival skills against other

30
00:02:26,007 --> 00:02:27,028
players around the world.

31
00:02:29,581 --> 00:02:35,244
The game launched in Japan and Asia as a boxed product in June of 2012 and was made available

32
00:02:35,284 --> 00:02:39,206
for digital download via PSN in North America and Europe.

33
00:02:39,746 --> 00:02:43,989
Thanks to the fans and everyone's support, the title has performed very well, especially

34
00:02:44,009 --> 00:02:45,950
given the size of the budget of this game.

35
00:02:50,152 --> 00:02:52,834
Let's get into the main subject of today's presentation.

36
00:02:54,174 --> 00:02:59,237
I'm sure everyone here would like to know how and why this game even came to be.

37
00:02:59,985 --> 00:03:03,266
and how this was made available as a first-party title.

38
00:03:05,767 --> 00:03:08,507
For both Japanese and overseas media interviews,

39
00:03:08,807 --> 00:03:11,828
that's one of the first questions everyone asks.

40
00:03:15,289 --> 00:03:17,429
So I'm ready to answer that question today,

41
00:03:18,089 --> 00:03:21,730
from how it all happened, how it became a first-party title,

42
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:26,351
and also my perspective on the potential of Japanese games.

43
00:03:34,353 --> 00:03:39,156
As I mentioned a minute ago, I founded the company Crispy's in 2007.

44
00:03:44,059 --> 00:03:46,861
I was only 21 and an art school student.

45
00:03:48,482 --> 00:03:54,105
I just wasn't having enough fun at school, I guess, so I dropped out and invited my friends

46
00:03:54,165 --> 00:03:55,686
from school to form a company.

47
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:03,111
Before I started the company, I was freelancing and earned some income on the side as a designer,

48
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:05,632
designing websites while going to school.

49
00:04:06,712 --> 00:04:11,993
However, as I put in the hours every day, I found myself being less interested in designing

50
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:19,115
what was ordered by the ad agency or a client or a company, and no longer appealed to me.

51
00:04:20,655 --> 00:04:22,015
That's when I had this great idea.

52
00:04:22,035 --> 00:04:23,336
I want to make games.

53
00:04:24,836 --> 00:04:27,077
I've always loved games since I was a young child.

54
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:32,290
I continue to freelance and take my classes, but on the side, I gather some of my friends

55
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:34,892
and people I met online and started making a game.

56
00:04:40,397 --> 00:04:44,700
The game we were making at that time was an RPG called Meteor.

57
00:04:45,561 --> 00:04:50,345
A meteor is about to crash on the planet where the main character lives, and in ten days

58
00:04:51,186 --> 00:04:54,548
when it falls, the planet will be destroyed and all lives will be gone.

59
00:04:55,409 --> 00:04:56,690
The crash is unavoidable.

60
00:04:57,865 --> 00:05:00,787
And the game would follow the last days of these people's lives.

61
00:05:10,675 --> 00:05:12,977
So this was back in 2005.

62
00:05:14,498 --> 00:05:21,884
Back then, there were no smartphones and platforms where you could showcase or sell your PC games

63
00:05:22,585 --> 00:05:23,446
as we do today.

64
00:05:23,466 --> 00:05:25,507
It was a different time.

65
00:05:28,212 --> 00:05:32,677
Although we financially backed the project ourselves, the reality was that there wasn't

66
00:05:32,697 --> 00:05:36,281
a place where you could easily present or showcase your products.

67
00:05:36,982 --> 00:05:42,928
Additionally, the demand for PC games in Japan was so low that there weren't many people

68
00:05:42,988 --> 00:05:45,371
who would check out the game or would pay for such a game.

69
00:05:46,011 --> 00:05:50,736
So if I wanted to make games as a career and not a hobby, I had two options.

70
00:05:58,918 --> 00:06:05,822
And the two options were, either I go find a job at a game company or to start my own

71
00:06:05,882 --> 00:06:06,283
company.

72
00:06:08,124 --> 00:06:13,627
Knowing my personality and how uninterested and reluctant I was becoming with just my

73
00:06:13,687 --> 00:06:19,291
freelance designing jobs, I had a feeling working for a company just wasn't for me.

74
00:06:21,412 --> 00:06:25,775
I only wanted to create what I wanted from the bottom of my heart, so I decided to start

75
00:06:25,815 --> 00:06:26,835
my own company.

76
00:06:27,407 --> 00:06:31,509
However, I didn't have any clients to go to or anyone to rely on.

77
00:06:31,709 --> 00:06:33,950
Financially, I didn't have any support.

78
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:38,893
So I was juggling my freelance projects and trying to set up a company.

79
00:06:39,013 --> 00:06:42,134
That's when I came across a poster for PlayStation Camp,

80
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:45,156
sponsored by Sony Computer Entertainment in Japan.

81
00:06:45,716 --> 00:06:49,478
And Camp is short for Creator Audition Mash-Up Project.

82
00:06:59,685 --> 00:07:01,747
This is the poster for PlayStation Camp.

83
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:09,753
It shows a guy dressed up like Elvis Presley, or at least, maybe it's a Japanese Elvis.

84
00:07:09,833 --> 00:07:10,274
I don't know.

85
00:07:10,874 --> 00:07:13,616
But it said, PlayStation Yourself.

86
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:14,277
Wanted.

87
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:15,958
Talent.

88
00:07:16,459 --> 00:07:16,839
Skills.

89
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:17,900
Idea.

90
00:07:19,401 --> 00:07:24,145
Submit awesome ideas, and we will provide financial and development support.

91
00:07:26,486 --> 00:07:30,888
I wasn't so sure about this guy in the poster, what he had to do with the campaign, and the

92
00:07:30,948 --> 00:07:34,650
image it was trying to sell, but I immediately thought this was my chance, an opportunity

93
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,830
to kickstart the company.

94
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:41,613
So along with my friend, Sumit Meteo, we decided to come up with a game concept to submit to

95
00:07:41,653 --> 00:07:42,513
PlayStation Camp.

96
00:07:49,076 --> 00:07:50,416
We set up our studio here.

97
00:07:51,057 --> 00:07:52,597
Literally, a studio.

98
00:07:52,838 --> 00:07:54,818
A small studio in an apartment building.

99
00:07:56,534 --> 00:08:02,256
For a studio the size of six tatami mats, which is equivalent to approximately 10 square

100
00:08:02,316 --> 00:08:09,839
meters or under 110 square feet in Tokyo, the rent was pretty cheap at Â¥38,000 or about $400.

101
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,841
The next door building blocked any sunlight from getting into our room.

102
00:08:16,721 --> 00:08:22,103
It was nowhere near ideal, but this is where the five of us met every day and eventually

103
00:08:22,143 --> 00:08:23,604
came up with three different concepts.

104
00:08:24,813 --> 00:08:29,955
This was before the PlayStation 3 came out, so we came up with three ideas, one for each system.

105
00:08:30,555 --> 00:08:37,636
The two current gen systems at that time for PlayStation 2, PSP, and the next gen PS3.

106
00:08:43,657 --> 00:08:49,359
For PlayStation 3, the concept was based on the notion that the hardware was going to be network ready,

107
00:08:49,699 --> 00:08:51,339
that you were always going to be online.

108
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:56,381
So once you logged in or signed in, you would roam around space, basically the world that

109
00:08:56,441 --> 00:08:58,921
PlayStation 3 provided for the players.

110
00:08:59,561 --> 00:09:05,683
It was a game that centered around you collecting life logs or pieces of information or records

111
00:09:05,863 --> 00:09:11,484
about other people's activities on the web or leaving footprints on their boards or leaving

112
00:09:11,524 --> 00:09:14,344
messages for friends while you drifted in space.

113
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:18,825
It was like a hybrid between a social networking service and a game.

114
00:09:21,078 --> 00:09:25,563
The more information or life records you collected, the more your spaceship developed and you

115
00:09:25,603 --> 00:09:27,745
would be able to travel to far away planets.

116
00:09:28,286 --> 00:09:32,731
In today's environment, it would be categorized as a social game, but it was probably too

117
00:09:32,811 --> 00:09:33,772
early for the times.

118
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:49,289
For PlayStation 2, we came up with the 3D action game,

119
00:09:49,409 --> 00:09:52,250
where you play the god of rain and bring life and greenery

120
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:54,311
back to the dry, deteriorated land.

121
00:09:58,732 --> 00:10:01,173
For the PSP, we presented Medio,

122
00:10:01,373 --> 00:10:04,374
the 2D RPG we were already developing at that time.

123
00:10:09,456 --> 00:10:11,097
So we had three types of games,

124
00:10:11,697 --> 00:10:14,358
social, RPG, and an action game.

125
00:10:14,986 --> 00:10:19,149
Each of these concepts were developed with the platform in mind, all with a different

126
00:10:19,229 --> 00:10:20,650
art style and game system.

127
00:10:21,530 --> 00:10:25,793
The reason why we went in this direction is because we wanted to leave a strong impression

128
00:10:26,233 --> 00:10:31,276
that our team is not limited or restricted to one style of game or visual style, but

129
00:10:31,316 --> 00:10:41,043
we are capable of developing a variety of worlds and settings for our games.

130
00:10:41,063 --> 00:10:44,345
In closing for the presentation, I included a photo of our team.

131
00:10:44,899 --> 00:10:47,340
just being silly and sent it off to SCE.

132
00:10:49,021 --> 00:10:54,184
The producer of PlayStation Camp later told me that it wasn't just the concepts but also

133
00:10:54,224 --> 00:10:58,187
the group shot this photo that made them want to meet with us right away.

134
00:10:58,967 --> 00:11:03,089
So in the end, both our concepts and our silly group photo made things happen.

135
00:11:03,750 --> 00:11:06,251
SCE was going to fund our development project.

136
00:11:07,672 --> 00:11:12,675
This is how Krispy's officially kicked off as a game development studio.

137
00:11:19,924 --> 00:11:24,228
After launching the company, we developed a game called My Stylist, as I mentioned earlier.

138
00:11:25,069 --> 00:11:29,573
Our background and experience in web designs helped prove our strengths and skills in this

139
00:11:29,633 --> 00:11:29,913
game.

140
00:11:32,615 --> 00:11:36,959
The concept behind this game was to create your digital wardrobe, specifically targeting

141
00:11:36,999 --> 00:11:42,384
the female audience, but using a PSP camera, you take your photos of your clothing items

142
00:11:42,504 --> 00:11:43,865
and become your own stylist.

143
00:11:45,387 --> 00:11:47,268
It's like a wardrobe version of iTunes.

144
00:11:54,577 --> 00:11:59,798
For any fashionista, this was a tool that came with several convenient features, like

145
00:12:00,159 --> 00:12:05,360
being able to view the silhouette of your clothes and colors at one glance, or coming

146
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:11,721
up with a daily wardrobe idea that fit your schedule, or being able to simulate what the

147
00:12:11,781 --> 00:12:17,343
entire outfit would look like using the clothes you are thinking of buying, and so forth.

148
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:24,840
Today there are many smartphone apps that offer the same thing, but back in 2008 this

149
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:26,060
wasn't anything common.

150
00:12:31,743 --> 00:12:36,865
I'm sure many ventures started by students go down the same path, but after we completed

151
00:12:36,905 --> 00:12:41,987
My Stylus, we butted heads and our company of seven shrank down to just two.

152
00:12:42,927 --> 00:12:43,407
We split.

153
00:12:44,492 --> 00:12:47,074
My partner and I decided to make a game by ourselves,

154
00:12:47,174 --> 00:12:49,856
and we needed to convince SCE it was possible.

155
00:12:50,917 --> 00:12:53,979
And so we single-mindedly drafted concepts

156
00:12:54,039 --> 00:12:58,662
to present to them, one after another after another.

157
00:12:59,943 --> 00:13:01,704
I'm going to show you a few of those today.

158
00:13:07,848 --> 00:13:09,709
The first one is called Planet and Baby.

159
00:13:11,728 --> 00:13:19,534
Your objective in this game is to raise and nurture this mega baby who just all of a sudden appeared on this planet into an adult.

160
00:13:20,635 --> 00:13:31,503
The baby will eat his way through dinosaurs, mountains, and vast continents, and it must solve the various problems occurring on this planet to become a fully grown adult.

161
00:13:36,666 --> 00:13:39,628
The next game is called High Speed Hikyaku.

162
00:13:40,582 --> 00:13:43,583
The setting is in the Edo period in Japan,

163
00:13:43,603 --> 00:13:48,646
and hikyaku were couriers or messengers active in that era.

164
00:13:49,567 --> 00:13:51,588
You control a hikyaku, and your goal

165
00:13:51,628 --> 00:13:53,750
was to deliver the packages as quickly

166
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,511
as possible to your client.

167
00:13:59,913 --> 00:14:02,395
And the third one, this one is called World of Colors

168
00:14:04,456 --> 00:14:06,237
and a game where you travel solo.

169
00:14:08,223 --> 00:14:14,186
The game's story follows a traveler who lands on an undiscovered planet and constructs the

170
00:14:14,286 --> 00:14:15,587
map of the planet.

171
00:14:17,808 --> 00:14:24,051
I'm a fan of Snufkin from the Moomin series, so I was inspired by that lonesome traveler

172
00:14:24,111 --> 00:14:24,612
character.

173
00:14:27,213 --> 00:14:32,396
So we ended up with a bunch of game concepts, but we thought all of them were great, but

174
00:14:32,436 --> 00:14:35,778
we decided to focus on this game featuring a lonely traveler.

175
00:14:42,125 --> 00:14:47,007
With this concept, we also thought about an open-world 2D side-scrolling action game.

176
00:14:48,208 --> 00:14:52,470
Unlike the typical side-scroller, you went clear stages, one at a time.

177
00:14:54,151 --> 00:15:00,554
You as the traveler, with a mission to uncover this planet, would explore the sky, the land,

178
00:15:01,214 --> 00:15:04,996
and sometimes even dig underground and go in hiding for a while.

179
00:15:06,737 --> 00:15:09,238
As you uncover the truth, a map of the planet.

180
00:15:09,714 --> 00:15:16,838
starts to come together. However, this idea was rejected by SCE. The reason was that it

181
00:15:16,978 --> 00:15:23,201
lacked the logic of fun as a game, and the system needed more work. So I decided to work

182
00:15:23,261 --> 00:15:29,264
on a new game concept, but carried over the element of venturing a world without a stage

183
00:15:29,404 --> 00:15:31,285
clearing from this game.

184
00:15:38,325 --> 00:15:40,766
I needed a new setting for this concept.

185
00:15:42,467 --> 00:15:47,410
When thinking of this, I was most conscious about the coexistence of universality and

186
00:15:47,650 --> 00:15:48,391
originality.

187
00:15:50,052 --> 00:15:55,515
I'm going to go off topic for a little bit here, but I can never forget the excitement

188
00:15:55,555 --> 00:15:58,177
I felt every time I bought a new game when I was a child.

189
00:16:01,292 --> 00:16:03,032
what made me pursue game development.

190
00:16:03,232 --> 00:16:05,953
In kindergarten, it was the NES and Game Boy.

191
00:16:06,093 --> 00:16:09,273
In elementary school, it was the SNES and PlayStation.

192
00:16:09,713 --> 00:16:11,414
And in junior high, the PS2.

193
00:16:12,054 --> 00:16:15,535
I spent my entire childhood playing with new systems.

194
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:18,816
Every time I came across a new game

195
00:16:18,876 --> 00:16:21,636
or saw innovation and advancement in technology,

196
00:16:22,156 --> 00:16:24,177
it was as though my life had transformed.

197
00:16:24,737 --> 00:16:25,917
It was that shocking.

198
00:16:26,237 --> 00:16:28,638
And at that time, I felt very fortunate.

199
00:16:30,550 --> 00:16:35,031
The excitement and sense of fulfillment I felt then acts as a benchmark today when I'm

200
00:16:35,091 --> 00:16:35,931
creating something.

201
00:16:37,292 --> 00:16:41,593
I hope that I can also inspire others and create games that enrich our lives.

202
00:16:42,233 --> 00:16:45,914
That's why I will not make games that are similar to others out on the market or your

203
00:16:46,034 --> 00:16:47,735
average been there done that game.

204
00:16:48,795 --> 00:16:54,657
Trying to make a game that's just new isn't that difficult, however at times that does

205
00:16:54,737 --> 00:16:56,837
end up becoming all about the creator's ego.

206
00:16:57,617 --> 00:17:03,641
We know consumers have become smarter today and won't pick up something just because it's new.

207
00:17:04,842 --> 00:17:09,045
Going back to the main topic, after thinking hard about what kind of game I should make,

208
00:17:09,285 --> 00:17:10,946
I came up with this approach.

209
00:17:15,209 --> 00:17:20,093
It was to combine or to multiply two different elements of universality

210
00:17:20,453 --> 00:17:23,175
that resulted in a unique but universal idea.

211
00:17:23,955 --> 00:17:26,557
If I take Tokyo Jungle as an example.

212
00:17:30,952 --> 00:17:36,795
Obviously, animals need no explaining, so we use it as our character, and then multiply

213
00:17:36,835 --> 00:17:42,338
that with a ghost town, a very common typical setting that we're used to seeing in sci-fi

214
00:17:42,538 --> 00:17:43,439
stories and film.

215
00:17:44,460 --> 00:17:50,603
With these two elements coming together, we solidified our framework as a game with universality

216
00:17:50,883 --> 00:17:51,864
and originality.

217
00:17:52,945 --> 00:17:56,287
Even though this was a new IP on a very small scale budget.

218
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,461
Because we decided to focus and really hone in on this concept,

219
00:18:00,861 --> 00:18:05,623
we were able to secure the support from First Party as a PlayStation 3 project.

220
00:18:10,544 --> 00:18:12,825
Now that we set animals as our main characters,

221
00:18:12,965 --> 00:18:19,727
the logic of fun in the game that was missing in the previously submitted game concept was starting to come together.

222
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:22,210
These animals live in a jungle.

223
00:18:22,490 --> 00:18:26,751
In this environment, you have to actively prey on other animals, otherwise you will

224
00:18:26,771 --> 00:18:27,031
die.

225
00:18:27,971 --> 00:18:32,732
To avoid death, you have to find your prey or search for plants and vegetation.

226
00:18:36,273 --> 00:18:42,314
It's a very simple mechanic, but I knew I could develop a game system where that is

227
00:18:42,394 --> 00:18:47,015
pretty much all you do while at the same time allowing you to explore the world with no

228
00:18:47,175 --> 00:18:48,095
stage clear setting.

229
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:55,041
This is how I came up with the world setting and system for the game.

230
00:18:57,382 --> 00:19:02,524
And when they came together and connected in my head, the title of the game came naturally.

231
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:09,346
And there it was, Tokyo Jungle.

232
00:19:15,209 --> 00:19:17,549
And now we could finally draft a design document.

233
00:19:18,881 --> 00:19:24,343
Before that happened, we actually created a mock advertisement to get our energy going

234
00:19:24,423 --> 00:19:25,764
and to give ourselves a boost.

235
00:19:26,684 --> 00:19:32,666
In this ad, you'll see the PlayStation icon, the PS3 logo, and the words, Out March 28,

236
00:19:33,126 --> 00:19:33,867
2010, but that's all fake.

237
00:19:34,707 --> 00:19:39,469
I came up with this as I envisioned a large ad unit inside a train station.

238
00:19:40,709 --> 00:19:45,311
From the moment we came up with this concept, the world and setting you see here, and including

239
00:19:45,351 --> 00:19:48,172
the logo, that didn't change in the final product.

240
00:19:51,388 --> 00:19:56,130
Looking back, putting together a target visual and image of what the final would look like

241
00:19:56,210 --> 00:20:00,731
at the very beginning of development was a great exercise to keep the motivation going

242
00:20:00,791 --> 00:20:01,431
for our team.

243
00:20:11,253 --> 00:20:15,534
Even before the game was completed, we created this mock soundtrack cover design.

244
00:20:15,954 --> 00:20:17,635
This is still one of my favorite artwork.

245
00:20:18,213 --> 00:20:22,696
It's actually a photograph by famed Japanese photographer Masatoshi Nakano.

246
00:20:23,256 --> 00:20:30,080
His book titled Tokyo Nobody features a collection of empty or ghost town Tokyo.

247
00:20:31,581 --> 00:20:35,423
Once we decided on the setting for Tokyo Jungle and we were looking for reference

248
00:20:35,463 --> 00:20:41,387
materials, I came across this book by chance at a bookstore and I was very

249
00:20:41,447 --> 00:20:46,449
impressed with the photographs and immediately started drawing animals into

250
00:20:46,489 --> 00:20:46,870
the scene.

251
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:50,468
The image for the game was starting to come together.

252
00:20:52,208 --> 00:20:56,070
This piece is used with permission and courtesy of Mr. Nakano.

253
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:02,232
This helped our team get into the groove of things and we jumped right into the design

254
00:21:02,272 --> 00:21:02,732
document.

255
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:08,075
We probably went a little bit overboard though as the document came out to over 100 pages.

256
00:21:09,955 --> 00:21:13,877
Nervously I presented the document to the producer and as soon as I showed the title

257
00:21:13,917 --> 00:21:15,898
name, bam, it was approved.

258
00:21:16,756 --> 00:21:20,978
It's strange how these things work out, but sometimes exciting ideas are communicated

259
00:21:21,058 --> 00:21:26,081
more effectively through the title name or key message when it successfully embodies

260
00:21:26,141 --> 00:21:29,322
the concept of the game rather than a thick design document.

261
00:21:30,103 --> 00:21:33,845
And I don't believe that's a hidden talent that that producer had, it's the same with

262
00:21:33,865 --> 00:21:37,226
the consumers as they become more selective with their choices.

263
00:21:43,429 --> 00:21:46,331
Once we got the green light, Tokyo Jungle was in production.

264
00:21:48,768 --> 00:21:53,509
As you know, this is a brand new title, and when you work on a new title like this one,

265
00:21:53,949 --> 00:21:58,870
there aren't many games that you can reference or compare to to demonstrate the gameplay

266
00:21:58,930 --> 00:21:59,590
experience.

267
00:22:00,490 --> 00:22:05,311
In these instances, every single person's understanding of the fun factor and appeal

268
00:22:05,511 --> 00:22:09,172
is different because you're unable to have that shared experience.

269
00:22:10,092 --> 00:22:14,913
So in order for a future development team staff and the internal members at SCE to have

270
00:22:15,340 --> 00:22:18,822
this unified vision of the game, we decided to create a video.

271
00:22:19,482 --> 00:22:21,803
The goal was to demonstrate the different play styles

272
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:24,745
and experiences of carnivores and herbivores.

273
00:22:25,245 --> 00:22:26,126
So let's take a look.

274
00:22:40,153 --> 00:22:40,493
Tokyo.

275
00:22:41,204 --> 00:22:46,629
All humans have perished, with only its landscape remaining, the city has degenerated into a

276
00:22:46,669 --> 00:22:50,012
jungle with wild animals furiously fighting for survival.

277
00:22:50,953 --> 00:22:56,339
This is a survival 2D action game where players, by controlling wildlife, seek survival in

278
00:22:56,379 --> 00:22:57,460
this transformed city.

279
00:22:59,041 --> 00:22:59,942
Tokyo Jungle

280
00:23:01,984 --> 00:23:04,787
First, let's decide on the animal you would like to control.

281
00:23:19,711 --> 00:23:24,312
Once you have made your choice, the game shall start somewhere in vast Tokyo.

282
00:23:33,954 --> 00:23:36,775
The animals will die from excessive hunger or fatigue.

283
00:23:39,961 --> 00:23:44,086
The survival rate displayed in the top right is the value indicating this level.

284
00:23:46,109 --> 00:23:49,533
Preying on other animals is the only way to restore your survival rate.

285
00:23:51,977 --> 00:23:53,679
Use the radar to capture your prey.

286
00:23:55,862 --> 00:23:56,923
Now let the game begin.

287
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:10,503
You sense an animal approaching towards you.

288
00:24:12,864 --> 00:24:14,605
Try and ambush using the landscape.

289
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:31,613
It's a heavy walk.

290
00:24:31,633 --> 00:24:33,994
Wait for the right moment to go in for the kill.

291
00:24:35,615 --> 00:24:35,755
Now.

292
00:24:38,452 --> 00:24:40,034
The survival rate is recovering.

293
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,402
Now you sense an animal approaching from behind.

294
00:24:50,923 --> 00:24:52,585
A carnivore has detected your scent.

295
00:24:54,106 --> 00:24:55,748
Use the prey as a decoy and hide.

296
00:24:59,011 --> 00:25:01,953
Like this, the objects in the field can be used to hide.

297
00:25:12,490 --> 00:25:24,477
However, praying also numbs your senses.

298
00:25:44,550 --> 00:25:46,211
What a shame, now you're dead.

299
00:25:47,551 --> 00:25:48,252
Game over.

300
00:25:48,952 --> 00:25:51,193
Your survival span was for 5 years.

301
00:26:01,078 --> 00:26:03,939
After each play, your result is uploaded to the leaderboard.

302
00:26:07,201 --> 00:26:10,282
Marking a higher rank on the board is your ultimate objective.

303
00:26:13,070 --> 00:26:15,052
Choose the next animal you would like to control.

304
00:26:17,294 --> 00:26:23,380
This time, you're a gazelle.

305
00:26:32,007 --> 00:26:34,870
Herbivores restore their survival rate by eating plants.

306
00:26:36,652 --> 00:26:39,855
Survive by eating plants and avoid contact with carnivores.

307
00:26:44,407 --> 00:26:47,888
The Herveyboards radar shows where you can find edible plants.

308
00:27:10,315 --> 00:27:11,836
Herveyboards are able to herd.

309
00:27:13,247 --> 00:27:16,288
Find identical species to yours and form a coalition.

310
00:27:27,893 --> 00:27:29,994
A baby dinosaur has suddenly attacked you.

311
00:27:31,754 --> 00:27:33,575
Watch out for sly enemies like these.

312
00:27:44,455 --> 00:27:46,196
You are finally able to form a herd.

313
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:50,939
Other members will follow you around and serve as stock players.

314
00:27:50,959 --> 00:27:59,145
Oh no, he has been hunted now.

315
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:06,370
But no worries, you can continue to play as another member.

316
00:28:09,992 --> 00:28:12,374
Now split up the group to escape from the hunters.

317
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:15,983
You can sacrifice other members on your escape.

318
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:20,413
They are still after you.

319
00:28:21,596 --> 00:28:23,079
Hide and ward off your predators.

320
00:28:43,940 --> 00:28:46,822
Lead your group well and try to survive as long as you can.

321
00:28:46,842 --> 00:28:54,085
So as you saw.

322
00:29:14,008 --> 00:29:17,830
In the video, the animation for the animals is keyframed.

323
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:22,631
We didn't know how to work with 3D models and animation.

324
00:29:23,691 --> 00:29:25,912
The environment is done in After Effects.

325
00:29:29,153 --> 00:29:31,934
In the end, this video served an important role

326
00:29:32,174 --> 00:29:35,775
for everyone involved at SCE, including management,

327
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,976
production, audio team, and sales and marketing teams,

328
00:29:40,456 --> 00:29:42,237
as well as our own development team.

329
00:29:42,969 --> 00:29:45,771
as we shared a single vision for Tokyo Jungle.

330
00:29:46,411 --> 00:29:48,113
Finally, everyone was on board.

331
00:29:53,276 --> 00:29:55,618
So great, we all know what we're making.

332
00:29:56,598 --> 00:29:58,279
And here's where it all happened.

333
00:30:01,622 --> 00:30:04,243
Our studio was situated in a normal residence.

334
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:05,945
And why is that, you may ask?

335
00:30:06,622 --> 00:30:10,965
Well simply said, we as a company and the project itself couldn't afford to rent a

336
00:30:11,005 --> 00:30:12,846
studio or facility in a building.

337
00:30:13,847 --> 00:30:17,830
This place is 95 square meters or just over a thousand square feet.

338
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,851
First, there were only two.

339
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:21,352
Then it grew to ten.

340
00:30:22,073 --> 00:30:25,375
And during the last four months we had 26 people finishing up the game.

341
00:30:26,336 --> 00:30:27,977
As you can imagine it was pretty tight.

342
00:30:28,137 --> 00:30:29,978
No room for stretching and playing around.

343
00:30:30,659 --> 00:30:35,222
The good thing was that the team building came naturally in this small space and we

344
00:30:35,302 --> 00:30:36,283
all worked well together.

345
00:30:41,283 --> 00:30:45,023
So I want to quickly share a few things that our team learned and experienced.

346
00:30:46,184 --> 00:30:50,284
Specifically, the advantages of not knowing what standards there are in game development

347
00:30:50,504 --> 00:30:56,045
due to no previous development experience and the disadvantages of not having any prior

348
00:30:56,085 --> 00:30:57,146
development experience.

349
00:31:02,907 --> 00:31:07,227
I'll start off with the advantages or benefits due to not knowing what the standards are

350
00:31:07,667 --> 00:31:09,668
and things that were common sense in development.

351
00:31:10,969 --> 00:31:16,734
The great thing is that we were able to approach the game we wanted to make in its very pure, untouched form.

352
00:31:16,914 --> 00:31:22,018
For example, one of the things is having over 50 playable characters in an action game.

353
00:31:22,939 --> 00:31:26,542
Anyone who has ever worked on an action game would never do that.

354
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:31,266
For each character, the parameters are different.

355
00:31:32,947 --> 00:31:39,392
From movement in combat, to area of effect, to jump range, and so on.

356
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:44,382
It all changes depending on if you're talking about a baby chick or an elephant.

357
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:47,243
They vary in size so everything has to be scaled.

358
00:31:48,384 --> 00:31:53,126
To balance the stages so that it worked regardless of the animal type was not only inefficient

359
00:31:53,226 --> 00:31:54,627
but also unrealistic.

360
00:31:55,287 --> 00:31:59,730
However, because of the lack of development experience, we were able to work on elements

361
00:31:59,790 --> 00:32:01,671
we believed our users would like to have.

362
00:32:02,731 --> 00:32:06,894
I feel that sometimes you tend to forget what the users are most interested in when you

363
00:32:06,954 --> 00:32:08,034
actually have the experience.

364
00:32:09,505 --> 00:32:10,686
Who am I making this for?

365
00:32:12,987 --> 00:32:15,149
If it's something you believe will excite the users,

366
00:32:15,389 --> 00:32:18,050
I recommend you at least consider the challenge.

367
00:32:24,354 --> 00:32:28,176
We are also very cautious about specific elements

368
00:32:28,877 --> 00:32:30,618
we believe would attract our users,

369
00:32:31,158 --> 00:32:32,499
help pull them into our game.

370
00:32:32,739 --> 00:32:36,701
For example, we chose the Pomeranian

371
00:32:36,821 --> 00:32:37,922
as one of our characters.

372
00:32:39,307 --> 00:32:44,311
The theory in action games is everything builds up over some time and goes into full gear

373
00:32:44,491 --> 00:32:45,632
when you're at your strongest.

374
00:32:46,233 --> 00:32:48,374
That's when excitement is at its peak.

375
00:32:49,876 --> 00:32:54,240
When the player reaches a point where he or she is controlling the character at its strongest

376
00:32:54,280 --> 00:32:59,224
level, tensions run high, the combat, the action, and everything happening on screen

377
00:32:59,304 --> 00:33:01,506
is so cool and you're fully immersed in the game.

378
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:10,224
Initially, our producer told us to follow the Siri for Tokyo Jungle, but I intentionally decided to go with the Pomeranian,

379
00:33:10,884 --> 00:33:14,145
the weakest character, as the first animal to be shown.

380
00:33:15,605 --> 00:33:16,706
The reason behind this

381
00:33:17,366 --> 00:33:25,028
decision was by using a pet character who is naturally seen with their owners. We were able to effectively

382
00:33:25,088 --> 00:33:26,208
communicate the world,

383
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:28,589
Tokyo, where humans were extinct.

384
00:33:30,430 --> 00:33:36,195
As a result, I believe we were able to attract more users by positioning the Pomeranian as

385
00:33:36,215 --> 00:33:36,955
the main character.

386
00:33:36,975 --> 00:33:42,939
In addition, we included a robotic dog towards the end of the story and also featured a mating

387
00:33:43,019 --> 00:33:43,380
system.

388
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:48,663
These are ideas we believe would appeal to users and implemented in the early stages

389
00:33:48,803 --> 00:33:49,464
of development.

390
00:33:53,967 --> 00:33:57,950
So the disadvantages of not having any prior game development experience.

391
00:33:58,470 --> 00:33:59,131
For example.

392
00:33:59,874 --> 00:34:01,394
Going from 2D to 3D.

393
00:34:02,715 --> 00:34:08,096
As you saw in the concept video earlier, we were developing the game as a 2D side-scrolling

394
00:34:08,236 --> 00:34:08,776
action game.

395
00:34:09,797 --> 00:34:16,238
However, repeatedly playing stages with a similar feel while hunting and chasing down

396
00:34:16,378 --> 00:34:22,200
other animals had its limits and we weren't able to show the variety or different ways

397
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:25,801
of hunting while at the same time keeping it fresh.

398
00:34:27,323 --> 00:34:33,449
The decision was made to go to 3D and as a result we spent a lot of time generating resources

399
00:34:33,569 --> 00:34:34,930
and adjusting the game system.

400
00:34:36,631 --> 00:34:42,016
Additionally, we were building our own development environment and our lack of experience ended

401
00:34:42,096 --> 00:34:44,258
up triggering some unforeseen work.

402
00:34:48,161 --> 00:34:52,805
Our studio was housed in a normal residence, meaning the electrical power isn't the same

403
00:34:53,065 --> 00:34:54,666
as what a commercial building has.

404
00:34:56,968 --> 00:35:01,210
During the hot summer period when we had our development units running, the electricity

405
00:35:01,250 --> 00:35:04,671
supply wasn't enough and we'd always blow the circuit breaker.

406
00:35:05,291 --> 00:35:09,912
In the end, after discussing it over with the electrical company, we had some construction

407
00:35:09,953 --> 00:35:14,674
work done in order to have power running at the level of a commercial property, and it

408
00:35:14,714 --> 00:35:17,895
ended up costing us enough to where we could have rented a studio or building.

409
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:23,637
Additionally, we were adjusting and iterating the engine and tools on an as-needed basis,

410
00:35:23,897 --> 00:35:24,997
so as a result of that,

411
00:35:25,393 --> 00:35:28,795
the tools aren't as flexible and has its own set of challenges.

412
00:35:29,475 --> 00:35:33,937
If we had more experience, I know Tokyo Jungle would have turned out to be a more refined

413
00:35:34,357 --> 00:35:35,297
and polished game.

414
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:44,621
We faced a lot of challenges because of our inexperience, but somehow got to the finish

415
00:35:44,661 --> 00:35:44,921
line.

416
00:35:46,161 --> 00:35:50,463
The release date was set, we were in our testing and debugging phase, and we started to work

417
00:35:50,543 --> 00:35:52,764
on some promotional and advertising designs.

418
00:35:54,013 --> 00:35:59,616
When launching a new title or IP, we all know that it comes down to how you can stand out in the crowd.

419
00:36:00,776 --> 00:36:04,878
For Tokyo Jungle, we design all of our marketing and promotional materials,

420
00:36:05,078 --> 00:36:09,760
from trailers to posters and print ads and media kits and packaging design.

421
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:13,222
Normally, these things would be assigned to creative agencies,

422
00:36:13,402 --> 00:36:16,723
but these pieces are the first things that connect our product with the consumers,

423
00:36:17,183 --> 00:36:22,025
and I strongly believe that the ones who made the actual product can best communicate the message to the customer.

424
00:36:23,663 --> 00:36:29,884
For us, we were able to take advantage of our previous experience as web designers to execute these tasks.

425
00:36:34,626 --> 00:36:44,228
We created a wide array of promotional materials, point of sale posters, print ads, videos, trailers, as well as press kits.

426
00:36:50,050 --> 00:36:52,130
This media kit was a fun project for us.

427
00:36:53,133 --> 00:37:00,055
Inside an emergency case was a towel, a raincoat, t-shirt, stickers, gloves, even a disposable

428
00:37:00,115 --> 00:37:01,435
toilet, a pamphlet.

429
00:37:02,235 --> 00:37:04,136
This was all to get the media's attention.

430
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:08,217
We designed everything that went into the case.

431
00:37:09,857 --> 00:37:14,418
It worked out as planned, and the media loved the kit, and it was the best business card

432
00:37:14,518 --> 00:37:15,339
exchange ever.

433
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:25,047
And we also worked on the packaging design.

434
00:37:31,770 --> 00:37:34,351
For this design, the request from the sales and marketing

435
00:37:34,391 --> 00:37:37,693
team was to feature many animals and communicate

436
00:37:38,113 --> 00:37:40,414
that there's just lots going on in one shot.

437
00:37:41,214 --> 00:37:44,276
They also had specific animals picked out

438
00:37:44,576 --> 00:37:46,397
and had an idea for the composition.

439
00:37:47,017 --> 00:37:49,078
The design on the left is what it looked

440
00:37:49,098 --> 00:37:50,559
like based on their orders.

441
00:37:53,137 --> 00:37:58,200
In designing a package, we were told we wanted to make it pretty noisy and showy as possible

442
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:02,283
so it stood out, and also communicated what the game was all about.

443
00:38:02,703 --> 00:38:03,644
That's how we got here.

444
00:38:04,144 --> 00:38:08,146
But I didn't think the design showed off the maximum potential and appeal of Tokyo Jungle.

445
00:38:09,727 --> 00:38:14,771
So a day before the deadline, I decided to take all the animals except the Pomeranian.

446
00:38:15,571 --> 00:38:17,993
A deserted Tokyo, animals left behind.

447
00:38:18,673 --> 00:38:21,375
To communicate this setting and to stand out on the shelves.

448
00:38:21,983 --> 00:38:25,285
I knew the design needed and had to have this level of impact.

449
00:38:30,627 --> 00:38:36,970
As a result, the promotional videos, trailers, and package design were a hit in and outside

450
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:42,753
of Japan, and we succeeded in communicating the appeal of Tokyo Jungle to many people

451
00:38:42,773 --> 00:38:43,413
around the world.

452
00:38:48,498 --> 00:38:53,839
By this time, our vision was solid, the concept was clear, and both Japan and Europe were

453
00:38:53,919 --> 00:38:54,399
on board.

454
00:38:55,979 --> 00:39:01,380
However, the title wasn't initially included or accepted in the lineup for North America.

455
00:39:03,521 --> 00:39:05,921
Why is the setting in Tokyo and not in the US?

456
00:39:06,541 --> 00:39:08,962
Why are we using animals as our main characters?

457
00:39:09,302 --> 00:39:10,982
We think it's a pretty niche idea.

458
00:39:11,862 --> 00:39:14,283
We don't think this will perform well outside of Japan.

459
00:39:14,923 --> 00:39:17,043
Only in Japan can you sell these types of games.

460
00:39:17,743 --> 00:39:18,243
And so on.

461
00:39:18,856 --> 00:39:24,079
These were the comments sent to us from SCE America, and so they initially decided to

462
00:39:24,139 --> 00:39:25,119
pass on this title.

463
00:39:27,161 --> 00:39:34,404
However, with the buzz in Japan, and with SCE Japan Studios' support, they finally

464
00:39:34,445 --> 00:39:36,446
decided to release it in North America.

465
00:39:36,706 --> 00:39:39,347
Their decision came in at the very, very last minute.

466
00:39:44,090 --> 00:39:47,191
And so the game was released in Japan and Asia last June.

467
00:39:47,837 --> 00:39:50,999
followed by Europe and North America in October.

468
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:57,723
Thanks to the fans and all the supporters out there, for a new IP with a very small

469
00:39:57,783 --> 00:40:00,345
scale budget, the title performed very well.

470
00:40:01,666 --> 00:40:06,609
The critics' reviews in Europe and America are just right above average, I'd say, but

471
00:40:06,729 --> 00:40:12,153
the reception among the users are overwhelmingly positive, and it also seemed like they enjoyed

472
00:40:12,173 --> 00:40:14,755
the game in similar ways as the Japanese users.

473
00:40:15,488 --> 00:40:17,669
We were very much encouraged by these results.

474
00:40:23,532 --> 00:40:28,713
So moving on to my next topic, a few years ago, there was a lot of talk about how it's

475
00:40:29,134 --> 00:40:31,014
game over for Japanese games.

476
00:40:35,036 --> 00:40:39,177
I would always get asked that question whenever I was interviewed by a member of the overseas

477
00:40:39,238 --> 00:40:39,538
press.

478
00:40:40,218 --> 00:40:43,739
There's an ongoing discussion about how it's over for Japanese games.

479
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:44,900
How do you feel about that?

480
00:40:46,772 --> 00:40:49,373
I'll jump to my answer to the question.

481
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:53,256
It's not over, and it's not getting close to being over.

482
00:40:54,177 --> 00:40:58,039
But I do think that our industry in Japan has been doing a bit of wandering around.

483
00:40:59,821 --> 00:41:04,184
Looking back at our past, Japanese culture and art were acclaimed by many outside of

484
00:41:04,244 --> 00:41:09,848
Japan, and the history has been carried over in the form of, let's say, manga, anime,

485
00:41:10,148 --> 00:41:10,688
and games.

486
00:41:13,010 --> 00:41:15,332
The Japanese sensibility is very unique.

487
00:41:20,059 --> 00:41:25,863
When artists in the West were drawing photorealistic style drawings and paintings in the 12th century,

488
00:41:27,564 --> 00:41:29,085
our ancestors were drawing

489
00:41:33,188 --> 00:41:33,928
these paintings.

490
00:41:35,690 --> 00:41:42,474
This is called Choju Jinbutsu Giga, translated to caricatures of animals and humans.

491
00:41:43,495 --> 00:41:47,798
This scroll illustrates animals bathing in the river, playing and wrestling.

492
00:41:49,042 --> 00:41:54,423
a monkey thief running away from left to right, just like in an action game,

493
00:41:57,384 --> 00:42:04,426
an anthropomorphic frogs, rabbits, and monkeys telling a story. It wouldn't be a mistake to

494
00:42:04,486 --> 00:42:10,427
say that this illustration was the origin of manga and deformed art style, and Tokyo Jungle

495
00:42:10,547 --> 00:42:14,388
is also a piece that belongs to this unbroken line of Japanese culture.

496
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:24,937
These types of paintings introduced a new sense of value in the West and were highly respected.

497
00:42:27,177 --> 00:42:30,918
Ukiyo-e had a significant influence on the Western art world.

498
00:42:32,038 --> 00:42:35,619
Whenever I have a chance to look at these precious pieces from Japan's past,

499
00:42:35,819 --> 00:42:38,340
I remind myself of the pride we have in our culture.

500
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:48,682
In Japan and as a Japanese, we have our own uniqueness and charm.

501
00:42:49,395 --> 00:42:54,759
in the same exact way you do in the West. At E3, I remember watching the press conference

502
00:42:55,019 --> 00:43:00,483
and the action sequences were too bloody and brutal and violent for myself as a Japanese,

503
00:43:00,924 --> 00:43:05,808
but the crowd was very, very excited. We were watching the same footage, but the reaction

504
00:43:05,848 --> 00:43:12,633
around me was the opposite of what I was feeling inside. What I felt at that moment was, you

505
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:17,997
know, it's impossible for Japanese to make a game in this kind of direction.

506
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:22,956
Rather than a technical challenge, it's a difference in sensibilities.

507
00:43:24,197 --> 00:43:29,021
There is a difference between what the Japanese and the Western audience feel and believe

508
00:43:29,101 --> 00:43:30,562
is fun and exciting.

509
00:43:32,564 --> 00:43:35,906
But that difference is what I view as the potential of Japanese games.

510
00:43:36,747 --> 00:43:42,151
I personally feel that it's not necessary for Japanese developers and companies to consciously

511
00:43:42,211 --> 00:43:46,395
think about targeting or marketing the game in the West when making their games.

512
00:43:48,043 --> 00:43:52,966
Focusing on making the kind of games we believe in fun and exciting will add to the uniqueness

513
00:43:53,106 --> 00:43:58,610
and originality of Japanese games, and eventually be accepted or introduce new values to the

514
00:43:58,670 --> 00:44:00,972
Western audience, is how I feel.

515
00:44:01,772 --> 00:44:04,974
I think that's been Japan's strength since the ancient times.

516
00:44:09,778 --> 00:44:13,580
For anyone who falls into the creator or craftsman profession,

517
00:44:14,121 --> 00:44:17,623
Your own culture and roots are unavoidable factors.

518
00:44:18,023 --> 00:44:18,544
It's fate.

519
00:44:19,704 --> 00:44:23,267
Tokyo Jungle turned out as a first party PlayStation 3 title,

520
00:44:23,607 --> 00:44:26,869
but it is also a game full of sensibilities

521
00:44:27,789 --> 00:44:30,771
unique to the Japanese, similar to what you saw

522
00:44:30,851 --> 00:44:34,253
in the caricatures of animals and humans painting

523
00:44:34,313 --> 00:44:35,274
I showed earlier.

524
00:44:39,877 --> 00:44:42,598
It brings me joy to know that games and works like these

525
00:44:42,678 --> 00:44:43,739
with unique values.

526
00:44:44,249 --> 00:44:49,332
are released to the global audience and played and enjoyed by many around the world.

527
00:44:52,654 --> 00:44:58,497
We now have graduated from PlayStation Camp and we are working with new partners and publishers

528
00:44:58,757 --> 00:44:59,438
on a new game.

529
00:45:00,498 --> 00:45:04,741
I feel that I must continue on with these challenges that I just mentioned in the future.

530
00:45:12,326 --> 00:45:17,153
I am certain that our industry and market will continue to expand globally and hopeful

531
00:45:17,654 --> 00:45:24,664
that we will continue to respect, accept, and nurture each other's values and aspirations.

532
00:45:25,665 --> 00:45:26,847
Thank you for listening today.

533
00:45:44,988 --> 00:45:48,609
So, we have about 10 minutes, so we're going to open it up for Q&A.

534
00:45:49,170 --> 00:45:51,531
If anyone has any questions, there are two mics.

535
00:45:52,892 --> 00:45:55,533
And if you could just step up and ask the question.

536
00:45:55,553 --> 00:46:08,279
Okay.

537
00:46:08,319 --> 00:46:08,800
Thank you.

538
00:46:09,862 --> 00:46:15,952
I was wondering, are you still planning on making Meteor at any point?

539
00:46:15,992 --> 00:46:24,004
Because Meteor sounds completely amazing and I think at least half the people in this room would love to play it.

540
00:46:49,883 --> 00:46:54,747
I think the question is whether Meteor will be released in the future.

541
00:46:54,767 --> 00:46:55,167
At this point, no.

542
00:46:55,307 --> 00:46:59,310
But I still have a lot of attachment to ideas, stories, and systems.

543
00:46:59,711 --> 00:47:03,133
I don't know how it will be, but I would like to make it someday.

544
00:47:03,153 --> 00:47:04,034
Well, thank you very much for that.

545
00:47:15,868 --> 00:47:21,950
The short answer is, unfortunately, no, it's not in production or we don't have plans to

546
00:47:21,990 --> 00:47:23,671
go into production anytime soon.

547
00:47:23,771 --> 00:47:31,834
However, the idea that we had and the story and the system, myself included, the guys

548
00:47:31,874 --> 00:47:36,576
around me who worked on this, we feel very close to the concept itself.

549
00:47:37,036 --> 00:47:44,019
So I'm not sure how or when or why or, you know, in what form it will come in, but I'm

550
00:47:44,139 --> 00:47:44,699
sure that

551
00:47:45,146 --> 00:47:49,247
We will continue to be inspired by where it all started.

552
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:54,049
You get to make it someday.

553
00:48:08,825 --> 00:48:16,647
You design the game. Have you worried that the style is so unique that maybe only a few people love it?

554
00:48:17,408 --> 00:48:24,330
And that you cannot make enough money to support your team and maybe it will fail?

555
00:48:24,350 --> 00:48:36,134
Thank you

556
00:48:36,214 --> 00:48:36,654
Can you hear me

557
00:48:39,517 --> 00:48:46,943
I missed the first part. Is the question that Tokyo Jungle is so unique that if it doesn't

558
00:48:47,023 --> 00:48:49,986
generate enough sales that you won't make enough money to support the team?

559
00:48:51,287 --> 00:48:59,313
Yes, when he designed the game he worried that the style is so unique that maybe only

560
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:04,637
a few people in the market like it and he will not make enough money to support his

561
00:49:04,697 --> 00:49:04,878
team.

562
00:49:11,270 --> 00:49:12,551
Okay, got it. Thank you.

563
00:49:51,554 --> 00:49:57,240
the publisher's rating and sales will drop if you make a new game?

564
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:59,222
I think that things are slow-moving.

565
00:50:15,802 --> 00:50:20,365
I think that it is more likely to win a prize if we use our new title idea, which we think is interesting,

566
00:50:20,405 --> 00:50:23,047
rather than making a game with a similar system.

567
00:50:23,107 --> 00:50:28,690
Especially for small-scale independent development companies like us,

568
00:50:29,071 --> 00:50:30,031
that is our value.

569
00:50:30,051 --> 00:50:30,892
We are aware of that.

570
00:50:30,912 --> 00:50:34,474
We will continue to work hard in that direction.

571
00:50:43,950 --> 00:50:51,217
For now, I think most people may feel the same way too, because we're so unique, the ideas are so unique and so out there.

572
00:50:52,578 --> 00:50:58,644
But we feel that that in the end is actually our character.

573
00:50:58,744 --> 00:51:07,692
It's our best element for such a small development studio, that it's basically that becomes our best weapon.

574
00:51:08,453 --> 00:51:10,014
And in today's market.

575
00:51:10,595 --> 00:51:17,696
it's so easy to say, hey, let's make a sequel, but that's not exactly what my direction is when

576
00:51:17,776 --> 00:51:25,038
coming up with brand new ideas. I continuously want to come up with brand new ideas to differentiate

577
00:51:25,138 --> 00:51:31,600
ourselves from, say, another development company that will, you know, roll in their resources to

578
00:51:31,620 --> 00:51:34,700
the next sequel and to a series and so forth. So,

579
00:51:36,015 --> 00:51:43,016
We want to be different in that way and so it becomes our best asset that we come up with these very different unique ideas.

580
00:51:47,777 --> 00:51:58,379
Tokyo Jungle doesn't sell well. Will you continue to make this kind of game or maybe you will try some other things that are popular? Thank you.

581
00:52:31,230 --> 00:52:34,053
When someone says, a headhunter jungle had never been selling,

582
00:52:34,073 --> 00:52:35,915
will they continue to develop the headquarters?

583
00:52:36,416 --> 00:52:38,418
I think this is a really good question.

584
00:52:38,438 --> 00:52:38,538
Hmmmm...

585
00:52:38,598 --> 00:52:39,179
I've got no idea.

586
00:52:47,442 --> 00:52:48,943
I've never imagined such a situation.

587
00:52:49,023 --> 00:52:53,164
I feel very motivated to realize what I want to create and my ideas.

588
00:52:53,204 --> 00:52:55,485
If it's not evaluated in the game, I think I'll challenge other media.

589
00:52:56,125 --> 00:52:57,025
You know, to be completely honest,

590
00:52:57,105 --> 00:52:59,486
I am not able to answer that question in a way that

591
00:53:15,958 --> 00:53:26,004
I can't say that I've even thought about that. So to me, wanting to make my our unique ideas,

592
00:53:26,424 --> 00:53:33,308
concepts that we come up with into a game form is sort of the single and sole direction that we have

593
00:53:33,368 --> 00:53:42,293
right now. And if we don't succeed at all with any of our game ideas, then I think at that point in

594
00:53:42,353 --> 00:53:43,093
time it's...

595
00:53:43,507 --> 00:53:49,029
It's for me to say maybe games is not the media that I need to translate my ideas into

596
00:53:49,529 --> 00:53:55,152
and that I would maybe move on to a different type of medium to communicate my ideas.

597
00:53:59,274 --> 00:54:08,498
And your team will make good in the future. Thank you.

598
00:54:13,061 --> 00:54:23,768
I'm sorry, but recently there was a BitSummit, but there is an image that there is no indie community in Japan.

599
00:54:23,788 --> 00:54:23,888
Yes.

600
00:54:23,908 --> 00:54:29,851
Why is that? How can we become a little stronger in the community?

601
00:54:30,432 --> 00:54:30,552
Yes.

602
00:54:30,572 --> 00:54:31,813
This is...

603
00:54:31,873 --> 00:54:32,973
Ah, sorry, I'll do it myself.

604
00:54:33,173 --> 00:54:33,314
Yes.

605
00:54:44,422 --> 00:55:03,672
So the question was, is that recently in Japan, in Kyoto, there was a event or conference called Bit Summit, which is basically the premise was to promote and spread the word about Japanese indie game development.

606
00:55:04,180 --> 00:55:15,167
developers and sort of grow that community. And his question to Kataoka-san is, is why do you think that the Japanese indie game development community is so small right now?

607
00:55:15,247 --> 00:55:20,550
And how, how do you feel that, you know, which way will go and how will it grow in the future?

608
00:55:31,423 --> 00:55:32,464
I was in an art school.

609
00:55:32,484 --> 00:55:36,447
There were a lot of young people who wanted to make games.

610
00:55:36,467 --> 00:55:40,691
Their ultimate goal was to join a large game development company.

611
00:55:40,711 --> 00:55:45,015
I don't think the goals of students and young people who want to make games have changed much.

612
00:55:45,095 --> 00:55:47,377
I think that's the biggest reason.

613
00:55:58,884 --> 00:56:04,686
What motivated us to develop Yeshina Galaxy was the fact that we wanted to make games ourselves.

614
00:56:04,786 --> 00:56:10,007
We chose the company who supported the development of the game and made it there.

615
00:56:12,988 --> 00:56:14,768
Although we developed ways to work independently,

616
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:20,470
such as through apps like Steam, Apple Store, and the Android market,

617
00:56:20,490 --> 00:56:24,551
we weren't quite successful in Japan.

618
00:56:36,457 --> 00:56:42,901
So going from my own experience, I was an art school student and you know around me including myself there were a lot of

619
00:56:43,961 --> 00:56:48,364
There are a lot of students who wanted to make games, but I think in general

620
00:56:48,384 --> 00:56:55,908
a lot of the students their final goal is to make games meaning that they would go find a job at a

621
00:56:56,796 --> 00:57:02,980
already existing, you know, large game development company or publisher. And those goals haven't,

622
00:57:03,500 --> 00:57:09,403
they haven't really changed. Now is the time for, you know, if you want to take a risk and

623
00:57:09,683 --> 00:57:16,587
challenge yourself, it is a great time to kind of go independent. But because of the majority of the,

624
00:57:17,208 --> 00:57:24,312
how, you know, the students are not going in that kind of going in the route, it hasn't really helped

625
00:57:24,492 --> 00:57:26,173
the indie community grow.

626
00:57:27,004 --> 00:57:32,388
and it's sort of had this not restriction or borderline, but the framework just hasn't grown

627
00:57:32,508 --> 00:57:40,413
into something that maybe you guys would expect to see in Japan. So since now that there's apps

628
00:57:40,614 --> 00:57:45,197
you can make by yourself or with just a few friends, and there are so many platforms out

629
00:57:45,237 --> 00:57:50,680
there that you can distribute your content, I would think that we want to encourage ourselves

630
00:57:50,780 --> 00:57:54,063
to maybe go independent and take that challenge.

631
00:58:00,172 --> 00:58:07,441
Okay, so time is actually up, so we've been told that we will not be able to take any

632
00:58:07,461 --> 00:58:08,162
more questions.

633
00:58:08,222 --> 00:58:11,106
I'm so sorry, but we're going to have to close this session.

634
00:58:11,666 --> 00:58:12,307
Thank you, everyone.

635
00:58:12,327 --> 00:58:12,527
Thank you.

636
00:58:12,587 --> 00:58:13,028
Thank you.

637
00:58:13,048 --> 00:58:14,870
Thank you.

638
00:58:14,890 --> 00:58:15,070
Thank you.

639
00:58:15,090 --> 00:58:15,271
Thank you.

640
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:15,471
Thank you.

641
00:58:15,491 --> 00:58:15,671
Thank you.

642
00:58:15,691 --> 00:58:15,871
Thank you.

643
00:58:15,891 --> 00:58:16,072
Thank you.

644
00:58:16,092 --> 00:58:16,272
Thank you.

645
00:58:16,292 --> 00:58:16,472
Thank you.

646
00:58:16,492 --> 00:58:16,712
Thank you.

647
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:16,933
Thank you.

648
00:58:16,953 --> 00:58:17,133
Thank you.
