1
00:00:05,290 --> 00:00:07,392
I have this friend, he's a game artist,

2
00:00:07,392 --> 00:00:08,993
a brilliant freaking game artist

3
00:00:08,993 --> 00:00:11,035
and an inspiration to everyone around him.

4
00:00:11,035 --> 00:00:12,956
And he went to the doctor recently

5
00:00:12,956 --> 00:00:15,278
and the doctor told him that if he keeps doing

6
00:00:15,278 --> 00:00:16,999
what he's doing for a living,

7
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,321
he's gonna keel over and die from a heart attack

8
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,723
in the next couple of years.

9
00:00:21,723 --> 00:00:23,624
How fucked up is that?

10
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:29,463
And the scariest part about that story is that I'm pretty sure every single one of you guys

11
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:34,646
haven't been in this industry for a while has a similar one about someone you know or

12
00:00:34,646 --> 00:00:36,107
maybe even you.

13
00:00:36,107 --> 00:00:40,450
And I for one have sat through way too many friends literally with tears in their eyes

14
00:00:40,450 --> 00:00:45,013
telling me that they are probably going to have to leave the job that they love and their

15
00:00:45,013 --> 00:00:48,576
friends behind because if they don't they might not have a family anymore.

16
00:00:49,256 --> 00:00:53,221
And it boggles my mind that we somehow ended up here.

17
00:00:53,221 --> 00:00:55,804
That is our reality in many ways,

18
00:00:55,804 --> 00:00:58,567
because we're not in open sea hunting whales,

19
00:00:58,567 --> 00:01:02,552
and we're not in mines breathing in coal and dust.

20
00:01:02,552 --> 00:01:05,335
It's somehow we ended up here.

21
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:06,216
And I'm very lucky.

22
00:01:06,216 --> 00:01:08,619
I get to travel the world, talk to game developers about.

23
00:01:08,639 --> 00:01:15,283
what they worry about and I get to hear all kinds of things from absolutely mind boggling like you know HR department starting

24
00:01:15,283 --> 00:01:23,789
betting pools on how many divorces they're going to get after after the product ships to to the very worst one that I've heard

25
00:01:23,789 --> 00:01:31,374
is actually a senior artist teaching their younglings at a studio that in order to survive in this industry you need to learn

26
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:32,294
how to care less.

27
00:01:33,259 --> 00:01:36,641
which breaks my heart on so many, many levels.

28
00:01:36,641 --> 00:01:40,485
Because something that all of us are extremely privileged

29
00:01:40,485 --> 00:01:42,066
with in this room right now,

30
00:01:42,066 --> 00:01:44,028
is that we actually have something

31
00:01:44,028 --> 00:01:45,529
that we love doing for a living.

32
00:01:45,529 --> 00:01:47,571
And it's a privilege that most people

33
00:01:47,571 --> 00:01:49,713
will actually never know in their freaking life.

34
00:01:49,713 --> 00:01:52,035
They'll just go to work, spend a third of their life

35
00:01:52,035 --> 00:01:54,016
doing something absolutely loathing what they do,

36
00:01:54,016 --> 00:01:56,819
and then just waiting for that clock to run out

37
00:01:56,819 --> 00:01:58,700
to actually go home and do something that they love.

38
00:01:58,700 --> 00:02:00,502
And the fact that we have to

39
00:02:01,082 --> 00:02:06,488
condition people to learn to love something less so that it doesn't have to hurt them back is

40
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:11,353
absolutely mind-blowing to me and deeply disheartening and

41
00:02:11,353 --> 00:02:16,718
That kind of shit keeps me up at night and all of you guys keep me up at night because I've I I've met you

42
00:02:16,718 --> 00:02:22,083
I've been to many a GDC's and conferences and and I know for a fact that

43
00:02:22,304 --> 00:02:28,726
pretty much all of you have dedicated most of your life to building beautiful things that will entertain people and take them on

44
00:02:28,726 --> 00:02:35,730
adventures and share stories and give them memories and friends they wouldn't have had otherwise. And to think that this is how

45
00:02:35,730 --> 00:02:41,892
we treat people as an industry like this is the best we can do. And the worst part is usually that the most burnout are

46
00:02:41,892 --> 00:02:45,054
usually the people who actually give away most which is even more heartbreaking.

47
00:02:45,855 --> 00:02:48,477
And honestly, this is why there's an AI talk

48
00:02:48,477 --> 00:02:50,419
in the middle of an art direction bootcamp,

49
00:02:50,419 --> 00:02:53,181
is because trying to solve this problem

50
00:02:53,181 --> 00:02:56,244
for many, many years, I do not know a better way

51
00:02:56,244 --> 00:02:59,107
to fix a lot of the things that are symptomatic of this,

52
00:02:59,107 --> 00:03:00,147
rather than technology.

53
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:03,069
You know, yes, there's talk about unionizing, great,

54
00:03:03,069 --> 00:03:05,169
but games are still ridiculously expensive to make.

55
00:03:05,169 --> 00:03:06,570
You still have gigantic teams

56
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:08,370
that we financially cannot justify,

57
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:10,311
and we're gonna have to outsource more jobs

58
00:03:10,311 --> 00:03:12,331
once the next console generation comes around,

59
00:03:12,331 --> 00:03:15,192
and then how creatively engaged are you going to be?

60
00:03:15,192 --> 00:03:17,073
And then, you know, on top of that,

61
00:03:17,073 --> 00:03:18,653
even if all the jobs are here,

62
00:03:18,653 --> 00:03:20,494
but there are 3,000 of us making one game,

63
00:03:20,494 --> 00:03:23,335
how exciting is it to place rock by a tree for a year,

64
00:03:23,335 --> 00:03:24,635
because that's all you get to do?

65
00:03:26,023 --> 00:03:29,485
Because it's the quality and the dignity of the jobs that matters also.

66
00:03:29,485 --> 00:03:36,047
And, you know, it's the crunch and the cost and the creative ownership and all of that.

67
00:03:36,047 --> 00:03:40,428
And I can't think of a better way to fix it than literally make everyone 10 times more powerful

68
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:44,530
than they are today. Making sure that you can accomplish a lot more than you think you can.

69
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:49,792
Making sure that whatever is out there does not require an army of craftsmen,

70
00:03:49,792 --> 00:03:52,453
but rather a tight-knit group of artists.

71
00:03:52,953 --> 00:03:55,155
And that is what we're going to try to talk about today.

72
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:57,296
This is obviously a talk about technology.

73
00:03:57,296 --> 00:03:58,737
There's going to be a bunch of technical things.

74
00:03:58,737 --> 00:04:01,740
But fundamentally, it's about you.

75
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,921
It's not about trying to tell you, hey,

76
00:04:03,921 --> 00:04:05,162
a bunch of programmers got together,

77
00:04:05,162 --> 00:04:06,323
and we figured this thing out.

78
00:04:06,323 --> 00:04:07,624
So now all of you got to live with it.

79
00:04:07,624 --> 00:04:08,865
It's the exact opposite of that.

80
00:04:08,865 --> 00:04:12,448
It's, hey, all of these people are doing all of these things.

81
00:04:12,448 --> 00:04:14,690
And quite frankly, nobody has a clue.

82
00:04:15,550 --> 00:04:19,332
Nobody has a clue apart from you because this has all been made for you.

83
00:04:19,332 --> 00:04:24,393
And in order for you to make the most of it, you need to be vocal, you need to be educated,

84
00:04:24,393 --> 00:04:26,034
you need to be a part of that conversation.

85
00:04:26,034 --> 00:04:30,395
And in order to do that, you need the ammunition, you need the knowledge to actually call bullshit

86
00:04:30,395 --> 00:04:35,237
when somebody gives you technology that is undeserving of the creativity that you possess.

87
00:04:35,237 --> 00:04:37,798
And so that's what we're going to talk about.

88
00:04:37,798 --> 00:04:40,518
And I know right now you're thinking, God damn it, Andrew, how the hell are you going

89
00:04:40,518 --> 00:04:42,379
to dig the presentation out of this hole?

90
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:45,962
And I'm not sure, but we're going to try.

91
00:04:45,962 --> 00:04:48,384
We're going to try together, because the presentation is

92
00:04:48,384 --> 00:04:49,065
actually pretty fun.

93
00:04:49,065 --> 00:04:51,547
We have videos, we have robots, there's a dance break

94
00:04:51,547 --> 00:04:53,669
in the middle, so it should hopefully go quite well.

95
00:04:53,669 --> 00:04:54,550
And so, all right, here goes.

96
00:04:54,550 --> 00:04:58,754
Building a creative future with artificial intelligence.

97
00:04:58,754 --> 00:05:02,197
And I'm going to start with a very simple, aspirational

98
00:05:02,197 --> 00:05:05,140
video, because I think something that is very

99
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,060
important is that.

100
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:12,729
I think culturally, we all realize that there is a certain critical mass of technology that

101
00:05:12,729 --> 00:05:18,192
is going to happen that is essentially going to make every single person the master and

102
00:05:18,192 --> 00:05:19,813
creator of entire universes.

103
00:05:19,813 --> 00:05:23,895
And it's been in popular culture for the longest time, and this is obviously the newest Blade

104
00:05:23,895 --> 00:05:29,419
Runner movie, with the sort of section about mutant memories.

105
00:05:29,419 --> 00:05:31,100
But, I think conceptually...

106
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:41,283
What is really important is that we knew for a while that we're going to get there anyway.

107
00:05:41,283 --> 00:05:45,426
And I think that is the tricky part because it's very hard for us to reconcile all the

108
00:05:45,426 --> 00:05:49,969
science fiction we've been brought up with with the actual time in our lives when we see that

109
00:05:49,969 --> 00:05:53,532
science fiction become a reality. And then all of a sudden we go, wait, what do you mean I don't get

110
00:05:53,532 --> 00:05:57,915
to make my own laws? You know, it's and so that is kind of mind boggling. And we're going to try to

111
00:05:57,915 --> 00:06:01,077
talk about this a little better today. But we're going to start a little bit further. We're going

112
00:06:01,077 --> 00:06:03,419
to talk about in general sort of this idea that

113
00:06:03,599 --> 00:06:06,160
AI is kind of a hot topic today and everybody, you know,

114
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,902
invests money and tries to figure out a way to make it useful and obviously, you know,

115
00:06:09,902 --> 00:06:14,985
every single industry is throwing bajillions of dollars into it, but games are a little different.

116
00:06:14,985 --> 00:06:20,328
There's not as many tangible results as we would like and apparently there was the AI

117
00:06:20,328 --> 00:06:23,450
bootcamp yesterday and there's been a bunch of cool talks so I suggest you check it out,

118
00:06:23,450 --> 00:06:27,292
but there's not a lot of product that shipped with AI. There's tech and people have done

119
00:06:27,292 --> 00:06:30,493
experiments but we still are waiting for that, you know, tentpole moment of like, oh,

120
00:06:30,833 --> 00:06:33,114
this is now part of our everyday life

121
00:06:33,114 --> 00:06:36,175
and everybody uses that, which is both good and bad,

122
00:06:36,175 --> 00:06:38,997
but what that means is there's a lot for us to explore

123
00:06:38,997 --> 00:06:40,397
and so we're gonna try and unpack that

124
00:06:40,397 --> 00:06:43,298
and sort of the core subjects that we're gonna discuss

125
00:06:43,298 --> 00:06:45,779
are gonna be rendering, content creation,

126
00:06:45,779 --> 00:06:48,340
and then actually sort of the, as weird as it is to say,

127
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:50,581
the social aspect of working together

128
00:06:50,581 --> 00:06:51,861
with an intelligent system,

129
00:06:51,861 --> 00:06:54,282
which is gonna be a fascinating conversation.

130
00:06:54,282 --> 00:06:56,343
But first, let's just break it down a little bit.

131
00:06:56,343 --> 00:06:56,723
And I think,

132
00:06:57,103 --> 00:06:59,725
a good definition of what AI can do in general, right,

133
00:06:59,725 --> 00:07:02,166
is one by Andrew Ying, which is basically

134
00:07:02,166 --> 00:07:03,787
whatever your brain can think of in a second,

135
00:07:03,787 --> 00:07:05,968
like a very simple operation that doesn't require

136
00:07:05,968 --> 00:07:06,989
a lot of your attention,

137
00:07:06,989 --> 00:07:09,450
is something you can technically conceivably accomplish.

138
00:07:09,450 --> 00:07:11,511
And the other definition I've heard that I kinda like

139
00:07:11,511 --> 00:07:13,692
is AI is sort of like an army of 10 year olds.

140
00:07:13,692 --> 00:07:15,233
They have the basic skills,

141
00:07:15,233 --> 00:07:18,255
but the attention span is really, really freaking tiny.

142
00:07:18,255 --> 00:07:19,596
So whenever you're trying to solve a problem,

143
00:07:19,596 --> 00:07:20,196
think about that.

144
00:07:20,196 --> 00:07:20,936
Can I apply AI to that?

145
00:07:20,936 --> 00:07:21,997
Can you take an army of 10 year olds

146
00:07:21,997 --> 00:07:23,778
and will they be able to do it?

147
00:07:24,038 --> 00:07:25,759
And it all boils down to patterns, right?

148
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:27,780
It's math, it's structure, we look at things

149
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:30,942
and we predict how these things might end up down the line.

150
00:07:30,942 --> 00:07:33,763
And so this is basically what we're gonna be discussing.

151
00:07:33,763 --> 00:07:35,064
And we're gonna start with rendering,

152
00:07:35,064 --> 00:07:38,025
and I think that's just lends itself very well

153
00:07:38,025 --> 00:07:39,706
to an understanding of how you might perceive

154
00:07:39,706 --> 00:07:42,908
that information if you were an artificial intelligence.

155
00:07:42,908 --> 00:07:45,809
And that is, an image is basically a pattern of pixels.

156
00:07:45,809 --> 00:07:49,291
And if we were to present the simplest problem

157
00:07:49,291 --> 00:07:51,873
of what can an army of 10 year olds do,

158
00:07:53,144 --> 00:07:57,648
It's basically, take a bunch of 10 year olds, give them these little squares of the image,

159
00:07:57,648 --> 00:08:01,992
like tiny chunks of like 10 by 10 pixels, and go, could you fill in the missing black

160
00:08:01,992 --> 00:08:05,815
pixels, like with a reasonable result, even if you don't have an access to the entire

161
00:08:05,815 --> 00:08:06,015
image.

162
00:08:06,015 --> 00:08:10,319
And that is technically a problem that even most of us, you know, without being exposed

163
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:12,381
to the rest of the image could accomplish quite well.

164
00:08:12,761 --> 00:08:16,503
and that would somehow be representative of the final image

165
00:08:16,503 --> 00:08:19,165
and that seems like an entirely asinine problem,

166
00:08:19,165 --> 00:08:21,626
but when you start applying it at a grander scale

167
00:08:21,626 --> 00:08:22,507
to how rendering is done,

168
00:08:22,507 --> 00:08:25,068
this is in many ways revolutionary

169
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:26,729
and this is nothing new,

170
00:08:26,729 --> 00:08:29,311
it's a reasonably oldish NVIDIA research,

171
00:08:29,311 --> 00:08:32,533
but I think what it informs you of is this idea

172
00:08:32,533 --> 00:08:34,834
that we can actually do half the amount of rendering

173
00:08:34,834 --> 00:08:35,895
than we're used to and just.

174
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:39,518
kind of figure out the rest as if we had an army of, you know,

175
00:08:39,518 --> 00:08:42,681
little AIs just sitting there and painting in those pixels for us.

176
00:08:42,681 --> 00:08:47,025
And what that allows you to do is basically dramatically scale down

177
00:08:47,025 --> 00:08:49,187
the amount of computation you need to do, speed up the rendering,

178
00:08:49,187 --> 00:08:52,810
add more stuff on screen, and just that one simple fact.

179
00:08:52,870 --> 00:08:55,311
just that one simple thing is already in itself

180
00:08:55,311 --> 00:08:57,651
revolutionary and of course you've seen a lot

181
00:08:57,651 --> 00:09:00,552
that talks about the NVIDIA RTX and all of that stuff

182
00:09:00,552 --> 00:09:02,553
and not all of these denoisers by the way

183
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:04,453
that NVIDIA is using today are AI based,

184
00:09:04,453 --> 00:09:05,933
but there's more stuff coming.

185
00:09:05,933 --> 00:09:09,654
But just starting with a simple problem and simple solution,

186
00:09:09,654 --> 00:09:11,915
just that one thing can fundamentally change

187
00:09:11,915 --> 00:09:14,295
so many things that we know about rendering

188
00:09:14,295 --> 00:09:16,736
because once again, the Moore's Law given out,

189
00:09:16,736 --> 00:09:18,616
like we're not getting as much hardware gains

190
00:09:18,616 --> 00:09:20,077
as we're used to, which means that in order

191
00:09:20,077 --> 00:09:22,257
to get better graphics, we need to somehow figure out

192
00:09:22,257 --> 00:09:22,797
how to process.

193
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:25,100
And that is an interesting way of doing that.

194
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:27,322
And of course, the question you have is,

195
00:09:27,322 --> 00:09:29,184
well okay, but when will it be fast enough

196
00:09:29,184 --> 00:09:30,866
or ready enough for production?

197
00:09:30,866 --> 00:09:33,489
And the fun answer is like about three years ago.

198
00:09:33,489 --> 00:09:36,171
So this paper came out, SIGGRAPH Asia 2016,

199
00:09:36,171 --> 00:09:37,773
and I've actually talked to people

200
00:09:37,773 --> 00:09:39,875
who have it implemented in their studios

201
00:09:39,875 --> 00:09:40,736
as research projects.

202
00:09:40,897 --> 00:09:44,718
it's working, but nobody's putting it in a game because we are very risk averse

203
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:47,720
and games are very expensive and so there's gonna have to be an interesting

204
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,102
point in my guess it's somewhere around the console generation transition where

205
00:09:51,102 --> 00:09:55,604
we're actually more sort of invested in the idea of trying riskier things and

206
00:09:55,604 --> 00:09:59,746
seeing what what shakes out especially as complexity grows exponentially and we

207
00:09:59,746 --> 00:10:03,008
actually are hard-pressed for you know bigger gains but that is just that

208
00:10:03,008 --> 00:10:04,668
interesting idea that like that technology exists

209
00:10:04,929 --> 00:10:09,391
It runs on GPU in shader, AI-based screen space ambient occlusion that is actually higher quality

210
00:10:09,391 --> 00:10:12,073
than most things you would get with the traditional method.

211
00:10:12,073 --> 00:10:13,334
So there he goes.

212
00:10:13,334 --> 00:10:16,375
But just taking that idea further, and we're just going to go through a bunch of cool videos

213
00:10:16,375 --> 00:10:20,218
because it's fun, and talk about all of the creative freedom that this allows you for.

214
00:10:20,218 --> 00:10:22,799
So when we're talking about rendering, we're also talking about iteration.

215
00:10:22,799 --> 00:10:26,681
Your ability to experiment as an artist is basically handicapped by how

216
00:10:26,681 --> 00:10:28,723
fast the computer can process the things you're working on.

217
00:10:29,123 --> 00:10:33,585
And so this is the research out of Disney, where they can basically borderline real-time,

218
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:36,587
visualize lighting, these very complicated, you know, volumetric systems.

219
00:10:36,587 --> 00:10:38,868
And what that means is, as an artist at some point in a video game,

220
00:10:38,868 --> 00:10:43,691
you'll literally just sort of sculpt your fluffy clouds and see them immediately rendered in front of you.

221
00:10:43,691 --> 00:10:47,273
And that is really cool, because this is something that has not been possible before

222
00:10:47,273 --> 00:10:51,836
and is going to ungate new opportunities for you as artists and allow you to express more cool things.

223
00:10:52,642 --> 00:10:54,244
But something that's very interesting

224
00:10:54,244 --> 00:10:56,747
is that it turns out that if we take that simple idea of,

225
00:10:56,747 --> 00:10:58,429
I have a bunch of points, and then I

226
00:10:58,429 --> 00:11:00,291
remove some of those points, and then I

227
00:11:00,291 --> 00:11:01,713
can fill in some of those points,

228
00:11:01,713 --> 00:11:03,835
that translates to so many more applications

229
00:11:03,835 --> 00:11:06,018
that we have, like particle systems.

230
00:11:06,018 --> 00:11:09,382
Particles, essentially, are just a collection of points.

231
00:11:09,962 --> 00:11:12,883
generate less points and then just use an AI-based system

232
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,904
to figure out what the rest of the points are.

233
00:11:14,904 --> 00:11:16,504
And so what that means is imagine as an artist,

234
00:11:16,504 --> 00:11:18,365
you can actually have real-time flute simulations

235
00:11:18,365 --> 00:11:20,325
in a game that are full 3D

236
00:11:20,325 --> 00:11:21,385
and interacting with your environment.

237
00:11:21,385 --> 00:11:23,586
Like, these are things that were not possible before,

238
00:11:23,586 --> 00:11:25,927
but they're gonna be inevitably,

239
00:11:25,927 --> 00:11:27,467
you know, and hopefully reasonably soon.

240
00:11:27,467 --> 00:11:30,708
And there's some fun research for doing similar things,

241
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:33,049
but this is basically more in 2D,

242
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:36,069
but it's the same idea is that we can sort of take

243
00:11:36,069 --> 00:11:39,170
a lower res, you know, simulation and then just use

244
00:11:39,210 --> 00:11:43,276
AI stuff to basically accelerate and predict the next frames of how the simulation is going

245
00:11:43,276 --> 00:11:44,078
to look.

246
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:49,025
And I think the key phrase here is predict how the next frame is going to look, whatever

247
00:11:49,025 --> 00:11:53,051
this applies to, because there are a lot of mathematical connotations, but there are some

248
00:11:53,051 --> 00:11:54,894
that are artistic, that are incredibly fascinating.

249
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:57,757
And that is basically what happens in this process, right?

250
00:11:57,757 --> 00:12:00,440
We're so used to like, we're doing particle simulation, right?

251
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:05,165
Let's take every particle and calculate how it bounces and bumps against every other particle,

252
00:12:05,165 --> 00:12:09,209
which takes forever, no matter how many transistors you put on a tiny piece of silicone.

253
00:12:09,209 --> 00:12:14,495
And so what these systems provide us with is an actual opportunity to,

254
00:12:14,495 --> 00:12:17,478
instead of calculate it, just sort of figure out how that looks.

255
00:12:18,032 --> 00:12:20,754
and then just sort of spit it out back at you.

256
00:12:20,754 --> 00:12:22,415
So something you don't do as an artist

257
00:12:22,415 --> 00:12:24,236
when you're painting water is you're not sitting there

258
00:12:24,236 --> 00:12:26,317
trying to solve a fluid simulation in your head.

259
00:12:26,317 --> 00:12:29,119
You look at it and you go, okay, I think these are nice shapes

260
00:12:29,119 --> 00:12:31,580
and they're kind of evocative of what I'm trying to tell.

261
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,682
You're not solving light transport equations

262
00:12:33,682 --> 00:12:35,202
when you're trying to just render something

263
00:12:35,202 --> 00:12:38,624
in 2D with watercolors or Photoshop or whatever it is.

264
00:12:38,624 --> 00:12:41,266
And something that fascinates me about this technology

265
00:12:41,266 --> 00:12:44,028
is that it essentially learns how to be more like you.

266
00:12:44,368 --> 00:12:46,308
how to not calculate everything,

267
00:12:46,308 --> 00:12:48,469
but learn and memorize how things look

268
00:12:48,469 --> 00:12:49,529
so that you can express it back to you.

269
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:51,210
And what that also ends up bringing us

270
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,731
is dramatic increases in actual efficiency.

271
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:56,351
So that is very interesting,

272
00:12:56,351 --> 00:13:00,273
but I guess something to take away from this section is

273
00:13:00,273 --> 00:13:02,133
AI is more like you than traditional programming,

274
00:13:02,133 --> 00:13:02,793
which is kind of cool.

275
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:05,761
The next thing is style transfer, which is,

276
00:13:05,761 --> 00:13:06,841
by all intents and purposes,

277
00:13:06,841 --> 00:13:08,261
if you're an artist, kind of useless.

278
00:13:08,261 --> 00:13:10,582
And we've all seen this gimmick videos going around,

279
00:13:10,582 --> 00:13:11,802
and you know, throw in an image,

280
00:13:11,802 --> 00:13:12,842
get another image that looks like

281
00:13:12,842 --> 00:13:14,283
the Starry Night by Van Gogh or something,

282
00:13:14,283 --> 00:13:16,663
and there's literally no good application for an artist.

283
00:13:16,663 --> 00:13:18,804
But I'm gonna go through a bunch of steps

284
00:13:18,804 --> 00:13:21,004
that are actually going to explain to you

285
00:13:21,004 --> 00:13:22,785
why this could be really good for rendering.

286
00:13:22,785 --> 00:13:24,865
And we're gonna start with a simple idea.

287
00:13:24,865 --> 00:13:26,406
You can transfer from a simplified style

288
00:13:26,406 --> 00:13:27,486
to a more complicated style, right?

289
00:13:27,486 --> 00:13:29,426
And we've seen the paint a cat or whatever.

290
00:13:29,426 --> 00:13:31,907
If not, just come by, give me a business card,

291
00:13:31,907 --> 00:13:33,467
I'll send you a link to it, you can paint some cats.

292
00:13:34,148 --> 00:13:37,851
But the cool idea that comes out of this

293
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:40,433
is that you can basically take one type of video

294
00:13:40,433 --> 00:13:42,935
or one type of frame and then transfer it into another one.

295
00:13:42,935 --> 00:13:44,816
Like this is research done at NVIDIA

296
00:13:44,816 --> 00:13:46,578
where they basically take self-driving

297
00:13:46,578 --> 00:13:47,599
or just regular car footage

298
00:13:47,599 --> 00:13:49,380
and then they transfer it from like,

299
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:51,021
here's a spring version and a winter version,

300
00:13:51,021 --> 00:13:52,543
or like here's night and day,

301
00:13:52,543 --> 00:13:55,345
but then what they can also do is they can take a real,

302
00:13:55,345 --> 00:13:58,287
a real video and transfer it into something

303
00:13:58,287 --> 00:13:59,188
that looks like a video game.

304
00:13:59,877 --> 00:14:01,719
which is a fascinating idea,

305
00:14:01,719 --> 00:14:04,421
and it's actually been trained on GTA V,

306
00:14:04,421 --> 00:14:05,562
so good on GTA V,

307
00:14:05,562 --> 00:14:09,005
but what this lends itself to is actually the reversal.

308
00:14:09,005 --> 00:14:11,608
You can basically render a game frame

309
00:14:11,608 --> 00:14:13,109
and then figure out a way to convert it

310
00:14:13,109 --> 00:14:14,791
into something that looks photoreal.

311
00:14:15,217 --> 00:14:17,397
which is, I mean, photo real is a bit of a stretch today,

312
00:14:17,397 --> 00:14:19,959
and I understand that, but something that's very interesting

313
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,059
with all of that is that basically,

314
00:14:22,059 --> 00:14:24,620
potentially, down the line, the rendering process

315
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,001
or how you used to visualize the things

316
00:14:26,001 --> 00:14:29,803
can be not focused on actually calculating, you know,

317
00:14:29,803 --> 00:14:31,363
the light that bounces off a pixel,

318
00:14:31,363 --> 00:14:33,824
but just rendering out the semantic segmentation map

319
00:14:33,824 --> 00:14:36,405
of this is a bicycle, this is a car,

320
00:14:36,405 --> 00:14:38,246
and then you have an AI system

321
00:14:38,246 --> 00:14:40,447
that actually figures out how to render it,

322
00:14:40,447 --> 00:14:42,768
and so this is an actual AI rendered video

323
00:14:42,768 --> 00:14:43,948
that...

324
00:14:44,309 --> 00:14:47,051
takes a similar sort of segmentation map

325
00:14:47,051 --> 00:14:49,132
and renders an entire frame for you

326
00:14:49,132 --> 00:14:50,774
where you don't place the lights,

327
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,654
you don't place the textures,

328
00:14:51,654 --> 00:14:53,456
you just go, this is a street, there are cars here.

329
00:14:53,456 --> 00:14:56,478
Could you please just remember how it's supposed to look

330
00:14:56,478 --> 00:14:58,200
and sort of apply that artistic lens to it?

331
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:01,722
And this is an entirely different sort of paradigm shift

332
00:15:01,722 --> 00:15:05,105
of a concept that can apply to rendering.

333
00:15:05,105 --> 00:15:06,886
And what's fascinating about this,

334
00:15:06,886 --> 00:15:08,548
and I'm sorry this is gonna get a little bit technical,

335
00:15:08,548 --> 00:15:09,168
but it's also kind of cool,

336
00:15:09,168 --> 00:15:10,409
so hopefully you'll appreciate it,

337
00:15:10,409 --> 00:15:13,111
is that conceptually the way...

338
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:21,975
neural networks work is they are stable and predictable as far as how many cycles in memory

339
00:15:21,975 --> 00:15:25,837
they take. They literally take the same amount of memory and cycles every single time. Because

340
00:15:25,837 --> 00:15:30,159
when you run your game and you render your frame, and I optimize many games, so I know that pain

341
00:15:30,159 --> 00:15:33,902
all too well, your game only runs as good as the worst spot you have in your environment.

342
00:15:33,922 --> 00:15:38,565
Meaning, your entire beautiful, beautiful world that you've built is like 60% of how

343
00:15:38,565 --> 00:15:42,588
cool it could look because you can look out the window and through a glass statue that's

344
00:15:42,588 --> 00:15:45,850
going to be reflected and that one thing, and you literally have to account for that

345
00:15:45,850 --> 00:15:49,112
and bring down everything else because that's how the current rendering works.

346
00:15:49,112 --> 00:15:51,134
And that's basically programming for you today.

347
00:15:51,134 --> 00:15:54,396
You write an algorithm and then it might run more things or less things.

348
00:15:54,396 --> 00:15:58,079
But when you literally run the same amount of pixels through a neural network that visualizes

349
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,221
or renders this for you, it's going to be exactly the same every single time, which

350
00:16:01,221 --> 00:16:01,741
means that.

351
00:16:02,382 --> 00:16:05,642
It scales more easily, it actually plays a lot better

352
00:16:05,642 --> 00:16:06,823
with different types of hardware.

353
00:16:06,823 --> 00:16:08,323
And what that technically means is that

354
00:16:08,323 --> 00:16:10,944
it's just better suited for the problem we have at hand,

355
00:16:10,944 --> 00:16:13,204
which is quite fascinating to think about

356
00:16:13,204 --> 00:16:16,645
because it means that on a long enough time frame,

357
00:16:16,645 --> 00:16:18,985
it will inevitably be a better way to do it,

358
00:16:18,985 --> 00:16:20,366
which is quite fascinating.

359
00:16:20,366 --> 00:16:22,266
But yeah, hopefully this is useful.

360
00:16:22,266 --> 00:16:22,926
I know it's quite technical.

361
00:16:22,926 --> 00:16:24,427
It'll lead somewhere, I promise.

362
00:16:25,675 --> 00:16:28,095
The next cool thing is actually,

363
00:16:28,095 --> 00:16:29,756
we're gonna talk about content a little bit,

364
00:16:29,756 --> 00:16:32,056
but the focus is now going to be a lot more

365
00:16:32,056 --> 00:16:34,737
to applying to the things that we can do as artists.

366
00:16:34,737 --> 00:16:37,597
And the one thing for any Blade Runner fan

367
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:39,938
is obviously the iconic scene of just enhance,

368
00:16:39,938 --> 00:16:40,938
enhance everything.

369
00:16:40,938 --> 00:16:42,938
And I remember watching that and thinking,

370
00:16:42,938 --> 00:16:44,559
this is not possible, this is silly,

371
00:16:44,559 --> 00:16:45,959
there's no information there.

372
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,239
And well, the fun thing is,

373
00:16:47,239 --> 00:16:48,760
even if there's no information there,

374
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:50,420
it doesn't mean that we can just come up

375
00:16:50,420 --> 00:16:51,300
with that information.

376
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,801
And so super resolution is an idea of like,

377
00:16:53,801 --> 00:16:55,783
oh, I can draw a low-res piece of concept art

378
00:16:55,783 --> 00:16:57,163
and then just have something up-res it

379
00:16:57,163 --> 00:16:59,144
and fill in the missing detail,

380
00:16:59,144 --> 00:17:01,285
is pretty much a reality today.

381
00:17:01,285 --> 00:17:03,006
There are all these fascinating projects of like,

382
00:17:03,006 --> 00:17:04,787
hey, let's take Final Fantasy VIII or something

383
00:17:04,787 --> 00:17:06,688
and just auto-up-res all of the backgrounds

384
00:17:06,688 --> 00:17:09,110
and then just re-release an HD version

385
00:17:09,110 --> 00:17:11,251
that is better than any source material has ever looked.

386
00:17:11,831 --> 00:17:15,393
and that is very interesting, but that also just allows us

387
00:17:15,393 --> 00:17:17,874
to abstract the type of art that we produce.

388
00:17:17,874 --> 00:17:20,035
We're like, oh, maybe I don't have to fill in all the details.

389
00:17:20,035 --> 00:17:22,076
Maybe I can just, you know, have a baseline

390
00:17:22,076 --> 00:17:25,198
and then stuff can sort of work with me to accelerate it.

391
00:17:25,198 --> 00:17:27,780
And it, you know, it works impressively well

392
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,080
in a lot of different situations,

393
00:17:29,080 --> 00:17:30,761
but also it just helps with quality.

394
00:17:30,761 --> 00:17:32,142
How many times have you looked at a texture

395
00:17:32,142 --> 00:17:34,083
and were like, geez, I have to redo it now

396
00:17:34,083 --> 00:17:35,884
because it's like a 512 and I need just a 1024 here.

397
00:17:35,884 --> 00:17:37,225
And then you literally redo it.

398
00:17:37,685 --> 00:17:39,607
repainting it or scaling it up, or like,

399
00:17:39,607 --> 00:17:41,509
oh no, actually I don't have the sculpt anymore for this,

400
00:17:41,509 --> 00:17:42,510
so I can use my normal maps,

401
00:17:42,510 --> 00:17:43,952
I'm just gonna redo everything.

402
00:17:43,952 --> 00:17:46,755
And so like, all of this will technically not be necessary,

403
00:17:46,755 --> 00:17:48,797
which is fascinating because what that does,

404
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:50,098
and I think what's really important about this,

405
00:17:50,098 --> 00:17:52,001
is it frees you from having to think

406
00:17:52,001 --> 00:17:53,442
about the technical limitations.

407
00:17:53,442 --> 00:17:55,424
Your job as an artist is to be creative,

408
00:17:55,424 --> 00:17:57,246
to say, does this shape language work for me?

409
00:17:57,567 --> 00:17:58,728
Do these colors work for me?

410
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:01,450
The fidelity, the amount of pixels, all of that

411
00:18:01,450 --> 00:18:03,931
technically should absolutely not worry you at all.

412
00:18:03,931 --> 00:18:05,513
And some piece of technology should just

413
00:18:05,513 --> 00:18:06,734
automatically take care of that.

414
00:18:06,734 --> 00:18:09,676
And so that is around the corner, which is interesting.

415
00:18:10,538 --> 00:18:11,959
The next thing, however, that is interesting

416
00:18:11,959 --> 00:18:14,521
is that we can literally commoditize

417
00:18:14,521 --> 00:18:16,982
all kinds of sort of content creation.

418
00:18:16,982 --> 00:18:20,904
So we, you know, a great example of one being animation.

419
00:18:20,904 --> 00:18:23,745
So this facial capture on that dude over there

420
00:18:23,745 --> 00:18:26,747
is literally done with a just off-the-shelf iPhone

421
00:18:26,747 --> 00:18:30,589
that anyone can get and then stream it directly into Unreal

422
00:18:30,589 --> 00:18:32,810
and pair it up with a cheap $1,500 motion capture suit

423
00:18:32,810 --> 00:18:35,932
and get a full performance capture that you can do live.

424
00:18:35,932 --> 00:18:36,292
Currently.

425
00:18:37,032 --> 00:18:38,473
you know, at your apartment.

426
00:18:38,473 --> 00:18:40,833
And so the idea that we can democratize

427
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:42,774
the creative process to a point

428
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:45,035
where you as an individual creator can just be like,

429
00:18:45,035 --> 00:18:46,135
oh, you know what, I wanna make

430
00:18:46,135 --> 00:18:48,156
a bunch of cool cinematics for my game, let me do that.

431
00:18:48,156 --> 00:18:49,876
That is pretty mind-blowing,

432
00:18:49,876 --> 00:18:51,337
and it's only gonna keep going.

433
00:18:51,337 --> 00:18:53,497
And I think something that's really exciting

434
00:18:53,497 --> 00:18:55,538
about all of this is that...

435
00:18:55,718 --> 00:19:00,702
we kind of don't have to pull all the weight on our own anymore as just game developers because

436
00:19:00,702 --> 00:19:04,965
we're so used to being responsible for all of the advances in computer graphics and technology

437
00:19:04,965 --> 00:19:11,350
related to that but now all of these you know social companies and you know just general tech

438
00:19:11,350 --> 00:19:15,814
giants have figured out that they can make money off of you by buying poop face emojis so they're

439
00:19:15,814 --> 00:19:19,977
pouring crazy amounts of money into it and we as game developers can actually benefit from that

440
00:19:19,977 --> 00:19:24,140
because now they're doing all of the R&D that we can shamelessly use and so that is good.

441
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,142
And you can expect to take more and more advantages of that.

442
00:19:29,142 --> 00:19:30,843
The other thing that is interesting

443
00:19:30,843 --> 00:19:32,623
is the actual content creation of 3D meshes.

444
00:19:32,623 --> 00:19:33,904
And there is a whole bunch of research into like,

445
00:19:33,904 --> 00:19:35,184
oh, can we turn a picture into a 3D model?

446
00:19:35,184 --> 00:19:39,026
And honestly, the quality is not that great.

447
00:19:39,026 --> 00:19:40,726
Like, I'm not holding my breath for this one.

448
00:19:40,726 --> 00:19:43,307
And I think something that is much more likely to happen

449
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:45,328
is we're gonna take a process that has proven

450
00:19:45,328 --> 00:19:48,149
to have the fidelity first that we need,

451
00:19:48,149 --> 00:19:50,430
and then we're gonna look at it as a whole bunch of points,

452
00:19:50,430 --> 00:19:51,310
and then we'll be like, hey,

453
00:19:51,310 --> 00:19:52,511
where have we seen this before?

454
00:19:53,191 --> 00:19:55,092
And it's basically the same problem.

455
00:19:55,092 --> 00:19:57,813
Can we speed up photogrammetry 20 times more

456
00:19:57,813 --> 00:19:58,673
and use less images?

457
00:19:58,673 --> 00:20:00,914
Because take a bunch of pictures with your iPhone,

458
00:20:00,914 --> 00:20:02,655
we super resolution them to double the size,

459
00:20:02,655 --> 00:20:05,356
then we speed up the process of turning it into a 3D model

460
00:20:05,356 --> 00:20:08,798
by filling in more of these missing points with AI,

461
00:20:08,798 --> 00:20:10,919
and then at some point you can literally generate

462
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,880
high quality 3D assets with your phone.

463
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,981
And that would be really cool, because that

464
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:17,423
means that now you can actually focus on composing your worlds

465
00:20:17,423 --> 00:20:19,926
and communicating vision and sort of telling stories

466
00:20:19,926 --> 00:20:20,987
and all of that.

467
00:20:20,987 --> 00:20:23,669
And the technology will allow you to do that.

468
00:20:23,669 --> 00:20:24,650
But now, of course, you're wondering,

469
00:20:24,650 --> 00:20:25,951
well, what about materials?

470
00:20:27,431 --> 00:20:30,653
Well, I'm sorry to say that is also happening and

471
00:20:30,653 --> 00:20:32,793
the the cool thing is and I

472
00:20:32,793 --> 00:20:38,556
Like sort of that way of thinking if you can look at a flat image and figure out what is a highlight

473
00:20:38,556 --> 00:20:41,337
What is a shadow coming from the surface?

474
00:20:41,337 --> 00:20:46,440
Sort of bump and what is just the base color and there's no reason we can't train a neural network to do that

475
00:20:46,920 --> 00:20:49,682
And so the ability to decompose a single image

476
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:52,925
into like a BRDF is something that's been prototyped.

477
00:20:52,925 --> 00:20:53,425
It's there.

478
00:20:53,425 --> 00:20:54,907
You can probably find the source code online

479
00:20:54,907 --> 00:20:56,548
if you want to to mess around with it.

480
00:20:56,548 --> 00:20:59,490
But the idea is that all of these technical steps

481
00:20:59,490 --> 00:21:01,292
that we're so used to taking

482
00:21:01,292 --> 00:21:03,754
are kind of slowly getting picked off one by one,

483
00:21:03,754 --> 00:21:06,837
which can be both scary and interesting.

484
00:21:06,837 --> 00:21:07,998
We're gonna talk about the scary part,

485
00:21:07,998 --> 00:21:09,379
but for now the main thing that I'm trying

486
00:21:09,379 --> 00:21:11,220
to sort of get across here is just to make sure

487
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:13,622
you are informed about what's happening.

488
00:21:14,611 --> 00:21:18,993
The interesting thing that happens with a lot of AI training is that the whole point

489
00:21:18,993 --> 00:21:23,055
of it is to figure out the underlying features of whatever you're trying to teach it.

490
00:21:23,055 --> 00:21:27,677
So if you show it a bunch of images, either they're labeled, or in this case they're just

491
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,978
somehow grouped based on whatever properties they have.

492
00:21:30,938 --> 00:21:32,760
You can have a system that figures out that,

493
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,422
oh, there are all of these properties

494
00:21:34,422 --> 00:21:37,324
that correspond with something being old versus new,

495
00:21:37,324 --> 00:21:39,787
and then you can literally have a neural network,

496
00:21:39,787 --> 00:21:40,668
like in this example,

497
00:21:40,668 --> 00:21:42,650
that can actually just age your surfaces for you.

498
00:21:42,650 --> 00:21:44,191
So you just drop in a texture and go,

499
00:21:44,191 --> 00:21:45,252
I want this to be old now.

500
00:21:45,953 --> 00:21:56,622
And something that is fascinating about this is that the creative intent, the creative problem solving stopped with you saying this needs to be all down because the rest of it is like, oh, which pixel do I put where?

501
00:21:56,622 --> 00:22:00,184
And and you still have the freedom to go in and retouch afterwards.

502
00:22:00,184 --> 00:22:03,567
But a lot of the time in a production, when you have a lot of worlds to build.

503
00:22:04,308 --> 00:22:08,889
all of this is a lot less relevant to you. There are only so many things you care about and what

504
00:22:08,889 --> 00:22:13,130
this technology would actually allow you to do is have the freedom to choose what you want to spend

505
00:22:13,130 --> 00:22:18,312
your time on manually finessing and adjusting instead of having to constantly be bogged down

506
00:22:18,312 --> 00:22:21,773
with trying to finesse or not even finesse just scramble to get everything in and that honestly

507
00:22:21,773 --> 00:22:27,875
one of the things that broke my heart a lot you know working with artists at a game studio that

508
00:22:27,875 --> 00:22:30,195
had deadlines that had to ship products was

509
00:22:30,575 --> 00:22:33,237
An artist once told me that he never gets to do his 100%

510
00:22:33,237 --> 00:22:36,178
because everything always gets to like 80%

511
00:22:36,178 --> 00:22:37,738
and then it's always taken away

512
00:22:37,738 --> 00:22:40,720
because there's so much game to make and you need to rush

513
00:22:40,720 --> 00:22:43,901
and just the sheer volume does not allow the freedom

514
00:22:43,901 --> 00:22:45,101
for an individual artist to say,

515
00:22:45,101 --> 00:22:46,882
this is really important, I wanna polish it.

516
00:22:47,422 --> 00:22:49,783
spend three days on this and make it the most freaking

517
00:22:49,783 --> 00:22:52,023
amazing statue or crate or whatever else it is,

518
00:22:52,023 --> 00:22:54,484
but we kind of lost that freedom through the fact that

519
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:57,565
the amount of content that we have to produce

520
00:22:57,565 --> 00:23:00,326
is just mind-boggling, and we're just scrambling

521
00:23:00,326 --> 00:23:01,706
all the time to cover our bases,

522
00:23:01,706 --> 00:23:04,027
and I think that this is going to be a very helpful

523
00:23:04,027 --> 00:23:05,367
sort of aid in that problem.

524
00:23:05,367 --> 00:23:07,308
We're back to style transfer, which is still useless,

525
00:23:07,308 --> 00:23:09,788
but there's interesting applications to it

526
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:12,249
which might actually make it a little more useful,

527
00:23:12,249 --> 00:23:15,830
and it, of all places, is going to be about stylization.

528
00:23:15,830 --> 00:23:15,930
So.

529
00:23:16,970 --> 00:23:20,293
Okay, we know that like I don't want to just build a final image and then go,

530
00:23:20,293 --> 00:23:22,075
oh, could you now stylize this for me?

531
00:23:22,075 --> 00:23:24,717
Because artistically that I can't control the process.

532
00:23:24,717 --> 00:23:26,018
It's of no interest.

533
00:23:26,018 --> 00:23:27,619
But what if I already have a style?

534
00:23:27,619 --> 00:23:28,940
I'm halfway through a painting,

535
00:23:28,940 --> 00:23:32,563
and then I have this piece of reference that now I just have to like repaint.

536
00:23:32,904 --> 00:23:35,506
because it doesn't fit with the rendering style that I have,

537
00:23:35,506 --> 00:23:37,327
well, that is a lot different of a problem.

538
00:23:37,327 --> 00:23:39,789
And then if you can have a system that will just sort of

539
00:23:39,789 --> 00:23:42,612
pick up on the artistic cues that you've set forth

540
00:23:42,612 --> 00:23:45,234
and automatically fill it in for you, now you're saving time.

541
00:23:45,234 --> 00:23:47,456
Now you can still paint on top of it, do whatever you want,

542
00:23:47,456 --> 00:23:48,556
make it yours.

543
00:23:48,857 --> 00:23:53,698
but the fact that you don't have to do the work that you don't care about is going to be extremely

544
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:57,360
valuable. And there's just another example of that. And that I think is very interesting,

545
00:23:57,360 --> 00:24:01,541
because we care about preserving our creative intent. We care about preserving our artistic

546
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,643
style. And this is actually an example of technology that is quite literally focused

547
00:24:05,643 --> 00:24:09,824
around that. It's not there to tell you how your style is supposed to look. It's there to learn

548
00:24:09,824 --> 00:24:14,126
from you, pick up on your cues, and then apply them to whatever you're doing, which I think is

549
00:24:14,126 --> 00:24:16,947
a lot more of a healthy approach to look at that.

550
00:24:18,903 --> 00:24:24,267
Okay, the next is generation. And I'm sure you've seen a bunch of these videos going around.

551
00:24:24,267 --> 00:24:26,529
Generative adversarial networks, generating fake faces.

552
00:24:26,529 --> 00:24:29,271
If you go online, I think there's a website called These People Don't Exist,

553
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,473
and it's basically just generating a new face for you every time.

554
00:24:31,473 --> 00:24:34,676
And then someone really smart made a website called These Cats Don't Exist,

555
00:24:34,676 --> 00:24:36,477
where they generate you a fake cat every time.

556
00:24:36,477 --> 00:24:38,379
So I highly suggest you check it out.

557
00:24:38,899 --> 00:24:40,821
But the cool thing is we can generate things.

558
00:24:40,821 --> 00:24:43,644
The big problem is we kind of can't control them at all,

559
00:24:43,644 --> 00:24:45,385
which also kind of makes them useless for us.

560
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:47,848
Because what we want is we want directability.

561
00:24:47,848 --> 00:24:50,110
We want to actually articulate the features we care about.

562
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,652
We want to tell the AI how we want this to look,

563
00:24:52,652 --> 00:24:54,313
and then it should kind of do the job.

564
00:24:54,313 --> 00:24:56,515
And so the best we have right now is basically

565
00:24:56,515 --> 00:24:58,978
navigating this weird feature space of like,

566
00:24:58,978 --> 00:25:00,539
oh, all of these images are kind of similar

567
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:01,680
and I can blend between them.

568
00:25:02,020 --> 00:25:03,801
And so that is sort of a step, right?

569
00:25:03,801 --> 00:25:06,763
Because what's interesting is in all of this similarity space,

570
00:25:06,763 --> 00:25:08,564
there's possibility for discerning

571
00:25:08,564 --> 00:25:09,665
some actual parameters.

572
00:25:09,665 --> 00:25:10,225
Like, oh, you know what?

573
00:25:10,225 --> 00:25:11,306
I just want a bigger nose.

574
00:25:11,306 --> 00:25:15,508
Or I want a different eyebrow shape or something like that.

575
00:25:15,508 --> 00:25:18,150
And once we figure that out and we can actually

576
00:25:18,150 --> 00:25:19,931
expose that as controls to artists.

577
00:25:20,491 --> 00:25:24,452
it's gonna save you time. Now creating characters is less about applying every single brushstroke

578
00:25:24,452 --> 00:25:29,633
and more about what is about this person that makes them who they are. What are their facial

579
00:25:29,633 --> 00:25:33,814
features? What is, you know, the particular, whatever, is there a scar that tells a story?

580
00:25:33,814 --> 00:25:40,575
Is there whatever color of their hair or eyes or whatever else? And so that part is interesting.

581
00:25:40,575 --> 00:25:43,516
And the interesting part is it also applies to other things.

582
00:25:44,096 --> 00:25:49,360
most things and it's all being done in 2D. I think we're reasonably far from doing it in 3D yet but just I think

583
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,565
something once again that's extremely important to take away from this is not the technology itself. It's that idea

584
00:25:55,565 --> 00:26:00,549
that your creative process becomes closer to art direction that as you work.

585
00:26:01,069 --> 00:26:03,350
you don't have to apply every single brushstroke yourself,

586
00:26:03,350 --> 00:26:05,831
but you're actually directing a certain system to say,

587
00:26:05,831 --> 00:26:07,792
oh, I wish these cars were more like this,

588
00:26:07,792 --> 00:26:10,293
or I wish this interior space was more like this.

589
00:26:10,293 --> 00:26:13,154
And then what that fundamentally allows you to do

590
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,295
is it empowers you to do cool stuff.

591
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,676
And talking about this creative problem solving, right,

592
00:26:17,676 --> 00:26:19,437
where AI is sort of your junior artist

593
00:26:19,437 --> 00:26:20,877
just constantly pitching you ideas,

594
00:26:20,877 --> 00:26:22,698
and you're going, yes, I like this, I don't like that,

595
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:25,339
let's go more with this direction, no, in this direction.

596
00:26:25,339 --> 00:26:26,880
I don't think we should underestimate

597
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:28,661
the amount of creativity that we can get out of this,

598
00:26:28,661 --> 00:26:30,341
and I think this video is going to be a.

599
00:26:30,562 --> 00:26:36,986
In the first experiment, robots were asked to walk around while minimizing the amount of foot contact with the ground.

600
00:26:36,986 --> 00:26:42,611
Much to the scientists' surprise, the robots answered that this can be done with 0% contact,

601
00:26:42,611 --> 00:26:46,434
meaning that they never ever touch the ground with the feet.

602
00:26:46,434 --> 00:26:51,678
The scientists wondered how that is even possible and pulled up the video of the proof.

603
00:26:51,678 --> 00:26:56,481
This proof showed a robot flipping over and walking using its elbows.

604
00:26:56,481 --> 00:26:59,824
Talk about thinking outside the box!

605
00:26:59,824 --> 00:26:59,884
Wow!

606
00:27:02,050 --> 00:27:04,011
I think something that's really cool about that,

607
00:27:04,011 --> 00:27:05,992
and I think something that resonates

608
00:27:05,992 --> 00:27:07,093
with the art direction part of me, right,

609
00:27:07,093 --> 00:27:08,253
is whenever I bring a problem to an artist,

610
00:27:08,253 --> 00:27:10,374
I don't wanna tell them what the solution is.

611
00:27:10,374 --> 00:27:11,615
I wanna present them with a problem

612
00:27:11,615 --> 00:27:12,956
because I know that they're gonna come up

613
00:27:12,956 --> 00:27:15,717
with way more creative things than I would ever have.

614
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:17,778
And I think that applying the same approach

615
00:27:17,778 --> 00:27:19,839
of being the person who asks the right questions,

616
00:27:19,839 --> 00:27:21,680
of actually presenting a system

617
00:27:21,680 --> 00:27:23,481
with the correct problems to solve,

618
00:27:23,481 --> 00:27:26,442
is in a lot of ways going to be the root

619
00:27:26,442 --> 00:27:28,243
of the creativity that we get to exercise,

620
00:27:28,243 --> 00:27:30,024
but also going to be the power amplifier

621
00:27:30,024 --> 00:27:30,745
for the work you do.

622
00:27:31,165 --> 00:27:33,406
and also just going to expose you to a lot more ideas, right?

623
00:27:33,406 --> 00:27:35,348
Because that's what we do with concept art all day.

624
00:27:35,348 --> 00:27:36,749
I need 20 variations of this.

625
00:27:36,749 --> 00:27:38,870
Or here's the problem we're trying to solve with game design.

626
00:27:38,870 --> 00:27:40,111
How's that going to look?

627
00:27:40,111 --> 00:27:42,853
And if you can just get options fed to you at all times,

628
00:27:42,853 --> 00:27:45,335
that is just going to make you that much faster.

629
00:27:45,335 --> 00:27:47,556
Okay, there's another video just because it's fun.

630
00:27:47,556 --> 00:27:50,298
These robots figured out how to use their limbs

631
00:27:50,298 --> 00:27:52,720
and now they're fighting for a piece of food, basically.

632
00:27:52,720 --> 00:27:58,024
And now, and iteratively figuring out how to like push the other robot away.

633
00:27:58,024 --> 00:27:59,125
All right, let's see.

634
00:27:59,125 --> 00:27:59,845
Like, no, it's mine.

635
00:28:02,526 --> 00:28:06,432
or one of them I think just figures out how to jump in.

636
00:28:06,432 --> 00:28:07,353
Just knock it out, boom.

637
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:12,440
This one's cool.

638
00:28:21,987 --> 00:28:24,008
But I think something that's really fun about that, right,

639
00:28:24,008 --> 00:28:27,850
is once again, it asks us and forces upon us

640
00:28:27,850 --> 00:28:30,872
this sort of very introspective line of questioning of,

641
00:28:30,872 --> 00:28:33,013
where's the value that I provide, right?

642
00:28:33,013 --> 00:28:35,915
Is it in actually in setting up these goals right?

643
00:28:35,915 --> 00:28:38,196
And we're gonna talk about that in just a little bit

644
00:28:38,196 --> 00:28:40,378
because we're sort of zeroing in on the next part,

645
00:28:40,378 --> 00:28:43,419
which is like, okay, what is an AI as a creative partner?

646
00:28:43,419 --> 00:28:46,141
But first, we're actually gonna do a really boring bit

647
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:47,882
that I strongly feel that not enough

648
00:28:47,882 --> 00:28:49,543
of the art community is informed about

649
00:28:49,543 --> 00:28:50,063
because I...

650
00:28:50,904 --> 00:28:55,168
I can't stress how much this impacts our ability to be creative and we never talk about it,

651
00:28:55,168 --> 00:28:56,570
which is monies.

652
00:28:56,570 --> 00:29:00,514
And the fact that teams are gigantic, the fact that people crunch, the fact that we

653
00:29:00,514 --> 00:29:04,338
have to stuff every game choke full of loot boxes and other freaking nonsense that we

654
00:29:04,338 --> 00:29:08,102
don't want to do in the first place, is the fact that we can't financially justify making

655
00:29:08,102 --> 00:29:09,824
a game because it's so freaking expensive.

656
00:29:10,284 --> 00:29:14,491
And if you just look at how this breaks down, it's pretty ridiculous already.

657
00:29:14,491 --> 00:29:18,997
Like, the cost of an average game from like a PS1 to a PS4 has grown almost a hundredfold.

658
00:29:18,997 --> 00:29:22,602
We went from like a million dollars to like a hundred million dollars.

659
00:29:23,125 --> 00:29:26,508
Which is crazy because our audiences have not grown a hundredfold.

660
00:29:26,508 --> 00:29:30,752
The cost of a single game to the end user have not grown a hundredfold.

661
00:29:30,752 --> 00:29:35,396
Yet somehow we are expected to build bigger worlds with better teams

662
00:29:35,396 --> 00:29:38,719
and somehow make money. And so I think that is the interesting problem because

663
00:29:38,719 --> 00:29:41,662
we always tend to assume that you know the evil money bag somewhere just going

664
00:29:41,662 --> 00:29:44,124
no you can't make fun creative things I need more loot boxes.

665
00:29:44,124 --> 00:29:45,605
But the problem is that...

666
00:29:46,426 --> 00:29:52,115
Just in order to break even like just for us to be sustainable as a business and have some creative freedom

667
00:29:52,115 --> 00:29:59,486
Like if we project it to like the next console generation, you basically kind of need eight million copies to sell just to break even

668
00:30:00,115 --> 00:30:03,238
Which is stupid, because breaking even is a horrible business strategy.

669
00:30:03,238 --> 00:30:06,120
You can literally take $250 million, put them in a bank,

670
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:08,883
take them out five years later, and you will have made more money

671
00:30:08,883 --> 00:30:10,924
than if you would have made a video game.

672
00:30:10,924 --> 00:30:12,586
Like, how crazy is that?

673
00:30:12,586 --> 00:30:16,909
And so I think that is basically something that is important to realize

674
00:30:16,909 --> 00:30:18,531
because it impacts creativity a lot.

675
00:30:18,531 --> 00:30:21,193
When we're having these discussions on, like,

676
00:30:21,193 --> 00:30:23,155
why isn't there more risk taken?

677
00:30:23,155 --> 00:30:24,636
It is because we cannot afford it.

678
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:29,337
It is because we as individual contributors to the process of making the virtual world

679
00:30:29,337 --> 00:30:34,439
are actually not productive enough and like that the productivity has not caught up with

680
00:30:34,439 --> 00:30:38,400
the exponential growth and complexity because all of us are expected to do 20 times more

681
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:42,162
things than we were expected to do 10 years ago yet somehow we're nowhere near 20 times

682
00:30:42,162 --> 00:30:42,702
more productive.

683
00:30:42,702 --> 00:30:44,102
And so that's the sad part.

684
00:30:44,202 --> 00:30:45,304
And it affects people.

685
00:30:45,304 --> 00:30:47,987
And I'm not going to rant about this again, just because I had

686
00:30:47,987 --> 00:30:48,928
to at the beginning.

687
00:30:48,928 --> 00:30:52,513
But you all know about this all too well.

688
00:30:52,513 --> 00:30:55,437
And yeah, I think we can solve this by literally making

689
00:30:55,437 --> 00:30:57,319
everyone a lot more effective than they are today.

690
00:30:57,319 --> 00:30:59,001
At least, I don't know of a better solution.

691
00:30:59,001 --> 00:31:01,244
But the other thing that is quite fascinating to me is

692
00:31:01,725 --> 00:31:06,788
If we were a movie industry, I think right now we literally only have figured out how to make superhero movies.

693
00:31:06,788 --> 00:31:08,629
Because nothing else economically makes sense.

694
00:31:08,629 --> 00:31:11,551
When you're making a video game, it has to be for everyone.

695
00:31:11,551 --> 00:31:13,832
Because if it's not, you're just not going to make any money back.

696
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,714
And like, there's some sad examples, like I absolutely love vampire games.

697
00:31:16,714 --> 00:31:21,316
There's been like two in the last 15 years that were of any reasonable quality.

698
00:31:21,316 --> 00:31:22,097
Is that not crazy?

699
00:31:22,717 --> 00:31:24,039
You know, there's like cyberpunk games.

700
00:31:24,039 --> 00:31:27,042
There's like Deus Ex and the new cyberpunk that's not out.

701
00:31:27,042 --> 00:31:28,583
And that's literally all you get.

702
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:31,386
I'm sure there's a lot more people that have very peculiar tastes

703
00:31:31,386 --> 00:31:35,310
that they would love to have, you know, an offer for on the market.

704
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,032
We can't do that. We can't take the creative risk.

705
00:31:37,032 --> 00:31:40,095
We can't experiment because it's too damn expensive.

706
00:31:40,095 --> 00:31:43,158
And now that I've ranted through the money part,

707
00:31:43,158 --> 00:31:45,380
I'm going to make it up to you by having a damn break.

708
00:31:56,488 --> 00:31:57,609
This is AI-based dancing.

709
00:31:57,609 --> 00:32:10,540
So next time you want to look cool on Facebook, five years from now, you don't even have to

710
00:32:10,540 --> 00:32:11,180
do anything.

711
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:13,182
Just put a picture of yourself and done.

712
00:32:15,158 --> 00:32:17,580
Okay, but now we're actually gonna talk

713
00:32:17,580 --> 00:32:18,861
about more conceptual things, right?

714
00:32:18,861 --> 00:32:20,582
We know that we want bigger, better,

715
00:32:20,582 --> 00:32:22,484
beautifuller virtual worlds,

716
00:32:22,484 --> 00:32:23,384
and in order to do that,

717
00:32:23,384 --> 00:32:24,866
we need more effective ways of doing that.

718
00:32:24,866 --> 00:32:27,708
But I think the way this whole dialogue

719
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:31,110
has been structured has not been great.

720
00:32:31,110 --> 00:32:32,511
And I've been to tons of video game studios,

721
00:32:32,511 --> 00:32:33,992
from tiny indie ones to gigantic,

722
00:32:33,992 --> 00:32:35,033
you know, AAA production houses,

723
00:32:35,033 --> 00:32:36,454
and literally everyone looks at me

724
00:32:36,454 --> 00:32:37,295
as I walk through the doors,

725
00:32:37,295 --> 00:32:38,656
like either in an indie studio,

726
00:32:38,656 --> 00:32:40,297
it's like, oh, that guy's gonna take our jobs.

727
00:32:40,297 --> 00:32:41,197
And I just go, okay.

728
00:32:41,858 --> 00:32:42,838
fine, let's get through that.

729
00:32:42,838 --> 00:32:43,678
Or the other part is like,

730
00:32:43,678 --> 00:32:44,838
there's no way this works

731
00:32:44,838 --> 00:32:45,959
because it's too complex to work

732
00:32:45,959 --> 00:32:47,519
because AI is very complicated.

733
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,379
And I get both parts of the argument,

734
00:32:49,379 --> 00:32:52,300
but the problem is I think is in the implications

735
00:32:52,300 --> 00:32:53,520
sort of that we put in the name

736
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:55,661
because the word artificial is kind of silly,

737
00:32:55,661 --> 00:32:56,721
doesn't mean anything anymore,

738
00:32:56,721 --> 00:32:58,161
but also intelligence is very debatable

739
00:32:58,161 --> 00:33:00,682
because we not even very discerning

740
00:33:00,682 --> 00:33:03,122
when applying it or not applying it to humans.

741
00:33:03,122 --> 00:33:03,863
So I think the...

742
00:33:04,863 --> 00:33:07,904
The better way to put it and the way we've been focusing on that is actually calling

743
00:33:07,904 --> 00:33:12,406
the assistive intelligence because the whole point is how do we assist you because artificial

744
00:33:12,406 --> 00:33:17,688
kind of implies replacement of something natural and this is not in any way what this technology

745
00:33:17,688 --> 00:33:19,968
can accomplish or should aim to accomplish furthermore.

746
00:33:20,389 --> 00:33:23,590
And something we've been using internally at Promethean is like,

747
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:25,771
we're trying to build the mech suit for your brain,

748
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:27,911
which is the entire idea that you are in the driving seat.

749
00:33:27,911 --> 00:33:32,693
We're power amplifying every single user by allowing them to build more fun things.

750
00:33:32,693 --> 00:33:35,414
And I think a more generic metaphor that I'm going to

751
00:33:35,414 --> 00:33:37,955
shamelessly steal from Steve Jobs is basically the bicycle for the mind.

752
00:33:37,955 --> 00:33:38,836
And I think it...

753
00:33:39,917 --> 00:33:43,259
is such a beautiful metaphor that lends itself very well to this situation.

754
00:33:43,259 --> 00:33:44,480
So if you don't know the story,

755
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,064
there is a study in the 70s of the most effective animals based on transportation.

756
00:33:49,064 --> 00:33:51,866
So at the amount of calories spent per mile traveled,

757
00:33:51,866 --> 00:33:55,189
and the most effective animal in the world was the condor, the bird, which is cool.

758
00:33:55,189 --> 00:33:57,691
But then one of the researchers had that idea of what if we take

759
00:33:57,691 --> 00:34:01,554
a human and put them on a bicycle and then also enter them into that competition?

760
00:34:01,554 --> 00:34:03,716
It turned out that a human on the bicycle is

761
00:34:03,716 --> 00:34:06,659
the most effective animal in the world when it comes to transportation.

762
00:34:07,299 --> 00:34:08,400
with the amount of calories spent.

763
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:11,141
And so basically the technology that we have created

764
00:34:11,141 --> 00:34:14,562
has empowered us to sort of beat our natural limitations

765
00:34:14,562 --> 00:34:16,783
and power amplify us to do things

766
00:34:16,783 --> 00:34:19,804
that we might not have evolved to do in the first place

767
00:34:19,804 --> 00:34:21,685
on a more sort of a natural level.

768
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,646
And I think that that is very interesting,

769
00:34:23,646 --> 00:34:24,546
but also that is something

770
00:34:24,546 --> 00:34:26,067
that's very conceptually important.

771
00:34:26,367 --> 00:34:31,934
why I think it's very important that you are informed about this because whenever you're going to have conversations about AI

772
00:34:31,934 --> 00:34:37,661
technologies coming to you know potentially be used in our workflow. This is the question you're going to have to ask is this

773
00:34:37,661 --> 00:34:44,790
technology trying to replace me or enhance my workflow. Is it trying to amplify what I do. And the truth is that.

774
00:34:45,291 --> 00:34:49,874
whenever somebody tells you that your workflow cannot be amplified, you don't have to take

775
00:34:49,874 --> 00:34:55,017
them at face value. You deserve the technology that will actually serve your creativity, right?

776
00:34:55,017 --> 00:34:59,460
And once again, that is why I think you need to be informed of this. And so the entire concept

777
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:03,503
of building good technology around this is that we can actually celebrate human input,

778
00:35:03,503 --> 00:35:09,167
just like you've seen with the style transfer for the little things that actually picks up

779
00:35:09,167 --> 00:35:10,988
on your creative style and reinforces that.

780
00:35:11,088 --> 00:35:12,948
That's a big part of what we do at Promethean

781
00:35:12,948 --> 00:35:14,849
is figure out a way, how can we learn

782
00:35:14,849 --> 00:35:16,849
the style of every single person who's using it

783
00:35:16,849 --> 00:35:18,770
and try to reflect it back at you,

784
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:20,830
which I think is paramount and critical

785
00:35:20,830 --> 00:35:24,211
and should be part of any AI-based technology

786
00:35:24,211 --> 00:35:25,331
that is going to assist you,

787
00:35:25,331 --> 00:35:27,652
because if we are to be creative,

788
00:35:27,652 --> 00:35:29,352
if we are to make sure that this technology

789
00:35:29,352 --> 00:35:31,412
empowers more things to be done,

790
00:35:31,412 --> 00:35:33,913
it by definition has to be built to celebrate

791
00:35:33,913 --> 00:35:35,954
and sort of amplify our differences

792
00:35:35,954 --> 00:35:37,874
rather than trying to homogenize everyone

793
00:35:37,874 --> 00:35:39,914
into the same pool of just generalized data.

794
00:35:39,914 --> 00:35:40,995
And I think that that is very important.

795
00:35:41,695 --> 00:35:45,337
And, okay, this is just a slight pivot,

796
00:35:45,337 --> 00:35:46,697
but I think it's gonna make everyone feel better.

797
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:48,478
Something I hear a lot is like,

798
00:35:48,478 --> 00:35:50,099
oh, in the future there's not gonna be any artists

799
00:35:50,099 --> 00:35:52,400
because there's just gonna be programmers writing AI

800
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:53,420
and that's it.

801
00:35:53,420 --> 00:35:54,841
And I'm so relieved to tell you

802
00:35:54,841 --> 00:35:56,261
this couldn't be further from the truth.

803
00:35:56,261 --> 00:35:58,142
In fact, it's probably the opposite.

804
00:35:58,142 --> 00:36:00,143
And so the statement I'm gonna tell you today,

805
00:36:00,143 --> 00:36:01,904
and sort of the case I'm gonna make for it,

806
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:04,065
is that the future of programming

807
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:06,186
is actually content creation.

808
00:36:06,186 --> 00:36:09,007
All of you are the programmers of tomorrow

809
00:36:09,007 --> 00:36:10,228
rather than the real programmers,

810
00:36:10,228 --> 00:36:10,408
which...

811
00:36:10,648 --> 00:36:13,249
Doesn't make much sense right now, but let me explain.

812
00:36:13,249 --> 00:36:15,911
First of all, conceptually, something that happens a lot

813
00:36:15,911 --> 00:36:17,352
and that is kind of a problem,

814
00:36:17,352 --> 00:36:18,793
and I'm sure you've felt it plenty

815
00:36:18,793 --> 00:36:21,194
having technical people build tools for artists.

816
00:36:21,194 --> 00:36:22,795
There's this gap of like, there's these people

817
00:36:22,795 --> 00:36:24,656
who know how to implement a solution,

818
00:36:24,656 --> 00:36:26,577
and then there's these people who have a problem.

819
00:36:26,577 --> 00:36:28,098
And then in the middle, there's like nothing,

820
00:36:28,098 --> 00:36:29,399
and then you're just shouting at each other

821
00:36:29,399 --> 00:36:30,519
and nobody understands what's going on,

822
00:36:30,519 --> 00:36:31,680
and then you get subpar tools

823
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:33,261
that kind of barely get the job done.

824
00:36:33,741 --> 00:36:36,822
And the problem is that people who understand the problem

825
00:36:36,822 --> 00:36:39,602
actually don't understand the solutions and vice versa.

826
00:36:39,602 --> 00:36:41,163
And so how do you solve that?

827
00:36:41,163 --> 00:36:44,963
And the fascinating thing is that I think this technology

828
00:36:44,963 --> 00:36:45,663
will actually help us do it.

829
00:36:45,663 --> 00:36:47,344
And then I'm gonna make another tangent

830
00:36:47,344 --> 00:36:48,044
that leads into this.

831
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:49,184
So bear with me, bear with me.

832
00:36:49,184 --> 00:36:51,585
Sounds very scary, but there's this concept

833
00:36:51,585 --> 00:36:53,545
that sounds really cool by the way, neuroevolution.

834
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:55,205
But it's basically based around the idea

835
00:36:55,205 --> 00:36:57,306
that artificial intelligence can kind of write itself.

836
00:36:58,026 --> 00:37:02,388
If you have a particular type of neural networks that you're building, then you can have another type of AI.

837
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:06,509
Just configure different types of neural networks for your particular task

838
00:37:06,509 --> 00:37:08,650
and figure out how to write a good neural network for you.

839
00:37:08,650 --> 00:37:12,411
And so this kind of caused a little bit of an upset in the programming community

840
00:37:12,411 --> 00:37:15,992
when Andrej Karpati, who's the head of AI at Tesla, basically tweeted that

841
00:37:15,992 --> 00:37:17,653
gradient descent is an optimization algorithm.

842
00:37:17,653 --> 00:37:20,394
He basically said that AI is going to write code better than humans will.

843
00:37:20,394 --> 00:37:22,395
And that's a programmer who does AI for a living.

844
00:37:23,355 --> 00:37:25,677
And the reason for that is very cool.

845
00:37:25,677 --> 00:37:28,198
And that's also a slide from his presentation.

846
00:37:28,198 --> 00:37:29,719
So when you're in academia, right,

847
00:37:29,719 --> 00:37:30,860
you're trying to make AI,

848
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,741
all you're doing is coming up with these fancy models

849
00:37:32,741 --> 00:37:33,822
and all of that crap.

850
00:37:33,822 --> 00:37:35,163
But the actual production realities of it,

851
00:37:35,163 --> 00:37:37,604
like when you're trying to teach a Tesla car

852
00:37:37,604 --> 00:37:39,245
to not turn on the wipers

853
00:37:39,245 --> 00:37:40,846
when you're pouring crackers on it or whatever,

854
00:37:40,846 --> 00:37:42,327
which people have tried on YouTube, by the way,

855
00:37:42,327 --> 00:37:44,468
it has auto wiper detection when there's rain.

856
00:37:44,468 --> 00:37:45,389
And there's like, will it wipe?

857
00:37:45,389 --> 00:37:47,170
YouTube videos, haven't seen them.

858
00:37:47,350 --> 00:37:48,071
Check them out.

859
00:37:48,071 --> 00:37:51,833
But basically, it is a fascinating area of research.

860
00:37:51,833 --> 00:37:54,535
But so in order to solve these problems,

861
00:37:54,535 --> 00:37:56,857
we're like, okay, have your car not drive over kittens

862
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:59,358
or something, like take something very mean.

863
00:37:59,358 --> 00:38:00,719
In order to do that right now, at Tesla,

864
00:38:00,719 --> 00:38:01,820
you don't write code.

865
00:38:01,820 --> 00:38:04,402
You basically go and take a bunch of pictures of kittens,

866
00:38:04,402 --> 00:38:06,964
mark them up, and say, hey, please don't ride over this.

867
00:38:06,964 --> 00:38:08,605
Or if you can take a picture of that,

868
00:38:08,605 --> 00:38:11,126
you actually build it in Unreal, show it the content,

869
00:38:11,126 --> 00:38:12,647
and say, hey, this is what you can do,

870
00:38:12,647 --> 00:38:13,788
this is what you cannot do.

871
00:38:13,788 --> 00:38:16,350
So the people programming the self-driving cars today,

872
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:19,493
For the most part, 75% of their time

873
00:38:19,493 --> 00:38:22,396
are concerned with making content, digital content,

874
00:38:22,396 --> 00:38:24,698
virtual content, to actually show it examples

875
00:38:24,698 --> 00:38:27,340
so that it knows what it can do and cannot do.

876
00:38:27,340 --> 00:38:29,943
And furthermore, there are actual services today.

877
00:38:29,943 --> 00:38:31,665
Like, Google has their Cloud AutoML

878
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:33,206
that builds image classifiers.

879
00:38:33,206 --> 00:38:34,628
Like, it's a type of neural network

880
00:38:34,628 --> 00:38:35,709
that you'll basically show an image

881
00:38:35,709 --> 00:38:37,811
and it will tell you if it's like a hot dog or not hot dog,

882
00:38:37,811 --> 00:38:38,752
basically.

883
00:38:38,752 --> 00:38:41,134
And you can train your own, like, is it elves or orcs

884
00:38:41,134 --> 00:38:41,855
or something like that.

885
00:38:42,055 --> 00:38:44,618
And the way you do it is literally you take a bunch of images, you put them in a folder,

886
00:38:44,618 --> 00:38:48,463
you upload it to Google Cloud, an hour later you come back and it has created a custom

887
00:38:48,463 --> 00:38:53,169
tailored AI model for your problem that you can use now via a link on their cloud.

888
00:38:53,169 --> 00:38:58,576
So you've basically created AI without ever writing a line of code, just by creating content.

889
00:38:58,576 --> 00:38:59,418
And so, you know.

890
00:39:00,426 --> 00:39:07,892
I rest my case. The future of programming is going to be content creation. When people say that everyone's going away about programmers, this couldn't be further from the true.

891
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:18,621
In fact, the opposite is true. We're going to need a lot of people building virtual worlds to help us make AI smarter, to help it build cool things, but also to just train it to the particular situations that you're trying to adapt it for.

892
00:39:18,621 --> 00:39:20,923
And so that is very interesting.

893
00:39:21,744 --> 00:39:23,325
if we were to continue with that metaphor,

894
00:39:23,325 --> 00:39:26,808
something that's very important through all of this

895
00:39:26,808 --> 00:39:30,931
is that future of art is kind of going to be art direction,

896
00:39:30,931 --> 00:39:33,954
which is pretty obvious on the surface,

897
00:39:33,954 --> 00:39:37,077
but I think something that happened with a lot of us

898
00:39:37,077 --> 00:39:39,118
is that as productions became more complex,

899
00:39:39,118 --> 00:39:41,921
they became more expensive, they started taking more time,

900
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:43,202
we saw more value in specializing

901
00:39:43,202 --> 00:39:45,043
because somebody needed to figure out

902
00:39:45,043 --> 00:39:46,785
how that ZBrush thing works or whatever else,

903
00:39:46,785 --> 00:39:47,806
how to do normal apps.

904
00:39:47,806 --> 00:39:49,607
And then after a while,

905
00:39:50,388 --> 00:39:51,428
you kind of realize that that

906
00:39:51,428 --> 00:39:52,769
part has nothing to do with

907
00:39:52,769 --> 00:39:54,169
art. Like the art part was the

908
00:39:54,169 --> 00:39:55,910
creative idea behind it. The

909
00:39:55,910 --> 00:39:57,290
shape language the forms the

910
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,631
color and all of that. And

911
00:39:58,631 --> 00:40:00,131
we've gotten so caught up in

912
00:40:00,131 --> 00:40:01,972
this where all of a sudden we

913
00:40:01,972 --> 00:40:04,453
equate ourself with our value

914
00:40:04,453 --> 00:40:05,933
as an artist with how well we

915
00:40:05,933 --> 00:40:07,394
unwrap things or how you know

916
00:40:07,394 --> 00:40:08,694
how clean our bakes are which

917
00:40:08,694 --> 00:40:10,115
once again kind of has nothing

918
00:40:10,115 --> 00:40:11,895
to do with it. And I think that

919
00:40:12,055 --> 00:40:18,158
As these processes that do not contribute value sort of fade away one by one. Something that I absolutely love about this

920
00:40:18,158 --> 00:40:23,281
technology is that it forces upon us this conversation. What do I actually do. What do I actually want to say. What is

921
00:40:23,281 --> 00:40:29,104
important to me as a creator. And Keith talked about value today this morning. I think that was very valid valuable. No

922
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:30,725
pun intended. Is that.

923
00:40:30,985 --> 00:40:32,947
We now get to re-inspect those.

924
00:40:32,947 --> 00:40:35,089
What got us into this in the first place?

925
00:40:35,089 --> 00:40:37,952
And how can we live out these values more through our work?

926
00:40:37,952 --> 00:40:39,494
And we, for the first time,

927
00:40:39,494 --> 00:40:41,716
will actually have the freedom to do that

928
00:40:41,716 --> 00:40:44,119
because of technology, which I find very fascinating.

929
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:46,621
And a good example that I really love is,

930
00:40:46,621 --> 00:40:48,323
if you haven't guessed so far, Blade Runner.

931
00:40:49,104 --> 00:40:52,686
So this is actual Blade Runner, the shot from the original movie.

932
00:40:52,686 --> 00:40:56,468
And up there, it's a Broadway downtown in Los Angeles, the street where they shot it

933
00:40:56,468 --> 00:40:56,508
at.

934
00:40:56,508 --> 00:41:00,690
And so Blade Runner is one of the most iconic visual movies ever.

935
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:04,312
And yet they did not have to build everything from scratch to make that movie.

936
00:41:04,312 --> 00:41:07,073
Nobody modeled a chair for the 28th time.

937
00:41:07,073 --> 00:41:09,835
Nobody, you know, created another exploding crate or whatever else.

938
00:41:10,295 --> 00:41:12,817
You take a piece of content that is there

939
00:41:12,817 --> 00:41:15,459
and then you adapt it to communicate a vision, right?

940
00:41:15,459 --> 00:41:17,040
If you're making a movie, you go on location,

941
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,483
you light it, you dress it, you add custom props

942
00:41:20,483 --> 00:41:22,084
that actually make sense for your fiction

943
00:41:22,084 --> 00:41:25,267
and then that is what's going to resonate with your audience

944
00:41:25,267 --> 00:41:27,188
and to me, I think that is very important

945
00:41:27,188 --> 00:41:29,870
because it's going to be more of what we are going

946
00:41:29,870 --> 00:41:30,611
to have to do.

947
00:41:30,611 --> 00:41:32,652
This is the value that we add as artists.

948
00:41:32,652 --> 00:41:34,013
When you're building your virtual world,

949
00:41:34,013 --> 00:41:36,335
it's not that you know how to move a triangle

950
00:41:36,335 --> 00:41:37,396
or a vertex or whatever else,

951
00:41:37,396 --> 00:41:39,578
it's that you actually know where to move it.

952
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:41,719
And so that's going to be the process,

953
00:41:41,719 --> 00:41:42,499
and it's very exciting.

954
00:41:42,499 --> 00:41:47,422
And shamelessly, this is the first ever GDC talk

955
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,442
that I did back in 2013,

956
00:41:48,442 --> 00:41:51,324
and it kind of echoed all the same subject,

957
00:41:51,324 --> 00:41:53,605
is that at some point, we will be able

958
00:41:53,605 --> 00:41:55,786
to create absolutely everything in the world.

959
00:41:55,786 --> 00:41:58,127
And at 2013, it seemed kind of pretty far out.

960
00:41:58,127 --> 00:42:00,448
Now it seems a little closer.

961
00:42:00,849 --> 00:42:03,271
inevitable and it's all going to happen within your lifetime.

962
00:42:03,271 --> 00:42:07,476
You're going to be able to create any kind of virtual world to the level of fidelity that you want to.

963
00:42:07,476 --> 00:42:10,860
And then the question is, what are you actually going to create?

964
00:42:10,860 --> 00:42:13,903
Right, because just replicating reality couldn't be more boring.

965
00:42:13,903 --> 00:42:15,946
I don't want to look at another parking garage or...

966
00:42:16,306 --> 00:42:17,867
the things that I look at in life.

967
00:42:17,867 --> 00:42:19,869
The value that all of you bring to the table

968
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,270
is actually putting a twist on it,

969
00:42:21,270 --> 00:42:23,512
figuring out how to actually transform it

970
00:42:23,512 --> 00:42:25,393
in a way that's going to be meaningful for your audience.

971
00:42:25,393 --> 00:42:27,415
And there's been a lot of interesting conversations

972
00:42:27,415 --> 00:42:28,876
today during the bootcamp about this.

973
00:42:28,876 --> 00:42:30,617
I'll hopefully give you some inspiration on this.

974
00:42:30,617 --> 00:42:33,179
But I think that that is very important.

975
00:42:33,179 --> 00:42:35,301
And I'm gonna quote Pablo Picasso here.

976
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:42,008
He had a very fascinating quote in the 50s where he said that computers are useless because they only give you answers. And I

977
00:42:42,008 --> 00:42:48,895
think that that really hits home on what we do as creative people because our job is not to have answers to a particular

978
00:42:48,895 --> 00:42:54,300
problem. It's actually knowing which questions to ask because the questions are the valuable part. And you know the public

979
00:42:54,300 --> 00:42:57,423
because it was smart because you can tell from the picture.

980
00:42:59,314 --> 00:43:01,275
But I think that's what this brings us towards.

981
00:43:01,275 --> 00:43:03,337
This brings us to the realization

982
00:43:03,337 --> 00:43:07,139
that we actually need to focus not just on methodologies

983
00:43:07,139 --> 00:43:09,741
or processes or knowing which buttons to click,

984
00:43:09,741 --> 00:43:13,363
but the actual focus on knowing which questions to ask.

985
00:43:13,363 --> 00:43:14,804
And I'm gonna propose you some.

986
00:43:14,804 --> 00:43:16,606
How about where's the value in what I do?

987
00:43:17,206 --> 00:43:22,809
That is the number one thing and you know it's going to be different for every artist. Some artists are fantastic with color for

988
00:43:22,809 --> 00:43:28,512
example and they just want to drive that point home and sort of stimulate you in a way that's consistent with that. Some

989
00:43:28,512 --> 00:43:35,476
actually just want to straight string together stories and compositions and that's perfectly fine. You can focus on that. But

990
00:43:35,476 --> 00:43:36,937
the question that you cannot.

991
00:43:37,177 --> 00:43:42,179
not ask yourself is basically that because if you don't then you're not going to know what to do once

992
00:43:42,179 --> 00:43:47,401
all of the sort of extraneous processes just fall away. This amount of introspection that is forced

993
00:43:47,401 --> 00:43:53,063
on us by technology is fascinating because it gets philosophical really quickly but it's also kind of

994
00:43:53,063 --> 00:43:57,465
really exciting because that's literally who we are. We are artists and yet we don't know what

995
00:43:57,465 --> 00:44:01,826
that means and we'll have to figure it out really quickly which is which is really exciting.

996
00:44:02,347 --> 00:44:05,569
And then the next question is a little bit more pragmatic,

997
00:44:05,569 --> 00:44:06,970
but I think it's relevant.

998
00:44:06,970 --> 00:44:09,692
There are things that you think are a value add,

999
00:44:09,692 --> 00:44:10,913
but then the other question is,

1000
00:44:10,913 --> 00:44:12,154
what does your audience think?

1001
00:44:12,154 --> 00:44:13,995
Do they agree with what your value add is?

1002
00:44:13,995 --> 00:44:16,257
Because there are some people who absolutely love

1003
00:44:16,257 --> 00:44:17,498
whatever, modeling crates,

1004
00:44:17,498 --> 00:44:18,639
and there's nothing wrong with that,

1005
00:44:18,639 --> 00:44:20,841
but it's going to be very hard to do this for a living

1006
00:44:20,841 --> 00:44:21,761
if everyone else doesn't care.

1007
00:44:22,442 --> 00:44:23,883
At that point, it's a hobby.

1008
00:44:23,883 --> 00:44:25,765
And that is a very important distinction

1009
00:44:25,765 --> 00:44:29,348
that you will have to make is, OK, what am I in love with here?

1010
00:44:29,348 --> 00:44:30,549
Am I in love with building worlds?

1011
00:44:30,549 --> 00:44:32,751
Am I in love with a particular process that might exist?

1012
00:44:32,751 --> 00:44:34,713
There are people making pottery by hand.

1013
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:38,516
And it doesn't scale, but it's a thing.

1014
00:44:38,516 --> 00:44:39,277
And you can still pursue it.

1015
00:44:39,277 --> 00:44:40,318
And if you do it well enough, you'll

1016
00:44:40,318 --> 00:44:41,118
make a living off of it.

1017
00:44:41,118 --> 00:44:43,420
But it's just something that you unfortunately

1018
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:44,061
need to think about.

1019
00:44:44,965 --> 00:44:47,746
And then the other question that is potentially

1020
00:44:47,746 --> 00:44:48,926
at the intersection of the two is,

1021
00:44:48,926 --> 00:44:50,806
if there's something that I love doing,

1022
00:44:50,806 --> 00:44:53,227
just hopefully building worlds and, you know,

1023
00:44:53,227 --> 00:44:54,367
trying to inspire other people,

1024
00:44:54,367 --> 00:44:56,688
and then people actually wanna pay money for it,

1025
00:44:56,688 --> 00:44:57,908
how can I focus on that more?

1026
00:44:57,908 --> 00:45:01,449
Because this is, literally, these three questions

1027
00:45:01,449 --> 00:45:02,829
are gonna drive how your work is going to change

1028
00:45:02,829 --> 00:45:03,529
years from now.

1029
00:45:03,529 --> 00:45:05,269
Or, I mean, maybe weeks from now, who knows?

1030
00:45:05,269 --> 00:45:08,050
But basically, these things are fundamental,

1031
00:45:08,050 --> 00:45:09,890
they're going to be behind that.

1032
00:45:11,159 --> 00:45:15,764
bring home that point is that through all of that this basically forces you to distill what is art

1033
00:45:15,764 --> 00:45:23,814
for you which I think is very interesting and for me the thing that I love about it most having spent

1034
00:45:23,814 --> 00:45:28,140
a decade trying my best to serve artists and not wreck microphones is that.

1035
00:45:29,582 --> 00:45:36,091
Artificial intelligence fundamentally if we do this right and if is a very big if and that's important is a great power amplifier

1036
00:45:36,091 --> 00:45:38,935
But what needs to happen is you need to be informed about it

1037
00:45:38,935 --> 00:45:44,183
And you need to demand that it's the power amplifier that you deserve you need to actually be vocal in

1038
00:45:44,543 --> 00:45:47,225
communicating the needs for technology that you have.

1039
00:45:47,225 --> 00:45:49,926
Because, you know, the masters of old made their own paints

1040
00:45:49,926 --> 00:45:51,606
and mixed their own colors and all of that,

1041
00:45:51,606 --> 00:45:53,487
because it was important to know your tools.

1042
00:45:53,487 --> 00:45:54,928
Right now, they're so incredibly complex

1043
00:45:54,928 --> 00:45:57,629
that it's borderline impossible to expect people

1044
00:45:57,629 --> 00:46:00,070
to have, you know, competence in producing these tools.

1045
00:46:00,070 --> 00:46:01,730
But what you actually have is the knowledge

1046
00:46:01,730 --> 00:46:03,391
of the problems that they have to solve.

1047
00:46:03,391 --> 00:46:04,151
And that is paramount,

1048
00:46:04,151 --> 00:46:07,253
and that needs to be vocalized as much as possible.

1049
00:46:07,253 --> 00:46:10,894
And then just going back to that idea of something that...

1050
00:46:11,054 --> 00:46:15,659
It really warms my heart as someone who worked hard to try and empower artists is that this

1051
00:46:15,659 --> 00:46:20,423
technology whether you like it or not will make it a lot harder to be insignificant.

1052
00:46:20,423 --> 00:46:23,727
You can't just sit in a corner make your UVs and just expect to make your paycheck and

1053
00:46:23,727 --> 00:46:24,087
go home.

1054
00:46:24,752 --> 00:46:28,015
it's a power amplifier, which means that, you know,

1055
00:46:28,015 --> 00:46:29,376
now you'll have to embrace it.

1056
00:46:29,376 --> 00:46:33,138
Now you will actually have to tell stories and build worlds

1057
00:46:33,138 --> 00:46:37,221
and bring everything, every ounce of your personality

1058
00:46:37,221 --> 00:46:39,623
and your inspiration and the things that made you

1059
00:46:39,623 --> 00:46:42,105
wanna do this in the first place into your workplace

1060
00:46:42,105 --> 00:46:43,846
and start realizing that they're important,

1061
00:46:43,846 --> 00:46:46,268
that you are important, that what you have to say

1062
00:46:46,268 --> 00:46:48,389
is valuable and you don't just have to sit there

1063
00:46:48,389 --> 00:46:49,730
and assume that all you're gonna do

1064
00:46:49,730 --> 00:46:51,611
for your entire creative career, just...

1065
00:46:51,932 --> 00:46:53,654
pick which type of crate you're going to model.

1066
00:46:53,654 --> 00:46:56,358
And I know a hammer and crates a lot, but you get the point.

1067
00:46:56,358 --> 00:47:00,544
And so if there is a takeaway from this entire presentation

1068
00:47:00,544 --> 00:47:01,445
is that.

1069
00:47:02,027 --> 00:47:04,589
I really hope that you can start applying that logic now.

1070
00:47:04,589 --> 00:47:06,530
You can start realizing that what you have to say

1071
00:47:06,530 --> 00:47:07,350
actually has value.

1072
00:47:07,350 --> 00:47:09,452
You can start thinking about what are you going to say

1073
00:47:09,452 --> 00:47:10,312
when the time comes,

1074
00:47:10,312 --> 00:47:12,573
because it's gonna come sooner than you think.

1075
00:47:12,573 --> 00:47:14,475
And then when the time is right,

1076
00:47:14,475 --> 00:47:17,296
you're gonna shoot for the moon and make amazing things,

1077
00:47:17,296 --> 00:47:20,218
but also demand that the tools that people are making

1078
00:47:20,218 --> 00:47:24,240
for you are actually deserving of your inspiration

1079
00:47:24,240 --> 00:47:25,501
and your creativity.

1080
00:47:25,501 --> 00:47:26,682
That's all I got.

1081
00:47:26,682 --> 00:47:27,342
Thank you so much.

1082
00:47:37,993 --> 00:47:41,094
We have like 10 minutes for questions if anybody has some,

1083
00:47:41,094 --> 00:47:43,794
or if you just want to throw something at me for making AI.

1084
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:49,496
I guess my question would be, how do we start using it?

1085
00:47:49,496 --> 00:47:53,497
So like, as a lead artist, one of the things

1086
00:47:53,497 --> 00:47:57,918
that's very important to me is eliminating all crunch,

1087
00:47:57,918 --> 00:48:00,998
while at the same time not limiting creativity,

1088
00:48:00,998 --> 00:48:03,239
and those things don't go very well together at all.

1089
00:48:03,939 --> 00:48:06,362
So we're always looking for ways to improve pipelines

1090
00:48:06,362 --> 00:48:09,486
in Houdini and procedural texturing is a way to do that.

1091
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,089
But I can already kind of see the pipeline

1092
00:48:12,089 --> 00:48:14,912
for an AI workflow in my brain, but I can't.

1093
00:48:14,912 --> 00:48:15,974
How do I get into it?

1094
00:48:15,974 --> 00:48:17,055
Like how do you start using it?

1095
00:48:17,055 --> 00:48:18,337
No, that is a very good question.

1096
00:48:18,337 --> 00:48:19,238
It's definitely very nice.

1097
00:48:19,238 --> 00:48:20,539
And something that I'm gonna say actually

1098
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:21,500
that I think is really important

1099
00:48:21,500 --> 00:48:22,962
talking about procedural pipelines.

1100
00:48:23,082 --> 00:48:26,144
where I think conceptually they're not gonna have

1101
00:48:26,144 --> 00:48:27,264
the longevity that we expect.

1102
00:48:27,264 --> 00:48:29,265
They're a very worthwhile investment right now,

1103
00:48:29,265 --> 00:48:31,687
but something that happens with them is that

1104
00:48:31,687 --> 00:48:34,868
conceptually the people creating procedural pipelines

1105
00:48:34,868 --> 00:48:36,629
are not the people who have the core expertise

1106
00:48:36,629 --> 00:48:37,470
in the problem.

1107
00:48:37,470 --> 00:48:39,471
So you're a tech artist, you're a programmer,

1108
00:48:39,471 --> 00:48:40,251
you know how to write code,

1109
00:48:40,251 --> 00:48:42,092
you're gonna give me three sliders to make my art.

1110
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:43,393
That is basically the process.

1111
00:48:43,393 --> 00:48:45,394
And then there's like some back and forth with like,

1112
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:47,355
okay, I kind of tell you how to fix it.

1113
00:48:47,355 --> 00:48:48,635
But conceptually, once again,

1114
00:48:48,635 --> 00:48:49,836
this is not the best way to do it.

1115
00:48:49,836 --> 00:48:50,916
Because for example,

1116
00:48:50,916 --> 00:48:53,098
the way we do it internally with Promethean, right,

1117
00:48:53,098 --> 00:48:54,658
is you build environments,

1118
00:48:54,658 --> 00:48:55,619
it learns from that,

1119
00:48:55,619 --> 00:48:57,180
and then it reflects that back at you.

1120
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,041
So the people producing the art

1121
00:48:59,041 --> 00:49:01,322
and people executing on the core competence

1122
00:49:01,322 --> 00:49:02,922
are the programmers of the technology

1123
00:49:02,922 --> 00:49:04,423
that is going to empower them.

1124
00:49:04,423 --> 00:49:05,784
And I think conceptually that is.

1125
00:49:06,284 --> 00:49:09,327
just long term a much better approach not just in games everywhere.

1126
00:49:09,327 --> 00:49:13,110
If we can have people who who have the knowledge of all of this problem solving

1127
00:49:13,110 --> 00:49:17,174
actually be the creators of their own empowerment that is that much more worth

1128
00:49:17,174 --> 00:49:19,797
it and on how to create it or how to how to get into it.

1129
00:49:19,797 --> 00:49:22,459
It's going to take a little bit more time where you.

1130
00:49:22,579 --> 00:49:25,402
By the way, super welcome to reach out to, obviously, us.

1131
00:49:25,402 --> 00:49:27,284
We're working with a bunch of game studios

1132
00:49:27,284 --> 00:49:28,786
and sort of working through these steps

1133
00:49:28,786 --> 00:49:30,608
and trying to empower people to make content.

1134
00:49:30,608 --> 00:49:33,010
But as far as this general rollout,

1135
00:49:33,010 --> 00:49:34,392
I think it's going to take a little bit,

1136
00:49:34,392 --> 00:49:36,114
but probably not as long as you think.

1137
00:49:36,114 --> 00:49:38,096
I'd say a year or two, where most people

1138
00:49:38,096 --> 00:49:39,317
will be able to get into it.

1139
00:49:39,798 --> 00:49:41,520
So that would be my prognosis.

1140
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:41,961
Oh, hello.

1141
00:49:41,961 --> 00:49:42,401
Hey.

1142
00:49:42,401 --> 00:49:43,262
Sorry.

1143
00:49:43,262 --> 00:49:44,924
Fascinating talk.

1144
00:49:44,924 --> 00:49:45,285
Thank you.

1145
00:49:45,285 --> 00:49:53,235
I have a question which is kind of an open-ended question, I guess, but it relates to, let's

1146
00:49:53,235 --> 00:49:54,977
call it expectation creep.

1147
00:49:55,157 --> 00:49:56,738
It's basically, if you look at PS1 games

1148
00:49:56,738 --> 00:49:58,439
and how they looked like, I mean,

1149
00:49:58,439 --> 00:50:00,301
it's not like the people who created it

1150
00:50:00,301 --> 00:50:03,823
were less talented than people are nowadays,

1151
00:50:03,823 --> 00:50:06,965
it's just they had worse tools than people have nowadays.

1152
00:50:06,965 --> 00:50:09,987
So if we look at AI as just another tool

1153
00:50:09,987 --> 00:50:12,688
to make things more effective,

1154
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:15,530
what, to just boil it down to one simple question,

1155
00:50:15,530 --> 00:50:22,314
what gives you the impression basically

1156
00:50:22,314 --> 00:50:22,915
that the,

1157
00:50:23,775 --> 00:50:29,402
a new workflow won't be me sitting in the office just feeding the AI till 1am?

1158
00:50:29,402 --> 00:50:34,848
Oh that's a great question in fact I get it a lot and it's basically the question is conceptually

1159
00:50:34,848 --> 00:50:40,574
won't we just crunch more with different tools if I were to replace that and the answer is actually

1160
00:50:40,574 --> 00:50:41,014
money.

1161
00:50:41,335 --> 00:50:43,856
which is fascinating because if you're making,

1162
00:50:43,856 --> 00:50:46,257
so right now we're making a 40-hour game and it's big

1163
00:50:46,257 --> 00:50:47,518
and everyone's content and no one's saying,

1164
00:50:47,518 --> 00:50:48,819
hey, I need a bigger game.

1165
00:50:48,819 --> 00:50:50,599
If at some point, instead of making a 40-hour game,

1166
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:51,780
you're making an 80-hour game,

1167
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:53,341
what you're doing is you're doubling your cost

1168
00:50:53,341 --> 00:50:55,722
without potentially increasing your profit at all.

1169
00:50:55,722 --> 00:50:57,983
And so there's going to be some sweet spot

1170
00:50:57,983 --> 00:50:59,724
that is going to figure it out of like,

1171
00:50:59,724 --> 00:51:03,066
you can work more, but what that means is you're just.

1172
00:51:03,346 --> 00:51:04,526
wasting time potentially.

1173
00:51:04,526 --> 00:51:05,547
So it's way more self-indulgent.

1174
00:51:05,547 --> 00:51:08,127
And I think actually it's very useful for an artist

1175
00:51:08,127 --> 00:51:10,828
to keep track of that because sometimes

1176
00:51:10,828 --> 00:51:13,388
it's actually a good rebuttal for feature creep

1177
00:51:13,388 --> 00:51:14,929
that comes from game designers or producers

1178
00:51:14,929 --> 00:51:16,529
when they're like, oh we need 25 times more content.

1179
00:51:16,529 --> 00:51:19,010
And you go, can you prove me that this will have

1180
00:51:19,010 --> 00:51:21,230
any significant value on the return of the game,

1181
00:51:21,230 --> 00:51:22,111
for example.

1182
00:51:22,111 --> 00:51:23,871
But the other thing that is important

1183
00:51:23,871 --> 00:51:27,852
that applies to this that I had

1184
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,013
and that I think I totally forgotten was

1185
00:51:32,314 --> 00:51:32,894
Yeah, I don't remember.

1186
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:33,835
Sorry, I had a second point,

1187
00:51:33,835 --> 00:51:34,915
but feel free to come by after this

1188
00:51:34,915 --> 00:51:36,236
and maybe I'll remember.

1189
00:51:36,236 --> 00:51:36,796
Okay, love to.

1190
00:51:36,796 --> 00:51:38,017
Thank you.

1191
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:42,500
Me and my friend tried to make a graphic novel.

1192
00:51:43,827 --> 00:51:50,691
those technologies seems like we can invest in our sketch or our artwork.

1193
00:51:50,691 --> 00:52:00,117
My question is, does AI require super expensive hardware like a high quality GPU or CPUs?

1194
00:52:00,977 --> 00:52:04,379
You'd be surprised at how performance friendly this can be.

1195
00:52:04,379 --> 00:52:07,822
There's a lot of purpose-built hardware

1196
00:52:07,822 --> 00:52:11,264
that's being released these days with whatever TensorBoards

1197
00:52:11,264 --> 00:52:12,305
and units and stuff like that.

1198
00:52:12,305 --> 00:52:13,766
But a lot of it can be run on GPU.

1199
00:52:13,766 --> 00:52:15,327
But also, it's costly when you're

1200
00:52:15,327 --> 00:52:17,668
trying to do it for every frame when you're doing it

1201
00:52:17,668 --> 00:52:18,769
in real time for a video game.

1202
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:21,691
And that's what NVIDIA tries to have you pay a lot of money for.

1203
00:52:22,271 --> 00:52:24,512
But if you're just using it as a tool

1204
00:52:24,512 --> 00:52:25,812
that you can just run once,

1205
00:52:25,812 --> 00:52:27,312
then it's actually reasonably fast.

1206
00:52:27,312 --> 00:52:29,473
Like I don't think you're gonna be very hard-pressed

1207
00:52:29,473 --> 00:52:32,654
to find modern day hardware that works with it okay.

1208
00:52:32,654 --> 00:52:33,994
So.

1209
00:52:33,994 --> 00:52:34,354
Thank you.

1210
00:52:34,354 --> 00:52:35,115
Yeah, of course.

1211
00:52:35,115 --> 00:52:35,255
Hello.

1212
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:36,955
Well, first off, thanks for the talk.

1213
00:52:36,955 --> 00:52:41,096
I always appreciate your talks, they're awesome.

1214
00:52:41,096 --> 00:52:41,596
Thank you.

1215
00:52:42,962 --> 00:52:49,065
So I was just wondering if procedural tools can help bootstrap more advanced AI systems

1216
00:52:49,065 --> 00:52:54,167
because you have inputs and outputs and you could tell it what's good and bad.

1217
00:52:54,167 --> 00:52:56,208
So I mean do you think that's a potential for...

1218
00:52:56,774 --> 00:53:02,740
I totally think so. It's interesting. You know we had this conversation recently and the question was essential

1219
00:53:02,740 --> 00:53:09,366
essentially about efficiency. Right. And if you look at the internal combustion engine its efficiency in transforming fuel into

1220
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:16,233
actual motion is about 20 percent 80 percent of the energy is lost to just heat and just being 20 percent effective is

1221
00:53:16,233 --> 00:53:18,636
enough to fundamentally transform the world to do.

1222
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,187
these amazing things that we couldn't do before.

1223
00:53:21,187 --> 00:53:23,029
And so conceptually that's fascinating,

1224
00:53:23,029 --> 00:53:26,013
but that's where you're not gonna get AI day one

1225
00:53:26,013 --> 00:53:28,056
that's like, here's a final thing for you

1226
00:53:28,056 --> 00:53:29,578
from just like three button clicks.

1227
00:53:29,578 --> 00:53:31,281
What's gonna happen is you're gonna have a tool

1228
00:53:31,281 --> 00:53:33,624
that's gonna accelerate your workflow 10%,

1229
00:53:33,624 --> 00:53:34,125
then 20%, then 30%.

1230
00:53:34,125 --> 00:53:36,268
And so yeah, you might be able to kickstart it

1231
00:53:36,268 --> 00:53:37,089
with like a.

1232
00:53:37,469 --> 00:53:39,650
a procedural, whatever, like substance-based

1233
00:53:39,650 --> 00:53:41,851
texture pipeline that then you feed into this system

1234
00:53:41,851 --> 00:53:44,012
that then accelerates your workflow a little bit more

1235
00:53:44,012 --> 00:53:44,572
and a little bit more.

1236
00:53:44,572 --> 00:53:45,972
But something else that's really exciting about this,

1237
00:53:45,972 --> 00:53:48,233
there's this concept of a positive feedback loop.

1238
00:53:48,233 --> 00:53:50,674
Every time you use it and then you change it

1239
00:53:50,674 --> 00:53:52,035
and you correct it, you basically go,

1240
00:53:52,035 --> 00:53:53,835
okay, now learn this.

1241
00:53:53,835 --> 00:53:55,996
And now you've increased the amount of data that you have.

1242
00:53:55,996 --> 00:53:57,957
And so the more you use it, the more it actually learns

1243
00:53:57,957 --> 00:53:59,538
from you and the better it becomes,

1244
00:53:59,538 --> 00:54:02,139
which is very unlike any other tools that you will use.

1245
00:54:02,139 --> 00:54:02,759
And so that's...

1246
00:54:03,479 --> 00:54:05,361
Yeah, you're absolutely right in that point,

1247
00:54:05,361 --> 00:54:07,823
and I think there's just more to it that will basically,

1248
00:54:07,823 --> 00:54:09,565
once we sort of get the ball rolling,

1249
00:54:09,565 --> 00:54:12,928
it's gonna snowball pretty fast.

1250
00:54:12,928 --> 00:54:15,030
Thank you.

1251
00:54:15,030 --> 00:54:15,470
Thank you.

1252
00:54:17,089 --> 00:54:17,810
Hi, really great talk.

1253
00:54:17,810 --> 00:54:18,130
Thank you.

1254
00:54:18,130 --> 00:54:22,755
Do you have maybe an example, you being in that field

1255
00:54:22,755 --> 00:54:25,518
of any games that are out that you can point to

1256
00:54:25,518 --> 00:54:28,441
like a system where this has been applied?

1257
00:54:28,441 --> 00:54:30,943
Well, like the one on the surfaces,

1258
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:32,805
Remedy uses a bunch of like facial animation

1259
00:54:32,805 --> 00:54:35,688
where they can just convert video to actual animation

1260
00:54:35,688 --> 00:54:37,230
per character and they use it based on

1261
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:38,491
like neural network solvers.

1262
00:54:38,992 --> 00:54:42,293
So that's a simple one, and that's in content creation.

1263
00:54:42,293 --> 00:54:45,394
And then there's a lot of use cases around,

1264
00:54:45,394 --> 00:54:48,195
like Ubisoft has this division called LaForge,

1265
00:54:48,195 --> 00:54:50,756
and they do a lot of also facial animation

1266
00:54:50,756 --> 00:54:54,057
from different text based on different languages.

1267
00:54:54,057 --> 00:54:55,457
So in different Assassin's Creed games,

1268
00:54:55,457 --> 00:54:56,137
depending on the language,

1269
00:54:56,137 --> 00:54:57,258
it'll just auto-generate facial animation.

1270
00:54:57,258 --> 00:54:58,958
So stuff like that, but it's interesting

1271
00:54:58,958 --> 00:55:00,739
because there are two main fields

1272
00:55:00,739 --> 00:55:02,039
that people are researching right now

1273
00:55:02,039 --> 00:55:04,460
outside of content, which is testing,

1274
00:55:04,460 --> 00:55:05,560
because the games are so big,

1275
00:55:05,560 --> 00:55:07,301
nobody can actually effectively test them.

1276
00:55:07,301 --> 00:55:08,521
There are areas of like...

1277
00:55:09,282 --> 00:55:15,045
Assassin's Creed games that like literally no tester has ever been to potentially or like tested a particular counter in and all of that stuff

1278
00:55:15,045 --> 00:55:18,987
And then there are other parts of this that are gameplay, which I'm super happy about

1279
00:55:18,987 --> 00:55:24,629
So something that valve did that was brilliant and like what left for that to where they had the director concept of there was this?

1280
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:29,952
Hard-coded AI that basically figured out how exciting the game is for you based on a set of metrics and then I was like

1281
00:55:29,952 --> 00:55:31,933
Oh, you look like you don't have enough of a challenge

1282
00:55:31,933 --> 00:55:34,014
Let me throw in some zombies in here and then you're you know

1283
00:55:34,314 --> 00:55:38,237
cursing it left and right and screaming at your friends over the network and it was a lot of fun.

1284
00:55:38,237 --> 00:55:42,601
But that's basically that concept kind of hasn't been tried much afterwards and now people are

1285
00:55:42,601 --> 00:55:47,965
investigating more where you can have an AI game master essentially over your virtual you know D&D

1286
00:55:47,965 --> 00:55:51,508
game that is actually just a 3D interactive experience and I think that is really cool

1287
00:55:51,508 --> 00:55:55,511
because that enhances the core competence and while there's research there's different types

1288
00:55:55,511 --> 00:55:59,875
of games that use that you can really easily do it for like a racing game right where you

1289
00:55:59,875 --> 00:56:00,595
can train a model.

1290
00:56:00,895 --> 00:56:03,577
that is reinforcement learning basically,

1291
00:56:03,577 --> 00:56:05,899
or anything competitive with a limited set of inputs

1292
00:56:05,899 --> 00:56:08,040
you can probably do today convincingly well.

1293
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:09,301
But you know what the scary part is?

1294
00:56:09,301 --> 00:56:11,843
When you start doing these reinforcement learning models,

1295
00:56:11,843 --> 00:56:12,864
they actually learn from the player

1296
00:56:12,864 --> 00:56:14,865
and so they will inevitably learn how to beat it.

1297
00:56:14,865 --> 00:56:16,947
So then the problem is how do we actually make it fun now?

1298
00:56:16,947 --> 00:56:18,207
Because you can teach it how to play,

1299
00:56:18,207 --> 00:56:19,128
it'll play really well,

1300
00:56:19,128 --> 00:56:21,129
it's just that no human will want to play it.

1301
00:56:21,129 --> 00:56:23,831
So it's a different set of problems.

1302
00:56:23,831 --> 00:56:24,272
Thank you.

1303
00:56:24,272 --> 00:56:24,932
No, my pleasure.

1304
00:56:25,623 --> 00:56:31,245
Hey. So my question was, there are a lot of games that are not,

1305
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:37,228
their structure is not based on this story. So they're more on level design or not even level

1306
00:56:37,228 --> 00:56:44,411
design, just shoot, kill and go forward. So do you think later on it's going to be more like,

1307
00:56:44,411 --> 00:56:51,515
it's going to be more valuable to make story in games or things like that?

1308
00:56:51,842 --> 00:56:53,104
I'm so happy you asked that.

1309
00:56:53,104 --> 00:56:55,346
Because I think something that's really important,

1310
00:56:55,346 --> 00:56:57,088
and that's going back to that concept of like,

1311
00:56:57,088 --> 00:56:58,230
if we were the movie industry,

1312
00:56:58,230 --> 00:56:59,812
we can literally only make Spider-Man games,

1313
00:56:59,812 --> 00:57:01,454
or whatever, like superhero movies.

1314
00:57:01,454 --> 00:57:03,896
Because I don't know what the equivalent

1315
00:57:03,896 --> 00:57:06,059
of like a good will hunting is in video games,

1316
00:57:06,059 --> 00:57:08,762
or like a million other amazing, dramatic.

1317
00:57:09,363 --> 00:57:12,407
fascinating, gripping stories that are absolutely life changing.

1318
00:57:12,407 --> 00:57:16,934
And if we can dramatically improve that, what's going to happen is we're going to

1319
00:57:16,934 --> 00:57:20,379
dramatically expand the amount of people enjoying video games, because right now

1320
00:57:20,379 --> 00:57:22,782
there's a limited amount of people.

1321
00:57:22,782 --> 00:57:24,305
And, you know, you talk to.

1322
00:57:24,365 --> 00:57:27,486
A lot of people, you know, they're on the financial side and they go, no,

1323
00:57:27,486 --> 00:57:29,067
video games grow so much money.

1324
00:57:29,067 --> 00:57:31,228
We have everyone's playing Candy Crush.

1325
00:57:31,228 --> 00:57:32,709
Great. Everyone's playing Candy Crush.

1326
00:57:32,709 --> 00:57:35,970
But if we can figure out a way to actually give people an experience

1327
00:57:35,970 --> 00:57:37,071
that they can relate to,

1328
00:57:37,071 --> 00:57:39,872
that is of enough quality that they can see themselves in it

1329
00:57:39,872 --> 00:57:43,234
and it gives them an interactive view on what their life is like

1330
00:57:43,234 --> 00:57:46,515
or someone they know life is like and just let them experience something

1331
00:57:46,515 --> 00:57:48,976
in a way that wasn't possible before that doesn't involve

1332
00:57:48,976 --> 00:57:50,497
blowing everyone's brains out,

1333
00:57:50,497 --> 00:57:52,978
then I think we're just going to have a lot more people.

1334
00:57:53,038 --> 00:57:56,760
actually enjoying that and I think that that's great because even the word game is kind of

1335
00:57:56,760 --> 00:58:00,242
antiquated in a way because fundamentally what we're trying to do is we're trying to

1336
00:58:00,242 --> 00:58:05,065
take you on a journey we're trying to give you an experience and then whatever that experience

1337
00:58:05,065 --> 00:58:08,767
is it doesn't have to have rules it doesn't have to have as you mentioned like a linear

1338
00:58:08,767 --> 00:58:12,229
structure it's all about what do you want people to do and it's weird and it's kind

1339
00:58:12,229 --> 00:58:15,610
of off tangent but I think it's extremely valuable because it ties into that Walmart

1340
00:58:15,610 --> 00:58:18,812
does training for its employees in VR like interactively.

1341
00:58:19,092 --> 00:58:23,497
And one of the things they do is they actually have them fire someone as part of their management training in VR.

1342
00:58:23,497 --> 00:58:29,543
But then what they do with that is as you're firing someone in VR, they actually capture your performance.

1343
00:58:29,543 --> 00:58:36,710
And then the next stage of your training is you're actually sitting there as an employee watching you fire yourself.

1344
00:58:38,982 --> 00:58:41,842
And the ability to create interactive experiences like that,

1345
00:58:41,842 --> 00:58:45,723
that are actually going to speak to us as humans,

1346
00:58:45,723 --> 00:58:47,483
and actually allow us to experience

1347
00:58:47,483 --> 00:58:50,004
what it's like being in someone else's shoes,

1348
00:58:50,004 --> 00:58:52,724
are kind of sort of paywall locked

1349
00:58:52,724 --> 00:58:55,505
behind the ridiculously expensive production costs.

1350
00:58:55,505 --> 00:58:58,305
And once that dissipates, there's so much social value

1351
00:58:58,305 --> 00:58:59,705
that is going to be ungated by this,

1352
00:58:59,705 --> 00:59:01,586
where we're like, oh, we can do all of these things

1353
00:59:01,586 --> 00:59:03,866
to actually understand each other better as humans

1354
00:59:03,866 --> 00:59:06,106
and not be assholes, which is valuable.

1355
00:59:06,987 --> 00:59:09,188
I'm sorry, I rant, but yes.

1356
00:59:09,188 --> 00:59:10,609
So the short answer is yes.

1357
00:59:10,609 --> 00:59:12,850
My other question is if we have time.

1358
00:59:12,850 --> 00:59:13,330
Of course.

1359
00:59:13,330 --> 00:59:19,973
Was, so the structure that you talked about in terms of just

1360
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,335
image processing and everything, we have the same

1361
00:59:22,335 --> 00:59:24,196
structure in literature.

1362
00:59:25,055 --> 00:59:28,599
we have literature, books, stories for thousands of years.

1363
00:59:28,599 --> 00:59:32,122
So we have those structures.

1364
00:59:32,122 --> 00:59:35,266
So do you think in future we're gonna have

1365
00:59:35,266 --> 00:59:36,747
stories made by AI?

1366
00:59:36,747 --> 00:59:39,210
Oh dude, let me tell you.

1367
00:59:39,210 --> 00:59:39,490
Sorry.

1368
00:59:40,325 --> 00:59:41,686
I literally, I was lucky enough to hang out

1369
00:59:41,686 --> 00:59:43,347
with someone from OpenAI recently.

1370
00:59:43,347 --> 00:59:45,488
And OpenAI did that research where they created this model

1371
00:59:45,488 --> 00:59:49,029
that basically you give it a couple of sentences

1372
00:59:49,029 --> 00:59:50,670
and it continues the text for you

1373
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:52,511
and it can go on for pages and pages,

1374
00:59:52,511 --> 00:59:54,271
it writes you an essay.

1375
00:59:54,271 --> 00:59:56,392
And we've given it like two lines of poetry

1376
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,193
that actually rhymed and it was like.

1377
00:59:59,154 --> 01:00:01,916
And the first two tries, it spit out absolute garbage.

1378
01:00:01,916 --> 01:00:04,197
But the third one was actually very sensible.

1379
01:00:04,197 --> 01:00:07,019
Like, it was like, oh, I could believe that a human wrote this.

1380
01:00:07,019 --> 01:00:11,523
So the scary part is OpenAI did not release the train model that they built for this because

1381
01:00:11,523 --> 01:00:16,707
the potential for this to be used to troll people on the internets with fake whatever...

1382
01:00:17,487 --> 01:00:23,075
propaganda bullshit is ginormous, but the potential for it to write interesting narrative

1383
01:00:23,075 --> 01:00:28,343
is also ginormous. And it's interesting because it all becomes about what is the creative part

1384
01:00:28,343 --> 01:00:32,709
about writing. Because if you look about writing in general, it's also very scientific. There is like

1385
01:00:32,989 --> 01:00:34,950
I have my structure, I have my story beats.

1386
01:00:34,950 --> 01:00:38,151
Something has to like, I need the inciting incident on page 10.

1387
01:00:38,151 --> 01:00:40,791
My darkest night at the end of chapter two has to be this.

1388
01:00:40,791 --> 01:00:45,953
And so like there are all of these very scientific things that exist around the writing process

1389
01:00:45,953 --> 01:00:50,374
and the question is exactly like with art, like what is the shape, the tone, the color,

1390
01:00:50,374 --> 01:00:52,335
the lighting, the subject that you're trying to communicate?

1391
01:00:52,715 --> 01:00:53,875
And that's where, yeah, absolutely agree.

1392
01:00:53,875 --> 01:00:56,136
In fact, we did a demo of Promethean for guys

1393
01:00:56,136 --> 01:00:59,277
at Chaos Group, the creators of V-Ray,

1394
01:00:59,277 --> 01:01:00,618
and they were actually talking about wanting

1395
01:01:00,618 --> 01:01:02,138
the same interface that Promethean has

1396
01:01:02,138 --> 01:01:04,239
for creative writing, because of the same process.

1397
01:01:04,239 --> 01:01:06,600
You go from the big shapes to the small shapes.

1398
01:01:06,600 --> 01:01:09,001
You define the overall theme, and then you go,

1399
01:01:09,001 --> 01:01:10,462
let's zero in on this, let's zero in a little smaller,

1400
01:01:10,462 --> 01:01:11,862
let's zero in a little smaller,

1401
01:01:11,862 --> 01:01:13,043
and I think that's gonna apply to everything.

1402
01:01:13,043 --> 01:01:15,303
That's basically how every human process is going to be,

1403
01:01:15,303 --> 01:01:17,064
which is, you're gonna have things you care about,

1404
01:01:17,064 --> 01:01:18,645
and you're gonna have things you don't care about.

1405
01:01:18,865 --> 01:01:22,189
And if you can have something else take care of everything you don't care about so that you can

1406
01:01:22,189 --> 01:01:25,953
specifically specify the things that are important to your story, to your narrative,

1407
01:01:25,953 --> 01:01:29,718
to your characterism, that that is what we're going to end up doing. Thank you. Thank you.

1408
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:33,323
Hey, thanks for the very cool talk.

1409
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:36,146
I might be on the pessimistic side.

1410
01:01:36,146 --> 01:01:41,331
One of your slides said the future is in art direction, and I really like that.

1411
01:01:41,331 --> 01:01:44,935
Say if in the future every one of us in this room becomes an art director, we make our

1412
01:01:44,935 --> 01:01:50,441
own game without worrying any of the production things, do you think AI could be a better

1413
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:53,123
art director than every single one of us combined?

1414
01:01:54,162 --> 01:02:00,306
That is a good question and I think something has been very interesting to us. And you know what. So I'm going to start

1415
01:02:00,306 --> 01:02:05,188
with a segue because I think it's important. There is a very optimistic future but it's a potential future something that I

1416
01:02:05,188 --> 01:02:09,571
don't want anyone to get sort of very blase about is the idea that someone can't come in and just go.

1417
01:02:10,111 --> 01:02:11,772
here's a tool, it's going to be crap,

1418
01:02:11,772 --> 01:02:13,533
but economically it's going to solve a problem

1419
01:02:13,533 --> 01:02:14,853
for you right now, and then we're all going

1420
01:02:14,853 --> 01:02:16,014
to be locked into this.

1421
01:02:16,014 --> 01:02:17,574
And so that's where I think it's very important

1422
01:02:17,574 --> 01:02:19,375
to actually, for everyone to be informed

1423
01:02:19,375 --> 01:02:20,636
and know that it's up to you to say,

1424
01:02:20,636 --> 01:02:22,557
you know what, this tool does not deserve me.

1425
01:02:22,557 --> 01:02:24,438
This is not good enough, let's figure this out.

1426
01:02:24,438 --> 01:02:25,998
And I know you can do better,

1427
01:02:25,998 --> 01:02:28,719
I don't take no for an answer, and then we'll do something.

1428
01:02:28,719 --> 01:02:29,880
But then just to go back to your point,

1429
01:02:29,880 --> 01:02:32,281
something that's very fascinating to us,

1430
01:02:32,281 --> 01:02:33,462
for example, building Promethean,

1431
01:02:33,462 --> 01:02:35,402
Promethean builds virtual spaces.

1432
01:02:35,402 --> 01:02:37,143
And it doesn't have,

1433
01:02:37,543 --> 01:02:38,804
it understands a lot of concepts,

1434
01:02:38,804 --> 01:02:40,266
it doesn't understand all of them.

1435
01:02:40,266 --> 01:02:41,987
And sometimes we'd see interesting combinations

1436
01:02:41,987 --> 01:02:43,988
of like it created a composition in a space

1437
01:02:43,988 --> 01:02:47,191
that a human looks at and starts projecting

1438
01:02:47,191 --> 01:02:48,492
sort of a story on.

1439
01:02:48,492 --> 01:02:50,093
It's like, oh, something happened here.

1440
01:02:50,093 --> 01:02:51,274
Like, oh, this vase on the floor.

1441
01:02:51,274 --> 01:02:52,695
Like, oh, somebody had a fight.

1442
01:02:52,695 --> 01:02:54,016
And it's entirely an accident,

1443
01:02:54,016 --> 01:02:56,077
but we as humans tend to project a lot of interesting

1444
01:02:56,077 --> 01:02:58,339
sort of internal reflections that we have.

1445
01:02:58,339 --> 01:02:59,720
It was a fascinating discovery,

1446
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:02,042
but that's where I think there are two types of experiences.

1447
01:03:02,042 --> 01:03:04,644
There are experiences that we will find for ourselves.

1448
01:03:04,944 --> 01:03:08,646
like with music. Sometimes musicians say that they want to write lyrics that resonate with everyone

1449
01:03:08,646 --> 01:03:13,068
and that's kind of fine because there will be experiences like yeah you can make a very generic

1450
01:03:13,068 --> 01:03:17,651
AI based experience that everyone will see a little bit of themselves in. You know a super

1451
01:03:17,651 --> 01:03:21,453
generic pop song when you describe the love interest like oh that literally sounds like

1452
01:03:21,453 --> 01:03:26,335
every single person you know she has two legs and two elbows or whatever like you've heard the.

1453
01:03:26,956 --> 01:03:30,740
radio, but it's kind of like that, like that part might work, but then the other part I

1454
01:03:30,740 --> 01:03:34,345
think that's very interesting, there are very directed experiences where, at least for me,

1455
01:03:34,345 --> 01:03:39,512
art is about making choices and sharing these choices, and there's, you know, for every

1456
01:03:39,512 --> 01:03:43,777
generically broad pop song, there's a Bob Dylan song that's like, this thing happened.

1457
01:03:43,917 --> 01:03:45,698
Like if you've never heard of it,

1458
01:03:45,698 --> 01:03:47,179
I'd highly recommend check out

1459
01:03:47,179 --> 01:03:49,341
The Lonesome Deaths of Hattie Carroll.

1460
01:03:49,341 --> 01:03:51,342
And it was recorded like 1964.

1461
01:03:51,342 --> 01:03:53,223
And it's literally about an incident

1462
01:03:53,223 --> 01:03:56,425
of basically a rich white man killing a woman

1463
01:03:56,425 --> 01:03:58,026
for no reason with a cane

1464
01:03:58,026 --> 01:04:00,228
because she was a woman of color and he was drunk.

1465
01:04:00,228 --> 01:04:02,369
And it was literally a song exactly about that

1466
01:04:02,369 --> 01:04:03,129
and nothing more.

1467
01:04:03,129 --> 01:04:04,731
And it has such profound impact

1468
01:04:04,731 --> 01:04:07,913
because it has so many layers of very deliberate intent

1469
01:04:07,913 --> 01:04:10,134
that it tries to impart onto you.

1470
01:04:10,134 --> 01:04:11,215
And I think that,

1471
01:04:11,255 --> 01:04:15,598
these experiences can coexist. It's fine if people want to see themselves in something very broad,

1472
01:04:15,598 --> 01:04:18,941
but also if somebody wants to tell you a very specific story, I think it's

1473
01:04:18,941 --> 01:04:23,384
going to have potentially a higher impact because it's tailored to you, which is very interesting.

1474
01:04:23,384 --> 01:04:27,067
So right now we have to make video games that everybody has to like because we need to sell

1475
01:04:27,067 --> 01:04:30,810
them to everybody. If we don't need to sell them to everybody and we just need to sell them to like

1476
01:04:30,810 --> 01:04:34,532
20 people, we can make something that these 20 people will not just like, but they will

1477
01:04:34,532 --> 01:04:35,953
absolutely freaking love it.

1478
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:37,414
And I think that's where the value is.

1479
01:04:37,414 --> 01:04:39,255
And I don't think AI will able to do that.

1480
01:04:39,255 --> 01:04:41,075
It's good at generalizing rather than making something

1481
01:04:41,075 --> 01:04:42,376
extremely particular.

1482
01:04:42,376 --> 01:04:44,136
Hopefully that answers that.

1483
01:04:44,136 --> 01:04:44,296
Hey.

1484
01:04:44,296 --> 01:04:46,357
Just a quick follow up question to that.

1485
01:04:46,357 --> 01:04:55,040
So if we proceed down that kind of line of thinking

1486
01:04:55,040 --> 01:04:57,041
and AI ends up generating a lot more of the generic

1487
01:04:57,041 --> 01:04:59,701
kind of typical movie kind of.

1488
01:05:00,529 --> 01:05:02,931
kind of, uh, just generic stuff.

1489
01:05:02,931 --> 01:05:03,031
Uh-huh.

1490
01:05:03,031 --> 01:05:07,675
Um, do you think that could end up in a situation a bit like, kind of,

1491
01:05:07,675 --> 01:05:10,217
was typecast with a Steam Greenlight situation of...

1492
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:16,433
the good gem games and whatnot being developed by kind of creative people being lost in the rough

1493
01:05:16,433 --> 01:05:20,935
of like thousands and thousands of AI generated kind of not so great games. That is a very good

1494
01:05:20,935 --> 01:05:24,837
problem it actually gets brought up a lot also yeah like how much more content can we want to

1495
01:05:24,837 --> 01:05:28,859
have because there's already so much that nobody has the time to consume it which makes sense. I

1496
01:05:28,859 --> 01:05:33,001
think there's part of this like cultural phenomena that we all want to make sure we consume the same

1497
01:05:33,001 --> 01:05:34,902
content so we can talk with our friends about it.

1498
01:05:35,182 --> 01:05:38,785
which is interesting, but that kind of limits the ability to cater content to people.

1499
01:05:38,785 --> 01:05:40,507
But something that's very ironic about this problem,

1500
01:05:40,507 --> 01:05:45,431
it literally Netflix is pouring like bajillions of money to cater the content to you and go,

1501
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:49,695
oh, you like this character in this movie, let us literally cut out the screenshot from the movie

1502
01:05:49,695 --> 01:05:52,777
and show you a thumbnail with this guy who's in this movie for three seconds.

1503
01:05:52,777 --> 01:05:55,059
But we're going to show it to you. So you click on it and watch it.

1504
01:05:55,059 --> 01:05:57,341
And basically, I think what's going to happen is the more content appears,

1505
01:05:57,341 --> 01:06:01,465
the better the technology becomes that actually finds the right content for you.

1506
01:06:01,465 --> 01:06:03,586
And so it's going to be like an arm race of sorts.

1507
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:08,329
But I think it's also a good problem to have where we have more good things rather than less good things.

1508
01:06:08,329 --> 01:06:11,150
Sure. From a financial aspect of that then,

1509
01:06:11,150 --> 01:06:15,572
if there is so much content and everyone gets their own personalized kind of...

1510
01:06:15,572 --> 01:06:16,313
Experience.

1511
01:06:16,313 --> 01:06:18,854
...library of games that they want to play,

1512
01:06:18,854 --> 01:06:22,736
does that not mean that each individual one would technically get less sales and whatnot

1513
01:06:22,736 --> 01:06:25,597
because they're being tailored to individual people

1514
01:06:25,597 --> 01:06:28,558
and it's not getting the broader audience and therefore the financial investment?

1515
01:06:29,068 --> 01:06:30,929
Potentially, if you look at a lot of indie games, right,

1516
01:06:30,929 --> 01:06:34,130
like you can, depends on how your budget is structured,

1517
01:06:34,130 --> 01:06:36,211
the development, but you can sell whatever,

1518
01:06:36,211 --> 01:06:37,451
like 100,000 copies and actually make

1519
01:06:37,451 --> 01:06:38,891
a decent amount of money, which is,

1520
01:06:38,891 --> 01:06:40,612
in, you know, grander scheme of things,

1521
01:06:40,612 --> 01:06:42,112
is not that many people.

1522
01:06:42,112 --> 01:06:44,853
But also the other thing I think that's interesting is,

1523
01:06:44,853 --> 01:06:47,034
you can create content that can, in marginal ways,

1524
01:06:47,034 --> 01:06:48,314
cater itself to different people,

1525
01:06:48,314 --> 01:06:49,835
where you can have the one broad experience,

1526
01:06:49,835 --> 01:06:51,775
but then it's like, oh, whatever, like in my game,

1527
01:06:51,775 --> 01:06:53,856
this guy's going to be a little bit more of an asshole,

1528
01:06:53,856 --> 01:06:55,336
because I happen to like it.

1529
01:06:55,336 --> 01:06:57,157
That sounds horrible, but you know what I mean.

1530
01:06:57,157 --> 01:06:58,597
The experience adapts.

1531
01:06:58,917 --> 01:07:00,839
to you to a point where it's still the same experience.

1532
01:07:00,839 --> 01:07:02,940
You can still monetize it sort of more broadly,

1533
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:06,543
but you actually sort of in that D&D game master for you

1534
01:07:06,543 --> 01:07:08,285
that everyone shares an experience,

1535
01:07:08,285 --> 01:07:09,946
but it's a little different.

1536
01:07:09,946 --> 01:07:13,589
Not unlike the interactive Netflix Black Mirror episodes

1537
01:07:13,589 --> 01:07:15,330
that basically had choices for different people

1538
01:07:15,330 --> 01:07:16,511
so that they could express themselves.

1539
01:07:16,511 --> 01:07:16,611
Great.

1540
01:07:16,611 --> 01:07:17,852
Hopefully that works.

1541
01:07:17,852 --> 01:07:19,513
Thanks for talking, really fascinating.

1542
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:20,434
Oh, well I appreciate it, thank you.

1543
01:07:21,563 --> 01:07:43,418
Andrew, thank you. Super interesting stuff. I have a question. Do you see like a kind of recursive learning like you know as you're training AI and then AI is training from you and you essentially start repeating the same patterns and as you train from AI and AI trains from you, what do you see happening? Do you see like cats within cats kind of stuff?

1544
01:07:43,791 --> 01:07:46,892
Oh, it's interesting.

1545
01:07:46,892 --> 01:07:51,134
I think there's a certain realization that is occurring right now where a lot of data

1546
01:07:51,134 --> 01:07:52,195
is kind of pointless.

1547
01:07:52,195 --> 01:07:56,537
Like self-driving cars is a good example, where we have millions of hours of recording

1548
01:07:56,537 --> 01:07:58,038
of just driving down the road.

1549
01:07:58,578 --> 01:08:00,499
And it will work fine, and so that sort of,

1550
01:08:00,499 --> 01:08:02,560
you have like a bell curve distribution, right?

1551
01:08:02,560 --> 01:08:04,981
Like that middle section, it's kind of taken care of

1552
01:08:04,981 --> 01:08:07,082
with like 10,000 hours, you don't need a million hours.

1553
01:08:07,082 --> 01:08:08,603
And so at that point, you can kind of stop.

1554
01:08:08,603 --> 01:08:10,224
The problem is what's called the long tail.

1555
01:08:10,224 --> 01:08:12,505
It's like all of these cases at the edge of your bell curve

1556
01:08:12,505 --> 01:08:14,326
where we're like, oh, there was a cat

1557
01:08:14,326 --> 01:08:15,966
that was wearing like a traffic cone

1558
01:08:15,966 --> 01:08:17,607
on its head running across the street.

1559
01:08:17,607 --> 01:08:19,868
Like what the hell does your car do at that point?

1560
01:08:19,868 --> 01:08:22,710
And like all of these is where you actually need your data.

1561
01:08:22,710 --> 01:08:25,451
Like that's where like people sitting at Tesla in Unreal

1562
01:08:25,451 --> 01:08:27,292
are making cats with traffic cones on their heads.

1563
01:08:27,292 --> 01:08:27,412
But.

1564
01:08:28,353 --> 01:08:30,914
So not necessarily that, but I guess the idea is that

1565
01:08:30,914 --> 01:08:33,615
the point is not to just feed it as much data as possible

1566
01:08:33,615 --> 01:08:36,876
because there's different types of quality to data.

1567
01:08:36,876 --> 01:08:39,217
And you want to make sure that the data you're feeding it

1568
01:08:39,217 --> 01:08:42,319
is actually valuable in terms of giving it new skills

1569
01:08:42,319 --> 01:08:42,859
or new features.

1570
01:08:42,859 --> 01:08:44,960
Like something we're aware at Promethean, for example,

1571
01:08:44,960 --> 01:08:47,261
when we build a new type of environment,

1572
01:08:47,261 --> 01:08:49,862
we sit down and we break it down, what is valuable?

1573
01:08:49,862 --> 01:08:51,303
Like how would I want to art direct it?

1574
01:08:51,303 --> 01:08:52,883
What are the adjectives that apply to it?

1575
01:08:52,883 --> 01:08:54,744
And then we kind of build towards that.

1576
01:08:54,744 --> 01:08:56,605
It's not that let's just throw everything we know

1577
01:08:56,605 --> 01:08:57,385
about the space.

1578
01:08:57,706 --> 01:08:59,047
How would this look if this was messy?

1579
01:08:59,047 --> 01:09:02,271
How would this look if this was destroyed, dilapidated,

1580
01:09:02,271 --> 01:09:05,115
new, old, and just applying all of these concepts?

1581
01:09:05,115 --> 01:09:06,837
And that's where I think at some point

1582
01:09:06,837 --> 01:09:09,039
you just stop training just for the sake of training

1583
01:09:09,039 --> 01:09:10,781
and you actually look for the quality of the content.

1584
01:09:10,781 --> 01:09:11,602
Hopefully that answers that.

1585
01:09:11,602 --> 01:09:12,243
All right, thank you guys.

1586
01:09:12,243 --> 01:09:14,967
You made it through Tuesday.

1587
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,510
Come on, round of applause for you.
