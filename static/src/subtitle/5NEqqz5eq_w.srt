00:00:06,227 --> 00:00:14,009
Hello everybody, my name is Nino Sapina.

2
00:00:14,189 --> 00:00:16,430
I am a CEO and co-founder of Reelcast.

3
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:23,291
Our company develops immersive experience in extended reality using different kind of

4
00:00:23,311 --> 00:00:28,053
technologies with virtual reality, mixed reality or method reality.

5
00:00:29,349 --> 00:00:34,794
In the last four years, we have developed many different experiences for cultural locations

6
00:00:35,875 --> 00:00:39,338
to present to the visitors of the Museum of Heritage Locations.

7
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,824
My company was created four years ago with my co-founder Diego Fernandez Bravo.

8
00:00:46,625 --> 00:00:49,047
He's a technical director and I am a producer.

9
00:00:49,367 --> 00:00:53,011
We worked together for more than 15 years in the video games industry.

10
00:00:53,811 --> 00:01:00,155
Notably, we developed at Ubisoft very famous games like Just Dance and The Raving Rabbits.

11
00:01:00,916 --> 00:01:08,521
So very mainstream games using motion gaming with the controllers, with the Kinect cameras.

12
00:01:08,681 --> 00:01:15,886
So we were always interested to see how interactive innovation can bring new kind

13
00:01:15,906 --> 00:01:21,750
of experience to the gamers or to the visitors. When we built this company, we wanted to see

14
00:01:22,667 --> 00:01:28,090
how this new immersive technology works with the general public. The public who is not technical,

15
00:01:28,230 --> 00:01:35,273
who doesn't know how headsets work, and who doesn't know even how the games work.

16
00:01:36,373 --> 00:01:43,357
Because in museums obviously you have people from all the ages, all the technical and non-technical

17
00:01:43,417 --> 00:01:50,200
knowledge. Some people are even don't like technical devices. So we wanted to test this

18
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,380
technology with this kind of project.

19
00:01:55,651 --> 00:02:00,832
building right now. So I will show you the experience that calls Insurrection 1944

20
00:02:01,052 --> 00:02:10,374
that speaks about the Second World War and the end of the war in Paris. Let me

21
00:02:10,414 --> 00:02:15,255
present you the location. So this is a view of Museum of the Liberation of

22
00:02:15,335 --> 00:02:20,276
Paris. It's built on the place D'enfer-Rochereau.

23
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:24,861
which is a famous place for people who already visited Paris.

24
00:02:24,941 --> 00:02:26,902
They probably visited catacombs.

25
00:02:27,622 --> 00:02:31,064
The catacombs are just across the boulevard, on the other side of the boulevard.

26
00:02:32,105 --> 00:02:37,187
And the particular thing about this museum is that it's built upon a very historical location,

27
00:02:37,928 --> 00:02:42,310
which is the underground shelter that was built between two wars

28
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:46,972
for the population of Paris in case of a chemical attack.

29
00:02:47,613 --> 00:02:50,054
That never happened, but this place was built.

30
00:02:51,603 --> 00:02:57,246
for that time and then the resistance during the Second World War have identified this place as an

31
00:02:57,946 --> 00:03:07,351
ideal place to go there and to act, organize the resurrection and the resistance in Paris region.

32
00:03:11,133 --> 00:03:15,375
On this slide you can see the stairs that are leading to this place,

33
00:03:15,555 --> 00:03:18,336
which is quite deep underground, there are 200 steps.

34
00:03:19,398 --> 00:03:22,118
It's a long descent to the location.

35
00:03:23,139 --> 00:03:28,000
And in the second photo, you can see corridors.

36
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:30,260
There, they are completely empty,

37
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,221
which means that for the museum direction,

38
00:03:35,461 --> 00:03:40,082
they really had a hard time to find a solution

39
00:03:40,662 --> 00:03:43,643
how to present what happened in this location

40
00:03:44,323 --> 00:03:47,884
without any physical artifacts or things to show inside.

41
00:03:47,924 --> 00:03:48,724
They are small.

42
00:03:49,550 --> 00:03:58,055
small armories, you can see some elements but very few because most of the things were taken away.

43
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:06,259
So all corridors are different, the same sorry, and the rooms as well. So the solution of

44
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:14,824
virtual and mixed reality was really ideal to populate this place, to give the life to this

45
00:04:14,904 --> 00:04:18,186
place so the visitors can be like...

46
00:04:19,041 --> 00:04:28,844
in the time of 1944 and to meet the resistance and the people who was working there for two weeks at the end of the war.

47
00:04:29,945 --> 00:04:37,727
So I will show you the video without sound that I will comment that shows the museum and the experience itself.

48
00:04:38,947 --> 00:04:43,809
Please note that the video cannot transcript the real immersive experience.

49
00:04:44,549 --> 00:04:47,470
So you can only see these 2D images but.

50
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:55,827
The only and the best way to realize is to go there and to have experience. So I warmly invite

51
00:04:55,847 --> 00:05:04,093
you to come to Paris when you can. This exhibit is permanent, so it will be there anytime and

52
00:05:04,373 --> 00:05:16,283
so you can have a real experience. So this is the museum and the Don Perrot show place and we have

53
00:05:16,323 --> 00:05:16,943
been using.

54
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:25,974
archive video that was filmed at the end of the war, where they filmed the resistance still

55
00:05:26,575 --> 00:05:33,038
in this location. And this helped us to reconstruct the characters, the objects,

56
00:05:33,778 --> 00:05:38,820
and the different activities that happened in this location. It was, for example,

57
00:05:40,181 --> 00:05:41,341
Central, Telephone Central.

58
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:50,386
and of course different characters like this soldier who is your guide and Colin Rourke who

59
00:05:50,426 --> 00:05:57,291
was the leader who was the chief of the resistance, a very famous historical character and thanks to

60
00:05:57,311 --> 00:06:05,498
this experience you will be able to meet him. You can see here the picture, the photo of Colin Rourke

61
00:06:06,139 --> 00:06:08,261
that was taken the same location as

62
00:06:09,636 --> 00:06:15,157
As we were building the experience, we have recreated the colonel role in three dimensions

63
00:06:15,557 --> 00:06:22,298
using the human actors. And we did the same scene, the phone scene, where he was phoning

64
00:06:22,838 --> 00:06:30,780
to the network of resistance to find, to resolve some very urgent situation during

65
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:36,301
the liberation of Paris. The particularity of this place is that it's 100% humidity.

66
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:47,123
So very particular and difficult constraints for technical materials, so it means that we should

67
00:06:47,163 --> 00:06:58,890
not leave any headsets or other devices in this place for a long time. Obviously the depth and

68
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:03,753
difficulty to access, there was no Wi-Fi at all, that was also the constraint from the museum,

69
00:07:03,953 --> 00:07:04,994
so we had to build.

70
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:14,398
the system for HoloLens that uses spatial anchoring but only locally embarked in the headset

71
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:21,124
with no possibility to have a communication between the headset and remote

72
00:07:22,566 --> 00:07:26,790
calculations for example that could help in a spatial anchoring.

73
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:33,981
And as I said, we had very few elements, mostly photos,

74
00:07:34,141 --> 00:07:37,864
and this only movie that was captured at the end of the war.

75
00:07:39,406 --> 00:07:41,247
So the choice of the technology of Collins

76
00:07:41,267 --> 00:07:45,531
was really, I would say, the one or few that

77
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:52,277
fit the needs of the museum and their will

78
00:07:52,477 --> 00:07:54,058
to show what happened in this place

79
00:07:54,499 --> 00:07:57,501
without any physical objects.

80
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:07,002
So we won this, it was public appeal to win the project and then we it was a very big rush

81
00:08:07,662 --> 00:08:13,903
because we had only seven months to build the whole experience which is quite short regarding

82
00:08:13,963 --> 00:08:22,284
the all the creative elements that have to be built and also technical hurdles that should

83
00:08:22,324 --> 00:08:27,805
be resolved in this short period of time. It's a little bit about the

84
00:08:28,882 --> 00:08:37,608
about how it works. So here you can see the notebook of the visitor, because visitors play

85
00:08:37,688 --> 00:08:44,633
the role of the journalist in the time of Second World War, and his role was to interview all the

86
00:08:44,673 --> 00:08:50,517
resistance and to understand what is going on during the war and during their action,

87
00:08:50,637 --> 00:08:52,398
and to make article for the press.

88
00:08:53,921 --> 00:08:59,504
for the Parisian population to know how to insurrect and how to liberate from the occupants,

89
00:09:00,125 --> 00:09:06,349
from the Nazis, before the Allied troops arrived, because Allied troops were arriving in two weeks

90
00:09:07,029 --> 00:09:11,752
and the Resistance was there to make a communication between the

91
00:09:12,412 --> 00:09:17,896
Resistance in Paris, in the Paris suburbs, and obviously with the Allied troops that were arriving.

92
00:09:21,681 --> 00:09:29,643
So here you can see the initial works inside of the museum before the installation. Here's the

93
00:09:29,683 --> 00:09:37,244
director of the museum showing us the plans. This is a big door, the entrance of this place,

94
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:44,246
and this is the famous indication where is the office of the Colonel Raul that dates from this

95
00:09:44,526 --> 00:09:49,227
moment and that is part of all the elements of the storytelling.

96
00:09:50,666 --> 00:09:55,108
The challenge was how to make a life in this place without any objects.

97
00:09:56,369 --> 00:10:03,994
So, as I said, we built a whole set of characters and the objects and the storyline to lead

98
00:10:04,315 --> 00:10:12,180
you through this space in a very natural way without need to any human assistance.

99
00:10:13,340 --> 00:10:15,402
So it's visual, it's audio.

100
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:16,863
Audio is very important.

101
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:28,906
And we succeeded to build this experience to lead the visitors in a very simple manner,

102
00:10:29,586 --> 00:10:32,588
but behind that was a very complex technical solution.

103
00:10:33,448 --> 00:10:39,310
So this is the plan of the location. So you can see there are multiple corridors and multiple

104
00:10:39,370 --> 00:10:45,352
rooms with different activities. So was like entrance. So entrance was the first

105
00:10:46,764 --> 00:10:50,587
I would say contact with the mixed reality for the visitors.

106
00:10:51,328 --> 00:10:58,754
So they just got the headset on the head and then they see the door that opens.

107
00:10:58,995 --> 00:11:03,799
So they have to press the ring button with their finger because it works with the hand tracking.

108
00:11:04,419 --> 00:11:10,765
And then the doors open and then they see the virtual character inviting them to the experience.

109
00:11:11,447 --> 00:11:15,189
and then the character leads them to different rooms.

110
00:11:15,810 --> 00:11:18,712
So one of the things that was very important is that

111
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:23,656
this place is quite, I would say, the corridors are not very large,

112
00:11:23,776 --> 00:11:26,998
so we wanted that the visitors can go in different rooms,

113
00:11:27,078 --> 00:11:28,799
but not all together at the same time.

114
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,282
So we built several paths through this location.

115
00:11:33,683 --> 00:11:36,305
So every time when another visitor...

116
00:11:38,432 --> 00:11:41,893
it would take another path and do the experience in different ways.

117
00:11:42,433 --> 00:11:48,175
So that was the solution to use the place, the whole place, as much as possible

118
00:11:48,635 --> 00:11:52,876
without having people walking in the same direction at the same time.

119
00:11:53,377 --> 00:11:56,597
So the best comfort and the best quality of the experience.

120
00:11:58,758 --> 00:12:04,280
We were using for this the mechanics of video games that we worked for many years.

121
00:12:04,977 --> 00:12:10,581
which means that everything is interactive. Each room you can meet a character that speaks to you,

122
00:12:11,181 --> 00:12:16,825
that asks you to do some very simple gesture. It's not a video game, it should be more accessible

123
00:12:16,865 --> 00:12:24,651
because the experience is shorter than the game, but still it was very important for the immersive

124
00:12:24,771 --> 00:12:30,274
part that visitor can do things in each of the room and feel like they were part of the story.

125
00:12:30,815 --> 00:12:34,037
So for example here in the room of

126
00:12:35,275 --> 00:12:40,039
Cartier Général in headquarters, they were like building a

127
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:46,063
barricade in a reduced model. In the phone central, they were

128
00:12:46,124 --> 00:12:53,349
reading the articles to the operator. In the secretary room,

129
00:12:53,889 --> 00:12:57,652
they were finding the movement of the troops to be shown on the

130
00:12:57,712 --> 00:13:03,236
map that was on the wall. And in the colonel role room, they were

131
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:03,677
giving

132
00:13:05,126 --> 00:13:11,210
a pen to the corral so he can show them what's going on there and after they were following the

133
00:13:11,471 --> 00:13:18,416
soldier through the experience. So here you can see the, I would say without a wall,

134
00:13:18,696 --> 00:13:25,381
the whole different characters and the settings. So it's in fact it's a quite huge scene

135
00:13:26,442 --> 00:13:30,565
but obviously separated in smaller chunks of each experience.

136
00:13:31,667 --> 00:13:37,529
So you can have seven characters that are in this experience that are getting activated

137
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:41,731
when you come close to them and they talk to you.

138
00:13:45,552 --> 00:13:49,513
The character approach is very much related to the

139
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:54,516
I would say the movie storytelling because they're alive, they're looking at you at the eyes,

140
00:13:55,856 --> 00:14:03,460
and they are really following what you are doing. And if you, for example, you get lost or you wait

141
00:14:03,520 --> 00:14:07,823
in the corridor, but they will stop. They will wait for you. They will ask you, do you want to

142
00:14:07,863 --> 00:14:12,965
continue? If you do something wrong, for example, you don't understand what you have to do, they

143
00:14:13,205 --> 00:14:17,608
will try to help you. And then at some point, they will just lead you to the next step.

144
00:14:18,293 --> 00:14:25,056
So it's really intelligent and adaptive interaction towards the visitors so they

145
00:14:25,476 --> 00:14:30,818
they feel like they're really handled by the real humans even if it's only virtual characters.

146
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:45,905
Here you can see the excerpt of the movie and also the archives. So we use the scan

147
00:14:46,662 --> 00:14:54,086
of the journals from the time and perform them in 3D models and then make them interactive so

148
00:14:54,466 --> 00:14:59,669
visitors would choose the article that the secretary will read and then make an action

149
00:14:59,709 --> 00:15:06,994
to show what's going on in the field and to show them where are the troops coming.

150
00:15:09,535 --> 00:15:14,818
We built the scenario with the specialists and experts from the history that was

151
00:15:16,364 --> 00:15:17,645
provided by the museum.

152
00:15:18,565 --> 00:15:20,846
And so we did a lot of work for the research

153
00:15:21,547 --> 00:15:24,648
to be really very accurate in terms of history

154
00:15:24,809 --> 00:15:29,731
and to choose the most crucial part of the history

155
00:15:30,232 --> 00:15:31,872
and in the same time to make a choice,

156
00:15:32,793 --> 00:15:36,875
not to do too much because the experience is 25 minutes,

157
00:15:36,935 --> 00:15:39,276
which is quite long for this kind of experience, but still.

158
00:15:40,476 --> 00:15:49,559
At the end, time goes by very quickly, and it's important for the visitor to remember the key elements of the history.

159
00:15:50,099 --> 00:16:02,684
And then after, he can go upstairs in the museum and go much more in-depth about each of the elements and find information about every moment of the liberation of Paris.

160
00:16:05,745 --> 00:16:06,745
Here we can see the...

161
00:16:09,222 --> 00:16:16,886
the equipment and the habits of the soldiers that we used to scan in three dimensions.

162
00:16:17,586 --> 00:16:26,010
So our approach was really to use the actors, the real actors, that we did like a casting and we

163
00:16:26,050 --> 00:16:33,234
choose the actors that were the closest to the looks of some historical character, for example

164
00:16:33,334 --> 00:16:33,574
role.

165
00:16:34,933 --> 00:16:44,114
And also we work with all the, I would say, creative crew from the movies, like costumes, like

166
00:16:45,075 --> 00:16:56,617
mannequins, for the lookalike of the face to make them as real as possible before to do the scan.

167
00:16:59,777 --> 00:17:03,118
This is the session of capture of photogrammetry.

168
00:17:04,453 --> 00:17:10,835
So each actor went to this session and was captured multiple times to have the best quality model

169
00:17:11,655 --> 00:17:19,497
of his body with the habits of the time. And so there was a scan of the body and there was

170
00:17:19,557 --> 00:17:28,659
more detailed scan of the face. You can see our developer working on the integration of different

171
00:17:28,939 --> 00:17:33,340
assets, 3D assets, animations.

172
00:17:34,514 --> 00:17:40,439
elipsing dialogues into the same character that became alive.

173
00:17:41,940 --> 00:17:45,943
And this is also very close to the video game industry where

174
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:54,690
you build the characters, they have a full set of motion, capacity to walk, to talk,

175
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:58,473
to interrupt their movements regarding what you are doing.

176
00:18:03,052 --> 00:18:09,654
Here you will see the session of motion capture, which is also a way to, after the 3D scan,

177
00:18:09,975 --> 00:18:15,276
we did motion capture to capture all the movement that have been decided to be used in this

178
00:18:15,316 --> 00:18:15,837
experience.

179
00:18:17,097 --> 00:18:26,100
And this is a soldier, Roch, he's opened the first door and inviting the visitors to come

180
00:18:26,200 --> 00:18:27,541
and to enter the experience.

181
00:18:35,425 --> 00:18:39,086
So we spent several days to capture all these movements.

182
00:18:39,126 --> 00:18:43,588
You can see the sound studio with a recording of voices.

183
00:18:44,748 --> 00:18:47,649
The funny thing is that the main character,

184
00:18:47,669 --> 00:18:51,431
Colonel Rolk, who is obviously French,

185
00:18:53,511 --> 00:18:55,732
and when we decided to make an English version

186
00:18:55,832 --> 00:19:00,434
of the experience, we decided to keep him speaking English

187
00:19:00,594 --> 00:19:03,935
with his very strong French accent.

188
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:06,012
And it was a really great choice.

189
00:19:06,172 --> 00:19:09,495
And all the visitors from England for the United States,

190
00:19:09,595 --> 00:19:14,199
they find that very normal and have no problem understanding

191
00:19:14,359 --> 00:19:16,501
and make this experience even more,

192
00:19:17,482 --> 00:19:20,545
I would say, immersive and lifelike.

193
00:19:22,307 --> 00:19:26,591
The last image is about facial capture,

194
00:19:27,331 --> 00:19:30,134
where we captured all the expressions of each.

195
00:19:31,987 --> 00:19:41,309
actor and after recreated facial expression that was added to the model and then enable each actor

196
00:19:41,389 --> 00:19:51,132
to talk different languages with very accurate lip syncs. So there are two languages available,

197
00:19:51,212 --> 00:19:56,293
French and English. Here is the manual to use.

198
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:04,132
The important part of the experience is also to have a person who is taking care about

199
00:20:04,712 --> 00:20:10,357
how the experience is managed outside of the experience.

200
00:20:10,437 --> 00:20:15,120
Means receiving the visitors, explaining what they will do, not in terms of content,

201
00:20:15,140 --> 00:20:21,345
but in terms of just handling and start and the end of the experience.

202
00:20:22,025 --> 00:20:25,268
The idea is that the visitor doesn't have to touch headset at all.

203
00:20:26,182 --> 00:20:33,448
Everything is installed by this mediator and he is taking the headset at the end of the experience

204
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:40,433
and the people should just forget about technology and go through the experience themselves

205
00:20:42,675 --> 00:20:48,080
and they'll go completely immersed into the experience. So these are the indications.

206
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:52,904
So this is for HoloLens 1 because we started with HoloLens 1 in August 2019.

207
00:20:55,814 --> 00:21:00,316
So the first version was HoloLens 1, so there was all instructions how to handle charging,

208
00:21:01,036 --> 00:21:07,980
installation, and different adjustments for the mediators, not for the users.

209
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:13,783
We did a lot of play tests before deployment, which means that we passed at least one month's

210
00:21:14,403 --> 00:21:20,826
testing with different personnel of the museum to find the best adjustments for the experience.

211
00:21:22,811 --> 00:21:30,537
And then even after the deployment, we use one month more to see how the experience was working with the users.

212
00:21:31,337 --> 00:21:45,468
And thanks to the mediator who was there watching the experience, get the feedbacks and improve the experience during the integration of this last month.

213
00:21:46,929 --> 00:21:47,930
And that was very important.

214
00:21:48,670 --> 00:21:51,911
The Microsoft was also a great partner because they were present.

215
00:21:51,951 --> 00:21:58,532
They even sent some people from the Redmond R&D to help us with the spatial anchoring,

216
00:21:58,552 --> 00:22:00,893
which was a very big challenge for this project.

217
00:22:02,513 --> 00:22:06,954
We didn't have any loss of material, any breaks.

218
00:22:07,355 --> 00:22:11,616
So this is really thanks to this system of a mediator who is taking care,

219
00:22:11,836 --> 00:22:17,557
completely care about the headsets and not leaving the user to manipulate.

220
00:22:18,594 --> 00:22:19,495
because it's not needed.

221
00:22:20,876 --> 00:22:22,858
And as you will see at the end,

222
00:22:22,958 --> 00:22:26,342
the returns of the public are really very, very positive.

223
00:22:27,584 --> 00:22:33,530
And that was really a big plus for this kind of experience

224
00:22:33,610 --> 00:22:37,835
where normally one part of the visitors are reluctant

225
00:22:38,516 --> 00:22:40,218
to this kind of technical solution.

226
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:50,001
So this is a Hollens 2 and six months after the installation of the experience,

227
00:22:50,521 --> 00:22:56,723
we were one of the first companies and teams to deploy a Hollens 2 experience.

228
00:22:59,804 --> 00:23:03,665
This museum was also the first client to have the Hollens 2.

229
00:23:06,379 --> 00:23:13,403
So it was a very big project and exciting for us to get hands on this new device.

230
00:23:14,244 --> 00:23:16,545
Since then, we have more than 10,000 visitors.

231
00:23:17,165 --> 00:23:25,591
Even though COVID removed a big part, still this experience is permanent and it's bringing the visitors every day.

232
00:23:27,352 --> 00:23:31,815
Obviously, this kind of experience brings young audience to the museums, which is the purpose.

233
00:23:32,545 --> 00:23:36,586
But it works very well with also people for any age.

234
00:23:37,386 --> 00:23:44,568
And this was also a big discovery for us to see that even the people for plus 60 to 70

235
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:51,450
can do the experience and appreciate the new technologies and to see and participate in this

236
00:23:51,470 --> 00:23:58,952
kind of experience. So the team was really very much involved and did huge efforts to make this

237
00:23:58,992 --> 00:23:59,232
happen.

238
00:24:01,005 --> 00:24:06,668
And fortunately we get a lot of feedback from the press, from the media after the release.

239
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,791
So we had a huge coverage coming even from the United States.

240
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:18,770
We collaborated with Microsoft, and they've sent some journalists, some influencers to make

241
00:24:19,110 --> 00:24:25,032
different articles. It was really this experience still today, it's a reference, I would say,

242
00:24:25,052 --> 00:24:31,255
in use of mixed reality in cultural locations. Finally, we won two awards,

243
00:24:31,395 --> 00:24:36,277
SATIS 360. It was an award given by the movie makers.

244
00:24:37,214 --> 00:24:43,156
famous movie makers, like the movie maker from Taxi, which was a very famous movie in France,

245
00:24:44,157 --> 00:24:48,178
because they discovered this kind of storytelling that they didn't know.

246
00:24:48,198 --> 00:24:56,262
And we also won the ORIA award in Germany, which is a very famous award since two years now,

247
00:24:56,502 --> 00:25:01,844
and we was like a winner in 2020. In fact, the award is 2019, but it happened in January 2020.

248
00:25:07,457 --> 00:25:13,059
And obviously, we are very happy to participate to GDC with one year of delay, but still,

249
00:25:13,519 --> 00:25:18,720
we believe that's a great opportunity to share this experience with you.

250
00:25:21,301 --> 00:25:27,563
So, a little bit more about visitors' feedbacks. So, as we said, the museum and us, we really

251
00:25:29,186 --> 00:25:34,547
taking account, we try to take into account a lot about the opinions of the visitors,

252
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:39,248
especially the first visitors, and to see how they are using the experience,

253
00:25:39,388 --> 00:25:45,890
what are the hurdles, maybe obstacles, what makes them, what makes the experience maybe

254
00:25:46,030 --> 00:25:50,591
people who don't want to finish or who don't like the technical solution.

255
00:25:51,351 --> 00:25:57,353
But frankly, we were very surprised, but very, very positive feedback.

256
00:25:58,389 --> 00:26:00,550
from all over the museum.

257
00:26:00,570 --> 00:26:03,952
So I can show you some sentences.

258
00:26:03,993 --> 00:26:10,397
There is like a book of remarks from the visitors

259
00:26:10,657 --> 00:26:13,339
and the museum, Paris Museum,

260
00:26:13,379 --> 00:26:15,961
who is handling 40 museums in Paris.

261
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:18,422
So they have really a lot of different museums

262
00:26:18,522 --> 00:26:21,644
and have different kind of digital solution

263
00:26:21,724 --> 00:26:24,086
for these museums.

264
00:26:24,166 --> 00:26:26,368
They say that this is the first one

265
00:26:27,140 --> 00:26:31,165
There's such a big positive feedback from the audience.

266
00:26:31,305 --> 00:26:32,486
It's almost unanimous.

267
00:26:33,868 --> 00:26:38,573
So people are really very, very happy and very impressed

268
00:26:38,673 --> 00:26:41,837
about what's possible with this kind of experience.

269
00:26:42,778 --> 00:26:43,179
So we...

270
00:26:45,814 --> 00:26:52,677
Yeah, we are happy to and we believe that there is a big future for this kind of experience

271
00:26:53,577 --> 00:26:58,939
in a different location. We also now, especially with the COVID, are also proposing

272
00:26:58,959 --> 00:27:05,942
to the location to build in-situ experience but also virtual experience that use the same assets

273
00:27:06,522 --> 00:27:13,405
so that can enable people who are at distance to participate to this experience together.

274
00:27:15,907 --> 00:27:22,488
So I let you leave these words and then I will finish my presentation on this slide.

275
00:27:23,329 --> 00:27:31,631
And please feel free to ask any question you have after the session. Thank you.
