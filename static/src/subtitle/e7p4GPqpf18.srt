00:00:06,314 --> 00:00:10,436
Welcome to my GDC talk, Ghost in the Machine,

2
00:00:10,456 --> 00:00:13,257
Autorial Voice in System Design.

3
00:00:13,277 --> 00:00:17,719
And I hope you are well in those bizarre times.

4
00:00:18,079 --> 00:00:21,981
And yes, the microphone is duct taped to my face.

5
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:25,962
So let's go with the topic at hand

6
00:00:26,402 --> 00:00:28,243
and let's start with the basics.

7
00:00:29,356 --> 00:00:43,221
Who am I? My name is Marza Fiak. Currently I'm a creative director at Anshar Studios, but for the past five years I worked at 11bit studios as a game designer, senior game designer, lead game designer and

8
00:00:43,844 --> 00:00:59,486
different things, working among others on Frostpunk. I did the society part of Frostpunk, which we are going to discuss briefly today, and I also had some, you know, indie adventures and that kind of things.

9
00:01:00,744 --> 00:01:03,065
You did not come here to listen about me.

10
00:01:03,425 --> 00:01:06,127
So, let's get to the topic at hand.

11
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:13,313
What is this authorial voice, this authorial intent that we are going to discuss?

12
00:01:13,433 --> 00:01:16,775
And this is actually the...

13
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:23,871
embedded worldview of the creator that is manifested in his work.

14
00:01:24,511 --> 00:01:29,632
And it can be transmitted through a few different means,

15
00:01:30,032 --> 00:01:33,873
through the style, through the perspective, through the point of view and through the tone.

16
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:40,454
But the concept is that the experience of life for any one of us, it's not the same.

17
00:01:40,874 --> 00:01:42,235
And the work we have created

18
00:01:42,853 --> 00:01:51,324
we are creating through our unique lens, kind of showing our inner walkings and our perspective

19
00:01:51,745 --> 00:01:58,314
on everything. And of course, as this term comes from literature theory,

20
00:01:59,265 --> 00:02:08,867
There's a lot of discussion if the authorial intent is conscious or is subconscious, if the author has any control over it.

21
00:02:09,027 --> 00:02:19,410
But here, let's take it at face value, because this is not a lecture about literature theory, and we are going to talk about games.

22
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,171
And also, you know, like a...

23
00:02:23,822 --> 00:02:33,265
So, let's look at it through some examples from other medium than games, then we'll get to the games, we'll discuss it on the games.

24
00:02:33,525 --> 00:02:37,586
But let's start with the movie and with the book, starting with The Catch-22.

25
00:02:38,327 --> 00:02:41,228
As you are probably aware, this is a book about war.

26
00:02:41,948 --> 00:02:42,068
One...

27
00:02:42,910 --> 00:02:49,037
many books about war, one of many books about World War II. But this one is kind

28
00:02:49,057 --> 00:02:55,343
of special because many of the books tell the heroic stories and how the war

29
00:02:55,463 --> 00:03:01,470
is sometimes the necessity and how as it brings the wars it also brings the best

30
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:03,152
in people. But Catch-22...

31
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,946
is the different book, the authorial voice is quite strongly heard in there and is a unique perspective, at least at the time,

32
00:03:11,927 --> 00:03:16,251
about how nonsensical and how violent and how pointless

33
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:18,033
war is.

34
00:03:18,934 --> 00:03:20,395
And the same with

35
00:03:21,399 --> 00:03:23,060
Everything is alright with us, the book...

36
00:03:23,841 --> 00:03:26,082
Sorry, the movie on the left.

37
00:03:26,583 --> 00:03:31,367
It is not about war, but some of the indie developers will tell you that it is about war.

38
00:03:31,807 --> 00:03:37,511
This is a movie about developing games, about developing an indie game.

39
00:03:38,204 --> 00:03:46,550
but is extremely different in tone and different in how it portrays some things than in the game the movie.

40
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:56,096
And again, I hope you can see that there is the same subject like war and making indie games in those two things,

41
00:03:56,496 --> 00:04:02,920
but the authorial voice, the authorial intent, the experience that is being told is vastly different.

42
00:04:03,461 --> 00:04:05,602
And that is kind of the point.

43
00:04:05,762 --> 00:04:07,363
Let's look at another example.

44
00:04:09,693 --> 00:04:16,741
Here we have two paintings, both of them are showing the war, both of them are showing atrocities of war, because both of them...

45
00:04:17,492 --> 00:04:27,197
were created to kind of show how cruel and horrible is war. But we can see how vastly different is the

46
00:04:27,237 --> 00:04:34,760
lens of Pablo Picasso and how vastly different is the lens of Francisco Goya. And at the time both

47
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:43,565
of those paintings did a huge thing, like people really resonated with that, that this is how the

48
00:04:43,605 --> 00:04:45,045
brutality of war looks.

49
00:04:47,347 --> 00:04:51,089
Look at those two, right? They cannot be more different.

50
00:04:51,469 --> 00:05:01,735
But this is that kind of a transformative character of us embedding our own view of the world into the things that we are doing.

51
00:05:02,737 --> 00:05:10,860
And also this is Saturn devouring his own children and it is here because I kind of love this painting

52
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:16,641
and we don't know what the authorial intent was of it, we don't know why Francisco Goya painted it.

53
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:24,783
It was never to be seen publicly, but it is and I find it kind of fitting in terms of a game

54
00:05:24,823 --> 00:05:31,205
designer devouring his own game design. But that was just a tangent, let's get back to the thing.

55
00:05:31,265 --> 00:05:31,385
So...

56
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:36,885
The authorial voice itself, it's a matter of communication.

57
00:05:37,525 --> 00:05:42,450
We are communicating and we are communicating through the things that we are doing.

58
00:05:43,351 --> 00:05:47,175
And sometimes the catch is that we do not do it consciously.

59
00:05:47,615 --> 00:05:48,676
But about that in a moment.

60
00:05:48,997 --> 00:05:54,602
First, let's kind of get, go through the idea, the games are like that.

61
00:05:56,265 --> 00:06:01,548
So how does it work in games? How do authorial intent manifests in games?

62
00:06:01,788 --> 00:06:05,330
And this is for future lectures, not this one. This one is 30 minutes.

63
00:06:06,471 --> 00:06:13,376
But there's also the question of whose authorial intent is it, especially when we are talking

64
00:06:13,516 --> 00:06:19,299
about not small indie games that are made by two, four, five people, but are made by companies of 10,000.

65
00:06:20,662 --> 00:06:27,404
OK, we are not on that level of size of companies, but, you know, companies of more of couple

66
00:06:27,444 --> 00:06:28,085
hundred people.

67
00:06:28,965 --> 00:06:30,746
Whose authorial intent is that?

68
00:06:31,866 --> 00:06:36,428
Just leaving it as a nugget, just, you know, stuck to that, you can think about it later

69
00:06:36,588 --> 00:06:37,068
if you would like.

70
00:06:37,288 --> 00:06:38,929
So, how does it work in games?

71
00:06:39,149 --> 00:06:41,030
How those things manifest?

72
00:06:42,122 --> 00:06:51,422
And of course we've got the most obvious channels, the story, the written down plot points that are exactly the same for every player.

73
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:57,982
And they are a very powerful tool to do that, especially in those movie-like games.

74
00:06:58,602 --> 00:07:03,464
Those really thrive on showing what they are trying to tell you through those story bits,

75
00:07:04,084 --> 00:07:08,465
which are then dressed in wonderful acting, voice acting animations.

76
00:07:08,585 --> 00:07:11,426
But the story, it's the same like with movies.

77
00:07:11,486 --> 00:07:16,428
Story is a great transmitter, great way for the authorial intent.

78
00:07:17,542 --> 00:07:31,385
And another example is Disco Elysium, the game that really clearly states through its story, through its texts, through the static bits that do not change what is their world view and what they are trying to say.

79
00:07:31,465 --> 00:07:34,306
And they are very conscious of that, which is great.

80
00:07:34,726 --> 00:07:36,346
And visuals.

81
00:07:37,526 --> 00:07:46,408
As you can imagine, a story is kind of a parallel to a book, but of course we know that writing for games is vastly different than writing books.

82
00:07:46,668 --> 00:07:46,828
But...

83
00:07:47,505 --> 00:07:56,092
the parallels exist. The visuals is a great parallel to paintings and, you know, the usual

84
00:07:56,753 --> 00:08:05,080
flat, not dynamic kind of art style. So, once again, this picture speaks a thousand words.

85
00:08:05,739 --> 00:08:12,281
And what is wonderful also with communicating with art is that it is not bounded by the limits of our language,

86
00:08:12,481 --> 00:08:19,524
because both visuals and, in a second, audio are things that can communicate things that we cannot say.

87
00:08:20,364 --> 00:08:27,706
Still, how we depict certain characters, how we depict certain situations visually,

88
00:08:28,447 --> 00:08:35,409
show our view of those situations, show our view of those characters, because it's our choice.

89
00:08:36,007 --> 00:08:39,349
or our game director, still not that discussion,

90
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:42,551
the view of that thing.

91
00:08:43,011 --> 00:08:45,813
Because the simple decision of

92
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:49,235
what characteristic of the character we are going to enlarge and

93
00:08:49,676 --> 00:08:52,398
draw the focus to, show what in

94
00:08:52,598 --> 00:08:56,100
our mind is important about that character. And this is our

95
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,122
authorial intent, conscious or not. So here,

96
00:08:59,742 --> 00:09:00,203
Hellblade.

97
00:09:01,462 --> 00:09:05,025
wonderfully, visually and wonderful game entirely,

98
00:09:05,265 --> 00:09:08,487
communicating in that aspect. And on the other hand,

99
00:09:08,627 --> 00:09:11,909
a vastly different kind of expression, still

100
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,131
extremely, extremely

101
00:09:15,992 --> 00:09:18,613
successful and extremely clear on what it's trying to say

102
00:09:18,934 --> 00:09:20,335
through its visuals.

103
00:09:21,117 --> 00:09:24,818
And as I already pointed forward, there's also the audio.

104
00:09:25,358 --> 00:09:30,720
And here I'm talking more about the sound design, but of course it also applies to music.

105
00:09:30,960 --> 00:09:36,302
It allows us to convey some authorial intent when we are describing something.

106
00:09:37,415 --> 00:09:47,521
Here we've got one great example of audio design showing space from the point of view of fear and being terrified.

107
00:09:47,721 --> 00:09:56,506
And this is a game that, you know, you need to change your pants afterwards because it is so nicely done and the audio design makes a lot of that.

108
00:09:56,726 --> 00:10:00,308
And on the other hand, space, exactly the same topic.

109
00:10:01,891 --> 00:10:10,354
can be vastly different and can be a place of wonder and curiosity, also thanks to its audio design, like in case of Outer Wilds.

110
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:15,115
But, Outer Wilds, sorry, two similar naming games, Outer Wilds.

111
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:22,257
So, that's all good and dandy, but there's that unique part about Medium.

112
00:10:23,518 --> 00:10:24,778
So what with the mechanics?

113
00:10:25,678 --> 00:10:31,280
Are mechanics a way of communicating things, or are they just for fun?

114
00:10:32,171 --> 00:10:35,934
as you can imagine from the, you know, talk title.

115
00:10:36,674 --> 00:10:40,477
I have my agenda in here, but in a moment, before we will jump to that,

116
00:10:42,178 --> 00:10:50,203
let's start with defining a vocabulary and some, you know, quick, brief, theoretical background,

117
00:10:50,303 --> 00:10:52,525
so we are talking about the same thing.

118
00:10:53,445 --> 00:10:59,089
Because, as you know, there are many lenses and many different approaches that you can look on design through.

119
00:10:59,249 --> 00:11:01,491
So, to have it all clear...

120
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,305
Let's go with the Brian's Upton definition from the wonderful book The Aesthetic of Play.

121
00:11:09,245 --> 00:11:16,591
So in this talk I'm going to conceptualize game design and game as a free movement in the system

122
00:11:16,611 --> 00:11:23,216
of constraints. A quick summary for those of you who are not familiar with that. I highly recommend

123
00:11:23,236 --> 00:11:27,319
getting familiar with that. The free movement in a system of constraints

124
00:11:28,003 --> 00:11:34,127
is an approach that looks at a game as a set of states and those states, if you are talking about

125
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:39,331
chess for example, every single combination of positions of different chess pieces

126
00:11:41,172 --> 00:11:47,836
is a different state and what the player does is he moves freely through those states. So we,

127
00:11:48,096 --> 00:11:48,917
as designers,

128
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:56,760
designing, for example, the rules of how the chess pieces move and what is the dimensions of the board,

129
00:11:58,081 --> 00:12:04,724
are dictating what kind of states the game will generate, right?

130
00:12:05,824 --> 00:12:10,466
So, we as designers, we create rules, those rules generate states.

131
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:17,484
and the player themselves walk through those states in that free movement in the system, the constraints.

132
00:12:18,285 --> 00:12:22,809
So, just to sum it up, the game consists of states that are created by us.

133
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:25,712
This is the bare minimum that we need from that slide.

134
00:12:26,313 --> 00:12:32,579
And another layer of that is that not all games are similar.

135
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:33,961
I know this is...

136
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,530
Not something groundbreaking, but not all games are the same.

137
00:12:39,391 --> 00:12:41,015
And let's look at them from one perspective.

138
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:54,751
let's look on them in terms of how big of an impact basic mechanics have on the narration.

139
00:12:55,371 --> 00:13:02,754
And when I'm saying narration, just to be clear, I'm not saying the fixed plot points,

140
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:09,677
I'm talking the whole story, the whole experience that is played in the player's mind while playing the game.

141
00:13:10,178 --> 00:13:13,719
Because due to the interactive nature of our medium,

142
00:13:14,783 --> 00:13:20,687
Between two players, almost always that narration will be slightly different.

143
00:13:23,049 --> 00:13:32,056
And why it will be different? It will be different through the smallest of decisions that may not change how the game is perceived.

144
00:13:32,136 --> 00:13:38,241
But still, the narration is slightly different because we decided to kill someone from the left and not someone from the right.

145
00:13:39,101 --> 00:13:41,103
But, using that kind of logic...

146
00:13:41,897 --> 00:13:46,320
we can look on the games over in those two axes.

147
00:13:47,281 --> 00:13:51,625
So on the x-axis we've got the impact of low-level mechanics

148
00:13:52,906 --> 00:13:58,810
on the narration itself and the y-axis is how different those narrations

149
00:13:58,990 --> 00:14:03,194
can be out of that game. So how different stories will be created

150
00:14:03,574 --> 00:14:06,076
from players to players' head, right? How different...

151
00:14:07,377 --> 00:14:09,719
how much difference there will be in the meaning itself.

152
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:10,740
And also...

153
00:14:11,604 --> 00:14:21,247
left lower corner we've got the movie-like experiences, those games that have a quite

154
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:26,588
similar narration in the head of all of the players, the low-level mechanics do not have

155
00:14:26,708 --> 00:14:31,949
a big impact and almost always the narration is more or less similar-ish, the same-ish,

156
00:14:32,610 --> 00:14:37,631
it's only those mundane details that no one cares, not changing from player to player.

157
00:14:38,331 --> 00:14:40,092
Again, left corner.

158
00:14:40,790 --> 00:14:45,854
left upper corner, we've got the branching narrative. The low-level mechanics, for example, in Witcher 3

159
00:14:46,414 --> 00:14:51,157
do not care so much from the narration. It does not matter how you are killing the monsters.

160
00:14:52,438 --> 00:15:00,082
It is important what kind of decisions you make in an important plot point,

161
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:07,607
moment. So it's a classical branching narrative. It is extremely effective to create the ownership

162
00:15:07,667 --> 00:15:08,928
of the story in the player.

163
00:15:09,711 --> 00:15:19,515
but it is also extremely pricey, because there's a lot of content that you have to create.

164
00:15:20,016 --> 00:15:26,378
And on the right side we have games that take a lot of its own narration from the low-level

165
00:15:26,418 --> 00:15:33,001
mechanics. So upper right corner we've got the anecdote kind of generator, so the Rim Wars,

166
00:15:33,081 --> 00:15:37,483
the Dwarf Fortress, and the power of those stories is that they are uniquely personal.

167
00:15:38,552 --> 00:15:43,194
They're usually stories of disaster and everyone dying, your little colony kingdom.

168
00:15:43,614 --> 00:15:52,418
But still, it was your way of them failing, and it came from a very, very low level mechanic and how you played.

169
00:15:52,498 --> 00:16:02,443
But the thing is, those... I'm not sure that that kind of anecdote generators are the best to convey certain meanings.

170
00:16:02,543 --> 00:16:04,744
If you want to convey a more complex idea...

171
00:16:05,422 --> 00:16:07,523
it would be harder with that kind of games.

172
00:16:07,643 --> 00:16:12,186
And that brings us to the last category that I, at this moment, find the most interesting.

173
00:16:12,686 --> 00:16:14,587
And this is those mechanical stories.

174
00:16:15,047 --> 00:16:24,373
So the game over on the higher level have quite strong idea that they want to convey.

175
00:16:25,355 --> 00:16:31,980
But how that narration develops is quite unique to the player because it comes from those low-level mechanics.

176
00:16:32,480 --> 00:16:40,705
So this is, I hope, how Frostpunk plays, this is how her story plays, because the outcome of that story for all of us is more or less the same.

177
00:16:41,085 --> 00:16:46,289
But all of us had a quite different and a unique experience how we got to that point.

178
00:16:46,409 --> 00:16:49,090
And I think this also makes this quite powerful.

179
00:16:49,700 --> 00:17:07,568
But why I'm bringing it now? Because in terms of speaking through the mechanics, it is more important to look on that kind of subject when you are more on the right of this graph and not on the left.

180
00:17:10,249 --> 00:17:13,130
So, that is the end of intermission.

181
00:17:13,781 --> 00:17:15,803
Let's get back to the topic at hand.

182
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:17,685
Mechanics.

183
00:17:18,866 --> 00:17:20,328
Do they convey something?

184
00:17:21,549 --> 00:17:29,057
And in my opinion, authorial voice manifests in all state generated by the mechanic.

185
00:17:29,637 --> 00:17:31,399
So our world view.

186
00:17:31,997 --> 00:17:36,139
our view of certain experiences is embedded in them.

187
00:17:36,779 --> 00:17:39,521
And not directly, because they are generated by the rules,

188
00:17:39,961 --> 00:17:45,184
but still, authorial voice manifests in state generated by the mechanics.

189
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:51,007
And also, this is the tricky part, the game designer is responsible

190
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:54,429
for all of the states that can be generated by the system.

191
00:17:54,809 --> 00:17:59,532
And in more than the obvious way, because of course we are

192
00:18:01,241 --> 00:18:08,205
we are responsible for all of them in terms of them being engaging and interesting choices.

193
00:18:08,465 --> 00:18:14,408
But we are also responsible about what those states are saying.

194
00:18:15,709 --> 00:18:18,490
But there's a small little thing, there's...

195
00:18:19,561 --> 00:18:24,205
a little caveat, because outside of normal states there are also interpretation states.

196
00:18:25,146 --> 00:18:31,372
And those states are mostly connected to what the player is imagining, what will happen next,

197
00:18:31,752 --> 00:18:41,521
and there's a lot more of player participation in creating of those states. So, due to that...

198
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:51,948
We cannot be responsible for them, because there's always that one person that will look on the rock and think about genocide.

199
00:18:52,328 --> 00:18:54,350
And this is not on us.

200
00:18:55,051 --> 00:18:55,891
But the other states?

201
00:18:57,052 --> 00:18:57,513
That's on us.

202
00:18:58,173 --> 00:18:59,314
But no one cares.

203
00:18:59,775 --> 00:19:04,819
Like, this sounds like kind of academic... pseudo-scientific thingy.

204
00:19:05,277 --> 00:19:09,760
But the thing is, as the medium is getting older and older,

205
00:19:10,361 --> 00:19:14,764
players, also as an audience, get more accustomed to reading the games

206
00:19:15,545 --> 00:19:17,786
in more than only surface levels.

207
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:21,489
They start to look at games, and they start to look at

208
00:19:21,950 --> 00:19:25,833
what the games are saying through the mechanics, not only through the story bits.

209
00:19:26,313 --> 00:19:28,435
And we already had a few examples of that.

210
00:19:29,313 --> 00:19:32,055
we had the Rim World Queer Woman controversy.

211
00:19:32,956 --> 00:19:36,758
The situation in here was that there was a certain worldview

212
00:19:37,139 --> 00:19:40,581
embedded in the mechanics of those games, how

213
00:19:41,782 --> 00:19:44,744
homosexuality and bisexuality of characters worked.

214
00:19:45,264 --> 00:19:48,026
And the thing is, the

215
00:19:48,287 --> 00:19:52,970
discussion there, it was, no, no, it was only for fun, but it is not like that.

216
00:19:53,230 --> 00:19:55,732
We are speaking through our systems.

217
00:19:57,619 --> 00:20:04,521
It's okay, because I'm not here to tell you, you know, this is the only right way, this is the police-fought kind of approach.

218
00:20:04,961 --> 00:20:09,183
No, just what is important is to know that we are saying things.

219
00:20:10,264 --> 00:20:15,125
And the same for many years what was with video game romance,

220
00:20:15,265 --> 00:20:22,308
because if you look on the purely systemic side of video game romance from the old days,

221
00:20:23,129 --> 00:20:25,610
those are vending machines for sex.

222
00:20:26,519 --> 00:20:32,784
just like that. You throw in good answers and compliments and eventually the sex will fall out.

223
00:20:33,525 --> 00:20:40,110
And I hope that this is not how relationship works and this is not how romance works.

224
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:46,135
But those systems were implying and were saying that this is how it is. It was for fun,

225
00:20:46,355 --> 00:20:51,079
it was for simplification. But players are starting to read those things and we are also

226
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:54,041
more aware that we are saying those things through those systems.

227
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:57,540
And it was the same with Frostpunk.

228
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:04,063
Frostpunk actually hit Thingy through its balance,

229
00:21:04,503 --> 00:21:09,146
because it was balanced through a really European-centric approach.

230
00:21:10,606 --> 00:21:15,168
And as so, when it was received by the Chinese players,

231
00:21:16,009 --> 00:21:19,811
it was quite weird for them how we balance certain things,

232
00:21:19,971 --> 00:21:24,113
because for us, some things were no-go, for them, they were okay.

233
00:21:24,613 --> 00:21:31,338
We were not fully aware that we were saying that thing from that, you know, quite fixed perspective.

234
00:21:31,978 --> 00:21:44,526
So, to go into a little bit much, little bigger details, let's go through the case of Frostpunk and what are you willing to sacrifice for gameplay.

235
00:21:44,686 --> 00:21:51,831
And let's look like that kind of authorial voice thinking, thinking of what we are saying is impacting the game design.

236
00:21:54,215 --> 00:22:01,380
Just to put it a little bit in context, Frostpunk is a survival city building game with a strong society component.

237
00:22:02,581 --> 00:22:10,686
So what is important for our story is that if your workplaces are not heated, your people will get sick.

238
00:22:10,966 --> 00:22:15,049
And eventually, if they are sick and not treated, an amputation may happen.

239
00:22:16,710 --> 00:22:21,593
So, we were playing around with that, amputation happened, but...

240
00:22:22,638 --> 00:22:33,043
The systemic idea behind that was when an amputation happens, that little human in Frostpunk is taken away from the force, from the workforce.

241
00:22:33,703 --> 00:22:40,307
So the player has less resources on that side, so that would be a strong enough incentive to hit all of the places.

242
00:22:42,042 --> 00:22:56,328
But as the time progressed, we found out that actually the amount of people that the player has to distribute among workforces is not a problem.

243
00:22:57,128 --> 00:23:00,369
He has more people than workplaces.

244
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:05,571
So that kind of incentive was not a thing. It did not work.

245
00:23:05,691 --> 00:23:08,132
So we started to discuss what can we do.

246
00:23:08,392 --> 00:23:10,673
And who is responsible for the society?

247
00:23:13,022 --> 00:23:24,272
I was like, okay, let's look at this idea, let's look at all of the systems that we can, what we can poke and stick together to have a stronger incentive for the player to eventually hit those places.

248
00:23:24,392 --> 00:23:28,396
So, a bigger penalty connected to the amputations.

249
00:23:29,057 --> 00:23:35,182
As we already had a system that was connected with the Discontent and Hope, we started to play with an idea.

250
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:44,905
that those people without those limbs may have a chance to commit suicide, which would have a

251
00:23:45,225 --> 00:23:50,966
ripple effect, because this is something that has a ripple effect on the community. So this way the

252
00:23:51,006 --> 00:23:56,567
player would have stronger incentive outside of Morrowind to hit those places and do not make

253
00:23:56,587 --> 00:24:00,608
that happen. So we implemented that mechanic, played around, set a percentage.

254
00:24:03,703 --> 00:24:07,345
I still did not feel the penalty enough, so I tweaked the numbers, played again.

255
00:24:10,346 --> 00:24:11,927
Tweaked the numbers, played again.

256
00:24:12,447 --> 00:24:15,388
Tweaked the numbers, played again, tweaked the numbers, played again, tweaked the numbers,

257
00:24:15,428 --> 00:24:15,888
played again.

258
00:24:17,049 --> 00:24:20,690
Now it was working, and the tester was like, yeah, yeah, I feel the incentive.

259
00:24:21,570 --> 00:24:27,073
And I looked in the config, and every person after amputation every day had a 50% chance

260
00:24:27,113 --> 00:24:28,373
to commit suicide.

261
00:24:29,534 --> 00:24:31,674
And now a problem arose.

262
00:24:34,267 --> 00:24:45,783
It worked mechanically, it was engaging, but this was not the world view that I held, and this is not something that I wanted to say in that game, as this is a semi-realistic game.

263
00:24:46,424 --> 00:24:46,605
So...

264
00:24:47,382 --> 00:24:54,028
Eventually, we scrapped that idea and we worked an entirely different system to have that

265
00:24:54,088 --> 00:24:54,908
kind of a penalty.

266
00:24:55,028 --> 00:25:02,194
We added a special kind of discontent where different people are not part of the workforce.

267
00:25:02,254 --> 00:25:03,155
We added protests.

268
00:25:03,255 --> 00:25:14,384
We added a lot of additional context to put it in a correct context because that was important

269
00:25:14,504 --> 00:25:16,566
and to offer that kind of interesting.

270
00:25:17,437 --> 00:25:23,379
gameplay and eventually there was even a law about allowing people with

271
00:25:23,419 --> 00:25:27,780
amputations to walk in different places to have the prosthetics for them and

272
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:37,382
this is the moment for you know self-tap all of that but the thing is not only

273
00:25:37,422 --> 00:25:41,263
the systems are the problem but before we go there

274
00:25:42,031 --> 00:25:45,236
This was not only such a problem in Frostpunk.

275
00:25:45,616 --> 00:25:50,062
We touched, because this is a society game, we touched on many different subjects.

276
00:25:50,904 --> 00:25:55,089
And some of them are really sensitive, some of them are really important,

277
00:25:55,129 --> 00:25:58,214
some of them are everyday experiences of other people.

278
00:25:59,796 --> 00:26:07,161
treat those things lightly for the sake of entertainment itself. So for some of

279
00:26:07,241 --> 00:26:12,465
things we just cut them out because there was not enough time to kind of you

280
00:26:12,505 --> 00:26:19,571
know do it the right way so the best way was to cut it out and as I'm saying not

281
00:26:19,731 --> 00:26:22,793
only the systems are the problem because math itself is

282
00:26:25,845 --> 00:26:31,628
embedded with meaning. When you are balancing a system, when you are balancing laws, when you are

283
00:26:31,688 --> 00:26:38,732
saying how much of people will be mad about one law and another, you are showing your view of the

284
00:26:38,772 --> 00:26:45,556
world. Because there is no such a thing as an objective algorithm on an objective balance.

285
00:26:45,817 --> 00:26:48,818
You are picking what kind of laws is more.

286
00:26:50,689 --> 00:26:52,650
making people more angry and less

287
00:26:52,970 --> 00:26:55,971
and that decision comes from your internal values

288
00:26:56,991 --> 00:27:00,912
and it's for all of those things there is no such a thing as

289
00:27:01,213 --> 00:27:04,594
no no objectively this is the thing that should add plus five

290
00:27:04,674 --> 00:27:06,574
this is a thing that should add plus one

291
00:27:08,464 --> 00:27:14,288
it is the balance is also the expression of your personal views and sometimes those are mundane

292
00:27:14,328 --> 00:27:21,093
things you think that the sword is a better attack thing than an axe but sometimes it's bigger things

293
00:27:21,694 --> 00:27:29,040
like do you think that immigration uh makes the high crime rate go higher or does not impact them

294
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:36,185
at all and just you know those things are expression of your personal views even if you don't want them

295
00:27:37,416 --> 00:27:46,218
So you can imagine how different of a game this War of Mine would be if, for example, the food was planted.

296
00:27:46,418 --> 00:27:54,020
This is a stupid idea, but this is a depiction of war through the lens of people who made this War of Mine.

297
00:27:54,420 --> 00:27:59,521
And the math in there is their depiction of what they think the war is, right?

298
00:28:01,221 --> 00:28:03,002
But of course not all systems are like that.

299
00:28:03,542 --> 00:28:05,142
And not all systems...

300
00:28:07,049 --> 00:28:09,250
require care in those terms.

301
00:28:10,972 --> 00:28:16,236
You can have a fully abstract game like Opus Magnum and there, go wild!

302
00:28:16,576 --> 00:28:22,181
Those systems will tell only the story of your imagination about an abstract system

303
00:28:22,281 --> 00:28:25,404
of chemical bonds and that's all.

304
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:26,865
You don't have to be worried.

305
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:36,153
But when rooted in reality and when showing reality, you show your view of the reality.

306
00:28:37,020 --> 00:28:43,462
So, when designing or balancing, remember that you are also talking, because your authorial

307
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:51,204
voice as a designer and as an author is embedded in this balance and is embedded in those mechanics.

308
00:28:51,904 --> 00:28:57,266
And just, you know, be aware of that, because you can say the most silly thing, just be

309
00:28:57,386 --> 00:28:59,407
aware that you are saying those things.

310
00:29:01,015 --> 00:29:08,704
So, I wish you great GDC, also happy Pride Month, because I'm recording this in June,

311
00:29:09,645 --> 00:29:10,827
and goodbye!
