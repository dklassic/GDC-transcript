1
00:00:06,576 --> 00:00:11,280
So my name is Elisabeth Mahler, and today I would like to talk to you about the process

2
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:18,906
of creating two social impact games that I've worked on, Normal Lost Phone and Another Lost

3
00:00:18,906 --> 00:00:20,047
Phone Lower Story.

4
00:00:20,047 --> 00:00:27,693
These two games are games where you find a phone, and you have to find out what happened

5
00:00:27,693 --> 00:00:34,519
to the owner of the phone by looking through the different applications, reading the emails,

6
00:00:34,519 --> 00:00:35,420
looking into the gallery.

7
00:00:37,133 --> 00:00:43,998
They are presented as investigative games, but through storytelling, they make people

8
00:00:43,998 --> 00:00:49,502
think about important themes such as homophobia or abusive relationships.

9
00:00:49,502 --> 00:00:53,184
We sold more than 200,000 copies of these games.

10
00:00:53,184 --> 00:00:58,868
And these games also had a real impact on a large number of people.

11
00:00:58,868 --> 00:01:04,552
As you can see from different messages we have received.

12
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:09,942
This game helped me come out of the closet.

13
00:01:09,942 --> 00:01:18,271
This game made me realize that I was homophobic and that I had to change.

14
00:01:18,271 --> 00:01:20,133
This game has helped me accept my past.

15
00:01:20,133 --> 00:01:25,258
This game made me realize I was too jealous and I had to work on it.

16
00:01:28,041 --> 00:01:34,749
All these different reactions are what I call direct social impact.

17
00:01:34,749 --> 00:01:39,755
Someone plays a game whose objective is to make them think about a subject,

18
00:01:39,755 --> 00:01:43,159
and this game provokes a direct reaction.

19
00:01:45,031 --> 00:01:52,794
I will give you some advice on how to design games with a direct social impact in a second

20
00:01:52,794 --> 00:01:59,296
part of this talk, but first I would like to talk to you about indirect social impact.

21
00:01:59,296 --> 00:02:10,319
Indirect social impact is the fact that any creation, whether we intend it or not, will

22
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:12,900
have a social impact on its audience.

23
00:02:14,498 --> 00:02:18,379
To take a more personal example, when I was a teenager,

24
00:02:18,379 --> 00:02:21,060
I read a lot of mangas.

25
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:24,581
On one side, I read a lot of shoujos, mangas for girls.

26
00:02:24,581 --> 00:02:27,522
In these mangas, there were always

27
00:02:27,522 --> 00:02:33,124
girls looking for prince charming

28
00:02:33,124 --> 00:02:38,725
and also looking for the best way to satisfy prince charming.

29
00:02:40,884 --> 00:02:45,087
At the same time, I was reading a lot of shōnen, mangas for boys.

30
00:02:45,087 --> 00:02:53,754
And in the mangas I've read, all the boys were presented as sex maniacs, without exception.

31
00:02:53,754 --> 00:03:00,079
I was quite young and I didn't have much perspective yet.

32
00:03:00,079 --> 00:03:08,485
And these two parallel readings pushed me into the beginning of my love and sex life with two beliefs.

33
00:03:10,500 --> 00:03:16,142
First, my role was to find Prince Charming and to satisfy him.

34
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,222
That's what I have learned from the Chojos.

35
00:03:18,222 --> 00:03:22,124
But also, I had to accept all his sexual desires,

36
00:03:22,124 --> 00:03:25,505
because all men were sex-obsessed,

37
00:03:25,505 --> 00:03:31,007
without exception, including Prince Charming.

38
00:03:31,007 --> 00:03:33,768
That's what I have learned from the Shonans.

39
00:03:33,768 --> 00:03:38,569
If you want my opinion, it was really not the best way

40
00:03:38,569 --> 00:03:39,870
to start young adult life.

41
00:03:43,417 --> 00:03:47,018
What I'm trying to say here is not that mangas are evil,

42
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:49,699
and that I regret having read them.

43
00:03:49,699 --> 00:03:52,700
Not at all.

44
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,340
What gets me thinking here is that I'm not sure

45
00:03:54,340 --> 00:04:00,082
that the authors of this manga, while living in Japan,

46
00:04:00,082 --> 00:04:02,123
were thinking about the influence

47
00:04:02,123 --> 00:04:05,344
that their works could have on a French teenage girl.

48
00:04:05,344 --> 00:04:08,025
And that's indirect social impact.

49
00:04:09,174 --> 00:04:16,402
Every work we create has an impact, and as authors, we have a responsibility to think

50
00:04:16,402 --> 00:04:17,483
about the creation we make.

51
00:04:17,483 --> 00:04:23,330
Our responsibility as authors is not a choice.

52
00:04:23,330 --> 00:04:25,773
It is a fact, and we cannot ignore it.

53
00:04:25,773 --> 00:04:30,758
That's why we have to make at least inclusive games.

54
00:04:32,974 --> 00:04:42,443
Making an inclusive game is an approach that consists in thinking about the impact that each creative decision could have,

55
00:04:42,443 --> 00:04:47,928
and seeking to limit, as much as possible, any potential negative impact.

56
00:04:47,928 --> 00:04:55,535
Making an inclusive game is essential, but it's not the same as making an activist game.

57
00:04:59,127 --> 00:05:04,930
To make an activist game is to make a game for which you intentionally seek to express

58
00:05:04,930 --> 00:05:07,611
active support for a cause.

59
00:05:07,611 --> 00:05:14,754
It's not something that you should feel compelled to do, because it's risky, both commercially

60
00:05:14,754 --> 00:05:15,374
and militantly.

61
00:05:15,374 --> 00:05:22,358
Commercially risky because it will hinder some people and potentially generate lifestyle

62
00:05:22,358 --> 00:05:22,798
sales.

63
00:05:23,745 --> 00:05:27,726
and militantly risky, because it's really hard, actually,

64
00:05:27,726 --> 00:05:30,988
to make a good game with real impact.

65
00:05:30,988 --> 00:05:35,870
I will therefore give you some advice and tips

66
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:39,052
that we used for A Normal Lost Fawn

67
00:05:39,052 --> 00:05:40,932
and Another Lost Fawn Lore Story.

68
00:05:40,932 --> 00:05:44,954
The first particularity of these games

69
00:05:44,954 --> 00:05:47,135
is that unlike other games,

70
00:05:47,135 --> 00:05:50,277
you are not asked to play a character.

71
00:05:51,865 --> 00:05:56,790
in which you do not recognize yourself and with whom you have difficulty identifying.

72
00:05:58,325 --> 00:06:00,686
In this game, you play as yourself.

73
00:06:00,686 --> 00:06:03,728
You are the one who found the phone.

74
00:06:03,728 --> 00:06:05,829
You are not the owner of the phone.

75
00:06:05,829 --> 00:06:08,571
You are playing yourself searching through a lost phone.

76
00:06:08,571 --> 00:06:12,173
This means that at no time do you

77
00:06:12,173 --> 00:06:15,355
find yourself playing a character that

78
00:06:15,355 --> 00:06:16,636
doesn't look like you.

79
00:06:16,636 --> 00:06:21,699
And you should never make them choose from proposals

80
00:06:21,699 --> 00:06:23,140
that you don't like at all.

81
00:06:26,402 --> 00:06:31,323
Here, the choices have already been made by the protagonist.

82
00:06:31,323 --> 00:06:36,965
And you are just asked to try to understand

83
00:06:36,965 --> 00:06:40,826
what prompted the protagonist to make those choices.

84
00:06:40,826 --> 00:06:46,707
However, these mechanics had some failures,

85
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,348
especially in the first game.

86
00:06:48,348 --> 00:06:52,649
In order to have more interactivity,

87
00:06:52,649 --> 00:06:54,710
that is for gameplay reason,

88
00:06:55,572 --> 00:06:59,815
we had set up an unsent draft mechanic.

89
00:06:59,815 --> 00:07:03,077
That is, at times, you come across message

90
00:07:03,077 --> 00:07:05,058
that has not been sent,

91
00:07:05,058 --> 00:07:08,119
and you must send them to receive a response

92
00:07:08,119 --> 00:07:12,742
that contains information that allows you

93
00:07:12,742 --> 00:07:17,045
to move on to the next part of the game.

94
00:07:19,079 --> 00:07:23,220
It's something that really caused a problem for a lot of players, and rightly so.

95
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,921
They didn't like interfering that much in the character's life, and they were disturbed

96
00:07:29,921 --> 00:07:37,943
by the message that could be implied, that it was okay to search and interfere in someone's

97
00:07:37,943 --> 00:07:38,043
life.

98
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:44,164
This is a negative impact that has not been considered when designing the game, nor had

99
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:48,165
it been brought up during playtests.

100
00:07:50,412 --> 00:07:58,094
One of the reasons I don't think anyone gave us feedback about these problematic issues

101
00:07:58,094 --> 00:08:04,996
is that all the people who tested the game were people who knew us directly or indirectly.

102
00:08:04,996 --> 00:08:08,438
But most important, they knew our intentions.

103
00:08:08,438 --> 00:08:17,601
Since those people knew that our intentions were good, they didn't perceive the possible

104
00:08:17,601 --> 00:08:20,262
bad consequences of what we were doing.

105
00:08:23,153 --> 00:08:29,636
This problem on the first game helped us better think the design of the second game,

106
00:08:29,636 --> 00:08:31,576
and three major changes were made.

107
00:08:31,576 --> 00:08:38,739
For starters, at the launch of the game, we added a message to remind people

108
00:08:38,739 --> 00:08:44,161
that the game is a work of fiction and that in real life, we must not invade anyone's privacy.

109
00:08:50,824 --> 00:08:57,727
It's interesting that we had to put this type of message in the game because in an FPS for

110
00:08:57,727 --> 00:09:04,671
example, you rarely see messages saying actually killing is wrong, please don't do it in real

111
00:09:04,671 --> 00:09:12,374
life. But since searching through a phone, it's something much more widespread. I'm sure some

112
00:09:12,374 --> 00:09:16,196
people in this room have done that.

113
00:09:17,936 --> 00:09:20,097
It becomes a necessary reminder

114
00:09:20,097 --> 00:09:23,939
that it is not something to be done

115
00:09:23,939 --> 00:09:25,700
in order to avoid tribalizing it.

116
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:27,101
The other change in Another Lost Phone

117
00:09:27,101 --> 00:09:31,923
is that there are never any drafts to send.

118
00:09:31,923 --> 00:09:33,724
When we thought about it,

119
00:09:33,724 --> 00:09:36,806
we found other gameplay mechanics

120
00:09:36,806 --> 00:09:39,267
to help the story move forward.

121
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:43,329
And we realized there are always other solutions.

122
00:09:48,997 --> 00:09:54,618
The last change we made in Under the Law of the Throne was the end of the game.

123
00:09:54,618 --> 00:10:00,979
There are three ways to end the game and one of them is actually a completely valid way,

124
00:10:00,979 --> 00:10:06,420
but then the game is really, really short, is that you open the game and then you erase

125
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:09,841
the data from the phone and you don't look through anything.

126
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:14,582
And there's even an achievement for that because it's a noble way to play this game

127
00:10:14,582 --> 00:10:15,622
to decide not to play it.

128
00:10:21,642 --> 00:10:25,323
Another advice I would like to give to people

129
00:10:25,323 --> 00:10:27,924
who want to develop games with a social impact

130
00:10:27,924 --> 00:10:29,725
is to choose your battles.

131
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:32,626
Could you raise hands if you are planning

132
00:10:32,626 --> 00:10:35,467
or if you worked on a game with a direct social impact

133
00:10:35,467 --> 00:10:38,548
or if you want to do it one day?

134
00:10:38,548 --> 00:10:40,769
Okay, that's a lot of people.

135
00:10:40,769 --> 00:10:42,229
Good, I congratulate you.

136
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:43,650
You all want to change the world.

137
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:47,551
That's amazing.

138
00:10:49,455 --> 00:10:57,820
I wanted to tell you that if you try to open the player's eyes on a lot of different topics

139
00:10:57,820 --> 00:11:00,021
at the same time, it's a guaranteed disaster.

140
00:11:00,021 --> 00:11:05,824
Think of it as glasses.

141
00:11:05,824 --> 00:11:13,327
If you give glasses to someone who is not used to wear them, it will take them some

142
00:11:13,327 --> 00:11:14,108
time to adjust.

143
00:11:15,811 --> 00:11:18,932
If you give them glasses with very thick lenses,

144
00:11:18,932 --> 00:11:25,134
it will give them a headache and they will remove them right away.

145
00:11:25,134 --> 00:11:27,655
Activism is the same.

146
00:11:27,655 --> 00:11:34,197
You can't expect that overnight, thanks to your game,

147
00:11:34,197 --> 00:11:38,098
your audience will become super awake on all subjects.

148
00:11:39,882 --> 00:11:45,647
I therefore advise you to focus on a subject that is close to your heart, to make this

149
00:11:45,647 --> 00:11:52,053
the main theme, and for the other subjects that are important to see, instead of having

150
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:55,135
an activist angle, having an inclusive angle.

151
00:11:55,135 --> 00:12:03,883
For example, in a normal law firm, we never talk about racism, because it's a heavy, complex

152
00:12:03,883 --> 00:12:07,146
subject, and it cannot be approached as lightly.

153
00:12:08,738 --> 00:12:12,861
However, we tried to at least have an inclusive angle on this issue.

154
00:12:12,861 --> 00:12:19,666
We have very different characters and at no time do people use racist insults, for example.

155
00:12:19,666 --> 00:12:20,446
Another example.

156
00:12:20,446 --> 00:12:23,268
I like to talk about animal exploitation issues, which are important to me personally.

157
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:41,686
So in a normal Lost Phone, there's a secondary character

158
00:12:41,686 --> 00:12:42,466
that talks about it.

159
00:12:42,466 --> 00:12:46,550
But it's just a little anecdote in the background.

160
00:12:46,550 --> 00:12:52,055
The protagonist has a friend who is vegan,

161
00:12:52,055 --> 00:12:55,758
just like they have another one who likes board games.

162
00:12:55,758 --> 00:12:59,482
In another Lost Phone, in Laura's note,

163
00:12:59,482 --> 00:13:02,605
we find a recipe for stuffed zucchinis.

164
00:13:04,938 --> 00:13:12,864
The recipe turns out to be vegan, but there is no mention of any time that it is specifically

165
00:13:12,864 --> 00:13:13,665
a vegan recipe.

166
00:13:13,665 --> 00:13:18,608
However, there are players who try to reproduce the recipe, and therefore they ate vegan that

167
00:13:18,608 --> 00:13:18,668
day.

168
00:13:18,668 --> 00:13:19,809
You want to make a social impact game?

169
00:13:19,809 --> 00:13:21,731
I advise you also to avoid having a moralizing gameplay.

170
00:13:33,072 --> 00:13:39,158
Avoid having rules in the game that do not allow the player to move forward

171
00:13:39,158 --> 00:13:44,142
until they agree with the message you are trying to convey.

172
00:13:44,142 --> 00:13:48,766
In the Lost Friends series, players are never told

173
00:13:48,766 --> 00:13:51,408
that they are wrong to think as they do.

174
00:13:51,408 --> 00:13:55,992
This allows them to continue and finish the game.

175
00:13:55,992 --> 00:14:00,296
In Character Writing 2, we try not to be too mannequin.

176
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:08,004
characters who have a vision of the world that we do not share,

177
00:14:08,004 --> 00:14:10,806
well, these characters, they have other qualities.

178
00:14:10,806 --> 00:14:16,611
And this is important if we want the people who actually think like these people

179
00:14:16,611 --> 00:14:22,595
to connect maybe with them and to not feel too attacked when after that we say that,

180
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:26,258
you know, maybe you shouldn't think that.

181
00:14:26,258 --> 00:14:29,560
To make a good game,

182
00:14:31,055 --> 00:14:34,157
In absolute terms, it's necessary to do playtests

183
00:14:34,157 --> 00:14:37,220
to check if the game is understandable and pleasant

184
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:37,620
to use.

185
00:14:37,620 --> 00:14:40,603
I'm a big fan of playtests.

186
00:14:40,603 --> 00:14:44,846
When we make games with social impact,

187
00:14:44,846 --> 00:14:49,770
we also need to do playtests to test this social impact.

188
00:14:51,271 --> 00:14:54,131
And in order to do this, you have to playtest your game

189
00:14:54,131 --> 00:14:56,632
with people who knows a lot about the topic

190
00:14:56,632 --> 00:14:58,212
you are talking about, and also people playtesting

191
00:14:58,212 --> 00:15:00,253
the game with people who don't know anything about it.

192
00:15:00,253 --> 00:15:03,253
On a normal lost phone, what we did is that we ask people

193
00:15:03,253 --> 00:15:05,213
to play the game, and after that to explain the story

194
00:15:05,213 --> 00:15:05,874
of the protagonist from A to Z.

195
00:15:21,063 --> 00:15:28,853
This made it possible to discover misunderstanding and the need to explain in detail certain

196
00:15:28,853 --> 00:15:31,156
points that seem really obvious for us.

197
00:15:31,156 --> 00:15:38,125
For example, it's really silly, but we realize that some people don't know what LGBT stands

198
00:15:38,125 --> 00:15:38,205
for.

199
00:15:40,089 --> 00:15:45,032
For us it was obvious but it made us realize that we had to add at some point in the game

200
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:49,856
someone explaining what it is because it's not obvious for everyone, especially people

201
00:15:49,856 --> 00:15:51,617
outside the LGBT community.

202
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:59,403
Also testing the game with people from the LGBT community raised some other problematic

203
00:15:59,403 --> 00:16:04,507
issues on the game in relation to the message we were trying to get across.

204
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:09,053
There was indeed a part of the game

205
00:16:09,053 --> 00:16:12,415
where we talked about the suicide

206
00:16:12,415 --> 00:16:14,095
and murder rates of LGBT people.

207
00:16:14,095 --> 00:16:17,657
This information was not false,

208
00:16:17,657 --> 00:16:25,080
but we were told that this could lead some teenagers

209
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:27,321
not to come out because of fear,

210
00:16:27,321 --> 00:16:30,942
which was not our goal, so we removed this part.

211
00:16:30,942 --> 00:16:35,664
A normal loss fund was first created during a game jam.

212
00:16:36,904 --> 00:16:42,228
So a large part of the story was created in 48 hours.

213
00:16:42,228 --> 00:16:48,372
This means that there were no pre-production process

214
00:16:48,372 --> 00:16:51,053
with actual time to reflect

215
00:16:51,053 --> 00:16:53,795
on the message we wanted to convey.

216
00:16:53,795 --> 00:16:56,077
So a prototype was developed and then shown

217
00:16:56,077 --> 00:17:02,841
to people from the LGBT community in order to improve it.

218
00:17:02,841 --> 00:17:04,382
On another law firm, however,

219
00:17:07,168 --> 00:17:12,130
We wanted to take the time to do some research before writing the script.

220
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:18,231
We knew we wanted to talk about toxic relationships.

221
00:17:18,231 --> 00:17:22,672
So I spent several months reading a lot about it.

222
00:17:22,672 --> 00:17:28,814
Essays, scientific articles, autobiographies, even some novels.

223
00:17:28,814 --> 00:17:35,415
I then contacted the Victim Support Association to ask for their help.

224
00:17:36,890 --> 00:17:40,253
It was difficult at first to convince them to work with us.

225
00:17:40,253 --> 00:17:47,900
Like, what, you want to make a game about abusive relationships, about domestic violence?

226
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:52,605
We had to explain that games can be used for something else than just entertainment.

227
00:17:55,066 --> 00:18:01,829
Finally, we managed to convince them by showing them videos made by famous YouTubers on a normal loss form.

228
00:18:01,829 --> 00:18:07,151
And by showing them all the comment sections of these videos on YouTube,

229
00:18:07,151 --> 00:18:09,512
and all the people saying that the game helped them,

230
00:18:09,512 --> 00:18:13,194
that's what convinced the organization to say,

231
00:18:13,194 --> 00:18:17,355
Oh, okay, interesting way to change the world.

232
00:18:17,355 --> 00:18:18,376
We'll try to do that with you.

233
00:18:25,148 --> 00:18:36,136
In terms of process of writing, we had made progress on the scenario in a gradual way.

234
00:18:36,136 --> 00:18:47,985
Step one, we asked the organisation to think the subject, how it should be addressed.

235
00:18:47,985 --> 00:18:51,668
On the issue of abusive relationships...

236
00:18:52,321 --> 00:18:56,203
We were told that what was most misunderstood

237
00:18:56,203 --> 00:18:58,745
by the majority of the population

238
00:18:58,745 --> 00:19:02,207
was the way the cycle of violence works.

239
00:19:02,207 --> 00:19:04,108
Google it after the presentation.

240
00:19:04,108 --> 00:19:09,211
Which explains why so many victims do not leave

241
00:19:09,211 --> 00:19:10,972
the person who abuses them.

242
00:19:13,313 --> 00:19:18,299
The other thing that is often misunderstood by the majority of the population

243
00:19:18,299 --> 00:19:27,128
is the importance of psychological violence and how it precedes physical violence.

244
00:19:29,563 --> 00:19:37,345
Once we had these important elements, it allowed us to choose the approach to the story.

245
00:19:37,345 --> 00:19:44,606
We had to write a story that would explain the cycle of violence and that would focus

246
00:19:44,606 --> 00:19:45,427
maybe on psychological violence.

247
00:19:45,427 --> 00:19:50,888
So then I wrote a one-page synopsis outlining Loa's stories.

248
00:19:52,396 --> 00:20:00,582
This document was started by the organization that was helping them, and they corrected

249
00:20:00,582 --> 00:20:03,985
some points to keep us from falling into clichés.

250
00:20:03,985 --> 00:20:09,749
Once a new synopsis was written and approved,

251
00:20:10,520 --> 00:20:12,881
we worked on a walkthrough of the game,

252
00:20:12,881 --> 00:20:14,842
and we asked them to review it.

253
00:20:14,842 --> 00:20:18,343
The walkthrough of the game, it was a Flora story,

254
00:20:18,343 --> 00:20:22,785
the same as in the synopsis, but with more details,

255
00:20:22,785 --> 00:20:25,906
and especially it was showing the order

256
00:20:25,906 --> 00:20:27,787
in which the player would discover

257
00:20:27,787 --> 00:20:30,428
the different parts of Flora's story.

258
00:20:30,428 --> 00:20:31,489
Again, with this walkthrough,

259
00:20:31,489 --> 00:20:36,311
we worked on the details together.

260
00:20:38,207 --> 00:20:45,069
And it was only after that this walkthrough was written, proofread,

261
00:20:45,069 --> 00:20:46,630
that we set about writing the entire story.

262
00:20:46,630 --> 00:20:53,332
This method was very effective, because it allowed us to know exactly

263
00:20:53,332 --> 00:20:58,434
where we were going, without having to write whole parts of the story

264
00:20:58,434 --> 00:21:01,895
and then finally remove them, as we'd done for a normal loss form.

265
00:21:04,968 --> 00:21:09,050
We have some time for questions, but I really hope that this talk has helped you to think

266
00:21:09,050 --> 00:21:14,292
about the design of your games, whether you want them to have direct social impact or

267
00:21:14,292 --> 00:21:17,573
whether you know it will have indirect social impact.

268
00:21:17,573 --> 00:21:25,057
And there's a mic somewhere over there for the questions.

269
00:21:33,733 --> 00:21:36,276
And if you could start by introducing yourself,

270
00:21:36,276 --> 00:21:37,156
it would be great.

271
00:21:37,156 --> 00:21:38,197
Hi, my name's Laura.

272
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:40,079
I'm working on a similar project

273
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:44,302
where I'm trying to create an AR experience,

274
00:21:44,302 --> 00:21:45,823
but working with stakeholders

275
00:21:45,823 --> 00:21:49,106
in Native American communities.

276
00:21:49,106 --> 00:21:50,947
And I guess my question is,

277
00:21:50,947 --> 00:21:55,051
if you had presented this idea to, say, victims

278
00:21:55,051 --> 00:21:57,833
or people that are allies or working with those victims,

279
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:58,493
and they had said,

280
00:21:59,572 --> 00:22:00,636
don't do this.

281
00:22:00,636 --> 00:22:02,742
Would you have changed your course

282
00:22:02,742 --> 00:22:04,487
or how would you have approached that?

283
00:22:06,078 --> 00:22:09,360
I guess...

284
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,081
Well, that's what they did actually, first, the organization.

285
00:22:12,081 --> 00:22:14,582
They say, oh, why do you want to make a game?

286
00:22:14,582 --> 00:22:18,103
And then we ask them why they think it's not a good idea.

287
00:22:18,103 --> 00:22:22,745
And by understanding why they were thinking it was a bad idea,

288
00:22:22,745 --> 00:22:27,747
we realized that they were not understanding what we had in mind.

289
00:22:27,747 --> 00:22:31,969
So, I guess, talking more, trying to understand why and...

290
00:22:33,650 --> 00:22:34,910
It's difficult to answer.

291
00:22:34,910 --> 00:22:35,530
No, I know.

292
00:22:35,530 --> 00:22:37,911
Like, hypothetical things.

293
00:22:37,911 --> 00:22:39,212
I'm in the same boat right now too.

294
00:22:39,212 --> 00:22:45,194
We've gotten a lot of support from the community, but also we've sort of developed something,

295
00:22:45,194 --> 00:22:46,954
and now we actually have to take it back to them.

296
00:22:46,954 --> 00:22:50,936
And I'm a little apprehensive, because I'm like, what if they, you know, like it could

297
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:53,336
derail a lot of the work we've done.

298
00:22:53,336 --> 00:22:58,738
But I mean, the goal has always been to work with communities to amplify their voice, not

299
00:22:58,738 --> 00:23:01,119
necessarily to put our own spin on it.

300
00:23:01,928 --> 00:23:06,471
At the same time, we have sort of the keys to the kingdom in terms of the technology,

301
00:23:06,471 --> 00:23:06,751
you know.

302
00:23:06,751 --> 00:23:06,831
Yeah.

303
00:23:06,831 --> 00:23:06,971
So.

304
00:23:06,971 --> 00:23:08,252
Well, you have to work with them from the A to Z anyway.

305
00:23:08,252 --> 00:23:08,412
Thank you.

306
00:23:08,412 --> 00:23:08,552
Hi there.

307
00:23:08,552 --> 00:23:08,752
My name's Sam.

308
00:23:08,752 --> 00:23:13,314
I'm a software developer, and I've done a lot of outreach activities with students in

309
00:23:13,314 --> 00:23:14,795
schools from low-income families.

310
00:23:14,795 --> 00:23:15,875
And one of the things I know from that experience is.

311
00:23:31,096 --> 00:23:36,398
there's a difference between knowing the facts about like learning like hey like you know

312
00:23:36,398 --> 00:23:40,239
Maybe I should do this or should not do this versus like changing behavior

313
00:23:40,239 --> 00:23:44,281
And I was wondering like how your team worked on that like for your games like to actually

314
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:47,242
Did you address trying to change player behavior?

315
00:23:47,242 --> 00:23:53,424
Or did you just really want to help them be exposed to what homophobia could be and what it means?

316
00:23:56,532 --> 00:24:01,339
I'm not sure I understood the question, so if I don't answer correctly, please ask again.

317
00:24:10,562 --> 00:24:13,405
No, please, just, could you ask again the end of the question?

318
00:24:13,405 --> 00:24:14,807
No worries.

319
00:24:14,807 --> 00:24:22,074
So, a lot of times when you're wanting to change behavior of people, especially like

320
00:24:22,074 --> 00:24:26,960
in the case of like abusive relationships, a lot of times people will know that

321
00:24:27,613 --> 00:24:31,397
hey, this isn't a good thing, and sometimes it's hard to identify.

322
00:24:31,397 --> 00:24:34,419
But that doesn't necessarily change their behavior,

323
00:24:34,419 --> 00:24:36,822
and that's certainly a very complex, difficult challenge.

324
00:24:36,822 --> 00:24:41,045
So I was just wondering if you tried to address that in the game,

325
00:24:41,045 --> 00:24:43,608
and if so, how did you approach that?

326
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:46,130
Okay, so now I understand it's a very interesting question.

327
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:53,781
On another Lost from Loa story, one of the first questions we were asking ourselves is

328
00:24:53,781 --> 00:24:55,041
why do we do this game?

329
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,462
What impact do we want to have?

330
00:24:57,462 --> 00:25:04,744
And we were thinking on are we making a game for the victims?

331
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:08,725
Are we making a game for the abusers?

332
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:15,743
And when we talked with the organizations that help victims,

333
00:25:15,743 --> 00:25:20,264
we realized that it was more interesting to try

334
00:25:20,264 --> 00:25:22,145
to make a game for the people who

335
00:25:22,145 --> 00:25:25,886
might know other people who are in abusive relationships,

336
00:25:25,886 --> 00:25:28,447
in order to teach them how to react.

337
00:25:28,447 --> 00:25:33,629
Because that's the majority of the people.

338
00:25:35,502 --> 00:25:41,888
Maybe some people here are in an abusive relationship, and I'm sorry for that, but that would be

339
00:25:41,888 --> 00:25:43,110
a small portion of it.

340
00:25:43,110 --> 00:25:49,416
But I guess all of you, you know someone, or maybe you don't realize it, who is in this

341
00:25:49,416 --> 00:25:49,777
position.

342
00:25:49,777 --> 00:25:58,005
So that was the goal, trying to teach people to spot abusive relationships.

343
00:26:00,017 --> 00:26:06,659
give the right advice, understand them better, understand how the cycle of violence works,

344
00:26:06,659 --> 00:26:10,601
remind them that there are organizations that can help with this kind of stuff.

345
00:26:10,601 --> 00:26:11,521
All right, thank you so much.

346
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:12,181
Any other questions?

347
00:26:12,181 --> 00:26:12,822
Hi, thanks for the talk.

348
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:28,947
I was just wondering, you said that one of the things that you were focusing on was allowing

349
00:26:28,947 --> 00:26:35,372
people to make choices from perspectives that you didn't necessarily agree in or agree with

350
00:26:35,372 --> 00:26:39,535
in the game, so kind of honouring the alternate perspective from what you're trying to teach.

351
00:26:39,535 --> 00:26:44,500
I was just wondering if you could say a little bit more about that, like how do you kind

352
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:49,283
of encompass a divergent view from the message that you're trying to get, like how do people

353
00:26:49,283 --> 00:26:52,146
that are making those choices kind of learn from the game?

354
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:58,250
I'm sorry, I'm still not sure I understood the question.

355
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:02,393
Sorry, I thought that in your talk you were saying that you

356
00:27:02,393 --> 00:27:07,156
allowed players to play the game from different

357
00:27:07,156 --> 00:27:09,818
perspectives, so there might be people that were making

358
00:27:09,818 --> 00:27:12,380
choices that you wouldn't necessarily agree with.

359
00:27:12,380 --> 00:27:13,721
No, we don't do that.

360
00:27:13,721 --> 00:27:16,563
That's the opposite of what we're doing.

361
00:27:16,563 --> 00:27:19,965
We're making a game where the player has no choices to make.

362
00:27:20,659 --> 00:27:21,764
Oh, I'm sorry.

363
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:22,607
I misunderstood.

364
00:27:22,607 --> 00:27:23,048
Sorry.

365
00:27:23,048 --> 00:27:23,329
Sorry.

366
00:27:31,095 --> 00:27:36,118
Hi, my name is Daniela and I'm studying game development

367
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:40,120
and I have like a very interesting project.

368
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:43,241
I'm from Mexico and there's a lot of like corruption there.

369
00:27:43,241 --> 00:27:46,543
So my project was about corruption and it was really hard

370
00:27:46,543 --> 00:27:49,805
because like you said, you can't force a player

371
00:27:49,805 --> 00:27:54,487
to see like your perspective and agree with it.

372
00:27:54,487 --> 00:27:56,548
But where do you cross like,

373
00:27:56,548 --> 00:27:58,969
no, where do you draw the line, you know,

374
00:27:58,969 --> 00:27:59,470
because.

375
00:28:00,194 --> 00:28:09,220
I wanted to make the players feel the way, like, let me think about it, like when you're

376
00:28:09,220 --> 00:28:14,964
in disadvantage with someone because of the corruption and the abuse of power and stuff,

377
00:28:14,964 --> 00:28:25,712
but like, for example, we had to like force the players into that perspective, but because

378
00:28:25,712 --> 00:28:26,632
without...

379
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:32,367
giving up without we giving them that like character,

380
00:28:32,367 --> 00:28:35,029
they couldn't like see the issue, you know?

381
00:28:35,029 --> 00:28:39,472
And I think there was an issue with the game because of that

382
00:28:39,472 --> 00:28:43,455
because players didn't connect really with the character,

383
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:47,378
but like where do you draw the line between

384
00:28:47,378 --> 00:28:54,544
like giving the perspective you want the players to see

385
00:28:54,544 --> 00:28:55,625
and...

386
00:28:55,996 --> 00:28:58,633
giving them the freedom to really connect with the game.

387
00:29:01,032 --> 00:29:11,394
I think the answer would be playtest in order to find this line and also maybe use warnings

388
00:29:11,394 --> 00:29:16,315
at the beginning of your game, content warnings, tariqa warnings.

389
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:17,015
I'm not sure if that helps.

390
00:29:17,015 --> 00:29:17,615
Yeah.

391
00:29:17,615 --> 00:29:26,397
I have time maybe for one last question and after that if people want to keep asking questions

392
00:29:26,397 --> 00:29:29,478
we will do it inside because we have to clear the room for other people.

393
00:29:30,972 --> 00:29:32,574
Cool, my name is Gabriel Adauto.

394
00:29:32,574 --> 00:29:35,156
I make learning games for kids.

395
00:29:35,156 --> 00:29:38,879
My question is about the mechanics that you use.

396
00:29:38,879 --> 00:29:41,282
So you said in the initial game, you

397
00:29:41,282 --> 00:29:46,807
didn't want to do the sending the drafts.

398
00:29:46,807 --> 00:29:49,589
If you could just talk through a couple of categories

399
00:29:49,589 --> 00:29:52,912
of mechanics that you used in the game to replace that,

400
00:29:52,912 --> 00:29:55,175
or just how do we think about mechanics

401
00:29:55,175 --> 00:29:56,616
in this style of game?

402
00:29:57,175 --> 00:30:06,103
Okay, well the idea behind signing the draft was to be sure that the players have access

403
00:30:06,103 --> 00:30:10,867
to different parts of the game at different moments.

404
00:30:10,867 --> 00:30:16,352
It was inspired by a friend of us who had a bad experience with the game Her Story,

405
00:30:16,352 --> 00:30:21,997
where they got to the end at the first minute and they didn't enjoy it.

406
00:30:21,997 --> 00:30:24,679
So we wanted to have a system so that you

407
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:30,724
Even if you feel like you can read everything, in reality you have to read that part first

408
00:30:30,724 --> 00:30:35,188
and do something about it and then you can access the rest of it.

409
00:30:39,292 --> 00:30:42,874
The answer draft looks like a good idea at the time.

410
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:45,956
And what we did in the second game is instead

411
00:30:45,956 --> 00:30:50,079
having more password protected apart.

412
00:30:50,079 --> 00:30:54,242
And these passwords,

413
00:30:54,242 --> 00:30:58,084
they were always,

414
00:30:58,084 --> 00:31:00,286
you always had to have some information

415
00:31:00,286 --> 00:31:04,068
that you have read somewhere else to find the password.

416
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:06,290
So that's how we did it.

417
00:31:08,758 --> 00:31:11,406
Well, thanks a lot.
