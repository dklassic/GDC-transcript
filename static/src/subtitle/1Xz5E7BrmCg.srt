1
00:00:05,513 --> 00:00:10,655
So my name is David, and I made a indie game with a very

2
00:00:10,695 --> 00:00:13,396
talented team, and I'd like to talk about that.

3
00:00:15,696 --> 00:00:18,878
Probably some of you haven't played it yet, so the easiest

4
00:00:18,918 --> 00:00:22,059
way to describe Six Ages is it's a King of

5
00:00:22,119 --> 00:00:22,999
Dragon Pass-like.

6
00:00:23,933 --> 00:00:26,915
in the true style of games referencing other games.

7
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:30,658
But this is a genre of probably only two games.

8
00:00:31,238 --> 00:00:34,380
So I'd like to talk about what makes Six Ages unique,

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:37,222
and by extension, what made King of Dragons Pass unique.

10
00:00:39,427 --> 00:00:45,653
So some people say that the game is sort of a cross between a choose your own adventure

11
00:00:45,874 --> 00:00:51,959
and civilization, and really neither of those is true. On the other hand, I don't think

12
00:00:52,340 --> 00:00:58,346
Touch Arcade is completely wrong. It does combine narrative and a turn-based economic

13
00:00:58,386 --> 00:01:02,790
game, but it's trying to do things that neither genre alone can do.

14
00:01:04,973 --> 00:01:07,635
The shortest description of the games I've seen is,

15
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,356
it's a strategy book.

16
00:01:09,536 --> 00:01:10,816
This is what one of the players said.

17
00:01:13,498 --> 00:01:16,440
So the game is, in fact, a combination

18
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,421
of strategy and book.

19
00:01:17,801 --> 00:01:20,983
You're guiding a small clan of the Rider people, rather than

20
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:23,764
any one individual, or even a group of heroes.

21
00:01:24,665 --> 00:01:27,687
Your clan recently migrated because during the Gods War,

22
00:01:27,867 --> 00:01:29,908
your city got buried under a glacier.

23
00:01:31,497 --> 00:01:36,141
The core loop of the game is to take actions, which are sort of the turn-based strategy

24
00:01:36,501 --> 00:01:36,901
side.

25
00:01:37,622 --> 00:01:42,806
For example, a venture there, like expanding your fields.

26
00:01:42,826 --> 00:01:51,773
As these actions take time to do, events will occur and you respond to the events.

27
00:01:52,734 --> 00:01:57,117
So the strategy game is sort of a skeleton on which we can add stories.

28
00:01:59,206 --> 00:02:02,908
So that's sort of what it is, and I'm going to talk about how it works.

29
00:02:05,150 --> 00:02:07,731
Unlike civilization, it's all about cows.

30
00:02:09,232 --> 00:02:12,354
We actually do track a few more economic variables,

31
00:02:13,475 --> 00:02:16,297
but really it's all about relationships.

32
00:02:17,198 --> 00:02:20,059
Your clan's relationships with the neighboring clans

33
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,741
is as important as any economic resources.

34
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:29,595
You can go to war, but unlike civilization, you definitely cannot conquer all your neighbors.

35
00:02:31,056 --> 00:02:36,680
What you do instead is influence your relations with them, for example, by sending an emissary

36
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:41,464
with a dialogue there, and equally importantly, with story decisions.

37
00:02:43,225 --> 00:02:46,627
The game tracks a lot of different relationships between clans.

38
00:02:47,728 --> 00:02:52,011
One of the key things, I think, is that favors are one of the currencies of the game.

39
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:59,291
So as a book, there are over 400 interactive scenes.

40
00:02:59,351 --> 00:03:00,652
There's three of them shown there.

41
00:03:00,672 --> 00:03:04,776
The scenes usually have four or five responses.

42
00:03:06,477 --> 00:03:08,039
It's not choose your own adventure, though.

43
00:03:08,059 --> 00:03:10,841
In the interactive fiction lingo,

44
00:03:11,141 --> 00:03:14,264
it's probably a floating module.

45
00:03:15,565 --> 00:03:19,068
There is no single line that goes through the entire story.

46
00:03:20,809 --> 00:03:23,391
But these floating modules do connect.

47
00:03:24,550 --> 00:03:26,971
largely through the political and economic model

48
00:03:28,291 --> 00:03:29,091
and we'll also

49
00:03:29,772 --> 00:03:31,092
try to have as much intention

50
00:03:31,832 --> 00:03:34,313
to these as we can. For example, we might choose

51
00:03:34,333 --> 00:03:38,735
a particular clan to intensify the stakes of a situation.

52
00:03:40,975 --> 00:03:45,817
These scenes can also end up with multi-year storylines.

53
00:03:46,897 --> 00:03:50,538
For example, you may have a chance to see those rootless riders in the center

54
00:03:50,599 --> 00:03:51,899
again, depending on how you treat them.

55
00:03:54,884 --> 00:04:01,912
And we try to draw the entire story to a dramatic and emotionally satisfying conclusion.

56
00:04:04,215 --> 00:04:10,402
So the game has about as many words as the first four Harry Potter novels, but not all

57
00:04:10,443 --> 00:04:10,963
in a row.

58
00:04:11,964 --> 00:04:15,168
It's got a lot of repeatability and there's a lot of variation.

59
00:04:18,357 --> 00:04:21,198
We set the story in the world of Glorantha.

60
00:04:21,378 --> 00:04:24,779
This is a extremely detailed and realistic world,

61
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:27,360
and it helps us have an immersive background.

62
00:04:27,380 --> 00:04:30,201
You can sort of think of it almost like a character

63
00:04:30,241 --> 00:04:33,582
in the story, like Hogwarts is in the Harry Potter stories.

64
00:04:34,962 --> 00:04:39,363
Glorantha is a complete world with a mythology and cultures.

65
00:04:39,523 --> 00:04:41,484
It's sort of as if our background was already

66
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:42,224
play-tested.

67
00:04:43,224 --> 00:04:44,745
And the late Greg Stafford began writing

68
00:04:44,785 --> 00:04:46,465
about Glorantha over 50 years ago.

69
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,221
I'm picturing there the 800-page guide to Glorantha,

70
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:54,202
which is over 6.3 kilograms of information,

71
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,722
or 14 pounds if you're American.

72
00:04:56,602 --> 00:04:59,623
But we actually sort of play in the spaces between that,

73
00:05:00,263 --> 00:05:02,783
extrapolating from kind of just a few paragraphs in that.

74
00:05:05,564 --> 00:05:09,045
The setting gives us the main conflict in the game,

75
00:05:09,105 --> 00:05:11,885
which is that the main god of your neighbors

76
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,005
killed your main god,

77
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:15,346
and that's what set in place your migration.

78
00:05:16,663 --> 00:05:20,767
It also gives us a pantheon of deities, which provide magic.

79
00:05:21,047 --> 00:05:25,730
This impacts the economic model, including combat.

80
00:05:27,191 --> 00:05:30,073
But we try to make magic more than just sort of something

81
00:05:30,134 --> 00:05:30,674
mechanical.

82
00:05:30,754 --> 00:05:33,356
It's not always going to be, well, you get plus 2 in combat.

83
00:05:33,396 --> 00:05:35,938
We try to make it feel like magic.

84
00:05:36,058 --> 00:05:38,099
And that means it needs to have a much fuzzier feel.

85
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:47,298
One of the best examples of that is that we have the ability to let the player enter the

86
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:53,164
world of mythology, cross over to the other side, and play through a myth.

87
00:05:54,165 --> 00:05:56,728
They reenact the stories of the god, and they get magic.

88
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,751
And the outcome of this is usually quite fuzzy.

89
00:05:59,771 --> 00:06:01,933
You're basically making your own story.

90
00:06:02,873 --> 00:06:06,714
And if you've actually played King of Dragon Pass, these are

91
00:06:06,734 --> 00:06:09,555
sort of the myths that you know from the King of Dragon

92
00:06:09,575 --> 00:06:10,855
Pass days well in the future.

93
00:06:13,256 --> 00:06:15,956
The goal of all of this is to make an immersive experience.

94
00:06:16,817 --> 00:06:19,477
Sort of the summary of this is I want you to be playing the

95
00:06:19,557 --> 00:06:21,018
story, not the game.

96
00:06:21,898 --> 00:06:24,218
And just a quick reminder that just because it's largely

97
00:06:24,258 --> 00:06:27,059
text-based does not mean it's not immersive.

98
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:36,599
Our approach to immersion is that we try to make the player know what someone in the world

99
00:06:36,659 --> 00:06:39,840
knows and not have gamey things intrude on that.

100
00:06:41,101 --> 00:06:45,202
One of the things we have to do is introduce you to what you would know if you're in the

101
00:06:45,242 --> 00:06:45,542
world.

102
00:06:46,343 --> 00:06:52,605
And we start off with a clan questionnaire, which helps introduce the history of your

103
00:06:52,665 --> 00:06:52,965
clan.

104
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:57,734
It's not a show, don't tell, but it's a do, don't show.

105
00:06:58,635 --> 00:07:00,476
So we can avoid an expository lump.

106
00:07:00,796 --> 00:07:03,878
And this also makes your clan's back story the

107
00:07:03,918 --> 00:07:04,779
player's back story.

108
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:08,481
It's sort of like character creation in a lot of games.

109
00:07:09,341 --> 00:07:12,603
And it does not only initialize the story situations

110
00:07:12,643 --> 00:07:15,745
you're putting your clan into, but some of the economic model

111
00:07:15,805 --> 00:07:16,105
as well.

112
00:07:19,035 --> 00:07:24,357
The problem is that the players are probably not members of the writer culture and we don't

113
00:07:24,377 --> 00:07:28,079
want to penalize them because they don't know as much as someone in the world would know.

114
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,380
So the solution is to have advisors.

115
00:07:33,121 --> 00:07:37,342
These are leaders that will basically have three roles in the game.

116
00:07:38,343 --> 00:07:39,603
They'll provide information.

117
00:07:40,204 --> 00:07:41,884
They also act as your playing pieces.

118
00:07:42,825 --> 00:07:47,327
And they have their own personalities and become sympathetic characters, which helps

119
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:48,307
enhance immersion.

120
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:54,306
Because the advisors are so key, the player gets to choose them from a pool of leaders.

121
00:07:56,328 --> 00:08:01,714
So advisors will give in-world information about, like, the state of the economy and

122
00:08:01,734 --> 00:08:02,495
the relationships.

123
00:08:04,137 --> 00:08:09,123
They'll recommend actions, and they'll also remind you to do things that you would do

124
00:08:09,223 --> 00:08:10,684
if you're running a clan.

125
00:08:14,617 --> 00:08:20,182
As the game progresses, your advisors will get older and eventually die of old age.

126
00:08:22,645 --> 00:08:28,871
They have skills which are used to overcome obstacles and also relate to the kind of advice

127
00:08:28,931 --> 00:08:29,311
you give.

128
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:33,355
For example here, Ave 2 is heroic and magic, so...

129
00:08:34,462 --> 00:08:39,062
She would probably be someone to listen to if she's talking about magic, but if she's

130
00:08:39,102 --> 00:08:43,443
talking about a diplomatic situation where she has only a fair skill, you might want

131
00:08:43,463 --> 00:08:45,123
to listen to one of your other advisors.

132
00:08:47,684 --> 00:08:49,604
Advisors all have personalities.

133
00:08:51,184 --> 00:08:55,445
We – and their advice, as you can see, can sometimes reflect that personality.

134
00:08:56,245 --> 00:09:01,106
We do try to prioritize skill-based advice on the assumption that that's what the player

135
00:09:01,186 --> 00:09:03,027
needs in order to succeed.

136
00:09:09,069 --> 00:09:12,533
So to give advisors personalities, there's 33

137
00:09:13,094 --> 00:09:14,575
personality traits in the game.

138
00:09:15,997 --> 00:09:18,340
They are randomly generated.

139
00:09:19,902 --> 00:09:22,965
Every advisor has only two personality traits, which is

140
00:09:23,005 --> 00:09:25,228
kind of pretty limiting for humans.

141
00:09:25,288 --> 00:09:27,811
But we want to make sure that over the course of the game,

142
00:09:28,351 --> 00:09:29,613
they can be noticed by a player.

143
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:35,964
Some of the traits are contradictory, so we make sure that when we randomly generate them,

144
00:09:36,324 --> 00:09:38,446
a character gets only something that makes sense.

145
00:09:38,566 --> 00:09:43,951
You can't be both optimistic and pessimistic, at least not within the scope of this simulation.

146
00:09:45,152 --> 00:09:51,878
And while a character's religion is not actually a personality trait, that also fits into the

147
00:09:52,278 --> 00:09:53,339
valid combinations.

148
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:58,243
If you worship the war god, you're not going to have a personality trait of peaceful.

149
00:10:00,622 --> 00:10:03,583
So why do we have personality in the game?

150
00:10:03,703 --> 00:10:06,564
Well, as I mentioned before, it drives advice.

151
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:09,345
But more importantly, it'll drive action.

152
00:10:10,245 --> 00:10:13,446
Your advisors are people with their own personalities and

153
00:10:13,486 --> 00:10:14,266
their own agendas.

154
00:10:15,167 --> 00:10:17,287
And they'll go off and do things on their own without

155
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,388
you asking them or even wanting them to.

156
00:10:20,808 --> 00:10:25,210
So we try to be fair to the player and only have something

157
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,551
like this happen after you had a chance to witness their

158
00:10:28,571 --> 00:10:29,211
personality.

159
00:10:30,282 --> 00:10:33,965
And if it's visible at the bottom, you can see a little bit of script that a character

160
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:40,630
has to be on the clan council for at least two years before this scene will show up where

161
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,434
the goat fan starts inviting people in and you, the player, have to deal with the situation.

162
00:10:47,376 --> 00:10:49,537
Personality can also be a positive thing.

163
00:10:49,557 --> 00:10:52,359
It can be a modifier in many situations.

164
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:58,264
Or you wouldn't send a merciful character or a peaceful character off to intimidate

165
00:10:58,304 --> 00:10:58,764
someone else.

166
00:11:00,205 --> 00:11:01,526
you might send your harsh character.

167
00:11:05,389 --> 00:11:09,553
So advisors being people sometimes have conflicts with each other.

168
00:11:09,573 --> 00:11:15,619
The situation here, one of your advisors has told the buzzard people they should try harder

169
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,724
to fit in, and another one is reminding him that the correct term is not buzzard people

170
00:11:21,784 --> 00:11:22,525
but adoptees.

171
00:11:23,799 --> 00:11:26,420
I think in the game, some of the best writing is in advice.

172
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:30,482
And that's probably because it allows us to have a viewpoint

173
00:11:31,322 --> 00:11:33,603
instead of just presenting facts, like we

174
00:11:33,623 --> 00:11:34,923
have 12 cows less.

175
00:11:38,385 --> 00:11:41,786
So let's look behind the scene at how strategy and

176
00:11:41,846 --> 00:11:42,826
story work together.

177
00:11:44,431 --> 00:11:47,712
We have our own domain-specific language.

178
00:11:48,393 --> 00:11:49,873
I called it the Opal Scripting Language,

179
00:11:49,973 --> 00:11:52,054
after an old code name for King of Dragon Pass.

180
00:11:52,834 --> 00:11:54,215
It's a domain-specific language,

181
00:11:54,295 --> 00:11:56,856
and it was kind of designed around something

182
00:11:56,876 --> 00:11:59,797
that would be easy for our writer to use.

183
00:12:02,698 --> 00:12:05,339
At the top there is a conditional response.

184
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:10,423
This condition depends on several functions.

185
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:14,006
We generate a list of clans, and then we filter it to see

186
00:12:14,166 --> 00:12:16,588
if we have any clans that are not feuding, because this

187
00:12:16,649 --> 00:12:20,112
response wouldn't make any sense if we don't have anyone

188
00:12:20,132 --> 00:12:21,013
we could trade it to.

189
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:25,617
As the script executes, the first thing that happens is a

190
00:12:25,657 --> 00:12:26,738
choose clan function.

191
00:12:27,359 --> 00:12:29,601
And that just puts up user interface where the player

192
00:12:29,701 --> 00:12:30,882
gets to choose a clan.

193
00:12:32,882 --> 00:12:39,804
Once they do that, we start doing things like looking at the relationship with that clan

194
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:43,624
that the player picked and calculating a modifier.

195
00:12:45,345 --> 00:12:51,406
There's also modifiers based on your own allocation of clan magic and just as a shorthand where

196
00:12:51,446 --> 00:12:54,766
it says .ritualmagic, that's our clan, .ritualmagic.

197
00:12:55,046 --> 00:12:57,127
This makes it a little easier for us to read.

198
00:13:00,067 --> 00:13:01,408
And, whoa, that's too fast.

199
00:13:04,198 --> 00:13:08,340
Once they have chosen and we calculate the bonuses,

200
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:11,521
there's the test, which I was talking about earlier.

201
00:13:11,701 --> 00:13:14,182
This is going to take whoever on your clan council

202
00:13:14,582 --> 00:13:18,504
has the best bargaining skill and challenge them

203
00:13:18,984 --> 00:13:20,825
to make a bargaining roll, basically.

204
00:13:21,545 --> 00:13:23,126
And this has two possible outcomes.

205
00:13:23,166 --> 00:13:24,046
They could win or lose.

206
00:13:24,974 --> 00:13:28,775
And we also set a degree of success.

207
00:13:28,855 --> 00:13:31,436
It's by convention the variable Q, which lets us have

208
00:13:31,456 --> 00:13:35,257
like really terrible failures or marginal successes.

209
00:13:35,317 --> 00:13:37,558
And I think this one here is a marginal success.

210
00:13:38,238 --> 00:13:40,479
They get a handsome price, but it's the smallest possible

211
00:13:40,539 --> 00:13:41,179
handsome price.

212
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:48,467
So the scenes are our major building block

213
00:13:48,627 --> 00:13:49,848
of procedural content.

214
00:13:50,308 --> 00:13:52,389
There's also some other types of scripts.

215
00:13:53,009 --> 00:13:54,971
For example, news can also be interactive,

216
00:13:55,011 --> 00:13:56,211
but it's not illustrating.

217
00:13:56,231 --> 00:13:57,512
It doesn't have advice.

218
00:14:00,234 --> 00:14:02,415
Scenes in general can have conditions on them.

219
00:14:02,835 --> 00:14:05,957
This one occurs only if a variable is set to true.

220
00:14:05,977 --> 00:14:11,460
A lot of the time, a scene is a consequence of something else.

221
00:14:13,505 --> 00:14:14,946
Oops, I skipped ahead.

222
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:18,310
Things can happen when conditions occur.

223
00:14:19,070 --> 00:14:23,094
This one's checking if a variable has changed value and

224
00:14:23,114 --> 00:14:24,376
can do appropriate things.

225
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,902
Scenes are often consequences.

226
00:14:28,502 --> 00:14:30,744
Here we're triggering another scene three seasons

227
00:14:31,285 --> 00:14:32,085
after right now.

228
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:37,410
And this is also one of the ways we get those longer story

229
00:14:37,510 --> 00:14:39,111
arcs will trigger scenes that will happen

230
00:14:39,132 --> 00:14:40,092
in a couple of years.

231
00:14:40,853 --> 00:14:43,996
It also lets us have bonuses that will expire after a

232
00:14:44,036 --> 00:14:44,736
certain time limit.

233
00:14:47,841 --> 00:14:51,044
One difference between Six Ages and a lot of games is that

234
00:14:51,284 --> 00:14:52,946
we'll only show relevant items.

235
00:14:53,286 --> 00:14:56,369
And that's because you're someone in the world, and you

236
00:14:56,389 --> 00:14:57,631
don't really know what might have been.

237
00:14:57,651 --> 00:15:00,353
If only you had more clan magic, you could have drawn

238
00:15:00,393 --> 00:15:03,276
on it, but it's not something you would even consider.

239
00:15:03,296 --> 00:15:06,739
There's no might, what might have been.

240
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:13,864
The scenes are managed in a scene queue, which is a priority queue.

241
00:15:14,485 --> 00:15:17,447
The granularity is a turn, because we're a turn-based strategy game.

242
00:15:18,487 --> 00:15:24,612
And this is basically how we can add time to the narrative and handle those long storylines.

243
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:35,192
Because something may change once you've triggered

244
00:15:35,212 --> 00:15:37,613
something in the future, the character that it relates to

245
00:15:37,653 --> 00:15:40,834
may die, so you will have the ability to pull scenes out of

246
00:15:40,854 --> 00:15:41,214
the queue.

247
00:15:44,755 --> 00:15:47,315
Generally, we look at what's in the queue and run it.

248
00:15:47,636 --> 00:15:50,216
But if there's nothing right now in the queue and it's time

249
00:15:50,276 --> 00:15:53,597
to run a scene, we will pick a scene basically at random.

250
00:15:54,562 --> 00:16:01,708
These unscripted scenes are how the emergent narrative comes into play.

251
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:11,537
Most scenes in the game are unscripted, but, which doesn't mean they're truly random.

252
00:16:11,557 --> 00:16:12,798
There's always conditions on them.

253
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:18,824
We don't pick a scene that's already scheduled to run in the future, because that would start

254
00:16:19,184 --> 00:16:20,925
making unnecessary repeats.

255
00:16:21,744 --> 00:16:25,206
On the other hand, we do have the capability of repeating scenes.

256
00:16:26,906 --> 00:16:28,667
Not every scene makes sense to repeat.

257
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:31,909
And even if they do, we try to keep a scene from happening.

258
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:34,290
I think it's nine years, nine game years,

259
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,870
between a repeat of a scene.

260
00:16:36,751 --> 00:16:38,811
Otherwise it would start feeling, well, repetitive.

261
00:16:41,407 --> 00:16:43,788
Scenes can have conditions because they don't make sense,

262
00:16:44,268 --> 00:16:45,869
either maybe in a certain time of the year.

263
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:47,750
It doesn't make sense to have something

264
00:16:47,770 --> 00:16:51,692
that's not related to crops unless it is crop season.

265
00:16:52,392 --> 00:16:53,753
Doesn't make sense to have someone

266
00:16:54,393 --> 00:16:57,194
offer to sell you something if you couldn't afford to buy it.

267
00:16:57,895 --> 00:16:59,115
And some things just don't make sense

268
00:16:59,155 --> 00:17:00,456
until you've played for a while.

269
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:07,548
So one of the goals of the game is to have a very high

270
00:17:07,588 --> 00:17:08,349
replayability.

271
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,952
And procedural content is a great answer for that.

272
00:17:14,793 --> 00:17:18,096
You really don't know what to expect between games, because

273
00:17:18,416 --> 00:17:19,717
scenes repeat only rarely.

274
00:17:19,737 --> 00:17:21,478
You don't get the same set every game.

275
00:17:24,501 --> 00:17:26,582
The text itself is also procedural.

276
00:17:26,922 --> 00:17:30,705
And we have what I would categorize into two forms of

277
00:17:30,825 --> 00:17:31,466
placeholders.

278
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:36,227
The alternatives are just a way to keep the text

279
00:17:36,767 --> 00:17:37,548
different each time.

280
00:17:37,648 --> 00:17:41,092
For example, here you could be getting a gift of cedar wood

281
00:17:41,332 --> 00:17:42,253
or yellow dye.

282
00:17:44,155 --> 00:17:46,978
And contextual placeholders are filled in with the value

283
00:17:47,078 --> 00:17:47,759
of a variable.

284
00:17:48,540 --> 00:17:52,043
In this case, other clan is whoever it is that came to you

285
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:52,904
offering this gift.

286
00:17:53,808 --> 00:17:56,630
The value of it is g, and the tilde there just means

287
00:17:57,111 --> 00:17:59,333
this is something that's worth spelling out as

288
00:18:00,033 --> 00:18:03,576
the word, like, t-w-o, two, and

289
00:18:04,377 --> 00:18:07,380
either cow or cows, to make it grammatically correct,

290
00:18:07,420 --> 00:18:09,221
depending on the number that's being offered.

291
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,737
It's not just these contextual placeholders.

292
00:18:13,777 --> 00:18:16,399
Pretty much everything in the game is contextual.

293
00:18:17,079 --> 00:18:19,962
If a clan is coming to give you gifts, it matters an

294
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:23,745
awful lot whether that's a clan that you might have an

295
00:18:23,825 --> 00:18:26,587
alliance with, or if it's a clan that's feuding with you.

296
00:18:27,548 --> 00:18:32,151
So we really are leveraging humans' ability to extract

297
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:36,795
patterns from things that may not officially be related and

298
00:18:37,495 --> 00:18:39,857
find the relationship between them, which is apophenia.

299
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:48,106
So I may have skimmed by the fact that there's a lot of

300
00:18:48,186 --> 00:18:49,267
tags in the game.

301
00:18:50,247 --> 00:18:52,989
These are a way that we can help categorize the scenes,

302
00:18:53,329 --> 00:18:57,131
and that helps integrate the story in the economic model.

303
00:18:58,492 --> 00:19:02,774
I told our author to make up tags as needed, and we ended

304
00:19:02,794 --> 00:19:04,075
up with 135 different tags.

305
00:19:05,475 --> 00:19:06,816
These are all attached to scripts.

306
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:09,958
The at sign just makes it stand out.

307
00:19:11,632 --> 00:19:14,873
And there's sort of a way to solve the problem, what scenes

308
00:19:15,093 --> 00:19:19,194
should be affected by a bonus?

309
00:19:19,214 --> 00:19:24,716
So if you have done something where the spirits are going to

310
00:19:24,756 --> 00:19:27,397
give you good luck with animals, we need to know what

311
00:19:27,477 --> 00:19:29,598
scenes relate in some way to animals.

312
00:19:29,658 --> 00:19:32,158
So we tag them with the animals tag.

313
00:19:33,339 --> 00:19:38,260
At the same time, a tag may not apply to an entire scene.

314
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,261
It may apply only to a specific response.

315
00:19:41,216 --> 00:19:44,738
You may have the choice to either rely on the gods or rely on spirits.

316
00:19:45,319 --> 00:19:50,242
And if you chose the spirit branch, then we'll add the spirits tag, and that makes sure that

317
00:19:51,003 --> 00:19:53,004
the appropriate bonuses will apply.

318
00:19:55,285 --> 00:20:00,129
And some tags ended up just being informational, just to look at a scene and say, oh, this

319
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,630
scene relates to Act 3.

320
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:05,712
We have an act structure loosely, but it's not enforced by anything.

321
00:20:05,732 --> 00:20:07,934
There's no code that checks that particular one.

322
00:20:14,865 --> 00:20:19,427
So one of the challenges in making an economic model

323
00:20:19,627 --> 00:20:22,109
and a story that relate to each other

324
00:20:22,129 --> 00:20:25,870
is if there's a consequence, did you notice it?

325
00:20:27,031 --> 00:20:29,672
And we want to make sure that on the flip side,

326
00:20:29,732 --> 00:20:32,594
if the economy has a problem, is this something

327
00:20:32,614 --> 00:20:35,776
that we can have matter in the story explicitly?

328
00:20:37,276 --> 00:20:39,237
And the solution that we ended up with

329
00:20:39,918 --> 00:20:42,099
is something I'm calling concerns.

330
00:20:43,617 --> 00:20:47,198
Their purpose is to make problems in the economy very

331
00:20:47,258 --> 00:20:50,780
visible to the player and give us something that's an

332
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:54,882
interesting story decision when you have to deal with that.

333
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:59,765
They can actually either be something that's bad, which is

334
00:20:59,845 --> 00:21:02,566
a stress, or it can be something that's good, which

335
00:21:02,886 --> 00:21:03,647
we call a bounty.

336
00:21:05,788 --> 00:21:08,049
And they're always something that should be meaningful.

337
00:21:08,109 --> 00:21:11,431
It's not just going to be a little plus one that.

338
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,053
actually does make a big difference.

339
00:21:14,213 --> 00:21:16,234
If they keep playing the game for 30 game years,

340
00:21:16,274 --> 00:21:18,475
a plus one will accrue and be very significant.

341
00:21:19,296 --> 00:21:22,238
But that kind of thing is very hard for humans to perceive.

342
00:21:22,398 --> 00:21:24,079
So they're going to be big enough.

343
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:29,162
And an example here is when you have the chance

344
00:21:29,242 --> 00:21:33,664
to have your crafters make story tent fabric, that

345
00:21:33,684 --> 00:21:36,066
will end up distracting them from their other chores.

346
00:21:36,706 --> 00:21:39,128
And you'll get a craft stress.

347
00:21:41,158 --> 00:21:46,582
concern. This means you'll have a penalty on your craft productivity for, in this case,

348
00:21:46,622 --> 00:21:52,165
five seasons. These concerns are cumulative. You can actually cancel this out if you've

349
00:21:52,185 --> 00:21:53,846
got a bounty in some way.

350
00:21:57,989 --> 00:22:03,593
The concern idea actually originally came from the fact that we wanted to show the economy

351
00:22:04,073 --> 00:22:06,134
visibly to the player, and we ended up

352
00:22:07,226 --> 00:22:09,109
leveraging that into a larger thing of concerns.

353
00:22:09,210 --> 00:22:10,472
And they still do get shown.

354
00:22:10,953 --> 00:22:13,878
Concerns are all shown in the dashboard next to the menu

355
00:22:13,898 --> 00:22:14,259
buttons.

356
00:22:15,481 --> 00:22:17,504
And they're also something that your advisors will

357
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:18,546
typically comment on.

358
00:22:20,365 --> 00:22:23,047
Concerns are usually kind of an ongoing thing, like that

359
00:22:23,327 --> 00:22:26,808
five-season craft stress.

360
00:22:27,809 --> 00:22:31,190
But it turns out we have sort of shorter things that we

361
00:22:32,031 --> 00:22:34,352
leverage the concern system for, like a warning.

362
00:22:35,052 --> 00:22:37,433
If you're running short of warriors, that's not something

363
00:22:37,453 --> 00:22:39,034
that's an ongoing problem.

364
00:22:39,054 --> 00:22:40,794
It's just right now we're short of warriors.

365
00:22:41,435 --> 00:22:43,296
That's a warning, and we'll also show that in the

366
00:22:43,336 --> 00:22:45,837
dashboard, and of course, advisors will remind you that

367
00:22:45,857 --> 00:22:46,597
you're kind of getting low.

368
00:22:50,605 --> 00:22:54,067
Unlike a lot of games, you don't actually have to worry

369
00:22:54,187 --> 00:22:55,708
about telling your people what to do.

370
00:22:56,148 --> 00:23:00,250
We assume that an agrarian clan knows how to feed itself.

371
00:23:00,910 --> 00:23:02,531
At the same time, there still can be problems

372
00:23:02,571 --> 00:23:03,412
that arise with that.

373
00:23:04,392 --> 00:23:06,953
But you don't need to worry about counting the beans,

374
00:23:07,333 --> 00:23:09,574
because it's actually really hard.

375
00:23:09,635 --> 00:23:12,136
Again, it's something that's hard to wrap your brain around,

376
00:23:12,156 --> 00:23:15,817
at least for us modern people, because food comes in mostly

377
00:23:15,837 --> 00:23:16,578
in harvest time.

378
00:23:18,141 --> 00:23:21,885
if you, even if you knew the exact amount of food that you had, you'd still have to

379
00:23:21,905 --> 00:23:26,450
sort of do mental calculations to compare it against the number of people and, but wait,

380
00:23:26,510 --> 00:23:30,054
this is the, this is the winter time and we don't, we're going to be not getting much

381
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:35,961
right. So it turns out having less information, that's sort of less transparent is way more

382
00:23:36,041 --> 00:23:38,844
useful and we show the number of seasons of food you have.

383
00:23:40,930 --> 00:23:43,291
Again, if this is problematic, we're going to let you know.

384
00:23:43,831 --> 00:23:46,832
But most of the time, you have a few seasons, it's far more

385
00:23:46,932 --> 00:23:49,953
useful than knowing that you have 1,000 bushels of food or

386
00:23:49,993 --> 00:23:50,334
something.

387
00:23:54,595 --> 00:23:55,676
Every game has to test.

388
00:23:55,736 --> 00:23:58,037
A few things that are different in a game like this

389
00:23:58,297 --> 00:24:00,918
is that we have a new form of logic error, which is problems

390
00:24:00,958 --> 00:24:01,558
in the story.

391
00:24:02,958 --> 00:24:04,879
Apophenia is a two-edged sword.

392
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:07,940
The players will expect patterns to be true when they

393
00:24:08,140 --> 00:24:09,100
may not be, in a way.

394
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:12,222
And the fact that everything is context sensitive makes

395
00:24:12,262 --> 00:24:14,262
that more of an issue.

396
00:24:15,583 --> 00:24:18,624
We may have a scene that runs just fine unless you happen to

397
00:24:18,684 --> 00:24:20,365
have an ally and you attack them.

398
00:24:20,445 --> 00:24:24,387
And if the game doesn't notice that you attacked an ally, the

399
00:24:24,427 --> 00:24:26,247
players suddenly no longer immerse.

400
00:24:26,287 --> 00:24:27,668
They think, oh, this is just code.

401
00:24:27,728 --> 00:24:29,409
This isn't a real story anymore.

402
00:24:31,669 --> 00:24:31,810
So.

403
00:24:33,535 --> 00:24:39,540
Our testing has to focus on the story problems, and as well

404
00:24:40,321 --> 00:24:42,963
the fact that everything, the context of a scene could be

405
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:44,365
very different every time it's run.

406
00:24:45,325 --> 00:24:49,549
And one way I try to make that easier for us to test is to do

407
00:24:49,569 --> 00:24:50,950
a lot of automated testing.

408
00:24:50,970 --> 00:24:55,394
I can run through every response of every scene and

409
00:24:55,414 --> 00:24:58,657
make sure that there's no gross errors, like crashing

410
00:24:58,817 --> 00:24:59,257
out or.

411
00:25:00,928 --> 00:25:03,489
ending up with a zero as a value when it shouldn't be.

412
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,031
And there's a bunch of sort of stress tests on that.

413
00:25:08,032 --> 00:25:10,114
If you have no goods at all, does the scene make sense?

414
00:25:11,214 --> 00:25:14,296
Exhaustive QA just means we go through every response of

415
00:25:14,356 --> 00:25:17,078
every scene and every branch, and possibly with different

416
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,839
variables set, and make sure that it

417
00:25:18,879 --> 00:25:20,320
makes sense as a story.

418
00:25:22,402 --> 00:25:23,843
Another thing QA did was to make.

419
00:25:25,196 --> 00:25:26,877
aware like what's not in the game.

420
00:25:26,937 --> 00:25:29,259
This is all testing the trees.

421
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,301
And we'd still need to know if the forest makes sense.

422
00:25:33,523 --> 00:25:36,525
Some of the challenges of my approach to showing you only

423
00:25:36,605 --> 00:25:40,008
in-world information is that it may not be as transparent as a

424
00:25:40,048 --> 00:25:40,588
lot of games.

425
00:25:41,609 --> 00:25:44,591
Difficulty is something that we try to mention with advice.

426
00:25:45,872 --> 00:25:48,314
Players of King of Dragon Pass often complain that they

427
00:25:48,354 --> 00:25:49,635
didn't know why something failed.

428
00:25:49,735 --> 00:25:50,636
So we've added the.

429
00:25:51,610 --> 00:25:54,973
Typically, an advisor will explain either how you could

430
00:25:54,993 --> 00:25:58,057
have done better next time or an explanation for why

431
00:25:58,117 --> 00:25:58,998
something didn't work.

432
00:26:01,921 --> 00:26:06,606
We also try to show as many consequences as possible in

433
00:26:06,806 --> 00:26:10,070
the dashboard or here in the magic screen lists all the

434
00:26:10,190 --> 00:26:11,932
weird little bonuses you might have accrued.

435
00:26:14,754 --> 00:26:17,995
And you can also lose immersion by stopping playing.

436
00:26:18,295 --> 00:26:22,436
And the game doesn't have arbitrary save points that you

437
00:26:22,456 --> 00:26:24,257
have recognizable places that you were.

438
00:26:24,277 --> 00:26:25,978
It saves automatically.

439
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:28,079
So you're picking up and where the hell was I?

440
00:26:28,819 --> 00:26:30,940
Advisors, again, will try to remind you of that.

441
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:35,141
And there's also a saga, which is automatic note taking,

442
00:26:35,581 --> 00:26:37,722
which you can refer to to see what you had been doing.

443
00:26:39,599 --> 00:26:42,202
And finally, the goal of the game has been kind of a problem.

444
00:26:42,322 --> 00:26:44,745
Unlike King of Dragon Pass, where the title is the goal,

445
00:26:45,566 --> 00:26:48,910
the goal is kind of behind a plot twist in this game.

446
00:26:48,930 --> 00:26:52,474
It would kind of be like telling you at the start, hey,

447
00:26:52,494 --> 00:26:54,336
little farmer, you're going to blow up the Death Star.

448
00:26:55,357 --> 00:26:56,459
And we can't really do that.

449
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:57,860
But.

450
00:27:01,567 --> 00:27:02,788
So I'm going to wrap up.

451
00:27:02,808 --> 00:27:07,569
And Six Ages is a game that really tries to balance both

452
00:27:08,450 --> 00:27:11,010
story and strategy as equal partners.

453
00:27:12,491 --> 00:27:15,192
We try to make a game where you're playing the story and

454
00:27:15,252 --> 00:27:15,792
not the game.

455
00:27:16,712 --> 00:27:19,573
One of the key ways that we get there is by having

456
00:27:20,313 --> 00:27:23,435
advisors who are empathetic characters.

457
00:27:25,135 --> 00:27:27,336
The overall story is multi-generational.

458
00:27:29,113 --> 00:27:32,296
Our procedural narrative exploits apophenia to get even

459
00:27:32,336 --> 00:27:35,058
more meaning out of our assemblage of scenes.

460
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,859
We try to do everything possible in

461
00:27:37,899 --> 00:27:38,880
our scripting language.

462
00:27:40,261 --> 00:27:43,243
And we have the concept of concerns, which are sort of a

463
00:27:43,543 --> 00:27:47,706
quantized unit that helps integrate the story and the

464
00:27:47,726 --> 00:27:48,367
strategy game.

465
00:27:50,748 --> 00:27:52,369
So what questions do you have?

466
00:27:52,509 --> 00:27:55,111
I think I have a few minutes left, about two or three.

467
00:27:56,752 --> 00:27:59,753
Please get up to the mics so people can hear you on the audio.

468
00:28:01,374 --> 00:28:01,634
Hi.

469
00:28:02,134 --> 00:28:03,014
Thanks for sharing all this.

470
00:28:03,715 --> 00:28:06,396
So you put a lot of effort into the replayability

471
00:28:06,436 --> 00:28:09,057
and the procedural narrative and the logic behind what

472
00:28:09,097 --> 00:28:10,117
could repeat and not repeat.

473
00:28:11,278 --> 00:28:13,179
But the game is kind of a long game.

474
00:28:13,199 --> 00:28:15,460
It sounds like you're literally playing through years and years.

475
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:19,001
How much was the return on investment for that?

476
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,642
Do people really enjoy replaying it?

477
00:28:22,563 --> 00:28:24,444
And was it worth the effort?

478
00:28:26,825 --> 00:28:31,007
So the King of Dragons Pass answer to that, because that

479
00:28:31,087 --> 00:28:36,009
came out a lot longer, is that it's insanely replayable, and

480
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:38,291
people have been playing it, the same person has been

481
00:28:38,311 --> 00:28:40,051
playing it for years in some cases.

482
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:45,554
A lot of it was more just so that you could lose the game

483
00:28:45,754 --> 00:28:48,256
and try again and see a somewhat different story.

484
00:28:49,416 --> 00:28:51,677
So I think it's been worth it just for that.

485
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,519
It's not a single story that you go through.

486
00:28:55,763 --> 00:28:59,466
People probably don't need to play it as many times as they did with King of the Dragon Pass, but

487
00:28:59,486 --> 00:29:01,488
I think it was worth it.

488
00:29:03,089 --> 00:29:04,330
If I can follow up the

489
00:29:04,350 --> 00:29:05,731
oh, was it lost?

490
00:29:06,692 --> 00:29:09,654
If somebody lost the game and they tried to recreate the same path,

491
00:29:10,115 --> 00:29:12,477
you know, except for the very end, is there enough random

492
00:29:13,417 --> 00:29:15,599
event in there that it would be different anyway?

493
00:29:15,659 --> 00:29:19,622
I think every game is going to be different. The overall

494
00:29:20,303 --> 00:29:22,464
goal of the game ends up being the same every time.

495
00:29:23,678 --> 00:29:26,121
Although you can get there, even that's got some variation.

496
00:29:26,642 --> 00:29:29,305
So winning is not always identical either.

497
00:29:29,325 --> 00:29:31,888
Thank you.

498
00:29:35,652 --> 00:29:36,273
Thanks for your talk.

499
00:29:36,767 --> 00:29:38,789
Um, regarding QA,

500
00:29:39,209 --> 00:29:41,471
I imagine it must have been a tremendous task.

501
00:29:41,531 --> 00:29:44,053
Is that something that the, uh,

502
00:29:44,253 --> 00:29:45,535
the engine or the scripting language

503
00:29:45,575 --> 00:29:47,796
that you guys developed helped you do,

504
00:29:47,876 --> 00:29:52,020
or was it just, you know, um, manpower that got through?

505
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:53,121
It was pretty much other...

506
00:29:53,141 --> 00:29:55,703
We did have the unit tests that automated a lot of that.

507
00:29:56,724 --> 00:29:58,125
The scripting language...

508
00:29:58,305 --> 00:30:01,407
The script compiler can find a small category of errors itself,

509
00:30:02,528 --> 00:30:03,729
and I would add more to that.

510
00:30:05,467 --> 00:30:08,230
one of the, it wasn't quite the language itself,

511
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:11,094
but a lot of errors ended up being something

512
00:30:11,114 --> 00:30:12,716
that would happen multiple places.

513
00:30:13,337 --> 00:30:15,399
So I would, we'd find an error,

514
00:30:15,459 --> 00:30:17,382
and then I would sweep for similar scripts

515
00:30:17,722 --> 00:30:19,444
and correct it before QA found it.

516
00:30:19,464 --> 00:30:22,088
Okay, thanks.

517
00:30:24,360 --> 00:30:26,182
You mentioned that despite the randomization,

518
00:30:26,222 --> 00:30:29,004
there's still a clear story arc to each play through.

519
00:30:30,244 --> 00:30:32,006
Do you have time to elaborate at all on that,

520
00:30:32,546 --> 00:30:33,567
on how you accomplished that?

521
00:30:33,687 --> 00:30:34,507
I don't think there is.

522
00:30:34,608 --> 00:30:39,091
Well, there's no single story arc that you'd ever get.

523
00:30:39,951 --> 00:30:42,813
There are some sort of tentpole scenes

524
00:30:43,314 --> 00:30:45,715
that we think you need to get to get the full experience.

525
00:30:46,556 --> 00:30:49,918
But those are never going to be exactly the same.

526
00:30:49,938 --> 00:30:53,461
The context is almost always going to be different for those.

527
00:30:54,912 --> 00:30:59,154
And you can certainly go through, even some of the, they're not tentpole scenes, but there's

528
00:30:59,174 --> 00:31:04,596
some significant smaller storylines that may never occur in any one play.

529
00:31:05,596 --> 00:31:11,759
So it's mostly that, you know, as in King of Dragon Pass, you're trying to end up being

530
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:16,300
King of Dragon Pass and your story's always going to be, always going to be at the end

531
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:20,242
becoming King of Dragon Pass, but the story along the way is very different.

532
00:31:21,306 --> 00:31:23,688
And these things will, random scenes, even the same scenes

533
00:31:23,708 --> 00:31:25,809
will come up in different orders and that the context

534
00:31:26,189 --> 00:31:27,350
makes it very, very different.

535
00:31:28,891 --> 00:31:29,231
Thank you.

536
00:31:34,235 --> 00:31:35,615
Okay, I guess we went over a little bit.

537
00:31:35,756 --> 00:31:38,017
Thanks for coming.
