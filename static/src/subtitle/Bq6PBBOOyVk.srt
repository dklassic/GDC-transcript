1
00:00:07,649 --> 00:00:08,930
Let's also go over some fun stuff.

2
00:00:10,191 --> 00:00:12,733
So one, A, you're going to tell your friends that they

3
00:00:12,753 --> 00:00:14,154
could see the talk on Vault.

4
00:00:14,814 --> 00:00:17,396
Two, we know that there's a lot of people inside and

5
00:00:17,476 --> 00:00:19,498
outside for portfolio reviews.

6
00:00:19,518 --> 00:00:22,480
And it's really important, our team here, everybody here, we

7
00:00:22,821 --> 00:00:23,781
want to see you.

8
00:00:24,342 --> 00:00:26,664
So we will make sure, don't worry about the time, we will

9
00:00:26,704 --> 00:00:29,806
see the very last person we're going to get

10
00:00:30,186 --> 00:00:30,907
through this together.

11
00:00:30,927 --> 00:00:33,869
OK, let's turn the volume up here.

12
00:00:36,302 --> 00:00:38,063
let's have some fun. Are you guys ready?

13
00:00:38,083 --> 00:00:45,527
Alright, I want to hear it. I need to feel the energy right now. Alright.

14
00:00:47,088 --> 00:00:47,448
Alright.

15
00:00:48,969 --> 00:00:49,369
Sweet.

16
00:00:50,330 --> 00:00:51,490
My name is Allison Kelly

17
00:00:52,191 --> 00:00:56,173
and I'm a private consultant to some of the top tier gaming developers. Why don't we

18
00:00:56,213 --> 00:00:57,153
introduce ourselves, guys?

19
00:00:59,454 --> 00:01:03,036
I can start at my end. I'm Claire Hummel. I'm the art director at Campo Santo,

20
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,677
currently working in the Valley of Gods.

21
00:01:09,867 --> 00:01:15,313
I'm Darren Bacon, I'm the lead concept artist at 343 Industries, who develops Halo.

22
00:01:20,279 --> 00:01:24,364
I'm Gavin Goulden, I'm the lead character artist at Insomniac, working on Spider-Man

23
00:01:24,424 --> 00:01:24,604
for PS4.

24
00:01:29,594 --> 00:01:33,297
I'm Wyeth, I've been in the game industry since the turn of the century, which is fun to be able to say.

25
00:01:33,317 --> 00:01:39,661
And I've been a production artist, lead artist, art director, and technical art director at Epic over the last 12 years.

26
00:01:40,361 --> 00:01:48,406
Hi, I'm Greg Furch, I'm the art director at Fraxxas for XCOM.

27
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:55,151
I've been there for about 21 years, I just passed 21 years, so...

28
00:01:55,451 --> 00:01:56,331
Yes, I'm a dinosaur.

29
00:01:57,839 --> 00:01:59,139
And Greg, I thought you were only, you know, 21.

30
00:01:59,399 --> 00:01:59,740
Yeah.

31
00:02:03,021 --> 00:02:03,281
Okay.

32
00:02:03,661 --> 00:02:07,923
And then Sean Robertson, who is on the panel, but we couldn't fit him up on our stage, could

33
00:02:07,943 --> 00:02:08,843
you just wave your hand?

34
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:14,925
I bet he went to go get coffee with slacking.

35
00:02:15,065 --> 00:02:15,545
Or bourbon.

36
00:02:16,446 --> 00:02:17,166
Ah, that's true.

37
00:02:17,266 --> 00:02:18,547
That is actually probably true.

38
00:02:19,127 --> 00:02:19,827
Okay.

39
00:02:19,907 --> 00:02:21,488
So how did you guys get started in the industry?

40
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:25,298
Anyone German?

41
00:02:25,318 --> 00:02:26,539
Sure, I'll take it, every time.

42
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:30,242
I technically got my start when I was 14 years old and

43
00:02:30,342 --> 00:02:33,485
emailed the website Neopets and said that their art was

44
00:02:33,545 --> 00:02:34,586
bad and my art was better.

45
00:02:34,606 --> 00:02:38,829
And so I worked there for about seven summers.

46
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:42,772
And then when I graduated from art college, I ended up at

47
00:02:42,972 --> 00:02:46,855
Xbox, they were recruiting at RISD, the college I went to.

48
00:02:47,075 --> 00:02:49,617
And I was absolutely expecting to get into animation, but

49
00:02:49,637 --> 00:02:51,199
they made a very compelling offer.

50
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:52,600
And 10 years later.

51
00:02:53,708 --> 00:02:56,689
still in games. So you took it. Yes, it worked out. Yeah.

52
00:02:58,169 --> 00:03:02,670
Darren. Yeah. Um, so, uh, when I was in art school,

53
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:07,631
I kind of spammed every game development company like up and down the left

54
00:03:07,671 --> 00:03:07,952
coast.

55
00:03:08,612 --> 00:03:12,513
And I was living in Pasadena and ended up getting a sort of a contract position

56
00:03:12,593 --> 00:03:14,053
for an internship in Seattle.

57
00:03:14,813 --> 00:03:18,334
And I was like making just enough money to pay my rent back in Pasadena.

58
00:03:18,834 --> 00:03:22,255
But that's sort of, uh, how I got in. So the takeaway, I guess, was.

59
00:03:23,017 --> 00:03:28,589
I just was super motivated and wanted to just kind of find any foot in the door I could.

60
00:03:30,722 --> 00:03:32,983
I'm going to start doing a duet here.

61
00:03:35,264 --> 00:03:39,806
So I actually went to art school to work for film and

62
00:03:39,906 --> 00:03:40,246
effects.

63
00:03:41,026 --> 00:03:43,087
Didn't like it because I wanted to make a character

64
00:03:43,307 --> 00:03:44,308
art portfolio.

65
00:03:44,588 --> 00:03:48,129
Dropped out, moved across the country, worked a bunch of

66
00:03:48,169 --> 00:03:50,110
random jobs while working on my portfolio.

67
00:03:50,290 --> 00:03:54,291
Got my foot in the door for a mobile company working on

68
00:03:55,112 --> 00:03:55,692
prehistoric.

69
00:03:56,727 --> 00:04:01,393
mobile phones way before iPhone, uh, you know, like old sports

70
00:04:01,413 --> 00:04:03,495
games and stuff like that and eventually I just worked my way

71
00:04:03,596 --> 00:04:07,000
up through pixel art doing, uh, I guess what would now be

72
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:12,267
hand-painted last gen, last, two last gens ago, uh, and then, uh,

73
00:04:12,687 --> 00:04:14,370
on from there for about 15 years now.

74
00:04:17,033 --> 00:04:18,614
My story is obtuse and complicated.

75
00:04:19,615 --> 00:04:21,636
So I'll tell the one important piece, I think, for you guys,

76
00:04:21,676 --> 00:04:23,877
which is there was a moment where there was a game

77
00:04:23,897 --> 00:04:26,479
developer I wanted to work for who put out an entreaty.

78
00:04:26,999 --> 00:04:29,881
This is a long time ago on Blue's News or some archaic

79
00:04:29,921 --> 00:04:31,082
website way back in the day.

80
00:04:31,542 --> 00:04:33,784
An entreaty to have somebody come and test their game.

81
00:04:34,124 --> 00:04:37,426
And I was working as a graphic designer, but I was not a game

82
00:04:37,446 --> 00:04:37,806
developer.

83
00:04:38,267 --> 00:04:40,608
And they put out this entreaty, and I wrote an

84
00:04:40,668 --> 00:04:42,409
impassioned email to that person.

85
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:44,390
And out of 350 emails, they picked mine.

86
00:04:46,792 --> 00:04:50,155
And that's one of these stories where you just have to keep pushing yourself,

87
00:04:50,436 --> 00:04:52,758
you just put yourself in these situations where people could find

88
00:04:52,778 --> 00:04:54,640
that you are a person of good taste.

89
00:04:54,980 --> 00:04:57,843
And something in that email was appealing to them.

90
00:04:58,083 --> 00:04:59,384
And so I said, come by and try it.

91
00:05:00,105 --> 00:05:01,326
And they were not hiring.

92
00:05:01,366 --> 00:05:02,708
They did not intend to hire anybody.

93
00:05:02,748 --> 00:05:03,348
They were not even looking.

94
00:05:03,368 --> 00:05:04,750
They just wanted somebody to come try their game.

95
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:06,952
And within six months, I was working in the industry

96
00:05:06,992 --> 00:05:09,775
because I made an impression on them and I showed them my portfolio and so on.

97
00:05:10,335 --> 00:05:15,517
So, just find a way in the door and then show that you have good taste, and that's going

98
00:05:15,537 --> 00:05:16,798
to be a good entry point.

99
00:05:19,999 --> 00:05:21,700
Yeah, I just kind of stumbled into it.

100
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,562
I was in art school doing illustration and actually doing editorial work while I was

101
00:05:26,822 --> 00:05:30,984
in school and kind of, there was an internship for a company called MicroProse.

102
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:33,065
Anybody ever heard of that?

103
00:05:34,163 --> 00:05:34,503
Crickets.

104
00:05:35,324 --> 00:05:35,804
Wow.

105
00:05:37,226 --> 00:05:37,746
Sid Meier.

106
00:05:37,786 --> 00:05:38,507
Ever heard of Sid Meier?

107
00:05:38,527 --> 00:05:40,749
Yeah, I hadn't when I was in school.

108
00:05:40,769 --> 00:05:42,150
I didn't know who the guy was with the big office.

109
00:05:43,371 --> 00:05:48,055
And so, yeah, I went to respond to an internship for

110
00:05:49,316 --> 00:05:51,198
doing illustration, which was what they were

111
00:05:51,218 --> 00:05:51,839
looking for at the time.

112
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,162
And yeah, it was supposed to be a two-year job till I got my

113
00:05:56,202 --> 00:05:58,064
freelance self settled.

114
00:05:59,115 --> 00:06:02,196
And 23 years later, I'm still doing it.

115
00:06:02,317 --> 00:06:04,557
So it kind of stuck.

116
00:06:05,178 --> 00:06:07,738
Oh, and I want to say one more thing, because Sean has

117
00:06:07,778 --> 00:06:09,239
gracefully not had a seat.

118
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:11,220
And he's off getting bourbon, as we've already established.

119
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:14,841
But he tells a story every year.

120
00:06:15,021 --> 00:06:16,141
And I'm not going to tell the whole story.

121
00:06:16,181 --> 00:06:19,282
I'm just going to say that that man saved every rejection

122
00:06:19,322 --> 00:06:20,303
letter he ever received.

123
00:06:20,823 --> 00:06:23,504
and he received dozens and they were in

124
00:06:23,844 --> 00:06:27,826
they were printed out, he got them in the mail after submitting his VHS reels

125
00:06:28,666 --> 00:06:32,628
decades ago. But he saved those things and they were his motivation

126
00:06:32,908 --> 00:06:35,709
and he is an absolute badass and that guy got rejected a lot

127
00:06:36,049 --> 00:06:41,871
so keep that in mind. So what is the most common issue you find in portfolios?

128
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:51,135
I'll lead us off.

129
00:06:51,776 --> 00:06:54,678
I would say that for me, the most common issue that I

130
00:06:54,718 --> 00:06:58,362
really see is portfolios that don't really have a voice.

131
00:06:58,722 --> 00:07:02,145
I can guarantee that everyone in this room has a voice for

132
00:07:02,205 --> 00:07:03,806
your art or whatever you're working on.

133
00:07:04,287 --> 00:07:06,529
And a lot of times, it's really easy to fall into the

134
00:07:06,569 --> 00:07:09,892
trap of aping what you already see in the industry of trying

135
00:07:09,912 --> 00:07:12,314
to sort of repeat that back, because you see that it's

136
00:07:12,334 --> 00:07:14,416
successful, so you want to do more of it.

137
00:07:15,256 --> 00:07:16,658
But it's important to remember that.

138
00:07:17,258 --> 00:07:21,941
what makes good art in this industry is usually new and fresh and exciting.

139
00:07:22,001 --> 00:07:26,584
And whether that's the research you're doing, your personal interests, your life experience,

140
00:07:27,005 --> 00:07:29,606
bringing that to the table and having it come through.

141
00:07:30,103 --> 00:07:34,945
in the work that you're choosing to show to people instead of just the same paladins and

142
00:07:35,005 --> 00:07:39,087
the same space marines over and over again, and the same environments that have those

143
00:07:39,247 --> 00:07:42,608
spiky rock formations that don't really exist in real life.

144
00:07:43,388 --> 00:07:47,270
If you show that research and it comes through, it really makes your work stand out.

145
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,372
Even if there are people who are technically better than you, if that concept and intention

146
00:07:53,852 --> 00:07:56,233
comes through in your portfolio, it's super important.

147
00:07:58,174 --> 00:08:01,595
Yeah, Claire's right, except if you have really cool space

148
00:08:01,635 --> 00:08:02,836
marines, you should show them to me.

149
00:08:02,856 --> 00:08:10,758
Yeah, I think the voice thing is like the key takeaway. I

150
00:08:10,778 --> 00:08:15,100
think if you, at least for me or what I've noticed, if you are

151
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:18,101
super passionate about something, it's going to sort of

152
00:08:18,141 --> 00:08:22,222
show itself in the work. So it's sort of like, it's chicken and

153
00:08:22,242 --> 00:08:22,722
egg thing, but...

154
00:08:23,445 --> 00:08:26,548
If you are super passionate about it, the result will be

155
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:30,531
more inspiring work and stuff that other artists maybe

156
00:08:30,551 --> 00:08:31,372
haven't seen before.

157
00:08:31,392 --> 00:08:35,635
Can I rant about pet peeves for a second?

158
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,757
So a few things about portfolios for me that stand

159
00:08:38,817 --> 00:08:40,819
out as common problems.

160
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:45,843
One would be no focus or thinking that having a

161
00:08:45,923 --> 00:08:48,185
quantity over quality is better.

162
00:08:49,143 --> 00:08:53,225
Generally, I find that a lot of, especially like newer portfolios will have like everything

163
00:08:53,245 --> 00:08:58,028
you can possibly do is in this portfolio, but what that actually does is waters out

164
00:08:58,408 --> 00:09:00,369
or waters down your actual skill.

165
00:09:00,469 --> 00:09:07,632
So focusing more on, you know, your best discipline, your best pieces and just editing that down

166
00:09:07,752 --> 00:09:11,834
is way better than showing you can do everything imaginable or at least attempt to.

167
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:16,277
And then having a portfolio of only sculpts for a game art.

168
00:09:17,686 --> 00:09:22,230
position is just makes my blood boil. I never want to see one ever again.

169
00:09:23,992 --> 00:09:27,915
I won't belabor any of these points other than to say take your entire portfolio, divide

170
00:09:27,936 --> 00:09:32,260
it in half and subtract two pieces and that's the number of pieces you actually should have

171
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:32,940
in your portfolio.

172
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:37,354
Why, just to elaborate on that, you want to see two amazing,

173
00:09:37,474 --> 00:09:38,816
not a bunch of mediocre.

174
00:09:39,316 --> 00:09:41,578
You'd rather see two pieces that are really amazing.

175
00:09:41,598 --> 00:09:43,160
You're only as good as your weakest piece.

176
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:46,082
And the classic thing we'll do is

177
00:09:46,102 --> 00:09:48,204
we'll look at your first piece, which is usually the thing

178
00:09:48,244 --> 00:09:50,746
that's in your ego as the best thing you've ever done,

179
00:09:50,766 --> 00:09:52,548
and then we'll just switch to the last page.

180
00:09:52,868 --> 00:09:54,550
And if they're really dissimilar, we're like, ah.

181
00:09:55,050 --> 00:09:55,531
Yeah, okay.

182
00:09:56,031 --> 00:09:59,952
You know, and you can immediately see there's this big, you know, difference.

183
00:10:00,672 --> 00:10:04,634
Either it's taste level or it's a lack of awareness or it's a lack of just putting in

184
00:10:04,654 --> 00:10:06,334
the time to even your quality.

185
00:10:07,014 --> 00:10:09,015
But it's the first thing we see for sure.

186
00:10:09,335 --> 00:10:13,497
Yeah, this is probably weird coming from me, but I think it was like Coco Chanel that said

187
00:10:14,717 --> 00:10:18,338
before you're leaving the house, like, you take off one piece of jewelry or something

188
00:10:18,358 --> 00:10:18,638
like that.

189
00:10:19,139 --> 00:10:21,119
Actually, it was add another piece of jewelry.

190
00:10:21,139 --> 00:10:21,659
Was it add?

191
00:10:21,699 --> 00:10:21,859
No.

192
00:10:21,879 --> 00:10:24,040
Yes, it was add another necklace.

193
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:24,400
It was add.

194
00:10:25,272 --> 00:10:32,677
Really? Yes. Add another necklace? Okay, well in my version... So, I guess, so Darren's changing the brand.

195
00:10:32,777 --> 00:10:42,204
What does Coco know? Chanel had terrible advice. I'm pretty sure of that. What does Coco Bacon say? I'm going to double check.

196
00:10:42,304 --> 00:10:43,445
Greg? Take out something.

197
00:10:44,826 --> 00:10:51,330
I just think, you know, it all kind of goes to that quality versus quantity thing, but like Claire said, I think...

198
00:10:52,215 --> 00:10:57,717
is the voice part of it, like that's how you,

199
00:10:57,797 --> 00:11:00,938
that's a powerful way to think about how you edit your work.

200
00:11:00,978 --> 00:11:03,299
Like if it's not scatter shot,

201
00:11:03,319 --> 00:11:04,419
you're not shooting with a shotgun.

202
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:07,800
And so trying to think about it,

203
00:11:07,961 --> 00:11:11,082
I've never actually heard somebody describe it that way,

204
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:13,582
but the voice and like how that applies to it,

205
00:11:13,702 --> 00:11:14,663
it's really right on.

206
00:11:14,703 --> 00:11:17,964
Like use that voice to help you kinda,

207
00:11:18,884 --> 00:11:22,286
thin the herd. If it doesn't fall within your voice, maybe it shouldn't be in your portfolio.

208
00:11:22,886 --> 00:11:25,668
So that's a really, really good point.

209
00:11:27,349 --> 00:11:31,071
How do you decide what format is the best for a portfolio

210
00:11:31,231 --> 00:11:33,032
and when is it appropriate to have a demo reel?

211
00:11:33,052 --> 00:11:36,514
I'm looking at you.

212
00:11:38,535 --> 00:11:38,935
Opinions?

213
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:49,734
generally for anything that would require motion is what you should use a demo reel for.

214
00:11:50,895 --> 00:11:55,839
For like character art, I mean, you know, concept art or anything that is generally still

215
00:11:55,859 --> 00:12:02,023
that you could sell within a series of images, you know, like a turnaround of just static

216
00:12:02,243 --> 00:12:08,368
images is far superior than doing like a demo reel just because, I mean, I can get into it.

217
00:12:08,928 --> 00:12:12,610
the loading times, you'll end up skipping around just to see like different angles of a character.

218
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:17,754
You'll probably have a lot of your work missed. Compression, for something like this, it's going

219
00:12:17,774 --> 00:12:24,858
to be load time too. You're just really, you know, shooting yourself in the foot. But for animation

220
00:12:24,938 --> 00:12:31,423
effects, things that actually require you to see motion in the work, a demo reel is the way to go.

221
00:12:33,711 --> 00:12:37,973
I would say for character models also a lot of places like Art Station or if you're building

222
00:12:37,993 --> 00:12:41,955
your own website you can embed Marmoset viewers and things to view models.

223
00:12:41,995 --> 00:12:46,057
You should still have turnarounds because those suckers do not always load but it's

224
00:12:46,117 --> 00:12:51,200
so much easier than having to wade through, as you said, just like skipping ahead on a

225
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:52,501
demo reel for a single model.

226
00:12:57,111 --> 00:13:01,132
Okay. Yeah, I think concept can be super simple. Like I, I once

227
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:04,352
submitted a demo reel and I don't know why, it was just like

228
00:13:04,372 --> 00:13:09,493
that was the format they wanted but it was, it seemed odd. I

229
00:13:09,513 --> 00:13:12,074
wouldn't, I would like rather just thumb through JPEGs than

230
00:13:12,934 --> 00:13:18,315
scrub through a video. First. Yes. Are blogs appropriate to

231
00:13:18,375 --> 00:13:21,756
include in a portfolio process versus practice?

232
00:13:25,464 --> 00:13:27,005
We were kind of talking about this yesterday.

233
00:13:27,105 --> 00:13:33,491
I feel like it's really interesting to see someone's blog as an addition to your portfolio.

234
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:38,135
So if you have a website, being able to have it as a link at the bottom of the page or

235
00:13:38,175 --> 00:13:43,219
a drop-down menu of all of your social media, it's a great way for someone to look at your

236
00:13:43,319 --> 00:13:46,862
curated portfolio of the work, your best work that you want to put in front of someone.

237
00:13:47,342 --> 00:13:51,005
And then if an art director is thinking, hey, I want to see more of this person's work.

238
00:13:51,415 --> 00:13:55,837
it would be fantastic if there was an Instagram or a Tumblr that I could click through to.

239
00:13:56,278 --> 00:14:00,460
And so that gives them the option without overcrowding your portfolio.

240
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,303
The other thing I just want to say about something like a process blog is one of the main things

241
00:14:06,343 --> 00:14:12,425
that we're looking for is the ability for someone who is applying to self-edit because

242
00:14:12,465 --> 00:14:18,388
we can see what they view as their apex work or the varieties of things they want to show.

243
00:14:18,969 --> 00:14:22,091
So, if there's a big process blog and you're like, hey, look at all my work.

244
00:14:22,512 --> 00:14:25,034
I don't know when you're learning or when you're experimenting or

245
00:14:25,054 --> 00:14:26,936
when you're trying something outside of your comfort zone.

246
00:14:27,156 --> 00:14:28,617
And I don't know what you consider good.

247
00:14:28,637 --> 00:14:30,259
I just see a bunch of stuff.

248
00:14:30,739 --> 00:14:35,623
So, to me, a process blog or a link like that is not in any way, shape, or

249
00:14:35,663 --> 00:14:36,464
form a portfolio.

250
00:14:36,704 --> 00:14:39,607
Cuz it tells us absolutely nothing about you editing yourself

251
00:14:40,508 --> 00:14:42,890
down to the essence of why we should hire you.

252
00:14:46,813 --> 00:14:49,521
What role should traditional art have in a portfolio?

253
00:14:52,743 --> 00:14:54,964
This is funny because this came up yesterday.

254
00:14:54,984 --> 00:14:56,945
We all talk about what we're going to talk about a little

255
00:14:56,965 --> 00:15:00,147
bit, kind of pregame, the day before.

256
00:15:00,167 --> 00:15:01,808
And so it's really funny.

257
00:15:02,128 --> 00:15:05,650
When we talked about this, and this is actually kind of going

258
00:15:05,870 --> 00:15:09,052
back and forth over the years a little bit, but it was funny.

259
00:15:09,872 --> 00:15:13,654
Traditional media came up yesterday, and we were talking

260
00:15:13,694 --> 00:15:16,416
about is it important to see figure work?

261
00:15:18,336 --> 00:15:33,502
And it's kind of funny, I think we all kind of came around to the fact that like, you know, it's like, no, like, if that's not what you're doing, like, I don't, I'm going to see that, we're going to see that in your work, whether or not you provide us with, you know, figure drawings, you know, it's going to come through in the other stuff.

262
00:15:35,263 --> 00:15:36,583
And so, yeah, it's kind of.

263
00:15:37,203 --> 00:15:39,724
Yeah, I like, I respect really good figure drawing.

264
00:15:40,085 --> 00:15:40,845
Yeah, absolutely.

265
00:15:40,865 --> 00:15:43,486
It just doesn't really fit into the equation.

266
00:15:44,123 --> 00:15:47,964
And you can kind of like suss it out already with most concepts that you see.

267
00:15:47,984 --> 00:15:50,365
Like, can this person understand anatomy, right?

268
00:15:50,545 --> 00:15:50,965
Yeah, it's true.

269
00:15:50,985 --> 00:15:54,645
And I think, like, at Art Center, they used to always say, like, you have to get really good at drawing the form,

270
00:15:54,685 --> 00:15:59,786
and you either do it through figure drawing or the car, so, or like automotive.

271
00:16:00,966 --> 00:16:05,867
And so I think it's sort of like, as a result of being a really good figure drawer,

272
00:16:06,367 --> 00:16:11,768
you'll most likely, you know, have really good foundations and good art skills.

273
00:16:12,932 --> 00:16:16,234
and at best it's a small positive for your portfolio

274
00:16:16,714 --> 00:16:19,276
and at worst your figure drawings are really good

275
00:16:19,336 --> 00:16:21,097
and it's not coming through in your concepts,

276
00:16:21,517 --> 00:16:23,899
then that's a huge ding to your portfolio.

277
00:16:23,919 --> 00:16:25,620
So you wanna be really thoughtful about that.

278
00:16:26,877 --> 00:16:33,258
I did want to touch on the idea of just traditional work in a portfolio or in a games pipeline.

279
00:16:34,178 --> 00:16:38,399
There are definitely people who do it, who do traditional concept work, but it's definitely

280
00:16:38,499 --> 00:16:42,600
it's a lot harder when you have to scan things, when you have to do iterations on pieces.

281
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:48,621
So it's not like, oh, I immediately wouldn't hire someone, but if someone is not proficient

282
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:54,583
in Photoshop or the ability to quickly move around and move at the pace of a games pipeline.

283
00:16:55,163 --> 00:16:57,245
then that definitely can become a problem.

284
00:16:59,868 --> 00:17:05,133
With most artists having a presence on ArtStation, is there any benefit to maintaining a separate

285
00:17:05,153 --> 00:17:06,013
portfolio site?

286
00:17:07,935 --> 00:17:09,717
Oh, Gavin, you look like you have an opinion on this.

287
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:11,539
I should start speaking over it.

288
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:13,461
Yes, it's beaming.

289
00:17:14,722 --> 00:17:16,223
In my opinion, no.

290
00:17:18,860 --> 00:17:22,721
basically if you're at the stage where you create a portfolio looking for your first job,

291
00:17:23,382 --> 00:17:28,224
any time you have to spare should be spent on making that work better. So if you're spending

292
00:17:28,264 --> 00:17:34,026
time web designing and trying to get your portfolio working right or anything like that,

293
00:17:34,746 --> 00:17:40,108
it's kind of a waste when ArtStation already exists and it's already searchable, it's already

294
00:17:40,189 --> 00:17:46,671
like a hub for people to go to like us looking for new contractors, new team members and stuff

295
00:17:46,691 --> 00:17:47,071
like that.

296
00:17:47,171 --> 00:17:47,311
So...

297
00:17:48,189 --> 00:17:51,377
You know, for me it's better investment just to put it back

298
00:17:51,397 --> 00:17:53,001
into work instead of in a website.

299
00:17:54,765 --> 00:17:56,770
I will say it's also, it's nice if.

300
00:17:57,459 --> 00:18:02,120
if someone has, if you're using ArtStation as your primary portfolio to use the ArtStation

301
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:07,902
Pro that allows you to have a domain name and a polished portfolio site. I personally,

302
00:18:07,922 --> 00:18:16,484
I keep my own portfolio site using Squarespace.com. Because it's so much easier to just like toss

303
00:18:16,544 --> 00:18:21,526
work up there without having to like label all of the stuff that I use for it. But pretty

304
00:18:21,566 --> 00:18:21,706
much.

305
00:18:22,505 --> 00:18:25,787
As you said, like ArtStation can just turn into a portfolio site now.

306
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,109
So if you want to have one, that's fine.

307
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:30,150
But yeah, do not waste time.

308
00:18:30,231 --> 00:18:34,654
Do not feel like you need to learn CSS and impress people with your web design skills

309
00:18:35,194 --> 00:18:36,355
just for a portfolio site.

310
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:39,177
Greg, do you have a comment?

311
00:18:40,318 --> 00:18:40,598
Yeah.

312
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:41,299
I mean, I think that's...

313
00:18:41,710 --> 00:18:42,250
I think that's right.

314
00:18:42,350 --> 00:18:43,431
It's always, it's not bad.

315
00:18:43,491 --> 00:18:47,155
I, it's not bad to have something else that you can find.

316
00:18:48,376 --> 00:18:51,980
But yeah, I think it's taking away too much of your, of your, if you're seriously, you're

317
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:55,403
that pressed for time, you know, trying to get your work done.

318
00:18:55,423 --> 00:19:00,348
Maybe you shouldn't do it, but, but I think, you know, having this other presence sometimes

319
00:19:00,408 --> 00:19:05,673
to kind of separate you from the herd is sometimes it's not a bad, a bad choice.

320
00:19:06,756 --> 00:19:14,706
custom layouts in art station. Also if you have multiple sites

321
00:19:14,766 --> 00:19:18,091
keep them all up to date. It is so sad if someone finds your

322
00:19:18,111 --> 00:19:20,895
deviant art and you haven't updated in eight years. They're

323
00:19:20,935 --> 00:19:23,598
like this person is not great. They're nine years old.

324
00:19:26,323 --> 00:19:31,406
So keep the content relevant and also have it maybe in one

325
00:19:31,506 --> 00:19:33,748
area, like you don't want to have one site that's eight

326
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,470
years old and one site that's brand new, because when

327
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,552
someone's trying to look for you, you don't know what

328
00:19:39,592 --> 00:19:40,233
you're getting.

329
00:19:40,953 --> 00:19:41,213
Right?

330
00:19:42,634 --> 00:19:46,617
So do you expect to see models and animation in game

331
00:19:46,677 --> 00:19:47,298
engines?

332
00:19:47,698 --> 00:19:47,918
Yes.

333
00:19:48,198 --> 00:19:48,518
Yes.

334
00:19:49,239 --> 00:19:49,579
Please.

335
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:52,461
Is that because maybe you're from Epic?

336
00:19:54,689 --> 00:19:58,956
Any real time preview that is applicable to game technology,

337
00:19:59,097 --> 00:19:59,477
Allison.

338
00:19:59,497 --> 00:20:00,659
Where's your game engine?

339
00:20:01,401 --> 00:20:02,583
I just like to make fun of them.

340
00:20:03,565 --> 00:20:05,909
You've got to show your work in engine.

341
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:11,539
we have huge pet peeves about sculpts that are like renders

342
00:20:11,619 --> 00:20:12,940
in Max or whatever.

343
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:16,842
It's near pointless, and I basically don't care.

344
00:20:17,062 --> 00:20:18,823
Like, that's how strongly I feel about it.

345
00:20:19,463 --> 00:20:21,564
You have to show that you can go all the way through the

346
00:20:21,584 --> 00:20:23,765
pipeline, all the way to the bitter end, because all the

347
00:20:23,865 --> 00:20:26,747
easiest stuff is in ZBrush, not discounting the incredible

348
00:20:26,787 --> 00:20:27,887
talent that happens there.

349
00:20:28,188 --> 00:20:30,509
But the easy work is there, and then making it look good

350
00:20:30,549 --> 00:20:33,030
at the very, very tippy top of the mountain way down here,

351
00:20:33,470 --> 00:20:35,251
that's like the 90% hard case.

352
00:20:35,632 --> 00:20:36,272
So you've got to show it.

353
00:20:36,312 --> 00:20:36,792
You've got to show it.

354
00:20:37,383 --> 00:20:45,825
I mean for character art animation really like any of the disciplines I find almost

355
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:52,547
like the creative part is half the job and then the problem solving technical implementation

356
00:20:52,647 --> 00:20:53,347
is the other half.

357
00:20:53,687 --> 00:21:00,349
So as much as I love ZBrush and sculpts and you know modeling and whatever package and

358
00:21:00,369 --> 00:21:04,130
just normal animation reels and stuff, it doesn't show that you.

359
00:21:05,126 --> 00:21:11,930
can put it into context so you can only do the actual art part, not the game development

360
00:21:12,190 --> 00:21:17,754
part and uh that's what we're doing. We're basically hiring very skilled problem solvers

361
00:21:17,994 --> 00:21:22,676
more than an animator in Max, you know, or Maya. What are people animated? Maya?

362
00:21:22,897 --> 00:21:25,818
Who's to say? Anything. Whatever you've animated.

363
00:21:27,479 --> 00:21:30,300
The fact that these jobs are problem solving is such a good point.

364
00:21:30,660 --> 00:21:33,361
Like, that is very much the definition of working in games,

365
00:21:33,441 --> 00:21:38,742
is you have these limited parameters, as concept artists, but especially as modelers, as animators.

366
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:45,124
And understanding that you have to work within those parameters and find creative solutions is so important.

367
00:21:47,605 --> 00:21:53,267
Should a portfolio be as broad as possible, or should it be specialized in the given style technique?

368
00:21:56,033 --> 00:21:57,794
I mean, I think it depends on studio.

369
00:21:57,854 --> 00:22:03,416
You know, we were talking about this earlier, but for a company like Insomniac, we have

370
00:22:03,516 --> 00:22:04,916
more specialized roles.

371
00:22:05,517 --> 00:22:10,639
So again, going back to the problem-solving thing, I mean, I want a creative character

372
00:22:10,679 --> 00:22:16,261
artist who can, you know, adapt their abilities to our project, right?

373
00:22:16,461 --> 00:22:21,603
So style doesn't necessarily matter, especially because we have such a diverse portfolio,

374
00:22:21,763 --> 00:22:22,023
but...

375
00:22:23,153 --> 00:22:26,316
You know, as long as they show the skill, they show like the technical know-how and stuff like that,

376
00:22:26,416 --> 00:22:27,777
they'll generally be a good fit.

377
00:22:27,817 --> 00:22:31,400
But for a more independent company or like a smaller team,

378
00:22:32,301 --> 00:22:34,042
I find that it's going more into generalization.

379
00:22:34,183 --> 00:22:38,506
So weighing more on that like technical side or the, not jack of all trades,

380
00:22:38,566 --> 00:22:43,631
but having, you know, a multidisciplinary portfolio is almost more fitting.

381
00:22:45,006 --> 00:22:47,728
Yeah, which the summary there is know who you're applying to.

382
00:22:48,428 --> 00:22:50,310
You've got to be aware of the company you're applying to and

383
00:22:50,330 --> 00:22:51,251
tailor your portfolio.

384
00:22:51,291 --> 00:22:55,013
There's no such thing as a one size fits all portfolio ever.

385
00:22:55,754 --> 00:22:57,635
You have to know exactly who you're sending it to, you know

386
00:22:57,655 --> 00:22:59,797
exactly what you're applying for, and then you tailor it,

387
00:23:00,217 --> 00:23:02,138
take out stuff that's not relevant, put in extra stuff

388
00:23:02,158 --> 00:23:02,839
you might have that is.

389
00:23:03,359 --> 00:23:04,000
That's the thing.

390
00:23:05,900 --> 00:23:11,645
I actually feel like in my position right now, I'm actually seeing this shift in the

391
00:23:11,685 --> 00:23:17,730
way that we're hiring in that I'm not looking for something that's super diverse, but I'm

392
00:23:17,791 --> 00:23:22,254
looking for somebody that has a second skill.

393
00:23:22,535 --> 00:23:25,437
They may not be great at it, but they're pretty good at it.

394
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:29,200
And so as I'm hiring now and I'm seeing this...

395
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:35,372
in both what we're doing at Firaxis and with some of my

396
00:23:35,393 --> 00:23:36,697
other friends in the industry, is that we're actually

397
00:23:37,743 --> 00:23:42,145
kind of looking for just a little bit more than a specialization. So we're not going

398
00:23:42,185 --> 00:23:46,207
fully like I want somebody to do everything, but I want somebody that's got this primary

399
00:23:46,227 --> 00:23:50,128
thing that they're really good at and this other thing that they're pretty good at that

400
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:55,831
I might be able to leverage later. And so I kind of feel like there's some shifting

401
00:23:55,871 --> 00:23:59,972
going on right now. So I don't know how you guys feel about that.

402
00:24:02,162 --> 00:24:07,067
I would you recommend showing that in a portfolio to have like so if you have like five levels

403
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:11,492
and character art and then like one level and you know shader artist or something like

404
00:24:11,512 --> 00:24:17,720
that would you just so that you know we don't go back on our.

405
00:24:18,455 --> 00:24:23,079
over quantity thing. So would you have a few pieces of character art and then an example

406
00:24:23,179 --> 00:24:25,060
of like shader work or something like that?

407
00:24:25,240 --> 00:24:30,144
Yeah. Yeah. I think if you're really good at one thing and you've got this other thing

408
00:24:30,244 --> 00:24:36,008
that you're pretty good at, it shouldn't be a huge drop off. And it should be something

409
00:24:36,189 --> 00:24:41,432
like related. Like if you're an animator, right, and I don't want to just hire an animator

410
00:24:41,452 --> 00:24:44,475
anymore. I want to hire an animator that's got cinematic skills, right, that's got some

411
00:24:44,515 --> 00:24:47,637
sort of cinematic understanding and tendency.

412
00:24:48,257 --> 00:24:49,918
That's easy enough to build into your reel, right?

413
00:24:50,478 --> 00:24:59,641
If you're an environment modeler, maybe you can do some layout as well and world building.

414
00:25:00,121 --> 00:25:02,022
So I'm not just looking for a prop artist anymore.

415
00:25:02,082 --> 00:25:07,223
I want somebody that can give me a little more if I need it somewhere else and has a

416
00:25:07,383 --> 00:25:08,644
little more diversified interest.

417
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,285
But I don't know.

418
00:25:11,545 --> 00:25:13,967
Well, if you think about what you're talking about as a

419
00:25:14,007 --> 00:25:15,749
color wheel, you're talking about complementary colors.

420
00:25:15,929 --> 00:25:18,291
You're not talking about like, I'm an animator who also

421
00:25:18,412 --> 00:25:19,853
lights whatever.

422
00:25:19,933 --> 00:25:21,094
Like, those are weird.

423
00:25:21,114 --> 00:25:23,136
Like, I don't understand how to parse that portfolio.

424
00:25:23,436 --> 00:25:25,418
But if you're like, I'm an environment modeler, but I'm

425
00:25:25,578 --> 00:25:27,380
also doing set dressing, a little lighting, and I can do

426
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,822
some post-processing, you're like, ah, that's the guy.

427
00:25:29,842 --> 00:25:30,242
Absolutely.

428
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:32,510
I don't know.

429
00:25:32,550 --> 00:25:35,291
I kind of feel like there's, I do feel like there's something shifting right now.

430
00:25:36,691 --> 00:25:37,612
I don't think we're the only ones.

431
00:25:37,632 --> 00:25:41,113
I mean, budgets are getting huge and I think people are starting to look a little more

432
00:25:41,173 --> 00:25:46,555
like, okay, can I get something that's a little bit, a little bit more than just this scalpel.

433
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,856
But again, it's got to be something complementary to what they're doing.

434
00:25:49,896 --> 00:25:53,397
It's if you're an environment model, or if you're a world builder, maybe you're into

435
00:25:53,417 --> 00:25:54,278
lighting, right?

436
00:25:54,658 --> 00:25:59,760
And so you're getting just a little bit of something extra, but it's not completely in

437
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,240
left field.

438
00:26:00,620 --> 00:26:00,740
So.

439
00:26:01,769 --> 00:26:03,995
I do think I find that as well.

440
00:26:04,055 --> 00:26:06,663
So it's not so much like I'm looking for.

441
00:26:07,462 --> 00:26:10,723
a person that you could put in on the animation team from character art or something. But

442
00:26:11,163 --> 00:26:15,965
I think almost all of my hires have been leaning more towards the technical side. So knowing

443
00:26:16,325 --> 00:26:20,567
like shader set up, knowing like all of our like best practices for like our, you know,

444
00:26:20,607 --> 00:26:26,009
our engine and stuff like that. Like I'm kind of looking more at that on top of all the

445
00:26:26,089 --> 00:26:29,251
art. So it's like, well, you know, I can kind of have both. I have somebody who knows like

446
00:26:29,271 --> 00:26:32,072
the technical side more too. So they can kind of help out for sure.

447
00:26:33,312 --> 00:26:35,653
How do you avoid portfolio cliches?

448
00:26:37,252 --> 00:26:39,493
and actually put more originality in your portfolio.

449
00:26:42,415 --> 00:26:43,856
Darren's looking for space marines.

450
00:26:44,397 --> 00:26:46,238
Yeah.

451
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:47,318
Just add more space.

452
00:26:47,459 --> 00:26:49,300
Eventually it'll come around, right?

453
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:50,841
Space marines will be different now.

454
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:55,024
You know, I think it's kind of gets back

455
00:26:55,044 --> 00:26:56,144
to what we were talking about earlier.

456
00:26:56,645 --> 00:26:58,546
If you're finding what you're passionate about

457
00:26:58,766 --> 00:26:59,807
and letting that drive you,

458
00:27:00,447 --> 00:27:02,608
it's gonna be harder to sort of wind up

459
00:27:02,989 --> 00:27:03,829
producing that stuff.

460
00:27:05,398 --> 00:27:09,520
But it happens, I mean I think there's also a level of

461
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,701
execution too, right?

462
00:27:10,741 --> 00:27:12,903
Because like a lot of things can be cliche, but if you can

463
00:27:12,963 --> 00:27:15,864
sort of do it, put a twist on it or something or do it your

464
00:27:15,924 --> 00:27:19,267
own way, I mean I think you could probably say a lot of my

465
00:27:19,307 --> 00:27:20,607
portfolio is a cliche.

466
00:27:21,548 --> 00:27:24,790
But I just execute it differently maybe.

467
00:27:26,131 --> 00:27:28,752
So yeah, I think it's just like, it's kind of like how

468
00:27:28,793 --> 00:27:29,133
you do it.

469
00:27:30,936 --> 00:27:31,796
Yeah, I'd agree with that.

470
00:27:31,856 --> 00:27:36,358
I feel like a lot of my interests are very tropey, like I love westerns, I love dinosaurs.

471
00:27:36,458 --> 00:27:42,340
I'm working on a game about Egypt, and it's all about finding that particularly interesting

472
00:27:42,380 --> 00:27:42,660
way.

473
00:27:42,740 --> 00:27:45,681
For me, it's often like a historical event and very research heavy.

474
00:27:46,161 --> 00:27:49,382
But if you can bring something new to the table, like I follow a lot of artists who

475
00:27:49,402 --> 00:27:54,764
do very cool space marines, so I feel like I need to make sure that my stance on space

476
00:27:54,804 --> 00:27:57,345
marines does not follow me out of this room.

477
00:27:59,564 --> 00:28:02,005
There's a quote about originality that I love,

478
00:28:02,385 --> 00:28:05,167
which is that the definition of it is two things you know

479
00:28:05,267 --> 00:28:06,668
combined in a way you didn't expect.

480
00:28:07,388 --> 00:28:10,450
And that, I just adore that phrase,

481
00:28:10,490 --> 00:28:12,111
and I live my life basically that way.

482
00:28:12,131 --> 00:28:14,792
And I think that's exactly how you reflect that

483
00:28:14,832 --> 00:28:17,353
in a portfolio, which is it's okay to derive

484
00:28:17,393 --> 00:28:18,234
from things that are known.

485
00:28:18,294 --> 00:28:20,275
In fact, that's where all the things come from.

486
00:28:20,675 --> 00:28:23,016
Just find a little bit of a bias that makes it yours

487
00:28:23,056 --> 00:28:26,398
so that we can infer that when we look at the portfolio.

488
00:28:27,295 --> 00:28:28,036
I hope someone's taking notes for me.

489
00:28:28,056 --> 00:28:29,637
It also has to build your personality in it.

490
00:28:32,179 --> 00:28:34,981
What role should school projects have in a portfolio?

491
00:28:38,184 --> 00:28:39,064
Can I see this a lot?

492
00:28:40,105 --> 00:28:43,408
Well, you know, I know I don't want to throw my other bus,

493
00:28:43,428 --> 00:28:47,171
but I think you have to have it at a certain point.

494
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:52,095
Do your best to remove it as fast as you can.

495
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:57,575
Yeah, I feel like schoolwork is very clearly schoolwork.

496
00:28:58,015 --> 00:29:03,157
If it's an individual project, and it's

497
00:29:03,217 --> 00:29:05,117
being assigned to 30 different people,

498
00:29:05,137 --> 00:29:06,998
you start to see that repeating project.

499
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:09,779
I look at my classmates who graduated the same year I did,

500
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:13,521
and you can definitely see those same assignments

501
00:29:13,581 --> 00:29:14,701
in all of our portfolios.

502
00:29:14,721 --> 00:29:16,802
You want to get it out as fast as you can.

503
00:29:17,262 --> 00:29:18,763
And if you work on a group project,

504
00:29:19,063 --> 00:29:20,803
be abundantly transparent.

505
00:29:21,244 --> 00:29:23,907
about what your role was and where people helped you.

506
00:29:23,987 --> 00:29:28,813
It's not a weakness to say this was a group project, here's who did this and this.

507
00:29:29,273 --> 00:29:33,458
In fact that shows that you work well on a team, that you can collaborate with people.

508
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:39,506
So do whatever you can to edit down your work on that project to really focus primarily

509
00:29:39,586 --> 00:29:40,727
on what you contributed.

510
00:29:42,483 --> 00:29:46,445
So we're going to take this time, we have a couple more questions to go, but if people

511
00:29:46,465 --> 00:29:51,868
would like to ask some questions, I'd like you to line up and we'll begin after two questions.

512
00:29:52,548 --> 00:29:55,089
You just can line up and ask your question to the panel.

513
00:29:56,290 --> 00:30:01,613
So what area of the game art production do you see more demand and talent than supply

514
00:30:01,673 --> 00:30:01,813
for?

515
00:30:05,403 --> 00:30:10,525
I think tech art is huge and it's also one of those things that's still defining itself.

516
00:30:11,346 --> 00:30:14,907
It's a really broad thing and that's actually kind of breaking down into specialization.

517
00:30:17,088 --> 00:30:22,731
And then I think UI, I mean if you went to the show earlier this week, the first two

518
00:30:22,771 --> 00:30:26,173
talks I saw were talks on UI and they were amazing.

519
00:30:30,819 --> 00:30:35,280
I don't think the industry is about right now is that this generation is going to define

520
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:36,881
itself by like more model fidelity.

521
00:30:37,501 --> 00:30:38,281
Like we've already done that.

522
00:30:38,461 --> 00:30:43,282
Like I think what you're going to be seeing, like the way I see next gen right now, it's

523
00:30:43,322 --> 00:30:44,443
about the trailing disciplines.

524
00:30:44,983 --> 00:30:46,143
It's about animation.

525
00:30:46,303 --> 00:30:47,504
It's about effects.

526
00:30:47,684 --> 00:30:48,564
It's about audio.

527
00:30:49,464 --> 00:30:50,345
It's about UI.

528
00:30:50,425 --> 00:30:50,545
Like.

529
00:30:50,965 --> 00:30:53,307
those are the things that are going to get more fidelity now.

530
00:30:53,327 --> 00:30:55,369
So it's a little more subtle, but it's

531
00:30:55,409 --> 00:30:56,610
going to be really robust.

532
00:30:57,050 --> 00:30:59,633
And so I think that those are places

533
00:30:59,673 --> 00:31:02,696
where if you're trying to find your place

534
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:04,497
and you have an interest in those things,

535
00:31:04,978 --> 00:31:07,059
those are you, as an effects artist,

536
00:31:07,080 --> 00:31:09,962
you will never look for a job if you're good.

537
00:31:10,222 --> 00:31:11,243
You'll never have to worry about it.

538
00:31:11,644 --> 00:31:14,646
I think to piggyback on UI, too, just good graphic design.

539
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:17,259
not, it's hard to do.

540
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:18,159
Mm-hmm.

541
00:31:18,179 --> 00:31:21,561
And also, I also see that moving into more of a motion graphics role.

542
00:31:21,581 --> 00:31:21,741
Yeah.

543
00:31:21,841 --> 00:31:22,001
Mm-hmm.

544
00:31:22,041 --> 00:31:22,241
Right?

545
00:31:22,281 --> 00:31:26,003
Like, it's not about just like, like buttons clicking, it's about movement.

546
00:31:26,263 --> 00:31:27,403
It's kind of an animation thing.

547
00:31:27,563 --> 00:31:31,425
What it reminds me of is like when you play like Halo or some sci-fi game and they're

548
00:31:31,465 --> 00:31:32,406
like, here's a future car.

549
00:31:33,295 --> 00:31:35,375
And it's like, no one knows what a future car looks like,

550
00:31:35,395 --> 00:31:36,075
but that's not it.

551
00:31:36,776 --> 00:31:39,876
Likewise, like when you see the world,

552
00:31:39,896 --> 00:31:41,517
when you walk outside GDC and you look around,

553
00:31:41,557 --> 00:31:43,977
like there's really good graphic design everywhere.

554
00:31:44,658 --> 00:31:46,718
And to put that into the game,

555
00:31:46,778 --> 00:31:48,459
it's generally just like someone

556
00:31:48,479 --> 00:31:50,059
who's not a great graphic designer

557
00:31:50,099 --> 00:31:51,799
who's just sort of putting in environment art.

558
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:52,580
So.

559
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,300
If you wanna get hired forever,

560
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:56,601
get into effects, tech art, or tech animation.

561
00:31:57,501 --> 00:32:00,522
And you will, I mean, there's an incredible amount

562
00:32:00,562 --> 00:32:02,182
of demand across the entire industry for this.

563
00:32:04,659 --> 00:32:05,920
Do you guys want to answer some questions?

564
00:32:07,601 --> 00:32:08,301
Oh, yes.

565
00:32:08,321 --> 00:32:09,742
Yeah, because we're running out of time.

566
00:32:09,942 --> 00:32:12,103
Yes, but I do want to make one more point, just because I

567
00:32:12,203 --> 00:32:12,743
think it's valuable.

568
00:32:13,704 --> 00:32:16,625
Particularly with student work, what I end up seeing a lot,

569
00:32:16,665 --> 00:32:19,987
this is something to just keep in mind, oftentimes when

570
00:32:20,007 --> 00:32:22,328
you're doing student projects, you're comparing yourselves to

571
00:32:22,349 --> 00:32:24,470
your other peers in your class.

572
00:32:24,870 --> 00:32:26,591
You're not comparing yourself to the right people.

573
00:32:27,311 --> 00:32:29,955
and you're like, oh, I'm doing pretty good compared to the other people in my class,

574
00:32:30,295 --> 00:32:33,799
but you're not going out to the, you know, the poly counts or the art stations or whatever

575
00:32:33,819 --> 00:32:36,823
and comparing yourselves to the actual competition for the job you want,

576
00:32:37,163 --> 00:32:41,469
which is other people at your skill level who are killing it in, you know, kind of across the board.

577
00:32:41,809 --> 00:32:45,313
So don't fall into the trap of just looking at the two people on either side of you and going like...

578
00:32:45,702 --> 00:32:48,383
yeah, I'm doing okay, yeah, nice, like progress, you know.

579
00:32:48,624 --> 00:32:50,744
You gotta be looking at the industry as a whole

580
00:32:50,905 --> 00:32:53,346
and the quality bar and shooting for that

581
00:32:53,446 --> 00:32:56,227
rather than the kind of insular side of it.

582
00:32:56,287 --> 00:32:58,588
So just a little warning and the only reason I mention

583
00:32:58,608 --> 00:32:59,869
is because it happens all the time.

584
00:33:00,829 --> 00:33:04,270
Also, we are also talking about the industry is really small

585
00:33:04,311 --> 00:33:05,531
so be nice to those people.

586
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:09,253
Because like we, I mean, even when like

587
00:33:09,273 --> 00:33:10,433
we're all chatting on this panel,

588
00:33:10,453 --> 00:33:13,795
like we all know each other through some, you know,

589
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:14,435
connection.

590
00:33:15,283 --> 00:33:22,788
So, even if in school, you know, you are not nice, then it gets around.

591
00:33:23,049 --> 00:33:24,970
Yeah, you're never good enough to be an asshole.

592
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:25,570
Yeah.

593
00:33:25,590 --> 00:33:26,711
Yeah.

594
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:27,472
That's awesome.

595
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:27,932
Here, here.

596
00:33:33,956 --> 00:33:36,478
So, let's answer some questions, please.

597
00:33:37,671 --> 00:33:37,971
Hello.

598
00:33:38,232 --> 00:33:39,293
Hi.

599
00:33:40,795 --> 00:33:46,203
So you mentioned how you wanted the work to be shown like in game engine.

600
00:33:47,424 --> 00:33:53,352
Usually I show my work like in Substance Painter because it's re-topoed so like that's the

601
00:33:53,392 --> 00:33:55,155
whole point of showing it in engine, right?

602
00:33:55,984 --> 00:34:00,948
So like, is it okay to show it in Substance Painter, or do you still want it in Engine?

603
00:34:01,088 --> 00:34:03,730
No, it's not okay to show it in Substance Painter.

604
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:03,830
Okay.

605
00:34:03,850 --> 00:34:04,550
It has to be in Engine.

606
00:34:04,570 --> 00:34:07,792
There's a whole host of problems related to getting something to look good in Engine that

607
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:09,514
aren't applicable to looking good in Substance.

608
00:34:09,874 --> 00:34:10,775
Yeah, you have to go the whole way.

609
00:34:11,455 --> 00:34:11,735
Got it.

610
00:34:13,336 --> 00:34:18,200
Second question is, you mentioned that you should send a specific portfolio to each company,

611
00:34:19,240 --> 00:34:21,322
but how do you do that if you only have one website?

612
00:34:23,808 --> 00:34:26,330
I'm just talking about if you're making an introductory

613
00:34:26,370 --> 00:34:28,371
thing that's talking about your skills.

614
00:34:29,372 --> 00:34:32,034
I mean, admittedly, if you only have one website, fine.

615
00:34:32,554 --> 00:34:33,395
Just have your best work.

616
00:34:33,795 --> 00:34:35,736
But if you're doing something like, hey, I'm submitting a

617
00:34:35,776 --> 00:34:38,298
resume, make sure that you edit that to the kind of

618
00:34:38,318 --> 00:34:40,720
strengths that you are applicable to that job, and

619
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:42,781
then include that as a little bit of an annotation

620
00:34:42,821 --> 00:34:43,542
alongside the site.

621
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:44,923
OK, thank you.

622
00:34:47,885 --> 00:34:47,945
Hi.

623
00:34:48,575 --> 00:34:51,400
Hello, I had a question about environment modeling.

624
00:34:51,861 --> 00:34:53,584
Could you just speak a little more into the microphone?

625
00:34:53,784 --> 00:34:54,746
Hello, is that better?

626
00:34:54,986 --> 00:34:55,307
Yeah.

627
00:34:55,447 --> 00:34:55,848
That's weird.

628
00:34:56,438 --> 00:35:01,522
I had a question about, you talked about environment modeling and trying to separate yourself from the rest of the people.

629
00:35:01,582 --> 00:35:04,984
You mentioned like blockouts and post-processing and lighting.

630
00:35:05,365 --> 00:35:07,186
Can you explain a little more about the technical aspects?

631
00:35:07,226 --> 00:35:12,930
Like I'm trying to, what could I do to really learn more technical aspects?

632
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,012
Would that be like substance design and material work?

633
00:35:15,032 --> 00:35:17,074
Like what would you recommend I start doing?

634
00:35:17,634 --> 00:35:21,377
I've dove in a little bit into that, but like I'm trying to figure out how to...

635
00:35:22,372 --> 00:35:26,355
more go to technical aspects. Is that really getting into the coding? Because I'm pretty bad at that.

636
00:35:26,515 --> 00:35:31,379
So... I think, um, one of the things you can do there, uh, yeah, of course,

637
00:35:31,419 --> 00:35:34,161
substance is, is, is definitely worth, uh...

638
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,001
having in your arsenal because everybody's using it, it's the standard.

639
00:35:38,021 --> 00:35:41,722
Um, but I think that, um, you know, looking at doing modular, if I'm

640
00:35:41,782 --> 00:35:44,503
understanding your question right, like thinking through systems, like

641
00:35:44,543 --> 00:35:48,584
doing modular systems for building so that not everything is, is unique.

642
00:35:49,244 --> 00:35:54,245
Um, trying to think economically, like, like doing a modular system that

643
00:35:54,265 --> 00:35:56,225
doesn't necessarily read modularly.

644
00:35:56,946 --> 00:36:00,666
Um, that's problem solving that we're looking, that's what we're looking for.

645
00:36:00,746 --> 00:36:00,927
Right.

646
00:36:01,507 --> 00:36:03,587
Uh, cause you're, you're able to work, you know.

647
00:36:04,841 --> 00:36:09,262
more efficiently. And again, it's the problem solving aspect of it that's so crucial.

648
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:14,843
If I'm answering, I think I'm answering your question about it. Yeah, so if you don't want to get into coding and you want to do something, what can you do?

649
00:36:14,963 --> 00:36:18,504
So yeah, I would say those are like, the systems end of it is really important.

650
00:36:19,324 --> 00:36:23,425
Okay, so like the more production side, like trying to make more like modular kits and how to like,

651
00:36:24,045 --> 00:36:26,286
I guess get the most out of the time I'm working on it.

652
00:36:30,727 --> 00:36:30,907
Hi.

653
00:36:31,207 --> 00:36:31,407
Hello.

654
00:36:31,427 --> 00:36:32,148
Just a little nod.

655
00:36:32,348 --> 00:36:32,928
Hi.

656
00:36:33,128 --> 00:36:37,189
So I am a 3D artist at an automotive engineering company,

657
00:36:37,249 --> 00:36:39,149
so not Indie Games, but it's full time.

658
00:36:40,289 --> 00:36:41,790
But I would like to get into games,

659
00:36:41,990 --> 00:36:44,490
and I would like to do more stylized environments.

660
00:36:44,590 --> 00:36:48,371
So I was wondering, it's also a military contract, really.

661
00:36:48,391 --> 00:36:50,932
It's something I can't actually share or show in portfolio.

662
00:36:50,952 --> 00:36:52,652
So I was just wondering, how can I

663
00:36:52,692 --> 00:36:55,653
show skills and growth that I did there,

664
00:36:56,153 --> 00:36:58,994
while still apply it to a new resume or portfolio

665
00:36:59,054 --> 00:36:59,854
or anything like that?

666
00:37:05,256 --> 00:37:10,738
So basically you're looking to take a way more realistic portfolio, the skills that

667
00:37:10,758 --> 00:37:14,060
you learned at that job and how to put it into a stylized environment.

668
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,121
So I can't show anything.

669
00:37:15,201 --> 00:37:21,964
So I just want to know how can I voice what I did there and still say I did it without

670
00:37:22,044 --> 00:37:23,605
any real proof basically.

671
00:37:24,077 --> 00:37:28,882
Yeah, well, I mean, at the end of the day, like NDA is NDA, and you might not be able to show it.

672
00:37:28,902 --> 00:37:33,246
It's not just your situation. It would be like a lot of a lot of companies, you can't do that.

673
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:38,150
But I mean, you're already learning skills that would be like hard surface modeling that you could

674
00:37:38,551 --> 00:37:43,615
easily apply into a like a personal piece that you could show. Just unfortunately, that's probably

675
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:45,377
something you have to do on your own time that

676
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:49,138
that goes the same skills, but it would be transferable.

677
00:37:49,198 --> 00:37:52,419
You just have to take that modeling information

678
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:55,000
or knowledge that you have and then apply it

679
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:56,981
to a real-time environment.

680
00:37:57,401 --> 00:37:59,921
And I think that NDA thing is something

681
00:37:59,941 --> 00:38:02,522
we all struggle with because of the industry.

682
00:38:02,682 --> 00:38:06,903
And so keep in mind that that, like, pay attention to that

683
00:38:06,923 --> 00:38:08,324
because it really means something.

684
00:38:09,236 --> 00:38:15,102
if you violate that, people, like, we don't want you to violate it. So, and anybody that

685
00:38:15,142 --> 00:38:19,827
tells you to violate it is giving you really bad advice. But yeah, it's a personal project.

686
00:38:20,328 --> 00:38:21,069
Personal work, yeah.

687
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:28,236
So, actually, if, how would you handle doing an ART test, like, while working a 40 hour

688
00:38:28,837 --> 00:38:29,318
plus job?

689
00:38:30,553 --> 00:38:31,574
The ARC test should be reasonable.

690
00:38:31,794 --> 00:38:32,935
It shouldn't be something that...

691
00:38:33,255 --> 00:38:36,597
Yeah, also, I know Wyatt and I have talked about it before.

692
00:38:37,278 --> 00:38:41,861
So I test everybody, well not everybody that applies, but everybody that, you know, kind

693
00:38:41,921 --> 00:38:44,062
of breaks through the threshold, I guess.

694
00:38:44,142 --> 00:38:48,966
So everybody that we're interested in we test, but it's also a very reasonable test that

695
00:38:49,006 --> 00:38:51,948
should be done over like a weekend or something like that.

696
00:38:51,988 --> 00:38:52,688
It's nothing that is...

697
00:38:53,509 --> 00:38:56,911
unreasonable. And I think if somebody is testing you that is

698
00:38:56,972 --> 00:38:59,654
unreasonable, you should tell them. Maybe that's part of the

699
00:38:59,674 --> 00:39:03,697
test. Maybe they're diabolical in that way. But you should,

700
00:39:04,338 --> 00:39:06,940
you know, you should stand up for yourself for sure if it's

701
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:07,260
too much.

702
00:39:07,541 --> 00:39:08,321
Awesome. Thank you so much.

703
00:39:10,604 --> 00:39:10,784
Hi.

704
00:39:11,045 --> 00:39:11,265
Hi.

705
00:39:12,086 --> 00:39:13,988
So I'm a 2D artist and animator, and I'm

706
00:39:14,048 --> 00:39:16,791
noticing that there's a lot of division between 2D and 3D.

707
00:39:16,991 --> 00:39:20,535
And I know that the industry wants a focused, specialized

708
00:39:20,675 --> 00:39:21,456
sort of skill set.

709
00:39:22,296 --> 00:39:25,900
But is it better to kind of broaden that horizon

710
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:28,243
to get at both 2D and 3D, or just stick

711
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,244
with one side of the fence?

712
00:39:31,566 --> 00:39:39,110
I think like we have environment artists and 3d artists who are also doing their own sketches and stuff and generally it makes the art better

713
00:39:39,130 --> 00:39:42,452
And it's great if they like come to concept and we're like really busy

714
00:39:43,292 --> 00:39:46,174
So it's like the the more sort of like

715
00:39:49,635 --> 00:39:57,039
Simple questions that a 3d environment artists or a 3d modeler can solve for themselves is like a huge step up, right?

716
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:01,162
so

717
00:40:05,865 --> 00:40:09,367
So my question was and I've heard some differing opinions on this

718
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:13,689
I'm I'd like to hear what you guys have to say about it should game

719
00:40:14,150 --> 00:40:18,192
Fan art play any role in a portfolio and if it does what role should it play?

720
00:40:20,810 --> 00:40:25,972
I wrote a long spiel about this on Twitter since I've gotten a lot of jobs from fan art.

721
00:40:27,112 --> 00:40:31,833
I think you should be very careful about fan art that you put in your portfolio, and it

722
00:40:31,873 --> 00:40:35,314
should definitely play a second fiddle to your original work.

723
00:40:35,874 --> 00:40:40,635
But there are pieces of fan art that I think can speak to what you bring to the table.

724
00:40:41,096 --> 00:40:41,776
If you were just...

725
00:40:42,824 --> 00:40:49,107
drawing exactly what they're offering. If you're just drawing on model Overwatch fan art and putting it in your portfolio,

726
00:40:49,347 --> 00:40:55,650
that tells me nothing about you as an artist. But if you're doing some interesting take on something, you're improving on something,

727
00:40:55,990 --> 00:40:57,771
you're showing what you bring to the table.

728
00:40:58,192 --> 00:41:03,233
then in a way, showing that you can play around in someone else's sandbox can actually be

729
00:41:03,253 --> 00:41:05,013
a really compelling thing.

730
00:41:05,934 --> 00:41:11,335
So I don't think it's ever like a scarlet letter on someone's portfolio, but you want

731
00:41:11,355 --> 00:41:12,315
to be really thoughtful.

732
00:41:12,555 --> 00:41:15,436
In the same way that you're thoughtful about the other work you put in your portfolio,

733
00:41:15,836 --> 00:41:17,737
make sure your fan art holds up to that.

734
00:41:17,757 --> 00:41:21,058
It's not just good illustrations, it's good concept art.

735
00:41:21,883 --> 00:41:25,205
I would bring up to you, not just to try and get on Claire's good side, but

736
00:41:26,466 --> 00:41:30,568
You've done your Disney princesses before? Oh, yeah, and she also

737
00:41:30,588 --> 00:41:37,753
Did our Lutece and Elizabeth concepts for Bioshock Infinite and while that's not fan art, that's professional art

738
00:41:38,374 --> 00:41:44,357
They're all very well thought out and show like a knowledge of, you know, costume construction

739
00:41:44,437 --> 00:41:45,177
and things like that.

740
00:41:45,277 --> 00:41:50,860
So even if it was fan art, it's taking an insane amount of knowledge about that outfit

741
00:41:51,001 --> 00:41:53,422
and showing your deep understanding of it.

742
00:41:53,482 --> 00:41:58,985
So it's not just, hey, I made Tracer, you know, it's like I broke down the costume and

743
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:02,707
how it works and I'm applying that to all my personal pieces and stuff like that too.

744
00:42:02,807 --> 00:42:02,947
So.

745
00:42:03,407 --> 00:42:08,270
Yeah, when I got that job on Bioshock doing Young Liz and the Luteces, they specifically

746
00:42:08,310 --> 00:42:12,152
were like, hey, we saw your historical Disney princesses, you want to work on Bioshock?

747
00:42:12,973 --> 00:42:16,395
And I fell over and died and then took the job.

748
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:20,117
So yeah, it can definitely be a boon to your portfolio if you think about it right.

749
00:42:20,537 --> 00:42:24,259
And also, Claire, I've actually heard a bunch of these guys to comment about that, that

750
00:42:24,279 --> 00:42:30,543
it's your attention to detail from like, everything that she was wearing, you know, and I think

751
00:42:30,563 --> 00:42:31,983
that that was a really valid point too.

752
00:42:33,855 --> 00:42:35,677
Yeah, being thoughtful, right?

753
00:42:35,697 --> 00:42:35,877
Yeah.

754
00:42:37,339 --> 00:42:37,920
Thank you so much.

755
00:42:40,253 --> 00:42:40,533
Hello.

756
00:42:40,773 --> 00:42:40,933
Hi.

757
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:44,194
So my question has to do more with the beginning of the talk

758
00:42:44,234 --> 00:42:46,495
when you were talking about spamming studios.

759
00:42:46,895 --> 00:42:49,175
How do I be aggressive in my networking

760
00:42:49,255 --> 00:42:51,696
without being annoying and end up getting blacklisted

761
00:42:51,736 --> 00:42:53,797
in a very small community?

762
00:42:54,237 --> 00:42:55,497
I know that's a tricky question.

763
00:42:56,118 --> 00:42:56,478
I don't know.

764
00:42:56,498 --> 00:42:59,879
So I worked at Bungie.

765
00:43:00,079 --> 00:43:02,279
And when I finally got an interview there,

766
00:43:02,659 --> 00:43:06,060
I had this weird connection problem at the airport

767
00:43:06,140 --> 00:43:06,961
because the driver.

768
00:43:07,721 --> 00:43:11,784
couldn't call me because the cell phone I had on file was like five years old, because I've

769
00:43:11,804 --> 00:43:18,069
been spamming them for like five years or something, right? So it depends on how you do it

770
00:43:18,169 --> 00:43:22,933
and I'm sure you guys can chime in here, but, um, yeah, use your best judgment, but at a

771
00:43:22,973 --> 00:43:28,697
certain point, like there's just not a lot you can do, I think, other than try to get your sort

772
00:43:28,737 --> 00:43:29,998
of foot in the door that way.

773
00:43:30,763 --> 00:43:33,066
If I could just kind of interject with something which is,

774
00:43:33,266 --> 00:43:35,389
oftentimes it's not no, it's just not right now.

775
00:43:36,109 --> 00:43:39,974
And so I don't think anything over like a yearly cadence is

776
00:43:40,014 --> 00:43:42,537
really that useful, but there are a lot of places that

777
00:43:42,577 --> 00:43:44,779
actually love to see the same people come back over and over

778
00:43:44,819 --> 00:43:45,039
again.

779
00:43:45,460 --> 00:43:49,321
and if you can see some progression there. Plus it shows a little bit of passion for

780
00:43:49,341 --> 00:43:52,781
that person toward your particular company. Like I don't just want to work at any game

781
00:43:52,821 --> 00:43:55,722
company, I want to work at yours because I like what you do and your vision. I think

782
00:43:55,742 --> 00:43:59,643
that's healthy. So I don't think you have to go out of your way to push hard, just send

783
00:43:59,663 --> 00:44:04,204
the pings, send them off every once in a while and show some consistency there and some humility

784
00:44:04,244 --> 00:44:06,005
about it. I think that can be healthy.

785
00:44:06,325 --> 00:44:10,448
Yeah, and also try to find out who the art director is and that sort of thing, you know?

786
00:44:10,609 --> 00:44:15,273
I originally got an interview at 343 doing the same thing with Kenneth Scott, who was

787
00:44:15,293 --> 00:44:16,033
the art director then.

788
00:44:17,034 --> 00:44:20,057
And the same at Bungie, it was the same approach.

789
00:44:20,197 --> 00:44:24,401
I just didn't spam them all the time, I just spammed them once or twice, went away for

790
00:44:24,481 --> 00:44:27,944
five years, spammed them again, and then it worked out.

791
00:44:28,785 --> 00:44:30,126
So I would add to that.

792
00:44:31,833 --> 00:44:35,437
you spam or ping a company, show difference in your portfolio.

793
00:44:35,638 --> 00:44:38,601
So it becomes spam when it's the exact same thing.

794
00:44:38,661 --> 00:44:40,303
And you're just like, hey, remember me, remember me.

795
00:44:40,863 --> 00:44:42,605
We probably remember you.

796
00:44:42,966 --> 00:44:44,928
And it's like a not right now, but it was not right now

797
00:44:45,008 --> 00:44:46,009
based on that portfolio.

798
00:44:46,350 --> 00:44:48,512
So if you improve your portfolio,

799
00:44:48,652 --> 00:44:50,675
maybe that's a good time to connect again.

800
00:44:52,029 --> 00:44:53,769
Rejection letters are never personal.

801
00:44:54,030 --> 00:44:56,150
I mean, it's, and they're most likely the person

802
00:44:56,370 --> 00:44:57,430
may have forgotten anyway.

803
00:44:57,450 --> 00:45:01,651
So it doesn't hurt to send another time.

804
00:45:02,851 --> 00:45:04,032
I'm still trying to figure out

805
00:45:04,192 --> 00:45:05,732
how they let you get away for five years.

806
00:45:05,832 --> 00:45:08,993
Like, I think you, yeah.

807
00:45:09,053 --> 00:45:10,333
It was a later thing, right?

808
00:45:10,453 --> 00:45:10,673
Yeah.

809
00:45:10,733 --> 00:45:11,353
Come back later.

810
00:45:11,393 --> 00:45:13,214
But I think that's, I mean, again,

811
00:45:13,234 --> 00:45:15,514
just going back to like the rejection letter thing,

812
00:45:15,534 --> 00:45:17,975
like y'all are looking for your jobs.

813
00:45:17,995 --> 00:45:18,175
I mean,

814
00:45:18,995 --> 00:45:24,818
You've seen Darren's work, it's amazing, and it took you five years, you know, like paying these guys sometimes.

815
00:45:24,858 --> 00:45:26,218
Yeah, and I kept improving.

816
00:45:26,718 --> 00:45:30,720
So, I mean, it's just a, if you're just starting your career, that's something to really think about.

817
00:45:31,121 --> 00:45:37,184
Or Wyeth and Greg, both of you guys have seen some people's portfolios for the last couple years

818
00:45:37,244 --> 00:45:41,606
and have seen their progression get better and better, and they request to see these guys,

819
00:45:41,806 --> 00:45:44,507
and I think that also forming that connection helps as well.

820
00:45:44,892 --> 00:45:47,535
Yeah, we've had people who came back, because this is like, what, seventh or eighth year

821
00:45:47,555 --> 00:45:48,136
we've been doing this?

822
00:45:48,557 --> 00:45:52,723
People who come back a couple of years in a row, ask for one of us in particular, and

823
00:45:52,743 --> 00:45:55,847
then following year we don't see that person, and then we'll get a nice email like, hey,

824
00:45:55,867 --> 00:45:56,247
I got hired.

825
00:45:57,469 --> 00:46:01,615
So just to share like a small success story or whatever.

826
00:46:03,023 --> 00:46:08,086
So I had reviewed the portfolio of an artist named Colton Orr last year.

827
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:13,069
He actually applied to my team this year, remembered his portfolio.

828
00:46:13,209 --> 00:46:16,271
He went through the usual paces and we hired him.

829
00:46:16,311 --> 00:46:17,432
So he's just joined our team.

830
00:46:18,132 --> 00:46:21,054
And I mean, it's kind of hitting that connection, right?

831
00:46:21,094 --> 00:46:25,076
So we reviewed his portfolio, gave him advice on this, this, and this.

832
00:46:25,396 --> 00:46:30,159
He listened to it, he executed, and that progress was noticeable for sure.

833
00:46:31,612 --> 00:46:32,253
Thank you for your time.

834
00:46:43,695 --> 00:46:49,858
I had a question about what would your thoughts be on portfolios that feature multiple mediums?

835
00:46:50,578 --> 00:46:56,901
So like if you had a character or some kind of structure that you had conventioned into

836
00:46:57,681 --> 00:47:02,083
maybe a model figure or a toy or you even made a costume out of a character you made,

837
00:47:02,823 --> 00:47:04,484
what are your thoughts on featuring something like that?

838
00:47:08,988 --> 00:47:10,908
I don't think that has much business being in a portfolio,

839
00:47:10,928 --> 00:47:11,988
honestly, if it were me.

840
00:47:12,008 --> 00:47:14,929
I want to see the stuff that's directly applicable to the job

841
00:47:15,009 --> 00:47:16,289
that we're hiring you to do.

842
00:47:17,089 --> 00:47:18,570
I think that's the perfect kind of thing if you want to

843
00:47:18,610 --> 00:47:20,030
put it in your personal blog.

844
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,170
If I want to learn more about you, if I've seen your

845
00:47:22,450 --> 00:47:24,631
expectations for what you think your best work is, maybe

846
00:47:24,651 --> 00:47:25,551
I'll go to your personal blog.

847
00:47:25,571 --> 00:47:26,211
In fact, I will.

848
00:47:26,291 --> 00:47:28,211
And I will go to your Twitter, and I will find your Facebook,

849
00:47:28,231 --> 00:47:30,492
and I will find your postings on Polycount, and I will find

850
00:47:30,512 --> 00:47:32,512
all the things on the internet to make sure you're not an

851
00:47:32,592 --> 00:47:32,932
asshole.

852
00:47:33,712 --> 00:47:34,573
That's definitely what we're going to do.

853
00:47:35,813 --> 00:47:38,474
But that's a perfect thing to show as supplemental work.

854
00:47:38,974 --> 00:47:41,254
But I don't think, for me, that that has much business

855
00:47:41,294 --> 00:47:41,995
being in a portfolio.

856
00:47:42,055 --> 00:47:44,455
Yeah, I hide that stuff.

857
00:47:44,835 --> 00:47:50,297
Like I've done product design work and theme park work.

858
00:47:51,477 --> 00:47:53,858
And I'll do random stuff here and there.

859
00:47:54,138 --> 00:47:56,959
And I generally do not post it anywhere.

860
00:47:57,199 --> 00:48:00,120
Because I'm sort of trying to, what I'm putting out there is

861
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:01,240
sort of like the brand.

862
00:48:01,300 --> 00:48:03,421
And I don't really want to dilute that with anything

863
00:48:03,481 --> 00:48:03,601
else.

864
00:48:07,988 --> 00:48:08,668
I see, thank you.

865
00:48:08,728 --> 00:48:08,788
Hi.

866
00:48:08,808 --> 00:48:09,669
Hello, I'm Max.

867
00:48:10,309 --> 00:48:12,930
First off, I'd like to thank you guys for just like talking,

868
00:48:12,970 --> 00:48:14,731
give all this valuable information.

869
00:48:14,791 --> 00:48:17,472
But my main question is,

870
00:48:18,192 --> 00:48:19,813
as you guys kind of mentioned earlier,

871
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:22,995
the emerging job of technical artists.

872
00:48:24,295 --> 00:48:25,296
My main question is,

873
00:48:25,656 --> 00:48:29,077
is there like a global definition of technical artists?

874
00:48:29,718 --> 00:48:32,179
Or is it more defined by like specifically

875
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:34,060
what your companies need?

876
00:48:34,899 --> 00:48:36,721
I'll take that because that's what I do all day.

877
00:48:38,022 --> 00:48:38,623
No, there isn't.

878
00:48:38,863 --> 00:48:42,026
And actually, there's a strange schism between even the phrase.

879
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:45,570
There are companies who call tech artists tech animators.

880
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:48,974
And there are ones who call the tech animators tech animators

881
00:48:49,014 --> 00:48:50,095
and tech artists tech artists.

882
00:48:50,135 --> 00:48:51,977
And then there are tech artists who make shaders.

883
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:53,298
There are ones who write code.

884
00:48:53,658 --> 00:48:58,301
There are ones who write pipeline like Python scripts and ingesting data in and out of GCC packages.

885
00:48:59,382 --> 00:49:00,942
There are tech artists who do visual effects.

886
00:49:01,763 --> 00:49:06,405
There is absolutely no definition in this space other than I would say you have to have good taste

887
00:49:06,946 --> 00:49:09,747
and you can't be afraid of the technical side of problems.

888
00:49:10,207 --> 00:49:13,250
So if I just wanted to give a broad, generic definition,

889
00:49:13,450 --> 00:49:15,872
which isn't that particularly helpful, it would be that.

890
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:19,435
What I do all day is I make visual effects, I write

891
00:49:19,475 --> 00:49:21,076
shaders, and I do aesthetic stuff.

892
00:49:21,096 --> 00:49:24,639
Like I'll do lighting, or I'll do whatever it takes to make

893
00:49:24,699 --> 00:49:27,021
something look better, to try to push it from 90 to 100.

894
00:49:27,422 --> 00:49:29,283
That's kind of like my role, basically.

895
00:49:29,964 --> 00:49:34,810
Um, and so while there isn't a specific definition, I think if you learn shaders, you learn some

896
00:49:34,830 --> 00:49:38,975
effects, don't be scared of code, dabble in some HLSL and make sure you have good taste,

897
00:49:39,276 --> 00:49:40,858
that's a pretty good start to tech art.

898
00:49:42,858 --> 00:49:49,440
Awesome, so is it more like, so then you can incorporate, you know, programming into like

899
00:49:49,700 --> 00:49:54,221
artistic, like if you're putting models and stuff on your portfolio, you can show that

900
00:49:54,261 --> 00:49:58,122
you can incorporate like blueprints, like in Unreal, and kind of get them to do other

901
00:49:58,142 --> 00:49:58,262
things?

902
00:49:58,282 --> 00:50:01,383
Or write a really cool shader to do something interesting, like a non-traditional shading

903
00:50:01,423 --> 00:50:02,624
model, something.

904
00:50:02,784 --> 00:50:06,044
Or like a tool, like having, you know, some kind of...

905
00:50:07,165 --> 00:50:11,867
modeling supplement or something like that for the team is also an example. So it kind of depends,

906
00:50:12,487 --> 00:50:17,569
you know, like what I was saying. I mean, at Insomniac we have shader artists, technical

907
00:50:17,629 --> 00:50:24,332
artists and technical director which is technically a rigger. So they will do tools based on

908
00:50:24,452 --> 00:50:29,795
rigs. Our technical artists do tools. They're really more the mediator between art and

909
00:50:29,835 --> 00:50:31,155
programming. Like they're the people.

910
00:50:31,616 --> 00:50:36,842
Smart enough to understand what programming saying but have an eye for art so they can talk to a caveman like me

911
00:50:38,143 --> 00:50:43,970
So they're kind of like the force multiplier in that way and then with like shader artists. It's now it's

912
00:50:44,571 --> 00:50:47,074
Substance it's a lot of substance designer for sure

913
00:50:47,895 --> 00:50:50,558
Awesome. Thank you very much that that helps a lot. Thank you

914
00:50:51,325 --> 00:50:52,686
Just a couple comments.

915
00:50:53,547 --> 00:50:56,170
You will be receiving an email about our talk.

916
00:50:56,811 --> 00:51:00,135
Please give us a good review so that we can come back here

917
00:51:00,175 --> 00:51:02,157
next year and talk to all you guys again.

918
00:51:03,073 --> 00:51:05,495
If we get enough good reviews, will we get a bigger room?

919
00:51:06,336 --> 00:51:07,157
I know, we need a...

920
00:51:07,477 --> 00:51:08,719
We will fix that, I promise.

921
00:51:08,759 --> 00:51:09,880
We will be fixing that.

922
00:51:11,522 --> 00:51:16,006
And also, I feel, I apologize to this side of the room,

923
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:17,868
since it's been all on this side.

924
00:51:18,389 --> 00:51:19,850
We're looking at you in spirit.

925
00:51:20,090 --> 00:51:20,651
Hi, guys.

926
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:32,003
One thing that you guys talked about earlier that intrigued me was talking about having a second strong skill set.

927
00:51:32,163 --> 00:51:36,066
The example you said was an animator with cinematic skills.

928
00:51:36,786 --> 00:51:44,372
So what role would, say like a short film or like a music video, would those kind of show the cinematic skills?

929
00:51:44,732 --> 00:51:48,715
Or is that not really applicable because it's not in the game industry?

930
00:51:49,493 --> 00:51:54,074
I think I'd probably rather see it in the context of your animation, like your animation

931
00:51:54,675 --> 00:52:01,037
with that, because you were talking about video editing or composition, like cinematography

932
00:52:01,057 --> 00:52:01,317
like that.

933
00:52:01,737 --> 00:52:05,999
Yeah, I think I'd rather, I mean, it would kind of translate, but I'd rather see it like,

934
00:52:06,039 --> 00:52:11,301
hey, I animated this thing and I made this really cool shot to go along with it, like

935
00:52:13,201 --> 00:52:15,342
you know, like an action cam kind of thing.

936
00:52:15,362 --> 00:52:15,402
So.

937
00:52:18,167 --> 00:52:22,933
So the camera enhancing the animation experience.

938
00:52:23,113 --> 00:52:26,998
So I don't know that a music video or something would really tell me that.

939
00:52:27,579 --> 00:52:28,580
But, yeah.

940
00:52:30,042 --> 00:52:30,583
It's risky.

941
00:52:31,144 --> 00:52:31,424
Yeah.

942
00:52:32,125 --> 00:52:35,790
I think you can, like, if you just focus on your main, like, I don't know, like...

943
00:52:35,984 --> 00:52:39,948
If you focus on like your main discipline, right, and you think about what story you're

944
00:52:39,968 --> 00:52:45,615
trying to tell with that piece, I think if you continue down that path and see what you

945
00:52:45,635 --> 00:52:50,400
can do to plus it, that's what will give you like the secondary skill, right?

946
00:52:50,420 --> 00:52:52,843
So if it's environment, it would be like, well.

947
00:52:53,283 --> 00:52:59,065
what story am I telling with this piece and then modeling it out, doing it like in a modular way,

948
00:52:59,165 --> 00:53:03,826
like using like substance, creating all that content, lighting it, telling a story with the

949
00:53:03,886 --> 00:53:08,467
character art, maybe it's adding like blend shapes and things like that to kind of show more emotion

950
00:53:08,627 --> 00:53:14,089
in your character with animation. You know you could be making, make a film in Unreal,

951
00:53:14,589 --> 00:53:21,451
which is free, you can get it anytime. But things like that, you could do a video in a game engine

952
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:22,311
that isn't...

953
00:53:22,910 --> 00:53:28,314
you're not editing video in like whatever, after effects or something like that. But having all of

954
00:53:28,374 --> 00:53:32,337
that in Unreal that's more context, you're not just animating, you're actually, now you're

955
00:53:32,357 --> 00:53:36,020
telling a story, you're doing your own cinematic and, you know, you're increasing what you

956
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:37,301
already were doing, you know?

957
00:53:37,602 --> 00:53:42,045
Yeah, like take, take your, take your walk cycle instead of just, you know, guy walking

958
00:53:42,065 --> 00:53:46,289
three quarters at me looping, do that and then show me something with a dynamic camera,

959
00:53:46,669 --> 00:53:50,292
right? Like it's just plussing what you already have. You don't have to do a whole other

960
00:53:50,352 --> 00:53:52,273
thing, it's like enhancing it.

961
00:53:54,309 --> 00:53:54,869
Thank you very much.

962
00:53:58,852 --> 00:53:59,133
Hello.

963
00:53:59,453 --> 00:53:59,613
Hi.

964
00:54:00,053 --> 00:54:03,616
I'm preparing a portfolio piece for TechHeart.

965
00:54:04,277 --> 00:54:13,344
And my question is that because TechHeart is so diverse, so I'm debating on...

966
00:54:15,909 --> 00:54:21,815
Should I focus on just one specific area like rigging?

967
00:54:22,516 --> 00:54:26,521
Or should I just show that I have know-hows

968
00:54:26,541 --> 00:54:28,343
in every dimension in general?

969
00:54:28,627 --> 00:54:29,548
Yeah, it's a tough one.

970
00:54:30,348 --> 00:54:32,930
At some point, you're going to have to realize that a company

971
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:35,632
is also going to have to be compatible with you, and not

972
00:54:35,692 --> 00:54:37,654
just with the scatter shot broad approach.

973
00:54:38,074 --> 00:54:40,856
I would rather show someone's show really peak excellence in

974
00:54:41,056 --> 00:54:44,238
a technical area, and also show some ancillary knowledge

975
00:54:44,278 --> 00:54:48,061
around that area, like Python, or like HLSL, or like really

976
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,763
nice shader work that's visual and beautiful and shows

977
00:54:50,803 --> 00:54:51,283
complexity.

978
00:54:52,604 --> 00:54:56,166
So, I think when you're starting out, I'd rather see you get good at something very

979
00:54:56,186 --> 00:55:00,809
specific and show mastery there and then express a little bit of ancillary mastery around that

980
00:55:01,130 --> 00:55:04,552
and then you're just going to have to wait for the company that matches well with needing

981
00:55:04,612 --> 00:55:05,493
that part of you.

982
00:55:05,873 --> 00:55:08,975
I think it's going to take you a long time to get really, really good at a really broad

983
00:55:08,995 --> 00:55:10,716
array of things and have a portfolio like that.

984
00:55:11,116 --> 00:55:12,317
So that's not where I would start.

985
00:55:13,618 --> 00:55:13,958
Phil or me.

986
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:14,839
Thank you.

987
00:55:14,859 --> 00:55:15,800
I appreciate your answer.

988
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:26,308
Hi, I'm wondering if there is a tasteful way to sort of show a time frame in which you worked on a portfolio piece.

989
00:55:28,230 --> 00:55:31,073
Like maybe game jams or time lapses or something like that.

990
00:55:31,474 --> 00:55:34,377
I guess in my opinion the time doesn't really matter, it would be the quality.

991
00:55:36,305 --> 00:55:41,207
And I know, like, it's kind of common to be proud of how fast, like, a turnaround time was. But

992
00:55:41,727 --> 00:55:45,729
honestly, man, if it's bad, it's bad. It doesn't matter how long it took. And if it's good, it's

993
00:55:45,749 --> 00:55:53,231
good. Things like speed, turnaround time, shortcuts, workflow, I can teach you that. But it just needs

994
00:55:53,251 --> 00:55:57,412
to be good. We're already going to learn that from you with the test, which we're inevitably

995
00:55:57,432 --> 00:56:00,233
going to give you. The test is already going to tell us that. All right. Thank you.

996
00:56:02,647 --> 00:56:08,412
Hi, I was wondering, so everyone says you should have your best piece first in your portfolio,

997
00:56:08,832 --> 00:56:12,275
but what if your best piece is not one of your most recent?

998
00:56:13,456 --> 00:56:16,158
Does that reflect badly on you?

999
00:56:18,051 --> 00:56:23,394
No, I don't really, I don't worry about your portfolio necessarily being chronological

1000
00:56:23,434 --> 00:56:23,935
in any way.

1001
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:24,735
Okay.

1002
00:56:24,755 --> 00:56:29,598
Some of my favorite pieces are a couple years old and very jealous of past me.

1003
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:35,542
But that's still work you've done and it's, you know, in recent enough memory I think

1004
00:56:35,562 --> 00:56:39,064
that's totally fine to structure your portfolio as strongly as possible.

1005
00:56:39,385 --> 00:56:40,165
Okay, thank you.

1006
00:56:43,728 --> 00:56:51,233
Hey guys, I'm Andrea, so I'm a final year student majoring in games art and specialized environment art.

1007
00:56:51,774 --> 00:56:52,814
So I want to

1008
00:56:52,834 --> 00:56:58,678
My question is, is personal branding important and also

1009
00:56:59,118 --> 00:57:01,340
presenting your work, so like

1010
00:57:02,701 --> 00:57:05,723
getting screenshots from a game engine, especially like

1011
00:57:07,479 --> 00:57:10,282
kind of like a shooting camera.

1012
00:57:10,443 --> 00:57:12,745
It should be like something like more cinematic,

1013
00:57:12,825 --> 00:57:20,234
so inspired by movies or more like game related,

1014
00:57:20,354 --> 00:57:26,321
so mostly like first person view or third person, so.

1015
00:57:32,778 --> 00:57:38,760
I mean, it's a tough one because some of this comes down to the company you're applying

1016
00:57:38,800 --> 00:57:39,040
for.

1017
00:57:39,781 --> 00:57:41,421
So, just know your strength.

1018
00:57:41,621 --> 00:57:44,242
This is one of those areas where we're not going to be able to tell you what's right

1019
00:57:44,262 --> 00:57:45,263
because we don't know what you're good at.

1020
00:57:46,483 --> 00:57:49,624
When in doubt and the options are wide, pick one thing.

1021
00:57:50,505 --> 00:57:54,329
So if there is a lot of context and you're like, I could go anywhere, I could do anything,

1022
00:57:54,609 --> 00:57:58,733
that means you just haven't kind of settled in yet and we don't actually want to see those decisions

1023
00:57:58,813 --> 00:58:02,637
happening in your portfolio. We don't want to see the schizophrenia of the decisions.

1024
00:58:03,417 --> 00:58:07,562
Pick something and show some kind of apex decisions in that area.

1025
00:58:07,602 --> 00:58:10,544
And we actually don't care what you pick, just be good at something and that's where you start.

1026
00:58:11,144 --> 00:58:14,227
Okay, now just thinking about how you present your work,

1027
00:58:14,867 --> 00:58:18,270
is that like a bad way to present your work?

1028
00:58:18,490 --> 00:58:21,292
Or like, it's like, it doesn't really matter,

1029
00:58:21,352 --> 00:58:24,255
like, yeah, just, I like this angle,

1030
00:58:24,515 --> 00:58:26,316
yeah, is that composition is okay?

1031
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,138
I just take a screen and like, yeah.

1032
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:29,659
We'd rather just see that you have good taste.

1033
00:58:30,540 --> 00:58:32,021
So it's not really about that decision,

1034
00:58:32,061 --> 00:58:34,123
it's about doing something aesthetically pleasing.

1035
00:58:34,443 --> 00:58:36,705
It's not really about the presentation per se,

1036
00:58:37,566 --> 00:58:38,066
in that regard.

1037
00:58:38,306 --> 00:58:39,407
Maybe like look for reference.

1038
00:58:40,035 --> 00:58:41,036
Yeah, that's a good point.

1039
00:58:41,156 --> 00:58:42,517
OK, thank you.

1040
00:58:44,338 --> 00:58:45,619
Thank you for a great advice, guys.

1041
00:58:46,219 --> 00:58:48,621
I have a question regarding using specific software

1042
00:58:48,661 --> 00:58:49,321
to create art.

1043
00:58:49,922 --> 00:58:51,843
So basically, you can use whatever program

1044
00:58:51,863 --> 00:58:54,905
is in the market right now, like Photoshop, Gimp, or Paint,

1045
00:58:54,945 --> 00:58:55,685
if you're desperate.

1046
00:58:56,346 --> 00:59:00,768
Or basically, you can model in Maya and animate in 3D Max.

1047
00:59:01,169 --> 00:59:02,990
So basically, does it make sense to apply

1048
00:59:03,050 --> 00:59:05,631
for a Maya-specific company if you're using

1049
00:59:05,651 --> 00:59:06,952
3D Max for most of your work?

1050
00:59:10,912 --> 00:59:13,094
I don't really care what you're...

1051
00:59:21,385 --> 00:59:25,167
All of our guys have made a shift at one point or another,

1052
00:59:25,187 --> 00:59:26,628
whether it's animators going to Maya.

1053
00:59:28,128 --> 00:59:30,629
Some of our modelers now going from Max to Maya.

1054
00:59:31,890 --> 00:59:34,611
If you understand one and you're good at it,

1055
00:59:34,671 --> 00:59:36,532
you'll be able to, we're usually reasonably confident

1056
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:37,612
we'll be able to figure out the other one.

1057
00:59:37,992 --> 00:59:39,893
And honestly, I don't really care, again,

1058
00:59:40,033 --> 00:59:41,814
because it now comes down to what's in the game.

1059
00:59:42,274 --> 00:59:45,055
Whatever gets me to the game model, I don't really care.

1060
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:46,916
So, I mean, we're pretty.

1061
00:59:47,737 --> 00:59:49,939
I think a lot of us are pretty flexible about what your

1062
00:59:50,019 --> 00:59:51,220
authoring tool is.

1063
00:59:51,240 --> 00:59:52,842
It doesn't really matter anymore.

1064
00:59:53,302 --> 00:59:53,523
Yeah.

1065
00:59:53,643 --> 00:59:55,505
So thank you.

1066
00:59:56,169 --> 01:00:00,252
Uh, I mean for me personally I've gone from like Lightwave to Exocyte to Max to Maya to Max to

1067
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:08,919
Maya, now Max and Maya again. Uh, all of my team they use whatever they want, Max, Modo, Maya, uh,

1068
01:00:08,999 --> 01:00:13,583
but in the end it'll just all go into the game engine so it's you, as long as you show that

1069
01:00:13,663 --> 01:00:18,627
knowledge of putting something into a game engine, like the real time aspect of it, that's all

1070
01:00:18,647 --> 01:00:23,951
that matters to me and we can work, we've worked our pipeline to accept, it's agnostic, it can

1071
01:00:23,992 --> 01:00:24,732
take whatever, right?

1072
01:00:25,341 --> 01:00:31,704
Uh, something like substance is just really more of the, you know, pack leader in that way. But

1073
01:00:32,044 --> 01:00:36,786
what you really need to know is like PBR. You need to know like real time shaders and how to

1074
01:00:36,826 --> 01:00:42,708
properly create textures for, you know, modern engines, right? So, uh, it's not, you can do that

1075
01:00:42,728 --> 01:00:45,630
in Photoshop if you want. You might be able to make paint.

1076
01:00:46,331 --> 01:00:49,815
you might be able to do it in paint, I don't know. But uh, but

1077
01:00:49,955 --> 01:00:54,180
it's the knowledge that matters more than whatever software logo

1078
01:00:54,220 --> 01:00:56,723
is on your art station. You know what I mean? Cool, thank you

1079
01:00:56,763 --> 01:00:57,123
very much.

1080
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,780
Hi, thank you so much for the talk.

1081
01:01:02,981 --> 01:01:07,263
You mentioned earlier that you would look through people's social media after they piqued

1082
01:01:07,283 --> 01:01:09,364
your interest to see if they're not an ass.

1083
01:01:11,545 --> 01:01:17,087
Would you be suspicious if you looked up someone and saw that they didn't really use Twitter

1084
01:01:17,147 --> 01:01:18,007
or Facebook very much?

1085
01:01:18,047 --> 01:01:18,968
Would that be a red flag?

1086
01:01:19,308 --> 01:01:19,888
No, not at all.

1087
01:01:20,228 --> 01:01:21,309
Okay, thank God.

1088
01:01:24,390 --> 01:01:25,030
Well now I am.

1089
01:01:27,963 --> 01:01:28,566
Get his name.

1090
01:01:28,586 --> 01:01:28,666
Yeah.

1091
01:01:29,068 --> 01:01:29,811
Ha ha ha.

1092
01:01:31,558 --> 01:01:33,526
Hey, thank you very much, guys.
