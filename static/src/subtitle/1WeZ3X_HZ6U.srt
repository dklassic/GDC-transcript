1
00:00:05,171 --> 00:00:08,012
Okay, thank you all for coming.

2
00:00:08,032 --> 00:00:09,873
It's final day of GDC.

3
00:00:09,893 --> 00:00:11,893
I hope you all had a great week.

4
00:00:12,734 --> 00:00:16,435
And before I start, I want to remind you

5
00:00:16,595 --> 00:00:20,017
to turn off your cell phones and would very appreciate

6
00:00:20,057 --> 00:00:24,998
if you can fill out the questionnaire after the talk.

7
00:00:26,268 --> 00:00:29,449
So if you don't know how to pronounce my name,

8
00:00:29,509 --> 00:00:31,550
you can just call me Johnson, it's close enough.

9
00:00:32,271 --> 00:00:33,852
I am not a native English speaker,

10
00:00:33,912 --> 00:00:36,393
so my English may be wrong sometimes,

11
00:00:36,473 --> 00:00:39,354
but still I hope I can get most of the points across.

12
00:00:41,435 --> 00:00:43,316
I'm actually a programmer, but in recent years

13
00:00:43,416 --> 00:00:47,298
I run an indie dev meetup called IGD Share in Taiwan.

14
00:00:47,318 --> 00:00:49,679
I also run IGD Taiwan chapter

15
00:00:49,839 --> 00:00:52,541
and co-organize Taipei Game Developers Forum since 2012.

16
00:00:54,156 --> 00:00:56,058
But more importantly regarding this talk,

17
00:00:56,458 --> 00:00:58,880
I was on the translation team for the official

18
00:00:59,721 --> 00:01:01,963
traditional Chinese subtitle for Indie Game Movie.

19
00:01:02,763 --> 00:01:05,426
But Netflix recently messed up our work.

20
00:01:05,766 --> 00:01:06,727
I will talk about this later.

21
00:01:08,148 --> 00:01:11,711
So I also worked on some of the indie game localizations

22
00:01:11,731 --> 00:01:13,353
such as Nova 111 and Tengami.

23
00:01:14,466 --> 00:01:19,950
I help Global Game Jam as the Asia regional organizer and the traditional Chinese translation volunteer.

24
00:01:20,810 --> 00:01:25,854
And I also roughly do the same translation volunteer thing for Indicate Festival.

25
00:01:27,315 --> 00:01:33,018
So let's just start with this very famous image. I think you've all seen this before.

26
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:36,543
or your base belong to us.

27
00:01:37,124 --> 00:01:39,145
Suffice to say, I'm trying to help stopping

28
00:01:39,205 --> 00:01:40,366
the opposite case of this.

29
00:01:41,147 --> 00:01:43,388
Because from my personal experience in the past,

30
00:01:43,508 --> 00:01:46,010
at times I wish I could have helped people

31
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:49,132
fix their Chinese localization issues.

32
00:01:50,353 --> 00:01:52,695
Gaming is a global community now and

33
00:01:54,024 --> 00:01:57,566
Not just the players in the US will see crappy or funny localizations like this.

34
00:01:57,947 --> 00:02:03,630
A lot of games now are being localized into fast-growing, non-English-speaking markets,

35
00:02:03,730 --> 00:02:07,733
especially in Asia where China and Taiwan play a bigger factor.

36
00:02:08,457 --> 00:02:13,900
So let's check out some of the questionable Chinese localizations here that we have been exposed to in the past.

37
00:02:14,581 --> 00:02:19,923
So this example is the traditional Chinese version of Neverwinter Nights.

38
00:02:21,124 --> 00:02:26,107
Just by looking at a screenshot here, even if you don't know Chinese, you can still tell there's something wrong.

39
00:02:26,547 --> 00:02:32,550
The dialect options are obviously duplicated, and there are strange numbers between the sentences.

40
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:36,231
But the most iconic thing in this particular screenshot

41
00:02:36,572 --> 00:02:38,492
is that the last part of the dialogue

42
00:02:38,672 --> 00:02:40,593
reads like this in English originally.

43
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:44,135
So it's, I tried to grab her hand,

44
00:02:44,755 --> 00:02:45,655
her being an old woman,

45
00:02:46,375 --> 00:02:48,496
but she gave me a kick in the teeth.

46
00:02:49,317 --> 00:02:51,137
So this kick in the teeth, as far as I know,

47
00:02:51,277 --> 00:02:54,058
is an idiom meaning that treating you badly

48
00:02:54,198 --> 00:02:55,259
when you are in need.

49
00:02:56,179 --> 00:02:59,020
But the traditional Chinese version mistranslated that into

50
00:03:00,341 --> 00:03:02,102
literally a woman that kicks your teeth.

51
00:03:03,057 --> 00:03:04,898
So there are hundreds of things like this

52
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,980
in the traditional Chinese version of Neverwinter Nights,

53
00:03:07,181 --> 00:03:09,183
and this being the most funny and notable one.

54
00:03:09,223 --> 00:03:11,725
As a result, Tease-Kicking Old Woman

55
00:03:11,945 --> 00:03:14,748
sort of became the nickname for Neverwinter Nights in Taiwan.

56
00:03:17,611 --> 00:03:19,212
So you definitely don't want your localization

57
00:03:19,272 --> 00:03:19,913
end up like that.

58
00:03:21,995 --> 00:03:24,777
I'm going to show you some more background information

59
00:03:24,817 --> 00:03:26,639
and the context of this talk, and then...

60
00:03:28,130 --> 00:03:29,931
Lots of examples grouped by categories,

61
00:03:29,951 --> 00:03:32,452
you know, general idea and also like

62
00:03:32,572 --> 00:03:34,133
simplified vs traditional things,

63
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,434
naming and encoding, UI, phones,

64
00:03:37,874 --> 00:03:39,975
and lastly a little bit political stuff.

65
00:03:40,956 --> 00:03:43,937
And then finally some tips and conclusions

66
00:03:43,977 --> 00:03:44,838
that you can take away.

67
00:03:46,298 --> 00:03:49,260
So let's look at this from a practical point of view first.

68
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,961
China's market share is huge and growing fast.

69
00:03:52,161 --> 00:03:54,442
And Taiwan, although small in land mass,

70
00:03:54,582 --> 00:03:57,083
but still the number six on this chart.

71
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:00,172
And if you look at the chart carefully,

72
00:04:00,192 --> 00:04:03,253
you also notice that China has only one color in the bar,

73
00:04:03,373 --> 00:04:06,175
simply because the chart maker couldn't track down numbers

74
00:04:06,255 --> 00:04:08,316
from Android-related markets in China.

75
00:04:10,597 --> 00:04:12,918
And this is the year-over-year growth.

76
00:04:13,138 --> 00:04:14,639
Both China and Taiwan is in top five,

77
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:17,140
although again, at a Google Play's part,

78
00:04:18,220 --> 00:04:19,621
they couldn't track down number for China.

79
00:04:22,096 --> 00:04:25,679
And in addition to that, Taiwan is also an important

80
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:28,582
soft launching region for a lot of developers,

81
00:04:29,083 --> 00:04:30,304
if the game type is suitable.

82
00:04:31,065 --> 00:04:33,907
It's similar to Australia or New Zealand for the US market.

83
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:36,290
So if you want to eventually go to Japan or China,

84
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:39,112
chances are that you might want to soft launch in Taiwan

85
00:04:39,573 --> 00:04:41,214
and see your result and performance this year.

86
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,497
So these are probably the more convincing

87
00:04:43,557 --> 00:04:45,619
and practical reasons why you want to treat

88
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,420
the Chinese localization more seriously.

89
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:52,003
Now after we've established some reasons

90
00:04:52,023 --> 00:04:52,784
you might want to do this,

91
00:04:52,804 --> 00:04:54,444
let's start to talk about different aspects

92
00:04:54,485 --> 00:04:55,605
of Chinese localization.

93
00:04:57,266 --> 00:04:59,087
I would assume you probably already know this

94
00:04:59,647 --> 00:05:02,128
simplified VS traditional stuff.

95
00:05:03,309 --> 00:05:08,011
But in Chinese, things are definitely vastly more different

96
00:05:08,031 --> 00:05:08,631
than you would think.

97
00:05:09,932 --> 00:05:11,793
So this table shows the National Language Service

98
00:05:11,853 --> 00:05:16,115
description in Windows for the various Chinese systems.

99
00:05:16,775 --> 00:05:18,996
As you can see, it's very confusing to say the least.

100
00:05:19,893 --> 00:05:22,234
Not to mention the spoken language differences

101
00:05:22,294 --> 00:05:24,255
such as Mandarin and Cantonese,

102
00:05:24,755 --> 00:05:27,316
and you know, you still have to deal with all the UI

103
00:05:27,376 --> 00:05:30,337
and phones and encoding and some other stuff.

104
00:05:32,058 --> 00:05:36,900
So there's a very valid question you can ask yourself is,

105
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,421
is this just too much trouble?

106
00:05:40,102 --> 00:05:42,402
From my point of view, it's perfectly understandable

107
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:45,264
if you choose only one Chinese language to localize,

108
00:05:45,384 --> 00:05:45,884
if at all.

109
00:05:46,714 --> 00:05:48,955
Also, I asked myself the very same question,

110
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,136
why is it worth talking about this

111
00:05:51,237 --> 00:05:52,958
and spending time preparing all the materials?

112
00:05:53,618 --> 00:05:55,880
Because it's hard for me to see

113
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,421
that some of my favorite games,

114
00:05:57,521 --> 00:05:59,162
especially some of the indie games,

115
00:05:59,722 --> 00:06:01,043
sort of struggle in this regard.

116
00:06:01,323 --> 00:06:03,465
Also, I often feel like Chinese-speaking regions

117
00:06:03,545 --> 00:06:07,107
are not that well understood by people when I travel abroad.

118
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:11,730
And it goes without saying that I was greatly inspired

119
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:15,372
by the Arabic crash course that Rami gave us in GDC 15.

120
00:06:17,883 --> 00:06:21,424
Now let's just dive into some of the actual examples in games.

121
00:06:21,944 --> 00:06:25,345
And for the first example, I want to pull up The Witness.

122
00:06:26,265 --> 00:06:29,105
So actually for The Witness, I am

123
00:06:29,185 --> 00:06:34,087
going to talk about three different issues

124
00:06:34,147 --> 00:06:35,727
of different complexities in it.

125
00:06:36,287 --> 00:06:39,368
The first example here actually is very, very straightforward.

126
00:06:39,908 --> 00:06:43,309
You see five menu buttons in the traditional Chinese version

127
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:44,189
on a screenshot here.

128
00:06:46,145 --> 00:06:50,609
The first button in English is load a game.

129
00:06:51,530 --> 00:06:55,093
And then the traditional Chinese look like this one.

130
00:06:55,193 --> 00:06:58,376
So if we take that button text in the traditional Chinese

131
00:06:58,396 --> 00:07:00,978
version and translate it back into English for you to

132
00:07:00,998 --> 00:07:04,261
understand, it then becomes download a game.

133
00:07:05,435 --> 00:07:08,978
So if you play The Witness in traditional Chinese,

134
00:07:09,038 --> 00:07:11,460
this really sticks out like a sore thumb.

135
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,621
The game was seven years in the making

136
00:07:13,761 --> 00:07:16,243
and very deliberate and dedicated in all kinds of ways.

137
00:07:17,324 --> 00:07:19,586
Yet the translation people make this kind of mistakes

138
00:07:19,686 --> 00:07:21,947
and the original developer have no way to double check that.

139
00:07:24,229 --> 00:07:26,410
It just feel like the movie Titanic's night sky

140
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,312
if you get the Neil Dickerson, Tyson and Jim Cameron joke.

141
00:07:30,413 --> 00:07:31,294
Does anyone know that joke?

142
00:07:33,075 --> 00:07:33,315
Okay.

143
00:07:36,186 --> 00:07:37,626
Yeah, the star is wrong in the sky.

144
00:07:39,647 --> 00:07:43,528
So another example I want to highlight in the game

145
00:07:43,588 --> 00:07:44,108
is this one.

146
00:07:44,608 --> 00:07:47,729
It's rather complicated and reflects a few issues.

147
00:07:47,929 --> 00:07:53,431
And also, it's about one of the game's endings, so spoiler

148
00:07:53,471 --> 00:07:53,691
alert.

149
00:07:55,252 --> 00:08:00,515
In the main ending of The Witness, you step into this elevator thing and you launch it.

150
00:08:00,996 --> 00:08:06,879
The game basically will play a sequence of scripted animation of this elevator flying you around the island.

151
00:08:07,700 --> 00:08:11,362
And the game will also read you a part of Diamond Sutra in English.

152
00:08:11,843 --> 00:08:18,707
And you can see there some traditional Chinese translated lines of the Diamond Sutra in English on screen there.

153
00:08:20,345 --> 00:08:24,688
And so the line on this particular screenshot is a star at dawn,

154
00:08:26,128 --> 00:08:27,309
then a bubble in a stream,

155
00:08:28,269 --> 00:08:29,990
a flash of lightning in a summer cloud,

156
00:08:31,451 --> 00:08:32,312
a flickering lamp,

157
00:08:33,632 --> 00:08:34,192
a phantom,

158
00:08:35,433 --> 00:08:35,973
and a dream.

159
00:08:37,014 --> 00:08:39,835
So at the game's ending, at least for the first time,

160
00:08:40,316 --> 00:08:43,357
you sort of leave the game and you wake up from the dream, so to speak.

161
00:08:46,008 --> 00:08:46,849
But it's not as simple.

162
00:08:47,049 --> 00:08:50,111
So actually the fourth paragraph of this Diamond Sutra

163
00:08:50,131 --> 00:08:51,552
has another sentence in the beginning,

164
00:08:51,592 --> 00:08:54,374
starting with, so you should view this fleeting world

165
00:08:54,854 --> 00:08:57,236
as a star that had done a bubble in a stream, and so on.

166
00:08:59,157 --> 00:09:02,219
And here I've extracted the corresponding

167
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,061
traditional Chinese counterparts from the screenshots,

168
00:09:04,121 --> 00:09:06,202
which actually is a secondhand translation

169
00:09:06,742 --> 00:09:08,043
directly from the English there.

170
00:09:08,944 --> 00:09:10,685
And there are a few things I can say about this.

171
00:09:11,145 --> 00:09:14,588
It's a little bit too literal and some mistranslation.

172
00:09:15,681 --> 00:09:17,783
But the most important thing here should be,

173
00:09:17,803 --> 00:09:21,106
this translation should remind the players

174
00:09:21,206 --> 00:09:22,627
of Diamond Sutra in Chinese.

175
00:09:23,468 --> 00:09:27,331
So let's look the Diamond Sutra as we know it in Chinese.

176
00:09:29,953 --> 00:09:30,814
It's like totally different.

177
00:09:31,910 --> 00:09:34,612
And I've got a color code thing here.

178
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,533
Even if you don't read Chinese at all,

179
00:09:37,454 --> 00:09:39,515
you can still sort of understand what corresponds to what.

180
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:41,876
So things to note here is,

181
00:09:42,236 --> 00:09:44,738
first, the in-game English version

182
00:09:44,798 --> 00:09:46,319
already ignored the first sentence.

183
00:09:47,599 --> 00:09:49,941
And that first sentence, which is grayed out,

184
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:52,542
actually sums up pretty nicely

185
00:09:52,602 --> 00:09:54,763
for the first and the last Chinese sentence here.

186
00:09:55,304 --> 00:09:57,185
So actually, the Chinese character

187
00:09:57,205 --> 00:09:59,146
that corresponds to the in-game English version,

188
00:09:59,686 --> 00:10:01,247
just those 10 characters in the middle.

189
00:10:03,132 --> 00:10:07,734
Secondly, you also notice that the order of the color-coded words and sentences is actually different.

190
00:10:08,235 --> 00:10:13,757
If you recall the screenshot that I just showed, each line of Diamond Sutra is timed to the animation sequence.

191
00:10:14,458 --> 00:10:18,900
So you cannot just put the original Diamond Sutra in English into the game.

192
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:27,804
As I've mentioned, a good localization here is supposed to be making you think of Diamond Sutra in Chinese.

193
00:10:28,304 --> 00:10:29,545
Because if you don't, then...

194
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,460
an important layer of the meaning of the game

195
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,661
would just be lost for people who play in Chinese.

196
00:10:35,181 --> 00:10:36,942
And you would be a little bit confused

197
00:10:37,002 --> 00:10:39,463
about why the ending is this mystical gibberish.

198
00:10:41,724 --> 00:10:42,904
If you can understand the fact that

199
00:10:43,104 --> 00:10:44,845
these lines are from Diamond Sutra,

200
00:10:45,566 --> 00:10:47,206
so then you can understand what it's about,

201
00:10:47,286 --> 00:10:50,628
it actually connects to a few important ideas

202
00:10:50,808 --> 00:10:52,408
in the witness.

203
00:10:53,269 --> 00:10:54,969
So when I reached the ending for the first time,

204
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:56,190
I didn't realize that.

205
00:10:56,610 --> 00:10:58,251
Only after I saw the discussion on Reddit,

206
00:10:59,367 --> 00:11:02,108
I had a much clearer idea about the endings

207
00:11:02,608 --> 00:11:04,189
and several other smaller clues in the game.

208
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:06,789
So at least to me, this feels pretty important.

209
00:11:07,530 --> 00:11:09,450
Otherwise, why would a developer randomly choose

210
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:11,511
those specific quotes for the ending sequence?

211
00:11:11,611 --> 00:11:14,132
But as we have established,

212
00:11:14,272 --> 00:11:15,472
either you have a translation

213
00:11:15,492 --> 00:11:18,173
that's not gonna make people think of Diamond Sutra

214
00:11:18,193 --> 00:11:19,773
in Chinese, or when translating,

215
00:11:19,813 --> 00:11:21,874
you'd use Diamond Sutra in Chinese originally,

216
00:11:24,055 --> 00:11:26,455
but the ending animation sequence would be out of sync.

217
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:32,714
If the translator could somehow know he or she was actually translating Diamond Sutra,

218
00:11:33,394 --> 00:11:36,577
at least there is a chance there is a workable solution could be found.

219
00:11:37,938 --> 00:11:38,558
Something like this.

220
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:46,104
So you see now, so I made this and you see now all the color coded words and the sentences are

221
00:11:46,145 --> 00:11:50,808
in line with each other and even for the line that's actually not present in the Chinese version,

222
00:11:51,789 --> 00:11:53,811
the sentence in white there, a flickering lamp,

223
00:11:54,091 --> 00:11:56,853
that is actually nowhere to be found in the Chinese version.

224
00:11:57,988 --> 00:12:00,349
I can still just add that line and not breaking the order

225
00:12:00,889 --> 00:12:02,510
So if you're a Chinese speaking person

226
00:12:02,630 --> 00:12:05,572
and you've heard of Diamond Sutra before

227
00:12:05,992 --> 00:12:07,072
and then you see this version

228
00:12:07,412 --> 00:12:08,613
it would just be a lot easier

229
00:12:08,853 --> 00:12:10,814
for you to think of the source of the quotes

230
00:12:11,915 --> 00:12:15,616
And it's also deliberately written in a poem-like format

231
00:12:15,917 --> 00:12:18,178
although I wouldn't claim the poem quality is good

232
00:12:18,278 --> 00:12:19,999
but I think that serves the purpose

233
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,101
So in The Witness we've discussed about

234
00:12:25,041 --> 00:12:25,841
three different issues

235
00:12:26,729 --> 00:12:28,470
First is a very trivial localization error,

236
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:29,630
download a game.

237
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:31,951
Sometimes things like this happen due to the translator

238
00:12:32,671 --> 00:12:34,131
doesn't know their domain well,

239
00:12:34,392 --> 00:12:36,872
or the developer provide insufficient context to work with.

240
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,853
Since a lot of times the translator

241
00:12:38,913 --> 00:12:40,994
only get a simple script text file,

242
00:12:41,674 --> 00:12:43,514
and there are no visual cues, no audio cues,

243
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,035
no explanations, and no references.

244
00:12:46,535 --> 00:12:48,116
But of course, I honestly don't know

245
00:12:48,356 --> 00:12:49,156
why people would get,

246
00:12:50,437 --> 00:12:52,137
they were confused load with download.

247
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,952
And a second-hand translation issue,

248
00:12:56,612 --> 00:12:58,333
which you definitely want to double-check

249
00:12:58,433 --> 00:13:01,134
if your content originates from other cultures

250
00:13:01,294 --> 00:13:02,055
or other countries.

251
00:13:02,695 --> 00:13:05,016
Most other quotes from the audio log in the witness

252
00:13:05,436 --> 00:13:07,677
actually already state their source in-game,

253
00:13:07,777 --> 00:13:11,658
so the translator would have the basic context of the quote,

254
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,799
but unfortunately, the Diamond Sutra ending

255
00:13:13,919 --> 00:13:15,600
doesn't have the source stated.

256
00:13:17,020 --> 00:13:19,041
So supplying additional notes or references here

257
00:13:19,081 --> 00:13:21,222
definitely will be very helpful for localization process.

258
00:13:22,703 --> 00:13:27,205
Also, the important decisions you've already made during the development of your game,

259
00:13:27,305 --> 00:13:32,728
such as how to make the ending sequence based on translated materials like Diamond Sutra,

260
00:13:33,428 --> 00:13:37,050
this might come back to haunt you when you are going to localize the game in the end.

261
00:13:38,010 --> 00:13:40,711
I would have no idea what other languages can do about it

262
00:13:40,891 --> 00:13:45,353
if there isn't a version of Diamond Sutra in that particular language already.

263
00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,727
So in the last few slides, things like,

264
00:13:50,527 --> 00:13:52,468
the things that we talked about can actually happen

265
00:13:52,488 --> 00:13:54,608
to all kinds of localization process in any language.

266
00:13:55,468 --> 00:13:57,729
And now I'm going to be more focused

267
00:13:58,609 --> 00:14:00,069
on some of the detailed examples

268
00:14:00,129 --> 00:14:03,110
of a simplified and traditional Chinese differences.

269
00:14:04,110 --> 00:14:06,731
The first question you would ask is maybe

270
00:14:06,851 --> 00:14:09,571
why don't you just use a converter?

271
00:14:09,872 --> 00:14:12,752
I will show you examples why converter is just not viable.

272
00:14:14,608 --> 00:14:18,970
So we've just seen the term game in Chinese moments ago,

273
00:14:19,030 --> 00:14:20,090
so I will just use that again.

274
00:14:20,651 --> 00:14:22,432
Now let's break the two characters down.

275
00:14:22,772 --> 00:14:25,613
The both traditional and simplified Chinese versions,

276
00:14:26,373 --> 00:14:29,035
the vocabulary game has two Chinese characters.

277
00:14:29,355 --> 00:14:32,316
The idea of the second character is easier,

278
00:14:32,396 --> 00:14:33,897
which just means drama.

279
00:14:34,557 --> 00:14:36,538
And it actually is a one-to-one mapping.

280
00:14:37,923 --> 00:14:41,824
But for the first character, both play and swim characters

281
00:14:42,064 --> 00:14:43,445
are used in traditional Chinese,

282
00:14:43,685 --> 00:14:45,285
and they have different meanings.

283
00:14:45,485 --> 00:14:48,066
But in simplified, the two characters become one.

284
00:14:49,286 --> 00:14:51,767
And so the mapping is many to one in this case,

285
00:14:52,267 --> 00:14:53,768
which is not viable if you want to do

286
00:14:54,008 --> 00:14:56,168
simplified to traditional conversion.

287
00:14:56,188 --> 00:15:00,550
Okay, now this is a bit more complicated here.

288
00:15:01,230 --> 00:15:03,071
There are three Chinese characters here,

289
00:15:03,131 --> 00:15:05,891
and we use all three of them in traditional.

290
00:15:06,592 --> 00:15:11,315
They have the same pronunciation, the only difference being the last character's tone is different from the former two.

291
00:15:11,975 --> 00:15:14,257
So what is the big deal among these three characters?

292
00:15:14,897 --> 00:15:16,918
So now let's do that mapping again.

293
00:15:17,118 --> 00:15:25,243
First of all, this three-stroke character is used both in traditional Chinese and simplified Chinese, meaning interfere or involve.

294
00:15:26,084 --> 00:15:28,365
The next character, the first meaning is dry,

295
00:15:29,686 --> 00:15:35,469
but in simplified it is then mapped into this three-stroke character like the one above.

296
00:15:37,029 --> 00:15:39,170
And when this character forms compound terms

297
00:15:39,930 --> 00:15:41,471
combined with other Chinese characters,

298
00:15:43,392 --> 00:15:44,913
it forms terms like dried fish.

299
00:15:47,354 --> 00:15:50,076
But when it is combined with a relative term,

300
00:15:50,356 --> 00:15:52,517
such as sister, it means stepsister,

301
00:15:52,737 --> 00:15:55,739
and also stepmother, stepfather, and so on.

302
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,601
Finally, let's talk about this third character.

303
00:16:00,421 --> 00:16:02,563
It's pretty versatile in meanings already, as you can see.

304
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:07,971
But then the simplified Chinese version also simplified it

305
00:16:08,091 --> 00:16:11,573
into the very same character like the ones above.

306
00:16:12,333 --> 00:16:15,915
And not only that, now you can see it's really hard

307
00:16:16,395 --> 00:16:20,077
not to consider the F word potential and implication here

308
00:16:20,417 --> 00:16:23,398
when you see the very same character can also be used

309
00:16:23,438 --> 00:16:24,959
to describe step relatives.

310
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:29,621
Yeah, so you see some of these funny internet pictures

311
00:16:29,701 --> 00:16:32,582
about machine translated signs in simplified Chinese

312
00:16:32,642 --> 00:16:33,223
that look like this.

313
00:16:34,137 --> 00:16:35,937
And it probably means dried vegetable, right?

314
00:16:36,797 --> 00:16:38,698
This particular F word confusion won't happen

315
00:16:38,758 --> 00:16:40,978
to machine translated traditional Chinese,

316
00:16:41,058 --> 00:16:41,739
but you know,

317
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,839
teeth kicking old woman is just as bad.

318
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,540
So just to recap some of the points

319
00:16:48,780 --> 00:16:52,121
we've talked about simplified vs traditional.

320
00:16:52,601 --> 00:16:54,162
It goes without saying that the writing

321
00:16:54,202 --> 00:16:56,022
of a lot of characters in the simplified Chinese

322
00:16:56,102 --> 00:16:56,942
is a lot simpler,

323
00:16:57,723 --> 00:16:59,463
but also the meanings of the characters

324
00:16:59,543 --> 00:17:00,583
are changed or funneled.

325
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:05,527
And it is not a one-to-one or many-to-one mapping.

326
00:17:05,687 --> 00:17:07,627
It's rather a many-to-many mapping,

327
00:17:07,707 --> 00:17:10,168
considering a lot of the daily vocabularies

328
00:17:10,268 --> 00:17:12,208
are different in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan,

329
00:17:12,268 --> 00:17:15,008
making the conversion not really viable both ways.

330
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:18,009
You may also say that, okay,

331
00:17:18,109 --> 00:17:20,490
I'm making a game without words and text,

332
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:23,630
so localization should not be a problem for me, right?

333
00:17:24,530 --> 00:17:25,230
But that's not true,

334
00:17:25,390 --> 00:17:27,911
unless your game doesn't even use text for the game title,

335
00:17:29,511 --> 00:17:30,652
which is almost impossible.

336
00:17:31,558 --> 00:17:39,022
And beware of this issue because it might affect discoverability and also people's perception of the game in the target regions.

337
00:17:40,102 --> 00:17:48,127
So the first example is Jumblow's another famous title, Braid, which as far as I remember doesn't have any other official names other than the English one.

338
00:17:48,647 --> 00:17:51,588
When it came out in Taiwan, we just called it as is.

339
00:17:51,869 --> 00:17:59,873
But in China, I think some press or prominent players online started to call this four-character term.

340
00:18:01,015 --> 00:18:04,318
That basically translates back to time and space fantasy

341
00:18:05,619 --> 00:18:06,380
or something similar.

342
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:09,823
But anyway, it's an unofficial name that just caught on in China.

343
00:18:10,723 --> 00:18:13,165
However, in Taiwan, if you convert that four-character name

344
00:18:14,066 --> 00:18:15,087
into traditional Chinese,

345
00:18:15,827 --> 00:18:18,550
that actually is the name for Tales of Phantasia

346
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:20,551
and the later Tales of series.

347
00:18:21,152 --> 00:18:24,695
So if you dump that four-character into Google

348
00:18:25,355 --> 00:18:25,996
and search that,

349
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:28,578
there will be two different famous games coming up,

350
00:18:28,718 --> 00:18:30,159
which is rather confusing at times.

351
00:18:32,191 --> 00:18:33,973
Now the second example, Pokemon.

352
00:18:34,693 --> 00:18:36,615
This is going to be particularly interesting one,

353
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:39,858
and maybe start to get a little bit political.

354
00:18:40,539 --> 00:18:44,923
So in early 2016, Pokemon company tried to unify the name

355
00:18:45,003 --> 00:18:48,446
and the logo in the major Chinese speaking markets,

356
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,728
namely China, Taiwan, and Hong Kong.

357
00:18:51,469 --> 00:18:54,672
And for their upcoming, their then upcoming game,

358
00:18:54,852 --> 00:18:57,474
Pokemon Sun and Moon, which released last year.

359
00:18:59,593 --> 00:19:04,935
Because this was also the first time they were going to do an official Chinese version of the Pokemon games,

360
00:19:05,055 --> 00:19:09,397
so they thought they want to fix the name of the game in different regions once and for all.

361
00:19:10,537 --> 00:19:15,599
So here's the problem. Taiwan and Hong Kong have totally different names for Pokemon in the past,

362
00:19:15,699 --> 00:19:22,222
because back then in the mid 90s, Pokemon anime was introduced into both regions independently,

363
00:19:22,242 --> 00:19:29,145
although roughly around the same time. And the local people have different localizations.

364
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:32,437
And it's not even about a game, it's just an animation.

365
00:19:33,477 --> 00:19:36,839
And all the different Pokemons in the series,

366
00:19:37,299 --> 00:19:40,640
they mostly have different names between Taiwan and Hong Kong.

367
00:19:41,661 --> 00:19:45,742
And then the Pokemon company want to unify that last year.

368
00:19:47,326 --> 00:19:50,490
So here you don't have to understand what all the Chinese characters mean.

369
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,434
Suffice to say, now in Chinese speaking worlds,

370
00:19:53,754 --> 00:19:57,119
these three Chinese characters, Baokumon,

371
00:19:58,160 --> 00:19:59,942
in the bottom, maps to Pokemon now.

372
00:20:00,843 --> 00:20:03,287
And it's based on Mandarin pronunciation.

373
00:20:03,487 --> 00:20:04,568
This is an important point.

374
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:10,952
So about this specific issue, China market didn't have much influence over it over time in the past because

375
00:20:11,612 --> 00:20:18,596
it began with the localization of the anime and China lagged behind Taiwan and Hong Kong in this regard a bit back then

376
00:20:19,277 --> 00:20:27,182
and when their market was eventually exposed to franchise in a big way, China more or less settled down with the naming from Taiwan

377
00:20:28,482 --> 00:20:34,026
The reason is pretty obvious now because Hong Kong have been using Cantonese pronunciation to name the Pokemon

378
00:20:34,730 --> 00:20:37,912
And Taiwan and China both mainly use Mandarin.

379
00:20:40,413 --> 00:20:43,615
So the key here is, while people in Hong Kong and Taiwan

380
00:20:43,675 --> 00:20:46,157
both use traditional Chinese as the writing system,

381
00:20:46,197 --> 00:20:48,078
you can still end up with potentially,

382
00:20:48,418 --> 00:20:55,122
you can end up still facing hugely different localizations

383
00:20:55,442 --> 00:20:58,684
when trying to do the games localization.

384
00:20:59,284 --> 00:21:01,786
And the Pokemon company's decision didn't fare well,

385
00:21:02,146 --> 00:21:03,887
didn't fare too well for them in Hong Kong.

386
00:21:04,761 --> 00:21:06,342
Some gamers are really baffled by it.

387
00:21:07,623 --> 00:21:14,069
While it was supposed to be an unification on naming and lots of stuff in Pokemon,

388
00:21:14,389 --> 00:21:18,412
Hong Kong players were facing the fact that more than half of their beloved Pokemon names,

389
00:21:18,532 --> 00:21:22,816
which had been used for around 20 years, now being changed as a consequence.

390
00:21:23,396 --> 00:21:25,578
China and Taiwan players were hardly affected by it.

391
00:21:27,390 --> 00:21:31,953
So this was an actual photo for a real demonstration against Pokemon's new Chinese version in Hong Kong.

392
00:21:32,353 --> 00:21:35,355
The slogan on the sign here basically is saying,

393
00:21:35,475 --> 00:21:36,856
Give our Pokemon names back.

394
00:21:36,876 --> 00:21:39,937
These are the kind of things you just cannot be too careful about.

395
00:21:40,118 --> 00:21:44,980
You know, Japanese has always been very famous for their carefulness when doing business.

396
00:21:45,561 --> 00:21:51,384
But this kind of thing still happens, and I doubt they knew this would invoke protests like this.

397
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:57,321
As an opposite example, some of you might be familiar with,

398
00:21:58,301 --> 00:22:01,783
or at least heard of the mobile suit Gundam.

399
00:22:02,423 --> 00:22:05,565
And you'll see Bandai has basically no problem with it.

400
00:22:05,765 --> 00:22:09,506
Different regions have their own official translations.

401
00:22:12,908 --> 00:22:14,849
So next example, I was on a team

402
00:22:14,869 --> 00:22:16,950
that helped the official traditional Chinese

403
00:22:18,490 --> 00:22:20,271
subtitle for Indie Game Movie.

404
00:22:20,451 --> 00:22:23,953
And I mentioned that Netflix recently ruined it.

405
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:30,476
So the thing is, when we decided whether to translate the names or not,

406
00:22:31,236 --> 00:22:36,358
the main factor for us was, is the translation used by the developer or publisher themselves?

407
00:22:36,998 --> 00:22:45,720
If not, is there any local translation that could be verified by big and credible gaming press locally,

408
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:51,921
and even to a point that usage is customary or even historical, like a legacy name?

409
00:22:52,683 --> 00:22:58,145
If not, we just use the origin name in English or whatever it's from.

410
00:23:01,566 --> 00:23:05,308
But when Indie Game Movie was published on Netflix late 2016,

411
00:23:05,608 --> 00:23:12,310
Netflix changed almost all the names in our subtitle to use the names they found on Chinese Wikipedia,

412
00:23:12,351 --> 00:23:14,912
which is almost at all times not official names.

413
00:23:17,032 --> 00:23:21,334
Disrespectful or not, the main issue here is going to be discoverability on a storefront.

414
00:23:22,795 --> 00:23:25,036
Because if people watching Indie Game Movie in Chinese

415
00:23:25,076 --> 00:23:26,776
and saw name of the game,

416
00:23:27,356 --> 00:23:30,918
and couldn't find it on any platforms that it's on,

417
00:23:31,358 --> 00:23:32,218
are you doing any good,

418
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:33,798
or maybe you're actually hindering

419
00:23:33,818 --> 00:23:36,579
the discoverability of the game.

420
00:23:37,320 --> 00:23:38,060
And there's more to it.

421
00:23:39,580 --> 00:23:42,201
So let's see how bad the Wikipedia translated names can be,

422
00:23:42,461 --> 00:23:44,142
using Super Meat Boy as the example.

423
00:23:46,603 --> 00:23:48,503
So let's see what's going on with this

424
00:23:50,004 --> 00:23:51,244
Super Meat Boy's Chinese name.

425
00:23:53,232 --> 00:23:54,952
The first two characters are simple,

426
00:23:54,972 --> 00:23:57,093
the last two characters are simple, Super and Boy.

427
00:23:57,754 --> 00:24:02,316
But the middle two characters, that means Carnivorous.

428
00:24:03,256 --> 00:24:05,117
If you watched Indiana movie

429
00:24:05,577 --> 00:24:08,659
or seen Edmund talk about this character before,

430
00:24:08,719 --> 00:24:10,600
you know that it's about a concept

431
00:24:10,840 --> 00:24:12,521
of without skin and protection.

432
00:24:13,401 --> 00:24:14,982
And saying Meat Boy is carnivorous

433
00:24:15,102 --> 00:24:16,583
is almost the opposite of the point.

434
00:24:18,716 --> 00:24:22,777
And in fact, when the game was published by Microsoft Studios

435
00:24:23,057 --> 00:24:24,838
onto XBLA for the first time,

436
00:24:25,878 --> 00:24:27,039
they actually did a good job

437
00:24:27,639 --> 00:24:29,019
on traditional Chinese localization

438
00:24:29,079 --> 00:24:30,680
and give Midboy a cute Chinese name.

439
00:24:31,020 --> 00:24:33,061
To use the same character twice here

440
00:24:33,121 --> 00:24:35,541
is usually a way to emphasize the cuteness,

441
00:24:35,681 --> 00:24:37,602
or in this case, it can also mean chubby as well,

442
00:24:38,482 --> 00:24:41,783
without sabotaging the actual title of the game.

443
00:24:43,401 --> 00:24:49,186
So the points here are, if you don't decide on a localized name yourself, you are leaving this kind of opportunity to others.

444
00:24:49,626 --> 00:24:52,248
You should work with your translators on this issue if possible.

445
00:24:53,309 --> 00:24:59,995
Because, as I said, it hinders discoverability on the storefront and also the perception of the game in that particular region.

446
00:25:00,675 --> 00:25:04,539
And unofficial translations on Wikipedia is actually a real issue here.

447
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:09,202
I have no concrete idea how to solve this because you actually have...

448
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:13,983
no way to control Wikipedia editing.

449
00:25:19,947 --> 00:25:23,470
And the next example I'm going to bring up is Thumper.

450
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:29,414
So back in mid-2016, Mark from Drool

451
00:25:30,475 --> 00:25:32,696
asked me about the possible Chinese name for Thumper.

452
00:25:33,157 --> 00:25:34,417
He already knew something's up

453
00:25:34,497 --> 00:25:36,299
with the Chinese-speaking region

454
00:25:36,339 --> 00:25:39,361
since his lovely wife is actually from Hong Kong.

455
00:25:41,633 --> 00:25:43,834
Now let's do a small challenge in your mind

456
00:25:43,874 --> 00:25:44,734
just for a few seconds.

457
00:25:44,794 --> 00:25:46,995
If you know a second language other than English,

458
00:25:48,375 --> 00:25:50,816
how and what would you name Thumper in that language?

459
00:25:51,276 --> 00:25:54,017
Do you translate it by pronunciation or by meaning?

460
00:25:54,937 --> 00:25:56,777
Or a bit of both, or neither?

461
00:25:57,798 --> 00:25:58,978
What is your reasoning behind that?

462
00:25:59,858 --> 00:26:01,199
I hope you can agree with me

463
00:26:01,259 --> 00:26:02,579
that this is actually pretty hard.

464
00:26:03,813 --> 00:26:06,834
I don't know if it's possible for developers to do this,

465
00:26:06,914 --> 00:26:09,094
but there will be names that are hard to translate

466
00:26:09,175 --> 00:26:11,095
and there are names easy to translate.

467
00:26:11,415 --> 00:26:13,275
Let's just hope that you can land on something

468
00:26:13,295 --> 00:26:14,416
that's easier to translate

469
00:26:14,756 --> 00:26:16,656
and still being cool and unique in a way.

470
00:26:18,056 --> 00:26:21,617
So an opposite example to Thumper situation is this.

471
00:26:21,857 --> 00:26:23,417
Let's take a look at the manifold garden.

472
00:26:24,678 --> 00:26:27,478
So sort of at the same time, mid-2016,

473
00:26:28,398 --> 00:26:31,399
during early July, I invited the developer, William,

474
00:26:31,579 --> 00:26:32,119
back to...

475
00:26:33,157 --> 00:26:36,438
Taiwan and give a talk at our conference, which is

476
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:41,140
Type A Game Developers Forum 2016, and he just casually mentioned this to me

477
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:46,142
Saying that his friend suggested to him that he go with the name

478
00:26:46,162 --> 00:26:52,764
This four character name which means infinite garden in Chinese as you can see it's very close to manifold garden

479
00:26:53,503 --> 00:26:58,585
So this serves as an example of easy to translate names.

480
00:26:59,045 --> 00:27:03,027
And infinite garden in Chinese still sounds pretty cool and true to the theme as well.

481
00:27:04,027 --> 00:27:07,209
So William said he probably will go with this name in Chinese.

482
00:27:08,689 --> 00:27:13,071
Of course, sometimes there are very good reasons to leave some specific things in your game

483
00:27:13,771 --> 00:27:15,552
untranslated on purpose.

484
00:27:16,132 --> 00:27:20,474
And I don't mean just the title but also other specific terms you created for your game.

485
00:27:21,192 --> 00:27:24,636
because gameplay or design or aesthetic reasons

486
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:29,522
or maybe your translators just couldn't find a good corresponding term in the target language

487
00:27:30,783 --> 00:27:35,729
However, when it comes to China, let me briefly talk about China's new policy here since late 2016

488
00:27:38,249 --> 00:27:45,536
Basically, they have a mobile game content regulation citing other language-related regulations in China.

489
00:27:46,116 --> 00:27:50,701
And as far as I know, somehow it is not only enforced on mobile games,

490
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:55,265
but also on console platforms that have branches in China.

491
00:27:56,266 --> 00:28:01,651
It's either that, or there are similar regulations or laws for console and PC games that I didn't dug up.

492
00:28:03,160 --> 00:28:09,164
Like there are several other related laws regarding general publication, online publication, online games

493
00:28:10,985 --> 00:28:14,128
which more or less have the same context in China.

494
00:28:16,409 --> 00:28:19,592
So these are the actual title of the regulation if you want to check them out.

495
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:23,354
Of course there are no English versions for these documents.

496
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:28,738
I only write them down, I write those notes down so that English speakers can understand.

497
00:28:31,063 --> 00:28:34,545
If there are friends here who know more about the specifics

498
00:28:35,125 --> 00:28:36,666
of the approval process in China,

499
00:28:36,706 --> 00:28:37,807
please correct me if I'm wrong.

500
00:28:38,367 --> 00:28:40,328
As far as I understand, the reason why Thumper

501
00:28:40,368 --> 00:28:45,591
needed a Chinese name is exactly because of those regulations.

502
00:28:46,852 --> 00:28:49,213
When he asked me about it back then,

503
00:28:49,554 --> 00:28:51,054
he was trying to get the deal sealed

504
00:28:51,134 --> 00:28:52,815
with the approval process in China.

505
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:57,538
But in fact, Sony had already sent names to the process

506
00:28:57,578 --> 00:28:59,019
without Mark realizing.

507
00:29:00,118 --> 00:29:02,160
three of them were pre-approved.

508
00:29:02,440 --> 00:29:05,342
So basically, the developer had to choose

509
00:29:05,723 --> 00:29:08,164
one out of those pre-approved names.

510
00:29:10,426 --> 00:29:12,868
There was no other options due to time constraints,

511
00:29:13,369 --> 00:29:15,811
since it's extremely costly to resubmit.

512
00:29:16,771 --> 00:29:18,633
The official statement is that the process

513
00:29:18,713 --> 00:29:22,116
usually costs one month, but what I've been hearing

514
00:29:22,156 --> 00:29:26,219
is that it's between three to six months in the worst case.

515
00:29:29,058 --> 00:29:33,645
So in China, Thumper is translated to rampaging beetle.

516
00:29:34,226 --> 00:29:37,471
This is sort of an okay name considering the circumstances

517
00:29:37,672 --> 00:29:40,937
and the other two pre-approved names were even worse.

518
00:29:43,900 --> 00:29:47,882
So another example I want to talk about is Deemo.

519
00:29:48,002 --> 00:29:51,424
So this game is from a pretty successful game studio

520
00:29:51,684 --> 00:29:52,924
in Taiwan called Rayark,

521
00:29:53,565 --> 00:29:55,245
which is best known for their rhythm games.

522
00:29:55,706 --> 00:29:58,427
Deemo was released on PS Vita some time ago,

523
00:29:58,567 --> 00:29:59,447
and during last year,

524
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:01,808
they were also trying to get approved in China.

525
00:30:03,546 --> 00:30:05,846
In order to get approved, they translated the game title,

526
00:30:06,027 --> 00:30:09,047
and also they have to show it next to the original title.

527
00:30:09,607 --> 00:30:13,948
Other indie games on PSN China had to do this as well,

528
00:30:14,008 --> 00:30:14,689
including Thumper.

529
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,549
But for Deemo, there are other stuff,

530
00:30:18,569 --> 00:30:19,730
further complicated things.

531
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:22,650
So you see, this is the result menu

532
00:30:22,730 --> 00:30:24,431
after you finish a song in a game,

533
00:30:24,871 --> 00:30:26,131
and it originally looked like this.

534
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:30,632
And the simplified Chinese version got changed to this.

535
00:30:31,433 --> 00:30:33,975
One interesting thing is that they didn't translate the...

536
00:30:34,996 --> 00:30:38,838
There is a yellow text there, Hard Level 8, which is the difficulty of the song

537
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:44,102
They didn't translate, instead they just changed it to the corresponding text, to L8

538
00:30:45,723 --> 00:30:52,028
And because Hard Level 8 in simplified Chinese is just so much more cluttered visually

539
00:30:52,768 --> 00:30:54,209
than the original Hard LV8 text

540
00:30:56,790 --> 00:31:02,374
And the approval feedback said if the English text or letters don't have obvious meanings,

541
00:31:03,095 --> 00:31:06,037
you can leave them as is, but you have to translate everything else.

542
00:31:06,757 --> 00:31:12,822
So LV in this context obviously means level, so they said it had to be translated.

543
00:31:14,483 --> 00:31:18,887
Then the approval feedback also demanded them to translate all song names.

544
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:20,368
But

545
00:31:20,949 --> 00:31:27,272
Then again, it didn't look as good, and the song names' textures were custom made by artists originally.

546
00:31:27,692 --> 00:31:30,994
It would be quite impossible to redesign them all in simplified Chinese,

547
00:31:31,435 --> 00:31:35,917
not to mention that some of the song names don't sound as good after translation.

548
00:31:36,577 --> 00:31:40,700
So their compromise was they would show the suggested translation

549
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:43,581
for the song names on top right corner of the screen.

550
00:31:45,160 --> 00:31:50,509
At one point, they were even asked to translate the composer names that will be shown in another menu.

551
00:31:50,609 --> 00:31:51,731
But the composer names...

552
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:54,976
A lot of composer names actually are invented words.

553
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:56,498
That is not...

554
00:31:58,437 --> 00:32:04,523
even translatable. And even if they are translatable, a lot of times composer names serve as a unique

555
00:32:04,624 --> 00:32:09,769
trademark for them and should be universally used. It would be a huge problem for rhythm games if

556
00:32:09,829 --> 00:32:15,314
the translation is enforced. Fortunately, the approval people in China finally understood that

557
00:32:15,575 --> 00:32:18,097
and dropped the topic for the composer names.

558
00:32:21,328 --> 00:32:22,189
A few things here.

559
00:32:22,789 --> 00:32:27,232
First, I think negotiations during the approval process

560
00:32:27,292 --> 00:32:29,714
is almost unavoidable.

561
00:32:30,795 --> 00:32:33,617
And also, the approval feedback

562
00:32:34,097 --> 00:32:35,618
could still be reasonable in the end,

563
00:32:35,879 --> 00:32:39,661
but you need to be prepared for several

564
00:32:39,701 --> 00:32:42,083
back and forth discussions that take up a lot of time.

565
00:32:42,363 --> 00:32:45,005
And you need to put effort into modifying stuff

566
00:32:45,466 --> 00:32:48,288
other than the usual things you already have to do

567
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:50,029
when doing general localization.

568
00:32:51,112 --> 00:32:56,075
Since every game is different, though there are guidelines you can check out,

569
00:32:57,396 --> 00:33:02,559
it is still hard to tell if your specific case will be approved or not in advance.

570
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:07,282
And I'm not even talking about other parts of the regulations.

571
00:33:08,243 --> 00:33:13,126
They are just so much more detailed but up to interpretation, not exhaustive stuff.

572
00:33:18,820 --> 00:33:21,160
So all that is already out of scope of this talk,

573
00:33:21,180 --> 00:33:21,921
so I'll just stop there.

574
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:24,861
In short, suffice to say,

575
00:33:24,901 --> 00:33:27,082
if you want to release on mobile or console in China,

576
00:33:27,262 --> 00:33:28,402
find a good publisher.

577
00:33:29,482 --> 00:33:31,503
And in the case of Thumper and Deemo

578
00:33:31,963 --> 00:33:32,903
that I just talked about,

579
00:33:32,963 --> 00:33:34,384
basically it's Sony helping them

580
00:33:34,504 --> 00:33:36,764
dealing with all this approval and feedback process.

581
00:33:42,026 --> 00:33:44,366
Okay, so go back to easier stuff, encoding.

582
00:33:45,306 --> 00:33:47,967
Now, nowadays this should not be a problem anymore.

583
00:33:49,246 --> 00:33:52,067
because you should be able to just stick to UTF-8 at all times.

584
00:33:52,928 --> 00:33:57,410
But just watch out for this byte order mark thing that only Windows has.

585
00:33:58,090 --> 00:34:01,632
When I was helping Indy get a movie during the subtitle,

586
00:34:02,953 --> 00:34:04,814
at some point during their text processing,

587
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:09,776
the encoding was somehow changed into UCS2 slash UTF-16.

588
00:34:10,457 --> 00:34:12,878
And we didn't realize that and made a mess for a little while.

589
00:34:14,224 --> 00:34:21,008
Another big issue turned out to be that when UTF-16 and the UCS2 texts were being integrated

590
00:34:21,049 --> 00:34:28,293
into the Indie Gamer Movie Player on Steam, there was a forced replacement of all carriage

591
00:34:28,353 --> 00:34:29,614
returns with line feeds.

592
00:34:30,715 --> 00:34:36,378
And because of the fact that UTF-16 characters are multibyte fixed length encoding.

593
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:44,746
The 0Ds and 0As which were carriage returns and line feeds in ASCII

594
00:34:45,246 --> 00:34:48,628
were also used by multibyte Chinese characters in UTF-16.

595
00:34:49,509 --> 00:34:53,772
So the force replacement ruined a very small portion of the subtitle,

596
00:34:54,092 --> 00:34:55,253
like what's being shown here.

597
00:34:56,694 --> 00:35:00,436
And we didn't even notice that before it got released on Steam.

598
00:35:01,517 --> 00:35:03,518
So we have to fix that afterwards very quickly.

599
00:35:05,588 --> 00:35:13,512
So I think the takeaway is that always check every related options in all the editors you might touch during the development process.

600
00:35:14,333 --> 00:35:19,976
Unless, I mean usually it's not just you, it's all the people on the team.

601
00:35:20,236 --> 00:35:28,340
Some people may do text most programmatically, and some people may use different editors because of specific reasons.

602
00:35:28,540 --> 00:35:33,322
And bad stuff can happen and hide within all the sorts of places you might not think of.

603
00:35:33,954 --> 00:35:35,894
So basically UTF-8 all the way.

604
00:35:37,755 --> 00:35:40,375
Now this is a big deal here, UI and phone issues.

605
00:35:42,076 --> 00:35:46,636
Here's the menu of Skull of the Shogun in simplified Chinese version on Google Play.

606
00:35:47,377 --> 00:35:51,937
Of course the game itself was great, but at first glance at this screenshot,

607
00:35:52,277 --> 00:35:58,839
even if you don't read Chinese, you should still notice there are Sirif and Sense Sirif phones mixed up with each other.

608
00:35:59,399 --> 00:36:01,479
Under no circumstances should you do that.

609
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:04,905
And it's just strange why this was published as is.

610
00:36:06,345 --> 00:36:08,245
Of course, the original developer, 17bit,

611
00:36:08,345 --> 00:36:09,766
was not responsible for this.

612
00:36:10,506 --> 00:36:13,006
I think another studio ported the Android version for them.

613
00:36:13,086 --> 00:36:14,466
But again, the point here is just

614
00:36:14,506 --> 00:36:15,807
that even if you don't read Chinese,

615
00:36:16,147 --> 00:36:17,787
you should still be able to see the problem.

616
00:36:19,347 --> 00:36:21,348
The second problem is also pretty common

617
00:36:21,368 --> 00:36:22,708
when you try to localize into Chinese.

618
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:26,029
You see the button text is already

619
00:36:26,089 --> 00:36:28,629
quite small on the top left.

620
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:30,770
But let me just show you the Chinese version.

621
00:36:33,662 --> 00:36:37,944
So, the buttons on top left corner are totally unreadable.

622
00:36:38,384 --> 00:36:39,065
So two things here.

623
00:36:39,445 --> 00:36:42,606
Chinese characters just have a higher stroke density.

624
00:36:43,607 --> 00:36:44,167
It's a fact.

625
00:36:44,567 --> 00:36:46,028
So when you use small fonts,

626
00:36:46,328 --> 00:36:47,789
English versions may still be readable,

627
00:36:47,829 --> 00:36:49,309
but there's going to be some chance

628
00:36:49,329 --> 00:36:51,770
that the Chinese version will be unreadable,

629
00:36:51,830 --> 00:36:52,331
just like this.

630
00:36:53,391 --> 00:36:56,432
Moreover, maybe because of the scale of the font settings

631
00:36:57,313 --> 00:36:58,473
or just different...

632
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:04,843
the phone settings just different between different phone files.

633
00:37:05,684 --> 00:37:08,945
When you want to draw it using the API calls,

634
00:37:11,746 --> 00:37:17,827
say I want the texture to be generated from this 24 point glyph,

635
00:37:18,448 --> 00:37:22,829
the end result might not be the same using different phones.

636
00:37:23,189 --> 00:37:27,830
So like in one phone the 24 point character is like bigger than the other one.

637
00:37:30,632 --> 00:37:33,354
And another example here is from the game Fez.

638
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:36,557
This is from the English PC version.

639
00:37:36,637 --> 00:37:38,598
You see all the pixel art characters

640
00:37:38,659 --> 00:37:39,639
are very cool and sleek.

641
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:43,022
But now the traditional Chinese PC version,

642
00:37:43,062 --> 00:37:46,244
just by changing it into a pretty standard

643
00:37:46,284 --> 00:37:49,427
sensory phone there, you start to feel

644
00:37:49,447 --> 00:37:51,428
that there's a conflict in style

645
00:37:51,488 --> 00:37:53,630
with the escape button down there already.

646
00:37:55,311 --> 00:37:59,055
And now let's see the original Xbox 360 version of Fez,

647
00:37:59,255 --> 00:38:00,676
which was an earlier release.

648
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,658
They used a different Chinese phone back then.

649
00:38:03,279 --> 00:38:05,481
And this particular phone was sort of an equivalence

650
00:38:05,601 --> 00:38:09,044
of Comic Sans in Chinese, which although was kind of cute,

651
00:38:10,105 --> 00:38:11,226
I just don't think they are a good fit

652
00:38:11,246 --> 00:38:12,528
for Fez in my opinion.

653
00:38:14,229 --> 00:38:16,051
It's also worth noting that the different phones

654
00:38:16,111 --> 00:38:18,453
were chosen for different platform releases.

655
00:38:19,918 --> 00:38:22,938
Of course there could be multiple reasons why they did this,

656
00:38:23,539 --> 00:38:26,459
such as the phone license was exclusive for 360 version.

657
00:38:27,399 --> 00:38:29,800
We don't know, but this is also a real problem

658
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,880
we are trying to localizing for multiple platforms

659
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:33,180
because you might need different,

660
00:38:34,281 --> 00:38:36,741
under certain circumstances you might need

661
00:38:36,921 --> 00:38:38,821
different phones on different platforms.

662
00:38:40,542 --> 00:38:43,862
And also, you see this spacing between the punctuation marks

663
00:38:44,002 --> 00:38:46,543
and other Chinese characters and also the line heights.

664
00:38:47,043 --> 00:38:49,103
Everything is just so cluttered.

665
00:38:49,989 --> 00:38:51,129
and making quite hard to read.

666
00:38:51,670 --> 00:38:55,011
This can also happen to a lot of localization process

667
00:38:55,331 --> 00:38:57,492
and it's quite technical because you need to understand

668
00:38:57,512 --> 00:39:01,713
the effect and the details of typography information

669
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,633
from a true type phone and such.

670
00:39:04,574 --> 00:39:06,054
And the different phones for different languages

671
00:39:06,434 --> 00:39:08,135
can just throw you off in all kinds of ways.

672
00:39:10,896 --> 00:39:12,336
So finally some general concerns

673
00:39:12,396 --> 00:39:13,997
about Chinese phone themselves.

674
00:39:14,237 --> 00:39:16,418
The biggest problem we face collectively

675
00:39:16,898 --> 00:39:18,838
is that the pricing is just so steep.

676
00:39:22,305 --> 00:39:24,806
I have an actual quote from a Taiwanese phone company.

677
00:39:25,567 --> 00:39:29,790
So if you want to embed a phone into your distribution

678
00:39:30,851 --> 00:39:38,856
for one phone, they were charging it for 10,000 US dollars

679
00:39:38,996 --> 00:39:40,517
per product, per platform.

680
00:39:41,418 --> 00:39:42,519
It's just crazy.

681
00:39:43,319 --> 00:39:44,600
And also there's a lack of choice.

682
00:39:45,701 --> 00:39:52,625
Most of the time, you are left only with two standard choice, which is a standard looking series font and a standard looking sans series font.

683
00:39:54,066 --> 00:39:56,388
Because Chinese fonts are just fucking hard to make.

684
00:39:57,088 --> 00:40:01,171
You know, like, ASCII, 128 characters, it's pretty easy, right?

685
00:40:02,251 --> 00:40:06,254
You can have thousands of font choices, and also, you know, you can have things like windings.

686
00:40:07,054 --> 00:40:10,696
But for a Chinese font to have general purpose usefulness...

687
00:40:12,643 --> 00:40:16,387
it has to, say, at least have 5,000 different characters.

688
00:40:17,048 --> 00:40:19,450
And the average design difficulty for each character

689
00:40:19,870 --> 00:40:21,412
is also way higher.

690
00:40:22,994 --> 00:40:24,695
And to keep a lower cost on this,

691
00:40:24,796 --> 00:40:26,357
especially for indie developers,

692
00:40:26,858 --> 00:40:29,380
usually you would have to rely on system phones,

693
00:40:29,861 --> 00:40:32,123
you know, calling from OS-specific APIs.

694
00:40:33,128 --> 00:40:37,571
And it can be very hard to unify the looks and the style across platform.

695
00:40:37,751 --> 00:40:43,295
Although I have to say the default Sans Serif font nowadays on different platforms

696
00:40:43,735 --> 00:40:46,778
actually look more and more like each other nowadays.

697
00:40:47,398 --> 00:40:51,001
So if you only need a style-neutral Sans Serif font,

698
00:40:51,061 --> 00:40:56,565
you may be able to get away with just using the always default fonts.

699
00:40:59,552 --> 00:41:04,075
But if for any reason you need a free and embeddable Chinese phone for your game, for Serif,

700
00:41:04,215 --> 00:41:08,777
you can try Hanazono Mincho, which is a Japanese academia produced phone,

701
00:41:08,917 --> 00:41:10,798
originally intended for Buddhism research.

702
00:41:11,919 --> 00:41:15,120
I think it also covers all Chinese, Japanese, and Korean characters.

703
00:41:15,781 --> 00:41:22,424
And for Senserif style, I think the best one currently is the Google NotoSense CJK series.

704
00:41:23,025 --> 00:41:25,286
CJK stands for Chinese, Japanese, and Korean.

705
00:41:26,562 --> 00:41:29,743
It was a brilliant collaboration between Google and Adobe.

706
00:41:32,264 --> 00:41:34,865
There's also an open source phone project

707
00:41:34,885 --> 00:41:36,426
called the Wunchan-E in China.

708
00:41:36,446 --> 00:41:39,308
And they started the project many, many years ago

709
00:41:39,348 --> 00:41:40,608
and it's also quite popular.

710
00:41:40,788 --> 00:41:42,889
But Wunchan-E is licensed under GPL,

711
00:41:42,989 --> 00:41:46,371
so there may be GPL implications.

712
00:41:48,132 --> 00:41:49,472
And just for the sake of being thorough,

713
00:41:50,073 --> 00:41:50,933
when it comes to phones,

714
00:41:50,973 --> 00:41:53,114
there are also phone glyph design differences.

715
00:41:54,651 --> 00:42:01,476
So the phone glyphs here on the left side are designed in Taiwan and the ones on the right side are designed in China.

716
00:42:01,936 --> 00:42:04,878
And this is not about simplified or traditional differences.

717
00:42:05,419 --> 00:42:13,244
Basically what I'm saying is, there are phones more suitable for Taiwan and some phones more suitable for China.

718
00:42:15,005 --> 00:42:17,667
But actually it probably won't affect your gaming in any way.

719
00:42:18,857 --> 00:42:22,358
If you really are interested in knowing more about this stuff, you can try looking into...

720
00:42:22,778 --> 00:42:26,219
There's a book called CJKV Information Processing.

721
00:42:26,319 --> 00:42:27,819
It's published by O'Reilly.

722
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,262
And the last category of issues, it's political and going to be pretty fun.

723
00:42:37,902 --> 00:42:41,223
Although we've already seen a bit of this from the Pokémon thing.

724
00:42:44,957 --> 00:42:48,879
Back in early 2016 in Taiwan, this is actually pretty huge.

725
00:42:49,599 --> 00:42:52,220
Street Fighter V came out back then,

726
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:57,103
and what can possibly be political about Street Fighter V?

727
00:42:58,303 --> 00:43:01,465
But as you recall, Street Fighter V has been developed

728
00:43:01,545 --> 00:43:03,906
and promoted as an eSport-focused video game,

729
00:43:04,166 --> 00:43:08,088
and they were doing all kinds of official push

730
00:43:08,148 --> 00:43:09,929
for Street Fighter V eSports

731
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:13,091
in a way that is never seen before in the series.

732
00:43:14,097 --> 00:43:17,298
Now locked in players can choose their own nationality

733
00:43:17,338 --> 00:43:19,898
to represent themselves or their country.

734
00:43:20,639 --> 00:43:23,160
And of course, national flag system was also designed.

735
00:43:26,641 --> 00:43:29,261
But when it comes to Taiwan.

736
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:36,282
If you ever watched the Olympics or some of the Baseball World Cup games before,

737
00:43:36,342 --> 00:43:38,983
you might recognize this flag as Chinese Taipei flag,

738
00:43:39,544 --> 00:43:44,366
which is a flag that Taiwan is forced to use in actual international sports events.

739
00:43:45,026 --> 00:43:47,787
But even then, there is something off about this flag.

740
00:43:49,768 --> 00:43:55,090
It's a mash-up by Capcom people using Chinese Taipei flag and their own trademark.

741
00:43:56,531 --> 00:43:58,731
I mean, what the flying F is this, Capcom?

742
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:03,669
A very famous Taiwanese Street Fighter player, Gamer B,

743
00:44:04,750 --> 00:44:06,731
and a lot of Taiwanese, other Taiwanese players

744
00:44:07,032 --> 00:44:10,074
try to send complaints about this,

745
00:44:10,174 --> 00:44:12,716
but Capcom just gave a sorry, not sorry answer.

746
00:44:14,798 --> 00:44:17,080
This is fairly new too, Winning Eleven 17,

747
00:44:17,300 --> 00:44:18,301
also came out last year.

748
00:44:18,321 --> 00:44:22,245
Or as you note here, Pro Evolution Soccer.

749
00:44:23,185 --> 00:44:27,847
Actually, they really put into some serious effort for Chinese-speaking regions.

750
00:44:27,947 --> 00:44:30,788
The game has complete Mandarin and Cantonese voiceover,

751
00:44:30,928 --> 00:44:35,369
which is actually pretty fun when you imagine anchormen shouting in Cantonese.

752
00:44:37,230 --> 00:44:38,111
But they also did this.

753
00:44:39,291 --> 00:44:41,272
If you choose Taiwan in the country options,

754
00:44:41,492 --> 00:44:44,953
it will warn you about not being able to attend any international games.

755
00:44:46,834 --> 00:44:51,856
You know, as a Taiwanese gamer, I can only say that this game's realism is impeccable.

756
00:44:54,256 --> 00:44:59,618
So, lastly, this example just came out a few months ago.

757
00:45:00,118 --> 00:45:05,459
Yakuza 6 has a Taiwanese hostess that you can meet up.

758
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,520
One particular dialogue is about her homeland,

759
00:45:08,760 --> 00:45:11,981
and this was the line when Yakuza 6 came out originally.

760
00:45:12,762 --> 00:45:15,702
What is your impression of the country of Taiwan?

761
00:45:16,443 --> 00:45:19,344
There is no English version of Yakuza 6 now,

762
00:45:19,424 --> 00:45:20,784
so that's just my translation.

763
00:45:21,819 --> 00:45:25,102
As a result, a lot of Taiwanese gamers were very proud of Sega at the time,

764
00:45:25,182 --> 00:45:29,626
but not long after the screenshot was posted online and began to circulate,

765
00:45:29,987 --> 00:45:34,931
some of the prominent internet personalities in China started to raise this issue,

766
00:45:35,512 --> 00:45:37,213
and basically Sega bailed out.

767
00:45:38,434 --> 00:45:42,718
So about a week later, the line became, you know, like this.

768
00:45:43,797 --> 00:45:46,859
And from a production point of view, let's just be neutral about it,

769
00:45:47,179 --> 00:45:50,081
from a production point of view, if you make mistakes like this,

770
00:45:50,521 --> 00:45:54,364
mistakes like this, this is not just text changes, you know,

771
00:45:54,604 --> 00:45:59,627
you have also to change the voiceover as well in just in a few days.

772
00:46:01,708 --> 00:46:06,892
However, fun fact, Yakuza 6 isn't even released in China yet.

773
00:46:07,892 --> 00:46:09,994
There is no simplified Chinese version as of now.

774
00:46:11,039 --> 00:46:18,145
And as a matter of fact, the whole Yakuza series has never been officially released in China, ever, in the past.

775
00:46:18,806 --> 00:46:21,228
Somehow Sega had to employ self-censorship over this.

776
00:46:21,588 --> 00:46:22,970
So I guess this is quite interesting.

777
00:46:24,871 --> 00:46:28,454
This is the kind of things you might run into when doing localization in Chinese.

778
00:46:29,976 --> 00:46:33,839
So now let me just quickly summarize a few tips and conclusions.

779
00:46:35,661 --> 00:46:38,985
So I've noticed this on a few occasions in the past.

780
00:46:39,165 --> 00:46:43,209
There is this one symptom you can easily recognize

781
00:46:43,269 --> 00:46:45,792
if your Chinese localization is machine translated.

782
00:46:46,613 --> 00:46:48,415
So what you see here is the option menu

783
00:46:48,455 --> 00:46:51,158
from Skull of the Shogun in the simplified Chinese version

784
00:46:51,178 --> 00:46:52,059
on Google Play.

785
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,543
The option being highlighted here

786
00:46:56,023 --> 00:46:57,525
is the language setting option.

787
00:47:00,031 --> 00:47:05,774
The last character in that three-character term is 人, meaning person

788
00:47:06,594 --> 00:47:09,215
And the language option should not be something person

789
00:47:11,776 --> 00:47:14,658
Another language choice, it's a four-character word

790
00:47:15,658 --> 00:47:18,819
If you see that particular character at the end of a Chinese word

791
00:47:19,039 --> 00:47:20,640
it either means off something

792
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:24,442
or it's an empty word following a verb or an adjective

793
00:47:25,702 --> 00:47:28,503
And still, the language option should not be like that

794
00:47:30,167 --> 00:47:33,329
So if your language choices have something similar to those,

795
00:47:33,749 --> 00:47:36,711
you know it's almost certainly machine translated.

796
00:47:36,731 --> 00:47:40,092
And by extension, other parts of your localization

797
00:47:40,213 --> 00:47:41,913
may be machine translated as well,

798
00:47:41,973 --> 00:47:43,154
so you better do something about it.

799
00:47:44,495 --> 00:47:47,516
And just for your information, if you don't know yet,

800
00:47:47,676 --> 00:47:50,318
the term simplified Chinese written in simplified Chinese

801
00:47:50,338 --> 00:47:53,199
look like that, and the traditional Chinese

802
00:47:53,239 --> 00:47:55,080
written in traditional Chinese look like that.

803
00:47:55,781 --> 00:47:58,642
So this is what your language options should look like.

804
00:48:00,857 --> 00:48:02,517
Also, I talked about the converter issues

805
00:48:02,557 --> 00:48:04,378
between simplified and traditional Chinese.

806
00:48:05,098 --> 00:48:08,659
You don't want your translator ever to be using converters.

807
00:48:09,240 --> 00:48:10,720
Although, if you don't know Chinese,

808
00:48:10,740 --> 00:48:12,741
you cannot check if they use the converters.

809
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:16,242
But actually, that's not true.

810
00:48:18,063 --> 00:48:19,523
What I'm going to propose here

811
00:48:19,543 --> 00:48:20,864
might sound a little bit stupid,

812
00:48:21,144 --> 00:48:25,405
but actually, you can find your own converter online.

813
00:48:25,465 --> 00:48:30,427
There are ones with English interfaces on the web.

814
00:48:31,215 --> 00:48:33,635
You can find the converter online and use that yourself,

815
00:48:33,775 --> 00:48:36,016
and try to compare a small portion of the text

816
00:48:36,176 --> 00:48:39,176
from traditional and simplified Chinese versions of your game.

817
00:48:39,937 --> 00:48:42,557
You know, better to test a few longer sentences.

818
00:48:43,537 --> 00:48:48,138
It should be pretty obvious if they are auto-converted,

819
00:48:48,218 --> 00:48:50,659
because they will look the same as your output

820
00:48:51,479 --> 00:48:52,859
from the converter you just used.

821
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,580
And you can then decide if something needs to be done about it,

822
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:59,561
like find another localization service or something.

823
00:49:02,420 --> 00:49:06,522
But if you just want to check if your traditional Chinese localization is converted from Simplify,

824
00:49:06,562 --> 00:49:08,502
there is a very simple way to tell that.

825
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:14,365
So if your traditional Chinese menu has this term, which is restaurant menu,

826
00:49:15,205 --> 00:49:19,167
then this is 100% guaranteed a direct conversion from Simplify Chinese,

827
00:49:19,807 --> 00:49:23,929
because the term is simply used like that in China.

828
00:49:23,989 --> 00:49:25,570
It's sort of a legacy term.

829
00:49:26,090 --> 00:49:28,391
But both Taiwan and Hong Kong don't use that.

830
00:49:29,191 --> 00:49:31,252
Of course, unless you are making a restaurant game.

831
00:49:33,149 --> 00:49:36,452
So next you have to know who you are working with.

832
00:49:37,714 --> 00:49:39,675
Be sure to ask your localization service translator

833
00:49:39,736 --> 00:49:41,978
or publishers to make sure whether they are doing

834
00:49:42,038 --> 00:49:44,480
simplified or traditional Chinese or both.

835
00:49:45,001 --> 00:49:48,024
Best case scenario, they should have different people

836
00:49:48,124 --> 00:49:50,386
dedicated to simplified and traditional separately.

837
00:49:51,627 --> 00:49:53,489
And please do not say just, you know,

838
00:49:53,609 --> 00:49:54,790
we have that in Chinese.

839
00:49:55,631 --> 00:49:57,493
Simplified or traditional, you have to specify.

840
00:49:58,198 --> 00:50:00,339
Otherwise, it's just confusing.

841
00:50:00,679 --> 00:50:02,981
If I see a game saying, we support Chinese,

842
00:50:03,741 --> 00:50:05,542
then when I started playing the game,

843
00:50:05,682 --> 00:50:06,943
I will assume that I'm going to

844
00:50:07,764 --> 00:50:09,164
see traditional Chinese myself.

845
00:50:10,165 --> 00:50:12,406
But if it shows up in simplified Chinese,

846
00:50:12,706 --> 00:50:14,367
that actually can be a little bit annoying.

847
00:50:14,788 --> 00:50:16,489
And actually, it's vice versa.

848
00:50:17,909 --> 00:50:21,552
If you are using mainly simplified Chinese

849
00:50:21,632 --> 00:50:25,214
and you see a game saying we have it in Chinese,

850
00:50:26,863 --> 00:50:28,484
when it comes up as traditional,

851
00:50:29,145 --> 00:50:33,807
it will also feel a little bit disrespectful or annoying.

852
00:50:36,429 --> 00:50:37,630
Also, as a general idea,

853
00:50:37,990 --> 00:50:40,531
work with your localization service or translators.

854
00:50:40,791 --> 00:50:43,833
Provide them with enough context and references to work with.

855
00:50:45,494 --> 00:50:46,535
Get them hands on your game.

856
00:50:47,315 --> 00:50:49,376
If you have watched the movie Arrival,

857
00:50:50,217 --> 00:50:52,698
you would get idea what it means to be on the scene.

858
00:50:55,972 --> 00:50:58,194
If you haven't watched the movie Arrival, go watch it.

859
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:04,557
A spreadsheet full of just in-game text

860
00:51:04,818 --> 00:51:06,739
can sometimes be very hard to work with.

861
00:51:07,379 --> 00:51:10,681
Provide explanations for invented terms or special usages.

862
00:51:11,421 --> 00:51:15,023
Specify quote sources, joke sources,

863
00:51:16,064 --> 00:51:18,846
specify when you can allow translators

864
00:51:18,886 --> 00:51:21,747
to deviate from your original text

865
00:51:21,887 --> 00:51:24,689
to better fit a target audience, things like that.

866
00:51:27,399 --> 00:51:33,521
And fan translations. Not saying that you should solely rely on this, but it can actually happen.

867
00:51:34,302 --> 00:51:38,043
For example, there's a fan translated traditional Chinese version of the manual

868
00:51:38,663 --> 00:51:45,306
for the game Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes, which is like 20 or 30 pages of PDF.

869
00:51:46,826 --> 00:51:53,089
And also, one friend of mine in Taiwan helped on Epic with all its traditional Chinese translation

870
00:51:53,429 --> 00:51:53,769
60 years ago.

871
00:51:54,626 --> 00:51:58,990
just because he loved Unepic so much and happened to be a very professional translator himself.

872
00:52:02,773 --> 00:52:09,839
And again, in my opinion, political stuff a lot of times is not avoidable, as a few examples I've brought up today.

873
00:52:11,801 --> 00:52:17,726
What I'm trying to do here is present the situation to you and put these issues up on the table.

874
00:52:18,286 --> 00:52:23,090
I think at least this is beginning, this is a beginning for further communication.

875
00:52:23,941 --> 00:52:30,404
I'm perfectly comfortable with the possibility that all of you decide that you don't want to deal with Chinese localization anymore,

876
00:52:31,105 --> 00:52:36,727
or maybe you want to just give up on traditional Chinese and Taiwanese players in the future.

877
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:41,530
But at least now that's done a decision from insufficient information.

878
00:52:42,290 --> 00:52:45,332
I just want people to really recognize and understand that. That's all.

879
00:52:47,773 --> 00:52:49,574
Finally, we all know this is not easy at all.

880
00:52:51,164 --> 00:52:55,547
And as a game developer, it's difficult not to have the sentiment of like,

881
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:58,429
if only all people speak the same language.

882
00:53:02,051 --> 00:53:05,434
So as the final point I want to make today is that

883
00:53:06,735 --> 00:53:10,657
different languages and different cultures lead to diversity and uniqueness.

884
00:53:10,798 --> 00:53:17,182
And I think they are the crucial parts of innovation in games as art and games as media.

885
00:53:17,302 --> 00:53:20,705
So we can have more and more exciting new games in the future.

886
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:27,323
Every time I come to GDC, I'm always so impressed with the

887
00:53:27,863 --> 00:53:29,924
diversity and the inclusiveness here.

888
00:53:30,664 --> 00:53:33,965
I hope this talk brought you more insights into Chinese

889
00:53:34,045 --> 00:53:36,646
speaking regions and more understanding of our

890
00:53:36,706 --> 00:53:37,247
situation.

891
00:53:39,087 --> 00:53:41,988
A quick shout out to these friends who have been a great

892
00:53:42,028 --> 00:53:43,529
help during the preparation of this talk.

893
00:53:45,610 --> 00:53:46,170
And thank you.

894
00:53:46,370 --> 00:53:49,271
Please feel free, if you want to ask any questions, you can

895
00:53:49,972 --> 00:53:51,032
line up to the microphone there.

896
00:53:51,759 --> 00:53:55,101
I think we're...

897
00:53:55,121 --> 00:53:55,181
Hi.

898
00:53:55,982 --> 00:53:59,084
So my question is regarding the recent legislation

899
00:53:59,925 --> 00:54:03,448
for no foreign language in Chinese game.

900
00:54:04,328 --> 00:54:10,513
So specifically regarding credits and license text,

901
00:54:10,613 --> 00:54:13,235
sometimes there's legal license text for software,

902
00:54:13,275 --> 00:54:15,617
like an Apache license that you include in your credits.

903
00:54:17,279 --> 00:54:23,203
Is that generally just fine to have that verbatim in English as the original legal text was presented

904
00:54:23,243 --> 00:54:27,287
that you're required or is there going to be usually problems with credits and then also like

905
00:54:27,347 --> 00:54:28,488
English names and things like that?

906
00:54:29,569 --> 00:54:36,174
So for I think for documents that is not actually in the final version of the game.

907
00:54:36,970 --> 00:54:37,310
I think...

908
00:54:37,330 --> 00:54:41,372
So this would be like credits that are displayed in the game, like when...

909
00:54:41,792 --> 00:54:47,014
during credits and like the license text. It's in the game, it's not a part of the gameplay,

910
00:54:47,754 --> 00:54:48,895
but it is in the game, so...

911
00:54:51,856 --> 00:54:52,856
From my understanding,

912
00:54:54,097 --> 00:54:56,458
there are some exceptions to this, like...

913
00:54:58,258 --> 00:55:00,960
they will give exceptions to some of the technical...

914
00:55:01,940 --> 00:55:04,001
like the license documents you talked about.

915
00:55:05,401 --> 00:55:10,364
So from my friends' experiences before,

916
00:55:10,764 --> 00:55:15,547
they said there are some exceptions you can maybe tackle,

917
00:55:15,567 --> 00:55:19,989
but the problem is that you really have to just negotiate

918
00:55:20,229 --> 00:55:25,973
and try to go through this whole feedback

919
00:55:26,013 --> 00:55:26,973
and approval process.

920
00:55:28,554 --> 00:55:28,995
Cool, thank you.

921
00:55:32,502 --> 00:55:36,343
Hi, firstly, I'm here to say sorry about the Pro Evolution Soccer example,

922
00:55:36,363 --> 00:55:38,223
because I'm from the Pro Evolution team, so...

923
00:55:39,544 --> 00:55:39,804
Thank you.

924
00:55:39,824 --> 00:55:42,544
Sorry I didn't let you in the international competition.

925
00:55:42,985 --> 00:55:47,606
I remember there was a serious discussion going about the definition of international competition.

926
00:55:48,326 --> 00:55:52,367
So, sorry, I don't think this is a national competition.

927
00:55:52,427 --> 00:55:57,868
I think it's just I want to present this situation to you guys,

928
00:55:57,888 --> 00:56:00,228
because I don't think a lot of people actually...

929
00:56:00,997 --> 00:56:01,739
really know that.

930
00:56:01,819 --> 00:56:02,040
You know.

931
00:56:02,100 --> 00:56:02,341
Right.

932
00:56:02,782 --> 00:56:03,063
Yeah.

933
00:56:03,925 --> 00:56:07,073
So, okay, my question is about the approval process actually.

934
00:56:09,588 --> 00:56:18,172
My basic understanding is that the government is checking if all the known Chinese contexts are translated into Chinese language.

935
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:27,496
Do they even check if all the terms in the game are equivalent to what's common in Chinese?

936
00:56:28,017 --> 00:56:31,698
I mean, we are dealing with lots of football player names.

937
00:56:32,539 --> 00:56:39,103
for example, and we don't know what the official translated Chinese name for each player.

938
00:56:39,624 --> 00:56:42,366
So we are now struggling with that.

939
00:56:42,546 --> 00:56:51,572
And my question is just, do they even check the Pokemon example?

940
00:56:51,592 --> 00:56:58,377
Like, are those words different from what you use usually in your country?

941
00:56:58,437 --> 00:56:59,558
I don't think they will check that.

942
00:56:59,578 --> 00:57:00,098
Yeah.

943
00:57:00,459 --> 00:57:01,600
Yeah, I don't think so.

944
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:09,563
Okay, so they basically check if the context is translated in Chinese, like all the context.

945
00:57:10,423 --> 00:57:19,147
Yeah, so basically if you want to translate, I think they are like people's names or specific

946
00:57:19,187 --> 00:57:28,812
terms that may be used in China already, things like that. I think either you can look up those

947
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:29,272
and I...

948
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:36,901
So I think if it's not...

949
00:57:43,204 --> 00:57:43,944
Well, you got me there.

950
00:57:49,667 --> 00:57:59,191
So, like, you know, official translation for the support player's name, things like that.

951
00:58:00,992 --> 00:58:03,553
I don't think those will be enforced by the...

952
00:58:05,137 --> 00:58:15,382
China government. It may be enforced by representatives of, or maybe it's not reinforced,

953
00:58:16,302 --> 00:58:25,406
it can be just that if you have a name that is not a common one, people would not get it recognized.

954
00:58:25,426 --> 00:58:30,489
Okay. But I don't think that will get you blocked during the approval process.

955
00:58:30,509 --> 00:58:32,010
Okay. Yes.

956
00:58:32,170 --> 00:58:33,110
Okay. Thank you very much.

957
00:58:33,450 --> 00:58:33,610
Okay.

958
00:58:35,468 --> 00:58:35,669
OK.

959
00:58:36,449 --> 00:58:36,689
Sorry.

960
00:58:37,850 --> 00:58:42,312
So if you have other questions, you can just come up front.

961
00:58:42,412 --> 00:58:44,914
And thank you for your time today.

962
00:58:45,274 --> 00:58:47,655
And hope you have a, yeah.

963
00:58:48,356 --> 00:58:48,816
Thank you very much.
