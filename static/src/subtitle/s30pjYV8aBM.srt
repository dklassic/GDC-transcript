1
00:00:08,459 --> 00:00:14,164
Welcome everyone to Developing Terranil, a strategy game about nature, not expansion.

2
00:00:16,286 --> 00:00:18,047
Before we get started, just some introductions.

3
00:00:18,768 --> 00:00:19,949
My name is Sam Alfred.

4
00:00:20,429 --> 00:00:24,372
I'm the lead designer programmer on Terranil.

5
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,104
Being a programmer, this is probably more people than I talk to in a normal year.

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:36,888
I'm a bit nervous, but I think it'll be okay.

7
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:41,093
I work at a studio called Free Lives of dubious fame.

8
00:00:43,255 --> 00:00:44,936
These are some of our other titles.

9
00:00:45,817 --> 00:00:51,161
And we all live and work in the city of Cape Town in South Africa.

10
00:00:51,621 --> 00:00:59,286
And as I'll explain, where TerraNull was conceived and developed ended up being quite important to its design.

11
00:01:00,747 --> 00:01:09,874
And I just want to say that although I'm the one here giving the talk, TerraNull was developed by an amazing team of incredible people.

12
00:01:10,334 --> 00:01:13,176
And I just drew the short straw.

13
00:01:16,743 --> 00:01:30,751
So, hopefully most of you have at least seen some footage of Terranil, or it was supposed to be out by now, but game development being what it is, it's actually only coming out in six days.

14
00:01:31,612 --> 00:01:41,097
So Terranil's a hybrid strategy, puzzle, relaxation game where you're taking a wasteland to this.

15
00:01:43,298 --> 00:01:45,740
And in order to do that, you're using the

16
00:01:46,769 --> 00:01:54,545
The normal verbs of the city builder genre, you're constructing buildings, you're constructing machines, but there are some differences.

17
00:01:56,522 --> 00:02:02,225
Notably, and kind of what this talk is mostly about, Terrinal does not contain any of these things.

18
00:02:04,046 --> 00:02:20,155
It's generally a mainstay of the strategy genre that exploitation of resources is just a core part of the game and that you need to chop down forests so you can build your houses or mine rocks to build up your castle.

19
00:02:21,556 --> 00:02:22,717
Ternal doesn't have any of that.

20
00:02:23,338 --> 00:02:28,262
It also has no land colonization, which is another common mainstay of the genre.

21
00:02:29,063 --> 00:02:31,205
And it's not a game about unfettered expansion.

22
00:02:31,285 --> 00:02:37,391
It's a very finite game where once you completely restore an ecosystem, you move on.

23
00:02:37,511 --> 00:02:38,932
It's not a game you can play forever.

24
00:02:40,473 --> 00:02:45,278
That's not to say these are inherently bad or wrong, but that's not the kind of game we wanted to make.

25
00:02:48,191 --> 00:03:09,390
Just to go through the structure before we begin, what I'm going to be doing is I'm going to be telling the story of the game's development, and although presenting it in retrospect a lot seems obvious, the process was not always obvious, and at the risk of making a terrible pun, a lot of it grew organically.

26
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:19,676
Are we talking about what worked and what didn't in some of the lessons?

27
00:03:20,558 --> 00:03:24,645
And in order to illustrate this, I'll go through some of the pillars of our design.

28
00:03:26,047 --> 00:03:28,552
So let's start at the beginning.

29
00:03:31,312 --> 00:03:33,393
Terranil started at Ludum Dare.

30
00:03:35,193 --> 00:03:39,734
I can't say Ludum Dare with a straight face, so I say Ludum Dare.

31
00:03:40,654 --> 00:03:43,655
And the theme of that jam was Start With Nothing.

32
00:03:44,855 --> 00:03:49,877
The original prototype was a very literal interpretation of the theme.

33
00:03:51,677 --> 00:03:54,278
It was a piece of wasteland with nothing on it.

34
00:03:56,980 --> 00:04:02,464
And at the time I was playing a lot of Islanders, which if you haven't played it, you really should.

35
00:04:02,524 --> 00:04:05,347
It's this incredible minimalist city builder.

36
00:04:06,488 --> 00:04:11,872
But it's also really relaxing and doesn't have a lot of time pressure.

37
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,173
It's also not simulated.

38
00:04:14,574 --> 00:04:18,357
So I wanted to make something with these city builder style mechanics.

39
00:04:19,878 --> 00:04:20,680
but about nature.

40
00:04:22,083 --> 00:04:26,992
And instead of building a city or a factory, you were building an ecosystem.

41
00:04:28,194 --> 00:04:31,441
So just a warning, I'm about to show something really gross.

42
00:04:36,256 --> 00:04:37,978
This was the original plan.

43
00:04:40,559 --> 00:04:42,441
In my defense, it was a terrible camera.

44
00:04:42,741 --> 00:04:44,262
It was 3 a.m.

45
00:04:44,342 --> 00:04:45,063
local time.

46
00:04:45,243 --> 00:04:50,627
I'd been jamming for 48 hours, and I never thought I'd have to show it at GDC.

47
00:04:52,949 --> 00:04:56,471
I mostly just didn't want to lose it if I needed the whiteboard the next day.

48
00:04:58,132 --> 00:05:01,014
And it is illegible, so I will explain it.

49
00:05:02,233 --> 00:05:06,176
But before that, this was the result of the 48-hour jam.

50
00:05:08,217 --> 00:05:15,243
Had six buildings, and you would build them, and your goal was to cover 50% of the landscape in greenery.

51
00:05:15,983 --> 00:05:17,384
And this is how it worked.

52
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:23,769
So the beginning of a level, there were some rocks scattered around the map.

53
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,593
And on those rocks, you could build wind turbines, which would provide power.

54
00:05:28,633 --> 00:05:31,315
And you could only construct turbines on rocks.

55
00:05:32,403 --> 00:05:34,887
Power is important because it powers toxin scrubbers.

56
00:05:35,588 --> 00:05:46,443
Toxin scrubbers would clean the wasteland and create fertile soil, which was a necessary step, before creating greenhouses, which would then allow greenery to grow on the fertile soil.

57
00:05:48,373 --> 00:05:55,057
The greenery was both the thing that earned the currency and the goal of winning the game.

58
00:05:55,197 --> 00:06:01,440
So you were trying to cover 50% of the map in greenery, but you're also using the currency to construct more buildings.

59
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,881
And I'll talk a little bit more on the currency later.

60
00:06:05,362 --> 00:06:08,944
But there weren't enough rocks on the map to completely

61
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,908
reach the goal, so you needed a way to create more rocks.

62
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:27,953
And to do that, it was a rather complicated process of constructing an excavator, which would create straight riverbeds, and sometimes you would have to create more than one, and it ended up being this interesting spatial Tetris-y thing.

63
00:06:28,493 --> 00:06:35,836
And then those riverbeds could be filled with water using a water pump, and the water would

64
00:06:39,022 --> 00:06:44,123
create greenery on the riverbanks and also was used to power calcifiers which

65
00:06:45,672 --> 00:06:51,456
are very hand wavy game magic ways of turning plants into rocks.

66
00:06:54,378 --> 00:06:56,860
And then you could build more turbines on the rocks.

67
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,584
And so in this way, the rivers become like the veins of your operation.

68
00:07:01,644 --> 00:07:08,989
You have to get water where you need power so you can construct turbines and so on.

69
00:07:11,168 --> 00:07:13,857
And these were the results of that jam.

70
00:07:14,861 --> 00:07:15,563
It did pretty well.

71
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:26,845
for us anyway, at our studio, when a jam game does really well, Ludum Dare, we generally think it warrants further exploration.

72
00:07:26,905 --> 00:07:34,871
It's not necessarily a shoo-in for success, but it definitely means that we should be looking at it further.

73
00:07:34,931 --> 00:07:40,895
But I want to draw your attention to a couple of things here, most notably the graphics result.

74
00:07:41,275 --> 00:07:48,560
And so this original 48-hour prototype was full of program art, and I don't really think it

75
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,922
deserved first in graphics.

76
00:07:54,885 --> 00:07:57,247
I have a theory about why I got that.

77
00:07:57,567 --> 00:08:06,354
The idea is that players were just enjoying bringing life back to the barren wasteland.

78
00:08:06,455 --> 00:08:08,336
Players really like coloring in books.

79
00:08:08,836 --> 00:08:11,959
Players like turning something dirty into something clean.

80
00:08:11,979 --> 00:08:15,142
You just have to look at something like Power Wash Simulator to see this happen.

81
00:08:17,526 --> 00:08:20,412
And this can also be seen in the mood score a little bit.

82
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,901
But so it was quite promising.

83
00:08:25,102 --> 00:08:26,685
We decided to develop it a bit further.

84
00:08:29,127 --> 00:08:31,028
This was Terra Null then.

85
00:08:31,509 --> 00:08:33,370
It was a tiny sapling.

86
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:39,294
And yes, the guy talking about the tree game is going to shoehorn a tree metaphor into his talk.

87
00:08:42,496 --> 00:08:43,337
It's a building game.

88
00:08:43,417 --> 00:08:44,297
It's about nature.

89
00:08:45,138 --> 00:08:47,480
And we needed to figure out how to add to it.

90
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:50,141
The core loop was quite strong.

91
00:08:50,402 --> 00:08:51,502
It was mechanically sound.

92
00:08:51,562 --> 00:08:52,503
People were enjoying it.

93
00:08:53,123 --> 00:08:56,526
And attempts to make it longer or

94
00:08:57,827 --> 00:08:58,248
at all.

95
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:21,598
So to that effect, we decided, OK, what if we double down on the nature aspect?

96
00:09:22,059 --> 00:09:27,542
And in order to do so, there are sort of three things we need to consider.

97
00:09:28,783 --> 00:09:29,864
Nature's not homogenous.

98
00:09:30,224 --> 00:09:31,365
It's varied and diverse.

99
00:09:32,145 --> 00:09:33,026
It's full of cycles.

100
00:09:33,806 --> 00:09:38,010
And South Africa, where we come from, has this incredible natural heritage.

101
00:09:38,310 --> 00:09:40,552
This is a photograph from where we live.

102
00:09:40,572 --> 00:09:46,516
This is like, I don't know, 30 minutes hike out of the city.

103
00:09:51,468 --> 00:10:12,109
So on the first point, the original prototype had representations of water, soil, and greenery, and compare that to the complexity and diversity of flora in the world, to say nothing of animals and fauna, you know, you have

104
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:17,411
rivers with forests growing alongside them, which are full of biodiversity.

105
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:28,374
Wetlands are some of the most complex and important ecosystems on the planet, and even deserts are full of life that is specifically evolved to live there.

106
00:10:28,775 --> 00:10:40,158
And so we were never going to capture all of the nuance and all of the complexity of the natural world in a video game, but we could do better than just greenery.

107
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:47,791
So biodiversity then would be the next goal that we wanted our players to achieve.

108
00:10:49,192 --> 00:10:50,972
And this was kind of the first big lesson for us.

109
00:10:52,892 --> 00:10:56,333
This idea that your players will care about whatever metrics you decide to track.

110
00:10:57,193 --> 00:11:04,035
That is, we make biodiversity this goal of completing a level of Terra Null and

111
00:11:05,902 --> 00:11:07,722
then players will begin to care about it.

112
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:13,884
No one at any point ever questioned why you used green money to build buildings, even though it made no sense.

113
00:11:14,524 --> 00:11:19,325
You as a designer have the tools to tell your players what to care about.

114
00:11:20,005 --> 00:11:32,027
So if you want to make players care about something other than gold or population or health points or territory ownership, all you've got to do is you've got to build it into the way to win your game.

115
00:11:35,663 --> 00:11:40,506
On the second and third points, I need to take a brief biology tangent.

116
00:11:44,909 --> 00:11:51,892
and talk about a floral kingdom of wildflowers that exists around Cape Town, where we're from, called Faneborse.

117
00:11:53,973 --> 00:12:05,257
It's one of the biggest biodiversity hotspots in the world, and I want to talk about the protea flower specifically, which is the flower on the left.

118
00:12:06,197 --> 00:12:10,159
Protea flower is the national flower of South Africa, and it is pyrophytic.

119
00:12:10,859 --> 00:12:35,661
which means that it requires fire to germinate and protea flowers are super interesting where after they're pollinated they will actually close their petals and wait sometimes for years to be burned before opening and releasing their seeds and the reason they do this is so that all the grasses and the shrub beneath them is burned away and gives the seeds a better

120
00:12:36,201 --> 00:12:41,765
chance with less competition to grow into new plants, and also the ash is nutritious.

121
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:57,517
And over the course of development, I would go on to discover that, or we would go on to discover that this kind of process of burning, whether it's human initiated or natural, actually exists in many ecosystems all over the world, but this was our example in South Africa.

122
00:12:59,198 --> 00:13:01,159
So we found ourselves in a position where

123
00:13:02,332 --> 00:13:04,613
We want to make biodiversity a core part of the game.

124
00:13:05,193 --> 00:13:06,714
We can't break the existing loop.

125
00:13:07,614 --> 00:13:11,756
And we have this great example of life and death on our doorstep.

126
00:13:12,416 --> 00:13:16,038
And so we created another loop.

127
00:13:17,538 --> 00:13:21,561
at the thing that you do after the initial reclamation phase.

128
00:13:21,581 --> 00:13:31,667
So once you've reached a certain density of greenery and water, you would need to begin to diversify and improve the biodiversity of the landscape.

129
00:13:32,448 --> 00:13:39,492
So to do that, the map would start with a couple of dead trees, and on those trees you would construct beehives.

130
00:13:41,394 --> 00:13:48,561
And those beehives would create fynbos from the flowers, sorry, from the grasslands around them.

131
00:13:49,722 --> 00:14:01,412
You could use a solar amplifier, which is a unnecessarily complex way of starting a fire, to then create a controlled burn, which would result in

132
00:14:02,473 --> 00:14:04,254
ash and building husks.

133
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:11,057
You could then construct arboretums on the building husks, which would grow forests from the nutritious ash.

134
00:14:11,697 --> 00:14:15,759
And then those forests were full of trees that you could use to build more beehives.

135
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:18,080
So that's how that loop worked.

136
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:27,445
At the same time, we were specializing the greenhouses into hydroponiums, which could create wetlands.

137
00:14:29,537 --> 00:14:35,939
Hydroponiums could only be placed on low-lying ground near to rivers, and it would create wetlands.

138
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:39,380
And the other one is a biodome, and that was the opposite.

139
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:43,602
It would create arid plants, but it needed to be in a dry place, far from water.

140
00:14:44,362 --> 00:14:51,284
And all of these things together became the goal of the second phase of a level of pteranodon.

141
00:14:51,744 --> 00:14:53,625
You needed to improve the biodiversity.

142
00:14:56,175 --> 00:14:59,138
And this had some significant implications for the design.

143
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:06,307
Most notably, it became again about balance, which was sort of

144
00:15:08,191 --> 00:15:13,115
hand-in-hand with the idea of it being about nature, because nature is not about infinite growth.

145
00:15:13,295 --> 00:15:17,759
It's ecosystems naturally find an equilibrium and balance.

146
00:15:18,519 --> 00:15:20,621
And so the game is about balance.

147
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:25,265
If you use tiles for a wetland, implicitly you cannot grow a fynbos there.

148
00:15:25,625 --> 00:15:30,989
Or your forest, if there's too much forest, that's almost as bad as having not enough.

149
00:15:32,693 --> 00:15:35,414
Hand in hand with that is the idea that the game is finite.

150
00:15:37,115 --> 00:15:49,161
To this day, we still receive requests from players to expand the map to be able to buy more territory and that's completely contrary to the design of the game because if you run out of

151
00:15:50,242 --> 00:16:03,897
If you run out of land because you haven't created a good balance then you kind of ignored what the game is trying to tell you to do and if we let you then just buy more land so you could create the wetlands you missed out on kind of invalidates the philosophy.

152
00:16:06,018 --> 00:16:16,884
This would become our core design pillar, that we are not doing a whole lot of the things that are normally done in strategy games.

153
00:16:17,084 --> 00:16:18,985
So we need an alternative.

154
00:16:19,005 --> 00:16:20,066
We need a place to look.

155
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:26,890
And we would turn to nature for inspiration over the coming months and years.

156
00:16:30,282 --> 00:16:38,469
This is what a level of terrenal might have looked like at that point, and it looks good.

157
00:16:38,489 --> 00:16:44,254
You've got your wetland and your fynbos and your forests, but there was a looming problem here.

158
00:16:46,502 --> 00:16:49,244
And you get to see my fantastic editing skills.

159
00:16:50,325 --> 00:16:51,046
Copy paste.

160
00:16:53,188 --> 00:16:57,511
This might have been the result if we just added another layer of buildings.

161
00:16:57,891 --> 00:17:03,656
The thing about making a game where you take actions by building things is building things is your main verb.

162
00:17:04,177 --> 00:17:05,938
So we needed

163
00:17:07,940 --> 00:17:12,762
to keep building the same game, we need to keep the verb the same, and you need to keep building.

164
00:17:13,103 --> 00:17:23,729
But if you just kept building, then you would end up with something like this, where it's beginning to resemble a city or a factory or something like that, when really we wanted players to be focusing on the nature.

165
00:17:23,769 --> 00:17:28,291
So we needed to keep the verbs the same, but we needed to not add more buildings.

166
00:17:29,792 --> 00:17:36,497
So the kind of flash of inspiration came in the fact that Terranils never had a sell button.

167
00:17:37,258 --> 00:17:43,843
Terranils never had a sell button because, like Islanders, it's an order of operations puzzle.

168
00:17:43,883 --> 00:17:48,626
You have to build the toxin scrubbers before the greenhouses, otherwise it doesn't work.

169
00:17:49,607 --> 00:17:51,268
It's not simulated per se.

170
00:17:51,288 --> 00:17:54,991
That's why I call it sort of a half strategy, half hybrid puzzle game.

171
00:17:57,915 --> 00:18:09,906
But if we created buildings that could remove buildings, then we would be keeping the verbs the same, but also not adding more buildings to the landscape.

172
00:18:10,266 --> 00:18:15,390
And then once we made that connection, recycling became a natural extension of that idea.

173
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:18,973
Where does all the stuff go once you remove it?

174
00:18:19,794 --> 00:18:24,078
So the final phase of a level in TerraNL is the recycling phase.

175
00:18:26,040 --> 00:18:49,702
Recycle use these recycling beacons or recycling silos To recycle all of these buildings and then you would use You would use a loading port and Wally To to ship them to a rocket silo where they would get recycled into

176
00:18:50,856 --> 00:18:55,840
a rocket of recycled parts, and then you would blast off and leave the landscape behind.

177
00:18:56,060 --> 00:19:05,128
And it wasn't as mechanically deep as the previous two stages, and it was a little bit more of a victory lap, but that didn't really matter.

178
00:19:05,788 --> 00:19:11,433
And it didn't really matter that there were no buildings left, because you ended up with something like this.

179
00:19:12,754 --> 00:19:15,516
And that was great.

180
00:19:15,656 --> 00:19:16,417
Players loved that.

181
00:19:16,837 --> 00:19:18,378
You got to leave a paradise behind.

182
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:25,420
There's another mechanic involving weather that I haven't spoken about yet, but more on that later.

183
00:19:28,921 --> 00:19:39,085
So we add recycling to our mechanics pillar, and this was the result.

184
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:42,826
At this stage, TerraNode was still a free prototype on itch.io.

185
00:19:45,847 --> 00:19:47,828
That graph at the bottom is daily downloads.

186
00:19:51,376 --> 00:20:07,732
The first spike you see in January 2021 was the biodiversity update and then the second spike around June is the recycling update and it was really resonating with people that were making YouTube videos and getting excited about it.

187
00:20:08,733 --> 00:20:09,754
Still a free prototype.

188
00:20:12,987 --> 00:20:21,410
Watching people play, watching YouTubers, reading comments, we realized that what really resonated with people was the overall experience.

189
00:20:21,530 --> 00:20:23,771
It's the fantasy of cleaning up the wasteland.

190
00:20:24,392 --> 00:20:29,514
The puzzle mechanics were good, they were fine, but without the experience they wouldn't have been sufficient.

191
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:36,477
I don't think anyone would have been playing the game if not for the feelings they were getting with the experience of cleaning up.

192
00:20:38,109 --> 00:20:46,052
All of the pillars then became in support of this idea, this experience of restoring and healing a wasteland.

193
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:50,514
Right.

194
00:20:56,656 --> 00:20:59,277
So the game was promising.

195
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:04,539
It warranted progressing beyond the prototype phase.

196
00:21:07,257 --> 00:21:08,645
So we decided to...

197
00:21:12,208 --> 00:21:15,909
adopt it as a real game rather than just a free prototype.

198
00:21:18,409 --> 00:21:29,192
As I've said, we believe that it was the experience of playing Terrinal that was resonating with players, but we had these theories and we wanted to answer the questions.

199
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:38,753
We also had a large amount of tech debt because we were building from the Game Jam code base, which is never, ever a good idea.

200
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:49,678
And so naturally, we did what the most logical thing to do when you have a really promising game is we chucked it all out the window and started from scratch

201
00:21:54,730 --> 00:22:03,156
Central to the experience of restoring and this experience of restoration was not just the design though.

202
00:22:03,777 --> 00:22:13,644
I just want to make the point, and this is a design talk so I won't dwell on this for long, but the other disciplines were at least as important as the design and the mechanics.

203
00:22:15,164 --> 00:22:26,329
At this stage, the design was ahead, sort of, because we knew what we needed to rebuild, but we were trying to figure out what a better art direction was, we were trying to figure out the music and the sound design.

204
00:22:27,949 --> 00:22:33,892
And this was the most important lesson, really, that we learned making Terranil.

205
00:22:44,870 --> 00:22:47,952
So, talk a bit about music and sound quickly.

206
00:22:49,613 --> 00:22:55,857
Guy on the left there, his name is Maydan, he's our composer.

207
00:22:56,377 --> 00:22:58,778
He's not actually a Freelives employee.

208
00:22:59,799 --> 00:23:05,662
We used his free music in the prototype and it was so good that everyone kept asking us for the OST.

209
00:23:06,443 --> 00:23:09,124
So we decided, you know, we've got to have this guy.

210
00:23:10,365 --> 00:23:10,845
He had this

211
00:23:12,145 --> 00:23:17,850
incredible natural piano that evoked wonderful emotion.

212
00:23:18,551 --> 00:23:37,789
And at the same time we were working on a parallel ambience prototype, which is that picture on the right there, where, and this made it into the final game, the cursor internal acts like a microphone where there's spatial audio based on the current

213
00:23:39,437 --> 00:23:51,008
vegetation around your mouse cursor, but also the buildings, so that moving your mouse cursor from ocean to beach to wetland to forest, you'll hear something different every time.

214
00:23:51,088 --> 00:23:56,292
And so we have this physical instrument and physical sound coming into the game.

215
00:23:57,313 --> 00:24:01,978
At the same time, we were pursuing some art experiments.

216
00:24:05,017 --> 00:24:13,385
It was a beautiful game about nature, so we were like, everyone loves Ghibli, we love Ghibli, let's make it look like Ghibli.

217
00:24:15,827 --> 00:24:17,688
These are some of those early experiments.

218
00:24:19,550 --> 00:24:28,898
The one on the left there, you can see is very sort of anime inspired, and that had a big problem though, because with that kind of art direction,

219
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:48,407
backgrounds fade back and the foreground elements and the important elements that the player plays with are generally cel-shaded and they're much more noticeable and that's kind of the opposite of what we wanted for Terra Null is that the buildings ended up dominating when we wanted the nature to be at front and center.

220
00:24:49,247 --> 00:24:54,829
And then on the right there you can see an early 3D prototype and that was cool.

221
00:24:54,849 --> 00:24:59,051
That gave us a lot of confidence in the idea of moving away from pixel art because

222
00:25:00,091 --> 00:25:05,033
Pixel art inherently, because of its nature, it's all jagged edges.

223
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:10,876
And this gave us softer shadows and softer curves everywhere.

224
00:25:11,256 --> 00:25:14,438
And in that one, nature was balanced much better with the buildings.

225
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,141
So these are some more of the art experiments.

226
00:25:21,901 --> 00:25:22,962
And on the right-hand side,

227
00:25:24,298 --> 00:25:30,626
was a diorama we created to kind of test the waters of the new art style against our community.

228
00:25:32,048 --> 00:25:38,817
And unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, it got mixed responses.

229
00:25:38,917 --> 00:25:40,459
People weren't so fond of it.

230
00:25:44,039 --> 00:26:05,108
part of that was they missed the iconic wind turbines and the way we understood that was here's this real-world anchor that it's a fantasy but there's this real-world anchor that allows people to understand and relate to what's happening in the game and I also want to draw your attention to the

231
00:26:05,888 --> 00:26:34,069
the bottom left of that image where you see some conveyor belts and concrete walls overgrown with greenery and we were busy trying to figure out the story of the world and what had happened and was it important and what we decided was it's not a game about everything that had gone wrong in the world and hitting our players over the head with

232
00:26:35,766 --> 00:26:42,673
Oh, industry has ruined the planet and now it's up to you to fix it was kind of contrary to the philosophy and the feeling we were going for.

233
00:26:45,636 --> 00:26:49,900
What had happened to the world was less important than what the player was going to be able to achieve.

234
00:26:50,561 --> 00:26:53,484
And so in the end, we didn't have any of that stuff.

235
00:26:53,904 --> 00:26:56,267
We just had these barren wastelands.

236
00:26:57,528 --> 00:26:59,109
Around the same time, this was

237
00:27:00,509 --> 00:27:11,952
When most of the global lockdowns were happening, we were beginning to see reports out of New Delhi that they could see mountains that had not been visible for 50 years.

238
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:20,374
We read this blog post by someone from Manila who played Terranil and was arguing that

239
00:27:22,079 --> 00:27:36,071
Terranil worked, and this being the pixel art version of Terranil, because it embraced the fact that it's not the responsibility of individuals to restore the problems of industry.

240
00:27:36,151 --> 00:27:39,374
It's the responsibility of industry to restore the problem of industry.

241
00:27:39,514 --> 00:27:42,717
And industrial problems require industrial-sized solutions.

242
00:27:43,197 --> 00:27:44,058
And that really sort of

243
00:27:45,819 --> 00:28:02,406
made us think about the fact that we had these dinky Ghibli styled windmills and things when actually we needed to be embracing the fact that this is a hard problem and presenting it as needing sophisticated tools and resources was much better.

244
00:28:03,946 --> 00:28:07,328
The other thing that was happening was we were realizing this game is

245
00:28:09,551 --> 00:28:13,193
This game is a conduit for climate positivity.

246
00:28:13,793 --> 00:28:18,335
People playing the game have often told us that it helps ease their climate anxiety.

247
00:28:18,755 --> 00:28:28,719
It helps them feel agency that they can do something about the climate crisis, even though it's a fantasy and it's made up.

248
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:34,442
It gives you the idea that, hey, maybe we can do something about this.

249
00:28:34,822 --> 00:28:37,143
And so those things go hand in hand with each other.

250
00:28:40,908 --> 00:28:44,291
And so this is sort of where we settled in terms of art direction.

251
00:28:44,731 --> 00:28:56,220
It ended up being more industrial, more painterly, less obviously Ghibli influenced, and more focused on the nature.

252
00:28:58,413 --> 00:29:11,503
And we were beginning to see that there was a third pillar to our design, which was the idea of emotion in design, and that this wasn't necessarily something we started, set out to.

253
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:26,455
It's not necessarily something we set out to do, but realizing that the emotional aspect of the game was really important, at least as important as the mechanics, meant that it became the third pillar of our design.

254
00:29:28,516 --> 00:29:37,544
And just because the design was mostly just copying what the prototype had already done doesn't mean there wasn't some innovation also happening in design land.

255
00:29:42,069 --> 00:29:43,370
We added a rain mechanic.

256
00:29:45,956 --> 00:29:55,099
where initially this was mechanically motivated because it's a strategy game and there's a lot of min-maxing.

257
00:29:55,259 --> 00:30:01,402
You want to make sure that you get the best bang for buck.

258
00:30:01,722 --> 00:30:04,443
You don't spend your resources restoring something

259
00:30:05,123 --> 00:30:07,805
a small piece of wasteland.

260
00:30:08,485 --> 00:30:16,950
And so what ended up happening is by towards the end of a level, players would have these horrible little holes in their landscape where there was still wasteland.

261
00:30:17,411 --> 00:30:28,458
And so we created a rain mechanic and a climate mechanic where once you restored the local weather system, it would start raining and then it would fill in the gaps.

262
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:36,229
And as I said, it started as a mechanical thing, but it ended up being unexpectedly emotional.

263
00:30:37,990 --> 00:30:43,313
It was almost like the game was saying to players, you've done enough.

264
00:30:44,473 --> 00:30:45,614
Nature will take it from here.

265
00:30:51,465 --> 00:31:00,407
And this was a little bit of a revelation that the design could also support moments of beauty and the features didn't all have to be mechanical in nature.

266
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:18,070
So, as I was saying, we restarted the game and we put it out on Steam Next Fest and it blew up.

267
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,730
It was way, way more

268
00:31:22,567 --> 00:31:25,162
have way more traction than any of us expected.

269
00:31:26,912 --> 00:31:32,394
When we put out the announcement trailer, all of us, including our publishers at Devolver, were like, what?

270
00:31:36,715 --> 00:31:43,276
We got in touch with Netflix, and we started talking to them about, or they got in touch with us, actually.

271
00:31:44,457 --> 00:31:47,338
And they started talking to us about doing a mobile version.

272
00:31:49,178 --> 00:31:53,899
And watching people play the demo, the Steam Next Fest demo had about 100,000 plays in a week.

273
00:31:58,973 --> 00:32:03,815
people were talking about the emotions and the feelings and not the mechanics.

274
00:32:04,035 --> 00:32:06,136
So I want to read out one of these.

275
00:32:08,677 --> 00:32:14,020
It was lovely to see the barren wasteland start to come back to life as I tended to the soil and the climate.

276
00:32:14,760 --> 00:32:19,762
Then a storm rolled in and it started to rain, and I was a little overcome with emotion.

277
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:23,664
We started wanting to make a strategy game.

278
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:39,681
This was not the direction that we originally intended going, but we ended up trying to listen to what people were really enjoying.

279
00:32:41,282 --> 00:32:54,225
In order to respond to the overwhelmingly much larger response than we anticipated, we decided we needed to go back to the drawing board and make the game a bit broader.

280
00:32:56,567 --> 00:32:56,707
like

281
00:33:13,496 --> 00:33:30,453
To go back to this idea of looking at nature for inspiration, we looked at the Koppen-Geiger climate classification system, which is the classification system of five broad categories and about 16 subcategories of biomes on Earth.

282
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:34,657
And we thought, wouldn't it be cool if we can make one level for each

283
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:44,629
broad category, and those being the temperate, tropical, polar, continental, and arid.

284
00:33:45,410 --> 00:33:50,316
And you only see three here, because I've showed you one already, and the fifth one was cut because game dev.

285
00:33:56,796 --> 00:34:07,221
And in the end we decided we were only going to have one level per region, which was a difficult decision to make, and I'm still not sure it was the right one.

286
00:34:07,861 --> 00:34:09,062
We'll find out in six days.

287
00:34:11,883 --> 00:34:34,235
But the idea there is people loved the nature aspect, people loved seeing new environments, and so we didn't want to overstay our welcome anywhere and make multiple levels in one region, because each region had brand new mechanics, brand new biomes, brand new animal species, brand new buildings.

288
00:34:39,082 --> 00:34:48,379
And so I want to give you some examples of other ways we kind of followed the guiding star of using nature as inspiration when we were expanding the content.

289
00:34:52,438 --> 00:34:56,441
So the first is to do with coral restoration projects.

290
00:34:58,122 --> 00:35:11,753
This is a real life conservation technique where I'm sure many of you know that coral reefs all over the world are dying due to increases in sea water temperature and

291
00:35:13,916 --> 00:35:16,639
There's coral bleaching due to acidification.

292
00:35:16,979 --> 00:35:30,291
And in the restoration of coral reefs, what conservationists often do is they will create these like pools of seawater on land with steel frames immersed in the water.

293
00:35:30,311 --> 00:35:37,217
And for some reason that maybe someone who knows the stuff better than I do could tell you, coral really likes growing on steel.

294
00:35:38,578 --> 00:35:44,742
and in some places they even sink old World War I battleships to create artificial reefs as a result.

295
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:57,711
But using these steel frames you can take an existing coral, a piece of live existing coral, and through a process called microfracturing you can spread it out and then make it adhere to the frame.

296
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:03,436
and this increases the surface area of the coral and allows it to grow a lot faster.

297
00:36:04,076 --> 00:36:11,522
And then once it's matured that entire frame can be dropped in the ocean and over time the coral will just grow over the original frame.

298
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:20,027
And so the way we codified this in a video game is we have this coral lab which is built

299
00:36:20,888 --> 00:36:22,850
which is built on top of a greenhouse.

300
00:36:24,191 --> 00:36:27,593
It's part of our phase two in the tropical region.

301
00:36:28,854 --> 00:36:36,220
And what you do is there's a monorail system in the tropical level that you then use to transport this into the ocean.

302
00:36:38,722 --> 00:36:43,206
On the top right, you can see that was our geothermal power plant.

303
00:36:43,526 --> 00:36:48,770
And yes, I'm aware that geothermal power plants aren't really built on lava fields.

304
00:36:51,984 --> 00:36:53,945
It was too good an image not to include.

305
00:36:58,527 --> 00:37:07,231
We wanted to have other kinds of renewable energy in the game, and Geothermal Power presented this interesting scenario where lava

306
00:37:08,683 --> 00:37:20,716
kind of behaves like water in the game but it's also a lot more tricky and can cause ash and fire and there's interesting mechanics around that.

307
00:37:22,062 --> 00:37:25,483
And the third example at the bottom is kelp forest.

308
00:37:27,124 --> 00:37:30,285
We also drew inspiration from real-life conservation techniques.

309
00:37:31,485 --> 00:37:36,887
Kelp forests often lose their habitats to purple sea urchins.

310
00:37:37,907 --> 00:37:39,287
Kelp needs to grow on a rock.

311
00:37:42,250 --> 00:37:42,290
is

312
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:08,954
used to be populations of sea otters who naturally eat purple sea urchins, keeping those populations in check and meaning that kelp forests can continue to grow.

313
00:38:09,474 --> 00:38:14,020
And then in turn, the sea otters live in the kelp forest, provide protection from predators, etc.

314
00:38:16,482 --> 00:38:24,447
So in Terra Null, we have kelp forests that you can then create sea otters to live in the kelp forests.

315
00:38:25,167 --> 00:38:33,612
And this is just a couple of other examples of looking at the natural world conservation techniques for inspiration of mechanics.

316
00:38:38,275 --> 00:38:41,957
So we add regional diversity to the mechanics side.

317
00:38:44,249 --> 00:38:47,873
Yeah, read ice level, I guess.

318
00:38:49,855 --> 00:38:53,659
But I do want to talk a little bit about what didn't work because it wasn't all smooth sailing.

319
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:59,625
This was our most developed thing that we had to chuck out.

320
00:39:00,185 --> 00:39:04,049
This was an attempt to create a loadout system and a meta game.

321
00:39:06,572 --> 00:39:07,493
I feel like it's the

322
00:39:09,315 --> 00:39:11,656
purview of every strategy game designer ever.

323
00:39:11,716 --> 00:39:14,498
That game would be improved with a meta game, but anyway.

324
00:39:16,559 --> 00:39:21,903
Loadout didn't work, and there are sort of three reasons why I think it didn't work.

325
00:39:22,383 --> 00:39:38,353
The first is that loadouts work really well when you have lots of different things that do the same thing differently, i.e., you have lots of towers that all deal damage to creeps, but in different ways.

326
00:39:39,278 --> 00:39:44,162
whereas in Terra Null you have lots of different things that do different things differently.

327
00:39:46,123 --> 00:39:59,873
It didn't really make sense when everything was so specifically localized to give players the option to choose what they wanted because they would always just choose the same stuff.

328
00:40:01,840 --> 00:40:07,845
Two, it was contrary to what was making the game good and what people were enjoying about the game.

329
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:13,570
I don't think I ever saw a comment or a tweet that said, geez, you know what, this game could need a metagame.

330
00:40:13,790 --> 00:40:15,611
Yeah.

331
00:40:16,692 --> 00:40:19,475
And three, we had no time.

332
00:40:19,755 --> 00:40:26,060
We had quite a stringent externally imposed deadline.

333
00:40:30,336 --> 00:40:45,590
Deadlines have a way of sharpening your priorities and as such this just kept getting pushed to the bottom of the list and it kept getting smaller and smaller and eventually we decided to do a level select thing instead.

334
00:40:48,424 --> 00:40:51,365
There were some mechanics that worked just about well enough.

335
00:40:52,105 --> 00:40:53,606
They're still a bit icky, but whatever.

336
00:40:54,766 --> 00:41:00,308
This is our first powers and then abilities iteration.

337
00:41:00,989 --> 00:41:14,293
We realized quite late in development that we had to add a second verb to the game that, as wonderful and elegant as it would have been to only have the one verb of building buildings to influence the game state,

338
00:41:16,114 --> 00:41:19,295
We needed some buildings to be able to do a second action.

339
00:41:21,376 --> 00:41:23,016
And it felt ugly.

340
00:41:23,757 --> 00:41:30,039
It felt like at the end of the game there are only a handful of buildings that have this mechanic.

341
00:41:30,579 --> 00:41:31,799
But it was kind of necessary.

342
00:41:35,208 --> 00:41:39,851
In the end, mechanics just needed to be good enough to support the experience.

343
00:41:41,011 --> 00:41:48,235
With the experience being the most important thing, we put the bullet and made something a bit ugly.

344
00:41:52,477 --> 00:41:55,499
This is our appreciate mode.

345
00:41:55,539 --> 00:41:59,321
This was added right at the end of development.

346
00:42:02,008 --> 00:42:06,551
What happens here is, once you finish a level, you get the opportunity to appreciate it.

347
00:42:07,672 --> 00:42:17,258
This is both to appreciate nature, but also to appreciate your hard work, and it has these close-ups and these far-outs.

348
00:42:21,360 --> 00:42:28,141
And we never would have bothered with a feature like this if we weren't listening to the game, because it's not a gameplay mechanic.

349
00:42:28,441 --> 00:42:33,082
It's a feature to allow people to enjoy more what they're already enjoying.

350
00:42:33,862 --> 00:42:38,403
So it's like this slow nature documentary style of thing.

351
00:42:41,083 --> 00:42:50,045
So that would be the final point on our emotional pillars, this idea of relaxation and appreciation, to appreciate

352
00:42:51,604 --> 00:42:52,326
what you have done.

353
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:07,942
On the flip side, it was really important for the game to be a bit challenging, that you're restoring a barren wasteland.

354
00:43:08,102 --> 00:43:13,083
You're trying to bring life back to a place where life hasn't lived for I don't know how long.

355
00:43:14,223 --> 00:43:17,644
If it didn't feel difficult, it wouldn't feel earned.

356
00:43:18,184 --> 00:43:24,885
If we just gave players a paintbrush and said, you can paint whatever you want, you can just place these flowers over here,

357
00:43:25,845 --> 00:43:27,967
wouldn't have had the same emotional resonance.

358
00:43:28,387 --> 00:43:37,614
So this balance between the relaxing elements and the challenge elements of Terranol actually became one of the most difficult parts of the design.

359
00:43:37,794 --> 00:43:44,580
And balancing those things against each other, yeah, I hope we got it right.

360
00:43:48,483 --> 00:43:51,886
So this is the final picture of the design.

361
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:57,695
We have the mechanics on the left, nature in the middle, and emotions on the right.

362
00:44:07,861 --> 00:44:13,525
So, to sum up, these are the main takeaways for us.

363
00:44:15,137 --> 00:44:16,798
Genre rules exist for a reason.

364
00:44:17,998 --> 00:44:38,349
If you're going to decide to not follow the established rules of a genre, you better have something to replace them, because even though we had this idea of following nature and looking to nature for inspiration to replace what we were losing from ignoring all the normal rules of strategy games,

365
00:44:38,849 --> 00:44:41,430
Oftentimes we just felt like we were completely without a rudder.

366
00:44:41,850 --> 00:44:42,790
We didn't know what to do.

367
00:44:43,050 --> 00:45:01,434
They're just trying to figure it out so even then They're there for a reason and you need to have a really good reason to ignore them and If you do you need to find something to replace them You have you could

368
00:45:02,418 --> 00:45:08,442
And we have probably alienated quite a lot of the strategy game audience as a result.

369
00:45:09,063 --> 00:45:21,771
People who like playing games where you build the same city for many hundreds of hours will probably, well, I don't know, maybe they'll like Terrinal, but it's very different to what they might expect.

370
00:45:23,072 --> 00:45:31,158
But hopefully, by not adhering too closely to the rules of the genre, we can also begin to cultivate a new audience.

371
00:45:32,543 --> 00:45:38,350
And finally, and I've been saying this throughout the talk, everything in the game should be in service of the experience.

372
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:45,378
Nothing is above the experience, whether that be mechanics and design, or art direction, or audio.

373
00:45:47,941 --> 00:45:50,504
More lessons.

374
00:45:53,379 --> 00:45:56,302
As I said in the beginning, players care about the resources you track.

375
00:45:56,502 --> 00:46:00,466
If you tell them something is important, they will care about it.

376
00:46:00,486 --> 00:46:05,190
There's no reason you have to have population as the resource you track.

377
00:46:05,250 --> 00:46:09,234
You can have a different resource you track, and players will care about it.

378
00:46:09,974 --> 00:46:12,537
Players like coloring in books.

379
00:46:12,677 --> 00:46:14,839
They like filling in gaps.

380
00:46:14,999 --> 00:46:17,141
They like making things dirty clean.

381
00:46:18,649 --> 00:46:20,150
making things dead alive.

382
00:46:21,191 --> 00:46:30,156
And finally, suboptimal design, like our ability system, which still feels pretty dirty to me, is okay if it supports the experience.

383
00:46:30,636 --> 00:46:34,679
Because nothing is above the experience, it's okay to make those concessions.

384
00:46:36,660 --> 00:46:41,623
And I'm slightly short on time, but that is what I have for you.

385
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:58,108
Thank you for an amazing presentation.

386
00:46:58,308 --> 00:47:03,610
This is eye-opening, like insanely smart with a mouse cursor, like tracking the sounds.

387
00:47:04,250 --> 00:47:04,991
My mind is blown.

388
00:47:05,511 --> 00:47:09,953
I have a question that maybe goes a little bit beyond your talk, but I think it's also quite fitting to your lessons.

389
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:15,095
Do you think in order to be able to pull this off in the real world, we need to change the currency that we're tracking?

390
00:47:18,457 --> 00:47:23,639
And so you asked if we want to pull this off in the real world, we have to change the currency we're tracking.

391
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:24,379
Yes.

392
00:47:25,916 --> 00:47:26,196
Thank you.

393
00:47:31,080 --> 00:47:33,182
So I have a less profound question.

394
00:47:33,242 --> 00:47:34,664
Thank you again for your talk.

395
00:47:36,385 --> 00:47:46,153
I can't believe I haven't heard of this game until today because I am currently in still very game jam rudderless level prototyping stages of a similar idea.

396
00:47:46,974 --> 00:47:53,036
where instead of starting with a city builder and turning it into a nature game, I'm starting with Minecraft and turning it into a nature game.

397
00:47:53,196 --> 00:47:53,396
Right.

398
00:47:54,236 --> 00:48:09,440
And I'm encountering a lot of these same problems that you've been saying about feeling rudderless and feeling like there's a lot of discussion to be had about, like, avoiding the comfortable mechanics of your genre.

399
00:48:09,800 --> 00:48:14,862
Like, how much do you have to concede to the idea of, like, you're still building buildings.

400
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:17,973
but they're in the service of this larger goal.

401
00:48:18,253 --> 00:48:18,453
Yes.

402
00:48:18,733 --> 00:48:38,881
And I guess my question is sort of how do you navigate that internal or social experience of deciding when to concede to comfortable game mechanics and when you really want to force the experience and what is too comfortable and what is too far in the other direction

403
00:48:39,488 --> 00:48:48,937
Right, so you're basically asking how to find the line between what genre norms do you accept and what do you not.

404
00:48:49,017 --> 00:48:52,060
Do I put a furnace in my game is sort of the summary of my question.

405
00:48:52,080 --> 00:48:53,522
Right, do you put a furnace in your game.

406
00:48:54,209 --> 00:48:58,211
Well, our feeling anyway is that you can't change everything, right?

407
00:49:00,352 --> 00:49:08,016
The innovation happens when there is some familiarity for people to latch on to.

408
00:49:08,376 --> 00:49:12,759
But then, once you have that familiarity, you can then begin to challenge things.

409
00:49:14,279 --> 00:49:17,321
So, do you put a furnace in your game?

410
00:49:17,541 --> 00:49:19,642
I'll have to maybe think about that.

411
00:49:22,003 --> 00:49:22,684
I would say that

412
00:49:23,851 --> 00:49:32,756
Pick a pillar, whether it's controls, mechanics, whatever, and make that familiar, and then try to change something else.

413
00:49:33,196 --> 00:49:37,658
But also, what we discovered with Terra Null is we did a lot of testing it in the real world.

414
00:49:39,179 --> 00:49:46,443
When we had it on itch.io, it was free, and we just saw what people were enjoying.

415
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,986
So that also is a valuable way of gaining more data.

416
00:49:53,047 --> 00:49:53,307
Thank you.

417
00:49:56,775 --> 00:49:57,636
Hi, thanks so much.

418
00:49:57,776 --> 00:50:01,578
It was a really interesting talk, and I'm so excited to play the final build of the game.

419
00:50:02,298 --> 00:50:08,462
I wonder if you could talk a little bit more about your process of translating research into mechanics.

420
00:50:08,642 --> 00:50:21,970
I was really intrigued by some of the little scientific details that you were talking about, and I'm curious how you came upon those and how you worked with that data, I guess, in conversation with your design process.

421
00:50:22,355 --> 00:50:23,175
Sure, sure.

422
00:50:23,296 --> 00:50:34,141
So in order to translate some real-world techniques into mechanics, we generally, as I said, we started with wanting multiple regions to the game.

423
00:50:34,621 --> 00:50:42,465
And what we would do is when we got a new region, we would try and do some research about what grows there, what lives there.

424
00:50:44,252 --> 00:50:48,274
Is there anything weird and interesting and unique about it?

425
00:50:48,895 --> 00:50:54,978
Is there some weird process we've never heard of that we can then turn into a mechanic?

426
00:50:56,259 --> 00:51:01,522
And in some cases that there was, and in other cases we had to come up with stuff.

427
00:51:02,083 --> 00:51:10,768
But it was mainly just because we had this idea of we want to try and represent the real world, we could just

428
00:51:12,677 --> 00:51:17,663
look and research that particular region and then see what we can find.

429
00:51:19,505 --> 00:51:20,486
Yeah, that's really interesting.

430
00:51:20,506 --> 00:51:20,786
Thank you.

431
00:51:23,969 --> 00:51:24,210
Cool.

432
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:24,970
Anyone else?

433
00:51:27,874 --> 00:51:28,695
Well, thank you.
