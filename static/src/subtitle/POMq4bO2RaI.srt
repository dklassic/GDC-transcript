00:00:00,791 --> 00:00:06,157
Hi everyone, welcome to the GDC Twitch channel, my name is Bryant Francis, I am the community

2
00:00:06,197 --> 00:00:10,442
manager for GDC, I'm a contributing editor at Gamasutra.com.

3
00:00:11,182 --> 00:00:17,549
I am here today, being my little astronaut self on this nice lovely planet, sort of got

4
00:00:17,569 --> 00:00:20,012
myself set up here, kind of on a weird like...

5
00:00:20,813 --> 00:00:25,315
border of the planet between the green and the blue.

6
00:00:25,335 --> 00:00:25,996
That's not red.

7
00:00:26,016 --> 00:00:27,777
I'm not colorblind, I swear.

8
00:00:28,237 --> 00:00:35,181
Anyway, we are here today talking to Brendan from System Era.

9
00:00:35,941 --> 00:00:37,682
He is in the lower left-hand corner of the screen.

10
00:00:38,283 --> 00:00:40,484
And also joining me is Alex Warrow.

11
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,965
Alex, would you please introduce yourself?

12
00:00:42,825 --> 00:00:43,086
Hi.

13
00:00:43,866 --> 00:00:44,847
I'm Alex, somehow still.

14
00:00:45,922 --> 00:00:51,003
I'm an editor at GammaStudio.com, and I'm very pleased to join you today on this special

15
00:00:51,063 --> 00:00:51,803
GDC stream.

16
00:00:52,704 --> 00:00:53,564
But I'm pretty boring.

17
00:00:53,904 --> 00:00:55,464
Brendan, you're our interesting guest.

18
00:00:55,484 --> 00:00:59,185
Can you tell everyone a little bit more about who you are and what you do at System Era?

19
00:00:59,866 --> 00:01:01,306
Yeah, I'm Brendan Wilson.

20
00:01:01,346 --> 00:01:03,667
I'm one of the original co-founders of System Era.

21
00:01:04,827 --> 00:01:10,569
I was basically the lead engineer for quite a while, and I still do a bunch of engineering

22
00:01:10,629 --> 00:01:14,530
on the game, but I have transitioned to be more of just kind of the studio head.

23
00:01:16,132 --> 00:01:17,753
And so I handle a whole lot of things.

24
00:01:18,913 --> 00:01:20,833
Basically anything at the studio that he's doing

25
00:01:20,853 --> 00:01:24,514
that doesn't fit into anyone else's job description,

26
00:01:24,554 --> 00:01:25,454
that's what I'm managing.

27
00:01:27,595 --> 00:01:30,175
Right on. So I think what's interesting about this game

28
00:01:30,215 --> 00:01:33,356
is it just launched out of early access last week,

29
00:01:33,396 --> 00:01:34,296
I think, right? The 6th?

30
00:01:34,316 --> 00:01:35,396
Yeah.

31
00:01:35,756 --> 00:01:37,237
And you guys have been working on this for years.

32
00:01:37,377 --> 00:01:38,957
I think a little over two, right?

33
00:01:38,977 --> 00:01:41,058
You launched in early access in December of 2016.

34
00:01:41,118 --> 00:01:43,958
How has it gone for you this first week?

35
00:01:46,279 --> 00:01:50,921
But at 1.0, what's been the reception, how's the studio been working, how's it going?

36
00:01:51,461 --> 00:01:55,402
Yeah, it's been a little more than two years since we announced the game, but that was

37
00:01:55,642 --> 00:01:58,943
October of 2015, I want to say.

38
00:02:01,003 --> 00:02:05,464
But the game has actually been, from conception, the game has been in progress for five years.

39
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:12,866
And I think the reception at 1.0 has been really positive, really encouraging.

40
00:02:14,264 --> 00:02:19,487
and it's kind of really been, we had to kind of go dark for a few months to really focus

41
00:02:19,767 --> 00:02:21,469
on getting the content ready and out.

42
00:02:22,409 --> 00:02:27,513
And it's been our most significant update, like through all of our early access updates,

43
00:02:27,613 --> 00:02:32,917
this one, the difference in the game from what we had in October to now, it's been the

44
00:02:32,957 --> 00:02:33,577
most drastic.

45
00:02:34,158 --> 00:02:38,341
And so that's, it was really nice to give players that kind of big jump in content.

46
00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:43,131
And obviously, it hasn't gone entirely smoothly,

47
00:02:43,211 --> 00:02:47,653
but lots of bugs to fix and performance to improve.

48
00:02:47,713 --> 00:02:49,474
And that's currently our top priority.

49
00:02:50,674 --> 00:02:52,595
But it's been very exciting for the team, especially

50
00:02:52,615 --> 00:02:54,316
for most of the team who haven't been here

51
00:02:54,336 --> 00:02:56,157
since the beginning, because we've grown quite a bit.

52
00:02:56,917 --> 00:02:58,017
It's really exciting for them to be

53
00:02:58,057 --> 00:03:01,959
able to see a lot of work finally in players' hands

54
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:03,200
and get the reactions.

55
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:04,180
Yeah.

56
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:07,283
I was derelict in my duties earlier.

57
00:03:07,303 --> 00:03:11,205
I should have pointed out that everyone watching this fantastic stream can go ahead and drop

58
00:03:11,245 --> 00:03:15,406
questions for you in chat, and we'll go ahead and relay them, although we definitely prefer

59
00:03:15,466 --> 00:03:17,727
questions about game development or this game in particular.

60
00:03:18,728 --> 00:03:24,470
We already have a couple that are fantastic, one of which from Overbwane is, what is it

61
00:03:24,510 --> 00:03:27,271
like to be working on a game that's live and actively responded to?

62
00:03:28,432 --> 00:03:30,653
Which is a very broad question, but a good one.

63
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:33,311
So how's it been for you, like working on a game

64
00:03:33,331 --> 00:03:35,892
that's sort of been open and in public development

65
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:36,532
for years now?

66
00:03:38,333 --> 00:03:39,533
It's hard.

67
00:03:39,713 --> 00:03:42,574
I would say it doubles the challenge

68
00:03:43,214 --> 00:03:47,435
because when you're not, you know,

69
00:03:47,475 --> 00:03:49,736
when you're working on a game that is unannounced

70
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,297
or is at least, you know, it's just not in players' hands,

71
00:03:52,317 --> 00:03:54,798
you can just break everything every day, you know,

72
00:03:55,958 --> 00:03:57,898
and or if something's not working,

73
00:03:57,938 --> 00:03:59,739
just completely throw it out, redesign it overnight.

74
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:17,186
When you're in early access, even though the ostensible point of early access is to bring players into a development process where the game is going to be evolving and changing potentially drastically over time,

75
00:04:17,906 --> 00:04:24,008
the reality is that you're just in a live support mode for a live game, and you kind of have to treat it that way.

76
00:04:24,528 --> 00:04:29,930
And it's still, you know, being on Xbox, it meant that we had to go through.

77
00:04:31,378 --> 00:04:34,819
It was very, very similar to just being a fully released game.

78
00:04:35,699 --> 00:04:39,640
We still had the requirement to go through certain patient stages to get updates out.

79
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:46,661
We had to have all of our ducks in a row in terms of publishing, in terms of store presence.

80
00:04:47,982 --> 00:04:49,902
And then you have a community to manage.

81
00:04:50,162 --> 00:04:54,583
And even though you're in early access, people develop their favorite features.

82
00:04:55,303 --> 00:04:59,724
It becomes very difficult to make certain changes without.

83
00:05:01,878 --> 00:05:03,018
Disappointing certain people.

84
00:05:03,699 --> 00:05:07,621
And so it's, and then the speed with which you can,

85
00:05:07,941 --> 00:05:10,402
the speed at which you can work is definitely slowed down

86
00:05:10,462 --> 00:05:13,503
because each and every update has to, you know,

87
00:05:14,644 --> 00:05:16,365
keep the game going, you know, you can't break the game

88
00:05:17,045 --> 00:05:18,586
to the greatest extent possible.

89
00:05:18,606 --> 00:05:19,826
And we had, throughout early access,

90
00:05:19,846 --> 00:05:21,787
we had kind of a caveat saying like,

91
00:05:22,708 --> 00:05:25,189
each update has the potential to disrupt your save game.

92
00:05:25,729 --> 00:05:26,990
We're not guaranteeing that everything

93
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:28,631
is always fully backwards compatible.

94
00:05:28,651 --> 00:05:30,412
We had a few updates that were.

95
00:05:31,156 --> 00:05:35,438
that were pretty big changes, like when we completely changed the base building paradigm at one point.

96
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:41,420
So I, you know, we had to write some code that would actually kind of give you some credit for the old base that you had.

97
00:05:43,341 --> 00:05:47,402
And so it's, and that takes, that's certainly a big toll on development.

98
00:05:47,422 --> 00:05:59,127
I estimate that it took us probably twice as long to make this game that we're playing today as it would have if we were not in early access and we were not trying to sustain the game through.

99
00:05:59,799 --> 00:06:02,821
monthly or every six weeks and have an update.

100
00:06:03,982 --> 00:06:06,464
Was that something you were sort of aware of as you were doing it,

101
00:06:06,484 --> 00:06:08,225
or is that something you've come to realize in hindsight?

102
00:06:09,546 --> 00:06:14,490
A little bit of both. I think we knew that there would be a toll and it would be a lot

103
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:20,454
of extra work going in, but I don't think we realized quite how much. Yeah.

104
00:06:20,874 --> 00:06:24,717
So what was the value to you as a team when you were working through this process?

105
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,699
Why did you decide to stick with this sort of open development philosophy,

106
00:06:27,719 --> 00:06:28,880
even though it was taking you more time?

107
00:06:32,808 --> 00:06:41,390
The original impetus was really, it was the only option or best option we had to maintain

108
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,411
control over development without bringing in a publisher or something like that.

109
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:51,613
And we have a really great community, a very supportive community.

110
00:06:51,973 --> 00:06:57,615
And so it's been, from that perspective, it's been very nice to learn how to work with our

111
00:06:57,635 --> 00:06:59,795
community and learn how to take their feedback.

112
00:07:00,757 --> 00:07:05,538
And it's also given us the opportunity to learn.

113
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,618
You know, like it should be said that when I,

114
00:07:07,738 --> 00:07:10,599
when we started, I think when we launched into early access,

115
00:07:11,619 --> 00:07:14,100
it was like System Error was not a company

116
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:16,380
in the traditional sense of a game company

117
00:07:16,460 --> 00:07:17,440
in the sense that we didn't have,

118
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:19,501
we didn't have like an office, we didn't have anything.

119
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:21,921
We didn't have a QA team.

120
00:07:21,981 --> 00:07:23,662
We didn't have, you know, like a support line.

121
00:07:23,982 --> 00:07:26,863
It was, it was just, it was practically a bunch of guys,

122
00:07:27,343 --> 00:07:30,063
you know, like in a, in a, in a garage band setup.

123
00:07:31,439 --> 00:07:37,462
And so it's given us the time and by working through early access

124
00:07:37,522 --> 00:07:40,824
and putting out a lot of updates, it's given us...

125
00:07:42,465 --> 00:07:45,827
The process of early access for us on Astroneer has been as much

126
00:07:46,387 --> 00:07:50,610
to build system era and learn how to be system era as it has to build the game.

127
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,912
Right on. Yeah, I mean, it was ages ago, but I remember we did an interview with you guys

128
00:07:55,053 --> 00:07:57,934
remotely and there were three or four dudes in a conference room and that was it.

129
00:07:58,114 --> 00:07:58,775
That was the whole team.

130
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:03,942
And if I remember right, most of the team came from sort of big budget productions,

131
00:08:03,962 --> 00:08:07,685
you know, they came from, I think, 343 and such, you know, AAA developers.

132
00:08:07,765 --> 00:08:08,325
All of us, yeah.

133
00:08:08,586 --> 00:08:08,866
Yeah.

134
00:08:09,666 --> 00:08:11,708
I wonder, like, now that you sort of have this shipped,

135
00:08:11,988 --> 00:08:14,250
I mean, and, you know, there's plenty of people in the chat

136
00:08:14,270 --> 00:08:17,713
who are echoing the fact that this is a well-loved and well-received game.

137
00:08:19,254 --> 00:08:22,496
How do you feel about your two experiences or those two ways of making games,

138
00:08:22,536 --> 00:08:26,439
which is sort of like closeted and sort of hidden away from the world for years

139
00:08:26,459 --> 00:08:29,281
versus sort of being open and upfront?

140
00:08:29,936 --> 00:08:32,077
Sort of just like by the seat of your pants.

141
00:08:32,777 --> 00:08:36,618
Do you think you want to go back to sort of a more closeted approach?

142
00:08:36,679 --> 00:08:41,280
Or is there just a lot of value in the early access open development philosophy?

143
00:08:43,481 --> 00:08:44,221
I don't know.

144
00:08:44,241 --> 00:08:49,243
We certainly don't want to be as closeted as most AAA developers are.

145
00:08:49,483 --> 00:08:51,564
You know, we were used to working on teams.

146
00:08:52,545 --> 00:08:55,866
So I came from myself and two of the other founders.

147
00:08:56,186 --> 00:08:56,926
We had met each other.

148
00:08:58,232 --> 00:09:01,274
through working on Halo at Microsoft, 3.3 Industries.

149
00:09:02,395 --> 00:09:06,117
Adam, the other co-founder, he worked at Ubisoft,

150
00:09:06,137 --> 00:09:10,920
and we had, and Riley, who's our fifth and our sound designer,

151
00:09:10,980 --> 00:09:13,101
he came from working at EA and Disney.

152
00:09:13,962 --> 00:09:15,123
So we all worked at huge companies

153
00:09:15,163 --> 00:09:16,604
with hundreds of people at these studios,

154
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:20,306
and at those studios, you, as an individual developer,

155
00:09:20,606 --> 00:09:22,807
have no interaction with the community at all.

156
00:09:24,729 --> 00:09:25,109
Yeah.

157
00:09:25,129 --> 00:09:27,430
And you are told that you are not allowed to say anything.

158
00:09:28,308 --> 00:09:31,871
And there are dire consequences if you go and start talking about the game,

159
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:34,133
or even once the game is released, just saying the wrong thing.

160
00:09:35,794 --> 00:09:38,156
And so from that perspective, we definitely don't want to go back to that.

161
00:09:38,476 --> 00:09:43,781
And I think the relationship, the kind of interaction that we've developed with our community

162
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:46,763
is something that we cherish and we want to hold on to that.

163
00:09:48,104 --> 00:09:50,046
As far as whether we'll do early access again,

164
00:09:50,226 --> 00:09:54,169
it's really just a decision about what is going to be...

165
00:09:55,657 --> 00:10:03,381
How are we going to be delivering the best products to that community most efficiently?

166
00:10:03,401 --> 00:10:10,504
I think Early Access has a bad reputation now.

167
00:10:10,544 --> 00:10:15,386
It was developing a bad reputation when we started.

168
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:20,308
For a lot of games that we started Early Access, we'd never finish, never come out of it.

169
00:10:20,348 --> 00:10:23,750
People would say, oh, we gave our money to these guys and the game's dead.

170
00:10:24,474 --> 00:10:25,715
We're never going to see anything for it.

171
00:10:27,615 --> 00:10:33,237
But yeah, I think it really depends.

172
00:10:33,277 --> 00:10:34,758
I think that if we do early access again,

173
00:10:35,178 --> 00:10:40,580
we'd like to shorten the cycle and try to present a game when

174
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,161
it enters early access that's closer to the finished product.

175
00:10:43,221 --> 00:10:44,902
Because I think Astroneer was so,

176
00:10:45,962 --> 00:10:49,064
it needed so much work when we started that.

177
00:10:49,224 --> 00:10:50,284
And there was so many other games

178
00:10:50,304 --> 00:10:52,585
that had gone through early access that were

179
00:10:52,605 --> 00:10:53,385
more representative of.

180
00:10:54,585 --> 00:10:57,908
People are maybe not used to having to go through

181
00:10:57,928 --> 00:10:59,749
as much iteration as we did.

182
00:11:01,190 --> 00:11:04,292
Yeah, I want to agree with you,

183
00:11:04,312 --> 00:11:07,654
but it feels like the public perception of early access

184
00:11:07,674 --> 00:11:09,835
might be changing and there might be sort of more recognition

185
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:11,837
that it can be a really valuable and useful pipeline

186
00:11:11,877 --> 00:11:12,937
for the right team.

187
00:11:12,977 --> 00:11:15,119
I think games like Astroneer go a long way

188
00:11:15,159 --> 00:11:16,960
towards proving that.

189
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,022
But unfortunately, I have let this chat lapse for too long.

190
00:11:21,063 --> 00:11:22,363
There's tons of great questions in here.

191
00:11:22,383 --> 00:11:23,304
Let me grab one for you.

192
00:11:24,919 --> 00:11:27,461
Ross play interactive wants to know how do you handle your workflow?

193
00:11:27,521 --> 00:11:29,783
Is it cloud based or over a network in-house?

194
00:11:31,164 --> 00:11:32,104
Oh, yeah, it's a combination.

195
00:11:32,645 --> 00:11:35,687
When we started, it was 100% cloud based because we

196
00:11:36,127 --> 00:11:39,350
just didn't have the time or the money to support

197
00:11:39,490 --> 00:11:41,111
any kind of in-house server architecture

198
00:11:41,131 --> 00:11:45,214
or infrastructure, I should say.

199
00:11:45,274 --> 00:11:45,935
Now we have.

200
00:11:46,675 --> 00:11:49,457
So when we started, it was we used Amazon

201
00:11:49,477 --> 00:11:50,938
EC2 for hosting our.

202
00:11:53,102 --> 00:11:58,926
We use Perforce for source control and we use Jira for task tracking,

203
00:11:58,946 --> 00:12:00,547
which we adopted a little later.

204
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:04,110
That was all in the Cloud.

205
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:09,153
And we use Slack, of course, sort of like everyone uses Slack nowadays.

206
00:12:09,574 --> 00:12:10,314
Sure.

207
00:12:11,415 --> 00:12:14,497
And that's all in the Cloud, and Slack itself is kind of a useful tool

208
00:12:14,517 --> 00:12:16,018
for just storing a huge amount of stuff.

209
00:12:18,654 --> 00:12:27,657
Now that once we started to, like once we moved into an office and we had a team, a larger team on site that needed a lot higher bandwidth,

210
00:12:27,817 --> 00:12:36,141
the bottleneck between the office and the cloud, especially for source control access when you're moving quite a large amount of data,

211
00:12:37,081 --> 00:12:43,123
moving that for an entire local office through one external internet connection is kind of a big bottleneck.

212
00:12:43,243 --> 00:12:46,345
So we moved the Perforce server in-house.

213
00:12:46,953 --> 00:12:52,197
All of our source control, we have in-house servers now for our actual game content.

214
00:12:52,977 --> 00:12:58,982
But things like our production software in Slack and file sharing, all that stuff is

215
00:12:59,002 --> 00:13:05,767
still in the cloud, which enables people to work remotely a lot more easily.

216
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:10,290
So I mean, I think working through the cloud is totally the best.

217
00:13:11,251 --> 00:13:11,951
easiest thing to do.

218
00:13:12,532 --> 00:13:14,634
And you should just keep doing it as long as you can.

219
00:13:14,654 --> 00:13:15,735
And for us,

220
00:13:15,755 --> 00:13:17,898
it just ultimately became just a technical limitation where

221
00:13:17,938 --> 00:13:23,884
it's still, you know, you really like if you need ten people

222
00:13:24,745 --> 00:13:26,687
all transferring data over a gigabit connection,

223
00:13:27,268 --> 00:13:29,750
you know, your Internet connection is not going to just hold up.

224
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,954
Yeah, I got to ask Bryant, why are you terraforming

225
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:33,755
this beautiful planet?

226
00:13:35,594 --> 00:13:45,223
I, uh, because it's there, to quote the mountain climber guy, I'm on a mission to build a car,

227
00:13:45,383 --> 00:13:48,446
and to build a car I need more bytes, to build more bytes I need to harvest bytes, which

228
00:13:48,486 --> 00:13:53,070
means finding the little doodads out in the forest and taking these big chunks right here

229
00:13:53,171 --> 00:13:55,132
and harvesting them at my base.

230
00:13:56,354 --> 00:13:56,794
So I...

231
00:13:58,595 --> 00:14:02,457
I was on a quest to do that and then it turned into a quest of survival when I fell down that hole.

232
00:14:02,697 --> 00:14:10,001
So, I'm making my way back home now, walking fast, face is flash, and I'm homebound.

233
00:14:11,782 --> 00:14:17,504
Yeah, anyway, so I have been struck by, as I play this game, as I'm sure many people have been chatting, kind of this...

234
00:14:21,287 --> 00:14:27,055
The way that this art style responds elegantly to the shaper tool that you have as a player,

235
00:14:28,056 --> 00:14:31,501
I'm curious, Brendan, if we're able to walk through sort of the...

236
00:14:33,150 --> 00:14:37,313
Kind of the, the, what makes the code tick on this, on this sort of thing,

237
00:14:37,353 --> 00:14:39,694
because I imagine, you know, your art team is sitting here trying to create

238
00:14:39,734 --> 00:14:42,956
like this beautiful stuff that can work in the procedural aspect.

239
00:14:43,016 --> 00:14:46,197
And it was your job when you were working on the code for the

240
00:14:46,237 --> 00:14:47,138
team to make sure it worked.

241
00:14:47,638 --> 00:14:49,659
So if you're able to give any insight on that, I think our

242
00:14:49,719 --> 00:14:50,720
audience might appreciate it.

243
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:52,661
Yeah.

244
00:14:52,681 --> 00:14:56,763
So you're, you're talking about, there's sort of two things, uh, that

245
00:14:56,783 --> 00:15:00,025
you touched on there, one is the, how do the artists actually generate the

246
00:15:00,325 --> 00:15:02,086
planets and how do they put their artistic.

247
00:15:02,479 --> 00:15:08,643
touch into this procedural generation system and then also how you mentioned that the smooth

248
00:15:08,683 --> 00:15:09,944
response to deformation.

249
00:15:12,726 --> 00:15:17,009
So, yes, and I was heavily involved in the code for that.

250
00:15:17,069 --> 00:15:20,651
So it was Jacob and I who were the first engineers in the project.

251
00:15:20,971 --> 00:15:23,133
Projects we worked on.

252
00:15:23,273 --> 00:15:25,954
There was sort of the terrain systems gone through two major iterations.

253
00:15:27,235 --> 00:15:29,117
The system that we shipped early access with.

254
00:15:29,432 --> 00:15:33,916
back in 2016 looked quite a bit different than the system that we have now.

255
00:15:34,016 --> 00:15:38,760
The system that we have now is way more powerful in terms of the artists getting the look that

256
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:42,843
they want and allowing us to create all the environments that we have now.

257
00:15:43,564 --> 00:15:47,768
So the early access game originally was, you know, we could kind of create a surface of a planet

258
00:15:49,409 --> 00:15:52,732
and we could create a layer of caves underneath the surface, but

259
00:15:52,992 --> 00:15:56,355
we couldn't do much more than that, not easily. And it was also very...

260
00:15:59,125 --> 00:16:02,146
It was hard to update without just totally breaking people's save games.

261
00:16:02,867 --> 00:16:08,109
So the new system has, you know, the planet is populated with stuff all the way down to the core,

262
00:16:08,589 --> 00:16:13,111
and we can create really exotic kind of shapes and biomes.

263
00:16:14,152 --> 00:16:19,554
And it's also much easier to update, so we can add and change the algorithms

264
00:16:19,574 --> 00:16:24,357
that define the planet landscape without actually breaking people's save games.

265
00:16:26,635 --> 00:16:29,958
So the system underneath is all, but both systems share some characteristics.

266
00:16:30,899 --> 00:16:32,260
It's essentially, it's a voxel system.

267
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:34,262
So it's, you know, you can think of something like Minecraft.

268
00:16:34,943 --> 00:16:38,086
The entire world is made up of a grid of 3D voxels.

269
00:16:40,168 --> 00:16:44,832
And then those voxels, those voxels, each voxel stores certain data.

270
00:16:45,313 --> 00:16:48,536
So in our case, it'll be, you know, density data that defines whether

271
00:16:48,556 --> 00:16:50,377
there's ground there or it's open air.

272
00:16:51,358 --> 00:16:51,839
And then that's.

273
00:16:52,691 --> 00:16:57,735
So there's a system that there's an algorithm that produces the voxel data and that's kind of like your

274
00:16:59,536 --> 00:17:01,778
like I said there was two different approaches we took to this

275
00:17:02,819 --> 00:17:07,623
but we defined the voxel data and then and then that voxel data so like in Minecraft you know

276
00:17:07,703 --> 00:17:11,806
once you have your voxels you pretty much have everything you just render a block where there's

277
00:17:11,826 --> 00:17:18,572
a voxel and the block has typically in a game like Minecraft would have an index to determine

278
00:17:19,392 --> 00:17:21,154
like an integer index that determines what

279
00:17:21,610 --> 00:17:22,530
type of block that is.

280
00:17:24,331 --> 00:17:28,251
In our game, it's a little bit, because we don't have blocks,

281
00:17:28,271 --> 00:17:29,472
we have kind of a smooth surface.

282
00:17:29,712 --> 00:17:31,432
It's a little bit more complicated.

283
00:17:31,472 --> 00:17:32,352
The data is a little heavier.

284
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:35,553
So each voxel stores a, the basic algorithm

285
00:17:35,593 --> 00:17:37,173
is that each voxel stores a density value.

286
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:41,774
And that density value can, you know, it has a range.

287
00:17:42,354 --> 00:17:45,094
And it can be positive or it can be negative.

288
00:17:45,134 --> 00:17:47,195
And if it's negative, it means that there's open air

289
00:17:48,095 --> 00:17:48,635
in that space.

290
00:17:48,695 --> 00:17:49,915
And if it's positive, it means there's

291
00:17:49,935 --> 00:17:50,995
more ground in that space.

292
00:17:51,859 --> 00:17:57,221
And where that crossover happens between positive and negative is where the surface is going to be.

293
00:17:58,221 --> 00:18:03,503
And then we run that vossel data through a polygonizing algorithm.

294
00:18:03,583 --> 00:18:05,924
We use one called marching cubes. It's very, very common.

295
00:18:06,544 --> 00:18:08,825
It's one of the most common ways to do this kind of polygonization.

296
00:18:09,285 --> 00:18:13,667
And that produces the actual geometry surface that you see.

297
00:18:13,747 --> 00:18:15,768
And we'll generate collision for that and so forth.

298
00:18:17,976 --> 00:18:20,878
And then so when you're deforming, you're just modifying the voxel data.

299
00:18:21,078 --> 00:18:25,461
You know, it's not like we don't really have to look at the actual mesh data.

300
00:18:25,941 --> 00:18:29,363
We just have to look at the voxel data, apply some transforms to it,

301
00:18:30,284 --> 00:18:32,385
so subtracting or adding from that density,

302
00:18:33,126 --> 00:18:35,287
and then rerun the polygonization for the chunk.

303
00:18:35,347 --> 00:18:38,950
So the ground is divided into chunks at a certain granularity

304
00:18:38,970 --> 00:18:41,791
so that we don't have to rebuild the mesh for the whole planet every time.

305
00:18:42,172 --> 00:18:44,433
We just rebuild the small area that you're standing on.

306
00:18:44,453 --> 00:18:46,855
And that's basically how it works.

307
00:18:48,245 --> 00:19:15,315
Yeah, I'm curious. I mean, in the years of development, like, you know, there have definitely been stories about this game's unique art style and the way you guys sort of blend procedural content with sort of like a hand authored touch. I remember reading a lot about the the biomes that you set up and tweak so that then you're sort of assured that they will generate an interesting landscape. I'm just curious. You've put so much effort into making this very attractive art style that has

308
00:19:16,768 --> 00:19:19,390
I think no texture's right and it's all voxel based

309
00:19:19,430 --> 00:19:21,371
and it's very, it seems very approachable

310
00:19:21,391 --> 00:19:23,553
but also very malleable to your needs as a studio.

311
00:19:24,353 --> 00:19:26,614
Were there any like major drawbacks

312
00:19:26,634 --> 00:19:28,015
that sort of cropped up during development

313
00:19:28,035 --> 00:19:29,096
that sort of made you sort of wish,

314
00:19:29,716 --> 00:19:30,837
oh, we wish we'd used textures

315
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,218
or we wish we hadn't used voxels

316
00:19:32,298 --> 00:19:34,859
or we wish this was like a hardcore space game

317
00:19:34,899 --> 00:19:38,221
instead of this incredibly adorable colorful wonderland?

318
00:19:38,241 --> 00:19:42,244
We like to joke that we decided to make

319
00:19:42,304 --> 00:19:45,566
the hardest possible game on all dimensions.

320
00:19:46,026 --> 00:19:46,166
Yeah.

321
00:19:47,327 --> 00:20:00,511
Because, you know, sort of like the wisdom, you know, if you've been at GDC and you talk to a lot of developers, especially indie developers, a lot of the advice is like, pick kind of one thing that you do that's different and focus on that and everything else, just do the easy way.

322
00:20:01,852 --> 00:20:07,454
And we were like, man, we, like in hindsight, we were like, we picked the hard way on everything.

323
00:20:08,854 --> 00:20:12,075
So this has been a very challenging game. In a lot of ways, it's been challenging because

324
00:20:14,184 --> 00:20:15,785
I mean, it's procedurally generated,

325
00:20:15,845 --> 00:20:18,147
and the challenge there is always how do you give players

326
00:20:19,248 --> 00:20:23,111
both, like, a different experience each time they play,

327
00:20:23,151 --> 00:20:25,433
but also one that's not completely uniform

328
00:20:25,453 --> 00:20:28,375
to the point where it's just totally boring and drab.

329
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,597
And once you've seen one area, you've seen them all.

330
00:20:30,938 --> 00:20:31,958
Totally.

331
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:36,262
It's because it's so procedural and because it's...

332
00:20:36,642 --> 00:20:38,464
and because you can deform all the terrain,

333
00:20:38,924 --> 00:20:41,386
and a lot of the techniques that AAA games use

334
00:20:41,426 --> 00:20:43,148
to make everything run super fast.

335
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:48,102
which involve, those techniques typically involve a lot of offline processing

336
00:20:48,262 --> 00:20:51,124
where you are, if you know what your map is going to look like

337
00:20:51,284 --> 00:20:56,806
and the layout of your level and all the textures and meshes that are going to go into it,

338
00:20:57,146 --> 00:20:59,067
you can do a ton of offline work

339
00:21:00,568 --> 00:21:04,049
so that the game isn't relieved of a lot of computations at run time.

340
00:21:05,410 --> 00:21:07,591
You can do, you know, light map baking and stuff like that.

341
00:21:08,111 --> 00:21:12,953
You can do offline visibility analysis, which means...

342
00:21:13,375 --> 00:21:15,616
from every point in the level, you'll know what the things are visible

343
00:21:15,696 --> 00:21:17,477
and so you can kind of really efficiently render.

344
00:21:18,397 --> 00:21:20,378
We can't do any of that in a procedural game.

345
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:24,360
So it makes it really hard to sometimes to optimize

346
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:25,480
to the extent that we would like to.

347
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:29,362
Yeah. And then, of course, there's other things like, you know, we've got

348
00:21:30,463 --> 00:21:31,723
these huge environments that are.

349
00:21:32,924 --> 00:21:34,925
You know, you're traveling between planets.

350
00:21:35,985 --> 00:21:38,827
The planets are spherical, so you can't even rely on gravity.

351
00:21:39,147 --> 00:21:42,008
Gravity doesn't even happen in one direction, which is surprisingly

352
00:21:43,641 --> 00:21:45,222
You'd think that that's relatively straightforward,

353
00:21:45,262 --> 00:21:49,164
but it's one of those annoying things

354
00:21:49,204 --> 00:21:54,468
where the fact that gravity is typically negative one on the Y

355
00:21:54,588 --> 00:21:56,829
or Z axis is hard-coded everywhere.

356
00:21:56,949 --> 00:22:00,211
So that becomes a big pain.

357
00:22:02,273 --> 00:22:03,814
And we did this all in multiplayer.

358
00:22:04,214 --> 00:22:07,356
Right. Fully co-op. What could go wrong?

359
00:22:08,997 --> 00:22:11,679
Yeah, it sounds like a lot more work than I expected.

360
00:22:12,713 --> 00:22:15,515
I have so much more to ask, but there are tons of good questions coming on.

361
00:22:15,535 --> 00:22:16,615
I want to get some of them in.

362
00:22:17,436 --> 00:22:18,236
Please keep them coming.

363
00:22:19,036 --> 00:22:22,438
There's one here from Chunky Spaceman who wants to know how does System Error deal with

364
00:22:22,498 --> 00:22:23,459
programming burnout?

365
00:22:23,479 --> 00:22:25,099
Do people rotate what they work on?

366
00:22:25,139 --> 00:22:26,540
Do you allow people to work remotely?

367
00:22:26,980 --> 00:22:28,381
Or how do you deal with that kind of stress?

368
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:30,162
Burnout?

369
00:22:31,422 --> 00:22:35,684
I don't think I've ever experienced programming burnout personally, so I'm curious what that

370
00:22:36,064 --> 00:22:36,825
looks like exactly.

371
00:22:36,845 --> 00:22:37,485
Nice.

372
00:22:37,845 --> 00:22:40,947
I think in our case, most of the...

373
00:22:42,134 --> 00:22:44,855
like six, seven engineers now on the team.

374
00:22:45,255 --> 00:22:47,935
And because of what I just talked about,

375
00:22:47,955 --> 00:22:49,576
because the game is this pretty,

376
00:22:49,656 --> 00:22:51,156
for a small team it's a pretty big game,

377
00:22:51,176 --> 00:22:52,896
it's a pretty technically complicated game.

378
00:22:53,537 --> 00:22:54,657
There's so much to work on.

379
00:22:55,557 --> 00:23:00,138
And everybody, like there's more areas of,

380
00:23:01,158 --> 00:23:02,999
like there's more potential areas of expertise

381
00:23:03,019 --> 00:23:04,639
that we could apply that we have people on the team.

382
00:23:04,679 --> 00:23:06,299
So you get to kind of rotate around a lot.

383
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:08,240
And there's always things,

384
00:23:08,260 --> 00:23:10,480
you know, if you're a person that works on,

385
00:23:10,963 --> 00:23:14,385
rendering optimization is getting an opportunity to work on gameplay, vice versa.

386
00:23:16,265 --> 00:23:20,547
So I try to make sure, and it's kind of one of my jobs in the team, is to try to make sure people

387
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:26,610
are satisfied with what they're doing. And so I'm constantly checking in. And so if, you know,

388
00:23:26,730 --> 00:23:31,733
somebody, we try to make sure that people are working on what they really want to work on.

389
00:23:33,534 --> 00:23:37,276
For example, I have one guy on the team who really wanted to work on eBuy, for which I was like,

390
00:23:37,376 --> 00:23:38,036
that's amazing.

391
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,092
I want to keep you forever.

392
00:23:40,112 --> 00:23:42,774
It's really hard to find programmers

393
00:23:42,794 --> 00:23:43,815
who want to work on UI code.

394
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:44,976
Yeah, sounds like a gem.

395
00:23:44,996 --> 00:23:48,358
But yeah, that's pretty much it.

396
00:23:48,378 --> 00:23:50,580
There's just a lot to chew on as an engineer.

397
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,201
Yeah, I can see that.

398
00:23:53,042 --> 00:23:54,203
There's a question here from James5zh,

399
00:23:54,463 --> 00:23:58,106
and it's just like when you're going to add a bunch of story,

400
00:23:58,266 --> 00:24:01,128
which is sort of an interesting question,

401
00:24:01,148 --> 00:24:02,970
but it's sort of what I want to ask, which is that ...

402
00:24:04,433 --> 00:24:06,255
You know, when I look at the success of Astroneer,

403
00:24:06,875 --> 00:24:09,216
and I look at sort of what are similar games in the industry,

404
00:24:09,497 --> 00:24:11,638
like it's hard not to look at something like No Man's Sky

405
00:24:12,058 --> 00:24:14,299
and to watch the journey that that team went on

406
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:15,120
and that game went on.

407
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,802
You know, that game seems to be in a really good place,

408
00:24:19,002 --> 00:24:20,983
and it seems to have a really robust story

409
00:24:21,244 --> 00:24:22,484
and a bunch of other stuff going on there.

410
00:24:22,784 --> 00:24:25,946
And I'm so impressed that Astroneer has stayed from the start

411
00:24:25,986 --> 00:24:28,528
like a purely co-op sandbox experience.

412
00:24:29,469 --> 00:24:31,390
I'm curious, like, over the years,

413
00:24:31,430 --> 00:24:32,290
like how has the team...

414
00:24:33,186 --> 00:24:37,748
I thought about the idea of trying to add in a story like what is any potential value to you?

415
00:24:37,768 --> 00:24:41,610
And what are the what is the hassle like how have you gone about thinking about that aspect?

416
00:24:41,910 --> 00:24:45,032
And to quickly, quickly just add a kind of a dev clarification

417
00:24:45,072 --> 00:24:49,254
I guess when we ask about story we should also be asking about what is essentially authored content

418
00:24:49,614 --> 00:24:54,197
because you could you could you could totally skip over you could totally maintain the idea of a

419
00:24:55,357 --> 00:24:59,719
emergent narrative or whatever and still have authored encounters in the game that are more scripted

420
00:25:01,487 --> 00:25:04,369
That's probably a more broad, better answer, because I will...

421
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:07,851
I could go off on a narrative tangent forever,

422
00:25:07,931 --> 00:25:11,294
so I just wanted to rein this in into something that's very...

423
00:25:12,254 --> 00:25:13,575
that I think a lot of devs can relate to,

424
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:16,277
the question of authored versus emergent.

425
00:25:18,238 --> 00:25:20,840
Yeah. So, Brandon, what about authored content?

426
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:23,482
What's the deal? What's the risks? What are you thinking about?

427
00:25:23,502 --> 00:25:28,105
I mean, that's something that we talk about quite a bit,

428
00:25:28,505 --> 00:25:29,486
and I think...

429
00:25:29,979 --> 00:25:36,381
When we started the very beginning of the project with just four people, it was the decision to go

430
00:25:38,702 --> 00:25:44,864
much more procedural was partially because we wanted to create a game that you could put a lot

431
00:25:44,884 --> 00:25:51,106
of hours into but would be tractable for us to actually achieve. So if you want to make a 100

432
00:25:51,146 --> 00:25:57,287
hour game and that's entirely author content, it's that's impossible for a four person team to do.

433
00:25:59,470 --> 00:26:03,513
But you can do it for a game that is more procedural.

434
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:06,115
And it doesn't necessarily mean that it has to be a sandbox game.

435
00:26:06,195 --> 00:26:10,518
So if you look at a game like FTL, which is made by two guys,

436
00:26:11,498 --> 00:26:16,061
that's a procedural game that feels like it's narrative.

437
00:26:17,863 --> 00:26:20,945
And so, you know, you're wanting to replay it

438
00:26:21,745 --> 00:26:23,006
to get a different experience each time.

439
00:26:24,627 --> 00:26:27,429
And you're kind of making up that narrative in your head.

440
00:26:27,449 --> 00:26:28,170
And that was sort of.

441
00:26:28,678 --> 00:26:30,759
where we were going with Astroneer in the beginning.

442
00:26:33,121 --> 00:26:37,545
Something that I definitely think that we didn't achieve

443
00:26:37,585 --> 00:26:39,967
on Astroneer so far that I would have liked to

444
00:26:40,287 --> 00:26:47,312
was kind of more of what Brian talked about,

445
00:26:47,352 --> 00:26:50,535
which was injecting some more of those authored,

446
00:26:51,115 --> 00:26:52,396
slightly more scripted experiences

447
00:26:52,857 --> 00:26:54,178
within the procedural framework.

448
00:26:54,778 --> 00:26:55,899
So things that you could encounter

449
00:26:56,399 --> 00:26:58,261
that create a little mini quest for you.

450
00:26:58,953 --> 00:27:02,615
It's something that we're still very much interested in exploring.

451
00:27:03,275 --> 00:27:07,076
But they do put a lot more pressure on creating that content.

452
00:27:07,316 --> 00:27:08,457
It's going to be expensive to make,

453
00:27:08,497 --> 00:27:09,857
and people will burn through them quite quickly.

454
00:27:09,897 --> 00:27:13,839
And so you're kind of always having to create more and more of them.

455
00:27:14,339 --> 00:27:14,639
Sure.

456
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:17,620
But I think that's certainly a direction that the game could take.

457
00:27:18,600 --> 00:27:21,901
Nice. There's a lot of questions here in chat

458
00:27:21,941 --> 00:27:23,202
about something called the Big Purple,

459
00:27:23,502 --> 00:27:25,382
but I think maybe we shouldn't talk about that.

460
00:27:25,422 --> 00:27:26,163
I don't know what that is.

461
00:27:26,183 --> 00:27:28,123
Brian, do you know what the Big Purple is?

462
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:30,860
No.

463
00:27:31,460 --> 00:27:31,820
Okay.

464
00:27:32,180 --> 00:27:34,401
I apologize for any visual lag.

465
00:27:34,461 --> 00:27:35,701
Folks are saying it should.

466
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:39,402
We've got an Xbox hooked up to a capture card here.

467
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:43,023
So unfortunately, we're a little limited on the tech side.

468
00:27:43,723 --> 00:27:44,403
That should be us.

469
00:27:44,503 --> 00:27:46,624
I don't want to throw the poor.

470
00:27:46,644 --> 00:27:48,144
Also, I guess it's my tethers.

471
00:27:48,644 --> 00:27:51,165
They're saying my tethers are contributing to the...

472
00:27:51,185 --> 00:27:55,526
So I'm just generally trying to stay out of like the forest and any high particle areas.

473
00:27:56,526 --> 00:27:57,186
Sorry, guys.

474
00:27:57,626 --> 00:27:58,586
You just seem well tethered.

475
00:27:58,866 --> 00:27:59,046
That's...

476
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:01,868
So when people talk about the big purple,

477
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,550
they're talking about there are these large structures

478
00:28:04,570 --> 00:28:06,611
that you can find on the surface that kind of relate to the,

479
00:28:07,112 --> 00:28:09,313
there is a central quest in the game.

480
00:28:09,333 --> 00:28:11,375
So you can kind of, you can beat the game.

481
00:28:12,515 --> 00:28:13,816
And those things relate to that.

482
00:28:14,917 --> 00:28:16,398
Well, I'm sorry if we spoiled that for anybody,

483
00:28:16,418 --> 00:28:17,319
but it sounds incredible.

484
00:28:18,540 --> 00:28:22,863
I may talk to you about just like the general design and UI.

485
00:28:22,923 --> 00:28:25,064
And we touched on this a lot, but it's sort of

486
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,745
the big striking point of this game.

487
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:28,647
I keep watching Brian to zoom into his backpack.

488
00:28:29,165 --> 00:28:31,247
and I love it. I just, I want to watch you do that all day.

489
00:28:31,267 --> 00:28:32,648
It's so smart.

490
00:28:32,889 --> 00:28:34,550
It's, and that's been there, I think, since the beginning.

491
00:28:34,570 --> 00:28:36,051
Right, Brendan? Like that was one of the big deals.

492
00:28:36,151 --> 00:28:37,292
I remember when this game first,

493
00:28:37,813 --> 00:28:38,974
like started getting some buzz,

494
00:28:39,034 --> 00:28:41,196
it was all about like the gifts of these,

495
00:28:41,236 --> 00:28:42,817
like beautiful sculpted terrains

496
00:28:42,857 --> 00:28:46,781
and these very intuitive, like UI elements.

497
00:28:48,382 --> 00:28:49,403
Has that ever been a hassle?

498
00:28:49,723 --> 00:28:51,325
Like, have you ever really regretted?

499
00:28:51,670 --> 00:28:59,076
Are you guys committed to making everything so, uh, intuitive and like, not, uh, not traditionally menu driven the way most games are?

500
00:28:59,937 --> 00:29:00,837
Um, it's-

501
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:05,381
So yeah, I mean, it has been part of the game since early access, since the start of it.

502
00:29:05,821 --> 00:29:07,763
Um, and it certainly has been a hassle.

503
00:29:08,083 --> 00:29:10,865
Um, but it's been a good kind of hassle.

504
00:29:10,905 --> 00:29:12,707
I mean, it is something that we cherish about the game.

505
00:29:12,747 --> 00:29:14,288
We don't- certainly don't regret it.

506
00:29:14,428 --> 00:29:15,429
It's very important to the game.

507
00:29:17,410 --> 00:29:19,552
But it does mean that, uh-

508
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,982
What would be a pretty straightforward addition

509
00:29:22,102 --> 00:29:25,325
or decision in another game, just to add a UI element,

510
00:29:25,365 --> 00:29:26,666
just to add an extra item in the menu,

511
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,549
is a much more difficult process in our game,

512
00:29:30,769 --> 00:29:32,831
or something like the backpack, which is kind of why we,

513
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,453
like, you know, we used to talk about,

514
00:29:35,493 --> 00:29:38,216
hey, like literally, like just hold it to diegetic rule,

515
00:29:38,956 --> 00:29:42,059
diegetic meaning, meaning, we don't know what that means.

516
00:29:42,099 --> 00:29:42,859
In world, yeah.

517
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:43,400
Interfaces.

518
00:29:45,908 --> 00:29:47,769
We had discussed being very strict about that,

519
00:29:47,789 --> 00:29:52,031
so that even your settings menu would be in-world.

520
00:29:52,051 --> 00:29:54,192
But just the idea of having to actually refactor

521
00:29:55,012 --> 00:29:57,653
the in-game art for literally every UI change,

522
00:29:57,713 --> 00:30:00,094
or that was quite difficult.

523
00:30:00,134 --> 00:30:02,155
And it also means that for wherever

524
00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,836
you have text being displayed, we're

525
00:30:05,856 --> 00:30:07,997
localized into 14, 15 different languages,

526
00:30:08,217 --> 00:30:13,259
so that you really can't bake the text, for example,

527
00:30:13,299 --> 00:30:13,799
into a mesh.

528
00:30:14,603 --> 00:30:17,105
without having to actually have different meshes per language.

529
00:30:17,145 --> 00:30:20,446
So it's like, that becomes almost a very,

530
00:30:20,566 --> 00:30:22,187
between very difficult to even tractable.

531
00:30:22,867 --> 00:30:27,089
So we now, the game now has kind of a mix of traditional UI

532
00:30:27,149 --> 00:30:28,910
for things like the menu front end

533
00:30:29,530 --> 00:30:33,092
and some things like those tool tips that you see.

534
00:30:33,712 --> 00:30:35,433
But a lot of the, yeah, a lot of the,

535
00:30:35,793 --> 00:30:38,074
just the way that you engage with the world,

536
00:30:38,194 --> 00:30:39,815
if you're actually interacting with items in the world,

537
00:30:40,235 --> 00:30:41,655
that's all still diegetic.

538
00:30:42,296 --> 00:30:43,016
And we really, really,

539
00:30:43,612 --> 00:30:44,752
That's something about our game that we love.

540
00:30:45,193 --> 00:30:47,294
I think it's something about the game that makes it unique.

541
00:30:47,994 --> 00:30:50,596
And it kind of creates for us, it was important

542
00:30:50,696 --> 00:30:54,118
because it creates a sense,

543
00:30:54,419 --> 00:30:57,841
it heightens the sense of intimacy in your world

544
00:30:57,901 --> 00:30:58,581
and connection with it.

545
00:30:59,562 --> 00:31:03,845
We thought that it went along perfectly well

546
00:31:03,905 --> 00:31:06,226
with the fact that you could deform all the terrain.

547
00:31:07,487 --> 00:31:09,709
It just felt right to us.

548
00:31:10,389 --> 00:31:13,411
Right on. I wonder, let's drill down into that for a second.

549
00:31:13,976 --> 00:31:17,699
If other devs wanted to try something similar and try to approach a game with a similar

550
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:24,343
kind of diegetic design, what specific advice would you give them that you learned during

551
00:31:24,363 --> 00:31:24,763
development?

552
00:31:24,783 --> 00:31:28,546
Like, were there specific things that were exceedingly difficult?

553
00:31:29,647 --> 00:31:31,328
Like, I mean, text was a great example.

554
00:31:31,368 --> 00:31:37,392
Or were there examples of places where it was initially very easier than you expected

555
00:31:37,452 --> 00:31:38,092
and more valuable?

556
00:31:38,192 --> 00:31:42,135
Or what advice would you give after two or three years of trying to figure out how to

557
00:31:42,155 --> 00:31:42,575
do this well?

558
00:31:44,285 --> 00:31:48,307
Um, yeah, no text is a big one in real life.

559
00:31:48,347 --> 00:31:51,869
So we really don't put any text in any diegetic locations.

560
00:31:52,149 --> 00:31:55,130
So even when you bring up your catalog

561
00:31:55,350 --> 00:31:57,051
to look at your research tree,

562
00:31:57,071 --> 00:31:58,772
that's kind of a traditional UI

563
00:31:59,672 --> 00:32:02,393
presented in a diegetic element.

564
00:32:03,094 --> 00:32:04,994
So we're not shy, we don't shy away

565
00:32:05,014 --> 00:32:06,955
from sort of building a traditional UI screen

566
00:32:06,975 --> 00:32:08,956
that we can then render onto a surface in the game.

567
00:32:09,556 --> 00:32:11,677
That's a totally, we don't really consider that a cop-out.

568
00:32:11,737 --> 00:32:12,358
We're just like, you know,

569
00:32:13,153 --> 00:32:15,835
Our rule is that if it's something that the Astroneer

570
00:32:15,915 --> 00:32:18,956
would themselves look at through some sort of digital

571
00:32:18,976 --> 00:32:20,717
interface, then that's cool.

572
00:32:20,737 --> 00:32:24,598
We can present it that way.

573
00:32:24,998 --> 00:32:30,901
One sort of technical thing is that scale becomes a really

574
00:32:30,941 --> 00:32:31,441
tricky issue.

575
00:32:33,802 --> 00:32:36,563
And so when you're interacting with things like with your

576
00:32:36,603 --> 00:32:41,285
mouse or your gamepad, you need things to be of a scale

577
00:32:41,545 --> 00:32:42,626
that's scalable.

578
00:32:43,022 --> 00:32:47,826
that makes interacting with them possible and lets you see those things acceptably.

579
00:32:48,226 --> 00:32:50,868
And so we play with scale a lot and people may notice this,

580
00:32:50,948 --> 00:32:59,014
that the resource nugget in the backpack right now is the size that is super tiny.

581
00:32:59,034 --> 00:33:02,217
It's not at all the scale that it would be in the world.

582
00:33:02,257 --> 00:33:04,378
So if you take that output in the world, it actually scales up.

583
00:33:04,418 --> 00:33:07,501
And we play with scale quite a bit and we don't care.

584
00:33:10,722 --> 00:33:19,547
It's just sort of things get scaled up and down as needed to make the interaction more pleasant or just possible.

585
00:33:20,888 --> 00:33:26,351
Yeah, that seems like a necessity. If you're going to start making planets, you've got to have a planet that has giant mushroom trees.

586
00:33:26,371 --> 00:33:31,654
You've got to have a giant flower planet. You've got to have just the weirdest scales you can possibly imagine.

587
00:33:32,973 --> 00:33:35,875
There is a super good question here from Shadow Echo if you got a second.

588
00:33:35,935 --> 00:33:40,438
They want to know, can you talk about the challenges of development for both console and PC?

589
00:33:40,878 --> 00:33:44,941
They know for instance that there were some issues with the UI that were difficult to see on a TV.

590
00:33:45,342 --> 00:33:49,765
So let's talk about like how did you guys handle trying to split this across multiple platforms

591
00:33:49,805 --> 00:33:54,068
and get it ready and what are the unique challenges of console versus PC players?

592
00:33:54,088 --> 00:33:57,851
Um they're very, I mean the...

593
00:33:58,805 --> 00:34:01,927
The main challenge was the interface differences.

594
00:34:01,947 --> 00:34:05,829
So making the game as equally playable as possible

595
00:34:06,529 --> 00:34:07,830
on both a mouse and keyboard interface,

596
00:34:08,590 --> 00:34:09,411
a gamepad interface,

597
00:34:11,372 --> 00:34:12,553
it certainly adds to the challenge,

598
00:34:13,533 --> 00:34:14,874
especially with the diegetic UI.

599
00:34:15,274 --> 00:34:18,396
And so for initially, I mean,

600
00:34:18,416 --> 00:34:20,077
the Xbox version initially was created

601
00:34:20,477 --> 00:34:21,358
after the PC version.

602
00:34:21,678 --> 00:34:25,180
And so the very first interface we had

603
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:27,282
was kind of like...

604
00:34:28,485 --> 00:34:33,207
The best we could do with the gamepad, I think I created the gamepad controls initially and

605
00:34:33,867 --> 00:34:37,549
you know, we made something that felt pretty good for movement and then a lot of the item

606
00:34:37,569 --> 00:34:42,251
interaction was like, well, you hold a button to bring up a cursor, you know, kind of like

607
00:34:42,291 --> 00:34:48,453
Destiny UI style. And then we've since continued to make improvements that make

608
00:34:48,813 --> 00:34:53,195
I think the game a lot smoother to play with better shortcuts for gamepad.

609
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,442
But it's always difficult.

610
00:34:57,402 --> 00:35:03,106
The control scheme, your ideal control scheme for a mouse and keyboard

611
00:35:03,126 --> 00:35:04,727
is always going to look very different than a gamepad.

612
00:35:04,767 --> 00:35:05,888
So that's always a challenge.

613
00:35:08,610 --> 00:35:13,953
And then the challenge, one challenge on PCs is that you just have,

614
00:35:14,954 --> 00:35:16,715
and this is an age-old thing,

615
00:35:16,895 --> 00:35:20,958
is that you just have a hugely,

616
00:35:21,138 --> 00:35:23,239
just a massive variety of hardware that you're...

617
00:35:23,757 --> 00:35:25,858
game needs to run on.

618
00:35:26,118 --> 00:35:28,039
When we launched Early Access at the very, very beginning,

619
00:35:28,059 --> 00:35:31,741
the first couple of days, we had some issues where people

620
00:35:31,781 --> 00:35:34,363
with certain old CPUs just couldn't even start the game

621
00:35:34,903 --> 00:35:37,124
because we had kind of inadvertently included certain

622
00:35:37,344 --> 00:35:39,105
instructions that were not compatible.

623
00:35:39,385 --> 00:35:41,066
They were compatible with, for example, the Xbox,

624
00:35:41,567 --> 00:35:44,388
but not compatible with older CPUs.

625
00:35:45,749 --> 00:35:47,870
So your level of QA

626
00:35:49,957 --> 00:35:54,161
you know, burden that you're undertaking to make sure that you're achieving,

627
00:35:54,401 --> 00:35:57,924
you know, an acceptable compatibility level is a lot higher when you're working

628
00:35:57,944 --> 00:36:03,949
with PCs. And then you just have this huge range of

629
00:36:04,009 --> 00:36:07,371
performance. Like your performance envelope is so huge. So, you know,

630
00:36:07,391 --> 00:36:12,175
it might run on my development PC, you know,

631
00:36:12,235 --> 00:36:16,439
our game thread update might be five milliseconds, you know, on my PC,

632
00:36:16,479 --> 00:36:16,699
which is.

633
00:36:17,258 --> 00:36:20,320
three years old, and put on the Xbox, it's 20 milliseconds.

634
00:36:20,340 --> 00:36:26,203
So it's just like, you really, like,

635
00:36:26,283 --> 00:36:28,224
ideally you kind of want to have a person dedicated

636
00:36:28,245 --> 00:36:30,326
to each platform you're working on.

637
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,188
Yeah, totally. Yeah.

638
00:36:34,248 --> 00:36:35,289
It's wild to still be talking about that.

639
00:36:35,309 --> 00:36:39,391
Like, I feel like that's been a thorn in game developer's sides

640
00:36:39,411 --> 00:36:42,353
for decades, just trying to make PC games work.

641
00:36:43,334 --> 00:36:46,195
But I don't know. You still do it. It's incredible.

642
00:36:47,544 --> 00:36:51,366
Talking about PCs and sort of all the different platforms,

643
00:36:51,786 --> 00:36:54,547
I got to ask, how are you feeling about the Epic Store?

644
00:36:54,567 --> 00:36:56,628
Are you going to launch over there?

645
00:36:56,648 --> 00:36:57,808
Are you going to go to Kongregate?

646
00:36:57,828 --> 00:37:00,790
There's a lot of opportunities now to get off of Steam

647
00:37:01,290 --> 00:37:03,731
when you're looking to sell to PC owners.

648
00:37:04,431 --> 00:37:05,712
How are you feeling about that stuff?

649
00:37:06,092 --> 00:37:07,493
Yeah, I'm pretty interested.

650
00:37:07,533 --> 00:37:12,915
I mean, I think when I talk about my GameDev friends

651
00:37:12,935 --> 00:37:14,616
about what's new in the industry,

652
00:37:14,736 --> 00:37:15,676
I'm pretty interested in how is...

653
00:37:17,457 --> 00:37:20,980
How is the way that people buy their games gonna change?

654
00:37:21,020 --> 00:37:22,862
I think that that's one area, especially on PC,

655
00:37:23,022 --> 00:37:25,484
that just kind of hasn't changed for many years.

656
00:37:26,885 --> 00:37:28,927
And it's pretty well known by now

657
00:37:28,967 --> 00:37:31,949
that Steam is outrageously profitable

658
00:37:33,290 --> 00:37:35,252
to the extent that there's definitely

659
00:37:35,272 --> 00:37:37,334
a competitive opening there for somebody to come in

660
00:37:37,354 --> 00:37:39,296
with a similar platform and just try to undercut them,

661
00:37:39,336 --> 00:37:44,580
which is exactly what Tim Sweeney and Epic are trying to do.

662
00:37:46,613 --> 00:37:49,855
Steam just has a, I think for, it's much easier.

663
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:52,356
And like you're already seeing this shift starting to happen

664
00:37:52,376 --> 00:37:53,297
with the AAA developers.

665
00:37:53,317 --> 00:37:56,179
So you're seeing a lot of big games not appearing on Steam.

666
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:56,779
Yeah.

667
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,062
And because it's, you know, for the big companies

668
00:38:01,082 --> 00:38:02,943
that have all of their own infrastructure,

669
00:38:02,963 --> 00:38:04,164
they can do that.

670
00:38:04,184 --> 00:38:08,046
They can just try to figure out how to distribute the game

671
00:38:08,086 --> 00:38:10,468
in the way that maximizes their own revenue.

672
00:38:11,468 --> 00:38:12,789
And they can do all their own marketing

673
00:38:13,269 --> 00:38:14,830
and they have all their own.

674
00:38:15,497 --> 00:38:16,857
multiplayer backend infrastructure.

675
00:38:17,378 --> 00:38:20,420
For a smaller developer like us, a lot of the value in Steam

676
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:22,061
is not just the distribution.

677
00:38:22,101 --> 00:38:26,003
It's also that it provides a platform through which people

678
00:38:26,023 --> 00:38:32,868
can connect multiplayer and all the other features

679
00:38:32,928 --> 00:38:33,628
and the storefronts.

680
00:38:34,629 --> 00:38:37,931
And it's built in marketing because you

681
00:38:37,951 --> 00:38:41,493
can work with Valve to try to get featured on the store.

682
00:38:43,172 --> 00:38:46,532
And so for us, it's as we build out our own capabilities,

683
00:38:47,253 --> 00:38:50,793
as we are working on our own server support,

684
00:38:51,213 --> 00:38:56,575
and we have a lot more sort of back-end service set up

685
00:38:56,775 --> 00:38:58,315
than we did when we launched.

686
00:38:58,375 --> 00:39:01,516
And so it's becoming more possible for us

687
00:39:01,536 --> 00:39:02,896
to exist on different platforms.

688
00:39:04,296 --> 00:39:06,837
The main reason that we've never been on a PC platform

689
00:39:06,877 --> 00:39:08,477
aside from Steam is we didn't want

690
00:39:08,497 --> 00:39:10,518
to split the player base in terms of multiplayer.

691
00:39:11,819 --> 00:39:14,921
Because right now you just connect via your Steam accounts.

692
00:39:15,121 --> 00:39:18,283
We don't have our own account system and our own servers.

693
00:39:20,225 --> 00:39:22,086
So that'll be...

694
00:39:22,306 --> 00:39:23,927
And so to us, that's always been the driving factor,

695
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,309
is that we don't want to split up the player base.

696
00:39:26,369 --> 00:39:28,650
So if we can explore, when we reach the capability

697
00:39:28,710 --> 00:39:31,572
to be able to run the game on different distribution platforms,

698
00:39:31,613 --> 00:39:33,614
but still have all those players be able to play together,

699
00:39:33,634 --> 00:39:36,496
that's something that we're going to take a lot more seriously.

700
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:37,477
Nice.

701
00:39:39,835 --> 00:39:42,076
I have a lot more questions about that, but I feel like it's time to look at chat.

702
00:39:42,156 --> 00:39:43,797
Brian, how are you doing in that cave?

703
00:39:44,137 --> 00:39:44,698
That looks rough.

704
00:39:45,318 --> 00:39:45,959
No, it's okay.

705
00:39:46,099 --> 00:39:51,082
I just forgot that, like, somewhere between the tutorial and me actually playing the game,

706
00:39:51,102 --> 00:39:52,843
I forgot how canisters work.

707
00:39:53,643 --> 00:40:01,788
And now I don't have any canisters with which to build a ramp, a canister full of dirt,

708
00:40:01,848 --> 00:40:05,531
and I just need to, like, figure out how to get my way out of here.

709
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:06,391
This is very silly.

710
00:40:06,411 --> 00:40:07,412
You're doing great.

711
00:40:08,495 --> 00:40:11,396
Can you always just dig a tunnel upwards?

712
00:40:11,736 --> 00:40:13,276
Yeah, that's what the effect goes.

713
00:40:16,017 --> 00:40:19,598
There is a good question here. We may have touched on it, but I want to make sure we get it just in case.

714
00:40:19,698 --> 00:40:23,979
Overboyin asks, are there any sacrifices you made to get the game working on controllers?

715
00:40:26,180 --> 00:40:27,120
Ooh, that's a literate question.

716
00:40:29,161 --> 00:40:29,361
Well.

717
00:40:31,989 --> 00:40:33,009
I don't think we made sacrifices.

718
00:40:33,049 --> 00:40:34,390
I mean, we've never...

719
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,731
Like, so if the question is implying,

720
00:40:36,951 --> 00:40:39,111
did you nerf the mouse and keyboard interface

721
00:40:39,131 --> 00:40:44,793
to make it work on controller, I think the answer is no.

722
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:45,113
Yeah.

723
00:40:45,153 --> 00:40:46,894
The game is still very much, I think,

724
00:40:47,454 --> 00:40:50,455
a mouse-friendly interface.

725
00:40:50,775 --> 00:40:53,716
And I think the controller players still have it,

726
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:56,437
have a more difficult time in certain kinds of interactions,

727
00:40:56,477 --> 00:40:57,937
which is something that we always want to improve.

728
00:40:59,658 --> 00:41:00,918
But no, the answer is, like, we've never...

729
00:41:02,481 --> 00:41:05,002
I can't remember a time when we've been like,

730
00:41:05,042 --> 00:41:07,683
we just can't, we totally can't do this

731
00:41:08,444 --> 00:41:09,144
because of GamePad.

732
00:41:09,184 --> 00:41:11,305
I think the only thing, the only consideration

733
00:41:11,325 --> 00:41:13,486
that we always keep in mind

734
00:41:14,446 --> 00:41:16,087
when thinking about controls and GamePad

735
00:41:16,667 --> 00:41:18,067
is the number of face buttons

736
00:41:18,107 --> 00:41:19,268
that are available on a GamePad.

737
00:41:20,148 --> 00:41:23,650
So we definitely don't fill the keyboard with shortcuts.

738
00:41:24,010 --> 00:41:25,690
So some games that are,

739
00:41:26,191 --> 00:41:28,552
a lot of games really,

740
00:41:28,592 --> 00:41:31,493
that are exclusively designed for mouse and keyboard.

741
00:41:32,209 --> 00:41:34,990
We'll just use all the buttons, just use every key on the keyboard.

742
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:36,091
Yeah, you got it. Why not?

743
00:41:36,111 --> 00:41:39,254
And we generally don't do that.

744
00:41:39,294 --> 00:41:39,974
That's a lot of...

745
00:41:40,955 --> 00:41:42,476
That's forward-thinking restraint, I think.

746
00:41:42,956 --> 00:41:47,179
I remember the 90s when every PC game came with a map,

747
00:41:47,439 --> 00:41:50,281
a keyboard map, to show you what all the buttons did.

748
00:41:50,301 --> 00:41:54,104
So I think it's just sort of wise to try and keep controls

749
00:41:54,164 --> 00:41:57,246
as elegant and minimal as possible, especially with a game like this.

750
00:41:58,027 --> 00:41:59,508
There's one other question that sort of...

751
00:42:00,967 --> 00:42:02,187
It's honestly beyond my knowledge,

752
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:03,668
but I think it could get to an interesting answer,

753
00:42:03,708 --> 00:42:05,429
which is some people keep asking about something

754
00:42:05,469 --> 00:42:06,350
called the TrueFlat.

755
00:42:07,010 --> 00:42:08,231
What happened to the TrueFlat?

756
00:42:08,271 --> 00:42:11,593
Was there at some point a different system in place

757
00:42:11,613 --> 00:42:15,375
where there were TrueFlat landscape options or something?

758
00:42:15,415 --> 00:42:17,296
Mike, can you shed more light on what TrueFlat was

759
00:42:17,336 --> 00:42:17,776
and where it went?

760
00:42:17,796 --> 00:42:22,419
I mean, so yeah, it was sort of an accident of development,

761
00:42:22,439 --> 00:42:23,920
too, which was that you can ...

762
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:26,722
So there's a tool in the game, like your deform tool,

763
00:42:26,742 --> 00:42:27,702
and you enter a flattened mode.

764
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:32,443
Yeah. I can now demonstrate because I got a canister with dirt in it.

765
00:42:34,644 --> 00:42:38,067
And the flattened mode just basically like takes whatever surface, whatever surface you're

766
00:42:38,427 --> 00:42:46,733
mousing over, you can extend that surface in all directions. And the players have discovered that

767
00:42:47,113 --> 00:42:54,179
there were certain like very specific angles that were kind of universal, absolute angles in the

768
00:42:54,199 --> 00:42:55,500
game space. So they would change.

769
00:42:55,956 --> 00:42:58,097
relative to the surface of the planet as you move around it,

770
00:42:58,177 --> 00:43:02,160
but certain absolute angles that seems to get perfectly flat

771
00:43:03,421 --> 00:43:11,085
surfaces where there was absolutely no visible polygon

772
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:12,986
edges inside that surface.

773
00:43:13,907 --> 00:43:17,449
And those tended to be on either the,

774
00:43:17,689 --> 00:43:19,250
I mentioned that the game's on a voxel grid,

775
00:43:19,791 --> 00:43:24,113
so either any surface that was aligned with that cube face.

776
00:43:24,738 --> 00:43:27,641
for certain divisions, so like sort of 45-degree angles

777
00:43:27,681 --> 00:43:29,923
between those spaces, would produce a surface like that.

778
00:43:30,964 --> 00:43:32,104
We didn't, we certainly didn't,

779
00:43:32,305 --> 00:43:33,766
and then some players have noticed

780
00:43:33,786 --> 00:43:35,487
that since we released the new game,

781
00:43:35,507 --> 00:43:39,811
it's been harder for them to find those angles

782
00:43:39,851 --> 00:43:40,431
and those surfaces.

783
00:43:41,112 --> 00:43:43,934
We certainly didn't do anything intentional to affect that.

784
00:43:44,314 --> 00:43:49,399
As far as I know, the code is basically the same,

785
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:52,541
but it is something, you know,

786
00:43:52,601 --> 00:43:53,122
there have been.

787
00:43:55,089 --> 00:43:58,212
So the voxel side of the system really totally changed,

788
00:43:58,392 --> 00:44:02,676
but the polygonization side is the same algorithm.

789
00:44:02,736 --> 00:44:05,278
So there might be some tuning changes that were made

790
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:06,899
that have affected that.

791
00:44:06,939 --> 00:44:11,963
So it's something that we'll look into.

792
00:44:12,344 --> 00:44:14,005
There was a time in development where,

793
00:44:14,446 --> 00:44:16,107
I guess as developers, we were like,

794
00:44:16,167 --> 00:44:17,889
oh, it should be fine now.

795
00:44:17,949 --> 00:44:19,110
Because there was a time in development

796
00:44:19,150 --> 00:44:21,191
where the flattened tool,

797
00:44:22,012 --> 00:44:23,673
if you weren't on one of these kind of true flat,

798
00:44:25,055 --> 00:44:28,056
You really couldn't get anything even resembling

799
00:44:28,196 --> 00:44:30,657
a perfectly flat surface.

800
00:44:30,677 --> 00:44:34,639
It would be like gameplay flat as in you can walk on it.

801
00:44:34,659 --> 00:44:37,561
But it wouldn't look perfectly flat.

802
00:44:38,341 --> 00:44:42,063
You'd get some noise.

803
00:44:42,844 --> 00:44:46,105
During Early Access last year, we made some improvements

804
00:44:46,125 --> 00:44:47,986
to that so that on almost any angle,

805
00:44:48,026 --> 00:44:49,247
you get what is.

806
00:44:51,361 --> 00:44:54,342
I think to an untrained eye, it would look like a totally flat surface.

807
00:44:54,842 --> 00:44:57,904
But I think that the players who are really astute, creative players

808
00:44:58,404 --> 00:45:00,905
can, you know, have been pointing out that they are still getting,

809
00:45:01,825 --> 00:45:04,346
it isn't the true flat that they are, that they consider true flat.

810
00:45:04,386 --> 00:45:07,448
So it is something that we're aware of and we'll look at.

811
00:45:07,468 --> 00:45:10,909
It's not the truest true flat, but that sounds pretty true flat to me.

812
00:45:12,630 --> 00:45:15,511
I kind of want to know how this game has done.

813
00:45:17,307 --> 00:45:20,228
such a great job of building and maintaining a community over the years.

814
00:45:20,268 --> 00:45:23,229
Because I remember when you started, you got a lot of buzz from those GIFs.

815
00:45:23,349 --> 00:45:26,169
It's a very attractive, very, very GIFable game.

816
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:28,690
And at the time, there was like really nothing like it.

817
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:30,930
But that was like two or three years ago now.

818
00:45:31,271 --> 00:45:33,931
And yet here we are. You've launched into 1.0.

819
00:45:34,751 --> 00:45:35,852
And you seem to be doing quite well.

820
00:45:35,952 --> 00:45:38,312
And you've got a great community here in chat.

821
00:45:38,792 --> 00:45:40,533
You seem to be good on Twitter and everywhere.

822
00:45:40,573 --> 00:45:43,453
So I kind of want to know, you know, even if you weren't directly involved in it,

823
00:45:43,473 --> 00:45:43,573
like.

824
00:45:44,344 --> 00:45:47,985
What did you learn about what it takes to grow and sustain a community around a game

825
00:45:49,105 --> 00:45:50,485
over the course of years of development?

826
00:45:52,606 --> 00:45:57,727
I think treating everyone as much as possible with as much respect as possible is kind of

827
00:45:57,747 --> 00:46:02,408
your first and golden rule. Nice.

828
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:10,610
Yeah, the community was built initially from, I think the biggest thing was like our hashtag

829
00:46:10,650 --> 00:46:13,250
screenshot Saturday posts like from like three years ago.

830
00:46:15,793 --> 00:46:18,034
And yeah, I don't know.

831
00:46:18,054 --> 00:46:20,335
I think that we really respect our community,

832
00:46:20,615 --> 00:46:23,697
and we made an effort to reach to them

833
00:46:23,817 --> 00:46:25,338
through things like our blog,

834
00:46:25,518 --> 00:46:26,979
which kind of brought people into the studio

835
00:46:27,079 --> 00:46:28,840
and introduced them to the team as individuals,

836
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:34,443
hoping to allow people to get to know who we are

837
00:46:35,063 --> 00:46:38,726
and how a day maybe looks inside the studio,

838
00:46:38,746 --> 00:46:42,688
which gives people more of a sense of a relationship with us.

839
00:46:44,421 --> 00:46:49,285
We also, you know, we brought in Joe, Joe Tirado, who's our,

840
00:46:50,305 --> 00:46:51,846
who's like our community manager,

841
00:46:52,167 --> 00:46:54,608
and at least that's one of his responsibilities.

842
00:46:55,389 --> 00:46:58,171
And so, you know, that's a full-time role on the team.

843
00:46:58,331 --> 00:47:02,814
And so his job is to make sure that there's always

844
00:47:02,834 --> 00:47:04,035
somebody engaging with the community

845
00:47:04,095 --> 00:47:05,996
while the rest of us are working

846
00:47:06,056 --> 00:47:10,379
and making sure that we, he gives us very regular reports

847
00:47:10,439 --> 00:47:11,540
of like what people are saying.

848
00:47:12,803 --> 00:47:18,968
So when you're on the forums and you're either saying something is great or you're complaining about something,

849
00:47:20,509 --> 00:47:22,490
we definitely hear about it, we're not ignoring it.

850
00:47:23,051 --> 00:47:26,973
And we get like, you know, Joe's fighting for you, he's always there,

851
00:47:27,334 --> 00:47:30,716
being like, this is the biggest issue on the community's mind, this is what we need to think about.

852
00:47:31,797 --> 00:47:33,098
And we take that stuff very seriously.

853
00:47:33,858 --> 00:47:35,840
I think it's helped us a lot that the game...

854
00:47:38,286 --> 00:47:40,106
This is a non-violent, non-competitive game,

855
00:47:40,426 --> 00:47:44,308
and I think that the type of people in the community

856
00:47:44,368 --> 00:47:48,910
reflect that, and they are just really nice people,

857
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:50,530
and I really love this community.

858
00:47:51,371 --> 00:47:52,411
Right on. Nice.

859
00:47:52,471 --> 00:47:54,252
We're getting to the end of our hour here,

860
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:55,232
so please, anyone, if you have ...

861
00:47:56,163 --> 00:47:58,086
Great questions, please drop them in chat.

862
00:47:58,206 --> 00:47:59,668
Brian, go ahead. Sorry to talk over you.

863
00:47:59,708 --> 00:48:01,411
I have no questions. I was just saying, nice.

864
00:48:01,491 --> 00:48:04,455
I think it's always cool when devs...

865
00:48:04,555 --> 00:48:07,520
I think it's the most cool thing about that to me is that when devs recognize that

866
00:48:08,060 --> 00:48:10,544
the content of their game informs the community they get.

867
00:48:10,845 --> 00:48:12,206
And it's cool to hear that, like...

868
00:48:13,097 --> 00:48:15,538
You probably didn't say, oh, we're going to make a nonviolent game,

869
00:48:15,558 --> 00:48:18,019
we'll get a nonviolent community, a non-aggressive community.

870
00:48:18,479 --> 00:48:22,441
But it's cool that relationship is out there and that understanding.

871
00:48:23,221 --> 00:48:25,002
Anyway, I'm going to try and get the smelter up and running.

872
00:48:25,022 --> 00:48:29,343
There's a good question here from Chunky Spaceman, who wants to know,

873
00:48:29,923 --> 00:48:31,344
with this game being procedurally generated,

874
00:48:31,364 --> 00:48:34,165
are the purple landmarks totally random, or is there some kind of system,

875
00:48:34,205 --> 00:48:38,767
like a grid or a latitude longitude, that chooses exactly where they spawn?

876
00:48:40,627 --> 00:48:41,588
Yeah, that's a good observation.

877
00:48:41,910 --> 00:48:43,992
The purple landmarks are not actually,

878
00:48:44,472 --> 00:48:45,553
they're one of the few things in the game

879
00:48:45,593 --> 00:48:47,574
that are not really procedurally chosen.

880
00:48:47,614 --> 00:48:48,935
So their locations are not random.

881
00:48:49,555 --> 00:48:55,179
They occur at specific kind of geometric points

882
00:48:56,219 --> 00:48:56,740
on the planet.

883
00:48:56,880 --> 00:48:57,740
So if you think of the,

884
00:48:58,441 --> 00:49:01,182
so there's, I don't know,

885
00:49:01,283 --> 00:49:02,884
I won't give too many details,

886
00:49:03,044 --> 00:49:04,164
so the players aren't given,

887
00:49:04,184 --> 00:49:06,005
so I'm not giving everything away,

888
00:49:06,086 --> 00:49:09,468
but you can think of the planet as like a D&D dice.

889
00:49:10,317 --> 00:49:11,998
Okay, I'm back on board.

890
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,759
Alex, just...

891
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,862
Are we talking D20, D12, D8? How are you feeling?

892
00:49:17,022 --> 00:49:18,703
I didn't want to give that away.

893
00:49:19,443 --> 00:49:19,843
Okay.

894
00:49:19,883 --> 00:49:21,184
I think it's probably common knowledge now.

895
00:49:21,525 --> 00:49:25,867
If you've never played the game, then it's something to discover.

896
00:49:26,228 --> 00:49:26,628
All right.

897
00:49:28,769 --> 00:49:33,552
So, I got so excited about D20s there, I lost the actual answer to the question.

898
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:37,315
If you think of it as a D20, then how does it actually know where to put those?

899
00:49:37,855 --> 00:49:39,916
Then, like, the chambers would be at points.

900
00:49:40,356 --> 00:49:41,196
I'm going to use the corms.

901
00:49:41,757 --> 00:49:42,937
Oh, that's good. Yeah.

902
00:49:42,977 --> 00:49:44,258
Someone in chat says it's a polyhedron.

903
00:49:44,498 --> 00:49:45,759
That's the word you're looking for. Thank you.

904
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:51,862
Thank you very much. Anyway, I kind of want to know,

905
00:49:51,982 --> 00:49:53,963
and I think this question has been going through chat as well,

906
00:49:54,523 --> 00:49:57,485
and I sort of held off because it's unfortunately broad,

907
00:49:57,525 --> 00:49:58,726
but where do you go from here?

908
00:49:58,826 --> 00:50:01,027
I mean, this is a solid 1.0 release.

909
00:50:01,087 --> 00:50:06,350
It seems like a totally respectable dev time.

910
00:50:06,750 --> 00:50:09,351
Are you going to stick with this project for a while,

911
00:50:09,371 --> 00:50:09,892
and do you have...

912
00:50:10,423 --> 00:50:17,428
a thought for how you build out a game like this that is so, sort of like, it builds itself

913
00:50:17,488 --> 00:50:21,171
out in so many ways that it's hard to understand how you would immediately expand upon it.

914
00:50:21,191 --> 00:50:23,392
So like, do you intend to stick with this game for a while?

915
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:24,893
Is there new work going on at the studio?

916
00:50:24,913 --> 00:50:25,794
Where are you going from here?

917
00:50:26,835 --> 00:50:30,397
Oh yeah, for now we're definitely sticking with Astroneer and there's a lot of support

918
00:50:30,437 --> 00:50:35,421
planned for it, both in terms of improvements and fixes and new content.

919
00:50:35,441 --> 00:50:36,102
I think it's a great game.

920
00:50:36,647 --> 00:50:42,732
It's a sandbox game, which means it's super easy to just add new things that you can play with.

921
00:50:42,752 --> 00:50:51,801
We really look at it as a toy box, and so we just want to give people cool things to do and to mess around with.

922
00:50:52,121 --> 00:50:56,185
And then beyond that, we certainly don't think that this is the end of Astroneer.

923
00:50:56,565 --> 00:51:01,450
We'll see more of Astroneer in terms of more significant...

924
00:51:02,907 --> 00:51:06,310
So whether that means major expansions or a new game,

925
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:08,051
we don't know yet.

926
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:09,672
We're at least not ready to talk about it.

927
00:51:10,413 --> 00:51:11,033
Yeah, fair enough.

928
00:51:11,734 --> 00:51:14,435
There's a couple other really fun, small questions

929
00:51:14,455 --> 00:51:15,897
that I have overlooked here.

930
00:51:15,917 --> 00:51:17,278
And so if we got time, I'm going to throw them out.

931
00:51:18,338 --> 00:51:20,380
JDLENL wants to know, still want to know,

932
00:51:20,460 --> 00:51:22,341
who came up with the icons for the resources?

933
00:51:25,043 --> 00:51:28,586
The resource icons were made by a super cool artist

934
00:51:28,606 --> 00:51:29,766
that we worked with named John K.

935
00:51:31,863 --> 00:51:32,964
I feel like I've heard of John K.

936
00:51:34,025 --> 00:51:38,209
He actually works, if you guys know Fangamer.

937
00:51:38,690 --> 00:51:39,531
Yeah, right.

938
00:51:39,711 --> 00:51:41,453
He does a lot of air stuff as well.

939
00:51:41,533 --> 00:51:45,317
So if there's similarities in style there, that's why.

940
00:51:46,042 --> 00:51:48,544
I'm going to swing by Chinny D's question.

941
00:51:49,364 --> 00:51:53,387
Chinny D would like to say that in an industry where colorblind modes are not a standard,

942
00:51:53,427 --> 00:51:55,749
there are a lot of games where I can struggle to tell things apart.

943
00:51:56,169 --> 00:52:00,572
Props to the dev team on great labels and icons where a colorblind mode just isn't necessary for me.

944
00:52:00,592 --> 00:52:03,334
I also want to apologize to Chinny specifically.

945
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:07,998
I made a rough joke about being colorblind at the start of the stream,

946
00:52:08,378 --> 00:52:10,880
and mostly that was me riffing on me stumbling over words,

947
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,502
and I did not mean to offend you, Chinny.

948
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:15,003
Sorry about that.

949
00:52:17,478 --> 00:52:20,701
Anyway, so good job on the not needing color blend mode, I guess.

950
00:52:22,983 --> 00:52:25,125
Yeah, I mean, that's one of the advantages of, I guess,

951
00:52:25,545 --> 00:52:29,309
the diegetic style is that we can use profile

952
00:52:30,510 --> 00:52:32,552
of the objects a lot more to disambiguate them.

953
00:52:33,112 --> 00:52:34,714
Yeah, that's that's been pretty important.

954
00:52:35,454 --> 00:52:36,175
That begs the question.

955
00:52:36,836 --> 00:52:39,838
What kind of thought, if any, have you as a team given into accessibility

956
00:52:39,939 --> 00:52:40,719
options for this game?

957
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:43,902
I mean, it's it's a it's an important question that we keep.

958
00:52:44,519 --> 00:52:49,101
It feels like every year at GDC there's three or four panels that are like, hey, just think

959
00:52:49,161 --> 00:52:52,142
about color blindness and accessibility and that kind of thing.

960
00:52:52,162 --> 00:52:54,943
So how has that been a factor in Astroneer's development?

961
00:52:55,384 --> 00:52:57,124
Yeah, it's been a factor.

962
00:52:57,144 --> 00:52:59,665
So color blindness is something that we actively thought about.

963
00:53:00,446 --> 00:53:05,368
But since we launched, I don't think that we did as good a job as we could of thinking

964
00:53:05,388 --> 00:53:06,949
about accessibility more broadly.

965
00:53:07,249 --> 00:53:12,151
And since we launched, we did get some feedback about the control layout.

966
00:53:13,331 --> 00:53:17,973
and where you have to use maybe multiple inputs at a time

967
00:53:18,033 --> 00:53:21,455
or hold down buttons being quite difficult for players

968
00:53:22,656 --> 00:53:26,157
who may not be fully able-bodied.

969
00:53:26,398 --> 00:53:28,679
And so that's something that we've taken to heart.

970
00:53:28,859 --> 00:53:31,940
And so we're going to try to do a better job

971
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:35,622
to think about that as far as more options in the controls.

972
00:53:35,642 --> 00:53:39,044
So that tends to mean wherever you can have an option

973
00:53:40,665 --> 00:53:42,986
to change something from a hold to a toggle, things like that.

974
00:53:43,608 --> 00:53:46,710
I go a long way, so we're going to think more about that stuff.

975
00:53:47,310 --> 00:53:51,933
Nice. Boy, we have so much good stuff in this chat.

976
00:53:51,953 --> 00:53:54,875
I don't want to ask any questions because this is all fantastic.

977
00:53:55,876 --> 00:53:59,038
Thank you guys. Thank you guys for helping do our job for us.

978
00:53:59,078 --> 00:54:00,679
I guess you're asking great questions

979
00:54:00,719 --> 00:54:02,940
that help us learn more about game development.

980
00:54:03,601 --> 00:54:07,423
Yeah. Actually, I want to talk about sales

981
00:54:07,623 --> 00:54:08,604
because we did talk about that,

982
00:54:08,624 --> 00:54:12,086
and I'm just kind of curious to get your take on it, Brendan.

983
00:54:12,106 --> 00:54:12,186
When...

984
00:54:12,748 --> 00:54:14,389
When you started out, you were such a small team.

985
00:54:15,090 --> 00:54:18,593
And I can't imagine that your estimates for this game

986
00:54:19,354 --> 00:54:21,115
went out this far, but maybe they did.

987
00:54:21,175 --> 00:54:24,358
Tell me, how has the reception of this game

988
00:54:24,398 --> 00:54:26,160
and the sales of this game so far

989
00:54:26,460 --> 00:54:29,282
met with your initial expectations for the project

990
00:54:29,302 --> 00:54:30,243
when you first started out?

991
00:54:32,065 --> 00:54:35,468
I mean, well, so when we first started out,

992
00:54:35,508 --> 00:54:37,229
we would tell ourselves that we would never expand

993
00:54:37,289 --> 00:54:38,750
beyond 10 people.

994
00:54:39,691 --> 00:54:40,632
And the team is now...

995
00:54:42,731 --> 00:54:44,812
21 people in total.

996
00:54:45,552 --> 00:54:49,173
And that's just been what we felt we needed

997
00:54:49,213 --> 00:54:50,073
to support this game.

998
00:54:50,394 --> 00:54:53,395
And so this sale, I mean,

999
00:54:53,475 --> 00:54:55,916
and we've had the sales to be able to support that team,

1000
00:54:55,936 --> 00:54:58,577
at least, you know, at least for now, still surviving.

1001
00:54:59,597 --> 00:55:01,057
But yeah, it's one of the things

1002
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,698
that we just blew our minds.

1003
00:55:03,458 --> 00:55:07,760
We, when it was the handful of us at the start,

1004
00:55:07,780 --> 00:55:08,680
I think we were six people.

1005
00:55:09,113 --> 00:55:11,454
when we actually pushed the launch button for early access.

1006
00:55:12,754 --> 00:55:17,656
And I was like, if we sold 40,000 copies,

1007
00:55:18,836 --> 00:55:22,017
that would have been enough for us to scrape by and at least,

1008
00:55:23,017 --> 00:55:26,158
you know, it wouldn't have paid back anything that we'd already put in, but

1009
00:55:26,358 --> 00:55:29,778
we would have at least been able to put food on the table and continue

1010
00:55:30,479 --> 00:55:34,600
scraping by that year. So I was like, okay, if we can sell between 40 and 80

1011
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:35,720
thousand, like that would be nice.

1012
00:55:37,953 --> 00:55:44,576
And so, you know, since I think we sold almost a million copies in the first year, it was crazy.

1013
00:55:46,856 --> 00:55:53,739
And I think that that put us on the one hand, of course, it's amazing.

1014
00:55:54,159 --> 00:55:56,020
And it's allowed us to build the company.

1015
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,822
And on the other hand, we've totally failed at planning for success in that way.

1016
00:56:01,906 --> 00:56:06,470
And I think maybe a more experienced team would have looked at the social media response

1017
00:56:06,550 --> 00:56:10,112
level that we were getting and known, like, okay, this game is going to succeed.

1018
00:56:10,893 --> 00:56:16,017
And had we known that, like, my biggest regret personally is that we didn't kind of prepare

1019
00:56:16,037 --> 00:56:16,317
for that.

1020
00:56:16,357 --> 00:56:19,219
We didn't start hiring until after the game had come out into early access.

1021
00:56:20,260 --> 00:56:24,103
We really kind of were caught on the back foot in terms of the number of players, the

1022
00:56:24,283 --> 00:56:29,147
amount of interest, the demand for new updates, which meant at the beginning we were quite

1023
00:56:29,187 --> 00:56:31,509
slow kind of getting off the ground just because we had all of the.

1024
00:56:32,200 --> 00:56:34,560
like all the infrastructure of a company to kind of put together.

1025
00:56:35,020 --> 00:56:36,221
Yeah.

1026
00:56:36,961 --> 00:56:39,802
So it's been an amazing...

1027
00:56:39,822 --> 00:56:42,903
You know, all we ever wanted was to come together

1028
00:56:43,223 --> 00:56:45,983
and build a little company

1029
00:56:46,023 --> 00:56:48,424
where we could make the kind of games we wanted to make.

1030
00:56:49,044 --> 00:56:50,645
It's sort of a cliche story,

1031
00:56:50,685 --> 00:56:54,246
but we're super grateful that Astroneer actually made that happen for us.

1032
00:56:55,326 --> 00:56:57,206
Yeah, it's always great to see it work out.

1033
00:56:57,907 --> 00:57:00,267
It's a rare occurrence, but it's fantastic.

1034
00:57:01,080 --> 00:57:03,927
Brian, you got any last minute questions you want to sneak in before we wrap this sucker up?

1035
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:08,473
Uh, nope, I think it's a good time to, uh, um...

1036
00:57:09,394 --> 00:57:13,415
Someone says I need to put the damn medium windmill on a platform so I can get more power.

1037
00:57:13,495 --> 00:57:15,376
Okay. Yeah. I'll work on that.

1038
00:57:15,796 --> 00:57:15,976
Um...

1039
00:57:16,737 --> 00:57:18,017
Learn to play. No, I'm just kidding.

1040
00:57:18,037 --> 00:57:18,678
Learn to play.

1041
00:57:18,758 --> 00:57:19,018
Great.

1042
00:57:19,358 --> 00:57:19,518
Yeah.

1043
00:57:20,118 --> 00:57:22,459
Uh, I don't know. I like my little base. It's moving along slowly.

1044
00:57:22,499 --> 00:57:24,540
I can just... God, it's just such a peaceful game.

1045
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:27,441
It's just nice to just poke around and, like, figure things out.

1046
00:57:27,841 --> 00:57:28,302
Um, although...

1047
00:57:28,322 --> 00:57:30,222
Lay down tethers. As many tethers as you can.

1048
00:57:30,282 --> 00:57:31,823
I just want some aluminum.

1049
00:57:32,243 --> 00:57:32,823
Tether everywhere.

1050
00:57:33,452 --> 00:57:33,812
Oh boy.

1051
00:57:35,174 --> 00:57:39,598
Yeah, streaming is always like, oh, we're here to talk about game dev, but I also have

1052
00:57:39,618 --> 00:57:40,439
to not suck.

1053
00:57:42,021 --> 00:57:43,502
Anyway, thank you all in chat for watching.

1054
00:57:43,522 --> 00:57:44,684
You've been a wonderful crowd.

1055
00:57:44,744 --> 00:57:46,005
Thank you for your good questions.

1056
00:57:46,085 --> 00:57:47,727
Brendan, thank you for joining us today.

1057
00:57:47,747 --> 00:57:49,148
Yeah, thanks guys.

1058
00:57:49,168 --> 00:57:49,769
It's been a pleasure.

1059
00:57:50,044 --> 00:57:52,765
Yeah, some mild plugging that I have to do.

1060
00:57:53,265 --> 00:57:55,506
For those of you who are game developers yourselves,

1061
00:57:55,546 --> 00:57:57,607
or interested in the art and business of making games,

1062
00:57:58,147 --> 00:57:59,247
we would encourage you to check out

1063
00:57:59,307 --> 00:58:01,308
the 2019 Game Developers Conference.

1064
00:58:01,388 --> 00:58:04,269
It's going on next month, March 18th, the 20th segment.

1065
00:58:04,769 --> 00:58:06,790
You can get registered if you scroll down

1066
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,711
and click on the button that says Register for GDC.

1067
00:58:09,751 --> 00:58:10,692
There's all kinds of great talks.

1068
00:58:10,712 --> 00:58:12,092
There's programming talks, narrative talks,

1069
00:58:12,812 --> 00:58:13,753
community management talks,

1070
00:58:13,793 --> 00:58:15,093
wherever you want to do in games.

1071
00:58:16,034 --> 00:58:17,535
It's a really cool place to check all that out.

1072
00:58:18,296 --> 00:58:26,283
And then, you know, Alex and I also do things with Gamma Sutra, so you can read Gamma Sutra as well for more answers to these kinds of questions.

1073
00:58:27,164 --> 00:58:31,228
We are owned under the same parent company, which is why we're able to do this kind of work.

1074
00:58:34,080 --> 00:58:40,482
It looks like Joe is dropping or someone dropped the Discord for Astroneer in, so I guess that's

1075
00:58:40,542 --> 00:58:40,722
it.

1076
00:58:40,742 --> 00:58:43,343
I think all y'all know where to answer those questions.

1077
00:58:44,024 --> 00:58:46,765
With that, Brendan, have a good day, I think.

1078
00:58:47,945 --> 00:58:48,125
All right.

1079
00:58:48,145 --> 00:58:48,645
You too, guys.

1080
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:49,726
Thank you, everyone.

1081
00:58:49,846 --> 00:58:50,226
Bye.

1082
00:58:50,246 --> 00:58:50,306
Bye.

1083
00:58:50,866 --> 00:58:51,866
Bye.

1084
00:58:55,108 --> 00:58:56,288
In space, no one can hear you.

1085
00:58:57,429 --> 00:58:58,049
Drop a tether.

1086
00:58:58,609 --> 00:58:58,889
I don't know.
