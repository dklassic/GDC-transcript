1
00:00:04,244 --> 00:00:08,445
video game data. If you're not here to see this, you're in the wrong room. My name is

2
00:00:08,445 --> 00:00:12,306
Jeffrey Zatkin. I'm going to introduce myself, introduce what we're doing, and then hop right

3
00:00:12,306 --> 00:00:17,328
into data. We're going to be doing about 75 data slides in an hour today. So hold onto

4
00:00:17,328 --> 00:00:22,169
your seats. As I said, my name is Jeffrey Zatkin. I've had a split career. For my first

5
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:25,730
10 years in the game industry, I was a game designer, including having had the privilege

6
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:29,511
of working on the original EverQuest team. Before that, I was an indie dev, though we

7
00:00:29,511 --> 00:00:30,911
weren't called that at the time.

8
00:00:31,432 --> 00:00:33,094
For my second 10 years in the industry,

9
00:00:33,094 --> 00:00:35,578
I founded, ran, owned, and have now moved on

10
00:00:35,578 --> 00:00:38,962
from EDAR, which is the world's biggest video game

11
00:00:38,962 --> 00:00:40,104
specific market.

12
00:00:40,104 --> 00:00:42,107
Let me start again.

13
00:00:42,107 --> 00:00:46,052
The world's biggest video game specific market research firm.

14
00:00:46,713 --> 00:00:48,913
And at the beginning of my third decade in the game industry,

15
00:00:48,913 --> 00:00:51,914
I've started a new VR-focused startup called Experiment 7.

16
00:00:51,914 --> 00:00:55,575
This talk covers a broad range of industry trends.

17
00:00:55,575 --> 00:00:57,555
Some of these will be familiar to you

18
00:00:57,555 --> 00:00:59,496
who saw this last year, or the year before that,

19
00:00:59,496 --> 00:01:00,856
or the year before that.

20
00:01:00,856 --> 00:01:03,096
This is year number six of this talk.

21
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:05,037
However, all of the numbers have been updated

22
00:01:05,037 --> 00:01:06,357
through the very end of 2016.

23
00:01:06,357 --> 00:01:10,578
So some of this is new, and some of this is similar.

24
00:01:10,578 --> 00:01:12,438
But it's often good to know that some of the things

25
00:01:12,438 --> 00:01:15,119
are still the same in addition to what's actually changing.

26
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:21,343
So, EDAR, one of their primary focuses is game attribution, or the DNA pieces that make

27
00:01:21,343 --> 00:01:22,044
up games.

28
00:01:22,044 --> 00:01:24,326
You can think of EDAR as the Game Genome Project.

29
00:01:24,326 --> 00:01:26,848
They track most game attributes you can think of.

30
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,189
And this takes a very large team.

31
00:01:28,189 --> 00:01:33,693
There's more than 40 full-time dedicated researchers, analysts, engineers, and QA professionals

32
00:01:33,693 --> 00:01:38,077
working to track about 100,000 commercially released games, gaming accessories, and hardware.

33
00:01:38,597 --> 00:01:42,703
And this covers pretty much every retail and digital console,

34
00:01:42,703 --> 00:01:44,947
handheld, PC, iOS, and Android game

35
00:01:44,947 --> 00:01:47,230
that has ever reached the top 50 of any chart

36
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:49,774
for the mobile stuff, and going back

37
00:01:49,774 --> 00:01:52,097
about 20 years for the console and PC stuff.

38
00:01:52,097 --> 00:01:54,841
Recently passed about 150 million unique data points.

39
00:01:55,693 --> 00:01:58,556
And they partner with a lot of people who do measurement data,

40
00:01:58,556 --> 00:02:01,399
sales, marketing, awareness, including NPD,

41
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,043
who purchased EDAR from Greg Short and I, the founders,

42
00:02:05,043 --> 00:02:05,664
last year.

43
00:02:05,664 --> 00:02:09,868
So all the data that you see here is collected by EDAR.

44
00:02:09,868 --> 00:02:11,189
So that is the source.

45
00:02:11,189 --> 00:02:13,112
Everything is sourced down in the corner

46
00:02:13,112 --> 00:02:14,553
and integrated into EDAR's system

47
00:02:14,553 --> 00:02:17,096
from some of the best in class measurement companies

48
00:02:17,096 --> 00:02:17,817
that we partner with.

49
00:02:19,078 --> 00:02:23,221
I am currently working as the creative director of Experiment 7, a studio I founded with a

50
00:02:23,221 --> 00:02:26,945
buddy of mine named Dimitri Desiridis, and we're making VR games for our Magic Table

51
00:02:26,945 --> 00:02:27,545
platform.

52
00:02:27,545 --> 00:02:31,749
And we make some awesome table-based games that you play in VR with your friends from

53
00:02:31,749 --> 00:02:33,270
around the world.

54
00:02:33,270 --> 00:02:37,153
We have a game in the Oculus Store, and another one coming out in about a month, which is

55
00:02:37,153 --> 00:02:41,978
an animated kind of wizard chess battle chess inspired by Dungeons & Dragons.

56
00:02:41,978 --> 00:02:45,260
And if you happen to be an investor in this space, hey, come by and say hi.

57
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:46,301
We're still closing around.

58
00:02:47,527 --> 00:02:50,089
So why am I giving this talk when I'm no longer at EDAR?

59
00:02:50,089 --> 00:02:52,351
Well, GDC being GDC and being awesome,

60
00:02:52,351 --> 00:02:55,393
you have to submit for the talk so far in advance,

61
00:02:55,393 --> 00:02:57,275
I actually hadn't sold my company at the time.

62
00:02:57,275 --> 00:02:59,076
So I chatted with our CEO and I said,

63
00:02:59,076 --> 00:03:01,498
well, if the sale goes through, I'm gonna come back,

64
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:04,461
we're gonna put one last one of these together and do it.

65
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:06,082
So if you see this talk next year,

66
00:03:06,082 --> 00:03:08,204
it will be somebody other than me,

67
00:03:08,204 --> 00:03:10,446
but we have a couple of really great speakers

68
00:03:10,446 --> 00:03:11,667
and analysts at EDAR still,

69
00:03:11,667 --> 00:03:12,988
so I hope the tradition carries on.

70
00:03:13,709 --> 00:03:18,831
And today, I'm going to tell you about some of the coolest things we've seen in the past

71
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:20,391
year backed up with data.

72
00:03:20,391 --> 00:03:24,733
So to get this talk, you do not have to take a picture every single slide, though you may

73
00:03:24,733 --> 00:03:25,473
if you like.

74
00:03:25,473 --> 00:03:29,675
Take a picture of that, send an email in, and you will get the deck in the mail in a

75
00:03:29,675 --> 00:03:30,575
couple of days.

76
00:03:30,575 --> 00:03:33,036
So I'm going to pause for a second for that.

77
00:03:33,036 --> 00:03:35,638
I will also show that slide again at the very, very end.

78
00:03:35,638 --> 00:03:37,798
So if you decide you want to take it, then go for it.

79
00:03:40,408 --> 00:03:42,850
OK, here we go.

80
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:46,473
So the gamers of today are entertainment consumers.

81
00:03:46,473 --> 00:03:48,735
And they're consuming entertainment on pretty much

82
00:03:48,735 --> 00:03:50,496
every possible medium.

83
00:03:50,496 --> 00:03:53,599
If you look at this point for the US, about 65% of the

84
00:03:53,599 --> 00:03:57,261
population has played a game in the recent past.

85
00:03:57,261 --> 00:04:01,184
We're taking pretty much every dedicated media device and

86
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,005
turning it into.

87
00:04:02,605 --> 00:04:05,848
a gaming population, or a gaming platform.

88
00:04:05,848 --> 00:04:08,050
And since last year was NA-Europe focused,

89
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:10,632
this year is more, excuse me, NA-Asia focused,

90
00:04:10,632 --> 00:04:12,234
this is more NA-Europe focused,

91
00:04:12,234 --> 00:04:13,995
since we flip every year back and forth.

92
00:04:15,843 --> 00:04:17,064
So who games?

93
00:04:17,064 --> 00:04:20,226
If you look at the ESA survey starting from 2007,

94
00:04:20,226 --> 00:04:22,628
whoops, hold on, I'm a slide ahead.

95
00:04:22,628 --> 00:04:26,491
So this is homes with a gaming console.

96
00:04:26,491 --> 00:04:28,492
So at this point, according to the ESA,

97
00:04:28,492 --> 00:04:29,773
when we went up to about 2010,

98
00:04:29,773 --> 00:04:31,754
two thirds of American households

99
00:04:31,754 --> 00:04:33,155
had a gaming console in them.

100
00:04:33,956 --> 00:04:37,582
and then they missed a year and they backed it back down a little bit because what they'd

101
00:04:37,582 --> 00:04:41,709
been doing was counting consuls as opposed to counting consuls per household.

102
00:04:41,709 --> 00:04:46,777
So about half of American households have a consul in it, but on average the households

103
00:04:46,777 --> 00:04:48,960
that do have a consul have two of them in it.

104
00:04:49,421 --> 00:04:52,243
So there's a friggin' ton of consoles out there.

105
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,305
In addition to that, a majority of US households

106
00:04:54,305 --> 00:04:56,346
own a device that can be used to play video games.

107
00:04:56,346 --> 00:04:59,629
So at this point, if you look at America, North America,

108
00:04:59,629 --> 00:05:01,630
and pretty much across through Europe,

109
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:03,772
most households have some sort of device

110
00:05:03,772 --> 00:05:06,134
that can be used to access video gaming.

111
00:05:06,134 --> 00:05:09,637
And at the start of 2017, we have a lot of choices

112
00:05:09,637 --> 00:05:11,438
of where to game and a lot of hardware

113
00:05:11,438 --> 00:05:13,980
built specifically for that purpose.

114
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,021
So this is showing, oh.

115
00:05:15,722 --> 00:05:21,070
As a reminder that I forgot to say at the beginning, if you have a device that makes noise, like a cell phone, please silence it.

116
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:21,971
They're taping.

117
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:28,360
So hardware sales are very important, and this is showing hardware sales worldwide through

118
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,721
the end of 2016.

119
00:05:29,721 --> 00:05:34,584
And hardware sales are important because this is what determines your total potential market.

120
00:05:34,584 --> 00:05:40,168
For example, with about 50 million PS4s sold worldwide, the theoretical maximum sales of

121
00:05:40,168 --> 00:05:45,491
any PS4 game you make would be 50 million, one for every PS4 in existence.

122
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:50,658
Of course, there are ones, you know, that's of course the maximum. Nobody ever hits the maximum.

123
00:05:50,658 --> 00:05:53,302
But, you know, that is kind of why hardware is important.

124
00:05:53,302 --> 00:05:57,308
If you're trying to put out a game on something that's sold a thousand units total,

125
00:05:57,308 --> 00:05:59,832
the most copies you would sell would be a thousand.

126
00:06:01,217 --> 00:06:06,060
So the core 8th generation hardware, the PS4 and the Xbox One, are actually doing very

127
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:07,500
well on sales.

128
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:08,481
So how well?

129
00:06:08,481 --> 00:06:14,685
So what this graph shows is the generational hardware sales, sorted not by calendar date,

130
00:06:14,685 --> 00:06:18,247
but by quarters since the initial hardware release.

131
00:06:18,247 --> 00:06:22,570
This lets us kind of compare apples to apple sales for 7th and 8th generation hardware.

132
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:28,253
So the sales of 7th generation hardware, the 360, the PS3, and the Wii are in blue.

133
00:06:28,773 --> 00:06:32,455
And the eighth generation, the Xbox One, the PS4, and the Wii U

134
00:06:32,455 --> 00:06:33,915
are in gray.

135
00:06:33,915 --> 00:06:37,037
And you can see that the seventh generation is 36% higher,

136
00:06:37,037 --> 00:06:39,558
the blue line than the gray line.

137
00:06:39,558 --> 00:06:41,218
However, an interesting thing about this

138
00:06:41,218 --> 00:06:43,759
is that we are including the Nintendo hardware.

139
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,141
And the Wii hardware primarily targets non-core game players,

140
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:51,602
who over the last generation, in a lot of cases,

141
00:06:51,602 --> 00:06:53,843
have been migrating from consoles

142
00:06:53,843 --> 00:06:56,144
onto web and social mobile experiences.

143
00:06:56,964 --> 00:07:01,768
So if you remove the Wii and the Wii U from the hardware line,

144
00:07:01,768 --> 00:07:03,450
and you look at the core consoles that's

145
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:05,591
sailing into the core market, you

146
00:07:05,591 --> 00:07:08,454
can see red is the eighth generation,

147
00:07:08,454 --> 00:07:10,695
and yellow is the seventh generation,

148
00:07:10,695 --> 00:07:12,737
minus the Nintendo hardware.

149
00:07:12,737 --> 00:07:15,019
And at this point, you can see that at this point

150
00:07:15,019 --> 00:07:17,741
in the cycle, we've sold 34% more hardware

151
00:07:17,741 --> 00:07:20,043
into core consumers than the hardware we

152
00:07:20,043 --> 00:07:21,464
were selling last generation.

153
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:24,349
So the consoles are actually a head that are dedicated

154
00:07:24,349 --> 00:07:25,852
to the core consumer.

155
00:07:25,852 --> 00:07:28,598
And as I said, the more casual consumers

156
00:07:28,598 --> 00:07:29,940
have been moving to other platforms.

157
00:07:30,502 --> 00:07:33,604
And this is, in a lot of cases, true with the genres as well.

158
00:07:33,604 --> 00:07:36,785
So what we're looking at here, talking about the shift,

159
00:07:36,785 --> 00:07:39,486
is a shift from kind of a balanced portfolio

160
00:07:39,486 --> 00:07:42,167
across consoles of core and casual games

161
00:07:42,167 --> 00:07:44,128
to a more core-focused portfolio.

162
00:07:44,128 --> 00:07:47,010
So the numbers in blue are the percent

163
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:50,711
of sales for the seventh generation consoles by genre.

164
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,552
And we're only showing some of the genres here.

165
00:07:53,348 --> 00:07:56,589
And then gray is showing the eighth generation sales

166
00:07:56,589 --> 00:07:58,450
of those same genres.

167
00:07:58,450 --> 00:08:01,411
So you can see that some of the more casual genres

168
00:08:01,411 --> 00:08:03,051
are dropping down.

169
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:04,812
Kind of the mid-core are remaining static,

170
00:08:04,812 --> 00:08:07,173
and the core are increasing their number.

171
00:08:07,173 --> 00:08:10,614
And in the same way, the breakout genres on mobile

172
00:08:10,614 --> 00:08:11,534
are mobile-centric.

173
00:08:13,081 --> 00:08:15,442
Excuse me, I have the sniffles from the airplane.

174
00:08:15,442 --> 00:08:18,244
So what this shows here is the most played genres

175
00:08:18,244 --> 00:08:22,346
from a vast amount of surveys that we've done for age,

176
00:08:22,346 --> 00:08:25,687
basically adult gamers, age 18 plus.

177
00:08:25,687 --> 00:08:28,729
So blue is they only play that on mobile.

178
00:08:28,729 --> 00:08:32,011
Gray is they play it on mobile, PC, or console.

179
00:08:32,011 --> 00:08:34,312
And yellow is they play on PC or console.

180
00:08:34,312 --> 00:08:36,313
So you can kind of see this shift in genres,

181
00:08:36,313 --> 00:08:39,094
that some of them are very much mobile-centric,

182
00:08:39,094 --> 00:08:42,256
and others are more the PC console-centric.

183
00:08:42,936 --> 00:08:46,839
And that being said, what is very important to realize

184
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:51,303
is that most gamers play games on a variety of devices.

185
00:08:51,303 --> 00:08:53,525
There are almost no mobile gamers

186
00:08:53,525 --> 00:08:55,327
that only play games on phones.

187
00:08:55,327 --> 00:08:58,690
So we see that the gamers are playing games

188
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:00,271
across a variety of devices,

189
00:09:00,271 --> 00:09:01,632
but they're playing different games

190
00:09:01,632 --> 00:09:04,395
depending upon what device they have handy at the time

191
00:09:04,395 --> 00:09:06,877
or the actual amount of time they have for playing.

192
00:09:06,877 --> 00:09:08,919
And we'll be going more into that later.

193
00:09:10,230 --> 00:09:12,313
But of course, from the previous numbers,

194
00:09:12,313 --> 00:09:14,135
we're not just talking about consoles and handheld.

195
00:09:14,135 --> 00:09:16,078
This shows platform sales worldwide,

196
00:09:16,078 --> 00:09:20,163
including bringing in PC and iOS devices, the iPad

197
00:09:20,163 --> 00:09:21,244
and the iPhone.

198
00:09:22,761 --> 00:09:26,505
So PC is a hard thing to measure because of the quantity of PCs.

199
00:09:26,505 --> 00:09:29,668
You know, how many PCs have you owned across your lifetime?

200
00:09:29,668 --> 00:09:32,110
You know, that makes it really hard to get an active install base.

201
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,515
But this is up there, a very underreported PC hardware number,

202
00:09:37,515 --> 00:09:41,219
which is about 150 million, and I'm going to get back to where that number comes from later.

203
00:09:41,999 --> 00:09:45,982
So when we're bringing the iPhone and the iPad, you can see a good amount of sales there.

204
00:09:45,982 --> 00:09:50,386
You may notice that these are lower than their worldwide sales numbers.

205
00:09:50,386 --> 00:09:55,930
So what we're showing here is two-year hardware sales for the iPad and the iPhone.

206
00:09:55,930 --> 00:10:01,374
So that's 92 million iPads instead of the 350 million sold across lifetime, and the

207
00:10:01,374 --> 00:10:06,678
447 million iPhones instead of the 1.1 billion iPhones sold life to date.

208
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:08,038
And why?

209
00:10:08,038 --> 00:10:09,179
Well, because of data.

210
00:10:09,179 --> 00:10:13,721
So especially with phones, data shows that most people upgrade their phone every 12 to

211
00:10:13,721 --> 00:10:15,701
8, excuse me, every 18 to 24 months.

212
00:10:15,701 --> 00:10:21,164
So the average smartphone right now is about six months old, somewhere actually, sorry,

213
00:10:21,164 --> 00:10:23,725
in the six month to a one year range.

214
00:10:23,725 --> 00:10:28,607
So while technically there's 1.1 billion iPhones out there, if you take the last two year sales,

215
00:10:28,607 --> 00:10:33,288
that's 447 million, that's kind of the active install base that you're looking at.

216
00:10:34,504 --> 00:10:37,087
And by the way, one of the things to note, too,

217
00:10:37,087 --> 00:10:39,129
is that this is 92 million iPads.

218
00:10:39,129 --> 00:10:40,871
Last year, I was talking about 123 million

219
00:10:40,871 --> 00:10:42,633
in the two-year range.

220
00:10:42,633 --> 00:10:44,636
So that number has actually gone down,

221
00:10:44,636 --> 00:10:48,300
where the iPhone number is actually up 47 million

222
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:49,641
from last year when I was talking about it

223
00:10:49,641 --> 00:10:51,003
on the active two-year range.

224
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,225
And we'll get into that in a bit later as well.

225
00:10:53,886 --> 00:10:55,606
So why am I not showing Android?

226
00:10:55,606 --> 00:10:57,427
Well, Android fragmentation makes this

227
00:10:57,427 --> 00:10:59,607
a particularly difficult thing.

228
00:10:59,607 --> 00:11:00,767
I know I show this one every year.

229
00:11:00,767 --> 00:11:02,288
We always get a giggle.

230
00:11:02,288 --> 00:11:03,488
But Android's doing really well.

231
00:11:03,488 --> 00:11:05,388
There's a tremendous amount of phones out there.

232
00:11:05,388 --> 00:11:08,509
The problem is not every Android phone is powerful enough

233
00:11:08,509 --> 00:11:09,949
to play all games.

234
00:11:09,949 --> 00:11:11,530
And this makes it, again, very hard

235
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,710
to do a market sizing on something

236
00:11:13,710 --> 00:11:16,051
when you have a variety of different devices

237
00:11:16,051 --> 00:11:17,451
in this sort of fragmentation.

238
00:11:17,451 --> 00:11:18,851
But what it really comes down to is

239
00:11:18,851 --> 00:11:21,912
there's a lot of dedicated hardware on which to play games.

240
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:26,374
So speaking of dedicated hardware, VR got a lot of attention this year.

241
00:11:26,374 --> 00:11:29,097
We've had everything from skeptics to true believers.

242
00:11:29,097 --> 00:11:34,623
But a lot of it really comes down to, when will people buy VR hardware

243
00:11:34,623 --> 00:11:35,884
and make VR hardware a thing?

244
00:11:36,486 --> 00:11:37,767
Well, the thing is starting.

245
00:11:37,767 --> 00:11:41,268
Blue is showing life-to-date sales of the high-end VR

246
00:11:41,268 --> 00:11:44,330
hardware, the PS4, the Oculus, and the Vive.

247
00:11:44,330 --> 00:11:48,211
Gray shows integrated mobile, the Gear VR, and the Daydream.

248
00:11:48,211 --> 00:11:51,713
And the yellow shows snap and mobile, excluding cardboard.

249
00:11:51,713 --> 00:11:53,774
There is a lot of cardboard out there.

250
00:11:53,774 --> 00:11:56,295
I heard a figure that was somewhere around $80 million.

251
00:11:57,075 --> 00:11:59,616
And it's just Google's done a very good job of distributing

252
00:11:59,616 --> 00:12:01,016
that at a very low price.

253
00:12:01,016 --> 00:12:04,277
The second graph shows rough life to date revenue

254
00:12:04,277 --> 00:12:05,918
for the hardware.

255
00:12:05,918 --> 00:12:07,458
The integrated mobile VR hardware

256
00:12:07,458 --> 00:12:08,718
is a bit lower than you might think

257
00:12:08,718 --> 00:12:11,539
because of the amount of Samsung gears that came packaged

258
00:12:11,539 --> 00:12:13,380
in with their mobile devices.

259
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:15,880
A lot of people basically picked it up for free on promotion.

260
00:12:16,681 --> 00:12:19,122
But we're starting to build a critical mass of VR hardware,

261
00:12:19,122 --> 00:12:23,744
enough to begin to make a profitable VR ecosystem.

262
00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:26,305
And like each generation of hardware and type of hardware

263
00:12:26,305 --> 00:12:29,686
before it, consoles, PC, mobile, it

264
00:12:29,686 --> 00:12:31,667
takes time to build an ecosystem.

265
00:12:31,667 --> 00:12:33,728
And people always wonder, will there be one?

266
00:12:33,728 --> 00:12:35,669
Up until the point where suddenly everybody's like,

267
00:12:35,669 --> 00:12:36,609
oh, of course there is one.

268
00:12:36,609 --> 00:12:38,090
Why did we ever wonder?

269
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:39,570
And this is going to happen here as well,

270
00:12:39,570 --> 00:12:41,351
just like it's happened with every other dedicated

271
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:43,352
piece of hardware out there.

272
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,504
So speaking of hardware, the North American mobile market

273
00:12:47,504 --> 00:12:48,686
is maturing.

274
00:12:48,686 --> 00:12:51,369
We're actually beginning to see device saturation.

275
00:12:51,369 --> 00:12:54,554
At this point, more than 75% of North American adults

276
00:12:54,554 --> 00:12:55,575
own a smart device.

277
00:12:55,575 --> 00:12:58,620
And so there are fewer new device owners

278
00:12:58,620 --> 00:13:00,262
entering the market year on year.

279
00:13:00,802 --> 00:13:06,346
So what we're seeing here in blue is population that owns a smartphone or tablet, and in gray

280
00:13:06,346 --> 00:13:10,228
is population that plays games on their smartphone or tablet.

281
00:13:10,228 --> 00:13:15,771
And so what you're seeing is that decrease on the line, less and less new people getting

282
00:13:15,771 --> 00:13:17,792
it because we're hitting the saturation.

283
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:24,498
The gaming population is still actually increasing faster than the hardware adoption.

284
00:13:24,498 --> 00:13:29,423
So we haven't hit saturation on that yet, but it is slowing down.

285
00:13:29,423 --> 00:13:33,487
You know, gamers as a percentage of the population is still growing, but that being said, it

286
00:13:33,487 --> 00:13:38,171
is mathematically impossible to continue growing the percentage increase forever.

287
00:13:38,792 --> 00:13:43,080
And what that means in a lot of cases too is we need to get better about treating and

288
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:47,769
acquiring a lot of our mobile users because we don't have an infinite amount of them to

289
00:13:47,769 --> 00:13:50,574
flip through and burn and just grab the next batch.

290
00:13:52,552 --> 00:13:55,253
So dual device ownership is still very strong

291
00:13:55,253 --> 00:13:57,113
and strongly associated with revenue

292
00:13:57,113 --> 00:13:59,174
in North American and European markets,

293
00:13:59,174 --> 00:14:01,414
as many mobile users opt to play on both tablets

294
00:14:01,414 --> 00:14:03,295
and smartphone devices.

295
00:14:03,295 --> 00:14:08,076
And this is critical because a large percent of the revenue

296
00:14:08,076 --> 00:14:10,216
comes in from users who own both.

297
00:14:10,216 --> 00:14:14,037
At this point, 51% of active mobile gamers

298
00:14:14,037 --> 00:14:15,998
own both a smartphone and a tablet,

299
00:14:15,998 --> 00:14:18,098
and they generate 60% of the revenue.

300
00:14:18,844 --> 00:14:26,652
You know, that being said, this is down from 61% owned both last year, and they generated 70% of the revenue.

301
00:14:26,652 --> 00:14:34,000
Between 2015 and 2016, tabloid usage by adult mobile gamers has declined from 70% in 2015 to 59% this year.

302
00:14:35,561 --> 00:14:40,022
And a lot of this is because of the availability of large screen smartphone options.

303
00:14:40,022 --> 00:14:45,164
Basically, we now have ones that are big enough that people use that instead of going up to

304
00:14:45,164 --> 00:14:46,224
a full tablet.

305
00:14:46,224 --> 00:14:50,166
That being said, the Duo owners still do generate the vast majority of the revenue.

306
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:53,166
And in a lot of cases for tablets, where it had previously seen more mixed use, the tablet

307
00:14:53,166 --> 00:14:55,987
is becoming more commonly a living room device now.

308
00:14:55,987 --> 00:14:58,548
So if we look at Who Games, excuse me, let me take a sip.

309
00:15:04,987 --> 00:15:09,169
The demographic of people that game in America and in Europe

310
00:15:09,169 --> 00:15:11,130
and in, actually, all of North America

311
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:13,732
is a lot older than most people think.

312
00:15:13,732 --> 00:15:18,454
The average game of the US gamer, according to the ESA,

313
00:15:18,454 --> 00:15:20,655
rose from 29 years old in 2004 to 37 in 2011.

314
00:15:20,655 --> 00:15:24,237
And then we had a dip when they started measuring mobile.

315
00:15:24,237 --> 00:15:26,939
And that dropped the age, but then it shot it right back up

316
00:15:26,939 --> 00:15:30,220
as people besides children started playing games on them.

317
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:32,321
And it kind of permeated the ecosystem.

318
00:15:33,525 --> 00:15:34,686
So this is great.

319
00:15:34,686 --> 00:15:38,428
We've continued to expand the market by adding game players.

320
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,950
And average age of 35 is a very healthy thing,

321
00:15:40,950 --> 00:15:43,472
considering the lifespan of people

322
00:15:43,472 --> 00:15:45,554
in the North American states.

323
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:48,056
And if you look at the age distribution here,

324
00:15:48,056 --> 00:15:49,457
blue is 18 and under.

325
00:15:50,197 --> 00:15:53,899
Gray is 18 to 35, yellow is 36 to 39, and red is 50 plus.

326
00:15:53,899 --> 00:15:57,761
So yes, there are almost as many 50 plus gamers

327
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:02,183
as gamers under the age of 18, which is, again, fantastic.

328
00:16:02,183 --> 00:16:04,784
We have a well-distributed age demographic

329
00:16:04,784 --> 00:16:06,505
of game players in North America,

330
00:16:06,505 --> 00:16:08,506
and this represents a really large market

331
00:16:08,506 --> 00:16:10,207
expansion in our consumer base.

332
00:16:10,207 --> 00:16:12,948
There's been a longstanding myth that video games

333
00:16:12,948 --> 00:16:13,648
are for children.

334
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:18,073
Games in America have never been for children, at least in the past decade.

335
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:22,898
Children like to play games in the same way that children like movies and TVs and books and music,

336
00:16:22,898 --> 00:16:27,703
but games are another form of entertainment medium and they've permeated our culture

337
00:16:27,703 --> 00:16:32,068
and they're now played by pretty much everybody on a very wide variety of devices.

338
00:16:33,685 --> 00:16:37,148
If we look at mobile, kind of focusing down on some of this,

339
00:16:37,148 --> 00:16:41,151
the mobile market is also shifting older year on year.

340
00:16:41,151 --> 00:16:44,553
And we believe this is primarily due to an influx

341
00:16:44,553 --> 00:16:46,554
of late adopters coming into the market.

342
00:16:46,554 --> 00:16:49,837
And late adopters tend to be older and less tech savvy

343
00:16:49,837 --> 00:16:51,598
as part of the population.

344
00:16:51,598 --> 00:16:56,341
So blue here, this is showing total market size on age.

345
00:16:56,341 --> 00:16:57,102
Excuse me.

346
00:16:58,398 --> 00:16:59,438
Let me look at my graph.

347
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:02,600
This is showing age by groupings of people

348
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:04,321
on how they pay for mobile.

349
00:17:04,321 --> 00:17:06,482
So on the left are non-payers, people who never

350
00:17:06,482 --> 00:17:07,863
pay any money for this.

351
00:17:07,863 --> 00:17:11,385
And you can see blue is 2014, gray is 15, yellow is 2016.

352
00:17:11,385 --> 00:17:15,607
The age has gone up from 34 to 41.

353
00:17:15,607 --> 00:17:18,469
Payers are people who basically, on a yearly basis

354
00:17:18,469 --> 00:17:21,471
for their entire mobile spending habit,

355
00:17:21,471 --> 00:17:23,652
spend between a penny and $99.99.

356
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:29,256
And heavy payers pay $100 or more across their total gaming habit per year.

357
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:31,258
And again, this is just on the mobile spin.

358
00:17:31,258 --> 00:17:34,820
This doesn't count their console and their PC and their web and everything else.

359
00:17:34,820 --> 00:17:36,422
So this is purely mobile.

360
00:17:36,422 --> 00:17:39,844
You can see the age of the heavy payers has remained pretty constant

361
00:17:39,844 --> 00:17:42,086
while the non-payers and the payers have gone up.

362
00:17:42,086 --> 00:17:45,869
And again, this is a lot due to the late adopter syndrome.

363
00:17:45,869 --> 00:17:47,590
And we'll get more into that later.

364
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:52,346
So if we go back and we look at the gender, you know, returning to Who games, the ratio

365
00:17:52,346 --> 00:17:57,370
of male to female gamers has definitely changed over time and it bounces around a lot.

366
00:17:57,370 --> 00:18:02,053
And this is the ESA numbers, the EDAR numbers are very close, but you can see we've always

367
00:18:02,053 --> 00:18:05,975
kind of maintained about a 60-40 ratio and it creeps up a little bit and creeps back

368
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:10,058
down, but there have been more women playing games longer than most people think.

369
00:18:10,678 --> 00:18:12,699
This is also really impressive here,

370
00:18:12,699 --> 00:18:16,039
because with the quantity of new players coming into the market,

371
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,180
this could have been a radically different story.

372
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:21,740
This could have been only this age came into the market,

373
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:23,881
or only this gender came into the market.

374
00:18:23,881 --> 00:18:26,381
But we've seen it pretty much permeate the culture,

375
00:18:26,381 --> 00:18:28,702
going both wide and deep.

376
00:18:28,702 --> 00:18:30,962
And again, that points to a very healthy ecosystem

377
00:18:30,962 --> 00:18:35,203
of people who like games and are willing to come

378
00:18:35,203 --> 00:18:37,423
into the gaming ecosystem, and hopefully pay

379
00:18:37,423 --> 00:18:39,623
all of our salaries so we can go make more games.

380
00:18:40,774 --> 00:18:45,896
However, that being said, men and women tend to play on different pieces of hardware.

381
00:18:45,896 --> 00:18:51,038
Blue is boys, purple is girls, and you can see here on mobile there are more female gamers

382
00:18:51,038 --> 00:18:53,099
than there are male gamers, outnumbering.

383
00:18:53,099 --> 00:18:58,060
But you go up to handheld, a little more male, console more male, PC primarily.

384
00:18:58,060 --> 00:19:03,142
And this always shifts around a bit over time, but at this point, if you're looking, there

385
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:05,923
are more women on mobile and there are more men on PC.

386
00:19:08,429 --> 00:19:14,875
If you kind of look at the payer segments on this, so again, blue 14, gray 2015, yellow

387
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:18,939
2016, going into the female gamers on this.

388
00:19:18,939 --> 00:19:23,503
On the non-paying segment, they've remained pretty steady.

389
00:19:23,503 --> 00:19:24,764
Same on the payers.

390
00:19:24,764 --> 00:19:28,788
Last year, the women shot up to be 50% of the heavy payers.

391
00:19:28,788 --> 00:19:30,389
That's considered the whale category.

392
00:19:30,990 --> 00:19:32,612
And this was because for one of the first times

393
00:19:32,612 --> 00:19:35,215
with Kim Kardashian and a couple of other things,

394
00:19:35,215 --> 00:19:38,099
we actually saw dedicated offerings made

395
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:40,482
that started addressing pieces of the market

396
00:19:40,482 --> 00:19:42,405
that hadn't been significantly addressed

397
00:19:42,405 --> 00:19:44,387
and monetized before.

398
00:19:44,387 --> 00:19:48,112
However, the lowering, which I'll get into in a minute,

399
00:19:48,112 --> 00:19:48,172
is

400
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:51,995
due to the fact that, and actually I'll get into this more in another slide,

401
00:19:51,995 --> 00:19:57,218
we've seen an increase this year on the number of people who are kind of the top of the payer category

402
00:19:57,218 --> 00:20:00,340
moving just into the heavy payer category.

403
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,901
And those were primarily men.

404
00:20:01,901 --> 00:20:05,223
So while the women are still paying in the heavy category,

405
00:20:05,223 --> 00:20:09,485
this group of people who can have just moved over was primarily male,

406
00:20:09,485 --> 00:20:13,167
leaving a lot of the women at kind of the top of the payer category.

407
00:20:13,167 --> 00:20:15,488
And so that lowered percentage-wise.

408
00:20:16,641 --> 00:20:23,230
And so, that being said, we've seen that women like men will pay for the games they like.

409
00:20:23,230 --> 00:20:29,258
And this just means make games that people like or target specific groupings that people

410
00:20:29,258 --> 00:20:30,600
will like.

411
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,383
So a quick note on game nomenclature.

412
00:20:33,064 --> 00:20:37,168
A SKU, or a shopkeeping unit, is what you'd actually buy in a retail or a digital store.

413
00:20:37,168 --> 00:20:42,253
So that's Angry Birds HG, GTA Game of the Year edition, the Assassin's Creed Collector

414
00:20:42,253 --> 00:20:45,917
edition, Rock Band With or Without Instruments.

415
00:20:45,917 --> 00:20:47,979
And most games release multiple SKUs.

416
00:20:47,979 --> 00:20:51,182
You know, you want to put out your regular edition, your Game of the Year, or you want

417
00:20:51,182 --> 00:20:52,984
to put it out on different platforms.

418
00:20:53,705 --> 00:20:55,466
So if I say that something's a SKU,

419
00:20:55,466 --> 00:20:58,068
that means the individual game that came out.

420
00:20:58,068 --> 00:21:02,071
If I say, hey, this was Angry Birds on Apple,

421
00:21:02,071 --> 00:21:04,633
for the original one, that would have meant four games

422
00:21:04,633 --> 00:21:07,014
rolled into one if we're counting.

423
00:21:07,014 --> 00:21:08,696
And this is important because I'm gonna be

424
00:21:08,696 --> 00:21:10,497
showing counting numbers.

425
00:21:10,497 --> 00:21:12,739
If I say a distinct game like Angry Birds,

426
00:21:12,739 --> 00:21:16,561
that means Angry Birds on every platform it came out

427
00:21:16,561 --> 00:21:19,103
with every single SKU released all rolled into one,

428
00:21:19,103 --> 00:21:22,266
where the franchise would be Angry Birds.

429
00:21:22,926 --> 00:21:25,209
This, of course, doesn't count regionalization,

430
00:21:25,209 --> 00:21:28,032
which adds a whole bunch of different things to this.

431
00:21:28,032 --> 00:21:31,997
And this is, of course, why your accounting department hates you.

432
00:21:31,997 --> 00:21:34,320
So looking at games and game count,

433
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:36,082
we're going to be talking about platform

434
00:21:36,082 --> 00:21:38,164
for the next couple ones, which is, hey,

435
00:21:38,164 --> 00:21:40,727
if it came out on Apple and there were four SKUs,

436
00:21:40,727 --> 00:21:42,209
that only counts as one game.

437
00:21:43,081 --> 00:21:48,766
So looking at the number of games released for the past few years, we've been in the middle of a renaissance of game creation.

438
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:53,069
While the barriers to making a triple A or S tier game have arguably never been higher,

439
00:21:53,069 --> 00:21:57,132
the barriers for small teams to create games of quality have perhaps never been lower.

440
00:21:57,132 --> 00:22:05,138
So this is the quantity of retail console, handheld, and PC games released at a platform level.

441
00:22:05,138 --> 00:22:08,121
So all the SKUs rolled into one, and you can see that it's getting lower.

442
00:22:09,393 --> 00:22:13,095
And this is not something you'd expect, because I'm leaving out a huge thing here.

443
00:22:13,095 --> 00:22:17,397
So let me change this axis from 2000 up to 7000, and it looks like this.

444
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:23,240
And let's say instead of retail games, let's say retail and digital, console, handheld,

445
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:23,560
and PC.

446
00:22:23,560 --> 00:22:27,462
And at this point it looks something more like that.

447
00:22:27,462 --> 00:22:30,643
So yeah, that is a lot of games, and yes, we had...

448
00:22:31,263 --> 00:22:36,285
Almost 6,500 games come out last year just for console, PC, and handheld.

449
00:22:36,285 --> 00:22:40,707
And the question is, where are all these games coming from?

450
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:46,069
So in blue we have the seventh generation consoles, Xbox, 360, PS3, Wii.

451
00:22:46,069 --> 00:22:49,070
Gray is eighth gen, yellow is handheld, and red is PC.

452
00:22:49,070 --> 00:22:55,313
And yes, that is almost entirely Steam.

453
00:22:55,313 --> 00:22:58,074
There were about 5,000 games released on Steam last year.

454
00:22:59,654 --> 00:23:01,565
Here, let me break this out.

455
00:23:01,868 --> 00:23:04,229
This is what Steam has looked like.

456
00:23:04,229 --> 00:23:05,149
In 2014, there were 1,500 games.

457
00:23:05,149 --> 00:23:06,069
In 2015, there were 3,400.

458
00:23:06,069 --> 00:23:08,250
In 2016, 4,600 games released.

459
00:23:08,250 --> 00:23:11,131
More games came out on Steam last year

460
00:23:11,131 --> 00:23:16,052
than the entire physical and digital catalog

461
00:23:16,052 --> 00:23:20,553
of every seventh generation console,

462
00:23:20,553 --> 00:23:22,513
so the 360, the PS3, and the Wii,

463
00:23:22,513 --> 00:23:25,374
and eighth generation console,

464
00:23:25,374 --> 00:23:28,375
the Xbox One, the PS4, and the Wii U,

465
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:30,635
and all of the handheld, like the...

466
00:23:32,576 --> 00:23:34,697
Game Boy or, man, I can't even think today,

467
00:23:34,697 --> 00:23:37,359
the Vita and all of that put together.

468
00:23:37,359 --> 00:23:38,921
If you put all that together,

469
00:23:38,921 --> 00:23:40,982
more games came out on Steam last year

470
00:23:40,982 --> 00:23:42,783
than that entire catalog.

471
00:23:42,783 --> 00:23:45,585
And last year, so let's see,

472
00:23:45,585 --> 00:23:49,268
Steam, they announced about 15 years ago at GDC actually,

473
00:23:49,268 --> 00:23:50,669
over 150 million active users.

474
00:23:50,669 --> 00:23:52,831
Remember when I said it was hard to gauge

475
00:23:52,831 --> 00:23:54,692
a PC hardware install base?

476
00:23:54,692 --> 00:23:57,014
Well, if you assume that there's at least one PC

477
00:23:57,014 --> 00:23:58,495
for every Steam active user,

478
00:23:58,495 --> 00:24:01,297
you get at least 150 million active gaming PCs out there.

479
00:24:03,475 --> 00:24:04,996
So back to games released.

480
00:24:04,996 --> 00:24:08,279
So we also now have bite-sized gaming devices

481
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:09,941
in every pocket, which is great.

482
00:24:09,941 --> 00:24:12,683
And it is now socially acceptable to play a game

483
00:24:12,683 --> 00:24:14,065
just about anywhere, anytime.

484
00:24:14,065 --> 00:24:16,207
We have become a gaming culture.

485
00:24:16,207 --> 00:24:19,169
You know, when I was growing up, nobody played games in bars.

486
00:24:19,169 --> 00:24:20,551
Nobody played games in coffee shops.

487
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:22,753
You know, nobody played games on the bus.

488
00:24:22,753 --> 00:24:23,634
Well, maybe on the bus.

489
00:24:24,214 --> 00:24:28,899
But you know, there's obviously a tremendous amount of iPhone and Android games released every year.

490
00:24:28,899 --> 00:24:34,466
And I've shown in past years, we've talked about the Discovery problem, you know, there were more than a hundred thousand,

491
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,889
you know, just iOS games released in North America alone.

492
00:24:36,889 --> 00:24:42,815
That, however, is a very impractical number, because the majority of those games sell nothing.

493
00:24:43,456 --> 00:24:46,137
So the numbers I'm showing for the next chart

494
00:24:46,137 --> 00:24:49,058
are iOS and Android games that basically hit a top 50 chart,

495
00:24:49,058 --> 00:24:52,340
meaning that they had some chance of making revenue.

496
00:24:52,340 --> 00:24:55,501
So what we're going to look at now is if we say, OK,

497
00:24:55,501 --> 00:24:58,182
if we take the total release of everything that came out,

498
00:24:58,182 --> 00:24:59,523
what were the percentages?

499
00:24:59,523 --> 00:25:03,545
So this is on quantity of games added up against each other.

500
00:25:03,545 --> 00:25:06,846
7th Gen, which is sun setting, 1%.

501
00:25:06,846 --> 00:25:09,427
8th Gen, 15%, handheld, 2%.

502
00:25:09,427 --> 00:25:10,908
PC, 58% of the games released.

503
00:25:11,268 --> 00:25:13,129
And then you get iOS and Android at the 10 and 14.

504
00:25:13,129 --> 00:25:15,110
But again, those are only basically

505
00:25:15,110 --> 00:25:18,592
games that hit a top 50 of any of the charts

506
00:25:18,592 --> 00:25:20,513
during the entire year.

507
00:25:20,513 --> 00:25:22,554
So that is still a tremendous amount of games.

508
00:25:22,554 --> 00:25:24,035
And those are the ones that actually had, again,

509
00:25:24,035 --> 00:25:24,956
a chance of selling.

510
00:25:27,130 --> 00:25:30,593
So a point of fascination for me also on the shift between the seventh and eighth generation

511
00:25:30,593 --> 00:25:34,876
consoles has been going from physical to a fully integrated digital strategy.

512
00:25:34,876 --> 00:25:41,361
So blue is physical-only game releases, gray is digital-only releases, and yellow is games

513
00:25:41,361 --> 00:25:44,523
released both physically and digitally on a console.

514
00:25:45,204 --> 00:25:52,328
And as you can see, you can actually see here the peak of physical game releases and the constant rise of digitally released games.

515
00:25:52,328 --> 00:25:54,370
This kind of sums it up here.

516
00:25:54,370 --> 00:26:03,456
And at this point, unless your game on a console has a mandatory physical component or peripheral, it is pretty much always released digitally.

517
00:26:03,456 --> 00:26:07,939
There are no more physical-only released games of this type.

518
00:26:07,939 --> 00:26:12,402
You know, you can look at that tiny little blue bar at the bottom of 2016.

519
00:26:14,364 --> 00:26:16,925
Going along with some of the surprising bits on the trends,

520
00:26:16,925 --> 00:26:19,207
another one has been for console,

521
00:26:19,207 --> 00:26:23,970
the quantity of publishers, which is here shown in blue,

522
00:26:23,970 --> 00:26:26,692
has increased over the past decade.

523
00:26:26,692 --> 00:26:29,694
So blue is publishers, gray is games on console,

524
00:26:29,694 --> 00:26:31,835
and the yellow line is games per publisher.

525
00:26:32,636 --> 00:26:36,980
So this is surprising, I say, because there's been a massive consolidation in the mid and

526
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:38,121
the top-tier publisher ranks.

527
00:26:38,121 --> 00:26:43,286
You would expect to see therefore fewer publishers over time with the buyouts and acquisitions.

528
00:26:43,286 --> 00:26:47,970
The consolidation has been offset, however, by the rise of the digital-only games and

529
00:26:47,970 --> 00:26:50,372
the low barriers to entry for digital publishers.

530
00:26:51,556 --> 00:26:58,639
So you can again kind of see the quantity of games and going down and the yellow line is the average number of games released per publisher, which you can see has declined.

531
00:26:58,639 --> 00:27:05,623
And most publishers at this point are concentrating on fewer, better financed and better marketed titles.

532
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:08,731
You know, if we showed only the major publishers here,

533
00:27:08,731 --> 00:27:11,415
the difference would be significantly more pronounced.

534
00:27:11,415 --> 00:27:13,557
Gone are the days when a single large publisher

535
00:27:13,557 --> 00:27:15,820
would have a slate of, say, 20 plus premium games

536
00:27:15,820 --> 00:27:17,783
all coming out in one year.

537
00:27:17,783 --> 00:27:19,805
Again, the trend is less games per,

538
00:27:19,805 --> 00:27:21,547
but bigger development budgets

539
00:27:21,547 --> 00:27:22,729
and bigger marketing budgets.

540
00:27:24,537 --> 00:27:27,621
So video game sales, you know, so these are games,

541
00:27:27,621 --> 00:27:30,825
this isn't counting the hardware or the peripherals,

542
00:27:30,825 --> 00:27:35,151
as reported by NTPD is about a $16.5 billion a year industry

543
00:27:35,151 --> 00:27:35,732
just in the US.

544
00:27:35,732 --> 00:27:38,595
And there's acknowledgement that this is a little bit

545
00:27:38,595 --> 00:27:39,737
of an underreported number.

546
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:42,358
But this is really close.

547
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:45,379
And of course, the games are not the only thing

548
00:27:45,379 --> 00:27:46,459
in the ecosystem.

549
00:27:46,459 --> 00:27:49,520
We also do have the hardware and the accessories.

550
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:52,181
And together, it adds up to about $23.5 billion,

551
00:27:52,181 --> 00:27:53,141
again, just in the US.

552
00:27:53,141 --> 00:27:55,502
Mobile sales are also increasing.

553
00:27:55,502 --> 00:27:58,542
This year, we had about $6.1 billion

554
00:27:58,542 --> 00:28:01,183
of mobile sales in North America.

555
00:28:01,183 --> 00:28:03,364
And this makes up a larger percent of the market

556
00:28:03,364 --> 00:28:04,284
than ever before.

557
00:28:04,284 --> 00:28:07,065
About a third of the revenue is coming in from that.

558
00:28:08,707 --> 00:28:14,751
And across pretty much every region, mobile gamers tend to engage similarly with mobile games,

559
00:28:14,751 --> 00:28:20,315
with about half of the players spending nothing on games and a very small amount of them spending a lot.

560
00:28:21,162 --> 00:28:24,305
And this is pretty consistent year on year in North America.

561
00:28:24,305 --> 00:28:27,868
And we see this backing similar trends across Asia and Europe.

562
00:28:27,868 --> 00:28:29,009
So blue here is 2014.

563
00:28:29,009 --> 00:28:32,112
And this is the mobile gamer.

564
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:36,236
This is actually a number of active mobile gamers.

565
00:28:36,236 --> 00:28:36,976
Gray is 2015.

566
00:28:36,976 --> 00:28:37,377
Yellow is 2016.

567
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:40,540
And they're bucketed into the non-payers, payers,

568
00:28:40,540 --> 00:28:41,280
and heavy payers.

569
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,562
And a couple interesting patterns of note here.

570
00:28:44,183 --> 00:28:48,008
Much of the market growth is happening on the non-payer end, and this is again mostly

571
00:28:48,008 --> 00:28:51,212
tied to the late adopter, non-traditional gamers coming in.

572
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:58,021
And despite the smaller proportion, the payers still contribute very significantly to the

573
00:28:58,021 --> 00:28:58,321
revenue.

574
00:29:00,252 --> 00:29:09,046
We also see here that the average spend of payers and heavy payers is down from 2015,

575
00:29:09,046 --> 00:29:14,935
which is in the yellow, to 2016 in green, but the population has increased.

576
00:29:15,736 --> 00:29:21,380
So the total population of heavy payers actually went up, almost 50%, but the new heavy payers

577
00:29:21,380 --> 00:29:24,462
just edging their way in aren't the super whales.

578
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:29,886
These are guys who've moved from, say, spending 90 bucks a year to maybe 120 bucks a year,

579
00:29:29,886 --> 00:29:32,788
as opposed to the 500 to 1,000 bucks a year, kind of at the top.

580
00:29:32,788 --> 00:29:37,071
So more people are in the category, and this category is making more money in total, but

581
00:29:37,071 --> 00:29:42,074
there's less money per average one because some people kind of just moved up over the

582
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:42,375
line.

583
00:29:43,057 --> 00:29:47,512
So again, more people in total, generating a bit less on average, but more money for

584
00:29:47,512 --> 00:29:48,175
the category.

585
00:29:50,448 --> 00:29:53,090
When you look at monetizing, to kind of break it out again,

586
00:29:53,090 --> 00:29:56,311
just for percent of revenue, non-payers obviously bring

587
00:29:56,311 --> 00:29:59,673
in zero percent of the revenue because they are non-payers.

588
00:29:59,673 --> 00:30:04,875
The moderate payers bring in 41% of the revenue, or excuse me,

589
00:30:04,875 --> 00:30:07,176
45% of the revenue brought in by 41% of the population.

590
00:30:07,176 --> 00:30:10,357
And this is actually down.

591
00:30:10,357 --> 00:30:13,919
Last year, it was 45% of the ecosystem brought

592
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:14,579
in 50% of the revenue.

593
00:30:15,420 --> 00:30:19,381
And this year for the heavy payers, which last year were about 5% of the ecosystem,

594
00:30:19,381 --> 00:30:23,162
they're now 7% and we've gone from 50% to 55% of the revenue.

595
00:30:23,162 --> 00:30:29,685
So people are basically beginning to be okay with spending more money, or a larger percent

596
00:30:29,685 --> 00:30:35,047
of the population is okay spending more money in the mobile markets than ever before, which

597
00:30:35,047 --> 00:30:36,847
again is great for our ecosystem.

598
00:30:38,253 --> 00:30:42,835
There is a heavy overlap between people who play games a lot

599
00:30:42,835 --> 00:30:46,256
and people who pay for the games a lot.

600
00:30:46,256 --> 00:30:49,997
So on the left-hand side in purple, we have light payers,

601
00:30:49,997 --> 00:30:52,238
or we have player, players.

602
00:30:52,238 --> 00:30:54,479
In the top, the lightest one is light players,

603
00:30:54,479 --> 00:30:56,020
less than an hour a week,

604
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:57,800
going down to the middle of moderate players,

605
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,281
one to five hours a week,

606
00:30:59,281 --> 00:31:00,601
and heavy players for mobile.

607
00:31:00,601 --> 00:31:03,382
And again, this is only their mobile playing time

608
00:31:03,382 --> 00:31:04,523
of five hours plus a week.

609
00:31:04,523 --> 00:31:07,104
Across the top, you can see the non-payers at zero.

610
00:31:07,964 --> 00:31:10,986
the payers at 99 cents to 100 bucks a year,

611
00:31:10,986 --> 00:31:12,687
and the heavy payers at 100 plus.

612
00:31:12,687 --> 00:31:15,870
And you can kind of look at the heavy player amount,

613
00:31:15,870 --> 00:31:17,751
and you see that almost none of them

614
00:31:17,751 --> 00:31:19,852
are light amount of players.

615
00:31:19,852 --> 00:31:22,474
They all play for significant amounts of time,

616
00:31:22,474 --> 00:31:26,577
and the heaviest monetizing group plays for the longest.

617
00:31:26,577 --> 00:31:27,998
And again, this is very important

618
00:31:27,998 --> 00:31:29,619
as you're designing your game.

619
00:31:29,619 --> 00:31:32,041
People who play more tend to pay more.

620
00:31:33,890 --> 00:31:36,031
That being said, there's also still a difference by gender.

621
00:31:36,031 --> 00:31:37,572
And as usual, the men are the blue

622
00:31:37,572 --> 00:31:39,593
and the women are the purple.

623
00:31:39,593 --> 00:31:42,095
And if we look at the heavy players,

624
00:31:42,095 --> 00:31:44,237
there is close to gender parity.

625
00:31:44,237 --> 00:31:47,319
If we look at the heavy payers, because of the shift

626
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:50,261
from last year, men are now outnumbering the women again.

627
00:31:50,261 --> 00:31:53,523
And you can also kind of see the average age going along there.

628
00:31:55,539 --> 00:31:58,763
So cross-platform ownership is very high in Western markets.

629
00:31:58,763 --> 00:32:01,906
So this is looking at people who play games on phone

630
00:32:01,906 --> 00:32:04,069
and where else they play games.

631
00:32:04,069 --> 00:32:08,574
So if you look at the entire mobile gaming population

632
00:32:08,574 --> 00:32:11,037
of 18 plus, only 24% play games only on their phones.

633
00:32:11,477 --> 00:32:17,699
You get then the 24% for mobile PC, 30% for mobile PC and console, and 22% for mobile console.

634
00:32:17,699 --> 00:32:22,540
And a lot of the people that are mobile only are some of these late adopters who are just getting in

635
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,921
and basically didn't grow up playing games in other places,

636
00:32:25,921 --> 00:32:30,483
who then moved into cell phones and tablets because they were convenient for playing.

637
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:35,484
And again, almost all of the heavy...

638
00:32:35,484 --> 00:32:36,645
Why do I even have that note there?

639
00:32:37,808 --> 00:32:40,869
If you look at the PC market, it's actually very similar,

640
00:32:40,869 --> 00:32:42,389
although it's a little more skewed.

641
00:32:42,389 --> 00:32:45,610
And this is slightly older data, but again, non-payers just

642
00:32:45,610 --> 00:32:46,030
below 50%.

643
00:32:46,030 --> 00:32:49,491
You get the moderate payers, and you get the heavy payers.

644
00:32:49,491 --> 00:32:52,971
And on PC, the 99th percentile as a callout

645
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,532
accounts for 15% of the generated revenue.

646
00:32:55,532 --> 00:32:59,893
So there are even more super whales in PC, in some cases,

647
00:32:59,893 --> 00:33:00,893
than there are in mobile.

648
00:33:02,611 --> 00:33:06,413
PC revenue from the total monetization of the PC ecosystem

649
00:33:06,413 --> 00:33:10,896
has been steadily increasing over the past few years.

650
00:33:10,896 --> 00:33:13,378
So in blue, you see PC retail, or physical.

651
00:33:13,839 --> 00:33:17,343
In gray you see digital retail and in yellow you see free to play.

652
00:33:17,343 --> 00:33:22,107
And at this point physical PC is pretty much non-existent.

653
00:33:22,107 --> 00:33:25,771
PC has moved entirely into the digital ecosystem.

654
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:29,114
And you know a lot of this is spearheaded by outstanding titles like League of Legends

655
00:33:29,114 --> 00:33:31,957
and online stores like Steam. You saw the Steam numbers going up.

656
00:33:31,957 --> 00:33:35,380
But again a majority of the PC ecosystem is now digital.

657
00:33:37,110 --> 00:33:40,896
So part of this talk used to be, with all the talk on PC and mobile,

658
00:33:40,896 --> 00:33:42,779
why do I even still talk about console?

659
00:33:42,779 --> 00:33:46,465
And then I'd show you pictures of all of the billion dollar console games

660
00:33:46,465 --> 00:33:49,891
and say, because they generate a, and this is a technical term,

661
00:33:49,891 --> 00:33:51,193
metric fuck ton of money.

662
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:54,056
So I rearranged it this year for a new message.

663
00:33:54,056 --> 00:33:56,597
There's a lot of great ways to sell games.

664
00:33:56,597 --> 00:33:59,418
And some games cost significantly less to develop.

665
00:33:59,418 --> 00:34:01,778
And some games provide enough of an experience

666
00:34:01,778 --> 00:34:03,959
that people will pay $60 up front for them.

667
00:34:03,959 --> 00:34:05,479
But it's not just consoles.

668
00:34:05,479 --> 00:34:08,360
If you have a widely adopted hardware platform,

669
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,060
i.e. audience, people will figure out

670
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:12,560
how to sell to that audience.

671
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,801
And this is why Apple and Android do so well.

672
00:34:14,801 --> 00:34:17,021
They have a widely adopted hardware platform.

673
00:34:17,802 --> 00:34:20,583
And a great game with a strong consumer value proposition

674
00:34:20,583 --> 00:34:22,885
and the correct monetization method

675
00:34:22,885 --> 00:34:26,147
can do very well on mobile, tablet, PC, console.

676
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:29,489
So we have billion-dollar HD games, console and PC,

677
00:34:29,489 --> 00:34:33,872
that are both premium and free-to-play,

678
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,753
and billion-dollar free-to-play mobile games.

679
00:34:35,753 --> 00:34:37,594
What we haven't seen yet

680
00:34:37,594 --> 00:34:40,456
is a billion-dollar premium mobile title.

681
00:34:40,456 --> 00:34:43,358
You can see one of the areas of that square is empty.

682
00:34:44,644 --> 00:34:46,125
So as a publisher or developer, when

683
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,446
you're looking at the game industry,

684
00:34:47,446 --> 00:34:50,008
it's very, very easy to become myopic and focus only

685
00:34:50,008 --> 00:34:52,170
on what you and your team is doing,

686
00:34:52,170 --> 00:34:53,431
or the region you're doing it in,

687
00:34:53,431 --> 00:34:54,552
or the customers you're selling to.

688
00:34:54,552 --> 00:34:57,234
But the game industry has a tremendous ability

689
00:34:57,234 --> 00:34:59,476
to scale to new hardware, to new features,

690
00:34:59,476 --> 00:35:02,799
to new business models, and rarely do the old ones

691
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:05,321
die off as quickly as predicted, or in some cases,

692
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:06,162
die off at all.

693
00:35:06,662 --> 00:35:10,084
I can't tell you the number of times I've heard mobile is dead in my 21 years in the

694
00:35:10,084 --> 00:35:15,746
industry, or PC is dead, or console is dead, or hey wait, now everything is PC, or everything

695
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,187
is console, or everything is subscription, or everything is free to play.

696
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:18,427
No.

697
00:35:18,427 --> 00:35:22,529
Everything just keeps going and expanding out, which again is great for the market.

698
00:35:22,529 --> 00:35:25,951
It means we get to all keep making things and hopefully get a paycheck.

699
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:31,394
So speaking of dying off, many people are wondering when retail games will die off.

700
00:35:31,394 --> 00:35:33,355
And the answer is actually not very soon.

701
00:35:33,355 --> 00:35:39,940
So this is the revenue split of games released simultaneously in physical and digital formats

702
00:35:39,940 --> 00:35:41,521
on basically core consoles.

703
00:35:42,261 --> 00:35:49,265
And this graph, so you can see in 2016, 75% of the revenue of these games came in from physical sales.

704
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:55,269
This might have been a physical sale ordered digitally, buying it off Amazon,

705
00:35:55,269 --> 00:36:01,172
but this is buying a copy that you could stick in to your device.

706
00:36:01,172 --> 00:36:01,973
25% digital sales.

707
00:36:01,973 --> 00:36:06,615
And this has grown significantly from 2005 when 97% was physical and 3% were digital.

708
00:36:06,615 --> 00:36:09,497
But it's still much less than most people believe.

709
00:36:09,997 --> 00:36:14,120
and has the potential, actually, not to increase dramatically

710
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:14,780
anytime soon.

711
00:36:14,780 --> 00:36:16,701
And let me tell you three reasons why.

712
00:36:16,701 --> 00:36:20,043
A, these are big games, a lot of them.

713
00:36:20,043 --> 00:36:22,245
And the internet infrastructure in North America

714
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:23,706
is not amazing.

715
00:36:23,706 --> 00:36:26,648
If you want to be a digital consumer,

716
00:36:26,648 --> 00:36:29,289
you need a very strong digital backbone

717
00:36:29,289 --> 00:36:30,750
going across the country and the ability

718
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:31,971
to get these games quickly.

719
00:36:32,873 --> 00:36:35,796
Number two is digital gifting is still really hard.

720
00:36:35,796 --> 00:36:38,018
If my mom wants to give me a game on the Xbox,

721
00:36:38,018 --> 00:36:41,441
or my wife wants to give me a game on the PlayStation,

722
00:36:41,441 --> 00:36:42,742
or anything like that,

723
00:36:42,742 --> 00:36:44,984
or I wanna go to my friend's bachelor party

724
00:36:44,984 --> 00:36:46,326
and give him a game,

725
00:36:46,326 --> 00:36:47,867
this is still a very hard thing to do.

726
00:36:47,867 --> 00:36:49,729
And until we can reduce the friction

727
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:53,872
and make it super easy for basically non-traditional gamers

728
00:36:53,872 --> 00:36:55,154
to gift as gaming,

729
00:36:55,154 --> 00:36:57,596
there is still a lot of games that get bought as gifts.

730
00:36:57,856 --> 00:36:59,597
Number three, a lot of these kind of gamers

731
00:36:59,597 --> 00:37:01,977
like to sell their games back, and they can't

732
00:37:01,977 --> 00:37:03,418
do that with digital copies.

733
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:05,299
And so that also is preventing this

734
00:37:05,299 --> 00:37:07,139
from getting more integrated.

735
00:37:07,139 --> 00:37:11,181
That being said, if you look at total digital sales, which

736
00:37:11,181 --> 00:37:13,462
we see in blue, they have at this point

737
00:37:13,462 --> 00:37:16,223
past total physical sales, which we see in gray.

738
00:37:16,223 --> 00:37:18,144
And for this measurement, digital sales

739
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:21,625
include digital game sales, subscriptions, DLC, mobile apps,

740
00:37:21,625 --> 00:37:23,746
and social network gaming, so kind

741
00:37:23,746 --> 00:37:25,867
of the entire ecosystem of it.

742
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:31,320
So a few slides ago, I showed how the quantity of games

743
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,183
per publisher was decreasing, and more publishers

744
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:36,004
were looking to invest more significantly,

745
00:37:36,004 --> 00:37:37,946
both in development and marketing budgets,

746
00:37:37,946 --> 00:37:39,747
on the games they released.

747
00:37:39,747 --> 00:37:41,228
And this has actually reversed some

748
00:37:41,228 --> 00:37:42,389
of the market consolidation trends

749
00:37:42,389 --> 00:37:44,651
we saw over the past few years.

750
00:37:44,651 --> 00:37:46,893
But the top games still disproportionately

751
00:37:46,893 --> 00:37:48,654
outperformed the more modest games.

752
00:37:49,291 --> 00:37:52,433
What we're looking at here is physical and digital consoles.

753
00:37:52,433 --> 00:37:57,355
So yellow is the percent of revenue for all of the sales

754
00:37:57,355 --> 00:38:00,137
generated by the top 2% of the games.

755
00:38:00,137 --> 00:38:03,138
Gray is the top 10%, and blue is the top 50%.

756
00:38:03,138 --> 00:38:06,480
So the top 50% of the games bring in about 99%

757
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:07,981
of the revenue.

758
00:38:07,981 --> 00:38:09,741
And you can see the top 10% of the games

759
00:38:09,741 --> 00:38:12,983
are bringing in right around 65% of the revenue.

760
00:38:12,983 --> 00:38:16,525
And the top 2% are bringing in just under 30% of the revenue.

761
00:38:17,660 --> 00:38:20,501
And this is actually a little better than it used to be.

762
00:38:20,501 --> 00:38:22,422
And the categories are moving up again

763
00:38:22,422 --> 00:38:24,183
because people are putting more money,

764
00:38:24,183 --> 00:38:27,325
or the bigger publishers, more money, fewer titles,

765
00:38:27,325 --> 00:38:30,326
which means there are more titles than just the top 2%

766
00:38:30,326 --> 00:38:30,806
now.

767
00:38:30,806 --> 00:38:32,687
You can kind of see that little dip in there.

768
00:38:32,687 --> 00:38:37,570
Going along with that, the average, whoops, hold on.

769
00:38:37,570 --> 00:38:38,530
Did I skip a slide?

770
00:38:40,372 --> 00:38:40,972
There we go.

771
00:38:40,972 --> 00:38:41,953
I did it.

772
00:38:41,953 --> 00:38:44,854
So looking at eighth generation retail console, 12%

773
00:38:44,854 --> 00:38:49,157
of the titles have at this point generated 75% of the revenue

774
00:38:49,157 --> 00:38:49,437
since 2012.

775
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:51,839
And this is actually up from 2008 to 2014

776
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:55,661
when it was 8% of the titles generating 75% of the revenue.

777
00:38:55,661 --> 00:39:00,284
So again, more people investing more money in marketing

778
00:39:00,284 --> 00:39:01,285
in these kinds of games.

779
00:39:01,285 --> 00:39:03,547
In a lot of cases, this really is.

780
00:39:03,547 --> 00:39:07,809
The middle on the retail market is disappearing.

781
00:39:07,809 --> 00:39:10,251
We're basically pushing up and we're pushing down.

782
00:39:11,997 --> 00:39:17,002
Kind of going along with that, the average quality, though, has remained fairly consistent.

783
00:39:17,002 --> 00:39:18,844
We haven't seen big spikes.

784
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:25,310
That dip, by the way, in 2007 and 6 was the Wii, when basically there was so much shovelware

785
00:39:25,310 --> 00:39:29,955
that got shoved onto the Wii that it lowered the entire review score average of the industry

786
00:39:29,955 --> 00:39:31,416
by a couple of percentage points.

787
00:39:33,612 --> 00:39:35,733
It was, yeah, surprising to everybody.

788
00:39:35,733 --> 00:39:40,196
This, by the way, the 70 number is about 10 points

789
00:39:40,196 --> 00:39:41,716
under the magic number you want.

790
00:39:41,716 --> 00:39:43,417
80 is the new 90.

791
00:39:43,417 --> 00:39:46,739
80 basically is the point where people

792
00:39:46,739 --> 00:39:48,900
will buy DLC for your game, or they'll

793
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,201
buy expansions, et cetera.

794
00:39:50,201 --> 00:39:52,442
80 is kind of the cutoff in consumers

795
00:39:52,442 --> 00:39:55,843
at this point for the good enough game.

796
00:39:55,843 --> 00:39:57,905
And it really comes down to people

797
00:39:57,905 --> 00:40:00,106
don't buy more of a game that they don't like.

798
00:40:00,746 --> 00:40:02,991
And if you're kind of looking for your quality bar, it's 80.

799
00:40:02,991 --> 00:40:04,554
That's where you want to be.

800
00:40:04,554 --> 00:40:06,317
So 10 points over the industry average.

801
00:40:11,446 --> 00:40:14,528
There's just variants every year, honestly.

802
00:40:14,528 --> 00:40:17,210
You know, there's, you get a couple titles

803
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:19,612
that do particularly well or particularly poorly.

804
00:40:19,612 --> 00:40:21,473
But, oh, sorry, the question was,

805
00:40:21,473 --> 00:40:25,956
what do I attribute the slight drop in?

806
00:40:25,956 --> 00:40:28,318
And again, it's just, it's seasonal and yearly variants.

807
00:40:28,318 --> 00:40:30,359
There wasn't like all the games this year sucked

808
00:40:30,359 --> 00:40:31,400
or they were all better.

809
00:40:32,752 --> 00:40:35,712
One of the interesting things kind of going along with that

810
00:40:35,712 --> 00:40:39,333
is the quantity of games receiving a review score.

811
00:40:39,333 --> 00:40:44,295
So this is total count of retail and digital console games

812
00:40:44,295 --> 00:40:45,635
getting a review score in also buckets.

813
00:40:45,635 --> 00:40:48,396
Blue is less than 60, gray is the 60s, yellow 70s,

814
00:40:48,396 --> 00:40:52,017
red 80s, and purple 90s for review scores received.

815
00:40:52,017 --> 00:40:56,598
And you can see, there was that kind of dip

816
00:40:56,598 --> 00:40:58,299
for a couple of years.

817
00:40:58,299 --> 00:41:01,080
And that coincided kind of with the initial boom in mobile.

818
00:41:01,732 --> 00:41:04,053
when there were a lot more people kind of looking at that.

819
00:41:04,053 --> 00:41:05,974
But it has gone back up.

820
00:41:05,974 --> 00:41:09,956
And what is interesting, though, is

821
00:41:09,956 --> 00:41:13,597
remember that quantity of game graph I showed you,

822
00:41:13,597 --> 00:41:14,858
how many more games are coming out.

823
00:41:15,887 --> 00:41:19,708
And so this is actually the percent of games on consoles

824
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:21,569
that come out without a review score.

825
00:41:21,569 --> 00:41:24,270
And that doesn't mean nobody reviewed it.

826
00:41:24,270 --> 00:41:26,511
We count our review scores kind of like Metacritic and Game

827
00:41:26,511 --> 00:41:30,232
Rankings, where it has to get at least a couple from basically

828
00:41:30,232 --> 00:41:33,353
sites of above a certain, I'll just say, reputation.

829
00:41:33,353 --> 00:41:35,734
So these aren't individual blogs.

830
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:38,555
But if you look at digital only games,

831
00:41:38,555 --> 00:41:41,615
we're still averaging just under half of them

832
00:41:41,615 --> 00:41:42,656
get no review score.

833
00:41:42,656 --> 00:41:44,817
And again, this is just the quantity that come out.

834
00:41:45,790 --> 00:41:52,791
where the reviewers aren't obviously reviewing as many of the physical edition games as they used to.

835
00:41:52,791 --> 00:41:55,172
You know, it used to be only 3% didn't get a review.

836
00:41:55,172 --> 00:41:55,732
In 2016, we're up to 22%,

837
00:41:55,732 --> 00:42:01,593
but they're doing a pretty good job keeping up, again, considering just the fire hose of games

838
00:42:01,593 --> 00:42:05,454
that are now coming out and they're having to keep up with.

839
00:42:05,454 --> 00:42:09,695
So, kind of going along with reviews and review scores.

840
00:42:11,487 --> 00:42:13,388
Advertising matters.

841
00:42:13,388 --> 00:42:17,010
There's a lot of development teams that think if you make a good game, people will come

842
00:42:17,010 --> 00:42:17,791
and buy it.

843
00:42:17,791 --> 00:42:20,532
And as a developer, I used to think that, and I don't anymore.

844
00:42:20,532 --> 00:42:25,035
So without good marketing, your game may do well, but it will never do as well as it could

845
00:42:25,035 --> 00:42:27,436
have, and usually substantially less.

846
00:42:27,436 --> 00:42:29,217
So I've put two factors up on the screen.

847
00:42:29,998 --> 00:42:31,839
A market spend and review score.

848
00:42:31,839 --> 00:42:34,560
So in this case, we're going to proxy review score

849
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:37,180
as a shorthand for game quality and polish.

850
00:42:37,180 --> 00:42:39,761
And if you wonder why, you can look at my past GDC talks,

851
00:42:39,761 --> 00:42:41,262
but there is a direct correlation

852
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:43,783
between review score and unit sales,

853
00:42:43,783 --> 00:42:45,183
and it's a hockey stick curve.

854
00:42:45,183 --> 00:42:46,884
Higher your score, the more you get.

855
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,202
So you can look it up in the vault.

856
00:42:50,202 --> 00:42:51,862
This is a little bit updated methodology

857
00:42:51,862 --> 00:42:53,063
since I last showed it.

858
00:42:53,063 --> 00:42:55,625
This is showing eighth gen console, first three

859
00:42:55,625 --> 00:42:58,186
months of revenue, which is when a majority of it comes in.

860
00:42:58,186 --> 00:43:00,947
But this holds true across pretty much every platform,

861
00:43:00,947 --> 00:43:02,588
every hardware, every type of game.

862
00:43:02,588 --> 00:43:05,730
So what we have here is on the bottom is review score.

863
00:43:05,730 --> 00:43:07,271
And we put them into buckets.

864
00:43:07,552 --> 00:43:11,139
bottom third of review scores, middle third, and top third.

865
00:43:11,139 --> 00:43:13,463
And on the left, on the yellow, going up and down,

866
00:43:13,463 --> 00:43:14,845
the bottom third of market spend,

867
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,127
the middle third, and the top third.

868
00:43:16,127 --> 00:43:18,591
So if we take out the middle buckets,

869
00:43:18,591 --> 00:43:21,316
we're left with, hey, bottom review.

870
00:43:22,071 --> 00:43:24,672
bottom marketing, which is where you don't want to be,

871
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:26,853
and top third and top third.

872
00:43:26,853 --> 00:43:28,054
So if you look at the unit sales,

873
00:43:28,054 --> 00:43:31,616
you can see there is a huge difference

874
00:43:31,616 --> 00:43:34,977
between the bottom and the top, or the bottom thirds,

875
00:43:34,977 --> 00:43:36,938
bottom thirds, top third, top thirds.

876
00:43:36,938 --> 00:43:40,180
You know, on average, the bottom bottom

877
00:43:40,180 --> 00:43:42,981
brought in 6% of the first three month revenue

878
00:43:42,981 --> 00:43:44,862
of what the top group did.

879
00:43:44,862 --> 00:43:46,543
But this then leaves the question.

880
00:43:47,043 --> 00:43:49,725
If you had to choose between your game getting, you know,

881
00:43:49,725 --> 00:43:52,287
top third review scores and bottom marketing,

882
00:43:52,287 --> 00:43:54,708
or top third marketing and bottom third review scores,

883
00:43:54,708 --> 00:43:56,129
which would you do better with?

884
00:43:56,129 --> 00:43:59,572
And the answer is you would do about twice as well

885
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:00,492
with good marketing.

886
00:44:00,492 --> 00:44:03,214
And this, again, goes back to that quantity

887
00:44:03,214 --> 00:44:04,195
of games coming out.

888
00:44:04,195 --> 00:44:07,197
There are so many games coming out

889
00:44:07,197 --> 00:44:08,838
that if you don't have marketing,

890
00:44:08,838 --> 00:44:10,159
nobody hears about your game,

891
00:44:10,159 --> 00:44:11,560
which means that nobody buys it.

892
00:44:12,260 --> 00:44:15,944
And this doesn't mean you have to go out and do traditional marketing, though that helps.

893
00:44:15,944 --> 00:44:18,946
What this means is people have to have a way of discovering your game.

894
00:44:18,946 --> 00:44:22,329
And one of the ways you do that is through marketing.

895
00:44:22,329 --> 00:44:27,134
And you know, you can always bet on going viral, but that's a bad bet to bet your entire

896
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:27,995
game's success on.

897
00:44:29,575 --> 00:44:33,057
So if you look at direct media spend, at this point,

898
00:44:33,057 --> 00:44:35,057
9% of the retail titles account for about 75%

899
00:44:35,057 --> 00:44:37,558
of the direct media marketing since 2012.

900
00:44:37,558 --> 00:44:40,599
And this was actually the exact same percentage as last year

901
00:44:40,599 --> 00:44:43,260
and down from the year before, where it was 13%.

902
00:44:43,260 --> 00:44:47,362
This is, however, much higher than in the 2008 to 2014,

903
00:44:47,362 --> 00:44:49,923
where only 6% of the titles accounted for this.

904
00:44:49,923 --> 00:44:54,284
So again, publishers, less games per publisher,

905
00:44:54,284 --> 00:44:58,066
more marketing spend, more development spend on it.

906
00:45:00,453 --> 00:45:02,975
So switching back over to mobile for a bit,

907
00:45:02,975 --> 00:45:05,015
so if you compare across regions,

908
00:45:05,015 --> 00:45:06,976
we see that mobile gamers are largely

909
00:45:06,976 --> 00:45:08,497
playing for many of the same reasons.

910
00:45:08,497 --> 00:45:11,618
And these tend to revolve around two key themes, accessibility

911
00:45:11,618 --> 00:45:12,919
and convenience.

912
00:45:12,919 --> 00:45:15,160
And this ties back to the mobile gaming experiences that

913
00:45:15,160 --> 00:45:16,200
have been successful.

914
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:19,102
Those that require a very limited attention span

915
00:45:19,102 --> 00:45:21,042
and time to play can be played and fit

916
00:45:21,042 --> 00:45:22,703
into a variety of circumstances.

917
00:45:23,483 --> 00:45:25,384
And in many ways at this point, we feel that mobile's

918
00:45:25,384 --> 00:45:27,964
kind of found its niche as an experience that fits

919
00:45:27,964 --> 00:45:30,265
into a network of other gaming experiences

920
00:45:30,265 --> 00:45:31,605
and is most successful when it aligns

921
00:45:31,605 --> 00:45:34,006
with these gamer expectations of bite-sized

922
00:45:34,006 --> 00:45:36,366
gaming experiences, rather than trying to shoehorn

923
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:39,067
a more core experience that would be better suited

924
00:45:39,067 --> 00:45:40,727
for other hardware or other platforms.

925
00:45:40,727 --> 00:45:44,828
And these motivations tend to be very different

926
00:45:44,828 --> 00:45:48,189
from PC console motivations, which honestly tend to focus

927
00:45:48,189 --> 00:45:50,609
more on entertainment factors and less on convenience,

928
00:45:50,609 --> 00:45:51,870
session length, and portability.

929
00:45:53,278 --> 00:45:55,359
So discovery is how people find out about a game.

930
00:45:55,359 --> 00:45:57,080
This is a combination of promotion,

931
00:45:57,080 --> 00:45:59,540
and traditional marketing, and PR, and cross-platform,

932
00:45:59,540 --> 00:46:01,461
and incentivized installs, and internet marketing,

933
00:46:01,461 --> 00:46:04,121
and editorial coverage, and social media, and views,

934
00:46:04,121 --> 00:46:04,942
and buzz, and viral.

935
00:46:04,942 --> 00:46:07,923
How do people hear about your game?

936
00:46:07,923 --> 00:46:10,423
And again, if you look at the quantity of games coming out,

937
00:46:10,423 --> 00:46:12,304
discovery is a huge thing.

938
00:46:12,304 --> 00:46:13,364
It's vital to every game.

939
00:46:13,364 --> 00:46:16,085
And over the past few years, consumers

940
00:46:16,085 --> 00:46:19,726
have become a lot more passive in their sources of discovery

941
00:46:19,726 --> 00:46:22,007
and much less active on the storefront.

942
00:46:23,408 --> 00:46:27,452
you know, ads are playing a key role in the past of discovery, but notably only when they're

943
00:46:27,452 --> 00:46:31,936
being consumed on the mobile devices themselves, you know, as with social media or ads for

944
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:32,577
other game apps.

945
00:46:32,577 --> 00:46:36,080
And, you know, there is a disconnect, if you have a disconnect between the consumption

946
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:41,005
of the ad and the actual process of downloading the game, say with like printer TV, it does

947
00:46:41,005 --> 00:46:44,348
undercut the effectiveness of the ad as a discovery tool.

948
00:46:45,034 --> 00:46:49,437
Mobile gamers are also showing a clear preference for more direct social recommendations.

949
00:46:49,437 --> 00:46:51,658
Again, allowing for kind of the more passive discovery.

950
00:46:51,658 --> 00:46:57,181
And again, this makes a great deal of sense as the players are finding the combined elements of an overcrowded market

951
00:46:57,181 --> 00:47:00,323
with iterative experiences intimidating,

952
00:47:00,323 --> 00:47:03,525
and we're also not seeing a lot of movement kind of in the top of the charts.

953
00:47:03,525 --> 00:47:05,987
And so a lot of these performers, people have already decided,

954
00:47:05,987 --> 00:47:07,848
am I going to play that game or not?

955
00:47:07,848 --> 00:47:10,590
And that makes it kind of interesting finding good options.

956
00:47:11,598 --> 00:47:16,841
So engagement are basically the different reasons people decide to actually acquire

957
00:47:16,841 --> 00:47:18,622
the game or engage with it.

958
00:47:18,622 --> 00:47:23,044
And on the whole, players for mobile emphasize quick indicators of suitability and quality

959
00:47:23,044 --> 00:47:23,905
when deciding to play.

960
00:47:23,905 --> 00:47:28,587
And consistent with the past couple years, price and genre continue to be the single

961
00:47:28,587 --> 00:47:31,068
most critical elements in making a download or play decision.

962
00:47:31,848 --> 00:47:34,709
You know, this basically suggests that players look to see,

963
00:47:34,709 --> 00:47:37,930
is this a business model that fits with the kind of game they're looking to play?

964
00:47:37,930 --> 00:47:40,730
And, you know, free downloads are particularly attractive across some genres,

965
00:47:40,730 --> 00:47:44,291
and premium models, you know, being justified on others.

966
00:47:44,291 --> 00:47:46,092
And the same for genre.

967
00:47:46,092 --> 00:47:48,452
If a game isn't the type of game you like to play,

968
00:47:48,452 --> 00:47:50,573
there's very little chance of you engaging with it.

969
00:47:50,573 --> 00:47:52,433
You know, I don't really like racing games.

970
00:47:52,433 --> 00:47:54,274
No matter how awesome the racing game is,

971
00:47:54,274 --> 00:47:56,434
I'm probably not going to download it, even if it's free,

972
00:47:56,434 --> 00:47:59,435
because that's not the kind of game I play.

973
00:47:59,435 --> 00:48:01,695
With this vast amount coming out of the games, I could be...

974
00:48:01,775 --> 00:48:06,759
playing. And although social sources are critical to learning about new games,

975
00:48:06,759 --> 00:48:10,882
they do play somewhat less of a role in actually deciding to play or, you know,

976
00:48:10,882 --> 00:48:15,306
engage with the game. You know, other indicators are much of quality or a much

977
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:19,649
bigger role. And players basically also prefer to know that the masses enjoy a

978
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:24,393
game rather than a specific person. So, adds on the everybody likes this and is

979
00:48:24,393 --> 00:48:27,955
playing it, once your friend has told you about it is actually more suitable than

980
00:48:27,955 --> 00:48:29,317
my friend Bob likes this game.

981
00:48:30,604 --> 00:48:32,525
So churn, or players leaving the game,

982
00:48:32,525 --> 00:48:35,326
is of course very important to the lifetime value of a user.

983
00:48:35,326 --> 00:48:39,088
And a key factor across all regions is loss of interest.

984
00:48:39,088 --> 00:48:41,609
Players churn because of lack of compelling metagame.

985
00:48:41,609 --> 00:48:43,510
This is followed closely by friction,

986
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:46,551
both on required spending and on game progress.

987
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:50,898
And as always remember, there are plenty of really good games out there.

988
00:48:50,898 --> 00:48:55,564
And if a player perceives that the game they are playing is not as good as other games out there,

989
00:48:55,564 --> 00:48:58,909
they might leave for a perceived better experience.

990
00:48:58,909 --> 00:49:01,393
So perception in your game is very important.

991
00:49:03,783 --> 00:49:07,365
So what we're looking at here is mobile genre revenue year

992
00:49:07,365 --> 00:49:12,746
on year by revenue change, with green being increases in revenue

993
00:49:12,746 --> 00:49:16,068
and red being decreases in revenue for mobile genres.

994
00:49:16,068 --> 00:49:19,028
And tying this into kind of a general pattern

995
00:49:19,028 --> 00:49:21,449
towards mobile market stabilization,

996
00:49:21,449 --> 00:49:23,670
mobile game players, again, accessibility and convenience.

997
00:49:23,670 --> 00:49:25,291
And we're seeing the strongest growth

998
00:49:25,291 --> 00:49:27,031
among those types of experiences, which

999
00:49:27,031 --> 00:49:29,372
has done the best job of embracing and implementing

1000
00:49:29,372 --> 00:49:30,252
these features.

1001
00:49:31,402 --> 00:49:36,048
Also, especially evident in this year is the power of brand.

1002
00:49:36,048 --> 00:49:40,214
Clash Royale and Pokemon Go both drove massive growth in their respective sub-genres.

1003
00:49:40,214 --> 00:49:45,521
Let me actually expand this chart out to show the full growth that Clash Royale brought

1004
00:49:45,521 --> 00:49:47,023
to the RTS tower defense sub-genre.

1005
00:49:49,090 --> 00:49:54,075
Also impressive is that combat city builders, such as class of clans, remained flat considering

1006
00:49:54,075 --> 00:49:56,017
their massive growth over the past year or two.

1007
00:49:56,017 --> 00:49:58,960
We haven't seen the decline in that.

1008
00:49:58,960 --> 00:50:06,548
Also of note for the ones doing well is looking at how carefully they navigate the Western

1009
00:50:06,548 --> 00:50:09,251
pay-to-win stigma on how they do their monetization.

1010
00:50:10,541 --> 00:50:12,242
So if we look at the top growers,

1011
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:14,703
those that have been doing an especially good job

1012
00:50:14,703 --> 00:50:17,225
of aligning their business models with gameplay,

1013
00:50:17,225 --> 00:50:19,206
noting what should appeal broadly or deeply,

1014
00:50:19,206 --> 00:50:21,707
and generating compelling core content loops

1015
00:50:21,707 --> 00:50:24,869
that keep gamers coming back for daily check-ins,

1016
00:50:24,869 --> 00:50:26,550
kind of evolving and adding in over time,

1017
00:50:26,550 --> 00:50:28,471
those are the ones that have been doing

1018
00:50:28,471 --> 00:50:29,592
really well this year.

1019
00:50:29,592 --> 00:50:32,213
The ones that have decreased the most

1020
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:33,914
are the ones that have struggled to innovate

1021
00:50:33,914 --> 00:50:36,255
or honestly to make their gameplay mobile-friendly

1022
00:50:36,255 --> 00:50:38,397
or to implement free-to-play well.

1023
00:50:41,332 --> 00:50:44,234
And while there is a Western pay-to-win stigma,

1024
00:50:44,234 --> 00:50:46,235
Western players are OK with spending money

1025
00:50:46,235 --> 00:50:48,857
to progress more quickly.

1026
00:50:48,857 --> 00:50:51,379
So this was a survey on when are you

1027
00:50:51,379 --> 00:50:55,782
most likely to consider spending money on a mobile game,

1028
00:50:55,782 --> 00:50:58,584
and surveyed thousands of people.

1029
00:50:58,584 --> 00:51:00,925
So other top factors include accessing

1030
00:51:00,925 --> 00:51:02,426
new content and experiences.

1031
00:51:03,007 --> 00:51:04,388
things on sale or discount,

1032
00:51:04,388 --> 00:51:06,230
and the ability to be more competitive.

1033
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:07,872
And again, it's that fine line

1034
00:51:07,872 --> 00:51:09,954
between more competitive and play to win

1035
00:51:09,954 --> 00:51:13,138
that you have to tiptoe carefully to avoid the stigma

1036
00:51:13,138 --> 00:51:15,320
while still being able to monetize on top of that.

1037
00:51:17,191 --> 00:51:23,860
Another interesting thing to note is that these are, by the way, let me start that again.

1038
00:51:23,860 --> 00:51:29,949
Another interesting thing is that these are the top genres that people say they play,

1039
00:51:29,949 --> 00:51:33,654
not pay, and that these are not necessarily the top grossing ones.

1040
00:51:34,655 --> 00:51:37,277
So these survey results came from a question

1041
00:51:37,277 --> 00:51:42,140
to identify your top five most actively played genres

1042
00:51:42,140 --> 00:51:43,521
on mobile for the past six months.

1043
00:51:43,521 --> 00:51:47,864
And so while most people played a wide variety of genres,

1044
00:51:47,864 --> 00:51:50,506
they did not necessarily monetize

1045
00:51:50,506 --> 00:51:54,148
on this wide variety of genres, with one exception here, slots.

1046
00:51:54,148 --> 00:51:56,370
And while slots didn't necessarily

1047
00:51:56,370 --> 00:51:59,792
tend to top most of the monthly charts, in aggregate,

1048
00:51:59,792 --> 00:52:02,073
they were very widely played.

1049
00:52:02,234 --> 00:52:05,623
You know, this was another big growth genre, which was slots.

1050
00:52:05,623 --> 00:52:08,792
And now, my yearly Kickstarter update.

1051
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,223
So Kickstarter is probably the most well-known

1052
00:52:12,223 --> 00:52:13,324
of the crowdfunding sites.

1053
00:52:13,324 --> 00:52:15,646
It's become a thing over the past few years.

1054
00:52:15,646 --> 00:52:17,748
And it gives small studios a way out

1055
00:52:17,748 --> 00:52:21,832
of relying exclusively on big publishers, the indie movement,

1056
00:52:21,832 --> 00:52:23,373
crowdfunding, finance.

1057
00:52:23,373 --> 00:52:26,256
So Kickstarter at this point has had $2.85 billion

1058
00:52:26,256 --> 00:52:28,939
pledged since inception, with almost $600 million

1059
00:52:28,939 --> 00:52:33,163
going to the game category on over 29,000 game projects.

1060
00:52:33,623 --> 00:52:37,265
You know, it is an interesting proposition, and it's no secret that most developers usually

1061
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:40,326
ask for less money than they actually need to make the game.

1062
00:52:40,326 --> 00:52:42,348
Usually substantially less money.

1063
00:52:42,348 --> 00:52:47,170
But it does give them up-front money for development and some leverage to go to a publisher later.

1064
00:52:47,170 --> 00:52:48,991
Hey, look at how awesome our Kickstarter was.

1065
00:52:48,991 --> 00:52:50,652
We asked for this much and we got this much.

1066
00:52:51,312 --> 00:52:53,474
You're kind of pre-selling part of your game.

1067
00:52:53,474 --> 00:52:56,116
But there's also been another nickname, which is,

1068
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:57,757
this is the kick finisher model.

1069
00:52:57,757 --> 00:52:59,438
We've seen more of this year and last year,

1070
00:52:59,438 --> 00:53:02,100
which is where teams take an almost complete game,

1071
00:53:02,100 --> 00:53:04,422
put it up on Kickstarter to get their last little bit

1072
00:53:04,422 --> 00:53:06,743
of revenue, or in some cases, don't even

1073
00:53:06,743 --> 00:53:09,565
care about the revenue, but use it as a marketing opportunity

1074
00:53:09,565 --> 00:53:13,768
or the ability to pre-sell a certain quantity of units

1075
00:53:13,768 --> 00:53:16,510
for their game and engage their community earlier.

1076
00:53:17,968 --> 00:53:20,590
So if we look at gaming projects on Kickstarter,

1077
00:53:20,590 --> 00:53:23,191
about one third gets successfully funded.

1078
00:53:23,191 --> 00:53:25,231
This year it was 34%, last year it was 33%,

1079
00:53:25,231 --> 00:53:26,912
the year before that it was 34%.

1080
00:53:26,912 --> 00:53:29,433
It's remained pretty consistent

1081
00:53:29,433 --> 00:53:31,534
with a 1% bounce rate back and forth.

1082
00:53:33,102 --> 00:53:39,364
And, you know, kind of speaking of the money, this is the distribution of successfully funded Kickstarter titles.

1083
00:53:39,364 --> 00:53:46,846
To date, there have been 76 games, as of the beginning of February, that have done more than a million dollars in raise.

1084
00:53:46,846 --> 00:53:51,788
And this is up 18 from last year, when there were 58 games that had done a million dollars or more.

1085
00:53:52,467 --> 00:53:55,328
We also added 178 games to the $100,000 to $1 million

1086
00:53:55,328 --> 00:53:58,429
range, which is five more than the increase from the year

1087
00:53:58,429 --> 00:53:58,989
before.

1088
00:53:58,989 --> 00:54:01,609
This being said, doing a Kickstarter

1089
00:54:01,609 --> 00:54:04,050
is getting harder and harder because we

1090
00:54:04,050 --> 00:54:06,410
have increasing degrees of polish that are being required,

1091
00:54:06,410 --> 00:54:08,231
and consumers are getting more sophisticated

1092
00:54:08,231 --> 00:54:09,271
on what they fund.

1093
00:54:09,271 --> 00:54:11,212
And again, this is especially true

1094
00:54:11,212 --> 00:54:13,532
because we're seeing teams bringing in almost finished

1095
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:15,372
games into Kickstarter.

1096
00:54:15,372 --> 00:54:17,113
And that's a lot easier to show and pitch

1097
00:54:17,113 --> 00:54:19,673
than a game that's a little bit of concept art

1098
00:54:19,673 --> 00:54:22,294
and somebody saying, this will be awesome in two years.

1099
00:54:22,334 --> 00:54:29,180
Of course, not every game gets funded. In fact, about two-thirds of them don't.

1100
00:54:29,180 --> 00:54:35,726
This is the distribution of unsuccessfully funded projects. 12% don't even get to the 1% mark.

1101
00:54:35,726 --> 00:54:42,411
67% get from the 1% to the 20%. Roughly 4,000 games were added to this category last year.

1102
00:54:43,019 --> 00:54:45,642
But what's really interesting is all of these percentages,

1103
00:54:45,642 --> 00:54:48,185
I had to double check, are exactly the same

1104
00:54:48,185 --> 00:54:50,168
as the graph from last year.

1105
00:54:50,168 --> 00:54:53,292
Meaning, literally, with 4,000 games added,

1106
00:54:53,292 --> 00:54:55,235
they fell into the exact same ratio

1107
00:54:55,235 --> 00:54:57,117
of how much money they didn't gather.

1108
00:54:57,885 --> 00:54:59,167
on their raise.

1109
00:54:59,167 --> 00:55:00,808
And so this basically kind of says,

1110
00:55:00,808 --> 00:55:06,153
this is solidifying on consumer response to Kickstarter

1111
00:55:06,153 --> 00:55:07,954
and crowdfunding things.

1112
00:55:07,954 --> 00:55:10,777
And if you look at it with a 2 3rd failure rate and 79%

1113
00:55:10,777 --> 00:55:13,079
of games only getting 20% or less of their ask,

1114
00:55:13,079 --> 00:55:17,122
this basically means more than half the games raising money

1115
00:55:17,122 --> 00:55:20,405
on Kickstarter, 53%, got no significant money.

1116
00:55:21,929 --> 00:55:23,792
So game broadcasting and rebroadcasting

1117
00:55:23,792 --> 00:55:25,694
in its myriad forms is now a big thing.

1118
00:55:25,694 --> 00:55:27,316
I could do an entire talk on this,

1119
00:55:27,316 --> 00:55:28,919
but sadly I don't have time this year,

1120
00:55:28,919 --> 00:55:31,021
so we're gonna show one slide.

1121
00:55:31,021 --> 00:55:33,805
Competitive multiplayer continues to dominate viewership.

1122
00:55:34,467 --> 00:55:35,788
You know, blue here is peak views,

1123
00:55:35,788 --> 00:55:37,209
gray is average concurrent,

1124
00:55:37,209 --> 00:55:39,170
which is what the chart is ranked by.

1125
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:41,312
League of Legends, Dota, Hearthstone,

1126
00:55:41,312 --> 00:55:42,793
CSGO, FIFA, Overwatch, you know,

1127
00:55:42,793 --> 00:55:45,315
these were the top viewed games last year.

1128
00:55:45,315 --> 00:55:47,576
And you know, certain things can spike you in there.

1129
00:55:47,576 --> 00:55:48,717
Community events, game launches,

1130
00:55:48,717 --> 00:55:50,258
competitive tournaments, fundraisers,

1131
00:55:50,258 --> 00:55:52,339
Twitch personalities, you know,

1132
00:55:52,339 --> 00:55:53,400
those can get you up for a bit,

1133
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,101
but sustained views, however,

1134
00:55:55,101 --> 00:55:57,343
are engaging, competitive multiplayer

1135
00:55:57,343 --> 00:55:59,804
backed by an engaged audience and compelling content.

1136
00:56:00,660 --> 00:56:03,863
And this coincides a lot with some of the e-sports tournament

1137
00:56:03,863 --> 00:56:04,224
scene.

1138
00:56:04,224 --> 00:56:08,047
We've seen tremendous growth since 2010 in the prize pool,

1139
00:56:08,047 --> 00:56:10,670
where in 2010 it was 3.25 million,

1140
00:56:10,670 --> 00:56:12,651
this year just under 80 million.

1141
00:56:12,651 --> 00:56:15,334
Notably, the prize pool per tournament's

1142
00:56:15,334 --> 00:56:18,557
grown at a very exceptional rate, also due to crowdfunding.

1143
00:56:18,557 --> 00:56:21,740
Dota's The Invitational has been particularly interesting

1144
00:56:21,740 --> 00:56:22,040
on that.

1145
00:56:23,708 --> 00:56:26,729
So I'm going to wrap up this year with one of the biggest surprise hits of the year of

1146
00:56:26,729 --> 00:56:27,849
Pokemon Go.

1147
00:56:27,849 --> 00:56:33,051
And part of the surprise was the extreme virality boosted by the power of its brand.

1148
00:56:33,051 --> 00:56:39,232
So on the virality aspect, this was a survey for where most people first heard about Pokemon

1149
00:56:39,232 --> 00:56:41,693
Go, and the answer was from a friend.

1150
00:56:41,693 --> 00:56:46,274
More than one-third of people who played Pokemon Go heard about the game from a friend.

1151
00:56:46,274 --> 00:56:48,855
That is an amazing amount of virality.

1152
00:56:49,635 --> 00:56:52,056
Number two, read about it.

1153
00:56:52,056 --> 00:56:53,577
So you can kind of see it trailing down.

1154
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:57,139
App Store was the lowest percent.

1155
00:56:57,139 --> 00:57:00,380
5% found out about it from the App Store.

1156
00:57:00,380 --> 00:57:03,922
So this was an actual phenomenon.

1157
00:57:03,922 --> 00:57:06,123
I was experiencing, any of you who walk through Central Park

1158
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:09,185
or walk through shopping malls filled with people

1159
00:57:09,185 --> 00:57:11,046
looking at their phone and bumping into things,

1160
00:57:11,046 --> 00:57:11,926
which again was awesome.

1161
00:57:12,890 --> 00:57:17,311
But the other thing, but the brand or the brand familiarity

1162
00:57:17,311 --> 00:57:19,572
was also a major factor in the virality.

1163
00:57:19,572 --> 00:57:22,893
In a crowded market, having a well-aligned, recognizable

1164
00:57:22,893 --> 00:57:25,774
brand is a critical means of driving consumer awareness

1165
00:57:25,774 --> 00:57:26,694
and interest.

1166
00:57:26,694 --> 00:57:29,335
Broadly accessible IPs, Disney, Marvel, Candy Crush,

1167
00:57:29,335 --> 00:57:31,596
they've historically seen the widest appeal.

1168
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:35,237
And more specific brands, celebrity, HD gaming,

1169
00:57:35,237 --> 00:57:37,657
mobile brands, publishers, tend to be a little more niche

1170
00:57:37,657 --> 00:57:38,418
in their appeal.

1171
00:57:38,658 --> 00:57:40,659
with Nintendo and its flagship Mario RP

1172
00:57:40,659 --> 00:57:42,060
being among the few exceptions,

1173
00:57:42,060 --> 00:57:44,222
but they still hold very strong potential

1174
00:57:44,222 --> 00:57:46,564
when aligned with gameplay.

1175
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:48,405
You know, in the middle of a crowded market,

1176
00:57:48,405 --> 00:57:53,188
finding a way to stand out and to signal value

1177
00:57:53,188 --> 00:57:57,111
is vitally important to the success of your game.

1178
00:57:57,111 --> 00:57:58,532
So I'd like to thank you for the opportunity

1179
00:57:58,532 --> 00:58:01,334
to present six years in a row awesome video game data.

1180
00:58:01,334 --> 00:58:03,016
