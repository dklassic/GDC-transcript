1
00:00:05,870 --> 00:00:09,273
Round 1, Fight!

2
00:00:42,314 --> 00:01:00,654
Come back here and let me stab you!

3
00:01:16,706 --> 00:01:40,599
A command post is no longer under Empire control.

4
00:01:40,599 --> 00:01:44,721
How do you feel about bullets?

5
00:02:05,525 --> 00:02:06,665
What's that?

6
00:02:06,665 --> 00:02:08,405
Now you are holding his head in your arms.

7
00:02:08,405 --> 00:02:09,226
Now you are... kissing him.

8
00:02:09,226 --> 00:02:09,586
What?

9
00:02:09,586 --> 00:02:15,047
Yes, you are kissing him in your arms.

10
00:02:15,047 --> 00:02:20,949
He's pulling your long hair, shoving his tongue deep inside your mouth.

11
00:02:20,949 --> 00:02:25,790
Knife? Ha ha. Yeah, you'll get knifed.

12
00:02:25,790 --> 00:02:29,291
Back again? Ha ha.

13
00:02:41,125 --> 00:02:42,927
Let me kill you!

14
00:02:42,927 --> 00:02:48,110
UAV recon standing by!

15
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,632
Our UAV is online!

16
00:02:51,632 --> 00:02:59,677
God dammit, Jackson!

17
00:02:59,677 --> 00:03:08,382
Weeeee! I win!

18
00:03:09,831 --> 00:03:13,928
YES! YES!

19
00:03:34,249 --> 00:03:39,091
I want to thank Robbie Cooper, who is a British photographer and video artist,

20
00:03:39,091 --> 00:03:45,713
for the use of his short film, Immersion, to kind of open my talk with this year.

21
00:03:45,713 --> 00:03:47,234
You might know Robbie Cooper for his work.

22
00:03:47,234 --> 00:03:52,195
He made a series of photos a few years ago of people with their avatars,

23
00:03:52,195 --> 00:03:57,737
mainly from MMOs, but also from various other kinds of games that were really beautiful and revealing.

24
00:03:58,707 --> 00:04:01,710
So, good afternoon everyone and welcome to my talk.

25
00:04:01,710 --> 00:04:06,935
Please silence your phones and other augmented reality devices.

26
00:04:06,935 --> 00:04:13,701
And when you receive your electronic evaluations in the email, please, please, please fill

27
00:04:13,701 --> 00:04:16,644
them out if you like the talk.

28
00:04:16,644 --> 00:04:18,126
If you don't like it, don't bother.

29
00:04:20,183 --> 00:04:25,950
And thanks to the awesome conference associates who, like every year, are helping us out,

30
00:04:25,950 --> 00:04:29,675
being incredible, making GDC happen all the time.

31
00:04:30,962 --> 00:04:35,826
So my talk today is the first kind of arty,

32
00:04:35,826 --> 00:04:37,888
wannabe intellectual game design talk

33
00:04:37,888 --> 00:04:39,770
that I've ever given at GDC.

34
00:04:39,770 --> 00:04:41,932
So I'm pretty nervous, in case you think

35
00:04:41,932 --> 00:04:44,034
it's a load of old bollocks.

36
00:04:44,034 --> 00:04:45,496
But please bear with me.

37
00:04:45,496 --> 00:04:46,517
It's also rather long.

38
00:04:46,517 --> 00:04:48,378
And I might go over the hour, but GDC

39
00:04:48,378 --> 00:04:51,642
have graciously given me an extra 10 minutes at the end.

40
00:04:51,642 --> 00:04:54,184
So hopefully we'll have some time for questions.

41
00:04:55,754 --> 00:05:00,241
My name is Richard Lemarchand and I'm lucky enough to be a lead game designer at a fantastic

42
00:05:00,241 --> 00:05:06,050
studio called Naughty Dog. I've been a professional game designer for a little over 20 years now,

43
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:10,036
working mainly in character action games. And I've worked at Naughty Dog for nearly

44
00:05:10,036 --> 00:05:10,998
eight years.

45
00:05:11,739 --> 00:05:17,241
I was either the lead or the co-lead game designer on all three games in the Uncharted series.

46
00:05:17,241 --> 00:05:21,903
Culminating, of course, in Uncharted 3 Drake's Deception, which we released last November.

47
00:05:21,903 --> 00:05:23,624
We've had... oh, gosh.

48
00:05:23,624 --> 00:05:28,386
Thanks. We've had terrific success with Uncharted 3,

49
00:05:28,386 --> 00:05:32,969
and even though I'm not going to put too much focus on the Uncharted games today,

50
00:05:32,969 --> 00:05:37,251
I'll tell you about some of the playtesting techniques later on

51
00:05:37,251 --> 00:05:40,392
that we used to improve and polish this, our latest game.

52
00:05:41,980 --> 00:05:45,263
But as well as leaving you with just a little bit of practical takeaway today,

53
00:05:45,263 --> 00:05:46,885
I have two other goals for my talk.

54
00:05:46,885 --> 00:05:50,067
Both of them to do with game design philosophy,

55
00:05:50,067 --> 00:05:54,651
and both of which I hope will be useful to you in your game design practice.

56
00:05:55,961 --> 00:06:01,405
One of them relates to my thoughts about the value and nature of what gets called experiential gameplay.

57
00:06:01,405 --> 00:06:06,029
Now, we've used this kind of gameplay to powerful effect in the Uncharted series.

58
00:06:06,029 --> 00:06:08,831
For example, in the peaceful village sequence in Uncharted 2.

59
00:06:08,831 --> 00:06:14,135
But it's also being used in many different ways by many different kinds of games,

60
00:06:14,135 --> 00:06:17,017
from the world of AAA to indie and art games.

61
00:06:17,017 --> 00:06:19,960
So we'll get back to this towards the end of my talk.

62
00:06:21,447 --> 00:06:25,869
But my first and biggest goal is kind of given away by the title of my talk.

63
00:06:25,869 --> 00:06:29,791
In the grand tradition of Jesse Schell's game design lenses,

64
00:06:29,791 --> 00:06:33,573
where Jesse gave us a big set of language for talking clearly

65
00:06:33,573 --> 00:06:37,195
about many different aspects of the game experience,

66
00:06:37,195 --> 00:06:38,695
I want to give us just one new lens.

67
00:06:38,695 --> 00:06:42,397
That is the concept of player attention.

68
00:06:43,688 --> 00:06:46,729
Now, attention in the way that psychologists talk about attention

69
00:06:46,729 --> 00:06:49,131
is very important when we're discussing the core

70
00:06:49,131 --> 00:06:51,432
of a good video game experience.

71
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:54,173
But it rarely gets discussed by designers here at GDC,

72
00:06:54,173 --> 00:06:56,034
at least in my experience.

73
00:06:56,034 --> 00:06:59,196
And I'd like to see if there's something that we can do about that.

74
00:06:59,196 --> 00:07:01,237
Part of the reason that I'm interested in this

75
00:07:01,237 --> 00:07:04,418
is because I'm hungry for knowledge about the human mind.

76
00:07:05,254 --> 00:07:07,776
and not just the kind of knowledge that science gives us,

77
00:07:07,776 --> 00:07:12,619
but the insight into what you might call the lived human experience

78
00:07:12,619 --> 00:07:13,940
that we can get from art.

79
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:17,843
And what better art form to explore these questions with than

80
00:07:17,843 --> 00:07:19,484
that of video games.

81
00:07:19,484 --> 00:07:23,126
The other reason that I want us to start talking about attention

82
00:07:23,126 --> 00:07:26,549
is my personal dislike, some might say my

83
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:30,491
unreasonable dislike, of a couple of innocent words.

84
00:07:30,491 --> 00:07:31,492
Here they are.

85
00:07:32,585 --> 00:07:35,827
poor, old, immersion, and immersive.

86
00:07:35,827 --> 00:07:40,749
Their relatives, engaging and engagement, are a little bit better,

87
00:07:40,749 --> 00:07:43,551
but I'm afraid not that much.

88
00:07:43,551 --> 00:07:47,173
Now we use these words all the time when we're talking about what makes games

89
00:07:47,173 --> 00:07:47,953
great,

90
00:07:47,953 --> 00:07:49,894
but do we really understand what they mean?

91
00:07:51,530 --> 00:07:54,474
their literal sense seems confusing.

92
00:07:54,474 --> 00:07:58,259
When we're immersed in a game, what are we under the surface of?

93
00:07:58,259 --> 00:08:00,663
Is it some kind of game design soup?

94
00:08:00,663 --> 00:08:05,710
Are we inside the gameplay or inside the graphics like

95
00:08:05,710 --> 00:08:08,794
James Woods making out with his creepy TV and video drone?

96
00:08:11,022 --> 00:08:13,603
In their landmark 2003 book, Rules of Play,

97
00:08:13,603 --> 00:08:17,884
Katie Salen and Eric Zimmerman talk about something that they call

98
00:08:17,884 --> 00:08:19,304
the immersive fallacy.

99
00:08:19,304 --> 00:08:23,465
They say that there's an idea prevalent among game designers and media theorists

100
00:08:23,465 --> 00:08:27,546
that the pleasure of a media experience lies in its ability

101
00:08:27,546 --> 00:08:33,308
to sensually transport the participant into an illusory, simulated reality.

102
00:08:34,074 --> 00:08:37,717
one so complete that ideally the frame

103
00:08:37,717 --> 00:08:41,521
falls away so that the player truly believes that he or she

104
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,524
is part of an imaginary world. And they go on to claim

105
00:08:45,524 --> 00:08:47,667
that this conception is a mistake.

106
00:08:49,951 --> 00:08:53,753
The use of the word immersion in this sense, which refers to our going

107
00:08:53,753 --> 00:08:57,755
beyond the boundary between our day-to-day world of IRL

108
00:08:57,755 --> 00:09:02,177
and into some machine-mediated consensual hallucination

109
00:09:02,177 --> 00:09:06,679
to borrow a bit of poetry from William Gibson, it comes from the world of

110
00:09:06,679 --> 00:09:07,559
virtual reality.

111
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:10,589
And it's an alluring idea.

112
00:09:10,589 --> 00:09:15,450
Certainly, the level of identification that we have with the protagonists in a movie

113
00:09:15,450 --> 00:09:16,831
or the hero of a game

114
00:09:16,831 --> 00:09:20,012
would suggest that we get caught up in fantasies quite thoroughly.

115
00:09:20,012 --> 00:09:24,333
And the amount of time that we at Naughty Dog spend grounding the reality of

116
00:09:24,333 --> 00:09:25,354
Uncharted

117
00:09:25,354 --> 00:09:26,834
in lots of different ways

118
00:09:26,834 --> 00:09:30,495
is testament to the importance of helping an audience suspend their disbelief.

119
00:09:32,479 --> 00:09:35,361
But the claim that you can make someone forget who they are

120
00:09:35,361 --> 00:09:38,003
and start to believe that they're someone else,

121
00:09:38,003 --> 00:09:41,126
just by enveloping them in pictures and sounds of another place and time,

122
00:09:41,126 --> 00:09:43,227
has never seemed quite right to me.

123
00:09:43,227 --> 00:09:47,451
It doesn't do justice to the game artisans who craft experiences

124
00:09:47,451 --> 00:09:51,194
that get and hold our attention in many different, ingenious ways.

125
00:09:51,194 --> 00:09:53,956
And even if we could pull off this trick

126
00:09:53,956 --> 00:09:55,697
of making you believe that you're someone else,

127
00:09:55,697 --> 00:09:57,258
would we really want to?

128
00:09:59,771 --> 00:10:05,334
If I could reach into your mind, make you forget who you are while leaving all of your

129
00:10:05,334 --> 00:10:10,797
skills and emotions intact, and have you literally believe that you and Nathan Drake hanging

130
00:10:10,797 --> 00:10:14,539
out the back of a cargo plane with a desert floor a quarter of a mile below you and a

131
00:10:14,539 --> 00:10:19,761
bunch of gun-wielding enemies up above you, you probably wouldn't be excited and entertained

132
00:10:19,761 --> 00:10:23,323
in the way that everyone at Naughty Dog hopes for for the players of our games.

133
00:10:23,323 --> 00:10:25,945
In fact, you'd almost certainly be scared shitless.

134
00:10:27,653 --> 00:10:32,695
No disrespect, you understand. I know you're all very courageous.

135
00:10:32,695 --> 00:10:36,397
Now, I do think that games, interactivity, and what you might call

136
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:41,439
overwhelming sensory inundation can change our identity

137
00:10:41,439 --> 00:10:46,662
in interesting ways that are worthy of a lot more exploration.

138
00:10:46,662 --> 00:10:51,324
The interactive theatrical production, Sleep No More, and Gaspar Noé's film

139
00:10:51,324 --> 00:10:56,127
Enter the Void, are two great, entirely different demonstrations of that fact.

140
00:10:57,572 --> 00:11:01,075
And here's some recent games that have played with this strange relationship

141
00:11:01,075 --> 00:11:03,897
between a game's protagonist and its player.

142
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:07,921
Gerowin Stout's Dinner Date and Swery's Deadly Premonition.

143
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:11,003
Now, both of these games show us that things aren't quite as simple

144
00:11:11,003 --> 00:11:15,967
as having some kind of one-to-one identification with a game's hero.

145
00:11:15,967 --> 00:11:21,692
As do just about all the games by Belgium-based art game developer, Tale of Tales.

146
00:11:21,692 --> 00:11:23,153
They too mess around with this idea.

147
00:11:25,777 --> 00:11:29,319
Now, I don't really want to be that semantics-quibbling guy.

148
00:11:29,319 --> 00:11:33,421
I actually think that the word immersion is fine when we use it casually

149
00:11:33,421 --> 00:11:35,743
or when we're sure what we're talking about.

150
00:11:35,743 --> 00:11:39,745
Virtual reality is very interesting and very important,

151
00:11:39,745 --> 00:11:41,606
getting more important all the time.

152
00:11:41,606 --> 00:11:44,068
And high-fidelity wraparound simulations

153
00:11:44,068 --> 00:11:46,909
are immersive in the real sense of the word, I think.

154
00:11:47,670 --> 00:11:49,990
But in the context of TV-based video games,

155
00:11:49,990 --> 00:11:52,491
the word immersion is a bit of a buzzword,

156
00:11:52,491 --> 00:11:54,351
and it can point us in the wrong direction

157
00:11:54,351 --> 00:11:57,131
when we're trying to analyze the games that we love,

158
00:11:57,131 --> 00:12:02,772
especially when we start talking about being immersed in gameplay.

159
00:12:02,772 --> 00:12:05,273
So how do I want us to talk instead?

160
00:12:05,273 --> 00:12:07,353
Well, it's really pretty simple.

161
00:12:07,353 --> 00:12:10,514
Video games entrance us by getting our attention,

162
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:14,394
and then they give us what we call a compelling experience

163
00:12:14,394 --> 00:12:15,835
by holding our attention.

164
00:12:17,402 --> 00:12:22,123
Loosely defined as the cognitive process of paying attention to one aspect of the environment

165
00:12:22,123 --> 00:12:26,784
while ignoring others, attention is one of the most widely studied and discussed subjects

166
00:12:26,784 --> 00:12:29,224
in the whole of psychology.

167
00:12:29,224 --> 00:12:31,885
So let's take a closer look at it just quickly.

168
00:12:31,885 --> 00:12:36,806
For many years, scientists believed that the human mind could only pay attention to one

169
00:12:36,806 --> 00:12:37,566
thing at a time.

170
00:12:37,566 --> 00:12:41,447
And psychologists call this our attentional bottleneck.

171
00:12:42,944 --> 00:12:47,766
The game designer Colin Northway has talked interestingly about this on his blog

172
00:12:47,766 --> 00:12:52,368
in terms of attention splitting. For example, he talks about how Starcraft

173
00:12:52,368 --> 00:12:52,848
players call

174
00:12:52,848 --> 00:12:57,190
attention the third resource, and expert players

175
00:12:57,190 --> 00:13:01,812
attempt to steal attention from their opponents with raids and harassment.

176
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:06,516
An attentional bottleneck is important for game designers to think about.

177
00:13:06,516 --> 00:13:10,060
In many games, we have to keep track of lots of different pieces of information.

178
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:15,146
How much health we currently have, how much ammo we have left, where the enemies and other

179
00:13:15,146 --> 00:13:17,488
immediate threats in the level are, and so on.

180
00:13:17,488 --> 00:13:22,214
If the player only has so much attention to go around, we as designers have to stay aware

181
00:13:22,214 --> 00:13:23,635
of this so that we don't overwhelm them.

182
00:13:25,667 --> 00:13:29,631
Now we now know that it's not quite true that we can only attend to one thing at a time.

183
00:13:29,631 --> 00:13:32,675
Our unconscious minds are always monitoring the world

184
00:13:32,675 --> 00:13:35,037
for the arrival of important new information.

185
00:13:35,037 --> 00:13:38,721
We call this vigilance and it's been studied quite a lot since the 1940s

186
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:42,965
because it's central to some very important jobs, things like

187
00:13:42,965 --> 00:13:46,309
air traffic control, military surveillance, even lifeguarding.

188
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:50,470
It's totally relevant for game designers of course. We're betting on the fact that our

189
00:13:50,470 --> 00:13:55,712
players are going to be able to be vigilant for hours on end. Whether you're keeping an

190
00:13:55,712 --> 00:14:02,634
eye out for incoming aircraft in flight control or staring eyeball-dryingly vigilant for incoming

191
00:14:02,634 --> 00:14:07,276
enemies in Action Button's awesome game Ziggurat, which you should check out on your iPhone.

192
00:14:09,125 --> 00:14:13,907
But it's tough to be vigilant. We all suffer from something called vigilance fatigue,

193
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:18,209
which means that after the first 15 minutes, only 15 minutes of paying close

194
00:14:18,209 --> 00:14:19,390
attention to something,

195
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:23,012
we become much more likely to miss new relevant information

196
00:14:23,012 --> 00:14:27,674
if the sensory footprint of that information is somehow small or kind of

197
00:14:27,674 --> 00:14:27,934
weak.

198
00:14:30,889 --> 00:14:35,236
Now scientists used to think that the more boring a task, the quicker vigilance fatigue

199
00:14:35,236 --> 00:14:35,696
kicks in.

200
00:14:35,696 --> 00:14:41,384
But recent research shows that it's just as much of an issue for interesting vigilance-based

201
00:14:41,384 --> 00:14:43,628
tasks like the ones in video games.

202
00:14:45,311 --> 00:14:47,352
People focusing on the same task for a long time

203
00:14:47,352 --> 00:14:49,994
and remaining vigilant

204
00:14:49,994 --> 00:14:53,096
eventually become distracted, irritable and impatient.

205
00:14:53,096 --> 00:14:58,620
Think about your mental state at the end of a six-hour online FPS jag

206
00:14:58,620 --> 00:15:02,423
or a protracted raid in an MMO. If you're anything like me, it's probably

207
00:15:02,423 --> 00:15:03,523
somewhat agitated.

208
00:15:04,947 --> 00:15:07,148
But interestingly, switching to another activity,

209
00:15:07,148 --> 00:15:11,370
especially one that is low-stress or even more interestingly, one that

210
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:12,010
contains

211
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:17,312
pastoral scenes of nature, almost immediately restores our ability to be

212
00:15:17,312 --> 00:15:19,113
vigilant within a few minutes.

213
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,916
which I think probably explains the patterns of self-guided player activity

214
00:15:22,916 --> 00:15:28,543
that we see in games like Skyrim, as we kind of cycle between exploration

215
00:15:28,543 --> 00:15:31,186
and more intense combat and then less intense

216
00:15:31,186 --> 00:15:35,472
and sometimes lengthy periods of just noodling around in our inventory.

217
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:42,717
Now, this need that we have to rotate between different tones and intensities of visual

218
00:15:42,717 --> 00:15:46,359
activity probably explains why movie makers talk about pacing.

219
00:15:46,359 --> 00:15:51,662
Here on the left is an intensity graph that the writer-producer Warren Skaran made for

220
00:15:51,662 --> 00:15:56,424
the movie Top Gun, as well as Freytag's famous triangular graph of dramatic structure, and

221
00:15:56,424 --> 00:16:00,826
Kurt Vonnegut talking with graphs about the shapes of stories.

222
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,687
I'd definitely check out this video on YouTube.

223
00:16:04,053 --> 00:16:08,076
And we certainly think about pacing a lot when we're planning the Uncharted games.

224
00:16:08,076 --> 00:16:13,620
And we space out intense periods of combat with less intensive exploration and problem-solving

225
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:19,065
and with experiential sequences like Uncharted 3's Lost in the Desert montage.

226
00:16:19,065 --> 00:16:24,729
So to wrap this section up, I quickly want to tell you about the two different kinds of attention that we have.

227
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:30,851
The first kind is something that I've been exploiting every time I bring up a new slide,

228
00:16:30,851 --> 00:16:34,114
using what's called your orienting reflex.

229
00:16:34,114 --> 00:16:38,599
Now this big change in your visual field has almost certainly succeeded in attracting your

230
00:16:38,599 --> 00:16:40,681
attention to the screen where I want it to be.

231
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:44,244
And it does so in a way that you don't have any real control over.

232
00:16:45,889 --> 00:16:50,152
Sudden loud sounds and motion in our visual field also have the same effect,

233
00:16:50,152 --> 00:16:54,135
as do the mention of your name, anything that threatens your survival,

234
00:16:54,135 --> 00:16:58,218
and just plain novelty, anything kind of new and different in your sensory environment has a

235
00:16:58,218 --> 00:17:01,881
tendency to attract your attention. Now this is called reflexive attention,

236
00:17:01,881 --> 00:17:06,344
and broadly speaking it happens at the back and at the sides of the brain.

237
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:12,784
The other kind of attention that we have is executive or voluntary attention.

238
00:17:12,784 --> 00:17:16,187
This is the attention that we are in charge of,

239
00:17:16,187 --> 00:17:19,709
which we choose to direct, which we have what's known as

240
00:17:19,709 --> 00:17:23,412
executive control over. Now executive attention

241
00:17:23,412 --> 00:17:27,416
is one of a group of executive functions, which also include things like

242
00:17:27,416 --> 00:17:28,416
problem-solving,

243
00:17:28,416 --> 00:17:32,039
decision-making, and the way that we monitor our own

244
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,642
actions. And this takes place primarily in the front of the brain.

245
00:17:38,148 --> 00:17:43,372
But executive attention can be tricked as it struggles to organize the world.

246
00:17:43,372 --> 00:17:46,795
And it has a tendency to assume that the world is continuous and predictable.

247
00:17:46,795 --> 00:17:49,818
You might be familiar with the brilliant person swap stunts

248
00:17:49,818 --> 00:17:52,460
pulled by the British illusionist Derren Brown,

249
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:54,942
where a victim, the woman in the white shirt,

250
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,044
ends up giving directions to two different people

251
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:00,907
without even realizing that the person they're talking to has changed.

252
00:18:00,907 --> 00:18:01,707
It's uncanny. She doesn't bat an eyelash.

253
00:18:10,568 --> 00:18:13,591
Now, the whole spectrum of executive functioning,

254
00:18:13,591 --> 00:18:15,613
where we make choices and take actions,

255
00:18:15,613 --> 00:18:19,177
is right at the heart of our craft as video game developers.

256
00:18:19,177 --> 00:18:22,360
This is what we're talking about whenever we talk about agency.

257
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:25,863
But it seems that we rarely talk about what the player is

258
00:18:25,863 --> 00:18:27,505
choosing to pay attention to.

259
00:18:27,505 --> 00:18:31,409
I wonder if that's because our executive attention is

260
00:18:31,409 --> 00:18:32,770
kind of out of sight, out of mind.

261
00:18:34,331 --> 00:18:38,333
In any case, I think we shouldn't forget that the players of the games that we design

262
00:18:38,333 --> 00:18:41,514
have a freedom and a capacity to express themselves

263
00:18:41,514 --> 00:18:44,196
simply by choosing what to pay attention to next,

264
00:18:44,196 --> 00:18:45,476
before they even take an action.

265
00:18:45,476 --> 00:18:49,158
And I don't know that the mainstream of video games

266
00:18:49,158 --> 00:18:51,739
often take advantage of this in a thoughtful way.

267
00:18:51,739 --> 00:18:55,201
And I'll admit to often being guilty, as a character action game designer,

268
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:57,942
of thinking of the player as pretty reflexive,

269
00:18:57,942 --> 00:19:01,444
running from one shiny thing to the next that we've placed in their path.

270
00:19:02,759 --> 00:19:09,426
Games like the contemplative Dear Esther and the atmospheric Proteus take a quite different

271
00:19:09,426 --> 00:19:11,328
approach of course.

272
00:19:11,328 --> 00:19:16,973
Proteus, which was developed by Ed Key with a reactive ambient score by David Kanaga,

273
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:18,655
is one of my favorite games of 2011.

274
00:19:18,655 --> 00:19:25,022
And if you enjoy meditative, interactive experiences and you haven't yet played Proteus, I implore

275
00:19:25,022 --> 00:19:26,123
you to seek it out.

276
00:19:27,977 --> 00:19:32,240
So anyway, that's a 10 cent tour of what cognitive scientists know about attention.

277
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,443
If you're interested, there's lots more good stuff to learn about this on Wikipedia.

278
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:40,746
So attention is probably important for game designers, right?

279
00:19:40,746 --> 00:19:42,967
Like other kinds of entertainment designers,

280
00:19:42,967 --> 00:19:45,929
we have to guide our audience's attention

281
00:19:45,929 --> 00:19:49,372
to the things that enrich their experience.

282
00:19:49,372 --> 00:19:54,135
And we have to steer their attention away from the things in our game that don't or won't.

283
00:19:54,915 --> 00:19:57,658
For example, game designers specializing in level layout

284
00:19:57,658 --> 00:20:02,102
use the weenie technique that we borrowed from theme park design

285
00:20:02,102 --> 00:20:05,626
to orient the audience's attention to these landmarks in the environment

286
00:20:05,626 --> 00:20:08,629
that poke up over the nearby things.

287
00:20:08,629 --> 00:20:12,492
And then we provide kind of sequences of cues and revelations

288
00:20:12,492 --> 00:20:16,196
on the paths that guide the players where they choose to go,

289
00:20:16,196 --> 00:20:18,138
having oriented themselves to these weenies.

290
00:20:20,424 --> 00:20:23,845
So, if we're going to talk about the ways that video games get and hold our attention,

291
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:28,747
instead of talking about immersion, we'd better take a quick look at some of the ways they do it.

292
00:20:28,747 --> 00:20:34,369
When I first sat down to think about this, I decided that most attention grabbers and

293
00:20:34,369 --> 00:20:39,170
keepers in video games fall into one of these three categories.

294
00:20:39,170 --> 00:20:44,332
Beauty, story, and gameplay.

295
00:20:44,332 --> 00:20:46,713
Now, this list seemed like a pretty good starting point,

296
00:20:46,713 --> 00:20:49,373
but it was going to change the more I thought about it.

297
00:20:51,488 --> 00:20:53,089
So let's begin with beauty.

298
00:20:53,089 --> 00:20:57,572
The simplest thing that I could think of that gets my attention in a video game

299
00:20:57,572 --> 00:20:59,233
is great art.

300
00:20:59,233 --> 00:21:03,315
You can talk about beauty in terms of symmetry, coherence,

301
00:21:03,315 --> 00:21:05,497
harmony, and ideal forms.

302
00:21:05,497 --> 00:21:08,799
You can also express it with logic and number.

303
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,060
We know about the complementarity of color,

304
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:13,782
the golden ratio, and the Fibonacci sequence.

305
00:21:15,252 --> 00:21:19,534
But when I thought about it some more, beauty didn't seem to be quite the right word.

306
00:21:19,534 --> 00:21:23,575
Not everything that gets our attention, like this, is traditionally beautiful.

307
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:26,296
Think about the striking work of H.R. Giger,

308
00:21:26,296 --> 00:21:30,098
or how much of the art we love is cute or zany.

309
00:21:30,098 --> 00:21:34,440
So I thought that maybe a better word than beauty was aesthetics.

310
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:39,342
That way we can include a wider range of tastes and philosophical ideas as well.

311
00:21:41,375 --> 00:21:45,758
But then I started looking for a way to describe this in even more general terms

312
00:21:45,758 --> 00:21:48,680
by talking about something that draws attention to itself

313
00:21:48,680 --> 00:21:52,063
by virtue of its difference from those things around it.

314
00:21:52,063 --> 00:21:56,306
So I decided to think like a graphic designer or an interface designer

315
00:21:56,306 --> 00:21:58,207
and call this contrast.

316
00:21:58,207 --> 00:22:02,350
That way, this category can include anything in our sensory field

317
00:22:02,350 --> 00:22:05,633
that leaps out at us, that grabs our reflexive attention

318
00:22:05,633 --> 00:22:08,255
in a way that is useful to our executive attention.

319
00:22:09,937 --> 00:22:14,179
Now, things in this first category, beauty, aesthetics, contrast,

320
00:22:14,179 --> 00:22:17,161
easily get our attention, I think.

321
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:21,744
They grab it quite powerfully in ways that we don't have that much resistance to.

322
00:22:21,744 --> 00:22:26,226
However, these kinds of things don't hold our attention for that long.

323
00:22:26,226 --> 00:22:29,548
Think about the way that people only spend an average of

324
00:22:29,548 --> 00:22:33,771
30 seconds or so looking at even the most famous paintings in the world.

325
00:22:34,632 --> 00:22:37,415
we easily tire of the contrast in the scene

326
00:22:37,415 --> 00:22:40,838
and our attention needs to move on to something else.

327
00:22:40,838 --> 00:22:41,899
So my second category starts out a story.

328
00:22:41,899 --> 00:22:44,982
Now, of course, story is a hot button topic

329
00:22:44,982 --> 00:22:48,065
for game developers, as you'll know

330
00:22:48,065 --> 00:22:53,090
if you've been reading Gamasutra in the last few years.

331
00:22:53,090 --> 00:22:57,294
My hope is that if we talk about it in terms of attention,

332
00:22:57,294 --> 00:22:59,736
then we can make it less loaded as a subject.

333
00:23:01,442 --> 00:23:06,309
Story and games are almost certainly the oldest human cultural traditions,

334
00:23:06,309 --> 00:23:09,754
and both of them demand and occupy our attention.

335
00:23:09,754 --> 00:23:15,101
Think about an early human shaman holding his village entranced around a fire

336
00:23:15,101 --> 00:23:18,846
with his tales of the gods and the birth of the universe.

337
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:26,617
However, unlike the linear story that's woven into the playful space of the Uncharted games,

338
00:23:26,617 --> 00:23:30,178
not many video games have a story in a traditional sense.

339
00:23:30,178 --> 00:23:33,899
And so I pretty quickly changed the section to narrative,

340
00:23:33,899 --> 00:23:37,380
to encompass many different kinds of games,

341
00:23:37,380 --> 00:23:40,081
from Rockstar's brilliant systemic narratives,

342
00:23:40,081 --> 00:23:44,502
all the way over to Daniel Ben-Mehri's new game, Storyteller.

343
00:23:46,141 --> 00:23:50,127
I think even the fact that a rook is shaped like a castle

344
00:23:50,127 --> 00:23:53,151
and a knight is shaped like a little horse

345
00:23:53,151 --> 00:23:55,174
is narrative.

346
00:23:55,174 --> 00:23:57,258
Thank you, sir.

347
00:23:57,258 --> 00:23:59,401
But to generalize even more broadly,

348
00:23:59,401 --> 00:24:01,985
this is all to do with social stuff.

349
00:24:03,032 --> 00:24:05,293
A 2007 study at Florida State University

350
00:24:05,293 --> 00:24:11,558
showed that we exhibit something called attentional adhesion

351
00:24:11,558 --> 00:24:15,381
not only towards people that we are attracted to

352
00:24:15,381 --> 00:24:19,584
but also towards people that we perceive as rivals for those

353
00:24:19,584 --> 00:24:21,246
attractive people's affections.

354
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:26,025
Now suddenly it seems scientifically comprehensible

355
00:24:26,025 --> 00:24:31,233
the interest that we all, men and women, gay and straight alike, have

356
00:24:31,233 --> 00:24:34,679
in the attractive, noble, crafty cast of Downton Abbey.

357
00:24:38,713 --> 00:24:42,135
So, opening the door to the social in this way

358
00:24:42,135 --> 00:24:45,978
will also let us talk about how social games of all kinds

359
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:50,521
hold our attention. Whether it's the split-screen co-op games of

360
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:54,283
Uncharted 3, or the social aspects of

361
00:24:54,283 --> 00:24:57,345
Facebook games and all of the other social games we've been playing recently.

362
00:24:59,167 --> 00:25:01,887
The developmental psychologist Michael Tomasello

363
00:25:01,887 --> 00:25:05,749
has written about something called the joint attentional scene

364
00:25:05,749 --> 00:25:09,830
and he describes how a shared experience of a third thing

365
00:25:09,830 --> 00:25:14,252
plays a fundamental role in our intellectual and social development

366
00:25:14,252 --> 00:25:18,453
and it might even be what gives us our essential humanity.

367
00:25:18,453 --> 00:25:21,834
Professor Janet Murray, author of course of Hamlet on the Holodeck,

368
00:25:21,834 --> 00:25:25,776
has run with the idea of joint attention in the direction of games

369
00:25:25,776 --> 00:25:28,437
and you should check out her work, you can find it online.

370
00:25:30,678 --> 00:25:33,021
And thinking about the social also made me think

371
00:25:33,021 --> 00:25:35,583
that this is why we've had so much success

372
00:25:35,583 --> 00:25:39,027
with the character-driven stories in the Uncharted games.

373
00:25:39,027 --> 00:25:41,850
By putting a focus on the people in the game,

374
00:25:41,850 --> 00:25:43,872
their fears and hopes,

375
00:25:43,872 --> 00:25:46,935
and the moment-to-moment nuances in the relationships between them,

376
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:51,499
We've been able to get and hold people's attention much more easily

377
00:25:51,499 --> 00:25:55,082
than by trying to use kind of more abstract, dry,

378
00:25:55,082 --> 00:25:59,066
plot-driven stories that many video games use and which focus on

379
00:25:59,066 --> 00:26:02,509
the power structures or the history of a fictional world.

380
00:26:05,059 --> 00:26:11,063
Now, I think it's averagely tough to get someone's attention with this story-narrative-social stuff.

381
00:26:11,063 --> 00:26:24,312
Screenwriting books like Blake Snyder's Save the Cat are full of advice about the very challenging task of quickly establishing characters that are likeable or empathic, so that we'll want to follow them along their path.

382
00:26:25,976 --> 00:26:29,961
and I think that narrative also has an averagely strong hold on people's

383
00:26:29,961 --> 00:26:30,681
attention

384
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:33,966
uh... and in a way but in a way that's curious because

385
00:26:33,966 --> 00:26:36,048
it doesn't decay very quickly over time

386
00:26:37,732 --> 00:26:41,774
Episodic fiction, where we might have to wait days or even weeks between

387
00:26:41,774 --> 00:26:44,676
chunks of a story, is testament to this weird fact.

388
00:26:44,676 --> 00:26:48,559
There's an anecdote about people in the 1800s

389
00:26:48,559 --> 00:26:54,462
lining the docks in New York City, waiting for the latest episode

390
00:26:54,462 --> 00:26:58,965
of Charles Dickens' serialized story, The Old Curiosity Shop,

391
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:02,187
to come in on the boat. It was serialized in a pulpy magazine.

392
00:27:03,731 --> 00:27:08,506
after he dropped a particularly spectacular cliffhanger on them

393
00:27:08,506 --> 00:27:09,770
in the previous episode.

394
00:27:13,187 --> 00:27:16,729
So my last category is gameplay.

395
00:27:16,729 --> 00:27:18,229
Now, games are made of several parts.

396
00:27:18,229 --> 00:27:19,730
They have rules, they're mechanics,

397
00:27:19,730 --> 00:27:22,952
that interact in a systemic way with players and resources

398
00:27:22,952 --> 00:27:25,734
to produce dynamics, which in turn yield

399
00:27:25,734 --> 00:27:28,875
emotional responses, aesthetics, in a different sense

400
00:27:28,875 --> 00:27:31,837
than I used earlier, for the players of the games.

401
00:27:31,837 --> 00:27:34,619
Now, you'll recognize this as the MDA model proposed

402
00:27:34,619 --> 00:27:37,300
by Robin Haneke, Marc LeBlanc, and Robert Zubek.

403
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:41,624
If you haven't read their paper about MDA, you must look it up on the web.

404
00:27:41,624 --> 00:27:44,446
It acts as a great concise explanation

405
00:27:44,446 --> 00:27:48,669
of how gameplay works to hold our attention and impact our emotions.

406
00:27:48,669 --> 00:27:53,734
The philosopher Bernard Suits defines a game

407
00:27:53,734 --> 00:27:57,256
as the voluntary attempt to overcome unnecessary

408
00:27:57,256 --> 00:28:00,439
obstacles in pursuit of specific goals.

409
00:28:01,477 --> 00:28:05,642
Now goals are what make a game different from a toy or a free play session.

410
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,927
We work towards long-term goals by means of attainable short-term goals

411
00:28:09,927 --> 00:28:13,891
that we put together strategically to get to the long-term goal.

412
00:28:13,891 --> 00:28:17,475
Things as simple as roll the dice or shoot the enemy,

413
00:28:17,475 --> 00:28:18,897
even as simple as take cover.

414
00:28:20,123 --> 00:28:25,766
Now these build into compulsion loops by way of letting us reach these satisfying points

415
00:28:25,766 --> 00:28:26,767
of resolution.

416
00:28:26,767 --> 00:28:33,430
The end of my turn, the dropping of the enemy, or the collapsing of three clumps of grass

417
00:28:33,430 --> 00:28:36,332
into a bush in Spry Fox's brilliant Triple Town.

418
00:28:36,332 --> 00:28:42,195
We string these loops and goals together into a gameplay experience potentially of many

419
00:28:42,195 --> 00:28:42,835
many hours.

420
00:28:44,977 --> 00:28:50,999
And I think this is also related to Jamie Griezmann's famous conception of the 30 seconds

421
00:28:50,999 --> 00:28:56,320
of fun in Halo, where an underlying pattern of player activity is repeated with continual

422
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,881
variation but over and over again to create the long-term enjoyment of the game.

423
00:29:00,881 --> 00:29:06,222
But there's a problem with calling this category gameplay.

424
00:29:06,849 --> 00:29:11,931
Not all the video games we love even have goals, and so by some of our best definitions,

425
00:29:11,931 --> 00:29:14,672
they're not very game-like, strictly speaking.

426
00:29:14,672 --> 00:29:18,193
Minecraft, at least before the single-player game came along,

427
00:29:18,193 --> 00:29:22,294
and SimCity are two video games that are very open-ended,

428
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:25,735
but which I've played compulsively for dozens, maybe hundreds of hours.

429
00:29:25,735 --> 00:29:29,156
And they are clearly doing something right to hold my attention,

430
00:29:29,156 --> 00:29:33,838
but quite how they're doing it has always been something of a mystery to me.

431
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:35,698
But I'll come back to this later on.

432
00:29:37,482 --> 00:29:41,825
So I almost changed this category to interactivity to make it more general.

433
00:29:41,825 --> 00:29:48,710
But let's call it lewdism instead, like ludic from the Latin ludus, as I'm sure you know,

434
00:29:48,710 --> 00:29:54,354
which describes play of all kinds, not just games, and which acknowledges the playful

435
00:29:54,354 --> 00:29:57,216
attitude that I think is necessary here.

436
00:29:57,216 --> 00:29:59,918
And this scheme needed a bit of pretentious Latin, anyway.

437
00:30:04,434 --> 00:30:08,378
So I think that when the human mind finds a system,

438
00:30:08,378 --> 00:30:12,561
it loves to study it, if the moving parts of the system

439
00:30:12,561 --> 00:30:16,025
are easily visible to us. This is Chris Burden's

440
00:30:16,025 --> 00:30:21,329
art installation, Metropolis II, which I recently saw at the LA County

441
00:30:21,329 --> 00:30:26,754
Museum of Art. And it's a system whose dynamics are plain to see.

442
00:30:26,754 --> 00:30:31,378
And it's fascinating, isn't it? These are all Hot Wheels cars, by the way.

443
00:30:32,132 --> 00:30:34,293
on an infinite loop.

444
00:30:34,293 --> 00:30:36,694
They have a custodian to take care of them in the middle.

445
00:30:36,694 --> 00:30:40,015
So we come for the regular structure and repetition in the system

446
00:30:40,015 --> 00:30:42,776
which gives our minds something to grasp quickly.

447
00:30:42,776 --> 00:30:46,538
Much like the way that we get fascinated by watching the waves

448
00:30:46,538 --> 00:30:47,778
lap into the shore.

449
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:53,000
and similarly like the self-similarity in this Romanesco broccoli.

450
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:57,182
But then we stay for the variability in the system

451
00:30:57,182 --> 00:31:00,683
like the ever-changing patterns in the flickering flames of a fire

452
00:31:00,683 --> 00:31:04,145
or the variable schedule of reinforcement

453
00:31:04,145 --> 00:31:08,746
in the payout of a slot machine. So to make things even more inclusive

454
00:31:08,746 --> 00:31:10,907
I'll also call this category systems.

455
00:31:13,093 --> 00:31:18,055
Now, when a rule of rules, resources, interactions and goals are well designed,

456
00:31:18,055 --> 00:31:20,136
gameplay is like mental catnip to us.

457
00:31:20,136 --> 00:31:27,759
I think that this gameplay lewdism systems category is the hardest to get a player's attention with.

458
00:31:27,759 --> 00:31:31,801
For example, it can be tough to teach a board game to someone who hasn't played it before and isn't that interested.

459
00:31:31,801 --> 00:31:36,543
And we have to work very hard to design video game opening sequences,

460
00:31:36,543 --> 00:31:38,423
like the beginning of Uncharted 2,

461
00:31:38,423 --> 00:31:41,425
which grab new players' attention very quickly.

462
00:31:42,992 --> 00:31:46,514
Simple mechanics probably get your attention more quickly

463
00:31:46,514 --> 00:31:49,315
since they're easier to understand and get behind.

464
00:31:49,315 --> 00:31:54,137
But as Jason Rohr pointed out in his keynote at the Montreal International

465
00:31:54,137 --> 00:31:55,878
Game Summit last year,

466
00:31:55,878 --> 00:32:01,260
games are clearly the form that is best at keeping people's attention.

467
00:32:01,260 --> 00:32:05,802
While a film struggles to keep you for longer than about three hours tops,

468
00:32:05,802 --> 00:32:10,264
a great video game can hold your attention for dozens, hundreds,

469
00:32:10,264 --> 00:32:12,105
even thousands of hours.

470
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:17,869
Now this is also where the depth of a game becomes important.

471
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:22,251
Game depth is a little hard to define, but let's say that a deep game

472
00:32:22,251 --> 00:32:26,513
is one that produces a large number of interesting choices

473
00:32:26,513 --> 00:32:29,834
in a comprehensible way from a compact,

474
00:32:29,834 --> 00:32:33,036
elegant set of rules. The deeper the game,

475
00:32:33,036 --> 00:32:37,938
the greater the opportunity it has to hold your attention for a long time

476
00:32:37,938 --> 00:32:39,218
with its gameplay alone.

477
00:32:40,606 --> 00:32:44,129
I think it's probably true to say that a game holds your attention best

478
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,392
when you feel that you haven't yet completely understood

479
00:32:47,392 --> 00:32:51,115
its complexity. And I'd like to thank my colleague

480
00:32:51,115 --> 00:32:55,018
Caitlin Burnell for that insight. Please check out her talk on Friday.

481
00:32:57,105 --> 00:33:00,807
So, I hope you're at least somewhat agreeing with me by now

482
00:33:00,807 --> 00:33:04,009
that we can cut through the confusion about what

483
00:33:04,009 --> 00:33:07,811
immersion and engagement might mean simply by saying

484
00:33:07,811 --> 00:33:11,553
good video games get and hold our attention

485
00:33:11,553 --> 00:33:14,975
using a mix of the elements in these three categories.

486
00:33:14,975 --> 00:33:19,898
Also, you can start to see how we could freely mix and match stuff from these

487
00:33:19,898 --> 00:33:22,679
categories to make different styles and genres of game

488
00:33:22,679 --> 00:33:26,781
drawing on them to serve each of our unique individual creative goals.

489
00:33:27,545 --> 00:33:30,585
we can also keep them in mind to use them when we need to.

490
00:33:30,585 --> 00:33:33,386
Just when we're losing the player's attention with one category,

491
00:33:33,386 --> 00:33:36,007
maybe when they're succumbing to vigilance fatigue,

492
00:33:36,007 --> 00:33:38,207
we could pull them back in by deploying another.

493
00:33:38,207 --> 00:33:41,868
A very simple example of this would be the way that

494
00:33:41,868 --> 00:33:43,769
back in the days of 16-bit platformers,

495
00:33:43,769 --> 00:33:46,789
we would vary the graphics and add new mechanics into the mix

496
00:33:46,789 --> 00:33:48,130
as the game progresses.

497
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:54,218
Now, we often get into difficult arguments, like the story arguments,

498
00:33:54,218 --> 00:33:59,501
when we try to compare video games to other forms like movies.

499
00:33:59,501 --> 00:34:01,222
And when you work on a game like Uncharted,

500
00:34:01,222 --> 00:34:05,585
you end up hearing all about that stuff.

501
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:08,948
By using this concept of attention to look at other forms,

502
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:14,251
I hope we can get a clearer idea of what video games are and aren't like.

503
00:34:15,029 --> 00:34:21,637
This kind of framework cuts us loose from subjective, ideological evaluations of the

504
00:34:21,637 --> 00:34:23,098
value of different forms.

505
00:34:23,098 --> 00:34:29,165
And it leaves us free to evaluate what does and doesn't work, both functionally and artistically.

506
00:34:30,432 --> 00:34:36,095
So whether we're discussing games, films, sports, or even just some drunkard falling over at a party,

507
00:34:36,095 --> 00:34:39,596
the kinds of statements we can now make are simple and to the point.

508
00:34:39,596 --> 00:34:47,261
And we can more easily draw out the ways in which each of these things are similar to and different from one another.

509
00:34:47,261 --> 00:34:54,344
So as we learned from Colin Northway and the StarCraft players, human attention is a limited resource.

510
00:34:54,344 --> 00:34:55,485
There's only so much of it.

511
00:34:55,485 --> 00:34:58,487
There's a cap on the rate at which it can be parceled out.

512
00:34:59,393 --> 00:35:02,215
It diminishes and recharges over time.

513
00:35:02,215 --> 00:35:05,376
But you can improve your attentive capacity.

514
00:35:05,376 --> 00:35:09,698
In fact, the games we make are helping people do just that.

515
00:35:09,698 --> 00:35:13,500
Ongoing research from Daphne Bavellier's group at the University of

516
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:14,100
Rochester,

517
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:18,122
one of whose experiments are shown here,

518
00:35:18,122 --> 00:35:21,003
shows that people who play action video games

519
00:35:21,003 --> 00:35:25,445
have better, faster visual attention skills than people who don't.

520
00:35:25,445 --> 00:35:28,747
And the change takes place quite quickly, after quite short play sessions.

521
00:35:30,726 --> 00:35:36,020
So, since attention is a resource, you'd think that it would be great subject matter for video games.

522
00:35:37,885 --> 00:35:41,228
But there haven't been that many games that are explicitly about attention.

523
00:35:41,228 --> 00:35:45,572
You can find some very simple attention training games on the web.

524
00:35:45,572 --> 00:35:48,775
But there are a couple of interesting ones that I'm...

525
00:35:48,775 --> 00:35:52,218
interesting attention-based games that I'm aware of.

526
00:35:52,218 --> 00:35:54,740
Eric Zimmerman and the team at GameLab

527
00:35:54,740 --> 00:35:57,563
made a game a few years ago called Arcadia,

528
00:35:57,563 --> 00:36:00,485
where you had to play multiple action games at once.

529
00:36:00,485 --> 00:36:01,646
It was very difficult.

530
00:36:02,371 --> 00:36:05,133
And of course, Chris Hecker's game, Spy Party,

531
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:08,736
is specifically about using the player's attention

532
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:11,819
as a resource that they have to manage throughout the game.

533
00:36:11,819 --> 00:36:15,382
In fact, I'd like to make the claim

534
00:36:15,382 --> 00:36:19,645
that attention is the basic currency

535
00:36:19,645 --> 00:36:22,168
in which video games trade,

536
00:36:22,168 --> 00:36:26,091
and in which nearly every cultural form trades as well.

537
00:36:29,545 --> 00:36:34,426
So I really wanted to talk about game addiction today,

538
00:36:34,426 --> 00:36:38,287
which is a difficult and polarizing, but I think,

539
00:36:38,287 --> 00:36:39,647
interesting subject.

540
00:36:39,647 --> 00:36:42,988
And I can't help but feel that we should talk about it more

541
00:36:42,988 --> 00:36:44,708
as a community of game designers.

542
00:36:44,708 --> 00:36:48,169
I kept coming back to it over and over again while I was

543
00:36:48,169 --> 00:36:52,150
writing this talk because of what seemed to me to be a

544
00:36:52,150 --> 00:36:55,691
clear relationship between game addiction and attention.

545
00:36:57,082 --> 00:37:00,304
What we call addictive games pull your attention back to them

546
00:37:00,304 --> 00:37:04,407
over and over again and then hold it for a really long time.

547
00:37:04,407 --> 00:37:08,810
Games that cause people addiction-related problems in their lives

548
00:37:08,810 --> 00:37:12,433
are perhaps too good at getting and holding

549
00:37:12,433 --> 00:37:14,434
that particular person's attention.

550
00:37:14,434 --> 00:37:20,498
So unfortunately it would take me a lot more than an hour to do this subject

551
00:37:20,498 --> 00:37:23,701
justice but I hope someone at another GDC

552
00:37:23,701 --> 00:37:25,862
can come back to this subject and run with it.

553
00:37:28,506 --> 00:37:33,727
So, the player has all this attention, which they're bringing to bear on our games.

554
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:37,748
How is that practically relevant for game designers?

555
00:37:37,748 --> 00:37:40,929
Well, I don't have time to speak to every kind of game,

556
00:37:40,929 --> 00:37:46,770
so I'll just tell you about our experiences from the development of Uncharted.

557
00:37:46,770 --> 00:37:51,371
Often in our video games, we want to direct the player's visual attention

558
00:37:51,371 --> 00:37:57,892
to an aspect of the environment. A ladder, a door, maybe an enemy, or even a simple ledge.

559
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:03,122
Now there are lots of things that impact the visibility of things in the environment.

560
00:38:03,122 --> 00:38:07,085
The silhouette of the object and the background that it's against.

561
00:38:07,085 --> 00:38:12,728
Its hue, saturation and value, all of which are affected by the lighting of the scene.

562
00:38:12,728 --> 00:38:16,791
Then there's the composition of the view of the scene and the lines and shapes within

563
00:38:16,791 --> 00:38:21,494
it and the density of detail and any animation that it contains.

564
00:38:21,494 --> 00:38:26,217
Now if even one of these things is out of whack, then the player won't see what we need

565
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:26,757
them to see.

566
00:38:27,812 --> 00:38:34,888
And every Uncharted game has presented literally thousands of these kinds of challenges for us to overcome, as you can imagine.

567
00:38:36,567 --> 00:38:43,071
But there are a couple of simple tips for you to know about here, if you're working in character action games and maybe some other related kinds of games.

568
00:38:43,071 --> 00:38:52,355
We found that players rarely look outside this central part of the screen, unless it's to look at the meta information like the HUD.

569
00:38:52,355 --> 00:38:58,318
And that causes them to often miss things that might be in plain sight, but which are out in the corner.

570
00:38:59,487 --> 00:39:03,714
Also, players are more attentive to things in the lower half of the screen

571
00:39:03,714 --> 00:39:07,121
than in the upper half because of something called visual gravity.

572
00:39:10,098 --> 00:39:13,319
Now, Bruce Block talks about these elements and many more

573
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:15,380
in his excellent book, The Visual Story,

574
00:39:15,380 --> 00:39:18,561
which I think should be required reading for every video game

575
00:39:18,561 --> 00:39:19,761
designer.

576
00:39:19,761 --> 00:39:21,962
And I also like this book on the right,

577
00:39:21,962 --> 00:39:24,723
Composition, from the excellent DK Eyewitness art series,

578
00:39:24,723 --> 00:39:27,644
for just some simple tips about the way

579
00:39:27,644 --> 00:39:30,125
that lines of force in a composition

580
00:39:30,125 --> 00:39:33,546
drive your eye around the scene in useful ways to us.

581
00:39:34,917 --> 00:39:44,679
The takeaway for game designers here is that subtle details in the art of your game don't

582
00:39:44,679 --> 00:39:49,541
just make it more or less pretty, they make it possible for the player to play your game

583
00:39:49,541 --> 00:39:50,801
at all.

584
00:39:50,801 --> 00:39:55,262
Now my friend Robin Hunnecke, who works at that game company, told me that working on

585
00:39:55,262 --> 00:39:58,743
Journey, their latest game, they created a new term for this.

586
00:39:58,743 --> 00:40:03,464
They called it attentional design and you can see it at work in the opening moments

587
00:40:03,464 --> 00:40:04,185
of their game.

588
00:40:05,276 --> 00:40:09,160
The way that the player's attention is drawn first to the character that they will play

589
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:15,066
at the very beginning of the game by the character's isolation in the scene, and then the suggestion

590
00:40:15,066 --> 00:40:19,150
that the character is now controllable because of the way that it's risen to its feet.

591
00:40:19,150 --> 00:40:23,995
The establishment first of the hill as a short-term goal for the player through the use of attention

592
00:40:23,995 --> 00:40:25,597
grabbing detail and animation.

593
00:40:26,444 --> 00:40:30,987
and then the establishment of the mountain as a long-term goal for the player

594
00:40:30,987 --> 00:40:36,111
by a change in camera position that frames the composition in such an impactful way.

595
00:40:36,111 --> 00:40:41,876
All of these are subtle ways of designing to direct the player's attention in gameplay

596
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:44,378
towards the mechanics and the goals of the game.

597
00:40:45,661 --> 00:40:50,365
Now Robin told me that even these simple seeming things took many, many hours of work to accomplish

598
00:40:50,365 --> 00:40:51,166
and finesse.

599
00:40:51,166 --> 00:40:55,310
And I know from our work on the Uncharted series just how hard we have to work to direct

600
00:40:55,310 --> 00:41:00,155
the player's visual attention and their auditory attention in subtle ways like these.

601
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:06,276
Now, visual attention is a lot weirder than you might think.

602
00:41:06,276 --> 00:41:10,379
We can only see a clear, sharp image with a tiny, tiny part of our retinas.

603
00:41:10,379 --> 00:41:11,800
It's something called the fovea.

604
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:15,503
It's right in the middle of the retina. It's about a millimeter across

605
00:41:15,503 --> 00:41:20,867
and it's responsible for a full half the signals that travel down your optic nerve.

606
00:41:20,867 --> 00:41:23,689
If you hold your arm out at arm's length and look at your thumb,

607
00:41:23,689 --> 00:41:26,010
that's about the size, the width of your thumb

608
00:41:26,010 --> 00:41:30,153
is about the size of this tiny patch of visual acuity that you have.

609
00:41:32,158 --> 00:41:36,281
So because of this, we can't look at a scene in fixed steadiness

610
00:41:36,281 --> 00:41:40,204
the way that some other animals, like birds for instance, do.

611
00:41:40,204 --> 00:41:42,886
Instead, we build up a 3D picture of the world

612
00:41:42,886 --> 00:41:46,028
by zooming our eyes around it with these quick,

613
00:41:46,028 --> 00:41:49,711
simultaneous movements of the eyes called saccades,

614
00:41:49,711 --> 00:41:51,092
that's S-A-C-C-A-D-E-S,

615
00:41:51,092 --> 00:41:54,114
which are punctuated by periods of rest called fixations.

616
00:41:54,114 --> 00:41:58,537
And saccades are actually the fastest movements

617
00:41:58,537 --> 00:41:59,858
that the human body can make.

618
00:42:00,974 --> 00:42:04,037
and we tend to fixate on clusters of detail which explains

619
00:42:04,037 --> 00:42:09,684
a lot of the stuff that's in that composition book. Thanks by the way to

620
00:42:09,684 --> 00:42:12,347
Jerry for the use of his

621
00:42:12,347 --> 00:42:16,291
graduate thesis project foveation movie here. I thought it was really

622
00:42:16,291 --> 00:42:18,033
a clear way of explaining how this works.

623
00:42:19,860 --> 00:42:24,004
So, knowing this, you'd think that we would want to set up eye-tracking equipment when

624
00:42:24,004 --> 00:42:28,607
we playtest to be able to see exactly what our players are fixating on.

625
00:42:28,607 --> 00:42:30,209
And boy, oh boy, would I like to!

626
00:42:30,209 --> 00:42:35,333
I've always been fascinated by the kind of technology that can be used to see exactly

627
00:42:35,333 --> 00:42:37,915
where on screen someone is looking.

628
00:42:37,915 --> 00:42:39,836
For instance, web developers use it all the time.

629
00:42:40,197 --> 00:42:43,419
and I'm itching to get my hands on some eye tracking kit.

630
00:42:43,419 --> 00:42:46,841
But it's not something that we've done yet. Naughty Dog, if there's any eye tracking

631
00:42:46,841 --> 00:42:48,522
companies out there who'd like to

632
00:42:48,522 --> 00:42:50,863
hook us up with a freebie, please let me know.

633
00:42:53,663 --> 00:42:58,027
Valve, though, have had some experience using eye tracking as part of their playtesting

634
00:42:58,027 --> 00:43:02,011
process, as I think of people in the greater Sony organization.

635
00:43:02,011 --> 00:43:03,713
Sony, oh, Naughty Dog, of course.

636
00:43:03,713 --> 00:43:09,298
In fact, Valve even rigged Portal 2 so that you could play it using your gaze to aim the

637
00:43:09,298 --> 00:43:11,240
portal gun around the level.

638
00:43:12,541 --> 00:43:16,684
Now this kind of technology is an amazing boon for paralyzed people, of course,

639
00:43:16,684 --> 00:43:19,126
and I think we'll be seeing a lot more of it in the future.

640
00:43:19,126 --> 00:43:21,668
It's going to become cheaper and more usable,

641
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:25,330
and I think that eye-tracking technology could well become standard equipment

642
00:43:25,330 --> 00:43:28,593
for game developers, maybe even game audiences,

643
00:43:28,593 --> 00:43:30,454
over the course of the next 10 years.

644
00:43:32,433 --> 00:43:37,535
However, right now, eye tracking technology is still very expensive.

645
00:43:37,535 --> 00:43:40,176
Around $10,000 a seat, I believe.

646
00:43:40,176 --> 00:43:44,457
And even if you could afford eye tracking, it might not be desirable.

647
00:43:44,457 --> 00:43:46,777
In his excellent talk at GDC in 2009,

648
00:43:46,777 --> 00:43:50,058
Valve's biometrics expert, Mike Ambinder,

649
00:43:50,058 --> 00:43:54,900
mentioned a study that showed that when people know that their eyes are being tracked,

650
00:43:55,240 --> 00:43:59,181
and you usually know because you have to like put your head in this weird equipment or

651
00:43:59,181 --> 00:44:04,003
put these special glasses on, then people move their eyes around somewhat

652
00:44:04,003 --> 00:44:05,944
differently. They become kind of self-conscious

653
00:44:05,944 --> 00:44:10,426
about where their gaze is. So how else can we keep track of the players visual

654
00:44:10,426 --> 00:44:11,206
attention

655
00:44:11,206 --> 00:44:14,627
to make sure that the attentional design techniques that we're trying to use

656
00:44:14,627 --> 00:44:17,989
are working? Well of course we study our players attention

657
00:44:17,989 --> 00:44:22,430
all the time when we're using one of our most important game design tools

658
00:44:22,430 --> 00:44:23,951
namely playtesting.

659
00:44:26,946 --> 00:44:31,735
Now, I'm sure, I'm quite sure everyone here knows about the importance of playtesting.

660
00:44:31,735 --> 00:44:36,745
Although, you'd be surprised to hear just how many game developers still make do without it.

661
00:44:37,712 --> 00:44:42,035
Now we playtest our games all the time on each other, of course, as developers while

662
00:44:42,035 --> 00:44:42,735
we're making them.

663
00:44:42,735 --> 00:44:48,799
But the kind of playtest I'm talking about now is formal playtesting with groups of,

664
00:44:48,799 --> 00:44:54,021
for us, ten at a time Kleenex playtesters from the general public who have never seen

665
00:44:54,021 --> 00:44:57,343
our game before and who will only use to test it just once.

666
00:44:59,317 --> 00:45:05,682
When I joined Naughty Dog to help finish Jack 3, we ran perhaps 4 or 5 playtests over the

667
00:45:05,682 --> 00:45:07,183
course of the project.

668
00:45:07,183 --> 00:45:12,828
For Uncharted 3, we ran 21 tests over the course of the last 6 months of development.

669
00:45:12,828 --> 00:45:15,050
So you can tell how important it is to us.

670
00:45:15,831 --> 00:45:19,814
And we run these tests in-house in a dedicated playtest room.

671
00:45:19,814 --> 00:45:22,837
Each playtester's station has a networked PlayStation 3

672
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,538
with a build of the game that we're testing.

673
00:45:24,538 --> 00:45:26,059
They have headphones.

674
00:45:26,059 --> 00:45:28,722
And there's a networked DVR box that

675
00:45:28,722 --> 00:45:32,605
will capture video of the gameplay to our network

676
00:45:32,605 --> 00:45:34,547
as the players play.

677
00:45:34,547 --> 00:45:36,889
Screens separate the stations from each other

678
00:45:36,889 --> 00:45:39,471
so that the players can't see each other's games,

679
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:41,072
even accidentally.

680
00:45:41,072 --> 00:45:42,814
And we ask them not to talk to each other

681
00:45:42,814 --> 00:45:43,615
during the playtest.

682
00:45:45,125 --> 00:45:51,127
And because we want to be as scientific as possible in this, we're ruthless about not giving them any help with what they're playing.

683
00:45:51,127 --> 00:46:02,491
As the players play, the game records certain information about the gameplay session and posts it to a database on our network.

684
00:46:02,491 --> 00:46:04,051
We call this our metric data.

685
00:46:05,956 --> 00:46:09,780
Then, at the end of the playtest, we get the playtesters to fill out a questionnaire

686
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,384
about their experience and we conduct an exit interview

687
00:46:13,384 --> 00:46:16,167
in quite small groups, three people at a time,

688
00:46:16,167 --> 00:46:19,951
although one person at a time would probably be even better.

689
00:46:20,691 --> 00:46:22,373
and we video record these.

690
00:46:22,373 --> 00:46:23,894
And these are really useful.

691
00:46:23,894 --> 00:46:26,257
The questionnaires are really useful to help us track the

692
00:46:26,257 --> 00:46:30,280
improvement in the players' perceptions of our game

693
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,142
from test to test.

694
00:46:32,142 --> 00:46:34,444
We've been lucky, maybe,

695
00:46:34,444 --> 00:46:37,246
to always see a slow, gradual improvement.

696
00:46:37,527 --> 00:46:41,331
and that is really valuable for helping us to stay sane

697
00:46:41,331 --> 00:46:44,294
in the knowledge that the game is gradually getting better,

698
00:46:44,294 --> 00:46:49,138
especially if we've recently made a big change somewhere in the gameplay.

699
00:46:49,138 --> 00:46:52,962
And we also get some interesting, if kind of anecdotal, game design perspectives

700
00:46:52,962 --> 00:46:54,164
that we can discuss

701
00:46:54,164 --> 00:46:55,205
from the exit interviews.

702
00:46:56,885 --> 00:47:01,147
Then immediately after the playtest, we take a look at the metric data, which lets us visualize

703
00:47:01,147 --> 00:47:05,630
how playable the game is. One way we do this is by compiling a table of how many times

704
00:47:05,630 --> 00:47:10,252
the players died in each small chunk of the game. And then I use the conditional formatting

705
00:47:10,252 --> 00:47:16,556
in Excel to see where the average and maximum deaths for each little bit of the game exceeds

706
00:47:16,556 --> 00:47:21,819
certain thresholds. And this is super useful to immediately alerting us to the parts of

707
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:26,542
the game that are still too hard, because they just jump right out at you, red and pink.

708
00:47:29,392 --> 00:47:31,355
But back to attention.

709
00:47:31,355 --> 00:47:34,139
One way that we can track a player's attention without this expensive

710
00:47:34,139 --> 00:47:38,486
equipment is ridiculously simple. It's just by watching them play

711
00:47:38,486 --> 00:47:40,589
or by watching their gameplay videos later.

712
00:47:41,127 --> 00:47:45,608
In a game like ours, it's easy to see when someone isn't seeing something

713
00:47:45,608 --> 00:47:47,809
or has forgotten their goal.

714
00:47:47,809 --> 00:47:51,210
When players repeatedly run right past the object that they're meant to be

715
00:47:51,210 --> 00:47:52,791
interacting with,

716
00:47:52,791 --> 00:47:55,392
it's a pretty sure sign that they can't see it.

717
00:47:55,392 --> 00:47:58,433
If they go up to it from time to time and try and use it, but then

718
00:47:58,433 --> 00:47:59,894
leave it alone for a long time,

719
00:47:59,894 --> 00:48:03,515
you know they can see it, but they don't think it's important.

720
00:48:03,515 --> 00:48:04,675
This is one of our

721
00:48:04,675 --> 00:48:06,236
playtest gameplay videos, by the way.

722
00:48:07,418 --> 00:48:10,201
So we make notes about these situations as we observe them,

723
00:48:10,201 --> 00:48:12,464
and then we make fixes between playtests,

724
00:48:12,464 --> 00:48:15,447
and then we watch out for improvements in the next test.

725
00:48:15,447 --> 00:48:17,910
And just by doing this, you can make an amazing difference

726
00:48:17,910 --> 00:48:20,293
to the way that your players' attention moves

727
00:48:20,293 --> 00:48:22,675
over the sensory surface of your game.

728
00:48:22,675 --> 00:48:25,298
And you can seriously improve the amount of fun

729
00:48:25,298 --> 00:48:28,081
that your players have with your game as a result.

730
00:48:31,458 --> 00:48:37,101
But what about tougher problems, where the player's attention isn't so easy to observe?

731
00:48:37,101 --> 00:48:40,982
Well, you can use your metric data in some clever ways to get a handle on these kinds

732
00:48:40,982 --> 00:48:42,483
of issues.

733
00:48:42,483 --> 00:48:45,624
The environments in Uncharted are visually very dense.

734
00:48:45,624 --> 00:48:50,165
Thanks to our brilliant artists, there's a lot going on in the picture of any random

735
00:48:50,165 --> 00:48:51,286
Uncharted screenshot.

736
00:48:51,286 --> 00:48:57,368
And like we were just discussing, it's very easy for things that are important to gameplay

737
00:48:57,368 --> 00:49:00,009
to get lost among all that visual information.

738
00:49:01,775 --> 00:49:07,136
So because of this, we faced a nasty recurring problem in the development of the Uncharted games,

739
00:49:07,136 --> 00:49:10,257
one that dated all the way back to the beginning of the series.

740
00:49:10,257 --> 00:49:16,578
We found that players would often have a difficult time spotting the edge grabs in the environments.

741
00:49:16,578 --> 00:49:19,539
Now this was usually a disaster for us, of course,

742
00:49:19,539 --> 00:49:23,780
because it would stop them climbing onwards to the next part of the game.

743
00:49:23,780 --> 00:49:26,780
There's a lot of climbing on edge grabs in Uncharted.

744
00:49:27,425 --> 00:49:31,947
And the problem was compounded by the fact that players would also get distracted by things

745
00:49:31,947 --> 00:49:35,168
that looked like they were climbable, but which weren't.

746
00:49:35,168 --> 00:49:39,130
So the solution to this problem was quite brilliant,

747
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:42,511
and it came from these three handsome men.

748
00:49:42,511 --> 00:49:46,793
Lead technical artist, Teagan Morrison, on the left.

749
00:49:46,793 --> 00:49:49,754
Lead gameplay programmer, Travis McIntosh, in the middle.

750
00:49:49,754 --> 00:49:53,456
And gameplay programmer, Jarosl Szynecki, on the right.

751
00:49:55,118 --> 00:50:00,163
What we did was to set up a system that we only used during our formal playtests

752
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,726
that would record an XYZ coordinate every time the player pressed the jump button

753
00:50:04,726 --> 00:50:09,510
and didn't end up jumping to a ledge, but instead jumped up and down on the spot.

754
00:50:09,510 --> 00:50:13,534
And then we wrote those coordinates to the metrics database,

755
00:50:13,534 --> 00:50:17,017
and then when the playtest was complete, we exported this data back into the game,

756
00:50:17,017 --> 00:50:21,941
and we put a little red sphere where every thwarted jump had taken place

757
00:50:21,941 --> 00:50:24,303
for every single player in that week's test.

758
00:50:25,308 --> 00:50:27,551
And we called this our bad jumps system.

759
00:50:27,551 --> 00:50:33,380
You could immediately see the bad jumps clustered beneath objects that looked like edge grabs,

760
00:50:33,380 --> 00:50:34,321
but weren't.

761
00:50:34,321 --> 00:50:37,186
And they told us immediately what we needed to fix.

762
00:50:38,857 --> 00:50:42,881
So in the days after each playtest, the environment artists would go through their levels with

763
00:50:42,881 --> 00:50:47,805
the bad jumps turned on. We'd have discussions about what needed fixing when we needed to.

764
00:50:47,805 --> 00:50:53,570
And then the artists would make changes to the artwork of the things that our playtesters

765
00:50:53,570 --> 00:50:59,895
thought had grabbable edges, but in fact didn't, to try and make them look less like handholds.

766
00:51:00,795 --> 00:51:04,557
And we were able to make a huge difference in the game by doing this.

767
00:51:04,557 --> 00:51:07,479
I wouldn't care to say that we fixed this issue completely,

768
00:51:07,479 --> 00:51:11,581
but definitely we were really satisfied by the results that we got

769
00:51:11,581 --> 00:51:13,722
just from setting up this simple system.

770
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:15,343
It only took a few hours to create.

771
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:22,043
And we invented some other similar attention tracking metrics for Uncharted 3.

772
00:51:22,043 --> 00:51:26,286
How often did players pick up a new gun, hold it for a moment, and then drop it again in

773
00:51:26,286 --> 00:51:27,408
favor of their old gun?

774
00:51:27,408 --> 00:51:30,110
That was really easy to record in our metric data.

775
00:51:30,110 --> 00:51:34,454
So was the data you can see here, the number of successful and failed attempts that players

776
00:51:34,454 --> 00:51:39,538
made to throw back grenades, instead of ignoring the grenade throwback mechanic altogether.

777
00:51:40,459 --> 00:51:44,885
And this technique seems like it could be applied to widely different styles of games.

778
00:51:44,885 --> 00:51:47,989
I'm sure you are starting to be able to imagine them, hopefully,

779
00:51:47,989 --> 00:51:51,293
for whatever kind of game you're working on, depending on its mechanics.

780
00:51:54,018 --> 00:52:03,982
So before I wrap up this section, I want to assure you about something that always bothers me whenever I hear a talk about the psychological predictability of human beings,

781
00:52:03,982 --> 00:52:11,425
and the way that we can use numerical measurements taken from our players to make decisions about the creative path that we should take with our games.

782
00:52:11,425 --> 00:52:13,786
These are tools, just like any other.

783
00:52:13,786 --> 00:52:21,710
And just like a knife, they can be used to peel a delicious apple or commit a horrible murder.

784
00:52:23,483 --> 00:52:26,647
It's often good to be scientific in a technical art like ours,

785
00:52:26,647 --> 00:52:31,752
but you shouldn't go any further with these techniques than your gut instincts

786
00:52:31,752 --> 00:52:36,076
as a game designer and a creative person tell you that you should go.

787
00:52:36,076 --> 00:52:40,640
What you're trying to do is to make sure that your game is landing with players

788
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,702
in the way that you intend it to land.

789
00:52:43,524 --> 00:52:48,512
You're trying to get rid of all the daft oversights that stop your game from being fun and interesting,

790
00:52:48,512 --> 00:52:54,062
while leaving in enough chewy stuff that players want to sink their teeth into your game over and over again.

791
00:52:55,876 --> 00:53:00,601
And this also applies to my whole invocation of this concept of attention.

792
00:53:00,601 --> 00:53:04,105
I'm not trying to be reductive and explain things away in terms of

793
00:53:04,105 --> 00:53:07,889
psychology and brain science. I think that would be a terrible mistake.

794
00:53:07,889 --> 00:53:12,113
This is just one more lens that we can use to look at what we're doing

795
00:53:12,113 --> 00:53:13,655
when we're designing a video game.

796
00:53:17,344 --> 00:53:19,785
So now let's get to the topic I want to close on.

797
00:53:19,785 --> 00:53:24,947
The subject of experiential video games, what they have to do with attention,

798
00:53:24,947 --> 00:53:26,688
and why I think they're important.

799
00:53:26,688 --> 00:53:30,970
I'm sure that some of you have been wondering why I haven't yet mentioned a

800
00:53:30,970 --> 00:53:31,410
concept

801
00:53:31,410 --> 00:53:35,071
that seems obviously connected to the concept of attention

802
00:53:35,071 --> 00:53:38,293
and the psychology of video games. Of course,

803
00:53:38,293 --> 00:53:40,293
I'm talking about the concept of flow.

804
00:53:41,978 --> 00:53:47,103
Now flow is, of course, the state of optimal experience described by the psychology professor

805
00:53:47,103 --> 00:53:52,046
Mike Chixentmihalyi, and it's been much discussed here at GDC over the years for the strong

806
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:53,528
ties that it has to games.

807
00:53:54,598 --> 00:53:59,223
When we're in a flow state, our attention is held and very highly focused,

808
00:53:59,223 --> 00:54:02,746
whether we're doing needlepoint or speed typing or playing triple town.

809
00:54:02,746 --> 00:54:08,232
Our attention is right where it needs to be, on the subject matter that we're engaged with,

810
00:54:08,232 --> 00:54:12,837
helping us handle the tasks at hand, while our vigilance watches out for incoming tasks

811
00:54:12,837 --> 00:54:13,958
that we're going to have to deal with.

812
00:54:14,740 --> 00:54:19,046
We lose some awareness of ourselves, of our bodies in particular,

813
00:54:19,046 --> 00:54:21,929
and we experience strange time distortion effects,

814
00:54:21,929 --> 00:54:24,572
as hours seemingly pass in minutes,

815
00:54:24,572 --> 00:54:26,875
but sometimes as moments stretch out,

816
00:54:26,875 --> 00:54:30,239
allowing us to act more rapidly than we otherwise could.

817
00:54:32,172 --> 00:54:38,196
When we're in a flow state, we're riding the boundary between mastery, where things are easy,

818
00:54:38,196 --> 00:54:41,098
and challenge, where our abilities are being tested.

819
00:54:41,098 --> 00:54:44,940
If the system's too hard, we'll get frustrated.

820
00:54:44,940 --> 00:54:47,562
If it's too easy, we lose interest.

821
00:54:47,562 --> 00:54:52,986
In either case, we drop out of the flow state, and the system has lost our attention.

822
00:54:52,986 --> 00:54:59,350
When we are in a flow state, we're acting in a system as if it was a game,

823
00:54:59,350 --> 00:55:01,991
manipulating the system towards certain goals.

824
00:55:03,245 --> 00:55:06,467
However, we wouldn't always want to call the system a game.

825
00:55:06,467 --> 00:55:11,531
Surgeons are often used as example cases of people who go into a flow state as

826
00:55:11,531 --> 00:55:12,091
they work,

827
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:16,474
and we agreed earlier that video games like Minecraft don't even have explicit

828
00:55:16,474 --> 00:55:21,297
goals, and yet millions of people, myself included, go straight into a flow state

829
00:55:21,297 --> 00:55:22,478
when they pick Minecraft up.

830
00:55:24,005 --> 00:55:29,969
So in trying to solve the puzzle of how we can go into a flow state in non-game systems,

831
00:55:29,969 --> 00:55:35,552
I finally understood how Minecraft holds my attention so completely.

832
00:55:35,552 --> 00:55:43,978
In the public debate about gamification, we've talked a lot about extrinsic and intrinsic

833
00:55:43,978 --> 00:55:44,438
goals.

834
00:55:45,325 --> 00:55:48,790
We know from educational and industrial psychology,

835
00:55:48,790 --> 00:55:50,733
going all the way back to the 1930s,

836
00:55:50,733 --> 00:55:53,917
that intrinsic goals are better motivators

837
00:55:53,917 --> 00:55:55,499
than extrinsic goals.

838
00:55:55,499 --> 00:55:59,084
It's the playing of a game for its own sake

839
00:55:59,084 --> 00:56:00,886
that holds our attention,

840
00:56:00,886 --> 00:56:02,849
not the promise of some eventual reward.

841
00:56:06,978 --> 00:56:11,219
So I realized that I create my own intrinsic goals in Minecraft.

842
00:56:11,219 --> 00:56:14,301
And this is what puts me into a flow state.

843
00:56:14,301 --> 00:56:19,943
I make a game of Minecraft by imagining a backstory where I need to stay alive

844
00:56:19,943 --> 00:56:23,264
to unlock the mysteries of my uniquely generated world.

845
00:56:23,264 --> 00:56:27,065
And in order to stay alive, I have to engage with the system of the world around me,

846
00:56:27,065 --> 00:56:29,726
exploring the environment and using the things I find in it

847
00:56:29,726 --> 00:56:32,127
to make the tools that aid me in my quest.

848
00:56:33,310 --> 00:56:36,193
However, the goals set for themselves by other people

849
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:38,915
who play inside this self-same system

850
00:56:38,915 --> 00:56:42,197
that is Minecraft might be quite different,

851
00:56:42,197 --> 00:56:45,260
like building a scale model of the USS Enterprise

852
00:56:45,260 --> 00:56:48,882
or building a flipping working 16-bit processor.

853
00:56:48,882 --> 00:56:54,847
But what's common for all of us is that we've had a profound experience of a flow state

854
00:56:54,847 --> 00:56:58,189
that was only possible because of the goal-setting attitude

855
00:56:58,189 --> 00:57:00,812
that we brought to an open system.

856
00:57:04,630 --> 00:57:09,652
This is what Csikszentmihalyi calls the autotelic experience,

857
00:57:09,652 --> 00:57:14,473
from the Latin auto, self, and telos, goal.

858
00:57:14,473 --> 00:57:17,554
Autotelic people, he says, are internally driven,

859
00:57:17,554 --> 00:57:19,914
and they exhibit a sense of purpose and curiosity.

860
00:57:19,914 --> 00:57:24,735
Because of their nature, they're more autonomous and independent,

861
00:57:24,735 --> 00:57:29,317
and they're less easily manipulated by threats or rewards.

862
00:57:29,317 --> 00:57:33,678
They love to explore systems just for the sake of exploring.

863
00:57:36,035 --> 00:57:40,538
Now, I think all human beings are autotelic to some extent,

864
00:57:40,538 --> 00:57:45,220
but our generations, the ones that have grown up playing video games,

865
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:49,443
are very lucky because we've been trained to be more autotelic

866
00:57:49,443 --> 00:57:52,705
than any other generation of humanity before us.

867
00:57:52,705 --> 00:57:56,908
The games that we've played have cultivated our curiosity

868
00:57:56,908 --> 00:58:01,471
and our independence and our ability to manipulate rich systems

869
00:58:01,471 --> 00:58:02,871
in goal-setting ways.

870
00:58:05,147 --> 00:58:18,651
I'm sure that you or people you know have had deep, rich gameplay experiences in Red Dead Redemption or Far Cry 2 or Skyrim without following the main storyline of the game at all.

871
00:58:18,651 --> 00:58:21,552
Or maybe by running pacifist playthroughs.

872
00:58:21,552 --> 00:58:26,033
This is testament to the power of the Autotelic experience.

873
00:58:28,499 --> 00:58:32,201
Now, as far as I know, Daniel Ben-Mehi first coined the term

874
00:58:32,201 --> 00:58:35,663
experiential games on his blog all the way back in 2007.

875
00:58:35,663 --> 00:58:41,105
Broadly speaking, these are games that forego explicit goals and traditional

876
00:58:41,105 --> 00:58:41,966
game compulsion loops

877
00:58:41,966 --> 00:58:45,307
in favor of systematized, open-ended,

878
00:58:45,307 --> 00:58:48,809
explorative experiences, often in pursuit

879
00:58:48,809 --> 00:58:50,590
of an artistic impact.

880
00:58:52,790 --> 00:58:56,392
Early attempts at these kinds of games and interactive art experiences

881
00:58:56,392 --> 00:59:00,174
frequently struggled to hold people's attention for very long

882
00:59:00,174 --> 00:59:01,956
compared to traditional video games,

883
00:59:01,956 --> 00:59:06,578
maybe because they had a tendency to rely on aesthetics and narrative,

884
00:59:06,578 --> 00:59:10,301
the categories that are the least effective at holding our attention.

885
00:59:11,342 --> 00:59:16,210
However, as game aesthetics and narrative elements have become more systemically interesting,

886
00:59:16,210 --> 00:59:22,100
new opportunities have opened up for experiential games because of this autotelic drive that

887
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:23,462
we all carry around with us.

888
00:59:24,524 --> 00:59:29,048
In my IndieCade talk last year, I described the way that Tale of Tales game,

889
00:59:29,048 --> 00:59:33,312
The Graveyard, which you can see in the slide, gave me the confidence

890
00:59:33,312 --> 00:59:37,456
to push through the experiential, peaceful village sequence

891
00:59:37,456 --> 00:59:41,340
in Uncharted 2, even when some of the people on our team

892
00:59:41,340 --> 00:59:44,002
didn't think this was going to be a success.

893
00:59:44,002 --> 00:59:44,903
The calm beauty of the scene...

894
00:59:48,866 --> 00:59:54,250
And the pleasure of just the simple systemic narrative elements that we scattered through it

895
00:59:54,250 --> 01:00:00,695
held people's attention for just long enough to create a powerful moment at an important point in the game.

896
01:00:01,710 --> 01:00:06,935
Players who were curious and explorative found plenty to reward their curiosity.

897
01:00:06,935 --> 01:00:10,058
And players oriented towards the ultimate goal of the game

898
01:00:10,058 --> 01:00:13,021
were able to move through the scene very quickly,

899
01:00:13,021 --> 01:00:17,205
while soaking up just enough of the calm atmosphere

900
01:00:17,205 --> 01:00:19,427
to reset the intensity of the game

901
01:00:19,427 --> 01:00:21,208
in preparation for its final act.

902
01:00:22,507 --> 01:00:24,287
And you can find my IndieCade talk online

903
01:00:24,287 --> 01:00:27,249
if you're interested to hear more about this. It's on YouTube and G4TV.

904
01:00:27,249 --> 01:00:29,530
You'll hear my anecdote about people trying to punch the NPCs.

905
01:00:29,530 --> 01:00:30,830
Video games are special

906
01:00:30,830 --> 01:00:33,051
in their opportunities for non-linearity of meaning.

907
01:00:33,051 --> 01:00:34,892
But they're not unique in this regard.

908
01:00:48,704 --> 01:00:55,269
Philosophers have thought for years that so-called linear artistic forms

909
01:00:55,269 --> 01:00:57,390
offer similar opportunities.

910
01:00:57,390 --> 01:00:59,131
In his 1962 book, The Open Work,

911
01:00:59,131 --> 01:01:02,294
the Italian author and scholar Umberto Eco,

912
01:01:02,294 --> 01:01:06,557
most famous for his novel, The Name of the Rose,

913
01:01:06,557 --> 01:01:11,020
argued, and I'm quoting from Wikipedia here, rather than from Eco himself,

914
01:01:11,020 --> 01:01:15,503
literary texts are fields of meaning

915
01:01:15,503 --> 01:01:17,284
rather than strings of meaning.

916
01:01:18,083 --> 01:01:24,767
They are understood as open, internally dynamic, and psychologically engaged fields.

917
01:01:24,767 --> 01:01:32,371
Literature, which limits one's potential understanding to a single, unequivocal line,

918
01:01:32,371 --> 01:01:35,933
the closed text, remains the least rewarding,

919
01:01:35,933 --> 01:01:41,296
while texts that are the most active between mind and society and life

920
01:01:41,296 --> 01:01:43,738
are the most lively and best.

921
01:01:46,004 --> 01:01:50,705
In other words, singularity of meaning is the enemy of art.

922
01:01:50,705 --> 01:01:54,607
Great art in all its forms is multiplicitous, systemic,

923
01:01:54,607 --> 01:01:58,728
and can have many meanings, even contradictory meanings,

924
01:01:58,728 --> 01:02:02,409
which is why the same piece of art can speak to us in different ways

925
01:02:02,409 --> 01:02:03,869
at different times in our lives.

926
01:02:03,869 --> 01:02:09,211
If we expect to find new things each time we come back to a work,

927
01:02:09,211 --> 01:02:12,412
then that in itself is a draw for our attention.

928
01:02:14,847 --> 01:02:20,669
Amy Hennig, my dear friend and Naughty Dog's creative director and head writer on the Uncharted

929
01:02:20,669 --> 01:02:28,032
series, talks about the very great value of leaving something to an audience's imagination

930
01:02:28,032 --> 01:02:33,054
in terms of the storytelling in our games, so that the individual player fills in the

931
01:02:33,054 --> 01:02:39,397
details for themselves and the experience of the game truly becomes their own even before

932
01:02:39,397 --> 01:02:41,978
they've taken an action in our interactive system.

933
01:02:43,207 --> 01:02:48,751
So to put it another way, if linear games are well-written, they're not truly linear.

934
01:02:48,751 --> 01:02:57,196
We're learning more all the time about how to devise gameplay that expresses a broad

935
01:02:57,196 --> 01:02:58,537
range of emotion.

936
01:02:58,537 --> 01:03:05,721
That's crucially important for pushing games forward as an artistic form, as Jonathan Blow's

937
01:03:05,721 --> 01:03:07,863
Braid has so ably demonstrated.

938
01:03:09,792 --> 01:03:16,295
But I worry that we have a tendency to over-focus on compulsion loops and explicit goals in the games that we make.

939
01:03:16,295 --> 01:03:20,957
And we tend to look past the emotional value, and hence the artistic value,

940
01:03:20,957 --> 01:03:25,619
brought to a game by things like nuanced aesthetics, the narrative and the social,

941
01:03:25,619 --> 01:03:30,942
and the space for autotelic self-determination created by open systems.

942
01:03:32,232 --> 01:03:38,834
In his GDC talk last year, An Apology for Roger Ebert, Brian Moriarty gave us the definition,

943
01:03:38,834 --> 01:03:43,695
Sublime art is the still evocation of the inexpressible.

944
01:03:43,695 --> 01:03:50,477
When we're trying to make games that succeed artistically, our ultimate goal is to evoke

945
01:03:50,477 --> 01:03:55,238
ideas and emotion from the player about subjects that are difficult to express.

946
01:03:56,633 --> 01:04:00,315
But as Brian suggested in his talk, and as Csikszentmihalyi himself says,

947
01:04:00,315 --> 01:04:05,276
the flow state that we enter when we're caught up in the formal parts of a game

948
01:04:05,276 --> 01:04:09,157
is almost emotionless as an essential part of its character.

949
01:04:09,157 --> 01:04:14,559
Our minds are just too busy when we're dealing with all of the rational tasks

950
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:20,560
that a game presents to allow in the subtlety of feeling that we're chasing as artists.

951
01:04:22,418 --> 01:04:29,262
But I see room for both the flow of gameplay and reflective experience in our games.

952
01:04:29,262 --> 01:04:35,565
If, from time to time in the progression of a game, we have the confidence to let the

953
01:04:35,565 --> 01:04:38,667
player just drop out of their flow state.

954
01:04:41,170 --> 01:04:46,653
As the player's attention begins to shift away from its laser focus on the goals of the game,

955
01:04:46,653 --> 01:04:50,055
whether those goals are self-created or imposed by the designer,

956
01:04:50,055 --> 01:04:54,958
then we have an opportunity to catch the player in just the right way

957
01:04:54,958 --> 01:04:59,821
with an affecting piece of music, or a view of something wonderful,

958
01:04:59,821 --> 01:05:02,723
or just a look from another character.

959
01:05:02,723 --> 01:05:07,966
And in doing so, we can create one of those powerful moments that we cherish in our favorite games.

960
01:05:08,933 --> 01:05:14,117
Have you ever stopped to watch the sunset in Minecraft or to admire a view in Uncharted?

961
01:05:14,117 --> 01:05:22,223
Think about how you are in that moment as your responsible, logical, goal-oriented mind

962
01:05:22,223 --> 01:05:27,667
gives way to the uncensored emotion of your innermost self.

963
01:05:27,667 --> 01:05:30,509
For me, this boundary...

964
01:05:31,546 --> 01:05:35,309
where the cool clarity of focused rationality

965
01:05:35,309 --> 01:05:38,872
meets the chaos and immediacy of raw emotion,

966
01:05:38,872 --> 01:05:42,034
creating in us a lived experience

967
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:46,017
that is uniquely ours in both its intellectual

968
01:05:46,017 --> 01:05:48,219
and intimate qualities,

969
01:05:48,219 --> 01:05:51,161
is the richest and most exciting aspect

970
01:05:51,161 --> 01:05:55,044
of video games as an expressive medium.

971
01:05:55,044 --> 01:05:56,865
Game designers are often terrified

972
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:59,367
to let gameplay's iron grip

973
01:05:59,367 --> 01:06:00,768
on the player's attention drop.

974
01:06:01,579 --> 01:06:03,941
for fear of losing that attention forever, I think.

975
01:06:03,941 --> 01:06:08,685
But we can see from what we've looked at today that there's no need to panic.

976
01:06:08,685 --> 01:06:13,309
If the player has come to trust you, then they'll stay with you,

977
01:06:13,309 --> 01:06:17,553
for a while at least. And we have so many tools that we can use

978
01:06:17,553 --> 01:06:20,356
to get the player's attention back again in a meaningful way

979
01:06:20,356 --> 01:06:24,139
that the biggest challenge we face will be deciding which one to choose.

980
01:06:26,976 --> 01:06:31,717
Artists from Shakespeare to David Lynch to Fermito Wader

981
01:06:31,717 --> 01:06:35,998
have understood how to shape emotion by guiding attention

982
01:06:35,998 --> 01:06:39,818
while leaving room for personal experience for years.

983
01:06:39,818 --> 01:06:45,339
And in doing so, they've impacted our lives in countless ways.

984
01:06:45,339 --> 01:06:49,780
The emotional results that Mark, Robin and Robert describe in MDA

985
01:06:49,780 --> 01:06:52,801
are the point of games.

986
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:54,181
No matter how we get there.

987
01:06:57,237 --> 01:06:59,278
And there's no one right path with this.

988
01:06:59,278 --> 01:07:02,399
We developers are free to play in this domain

989
01:07:02,399 --> 01:07:05,361
and make our own discoveries about what works for us.

990
01:07:05,361 --> 01:07:08,242
We hope that we've shown with the Uncharted games

991
01:07:08,242 --> 01:07:11,423
that the techniques of cinema can make a great mix with video

992
01:07:11,423 --> 01:07:11,744
games.

993
01:07:11,744 --> 01:07:16,706
But we mustn't lose sight of literary fiction, of poetry,

994
01:07:16,706 --> 01:07:21,088
theater, and music as vital forms of self-expression

995
01:07:21,088 --> 01:07:24,269
that we're only just beginning to synthesize effectively

996
01:07:24,269 --> 01:07:27,110
with the creative opportunities that video games present.

997
01:07:29,587 --> 01:07:32,847
There's one piece of knowledge that I'm certain we all share.

998
01:07:32,847 --> 01:07:38,249
It's that all these things, new technologies and better development practices,

999
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,770
the mechanisms and mysteries of the human mind,

1000
01:07:40,770 --> 01:07:46,771
and the great powers of curiosity and self-determination that we all have,

1001
01:07:46,771 --> 01:07:53,093
are, in video games, making a new kind of cultural form possible.

1002
01:07:53,093 --> 01:07:57,995
One that is active between mind and society and life.

1003
01:07:59,951 --> 01:08:00,679
And that's my talk.

1004
01:08:00,679 --> 01:08:01,204
Thanks very much.
