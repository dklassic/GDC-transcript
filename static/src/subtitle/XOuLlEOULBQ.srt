1
00:00:07,142 --> 00:00:09,504
What is our job as games educators today?

2
00:00:10,785 --> 00:00:13,727
A common answer to this question is to generate hireability.

3
00:00:14,448 --> 00:00:16,470
It seems like the value of game education

4
00:00:16,570 --> 00:00:18,431
hinges on our ability to integrate

5
00:00:18,511 --> 00:00:22,114
prospective game developers into an existing labor market.

6
00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:26,113
This labor market appears in our institutional meta-narratives

7
00:00:26,673 --> 00:00:30,176
and is often connected to an unchallenged set of best practices.

8
00:00:30,676 --> 00:00:35,560
Scrumming, pitching, jamming, failing early, specializing, polishing portfolios.

9
00:00:36,341 --> 00:00:40,724
In short, we prepare students for a life in which they live for video games

10
00:00:41,225 --> 00:00:44,788
in order to make a living, in which they become hireable.

11
00:00:45,935 --> 00:00:48,076
But lately we start hearing different stories.

12
00:00:48,736 --> 00:00:50,738
Games, as profitable as they are,

13
00:00:50,818 --> 00:00:53,139
are becoming an increasingly unstable industry,

14
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:56,541
and one that burns out highly talented creatives

15
00:00:56,961 --> 00:00:58,322
at a mind-boggling rate.

16
00:00:59,503 --> 00:01:02,124
Devs in so-called employment relationships

17
00:01:02,785 --> 00:01:05,186
live in the constant fear of being laid off

18
00:01:05,266 --> 00:01:08,728
after the next project if they don't collapse

19
00:01:09,789 --> 00:01:11,050
from burnout before that.

20
00:01:12,971 --> 00:01:14,011
It really starts early.

21
00:01:15,124 --> 00:01:19,770
As a highly productive student in one of my recent classes proudly wrote into their course

22
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:24,716
resume, to finish my game I had to break up with my significant other.

23
00:01:26,298 --> 00:01:31,946
The student felt they had to ditch a loved one for a BA student video game.

24
00:01:33,255 --> 00:01:38,661
This was happening in a design school, mind you, whose leading faculty pushed really hard

25
00:01:39,301 --> 00:01:42,825
for the artistic and political valency of video games in their curriculum,

26
00:01:43,626 --> 00:01:47,670
an idealism crushed under the tangible dicta of our ability.

27
00:01:49,392 --> 00:01:53,035
Couched in the provisional safety of my own precarious academic niche,

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,272
I watch the most talented students buy into and burn out inside this paradigm.

29
00:02:01,753 --> 00:02:06,394
It's a well-documented ritual starting with generous investments into the promise of a

30
00:02:06,434 --> 00:02:07,395
well-paying job.

31
00:02:08,515 --> 00:02:13,917
I see students take out horrendous loans and work multiple jobs to pursue the dream of

32
00:02:13,997 --> 00:02:15,738
becoming a video game rock star.

33
00:02:17,225 --> 00:02:19,327
Due to their passion and hard work,

34
00:02:19,687 --> 00:02:22,089
they land an internship or a junior position,

35
00:02:22,649 --> 00:02:25,712
but most of the time not in the core field of interest.

36
00:02:27,213 --> 00:02:28,974
Example, oh, you're a woman,

37
00:02:28,994 --> 00:02:30,575
you should be our community manager.

38
00:02:32,437 --> 00:02:35,859
A new report by the Higher Education Video Games Alliance,

39
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:39,622
short HEFCA, suggests that while game dev alumni

40
00:02:40,002 --> 00:02:42,705
have no problem finding a job after university,

41
00:02:43,145 --> 00:02:46,828
their job satisfaction steadily decreases over the years.

42
00:02:48,073 --> 00:02:49,774
This tends to be gendered as well.

43
00:02:50,255 --> 00:02:53,937
Women and LGBT plus folks are more likely to drop out

44
00:02:54,098 --> 00:02:54,698
more quickly.

45
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:56,099
The reason?

46
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:59,842
Rampant misogyny and other forms of discrimination,

47
00:03:00,222 --> 00:03:03,105
such as toxic assumptions about unpaid labor,

48
00:03:03,205 --> 00:03:06,427
extra advocacy work, combined with a loss of purpose.

49
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:10,450
From the perspective of institutional performance ratings,

50
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,072
we're sort of fine with that.

51
00:03:13,193 --> 00:03:15,054
The students were hireable after all.

52
00:03:18,684 --> 00:03:25,067
The problem is that the idea of hireability is based on a 1950s clichÃ© of a secure labour market.

53
00:03:25,707 --> 00:03:33,691
I remember when my nan, who held a lifetime employment under the conditions of a soaring 1950s Austrian economy,

54
00:03:34,152 --> 00:03:34,912
used to ask me,

55
00:03:36,253 --> 00:03:38,434
have you found a position yet?

56
00:03:39,714 --> 00:03:41,635
Or, in an attempt to encourage me a bit more,

57
00:03:42,115 --> 00:03:45,717
you will certainly find a position you like.

58
00:03:47,395 --> 00:03:51,940
What she meant, of course, in either of these cases was lifetime employment

59
00:03:52,941 --> 00:03:58,266
inside a secure and thriving company designed to sustain my mental and physical well-being.

60
00:03:59,127 --> 00:04:02,251
Stable salary, paid vacation and a nice Christmas bonus.

61
00:04:03,392 --> 00:04:03,993
Hireability.

62
00:04:05,775 --> 00:04:09,037
We need to face the facts and start asking other questions,

63
00:04:09,357 --> 00:04:10,237
harder questions,

64
00:04:11,198 --> 00:04:14,660
questions which don't originate in quantification,

65
00:04:15,501 --> 00:04:15,881
such as,

66
00:04:16,901 --> 00:04:19,063
how will students have a stable life

67
00:04:19,483 --> 00:04:21,744
in an industry which doesn't seem to offer one?

68
00:04:22,705 --> 00:04:25,327
How do we ensure our students will thrive

69
00:04:25,547 --> 00:04:27,348
while doing game design for a living?

70
00:04:29,529 --> 00:04:31,710
While game education certainly cannot solve

71
00:04:31,750 --> 00:04:34,512
the problems of neoliberalism in the current gig economy,

72
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,959
It can take this question to heart and formulate strategies

73
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,841
which are more versatile and sustainable in addressing our students' futures.

74
00:04:43,961 --> 00:04:46,682
I think of this challenge in terms of a question

75
00:04:47,082 --> 00:04:49,323
which I ask my students in my mind.

76
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:57,125
Did my course equip you to define your space in video games culture?

77
00:04:57,965 --> 00:05:02,807
Did you learn skills which actually allowed you to express what you want to express?

78
00:05:04,055 --> 00:05:10,000
Do these skills bring opportunities which enable you to build a sustainable life?

79
00:05:11,602 --> 00:05:12,523
But that's the future.

80
00:05:13,644 --> 00:05:14,284
Back to the now.

81
00:05:16,726 --> 00:05:22,171
In the now we face the serious challenge of how we might go about teaching such skills.

82
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:27,059
The answer I present in this talk is experimental and rudimentary.

83
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:31,983
For now, let's call it teaching games that care, or rather the making thereof.

84
00:05:32,864 --> 00:05:39,930
But here's a disclaimer. My idea of games that care is not intended to claim that it can save a structurally broken economy.

85
00:05:41,487 --> 00:05:45,748
It intends to teach students to find new contexts and consumer groups

86
00:05:46,408 --> 00:05:49,429
and be less dependent on existing markets and industry logics.

87
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:53,430
It is supposed to inspire deep connections to the real world

88
00:05:53,610 --> 00:05:57,771
by encouraging students to work on what they genuinely care about.

89
00:05:59,531 --> 00:06:01,712
I started being interested in this approach.

90
00:06:02,904 --> 00:06:05,445
while writing on my thesis on games and bereavement,

91
00:06:05,705 --> 00:06:07,105
which is now available as a book.

92
00:06:08,005 --> 00:06:10,685
In games and bereavement, I was interested in developing

93
00:06:10,945 --> 00:06:12,906
meaningful ways to represent attachment,

94
00:06:13,346 --> 00:06:15,786
loss, and grief experiences in video games.

95
00:06:16,446 --> 00:06:19,207
This interest was born from the conflict that,

96
00:06:19,847 --> 00:06:22,968
in 2011, when I started this project,

97
00:06:23,368 --> 00:06:26,708
these subjects seemed fundamental to human experience

98
00:06:27,128 --> 00:06:28,289
and absent in games.

99
00:06:29,909 --> 00:06:30,989
The stakes were personal.

100
00:06:32,095 --> 00:06:34,115
When my baby Nico died in 2004,

101
00:06:35,575 --> 00:06:37,516
I found one way of coping with this

102
00:06:37,896 --> 00:06:40,316
by rebuilding my experience in The Sims 2.

103
00:06:41,336 --> 00:06:43,477
I was able to design two young adults

104
00:06:43,677 --> 00:06:45,437
to the liking of my partner and me.

105
00:06:46,697 --> 00:06:49,518
A baby was born through the sanitary animation,

106
00:06:49,558 --> 00:06:51,898
which did nothing to simulate the hard work

107
00:06:51,938 --> 00:06:52,798
that is birth for you.

108
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:57,579
And at the point at which Nico was supposed to die,

109
00:06:57,599 --> 00:06:59,680
The Sims 2 resisted.

110
00:07:00,816 --> 00:07:02,937
It did not let me represent my experience.

111
00:07:03,677 --> 00:07:08,038
This game about life literally did not support mine.

112
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:11,799
By disabling the death of babies,

113
00:07:11,859 --> 00:07:13,780
the game symbolically erased the experience

114
00:07:13,820 --> 00:07:16,921
of thousands of other ex-parents like me,

115
00:07:17,381 --> 00:07:19,502
expressing the unspeakableness of our fate

116
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,482
through its mechanics.

117
00:07:22,382 --> 00:07:25,684
Finding mechanics which care, then, seemed crucial to me.

118
00:07:26,184 --> 00:07:27,984
And it seemed like a good idea to do so

119
00:07:28,064 --> 00:07:30,686
by collaborating with students and other bereaved mothers.

120
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,447
Parts of this project were presented at GDC17,

121
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,608
but today it's the first time that I talk

122
00:07:37,628 --> 00:07:39,449
about the didactic side.

123
00:07:40,569 --> 00:07:42,490
Before I continue, I want to note

124
00:07:42,550 --> 00:07:45,091
that teaching grief-based game design

125
00:07:45,471 --> 00:07:48,753
may appear like it's on the extreme end of what

126
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:50,213
a game design subject can be.

127
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:53,781
This is because it's such a stigmatized topic.

128
00:07:54,301 --> 00:07:58,382
To many of us, grief is as ordinary and essential as drinking water,

129
00:07:59,283 --> 00:08:01,303
and that's why I chose to work with it.

130
00:08:03,224 --> 00:08:07,886
But I want to encourage you to think of how these teaching methods

131
00:08:08,126 --> 00:08:13,028
I present in this talk might relate to what you find ordinary and essential,

132
00:08:13,768 --> 00:08:17,009
and how you might introduce that into your curriculum.

133
00:08:18,917 --> 00:08:24,139
I also want to note that the methods I used don't come out of the blue, but they have

134
00:08:24,219 --> 00:08:25,480
histories in the plural.

135
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:30,843
One of these histories is the long-standing tradition of participatory design and a small

136
00:08:30,903 --> 00:08:32,724
recent mapping to game development.

137
00:08:34,472 --> 00:08:38,479
Participatory design, especially in the Scandinavian area,

138
00:08:38,859 --> 00:08:42,145
emerged as a politically motivated methodology,

139
00:08:42,565 --> 00:08:46,251
driven by unions and workers to include end users

140
00:08:46,391 --> 00:08:49,376
in the design process of their future working environments.

141
00:08:50,793 --> 00:08:53,735
In the game development context, the importance of the user

142
00:08:53,775 --> 00:08:55,677
has been emphasized as well, especially

143
00:08:55,717 --> 00:08:57,177
in player-centric design.

144
00:08:57,698 --> 00:09:00,339
One example you see here is Tracy Fullerton's game design

145
00:09:00,379 --> 00:09:03,842
workshop, a classic, which now celebrates its fourth edition.

146
00:09:03,922 --> 00:09:04,762
Congratulations.

147
00:09:07,024 --> 00:09:08,224
In the development process.

148
00:09:09,224 --> 00:09:17,153
It is essential to many studios out there to conduct playtesting in later stages of game development to give feedback on a fully formed concept.

149
00:09:17,874 --> 00:09:20,998
However, participatory game design goes a step further.

150
00:09:21,759 --> 00:09:26,604
It insists on the inclusion of users and experience experts early on in the process.

151
00:09:27,305 --> 00:09:28,627
This can have two advantages.

152
00:09:29,227 --> 00:09:34,752
First, it grounds technology in the world of real players, real people, and their needs.

153
00:09:35,332 --> 00:09:40,357
And secondly, it lets these needs inspire new technologies and new contexts of use.

154
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:46,101
Participatory game design has been used in various settings around the world,

155
00:09:46,222 --> 00:09:50,185
but there's two examples that have had a particular impact on my work.

156
00:09:51,266 --> 00:09:55,329
These are the Deep Games Lab at Chicago's DePaul University

157
00:09:55,529 --> 00:09:57,431
and the Denmark-based Game Girl Workshop.

158
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,200
The Deep Games Lab teaches design processes

159
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:03,500
which are built on experiential resonance

160
00:10:03,921 --> 00:10:05,261
between maker and design.

161
00:10:06,001 --> 00:10:09,402
Students are taught how to work with the symbolic language

162
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:11,563
of people who have gone through difficult yet

163
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,363
common experiences like eating disorders,

164
00:10:14,403 --> 00:10:15,944
depression, or domestic violence.

165
00:10:16,744 --> 00:10:19,645
The explicit goal is to use game design as a way

166
00:10:19,725 --> 00:10:22,925
to foster a deeper understanding of these experiences

167
00:10:23,486 --> 00:10:26,927
rather than designing for quote unquote measurable purpose.

168
00:10:28,983 --> 00:10:34,206
The Game Girl Workshop is one of the earliest Europe-based feminist game-focused initiatives

169
00:10:34,346 --> 00:10:40,249
using a semi-professional all-female setup to guide girls and teenagers through a development

170
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:42,090
workshop from scratch to finish.

171
00:10:43,091 --> 00:10:48,694
A core pedagogic principle is to increase the girls' self-efficacy in a world basically

172
00:10:48,794 --> 00:10:49,935
designed against them.

173
00:10:51,227 --> 00:10:55,291
It is to encourage their voices, opinions, priorities through game making.

174
00:10:55,891 --> 00:11:01,956
And it does not expect these priorities to align or compete with common game development paradigms.

175
00:11:03,817 --> 00:11:07,260
Game development instead should make space for what is.

176
00:11:09,482 --> 00:11:13,245
By learning from these efforts, my work is part of a wider community spirit,

177
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,787
which desperately needs game development to change.

178
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:20,798
from rationalized, optimized information processing

179
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,360
to practices of care.

180
00:11:24,022 --> 00:11:26,344
This long but necessary introduction takes me

181
00:11:26,404 --> 00:11:28,266
to the agenda for the rest of this talk.

182
00:11:29,287 --> 00:11:32,090
My ambition is to give you a vertical slice

183
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:34,072
of some of the detective decisions

184
00:11:34,132 --> 00:11:36,174
that went into the teaching of Jokoi,

185
00:11:36,254 --> 00:11:38,416
which you see here, a game about grief.

186
00:11:39,895 --> 00:11:43,596
I will not go much into detail with the design elements of Jokhoi,

187
00:11:44,217 --> 00:11:46,138
the game that was produced during this course.

188
00:11:46,978 --> 00:11:51,520
Those of you who are interested in it can check it out in my previous GDC talk

189
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,001
or find the game on itch.io, in this site.

190
00:11:55,362 --> 00:11:57,843
Instead I will talk about my teaching methodology

191
00:11:57,903 --> 00:12:00,884
as a case of how care as a development skill

192
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:04,266
might be introduced into our teaching curricula.

193
00:12:06,115 --> 00:12:12,199
I will start by talking about the context of how the participatory game design was set up and who participated.

194
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:17,743
Secondly, I'll talk about how to prepare the class, or how I prepared the class,

195
00:12:17,783 --> 00:12:23,506
and how the dialogue between students and participants unfolded and impacted ideation.

196
00:12:24,856 --> 00:12:30,238
Then I moved towards usability testing and the question how to evaluate a game made with and for Grievers.

197
00:12:31,158 --> 00:12:37,861
And each of these steps involved interesting risks and challenges I will reflect on along the way and in a brief final question.

198
00:12:38,241 --> 00:12:38,801
Why care?

199
00:12:40,702 --> 00:12:42,503
About the context of this class.

200
00:12:43,643 --> 00:12:48,365
Our participants were four white women in their 30s who responded to a call

201
00:12:48,525 --> 00:12:52,686
channelled through the Austrian self-help group Regenbogen, which is German for rainbow.

202
00:12:53,861 --> 00:12:59,822
My student team was composed of white, predominantly male, BA game engineering students in their early 20s

203
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:03,743
who took the course as an elective at the Aalborg University Copenhagen.

204
00:13:04,863 --> 00:13:07,724
The course stretched over a period of three months,

205
00:13:08,444 --> 00:13:12,384
during which the students developed the game Chocoy that I mentioned before.

206
00:13:14,645 --> 00:13:19,686
When it came to the women, their motivations to join this project were political and personal.

207
00:13:20,726 --> 00:13:25,067
On a political level, they shared the hope to create awareness of pregnancy loss

208
00:13:25,087 --> 00:13:28,828
as an ordinary experience worthy of destigmatization.

209
00:13:30,169 --> 00:13:32,489
They had no particular interest in video games,

210
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:35,770
but they were enthusiastic about the outlook of being included.

211
00:13:37,671 --> 00:13:40,512
On a personal level, the women shared a hope to remember

212
00:13:40,612 --> 00:13:44,433
and celebrate their experience of motherhood, even beyond death.

213
00:13:45,733 --> 00:13:48,454
They expressed this in the way they gave their fetuses names

214
00:13:48,534 --> 00:13:49,755
and spoke of them as children.

215
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:55,722
For them, keeping in touch with the inner images of their late children was important.

216
00:13:57,644 --> 00:14:03,169
The students took the course mainly to complete their BA course credits and to create an innovative

217
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,330
game with a deep message.

218
00:14:05,011 --> 00:14:06,613
In short, the motivations differed.

219
00:14:08,341 --> 00:14:13,125
My teaching challenge would be to find a way of facilitating a conversation between these groups.

220
00:14:13,986 --> 00:14:20,831
An additional challenge was that the two groups were located in different countries and spoke different languages,

221
00:14:21,071 --> 00:14:24,074
which required cross-cultural mediation techniques.

222
00:14:26,434 --> 00:14:32,417
I found one such technique in an approach called Muse-based Game Design by Rila Khaled.

223
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:38,199
Rila suggests that dividing the roles in a design team between those who inspire the

224
00:14:38,239 --> 00:14:43,441
muses and those who create can be helpful to structure a participatory design process.

225
00:14:43,942 --> 00:14:44,762
In Rila's words,

226
00:14:46,029 --> 00:14:50,370
Muse-based game design is an experimental, empathic design approach

227
00:14:50,831 --> 00:14:55,672
foregrounding a dialogic artist-muse relationship between a game designer and a player.

228
00:14:56,352 --> 00:15:00,093
Following a user research stage focused on learning about the player,

229
00:15:00,854 --> 00:15:06,175
the designer forms idiosyncratic design constraints inspired by and relating to the player,

230
00:15:06,295 --> 00:15:08,356
which are then used to inspire ideation.

231
00:15:09,573 --> 00:15:12,495
In RILA's original pedagogic setting,

232
00:15:12,875 --> 00:15:17,718
students are the ones conducting this research stage.

233
00:15:18,398 --> 00:15:20,319
But in our intercultural setting,

234
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:24,242
it was more useful to gather Muse's data beforehand

235
00:15:24,422 --> 00:15:27,344
and provide it in a semi-processed shape

236
00:15:27,384 --> 00:15:28,624
at the beginning of the class.

237
00:15:29,905 --> 00:15:32,447
The data handed to the students included images

238
00:15:33,047 --> 00:15:35,909
and transcribed conversations of a Muse workshop

239
00:15:36,209 --> 00:15:38,210
I carried out prior to the course.

240
00:15:39,655 --> 00:15:42,196
Needless to say, this required a bit of preparation.

241
00:15:43,957 --> 00:15:47,440
So prior to the course, I ran the Muse workshop,

242
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,781
in which the women explored a single question.

243
00:15:50,882 --> 00:15:53,744
What did their relationships to their babies feel like?

244
00:15:56,125 --> 00:15:58,326
They explored this question through an imagination

245
00:15:58,386 --> 00:15:58,947
exercise.

246
00:16:00,348 --> 00:16:02,449
What if they could visit their baby on a planet?

247
00:16:05,265 --> 00:16:06,025
These are the planets.

248
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:08,005
In response to this question,

249
00:16:08,565 --> 00:16:10,666
the muses created metaphorical images

250
00:16:10,826 --> 00:16:13,147
and eventually mock-ups of their relationships,

251
00:16:13,627 --> 00:16:15,787
informative of their current grief situation.

252
00:16:17,348 --> 00:16:20,328
In other words, they started a process of symbolic modeling,

253
00:16:21,609 --> 00:16:24,849
constructing haptic worlds in which my students engaged

254
00:16:25,670 --> 00:16:27,010
over the course of the semester.

255
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:30,791
When I went about constructing teaching materials,

256
00:16:32,014 --> 00:16:36,297
I noticed in great horror the risk I had set myself up for with this method.

257
00:16:37,398 --> 00:16:42,762
I could translate and transcribe what had been said and done in the workshop, but would

258
00:16:42,802 --> 00:16:47,626
I be able to honor all the small gestures creating effective bonds between the muses

259
00:16:47,666 --> 00:16:48,186
and myself?

260
00:16:49,687 --> 00:16:55,832
All the small talk, laughs, nods, coffee breaks, and the collective sweating in a hot room

261
00:16:55,872 --> 00:17:00,996
during early July, these were things which contributed to the way the mock-ups were designed.

262
00:17:02,201 --> 00:17:03,822
Would these be lost in translation?

263
00:17:05,503 --> 00:17:08,265
Ironically, the act of writing about experience

264
00:17:08,546 --> 00:17:09,847
erased some of it.

265
00:17:11,928 --> 00:17:14,830
On the other hand, this created some speculative room

266
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:17,452
for students' engagement with these models.

267
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:22,736
What mechanics, aesthetics, and dynamics did the mock-ups invoke?

268
00:17:24,064 --> 00:17:26,345
What speculations did they inspire?

269
00:17:27,026 --> 00:17:29,267
And how did the students connect to these worlds?

270
00:17:29,788 --> 00:17:32,230
These were important questions during ideation.

271
00:17:33,290 --> 00:17:36,092
One symbol that drew the students' particular attention

272
00:17:36,193 --> 00:17:38,254
early on was a mock-up we called the cave.

273
00:17:39,175 --> 00:17:42,277
The cave was built by a woman who

274
00:17:42,317 --> 00:17:45,600
defined her setting in an excruciating amount of detail.

275
00:17:48,448 --> 00:17:53,751
The cave was composed of two layers, an inner cave and an outer cave, surrounded by an island.

276
00:17:54,592 --> 00:17:59,515
Inside the cave lived the baby, which had to be nourished by an army of playable characters,

277
00:17:59,815 --> 00:18:01,696
all of them family members and friends.

278
00:18:02,437 --> 00:18:06,779
And the goal of the cave was to make the family live in a spaceship.

279
00:18:07,620 --> 00:18:13,043
But first they needed to collaborate to make the baby grow enough to be left behind safely.

280
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:19,136
First, there was some collective enthusiasm among the students.

281
00:18:19,216 --> 00:18:22,922
This was clearly a model with mechanics, goals, a setting in place.

282
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:26,328
If the team succeeded to translate it into a game,

283
00:18:26,788 --> 00:18:30,855
wasn't that a rock-solid way to express authentic grief experience?

284
00:18:33,191 --> 00:18:36,894
The students created a prototype and added features,

285
00:18:37,714 --> 00:18:41,156
multiple playable characters, multi-layer level design,

286
00:18:41,457 --> 00:18:44,679
customizable audio and lighting, lock and key puzzles,

287
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:47,161
shape-shifting, feeding and holding mechanics,

288
00:18:47,361 --> 00:18:50,303
an atmosphere which conveyed being in an eternal space.

289
00:18:51,003 --> 00:18:52,644
Oh, and what if you could build the spaceship?

290
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:55,927
The feature list grew and grew and grew,

291
00:18:56,267 --> 00:18:59,389
and so did the doubts as to whether this could possibly

292
00:18:59,449 --> 00:19:02,231
be achieved within the constraint of a three-month project.

293
00:19:03,454 --> 00:19:07,165
At the same time, leaving out the slightest detail from the mock-up,

294
00:19:07,425 --> 00:19:10,594
wouldn't that necessarily mean misrepresenting the women?

295
00:19:12,648 --> 00:19:17,270
This was a good moment to step back a bit and remember the laws and limitations of representation.

296
00:19:18,131 --> 00:19:26,155
According to British media scholar Stuart Hall, representation does not reflect reality, it constructs it.

297
00:19:26,915 --> 00:19:34,019
It is not outside the event, not after the event, but within the event itself. It is constitutive of it.

298
00:19:35,619 --> 00:19:40,822
This means it is virtually impossible to represent truth, not even through engineering.

299
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,382
For my students, this meant learning to embrace their own interpretations of the planet mock-ups.

300
00:19:47,843 --> 00:19:51,705
What did they see and feel and understand about these mock-ups?

301
00:19:52,205 --> 00:19:55,147
What constructed their genuine truth about it?

302
00:19:56,128 --> 00:19:59,750
This insistence on embracing what personally speaks to you

303
00:20:00,190 --> 00:20:04,473
is something I learned from Doris Rusch's work on symbolic game design

304
00:20:04,493 --> 00:20:06,654
in her insightful book, Making Deep Games.

305
00:20:07,805 --> 00:20:14,508
Doris recommends to rely on the developer's personal symbols and associations when creating games about emotional subjects.

306
00:20:15,569 --> 00:20:19,931
I would add that this is especially important in participatory settings.

307
00:20:20,472 --> 00:20:25,934
Rather than overwriting the statement of your partner by trying to represent them truly,

308
00:20:26,795 --> 00:20:30,257
use your own different words to create a genuine response.

309
00:20:31,417 --> 00:20:32,418
Use your broken words.

310
00:20:33,338 --> 00:20:36,600
Remember, being vulnerable is a game development skill.

311
00:20:37,867 --> 00:20:40,613
When taking their own perspective seriously,

312
00:20:40,633 --> 00:20:44,843
the students started identifying symbols in the mockups

313
00:20:45,424 --> 00:20:47,489
that interested them more than others.

314
00:20:49,156 --> 00:20:52,759
They also started seeing blind spots in the women's conversations,

315
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:55,280
which were essential for understanding their grief.

316
00:20:56,021 --> 00:21:00,144
For instance, the women had taken a perspective of survivorship

317
00:21:00,284 --> 00:21:01,245
rather than grief.

318
00:21:01,965 --> 00:21:04,647
Death was more of an unspoken circumstance,

319
00:21:04,787 --> 00:21:07,729
framing the wish to stay connected to their babies.

320
00:21:09,139 --> 00:21:12,720
To honor this reality, the students decided to model loss

321
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:14,300
in Jocko's control scheme.

322
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:17,741
In the game, the player first builds up a connection

323
00:21:17,861 --> 00:21:19,982
between a mother sheep and her lamb

324
00:21:20,382 --> 00:21:23,022
through a shared control, that is the left mouse button.

325
00:21:24,643 --> 00:21:26,883
After the lamb is lost in an earthquake,

326
00:21:27,503 --> 00:21:29,944
the button which used to facilitate childcare

327
00:21:29,964 --> 00:21:31,124
is no longer available.

328
00:21:31,764 --> 00:21:34,565
This is supposed to make players feel a sense of loss

329
00:21:34,625 --> 00:21:37,766
on the physical, on the haptic level of gameplay rituals.

330
00:21:39,953 --> 00:21:45,078
One of the most daunting questions was how to teach suitable methods for evaluating Chalkoi.

331
00:21:45,618 --> 00:21:51,063
I decided to let the students figure it out by themselves first, which led to some exciting frustrations.

332
00:21:53,105 --> 00:22:03,215
For the first iteration of the game, the students decided to conduct usability tests with fellow university colleagues using quantitative questionnaires.

333
00:22:04,209 --> 00:22:09,493
Their main concern was functionality, which they interestingly divided into two parts.

334
00:22:10,134 --> 00:22:14,758
First, did the players know what to do? And secondly, did the players know what to feel?

335
00:22:18,402 --> 00:22:22,005
While the first part returned clear results, the second part,

336
00:22:22,466 --> 00:22:26,649
did the players feel the right thing, produced very messy data.

337
00:22:27,858 --> 00:22:36,025
The playtesters seemed incapable of identifying their emotions by choosing the correct options

338
00:22:36,065 --> 00:22:36,946
in the questionnaire.

339
00:22:37,726 --> 00:22:42,631
This uncertainty confused and frustrated our students.

340
00:22:43,852 --> 00:22:46,634
It took some work to unpack the root of their frustration.

341
00:22:47,695 --> 00:22:52,759
As it turned out, the questionnaire had built on a common myth in effective engineering.

342
00:22:53,832 --> 00:22:59,762
the idea that developers can engineer user emotions by making correct design choices.

343
00:23:00,484 --> 00:23:07,136
In this paradigm, an information unit is triggered in a user when they interact with technology.

344
00:23:08,996 --> 00:23:14,280
This myth is summarized in the brilliant research of Kirsten Boehner and colleagues who write,

345
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:19,984
in effective computing, affect is often taken to be another kind of information.

346
00:23:20,484 --> 00:23:26,569
Discrete units or states internal to an individual that can be transmitted in a loss-free manner

347
00:23:26,649 --> 00:23:30,331
from people to computational systems and back.

348
00:23:32,138 --> 00:23:37,523
Of course, this is a myth which suits engineers because it translates complex emotion into

349
00:23:37,603 --> 00:23:39,444
quantifiable information units.

350
00:23:40,065 --> 00:23:45,150
But scientifically speaking, there is not much evidence that that's how emotion works.

351
00:23:46,231 --> 00:23:51,535
Instead, what the researchers suggest is that emotion is more like a web of messy interactions

352
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:53,978
rather than information units.

353
00:23:54,918 --> 00:23:55,839
For my students...

354
00:23:56,967 --> 00:24:02,174
What kind of UX methods were out there to measure emotion as interaction?

355
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:04,778
Spoilers, very few.

356
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:09,704
We ended up with a method called cultural probes.

357
00:24:11,268 --> 00:24:16,012
This method was first used in the context of urban design by Bill Gaver and colleagues.

358
00:24:16,632 --> 00:24:22,937
And cultural probes, for those who don't know them, are small activity packs given to users

359
00:24:23,098 --> 00:24:25,640
with the hope for inspirational feedback.

360
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:31,705
The package is handed over in a little ritual and after that the user engages with the contents

361
00:24:32,085 --> 00:24:35,908
as long as they want and returns them at their own pace.

362
00:24:37,059 --> 00:24:43,263
In most cases, probes are used as a way to establish a connection with unknown research participants.

363
00:24:44,023 --> 00:24:50,607
But in our case, it served as a tool for reconnecting and testing the second iteration of the game with our muses.

364
00:24:51,388 --> 00:24:55,810
The package contained postcards, the game prototype, and a personalized scrapbook.

365
00:24:59,274 --> 00:25:02,216
These materials were supposed to invite the muses

366
00:25:02,276 --> 00:25:05,099
to think about the workshop, the game prototype,

367
00:25:05,179 --> 00:25:06,960
and their mother-child relationship

368
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:08,481
in their current situation.

369
00:25:10,263 --> 00:25:11,944
On the day the probes were launched,

370
00:25:12,304 --> 00:25:14,466
the disadvantages of this loose method

371
00:25:14,526 --> 00:25:15,887
became relatively clear.

372
00:25:16,588 --> 00:25:19,270
Two of the four muses had to cancel the ritual

373
00:25:19,650 --> 00:25:22,072
and then had technical issues with the game.

374
00:25:23,213 --> 00:25:26,616
Since other probe contents depended on playing the game,

375
00:25:26,796 --> 00:25:28,257
they had to be returned blank.

376
00:25:29,574 --> 00:25:35,558
However, the probes which were returned were of great value for the polishing stage of chocoy.

377
00:25:36,218 --> 00:25:42,382
By now, the students had learned that the muses were supposed to inspire rather than dictate the process,

378
00:25:43,082 --> 00:25:48,545
and the probes offered additional support in crafting an appropriate atmosphere and feel of chocoy.

379
00:25:51,434 --> 00:25:57,097
Overall, what the students had learned from exploring quantitative versus speculative UX methods

380
00:25:57,177 --> 00:26:03,380
was the value of associative ephemeral feedback, which was less quantifiable, but more rich.

381
00:26:05,001 --> 00:26:06,341
So, why care?

382
00:26:08,062 --> 00:26:15,386
The processes, tools, and learnings I've discussed in this talk are in many ways a lesson of care through engineering.

383
00:26:16,689 --> 00:26:19,691
Guiding my students through a development dialogue with Grievers

384
00:26:19,751 --> 00:26:24,494
was a way of confronting some basic myths in video game engineering

385
00:26:25,054 --> 00:26:29,537
and updating them to respect the real world and each other.

386
00:26:30,918 --> 00:26:34,099
It is important that one source of respect

387
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:36,501
is the respect for one's own vision.

388
00:26:38,082 --> 00:26:40,983
Games that care do not simply care about players

389
00:26:41,624 --> 00:26:43,185
or in-game representations.

390
00:26:43,545 --> 00:26:44,966
They care about those who make them.

391
00:26:46,211 --> 00:26:50,535
They commit to decisions which resonate with and validate creators.

392
00:26:52,176 --> 00:26:56,661
Games that care cannot promise my students to find a stable life inside a troubled economy.

393
00:26:56,861 --> 00:27:00,284
It cannot prevent them from breaking up over a video game course.

394
00:27:01,085 --> 00:27:04,948
It can inspire the choice to develop games they care about.

395
00:27:05,649 --> 00:27:11,374
And this may lay the foundation for a more full, potentially interesting work life.

396
00:27:13,420 --> 00:27:15,261
Months after the end of the project,

397
00:27:16,181 --> 00:27:18,582
one of the participants asked me to present the game

398
00:27:19,223 --> 00:27:22,364
at a self-help group networking event in Vienna.

399
00:27:23,605 --> 00:27:24,685
Strolling through the room,

400
00:27:24,925 --> 00:27:27,426
I noticed a heavy photo album displayed

401
00:27:27,567 --> 00:27:29,347
near the entrance of the group's office.

402
00:27:30,528 --> 00:27:32,589
When casually flipping through the pages,

403
00:27:32,849 --> 00:27:36,591
I stumbled over a section called Our Morning Game,

404
00:27:37,952 --> 00:27:40,053
which contained two photographs from the project.

405
00:27:40,909 --> 00:27:45,671
The images were carefully arranged and glued on this thick, dark blue paper.

406
00:27:47,012 --> 00:27:48,973
And one of them showed a still from the game,

407
00:27:49,233 --> 00:27:53,114
the other one displayed two of the muses looking over my shoulder

408
00:27:53,194 --> 00:27:54,635
as we were playing the game.

409
00:27:55,375 --> 00:27:57,496
I cannot remember having this photo taken.

410
00:27:59,157 --> 00:28:02,378
This photo album reminded me of the real purpose of this course.

411
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:06,830
By including a group of muses into a BA game development course,

412
00:28:06,930 --> 00:28:11,213
we had incidentally created a memorial technology for them,

413
00:28:12,673 --> 00:28:15,275
which they were both keen on showing off to others

414
00:28:15,455 --> 00:28:16,955
and saving as a cherished memory.

415
00:28:19,337 --> 00:28:22,018
By going through the process of careful engineering,

416
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:26,420
the students had helped found this entirely new user context

417
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:28,261
of grief-based development

418
00:28:28,481 --> 00:28:32,343
and contributed to a meaningful dialogue around a stigmatized subject.

419
00:28:34,049 --> 00:28:38,973
My job as a games educator then was to walk with them a bit of the way

420
00:28:39,154 --> 00:28:43,278
and watch them grow into complex, reflective makers of things.

421
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:49,384
I would like to thank Ida Toft and Simon Nilsson for helping me develop this talk,

422
00:28:49,684 --> 00:28:50,645
and thank you for listening.
