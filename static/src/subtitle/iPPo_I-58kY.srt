00:00:05,745 --> 00:00:08,366
Welcome to Loot Boxes, Legal Pitfalls and Loopholes.

2
00:00:09,467 --> 00:00:10,427
My name is Will Bucher.

3
00:00:10,948 --> 00:00:13,629
I'm an IP litigator for a law firm, Debevoise & Plimpton,

4
00:00:13,649 --> 00:00:14,349
in New York City.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:17,771
That's a fancy way of saying I help media companies, mostly

6
00:00:17,811 --> 00:00:19,452
video game companies, when they get sued.

7
00:00:19,472 --> 00:00:22,654
And then I also spend my days helping

8
00:00:22,674 --> 00:00:25,395
those companies avoid situations that might get them sued.

9
00:00:26,896 --> 00:00:29,818
Today, we're going to be talking about regulation of loot boxes,

10
00:00:29,838 --> 00:00:33,040
and we're going to focus on three regions, the United

11
00:00:33,080 --> 00:00:35,181
States, the European Union, and China.

12
00:00:36,387 --> 00:00:38,490
And I'm going to be talking to you about where there are

13
00:00:38,530 --> 00:00:41,274
regulations, and in the countries and regions where

14
00:00:41,314 --> 00:00:44,037
there are regulations, what you need to know about them,

15
00:00:44,258 --> 00:00:46,521
and what you need to do to modify your game so that you

16
00:00:46,541 --> 00:00:47,683
can release in that jurisdiction.

17
00:00:48,763 --> 00:00:50,184
This is a business and marketing talk,

18
00:00:50,484 --> 00:00:51,985
and so for the first 27 minutes

19
00:00:52,025 --> 00:00:53,346
of this half an hour presentation,

20
00:00:53,726 --> 00:00:55,266
that's gonna be focused on the rules

21
00:00:55,667 --> 00:00:56,687
and how you can avoid them.

22
00:00:57,467 --> 00:00:58,548
For the last three minutes,

23
00:00:58,648 --> 00:01:00,909
I will talk a little bit about, as a community,

24
00:01:00,969 --> 00:01:02,670
how we ethically wanna use loot boxes,

25
00:01:03,110 --> 00:01:05,411
but the focus of today's presentation is on the rules,

26
00:01:05,431 --> 00:01:07,132
because I wanna give you the tools

27
00:01:07,532 --> 00:01:09,093
and let you decide how you wanna use them.

28
00:01:11,114 --> 00:01:13,535
Before we can start talking about loot boxes,

29
00:01:14,615 --> 00:01:16,896
we have to get on the same page about what a loot box is.

30
00:01:18,233 --> 00:01:21,615
And I think that question is a little harder than it appears at first.

31
00:01:22,775 --> 00:01:26,937
Most of us have an idea of what a loot box is in our mind.

32
00:01:27,177 --> 00:01:31,519
We might think of the stereotypical, you pay money or some green gems for a box

33
00:01:31,559 --> 00:01:32,840
that has some randomized items.

34
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:37,922
But the truth is, there's a lot of chance involved in everything we do in life.

35
00:01:38,643 --> 00:01:41,304
And I could argue that anything on this screen is a loot box.

36
00:01:42,084 --> 00:01:43,725
I'm not going to go through each of these items,

37
00:01:43,805 --> 00:01:46,145
but I want to point out a couple of the items that

38
00:01:46,165 --> 00:01:46,866
are on this screen.

39
00:01:47,466 --> 00:01:48,806
In the middle there, you see just sort

40
00:01:48,826 --> 00:01:50,387
of a procedurally generated monster.

41
00:01:50,667 --> 00:01:52,648
We've had these in games for decades.

42
00:01:53,648 --> 00:01:56,329
And the mechanics are actually very similar to a loot box.

43
00:01:56,669 --> 00:01:58,770
The player gets a random assortment of items.

44
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:00,991
Most of the time, those items are bad.

45
00:02:01,211 --> 00:02:02,391
Sometimes they're really good.

46
00:02:02,411 --> 00:02:05,992
And so there's some similarities there.

47
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:08,133
Loot boxes really aren't that different from something

48
00:02:08,153 --> 00:02:09,353
we've been doing for a long time.

49
00:02:10,695 --> 00:02:12,135
What about that last example, right?

50
00:02:12,575 --> 00:02:14,816
I call a car a loot box, right?

51
00:02:14,836 --> 00:02:17,697
Let's say I invest in Bitcoin and I hold all that Bitcoin

52
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,678
until I can afford my Lambo and I go to the dealership

53
00:02:20,978 --> 00:02:21,858
and the dealer says to me,

54
00:02:21,878 --> 00:02:23,119
do you want the extended warranty?

55
00:02:23,439 --> 00:02:25,039
And I say, no, I wanna save that money

56
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:26,300
to invest in more Bitcoin.

57
00:02:26,840 --> 00:02:29,861
And 366 days later, my drive train blows out.

58
00:02:30,461 --> 00:02:31,701
I'm out half a million bucks.

59
00:02:32,422 --> 00:02:33,742
But no one is trying to say that

60
00:02:34,122 --> 00:02:35,723
I have to take the extended warranty.

61
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:37,703
No one's trying to regulate that practice,

62
00:02:37,743 --> 00:02:39,424
but we face chance in everything we do.

63
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:43,080
And because it's so hard to define what a loot box is,

64
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:46,401
the answer to what a loot box is in today's presentation

65
00:02:46,481 --> 00:02:48,222
is it depends on the regulator.

66
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:52,503
We see regulators governing loot boxes in different ways.

67
00:02:53,243 --> 00:02:54,543
And that's because I don't really

68
00:02:54,583 --> 00:02:57,764
think loot boxes are a problem in the game development

69
00:02:57,804 --> 00:02:58,244
industry.

70
00:02:58,604 --> 00:03:01,125
But I do think some loot boxes are

71
00:03:01,165 --> 00:03:03,345
symbolic of some very real issues we face.

72
00:03:04,884 --> 00:03:07,008
I think some loot boxes create compulsion loops.

73
00:03:07,469 --> 00:03:11,197
These are skinner box mechanics that keep players playing much longer than they actually

74
00:03:11,217 --> 00:03:11,658
want to play.

75
00:03:12,861 --> 00:03:15,083
Some loot boxes are symbolic of pay-to-win mechanics,

76
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,283
where players feel like they're not

77
00:03:16,303 --> 00:03:18,005
being rewarded for their time or their skill,

78
00:03:18,045 --> 00:03:19,125
but just the money they put in.

79
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:22,668
Some loot boxes are used in outright fraud,

80
00:03:23,569 --> 00:03:26,010
and a lot of loot boxes aren't transparent.

81
00:03:26,311 --> 00:03:29,293
It's not clear to the user what they're going to get

82
00:03:29,333 --> 00:03:30,253
and what their odds are.

83
00:03:30,273 --> 00:03:32,775
And so when we see loot boxes regulated,

84
00:03:32,855 --> 00:03:35,417
we actually see them targeting these four other practices.

85
00:03:36,895 --> 00:03:38,657
So with that, let's start with the United States.

86
00:03:39,357 --> 00:03:41,339
Now, the United States gets a reputation

87
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:44,221
as a country where corporations make all the rules

88
00:03:44,382 --> 00:03:45,703
and there's no consumer protection.

89
00:03:46,303 --> 00:03:48,765
And in the case of loot boxes, that's absolutely right.

90
00:03:49,546 --> 00:03:52,388
There is no government organization, no agency,

91
00:03:52,749 --> 00:03:55,911
none of the 50 states that place any formal rules

92
00:03:56,251 --> 00:03:57,372
on the use of loot boxes.

93
00:03:58,373 --> 00:03:59,654
But there actually are some rules

94
00:03:59,694 --> 00:04:01,456
on the use of loot boxes in the United States,

95
00:04:01,476 --> 00:04:02,717
and those come from private companies.

96
00:04:03,443 --> 00:04:06,405
Those companies are the ESRB, that's the ratings organization

97
00:04:06,445 --> 00:04:09,266
here in the United States, and Apple through the App Store.

98
00:04:09,306 --> 00:04:12,048
If you have a mobile game that you're selling on iOS devices,

99
00:04:12,649 --> 00:04:14,330
Apple has rules you're going to have to comply with.

100
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:16,471
I'll put a little asterisk here.

101
00:04:16,771 --> 00:04:19,193
That doesn't mean you can just commit outright fraud.

102
00:04:19,773 --> 00:04:22,475
If you're lying to your consumers, that's illegal.

103
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,717
And that's been illegal for over a century, centuries,

104
00:04:25,897 --> 00:04:26,697
very long time.

105
00:04:26,717 --> 00:04:30,420
So don't use this as an excuse to do otherwise illegal things.

106
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:32,541
But there's no specific loot box regulation.

107
00:04:34,065 --> 00:04:36,086
So let's talk about those private company rules.

108
00:04:36,966 --> 00:04:41,309
So for Apple, you must disclose the odds by item type.

109
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:44,131
And Apple defines loot boxes as mechanisms

110
00:04:44,151 --> 00:04:46,632
that provide randomized virtual items for purchase.

111
00:04:47,653 --> 00:04:49,874
So Apple's sort of, there's three requirements

112
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,015
to be in the loot box bucket.

113
00:04:51,655 --> 00:04:54,457
Has to be virtual item, has to be randomized,

114
00:04:54,537 --> 00:04:55,597
and has to be for purchase.

115
00:04:56,258 --> 00:04:57,478
I think that sort of lines up

116
00:04:57,518 --> 00:04:59,320
with most of our notions of loot boxes.

117
00:05:01,043 --> 00:05:02,864
And when I say disclosed by item type,

118
00:05:03,585 --> 00:05:05,647
what I mean by that is think of sort of the classic game

119
00:05:05,667 --> 00:05:07,348
that has a common item, rare item,

120
00:05:07,468 --> 00:05:08,969
an epic item, and a legendary item.

121
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:10,331
That's what I mean by type.

122
00:05:10,471 --> 00:05:12,592
You don't have to list every single item

123
00:05:12,993 --> 00:05:14,694
and the odds of getting each and every item,

124
00:05:15,135 --> 00:05:16,916
but you have to list them by categories

125
00:05:17,036 --> 00:05:19,078
when you're selling on the App Store.

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,500
What about ESRB?

127
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,242
How does the ratings organization define loot boxes?

128
00:05:24,462 --> 00:05:25,303
Well, they sort of don't.

129
00:05:25,783 --> 00:05:28,366
They lump loot boxes in with any in-game purchase.

130
00:05:29,907 --> 00:05:34,589
And the requirement for ESRB is that you include an in-game purchases label underneath your

131
00:05:34,629 --> 00:05:34,890
rating.

132
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,511
I put an example up there in the lower right-hand corner.

133
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,532
That's what the in-game purchases tab looks like.

134
00:05:40,952 --> 00:05:42,513
And that's an effort for transparency.

135
00:05:43,574 --> 00:05:45,475
The people who use ratings most are parents.

136
00:05:45,855 --> 00:05:49,677
And what parents care most about is how much is their child going to spend in the game.

137
00:05:50,117 --> 00:05:53,558
And they want to know if their child is going to spend more money.

138
00:05:53,819 --> 00:05:57,460
They don't really care that it's in the format of a loot box or a randomized capacity.

139
00:05:59,998 --> 00:06:01,599
So now I'm going to break us into a hypothetical.

140
00:06:01,819 --> 00:06:05,141
I find it's easier to think about these ideas in a context

141
00:06:05,181 --> 00:06:08,103
that might be more similar to the one you would face in your

142
00:06:08,123 --> 00:06:09,844
own company as a developer or publisher.

143
00:06:10,224 --> 00:06:11,805
It's not going to be particularly complicated.

144
00:06:12,265 --> 00:06:14,926
But in our hypothetical today, we have a game developer,

145
00:06:14,966 --> 00:06:17,688
ShadyCorp, and they're releasing a game, Drawn Out

146
00:06:17,748 --> 00:06:21,530
Chess, and this is a classic game of chess, but it's

147
00:06:21,690 --> 00:06:24,812
monetized by selling skins, specifically selling skins

148
00:06:24,832 --> 00:06:25,612
through loot boxes.

149
00:06:26,553 --> 00:06:28,635
They release the games with no disclosures,

150
00:06:28,795 --> 00:06:30,356
no consideration of the regulations.

151
00:06:31,077 --> 00:06:33,078
And a month later, an employee spots the issue.

152
00:06:33,699 --> 00:06:34,619
This actually happens a lot.

153
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:37,141
People realize after the fact they're doing something wrong.

154
00:06:37,802 --> 00:06:38,502
And the question is,

155
00:06:38,642 --> 00:06:40,844
what does the developer do here as a company?

156
00:06:42,745 --> 00:06:43,906
Let's start with ESRB.

157
00:06:45,087 --> 00:06:46,688
What does Drawn Out Chess have to do

158
00:06:46,728 --> 00:06:47,769
to comply with the ratings?

159
00:06:48,149 --> 00:06:49,631
Well, if they're ESRB rated,

160
00:06:49,911 --> 00:06:51,152
they have to include that sticker.

161
00:06:51,732 --> 00:06:52,873
But in my hypothetical,

162
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:55,615
this game is actually only being released on Steam and iOS.

163
00:06:56,797 --> 00:06:59,557
And what that means is they don't need an ESRB rating at all.

164
00:07:00,457 --> 00:07:03,538
Most games published today are not rated by the ESRB

165
00:07:04,038 --> 00:07:06,639
because neither Steam nor the App Store

166
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:07,899
require that the games be rated.

167
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,760
Okay, so what about for Apple?

168
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:13,680
Well, for Apple, there needs to be a disclosure

169
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,321
by item type like I talked about.

170
00:07:15,341 --> 00:07:18,581
So that means ShadyCorp needs to divide their items

171
00:07:18,621 --> 00:07:20,942
into categories and list those percentage odds

172
00:07:20,982 --> 00:07:21,762
for the players.

173
00:07:22,882 --> 00:07:24,843
They can't actually formally backtrack.

174
00:07:25,767 --> 00:07:28,628
Apple says that the disclosure has to be before the purchase.

175
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,029
So there's actually no way to become compliant here.

176
00:07:31,509 --> 00:07:33,230
And somewhat frustratingly, Apple

177
00:07:33,270 --> 00:07:35,631
doesn't have formal rules for what you do when you mess up.

178
00:07:36,891 --> 00:07:39,733
So my best advice to ShadyCorp here would be fix the game,

179
00:07:40,033 --> 00:07:42,474
start disclosing in advance, and then do nothing else.

180
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:45,975
And then if Apple comes talking to you, apologize,

181
00:07:46,075 --> 00:07:48,016
negotiate with them, work out a solution.

182
00:07:48,776 --> 00:07:50,617
But there's actually no formal process

183
00:07:50,657 --> 00:07:51,898
for how to remedy a violation.

184
00:07:54,722 --> 00:07:56,304
Okay, here are some takeaways.

185
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,746
I know it's sometimes helpful to sort of have bullet points.

186
00:07:58,826 --> 00:08:00,387
Feel free to take photos of these slides.

187
00:08:00,807 --> 00:08:05,231
Takeaways for US regulation are ESRB requires disclosure,

188
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:07,613
but there's no requirement that your game

189
00:08:08,274 --> 00:08:09,955
actually have an ESRB rating

190
00:08:10,336 --> 00:08:12,137
for most online sale platforms.

191
00:08:13,018 --> 00:08:15,400
All iOS games must disclose odds by item type.

192
00:08:16,221 --> 00:08:18,183
That disclosure must be prior to purchase.

193
00:08:19,023 --> 00:08:20,945
And there's no regulation on loot boxes,

194
00:08:21,105 --> 00:08:22,807
but that doesn't mean other laws don't apply.

195
00:08:26,433 --> 00:08:27,494
So now let's talk about the EU.

196
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,397
So in the EU right now, there's country-specific regulation.

197
00:08:31,938 --> 00:08:33,419
That means every country in the EU

198
00:08:33,439 --> 00:08:34,840
gets to make up their own decision.

199
00:08:35,561 --> 00:08:38,102
Some countries, Germany, France, even PEGI,

200
00:08:38,143 --> 00:08:40,644
which is the equivalent of the ESRB in the EU,

201
00:08:41,345 --> 00:08:43,807
have called for EU-wide regulation,

202
00:08:44,367 --> 00:08:45,628
but right now we haven't seen any of it.

203
00:08:46,529 --> 00:08:48,831
So that means right now, other than two countries,

204
00:08:49,131 --> 00:08:50,812
you can do whatever you want in the EU,

205
00:08:50,932 --> 00:08:52,073
just like in the United States.

206
00:08:53,467 --> 00:08:56,510
The two countries that have rules are Belgium and Holland.

207
00:08:57,530 --> 00:09:00,353
In Belgium, it's illegal to have any acquirable item

208
00:09:00,773 --> 00:09:01,874
where chance is involved.

209
00:09:02,354 --> 00:09:05,617
So Belgium defines loot boxes as the purchase with real money

210
00:09:06,918 --> 00:09:08,439
or with paid virtual currency.

211
00:09:08,479 --> 00:09:10,560
That's sort of like the green gems, the premium currency

212
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,243
in your games, and where chance is involved.

213
00:09:13,543 --> 00:09:15,264
So you can sell items directly to players,

214
00:09:15,524 --> 00:09:18,306
but you can't sell these sort of randomized loot boxes.

215
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:21,422
Holland is actually a little more permissive.

216
00:09:22,143 --> 00:09:24,685
Holland makes it illegal where the item is

217
00:09:24,745 --> 00:09:27,107
acquirable with real money, where there's

218
00:09:27,167 --> 00:09:30,230
chance involved, and where the final prize is transferable.

219
00:09:31,491 --> 00:09:33,253
So you actually have some more options in Holland.

220
00:09:33,613 --> 00:09:35,255
Oftentimes, the two countries get lumped together.

221
00:09:35,515 --> 00:09:36,756
But I think it's actually much easier

222
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:38,638
to operate in Holland than it is in Belgium.

223
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:41,741
So we'll continue our hypothetical.

224
00:09:42,201 --> 00:09:45,004
Shady Corp expands its drawn-out chess offerings to Europe.

225
00:09:45,584 --> 00:09:46,745
What do they need to do and where?

226
00:09:47,909 --> 00:09:49,490
Well, the answer for most countries is simple.

227
00:09:50,191 --> 00:09:51,072
They don't need to do anything.

228
00:09:53,314 --> 00:09:58,679
For Belgium, the answer is they probably need to put a geofence on the purchase of their

229
00:09:58,699 --> 00:10:00,520
loot boxes.

230
00:10:00,540 --> 00:10:04,884
They can publish their game, but they can't have those purchasable loot boxes in the game.

231
00:10:06,286 --> 00:10:08,228
For Holland, ShadyCorp has another option.

232
00:10:08,428 --> 00:10:10,610
They could either geofence the purchase of the loot box.

233
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,586
Or they could prohibit players who have IP addresses in Holland from transferring their

234
00:10:16,646 --> 00:10:16,926
items.

235
00:10:17,848 --> 00:10:22,153
So you could still have those loot boxes in your game as long as the player can't transfer.

236
00:10:22,554 --> 00:10:27,160
And oftentimes it's more profitable to restrict the transfer of the items after the fact than

237
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,982
to restrict the outlight purchase of loot boxes.

238
00:10:30,535 --> 00:10:34,039
I think what these different regulations highlight, and this may become more important in the

239
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,205
future if we see other jurisdictions implementing regulations, and this is my third bullet

240
00:10:39,245 --> 00:10:43,430
point on these takeaways here, is that when you as a developer or publisher are building

241
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:49,417
your game, you want to make sure every feature of your game can be toggled on and off, or

242
00:10:49,477 --> 00:10:51,199
at least every monetization feature.

243
00:10:52,119 --> 00:10:54,600
Because if you're in a position where you can't turn off

244
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:56,501
the sale of loot boxes, then that

245
00:10:56,561 --> 00:10:58,642
means you just can't sell your game at all in these countries.

246
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:00,582
You're limiting yourself from a market that

247
00:11:00,642 --> 00:11:02,823
might still be profitable despite the regulations.

248
00:11:03,604 --> 00:11:05,264
So as you're building your game, build

249
00:11:05,304 --> 00:11:06,865
with these considerations in mind

250
00:11:07,165 --> 00:11:08,806
that there are rules that are different by country

251
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:10,666
and that those rules may change over time.

252
00:11:11,627 --> 00:11:13,628
Other big takeaways are, in Holland, you have a choice.

253
00:11:13,728 --> 00:11:16,169
You can restrict the transfer or the sale of loot boxes.

254
00:11:16,949 --> 00:11:19,670
In Belgium, you have to restrict the sale of randomized items

255
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:20,250
for purchase.

256
00:11:21,464 --> 00:11:25,426
And then sort of my final point is I've seen these calls for EU-wide regulation.

257
00:11:25,446 --> 00:11:30,668
I don't expect it to happen soon, although you ask 100 lawyers and you get 100 different

258
00:11:30,708 --> 00:11:31,329
opinions on that.

259
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:38,552
So so far, the sort of takeaway has been there's not a lot of regulation and it's pretty easy

260
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:39,172
to get around it.

261
00:11:40,393 --> 00:11:41,593
China is sort of a different story.

262
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:47,163
In China, loot boxes are regulated by two different organizations, one with a focus

263
00:11:47,203 --> 00:11:51,307
on content and the other with a focus on monetization and mechanics.

264
00:11:52,388 --> 00:11:55,331
We're going to start by going through the formal rules and then we'll talk about sort

265
00:11:55,351 --> 00:11:56,912
of how that ends up working in practice.

266
00:11:58,273 --> 00:12:03,658
So formally on the monetization, you cannot have a randomized event, right?

267
00:12:03,818 --> 00:12:06,301
China defines a loot box as any randomized event.

268
00:12:07,192 --> 00:12:09,133
That seems a little overbroad, doesn't it?

269
00:12:09,173 --> 00:12:11,193
That seems like everything I put up on that first slide

270
00:12:11,213 --> 00:12:12,274
in the presentation today.

271
00:12:12,774 --> 00:12:14,234
But you can't have a randomized event

272
00:12:14,274 --> 00:12:16,455
for purchase with real money or virtual currency.

273
00:12:17,455 --> 00:12:18,775
This might be a translation issue.

274
00:12:18,915 --> 00:12:20,076
I think virtual currency actually

275
00:12:20,096 --> 00:12:21,316
means paid virtual currency.

276
00:12:22,076 --> 00:12:24,917
We haven't really seen any enforcement against games

277
00:12:24,957 --> 00:12:26,897
where you just have the gold you collect naturally

278
00:12:26,917 --> 00:12:27,657
through gameplay.

279
00:12:28,698 --> 00:12:30,738
But formally, it says any virtual currency.

280
00:12:30,798 --> 00:12:33,159
So as written and as translated into English,

281
00:12:33,539 --> 00:12:35,379
that could be even the currency you only

282
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,300
can earn through gameplay.

283
00:12:37,799 --> 00:12:40,541
Second rule is the virtual items or services that you offer

284
00:12:40,981 --> 00:12:42,362
have to be obtainable by other means.

285
00:12:43,703 --> 00:12:44,423
What are other means?

286
00:12:44,903 --> 00:12:46,384
That could mean that you could get it through gameplay,

287
00:12:46,404 --> 00:12:47,725
you could get it through randomized drops

288
00:12:47,765 --> 00:12:48,986
from killing monsters in the game.

289
00:12:49,426 --> 00:12:51,167
You could have it so that the only way to get the item

290
00:12:51,207 --> 00:12:52,788
is to purchase it outright from the store

291
00:12:53,108 --> 00:12:53,948
or get a loot box.

292
00:12:54,449 --> 00:12:57,230
So you can still have items that are only purchasable

293
00:12:57,370 --> 00:12:57,971
through real money,

294
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:00,452
but there has to be some other way to get that item.

295
00:13:02,662 --> 00:13:04,984
And then the third requirement is no compulsion loops.

296
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:07,487
These are like sort of Skinner box mechanics.

297
00:13:08,468 --> 00:13:11,131
We'll talk about in our hypothetical for this country

298
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:13,914
about what that might look like even in the context

299
00:13:13,954 --> 00:13:15,916
where you weren't directly selling the loot boxes.

300
00:13:18,278 --> 00:13:18,819
But that's not all.

301
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,862
China has regulations on disclosures

302
00:13:22,683 --> 00:13:24,945
and these are super onerous regulations.

303
00:13:26,090 --> 00:13:30,612
The first is you need to provide information about the odds for your loot box up front.

304
00:13:31,433 --> 00:13:33,914
And that information is not like Apple where it's by type.

305
00:13:34,695 --> 00:13:38,157
You're formally supposed to list your odds of getting every single item in that loot

306
00:13:38,197 --> 00:13:38,517
box.

307
00:13:39,177 --> 00:13:42,419
Now, that may just mean that you're taking the number of items that are in a category

308
00:13:42,479 --> 00:13:47,822
and dividing that category percentage to list them, but, you know, it is a more formal requirement.

309
00:13:49,043 --> 00:13:52,344
But not only do you have to list your odds in advance.

310
00:13:53,305 --> 00:13:55,067
Those odds have to be transparent to users.

311
00:13:55,728 --> 00:14:00,013
That means it's easy for a Chinese user to find those odds.

312
00:14:00,333 --> 00:14:03,217
Can't be complicated, can't be at the very bottom of your page,

313
00:14:03,257 --> 00:14:04,418
click here to see the odds.

314
00:14:04,979 --> 00:14:07,642
Basically, if they run a search for those odds,

315
00:14:07,702 --> 00:14:08,763
they should be able to find them.

316
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,420
And then the final requirement, which is incredibly labor

317
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:17,281
intensive, is that every game is supposed to keep for 90

318
00:14:17,682 --> 00:14:21,362
days and publicly make available the results of every

319
00:14:21,442 --> 00:14:23,223
single loot box outcome in their game.

320
00:14:24,343 --> 00:14:27,904
Thousands or millions of outcomes kept in a chart, and

321
00:14:27,924 --> 00:14:29,364
it's supposed to be publicly available.

322
00:14:30,105 --> 00:14:33,245
Now you might be thinking to yourself, well, I bet you 50

323
00:14:34,066 --> 00:14:37,466
bucks, you can't find a single company operating in China

324
00:14:37,486 --> 00:14:38,027
that does that.

325
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:40,351
And if you're thinking that, you'd be up $50.

326
00:14:42,672 --> 00:14:45,994
I searched through the top 20 licensed games in China,

327
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:47,655
and I wasn't able to find it.

328
00:14:48,075 --> 00:14:49,736
And so then I called my colleague in Hong Kong.

329
00:14:49,756 --> 00:14:51,296
I said, look, maybe it's a language barrier.

330
00:14:51,957 --> 00:14:54,078
And my colleague in Hong Kong couldn't find a single game

331
00:14:54,118 --> 00:14:54,778
that did that either.

332
00:14:56,119 --> 00:14:58,500
So I think what you see in China is a lot of rules,

333
00:14:59,261 --> 00:15:01,862
but really inconsistent enforcement of those rules.

334
00:15:03,463 --> 00:15:04,844
And the truth is, whether or not you

335
00:15:04,864 --> 00:15:06,485
can offer a loot box in China depends

336
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:07,705
on whether the government likes your game.

337
00:15:11,288 --> 00:15:13,569
So now we're going to come into today's last hypothetical.

338
00:15:14,610 --> 00:15:16,932
And this has to do with dynamic odds adjustment.

339
00:15:17,452 --> 00:15:20,454
So it's March, and Shady Corp's game is doing well,

340
00:15:20,494 --> 00:15:21,474
but they want it to do better.

341
00:15:21,494 --> 00:15:25,217
And so they're going to engage in dynamic odds adjustment.

342
00:15:25,437 --> 00:15:26,218
What do I mean by that?

343
00:15:26,238 --> 00:15:30,360
That means adjusting the odds of the outcomes for your loot box

344
00:15:31,381 --> 00:15:33,802
in the hopes of denying the player what they really want,

345
00:15:34,163 --> 00:15:35,784
so they keep buying more loot boxes.

346
00:15:36,583 --> 00:15:38,164
This can target a specific player.

347
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,365
We might have data and metrics that tell us

348
00:15:40,405 --> 00:15:41,326
about an individual player.

349
00:15:42,206 --> 00:15:45,347
But that sort of odds adjustment can be done on a wider basis.

350
00:15:46,108 --> 00:15:47,388
So in our example, it's March.

351
00:15:48,208 --> 00:15:49,709
St. Patrick's Day was Sunday.

352
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:52,770
And ShadyCorp realizes their players really

353
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:55,632
want to play with their St. Patrick's Day-themed chess set.

354
00:15:56,812 --> 00:15:59,473
And so previously, when you got one of their legendary chess

355
00:15:59,493 --> 00:16:01,714
sets, there was an even chance of getting a pirate chess set,

356
00:16:01,754 --> 00:16:03,995
a ninja chess set, a Halloween chess set.

357
00:16:05,585 --> 00:16:06,866
but they're gonna adjust the odds

358
00:16:06,926 --> 00:16:09,327
so the odds of getting that St. Patrick's Day chess set

359
00:16:09,367 --> 00:16:09,867
go down.

360
00:16:11,188 --> 00:16:12,368
And not only are they gonna do that,

361
00:16:12,709 --> 00:16:15,430
they realize no one wants a Halloween chess set in March.

362
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,211
So they're gonna increase the odds of that chess set.

363
00:16:18,611 --> 00:16:20,672
And the hope here is that the players

364
00:16:20,732 --> 00:16:21,633
don't get what they want,

365
00:16:22,173 --> 00:16:23,974
and so they keep purchasing more loot boxes.

366
00:16:25,975 --> 00:16:27,555
So let's talk globally.

367
00:16:28,336 --> 00:16:29,416
Is this practice legal?

368
00:16:29,696 --> 00:16:31,677
What does ShadyCorp have to do to make it legal?

369
00:16:33,118 --> 00:16:34,619
Well, in the United States.

370
00:16:35,430 --> 00:16:37,372
Yeah, currently you can do this.

371
00:16:38,714 --> 00:16:43,999
Even Apple's terms, right, only require disclosure of those top-level categories.

372
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:49,325
And here ShadyCorp isn't changing the odds of getting a legendary item, they're just

373
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:51,908
changing the odds a level below that, within the odds.

374
00:16:52,369 --> 00:16:55,593
So they don't even need to change their disclosures to comply with Apple's terms.

375
00:16:57,502 --> 00:17:01,424
It's conceivable that they might get an action for fraud

376
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:02,084
brought against them.

377
00:17:02,584 --> 00:17:03,925
But if they have a good lawyer, they're

378
00:17:03,985 --> 00:17:06,706
probably going to be OK right now in the United States.

379
00:17:07,927 --> 00:17:08,767
What about the EU?

380
00:17:09,387 --> 00:17:12,309
Similar answer, although I'd say EU courts are

381
00:17:12,349 --> 00:17:14,930
sort of more favorable to sort of creative legal actions.

382
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:16,911
So even though there's no strict law prohibiting it,

383
00:17:17,351 --> 00:17:19,031
probably slightly riskier in the EU.

384
00:17:19,612 --> 00:17:21,933
Obviously, you can't do this in Belgium.

385
00:17:22,833 --> 00:17:24,294
I think you could still do it in Holland,

386
00:17:24,354 --> 00:17:25,854
as long as you didn't restrict transfers.

387
00:17:26,730 --> 00:17:28,690
So what about China, the country we just talked about?

388
00:17:29,071 --> 00:17:32,152
Well, this violates the formal rules for a lot of reasons.

389
00:17:32,212 --> 00:17:33,692
First, it's a purchasable loot box.

390
00:17:34,672 --> 00:17:36,893
But even if there was geofencing for China,

391
00:17:37,053 --> 00:17:40,174
so that the game didn't have purchasable loot boxes there,

392
00:17:40,674 --> 00:17:42,035
this would still violate their rules,

393
00:17:42,535 --> 00:17:44,056
because this creates a compulsion loop.

394
00:17:44,616 --> 00:17:47,137
Even if the only way to get the loot box was from gameplay,

395
00:17:47,557 --> 00:17:49,898
this encourages the players to purchase the loot box,

396
00:17:49,958 --> 00:17:51,198
to get more and more, because they're never

397
00:17:51,238 --> 00:17:52,218
getting what they want out of it.

398
00:17:53,159 --> 00:17:55,159
So that's sort of where the compulsion loop rule

399
00:17:55,219 --> 00:17:55,960
comes in in China.

400
00:17:57,450 --> 00:17:59,191
But of course, as we've seen in China,

401
00:17:59,231 --> 00:18:01,133
particularly with the disclosure requirements,

402
00:18:01,734 --> 00:18:03,035
often those rules aren't enforced.

403
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:04,797
So maybe the answer here would be

404
00:18:04,817 --> 00:18:07,179
to work with a partner in China who has influence,

405
00:18:07,700 --> 00:18:09,722
although that's less successful than it used to be.

406
00:18:12,164 --> 00:18:14,206
So our takeaways for Chinese regulation

407
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:16,849
is no loot box is purchasable with real money

408
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:17,790
or virtual currency.

409
00:18:19,156 --> 00:18:23,058
There's flexible and unclear rules that give the government a lot of enforcement power.

410
00:18:23,518 --> 00:18:27,521
And there's a particular focus from the regulatory entities on preventing these compulsion loops.

411
00:18:29,102 --> 00:18:32,904
There's disclosure requirements that exist in China and in Apple's requirements, but

412
00:18:32,924 --> 00:18:36,766
in practice, these requirements can be designed around or simply ignored.

413
00:18:37,926 --> 00:18:41,468
And then that final point is I'd recommend working with a partner who's established in

414
00:18:41,528 --> 00:18:43,690
China if you're doing these practices there.

415
00:18:46,528 --> 00:18:48,229
So to wrap up my presentation today,

416
00:18:48,329 --> 00:18:49,610
how are loot boxes regulated?

417
00:18:49,790 --> 00:18:51,171
Well, it depends on the regulator.

418
00:18:51,631 --> 00:18:53,972
But there's no major regulation in Western countries

419
00:18:54,132 --> 00:18:55,413
outside of Holland and Belgium.

420
00:18:56,013 --> 00:18:57,854
And there's inconsistent enforcement in China.

421
00:18:59,035 --> 00:19:00,135
And that answer is right.

422
00:19:01,356 --> 00:19:02,756
But there's also a second right answer,

423
00:19:02,997 --> 00:19:04,757
which is how loot boxes are regulated

424
00:19:05,278 --> 00:19:07,979
depends on what everyone in this room does going forward.

425
00:19:09,060 --> 00:19:10,180
Just because as of March 2019,

426
00:19:10,220 --> 00:19:12,161
there's no loot box regulation

427
00:19:12,221 --> 00:19:13,462
doesn't mean there won't be tomorrow.

428
00:19:13,902 --> 00:19:15,363
And whether you realize it or not,

429
00:19:15,543 --> 00:19:16,943
as a developer or a publisher,

430
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:19,144
you're a part of a collective dialogue

431
00:19:19,785 --> 00:19:21,325
about how we interact with our players,

432
00:19:21,685 --> 00:19:24,707
our customers, and about how we wanna be regulated.

433
00:19:25,727 --> 00:19:27,108
And so I urge you going forward

434
00:19:27,248 --> 00:19:28,969
to be careful how you use loot boxes

435
00:19:29,309 --> 00:19:31,910
and to take simple steps to prevent problems.

436
00:19:32,670 --> 00:19:34,591
Have parental controls that can be enabled

437
00:19:34,671 --> 00:19:36,612
so that young children don't purchase loot boxes.

438
00:19:37,488 --> 00:19:41,992
You can reach out to players who you think might be exhibiting problematic behavior and

439
00:19:42,012 --> 00:19:44,515
who you also think may not have the money to be doing so.

440
00:19:45,295 --> 00:19:49,739
The simplest and most important thing you can do is when your colleagues or your friends

441
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:54,844
or your parents talk to you about loot boxes, don't paint it as a black and white issue.

442
00:19:55,205 --> 00:19:59,609
Don't just say loot boxes are okay or they're bad because the truth is it's not loot boxes

443
00:19:59,629 --> 00:20:00,309
that are a problem.

444
00:20:01,248 --> 00:20:02,849
which the problem is when loot boxes are used

445
00:20:02,889 --> 00:20:04,970
to do other things, when they're used to create

446
00:20:04,990 --> 00:20:07,151
those compulsion loops to keep players playing longer

447
00:20:07,171 --> 00:20:09,432
than they want to, when they're used to create

448
00:20:09,472 --> 00:20:11,713
pay-to-win mechanics, so players can't win

449
00:20:11,733 --> 00:20:13,314
from their skill or time no matter how long

450
00:20:13,354 --> 00:20:14,015
they play the game.

451
00:20:15,075 --> 00:20:16,816
Loot boxes are a problem when they're not transparent,

452
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:18,657
when players don't know what's going on.

453
00:20:19,278 --> 00:20:21,819
And when we frame the discussion as solving

454
00:20:21,859 --> 00:20:23,460
these other problems, I think we realize

455
00:20:23,480 --> 00:20:25,121
that there's all sorts of game mechanics

456
00:20:25,441 --> 00:20:26,641
that can run into these issues.

457
00:20:27,302 --> 00:20:29,123
And the key is how we use the mechanics,

458
00:20:29,263 --> 00:20:30,143
not whether we use them.

459
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,563
To be clear, I'm not worried about a world

460
00:20:34,643 --> 00:20:35,604
where this is regulated.

461
00:20:36,685 --> 00:20:38,207
I don't want this regulated, but I'm

462
00:20:38,247 --> 00:20:39,428
OK with it being regulated.

463
00:20:40,089 --> 00:20:41,451
But I'm concerned that the people who

464
00:20:41,491 --> 00:20:43,513
are going to pass the regulations aren't gamers.

465
00:20:44,014 --> 00:20:46,196
They're not lawyers like me who spend their days working

466
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:46,857
on these issues.

467
00:20:47,218 --> 00:20:49,180
And that instead of getting this regulated,

468
00:20:49,340 --> 00:20:50,962
what we're going to get is all of this regulated.

469
00:20:51,879 --> 00:20:53,701
And by having those thoughtful discussions,

470
00:20:54,121 --> 00:20:55,463
by shaping the dialogue in a way

471
00:20:55,483 --> 00:20:56,964
that highlights the real issues,

472
00:20:57,545 --> 00:21:00,208
while acknowledging that oftentimes loot boxes are fine,

473
00:21:00,228 --> 00:21:02,190
we can prevent entering this world

474
00:21:02,210 --> 00:21:03,251
where all this is regulated.

475
00:21:05,913 --> 00:21:06,614
Thank you so much.

476
00:21:07,175 --> 00:21:08,576
I really appreciate you taking the time

477
00:21:08,596 --> 00:21:09,517
to come to today's talk.

478
00:21:09,637 --> 00:21:11,439
I've put my contact info up on the board.

479
00:21:12,732 --> 00:21:14,152
I don't know if we have time for questions,

480
00:21:14,192 --> 00:21:16,654
but if we don't, I will be in the wrap up room.

481
00:21:16,674 --> 00:21:18,394
There's tables down the hall right outside of 305.

482
00:21:18,915 --> 00:21:21,416
I'm happy to stick around and talk about these issues

483
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:22,696
for as long as you guys would like.

484
00:21:23,657 --> 00:21:24,697
The other reminder I'll give you

485
00:21:24,777 --> 00:21:26,518
is to please fill out your feedback surveys.

486
00:21:27,318 --> 00:21:29,680
Last year after I presented, I'll say I was really impressed

487
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,120
with the detailed feedback you gave

488
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:33,441
and the positive feedback about what I could do better,

489
00:21:33,501 --> 00:21:34,322
what I could do more of.

490
00:21:34,802 --> 00:21:36,363
Hopefully I've incorporated that this year

491
00:21:36,683 --> 00:21:38,163
and I'll try and incorporate it next year too.

492
00:21:38,544 --> 00:21:39,504
So thank you so much, guys.

493
00:22:04,914 --> 00:22:06,758
Oh, I don't know if we're, no questions?

494
00:22:07,019 --> 00:22:07,159
Yeah.

495
00:22:07,460 --> 00:22:09,184
Yeah, we have five minutes left.

496
00:22:09,224 --> 00:22:09,504
Oh, okay.

497
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,268
So, more than welcome.

498
00:22:11,288 --> 00:22:13,533
So I'll stay up here and ask questions until the...

499
00:22:15,907 --> 00:22:19,651
Yeah, no, I just had a quick question of, I was just wondering how, you know, do you

500
00:22:19,691 --> 00:22:23,415
see this as evolving? I mean, there's all the, you know, there's definitely everyone's

501
00:22:23,435 --> 00:22:26,238
sort of, especially Europe, has, you know, had a lot of sort of privacy rights and a

502
00:22:26,278 --> 00:22:31,163
lot of, you know, movement on other fronts as far as, you know, rights of the consumer.

503
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:35,547
Do you see this as like, oh, we've kind of settled down or, oh my gosh, it's changing

504
00:22:35,587 --> 00:22:35,888
every year?

505
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:38,604
I think it will change.

506
00:22:38,624 --> 00:22:40,065
I don't think it's going to change in the next year.

507
00:22:40,726 --> 00:22:41,367
Now, who knows?

508
00:22:41,427 --> 00:22:43,789
Maybe next year there'll be presentation loot boxes,

509
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:44,990
everything I said last year was wrong,

510
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:46,011
and there'll be a bunch of changes.

511
00:22:46,111 --> 00:22:49,614
But no, I don't think short-term change is likely.

512
00:22:50,135 --> 00:22:52,417
But I do think we're going to see very slow movement

513
00:22:52,477 --> 00:22:53,618
to recognize these issues.

514
00:22:54,379 --> 00:22:57,060
At least in the US, the FTC is holding a workshop.

515
00:22:57,100 --> 00:22:59,480
They've yet to set a date, but sometime in the next six

516
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:01,041
months, they'll have a discussion.

517
00:23:01,361 --> 00:23:03,502
And I'm hopeful that's going to be really valuable,

518
00:23:04,042 --> 00:23:05,743
because they'll have the opportunity

519
00:23:05,763 --> 00:23:07,904
to hear not just from parents and players who

520
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:10,645
are having issues on their side, but also from the developers

521
00:23:10,665 --> 00:23:11,385
about what they're doing.

522
00:23:11,905 --> 00:23:14,926
And I'm hoping what we get to is a place where they identify

523
00:23:14,966 --> 00:23:17,447
a couple really bad practices and prohibit just

524
00:23:17,487 --> 00:23:19,708
those really bad practices, and otherwise let

525
00:23:19,748 --> 00:23:20,928
us do what we want in our games.

526
00:23:21,709 --> 00:23:22,689
So that's where I see it going.

527
00:23:22,709 --> 00:23:23,669
That's where I hope it's going.

528
00:23:23,689 --> 00:23:26,510
And I don't think we're going to see any legislative change

529
00:23:26,530 --> 00:23:27,271
in the next 12 months.

530
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:28,291
Thank you.

531
00:23:29,831 --> 00:23:30,031
Yes.

532
00:23:31,272 --> 00:23:31,892
Thank you, by the way.

533
00:23:32,292 --> 00:23:33,033
Great presentation.

534
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:35,173
I was wondering if you could provide some more detail

535
00:23:35,413 --> 00:23:39,815
on defining or proving or disproving a compulsion loop.

536
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:42,076
It sounds like it's rather subjective, something

537
00:23:42,096 --> 00:23:44,617
that might be compulsive for me, might not

538
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,237
be compulsive for someone else.

539
00:23:46,297 --> 00:23:48,058
So how do you kind of navigate that?

540
00:23:48,834 --> 00:23:50,656
Sure, look, I think that's a fabulous question.

541
00:23:51,137 --> 00:23:52,859
I think that highlights a reason I

542
00:23:53,139 --> 00:23:55,362
don't want to see a Chinese-style regulation

543
00:23:55,402 --> 00:23:58,186
in the West, because it's really hard to define those things.

544
00:23:59,328 --> 00:24:02,412
I will say sort of the counter to that is,

545
00:24:02,472 --> 00:24:05,095
you know, going back to my slide in here, I'll...

546
00:24:06,117 --> 00:24:07,718
You know, going back to this slide,

547
00:24:08,338 --> 00:24:10,540
it's clear the desire here is to get the player

548
00:24:10,580 --> 00:24:12,241
to spend more than they would spend

549
00:24:12,281 --> 00:24:13,602
before you adjusted the odds.

550
00:24:14,123 --> 00:24:15,684
And so although it is hard to define,

551
00:24:15,764 --> 00:24:17,585
there are cases where it's pretty clear

552
00:24:17,605 --> 00:24:18,546
that's what you're doing.

553
00:24:18,566 --> 00:24:22,749
And I'm not exactly sure how I would design a regulation

554
00:24:22,829 --> 00:24:26,032
to prohibit this sort of stuff without being over-inclusive.

555
00:24:26,572 --> 00:24:29,114
And like I just said, I'm hoping that the FTC is

556
00:24:29,154 --> 00:24:30,975
thoughtful about that, that we have a discussion.

557
00:24:31,236 --> 00:24:33,597
And what we result with is very targeted rules.

558
00:24:34,498 --> 00:24:36,120
that sort of prohibits specific practices.

559
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:38,242
But I agree, it's hard to define, and I think one

560
00:24:38,262 --> 00:24:40,364
of the challenges you face operating in China

561
00:24:40,484 --> 00:24:41,545
and with that sort of regulation.

562
00:24:42,446 --> 00:24:43,727
Okay. Thanks.

563
00:24:44,953 --> 00:24:45,134
Yes.

564
00:24:46,154 --> 00:24:48,394
I was curious about that definition of transferability

565
00:24:48,754 --> 00:24:50,575
that Holland is using right now, if that's

566
00:24:50,895 --> 00:24:53,176
exclusive to just primary marketplaces,

567
00:24:53,396 --> 00:24:55,836
or if there is like, in my mind, there

568
00:24:55,896 --> 00:24:57,857
is the same ethical quandary if you're

569
00:24:57,897 --> 00:25:00,577
aware of an active secondary marketplace out there,

570
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,918
and you still implement that design choice.

571
00:25:02,938 --> 00:25:05,159
I'm curious how they're kind of drawing the line now.

572
00:25:05,579 --> 00:25:07,479
Sure, so transferability, I think,

573
00:25:07,519 --> 00:25:08,900
is distinguishable from marketplace.

574
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:12,180
So the line is, do you enable users

575
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:13,401
to transfer between accounts?

576
00:25:14,596 --> 00:25:17,919
We recognize that users could sell their whole account,

577
00:25:17,979 --> 00:25:19,320
but as long as your game prohibits

578
00:25:19,500 --> 00:25:21,562
any transfer of the items between accounts,

579
00:25:22,162 --> 00:25:23,223
other than selling the whole account,

580
00:25:23,263 --> 00:25:24,684
there's not much the player can do.

581
00:25:25,525 --> 00:25:27,306
And I don't think it's your job to regulate

582
00:25:27,346 --> 00:25:28,507
that third-party marketplace.

583
00:25:29,127 --> 00:25:30,408
But you don't get to go away and say,

584
00:25:30,468 --> 00:25:33,391
oh, we have our terms of service that says, oh, you can't sell

585
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:34,331
it, but you can transfer it.

586
00:25:34,572 --> 00:25:35,192
That doesn't work.

587
00:25:35,332 --> 00:25:37,354
If it's transferable at all between accounts,

588
00:25:37,974 --> 00:25:38,555
that's a problem.

589
00:25:38,575 --> 00:25:40,896
So that's pretty much the line we see in Holland right now.

590
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:47,638
Hey, you mentioned talking a lot about fuzzy language

591
00:25:47,738 --> 00:25:49,180
with a lot of the China laws.

592
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,002
We found that we've struggled a lot with that

593
00:25:51,142 --> 00:25:52,544
in Taiwan and Japan too.

594
00:25:52,564 --> 00:25:54,106
There's a lot of fuzzy language

595
00:25:54,146 --> 00:25:55,547
that our publisher is pushing for.

596
00:25:55,567 --> 00:25:57,509
Do you have any tips on how to navigate

597
00:25:57,549 --> 00:25:59,772
when you are encountering foreign language barriers

598
00:25:59,812 --> 00:26:01,994
and there is fuzzy language in the regulations?

599
00:26:03,010 --> 00:26:06,553
Sure, so one strategy is to work with a partner who understands them.

600
00:26:06,753 --> 00:26:11,078
And when that isn't working, to be honest, the best strategy is to formally not be in

601
00:26:11,118 --> 00:26:11,858
that marketplace.

602
00:26:12,259 --> 00:26:17,524
So, most games downloaded in China right now, for example, are not officially licensed games.

603
00:26:18,244 --> 00:26:20,386
And those publishers don't officially market in China.

604
00:26:20,426 --> 00:26:23,188
They just put them up on Steam, and the users use VPNs,

605
00:26:23,228 --> 00:26:24,509
and they get around the government restrictions,

606
00:26:24,529 --> 00:26:25,250
and they download them.

607
00:26:25,810 --> 00:26:28,392
And so there's sort of this all-in or all-out approach.

608
00:26:28,733 --> 00:26:30,114
Like either you're working with a partner,

609
00:26:30,134 --> 00:26:32,115
you're hiring lawyers, you're actively interfacing

610
00:26:32,135 --> 00:26:33,577
with the government to figure out what works.

611
00:26:34,037 --> 00:26:35,558
And for large companies, that works well.

612
00:26:36,179 --> 00:26:37,700
For small companies, for companies

613
00:26:37,720 --> 00:26:38,721
that are sort of still emerging,

614
00:26:39,081 --> 00:26:40,302
honestly, I think the best practice

615
00:26:40,362 --> 00:26:41,823
is to not formally be in that market.

616
00:26:42,404 --> 00:26:44,606
but then still hope that your player base

617
00:26:44,806 --> 00:26:45,868
builds an active community.

618
00:26:46,168 --> 00:26:47,850
And that's very luck driven, and it's frustrating.

619
00:26:47,890 --> 00:26:49,812
But honestly, I think that's the best solution

620
00:26:50,453 --> 00:26:52,636
if you don't have the funds to really engage.

621
00:26:52,656 --> 00:26:53,437
Thanks.

622
00:26:54,998 --> 00:26:55,659
So it seems that.

623
00:26:56,558 --> 00:26:58,639
Kind of the major problem with the hypothetical

624
00:26:58,679 --> 00:27:00,960
is a non-flat rarity within the types.

625
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:03,421
I was wondering if you think it is arguable

626
00:27:03,541 --> 00:27:07,162
that wildcard systems, kind of like Magic Arena's system

627
00:27:07,202 --> 00:27:08,763
where you're accumulating a wildcard

628
00:27:08,783 --> 00:27:10,063
that then gives the player a choice,

629
00:27:11,644 --> 00:27:15,785
allows you to get away with non-flat rarity schemes

630
00:27:16,405 --> 00:27:18,546
easier than without such systems.

631
00:27:19,798 --> 00:27:22,440
Sure, I mean, that's an interesting question, right?

632
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:23,961
When you say get away with, let's start with,

633
00:27:24,001 --> 00:27:25,102
these are Apple's requirements.

634
00:27:26,143 --> 00:27:28,765
And my understanding is the magic platforms

635
00:27:28,785 --> 00:27:30,846
that currently exist are not yet on iOS.

636
00:27:31,526 --> 00:27:32,867
Maybe they're moving in that direction.

637
00:27:32,887 --> 00:27:35,069
But at least as of when I was last playing,

638
00:27:35,129 --> 00:27:36,390
it was PC only.

639
00:27:37,370 --> 00:27:39,051
So there's no formal requirements

640
00:27:39,071 --> 00:27:40,492
they have to comply with for Apple.

641
00:27:41,873 --> 00:27:43,333
I'm not sure it makes it easier to get around,

642
00:27:43,353 --> 00:27:45,454
although you'll notice here I put magic cards up here.

643
00:27:45,814 --> 00:27:47,294
And I think what's really interesting

644
00:27:47,554 --> 00:27:49,255
about how Wizards of the Coast is doing magic,

645
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:50,635
there's actually three different models.

646
00:27:50,795 --> 00:27:52,555
You have physical cards that are transferable.

647
00:27:53,175 --> 00:27:54,956
You have digital cards that are transferable

648
00:27:54,996 --> 00:27:55,956
on their old platform.

649
00:27:56,396 --> 00:27:58,297
And now their newest platform has digital cards

650
00:27:58,317 --> 00:27:59,317
that aren't transferable.

651
00:27:59,717 --> 00:28:02,177
So we sort of see them moving towards a regime

652
00:28:02,197 --> 00:28:03,218
where they're not transferring.

653
00:28:04,718 --> 00:28:05,918
And certainly in Holland, right,

654
00:28:06,038 --> 00:28:07,579
I guess that sort of gets around the issue

655
00:28:07,639 --> 00:28:09,039
because you don't have transferability.

656
00:28:10,259 --> 00:28:12,680
This is probably a long way of saying I don't have an answer for your question.

657
00:28:12,721 --> 00:28:14,842
I haven't really thought about how wildcards affect that.

658
00:28:16,022 --> 00:28:20,144
I'm sort of skeptical that you could just include wildcards and get around it, but right

659
00:28:20,184 --> 00:28:21,425
now it's sort of the wild west anyway.

660
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,878
Hey, thanks for the presentation.

661
00:28:26,299 --> 00:28:29,321
Is there a noted line, bright or otherwise,

662
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,623
or substantive difference with loot boxes

663
00:28:31,663 --> 00:28:33,524
that are for purchase versus granted

664
00:28:33,584 --> 00:28:35,526
as some sort of progression that you've seen,

665
00:28:35,666 --> 00:28:38,488
meaning more lax restrictions on things

666
00:28:38,708 --> 00:28:40,910
that are used to be rewards that you can't actually purchase?

667
00:28:41,130 --> 00:28:42,431
Is there a delineation anywhere?

668
00:28:42,860 --> 00:28:43,541
Sure, absolutely.

669
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:46,804
Certainly in Holland, I mean, throughout all of Europe,

670
00:28:46,824 --> 00:28:47,805
there's a delineation.

671
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,968
You can have progression-based loot boxes

672
00:28:51,289 --> 00:28:53,210
in both Holland and Belgium, so long as they're not

673
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:54,932
paying real money for it.

674
00:28:54,972 --> 00:28:57,655
In the West, what we see, almost all the entities attaching

675
00:28:57,715 --> 00:28:59,016
some requirement to is real money.

676
00:28:59,797 --> 00:29:01,739
Even the ESRB, which sort of lumps them

677
00:29:01,779 --> 00:29:03,801
all in with their general purchases,

678
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:05,642
the key is that you're paying money for it.

679
00:29:06,323 --> 00:29:09,024
In China, no, there's not a distinction there.

680
00:29:09,064 --> 00:29:11,204
And in fact, those additional rules about compulsion loops

681
00:29:11,344 --> 00:29:13,125
mainly apply to those sort of mechanics

682
00:29:13,765 --> 00:29:15,545
because you can't purchase them to begin with.

683
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:18,346
So the only time that compulsion loop rules

684
00:29:18,366 --> 00:29:19,966
are going to come into play is when you're offering

685
00:29:19,986 --> 00:29:21,327
those boxes through gameplay.

686
00:29:22,147 --> 00:29:22,327
Thanks.

687
00:29:24,508 --> 00:29:25,228
Awesome, well, perfect.

688
00:29:25,248 --> 00:29:26,768
We are right at the end time now.

689
00:29:26,888 --> 00:29:27,908
So thank you so much.

690
00:29:28,009 --> 00:29:28,969
I appreciate all your questions.

691
00:29:29,009 --> 00:29:30,029
I appreciate you all coming.

692
00:29:30,469 --> 00:29:32,530
And again, I'm going to go down to the tables outside 305

693
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,650
if you want to chat some more.
