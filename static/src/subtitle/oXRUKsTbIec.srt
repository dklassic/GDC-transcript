1
00:00:06,262 --> 00:00:09,184
Before I begin, I'm Liz, I'm an animator.

2
00:00:09,264 --> 00:00:12,966
I've been animating for close to 15 years now.

3
00:00:14,467 --> 00:00:20,191
And I recently was able to work on a VR project

4
00:00:21,132 --> 00:00:22,552
and I learned a lot.

5
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:27,256
So I want to share tips, tricks for

6
00:00:28,256 --> 00:00:32,319
how to think about VR when you're on your animation project.

7
00:00:33,653 --> 00:00:40,316
Before I get into the VR part, I want to point out how animation principles don't change across mediums.

8
00:00:41,316 --> 00:00:48,000
There are, of course, tips and tricks to work within each type and style of animation, but I'm not going to get into the weeds on those.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,241
But no, for VR, these again are tips and tricks.

10
00:00:53,162 --> 00:00:56,904
How immersive VR is, and what draws people to it?

11
00:00:57,904 --> 00:00:58,705
With any medium.

12
00:00:59,812 --> 00:01:01,393
What is the story you want to tell?

13
00:01:01,413 --> 00:01:04,814
And what you were trying to say are two questions

14
00:01:05,994 --> 00:01:07,875
we should always keep in mind.

15
00:01:08,835 --> 00:01:11,876
With VR, because it is a limited audience,

16
00:01:12,636 --> 00:01:15,377
we should always be asking, why VR?

17
00:01:16,297 --> 00:01:18,538
For a number of experiences, VR is

18
00:01:18,698 --> 00:01:21,198
used to put the audience in someone else's shoes.

19
00:01:21,678 --> 00:01:26,780
Traveling while black, Carni Arena, are great examples.

20
00:01:28,666 --> 00:01:31,247
They use this in their storytelling.

21
00:01:31,267 --> 00:01:39,092
This documentary style pushes the audience to feel and experience something they may

22
00:01:39,132 --> 00:01:43,174
not have had an opportunity to feel and experience.

23
00:01:45,255 --> 00:01:48,277
We are being put in the shoes of someone we should empathize with.

24
00:01:48,997 --> 00:01:50,598
It's a great storytelling tool.

25
00:01:51,443 --> 00:01:57,266
Traditional theater has been around for a good amount of time, and there are some impressive

26
00:01:57,326 --> 00:02:00,087
things we've done to set the stage.

27
00:02:00,908 --> 00:02:06,810
We've learned over the years how to direct the audience, to look and take notice of one

28
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:11,892
part of the stage while the other part might be in the process of being set up.

29
00:02:12,553 --> 00:02:19,196
Sometimes it's a lighting change, or the curtain is drawn, or a backdrop lifts to reveal a

30
00:02:19,996 --> 00:02:21,056
much larger stage.

31
00:02:22,537 --> 00:02:24,999
Sometimes the actors walk in with their set pieces.

32
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:31,183
There are lots of tricks used to help bring attention to where attention should be.

33
00:02:32,303 --> 00:02:38,947
In immersive theater, stage techniques are used, but the audience is now on the stage as well.

34
00:02:39,948 --> 00:02:45,772
How the actors move around and take into account where people might be is an impressive show.

35
00:02:46,512 --> 00:02:48,713
Part theater, part improv.

36
00:02:50,684 --> 00:02:55,807
And these actors know just how to move to convey that they need where they need to go.

37
00:02:57,367 --> 00:03:02,830
Right where you are. If you get a chance to see an immersive theater piece, I highly recommend

38
00:03:02,890 --> 00:03:09,473
going. It's kind of hard to do right now because of COVID, but if you ever get a chance, go.

39
00:03:10,533 --> 00:03:15,916
Sleep No More in New York is probably the most well-known. It is not the only one.

40
00:03:19,804 --> 00:03:24,185
definitely an experience that is hard to describe.

41
00:03:24,205 --> 00:03:29,387
On Wolves, we worked with an immersive theater company,

42
00:03:30,387 --> 00:03:35,829
Third Rail Projects, based out of Brooklyn.

43
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:44,112
So if you ever get a chance, please Google all of these.

44
00:03:48,707 --> 00:03:51,408
How do you storyboard or plan for VR?

45
00:03:52,588 --> 00:03:53,828
Since there is no camera,

46
00:03:53,868 --> 00:03:57,170
storyboarding might seem like a huge pain point.

47
00:03:58,210 --> 00:04:01,031
How are you supposed to possibly show

48
00:04:01,051 --> 00:04:03,832
what is going on when there is no camera?

49
00:04:03,852 --> 00:04:05,833
How do you show composition?

50
00:04:05,853 --> 00:04:09,454
What do storyboards look like when dealing with VR?

51
00:04:11,499 --> 00:04:15,461
It's a question that has no single answer,

52
00:04:16,081 --> 00:04:21,885
and I've seen many ways that people plan, storyboard, previs.

53
00:04:22,225 --> 00:04:24,467
It's all of the things.

54
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:29,070
It's not a simple answer.

55
00:04:29,090 --> 00:04:32,652
For VR, there is no correct way to board.

56
00:04:33,332 --> 00:04:36,334
For some VR experiences, the action and characters

57
00:04:36,394 --> 00:04:39,436
are in one general direction at any specific time.

58
00:04:40,685 --> 00:04:48,270
forward, if you would. You could board these types of VR experiences more traditionally.

59
00:04:48,971 --> 00:04:53,474
They're obviously in front of you. The camera may change slightly depending on how someone

60
00:04:53,514 --> 00:05:00,739
is standing, if they're sitting, or if they're standing up. If they decide to lie down on the

61
00:05:00,779 --> 00:05:07,044
ground, it will change how the camera looks, but the general composition can stay

62
00:05:09,724 --> 00:05:11,224
not the same, but similar.

63
00:05:13,366 --> 00:05:17,368
For others, the characters and action is happening all around.

64
00:05:17,388 --> 00:05:21,911
These types are more difficult to board, but not impossible.

65
00:05:23,071 --> 00:05:25,313
When thinking about the pre-production phase,

66
00:05:25,733 --> 00:05:28,194
for characters, development is key.

67
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,576
With or without boards, understanding your character

68
00:05:32,597 --> 00:05:36,059
or characters is going to be extremely important,

69
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:38,901
since you won't have traditional boards to reference.

70
00:05:39,559 --> 00:05:47,222
On Wolves, though we did not have storyboards, we did have character sheets and we spent a good

71
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:55,765
amount of time developing our characters. That meant creating many facial poses as we could

72
00:05:55,785 --> 00:06:02,288
to reference throughout Wolves. Our facial library was a great starting point for animators to

73
00:06:02,368 --> 00:06:09,110
utilize and because we didn't have locked cameras, even though we had that library,

74
00:06:10,171 --> 00:06:12,592
we used it as a foundation to build up from.

75
00:06:13,693 --> 00:06:17,755
Just because a pose looks and works well at eye level

76
00:06:18,336 --> 00:06:20,777
does not mean it's going to work well

77
00:06:20,937 --> 00:06:23,519
once our character is sitting on the floor looking up at us.

78
00:06:26,921 --> 00:06:29,782
As for broad body movement, poses matter,

79
00:06:30,583 --> 00:06:33,885
but a pose up close will look different and feel different

80
00:06:34,965 --> 00:06:36,766
than a pose 15 feet away.

81
00:06:37,613 --> 00:06:43,315
For Wolves, we relied on third rail projects to help us choreograph those movements.

82
00:06:43,856 --> 00:06:45,056
And it is choreographed.

83
00:06:46,017 --> 00:06:51,439
There were several rehearsals and back and forth with the director on what was working

84
00:06:51,499 --> 00:06:53,640
and how they wanted the audience to feel.

85
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:58,962
The actors took our base, our foundation, and expanded on what we could do.

86
00:06:58,982 --> 00:07:03,524
And the rehearsals were filmed and then edited as reference.

87
00:07:04,205 --> 00:07:04,625
We have...

88
00:07:07,430 --> 00:07:12,254
some people would call it a boardomatic, but because it was live filmed reference,

89
00:07:13,055 --> 00:07:19,720
we have the actors coming and entering in different directions. And our camera was

90
00:07:20,881 --> 00:07:28,948
the audience, the player at center, and would move based off of where we wanted

91
00:07:28,968 --> 00:07:34,392
our attention to be drawn. So it was

92
00:07:35,949 --> 00:07:40,671
extremely useful, extremely important that we had this.

93
00:07:41,752 --> 00:07:46,314
And it also helped us understand where our pain points were going to be.

94
00:07:50,276 --> 00:07:51,957
Whenever you get a chance, act it out, right?

95
00:07:53,478 --> 00:07:58,000
Preference is super important. Any animator can tell you that.

96
00:07:58,580 --> 00:08:01,842
How do we map out where our character is and where they are going?

97
00:08:01,862 --> 00:08:05,184
We used top-down.

98
00:08:06,054 --> 00:08:09,977
view to map out where our character was and where they were going.

99
00:08:11,117 --> 00:08:15,261
You can imagine a blueprint of that one, two, three bedroom apartment.

100
00:08:15,281 --> 00:08:16,361
That's what we did.

101
00:08:16,762 --> 00:08:19,824
We laid out where everything would be placed

102
00:08:20,184 --> 00:08:24,307
and where our characters would be at the start and at the end of each scene.

103
00:08:25,068 --> 00:08:28,350
So we could have the scenery transition around her

104
00:08:28,471 --> 00:08:32,153
instead of her leaving and walking into a brand new scene.

105
00:08:32,997 --> 00:08:38,921
On Wolves, we focused on Lucy, where she was, and we designed the set around her movements.

106
00:08:39,181 --> 00:08:46,246
That doesn't mean we didn't start building sets beforehand. We definitely made sure that

107
00:08:47,827 --> 00:08:54,211
we had an idea of what our sets were going to look like. So it was a general look,

108
00:08:54,832 --> 00:09:00,916
and we would have maybe a table or a chair, a couch, and

109
00:09:01,597 --> 00:09:11,202
based off of the actor and what they were doing, we maybe shifted things so that Lucy's actions,

110
00:09:12,023 --> 00:09:19,247
the actor, could really just do what they're best at and act and not have to worry too much about

111
00:09:19,667 --> 00:09:21,649
where something was placed in 3D.

112
00:09:24,642 --> 00:09:30,724
That said, on a mocap stage, when you do have actors interacting with a couch, a table,

113
00:09:31,264 --> 00:09:33,125
you want there to be a couch and table.

114
00:09:33,886 --> 00:09:39,348
But we were also very flexible with where things were placed.

115
00:09:39,368 --> 00:09:50,213
So plan, but also understand that you have to be flexible in order to get the best performance

116
00:09:50,253 --> 00:09:50,673
you can.

117
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,342
and really to make your project as seamless as possible.

118
00:09:59,822 --> 00:10:04,365
Our blueprint was a foundation, but it was also flexible.

119
00:10:04,545 --> 00:10:07,346
So my advice is to plan as much as you can,

120
00:10:07,547 --> 00:10:10,228
but be prepared to change everything.

121
00:10:10,248 --> 00:10:13,410
We also had to film ourselves

122
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:16,071
to figure out some design issues we were having.

123
00:10:16,091 --> 00:10:19,293
There is one scene where there are four humans

124
00:10:19,373 --> 00:10:20,994
and four wolves all running around.

125
00:10:22,374 --> 00:10:27,235
We knew how everything was supposed to start and where everyone was supposed to end up.

126
00:10:28,296 --> 00:10:33,177
The middle was a big question, so we went out into the parking lot, drew the player circle,

127
00:10:34,017 --> 00:10:39,239
which is just a circle on the ground with someone standing in the center,

128
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:45,160
so that we knew how close we were to the player, to the audience.

129
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:55,421
And we set up a camera on someone. We set up someone's phone up high to look at us

130
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:01,025
running around and see a bunch of people running around.

131
00:11:01,045 --> 00:11:09,072
And outside of my think this looks like utter chaos, it wasn't. We all knew which role we had,

132
00:11:10,012 --> 00:11:14,696
even though the characters were running, we walked it out first.

133
00:11:18,754 --> 00:11:21,095
we based our movements off of each other.

134
00:11:21,876 --> 00:11:24,777
If we saw someone was gonna be in the way

135
00:11:24,837 --> 00:11:27,079
of someone's path, we adjusted.

136
00:11:27,099 --> 00:11:32,102
And we rehearsed that a few times.

137
00:11:33,223 --> 00:11:39,027
And we then took those paths

138
00:11:39,947 --> 00:11:44,010
throughout actual blueprint of where those paths would be

139
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:47,512
and set that up on a mocap stage for the actors.

140
00:11:48,467 --> 00:11:50,588
And even then we adjusted.

141
00:11:51,168 --> 00:11:56,490
So we planned, just plan, adjust.

142
00:11:56,510 --> 00:12:05,833
And of course, even though, again, we planned,

143
00:12:06,893 --> 00:12:08,914
we still had to make last minute adjustments

144
00:12:08,954 --> 00:12:09,914
for the mocap stage.

145
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:13,315
Not all scenes were this complicated.

146
00:12:13,975 --> 00:12:17,216
Most were pretty straightforward, one character.

147
00:12:17,985 --> 00:12:19,905
Where do they enter the scene or room?

148
00:12:20,125 --> 00:12:22,666
And how does the room appear around them?

149
00:12:23,706 --> 00:12:27,847
Where are they in this space?

150
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:33,568
Speaking of spaces, when you're designing your animation

151
00:12:34,368 --> 00:12:40,129
with VR and someone in the player,

152
00:12:40,529 --> 00:12:46,270
in the audience position, you have to think of,

153
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:47,010
there are.

154
00:12:48,104 --> 00:12:55,731
personal space, right? So there are three different types of spaces. Intimate space is really close up. It's

155
00:12:56,211 --> 00:12:57,152
think of hugging

156
00:12:58,373 --> 00:12:59,895
very close to a person.

157
00:13:00,636 --> 00:13:06,822
We try to avoid that with VR mostly because if you get that close, the character is right there,

158
00:13:07,602 --> 00:13:08,724
gets that close to you.

159
00:13:11,313 --> 00:13:18,740
basic human instinct is to like retract and like pull yourself away. So try not to get too close.

160
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:28,789
The other space is personal space and this if you think of it's within arm's range

161
00:13:30,490 --> 00:13:32,712
and you want to make sure

162
00:13:35,275 --> 00:13:36,996
it's not too close. So

163
00:13:43,176 --> 00:13:46,739
it's, yeah, it's arm's length.

164
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:53,363
And you can enter this space, your character can enter this space,

165
00:13:53,964 --> 00:14:00,368
but be careful with big movements. If your character all of a sudden

166
00:14:00,628 --> 00:14:08,014
runs up to the person in VR, to the audience,

167
00:14:08,034 --> 00:14:12,357
and they're not ready for it, they're gonna pull back.

168
00:14:12,597 --> 00:14:12,697
And...

169
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:22,716
it's possible that that's the reaction you want. But in general, we kind of don't want to scare

170
00:14:22,756 --> 00:14:28,841
people too much with our characters, right? We want them to feel comfortable. We want them to enjoy.

171
00:14:28,861 --> 00:14:32,403
But understand that

172
00:14:38,007 --> 00:14:39,788
you don't want it to be too close.

173
00:14:41,959 --> 00:14:47,183
So personal space is a good area, but you don't want to, it's the same rules,

174
00:14:47,504 --> 00:14:50,486
but you, and you can bend them a bit.

175
00:14:50,506 --> 00:14:55,710
Um, but you want to make sure that the audience is comfortable.

176
00:14:55,730 --> 00:15:01,955
Um, so maybe in that space, your, your movement for your character

177
00:15:02,095 --> 00:15:04,617
is not these big grand gestures.

178
00:15:05,298 --> 00:15:07,059
Maybe it's more subtle.

179
00:15:07,339 --> 00:15:08,180
Maybe it's.

180
00:15:09,667 --> 00:15:13,288
how normal people interact with each other next to each other.

181
00:15:13,348 --> 00:15:16,749
If you can imagine your friend standing next to you,

182
00:15:18,530 --> 00:15:22,092
what's an okay and acceptable movement for them?

183
00:15:22,832 --> 00:15:27,394
If you can imagine someone who's 20 feet away who's trying to get your attention,

184
00:15:27,414 --> 00:15:31,055
yeah, maybe it is that grand big movement.

185
00:15:31,455 --> 00:15:36,197
So be aware of distance.

186
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:44,297
and if you have a character running up to you, maybe they slow down those last couple of steps

187
00:15:45,678 --> 00:15:52,004
so that they're not gonna run into the audience. Speaking of subtlety,

188
00:15:52,024 --> 00:16:00,172
in VR, because we are maybe very close to a character, we have to take into account how

189
00:16:00,212 --> 00:16:02,434
people react. So,

190
00:16:03,536 --> 00:16:07,240
let's say your character decides that they want to whisper to you,

191
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:13,225
they're going to get really close. How do they do that? Do they jump

192
00:16:13,285 --> 00:16:17,229
towards you or do they like slowly move in and

193
00:16:17,249 --> 00:16:21,433
I need to tell you a secret, right? So

194
00:16:25,697 --> 00:16:27,499
how you plan that? How do you

195
00:16:30,047 --> 00:16:33,508
feel like it's an invitation versus

196
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,291
just, do you want your audience to lean in?

197
00:16:42,091 --> 00:16:45,552
Do you want them to just stand and watch?

198
00:16:46,213 --> 00:16:50,734
So how interactive do you want them to feel in this?

199
00:16:52,175 --> 00:16:53,755
If you want them to come closer,

200
00:16:53,775 --> 00:16:57,937
maybe don't go all the way in, right?

201
00:16:58,317 --> 00:16:59,377
Maybe have your character.

202
00:17:00,897 --> 00:17:07,521
stop at a certain point so that they have to lean towards your character.

203
00:17:07,541 --> 00:17:19,167
It's a lot to think about and there's a lot of subtlety that we didn't know we needed for wolves.

204
00:17:20,768 --> 00:17:29,092
There's a good amount of interactivity for Wolves on the Walls. You're handed some things, some

205
00:17:29,212 --> 00:17:29,573
objects.

206
00:17:30,430 --> 00:17:36,192
uh from our character and some of them she hands them straight to you

207
00:17:37,073 --> 00:17:40,274
forward right in front of you but there's a great

208
00:17:41,214 --> 00:17:44,876
section where she's looking through this chest and she doesn't

209
00:17:45,536 --> 00:17:48,217
necessarily have she's trying to look for something

210
00:17:48,237 --> 00:17:54,939
and she's not looking at you at all but the actor on stage did something

211
00:17:55,259 --> 00:17:57,660
so brilliant that no matter

212
00:17:58,630 --> 00:18:05,375
who she hands an object to or every single person we play tested every single person

213
00:18:05,855 --> 00:18:14,061
would grab for it and it was this connection that we couldn't have predicted but somehow

214
00:18:14,502 --> 00:18:23,448
the actor knew they just understood how people react and so she's not looking at you at all and

215
00:18:23,488 --> 00:18:27,271
she just hands you something and you're like oh

216
00:18:29,091 --> 00:18:30,772
I had the reaction to grab that.

217
00:18:30,832 --> 00:18:35,293
Like, it just felt like such a natural motion.

218
00:18:36,013 --> 00:18:41,395
So we don't always have to stand up front and center

219
00:18:41,435 --> 00:18:43,096
to hand an object to someone.

220
00:18:43,776 --> 00:18:46,097
We can play around with how we do that.

221
00:18:46,257 --> 00:18:48,778
And so when you're planning your animation,

222
00:18:48,818 --> 00:18:50,218
when you're really thinking about it,

223
00:18:50,779 --> 00:18:53,900
like try different things,

224
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:57,541
but also play test.

225
00:18:58,735 --> 00:19:03,957
you want to see how people react to your different animations.

226
00:19:03,977 --> 00:19:09,939
And playtesting can be as simple as, it doesn't have to be in VR, it could just

227
00:19:09,979 --> 00:19:14,940
be acting in real life with a friend

228
00:19:15,340 --> 00:19:21,262
and seeing their reaction. Because VR is so personal, it is so...

229
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:26,144
It's a one person show, right?

230
00:19:26,184 --> 00:19:27,704
Like, the person you are...

231
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:37,082
creating this animation for it is an individual, it is not a huge audience. So how does one

232
00:19:37,122 --> 00:19:43,303
individual react? And don't just try it with one person, try it with like everyone in your family

233
00:19:43,323 --> 00:19:50,565
and see how they react. And that's kind of the

234
00:19:52,580 --> 00:20:00,526
the best way to like start playtesting, start understanding your, how your animations can play

235
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:08,311
out. And so when we were building our animations and we thought we knew what we were going to do,

236
00:20:08,832 --> 00:20:16,897
we playtested in real life, but then we also playtested in VR. We had people come in and

237
00:20:17,458 --> 00:20:18,999
see what their reactions were.

238
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:22,724
And there was one section we were having troubles with because

239
00:20:24,044 --> 00:20:26,545
nobody was taking the objects that were handed

240
00:20:27,405 --> 00:20:29,846
to them. And we were just like, so what do we do?

241
00:20:30,987 --> 00:20:35,148
How do we get people to interact? How do we progress the story with people not

242
00:20:35,228 --> 00:20:39,550
taking these objects? So we had to change up

243
00:20:39,890 --> 00:20:44,291
how that section went. And so we

244
00:20:44,932 --> 00:20:45,332
ended up

245
00:20:47,168 --> 00:20:52,431
creating more animations for our project than we thought we needed.

246
00:20:53,092 --> 00:21:00,277
And it just, it shows you the playtest early and often and,

247
00:21:00,537 --> 00:21:03,499
and see where your problem points are.

248
00:21:03,519 --> 00:21:03,559
Um,

249
00:21:05,484 --> 00:21:08,725
And this was a design issue, but it was also an animation issue.

250
00:21:08,805 --> 00:21:12,928
Like, how do you get people to take something that is placed in front of you?

251
00:21:14,749 --> 00:21:21,052
And so we want people to grab for things, but maybe wiggling something in front of you,

252
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:25,654
that's not the reaction you're going to get. You're going to swipe it away.

253
00:21:26,015 --> 00:21:31,297
So that created a different chain of animations we had to make.

254
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:44,052
plan. Plan, but also playtest. It's, I can't, I can't stress that enough.

255
00:21:49,257 --> 00:21:56,985
The next thing I want to talk to you about is staging and camera. VR has no specific camera.

256
00:21:57,947 --> 00:22:05,091
It's wherever an individual chooses to stand and whatever direction they choose to stare at.

257
00:22:06,212 --> 00:22:11,575
So whatever they look at. A big thing with VR is once someone's in there,

258
00:22:11,595 --> 00:22:15,737
the first thing they do is look around everywhere, right?

259
00:22:16,277 --> 00:22:19,579
And the other thing they do is look straight up. So...

260
00:22:20,540 --> 00:22:23,502
For some reason, it's amazing.

261
00:22:23,562 --> 00:22:24,763
We have the sky above us.

262
00:22:24,943 --> 00:22:27,205
But in VR, we have to see what's above us.

263
00:22:27,325 --> 00:22:29,747
And it's instinctual.

264
00:22:31,388 --> 00:22:39,314
So for cameras in VR, I feel like I've mentioned it a bunch.

265
00:22:41,195 --> 00:22:42,636
But there is no camera, right?

266
00:22:45,058 --> 00:22:47,539
There are a few ways, though, to get

267
00:22:47,579 --> 00:22:49,561
people to look in the direction you want them to.

268
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:52,748
One way is with color and saturation.

269
00:22:54,009 --> 00:22:57,311
You can have the whole set black and white,

270
00:22:57,391 --> 00:23:00,173
and then there's color where you want them to look.

271
00:23:01,174 --> 00:23:02,335
Another is sound.

272
00:23:05,077 --> 00:23:06,918
Spatialized sound does wonders.

273
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,021
People hear something, and it's subconscious

274
00:23:10,081 --> 00:23:11,962
that they look in the direction that they hear it.

275
00:23:14,304 --> 00:23:16,245
We could also use different lighting hues.

276
00:23:17,277 --> 00:23:21,141
effects, maybe an animated character or object.

277
00:23:25,325 --> 00:23:30,290
Directing the audience to look in a specific direction so as to not miss what you want them

278
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:36,617
to see can be extremely difficult. Most people will look all around them, like I said.

279
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:40,521
In wolves, we used a few different techniques.

280
00:23:41,457 --> 00:23:45,459
We use spatialized sound, lighting, and vignetting the scenes.

281
00:23:46,879 --> 00:23:52,302
Certain areas would pop up and the rest of the set would be in total darkness.

282
00:23:54,223 --> 00:23:56,864
Essentially creating a spotlight for people to look at.

283
00:23:58,365 --> 00:24:01,947
Very much a traditional theater technique.

284
00:24:06,113 --> 00:24:09,814
that there's also ways to do that with your character animation.

285
00:24:09,834 --> 00:24:14,155
Those are all like other ways to get people to look.

286
00:24:16,095 --> 00:24:20,196
If you have a character that is like looking in one direction

287
00:24:20,256 --> 00:24:24,197
and you see them and notice them and then they walk in front of you

288
00:24:24,237 --> 00:24:28,158
and across you, you're going to look the way they're walking.

289
00:24:28,738 --> 00:24:33,699
That direction is bringing them, bringing your eye to where they are going.

290
00:24:33,719 --> 00:24:34,599
Okay.

291
00:24:37,113 --> 00:24:39,554
Be aware of personal space and where they're walking.

292
00:24:41,836 --> 00:24:46,719
I've seen some projects where the character arcs around a very specific plan.

293
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:48,680
They don't come into the personal space,

294
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,702
but you can have that character walk into the personal space.

295
00:24:53,423 --> 00:24:54,263
Be careful.

296
00:24:54,743 --> 00:24:59,906
You don't want it to be too close, but you also don't want it to feel

297
00:25:01,707 --> 00:25:02,868
like there's too much movement.

298
00:25:02,908 --> 00:25:06,250
You don't want them to overtake you. Right.

299
00:25:06,948 --> 00:25:16,330
So be wary. Test it out with your friends and family in person. And then test it out in VR.

300
00:25:17,110 --> 00:25:25,832
Have a character come that close and see how people do with that movement. Block it out,

301
00:25:26,953 --> 00:25:33,274
as it were. You don't have to have it like finely animated in order to get that feel.

302
00:25:36,370 --> 00:25:41,214
you would be surprised how many people are very comfortable with the character walking across them.

303
00:25:43,376 --> 00:25:50,041
Just no big movements, right? And speaking again of camera, I like to say that

304
00:25:51,362 --> 00:25:56,906
the bigger the gesture, the bigger the character is moving, the farther away you want them. Think

305
00:25:56,986 --> 00:26:04,011
like a wide shot or a medium shot. How much is their body actually moving, right?

306
00:26:05,937 --> 00:26:11,999
For like a medium shot, their feet are probably planted and they're just like wiggling around, right?

307
00:26:12,740 --> 00:26:15,081
For a wide shot, they could be doing cartwheels.

308
00:26:16,121 --> 00:26:18,722
They could be doing a lot more bigger movements.

309
00:26:19,983 --> 00:26:21,323
And for a close-up shot,

310
00:26:22,524 --> 00:26:29,067
they're maybe moving their shoulders. They're staying pretty like on their mark.

311
00:26:29,727 --> 00:26:30,487
They're not like...

312
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:40,452
Because if you start doing that, unless you want to show off a very like anxious character,

313
00:26:42,953 --> 00:26:53,676
people do tend to step back. So be aware of your distances there. And the farther back you have a

314
00:26:53,716 --> 00:27:00,078
character, the more you have to read. So if the character looks this big to you in the distance,

315
00:27:01,168 --> 00:27:03,549
they need bigger facial expressions, right?

316
00:27:03,929 --> 00:27:10,891
I always like to like point out like stage theater.

317
00:27:10,911 --> 00:27:15,712
A lot of the actors movements on a stage,

318
00:27:16,672 --> 00:27:18,532
they're not meant for the people in the front row,

319
00:27:18,572 --> 00:27:20,513
they're meant for the people in the back row, right?

320
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:24,734
What they do on stage has to read all the way back there,

321
00:27:24,894 --> 00:27:27,754
like all the way up in the nosebleed section.

322
00:27:28,274 --> 00:27:30,155
So you really want to like.

323
00:27:31,620 --> 00:27:39,902
play to that. There is no camera there, right? Like on a theatrical stage, there is no, like,

324
00:27:41,363 --> 00:27:47,004
well, there's several cameras and it's in each individual seat, right? So you just want to

325
00:27:47,384 --> 00:27:56,806
be aware of that. And yeah, I think I'm running up on time. I did want to

326
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:02,831
talk about the pros and cons of keyframe versus motion capture.

327
00:28:03,711 --> 00:28:06,791
I think people already know those already.

328
00:28:07,191 --> 00:28:15,533
Like keyframe, you have a lot of ability to you hit those poses and it's really freeing.

329
00:28:18,334 --> 00:28:23,675
It's, you know, there really are no bounds, boundaries.

330
00:28:24,375 --> 00:28:27,316
You have full range of what your character's poses look like.

331
00:28:28,554 --> 00:28:32,457
But the cons are you probably maybe need a very large animation team.

332
00:28:34,198 --> 00:28:38,102
For mocap, the iteration cycle is much quicker, right?

333
00:28:38,162 --> 00:28:42,345
Like if something happens on the stage and then someone sees something and like, well,

334
00:28:42,405 --> 00:28:50,772
maybe if we do this, you can take multiple takes and then make a decision later on which

335
00:28:50,852 --> 00:28:52,233
one you want to follow through with.

336
00:28:54,487 --> 00:28:58,288
And even if you use motion capture as just reference,

337
00:28:58,908 --> 00:29:01,609
it's really easy to fastly iterate that way.

338
00:29:03,670 --> 00:29:09,751
Cons of motion capture can be that it's cumbersome.

339
00:29:09,931 --> 00:29:13,792
Like, the amount of editing you have to do with mocap

340
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:17,593
can be mind boggling at times.

341
00:29:18,614 --> 00:29:20,674
And then characters have different proportions.

342
00:29:20,794 --> 00:29:21,735
Then they're actors.

343
00:29:23,627 --> 00:29:29,050
For wolves, our characters had these very large heads, so if a character raised their arm,

344
00:29:30,111 --> 00:29:35,734
you know, we had to do a lot of editing and retargeting so that that arm would not go

345
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:43,479
through their head. So it's, there's lots of pros and cons. Whatever works best for your projects.

346
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:47,201
I highly, I like both.

347
00:29:47,978 --> 00:29:49,299
I think vocab's a style.

348
00:29:49,920 --> 00:29:51,802
So, yeah.

349
00:29:52,102 --> 00:29:55,365
And that's my talk on animation for VR.

350
00:29:55,446 --> 00:29:56,687
I really hope you enjoyed it.

351
00:29:57,708 --> 00:30:00,371
If I didn't say my name before, my name is Liz Kupfer.

352
00:30:01,051 --> 00:30:03,334
And it's been fun.
