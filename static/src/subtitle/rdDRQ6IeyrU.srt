1
00:00:08,131 --> 00:00:09,852
Hello, hello, can you hear me okay?

2
00:00:11,138 --> 00:00:12,039
Good morning, everyone.

3
00:00:12,499 --> 00:00:15,841
Thank you so much for getting up and braving this early morning.

4
00:00:16,701 --> 00:00:20,563
I was worried it was going to be an empty room because of all the parties last night and get together.

5
00:00:20,623 --> 00:00:22,785
So I appreciate so much seeing all of you here.

6
00:00:23,265 --> 00:00:24,886
Got the most essential items here.

7
00:00:24,966 --> 00:00:28,608
Got coffee, got a clicker, and I got a little presentation.

8
00:00:28,748 --> 00:00:30,289
So we'll try and go over that.

9
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:38,274
So in case you didn't read the label over there, we're going to talk about the first 30 years of Warcraft.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:41,551
I hope that there will be information that will be helpful for all of you.

11
00:00:41,571 --> 00:00:43,172
So why don't we kick it off with a movie.

12
00:01:26,519 --> 00:01:31,103
Go buy World of Warcraft, install it on your computer, and join the online sensation before we all murder you.

13
00:01:31,744 --> 00:01:36,768
All right, all right then.

14
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:40,792
Welcome to the World of Warcraft.

15
00:01:43,475 --> 00:01:46,037
I'm William Shatner, and I'm a shaman.

16
00:01:48,219 --> 00:01:50,662
I'm Mr. T, and this is my knight, Elf Mohawk.

17
00:01:52,813 --> 00:01:53,533
Shut up, fool!

18
00:01:54,294 --> 00:01:58,276
This role-playing game, where heroes like Leroy Jenkins do battle.

19
00:01:58,316 --> 00:02:01,358
Leroy Jenkins!

20
00:02:01,738 --> 00:02:03,659
That would be the world of Warcraft.

21
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:10,443
You're a player in the NFL, but what you're most proud of is that you've rated third nationally in dungeon progression.

22
00:02:12,964 --> 00:02:15,786
Climbing was perfect!

23
00:02:16,906 --> 00:02:17,787
That was fire.

24
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:27,156
For the Alliance!

25
00:02:28,917 --> 00:02:31,398
For the Horde!

26
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,321
For Azeroth!

27
00:02:40,683 --> 00:02:41,563
Ready to work.

28
00:02:53,498 --> 00:02:59,365
So just as Warcraft is celebrating 30 years, it's been about 30 years for me as well.

29
00:02:59,405 --> 00:03:01,507
I'll tell you a little bit of my background.

30
00:03:01,988 --> 00:03:10,358
I didn't start originally on Warcraft, although I did start playing back with Warcraft the RTS and then I played in the beta for World of Warcraft.

31
00:03:10,458 --> 00:03:12,400
And I've been with Blizzard 12 years now.

32
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:23,733
I started out first on Mists of Pandaria as a lead producer, and then spent a little bit of time over on Diablo III, and brought it over to console, and then did Reaper of Souls.

33
00:03:24,654 --> 00:03:29,140
Killed the auction house, sorry about that, for all of you that had investments in that.

34
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,421
But hopefully the rest of you were happy.

35
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,421
of the game.

36
00:03:47,132 --> 00:03:56,994
It's really kind of special and cool for me to be here at GDC because a couple of those games really happened because of the meetings and people that I met here at GDC.

37
00:03:57,674 --> 00:04:03,255
I was walking these halls when I first ran into a guy named Mike Booth with a little game called Nox.

38
00:04:04,115 --> 00:04:05,076
We made that together.

39
00:04:05,136 --> 00:04:09,196
Mike went on to do great things, including Left 4 Dead, which I'm sure you've heard of.

40
00:04:10,017 --> 00:04:10,797
At least I hope you have.

41
00:04:12,702 --> 00:04:18,806
Also at the IGF, I was looking at a lot of student projects and became enamored with one called Cloud.

42
00:04:19,366 --> 00:04:25,270
And that led me to meet Genova Chin and Kelly Santiago, and we started that game company.

43
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:27,211
I incubated that when I was at Sony.

44
00:04:27,311 --> 00:04:35,816
So for all of you that are out there with your hopes and dreams and your game that you want to do, I encourage you to network, meet people.

45
00:04:35,976 --> 00:04:38,198
I think this is a great place to do it.

46
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,911
In addition to the games that I've worked on, my educational background, I have a degree in computer science from the University of New Mexico.

47
00:04:47,611 --> 00:04:51,732
Probably not any Lobos out there, but if you're out there, put your hands up.

48
00:04:51,832 --> 00:04:52,372
OK, I knew that.

49
00:04:54,413 --> 00:04:58,293
And then later in my career, I went back and got my MBA.

50
00:04:59,014 --> 00:05:01,414
And that was at USC Marshall School of Business.

51
00:05:02,594 --> 00:05:06,235
Wrote a book on project management and ended up teaching out of that book.

52
00:05:06,898 --> 00:05:10,560
at the Interactive Media Division of Cinematic School at USC.

53
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:17,782
Some of the students I worked with have gone on to do some pretty cool games, so it's been a great experience for me there.

54
00:05:17,802 --> 00:05:22,144
I've also was on the board for the AIS, so that's DICE.

55
00:05:23,905 --> 00:05:25,446
I think that kind of sums up me.

56
00:05:26,146 --> 00:05:29,027
Why don't we get on to the stuff we really want to talk about, which is Warcraft.

57
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:40,803
So Warcraft, the universe, our mission is to build a fantasy universe that delights and connects everyone, everywhere.

58
00:05:42,617 --> 00:05:45,519
And so we chose our words carefully.

59
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:51,563
I mean, for us, that fantasy universe means, I can't even read my own notes here.

60
00:05:52,924 --> 00:05:57,007
It means that we essentially want to tell deep and cool stories.

61
00:05:57,508 --> 00:05:58,489
We want to be engaging.

62
00:05:58,949 --> 00:06:07,615
And in delighting, it's important to us that the game not only be a little dangerous, there has to be challenges, but there's an element of humor.

63
00:06:07,915 --> 00:06:11,138
And that distinguishes us from a lot of other games out there.

64
00:06:12,297 --> 00:06:17,539
Connecting is important for us, as we found, and I'll talk about through the journey of building Warcraft.

65
00:06:17,999 --> 00:06:27,743
It's that building a community, bringing people together, people that you might not have otherwise met in real life you'll meet in our games.

66
00:06:28,443 --> 00:06:37,947
And we want to make sure that the games themselves, the content, and the communities that we foster are inclusive, that you can be who you want to be, and multicultural.

67
00:06:39,168 --> 00:06:41,449
And then the last part, we want to be everywhere.

68
00:06:41,989 --> 00:06:46,570
And if you'll notice, there's elements of mythology from across the globe.

69
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:52,891
But we operate 24-7 across the entire planet in many, many languages and cultures.

70
00:06:53,431 --> 00:06:58,633
And we think it's a cool way to get in touch with other communities, other cultures.

71
00:06:58,673 --> 00:07:07,315
And we pride ourselves in trying to make our games feel like they were actually made for the regions or the countries that we publish in.

72
00:07:07,355 --> 00:07:08,655
Even when we do localization, we'll

73
00:07:09,255 --> 00:07:15,458
you know, the little jokes that we tell that, you know, if you're playing here in North America, you know, you'll probably understand them.

74
00:07:15,478 --> 00:07:24,343
But if we did a literal translation of them to, you know, other countries, you know, Germany or, you know, Peru, it wouldn't make as much sense.

75
00:07:24,583 --> 00:07:30,926
So our localization teams actually try to still have an element of humor, but a joke that makes sense in their culture.

76
00:07:37,417 --> 00:07:46,342
So these are essentially the games that we have released, including the WoW expansions, over our 30-year history for Warcraft.

77
00:07:47,882 --> 00:07:51,664
Warcraft itself is celebrating its 30 years coming this November.

78
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:56,007
World of Warcraft is celebrating 20 years in operation.

79
00:07:56,367 --> 00:07:57,827
And again, this is in November.

80
00:07:59,588 --> 00:08:02,050
Hearthstone is celebrating its 10-year anniversary.

81
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,452
And Rumble, our newest baby, is going to be one year old in November.

82
00:08:07,742 --> 00:08:20,245
So I'm going to walk through some of the pivotal milestones that we've had through the creation of these games, and then later kind of connect that all together and talk about how we feel that this led to some of our successes.

83
00:08:20,765 --> 00:08:24,526
And I also want to share with you a big mistake that we made.

84
00:08:28,247 --> 00:08:31,308
So Warcraft, the RTS, started in 1994.

85
00:08:33,944 --> 00:08:36,486
We were playing a lot of real-time strategy games.

86
00:08:36,546 --> 00:08:38,729
The genre was just starting to happen.

87
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,192
Up until that point, a lot of people were playing turn-based games.

88
00:08:42,552 --> 00:08:44,975
A lot of them were adaptations of board games.

89
00:08:45,635 --> 00:08:55,865
And so this notion of having real-time strategy games where you click on units, they go do the thing, and you're not pressing a turn button was still relatively novel.

90
00:08:57,675 --> 00:08:58,556
We love the genre.

91
00:08:58,696 --> 00:09:00,858
We wanted to be able to make a game in that genre.

92
00:09:01,459 --> 00:09:09,948
So we actually chose the fantasy setting for it, because at that time, most of the RTS games were actually sci-fi or military in nature.

93
00:09:09,968 --> 00:09:13,091
And that turned out to be a pretty important distinction for us down the road.

94
00:09:13,992 --> 00:09:17,695
It's also important that in an RTS game, there's a very clear conflict.

95
00:09:17,855 --> 00:09:21,418
And so we thought, OK, in a fantasy setting, it's got to be orcs versus humans.

96
00:09:21,498 --> 00:09:29,044
There's a lot of literature that has established that longstanding rivalry, and in our case, competition for resources.

97
00:09:29,684 --> 00:09:33,207
So we thought that would be a very simple concept to start with.

98
00:09:35,013 --> 00:09:36,654
And there it is in all of its glory.

99
00:09:37,934 --> 00:09:42,757
For those of you that played Warcraft like I did, that's what it looked like when it first came out.

100
00:09:43,797 --> 00:09:48,400
If you look at the play screen down below, the little green blobs are the orcs.

101
00:09:48,860 --> 00:09:54,763
They're busily harvesting things, chopping down wood, what have you, building their village.

102
00:09:55,203 --> 00:09:56,824
But along comes the little blue blob.

103
00:09:56,844 --> 00:09:58,705
Well, that represents the humans.

104
00:09:58,845 --> 00:10:00,846
And of course, they're intruding on their territory.

105
00:10:00,966 --> 00:10:02,447
And thus, the conflict begins.

106
00:10:03,367 --> 00:10:07,510
The early Warcraft game, you could play solo in campaigns, but you could also play with friends.

107
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:16,718
I remember it wasn't quite as convenient as it is today, but I remember hooking up, you know, my computer over LAN with my neighbor and introducing everybody in my neighborhood at Warcraft.

108
00:10:18,619 --> 00:10:25,745
The storytelling was in the form of mission briefings, which you see in that upper corner, and it was voiceover, but it was, you know, the scrolling text.

109
00:10:27,818 --> 00:10:43,702
So we had a lot of success with Warcraft, did a sequel to it, and could have kind of just stayed there, but a lot of cool stuff was happening in the industry, not the least of which was 3D cards.

110
00:10:44,102 --> 00:10:47,523
When this came out, people didn't really have 3D cards on their computers.

111
00:10:48,243 --> 00:10:56,025
So in the late 90s, mid 90s, that's when they really started to become more prevalent, and we did Warcraft III.

112
00:10:57,220 --> 00:11:00,141
One of the first big events of it was going full 3D with it.

113
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:02,242
So now the camera could come down a little bit.

114
00:11:02,282 --> 00:11:07,744
You'd see a little bit of the shadows and volume of your units, a little more detail, higher resolution.

115
00:11:08,164 --> 00:11:09,784
The action was cooler.

116
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:14,446
We also wanted to tell more story.

117
00:11:14,886 --> 00:11:16,687
So up until this point, it's missions, right?

118
00:11:16,747 --> 00:11:21,668
Go do this, go harvest that, go take down this human settlement.

119
00:11:22,529 --> 00:11:25,950
But we wanted to tell a deeper story to help you feel more connected

120
00:11:26,782 --> 00:11:28,483
to what was going on in the game itself.

121
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:34,406
And that led to creating these, what Blizzard would later become pretty famous for, is our pre-rendered cinematics.

122
00:11:34,546 --> 00:11:36,407
We use those for the announcement of games.

123
00:11:37,007 --> 00:11:38,968
Sorry, I'm going to go over here because I can't see some of you there.

124
00:11:39,028 --> 00:11:40,869
Thank you for coming in and sitting up front.

125
00:11:40,929 --> 00:11:41,689
I appreciate it.

126
00:11:43,150 --> 00:11:44,751
But we use that for the announcement of our games.

127
00:11:45,091 --> 00:11:48,253
We use that in between missions to kind of propel the story along.

128
00:11:48,793 --> 00:11:52,495
And to give it another connection, we added heroes to Warcraft 3.

129
00:11:53,196 --> 00:11:59,939
That was kind of an important decision because now you have these key story characters that we could tie everything to.

130
00:12:00,439 --> 00:12:02,881
It was a lot of what they were trying to accomplish.

131
00:12:03,361 --> 00:12:07,583
And you, as the general above, were ordering the troops around to help them, essentially.

132
00:12:09,424 --> 00:12:10,205
But one of the really

133
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:18,690
smart things we did, because, oh, I forgot to mention, we also had much deeper gameplay on this.

134
00:12:18,810 --> 00:12:29,993
We now had 12 different factions that could play in these maps, which, by the way, I got an interesting story from Chris Metzen, who was one of the, at that time, one of the story writers.

135
00:12:31,293 --> 00:12:34,313
We had all these different colors, 12 different colors for all the units, right?

136
00:12:34,693 --> 00:12:37,394
And you literally went on a menu and you picked pink or blue,

137
00:12:37,914 --> 00:12:38,414
or yellow.

138
00:12:38,854 --> 00:12:40,535
And he thought, man, this is boring as heck.

139
00:12:41,015 --> 00:12:47,977
So he took each of those colors and he turned them into the various factions, which would later be the regions of Azeroth.

140
00:12:48,017 --> 00:12:52,898
So you can thank him for the fact that Twilight's Hammer is called that instead of pink.

141
00:12:55,098 --> 00:13:00,520
But anyway, the other thing that we did is, as multiplayer caught on and we could see, oh, this is pretty cool.

142
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,960
There's a real multiplayer community.

143
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,901
We thought, how do we extend this?

144
00:13:04,941 --> 00:13:05,121
So

145
00:13:06,159 --> 00:13:10,361
we created a very robust mod system for the game.

146
00:13:10,741 --> 00:13:16,904
And that allowed our players to not only build maps to extend the game, but also games within the game.

147
00:13:17,385 --> 00:13:24,949
And what you're looking at there is a game, or a mod, and a very popular one for Warcraft III called Defense of the Ancients, or DOTA.

148
00:13:25,749 --> 00:13:31,292
So this mod actually gave rise to the whole MOBA genre, and also tower defense.

149
00:13:32,214 --> 00:13:33,295
So it was really powerful.

150
00:13:33,476 --> 00:13:35,038
It allowed an extension of the game.

151
00:13:36,179 --> 00:13:42,126
Warcraft 3 was, by all accounts, one of the most popular RTSs of the time.

152
00:13:43,628 --> 00:13:44,990
So where do we go next with this?

153
00:13:45,150 --> 00:13:46,392
Do we continue to build this?

154
00:13:46,452 --> 00:13:47,753
Do we continue to extend this?

155
00:13:48,967 --> 00:13:53,809
We're really excited about, you know, 3D and what could be done with it.

156
00:13:54,550 --> 00:14:02,113
I mean, when we're building RTS, you have this God's eye view of, you know, the map, watching the soldiers below.

157
00:14:02,494 --> 00:14:05,355
But what if you could be one of them?

158
00:14:05,975 --> 00:14:11,598
What if instead of from above, the game is built in such a way that you're part of that universe?

159
00:14:13,302 --> 00:14:15,244
and we loved MMOs at the time.

160
00:14:15,284 --> 00:14:25,574
We were playing them and we were like, hey, you know, we've seen by creating a platform in the game that we can have multiple games inside essentially the same universe.

161
00:14:26,174 --> 00:14:29,918
But MMOs would give us the opportunity to really immerse players

162
00:14:30,565 --> 00:14:48,917
you know it's like cyber space is here and it was it was exciting for us to feel like hey we could be part of this this could be the future and we could have a lot of different gameplay inside of our game by taking Warcraft to an MMO so how does Warcraft become an MMO

163
00:14:51,843 --> 00:15:00,990
Initially, you know, I mean, MMOs based on role-playing games, you know, you typically level up to max level, you finish the story campaign, and you're kind of done.

164
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:08,995
But the interesting and cool thing about MMOs is that you can extend that by having a lot of multiplayer interaction.

165
00:15:09,776 --> 00:15:13,359
And so for us, it was coming up with, you know, cool things for people to do together.

166
00:15:13,939 --> 00:15:18,983
So that, you know, you level up to max, but then you go on and do raids and dungeons.

167
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:23,001
and a lot of activity together.

168
00:15:24,102 --> 00:15:28,804
And essentially, you forge connections with people that you would otherwise have never met.

169
00:15:30,744 --> 00:15:34,586
And that was something really powerful about World of Warcraft.

170
00:15:36,227 --> 00:15:38,007
So how did that change us?

171
00:15:38,427 --> 00:15:42,129
How did that change, in some ways, the industry?

172
00:15:43,974 --> 00:15:50,755
So when we released World of Warcraft, the internet was really just kind of happening for a lot of people.

173
00:15:51,395 --> 00:15:56,577
They were doing AOL chat rooms up until that point, text-based, text-based MUDs.

174
00:15:57,237 --> 00:16:08,959
So this was an opportunity for them to literally go into a world, be completely immersed in it, have a 3D avatar in a 360-degree world, and interact with people.

175
00:16:09,823 --> 00:16:09,943
know

176
00:16:30,558 --> 00:16:33,259
Wow became a lifestyle for many people.

177
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:40,582
I mean, some of you already, and I appreciate you've come up to me and told me the stories about how Wow brought you together, made you friends.

178
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:45,965
And it was a really powerful thing for us as a company.

179
00:16:46,165 --> 00:16:47,666
And it absolutely changed us.

180
00:16:47,866 --> 00:16:52,488
The very first BlizzCon that we had was for Burning Crusade.

181
00:16:52,528 --> 00:16:55,309
It was the first expansion that we had for World of Warcraft.

182
00:16:57,452 --> 00:17:03,114
I was talking to one of the original developers the other night, and I said, tell me about those experiences.

183
00:17:03,174 --> 00:17:12,198
And he said, you know, what was really interesting for us is that when we went to BlizzCon, we didn't know if it was going to be a success or not.

184
00:17:12,918 --> 00:17:18,681
But thousands of people were descending on the Anaheim Convention Center, and it blew them away.

185
00:17:18,741 --> 00:17:21,362
And the developers were staring and looking at each other.

186
00:17:21,382 --> 00:17:25,824
It's like, oh my gosh, all these people here for us?

187
00:17:27,258 --> 00:17:31,399
what they quickly realized is all those people were there for each other.

188
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,722
And we went from being a game developer to being the caretakers of a community.

189
00:17:39,582 --> 00:17:44,784
I mean, it was a daunting realization to us that we no longer owned this game exclusively.

190
00:17:46,004 --> 00:17:47,785
All of you, some of you, they've played it.

191
00:17:48,748 --> 00:17:50,568
where that community is your game.

192
00:17:50,648 --> 00:17:58,750
And now we had to take great care in how we were the stewards of your world, your lifestyle.

193
00:18:05,672 --> 00:18:12,953
So this recounts some of the expansions that we've released over time for World of Warcraft.

194
00:18:13,233 --> 00:18:15,574
We have one coming up as well.

195
00:18:18,605 --> 00:18:18,926
really

196
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:45,832
you know, that experience that they first had when they first joined WoW, that sense of discovery, that sense of playing together again.

197
00:18:46,492 --> 00:19:00,955
Because many of the things that we had done to make WoW more convenient to play, and many of these things are asked for by our player community, had actually, in the minds of some, especially some of the old timers, like me,

198
00:19:02,116 --> 00:19:03,797
had weakened some of those social bonds.

199
00:19:04,077 --> 00:19:16,204
That making the game a little bit more difficult, a little more dangerous, a little bit harder to actually, which seems counterintuitive, making it a little bit harder to actually get to meet people, made it easier to make it stick.

200
00:19:17,064 --> 00:19:23,808
And so, largely at the urging of our fans, we released, or re-released this.

201
00:19:23,928 --> 00:19:26,570
We took an evolutionary step back to

202
00:19:36,072 --> 00:19:39,139
Someone once said that you can't go home again.

203
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,964
But they lacked vision.

204
00:19:43,007 --> 00:19:44,470
And a temporal discombobulator.

205
00:20:34,820 --> 00:20:34,961
I'm

206
00:20:53,822 --> 00:20:59,108
So Warcraft Classic was certainly not something we anticipated.

207
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:03,914
We've now had, we've re-released two of the expansions for it.

208
00:21:04,454 --> 00:21:08,860
It's a very vibrant community for us, and really a second community for WoW.

209
00:21:11,288 --> 00:21:11,348
we

210
00:21:34,437 --> 00:21:34,497
we

211
00:21:53,509 --> 00:21:56,350
but they're informed by our community.

212
00:21:56,810 --> 00:22:04,473
I think one of the funniest things is that we went back and we took a lot of effort to fix bugs, things that were broken in the old WoW.

213
00:22:05,053 --> 00:22:07,293
And we had players tell us, no, don't fix that bug.

214
00:22:07,714 --> 00:22:09,734
That's a pretty cool exploit.

215
00:22:09,834 --> 00:22:11,935
So we'd go back in and reintroduce the bug.

216
00:22:13,378 --> 00:22:17,199
But it was a really cool experience for us.

217
00:22:17,739 --> 00:22:24,081
It's really awesome for us to be able to have two communities in WoW, one reliving the past, so to speak.

218
00:22:24,821 --> 00:22:27,562
And for some people, it's their first experience.

219
00:22:27,642 --> 00:22:32,163
They chose to go into WoW Classic as the first WoW that they've ever played.

220
00:22:33,463 --> 00:22:35,904
So we talked a lot about WoW.

221
00:22:36,504 --> 00:22:39,665
So what are some of the other expressions that we've had of Warcraft?

222
00:22:41,454 --> 00:22:45,357
like our love for RTSs and then our love for MMOs.

223
00:22:45,878 --> 00:22:51,903
One of the things that we loved playing at Blizzard was TCGs, or trading card games.

224
00:22:52,083 --> 00:22:53,964
Magic the Gathering was super popular.

225
00:22:54,325 --> 00:23:02,892
We actually did our own Magic the Gathering type game, trading card game, in the form of a World of Warcraft trading game.

226
00:23:03,672 --> 00:23:06,174
And so that led to the creation of Hearthstone.

227
00:23:06,575 --> 00:23:09,497
This was Project Pegasus internally.

228
00:23:10,807 --> 00:23:22,370
and the challenge for us is how do we make this physical game, because up until that point there really wasn't a digital TCG, how do we turn that into a really cool digital game?

229
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:30,292
How can we take advantage of that technology and do something that would be hard to do in a paper game?

230
00:23:33,102 --> 00:23:35,563
We actually took inspiration from Warcraft.

231
00:23:36,003 --> 00:23:42,404
So the foundation for it was to look at the various classes of WoW and create, you know, the card families for Hearthstone.

232
00:23:42,444 --> 00:23:44,945
And it turned out to be, you know, it worked out really well.

233
00:23:45,825 --> 00:23:47,405
It also created a great connection.

234
00:23:47,425 --> 00:23:55,847
If you'd never played WoW, if you understood the card families in Hearthstone, you could make that transition to WoW and kind of get, oh, I know what a hunter is all about.

235
00:23:55,887 --> 00:24:00,288
They're going to summon a bunch of beasts, or at least they're going to have a beast, you know, or, you know, warriors or, you know,

236
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:05,751
got a lot of armor on them and they can do a lot of damage, but they also have to take a lot of damage.

237
00:24:06,791 --> 00:24:10,253
And that became sort of the foundation of how we design Hearthstone.

238
00:24:11,814 --> 00:24:23,300
Some of the ways in which we, you know, things that we did inside of Hearthstone that you really couldn't do practically on a regular card game is we actually have some cards that allow you to make duplicates of whatever's in your opponent's deck.

239
00:24:23,761 --> 00:24:28,163
You can imagine how messy that would be if you were trying to do that, you know, at a card tournament.

240
00:24:30,147 --> 00:24:34,508
But Hearthstone brought millions of players to play billions of matches.

241
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:42,710
It initially released on PC, and then we moved it to tablet, and then on into mobile.

242
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:47,191
Here you can see some of the extensions we've made to Hearthstone.

243
00:24:47,692 --> 00:24:57,214
Over its 10-year history, we've actually done 26 different expansions for it, five different adventures on top of the original card set.

244
00:25:05,209 --> 00:25:12,492
We've had over 150 million people play Hearthstone in 158 billion games.

245
00:25:13,473 --> 00:25:17,855
And Hearthstone, just last week, celebrated its 10th birthday.

246
00:25:18,255 --> 00:25:20,436
So, happy birthday, Hearthstone.

247
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:28,638
So we were intrigued by mobile as a platform.

248
00:25:28,819 --> 00:25:31,140
I mean, a lot of us were playing mobile games.

249
00:25:31,840 --> 00:25:37,142
And we were certainly emboldened by the success of Hearthstone on mobile.

250
00:25:37,482 --> 00:25:42,765
It's like, how would we envision a game built from the ground up for mobile?

251
00:25:43,765 --> 00:25:47,947
So we went back to our strategy roots, and we made Warcraft Rumble.

252
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:55,484
Rumble was actually game directed and led by folks from the WoW team.

253
00:25:56,064 --> 00:26:02,268
So while it has strategy roots in it, you'll see a lot of elements of WoW in Rumble.

254
00:26:03,069 --> 00:26:05,871
Rumble, if you haven't played it, I encourage you to do it.

255
00:26:05,971 --> 00:26:09,213
But you're essentially picking leaders.

256
00:26:09,273 --> 00:26:10,794
You're building troop armies.

257
00:26:12,535 --> 00:26:19,100
You go on these maps and essentially try to take down your opponent's home tower, so to speak.

258
00:26:20,076 --> 00:26:20,136
in

259
00:26:39,095 --> 00:26:42,577
But Rumble was, you know, we just released it in November.

260
00:26:43,598 --> 00:26:55,166
It was a really cool exploration for us to get into mobiles, and it's actually taught us some things that we brought back to how we regard the support of our games, both WoW and Hearthstone.

261
00:26:56,226 --> 00:26:59,949
And, like Hearthstone, has that element of whimsy and humor in it.

262
00:27:02,572 --> 00:27:10,116
So now I want to tell you a little bit about the philosophies and decisions that we made that we think contributed to our success.

263
00:27:12,777 --> 00:27:22,062
The five areas I want to cover are setting, visual style, story, our evolving gameplay, and then our community.

264
00:27:24,013 --> 00:27:32,819
So the setting turned out to be a really important choice for us because that classic fantasy setting is very familiar to people.

265
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:40,364
It also gives you a technology that is reasonably easy to understand.

266
00:27:41,084 --> 00:27:55,633
Everybody knows, or hopefully everybody knows how to wield a sword and a shield or a bow, as opposed to science fiction which sometimes has to explain what it's all about, how do you use the weaponry that's in it.

267
00:27:56,953 --> 00:28:07,960
It's also, medieval fantasy's been expressed over many, many decades in literature, in film, and so people understood that, they could get into it, super accessible.

268
00:28:09,542 --> 00:28:10,862
And it has global appeal.

269
00:28:11,382 --> 00:28:21,085
I mentioned earlier, but while we base a lot of it on Western mythology, we put a lot of Eastern influences in our particular brand of fantasy.

270
00:28:23,825 --> 00:28:31,167
And the visual style, we could have gone strictly photorealistic.

271
00:28:31,387 --> 00:28:36,368
3D cards, when Warcraft first came out, were just becoming the rage.

272
00:28:36,849 --> 00:28:40,671
but they were improving literally every six months.

273
00:28:41,451 --> 00:28:48,754
How many of you went out and spent a lot of money, bought your first 3D card, I got my NVIDIA Riva, only to find it obsoleted within a year?

274
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:49,734
It's like, oh man.

275
00:28:50,455 --> 00:28:54,637
Well, the same thing was happening with the visuals that people were creating for those games.

276
00:28:54,717 --> 00:29:02,540
And when you approach photoreal, especially over a course of a lengthy lifespan that Warcraft has had,

277
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,881
You quickly get kind of outmoded.

278
00:29:04,901 --> 00:29:06,081
Your graphics look dated.

279
00:29:06,322 --> 00:29:10,383
And we wanted to make sure that they didn't look dated, that they would be timeless for us.

280
00:29:11,244 --> 00:29:12,965
So that turned out to be a really good choice for us.

281
00:29:13,025 --> 00:29:17,867
We also could have gone cartoony, but we wanted to appeal to a little bit older audience.

282
00:29:17,947 --> 00:29:21,708
We didn't want it to be seen as a kid's game, very much a social game.

283
00:29:21,748 --> 00:29:24,089
It is a family game, certainly in World of Warcraft.

284
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:28,812
But by and large, we wanted to make sure that people still saw it as somewhat serious.

285
00:29:29,472 --> 00:29:31,873
And so we went for this stylized look.

286
00:29:33,162 --> 00:29:37,903
bulky shoulders, which looks great when you're putting armor on it, right?

287
00:29:38,464 --> 00:29:44,305
A lot of, in the animation of our characters, squash and stretch, so it had a lot of personality.

288
00:29:44,885 --> 00:29:48,666
And this actually kind of became the Blizzard look.

289
00:29:49,127 --> 00:29:55,748
One of our goals is that when you see somebody playing one of our games, that people look over and say, hey, is that Rumble?

290
00:29:55,929 --> 00:29:58,229
Is that, wow, is that Hearthstone?

291
00:29:58,289 --> 00:30:01,010
Because it's a very distinctive look for our games.

292
00:30:04,292 --> 00:30:11,535
And you can see how each game kind of interprets or reinterprets the style of a character.

293
00:30:11,575 --> 00:30:13,155
In this case, this is Jaina Proudmoore.

294
00:30:13,576 --> 00:30:15,936
That's how she appeared in the original Warcraft III.

295
00:30:16,357 --> 00:30:19,978
And over the course of our games, how she's expressed.

296
00:30:20,318 --> 00:30:25,400
So she looks different, but you can still see the key things that make her Jaina.

297
00:30:29,562 --> 00:30:30,262
And then story.

298
00:30:31,714 --> 00:30:31,774
you

299
00:30:54,783 --> 00:30:58,084
People aren't ingesting the story in the same way as they would a movie.

300
00:30:58,124 --> 00:31:01,685
It's not a linear experience where it's like, OK, two hours, I'm in.

301
00:31:01,765 --> 00:31:03,905
I know what's going on with every one of these characters.

302
00:31:04,706 --> 00:31:06,446
And you're following the plot to the end.

303
00:31:06,826 --> 00:31:11,447
You may be interrupted by hours, weeks, months in your play experience.

304
00:31:11,647 --> 00:31:13,268
So how do we keep that thread together?

305
00:31:13,348 --> 00:31:20,910
And having those key story characters sort of propel it so they always had some big conflict that they're dealing with, sometimes

306
00:31:21,950 --> 00:31:28,774
an existential threat to our planet, Azeroth, or maybe just, you know, they have a real beef with each other.

307
00:31:29,114 --> 00:31:37,339
And you're the heroes in there, assisting these leaders, but you understand both the conflict and the world around you.

308
00:31:39,400 --> 00:31:44,943
You see here, Arthas, he was in the Frozen Throne in Warcraft the RTS.

309
00:31:45,677 --> 00:31:52,841
He certainly was the center of the Lich King, Wrath of the Lich King, which is what our classic players are playing right now.

310
00:31:53,681 --> 00:31:58,724
That was, I think, one of our more poignant stories about how power corrupts.

311
00:32:03,526 --> 00:32:04,687
So evolving gameplay.

312
00:32:05,677 --> 00:32:24,527
What we've done through the course of time is to either take existing genres or even games that we've had ourselves and iterate on those, but always find a way to reduce the complexity in playing those games, make them more accessible, and experiment with new modes of play.

313
00:32:25,948 --> 00:32:29,150
And we like to iterate on that proven gameplay.

314
00:32:32,481 --> 00:32:38,107
And finally, and this has really been the most important thing for us, is community.

315
00:32:39,189 --> 00:32:51,463
We behave as the caretakers of, you know, some people told me, you know, you own my childhood, but we're the caretakers of their community, of their lifestyle, and we take that seriously.

316
00:32:53,045 --> 00:32:59,791
And what has helped us is through the course of taking care of that community, we've grown through a network effect.

317
00:33:00,192 --> 00:33:03,135
People invite their friends to be part of the game.

318
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:06,418
People incorporate that in their lifestyle.

319
00:33:06,898 --> 00:33:15,686
That becomes something that they get together, they do on a Tuesday night, and there's a little bit of almost pressure from your friends, like, oh, we're going to go do this thing together.

320
00:33:16,427 --> 00:33:20,110
but then you also know you have a place to go and you have a way to connect with people.

321
00:33:21,011 --> 00:33:31,419
You can make friends, you know, across borders, across cultural, you know, differences, and that's a really important aspect of our game, and especially, wow.

322
00:33:32,680 --> 00:33:36,964
And then we, you know, we try to keep the games fresh through regular content updates.

323
00:33:42,854 --> 00:33:48,136
So this just kind of sums up the things that we attribute to the success of our franchise.

324
00:33:49,257 --> 00:33:59,501
So now I want to talk a little bit about a more recent case study on how things maybe didn't work out for us.

325
00:34:00,301 --> 00:34:04,743
So if you look at, this is the subscriber curve for World of Warcraft.

326
00:34:05,513 --> 00:34:12,516
We have a really predictable pattern where every time an expansion would come out, a lot of people would come in to play that expansion.

327
00:34:13,317 --> 00:34:26,023
They'd reunite with their friends, they'd level up, they'd get through a lot of the content, they might down a raid boss, and a substantial group of them would continue on all the way through the expansion and on to the next one.

328
00:34:26,663 --> 00:34:28,985
And this isn't a steady state, right?

329
00:34:29,005 --> 00:34:31,147
We have a constant inflow and outflow.

330
00:34:32,127 --> 00:34:38,713
We literally have almost as many new players coming in as other players going out, the churn, so to speak.

331
00:34:39,413 --> 00:34:41,035
But they always would come back.

332
00:34:41,475 --> 00:34:47,620
Every expansion we released, pretty much, it was very predictable, the same number of folks would come back.

333
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:55,189
And then when we released Classic, you can see we actually, in between expansion releases, had another big peak.

334
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:59,733
So we brought back, or we created, a new community of players.

335
00:35:00,453 --> 00:35:07,918
And if you notice that that actually led to, when we saw that tapering off after the release, we're now at a higher level.

336
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:14,063
So when Shadowlands came out, very high and healthy subscriber base for the game.

337
00:35:17,195 --> 00:35:24,917
So as we're heading into, all right, we're gonna do the next two expansions for Classic, and we're gonna release Dragonflight.

338
00:35:25,697 --> 00:35:28,318
So this is what we expected to see as a result of that.

339
00:35:28,798 --> 00:35:38,921
Now we recognize that, you know, okay, Shadowlands came out during COVID, and so that might've been a little bit higher, but we expected Dragonflight, especially with the, you know, remember this is the overall subscriber base.

340
00:35:40,261 --> 00:35:44,022
We expected that to still be a really strong, healthy showing.

341
00:35:45,483 --> 00:35:46,563
That's what we got.

342
00:35:48,318 --> 00:35:51,520
and I put Professor Putricide in there if you played.

343
00:35:52,300 --> 00:35:55,802
He rarely means good news, even though he talks about good news a lot.

344
00:35:56,523 --> 00:35:57,883
And this was not good news for us.

345
00:35:58,464 --> 00:36:03,727
Instead of seeing that big healthy peak at Dragonflight, it was much lower.

346
00:36:04,808 --> 00:36:13,733
And a lot of that was attributed to people losing their interest, and even in some cases, their trust in us during Shadowlands.

347
00:36:16,929 --> 00:36:17,709
So what went wrong?

348
00:36:18,470 --> 00:36:21,010
I mean, we did surveys of our players.

349
00:36:21,271 --> 00:36:22,291
We looked at forums.

350
00:36:24,272 --> 00:36:25,532
We had a community council.

351
00:36:25,612 --> 00:36:26,572
We consulted with them.

352
00:36:27,093 --> 00:36:28,733
We consulted ourselves.

353
00:36:28,813 --> 00:36:29,873
A lot of us are players.

354
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:32,314
And we just got real about it.

355
00:36:33,115 --> 00:36:45,399
And ironic that some of the things that went wrong for us are some of the things that we felt led to our success, that we might have strayed from the things that we believe so strongly.

356
00:36:46,598 --> 00:36:48,880
So first off was the story and setting.

357
00:36:49,741 --> 00:36:55,928
In Shadowlands, you're essentially going to a place that was never expressed in the RTS, but it's this afterlife.

358
00:36:56,769 --> 00:37:00,293
And players felt like they were a stranger in a strange land.

359
00:37:01,394 --> 00:37:08,101
We had similar concepts with Burning Crusade and Legion, but this felt pretty alien to our players.

360
00:37:09,447 --> 00:37:18,142
And Azeroth, which is the place that they'd leveled up and they'd spent a lot of time in their characters, was their anchor, was not a place that they were visiting anymore.

361
00:37:18,322 --> 00:37:20,506
You know, they're literally playing in the afterlife.

362
00:37:23,217 --> 00:37:32,940
Also, the main antagonist, the Jailer, was not a character that we evolved very well in the course of that expansion.

363
00:37:33,681 --> 00:37:37,022
Wasn't understood to our players, we hadn't really introduced him before.

364
00:37:37,482 --> 00:37:46,325
He also had this kind of annoying habit of taking credit for all the things that had ever happened in WoW, and it felt a little bit too contrived.

365
00:37:47,390 --> 00:37:51,651
And then lastly, we diminished some of the key story characters.

366
00:37:51,751 --> 00:38:03,253
Characters that our players had grown to love or hate, but nonetheless expected to see have a powerful presence, we kind of diminished them in Shadowlands.

367
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:06,413
And so from a story standpoint, players are disappointed.

368
00:38:06,793 --> 00:38:12,074
And from a franchise standpoint, it was tough to see some of those important characters reduced.

369
00:38:13,695 --> 00:38:15,035
Next was the gameplay itself.

370
00:38:15,915 --> 00:38:24,178
You know, we had been clinging to the idea that, hey, you know, the way we have done expansions in the past is the way we should do it for Shadowlands.

371
00:38:24,778 --> 00:38:29,099
And one of the things we introduced all the way back in Legion was this notion of borrowed power.

372
00:38:29,599 --> 00:38:44,704
That is, that you get items, in the case of Legion, it was an artifact weapon, that you're leveling up and that you're, you know, you're accumulating points, but the power is in the item and not in your character, the thing that you've invested time in.

373
00:38:45,882 --> 00:38:47,143
and players didn't like it.

374
00:38:59,945 --> 00:39:01,546
We also, I mean, things changed.

375
00:39:01,786 --> 00:39:03,567
Players changed.

376
00:39:03,667 --> 00:39:09,711
During this time, we're bringing a lot of new players, but I think that time is really important to people.

377
00:39:11,412 --> 00:39:18,197
And we couldn't count on them spending as much time grinding their way through something as they had in the past.

378
00:39:18,837 --> 00:39:21,719
And so we were competing with a lot of other entertainment experiences.

379
00:39:21,799 --> 00:39:24,321
So how do we change what we're doing?

380
00:39:25,642 --> 00:39:27,563
The last part, too, is with our community.

381
00:39:28,447 --> 00:39:33,636
We had, again, as I mentioned, we released Shadowlands in COVID.

382
00:39:34,116 --> 00:39:35,358
It was pretty tough for us.

383
00:39:35,859 --> 00:39:37,963
Everyone had to go home and work from home.

384
00:39:37,983 --> 00:39:39,125
We'd never done that before.

385
00:39:39,776 --> 00:39:43,659
And we put all of our resources on getting Shadowlands out.

386
00:39:43,739 --> 00:39:46,260
It was important for us to be able to do that for our players.

387
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:47,541
We made that paramount.

388
00:39:47,621 --> 00:39:53,305
But as a result, we hadn't really adequately resourced the first update for Shadowlands.

389
00:39:53,325 --> 00:39:57,788
So there was kind of a lengthy gap between the release of Shadowlands and the first update.

390
00:39:57,848 --> 00:39:59,629
And players are like, hey, I'm kind of bored.

391
00:39:59,929 --> 00:40:00,750
I want something to do.

392
00:40:00,790 --> 00:40:02,351
What's going on, Blizzard?

393
00:40:03,111 --> 00:40:04,272
Did you run out of steam?

394
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,361
and we weren't consistent in those updates.

395
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:10,763
And we also weren't communicating with our players.

396
00:40:11,323 --> 00:40:17,206
We'd always kind of prided ourselves in, like, we're going to do something amazing and then, you know, surprise you with it and hopefully you're going to love it.

397
00:40:17,306 --> 00:40:20,587
But our players needed to know, no, I'm, you know, I want to know.

398
00:40:20,687 --> 00:40:22,068
I mean, I'm investing time here.

399
00:40:22,088 --> 00:40:24,649
I want to still hang out with my friends who want cool things to do.

400
00:40:24,769 --> 00:40:25,950
What are you up to, you know?

401
00:40:26,370 --> 00:40:28,191
And are you even listening to us anymore?

402
00:40:32,558 --> 00:40:34,340
and here's some of the comments that you can see.

403
00:40:34,360 --> 00:40:44,093
A couple of comments complaining about borrowed power, complaining about the respect for players' time, and that quote was so important to us.

404
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,554
That's become a mantra for us.

405
00:40:46,035 --> 00:40:47,877
Respect your players' time.

406
00:40:50,100 --> 00:40:50,601
So what do we do?

407
00:40:51,485 --> 00:40:59,050
Now we were already, you know, as we were, you know, after we finished off the initial release of Shadowlands, we were talking about where do we go next.

408
00:40:59,430 --> 00:41:06,975
We realized that, you know, maybe this was going to be a little bit too far out for our players and that we wanted to return to high fantasy.

409
00:41:06,995 --> 00:41:08,095
So that was already in the works.

410
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,337
We wanted to go to the Dragon Isles.

411
00:41:10,377 --> 00:41:11,638
We wanted to tell that story.

412
00:41:11,678 --> 00:41:14,900
It's an important aspect of, you know, the history of Azeroth.

413
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:21,802
And so that was already in the works to do Dragonflight, but Dragonflight turned out to be exactly what players wanted in terms of setting.

414
00:41:22,103 --> 00:41:28,805
High fantasy, good to be on dragons, deeper storytelling, you know, for our players.

415
00:41:28,865 --> 00:41:37,809
We worked in, you know, those key story characters and we told you a lot of the threads that we had either kept a little mysterious or we hadn't connected before.

416
00:41:38,840 --> 00:41:41,922
And we reintroduced dangerous, but humor.

417
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,404
It was more lighthearted.

418
00:41:43,464 --> 00:41:47,827
It wasn't as somber as the afterlife that we saw in Shadowlands.

419
00:41:48,748 --> 00:41:54,793
And the zones themselves were vibrant, bright light, and really majestic and beautiful things.

420
00:41:54,833 --> 00:41:59,937
This is actually a shot from a quest in the game, where all you do is stay a while and listen.

421
00:42:00,737 --> 00:42:06,662
You sit down on this ledge, and you look at the dragons flying around, and you have a little dialogue with the character.

422
00:42:09,428 --> 00:42:09,488
and

423
00:42:27,396 --> 00:42:27,676
that we

424
00:42:44,065 --> 00:42:54,888
and our players in terms of where they're playing, how they're spending their time, and looking at that, reviewing it, talking to them, and using that to inform your design decisions.

425
00:42:55,548 --> 00:42:59,049
And I specifically say data-informed.

426
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:04,230
We didn't go so far as to, we're going to look at all the data, and that's the game that we're going to do.

427
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,490
We're going to check all the boxes.

428
00:43:05,610 --> 00:43:08,151
But rather, hey, here's some stuff we want to do.

429
00:43:08,271 --> 00:43:10,151
Here's a whole list of things that we want to do.

430
00:43:10,691 --> 00:43:13,332
What are the things that we think our players are going to like the most?

431
00:43:14,492 --> 00:43:16,133
based on what they're telling us.

432
00:43:16,333 --> 00:43:18,014
And we prioritize those things.

433
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:21,195
And that made a pretty big difference for us.

434
00:43:22,316 --> 00:43:26,337
We also, for those of you who play WoW, at the very beginning, it was two factions.

435
00:43:26,717 --> 00:43:28,518
It was Horde versus Alliance, right?

436
00:43:29,198 --> 00:43:31,680
And that's an important part of the story.

437
00:43:32,380 --> 00:43:39,723
But people, when they first came into the game, they would often choose one faction over the other on the basis of how they looked.

438
00:43:40,143 --> 00:43:41,944
You know, I want to be an orc.

439
00:43:41,984 --> 00:43:42,784
I mean, this is cool.

440
00:43:42,804 --> 00:43:56,190
You know, they ride motorcycles and, you know, they're, you know, they're spiky, you know, or you want to be part of the alliance because actually they look very pretty and they wear, they look awesome in shining armor and their buildings are so cool.

441
00:43:56,250 --> 00:44:01,172
They're like those, you know, yeah, fairy book castles, fairytale castles.

442
00:44:02,305 --> 00:44:10,768
but that decision up front could actually trap you because you meet somebody in real life, you're hanging out at GDC, it's like, oh, you play, wow, that's awesome.

443
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:11,548
What do you play?

444
00:44:11,688 --> 00:44:12,328
I play Alliance.

445
00:44:12,488 --> 00:44:13,189
Oh, I play Horde.

446
00:44:13,249 --> 00:44:14,709
Yeah, well, I guess we can't be friends.

447
00:44:16,169 --> 00:44:18,790
And it's like, well, why should we create that division?

448
00:44:19,190 --> 00:44:23,712
So we broke the cardinal rule and we allow cross-faction play.

449
00:44:27,922 --> 00:44:31,665
Oh, and I can't forget, portrayed here, dragon riding.

450
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:41,170
So flying is something that our players have loved to do and we release an expansion and within minutes it's like, when are we going to get flying?

451
00:44:41,430 --> 00:44:46,593
And we're like, you don't get flying because we want you to walk around on the ground and really get immersed in the story.

452
00:44:46,653 --> 00:44:48,114
And it's a good reason, right?

453
00:44:48,695 --> 00:44:49,535
Experience it more.

454
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,456
But it's like, yeah, but I really want flying.

455
00:44:51,476 --> 00:44:52,397
When are you going to have flying?

456
00:44:53,773 --> 00:44:55,174
So with Dragon Reign, we're like, you know what?

457
00:44:55,715 --> 00:44:57,275
It's an expansion about dragons.

458
00:44:57,796 --> 00:45:00,117
It'd be kind of weird if we don't let people fly.

459
00:45:00,297 --> 00:45:11,184
So we built a whole new flying system, Dragon Riding, that allows you from the very beginning to, you know, you get your dragon and you get to, you know, fly around the entire Dragon Isles.

460
00:45:11,244 --> 00:45:18,508
And we designed all the zones so that they could be taken in from the air and that, you know, and we made a joy of flying.

461
00:45:18,548 --> 00:45:21,190
I don't know if you've tried it, you know, hopefully you agree.

462
00:45:21,770 --> 00:45:27,395
that the aerobatics and the control that you have over your flying mounts is like nothing we've done before.

463
00:45:27,475 --> 00:45:31,038
It's literally like a flight simulator, in a good way, not a bad way.

464
00:45:31,659 --> 00:45:32,800
No controls for your dragon.

465
00:45:37,464 --> 00:45:39,966
So the other thing we did is we committed.

466
00:45:41,167 --> 00:45:44,630
We've never done this before, but, excuse me,

467
00:45:46,163 --> 00:45:46,323
we've

468
00:46:06,011 --> 00:46:07,232
For these patch updates.

469
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:11,978
Now, some of these things were part of what we call the expansion team, especially the blue banners there.

470
00:46:12,498 --> 00:46:15,962
But a lot of the white banner stuff was that live service team.

471
00:46:16,102 --> 00:46:20,287
And it's funny because we've been operating live service since the beginning.

472
00:46:21,341 --> 00:46:25,203
But it's actually kind of the experience that we had with mobile.

473
00:46:25,283 --> 00:46:28,524
We're like, oh, these people are looking at data all the time.

474
00:46:28,764 --> 00:46:31,205
They're constantly worried about what their players are doing.

475
00:46:31,485 --> 00:46:33,306
They're using this to plan their updates.

476
00:46:34,086 --> 00:46:36,187
Maybe there's some good learnings for us there.

477
00:46:36,267 --> 00:46:37,648
And it turned out to be the case.

478
00:46:37,688 --> 00:46:46,912
Some of the same disciplines that your mobile colleagues are going through, your product managers are going through, we kind of had to relearn for the WoW team.

479
00:46:49,978 --> 00:46:50,038
and

480
00:47:08,864 --> 00:47:10,665
to engage this class of community.

481
00:47:10,906 --> 00:47:14,889
And so we did hardcore mode, which was crazy for us.

482
00:47:14,969 --> 00:47:22,234
It turned out to be a lot of fun for content creators, because they could show people trying to level up as far as they could before getting killed off.

483
00:47:23,055 --> 00:47:26,637
But hardcore for us wasn't always just competitive either.

484
00:47:26,657 --> 00:47:31,221
We'd see groups band together and try and survive as long as they could.

485
00:47:31,261 --> 00:47:32,422
But it was a lot of fun.

486
00:47:32,982 --> 00:47:38,731
and then Season of Discovery was a new way to let players re-experience classic, but with a twist.

487
00:47:38,952 --> 00:47:47,946
We made some modifications that players could make modifications to their class and discover, if you would, those powers.

488
00:47:51,082 --> 00:47:57,665
And then finally on Warcraft itself, Modern WoW itself, we've extended this commitment to our players.

489
00:47:57,685 --> 00:48:01,146
We are releasing content every eight weeks in the game.

490
00:48:02,606 --> 00:48:08,089
And if you'll notice there, for those of you, you may have been traveling yesterday, but there's a little pirate flag.

491
00:48:08,149 --> 00:48:11,010
Well, yesterday we announced Plunderstorm.

492
00:48:11,710 --> 00:48:16,332
which is actually a mode for World of Warcraft.

493
00:48:16,912 --> 00:48:21,253
It isn't inside of WoW Modern and it isn't inside of WoW Classic.

494
00:48:21,834 --> 00:48:26,555
What it is, is it's a battle royale version of the game that you can just jump into.

495
00:48:27,155 --> 00:48:29,576
You don't take your existing character from either of those games.

496
00:48:30,356 --> 00:48:31,317
You roll a new character,

497
00:48:32,277 --> 00:48:35,541
If you play battle royale games, you kind of know how that functions.

498
00:48:35,621 --> 00:48:47,013
But when you were killing off your opponents, as they die, they put out a pinata of the loot in the form of the spells that they were using.

499
00:48:47,093 --> 00:48:50,797
So you pick and choose which of their spells you want, and then you carry on.

500
00:48:51,805 --> 00:48:54,806
And we did it kind of for fun.

501
00:48:54,866 --> 00:48:56,846
We just thought this would be a cool mode to put in.

502
00:48:57,367 --> 00:48:58,867
We wanted to see if players would like it.

503
00:48:58,887 --> 00:49:01,008
The response has been really good for us.

504
00:49:01,848 --> 00:49:03,108
I think people are having a lot of fun.

505
00:49:03,168 --> 00:49:04,549
They were totally unexpected.

506
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:16,712
I think what was really interesting for me, I was reading some of the comments yesterday, is that it might surprise you, but there are actually people that will get on the internet and complain about your game.

507
00:49:18,418 --> 00:49:20,319
And yeah, I know, weird, right?

508
00:49:20,679 --> 00:49:22,040
At least it was back in the 90s.

509
00:49:22,100 --> 00:49:22,901
Certainly not today.

510
00:49:22,941 --> 00:49:23,981
It's pretty commonplace.

511
00:49:24,562 --> 00:49:30,045
But there are some people who are like, you know, man, I wish they, you know, why did they make this Battle Royale thing, blah, blah, blah.

512
00:49:30,145 --> 00:49:36,069
And we knew we'd done the right thing when our own players were coming forward and saying, why are you complaining?

513
00:49:36,109 --> 00:49:41,033
They give you something, essentially, that you didn't know was coming.

514
00:49:41,353 --> 00:49:42,634
It's a pleasant surprise.

515
00:49:42,994 --> 00:49:44,515
It seems to be a hell of a lot of fun.

516
00:49:46,196 --> 00:49:47,477
I don't understand why you're complaining.

517
00:49:47,557 --> 00:49:48,417
You people just complain.

518
00:49:48,617 --> 00:49:54,280
I was watching the comments from the players towards the players, and I'm like, OK, we did something right.

519
00:49:54,440 --> 00:49:57,881
And we want to continue to do creative stuff, keep it stirred up.

520
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:06,145
Just really don't get stuck in the rut that we had been in, where we were repeating the same pattern.

521
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:13,689
And then finally, we announced the next three expansions at BlizzCon.

522
00:50:13,889 --> 00:50:15,011
We've never done that.

523
00:50:15,331 --> 00:50:23,258
We committed to what's the story going to be set in, what are the major plot points, or at least the major plot point for each one of these.

524
00:50:24,339 --> 00:50:25,801
And we're committed to delivering on that.

525
00:50:30,892 --> 00:50:43,321
So summing up the things that we feel we did right to turn around what was happening on World of Warcraft in story and setting, gameplay, and community.

526
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:49,026
And these are some of the comments as a result of it.

527
00:50:50,006 --> 00:50:52,148
They're ecstatic that we got rid of Borrowed Power.

528
00:50:52,228 --> 00:50:53,689
They're happy with Dragonflight.

529
00:50:53,729 --> 00:50:54,850
They like the story.

530
00:50:55,390 --> 00:50:57,612
They love the pace of content updates.

531
00:50:58,453 --> 00:51:00,094
And that's the stuff you like to see, right?

532
00:51:03,646 --> 00:51:05,107
So, what was the result?

533
00:51:06,188 --> 00:51:19,899
We actually, for the first time in the history of World of Warcraft, we have more subscribers before the next expansion comes out than at any other time in the life of an expansion, right?

534
00:51:20,140 --> 00:51:26,305
So, normally we would see a drop-off that would continue and then it pops up when the next expansion comes out.

535
00:51:26,345 --> 00:51:28,707
You see that nice big, you know,

536
00:51:29,923 --> 00:51:29,963
in

537
00:51:59,860 --> 00:52:02,801
So I think I've covered some of this, but I want to make sure.

538
00:52:02,921 --> 00:52:09,002
So biggest lessons for us that I wanted to impart to you is that players want evolution.

539
00:52:10,922 --> 00:52:14,103
These communities are deeply invested in the games.

540
00:52:14,223 --> 00:52:15,823
And they don't want to leave your game.

541
00:52:15,903 --> 00:52:17,263
Don't give them a reason to leave.

542
00:52:17,784 --> 00:52:18,804
Give them a reason to stay.

543
00:52:20,444 --> 00:52:24,465
And community sentiment during Shadowlands was a real wake-up call for us.

544
00:52:25,858 --> 00:52:30,342
What our players wanted had fundamentally changed, and we hadn't recognized that.

545
00:52:31,664 --> 00:52:38,510
So we had to throw out our old playbook that had worked for us for 18 years at that point.

546
00:52:39,371 --> 00:52:43,855
And now we're crafting a new playbook, but our players are co-authoring it with us.

547
00:52:49,420 --> 00:52:51,222
I think I pretty much covered it.

548
00:52:52,000 --> 00:53:02,607
So our motto on top of our mission statement, which was original and is true today, is to honor the past and forge the future.

549
00:53:05,389 --> 00:53:06,910
So with that, I want to thank you.

550
00:53:17,318 --> 00:53:20,560
And I think we have, Drew, we have just a couple minutes.

551
00:53:22,257 --> 00:53:26,180
Okay, if anybody wants to ask a question, head up to the mic if you want.

552
00:53:27,401 --> 00:53:29,603
It's right behind you there, if you don't mind.

553
00:53:31,685 --> 00:53:32,425
I'll do my best.

554
00:53:36,409 --> 00:53:36,549
Hi.

555
00:53:36,849 --> 00:53:37,349
How you doing, John?

556
00:53:37,750 --> 00:53:38,070
Good.

557
00:53:38,490 --> 00:53:39,050
Ben Fox.

558
00:53:40,131 --> 00:53:45,173
I was at Blizzard for a little while running some data applications.

559
00:53:45,233 --> 00:53:46,194
And I'm curious.

560
00:53:47,034 --> 00:53:52,777
I saw some of the data information that you provided on how well the game has done over the years.

561
00:53:53,357 --> 00:53:55,678
Where do you see that kind of taking you in the future?

562
00:53:55,738 --> 00:54:01,621
And how big of a part will data play in how you evolve the game and continue to move forward?

563
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:05,463
Data has a significant part of the game right now.

564
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:11,285
We have a very close relationship between our product management team and our dev team.

565
00:54:11,866 --> 00:54:14,247
As I said, we have a dedicated live services team.

566
00:54:14,267 --> 00:54:17,088
We actually have an associate game director, Jeremy Feasel.

567
00:54:17,468 --> 00:54:18,309
That is his life.

568
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:24,392
And if any of you knew the history of Feasel, in Misa Pandaria, we were

569
00:54:26,053 --> 00:54:34,736
we need a little more time, and we're like, hey, Fiesel, go create something for us to keep the players busy, and he went crazy and created the Timeless Isle.

570
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:37,417
So it's in his DNA.

571
00:54:37,457 --> 00:54:44,039
I think he's the right person to lead it, but they work closely with our PM group, and we literally do weekly review of

572
00:54:44,799 --> 00:54:46,019
What are the things we'd like to do?

573
00:54:46,239 --> 00:54:48,100
What are the things our players would like us to do?

574
00:54:48,640 --> 00:55:01,423
And we use a kind of a methodology to stack rank, you know, both the how big an effort is it to do that and, you know, how much excitement do we think our engagement is like how we want to measure things we'll get from our players.

575
00:55:01,903 --> 00:55:11,365
We also have put a lot of effort into variety of activities and not over index on, hey, it's just for the Raiders or the, you know, the Battlegrounds folks, but

576
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:16,898
you know, even for the folks that are there to just kind of role play and go out and be in the world together.

577
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:18,663
We want to make sure we're giving them new content.

578
00:55:19,786 --> 00:55:19,966
Yep.

579
00:55:20,527 --> 00:55:20,828
Anybody else?

580
00:55:20,908 --> 00:55:21,049
Yeah.

581
00:55:21,955 --> 00:55:22,215
Hi.

582
00:55:22,856 --> 00:55:23,516
I just have a question.

583
00:55:23,536 --> 00:55:29,039
I think your talk was great, but how do you engage new players that are coming to Alford for the first time?

584
00:55:29,479 --> 00:55:32,580
They can feel left out with so many expansions, so many stuff to do.

585
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:35,962
They can feel left out because they're just coming to the game after 20 years.

586
00:55:36,402 --> 00:55:38,123
How do you cater to those gamers?

587
00:55:38,503 --> 00:55:39,264
Yeah, good question.

588
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:45,127
And, you know, this is an area that we have to continue to evolve, but what we introduced is

589
00:55:46,204 --> 00:55:51,328
When you first come in, if you start from the very beginning, you go to a special place called Exiles Reach.

590
00:55:51,528 --> 00:55:53,089
Don't be thwarted by that terrible name.

591
00:55:54,070 --> 00:55:56,532
But you actually are there with other new players.

592
00:55:56,692 --> 00:55:59,154
And you level to 10, essentially.

593
00:55:59,734 --> 00:56:02,056
And you get to know the ropes of how to play the game.

594
00:56:02,096 --> 00:56:04,498
And we kind of walk you through all the mechanics of it.

595
00:56:05,039 --> 00:56:11,463
And from that point, once the next expansion is out, you'll go into Dragonflight.

596
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:13,185
And you'll level up to maximum.

597
00:56:13,485 --> 00:56:13,705
there.

598
00:56:14,186 --> 00:56:20,673
And hopefully, you know, we try to keep that group of people together, so we'll even suggest a realm that you can go to that that group will be in.

599
00:56:21,885 --> 00:56:23,125
But a lot of people don't enter that way.

600
00:56:23,145 --> 00:56:28,867
And most people, or not most people, but a lot of people, their friends will say, hey, come and play WoW with me.

601
00:56:29,547 --> 00:56:31,047
And so we offer a boost to them.

602
00:56:31,828 --> 00:56:33,988
And in that case, they go right into max level.

603
00:56:34,048 --> 00:56:35,789
And they can play right along with their friends.

604
00:56:36,369 --> 00:56:40,150
But as you pointed out, WoW's got a lot of complexity and depth to it.

605
00:56:40,650 --> 00:56:45,431
And so we encourage friends to play together and show them the cool stuff to do.

606
00:56:45,591 --> 00:56:49,532
And here's the do's and don'ts of how to down this boss.

607
00:56:50,432 --> 00:56:50,692
Thank you.

608
00:56:50,712 --> 00:56:50,853
Thanks.

Hi, so when we have a university that's 30 years old, there is a difficulty when it comes to keeping consistent and delivering on the continuity of story, especially when you have other mediums like books, comics, et cetera.

610
00:57:29,654 --> 00:57:36,856
Are there any lessons or any interesting challenges that you've had to overcome to get to the point that you are today?

611
00:57:36,876 --> 00:57:40,817
Yeah, I mean, most of the, so the question was related

612
00:57:41,382 --> 00:57:46,787
creating cohesion and consistency across our stories in various forms of media.

613
00:57:47,668 --> 00:57:50,971
So one of the things we do is that we review all of it.

614
00:57:51,432 --> 00:57:55,676
So read the books, read the comic books, look at the board games.

615
00:57:57,197 --> 00:58:02,983
you know, reviewed the movie, you know, and you know, that's honestly a big part of Chris Metzen's job now.

616
00:58:03,103 --> 00:58:07,126
He's returned to work with us because it's so important, right?

617
00:58:07,146 --> 00:58:12,411
You want characters to be true to their, you know, their nature, you know, and their motivations.

618
00:58:13,712 --> 00:58:19,976
and we'll continue to explore other forms of media because that's a great way for people to get to know the universe.

619
00:58:20,576 --> 00:58:21,597
We're excited about it.

620
00:58:21,737 --> 00:58:31,042
We think there's a lot of great parables and lessons in WoW and the way the denizens of Azeroth behave and treat each other.

621
00:58:32,583 --> 00:58:34,084
But we do monitor all that.

622
00:58:34,124 --> 00:58:39,007
We don't just throw it out there and let anybody do what they want with the universe.

623
00:58:39,527 --> 00:58:42,029
But that being said, as you point out, it's 30 years.

624
00:58:42,950 --> 00:58:44,951
Time and time we even have our own inconsistencies.

625
00:58:46,092 --> 00:58:53,577
We've established databases to be able to go back and track, okay, what exactly did Kegar say and what was Medivh's thing?

626
00:58:53,957 --> 00:58:55,659
Thank you so much.

627
00:58:56,059 --> 00:58:56,259
Thanks.

628
00:59:07,380 --> 00:59:09,943
First of all, thank you for the presentation and these amazing games.

629
00:59:10,023 --> 00:59:10,683
I'm a big fan.

630
00:59:11,124 --> 00:59:16,689
I just wanted to ask, maybe, what was the role of intellectual property in building your franchise?

631
00:59:16,849 --> 00:59:20,312
Maybe you can share some priorities or challenges in these terms.

632
00:59:21,017 --> 00:59:21,457
Yeah, it's funny.

633
00:59:21,777 --> 00:59:25,219
We didn't set out to build a universe that would last 30 years.

634
00:59:25,879 --> 00:59:31,041
But that's why I wanted to show some of the decisions we made along the way that worked out really well towards it.

635
00:59:32,001 --> 00:59:34,602
A couple of years ago, we reorganized.

636
00:59:34,802 --> 00:59:36,683
And that's how I became general manager.

637
00:59:36,763 --> 00:59:44,025
And that's a big part of my job is to safeguard Warcraft as an intellectual property.

638
00:59:44,786 --> 00:59:45,506
But I'm a developer.

639
00:59:45,886 --> 00:59:47,727
And so I think of that through the games that we make.

640
00:59:48,907 --> 00:59:51,669
We will always be central in games.

641
00:59:52,489 --> 00:59:55,310
If you look at something like Marvel, they were central in comic books.

642
00:59:55,431 --> 00:59:56,951
New characters were created there.

643
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,313
Story was created there.

644
00:59:59,473 --> 01:00:02,774
And the movies and the games were an offshoot of that.

645
01:00:02,835 --> 01:00:04,736
And I think for us, it's the games.

646
01:00:04,776 --> 01:00:06,957
We'll express the story first through the games.

647
01:00:07,597 --> 01:00:14,221
And then we'll look for cool and new things to do and find different ways for you to experience Warcraft in other media.

648
01:00:14,941 --> 01:00:17,122
But games will be the center for that.

649
01:00:18,263 --> 01:00:18,583
Thank you.

650
01:00:20,181 --> 01:00:20,667
Thank you all.

651
01:00:20,748 --> 01:00:21,436
Thank you so much.
