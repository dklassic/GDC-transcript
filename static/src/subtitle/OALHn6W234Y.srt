1
00:00:05,907 --> 00:00:06,867
Good afternoon, everyone.

2
00:00:06,867 --> 00:00:09,028
Thank you very, very much for coming to,

3
00:00:09,028 --> 00:00:12,988
which is essentially the last session of the conference,

4
00:00:12,988 --> 00:00:14,849
sort of time schedule-wise.

5
00:00:14,849 --> 00:00:19,030
I'm sure a lot of us are excited but exhausted

6
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:20,930
and a little bit low on energy.

7
00:00:20,930 --> 00:00:24,511
I actually did a talk in this very room on Tuesday

8
00:00:24,511 --> 00:00:26,831
as part of the boot camp, and I was full of energy,

9
00:00:26,831 --> 00:00:29,151
and it was a high-energy, exciting little session.

10
00:00:29,151 --> 00:00:31,972
This one's going to be a little bit more low-key,

11
00:00:31,972 --> 00:00:33,132
I think, for all of our sakes.

12
00:00:36,356 --> 00:00:40,069
So, the...

13
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:43,992
Postmortems are actually a fairly common and popular thing

14
00:00:43,992 --> 00:00:47,293
as part of GDC, because one of the best ways that we can learn

15
00:00:47,293 --> 00:00:50,375
is to go back to the things we've done before,

16
00:00:50,375 --> 00:00:52,836
analyze them to a point, but sort of consider

17
00:00:52,836 --> 00:00:54,697
certain aspects of them.

18
00:00:54,697 --> 00:00:57,038
In this particular case, what I've done is,

19
00:00:57,038 --> 00:00:59,239
it's going to be a bit of a very fast session,

20
00:00:59,239 --> 00:01:02,820
because this is only a half-hour session.

21
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:05,822
I'm going to go through three VR projects that

22
00:01:05,822 --> 00:01:07,503
are very different.

23
00:01:07,503 --> 00:01:09,744
And I think if there's any takeaway I want to have today,

24
00:01:09,744 --> 00:01:10,344
it's that.

25
00:01:11,527 --> 00:01:15,229
One of the problems we're sort of getting at the moment is everybody going, oh yeah,

26
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,629
VR.

27
00:01:16,629 --> 00:01:19,311
And we just, VR, dump it in a bucket, that's what it is.

28
00:01:19,311 --> 00:01:19,511
It's not.

29
00:01:19,511 --> 00:01:27,856
There are so many different things that VR is already, and I'm still very much of the

30
00:01:27,856 --> 00:01:35,040
belief that none of us yet really have any scope of where VR is going to end up, because

31
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,322
I don't think anybody yet has worked out the exact best language.

32
00:01:40,303 --> 00:01:42,344
to use to present VR.

33
00:01:42,344 --> 00:01:45,145
We're having to relearn cinematography.

34
00:01:45,145 --> 00:01:48,347
We're really having to relearn how we approach the audio of it.

35
00:01:48,347 --> 00:01:52,769
I've looked at a lot of VR projects recently,

36
00:01:52,769 --> 00:01:54,850
and I don't want to be nasty about it,

37
00:01:54,850 --> 00:01:58,012
but the audio in a lot of these is frankly really very ordinary.

38
00:01:58,572 --> 00:02:05,694
They're not doing a very good job of conveying the sense of presence of being in a place.

39
00:02:05,694 --> 00:02:13,616
We can't use just common stereo or mono, and even HRTF, which is the sort of new spatial

40
00:02:13,616 --> 00:02:16,476
format, is not a magic bullet.

41
00:02:16,476 --> 00:02:21,597
HRTF is just another thing, and in one of the ones I'll talk about today I'll go into

42
00:02:21,597 --> 00:02:23,018
that in a little bit more detail.

43
00:02:25,498 --> 00:02:28,274
So this is called immerse, impact and inform.

44
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:36,453
And the reason why is because if we think of it in a triangle and we've got those three

45
00:02:36,453 --> 00:02:42,017
elements in a triangle, you will tend with your projects to sort of lean a little bit

46
00:02:42,017 --> 00:02:45,160
more towards one than the other two.

47
00:02:45,160 --> 00:02:49,223
Or you might, if you're dead set, you might equally have all three elements to a certain

48
00:02:49,223 --> 00:02:49,403
degree.

49
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:55,869
These are the three projects I'm going to be talking about and each one focuses on one

50
00:02:55,869 --> 00:02:56,989
of those specific.

51
00:02:58,187 --> 00:03:00,348
elements at the reduction of the other ones.

52
00:03:00,348 --> 00:03:02,648
So we have VR Regatta, which was on the Vive, Oculus Gear VR.

53
00:03:02,648 --> 00:03:04,489
Outbreak Origins is a location-based one.

54
00:03:04,489 --> 00:03:09,170
You've all seen these sort of ideas of people running around in a warehouse.

55
00:03:09,170 --> 00:03:14,532
They've got a backpack on with a computer, their VR headsets, their headphones, and they're

56
00:03:14,532 --> 00:03:15,412
carrying a plastic gun.

57
00:03:15,412 --> 00:03:21,213
Then there was actually a military training simulator that I worked on for the Australian

58
00:03:21,213 --> 00:03:21,593
Army.

59
00:03:22,645 --> 00:03:26,886
It's basically the same sort of technology as Outbreak Origins in that they can move

60
00:03:26,886 --> 00:03:30,647
freely around a training area with the equipment on it, but obviously a military training simulator

61
00:03:30,647 --> 00:03:38,148
has a very, very different purpose than anything that's sort of a game-based idea.

62
00:03:38,148 --> 00:03:40,909
So as I said, VR is not a single thing.

63
00:03:40,909 --> 00:03:48,350
So VR audio must respond to the specific needs of the project in the same way that we treat

64
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:48,630
it.

65
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,404
The audio that we would do for a film, we would treat differently to the audio that

66
00:03:53,404 --> 00:03:55,746
we would do for a television series or a Netflix series.

67
00:03:55,746 --> 00:03:59,710
And then we would treat game audio differently again, or a podcast.

68
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:04,575
So just saying it's audio for media is a very broad term and we have to approach each of

69
00:04:04,575 --> 00:04:06,436
these things differently.

70
00:04:07,362 --> 00:04:10,665
In VR, I think it's possibly the same way that you might say

71
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:13,408
that, well, the audio that I would do for an FPS

72
00:04:13,408 --> 00:04:14,669
is going to be different to the audio

73
00:04:14,669 --> 00:04:16,932
that I would do for a strategy game.

74
00:04:16,932 --> 00:04:18,413
We have to accept that that's the same for VR,

75
00:04:18,413 --> 00:04:19,894
depending on what the purpose is.

76
00:04:19,894 --> 00:04:23,178
And yet, again, the reason why I've done this whole talk

77
00:04:23,178 --> 00:04:25,100
is because I've observed that some people

78
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:31,746
are not quite understanding the possibility of this yet.

79
00:04:31,746 --> 00:04:32,247
So, VR regatta.

80
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:36,522
is one where the immersion is the critical aspect

81
00:04:36,522 --> 00:04:37,803
of the project.

82
00:04:37,803 --> 00:04:40,205
Outbreak Origins, it was the impact.

83
00:04:40,205 --> 00:04:41,745
And the military training simulator

84
00:04:41,745 --> 00:04:44,887
is purely about informing the personnel

85
00:04:44,887 --> 00:04:47,669
who are training with this.

86
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:49,590
And so each of them will have, I mean,

87
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:52,132
obviously you've got to inform somebody.

88
00:04:52,132 --> 00:04:54,213
So in the VR regatta game and in the Outbreak Origins,

89
00:04:54,213 --> 00:04:56,535
there's still some level of informing

90
00:04:56,535 --> 00:04:58,216
the audience or the player what's going on.

91
00:04:58,216 --> 00:05:00,957
But it's probably much lower down the list

92
00:05:00,957 --> 00:05:02,638
than it was in the military training simulator.

93
00:05:05,090 --> 00:05:11,258
So, VR Regatta was a lot of fun to work on because it was a fixed position.

94
00:05:11,258 --> 00:05:12,679
You were sitting in a boat.

95
00:05:13,653 --> 00:05:15,855
You weren't walking around, you couldn't get out of the boat,

96
00:05:15,855 --> 00:05:17,195
you could move around the boat a little bit,

97
00:05:17,195 --> 00:05:18,816
but this actually allowed for a really,

98
00:05:18,816 --> 00:05:21,537
really curatable experience.

99
00:05:21,537 --> 00:05:23,498
I knew that you were always in a boat,

100
00:05:23,498 --> 00:05:25,119
so you were always surrounded by water,

101
00:05:25,119 --> 00:05:26,700
which means I could place the water,

102
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,001
and I could really work on tuning the water

103
00:05:29,001 --> 00:05:30,942
and making it really lush and lovely.

104
00:05:30,942 --> 00:05:33,223
Same with the wind, and the wind was very important

105
00:05:33,223 --> 00:05:34,544
because sailing boat.

106
00:05:34,544 --> 00:05:40,566
So that limited scope of in a boat, on a water,

107
00:05:41,857 --> 00:05:45,520
meant that I could polish the elements that I did have

108
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:49,224
far more than if I'd had to make 50 different levels with 5,000 monsters and

109
00:05:49,224 --> 00:05:51,106
20 different weapons and all this sort of stuff

110
00:05:51,106 --> 00:05:54,649
where you've got, you're just spending all your time putting content in, I had the

111
00:05:54,649 --> 00:05:56,491
luxury of really being able to

112
00:05:56,491 --> 00:05:57,452
polish this quite highly.

113
00:05:58,253 --> 00:06:00,855
Now, it was a small scope.

114
00:06:00,855 --> 00:06:03,798
I mean, this was a very small team,

115
00:06:03,798 --> 00:06:07,361
an indie developer in Australia, and a small team.

116
00:06:07,361 --> 00:06:09,663
They didn't have a lot of time.

117
00:06:09,663 --> 00:06:11,844
They didn't have a lot of budget.

118
00:06:11,844 --> 00:06:14,266
But again, that meant that because it wasn't...

119
00:06:14,587 --> 00:06:16,007
One of the things about a lot of simulators,

120
00:06:16,007 --> 00:06:18,009
like if you've got spaceship simulators

121
00:06:18,009 --> 00:06:20,450
and airplane simulators, often there's not a lot of,

122
00:06:20,450 --> 00:06:22,891
you're not rendering lots of trees and stuff like that

123
00:06:22,891 --> 00:06:24,432
because you're up in the air.

124
00:06:24,432 --> 00:06:27,494
Same sort of thing with this, you're in the water.

125
00:06:27,494 --> 00:06:27,934
So there's no AI.

126
00:06:27,934 --> 00:06:31,296
So there was not a huge demand on resources

127
00:06:31,296 --> 00:06:32,897
for the rest of things going on,

128
00:06:32,897 --> 00:06:34,758
and not a huge demand on the audio system

129
00:06:34,758 --> 00:06:38,540
from the point of view of not lots of environmental sounds

130
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,601
and monsters and AI.

131
00:06:41,202 --> 00:06:44,490
So I could put everything into the few things that mattered.

132
00:06:45,325 --> 00:06:48,187
Now, you might be thinking, well, that doesn't work.

133
00:06:48,187 --> 00:06:49,668
Like, I want really good wind in my game,

134
00:06:49,668 --> 00:06:51,549
but I've got lots of things to go to deal with.

135
00:06:51,549 --> 00:06:53,691
That's still possible.

136
00:06:53,691 --> 00:06:56,093
You then just need to set up how priorities work,

137
00:06:56,093 --> 00:06:58,755
or you can extrapolate some of the things.

138
00:06:58,755 --> 00:06:59,776
I mean, as you can see there,

139
00:06:59,776 --> 00:07:01,557
it's like 24 channels, which I've used for the wind.

140
00:07:01,557 --> 00:07:03,739
Well, you could probably get similar effects

141
00:07:03,739 --> 00:07:06,180
by starting with that and then cutting down

142
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:09,403
and working a balance between your resource needs

143
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:11,204
and what sort of sound you want.

144
00:07:11,204 --> 00:07:12,545
But again, you can also achieve this

145
00:07:12,545 --> 00:07:14,547
by using a priority system where it's like,

146
00:07:15,267 --> 00:07:20,429
Yeah, so I'm using this many channels when there's not much going on, but when monsters

147
00:07:20,429 --> 00:07:24,971
start coming in or whatever, I can start to reduce the use of some of these to allow these

148
00:07:24,971 --> 00:07:25,611
things to come in.

149
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:29,072
So those of you who are not used to working with audio systems, there are lots of ways

150
00:07:29,072 --> 00:07:35,355
in which you can balance out the need to juggle needing lots of channels and only having a

151
00:07:35,355 --> 00:07:37,095
finite number of channels to work with.

152
00:07:40,152 --> 00:07:42,713
All right, so I'm going to go through this bit

153
00:07:42,713 --> 00:07:44,114
in a fair bit of detail.

154
00:07:44,114 --> 00:07:46,956
So you can see there a representation

155
00:07:46,956 --> 00:07:49,237
from above of the boat.

156
00:07:49,237 --> 00:07:52,079
And the camera would normally be sitting in a boat,

157
00:07:52,079 --> 00:07:53,720
but I moved it across just for clarity.

158
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,282
So the camera there is the standard camera

159
00:07:56,282 --> 00:07:57,863
you'd have in Unity.

160
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,244
And what I did was I created an array.

161
00:07:59,244 --> 00:08:01,605
So where that says ambient array, that is actually

162
00:08:01,605 --> 00:08:03,226
a series of.

163
00:08:03,567 --> 00:08:08,551
sound emitters placed around the camera, kind of north, south, east, west, and each one

164
00:08:08,551 --> 00:08:12,354
of those would basically play a looping wind sound.

165
00:08:12,354 --> 00:08:14,416
Why did I do that?

166
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:22,502
One of the key things with VR is the ability to turn your head within the environment.

167
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:26,806
Every one of us right now are literally sitting within a sphere.

168
00:08:28,037 --> 00:08:32,464
of the world, like we have air all around here and that air is basically what translates

169
00:08:32,464 --> 00:08:35,609
the sound into our ear and it doesn't just come in from here and here, it comes in from

170
00:08:35,609 --> 00:08:38,013
all directions, bounces off our ears, etc.

171
00:08:38,013 --> 00:08:38,514
And so

172
00:08:39,576 --> 00:08:43,558
What I was trying to do was sort of create in some ways a little bit of that bubble.

173
00:08:43,558 --> 00:08:50,201
And so by having wind coming out of each of these and each of those wind sounds is just

174
00:08:50,201 --> 00:08:55,004
slightly different, it achieved what is in my mind one of the most important things to

175
00:08:55,004 --> 00:08:58,166
achieve with audio for VR, a point of difference.

176
00:08:58,846 --> 00:09:03,308
When I turn my head, I feel like there's something there and something there and something there.

177
00:09:03,308 --> 00:09:05,990
I feel like I'm turning my head within a bubble of sound.

178
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:09,232
Whereas with stereo, you've got this here and this here, but if I turn my head, it's

179
00:09:09,232 --> 00:09:11,833
like, well, what's there and what's there?

180
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:16,556
And then these other ones are the fixed ambiences, which are placed out, actually end up working

181
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,457
essentially like an audio parallax layer.

182
00:09:19,797 --> 00:09:22,659
So I've got my array here, and then kind of in the gaps,

183
00:09:22,659 --> 00:09:24,621
but at further distance back,

184
00:09:24,621 --> 00:09:26,102
and all of these have got attenuation on them,

185
00:09:26,102 --> 00:09:27,603
so they're all sort of dropping off.

186
00:09:27,603 --> 00:09:31,786
Those ones at the back just sort of sound like wind over there.

187
00:09:31,786 --> 00:09:33,788
And so when you turn your head, you've got this really nice

188
00:09:33,788 --> 00:09:37,130
sort of, you know, dome of wind around you.

189
00:09:37,130 --> 00:09:38,891
I actually also, the array also had one above as well.

190
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:41,433
So if you did that, there would be wind above you.

191
00:09:41,433 --> 00:09:43,895
And you could do as many of these as you wanted to.

192
00:09:43,895 --> 00:09:45,737
This is the balance that I worked with,

193
00:09:45,737 --> 00:09:46,937
and I really liked how, the result.

194
00:09:47,618 --> 00:09:51,739
I then have a mono emitter over here, which is a 3D emitter, and that is actually the

195
00:09:51,739 --> 00:09:52,680
source wind.

196
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:56,621
So that will actually, all these other ones are just a really gentle atmos, like almost

197
00:09:56,621 --> 00:09:57,342
like a room tone.

198
00:09:57,342 --> 00:09:59,782
Super, super subtle and soft.

199
00:09:59,782 --> 00:10:00,243
Right?

200
00:10:00,243 --> 00:10:05,285
They're just there to make you feel like the air is there, like the sort of sound you would

201
00:10:05,285 --> 00:10:06,625
have in a completely empty room.

202
00:10:06,625 --> 00:10:08,406
It's subtle, but it's noticeable.

203
00:10:08,406 --> 00:10:11,487
Whereas the mono 3D emitter that was over there, it would always be...

204
00:10:12,553 --> 00:10:15,635
sort of 20 metres away from the boat, wherever the wind was blowing.

205
00:10:15,635 --> 00:10:19,237
So if the wind changed to over there, it would be over there, and it literally just was,

206
00:10:19,237 --> 00:10:23,260
it was the sound of the wind, but you'd be like, oh, the wind's coming from over there.

207
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:26,942
Then I did something else.

208
00:10:26,942 --> 00:10:31,305
I played around with it a lot, and I was like, okay, so, but I know that in real life, when

209
00:10:31,305 --> 00:10:36,569
the wind's blowing, when I turn my head 90 degrees into the wind, the wind blows directly

210
00:10:36,569 --> 00:10:37,309
into my ear canal.

211
00:10:38,163 --> 00:10:40,085
and it actually reduces.

212
00:10:40,085 --> 00:10:43,829
So I actually put in a parameter so that when you turn 90 degrees into the direction of

213
00:10:43,829 --> 00:10:47,693
the wind, the volume of the wind would drop a little bit and it would filter a little

214
00:10:47,693 --> 00:10:48,394
bit.

215
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,596
And I thought, yep, this is getting closer.

216
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:54,641
But then I was like, yeah, but there's that thing of when you look directly into the wind,

217
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:59,646
it's blowing past your ears and you get this really blustery effect over your ears.

218
00:10:59,646 --> 00:11:00,447
Now, that's a problem.

219
00:11:01,533 --> 00:11:08,335
for HRTF because HRTF is quite good at giving us a spatial sort of elements all around us

220
00:11:08,335 --> 00:11:09,115
up to about a metre.

221
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:14,356
Once you get inside a metre in the near field, HRTF just goes bleh, I don't know what to

222
00:11:14,356 --> 00:11:15,157
do.

223
00:11:15,157 --> 00:11:18,837
And I was struggling, I'm thinking how can I get this effect and I started listening

224
00:11:18,837 --> 00:11:22,878
to some sounds and then I found a really, really nice stereo recording of wind blowing

225
00:11:22,878 --> 00:11:23,518
past my ear.

226
00:11:23,518 --> 00:11:27,579
It literally has that, you know, you can feel it rustling around your ear, the shell of

227
00:11:27,579 --> 00:11:28,660
your ear.

228
00:11:28,660 --> 00:11:28,840
I'm like...

229
00:11:30,073 --> 00:11:33,756
you know, that's a stereo sound, you can't use stereo sounds in VR because it'll track

230
00:11:33,756 --> 00:11:35,537
with the head and etc.

231
00:11:35,537 --> 00:11:39,819
And then I thought, except, I added it in.

232
00:11:39,819 --> 00:11:42,180
And it does play, it's a stereo sound, it's right past your ears.

233
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:46,203
But it is playing at zero volume.

234
00:11:47,198 --> 00:11:54,563
anywhere around the 360 degree arc, except for when you get within three degrees of that's

235
00:11:54,563 --> 00:12:00,666
where the wind direction is, it starts to fade up to full volume, it's full volume relatively.

236
00:12:00,666 --> 00:12:03,748
So when you're looking directly down to where the wind is, you get this nice near field

237
00:12:03,748 --> 00:12:07,731
blowing effect past your ears, and as soon as you go three degrees off in either direction

238
00:12:07,731 --> 00:12:08,891
it's faded down to nothing.

239
00:12:08,891 --> 00:12:14,775
So a stereo sound that's locked to my head is working because it's only triggered at

240
00:12:14,775 --> 00:12:15,615
the exact right time.

241
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:19,051
Binaural sounds is another one that would be really good.

242
00:12:19,051 --> 00:12:22,374
Binaural are really good for that whole creepy thing really close

243
00:12:22,374 --> 00:12:24,096
to the back of you, but of course,

244
00:12:24,096 --> 00:12:26,117
binaural if I turn my head doesn't work.

245
00:12:26,117 --> 00:12:27,719
But if binaural is a really short thing,

246
00:12:27,719 --> 00:12:29,320
like think we're playing a horror game,

247
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,562
and it's a little girl's voice that says, hello.

248
00:12:32,558 --> 00:12:35,281
By the time you've heard it and reacted, it's stopped.

249
00:12:35,281 --> 00:12:36,782
So I can turn my head and it doesn't matter.

250
00:12:36,782 --> 00:12:39,304
And so the whole time, there's this little voice on my

251
00:12:39,304 --> 00:12:41,305
shoulder behind my head giving that creepy feeling.

252
00:12:41,305 --> 00:12:44,407
But as long as they're really short, really, really short

253
00:12:44,407 --> 00:12:46,329
things that by the time I've reacted, they've stopped

254
00:12:46,329 --> 00:12:48,711
playing, so I'm not going to notice them sort of swinging

255
00:12:48,711 --> 00:12:51,473
around with me, binaural can be super, super effective.

256
00:12:51,473 --> 00:12:54,195
Because binaural recordings are really good for that new

257
00:12:54,195 --> 00:12:54,635
field thing.

258
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:56,416
So you can see here that there's a whole

259
00:12:56,416 --> 00:12:57,918
bunch of layers there.

260
00:12:57,918 --> 00:13:00,219
And the thing that is really important here.

261
00:13:01,206 --> 00:13:03,789
is HRTF is not a silver bullet.

262
00:13:03,789 --> 00:13:07,994
HRTF is one of many layers that you use

263
00:13:07,994 --> 00:13:11,859
to create the effect of what you want with spatial audio.

264
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:16,225
So the fixed ambiences and the ambient array

265
00:13:16,225 --> 00:13:18,007
were sort of basically HRTF.

266
00:13:18,027 --> 00:13:21,790
The stereo one I was telling you about with the wind is just a stock standard stereo sound.

267
00:13:21,790 --> 00:13:24,933
The mono emitter was a mono 3D sound.

268
00:13:24,933 --> 00:13:28,255
In other areas I think I used just a mono sort of drone sound.

269
00:13:28,255 --> 00:13:35,401
So layering mono, stereo, binaural, 3D, standard 3D sounds with HRTF is how you get this.

270
00:13:35,401 --> 00:13:40,805
Any of you working on VR, any of you who have audio people working for you on VR.

271
00:13:42,694 --> 00:13:46,556
really understand that just switching on HRTF is not enough.

272
00:13:46,556 --> 00:13:51,059
And I've seen some projects where they have just done the normal 3D stuff,

273
00:13:51,059 --> 00:13:53,220
switched on HRTF and gone great.

274
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:56,822
And I'm fairly convinced now that with this,

275
00:13:56,822 --> 00:13:59,783
I reckon even if I turned off the HRTF aspect of it,

276
00:13:59,783 --> 00:14:03,705
all these other layers would mean it would probably still sound better

277
00:14:03,705 --> 00:14:06,627
than just doing the 3D sounds with HRTF.

278
00:14:06,627 --> 00:14:07,447
So just be aware of that.

279
00:14:11,142 --> 00:14:13,183
All right, so I've got a lot to get through.

280
00:14:13,183 --> 00:14:14,624
So with the water, same sort of thing.

281
00:14:14,624 --> 00:14:18,226
We had emitters for the water all around the boat.

282
00:14:18,226 --> 00:14:20,848
Then we had a bow splash when the boat started to move.

283
00:14:20,848 --> 00:14:22,589
The actual sounds would change.

284
00:14:22,589 --> 00:14:26,010
They would be manipulated as we increased in speed to make it

285
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:26,871
sound like more of a whoosh.

286
00:14:26,871 --> 00:14:28,732
And they would actually sometimes crossfade to another

287
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:30,893
sound of more water movement.

288
00:14:30,893 --> 00:14:31,373
Right.

289
00:14:31,914 --> 00:14:33,777
side emitters for port and starboard.

290
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,901
But I had multiple sounds,

291
00:14:35,901 --> 00:14:41,029
and what I did with the side emitters was I had something to get an increase in resolution.

292
00:14:41,029 --> 00:14:44,354
Because this game was on the Vive, you know, you're sitting there,

293
00:14:44,354 --> 00:14:46,598
you can actually lean your body down to the water.

294
00:14:46,778 --> 00:14:48,719
And when you did that and got close to the water,

295
00:14:48,719 --> 00:14:51,181
it wasn't just that I ramped up the volume,

296
00:14:51,181 --> 00:14:53,223
or the volume ramping up automatically

297
00:14:53,223 --> 00:14:54,464
through attenuation.

298
00:14:54,464 --> 00:14:56,225
I actually cross-faded in.

299
00:14:56,225 --> 00:14:58,907
So you've got your normal just white noise, whoosh and whoosh.

300
00:14:58,907 --> 00:15:00,608
But when you put your ear right down,

301
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:04,191
I would raise up like literally a bubbling, sort

302
00:15:04,191 --> 00:15:06,673
of gluggling water sound, because you

303
00:15:06,673 --> 00:15:08,615
could hear the water going along the side of the boat

304
00:15:08,615 --> 00:15:09,575
and the turbulence there.

305
00:15:09,715 --> 00:15:14,925
And so again with VR, in VR I can put my head really, really close to something that I might

306
00:15:14,925 --> 00:15:16,768
not be able to do in a normal game.

307
00:15:16,768 --> 00:15:21,456
And so having all of those different levels of intensity, etc., really, really brought

308
00:15:21,456 --> 00:15:22,558
this project to life.

309
00:15:24,585 --> 00:15:26,106
So, the narrative.

310
00:15:26,106 --> 00:15:28,548
It's basically just the audience's experience.

311
00:15:28,548 --> 00:15:30,869
There wasn't a lot of narrative for me to work with.

312
00:15:30,869 --> 00:15:33,811
Audio supports that narrative by surrounding the audience

313
00:15:33,811 --> 00:15:34,932
in the sonic elements.

314
00:15:34,932 --> 00:15:37,513
There were people who were giving feedback,

315
00:15:37,513 --> 00:15:39,134
saying this is glorious.

316
00:15:39,134 --> 00:15:40,755
I feel like I'm out on a boat.

317
00:15:40,755 --> 00:15:42,876
And people talking about the idea of setting up a fan

318
00:15:42,876 --> 00:15:45,378
so they've got wind blowing into their face to enhance it.

319
00:15:45,718 --> 00:15:49,539
But a lot of people really, really loved that they felt like they were outside.

320
00:15:49,539 --> 00:15:51,099
They felt like they were in the open air.

321
00:15:51,099 --> 00:15:54,720
They really, really loved responding to the wind and actually being able to tell which

322
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:57,761
direction the wind was going in just by turning their head and listening.

323
00:15:57,761 --> 00:16:04,183
Dynamic nature of the wind and water sounds are less about the mechanics of a racing boat

324
00:16:04,183 --> 00:16:06,483
and more about the interplay between the audience and their environment.

325
00:16:06,483 --> 00:16:07,684
And that's the point.

326
00:16:07,684 --> 00:16:10,184
It's not feedback of the boats going fast.

327
00:16:10,184 --> 00:16:13,545
It's feedback of you are in this virtual world.

328
00:16:14,853 --> 00:16:20,814
I'm trying to convince you that you're in a believable world by basically giving you

329
00:16:20,814 --> 00:16:25,756
elements that really, really enhance that immersion.

330
00:16:25,756 --> 00:16:29,817
By immersing the audience in a virtual world, they can believe in all the other elements

331
00:16:29,817 --> 00:16:32,057
of the experience and become more convincing.

332
00:16:32,057 --> 00:16:32,778
And this is the point.

333
00:16:32,778 --> 00:16:39,799
If you get the audio right, it will provide so much support for the other elements of

334
00:16:39,799 --> 00:16:40,940
being in a virtual world.

335
00:16:42,218 --> 00:16:45,465
Doesn't matter if you've got the best graphics in the world,

336
00:16:45,465 --> 00:16:47,650
if your audio is not up to scratch for VR,

337
00:16:47,650 --> 00:16:50,256
it will undermine the entire audience experience.

338
00:16:53,773 --> 00:16:55,234
Alright, Outbreak Origins.

339
00:16:55,234 --> 00:16:56,735
True freedom of movement.

340
00:16:56,735 --> 00:16:59,017
Literally, you can run around a warehouse.

341
00:16:59,017 --> 00:17:00,739
Very linear experience, room by room.

342
00:17:00,739 --> 00:17:05,463
They literally move on from room to room because in a warehouse they've got like 15 minutes

343
00:17:05,463 --> 00:17:05,963
to do it.

344
00:17:05,963 --> 00:17:07,845
It is linear, it is timed, etc.

345
00:17:07,845 --> 00:17:10,066
Hugely immersive experience.

346
00:17:10,066 --> 00:17:13,710
Because of this format of you're running around with a gun, you've got everything on, you've

347
00:17:13,710 --> 00:17:17,933
got freedom of movement, it is actually a very immersive experience.

348
00:17:17,933 --> 00:17:18,734
Broad audience.

349
00:17:19,274 --> 00:17:24,095
This is like going to the cinema or to any other sort of thing.

350
00:17:24,095 --> 00:17:26,795
This is designed to be, you know, family friendly.

351
00:17:26,795 --> 00:17:28,376
Sure, you're shooting zombies, but it's supposed

352
00:17:28,376 --> 00:17:29,456
to be family friendly.

353
00:17:29,456 --> 00:17:32,436
People from all walks of life, poor people, rich people,

354
00:17:32,436 --> 00:17:35,977
people who are into games, people who are not into games.

355
00:17:35,977 --> 00:17:38,417
In fact, one of the biggest audiences is, you know,

356
00:17:38,417 --> 00:17:42,118
a lot of males from sort of young adult through to middle age

357
00:17:42,118 --> 00:17:43,698
who have never played video games.

358
00:17:43,698 --> 00:17:46,359
And they go out for a party or whatever and come along

359
00:17:46,359 --> 00:17:47,339
and try these things out.

360
00:17:47,799 --> 00:17:50,862
So you need to be very, very careful with how we approach this,

361
00:17:50,862 --> 00:17:52,943
because it wasn't typical gamers.

362
00:17:52,943 --> 00:17:55,465
Shared experience as well.

363
00:17:55,465 --> 00:17:57,327
People, like, they're playing as a team.

364
00:17:57,327 --> 00:17:58,227
It's like, I think, four people.

365
00:17:58,227 --> 00:17:59,769
Two groups of four.

366
00:17:59,769 --> 00:18:00,789
They were playing together,

367
00:18:00,789 --> 00:18:02,611
but they were moving through in sort of two different groups.

368
00:18:02,611 --> 00:18:05,493
Unique environments as you move through.

369
00:18:05,493 --> 00:18:07,154
Each had its own reverb.

370
00:18:07,154 --> 00:18:08,655
I'll get to that in a second.

371
00:18:08,655 --> 00:18:11,217
But the transition points were really easy.

372
00:18:11,217 --> 00:18:12,939
You start off in the bunker,

373
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:14,540
and it's a concrete military bunker.

374
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,922
And to end that level, you walk into the lift.

375
00:18:17,525 --> 00:18:19,665
There's just a line in the sand across the thing.

376
00:18:19,665 --> 00:18:21,065
You walk across that line.

377
00:18:21,065 --> 00:18:22,766
I switch off the bunker reverb.

378
00:18:22,766 --> 00:18:24,826
I switch on the lift reverb.

379
00:18:24,826 --> 00:18:26,786
Again, point of difference.

380
00:18:26,786 --> 00:18:29,287
Doesn't matter if the reverb is 100% exactly right

381
00:18:29,287 --> 00:18:31,627
for that bunker or that elevator.

382
00:18:31,627 --> 00:18:34,648
The average audience is just going to go, hey,

383
00:18:34,648 --> 00:18:35,628
the sound changed.

384
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:37,008
And in fact, no, sorry, they're not.

385
00:18:37,008 --> 00:18:38,929
The average person is just not even

386
00:18:38,929 --> 00:18:40,529
going to notice that the sound changed.

387
00:18:40,529 --> 00:18:43,650
They're just going to go, I walked into an elevator.

388
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,390
And that's the point.

389
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:45,650
If we do our job properly, they shouldn't

390
00:18:45,650 --> 00:18:46,650
notice that sort of stuff.

391
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:51,067
And the zombies was a familiar narrative, and so that was kind of good to work with

392
00:18:51,067 --> 00:18:54,556
because people's expectations were never really challenged too much.

393
00:18:56,265 --> 00:18:59,608
So here's one of the examples of one of the points of impact.

394
00:18:59,608 --> 00:19:00,929
So we've got our trigger line.

395
00:19:00,929 --> 00:19:01,949
So A is our elevator.

396
00:19:01,949 --> 00:19:04,311
And we've got this sort of trigger line.

397
00:19:04,311 --> 00:19:07,834
And when the door opens, so they can fire their guns

398
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:09,555
in the elevator for the one, two, and it goes bang, bang,

399
00:19:09,555 --> 00:19:11,496
bang, and you've got the hum of the engine in the elevator.

400
00:19:11,496 --> 00:19:12,777
And that's all got that reverb.

401
00:19:12,777 --> 00:19:16,099
When the door opens, there is an emitter just outside the door

402
00:19:16,099 --> 00:19:19,222
of the elevator that's basically whoosh, wind, really,

403
00:19:19,222 --> 00:19:19,922
really loud.

404
00:19:19,922 --> 00:19:21,623
And it just feels like the door opens, there's wind.

405
00:19:22,469 --> 00:19:25,531
But in the elevator, it's still just that close space.

406
00:19:25,531 --> 00:19:28,692
As soon as they step across the line, once again, one of

407
00:19:28,692 --> 00:19:30,413
those ambient array things kicks in.

408
00:19:30,413 --> 00:19:33,075
But this time, it's really, really quite strong wind.

409
00:19:33,075 --> 00:19:35,976
And they are up on top of a 40-story building

410
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,237
on top of the city.

411
00:19:37,237 --> 00:19:40,159
And that transition point of being in this nice, cozy

412
00:19:40,159 --> 00:19:43,721
elevator to I'm now up on a thing, and it's open, et

413
00:19:43,721 --> 00:19:45,882
cetera, was really quite impactful for people.

414
00:19:46,562 --> 00:19:50,365
Now one of the other things I did was, as I said, there was reverbs applied for everything,

415
00:19:50,365 --> 00:19:55,168
so you fire a gun in the bunker, it goes bang, you fire a bunker in the elevator and you

416
00:19:55,168 --> 00:19:55,708
get slap echo.

417
00:19:55,708 --> 00:19:59,571
When you got up onto the roof, I did something a little bit different.

418
00:19:59,571 --> 00:20:03,693
I got all the gunshots that had nice long tails and I literally went chop, so I had

419
00:20:03,693 --> 00:20:04,854
about that much of the gunshot.

420
00:20:06,065 --> 00:20:10,288
that was attached to the gun. Bang, bang, bang, bang. Really, really dry.

421
00:20:10,288 --> 00:20:15,412
The tail was attached to an emitter that was about 20 metres in front of them and as soon

422
00:20:15,412 --> 00:20:19,715
as you pulled the trigger it would basically, you go bang and the tail would start there

423
00:20:19,715 --> 00:20:23,058
and then randomly either travel in that direction or that direction. And so what it was was

424
00:20:23,058 --> 00:20:27,881
bang! And it was that echo off the mountains moving

425
00:20:28,475 --> 00:20:32,258
The echo was over there and it was moving off in a direction randomly like that.

426
00:20:32,258 --> 00:20:37,763
The difference that made to standard gunshot sounds was massive, especially with VR and

427
00:20:37,763 --> 00:20:41,767
stuff, because you'd shoot and move like that and you'd still be hearing the echo trailing

428
00:20:41,767 --> 00:20:43,449
off as you were moving around.

429
00:20:43,449 --> 00:20:46,631
And it was just really, it really made a massive impact.

430
00:20:46,631 --> 00:20:50,035
It made all the guns, etc., sound really quite exciting when you're on the roof.

431
00:20:51,253 --> 00:20:54,695
Then what happens is after you've killed some zombies, this helicopter comes along and you

432
00:20:54,695 --> 00:20:56,737
can, you know, 3D model helicopter comes in, that's fine.

433
00:20:56,737 --> 00:20:58,338
And there's another pressure plate.

434
00:20:58,338 --> 00:21:02,321
You walk over the pressure plate into the helicopter and it basically switches off that

435
00:21:02,321 --> 00:21:05,564
ambience array and gives you one of basically the interior of the helicopter.

436
00:21:05,564 --> 00:21:07,485
Now there's a couple of things that's going on here.

437
00:21:07,485 --> 00:21:10,928
You could sort of wonder, well, you know, you're sort of jumping really quickly between

438
00:21:10,928 --> 00:21:13,670
these reverbs and doesn't it sound a little bit weird?

439
00:21:14,550 --> 00:21:18,633
Not in most cases, no, because people are concentrating about stepping into the elevator

440
00:21:18,633 --> 00:21:23,495
and with the helicopter, even if you are at the top of a 40-story building, there's about

441
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:27,557
that much gap and the helicopter's there and you've got to step across that gap.

442
00:21:27,557 --> 00:21:32,480
And I will tell you, even in VR, I had tested this time and time again and I know I'm in

443
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,281
a warehouse but there'd be times where I'd just be going.

444
00:21:34,581 --> 00:21:35,741
Yeah, I am in a warehouse, aren't I?

445
00:21:35,741 --> 00:21:36,341
Yes, good.

446
00:21:36,341 --> 00:21:39,662
Like, literally, the vertigo and sense of threat

447
00:21:39,662 --> 00:21:42,483
you get in VR, your brain is filling in the gaps going,

448
00:21:42,483 --> 00:21:43,863
what on earth are you doing?

449
00:21:43,863 --> 00:21:45,983
You are on top of a building and you're about to step over

450
00:21:45,983 --> 00:21:47,684
a really dangerous gap.

451
00:21:47,684 --> 00:21:49,004
And it really freaks you out.

452
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:51,024
If you haven't tried these warehouse experiences,

453
00:21:51,024 --> 00:21:53,425
they're really worth it for that.

454
00:21:53,425 --> 00:21:54,805
And so again, you're in the helicopter now,

455
00:21:54,805 --> 00:21:56,066
you've got the helicopter interior,

456
00:21:56,066 --> 00:21:59,246
but I'm playing helicopter exterior in the doorway.

457
00:21:59,246 --> 00:22:00,907
So you're getting a blend of both of them.

458
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:05,417
So there's a whole bunch of things going on here with arrays and mono sounds there and

459
00:22:05,417 --> 00:22:10,101
stereo sounds there and 3D sounds there and all of these things layer together to give

460
00:22:10,101 --> 00:22:12,202
a really significant impact.

461
00:22:12,202 --> 00:22:17,807
And we, for this particular company, they approached me at one point and said, so we,

462
00:22:17,807 --> 00:22:21,990
whenever we build these, we actually get regular focus groups, you know, when we're getting

463
00:22:21,990 --> 00:22:25,353
close to the end and just to sort of get some feedback and things we want to change and

464
00:22:25,353 --> 00:22:27,315
we've never had anybody mention the audio ever.

465
00:22:27,315 --> 00:22:29,677
And we had a couple of people go.

466
00:22:30,257 --> 00:22:33,658
wow, this experience is like three times more impactful

467
00:22:33,658 --> 00:22:36,479
than the last ones, or spooky, or whatever the adjective

468
00:22:36,479 --> 00:22:37,420
they used.

469
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:40,981
They said this was so much more immersive

470
00:22:40,981 --> 00:22:42,441
than their previous ones.

471
00:22:42,441 --> 00:22:44,222
And in a couple of cases, they did actually

472
00:22:44,222 --> 00:22:45,142
mention the audio.

473
00:22:45,822 --> 00:22:47,263
I'm unsure whether it's a good thing or not,

474
00:22:47,263 --> 00:22:49,263
because the audio, when it does its job properly,

475
00:22:49,263 --> 00:22:50,504
shouldn't be noticeable.

476
00:22:50,504 --> 00:22:52,044
But I think in this particular case,

477
00:22:52,044 --> 00:22:54,305
it was a set group of focused people

478
00:22:54,305 --> 00:22:56,646
who had played the experiences before.

479
00:22:56,646 --> 00:22:58,366
And they were like, this one is better.

480
00:22:58,366 --> 00:23:00,047
And they were asked, why do you think so?

481
00:23:00,047 --> 00:23:02,087
And they'd sort of said, well, because of the audio.

482
00:23:02,087 --> 00:23:05,789
So in that particular case.

483
00:23:05,789 --> 00:23:06,989
Weapons were all dry sounds.

484
00:23:06,989 --> 00:23:10,030
Environmental reverb added, and tails, as I said.

485
00:23:10,030 --> 00:23:12,731
Subtle environmental details had a huge impact.

486
00:23:12,731 --> 00:23:14,371
This is one of the other things I do.

487
00:23:14,371 --> 00:23:15,051
In the bunker.

488
00:23:15,757 --> 00:23:18,879
There's computers and stuff everywhere, et cetera, et cetera, but over in a corner there's

489
00:23:18,879 --> 00:23:21,361
like a pipe there and things over there.

490
00:23:21,361 --> 00:23:24,583
And I thought, well, people are going to be standing around, this is when they're all

491
00:23:24,583 --> 00:23:27,585
coming loading into the level one by one and sort of testing their guns, et cetera.

492
00:23:27,585 --> 00:23:30,688
And I thought, let's reward the players for investigating.

493
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:32,209
So the pipe that was over in the corner.

494
00:23:32,509 --> 00:23:34,810
I basically put a gurgling sound in it.

495
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:38,513
But it literally, you only hear it when you go right up to it and you're within a couple

496
00:23:38,513 --> 00:23:39,113
of metres of it.

497
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:42,015
And so all of a sudden it's like, you know, and people are like, hey, this is cool.

498
00:23:42,015 --> 00:23:45,116
And they'd call their friends over to say, check out this, it's a gurgling pipe.

499
00:23:45,116 --> 00:23:50,239
Because it was like just a mini little prize for taking the effort of going over into the

500
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:51,220
corner of the room.

501
00:23:51,220 --> 00:23:54,562
And that's another thing that we can do with sound of like, you know, you've got this big

502
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:56,983
area, it's like, I mean, if we were modelling this room.

503
00:23:57,623 --> 00:24:00,924
There's no real sounds going in this room, but if we were going to, to make it interesting,

504
00:24:00,924 --> 00:24:05,206
we could add all sorts of things to basically reward our audience.

505
00:24:05,206 --> 00:24:13,828
So the general concept, understand that your audience is likely curious.

506
00:24:13,828 --> 00:24:15,729
Give them things to investigate.

507
00:24:15,729 --> 00:24:19,310
Create things that add life to the environment.

508
00:24:19,310 --> 00:24:22,110
I think audio should always reward for investigation.

509
00:24:22,979 --> 00:24:25,161
You don't have to be really overt about it.

510
00:24:25,161 --> 00:24:27,303
You don't have to put it absolutely everywhere.

511
00:24:27,303 --> 00:24:29,725
But just in general, I think there's things that we can do

512
00:24:29,725 --> 00:24:32,247
with audio where there doesn't have to be an animated object.

513
00:24:32,247 --> 00:24:34,369
There doesn't have to be a physical thing there.

514
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:37,292
We could put a sound in that corner there that basically

515
00:24:37,292 --> 00:24:39,053
sounded like maybe there was somebody having a conversation

516
00:24:39,053 --> 00:24:40,314
on the other side of the wall.

517
00:24:40,314 --> 00:24:43,337
There's no assets needed other than audio.

518
00:24:43,337 --> 00:24:46,400
We can add to narrative and stuff like that as well.

519
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:48,121
So as I said, the player who takes the time to walk to the

520
00:24:48,121 --> 00:24:50,483
unremarkable corner discovers a gurgling pipe.

521
00:24:55,187 --> 00:24:55,747
Not much time.

522
00:24:55,747 --> 00:24:58,588
All right, I'll go through this very quickly.

523
00:24:58,588 --> 00:25:00,729
The military simulator was quite different.

524
00:25:00,729 --> 00:25:02,529
Very specific audience and purpose.

525
00:25:02,529 --> 00:25:04,110
This was to train people to save lives.

526
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:06,651
Serious purpose.

527
00:25:06,651 --> 00:25:08,671
They believed they knew what they needed,

528
00:25:08,671 --> 00:25:11,392
and that was probably the biggest takeaway from this one.

529
00:25:11,392 --> 00:25:13,052
So, very specific audience and purpose.

530
00:25:13,052 --> 00:25:13,993
Limited scope was helpful,

531
00:25:13,993 --> 00:25:16,493
but a very high level of expectation.

532
00:25:16,493 --> 00:25:18,094
They were like, oh, this is serious.

533
00:25:18,094 --> 00:25:19,514
This is very, very important.

534
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:20,735
And initially it was daunting.

535
00:25:22,473 --> 00:25:26,278
But they, as I said, the client missed some opportunities for improvements.

536
00:25:26,278 --> 00:25:29,201
And I'll give you an example of this.

537
00:25:29,201 --> 00:25:31,644
Again, the array for the wind, etc.

538
00:25:31,644 --> 00:25:33,126
But I said to them at one point...

539
00:25:34,267 --> 00:25:44,274
What about the enemy's guns? This is training for you guys to walk around and I've given you the correct, I've recorded the military weapons and I've given you the correct sounds and all this other stuff like I did with the tails, etc. that was all good.

540
00:25:44,274 --> 00:25:51,859
But I said to them, what about the enemy's weapons? What are the enemy, you need to have the sounds for the enemy's weapons? And I'm like, oh we don't care about those. I'm like, sorry, what?

541
00:25:54,084 --> 00:25:55,926
you don't, this is not a game.

542
00:25:55,926 --> 00:25:58,208
They kept saying this is not a game, this is not a game.

543
00:25:58,208 --> 00:26:01,370
Actually, what they should have said is,

544
00:26:01,370 --> 00:26:02,911
the honest truth was, and I don't mean to be nasty,

545
00:26:02,911 --> 00:26:03,712
but the honest truth was,

546
00:26:03,712 --> 00:26:05,394
we really don't understand what we need

547
00:26:05,394 --> 00:26:08,476
and the game industry could teach us a whole bunch of stuff.

548
00:26:08,476 --> 00:26:10,338
Because from my point of view,

549
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:11,939
I've spent five years in the army,

550
00:26:11,939 --> 00:26:14,061
I know people who have been in combat.

551
00:26:14,061 --> 00:26:16,122
And from a survival point of view,

552
00:26:16,122 --> 00:26:18,284
if you can't tell the difference between a sniper rifle

553
00:26:18,284 --> 00:26:19,926
that can kill you at two miles

554
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,508
and a submachine gun that can only kill you

555
00:26:22,508 --> 00:26:23,088
from 20 feet.

556
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,441
you're not going to last very long.

557
00:26:25,441 --> 00:26:28,782
And especially in this case, we were adding reverb

558
00:26:28,782 --> 00:26:29,663
to all sorts of things.

559
00:26:29,663 --> 00:26:31,224
So you hear the sound of an AK-47,

560
00:26:31,224 --> 00:26:33,184
ah that's an enemy's gun.

561
00:26:33,184 --> 00:26:35,926
Was it close where it's a threat or did it sound

562
00:26:35,926 --> 00:26:38,667
like it was a mile away where it's irrelevant?

563
00:26:38,667 --> 00:26:42,048
Did it sound like it was coming from a building or the streets?

564
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,001
Where do I need to look?

565
00:26:44,001 --> 00:26:45,883
So I was astounded that they just like,

566
00:26:45,883 --> 00:26:47,344
oh, we don't care about sound.

567
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:50,768
And there was a level of arrogance there,

568
00:26:50,768 --> 00:26:54,111
which I was the client of their client, so their choice.

569
00:26:54,111 --> 00:26:58,715
But I think I actually wrote a blog post about this

570
00:26:58,715 --> 00:27:01,097
afterwards and put it on, not specifically naming them,

571
00:27:01,097 --> 00:27:04,480
but putting this on of like, underestimate

572
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:06,182
the importance of audio at your peril

573
00:27:06,182 --> 00:27:07,483
if you are creating simulators.

574
00:27:08,345 --> 00:27:12,666
The way we audio our sense of hearing is our critical danger sense.

575
00:27:12,666 --> 00:27:19,947
So I think in this particular case, in this argument, you will always have all three elements.

576
00:27:19,947 --> 00:27:24,468
The weighting will change per the needs of the project.

577
00:27:24,468 --> 00:27:28,889
So VR regatta was probably immerse, then inform, then impact, because we need to inform where

578
00:27:28,889 --> 00:27:30,290
the wind was going for sailing purposes.

579
00:27:31,150 --> 00:27:33,971
Whereas Outbreak Origins was impact first,

580
00:27:33,971 --> 00:27:36,491
immerse them in the thing, inform last of all.

581
00:27:36,491 --> 00:27:38,772
There's a zombie over there, that's all you really need to know.

582
00:27:38,772 --> 00:27:42,233
Whereas the Military Simulator was inform,

583
00:27:42,233 --> 00:27:45,554
immerse to make it a realistic environment,

584
00:27:45,554 --> 00:27:49,615
but impact, not really, it was a serious purpose project.

585
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:52,016
So I think in that regard,

586
00:27:52,016 --> 00:27:54,576
it was quite interesting that when I started doing this,

587
00:27:54,576 --> 00:27:58,237
I realised, oh wow, this is the perfect trio of projects

588
00:27:58,237 --> 00:27:59,838
to explore this sort of concept.

589
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,973
So, it is important to meet the needs of a project,

590
00:28:04,973 --> 00:28:06,694
but the project will often define

591
00:28:06,694 --> 00:28:09,376
what is possible and feasible.

592
00:28:09,376 --> 00:28:11,098
You know, if the client's saying,

593
00:28:11,098 --> 00:28:12,819
that's our scope, doesn't matter whether

594
00:28:12,819 --> 00:28:15,201
it would be awesome if I could do that.

595
00:28:15,201 --> 00:28:17,623
Just, you know, we've got to work within that.

596
00:28:17,623 --> 00:28:18,743
We've got to understand that.

597
00:28:18,743 --> 00:28:19,904
Our job is to serve the clients.

598
00:28:19,904 --> 00:28:23,848
It can be tempting to add cool things because it's cool,

599
00:28:23,848 --> 00:28:27,771
but does it really add value to that specific project?

600
00:28:28,419 --> 00:28:31,401
Some cases yes or no, you need to consider that.

601
00:28:31,401 --> 00:28:34,023
VR requires a new language, and I sort of started with this,

602
00:28:34,023 --> 00:28:35,384
to communicate with our audience.

603
00:28:35,384 --> 00:28:38,907
Evaluate the importance of the elements of immerse, impact,

604
00:28:38,907 --> 00:28:42,350
and inform and tailor your audio to suit.

605
00:28:42,350 --> 00:28:46,293
So work out, if we consider this our new language potentially,

606
00:28:46,293 --> 00:28:48,495
then maybe which dialect are we using

607
00:28:48,495 --> 00:28:51,678
for the specific audience for that specific purpose.

608
00:28:53,252 --> 00:28:56,074
And so that's the last slide.

609
00:28:56,074 --> 00:28:57,675
We have a couple of minutes left,

610
00:28:57,675 --> 00:28:59,536
and the organizer sort of generously said

611
00:28:59,536 --> 00:29:01,578
we could probably go a couple of minutes late with questions

612
00:29:01,578 --> 00:29:03,199
because we've got that bit of time.

613
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:05,180
So we'll have some questions if anybody has them,

614
00:29:05,180 --> 00:29:06,601
but otherwise, thank you very much, everyone.

615
00:29:06,601 --> 00:29:17,008
applause

616
00:29:17,008 --> 00:29:19,970
Hello, thanks very much for the talk.

617
00:29:20,100 --> 00:29:24,183
I was just curious on that point about adding value to the specific project.

618
00:29:24,183 --> 00:29:28,727
A lot of the stuff you were describing, like on the boat, putting in the level of audio

619
00:29:28,727 --> 00:29:32,329
detail is something I as a sound designer would absolutely adore doing.

620
00:29:32,329 --> 00:29:36,873
Was there any point in these projects or others that you've worked on where you had to kind

621
00:29:36,873 --> 00:29:41,796
of scale that back because you're doing too much cool audio stuff and the project was

622
00:29:41,796 --> 00:29:44,938
not supporting that granular level of detail?

623
00:29:45,789 --> 00:29:49,132
No, I understand what you're saying.

624
00:29:49,132 --> 00:29:53,075
No, for the two creative ones, I pretty much met what was needed.

625
00:29:53,075 --> 00:29:56,678
I mean, I probably did a little bit more than the client was expecting for the zombie one,

626
00:29:56,678 --> 00:30:00,642
but they were delighted for it and they were like, this is great.

627
00:30:00,642 --> 00:30:04,725
The military one was the one where they kind of went, nah, we don't care, so I just stopped.

628
00:30:04,725 --> 00:30:06,727
Right at the beginning, they pretty much said, we don't care.

629
00:30:06,727 --> 00:30:09,169
So I went, alright, well there's your gun sounds, there's your ambience, there's a couple

630
00:30:09,169 --> 00:30:10,310
of booms in the background.

631
00:30:10,310 --> 00:30:11,331
And I just went, yeah.

632
00:30:11,591 --> 00:30:13,554
They've literally said, we don't care.

633
00:30:13,554 --> 00:30:15,857
And so my client, who was the one making the thing,

634
00:30:15,857 --> 00:30:17,759
said, yeah, they don't want it.

635
00:30:17,759 --> 00:30:18,520
Don't waste time on it.

636
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:21,243
So it was lucky that they said it then rather than at the end

637
00:30:21,243 --> 00:30:22,485
after I'd done a whole bunch of stuff,

638
00:30:22,485 --> 00:30:23,426
and they're like, oh, take it out.

639
00:30:23,426 --> 00:30:24,868
So that was good at least.

640
00:30:24,868 --> 00:30:28,132
But the Vow Rigatta one was.

641
00:30:28,212 --> 00:30:29,793
really about the experience.

642
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:32,155
The people who made it were people who sail boats.

643
00:30:32,155 --> 00:30:36,277
And they said they wanted their players, their audience,

644
00:30:36,277 --> 00:30:39,179
to really, really, really like they were sailing a boat.

645
00:30:39,179 --> 00:30:40,740
And the overall feedback from that one

646
00:30:40,740 --> 00:30:42,381
was people just going, we love how this sounds.

647
00:30:42,381 --> 00:30:45,103
So in these, I know exactly what you're saying,

648
00:30:45,103 --> 00:30:47,304
and I think, yes, there is a risk of doing that.

649
00:30:47,304 --> 00:30:51,427
Perhaps I was lucky that in this case, I went just far enough.

650
00:30:51,427 --> 00:30:51,767
Thank you.

651
00:30:51,767 --> 00:30:52,067
No worries.

652
00:30:53,339 --> 00:30:54,820
Hey, Stefan.

653
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:58,783
I have a question about using when you split out

654
00:30:58,783 --> 00:31:02,746
the ambiences as separate emitters

655
00:31:02,746 --> 00:31:04,547
instead of just having one bed.

656
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:10,112
Are those stereo, or are they like left mono splits

657
00:31:10,112 --> 00:31:11,873
and you're using the left on the right?

658
00:31:11,873 --> 00:31:13,594
So you're talking the array thing?

659
00:31:13,594 --> 00:31:14,175
Yeah.

660
00:31:14,175 --> 00:31:15,836
Really good question.

661
00:31:15,836 --> 00:31:16,056
So.

662
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:23,345
If I had the option, I would potentially use a quad microphone array or an ambisonic microphone.

663
00:31:23,345 --> 00:31:27,749
Like if I was going out freshly to record it, I would do that and then I've got my nice

664
00:31:27,749 --> 00:31:29,651
sort of things.

665
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:35,996
If I had stereo, what I would do is go, oh look, I've got a 60 second stereo file of

666
00:31:35,996 --> 00:31:37,998
wind and I go chop.

667
00:31:39,049 --> 00:31:42,311
30 seconds, bam, bam, bam, bam.

668
00:31:42,311 --> 00:31:43,672
But it actually can even work with mono.

669
00:31:43,672 --> 00:31:45,834
Like, I went through some of my lines, and one of the wind

670
00:31:45,834 --> 00:31:48,075
sounds that I had that I wanted to crossfade to, I went, this

671
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:50,617
is a really lovely wind sound, but I only

672
00:31:50,617 --> 00:31:51,958
recorded it in mono years ago.

673
00:31:51,958 --> 00:31:53,379
But I went mono, mono, mono, mono.

674
00:31:53,379 --> 00:31:56,981
Because of course, again, if it's two minutes long, 30

675
00:31:56,981 --> 00:31:58,562
seconds, 30 seconds, 30 seconds.

676
00:31:59,502 --> 00:32:03,304
We're not doing true stereo in the nice panny way.

677
00:32:03,304 --> 00:32:07,447
What we're doing is we're setting up emitters that are playing a sound within a 3D world

678
00:32:07,447 --> 00:32:08,768
that has all the attenuation, etc.

679
00:32:08,768 --> 00:32:15,112
So even mono, and in fact over the years I've used mono for creating most of my environments

680
00:32:15,112 --> 00:32:17,813
because you chop it up and position it, etc.

681
00:32:17,813 --> 00:32:21,876
So you can pretty much use any format you want.

682
00:32:21,916 --> 00:32:25,018
What I would say is, grab some files,

683
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:28,219
throw them in, and then, you know,

684
00:32:28,219 --> 00:32:31,141
add salt to taste sort of thing.

685
00:32:31,141 --> 00:32:32,902
Just play around with it until it gets

686
00:32:32,902 --> 00:32:34,903
to where you want it to be.

687
00:32:34,903 --> 00:32:36,264
Cool, and just adding on to that,

688
00:32:36,264 --> 00:32:40,006
since there are no more questions.

689
00:32:40,006 --> 00:32:41,587
No, go for it.

690
00:32:41,587 --> 00:32:44,908
Do you ever use the waveform of the audio

691
00:32:44,908 --> 00:32:46,189
to move the sound around?

692
00:32:46,189 --> 00:32:48,931
For example, if a sound has a Doppler effect,

693
00:32:48,931 --> 00:32:51,812
or if, for example, like a wind sound might have

694
00:32:52,213 --> 00:32:56,094
on the left channel it swells and then on the right channel it swells and then kind

695
00:32:56,094 --> 00:32:58,734
of, you know, alternates.

696
00:32:58,734 --> 00:33:07,817
Do you ever split that in left and right channel and then use the sound to move the positioning

697
00:33:07,817 --> 00:33:08,337
of the sound?

698
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:13,638
So what you're saying is, if I don't have a, so if the wind is actually moving rather

699
00:33:13,638 --> 00:33:18,600
than just being a static rain, or if the rain instead of just being rain it's like...

700
00:33:20,033 --> 00:33:24,616
of rain, so there are actually, so there are kind of accents within, if there are

701
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:29,759
accents within the files that I'm using, do I use those to determine what's going on?

702
00:33:29,759 --> 00:33:34,562
Like if there's two, if you have two static emitters, and then you know

703
00:33:34,562 --> 00:33:39,345
pretending like the sound is coming from left to right, instead of manually, you

704
00:33:39,345 --> 00:33:43,227
know, having that scripted, you know, as a moving sound.

705
00:33:44,045 --> 00:33:47,307
What I would probably do is I would probably use those separately.

706
00:33:47,307 --> 00:33:53,832
I would probably still set up my array with my really, really subtle, fairly flat ones,

707
00:33:53,832 --> 00:33:58,955
and then what I might do is set up those ones you've just talked about with a surge, I might

708
00:33:58,955 --> 00:33:59,715
have them as a...

709
00:34:02,635 --> 00:34:07,799
a nice clean fade in, surge, fade out, so they're clean at each end, and then might

710
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,140
have them so that they trigger on specific points.

711
00:34:10,140 --> 00:34:15,043
So like, if I turn my head at a time, trigger one of those somewhere, because it's just

712
00:34:15,043 --> 00:34:17,005
sort of, again, it's highlighting that point of difference.

713
00:34:17,005 --> 00:34:21,167
Whether it's actually realistic that me turning my head affects the wind, and we know that

714
00:34:21,167 --> 00:34:24,930
it's not going to in that way, it's just that perception of, oh, I did something and something

715
00:34:24,930 --> 00:34:25,610
happened.

716
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:28,413
So there are kind of examples of that.

717
00:34:28,413 --> 00:34:32,038
I mean, one of the best examples is the film wasn't very good,

718
00:34:32,038 --> 00:34:32,939
and I watched it many years ago.

719
00:34:32,939 --> 00:34:35,622
There's a film, I think Ben Affleck was in it,

720
00:34:35,622 --> 00:34:38,225
that was like the Pearl Harbor film where they, you know,

721
00:34:38,225 --> 00:34:40,888
the Japanese attack and then the Americans, you know,

722
00:34:40,888 --> 00:34:42,570
two American pilots beat them off.

723
00:34:42,570 --> 00:34:44,333
And what was really interesting about that was,

724
00:34:45,687 --> 00:34:48,889
With an airplane, if an airplane is just sitting there and you're recording it, the airplane

725
00:34:48,889 --> 00:34:52,411
just goes brrrr, you know, loudly or whatever.

726
00:34:52,411 --> 00:34:57,455
The nyeow sound only happens when you're here and an airplane passes you and it's that Doppler

727
00:34:57,455 --> 00:34:58,075
effect.

728
00:34:58,075 --> 00:35:01,757
And yet, when you watch that film, it's showing scenes of...

729
00:35:02,245 --> 00:35:05,666
the camera, like here's the aeroplane, here's the cockpit, so you can just sort of see a

730
00:35:05,666 --> 00:35:09,268
little bit of the aeroplane fuselage, the cockpit and the guy sitting in it, right,

731
00:35:09,268 --> 00:35:11,628
and they're showing you as though it's a fixed camera.

732
00:35:11,628 --> 00:35:15,350
So the plane's flying like this, the camera, and the whole time you're just seeing the

733
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:20,871
dude in the cockpit, right, and yet the sound, half the time, every time they showed one

734
00:35:20,871 --> 00:35:23,512
of those things, you're getting a sound going, and I'm like...

735
00:35:25,070 --> 00:35:27,250
doesn't match what's going on visually at all.

736
00:35:27,250 --> 00:35:28,131
It really doesn't.

737
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:30,211
It's completely wrong, because it should

738
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:31,511
be a bypass left to right.

739
00:35:31,511 --> 00:35:34,732
What we should be hearing here is just a constant brrrr.

740
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:36,753
But obviously, Hollywood looked at that and went, wow, yeah,

741
00:35:36,753 --> 00:35:38,473
but a constant brrr is not going to really work.

742
00:35:38,473 --> 00:35:41,114
So we'll put something in to represent that the plane's

743
00:35:41,114 --> 00:35:42,554
there and the plane's moving.

744
00:35:42,554 --> 00:35:46,815
So it is technically absolutely the wrong sound for that scene.

745
00:35:46,815 --> 00:35:48,696
And yet, who noticed that?

746
00:35:49,342 --> 00:35:54,105
So what I'm getting with this is that there's a whole bunch of smoke and mirrors we can do with sound

747
00:35:54,105 --> 00:35:56,846
and 99.9% of the people, I would argue, that a whole bunch of sound designers who went and saw that

748
00:35:56,846 --> 00:36:00,408
probably didn't even notice it. You know, we just go, oh, the plane's moving and that's fine.

749
00:36:00,408 --> 00:36:05,171
Our brain is great at filling in gaps. And so I like the idea of what you're saying

750
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:08,633
but I would use it just to know I turn my head and there's a swoosh sort of thing

751
00:36:08,633 --> 00:36:11,275
because it would just enhance that whole sense of...

752
00:36:11,395 --> 00:36:13,655
I'm doing stuff and the world's interacting with me.

753
00:36:13,655 --> 00:36:16,156
I mean, it's a great idea, and I'd almost be tempted

754
00:36:16,156 --> 00:36:17,356
to go home and open that project.

755
00:36:17,356 --> 00:36:19,696
I'm just throwing one of those in to see

756
00:36:19,696 --> 00:36:21,377
what the effect is.

757
00:36:21,377 --> 00:36:22,237
Is it too big?

758
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:25,698
Do I need to make it more subtle?

759
00:36:25,698 --> 00:36:25,978
Yeah.

760
00:36:25,978 --> 00:36:28,498
Final question, on your car example,

761
00:36:28,498 --> 00:36:31,199
if you're inside your car from the previous talk,

762
00:36:31,199 --> 00:36:33,419
how would you set up your emitters

763
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:36,200
so that if I'm hearing the engine from inside,

764
00:36:36,200 --> 00:36:38,640
that it's coming from the entire...

765
00:36:39,789 --> 00:36:43,511
panel, you know, the wall of the car instead of like...

766
00:36:43,511 --> 00:36:48,334
I might even put two emitters there so there's sort of, you know, one, or make the emitters

767
00:36:48,334 --> 00:36:50,735
big, wide, so they fill that whole area.

768
00:36:50,735 --> 00:36:54,477
Obviously filter it a lot so that you've got the inside the car sound sort of stuff.

769
00:36:54,477 --> 00:37:00,401
But I would definitely position it there rather than on me here because it's there in the

770
00:37:00,401 --> 00:37:00,641
car.

771
00:37:00,641 --> 00:37:00,881
Yeah, cool.

772
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:01,461
Awesome, thank you.

773
00:37:01,461 --> 00:37:03,182
All right, this probably should be the last question but...

774
00:37:03,647 --> 00:37:08,651
Great talk. I see from your bio you've been doing work in AR as well. I was wondering

775
00:37:08,651 --> 00:37:12,434
if you had any insights on blending real world sounds with AR.

776
00:37:12,434 --> 00:37:17,418
Fantastic question. That's almost a talk on itself, but I'll try and give you some information.

777
00:37:17,418 --> 00:37:22,883
No, no, no, you're absolutely right. And this is one of the big problems with AR is that

778
00:37:22,883 --> 00:37:27,827
we need to be able to hear it, but if – I'm a Star Wars fan, so let's just say we've

779
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:32,210
got an AR R2-D2 there, there's a couple of things that goes on.

780
00:37:32,732 --> 00:37:40,397
R2-D2 needs to sound like he's there, not here, not here from mono.

781
00:37:40,397 --> 00:37:42,758
And quite often a lot of the HRTFs, this is a struggle.

782
00:37:42,758 --> 00:37:45,239
I mean, down on the expo floor I was looking at people going, oh, we've got this audio

783
00:37:45,239 --> 00:37:49,262
solution and I'm like, sure, it sounds like it's swimming around but it never sounds like

784
00:37:49,262 --> 00:37:51,543
it's there three feet in front of me.

785
00:37:51,543 --> 00:37:57,847
And so you've got that aspect of really trying to nail where it feels like it is.

786
00:37:59,067 --> 00:38:03,788
Really judicious use of reverb might help that a little bit, but technically if R2D2

787
00:38:03,788 --> 00:38:09,590
is there and goes beep, I should get a direct signal to me here, and then I should get a

788
00:38:09,590 --> 00:38:13,450
bounce signal off there, and that's part of what tells my brain R2D2 is there, and all

789
00:38:13,450 --> 00:38:15,071
the other reflections and stuff.

790
00:38:15,071 --> 00:38:19,152
Unless you're going to do lots of ray tracing and stuff, you're not going to get that.

791
00:38:19,152 --> 00:38:21,712
So again, smoke and mirrors.

792
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:23,973
You just have to kind of pretend.

793
00:38:23,973 --> 00:38:28,355
If I had the ability to sort of do this,

794
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:31,737
one of the things I would probably try to do is,

795
00:38:31,737 --> 00:38:32,777
if you had the tech to do it,

796
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,038
is, you know, you've got your HoloLens or your Magic Leap,

797
00:38:35,038 --> 00:38:36,759
and it's got a built-in microphone.

798
00:38:36,759 --> 00:38:38,800
I'd want that built-in microphone to basically go,

799
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,481
I'm going to listen to the environment that I'm in,

800
00:38:41,481 --> 00:38:44,242
analyze that, and then use that to convolve

801
00:38:44,242 --> 00:38:46,203
the sounds that's coming out of that,

802
00:38:46,203 --> 00:38:47,584
at least to try and guess.

803
00:38:47,932 --> 00:38:57,840
the sort of space that I'm in, but generally I would have it be mostly flat, like no reverb,

804
00:38:57,840 --> 00:39:02,264
etc, etc, and if I couldn't do that, maybe I'd just do a best guess.

805
00:39:02,264 --> 00:39:06,547
Again, I'd get the cameras that are built into these devices to go, hey, what does it

806
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:07,128
look like we're in?

807
00:39:07,128 --> 00:39:12,032
We're in a big space, cool, apply big space reverb 6 preset.

808
00:39:12,032 --> 00:39:13,173
It is super hard.

809
00:39:13,173 --> 00:39:15,995
The other problem is that if R2-D2 is in this room...

810
00:39:17,540 --> 00:39:19,842
and you're all talking, you know what I mean?

811
00:39:19,842 --> 00:39:21,764
It should sound like, well, R2-D2's sound

812
00:39:21,764 --> 00:39:24,767
is blending with yours, and maybe,

813
00:39:24,767 --> 00:39:26,568
if I'm looking at you and you're speaking,

814
00:39:26,568 --> 00:39:27,970
I can focus on what you're saying.

815
00:39:28,977 --> 00:39:33,438
If all of you are talking really loudly and I look down on R2D2, I'm now focusing on that.

816
00:39:33,438 --> 00:39:37,959
And there are most of the sorts of audio apps and stuff have focal cone sorts of things

817
00:39:37,959 --> 00:39:41,919
where the thing that you are looking at will be slightly louder than everything else.

818
00:39:41,919 --> 00:39:46,420
But again, that takes a lot of tuning because it's like how wide, what's the angle of that

819
00:39:46,420 --> 00:39:50,241
focal cone and then what's the difference in volume between that and what's outside

820
00:39:50,241 --> 00:39:51,682
it and there's a whole bunch of other things.

821
00:39:51,682 --> 00:39:54,222
So again, it still comes down to smoke and mirrors.

822
00:39:54,222 --> 00:39:56,863
And I think as much as the technology is critical.

823
00:39:57,679 --> 00:40:03,091
I'm still placing smoke and mirrors as being a better solution than the technology right

824
00:40:03,091 --> 00:40:03,251
now.

825
00:40:03,251 --> 00:40:05,516
Or at least, sorry, let me revise that.

826
00:40:07,091 --> 00:40:12,717
smoke and mirrors supporting the technology whilst the technology is developed and evolves

827
00:40:12,717 --> 00:40:19,083
further and maybe as the technology evolves further we can relinquish its reliance on

828
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:21,105
the smoke and mirrors and dial those down a bit.

829
00:40:21,105 --> 00:40:26,130
But then again, I'll leave it on this point, I mean any Hollywood movie that we look at

830
00:40:26,130 --> 00:40:29,313
is so devolved from a reality.

831
00:40:29,313 --> 00:40:31,575
I mean the handguns sound like Howitzers.

832
00:40:31,995 --> 00:40:35,976
you know, something the size, you know, a dragon the size of my palm makes a noise the

833
00:40:35,976 --> 00:40:37,217
size of a 40-foot dinosaur.

834
00:40:37,217 --> 00:40:42,978
So if you're wanting to make, if you're trying to convince me that something's there, that's

835
00:40:42,978 --> 00:40:43,418
fine.

836
00:40:43,418 --> 00:40:48,560
If you're trying to convince me that there's something that's heroic Hollywood that's there,

837
00:40:48,560 --> 00:40:51,281
that gives you a lot more carte blanche to have R2-D2 all of a sudden sound like a giant

838
00:40:51,281 --> 00:40:51,381
T-Rex.

839
00:40:51,381 --> 00:40:51,821
Thank you.

840
00:40:51,821 --> 00:40:52,261
No worries.

841
00:40:52,261 --> 00:40:52,481
All right.

842
00:40:52,481 --> 00:40:54,522
Thank you very much, everyone.
