1
00:01:11,407 --> 00:01:11,468
You

2
00:04:47,126 --> 00:04:52,291
Ladies and gentlemen, the IGF and Choice Awards will begin in a few moments.

3
00:04:52,291 --> 00:04:54,533
We ask that you please take your seats.

4
00:05:18,004 --> 00:05:18,347
Bye.

5
00:05:36,373 --> 00:05:51,984
Stay super.

6
00:06:18,454 --> 00:06:18,958
Bye!

7
00:06:18,958 --> 00:06:19,320
Bye!

8
00:09:55,692 --> 00:09:59,378
Ladies and gentlemen, tonight's program is about to begin.

9
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:02,743
Please take your seats as we will be starting momentarily.

10
00:10:02,743 --> 00:10:05,628
Also at this time, if you would turn off your cell phone

11
00:10:05,628 --> 00:10:08,933
and other electronic devices, it would be greatly appreciated.

12
00:11:00,664 --> 00:11:05,488
Please welcome the chairperson of the Independent Games Festival, Kelly Wallach.

13
00:11:05,488 --> 00:11:22,442
Hello everyone, and welcome to the 20th Annual Independent Games Festival Awards.

14
00:11:29,179 --> 00:11:37,081
It's an honor to be here tonight and congratulations to the finalists and honorable mentions and to all the folks who submitted their games,

15
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:51,424
the members of the community who helped judge our pool of nearly 600 applicants, and to all the jury members who dedicated their time and expertise to having countless discussions on this year's award categories.

16
00:11:51,424 --> 00:11:57,866
It's an incredible amount of work and is only made possible by the contributions of hundreds of dedicated members of the community.

17
00:11:59,109 --> 00:12:04,473
I'm constantly humbled by the efforts and I feel incredibly grateful to be a part of

18
00:12:04,473 --> 00:12:04,533
it.

19
00:12:04,533 --> 00:12:07,315
Also, a big thank you to our sponsors.

20
00:12:07,315 --> 00:12:18,984
So the IGF Platinum sponsor, ID at Xbox.

21
00:12:18,984 --> 00:12:21,265
And the IGF platform sponsor, Steam.

22
00:12:29,605 --> 00:12:33,426
As technology continues to move to the forefront of our lives,

23
00:12:33,426 --> 00:12:35,847
games are going to continue to become an integral way

24
00:12:35,847 --> 00:12:40,347
to connect, explore, and learn about the world around us.

25
00:12:40,347 --> 00:12:41,988
Games can also be a stepping stone

26
00:12:41,988 --> 00:12:44,428
to learning the language and skills necessary to exist

27
00:12:44,428 --> 00:12:47,649
in this changing world and to build and create

28
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:50,009
the tools of the future.

29
00:12:50,009 --> 00:12:52,470
It's imperative that we give this opportunity and language

30
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:54,070
to as many people as possible.

31
00:12:55,306 --> 00:12:59,188
If the same content is made by the same people with the same experiences over and over,

32
00:12:59,188 --> 00:13:03,670
we're going to turn off not only fans, but new creators as well.

33
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:08,933
If you don't see yourself reflected in the world around you, it limits your possibilities.

34
00:13:08,933 --> 00:13:11,154
It limits what's possible for all of us.

35
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:17,122
If you look at a movie like Black Panther, not only is this a touchstone, but it's vibrant,

36
00:13:17,122 --> 00:13:18,022
it's new, and it's exciting.

37
00:13:18,022 --> 00:13:22,744
And one of the reasons that it's so captivating is that every inch and every second of the

38
00:13:22,744 --> 00:13:27,807
film exists in a world that explores a rich history and culture long uncharted by mainstream

39
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,028
blockbuster storytelling.

40
00:13:30,028 --> 00:13:33,750
Audiences are hungry for new experiences, for new content, and new worlds.

41
00:13:34,547 --> 00:13:37,009
You see this exploration growing in games as well,

42
00:13:37,009 --> 00:13:38,710
with roots in the indie community.

43
00:13:38,710 --> 00:13:41,592
Games like Arian, Azura, and Malacca,

44
00:13:41,592 --> 00:13:44,074
that integrate storytelling of vast cultural worlds

45
00:13:44,074 --> 00:13:46,416
from all corners of the globe.

46
00:13:46,416 --> 00:13:48,617
We see this reflected in hundreds of submissions

47
00:13:48,617 --> 00:13:50,239
we receive from all over the world for IGF.

48
00:13:50,239 --> 00:13:53,481
And indie showcases popping up in Johannesburg,

49
00:13:53,481 --> 00:13:57,744
to Saudi Arabia, to China, to everywhere in between.

50
00:13:57,744 --> 00:14:00,266
The ability to share and create your stories,

51
00:14:00,266 --> 00:14:02,188
and experience the stories of others,

52
00:14:02,188 --> 00:14:03,629
is what makes games so powerful.

53
00:14:05,455 --> 00:14:08,437
As independent developers, you have the creative freedom,

54
00:14:08,437 --> 00:14:11,358
an entire universe of possibilities at your fingertips,

55
00:14:11,358 --> 00:14:13,039
a kind of virtual world, if you will,

56
00:14:13,039 --> 00:14:15,780
that can express billions of stories

57
00:14:15,780 --> 00:14:19,182
experienced by each player in wholly unique ways.

58
00:14:19,182 --> 00:14:21,223
This year's nominees prove that there's wonderful work

59
00:14:21,223 --> 00:14:24,104
already being done.

60
00:14:24,104 --> 00:14:26,566
The next step is to open the doors to more communities,

61
00:14:26,566 --> 00:14:29,287
to create more opportunities for more diversity,

62
00:14:29,287 --> 00:14:31,028
and not just of gender or race,

63
00:14:31,028 --> 00:14:33,649
but of economic backgrounds, religion, sexuality,

64
00:14:33,649 --> 00:14:34,810
and diversity of thought.

65
00:14:35,838 --> 00:14:38,981
This is accomplished through mentorship, access to funding,

66
00:14:38,981 --> 00:14:41,544
room for failure, and cushioning of risk

67
00:14:41,544 --> 00:14:44,228
by fostering individuals and supporting content that might

68
00:14:44,228 --> 00:14:46,150
not appeal to conventional wisdom.

69
00:14:46,150 --> 00:14:49,514
The narrative is that there isn't an audience for this work.

70
00:14:49,514 --> 00:14:52,778
Well, maybe there's no audience because there's no content.

71
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:54,580
It's time to prove that we can do it.

72
00:15:04,190 --> 00:15:07,833
So thanks again to everyone in this room for inspiring those around you,

73
00:15:07,833 --> 00:15:13,218
for creating possibilities, and building new and wonderful worlds for us to explore.

74
00:15:13,218 --> 00:15:17,261
And now, I'm very happy to introduce the chair of the FreePlay Independent Games Festival,

75
00:15:17,261 --> 00:15:22,986
co-founder of League of Geeks, and one of Australia's finest exports since Tim Tams,

76
00:15:22,986 --> 00:15:23,747
Trent Custers.

77
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:46,988
Thanks Kelly. Wow. Australia's finest export. Cop that, Thor. Okay. G'day everyone. There

78
00:15:46,988 --> 00:15:53,774
you are. That's literally the only Australian joke you're going to get. So, alright. Twenty

79
00:15:53,774 --> 00:16:00,420
years. Twenty years of celebrating indie games. Independent games. I mean I think that deserves

80
00:16:00,420 --> 00:16:01,861
another round of applause.

81
00:16:11,275 --> 00:16:13,997
And you know what, I think that's actually a great note

82
00:16:13,997 --> 00:16:16,179
to start the show on, that it's the 20th annual IGF Awards.

83
00:16:16,179 --> 00:16:20,142
As you know, we've been supporting the IGFs

84
00:16:20,142 --> 00:16:23,805
with updates, new content, bug fixes,

85
00:16:23,805 --> 00:16:26,267
for what, I think 20 years now since launch?

86
00:16:26,267 --> 00:16:30,670
And well, with the rising costs of award show development,

87
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:31,331
you all know how it is,

88
00:16:31,331 --> 00:16:33,693
we're gonna be changing things up a bit this year.

89
00:16:33,693 --> 00:16:36,375
This year, instead of giving out IGF Awards

90
00:16:36,375 --> 00:16:37,896
just the old-fashioned way,

91
00:16:39,423 --> 00:16:43,285
Every finalist will receive a special IGF chest.

92
00:16:43,285 --> 00:16:43,605
No, true story.

93
00:16:43,605 --> 00:16:56,651
Inside that chest is your chance, finalists, to win your IGF award for your category.

94
00:16:56,651 --> 00:17:03,294
I mean, hey, seriously, I mean, it's a good deal.

95
00:17:03,294 --> 00:17:04,255
And I mean, don't fret.

96
00:17:05,528 --> 00:17:09,890
If you come up empty, you can always purchase additional chests from the in-show store.

97
00:17:09,890 --> 00:17:16,153
It's totally fine.

98
00:17:16,153 --> 00:17:19,334
There are a few, I can see, yeah, alright, I can see a few faces in the audience.

99
00:17:19,334 --> 00:17:26,697
Look, I know what you're thinking. The IGFs, pay to win now.

100
00:17:26,697 --> 00:17:28,698
Not the case. Nope, not the case.

101
00:17:28,698 --> 00:17:33,600
In fact, if you are the type of show attendee who doesn't want to spend any money purchasing additional chests,

102
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:35,021
you can always purchase additional chests.

103
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:38,262
you can actually earn them in-game.

104
00:17:38,262 --> 00:17:40,484
True, it's true.

105
00:17:40,484 --> 00:17:43,086
Game development, that is.

106
00:17:43,086 --> 00:17:44,167
Just another

107
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:47,289
three to five years slaving away with your

108
00:17:47,289 --> 00:17:53,495
team and who knows, maybe we'll give you another one.

109
00:17:53,495 --> 00:17:54,996
Alright, welcome to the 20th

110
00:17:54,996 --> 00:17:55,636
annual IGF Awards.

111
00:17:55,636 --> 00:17:56,597
Let's get this show on the road.

112
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:56,958
Thank you.

113
00:17:59,866 --> 00:18:02,947
I just tried to introduce myself over your applause, which I don't think is probably

114
00:18:02,947 --> 00:18:04,428
going to work out for me.

115
00:18:04,428 --> 00:18:09,130
I'm Trent Custers of League of Geeks, and I'll be your host for this evening.

116
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,272
And of course, don't worry, the IJF Awards are going to be the same as always, rigged

117
00:18:13,272 --> 00:18:14,213
by the Indie Illuminati!

118
00:18:16,623 --> 00:18:24,586
Yeah, that's it. Those people who cheered are the Illuminati, so you know, just keep your eyes out.

119
00:18:24,586 --> 00:18:30,167
Seriously though, you may not believe me, what with an Aussie host up here and all,

120
00:18:30,167 --> 00:18:35,809
but this award show is a real deal. It's some serious business. I mean, look at the line-up tonight, folks.

121
00:18:35,809 --> 00:18:38,510
What an absolutely fabulous array of games we have for you this evening.

122
00:18:38,510 --> 00:18:40,611
Yeah, that's definitely... Yeah, reason for applause.

123
00:18:44,879 --> 00:18:48,522
Barber is You is up for four awards tonight.

124
00:18:48,522 --> 00:18:48,782
Four awards.

125
00:18:48,782 --> 00:18:48,862
Yeah.

126
00:18:48,862 --> 00:18:49,082
Yeah.

127
00:18:49,082 --> 00:18:49,222
Yeah.

128
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:50,363
Yeah.

129
00:18:50,363 --> 00:18:50,964
Yeah.

130
00:18:50,964 --> 00:18:53,886
Yeah.

131
00:18:53,886 --> 00:18:57,289
Absolutely phenomenal effort for a student game.

132
00:18:57,289 --> 00:18:59,991
And of course a terrifying reminder of the slow

133
00:18:59,991 --> 00:19:02,032
but certain march of time for the rest of us.

134
00:19:02,032 --> 00:19:04,454
Getting over it with Bennett Foddy,

135
00:19:04,454 --> 00:19:05,755
up for three awards tonight.

136
00:19:05,755 --> 00:19:07,957
Give it up for Bennett everybody.

137
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:08,377
Yeah.

138
00:19:08,377 --> 00:19:10,679
Yeah.

139
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:10,839
Yeah.

140
00:19:10,839 --> 00:19:12,260
I'll tell you what.

141
00:19:14,059 --> 00:19:17,280
By a fellow Australian too, but he's now living in New York.

142
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:22,021
I mean, you'd have to leave Australia to get away with putting your fucking name in the title.

143
00:19:22,021 --> 00:19:25,081
Am I right, Bennett?

144
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:32,543
No, not many people know this, but Bennett was actually the bassist in the huge Grammy-nominated electronic band Cut Copy.

145
00:19:32,543 --> 00:19:39,104
And then, yeah, and then went on to be a professor or something at Oxford.

146
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:43,153
So, rock star, academic luminary, world famous game designer.

147
00:19:43,153 --> 00:19:46,055
I don't know about you, but it's pretty hard

148
00:19:46,055 --> 00:19:48,657
seeing people achieve your dreams

149
00:19:48,657 --> 00:19:50,499
without watching them nail it in reverse.

150
00:19:50,499 --> 00:19:54,102
We're all stuck in 2018 and Bennett's out here

151
00:19:54,102 --> 00:19:55,943
Mario Kart mirror-moding life.

152
00:19:55,943 --> 00:19:58,545
On you Bennett, well done.

153
00:19:58,545 --> 00:20:07,613
Where the Water Tastes Like Wine,

154
00:20:07,613 --> 00:20:09,754
another incredible game, right?

155
00:20:10,891 --> 00:20:14,112
Yeah? Fantastic.

156
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:18,174
Now, I'm not sure if any of you have seen it or played it,

157
00:20:18,174 --> 00:20:22,275
but if you have, you will have no doubt known and noticed

158
00:20:22,275 --> 00:20:25,136
that Sting actually does VO in the game.

159
00:20:25,136 --> 00:20:25,957
That's right, the Sting.

160
00:20:25,957 --> 00:20:28,398
Someone convinced Sting to do VO in a video game,

161
00:20:28,398 --> 00:20:30,378
which tells us one thing.

162
00:20:30,378 --> 00:20:34,620
Sting has no idea what video games are.

163
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,321
Cuphead, beautiful game, absolutely fantastic,

164
00:20:38,321 --> 00:20:38,761
flawless, beautiful.

165
00:20:41,427 --> 00:20:47,990
Well, but, I mean, that's not to say that any of the other excellence in visual arts or finalists should be concerned.

166
00:20:47,990 --> 00:20:51,632
I mean, you're all, you're all absolutely excellent. You look fantastic.

167
00:20:51,632 --> 00:20:56,094
And besides, you've, let's be realistic, you've got bigger things to worry about this year.

168
00:20:56,094 --> 00:20:58,035
A game with Stick Art is up for grand prize.

169
00:20:58,035 --> 00:21:00,936
West of Loathing, everybody.

170
00:21:00,936 --> 00:21:03,657
It's true.

171
00:21:03,657 --> 00:21:03,937
Stick Art.

172
00:21:03,937 --> 00:21:06,358
Up there, Seamus McNally.

173
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:10,841
And it's another thing that I noticed this year when I was going through the awards,

174
00:21:10,841 --> 00:21:14,802
it's great to see a bunch of follow-up finalists who've been here before.

175
00:21:14,802 --> 00:21:16,723
They've been finalists in years previous.

176
00:21:16,723 --> 00:21:17,703
It's fantastic.

177
00:21:17,703 --> 00:21:20,984
Tacoma from Fulbright, who's... Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fantastic, right?

178
00:21:20,984 --> 00:21:25,245
**Applause**

179
00:21:25,245 --> 00:21:30,227
Tacoma's level designer, Nina Freeman, actually was the IGF awards host last year.

180
00:21:30,227 --> 00:21:32,567
So pretty stoked to find out I'll be a finalist next year.

181
00:21:32,567 --> 00:21:34,728
**Laughter**

182
00:21:34,728 --> 00:21:36,528
SubZep Games, into the breach.

183
00:21:38,462 --> 00:21:48,245
Back Again, or Space Crack 2 as it's known to the DEA, and of course Tooth and Tail from

184
00:21:48,245 --> 00:21:57,248
Pocket Watch Games, which we all know is the second best furry game ever made.

185
00:21:58,877 --> 00:22:00,599
True story, true story.

186
00:22:00,599 --> 00:22:03,001
Seriously though, it's great to have you all back.

187
00:22:03,001 --> 00:22:05,323
All the finalists that have returned this year,

188
00:22:05,323 --> 00:22:05,843
nominated again.

189
00:22:05,843 --> 00:22:08,566
I mean, it's incredibly important to us Indies

190
00:22:08,566 --> 00:22:11,068
to know that success can be repeated.

191
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,510
And that if we're successful enough,

192
00:22:13,510 --> 00:22:14,711
we can stop making games altogether.

193
00:22:14,711 --> 00:22:15,011
Like Rami.

194
00:22:15,011 --> 00:22:15,572
Aw.

195
00:22:15,572 --> 00:22:16,412
Aw.

196
00:22:16,412 --> 00:22:16,613
Aw.

197
00:22:16,613 --> 00:22:16,933
Aw.

198
00:22:16,933 --> 00:22:17,073
Aw.

199
00:22:17,073 --> 00:22:17,113
Aw.

200
00:22:17,113 --> 00:22:17,293
Aw.

201
00:22:17,293 --> 00:22:23,879
Congratulations, Rami.

202
00:22:23,879 --> 00:22:26,901
All right, all right, let's get this show on the road.

203
00:22:28,979 --> 00:22:30,820
Who am I?

204
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:32,180
I'm horrendously overscoped.

205
00:22:32,180 --> 00:22:37,062
Three out of four of my team members did absolutely nothing.

206
00:22:37,062 --> 00:22:43,825
I've missed more deadlines than Spy Party.

207
00:22:43,825 --> 00:22:54,789
Well I can tell you that it's none of these titles because these are the finalists for

208
00:22:54,789 --> 00:22:56,929
Best Student Game.

209
00:22:57,969 --> 00:23:00,471
Ben Calkins.

210
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:00,991
Sam Sweet.

211
00:23:00,991 --> 00:23:15,122
Don't Make Love, developed by Majese, Dario Dambra,

212
00:23:15,122 --> 00:23:18,225

213
00:23:23,647 --> 00:23:25,848
Penny Blue Finds a Clue.

214
00:23:25,848 --> 00:23:29,609

215
00:23:29,609 --> 00:23:32,251

216
00:23:32,251 --> 00:23:34,132
Jesse Hibbs.

217
00:23:34,132 --> 00:23:36,733
Leonardo Saikali.

218
00:23:36,733 --> 00:23:38,614
Garrett Huxtable.

219
00:23:38,614 --> 00:23:40,575
We Were Here.

220
00:23:40,575 --> 00:23:43,516
Developed by Total Mayhem Games.

221
00:23:43,516 --> 00:23:45,677
The Total Mayhem Games Team.

222
00:23:53,633 --> 00:23:57,035
Baba is You, developed by Hemphuli.

223
00:23:57,035 --> 00:24:05,558

224
00:24:05,558 --> 00:24:13,160
Guardian of the Gears, developed by DigiPen Team Studio 76.

225
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:16,661
Cameron Craig.

226
00:24:16,661 --> 00:24:19,182
Eduardo Gorenstein.

227
00:24:19,182 --> 00:24:21,123
Julie Gregg.

228
00:24:21,123 --> 00:24:22,383
Kaiden Nugent.

229
00:24:28,922 --> 00:24:30,686
Pretty decent.

230
00:24:30,686 --> 00:24:34,013
All right, and the winner of the IGF Award

231
00:24:34,013 --> 00:24:35,476
for Best Student Game is...

232
00:24:35,476 --> 00:24:40,185
Bubba is you.

233
00:25:02,962 --> 00:25:04,065
Do I have a joke here?

234
00:25:04,065 --> 00:25:06,589
Thank you.

235
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,631
Thank you.

236
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,756
It's pretty cool to be here.

237
00:25:11,435 --> 00:25:18,438
Well, I guess I have a couple of minutes to thank some people for getting here with Baba ISU.

238
00:25:18,438 --> 00:25:26,082
There are a lot of people to thank and I have a tendency of talking a bit too much, so I'll try to keep it short.

239
00:25:26,082 --> 00:25:30,784
There are four entities I'd like to thank specifically.

240
00:25:30,784 --> 00:25:35,967
First of them is Anni Leskela, my girlfriend, for supporting me throughout the development of Baba ISU.

241
00:25:35,967 --> 00:25:36,467
Thank you, Anni.

242
00:25:40,274 --> 00:25:48,437
The second one is Lucas Miller, who is actually at GDC this year, for teaching me how to use Lua,

243
00:25:48,437 --> 00:25:53,078
which has been super important in making Babes U.

244
00:25:53,078 --> 00:25:56,359
They are a programming genius in other ways as well, so thank you for that.

245
00:25:56,359 --> 00:26:01,961
Then there's Niklas Niflas Nygren, who is actually a finalist this year in IGF as well.

246
00:26:03,973 --> 00:26:07,176
for teaching me how to use some programs

247
00:26:07,176 --> 00:26:11,521
and how to keep working when it's very hard to stay motivated.

248
00:26:11,521 --> 00:26:17,347
And finally, I'd like to thank the Nordic Game Jam community

249
00:26:17,347 --> 00:26:20,150
for creating amazing events, without which

250
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,271
Babaisju wouldn't be here.

251
00:26:27,456 --> 00:26:30,963
So I guess it's a good time to start making those like,

252
00:26:30,963 --> 00:26:33,106
bye-bye, Swin jokes.

253
00:26:33,106 --> 00:26:36,212
Let's keep doing that throughout the night.

254
00:26:36,212 --> 00:26:36,793
I don't know, whatever.

255
00:26:36,793 --> 00:26:37,714
Thank you.

256
00:26:49,569 --> 00:26:55,653
A sure sign of the maturation of the indie games community is no doubt the level of quality

257
00:26:55,653 --> 00:27:00,156
and polish that the presentation of our games now exhibit.

258
00:27:00,156 --> 00:27:04,959
In fact, indie games are beginning to look so good that it's not uncommon to see comments

259
00:27:04,959 --> 00:27:08,302
like, fuck you EA, on the Steam reviews of indie games.

260
00:27:08,302 --> 00:27:17,848
I mean, what's better than some internet slug mistaking you for an army of publisher-financed

261
00:27:17,848 --> 00:27:18,909
artists, am I right?

262
00:27:19,461 --> 00:27:20,741
I think we've made it, folks.

263
00:27:20,741 --> 00:27:24,982
And so with that, the finalists for Excellence in Visual Art are…

264
00:27:24,982 --> 00:27:28,483

265

Yaromir Plaki.

292
00:28:51,126 --> 00:29:04,436
All right, some pretty games, okay.

293
00:29:04,436 --> 00:29:07,739
And the winner for the IGF Award

294
00:29:07,739 --> 00:29:12,602
for Excellence in Visual Art is

295
00:29:12,602 --> 00:29:13,043
Chuchill.

296
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,941
This is crazy.

297
00:29:42,941 --> 00:29:45,782
Unbelievable.

298
00:29:45,782 --> 00:29:46,262
Wow.

299
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:48,583
I think we should thank

300
00:29:48,583 --> 00:29:50,203
mostly...

301
00:29:50,203 --> 00:29:50,963
Everyone.

302
00:29:50,963 --> 00:29:51,664
Everyone.

303
00:29:51,664 --> 00:29:55,245
Thank you. But mostly to

304
00:29:55,245 --> 00:29:57,506
our colleague Jara Plachy,

305
00:29:57,506 --> 00:30:00,447
who is the main creator of this game,

306
00:30:00,447 --> 00:30:01,607
who designed it,

307
00:30:01,607 --> 00:30:04,168
made all the animations

308
00:30:04,168 --> 00:30:04,788
and art.

309
00:30:04,788 --> 00:30:07,329
And the game design as well.

310
00:30:08,329 --> 00:30:15,140
who can't be here tonight with us because he's with his wife and their newborn son.

311
00:30:15,140 --> 00:30:20,828
Thanks to him. Thank you. Thank you so much.

312
00:30:30,239 --> 00:30:32,100
So back at Log HQ in Melbourne, our studio,

313
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:34,921
we've got things pretty much on lockdown.

314
00:30:34,921 --> 00:30:35,921
We run a tight ship.

315
00:30:35,921 --> 00:30:39,963
But our producer, Woody, has a post-it note,

316
00:30:39,963 --> 00:30:43,464
very important post-it note, stuck to his desk.

317
00:30:43,464 --> 00:30:47,646
And that post-it note reads, don't forget audio.

318
00:30:47,646 --> 00:30:51,407
The following games are from developers

319
00:30:51,407 --> 00:30:54,188
who did the literal opposite of forgetting about audio.

320
00:30:54,188 --> 00:30:57,209
Our nominees for excellence in audio are

321
00:30:59,423 --> 00:31:03,806
Excellence in audio.

328
00:31:18,233 --> 00:31:18,373

340
00:32:13,631 --> 00:32:14,171

And the award for Excellence in Audio goes to...

344
00:32:44,257 --> 00:32:45,438
Ernog Unlimited.

345
00:33:19,813 --> 00:33:24,836
Oh, so neither of us are Nicholas.

346
00:33:24,836 --> 00:33:27,638
Uh, so, uh, actually he couldn't make it.

347
00:33:27,638 --> 00:33:31,541
He wanted me to tell everyone that he's really sorry.

348
00:33:31,541 --> 00:33:34,623
Uh, but he has a very strong fear of flying.

349
00:33:34,623 --> 00:33:37,305
So we are coming up to accept this for him.

350
00:33:37,305 --> 00:33:40,727
And I'm shaking like crazy because this is the most nervous I think

351
00:33:40,727 --> 00:33:41,408
I've been in like 20 years.

352
00:33:41,408 --> 00:33:46,291
Uh, but, uh, he wanted me to thank all the people that they just mentioned,

353
00:33:46,291 --> 00:33:48,273
but I want to say who is hot dog.

354
00:33:49,530 --> 00:33:51,351
The mystery of Hot Dog.

355
00:33:51,351 --> 00:33:54,013
The mystery of the Urnog.

356
00:33:54,013 --> 00:33:55,494
Hot Dog is Nicholas's dog,

357
00:33:55,494 --> 00:33:57,756
who does all the voices for the dogs in the game.

358
00:33:57,756 --> 00:33:59,477
That's the voice actor of Urnog.

359
00:33:59,477 --> 00:34:00,178
Yeah, but thank you everyone.

360
00:34:00,178 --> 00:34:08,424
Thank you for everybody who's in this industry,

361
00:34:08,424 --> 00:34:11,446
who's doing these indie games, who's taking risks.

362
00:34:11,446 --> 00:34:12,847
Ah, I wanna cry right now.

363
00:34:12,847 --> 00:34:16,049
I'm just so, like everybody here is so amazing.

364
00:34:16,049 --> 00:34:16,670
It's like, you know.

365
00:34:17,545 --> 00:34:22,829
Yeah, everybody should be on the stage.

366
00:34:22,829 --> 00:34:35,438
Everybody should be getting an award.

367
00:34:35,438 --> 00:34:40,442
So, sorry, I'm getting emotional.

368
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:41,483
Thank you.

369
00:34:41,483 --> 00:34:43,925
Thank you.

370
00:34:44,590 --> 00:34:50,734
You may remember him from his legendary mountain ascent in 2017's Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

371
00:34:50,734 --> 00:34:51,514
But where is he now?

372
00:34:51,514 --> 00:34:54,416
We sent a reporter to get the answers.

373
00:34:54,416 --> 00:34:59,279
Over to you, Lindsay. On the scene with the story. Mimosas at lunch.

374
00:34:59,279 --> 00:34:59,619
Can't wait.

375
00:34:59,619 --> 00:35:03,982
Yeah, ever since I got over it with Bennett Foddy, things have been great.

376
00:35:03,982 --> 00:35:05,363
I get recognized on the street.

377
00:35:05,363 --> 00:35:07,845
But, you know, I'm still just a normal guy.

378
00:35:07,845 --> 00:35:13,308
I put my cauldron on one leg at a time, just like everyone else.

379
00:35:13,709 --> 00:35:17,251
I live in a really nice neighborhood, you know, Seymour loves it, my dog.

380
00:35:17,251 --> 00:35:20,953
I try to stay busy, you know, I got some hobbies.

381
00:35:20,953 --> 00:35:27,397
I like to bake and I'm getting really good at badminton, if I do say so myself.

382
00:35:27,397 --> 00:35:32,741
And yeah, I just recently got into painting, which has been really good for me.

383
00:35:32,741 --> 00:35:34,041
Yeah, it's been really positive.

384
00:35:34,041 --> 00:35:37,524
So we've heard there have been some changes in your life.

385
00:35:37,524 --> 00:35:39,805
Would you like to talk about that?

386
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:40,025
Yeah.

387
00:35:41,155 --> 00:35:43,576
Yeah, my wife left a couple months ago.

388
00:35:43,576 --> 00:35:48,077
Um, you know, it's been hard, but I'm trying to stay positive.

389
00:35:48,077 --> 00:35:52,359
I just, uh, recently made a Tinder profile.

390
00:35:52,359 --> 00:35:54,660
So, you know, I'm getting out there.

391
00:35:54,660 --> 00:35:56,840
Ladies and gents, your man's available.

392
00:35:56,840 --> 00:35:59,981
Oh, is that from your time on the mountain?

393
00:35:59,981 --> 00:36:08,064
Yeah, yeah, I'm kind of nostalgic, you know, so I like to have that one on there.

394
00:36:08,064 --> 00:36:08,545
Oh, oh, Connor.

395
00:36:09,437 --> 00:36:13,579
I'm sorry, uh, I have to go after we get that. Sorry.

396
00:36:13,579 --> 00:36:13,639
Hey.

397
00:36:13,639 --> 00:36:16,240
Hey, I called twice. Where were you?

398
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,942
Sorry, I had my phone on silent. We were doing an interview thing.

399
00:36:19,942 --> 00:36:22,763
Did you forget you have Connor this weekend?

400
00:36:22,763 --> 00:36:23,964
No, I didn't forget. Okay.

401
00:36:23,964 --> 00:36:28,025
Well, he hasn't eaten lunch, so you'll need to feed him.

402
00:36:28,025 --> 00:36:28,426
Okay.

403
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:30,006
Here is his inhaler and his allergy list.

404
00:36:30,006 --> 00:36:34,708
I already have the allergy list on the fridge, Beth.

405
00:36:37,160 --> 00:36:42,863
Are you hungry, little buddy? Are you hungry?

406
00:36:42,863 --> 00:36:45,144
Yeah, you're hungry.

407
00:36:45,144 --> 00:36:48,747
Uh, I love being a dad, you know.

408
00:36:48,747 --> 00:36:53,529
He's so great. He's my little man.

409
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:57,512
Aren't you my little man? Are you ready?

410
00:36:57,512 --> 00:37:00,053
You ready for the airplane?

411
00:37:00,053 --> 00:37:02,415
So you're a single dad. You're currently unemployed.

412
00:37:02,415 --> 00:37:02,735
But you seem happy.

413
00:37:02,735 --> 00:37:04,176
I mean, once I got over it with Bennett Foddy,

414
00:37:04,176 --> 00:37:05,517
I kind of felt like I could get over anything.

415
00:37:05,517 --> 00:37:05,957
Woah! Is he okay?

416
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:06,417
He'll get over it.

417
00:37:08,581 --> 00:37:10,482
Riveting stuff. Thanks, Lens.

418
00:37:10,482 --> 00:37:17,184
Next up, Cuphead and Wife welcome their first child, but rumor has it he may be more mug than cup.

419
00:37:17,184 --> 00:37:17,504
Whoopsie!

420
00:37:17,504 --> 00:37:18,164
Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

421
00:37:18,164 --> 00:37:20,325
Totally not his kid, though.

422
00:37:20,325 --> 00:37:22,085
Yeah, now it looks like a complete mug.

423
00:37:22,085 --> 00:37:22,845
Family's destroyed.

424
00:37:22,845 --> 00:37:23,626
Bloodline's tainted.

425
00:37:23,626 --> 00:37:24,026
It's over. 🎵

426
00:37:24,026 --> 00:37:36,370
🎵 Please welcome to the stage, Alt-Control GDC co-founder, John Polson.

427
00:37:48,515 --> 00:37:50,957
Hey everyone, good evening.

428
00:37:50,957 --> 00:37:53,418
The Alternative Controller Exhibit, Alt-Control GDC,

429
00:37:53,418 --> 00:37:55,740
has hit its first major anniversary,

430
00:37:55,740 --> 00:37:57,882
now five years and going strong

431
00:37:57,882 --> 00:38:01,284
with over 100 amazing submissions this year.

432
00:38:01,284 --> 00:38:04,286
I'm so fortunate to get to organize Alt-Control GDC

433
00:38:04,286 --> 00:38:05,607
and see it grow every year.

434
00:38:06,668 --> 00:38:12,959
I'm happy to also see all the cardboard, hardwired, and otherwise DIY controller experiments pop

435
00:38:12,959 --> 00:38:19,009
up inside and outside of the pavilion on the GDC show floor, evidence that the game industry

436
00:38:19,009 --> 00:38:20,993
is excited to change the way we play.

437
00:38:22,122 --> 00:38:26,044
Only at Alt Control GDC can you experience true claustrophobia

438
00:38:26,044 --> 00:38:29,807
in a game played in a grave, interact as either audience

439
00:38:29,807 --> 00:38:31,948
or performer in a puppet show,

440
00:38:31,948 --> 00:38:34,750
or embrace your inner rainbow unicorn and strap

441
00:38:34,750 --> 00:38:37,711
on a horn while surviving a mundane office job.

442
00:38:37,711 --> 00:38:41,974
2018's unique award will shine in its own way,

443
00:38:41,974 --> 00:38:44,075
handcrafted by Jerry Bellick,

444
00:38:44,075 --> 00:38:46,516
a multi-year Alt Control GDC alum.

445
00:38:46,516 --> 00:38:47,797
Give it up for Jerry.

446
00:38:47,797 --> 00:38:51,199
That is the award.

447
00:38:55,748 --> 00:39:02,494
Jerry who, yes, as you guys may know is also the creator of the Chusatron.

448
00:39:02,494 --> 00:39:15,907

the winner of the Alt Control GDC Award, Puppet Pandemonium.

456
00:40:45,474 --> 00:40:45,934
Thank you.

457
00:40:45,934 --> 00:40:46,315
Thank you.

458
00:40:46,315 --> 00:40:47,255
This is amazing.

459
00:40:47,255 --> 00:40:51,017
I've made a little list just in case so I don't forget anyone.

460
00:40:51,017 --> 00:40:51,297
Okay.

461
00:40:51,297 --> 00:40:53,378
Thank you.

462
00:40:53,378 --> 00:40:53,958
Thank you to my team.

463
00:40:53,958 --> 00:41:04,484
Thank you GDC and the all control judges obviously and IGF.

464
00:41:04,484 --> 00:41:06,225
This is amazing.

465
00:41:06,225 --> 00:41:10,667
Thank you to my mom for helping me learn how to sew through Skype, which is cool.

466
00:41:11,615 --> 00:41:14,736
Thank you to my boss for letting us put this thing together in his garage.

467
00:41:14,736 --> 00:41:16,236
That was really nice.

468
00:41:16,236 --> 00:41:17,316
Let's see, John, thank you as well.

469
00:41:17,316 --> 00:41:22,518
And all the other fantastic, inspiring pieces that make us all play these games and stuff.

470
00:41:22,518 --> 00:41:25,578
And all the performers who played, because that was really scary.

471
00:41:25,578 --> 00:41:26,819
Do you want to say anything?

472
00:41:26,819 --> 00:41:34,080
I would like to thank Terrence for dragging us all together from some VR hackathon and

473
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:38,902
a Halloween party to just make this crazy idea real.

474
00:41:38,902 --> 00:41:39,362
Yeah.

475
00:41:39,362 --> 00:41:40,142
Keep making...

476
00:41:57,494 --> 00:41:59,195
Thank you very much.

477
00:41:59,195 --> 00:42:03,557
Game design is too often the most illustrious and celebrated role in game development.

478
00:42:03,557 --> 00:42:05,418
It's true.

479
00:42:05,418 --> 00:42:07,339
It's very true.

480
00:42:07,339 --> 00:42:08,500
I'm a game designer, I can say that.

481
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:13,146
Just like a great soundtrack, great game design,

482
00:42:13,146 --> 00:42:14,427
you don't notice.

483
00:42:14,427 --> 00:42:18,650
Great game design takes a step into the background

484
00:42:18,650 --> 00:42:21,632
and permits the player to become immersed

485
00:42:21,632 --> 00:42:22,993
in the experiences we craft.

486
00:42:22,993 --> 00:42:27,417
Great game designers, whether sole visionaries

487
00:42:27,417 --> 00:42:30,559
or dedicated teams, are masters of the unseen,

488
00:42:30,559 --> 00:42:33,942
mavens of illusion.

489
00:42:33,942 --> 00:42:37,044
But most importantly, game designers

490
00:42:37,044 --> 00:42:38,746
are the advocate of the player.

491
00:42:39,918 --> 00:42:45,842
And here are the nominees for Excellence in Design.

492
00:42:45,842 --> 00:42:48,724

Ricky Haggett.

505
00:43:25,842 --> 00:43:27,843

513
00:44:21,413 --> 00:44:24,454
All right, and the Excellence in Design award goes to...

514
00:44:24,454 --> 00:44:30,356
I've been trying to open these extra slow by the way.

515
00:44:30,356 --> 00:44:31,216
Baba is you.

516
00:44:49,170 --> 00:44:55,039
I kind of used everything I had to say in the first talk, so let's keep this short.

517
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:56,080
Thanks again.

518
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:00,086
I'm very surprised, and yeah.

519
00:45:00,086 --> 00:45:00,406
Thanks.

520
00:45:11,341 --> 00:45:16,526
I remember one of the first things that stuck with me when I entered the industry was a

521
00:45:16,526 --> 00:45:22,731
GDC talk that Clint Hocking had done in 2007 or something, where he talked about something

522
00:45:22,731 --> 00:45:27,175
a colleague said to him in response to some outlandish feature request he'd no doubt come

523
00:45:27,175 --> 00:45:27,936
up with.

524
00:45:27,936 --> 00:45:31,519
And that person said, dude, it's code.

525
00:45:31,519 --> 00:45:32,500
We can do anything.

526
00:45:34,150 --> 00:45:39,191
The Nuovo Award is a category reserved for a very special type of developers

527
00:45:39,191 --> 00:45:43,733
who take that notion far too literally.

528
00:45:43,733 --> 00:45:48,975

and an honour to celebrate these games and developers.

That's awesome.

563
00:48:05,662 --> 00:48:09,746
Alright, and the winner for the Nuova Award is...

564
00:48:09,746 --> 00:48:14,150
Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy.

565
00:48:48,843 --> 00:48:52,386
My wife's going to say, that's living in your office.

566
00:48:52,386 --> 00:48:58,190
Walking around the conference, I've

567
00:48:58,190 --> 00:49:00,752
just been struck by how many people

568
00:49:00,752 --> 00:49:04,195
I see who have really helped me a lot in the last 12 years.

569
00:49:04,195 --> 00:49:11,040
Just encouragement, critique, writing tools that I used,

570
00:49:11,040 --> 00:49:14,243
creating online spaces that I needed.

571
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,224
I think without Derek Yu's website,

572
00:49:16,224 --> 00:49:18,366
I just honestly would never have gotten started.

573
00:49:19,462 --> 00:49:19,602
Yeah.

574
00:49:19,602 --> 00:49:28,787
And, you know, I think that's, like, that's the only thing that makes indie games possible,

575
00:49:28,787 --> 00:49:32,430
is that we're all helping each other all the time.

576
00:49:32,430 --> 00:49:36,152
And that's what I'm going to think about every time I look at this somewhere in my office.

577
00:49:47,078 --> 00:49:51,602
Trust the Australian to try and walk off the front of the stage, of course.

578
00:49:51,602 --> 00:49:56,285
Alright, now we so often talk about story in games,

579
00:49:56,285 --> 00:50:03,770
but narrative is the very framework of a game's storytelling potential.

580
00:50:03,770 --> 00:50:06,051
Narrative is the architecture of the story,

581
00:50:06,051 --> 00:50:09,113
the systems that communicate story,

582
00:50:09,113 --> 00:50:13,976
the delivery method for connecting with the minds and hearts of our players.

583
00:50:15,378 --> 00:50:18,239
It is perhaps one of the most specific

584
00:50:18,239 --> 00:50:21,461
and exclusive elements that our medium

585
00:50:21,461 --> 00:50:23,962
can offer above any other.

586
00:50:23,962 --> 00:50:26,524
And so it's with great pleasure

587
00:50:26,524 --> 00:50:28,705
that I present to you this year's finalists

588
00:50:28,705 --> 00:50:31,186

Andy Schatz, Alex Kane, Dexter Friedman, Andy Nguyen.

603
00:52:01,148 --> 00:52:04,210
And the Excellence in Narrative Award goes to

604
00:52:04,210 --> 00:52:05,091
Night in the Woods.

605
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:59,969
Hold on, I'm going to tweet about this real quick.

606
00:52:59,969 --> 00:53:00,149
No.

607
00:53:00,149 --> 00:53:01,009
Thank you.

608
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:03,110
I don't think, I wasn't expecting this.

609
00:53:03,110 --> 00:53:05,311
I just told every single person I met,

610
00:53:05,311 --> 00:53:07,332
I'm like, we're not going to win this.

611
00:53:07,332 --> 00:53:09,013
This, oh no, man, we're just going to watch someone else

612
00:53:09,013 --> 00:53:11,333
walk up there, but thank you.

613
00:53:11,333 --> 00:53:12,734
This was the first game we ever worked on.

614
00:53:12,734 --> 00:53:17,156
Thanks to Alec for saying, hey, you guys

615
00:53:17,156 --> 00:53:20,557
should just go with the story that you want

616
00:53:20,557 --> 00:53:22,358
to go with on trusting us.

617
00:53:22,698 --> 00:53:26,985
with that. It was obviously a group effort but that was just a huge vote of confidence in

618
00:53:26,985 --> 00:53:32,795
faith so thank you. This goes out to everyone who doesn't get to tell their stories in games

619
00:53:32,795 --> 00:53:37,142
that end up on big screens here.

620
00:53:38,272 --> 00:53:42,734
Like, five years ago or four years ago, just the thought of us ever being able to tell

621
00:53:42,734 --> 00:53:46,455
the kind of story that we wanted to tell in a video game, let alone win an award for it,

622
00:53:46,455 --> 00:53:47,416
is insane.

623
00:53:47,416 --> 00:53:48,536
So just thank you.

624
00:53:48,536 --> 00:53:49,276
Thanks a lot.

625
00:53:49,276 --> 00:53:49,837
That's it.

626
00:53:49,837 --> 00:53:51,297
Do you want to say something?

627
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:51,777
Thank you.

628
00:53:51,777 --> 00:53:52,078
Thank you.

629
00:53:52,078 --> 00:53:52,238
Thank you.

630
00:53:52,238 --> 00:53:52,438
Thank you.

631
00:53:52,438 --> 00:53:52,758
Thank you.

632
00:53:52,758 --> 00:53:52,998
Thank you.

633
00:53:52,998 --> 00:53:53,158
Thank you.

634
00:53:53,158 --> 00:53:53,318
Thank you.

635
00:53:53,318 --> 00:53:53,478
Thank you.

636
00:53:53,478 --> 00:53:53,638
Thank you.

637
00:53:53,638 --> 00:53:53,798
Thank you.

638
00:53:53,798 --> 00:53:53,978
Thank you.

639
00:53:53,978 --> 00:53:54,218
Thank you.

640
00:54:10,703 --> 00:54:11,383
Ash, what's playing?

641
00:54:11,383 --> 00:54:21,128
Bye bye, Jean. ♪

642
00:54:21,128 --> 00:54:21,968
Oh. ♪

643

Ahhh. ♪ ♪ ♪

644
00:55:08,494 --> 00:55:15,900

Wife?

646
00:55:31,515 --> 00:55:44,140
I'm bored.

647
00:56:02,370 --> 00:56:02,614
you

648
00:56:53,907 --> 00:57:00,893
Woo! Free sale!

649
00:57:00,893 --> 00:57:04,275
Okay.

650
00:57:10,655 --> 00:57:13,576
Please give a warm welcome to Chris Charla,

651
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:17,338
Director of ID at Xbox, and Sarah Bond,

652
00:57:17,338 --> 00:57:20,619
General Manager, Xbox Third-Party Publishing,

653
00:57:20,619 --> 00:57:24,201
who will be presenting the ID at Xbox Gaming

654
00:57:24,201 --> 00:57:25,422
for Everyone Award.

655
00:57:35,762 --> 00:57:36,262
Hey everyone.

656
00:57:36,262 --> 00:57:37,863
Hey everybody.

657
00:57:37,863 --> 00:57:41,966
So one of the raddest things about the independent development community is just the diversity

658
00:57:41,966 --> 00:57:43,567
in games that folks are working on.

659
00:57:43,567 --> 00:57:48,570
So we always like to take a little time during the IGF to put a spotlight on a group that's

660
00:57:48,570 --> 00:57:50,051
helping bringing gaming to everyone.

661
00:57:51,300 --> 00:57:53,723
But that's not just about the games that you guys make.

662
00:57:53,723 --> 00:57:56,766
It's also about making sure that everyone can play.

663
00:57:56,766 --> 00:58:00,890
There are multiple great groups focusing on this

664
00:58:00,890 --> 00:58:04,233
in different ways, and they're all super cool.

665
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:06,615
Tonight, we want to showcase one of them,

666
00:58:06,615 --> 00:58:09,718
our friends at Special Effect.

667
00:58:12,442 --> 00:58:22,008
Before we visited Special Effects, we've always been a huge gaming family and gaming is something I wanted all my children to be able to have the opportunity to do.

668
00:58:22,008 --> 00:58:29,552
Chase has got a severe form of cerebral palsy and he has dystonia which means he can't fully control his body very well.

669
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:34,736
Even trying to get Chase to push a button is really difficult to do because he just doesn't have the fine motor skills to do it.

670
00:58:34,736 --> 00:58:38,878
But he really loved gaming and you could see that he wanted to do more.

671
00:58:39,318 --> 00:58:48,182
So we went up to the gaming room in Oxford and throughout the day we tried lots of different pieces of equipment, lots of different games until we found out what worked best for Chase.

672
00:58:48,182 --> 00:58:53,604
As a parent it's made so much difference for Chase being able to access video games.

673
00:58:53,604 --> 00:58:59,207
I was really sad that I thought he was never really going to be able to join in and do those things on his own.

674
00:59:00,687 --> 00:59:05,588
Particularly to disabled people, I think games are really important because, you know,

675
00:59:05,588 --> 00:59:09,509
somebody who's able-bodied can go out, they can play golf, they can go and drive a car,

676
00:59:09,509 --> 00:59:11,670
they can do almost anything in real life.

677
00:59:11,670 --> 00:59:15,171
Tristan's going to have those same opportunities.

678
00:59:15,171 --> 00:59:19,051
So being able to sit down and put on a game means that it creates a level playing field.

679
00:59:19,051 --> 00:59:24,873
He can do an activity that he probably wouldn't be able to do in normal day-to-day life.

680
00:59:24,873 --> 00:59:28,514
But even better, with gaming, he can play alongside someone who's able-bodied

681
00:59:28,514 --> 00:59:30,634
and it gives a real boost to his self-confidence, I think.

682
00:59:30,927 --> 00:59:31,969
That was good.

683
00:59:31,969 --> 00:59:32,469
Look at that.

684
00:59:32,469 --> 00:59:32,830
Thank you.

685
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,011
You're welcome.

686
00:59:34,011 --> 00:59:34,932
Thanks, guys.

687
00:59:34,932 --> 00:59:49,031
And please give a warm round of applause to Mick Donagan, the CEO of Special Effects.

688
01:00:09,165 --> 01:00:16,671
Yeah, thank you. Yeah, hi, I'm Mick Donegan, founder and CEO of SpecialEffect.

689
01:00:16,671 --> 01:00:22,516
As you can see, a charity that helps people with severe physical disabilities to play video games.

690
01:00:22,516 --> 01:00:29,581
Our base is in the UK, but we don't think of ourselves as just being UK-based.

691
01:00:29,581 --> 01:00:30,382
We're world-based.

692
01:00:30,382 --> 01:00:35,907
With video games, there are no borders or boundaries to the countries in which they're played.

693
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:42,045
The only boundaries are those within the games themselves, for those people who are unable

694
01:00:42,045 --> 01:00:43,965
to play them because of their disabilities.

695
01:00:43,965 --> 01:00:51,967
Special effect technicians, software designers, therapy staff work as a team to help severely

696
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:59,888
disabled individuals on a face-to-face basis in order to unlock those barriers and provide

697
01:00:59,888 --> 01:01:04,069
them with a customized setup that enables them to play the games they want to play at

698
01:01:04,069 --> 01:01:05,649
the highest possible level they can.

699
01:01:06,955 --> 01:01:13,597
As a result of our help, many of them can compete with and beat non-disabled gamers,

700
01:01:13,597 --> 01:01:16,777
sometimes even the professionals.

701
01:01:16,777 --> 01:01:24,039
The difference that this specialist's one-to-one support can make is literally life-transforming.

702
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:32,821
One user, a guy who hadn't been able to play his favourite game for 15 years, simply

703
01:01:32,821 --> 01:01:33,161
said,

704
01:01:33,161 --> 01:01:35,942
Thank you for giving me my life back.

705
01:01:39,099 --> 01:01:44,361
However, our one-to-one solutions don't just benefit individuals.

706
01:01:44,361 --> 01:01:49,443
The insight and detailed knowledge we gain from the one-to-one, lifelong assessment and

707
01:01:49,443 --> 01:01:54,444
support we provide puts us in a perfect position to share what we learn with both hardware

708
01:01:54,444 --> 01:02:00,786
and software developers worldwide, so that they have an opportunity to incorporate our

709
01:02:00,786 --> 01:02:01,146
ideas.

710
01:02:01,146 --> 01:02:06,628
Put simply, by implementing a feature that's worked successfully for just one individual,

711
01:02:07,189 --> 01:02:15,742
literally tens of thousands of disabled people with similar needs across the world can benefit too.

712
01:02:15,742 --> 01:02:22,253
I'm absolutely delighted and shocked to be honest to receive this award on behalf of SpecialEffect.

713
01:02:22,597 --> 01:02:27,721
However, I'd also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge and celebrate the work of all

714
01:02:27,721 --> 01:02:33,827
the individuals, organizations, and developers all over the world, not least here in the

715
01:02:33,827 --> 01:02:40,032
U.S., who so clearly understand the inclusivity and sheer joy that only access to video games

716
01:02:40,032 --> 01:02:45,898
can bring, and are working increasingly successfully to share this joy with as many disabled people

717
01:02:45,898 --> 01:02:47,860
as possible, whoever they are.

718
01:02:47,960 --> 01:02:52,162
wherever they are and whatever their disabilities.

719
01:02:52,162 --> 01:02:57,124
It's a real privilege for myself and my special effect colleagues

720
01:02:57,124 --> 01:03:00,987
to be members of what I firmly believe is a global movement

721
01:03:00,987 --> 01:03:02,607
to give a life of gaming to everyone.

722
01:03:02,607 --> 01:03:03,228
Thank you very much indeed.

723
01:03:19,981 --> 01:03:24,464
As developers, we showcase games all over the world,

724
01:03:24,464 --> 01:03:28,167
standing on convention booths for sometimes days on end,

725
01:03:28,167 --> 01:03:30,268
shaky shaky hands all the time,

726
01:03:30,268 --> 01:03:33,390
talking to fans, colleagues, hugging.

727
01:03:33,390 --> 01:03:34,491
We definitely hug too much.

728
01:03:34,491 --> 01:03:36,712
Yeah.

729
01:03:36,712 --> 01:03:40,815
And just like the rabid, unkillable viruses

730
01:03:40,815 --> 01:03:42,476
that sweep through game development studios

731
01:03:42,476 --> 01:03:43,757
the week after a convention's closed,

732
01:03:43,757 --> 01:03:47,900
this following game has swept through society

733
01:03:47,900 --> 01:03:48,921
and into our hearts.

734
01:03:50,302 --> 01:04:02,912
It gives me great pleasure to announce this year's recipient of the IGF Audience Award.

735
01:04:51,943 --> 01:04:55,890
Who talks? We weren't expecting this at all.

736
01:04:57,323 --> 01:05:05,428
This is amazing. Wow. I wrote something for the audio award actually, but because we weren't expecting to win this at all.

737
01:05:05,428 --> 01:05:07,429
Thank you so much. Holy shit.

738
01:05:07,429 --> 01:05:18,114
Celeste released just a few months ago, but in that time we've received such an overwhelmingly positive wave of feedback and love from fans

739
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:21,836
that have resonated with the game, its themes and

740
01:05:23,138 --> 01:05:27,142
Celeste is a game that so closely ties all those themes together through design, through

741
01:05:27,142 --> 01:05:29,385
writing, through characters and audio.

742
01:05:29,385 --> 01:05:32,488
It provides an optimistic approach to tackling its challenges.

743
01:05:32,488 --> 01:05:35,271
It says that it's okay to fail on your way to success.

744
01:05:35,271 --> 01:05:39,556
I relate to that a lot and I think it also shows in its reception.

745
01:05:40,488 --> 01:05:45,431
In these few months, I've personally received hundreds of emails from people that have identified

746
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:50,133
with its depictions and attitude towards depression and anxiety.

747
01:05:50,133 --> 01:05:54,875
I've had someone reach out to tell me that they decided to live because of the encouragement

748
01:05:54,875 --> 01:05:55,756
the game gave them.

749
01:05:55,756 --> 01:05:56,976
And that's no small thing.

750
01:05:56,976 --> 01:06:02,359
I just wanted to share that with all of you.

751
01:06:03,946 --> 01:06:10,234
Thank you so much for recognizing this whole game that was built from a lot of love, from

752
01:06:10,234 --> 01:06:10,995
a lot of people.

753
01:06:10,995 --> 01:06:16,361
Thanks to Matt, to Noel, Amora, Pedro, Kevin, Gabby, Sven, all of your contributions to

754
01:06:16,361 --> 01:06:18,243
something that I think is really, truly special.

755
01:06:36,852 --> 01:06:42,514
Please give a warm IGF welcome to the winner of last year's Seamus McNally Grand Prize

756
01:06:42,514 --> 01:06:44,435
Award, Brendan Chung.

757
01:06:44,435 --> 01:07:00,940
Whenever I play a game and it doesn't crash, it feels like a little miracle.

758
01:07:02,677 --> 01:07:07,300
How is this game running and not immediately getting crushed under the sheer weight of itself?

759
01:07:07,300 --> 01:07:16,904
How did you make this interesting, funny, beautiful thing with such little time and resources and support?

760
01:07:16,904 --> 01:07:20,206
Well, we all know how it feels to be small.

761
01:07:20,206 --> 01:07:24,088
And we all know how it feels to be vulnerable.

762
01:07:24,088 --> 01:07:25,329
And that is our strength.

763
01:07:25,329 --> 01:07:27,510
And that is what makes our work we do so special.

764
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:31,792
Here are the nominees for the Seamus McNally Grand Prize.

765
01:07:33,304 --> 01:07:36,186

768
01:07:45,472 --> 01:07:47,473
To live is to suffer.

769
01:07:47,473 --> 01:07:52,396
To survive is to find some meaning in the suffering.

770
01:07:52,396 --> 01:07:54,398
Night in the Woods.

771
01:07:54,398 --> 01:07:57,760

792
01:09:09,263 --> 01:09:12,349
And the IGF Seamus McNally Grand Prize winner is...

793
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:16,356
Night in the Woods.

794
01:09:53,236 --> 01:09:55,197
I promise I'm not tweeting, I'm just checking my notes.

795
01:09:55,197 --> 01:09:57,478
Wow, this is weird.

796
01:09:57,478 --> 01:10:02,220
I was here, I think, 11 years ago for Aquaria, so this is very unusual.

797
01:10:02,220 --> 01:10:04,181
I just want to say a couple things.

798
01:10:04,181 --> 01:10:10,404
Thanks to the amazingly talented and incredibly self-motivated team.

799
01:10:10,404 --> 01:10:16,567
I was super lucky to get a chance to work with such incredibly funny and awesome and caring people.

800
01:10:16,567 --> 01:10:22,050
And thank you to everyone in my life who believed that I wasn't a completely irredeemable piece of garbage.

801
01:10:22,790 --> 01:10:29,152
That especially includes my family, Greg and Debra, Eileen and Ian, and shout out to Bob Fenton,

802
01:10:29,152 --> 01:10:42,236
my therapist, a cerbic British man who, you know, called me on my bullshit, so thank you very much.

803
01:10:42,236 --> 01:10:43,036
Hey.

804
01:10:43,036 --> 01:10:47,158
So I'm Becca Saltzman and I'm part of Finji, who sort of has like helped shepherd this.

805
01:10:49,485 --> 01:10:52,987
I have a few thank yous, sort of like as a studio,

806
01:10:52,987 --> 01:10:54,528
that I need to send out.

807
01:10:54,528 --> 01:10:58,050
One is to our team at Sony, who, God bless them,

808
01:10:58,050 --> 01:11:00,191
stayed up all night before launch night.

809
01:11:00,191 --> 01:11:02,753
John, Elisa, and Matt, thank you very much.

810
01:11:02,753 --> 01:11:05,675
Also, our dev teams who helped us launch on Xbox and Switch.

811
01:11:05,675 --> 01:11:07,536
I managed to do this trash on my own

812
01:11:07,536 --> 01:11:10,758
with our porting studio in 22nd Century in Austin.

813
01:11:10,758 --> 01:11:13,219
That's, yeah.

814
01:11:13,219 --> 01:11:16,401
Joe, Tony, and Taylor, wow, thank you so much.

815
01:11:17,722 --> 01:11:20,703
A couple of shoutouts actually to Xbox and Nintendo.

816
01:11:20,703 --> 01:11:21,483
God bless you Wally.

817
01:11:21,483 --> 01:11:24,944
I don't know who you are, I'll meet you someday.

818
01:11:24,944 --> 01:11:26,145
Yep, there we go.

819
01:11:26,145 --> 01:11:31,466
And also Sarah and the assortment of people

820
01:11:31,466 --> 01:11:34,847
who answer third party panicked emails over at Nintendo.

821
01:11:34,847 --> 01:11:38,469
Also a little shoutout to our gremlins,

822
01:11:38,469 --> 01:11:41,030
our babies at home who made, yep.

823
01:11:42,228 --> 01:11:48,291
And also to Iko the cat, thank you very much for that Wednesday before launch.

824
01:11:48,291 --> 01:11:57,614
Well that was unexpected.

825
01:11:57,614 --> 01:12:01,976
Thanks, this is Alcalocas second Seamus McNally by the way.

826
01:12:01,976 --> 01:12:04,737
He won another one 25 years ago.

827
01:12:04,737 --> 01:12:07,118
So, congrats to Alec.

828
01:12:07,118 --> 01:12:10,479
Thank you for all the people that we've...

829
01:12:11,180 --> 01:12:15,842
All the people who have supported us over the years. This is a weird game

830
01:12:15,842 --> 01:12:18,844
We're still shocked that people that have found an audience and people were into it

831
01:12:18,844 --> 01:12:26,167
Um, there's too many people to thank for me personally. I just wanted to thank my friend Charles who's not here right now. He was

832
01:12:26,167 --> 01:12:29,169
He's just a good guy and he's been there and like my corner the entire time

833
01:12:29,169 --> 01:12:35,092
Also our friend Carla who's over there with the rest of the team of Fulbright

834
01:12:35,092 --> 01:12:39,534
Very much helped us through some pretty hard times and

835
01:12:39,995 --> 01:12:44,838
Yeah, thanks to Bethany and thanks to Alec and everyone else on the stage.

836
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:45,138
Thank you.

837
01:12:45,138 --> 01:12:45,778
Yes, a dinner to all the things.

838
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:46,079
Um, I don't know.

839
01:12:46,079 --> 01:12:58,166
I was just thinking about this and it's just kind of weird that I grew up in like

840
01:12:58,166 --> 01:13:00,188
Mifflin County, PA.

841
01:13:00,188 --> 01:13:05,171
Um, and it's just cool that a lot of people really enjoyed a lot of the

842
01:13:05,171 --> 01:13:09,674
stories that were things that I grew up with and family history and it seemed to

843
01:13:10,741 --> 01:13:13,301
hit a court with people.

844
01:13:13,301 --> 01:13:13,922
So thank you.

845
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:14,442
Thanks everyone.

846
01:13:14,442 --> 01:13:33,926
Night in the Woods, everyone.

847
01:13:33,926 --> 01:13:35,326
How about that?

848
01:13:35,326 --> 01:13:35,766
Alright.

849
01:13:35,766 --> 01:13:36,466
Yeah, Night in the Woods.

850
01:13:36,466 --> 01:13:37,886
Come on, come on, come on.

851
01:13:37,886 --> 01:13:38,767
Round it up.

852
01:13:45,470 --> 01:13:51,854
Alright, so we're nearing the end of the show, so there's a few people that I want to thank.

853
01:13:51,854 --> 01:13:55,917
Of course, our incredible sponsors.

854
01:13:55,917 --> 01:14:01,600
IGF Platinum sponsor, iD at Xbox.

855
01:14:01,600 --> 01:14:04,402
Thank you so much.

856
01:14:04,402 --> 01:14:05,303
The IGF Platform sponsor, Steam.

857
01:14:05,303 --> 01:14:07,084
I see him over there.

858
01:14:09,736 --> 01:14:16,061
I'd also like to thank all of the incredible finalists here tonight.

859
01:14:16,061 --> 01:14:17,242
If you're a finalist, stand up.

860
01:14:17,242 --> 01:14:18,624
Get on your feet.

861
01:14:18,624 --> 01:14:19,925
Come on, let's see you all.

862
01:14:19,925 --> 01:14:22,007
Get up, let's see your faces if you're a finalist.

863
01:14:22,007 --> 01:14:22,487
Come on!

864
01:14:22,487 --> 01:14:33,897
Alright, here they are.

865
01:14:33,897 --> 01:14:34,497
Well done.

866
01:14:45,116 --> 01:14:50,933
So thank you, all of you, for your incredible, absolutely mind-blowing contributions to our

867
01:14:50,933 --> 01:14:52,597
medium. Thank you so much.

868
01:14:54,843 --> 01:14:57,463
All right, so honorable mentions as well.

869
01:14:57,463 --> 01:15:00,724
I mean, some of those folks don't even get to come here

870
01:15:00,724 --> 01:15:02,364
to San Francisco to GDC.

871
01:15:02,364 --> 01:15:03,944
They may not even be at the show.

872
01:15:03,944 --> 01:15:05,605
They may not have a GDC pass,

873
01:15:05,605 --> 01:15:07,785
but they're an honorable mention in a show

874
01:15:07,785 --> 01:15:10,065
that has over 500, over 400 entries.

875
01:15:10,065 --> 01:15:14,466
I mean, that's still an incredible achievement.

876
01:15:14,466 --> 01:15:16,366
So please put your hands together

877
01:15:16,366 --> 01:15:23,988
for all of the honorable mentions this year of the IGFs.

878
01:15:23,988 --> 01:15:24,208
Yeah.

879
01:15:26,035 --> 01:15:29,158
This year's judges and juries, thank you.

880
01:15:29,158 --> 01:15:31,320
I hope we didn't rattle too many friendships

881
01:15:31,320 --> 01:15:34,282
with all those debates and arguments that no doubt went down.

882
01:15:34,282 --> 01:15:37,164
And of course, all the crew behind the scenes tonight

883
01:15:37,164 --> 01:15:38,245
making the magic happen.

884
01:15:38,245 --> 01:15:41,168
I mean, I forced them all to do three dress rehearsals,

885
01:15:41,168 --> 01:15:42,889
so thank you so much for that.

886
01:15:42,889 --> 01:15:46,752
That includes Callie, Sandesh, Simon,

887
01:15:46,752 --> 01:15:49,434
and of course, GDC's brand new GM, Katie Stern.

888
01:15:49,434 --> 01:15:51,156
Everyone, please give her a warm welcome.

889
01:16:00,588 --> 01:16:04,330
Alright, so that brings us to the end of the indie show, but I mean, don't get up, don't

890
01:16:04,330 --> 01:16:14,237
get out of your seats, stay right where you are, because coming up next is the 18th annual

891
01:16:14,237 --> 01:16:17,099
Legend of Zelda Awards.

892
01:16:17,099 --> 01:16:19,601
Get ready everybody, get ready.

893
01:16:20,838 --> 01:16:25,240
Obviously it's the 18th Game Developer Choice Awards with all of our favourite awards like

894
01:16:25,240 --> 01:16:31,123
Best Money, Most Tigers at a GDC Party and of course the PUBG of the Year Award.

895
01:16:33,703 --> 01:16:37,966
Some seriously incredible talent on display tonight, folks.

896
01:16:37,966 --> 01:16:41,588
Some phenomenal games and very deserving developers.

897
01:16:41,588 --> 01:16:43,890
So don't go anywhere as Robin Haneke,

898
01:16:43,890 --> 01:16:47,472
who is indie as fuck, is about to get on stage

899
01:16:47,472 --> 01:16:50,254
and absolutely slay at the 18th Annual

900
01:16:50,254 --> 01:16:51,915
Game Developers Choice Awards.

901
01:16:51,915 --> 01:16:54,877
I'm Trent Custers, I've been your host this evening.

902
01:16:54,877 --> 01:16:55,738
Have a wonderful night.

903
01:17:38,632 --> 01:17:48,277
Ladies and gentlemen, we are pleased to begin the second half of our evening and welcome you to the 18th annual Game Developers Choice Awards.

904
01:17:48,277 --> 01:17:52,580
Please welcome the host of the evening, Robin Hunneke.

905
01:17:52,580 --> 01:18:07,368
Hello.

906
01:18:10,398 --> 01:18:12,098
Indies fuck, yeah that's right.

907
01:18:12,098 --> 01:18:17,700
Hello, welcome everyone to the 18th Annual Game Developers Choice Awards.

908
01:18:17,700 --> 01:18:28,103
Let's give it a round of applause because it's badass.

909
01:18:28,103 --> 01:18:28,423
Woo!

910
01:18:28,423 --> 01:18:29,223
Woo!

911
01:18:29,223 --> 01:18:29,823
Woo!

912
01:18:29,823 --> 01:18:29,963
Woo!

913
01:18:29,963 --> 01:18:30,123
Woo!

914
01:18:30,123 --> 01:18:30,483
Woo!

915
01:18:30,483 --> 01:18:30,643
Woo!

916
01:18:30,643 --> 01:18:31,224
Woo!

917
01:18:31,224 --> 01:18:31,284
Woo!

918
01:18:31,284 --> 01:18:31,624
Woo!

919
01:18:31,624 --> 01:18:32,264
Woo!

920
01:18:32,264 --> 01:18:32,404
Woo!

921
01:18:32,404 --> 01:18:32,804
Woo!

922
01:18:32,804 --> 01:18:32,964
Woo!

923
01:18:32,964 --> 01:18:33,284
Woo!

924
01:18:33,284 --> 01:18:33,504
Woo!

925
01:18:33,504 --> 01:18:33,944
Woo!

926
01:18:33,944 --> 01:18:34,264
Woo!

927
01:18:34,264 --> 01:18:34,405
Woo!

928
01:18:34,405 --> 01:18:34,745
Woo!

929
01:18:37,903 --> 01:18:40,204
Rent the runway cannot touch that closet, babe.

930
01:18:40,204 --> 01:18:46,949
Before we begin, I would like to personally congratulate all of tonight's nominees across

931
01:18:46,949 --> 01:18:48,350
all categories.

932
01:18:48,350 --> 01:18:54,193
Getting nominated here is a sign that your peers across the crafts of game development

933
01:18:54,193 --> 01:18:57,055
truly cherish and value your work.

934
01:18:57,935 --> 01:19:03,077
Whether it's narrative, design, art, sound, or technology,

935
01:19:03,077 --> 01:19:06,858
your fellow developers know just what

936
01:19:06,858 --> 01:19:08,559
you went through to get here.

937
01:19:08,559 --> 01:19:12,260
And they choo, choo, choo's you.

938
01:19:12,260 --> 01:19:19,162
It is also very likely that you're making actual money

939
01:19:19,162 --> 01:19:21,303
for your publisher, so please pick up the check

940
01:19:21,303 --> 01:19:23,524
for the rest of us this week.

941
01:19:23,524 --> 01:19:23,704
Thank you.

942
01:19:24,792 --> 01:19:29,313
But seriously, y'all, if you are nominated and you can still stand, you're not too drunk,

943
01:19:29,313 --> 01:19:29,893
please do.

944
01:19:29,893 --> 01:19:30,493
Now's your chance.

945
01:19:30,493 --> 01:19:35,934
All nominees, stand up for a round of applause.

946
01:19:35,934 --> 01:19:37,975
It doesn't matter if you win.

947
01:19:37,975 --> 01:19:45,396
Fake it till you make it.

948
01:19:45,396 --> 01:19:49,277
Okay, now sit down and laugh at my jokes.

949
01:19:49,277 --> 01:19:52,338
Who are these magical, mysterious developers?

950
01:19:53,673 --> 01:19:58,396
There will be a lot of high production value videos to explain that about each of tonight's nominees,

951
01:19:58,396 --> 01:20:02,339
and I don't want to spoil it for any of you who are just here for the chiptunes.

952
01:20:02,339 --> 01:20:10,985
So, I will say this. Many of this year's games took decades of developer time to build,

953
01:20:10,985 --> 01:20:15,709
years of player time to enjoy, and mere seconds to become scapegoats for the NRA.

954
01:20:25,047 --> 01:20:29,590
Seriously though, 2018, as Kelly Wallach pointed out in her IGF chairperson remarks,

955
01:20:29,590 --> 01:20:34,394
presents us with opportunities to innovate, to be inclusive, and celebrate

956
01:20:34,394 --> 01:20:39,577
the stories of a much broader range of creatives. As a developer, a CEO, and a

957
01:20:39,577 --> 01:20:43,340
feminist, and an advocate for these values throughout my own career, it is so

958
01:20:43,340 --> 01:20:45,922
fucking nice to be able to stand up here and say that out loud.

959
01:20:54,787 --> 01:21:02,831
I for one am thrilled to be standing up here giving dudes awards, especially now that we

960
01:21:02,831 --> 01:21:15,177
are finally all in agreement about the fact that harass is one word.

961
01:21:15,177 --> 01:21:18,038
So let's get on with it, shall we?

962
01:21:18,038 --> 01:21:21,660
You never forget your first.

963
01:21:22,850 --> 01:21:28,252
I imagine almost everyone in this room fondly remembers their own debut game, a game that,

964
01:21:28,252 --> 01:21:33,215
despite many flaws, you could not help but be insanely proud of.

965
01:21:33,215 --> 01:21:36,917
Proud because against all odds, you managed to get it done.

966
01:21:38,188 --> 01:21:43,071
Sure, it would have been better to ship a slightly smaller version of your game, perhaps

967
01:21:43,071 --> 01:21:48,515
a year earlier on a platform that would actually fucking monetize, but you had a vision, and

968
01:21:48,515 --> 01:21:51,537
you saw it through to the bitter and bankrupt end.

969
01:21:51,537 --> 01:21:54,679
S'il vous plaît!

970
01:21:54,679 --> 01:21:59,602
A wise developer once told me that Mefford's first law of game development read thus.

971
01:22:00,370 --> 01:22:04,633
The worst thing that can happen to a young developer is for their game to be successful,

972
01:22:04,633 --> 01:22:09,276
as they might be tricked into thinking that they had something to do with it.

973
01:22:09,276 --> 01:22:13,959
So don't be jealous of these Best Debut nominees, pity them for they are destined to be fucked.

974
01:22:13,959 --> 01:22:20,183
Just spend the profits from this game on the next one which will do about half as well.

975
01:22:20,183 --> 01:22:23,385
The nominees are...

976
01:22:23,385 --> 01:22:25,647
Best Debut

977
01:22:25,647 --> 01:22:26,147

981
01:22:34,915 --> 01:22:37,595
David Kazi.

982
01:22:37,595 --> 01:22:40,616
Christopher Larkin.

983
01:22:40,616 --> 01:22:46,017
Sidebar Games, nominated for Golf Story.

984
01:22:46,017 --> 01:22:53,018

Studio MDHR, nominated for Cuphead.

986
01:22:59,961 --> 01:23:02,442

987
01:23:02,442 --> 01:23:10,726

Scott Benson.

992
01:23:23,032 --> 01:23:24,013
M Halberstadt.

993
01:23:24,013 --> 01:23:28,495
Buried Signal, nominated for Gorogoa.

994
01:23:30,053 --> 01:23:31,074
Jason Roberts.

995
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:42,940
I just love that last one, it's just him.

996
01:23:42,940 --> 01:23:45,542
It's a beautiful game.

997
01:23:45,542 --> 01:23:47,483
And the winner is...

998
01:23:47,483 --> 01:23:51,965
Cuphead.

999
01:24:34,722 --> 01:24:37,082
I can't believe you took the wrong steps.

1000
01:24:37,082 --> 01:24:42,283
I was here the whole time, and as I moved forward I heard front steps.

1001
01:24:42,283 --> 01:24:49,085
But still my heart led me in a direction in the same way of approaching this game, which

1002
01:24:49,085 --> 01:24:57,367
was go with what I'm feeling, go with what I know, and some of it pans out, such as this,

1003
01:24:57,367 --> 01:25:02,028
and some of it lets you do whatever I did.

1004
01:25:03,093 --> 01:25:08,680
We have to thank our whole team, which unfortunately not everyone is here, but this is a team effort for this game.

1005
01:25:08,680 --> 01:25:20,216
And our families, everybody for putting up with us, Microsoft, all of our fans, just super exciting to win this award. Thank you so much.

1006
01:25:33,393 --> 01:25:33,933
Such a good game.

1007
01:25:33,933 --> 01:25:38,715
Tonight's first nominee for Game of the Year...

1008
01:25:38,715 --> 01:25:40,715
Nier Automata.

1009
01:25:40,715 --> 01:25:43,456
Developed by Platinum Games.

1010
01:25:43,456 --> 01:25:46,217
Published by Square Enix.

1011
01:25:46,217 --> 01:25:48,178
Yoko Taro.

1012
01:25:48,178 --> 01:25:49,178
Yosuke Saito.

1013
01:25:49,178 --> 01:25:51,999
Takahisa Tarua.

1014
01:26:11,469 --> 01:26:12,769
destroyed? Not quite.

1015
01:26:12,769 --> 01:26:14,510
Anyone with parents over 40, or who

1016
01:26:14,510 --> 01:26:21,112
is one, is painfully familiar with the argument that smartphones

1017
01:26:21,112 --> 01:26:24,373
are the leading purveyors of social, political, and personal apathy.

1018
01:26:24,373 --> 01:26:27,934
Why do something productive when you can just thumb through your Instagram?

1019
01:26:28,582 --> 01:26:30,584
Why get to know that person sitting next to you?

1020
01:26:30,584 --> 01:26:33,788
We can text your cousin and ask about the Warrior score.

1021
01:26:33,788 --> 01:26:37,533
Why download music illegally when you can rent shitty copies of it that barely stream

1022
01:26:37,533 --> 01:26:38,775
to your handheld computer?

1023
01:26:38,775 --> 01:26:43,581
The truth is, there's no reason to do anything.

1024
01:26:47,727 --> 01:26:48,988
Control is an illusion.

1025
01:26:48,988 --> 01:26:53,450
The past is gone and the future is fucking unknowable.

1026
01:26:53,450 --> 01:26:57,212
So, you might as well download these nominees

1027
01:26:57,212 --> 01:27:00,633
for Best Mobile Game and decide if you agree on the winner,

1028
01:27:00,633 --> 01:27:01,134
especially if they're free.

1029
01:27:01,134 --> 01:27:01,434
The nominees are.

1030
01:27:01,434 --> 01:27:03,775

01:28:20,476 --> 01:28:22,597
Lorane Herbet.

1048
01:28:22,597 --> 01:28:27,019
I hate opening these envelopes.

1049
01:28:27,019 --> 01:28:32,241
The winner is Gorogoa.

1050
01:29:08,285 --> 01:29:11,388
Well, thanks everybody.

1051
01:29:11,388 --> 01:29:22,195
I think when I was up here back in 2014, I said that I started this, the journey of making this game alone,

1052
01:29:22,195 --> 01:29:26,618
but now I feel like I'm part of a big family, and that's especially true now.

1053
01:29:26,618 --> 01:29:31,042
I got my sound designer beside me. Thanks, Ed.

1054
01:29:35,354 --> 01:29:40,678
Thanks to Joel Korlitz, composer on the game.

1055
01:29:40,678 --> 01:29:42,840
Thanks to everybody at Annapurna Interactive,

1056
01:29:42,840 --> 01:29:48,264
without whom I think the game literally would never have been finished.

1057
01:29:48,264 --> 01:29:51,686
Yeah. You want to say anything, Ed?

1058
01:29:51,686 --> 01:29:56,830
Just thank you to Jason for letting me be part of this journey.

1059
01:29:56,830 --> 01:29:58,831
You're welcome. Thank you, Ed.

1060
01:29:58,831 --> 01:29:59,732
That's it. Thank you, guys.

1061
01:30:12,843 --> 01:30:17,009
The second nominee for Game of the Year,

1062
01:30:17,009 --> 01:30:19,292
Super Mario Odyssey,

1063
01:30:19,292 --> 01:30:21,095
developed by Nintendo EPD.

1064
01:30:21,095 --> 01:30:23,418
Published by Nintendo.

1065
01:30:23,418 --> 01:30:25,521
The Nintendo EPD Team.

1066
01:30:49,566 --> 01:30:53,147
Narrative in games have come a long way in a short time.

1067
01:30:53,147 --> 01:30:56,508
It wasn't that long ago that most antagonists in games

1068
01:30:56,508 --> 01:30:59,769
were two-dimensional caricatures of villains

1069
01:30:59,769 --> 01:31:03,129
devoid of motivation for all their wrongdoings.

1070
01:31:03,129 --> 01:31:06,770
Developers didn't need a reason to have a player shoot

1071
01:31:06,770 --> 01:31:08,971
thousands of rounds of ammo, chewing

1072
01:31:08,971 --> 01:31:12,372
through hundreds of digital enemies in their games.

1073
01:31:12,372 --> 01:31:14,052
But look at us now.

1074
01:31:14,052 --> 01:31:16,193
Now, games can tell moving stories.

1075
01:31:16,715 --> 01:31:20,557
deeply personal stories before sending the player off to kill their way through hours

1076
01:31:20,557 --> 01:31:21,677
of entertainment.

1077
01:31:21,677 --> 01:31:28,021
As our nominees in this category illustrate, some developers are willing to do much, much

1078
01:31:28,021 --> 01:31:28,681
more.

1079
01:31:28,681 --> 01:31:37,766
They are willing to take risks and weave tales that make us laugh, make us think, and make

1080
01:31:37,766 --> 01:31:38,166
us ask why.

1081
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:44,670
Let's all press F to pay respect to these nominees.

1082
01:31:45,726 --> 01:31:50,709
Developed by Infinite Fall.

1083
01:31:50,709 --> 01:31:53,050
Published by Finji.

1084
01:31:53,050 --> 01:31:56,272
Bethany Hockenberry.

1085
01:31:56,272 --> 01:31:56,853
Scott Benson.

1086
01:31:56,853 --> 01:31:57,213
Alec Holoka.

1087
01:31:57,213 --> 01:31:57,873
Hellblade, Senua's Sacrifice.

1088
01:31:57,873 --> 01:32:03,437
Developed by Ninja Theory.

1089
01:32:03,437 --> 01:32:07,699
Tamim Antoniades.

1090
01:32:07,699 --> 01:32:10,601
The Northmen say the world will come to an end.

1091
01:32:13,465 --> 01:32:19,688
What Remains of Edith Finch, developed by Giant Sparrow,

1092
01:32:19,688 --> 01:32:22,649
published by Annapurna Interactive.

1093
01:32:22,649 --> 01:32:24,149
The Giant Sparrow Team.

1094
01:32:24,149 --> 01:32:28,411
Maybe we believed so much in a family curse, we made it real.

1095
01:32:28,411 --> 01:32:34,353
Horizon Zero Dawn, developed by Guerrilla Games,

1096
01:32:34,353 --> 01:32:37,414
published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

1097
01:32:37,414 --> 01:32:39,495
The Guerrilla Team.

1098
01:32:43,466 --> 01:32:46,887
Wolfenstein II, the New Colossus,

1099
01:32:46,887 --> 01:32:51,649
developed by Machine Games, published by Bethesda Softworks.

1100
01:32:51,649 --> 01:33:01,413
Jens Mappes, Joerg Gustafsson, Tommy Tordtsen-Bjork.

1101
01:33:01,413 --> 01:33:05,194
And the Best Narrative Award goes

1102
01:33:05,194 --> 01:33:07,575
to What Remains of Edith Bitsch.

1103
01:33:31,233 --> 01:33:42,523
Thank you. There's so many good, sound reasons why this game should not have been started, or funded, or completed.

1104
01:33:42,523 --> 01:33:51,751
But thank you so much to the team, and all of our friends at Sony and Annapurna for your tireless patience and enthusiasm in being sure that it does exist. Thank you.

1105
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:51,891
Yeah.

1106
01:33:51,891 --> 01:33:52,111
Chelsea?

1107
01:33:52,111 --> 01:33:52,412
Yeah.

1108
01:33:52,412 --> 01:33:52,972
I just...

1109
01:33:53,973 --> 01:34:01,000
After being a part of this community for so long and seeing so many amazing things created

1110
01:34:01,000 --> 01:34:09,989
by so many amazing people, just being here is such an honor and I'm so grateful for everybody

1111
01:34:09,989 --> 01:34:11,531
who made it possible, Annapurna, Sony, and thank you.

1112
01:34:16,627 --> 01:34:18,148
Hey everyone.

1113
01:34:18,148 --> 01:34:19,970
Yeah, this was a labor of love.

1114
01:34:19,970 --> 01:34:22,072
It took everything to get this done.

1115
01:34:22,072 --> 01:34:23,433
We went through a big road of trials.

1116
01:34:23,433 --> 01:34:26,016
Special thanks to my brother who's sitting right here,

1117
01:34:26,016 --> 01:34:27,577
who was a big help on the game.

1118
01:34:27,577 --> 01:34:29,919
My girlfriend, my parents, all our families.

1119
01:34:29,919 --> 01:34:32,962
Everyone put, like, way more than themselves into this,

1120
01:34:32,962 --> 01:34:34,083
and it's fucking amazing.

1121
01:34:34,083 --> 01:34:34,744
I love you guys.

1122
01:34:52,917 --> 01:35:09,080
Here tonight to present the Ambassador of the Year Award is Poria Torkin.

1123
01:35:09,080 --> 01:35:11,841
Good evening.

1124
01:35:11,841 --> 01:35:12,801
I was born in Iran.

1125
01:35:12,801 --> 01:35:17,442
My family fled to the Netherlands when I was six years old.

1126
01:35:17,442 --> 01:35:19,522
But I was lucky.

1127
01:35:20,896 --> 01:35:25,797
Growing up Dutch provided me with incredible opportunities that many children like me never had.

1128
01:35:25,797 --> 01:35:34,719
I was incredibly fortunate to spend several years working and growing at the Peerless Guerrilla Games in Amsterdam.

1129
01:35:34,719 --> 01:35:39,460
Hermen, Angie, thank you for all the opportunities you gave me. Thank you so much.

1130
01:35:39,460 --> 01:35:43,982
And later...

1131
01:35:45,017 --> 01:35:49,258
When I applied to a studio I've wanted to work at ever since I first played Halo,

1132
01:35:49,258 --> 01:35:50,679
Bungie brought me to the United States.

1133
01:35:50,679 --> 01:35:56,681
I am lucky, and today, standing in front of a room filled with my peers,

1134
01:35:56,681 --> 01:35:59,702
I am honored to introduce my dear friend Rami.

1135
01:35:59,702 --> 01:36:09,546
Because not everyone has been as lucky as I have been.

1136
01:36:10,863 --> 01:36:15,404
It is easy to forget that there are hundreds of thousands of people across the globe

1137
01:36:15,404 --> 01:36:20,385
who would drop everything to have an internationally acclaimed game studio nearby their homes.

1138
01:36:20,385 --> 01:36:25,866
And there are hundreds of thousands of people who share the dream of standing on this stage,

1139
01:36:25,866 --> 01:36:31,567
or even simply being in this room, but who do not have the opportunities that we were granted.

1140
01:36:31,567 --> 01:36:36,367
They didn't have access to the knowledge, the jobs, the network, the press, and the visas

1141
01:36:36,367 --> 01:36:38,568
that we, and definitely I, benefited from.

1142
01:36:39,618 --> 01:36:43,819
all for reasons entirely out of their control.

1143
01:36:43,819 --> 01:36:49,921
It is because of and for these people that we are honoring Rami tonight.

1144
01:36:49,921 --> 01:37:01,125
He is not just receiving this award for his passion for independent development, his love

1145
01:37:01,125 --> 01:37:07,207
of games and the power they have to change us, or his formidable beard.

1146
01:37:09,753 --> 01:37:12,756
He is receiving this award for his accomplishments and work,

1147
01:37:12,756 --> 01:37:16,279
focused on providing people with opportunities and access

1148
01:37:16,279 --> 01:37:20,902
that each and any of us deserve, but not all of us are granted.

1149
01:37:20,902 --> 01:37:24,225
His studio, Flumbeer, has diverted significant resources

1150
01:37:24,225 --> 01:37:26,466
towards helping fellow and aspiring game developers.

1151
01:37:26,466 --> 01:37:28,728
From creating DoPressKit, a free tool which

1152
01:37:28,728 --> 01:37:32,671
is used by thousands of independent and mid-sized

1153
01:37:32,671 --> 01:37:33,632
developers around the world.

1154
01:37:39,251 --> 01:37:43,392
to working with young initiatives like Train Jam, Indie Mega Boots, or Playground.

1155
01:37:43,392 --> 01:37:48,653
From supporting and advising platforms and events with their indie offerings,

1156
01:37:48,653 --> 01:37:50,894
to organizing One Reason to Be,

1157
01:37:50,894 --> 01:37:54,735
he consistently uses his reach to raise awareness and urgency

1158
01:37:54,735 --> 01:37:58,356
on things he recognizes as unjust or underrepresented.

1159
01:37:59,647 --> 01:38:03,869
He spends a significant portion of his time traveling to emerging territories to speak

1160
01:38:03,869 --> 01:38:09,472
to students, local developers and investors, governments and accelerators, museums, universities

1161
01:38:09,472 --> 01:38:09,972
and media.

1162
01:38:09,972 --> 01:38:17,357
All with the goal to help cultivate game development communities and guide opportunities for developers

1163
01:38:17,357 --> 01:38:18,017
with potential.

1164
01:38:18,017 --> 01:38:25,341
And perhaps most notable of all, he introduced his mother to Final Fantasy and shared that

1165
01:38:25,341 --> 01:38:26,882
experience with all of us on Twitter.

1166
01:38:33,943 --> 01:38:39,834
Please join me in welcoming my friend, the man with as many names as initiatives, Rami

1167
01:38:39,834 --> 01:38:42,279
Ibrahim Mahmoud Hanafi Ismail.

1168
01:39:36,627 --> 01:39:44,194
Assalamu alaikum. My name is Rami Ismail, one half of Dutch Independent Studio of Lambeer,

1169
01:39:44,194 --> 01:39:51,400
and I'm thankful. I am thankful to my parents, who have each in their own way inspired me

1170
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:57,125
to be driven, humble, and curious. Their presence here tonight means the world to me.

1171
01:40:06,168 --> 01:40:11,451
I'm thankful for my siblings who have instilled in me a sense of playfulness, of responsibility

1172
01:40:11,451 --> 01:40:13,212
and a kindness towards others.

1173
01:40:13,212 --> 01:40:19,296
I'm thankful towards my family and friends who, despite not many understanding what it

1174
01:40:19,296 --> 01:40:22,839
is I do, have always supported me in following my passions.

1175
01:40:22,839 --> 01:40:31,364
I am thankful for those who created and worked in this medium and industry long before I

1176
01:40:31,364 --> 01:40:32,205
was part of it.

1177
01:40:32,205 --> 01:40:35,907
For creating a medium that I fell in love with decades ago.

1178
01:40:37,174 --> 01:40:41,017
for nurturing a culture of sharing and self-improvement,

1179
01:40:41,017 --> 01:40:45,221
and for working on improving this industry,

1180
01:40:45,221 --> 01:40:47,223
tiny step by tiny step.

1181
01:40:47,223 --> 01:40:48,904
I will try to uphold those values,

1182
01:40:48,904 --> 01:40:50,886
and I will try to improve upon that

1183
01:40:50,886 --> 01:40:53,008
which you would not or could not.

1184
01:40:54,717 --> 01:40:59,818
I'm thankful to everyone who took a chance on me, and there are many of you from my early

1185
01:40:59,818 --> 01:41:02,539
childhood until just today.

1186
01:41:02,539 --> 01:41:06,780
I'm very aware that I'm far from perfect and that many of you have worked hard to support

1187
01:41:06,780 --> 01:41:13,181
me, teach me, correct me, work around or with my idiosyncrasies, and help me do what I do.

1188
01:41:13,181 --> 01:41:18,983
I'm thankful to my co-founder, JW, who despite our well-documented differences...

1189
01:41:24,830 --> 01:41:29,093
who despite our well documented differences has always been a person I'm thankful to work with

1190
01:41:29,093 --> 01:41:37,859
and who has, without exception or reservation, supported me using Flamberg's time, brand and resources to help other developers

1191
01:41:37,859 --> 01:41:40,842
and pushes me to stand up for what I believe is right.

1192
01:41:40,842 --> 01:41:44,684
I'm thankful to my wife, Adriaan.

1193
01:41:53,138 --> 01:41:57,260
Who I met through games, who proposed to me through games,

1194
01:41:57,260 --> 01:42:01,322
and who has, through support and example,

1195
01:42:01,322 --> 01:42:04,963
shown to me what it means to be a gracious, considerate,

1196
01:42:04,963 --> 01:42:09,145
and inspiring human first, and a hardworking, generous,

1197
01:42:09,145 --> 01:42:10,886
and responsible creator second.

1198
01:42:10,886 --> 01:42:13,907
Her generosity and thoughtfulness

1199
01:42:13,907 --> 01:42:15,068
are a daily inspiration.

1200
01:42:16,493 --> 01:42:20,396
I'm thankful to the passionate players around the world, those that support this medium

1201
01:42:20,396 --> 01:42:24,659
with their passion, their kindness, their constructive criticism, their curiosity, and

1202
01:42:24,659 --> 01:42:27,861
their love for this medium and its creators.

1203
01:42:27,861 --> 01:42:33,024
Your enthusiasm is an inspiration, a goal to work towards, and a reward all at once.

1204
01:42:34,617 --> 01:42:39,538
I'm thankful for the designers, the programmers, the artists, the musicians, the actors, sound

1205
01:42:39,538 --> 01:42:45,660
designers, writers, QA, localizers, platforms, publishers, press, critics, content creators,

1206
01:42:45,660 --> 01:42:51,301
marketeers, investors, producers, and other people that touched games on their way from

1207
01:42:51,301 --> 01:42:55,322
the tiniest concept to the curious input and hearts of a player.

1208
01:42:55,322 --> 01:43:03,164
You are all part of what allows this medium to flourish, and this medium is better for

1209
01:43:03,164 --> 01:43:04,205
having you be part of it.

1210
01:43:05,870 --> 01:43:10,993
I am thankful for the event organizers, community organizers, teachers and professors, government

1211
01:43:10,993 --> 01:43:16,477
employees, archivists, activists, researchers, and other passionate people sacrificing part

1212
01:43:16,477 --> 01:43:23,202
of their life towards helping this industry and community connect and grow.

1213
01:43:23,202 --> 01:43:28,126
Without your passion and efforts, I would not be able to visit your communities, to

1214
01:43:28,126 --> 01:43:33,110
learn from your cities, your cultures, and your country's unique stories, challenges,

1215
01:43:33,110 --> 01:43:34,030
and opportunities.

1216
01:43:36,272 --> 01:43:44,700
I am thankful for those that work and fight to democratize this medium, to stand against

1217
01:43:44,700 --> 01:43:50,606
injustice and toxicity, despite the hatred, anger, and so often lack of support they face.

1218
01:43:50,606 --> 01:43:57,112
Your belief that this medium can be more makes this medium safer.

1219
01:43:58,287 --> 01:44:05,190
more representative, more accessible, and more inclusive to those of any sex, race,

1220
01:44:05,190 --> 01:44:13,275
gender, sexuality, ideology, heritage, history, language, country, culture, disability, socio-economic

1221
01:44:13,275 --> 01:44:15,236
reality, age, or situation.

1222
01:44:24,170 --> 01:44:31,671
I am thankful to those of you who participate in this medium despite feeling or being treated

1223
01:44:31,671 --> 01:44:34,152
as different or out of place.

1224
01:44:34,152 --> 01:44:43,194
I am thankful to those of you who participate in this medium and would want to be here,

1225
01:44:43,194 --> 01:44:47,935
in this room, but could not be here due to their financial, geographical or political

1226
01:44:47,935 --> 01:44:53,336
realities.

1227
01:44:54,358 --> 01:45:00,942
adds perspective to our medium and your work will continue to make our medium stronger,

1228
01:45:00,942 --> 01:45:07,227
richer and more representative. I'm thankful for those of you who are now taking their first step

1229
01:45:07,227 --> 01:45:11,490
into our medium or who dream of one day being part of it.

1230
01:45:12,128 --> 01:45:18,451
As a medium, as an industry, as a people, we have our challenges and problems, we have

1231
01:45:18,451 --> 01:45:24,314
our disagreements and controversies, but throughout all of human history, people have created

1232
01:45:24,314 --> 01:45:29,437
ways to be playful, ways to be curious, and ways to learn.

1233
01:45:29,437 --> 01:45:32,918
And you well might choose to take that torch forward into the future.

1234
01:45:32,918 --> 01:45:38,181
And if you do, I hope that you will try to improve.

1235
01:45:38,723 --> 01:45:43,385
upon that which we here today will not or cannot.

1236
01:45:43,385 --> 01:45:50,266
Being an ambassador of something can only be a point of pride if you believe that that

1237
01:45:50,266 --> 01:45:52,227
which you represent is valuable.

1238
01:45:52,227 --> 01:46:00,809
Throughout my life, I've seen games give people joy, wonder, curiosity, a means of

1239
01:46:00,809 --> 01:46:06,810
expression, education, friendship, and love through both play and creation.

1240
01:46:08,305 --> 01:46:12,109
So the overwhelming pride I feel in receiving this award

1241
01:46:12,109 --> 01:46:16,133
comes not from the award itself or from the title implied in it.

1242
01:46:16,133 --> 01:46:19,976
The pride I feel comes from the idea

1243
01:46:19,976 --> 01:46:23,780
that I could be an ambassador for you, the work that you do,

1244
01:46:23,780 --> 01:46:29,465
and the value it adds to life's current, past, and future.

1245
01:46:29,465 --> 01:46:31,647
So I'm thankful for those who support you.

1246
01:46:32,326 --> 01:46:36,969
for those who encourage you, and for those who believe in you.

1247
01:46:36,969 --> 01:46:39,350
Because I am thankful for you.

1248
01:46:39,350 --> 01:46:43,093
All of you, you are why I am proud right now.

1249
01:46:43,093 --> 01:46:49,056
And that pride, I feel, can only exist because I am proud of you.

1250
01:46:49,056 --> 01:46:49,496
Make aims.

1251
01:47:07,426 --> 01:47:15,852
Tonight's third nominee for Game of the Year, The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1252
01:47:15,852 --> 01:47:18,875
Developed by Nintendo EPD.

1253

The Nintendo EPD Team.

1255
01:47:43,491 --> 01:47:47,133
Hello everybody. Still here. Alright.

1256
01:47:47,133 --> 01:47:51,396
I think we can all agree that technology makes our lives so much better.

1257
01:47:51,396 --> 01:47:56,220
From untraceable currency primarily used in illegal transactions

1258
01:47:56,220 --> 01:48:01,263
to social media platforms that bring unsolicited dick pics right into your DMs.

1259
01:48:01,263 --> 01:48:04,926
There's pretty much no such thing as bad technology.

1260
01:48:06,262 --> 01:48:08,802
And our industry is certainly no exception.

1261
01:48:08,802 --> 01:48:17,506
Think of all the ways we innovate even when we make the same game over and over and over again.

1262
01:48:17,506 --> 01:48:33,031
Really, the only thing more amazing than the engineering work that is gluing together the interactive experiences showcased here tonight is the fact that I didn't have to say blockchain even once.

1263
01:48:33,031 --> 01:48:34,832
The nominees are.

1264
01:48:34,832 --> 01:48:35,672

The Nintendo EPD team.

1280
01:49:51,909 --> 01:50:00,933
And the award for best technology goes to Horizon Zero Dawn.

1281
01:50:46,237 --> 01:50:52,698
So yeah, let's make a open world RPG in our first person engine, sure.

1282
01:50:52,698 --> 01:50:58,860
Oh, and we want to have giant fucking robots as well, too.

1283
01:50:58,860 --> 01:51:00,761
Robot dinosaurs, please, yes, no problem.

1284
01:51:00,761 --> 01:51:05,982
You can imagine those design meetings we had back then, it was fun.

1285
01:51:05,982 --> 01:51:10,123
But holy shit, we pulled it off, and I'm super proud of this achievement.

1286
01:51:13,861 --> 01:51:22,688
First of all, I'd like to thank our amazing fans for their feedback, the GIFs that we got, the videos, the screenshots.

1287
01:51:22,688 --> 01:51:25,150
It's super awesome to see all that stuff.

1288
01:51:25,150 --> 01:51:28,772
I'd like to thank our family for being very, very, very patient with us.

1289
01:51:28,772 --> 01:51:35,518
I'd like to thank Sony WWS for sticking with us in this crazy plan that we had.

1290
01:51:35,518 --> 01:51:42,263
And of course, I'd like to thank all the people at Guerrilla, including the people we did not bring.

1291
01:51:43,282 --> 01:51:44,222
There's a few of them.

1292
01:51:44,222 --> 01:51:48,085
And I'd like to thank all of you for this amazing award.

1293
01:51:48,085 --> 01:51:48,345
Super proud.

1294
01:51:48,345 --> 01:51:48,905
Thank you.

1295
01:51:48,905 --> 01:51:49,426
Thank you.

1296
01:51:49,426 --> 01:51:49,746
Thank you.

1297
01:51:49,746 --> 01:51:49,946
Thank you.

1298
01:51:49,946 --> 01:51:50,166
Thank you.

1299
01:51:50,166 --> 01:51:50,386
Thank you.

1300
01:51:50,386 --> 01:51:50,566
Thank you.

1301
01:51:50,566 --> 01:51:55,089
Thank you.

1302
01:51:55,089 --> 01:51:57,491
Thank you.

1303
01:51:57,491 --> 01:51:57,711
Thank you.

1304
01:51:57,711 --> 01:51:57,931
Thank you.

1305
01:51:57,931 --> 01:51:58,131
Thank you.

1306
01:51:58,131 --> 01:51:58,472
Thank you.

Thank you.

1310
01:52:01,193 --> 01:52:02,014
Thank you please.

1311
01:52:02,014 --> 01:52:02,494
Thank you.

1312
01:52:02,494 --> 01:52:04,095
Thank you, Thank you.

1313
01:52:04,095 --> 01:52:04,676
Thank you.

1314
01:52:04,676 --> 01:52:05,496
Thank you thank you.

1315
01:52:05,496 --> 01:52:06,297
Thank you.

1316
01:52:06,297 --> 01:52:07,297
Thank you.

1317
01:52:07,297 --> 01:52:07,818
Thank you.

1318
01:52:07,818 --> 01:52:08,098
Thank you.

1319
01:52:08,098 --> 01:52:08,818
Thank you.

1320
01:52:08,818 --> 01:52:09,199
Thank you.

1321
01:52:09,199 --> 01:52:09,499
Thank you.

1322
01:52:09,499 --> 01:52:10,199
Thank you.

1323
01:52:10,199 --> 01:52:10,640
Thank you.

1324
01:52:10,640 --> 01:52:10,900
Thank you.

1325
01:52:10,900 --> 01:52:11,400
Thank you.

1326
01:52:11,400 --> 01:52:11,660
Thank you.

1327
01:52:11,660 --> 01:52:11,920
Thank you.

1328
01:52:11,920 --> 01:52:12,301
Thank you.

1329
01:52:13,261 --> 01:52:16,344
Uh... what are you?

1330
01:52:16,344 --> 01:52:23,089
I'm a human. What are you?

1331
01:52:23,089 --> 01:52:26,492
I uh... I uh...

1332
01:52:26,492 --> 01:52:29,114
Don't... know.

1333
01:52:29,114 --> 01:52:32,357
Once, I knew who I was.

1334
01:52:32,357 --> 01:52:35,619
It was a me.

1335
01:52:35,619 --> 01:52:37,521
A Mario.

1336
01:52:37,521 --> 01:52:41,464
But now, I know nothing.

1337
01:52:41,464 --> 01:52:42,885
You don't understand!

1338
01:52:43,501 --> 01:52:46,283
I am not a human! I am not a toad!

1339
01:52:46,283 --> 01:52:48,625
You're a... Mario!

1340
01:52:48,625 --> 01:52:49,705
What is a Mario?

1341
01:52:49,705 --> 01:52:52,247
You're my husband!

1342
01:52:52,247 --> 01:52:57,170
That's not enough!

1343
01:52:57,170 --> 01:53:06,757
Whoever fights monsters should see to it he does not become a monster himself.

1344
01:53:07,638 --> 01:53:18,685
And if you gaze long enough into an abyss,

1345
01:53:18,685 --> 01:53:32,973
the abyss will gaze back into you.

1346
01:53:36,745 --> 01:53:41,587
And he will become a monster.

1347
01:53:41,587 --> 01:53:46,850
You're tearing this family apart!

1348
01:53:46,850 --> 01:53:53,954
Shut the fuck up, Luigi!

1349
01:53:53,954 --> 01:53:59,997
Brings himself of a being, a man.

1350
01:53:59,997 --> 01:54:02,698
Ha ha ha ha ha!

1351
01:54:02,698 --> 01:54:03,759
Who am I?

1352
01:54:12,228 --> 01:54:13,754
Amen.

1353
01:54:13,754 --> 01:54:14,738
Amen.

1354
01:54:14,738 --> 01:54:14,959
Amen.

1355
01:54:14,959 --> 01:54:15,260
Amen.

1356
01:54:15,260 --> 01:54:15,702
Amen.

1357
01:54:15,702 --> 01:54:15,963
Amen.

1358
01:54:17,946 --> 01:54:18,547
It's me.

1359
01:54:18,547 --> 01:54:23,410
One of the things unique to audio and video games

1360
01:54:23,410 --> 01:54:26,693
that is often done with a very small team.

1361
01:54:26,693 --> 01:54:30,476
Unlike, say, graphics, which can employ many, many artists

1362
01:54:30,476 --> 01:54:33,959
and programmers working to achieve a desired visual

1363
01:54:33,959 --> 01:54:37,341
effect, audio often comes down to the craftsmanship

1364
01:54:37,341 --> 01:54:38,142
of just a few people.

1365
01:54:38,142 --> 01:54:44,527
Sometimes it's just one slightly weird dedicated person

1366
01:54:44,527 --> 01:54:46,349
working hard to achieve their vision.

1367
01:54:47,471 --> 01:54:52,752
In this way, audio developers impact a game on a much more personal level than almost

1368
01:54:52,752 --> 01:54:56,093
any other discipline, which is pretty fucking cool.

1369
01:54:56,093 --> 01:55:04,835
This is the part where I describe how these special privileges make audio people really

1370
01:55:04,835 --> 01:55:10,356
difficult to deal with at times, like especially around deadlines.

1371
01:55:10,557 --> 01:55:18,761
But honestly, I actually really believe that audio folks are the truly unsung heroes of game development.

1372
01:55:18,761 --> 01:55:28,925
So I'm just going to let these nominees roll with mucho gratitude.

1373
01:55:28,925 --> 01:55:29,626
Best Audio

1374
01:55:29,626 --> 01:55:30,586

1386
01:56:12,421 --> 01:56:16,122
The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1387
01:56:16,122 --> 01:56:19,103
Developed by Nintendo EPD.

1388
01:56:19,103 --> 01:56:20,204
Published by Nintendo.

1389
01:56:20,204 --> 01:56:24,666
The Nintendo EPD team.

1390
01:56:24,666 --> 01:56:29,487
Horizon Zero Dawn.

1391
01:56:29,487 --> 01:56:33,389
Developed by Guerrilla Games.

1392
01:56:33,389 --> 01:56:36,630
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

1393
01:56:36,630 --> 01:56:38,471
The Guerrilla team.

1394
01:56:45,370 --> 01:56:51,717
And the Best Audio Award goes to...

1395
01:56:51,717 --> 01:56:52,818
The Legend of Zelda.

1396
01:57:24,173 --> 01:57:29,336
Awesome. Hi everyone, and thank you so much for this award.

1397
01:57:29,336 --> 01:57:36,840
My name is Cindy. I work at Nintendo, and it is my honor, my privilege, to accept this award tonight

1398
01:57:36,840 --> 01:57:41,802
on behalf of the Zelda team and also on behalf of

1399
01:57:41,802 --> 01:57:44,283
Nintendo guy who couldn't be here tonight.

1400
01:57:49,553 --> 01:57:52,435
We like him, he's a keeper.

1401
01:57:52,435 --> 01:57:58,958
Now, Hajime Wakai is not only a really cool name to say,

1402
01:57:58,958 --> 01:58:06,082
Hajime Wakai and his team of talents are responsible for the amazing sounds in Zelda,

1403
01:58:06,082 --> 01:58:07,443
and often theatrical sounds.

1404
01:58:07,983 --> 01:58:14,125
You know, so whether it's the, for me, the sound of the wind blowing through that grassy plain

1405
01:58:14,125 --> 01:58:21,327
or the buzz of the insects that you hear when you're standing on a mountain at sunrise,

1406
01:58:21,327 --> 01:58:25,808
Hyrule really feels alive in this game and that has everything to do with sound design.

1407
01:58:25,808 --> 01:58:29,590
So on behalf of Mr. Wakai and his team, thank you so much.

1408
01:58:42,422 --> 01:58:45,805
Tonight's fourth nominee for Game of the Year,

1409
01:58:45,805 --> 01:58:47,948
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds,

1410
01:58:47,948 --> 01:58:51,192

1411
01:58:51,192 --> 01:58:58,880
Chang Han Kim, Brendan Green, Tae Seok Jang, Chang Ho Lee.

1412
01:59:16,598 --> 01:59:18,039
Let's give it up for Nintendo Girl.

1413
01:59:18,039 --> 01:59:27,084
No, seriously, he's really cool.

1414
01:59:27,084 --> 01:59:28,886
Art direction is a miracle.

1415
01:59:28,886 --> 01:59:31,347
The ability to pluck ideas from one's brain

1416
01:59:31,347 --> 01:59:34,429
and bring them to life on screen is truly amazing.

1417
01:59:34,429 --> 01:59:38,151
That this happens in the crucible of game development,

1418
01:59:38,151 --> 01:59:42,814
where a team's vision is often at odds with the game engine,

1419
01:59:42,814 --> 01:59:45,296
schedule, budget.

1420
01:59:46,413 --> 01:59:53,475
the producer, your mom, means that when everything does come together, it is a sight to behold.

1421
01:59:53,475 --> 02:00:02,038
Who can forget the first time they saw games like Inside, Firewatch, or The Witness?

1422
02:00:02,038 --> 02:00:07,779
Truly beautiful games whose visuals serve to complement or even amplify all the other

1423
02:00:07,779 --> 02:00:10,520
elements of the gameplay experience inside them.

1424
02:00:11,270 --> 02:00:16,552
This year's batch of nominees for Best Visual Art are no different.

1425
02:00:16,552 --> 02:00:20,675
Here are the nominees.

1426

Sven Ruttnar.

1443
02:01:37,403 --> 02:01:40,230
There should really be five envelopes here,

1444
02:01:40,230 --> 02:01:41,914
so I'm only gonna open the one,

1445
02:01:41,914 --> 02:01:42,916
but it's a really tough category.

1446
02:01:42,916 --> 02:01:47,246
Winner for best visual art goes to Cuphead.

1447
02:02:23,502 --> 02:02:28,386
Thanks to everybody that believed in our crazy little game and supported us, because of course,

1448
02:02:28,386 --> 02:02:35,290
without you buying it, Chad and Jared would now be in crippling debt forever.

1449
02:02:35,290 --> 02:02:40,013
I'd like to give a shout out to all the other artists that couldn't make it to the stage

1450
02:02:40,013 --> 02:02:40,174
today.

1451

and of course, Chad Moldenhauer,

1454
02:02:49,597 --> 02:02:52,218
who single-handedly animated and designed

1455
02:02:52,218 --> 02:02:54,399
the very first trailer that caught the eyes

1456
02:02:54,399 --> 02:02:56,420
and imaginations of so many of you.

1457
02:02:56,420 --> 02:02:57,221
Thank you all.

1458
02:03:11,753 --> 02:03:16,474
Sweetheart, boobie, you wanna invest in the future of video games, take it from me, okay?

1459
02:03:16,474 --> 02:03:23,396
Nobody's gonna wanna spend $300 on a home console when they could put a couple of quarters in at the arcade, am I right?

1460
02:03:23,396 --> 02:03:24,416
Just one second, daddy needs a bump.

1461
02:03:24,416 --> 02:03:32,058
Pwa ha ha ha ha ha!

1462
02:03:32,058 --> 02:03:32,838
What the fuck?

1463
02:03:34,808 --> 02:03:38,010
You wanna waste your time with a playing card company?

1464
02:03:38,010 --> 02:03:38,810
Nintendo?

1465
02:03:38,810 --> 02:03:42,111
More like Nintendon't waste my money, am I right?

1466
02:03:42,111 --> 02:03:45,032
Look, this is what you wanna invest in, okay?

1467
02:03:45,032 --> 02:03:48,573
I just got a box of mint-kindish copies

1468
02:03:48,573 --> 02:03:49,533
of E.T. for the Atari 2600.

1469
02:03:49,533 --> 02:03:51,734
That's right, the Spielberg picture.

1470
02:03:51,734 --> 02:03:54,755
So how many can I put you down for?

1471
02:03:54,755 --> 02:03:58,796
One second, let me pop these ludes.

1472
02:03:58,796 --> 02:03:59,196
So, are we in business?

1473
02:03:59,196 --> 02:03:59,397
Say what?

1474
02:04:03,769 --> 02:04:06,411
Look, just roll with me on this one, okay?

1475
02:04:06,411 --> 02:04:09,994
The only way to tell stories in games is through cutscenes, alright?

1476
02:04:09,994 --> 02:04:11,334
I bet my life on it.

1477
02:04:11,334 --> 02:04:11,555
Shit.

1478
02:04:11,555 --> 02:04:11,835
Okay, look.

1479
02:04:11,835 --> 02:04:17,319
I know I haven't always been right, okay?

1480
02:04:17,319 --> 02:04:22,923
But what I know for sure is that gamers love good graphics and a linear story, okay?

1481
02:04:27,030 --> 02:04:29,131
Take your shit and get out!

1482
02:04:29,131 --> 02:04:30,752
I'm keeping the house.

1483
02:04:30,752 --> 02:04:33,714
Baby, wait, please, baby, just give me a second.

1484
02:04:33,714 --> 02:04:35,575
Just, I'll, look, do not invest in mobile games,

1485
02:04:35,575 --> 02:04:36,375
whatever you do.

1486
02:04:36,375 --> 02:04:38,576
Shh, baby, listen to me, listen to me, okay?

1487
02:04:38,576 --> 02:04:42,979
You cannot do free to play.

1488
02:04:42,979 --> 02:04:47,741
You have to charge at least 50 bucks up front

1489
02:04:47,741 --> 02:04:51,323
if you want to snowball's chance in hell

1490
02:04:51,323 --> 02:04:53,284
of making your money back, okay?

1491
02:04:58,937 --> 02:05:01,939
Don Giovanni sends his regards.

1492
02:05:01,939 --> 02:05:03,360
No, no, no, please, I'll get you the money!

1493
02:05:03,360 --> 02:05:06,423
Consoles need cutting-edge hardware!

1494
02:05:06,423 --> 02:05:07,444
It's all anybody cares about!

1495
02:05:07,444 --> 02:05:08,905
All right, everyone, come get your Wii's.

1496
02:05:08,905 --> 02:05:09,285
Whoa!

1497
02:05:09,285 --> 02:05:09,425
Whoa!

1498
02:05:09,425 --> 02:05:09,665
Whoa!

1499
02:05:09,665 --> 02:05:09,846
Whoa!

1500
02:05:09,846 --> 02:05:10,046
Whoa!

1501
02:05:10,046 --> 02:05:10,226
Whoa!

1502
02:05:10,226 --> 02:05:11,127
Whoa!

1503
02:05:11,127 --> 02:05:16,891
Whoa!

1504
02:05:16,891 --> 02:05:20,734
Whoa!

1505
02:05:20,734 --> 02:05:21,055
Whoa!

1506
02:05:21,055 --> 02:05:21,355
Whoa!

1507
02:05:21,355 --> 02:05:21,855
Whoa!

1508
02:05:21,855 --> 02:05:22,616
Whoa!

1509
02:05:22,616 --> 02:05:23,136
Whoa!

1510
02:05:23,136 --> 02:05:23,817
Whoa!

1511
02:05:23,817 --> 02:05:24,377
Whoa!

1512
02:05:24,377 --> 02:05:24,918
Whoa!

1513
02:05:24,918 --> 02:05:25,638
Whoa!

1514
02:05:36,299 --> 02:05:38,240
That's all here for all that great advice.

1515
02:05:38,240 --> 02:05:43,721
Designers are often seen as the rock stars of our industry.

1516
02:05:43,721 --> 02:05:48,302
The designer is the creative force of a project that does

1517
02:05:48,302 --> 02:05:54,604
most of the press and gets to make all sorts of glamorous

1518
02:05:54,604 --> 02:05:58,665
decisions on the features and the feel and the tone that go

1519
02:05:58,665 --> 02:06:00,245
into the video games that we love to play.

1520
02:06:00,245 --> 02:06:01,106
I look around this room.

1521
02:06:01,106 --> 02:06:04,907
I see a lot of designers I know and trust.

1522
02:06:05,847 --> 02:06:09,369
I've got a couple of questions for you.

1523
02:06:09,369 --> 02:06:14,893
Number one, if your game had only one button in it,

1524
02:06:14,893 --> 02:06:19,296
would you make that button R3?

1525
02:06:19,296 --> 02:06:24,959
Have you ever, and I mean ever, considered the possibility

1526
02:06:24,959 --> 02:06:27,721
of putting a headphone jack into a child's chest?

1527
02:06:27,721 --> 02:06:33,485
Number three, do you like anime?

1528
02:06:36,285 --> 02:06:39,386
If you answered yes to all these questions,

1529
02:06:39,386 --> 02:06:42,047
then you're actually Kojima and your leather pants are on fire.

1530
02:06:42,047 --> 02:06:48,149
For everyone else, thanks for working so hard to make games

1531
02:06:48,149 --> 02:06:50,710
better one failure at a time.

1532
02:06:50,710 --> 02:06:56,592

02:07:38,346 --> 02:07:39,086
Taesuk Jang,

1543
02:07:39,086 --> 02:07:41,007
Changho Lee.

1544
02:07:41,007 --> 02:07:46,708
The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

1545
02:07:46,708 --> 02:07:48,529
Developed by Nintendo EPD.

1546
02:07:48,529 --> 02:07:51,950
Published by Nintendo.

1547
02:07:51,950 --> 02:07:53,931

1552

And the Best Design Award goes to...

1553
02:08:18,551 --> 02:08:23,997
The Legend of Zelda.

1554
02:08:45,123 --> 02:08:46,023
I'm a Nintendo girl.

1555
02:08:46,023 --> 02:08:57,369
I wish I had worn higher heels said no one ever.

1556
02:08:57,369 --> 02:09:03,352
So many aspects of this game's design were remarkable.

1557
02:09:03,352 --> 02:09:09,615
From the massive world that the developers built to the open-air game structure that

1558
02:09:10,475 --> 02:09:16,159
literally tore down Zelda standards and gave players absolute freedom.

1559
02:09:16,159 --> 02:09:19,560
And all of it really comes down to a singular vision and

1560
02:09:19,560 --> 02:09:23,142
we are beyond happy that it connected with so so many people.

1561
02:09:23,142 --> 02:09:27,225
Thank you so much on behalf of Mr. Aonuma

1562
02:09:27,225 --> 02:09:30,606
and Mr. Fujibayashi and the entire Zelda team.

1563
02:09:43,277 --> 02:09:47,421
And now our fifth and final nominee for Game of the Year,

1564
02:09:47,421 --> 02:09:49,402
Horizon Zero Dawn.

1565
02:09:49,402 --> 02:09:52,665
Developed by Guerrilla Games.

1566
02:09:52,665 --> 02:09:56,087
Published by Sony Interactive Entertainment.

1567
02:09:56,087 --> 02:09:57,088
Praying won't save us.

1568
02:09:57,088 --> 02:09:58,770
The Guerrilla Team.

1569
02:09:58,770 --> 02:10:03,173
So you will have to leave the sacred land.

1570
02:10:03,173 --> 02:10:04,955
Where the trail leads, I will go.

1571
02:10:20,611 --> 02:10:26,876
To be totally honest with y'all, it's pretty hard for me to stand up here and give an award

1572
02:10:26,876 --> 02:10:28,657
away for VR.

1573
02:10:28,657 --> 02:10:34,421
Because most early titles on new platforms are glorified tech demos plus shooting, which

1574
02:10:34,421 --> 02:10:35,862
I kind of fucking detest.

1575
02:10:35,862 --> 02:10:44,929
At the same time, I just self-published an artsy-fartsy VR fairy tale about a little

1576
02:10:44,929 --> 02:10:47,891
bird who swallows the last piece of the waning moon, so...

1577
02:10:50,484 --> 02:10:54,788
You clearly should not come to me for advice about what will sell.

1578
02:10:54,788 --> 02:11:01,873
But all joking aside, I do truly think that someday there will be VR games that expand

1579
02:11:01,873 --> 02:11:05,496
the way that people see our medium, which is an art form.

1580
02:11:05,496 --> 02:11:12,202
And that's why I'm truly hoping that people actually fucking buy VR hardware this holiday season.

1581
02:11:12,202 --> 02:11:15,985
Tonight's VR nominees are...

1582
02:11:17,427 --> 02:11:20,011
Best VR AR game.

1583
02:11:20,011 --> 02:11:25,980
Superhot VR, developed by the Superhot team.

1584
02:11:25,980 --> 02:11:29,265
Tomasz Kaszmarszczyk, Piotr Iwanicki.

1585
02:11:35,857 --> 02:11:43,163
Star Trek Bridge Crew, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, published by Ubisoft.

1586
02:11:43,163 --> 02:11:47,847
David Botipka, Robbie Edwards, Clark Gibson.

1587
02:11:47,847 --> 02:11:59,217
Lone Echo, developed by Ready at Dawn, published by Oculus Studios.

1588
02:11:59,217 --> 02:12:01,219
The Ready at Dawn team.

1589
02:12:05,992 --> 02:12:11,977
Resident Evil 7 Biohazard, developed by Capcom.

1590
02:12:11,977 --> 02:12:19,563
Jun Takeuchi, Koshi Nakanishi, Masachika Kawata.

1591
02:12:19,563 --> 02:12:24,707
The Elder Scrolls V Skyrim VR,

1592
02:12:24,707 --> 02:12:27,709
developed by Bethesda Game Studios,

1593
02:12:27,709 --> 02:12:30,491
published by Bethesda Softworks.

1594
02:12:30,491 --> 02:12:34,595
Todd Howard, Andrew Scharf, Jesse Flanagan.

1595
02:12:38,052 --> 02:12:43,844
This year's winner for VR AR game is...

1596
02:12:43,844 --> 02:12:46,410
Superhot.

1597
02:13:13,463 --> 02:13:13,783
Wow.

1598
02:13:13,783 --> 02:13:15,984
Well, that was unexpected.

1599
02:13:15,984 --> 02:13:19,567
Did you see the other nominees?

1600
02:13:19,567 --> 02:13:23,129
It's actual big brand names this time.

1601
02:13:23,129 --> 02:13:27,752
So I guess, Robin, there's actually hope for VR.

1602
02:13:27,752 --> 02:13:31,354
Somebody's yanked by the headset.

1603
02:13:31,354 --> 02:13:33,616
So well, it's been.

1604
02:13:34,819 --> 02:13:38,280
It's been a pretty wild year for us in terms of VR,

1605
02:13:38,280 --> 02:13:42,682
and I would like to thank pretty much everybody.

1606
02:13:42,682 --> 02:13:45,283
But I will also allow a couple of words

1607
02:13:45,283 --> 02:13:49,524
to our game director, who's currently down with a cold

1608
02:13:49,524 --> 02:13:52,005
at our crummy indie Airbnb.

1609
02:13:52,005 --> 02:13:55,306
At least we think it's cold.

1610
02:13:55,306 --> 02:14:01,729
It's either cold or a typhoid fever from what we've seen.

1611
02:14:01,729 --> 02:14:02,909
So Piotr, say hi to everybody.

1612
02:14:03,747 --> 02:14:05,281
Bye everybody. Thank you.

1613
02:14:16,173 --> 02:14:17,514
The crowd is amazing, Piotr.

1614
02:14:17,514 --> 02:14:18,675
Wish you could see it.

1615
02:14:18,675 --> 02:14:21,876
And I wish that all of the guys back at home in Poland

1616
02:14:21,876 --> 02:14:23,317
will see it as well.

1617
02:14:23,317 --> 02:14:26,919
The creative team is extremely smart.

1618
02:14:26,919 --> 02:14:29,740
And there's, I think, about three dozen of us right now.

1619
02:14:29,740 --> 02:14:32,401
And we hope to stay in the industry.

1620
02:14:32,401 --> 02:14:35,443
And we hope to build more VR stuff in the future.

1621
02:14:35,443 --> 02:14:37,804
So all the Bethesdas and the Ubisofts of the world,

1622
02:14:37,804 --> 02:14:39,125
please keep up the good work.

1623
02:14:39,125 --> 02:14:41,406
We need your customers to buy our games as well.

1624
02:14:49,917 --> 02:15:07,444
Thank you guys.

1625
02:15:07,444 --> 02:15:13,687
And now, to present this year's Lifetime Achievement Award, please welcome to the stage, the producer

1626
02:15:13,687 --> 02:15:16,428
of the Game Awards, Jeff Keighley.

1627
02:15:24,379 --> 02:15:28,141
Hello everyone, surprise. How you doing?

1628
02:15:28,141 --> 02:15:32,463
Alright, well this is a really special moment for me.

1629
02:15:32,463 --> 02:15:37,906
Because back in 2007, Shigeru Miyamoto won the GDC Lifetime Achievement Award.

1630
02:15:37,906 --> 02:15:46,890
And he told Time Magazine that the obvious objective of video games is to entertain people by surprising them with new experiences.

1631
02:15:46,890 --> 02:15:50,892
Tim Schafer is a guy who specializes in the new.

1632
02:15:55,405 --> 02:15:56,005
Tim of Legend!

1633
02:15:56,005 --> 02:16:02,006
Tim of Legend!

1634
02:16:02,006 --> 02:16:05,987
I have been playing Tim's games for so long, since I was a little kid.

1635
02:16:05,987 --> 02:16:08,207
And he specializes in the new.

1636
02:16:08,207 --> 02:16:16,149
He bursts new worlds, brainstorms new characters and architects new experiences, time and time again.

1637
02:16:16,149 --> 02:16:21,010
Tim is one of our gaming industry's most original and creative thinkers.

1638
02:16:21,010 --> 02:16:23,470
He's also, of course, one of the funniest.

1639
02:16:26,053 --> 02:16:32,541
Now, at a time when the breadth and depth of content made by this industry can be misrepresented,

1640
02:16:32,541 --> 02:16:41,812
Tim's fun, colorful, and comedic games are more important than ever.

1641
02:16:44,713 --> 02:16:51,716
Now, I first came across Tim's work when I was very young, about 12 years old, because

1642
02:16:51,716 --> 02:16:58,099
between schoolwork, I'd play LucasArts Adventure Games home in Canada, where Tim got his start

1643
02:16:58,099 --> 02:17:03,861
with a $27,000 a year salary, working on some of the earliest adventure games.

1644
02:17:03,861 --> 02:17:08,203
And of course, there was The Secret of Monkey Island, where he learned about game design

1645
02:17:08,203 --> 02:17:10,884
from the legendary Ron Gilbert.

1646
02:17:10,884 --> 02:17:11,824
Let's hear it for Monkey Island.

1647
02:17:16,098 --> 02:17:22,985
And one of my favorites, Day of the Tentacle, which he designed alongside Dave Grossman.

1648
02:17:22,985 --> 02:17:27,429
I will still always remember the CD-ROM talkie version of Dot,

1649
02:17:27,429 --> 02:17:29,091
and my quest to power up the Chrono-John.

1650
02:17:29,091 --> 02:17:33,655
These are memories from many years ago, but they still stick with me.

1651
02:17:33,655 --> 02:17:37,940
Now, as I played those games, I couldn't quite believe this rich, interactive storybook

1652
02:17:37,940 --> 02:17:40,022
that I could shape with the click of a mouse.

1653
02:17:40,562 --> 02:17:43,963
And, you know, I remember me and my brother playing through those games,

1654
02:17:43,963 --> 02:17:46,504
trying to figure out the puzzles, the inventory items,

1655
02:17:46,504 --> 02:17:50,625
and often resorting to CompuServe to get hints to figure out how to get through

1656
02:17:50,625 --> 02:17:53,966
these incredible games that Tim built many decades ago.

1657
02:17:53,966 --> 02:17:56,946
Now, as Tim's career progressed at LucasArts,

1658
02:17:56,946 --> 02:18:01,548
he started designing his own games like Full Throttle.

1659
02:18:01,548 --> 02:18:01,928
Yes.

1660
02:18:01,928 --> 02:18:07,329
And Grim Fandango, which is celebrating an anniversary this year.

1661
02:18:09,392 --> 02:18:12,494
Now, these seminal games help cement Tim's signature style,

1662
02:18:12,494 --> 02:18:15,235
rich, quirky worlds with funny talking characters

1663
02:18:15,235 --> 02:18:16,975
and challenging puzzles.

1664
02:18:16,975 --> 02:18:20,857
Now, one of the things that I most admire about Tim

1665
02:18:20,857 --> 02:18:22,638
is how over a 30 year career,

1666
02:18:22,638 --> 02:18:25,479
he's never built games based on what genre

1667
02:18:25,479 --> 02:18:27,400
is trending in the market.

1668
02:18:27,400 --> 02:18:30,181
He builds what's in his heart.

1669
02:18:30,181 --> 02:18:31,221
And we love you for it, Tim.

1670
02:18:35,950 --> 02:18:41,434
And Tim has put everything on the line time and again in pursuit of his art.

1671
02:18:41,434 --> 02:18:53,522
Today he runs his own independent studio, Double Fine, right here in San Francisco.

1672
02:18:53,522 --> 02:18:54,463
Home town boy.

1673
02:18:55,582 --> 02:19:01,265
It hasn't been an easy 18 years for Double Fine, but together with his fans and his team,

1674
02:19:01,265 --> 02:19:06,528
they've found a way to fund and support their own games like Psychonauts,

1675
02:19:06,528 --> 02:19:10,310
Psychonauts 2 in production now, and Broken Age,

1676
02:19:10,310 --> 02:19:15,052
and even pay it forward by helping other smaller developers through Double Fine Presents.

1677
02:19:19,805 --> 02:19:25,430
Tonight it is my great honor to present GDC's Lifetime Achievement Award to a friend who's

1678
02:19:25,430 --> 02:19:30,415
built some of this industry's most memorable and new experiences, and on a personal level

1679
02:19:30,415 --> 02:19:34,519
has helped inspire me to devote my career to celebrating games and the people who make

1680
02:19:34,519 --> 02:19:34,739
them.

1681
02:19:34,739 --> 02:19:40,925
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome to the stage Tim of Legend.

1682
02:20:10,386 --> 02:20:21,489
Thank you.

1683
02:20:21,489 --> 02:20:26,791
Thank you. Thank you, buddy.

1684
02:20:26,791 --> 02:20:30,312
Thanks so much. I should.

1685
02:20:30,312 --> 02:20:33,273
Thanks. I got this.

1686
02:20:33,273 --> 02:20:34,613
I got this.

1687
02:20:36,573 --> 02:20:38,113
Under control.

1688
02:20:38,113 --> 02:20:41,314
This is where I feel most comfortable.

1689
02:20:41,314 --> 02:20:43,315
I've hosted these awards many times,

1690
02:20:43,315 --> 02:20:46,995
and I thought I'm super, I'm the master of my domain here,

1691
02:20:46,995 --> 02:20:48,416
this is cool, I got this.

1692
02:20:48,416 --> 02:20:50,876
And then Jeff makes me feel like a blubbering idiot

1693
02:20:50,876 --> 02:20:54,017
with his little, yeah, but yeah, and all of you.

1694
02:20:54,017 --> 02:20:57,078
Thank you so much, thanks, thanks Jeff.

1695
02:21:02,011 --> 02:21:02,892
Thank you.

1696
02:21:02,892 --> 02:21:03,893
Thank you, everybody.

1697
02:21:03,893 --> 02:21:05,054
Thanks, everybody, here.

1698
02:21:05,054 --> 02:21:07,056
Thanks, everyone, at GDC.

1699
02:21:07,056 --> 02:21:15,064
Thanks to Simon and Katie and the spooky ghost of Megan Scavio.

1700
02:21:15,064 --> 02:21:16,746
Thanks, everyone, at Table 8.

1701
02:21:16,746 --> 02:21:18,288
Yeah, Table 8.

1702
02:21:18,288 --> 02:21:20,009
Everybody in the back, thank you.

1703
02:21:21,727 --> 02:21:23,188
Thank you so much.

1704
02:21:23,188 --> 02:21:26,749
This is a tremendous honor, and I'm incredibly humbled

1705
02:21:26,749 --> 02:21:28,590
and happy to be getting this award tonight.

1706
02:21:28,590 --> 02:21:29,691
So thank you.

1707
02:21:29,691 --> 02:21:33,152
I know what a lot of you are thinking.

1708
02:21:33,152 --> 02:21:36,954
How can I give this award to this guy?

1709
02:21:36,954 --> 02:21:39,375
He's so young.

1710
02:21:40,587 --> 02:21:46,051
But I'll have you know, the truth is, I've been, as Jeff spoiled, you know, in this industry almost 30 years.

1711
02:21:46,051 --> 02:21:55,358
To set that time in a particular place, when I started in the games industry in 1989, the Berlin Wall was still standing.

1712
02:21:55,358 --> 02:22:07,427
And then I started making games, and then the Berlin Wall fell.

1713
02:22:07,427 --> 02:22:09,549
Yeah. Great. Yes.

1714
02:22:10,586 --> 02:22:11,525
So you're welcome.

1715
02:22:13,655 --> 02:22:18,576
I'm not saying I did it all by myself, and I've got to thank a few people for that.

1716
02:22:18,576 --> 02:22:25,717
Much like my time at games, I've been incredibly lucky a lot of times, and I realized as I

1717
02:22:25,717 --> 02:22:29,778
was writing this, it's like a list of times when I should have died, and I didn't.

1718
02:22:29,778 --> 02:22:34,639
And I've got to thank all the people who helped me with that.

1719
02:22:34,639 --> 02:22:40,440
I've been so lucky in the just amazing people I've crossed paths with along the way.

1720
02:22:41,569 --> 02:22:51,195
I started my career in the industry at a company then called Lucasfilm Games, and David Fox

1721
02:22:51,195 --> 02:22:58,100
had no reason to hire me, especially after in my interview I totally accidentally confessed

1722
02:22:58,100 --> 02:22:59,241
to pirating Ballblazer.

1723
02:23:01,181 --> 02:23:04,245
But he did, and I'm so grateful for everything that happened after.

1724
02:23:04,245 --> 02:23:08,509
And I want to thank Noah Faustine for giving me a crash course in programming AI

1725
02:23:08,509 --> 02:23:10,892
so that I could write the ship combat in Monkey Island.

1726
02:23:10,892 --> 02:23:13,095
And I want to thank Ron Gilbert for cutting the ship combat in Monkey Island.

1727
02:23:13,095 --> 02:23:13,155
Yep.

1728
02:23:13,155 --> 02:23:13,495
Thank you.

1729
02:23:13,495 --> 02:23:13,695
Thank you.

1730
02:23:13,695 --> 02:23:14,036
Thank you.

1731
02:23:14,036 --> 02:23:14,396
Thank you.

1732
02:23:14,396 --> 02:23:14,757
Thank you.

1733
02:23:14,757 --> 02:23:14,957
Thank you.

1734
02:23:14,957 --> 02:23:15,117
Thank you.

1735
02:23:15,117 --> 02:23:15,297
Thank you.

1736
02:23:15,297 --> 02:23:15,498
Thank you.

1737
02:23:15,498 --> 02:23:18,701
Thank you.

1738
02:23:18,701 --> 02:23:18,881
Thank you.

1739
02:23:18,881 --> 02:23:19,122
Thank you.

1740
02:23:19,122 --> 02:23:19,282
Thank you.

1741
02:23:19,282 --> 02:23:19,442
Thank you.

1742
02:23:22,522 --> 02:23:25,766
I assume because it was so good that he couldn't beat it.

1743
02:23:25,766 --> 02:23:29,550
I'm really grateful for Ron for picking me and Dave Grossman to work on Monkey Island,

1744
02:23:29,550 --> 02:23:32,233
Secret of Monkey Island, my first gig in games.

1745
02:23:32,233 --> 02:23:36,538
I learned a lot from Ron, and I especially had to stop worrying and stop censoring my

1746
02:23:36,538 --> 02:23:37,419
own ideas.

1747
02:23:37,419 --> 02:23:38,341
I wrote a joke.

1748
02:23:39,302 --> 02:23:41,604
really quickly about a three-headed monkey.

1749
02:23:41,604 --> 02:23:43,365
And Ron came out to see it and I was like,

1750
02:23:43,365 --> 02:23:44,687
don't worry, that's temporary dialogue,

1751
02:23:44,687 --> 02:23:46,748
I'm gonna take out the three-headed monkey joke.

1752
02:23:46,748 --> 02:23:48,210
And Ron's like, no, we're keeping it.

1753
02:23:48,210 --> 02:23:49,831
And in fact, we're gonna have Steve Russell

1754
02:23:49,831 --> 02:23:51,573
draw a three-headed monkey, it's gonna be great.

1755
02:23:51,573 --> 02:23:52,554
And I was like, what?

1756
02:23:52,554 --> 02:23:55,557
And then it really is like a profound moment for me

1757
02:23:55,557 --> 02:23:56,918
to realize that...

1758
02:23:57,718 --> 02:24:02,640
Me, like everybody is so creative and one of our biggest problems is just how much we censor ourselves.

1759
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:06,201
How much we like, that's too silly, that's too ridiculous, I can't share that with people.

1760
02:24:06,201 --> 02:24:09,681
And that experience made me realize that I should just let it out.

1761
02:24:09,681 --> 02:24:13,162
And that's formed the tone of everything I've made ever since.

1762
02:24:13,162 --> 02:24:19,744
So thanks Ron for that.

1763
02:24:21,865 --> 02:24:25,768
Thanks also to Dave Grossman for pushing me to be a better writer just by sitting next

1764
02:24:25,768 --> 02:24:28,950
to me and writing such amazing dialogue in the next desk.

1765
02:24:28,950 --> 02:24:33,774
I want to thank, how lucky was I to work down the hallway from Hal Barwood, the director

1766
02:24:33,774 --> 02:24:35,575
of Corvette Summer, right?

1767
02:24:35,575 --> 02:24:39,538
Right down the hallway, who taught me when I was whining about how I had to cut the dialogue

1768
02:24:39,538 --> 02:24:41,279
down by half and he was like, just do it.

1769
02:24:41,279 --> 02:24:45,142
And he taught me how to edit my own dialogue and not worry about it, and it's the greatest

1770
02:24:45,142 --> 02:24:46,163
lesson I ever learned.

1771
02:24:46,163 --> 02:24:48,265
Be ruthless when editing your own dialogue.

1772
02:24:48,265 --> 02:24:48,705
Oh my God.

1773
02:24:49,325 --> 02:24:58,093
I want to thank all the great people and smart people in LucasArts upper management, Lucy Bradshaw, and...

1774
02:24:58,093 --> 02:25:02,257
Well, that's it.

1775
02:25:02,257 --> 02:25:03,378
Sorry, team.

1776
02:25:03,378 --> 02:25:11,625
I have been lucky enough to work with the best artists in the industry, Peter Chan, Larry Ahern, Peter Sakel, Scott Campbell, Lee Petty, and others!

1777
02:25:12,577 --> 02:25:18,965
See? I've met amazing composers, Michael Lang, Kumpa Jekian, and sitting over here at table 8,

1778
02:25:18,965 --> 02:25:23,891
the man who's scored almost every game I've ever made, Peter McConnell, right there.

1779
02:25:23,891 --> 02:25:28,276
Special thanks to you, Peter.

1780
02:25:30,475 --> 02:25:34,118
I want to thank all the amazing people who make all my dialogue sound so much better

1781
02:25:34,118 --> 02:25:34,879
than it is.

1782
02:25:34,879 --> 02:25:38,682
The amazing actors I've worked with, and the amazing producers and directors and casting

1783
02:25:38,682 --> 02:25:42,805
agents back at LucasArts, Cameron Nealio, Dara Farrow, and especially Chris Brown, who's

1784
02:25:42,805 --> 02:25:43,926
also sitting right here.

1785
02:25:43,926 --> 02:25:45,087
Chris Brown, thank you so much.

1786
02:25:47,343 --> 02:25:53,967
I've worked with Chris since like 1992 or like 1850, I don't remember.

1787
02:25:53,967 --> 02:25:59,451
She can like cast, direct, and edit and somehow convince movie stars to work for indie game

1788
02:25:59,451 --> 02:26:01,593
rates and it's amazing and I owe her so much.

1789
02:26:01,593 --> 02:26:02,133
Thank you, Chris.

1790
02:26:02,133 --> 02:26:06,816
I want to thank everybody, but I'm sorry, I'm running out of time.

1791
02:26:06,816 --> 02:26:08,277
Thanks to the amazing animators.

1792
02:26:08,277 --> 02:26:08,758
I love animators.

1793
02:26:08,758 --> 02:26:13,421
Thank the amazing programmers and the testers and the producers I've worked with.

1794
02:26:13,421 --> 02:26:16,203
Thank heaven help all the producers who have to keep me on schedule.

1795
02:26:20,775 --> 02:26:23,356
By the way, we're hiring producers right now, so forget I said that.

1796
02:26:23,356 --> 02:26:24,976
It's great to work with me as a producer.

1797
02:26:24,976 --> 02:26:29,257
Thanks to all the publishers we work with.

1798
02:26:29,257 --> 02:26:31,758
And we work with just about all of them.

1799
02:26:31,758 --> 02:26:34,018
But I want to call out one in particular.

1800
02:26:34,018 --> 02:26:36,859
When Psychonauts was canceled, we took it around to get it re-signed,

1801
02:26:36,859 --> 02:26:39,199
and everybody passed on it.

1802
02:26:39,199 --> 02:26:42,720
Everybody.

1803
02:26:42,720 --> 02:26:44,040
Not that I'm bitter.

1804
02:26:44,040 --> 02:26:45,841
That's what this is about.

1805
02:26:45,841 --> 02:26:47,221
We're going to settle some scores.

1806
02:26:47,221 --> 02:26:47,781
No, I'm kidding.

1807
02:26:49,561 --> 02:26:51,142
I want to call out one in particular.

1808
02:26:51,142 --> 02:26:53,443
We would have gone out of business in 2004 if it wasn't

1809
02:26:53,443 --> 02:26:56,085
for a little family operation in Jersey called Majesco.

1810
02:26:56,085 --> 02:26:57,426
So I want to thank the Sutton family

1811
02:26:57,426 --> 02:27:01,908
for helping us out with that.

1812
02:27:01,908 --> 02:27:03,829
Jesse and Joey and all the Suttons.

1813
02:27:03,829 --> 02:27:11,074
Also thanking us through that really trying time

1814
02:27:11,074 --> 02:27:13,475
with Seamus Blackley and all his cohorts at CAA.

1815
02:27:13,475 --> 02:27:15,176
It was really great to have someone

1816
02:27:15,176 --> 02:27:17,818
on our side during a horrible experience like that.

1817
02:27:17,818 --> 02:27:18,938
And I want to thank...

1818
02:27:19,737 --> 02:27:21,278
Okay, wait, now, I have to tell a story now.

1819
02:27:21,278 --> 02:27:25,502
I asked for permission to tell a story and I didn't get permission, but then that bartender

1820
02:27:25,502 --> 02:27:30,806
over there served me four shots of tequila, so.

1821
02:27:33,740 --> 02:27:37,902
In between getting canceled and getting signed by Majesco,

1822
02:27:37,902 --> 02:27:40,003
there was a long period we didn't have any money,

1823
02:27:40,003 --> 02:27:41,344
and we ran out of money.

1824
02:27:41,344 --> 02:27:44,005
And I had to make a talk to the whole company

1825
02:27:44,005 --> 02:27:46,206
and tell them that the next payroll was not coming,

1826
02:27:46,206 --> 02:27:47,807
and there were 30 people who were like,

1827
02:27:47,807 --> 02:27:49,328
we've been crunching on a game for four years,

1828
02:27:49,328 --> 02:27:50,269
and now it's gonna disappear,

1829
02:27:50,269 --> 02:27:53,290
and no one will ever know that this company ever existed.

1830
02:27:53,290 --> 02:27:55,692
Which is hilarious if you've ever been in that position,

1831
02:27:55,692 --> 02:27:56,152
it's really fun.

1832
02:28:01,151 --> 02:28:05,895
So I thought, hey, I was really desperate, and there was one lifeline I could call.

1833
02:28:05,895 --> 02:28:09,919
I had a friend who had sold his company to EA, and I thought he might be able to make

1834
02:28:09,919 --> 02:28:11,340
that kind of loan.

1835
02:28:11,340 --> 02:28:14,843
I hated to do it, but I called him and I said, I hate to ask you, but if you lend me that

1836
02:28:14,843 --> 02:28:16,805
money, I'll give you like 10% of my company.

1837
02:28:16,805 --> 02:28:18,206
Oh my God, please help us out.

1838
02:28:18,206 --> 02:28:19,828
And he said, I'll think about it.

1839
02:28:19,828 --> 02:28:22,831
I'll go talk to our lawyers, and I'll see if I can do that.

1840
02:28:23,446 --> 02:28:30,912
And I sat there at my desk and it was just, I chewed off all my fingernails and then he called back and he's like,

1841
02:28:30,912 --> 02:28:35,016
my lawyer's telling me I can't take stock in another game company.

1842
02:28:35,016 --> 02:28:36,958
So, I'm just gonna give you the money.

1843
02:28:36,958 --> 02:28:39,340
And I lent you the money and it was amazing.

1844
02:28:39,340 --> 02:28:41,361
It was just, it had such an effect on me.

1845
02:28:41,361 --> 02:28:50,229
It's just that I was...

1846
02:28:51,524 --> 02:28:59,757
I was so embarrassed and desperate to make that call and just to be met with that kind of generosity

1847
02:28:59,757 --> 02:28:59,957
um

1848
02:28:59,957 --> 02:29:03,282
Anyway, anyway, um, it struck me and so to this day

1849
02:29:03,282 --> 02:29:05,906
Thank you

1850
02:29:05,906 --> 02:29:06,387
Thank you

1851
02:29:19,356 --> 02:29:23,917
And so Tuesday, if you play one of my games, you'll see special thanks to Will Wright.

1852
02:29:23,917 --> 02:29:24,497
And I want to thank Will.

1853
02:29:24,497 --> 02:29:24,898
It's nice.

1854
02:29:24,898 --> 02:29:36,721
Thanks, Will.

1855
02:29:36,721 --> 02:29:40,822
I hope it's okay if I told that story, but no one else got to ask him for money, I swear.

1856
02:29:40,822 --> 02:29:41,222
Don't do it.

1857
02:29:44,288 --> 02:29:48,089
It really struck me and it motivates me to do whenever I try to, I really want to help

1858
02:29:48,089 --> 02:29:51,271
people as best as I can because I remember how that felt to be in that position.

1859
02:29:51,271 --> 02:29:59,974
Anyway, we didn't go out of business and we're still here 18 years later.

1860
02:29:59,974 --> 02:30:05,136
There are a lot of double finers here in the audience tonight.

1861
02:30:05,136 --> 02:30:07,117
They're the loud ones in the back.

1862
02:30:07,117 --> 02:30:10,818
Double fine!

1863
02:30:10,818 --> 02:30:11,738
Hey, there they are.

1864
02:30:14,562 --> 02:30:18,146
I want to thank everybody at Double Fine, all the beautiful people at Double Fine.

1865
02:30:18,146 --> 02:30:22,010
A special shout out to the veterans who worked at the company for 16 or 17 years.

1866
02:30:22,010 --> 02:30:27,136
Ray Crook, Dave Russell, Jeff Solis, Kee Chee, Anna Kipnis, Nathan Stapley, and the rest

1867
02:30:27,136 --> 02:30:27,457
of you.

1868
02:30:27,457 --> 02:30:34,284
I want to thank all the new employees too for injecting so much new blood into the company.

1869
02:30:34,284 --> 02:30:35,566
Oh, I broke the trophy.

1870
02:30:46,132 --> 02:30:59,465
I'm so sorry.

1871
02:30:59,465 --> 02:31:02,168
Anyway.

1872
02:31:03,536 --> 02:31:05,156
Thank you, everybody.

1873
02:31:05,156 --> 02:31:07,917
I want to thank also Justin Bailey for boldly going into

1874
02:31:07,917 --> 02:31:10,398
Entrata waters with Fig and taking us and other crowdfunding

1875
02:31:10,398 --> 02:31:11,918
entities on a crazy journey with him.

1876
02:31:11,918 --> 02:31:14,759
And I want to thank a man who, if not the tallest person in

1877
02:31:14,759 --> 02:31:16,839
the games industry, he's the tallest in my heart.

1878
02:31:16,839 --> 02:31:24,441
I want to thank Greg Rice for all the work he does.

1879
02:31:24,441 --> 02:31:25,002
And keep being.

1880
02:31:31,059 --> 02:31:33,320
Not just in keeping Double Fine afloat,

1881
02:31:33,320 --> 02:31:35,040
but also in helping out other indies

1882
02:31:35,040 --> 02:31:36,841
with Double Fine Presents and Day of the Devs.

1883
02:31:36,841 --> 02:31:37,281
Thank you.

1884
02:31:37,281 --> 02:31:45,503
And I want to thank my wife, Rachel,

1885
02:31:45,503 --> 02:31:47,024
who's sitting right there.

1886
02:31:47,024 --> 02:31:52,025
Rachel.

1887
02:31:52,025 --> 02:31:54,066
Yeah, I met Rachel in 2003,

1888
02:31:54,066 --> 02:31:57,007
right before we went into Psychonauts Crunch Mode.

1889
02:31:57,007 --> 02:31:58,707
And I was like, I'm a big time game person,

1890
02:31:58,707 --> 02:31:59,347
it's gonna be great.

1891
02:32:01,529 --> 02:32:02,790
Everything's going to be easy.

1892
02:32:02,790 --> 02:32:06,092
And she has stuck with me through that and through everything that's came after.

1893
02:32:06,092 --> 02:32:06,313
So thank you.

1894
02:32:06,313 --> 02:32:09,695
And I didn't trip on the little hologram stairs, by the way.

1895
02:32:09,695 --> 02:32:11,076
So credit for that.

1896
02:32:11,076 --> 02:32:15,379
And finally, I want to thank all the backers and all the players everywhere

1897
02:32:15,379 --> 02:32:17,480
for not just playing our games, but reaching out to us and letting us know

1898
02:32:17,480 --> 02:32:21,003
that they matter to you, because that has made all the difference.

1899
02:32:21,003 --> 02:32:21,603
And so that's it.

1900
02:32:21,603 --> 02:32:25,166
I want to tell you, even though you gave me this Lifetime Achievement Award

1901
02:32:25,166 --> 02:32:30,410
that I broke, I'm not going to stop making games.

1902
02:32:30,410 --> 02:32:30,770
Because.

1903
02:32:34,595 --> 02:32:34,935
Right?

1904
02:32:34,935 --> 02:32:41,705
Because, uh, because I can't afford to.

1905
02:32:44,062 --> 02:32:47,082
But there's so many memories came up when I was making this list.

1906
02:32:47,082 --> 02:32:50,023
It's easy to look back on all the games and all the ups and downs

1907
02:32:50,023 --> 02:32:53,224
and the roller coaster and the troubles and everything.

1908
02:32:53,224 --> 02:32:56,585
But what I realized when I was making this list is this crazy collection of human beings

1909
02:32:56,585 --> 02:33:02,047
that really makes this experience so meaningful and made it possible and so rewarding.

1910
02:33:02,047 --> 02:33:04,007
So I want to thank everybody.

1911
02:33:04,007 --> 02:33:07,188
That's really what keeps me making games is all these people.

1912
02:33:07,188 --> 02:33:10,929
So I want to thank you again for all your help over the years.

1913
02:33:10,929 --> 02:33:13,170
And I want to thank you again for this generous, generous reward.

1914
02:33:13,170 --> 02:33:13,870
Thank you everybody.

1915
02:33:31,030 --> 02:33:32,651
Cheers to Tim Schafer!

1916
02:33:32,651 --> 02:33:50,522
And Will fucking Wright.

1917
02:33:50,522 --> 02:33:54,925
All right, a little emotional here.

1918
02:33:54,925 --> 02:34:00,308
If we've learned anything over the past few years,

1919
02:34:05,155 --> 02:34:16,861
It's that the collective wisdom of the voting populace

1920
02:34:16,861 --> 02:34:33,689
is an error-free, finely-tuned, victory machine.

1921
02:34:36,509 --> 02:34:41,130
Collectively, we are simply incapable of making a bad choice.

1922
02:34:41,130 --> 02:34:44,591
The board doesn't have shit on us.

1923
02:34:44,591 --> 02:34:54,654
And with that in mind, we turn our eyes to the Audience Award, wherein the same people

1924
02:34:54,654 --> 02:35:06,038
that voted a research submarine, Bodie McBoatface, decide what their favorite game was last year.

1925
02:35:07,809 --> 02:35:22,318
I for one can't wait to find out what we all picked.

1926
02:35:22,318 --> 02:35:23,559
Alright, here we go motherfuckers.

1927
02:35:23,559 --> 02:35:29,082
The audience award goes to Nira Otamada!

1928
02:35:29,082 --> 02:35:29,482
Good choice!

1929
02:35:29,482 --> 02:35:29,703
Thank you.

1930
02:35:29,703 --> 02:35:29,863
Thank you.

1931
02:35:29,863 --> 02:35:30,043
Thank you.

1932
02:35:30,043 --> 02:35:30,203
Thank you.

1933
02:35:30,203 --> 02:35:30,463
Thank you.

1934
02:35:30,463 --> 02:35:32,224
Thank you.

1935
02:35:32,224 --> 02:35:32,805
Thank you.

1936
02:36:24,946 --> 02:36:25,567
Yeah.

1937
02:36:25,567 --> 02:36:36,954
So I didn't think that I'll be able to win an award. So we

1938
02:36:36,954 --> 02:36:40,456
really rushed up here.

1939
02:36:40,456 --> 02:36:46,580
Thank you everyone for giving us a vote.

1940
02:36:46,580 --> 02:36:48,221
Thank you.

1941
02:37:12,596 --> 02:37:17,499
Man, this job just keeps getting better and better.

1942
02:37:17,499 --> 02:37:20,241
All right, it says here on this envelope, Choice Innovation Award.

1943
02:37:20,241 --> 02:37:26,966
While games is a growing business, the community of developers is fairly tight-knit.

1944
02:37:26,966 --> 02:37:33,691
That means that many of you will recognize folks running in tonight's memoriam reel.

1945
02:37:33,691 --> 02:37:40,475
Let's take a moment to note their passing and recognize their contributions.

1946
02:39:36,499 --> 02:40:03,573
What is innovation?

1947
02:40:06,297 --> 02:40:07,898
What's the sound?

1948
02:40:07,898 --> 02:40:08,899
One hand clapping.

1949
02:40:08,899 --> 02:40:14,803
This category is often the place where we put games

1950
02:40:14,803 --> 02:40:22,809
that probably won't sell, but look really fucking cool.

1951
02:40:22,809 --> 02:40:28,133
And also, games about difficult subjects,

1952
02:40:28,133 --> 02:40:32,476
like love, sex, collaboration, and compromise.

1953
02:40:34,310 --> 02:40:41,937
In the end, there's never one clear definition of what pushes the boundaries of our craft.

1954
02:40:41,937 --> 02:40:48,803
However, there can only be one chicken dinner.

1955
02:40:48,803 --> 02:40:58,572
Tonight's nominees for innovation are...

1956
02:41:01,029 --> 02:41:05,473
Gorogoa, developed by Buried Signal.

1957
02:41:05,473 --> 02:41:08,855
Published by Annapurna Interactive.

1958
02:41:08,855 --> 02:41:11,797
Jason Roberts.

1959
02:41:11,797 --> 02:41:18,502
The Legend of Zelda, Breath of the Wild,

1960
02:41:18,502 --> 02:41:22,285
developed by Nintendo EPD.

1961
02:41:22,285 --> 02:41:24,527
Published by Nintendo.

1962
02:41:24,527 --> 02:41:26,228
The Nintendo EPD team.

1963
02:41:30,652 --> 02:41:33,615
What Remains of Edith Finch.

1964
02:41:33,615 --> 02:41:35,997
Developed by Giant Sparrow.

1965
02:41:35,997 --> 02:41:39,399
Published by Anna Purna Interactive.

1966
02:41:39,399 --> 02:41:40,981
The Giant Sparrow Team.

1967
02:41:40,981 --> 02:41:46,325
Everything.

1968
02:41:46,325 --> 02:41:50,228
Developed by David O'Reilly.

1969
02:41:50,228 --> 02:41:52,290
Published by Double Fine Productions.

1970
02:41:52,290 --> 02:41:55,412
The Everything Team.

1971
02:42:00,690 --> 02:42:06,531
Player Unknown's Battlegrounds, developed by PUBG Corporation.

1972
02:42:06,531 --> 02:42:21,014
Chang Han Kim, Brendan Green, Taesuk Jang, Chang Ho Lee.

1973
02:42:21,014 --> 02:42:26,735
The Innovation Award goes to Gora Goa.

1974
02:43:14,461 --> 02:43:29,737
Well, I left my sensible career path in my late 30s and I'm over 40 now and my knees

1975
02:43:29,737 --> 02:43:31,279
hurt.

1976
02:43:31,279 --> 02:43:37,665
So I guess it's never too late to innovate.

1977
02:43:43,785 --> 02:43:51,913
I just want to say that I'm in an extremely lucky position to have contributed to three games in this category.

1978
02:43:51,913 --> 02:44:00,901
So I want to thank David O'Reilly for letting me make sounds to the universe

1979
02:44:00,901 --> 02:44:04,525
and introducing me to the words of Alan Watts, which are life-changing.

1980
02:44:05,465 --> 02:44:09,148
And to Giant Sparrow for also letting me contribute

1981
02:44:09,148 --> 02:44:11,730
to their beautiful narrative experience.

1982
02:44:11,730 --> 02:44:13,331
And Jason, thank you again.

1983
02:44:13,331 --> 02:44:13,751
Alright, thank you.

1984
02:44:13,751 --> 02:44:13,971
Thanks.

1985
02:44:13,971 --> 02:44:14,131
Thank you.

1986
02:44:14,131 --> 02:44:14,251
Thanks.

1987
02:44:14,251 --> 02:44:14,431
Thank you.

1988
02:44:14,431 --> 02:44:14,611
Thank you.

1989
02:44:14,611 --> 02:44:14,892
Thank you.

1990
02:44:14,892 --> 02:44:15,092
Thank you.

1991
02:44:15,092 --> 02:44:15,272
Thank you.

1992
02:44:15,272 --> 02:44:15,472
Thank you.

1993
02:44:15,472 --> 02:44:15,652
Thank you.

1994
02:44:15,652 --> 02:44:16,032
Thank you.

1995
02:44:16,032 --> 02:44:16,733
Thank you.

1996
02:44:16,733 --> 02:44:16,993
Thank you.

1997
02:44:16,993 --> 02:44:17,153
Thanks.

1998
02:44:17,153 --> 02:44:17,774
Thanks.

1999
02:44:17,774 --> 02:44:25,659
Thanks.

2000
02:44:25,659 --> 02:44:26,119
Thanks.

2001
02:44:26,119 --> 02:44:27,420
Thanks.

2002
02:44:27,420 --> 02:44:27,640
Thanks.

2003
02:44:27,640 --> 02:44:30,082
Jake also helps me run SF Indies.

2004
02:44:30,082 --> 02:44:32,523
Shout out to all SF developers in the room.

2005
02:44:35,731 --> 02:44:39,353
He keeps us from never meeting because I'm always so fucking busy.

2006
02:44:39,353 --> 02:44:39,633
Anyway.

2007
02:44:39,633 --> 02:44:46,796
As someone whose team won this award years ago, I have to keep saying that because it's

2008
02:44:46,796 --> 02:44:51,879
the only reason that a publisher would ever give me any money.

2009
02:44:51,879 --> 02:44:57,802
I can say that there is no better feeling than to have been chosen as the Game of the

2010
02:44:57,802 --> 02:45:00,003
Year by all you motherfuckers.

2011
02:45:01,775 --> 02:45:06,098
Yes, the industry is callous and cold-hearted at times.

2012
02:45:06,098 --> 02:45:10,640
Yes, we tend to privilege games with huge budgets and huge sales numbers.

2013
02:45:10,640 --> 02:45:18,084
Yes, we still have a real shortage of games with strong black protagonists.

2014
02:45:18,084 --> 02:45:21,386
But, we're working on that shit.

2015
02:45:21,386 --> 02:45:23,988
I'm looking at you, Campo Santo.

2016
02:45:27,773 --> 02:45:35,496
When all is said and done, what matters the most is that we keep focusing on new designs,

2017
02:45:35,496 --> 02:45:45,559
new technologies, and new stories that open our field to new players who will one day

2018
02:45:45,559 --> 02:45:50,381
grace this stage as developers themselves.

2019
02:45:57,672 --> 02:46:03,154
Every one of us started as a kid playing games.

2020
02:46:03,154 --> 02:46:07,536
And every one of us will start as a kid playing games.

2021
02:46:07,536 --> 02:46:11,098
Let's hear it for all the kids out on the internet right now.

2022
02:46:11,098 --> 02:46:12,699
Internet teens who are playing games!

2023
02:46:12,699 --> 02:46:12,959
Applause

2024
02:46:12,959 --> 02:46:26,205
Once again, here's the recap of all of tonight's Game of the Year nominees.

2025
02:46:27,813 --> 02:46:29,634
Game of the Year.

2026
02:46:29,634 --> 02:46:32,234
PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds.

2027
02:46:32,234 --> 02:46:41,877
Nier Automata.

2028
02:46:41,877 --> 02:46:52,979
The Legend of Zelda Breath of the Wild.

2029
02:47:00,308 --> 02:47:10,553
Horizon Zero Dawn. ♪♪

2030
02:47:10,553 --> 02:47:22,238
Super Mario Odyssey. ♪♪

2031
02:47:22,238 --> 02:47:24,139
You all touched so many hearts this year.

2032
02:47:24,139 --> 02:47:25,839
Thank you for all the hard work your teams did.

2033
02:47:25,839 --> 02:47:29,061
You all deserve a round of applause before I open this envelope.

2034
02:47:29,061 --> 02:47:29,301
Come on!

2035
02:47:38,993 --> 02:47:48,968
Alright, ladies and gentlemen, the 2018 winner of the Game Developers Choice Awards Game of the Year is The Legend of Zelda.

2036
02:47:48,968 --> 02:47:50,971
Come on, Nintendo girl, get up here!

2037
02:48:18,587 --> 02:48:27,449
Wow. Thank you so much. Just beyond a great, really great big thank you, the only other

2038
02:48:27,449 --> 02:48:33,950
thing I really want to say is that this particular Game of the Year award is especially meaningful

2039
02:48:33,950 --> 02:48:40,452
and especially humbling for our developers because they're voted on by their fellow developers.

2040
02:48:40,452 --> 02:48:45,353
So thank you for that.

2041
02:48:50,185 --> 02:48:56,827
Speaking of those guys, I couldn't possibly do this award acceptance justice without their help.

2042
02:48:56,827 --> 02:49:02,088
So let me turn it over now to Mr. Ayanuma and Mr. Fujibayashi. Thank you.

2043
02:49:02,088 --> 02:49:07,890
Hello GDC and gamers everywhere.

2044
02:49:07,890 --> 02:49:18,653
Thank you to all the developers who voted for the Legend of Zelda and Breath of the Wild for Game of the Year.

2045
02:49:19,592 --> 02:49:20,232
It is an honor.

2046
02:49:20,232 --> 02:49:25,398
I would also like to take this opportunity to thank all the games nominated for this award.

2047
02:49:25,398 --> 02:49:30,123
In the Legend of Zelda series, discovery and exploration are two major themes.

2048
02:49:30,123 --> 02:49:42,656
This time, the production of Legend of Zelda, which is different from the previous series, was a journey of discovery and exploration for us.

2049
02:49:44,303 --> 02:49:52,710
We are deeply grateful for the enthusiasm and support we have received from many people for our challenge.

2050
02:49:52,710 --> 02:50:00,236
The Legend of Zelda series has warm fans who have supported us for over 30 years.

2051
02:50:00,236 --> 02:50:08,903
I think that the fact that you have come on this great adventure together with us is a sign of love for the Zelda series.

2052
02:50:09,755 --> 02:50:15,383
The positive reactions we've received so far will continue to give fans new surprises.

2053
02:50:15,383 --> 02:50:20,730
On behalf of the Zelda team and Nintendo,

2054
02:50:20,730 --> 02:50:21,211
Thank you!

2055
02:50:37,135 --> 02:50:39,697
Seriously, how many hours of this game have you all played?

2056
02:50:39,697 --> 02:50:45,720
Let's just really seriously, how many hours of Zelda have we all played?

2057
02:50:45,720 --> 02:50:47,521
This is amazing.

2058
02:50:47,521 --> 02:50:49,983
It's a great franchise.

2059
02:50:49,983 --> 02:50:50,423
All right.

2060
02:50:50,423 --> 02:50:50,863
That is all, folks.

2061
02:50:50,863 --> 02:50:56,626
Award shows are never short enough, and there are never enough trophies to go around.

2062
02:50:56,626 --> 02:51:02,109
And everyone here deserves at least two more drinks than they got while sitting here listening to me talk.

2063
02:51:03,090 --> 02:51:08,611
Once again, it is a huge honor to have been up here and give away these awards to people

2064
02:51:08,611 --> 02:51:15,313
that I know personally have struggled to make this art, to make this industry open and diverse

2065
02:51:15,313 --> 02:51:16,474
and amazing.

2066
02:51:16,474 --> 02:51:21,775
And I want you to just all give a huge round of applause to all of tonight's nominees.

2067
02:51:33,467 --> 02:51:38,990
And since I'm the queen of the universe right in this very moment, I'm gonna ask you all to make great games in 2018

2068
02:51:38,990 --> 02:51:40,871
and for the love of God fucking vote!

2069
02:51:40,871 --> 02:51:47,093
See you all next year.

2070
02:55:26,510 --> 02:55:26,573
You
