1
00:00:05,769 --> 00:00:08,350
This is Controls You Can Feel. I'm Zach Gage.

2
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:10,571
There's a hell of an amazing echo going on

3
00:00:10,732 --> 00:00:12,052
for me, so that's cool.

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:15,574
This is a talk on why tactility matters and

5
00:00:15,634 --> 00:00:18,015
how you can build that into your games, if

6
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:18,836
you're doing touch.

7
00:00:19,236 --> 00:00:21,177
But I'm also talking about kind of any kind

8
00:00:21,217 --> 00:00:24,699
of system. So this isn't just touch. This is,

9
00:00:24,819 --> 00:00:26,319
if you want to make a game for anything

10
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,420
you've never really dealt with, how to think about

11
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:28,941
the controls.

12
00:00:29,661 --> 00:00:31,002
So the first thing is, I gotta say, I'm

13
00:00:31,042 --> 00:00:32,963
not a scientist. I didn't do research for this

14
00:00:33,003 --> 00:00:33,203
stuff.

15
00:00:34,051 --> 00:00:36,793
I'm an artist, and I've worked on lots of different things,

16
00:00:36,933 --> 00:00:38,934
and I've spent a lot of time thinking about interaction.

17
00:00:39,494 --> 00:00:41,556
I've worked on large-scale installations.

18
00:00:41,716 --> 00:00:44,037
I've worked on small-scale iPhone games.

19
00:00:44,538 --> 00:00:45,878
I've worked on weird art games.

20
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,920
I've made chat rooms, or chat software.

21
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:51,822
I've done small installation art.

22
00:00:51,942 --> 00:00:54,404
I've even made aggressive books that take advantage

23
00:00:54,484 --> 00:00:55,664
of how you're interacting with them.

24
00:00:55,845 --> 00:00:57,726
So I've designed and thought about interaction

25
00:00:57,806 --> 00:00:59,847
in literally dozens of different contexts

26
00:00:59,907 --> 00:01:01,188
that are all really weird.

27
00:01:01,632 --> 00:01:02,832
digital and non-digital.

28
00:01:03,432 --> 00:01:09,555
And in my experience, the only thing you really need to do to design quality interaction is

29
00:01:09,615 --> 00:01:13,877
just really pay attention to what you're doing and put in legitimate thought into thinking

30
00:01:13,917 --> 00:01:14,197
about it.

31
00:01:14,718 --> 00:01:17,039
And I have a couple rules that should help.

32
00:01:17,579 --> 00:01:22,521
So when I talk about tactility, I'm in this presentation, I'm not just talking about

33
00:01:23,768 --> 00:01:25,289
you know, what you feel with your fingertips,

34
00:01:25,369 --> 00:01:26,630
which is usually what we think about

35
00:01:26,650 --> 00:01:27,831
when we think about tactility.

36
00:01:27,911 --> 00:01:30,092
I'm talking about the entire physical experience

37
00:01:30,112 --> 00:01:31,172
of interacting with something.

38
00:01:31,212 --> 00:01:34,594
So how you hold it, how your body understands it, everything.

39
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:41,502
So, as far as I can tell, the root of a lot of unsuccessful iPhone control schemes

40
00:01:41,802 --> 00:01:46,705
comes from designers just not realizing that the touch screen is something that they need to design controls for.

41
00:01:47,945 --> 00:01:50,346
And beyond that, you have to design not just good controls,

42
00:01:50,386 --> 00:01:54,388
but you have to design a game that's supportable by the type of controls that you can design.

43
00:01:55,428 --> 00:01:58,270
So, most of us who have been thinking about making games for a while

44
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:00,992
should be pretty familiar with designing control layouts,

45
00:02:01,152 --> 00:02:04,115
as in like designing what buttons on a controller do something.

46
00:02:05,056 --> 00:02:07,758
And because we've been making games with this interface for so long,

47
00:02:07,798 --> 00:02:10,840
it's really easy to forget that that interface was designed in the first place.

48
00:02:11,181 --> 00:02:14,603
And all the games that we make are based on that interface

49
00:02:15,044 --> 00:02:18,307
as much as they're based on any creativity that we're bringing to the medium.

50
00:02:19,003 --> 00:02:23,466
So designing for touch interfaces is really different than just designing what key or

51
00:02:23,506 --> 00:02:27,828
button does what. Just as designing a game for the Wii or the Kinect is really different.

52
00:02:28,729 --> 00:02:33,171
It's the closest you're going to come as a game designer, probably, to designing whole

53
00:02:33,291 --> 00:02:38,994
new physical control schemes. So a long time ago, Nintendo got to invent things like the

54
00:02:39,034 --> 00:02:41,115
B button and the D pad and the Z trigger.

55
00:02:41,673 --> 00:02:44,758
and just like them today when we make touch games we're inventing

56
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:48,645
ways of people physically interacting with our devices which is pretty

57
00:02:48,685 --> 00:02:49,346
exciting i think

58
00:02:51,657 --> 00:02:53,537
And sure, you could say this isn't really worth it,

59
00:02:53,777 --> 00:02:56,018
and just in case for some reason you stood on the line

60
00:02:56,038 --> 00:02:59,119
to get in here and you totally disagree with everything I'm gonna say,

61
00:02:59,739 --> 00:03:02,200
let's just look at a couple of really successful iPhone games.

62
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:05,621
So, Angry Birds, Fruit Ninja, Cannonball,

63
00:03:05,861 --> 00:03:07,721
you've probably seen all of these games.

64
00:03:07,841 --> 00:03:10,042
These all have really successful touch controls,

65
00:03:10,242 --> 00:03:14,383
and I would argue that that's a driving reason why they've been so successful.

66
00:03:14,743 --> 00:03:18,885
Especially things like Fruit Ninja, Cut the Rope, Angry Birds.

67
00:03:21,387 --> 00:03:23,167
And in case you're worried about unique controls

68
00:03:23,207 --> 00:03:25,308
and you think that maybe you won't be able to port your game

69
00:03:25,348 --> 00:03:27,769
if you have unique controls, let's just consider a couple reasons

70
00:03:27,889 --> 00:03:29,050
why that's not a great idea.

71
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,210
So first, you've got to rock with your software

72
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:32,151
when you first put it out.

73
00:03:32,191 --> 00:03:33,971
You can't put out something that sucks

74
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:36,112
and then expect to port it to something

75
00:03:36,152 --> 00:03:37,573
where you'll have easier controls.

76
00:03:38,529 --> 00:03:41,171
You want the best controls in the first thing you put out.

77
00:03:41,771 --> 00:03:44,713
Also, games with unique controls tend to have more success

78
00:03:44,834 --> 00:03:46,155
or be capable of more success,

79
00:03:46,175 --> 00:03:49,057
which is why everything you see on the iPhone store that's popular

80
00:03:49,117 --> 00:03:50,158
either has great controls

81
00:03:50,538 --> 00:03:52,299
or is a copy of something that had great controls.

82
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,262
And the other thing is the iPhone is the mobile console to beat.

83
00:03:56,462 --> 00:03:58,324
Everything's got touch, and it's gonna have touch.

84
00:03:58,404 --> 00:03:59,845
So you can probably port.

85
00:04:00,577 --> 00:04:03,559
Okay, so how do we do this? How do we do this special thing?

86
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,439
So I have two rules.

87
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:08,061
Any new successful control scheme should follow these two things.

88
00:04:08,522 --> 00:04:09,722
One, it needs to be comfortable.

89
00:04:11,223 --> 00:04:14,245
When gestures, when players make gestures or moves,

90
00:04:14,325 --> 00:04:15,746
those things should feel good.

91
00:04:16,566 --> 00:04:17,927
They should probably feel great,

92
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:19,668
but they definitely shouldn't feel bad.

93
00:04:20,516 --> 00:04:22,576
It's really easy to think that a gesture that

94
00:04:22,616 --> 00:04:25,277
doesn't feel very good won't alienate a lot of

95
00:04:25,317 --> 00:04:27,357
people, but it will. And if your gesture feels

96
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:30,478
extra good, that'll get people into your game way

97
00:04:30,498 --> 00:04:32,338
more so, especially if you combine it with a

98
00:04:32,378 --> 00:04:33,939
really awesome thing happening in the game.

99
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:37,219
So pulling back the catapult, the catapult in Angry

100
00:04:37,259 --> 00:04:39,600
Birds feels good. Pulling the trigger in the shooter

101
00:04:39,640 --> 00:04:42,380
feels good. There are reasons why those tropes have

102
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,601
really lasted.

103
00:04:44,461 --> 00:04:46,381
And then the second thing is your control scheme

104
00:04:46,441 --> 00:04:48,482
really needs to inspire confidence in the player.

105
00:04:49,572 --> 00:04:54,614
It needs to provide primary feedback that allows practice players to be 100% confident in their inputs.

106
00:04:54,854 --> 00:04:56,314
And this is a little bit more complicated.

107
00:04:56,774 --> 00:04:59,135
So I like to think that feedback comes in two categories.

108
00:04:59,375 --> 00:05:02,116
Primary, and then an optional reinforcement, and secondary.

109
00:05:02,496 --> 00:05:05,037
And I split them up like this because although they are both important,

110
00:05:05,077 --> 00:05:06,597
they're each important for different reasons,

111
00:05:06,957 --> 00:05:12,119
and you can't compensate for having poor primary feedback with great secondary feedback, or vice versa.

112
00:05:12,816 --> 00:05:13,597
So what makes up these?

113
00:05:13,817 --> 00:05:16,659
So primary feedback is information that players get from the body.

114
00:05:16,739 --> 00:05:18,421
This is the tactile information.

115
00:05:18,801 --> 00:05:22,204
And this can be coming from your sense of touch at a thousand frames per second.

116
00:05:22,564 --> 00:05:24,166
It can be coming from your muscle memory

117
00:05:24,246 --> 00:05:26,007
or from your understanding of body position,

118
00:05:26,048 --> 00:05:27,509
which is called proprioception.

119
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:30,051
And the success or failure of this

120
00:05:30,151 --> 00:05:32,253
is based entirely on your game's control design.

121
00:05:32,293 --> 00:05:34,195
And this is where a lot of iPhone games go wrong.

122
00:05:34,315 --> 00:05:37,117
And this is basically what the focus of this talk is going to be.

123
00:05:37,855 --> 00:05:39,957
Then there's kind of an optional reinforcement that can

124
00:05:39,997 --> 00:05:41,838
come from audio cues. So this would be something

125
00:05:41,878 --> 00:05:43,218
like the jump sound in Mario.

126
00:05:44,739 --> 00:05:46,821
And then secondary feedback comes in through the eyes,

127
00:05:46,881 --> 00:05:49,362
and this happens a lot slower at 60 frames per

128
00:05:49,402 --> 00:05:52,084
second or less, depending on the game. And this

129
00:05:52,144 --> 00:05:54,365
is never the solution to primary feedback. I think

130
00:05:54,425 --> 00:05:56,486
probably a lot of you have great skills at

131
00:05:56,526 --> 00:05:58,667
designing secondary feedback, and so I'm not really gonna

132
00:05:58,707 --> 00:05:59,268
talk about that.

133
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:03,722
And the goal of these feedback mechanisms, then, is to convey the game state of, of the

134
00:06:03,762 --> 00:06:08,305
game to the player as fast as possible, so that they can really successfully embody the

135
00:06:08,345 --> 00:06:13,067
character that they are on the screen, or that, if there isn't a character, that the

136
00:06:13,127 --> 00:06:15,028
world that they're interacting with feels real.

137
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:19,550
Essentially, the goal of these mechanisms is to make the action of interacting with

138
00:06:19,570 --> 00:06:24,373
this world as completely invisible as possible, so that the player can spend the most time

139
00:06:24,413 --> 00:06:28,975
thinking about interacting and, with the world and not thinking about interacting with whatever

140
00:06:28,995 --> 00:06:29,575
their device is.

141
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,613
So to illustrate this clearer, we can look at how information is coming when we play Mario.

142
00:06:35,053 --> 00:06:37,335
And if you weren't thinking about control design, you'd probably think,

143
00:06:37,375 --> 00:06:41,158
all right, I'm gonna push right, Mario's gonna move right, I'm gonna push A, Mario will move A.

144
00:06:42,018 --> 00:06:45,401
Or Mario will jump. And this kind of feedback is really important to new players.

145
00:06:45,441 --> 00:06:49,044
This is how they learn the game. They try something, and then they see what happens.

146
00:06:49,384 --> 00:06:52,466
But this visual feedback is actually the secondary feedback.

147
00:06:53,067 --> 00:06:55,328
The first feedback is coming through your fingers.

148
00:06:55,869 --> 00:06:57,610
So when a practice player plays Mario...

149
00:06:58,676 --> 00:07:01,797
She presses right and she knows that Mario will move right before she sees it.

150
00:07:02,537 --> 00:07:04,218
And this is easy to demonstrate.

151
00:07:04,478 --> 00:07:06,839
If I push the A button here, what's gonna happen next?

152
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,980
We don't need to see the next frame to know that Mario's going to jump.

153
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:15,102
And that's really important, to have this intuitive understanding that Mario will jump

154
00:07:15,222 --> 00:07:16,402
when you push the A button.

155
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:19,493
It's because I can feel the button go down.

156
00:07:19,733 --> 00:07:21,675
It's because my proprioception is telling me

157
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:23,096
that my thumb is in the right place.

158
00:07:23,856 --> 00:07:25,718
This all maybe seems kind of obvious,

159
00:07:26,038 --> 00:07:28,320
but just in case you were wondering what would happen,

160
00:07:28,401 --> 00:07:29,021
that's what happens.

161
00:07:30,562 --> 00:07:31,984
And when a novice plays Mario,

162
00:07:32,024 --> 00:07:33,545
they might not be familiar with the controller.

163
00:07:33,585 --> 00:07:34,726
They might not know this stuff.

164
00:07:35,787 --> 00:07:37,088
They might not be able to tell the difference

165
00:07:37,128 --> 00:07:38,810
between the A and B button by their finger.

166
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:43,423
proprioception. They might have to look at the controller a lot and look at the screen.

167
00:07:43,483 --> 00:07:47,187
And this is normal. But the difference is, if you don't have a good controller design,

168
00:07:47,487 --> 00:07:51,910
nobody ever gets past that. They're always looking at the controller. Or even if they're

169
00:07:51,931 --> 00:07:55,874
looking at it ten percent of the time, that's still very novice play and it's not the kind

170
00:07:55,894 --> 00:08:00,117
of thing you want from your game. So this is easy to demonstrate, too. If I'm a novice

171
00:08:00,137 --> 00:08:03,220
player and I'm pushing one of the buttons on the right, what's going to happen? We have

172
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,724
no idea. The only way we can find out is by waiting for our eyes and our secondary feedback

173
00:08:07,744 --> 00:08:08,845
to understand what's going on.

174
00:08:10,721 --> 00:08:12,082
And this probably seems obvious.

175
00:08:12,242 --> 00:08:14,843
Like this is not super complicated stuff.

176
00:08:15,003 --> 00:08:17,804
But the thing that makes it tricky is that it has to be a hundred percent.

177
00:08:17,904 --> 00:08:19,405
It has to work every single time.

178
00:08:19,985 --> 00:08:23,427
So if we go back to the screenshot and we imagine I'm eighty percent sure I'm pushing

179
00:08:23,447 --> 00:08:25,027
the jump button, that's not good enough.

180
00:08:25,147 --> 00:08:25,908
Ninety percent sure.

181
00:08:26,228 --> 00:08:30,310
If I'm wrong, Mario's probably gonna get killed by this Goomba, which would be really embarrassing

182
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,491
in front of all of the friends that I'm playing Nintendo with.

183
00:08:32,911 --> 00:08:34,051
So it's gotta be perfect.

184
00:08:34,391 --> 00:08:35,992
I don't wanna ever be worried.

185
00:08:37,358 --> 00:08:39,339
And so when we take this back to the iPhone context,

186
00:08:39,379 --> 00:08:41,100
you'd be really shocked at how many games

187
00:08:41,160 --> 00:08:42,321
fall into this good enough trap.

188
00:08:42,801 --> 00:08:45,603
So Geometry Wars is a game that uses a virtual joystick

189
00:08:45,623 --> 00:08:47,264
that centers based on your thumb placement.

190
00:08:47,304 --> 00:08:49,325
So you put your thumb down and it's centered.

191
00:08:49,365 --> 00:08:50,505
That's pretty easy to understand.

192
00:08:50,766 --> 00:08:52,186
Sorry, thumbs look really weird

193
00:08:52,226 --> 00:08:53,427
when you take them apart from a hand.

194
00:08:54,968 --> 00:08:57,249
So I move it right, and that's a gesture.

195
00:08:57,730 --> 00:08:58,910
And that's easy to understand

196
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:00,071
because of my proprioception.

197
00:09:00,091 --> 00:09:00,951
I put it down, I moved it.

198
00:09:02,215 --> 00:09:03,756
And the ship follows my movement, right?

199
00:09:03,796 --> 00:09:05,096
That's pretty easy to guess.

200
00:09:05,377 --> 00:09:07,938
I can understand what's gonna happen from the screenshot

201
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:09,799
and just from my understanding of my body.

202
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:12,280
But if I move my thumb to a different position

203
00:09:12,780 --> 00:09:14,621
and we look at the picture and we start to think about,

204
00:09:14,641 --> 00:09:16,302
all right, so now where's the ship gonna go?

205
00:09:16,322 --> 00:09:16,382
And.

206
00:09:18,243 --> 00:09:22,165
Think about how much longer that took you to figure out than when you first moved the

207
00:09:22,205 --> 00:09:22,445
thumb.

208
00:09:22,665 --> 00:09:24,406
And you can try it with your finger in the air.

209
00:09:24,846 --> 00:09:28,527
And the problem here is that we're taking all the benefits that people are gaining from

210
00:09:28,567 --> 00:09:33,690
their proprioception, from their understanding of their body, and we're then mixing them

211
00:09:33,810 --> 00:09:35,531
with this other system, with this spatial...

212
00:09:37,129 --> 00:09:38,470
comparative reasoning system.

213
00:09:38,630 --> 00:09:42,011
And so now instead of a system where we understand everything intuitively,

214
00:09:42,071 --> 00:09:43,792
we have a system where you have to think about it.

215
00:09:44,132 --> 00:09:47,614
And thinking about it takes so long that most players playing this game

216
00:09:47,954 --> 00:09:50,976
will now go back to relying on visuals.

217
00:09:51,976 --> 00:09:53,937
They're gonna go back to that secondary feedback.

218
00:09:53,977 --> 00:09:55,558
They're missing all the first feedback.

219
00:09:56,744 --> 00:09:58,706
and that makes the game a lot harder to play.

220
00:09:58,746 --> 00:10:00,729
And it's not just with these mobile joysticks.

221
00:10:00,789 --> 00:10:02,430
It happens with fixed joysticks too.

222
00:10:02,551 --> 00:10:04,613
So, I have a thumb box here.

223
00:10:04,713 --> 00:10:07,836
That box, where 44 points is coming from

224
00:10:08,016 --> 00:10:11,100
is Apple's guideline for how big a button should be

225
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:13,663
when you're looking at it to be easily pressed is 44 points.

226
00:10:13,763 --> 00:10:14,323
Points are like a...

227
00:10:15,064 --> 00:10:20,067
pixels with DPI. So you could imagine on a phone, 44 points would be 44 pixels. On a

228
00:10:20,127 --> 00:10:24,970
retina device, it would be 88 pixels. It's just size. So they say that that's how big

229
00:10:25,210 --> 00:10:30,353
the box needs to be to be hit. So we can imagine that on a joystick that's fixed, a player

230
00:10:30,393 --> 00:10:34,515
puts his thumb down, there's probably like a 44 pixel variance in where exactly their

231
00:10:34,535 --> 00:10:38,697
thumb position is. And maybe if they're really good, it's just a 22 pixel variance. Maybe

232
00:10:38,737 --> 00:10:42,379
we can make it smaller. So that's half of Apple's research number, and they've done

233
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:43,520
a lot of research on this.

234
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,822
But that's still a ton of directional options for this ship.

235
00:10:47,122 --> 00:10:48,782
For this ship. You can see from the pie chart.

236
00:10:48,822 --> 00:10:50,463
There are all these different places that that could go.

237
00:10:50,743 --> 00:10:52,544
Two of those directions put me into enemies.

238
00:10:52,604 --> 00:10:53,584
One of them is in the clear.

239
00:10:53,704 --> 00:10:55,365
If this is the gun, what am I killing?

240
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:58,026
All this stuff is things that players worry about

241
00:10:58,066 --> 00:10:58,906
where they're playing a game.

242
00:10:59,567 --> 00:11:01,227
And this is all assuming I actually remember

243
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:03,768
the exact location of where that joystick was.

244
00:11:03,888 --> 00:11:05,349
And when you play something for long enough,

245
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:06,910
you forget about that virtual thing.

246
00:11:08,169 --> 00:11:10,151
So how come that works with analog sticks?

247
00:11:10,191 --> 00:11:11,371
How come we don't have this problem?

248
00:11:11,452 --> 00:11:13,973
So with analog sticks, you have a spring in the center,

249
00:11:14,273 --> 00:11:16,095
and you can always feel where the center is.

250
00:11:16,235 --> 00:11:17,836
And the amount of torque on the spring

251
00:11:18,156 --> 00:11:19,737
is how far away you are from the center.

252
00:11:19,797 --> 00:11:21,578
All this stuff was really well thought out

253
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:22,759
when it was originally designed,

254
00:11:23,079 --> 00:11:24,920
and we don't have any of these kind of affordances

255
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,142
when we're dealing with virtual sticks.

256
00:11:27,222 --> 00:11:29,323
All that information that we would normally have gotten

257
00:11:29,363 --> 00:11:32,085
from some mechanical process is coming from inside our body.

258
00:11:33,102 --> 00:11:35,383
So now you might think, like, all right, well maybe it's impossible.

259
00:11:35,423 --> 00:11:36,904
Maybe we can't do virtual d-pads.

260
00:11:37,004 --> 00:11:38,765
And that's not entirely true.

261
00:11:40,286 --> 00:11:42,647
Super Crate Box has pretty good d-pads.

262
00:11:42,727 --> 00:11:44,888
I would argue that you can't do a virtual d-pad

263
00:11:44,928 --> 00:11:47,390
as well as you could ever do, like, real touch controls,

264
00:11:47,410 --> 00:11:48,210
which I'll get to later.

265
00:11:48,370 --> 00:11:50,932
But they do kind of work.

266
00:11:51,452 --> 00:11:54,254
And so we would wonder, all right, so how did they pull this off?

267
00:11:54,294 --> 00:11:56,315
And it turns out it's actually not very complicated.

268
00:11:57,095 --> 00:11:58,956
If Apple's recommending 44 points for a button...

269
00:12:00,688 --> 00:12:03,769
that you're looking at, we would imagine you'd have to be a little bit bigger for one that

270
00:12:03,789 --> 00:12:07,870
you're not looking at. And it turns out that crate boxes are 75 by 75 points, which is

271
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:11,231
a pretty good margin of error. There are only a few buttons. You're not moving your thumb

272
00:12:11,271 --> 00:12:14,792
a lot. And those buttons are only doing one thing. They're not analog joysticks that could

273
00:12:14,812 --> 00:12:19,994
be anything. They're yes or no. And so it turns out that if you have a practice player

274
00:12:20,054 --> 00:12:25,316
who's okay with playing with virtual joysticks, this is, with virtual D-pads, you can be pretty

275
00:12:25,356 --> 00:12:28,817
confident that your actions will be, uh,

276
00:12:30,598 --> 00:12:33,559
portrayed properly when you play this game. That there are people out there who will play

277
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:35,559
this game and it feels comfortable like a D-pad.

278
00:12:37,439 --> 00:12:41,781
Not rocket scientists. Science. This is pretty straightforward. You just have to think about

279
00:12:41,821 --> 00:12:47,382
it. They just made the buttons really big. And if you think about, then, the other thing

280
00:12:47,402 --> 00:12:50,923
that's sort of coming out of this is that there are certain games that you just simply

281
00:12:50,963 --> 00:12:51,823
couldn't do this with.

282
00:12:52,163 --> 00:12:54,964
Greatbox works because you only have two buttons. But if we need 75 point buttons.

283
00:12:57,003 --> 00:12:58,644
a D-pad is just not gonna cut it.

284
00:12:58,945 --> 00:13:00,686
And the other scary thing about a D-pad is,

285
00:13:00,767 --> 00:13:02,128
when you have all those directions,

286
00:13:02,508 --> 00:13:04,190
even if we didn't care that it was taking up

287
00:13:04,250 --> 00:13:05,311
basically the whole screen,

288
00:13:05,531 --> 00:13:07,153
you're asking somebody who's playing it

289
00:13:07,193 --> 00:13:08,234
to move their thumb a lot.

290
00:13:08,514 --> 00:13:09,795
And the more you move your thumb,

291
00:13:09,895 --> 00:13:11,957
the more you forget where things are

292
00:13:12,017 --> 00:13:13,018
that you're not looking at.

293
00:13:13,479 --> 00:13:15,541
So there's a reason that the Jaguar sucked.

294
00:13:15,981 --> 00:13:17,142
That the controller didn't work.

295
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:19,064
You have to look at that all the time.

296
00:13:20,419 --> 00:13:22,020
So let's look at a case study here then.

297
00:13:22,120 --> 00:13:23,481
So we can look at Tetris.

298
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:24,983
Tetris is a really good thing to look at

299
00:13:25,043 --> 00:13:27,725
because they released it and it was bad,

300
00:13:28,125 --> 00:13:30,427
and then I released a game that was kind of based on it,

301
00:13:30,687 --> 00:13:32,628
and then they released a Tetris that was really good.

302
00:13:32,688 --> 00:13:35,350
So we have one bad thing and two good options.

303
00:13:35,991 --> 00:13:37,091
So the original Tetris,

304
00:13:37,912 --> 00:13:39,954
people move, people interacted with this game

305
00:13:39,994 --> 00:13:41,595
by dragging the block left and right,

306
00:13:41,935 --> 00:13:43,856
swiping down, or tapping to rotate.

307
00:13:44,837 --> 00:13:46,378
So if we start with what went well...

308
00:13:46,724 --> 00:13:48,245
But tapping to rotate works pretty well.

309
00:13:48,325 --> 00:13:49,845
Those are basically two giant buttons.

310
00:13:49,925 --> 00:13:52,386
We know that buttons work, and it worked great.

311
00:13:52,706 --> 00:13:53,286
But that was it.

312
00:13:54,267 --> 00:13:55,427
They didn't get anything else right.

313
00:13:55,587 --> 00:14:01,770
Sliding is problematic because the Q, the row, basically the columns are only ten points.

314
00:14:02,331 --> 00:14:05,432
and your thumb is huge, your thumb is 44 point variance.

315
00:14:05,693 --> 00:14:07,874
So you're not moving your thumb very far.

316
00:14:07,994 --> 00:14:09,594
And when you don't move your thumb very far,

317
00:14:09,654 --> 00:14:11,995
it's really hard to intuitively understand that.

318
00:14:12,536 --> 00:14:13,796
There are not a lot of things,

319
00:14:14,597 --> 00:14:16,657
situations in real life where we're only moving

320
00:14:16,717 --> 00:14:17,698
our thumb centimeters.

321
00:14:18,218 --> 00:14:20,479
And so our proprioception isn't really geared

322
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:21,920
to understand that kind of movement.

323
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:27,162
Also, the swiping down is a huge mistake.

324
00:14:27,717 --> 00:14:29,577
Swiping down is not a comfortable gesture.

325
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,477
And this goes back to that comfort thing

326
00:14:31,497 --> 00:14:32,357
that I was talking about.

327
00:14:32,878 --> 00:14:34,538
If you look at Apple's UI, you'll

328
00:14:34,578 --> 00:14:37,218
notice that there's very few situations where you ever

329
00:14:37,298 --> 00:14:37,819
swipe down.

330
00:14:38,379 --> 00:14:40,439
All the menus that you scroll start at the top,

331
00:14:40,499 --> 00:14:41,199
and you swipe up.

332
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,040
And that's because swiping up feels great.

333
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,500
Swiping down feels poorly.

334
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,740
And you can feel that if you try it with your hand.

335
00:14:46,980 --> 00:14:48,241
This is not a comfortable gesture.

336
00:14:48,821 --> 00:14:50,901
And swiping a piece down in Tetris

337
00:14:50,961 --> 00:14:52,201
should be the most exciting thing

338
00:14:52,221 --> 00:14:54,342
you can do, because you do it when you've made a decision

339
00:14:54,382 --> 00:14:55,662
or when you're going to get rid of blocks.

340
00:14:55,802 --> 00:14:56,702
It's going to feel great.

341
00:14:57,142 --> 00:14:59,704
Mixing it with something that feels bad is not a good move.

342
00:15:00,765 --> 00:15:04,327
So the game that I built that was kind of based around that was called Unify.

343
00:15:04,467 --> 00:15:07,309
And I solved a lot of these problems by flipping the phone on its side.

344
00:15:07,609 --> 00:15:11,052
A lot of things are more comfortable when your thumbs are more extended, when you're

345
00:15:11,072 --> 00:15:13,633
holding a larger thing, that you're not cramping your hand around.

346
00:15:14,134 --> 00:15:17,736
So the way that Unify worked is you had two pieces, one on the left and one on the right,

347
00:15:17,876 --> 00:15:20,358
and the bottom row from Tetris was in the middle.

348
00:15:22,928 --> 00:15:25,029
Rotating is just tapping and it felt good.

349
00:15:25,269 --> 00:15:27,550
Sliding pieces up and down feels pretty good because

350
00:15:27,570 --> 00:15:29,711
these rows are so much bigger than those tiny

351
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:30,472
rows in Tetris.

352
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:34,734
And sliding in, actually putting your two thumbs together,

353
00:15:34,974 --> 00:15:36,354
is a really good gesture.

354
00:15:36,614 --> 00:15:37,555
It feels really good.

355
00:15:37,615 --> 00:15:39,636
Players really like it, especially when you put

356
00:15:39,656 --> 00:15:41,497
them together and then blocks blow up off the

357
00:15:41,517 --> 00:15:41,777
screen.

358
00:15:42,277 --> 00:15:43,818
So I got a lot, a lot of mileage in

359
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,059
this game just from that gesture feeling good and

360
00:15:46,099 --> 00:15:47,600
being able to do it over and over again.

361
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:49,180
And I noticed that even in prototypes.

362
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:53,061
The other thing is we added really strong

363
00:15:53,121 --> 00:15:54,462
physical reinforcement sounds.

364
00:15:54,502 --> 00:15:55,823
So the sounds that come in this game

365
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,464
aren't just digital bleeps and bloops.

366
00:15:57,504 --> 00:15:58,405
They're very physical.

367
00:15:58,645 --> 00:15:59,565
They're like clicking.

368
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:01,807
And that makes you feel more like

369
00:16:01,827 --> 00:16:03,328
you're interacting with a physical thing.

370
00:16:05,149 --> 00:16:07,211
So this was a pretty simple set of changes,

371
00:16:07,271 --> 00:16:09,492
but it resulted in a really differently structured game.

372
00:16:09,512 --> 00:16:11,233
And this is a really important point that I want to make,

373
00:16:11,293 --> 00:16:14,335
is don't be afraid to let changes making in your controls,

374
00:16:14,395 --> 00:16:16,237
don't be afraid to let them bleed into gameplay.

375
00:16:16,257 --> 00:16:17,778
It's really important that the gameplay

376
00:16:17,818 --> 00:16:19,039
takes cues from your controls.

377
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,322
So let's look at how Tetris solved this.

378
00:16:21,642 --> 00:16:26,506
So they, unlike, they, they couldn't really do the amount of changes that I did, because

379
00:16:26,546 --> 00:16:29,349
mine resulted in a totally different game that didn't feel like Tetris.

380
00:16:29,429 --> 00:16:31,711
They wanted something that still felt like Tetris.

381
00:16:33,573 --> 00:16:37,876
So they actually did a really good job, and they did it by not being afraid to mess with

382
00:16:37,937 --> 00:16:40,259
some of those really core mechanics of Tetris.

383
00:16:40,439 --> 00:16:43,542
They were trying to hold on to the

384
00:16:44,107 --> 00:16:46,529
core of Tetris, but they could change some of the mechanics.

385
00:16:46,569 --> 00:16:49,932
And so what they did is they have these options of where you can drop a block.

386
00:16:49,952 --> 00:16:51,554
They got rid of the sliding entirely.

387
00:16:51,634 --> 00:16:53,456
Now you just tap where you want to drop it.

388
00:16:54,383 --> 00:16:55,764
And they only give you four options.

389
00:16:55,804 --> 00:16:58,547
And the reason for that is because they need enough pixel

390
00:16:58,567 --> 00:17:00,969
variance so that you can be super confident when you tap

391
00:17:01,009 --> 00:17:03,291
one of these options that you did tap it properly.

392
00:17:03,371 --> 00:17:04,952
That's pretty close to Apple's number.

393
00:17:05,473 --> 00:17:06,394
And it works perfectly.

394
00:17:06,814 --> 00:17:09,176
The other thing that they did is if these aren't good

395
00:17:09,296 --> 00:17:11,398
options, you can tap that cycle button again.

396
00:17:11,778 --> 00:17:13,360
And it will give you four new options.

397
00:17:13,440 --> 00:17:15,401
And it will reset the time that you have.

398
00:17:15,621 --> 00:17:18,704
So you could just keep tapping the cycle button forever and

399
00:17:18,744 --> 00:17:19,545
never drop a piece.

400
00:17:20,314 --> 00:17:23,517
But what they did that was smart is they basically took the time.

401
00:17:23,798 --> 00:17:27,482
It used to be in Tetris you were under time pressure and you were interacting.

402
00:17:27,622 --> 00:17:31,225
And they noticed that the interacting wasn't great, so they separated them out.

403
00:17:31,726 --> 00:17:34,849
They made a non-interactive mode where you're thinking under time pressure.

404
00:17:35,370 --> 00:17:37,071
And then you just make a choice and it works.

405
00:17:37,572 --> 00:17:42,017
And it actually feels a lot more like Tetris than the old terrible version of Tetris.

406
00:17:43,528 --> 00:17:45,029
But OK, no more virtual buttons.

407
00:17:45,069 --> 00:17:46,870
That's not probably why you're here, how

408
00:17:46,910 --> 00:17:47,931
to make good virtual buttons.

409
00:17:48,711 --> 00:17:51,133
So let's look at some games that didn't do virtual buttons

410
00:17:51,193 --> 00:17:51,754
and did good.

411
00:17:52,174 --> 00:17:53,975
Flight Control was a really great example.

412
00:17:54,415 --> 00:17:55,956
Drawing a line feels really good.

413
00:17:56,474 --> 00:17:59,276
the planes are easy to press. You never make a mistake.

414
00:18:00,077 --> 00:18:02,079
But there are some mistakes that you do make in

415
00:18:02,119 --> 00:18:04,261
flight control, and that's when you draw a bad line.

416
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:07,703
But that's not an input confidence. That's the player

417
00:18:07,904 --> 00:18:10,126
just not being skilled enough, which is the kind of

418
00:18:10,166 --> 00:18:11,727
mistake that you do want to make. And they were

419
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:14,809
really smart. They paced their game really slowly so

420
00:18:14,849 --> 00:18:17,972
that you could actually get that secondary feedback.

421
00:18:18,312 --> 00:18:20,014
You could draw a line, and then you could look at it,

422
00:18:20,235 --> 00:18:21,997
and be like, oh, that's not the line I wanted to make,

423
00:18:22,077 --> 00:18:22,778
and you draw it again.

424
00:18:23,138 --> 00:18:24,500
And it's really important to point this out,

425
00:18:24,540 --> 00:18:26,923
because this isn't a decision that they made

426
00:18:27,003 --> 00:18:29,306
because their control scheme wasn't successful,

427
00:18:29,386 --> 00:18:30,787
because players weren't confident.

428
00:18:30,868 --> 00:18:33,591
This is a decision they made to enhance their control scheme.

429
00:18:34,949 --> 00:18:37,010
This is where you have something that works,

430
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:38,850
and then you design your game around it

431
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:40,571
in a way that supports all of the things

432
00:18:40,611 --> 00:18:41,431
that are great about it,

433
00:18:41,991 --> 00:18:43,912
and tries to draw attention away

434
00:18:43,992 --> 00:18:45,052
from the things that are bad.

435
00:18:45,393 --> 00:18:46,753
If this game was really fast

436
00:18:46,833 --> 00:18:48,234
and you had to draw exact lines,

437
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:49,834
it probably would feel terrible.

438
00:18:50,394 --> 00:18:52,875
But that comes from the actual game mechanic

439
00:18:52,975 --> 00:18:54,436
and not from the interaction.

440
00:18:54,616 --> 00:18:58,017
The interaction is actually very successful

441
00:18:58,077 --> 00:18:59,737
and players playing it are always confident.

442
00:19:00,057 --> 00:19:01,578
I don't know if you've ever tapped a plane

443
00:19:01,638 --> 00:19:02,298
and it didn't work.

444
00:19:02,378 --> 00:19:03,559
I've never had that experience.

445
00:19:03,999 --> 00:19:04,759
And that's really telling.

446
00:19:05,692 --> 00:19:07,873
Fruit Ninja's another one that does it faster.

447
00:19:08,514 --> 00:19:10,675
Fruit Ninja, you swipe and it draws a line,

448
00:19:11,615 --> 00:19:14,757
and it feels great, players can understand it.

449
00:19:15,418 --> 00:19:17,619
You get incredibly great visceral feedback

450
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:18,979
because swiping feels good,

451
00:19:19,019 --> 00:19:21,521
and then something blows up every single time.

452
00:19:23,330 --> 00:19:25,071
The other thing that they did, which is as

453
00:19:25,091 --> 00:19:27,232
smart as that strawberry up there, is forty by

454
00:19:27,272 --> 00:19:30,314
forty points. You're gonna see that number everywhere when

455
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:32,695
you start to research this stuff. There's nothing smaller

456
00:19:32,735 --> 00:19:34,496
than that, because something smaller than that would be

457
00:19:34,576 --> 00:19:36,757
really hard to know that you hit it. And

458
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:39,138
the thing that you really want is to build

459
00:19:39,219 --> 00:19:41,940
a game around supporting the confidence that your input

460
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:43,141
is generating in players.

461
00:19:44,882 --> 00:19:46,783
So I have one more. You, you really want

462
00:19:46,803 --> 00:19:50,505
players to blame their reflexes when they lose and

463
00:19:50,545 --> 00:19:52,186
not the game controls. So I have one more

464
00:19:52,226 --> 00:19:52,566
example.

465
00:19:53,030 --> 00:19:55,071
of a game with even faster analog input.

466
00:19:55,411 --> 00:19:56,992
And that's this game BitPilot that I made,

467
00:19:57,012 --> 00:19:59,433
which was really born out of the desire to have an iPhone game

468
00:19:59,453 --> 00:20:02,754
that was really intense, that wasn't slow movement and planning,

469
00:20:02,854 --> 00:20:04,895
where you could actually input it directly

470
00:20:05,095 --> 00:20:07,497
and do these really great sweeping moves,

471
00:20:08,617 --> 00:20:11,238
where you could really become an expert in the controls.

472
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:16,151
And so this might look like a standard twin stick asteroid dodging game, but it's actually

473
00:20:16,192 --> 00:20:16,752
quite different.

474
00:20:16,792 --> 00:20:17,752
So I'm going to show a video.

475
00:20:18,173 --> 00:20:24,216
So the way that this works is that when you swipe on the screen, oh man, that is super

476
00:20:24,256 --> 00:20:24,516
dark.

477
00:20:27,959 --> 00:20:31,260
I may need to adjust, I don't know, is there a way we can turn down the lights slightly

478
00:20:31,301 --> 00:20:31,841
for the video?

479
00:20:32,841 --> 00:20:32,982
No.

480
00:20:34,617 --> 00:20:36,258
Okay, so here you can see the thumbs moving.

481
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,218
So the way that it works,

482
00:20:37,339 --> 00:20:38,739
perfect, thank you,

483
00:20:39,140 --> 00:20:40,661
is you swipe with one of your thumbs

484
00:20:40,721 --> 00:20:42,862
and the force of your swipe is given to your ship,

485
00:20:43,042 --> 00:20:44,603
like in a fraction of the force.

486
00:20:45,123 --> 00:20:46,544
And so if you swipe with two thumbs,

487
00:20:46,604 --> 00:20:48,766
the force of both of your thumbs is given to your ship.

488
00:20:49,166 --> 00:20:50,207
And it's not one-to-one.

489
00:20:50,247 --> 00:20:52,108
It's not like if I move my thumb in a circle,

490
00:20:52,168 --> 00:20:53,729
the ship will move exactly in a circle.

491
00:20:54,229 --> 00:20:56,611
It's a, you're kind of pushing the ship.

492
00:20:57,131 --> 00:21:00,792
And this works in a lot of ways because of the way we think about gestures.

493
00:21:00,832 --> 00:21:03,933
When I gesture, when I, like, I'm gesticulating with talking,

494
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:06,254
I'm not doing something that's very specific.

495
00:21:06,734 --> 00:21:09,095
I'm doing something that's kind of vague. It's sort of a hint.

496
00:21:09,755 --> 00:21:12,816
And so in this game, you're hinting at the ship what you want to do.

497
00:21:12,956 --> 00:21:16,397
But you can make big gestures if you move both your thumbs at the same time.

498
00:21:16,577 --> 00:21:18,478
But really, most of the time, you're just hinting at it.

499
00:21:18,958 --> 00:21:20,739
And because you have to hint at it a lot,

500
00:21:21,039 --> 00:21:23,700
the player has to make a lot of decisions all the time.

501
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,820
And that takes a lot of the stress out.

502
00:21:26,241 --> 00:21:31,207
of what those decisions are, which is really, really helpful.

503
00:21:32,564 --> 00:21:37,685
for the player. And it makes you able to free up your visual perception, to pay attention

504
00:21:37,725 --> 00:21:41,526
to all of these tons and tons of asteroids that are moving, which you would normally

505
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:45,807
not be able to do. If this was a dual stick game, you'd be paying so much attention to

506
00:21:45,847 --> 00:21:49,847
where your ship was and if it ended up where you wanted it to be, that you wouldn't be

507
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:53,308
able to pay attention to how these asteroids are moving. If you notice here, there are

508
00:21:53,388 --> 00:21:57,589
no visual cues as to where those asteroids are going. You actually have to keep track

509
00:21:57,609 --> 00:21:59,869
of them and remember where they were.

510
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:05,011
Okay, so that was a lot of different things that I covered,

511
00:22:05,051 --> 00:22:07,312
and probably you're not going to remember all of them exactly.

512
00:22:07,372 --> 00:22:11,513
So I'll sum it up in a couple ways that should be helpful.

513
00:22:11,993 --> 00:22:13,594
So the first thing, if you're going to do this,

514
00:22:13,714 --> 00:22:15,474
is you need to be flexible with your game design.

515
00:22:15,934 --> 00:22:18,395
You need to understand that games are as much a product

516
00:22:18,535 --> 00:22:22,136
as of the interaction possibilities of the platform

517
00:22:22,176 --> 00:22:23,236
that you're developing for,

518
00:22:24,897 --> 00:22:26,457
as they are of your own creativity.

519
00:22:26,857 --> 00:22:30,539
And it's actually normal and great to let controls

520
00:22:30,639 --> 00:22:32,119
influence the direction of your game.

521
00:22:32,873 --> 00:22:34,134
This is incredibly common.

522
00:22:34,494 --> 00:22:36,116
So a genre that works on a controller

523
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,757
might not be viable on a touchscreen,

524
00:22:37,897 --> 00:22:39,239
might not be viable on a Wii.

525
00:22:39,739 --> 00:22:40,300
That's okay.

526
00:22:42,021 --> 00:22:43,723
The other thing is you need to be really serious

527
00:22:43,763 --> 00:22:44,964
about thinking about these things.

528
00:22:45,524 --> 00:22:46,986
Controls are really important.

529
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:48,787
They're the way that we're interacting

530
00:22:49,007 --> 00:22:50,289
with the games that are playing.

531
00:22:50,449 --> 00:22:52,711
And if you're not paying attention to it,

532
00:22:52,991 --> 00:22:55,093
you're really doing a disservice to all the creativity

533
00:22:55,133 --> 00:22:56,734
that you've put into your game in the first place.

534
00:22:57,598 --> 00:23:01,419
A skilled player needs to be able to know what the input that they give to a virtual

535
00:23:01,459 --> 00:23:03,320
environment will do before they see it.

536
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:07,921
Just like when you walk down the street, you don't hope that you're not going to fall over,

537
00:23:08,101 --> 00:23:08,441
you know.

538
00:23:08,841 --> 00:23:12,022
And that's how we need to be able to interact with everything in a game.

539
00:23:12,302 --> 00:23:17,144
And then the last one is once you have good feeling controls, once you have players who

540
00:23:17,164 --> 00:23:21,085
are confident, you need to make sure your game supports them, that it supports the strengths

541
00:23:21,125 --> 00:23:24,806
of the controls and not the weaknesses, that it integrates those two things well.

542
00:23:25,442 --> 00:23:27,763
So this stuff isn't rocket scientist science.

543
00:23:28,244 --> 00:23:30,265
Well, it's not made by rocket scientists.

544
00:23:31,706 --> 00:23:34,388
And it just requires a little bit of time

545
00:23:34,548 --> 00:23:36,029
and a little bit of experimentation

546
00:23:36,510 --> 00:23:37,570
and these three things.

547
00:23:37,630 --> 00:23:39,111
And when you get it right, there's nothing better

548
00:23:39,552 --> 00:23:41,333
because your controls become invisible.

549
00:23:41,533 --> 00:23:43,434
And instead of concentrating on your controls,

550
00:23:43,695 --> 00:23:45,736
players concentrate on playing the hell out of your game.

551
00:23:46,617 --> 00:23:49,739
Also, these are good points for being a good human being.

552
00:23:49,839 --> 00:23:52,381
That's totally unrelated, but I think it's important.

553
00:23:53,582 --> 00:23:54,382
OK, so thanks.

554
00:23:54,562 --> 00:23:55,083
That's my talk.
