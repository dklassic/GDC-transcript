1
00:00:05,833 --> 00:00:14,446
Today I'm going to talk about a concept that has increasingly consumed my time and energy,

2
00:00:14,446 --> 00:00:16,409
which is the topic of gaming addiction.

3
00:00:18,178 --> 00:00:25,902
And I hope to share what I've learned about it in the last five or so years with you.

4
00:00:25,902 --> 00:00:27,843
So first, who am I?

5
00:00:27,843 --> 00:00:30,764
Well, what am I, I guess? I'm an experimental psychologist.

6
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:37,147
I originally trained as the kind of psychologist that helps people.

7
00:00:38,007 --> 00:00:44,551
But then I was approached by my PhD supervisor who had the idea that maybe we could use empirical

8
00:00:44,551 --> 00:00:49,914
psychology, quantitative psychology to study video games and to study benchmarking and

9
00:00:49,914 --> 00:00:50,814
game development.

10
00:00:50,814 --> 00:00:56,617
So I co-developed the PENs, which is an application of motivational theory to game development

11
00:00:56,617 --> 00:01:00,920
that's a player experience and need satisfaction approach.

12
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:07,563
I'm most interested in behavior, physiology, and human motivation.

13
00:01:09,357 --> 00:01:11,919
And this kind of encompasses kind of small-scale data,

14
00:01:11,919 --> 00:01:14,580
things in the lab, things you'd think of as playtesting,

15
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:18,122
and large-scale or big data following tens of thousands

16
00:01:18,122 --> 00:01:21,363
of people over time with behavioral data,

17
00:01:21,363 --> 00:01:23,444
with trace data, with survey data.

18
00:01:23,444 --> 00:01:27,546
And I'm increasingly interested

19
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:29,407
in evidence-based policymaking.

20
00:01:29,407 --> 00:01:31,308
So basically, if you're a lawmaker,

21
00:01:31,308 --> 00:01:33,109
or if you're a regulator,

22
00:01:33,109 --> 00:01:35,550
or if you're in charge of an education or health system,

23
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:37,171
how do you make a decision

24
00:01:37,171 --> 00:01:38,992
on the basis of scientific knowledge?

25
00:01:39,573 --> 00:01:46,298
about technology specifically in a way that kind of conforms to or harmonizes

26
00:01:46,298 --> 00:01:51,322
with what we know from science. I was also born in 1982 so I'm really in the

27
00:01:51,322 --> 00:01:58,968
sweet spot for having played the original Nintendo and so this was my

28
00:01:58,968 --> 00:02:00,470
present on my seventh birthday.

29
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:03,451
So why am I here?

30
00:02:03,451 --> 00:02:05,732
What are the kinds of things I'm gonna talk about?

31
00:02:05,732 --> 00:02:09,834
Well, I'm sure that everyone in the room

32
00:02:09,834 --> 00:02:13,937
has tiny bits or large bits or chunks of an idea

33
00:02:13,937 --> 00:02:16,258
about what gaming addiction is.

34
00:02:16,258 --> 00:02:17,939
I'm gonna try to cover these five topics.

35
00:02:17,939 --> 00:02:19,480
I'm gonna start by trying to offer

36
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:21,421
somewhat of a historic perspective

37
00:02:21,421 --> 00:02:24,383
on concerns about games and addiction in particular.

38
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:31,394
I'm going to talk about what is the philosophical or theoretical position that's required to

39
00:02:31,394 --> 00:02:39,178
understand what gaming addiction is. I'm going to talk a little bit about the different classes

40
00:02:39,178 --> 00:02:45,582
and the different kinds of scientific evidence that psychologists, psychiatrists, epidemiologists,

41
00:02:45,582 --> 00:02:50,205
and some kinds of sociologists apply to the question of gaming addiction.

42
00:02:51,417 --> 00:02:55,660
Every time I use the word addiction, you're allowed to just put giant quotes around that word.

43
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:59,503
I'm going to talk about the direction, the trajectory that I see things going

44
00:02:59,503 --> 00:03:03,846
if nobody in the industry changes their current behavior sets,

45
00:03:03,846 --> 00:03:05,267
what the end game is going to be.

46
00:03:05,267 --> 00:03:09,590
And I'm going to try, time permitting, to be somewhat optimistic

47
00:03:09,590 --> 00:03:13,853
and offer an alternative vision that doesn't involve plowing into the side of a mountain.

48
00:03:16,595 --> 00:03:20,496
So to start, for some historic perspective,

49
00:03:20,496 --> 00:03:24,997
to kind of zoom out in terms of how we see

50
00:03:24,997 --> 00:03:26,337
our concerns about games.

51
00:03:26,337 --> 00:03:31,499
Concerns about games are very certainly not new.

52
00:03:31,499 --> 00:03:34,720
The first documented case I could find

53
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,560
of a relatively popular game was in the New York Times

54
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,561
in the mid-1970s.

55
00:03:38,561 --> 00:03:41,522
There was a game called Death Race.

56
00:03:41,522 --> 00:03:45,123
It was an arcade game, a coin-operated arcade game,

57
00:03:45,123 --> 00:03:45,823
wherein...

58
00:03:46,565 --> 00:03:48,305
I think it was a two-player game.

59
00:03:48,305 --> 00:03:50,366
You drove around killing these gremlins,

60
00:03:50,366 --> 00:03:51,887
and then every time you killed a gremlin,

61
00:03:51,887 --> 00:03:54,708
there was a little tombstone,

62
00:03:54,708 --> 00:03:56,549
and then you had to avoid all the tombstones

63
00:03:56,549 --> 00:03:57,429
of all the gremlins you killed,

64
00:03:57,429 --> 00:03:59,410
and then keep running down gremlins.

65
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:03,212
Any case, the coverage of this concern,

66
00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,573
of this game, is basically the template

67
00:04:05,573 --> 00:04:07,114
for everything that we've observed

68
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:10,075
in the subsequent 40 years, 40-plus years,

69
00:04:10,075 --> 00:04:12,996
of video game media coverage.

70
00:04:12,996 --> 00:04:15,237
So we have an active ingredient.

71
00:04:15,838 --> 00:04:16,881
for our concern.

72
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:20,532
And this is a pretty common one for different video game concerns.

73
00:04:20,532 --> 00:04:22,859
It's that games are interactive.

74
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:25,252
That's the thing that sets them apart

75
00:04:25,252 --> 00:04:26,573
from a different form of media.

76
00:04:26,573 --> 00:04:30,295
That's the thing that makes them qualitatively different.

77
00:04:30,295 --> 00:04:32,897
In some way, when people play games,

78
00:04:32,897 --> 00:04:36,079
they practice and act in a fantasy environment

79
00:04:36,079 --> 00:04:41,403
that generalizes, either through confusion or desensitization.

80
00:04:41,403 --> 00:04:43,924
Their experience in this virtual environment

81
00:04:43,924 --> 00:04:46,686
kind of gets mixed up with or written

82
00:04:46,686 --> 00:04:50,609
over what they would have otherwise developed as

83
00:04:50,609 --> 00:04:52,550
a person if they had never played Death Race 2000.

84
00:04:54,740 --> 00:04:59,141
And then when we're talking about the effects of games on people,

85
00:04:59,141 --> 00:05:02,822
we typically identify a vulnerable party.

86
00:05:02,822 --> 00:05:06,444
They're typically not a 36-year-old straight white guy.

87
00:05:06,444 --> 00:05:09,205
There's some other group of people.

88
00:05:09,205 --> 00:05:13,226
Depending on the kind of media, it might be children, it might be migrants,

89
00:05:13,226 --> 00:05:15,507
it might be women.

90
00:05:15,507 --> 00:05:18,348
Really depending on the different kind of media that we've had a concern about,

91
00:05:18,348 --> 00:05:20,188
there's always a vulnerable group.

92
00:05:21,477 --> 00:05:25,102
If the effects aren't obvious on an individual level,

93
00:05:25,102 --> 00:05:27,725
an argument gets made that on the societal level,

94
00:05:27,725 --> 00:05:30,429
the effect must be significant.

95
00:05:30,429 --> 00:05:34,994
In this one specifically, the expert that they brought in,

96
00:05:34,994 --> 00:05:37,097
he said that this would lead to a higher level

97
00:05:37,097 --> 00:05:38,559
of pedestrian traffic fatalities.

98
00:05:39,948 --> 00:05:42,429
But with these kinds of concerns,

99
00:05:42,429 --> 00:05:45,309
there's always one of these things that,

100
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:47,390
even if there isn't a clear transitive,

101
00:05:47,390 --> 00:05:49,431
rock A scratches rock B, rock B scratches rock C,

102
00:05:49,431 --> 00:05:53,612
so then A on C, there's some kind of probabilistic notion

103
00:05:53,612 --> 00:05:55,553
that happens across the whole population.

104
00:05:55,553 --> 00:05:58,433
And then I apologize, most of the time

105
00:05:58,433 --> 00:06:01,594
that an expert weighs in, they are a psychologist,

106
00:06:01,594 --> 00:06:04,015
just because we're so fancy.

107
00:06:04,015 --> 00:06:07,436
And they always end in free advertising

108
00:06:07,436 --> 00:06:08,577
for the game developer.

109
00:06:10,053 --> 00:06:11,853
this one closes with

110
00:06:11,853 --> 00:06:16,515
but mister brooks was unfazed every time a story comes out he said we get more

111
00:06:16,515 --> 00:06:17,676
and more orders

112
00:06:17,676 --> 00:06:21,717
so i think these these cabinets sold for about a thousand dollars each

113
00:06:21,717 --> 00:06:25,618
so concerns about violent video games uh... i i i i promise i won't labor this

114
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,499
too much i have a point

115
00:06:26,499 --> 00:06:30,120
uh... depending on how you slice the data you actually could think that

116
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,541
violent video games

117
00:06:31,541 --> 00:06:33,621
were positively associated with youth crime

118
00:06:33,621 --> 00:06:37,022
uh... for some period of time between death race

119
00:06:37,022 --> 00:06:39,223
uh... and and when i got my nintendo

120
00:06:39,955 --> 00:06:42,097
But then other things happened in society.

121
00:06:42,097 --> 00:06:45,399
And so from the mid-90s until the present era,

122
00:06:45,399 --> 00:06:48,181
there's almost a perfect negative correlation

123
00:06:48,181 --> 00:06:50,883
between teen crime and violent video game sales

124
00:06:50,883 --> 00:06:51,683
in the United States.

125
00:06:51,683 --> 00:06:55,045
So there are some classes of evidence

126
00:06:55,045 --> 00:06:57,727
that relate to concerns that in some cases

127
00:06:57,727 --> 00:06:59,448
can ameliorate them, at least for certain parts

128
00:06:59,448 --> 00:07:00,029
of the population.

129
00:07:00,029 --> 00:07:02,911
But addiction's a little bit different.

130
00:07:02,911 --> 00:07:05,673
So when we talk about addiction in technology

131
00:07:05,673 --> 00:07:07,274
or addiction in games, interactivity

132
00:07:07,274 --> 00:07:08,475
is still a feature of it.

133
00:07:09,203 --> 00:07:12,146
But actually, in a weird way, it's

134
00:07:12,146 --> 00:07:15,269
both a younger set of concerns and a more static set

135
00:07:15,269 --> 00:07:16,289
of concerns.

136
00:07:16,289 --> 00:07:19,292
So in the same way that interactivity

137
00:07:19,292 --> 00:07:23,897
is important for both, the mode or the model or the lens

138
00:07:23,897 --> 00:07:27,880
that we see technology addiction or gaming addiction through

139
00:07:27,880 --> 00:07:30,703
is intrinsically different.

140
00:07:30,703 --> 00:07:33,866
Because there is a model that already existed.

141
00:07:35,184 --> 00:07:38,106
for us to think about gaming addiction.

142
00:07:38,106 --> 00:07:41,268
So in the late 1990s, there was a psychiatrist

143
00:07:41,268 --> 00:07:42,269
called Ivan Goldberg.

144
00:07:42,269 --> 00:07:45,130
He was one of New York's leading addiction researchers.

145
00:07:45,130 --> 00:07:48,092
And he was so frustrated with the medical model of addiction

146
00:07:48,092 --> 00:07:52,775
that as an act of satire on a email list, on a list serve,

147
00:07:53,834 --> 00:07:56,636
he actually created gaming he created internet addiction

148
00:07:56,636 --> 00:07:59,738
and he just like i like took the checklist approach

149
00:07:59,738 --> 00:08:02,440
and just like point out how silly psychiatrist had been about

150
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,922
pathologizing all these normal parts of life

151
00:08:04,922 --> 00:08:07,644
uh... in the late nineties apparently internet was still part of life

152
00:08:08,649 --> 00:08:11,170
though maybe it wasn't as fun.

153
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,711
And he was shocked because actually it turned real.

154
00:08:13,711 --> 00:08:17,452
People started coming to him with their imagined or real

155
00:08:17,452 --> 00:08:20,113
problems with technology addiction.

156
00:08:20,113 --> 00:08:22,995
And so really what's going on here, this is kind of one of

157
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,396
many indicators that the challenge that we might face

158
00:08:26,396 --> 00:08:28,757
with dealing with concerns or thinking about concerns about

159
00:08:28,757 --> 00:08:30,938
aggression are very different than what

160
00:08:30,938 --> 00:08:32,038
we see with addiction.

161
00:08:33,260 --> 00:08:35,703
So we can compare these on a direct basis.

162
00:08:35,703 --> 00:08:37,885
So when we talk about violent games,

163
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:40,267
we actually have a pretty poor fitting model

164
00:08:40,267 --> 00:08:42,369
from social science to describe the effects

165
00:08:42,369 --> 00:08:43,631
that we would expect.

166
00:08:43,631 --> 00:08:46,293
But when we talk about addiction to games,

167
00:08:46,293 --> 00:08:49,016
we have a pre-existing model, a mold.

168
00:08:49,016 --> 00:08:51,438
People have been studying addiction for a very long time.

169
00:08:51,438 --> 00:08:53,860
So there's an easy fit, at least in terms

170
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:56,603
of a lot of the language and a lot of the assumptions.

171
00:08:58,421 --> 00:09:03,483
For violent games, there's a lot of similarities to other forms of media that have come before.

172
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:09,707
So we have comic books, we have movies, we have novels that have, you know, like crime

173
00:09:09,707 --> 00:09:10,287
novels.

174
00:09:10,287 --> 00:09:13,689
And a lot of these fears, a lot of these concerns were busted.

175
00:09:13,689 --> 00:09:19,652
So when we think about parallels to our concerns about games and aggression, when we think

176
00:09:19,652 --> 00:09:23,594
about those parallels, it kind of leads us to be like, huh, maybe there's not a there

177
00:09:23,594 --> 00:09:23,834
there.

178
00:09:24,612 --> 00:09:28,034
But when we think about addiction, it's very different with games.

179
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:33,857
With games, there's a lot of novel factors that other comparison media don't have.

180
00:09:33,857 --> 00:09:37,560
Many of the fears are supported, but in a kind of weird way.

181
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:43,863
Like, we have anxiety about things like, I don't know, election interference,

182
00:09:43,863 --> 00:09:48,666
or the attention economy, or the monetization of attention.

183
00:09:50,180 --> 00:09:53,042
and they're not really about games or addiction proper,

184
00:09:53,042 --> 00:09:55,864
but because they happen on the same device,

185
00:09:55,864 --> 00:09:57,626
because these things are kind of intrinsically

186
00:09:57,626 --> 00:10:00,568
cross-platform now, our anxieties don't kind of

187
00:10:00,568 --> 00:10:03,470
stay with a console the way they might have

188
00:10:03,470 --> 00:10:04,351
in the mid-90s.

189
00:10:04,351 --> 00:10:07,834
So, you know, there's definitely a,

190
00:10:07,834 --> 00:10:09,215
there's a real qualitative difference

191
00:10:09,215 --> 00:10:12,377
between how a parent or a policymaker sees

192
00:10:12,377 --> 00:10:15,980
a Doom sold on CD-ROM in a box.

193
00:10:17,427 --> 00:10:21,670
in the early 1990s and how they see Call of Duty 4

194
00:10:21,670 --> 00:10:29,055
with endless DLCs and added features

195
00:10:29,055 --> 00:10:32,798
and dynamic challenge generation.

196
00:10:32,798 --> 00:10:36,921
And so the boundaries of the media are very different

197
00:10:36,921 --> 00:10:39,683
and every time that somebody thinks about the limits

198
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,084
or the lack of boundaries on it,

199
00:10:41,084 --> 00:10:42,685
it kind of leads them to think,

200
00:10:42,685 --> 00:10:44,366
oh my goodness, what else could be happening?

201
00:10:45,107 --> 00:10:50,428
So actually, I say this to draw a contrast between the two concerns.

202
00:10:50,428 --> 00:10:52,669
They both involve many of the same actors,

203
00:10:52,669 --> 00:10:55,230
they involve many of the same kind of stakeholders in society,

204
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:59,411
but they are fundamentally different challenges.

205
00:10:59,411 --> 00:11:04,933
The second thing I want to talk about is kind of the philosophical

206
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,213
or theoretical underpinnings of addiction.

207
00:11:08,498 --> 00:11:11,400
Now I've heard this a few times, Celia is great with this,

208
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,601
a few others are really great with this,

209
00:11:12,601 --> 00:11:14,462
is that we need to be really careful

210
00:11:14,462 --> 00:11:16,304
about how we use the term addiction.

211
00:11:16,304 --> 00:11:18,645
And we have a common use of it,

212
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,908
we kind of, it's kind of the same as saying

213
00:11:21,908 --> 00:11:25,911
something's fun, or it's engaging, or it's immersive.

214
00:11:26,982 --> 00:11:30,267
But how we react to the word addiction

215
00:11:30,267 --> 00:11:33,832
really depends on the thing that we're thinking about,

216
00:11:33,832 --> 00:11:36,516
the substance that we're talking about.

217
00:11:36,516 --> 00:11:40,662
If we say my loved one is addicted to smoking

218
00:11:40,662 --> 00:11:43,646
or to heroin or to gambling.

219
00:11:44,158 --> 00:11:45,899
That's very different than saying,

220
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:49,523
he plays too much golf on Sundays,

221
00:11:49,523 --> 00:11:52,727
my teenagers just can't stop on Instagram,

222
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:56,811
or the battery keeps dying on the phone

223
00:11:56,811 --> 00:11:58,733
because there's so much Fortnite being played.

224
00:11:58,733 --> 00:12:00,995
There's something fundamentally different

225
00:12:00,995 --> 00:12:03,318
about how we use the word addiction for these things,

226
00:12:03,318 --> 00:12:05,260
but in English we don't have a lot of really good ways

227
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,581
of discriminating the two.

228
00:12:07,262 --> 00:12:09,502
One way you could discriminate the two, however,

229
00:12:09,502 --> 00:12:12,263
is with the off-the-shelf model that we inherit

230
00:12:12,263 --> 00:12:14,044
from the medical sciences.

231
00:12:14,044 --> 00:12:16,765
So in this model, there's an active ingredient

232
00:12:16,765 --> 00:12:19,205
behind different forms of addiction.

233
00:12:19,205 --> 00:12:21,406
So for smoking, it's nicotine.

234
00:12:21,406 --> 00:12:24,547
For heroin, it's certain classes of opioids.

235
00:12:24,547 --> 00:12:27,248
For gambling, people think it's dopamine,

236
00:12:27,248 --> 00:12:28,608
but they don't really know.

237
00:12:29,409 --> 00:12:35,154
We can see things like when you give Parkinson's patients L-Dopa and they have more free-floating dopamine in their systems.

238
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:43,360
They might for the first time in their lives become gambling addicts. So there's some treatment effects there, but we're not quite sure.

239
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:49,826
But the mechanisms for certain kinds of behavioral dysregulations, things like gaming, things like shopping,

240
00:12:49,826 --> 00:12:54,950
it's not very clear what the kind of mechanism would be, what the active ingredient might be.

241
00:12:55,550 --> 00:12:59,072
But there is, in the way that we practice science on this topic,

242
00:12:59,072 --> 00:13:02,734
an assumption that there is some shared commonality.

243
00:13:02,734 --> 00:13:07,417
There's some kind of active ingredient that lives inside of all gambling,

244
00:13:07,417 --> 00:13:09,958
or lives inside of all sports addiction.

245
00:13:09,958 --> 00:13:11,699
Does that make sense?

246
00:13:11,699 --> 00:13:13,780
Yeah. Thank you.

247
00:13:13,780 --> 00:13:17,342
So, with that in mind, with the medical model in mind,

248
00:13:17,342 --> 00:13:21,505
all good psychiatrists and epidemiologists begin to build taxonomies.

249
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:26,640
There are basically two you've heard about, I would imagine.

250
00:13:26,640 --> 00:13:29,901
The first is the American model from the American Psychiatric

251
00:13:29,901 --> 00:13:31,201
Association.

252
00:13:31,201 --> 00:13:34,802
And the second is a model from a working group

253
00:13:34,802 --> 00:13:37,543
at the World Health Organization, working with the World Health Organization.

254
00:13:37,543 --> 00:13:44,225
The American model is, there was a proposal

255
00:13:44,225 --> 00:13:46,945
made for research on a topic of something

256
00:13:46,945 --> 00:13:48,806
called internet gaming disorder.

257
00:13:48,806 --> 00:13:51,266
The internet is not defined.

258
00:13:51,922 --> 00:13:58,504
And games are not defined, but there is a taxonomy of potential symptoms that are identified.

259
00:13:58,504 --> 00:14:01,286
And I'll talk about them a little bit more in a little bit.

260
00:14:01,286 --> 00:14:05,367
But it is kind of like a syndrome without any of the core definitions.

261
00:14:05,367 --> 00:14:10,570
I've emailed people asking them very desperately in industry and in academia and psychiatry,

262
00:14:10,570 --> 00:14:12,951
what the hell is an internet game?

263
00:14:12,951 --> 00:14:13,811
And nobody can tell me.

264
00:14:15,007 --> 00:14:18,989
The World Health Organization has a more general concept.

265
00:14:18,989 --> 00:14:20,670
It is called gaming disorder, so it

266
00:14:20,670 --> 00:14:22,410
doesn't have the internet in it for any reason.

267
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,612
And the basic idea here is instead

268
00:14:25,612 --> 00:14:27,973
of having symptoms or some kind of indicators of what

269
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,714
the illness should be, they basically

270
00:14:29,714 --> 00:14:33,836
say that it's when you do gaming for a year.

271
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:38,443
and across that year you suffer significant impairment

272
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,164
to something that's important to you.

273
00:14:40,164 --> 00:14:41,644
So it's a bit of a tautology,

274
00:14:41,644 --> 00:14:44,245
it's a little bit of a snake eating itself.

275
00:14:44,245 --> 00:14:47,045
But there's a little disclaimer that says,

276
00:14:47,045 --> 00:14:49,146
but if it's really bad,

277
00:14:49,146 --> 00:14:51,086
if games are super duper disruptive,

278
00:14:51,086 --> 00:14:53,907
then you don't even need to have this problem for a year.

279
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:56,848
And this is basically where we're at right now.

280
00:14:57,599 --> 00:15:01,401
Because it's a class of argument by analogy,

281
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:04,002
which is to say that we think there might be a problem here.

282
00:15:04,002 --> 00:15:05,823
We think there might be an active ingredient.

283
00:15:05,823 --> 00:15:07,824
We think that people's lives might be impacted.

284
00:15:07,824 --> 00:15:09,385
This might be the cause of a disorder

285
00:15:09,385 --> 00:15:11,506
or the cause of ill health.

286
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:13,307
And this is kind of where we are philosophically.

287
00:15:13,307 --> 00:15:14,988
All right, so in some ways,

288
00:15:14,988 --> 00:15:16,849
gambling disorders are jumping off point.

289
00:15:16,849 --> 00:15:19,610
And in some way, different substance abuse disorders

290
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:21,091
are jumping off point.

291
00:15:21,091 --> 00:15:22,752
But here's really where we're landing.

292
00:15:23,809 --> 00:15:26,170
So according to the American Psychiatric Association,

293
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:29,590
essentially, they took the checklist of indicators

294
00:15:29,590 --> 00:15:33,311
for gambling disorder, and they took out the word gambling,

295
00:15:33,311 --> 00:15:35,432
and they put in the word internet gaming.

296
00:15:35,432 --> 00:15:38,592
So there are nine possible indicators.

297
00:15:38,592 --> 00:15:41,193
I just counted, actually, I only put eight on this slide.

298
00:15:41,193 --> 00:15:46,494
And the idea is that if you could say yes to five

299
00:15:46,494 --> 00:15:48,674
or more of these, then you might be classified

300
00:15:48,674 --> 00:15:50,015
as having a problem with gaming.

301
00:15:50,708 --> 00:15:55,009
And again, the idea here is that each one of these possible symptoms is,

302
00:15:55,009 --> 00:15:58,410
it's like equally indicative of you having a problem.

303
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:02,610
And that assumption is kind of supported by the fact, or rather,

304
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:10,872
that assumption is supported by the idea that there is something in all games,

305
00:16:10,872 --> 00:16:14,673
no matter what type they are, that's analogous to the thing that's inside

306
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:18,634
all cigarettes, no matter who manufactures them, that is kind of.

307
00:16:19,395 --> 00:16:26,477
generally addictive for those who might be vulnerable.

308
00:16:26,477 --> 00:16:27,098
Does that make sense?

309
00:16:27,098 --> 00:16:28,118
All right.

310
00:16:28,118 --> 00:16:28,978
So in the third bit,

311
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:32,439
I'm gonna talk a little bit about evidence.

312
00:16:32,439 --> 00:16:34,040
So as a scientist, I love evidence.

313
00:16:34,040 --> 00:16:35,400
As someone who lives in England,

314
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:38,101
I love that my airplane works and gets me here.

315
00:16:38,101 --> 00:16:41,522
And also, I'm really interested to know

316
00:16:41,522 --> 00:16:43,703
what scientists have been up to for the last 20 years.

317
00:16:43,703 --> 00:16:46,924
So depending on what words you use

318
00:16:46,924 --> 00:16:48,024
when you look up a literature,

319
00:16:48,923 --> 00:16:50,904
on video gaming addiction.

320
00:16:50,904 --> 00:16:53,825
You can call it disordered gaming, problem gaming,

321
00:16:53,825 --> 00:16:56,566
gaming addiction, internet gaming disorder,

322
00:16:56,566 --> 00:16:57,707
gaming disorder.

323
00:16:57,707 --> 00:17:00,008
You kind of have to write a pretty long search string.

324
00:17:00,008 --> 00:17:03,669
There's between 50 and maybe 300 studies

325
00:17:03,669 --> 00:17:06,050
on gaming addiction in the last few decades.

326
00:17:06,050 --> 00:17:10,592
And they fall into one of basically four tranches.

327
00:17:10,592 --> 00:17:12,853
The first is kind of measurement.

328
00:17:12,853 --> 00:17:15,894
So if there's a there there, how do we measure it?

329
00:17:17,011 --> 00:17:20,632
The second is neuroimaging studies.

330
00:17:20,632 --> 00:17:22,932
So in some way, can we learn something

331
00:17:22,932 --> 00:17:27,473
about how typical versus non-typical gamers approach

332
00:17:27,473 --> 00:17:31,274
games based on something that is a signal that we

333
00:17:31,274 --> 00:17:33,554
can detect in an fMRI scanner?

334
00:17:33,554 --> 00:17:37,515
Symptomatology, these are studies

335
00:17:37,515 --> 00:17:41,456
about kind of what would gaming disorder

336
00:17:41,456 --> 00:17:43,776
be correlated with in the world of psychopathology?

337
00:17:43,776 --> 00:17:45,936
How does it kind of fit in the larger, excuse me?

338
00:17:46,441 --> 00:17:49,283
in the larger puzzle of mental illness.

339
00:17:49,283 --> 00:17:50,504
And then treatment.

340
00:17:50,504 --> 00:17:53,346
So this is if somebody has a problem,

341
00:17:53,346 --> 00:17:55,708
how might we help them?

342
00:17:55,708 --> 00:17:58,330
All right?

343
00:17:58,330 --> 00:17:59,110
So,

344
00:17:59,110 --> 00:18:01,652
overwhelmingly,

345
00:18:01,652 --> 00:18:05,235
the great majority of those 250 studies

346
00:18:05,235 --> 00:18:07,136
are measurement studies.

347
00:18:07,889 --> 00:18:08,710
All right.

348
00:18:08,710 --> 00:18:11,852
So these are large, typically large scale,

349
00:18:11,852 --> 00:18:14,713
so maybe between 150 and our work

350
00:18:14,713 --> 00:18:16,094
has upwards of 20,000 participants.

351
00:18:16,094 --> 00:18:23,499
And the idea is that using some form of survey research,

352
00:18:23,499 --> 00:18:25,661
you cast as wide a net as possible

353
00:18:25,661 --> 00:18:27,522
within this medical framework.

354
00:18:27,522 --> 00:18:32,085
And you try to test if those symptoms or those indicators,

355
00:18:32,085 --> 00:18:33,686
if the sniffles and coughs that you

356
00:18:33,686 --> 00:18:35,967
think are related to the underlying problem of gaming

357
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:36,447
addiction.

358
00:18:37,201 --> 00:18:40,503
if those are actually present in the population?

359
00:18:40,503 --> 00:18:43,245
And how good are those questions at discriminating

360
00:18:43,245 --> 00:18:47,107
a player who's playing out of a sense of choice and volition

361
00:18:47,107 --> 00:18:50,549
from a player who's playing out of a sense of, say, compulsion,

362
00:18:50,549 --> 00:18:52,771
feeling like they have to play instead of feeling

363
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:53,591
like they want to play?

364
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:57,353
Unfortunately, the great majority of this research

365
00:18:57,353 --> 00:18:59,154
uses what's called convenience sampling.

366
00:18:59,154 --> 00:19:02,477
So in the rare cases where you actually

367
00:19:02,477 --> 00:19:04,998
get gamers who have problems with play,

368
00:19:05,895 --> 00:19:10,919
it's because the researcher has gone to a gaming addiction subreddit,

369
00:19:10,919 --> 00:19:19,025
or they've gone to a part of the internet where gamers who have problems regulating their play kind of congregate,

370
00:19:19,025 --> 00:19:20,086
and then they conduct this research.

371
00:19:20,086 --> 00:19:26,270
And in some ways this is a bit like researching drug use only outside of a needle exchange.

372
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:29,940
you don't get a very clear sense of how many people in the population have a

373
00:19:29,940 --> 00:19:30,841
problem

374
00:19:30,841 --> 00:19:33,967
if you're sampling only within certain kind of tranches

375
00:19:33,967 --> 00:19:35,971
in certain parts of certain communities.

376
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:40,371
But it is the case that of these 250 studies,

377
00:19:40,371 --> 00:19:44,533
not 250, but of about 200 of these studies,

378
00:19:44,533 --> 00:19:47,134
really what's going on are these convenience samples.

379
00:19:47,134 --> 00:19:48,875
So people are running a thesis,

380
00:19:48,875 --> 00:19:51,476
they're doing a project in a high school,

381
00:19:51,476 --> 00:19:53,237
or a school system,

382
00:19:53,237 --> 00:19:57,999
or they're having friends of friends of friends of friends of friends take surveys.

383
00:19:57,999 --> 00:20:03,322
The second class of study are different types of neuroscience studies.

384
00:20:06,301 --> 00:20:08,242
These are much, much smaller studies.

385
00:20:08,242 --> 00:20:12,283
They have small samples because the amount of money

386
00:20:12,283 --> 00:20:14,964
it takes to, it costs at least $1,700 an hour

387
00:20:14,964 --> 00:20:17,824
to give somebody, to prepare someone

388
00:20:17,824 --> 00:20:19,265
and then do an fMRI scan.

389
00:20:19,265 --> 00:20:22,106
So these studies typically have very small samples,

390
00:20:22,106 --> 00:20:24,526
between 10 and 20 people in them.

391
00:20:24,526 --> 00:20:28,268
And the basic idea behind all of these studies

392
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:30,928
is they give a large number of gamers

393
00:20:30,928 --> 00:20:32,829
in a community a survey.

394
00:20:34,043 --> 00:20:37,026
They try to flag the ones that are like low players

395
00:20:37,026 --> 00:20:39,468
and high players or the ones they think

396
00:20:39,468 --> 00:20:40,589
might have a problem with gaming

397
00:20:40,589 --> 00:20:42,931
and the ones that they think are quote unquote normal.

398
00:20:42,931 --> 00:20:44,232
All right.

399
00:20:44,232 --> 00:20:47,975
And then they have them do tasks in an fMRI

400
00:20:47,975 --> 00:20:51,858
where they show them in many cases,

401
00:20:51,858 --> 00:20:54,240
reminders of their favorite game.

402
00:20:54,240 --> 00:20:58,264
And then they try to see how much activation there is,

403
00:20:58,264 --> 00:21:00,606
relative activation there is between the two groups.

404
00:21:01,897 --> 00:21:05,659
And while this doesn't actually tell you anything about addiction,

405
00:21:05,659 --> 00:21:07,661
you do observe some differences.

406
00:21:07,661 --> 00:21:11,883
And you don't know if that's just because they like the games a whole lot.

407
00:21:11,883 --> 00:21:14,745
But there have been many, many studies like this.

408
00:21:14,745 --> 00:21:18,308
And one of these will come out at least once a month,

409
00:21:18,308 --> 00:21:20,950
every month, for the rest of our lives.

410
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:27,317
The symptomatology studies, sorry, I'm getting a bit grim.

411
00:21:27,317 --> 00:21:30,039
I should not get grim for another 15 minutes.

412
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:34,962
All right, the third set is much less common

413
00:21:34,962 --> 00:21:36,923
than it should be, and I consider it

414
00:21:36,923 --> 00:21:39,805
a very interesting set of study, class of studies,

415
00:21:39,805 --> 00:21:45,488
where basically people try to figure out

416
00:21:45,488 --> 00:21:50,191
if you score high on these questionnaires

417
00:21:50,191 --> 00:21:53,653
of gaming disorder, what else do you score high on?

418
00:21:54,043 --> 00:22:00,105
Not thinking necessarily that gaming disorder causes these other problems, but how do different

419
00:22:00,105 --> 00:22:04,706
kind of constellations or how do different kind of clusters of these disorders kind of

420
00:22:04,706 --> 00:22:06,726
relate to each other or interrelate?

421
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,547
Is gaming in some way a coping mechanism?

422
00:22:09,547 --> 00:22:13,447
Is problem gaming in some way a coping mechanism for something that's either organic, going

423
00:22:13,447 --> 00:22:19,569
on in someone's brain, or linked to a social environment or some kind of stressor like

424
00:22:19,569 --> 00:22:20,849
school?

425
00:22:20,849 --> 00:22:22,009
And unfortunately...

426
00:22:22,533 --> 00:22:26,817
This kind of research is really hampered by the medical model.

427
00:22:26,817 --> 00:22:31,721
So there are some gatekeepers in academia who have some very clear ideas about what

428
00:22:31,721 --> 00:22:33,022
gaming addiction is and isn't.

429
00:22:33,022 --> 00:22:38,647
And so if you kind of come with this kind of open-minded exploratory perspective, it's

430
00:22:38,647 --> 00:22:41,610
much harder to publish the papers.

431
00:22:41,610 --> 00:22:45,473
And I don't know how much you know about academic publishing, but it's quite important.

432
00:22:45,473 --> 00:22:48,175
Not as important as getting grants, but it's up there.

433
00:22:48,175 --> 00:22:50,097
Does that make sense?

434
00:22:51,837 --> 00:22:52,799
I thought I saw a hand.

435
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:54,061
I got really worried for a second there.

436
00:22:54,061 --> 00:22:54,802
All right.

437
00:22:54,802 --> 00:23:01,252
And then by far, thankfully, the rarest class of study

438
00:23:01,252 --> 00:23:03,095
are the treatment studies.

439
00:23:04,513 --> 00:23:05,694
So these are exceedingly rare.

440
00:23:05,694 --> 00:23:07,635
I found three of these.

441
00:23:07,635 --> 00:23:09,536
And I look every few weeks.

442
00:23:09,536 --> 00:23:11,457
I have a search that runs.

443
00:23:11,457 --> 00:23:17,600
And in these studies, basically what happens is either

444
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,822
there is a behavioral or a pharmaceutical intervention

445
00:23:21,822 --> 00:23:27,926
with a population of players who are either self-identified

446
00:23:27,926 --> 00:23:30,867
or a therapist has decided they have a problem with games.

447
00:23:32,277 --> 00:23:35,060
The typical treatment is cognitive behavioral therapy,

448
00:23:35,060 --> 00:23:40,464
which one might think works with a lot of different problems.

449
00:23:40,464 --> 00:23:44,908
But I am quite worried from an ethics perspective

450
00:23:44,908 --> 00:23:48,852
about before we have disorders, a disorder that

451
00:23:48,852 --> 00:23:52,315
has real symptoms and a real course of treatment,

452
00:23:52,315 --> 00:23:54,457
potential course of treatment, that we're giving people

453
00:23:54,457 --> 00:23:56,339
medication for gaming.

454
00:23:56,339 --> 00:23:58,000
Does that make sense?

455
00:23:58,794 --> 00:24:00,095
So those are the four classes.

456
00:24:00,095 --> 00:24:01,757
The great majority of the studies

457
00:24:01,757 --> 00:24:05,841
are these cheap and easy studies where you collect

458
00:24:05,841 --> 00:24:07,582
a load of participants.

459
00:24:07,582 --> 00:24:09,724
You ask them about their favorite hobby.

460
00:24:09,724 --> 00:24:11,706
Some of them say they have a problem.

461
00:24:11,706 --> 00:24:13,207
You do a bunch of statistics.

462
00:24:13,207 --> 00:24:16,750
Second is you con a research agency

463
00:24:16,750 --> 00:24:20,534
into giving you $250,000, and you scan 30 people's brains

464
00:24:20,534 --> 00:24:23,637
and show them pictures of World of Warcraft and Fortnite

465
00:24:23,637 --> 00:24:24,057
dances.

466
00:24:24,944 --> 00:24:29,128
The third is you kind of do some really cool network science,

467
00:24:29,128 --> 00:24:31,530
which I'm sure some people in the room know how to do.

468
00:24:31,530 --> 00:24:35,273
And you try to see how these things constellate over time.

469
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:39,076
And then you have the island of Dr. Moreau.

470
00:24:39,076 --> 00:24:45,522
So when you look at this literature, kind of by and large,

471
00:24:45,522 --> 00:24:48,324
the data is actually fairly low quality.

472
00:24:52,028 --> 00:24:53,689
the studies aren't done very well,

473
00:24:53,689 --> 00:24:56,110
there isn't a lot of transparency,

474
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,531
nobody has their hypotheses before they collect their data,

475
00:24:59,531 --> 00:25:01,532
you can't see anyone's statistical models

476
00:25:01,532 --> 00:25:03,493
because they don't share their code.

477
00:25:03,493 --> 00:25:07,174
So there have been a few consortiums of researchers,

478
00:25:07,174 --> 00:25:07,854
of which I count myself,

479
00:25:07,854 --> 00:25:11,516
where we kind of try to point these things out.

480
00:25:11,516 --> 00:25:14,157
We try to say, hey, hold on a second,

481
00:25:14,157 --> 00:25:18,398
there are two billion video game players in the world,

482
00:25:18,398 --> 00:25:20,579
these 250 studies are kind of garbage.

483
00:25:21,543 --> 00:25:24,664
We're really going out on a limb here.

484
00:25:24,664 --> 00:25:26,105
If you're running a health system,

485
00:25:26,105 --> 00:25:29,006
this isn't, you know, you wouldn't identify

486
00:25:29,006 --> 00:25:32,308
a new parasite this way.

487
00:25:32,308 --> 00:25:35,909
Why are you talking about a new behavioral disorder?

488
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:42,672
Well, unfortunately, games are very, very popular.

489
00:25:42,672 --> 00:25:45,734
So does anyone know what the base rate fallacy is?

490
00:25:45,734 --> 00:25:46,814
All right.

491
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:49,075
What if I told you

492
00:25:50,163 --> 00:25:54,205
that almost all serial killers wear socks.

493
00:25:54,205 --> 00:25:54,766
All right?

494
00:25:54,766 --> 00:26:04,192
If you didn't know how many people in the general population wore socks,

495
00:26:04,192 --> 00:26:07,654
you could interpret this as a pretty good signal

496
00:26:07,654 --> 00:26:11,017
that the person, any given person with socks,

497
00:26:11,017 --> 00:26:14,539
you don't actually have socks,

498
00:26:14,539 --> 00:26:15,520
is a serial killer.

499
00:26:16,919 --> 00:26:18,580
Games are super popular.

500
00:26:18,580 --> 00:26:22,803
This means that a giant slice of young people, upwards of 95%,

501
00:26:22,803 --> 00:26:26,206
depending on how you count, are pretty engaged

502
00:26:26,206 --> 00:26:29,348
with some form of game that kind of hits them at the right.

503
00:26:29,348 --> 00:26:30,789
They bounce off a bunch of stuff,

504
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,731
but it hits them at the right angle.

505
00:26:32,731 --> 00:26:35,853
And they find their game for a few months or a few years.

506
00:26:35,853 --> 00:26:40,957
So when something bad happens in a young person's life, which

507
00:26:40,957 --> 00:26:44,900
is inevitable, there is an unending stream

508
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:46,381
of anecdotal evidence.

509
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:50,777
And this anecdotal evidence, I have to tell you,

510
00:26:50,777 --> 00:26:55,300
oh, things are getting grim, is more than enough

511
00:26:55,300 --> 00:26:57,302
for this party to stop.

512
00:26:57,302 --> 00:27:06,609
It is true that there is actually

513
00:27:06,609 --> 00:27:07,770
some evidence of absence.

514
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:11,673
But because the evidence base is so crap,

515
00:27:11,673 --> 00:27:13,234
we have to fall back on.

516
00:27:14,693 --> 00:27:17,354
the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

517
00:27:17,354 --> 00:27:20,375
So we don't know what we don't know

518
00:27:20,375 --> 00:27:24,776
because research isn't being done properly.

519
00:27:24,776 --> 00:27:27,937
And in the meantime, we're going to have monster

520
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:29,838
of the week, scary story.

521
00:27:29,838 --> 00:27:34,760
And that's more than enough to motivate regulators.

522
00:27:34,760 --> 00:27:36,760
And that's more than enough to motivate people

523
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:40,882
who run health systems in a way that we would have never seen

524
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,102
with violence and aggression.

525
00:27:46,475 --> 00:27:50,137
So we'll talk a little bit about endgame.

526
00:27:50,137 --> 00:27:50,938
All right.

527
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:53,740
This is my most optimistic slide.

528
00:27:53,740 --> 00:27:58,423
All right.

529
00:27:58,423 --> 00:28:02,465
So, I think best case scenario,

530
00:28:02,465 --> 00:28:08,510
this party's gonna go on for about five more years.

531
00:28:08,510 --> 00:28:10,951
All right?

532
00:28:10,951 --> 00:28:15,134
So, the public, the people who control taxation,

533
00:28:15,898 --> 00:28:17,580
and commerce.

534
00:28:17,580 --> 00:28:18,741
They're that tiny little boat.

535
00:28:18,741 --> 00:28:20,603
Actually, this metaphor breaks down

536
00:28:20,603 --> 00:28:21,424
the more I think about it.

537
00:28:21,424 --> 00:28:25,688
I thought I was very clever when I drew this picture, okay?

538
00:28:26,302 --> 00:28:27,403
I'm just going to go with it.

539
00:28:27,403 --> 00:28:29,044
It's an indestructible boat.

540
00:28:29,044 --> 00:28:29,945
It's in God mode.

541
00:28:29,945 --> 00:28:30,165
OK.

542
00:28:30,165 --> 00:28:34,609
So there is a level of understanding

543
00:28:34,609 --> 00:28:36,671
that the public and policymakers have.

544
00:28:36,671 --> 00:28:42,096
They can intuit a whole bunch of stuff about gaming addiction

545
00:28:42,096 --> 00:28:45,480
or about the larger halo around games

546
00:28:45,480 --> 00:28:47,802
and behavioral dysregulation that

547
00:28:47,802 --> 00:28:50,885
are the obvious salient features.

548
00:28:52,630 --> 00:28:55,174
Very few people like real money transactions.

549
00:28:55,174 --> 00:28:56,636
No one likes pay to win, right?

550
00:28:56,636 --> 00:29:01,823
Loot boxes are like, if I ever hear that word again.

551
00:29:02,446 --> 00:29:11,571
And anti-social behavior on platforms where people don't take, where developers don't take these things seriously and kids come right, rightly

552
00:29:11,571 --> 00:29:17,253
to their parents terrified or or minorly traumatized by a

553
00:29:17,253 --> 00:29:19,715
irresponsible design decision.

554
00:29:19,715 --> 00:29:22,776
There are some things over the surface

555
00:29:22,776 --> 00:29:29,920
that that quote-unquote normal people can see there that are kind of illnesses in the industry. All right, but

556
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:35,757
as the little boat that's indestructible gets closer to the iceberg,

557
00:29:35,757 --> 00:29:39,639
they're going to be able to see all the other stuff.

558
00:29:39,639 --> 00:29:45,022
And once they start poking around with regulations,

559
00:29:45,022 --> 00:29:51,425
their hands are just going to go into all of these different pies.

560
00:29:51,425 --> 00:29:53,226
There's a lot of booths around this kind of stuff.

561
00:29:53,226 --> 00:29:54,647
I don't know. You should walk around the expo center.

562
00:29:54,647 --> 00:29:55,367
It's kind of cool stuff.

563
00:29:57,782 --> 00:30:00,063
So why is this happening?

564
00:30:00,063 --> 00:30:02,685
Why is this collision inevitable?

565
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:06,366
Well, there are some things that the people in this room

566
00:30:06,366 --> 00:30:07,927
don't have a lot of control over.

567
00:30:07,927 --> 00:30:08,848
All right?

568
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:12,950
First, generally, there's been a deterioration

569
00:30:12,950 --> 00:30:15,331
in the quality of science journalism.

570
00:30:15,331 --> 00:30:19,153
So a lot of newsrooms don't have scientists covering science

571
00:30:19,153 --> 00:30:21,314
beats anymore because of just things that are

572
00:30:21,314 --> 00:30:23,395
happening in that profession.

573
00:30:24,765 --> 00:30:26,427
Second, there's been, since the year 2000,

574
00:30:26,427 --> 00:30:28,470
there's been a rise in what could be called

575
00:30:28,470 --> 00:30:29,671
moral entrepreneurs.

576
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:32,695
So these, it's not necessarily morals

577
00:30:32,695 --> 00:30:34,416
in terms of right or wrong,

578
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,898
but it's morals in terms of norms.

579
00:30:35,898 --> 00:30:37,220
This is an idea from sociology.

580
00:30:37,220 --> 00:30:40,063
So the idea is that there are people who kind of,

581
00:30:41,304 --> 00:30:44,986
listen to, feel the way the wind is blowing,

582
00:30:44,986 --> 00:30:48,007
interpret what the norm is around a technology,

583
00:30:48,007 --> 00:30:50,729
and then what they do is they sell that back to us

584
00:30:50,729 --> 00:30:52,649
in the form of parenting advice

585
00:30:52,649 --> 00:30:54,370
in a kind of a high profile book.

586
00:30:54,370 --> 00:30:57,031
And in the last two decades,

587
00:30:57,031 --> 00:31:00,253
we've gotten this increasingly with social media,

588
00:31:00,253 --> 00:31:02,194
with games.

589
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:06,236
Does anyone in the audience,

590
00:31:06,236 --> 00:31:08,157
raise your hand if you know who Phil Zimbardo is.

591
00:31:09,947 --> 00:31:11,789
This is good.

592
00:31:11,789 --> 00:31:14,330
Uh-oh, I heard a ringing noise.

593
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:18,333
Somebody didn't listen to my rule about ringing.

594
00:31:18,333 --> 00:31:19,614
OK, it's not my rule.

595
00:31:19,614 --> 00:31:21,556
Just give me perfect scores, please.

596
00:31:21,556 --> 00:31:23,437
All right.

597
00:31:23,437 --> 00:31:23,897
I don't care.

598
00:31:23,897 --> 00:31:24,538
You can all make noise.

599
00:31:24,538 --> 00:31:26,059
I just need the perfect scores.

600
00:31:26,059 --> 00:31:29,241
So anyway, some of you had your hands up.

601
00:31:29,241 --> 00:31:30,202
Let's assume 11%.

602
00:31:30,202 --> 00:31:34,805
Who knows that Phil Zimbardo wrote a book about video games?

603
00:31:36,059 --> 00:31:37,841
One, two, okay, I might have, yeah,

604
00:31:37,841 --> 00:31:39,763
we've probably talked, you've talked about it.

605
00:31:39,763 --> 00:31:43,007
All right, he did.

606
00:31:43,007 --> 00:31:45,110
He wrote an entire, Phil Zimbardo,

607
00:31:45,110 --> 00:31:48,814
the guy who did the Stanford Prison Experiment,

608
00:31:48,814 --> 00:31:51,037
he wrote a whole book about how

609
00:31:51,037 --> 00:31:53,460
video games are feminizing boys.

610
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:56,382
This was completely new to me.

611
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:59,485
I read the book, it was thankfully, it was quite short.

612
00:31:59,485 --> 00:32:02,727
Just type Zimbardo-Shabilsky debate

613
00:32:02,727 --> 00:32:04,208
when you have some free time

614
00:32:04,208 --> 00:32:07,111
and you can watch what happens.

615
00:32:07,111 --> 00:32:10,053
But there is now, there's kind of an economic

616
00:32:10,053 --> 00:32:13,376
thought leader niche around technology.

617
00:32:13,376 --> 00:32:16,779
And so every six or 10 months,

618
00:32:16,779 --> 00:32:19,021
it's kind of like pulling a lever or a loot box,

619
00:32:19,021 --> 00:32:22,804
we get a different new technological demon.

620
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:28,215
And a lot of them land on games. You don't have a lot of control over that. I do my best as a scientist.

621
00:32:28,215 --> 00:32:31,015
Um, there's a lot of technological anxieties in the air.

622
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:38,077
So in the same way that we might be very proud about games being able to play on all of these different platforms,

623
00:32:38,077 --> 00:32:38,997
not mentioning any giant company,

624
00:32:38,997 --> 00:32:45,998
it's the case that we also do other things on those devices.

625
00:32:45,998 --> 00:32:49,939
Like our email or our grinder or wait, no, I didn't say that.

626
00:32:50,433 --> 00:32:55,437
But we, and so in our minds when we use this device,

627
00:32:55,437 --> 00:32:57,558
we have a pretty undifferentiated sense

628
00:32:57,558 --> 00:33:01,360
of what it might do for us or to us.

629
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:03,682
And if games are part of that ecology,

630
00:33:03,682 --> 00:33:06,163
that part of that, kind of that blurring

631
00:33:06,163 --> 00:33:08,624
of our hopes and our anxieties,

632
00:33:08,624 --> 00:33:10,786
then what we might think of as an affordance,

633
00:33:10,786 --> 00:33:12,727
helping somebody play a game on a platform,

634
00:33:12,727 --> 00:33:16,329
it might actually associate our other feelings

635
00:33:16,329 --> 00:33:17,930
about arguing on Twitter

636
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,251
with our lovely games of Fortnite.

637
00:33:20,937 --> 00:33:23,920
And then the final thing is that, and this is absolutely true and I'll speak

638
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:27,663
autobiographically, there are a lot of really bad psychologists out there, there's a lot of bad

639
00:33:27,663 --> 00:33:31,646
academics and professors out there and I can't control their behavior

640
00:33:31,646 --> 00:33:33,347
and I try to call it out when I can

641
00:33:33,347 --> 00:33:36,349
when I have knowledge of it, but

642
00:33:36,349 --> 00:33:38,551
your industry has some pretty bad actors in it

643
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:42,414
and they might ruin the party for you

644
00:33:42,414 --> 00:33:44,756
and you don't necessarily have control over that.

645
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:49,980
Things you do have control over.

646
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:57,054
All right, I've heard the answer to bad speech

647
00:33:57,054 --> 00:33:58,615
is good speech, more speech,

648
00:33:58,615 --> 00:34:00,236
you just keep pulling that again,

649
00:34:00,236 --> 00:34:01,958
you just keep finding analogies.

650
00:34:01,958 --> 00:34:05,281
One way you can say is the answer to bad science

651
00:34:05,281 --> 00:34:06,162
is good science.

652
00:34:06,162 --> 00:34:08,504
The problem is, is there's no good science.

653
00:34:09,807 --> 00:34:12,669
And that's partly because it's actually very hard

654
00:34:12,669 --> 00:34:16,410
to do good science on gaming addiction

655
00:34:16,410 --> 00:34:18,872
because unlike other things,

656
00:34:18,872 --> 00:34:21,413
if you're a researcher and you want to know

657
00:34:21,413 --> 00:34:28,596
the effects of nicotine on smokers or on mammals,

658
00:34:28,596 --> 00:34:32,258
you can go out to the store and you can buy cigarettes

659
00:34:32,258 --> 00:34:35,139
and you can analyze everything that's in them

660
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:35,940
as a biochemist.

661
00:34:37,195 --> 00:34:41,197
All right, and then you can synthesize your own thing and you can run your own study.

662
00:34:41,197 --> 00:34:45,338
You actually can't do that with a lot of games because of how they're designed, how they're

663
00:34:45,338 --> 00:34:48,660
updated, how the IP is traced and taken care of.

664
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:56,963
And so actually, scientists have a much poorer idea, a much less enriched idea of what actually

665
00:34:56,963 --> 00:35:03,365
happens inside of games because so much of it is considered IP, so much of it is considered

666
00:35:03,365 --> 00:35:06,066
So much of it is outside the scope of...

667
00:35:07,267 --> 00:35:09,088
of scientific inquiry.

668
00:35:09,088 --> 00:35:14,012
It's a bit like, imagine that you're coming across,

669
00:35:14,012 --> 00:35:17,075
it's late at night and you come across a drunk

670
00:35:17,075 --> 00:35:19,477
and he's looking furtively around at the ground

671
00:35:19,477 --> 00:35:20,838
underneath the street lamp.

672
00:35:20,838 --> 00:35:22,780
And you say to him, sir, what are you doing?

673
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:26,123
And he says, I'm looking for the keys to my house.

674
00:35:26,123 --> 00:35:28,425
And you say, why, did you drop them here?

675
00:35:28,425 --> 00:35:32,008
And he says, no, but this is the only place that I can see.

676
00:35:33,254 --> 00:35:37,657
What's happening, part of the reason why the literature

677
00:35:37,657 --> 00:35:42,761
on gaming addiction or on aggression is so irredeemable

678
00:35:42,761 --> 00:35:45,062
is because you all have the data that's required

679
00:35:45,062 --> 00:35:45,903
to actually study it.

680
00:35:45,903 --> 00:35:49,265
And what many academic scientists are left with

681
00:35:49,265 --> 00:35:50,426
are the scraps.

682
00:35:50,426 --> 00:35:55,370
And this is part, I think in some way, of two things.

683
00:35:55,370 --> 00:35:58,792
The first thing is, I know people in the industry

684
00:35:58,792 --> 00:36:00,933
were really burned by the aggression debate.

685
00:36:01,958 --> 00:36:06,842
And the First Amendment's basically the reason why we're not having a very different set

686
00:36:06,842 --> 00:36:08,543
of conversations right now.

687
00:36:08,543 --> 00:36:14,727
And the second is an on-by-default defensive posture, a reactive posture.

688
00:36:14,727 --> 00:36:22,252
And it's true that things are only steadily, slightly getting worse every six months.

689
00:36:22,252 --> 00:36:26,855
And so area under the curve profit, things are fine.

690
00:36:26,855 --> 00:36:29,197
But they are getting irredeemably worse.

691
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:34,665
There are certain authorities that are looking very closely

692
00:36:34,665 --> 00:36:35,966
at regulating.

693
00:36:35,966 --> 00:36:38,187
I'm on two in the United Kingdom.

694
00:36:38,187 --> 00:36:40,428
And there is blowback.

695
00:36:40,428 --> 00:36:43,889
So a few months ago, so it's very easy

696
00:36:43,889 --> 00:36:46,570
to think of something like the World Health Organization

697
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,292
as an organized body that really has its ducks in a row.

698
00:36:49,292 --> 00:36:52,393
See, I'm in America, so I can use duck idioms.

699
00:36:52,393 --> 00:36:56,075
And they really weren't.

700
00:36:56,354 --> 00:36:58,616
they were really internally quite,

701
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,957
the World Health Organization,

702
00:36:59,957 --> 00:37:01,198
they were really quite fraught

703
00:37:01,198 --> 00:37:03,720
about this gaming disorder thing.

704
00:37:03,720 --> 00:37:05,902
The people who were working in the ICD-11,

705
00:37:05,902 --> 00:37:08,204
they'd really gone out on a limb, all right?

706
00:37:08,204 --> 00:37:12,688
And there was a lot of debate internally in the UN.

707
00:37:12,688 --> 00:37:17,592
And then the ESA decided to publish

708
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:19,514
a rebuttal to the evidence.

709
00:37:20,545 --> 00:37:24,126
and it cherry-picked some of my research,

710
00:37:24,126 --> 00:37:26,607
just the parts that show games aren't so bad,

711
00:37:26,607 --> 00:37:28,768
not the parts that say that people's thoughts

712
00:37:28,768 --> 00:37:31,689
about them being good are also overblown.

713
00:37:31,689 --> 00:37:33,930
Cherry-picked some stuff about games being great

714
00:37:33,930 --> 00:37:36,410
for cognitive development, yada, yada, yada,

715
00:37:36,410 --> 00:37:36,850
that's bullshit.

716
00:37:36,850 --> 00:37:42,552
And then went to town with a press release.

717
00:37:42,552 --> 00:37:45,213
And you know what everyone woke up to

718
00:37:45,213 --> 00:37:48,174
the next morning in the UN?

719
00:37:48,174 --> 00:37:49,995
A circle the wagons moment.

720
00:37:50,890 --> 00:37:55,196
So now they're much more convinced that they were right the whole time and you're all evil.

721
00:37:55,196 --> 00:37:59,402
I would have warned you not to do that.

722
00:37:59,402 --> 00:38:05,710
So my piece of advice here is I think you probably all should consider bracing for impact.

723
00:38:10,850 --> 00:38:15,393
There are a lot of bad things that can come from this reactive stance, from there not

724
00:38:15,393 --> 00:38:21,877
being good science, from there being monster of the week anecdotal, anecdata, from rightfully

725
00:38:21,877 --> 00:38:22,937
scared parents.

726
00:38:22,937 --> 00:38:28,361
The first is, there's going to be stigmatization, we're going to stigmatize a hobby of more

727
00:38:28,361 --> 00:38:29,782
than a billion people on this planet.

728
00:38:31,262 --> 00:38:34,585
The second is that there's going to be a lot of really dumb regulation coming down the

729
00:38:34,585 --> 00:38:34,805
pipe.

730
00:38:34,805 --> 00:38:39,449
It's going to be inspired, just like the medical metaphor, the medical model metaphor, it's

731
00:38:39,449 --> 00:38:41,531
going to be inspired by that.

732
00:38:41,531 --> 00:38:46,876
So in the EU we have these, I don't know if they're in America yet, like these giant packet

733
00:38:46,876 --> 00:38:51,259
warnings on cigarettes that show you like a lung that got coughed out of a dilophosaurus

734
00:38:51,259 --> 00:38:52,340
or something.

735
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:54,402
You're going to get that.

736
00:38:55,254 --> 00:38:59,897
There's going to be, depending on the patchwork of markets and regulations, in some places

737
00:38:59,897 --> 00:39:05,259
more aggressive regulators are going to fragment the market, the marketplace, and you're going

738
00:39:05,259 --> 00:39:07,201
to have certain kinds of labeling rules.

739
00:39:07,201 --> 00:39:10,542
There are going to be sin taxes, cost of doing business.

740
00:39:10,542 --> 00:39:13,524
It's going to make the violent video game stuff look like nothing.

741
00:39:13,524 --> 00:39:15,345
And then there's going to be fines.

742
00:39:15,345 --> 00:39:19,607
So there's going to be a lot of compliance, and that's going to have two effects.

743
00:39:20,217 --> 00:39:25,318
The first effect is it's going to start siphoning giant amounts of money out of your organization.

744
00:39:25,318 --> 00:39:33,562
So Google can sustain 4.5 billion euros followed by 1.7 billion euros,

745
00:39:33,562 --> 00:39:40,104
and they can pay really, really clever lawyers to make that follow a diminishing function.

746
00:39:41,019 --> 00:39:43,380
I don't know how many gaming companies can sustain,

747
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:46,462
I don't even know if the big boys can sustain more than

748
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:48,823
a few billion dollars of direct fees or fines.

749
00:39:48,823 --> 00:39:51,725
And I don't think they can afford to leave the EU market.

750
00:39:51,725 --> 00:39:59,109
So in a lot of ways, there have been short-term victories

751
00:39:59,109 --> 00:40:01,270
that are going to lead to long-term defeats on this.

752
00:40:01,270 --> 00:40:03,912
I see someone wearing a Nintendo shirt

753
00:40:03,912 --> 00:40:05,753
and I think Nintendo might be fine actually.

754
00:40:07,879 --> 00:40:09,880
So, you know, what can we do?

755
00:40:09,880 --> 00:40:13,201
And I'm going to intentionally try to end a little early

756
00:40:13,201 --> 00:40:16,603
so we can have questions, not comments.

757
00:40:16,603 --> 00:40:20,164
What can you guys possibly do to turn a corner on this

758
00:40:20,164 --> 00:40:23,026
and to turn this defeat into an opportunity?

759
00:40:23,026 --> 00:40:29,008
You need to be proactive.

760
00:40:29,008 --> 00:40:32,570
There needs to be a fundamental shift.

761
00:40:33,427 --> 00:40:40,452
in your approach to something like gaming addiction or gaming and aggression or whatever.

762
00:40:40,452 --> 00:40:44,395
And there'll be other, I promise, there'll be other things that people will make up if

763
00:40:44,395 --> 00:40:46,316
addiction ever goes away to be afraid of.

764
00:40:47,157 --> 00:40:51,904
This is going to involve you considering what are your first principles.

765
00:40:51,904 --> 00:40:56,110
Articulate what do you want to be as developers,

766
00:40:56,110 --> 00:40:58,053
as responsible citizens,

767
00:40:58,053 --> 00:41:00,557
and designers of playgrounds for children.

768
00:41:00,557 --> 00:41:02,880
This is going to involve reading human rights law.

769
00:41:03,702 --> 00:41:09,787
So the UN Charter on the Rights of the Child say that young people have a right to information

770
00:41:09,787 --> 00:41:15,912
and they have a right to play. And if I have my way, they'll also have a right to play video games

771
00:41:15,912 --> 00:41:20,916
and other forms of entertainment when this gets revised because it's from the late 1980s.

772
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:26,122
The only way that we get there is if you're at the table.

773
00:41:26,122 --> 00:41:29,424
So LEGO has ethical design principles

774
00:41:29,424 --> 00:41:30,944
for their embodied toys.

775
00:41:30,944 --> 00:41:33,946
They check in with those before they build their environments.

776
00:41:33,946 --> 00:41:35,447
And I understand that LEGO environments

777
00:41:35,447 --> 00:41:37,828
are a little bit more constrained

778
00:41:37,828 --> 00:41:40,349
than League of Legends.

779
00:41:40,349 --> 00:41:42,930
But they've got a touchstone.

780
00:41:42,930 --> 00:41:46,092
And the touchstones in this industry are rather fragmented.

781
00:41:48,149 --> 00:41:50,770
I think that you need to be part of good science.

782
00:41:50,770 --> 00:41:52,291
I think you need to promote it.

783
00:41:52,291 --> 00:41:53,851
And there's a lot of ways that you can,

784
00:41:53,851 --> 00:41:56,452
and I'll detail some of them in a minute.

785
00:41:56,452 --> 00:41:58,994
And I think that you probably need to coordinate,

786
00:41:58,994 --> 00:42:02,435
because none of you are as big as a Google or a Facebook.

787
00:42:02,435 --> 00:42:05,776
And I really think that there needs to be,

788
00:42:05,776 --> 00:42:08,597
in the same way that the Free Pla...

789
00:42:08,597 --> 00:42:10,458
Wait.

790
00:42:10,458 --> 00:42:10,718
Fair?

791
00:42:10,718 --> 00:42:12,639
Fair Play Alliance, sorry.

792
00:42:13,327 --> 00:42:14,707
I have a sticker, I should check it.

793
00:42:14,707 --> 00:42:17,748
But in the same way that the Fair Play Alliance

794
00:42:17,748 --> 00:42:19,989
is trying to articulate a certain set of standards,

795
00:42:19,989 --> 00:42:22,950
I think you're gonna need that more broadly

796
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,711
to answer kind of the big questions of play.

797
00:42:24,711 --> 00:42:27,492
So it's not just about reaction.

798
00:42:27,492 --> 00:42:29,592
So I'm gonna close with this.

799
00:42:29,592 --> 00:42:37,835
I think you need to foster and model good science.

800
00:42:38,791 --> 00:42:44,843
I think that involves engaging in tactical and strategic data sharing.

801
00:42:44,843 --> 00:42:46,025
You need to think about...

802
00:42:46,358 --> 00:42:49,639
the kinds of data that you collect to improve your product

803
00:42:49,639 --> 00:42:51,320
or to monetize your product,

804
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:53,840
you need to think about that in terms of how that could be used

805
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:56,221
to improve our fundamental understanding

806
00:42:56,221 --> 00:43:00,702
of how billions of people spend tens of billions of hours

807
00:43:00,702 --> 00:43:03,403
of every week of their lives, hopefully having fun.

808
00:43:03,403 --> 00:43:06,184
This can involve data sharing,

809
00:43:06,184 --> 00:43:10,245
hackathons at different levels of education with your data.

810
00:43:10,245 --> 00:43:12,585
You get to figure out which kids are really the ones

811
00:43:12,585 --> 00:43:14,826
who are, you know, potentially hireable.

812
00:43:15,746 --> 00:43:21,668
You might consider funding an actual research organization to study play,

813
00:43:21,668 --> 00:43:23,668
kind of an extension of what's going on in the UX,

814
00:43:23,668 --> 00:43:26,709
UE space or user experience space right now.

815
00:43:26,709 --> 00:43:30,750
Think about collaborations with academics when you do them,

816
00:43:30,750 --> 00:43:35,412
not as like you bring in a Petri dish or not Petri dish,

817
00:43:35,412 --> 00:43:39,333
but like you bring in a sample of an academic or you share data with just him or her.

818
00:43:39,333 --> 00:43:42,114
But actually think about this as more of a team-based activity

819
00:43:42,114 --> 00:43:43,454
about joint knowledge production.

820
00:43:44,637 --> 00:43:50,819
And I think that really the defensiveness needs to stop,

821
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,179
or you'll all go extinct.

822
00:43:52,179 --> 00:43:55,060
There are things about games that are great,

823
00:43:55,060 --> 00:43:57,361
and there are probably things about games that aren't.

824
00:43:57,361 --> 00:44:01,902
And I think it's important that we know what those are,

825
00:44:01,902 --> 00:44:06,063
and we know how, that we're as sure about them

826
00:44:06,063 --> 00:44:08,443
as we are about our reasons for things like airplanes

827
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,664
staying in the air, all right?

828
00:44:10,664 --> 00:44:13,225
Because so much of ourselves are invested in these mediums.

829
00:44:13,521 --> 00:44:16,323
They're so amazing, and we owe it to everyone who plays

830
00:44:16,323 --> 00:44:18,005
to learn as much as we can.

831
00:44:18,005 --> 00:44:20,487
And that means we might find some scary stuff,

832
00:44:20,487 --> 00:44:23,189
but I firmly believe that everyone's

833
00:44:23,189 --> 00:44:26,272
entitled to their own opinions about art

834
00:44:26,272 --> 00:44:28,053
and about this medium, but they're not

835
00:44:28,053 --> 00:44:29,054
entitled to their own facts.

836
00:44:29,054 --> 00:44:31,536
So with that, I'm going to say thank you

837
00:44:31,536 --> 00:44:33,778
for your time and attention.

838
00:44:33,778 --> 00:44:36,681
And please, for the love of God, ask me questions.

839
00:44:48,382 --> 00:44:48,742
Hello.

840
00:44:48,742 --> 00:44:49,102
Hi.

841
00:44:49,102 --> 00:44:57,448
I'm someone with a deep interest in this to begin with.

842
00:44:57,448 --> 00:45:00,330
I work at Valve now as an economist, but prior to that,

843
00:45:00,330 --> 00:45:03,792
I spent about 14 years as a social policy researcher.

844
00:45:03,792 --> 00:45:06,654
So this is very dear to me, and I

845
00:45:06,654 --> 00:45:11,737
see what your point is about the bad evidence that's

846
00:45:11,737 --> 00:45:14,479
out there in the market right now.

847
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:20,426
You know, obviously you and we are interested in the actual truth about this.

848
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:27,852
And I'm wondering if we, as game companies, are to fund research or do partnerships, especially

849
00:45:27,852 --> 00:45:33,316
given that, you know, many game organizations are going to have interests in just showing

850
00:45:33,316 --> 00:45:40,662
the positive signs of gaming and not the negative, are we going to be combating bad science that

851
00:45:40,662 --> 00:45:45,626
says that gaming is a bad thing with bad science that says gaming is a good thing?

852
00:45:47,022 --> 00:45:50,624
That's a great question.

853
00:45:50,624 --> 00:45:56,147
And this is not a problem that is specific to games or the games

854
00:45:56,147 --> 00:45:56,347
industry.

855
00:45:56,347 --> 00:46:00,009
I think that it is a natural human instinct

856
00:46:00,009 --> 00:46:03,810
to want to see the positives of the things

857
00:46:03,810 --> 00:46:08,072
that we're most invested in and we love the most.

858
00:46:08,072 --> 00:46:12,535
I think fundamentally this comes down

859
00:46:12,535 --> 00:46:15,376
to whether or not the money, the data, the resources,

860
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,477
the cooperation.

861
00:46:16,975 --> 00:46:20,859
whether or not that's contingent on the findings.

862
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:22,780
So in the social sciences more broadly,

863
00:46:22,780 --> 00:46:24,302
and the medical sciences, there's

864
00:46:24,302 --> 00:46:26,844
a movement to something called pre-registration

865
00:46:26,844 --> 00:46:28,125
and registered reports.

866
00:46:28,125 --> 00:46:29,586
This is the idea that you write down

867
00:46:29,586 --> 00:46:31,308
what you're going to do before you do it,

868
00:46:31,308 --> 00:46:34,451
or it's peer reviewed before you collect your data.

869
00:46:34,451 --> 00:46:37,393
And that's the only way that this will work.

870
00:46:37,393 --> 00:46:40,716
So basically, this is why it requires

871
00:46:40,716 --> 00:46:43,979
open-mindedness and a certain level of letting go of control.

872
00:46:44,752 --> 00:46:47,372
because there will be things that,

873
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:50,393
but transparency is the thing that will save us on that.

874
00:46:50,393 --> 00:46:52,954
So you may not be able to share the exact data set

875
00:46:52,954 --> 00:46:54,535
that comes out of one of these collaborations

876
00:46:54,535 --> 00:46:57,096
or the projects, but you can create a simulated data

877
00:46:57,096 --> 00:46:59,437
depending on the class of data,

878
00:46:59,437 --> 00:47:02,998
which other people can question your code or your models.

879
00:47:03,577 --> 00:47:09,338
So well, I'm happy to follow that up, but there's a number of people unless you have one more just very small

880
00:47:09,338 --> 00:47:13,780
Yeah, I agree with everything you said about standards. I'd also advocate for

881
00:47:13,780 --> 00:47:22,162
Transparency and how data sets are created. Yes, because that's an important piece of it. Yes computational reproducibility is something that scientists are horrific

882
00:47:22,162 --> 00:47:27,844
Thank you. Everyone's horrific at it. You're welcome. I think there and then I'll alternate or not alternate obviously

883
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:30,138
Thank you.

884
00:47:30,138 --> 00:47:33,600
I find that when we act as advocates for games and

885
00:47:33,600 --> 00:47:36,182
ambassadors of our industry, and we have to defend

886
00:47:36,182 --> 00:47:40,364
ourselves against things like the internet gaming disorder

887
00:47:40,364 --> 00:47:44,767
classification and the certain kinds of studies, the bad

888
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:49,430
science studies, I find there's a real danger and

889
00:47:49,430 --> 00:47:53,292
tendency to dip into dogmaticism and, in some

890
00:47:53,292 --> 00:47:55,713
cases, come off as anti-intellectualism.

891
00:47:56,711 --> 00:48:04,493
What do you recommend, especially if we are not scientists or psychologists, how do we

892
00:48:04,493 --> 00:48:07,733
sort of avoid coming off that way?

893
00:48:07,733 --> 00:48:11,554
I think curiosity is the thing that's missing.

894
00:48:11,554 --> 00:48:20,436
So one of the real tragedies of both of concern-focused research in psychological science and in these

895
00:48:20,436 --> 00:48:24,297
other sciences is that there's actually a very low level of curiosity or interest in

896
00:48:24,297 --> 00:48:25,217
what the hell games are.

897
00:48:26,295 --> 00:48:28,916
And so when I was training as a scientist,

898
00:48:28,916 --> 00:48:30,637
I wanted to do studies on motivation.

899
00:48:30,637 --> 00:48:32,938
And so the way I learn is through examples.

900
00:48:32,938 --> 00:48:35,459
And so I'd have to read other lab studies.

901
00:48:35,459 --> 00:48:38,740
And it really ground me down, the lack of curiosity.

902
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:42,142
And so I think remembering that you're not

903
00:48:42,142 --> 00:48:44,263
going to lose your job if you listen

904
00:48:44,263 --> 00:48:47,485
to a parent who's flustered, or trying

905
00:48:47,485 --> 00:48:49,826
to identify if the person has, try

906
00:48:49,826 --> 00:48:52,587
to identify what their interest or where their passion comes

907
00:48:52,587 --> 00:48:54,548
from for arguing with you.

908
00:48:55,373 --> 00:48:58,654
uh... and i think that the insights you get i mean it's very banal when you get

909
00:48:58,654 --> 00:49:00,134
to the moral entrepreneurs

910
00:49:00,134 --> 00:49:04,015
for their whole reason for being is to sell a book and a consultancy etc etc

911
00:49:04,015 --> 00:49:05,816
you do not need to listen to those you can

912
00:49:05,816 --> 00:49:08,016
please feel free to argue with them

913
00:49:08,016 --> 00:49:12,417
but uh... i think a lot of people uh... just don't have a lot of clarity on

914
00:49:12,417 --> 00:49:15,298
what exactly they're unhappy about

915
00:49:15,298 --> 00:49:16,458
hope that helps

916
00:49:16,458 --> 00:49:17,538
absolutely thank you

917
00:49:18,660 --> 00:49:19,960
Sorry.

918
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:24,222
What do you think is the responsibility of conferences

919
00:49:24,222 --> 00:49:28,123
like GDC that host talks that teach dark patterns

920
00:49:28,123 --> 00:49:32,505
and promote the attention economy?

921
00:49:32,505 --> 00:49:39,967
I think in the first instance, we

922
00:49:39,967 --> 00:49:43,609
need to understand the reasons why those things either work

923
00:49:43,609 --> 00:49:46,550
or don't work on a very thorough level.

924
00:49:46,550 --> 00:49:47,370
So.

925
00:49:48,145 --> 00:49:54,169
You talk to, say, Tristan or these guys who are doing

926
00:49:54,169 --> 00:49:56,691
the time well spent movement.

927
00:49:56,691 --> 00:50:00,513
They're kind of like, they've come to their found Jesus

928
00:50:00,513 --> 00:50:00,853
moment.

929
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:02,615
They've decided that when they worked at Google,

930
00:50:02,615 --> 00:50:05,697
they were evil because they manipulated people.

931
00:50:05,697 --> 00:50:08,158
And now, they've realized that that was wrong.

932
00:50:08,158 --> 00:50:08,879
And now, they'll help.

933
00:50:08,879 --> 00:50:14,283
But when you ask them about the research that

934
00:50:14,855 --> 00:50:20,620
they're thinking that they were these kind of Oppenheimers of social control.

935
00:50:20,620 --> 00:50:24,344
They point at studies that are garbage from the social sciences.

936
00:50:24,344 --> 00:50:30,910
Like there was a Cornell professor, Brian Wansink, who like had this unending soup bowl

937
00:50:30,910 --> 00:50:33,353
experiment, but he's a fraudster.

938
00:50:33,353 --> 00:50:34,994
The experiment never worked.

939
00:50:34,994 --> 00:50:38,137
And these guys who think that they've, you know, fooled the world.

940
00:50:38,946 --> 00:50:40,947
you know, it's possible they still did.

941
00:50:40,947 --> 00:50:45,609
But the evidentiary basis for their claims, for good or bad,

942
00:50:45,609 --> 00:50:47,890
are kind of based on a whole series of assumptions.

943
00:50:47,890 --> 00:50:49,310
So I get tricked by dark patterns.

944
00:50:49,310 --> 00:50:52,431
It makes sense to me that that happens.

945
00:50:52,431 --> 00:50:57,153
But I think that the first duty of an organization

946
00:50:57,153 --> 00:50:57,934
is to actually

947
00:50:59,165 --> 00:51:03,753
document the phenomena closely, because if we regulate it without understanding it, or

948
00:51:03,753 --> 00:51:10,825
if we kind of set rules about it without understanding it, you know, it's a dinosaur's amber scenario.

949
00:51:10,825 --> 00:51:12,548
Is that good?

950
00:51:12,548 --> 00:51:13,209
Yeah, thanks.

951
00:51:13,209 --> 00:51:13,770
Appreciate it.

952
00:51:15,578 --> 00:51:16,959
Hi, hello.

953
00:51:16,959 --> 00:51:20,019
So regarding the iceberg metaphor analogy.

954
00:51:20,019 --> 00:51:22,900
It's a very strong boat, OK?

955
00:51:22,900 --> 00:51:24,060
It's moving quickly.

956
00:51:24,060 --> 00:51:27,341
Well, my question is, why do you think

957
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,481
that the boat will catch up with the iceberg?

958
00:51:29,481 --> 00:51:32,422
Because as it seems to me, like you said, every six months

959
00:51:32,422 --> 00:51:33,402
something new comes up.

960
00:51:33,402 --> 00:51:38,243
So what makes you believe that the regulators will actually

961
00:51:38,243 --> 00:51:38,623
catch up?

962
00:51:38,623 --> 00:51:41,024
Because they haven't been able to catch up.

963
00:51:41,024 --> 00:51:42,144
I mean, that's a.

964
00:51:42,304 --> 00:51:43,145
I don't know.

965
00:51:43,145 --> 00:51:43,625
For one.

966
00:51:43,625 --> 00:51:44,586
So I have two answers.

967
00:51:44,586 --> 00:51:50,870
One is polluted by my own experience, which is that I had years of my life where I wasn't

968
00:51:50,870 --> 00:51:55,373
on parliamentary, I wasn't giving evidence to parliamentary subcommittees on these topics,

969
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:58,315
and now an increasing amount of my time is spent doing that.

970
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:04,819
And I think it's just a matter of historic record that, you know.

971
00:52:05,715 --> 00:52:10,276
Different companies and countries different countries are looking more closely at these mechanics now

972
00:52:10,276 --> 00:52:14,217
So is your question is it happening or why is it happening?

973
00:52:14,217 --> 00:52:20,959
I mean will they ever catch up like because it seems to well, but we are developing new ways

974
00:52:20,959 --> 00:52:26,161
How do you do what they'll do the player right? So what they'll do is they'll write a rule that is

975
00:52:26,161 --> 00:52:30,883
Oh, I just remember the second part of an answer that I didn't give they'll write a rule

976
00:52:30,883 --> 00:52:33,203
That is like a catch-all rule

977
00:52:34,313 --> 00:52:42,377
And then when a company that's large enough to step out of line steps out of line, they'll sue it.

978
00:52:43,666 --> 00:52:45,547
Right, or the levy of fine.

979
00:52:45,547 --> 00:52:47,289
And sorry, that was the other thing I wanted to say,

980
00:52:47,289 --> 00:52:50,351
that it's not just the companies can't sustain these fines,

981
00:52:50,351 --> 00:52:53,073
it's that the cost of compliance is very high.

982
00:52:53,073 --> 00:52:57,296
So it may cut out smaller studios from certain markets.

983
00:52:57,296 --> 00:53:00,319
And then that's a real opportunity cost for human play.

984
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:01,399
Does that make sense?

985
00:53:01,399 --> 00:53:01,760
Yeah, okay, thanks.

986
00:53:01,760 --> 00:53:04,362
I mean, we can talk more about that.

987
00:53:04,362 --> 00:53:07,484
It's really boring, regulatory frameworks for me.

988
00:53:08,779 --> 00:53:08,819
Hi.

989
00:53:08,819 --> 00:53:09,420
Hi.

990
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:13,906
Would you say that screen addiction ties into video game

991
00:53:13,906 --> 00:53:16,950
addiction at all, or is that similar in that it is not

992
00:53:16,950 --> 00:53:19,574
entirely properly studied or even classified?

993
00:53:19,574 --> 00:53:21,156
It's entirely the same thing.

994
00:53:21,156 --> 00:53:21,436
Is it?

995
00:53:21,698 --> 00:53:26,842
Yeah, so you just take out, literally you can just take out the word video game and

996
00:53:26,842 --> 00:53:30,204
you can put in smartphone, screen, social media.

997
00:53:30,204 --> 00:53:35,709
It's all the same kind of miasm of social science.

998
00:53:35,709 --> 00:53:42,354
So the fundamental problem is that it's large-scale social data from surveys, and so because one

999
00:53:42,354 --> 00:53:43,635
person fills out the survey.

1000
00:53:44,276 --> 00:53:49,121
everything that they reply to has kind of a background level of correlation and

1001
00:53:49,121 --> 00:53:54,507
So things like I use a screen a certain number of hours a day, and I feel sad

1002
00:53:54,507 --> 00:53:58,090
Those things share one-third of 1% of covariance

1003
00:53:58,887 --> 00:54:01,389
And if all you care about is a p-value,

1004
00:54:01,389 --> 00:54:04,230
if all you care about is statistical significance,

1005
00:54:04,230 --> 00:54:05,611
then you can say something scary.

1006
00:54:05,611 --> 00:54:10,254
But I work by Amy Orbin and I on screen impacts.

1007
00:54:10,254 --> 00:54:13,876
You will overdose on that if you're interested.

1008
00:54:13,876 --> 00:54:14,236
Thank you.

1009
00:54:14,236 --> 00:54:14,556
Thank you.

1010
00:54:14,556 --> 00:54:16,677
And I think I can actually do the next two

1011
00:54:16,677 --> 00:54:19,459
in the next three minutes if they're reasonable, yes.

1012
00:54:19,917 --> 00:54:22,237
When it comes to the research organization,

1013
00:54:22,237 --> 00:54:24,378
are there any good examples in other industries

1014
00:54:24,378 --> 00:54:27,319
where that's actually been not a defensive thing?

1015
00:54:27,319 --> 00:54:29,480
Because everyone I'm aware of is a super defensive,

1016
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:32,081
like, makes it worse kind of organization.

1017
00:54:32,081 --> 00:54:33,021
Yeah, I don't know.

1018
00:54:33,021 --> 00:54:35,662
So I think, in my mind, the model is a,

1019
00:54:35,662 --> 00:54:37,543
there's something called

1020
00:54:37,543 --> 00:54:39,503
the Psychological Science Accelerator,

1021
00:54:39,503 --> 00:54:43,965
which is a coalition of hundreds of psychology labs

1022
00:54:43,965 --> 00:54:45,646
all around the world,

1023
00:54:45,646 --> 00:54:48,027
and we all run the same experiment at the same time.

1024
00:54:49,900 --> 00:54:53,282
And that way we know what we find is either there or not

1025
00:54:53,282 --> 00:54:53,502
there.

1026
00:54:53,502 --> 00:54:57,284
It's like Science Accelerator.

1027
00:54:57,284 --> 00:55:01,026
Unfortunately, all of the collaborations

1028
00:55:01,026 --> 00:55:03,488
that I'm aware of in the gambling, gaming industry,

1029
00:55:03,488 --> 00:55:07,090
that one, and different kind of health organizations

1030
00:55:07,090 --> 00:55:09,271
and governmental organizations, those have all failed.

1031
00:55:09,955 --> 00:55:15,520
pretty in different ways though spectacularly in different ways so they're their use cases, but

1032
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:21,846
But yeah, I'm writing a white paper on how it not how it cannot be a dumpster fire

1033
00:55:21,846 --> 00:55:24,228
And so it should work with Facebook too. I hope

1034
00:55:24,228 --> 00:55:24,369
Okay

1035
00:55:24,369 --> 00:55:28,272
All right one last one good a from Rochester

1036
00:55:28,568 --> 00:55:29,589
I'm from Yonkers.

1037
00:55:29,589 --> 00:55:30,950
Oh, well no one's perfect.

1038
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,691
Yeah.

1039
00:55:32,691 --> 00:55:36,292
So you talked a lot about, I really

1040
00:55:36,292 --> 00:55:37,933
like the slide where you were talking

1041
00:55:37,933 --> 00:55:40,495
about when you're addicted to drugs, it shows up.

1042
00:55:40,495 --> 00:55:43,336
And I think it really hit a note where we're

1043
00:55:43,336 --> 00:55:45,277
trying to isolate this X, right?

1044
00:55:45,277 --> 00:55:48,519
This X that is video game addiction.

1045
00:55:48,519 --> 00:55:50,660
And let's say 20, 30 years from now, every one of us

1046
00:55:50,660 --> 00:55:54,782
in this room knows exactly what makes a game addicting, right?

1047
00:55:54,782 --> 00:55:55,242
We've found X.

1048
00:55:55,242 --> 00:55:55,462
Yeah.

1049
00:55:55,722 --> 00:55:58,384
And I really think that at that point in time,

1050
00:55:58,384 --> 00:56:01,246
there's going to be a lot of companies, which I won't name names,

1051
00:56:01,246 --> 00:56:03,628
that want to be the Marlboro of games.

1052
00:56:03,628 --> 00:56:04,849
They don't care about morality.

1053
00:56:04,849 --> 00:56:06,810
They just want to make addicting games so people play them.

1054
00:56:06,810 --> 00:56:09,392
And there's going to be a lot of people who just want to make fun games

1055
00:56:09,392 --> 00:56:12,014
that are the opposite of whatever this X is, right?

1056
00:56:12,014 --> 00:56:15,436
And so how do you think that as, you know, a community,

1057
00:56:15,436 --> 00:56:16,757
we can deal with something like that?

1058
00:56:16,757 --> 00:56:18,638
Because I feel like that would literally tear,

1059
00:56:18,638 --> 00:56:20,720
like, the entire games industry apart.

1060
00:56:20,980 --> 00:56:25,721
So this is where I return to my facts versus opinions thing.

1061
00:56:25,721 --> 00:56:29,962
So if we actually have good scientific evidence

1062
00:56:29,962 --> 00:56:33,302
that this thing is an opioid, let's just

1063
00:56:33,302 --> 00:56:36,303
imagine it's a horrible, addictive thing.

1064
00:56:36,303 --> 00:56:40,284
It's kryptonite to children, but addictive kryptonite.

1065
00:56:40,284 --> 00:56:46,005
I think that if we have clarity on it,

1066
00:56:46,005 --> 00:56:48,166
if we have the facts on it, it'll

1067
00:56:48,166 --> 00:56:49,786
be very, very easy to regulate.

1068
00:56:51,161 --> 00:56:55,946
And it's not gonna be up to mom and pop game studio on a,

1069
00:56:55,946 --> 00:56:59,189
I don't know, they're gonna make like 3D augmented

1070
00:56:59,189 --> 00:57:00,771
body suits in this future that you have.

1071
00:57:00,771 --> 00:57:04,015
But it's not gonna be up to you to police them.

1072
00:57:04,015 --> 00:57:07,218
I think that if we have a common set of facts,

1073
00:57:07,218 --> 00:57:09,300
it'll be ridiculously easy to regulate them.

1074
00:57:09,300 --> 00:57:10,622
Okay. All right.

1075
00:57:10,622 --> 00:57:13,485
All right, I think that that is time.

1076
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:16,942
And I thank you all for your time and attention.

1077
00:57:16,942 --> 00:57:20,027
I don't know what the scale is, but if it's a 10-point scale, you give me a 10.

1078
00:57:20,027 --> 00:57:21,049
And if it's an 8, an 8.

1079
00:57:21,049 --> 00:57:21,690
All right?

1080
00:57:21,690 --> 00:57:22,631
All right.

1081
00:57:22,631 --> 00:57:24,174
Thank you so much.
