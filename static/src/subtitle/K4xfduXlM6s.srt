1
00:00:05,918 --> 00:00:06,858
Just a little bit of background,

2
00:00:06,959 --> 00:00:09,520
Situational Game Design is a book that I wrote.

3
00:00:10,721 --> 00:00:13,543
I'm going to talk a little bit about what's in it

4
00:00:13,703 --> 00:00:15,244
and why you might be interested in using it

5
00:00:15,284 --> 00:00:16,245
in an academic setting.

6
00:00:17,726 --> 00:00:20,167
Myself, I've been in the industry for over 20 years.

7
00:00:21,829 --> 00:00:23,831
I'm currently the chief creative officer

8
00:00:24,072 --> 00:00:27,497
at a little startup called Croquet Studios.

9
00:00:28,378 --> 00:00:30,821
If you've tried to reach me to do consulting work

10
00:00:30,941 --> 00:00:32,784
when I was freelancing, I'm very sorry

11
00:00:32,824 --> 00:00:34,606
that I haven't responded because we're starting

12
00:00:34,626 --> 00:00:36,048
a new studio and it's been crazy.

13
00:00:46,363 --> 00:00:49,825
So in order to explain why situational game design exists,

14
00:00:49,845 --> 00:00:51,887
I first have to explain a bit about my first book,

15
00:00:52,387 --> 00:00:53,288
The Aesthetic of Play.

16
00:00:53,788 --> 00:00:56,450
I wrote The Aesthetic of Play because I was troubled

17
00:00:56,490 --> 00:00:58,652
that my own thoughts about how game design worked

18
00:00:58,712 --> 00:01:01,614
weren't really reflected in what I was seeing

19
00:01:01,634 --> 00:01:02,675
in the existing literature.

20
00:01:03,175 --> 00:01:04,956
and the existing way people were talking about things,

21
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:08,097
and I wanted to basically lay out my own philosophy

22
00:01:08,157 --> 00:01:11,338
for how to design games and what the meaning of play is.

23
00:01:12,899 --> 00:01:14,379
As a book, it's an argument.

24
00:01:14,619 --> 00:01:16,680
It's an argument for a particular stance

25
00:01:16,760 --> 00:01:20,821
with relationship to play and towards game design,

26
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:23,202
but it's not really a teaching text.

27
00:01:23,262 --> 00:01:26,243
It was designed more as a polemic

28
00:01:26,323 --> 00:01:28,844
to convince people to think about play in certain ways.

29
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,444
So this was a problem because then I was approached a couple years ago by Brenda Romero,

30
00:01:40,884 --> 00:01:46,068
who said, essentially, I want to use your book to teach my undergrad class on game design.

31
00:01:46,889 --> 00:01:49,011
And I was very flattered, but my response was...

32
00:01:51,329 --> 00:01:52,650
I don't think that's a very good idea.

33
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:55,993
The reason why is because it really wasn't geared

34
00:01:56,053 --> 00:01:57,655
toward an undergrad audience.

35
00:01:57,755 --> 00:02:01,578
It was a whole bunch of really weird esoteric theory

36
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:03,600
about why I think I'm right,

37
00:02:04,100 --> 00:02:06,763
and not really anything about a practical methodology

38
00:02:06,883 --> 00:02:11,747
for how to actually make games

39
00:02:11,827 --> 00:02:13,188
using the techniques I was laying out.

40
00:02:16,192 --> 00:02:19,632
So as a result, being a good friend,

41
00:02:19,672 --> 00:02:21,533
I decided to write a book for her.

42
00:02:21,593 --> 00:02:22,813
And that wasn't the only reason,

43
00:02:22,853 --> 00:02:25,774
but I wanted to take the ideas that I'd put forth

44
00:02:25,814 --> 00:02:28,734
in The Aesthetic of Play and try to turn it into something

45
00:02:29,154 --> 00:02:31,995
that could actually be used both by undergrads

46
00:02:32,015 --> 00:02:33,175
and also by working designers.

47
00:02:33,215 --> 00:02:34,796
So it's not like, you're not,

48
00:02:35,296 --> 00:02:36,936
this is not something where you're trying to be convinced.

49
00:02:37,316 --> 00:02:39,537
This is like, here is a methodology that you can use

50
00:02:39,917 --> 00:02:42,057
to analyze games and to design games.

51
00:02:42,557 --> 00:02:44,218
And so that's basically what I'm gonna talk about.

52
00:02:44,758 --> 00:02:54,761
One of the things that prompted me to do this talk is because I gave a smaller talk on this subject at USC last fall as part of their Play Think series,

53
00:02:55,262 --> 00:02:59,343
and I discovered that they had actually adopted situational game design as one of their texts.

54
00:02:59,823 --> 00:03:03,264
And I thought, well, if USC likes it, then maybe other people would like it as well,

55
00:03:03,745 --> 00:03:09,007
and so maybe I could talk a little about it, and people could see if they were interested, and it would be useful for their own game design programs.

56
00:03:12,669 --> 00:03:15,590
So in order to describe what situational game design is,

57
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:18,410
I should first start with what we normally think of

58
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,611
as game design, what I call transactional game design.

59
00:03:22,611 --> 00:03:24,912
And in transactional game design,

60
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,612
we tend to focus on what the game does.

61
00:03:29,532 --> 00:03:33,053
We focus on the affordances that the game offers

62
00:03:33,093 --> 00:03:35,734
to the player, and we focus on the interactions

63
00:03:36,014 --> 00:03:36,574
that can occur.

64
00:03:37,914 --> 00:03:40,475
We think of play in transactional terms

65
00:03:40,916 --> 00:03:43,096
as being something that happens on the interface

66
00:03:43,136 --> 00:03:44,337
between player and game.

67
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,838
So the game lets you do certain things

68
00:03:47,178 --> 00:03:48,899
and in doing them you are playing.

69
00:03:49,679 --> 00:03:51,740
It's focused on getting good interactivity,

70
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,160
having good feedback loops,

71
00:03:53,621 --> 00:03:55,541
making sure that interface that exists

72
00:03:56,022 --> 00:03:57,822
between the player and the game

73
00:03:58,343 --> 00:04:01,464
is really crunchy and chewy and satisfying and wonderful

74
00:04:01,904 --> 00:04:03,224
because that's where all the play lives.

75
00:04:04,725 --> 00:04:07,726
So as a result, it's focused on how do we design the game.

76
00:04:07,766 --> 00:04:11,248
It's very game-centric, but it's also player agnostic.

77
00:04:11,288 --> 00:04:17,891
It kind of assumes that a good game is a good game for everybody and that games sort

78
00:04:17,911 --> 00:04:22,333
of exist as platonic ideals rather than something that is actually played

79
00:04:22,393 --> 00:04:25,754
by specific players with their own specific agendas.

80
00:04:30,213 --> 00:04:34,456
In contrast, situational design is extremely player-centric.

81
00:04:35,998 --> 00:04:41,042
In thinking about how I approach my own game designs,

82
00:04:42,363 --> 00:04:44,365
I don't think of the game as being something

83
00:04:44,405 --> 00:04:46,046
that stands apart from the player.

84
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:49,569
I think of the game as actually being something

85
00:04:50,069 --> 00:04:54,533
that exists as a fusion of an external rule set,

86
00:04:54,573 --> 00:04:56,034
an external set of constraints.

87
00:04:56,735 --> 00:05:04,180
and the internal set of predispositions and attitudes and strategies that the player brings

88
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:04,720
to the table.

89
00:05:05,320 --> 00:05:09,283
Play, in that case, is not centered on the interface between game and player, but play

90
00:05:09,343 --> 00:05:12,105
is centered in the mind of the player themselves.

91
00:05:12,825 --> 00:05:16,906
And so as a result, it allows you to analyze certain things

92
00:05:16,946 --> 00:05:19,166
that are a little hard if you think about everything

93
00:05:19,206 --> 00:05:20,526
being about interactivity.

94
00:05:20,986 --> 00:05:23,067
So for example, you can think about what happens

95
00:05:23,907 --> 00:05:25,687
when the player is holding very still

96
00:05:25,787 --> 00:05:27,427
and not actually interacting with the game,

97
00:05:27,467 --> 00:05:28,768
but is still enjoying themselves.

98
00:05:29,288 --> 00:05:30,788
You can think about in a turn-based game,

99
00:05:30,848 --> 00:05:33,769
what's going on in the off-turn experience

100
00:05:33,809 --> 00:05:35,929
where you're waiting for somebody else to move,

101
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:38,710
but you're still actively engaged in gameplay.

102
00:05:39,350 --> 00:05:43,192
you can think about the ways that it can be playful to experience a narrative

103
00:05:43,312 --> 00:05:45,454
or to experience an emotional moment in the game.

104
00:05:46,054 --> 00:05:49,236
And so as a result, whereas transactional game design is useful

105
00:05:49,256 --> 00:05:51,778
for certain sorts of very interactive heavy games,

106
00:05:52,678 --> 00:05:55,800
situational game design gives you a set of tools that you can use

107
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:58,422
to analyze these other sorts of experiences

108
00:05:58,882 --> 00:06:03,305
that we don't often think of as gameplay, but are still very, very playful.

109
00:06:04,207 --> 00:06:06,529
And so it's player-centric and also,

110
00:06:06,609 --> 00:06:07,710
as I'm gonna explain it a little bit,

111
00:06:07,991 --> 00:06:10,073
what I call a constraint agnostic.

112
00:06:10,473 --> 00:06:11,955
And I'm gonna explain that on the very next slide.

113
00:06:16,232 --> 00:06:17,673
So what is a constraint?

114
00:06:17,713 --> 00:06:19,474
Constraints are central to the notion

115
00:06:19,634 --> 00:06:21,014
of situational game design.

116
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,436
Constraints are anything that limits

117
00:06:24,696 --> 00:06:26,417
player action from moment to moment.

118
00:06:27,437 --> 00:06:31,459
So in most games, a rule is obviously a constraint.

119
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:35,341
But things like the layout of a play field are constraints.

120
00:06:35,361 --> 00:06:38,662
So the bounciness of a soccer ball

121
00:06:38,742 --> 00:06:41,023
is a constraint on how soccer is played.

122
00:06:41,443 --> 00:06:45,284
The layout of a level on a first-person shooter is a constraint on how it's played.

123
00:06:45,784 --> 00:06:49,405
And even things that we don't usually think of as being in-game are also constraints.

124
00:06:49,885 --> 00:06:53,446
So the physicality of a controller that you hold in your hands

125
00:06:53,586 --> 00:06:56,007
is also a constraint on the sorts of ways you can play,

126
00:06:56,387 --> 00:07:00,568
which is why you have a very different play experience if you're playing with mouse and keyboard

127
00:07:00,948 --> 00:07:03,629
or if you're playing with a console controller.

128
00:07:04,609 --> 00:07:07,650
But there's some other things beyond this that also count as constraints.

129
00:07:10,806 --> 00:07:13,608
And these are things that exist in the mind of the player.

130
00:07:14,029 --> 00:07:16,010
These are things like genre expectations.

131
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,632
So if you're playing a first-person shooter,

132
00:07:17,672 --> 00:07:20,854
you have certain assumptions that you bring to the game

133
00:07:21,215 --> 00:07:24,958
that stand outside of the system of constraints

134
00:07:25,398 --> 00:07:27,180
that the game itself imposes on you.

135
00:07:28,441 --> 00:07:30,202
You may have strategies that you adopt.

136
00:07:30,222 --> 00:07:33,064
You may know that doing certain things is a bad idea,

137
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:34,025
and so you don't do them.

138
00:07:34,345 --> 00:07:36,247
That counts as a constraint.

139
00:07:36,567 --> 00:07:40,490
Certain games are more fun if you know a lot

140
00:07:40,510 --> 00:07:41,331
about how to play them.

141
00:07:41,351 --> 00:07:43,232
So if you have a very steep learning curve,

142
00:07:43,252 --> 00:07:44,673
it might be like, well, this is really boring

143
00:07:44,693 --> 00:07:47,115
and frustrating, oh, but once you know everything about it,

144
00:07:47,496 --> 00:07:48,336
then it's interesting,

145
00:07:48,636 --> 00:07:50,498
because you have the right strategic constraints

146
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,119
in order to make something interesting to play.

147
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:58,385
And things like narrative flow or your sense of characterization, who it is you're playing.

148
00:07:58,985 --> 00:08:04,531
If you're playing somebody who is a hero, you may actually choose different actions while you're playing

149
00:08:04,571 --> 00:08:06,873
than if you're playing somebody who you think of as a villain.

150
00:08:08,454 --> 00:08:08,935
And finally...

151
00:08:10,311 --> 00:08:14,795
There are all sorts of what I call perversions or misunderstandings.

152
00:08:15,356 --> 00:08:21,001
Because the game you play is often not the game that is imposed upon you, the game that

153
00:08:21,041 --> 00:08:24,304
has been designed, but the game that you think you're playing.

154
00:08:25,204 --> 00:08:26,745
If you don't know certain things,

155
00:08:26,905 --> 00:08:29,426
or certain features exist within the game,

156
00:08:29,486 --> 00:08:31,207
then you won't actually use those features.

157
00:08:31,227 --> 00:08:33,088
They won't become part of the constraint space

158
00:08:33,648 --> 00:08:35,249
that describes how it plays.

159
00:08:35,769 --> 00:08:38,710
Or you may willfully decide to ignore them.

160
00:08:39,150 --> 00:08:41,632
So for example, you may play in perverse ways.

161
00:08:42,392 --> 00:08:44,013
Years ago when I was playing a lot of Doom,

162
00:08:44,253 --> 00:08:45,733
a group of us got together and tried to see

163
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:48,094
how big of a human pyramid we can build in Doom.

164
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:53,819
It was a complete perversity of how Doom was supposed to be played, but by imposing our

165
00:08:53,959 --> 00:08:57,742
own unusual and very strange constraints, we actually had a really good time with it.

166
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:03,046
And so, there are maybe all sorts of ways that you can play within a game's play space

167
00:09:03,086 --> 00:09:08,651
that are not constrained by the actual rules or built-in constraints of the game.

168
00:09:13,254 --> 00:09:18,121
So constraints are what define what I call a situation.

169
00:09:18,141 --> 00:09:21,967
A situation is a relatively stable set of constraints.

170
00:09:22,648 --> 00:09:25,733
It is a place you find yourself in playing the game

171
00:09:26,153 --> 00:09:28,938
where the constraints around you are not changing very much.

172
00:09:29,338 --> 00:09:34,862
Now, by relatively stable, I mean, you know, within the, within the, um, stable within

173
00:09:35,462 --> 00:09:39,906
the, um, the context of like a fraction of a second when you're actually making your gameplay decisions.

174
00:09:40,546 --> 00:09:44,189
So, if it's turn, if it's a turn-based game, your constraints might be, you know, stable for...

175
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:47,111
several minutes, but it's a fast-paced action game,

176
00:09:47,131 --> 00:09:48,732
your constraints may be relatively stable

177
00:09:48,772 --> 00:09:50,473
for a few milliseconds.

178
00:09:50,854 --> 00:09:53,115
But in any case, it gives you a way

179
00:09:53,216 --> 00:09:56,278
to get at the moment-to-moment experience

180
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,760
and form a model of something that's stable

181
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,580
that you can analyze.

182
00:10:00,381 --> 00:10:03,663
So a situation is composed of constraints.

183
00:10:04,084 --> 00:10:06,786
And then within a situation, you have moves.

184
00:10:07,066 --> 00:10:09,468
Moves are things that you can do in a situation.

185
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:13,050
They are things that are allowed to you by the constraints.

186
00:10:13,771 --> 00:10:16,132
And then finally, what makes a move a move

187
00:10:16,192 --> 00:10:18,194
is that a move is something that changes your constraints.

188
00:10:18,974 --> 00:10:22,616
So that every gameplay experience or every play experience

189
00:10:22,816 --> 00:10:25,898
can be understood as a continual motion through this cycle

190
00:10:26,479 --> 00:10:27,859
where you have a set of constraints

191
00:10:27,999 --> 00:10:29,260
that structure a situation.

192
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,722
Within that situation, you have a set of moves.

193
00:10:31,842 --> 00:10:33,042
You pick one of those moves

194
00:10:33,102 --> 00:10:34,503
that changes the set of constraints

195
00:10:34,583 --> 00:10:35,824
and now you're in a new situation.

196
00:10:36,384 --> 00:10:39,286
And this gives us a way to have a theoretical model

197
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,927
of what is happening moment to moment

198
00:10:40,947 --> 00:10:41,808
in the mind of the player

199
00:10:41,868 --> 00:10:43,048
as they're moving forward through a game.

200
00:10:47,616 --> 00:10:51,398
So anything that changes the constraints is a move.

201
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:53,659
Pressing a button on a controller obviously is a move.

202
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:56,421
But many moves can happen entirely

203
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:57,802
inside the player's head.

204
00:10:58,542 --> 00:11:01,303
So if you're playing a game like Portal

205
00:11:01,684 --> 00:11:05,626
and you're standing staring at a puzzle room

206
00:11:05,646 --> 00:11:08,687
that has a bunch of different possible solutions,

207
00:11:09,348 --> 00:11:13,010
You're actively engaged, you're actively working through a set of moves,

208
00:11:13,330 --> 00:11:16,692
but the moves that you're working through are not ones that you're making in the game,

209
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:18,693
in the external game,

210
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:21,074
they're moves that you're making entirely in your head.

211
00:11:21,575 --> 00:11:24,036
You're moving from one situation to another,

212
00:11:24,076 --> 00:11:26,537
one internal situation to another within your own mind.

213
00:11:27,898 --> 00:11:34,400
And what makes a puzzle game like this interesting is the way these internal situations are structured.

214
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,502
So that is, you're moving from one, considering one possibility to another.

215
00:11:38,942 --> 00:11:47,805
You have the right number of possible permutations of moves that you can select in order to move forward.

216
00:11:55,521 --> 00:11:58,303
So what this gives us, the notion of the situation,

217
00:11:58,964 --> 00:12:01,947
gives us a way to conceptualize the moment-to-moment

218
00:12:01,967 --> 00:12:03,228
experience of playing a game.

219
00:12:04,008 --> 00:12:06,230
And it gives us a way to analyze this experience,

220
00:12:06,791 --> 00:12:09,953
so that if you have a student who's designing a game

221
00:12:09,973 --> 00:12:12,335
and they're not sure why something isn't working properly,

222
00:12:12,776 --> 00:12:14,217
or you're trying to do a critique of a game,

223
00:12:14,237 --> 00:12:15,678
you're like, you know, I'm playing this

224
00:12:15,698 --> 00:12:18,140
and it's just not fun, what's wrong here?

225
00:12:18,761 --> 00:12:23,307
Breaking things down into situations and trying to understand the situations

226
00:12:23,387 --> 00:12:25,470
it's structuring can often give you these answers.

227
00:12:26,435 --> 00:12:31,820
So in any moment you can say, okay, what constraints is the player actually operating under here?

228
00:12:32,181 --> 00:12:34,163
What are the limitations in the player's behavior?

229
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:38,907
And what assumptions might I be making about limitations in the player's behavior

230
00:12:39,448 --> 00:12:42,371
that I am not taking into account?

231
00:12:43,071 --> 00:12:49,178
Is this game boring because the players have discovered master strategies that have eliminated all their choices?

232
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:53,040
Is it frustrating because they don't know the things they need to know?

233
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:59,584
Trying to identify the constraints that exist in a situation can often give you a way to analyze

234
00:12:59,664 --> 00:13:02,146
whether it is working or not as a play experience.

235
00:13:03,787 --> 00:13:06,889
And then knowing what moves you can make as a result.

236
00:13:07,089 --> 00:13:14,093
So recognizing in a situation the tensions that exist between moves and constraints

237
00:13:14,513 --> 00:13:16,355
can help answer game design questions.

238
00:13:19,795 --> 00:13:21,676
So once you look at a situation,

239
00:13:22,797 --> 00:13:26,440
what I also provide is a set of heuristics rules

240
00:13:27,041 --> 00:13:29,543
for determining whether a situation

241
00:13:29,643 --> 00:13:31,504
should theoretically be playable or not,

242
00:13:32,045 --> 00:13:32,785
or playful or not.

243
00:13:34,166 --> 00:13:36,989
This is a set of general principles

244
00:13:37,409 --> 00:13:41,292
for what makes situations interesting for us to be in.

245
00:13:43,034 --> 00:13:47,115
And it's broken down into six different heuristics.

246
00:13:49,336 --> 00:13:50,436
If you want to know more detail,

247
00:13:50,456 --> 00:13:52,737
I don't have time to really go into them in a lot of detail,

248
00:13:52,757 --> 00:13:56,958
but I can explain briefly what the theory behind it is.

249
00:13:58,058 --> 00:14:01,639
We like situations where we have a handful of moves,

250
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:06,360
where we have three to seven different possibilities

251
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,820
that are meaningful to choose between.

252
00:14:09,044 --> 00:14:11,348
If we don't have enough, a game feels boring.

253
00:14:11,888 --> 00:14:13,931
And if we have too many, a game feels confusing.

254
00:14:14,051 --> 00:14:16,094
And so when you're looking at situations,

255
00:14:16,555 --> 00:14:18,518
you think, what are the meaningful moves

256
00:14:18,558 --> 00:14:19,579
that a player can make here?

257
00:14:19,760 --> 00:14:22,584
And do I give them too many or too few?

258
00:14:23,862 --> 00:14:25,543
Situations also can't repeat.

259
00:14:25,904 --> 00:14:28,106
You need to have situations that,

260
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:30,949
you need to be continually encountering new situations.

261
00:14:31,509 --> 00:14:34,432
The reason for this is because your memory

262
00:14:34,492 --> 00:14:37,555
of your previous, of a previous move

263
00:14:37,575 --> 00:14:40,999
you make within a situation affects your,

264
00:14:41,359 --> 00:14:43,341
becomes a constraint upon your new moves.

265
00:14:43,762 --> 00:14:46,304
So if you encounter the same situation over and over again

266
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,006
and you've already picked a move that you like,

267
00:14:48,905 --> 00:14:49,746
and you're happy with it,

268
00:14:50,226 --> 00:14:51,848
you will automatically pick that move.

269
00:14:51,928 --> 00:14:53,350
And now this new constraint,

270
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,111
your knowledge of what you've done before,

271
00:14:56,513 --> 00:14:57,894
reduces the number of moves

272
00:14:58,014 --> 00:14:59,736
from what might have been an interesting number

273
00:14:59,756 --> 00:15:00,877
the first time you encountered it

274
00:15:01,057 --> 00:15:02,339
into just a single move,

275
00:15:02,779 --> 00:15:04,000
and the situation becomes boring.

276
00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:07,067
The moves need to have consequences.

277
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:09,570
This is kind of baked into the definition for moves.

278
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:12,012
Moves need to change the constraints.

279
00:15:12,552 --> 00:15:14,474
If a move does not take you to a new situation,

280
00:15:14,534 --> 00:15:16,055
if it feels empty or pointless,

281
00:15:16,596 --> 00:15:19,358
then you're sort of by default

282
00:15:19,398 --> 00:15:21,300
are repeating the same situation over and over again.

283
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,721
That makes it less interesting.

284
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:25,260
They need to be predictable.

285
00:15:25,780 --> 00:15:29,844
When we choose moves, we need to have a reason to choose one move over another.

286
00:15:30,284 --> 00:15:34,408
We need to feel like we are accomplishing something when we choose moves in a situation.

287
00:15:35,088 --> 00:15:37,711
And in order for that to happen, the move has to be predictable.

288
00:15:38,091 --> 00:15:42,635
We have to be able to run through a chain of possible moves in our head and see that

289
00:15:42,655 --> 00:15:46,759
it might probably arrive at a future situation that we find desirable.

290
00:15:47,719 --> 00:15:51,461
Whether because it leads us towards winning, or because it answers some question we have about the game,

291
00:15:51,561 --> 00:15:57,102
or because it allows us to perform some role within the make-believe that we have of the game,

292
00:15:57,503 --> 00:16:03,044
we want to feel like our moves have consequences and that we can determine what those consequences are.

293
00:16:03,845 --> 00:16:06,406
But at the same time, they can't be too predictable.

294
00:16:06,426 --> 00:16:09,988
We can't be absolutely sure that the moves we make in a situation will give us the result

295
00:16:10,028 --> 00:16:15,351
we want because otherwise we could run through future situations in our head.

296
00:16:15,671 --> 00:16:21,415
This is the mirror of having situations that get played out because we encounter the same

297
00:16:21,575 --> 00:16:22,775
situation over and over again.

298
00:16:23,156 --> 00:16:28,419
If I'm able to run through a long chain of situations by imagining all the moves that

299
00:16:28,439 --> 00:16:29,079
I'm going to make,

300
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,800
then it becomes boring when I actually get around

301
00:16:31,820 --> 00:16:32,600
to making those moves.

302
00:16:32,640 --> 00:16:34,420
I've already made the choices in advance

303
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:35,321
and I've already taken,

304
00:16:35,761 --> 00:16:37,541
I've already used up all the fun.

305
00:16:38,342 --> 00:16:40,522
This is an example where, in a chess game,

306
00:16:40,562 --> 00:16:43,503
where the end of a game is a foregone conclusion,

307
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:45,644
someone may say something like mate in three.

308
00:16:45,664 --> 00:16:47,184
Well, there's no point in actually playing

309
00:16:47,224 --> 00:16:48,684
because everybody knows how it's going to go

310
00:16:48,724 --> 00:16:51,625
and at that point, there is no more play left

311
00:16:52,325 --> 00:16:54,326
in the situations that you'll be encountering.

312
00:16:56,250 --> 00:16:57,391
And finally is satisfaction.

313
00:16:58,011 --> 00:16:59,091
It's not enough to know where you're going,

314
00:16:59,111 --> 00:17:01,192
but you want to be able to pick moves

315
00:17:01,212 --> 00:17:03,392
that lead you at least in,

316
00:17:04,673 --> 00:17:07,173
that offer the possibility of success.

317
00:17:07,873 --> 00:17:11,514
So you want to be able to choose moves

318
00:17:11,554 --> 00:17:12,795
that you think will help you win

319
00:17:12,935 --> 00:17:14,475
or that will give you some other reward

320
00:17:14,575 --> 00:17:17,916
as either personal or internal as you're playing the game.

321
00:17:21,121 --> 00:17:22,342
So in order for all this to work,

322
00:17:22,602 --> 00:17:24,163
you really need to come into this

323
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:25,604
thinking about who's your player,

324
00:17:25,704 --> 00:17:29,627
and not who's your player in the very vague sort of,

325
00:17:32,164 --> 00:17:35,245
Oh, we're targeting the action adventure demographic,

326
00:17:35,346 --> 00:17:42,310
or we're intending this to be about fans of fighting games.

327
00:17:43,271 --> 00:17:46,453
You need to try to get yourself into the mind of the player

328
00:17:46,533 --> 00:17:49,575
and think through what sort of constraints

329
00:17:49,615 --> 00:17:50,896
they might be bringing to the table.

330
00:17:51,596 --> 00:17:57,678
So that different people from different backgrounds, from different ages, different ethnicities, different genders,

331
00:17:58,178 --> 00:18:02,559
people will bring different pre-existing constraints to the game.

332
00:18:02,639 --> 00:18:09,021
And so when you're thinking about assembling a set of constraints that will offer interesting situations,

333
00:18:09,061 --> 00:18:10,521
a lot of times what you need to do is be thinking,

334
00:18:10,601 --> 00:18:10,801
okay,

335
00:18:11,262 --> 00:18:14,164
What assumptions am I making about the player?

336
00:18:14,844 --> 00:18:16,665
No game exists entirely with,

337
00:18:17,726 --> 00:18:20,168
that is entirely self-contained.

338
00:18:20,488 --> 00:18:22,729
We all make assumptions when we're designing games

339
00:18:23,089 --> 00:18:25,691
that players will bring certain pre-existing constraints.

340
00:18:26,492 --> 00:18:28,293
Sometimes these constraints are drawn entirely

341
00:18:28,333 --> 00:18:29,113
from the real world.

342
00:18:29,193 --> 00:18:31,095
So if you make a driving game,

343
00:18:31,415 --> 00:18:32,956
you kind of assume that even if people

344
00:18:33,096 --> 00:18:34,017
don't know how to drive,

345
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:36,358
they know in general what driving is

346
00:18:36,398 --> 00:18:37,559
and what the rules of the road are.

347
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:45,603
And so simulation games rely heavily on people having a sense of what they're supposed to be doing before they start to play.

348
00:18:46,063 --> 00:18:50,706
And so when you think about how to design games using situational game design,

349
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:56,349
a big part of it is thinking about who is going to be playing it and how are they going to change as they're playing.

350
00:19:00,299 --> 00:19:02,721
So this is kind of reiterating what I just said,

351
00:19:02,741 --> 00:19:05,323
but play is the intersection between a well-designed game

352
00:19:05,383 --> 00:19:06,244
and a suitable player.

353
00:19:06,725 --> 00:19:09,708
We create sets of rules, we create the game as designed,

354
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:12,931
and then the player brings their own internal constraints,

355
00:19:14,112 --> 00:19:15,694
both that they had previously

356
00:19:15,934 --> 00:19:17,335
and their understanding of the game,

357
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,417
and it is the intersection of those two

358
00:19:19,718 --> 00:19:21,740
that produces the play space where play emerges.

359
00:19:24,795 --> 00:19:28,056
But more importantly, this is not a static system.

360
00:19:28,136 --> 00:19:30,257
Games will change us as we play them.

361
00:19:30,897 --> 00:19:34,199
So as you are playing a game,

362
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:37,560
you are constantly developing new constraints

363
00:19:38,261 --> 00:19:40,361
based upon what you're learning from playing the game.

364
00:19:40,762 --> 00:19:42,483
You have new ways of understanding the game,

365
00:19:42,503 --> 00:19:44,164
you have new strategies you're developing,

366
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,644
you try something out and it fails,

367
00:19:45,664 --> 00:19:47,906
you're like, oh, that was wrong, I shouldn't do that.

368
00:19:48,446 --> 00:19:50,387
And so, when we're thinking about designing

369
00:19:50,427 --> 00:19:52,288
these constraints, we're not just designing

370
00:19:52,368 --> 00:19:54,710
for one assumed player, we're designing

371
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:57,491
for an assumed player who's going to be evolving

372
00:19:57,531 --> 00:20:00,533
through time in response to the problems

373
00:20:00,573 --> 00:20:01,614
that we were posing for them.

374
00:20:02,394 --> 00:20:05,935
So in many ways we can think about that if somebody is really into a game,

375
00:20:06,236 --> 00:20:10,037
and if you don't just abandon a game because you're not interested in it,

376
00:20:10,537 --> 00:20:15,439
then what happens is that you are becoming the player that you need to be

377
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,240
in order to play through a game.

378
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:20,141
And that gives us a very powerful tool for thinking about

379
00:20:20,241 --> 00:20:22,722
how games can actually affect and influence people.

380
00:20:26,027 --> 00:20:29,592
So when we talk, this is another advantage of situational game design,

381
00:20:29,632 --> 00:20:32,757
is it gives us a really concrete way to get at what games mean.

382
00:20:33,698 --> 00:20:36,062
Meaning is not what a game tells us.

383
00:20:36,362 --> 00:20:39,286
It is not a didactic exercise in a game instructing us.

384
00:20:41,585 --> 00:20:45,567
Meaning is the residue of the experience that we have while we play the game.

385
00:20:46,067 --> 00:20:52,990
Meaning is what we have learned to be in order to successfully play the game.

386
00:20:53,470 --> 00:20:57,592
And so that games that are very, very meaningful to us are games that reinforce particular

387
00:20:57,652 --> 00:21:00,933
patterns of behavior that then linger with us afterwards.

388
00:21:00,953 --> 00:21:02,374
They give us ways of being.

389
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:09,958
in a playful world where we were rewarded for adopting certain attitudes and certain strategies.

390
00:21:10,499 --> 00:21:13,020
And then those attitudes and strategies persist after they've gone.

391
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:15,322
They are the residue of the play experience.

392
00:21:17,363 --> 00:21:20,385
So really quickly, because I only have half an hour and I want to have a little time for questions.

393
00:21:20,865 --> 00:21:23,867
So you can think about how we put this all together in order to

394
00:21:24,347 --> 00:21:28,709
have a coherent model for designing games within this.

395
00:21:29,871 --> 00:21:33,013
And this is how I approach it.

396
00:21:33,053 --> 00:21:34,754
I start off with an intended experience.

397
00:21:34,954 --> 00:21:40,497
There is something I want players to feel, some way I want them to be

398
00:21:40,577 --> 00:21:42,098
within the games that I am creating.

399
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:43,358
And then.

400
00:21:44,245 --> 00:21:48,969
that way of being within the world will lead to a set of performative moves,

401
00:21:49,029 --> 00:21:51,331
because since meaning is the residue of experience,

402
00:21:51,491 --> 00:21:55,554
the experience I want to deliver is composed of performative actions

403
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,775
that they will perform in the context of the game.

404
00:21:58,776 --> 00:22:02,038
These performative actions will merge out of situations,

405
00:22:02,138 --> 00:22:07,202
so that if I want to create particular actions that give a particular feeling to a game,

406
00:22:07,582 --> 00:22:12,525
I need to design situations that are going to make those actions emerge naturally and

407
00:22:12,565 --> 00:22:14,427
fluidly where I wanted those actions.

408
00:22:14,447 --> 00:22:18,529
I'm not doing it because I'm told to, but because that's what it seems natural to do.

409
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:23,172
And then the design of those situations is constrained by the heuristics of play, so

410
00:22:23,192 --> 00:22:28,856
that in order to keep people engaged in making these performative moves, we need to structure

411
00:22:28,896 --> 00:22:32,038
situations that from moment to moment will keep them continually engaged.

412
00:22:33,599 --> 00:22:36,201
The need to have these situations gives us an idea

413
00:22:36,221 --> 00:22:37,762
of what sort of constraints we need to have,

414
00:22:37,943 --> 00:22:39,684
what are the limitations that we put on the player,

415
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:42,947
and in particular, what assumptions do we make

416
00:22:42,988 --> 00:22:44,849
about what the player already has as constraints,

417
00:22:44,889 --> 00:22:46,931
and what is the minimal amount of constraints

418
00:22:46,951 --> 00:22:48,573
that we can add to what they already have

419
00:22:48,953 --> 00:22:50,955
to structure these sort of playful situations?

420
00:22:51,676 --> 00:22:55,259
And finally, the need to generate these constraints

421
00:22:55,860 --> 00:22:58,482
gives us a way to get at the game system.

422
00:22:59,123 --> 00:23:08,189
So that the system we are creating is step by step produced from the experiences we are

423
00:23:08,229 --> 00:23:09,830
intending to evoke in the player.

424
00:23:10,230 --> 00:23:15,773
We are creating a system that will contain constraints, that will interact with constraints

425
00:23:15,814 --> 00:23:20,056
that the player already has, that will structure the situations we want, that will be playful

426
00:23:20,096 --> 00:23:20,476
in a way.

427
00:23:20,837 --> 00:23:22,137
that will keep the player engaged.

428
00:23:22,658 --> 00:23:25,299
And as a result of that, they'll have a set of performative moves

429
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,942
that will reinforce certain either understandings or strategies

430
00:23:30,402 --> 00:23:33,364
within the player that will linger with them after the game is over

431
00:23:33,684 --> 00:23:36,746
and gives us a way to actually convey something meaningful, hopefully,

432
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:39,768
to players who are part of receptive audiences.

433
00:23:42,890 --> 00:23:45,972
Thank you very much. That's it in a nutshell.

434
00:23:45,992 --> 00:23:46,952
Thank you.

435
00:23:48,574 --> 00:23:52,536
It's kind of hard to summarize an entire book in 25 minutes.

436
00:23:52,696 --> 00:23:55,757
But there's a whole lot more in the book

437
00:23:55,817 --> 00:23:58,718
about designing goals and anticipation

438
00:23:58,758 --> 00:24:00,178
and how this all ties into narrative.

439
00:24:00,899 --> 00:24:02,979
But this at least gives you a background

440
00:24:03,180 --> 00:24:04,940
and gives you a sense of whether this might be something

441
00:24:04,980 --> 00:24:06,001
that you're at all interested in.

442
00:24:06,941 --> 00:24:08,421
And so now if there are questions,

443
00:24:08,922 --> 00:24:11,903
there is a microphone and these lights are in my eyes

444
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,644
and I have no idea if anybody actually goes to it or not.

445
00:24:14,704 --> 00:24:14,904
So.

446
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:16,825
Hello?

447
00:24:17,366 --> 00:24:18,790
Yes, I can kind of see you.

448
00:24:18,951 --> 00:24:20,455
Okay, cool.

449
00:24:20,655 --> 00:24:21,999
So where I teach,

450
00:24:22,681 --> 00:24:24,867
Breda University of Applied Sciences in the Netherlands.

451
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:31,354
We're very much focused on what you described as the transactional model at the start there,

452
00:24:31,895 --> 00:24:37,361
and then after a couple of projects we jump straight to, we're very focused on like the

453
00:24:37,521 --> 00:24:42,766
Ubisoft rational game design, really deep dive, like what are your parameters, what are your

454
00:24:43,287 --> 00:24:48,852
variables kind of approach. Do you have any experience with that Ubisoft kind of model or

455
00:24:48,892 --> 00:24:49,773
that kind of level of...

456
00:24:51,094 --> 00:24:53,596
Not really, because I've kind of been designing this way

457
00:24:53,616 --> 00:24:54,936
for my entire professional career.

458
00:24:54,956 --> 00:24:55,036
Okay.

459
00:24:56,517 --> 00:24:57,738
So, yeah.

460
00:24:57,818 --> 00:25:00,839
It sounds very much like this sits between those two concepts,

461
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,620
and we have noticed we have a gap there,

462
00:25:02,660 --> 00:25:03,620
so this is really interesting.

463
00:25:04,341 --> 00:25:06,202
Cool. Yeah, actually, I'm supposed to repeat the questions.

464
00:25:06,222 --> 00:25:08,583
The question was whether this ties in at all

465
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:12,365
with Ubisoft's model of rational game design.

466
00:25:12,805 --> 00:25:14,926
Okay. Yep. Thank you.

467
00:25:15,166 --> 00:25:15,326
Sure.

468
00:25:19,148 --> 00:25:19,808
Is there anybody else?

469
00:25:24,920 --> 00:25:26,062
I think that may be it then.

470
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:30,231
Thank you very much and enjoy the rest of the session,

471
00:25:30,652 --> 00:25:31,434
or the rest of the show.
