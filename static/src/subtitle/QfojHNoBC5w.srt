1
00:00:06,062 --> 00:00:08,143
My name's David, and I'm here to talk about

2
00:00:08,183 --> 00:00:10,043
the flappy bird that laid the golden egg.

3
00:00:11,103 --> 00:00:13,163
So, just briefly about me,

4
00:00:13,404 --> 00:00:17,524
and why I care about hypercasual games.

5
00:00:17,584 --> 00:00:19,465
So, probably like a lot of you,

6
00:00:19,525 --> 00:00:21,845
been making hypercasual games for a very, very long time.

7
00:00:22,585 --> 00:00:25,306
Didn't call them that, didn't know it was hypercasual.

8
00:00:25,406 --> 00:00:28,666
But any mini games, little prototypes,

9
00:00:28,686 --> 00:00:31,687
little plays with mechanics, little twitchy loops,

10
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:32,887
little arcadey things.

11
00:00:33,567 --> 00:00:39,589
been doing that forever for various brands and mini games and websites. We've also done a few

12
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:46,911
what are now called idle games. So, Milk Me Winer, High Profits, with these side games.

13
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:53,293
And we're working on an I.O. game, so a multiplayer hyper casual game coming out, and we're excited to

14
00:00:54,013 --> 00:00:58,535
see how that goes. So, you know, the interesting thing about hyper casual is

15
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:00,520
How did we get here?

16
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:02,462
How did this become a thing, right?

17
00:01:02,562 --> 00:01:04,663
Just as a quick spoiler a little later on,

18
00:01:04,683 --> 00:01:05,624
we're gonna show you some numbers,

19
00:01:05,684 --> 00:01:08,866
and basically half the downloads in mobile are hypercasual.

20
00:01:10,227 --> 00:01:10,787
How did that happen?

21
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,213
So you can really blame this guy, Dong Nguyen,

22
00:01:19,253 --> 00:01:20,194
and this is what Dong did.

23
00:01:21,495 --> 00:01:21,915
Please count.

24
00:01:23,756 --> 00:01:24,217
Please count.

25
00:01:25,298 --> 00:01:25,478
Oh, shit.

26
00:01:25,498 --> 00:01:25,578
What?

27
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:28,900
So.

28
00:01:32,444 --> 00:01:33,384
Actually, I need that back, sorry.

29
00:01:35,325 --> 00:01:36,906
Ooh, the spotlight too.

30
00:01:37,266 --> 00:01:40,528
All right, so Dong was inspired by that very activity,

31
00:01:40,548 --> 00:01:42,068
in fact I think it was the even stupider one

32
00:01:42,108 --> 00:01:45,710
with the elastic attached to it, and to make a game.

33
00:01:46,110 --> 00:01:48,792
So he was a programmer in Vietnam,

34
00:01:49,452 --> 00:01:52,413
and he coded a game in three days called Flappy Bird.

35
00:01:52,613 --> 00:01:54,474
So who here has played Flappy Bird?

36
00:01:54,494 --> 00:01:56,855
Okay, now raise your other hand.

37
00:01:58,776 --> 00:01:59,117
Now flap.

38
00:02:00,357 --> 00:02:01,037
No, come on.

39
00:02:01,418 --> 00:02:01,958
Looks so cool.

40
00:02:02,659 --> 00:02:02,940
All right.

41
00:02:04,041 --> 00:02:07,985
So Dong, just a hobbyist guy, kind of messing around.

42
00:02:08,225 --> 00:02:10,368
He wanted to make a game that was just incredibly simple.

43
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:12,851
And really, the game was mindless.

44
00:02:12,931 --> 00:02:14,853
And I say this with genuine respect.

45
00:02:17,454 --> 00:02:19,234
almost in a zen level of mindlessness.

46
00:02:21,195 --> 00:02:23,016
You lose your mind, you lose your concept of mind

47
00:02:23,036 --> 00:02:23,736
when you're playing the game.

48
00:02:23,776 --> 00:02:25,837
It's a one-touch game, you're touching it,

49
00:02:26,297 --> 00:02:28,478
there's pipes, there's birds, and there's a score.

50
00:02:29,518 --> 00:02:32,079
You live that score, you need to beat that score,

51
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,579
and before you know it, hours have passed.

52
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:37,341
Right, so, that said, it was a crappy game, right?

53
00:02:37,361 --> 00:02:39,321
It was a crappy, simple, little, hyper-casual game.

54
00:02:40,615 --> 00:02:42,556
But 50 million downloads later,

55
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:45,178
publishers started paying attention.

56
00:02:46,459 --> 00:02:47,460
Hobbyists started paying attention.

57
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,101
Everyone started saying, how do we do this?

58
00:02:50,001 --> 00:02:51,682
How do we replicate this success?

59
00:02:52,323 --> 00:02:55,685
In fact, the initial launch of Flappy Bird

60
00:02:55,765 --> 00:02:56,786
had no ads in it.

61
00:02:57,326 --> 00:02:59,247
And eventually, Dong was so overwhelmed

62
00:02:59,287 --> 00:03:00,588
by all of the success of the game,

63
00:03:00,628 --> 00:03:01,469
he took it down.

64
00:03:02,829 --> 00:03:06,172
So publishers started playing with this model

65
00:03:06,552 --> 00:03:07,032
and doing what...

66
00:03:08,211 --> 00:03:10,253
you know, I think looking back we can call super casual.

67
00:03:10,734 --> 00:03:13,637
So they took casual games, which were deeper,

68
00:03:13,737 --> 00:03:17,981
but mass market games, and took these simple mechanics,

69
00:03:18,181 --> 00:03:20,323
often borrowed from historical great games

70
00:03:20,384 --> 00:03:22,486
like Crossy Road, borrowing from Frogger,

71
00:03:23,647 --> 00:03:25,008
you know, Stick Hero, borrowing from

72
00:03:25,449 --> 00:03:26,930
any numerous arcade games.

73
00:03:27,811 --> 00:03:34,598
and simplify them down to a core, made them really, really tight and easy, and rolled them out.

74
00:03:34,638 --> 00:03:37,000
And you can see the numbers here. I mean, these are ridiculous.

75
00:03:38,381 --> 00:03:42,926
Even more ridiculous is a lot of these numbers came by and large organically.

76
00:03:43,546 --> 00:03:48,551
People, you know, kids talking on the schoolyard and sharing the game at school with their friends.

77
00:03:48,571 --> 00:03:51,074
You know, a game could easily...

78
00:03:51,574 --> 00:03:54,675
get to the top of the charts and that just would amplify the download numbers.

79
00:03:55,155 --> 00:03:59,497
So you really got this crazy, this way of achieving crazy huge downloads.

80
00:04:00,517 --> 00:04:02,878
Right? So it seems kind of easy on the surface, right?

81
00:04:02,918 --> 00:04:07,139
Make a simple game, get crazy huge downloads, profit, and buy an island.

82
00:04:10,630 --> 00:04:21,815
Super casual gameplay, you know, to really break it down is really the same thing we've been seeing even in coin-op games from the 70s and 80s.

83
00:04:22,215 --> 00:04:30,018
You put in a quarter, very simple, friendly graphics, you understand by looking at it what's going on, you jump in, no tutorials or fatuis.

84
00:04:31,058 --> 00:04:33,679
I always want to do that every time I say that word.

85
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:40,943
You just jump in, quick to start, really, really easy to get hooked.

86
00:04:41,503 --> 00:04:44,805
And usually if you like it, you play again.

87
00:04:44,965 --> 00:04:46,606
You want to get a little better at your score.

88
00:04:47,066 --> 00:04:51,829
And there's usually this very typical thing in game design where you ramp a challenge,

89
00:04:51,869 --> 00:04:51,969
right?

90
00:04:51,989 --> 00:04:53,429
You want things to get more and more challenging.

91
00:04:53,469 --> 00:04:53,770
You want...

92
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:58,174
that pain, you want to achieve that, you want the pleasure of doing that.

93
00:04:58,694 --> 00:05:02,057
And that's how these games work. Very simple stuff we all know as game designers,

94
00:05:02,198 --> 00:05:06,021
programmers, anyone who's ever played a game with any depth.

95
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:09,965
Nothing kind of new here. So

96
00:05:10,345 --> 00:05:13,208
the company that best exemplified this super casual era

97
00:05:13,288 --> 00:05:13,909
from 2015 to 2016 was Ketchap.

98
00:05:16,194 --> 00:05:18,897
So Ketchap were two brothers out in France.

99
00:05:19,537 --> 00:05:23,161
They created a few of these games very simply,

100
00:05:23,261 --> 00:05:23,821
masterfully.

101
00:05:24,322 --> 00:05:27,745
They cloned a lot of existing games that were actually

102
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:30,267
premium games and made them free and achieved success

103
00:05:30,307 --> 00:05:30,628
that way.

104
00:05:31,068 --> 00:05:35,452
They published a number of indies that created games and

105
00:05:35,472 --> 00:05:35,973
put them out there.

106
00:05:36,393 --> 00:05:38,935
And they got just a crazy amount of downloads overall

107
00:05:40,157 --> 00:05:41,298
and ended up.

108
00:05:42,339 --> 00:05:48,059
Netting millions of dollars per year ended up selling actually to I think Goldman Sachs recently

109
00:05:51,604 --> 00:05:55,047
Another very interesting story in this era is this game,

110
00:05:55,087 --> 00:05:55,667
Color Switch.

111
00:05:56,147 --> 00:05:59,150
Color Switch was actually built by a veteran who didn't

112
00:05:59,170 --> 00:05:59,810
know how to program.

113
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:01,851
He picked up a tool called Build Box.

114
00:06:01,891 --> 00:06:04,653
He just had this idea for a game that the ball changes

115
00:06:04,693 --> 00:06:06,655
color and can only go through moving objects

116
00:06:06,695 --> 00:06:07,355
of the same color.

117
00:06:07,636 --> 00:06:11,218
Again, it's a mechanic we've seen before in various ways.

118
00:06:11,899 --> 00:06:14,460
He just did it masterfully, really put love into the

119
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:16,822
levels, and it became a huge success.

120
00:06:17,162 --> 00:06:19,504
Millions of downloads and did quite well with that.

121
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:23,961
So then something changed in 2017,

122
00:06:24,301 --> 00:06:26,042
amid all this other stuff going on,

123
00:06:26,102 --> 00:06:28,343
which was video ads, rewarded video ads.

124
00:06:28,843 --> 00:06:31,925
So, of course, rewarded video ads are always with us.

125
00:06:32,245 --> 00:06:33,606
They've always been out there.

126
00:06:34,146 --> 00:06:36,627
But ads at this point became,

127
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:40,289
the networks became much more mature.

128
00:06:40,729 --> 00:06:43,631
So it was actually very cheap on places like Facebook

129
00:06:43,671 --> 00:06:46,912
or AppLovin to buy these ads.

130
00:06:47,913 --> 00:06:50,094
put a little clip of your game pay out there,

131
00:06:50,754 --> 00:06:52,935
and people, especially young people and kids,

132
00:06:53,275 --> 00:06:54,755
would really click on them

133
00:06:54,775 --> 00:06:55,976
and always want to try the latest thing, right?

134
00:06:55,996 --> 00:06:56,596
It was just easy.

135
00:06:56,796 --> 00:06:58,977
Click on the ad, try it, and move on.

136
00:07:01,077 --> 00:07:02,918
And the other thing that was happening

137
00:07:03,138 --> 00:07:04,839
is because so many people were using these ads,

138
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:06,379
the CPMs, the money you would get

139
00:07:06,439 --> 00:07:07,620
by putting these ads in your game,

140
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:09,680
became quite high as well.

141
00:07:10,281 --> 00:07:15,866
So, it didn't take rocket science, but it did take some insight to realize that you

142
00:07:15,886 --> 00:07:17,447
could arbitrage the system pretty well.

143
00:07:17,827 --> 00:07:24,793
If you could figure out a way to show more ads to players than you would spend to inquire

144
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:26,755
the players, you could do quite well.

145
00:07:28,476 --> 00:07:32,399
And indeed, many companies took advantage of this arbitrage.

146
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:35,982
Nobody more than the monster we call Voodoo.

147
00:07:37,504 --> 00:07:41,607
Voodoo were indie game players that had a few small hits

148
00:07:41,667 --> 00:07:42,088
of their own.

149
00:07:42,728 --> 00:07:45,851
They came out with a game, Paper.io, a very hyper casual

150
00:07:47,572 --> 00:07:48,753
quote unquote multiplayer game.

151
00:07:48,813 --> 00:07:50,835
Wasn't really multiplayer, but it felt like it was.

152
00:07:51,676 --> 00:07:56,838
And within years they had I think 40 games the first year,

153
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:59,039
maybe a few hundred games the second year.

154
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,061
And they achieved just in 2018 over a billion downloads.

155
00:08:08,284 --> 00:08:09,764
So how did Voodoo do this?

156
00:08:10,245 --> 00:08:13,126
They actually got even more mindless than Flappy Bird.

157
00:08:14,647 --> 00:08:16,328
And again, I say this with great respect.

158
00:08:17,425 --> 00:08:20,709
They took this super casual model of being easy to grok,

159
00:08:21,090 --> 00:08:23,853
quick to master, and the quick sessions, right?

160
00:08:24,013 --> 00:08:24,093
And.

161
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:30,482
What they did that's really, really counterintuitive to anyone who's studied game design or anybody

162
00:08:30,942 --> 00:08:35,623
that's really gotten to the essence of what makes a game, they took away the challenge,

163
00:08:35,923 --> 00:08:37,043
really, in a lot of cases.

164
00:08:37,123 --> 00:08:38,564
They actually made the game rewarding.

165
00:08:38,924 --> 00:08:41,724
You play the game and you do better and better and better and better.

166
00:08:42,945 --> 00:08:43,985
Do you get bored quickly?

167
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:45,885
Eventually you do.

168
00:08:46,105 --> 00:08:47,026
The retention's pretty low.

169
00:08:47,986 --> 00:08:50,586
But you really have fun for a few days while you're at it.

170
00:08:51,722 --> 00:08:53,923
So one could ask, you know, philosophically,

171
00:08:54,304 --> 00:08:55,425
are these real games?

172
00:08:55,505 --> 00:08:58,848
Is this really just a linear experience

173
00:08:58,888 --> 00:09:00,149
disguised as interactivity?

174
00:09:00,229 --> 00:09:02,851
And I have strong opinions on the subject,

175
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,552
but we won't go down that path for now.

176
00:09:05,573 --> 00:09:08,796
But the point is they worked, and they worked really well.

177
00:09:09,376 --> 00:09:11,939
Not just Voodoo, but many other companies, indies.

178
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,585
Folks, 2018 was the year of the hyper casual game

179
00:09:17,065 --> 00:09:18,107
and it continues to this day,

180
00:09:18,147 --> 00:09:21,591
which I think if you look at the download stats right now,

181
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:25,677
55%, maybe even close to 60% of the games out there

182
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:28,441
in terms of downloads are hyper casual games.

183
00:09:30,925 --> 00:09:36,812
Right, so what we saw, if you want to break this little casual game market into epochs,

184
00:09:37,233 --> 00:09:43,580
you have your era from 2007 to 2012 of the premium casual epoch, casual free to play

185
00:09:43,640 --> 00:09:49,727
from 2013 to 2016, the super casual creeped in there from 16 to 17, and then we're now

186
00:09:49,787 --> 00:09:51,629
in the era of the hyper casual game.

187
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:59,275
Now of course, that's not to say there aren't many other genres, blah blah blah, but if we're talking about casual, this is really where the business has gone.

188
00:09:59,856 --> 00:10:01,977
So monetization goes way down.

189
00:10:02,758 --> 00:10:05,000
Premium casual, you'd actually spend a little money to buy a game.

190
00:10:05,420 --> 00:10:08,142
Hyper casual, there's often no in-app purchases at all.

191
00:10:08,282 --> 00:10:11,405
You're just playing and you're being monetized by ads.

192
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:15,988
Retention, as we discussed also, has plummeted.

193
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,373
But obviously, there's something that's driving this,

194
00:10:20,413 --> 00:10:21,114
and it's downloads.

195
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:24,135
It's just the sheer ease and ability to get massive,

196
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:25,235
massive amounts of downloads.

197
00:10:25,555 --> 00:10:27,096
And that volume drives profit.

198
00:10:28,697 --> 00:10:29,897
So let's talk about profit.

199
00:10:31,258 --> 00:10:34,599
And how many of you all consider yourself business

200
00:10:34,679 --> 00:10:34,899
folks?

201
00:10:36,897 --> 00:10:39,181
Cool, that's about a quarter.

202
00:10:40,242 --> 00:10:45,590
And so who considers themselves a hardcore indie

203
00:10:45,911 --> 00:10:48,475
gamer, or game maker, game developer?

204
00:10:50,140 --> 00:10:51,400
Okay, also a small amount.

205
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:55,781
So, you know, a lot of times you won't think about the math

206
00:10:56,181 --> 00:10:58,602
if you're making a game, you think about the fun, right?

207
00:10:58,622 --> 00:11:00,082
But you really have to understand the math

208
00:11:00,122 --> 00:11:01,482
of how this works and how this breaks down,

209
00:11:01,502 --> 00:11:03,183
because it's going to drive your every decision

210
00:11:03,643 --> 00:11:05,123
in terms of how long you spend on the game,

211
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:06,684
how polished the game is,

212
00:11:07,064 --> 00:11:09,944
and of course what the final game is

213
00:11:10,104 --> 00:11:10,905
and how you distribute it.

214
00:11:12,428 --> 00:11:15,270
So if you want to break it down in one chart,

215
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:17,831
it's not rocket science.

216
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:19,912
The way you make money in the free-to-play business

217
00:11:20,632 --> 00:11:23,153
is you bring in more revenue per customer

218
00:11:23,454 --> 00:11:24,774
than you spend acquiring them.

219
00:11:26,015 --> 00:11:28,956
And hyper-casual, these numbers are low.

220
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,877
Casino, these numbers are incredibly high.

221
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:36,139
You'll actually maybe spend $100 to bring in a real money

222
00:11:36,359 --> 00:11:40,461
casino player, but they'll earn you much more than that

223
00:11:40,641 --> 00:11:41,082
once they stay.

224
00:11:43,934 --> 00:11:46,895
So let's look very quickly at a profit and loss sheet

225
00:11:46,955 --> 00:11:48,495
for a successful hyper-casual game.

226
00:11:49,695 --> 00:11:53,576
So on the expense side, not including the development cost,

227
00:11:53,656 --> 00:11:56,437
which essentially washes out once you have a profitable

228
00:11:56,457 --> 00:12:00,218
game, on the expense side, you have ads.

229
00:12:00,438 --> 00:12:03,339
You have to spend money on ads to acquire your players.

230
00:12:03,879 --> 00:12:05,659
Now, you might get some cross-promotion with the

231
00:12:05,699 --> 00:12:08,580
publisher, you might get featured, but you shouldn't

232
00:12:08,620 --> 00:12:08,980
count on it.

233
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:11,261
You should count on ads as the thing you can predict if

234
00:12:11,281 --> 00:12:12,441
you're putting together a business plan.

235
00:12:13,695 --> 00:12:18,480
So a good hypercasual game will have an ad cost of about 40 cents an ad.

236
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:22,703
So that's the target we have to beat. If we can make more than 40 cents, we have a profitable game.

237
00:12:23,564 --> 00:12:32,312
So how do we figure that out? The beautiful thing about hypercasual games and about the crappy retention in hypercasual games is

238
00:12:32,753 --> 00:12:35,175
you could know very quickly by looking at the day one retention

239
00:12:36,284 --> 00:12:38,005
how much money your game's going to make.

240
00:12:38,085 --> 00:12:40,306
It's actually a proxy for the entire revenue of your game.

241
00:12:40,986 --> 00:12:42,487
And let me explain why, right?

242
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:47,170
Like, that chart on the right is a typical retention chart

243
00:12:47,210 --> 00:12:49,012
where 100% of people play on day one.

244
00:12:49,312 --> 00:12:53,034
After day two, maybe 60% of people are not interested,

245
00:12:53,094 --> 00:12:54,455
not going to come back.

246
00:12:54,795 --> 00:12:55,115
40% might be.

247
00:12:55,836 --> 00:12:57,517
And day three, that drops even more.

248
00:12:57,637 --> 00:13:00,719
And that curve is very steep for hyper-casual games

249
00:13:00,779 --> 00:13:02,740
because, as we mentioned, they kind of get boring after a

250
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:03,981
while when you move on to the new one.

251
00:13:05,765 --> 00:13:07,727
But if you can get your retention to about 50%,

252
00:13:08,308 --> 00:13:12,012
that typically, typically kind of breaks out

253
00:13:12,052 --> 00:13:15,055
to about a five day lifespan on average for players.

254
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:20,410
And most games, again, this varies wildly,

255
00:13:20,491 --> 00:13:23,072
but most games will get about three sessions a day

256
00:13:24,013 --> 00:13:25,714
of people actually coming back and playing.

257
00:13:26,295 --> 00:13:28,496
Maybe you'll show three video ads per session.

258
00:13:29,137 --> 00:13:31,398
And let's say you can make a penny per video ad,

259
00:13:31,438 --> 00:13:33,380
which is reasonable, a bit on the high end.

260
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,962
So if you take five times three times three,

261
00:13:35,982 --> 00:13:37,723
you get 45 times a penny.

262
00:13:38,203 --> 00:13:40,625
So now we have 45 cents we've made from each player.

263
00:13:41,506 --> 00:13:42,667
Boom, we have a profitable game.

264
00:13:44,048 --> 00:13:44,368
Make sense?

265
00:13:46,585 --> 00:13:52,937
So if we zoom in on hypercasual from you as a studio's point of view or from a publisher's

266
00:13:52,957 --> 00:13:57,526
point of view, our goal is to be above this line, right, and profit.

267
00:13:58,664 --> 00:14:01,525
So if you take any hundred hypercasual games that,

268
00:14:01,685 --> 00:14:03,606
there's probably everyone in this audience

269
00:14:03,746 --> 00:14:05,027
that say makes a hypercasual game,

270
00:14:05,047 --> 00:14:07,628
we have a game jam and everyone makes a decent game.

271
00:14:08,028 --> 00:14:09,689
So I'm not even talking about the really bad ones,

272
00:14:09,709 --> 00:14:11,909
just everyone makes a decent game that's somewhat fun

273
00:14:11,969 --> 00:14:13,750
and fun to pass around to friends.

274
00:14:14,691 --> 00:14:17,011
It's really, really, really difficult to know

275
00:14:17,232 --> 00:14:18,772
looking at it, if it's gonna succeed or fail.

276
00:14:20,255 --> 00:14:26,120
But what we have, and what's wonderful about hypercasual games, and some would say horrible about hypercasual games, is market testing.

277
00:14:26,941 --> 00:14:34,688
So you take a hundred games and actually put it out there, and after a day or two, you can actually see what your day one retention is and plot that.

278
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:39,392
A lot of your games are going to be zero retention, right? There's just no one's going to come back.

279
00:14:39,873 --> 00:14:45,498
You might have a few outliers on the top that people actually love, and they're coming back for weeks and weeks or even months and months.

280
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:50,191
Then do the same thing with video ads for those games.

281
00:14:50,832 --> 00:14:53,734
Make a test video ad for the game, do your best shot, put

282
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:54,194
it out there.

283
00:14:54,535 --> 00:14:59,578
And remarkably, the cost for these video ads varies a lot

284
00:15:00,039 --> 00:15:02,660
and actually remains consistent oftentimes, even

285
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,502
though you could do slight optimizations.

286
00:15:05,282 --> 00:15:11,867
the video ad actually remains, whatever cost you see for the video ad if you test it for a few days,

287
00:15:12,387 --> 00:15:16,910
actually ends up being the video ad cost that you would run for up to a million players.

288
00:15:21,034 --> 00:15:23,215
Again, you'll see very cheap video costs for most of them.

289
00:15:23,636 --> 00:15:26,098
Some of them you might see really expensive CPI costs

290
00:15:26,118 --> 00:15:29,221
because maybe the video art just doesn't appeal to people

291
00:15:29,241 --> 00:15:31,463
for whatever inexplicable reason.

292
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:34,746
Maybe the game looks too similar to something else

293
00:15:34,786 --> 00:15:36,367
that's already just, they've just played.

294
00:15:37,428 --> 00:15:38,589
And you just don't know until you try it.

295
00:15:38,649 --> 00:15:39,630
So you put it out there, try it.

296
00:15:40,811 --> 00:15:41,932
Now you take these hundred games

297
00:15:41,992 --> 00:15:43,774
and you plot the cost per install.

298
00:15:44,822 --> 00:15:48,623
based on the video ad and the lifetime customer value based on the retention.

299
00:15:49,344 --> 00:15:53,485
And as you can see, you'll have a couple little dots that eke above the profit line.

300
00:15:55,426 --> 00:15:58,288
And this is unfortunately what the picture really looks like.

301
00:16:00,809 --> 00:16:01,009
But

302
00:16:01,967 --> 00:16:08,029
If you can take the ones that are near the line and put in some tricks that improve retention,

303
00:16:08,089 --> 00:16:15,232
like coming back and getting bonuses or achievements that give you a reason to come back and better

304
00:16:15,252 --> 00:16:20,095
push notifications and all the typical bag of tricks that increase retention.

305
00:16:22,716 --> 00:16:27,198
And of course, if you can smartly show more ads to players, you've now increased your

306
00:16:27,238 --> 00:16:30,319
lifetime customer value and now you have more hits that have creeped above the line.

307
00:16:34,222 --> 00:16:39,907
Then finally, on the publisher side, the publisher uses the vast amount of data they have, plus

308
00:16:39,927 --> 00:16:44,792
their network to cross-promote between all their games, to drive down the cost per install.

309
00:16:45,672 --> 00:16:49,175
Now by driving down the cost per install, you've even lifted more of those dots above

310
00:16:49,196 --> 00:16:49,476
the line.

311
00:16:50,296 --> 00:16:55,181
So most of them, just to be a million percent clear, will fail.

312
00:16:56,562 --> 00:17:00,526
But the few that rise above the line, you now have a system, a provable system to pump

313
00:17:00,546 --> 00:17:00,586
it.

314
00:17:01,863 --> 00:17:05,305
marketing money into it and profit very, very handsomely.

315
00:17:08,426 --> 00:17:11,568
So, I mean, I almost view hyper-casual games as the,

316
00:17:13,850 --> 00:17:18,034
is the crowdsourcing way of proving hits, right?

317
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:20,416
And it kind of works with the thing

318
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:21,757
we all know deep in our gut,

319
00:17:22,198 --> 00:17:23,919
is that none of us know what we're doing

320
00:17:24,260 --> 00:17:25,241
when it comes to making games.

321
00:17:25,901 --> 00:17:30,526
And this model lets you take some tries,

322
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:32,207
take some shots, and prove right away

323
00:17:32,227 --> 00:17:34,650
if you have something that can be a good business or not.

324
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,897
So where this is all going, and I think it's pretty clear, and it's been this way for a while,

325
00:17:43,838 --> 00:17:46,441
certainly was in the social game business and now it is in the mobile game business,

326
00:17:46,461 --> 00:17:51,287
we're basically replicating what we're seeing in pop music and in pop in general.

327
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:58,035
Right, so if you're a new studio coming out and you want to create a game, you can either

328
00:17:58,796 --> 00:18:05,583
put a lot of money into it and use months and months and months, if not years of development

329
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:12,469
cost, a huge team, maybe get a big license, do a soft launch for many months and tweak

330
00:18:13,030 --> 00:18:14,011
your metrics until you've...

331
00:18:15,112 --> 00:18:17,654
you've got it working, and then spend tons of money

332
00:18:17,694 --> 00:18:20,756
on marketing, and plus use your relationships

333
00:18:20,776 --> 00:18:22,997
to get Apple and Google featuring, and do quite well.

334
00:18:23,358 --> 00:18:26,900
And that of course works, but if it doesn't work,

335
00:18:26,940 --> 00:18:29,322
it's a very big risk for many companies.

336
00:18:30,483 --> 00:18:31,784
Or you could be the nimble dwarf, right?

337
00:18:31,824 --> 00:18:33,825
Just make a playable game,

338
00:18:34,325 --> 00:18:35,766
kind of a step or two above a prototype,

339
00:18:36,207 --> 00:18:37,748
lure players in with the cheap video ads

340
00:18:37,788 --> 00:18:38,488
to see if they like it,

341
00:18:38,969 --> 00:18:40,530
and see if they retain long enough to profit.

342
00:18:45,354 --> 00:18:50,307
Yeah, so is this easy money? Is this a whale farting a rainbow out of its blowhole?

343
00:18:53,628 --> 00:18:55,349
It's really not, as I think, you know,

344
00:18:55,389 --> 00:18:57,371
if that chart wasn't clear to you

345
00:18:57,771 --> 00:18:59,352
and was maybe, didn't illustrate enough,

346
00:18:59,392 --> 00:19:00,333
hopefully this picture will.

347
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,455
You know, if you partner with a publisher,

348
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:07,278
what publishers do is this essentially this crowdsourcing.

349
00:19:07,719 --> 00:19:11,241
They will take your game as part of a swarm military tactic,

350
00:19:11,682 --> 00:19:13,003
which is a valid military tactic,

351
00:19:13,543 --> 00:19:15,685
and swarm the machine gun nest,

352
00:19:16,445 --> 00:19:17,586
and most of you will die.

353
00:19:18,707 --> 00:19:20,408
In fact, here, this was the reason I want the ball back.

354
00:19:23,236 --> 00:19:23,876
Let me say that again.

355
00:19:24,456 --> 00:19:25,256
Most of you will die.

356
00:19:25,276 --> 00:19:27,817
Thank you.

357
00:19:33,119 --> 00:19:36,439
But the ones that succeed, for very little effort, very

358
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:39,420
little time put into the game, can do incredibly well.

359
00:19:39,620 --> 00:19:41,041
And the numbers prove that out.

360
00:19:41,081 --> 00:19:43,461
Even though it's a few cents per user, because of the

361
00:19:43,561 --> 00:19:46,182
multi-million downloads, that amounts to a great business.

362
00:19:47,851 --> 00:19:50,893
Now, whether you go at it alone or use a publisher is, of course, up to you.

363
00:19:51,994 --> 00:19:52,734
Every deal's different.

364
00:19:52,754 --> 00:19:54,435
You have to shop around.

365
00:19:55,536 --> 00:20:01,280
Publishers do have some great benefits for a pop system like this, just like a big music

366
00:20:01,981 --> 00:20:05,463
label has a big benefit to an aspiring songwriter.

367
00:20:07,124 --> 00:20:08,465
They've done a lot of deals with UA.

368
00:20:08,485 --> 00:20:10,787
They know how to optimize the price and get the cheapest ads.

369
00:20:11,555 --> 00:20:16,218
They've seen a lot about what works and doesn't work and can provide some really good advice.

370
00:20:17,019 --> 00:20:22,762
And of course they'll have other games oftentimes that they can promote your game in and get

371
00:20:22,782 --> 00:20:23,943
you a lot of free traffic.

372
00:20:26,263 --> 00:20:34,285
So as far as which publisher to go to, Voodoo is still quite dominant, with almost 30% of

373
00:20:34,305 --> 00:20:36,346
the downloads single-handedly as a company.

374
00:20:37,126 --> 00:20:44,728
There's a new attempted king of the jungle there starting in August with Lion Studios,

375
00:20:44,868 --> 00:20:47,429
an offshoot from the ad company Applovin.

376
00:20:48,629 --> 00:20:49,870
And there's some other players out there.

377
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:52,612
And in the green band, that's just other publishers.

378
00:20:52,632 --> 00:20:54,934
And there's a lot of smaller up-and-coming publishers.

379
00:20:55,454 --> 00:20:59,657
And I predict a few of them will get up there

380
00:20:59,797 --> 00:21:02,179
in this big echelon of downloads in 2019.

381
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,381
Here's a list of a bunch of them.

382
00:21:06,682 --> 00:21:07,722
And by the way, at the end,

383
00:21:07,742 --> 00:21:09,063
I'm gonna post the link to the slides.

384
00:21:09,083 --> 00:21:12,606
So don't worry about all the math and logos.

385
00:21:12,926 --> 00:21:13,967
This will all be available online.

386
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:21,250
And, you know, like I was saying, this really is resembling now to me, if you pull back,

387
00:21:21,590 --> 00:21:22,571
the pop music industry.

388
00:21:22,931 --> 00:21:27,613
You have tons and tons of eager hopefuls, many with quite a bit of talent.

389
00:21:29,074 --> 00:21:33,256
You have a product that's aiming for mass appeal.

390
00:21:35,064 --> 00:21:39,447
You are putting craft and speed over your artistry when you're actually building that product.

391
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:42,448
You're trying to do something that's trendy, not innovative.

392
00:21:43,549 --> 00:21:46,991
You often are using repetitive beats and rhythms, or in our case, repetitive taps.

393
00:21:48,692 --> 00:21:53,374
And, you know, ultimately, there's a marketing and promo machine that proves out the winners.

394
00:21:53,995 --> 00:21:56,776
And, you know, of course, there is some risk. Sometimes it fails.

395
00:21:56,836 --> 00:22:00,678
But almost always, if the machine tells you you're going to have a hit on your hands, you do.

396
00:22:01,159 --> 00:22:01,919
And it makes sure you do.

397
00:22:04,710 --> 00:22:07,995
And there was a great NPR piece on Planet Money

398
00:22:08,476 --> 00:22:10,299
about how the pop music business works.

399
00:22:11,120 --> 00:22:13,124
And it's pretty fascinating.

400
00:22:14,246 --> 00:22:16,089
Once you're vetted as a talented songwriter,

401
00:22:18,523 --> 00:22:19,244
by good producers.

402
00:22:19,664 --> 00:22:21,525
They'll have you come in and write a few songs.

403
00:22:22,606 --> 00:22:24,287
Of course, throw most of them away.

404
00:22:24,347 --> 00:22:26,989
But the ones that work, they might get a better producer

405
00:22:27,029 --> 00:22:29,011
to really lay down a track and do a vocal booster.

406
00:22:29,091 --> 00:22:32,893
And finally, they might get some people to come in and

407
00:22:32,953 --> 00:22:34,174
focus test it and hear it.

408
00:22:34,495 --> 00:22:36,656
They might mix it and master it.

409
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:37,857
All that's pretty cheap.

410
00:22:37,997 --> 00:22:39,158
That's about maybe $70,000, $80,000.

411
00:22:42,231 --> 00:22:47,154
And then, once it's at that point,

412
00:22:47,495 --> 00:22:48,896
they'll play it in some test markets,

413
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:51,457
make sure their thesis works in terms of marketing,

414
00:22:51,798 --> 00:22:53,419
and then spend the big money and jam it

415
00:22:53,799 --> 00:22:58,042
into everybody's ear hole, whether you want to hear it

416
00:22:58,062 --> 00:22:59,363
or not, you're gonna hear the pop song.

417
00:22:59,983 --> 00:23:01,504
And it obviously works, right?

418
00:23:02,004 --> 00:23:02,985
It's become a big business,

419
00:23:04,086 --> 00:23:06,888
and it's about doing the marketing at the tail end.

420
00:23:09,180 --> 00:23:13,001
So I think the question you have to ask yourself as a game maker is, are you Esther Dean?

421
00:23:14,162 --> 00:23:19,163
And for those who don't know Esther Dean, she's a face behind many of the hit songs

422
00:23:20,243 --> 00:23:25,645
that we listen to, and in my case, forced to listen to, all the time.

423
00:23:26,905 --> 00:23:31,026
She's written many, many hits for people like Rihanna, Katy Perry, Nic Minaj, Beyoncé, Drake, Usher,

424
00:23:31,066 --> 00:23:34,967
I could go on and on and on. Songs like Firework and etc.

425
00:23:36,392 --> 00:23:38,553
And her process is pretty amazing.

426
00:23:38,593 --> 00:23:41,294
If you have a chance to see her on YouTube and just see her process,

427
00:23:41,894 --> 00:23:45,535
she's got a good voice, but really what she's got is this

428
00:23:46,095 --> 00:23:49,497
this uncanny sense of of finding a hook, right?

429
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:52,058
Finding this part of a song that people can't get out of their head.

430
00:23:52,698 --> 00:23:53,879
And this is her process.

431
00:23:53,899 --> 00:23:56,661
She just goes in there and screams and yells and chants

432
00:23:56,721 --> 00:23:58,783
in strange gutturals.

433
00:23:59,583 --> 00:24:02,325
And when she feels that chill, she knows she's hit it.

434
00:24:02,726 --> 00:24:03,826
Everyone in the room knows she's hit it.

435
00:24:04,487 --> 00:24:07,349
And boom, they start printing the money.

436
00:24:10,552 --> 00:24:13,794
So it's pretty crazy.

437
00:24:13,834 --> 00:24:17,157
But if you feel you have that Esther Dean talent equivalent

438
00:24:17,237 --> 00:24:19,799
in game mechanic design, go for it.

439
00:24:20,319 --> 00:24:21,000
And you will do well.

440
00:24:23,849 --> 00:24:27,270
So I want to leave you with a few just big weighty thoughts

441
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,872
about what this all means in terms of the games business.

442
00:24:31,932 --> 00:24:35,833
Because again, some of it from a data science level

443
00:24:35,933 --> 00:24:37,354
and a business level is fascinating.

444
00:24:37,814 --> 00:24:40,015
From a creative game making level,

445
00:24:40,115 --> 00:24:42,336
it's a bit disturbing and unsettling.

446
00:24:45,017 --> 00:24:47,978
So this is my first prediction.

447
00:24:49,338 --> 00:24:53,763
You know, right now, if you're into the world of ad networks,

448
00:24:54,384 --> 00:24:56,146
there is a lot of what they call AI.

449
00:24:56,166 --> 00:24:58,930
It's really just A-B testing done through algorithm

450
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:01,112
happening in ad networks.

451
00:25:01,172 --> 00:25:01,653
In other words,

452
00:25:02,534 --> 00:25:03,955
You'll see one ad with a blue button,

453
00:25:04,035 --> 00:25:04,956
one ad with a yellow button.

454
00:25:05,317 --> 00:25:06,678
They'll see which one gets more clicks,

455
00:25:06,698 --> 00:25:07,719
and then they'll show more of that one.

456
00:25:07,739 --> 00:25:10,061
And then they'll show one with this little tagline.

457
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,183
They'll show one with this little tagline.

458
00:25:12,203 --> 00:25:13,103
Whichever one gets more clicks,

459
00:25:13,163 --> 00:25:15,906
they'll give more dominance to.

460
00:25:16,466 --> 00:25:17,387
And it works, right?

461
00:25:17,407 --> 00:25:20,149
You end up getting ads that drive more clicks.

462
00:25:20,410 --> 00:25:22,491
And the market, you're crowdsourcing your problem,

463
00:25:22,511 --> 00:25:24,733
and the market is proving out which ad works the best

464
00:25:24,793 --> 00:25:25,714
and which ad they like the most.

465
00:25:26,695 --> 00:25:28,036
This is used not just in the game industry.

466
00:25:28,076 --> 00:25:29,678
This is used in all advertising.

467
00:25:31,639 --> 00:25:37,241
Games, I believe someone, and I think it's a problem people are working on now as we speak,

468
00:25:38,001 --> 00:25:41,482
people are creating systems that will design their own game mechanics.

469
00:25:42,362 --> 00:25:49,464
And again, as a game designer, it's a little bit scary, but these systems will blend the mechanics

470
00:25:49,784 --> 00:25:55,065
and colors and art and shapes and music from all these other hit games.

471
00:25:56,066 --> 00:25:58,588
create some truly horrible hybrid monsters,

472
00:25:59,288 --> 00:26:01,190
but somewhere in there, they'll also create,

473
00:26:01,670 --> 00:26:06,875
I believe, a hit that makes Flappy Bird look like,

474
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,237
what's a good bird metaphor?

475
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:10,978
I don't know.

476
00:26:11,058 --> 00:26:13,100
It'll make Flappy Bird look like a flop, right?

477
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:18,144
So it's scary, but talk to me in a year.

478
00:26:18,164 --> 00:26:18,884
We'll see if this happens.

479
00:26:21,907 --> 00:26:22,808
Big prediction number two.

480
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:28,762
And this is like maybe a ray of hope, but you know,

481
00:26:29,042 --> 00:26:31,284
this is not going to necessarily last quite the way it is.

482
00:26:31,324 --> 00:26:31,904
It never does.

483
00:26:32,044 --> 00:26:33,926
None of these trends and markets do.

484
00:26:34,806 --> 00:26:35,867
Everything's getting crowded.

485
00:26:36,007 --> 00:26:39,930
There's too many people trying to go after the same prize.

486
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:42,732
Too many publishers making too many games

487
00:26:43,052 --> 00:26:44,753
that are too much the same.

488
00:26:45,914 --> 00:26:47,435
Too many of these ads look the same.

489
00:26:47,835 --> 00:26:50,657
So audiences are getting bored with the same old, same old.

490
00:26:51,438 --> 00:26:54,120
Publishers will hit a revenue ceiling no matter how many

491
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:59,623
You know aspiring studios and indies they work with to create that swarm effect

492
00:26:59,643 --> 00:27:03,186
they'll just get a hit a ceiling of how many hits they're gonna be able to get and

493
00:27:04,066 --> 00:27:07,609
Guess what everyone will discover this magical thing called engagement with

494
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:15,911
good old-fashioned social features and narrative and deep play systems and multiplayer systems and

495
00:27:16,251 --> 00:27:20,532
saga maps and actually difficulty and level design and deep economies and blah blah blah.

496
00:27:21,212 --> 00:27:26,133
All the stuff that we've been doing in mobile and probably before.

497
00:27:28,954 --> 00:27:35,215
So that's pretty much it. That's the flap and hopefully giving you some food for thought.

498
00:27:35,355 --> 00:27:35,835
Thank you so much.
