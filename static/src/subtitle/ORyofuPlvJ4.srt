00:00:12,452 --> 00:00:16,096
Hi and hello to the people in chat. This is very cool. It's like

2
00:00:16,969 --> 00:00:21,311
dual purpose presentation and very, very hyped for this.

3
00:00:22,051 --> 00:00:25,713
And I am also, good segue, very hyped to talk about

4
00:00:26,033 --> 00:00:27,834
Among Us' TikTok strategy with you,

5
00:00:28,214 --> 00:00:30,075
which I have seen some people go like,

6
00:00:30,095 --> 00:00:32,656
TikTok is my nemesis, and I understand,

7
00:00:32,676 --> 00:00:34,917
and I understand there's a lot of social media platforms

8
00:00:34,997 --> 00:00:37,298
out there, so this is going to be a deep dive

9
00:00:37,338 --> 00:00:39,099
into one of them to hopefully kind of

10
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:40,740
help you navigate everything.

11
00:00:41,614 --> 00:00:44,798
So as a brief introduction, my name is Victoria Tran.

12
00:00:45,218 --> 00:00:48,162
I'm the community director at Innersloth.

13
00:00:48,682 --> 00:00:51,266
We make the game Among Us and the Henry Stickmin Collection.

14
00:00:51,506 --> 00:00:53,248
And at any point and afterwards, you

15
00:00:53,288 --> 00:00:57,594
can find me on Twitter at the VTran, usually around there,

16
00:00:57,714 --> 00:00:59,276
as many of us really are.

17
00:01:00,447 --> 00:01:04,931
And before I kind of get into like the in-depth portion

18
00:01:05,332 --> 00:01:07,995
of Among Us' TikTok, I do have a confession

19
00:01:08,715 --> 00:01:11,598
that at this point I'm like a serial instigator,

20
00:01:11,718 --> 00:01:15,162
creator, content maker for Indie Game Studio TikToks.

21
00:01:16,203 --> 00:01:18,365
Among Us is not the only one that I've worked on

22
00:01:18,505 --> 00:01:20,227
and I think that actually gives me a lot

23
00:01:20,367 --> 00:01:22,369
of really nice context and contextual.

24
00:01:22,999 --> 00:01:30,255
context and info when it comes to other kind of game studios and other genres. So as a really brief

25
00:01:31,082 --> 00:01:36,804
overview of what I've done. I initially started the Kitfox Games TikTok account in February 2020

26
00:01:37,144 --> 00:01:43,287
and they did amazing. I did not get them to 25k followers like you see here. I think I got them

27
00:01:43,327 --> 00:01:49,149
to like 10k and they've done an amazing job with it and they obviously had a bunch of different

28
00:01:49,189 --> 00:01:54,051
games and also was interesting in that it was a studio account and not just a singular game.

29
00:01:54,812 --> 00:01:59,518
And then in July 2021, I worked on the unpacking TikTok account,

30
00:01:59,858 --> 00:02:02,021
which by the way, they're doing amazing.

31
00:02:02,061 --> 00:02:03,623
They're like up for awards.

32
00:02:03,663 --> 00:02:04,444
I'm very proud of them.

33
00:02:05,165 --> 00:02:08,489
And that did super well that I think got to 170k

34
00:02:08,549 --> 00:02:09,930
until I left in December 2021,

35
00:02:11,292 --> 00:02:13,935
because that was just a side thing that I was helping them out with.

36
00:02:14,710 --> 00:02:18,232
And then finally, we reached the Among Us TikTok account, which is my main thing,

37
00:02:18,332 --> 00:02:23,636
and I started that in December 2020. So, yeah. So, I've worked on a bunch of different genres,

38
00:02:23,676 --> 00:02:28,700
a bunch of different games, different kind of context when it comes to game studios.

39
00:02:29,381 --> 00:02:34,404
And as much as Among Us is a very huge TikTok account, I think there's a lot of lessons that

40
00:02:34,484 --> 00:02:39,388
I learned throughout all three of them that can be applied to whichever kind of TikTok account you

41
00:02:39,428 --> 00:02:39,628
have.

42
00:02:41,248 --> 00:02:44,674
OK, so let's kind of get started a little brief intro,

43
00:02:45,095 --> 00:02:45,916
all that kind of stuff.

44
00:02:47,018 --> 00:02:49,582
So this is a study that was done by TikTok.

45
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:52,090
conducted by material.

46
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:55,493
So just a heads up that, you know, there might be some bias there.

47
00:02:55,973 --> 00:02:59,256
But according to the study that they did, TikTokers are one point

48
00:02:59,296 --> 00:03:03,720
five times more likely to immediately go out and buy something or wishlist

49
00:03:03,740 --> 00:03:07,943
something they discovered on the platform compared to kind of other platform users.

50
00:03:07,983 --> 00:03:12,387
And this is sort of the big thing of why everyone keeps talking about TikTok.

51
00:03:12,867 --> 00:03:20,551
It's just that the discoverability for it in terms of other social media platforms is quite good in terms of their algorithm.

52
00:03:21,151 --> 00:03:26,453
People continually learning something new. So learning more updates about your game, learning more about your game.

53
00:03:26,773 --> 00:03:30,595
That's a huge part of it. And of course, just being inspired.

54
00:03:30,875 --> 00:03:37,098
And there's a lot of really great indie games out there and, you know, AAA games out there that it's really.

55
00:03:38,078 --> 00:03:44,380
interesting to see the ways in which they inspire other TikTok users and really make it into the

56
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,741
cultural zeitgeist, I suppose. So really briefly, again, I'm going to go back into Among Us,

57
00:03:50,221 --> 00:03:54,782
again, a little more in-depth about it. So we launched, as I said, in December 2020.

58
00:03:55,262 --> 00:04:04,223
We got a ton of followers within the first six months, which is very, not actually, not that

59
00:04:04,344 --> 00:04:06,824
rare in terms of TikTok. Okay.

60
00:04:07,344 --> 00:04:11,308
That's a lot. It's a little bit, it's rare in terms of TikTok growth to have that many,

61
00:04:11,948 --> 00:04:16,593
but you will often see like when a lot of indie games or a lot of other studios kind of talk

62
00:04:16,633 --> 00:04:22,378
about that the amount of follows that you get on an account does kind of exceed the rate in

63
00:04:22,438 --> 00:04:29,004
which you would see on like Twitter or Facebook, if you're using that, or Instagram, that sort of thing.

64
00:04:30,302 --> 00:04:35,323
And for context, I am the person who's currently working on all the community and marketing side

65
00:04:35,383 --> 00:04:40,044
stuff in Among Us, which means that I don't get as much time as I would like on it because I have

66
00:04:40,064 --> 00:04:44,845
so many other things to do. And the goal for our Among Us account, which might be different for

67
00:04:44,905 --> 00:04:51,127
your accounts, was brand awareness, engagement, and sustainability. So sustainability of our

68
00:04:51,167 --> 00:04:55,988
community because at this point, we had really good discoverability. So that wasn't one of the

69
00:04:56,028 --> 00:04:57,348
goals for the Among Us account.

70
00:04:58,101 --> 00:05:01,364
And of course, huge caveat, Among Us already had a huge player base.

71
00:05:01,384 --> 00:05:05,187
By the time I launched the TikTok, I don't really take credit for all the growth there.

72
00:05:07,249 --> 00:05:09,872
And in terms of effort that I put into it.

73
00:05:09,972 --> 00:05:14,236
So for the Among Us account, I put in about one video per week at minimum.

74
00:05:14,916 --> 00:05:15,957
I would love to do more.

75
00:05:16,037 --> 00:05:20,281
But as I said, it's a little bit difficult because I have so many other things to do.

76
00:05:20,882 --> 00:05:23,184
So at my frequency, I go once per week.

77
00:05:23,224 --> 00:05:23,744
And I did that.

78
00:05:24,365 --> 00:05:30,416
for the same thing for unpacking, where I did one video a week and Kit Fox was around

79
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:35,165
two videos of a week if I could swing it. But again, there's a lot of things going on,

80
00:05:35,225 --> 00:05:37,209
so I often couldn't do as many as I wanted.

81
00:05:37,983 --> 00:05:41,764
I honestly consider the effort that you have to put into TikTok quite high.

82
00:05:41,844 --> 00:05:45,244
So unlike like a tweet where you can just type it out or something,

83
00:05:45,965 --> 00:05:49,365
creation for me takes around 15 minutes to one hour per video,

84
00:05:49,385 --> 00:05:54,146
depending on how magnificent you want and how much editing you're doing.

85
00:05:54,967 --> 00:05:58,727
The trends can take one to two hours per week in order just to like scroll

86
00:05:58,787 --> 00:06:00,708
through it and read and watch.

87
00:06:01,388 --> 00:06:02,608
all the things that are going on.

88
00:06:03,109 --> 00:06:05,829
And also I put in like an hour per week on engagement.

89
00:06:05,869 --> 00:06:07,610
So that could be like going through other videos

90
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,190
and liking them and commenting on them,

91
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:11,531
going through our own comments and commenting through them.

92
00:06:12,231 --> 00:06:14,652
Basically personality and cultural understanding

93
00:06:14,752 --> 00:06:18,153
of TikTok has to be quite on point and engaging with it.

94
00:06:18,233 --> 00:06:22,155
So it is quite a high effort social media platform.

95
00:06:22,175 --> 00:06:23,515
So I just wanted to warn you about that.

96
00:06:24,996 --> 00:06:25,716
All right, so.

97
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,846
I will soon get to the case studies, but I really want to go over building a brand identifier

98
00:06:31,886 --> 00:06:32,527
on TikTok.

99
00:06:33,188 --> 00:06:39,337
This kind of goes through a very social media general strategy, but there are some unique

100
00:06:39,357 --> 00:06:41,299
considerations I put into TikTok structure.

101
00:06:41,660 --> 00:06:44,361
So the first thing is like, you really want to talk...

102
00:06:44,822 --> 00:06:46,803
Think about how you want to be recognized on TikTok

103
00:06:46,823 --> 00:06:47,743
because that's a huge thing.

104
00:06:47,783 --> 00:06:48,724
It's so visual, right?

105
00:06:49,084 --> 00:06:50,865
So the first thing is style and tone.

106
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:52,766
So how you want to sound on TikTok.

107
00:06:52,786 --> 00:06:54,227
Do you want to be quirky, wholesome,

108
00:06:54,367 --> 00:06:56,248
relatable, calming, competitive?

109
00:06:56,548 --> 00:06:58,389
I usually pick three big adjectives

110
00:06:58,429 --> 00:07:00,090
that will describe your overall content.

111
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:02,171
And then everything kind of trickles down from there.

112
00:07:02,212 --> 00:07:03,372
So what lighting we'll use?

113
00:07:03,652 --> 00:07:04,953
How polished will things look?

114
00:07:05,193 --> 00:07:06,754
What kind of content will you create?

115
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,296
How do you want your audience to understand you?

116
00:07:10,116 --> 00:07:14,879
Then you go for consistent brand elements. So it's really beneficial for a TikTok account

117
00:07:14,979 --> 00:07:19,181
to have one person or character continually and distinctly appear in videos.

118
00:07:19,561 --> 00:07:23,403
So scrolling through videos is really quick and not everyone checks the username and profile

119
00:07:23,423 --> 00:07:27,766
pic. So having a distinct face someone can immediately associate with your TikTok account

120
00:07:28,106 --> 00:07:32,969
really helps people identify your content easily. And it's very common for people to

121
00:07:33,009 --> 00:07:37,651
have only 1 to 2 people actually appear in a TikTok when it comes to their own account.

122
00:07:38,437 --> 00:07:40,338
If you don't want to use your face, totally fine.

123
00:07:40,398 --> 00:07:41,679
Just use consistent elements.

124
00:07:41,979 --> 00:07:44,461
You can have certain lighting, a distinctive mark, an object,

125
00:07:44,481 --> 00:07:46,822
a color palette, a video game character.

126
00:07:47,462 --> 00:07:50,424
Unpacking, for example, didn't have any characters whatsoever.

127
00:07:50,524 --> 00:07:53,566
So we really went with really distinct elements of it.

128
00:07:55,313 --> 00:08:00,116
Hook, the first one to three seconds of a video is extremely important, as with anything.

129
00:08:00,156 --> 00:08:02,538
I'm sure you've heard the word hook so many times now.

130
00:08:03,258 --> 00:08:07,401
But you do really want to front load your video with the most interesting thing possible.

131
00:08:07,521 --> 00:08:08,962
And it doesn't even need to be visual.

132
00:08:09,062 --> 00:08:12,944
It could be a question like, how did I make feet move in my game?

133
00:08:13,145 --> 00:08:18,368
Or times I use the Among Us account for my own personal gain, and everyone hates this

134
00:08:18,408 --> 00:08:19,509
task or something like that.

135
00:08:19,589 --> 00:08:23,511
Basically pose an idea and use the rest of the video to expand on it.

136
00:08:23,992 --> 00:08:29,576
And then you have trends and this is a beautiful way to keep engagement, right? TikTok is known

137
00:08:29,616 --> 00:08:34,379
for its viral trends and hopping onto that in a timely manner is really nice because if you

138
00:08:34,419 --> 00:08:39,162
can't think of anything or if you want people to stick around for something, they'll tend to do it

139
00:08:39,402 --> 00:08:42,885
if there is like a trend that they know like a hook or some punchline is coming.

140
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,661
And a lot of people think, like, does creating a brand voice

141
00:08:46,721 --> 00:08:48,501
really matter, especially if I'm indie?

142
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:49,802
And it does, I think.

143
00:08:50,542 --> 00:08:52,682
And according to the Sprout Social Index,

144
00:08:53,783 --> 00:08:56,344
some of the reasons why brands stood out more than others,

145
00:08:56,484 --> 00:08:59,045
according to consumers, was things

146
00:08:59,085 --> 00:09:02,786
like memorable content, personality,

147
00:09:03,026 --> 00:09:06,107
or distinct personality, and compelling storytelling.

148
00:09:07,087 --> 00:09:10,514
And a lot of times with social, we're not gunning for like a one-hit viral thing.

149
00:09:10,554 --> 00:09:15,422
We're really aiming for sustainable, practical, practical community engagement.

150
00:09:15,703 --> 00:09:18,708
And we can create content that is memorable and keeps us at the top of mind.

151
00:09:19,866 --> 00:09:24,029
All right, so I'm going to go a little bit more in depth into the actual Among Us videos that we've done.

152
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:30,053
So there are kind of five content types that I found really helpful for me when it comes to Among Us.

153
00:09:30,133 --> 00:09:37,658
Those are things are game updates. So these are ongoing updates about the game, whether it's bug fixes or huge announcements, personality, TikTok.

154
00:09:37,698 --> 00:09:40,680
So videos hopping on trends or having fun with the community.

155
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:45,744
Behind the scenes things, this shows off more developer focused looks at the games and what

156
00:09:45,784 --> 00:09:46,705
goes into making it.

157
00:09:47,646 --> 00:09:51,229
Gameplay, so videos that focus on game content that is already out.

158
00:09:51,609 --> 00:09:56,253
And miscellaneous things, so this could be reactions, we have merchandise, so I use merchandise,

159
00:09:56,794 --> 00:09:57,294
that sort of thing.

160
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,823
And game updates by far get the highest engagement and share rate for Among Us.

161
00:10:03,023 --> 00:10:04,845
This isn't really a shock.

162
00:10:04,885 --> 00:10:08,728
The difficulty here is really to make a game update interesting sometimes,

163
00:10:09,108 --> 00:10:11,470
especially when you know you don't have much to show for it

164
00:10:11,791 --> 00:10:15,093
or you need it to keep people informed about things like bug fixes,

165
00:10:15,133 --> 00:10:16,274
which is a little bit difficult.

166
00:10:17,595 --> 00:10:22,716
But I do try to keep these as short as possible. Generally, people always recommend to keep

167
00:10:22,736 --> 00:10:26,457
these as short as possible, like any TikTok as short as possible, just because the looping

168
00:10:26,477 --> 00:10:33,299
is really good for the algorithm. But it all varies. Anyways, so when it comes to the actual

169
00:10:33,319 --> 00:10:38,540
game updates, some things that I've done that have worked really well is really focusing

170
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:42,781
the TikTok, right? So we've had like Among Us updates where it was like, hey, these are

171
00:10:42,881 --> 00:10:46,442
all the things that are happening. And instead, I just broke it apart into

172
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:51,044
bit by bit pieces. So for example, we had an update on June 30th that introduced a bunch

173
00:10:51,084 --> 00:10:55,267
of new things, but the one standout thing was we had a new task that was vent cleaning.

174
00:10:55,287 --> 00:10:59,790
And then part of, you know, really understanding your community and knowing what makes them tick

175
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:03,512
and really what like makes them laugh or makes them excited is to.

176
00:11:04,433 --> 00:11:09,216
know what they talk about. So a lot of people talked about vent cleaning being a kind of joke

177
00:11:09,276 --> 00:11:15,060
task in Among Us or a joke excuse. And we actually implemented it. And so when I put it into the

178
00:11:15,100 --> 00:11:19,403
TikTok, that was the only thing that I focused on. And I didn't talk about any of the other things

179
00:11:19,423 --> 00:11:23,546
that we had. And I was just like, hey, we have vent cleaning. And that made it more interesting

180
00:11:23,866 --> 00:11:28,450
than just like a casual bug update, a casual update full of fixes and stuff like that.

181
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:32,995
There was also another time where we updated the game,

182
00:11:33,075 --> 00:11:34,976
and I'm sure many of you have been through this before,

183
00:11:35,316 --> 00:11:36,397
and it just broke the game.

184
00:11:36,838 --> 00:11:38,699
Like, it wasn't working.

185
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:43,483
And the hard thing on TikTok is to really communicate,

186
00:11:43,503 --> 00:11:45,004
especially when you have a big community on it,

187
00:11:45,104 --> 00:11:46,245
is to just communicate,

188
00:11:46,665 --> 00:11:48,046
hey, we're working on bug fixes,

189
00:11:48,066 --> 00:11:49,167
because you can't just tweet out.

190
00:11:49,928 --> 00:11:54,151
hey, we're you can't just tweet out on TweetTalk. Hey, we're working on bug fixes and do a quick

191
00:11:54,171 --> 00:12:00,235
status update. So, for this, I kind of hopped onto a trending meme at the time, which was like

192
00:12:00,455 --> 00:12:04,558
a song which you can't hear and the gesture. And I really made fun of the fact that we

193
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:08,520
completely broke the game, which people took really well and we got a lot of software developers

194
00:12:08,580 --> 00:12:13,163
relating to the video, too. And it really successfully conveyed information about

195
00:12:13,203 --> 00:12:18,106
keeping the game updated and that we were aware of the problems that people had with a meme.

196
00:12:18,447 --> 00:12:18,947
So, that's cool.

197
00:12:21,321 --> 00:12:25,323
So these TikToks that I'm going to talk about next are the personality-based TikToks.

198
00:12:25,363 --> 00:12:29,484
These are super varied in terms of our virality, but that's okay though.

199
00:12:29,524 --> 00:12:33,146
The point of these TikToks aren't necessarily to get big numbers, though it's always nice,

200
00:12:33,726 --> 00:12:37,948
but to solidify our tone with the community and create that connection as an indie studio.

201
00:12:37,988 --> 00:12:39,709
And these videos can often be longer.

202
00:12:41,685 --> 00:12:44,425
All right, so the one that I'm kind of focusing on here

203
00:12:44,686 --> 00:12:47,246
is that at the time of posting TikTok,

204
00:12:47,286 --> 00:12:49,247
the only question I was getting in comments

205
00:12:49,387 --> 00:12:52,168
was stuff about where the new map was.

206
00:12:52,528 --> 00:12:53,428
And you can get this too.

207
00:12:53,448 --> 00:12:54,708
You can be like, oh God,

208
00:12:54,748 --> 00:12:57,049
like everyone keeps asking me when the release date is.

209
00:12:57,169 --> 00:12:59,350
Everyone keeps asking me if it's coming out on mobile,

210
00:12:59,430 --> 00:13:00,170
that sort of thing.

211
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:03,291
And hopping onto a trend and really like.

212
00:13:04,011 --> 00:13:09,416
not being afraid to be honest with your TikTok community is one of the things that they just like love the most.

213
00:13:10,176 --> 00:13:17,402
Even more so than like a lot of other social media platforms I found that they've just really latched on to this kind of self-awareness.

214
00:13:19,015 --> 00:13:20,556
Next, we have behind-the-scenes videos.

215
00:13:20,616 --> 00:13:23,298
These, honestly, for me, are the worst performing ones.

216
00:13:23,398 --> 00:13:25,419
And I think it's because I'm not very good at them.

217
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:29,502
I've seen other indie studios do so good with them.

218
00:13:29,722 --> 00:13:31,103
And I don't know.

219
00:13:31,403 --> 00:13:33,024
It could be because I'm making it wrong.

220
00:13:33,224 --> 00:13:35,606
It could also be because the majority of our community

221
00:13:35,666 --> 00:13:38,267
really cares about new items and not really old ones.

222
00:13:38,748 --> 00:13:40,088
But that's OK.

223
00:13:40,128 --> 00:13:41,689
The videos here tend to be longer

224
00:13:41,809 --> 00:13:44,031
and aren't necessarily a target for the For You page,

225
00:13:44,071 --> 00:13:44,811
for me anyway.

226
00:13:44,871 --> 00:13:47,173
They're usually more just to get our community engaged.

227
00:13:48,246 --> 00:13:51,927
So for example, you can answer questions from TikToks,

228
00:13:52,187 --> 00:13:54,368
like in the TikTok comments and respond to them.

229
00:13:54,448 --> 00:13:56,128
And that could be a way that you talk about

230
00:13:56,168 --> 00:13:57,249
more behind the scenes stuff.

231
00:13:58,769 --> 00:14:01,490
Here, it probably would have been a better hook

232
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:03,351
if maybe I'd like shown a little more

233
00:14:03,711 --> 00:14:06,832
of the actual Among Us character, but that's all right.

234
00:14:06,952 --> 00:14:09,012
It's one of those things where you can kind of learn

235
00:14:09,412 --> 00:14:12,493
from videos that don't do as well.

236
00:14:13,334 --> 00:14:15,134
And also just like, you know, reading the comments

237
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:16,755
and being able to respond to them.

238
00:14:17,912 --> 00:14:19,113
Next are the gameplay videos.

239
00:14:19,833 --> 00:14:21,054
These focus on gameplay.

240
00:14:21,554 --> 00:14:24,156
It takes content straight from the game

241
00:14:24,216 --> 00:14:26,037
and plops it into a fun little video.

242
00:14:26,597 --> 00:14:28,178
And these tend to do relatively well,

243
00:14:28,218 --> 00:14:30,099
but they definitely vary due to the fact

244
00:14:30,139 --> 00:14:32,660
gameplay can cover anything from difficult tasks,

245
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,382
gameplay styles, looking at game details, that sort of thing.

246
00:14:37,003 --> 00:14:44,066
And, again, it's really important, I think, to really hone in on one part of the gameplay

247
00:14:44,246 --> 00:14:49,389
aspect. So, for example, we had an update for Among Us roles, and the actual trailer

248
00:14:49,429 --> 00:14:56,392
that I put onto the TikTok account didn't do super well. But this video that I just

249
00:14:56,612 --> 00:15:01,675
talked about focusing on the shapeshifter kill and showing it in the game did way better

250
00:15:01,715 --> 00:15:04,576
in terms of views. So that's a really interesting thing.

251
00:15:05,958 --> 00:15:08,819
Miscellaneous stuff, merchandise, reacts, interactions,

252
00:15:08,899 --> 00:15:10,899
Among Us has plenty of other things to talk about,

253
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:11,619
and you may too.

254
00:15:12,039 --> 00:15:13,420
So whether it's duetting videos

255
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:15,680
or showing off new merchandise,

256
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,961
I find it just really fun to be able to talk about it.

257
00:15:19,661 --> 00:15:21,201
One of the things that I will say

258
00:15:21,221 --> 00:15:23,201
is that it does much better than I thought,

259
00:15:23,241 --> 00:15:24,642
but you have to be very careful

260
00:15:24,762 --> 00:15:27,802
about not straight up being like, buy this thing,

261
00:15:28,162 --> 00:15:30,123
because I feel like the algorithm

262
00:15:30,223 --> 00:15:31,403
or like TikTok on the back end

263
00:15:31,483 --> 00:15:34,023
doesn't really like the whole like, buy, buy, buy thing.

264
00:15:35,564 --> 00:15:39,288
So instead, what I usually do is just literally show off like the product.

265
00:15:39,369 --> 00:15:41,591
Don't even say honestly, like where they can get it.

266
00:15:41,631 --> 00:15:46,097
You can put a website maybe in the comments or something or like respond to people.

267
00:15:46,938 --> 00:15:49,542
But otherwise, people just really like looking at cool stuff.

268
00:15:49,582 --> 00:15:52,666
And merch, for sure, is one of those things that is big on TikTok.

269
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:58,413
All this to say is that I've shown you videos that have a lot of views,

270
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,656
but it is still a learning process.

271
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:06,701
You can see on the top left, I have a video that had 100K views.

272
00:16:06,781 --> 00:16:10,664
And that's not as much as the one right below it, which is 12.9 million views.

273
00:16:11,065 --> 00:16:13,407
It really is one of those things where I...

274
00:16:15,082 --> 00:16:19,905
No, don't. I wouldn't trust anyone who just guarantees that you can go viral all the time.

275
00:16:20,065 --> 00:16:25,009
It is definitely just working and figuring out what content works with your community

276
00:16:25,389 --> 00:16:30,052
and continually kind of testing it. And that's really important, I think, when it comes to TikTok,

277
00:16:30,072 --> 00:16:34,075
but also when it comes to any social media platform is really testing and keeping track

278
00:16:34,115 --> 00:16:39,239
of what works and what doesn't work. And how do we actually measure success?

279
00:16:40,597 --> 00:16:42,478
So this is a very rough overview.

280
00:16:42,518 --> 00:16:44,839
This is just like a snippet I took out of a spreadsheet.

281
00:16:45,560 --> 00:16:48,321
But this is the kinds of ways that I track,

282
00:16:48,361 --> 00:16:50,283
like how well is something actually doing?

283
00:16:50,863 --> 00:16:52,244
What is our engagement percentage?

284
00:16:52,264 --> 00:16:53,925
Because that's something that's really important to me.

285
00:16:54,385 --> 00:16:56,787
And from this, we can determine things

286
00:16:56,867 --> 00:16:59,388
like personalized TikToks get the highest engagement

287
00:16:59,428 --> 00:17:01,189
compared to other categories, particularly

288
00:17:01,209 --> 00:17:02,510
in the number of people commenting.

289
00:17:03,131 --> 00:17:06,934
However, game update TikToks usually get the most visibility overall.

290
00:17:06,994 --> 00:17:08,535
So it's like, what am I aiming for?

291
00:17:08,555 --> 00:17:09,756
Am I aiming for visibility?

292
00:17:09,776 --> 00:17:10,917
Am I aiming for engagement?

293
00:17:11,578 --> 00:17:16,202
The most shareable content was the water bottle video, which makes sense because people probably

294
00:17:16,222 --> 00:17:18,244
wanted other people to see the merch and to buy it.

295
00:17:19,205 --> 00:17:20,546
That really happens quite a bit.

296
00:17:21,166 --> 00:17:24,789
And the second most shareable content was usually anything involving game updates because

297
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,431
people would tell their friends, like, hey.

298
00:17:28,072 --> 00:17:30,193
let's play this or they share it with their communities.

299
00:17:30,653 --> 00:17:34,915
Behind the scenes videos are things that I probably shouldn't post a lot of or I should

300
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:39,817
really change what I do because it is not doing as well as the other categories.

301
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:43,759
And gameplay is more like solid middle of the road content.

302
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:47,441
And the For You page is obviously the best place to be in for visibility.

303
00:17:47,461 --> 00:17:49,421
But once people are on your profile page,

304
00:17:49,461 --> 00:17:52,583
having content that interests them will really help boost stats.

305
00:17:54,770 --> 00:17:58,192
It's really all about thinking like, you know, what are your goals for TikTok?

306
00:17:58,593 --> 00:18:01,094
Is it just views that hopefully convert to wish lists?

307
00:18:01,115 --> 00:18:04,117
Do you want engagement on the platform? Are you aiming for shares?

308
00:18:04,577 --> 00:18:06,899
Overall, pay attention to what's happening with your content

309
00:18:07,099 --> 00:18:09,441
so you can better prepare for success on the platform.

310
00:18:11,422 --> 00:18:12,903
All right, so this is another chart.

311
00:18:13,544 --> 00:18:17,266
Shout out to SystemChalk on Twitter for this,

312
00:18:17,406 --> 00:18:19,007
who is an amazing economist

313
00:18:19,067 --> 00:18:20,388
and really helped me out with this.

314
00:18:21,129 --> 00:18:23,350
We plotted this Among Us data on a graph

315
00:18:23,390 --> 00:18:24,591
that measures engagement

316
00:18:24,691 --> 00:18:26,772
and found that overall engagement percentage

317
00:18:26,812 --> 00:18:29,674
doesn't actually really shift based on the video length.

318
00:18:30,115 --> 00:18:32,256
So if you consider success to be people watching

319
00:18:32,316 --> 00:18:34,617
to the end of something, then shorter videos are better,

320
00:18:35,078 --> 00:18:36,599
but we didn't really see anything

321
00:18:36,639 --> 00:18:38,200
that indicated longer videos

322
00:18:38,240 --> 00:18:39,681
were hurting engagement measures.

323
00:18:40,231 --> 00:18:41,812
We also did a plot for length and views.

324
00:18:41,852 --> 00:18:43,674
And while it does show a negative trend,

325
00:18:43,754 --> 00:18:45,435
it's not a very strong relationship.

326
00:18:45,875 --> 00:18:47,296
I'm not saying completely irrelevant

327
00:18:47,357 --> 00:18:49,238
because the three longest videos are also

328
00:18:49,298 --> 00:18:50,499
the bottom three for views.

329
00:18:50,699 --> 00:18:53,061
And the TikTok algorithm does reward videos

330
00:18:53,081 --> 00:18:54,642
that get rewatched over and over.

331
00:18:55,423 --> 00:18:57,705
But it's fair to say that at least part of the connection

332
00:18:57,745 --> 00:18:59,866
is that we just have more success in the short video

333
00:18:59,906 --> 00:19:00,146
club.

334
00:19:00,947 --> 00:19:02,828
None of this really counts as a breakthrough, by the way,

335
00:19:03,209 --> 00:19:03,669
or anything.

336
00:19:04,628 --> 00:19:07,810
really, especially considering how small our sample size is

337
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:08,771
with the Among Us account,

338
00:19:09,392 --> 00:19:11,573
but as in like the number of videos we have.

339
00:19:12,254 --> 00:19:13,975
But we were just curious about the length

340
00:19:14,075 --> 00:19:16,177
and was a little surprised to see how stable

341
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:17,298
the engagement measure was

342
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,159
no matter how long the video was.

343
00:19:20,180 --> 00:19:21,581
And this is what it looks like for Among Us,

344
00:19:21,641 --> 00:19:23,543
but it's possible this graph might look different

345
00:19:23,563 --> 00:19:24,944
for other game audiences.

346
00:19:25,224 --> 00:19:27,986
As with any content, things really vary from game to game.

347
00:19:28,952 --> 00:19:34,835
And all of this is to say, people getting excited and informed about your game is never a straight line.

348
00:19:35,735 --> 00:19:38,936
It's really this infinite loop that again, TikTok put out.

349
00:19:39,356 --> 00:19:44,098
It's about discoverability, consideration, review, and participation with your videos.

350
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:51,401
And according to the study, 44% of the daily TikTok users did want branded content to be fun and entertaining.

351
00:19:52,182 --> 00:19:55,247
Again, it's just it's this loop of figuring out what people want,

352
00:19:55,407 --> 00:19:56,670
what people are responding to.

353
00:19:56,690 --> 00:20:01,298
And I wouldn't be discouraged if it doesn't work out all at once in the beginning.

354
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,992
And I'm going to really briefly go over the community

355
00:20:05,052 --> 00:20:07,213
and being part of it because some initial warnings

356
00:20:07,293 --> 00:20:08,874
if you haven't been on TikTok before,

357
00:20:09,214 --> 00:20:10,815
expect to see two comments the most.

358
00:20:11,115 --> 00:20:13,277
Will this game be on mobile and is it free?

359
00:20:13,857 --> 00:20:16,478
Don't forget TikTok is a mobile only app basically.

360
00:20:16,538 --> 00:20:19,120
So obviously the users will be prioritizing their phone

361
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:22,082
but also many are used to free mobile games being the norm.

362
00:20:22,422 --> 00:20:25,364
This isn't to discourage you to say TikTok users won't buy

363
00:20:25,464 --> 00:20:29,046
or wishlist your game on PC or console.

364
00:20:29,586 --> 00:20:34,008
Definitely the opposite. It's just that I want to warn you and like any platform,

365
00:20:34,028 --> 00:20:39,911
there are biases and types of comments you may see and, you know, just be aware. Don't take it

366
00:20:40,191 --> 00:20:43,193
too much to heart. People do care about your game even if they ask if it's free.

367
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,064
And it isn't always easy, right?

368
00:20:46,124 --> 00:20:50,327
So to be perfectly clear, initial viral TikToks

369
00:20:50,367 --> 00:20:51,808
that I got on the Among Us account

370
00:20:51,848 --> 00:20:54,010
were just inundated with dead game comments.

371
00:20:54,290 --> 00:20:56,111
Any big game you can see, they just

372
00:20:56,131 --> 00:20:57,912
get so many dead game comments.

373
00:20:58,413 --> 00:21:00,714
That isn't to say you have to give up on the platform,

374
00:21:00,754 --> 00:21:02,215
though, when you do get negativity.

375
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:06,158
At least engaging with it really helps people pay attention

376
00:21:06,198 --> 00:21:08,280
to who is reading and who is engaging with the comments.

377
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:10,941
And again, why?

378
00:21:10,961 --> 00:21:12,961
It's because it's not just about going viral.

379
00:21:13,041 --> 00:21:15,922
It really is about building a sustainable, long-term community

380
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:16,682
for your studio.

381
00:21:16,742 --> 00:21:18,822
And if you hate going on a social media platform

382
00:21:18,902 --> 00:21:21,923
or your studio hates going on a social media platform

383
00:21:22,223 --> 00:21:23,723
because the comments are really bad,

384
00:21:23,983 --> 00:21:25,203
that's not a great place to be in.

385
00:21:25,743 --> 00:21:27,584
So really leaning into it can, if you

386
00:21:27,624 --> 00:21:30,764
have the mental capacity, change the sentiment, create fans,

387
00:21:30,824 --> 00:21:32,765
and highlight those that are already in your corner

388
00:21:32,865 --> 00:21:35,045
and create a healthier space for your team.

389
00:21:35,906 --> 00:21:37,806
And really analyzing the negativity.

390
00:21:37,846 --> 00:21:38,527
Is it bugs?

391
00:21:38,647 --> 00:21:40,907
Is it lack of updates, a viral thing, et cetera?

392
00:21:41,307 --> 00:21:43,828
It's something that I really went into where

393
00:21:43,948 --> 00:21:46,749
after a period of honestly me being like, I hate it here,

394
00:21:47,609 --> 00:21:49,429
I started responding to more comments.

395
00:21:50,089 --> 00:21:52,450
Because I know how lovely TikTok can be.

396
00:21:52,510 --> 00:21:53,990
So I started responding to things

397
00:21:54,050 --> 00:21:57,451
and actually as among us, just not punching down on people,

398
00:21:57,511 --> 00:22:00,112
but trying to be like, hey, I appreciate you're here.

399
00:22:00,172 --> 00:22:01,732
Or hey, I'm just reading these comments,

400
00:22:01,812 --> 00:22:03,193
even if it's a joke, right?

401
00:22:04,093 --> 00:22:05,435
And it actually started working, right?

402
00:22:05,455 --> 00:22:09,059
So we can see here, people started being a little bit nicer about things.

403
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:12,262
And then on the left, again, another example of me

404
00:22:12,302 --> 00:22:15,766
just kind of responding to a very negative comment.

405
00:22:15,826 --> 00:22:18,989
And the thing about TikTok comments is it doesn't like really or I don't know

406
00:22:19,049 --> 00:22:19,850
how they order it.

407
00:22:20,250 --> 00:22:24,193
But some things will just like pop up at the top, even if you respond,

408
00:22:24,613 --> 00:22:26,895
even if you don't respond to them, even if you do respond to them,

409
00:22:26,935 --> 00:22:29,137
just because it's getting a lot of engagement.

410
00:22:29,557 --> 00:22:32,499
So often at the times at the top, we'd see like dead game comments.

411
00:22:32,519 --> 00:22:35,961
So I just make sure I respond to those because you can see my reply below.

412
00:22:36,282 --> 00:22:38,343
And then on the right, you can see kind of the sentiment

413
00:22:38,743 --> 00:22:40,265
start to change where people were like.

414
00:22:41,611 --> 00:22:44,112
hey, why are you actually, why are you saying this?

415
00:22:44,413 --> 00:22:45,153
That's kind of mean.

416
00:22:45,833 --> 00:22:47,934
And again, it's one of those things where

417
00:22:48,195 --> 00:22:50,136
being an indie game studio doesn't really help with this

418
00:22:50,196 --> 00:22:52,737
and just being a person that is responding to it

419
00:22:52,917 --> 00:22:55,259
and people understanding there's a person behind the count

420
00:22:55,459 --> 00:22:56,319
has really helped.

421
00:22:57,320 --> 00:23:00,061
All of this to say is basically to make an effort

422
00:23:00,121 --> 00:23:02,202
to be a part of the community that you post in.

423
00:23:02,583 --> 00:23:04,744
Understand and pay attention to how the community

424
00:23:05,024 --> 00:23:08,466
interacts in the space, the language they use, even emojis.

425
00:23:10,012 --> 00:23:12,193
All right, so we're almost near the end.

426
00:23:12,273 --> 00:23:13,553
And then I can take questions because I

427
00:23:13,613 --> 00:23:15,294
know there are a bunch of questions in chat.

428
00:23:15,474 --> 00:23:17,955
And maybe there are a bunch of questions in the audience.

429
00:23:18,195 --> 00:23:18,635
I'm not sure.

430
00:23:20,056 --> 00:23:22,437
But this is important.

431
00:23:22,597 --> 00:23:26,378
Why have I kept talking about TikTok, about social media,

432
00:23:26,438 --> 00:23:28,579
that sort of thing, especially when you maybe

433
00:23:28,619 --> 00:23:31,961
have heard it's not super great in terms of conversion,

434
00:23:32,461 --> 00:23:34,162
in terms of all social media platforms?

435
00:23:34,622 --> 00:23:36,823
So this is a study by Hootsuite's Digital 2022

436
00:23:36,863 --> 00:23:37,003
report.

437
00:23:38,871 --> 00:23:40,393
And the interesting thing about this graph

438
00:23:40,673 --> 00:23:42,755
is that it measured the percentage of internet users

439
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:45,638
who use each channel as a primary source of information

440
00:23:45,718 --> 00:23:46,639
when researching brands.

441
00:23:46,959 --> 00:23:49,341
Though, keep in mind, this is not game-specific or anything,

442
00:23:49,361 --> 00:23:51,063
so there's some messiness here.

443
00:23:51,083 --> 00:23:53,466
And we can see on the lower part of this graph, from 35

444
00:23:53,666 --> 00:23:55,948
to 64-year-olds, is as we expect.

445
00:23:56,288 --> 00:23:59,031
Find a brand on Google, any search engine,

446
00:23:59,111 --> 00:24:01,193
for more information about the brand, its offerings,

447
00:24:01,253 --> 00:24:01,794
and what it's like.

448
00:24:02,348 --> 00:24:06,091
The interesting part is the youngest age group here, 16 to 24 year olds.

449
00:24:06,771 --> 00:24:10,053
And the younger we get on this graph, the more we see social networks are actually the

450
00:24:10,093 --> 00:24:12,234
places people go to search up a brand.

451
00:24:12,595 --> 00:24:15,997
And this group is the one that does it over a search engine.

452
00:24:16,537 --> 00:24:19,138
And I'm not 16 to 24.

453
00:24:19,499 --> 00:24:24,622
However, I can confirm that actually I have started using social media.

454
00:24:24,662 --> 00:24:29,285
I will type it in, in like Instagram or something when I want to find out more about

455
00:24:29,845 --> 00:24:33,593
any kind of product because honestly, it's just easier for me that way.

456
00:24:34,314 --> 00:24:39,445
And this isn't to say SEO or anything isn't important. It's just that as you know,

457
00:24:41,595 --> 00:24:46,220
we kind of build a culturally relevant brand, it means we need to engage with culturally

458
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:50,604
relevant platforms. And things are always changing. I understand it's really stressful.

459
00:24:51,084 --> 00:24:56,389
There was a MySpace. Now there is no MySpace. Facebook. I don't even know what Facebook is

460
00:24:56,429 --> 00:25:01,594
doing. And now we have TikTok. And we have so many other things. And there's probably

461
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:04,036
more and more things coming. And it can be really stressful.

462
00:25:04,997 --> 00:25:10,410
I understand, but there are reasons to which, you know, we want to engage with these platforms

463
00:25:10,430 --> 00:25:14,541
as studios, as games, as people, whatever.

464
00:25:15,852 --> 00:25:17,433
And again, this is what works for Among Us,

465
00:25:17,533 --> 00:25:21,575
and this is how we got all this data with experimentation,

466
00:25:21,595 --> 00:25:23,196
a little bit of flexibility, agility.

467
00:25:23,296 --> 00:25:25,978
All of these are super important for our constantly morphing

468
00:25:26,018 --> 00:25:28,400
platform like TikTok, where the trends are driven

469
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,161
by users and internet memes.

470
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:33,543
And working with data alongside cultural interest in the space

471
00:25:33,603 --> 00:25:36,265
is key to making a successful brand in a space like this.

472
00:25:37,283 --> 00:25:38,223
Engage with your community.

473
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:40,924
Remember, it's not just about numbers going up,

474
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:43,765
but having a healthy and thriving long-term player

475
00:25:43,805 --> 00:25:44,046
base.

476
00:25:44,546 --> 00:25:46,727
And then as bigger the player base goes,

477
00:25:46,767 --> 00:25:49,008
maybe you can depend a little less on social media platforms

478
00:25:49,068 --> 00:25:50,928
if that's not your thing, if that's not what you like.

479
00:25:51,749 --> 00:25:54,490
And as I said, you really want to engage with the platforms

480
00:25:54,530 --> 00:25:56,711
to be a culturally relevant continuing brand,

481
00:25:56,971 --> 00:26:00,972
but also be a brand that engages and is conscious of the world

482
00:26:00,992 --> 00:26:01,753
that it's a part of.

483
00:26:02,373 --> 00:26:04,614
Hopefully, you want to make a good mark wherever you are too.

484
00:26:05,274 --> 00:26:08,556
And every brand success measures by far are very different,

485
00:26:08,676 --> 00:26:11,197
but merging quantitative and qualitative data

486
00:26:11,317 --> 00:26:12,617
will take you very far.

487
00:26:14,298 --> 00:26:18,160
Thank you for listening to me babble on for quite a while.

488
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:21,681
I guess we can start doing questions.

489
00:26:22,402 --> 00:26:24,403
I know there is a lot in chat, but for people

490
00:26:24,503 --> 00:26:27,804
who are attending in the audience, I don't know if.

491
00:26:28,985 --> 00:26:31,466
Maybe I'll answer a question in chat while the audience can.

492
00:26:33,274 --> 00:26:36,591
Okay, questions? Let's see.

493
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,141
How does marketing on TikTok differ from other social media systems?

494
00:26:42,221 --> 00:26:45,942
Is there anything you found that's significantly easier or harder on different platforms?

495
00:26:46,242 --> 00:26:47,422
That's a very big question.

496
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:51,723
I think a lot of social media platforms, if you're talking about marketing,

497
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,824
if you're talking about like paid marketing or something, that could be very different.

498
00:26:57,865 --> 00:27:02,466
As with anything, I think with TikTok, the thing that a lot of people struggle with

499
00:27:02,526 --> 00:27:05,707
is just how organic TikTok needs to feel sometimes.

500
00:27:07,891 --> 00:27:12,295
And especially when you're if you're making like a sponsored or an ad on TikTok,

501
00:27:12,315 --> 00:27:17,679
a lot of the time, like you will automatically scroll through it if you can see that it's a clear brand.

502
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:23,744
But if it's like someone who's like a little more, I've seen people like use like influencers on TikTok,

503
00:27:23,764 --> 00:27:27,887
like just like kind of talk about a product more organically, but still have the ad thing.

504
00:27:28,548 --> 00:27:32,050
That's something I think is one of the things that people are struggling with.

505
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:33,331
I hope that was your question.

506
00:27:35,877 --> 00:27:37,767
Do we have questions from the audience?

507
00:27:39,032 --> 00:27:39,792
in person?

508
00:27:40,153 --> 00:27:40,413
Hello.

509
00:27:40,553 --> 00:27:41,194
Oh yes, hello.

510
00:27:41,254 --> 00:27:41,414
Hi.

511
00:27:41,634 --> 00:27:41,954
Hello.

512
00:27:42,235 --> 00:27:42,595
Hello.

513
00:27:42,715 --> 00:27:46,058
I'm a huge fan and yes, so this is kind of a two part question.

514
00:27:46,398 --> 00:27:50,162
We were actually both finalists last year in the GameHers for Best Community Manager

515
00:27:50,242 --> 00:27:52,504
Indie so I would love to be your friend if possible.

516
00:27:53,665 --> 00:27:58,509
And also, what do you do if something is failing and the studio is freaking out?

517
00:27:59,090 --> 00:28:00,591
How do you pivot or react to that?

518
00:28:00,831 --> 00:28:05,676
Is there kind of a panic plan or do you have any tips or advice for something like that?

519
00:28:06,958 --> 00:28:08,399
When something is failing.

520
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:10,920
Like let's say on social you kind of have a,

521
00:28:12,001 --> 00:28:13,502
not the reaction you were hoping for.

522
00:28:13,562 --> 00:28:16,063
Maybe you've done kind of a troll post or a meme post

523
00:28:16,183 --> 00:28:18,024
and it's kind of getting maybe canceled

524
00:28:18,064 --> 00:28:19,825
or something like that, kind of the worst possible.

525
00:28:19,845 --> 00:28:21,766
And you're getting a lot of really negative,

526
00:28:21,906 --> 00:28:22,647
negative response.

527
00:28:22,707 --> 00:28:24,348
Do you have any tips for that on TikTok

528
00:28:24,428 --> 00:28:25,688
or really any socials?

529
00:28:26,791 --> 00:28:31,216
Yeah, so I hesitate to kind of give super blanket response answers to this,

530
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,539
because I'm like, what are you? What did you post?

531
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,102
Right. So it's right.

532
00:28:36,142 --> 00:28:39,526
So it's one of those things where it's like, well, I mean, there's only so much

533
00:28:39,586 --> 00:28:43,751
firefighting you can do depending on how severe the community thinks it is.

534
00:28:43,791 --> 00:28:45,293
Like if you made like.

535
00:28:46,234 --> 00:28:52,537
a joke and they're like a silence brand because I don't know, it was a really old meme and whatever,

536
00:28:52,657 --> 00:28:58,560
then it's one of those things where you can just move on from it. Like again, people's attention

537
00:28:58,621 --> 00:29:07,265
spans and remembering of things super fast. I would just keep posting. Maybe, I don't know what

538
00:29:07,285 --> 00:29:13,188
it is, feel free to DM me on Twitter, I don't know what's happening. But I would say when it comes to,

539
00:29:13,709 --> 00:29:14,049
it's just.

540
00:29:15,213 --> 00:29:20,877
being honest with whatever your studio and understanding that sometimes things don't

541
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:24,700
take up well with the community or at least like responding to the comments in there and being like

542
00:29:24,981 --> 00:29:28,984
you know what you're right that wasn't the greatest joke we could have made

543
00:29:29,584 --> 00:29:32,607
gonna fix it or I don't know again I don't know what happened.

544
00:29:34,308 --> 00:29:39,190
But I would say like really taking note of what the community is saying and making an effort to

545
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:44,332
like respond, engage with it. Like I took like almost like a day just going through comment,

546
00:29:44,392 --> 00:29:48,933
dead game comments and responding to it. So hopefully that helps.

547
00:29:49,974 --> 00:29:51,214
Thank you so much and thank you for being here.

548
00:29:52,109 --> 00:29:53,070
Yeah, no, thank you.

549
00:29:54,510 --> 00:29:57,532
OK, I will switch to a chat question.

550
00:29:58,813 --> 00:30:00,554
Is there an ideal video length that you

551
00:30:00,614 --> 00:30:02,014
found drove the most engagement?

552
00:30:02,095 --> 00:30:04,096
Yes, under 15 seconds, always.

553
00:30:04,616 --> 00:30:09,899
Well, OK, most engagement, no, because as the graph kind

554
00:30:09,939 --> 00:30:12,800
of showed, it honestly was pretty consistent.

555
00:30:13,621 --> 00:30:16,883
If you want the views, though, then under 15 seconds.

556
00:30:18,764 --> 00:30:19,004
All right.

557
00:30:20,464 --> 00:30:21,685
In-person question.

558
00:30:22,450 --> 00:30:23,491
Hey, Victoria, it's Jared.

559
00:30:23,511 --> 00:30:24,111
Ooh, it's hot.

560
00:30:24,171 --> 00:30:25,972
Oh, hey!

561
00:30:26,372 --> 00:30:28,132
Yeah, thanks for always being willing to share

562
00:30:28,192 --> 00:30:29,033
everything that you've learned

563
00:30:29,073 --> 00:30:30,673
from all of these games that you've worked on.

564
00:30:30,693 --> 00:30:34,314
I was wondering, for discoverability of a game

565
00:30:34,414 --> 00:30:36,755
that, let's say, is relatively unknown,

566
00:30:36,795 --> 00:30:38,976
like you did with Boyfriend Dungeon or Unpacking,

567
00:30:39,376 --> 00:30:43,958
what would be one big point that you'd give advice

568
00:30:44,018 --> 00:30:47,019
for discoverability of a relatively unknown game on TikTok?

569
00:30:48,199 --> 00:30:50,440
Yeah, so, okay, oh God, one.

570
00:30:52,571 --> 00:30:53,953
It's okay, so it's a mixture of things.

571
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:56,736
The biggest thing is always just like the hook

572
00:30:57,517 --> 00:30:59,540
of your TikTok content.

573
00:30:59,660 --> 00:31:04,906
So the first video that ever blew up on Kit Fox Games

574
00:31:05,006 --> 00:31:06,168
when I was working on it,

575
00:31:06,288 --> 00:31:08,390
that like got like the first like,

576
00:31:09,111 --> 00:31:11,214
the first video I had like maybe like over 100,000 views.

577
00:31:12,815 --> 00:31:17,556
views in, or maybe over 10,000 views, and it's been a long time, sorry, I'm stalling,

578
00:31:18,436 --> 00:31:24,818
is one where I was basically talking about dating your weapons or something. It was just

579
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:30,359
something that was kind of, if you heard it for the first time, you were like, wait, what?

580
00:31:31,420 --> 00:31:32,660
So having people really

581
00:31:34,668 --> 00:31:39,571
have like a wait what moment is usually quite helpful when it comes to like discoverability.

582
00:31:40,652 --> 00:31:44,654
Like the weird like so if you go on TikTok there's like a weirdness to it there's like a little bit

583
00:31:44,674 --> 00:31:51,038
of a chaos to it and that really is something that hooks on quite a bit and when it comes to

584
00:31:51,139 --> 00:31:56,762
unpacking oh I also sorry I also meant to say having like three to five hashtags usually pretty

585
00:31:56,782 --> 00:31:59,224
good um please make it relevant but.

586
00:32:00,254 --> 00:32:05,057
some people like just look at the hashtags other game studios are using and kind of learn from that.

587
00:32:06,277 --> 00:32:11,561
And for unpacking the first one that kind of went viral was honestly just talking about the joy of

588
00:32:11,681 --> 00:32:18,265
I think talking about organization because so many people love organizing things. Like TikTok

589
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:24,569
has like organization TikTok, there's book talk, there is game talk, there are so many like sub

590
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:30,841
TikTok genres is that really honing in onto one genre that you like, you really want people to

591
00:32:30,901 --> 00:32:34,904
discover is usually the way to get more discoverability.

592
00:32:37,746 --> 00:32:43,390
Oh, okay. We're over time, but oh no. Okay. I was gonna say,

593
00:32:43,430 --> 00:32:45,292
but they didn't tell me to wrap up yet, but they totally did.

594
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:47,960
I just ignored it, sorry.

595
00:32:49,040 --> 00:32:50,160
Thank you for being here.

596
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,181
If you have any more questions, and I

597
00:32:52,221 --> 00:32:53,461
know there are a lot of questions in chat

598
00:32:53,522 --> 00:32:55,622
and I'm sure in person, please feel

599
00:32:55,682 --> 00:32:57,843
free to message me on Twitter.

600
00:32:57,863 --> 00:32:59,684
It might take me a little bit to get to it,

601
00:32:59,724 --> 00:33:00,864
but I will try to get to it.

602
00:33:00,984 --> 00:33:04,265
Or just tweet at me so other people can see the question

603
00:33:04,305 --> 00:33:04,565
too.

604
00:33:05,406 --> 00:33:06,966
Yeah, thank you so much for being here.

605
00:33:07,086 --> 00:33:08,187
I hope it was helpful.

606
00:33:08,827 --> 00:33:10,308
And have a good GDC.

607
00:33:10,348 --> 00:33:11,888
Stay safe if you're out there.

608
00:33:12,888 --> 00:33:14,289
OK, bye.
