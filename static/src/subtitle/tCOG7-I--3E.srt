1
00:00:11,592 --> 00:00:12,613
How's everybody doing today?

2
00:00:12,633 --> 00:00:15,895
Good, good.

3
00:00:17,136 --> 00:00:20,279
It's after two o'clock, so I'm sure you guys are getting nice and sleepy.

4
00:00:20,399 --> 00:00:23,841
So I'm hoping that I can keep you up and excited for the rest of this talk.

5
00:00:25,222 --> 00:00:29,826
But before we begin, I have some housekeeping to cover and we'll get right into it.

6
00:00:31,512 --> 00:00:35,374
Similar to the game, this talk also has a mental health advisory.

7
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:43,617
We will be covering serious topics of addiction, PTSD, panic attacks, anxiety, and delusions.

8
00:00:44,818 --> 00:00:48,979
People may experience fear of dentistry, tight spaces, or vomit.

9
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,322
And we approach these topics with light-headed manner, and it may be distressing, but we

10
00:00:54,342 --> 00:00:56,262
always try to approach these topics with empathy.

11
00:00:57,703 --> 00:00:58,823
So let's begin.

12
00:01:01,095 --> 00:01:05,058
So welcome to the talk of the art direction of Psychonauts 2.

13
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,441
Today we'll start with some intros, I'll tell you who I am,

14
00:01:08,882 --> 00:01:09,843
and some ground rules,

15
00:01:09,883 --> 00:01:12,125
and then we'll begin our psychedelic journey.

16
00:01:13,306 --> 00:01:14,627
This is not a technical talk.

17
00:01:15,148 --> 00:01:17,430
It's about the creative journey that our team and I went on

18
00:01:17,630 --> 00:01:20,573
in order to create the game that you have gotten to enjoy.

19
00:01:20,593 --> 00:01:20,653
And...

20
00:01:22,574 --> 00:01:26,777
This is also a dedication to the work the team and I did.

21
00:01:26,857 --> 00:01:29,999
So feel free to ask questions at the end, and we'll get

22
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:31,680
into a little bit of that later.

23
00:01:33,361 --> 00:01:34,882
So I'll introduce myself really quickly.

24
00:01:35,342 --> 00:01:37,004
My name is Lissette DeJu Montgomery.

25
00:01:37,024 --> 00:01:39,785
I have been an art director in the game industry for...

26
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:42,688
I've been doing this for 21 years.

27
00:01:42,748 --> 00:01:44,389
I've been in leadership for over 10.

28
00:01:45,530 --> 00:01:47,291
I've worked at studios large and small,

29
00:01:47,551 --> 00:01:49,572
large studios like EA and Ubisoft,

30
00:01:50,533 --> 00:01:53,755
and small studios like Backbone and now Double Fine.

31
00:01:54,435 --> 00:01:57,657
I've worked on 14 different engines across multiple genres.

32
00:01:58,658 --> 00:02:00,239
Here's some of the ship titles that I made.

33
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:03,661
Psychonauts 2 is also, of course, my why you're all here,

34
00:02:04,261 --> 00:02:06,202
but I've been making games for quite some time.

35
00:02:07,647 --> 00:02:09,968
In addition to making games for the last 20 years,

36
00:02:10,008 --> 00:02:11,908
I've also been an instructor at Gameheads.

37
00:02:12,008 --> 00:02:13,649
I see a few of my students here.

38
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,570
Thank you.

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:18,791
And so I'm very experienced at being in the classroom.

40
00:02:19,231 --> 00:02:20,292
And so I have a few rules.

41
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:23,393
First rule is no cell phones or phone discussions

42
00:02:23,493 --> 00:02:24,253
during the talk.

43
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:27,435
I will have the talking turtle until QA.

44
00:02:28,575 --> 00:02:30,116
Please hold questions until the end.

45
00:02:31,176 --> 00:02:33,117
And there will be maybe a pop quiz.

46
00:02:34,934 --> 00:02:38,858
And the third and most important rule is that we're all here to learn and to have fun.

47
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:44,443
So I will start with one of the most common questions that we got during development.

48
00:02:45,304 --> 00:02:47,366
Why are you taking so long?

49
00:02:54,005 --> 00:02:59,507
So why did Psychonauts 2 take so long? Well, there's a list of reasons and it kind of reads

50
00:02:59,527 --> 00:03:05,910
like a Christmas song. 16 years after the first game, 13 unique brain levels that all needed

51
00:03:05,950 --> 00:03:12,492
their own art direction, 10 years of planning, 7 years of development, 5 and a half hours of

52
00:03:12,552 --> 00:03:18,094
cutscenes, 3 missed deadlines to publishers, and a fake campaign.

53
00:03:18,791 --> 00:03:22,215
So the real reason why, however, is

54
00:03:22,235 --> 00:03:25,098
that our initial production processes and our art direction

55
00:03:25,138 --> 00:03:28,422
processes did not work for the game we were actually making.

56
00:03:31,792 --> 00:03:35,553
So just a quick recap of where the game was when I started.

57
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,773
The campaign happened in 2015

58
00:03:37,893 --> 00:03:41,534
and pre-production started shortly after.

59
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,995
And I joined Double Fine in August of 2017.

60
00:03:45,095 --> 00:03:47,016
So that meant that the game didn't really

61
00:03:47,056 --> 00:03:49,096
have a dedicated art director for the first two years.

62
00:03:50,263 --> 00:03:53,606
The team had also just completed their first vertical slice or playable level.

63
00:03:53,626 --> 00:03:59,530
And everyone felt like it was close, but it wasn't quite as psychonautical as we wanted it to be.

64
00:04:00,371 --> 00:04:01,932
And I'll explain the term psychonautical.

65
00:04:02,833 --> 00:04:11,899
It's a term that we use on the team to describe whether the game itself was close and felt true to the first game and what we were trying to do in this game.

66
00:04:11,919 --> 00:04:15,082
So if something didn't feel quite right, we would say it's not psychonautical.

67
00:04:15,202 --> 00:04:17,643
Or if something was really cool and trippy, we would say that.

68
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:27,747
So one of the biggest challenges I noticed at the time was that the leadership who was

69
00:04:27,807 --> 00:04:30,729
in place created a big studio structure.

70
00:04:30,749 --> 00:04:36,955
The lead designer had come from a really large studio and he was used to these siloed departments

71
00:04:37,335 --> 00:04:40,398
and sort of how content moved through those departments in that way.

72
00:04:42,053 --> 00:04:47,779
which is great for a large studio and that sort of structure works when you're having teams of three or four hundred people,

73
00:04:48,319 --> 00:04:55,106
but not necessarily so well when you're dealing with a team of maybe thirty or forty artists and twenty designers.

74
00:04:55,166 --> 00:04:59,430
So there's just not, there just isn't the kind of structure that works with a small team.

75
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:05,049
So this is an example of what the structure was like when I began.

76
00:05:05,069 --> 00:05:08,692
Essentially everyone is reporting to the lead designers.

77
00:05:09,192 --> 00:05:13,315
Below that are directors like myself where we are approving features

78
00:05:13,995 --> 00:05:16,097
and working with the lead designer on how things work.

79
00:05:16,737 --> 00:05:23,221
Below that are the art leads, so they are the technical and craftsmanship mentors that work with our implementers.

80
00:05:24,181 --> 00:05:26,843
And the people who actually do the work are all the way at the bottom.

81
00:05:27,323 --> 00:05:32,006
So you can see that everyone at the bottom is just reacting to decisions, but they're not necessarily participating in it.

82
00:05:32,486 --> 00:05:34,767
And then decisions all have to be funded through the LD.

83
00:05:35,148 --> 00:05:37,689
So that was just creating a lot of confusion and tension.

84
00:05:37,889 --> 00:05:42,171
Once again, this process works great when you're at a big studio. It doesn't work so great when you're at a small studio.

85
00:05:43,987 --> 00:05:47,530
And this is an example of what the vertical slice looked like when I began.

86
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:50,192
And it's a really great start.

87
00:05:50,232 --> 00:05:54,215
When you look at it, it feels close to being psychonautical,

88
00:05:54,936 --> 00:05:56,897
but there's also a lot of visual challenges.

89
00:05:58,676 --> 00:06:01,337
First thing is that the team is having a really hard time

90
00:06:01,777 --> 00:06:03,578
figuring out how to make it easy for the player

91
00:06:03,598 --> 00:06:05,499
to understand where to go and how to navigate.

92
00:06:06,839 --> 00:06:08,340
Landmarks were hard to distinguish.

93
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:11,041
The shape language wasn't as clear.

94
00:06:11,581 --> 00:06:14,242
And I think the worst culprit was the back wall.

95
00:06:14,262 --> 00:06:15,943
If you literally notice the back wall.

96
00:06:17,224 --> 00:06:18,565
And there's a static shot of that.

97
00:06:19,085 --> 00:06:21,207
There's a lot of repeating, repetitive shapes.

98
00:06:21,267 --> 00:06:23,088
And that was just creating a wall of noise

99
00:06:23,128 --> 00:06:24,429
and was making it hard for the player

100
00:06:24,449 --> 00:06:25,410
to know what was important.

101
00:06:26,811 --> 00:06:28,973
And the culprit, and the main culprit for this,

102
00:06:28,993 --> 00:06:30,374
was our level design process.

103
00:06:31,014 --> 00:06:33,997
As I mentioned before, we had big studio processes.

104
00:06:34,457 --> 00:06:37,980
So every content would go through design and white box.

105
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:39,621
Then it would go to art to update.

106
00:06:40,121 --> 00:06:43,144
Then it would go through the pipeline to VFX and foliage.

107
00:06:43,804 --> 00:06:43,984
So.

108
00:06:45,226 --> 00:06:47,689
that wasn't really necessarily working extremely well.

109
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:49,732
And you kind of see that here.

110
00:06:49,752 --> 00:06:53,036
The kit process we were using in order to save on costs,

111
00:06:53,597 --> 00:06:55,540
which is essentially reusing a lot of assets

112
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:56,981
because we had such a small team,

113
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:59,405
was also leading to this visual noise

114
00:06:59,485 --> 00:07:02,389
and lack of identifiable landmarks.

115
00:07:03,992 --> 00:07:07,395
In addition to that, we just needed a new way to work together.

116
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:09,957
A lot of the team was just frustrated.

117
00:07:10,337 --> 00:07:13,880
The silos, departments were not communicating well.

118
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:19,445
People were not quite sure why decisions were made and where they were coming from, and

119
00:07:19,465 --> 00:07:21,547
that's because they were all being funneled up through the top.

120
00:07:23,829 --> 00:07:28,151
So over Christmas break, I kind of really quickly realized

121
00:07:28,191 --> 00:07:30,052
we needed a new way to restructure the team

122
00:07:30,112 --> 00:07:31,833
if this was going to work

123
00:07:31,873 --> 00:07:33,634
and we were gonna be able to ship Psychonauts 2.

124
00:07:34,375 --> 00:07:37,056
And I really focused on the feedback

125
00:07:37,076 --> 00:07:40,338
that I got from the team over the months after I started

126
00:07:40,918 --> 00:07:42,759
and what they were mostly frustrated about.

127
00:07:43,419 --> 00:07:44,880
And what they were mostly frustrated about

128
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,721
was a lack of ownership.

129
00:07:46,061 --> 00:07:47,201
They felt like they were just reacting

130
00:07:47,241 --> 00:07:48,382
to things coming from departments,

131
00:07:48,402 --> 00:07:49,963
but they had no say in the work

132
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:50,863
that they actually had to do.

133
00:07:52,572 --> 00:07:55,814
So I rallied a team, a small team of leads

134
00:07:55,935 --> 00:07:59,738
to sequester a small team to try out a new process.

135
00:08:00,258 --> 00:08:01,900
And this is a reflection of that process.

136
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:04,682
So what you're seeing is a core team that's driving ideas,

137
00:08:04,722 --> 00:08:06,243
and these are the people who actually do the work

138
00:08:06,464 --> 00:08:07,124
here in the center.

139
00:08:07,865 --> 00:08:09,906
And then you have directors over.

140
00:08:11,228 --> 00:08:13,751
to the lower left providing support.

141
00:08:14,392 --> 00:08:17,335
And also support team members who are our technical experts

142
00:08:17,616 --> 00:08:19,558
who are additionally providing support.

143
00:08:19,899 --> 00:08:21,841
So everybody's there to support the strike team

144
00:08:21,861 --> 00:08:22,662
and not vice versa.

145
00:08:27,472 --> 00:08:31,036
The next thing I did to kind of get the team to work better together is start having more

146
00:08:31,116 --> 00:08:32,697
forms of structured meetings in play.

147
00:08:33,698 --> 00:08:37,242
I won't get into the rules of IDEO play and story, but this is an excellent framework

148
00:08:37,282 --> 00:08:43,708
for putting a team together in order to quickly ideate on ideas.

149
00:08:43,728 --> 00:08:48,092
And I won't get into all of the rules, but the most important thing is the yes and.

150
00:08:48,472 --> 00:08:49,693
When you're in the middle of a brainstorm,

151
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:51,613
the yes and rule is probably the most important.

152
00:08:52,153 --> 00:08:53,634
It also stops the negative Nancys

153
00:08:53,674 --> 00:08:55,195
from dominating the conversation.

154
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:57,635
And it focuses the team on the best ideas

155
00:08:57,755 --> 00:08:59,276
and having them expand on them together.

156
00:09:01,697 --> 00:09:04,958
I also learned a lot of other design thinking methodologies

157
00:09:04,978 --> 00:09:05,778
that I use in my team.

158
00:09:05,838 --> 00:09:07,359
I'll cover some of those later.

159
00:09:07,899 --> 00:09:10,540
But a lot of that I learned from leading for creativity

160
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,980
a course at IDEO.

161
00:09:12,461 --> 00:09:14,501
And with all the leadership challenges we have,

162
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:17,242
I think any resources we can find are great to share.

163
00:09:20,109 --> 00:09:23,151
So, what you're now looking at is the final result

164
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:24,552
of changing that process.

165
00:09:24,592 --> 00:09:26,813
This is what the quarry looks like in the shipping game.

166
00:09:30,163 --> 00:09:32,625
this wouldn't have been possible without restructuring the team.

167
00:09:33,045 --> 00:09:35,327
And trust me, this is the last of the processy stuff.

168
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:38,089
But what you played in the game today

169
00:09:38,149 --> 00:09:40,030
would not be possible without this change.

170
00:09:40,070 --> 00:09:41,872
And I think it's important for people who are art directors

171
00:09:41,912 --> 00:09:44,814
and leaders to understand you have to structure your team

172
00:09:44,854 --> 00:09:47,496
around how your team works and the culture of your studio,

173
00:09:47,936 --> 00:09:50,278
and not necessarily what may have worked at a larger studio

174
00:09:50,679 --> 00:09:51,899
or what worked at what you did before.

175
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:57,184
So what's also extremely the most important is transferring ownership to your implementers

176
00:09:58,145 --> 00:10:01,948
and also making sure that you're there for them and providing proper support.

177
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:08,975
And it's also, and the most vital, is trying to change your team culture so that the people with

178
00:10:09,095 --> 00:10:14,880
the best ideas aren't coming from the loudest people in the room. And I think that was one

179
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:16,041
of the challenges that we were also having.

180
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,053
So with this new process and a new way to work

181
00:10:20,833 --> 00:10:23,254
and some proven results, we needed

182
00:10:23,274 --> 00:10:25,675
to start on rebooting the rest of the game.

183
00:10:28,656 --> 00:10:30,517
And we started with Lobato's Labyrinth.

184
00:10:32,538 --> 00:10:35,459
So we knew we were probably getting closer

185
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,380
to being able to make the game we want,

186
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:39,721
but we needed to actually finish an entire level.

187
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:44,591
And we also knew that E3 2019 was coming up fast.

188
00:10:45,151 --> 00:10:47,232
And marketing and our partners wanted

189
00:10:47,252 --> 00:10:49,473
to have a playable demo on site.

190
00:10:50,393 --> 00:10:52,694
So we had less than three months to make a demo.

191
00:10:52,754 --> 00:10:55,155
We had a new process that we just kind of started

192
00:10:55,195 --> 00:10:55,775
figuring out.

193
00:10:56,555 --> 00:10:58,576
And we needed to figure out how we

194
00:10:58,596 --> 00:11:01,557
were going to get to E3 while we were running out of time.

195
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:07,659
So I'll do a quick update of what Bottles' level is like,

196
00:11:07,679 --> 00:11:09,700
so you understand what you're watching, because our game is

197
00:11:09,720 --> 00:11:10,200
a little weird.

198
00:11:12,589 --> 00:11:17,731
So Lobato's level is, starts in a mundane office building.

199
00:11:18,712 --> 00:11:22,433
And the mission starts with Razz, Lily, Sasha, Mia,

200
00:11:22,493 --> 00:11:25,795
and Coach on a mission to figure out who Dr. Lobato is.

201
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:28,556
Or Dr. Lobato's boss is.

202
00:11:30,077 --> 00:11:33,178
So they've created this construct of a mundane office

203
00:11:33,498 --> 00:11:36,719
in order to trick Dr. Lobato into signing a vacation form

204
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,860
for winning an employee of the year award.

205
00:11:40,415 --> 00:11:45,041
But Dr. Lobato quickly realizes that there is a trick going on in his mind and begins

206
00:11:45,081 --> 00:11:46,282
to set traps.

207
00:11:47,464 --> 00:11:52,090
And so this mundane office building turns into a disgusting dental hell that you have

208
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,392
to try to escape.

209
00:11:56,256 --> 00:11:56,937
No spoilers there.

210
00:11:58,298 --> 00:12:01,439
So, we quickly got to brainstorming with our new process.

211
00:12:02,099 --> 00:12:05,060
And one of the things that I would like to do with my teams

212
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,221
when we're first starting on levels

213
00:12:06,281 --> 00:12:08,661
is coming up some brainstorms and doing some target art.

214
00:12:09,001 --> 00:12:10,742
And the target art are just pieces that kind of say,

215
00:12:10,762 --> 00:12:12,203
this is the weird experience we can have,

216
00:12:12,543 --> 00:12:13,583
but it's not tied to anything

217
00:12:13,603 --> 00:12:14,663
we're actually going to be doing.

218
00:12:15,003 --> 00:12:16,444
This is just a vision setting piece.

219
00:12:17,498 --> 00:12:20,840
So our really talented artist, Gigi,

220
00:12:21,060 --> 00:12:22,661
I'll just use her real nickname,

221
00:12:23,421 --> 00:12:27,062
created these really talented, fully formed visions

222
00:12:27,122 --> 00:12:29,683
of what some of the weird things and spaces we could do

223
00:12:29,723 --> 00:12:33,885
with this weird concept of office building and dental hell.

224
00:12:34,385 --> 00:12:36,386
So these images really kind of told us

225
00:12:36,426 --> 00:12:38,027
we were on a right journey and a path

226
00:12:38,487 --> 00:12:40,068
of what we could do with some of these spaces.

227
00:12:41,068 --> 00:12:43,249
And we were able to verify that really quickly

228
00:12:43,609 --> 00:12:45,190
with some brainstorms and exercises.

229
00:12:48,475 --> 00:12:52,516
In addition to working out the general theme of the level,

230
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:54,837
we started to dig into what you were actually doing.

231
00:12:55,097 --> 00:12:59,298
So we knew that the Lobato level and the E3 2019 demo

232
00:12:59,638 --> 00:13:01,779
were also going to be our tutorial level.

233
00:13:02,319 --> 00:13:02,999
And at this point,

234
00:13:03,039 --> 00:13:05,640
because we had two years of development under our belt,

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,401
most of our powers were somewhat figured out,

236
00:13:08,461 --> 00:13:09,221
but not refined.

237
00:13:09,561 --> 00:13:10,982
So we knew what you were going to be doing

238
00:13:11,002 --> 00:13:11,902
at the beginning of the game

239
00:13:12,322 --> 00:13:14,363
and what power set Raz was going to have.

240
00:13:14,603 --> 00:13:15,883
So we needed to think about

241
00:13:16,324 --> 00:13:18,285
ways to use those powers in unique ways,

242
00:13:18,805 --> 00:13:22,408
and to create some danger rooms for power learning and tutorials.

243
00:13:25,089 --> 00:13:29,472
So, because of the weird concepts in our game,

244
00:13:30,213 --> 00:13:32,895
we had to really think about how we can identify

245
00:13:32,935 --> 00:13:36,217
what is TKable, what is powerable,

246
00:13:36,317 --> 00:13:37,698
what can you use your powers on,

247
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:39,919
because every single level looks different,

248
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:42,481
and what is a proper hazard

249
00:13:42,521 --> 00:13:44,562
is going to be a completely different object in the next brain.

250
00:13:45,643 --> 00:13:51,907
So we use these concepts to illustrate how we can use Raz's powers within spatial concepts.

251
00:13:52,308 --> 00:13:56,651
So you see some of these really great ideas that came through the final game,

252
00:13:56,731 --> 00:14:00,274
particularly, you know, the TK puzzle, which I'll get into a little bit later.

253
00:14:01,134 --> 00:14:08,537
And then the Sy Blast room, that long walk up the executive table came directly from this really

254
00:14:08,577 --> 00:14:13,899
quick, you know, thumbnail. And so you're starting to see how the integration of design and art

255
00:14:13,939 --> 00:14:17,080
really started to shape the gameplay spaces that we were creating.

256
00:14:19,569 --> 00:14:21,430
Another great way we helped support design

257
00:14:21,550 --> 00:14:25,130
was to do quick mock-ups of what puzzle spaces could look like.

258
00:14:25,170 --> 00:14:28,851
I think one of the most challenging things about spatial design with puzzles

259
00:14:29,171 --> 00:14:31,952
is figuring out what the solution is and not just that,

260
00:14:32,292 --> 00:14:35,093
figuring out the various things a player may not or do wrong

261
00:14:35,113 --> 00:14:36,453
in order to find that solution.

262
00:14:36,993 --> 00:14:41,814
So we use a lot of really quick sketches in order to visual problem-solve

263
00:14:41,854 --> 00:14:44,515
that didn't require us to constantly change our environment art

264
00:14:44,535 --> 00:14:45,775
to react to those changes.

265
00:14:49,524 --> 00:14:53,732
This is an example of us helping problem-solve the final result of

266
00:14:53,852 --> 00:14:54,895
Coach's TK puzzle.

267
00:14:54,935 --> 00:14:59,644
Finally! Great job following orders. Private, you go on ahead. I'll take up the rear guy.

268
00:15:02,333 --> 00:15:05,655
So what we ended up having with these new processes

269
00:15:05,695 --> 00:15:11,478
and this new way to work was a really strong final result.

270
00:15:12,339 --> 00:15:14,380
Lobata was our first level that we rebooted

271
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:17,881
and the E3 demo just had an amazing result.

272
00:15:17,901 --> 00:15:19,482
We got a lot of awards and a lot of press.

273
00:15:19,982 --> 00:15:22,424
And so we knew that what we were doing was right

274
00:15:22,964 --> 00:15:26,766
and we had to now go back and redo a good chunk of the game.

275
00:15:30,585 --> 00:15:31,546
All of this work was worth it.

276
00:15:32,326 --> 00:15:33,287
There were some downsides.

277
00:15:34,147 --> 00:15:35,688
The art was a bit more bespoke,

278
00:15:35,928 --> 00:15:36,949
cost a little bit more time,

279
00:15:39,010 --> 00:15:40,731
but it paid off in overall improvements

280
00:15:41,351 --> 00:15:44,192
and team morale finally started to increase.

281
00:15:48,475 --> 00:15:51,116
So now let's fast forward to one of the last levels

282
00:15:51,156 --> 00:15:52,757
we worked on, which is Bob's Bottles.

283
00:15:54,138 --> 00:15:55,638
I think it's one of the last ones we worked on

284
00:15:55,658 --> 00:15:58,060
because it was the hardest subject matter we had to cover.

285
00:15:59,540 --> 00:16:01,357
and the subject matter was alcohol addiction.

286
00:16:03,591 --> 00:16:07,412
Our main subject, Bob Zanotto, we find him in a very sad state,

287
00:16:07,752 --> 00:16:08,772
and we had to explain why.

288
00:16:08,792 --> 00:16:12,154
And this is not the type of thing you want

289
00:16:12,174 --> 00:16:14,935
to actually experience sometimes when you're playing a game.

290
00:16:14,955 --> 00:16:16,555
It's usually escapism.

291
00:16:17,055 --> 00:16:20,557
But this story was so central to what happened to the psychonauts

292
00:16:20,897 --> 00:16:23,117
in this game that we had to explore it.

293
00:16:23,898 --> 00:16:27,479
It also was central to why Bob's mental words were so sad.

294
00:16:27,979 --> 00:16:29,620
So there was really no way around it.

295
00:16:33,816 --> 00:16:36,962
So, a quick synopsis of what happens in Bob's bottles.

296
00:16:38,063 --> 00:16:42,130
You essentially start finding Bob inside of a greenhouse,

297
00:16:43,012 --> 00:16:44,915
and he's essentially drinking himself

298
00:16:45,216 --> 00:16:46,358
and feeding his plants.

299
00:16:47,259 --> 00:16:49,140
And when he answers, he doesn't want you there,

300
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:51,722
but the plants quickly realize that you dare to help him,

301
00:16:51,743 --> 00:16:53,184
and they help you enter his brain.

302
00:16:53,764 --> 00:16:54,805
And once you're inside of his mind,

303
00:16:54,825 --> 00:16:58,488
you find him on a tiny island, kind of isolated and by himself.

304
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,991
And he knows that there's these memories out in the world

305
00:17:02,031 --> 00:17:04,133
that he needs to collect, that he's cast off

306
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:05,794
in order to help himself.

307
00:17:05,954 --> 00:17:08,797
So you and Bob go on a mission in order

308
00:17:08,817 --> 00:17:13,060
to find these memory seeds and to help heal Bob's pain.

309
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:17,599
So our first bottle we had to tackle was Tia's bottle.

310
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:19,663
And Tia is Bob's mom.

311
00:17:20,665 --> 00:17:23,631
And so we needed a way to tell Bob's story about his mother

312
00:17:23,691 --> 00:17:25,976
because it's sort of the origin story of where

313
00:17:25,996 --> 00:17:26,958
his addiction came from.

314
00:17:31,468 --> 00:17:35,670
So our first explorations were really focused on the theme of alcohol.

315
00:17:35,750 --> 00:17:40,652
So there's a lot of bottles and tropical drinks and champagne, fountains.

316
00:17:41,413 --> 00:17:44,014
And some of the stuff actually worked and landed.

317
00:17:44,234 --> 00:17:48,616
And then some of it felt a little, I don't know, too celebratory.

318
00:17:50,536 --> 00:17:53,658
So we really started to explore what this world could look like,

319
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:55,359
but trying to figure out our way.

320
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:58,960
So this is an example of one of our first prototypes.

321
00:18:01,163 --> 00:18:03,464
This is an environment level by Jeremy French.

322
00:18:03,524 --> 00:18:05,525
She's one of our talented environment artists.

323
00:18:06,165 --> 00:18:07,986
And you're also seeing the first expressions

324
00:18:08,026 --> 00:18:09,427
of what Bob's bottles looks like.

325
00:18:09,567 --> 00:18:11,028
You see the water bubble,

326
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,328
which is one of the main mechanics

327
00:18:12,348 --> 00:18:14,950
that we use to kind of move Raz

328
00:18:15,090 --> 00:18:19,652
and keep him dry in this very alcohol-soaked space.

329
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:24,636
You're also seeing these floating bottles, like the alcohol elements are really obvious,

330
00:18:24,997 --> 00:18:30,301
the primitives are alcohol themed, the platforms are floating orange slices,

331
00:18:30,381 --> 00:18:36,547
so you get that there's a there there, but it just isn't really reflecting what is happening to Bob.

332
00:18:38,871 --> 00:18:42,897
In addition, it just felt like the kit process here, again, was just not working.

333
00:18:44,138 --> 00:18:48,705
And then on top of that, it just didn't feel like we were being reverent

334
00:18:48,745 --> 00:18:50,367
to what was happening to Bob.

335
00:18:50,407 --> 00:18:51,549
This is a serious topic.

336
00:18:51,969 --> 00:18:54,533
And it just felt like we were kind of brushing over it.

337
00:18:57,648 --> 00:19:04,093
So before I get into that, so we struggled with Bob for a little bit, and then I had

338
00:19:04,173 --> 00:19:06,695
kind of an epiphany moment while I was out dancing.

339
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:12,740
It's a thing that I do to kind of disconnect and reconnect to my soul, and the lyrics to

340
00:19:12,780 --> 00:19:16,543
the song hit me, and that was when I kind of knew what we needed to do.

341
00:19:16,983 --> 00:19:20,806
So I'll let the lyrics play, and we won't listen to the whole song.

342
00:19:29,424 --> 00:19:29,625
You

343
00:19:34,095 --> 00:19:35,115
This is the explicit version.

344
00:20:04,002 --> 00:20:11,092
Soon that I'm gonna get my cup. I see the crowd changing by the minute and the record took a sip

345
00:20:11,112 --> 00:20:20,505
then another sip. Then somebody said to me, so the thing about this song that really struck me.

346
00:20:21,397 --> 00:20:23,737
was that it sounds like a club banger.

347
00:20:23,938 --> 00:20:25,818
You think you're having a good time and you're partying,

348
00:20:25,878 --> 00:20:27,539
but when you really listen to the lyrics,

349
00:20:27,999 --> 00:20:30,900
it's a person's story of alcoholism and drinking to fit in.

350
00:20:31,541 --> 00:20:33,281
And that was actually what was happening to Bob,

351
00:20:33,301 --> 00:20:34,362
and that was what we were trying to do.

352
00:20:34,382 --> 00:20:36,082
We were trying to create this fun experience,

353
00:20:36,582 --> 00:20:38,183
but tell a sad story.

354
00:20:38,883 --> 00:20:40,604
So I started really thinking how we were using

355
00:20:40,644 --> 00:20:42,165
the themes of alcoholism in the level.

356
00:20:45,362 --> 00:20:50,450
And so we started really exploring how we can use environmental storytelling to say

357
00:20:50,671 --> 00:20:57,501
and experience what happened to Bob and his memories, and also to find a way to move the

358
00:20:57,541 --> 00:20:58,363
player through 3D space.

359
00:21:00,266 --> 00:21:02,548
So in one of our initial brainstorms for Bob's Bottles,

360
00:21:02,608 --> 00:21:04,429
we came up with this really great idea,

361
00:21:04,890 --> 00:21:06,911
since we knew you had to visit his mother.

362
00:21:06,931 --> 00:21:10,434
And similar to Bob, he would spend his time,

363
00:21:10,494 --> 00:21:12,776
she would spend her time in the greenhouse drinking.

364
00:21:13,417 --> 00:21:15,578
So we needed some way for you to kind of have these moments

365
00:21:15,678 --> 00:21:17,039
of interacting with her,

366
00:21:17,600 --> 00:21:19,742
even though she's not necessarily present in your memories.

367
00:21:20,742 --> 00:21:22,444
And also, how we can tell the story

368
00:21:22,704 --> 00:21:24,926
of how her condition deteriorated.

369
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:29,496
So we came up with the idea of this recursive kitchen.

370
00:21:30,457 --> 00:21:33,261
We have this really great relative gravity mechanic.

371
00:21:33,882 --> 00:21:36,765
And so we wanted to use that mechanic in this space

372
00:21:37,186 --> 00:21:39,249
and also find some way to tell Bob's story

373
00:21:39,269 --> 00:21:41,271
without necessarily having to see her suffer.

374
00:21:44,141 --> 00:21:46,724
So when you're in the kitchen, you start to see,

375
00:21:46,864 --> 00:21:48,025
as you progress through the level,

376
00:21:48,065 --> 00:21:50,247
you start to begin to see this vegetation

377
00:21:50,327 --> 00:21:51,188
take over the kitchen.

378
00:21:51,688 --> 00:21:53,390
And the vegetation represents the greenhouse

379
00:21:53,430 --> 00:21:55,792
where she would drink and also where Bob drinks.

380
00:21:56,113 --> 00:21:59,296
So it's a really subtle way of saying

381
00:21:59,316 --> 00:22:01,678
her mental state is starting to deteriorate.

382
00:22:02,619 --> 00:22:05,602
We also wanted to show ways of what happened to her

383
00:22:05,622 --> 00:22:07,123
without necessarily having to show.

384
00:22:08,022 --> 00:22:09,984
you know, something violent and unsettling,

385
00:22:10,024 --> 00:22:12,365
because this is really about Bob's memories of his mom,

386
00:22:13,006 --> 00:22:15,447
not the tragic exactly what happened moment.

387
00:22:16,128 --> 00:22:17,389
So we wanted something very tasteful

388
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,990
in a way to sort of what happened to her

389
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,771
as a result of her addiction.

390
00:22:24,317 --> 00:22:26,979
So this is a quick, really first pass play through

391
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:27,760
one of our kitchens.

392
00:22:28,160 --> 00:22:31,022
This is kitchen number two, and the first one is pristine,

393
00:22:31,062 --> 00:22:34,364
but this one really shows you the various details

394
00:22:34,404 --> 00:22:36,365
that we are starting to play around with.

395
00:22:36,946 --> 00:22:38,187
As you progress through the kitchens,

396
00:22:38,307 --> 00:22:41,449
the dishes pile up higher, the greenhouse ticks over,

397
00:22:41,909 --> 00:22:44,291
the space becomes a little bit more relative gravity.

398
00:22:44,911 --> 00:22:50,033
So what we're really trying to do, in addition to telling Bob's story through audio cues,

399
00:22:50,154 --> 00:22:54,075
you know, he's running through the kitchen calling out for his mother and noticing things

400
00:22:54,135 --> 00:23:01,259
about something being wrong, that we were able to kind of tell this really sad story in a subtle

401
00:23:01,299 --> 00:23:06,061
way without necessarily having to point to all of the alcohol bottles and the obvious problems.

402
00:23:08,402 --> 00:23:09,263
And this is the final result.

403
00:23:09,283 --> 00:23:10,463
The greenhouse for so long.

404
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:14,290
This is when the greenhouse has taken over.

405
00:23:14,310 --> 00:23:16,952
This is our environment artist, Nick Maxim,

406
00:23:17,973 --> 00:23:18,914
doing some voiceover.

407
00:23:20,895 --> 00:23:22,877
So you can see the greenhouse has fully taken over.

408
00:23:23,257 --> 00:23:24,959
Toward the end, you see these red bottles

409
00:23:24,999 --> 00:23:26,360
kind of pointing to her fate.

410
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:30,823
And then you find out her fate once you enter the drain

411
00:23:31,024 --> 00:23:32,265
and find her memory seed.

412
00:23:35,833 --> 00:23:38,455
So we were able to find a way to tell that story,

413
00:23:38,495 --> 00:23:40,416
but we had another challenging story to tell,

414
00:23:40,517 --> 00:23:42,358
and this one was the helmet bottle.

415
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:46,180
And Helmet is a character who is also one of the Psychonauts,

416
00:23:46,761 --> 00:23:48,762
who is sort of a central figure in this story

417
00:23:48,802 --> 00:23:49,402
for Psychonauts 2.

418
00:23:50,803 --> 00:23:57,312
Helmut passed away in the battle against Meligula and that fissure really broke the Psychonauts.

419
00:23:58,453 --> 00:24:05,062
So Helmut was a very important story and he was also Bob's love of his life and so his

420
00:24:05,142 --> 00:24:09,107
loss of Helmut was a pivotal moment in why he is the way he is.

421
00:24:12,962 --> 00:24:15,764
So when we started working on Bob's Bottles,

422
00:24:15,824 --> 00:24:17,985
the design team had a really strong idea,

423
00:24:18,025 --> 00:24:19,947
which is that there was going to be this landmark

424
00:24:19,987 --> 00:24:21,788
in the distance that you had to ascend to.

425
00:24:22,649 --> 00:24:24,930
And we liked that idea because so much of Psychonauts

426
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:25,931
ended up being very flat,

427
00:24:26,692 --> 00:24:28,253
or you were kind of going down and around,

428
00:24:28,273 --> 00:24:29,834
but there wasn't a lot of going up.

429
00:24:30,174 --> 00:24:31,575
So we liked the idea of ascending,

430
00:24:32,076 --> 00:24:34,297
but we didn't know what we were actually ascending to.

431
00:24:34,437 --> 00:24:36,499
We know that most of the levels start in a swamp

432
00:24:36,519 --> 00:24:37,239
and then they change,

433
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,401
but we weren't quite sure where we were going.

434
00:24:41,252 --> 00:24:42,674
But because we knew this was about Helmut

435
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:43,795
and it was the love of his life,

436
00:24:44,055 --> 00:24:46,258
we quickly settled on the idea

437
00:24:46,899 --> 00:24:48,602
of the level being a wedding cake,

438
00:24:49,383 --> 00:24:50,324
a collapsed wedding cake.

439
00:24:53,050 --> 00:24:58,034
So I came up with some concepts and mood boards of what a collapsed wedding cake could look like,

440
00:24:58,074 --> 00:25:03,117
in addition to some feedback from our artists, to see how this surfacing could work for the level,

441
00:25:03,658 --> 00:25:08,581
how we could theme the cake so it isn't all sweet cotton candy and cherries.

442
00:25:08,641 --> 00:25:09,942
I mean, this is a really sad story.

443
00:25:10,763 --> 00:25:13,825
And we needed to figure out what was going to be at the top of this cake.

444
00:25:14,185 --> 00:25:15,326
You know, we weren't quite sure.

445
00:25:16,107 --> 00:25:19,032
what was going to be there at that time. We just knew you wanted to get to something.

446
00:25:19,112 --> 00:25:22,898
And there were various ideas like a sword or a Viking helmet, because that's what

447
00:25:22,938 --> 00:25:29,248
helmet wore. But it didn't really feel relevant to what Bob was missing and desiring.

448
00:25:32,139 --> 00:25:35,823
So I really looked at who Helmut was and what he looked like.

449
00:25:35,963 --> 00:25:38,225
And in the game, he's this really bright and colorful

450
00:25:38,265 --> 00:25:39,266
character in his level.

451
00:25:40,307 --> 00:25:42,949
But it didn't feel like that's how Bob would remember him.

452
00:25:43,830 --> 00:25:44,991
Bob is his long-lost lover.

453
00:25:46,432 --> 00:25:50,616
And because Helmut always wore this Viking hat,

454
00:25:50,676 --> 00:25:53,319
I imagine he had this very idealized vision

455
00:25:53,359 --> 00:25:54,300
of what Helmut looked like.

456
00:25:55,020 --> 00:26:00,926
And so I digged through some old concepts that Scott Campbell did, and I found these really great,

457
00:26:01,606 --> 00:26:07,832
this really great sketch over here to the left of, you know, a shirtless Viking Bob. And I thought

458
00:26:07,872 --> 00:26:11,655
that that would be the ideal version of Bob to create at the top of this cake.

459
00:26:14,988 --> 00:26:16,768
And this is, you know, your final result.

460
00:26:16,788 --> 00:26:18,009
We have this really great cake.

461
00:26:18,669 --> 00:26:22,210
And then you ascend as you realize that this is the moment

462
00:26:22,230 --> 00:26:24,150
that Bob, you know, always wanted.

463
00:26:24,210 --> 00:26:25,351
He wanted to ask him to marry him.

464
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,772
Until you reach the top, and then things get very sad.

465
00:26:31,832 --> 00:26:32,953
So we know where we're going.

466
00:26:33,013 --> 00:26:34,413
We finally figured out what the topper was.

467
00:26:34,493 --> 00:26:35,613
We knew we were making a cake,

468
00:26:35,713 --> 00:26:37,934
but how are you gonna get to the top?

469
00:26:39,352 --> 00:26:43,393
So we started doing sketches on what the various tiers of the cake could look like.

470
00:26:44,034 --> 00:26:47,054
And we started theming those around what you do at a wedding.

471
00:26:47,935 --> 00:26:54,797
So we were thinking of like, you know, there's a candy table, there's, you know, the dollar

472
00:26:54,837 --> 00:26:58,878
dance and the, you know, bride and the, you know, groom's dance.

473
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:02,967
Hmm, we weren't quite sure what we were going to do with the space.

474
00:27:03,027 --> 00:27:05,352
And then we talked with our combat designer, Laura Scott,

475
00:27:05,813 --> 00:27:08,178
and I quickly realized we needed a place for a fight.

476
00:27:08,659 --> 00:27:11,785
And I couldn't think of a better place for a fight at a wedding than the reception.

477
00:27:15,245 --> 00:27:17,507
So this is the reception area that we created.

478
00:27:18,088 --> 00:27:22,050
And you can see the continued ascent up to the Bob Topper.

479
00:27:22,471 --> 00:27:23,872
But we were able to create a fun space

480
00:27:23,892 --> 00:27:26,634
where you could throw chairs and knock over dishes

481
00:27:26,794 --> 00:27:27,735
and beat up the DJ.

482
00:27:27,815 --> 00:27:31,738
So it was a really fun way to express a wedding.

483
00:27:35,725 --> 00:27:37,968
In addition to creating and understanding spaces,

484
00:27:37,988 --> 00:27:40,071
there are a lot of mechanical things we had to figure out.

485
00:27:40,712 --> 00:27:42,795
One, we had wall jumps, and we are trying to figure out

486
00:27:42,815 --> 00:27:44,417
how do you wall jump against a cake?

487
00:27:44,557 --> 00:27:45,859
So this is a really quick concept

488
00:27:45,919 --> 00:27:48,622
we did on how you could possibly use cake

489
00:27:48,682 --> 00:27:50,325
as a wall jump object.

490
00:27:55,075 --> 00:28:00,399
And we also had to figure out how you were going to get to from the bottom of the cake,

491
00:28:00,419 --> 00:28:05,662
which is the swap, to the next tier, which takes you from the swing to the reception area.

492
00:28:06,542 --> 00:28:10,925
And one of the challenges we had was we didn't want to make this a large level. This is one

493
00:28:10,945 --> 00:28:15,808
of the last levels we had to make. We still had bosses to finish. Like we can't spend six

494
00:28:15,849 --> 00:28:19,551
months on this. So we needed to figure out some quick way to get you to the top of the cake.

495
00:28:21,521 --> 00:28:25,725
So one of the great things about our new process was that one of the ways we kind of worked

496
00:28:25,825 --> 00:28:29,489
out ideation quickly was that we would do quick prototypes with design.

497
00:28:30,150 --> 00:28:33,713
So they would do quick prototypes of mechanics and we would try to figure out what art would

498
00:28:33,733 --> 00:28:34,514
do to support that.

499
00:28:35,215 --> 00:28:38,818
And sometimes those prototypes ended up in the game, a lot of them did not.

500
00:28:40,219 --> 00:28:44,360
One of the prototypes that I really enjoyed was in the,

501
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:48,061
it was supposed to be a large tree inside of the QA.

502
00:28:48,521 --> 00:28:51,262
And early on, the inside of that tree got cut.

503
00:28:51,802 --> 00:28:54,222
And so the prototype for that got cut as well.

504
00:28:54,282 --> 00:28:55,783
So it was just kind of laying around for years

505
00:28:55,823 --> 00:28:56,623
and not being used.

506
00:28:57,823 --> 00:29:01,384
And our lead designer, Seth Marinello, undug it,

507
00:29:01,524 --> 00:29:03,144
and he came up with an innovative way

508
00:29:03,204 --> 00:29:04,405
to get us to the top of the cake.

509
00:29:08,179 --> 00:29:09,422
All right, this is the before.

510
00:29:14,569 --> 00:29:19,211
He created a mechanical space where there's essentially a Euclidean design.

511
00:29:19,772 --> 00:29:22,974
You can get, you know, this memory seed prompts you to enter,

512
00:29:23,434 --> 00:29:27,256
but essentially it's a unending, recurring tunnel.

513
00:29:28,057 --> 00:29:32,380
And it was a very interesting way to, one, get you through the layers of the cake

514
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:36,782
and to get you to transport you anywhere that we needed you to go.

515
00:29:37,563 --> 00:29:42,306
So it turned out to be a really great way to visualize the inside of our cake.

516
00:29:45,619 --> 00:29:48,581
And this is the final look. So you're seeing the cake layers.

517
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:53,284
I will use the icing as a marker to make sure you knew what direction you were going.

518
00:29:53,304 --> 00:29:54,786
Wait, no! I want that!

519
00:29:56,427 --> 00:29:58,308
And of course the memory seeds still driving you through.

520
00:29:58,328 --> 00:30:00,490
There's some string lights to kind of drive you forward.

521
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:00,890
Wait a minute!

522
00:30:01,291 --> 00:30:03,632
And you also notice that the cake layers are changing.

523
00:30:03,652 --> 00:30:04,853
I don't know about this place.

524
00:30:06,795 --> 00:30:09,857
So the cake layers really helped sort of orient the player.

525
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:13,800
So he knew if you were going too far forward or too far back because the cake layers would change.

526
00:30:14,691 --> 00:30:17,596
So it was a really great shader that our VFX team made

527
00:30:17,636 --> 00:30:20,401
in order to really sell that you were inside

528
00:30:20,561 --> 00:30:22,685
of this large, collapsing, crumpled cake.

529
00:30:27,657 --> 00:30:32,160
And so this really great results came together for Bob,

530
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:33,640
even though it was one of our hardest levels

531
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,601
to tell the story of.

532
00:30:36,882 --> 00:30:38,943
And I think it's also one of our best levels.

533
00:30:39,723 --> 00:30:41,324
We have wilder and wackier things,

534
00:30:41,404 --> 00:30:43,666
but from a vision and look standpoint,

535
00:30:43,686 --> 00:30:46,707
we have some of the widest range of looks,

536
00:30:47,167 --> 00:30:47,828
one of my favorite.

537
00:30:48,428 --> 00:30:49,809
I love the look of the kitchen.

538
00:30:50,490 --> 00:30:53,172
And it just really tells the story of what's happening

539
00:30:53,192 --> 00:30:54,012
to her really well.

540
00:30:54,373 --> 00:30:57,615
And I also just love the underground, underwater areas.

541
00:30:57,715 --> 00:31:01,879
Like, I would just sit in those spaces with the engine,

542
00:31:02,099 --> 00:31:03,940
game engine on and just enjoy being there.

543
00:31:04,361 --> 00:31:06,402
So I think Boz Bottles really came together.

544
00:31:06,842 --> 00:31:10,525
We found a way to tell a story about Helmut that was very human

545
00:31:11,066 --> 00:31:13,348
and focused on the challenges of addiction

546
00:31:13,368 --> 00:31:15,910
but not necessarily disrespectful to the topics.

547
00:31:18,068 --> 00:31:22,135
And it turned out to be, I think, one of our stronger levels thematically.

548
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:29,006
So now that we've gone through all the brains that we needed to do,

549
00:31:29,467 --> 00:31:31,931
the last hurdle we had to get through was boss fights.

550
00:31:33,614 --> 00:31:35,756
And boss fights were on the chopping block

551
00:31:35,776 --> 00:31:37,858
for getting cut for quite some time

552
00:31:38,338 --> 00:31:41,041
because we were just constantly trying

553
00:31:41,081 --> 00:31:42,522
to deal with funding and time

554
00:31:43,082 --> 00:31:44,604
because that's what happens when you make games.

555
00:31:45,184 --> 00:31:48,667
So, boss art jams were a quick way

556
00:31:48,707 --> 00:31:50,469
that we put our ideas together

557
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,250
in order to execute on five bosses

558
00:31:52,370 --> 00:31:55,253
in maybe six to eight months, which is insane.

559
00:31:55,673 --> 00:31:56,994
Usually when boss takes five months.

560
00:31:57,795 --> 00:31:59,937
But we needed to form multiple strike teams

561
00:31:59,977 --> 00:32:01,138
so we could hit our ship date.

562
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:06,731
So one of the ways that I did that was doing an art jam session with the artists.

563
00:32:07,952 --> 00:32:12,896
So art jams is something that Double Fine had done previously. It's just sort of a casual way for

564
00:32:12,936 --> 00:32:17,279
them to hang out. We would meet at lunch. You would come up with a theme and the artists would

565
00:32:17,299 --> 00:32:21,601
just draw something for fun. It was just a regular thing they did. Occasionally they would do that

566
00:32:21,621 --> 00:32:25,744
when they're kicking off a game, but it wasn't just something we did constantly.

567
00:32:26,805 --> 00:32:31,230
So people were having so much fun in that meeting and at this point everyone was kind of burnt out

568
00:32:31,710 --> 00:32:35,294
after two years of levels and the bosses were kind of the last hurl,

569
00:32:35,334 --> 00:32:38,417
so I wanted to come up with a fun way for the team to interact with one another again.

570
00:32:39,927 --> 00:32:45,910
So we leveraged all the talent and focus of the artists in the studio on a big game jam,

571
00:32:46,730 --> 00:32:49,471
not game jam, but boss jam session that we called the Boss Blitz.

572
00:32:50,072 --> 00:32:55,134
And we would tackle one boss at a time. And so that format really helped us sort of come up

573
00:32:55,154 --> 00:32:58,556
with these really strong ideas for what our boss encounters could look like.

574
00:33:02,209 --> 00:33:07,897
One of the best and the first art jams we did was for Hollis' level, Hollis' hot streak.

575
00:33:09,239 --> 00:33:13,245
So there were some things we knew about the boss, but we just had a really hard time nailing

576
00:33:13,265 --> 00:33:14,848
what she looked like throughout the development.

577
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:23,229
So we knew that she had to be an octopus because the hotel you go to in the first mission is octopus-shaped.

578
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:28,236
And we also established that for Hollis, her addiction takes the form of an octopus.

579
00:33:29,858 --> 00:33:31,741
So we knew that that language needed to be there.

580
00:33:32,802 --> 00:33:37,866
what the octopus did and what attacks she had kept changing over time.

581
00:33:38,347 --> 00:33:42,410
And what you're seeing here is this random collection of all the weird things we thought

582
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:48,394
we could do with the boss. And a lot of this fluctuation happened because we were constantly

583
00:33:48,494 --> 00:33:51,777
changing the power. It was probably one of the last powers we nailed the mechanics on.

584
00:33:52,337 --> 00:33:56,180
So it just sort of led to some challenging results for our designs.

585
00:33:58,062 --> 00:34:00,483
You've seen the Luctopus Hotel here on the left.

586
00:34:00,943 --> 00:34:05,945
One of the fun, weird designs we had, it was very early on, based on the mental connection

587
00:34:06,025 --> 00:34:10,207
mechanic at that time, was that she would be a computerized beast.

588
00:34:11,548 --> 00:34:15,390
And that was because at the time, mental connection operated like mental taffy, but you could

589
00:34:15,410 --> 00:34:18,852
also use it to string electrical charges together.

590
00:34:20,513 --> 00:34:23,894
It was a unique experience of using mental connection,

591
00:34:24,375 --> 00:34:27,356
but it was confusing because you could do something positive

592
00:34:27,376 --> 00:34:29,357
with the same power and then have it be putative.

593
00:34:29,978 --> 00:34:31,679
So it just didn't really land.

594
00:34:32,579 --> 00:34:34,840
So we abandoned that and then we started,

595
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,562
you know, let the power kind of settle

596
00:34:37,602 --> 00:34:39,883
and as the story changed, so did Lucky's look.

597
00:34:40,344 --> 00:34:42,945
So these are all the various ways we tried to express Lucky,

598
00:34:42,985 --> 00:34:44,906
but they just weren't really hitting.

599
00:34:45,706 --> 00:34:46,827
But now with the power settled,

600
00:34:46,867 --> 00:34:49,188
we felt it was a good time to revisit it.

601
00:34:52,251 --> 00:34:57,435
So we kicked off a new jam, and I'll just give you some quick updates of what you should do to prepare for an Rjam,

602
00:34:57,475 --> 00:35:03,680
and these are really effective sessions, especially if you can bring people from your team or who are not on your team to them

603
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:06,122
to help kind of shake the team up in some of their ideas.

604
00:35:07,163 --> 00:35:12,127
So the first thing you do with Rjam, you do need a little bit of preparation, and that is to...

605
00:35:14,419 --> 00:35:15,922
Remind people of the mission that they're on,

606
00:35:16,403 --> 00:35:18,147
and you give them information about where they're going.

607
00:35:18,327 --> 00:35:20,612
Here's an example of one of the decks we use

608
00:35:21,033 --> 00:35:23,378
to get people prepared to enter Hollis's mind

609
00:35:23,398 --> 00:35:24,420
and what they're going to experience.

610
00:35:26,562 --> 00:35:29,524
There's also information about where you're going to have this battle.

611
00:35:29,965 --> 00:35:31,346
This is a concept from Peter Chan.

612
00:35:32,306 --> 00:35:38,031
He, very early on, he did this concept and we liked the idea of this kind of room that was made of playing cards

613
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:43,836
that would kind of fall apart if you had a fight or a battle or would react to what's happening.

614
00:35:44,516 --> 00:35:47,859
So we kind of knew what space we wanted, but not exactly how we were going to use it.

615
00:35:49,209 --> 00:35:51,750
We also wanted to update people on who else is in the fight.

616
00:35:52,390 --> 00:35:57,712
The interns are in this fight, and so we wanted people to think of ways to find the interns

617
00:35:57,792 --> 00:36:03,234
and use them in their fight and outside of the battle with our boss and with Raz.

618
00:36:06,436 --> 00:36:11,381
And last but not least, you also want to remind them of the mechanics.

619
00:36:13,222 --> 00:36:17,146
A lot of the bosses' behaviors and look are going to be changed by their attacks.

620
00:36:17,186 --> 00:36:19,088
So, we wanted to also let the player know,

621
00:36:19,148 --> 00:36:21,151
like, this is the main power we want you to use.

622
00:36:21,171 --> 00:36:24,114
You can use others, but we want your attacks to focus on this one.

623
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:28,738
So, these are the results for some of those jams.

624
00:36:30,275 --> 00:36:32,295
If you look closely, you can see how some of these ideas

625
00:36:32,355 --> 00:36:33,355
ended up in the final game.

626
00:36:34,116 --> 00:36:37,696
This is a quick concept sketches done by Nathan Bagel,

627
00:36:38,276 --> 00:36:41,237
Stapley, and these are quick ideations

628
00:36:41,337 --> 00:36:44,098
on what the form of the Luctopus could take,

629
00:36:44,518 --> 00:36:47,498
but most importantly, how she could work within play space.

630
00:36:47,958 --> 00:36:49,779
And I thought this was a really great little sketch

631
00:36:49,839 --> 00:36:51,019
over here on the bottom right,

632
00:36:51,479 --> 00:36:53,440
because that became a very clear way

633
00:36:53,520 --> 00:36:55,500
to help us solve a different problem

634
00:36:55,520 --> 00:36:56,720
we were having with the Luctopus.

635
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:03,853
One of the biggest challenges we also had with Luctopus was her scale.

636
00:37:04,354 --> 00:37:06,174
We know we wanted her to be gigantic.

637
00:37:06,214 --> 00:37:10,636
She has this big symbolism of addiction, or gambling addiction.

638
00:37:10,656 --> 00:37:13,417
So we know she had to have a large scale, and she was a boss,

639
00:37:13,437 --> 00:37:14,618
so she needed to be foreboding.

640
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:18,299
But the challenge is that Lucky had eight limbs.

641
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:21,400
She's an octopus, and that is a nightmare for an animator

642
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:26,302
to have to animate a character or creature with eight unique tentacles.

643
00:37:28,736 --> 00:37:32,280
So our team got together and really started thinking about

644
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,744
how can we use Lucky's form in a unique way

645
00:37:36,224 --> 00:37:38,587
and also create some cool and unique attacks.

646
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:42,244
So once we started brainstorming about what we could do

647
00:37:42,284 --> 00:37:45,146
with tentacles, a very fun idea started to emerge.

648
00:37:45,226 --> 00:37:47,388
So we knew that we wanted the room

649
00:37:47,468 --> 00:37:49,870
that you started the boss battle into break apart,

650
00:37:50,851 --> 00:37:52,032
but we didn't know quite how.

651
00:37:52,232 --> 00:37:53,453
And we also knew we didn't want

652
00:37:53,533 --> 00:37:55,655
to animate eight unique tentacles.

653
00:37:56,095 --> 00:37:57,837
So we needed to come up with a unique way

654
00:37:57,897 --> 00:37:59,778
for the boss to present himself and attack.

655
00:38:00,714 --> 00:38:03,657
And so Chris Clam did these really great concepts

656
00:38:04,098 --> 00:38:06,420
of how the Lucky could work in the space

657
00:38:06,440 --> 00:38:07,241
and what Raz could do.

658
00:38:08,242 --> 00:38:10,324
And you start to see that the tentacles

659
00:38:10,504 --> 00:38:12,687
are taking the form of a room on the left,

660
00:38:13,227 --> 00:38:15,549
and then on the right, now we're seeing some ideas

661
00:38:15,590 --> 00:38:18,252
of the tentacles are actually just independent elements

662
00:38:18,392 --> 00:38:20,975
as well, and sort of take on the form

663
00:38:21,075 --> 00:38:22,797
of the room that is breaking apart.

664
00:38:23,869 --> 00:38:28,499
And thankfully having the artists and the animators involved, particularly the animator,

665
00:38:28,539 --> 00:38:33,872
helped us brainstorm attacks that worked for animation and didn't create too much of a scope creep.

666
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:38,124
So what you're seeing here is the final example

667
00:38:38,705 --> 00:38:41,366
of some of the sketches that actually ended up in the game,

668
00:38:41,867 --> 00:38:44,288
particularly the card pass over there on the upper left

669
00:38:44,568 --> 00:38:46,290
and the defibrillator on the upper right.

670
00:38:47,330 --> 00:38:48,991
Both of those attacks are in the final game

671
00:38:49,031 --> 00:38:51,473
and that came from these really quick art jams.

672
00:38:51,493 --> 00:38:53,194
It just sort of invigorated the team

673
00:38:53,214 --> 00:38:55,055
and we quickly threw prototypes together

674
00:38:55,095 --> 00:38:55,976
based on these sketches.

675
00:38:58,525 --> 00:39:00,787
So now that we knew what Lucky needed to do

676
00:39:00,907 --> 00:39:02,889
and what attacks she was going to have,

677
00:39:02,949 --> 00:39:04,830
the final thing was to finally go back

678
00:39:04,890 --> 00:39:05,751
and finish her design.

679
00:39:06,852 --> 00:39:08,954
So we went back to Scott Campbell

680
00:39:09,294 --> 00:39:12,937
and we wanted to revisit one of the first ideas for Lucky.

681
00:39:12,957 --> 00:39:15,099
And we really liked the idea of her

682
00:39:15,159 --> 00:39:16,500
being made of a neon sign.

683
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:18,182
That was one of the first things we thought

684
00:39:18,662 --> 00:39:20,043
and Levi sketched out.

685
00:39:20,484 --> 00:39:23,146
And so we wanted to revisit that, but in a new form.

686
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:29,449
Design also thought it would be a really great idea to use her body as a way to give feedback.

687
00:39:29,810 --> 00:39:34,252
So her light states change based on how she's taking damage or attacks or if she's upset.

688
00:39:35,112 --> 00:39:40,175
And then you see the design for, you know, the push design of the tentacles and what they could work and look like.

689
00:39:41,175 --> 00:39:45,797
My favorite little detail is the little cuff link cuff at the end, you know, because she's a little poker player.

690
00:39:46,298 --> 00:39:50,320
So those little details all finally came together and we knew who our boss was going to be.

691
00:39:53,129 --> 00:39:55,551
In addition to finalizing the look of the design,

692
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:56,712
we started doing prototypes.

693
00:39:56,932 --> 00:39:58,673
And this is a quick example of a prototype

694
00:39:58,773 --> 00:40:00,455
that Chris Clam did to prove that we

695
00:40:00,555 --> 00:40:02,736
could get the tentacle to work as an attack element.

696
00:40:04,277 --> 00:40:09,501
And that was sort of like the final confirmation

697
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:12,023
we needed that we just needed to move forward and finalize

698
00:40:12,063 --> 00:40:12,704
this boss fight.

699
00:40:14,725 --> 00:40:16,406
I made some bad connections in your mind.

700
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:19,068
And this is the final moment, the reveal moment

701
00:40:19,108 --> 00:40:19,809
that's in the game.

702
00:40:46,734 --> 00:40:49,316
Who are you calling a bad idea?

703
00:40:52,660 --> 00:40:54,682
I am the sweetest of dreams.

704
00:40:55,083 --> 00:40:57,906
The spirit of unbeatable optimism.

705
00:40:58,527 --> 00:41:02,171
I am the ultimate victory of hope over mathematics.

706
00:41:03,232 --> 00:41:05,635
I am the Lady Luctopus.

707
00:41:06,315 --> 00:41:07,797
But you can call me Lucky.

708
00:41:11,047 --> 00:41:13,769
So lucky we really came together well through this process.

709
00:41:14,449 --> 00:41:16,890
So Art Jams are a really great tool

710
00:41:16,930 --> 00:41:17,891
you can use with your team.

711
00:41:17,951 --> 00:41:19,932
It gives the artist something fun to do,

712
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:21,873
especially if they're not on your team

713
00:41:21,913 --> 00:41:23,294
and they just wanna get away from their projects

714
00:41:23,314 --> 00:41:25,115
so they can solve somebody else's problems.

715
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:28,076
It's also a really great way to give the team themselves

716
00:41:28,236 --> 00:41:30,258
just a wealth of ideas to pull from if they get stuck.

717
00:41:30,958 --> 00:41:33,399
And it just turned out to be a fun process

718
00:41:33,419 --> 00:41:35,200
that I'm definitely gonna be using moving forward.

719
00:41:37,702 --> 00:41:38,482
So that is the,

720
00:41:40,464 --> 00:41:48,006
End of the talk, I'd like to share with you this reel of all the beautiful places that we've made in Psychonauts.

721
00:41:48,886 --> 00:41:56,848
And it's just been an honor and an achievement to work on a game of this scale and quality with such a small team.

722
00:41:57,328 --> 00:42:04,690
There are only 73 people in the studio at Devil Fine. Large studios have 300-400 people.

723
00:42:05,210 --> 00:42:10,011
So it's just really an achievement that we were able to create such a fun and unique experience.

724
00:42:11,072 --> 00:42:15,195
Well, this is a varied and just breadth of beautiful style.

725
00:42:15,375 --> 00:42:17,637
I mean, this was a unique project to work on.

726
00:42:18,558 --> 00:42:23,483
To have 13 brain levels that all need to be art-directed differently was an insane challenge,

727
00:42:23,883 --> 00:42:28,187
but I think that it paid off to just a beautiful player experience that you're seeing here.

728
00:42:29,708 --> 00:42:32,370
So I just want to say a great thank you to the team at Double Fine.

729
00:42:38,173 --> 00:42:39,720
And we can move on to Q&A.

730
00:42:58,527 --> 00:43:00,149
Anyone have any questions?

731
00:43:00,930 --> 00:43:06,357
Quick note, just like the game, there

732
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:07,739
is a mental health advisory.

733
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:09,822
So we are discussing sensitive topics.

734
00:43:10,282 --> 00:43:13,707
So please handle them with care and empathy.

735
00:43:15,734 --> 00:43:15,954
Hi.

736
00:43:16,714 --> 00:43:17,075
Hi.

737
00:43:18,076 --> 00:43:20,638
So this is more of a comment for admiration.

738
00:43:20,718 --> 00:43:24,781
So I just want to thank you very much for being in this space.

739
00:43:24,801 --> 00:43:26,903
You actually gave me so much agency

740
00:43:26,983 --> 00:43:30,346
to be in this career and grow in this career.

741
00:43:30,426 --> 00:43:32,228
So thank you so, so much.

742
00:43:32,588 --> 00:43:34,570
I don't have any questions for you.

743
00:43:35,030 --> 00:43:37,893
Just a big, big thank you for appreciation.

744
00:43:38,714 --> 00:43:38,914
Thank you.

745
00:43:46,267 --> 00:43:51,649
So I want to start out by saying that you did such an excellent job of making Lobato's level really gross.

746
00:43:51,809 --> 00:43:57,270
Like, I hate teeth. I can't do teeth.

747
00:43:57,330 --> 00:44:04,092
But I wanted to play this game so bad that I literally, some parts of Lobato's level, I literally had to close my eyes.

748
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:08,153
Like, so yeah, that's it was awful.

749
00:44:08,193 --> 00:44:08,493
Thank you.

750
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:17,522
But my question, my question was, the figments are such a big part of

751
00:44:17,762 --> 00:44:21,587
Psychonauts and especially even more so than the first game.

752
00:44:22,047 --> 00:44:28,314
These figments are so unique to each level and do are such a part of that storytelling

753
00:44:28,875 --> 00:44:31,057
that really helps tell the story of what's going on there.

754
00:44:31,498 --> 00:44:32,039
But also.

755
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:42,084
The fundraising campaign, I know one level of rewards was backers were able to design their own figments and put those in the game and that was a reward.

756
00:44:42,444 --> 00:44:53,690
So I really wanted to know how you compromise the figments as a storytelling element that were unique and important to the level with the backers' ideas and their, that system.

757
00:44:54,911 --> 00:44:59,675
Yeah, we had, well, the figments have always been a really special thing, as you mentioned, to the game.

758
00:45:00,156 --> 00:45:06,962
And it was extremely important to Tim that we make them as unique and built into the space as possible.

759
00:45:07,342 --> 00:45:13,308
So for the backers, what we ended up doing was getting requests from them on what they wanted their figment to be.

760
00:45:13,668 --> 00:45:17,151
And we tried to find spaces that made sense visually for them.

761
00:45:17,171 --> 00:45:20,834
I mean, some of them are like cat butts, so I don't know what you're going to do with the cat butt.

762
00:45:21,275 --> 00:45:21,475
But...

763
00:45:22,837 --> 00:45:24,698
The rest of them maybe were a little bit more physical.

764
00:45:24,758 --> 00:45:27,659
So we tried to find thematic places where they worked.

765
00:45:28,580 --> 00:45:30,341
Just as a follow up, were there any that you were

766
00:45:30,541 --> 00:45:32,482
absolutely just couldn't find a place for?

767
00:45:36,384 --> 00:45:37,344
No, I don't think so.

768
00:45:37,364 --> 00:45:39,966
I mean, our worlds are so wacky and varied.

769
00:45:40,846 --> 00:45:42,087
We found a place for everything.

770
00:45:42,887 --> 00:45:43,448
Thank you so much.

771
00:45:47,590 --> 00:45:49,071
Hello, hi, Elisette.

772
00:45:49,451 --> 00:45:50,611
I'm Yuson, I work at.

773
00:45:51,362 --> 00:45:55,103
EA and I had a pleasure of working with you many, many years ago and I'm still there.

774
00:45:55,783 --> 00:46:00,845
After you left EA you had a really colorful career and the last two places are this one

775
00:46:01,085 --> 00:46:08,948
as an art director and the one before was art manager at Ubisoft. How would you describe the

776
00:46:08,968 --> 00:46:13,910
differences between art manager and art director and what made you come back to art direction?

777
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:18,175
Yes, I think that depends from studio to studio,

778
00:46:18,215 --> 00:46:20,176
but if I was gonna give you like a high level difference,

779
00:46:20,997 --> 00:46:24,099
art management focuses on the scheduling and the staff

780
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,101
where art direction is more focused on the visual design

781
00:46:27,121 --> 00:46:28,082
and what you're making,

782
00:46:28,603 --> 00:46:31,605
but a studio like Double Fine, it's really two jobs.

783
00:46:31,845 --> 00:46:33,466
So I was doing a little bit of both.

784
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,269
At a studio like Ubisoft,

785
00:46:37,329 --> 00:46:38,930
I was also doing a little bit of both.

786
00:46:38,950 --> 00:46:39,891
So it's one of those like,

787
00:46:40,572 --> 00:46:45,234
two for jobs, if you're going to be honest, or you do end up doing a little bit of both.

788
00:46:45,734 --> 00:46:49,436
But some studios have just dedicated art directors and that's all of it do.

789
00:46:50,517 --> 00:46:53,579
So ideally, if you're working in a big project or a big studio,

790
00:46:53,759 --> 00:46:56,660
the two jobs are separated where the art manager works with the art director.

791
00:46:58,737 --> 00:47:00,459
I have one more question.

792
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:04,722
Double Fine has people who's been there forever.

793
00:47:05,283 --> 00:47:09,065
So I know that a lot of people are very close to each other, they know each other.

794
00:47:09,506 --> 00:47:13,749
How was it to come to that kind of environment when you are coming from outside?

795
00:47:14,890 --> 00:47:19,654
Well I think you do what you should do when you're in a space that is not yours and that

796
00:47:19,714 --> 00:47:21,615
is you learn and you listen and you get to know people.

797
00:47:22,822 --> 00:47:24,444
And so that's the first thing I did.

798
00:47:24,504 --> 00:47:26,445
I didn't come in trying to control.

799
00:47:26,625 --> 00:47:28,827
I just kind of came in to understand what was happening

800
00:47:28,847 --> 00:47:29,507
and how I could help.

801
00:47:30,088 --> 00:47:32,850
And I think that that was why I had a warm recession

802
00:47:32,910 --> 00:47:33,470
at Double Fine.

803
00:47:33,490 --> 00:47:35,432
Great, thank you.

804
00:47:37,333 --> 00:47:37,894
Next question.

805
00:47:38,754 --> 00:47:42,637
Hi, I was just quickly asking

806
00:47:43,718 --> 00:47:45,819
if there was any problems you had

807
00:47:46,120 --> 00:47:49,422
in making this game feel like a continuation of the last.

808
00:47:51,236 --> 00:47:55,419
Yes, at times. I think at the beginning of the project we were struggling to find our way.

809
00:47:55,439 --> 00:48:01,302
I think the concepts were really wild, but they didn't feel like they had a context to the characters.

810
00:48:01,702 --> 00:48:05,565
For example, there was an idea of making a macaroni level at the beginning,

811
00:48:05,585 --> 00:48:10,528
where you're just kind of going through a block of mac and cheese,

812
00:48:10,628 --> 00:48:13,369
but we didn't know where that would fit with the story.

813
00:48:14,650 --> 00:48:19,611
Bob's bottles, for example, was actually like inside of a bonsai topiary at first,

814
00:48:20,211 --> 00:48:23,972
because he was in his greenhouse, but there was just a lot of challenges with the space.

815
00:48:24,512 --> 00:48:29,574
So for us, it really has to be the marriage of story and environment that I think where we know

816
00:48:29,594 --> 00:48:32,174
we're kind of hitting something that was going to work.

817
00:48:34,075 --> 00:48:34,475
Thank you.

818
00:48:35,775 --> 00:48:36,215
Next question.

819
00:48:36,800 --> 00:48:43,867
Hi, you talked a lot about trying to keep the tone of the game with the themes that you're going for

820
00:48:44,968 --> 00:48:51,674
and trying to balance that in a sensitive way. How did you find coming to that? Was there a

821
00:48:51,734 --> 00:48:57,659
sort of core value that you kept trying to stick to or was it a sort of as it as the

822
00:48:57,719 --> 00:49:01,523
problem sort of came up like you said with the bottles level?

823
00:49:02,771 --> 00:49:08,259
So I think there are some tenets that we all kind of follow, pillars for design.

824
00:49:09,501 --> 00:49:13,406
I think one of the things we kind of always look for was whether something was psychonautical.

825
00:49:13,586 --> 00:49:14,908
We talked about that a little earlier.

826
00:49:15,469 --> 00:49:19,835
For me, artistically, I was always looking for what I consider the signatures of.

827
00:49:20,376 --> 00:49:22,257
Psychonauts style, the first thing is wonk,

828
00:49:22,778 --> 00:49:25,100
where nothing is exactly the same size,

829
00:49:25,160 --> 00:49:28,062
things are always askew, nothing is perfect angles,

830
00:49:28,723 --> 00:49:31,265
and that's a style that came from the first game,

831
00:49:31,285 --> 00:49:33,867
and we needed to make sure that was present in this game.

832
00:49:35,037 --> 00:49:38,198
Because it's kind of central to why the environments

833
00:49:38,258 --> 00:49:40,399
and levels feel very dreamlike.

834
00:49:41,239 --> 00:49:43,179
Everything is kind of off-kilter.

835
00:49:43,659 --> 00:49:45,980
So if things didn't kind of have that off-kilter,

836
00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:48,781
psychedelic kind of feel to them,

837
00:49:49,261 --> 00:49:51,301
we immediately knew they were a little bit off.

838
00:49:52,041 --> 00:49:55,442
In addition to that, Tim's a great storyteller.

839
00:49:55,502 --> 00:49:56,923
So if we had a strong story,

840
00:49:56,963 --> 00:49:59,083
we kind of had more meat to work with

841
00:49:59,503 --> 00:50:00,564
rather than some of the concepts

842
00:50:00,584 --> 00:50:01,844
that were a little bit more challenging.

843
00:50:02,544 --> 00:50:08,629
And third, I think we had some really great concepts artists on the team that helped us find that vision quickly.

844
00:50:08,649 --> 00:50:12,712
One of the key members of the first game was Peter Chan,

845
00:50:13,393 --> 00:50:16,015
and Peter Chan did a lot of the environment on Psychonauts 1.

846
00:50:16,595 --> 00:50:20,618
And while he wasn't a full-time or even barely a member on the team,

847
00:50:20,979 --> 00:50:25,602
he did come in at times in the beginning to help us do these really high-level art pieces.

848
00:50:26,423 --> 00:50:28,104
If you've ever seen Peter Chan's art, it's...

849
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:33,048
insane and he only works in pencil. I've never seen anybody like him. So he'll take these really

850
00:50:33,108 --> 00:50:37,691
odd things that Tim would give him and he would just come up with these pencil drawing sketches.

851
00:50:38,291 --> 00:50:44,816
And so those really early high, high level, just conceptual drawings, I think really told us whether

852
00:50:44,856 --> 00:50:49,259
we were hitting something or not. And when they felt cool, we just kind of kept pursuing. So that

853
00:50:49,699 --> 00:50:52,842
yes and thing we were talking about earlier. Thank you.

854
00:50:54,062 --> 00:50:54,523
Next question.

855
00:50:56,015 --> 00:51:03,762
I have another question about figments, more so about the process in how they ended up where they end up in the game.

856
00:51:04,362 --> 00:51:10,848
A lot of it feels that an artist was in there drawing that directly into that spot in the scene.

857
00:51:11,349 --> 00:51:17,454
However, there seems to be a lot of placement where it feels like a designer is, you know,

858
00:51:17,474 --> 00:51:21,758
this is a breadcrumb approach or this is a find the missing thing.

859
00:51:22,759 --> 00:51:28,723
For example, one figment was a missing slot machine in this spot, so they remove it from the environment.

860
00:51:29,183 --> 00:51:34,847
So I guess my question is, what is that process like? Is it going back and forth between design?

861
00:51:34,947 --> 00:51:38,709
Or do we just have sometimes an artist that goes in, delete a slot machine and put a figment there?

862
00:51:39,229 --> 00:51:40,350
I'm very curious how that works.

863
00:51:40,850 --> 00:51:43,071
I think it's a bit more collaborative, as you mentioned.

864
00:51:43,652 --> 00:51:47,054
We would come up with some really rough designs of what figments could look like in a space,

865
00:51:47,475 --> 00:51:50,517
but it wasn't until we were in them that we knew what was going to work.

866
00:51:51,238 --> 00:51:55,421
For example, we have some large doorways where there are figments inside of them, and we

867
00:51:55,461 --> 00:51:59,564
kind of use that as a way for you to know where to go forward, as you mentioned, the

868
00:51:59,604 --> 00:52:00,084
breadcrumbing.

869
00:52:00,625 --> 00:52:06,149
So, they're also used for visual storytelling and then a mix of kind of moving the player

870
00:52:06,189 --> 00:52:09,291
through or letting them know that there's something over here, please go there.

871
00:52:10,312 --> 00:52:11,513
So, you are correct.

872
00:52:11,553 --> 00:52:12,294
It was a little bit of both.

873
00:52:13,114 --> 00:52:13,795
Okay.

874
00:52:14,175 --> 00:52:16,457
If I may press, push one other question.

875
00:52:16,797 --> 00:52:21,420
Did you have a formalized process as you were going through it or was it more of a, as you

876
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,683
were reviewing it, pointing at a spot and saying, let's talk about figments here?

877
00:52:25,290 --> 00:52:29,413
I think it was a bit more of a pass that we would do at the end of the level,

878
00:52:29,433 --> 00:52:31,034
like once everything was kind of in place.

879
00:52:31,695 --> 00:52:35,157
There were some figments that were present just because we knew we needed them to be there

880
00:52:35,218 --> 00:52:38,660
for design needs, and then we would do a final pass so to make sure

881
00:52:38,700 --> 00:52:41,222
if there was anything with storytelling that we would go through.

882
00:52:41,322 --> 00:52:43,084
So it's a multi-phase process.

883
00:52:43,544 --> 00:52:46,867
It was what was necessary for design and then a second pass

884
00:52:46,887 --> 00:52:48,468
from what was necessary for aesthetics.

885
00:52:48,948 --> 00:52:49,509
All right, thank you.

886
00:52:51,360 --> 00:52:56,425
question. Kind of related to the previous question, I'm really curious about how your

887
00:52:56,445 --> 00:53:01,370
concept artists collaborated with your level designers to create something as fun and unique

888
00:53:01,410 --> 00:53:05,534
as this with as many iterations as it went through. Were there any specific points of

889
00:53:05,574 --> 00:53:11,541
friction that you found were kind of solved by a specific process? I would say that process

890
00:53:11,561 --> 00:53:13,863
was probably the thing I leaned into the most.

891
00:53:15,246 --> 00:53:18,528
especially with the concept team and the level team.

892
00:53:18,608 --> 00:53:20,509
So we always tried to make sure that the concept team

893
00:53:20,529 --> 00:53:21,990
was embedded with each level team

894
00:53:22,451 --> 00:53:24,672
so that they were developing concepts in time

895
00:53:24,772 --> 00:53:26,653
with those same partners.

896
00:53:27,313 --> 00:53:29,295
So we may not necessarily do a concept

897
00:53:29,455 --> 00:53:31,236
of a white-bot space immediately,

898
00:53:31,416 --> 00:53:33,457
but we will react to that, and then conversely.

899
00:53:34,037 --> 00:53:35,838
Somebody will say, I don't know what I'm doing here.

900
00:53:35,878 --> 00:53:36,899
Can you do a drawing?

901
00:53:37,099 --> 00:53:39,280
And so we would do a drawing and try

902
00:53:39,300 --> 00:53:40,540
to come up with some concepts of what

903
00:53:40,580 --> 00:53:41,501
could happen in the space.

904
00:53:41,541 --> 00:53:44,002
So it was really symbiotic.

905
00:53:44,762 --> 00:53:49,384
It wasn't like a very solid process, more of a art created

906
00:53:49,404 --> 00:53:50,885
in reaction to necessity.

907
00:53:52,286 --> 00:53:53,086
May I ask a follow up?

908
00:53:54,187 --> 00:53:56,788
How long did it take to kind of fall into a good cadence?

909
00:53:59,163 --> 00:54:04,747
I would say once I started, it took a few months, maybe almost a year to figure out

910
00:54:04,787 --> 00:54:06,408
what we needed to do for the reboot.

911
00:54:06,928 --> 00:54:10,551
And because we were under time pressure, we had to just kind of get E3 done.

912
00:54:11,052 --> 00:54:17,116
So once we knew we had a good way to work and we finished the Lobato level, I would

913
00:54:17,156 --> 00:54:19,838
say that team had a really strong understanding of how to move forward.

914
00:54:20,178 --> 00:54:21,819
And then the rest of the team had to fold in.

915
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:26,063
And I think that transition probably took a little bit longer to go from one strike

916
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,063
team to five strike teams.

917
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:29,017
or four strike teams.

918
00:54:32,462 --> 00:54:32,882
Five minutes?

919
00:54:33,463 --> 00:54:33,703
OK.

920
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:35,285
One more question?

921
00:54:36,026 --> 00:54:37,528
I know that you guys at Double Fine

922
00:54:37,568 --> 00:54:42,254
interact with education on an individual level.

923
00:54:42,294 --> 00:54:46,019
Does Double Fine as a studio provide anything for educators?

924
00:54:48,961 --> 00:54:50,923
Educate people who are educators outside of?

925
00:54:50,943 --> 00:54:54,946
Yeah, like at the collegiate level, like, you know, do you guys have like, here's stuff

926
00:54:54,966 --> 00:54:58,328
that you can use, like here's some of our anything like that, or is that more individual

927
00:54:58,388 --> 00:54:59,349
based on you guys?

928
00:55:00,089 --> 00:55:01,170
I think it's more individual.

929
00:55:01,190 --> 00:55:05,914
I don't think I've heard of a formal initiative to support educators.

930
00:55:06,534 --> 00:55:08,555
But I do think that's something that we would be interested in.

931
00:55:09,136 --> 00:55:10,997
We do have all of our work archived.

932
00:55:11,478 --> 00:55:13,459
So sharing that may actually be beneficial.

933
00:55:13,866 --> 00:55:16,948
So you may want to reach out to PR,

934
00:55:17,028 --> 00:55:20,530
which is our person called James Bafford, to see.

935
00:55:20,931 --> 00:55:21,731
Okay, thank you so much.

936
00:55:21,751 --> 00:55:26,554
All right, I think that's the end of questions.

937
00:55:28,685 --> 00:55:31,727
Once again, thank you for coming to the Psychonauts 2 Talk.
