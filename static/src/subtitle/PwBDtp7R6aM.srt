1
00:00:02,824 --> 00:00:06,806
Hello everyone.

2
00:00:06,806 --> 00:00:19,493
My name is Koushi Nakanishi, director of REGNATIVE 7.

3
00:00:19,493 --> 00:00:22,995
Thanks for being here, but I can't speak English.

4
00:00:22,995 --> 00:00:24,836
You are speaking English now!

5
00:00:24,836 --> 00:00:28,759
So, here's Peter.

6
00:00:34,687 --> 00:00:36,873
Thank you very much, Koshi.

7
00:00:36,873 --> 00:00:37,996
My name is Pete Fabiano.

8
00:00:37,996 --> 00:00:41,547
Some of you may know me as the guy who doesn't do ADR.

9
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:46,601
Others in the room will know me as Pete Fabiano,

10
00:00:46,601 --> 00:00:49,642
Senior Manager of Global R&D.

11
00:00:49,642 --> 00:00:52,462
My team and I handled a bit of the production

12
00:00:52,462 --> 00:00:55,183
for this project, but that's not what we're here

13
00:00:55,183 --> 00:00:56,123
to talk about today.

14
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:59,784
Today we're here to discuss, well I'm here speaking

15
00:00:59,784 --> 00:01:02,665
on Koshi's behalf to discuss the vision

16
00:01:02,665 --> 00:01:04,706
and approach we took with RE7.

17
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:12,103
So as most of you are aware, Resident Evil is known as biohazard in Japan.

18
00:01:12,103 --> 00:01:17,426
So for this title, we consolidated the names and made the western name Resident Evil a

19
00:01:17,426 --> 00:01:21,848
subtitle in Japan and vice versa overseas.

20
00:01:21,848 --> 00:01:29,472
Internally, we nicknamed the project Harawata, which roughly translates as entrails or guts.

21
00:01:29,472 --> 00:01:34,395
It also happens to be, however, part of the name for evil dead in Japanese.

22
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:44,396
So, quick show of hands, who in the room has actually played Resident Evil 7 in some form or another?

23
00:01:45,536 --> 00:01:49,358
Wow, oh wait, me too.

24
00:01:49,358 --> 00:01:53,200
Okay, well then most of you know what we're getting into.

25
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,682
For this series we took a new direction, in part by changing the camera to first person

26
00:01:58,682 --> 00:02:02,104
and keeping a strong focus on survival horror.

27
00:02:02,104 --> 00:02:05,905
And we're not just saying that, we did actually try to do that.

28
00:02:05,905 --> 00:02:09,647
I'd like to start by playing a brief clip to help set the stage

29
00:02:09,647 --> 00:02:11,408
and visually demonstrate what we accomplished.

30
00:02:32,475 --> 00:02:33,676
What the fuck?

31
00:02:33,676 --> 00:02:34,016
What is that?

32
00:02:34,016 --> 00:02:35,338
What the fuck are you talking about?

33
00:02:35,338 --> 00:02:37,139
So we weren't really sure how all this would be received.

34
00:02:37,139 --> 00:02:41,042
As developers, we wanted to keep true to our creative vision, but how would fans and the

35
00:02:41,042 --> 00:02:41,803
public respond?

36
00:02:43,354 --> 00:02:47,397
Overall, we were pretty pleased with the public reception

37
00:02:47,397 --> 00:02:50,299
from industry, media, and customer feedback.

38
00:02:50,299 --> 00:02:54,342
Players were happy with the overall direction we took,

39
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:56,824
and we got positive commentary on the atmosphere

40
00:02:56,824 --> 00:02:58,425
and the world that we tried to create.

41
00:02:58,425 --> 00:03:01,227
So let's go back to the beginning, where it all started.

42
00:03:01,227 --> 00:03:01,687
Osaka, 2014.

43
00:03:01,687 --> 00:03:02,748
So how do you iterate on the RE franchise?

44
00:03:13,132 --> 00:03:18,254
Well, you get two seasoned RE veterans, Jun Takeuchi and Koshi, to my left here,

45
00:03:18,254 --> 00:03:21,595
who would ultimately act as executive producer, that's Jun Takeuchi,

46
00:03:21,595 --> 00:03:22,955
and of course, the director here, Koshi.

47
00:03:22,955 --> 00:03:24,456
This is when we first discussed the new direction

48
00:03:24,456 --> 00:03:27,717
and started early stages in building the team.

49
00:03:27,717 --> 00:03:31,478
So Takeuchi delivered his general vision for the title.

50
00:03:31,478 --> 00:03:32,738
I mean, how are we going to take the brand forward?

51
00:03:43,055 --> 00:03:47,396
The answer? Horror.

52
00:03:47,396 --> 00:03:48,276
Yeah.

53
00:03:48,276 --> 00:03:51,998
Sure. Could you be a bit more specific?

54
00:03:51,998 --> 00:03:56,419
Yeah. So here we have the four mandates that he established.

55
00:03:56,419 --> 00:03:59,200
Tone along the lines of Evil Dead.

56
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,522
First person perspective to keep players more immersed.

57
00:04:03,522 --> 00:04:06,603
And we coupled that with photorealism to give it more of a realistic feeling.

58
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:07,283
And no co-op.

59
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:11,844
He felt that we should keep the experience more personal.

60
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,781
and thus make it single player.

61
00:04:14,781 --> 00:04:18,803
And finally, references to past characters, etc.,

62
00:04:18,803 --> 00:04:21,964
should be kept to a minimum or subdued.

63
00:04:21,964 --> 00:04:25,146
If you're into horror,

64
00:04:25,146 --> 00:04:28,047
then I'm sure you're familiar with Evil Dead.

65
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:31,049
So what did we extrapolate from that film?

66
00:04:31,049 --> 00:04:32,149
Well, first off,

67
00:04:32,149 --> 00:04:35,111
we wanted to keep the number of characters to a minimum.

68
00:04:35,111 --> 00:04:36,912
We settle on about five main villains.

69
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,042
We knew that we were going up against other AAA blockbuster titles,

70
00:04:43,042 --> 00:04:45,543
so we needed to be efficient in our approach

71
00:04:45,543 --> 00:04:50,386
in order to keep budgets in check and still maintain a high level of interest and quality.

72
00:04:50,386 --> 00:04:56,529
We kept the feeling of confinement by limiting the majority of the game to an old home.

73
00:04:56,529 --> 00:05:02,151
This helped us to keep set pieces narrow and feeling semi-claustrophobic.

74
00:05:02,151 --> 00:05:07,414
In addition, this all contributed to the way players would approach the game

75
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,494
and help capture the mood.

76
00:05:11,247 --> 00:05:15,409
You can think of the RE series almost as a series of trilogies.

77
00:05:15,409 --> 00:05:18,871
One in three had fixed cameras in gameplay,

78
00:05:18,871 --> 00:05:22,092
and that created a feeling of helplessness or challenge

79
00:05:22,092 --> 00:05:24,233
to keep players scared or anxious.

80
00:05:24,233 --> 00:05:29,236
Four through six changed focus to third person,

81
00:05:29,236 --> 00:05:31,998
and they gave us new types of enemies

82
00:05:31,998 --> 00:05:34,959
to match the new direction in gameplay.

83
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,880
Now with seven, we wanted to keep

84
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:39,482
the tradition of adapting certain elements and direction

85
00:05:39,482 --> 00:05:40,662
to make things feel fresh.

86
00:05:41,666 --> 00:05:46,348
Two major components in this approach were photo realism and first person.

87
00:05:46,348 --> 00:05:48,108
As we mentioned, our focus was to be on the player experience.

88
00:05:48,108 --> 00:05:52,110
In this case, one that focused on horror.

89
00:05:52,110 --> 00:06:02,354
To accomplish this, we brought the game back to single player and moved away from familiar series characters.

90
00:06:03,607 --> 00:06:06,009
In order to concentrate on the horror aspect,

91
00:06:06,009 --> 00:06:09,391
we needed to keep the scope of the game somewhat narrow.

92
00:06:09,391 --> 00:06:11,873
We didn't want an expansive playing field

93
00:06:11,873 --> 00:06:13,234
or to have too much clutter

94
00:06:13,234 --> 00:06:15,396
around the single-player experience.

95
00:06:15,396 --> 00:06:17,658
The team agreed that we needed to keep away

96
00:06:17,658 --> 00:06:19,099
from a focus on the main characters.

97
00:06:19,099 --> 00:06:22,061
In other words, we didn't want this to turn into a game

98
00:06:22,061 --> 00:06:24,163
driven by the protagonist's story, per se,

99
00:06:24,163 --> 00:06:26,685
but more so on the player experience itself.

100
00:06:26,685 --> 00:06:27,786
So going back to Takuchi for a moment,

101
00:06:27,786 --> 00:06:32,470
he gave us a very simple vision for the project.

102
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,550
Make the game scary and fun.

103
00:06:34,550 --> 00:06:34,830
Really?

104
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,070
Seriously?

105
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:35,150
Yeah.

106
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:38,151
So yeah, something tells me Koshi wasn't quite as cavalier

107
00:06:38,151 --> 00:06:42,632
when he heard the news, but he thought to himself,

108
00:06:42,632 --> 00:06:45,513
no way, you're gonna let me run with just that?

109
00:06:45,513 --> 00:06:50,254
But he was certainly up for the challenge.

110
00:06:50,254 --> 00:06:53,375
Truth be told, this wasn't something

111
00:06:53,375 --> 00:06:54,335
that came about spur of the moment.

112
00:07:00,162 --> 00:07:04,225
As a company, we had been throwing around ideas as to where to take the franchise.

113
00:07:04,225 --> 00:07:12,391
This came after careful consideration, especially regarding the next phase in the franchise

114
00:07:12,391 --> 00:07:12,712
life cycle.

115
00:07:12,712 --> 00:07:16,254
Koshi himself had been doing some soul searching.

116
00:07:16,254 --> 00:07:19,917
He knew we needed to redefine the brand.

117
00:07:19,917 --> 00:07:26,322
And now we had the general direction that we needed to take and he got now finally the

118
00:07:26,322 --> 00:07:27,343
ability to take it there.

119
00:07:29,416 --> 00:07:32,339
With that in mind, we had to go over brand identity.

120
00:07:32,339 --> 00:07:34,541
What makes Resident Evil, Resident Evil?

121
00:07:34,541 --> 00:07:38,866
I mean, how do you describe the game to people?

122
00:07:38,866 --> 00:07:44,031
For us, it was fun, atmospheric, scary.

123
00:07:44,031 --> 00:07:45,512
We needed to make sure though,

124
00:07:45,512 --> 00:07:48,375
that RE differentiated itself from competitors.

125
00:07:51,259 --> 00:07:53,821
So staying true to our newly defined vision,

126
00:07:53,821 --> 00:07:56,283
we set out to begin planning and designing

127
00:07:56,283 --> 00:07:58,245
and putting together a design document

128
00:07:58,245 --> 00:07:59,947
in order to reach our end goal.

129
00:07:59,947 --> 00:08:04,311
Probably most important focal point

130
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:08,695
was attempting to achieve the same impact or feeling

131
00:08:08,695 --> 00:08:10,657
that players had the first time they picked up

132
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,139
and played the original RE.

133
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:14,881
Particularly the first one

134
00:08:14,881 --> 00:08:16,403
and its iconic atmosphere and imagery.

135
00:08:19,842 --> 00:08:23,303
So what did we have in the original RE that defined it?

136
00:08:23,303 --> 00:08:26,925
Well, you had unfamiliar surroundings.

137
00:08:26,925 --> 00:08:27,465
Where were you?

138
00:08:27,465 --> 00:08:30,347
Everything you encountered was new,

139
00:08:30,347 --> 00:08:32,708
and neither you nor the characters knew what was going on.

140
00:08:32,708 --> 00:08:34,909
Interesting enemies.

141
00:08:34,909 --> 00:08:38,851
Everyone remembers the first time you see the camera pan

142
00:08:38,851 --> 00:08:42,233
to what appears to be a zombie, and it turns towards you.

143
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,153
Were you fighting with the undead?

144
00:08:43,153 --> 00:08:44,074
Players didn't know who they were.

145
00:08:49,055 --> 00:08:53,177
Sure, you heard the stars' names, but the characters weren't that developed.

146
00:08:53,177 --> 00:08:57,378
They were new, and you didn't know who to trust.

147
00:08:57,378 --> 00:08:58,458
Would you ever even make it out of this place alive?

148
00:08:58,458 --> 00:09:04,100
You'll notice the goal here was to tie in a lot of unknowns.

149
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:06,581
Who, what, where, how.

150
00:09:06,581 --> 00:09:15,883
All this contributes to giving off feelings of anxiety

151
00:09:15,883 --> 00:09:17,564
and ultimately, fear.

152
00:09:24,163 --> 00:09:31,666
For the new direction, we wanted to create that same sense, or create a sense of unknown.

153
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:38,649
So we chose a setting, a new setting in Louisiana, with an unfamiliar main character and a new mystery.

154
00:09:38,649 --> 00:09:43,612
The sense of new and unknown continues with our enemy design.

155
00:09:43,612 --> 00:09:48,514
With photorealism, our characters could display vivid expressions.

156
00:09:48,514 --> 00:09:52,936
We could have them perform unexpected and grotesque actions.

157
00:09:54,076 --> 00:09:56,998
And this leads to psychologically taxing situations,

158
00:09:56,998 --> 00:10:00,720
a sort of psychological roller coaster.

159
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,642
Not knowing what to expect kept situations tense

160
00:10:04,642 --> 00:10:07,424
and players often trying to keep their guards up

161
00:10:07,424 --> 00:10:08,404
and sometimes failing.

162
00:10:08,404 --> 00:10:12,707
With RE, level designs focused on enclosed areas

163
00:10:12,707 --> 00:10:15,128
where you collect ammo and solve puzzles,

164
00:10:15,128 --> 00:10:16,970
all with the intention of opening up new areas

165
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:17,950
and moving forward.

166
00:10:18,875 --> 00:10:22,397
This was accomplished with either linear, or what we call tube style design,

167
00:10:22,397 --> 00:10:26,079
or through more Metroidvania like progression.

168
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:27,240
We kept this for RE7 as well.

169
00:10:27,240 --> 00:10:28,480
Welcome to the family everyone.

170
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:31,502
Since we wanted to keep to four or five main villains,

171
00:10:31,502 --> 00:10:37,186
the less is more approach, we thought a good way to bring it all together

172
00:10:37,186 --> 00:10:43,329
would be to make them a family.

173
00:10:43,329 --> 00:10:45,170
Now we had some of the general ingredients we needed.

174
00:10:47,093 --> 00:10:52,835
So we needed to review some of the issues we felt existed with making a horror game.

175
00:10:52,835 --> 00:10:58,137
One of the main problems we discovered is that people get used to being scared pretty

176
00:10:58,137 --> 00:11:03,100
quickly, especially if you can guess what's coming.

177
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:06,801
We thought that in RE, players overcame their fears by laying waste to enemies.

178
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:08,882
This is the catharsis point.

179
00:11:08,882 --> 00:11:12,123
Once the unfamiliar grows and...

180
00:11:12,545 --> 00:11:15,185
and then it becomes familiar or common,

181
00:11:15,185 --> 00:11:19,966
people adapt and learn how to overcome their fears.

182
00:11:19,966 --> 00:11:24,627
So we decided to shake things up a little bit.

183
00:11:24,627 --> 00:11:27,447
We incorporated elements of the horror sub-genres

184
00:11:27,447 --> 00:11:29,007
into each of the family members.

185
00:11:29,007 --> 00:11:31,988
There's a multitude of categories here,

186
00:11:31,988 --> 00:11:34,528
so without going into too many details,

187
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:38,829
we can say that Margaret, or the mother character,

188
00:11:38,829 --> 00:11:41,590
for her, we took elements of body or natural horror.

189
00:11:42,328 --> 00:11:44,669
Limbs exaggerate as she mutates.

190
00:11:44,669 --> 00:11:48,350
Centipedes emerge from her body.

191
00:11:48,350 --> 00:11:54,732
With Jack, the father character, we included elements of slasher films.

192
00:11:54,732 --> 00:11:58,453
Lucas, a slice from psychological horror, and so on and so forth.

193
00:11:58,453 --> 00:12:03,935
We still needed to overcome our perceived issues with horror, though.

194
00:12:03,935 --> 00:12:10,256
And the easiest or simplest, at least in terms of theory, not execution, was immersion.

195
00:12:11,445 --> 00:12:15,588
How do we make players feel like they're in this world or situation?

196
00:12:15,588 --> 00:12:18,611
We already mentioned first-person and photorealism,

197
00:12:18,611 --> 00:12:22,054
but adding to that we wanted to have a level of believability,

198
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:24,576
while limiting the characterization around the main character.

199
00:12:24,576 --> 00:12:27,078
And of course, one final piece to the immersion puzzle was to include VR.

200
00:12:27,078 --> 00:12:30,762
So what are some of the things we actively removed or chose to avoid?

201
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,873
To keep our overall vision of scary and fun while staying true to the defined RE identity,

202
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:51,177
we felt that we needed to exclude familiar characters, action elements, co-op, zombies,

203
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:53,959
any type of over-the-top blockbuster type film.

204
00:12:53,959 --> 00:13:00,463
Including these would run counter to our goals or at the very best make them difficult to

205
00:13:00,463 --> 00:13:01,304
achieve.

206
00:13:01,304 --> 00:13:04,766
Now we are finally starting to get closer to actually building something.

207
00:13:05,388 --> 00:13:08,269
We got our direction, our ideas, our definitions,

208
00:13:08,269 --> 00:13:11,430
but what do fans like about the series?

209
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:12,270
So over our 20 years with the franchise,

210
00:13:12,270 --> 00:13:17,352
we've gotten feedback that tells us

211
00:13:17,352 --> 00:13:20,112
what the fans have liked across the timeline.

212
00:13:20,112 --> 00:13:23,854
You've got characters, story, a sense of fear,

213
00:13:23,854 --> 00:13:27,055
foreboding, puzzles, taking down enemies,

214
00:13:27,055 --> 00:13:30,055
particularly in co-op, zombies, creatures,

215
00:13:30,055 --> 00:13:33,396
all of the stuff that comes with RE and fixed cameras.

216
00:13:34,534 --> 00:13:36,276
But not all fans are created equal.

217
00:13:36,276 --> 00:13:37,638
And most importantly, you can't have it all.

218
00:13:37,638 --> 00:13:39,541
So here's something Koshi believes about creating or building a commercial product.

219
00:13:39,541 --> 00:13:42,504
Complete with visual references of what you get when you pack everything together.

220
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,442
As you can see, making something no one hates

221
00:13:55,442 --> 00:13:57,945
means also making something that no one loves.

222
00:13:57,945 --> 00:14:00,367
You'll remember potentially that Simpsons episode

223
00:14:00,367 --> 00:14:02,669
where Homer made a car for the everyman,

224
00:14:02,669 --> 00:14:04,590
and it ended up being for everyone

225
00:14:04,590 --> 00:14:05,952
and no one at the same time.

226
00:14:05,952 --> 00:14:06,832
Here's a little bit more philosophy.

227
00:14:06,832 --> 00:14:12,437
Deciding what to do means also deciding what not to do.

228
00:14:12,437 --> 00:14:17,361
And so with that, we completed our game design doc

229
00:14:17,361 --> 00:14:19,263
and moved forward.

230
00:14:19,263 --> 00:14:21,545
Which takes us to presenting that to you.

231
00:14:22,473 --> 00:14:25,195
The guy seated in the front row, maybe.

232
00:14:25,195 --> 00:14:27,557
Marketing, yeah.

233
00:14:27,557 --> 00:14:30,380
So how did they respond?

234
00:14:30,380 --> 00:14:32,922
Well, all companies and publisher-developer

235
00:14:32,922 --> 00:14:34,484
relationships are different.

236
00:14:34,484 --> 00:14:35,685
Some are contentious.

237
00:14:35,685 --> 00:14:36,926
Some are friendly.

238
00:14:36,926 --> 00:14:38,627
For us, when we presented it to them,

239
00:14:38,627 --> 00:14:40,689
we didn't get much pushback.

240
00:14:40,689 --> 00:14:42,751
However, it was very easy to come up

241
00:14:42,751 --> 00:14:45,273
with reasons for failure or risk.

242
00:14:45,273 --> 00:14:48,336
This was especially true as we were going

243
00:14:48,336 --> 00:14:49,497
through the approval process.

244
00:14:51,980 --> 00:14:55,241
From our perspective, marketing liked our design and direction.

245
00:14:55,241 --> 00:15:00,584
Their major concern was determining where the brand fit into the market.

246
00:15:00,584 --> 00:15:04,365
After all, we were trying to make something old, but new.

247
00:15:04,365 --> 00:15:11,468
Lucky for our devs, however, our chairman, Big T, lover of baseball,

248
00:15:11,468 --> 00:15:12,569
puts a lot of trust into our teams.

249
00:15:12,569 --> 00:15:16,971
He truly believes that they're capable of making something good

250
00:15:16,971 --> 00:15:18,131
and encourages them to do so.

251
00:15:19,624 --> 00:15:21,324
He didn't actually say that.

252
00:15:21,324 --> 00:15:22,305
No, he did.

253
00:15:22,305 --> 00:15:25,245
How did the team react though?

254
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:27,726
I think that's a point that we need to explore.

255
00:15:27,726 --> 00:15:30,727
Well, we took a lot of criticism to heart.

256
00:15:30,727 --> 00:15:33,447
We knew we needed to appeal to our base,

257
00:15:33,447 --> 00:15:36,108
so we needed to look more into the details of our approach.

258
00:15:36,108 --> 00:15:39,509
Wanted to have something as fresh and memorable

259
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:41,449
as the Christopher Nolan Batman films.

260
00:15:42,382 --> 00:15:44,523
However, the important point to consider

261
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:47,044
is that we didn't want to reboot the series.

262
00:15:47,044 --> 00:15:51,145
We wanted to move it forward in its next natural stage.

263
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:52,266
So following through with our aims,

264
00:15:52,266 --> 00:15:55,267
we broke down our targets and wanted to ensure

265
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:56,827
that we were making something

266
00:15:56,827 --> 00:15:58,568
that our fans would be happy with.

267
00:15:58,568 --> 00:16:00,388
It's all theory and data,

268
00:16:00,388 --> 00:16:03,730
but at least it helped us to create goals

269
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,690
and move towards them.

270
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:15,863
One of our other goals became moving towards action via gameplay

271
00:16:15,863 --> 00:16:17,984
rather than the shooting mechanics.

272
00:16:17,984 --> 00:16:22,467
But there are already some great games out there that are scary.

273
00:16:22,467 --> 00:16:26,450
Again, we needed to differentiate ourselves.

274
00:16:26,450 --> 00:16:31,993
We needed what the Japanese refer to as the fifth sense of taste.

275
00:16:31,993 --> 00:16:32,573
The umami.

276
00:16:37,596 --> 00:16:41,901
So Koshi asked the teams to write up some mock reviews.

277
00:16:41,901 --> 00:16:43,943
What would people say about our title?

278
00:16:43,943 --> 00:16:46,486
Here's a general summary of what they wrote.

279
00:16:46,486 --> 00:16:47,828
Excuse me for a moment.

280
00:16:49,990 --> 00:16:54,633
Resident Evil 7 trades the massive scale and unrivaled variety of the previous installments

281
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:57,555
for a return to the magic of the original Resident Evil.

282
00:16:57,555 --> 00:17:02,959
Though the game's theme and plotline hint at classic RE tropes, RE7 has largely discarded

283
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,222
its ongoing virus-centric story and familiar characters, which might be a disappointment

284
00:17:07,222 --> 00:17:08,483
to some fans.

285
00:17:08,483 --> 00:17:13,146
However, the development team should be commended for meeting and exceeding the high expectations

286
00:17:13,146 --> 00:17:17,069
of the current market, and we were left with high hopes for the future of the series.

287
00:17:19,113 --> 00:17:22,375
so they were trying to predict the future and be hopeful.

288
00:17:22,375 --> 00:17:26,579
And with that, we finally started building.

289
00:17:26,579 --> 00:17:30,241
We had to get in the right mindset.

290
00:17:30,241 --> 00:17:33,684
We couldn't make something scary

291
00:17:33,684 --> 00:17:36,927
without feeling or knowing fear ourselves.

292
00:17:36,927 --> 00:17:39,569
So like it or not, he and the team set out

293
00:17:39,569 --> 00:17:43,071
to find urban legends, watch horror films,

294
00:17:43,071 --> 00:17:45,513
head to haunted mansions, et cetera, et cetera.

295
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,561
Koshi heard that the Uncharted team, though,

296
00:17:48,561 --> 00:17:51,923
they got to go to a desert while making their game.

297
00:17:51,923 --> 00:17:53,865
We only got to drive 30 minutes

298
00:17:53,865 --> 00:17:56,846
to an abandoned location nearby.

299
00:17:56,846 --> 00:17:59,048
Something tells me we got the short end of the stick.

300
00:18:01,156 --> 00:18:05,537
Except he forgot that we actually got to go to Louisiana

301
00:18:05,537 --> 00:18:09,317
and film quite a bunch of stuff for reference.

302
00:18:09,317 --> 00:18:10,878
We got some wonderful stuff out there.

303
00:18:10,878 --> 00:18:14,878
We got to travel to plantations, to museums,

304
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:18,419
to all sorts of locations that really helped

305
00:18:18,419 --> 00:18:20,839
to capture some of the realism that we were going for.

306
00:18:20,839 --> 00:18:23,320
Except that I think he forgot about that

307
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,440
because unfortunately he was at home building the game.

308
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:25,560
Anyway.

309
00:18:29,822 --> 00:18:32,644
While doing all of this, something happened.

310
00:18:32,644 --> 00:18:34,886
Some team members, they just didn't get Evil Dead.

311
00:18:34,886 --> 00:18:38,188
They couldn't understand what made it interesting or fun.

312
00:18:38,188 --> 00:18:40,569
So Koshi had to put things in perspective.

313
00:18:40,569 --> 00:18:41,150
It was kind of like this.

314
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,371
It's a classic film that Sam Raimi made on a low budget.

315
00:18:43,371 --> 00:18:44,612
Think about that.

316
00:18:44,612 --> 00:18:45,072
Be Sam Raimi.

317
00:18:45,072 --> 00:18:49,215
So we managed to set the mood and the mindset of the team.

318
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:49,856
Now it's time to create.

319
00:18:57,879 --> 00:19:01,042
Internally, we decided to go with our new engine,

320
00:19:01,042 --> 00:19:03,204
ultimately what came to be known as the RE engine,

321
00:19:03,204 --> 00:19:04,786
but it wasn't ready yet.

322
00:19:04,786 --> 00:19:07,128
So we started building our gray box in Unity.

323
00:19:07,128 --> 00:19:08,550
Here's some samples for you guys to take a look at.

324
00:19:33,926 --> 00:19:40,369
We didn't really care too much about making things cohesive or organized.

325
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:44,631
We just wanted to see our ideas come to life during the look dev process.

326
00:19:44,631 --> 00:19:50,253
So when building out the gray box, we had a few basic mantras.

327
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:51,033
No lengthy docs.

328
00:19:51,033 --> 00:19:54,515
Any interesting idea was valid.

329
00:19:54,515 --> 00:19:58,517
And anyone and everyone should have the opportunity to realize their ideas.

330
00:20:05,065 --> 00:20:08,849
It was important that everyone consider the game as a whole.

331
00:20:08,849 --> 00:20:12,292
So we tried to remove any type of segregation or barriers

332
00:20:12,292 --> 00:20:16,517
and encouraged people to expand beyond their official roles.

333
00:20:16,517 --> 00:20:18,959
It didn't matter whether you were the audio director

334
00:20:18,959 --> 00:20:22,363
or the art director or whatever,

335
00:20:22,363 --> 00:20:23,765
you were free to discuss design.

336
00:20:27,516 --> 00:20:30,778
During pre-production, we employed agile development,

337
00:20:30,778 --> 00:20:33,120
we broke teams down into small groups,

338
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:36,242
we wanted to make sure that goals were defined,

339
00:20:36,242 --> 00:20:39,845
and we created an environment where it really felt

340
00:20:39,845 --> 00:20:41,766
like a number of individual indie teams

341
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:42,747
working amongst the larger team.

342
00:20:42,747 --> 00:20:45,449
We took things a step further,

343
00:20:45,449 --> 00:20:48,251
where we divided them into father, mother, brother,

344
00:20:48,251 --> 00:20:50,093
and grandma plus, meaning anything else

345
00:20:50,093 --> 00:20:51,394
outside of the grandma.

346
00:20:51,394 --> 00:20:57,038
Kind of all to strengthen teamwork and bonds.

347
00:21:00,310 --> 00:21:01,451
Because we didn't have a fleshed out story or scenario,

348
00:21:01,451 --> 00:21:04,892
we were able to create some interesting pieces

349
00:21:04,892 --> 00:21:05,992
that we actually used in the game.

350
00:21:05,992 --> 00:21:08,333
Unfortunately, this did not come without its drawbacks.

351
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:09,373
Because we didn't have that,

352
00:21:22,564 --> 00:21:27,488
Some things were left straying off course, confused.

353
00:21:27,488 --> 00:21:32,492
Some members didn't respond to this well.

354
00:21:32,492 --> 00:21:34,914
And in Koshi's words, sometimes it was just utter chaos.

355
00:21:34,914 --> 00:21:37,437
But as it says here, passion is important.

356
00:21:37,437 --> 00:21:39,158
And let me play you a clip of one of the things

357
00:21:39,158 --> 00:21:43,121
that was a result of what we did in pre-production.

358
00:21:43,121 --> 00:21:43,662
It's fucking hard!

359
00:22:06,350 --> 00:22:08,290
The scene early on where you get your hand cut off

360
00:22:08,290 --> 00:22:11,131
was the result of our art director lamenting over the fact

361
00:22:11,131 --> 00:22:13,092
that there wasn't enough punch in the early scenes.

362
00:22:13,092 --> 00:22:15,533
So Koshi thought that we'd certainly

363
00:22:15,533 --> 00:22:16,774
make things interesting,

364
00:22:16,774 --> 00:22:18,514
but how would players come back from that?

365
00:22:18,514 --> 00:22:20,715
Then he remembered something that the author

366
00:22:20,715 --> 00:22:22,095
of the Death Note series said.

367
00:22:22,095 --> 00:22:24,756
Take your hero into a situation

368
00:22:24,756 --> 00:22:27,257
that even you can't figure a way out of,

369
00:22:27,257 --> 00:22:28,078
and work from there.

370
00:22:28,078 --> 00:22:30,318
So the team ran with it.

371
00:22:30,318 --> 00:22:33,160
The art director also had another idea.

372
00:22:34,025 --> 00:22:36,126
He wanted to have the character lose his lower half

373
00:22:36,126 --> 00:22:37,206
and start crawling his way towards one of the safe rooms.

374
00:22:37,206 --> 00:22:38,187
Yeah, we didn't use that one.

375
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,247
So finally, we made it into full production.

376
00:22:39,247 --> 00:22:40,228
All right, we've got our engine

377
00:22:40,228 --> 00:22:40,868
and we're ready to do this for real.

378
00:22:40,868 --> 00:22:43,189
Why did we make the engine in the first place?

379
00:23:00,477 --> 00:23:03,260
Well, since it was customized with the ARRI in mind,

380
00:23:03,260 --> 00:23:06,362
we of course needed to make enhancements in photogrammetry.

381
00:23:06,362 --> 00:23:08,224
But we also wanted it to push what we could do,

382
00:23:08,224 --> 00:23:09,685
not only technologically,

383
00:23:09,685 --> 00:23:12,147
but also make our teams be able to produce more

384
00:23:12,147 --> 00:23:13,248
in a more efficient way.

385
00:23:13,248 --> 00:23:14,649
This would make things easier for all of us.

386
00:23:14,649 --> 00:23:16,811
We couldn't continue doing things in full production

387
00:23:16,811 --> 00:23:18,012
in the same way we did in pre-production.

388
00:23:18,012 --> 00:23:18,453
So we made a few key changes.

389
00:23:29,266 --> 00:23:34,490
Reviews would happen early and before we implemented ideas.

390
00:23:34,490 --> 00:23:36,932
We moved to a waterfall system and carefully thought

391
00:23:36,932 --> 00:23:40,654
about how we would incorporate the good ideas

392
00:23:40,654 --> 00:23:42,636
that were born out of pre-production,

393
00:23:42,636 --> 00:23:43,396
like what I just mentioned.

394
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:47,079
The overall dev process worked something more traditional,

395
00:23:47,079 --> 00:23:51,563
like build, review, revise, iterate,

396
00:23:51,563 --> 00:23:52,703
rinse and repeat kind of stuff.

397
00:23:56,674 --> 00:24:01,756
So Tal Gujasan's back, this time with some ominous yet encouraging words.

398
00:24:01,756 --> 00:24:07,157
He wanted Koshi and the team to really push things, make something special.

399
00:24:07,157 --> 00:24:11,579
Except there's one other thing that he really, really wanted them to do.

400
00:24:11,579 --> 00:24:12,259
Not delay the game.

401
00:24:12,259 --> 00:24:13,799
So ship dates would not change.

402
00:24:13,799 --> 00:24:14,439
With that...

403
00:24:25,670 --> 00:24:29,833
We started to change things up and try to make things interesting.

404
00:24:29,833 --> 00:24:32,496
We wanted to actually bring things forward even more.

405
00:24:32,496 --> 00:24:33,517
So, what could we do?

406
00:24:33,517 --> 00:24:38,501
One of the ideas was the split paths with Zoe and Mia.

407
00:24:38,501 --> 00:24:41,224
Keeping with the scope of less is more,

408
00:24:41,224 --> 00:24:43,386
and our fast approaching deadlines,

409
00:24:43,386 --> 00:24:46,148
we wanted to have something that made players feel

410
00:24:46,148 --> 00:24:47,729
like they were making a critical decision,

411
00:24:47,729 --> 00:24:50,292
but also something that wouldn't be so involved

412
00:24:50,292 --> 00:24:51,453
that it would delay the project.

413
00:24:52,693 --> 00:24:56,376
We settled on having the decision affect part of the story,

414
00:24:56,376 --> 00:24:57,857
even though the outcomes led the player

415
00:24:57,857 --> 00:24:59,399
into more or less the same direction.

416
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:00,540
The chainsaw battle with Jack was another example

417
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,121
of a design decision that would be a challenge,

418
00:25:02,121 --> 00:25:03,643
but also something that left a strong impression.

419
00:25:03,643 --> 00:25:05,744
Knowing our limitations helped the team

420
00:25:05,744 --> 00:25:08,106
to get more creative in their approach.

421
00:25:08,106 --> 00:25:09,888
We kept things positive and set our sights on the goal.

422
00:25:27,512 --> 00:25:31,993
So Koshi felt the need to sometimes ignore common ideologies

423
00:25:31,993 --> 00:25:33,094
with regards to level design.

424
00:25:33,094 --> 00:25:35,034
Take the jack character, for example.

425
00:25:35,034 --> 00:25:36,675
In traditional design, you would have a learning curve,

426
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:38,315
carefully teaching players how to use weapons.

427
00:25:38,315 --> 00:25:41,256
Though with our jack battle, players are given a chainsaw

428
00:25:41,256 --> 00:25:43,416
and expected to fight immediately.

429
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:45,777
In another battle, you have a knife and a gun,

430
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:47,557
and both are fairly ineffective against him.

431
00:25:57,890 --> 00:26:02,394
So your last resort is to get in a car and try something there.

432
00:26:02,394 --> 00:26:05,676
Jack himself, both physically and gameplay-wise,

433
00:26:05,676 --> 00:26:06,597
transforms.

434
00:26:06,597 --> 00:26:10,100
And the only consistent piece is that he's still just batshit

435
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,421
crazy.

436
00:26:12,421 --> 00:26:15,083
Getting this to work was a very arduous process.

437
00:26:15,083 --> 00:26:16,645
And Koshi is indebted to the team

438
00:26:16,645 --> 00:26:18,366
for doing their best to work against the conventional

439
00:26:18,366 --> 00:26:18,566
wisdom.

440
00:26:18,566 --> 00:26:19,647
So were the devs scared?

441
00:26:27,665 --> 00:26:30,367
Yeah, yeah, we were scared at first.

442
00:26:30,367 --> 00:26:35,130
And then we got numb to it, and then worried.

443
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,211
And then we tried changing stuff

444
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:39,092
because we thought it wasn't good.

445
00:26:39,092 --> 00:26:43,375
And then we got stress, and more stress.

446
00:26:43,375 --> 00:26:47,337
So what was important was to do constant user testing.

447
00:26:47,337 --> 00:26:49,678
We had to make sure that it was objective.

448
00:26:49,678 --> 00:26:51,800
We needed to know that things were scary

449
00:26:51,800 --> 00:26:53,421
and we were starting to get numb to it,

450
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:56,122
so it was important to get an extra set of eyes.

451
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:01,622
See, these are some of the other things that we looked at with user testing.

452
00:27:01,622 --> 00:27:06,086
It was important to keep the balance between that sense of anxiety and fear

453
00:27:06,086 --> 00:27:07,887
and also the sense of calm.

454
00:27:07,887 --> 00:27:10,149
You didn't want too much of one or too much of the other.

455
00:27:10,149 --> 00:27:11,550
Also, the periods of stress.

456
00:27:11,550 --> 00:27:14,433
You didn't want the player constantly stressed,

457
00:27:14,433 --> 00:27:16,615
but you also wanted him to feel that sense of fear.

458
00:27:17,868 --> 00:27:22,190
And of course, balancing the timing of procuring items,

459
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:25,232
or ammo, or guns, that needed to be all balanced out

460
00:27:25,232 --> 00:27:27,273
so you didn't have too much and it was too easy,

461
00:27:27,273 --> 00:27:28,733
or too little and making it too hard.

462
00:27:28,733 --> 00:27:32,035
And very, very important as well,

463
00:27:32,035 --> 00:27:34,536
was motivating the player to make them feel

464
00:27:34,536 --> 00:27:37,778
like they were achieving certain goals and moving forward.

465
00:27:37,778 --> 00:27:43,780
But after all of that, what's the most important thing,

466
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:46,422
or at least in terms of what we think

467
00:27:46,422 --> 00:27:47,522
is the most important thing?

468
00:27:49,425 --> 00:27:51,847
having fun while creating.

469
00:27:51,847 --> 00:27:55,051
I know it sounds cheesy, but it's true.

470
00:27:55,051 --> 00:27:58,634
And yeah, it's important that we laugh a lot.

471
00:27:58,634 --> 00:28:00,857
Right now, the team is back at home, hard at work,

472
00:28:00,857 --> 00:28:02,759
working on some extra DLC,

473
00:28:02,759 --> 00:28:06,663
and trying to implement new ideas into that as well.

474
00:28:06,663 --> 00:28:10,387
We want them to stay as creative as possible

475
00:28:10,387 --> 00:28:12,629
and try new and different interesting ideas.

476
00:28:16,343 --> 00:28:17,985
Next thing we have coming up does use a legacy character.

477
00:28:17,985 --> 00:28:19,225
Hopefully we can turn it into something

478
00:28:19,225 --> 00:28:20,206
that the fans will enjoy.

479
00:28:20,206 --> 00:28:21,587
Oh, and for those of you that didn't raise your hands

480
00:28:21,587 --> 00:28:23,488
at the beginning of this, this is a very important map.

481
00:28:40,731 --> 00:28:43,114
You'll notice it's got a GameStop on it,

482
00:28:43,114 --> 00:28:47,460
and our location, it's about a seven minute walk.

483
00:28:47,460 --> 00:28:49,022
I don't know what I'm saying right now,

484
00:28:49,022 --> 00:28:52,046
but the map is important if you didn't play yet.

485
00:28:54,670 --> 00:29:00,674
And right before we get back to Koshi, we'd like to present to you with a parody video

486
00:29:00,674 --> 00:29:02,535
that we used during our launch party.

487
00:29:02,535 --> 00:29:09,619
This was to really get the devs amped and feel good about what they had done over the

488
00:29:09,619 --> 00:29:11,000
years.

489
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,522
And it's a parody of a Japanese documentary-type program.

490
00:29:13,522 --> 00:29:19,325
So it's about five, six minutes, so please bear with us while we go through it, but just

491
00:29:19,325 --> 00:29:19,966
keep that in mind.

492
00:29:24,488 --> 00:29:26,070
Osaka, Uchihirano.

493
00:29:26,070 --> 00:29:31,636
Here, a team was working on a project to make Capcom's Shoun.

494
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,199
Team Harawatato.

495
00:29:34,199 --> 00:29:39,344
This is the record of their development, full of hardships.

496
00:30:34,490 --> 00:30:40,755
With the aim of thwarting the threat,

497
00:30:40,755 --> 00:30:48,341
the tests showed repeated failures.

498
00:30:48,341 --> 00:30:56,887
Unity was selected as the test environment.

499
00:31:05,748 --> 00:31:13,294
The scene inside the taxi, which is considered as the introduction of the story.

500
00:31:13,294 --> 00:31:17,097
The grand idea of chatting with the driver for 15 minutes is, of course, a sin.

501
00:31:42,137 --> 00:31:45,620
The man with the glasses.

502
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:46,801
Later, he became Jack.

503
00:31:46,801 --> 00:31:52,126
Hey! Hey, you!

504
00:31:52,126 --> 00:31:56,130
What are you doing here?

505
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,371
Please, help me!

506
00:31:57,371 --> 00:31:58,312
What's wrong?

507
00:31:58,312 --> 00:31:58,732
I don't know.

508
00:31:58,732 --> 00:32:00,053
You're too much, old man!

509
00:32:00,053 --> 00:32:04,337
As an actor, he sometimes...

510
00:32:04,337 --> 00:32:06,479
...takes his own body.

511
00:32:16,964 --> 00:32:18,285
The legendary Chapter 2.

512
00:32:18,285 --> 00:32:25,109
A challenging concept just for walking the field...

513
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:29,132
...was crap after all.

514
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:45,672
Reach the Moon.

515
00:32:45,672 --> 00:32:50,536
Finally, a new engine has been rolled out.

516
00:32:50,536 --> 00:32:53,419
The name is RE Engine.

517
00:32:53,419 --> 00:32:54,200
Tragic system changes,

518
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:56,101
Isolate View,

519
00:32:56,101 --> 00:32:58,724
PSVR response,

520
00:32:58,724 --> 00:33:03,789
All of them are a sign of fear.

521
00:33:03,789 --> 00:33:08,853
Is it really okay on this route?

522
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:17,811
Against all their worries, the team hit clocky Scrap-and-Build battles

523
00:33:17,811 --> 00:33:22,915
and kept fighting the journey they believed in together.

524
00:33:22,915 --> 00:33:24,736
That's how we met each other in June 2016.

525
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:25,057
America's men, 5300.

526
00:33:42,747 --> 00:33:46,351
I could feel the audience's applause.

527
00:33:46,351 --> 00:33:48,534
I could do it.

528
00:33:48,534 --> 00:33:52,778
After I felt the response, I just had to run.

529
00:34:37,489 --> 00:34:37,695
Oh

530
00:34:58,714 --> 00:35:01,096
That's right, sir.

531
00:35:01,096 --> 00:35:15,988
I'm gonna buy you plenty of...

532
00:35:15,988 --> 00:35:16,408
Ha!

533
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:16,729
Ha!

534
00:35:16,729 --> 00:35:17,189
Sir!

535
00:36:09,815 --> 00:36:13,777
So in closing, I'd like to leave you with a few words from Koshi himself.

536
00:36:13,777 --> 00:36:15,378
This time we will have translation.

537
00:36:32,337 --> 00:36:38,765
So as all of you have hopefully played, and if not, like Pete said, please go to GameStop and pick up a copy.

538
00:36:38,765 --> 00:36:43,191
But we have successfully launched or shipped our title.

539
00:36:43,191 --> 00:36:49,159
And as you just heard, and with confidence, I can say that we have achieved our vision.

540
00:36:51,177 --> 00:36:58,168
Before and after the release of 7, I think we were able to change the way the franchise was perceived by the public.

541
00:36:58,168 --> 00:37:02,575
Above all, I think we were able to raise expectations for the next development.

542
00:37:03,149 --> 00:37:08,755
So if I could say there's a period before Resident Evil 7 and now that we've released,

543
00:37:08,755 --> 00:37:15,101
after and the future, if I look into the future, I think that we're able to change the perception

544
00:37:15,101 --> 00:37:21,788
or franchise and brand sort of image and we can now take this and carry it into and hopefully

545
00:37:21,788 --> 00:37:24,951
carry it over into whatever comes next for the franchise.

546
00:37:26,553 --> 00:37:34,776
Looking back on the development, the key to success was the simple vision, the team's

547
00:37:34,776 --> 00:37:36,896
dedication, and passion.

548
00:37:36,896 --> 00:37:44,839
And what's important is to have a very simple vision.

549
00:37:44,839 --> 00:37:51,201
Not only that, but to be very faithful to your commitment, the team's commitment, and

550
00:37:51,201 --> 00:37:53,042
also the team's passion.

551
00:37:54,430 --> 00:38:04,957
I would like to thank all the people involved and all the fans.

552
00:38:04,957 --> 00:38:12,562
I feel a sense of high speed right now.

553
00:38:19,218 --> 00:38:32,149
Myself, as for myself, as the person who led the project and as a developer,

554
00:38:32,149 --> 00:38:40,256
I have a great sense of satisfaction and what we were able to achieve.

555
00:38:42,696 --> 00:38:47,818
As you just saw in the video, but it is a parody, please keep in mind.

556
00:38:47,818 --> 00:38:53,700
It's not all fun times with happy faces and smiles all around.

557
00:38:53,700 --> 00:39:09,067
I'm sure you guys have experienced similar things, going through very tough times and challenges.

558
00:39:09,871 --> 00:39:21,741
But I hope you do agree that when you overcome those tough times challenges

559
00:39:21,741 --> 00:39:30,108
with your team and to have this kind of result or to make it to your goal, it is all worth it.

560
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:35,482
And that feeling of overcoming these tough times and challenges,

561
00:39:35,482 --> 00:39:39,064
and times when you don't think you can make it to the goal,

562
00:39:39,064 --> 00:39:42,285
is very similar to what you experience in the game itself.

563
00:39:42,285 --> 00:39:45,107
Thank you for listening.

564
00:39:45,107 --> 00:40:00,673
Thank you for listening.

565
00:40:01,016 --> 00:40:01,617
Can I get the mic on?

566
00:40:01,617 --> 00:40:05,581
So we have about 20 minutes, and we'll open it up to Q&A.

567
00:40:05,581 --> 00:40:09,024
We have two mics, one on each aisle.

568
00:40:09,024 --> 00:40:11,326
So if you could come up and ask the question into the mic.

569
00:40:11,326 --> 00:40:11,707
Is it on?

570
00:40:19,782 --> 00:40:21,966
Here we go, hi.

571
00:40:21,966 --> 00:40:24,109
My name is Dory, I'm from Paradox Interactive

572
00:40:24,109 --> 00:40:26,432
over in Sweden, thank you so much for the presentation,

573
00:40:26,432 --> 00:40:28,235
I really love the game.

574
00:40:28,235 --> 00:40:30,779
Just a question, I know you're in no position

575
00:40:30,779 --> 00:40:33,483
to share any numbers or any of the

576
00:40:33,483 --> 00:40:35,286
not so sexy budget stuff.

577
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:48,757
But I am curious, assuming the return on investment for a project such as this one is better than for a very, very large project such as Resident Evil 6,

578
00:40:48,757 --> 00:40:58,344
what does that mean not only for this franchise, but for maybe all of Capcom's franchises going forward?

579
00:41:01,212 --> 00:41:04,875
I don't think we can tell you the exact number, but...

580
00:41:04,875 --> 00:41:07,216
I think we can give you a rough idea.

581
00:41:07,216 --> 00:41:15,182
If we compare the number of people who participated in the project with the number of people who participated in the original project,

582
00:41:15,182 --> 00:41:20,685
I think the number of people who participated in the original project was much higher.

583
00:41:20,685 --> 00:41:22,827
What are your plans for future projects?

584
00:41:22,827 --> 00:41:23,788
The mic is over there.

585
00:41:23,788 --> 00:41:24,728
Oh, it's not the mic.

586
00:41:25,581 --> 00:41:32,886
Well, as you said, I'm not in a position to give you a specific price.

587
00:41:32,886 --> 00:41:38,651
But as I explained, this project includes the engine.

588
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:41,673
So it's not a simple comparison.

589
00:41:41,673 --> 00:41:47,137
But in terms of development, it's certainly more compact than the 6.

590
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:52,933
Speaking of the future, after we finish building the engine,

591
00:41:52,933 --> 00:41:56,494
we can focus on the game more deeply.

592
00:41:56,494 --> 00:41:59,175
I think we can make better games.

593
00:41:59,175 --> 00:42:07,536
So you're right, I am unable to share any numbers or figures here.

594
00:42:07,536 --> 00:42:12,017
However, one thing to keep in mind for RE7 is that

595
00:42:12,017 --> 00:42:16,238
sort of inclusive of the engine development cost is what we're looking at.

596
00:42:16,979 --> 00:42:23,184
And so it's hard to compare. It's like comparing apples and oranges. So it's hard to say.

597
00:42:23,184 --> 00:42:33,832
But the development cost, you're right, it was a lot more sort of compact in the sense of if you compare just purely numbers, seven versus six.

598
00:42:33,832 --> 00:42:38,816
I can add to that. I mean, as I said in the presentation as well, I mean, we tried to be as efficient as possible.

599
00:42:38,816 --> 00:42:41,938
So we tried to keep things within the budget that we were given.

600
00:42:43,118 --> 00:42:43,899
Here's your answer.

601
00:42:43,899 --> 00:42:45,900
Thank you.

602
00:42:45,900 --> 00:42:46,641
Is that OK?

603
00:42:46,641 --> 00:42:47,321
No, it's fine.

604
00:42:47,321 --> 00:42:48,982
Hi, I just have one quick question

605
00:42:48,982 --> 00:42:52,124
and one a little longer question.

606
00:42:52,124 --> 00:42:56,927
But the first one is, was Texas Chainsaw Massacre

607
00:42:56,927 --> 00:42:58,569
an influence at all?

608
00:42:58,569 --> 00:43:02,671
Because I see quite a bit of that in the parts of the game

609
00:43:02,671 --> 00:43:03,152
anyway.

610
00:43:03,152 --> 00:43:05,713
Was Texas Chainsaw Massacre an influence at all?

611
00:43:05,713 --> 00:43:07,875
Because I see quite a bit of that in the parts of the game anyway.

612
00:43:07,875 --> 00:43:10,697
Well, as I explained earlier today,

613
00:43:10,777 --> 00:43:16,024
The first game I'm going to talk about is Evil Dead.

614
00:43:16,024 --> 00:43:18,868
There are many elements in the game,

615
00:43:18,868 --> 00:43:23,534
and as I said, Texas Chainsaw is one of my favorite games.

616
00:43:23,534 --> 00:43:28,461
There are many other games that I can use as a reference.

617
00:43:29,189 --> 00:43:37,253
So first and foremost, you saw on the slide too, but I guess if we were to call out like the main vision or motif goal that we went for is Evil Dead,

618
00:43:37,253 --> 00:43:41,855
but that doesn't mean that that was the only reference material that we went by.

619
00:43:41,855 --> 00:43:46,497
So obviously Texas Chainsaw Massacre and everything else that you can really think of,

620
00:43:46,497 --> 00:43:52,020
there's a whole sort of wide variety of elements that we pulled inspiration and influence from.

621
00:43:52,020 --> 00:43:54,081
We're huge fans, period.

622
00:43:54,081 --> 00:43:57,162
So there's a lot of influences.

623
00:43:58,403 --> 00:44:00,805
Yes, so, this is a scene from a dinner party.

624
00:44:00,805 --> 00:44:06,449
Actually, the reference video we showed to the team

625
00:44:06,449 --> 00:44:10,432
was not from the Texas war, but a long-term dinner scene.

626
00:44:10,432 --> 00:44:15,115
So, horror movies are the first of the Texas war.

627
00:44:15,115 --> 00:44:21,540
There are a lot of dinner scenes of aliens that we've seen in various movies.

628
00:44:21,540 --> 00:44:25,122
We collected a lot of dinner videos from all over the world

629
00:44:25,122 --> 00:44:27,464
and chose the one that was most suitable for Biohazard.

630
00:44:27,793 --> 00:44:32,498
So to add to that, that whole table dining scene,

631
00:44:32,498 --> 00:44:35,161
the first video or the first scene

632
00:44:35,161 --> 00:44:38,704
that I showed and shared with my friend, I mean my team,

633
00:44:38,704 --> 00:44:40,726
is from Long Turn.

634
00:44:40,726 --> 00:44:45,771
And we referenced a lot of very similar scenes

635
00:44:45,771 --> 00:44:49,275
from a wide variety of film.

636
00:44:49,655 --> 00:44:53,076
and probably non-film references from,

637
00:44:53,076 --> 00:44:55,937
and it doesn't have to be anything that's from modern days,

638
00:44:55,937 --> 00:44:59,779
everything old, new, from East and West.

639
00:44:59,779 --> 00:45:03,760
But the very first scene that we showed to the team

640
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:04,900
was from that.

641
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:08,302
Yeah, it was really the table scene that made me think of it.

642
00:45:08,302 --> 00:45:10,343
But sorry, the real question I wanted to ask was...

643
00:45:10,343 --> 00:45:10,663
Oh, okay.

644
00:45:10,663 --> 00:45:13,865
Well, I decided not to make that to be such a thing.

645
00:45:13,865 --> 00:45:17,026
But I was just curious, was VR always part of the plan?

646
00:45:17,026 --> 00:45:19,668
And if not, because I know you made a comment about

647
00:45:19,668 --> 00:45:23,329
you just had to keep a schedule and didn't want to ship late.

648
00:45:23,329 --> 00:45:26,311
So I was just wondering if VR was in the plan early,

649
00:45:26,311 --> 00:45:29,352
and if it wasn't, how did you manage to get that in

650
00:45:29,352 --> 00:45:31,033
without the schedule changing?

651
00:45:33,617 --> 00:45:36,058
Yeah, I'm sorry.

652
00:45:36,058 --> 00:45:39,220
This is a question I get asked a lot.

653
00:45:39,220 --> 00:45:41,081
Well, as I explained today,

654
00:45:41,081 --> 00:45:43,082
I heard from Takeuchi first,

655
00:45:43,082 --> 00:45:44,242
and I thought,

656
00:45:44,242 --> 00:45:46,083
VR would be a perfect fit for it.

657
00:45:46,083 --> 00:45:47,384
So I included it in my first GDD.

658
00:45:47,384 --> 00:45:52,487
But I actually started developing it

659
00:45:52,487 --> 00:45:54,888
after the main game

660
00:45:54,888 --> 00:45:55,348
was released,

661
00:45:55,348 --> 00:45:56,108
a little after that.

662
00:45:57,281 --> 00:46:02,883
So yeah, when we got the mandate from Takeuchi,

663
00:46:02,883 --> 00:46:07,045
I thought in an instant, okay, this is meant for VR.

664
00:46:07,045 --> 00:46:09,426
It would be the perfect fit.

665
00:46:09,426 --> 00:46:12,987
But in reality, when we started really working on VR,

666
00:46:12,987 --> 00:46:16,649
it wasn't until a little bit into the development period.

667
00:46:16,649 --> 00:46:17,989
Yeah, in the original design doc,

668
00:46:17,989 --> 00:46:21,811
he had included VR as well, but it wasn't necessary.

669
00:46:21,811 --> 00:46:25,472
We didn't actually start building it out immediately.

670
00:46:26,797 --> 00:46:28,300
Thank you. Thank you. I know.

671
00:46:28,300 --> 00:46:32,311
I do see people lined up on this side too,

672
00:46:32,311 --> 00:46:34,898
so let's take one from that side.

673
00:46:35,099 --> 00:46:38,182
First off, I'd like to say that I really enjoyed this game.

674
00:46:38,182 --> 00:46:42,287
It was really nice to play a Resident Evil game again that really encapsulated the horror

675
00:46:42,287 --> 00:46:46,511
that the genre and game series has been trying to keep alive.

676
00:46:46,511 --> 00:46:53,138
You mentioned how they kind of progress in a sequential order, like 1 through 3 is the

677
00:46:53,138 --> 00:46:57,363
third person, and then 4 through 6 is more action-oriented.

678
00:46:57,623 --> 00:47:01,864
Are you planning on going with that approach with Resident Evil from this point on as well?

679
00:47:01,864 --> 00:47:05,405
Is there going to be 8 and 9 following 7's approach?

680
00:47:05,405 --> 00:47:19,008
Or are you up in the air about that right now?

681
00:47:19,008 --> 00:47:20,028
Good question.

682
00:47:20,028 --> 00:47:23,149
Yes, as I said before we made 7,

683
00:47:23,149 --> 00:47:24,829
but as for Survival Horror,

684
00:47:25,389 --> 00:47:37,799
So, yeah, it was in the slide, and prior to 7, we can sort of group them into threes.

685
00:47:37,799 --> 00:47:47,606
However, with this genre of survival horror, mystery and suspense is key, which means

686
00:47:47,606 --> 00:47:52,550
who knows what's going to happen.

687
00:47:57,003 --> 00:48:03,764
Okay, okay. I have two questions one is for the VR mode. They use a sort of locomotion which is

688
00:48:03,764 --> 00:48:12,706
Continuous locomotion and up to now many games that use this type of locomotion people got sick

689
00:48:12,706 --> 00:48:16,307
So did you try out also other types of locomotion with?

690
00:48:16,307 --> 00:48:23,309
Teleports and so on and when was it that you were safe that this type of locomotion didn't make people sick

691
00:48:35,825 --> 00:48:41,047
Japanese Interpretation

692
00:49:00,723 --> 00:49:02,745
Yes, that's right.

693
00:49:02,745 --> 00:49:11,292
Some of you may know this, but the first VR game to be released in Japan was Train E3.

694
00:49:12,063 --> 00:49:21,005
We were pretty confident, but we got a lot of negative feedback that we were going to become too emotional.

695
00:49:21,005 --> 00:49:23,866
And then, Sony told us that we needed to do more.

696
00:49:23,866 --> 00:49:25,987
So, we tried a lot of things before the release,

697
00:49:25,987 --> 00:49:34,329
and we actually used dozens of staff in the company for the test play.

698
00:49:34,329 --> 00:49:39,451
I'm really sorry to everyone, but there were quite a few people who got drunk because it was a test.

699
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:45,668
We tried a lot of different patterns and were able to control it quite well.

700
00:49:45,668 --> 00:49:49,273
That's how we were able to go with the current specifications.

701
00:49:49,616 --> 00:49:57,164
So the very first time we showed off VR mode in semi-public trade was last year's E3.

702
00:49:57,164 --> 00:50:07,394
We came in with a good amount of confidence to E3, but the result was that we did hear

703
00:50:07,394 --> 00:50:10,097
a lot of people who said that they got sick.

704
00:50:12,138 --> 00:50:13,839
we did have some negative feedback.

705
00:50:13,839 --> 00:50:16,520
And so really, it was only after post E3

706
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:19,681
that we really, really started looking into

707
00:50:19,681 --> 00:50:22,142
how we can improve and make it better.

708
00:50:22,142 --> 00:50:26,703
We also got advice, very important and valuable advice

709
00:50:26,703 --> 00:50:27,803
from the Sony team.

710
00:50:28,244 --> 00:50:29,745
and worked very hard.

711
00:50:29,745 --> 00:50:32,488
They encouraged us to do better,

712
00:50:32,488 --> 00:50:33,969
and that we can do better.

713
00:50:33,969 --> 00:50:38,714
So, and then prior to sort of mastering up or pre-release,

714
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:42,578
we did a lot of user testing within the company.

715
00:50:42,578 --> 00:50:43,879
Several of our staff.

716
00:50:44,259 --> 00:50:46,800
and personnel had tested the game too.

717
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,902
And I feel bad because I know that some people really got sick.

718
00:50:50,902 --> 00:50:56,084
It is a test, so a lot of people probably were in for a little bit of a surprise.

719
00:50:56,084 --> 00:51:00,366
But that's when we started tweaking and fine-tuning and a lot of trial and error

720
00:51:00,366 --> 00:51:05,108
and really got to find the right kind of zone where we landed.

721
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:13,843
And second question is, you said part 7 would be more suspenseful and scary, and the first half of the game really is,

722
00:51:13,843 --> 00:51:20,047
but the second half is more action-oriented, the final is very much gunfights and so on.

723
00:51:20,047 --> 00:51:28,331
Was that a compromise to don't set off the fans so much, or was it planned, and would you do it otherwise,

724
00:51:28,331 --> 00:51:32,974
taking it the scary way and the slow way all the way to the end the next time?

725
00:51:33,314 --> 00:51:35,656
take had heard of this and what it wants.

726
00:51:35,656 --> 00:51:38,117
So he thinks, there's still a mean arrangement,

727
00:51:38,117 --> 00:51:40,318
and it'd be best if he raised all of that,

728
00:51:40,318 --> 00:51:42,840
or is it something that our guys that want it

729
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:45,061
are at the outside trying to do forward?

730
00:51:45,061 --> 00:51:47,003
Is that what you set in your mind,

731
00:51:47,003 --> 00:51:48,844
or would you like to go transition

732
00:51:48,844 --> 00:51:50,785
with a conclusion that's consistent

733
00:51:50,785 --> 00:51:52,566
with your discussions previously?

734
00:51:52,566 --> 00:51:53,107
So as a result,

735
00:51:53,107 --> 00:51:56,209
as we now go back to the discussion

736
00:51:56,209 --> 00:52:00,551
we think that there is motion

737
00:52:02,862 --> 00:52:10,085
I wanted to make the level design so that players can understand the mystery of the game in the latter half of the game,

738
00:52:10,085 --> 00:52:16,307
and when they have a hard time, they can beat the enemies and go to the goal.

739
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:21,468
I wanted to make an escalation like that, so I made it into the current level design.

740
00:52:22,327 --> 00:52:27,013
So it's fair to say that even ourselves now post-release,

741
00:52:27,013 --> 00:52:31,159
we can perhaps view it in that manner too.

742
00:52:31,159 --> 00:52:32,861
So I don't disagree with that.

743
00:52:32,861 --> 00:52:36,105
However, from a level design perspective,

744
00:52:36,105 --> 00:52:39,309
the aim that we had there was that in the first half

745
00:52:39,309 --> 00:52:40,851
of the game, you're now.

746
00:52:43,153 --> 00:52:46,414
solving mysteries, you're finding out more, right?

747
00:52:46,414 --> 00:52:49,676
And so towards the end of, or the latter half,

748
00:52:49,676 --> 00:52:51,097
is that now that you're stronger

749
00:52:51,097 --> 00:52:53,478
and you have a lot more of these mysteries solved

750
00:52:53,478 --> 00:52:55,239
and you've uncovered all this,

751
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,981
that you can take an approach of maybe, you know,

752
00:52:57,981 --> 00:53:01,022
trying to be in a position where you can go out

753
00:53:01,022 --> 00:53:04,484
and really defeat the characters, defeat the enemies.

754
00:53:04,484 --> 00:53:06,265
So that was really more the intent.

755
00:53:06,785 --> 00:53:12,648
that you uncover, but then as you're progressing the game,

756
00:53:12,648 --> 00:53:14,690
that you would use that to your strength.

757
00:53:14,690 --> 00:53:14,970
Thank you.

758
00:53:14,970 --> 00:53:15,030
Hi.

759
00:53:15,030 --> 00:53:16,190
Actually, that was sort of my question,

760
00:53:16,190 --> 00:53:21,573
but now I made something up on the spot here.

761
00:53:21,573 --> 00:53:27,376
On one of the slides, you had some influences

762
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:30,378
of what horror could be, like you showed amnesia

763
00:53:30,378 --> 00:53:31,478
and Outlast.

764
00:53:32,639 --> 00:53:39,921
So that kind of progression of horror games turned into a lot of more indie developers.

765
00:53:39,921 --> 00:53:42,342
I feel like there was a lot of influence from them.

766
00:53:42,342 --> 00:53:48,685
Was there any kind of reaching out or kind of just sharing or collaborating of ideas with those indie developers?

767
00:53:50,416 --> 00:53:57,938
Also, I know you have the exclusive right to decide what you're going to use and how you're going to show the film

768
00:53:57,938 --> 00:54:04,960
but mainly the players have the freedom to decide what they're going to use for the movie

769
00:54:04,960 --> 00:54:07,800
There's also the circle of gods

770
00:54:07,800 --> 00:54:14,022
So, you have this exclusive right that allows you to have conversation with your co-workers

771
00:54:14,022 --> 00:54:19,143
I wonder if you have ever experienced those kinds of ideas that came out around you?

772
00:54:21,320 --> 00:54:29,905
Well, we do play a lot of indie titles, but we don't have that many in Japan.

773
00:54:29,905 --> 00:54:38,690
So we haven't had that much experience.

774
00:54:50,857 --> 00:54:53,099
a lot of the developers that make these games,

775
00:54:53,099 --> 00:54:55,923
they're not really physically located in Japan.

776
00:54:55,923 --> 00:55:00,688
So it's not as easy for us to have maybe some communication

777
00:55:00,688 --> 00:55:01,549
or meeting up with them

778
00:55:01,549 --> 00:55:02,890
and just having casual conversations.

779
00:55:02,890 --> 00:55:05,473
So we haven't had the opportunity to really do that.

780
00:55:05,473 --> 00:55:05,714
Thank you.

781
00:55:09,803 --> 00:55:13,725
Thank you so much for your wonderful presentation.

782
00:55:13,725 --> 00:55:18,147
I've been a big Resident Evil fan for a long time, so...

783
00:55:18,147 --> 00:55:24,010
And I've been very receptive to the different directions that the series has gone in over the last 20 years.

784
00:55:24,010 --> 00:55:28,653
However, a lot of people who I respect would say things like...

785
00:55:29,362 --> 00:55:34,027
you know, they really miss the action elements of Resident Evil 4 through 6,

786
00:55:34,027 --> 00:55:36,410
and I even had one person say that

787
00:55:36,410 --> 00:55:40,275
he'd rather RE7 didn't do so well, so you guys could go back to

788
00:55:40,275 --> 00:55:42,618
that more action-oriented direction, and...

789
00:55:42,618 --> 00:55:43,439
Thank you.

790
00:55:44,052 --> 00:55:55,799
Takahashi-san, I want to know, what would you say to a person with that kind of mindset?

791
00:55:55,799 --> 00:56:09,366
And how do you get them to like the direction you took the game in?

792
00:56:12,428 --> 00:56:16,531
I think it's okay to fail.

793
00:56:16,531 --> 00:56:21,734
I think I explained it in today's presentation,

794
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:28,579
but I think it's difficult to make all the fans satisfied.

795
00:56:28,579 --> 00:56:32,242
If you've played a lot, you'll know,

796
00:56:32,242 --> 00:56:38,567
but the Baradar series has made a lot of spin-offs.

797
00:56:39,307 --> 00:56:45,209
So, Capcom doesn't want to make action-oriented games at all,

798
00:56:45,209 --> 00:56:52,391
but we want to focus on the concept of the project and make choices and focus on it.

799
00:56:52,391 --> 00:56:59,293
So, simply put, please look forward to the future development.

800
00:57:00,693 --> 00:57:07,221
Yeah, so there was one slide that we or Pete had shown. It says we can't fit this all in one package.

801
00:57:07,221 --> 00:57:15,251
And so the meaning behind that obviously is that, you know, not all RE games are going to be 100% enjoyed by all RE fans at any time.

802
00:57:18,054 --> 00:57:26,759
And as you know if you've been following the series there's also, besides the numerical REs, we've had some spin-offs.

803
00:57:26,759 --> 00:57:35,925
And so we're not saying that Capcom or our RE team is not going back ever to action-oriented RE games.

804
00:57:35,925 --> 00:57:39,186
I think that the simple sort of...

805
00:57:39,547 --> 00:57:46,979
vision and owning up and committing to that and keeping focus keeping true to that is what we are trying to say here today for

806
00:57:46,979 --> 00:57:54,190
RE7 and I think you guys you know can look forward to what we may come up with in the future

807
00:57:54,853 --> 00:57:55,934
Thank you.

808
00:57:55,934 --> 00:57:59,677
Okay, a little bit more.

809
00:57:59,677 --> 00:58:09,044
And this is, sorry, we're out of time, so this is going to be lost.

810
00:58:21,587 --> 00:58:25,410
So I actually, I also worked on Revelations.

811
00:58:25,410 --> 00:58:27,072
So just to give you an example, you know,

812
00:58:27,072 --> 00:58:29,314
it's not just the numerical titles that I worked on.

813
00:58:29,314 --> 00:58:33,358
So I enjoyed, you know, basically kind of controlling

814
00:58:33,358 --> 00:58:36,281
and giving life to Chris and Jill for that.

815
00:58:36,281 --> 00:58:38,783
But in this, like, let's say if we had Leon

816
00:58:38,783 --> 00:58:41,506
and then like he opens up the pot and like,

817
00:58:41,506 --> 00:58:43,367
oh, there's cockroaches, like that's not something that.

818
00:58:43,868 --> 00:58:47,229
I don't know if you guys would enjoy that as much.

819
00:58:47,229 --> 00:58:50,850
So, you know, there's a certain focus that we just stick to.

820
00:58:50,850 --> 00:58:53,871
And that just happens to be what we did for RE7.

821
00:58:53,871 --> 00:58:55,952
Can I ask one last question really quickly?

822
00:58:55,952 --> 00:58:56,252
Okay.

823
00:58:56,252 --> 00:59:00,674
I love the game and I really liked your art director's idea

824
00:59:00,674 --> 00:59:04,435
that you could get sliced in two and then have to crawl to the safe room.

825
00:59:04,435 --> 00:59:08,657
Was there anything else that you rejected because it was too disgusting?

826
00:59:09,988 --> 00:59:27,966
I know that you have a lot of ideas, but do you have any other ideas that you want to share?

827
00:59:27,966 --> 00:59:32,250
I do, but I might use them next time.

828
00:59:32,250 --> 00:59:33,932
I'm sorry, I can't say.
