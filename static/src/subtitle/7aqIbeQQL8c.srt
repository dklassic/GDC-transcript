00:00:06,726 --> 00:00:18,729
Welcome to the Rick and Morty virtual reality VR lessons learned with Alchemy Labs. Don't

2
00:00:18,749 --> 00:00:23,491
applaud yet. It's just downhill from there. My name is Alex Schwartz and I'm the CEO of

3
00:00:23,591 --> 00:00:29,232
Alchemy Labs. I'm Devin Reimer. I'm the chief technology owl at Alchemy Labs.

4
00:00:31,334 --> 00:00:36,821
So we are makers of Job Simulator. It came out on the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch and PlayStation

5
00:00:36,841 --> 00:00:42,869
VR. Most recently we launched Rick and Morty virtual reality which we'll be talking about

6
00:00:42,909 --> 00:00:43,069
today.

7
00:00:45,718 --> 00:00:50,762
So I want to talk about the origin story of how this project came to be, how we ended up

8
00:00:50,802 --> 00:00:54,804
kind of working on this IP. And first as a disclaimer, there's going to be a lot of

9
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:58,126
swearing. There's going to be spoilers for the game because we're going to talk all the way

10
00:00:58,166 --> 00:01:03,510
through development from beginning to end. And the show itself, you know, has a mature

11
00:01:03,550 --> 00:01:07,492
rating and therefore the game has a mature rating. Therefore the talk has a mature rating.

12
00:01:07,552 --> 00:01:09,674
So this should be fairly straightforward.

13
00:01:10,554 --> 00:01:16,699
So we were mid‑development on Job Simulator when we noticed that the co‑creator of Rick

14
00:01:16,719 --> 00:01:21,363
and Morty, Justin Roiland, was tweeting madly about how much he loved Job Simulator and

15
00:01:21,383 --> 00:01:26,908
was freaking out. So as huge fans of the show, we clearly had to contact him and say, hey,

16
00:01:26,928 --> 00:01:30,731
we should get together and show you what we're working on with the new levels. We ended up

17
00:01:31,171 --> 00:01:34,654
kind of DMing back and forth and figuring out a time to meet up in person.

18
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:42,636
Now, we had this plan to pitch Justin on the concept that what if the interaction methods

19
00:01:42,957 --> 00:01:46,977
and the game itself of Job Simulator were existing in a totally different world in Rick's

20
00:01:47,037 --> 00:01:48,658
garage in Rick and Morty.

21
00:01:49,378 --> 00:01:52,279
And our plan was to go there and kind of lightly pitch it.

22
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,220
And it turned out when we got there, he also had a similar idea.

23
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,561
And so we were showing him some of the Job Simulator levels and here was 10, 15 seconds

24
00:02:01,621 --> 00:02:04,342
of him reacting to seeing new Job Simulator content.

25
00:02:10,059 --> 00:02:18,522
you guys shut up oh it's like fucking flappy bird like the same kind of shit in rick's garage

26
00:02:18,542 --> 00:02:25,264
just like you guys said are you fucking kidding me so clearly he enjoyed it

27
00:02:27,224 --> 00:02:32,245
and in a short amount of time we were actually headed down to William Street to go pitch the

28
00:02:32,305 --> 00:02:38,487
heads of adult swim on the concept that we had talked about and after that pitch it was a big

29
00:02:38,507 --> 00:02:44,648
thumbs up, game on, let's make this thing. So let's fast forward to the end of the project.

30
00:02:44,668 --> 00:02:49,670
This is the 30 second TV trailer that we made to kind of show you kind of what the end up game

31
00:02:49,690 --> 00:02:50,090
looked like.

32
00:02:50,789 --> 00:02:55,433
What is this, Rick? It looks like some sort of crazy video game about us or something.

33
00:02:55,453 --> 00:02:58,815
It's not just a video game, Morty. It's a virtual reality game.

34
00:02:59,316 --> 00:03:02,398
I sold our likenesses to some video game publisher for a lot of money, Morty.

35
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:04,540
I mean, who's gonna play this?

36
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,383
You're gonna play this, Morty.

37
00:03:08,524 --> 00:03:08,684
What?

38
00:03:09,601 --> 00:03:11,906
Oh my god! Y-y-you killed it! I mean me!

39
00:03:12,306 --> 00:03:12,627
I mean-

40
00:03:12,647 --> 00:03:13,288
VR for everyone!

41
00:03:13,649 --> 00:03:15,172
Everyone with a box on their face, Morty!

42
00:03:15,272 --> 00:03:17,196
It's raining money here in VR land!

43
00:03:17,517 --> 00:03:18,278
It's raining money!

44
00:03:18,298 --> 00:03:20,021
Ha ha! Wubba lubba dub dub!

45
00:03:23,793 --> 00:03:27,756
So in working on Job Simulator, we ended up building this underlying tech that we called

46
00:03:27,896 --> 00:03:32,599
Alchemy VR. This governed all of our interaction systems with the world itself. So we ended

47
00:03:32,639 --> 00:03:36,342
up having this baseline to start work on top of, which was great. But we knew we needed

48
00:03:36,382 --> 00:03:41,206
a ton of new features and needed to do some serious refractors to completely separate

49
00:03:41,246 --> 00:03:43,068
Job Simulator from the underlying tech.

50
00:03:45,137 --> 00:03:50,042
We knew, as Alex mentioned, that Rick's Garage was kind of the key tenant to this. In Job Simulator,

51
00:03:50,062 --> 00:03:53,666
we ended up building these environments so that they were built around the gameplay

52
00:03:53,706 --> 00:03:57,690
themselves. So if you play Job Simulator, you know that in the convenience store, the convenience

53
00:03:57,710 --> 00:04:00,012
store area is built around that one play space.

54
00:04:00,913 --> 00:04:04,694
We knew in Rick's garage that it was bigger and there was no way for us to scale the

55
00:04:04,734 --> 00:04:08,375
entire garage down to the size of your own room in your house because otherwise it would

56
00:04:08,415 --> 00:04:13,517
be Rick's garage would end up being a phone booth. So we knew we needed some method of

57
00:04:13,577 --> 00:04:18,019
locomotion because we couldn't change the garage so much because essentially it was very

58
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:18,879
iconic to the IP.

59
00:04:21,327 --> 00:04:25,133
People that have watched our talks before know that we are not fans of artificial

60
00:04:25,153 --> 00:04:29,340
locomotion. It is very important to us to not make people sick. We want to make people

61
00:04:29,380 --> 00:04:33,567
feel comfortable and we want people to come into the content knowing that it's going to

62
00:04:33,627 --> 00:04:34,128
work for them.

63
00:04:36,889 --> 00:04:40,152
There is many different methods of solving the problem,

64
00:04:40,272 --> 00:04:42,533
getting from one location to another in VR.

65
00:04:44,055 --> 00:04:46,276
In our opinion, some existing teleportation methods

66
00:04:46,436 --> 00:04:48,118
aren't that great, at least for the content

67
00:04:48,138 --> 00:04:48,818
that we're building.

68
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,820
The method of pointing at a specific location

69
00:04:52,041 --> 00:04:55,203
and going to that spot is something that we refer to

70
00:04:55,383 --> 00:04:56,784
as granular teleportation.

71
00:04:56,824 --> 00:04:59,686
You pick an exact spot and then you end up going there.

72
00:05:00,567 --> 00:05:01,868
This can lead to many issues.

73
00:05:02,649 --> 00:05:06,471
One thing that we've noticed is that people stop physically moving around in their own

74
00:05:06,591 --> 00:05:10,253
play space. They end up standing in the middle of the room, their feet planted and just pop

75
00:05:10,293 --> 00:05:15,596
around. This ends up having some huge issues because we've discovered that this ends up

76
00:05:15,636 --> 00:05:20,199
leading to more fatigue. People that actually move around a little bit in their space end

77
00:05:20,279 --> 00:05:24,402
up playing much longer because your legs just aren't designed to be locked in one position

78
00:05:24,442 --> 00:05:25,702
for a long period of time.

79
00:05:26,783 --> 00:05:30,905
also it ends up sometimes causing the problem where you have an item that you can see but you

80
00:05:30,945 --> 00:05:35,267
might not be able to get to it because you're real world physical bounds. This causes this

81
00:05:35,527 --> 00:05:40,329
process to have to run in the back of your mind all the time of, oh, am I going to run into

82
00:05:40,389 --> 00:05:43,911
trouble with my real world space? And this is something that we don't like. We want people to

83
00:05:43,951 --> 00:05:47,312
get into VR and kind of forget about the world around them outside of VR.

84
00:05:49,519 --> 00:05:52,481
So the method that we came up with for Rick and Morty was

85
00:05:52,501 --> 00:05:54,382
something we called zone-based teleportation.

86
00:05:54,762 --> 00:05:57,323
So we ended up dividing the garage into these multiple

87
00:05:57,383 --> 00:05:59,504
zones that end up fitting your play space.

88
00:06:00,325 --> 00:06:02,306
So what you end up doing is you look in the direction that

89
00:06:02,326 --> 00:06:04,367
you want to go, and you hit the button to teleport, and

90
00:06:04,387 --> 00:06:05,607
then you go to that space.

91
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:09,269
That's as simple as it is, but it's not that simple to end up

92
00:06:09,329 --> 00:06:09,830
implementing.

93
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:16,572
Yeah, so when it came to with Job Simulator, we really wanted to make sure that our content

94
00:06:16,612 --> 00:06:21,755
worked on every platform and every room size that you could possibly have. So a really big

95
00:06:21,815 --> 00:06:25,377
living room, a really small room. And so we ended up building this method to build

96
00:06:26,357 --> 00:06:29,299
customize handmade different versions of the layouts

97
00:06:29,939 --> 00:06:30,960
of each of the rooms.

98
00:06:31,060 --> 00:06:33,801
And now with this new zone-based teleportation system,

99
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:37,323
you end up having to redesign each teleportation zone

100
00:06:37,443 --> 00:06:41,466
to be fitting within your own customized room scale size.

101
00:06:41,846 --> 00:06:42,947
And so we ended up building,

102
00:06:43,087 --> 00:06:46,288
hand building three custom 360 degree track sizes,

103
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:48,169
and then two custom 180 degree track sizes.

104
00:06:50,291 --> 00:06:52,572
which you can see here in our editor we're flipping through

105
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:56,014
and it's not just changes to positions of items or scales

106
00:06:56,574 --> 00:06:57,395
because you can't really get away

107
00:06:57,435 --> 00:06:58,496
with scaling things down like that.

108
00:06:58,976 --> 00:07:01,818
It's hand-authored new desks and new replacements

109
00:07:01,858 --> 00:07:04,039
for washers and all these different kinds of swap-outs

110
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:05,060
to make it really feel right.

111
00:07:06,959 --> 00:07:11,640
And so when you take a top down view of the room, it's really important to note, so anyone

112
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:15,942
who's really, really hardcore about the show, when they look at this, they might notice

113
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:22,004
something slightly off, which is that the shelf is actually located down on the bottom

114
00:07:22,084 --> 00:07:27,526
part of the room. And so everything else is essentially the same. But when we

115
00:07:28,146 --> 00:07:30,869
ended up going and looking at the design of the room

116
00:07:31,009 --> 00:07:32,751
and wanted to start to accommodate

117
00:07:33,472 --> 00:07:35,655
180 degree tracking spaces,

118
00:07:35,915 --> 00:07:38,137
we realized that the shelf was the only interaction point

119
00:07:38,177 --> 00:07:39,839
where you had to face completely backward.

120
00:07:40,380 --> 00:07:45,806
So if you take a look at what each zone based location,

121
00:07:46,367 --> 00:07:47,488
if you look at the three arrows,

122
00:07:47,588 --> 00:07:48,269
those are kind of the,

123
00:07:48,769 --> 00:07:50,231
in a 180 degree tracking setup,

124
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:51,632
the way that you can face forward

125
00:07:51,652 --> 00:07:53,134
and still have interaction with your hands

126
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:53,954
without being occluded.

127
00:07:54,295 --> 00:07:56,137
And so moving that single shelf allowed us

128
00:07:56,217 --> 00:07:59,079
to have a space where you can face to your right,

129
00:07:59,139 --> 00:08:00,761
down in the bottom right, to do laundry.

130
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:03,003
And you can face forward and left and right at the desks,

131
00:08:03,404 --> 00:08:05,586
and you never have to do hand-based interactions behind you.

132
00:08:06,898 --> 00:08:12,462
Now, that's actually because of the IP and the way that it's been built, we were able to

133
00:08:12,502 --> 00:08:16,964
take some creative liberties. So we actually put scratches on the ground where the shelf is

134
00:08:17,024 --> 00:08:22,027
located now and where it used to be, kind of like a faded area where it used to exist. I

135
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:25,249
think that's what's great about this IP, it's almost anti‑canon and you can make those

136
00:08:25,289 --> 00:08:28,811
types of jokes. In fact, right when you start the game, most people probably don't notice it,

137
00:08:28,872 --> 00:08:33,074
but Rick delivers a line, he's like, Morty, I rearranged the whole garage to make this

138
00:08:33,094 --> 00:08:36,036
happen. So we just kind of joke our way out of that and move on.

139
00:08:38,171 --> 00:08:42,014
So zone based teleportation, we're a fan because essentially

140
00:08:42,034 --> 00:08:44,395
it takes the mental overload off the player itself.

141
00:08:45,236 --> 00:08:46,837
But from a game design standpoint,

142
00:08:46,937 --> 00:08:48,378
it can become very challenging.

143
00:08:48,938 --> 00:08:50,559
So here is that top down layout.

144
00:08:51,560 --> 00:08:55,083
We have these zones that we don't want people to stand in.

145
00:08:55,463 --> 00:08:57,244
So when you end up teleporting to another zone,

146
00:08:57,304 --> 00:08:59,205
you're at the mercy of the exact location

147
00:08:59,225 --> 00:09:01,207
that you were in your room scale space

148
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:02,548
when you end up doing the teleport.

149
00:09:03,208 --> 00:09:05,470
So on the top left quadrant here, we have the,

150
00:09:07,010 --> 00:09:10,452
the shelving unit which we don't want people to stand within. In the top right quadrant we

151
00:09:10,472 --> 00:09:14,433
have this desk that kind of wraps around you and then on the bottom right we end up having

152
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:19,774
this washer and dryer. So how do we end up handling this? The way that we do this is we take

153
00:09:19,874 --> 00:09:23,495
every zone that you can teleport into from another zone and we do an overlay method.

154
00:09:23,856 --> 00:09:28,018
and so here's the actual overlay of the worst case scenario of zones that we don't want you

155
00:09:28,038 --> 00:09:31,901
to stand within because if you were standing within that zone and you teleported into

156
00:09:31,941 --> 00:09:36,944
another zone you could be inside of another piece of geometry. And so why we have no method

157
00:09:36,984 --> 00:09:40,806
of actually forcing someone to stand in a particular location, from a game design

158
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:45,229
perspective we can go and lay things out in different ways so that people don't generally

159
00:09:45,289 --> 00:09:46,350
stand in those zones.

160
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:48,471
And then the zones that we do take up,

161
00:09:48,511 --> 00:09:50,112
we try to make them as narrow as possible.

162
00:09:50,172 --> 00:09:52,975
So if you are slightly inside of a piece of geometry,

163
00:09:53,255 --> 00:09:55,196
generally what people do is kind of move their head back

164
00:09:55,236 --> 00:09:56,817
a little bit and it won't feel like they're inside

165
00:09:56,838 --> 00:09:57,858
that piece of geometry.

166
00:10:00,403 --> 00:10:03,385
So one huge thing that we clearly had to tackle was the

167
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:04,425
concept of portals.

168
00:10:04,565 --> 00:10:07,867
So in Rick and Morty, in the show, it's an iconic part of

169
00:10:07,947 --> 00:10:09,949
the entire IP.

170
00:10:10,469 --> 00:10:12,991
So it would be so awesome to be able to step through a

171
00:10:13,071 --> 00:10:14,672
portal in VR.

172
00:10:15,372 --> 00:10:18,334
And so it also enabled us to have some way to get out of

173
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:20,155
the garage as the base area.

174
00:10:20,655 --> 00:10:23,277
But all the technical and design challenges that were

175
00:10:23,337 --> 00:10:26,539
presented, I want to talk through how we approach those.

176
00:10:27,139 --> 00:10:33,321
So first we actually got this massive IP Bible from the Adult Swim team that said all the

177
00:10:33,361 --> 00:10:40,322
rules of how portals work and they said, okay, a portal can only be shot on a flat surface and

178
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:45,483
when you emerge from the portal, you can have it kind of appear in open space. But when it

179
00:10:45,503 --> 00:10:49,464
gets shot first, where you go in has to be against a hard surface and flat. So the

180
00:10:49,504 --> 00:10:55,346
challenge is how do we even get a flat, large surface inside of your play space on demand? You

181
00:10:55,386 --> 00:10:56,826
would think, okay, use a wall, but.

182
00:10:57,646 --> 00:11:01,247
the walls are by definition going to be at the edge of your play space. So imagine jumping

183
00:11:01,267 --> 00:11:07,528
through a portal and jumping directly into a wall. So what we ended up doing is this video

184
00:11:07,688 --> 00:11:13,730
ends up showing it in the best way possible, is that clone Morty right here is going to walk

185
00:11:13,890 --> 00:11:19,051
through this portal from the garage and notice that the area that he is in is taking up about

186
00:11:19,651 --> 00:11:21,591
66 percent or two-thirds of the available space.

187
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:27,453
Once he goes through the portal into the bathroom, he's in that one‑third left and so has

188
00:11:27,493 --> 00:11:31,655
enough space to get in without hitting a wall. And then when the portal actually goes down

189
00:11:31,735 --> 00:11:36,256
into the ground and comes up in a new position so that you could then turn around and go

190
00:11:36,276 --> 00:11:40,277
back through. So it avoids all these issues like, number one, if you go through a portal

191
00:11:40,297 --> 00:11:44,379
and then move back a millimeter, you might accidentally re‑portal backward. So this

192
00:11:44,419 --> 00:11:48,360
helps solve that because you closed the portal behind you. The second is a little magical

193
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,881
little thing here. I don't know if my mouse will show on the screen. It does.

194
00:11:52,002 --> 00:11:57,167
there's a lever that you pull to open the portal wall. And that's very specifically placed

195
00:11:57,247 --> 00:12:01,771
because you have to grab that portal, sorry, that handle and that means that you're

196
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:05,654
standing in exactly that spot at the time that you do it. Thus ensuring that you're in the

197
00:12:05,674 --> 00:12:09,618
right spot so that when the portal comes up you have enough room to go into it because you

198
00:12:09,638 --> 00:12:14,142
wouldn't want to teleport over and then be behind the portal wall or something crazy.

199
00:12:17,172 --> 00:12:20,493
So now that we've figured out kind of from a game play standpoint how this is all going to

200
00:12:20,533 --> 00:12:24,234
work, the next challenge was how to do this visually. So one of the first things we ended

201
00:12:24,274 --> 00:12:28,455
up doing was starting working with render textures to try to figure out how to render a

202
00:12:28,716 --> 00:12:33,017
portal out correctly. In VR this is really challenging because essentially you can get

203
00:12:33,057 --> 00:12:37,018
really close to things and in the case of a portal you're actually walking through it. And

204
00:12:37,058 --> 00:12:41,320
we don't want any popping, we want essentially a seamless transition. The problem with

205
00:12:41,380 --> 00:12:44,361
using things like render textures is that you're set to a certain resolution.

206
00:12:44,661 --> 00:12:48,001
So as you get closer to the quality goes down, so we needed to come up with a different method.

207
00:12:49,666 --> 00:12:55,490
Our end result was a very complicated system that is unable to describe in slides alone.

208
00:12:56,030 --> 00:13:00,173
But essentially we ended up using a method of multiple cameras and depth masks to

209
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:05,157
essentially layer the world. So we ended up doing things like stepping through the remote

210
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:10,080
world sky box and the remote world then your local sky box, then your local world and then

211
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:14,763
have to do a ton of other things like handling items that you've grabbed that are close to

212
00:13:14,803 --> 00:13:18,406
the portal and making sure that they're rendering at the highest quality in the exact correct

213
00:13:18,466 --> 00:13:18,866
position.

214
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:34,226
So as I mentioned, being in VR makes portals extra challenging. Because essentially

215
00:13:34,346 --> 00:13:38,108
unlike traditional portal games where you can just walk through the portal and that's the

216
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:42,250
interaction mechanism, you can actually reach out and grab things through a portal and pull

217
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:43,411
them back into your world.

218
00:13:44,332 --> 00:13:49,058
This ends up leading to a lot of really, really challenging things because essentially the

219
00:13:49,198 --> 00:13:53,604
garage in this example in the space are located in two physical different spaces within

220
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:57,609
unity. So how do you end up handling the fact that your hand goes through a portal that is in

221
00:13:57,710 --> 00:14:00,373
different part of the world grabbing and interacting with an item?

222
00:14:01,114 --> 00:14:04,954
This was a ton of work but the end result ended up being that we ended up having to

223
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:11,396
essentially bring objects between both worlds and then essentially get the physics force to

224
00:14:11,456 --> 00:14:15,697
apply correctly when you toss across. So here, for example, you go and throw something from a

225
00:14:15,717 --> 00:14:20,878
zero gravity world into a world with gravity and having it drop correctly. The end result was

226
00:14:20,898 --> 00:14:24,539
really awesome and we see this all the time. People play like open a portal to the bathroom

227
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:27,460
and they won't even step all the way into the bathroom. They'll just reach through the

228
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:30,640
portal in the bathroom, grab something off the sink, and then continue on playing.

229
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:37,886
Now that we ended up having this all working, the next thing was perf. Perf in VR is really

230
00:14:37,947 --> 00:14:43,391
hard to begin with and now what we've ended up doing is doubling our renders. So this ended

231
00:14:43,471 --> 00:14:48,175
up being a very time consuming thing to resolve. So we ended up having to do a whole bunch of

232
00:14:48,255 --> 00:14:52,059
magic tricks here. So essentially when you end up standing in front of the portal,

233
00:14:52,948 --> 00:14:56,689
and you start looking through it, we do things like caching local shadows, turning off

234
00:14:56,729 --> 00:15:00,670
certain light sources in your local space when we know that the portal is taking up a

235
00:15:00,710 --> 00:15:04,511
certain amount of your field of view. So as you can see here, as you turn towards the

236
00:15:04,531 --> 00:15:08,192
portal, the portal is generally the very iconic spinning thing and as you turn towards it,

237
00:15:08,812 --> 00:15:13,473
the world fades in. So this has two fundamental reasons why we do that. The first one is if

238
00:15:13,513 --> 00:15:17,394
you're walking through a surface that's completely opaque, that feels really bad. If you

239
00:15:17,414 --> 00:15:20,435
can actually see where you're going, that helps with that. But also from a rendering

240
00:15:20,475 --> 00:15:20,895
standpoint.

241
00:15:21,155 --> 00:15:24,316
By us turning those on and off, when we turn one off we can turn some other things off

242
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:27,557
in the other world and vice versa because we know it's taking up your field of view.

243
00:15:28,698 --> 00:15:33,219
Another challenge from a VR specific thing was that now that you end up stepping through

244
00:15:33,259 --> 00:15:37,680
portals to go to all these fantastic places, there's no loading area, there's no fade to

245
00:15:37,740 --> 00:15:40,061
black that now we can kind of mask some of this loading.

246
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:43,722
And so we started doing a whole bunch of looking into how to handle this.

247
00:15:44,702 --> 00:15:48,884
In the end we determined that asynchronous loading was just not reliable enough to keep

248
00:15:48,964 --> 00:15:53,386
frame rate at a particular quality bar. So we ended up doing was actually loading the

249
00:15:53,446 --> 00:15:58,349
entire game when you end up starting it. This was a huge challenge to keep performance of

250
00:15:58,409 --> 00:16:02,491
the loads in a good spot. But the end result was that you end up as soon as you load the

251
00:16:02,531 --> 00:16:05,112
game you can just play the whole game with never stopping.

252
00:16:08,238 --> 00:16:13,239
Then it comes to mirrors. So because we're gluttons for punishment, there was a mirror that

253
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:19,280
we really wanted in the bathroom because looking at yourself is really, really cool in VR. But

254
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:22,501
now we have a situation where you have a portal in the bathroom and a mirror. So you have

255
00:16:22,521 --> 00:16:27,142
the portal doing the double rendering plus you have a mirror doing a render of that world. We

256
00:16:27,162 --> 00:16:32,223
spent a lot of time with this and a lot of creative placement and tech. What we end up doing

257
00:16:32,283 --> 00:16:33,583
is as you end up looking ‑‑

258
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:38,025
between the worlds and twisting your head from the portal towards the mirror, the mirror will

259
00:16:38,045 --> 00:16:43,787
start showing and as you twist your head towards the mirror to the portal, the portal shows. I

260
00:16:43,887 --> 00:16:47,448
ended up putting a whole bunch of tech to make sure that everything lines up but I'm pretty

261
00:16:47,488 --> 00:16:50,309
confident that most people who played the game didn't even realize that was actually what was

262
00:16:50,329 --> 00:16:50,810
taking place.

263
00:16:53,233 --> 00:16:56,055
So a couple game design challenges to talk through.

264
00:16:56,235 --> 00:16:59,657
One is the concept, the touchy concept of having the player

265
00:16:59,697 --> 00:17:00,558
die in VR.

266
00:17:00,838 --> 00:17:04,480
And so death in a VR game is a little strange.

267
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:08,402
So the thing is we wanted to have this happen as part of the

268
00:17:08,523 --> 00:17:08,983
mechanic.

269
00:17:09,883 --> 00:17:12,325
The player could die at any point in the game, but they

270
00:17:12,345 --> 00:17:16,267
could also be in any physical position or location at the

271
00:17:16,307 --> 00:17:17,068
point of death.

272
00:17:17,128 --> 00:17:19,490
And so when they go, it's like a teleport, essentially.

273
00:17:19,890 --> 00:17:21,331
How do we deal with all of that?

274
00:17:21,371 --> 00:17:22,171
And we also don't want to.

275
00:17:22,852 --> 00:17:28,116
have anything feel punishing for the player. In fact, it's very comic violence ways that the

276
00:17:28,156 --> 00:17:32,979
person can, the player can die. We also don't want to take away control from the player. A

277
00:17:33,119 --> 00:17:37,463
lot of games we've seen, they try to do something where I'm no longer in control of my own

278
00:17:37,523 --> 00:17:42,607
body or I'm disassociated in some way. We didn't like the feeling of being disassociated.

279
00:17:42,687 --> 00:17:48,051
So I'm going to give you a quick example here. This is just someone innocently throwing a

280
00:17:48,131 --> 00:17:49,912
glass bottle into this death pit.

281
00:17:54,675 --> 00:17:57,557
and then a piece of broken glass just went and hit them in the face and killed them.

282
00:17:58,037 --> 00:18:01,880
And so notice that they got brought into this new world, Purgatory.

283
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,884
So what happened here from the design standpoint is we did an instant cut to a

284
00:18:06,924 --> 00:18:11,647
completely different visual location. So it's dark, it's a different color from

285
00:18:11,747 --> 00:18:15,890
every part of the game. And so being in a completely different and empty world

286
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,632
makes it a little less jarring than having to figure out what just happened.

287
00:18:20,554 --> 00:18:23,595
what just happened. And we actually teach it in the very first few minutes of the game

288
00:18:23,655 --> 00:18:28,859
that the player gets shot by Rick, spoilers, and then you have to go back to that death

289
00:18:28,899 --> 00:18:33,882
world and you learn that you understand it. So, but in that world we wanted to have some

290
00:18:33,902 --> 00:18:35,143
interaction and some way to get back.

291
00:18:35,563 --> 00:18:37,663
and we're thinking, okay, if we put like a desk here,

292
00:18:37,723 --> 00:18:39,123
then you might be standing inside of it.

293
00:18:39,164 --> 00:18:39,784
It's very strange.

294
00:18:40,144 --> 00:18:43,244
So we ended up with this design of a very small death phone

295
00:18:43,364 --> 00:18:44,304
on a small pedestal.

296
00:18:44,765 --> 00:18:47,225
And so it's small enough that even if you kind of

297
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,645
are standing right on it, you look down

298
00:18:48,705 --> 00:18:49,966
and you feel like you're standing in front of it

299
00:18:50,726 --> 00:18:51,766
and you're able to pick up the phone.

300
00:18:51,786 --> 00:18:53,486
You get the devil's secretary who tells you

301
00:18:53,506 --> 00:18:54,246
that you shouldn't be here

302
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,327
and you need to come back to life.

303
00:18:55,687 --> 00:18:58,707
And you have the ability to have your own agency

304
00:18:58,767 --> 00:18:59,887
as to when you want to come back

305
00:19:00,527 --> 00:19:02,188
rather than be on a scripted timer.

306
00:19:05,345 --> 00:19:08,608
So the next decision we had to make was who you were from a player standpoint.

307
00:19:08,688 --> 00:19:11,870
In Job Simulator, you're a human, so essentially you end up playing yourself.

308
00:19:12,511 --> 00:19:15,293
In Rick and Morty, we got thinking about, are you Rick, are you Morty?

309
00:19:15,333 --> 00:19:18,376
We really wanted Rick and Morty to interact with one another, so

310
00:19:18,416 --> 00:19:20,918
we needed to determine who you were as a character.

311
00:19:22,207 --> 00:19:27,268
Well we ended up settling on was this concept of a clone Morty. So Morty's very iconic so we're

312
00:19:27,288 --> 00:19:31,689
kind of just like leaning on that. But it ended up fixing some problems and some challenges

313
00:19:31,769 --> 00:19:37,591
in VR. So first off you're a silent protagonist. So this worked with that. The limitations of

314
00:19:37,631 --> 00:19:40,992
VR ended up turning into some of the jokes. So we ended up making a lot of comments about you

315
00:19:41,032 --> 00:19:43,513
just being a clone Morty that's just a floating head and hands.

316
00:19:44,334 --> 00:19:45,635
That ends up feeling really good.

317
00:19:46,076 --> 00:19:48,159
And then on top of that, because you're a clone Morty,

318
00:19:48,539 --> 00:19:50,963
you being dumber than Morty is totally cool,

319
00:19:51,083 --> 00:19:52,685
and now Morty can kind of make fun of you.

320
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,989
So kind of that teaming up against you thing

321
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,792
ended up working really well from a narrative standpoint.

322
00:19:59,853 --> 00:20:02,514
So we have our player who is a clone Morty

323
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:04,635
and now we've decided, okay, you need Rick

324
00:20:04,755 --> 00:20:06,895
and you need Morty to exist in physical space,

325
00:20:07,255 --> 00:20:09,556
fully rigged and animated at full size

326
00:20:09,616 --> 00:20:10,796
right in front of you in VR.

327
00:20:11,196 --> 00:20:12,997
And so this was a pretty big challenge,

328
00:20:13,037 --> 00:20:14,277
in fact, one of the biggest challenges

329
00:20:14,317 --> 00:20:15,917
of trying to do the development of this game.

330
00:20:17,058 --> 00:20:19,158
So first off, there was no 3D reference

331
00:20:19,258 --> 00:20:21,619
for these characters because it's a 2D cartoon

332
00:20:22,019 --> 00:20:23,419
and no one had really brought these characters

333
00:20:23,439 --> 00:20:24,859
into 3D yet, so that was kind of on us.

334
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,160
We got some reference from the character sheets,

335
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,400
turnarounds and things like that.

336
00:20:29,141 --> 00:20:30,241
So we had to kind of go from there.

337
00:20:30,882 --> 00:20:32,783
You can see some pictures of some of the blend shapes

338
00:20:32,823 --> 00:20:33,943
of all the crazy faces.

339
00:20:34,344 --> 00:20:38,066
Notice there's like a burp visual right around bottom left

340
00:20:38,646 --> 00:20:41,048
where the mouth gets wider than the actual head

341
00:20:41,128 --> 00:20:42,128
as far as the geometry.

342
00:20:42,168 --> 00:20:44,510
So going from a 2D cartoon where that's fine

343
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:46,811
to 3D poses some interesting challenges.

344
00:20:47,832 --> 00:20:49,833
Some of the rigs you can see here with the controls in Maya.

345
00:20:51,194 --> 00:20:53,455
And so you've got these characters that are fully rigged

346
00:20:53,475 --> 00:20:56,116
and animating in front of you, obviously trying to make it

347
00:20:56,196 --> 00:20:58,097
feel natural that you're standing with them and not

348
00:20:58,137 --> 00:20:59,297
creepy is part of it.

349
00:21:00,178 --> 00:21:02,799
So feeling present, if they don't look at you, it actually

350
00:21:02,839 --> 00:21:04,580
feels weirder than if they do.

351
00:21:05,180 --> 00:21:08,222
And so getting a character's head to automatically look at

352
00:21:08,342 --> 00:21:10,483
the position of the player means that they actually pay

353
00:21:10,503 --> 00:21:13,004
attention a little more, depending on your height and

354
00:21:13,024 --> 00:21:14,945
all that, we do that automatically.

355
00:21:16,205 --> 00:21:19,307
And then we also learned that dynamic pointing at objects

356
00:21:19,347 --> 00:21:21,048
when describing, hey, pull that lever,

357
00:21:22,189 --> 00:21:26,971
is so much more, almost 100% of people will find that item

358
00:21:27,011 --> 00:21:28,892
and go right to it, versus the concept of,

359
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,653
pull the green thing on the blue shelf,

360
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,875
and people just spin around wondering what's going on.

361
00:21:33,615 --> 00:21:35,796
Plus the added benefit of spatial audio,

362
00:21:35,856 --> 00:21:37,137
when they go, hey Morty, turn around,

363
00:21:37,197 --> 00:21:38,778
and you're looking at him and then he points,

364
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:40,039
and it all kind of comes together.

365
00:21:40,059 --> 00:21:41,640
So that's what happens in real life.

366
00:21:43,698 --> 00:21:48,123
And so we got to the point where we had these characters sitting there and then the funny

367
00:21:48,163 --> 00:21:51,407
thing that happened when we were play testing is that everyone wanted to instantly push

368
00:21:51,447 --> 00:21:57,434
the boundaries of this simulation. And so everyone tried to slap Morty or Rick or push

369
00:21:57,494 --> 00:21:58,735
on them or throw things at their face.

370
00:21:59,395 --> 00:22:01,216
and nothing happened and it was really disappointing for

371
00:22:01,256 --> 00:22:03,697
everyone so we knew that we had to implement something.

372
00:22:03,737 --> 00:22:06,618
So we implemented Puppet Master and it's,

373
00:22:06,898 --> 00:22:08,979
you can see here it functioning properly.

374
00:22:10,499 --> 00:22:13,800
But it had a ton of perf overhead because it's essentially

375
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:18,402
doing like a rag doll on demand and trying to estimate

376
00:22:18,422 --> 00:22:19,962
to a pose and get back to its pose.

377
00:22:20,223 --> 00:22:22,003
So even if it's in the middle of jumping or animating

378
00:22:22,023 --> 00:22:23,944
or whatever, if you hit it, then it can like kind of

379
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,484
blend out and back to it.

380
00:22:25,884 --> 00:22:27,665
It's just a, it's a big system.

381
00:22:28,946 --> 00:22:31,688
but, and it introduced a ton of weird physics bugs

382
00:22:31,748 --> 00:22:33,149
and things that broke in the game.

383
00:22:33,209 --> 00:22:34,651
We ended up putting this in late stage

384
00:22:34,711 --> 00:22:36,252
and having to fix a lot of things.

385
00:22:36,752 --> 00:22:39,995
But we feel like that didn't work out as well as we wanted

386
00:22:40,015 --> 00:22:42,778
because we really needed to go deeper down the rabbit hole

387
00:22:42,958 --> 00:22:45,400
is that we didn't have great responses from the characters.

388
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:48,062
When you did hit them, you would want dynamic VO

389
00:22:48,102 --> 00:22:49,784
and reactions to exactly what you were doing.

390
00:22:49,824 --> 00:22:51,685
Like stop hitting me in the face, stop hitting me here.

391
00:22:51,725 --> 00:22:54,207
And like all these kinds of real things that people wanted.

392
00:22:54,287 --> 00:22:55,809
And so you got halfway there and we,

393
00:22:56,649 --> 00:23:01,693
we ran out of time. So it would have been good to add more dynamic element there. So

394
00:23:01,773 --> 00:23:05,655
writing in VO is a huge part of this. So you've got the characters, but then they need to

395
00:23:05,715 --> 00:23:10,418
talk. And so that was a big challenge. We've got Justin, I didn't mention this before, but

396
00:23:10,458 --> 00:23:14,741
Justin does both Rick and Morty in the actual show when it comes to the VO.

397
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:19,764
but we can't just ask him to do every single line and then come back and need to iterate a

398
00:23:19,804 --> 00:23:24,366
million times. It would just take forever. So Andrew, our producer on the game, developed a

399
00:23:24,406 --> 00:23:29,429
really good Rick impression. And so we would do the temp VO, that would be step one, is record

400
00:23:29,469 --> 00:23:33,871
temp VO. So I'll play Andrew's version of one of the lines here. Claw Morty, you must have

401
00:23:33,891 --> 00:23:37,853
done a shit job when you tried to fix the car. We broke down and we need you to help us get

402
00:23:37,913 --> 00:23:40,874
out of this mess. Open up the portal wall so we can bring you here.

403
00:23:41,830 --> 00:23:46,393
So that's Andrew. And then we would play test that and see what connected with people and

404
00:23:46,413 --> 00:23:49,395
whether they missed, they were confused here and then we realized, oh, you need to

405
00:23:49,415 --> 00:23:53,597
change this word around and we'd do it again. And then we'd send it over to Justin and he

406
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:59,341
would re-record that line with his extra flavor slash mishmash of improv. Hey, clone

407
00:23:59,361 --> 00:24:03,503
Morty, you useless piece of garbage. You must have done a real shit job when you tried to

408
00:24:03,563 --> 00:24:08,066
upgrade the car. We broke down and we need your help to get us out of this mess. Open up the

409
00:24:08,106 --> 00:24:10,367
portal wall to the new location so we can bring you here.

410
00:24:11,041 --> 00:24:15,363
So essentially the same, but funnier, but also a lot longer.

411
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:18,665
And so we had the challenge of having VO that ended up

412
00:24:18,685 --> 00:24:20,446
getting longer and longer when you add more improv

413
00:24:20,466 --> 00:24:22,527
and stuttering and pauses for comedy.

414
00:24:23,407 --> 00:24:24,508
So that was a big challenge.

415
00:24:24,908 --> 00:24:27,569
And we actually end up talking about all of that challenge

416
00:24:27,589 --> 00:24:29,830
in a talk that we gave, where we talk about

417
00:24:29,850 --> 00:24:32,552
the writing process, directing focus in VR.

418
00:24:32,952 --> 00:24:35,573
What happens when you have really lengthy sections of VO

419
00:24:35,613 --> 00:24:37,134
that you didn't trigger on your own

420
00:24:37,274 --> 00:24:38,735
and the fatigue that comes with that?

421
00:24:39,575 --> 00:24:40,795
interactions with characters and all that.

422
00:24:40,895 --> 00:24:42,116
And so that was spatial storytelling,

423
00:24:42,136 --> 00:24:43,176
which is on the GDC Vault.

424
00:24:45,978 --> 00:24:47,238
When it came to game design,

425
00:24:47,758 --> 00:24:49,459
in Job Simulator we had a really strong premise

426
00:24:49,479 --> 00:24:51,920
for the game, but there wasn't really a full linear story.

427
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,681
We knew Rick and Morty needed to be different.

428
00:24:53,701 --> 00:24:56,182
It needed to have this real linear narrative.

429
00:24:56,202 --> 00:24:59,123
We wanted it to feel like a full episode arc of a TV show.

430
00:25:00,003 --> 00:25:01,984
So we decided to end up going with a sandbox

431
00:25:02,004 --> 00:25:03,265
that people could play around with,

432
00:25:03,785 --> 00:25:06,326
and then using gated puzzles and experiences

433
00:25:06,406 --> 00:25:07,626
to drive the story forward.

434
00:25:09,470 --> 00:25:14,392
So I want to talk about a few different case studies in the game. So in the Rick and Morty

435
00:25:14,452 --> 00:25:18,613
universe there's a character called a Meseeks, which is one of my personal favorite

436
00:25:18,653 --> 00:25:23,796
characters. We really wanted to get it into VR. So the way that a Meseeks works in the show

437
00:25:23,876 --> 00:25:28,237
is you end up hitting a button on a box and the Meseeks appears and you explain what you

438
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:29,698
want and then the Meseeks does it.

439
00:25:30,779 --> 00:25:33,860
this is not really possible in VR at the moment, because essentially you can't really

440
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:37,022
verbalize to a character what it wants and that character can't just figure out from what

441
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:41,344
you're saying and do that thing. So we needed to determine what strengths and things that we

442
00:25:41,424 --> 00:25:47,827
had available to us to be able to interact with Meseeks. And we realized that we can kind

443
00:25:47,867 --> 00:25:53,250
of direct and we can use our hands to solve some of this. So we ended up developing this

444
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,571
character called the Youseeks. So you grab the Youseeks ball.

445
00:25:56,352 --> 00:26:00,917
when you throw it to a destination and it mirrors your movement one to one. This is

446
00:26:00,937 --> 00:26:05,282
pretty funny but it also allows you to solve puzzles and do crazy things like grabbing

447
00:26:05,322 --> 00:26:09,928
things out of side of your play space and tossing it to yourself. This was a very big

448
00:26:09,968 --> 00:26:13,672
success. It's a lot of fun to play around with, particularly if you throw lots of them

449
00:26:13,733 --> 00:26:14,373
into your space.

450
00:26:16,163 --> 00:26:19,767
It did present a big challenge that we ran into for a long time before we ended up

451
00:26:19,827 --> 00:26:23,891
finding all the solutions for it. And it has to do with your personal play space bubble.

452
00:26:23,931 --> 00:26:30,078
So people have a personal bubble and even in VR, like this becomes very, very concerning

453
00:26:30,178 --> 00:26:34,503
when something enters it. So because you're mirrored with the U-seeks, as you walk

454
00:26:34,523 --> 00:26:35,944
towards it, it walks towards you.

455
00:26:37,206 --> 00:26:40,849
So we needed to come up with a ways to resolve this. We came up with a whole bunch of different

456
00:26:40,889 --> 00:26:47,414
methods. So the HMD on the head of the U-Seeks is pull offable and as soon as you do, the

457
00:26:47,514 --> 00:26:52,618
U-Seeks explodes and goes away. Also if your head ever interpenetrates or gets close enough

458
00:26:52,738 --> 00:26:56,421
to the U-Seeks, the U-Seeks explodes. So I'll show you a video of how this ends up working

459
00:26:56,481 --> 00:27:03,888
here. So in that particular example, I actually used own motion towards your own face to pull

460
00:27:03,928 --> 00:27:05,129
off the U-Seeks own head.

461
00:27:10,332 --> 00:27:14,171
hugging embrace. But that's way better than clipping through geometry, that's for sure.

462
00:27:16,983 --> 00:27:22,585
So I want to talk through the design of the watch. So one of the first things we prototyped

463
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:28,246
actually in Rick and Morty in the early days was to build a watch where Rick would talk to you

464
00:27:28,286 --> 00:27:35,908
out of it. And it turned out we threw it out. And it was deemed to be pointless, annoying and

465
00:27:36,028 --> 00:27:40,530
really hard to use. And for some reason we were using a hand interaction where you had to

466
00:27:40,630 --> 00:27:42,590
grab on to the watch and pull up.

467
00:27:43,170 --> 00:27:47,532
like a, he would kind of emerge out of there and there would be a 3D hologram of Rick talking to

468
00:27:47,572 --> 00:27:53,893
you. And so very late stage in the game, we ended up having all these problems and we're

469
00:27:53,933 --> 00:27:58,435
talking about we have people who are getting stuck and they need like an info drop, like

470
00:27:58,455 --> 00:28:01,536
they were playing around with something on the shelf and then they forget what Rick said, the

471
00:28:01,556 --> 00:28:05,777
last thing that he said and they want to kind of go back to that or get a hint or get a status

472
00:28:05,837 --> 00:28:09,118
update and it turned out we implemented ‑‑

473
00:28:09,978 --> 00:28:14,345
I don't know how we forgot about the watch but we implemented a speaker on the wall in the

474
00:28:14,385 --> 00:28:19,292
garage that the idea would be since Rick was not in the room at that time, he would kind of

475
00:28:19,312 --> 00:28:22,877
come through the squawk box and say like, you got to do this and that. And we're like how do

476
00:28:22,917 --> 00:28:24,139
we trigger that?

477
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,904
audio and then we realized, oh man, we should just go back to the watch and in redesigning

478
00:28:29,944 --> 00:28:34,027
it we changed it to gaze based so you just look down at the watch and that's the action

479
00:28:34,047 --> 00:28:39,391
you do and it turned out that was much more natural and very easy to use and it didn't

480
00:28:39,431 --> 00:28:44,795
have that location dependency where what if you teleport to or portal to the, you know,

481
00:28:44,815 --> 00:28:47,838
some location far away, you would be away from that speaker but now it's always on your

482
00:28:47,858 --> 00:28:50,159
body so it's just weird that.

483
00:28:50,660 --> 00:28:54,141
in the first 10% it was there, then 90% of the way of the game it was gone and then it

484
00:28:54,201 --> 00:28:59,263
finally came back at the end. And so it also solved this problem that we found in job

485
00:28:59,283 --> 00:29:04,305
simulator, again late stage, which was everyone felt like they were enjoying the game up

486
00:29:04,345 --> 00:29:08,327
until a point where they felt like the game had become their life now and they were just

487
00:29:08,367 --> 00:29:12,108
being told over and over do this thing, do this thing, do this thing, and it felt like

488
00:29:12,569 --> 00:29:12,949
monotony.

489
00:29:13,869 --> 00:29:18,852
and then we changed it so that there was user agency. You had to pull a ticket or flip a switch

490
00:29:18,892 --> 00:29:23,534
or pull a thing and that would be the way that you'd start the next task and just giving people

491
00:29:23,995 --> 00:29:28,377
that agency to start the next task meant that they stopped to smell the roses more and played

492
00:29:28,417 --> 00:29:32,079
around and felt like they weren't being rushed and had more fun playing the game. And then once

493
00:29:32,119 --> 00:29:36,701
again, we forgot about that in Rick and Morty and then we said, wait a minute, that's how we did

494
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:40,323
it in Jobsim. Well, let's just use the watch again and so the watch ended up.

495
00:29:40,724 --> 00:29:45,045
solving that problem of instead of them barking VO at you for the next thing you have to do and the

496
00:29:45,085 --> 00:29:48,786
next thing you have to do we put in a lot of like all right when you're ready like look call me

497
00:29:48,806 --> 00:29:53,808
back on the watch and then that led people to feel calm and relaxed and able to play around

498
00:29:53,828 --> 00:29:57,650
with the space and then at their own time call back Rick and move forward with the story.

499
00:30:02,071 --> 00:30:08,839
Another strange one was the microverse machine. So if you guys remember the episode where

500
00:30:08,859 --> 00:30:13,585
there's a microverse as a battery and inside of that battery is an entire universe where

501
00:30:14,566 --> 00:30:16,708
people are peddling to power the battery.

502
00:30:18,710 --> 00:30:22,752
really wanted to make the joke and go into a tiny scale and do something inside of a small

503
00:30:22,812 --> 00:30:28,656
world and so we built this Petri dish that you end up loading and you get shrunk down and you

504
00:30:28,676 --> 00:30:33,979
do something in the Petri dish but we just didn't know what and we experimented and spent so

505
00:30:34,059 --> 00:30:39,002
much time on this weird cellular based like you pull out some weird Rick and Morty

506
00:30:39,502 --> 00:30:41,903
mitochondria and you move them together, I don't know.

507
00:30:42,544 --> 00:30:44,724
and we just kind of floundered for months

508
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:46,245
trying to figure out what happened in there.

509
00:30:46,785 --> 00:30:49,206
And then we realized, okay,

510
00:30:49,726 --> 00:30:51,347
we wanted a revisitable play space.

511
00:30:51,367 --> 00:30:53,207
We want something without punishment

512
00:30:53,227 --> 00:30:54,888
that has some skill-based element to it.

513
00:30:55,328 --> 00:30:57,308
Something you could take back from that little world

514
00:30:57,349 --> 00:30:58,689
and bring back to the bigger world.

515
00:30:59,329 --> 00:31:01,951
and the peddling of the characters in the show,

516
00:31:02,511 --> 00:31:03,752
we don't have feet, and so what's the,

517
00:31:04,012 --> 00:31:05,653
like the translation is let's use our hands

518
00:31:05,693 --> 00:31:07,895
to do something interesting in that regard,

519
00:31:07,935 --> 00:31:10,276
and so we ended up making a machine

520
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:12,057
that would generate a universe,

521
00:31:12,077 --> 00:31:13,098
and you could see, most people probably

522
00:31:13,118 --> 00:31:14,179
didn't even notice what was going on,

523
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:16,000
but there's like a sun and a earth,

524
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,841
and it's building an entire universe,

525
00:31:17,881 --> 00:31:20,242
and that gets charged into the tiny battery,

526
00:31:20,583 --> 00:31:22,104
and so you get batteries that you could then use

527
00:31:22,124 --> 00:31:23,545
to solve puzzles in the rest of the game.

528
00:31:24,125 --> 00:31:27,106
So, again, it took us a long time to figure out, you would

529
00:31:27,126 --> 00:31:29,007
assume, oh, they made a puzzle and that was the first thing

530
00:31:29,027 --> 00:31:31,828
they came up with, but no, many months of not this.

531
00:31:34,909 --> 00:31:36,570
So for people that played the game, there's this

532
00:31:36,670 --> 00:31:40,392
combinator. It ended up being the best and worst thing that

533
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:43,913
we built in the project. We had this concept of doing crafting.

534
00:31:43,953 --> 00:31:46,975
So we have all these different items in the world and Rick is

535
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:49,376
always kind of putting things together so it seemed to make a

536
00:31:49,416 --> 00:31:50,416
lot of sense in this universe.

537
00:31:52,461 --> 00:31:56,086
In our games in particular, we think that everything in the world needs to be

538
00:31:56,186 --> 00:31:59,410
interactable. So if you can see it, you can interact with it. This means that we

539
00:31:59,430 --> 00:32:03,736
have a huge amount of items. In traditional crafting systems, a lot of

540
00:32:03,756 --> 00:32:06,580
them hinge on the fact that there isn't that many items to combine.

541
00:32:07,421 --> 00:32:08,901
because in a lot of crafting systems,

542
00:32:08,921 --> 00:32:10,022
there's a lot of failure state.

543
00:32:10,102 --> 00:32:12,023
It's like, oh, here's the few things that do the thing,

544
00:32:12,723 --> 00:32:14,484
but most things end up not doing that.

545
00:32:15,324 --> 00:32:16,805
In VR, this is really problematic

546
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,606
because you're actually doing physical effort

547
00:32:18,886 --> 00:32:19,826
to combine these things.

548
00:32:19,866 --> 00:32:22,348
You go find something cool, you take it back to the thing,

549
00:32:22,368 --> 00:32:23,648
you put it on the thing, you hit the button.

550
00:32:24,109 --> 00:32:26,812
And if the end result is either nothing or something

551
00:32:26,832 --> 00:32:29,936
that's like the failure state, it ends up being like,

552
00:32:30,116 --> 00:32:31,778
oh, I guess this thing doesn't really do too much

553
00:32:31,838 --> 00:32:32,900
and you don't go back to it.

554
00:32:34,081 --> 00:32:36,344
And it ends up being physically exhausting

555
00:32:36,544 --> 00:32:37,826
for no actual gain.

556
00:32:40,069 --> 00:32:45,193
So the conclusion we came to is that instead of being like a crafting system, it needed to be more like a combinator.

557
00:32:45,233 --> 00:32:48,875
It needed to combine every single item in the whole game together.

558
00:32:49,576 --> 00:32:54,960
So the very first thing you do is you sat down with a spreadsheet and wrote out every single object in the entire game

559
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:57,722
and started to determine how we would end up handling this.

560
00:32:58,762 --> 00:33:03,246
just kind of a scale factor here. The first order combination, so any item in the game with

561
00:33:03,326 --> 00:33:09,351
any other item, yielded around 30,000 combinations. Every item ended up having some

562
00:33:09,431 --> 00:33:14,696
property to it that would be the effect of a combination. So, for example, it would

563
00:33:14,716 --> 00:33:18,399
change geometry, material, interactive properties, yield a different object.

564
00:33:18,939 --> 00:33:23,201
But because you're combining two, what we ended up doing was ranking these on a hierarchy of

565
00:33:23,521 --> 00:33:27,743
kind of how cool they were and what you'd expect. So essentially we'd grab the one that was

566
00:33:27,763 --> 00:33:31,984
the highest on the hierarchy and then go and combine those. But just because you can

567
00:33:32,024 --> 00:33:37,206
combine every other item doesn't mean you can't then take those things that you combined

568
00:33:37,306 --> 00:33:41,668
and combine with other things. So this can kind of spiral pretty quickly.

569
00:33:43,590 --> 00:33:47,194
example here of depth, if you end up taking a carrot and combining it with something made of

570
00:33:47,235 --> 00:33:50,979
glass like a beaker, you end up getting a glass carrot. Now if I take this glass carrot and

571
00:33:50,999 --> 00:33:55,445
combine it with a hammer, now that glass carrot ends up being a glass carrot hammer with a

572
00:33:55,485 --> 00:33:59,810
carrot on the end of it. Now if I take that glass carrot hammer and combine it with a ball,

573
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:04,552
Now the U-seeks ball when you throw it spawns a U-seeks with a glass carrot hammer for

574
00:34:04,612 --> 00:34:10,375
hands. And so the cool thing is that this ends up yielding lots of different things but the

575
00:34:10,435 --> 00:34:14,836
uncool thing means that when we had QA process we ended up writing out things like this to

576
00:34:14,876 --> 00:34:19,879
make sure everything yielded something cool and then you had to go through them all and make

577
00:34:19,979 --> 00:34:22,340
sure that something always happened.

578
00:34:30,741 --> 00:34:38,270
don't know if you should clap. At one point we were like are we doing this wrong? And

579
00:34:38,510 --> 00:34:42,615
somebody on Twitter from scribble nuts tweeted this thing about how everyone thought

580
00:34:42,776 --> 00:34:45,339
scribble nuts such a fantastic game. There's some

581
00:34:45,559 --> 00:34:48,841
AI and it was data driven and we just always figured these things out and they're like, no,

582
00:34:48,921 --> 00:34:53,383
it was just so much manual work and the same conclusion that we came to, it was just a ton of

583
00:34:53,483 --> 00:34:57,605
manual work to make sure all of this worked and ended up from a player standpoint just

584
00:34:57,645 --> 00:35:03,308
seeming like magic and we wrote some AI to essentially solve this. Why it was one of the

585
00:35:03,368 --> 00:35:06,410
worst things I said that we built, the payoff was just so great.

586
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:12,214
Essentially people would spend so much time playing with this to see what kind of interesting things would come out and there were so

587
00:35:12,254 --> 00:35:16,737
Many let's plays of people going down the rabbit hole this person went down the rabbit hole of poop for example

588
00:35:16,797 --> 00:35:18,178
Just like what can I do with that?

589
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:21,421
And that ended up making the game feel a lot more alive

590
00:35:23,774 --> 00:35:28,318
So I want to talk about the, previously the elephant in the

591
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:30,199
room, which was, we have to address Roy.

592
00:35:30,940 --> 00:35:34,083
So people who have seen the show, there was in blips and

593
00:35:34,103 --> 00:35:36,445
chits, the arcade, there was a machine where you put on like a

594
00:35:36,485 --> 00:35:37,106
VR headset.

595
00:35:37,486 --> 00:35:39,468
And then when you put on the headset, you live the entire

596
00:35:39,588 --> 00:35:42,671
life of a human being from birth to death and make every

597
00:35:42,711 --> 00:35:43,532
decision that they made.

598
00:35:43,572 --> 00:35:45,854
And it's a huge branching life narrative.

599
00:35:45,914 --> 00:35:47,355
And then when you take the headset off, you get your

600
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,797
score as to how well you lived a life.

601
00:35:49,617 --> 00:35:54,639
So clearly we needed to build that in our game. Well, we really wanted it from the

602
00:35:54,659 --> 00:35:59,100
beginning to address it somehow but clearly it's a scope nightmare and then the fans had

603
00:35:59,140 --> 00:36:05,582
spoken. If we don't do something with Roy, we're screwed. So we came up with this really

604
00:36:06,062 --> 00:36:10,784
funny outcome which was to build the intergalactic ripoff version called Troy.

605
00:36:11,524 --> 00:36:17,286
And so Troy was under this kind of like knockoff brand constraint where everything was on a

606
00:36:17,546 --> 00:36:22,868
cardboard cutout and was like poorly animated and then voiced really strangely from like one

607
00:36:22,888 --> 00:36:29,391
character. So the constraints led to this great result where it was a ton of fun and you had ‑‑

608
00:36:29,491 --> 00:36:33,312
we actually were able to build in, because it was super fast to author content, a ton of

609
00:36:33,372 --> 00:36:37,354
branching scenarios. And so when you start your life, you get to choose what toy to start

610
00:36:37,394 --> 00:36:37,834
with. And then

611
00:36:38,274 --> 00:36:41,977
as an adolescent you choose whether you're going with a sports team or going down a path of

612
00:36:42,137 --> 00:36:45,999
doing drugs with these kids and then you do a lot of drugs and you get, you know, like

613
00:36:46,239 --> 00:36:50,041
you're in a bad medical spot and you could die early and then you die at the age of 50 or whatever

614
00:36:50,142 --> 00:36:54,104
and so like this whole thing happens and people play it once and they're like, oh my god, how

615
00:36:54,164 --> 00:36:57,906
much of this exists? And you could play it over and over and over and there's a ton of branching

616
00:36:58,387 --> 00:37:01,869
and so we actually used, we made a game called Discourse

617
00:37:02,509 --> 00:37:04,210
a few years ago that was all about

618
00:37:05,731 --> 00:37:10,093
a ton of branching narratives all put together and choice based narrative. And so we used

619
00:37:10,133 --> 00:37:16,317
some of our, you know, what we learned from that game in putting this together and I think

620
00:37:16,337 --> 00:37:21,580
it ended up working out pretty well. So a fun development fact there was that one developer

621
00:37:21,620 --> 00:37:28,043
essentially did most of this and in doing the temp voices, he just voiced every character

622
00:37:28,083 --> 00:37:29,944
with an absolutely awful like

623
00:37:30,304 --> 00:37:35,593
oh hey Troy, and then everyone loved that voice so much and that it fit with the like

624
00:37:35,653 --> 00:37:39,499
kind of crappy quality of the whole thing that his voice is every voice in Troy with

625
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:43,846
no edits from the like prototype version so it was pretty fun.

626
00:37:45,504 --> 00:37:49,067
The other issue just to bring up was the concept of using a

627
00:37:49,147 --> 00:37:52,609
secondary input on VR controllers. And so we got all

628
00:37:52,629 --> 00:37:57,253
the way through job simulator while somehow boiling down all

629
00:37:57,273 --> 00:37:59,514
of our input to a single trigger. Yet there were a lot

630
00:37:59,534 --> 00:38:02,276
of mechanics where we really wanted a second trigger or

631
00:38:02,316 --> 00:38:04,218
second button where you could pick up something with one

632
00:38:04,238 --> 00:38:05,619
button and then use it with a second.

633
00:38:06,119 --> 00:38:09,922
So, for example, there's a fire extinguisher in Job Simulator and then we redesigned it

634
00:38:10,242 --> 00:38:14,885
so that when you pick it up you use your second hand to push down on the top like a button

635
00:38:14,965 --> 00:38:16,386
and it would shoot out the fire extinguisher.

636
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:20,749
And then, like, for example, the mouse was another one that we thought we clearly need

637
00:38:20,789 --> 00:38:24,972
a second button but then we devised a solution where once you get your hand into the mousing

638
00:38:25,092 --> 00:38:28,875
area on the computer, your trigger gets utilized for clicking.

639
00:38:29,275 --> 00:38:30,857
and then when you move your hand out of that zone,

640
00:38:30,917 --> 00:38:32,499
your trigger's back to using grab

641
00:38:32,539 --> 00:38:33,620
like it is in the rest of the game.

642
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,523
And it ends up that everyone, it was super smooth

643
00:38:36,563 --> 00:38:37,925
and no one kind of really even noticed it,

644
00:38:37,945 --> 00:38:38,666
it was very natural.

645
00:38:39,226 --> 00:38:40,828
And so we got through Rick and Morty,

646
00:38:41,048 --> 00:38:41,969
or we're working on Rick and Morty,

647
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:45,393
and we said, okay, now we really need a secondary input.

648
00:38:45,413 --> 00:38:46,875
And both of our examples were guns.

649
00:38:47,055 --> 00:38:48,557
That was the point where we really needed

650
00:38:48,577 --> 00:38:49,578
a second input to shoot.

651
00:38:50,039 --> 00:38:52,901
So the first one was Rick has this laser gun that's very

652
00:38:52,921 --> 00:38:55,603
prominent in the show and we have it laying on the counter

653
00:38:55,983 --> 00:38:57,744
and we're like do we have to remove it? How do we make it

654
00:38:57,784 --> 00:39:01,667
work? And so the joke that we have on that one is it's tied to

655
00:39:01,727 --> 00:39:05,190
his fingerprint and so if you pick it up, it's got a reverse

656
00:39:05,230 --> 00:39:07,992
safety. So the joke is that he's got a laser gun and he's

657
00:39:10,698 --> 00:39:15,579
so it just starts shooting madly. And that was a joke, but then when we got to the point

658
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:19,320
where we wanted to do the actual shootout scene, we thought again, okay, now we're going

659
00:39:19,340 --> 00:39:24,222
to need a second button somehow. But we designed our way around it in the sense that you go

660
00:39:24,342 --> 00:39:27,883
to this, you go through a portal into this scene thinking you're going to have to fix

661
00:39:28,103 --> 00:39:33,645
Rick's car and then you end up getting trapped, spoilers, and you have to shoot down all these

662
00:39:33,685 --> 00:39:37,986
grumple mites. But what happened, and most people probably don't notice, is that the

663
00:39:38,026 --> 00:39:39,886
portal behind you closes and never reopens.

664
00:39:40,547 --> 00:39:45,829
and then you put your hands on these areas to get guns into your hands, which I'll show you

665
00:39:45,849 --> 00:39:53,333
right here. So right when you put them there, boom, blaster hands. And then the only way out

666
00:39:53,353 --> 00:39:58,235
of that scene is to die. And so you never have to deal with the dropping of guns and when you

667
00:39:58,255 --> 00:40:03,037
die you're back in the other world with your hands back so we don't have to deal with the

668
00:40:03,057 --> 00:40:05,738
secondary input so we're able to once again work around that.

669
00:40:09,416 --> 00:40:16,042
So on some tracking solutions in VR, grabbing things at floor level becomes very challenging.

670
00:40:16,562 --> 00:40:19,325
So sometimes things fall on the floor and you won't actually be able to reach them.

671
00:40:19,985 --> 00:40:21,787
So we needed to come up with a solution for this.

672
00:40:21,907 --> 00:40:25,270
In Job Simulator, what we ended up doing was we ended up having a tracking volume on the floor

673
00:40:25,310 --> 00:40:28,592
that kept track of objects that fell in there, and then we respawned them onto surfaces.

674
00:40:29,333 --> 00:40:33,136
In this game that became very challenging because there wasn't always a surface that we

675
00:40:33,177 --> 00:40:37,761
could spawn things onto. And the counters ended up becoming very cluttered. So we wanted to

676
00:40:37,781 --> 00:40:41,664
try to figure out a way around this. A way that we ended up seeing this implemented a lot as of

677
00:40:41,724 --> 00:40:45,908
late is like that force grab, that Star Wars, I put my hand towards the thing and then I hit a

678
00:40:45,948 --> 00:40:50,492
button and now I've got the thing in my hand. In games that we design, we think it teaches the

679
00:40:50,532 --> 00:40:53,835
wrong lessons because people generally just like the

680
00:40:55,016 --> 00:40:57,860
The teleportation solution end up standing completely still

681
00:40:57,940 --> 00:40:59,622
and just pointing at things at a distance.

682
00:41:00,102 --> 00:41:01,724
It makes the world feel a lot less real,

683
00:41:02,706 --> 00:41:05,269
so we don't want to essentially encourage that.

684
00:41:05,870 --> 00:41:08,213
So, what we ended up doing was,

685
00:41:08,253 --> 00:41:10,515
we ended up implementing this levitation system,

686
00:41:10,535 --> 00:41:11,036
which I'll show.

687
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:19,884
So when you end up putting your hand near something on the floor, like above it, what it'll end up doing is it will levitate up towards you.

688
00:41:19,984 --> 00:41:25,869
It won't levitate up into your hand. It's still up to you to physically grab it, but the object will kind of levitate up.

689
00:41:26,709 --> 00:41:33,254
And this prevents a mismatch where it's like, oh, things on the ground do one thing and things somewhere else, like on the counter, why won't that come towards me?

690
00:41:33,535 --> 00:41:35,857
It's all ground-based, so it's like coming up towards you.

691
00:41:36,237 --> 00:41:38,298
We ended up implementing this on Oculus 180 only.

692
00:41:39,660 --> 00:41:47,370
But we're currently experimenting to determine if there's a good way to bring this into all content because like from accessibility standpoint and a fatigue standpoint

693
00:41:47,890 --> 00:41:51,856
Reaching things on the ground a lot can become fatiguing and possibly not possible

694
00:41:52,977 --> 00:41:57,183
So we're working through kind of solutions to make this better and maybe implement this overall

695
00:42:00,447 --> 00:42:05,288
So we mentioned, Alex mentioned earlier about all these different custom play space sizes

696
00:42:05,388 --> 00:42:10,230
that we ended up developing. This makes testing really challenging. A bug that we

697
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:15,232
discovered after ship because a couple people messaged us was that they said I can't beat

698
00:42:15,292 --> 00:42:17,113
the game, I can't high five Rick.

699
00:42:18,213 --> 00:42:21,695
So there's one point near the end of the game where you have to high five Rick and the

700
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:26,778
problem that they were having was that on certain play space sizes, Rick's hand was

701
00:42:26,938 --> 00:42:33,062
slightly behind the physical your chaperone bounds and so in their particular setup, their

702
00:42:33,102 --> 00:42:37,404
chaperone bound was set right at the wall and so physically they couldn't continue because

703
00:42:37,424 --> 00:42:39,385
they couldn't reach through the real physical wall.

704
00:42:40,246 --> 00:42:45,488
So it became a progression blocker. The reason it went through QA is we didn't end up at

705
00:42:45,528 --> 00:42:50,110
that play space size, having a real physical wall there. So what ended up happening is

706
00:42:50,130 --> 00:42:53,272
because it's a high five and it's really quick, people would just go high five and not notice

707
00:42:53,292 --> 00:42:57,814
that they actually went and broke right through their play space bounds. So we're currently

708
00:42:57,834 --> 00:43:02,216
brainstorming ways to help with QA to make sure that things like that don't happen in

709
00:43:02,236 --> 00:43:05,857
the future and some detection of, hey, you went through play space bounds and recording

710
00:43:05,897 --> 00:43:09,179
that to make sure that we fix bugs like this before they ship in the future.

711
00:43:11,812 --> 00:43:15,157
just like in job simulator you have full control over every object meaning you can just

712
00:43:15,237 --> 00:43:19,823
chuck things. In a game like Rick and Morty where there's puzzles, there's objects that are

713
00:43:20,124 --> 00:43:24,570
sometimes important and sometimes, and by sometimes I mean all the time, people will take

714
00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:26,232
these important items and chuck them out the window.

715
00:43:27,134 --> 00:43:30,617
So we needed to handle this. So we ended up having a few systems to handle this. We ended up

716
00:43:30,637 --> 00:43:35,703
having recycling systems on certain areas that are outside your play space to record when

717
00:43:35,723 --> 00:43:39,427
things are now out of reach and sometimes respawn them in different locations. And then in

718
00:43:39,467 --> 00:43:43,652
other cases like this where you go and break this skull, we actually have a computer in the

719
00:43:43,712 --> 00:43:47,516
room that you can end up ordering new copies of items that you've previously got.

720
00:43:50,317 --> 00:43:57,220
So one other funny one is that there's the age old issue of if you have a doorknob on a door,

721
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,842
the affordance says that you have to be able to open it. Otherwise it's extremely

722
00:44:01,862 --> 00:44:07,865
disappointing. And so we had this issue where it's like the actual garage has a door with a

723
00:44:07,885 --> 00:44:11,127
doorknob but we can't model the entire Smith household. How are we going to deal with

724
00:44:11,167 --> 00:44:14,908
this? And so our joke way out of it was to make a show reference.

725
00:44:16,672 --> 00:44:20,558
real fake doors. So people instead of being completely

726
00:44:20,598 --> 00:44:23,362
disappointed when they pull on a thing and nothing happens, they

727
00:44:23,402 --> 00:44:25,966
chuckle and then they kind of move on. And so it's a good way

728
00:44:25,986 --> 00:44:28,329
to kind of laugh your way out of the design challenge.

729
00:44:30,051 --> 00:44:33,533
And so it was funny when we started development people had

730
00:44:34,494 --> 00:44:37,196
sent us messages like sometimes it can be difficult working

731
00:44:37,236 --> 00:44:41,819
with IPs so get ready. Working with Adult Swim was an absolute

732
00:44:41,879 --> 00:44:45,021
breeze and so fantastic and I think one of the great things

733
00:44:45,061 --> 00:44:48,344
was that the relationship was started at a really great level

734
00:44:48,384 --> 00:44:53,007
of trust. They trusted us in the VR space and we trusted them and

735
00:44:53,047 --> 00:44:56,269
they provided us so much support and it just worked out really,

736
00:44:56,309 --> 00:44:56,690
really well.

737
00:44:58,235 --> 00:45:00,396
So when we set out to build this at the time,

738
00:45:00,436 --> 00:45:03,257
there wasn't really any big IPs that were in VR

739
00:45:03,297 --> 00:45:04,717
as standalone games.

740
00:45:04,877 --> 00:45:07,578
And so we weren't kind of sure how the community

741
00:45:07,598 --> 00:45:08,498
would respond to this.

742
00:45:08,958 --> 00:45:11,019
The response to it has been fantastic.

743
00:45:11,739 --> 00:45:14,860
And one of the greatest compliments that we've ever got

744
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,761
is the amount of people that have come to us and said,

745
00:45:16,841 --> 00:45:18,541
I played Rick and Morty Virtuality,

746
00:45:18,961 --> 00:45:21,322
and then I was like, I should watch the show.

747
00:45:22,082 --> 00:45:23,963
And that is very, very great for us.

748
00:45:24,703 --> 00:45:27,227
Yeah, so being associated with a show that we already loved

749
00:45:27,688 --> 00:45:29,330
at this level was really awesome,

750
00:45:29,491 --> 00:45:31,113
and we couldn't have done it without the team

751
00:45:31,153 --> 00:45:33,257
that we had at Alchemy, absolutely killed it.

752
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:35,480
So that is it, thank you,

753
00:45:35,520 --> 00:45:37,223
and we have tons of room for questions.

754
00:45:47,371 --> 00:45:53,500
Super awesome talk. This is this was the talk that I imagined be like packed out the doors and you couldn't get in

755
00:45:53,981 --> 00:45:55,503
Thank you for sharing all those secrets

756
00:45:56,324 --> 00:46:02,553
And thank you for for really writing the canon of VR right like the the tomato effect

757
00:46:03,578 --> 00:46:06,960
is you guys, right? So imagine, I guess my question would be,

758
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:10,941
now with Rick and Morty, you can mess with physics, right? You

759
00:46:10,961 --> 00:46:15,562
could play, you covered so much of what I was gonna ask, right?

760
00:46:15,602 --> 00:46:21,304
Of where you get to play. Where is the, what fun have you had

761
00:46:21,344 --> 00:46:23,705
with physics in VR? What have you learned? What is the next

762
00:46:23,765 --> 00:46:27,926
tomato effect from this? Or maybe some of the other stuff

763
00:46:27,946 --> 00:46:29,546
that's unrelated, right? It may not be

764
00:46:30,067 --> 00:46:38,512
specifically associated with the title. But what is above and beyond all of this magic that you

765
00:46:38,532 --> 00:46:44,255
shared with us and also basically the performance in the second slide where you're just like yeah

766
00:46:44,275 --> 00:46:49,579
we built the pyramids by just building the pyramids. So totally magical of just solving that.

767
00:46:49,899 --> 00:46:55,102
But what do you think in terms of where's the next tomato effect? What have you learned on top of

768
00:46:55,142 --> 00:46:56,143
that? And give us some Easter eggs.

769
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:06,649
answer the Easter eggs thing, we have a ton of slides after this slide that are just weird

770
00:47:06,689 --> 00:47:11,734
videos of things going terribly wrong. So if there's a pause in questions, I'll just flip

771
00:47:11,754 --> 00:47:13,636
through them. But do you have something on?

772
00:47:14,275 --> 00:47:19,936
Yeah, so like, we haven't nearly got to the point that we haven't kept discovering new

773
00:47:19,976 --> 00:47:25,397
things. Like it is a continuous thing and I talk a lot about like every time we solve one

774
00:47:25,517 --> 00:47:30,058
thing and we open a door there's like a hundred doors behind it. And particularly in the

775
00:47:30,098 --> 00:47:33,519
space of like interacting with the world with your hands, it just feels like we're just

776
00:47:33,799 --> 00:47:39,040
barely scratching the surface even still. So I'm really excited for not only what we're

777
00:47:39,060 --> 00:47:41,241
doing but what everyone else is doing in this space.

778
00:47:44,670 --> 00:47:48,373
So it's a cartoon that doesn't like, has a very like low

779
00:47:48,393 --> 00:47:50,494
quality of animation. It doesn't involve like shading or

780
00:47:50,514 --> 00:47:52,796
anything like that. But what I'm looking at the characters

781
00:47:52,816 --> 00:47:56,679
faces, they're, the light is like lighting them in like a

782
00:47:56,739 --> 00:48:01,442
shaded way. Did you consider an aesthetic that was more cartoon

783
00:48:01,482 --> 00:48:03,804
like, like a cell shaded thing or like something else and like

784
00:48:04,564 --> 00:48:06,406
did that work or not? I'm curious.

785
00:48:07,310 --> 00:48:08,331
Well, so I guess two parts.

786
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:11,093
One is we realized that lighting and shadows

787
00:48:11,173 --> 00:48:12,875
are some of the most important depth cues

788
00:48:12,895 --> 00:48:13,795
that you have in VR.

789
00:48:13,855 --> 00:48:16,537
And so really simplistic textures, but good lighting

790
00:48:16,898 --> 00:48:18,679
still means you can interact and have like

791
00:48:18,759 --> 00:48:20,420
a good spatial reference for what's going on.

792
00:48:21,001 --> 00:48:22,282
Completely flat with no lighting,

793
00:48:22,502 --> 00:48:24,003
it leads to a lot of weird...

794
00:48:25,364 --> 00:48:29,066
moments when you look at something you don't understand how far away it is because you don't have cues so

795
00:48:29,926 --> 00:48:32,368
Doing completely unlit has been problematic and we noticed that

796
00:48:33,468 --> 00:48:39,011
The we did though experiment very briefly with the outline shader, and it was a very hard. No very quickly

797
00:48:40,352 --> 00:48:45,374
And it just felt more natural in VR feeling like they were regular 3d characters

798
00:48:45,394 --> 00:48:48,216
Yeah, do you have anything to add there? Yeah?

799
00:48:50,151 --> 00:48:54,854
we knew we weren't going to be able to match the style of the show exactly. And so we're like,

800
00:48:54,914 --> 00:48:58,897
okay, we're ready kind of biting that off. Let's see what we can kind of do that works best for

801
00:48:58,917 --> 00:49:03,199
VR. When we ended up showing it for the first time, we weren't sure how people were going to

802
00:49:03,239 --> 00:49:07,482
take this because people love this show so much. And then showing it at San Diego Comic-Con for

803
00:49:07,502 --> 00:49:12,385
the first time and then having this huge uncontrollable line and everyone coming out super

804
00:49:12,405 --> 00:49:17,528
happy was like, okay, we're kind of like, we can keep going with this. This seems to make sense

805
00:49:17,548 --> 00:49:17,888
to people.

806
00:49:22,333 --> 00:49:24,495
Hi, first of all, great game.

807
00:49:25,115 --> 00:49:28,238
It's the reason I bought a Rift, so dope.

808
00:49:28,938 --> 00:49:32,401
And now I see that you guys put a lot of effort

809
00:49:32,561 --> 00:49:34,963
and thought into it, so thanks for that.

810
00:49:36,384 --> 00:49:39,586
I just wanted to know generally how long it took,

811
00:49:39,806 --> 00:49:41,248
how many people were involved,

812
00:49:41,328 --> 00:49:43,289
what the role breakdown was,

813
00:49:43,750 --> 00:49:45,811
and if you were doing it again,

814
00:49:45,871 --> 00:49:47,853
if there was an area or a role

815
00:49:47,873 --> 00:49:50,335
that you would have focused on more from the beginning.

816
00:49:53,540 --> 00:50:00,102
Yeah, I mean the the missing part in our talent pool at the start was having someone who had done fully rigged animated

817
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:05,024
You know characters that could you know we got away with a lot with floating robots

818
00:50:05,784 --> 00:50:09,166
And so when you have rigged characters and lip-sync, it's just really difficult

819
00:50:09,626 --> 00:50:13,387
So we ended up bringing on someone awesome Ben Shore who had done a bunch of work on

820
00:50:14,068 --> 00:50:18,772
character rigging. Actually we were told there was no person that owns all the modeling,

821
00:50:18,872 --> 00:50:24,957
rigging, skinning and animation. That's three people just deal with it and we found a

822
00:50:25,317 --> 00:50:30,421
unicorn that does all three. Things we would have done differently, I mean, once you get

823
00:50:30,461 --> 00:50:34,525
through it, obviously the postmortem shows a lot of the man we floundered here, we

824
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:35,626
should have done this, we should have done that.

825
00:50:37,527 --> 00:50:40,168
Yeah, it was about a year and a half total.

826
00:50:40,228 --> 00:50:42,969
We started on a very skeleton team,

827
00:50:42,989 --> 00:50:44,550
and then we kind of dovetailed into,

828
00:50:44,570 --> 00:50:48,411
I think we hit about 15 people on the project at the max.

829
00:50:49,231 --> 00:50:53,113
And that seems to be our general project flow,

830
00:50:53,173 --> 00:50:55,614
is that if you throw too many people on it too early,

831
00:50:55,694 --> 00:50:57,374
it kind of doesn't work out too well.

832
00:50:57,414 --> 00:50:59,215
You have too much experimentation you need to do,

833
00:50:59,235 --> 00:51:00,396
and you need to fail properly.

834
00:51:01,036 --> 00:51:03,177
So keeping it small in the beginning was really important.

835
00:51:04,976 --> 00:51:09,019
And also I should add, a lot of the failures were very important. Like that watch one,

836
00:51:09,280 --> 00:51:14,704
like it was, we threw it away, it was like terrible, as Alec mentioned. But when we started

837
00:51:14,744 --> 00:51:18,947
running into those problems, I forget who it was, they were like, should we bring back the

838
00:51:19,007 --> 00:51:22,950
watch? And it was like, wasn't this thing dead? And it was like, okay, let's revisit that.

839
00:51:23,450 --> 00:51:26,593
So every kind of step in that process was very important to getting where we were.

840
00:51:31,538 --> 00:51:34,078
Hi.

841
00:51:34,118 --> 00:51:36,499
So you guys talked a lot about concern

842
00:51:36,539 --> 00:51:38,039
about having a secondary input.

843
00:51:38,500 --> 00:51:40,320
Was that just to make it easier for you

844
00:51:40,340 --> 00:51:41,340
to port to different systems,

845
00:51:41,420 --> 00:51:43,661
or did you find that users had difficulty

846
00:51:44,161 --> 00:51:45,421
with a second input?

847
00:51:46,341 --> 00:51:47,402
Did they find it confusing,

848
00:51:47,462 --> 00:51:50,222
or did you find it broke some of the immersion?

849
00:51:53,455 --> 00:52:01,199
So both of those. Right now in VR we can rely on the fact that every tracked controller has

850
00:52:01,279 --> 00:52:07,162
tracking and a trigger. And in Rick and Morty we ended up using an additional button for

851
00:52:07,222 --> 00:52:12,025
teleportation. So that's kind of a base level guarantee that we have there. And then also

852
00:52:12,065 --> 00:52:17,387
kind of that mental overloading of kind of how things will work. And then we also like

853
00:52:18,648 --> 00:52:22,830
it becomes a little bit more problematic when you start adding secondary. It's like what is

854
00:52:22,891 --> 00:52:27,893
the secondary on things that don't traditionally have a secondary? And kind of like is that a

855
00:52:27,953 --> 00:52:32,296
squeeze? Is that whatever? And so we ended up going through the process and getting

856
00:52:32,396 --> 00:52:36,198
pretty close. Like in jobs we got pretty close. Oh, there's just a few things. And it's

857
00:52:36,218 --> 00:52:40,681
like maybe we'll just actually do the design work to make it more simple for a user to

858
00:52:40,741 --> 00:52:44,003
engage and one less thing for us to tutorialize to the user.

859
00:52:48,188 --> 00:52:54,475
While we think of more questions, I'll scroll through some weird stuff. Really gross rigs,

860
00:52:55,436 --> 00:53:05,468
toilet Morty. Laundry issues with parenting. Let's keep going. I've got more.

861
00:53:08,117 --> 00:53:17,382
really creepy Rick. More creepy Rick. That's the original micro verse. There's even more to

862
00:53:17,422 --> 00:53:20,363
it that we didn't show because we couldn't get video of it because I think it got built and

863
00:53:20,403 --> 00:53:24,785
then scrapped so quickly. We were trying to roll back and commit history and couldn't find it.

864
00:53:26,966 --> 00:53:35,071
There's more. Here's a test of Rick and Morty in the top left with their dynamic rag doll.

865
00:53:36,111 --> 00:53:42,336
Bottom right side is putting your hand through a portal and picking up the floor that you're standing on and moving it around

866
00:53:43,857 --> 00:53:46,139
Some weird stuff going on one more

867
00:53:48,581 --> 00:53:52,024
Top left is one of the earliest prototypes where we had some crazy

868
00:53:52,985 --> 00:53:57,589
Puzzle box that ate things and then it had a bug where it would literally eat everything

869
00:53:58,309 --> 00:53:59,230
itself actually

870
00:53:59,250 --> 00:54:02,533
Yeah, you have a question

871
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:08,894
Yeah, so I was wondering how many different types of motion-based mechanics you experimented with.

872
00:54:09,474 --> 00:54:13,715
There's a really cool one, it's kind of not really practical for the everyday user,

873
00:54:13,855 --> 00:54:19,097
I know maybe you've heard of the catwalk, and they have this really cool friction-based

874
00:54:19,157 --> 00:54:23,138
technology they talk about, it's a platform you stand on, and I was wondering if you could,

875
00:54:23,758 --> 00:54:28,399
if you have ideas of incorporating more fluid movements for players.

876
00:54:30,946 --> 00:54:36,224
And I was also wondering if you were going to incorporate other content like the Citadel of Rix or Anatomy Park.

877
00:54:38,513 --> 00:54:39,593
Yeah, that would be awesome.

878
00:54:39,733 --> 00:54:42,155
But yeah, I guess we've been really,

879
00:54:43,635 --> 00:54:44,996
again, we mentioned how passionate we are

880
00:54:45,036 --> 00:54:46,937
about not making people sick in VR.

881
00:54:46,957 --> 00:54:48,198
It's so important to us.

882
00:54:49,018 --> 00:54:51,740
And we also don't, you mentioned some hardware,

883
00:54:51,760 --> 00:54:54,441
like we don't want to either price ourselves out

884
00:54:54,481 --> 00:54:55,962
or have custom hardware or custom needs

885
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:57,262
to get people to play the game.

886
00:54:58,083 --> 00:55:00,464
So again, the most comfortable solution

887
00:55:00,504 --> 00:55:02,045
that we found is teleportation,

888
00:55:02,065 --> 00:55:05,006
but there are issues that we covered that like,

889
00:55:05,667 --> 00:55:07,808
it brings you to a bad spot depending on the type of game

890
00:55:07,848 --> 00:55:10,609
and whether the environment is designed for teleportation

891
00:55:10,649 --> 00:55:12,050
or whether you're slapping teleportation

892
00:55:12,170 --> 00:55:14,551
in to a prebuilt scene

893
00:55:14,611 --> 00:55:16,271
that hasn't kind of been thought through.

894
00:55:16,291 --> 00:55:20,493
So yeah, I mean, right now that's the best we've found

895
00:55:21,234 --> 00:55:22,694
at the moment with this kind of content

896
00:55:22,814 --> 00:55:25,676
is to do room scale teleportation with zones

897
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:28,157
so that you can continue to move around freely

898
00:55:28,197 --> 00:55:29,998
and then you're just taking the agency

899
00:55:30,018 --> 00:55:31,478
of switching between zones on your own.

900
00:55:36,758 --> 00:55:45,819
It's the early death phone. That's Rick. I don't know what happened to him. This is Rick's

901
00:55:45,879 --> 00:55:52,561
look at getting messed up. That's really creepy. That's really creepy. And then I think the

902
00:55:52,601 --> 00:56:04,843
plumbus got a bit knotted. Some dials. Any last questions? Otherwise, thank you, everybody.
