00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:12,433
Hi everyone. I'm Elisabetta Sealy and I'm a game designer at Naughty Dog. And I'm going to say a

2
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:21,376
few things about me to give you an idea on where I come from and what I'm going to talk about. So I

3
00:00:21,476 --> 00:00:29,039
started my career at Ubisoft. I joined the company as a multiplayer level designer. That was my

4
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,480
first job on Splinter Cell Double Agent. I was a developer for a company called Naughty Dog.

5
00:00:32,247 --> 00:00:35,594
And then I moved out of my country.

6
00:00:36,355 --> 00:00:37,277
I went to Germany.

7
00:00:37,297 --> 00:00:40,824
I worked at Crytek as a level designer

8
00:00:41,004 --> 00:00:42,247
in an unannounced title.

9
00:00:43,303 --> 00:00:45,344
And after that, I joined DICE.

10
00:00:45,684 --> 00:00:48,966
So I relocated again, moved to Sweden in Stockholm.

11
00:00:49,226 --> 00:00:52,607
And there I stayed about five years.

12
00:00:53,067 --> 00:00:55,829
I worked on Mirror's Edge on a single player,

13
00:00:56,349 --> 00:00:58,190
on the DLC Time Trials.

14
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:01,271
I worked on Battlefield Bad Company 2.

15
00:01:01,791 --> 00:01:03,432
I was on multiplayer.

16
00:01:03,452 --> 00:01:05,353
I joined single player.

17
00:01:06,254 --> 00:01:08,074
And I also worked on Battlefield 3.

18
00:01:08,675 --> 00:01:10,616
Then I switched team.

19
00:01:11,236 --> 00:01:12,316
I went up on...

20
00:01:12,977 --> 00:01:21,480
Medal of Honor Warfighter and now I'm at Naughty Dog and I worked on multiplayer and single player

21
00:01:21,500 --> 00:01:33,484
on The Last of Us. So the topic is going to be the challenges I faced and this is about

22
00:01:34,558 --> 00:01:38,339
This is really inspired about my last year and a half at Naughty Dog.

23
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:46,383
And also I'm going to approach things like changing new studios and other challenges that I faced.

24
00:01:47,123 --> 00:01:50,225
And at Naughty Dog I really packed up all the challenges together.

25
00:01:50,245 --> 00:01:56,347
I joined a new team, new tools, new country, new everything.

26
00:01:57,388 --> 00:02:03,010
So hopefully I will give you tips and tricks on how to survive something like that.

27
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:06,980
So, these are the main challenges I'm going to start talking about.

28
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:15,188
I'm going to approach the new studio, new tools, new game, and switching between single

29
00:02:15,229 --> 00:02:16,490
player and multiplayer.

30
00:02:18,131 --> 00:02:20,574
So, regarding new studios.

31
00:02:22,368 --> 00:02:27,069
Also, when you join your first studio, I actually, hopefully,

32
00:02:27,349 --> 00:02:29,329
you're going to join a new studio one day.

33
00:02:29,629 --> 00:02:32,210
And when you join your first studio,

34
00:02:33,090 --> 00:02:35,071
you really have no expectations about it.

35
00:02:35,171 --> 00:02:36,291
At least I didn't have.

36
00:02:36,311 --> 00:02:38,271
I was like, oh, I'm going to make games.

37
00:02:38,331 --> 00:02:39,792
That's the best thing ever.

38
00:02:40,252 --> 00:02:43,613
And then I discovered, oh, look, I can have all the perks.

39
00:02:43,873 --> 00:02:46,853
I can have free video games that I worked on.

40
00:02:48,177 --> 00:02:53,361
I started having t-shirts of the game I worked on, which is, for girls, is impossible.

41
00:02:53,421 --> 00:02:59,185
You always have, like, XL size that you don't know where to put, or you give to your nerd

42
00:02:59,245 --> 00:02:59,605
friends.

43
00:03:00,586 --> 00:03:03,468
And they are happy about that.

44
00:03:05,009 --> 00:03:05,269
You know...

45
00:03:06,614 --> 00:03:13,336
New studios, when you start switching studio, there's always some kind of clash of culture

46
00:03:14,036 --> 00:03:15,157
and your expectation.

47
00:03:15,197 --> 00:03:21,159
You have some expectations and some are going to be met, some are not going to be met, but

48
00:03:22,299 --> 00:03:34,645
I personally had always great experiences, you know, you trade something for something else and it's really great, but not everyone manages to survive this impact, you know.

49
00:03:35,386 --> 00:03:44,970
I saw people changing companies and quitting after two weeks, a month, six weeks. They couldn't stand the new philosophy.

50
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:45,751
For instance...

51
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,044
Sometimes in some of the studios you're gonna have like,

52
00:03:52,685 --> 00:03:54,106
at Naughty Dog when I joined,

53
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:58,010
was kind of a great surprise to me.

54
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:01,473
There was no tutorial,

55
00:04:02,014 --> 00:04:08,040
no documentation for learning their tools.

56
00:04:08,961 --> 00:04:10,743
And you know, some people will cringe.

57
00:04:12,066 --> 00:04:14,071
I know a lot of people that would cringe,

58
00:04:14,492 --> 00:04:16,277
and I was scared to death.

59
00:04:16,337 --> 00:04:17,861
I'm like, oh, we're gonna survive this.

60
00:04:18,887 --> 00:04:20,648
But you make the best out of it.

61
00:04:20,808 --> 00:04:23,549
So it turned out for me that it really paid off.

62
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:27,572
I personally, you know, when you join a new studio,

63
00:04:27,732 --> 00:04:30,514
you kind of get some time to get used to the culture.

64
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:32,415
You get some time to know people.

65
00:04:32,975 --> 00:04:35,797
And not having documentation for anything,

66
00:04:36,297 --> 00:04:41,100
it made me just go to the desk of the designer next to me,

67
00:04:41,140 --> 00:04:44,182
of the programmer next to me, and just ask them things.

68
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:47,044
So at the end of the project, and,

69
00:04:47,384 --> 00:04:49,985
And actually after a month I felt like at home.

70
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:57,188
I knew a lot of people in the project and it felt like I was just fitting and it just

71
00:04:57,368 --> 00:05:01,690
required me to be more open and going to ask people things.

72
00:05:04,399 --> 00:05:08,343
different companies will have a different view of what a level designer is.

73
00:05:09,204 --> 00:05:15,111
Some companies will see you as the artsy level designer and you might have to step up your game

74
00:05:15,291 --> 00:05:22,600
and learn how to make awesome meshes and do your own geo and you know you're

75
00:05:23,214 --> 00:05:27,038
in an awesome company and you're learning from the best people.

76
00:05:27,719 --> 00:05:31,482
So what better chance there to learn something new

77
00:05:31,542 --> 00:05:32,624
and step up your game?

78
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:36,407
Also, you might learn that you love doing art,

79
00:05:36,467 --> 00:05:39,490
and you might change your job and become an environment artist.

80
00:05:40,211 --> 00:05:42,774
Some other companies, you're more like a scripter,

81
00:05:42,834 --> 00:05:45,116
and you will have to learn how to script.

82
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:49,201
Don't ever get scared of anything.

83
00:05:49,301 --> 00:05:51,241
Different is not bad.

84
00:05:51,922 --> 00:05:55,863
Different is a great change and great chance

85
00:05:56,163 --> 00:05:58,804
to learn something new that will just

86
00:05:58,864 --> 00:06:02,786
make you more flexible and more valuable as a level designer.

87
00:06:03,486 --> 00:06:08,008
And you know, knowing something more

88
00:06:08,428 --> 00:06:11,209
will make your layout better, which

89
00:06:11,229 --> 00:06:12,990
is great as a level designer.

90
00:06:15,378 --> 00:06:15,959
New tools.

91
00:06:16,760 --> 00:06:21,446
So for these challenges, tools are not your choice, ever.

92
00:06:21,466 --> 00:06:27,573
And would you stop from working on a fantastic game

93
00:06:27,633 --> 00:06:28,975
just because you have to change a tool?

94
00:06:30,525 --> 00:06:34,046
I personally wouldn't, but a lot of designers

95
00:06:34,106 --> 00:06:35,566
specialize on tools.

96
00:06:35,947 --> 00:06:37,827
And it's a career choice.

97
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,668
I saw people being hired because they're

98
00:06:40,808 --> 00:06:44,749
specialists in some tool.

99
00:06:45,449 --> 00:06:48,730
And they would teach all of us how to use it.

100
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:49,950
And that's fantastic.

101
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:52,670
But it personally is not my main focus.

102
00:06:52,830 --> 00:06:54,111
My main focus is the game.

103
00:06:54,751 --> 00:06:57,431
And working on the best game, that's all I wanted to do.

104
00:06:57,612 --> 00:07:00,152
And I've been lucky enough to do it.

105
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:04,741
So, my tip is adapt.

106
00:07:04,941 --> 00:07:09,922
Just, you know, I don't even try to make myself comfortable anymore with tools.

107
00:07:10,222 --> 00:07:12,662
I see people using lots of shortcuts.

108
00:07:13,183 --> 00:07:15,363
I see people making their life easier.

109
00:07:15,423 --> 00:07:22,165
You know, sometimes there are some tools that make your tool look more like some other tool

110
00:07:22,305 --> 00:07:23,725
that you're more familiar with.

111
00:07:25,274 --> 00:07:27,956
Really, I don't like to do it.

112
00:07:28,016 --> 00:07:29,898
I like to make myself uncomfortable,

113
00:07:29,978 --> 00:07:34,181
because it makes my brain stay in that state that

114
00:07:34,241 --> 00:07:36,263
is accepting and humble.

115
00:07:36,523 --> 00:07:38,865
So I am never lazy.

116
00:07:38,885 --> 00:07:40,506
I always learn new things.

117
00:07:40,866 --> 00:07:46,451
And I don't stop anything from coming and teaching me

118
00:07:46,491 --> 00:07:47,211
something new.

119
00:07:48,132 --> 00:07:49,493
Also, if you think about it.

120
00:07:51,076 --> 00:07:52,817
the more you know, the more tools you know,

121
00:07:52,837 --> 00:07:55,597
the more valuable you are for a tool

122
00:07:55,617 --> 00:07:59,439
that might be developing in your own company.

123
00:07:59,739 --> 00:08:01,239
And that's a fantastic thing.

124
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:02,840
You can criticize to improve.

125
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,461
Don't criticize just to change something

126
00:08:05,501 --> 00:08:08,081
because you prefer the way something worked,

127
00:08:08,261 --> 00:08:11,442
but criticize to make your life better,

128
00:08:11,502 --> 00:08:14,003
to make the life of all of your team better,

129
00:08:14,143 --> 00:08:15,304
and your game better.

130
00:08:15,504 --> 00:08:16,664
That's the greatest thing

131
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,525
and the most valuable thing you can have.

132
00:08:20,840 --> 00:08:30,069
Also, now for the new game challenge, so what do you do when you start in a new game that

133
00:08:30,089 --> 00:08:31,070
you're going to work on?

134
00:08:31,811 --> 00:08:32,992
You play sequels.

135
00:08:33,752 --> 00:08:40,338
Like, I recently switched and moved to the Uncharted team, and what do you think I did?

136
00:08:40,358 --> 00:08:43,301
I played Uncharted 1, 2, and 3.

137
00:08:44,202 --> 00:08:45,503
Big sacrifice, right?

138
00:08:45,964 --> 00:08:46,204
Yeah.

139
00:08:47,337 --> 00:08:50,478
Anyways, what do you do?

140
00:08:50,538 --> 00:08:52,298
This is what I call doing your homework.

141
00:08:52,898 --> 00:08:55,939
This is where you study the game, discover the game,

142
00:08:56,039 --> 00:08:58,659
learn the game, and criticize it.

143
00:08:59,259 --> 00:09:01,180
Find out what you would have done better.

144
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,440
Find out what is stellar about the game

145
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,800
and you have to preserve.

146
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:08,681
Find out the things that you could expand and add

147
00:09:08,741 --> 00:09:11,641
to the game and make it even better than what it was.

148
00:09:12,882 --> 00:09:15,882
That said, sometimes you might work on a new IP.

149
00:09:17,522 --> 00:09:19,765
and there might not be nothing playable.

150
00:09:20,445 --> 00:09:24,209
So at that point, what you do is listen.

151
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:29,154
The first weeks, the first month in The Last of Us,

152
00:09:29,274 --> 00:09:32,277
I just listened to everything that everybody was saying.

153
00:09:32,337 --> 00:09:34,359
I wouldn't even put my headphones on,

154
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:37,362
and I was just full radar mode,

155
00:09:37,462 --> 00:09:40,365
just trying to catch everything from the game.

156
00:09:42,607 --> 00:09:49,592
Tons of questions to the people who had the ideas for the game find out everything just don't stop

157
00:09:50,212 --> 00:09:55,556
When I joined the last of us everybody was super stressed. This was really intense

158
00:09:56,517 --> 00:10:03,442
It was really focused and everybody was pushing their time try to put every single bit of their

159
00:10:03,762 --> 00:10:05,063
Time they had on the game

160
00:10:05,678 --> 00:10:07,879
And it was really intimidating approaching them.

161
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,500
But if you approach them, they're

162
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,861
going to be happy because you're making the game better.

163
00:10:14,241 --> 00:10:16,661
You're going to help them make the game better.

164
00:10:16,741 --> 00:10:18,442
So you're welcome to ask them questions.

165
00:10:18,482 --> 00:10:21,023
And they're going to be super happy to help you.

166
00:10:21,503 --> 00:10:24,704
So you can understand the game, find out what it is about.

167
00:10:25,124 --> 00:10:26,944
Because you're the level designer

168
00:10:27,004 --> 00:10:28,525
and the play is in your hands.

169
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,006
For a single player multiplayer as

170
00:10:34,738 --> 00:10:38,063
I told you before, I switched various amount of time.

171
00:10:38,083 --> 00:10:40,526
I started as a multiplayer level designer.

172
00:10:41,267 --> 00:10:45,453
And some people are going to be loving their single player,

173
00:10:45,473 --> 00:10:49,899
and some people are going to be multiplayer only.

174
00:10:51,186 --> 00:10:58,769
super specialized, but to me, versatility is the greatest thing, not only for the company

175
00:10:58,809 --> 00:11:05,331
because I'm a better value for the company, but for me, I take a break. I learn new things.

176
00:11:05,711 --> 00:11:12,274
And when I started on multiplayer, I started learning about level flow and navigation and

177
00:11:12,354 --> 00:11:14,254
how to lead the player to places.

178
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:20,179
how to put power weapons and just creating vantage point,

179
00:11:20,299 --> 00:11:22,101
which is fantastic.

180
00:11:22,141 --> 00:11:24,744
And then on top of that, when I switch on single player,

181
00:11:24,824 --> 00:11:29,348
I learned about narrative and how to pace the player.

182
00:11:32,442 --> 00:11:38,864
It was a great experience and I think that everybody should always try everything

183
00:11:38,884 --> 00:11:43,665
so they can make, they can be a better value to the company and to themselves

184
00:11:43,745 --> 00:11:48,466
because one day there might not be a single player game in your company.

185
00:11:48,726 --> 00:11:54,927
One day there might not be a multiplayer game in your company and you have to switch it up.

186
00:11:56,907 --> 00:11:58,268
Now the concrete part is...

187
00:11:59,861 --> 00:12:03,325
focused on what I worked on in The Last of Us.

188
00:12:04,686 --> 00:12:07,389
And I started on multiplayer.

189
00:12:07,409 --> 00:12:11,433
I moved to single player, worked on the combat tutorial,

190
00:12:11,794 --> 00:12:15,618
and did some work on the multiplayer DLC.

191
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:20,143
My start on the multiplayer, actually, I

192
00:12:20,163 --> 00:12:21,924
didn't do any layout.

193
00:12:22,915 --> 00:12:29,684
I was doing game modes implementation and I got my crash course to our scripting.

194
00:12:30,975 --> 00:12:33,076
And that was actually the best thing ever.

195
00:12:33,556 --> 00:12:36,097
I got the worst part of our scripting,

196
00:12:36,137 --> 00:12:38,478
which was having to deal with players,

197
00:12:38,558 --> 00:12:40,018
multiplayers, and network.

198
00:12:40,298 --> 00:12:43,999
And I iterated, and I found out our controls.

199
00:12:44,099 --> 00:12:47,540
And it was incredibly valuable for what

200
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,141
I didn't know was coming next.

201
00:12:49,961 --> 00:12:53,102
And also, I managed to do some cover, pass on level,

202
00:12:53,262 --> 00:12:55,162
and layout polish in the multiplayer.

203
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:58,223
But almost all the levels were at a stage

204
00:12:58,303 --> 00:13:00,164
where we couldn't change much.

205
00:13:00,884 --> 00:13:10,609
There was only one level that was more flexible, which was the dam level, and I did some feedback and coverpass, but that was very little.

206
00:13:11,550 --> 00:13:18,713
And one day, I was asked to help with a single-player tutorial.

207
00:13:18,733 --> 00:13:24,256
It's awkward.

208
00:13:28,604 --> 00:13:32,606
In the single player tutorial, I was asked to help with the

209
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:42,427
combat tutorial and I started doing combat research. So Bruce called me and said, Hi

210
00:13:42,467 --> 00:13:48,692
Elisabetta can you help us with this tutorial? We want to start and do the tutorial for the

211
00:13:48,752 --> 00:13:56,698
first gun fight in the game. And there's going to be some tutorial layout you will do and

212
00:13:56,758 --> 00:14:01,181
you're going to script it. Doing AI scripting and also environmental scripting. So

213
00:14:03,346 --> 00:14:06,487
took me over, he showed me where I could find all the playtest

214
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:11,549
in test cases and all the tutorial maps.

215
00:14:11,709 --> 00:14:14,510
So I watched them a lot.

216
00:14:14,990 --> 00:14:19,412
And then I started with this little area,

217
00:14:19,852 --> 00:14:22,794
which was the first encounter you had with human AI.

218
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,191
there was nothing there.

219
00:14:26,411 --> 00:14:28,793
There was just the geo, the main geo around,

220
00:14:29,033 --> 00:14:31,634
but there wasn't any cover placement

221
00:14:31,714 --> 00:14:34,576
because that was not the purpose of the area at all.

222
00:14:35,456 --> 00:14:38,398
And what he said to me is that

223
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:41,020
there was a cut scene in progress

224
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,201
and there were gonna be three guys,

225
00:14:43,601 --> 00:14:45,482
one of which was gonna die

226
00:14:45,682 --> 00:14:47,323
because Stasovic shooted him.

227
00:14:49,104 --> 00:14:52,646
So here's how the area would go.

228
00:14:53,913 --> 00:15:02,821
Joel and Tess would come over this way and then the two guys alive would take cover and Joel and

229
00:15:02,841 --> 00:15:10,989
Tess would be in cover and one guy was dead. Uh in this area I learned how to use the right AI for

230
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:19,117
the place. So I started scripting AI for the first time here and I put the AI there and they were

231
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:22,703
acting funky, they were not taking really cover.

232
00:15:22,943 --> 00:15:27,267
And I was like, OK, it's a first try,

233
00:15:27,407 --> 00:15:30,069
and maybe there's something with the AI.

234
00:15:30,330 --> 00:15:34,874
I was kind of shy and not sure if I did something wrong

235
00:15:34,954 --> 00:15:35,795
or was the AI.

236
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:36,976
It's always the AI.

237
00:15:37,216 --> 00:15:38,577
No, it's always the level designer.

238
00:15:38,977 --> 00:15:42,001
Turns out that I didn't know that we had to use

239
00:15:43,442 --> 00:15:47,246
this particular AI close combat range behavior,

240
00:15:47,446 --> 00:15:49,408
and I didn't know about it because I was new.

241
00:15:50,710 --> 00:15:52,992
So what I did, how I discovered it,

242
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:55,255
was like asking help to everybody.

243
00:15:55,335 --> 00:15:59,179
So ask questions, and this is what I learned in this area.

244
00:15:59,619 --> 00:16:01,541
And also...

245
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:05,963
We tried to have a second wave in this area

246
00:16:06,063 --> 00:16:10,364
after the player was done, but this area

247
00:16:10,424 --> 00:16:12,445
was way too tight for our AI.

248
00:16:12,525 --> 00:16:14,025
And that's another thing I learned.

249
00:16:14,105 --> 00:16:17,346
Our AI works best when it's in bigger spaces.

250
00:16:18,266 --> 00:16:19,747
And we scratched that.

251
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,987
Also, you know, I was the first combat,

252
00:16:22,227 --> 00:16:23,428
so we decided that.

253
00:16:24,427 --> 00:16:32,012
Two AIs were enough for the player. In this area we also have Tess as a companion and she wasn't

254
00:16:32,452 --> 00:16:38,835
really that helpful at the beginning so we stepped up their game and she's pretty aggressive in this

255
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:45,639
video that I'm gonna show. So this is the area where you come from. This is pretty tight

256
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:50,522
and here starts the cutscene. Here we go.

257
00:16:57,384 --> 00:16:57,944
Let us through.

258
00:16:58,545 --> 00:17:01,506
You guys need to turn around and head back if you know what's good for you.

259
00:17:02,106 --> 00:17:03,187
Our beef isn't with you.

260
00:17:03,587 --> 00:17:04,527
We just want Robert.

261
00:17:05,128 --> 00:17:05,968
You don't want to do this.

262
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:08,969
Turn the fuck around and leave now.

263
00:17:09,710 --> 00:17:12,231
I'm not going anywhere without Robert.

264
00:17:12,731 --> 00:17:17,173
Bitch, I will bash your skull unless you turn around and get your dumb ass out of here.

265
00:17:18,454 --> 00:17:19,074
Fuck this.

266
00:17:20,715 --> 00:17:21,335
Take cover!

267
00:17:21,355 --> 00:17:23,176
So she's not the most friendly person.

268
00:17:23,276 --> 00:17:23,836
You ready?

269
00:17:23,856 --> 00:17:24,016
Yeah.

270
00:17:24,657 --> 00:17:25,737
I'll cover you.

271
00:17:25,937 --> 00:17:26,638
I cannot lie girl.

272
00:17:30,529 --> 00:17:38,293
Yeah, so as you can see now the AI is finally taking cover, it's behaving as I want it, and Tess is killing him by herself.

273
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:58,464
And this is pretty much the combat, and as you can see this corridor was way too tight, and this is where the second wave would have ended up fighting, which doesn't really have much space for anything, not even cover.

274
00:17:59,443 --> 00:18:04,894
And at this stage, we couldn't really change much in the layout itself, so we wanted to

275
00:18:04,914 --> 00:18:06,697
preserve as much as possible.

276
00:18:06,918 --> 00:18:09,783
Plus it's a nice pacing after the first combat.

277
00:18:12,697 --> 00:18:14,959
So this is not really a tutorial.

278
00:18:16,100 --> 00:18:19,363
This is just an alley, but we thought

279
00:18:19,423 --> 00:18:20,904
about having a tutorial here.

280
00:18:21,224 --> 00:18:24,527
And I wanted to talk to you about this

281
00:18:24,887 --> 00:18:26,629
because I learned a lesson.

282
00:18:26,769 --> 00:18:30,792
We wanted to teach the player how to use listen mode.

283
00:18:32,762 --> 00:18:42,329
The idea was that this is a top-down and we had a pull-up so the player and Tess would come up

284
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:49,635
towards that direction and do the pull-up and Tess would take over and say,

285
00:18:49,655 --> 00:18:53,057
Hey Joel, come over here, I hear somebody's coming.

286
00:18:53,778 --> 00:18:57,561
And we would have two enemies AI coming over.

287
00:18:58,088 --> 00:19:01,669
And while they were approaching, the player would get a pop-up saying,

288
00:19:02,050 --> 00:19:06,432
use R2 to use listen mode so you can see enemies coming.

289
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:09,693
There was a big problem.

290
00:19:10,593 --> 00:19:11,194
The pull-up.

291
00:19:12,834 --> 00:19:15,676
It would have made the whole combat really clunky.

292
00:19:15,816 --> 00:19:18,677
And there was a drop-down in the area afterwards,

293
00:19:19,217 --> 00:19:20,338
which you're going to see.

294
00:19:23,302 --> 00:19:25,083
not fun, not fun at all.

295
00:19:25,523 --> 00:19:30,866
And the space itself wasn't really great for combat,

296
00:19:31,066 --> 00:19:33,527
so we just cut our losses, didn't even

297
00:19:33,567 --> 00:19:36,588
try to make it work, and just left a good pacing

298
00:19:36,628 --> 00:19:38,129
for the player to go through.

299
00:19:38,909 --> 00:19:41,730
And this is how, in the end, it played.

300
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,312
Hey, boost me up.

301
00:19:46,112 --> 00:19:49,854
So as you can see, this pull-up takes really long time.

302
00:19:51,027 --> 00:19:55,451
And imagine if the AI came down here and the combat exploded

303
00:19:55,911 --> 00:19:59,354
and them coming up and down and make it really weird.

304
00:19:59,714 --> 00:20:01,976
So you could have killed them while doing the pull-up.

305
00:20:02,657 --> 00:20:04,959
I'm sure we could have found a better solution,

306
00:20:05,059 --> 00:20:09,323
but we were in such a late stage in the project

307
00:20:09,403 --> 00:20:12,466
that finding other solutions wasn't really easy.

308
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:15,869
And as you can see, this area is really tight.

309
00:20:16,649 --> 00:20:18,911
And we couldn't really change much.

310
00:20:19,411 --> 00:20:22,674
And here we get to the point that there is a drop down

311
00:20:22,894 --> 00:20:24,475
and there is another combat.

312
00:20:24,835 --> 00:20:27,417
And that would have ruined pretty much everything

313
00:20:27,457 --> 00:20:28,838
in the next setup.

314
00:20:32,221 --> 00:20:33,862
And here is the second encounter,

315
00:20:33,922 --> 00:20:35,283
which is actually my favorite.

316
00:20:37,535 --> 00:20:44,999
I didn't do much layout changes here, but I did a lot of cover changes and a lot of AI

317
00:20:45,019 --> 00:20:51,663
scripting. So, the main problem with the area after the playtest, after analyzing the

318
00:20:51,723 --> 00:20:58,566
playtest, was that all the enemy AI was inside the warehouse, so it wasn't really

319
00:20:58,626 --> 00:21:04,289
showcasing outside. And the player would just engage combat.

320
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:08,211
And that's not what we wanted for this area.

321
00:21:08,251 --> 00:21:10,993
This area, actually, we wanted to have the player

322
00:21:11,053 --> 00:21:14,715
to learn how to grab, drag, and kill stealthy.

323
00:21:15,436 --> 00:21:17,477
So we took another approach.

324
00:21:18,978 --> 00:21:23,601
We got the AI that was inside of the warehouse to move around

325
00:21:23,701 --> 00:21:26,323
so you could see them from the windows outside.

326
00:21:26,803 --> 00:21:30,786
And also, we got two guys coming towards the player,

327
00:21:30,866 --> 00:21:34,868
so hoping that the player wouldn't be compelled to get

328
00:21:36,756 --> 00:21:42,880
start shooting. And we also placed them facing conveniently other places so you could just

329
00:21:43,401 --> 00:21:51,326
stealth kill them. And that would make also this area a bit unnecessary uh was too big and

330
00:21:51,426 --> 00:21:58,251
too like distracting for the player. And we had this iteration just play tested and we spotted

331
00:21:58,651 --> 00:21:59,732
lots of problem with it.

332
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,382
First of all, the player started shooting.

333
00:22:03,622 --> 00:22:05,503
There was a guy in front of him, and you have a gun.

334
00:22:06,023 --> 00:22:06,804
So you shoot at it.

335
00:22:08,184 --> 00:22:12,547
And that didn't quite work well.

336
00:22:12,567 --> 00:22:15,969
Also, they were close, but not too close.

337
00:22:16,489 --> 00:22:18,930
And you still felt like, oh, yeah, I can handle them.

338
00:22:18,950 --> 00:22:20,011
I'm going to fight them.

339
00:22:20,331 --> 00:22:20,471
No.

340
00:22:21,792 --> 00:22:22,392
Scratch that.

341
00:22:23,053 --> 00:22:24,373
Let's try another approach.

342
00:22:26,274 --> 00:22:27,295
We kept the area.

343
00:22:28,216 --> 00:22:28,736
And we had

344
00:22:29,375 --> 00:22:31,976
the enemy eye coming towards you again,

345
00:22:32,316 --> 00:22:33,856
but not stopping in front of you,

346
00:22:33,936 --> 00:22:36,137
so you weren't compelled to headshot them.

347
00:22:36,537 --> 00:22:37,917
They would go on the side,

348
00:22:37,977 --> 00:22:39,638
so we used the side of the truck,

349
00:22:40,678 --> 00:22:43,658
and also one enemy eye would come over

350
00:22:43,758 --> 00:22:45,739
and place himself on the side

351
00:22:45,899 --> 00:22:48,559
and just be looking at fantastic crates,

352
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:51,380
which is great for the player.

353
00:22:53,666 --> 00:22:59,291
I'm a firm believer of leading by example and I try to do it as much as I can.

354
00:23:00,272 --> 00:23:05,197
So I had Tess to set the tone for the area.

355
00:23:05,397 --> 00:23:09,661
Tess was gonna go and take down a guy for you.

356
00:23:10,101 --> 00:23:14,145
And that was making the difference actually.

357
00:23:14,725 --> 00:23:19,750
So she would tell you to sneak out with her and.

358
00:23:21,057 --> 00:23:24,219
She would take another cover position next to the warehouse.

359
00:23:24,439 --> 00:23:28,481
So here you can go and take down the guy over the truck that

360
00:23:28,541 --> 00:23:29,862
is doing his patrolling.

361
00:23:30,482 --> 00:23:33,924
Or you can approach the area where Tess is in,

362
00:23:34,784 --> 00:23:37,325
and there would be a trigger all around that area.

363
00:23:38,526 --> 00:23:41,548
So when the player approached that place,

364
00:23:41,788 --> 00:23:45,229
the two enemies AI would go and talk to each other.

365
00:23:46,150 --> 00:23:48,871
And Tess would take the position in the room.

366
00:23:49,472 --> 00:23:52,213
to make sure she's going to help you with the kill.

367
00:23:52,813 --> 00:23:54,814
So she's still setting the tone for you.

368
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:59,216
And after that, she would say, I take one, you take the other.

369
00:23:59,236 --> 00:24:02,897
And if you manage to do a stealth kill,

370
00:24:03,017 --> 00:24:05,098
she would shoot the other guy.

371
00:24:05,218 --> 00:24:08,819
So really what the player was going to have to do

372
00:24:08,899 --> 00:24:11,020
was killing two guys total, which is.

373
00:24:12,216 --> 00:24:15,619
a good amount for the second combat,

374
00:24:15,839 --> 00:24:17,821
and also if the combat exploded,

375
00:24:18,682 --> 00:24:23,386
you had very few enemies left.

376
00:24:24,207 --> 00:24:27,330
Also, one thing to mention is that,

377
00:24:27,450 --> 00:24:31,294
since our AI, now I knew that it works best on bigger areas,

378
00:24:31,734 --> 00:24:36,038
cutting the left area with a truck was kind of a mistake

379
00:24:36,138 --> 00:24:36,418
because...

380
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:41,912
If the combat starts, it's always better to have options,

381
00:24:42,092 --> 00:24:45,074
and you can also hide from the guys.

382
00:24:45,634 --> 00:24:47,295
And this is how it plays in the end.

383
00:24:54,280 --> 00:24:55,320
More of Robert's guys.

384
00:24:55,580 --> 00:24:56,981
So here the player walks.

385
00:24:57,562 --> 00:24:59,443
Two of our guys died trying to take Tessa.

386
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:02,205
Guarantee that she and Joel are on their way here

387
00:25:02,265 --> 00:25:03,205
right now to get Robert.

388
00:25:04,325 --> 00:25:10,007
And here the player has free range of comma, so he's free to look at where the AI goes,

389
00:25:10,347 --> 00:25:16,409
and also to look at Tess doing her ninja move.

390
00:25:22,891 --> 00:25:25,712
So this is me playing, I like to kill this guy.

391
00:25:27,112 --> 00:25:31,634
First. Second, just drag grab and kill him.

392
00:25:37,555 --> 00:25:44,081
I have less people spotting me in case I go and kill the guys in the room and his patrolling

393
00:25:44,141 --> 00:25:45,682
around is not really safe.

394
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:53,349
So here I approach this area, this side, but I'm gonna go and turn all the other sides

395
00:25:53,469 --> 00:25:58,134
so you know I'm not lying and Tess really says that she's gonna kill the other guy.

396
00:26:03,550 --> 00:26:06,592
Yep, I lined them up against the wall and bang, bang, bang.

397
00:26:06,612 --> 00:26:08,273
Executed all of them.

398
00:26:11,455 --> 00:26:12,935
You take one out, I'll take the other.

399
00:26:14,476 --> 00:26:15,717
They're cracking down on him hard.

400
00:26:17,578 --> 00:26:19,499
I got a cousin with him.

401
00:26:19,579 --> 00:26:19,880
Seriously?

402
00:26:20,720 --> 00:26:23,001
Yeah. Idiot thinks he's gonna save the world.

403
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:25,103
Hope he's alright.

404
00:26:29,145 --> 00:26:34,708
Take it easy, see?

405
00:26:36,729 --> 00:26:37,830
Thank you Anthony.

406
00:26:39,591 --> 00:26:50,178
Is our game designer Naughty Doggy helped me in this area to hook up Tess and make her look awesome?

407
00:26:50,198 --> 00:26:55,401
And we go to the third encounter, which was the trickiest of all for me.

408
00:26:57,425 --> 00:27:01,008
This area actually did change very, very little.

409
00:27:01,028 --> 00:27:08,713
I did some cover plus in the interiors, but the whole setup was pretty fixed.

410
00:27:08,833 --> 00:27:14,877
The level was far in production, and it wasn't really much I could have done to change the

411
00:27:15,097 --> 00:27:15,558
layout.

412
00:27:17,368 --> 00:27:22,011
I did what I could do, which is improve some things,

413
00:27:22,651 --> 00:27:23,612
like the AI.

414
00:27:24,032 --> 00:27:27,454
So I looked at the problem with this space and

415
00:27:29,238 --> 00:27:37,062
Again, like the other places, the player couldn't really tell which was the threat, how many

416
00:27:37,702 --> 00:27:40,663
enemies they will have to face if they started combat.

417
00:27:41,264 --> 00:27:44,765
And they ended up getting overwhelmed in tight spaces.

418
00:27:45,165 --> 00:27:49,888
And there are like three spaces in this area and they're quite tight.

419
00:27:50,408 --> 00:27:52,409
So starting a combat is not ideal.

420
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:58,191
And what I did, like in the other area, was showcasing the enemies.

421
00:27:58,771 --> 00:28:05,414
But in this area particularly, we were introducing destructible, which is bottles and bricks.

422
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:14,477
And since I believe in leading by example, I had Tess throwing a bottle for you and doing a combo kill again.

423
00:28:15,428 --> 00:28:22,329
Unfortunately, I didn't know that that wouldn't work because of our systems having tasks doing an

424
00:28:22,409 --> 00:28:31,251
animation and if the player was trolling her, she would end up doing very bad bugs and I had to

425
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:37,473
remove it. So that was not an option, sadly. So the only thing we could have done was putting a

426
00:28:37,513 --> 00:28:42,214
lot of throwables around at player height and hoping the player would...

427
00:28:42,914 --> 00:28:45,455
take them and also give them a chance to use it.

428
00:28:45,535 --> 00:28:48,716
Like, as you can see in the warehouse on the left,

429
00:28:49,476 --> 00:28:52,257
I have two enemies AI that look at each other.

430
00:28:52,757 --> 00:28:55,098
So you have kind of to distract one

431
00:28:55,198 --> 00:28:56,718
if you don't want to start a combat.

432
00:28:58,318 --> 00:29:01,399
So the other AI would take convenient position.

433
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,180
One of the guy would go back inside

434
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:07,641
and the other one would take also cover inside.

435
00:29:08,141 --> 00:29:09,342
But I'm not gonna put any...

436
00:29:11,723 --> 00:29:17,767
other lines because this is all up to the player. Actually this is not script except for

437
00:29:17,867 --> 00:29:29,075
following you and helping you in this thing but this is how it plays. So as you can see I have

438
00:29:29,135 --> 00:29:34,858
the AI coming towards you. Not inviting the player to just engage combat. There are three.

439
00:29:41,309 --> 00:29:46,171
and also inviting the player to take the stealthy route.

440
00:29:46,391 --> 00:29:48,732
We also place this guy outside there.

441
00:29:51,193 --> 00:29:55,875
But you have to reiterate on drug, rob, and killing.

442
00:29:55,935 --> 00:30:01,677
So the other group don't spot you.

443
00:30:20,138 --> 00:30:26,921
So as you can see there are plenty of throwables, but Yatas is not really helping in any way,

444
00:30:27,841 --> 00:30:32,643
which actually makes the player fairly alone if he wants to take this stealthy approach.

445
00:30:48,908 --> 00:30:53,129
So I hide this guy in case the other guys start looking for him.

446
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:58,870
And then I proceed splitting up the two guys talking.

447
00:31:23,659 --> 00:31:25,420
You hear that? It came from over there!

448
00:31:32,083 --> 00:31:42,828
You got anything? Anything?

449
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:49,392
I'm in for something.

450
00:32:08,174 --> 00:32:16,937
So I ended up using one throwable for two guys, and I actually do a mistake from my

451
00:32:16,977 --> 00:32:18,577
play right now.

452
00:32:18,597 --> 00:32:27,260
I get the last guy spot me, but it kind of worked out really well because I'm using the

453
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:31,742
destructible in another way, which is my favorite way, to be honest.

454
00:32:44,359 --> 00:32:48,962
So yeah, he's coming and thankfully there's a bottle right behind me.

455
00:32:51,483 --> 00:32:55,906
And I throw it in his face, which is awesome.

456
00:33:00,209 --> 00:33:04,392
And as you can see, it's pretty tight spaces all around, so...

457
00:33:05,433 --> 00:33:07,194
Really starting combat wasn't ideal.

458
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:12,823
And this is the fourth encounter, which is the dock

459
00:33:12,863 --> 00:33:16,305
encounter, and is the one that I changed the most in terms

460
00:33:16,365 --> 00:33:16,986
of layout.

461
00:33:19,692 --> 00:33:21,892
Do you see the water over there?

462
00:33:21,912 --> 00:33:23,793
That water wasn't water.

463
00:33:24,033 --> 00:33:27,715
It was a humongous space with lots of AI.

464
00:33:28,775 --> 00:33:32,377
This area had also the shipping containers.

465
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,138
They were two tires, and you could go on top of them.

466
00:33:36,218 --> 00:33:37,819
So it was really two floors.

467
00:33:38,719 --> 00:33:41,500
And it created a very overwhelming space

468
00:33:41,600 --> 00:33:42,681
for the player.

469
00:33:43,341 --> 00:33:46,742
And latest results showed that a lot of players

470
00:33:46,862 --> 00:33:47,823
just died in there.

471
00:33:49,183 --> 00:33:51,484
which highlighted a few problems.

472
00:33:51,604 --> 00:33:52,665
It wasn't just that.

473
00:33:53,165 --> 00:33:58,127
The area was too big, and so I closed off part of it.

474
00:33:58,187 --> 00:33:59,628
I removed one layer of it,

475
00:34:00,008 --> 00:34:02,889
and I also made the boat unplayable.

476
00:34:03,550 --> 00:34:03,930
Sad.

477
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:05,050
I like boats.

478
00:34:05,931 --> 00:34:06,171
But.

479
00:34:07,704 --> 00:34:15,190
it had to be done and also I scratched out all the AI that was there and just picked my bottles

480
00:34:15,531 --> 00:34:24,198
and took just enough AI that I needed. So this is how it ended up to be and the main problem

481
00:34:24,318 --> 00:34:31,584
actually of this area was another one. It was a layout problem. It was that, so do you see where

482
00:34:31,744 --> 00:34:32,745
Tess and Joel are?

483
00:34:33,819 --> 00:34:37,381
That is an elevated position with a good cover spot.

484
00:34:38,121 --> 00:34:42,943
So there, everyone was engaged in combat.

485
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:45,404
I did it too.

486
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:48,886
You know, you get there, you're in an awesome position,

487
00:34:48,946 --> 00:34:50,647
you're in an advantage position,

488
00:34:51,407 --> 00:34:55,149
and there is a guy and there is a headshot.

489
00:34:55,609 --> 00:34:56,810
How can I miss that?

490
00:34:57,730 --> 00:35:00,111
And I could totally handle all the guys, yeah.

491
00:35:00,471 --> 00:35:00,871
I died.

492
00:35:01,512 --> 00:35:02,432
Like all the players.

493
00:35:03,493 --> 00:35:11,560
So, it was really inviting to start combat and feel really powerful, but it was misleading

494
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:16,224
because there were a ton of guys inside the warehouse that you couldn't see.

495
00:35:16,844 --> 00:35:23,149
So, what I did was I brainstormed with our amazing designers and we thought about a lot

496
00:35:23,169 --> 00:35:23,770
of ideas.

497
00:35:24,651 --> 00:35:31,376
And of course, the ideal situation would be, I change the geo.

498
00:35:32,277 --> 00:35:32,417
No.

499
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:39,584
In this case, changing the height of one piece like that would have meant changing the height of

500
00:35:40,205 --> 00:35:43,988
all the levels after or all the levels before.

501
00:35:44,888 --> 00:35:49,251
Totally undoable. We were shipping like in a few months. Not possible.

502
00:35:49,932 --> 00:35:58,318
So scratch that and somebody had the awesome idea to like use the cheapest thing we could possibly use and

503
00:35:58,438 --> 00:35:58,899
it was like

504
00:35:59,895 --> 00:36:06,099
it wanted me to implement it with just one of our animation

505
00:36:06,179 --> 00:36:09,541
for vaulting and jumping down to just try it out.

506
00:36:10,001 --> 00:36:11,322
And it actually worked.

507
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:15,865
So what we do here, we make Tess and Joel jumping down.

508
00:36:16,145 --> 00:36:19,307
The cutscene guys, of course, did it better afterwards.

509
00:36:19,467 --> 00:36:23,629
But that totally did it, because the player wasn't

510
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:25,450
in an advantage position starting.

511
00:36:25,590 --> 00:36:27,731
It wasn't the most brilliant move.

512
00:36:28,172 --> 00:36:30,992
Joel could do, jumping down of a vantage point,

513
00:36:31,613 --> 00:36:32,333
but it worked.

514
00:36:32,713 --> 00:36:35,154
And also I removed, I asked the artist

515
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:38,174
to remove all the cover in that big spot.

516
00:36:38,734 --> 00:36:40,735
So even if you went up there again,

517
00:36:40,875 --> 00:36:42,496
which was something we considered,

518
00:36:43,016 --> 00:36:45,496
you were really exposed on both sides.

519
00:36:45,596 --> 00:36:47,757
So it wasn't really a vantage point anymore.

520
00:36:49,878 --> 00:36:52,658
For the AI, in the first part,

521
00:36:53,875 --> 00:36:56,738
When you're in the cutscene in this upper space,

522
00:36:56,998 --> 00:37:00,362
I actually showcase all the AI in the whole level.

523
00:37:00,702 --> 00:37:03,985
They just pass by, and you know exactly how many enemies

524
00:37:04,025 --> 00:37:06,487
you're going to face if you want to start combat.

525
00:37:07,468 --> 00:37:12,853
And this is how we fix the first part of this level.

526
00:37:25,895 --> 00:37:26,515
There's our boy.

527
00:37:27,455 --> 00:37:32,258
As you can see, all the AI moving behind them, they're all guys you're going to have to face

528
00:37:32,338 --> 00:37:33,098
in this area.

529
00:37:33,478 --> 00:37:38,421
So the player can see clearly that there are people going inside and they're going to have

530
00:37:38,461 --> 00:37:40,782
to face them if they start combat.

531
00:37:44,444 --> 00:37:44,564
And

532
00:37:48,338 --> 00:37:52,282
This area is actually the graduation test

533
00:37:52,322 --> 00:37:53,623
to all the other areas.

534
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:57,406
So I needed a space that was flexible enough

535
00:37:58,246 --> 00:38:01,569
to support all the lessons we taught the player.

536
00:38:01,589 --> 00:38:06,172
I don't know who's left out there to sell us stuff.

537
00:38:06,192 --> 00:38:08,774
And we also introduced the shiv, which

538
00:38:08,854 --> 00:38:10,736
wasn't a big deal because we already

539
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,097
introduced stealth kills.

540
00:38:12,878 --> 00:38:15,400
So we just put it there for fun for the player.

541
00:38:26,955 --> 00:38:31,702
So as you can see, the player still feels big.

542
00:38:32,142 --> 00:38:37,450
And you know, for the amount of AI, it's kind of perfect.

543
00:38:37,610 --> 00:38:40,855
And it didn't really need much.

544
00:38:43,204 --> 00:38:48,987
It just makes the AI act better, being more open and giving you more opportunities.

545
00:38:50,208 --> 00:38:56,451
So you don't really need to kill these two guys I'm gonna kill, you can just go through the next area.

546
00:38:56,891 --> 00:39:03,495
But I wanted to give you guys an idea of the space and how it feels now that it's shrunk like half the size.

547
00:39:03,515 --> 00:39:11,519
Also I wanted to show how good of a player I am.

548
00:39:38,086 --> 00:39:45,513
Also, in case of a combat exploded in this part of the level, the AI from the other side

549
00:39:45,593 --> 00:39:51,298
would just quietly approach you depending on how many enemies were left, so to not overwhelm

550
00:39:51,358 --> 00:39:54,882
you in this big space because they could sneak on your back.

551
00:39:55,382 --> 00:40:01,127
In this area we had for the first time melee guys, so it was going to be kind of challenging

552
00:40:01,368 --> 00:40:03,470
having everybody coming at you at once.

553
00:40:23,488 --> 00:40:29,715
So the idea here is use Lisa mode because you know that there are six people but I know

554
00:40:29,735 --> 00:40:32,758
this level so I throw this in the face and I kill her.

555
00:40:41,485 --> 00:40:44,968
And this is my work in the tutorial.

556
00:40:46,409 --> 00:40:52,613
But I wanted to show some example on the DLC

557
00:40:52,633 --> 00:40:55,855
that I worked on and how working on the single player

558
00:40:55,996 --> 00:40:59,038
really helped me on approaching levels.

559
00:40:59,818 --> 00:41:03,421
And what I did immediately, after shipping the project,

560
00:41:04,541 --> 00:41:07,704
The Last of Us, I started working on my level.

561
00:41:08,384 --> 00:41:12,287
for multiplayer, because I knew there was going to be a DLC for multiplayer.

562
00:41:12,787 --> 00:41:16,209
And I was really inspired from this level.

563
00:41:17,210 --> 00:41:23,514
I'm not going to give spoilers, because I know that some people didn't play, but this

564
00:41:23,574 --> 00:41:25,415
is one of my favorite areas in the game.

565
00:41:26,396 --> 00:41:31,579
And my lesson here is that when you have a plan for...

566
00:41:32,380 --> 00:41:37,544
something, when you have a plan for your level, don't be afraid of taking different things

567
00:41:37,744 --> 00:41:41,047
and do your changes because it will pay off.

568
00:41:41,107 --> 00:41:44,790
You're going to gain so much time and this is how it worked for me.

569
00:41:44,810 --> 00:41:53,457
I knew exactly which pieces I wanted to use for my level and I went to take them and this

570
00:41:53,517 --> 00:41:54,558
is how I changed them.

571
00:41:55,489 --> 00:42:02,230
So, this is the bus depot and in a single player there's only one side where the player is

572
00:42:03,333 --> 00:42:05,595
Going around, no spoilers, sorry.

573
00:42:06,675 --> 00:42:10,717
So I had to change it slightly on multiplayer.

574
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:16,360
I had to add a whole layer with access for the street levels

575
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,801
to have the flow I intended in my map.

576
00:42:19,142 --> 00:42:23,704
And I also added another room towards the ticket side

577
00:42:24,204 --> 00:42:27,166
so it could really fit the size of my level.

578
00:42:27,906 --> 00:42:31,048
And another building I used.

579
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:35,269
which is where you see giraffes for the first time.

580
00:42:35,289 --> 00:42:41,573
It's this building that really inspired me

581
00:42:42,013 --> 00:42:46,495
because it had an awesome potential for sniper perches

582
00:42:47,316 --> 00:42:52,318
and it was a great terrace and had like interiors

583
00:42:52,459 --> 00:42:54,420
that were really spacious downstairs

584
00:42:54,680 --> 00:42:56,541
and I just needed a few tweaks.

585
00:42:57,281 --> 00:43:00,743
So in our multiplayer, verticality is not

586
00:43:01,664 --> 00:43:09,350
Super smooth, and also our radar really doesn't tell you if you're on the second floor or the first floor,

587
00:43:09,390 --> 00:43:14,974
which is really paranoia, maximum level, every time you go around. It's really intense.

588
00:43:15,794 --> 00:43:20,598
And having two floors is pretty much the best solution, and also...

589
00:43:25,106 --> 00:43:32,835
It was working better for us and also didn't elevate all the purchase in crazy levels and crazy views.

590
00:43:33,535 --> 00:43:38,921
And these are the other bunch of changes I did was opening up the second floor and

591
00:43:39,917 --> 00:43:44,399
just nitpicking which place I wanted the player to be able to snap from,

592
00:43:44,939 --> 00:43:50,542
closing a bunch of things and adding tons of access so the player just could go on the second floor smoothly.

593
00:43:50,562 --> 00:43:57,664
I have to say I think this is our most vertical level that we have,

594
00:43:58,785 --> 00:44:00,966
and it really worked great.

595
00:44:01,106 --> 00:44:05,868
So when I started in pre-production, I was actually...

596
00:44:07,239 --> 00:44:09,581
behind the other levels.

597
00:44:10,361 --> 00:44:12,943
And I was like, OK, I'm going to take my time.

598
00:44:13,144 --> 00:44:16,046
And then we started the playtest.

599
00:44:16,326 --> 00:44:19,488
And I actually ended up leaving my level

600
00:44:19,528 --> 00:44:23,371
because it was in a great state just from the first playtest

601
00:44:23,712 --> 00:44:25,313
and taking over another one.

602
00:44:25,933 --> 00:44:27,755
And this is what I mean for paying off.

603
00:44:27,915 --> 00:44:31,477
If you have a plan, it just works.

604
00:44:32,458 --> 00:44:34,560
And it makes everything smoother.

605
00:44:34,580 --> 00:44:34,620
So.

606
00:44:36,656 --> 00:44:41,925
The thing is that the other level, the only plan that the other level had, the one that I took over,

607
00:44:42,066 --> 00:44:46,013
was being as similar as the single player as possible.

608
00:44:47,027 --> 00:44:49,608
which really didn't work for it.

609
00:44:50,389 --> 00:44:55,271
The main offender was the height.

610
00:44:56,312 --> 00:44:59,954
It created a lot of slope differences

611
00:45:00,234 --> 00:45:03,435
that were covered by lots of stairs,

612
00:45:03,595 --> 00:45:06,337
creating lots of choke points on stairs,

613
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:07,857
which meant that...

614
00:45:08,778 --> 00:45:14,879
The guys were exposed during their trying to reach interiors

615
00:45:15,019 --> 00:45:18,100
and it really wasn't doing great for anybody.

616
00:45:18,500 --> 00:45:21,261
So lowering it, it improved the flow and the access

617
00:45:21,321 --> 00:45:22,641
towards all the buildings.

618
00:45:24,681 --> 00:45:29,583
The other thing I did was scouting for better asset.

619
00:45:30,743 --> 00:45:35,844
The problem with this level was also that it's the suburbs.

620
00:45:36,284 --> 00:45:37,865
All houses were looking the same.

621
00:45:38,085 --> 00:45:38,185
And

622
00:45:39,461 --> 00:45:43,384
It's a house, it has a living room, it has a kitchen.

623
00:45:43,404 --> 00:45:46,306
And as much as you change colors,

624
00:45:46,366 --> 00:45:50,749
as much as you try to change up props, it's a house.

625
00:45:51,390 --> 00:45:53,651
It's gonna be hard to tell which house it is.

626
00:45:54,472 --> 00:45:57,614
And my idea was using different building

627
00:45:58,014 --> 00:46:01,897
and I remembered from playing all the single player

628
00:46:02,258 --> 00:46:05,700
more times that there was this building

629
00:46:05,760 --> 00:46:08,082
just right in the area next to it.

630
00:46:09,238 --> 00:46:10,539
No, I can't say spoilers.

631
00:46:10,759 --> 00:46:11,519
Sniper area.

632
00:46:13,220 --> 00:46:15,462
So I changed this building to fit our needs,

633
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:19,745
not having it too open and not having to access for snipers.

634
00:46:20,525 --> 00:46:24,708
And it was one of our landmarks for this level.

635
00:46:25,488 --> 00:46:31,012
Also, I've been looking for bigger houses

636
00:46:31,112 --> 00:46:36,135
so we didn't have to fit it with just lots of spaces, lots

637
00:46:36,175 --> 00:46:36,876
of houses.

638
00:46:37,696 --> 00:46:37,856
And.

639
00:46:39,508 --> 00:46:43,850
I found this one, which was pretty iconic with all the writings on top.

640
00:46:44,710 --> 00:46:49,112
And it covered a lot of space in the levels, and it removed two houses.

641
00:46:50,012 --> 00:46:55,094
And, of course, it needed changes, so we ended up removing the stairs,

642
00:46:55,454 --> 00:46:58,435
and so to improve the flow, like we did before,

643
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:04,478
and removing the single-player environmental storytelling.

644
00:47:04,538 --> 00:47:04,818
Because...

645
00:47:05,398 --> 00:47:12,121
you know, in single player, an open window up there with something hanging is telling you

646
00:47:12,201 --> 00:47:18,925
something, can tell you something. In multiplayer is, oh, sniper is going to be there, how can I

647
00:47:18,965 --> 00:47:25,268
kill him? Oh, is he going to be there? Oh, I better stay inside. It really doesn't work. If it's not

648
00:47:25,468 --> 00:47:33,272
used, close it. Just be straight and use a language of interaction that works for multiplayer.

649
00:47:34,632 --> 00:47:36,413
And that's it for me.

650
00:47:38,554 --> 00:47:42,255
You know, every game comes with its own challenges,

651
00:47:43,096 --> 00:47:47,938
and you might be working on single player, you might be working on multiplayer,

652
00:47:48,558 --> 00:47:49,918
and it might be chaotic.

653
00:47:49,999 --> 00:47:53,080
You might join a game at the very end of it,

654
00:47:53,420 --> 00:47:56,641
and you've got to make the best of it, try to understand it.

655
00:47:57,261 --> 00:48:00,203
And I believe if you follow these tips...

656
00:48:01,183 --> 00:48:11,892
you might end up like me, which means that I not only survive it, but I kind of look forward to the game development madness that is...

657
00:48:14,174 --> 00:48:21,480
So, this is the... are the other dogs talking? Go to their talks.

658
00:48:22,961 --> 00:48:28,226
Anthony is going to talk. He's awesome, so go to his talk.

659
00:48:31,110 --> 00:48:35,173
and questions I think we have a few minutes...

660
00:48:35,353 --> 00:48:45,860
No questions?

661
00:48:53,506 --> 00:48:53,706
No.

662
00:48:53,806 --> 00:49:00,371
Okay. I guess I'm really clear.

663
00:49:03,882 --> 00:49:10,630
Quick question. You mentioned you use cinematic to get from like one place to another.

664
00:49:11,572 --> 00:49:19,061
Is there some hesitation in like asking for a whole cinematic just to solve a little problem?

665
00:49:21,707 --> 00:49:23,148
know if you plan for it.

666
00:49:24,048 --> 00:49:28,071
When I joined, it was really late and it was madness.

667
00:49:28,271 --> 00:49:31,073
Asking for a cinematic at a very late stage,

668
00:49:31,454 --> 00:49:34,836
I was even impressed for our animators what they did.

669
00:49:35,717 --> 00:49:39,539
They actually let me change a whole area and they did cuts,

670
00:49:40,060 --> 00:49:42,161
so to allow me just to have cover.

671
00:49:42,662 --> 00:49:45,484
And if they didn't cut it, you would see the player.

672
00:49:46,324 --> 00:49:48,947
just running through things otherwise.

673
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:53,430
So if you plan for it, there's no hesitation.

674
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:56,553
We actually rely on cinematic a lot.

675
00:49:56,733 --> 00:50:01,798
Yeah, I was thinking like with the memory allowance

676
00:50:03,019 --> 00:50:05,681
animation has for like cinematics and everything,

677
00:50:07,243 --> 00:50:09,845
is there something that makes them want

678
00:50:09,865 --> 00:50:11,486
to hesitate to give you that?

679
00:50:12,688 --> 00:50:18,878
No, we actually... again, it's about planning, it's about how you load your pieces of levels

680
00:50:19,058 --> 00:50:24,166
and then you will manage to get everything in memory if you plan accordingly.

681
00:50:24,186 --> 00:50:26,209
Alright, thanks.

682
00:50:26,610 --> 00:50:27,070
No problem.

683
00:50:30,978 --> 00:50:34,881
During the changes of the levels from the single player to multiplayer, how much did

684
00:50:34,901 --> 00:50:39,183
you cooperate with the environment artists or did you do all the changes by your own

685
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:43,887
and the environment artist was just looking, screaming at you like, what are you doing

686
00:50:43,907 --> 00:50:44,927
with my levels?

687
00:50:46,208 --> 00:50:51,852
This is where I actually learned the most about level art and how our level artists

688
00:50:51,892 --> 00:50:58,136
work because, you know, after the ship in the game, we had a break.

689
00:50:59,276 --> 00:51:00,137
There was nobody.

690
00:51:01,382 --> 00:51:04,363
And I had to find myself out what to do.

691
00:51:04,423 --> 00:51:07,663
But obviously, after we needed level artists,

692
00:51:07,703 --> 00:51:09,384
I can't make things that pretty.

693
00:51:09,404 --> 00:51:10,764
No way.

694
00:51:10,884 --> 00:51:12,524
But yeah, we allowed.

695
00:51:13,505 --> 00:51:16,245
We had level artists assigned afterwards,

696
00:51:16,485 --> 00:51:18,646
and they did their magic for that.

697
00:51:20,266 --> 00:51:24,207
Thanks.

698
00:51:24,267 --> 00:51:27,807
How does the setting of The Last of Us affect your level design?

699
00:51:28,328 --> 00:51:28,588
Like?

700
00:51:31,059 --> 00:51:34,461
Playing The Last of Us, I guess, had a really different feel

701
00:51:36,082 --> 00:51:39,744
from going through the different levels, like a lot more corridors,

702
00:51:39,804 --> 00:51:43,947
and other FPS's where the setting is a lot more open.

703
00:51:44,027 --> 00:51:45,387
Like, if you think of something like Borderlands,

704
00:51:45,547 --> 00:51:48,229
where you're running around, like, deserts and stuff like that.

705
00:51:48,809 --> 00:51:50,210
So, how did you consider that?

706
00:51:51,271 --> 00:51:51,511
Well...

707
00:51:53,097 --> 00:51:56,979
You know, the game is totally different, you know.

708
00:51:57,019 --> 00:52:02,420
You're slower and the environment has to fit the game more.

709
00:52:03,141 --> 00:52:08,202
So you know the player is not going to run crazy distances,

710
00:52:08,302 --> 00:52:11,283
so you can have tight spaces and have a tight feeling.

711
00:52:12,143 --> 00:52:15,624
But for instance, if you want to combat, you build a larger space.

712
00:52:15,784 --> 00:52:20,186
And in multiplayer, we knew which sides were working better.

713
00:52:20,726 --> 00:52:25,014
And you know, you play test it and you get the gist of it.

714
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:25,475
So.

715
00:52:25,495 --> 00:52:28,059
Thank you.

716
00:52:28,961 --> 00:52:29,481
You're welcome.

717
00:52:33,208 --> 00:52:39,293
Hi, considering that you talk about the different passes that you did through the levels,

718
00:52:39,553 --> 00:52:45,398
usually what was the time frame between, you know, getting the feedback from the previous,

719
00:52:45,738 --> 00:52:49,821
you know, iteration of the level until the implementation of the next one and,

720
00:52:49,861 --> 00:52:51,342
you know, the following play test?

721
00:52:52,463 --> 00:52:56,907
You know, when I started, we were doing like

722
00:52:57,441 --> 00:53:04,347
everyday iteration on things and you don't need a lot of players to know that something is

723
00:53:04,447 --> 00:53:12,535
wrong. So if something is wrong usually we just act on it and it's pretty quick especially at

724
00:53:12,895 --> 00:53:16,899
that stage you really want to play every second and we just

725
00:53:17,479 --> 00:53:20,701
You know, at Naughty Dog, we sit all together, designers,

726
00:53:20,841 --> 00:53:23,202
so we just stand up, grab a guy, and it's like,

727
00:53:23,582 --> 00:53:24,582
can you please play this?

728
00:53:24,903 --> 00:53:27,564
And everybody's super flexible for that.

729
00:53:27,724 --> 00:53:31,025
And the great thing is that it's the first time

730
00:53:31,045 --> 00:53:32,926
that I work in a company that is like this, so.

731
00:53:33,807 --> 00:53:39,668
single player, multiplayer, and the last of us are uncharted, we all work in the same pod.

732
00:53:40,189 --> 00:53:46,591
And we're all together, so, and we're the best critics and supporters for each other.

733
00:53:46,951 --> 00:53:54,173
So the iteration are so fast, and sometimes I wouldn't really even go to anybody to understand

734
00:53:54,213 --> 00:53:59,275
that something was wrong. And that's the main thing, just fail as fast as you can,

735
00:53:59,575 --> 00:54:00,675
so you can make it better.

736
00:54:02,316 --> 00:54:03,636
Okay, thank you very much.

737
00:54:07,178 --> 00:54:08,798
Hi, thanks for the great talk.

738
00:54:09,239 --> 00:54:12,640
Can you talk a little bit about the custom tools that you used?

739
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,001
For example, did you have a level editor?

740
00:54:16,201 --> 00:54:18,062
Was it easy to use, hard to use?

741
00:54:18,662 --> 00:54:23,504
I'm kind of curious about the process, the tools that you used.

742
00:54:24,286 --> 00:54:29,469
So we have different editors and we use Maya for the layout.

743
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:33,331
So that's pretty standard.

744
00:54:33,591 --> 00:54:37,873
And then we have other editors to implement a few objects

745
00:54:38,093 --> 00:54:40,675
to move around, foreground objects.

746
00:54:41,075 --> 00:54:44,297
And we script with a scripting language

747
00:54:44,377 --> 00:54:46,778
that is kind of similar to Python.

748
00:54:47,639 --> 00:54:49,580
And then we compile that.

749
00:54:49,660 --> 00:54:50,680
And that's how we script.

750
00:54:52,581 --> 00:54:52,801
Thank you.

751
00:54:54,405 --> 00:54:56,867
Hi, thank you again for the talk.

752
00:54:58,108 --> 00:54:59,229
I have two questions.

753
00:54:59,449 --> 00:55:02,031
One of them, I started to mention about the AI,

754
00:55:02,491 --> 00:55:04,733
that sometimes you have to deal with that.

755
00:55:04,773 --> 00:55:07,455
And I was wondering if you have to also code something

756
00:55:07,495 --> 00:55:08,296
or if you just work.

757
00:55:08,956 --> 00:55:13,558
building the AI to, you know, certain points, see how would it work against the player?

758
00:55:14,158 --> 00:55:19,760
And the second question is, up to what point do you start making the level design itself?

759
00:55:19,940 --> 00:55:23,861
If they give like a rough sketch from the art or just some blocks,

760
00:55:23,921 --> 00:55:28,222
and how does this affect your freedom to change and make your levels?

761
00:55:29,403 --> 00:55:29,643
So...

762
00:55:30,673 --> 00:55:33,875
For the AI, the things I learned was how to use the AI,

763
00:55:33,895 --> 00:55:35,576
because the AI was already there.

764
00:55:36,176 --> 00:55:39,538
And I had preconcepts of how to script the AI,

765
00:55:39,578 --> 00:55:41,859
because I've been using different tools.

766
00:55:42,599 --> 00:55:46,501
And one of the things that I learned about asking questions,

767
00:55:49,082 --> 00:55:51,783
I used to script the AI that was in different states.

768
00:55:51,863 --> 00:55:55,025
So it was in normal state, where I was scripting it and putting

769
00:55:55,085 --> 00:55:55,865
in places.

770
00:55:56,385 --> 00:55:58,406
And then I would script it for combat.

771
00:55:59,047 --> 00:56:02,249
But that is not how it works for the last of us.

772
00:56:03,289 --> 00:56:07,092
Our AI was working best when left by itself

773
00:56:07,712 --> 00:56:08,513
while in combat.

774
00:56:09,093 --> 00:56:11,375
And I had to learn it by my expenses.

775
00:56:11,435 --> 00:56:14,257
I had a lot of bugs in those AI setups.

776
00:56:15,017 --> 00:56:19,800
And that's how I actually, one of our designers

777
00:56:19,840 --> 00:56:22,982
just came by and said, why are you using two states?

778
00:56:23,102 --> 00:56:26,385
I'm like, oh, thank you for fixing my 15 bugs.

779
00:56:28,388 --> 00:56:31,148
I should have asked you, but you know.

780
00:56:32,809 --> 00:56:37,109
So really, it depends which AI you're using,

781
00:56:37,489 --> 00:56:39,050
however you're in scripting.

782
00:56:39,910 --> 00:56:43,010
And what the second part of the question?

783
00:56:43,210 --> 00:56:46,451
About when do you start making the level design itself?

784
00:56:46,531 --> 00:56:49,131
If you start, like the team gives you

785
00:56:49,171 --> 00:56:52,132
like a block stage or a rough sketch or something,

786
00:56:52,612 --> 00:56:54,472
and how does that change your freedom

787
00:56:54,492 --> 00:56:56,693
to mix it up whatever way you think it's

788
00:56:56,733 --> 00:56:57,633
better for the level design.

789
00:56:58,615 --> 00:56:59,836
It depends.

790
00:57:00,176 --> 00:57:02,937
Like for multiplayer, there is no such a thing.

791
00:57:02,977 --> 00:57:06,038
We scouted from the single player.

792
00:57:06,578 --> 00:57:09,019
So we didn't have sketches or any.

793
00:57:09,319 --> 00:57:13,761
The idea was basically feel like you're in one place

794
00:57:13,821 --> 00:57:15,622
in the game that you've been before,

795
00:57:16,242 --> 00:57:18,323
and you get to play it again over and over.

796
00:57:18,863 --> 00:57:25,506
And for single player, I tend to not let myself being blocked.

797
00:57:26,226 --> 00:57:27,687
buy some sketches.

798
00:57:27,707 --> 00:57:29,828
I like to implement ideas.

799
00:57:30,748 --> 00:57:35,171
And then I just try to match it with the art.

800
00:57:35,311 --> 00:57:37,832
And if I can't, I start from scratch.

801
00:57:39,553 --> 00:57:40,134
Thank you very much.

802
00:57:41,955 --> 00:57:42,495
Hi.

803
00:57:42,535 --> 00:57:46,417
So it felt like the tutorial came in quite late

804
00:57:46,517 --> 00:57:47,518
in the development cycle.

805
00:57:47,598 --> 00:57:49,679
But when playing, it felt like it wasn't really.

806
00:57:50,705 --> 00:57:52,086
It felt quite seamless to play.

807
00:57:52,126 --> 00:57:54,108
So did you have to adapt the narrative at all

808
00:57:54,128 --> 00:57:56,969
to fit the tutorial or create new narrative sections for it?

809
00:57:58,150 --> 00:58:00,532
I couldn't create any unique section for it.

810
00:58:00,752 --> 00:58:03,514
So I could just tweak what was there.

811
00:58:03,534 --> 00:58:09,458
And we tried to really see the problems with the play test

812
00:58:09,538 --> 00:58:12,800
instead of just like, I think we might change everything.

813
00:58:13,480 --> 00:58:17,323
And also, finding the simplest solution and the easiest

814
00:58:17,363 --> 00:58:17,923
solution.

815
00:58:19,531 --> 00:58:20,833
Sometimes it's the best thing.

816
00:58:20,853 --> 00:58:22,676
You don't need complicated thing.

817
00:58:22,716 --> 00:58:25,120
You don't need the perfect thing to make it work.

818
00:58:25,180 --> 00:58:28,245
Sometimes just finding that thing that makes a difference

819
00:58:28,825 --> 00:58:30,448
is the key to make it better.
