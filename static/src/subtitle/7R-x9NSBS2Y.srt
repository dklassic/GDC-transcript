00:00:05,353 --> 00:00:08,275
I'm Charlie Cleveland, the design director of Subnautica.

2
00:00:09,576 --> 00:00:12,557
And I'd like to remind you to fill out your evaluation

3
00:00:12,597 --> 00:00:15,799
cards at the end to make sure the quality of talks

4
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:16,379
is improving.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,501
And I just wanted to mention also

6
00:00:19,601 --> 00:00:21,402
that you don't need to take notes for this talk,

7
00:00:21,502 --> 00:00:24,023
because the slides are all online.

8
00:00:24,483 --> 00:00:26,164
So just take a picture of that URL.

9
00:00:26,504 --> 00:00:29,126
And the handouts and reference and all the slides

10
00:00:29,166 --> 00:00:29,526
are up there.

11
00:00:29,846 --> 00:00:31,287
So let's go.

12
00:00:32,683 --> 00:00:40,046
So yeah, the great thing about GDC is we look really cool in retrospect after we spent way

13
00:00:40,086 --> 00:00:46,148
too many years making a game and trying a lot of things that didn't work.

14
00:00:47,448 --> 00:00:52,410
So I wanted to give a disclaimer that this talk makes the development of Subnautica look

15
00:00:52,610 --> 00:00:53,490
a lot easier than it was.

16
00:00:54,797 --> 00:00:58,240
It took about 5 years to make this game and it was a really

17
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:00,742
hard development for a good portion of that.

18
00:01:02,204 --> 00:01:04,405
And our previous game actually took 8 years.

19
00:01:05,166 --> 00:01:09,770
So we're now just getting to the point where we think we know

20
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:12,452
how to make games and our games are becoming more successful.

21
00:01:13,313 --> 00:01:17,096
And you know, I don't want this to look like it was an

22
00:01:17,156 --> 00:01:17,897
overnight success.

23
00:01:18,818 --> 00:01:20,359
There's a there's a saying that

24
00:01:21,757 --> 00:01:24,198
You know, an overnight success rarely happens overnight,

25
00:01:24,599 --> 00:01:25,719
and that's definitely true for us.

26
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:27,880
So, let's get started.

27
00:01:29,241 --> 00:01:32,243
Before Subnautica, we spent eight years

28
00:01:32,303 --> 00:01:33,463
working on a first-person shooter,

29
00:01:33,763 --> 00:01:37,025
real-time strategy hybrid called Natural Selection 1 and 2.

30
00:01:38,766 --> 00:01:40,747
And at the end of that development,

31
00:01:41,307 --> 00:01:43,088
I was totally exhausted.

32
00:01:45,268 --> 00:01:50,111
We had a lot of guns in that game and it was a competitive online shooter.

33
00:01:50,131 --> 00:01:54,414
So people were always going on the forums and yelling at us for balance,

34
00:01:54,434 --> 00:01:56,096
you know, yelling at me basically.

35
00:01:58,532 --> 00:02:01,213
And it was just a hyper competitive game.

36
00:02:01,894 --> 00:02:03,755
And I love that stuff.

37
00:02:03,795 --> 00:02:05,496
I love the guns, I love the strategy,

38
00:02:05,576 --> 00:02:07,197
I love the tech trees,

39
00:02:07,257 --> 00:02:10,079
and intense team versus team combat.

40
00:02:10,799 --> 00:02:14,142
But I just felt like I didn't want to spend

41
00:02:14,202 --> 00:02:17,524
another section of my life adding more,

42
00:02:19,105 --> 00:02:19,985
basically doing the same thing.

43
00:02:20,005 --> 00:02:22,827
And I was feeling really burned out creatively.

44
00:02:24,763 --> 00:02:29,106
And right around that time is when we had the Sandy Hook shooting.

45
00:02:31,067 --> 00:02:33,409
And yeah, maybe you remember this picture.

46
00:02:33,429 --> 00:02:35,511
I definitely remember it.

47
00:02:37,072 --> 00:02:42,496
And of course, we've had so many mass shootings since that time, and now we have the Christchurch

48
00:02:42,596 --> 00:02:43,476
one, not even a week old.

49
00:02:44,237 --> 00:02:45,458
You can't even keep track of them anymore.

50
00:02:46,910 --> 00:02:51,255
And I just didn't want to add more guns to a game, or to the world.

51
00:02:51,935 --> 00:02:58,061
Even if they're virtual guns, even if I believe that virtual violence does not create real

52
00:02:58,101 --> 00:03:02,085
violence, which I do believe that that's not true, but I just didn't want to spend more

53
00:03:02,105 --> 00:03:02,666
time doing that.

54
00:03:03,366 --> 00:03:05,829
And that's where the original idea of Subnautica came from.

55
00:03:10,017 --> 00:03:11,758
We were also really inspired by Minecraft.

56
00:03:12,679 --> 00:03:16,641
So to me, the idea of making an open game,

57
00:03:17,021 --> 00:03:18,622
something more sandboxy,

58
00:03:19,383 --> 00:03:22,084
something where the designers and the developers

59
00:03:22,144 --> 00:03:23,705
didn't push you down one path.

60
00:03:24,345 --> 00:03:26,186
We see that a lot in AAA games

61
00:03:26,767 --> 00:03:28,988
where there's pretty much one way to play the game.

62
00:03:30,569 --> 00:03:34,531
And any kind of surprises in the game were pre-designed

63
00:03:34,831 --> 00:03:37,193
and you're just pretty much going along down the line.

64
00:03:38,221 --> 00:03:40,562
So Minecraft showed this new way to build a game,

65
00:03:42,403 --> 00:03:46,405
you know, expansive with player stories and player creation.

66
00:03:46,725 --> 00:03:48,586
And I was thinking, oh, we should,

67
00:03:48,926 --> 00:03:49,947
we can make a game like Minecraft,

68
00:03:49,967 --> 00:03:50,827
but we can do it underwater.

69
00:03:53,593 --> 00:03:58,875
We also got inspired by Clay, the makers of Don't Starve and Oxygen Not Included, Invisible

70
00:03:58,955 --> 00:03:59,876
Ink among others.

71
00:04:01,096 --> 00:04:06,218
And Clay, the thing I love about Clay is that every game they make is a different genre.

72
00:04:07,158 --> 00:04:08,419
So they never repeat themselves.

73
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,281
And there's a few members on our team, including myself, that really got inspired by that.

74
00:04:13,301 --> 00:04:15,542
So we wanted to try something completely different.

75
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,902
So we had this nonviolent idea, player has no guns,

76
00:04:20,563 --> 00:04:23,005
though truthfully there is violence in the game,

77
00:04:23,185 --> 00:04:25,826
it's just of course the creatures are attacking you

78
00:04:26,147 --> 00:04:27,608
and then you basically can't do anything about it.

79
00:04:29,429 --> 00:04:32,831
So yeah, you're definitely not at the top of the food chain.

80
00:04:34,132 --> 00:04:36,253
So that's the background of why we made the game.

81
00:04:36,954 --> 00:04:38,635
And I just wanna talk a little bit about

82
00:04:39,856 --> 00:04:41,076
how we built it, just briefly.

83
00:04:42,744 --> 00:04:45,346
We started development on it in early 2013.

84
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:48,549
It came out in early access in late 2014,

85
00:04:48,890 --> 00:04:50,752
so it's almost two years.

86
00:04:51,913 --> 00:04:53,915
We had a $3 million budget, roughly.

87
00:04:55,244 --> 00:04:56,825
and that was all the money that we had earned

88
00:04:57,205 --> 00:04:58,966
from our previous game, Natural Selection 2.

89
00:05:00,728 --> 00:05:03,890
And we spent about four years in early access,

90
00:05:04,751 --> 00:05:08,634
and we released 30 or so headliner updates.

91
00:05:09,234 --> 00:05:11,316
And these headliners are the concept

92
00:05:11,376 --> 00:05:14,298
is where you build an update around one feature,

93
00:05:14,758 --> 00:05:16,219
and that feature is really marketable,

94
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:19,722
and it's appealing, and you make a video, you make a website,

95
00:05:20,042 --> 00:05:22,004
and it was a way for us to draw attention to the game.

96
00:05:23,174 --> 00:05:26,737
because we're not known in this area at all.

97
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:31,261
If you want to know more about how we did

98
00:05:31,281 --> 00:05:33,523
this early access development, Jonas, who's here,

99
00:05:34,224 --> 00:05:36,466
he gave a great talk yesterday, I've heard it was amazing,

100
00:05:37,287 --> 00:05:40,430
a talk called Subnautica Postmortem, yep,

101
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:42,071
and it'll be available on the Vault,

102
00:05:42,431 --> 00:05:44,934
so if you want to hear about early access, go watch that.

103
00:05:45,594 --> 00:05:46,735
I'm not gonna talk much about it,

104
00:05:46,996 --> 00:05:49,338
I'm just gonna say one more thing, which is...

105
00:05:50,339 --> 00:05:54,122
I guess that we, let's see, yeah, we spent three million

106
00:05:54,142 --> 00:05:57,205
to get it to early access, and then another seven after that,

107
00:05:57,686 --> 00:06:00,689
which was all funded from the headliner updates

108
00:06:00,709 --> 00:06:02,891
from players buying the game, which was incredible.

109
00:06:03,091 --> 00:06:04,813
It was a wonderful rollercoaster ride.

110
00:06:05,714 --> 00:06:08,056
And our players ended up by showing us

111
00:06:09,177 --> 00:06:10,539
what the game really needed to be.

112
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,881
And to date, we've sold about four million and counting units on PC, Steam, Xbox One,

113
00:06:18,261 --> 00:06:20,481
PS4, just launched on PS4.

114
00:06:21,081 --> 00:06:22,222
So it's done super well.

115
00:06:22,302 --> 00:06:24,302
We feel extremely grateful and lucky.

116
00:06:25,763 --> 00:06:29,824
So this talk is about making original games, not about all that business stuff.

117
00:06:30,924 --> 00:06:35,765
When I talk about original games, what I really want to talk about is this idea of making

118
00:06:35,805 --> 00:06:37,185
a game that's never been seen before.

119
00:06:38,183 --> 00:06:41,245
You can make a sequel, sequels can be original

120
00:06:41,325 --> 00:06:44,287
by my definition, but I want to talk about

121
00:06:44,307 --> 00:06:46,068
making something that is unique enough

122
00:06:46,148 --> 00:06:47,548
that you don't have a model to look at.

123
00:06:48,369 --> 00:06:50,530
So this illustration shows, you know,

124
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:54,172
maybe when you start the game you have an idea

125
00:06:55,032 --> 00:06:57,874
and you think you see something that you want in your mind.

126
00:06:58,394 --> 00:07:00,395
And that's way off there in the jungle,

127
00:07:00,675 --> 00:07:01,836
off to the right, three o'clock.

128
00:07:02,857 --> 00:07:08,301
You have all sorts of assumptions about what the game will be, you have dreams and hopes

129
00:07:08,341 --> 00:07:08,861
and desires.

130
00:07:09,301 --> 00:07:14,345
And you start building the game and you're kind of going along that line and you start

131
00:07:14,365 --> 00:07:14,865
to get lost.

132
00:07:15,930 --> 00:07:18,631
And your players, maybe if you have them,

133
00:07:18,852 --> 00:07:20,632
they're saying, do this, do that.

134
00:07:20,972 --> 00:07:21,873
What is this game really about?

135
00:07:21,973 --> 00:07:23,033
I want more of this, more of that.

136
00:07:23,913 --> 00:07:27,435
And that can be a really desperate, terrible place

137
00:07:27,475 --> 00:07:30,596
to be in because you still don't know what your game is.

138
00:07:30,836 --> 00:07:32,116
How can you possibly know what it is?

139
00:07:32,457 --> 00:07:33,797
How can you take feedback if you don't know

140
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,158
really what you're building?

141
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:41,762
So, eventually, I mean, so this talk is about how to get through that jungle.

142
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:47,564
If there's one thing I hope that you have a takeaway from, it's less about the design

143
00:07:47,584 --> 00:07:50,165
of Subnautica and more about how to find your own way through the jungle.

144
00:07:50,185 --> 00:07:54,347
And I'm going to show you how we did it, and I hope to tie it into a larger framework that

145
00:07:54,407 --> 00:07:55,427
you can use for your own games.

146
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:01,783
Okay, Jesse Schell wrote a book called

147
00:08:03,244 --> 00:08:06,327
The Art of Game Design, Game Design Lenses,

148
00:08:06,487 --> 00:08:09,711
a book of lenses, and in it he talks about

149
00:08:09,871 --> 00:08:14,836
using lenses as a tool, as a way to look at

150
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:15,917
one aspect of your game.

151
00:08:16,758 --> 00:08:19,621
So for instance, he might talk about the lens of skill.

152
00:08:20,462 --> 00:08:24,145
So if you look through that lens of skill and you look at every aspect of your game

153
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:27,128
and you say, how much skill does this level require?

154
00:08:27,208 --> 00:08:29,590
How much does this one? Is this too easy? Too hard?

155
00:08:29,950 --> 00:08:32,913
You can start to get insight about just skill in your game.

156
00:08:33,674 --> 00:08:36,796
But that's useful because if you just think about your game in terms of fun,

157
00:08:37,277 --> 00:08:39,979
that's super generic and it's not very helpful to anyone.

158
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,723
So he talks about, here's how you do the lens of chance.

159
00:08:43,963 --> 00:08:45,825
Here's how you do the lens of accessibility.

160
00:08:46,606 --> 00:08:49,269
And to me, one of the most important ones

161
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,570
is the lens of emotion.

162
00:08:52,593 --> 00:08:56,337
Genova Chen of that game company talks a lot about designing

163
00:08:56,377 --> 00:08:57,578
games with emotion first.

164
00:08:58,544 --> 00:09:02,426
And to me, that's really about that lens of emotion.

165
00:09:02,786 --> 00:09:04,827
You have to figure out what emotions your players,

166
00:09:05,387 --> 00:09:06,908
what emotions you want them to feel.

167
00:09:07,488 --> 00:09:09,489
Then you notice what emotions they are feeling,

168
00:09:09,869 --> 00:09:11,530
and then you want to figure out how to get them

169
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:13,471
from where they are to where you want them to be.

170
00:09:14,892 --> 00:09:17,853
So I think this lens of emotion is where,

171
00:09:18,053 --> 00:09:19,934
I mean, this is where we started with Subnautica,

172
00:09:20,014 --> 00:09:21,295
and I think it was probably

173
00:09:21,335 --> 00:09:22,815
the most important decision we ever made.

174
00:09:24,794 --> 00:09:30,899
A lot of design talks talk about pillars, design pillars, and I'm not going to give

175
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,124
much information on design pillars, because, well, I'll give a summary, because some people

176
00:09:36,164 --> 00:09:36,524
may not know.

177
00:09:36,544 --> 00:09:44,632
A pillar is where you create a concept of usually a feature or a set of mechanics around

178
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:44,972
your game.

179
00:09:45,850 --> 00:09:47,091
and you have a couple of those pillars,

180
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:51,412
and those, you choose that at the beginning of your game,

181
00:09:52,012 --> 00:09:53,772
and that guides the development of your game

182
00:09:54,152 --> 00:09:55,853
for all of eternity, basically.

183
00:09:56,613 --> 00:09:58,853
So I am a big fan of design pillars.

184
00:09:59,073 --> 00:10:00,514
We've used them in every game.

185
00:10:01,294 --> 00:10:05,055
But if we apply the lens of emotion to a design pillar,

186
00:10:05,175 --> 00:10:06,495
I think they get a lot more powerful.

187
00:10:07,886 --> 00:10:09,547
and a lot more important and relevant.

188
00:10:10,007 --> 00:10:12,048
So right here, this is, here are the first,

189
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:13,669
they're the only three pillars

190
00:10:13,849 --> 00:10:15,070
that we ever had for Subnautica.

191
00:10:15,830 --> 00:10:17,371
And this is actually a screenshot

192
00:10:17,431 --> 00:10:20,493
of the very first document ever written about the game.

193
00:10:21,473 --> 00:10:25,095
And you can see the first one is Vessel Design Building,

194
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:27,936
and that's kind of like a gameplay system.

195
00:10:28,757 --> 00:10:31,798
And then to the right, in parentheses, Intoxicating Creation.

196
00:10:32,819 --> 00:10:35,700
So why do we have Vessel Design and Building?

197
00:10:37,272 --> 00:10:41,793
The reason is because we want players to have the feeling of intoxicating creation, so I

198
00:10:41,833 --> 00:10:41,993
say.

199
00:10:42,013 --> 00:10:44,774
Okay, we have three pillars here.

200
00:10:44,794 --> 00:10:48,735
I won't go through all of them because we actually only focused on one of them.

201
00:10:49,795 --> 00:10:51,075
So we thought we were going to do three.

202
00:10:51,095 --> 00:10:56,757
We ended up by doing one, and we thought that would be exploration and discovery, you know,

203
00:10:56,837 --> 00:10:59,638
parentheses the thrill of the unknown, the why.

204
00:11:01,408 --> 00:11:03,149
and we actually focused only on that.

205
00:11:03,729 --> 00:11:07,211
The other stuff came in in a secondary way,

206
00:11:08,112 --> 00:11:09,632
but I think that's actually one of the reasons

207
00:11:09,673 --> 00:11:10,393
why it works so well.

208
00:11:11,594 --> 00:11:14,135
So, starting with emotion, thrill of the unknown.

209
00:11:15,355 --> 00:11:18,496
The first thing we did was started with the music.

210
00:11:19,017 --> 00:11:20,317
And this is how I like to work.

211
00:11:20,857 --> 00:11:22,498
Just because it's about Subnautica,

212
00:11:22,518 --> 00:11:23,418
I thought I would show it to you.

213
00:11:23,898 --> 00:11:24,718
And it's about the emotion.

214
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:31,241
So the first prototype was just a menu with a song,

215
00:11:31,781 --> 00:11:32,441
which you can hear right now.

216
00:11:55,012 --> 00:11:59,696
So I don't know about you, but when I heard this, I mean I went through so many different

217
00:11:59,796 --> 00:12:04,560
artists and I tried to find something that was evoking the idea of the feelings we wanted

218
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:05,381
to create with this game.

219
00:12:06,181 --> 00:12:09,925
I mean I feel like I'm underwater already, it's just one track of music.

220
00:12:10,816 --> 00:12:19,478
This is Solar Fields and it is shamelessly stolen and never published anywhere so I think it's okay.

221
00:12:19,518 --> 00:12:24,839
You can even hear like a little like I don't know radio signals or something in the background.

222
00:12:25,359 --> 00:12:28,660
I don't know I've never really played this for anyone else so I don't really know if you guys

223
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:34,901
feel it but that's what I feel. So that was how we started with that emotion and whenever I needed

224
00:12:34,921 --> 00:12:40,082
to I could just go back to that and think you know to reconnect with what the point of this game is.

225
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:44,565
So after that musical exploration,

226
00:12:44,685 --> 00:12:47,367
starting with the emotion, we ended up

227
00:12:47,407 --> 00:12:50,749
by building our first prototype, real playable prototype.

228
00:12:51,309 --> 00:12:53,231
And I want to give a little background on something popular

229
00:12:53,331 --> 00:12:58,154
here in Silicon Valley called the Minimum Viable Product,

230
00:12:58,534 --> 00:12:59,274
the MVP.

231
00:13:01,115 --> 00:13:06,018
So if you're making a car, it's really hard to go make a car,

232
00:13:06,218 --> 00:13:08,140
because a lot of times you don't know that you're making a car.

233
00:13:09,052 --> 00:13:11,634
So you, instead of building a car,

234
00:13:11,854 --> 00:13:13,135
you start with a skateboard.

235
00:13:13,595 --> 00:13:15,197
Something that serves the same purpose,

236
00:13:15,277 --> 00:13:18,179
it's transportation and it will get you where you need to go,

237
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,321
but it doesn't have all the bells and whistles

238
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:22,282
or the technical complexity of building a car.

239
00:13:22,663 --> 00:13:25,165
And plus you don't really know you want a car yet,

240
00:13:25,305 --> 00:13:26,246
you just know you want something

241
00:13:26,266 --> 00:13:27,587
that gets you from point A to point B.

242
00:13:28,467 --> 00:13:29,489
So you release a skateboard.

243
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:32,333
You can see the unhappy face.

244
00:13:32,693 --> 00:13:34,155
Like users are like,

245
00:13:34,576 --> 00:13:36,759
it's just a skateboard and it's not that great.

246
00:13:37,860 --> 00:13:39,382
And so you go back and work some more

247
00:13:39,503 --> 00:13:40,584
and you add the handlebar on it.

248
00:13:41,405 --> 00:13:42,466
Now you have a skateboard like this.

249
00:13:42,486 --> 00:13:44,108
You get a little happier.

250
00:13:44,529 --> 00:13:47,011
Then you add a couple, you add the seat,

251
00:13:47,231 --> 00:13:48,132
and you add the pedals.

252
00:13:48,473 --> 00:13:49,954
And now you have a bicycle.

253
00:13:50,395 --> 00:13:52,197
People are starting to get a little happier.

254
00:13:52,217 --> 00:13:52,797
Then you go on.

255
00:13:52,817 --> 00:13:53,918
Suddenly, you have a motorcycle.

256
00:13:54,299 --> 00:13:55,180
Finally, you have the car.

257
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:59,824
So this idea of minimum viable product

258
00:14:00,325 --> 00:14:03,248
is that you can release that skateboard to your users

259
00:14:03,328 --> 00:14:03,708
right away.

260
00:14:04,569 --> 00:14:07,390
And it is functioning in the way that you want it to.

261
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,471
It is transport.

262
00:14:08,971 --> 00:14:11,492
It just doesn't happen to be the best version of it yet,

263
00:14:11,932 --> 00:14:12,812
but it is transport.

264
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:16,914
So I actually think making MVPs for original games

265
00:14:17,094 --> 00:14:20,135
is extremely difficult, which is why we don't do that.

266
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:25,136
We build, this is my term, the minimum crappy playable,

267
00:14:25,337 --> 00:14:26,537
the MCP.

268
00:14:28,138 --> 00:14:31,039
So it's not full featured.

269
00:14:31,499 --> 00:14:32,719
It's a piece of crap.

270
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:33,439
But.

271
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:38,144
If you don't start with making something crappy, you're just going to be frozen.

272
00:14:38,164 --> 00:14:39,786
Or at least, I'm always paralyzed.

273
00:14:40,307 --> 00:14:44,131
So, you know, it's a heady endeavor to create a game.

274
00:14:44,511 --> 00:14:47,234
But if you just create something crappy, just something crappy that's playable,

275
00:14:47,414 --> 00:14:48,816
okay, done.

276
00:14:49,656 --> 00:14:52,259
It gets you moving, it gives you permission to make something crappy

277
00:14:52,299 --> 00:14:53,921
and start, you know, the wheels start turning.

278
00:14:54,858 --> 00:15:01,107
And the amazing thing about making an MCP is that something that starts like this, which

279
00:15:01,167 --> 00:15:05,813
are the first, I would say, MCPs for Subnautica, eventually turn into something like this.

280
00:15:06,714 --> 00:15:08,156
Just like that skateboard and car.

281
00:15:08,677 --> 00:15:09,378
It's the same process.

282
00:15:12,543 --> 00:15:16,466
OK, so start with emotion, build an MCP.

283
00:15:18,028 --> 00:15:21,350
The next thing that we found really helpful for this game,

284
00:15:21,511 --> 00:15:23,612
we've never done this before, is this idea

285
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:27,255
of building minutes of fun into your game.

286
00:15:28,196 --> 00:15:30,899
So we started with five minutes of fun.

287
00:15:31,943 --> 00:15:33,043
That was that main menu.

288
00:15:33,664 --> 00:15:34,444
You just load it up.

289
00:15:34,924 --> 00:15:36,905
It's not really fun, but it's five minutes.

290
00:15:37,225 --> 00:15:38,066
Maybe you listen to the song,

291
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:39,946
and then it stops playing, and then you close it.

292
00:15:40,707 --> 00:15:43,368
The next prototype, I think we did, what was it?

293
00:15:43,548 --> 00:15:45,069
Five, okay, yeah.

294
00:15:45,929 --> 00:15:47,830
Listen to main music at the main menu.

295
00:15:47,890 --> 00:15:48,990
The next prototype, you say,

296
00:15:49,050 --> 00:15:50,691
okay, how do we make this last 20 minutes?

297
00:15:51,552 --> 00:15:52,693
Like, we have no idea.

298
00:15:53,053 --> 00:15:54,594
We just know we have a main menu, we have a song,

299
00:15:54,614 --> 00:15:55,295
we have the feelings.

300
00:15:56,015 --> 00:15:56,656
Where do we go next?

301
00:15:56,776 --> 00:15:58,598
Well, what we did is we said,

302
00:15:58,618 --> 00:16:01,841
okay, let's swim and explore one biome,

303
00:16:02,561 --> 00:16:03,202
collect some loot.

304
00:16:03,942 --> 00:16:05,203
You know, you can't do anything with it,

305
00:16:05,644 --> 00:16:06,725
but you can go collect some loot.

306
00:16:07,085 --> 00:16:09,347
Okay, that'll take players about 20 minutes to get through.

307
00:16:09,487 --> 00:16:11,809
And they'll kind of say, yeah, it's all right.

308
00:16:13,230 --> 00:16:14,391
Then you go to 40 minutes.

309
00:16:14,512 --> 00:16:15,272
Okay, what do you do now?

310
00:16:15,753 --> 00:16:19,075
Well, maybe you, maybe the game starts on top of a raft.

311
00:16:19,976 --> 00:16:22,441
and it has a fabricator on there, it's really ugly.

312
00:16:23,202 --> 00:16:25,846
But you can swim, you can collect loot,

313
00:16:25,906 --> 00:16:27,569
you can craft your first knife,

314
00:16:27,950 --> 00:16:29,712
and then you can use that to harvest kelp.

315
00:16:30,113 --> 00:16:32,637
Okay, that's about 40 minutes worth, and so on and so forth.

316
00:16:33,632 --> 00:16:34,472
Then you get to one hour.

317
00:16:35,172 --> 00:16:38,354
And the cool thing is, when we did this process at least,

318
00:16:38,394 --> 00:16:39,554
I think it's replicable,

319
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:45,116
it gets exponentially expansive.

320
00:16:45,557 --> 00:16:47,477
Like the amount of time that you get with each prototype,

321
00:16:47,497 --> 00:16:49,358
the amount of gameplay time, goes up and up and up.

322
00:16:49,658 --> 00:16:51,519
Because all the systems start to work with each other.

323
00:16:51,979 --> 00:16:53,380
And of course, you know the game now.

324
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:55,020
You know more and more about it.

325
00:16:55,541 --> 00:16:58,042
So one prototype gets you 20 minutes,

326
00:16:58,062 --> 00:17:01,923
the next one might get you another hour worth of gameplay.

327
00:17:02,827 --> 00:17:05,029
So now maybe you see some creatures swimming around,

328
00:17:05,049 --> 00:17:07,550
you harvest this, we have no alien creatures,

329
00:17:07,590 --> 00:17:11,173
we had narwhals, they were just like copied from,

330
00:17:11,193 --> 00:17:13,034
I don't know where, from the asset store or something,

331
00:17:13,054 --> 00:17:15,155
I can't remember where we got them, just earth creatures.

332
00:17:16,156 --> 00:17:19,318
And now you have a submarine and you go on and on and so forth.

333
00:17:20,038 --> 00:17:24,661
And we use this technique to go all the way to what,

334
00:17:24,761 --> 00:17:26,662
I don't know what we have now, 30 hours of gameplay,

335
00:17:26,782 --> 00:17:27,243
40, 50, 60 for some people.

336
00:17:32,082 --> 00:17:32,462
Okay.

337
00:17:34,944 --> 00:17:36,504
So early on in those prototypes,

338
00:17:36,745 --> 00:17:40,987
we didn't know what the goal of the game would be.

339
00:17:42,207 --> 00:17:44,388
And it was way too much work to try to figure out

340
00:17:44,929 --> 00:17:45,949
what that goal could be,

341
00:17:46,169 --> 00:17:48,410
because we knew we wanted a sandbox experience,

342
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:49,951
or somewhat sandboxy,

343
00:17:50,952 --> 00:17:53,733
and we had no idea about story yet,

344
00:17:54,193 --> 00:17:55,394
but we needed to get players going.

345
00:17:56,214 --> 00:17:56,374
So...

346
00:17:57,495 --> 00:18:03,482
Someone had the idea, well, maybe just put in some treasure chests and players, if they

347
00:18:03,522 --> 00:18:05,985
collect five, then they win the game.

348
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:11,292
And well, we don't really have time to program that in, so they'll just notice if they have

349
00:18:11,312 --> 00:18:12,553
five and then they can quit playing.

350
00:18:14,176 --> 00:18:16,257
Which is really weird, and it sounds really stupid,

351
00:18:16,417 --> 00:18:18,818
but this actually freed us up completely

352
00:18:18,838 --> 00:18:20,818
to just focus on the low-level stuff.

353
00:18:21,239 --> 00:18:24,920
Swimming, crafting, oxygen, the environments, creatures.

354
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:26,500
We didn't have to think about the high level.

355
00:18:27,181 --> 00:18:30,502
So, you know, you hear a lot about placeholder models,

356
00:18:30,822 --> 00:18:33,163
and I think we can start placeholder,

357
00:18:33,303 --> 00:18:34,523
using placeholders for other things,

358
00:18:34,803 --> 00:18:36,504
like goals, try it, house rule.

359
00:18:39,228 --> 00:18:41,350
So this is recent footage.

360
00:18:41,370 --> 00:18:43,713
I don't have the old footage here, unfortunately.

361
00:18:43,813 --> 00:18:48,939
But in our early prototypes, we had a bug in our oxygen meter.

362
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,142
So you're diving underwater.

363
00:18:51,162 --> 00:18:53,164
You have, say, 30 seconds of oxygen.

364
00:18:53,184 --> 00:18:56,047
And when you start to run out, the HUD

365
00:18:56,508 --> 00:18:58,791
starts to go black as you lose consciousness.

366
00:18:59,011 --> 00:18:59,611
It's very dramatic.

367
00:19:00,512 --> 00:19:03,534
And as you get to the surface, well, I'll show you.

368
00:19:03,554 --> 00:19:05,455
I'm going to show you what happens here.

369
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:09,738
It takes, there's a pause where your screen is totally black

370
00:19:10,378 --> 00:19:13,840
and you're not dead and you seem like you're not alive,

371
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,722
but then you get to the surface and then you come back to life.

372
00:19:16,742 --> 00:19:19,063
So I'm going to show you that real quickly.

373
00:19:19,083 --> 00:19:23,265
Oxygen.

374
00:19:29,532 --> 00:19:30,314
So swimming, swimming.

375
00:19:30,334 --> 00:19:33,159
The HUD is just starting to darken.

376
00:19:33,179 --> 00:19:34,962
Out of oxygen now.

377
00:19:34,982 --> 00:19:38,769
Okay, not at the surface, not at the surface,

378
00:19:38,829 --> 00:19:39,490
not at the surface.

379
00:19:39,690 --> 00:19:40,231
Should be dead.

380
00:19:40,832 --> 00:19:41,213
Surprise.

381
00:19:42,294 --> 00:19:46,598
Okay, so this was a bug that we decided we had to keep in there forever.

382
00:19:46,618 --> 00:19:50,481
And in fact, we never even decided it because no one ever complained.

383
00:19:51,442 --> 00:19:53,364
People loved it. It was the weirdest thing.

384
00:19:54,565 --> 00:19:56,526
We didn't even discuss fixing this.

385
00:19:56,566 --> 00:19:57,227
I don't even know if...

386
00:19:57,967 --> 00:19:59,929
It's like maybe this is the first time we've ever even mentioned it.

387
00:20:01,430 --> 00:20:02,711
And the reason why that was so great,

388
00:20:03,251 --> 00:20:05,113
I mean, maybe it doesn't look that great in this one clip,

389
00:20:05,153 --> 00:20:06,754
but if you watch a YouTuber experience that,

390
00:20:06,854 --> 00:20:09,055
and they're like Fiero at the top,

391
00:20:09,095 --> 00:20:11,237
they're just jubilant that they made it

392
00:20:11,337 --> 00:20:11,957
with all their loot,

393
00:20:12,958 --> 00:20:16,500
it fit really well into our emotional idea of the game,

394
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:17,941
this thrill of the unknown.

395
00:20:18,001 --> 00:20:20,643
And that one is less on the thrill of the unknown

396
00:20:20,683 --> 00:20:22,184
and more on just positive emotion.

397
00:20:22,484 --> 00:20:24,125
People were so happy to have that

398
00:20:24,485 --> 00:20:27,447
that we, again, by being emotionally driven, we kept it.

399
00:20:27,668 --> 00:20:28,868
There wasn't even a discussion.

400
00:20:30,988 --> 00:20:34,429
So early on, we also had some ideas,

401
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,830
or we had a problem where we knew

402
00:20:36,950 --> 00:20:39,130
that our world could not be infinite.

403
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:41,731
We wanted it to feel infinite,

404
00:20:42,091 --> 00:20:45,012
but we obviously had a boundary.

405
00:20:45,952 --> 00:20:47,373
And so we were trying to figure out

406
00:20:47,413 --> 00:20:48,653
what to do at the world edge.

407
00:20:49,253 --> 00:20:49,833
So right there.

408
00:20:51,935 --> 00:20:54,457
One of the ideas we had, we floated around,

409
00:20:54,517 --> 00:20:56,839
was making cliffs at the world edge.

410
00:20:57,239 --> 00:20:58,700
Of course, we could do invisible walls.

411
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:01,202
None of those things really made a lot of sense to us.

412
00:21:02,523 --> 00:21:05,005
Someone, it might have been Jonas, actually,

413
00:21:06,106 --> 00:21:09,369
had the idea to drop the world down into an abyss,

414
00:21:09,789 --> 00:21:14,013
like negative infinity depth, which is what we did.

415
00:21:15,014 --> 00:21:15,134
And

416
00:21:16,534 --> 00:21:19,336
What was so cool about that is that it actually

417
00:21:19,476 --> 00:21:21,878
helped our theme, something that was a limitation,

418
00:21:22,399 --> 00:21:23,940
the fact that we don't have an infinite world,

419
00:21:24,081 --> 00:21:25,342
yet we want it to feel infinite.

420
00:21:25,942 --> 00:21:29,486
By dropping that height map down to negative infinity,

421
00:21:30,226 --> 00:21:31,948
it actually gave players the feeling

422
00:21:31,988 --> 00:21:33,910
that the world actually was infinite.

423
00:21:34,770 --> 00:21:36,712
And players go out there all the time

424
00:21:36,772 --> 00:21:38,774
and they encounter these kind of crazy creatures too.

425
00:21:38,954 --> 00:21:40,476
We put those in there to make sure

426
00:21:40,496 --> 00:21:41,557
you don't swim down too far.

427
00:21:42,636 --> 00:21:43,836
So that was an example of something,

428
00:21:43,856 --> 00:21:46,077
a limitation that we actually turned into,

429
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:47,657
essentially a strength of the game.

430
00:21:50,178 --> 00:21:53,579
We also put in this HUD, this is just a scuba mask,

431
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,099
and you'll see a recurring theme in this talk

432
00:21:57,340 --> 00:22:00,040
is stuff that we tried that we didn't realize was great

433
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,701
that actually turned out to be great,

434
00:22:02,181 --> 00:22:03,881
but it's us noticing that it was great.

435
00:22:04,801 --> 00:22:07,262
So the scuba HUD, you know, you're underwater,

436
00:22:07,282 --> 00:22:07,942
you're a scuba diver.

437
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:09,990
You have a scuba mask.

438
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,332
And one really cool thing about that

439
00:22:12,392 --> 00:22:15,314
is it actually makes you feel more claustrophobic,

440
00:22:15,774 --> 00:22:18,476
which tied really well into the feelings

441
00:22:18,556 --> 00:22:19,777
that we wanted to get out of the game.

442
00:22:23,032 --> 00:22:25,934
And then we put this guy in, this huge reef back.

443
00:22:26,975 --> 00:22:28,996
And the funny thing about this reef back

444
00:22:29,056 --> 00:22:30,877
is I always thought he was really lame.

445
00:22:31,857 --> 00:22:33,818
And he doesn't do anything.

446
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:36,300
He's just this huge sea cow.

447
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,602
He just makes some noise, and he floats around.

448
00:22:39,622 --> 00:22:42,443
You barely even can see that he's moving.

449
00:22:43,203 --> 00:22:46,105
But we put him in, and I want you to see a clip here of,

450
00:22:47,305 --> 00:22:50,246
this is EatMyDiction1, and he was one of the first

451
00:22:50,646 --> 00:22:52,787
kind of medium tier streamers that covered our game.

452
00:22:53,668 --> 00:22:55,448
And watch his face when he sees this thing.

453
00:22:56,969 --> 00:22:57,449
Oh, it's scary.

454
00:22:57,469 --> 00:22:59,050
Can you stop being a broken bitch?

455
00:22:59,130 --> 00:22:59,690
Oh my God!

456
00:23:02,271 --> 00:23:03,291
I found Cthulhu!

457
00:23:03,912 --> 00:23:04,992
I found Cthulhu!

458
00:23:09,194 --> 00:23:10,254
I found Cthulhu!

459
00:23:10,274 --> 00:23:12,675
If Halo 5 isn't downloaded, I'm gonna be so mad.

460
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:16,411
Okay, it looks like Halo 5 is downloaded.

461
00:23:17,712 --> 00:23:18,413
Um, okay.

462
00:23:19,193 --> 00:23:21,755
Okay, he's not depressed anymore, or broken anymore.

463
00:23:21,795 --> 00:23:23,056
We have the perfect amount, right?

464
00:23:23,096 --> 00:23:24,517
Oh yes, they don't move right now.

465
00:23:24,577 --> 00:23:26,079
Yeah, yeah.

466
00:23:26,099 --> 00:23:27,780
Wonderful.

467
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:29,121
Just wonderful.

468
00:23:30,202 --> 00:23:30,962
Let me, let me, uh...

469
00:23:31,022 --> 00:23:31,383
Right there.

470
00:23:31,403 --> 00:23:32,784
I'll have to sign in again.

471
00:23:32,824 --> 00:23:34,285
Sign me in.

472
00:23:35,266 --> 00:23:36,947
Okay, I have, I have Halo 5.

473
00:23:36,987 --> 00:23:37,327
We are good.

474
00:23:38,523 --> 00:23:43,407
And when we saw that, we knew that we had to add more big creatures in the game.

475
00:23:44,028 --> 00:23:45,109
It's a huge amount of work.

476
00:23:45,189 --> 00:23:46,831
I was fighting it the whole way.

477
00:23:47,591 --> 00:23:49,573
But it's hard to relent.

478
00:23:49,773 --> 00:23:52,156
You had to relent when you see reactions like that.

479
00:23:52,476 --> 00:23:53,557
So we added this crab squid.

480
00:23:53,657 --> 00:23:54,258
Huge amount of work.

481
00:23:54,878 --> 00:23:56,139
We added this sea dragon.

482
00:23:56,159 --> 00:23:58,962
I don't even want to think about what was required for that.

483
00:24:00,997 --> 00:24:03,619
And then of course this guy, the Reaper Leviathan,

484
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:06,562
who's probably responsible for half of our YouTube views

485
00:24:07,263 --> 00:24:08,604
and maybe corresponding sales

486
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:10,286
and definitely all the jump scare videos.

487
00:24:13,068 --> 00:24:14,770
So we also put in some small creatures,

488
00:24:15,070 --> 00:24:16,972
but the cute fish, or cuttlefish.

489
00:24:18,033 --> 00:24:21,396
So we discovered that big creatures work well in this game

490
00:24:22,938 --> 00:24:23,498
and we embraced it.

491
00:24:25,466 --> 00:24:30,469
So, more on the map, and making an open world game,

492
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:34,811
we knew that we didn't want to limit players,

493
00:24:35,732 --> 00:24:37,073
and we didn't want to tell them where to go,

494
00:24:38,313 --> 00:24:42,135
but we did want them to kind of be drawn downward,

495
00:24:42,716 --> 00:24:44,757
because down is how you advance the game.

496
00:24:45,637 --> 00:24:48,759
Down is where all the mysteries lie in Subnautica,

497
00:24:48,819 --> 00:24:49,800
but we never want to tell you that,

498
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:51,441
we want you to discover that and go there on your own.

499
00:24:52,186 --> 00:24:57,012
So the first thing we did is we made the world infinite.

500
00:24:57,232 --> 00:25:01,518
I mean, the map terrain is not infinite,

501
00:25:01,578 --> 00:25:03,481
but technically you can swim as far as you want.

502
00:25:03,661 --> 00:25:04,823
It just turns into nothingness.

503
00:25:05,343 --> 00:25:07,747
So we kept that in there and players just,

504
00:25:07,767 --> 00:25:09,189
they turn around and they come home

505
00:25:09,209 --> 00:25:09,910
because it's really boring.

506
00:25:12,215 --> 00:25:19,258
And then here is you can see the same map with the height data and you can see if you know what the Aurora looks like.

507
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:23,580
It's around four o'clock, it's that big kind of oval shape, the crashed spaceship.

508
00:25:26,021 --> 00:25:30,803
So when the game starts we choose a random start location and that's that green area in the middle.

509
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,324
And the cool thing about this random start is that...

510
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:38,449
people actually thought that our world was procedurally generated.

511
00:25:38,930 --> 00:25:41,693
Many players thought that, which was a huge win for us

512
00:25:41,773 --> 00:25:43,555
because they felt like they could replay the game,

513
00:25:43,595 --> 00:25:45,377
and they probably could replay it a little bit,

514
00:25:45,478 --> 00:25:46,759
like, you know, maybe a couple times.

515
00:25:48,942 --> 00:25:50,404
But it added to that feeling of mystery.

516
00:25:51,569 --> 00:25:54,471
So let's see, they start there randomly,

517
00:25:54,691 --> 00:25:57,353
and you can see that's the side view of the height map,

518
00:25:57,674 --> 00:25:59,495
and the green is where they spawn.

519
00:26:00,156 --> 00:26:01,717
And what we ended up by doing is putting,

520
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:04,599
just basically making the map almost like a pyramid.

521
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:06,321
So you start at the top,

522
00:26:06,461 --> 00:26:08,082
and of course you have the water up here.

523
00:26:08,743 --> 00:26:11,725
And as you swim out, as you explore in any direction,

524
00:26:11,785 --> 00:26:14,187
you're just gonna naturally follow the line down.

525
00:26:15,028 --> 00:26:18,973
So this meant that, and we tried other approaches too,

526
00:26:19,033 --> 00:26:21,575
but this one ended up by having players

527
00:26:21,856 --> 00:26:23,898
just go where we wanted them to,

528
00:26:24,058 --> 00:26:25,880
basically go to the interesting stuff

529
00:26:25,981 --> 00:26:27,102
and follow the world down.

530
00:26:30,484 --> 00:26:32,306
And then of course we did put all this other,

531
00:26:32,326 --> 00:26:33,988
the ghost leviathans out there too,

532
00:26:34,028 --> 00:26:34,889
which I already mentioned.

533
00:26:35,690 --> 00:26:37,492
Okay.

534
00:26:37,512 --> 00:26:42,138
So, another huge kind of reframe for us in this game

535
00:26:42,839 --> 00:26:46,062
was this idea of never telling the player what to do

536
00:26:46,703 --> 00:26:48,065
and respecting the player's time.

537
00:26:48,805 --> 00:26:52,270
And this ties into the idea of an intrinsic reward,

538
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,573
you know, intrinsic over extrinsic rewards.

539
00:26:55,574 --> 00:26:59,239
So Jamie Chang and Chris Hecker both wrote excellent articles

540
00:26:59,319 --> 00:27:01,802
on this subject, and they really inspired us

541
00:27:01,883 --> 00:27:04,246
and got us to the next level with our game.

542
00:27:05,147 --> 00:27:11,490
So an extrinsic reward is something you probably are familiar with, like gamer rank, achievements,

543
00:27:11,710 --> 00:27:17,474
leveling up, you know, gold. It's like, you know, tangible specific rewards that are given to you

544
00:27:17,514 --> 00:27:18,555
when you do the right thing.

545
00:27:19,717 --> 00:27:24,019
An intrinsic reward is like maybe a positive emotion,

546
00:27:24,039 --> 00:27:27,140
or maybe like you feel good when you play the game,

547
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:29,501
or you enjoy spending time with your friends,

548
00:27:29,601 --> 00:27:30,741
so that's why you play the game.

549
00:27:31,802 --> 00:27:33,703
If you're motivated by an intrinsic reward,

550
00:27:34,283 --> 00:27:36,484
I like to think that you're having

551
00:27:36,524 --> 00:27:38,524
a more meaningful interaction with the game.

552
00:27:39,725 --> 00:27:42,786
And I was really hoping that we could fully embrace

553
00:27:44,107 --> 00:27:45,347
100% intrinsic rewards in this game.

554
00:27:46,413 --> 00:27:51,676
It's a little scary because, you know, we've all been taught as designers that extrinsic

555
00:27:51,716 --> 00:27:54,498
rewards drive player behavior and motivation.

556
00:27:55,098 --> 00:27:58,800
And there have been a lot of studies on this, and they do drive it in the short term.

557
00:27:58,820 --> 00:28:00,981
I mean, you should definitely read these papers.

558
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:03,243
It's all in the appendix if you want to dive deeper on this.

559
00:28:03,303 --> 00:28:04,263
I won't summarize it here.

560
00:28:05,124 --> 00:28:07,765
but it does drive player motivation in the short term

561
00:28:08,125 --> 00:28:09,986
and it drops it in the long term.

562
00:28:10,426 --> 00:28:12,667
That's the summary, it's not fully accurate,

563
00:28:12,707 --> 00:28:14,748
but let's just say it's largely accurate.

564
00:28:15,448 --> 00:28:17,069
So we wanted players to play the game

565
00:28:17,109 --> 00:28:18,130
because they love the game,

566
00:28:18,150 --> 00:28:21,151
and we were willing to take a risk

567
00:28:21,551 --> 00:28:23,312
and not handhold them

568
00:28:23,472 --> 00:28:25,573
and not give them quests along the way.

569
00:28:26,214 --> 00:28:27,074
We didn't want them to feel like

570
00:28:27,094 --> 00:28:28,375
they were tricked into playing the game.

571
00:28:31,375 --> 00:28:37,420
So one of those, one of the ideas there was we had to start thinking about, like, instead

572
00:28:37,460 --> 00:28:43,546
of tutorials or helping players learn the game, we had to flip that idea on its head

573
00:28:43,706 --> 00:28:47,430
and realize that when players discover the game, that's actually the fun part.

574
00:28:48,567 --> 00:28:53,213
So, you know, coming back to this pillar emotion,

575
00:28:54,394 --> 00:28:56,917
you know, the thrill of the unknown,

576
00:28:56,937 --> 00:29:00,321
it just goes away once it becomes known, right?

577
00:29:00,381 --> 00:29:02,263
Like, it's like the horror,

578
00:29:02,403 --> 00:29:04,145
like the monster in a horror movie.

579
00:29:04,466 --> 00:29:06,228
As soon as you see it, the thrill goes away.

580
00:29:07,089 --> 00:29:09,310
So we definitely didn't want to just tell people things.

581
00:29:10,490 --> 00:29:12,091
It was okay if they discovered it on their own,

582
00:29:12,591 --> 00:29:14,412
but we were never going to just explain it to them.

583
00:29:15,152 --> 00:29:17,553
So this is the idea of this mantra that we had,

584
00:29:17,573 --> 00:29:20,155
at least I would basically yell at other people

585
00:29:20,195 --> 00:29:21,575
and tell them, never tell the player what to do.

586
00:29:21,835 --> 00:29:22,676
You're telling the player what to do.

587
00:29:24,817 --> 00:29:27,978
And this idea of not feeling bad

588
00:29:28,118 --> 00:29:29,459
if players have to go to the wiki.

589
00:29:30,179 --> 00:29:32,521
And that was something that kind of crippled us early on.

590
00:29:32,561 --> 00:29:34,541
We're like, oh, but what if players have to go to the wiki

591
00:29:34,601 --> 00:29:35,802
because we didn't explain something.

592
00:29:36,705 --> 00:29:39,428
Well, Minecraft did it and it was amazing.

593
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:43,392
So we realized that that learning is by far,

594
00:29:43,792 --> 00:29:45,414
like that learning is actually the fun part.

595
00:29:45,874 --> 00:29:47,235
So as long as players are learning,

596
00:29:47,496 --> 00:29:49,958
I mean it's still not great if they have to go to the wiki,

597
00:29:50,038 --> 00:29:51,379
you'd rather have them learn in game.

598
00:29:51,860 --> 00:29:53,281
But as long as they're the ones learning

599
00:29:53,481 --> 00:29:54,583
and we're not just telling them,

600
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,705
that's by far more important.

601
00:29:58,878 --> 00:30:02,621
And a corollary is that the more frustration

602
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:05,383
players would have, the more exhilarated they would be

603
00:30:05,423 --> 00:30:06,984
when they finally overcame the obstacle.

604
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,367
So we had to change how we thought about frustration.

605
00:30:10,567 --> 00:30:11,888
It wasn't just necessarily bad

606
00:30:11,928 --> 00:30:13,109
as soon as players were frustrated.

607
00:30:13,129 --> 00:30:14,670
It's like, well, actually, this could be good

608
00:30:14,911 --> 00:30:16,051
as long as they don't stop playing.

609
00:30:16,071 --> 00:30:18,673
If they stop playing, then you know it's bad.

610
00:30:19,034 --> 00:30:22,096
We actually put some telemetrics in there

611
00:30:22,176 --> 00:30:25,579
to get a better example of that, to know more about that.

612
00:30:28,238 --> 00:30:30,119
Okay, let's see here.

613
00:30:30,639 --> 00:30:32,700
Checking my time.

614
00:30:35,201 --> 00:30:37,642
Another technique we used a couple times in the game

615
00:30:37,662 --> 00:30:39,103
and I would like to continue to use more

616
00:30:39,383 --> 00:30:45,025
is this concept of training wheels.

617
00:30:45,805 --> 00:30:47,526
When we first released into early access,

618
00:30:47,906 --> 00:30:49,867
we didn't have any survival mechanics.

619
00:30:50,267 --> 00:30:53,008
We had no hunger, no eating or drinking.

620
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:54,824
and our players were like,

621
00:30:54,844 --> 00:30:56,406
ah, how can you make a survival game

622
00:30:56,446 --> 00:30:58,750
without, you know, hunger and thirst?

623
00:30:59,051 --> 00:31:00,713
And we didn't even know we were making a survival game,

624
00:31:00,773 --> 00:31:02,336
but someone tagged it on Steam,

625
00:31:02,556 --> 00:31:03,478
so they said it was a survival game.

626
00:31:04,310 --> 00:31:07,613
So they convinced us to put the hunger and thirst in.

627
00:31:08,574 --> 00:31:10,916
And the really cool thing about it, something, again,

628
00:31:10,936 --> 00:31:13,378
this talk is all about how we just stumbled

629
00:31:13,478 --> 00:31:16,581
on the good stuff, but it's noticing the good stuff.

630
00:31:18,443 --> 00:31:22,026
We noticed that players, early on in the game,

631
00:31:22,166 --> 00:31:23,848
because we had no direct goals,

632
00:31:24,749 --> 00:31:28,772
they understood that they needed to eat and drink immediately,

633
00:31:28,972 --> 00:31:30,153
because if they didn't, they would die.

634
00:31:30,754 --> 00:31:33,716
So early on in the game, they would go out, find fish,

635
00:31:34,196 --> 00:31:35,918
get water, come back, cook it, eat it.

636
00:31:35,938 --> 00:31:37,980
And then they have some time where

637
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:39,541
they can just kind of explore interfaces

638
00:31:39,581 --> 00:31:40,802
or just kind of go out on their own.

639
00:31:41,202 --> 00:31:44,125
Then a little indicator pops up again and says, oh, you're

640
00:31:44,165 --> 00:31:44,765
running out of food.

641
00:31:45,206 --> 00:31:45,686
They go back.

642
00:31:46,507 --> 00:31:50,390
Over time, as they learned how to master their calories

643
00:31:50,530 --> 00:31:53,132
and water, like most survival games,

644
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,673
it gets easier and easier.

645
00:31:55,594 --> 00:32:00,157
So it kind of like falls away.

646
00:32:00,777 --> 00:32:02,399
You don't have to think about it anymore.

647
00:32:02,479 --> 00:32:03,219
You start farming.

648
00:32:03,660 --> 00:32:06,041
You have machinery that's cranking out water for you.

649
00:32:06,462 --> 00:32:08,623
So this whole kind of like motivation

650
00:32:08,703 --> 00:32:10,305
of telling you what to do early on,

651
00:32:10,765 --> 00:32:13,447
it just kind of slipped away like training wheels.

652
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:16,501
which to me was the perfect solution

653
00:32:16,641 --> 00:32:18,342
because we wanted players to come up with their own goals.

654
00:32:19,443 --> 00:32:20,963
But we didn't want them to feel aimless in the beginning.

655
00:32:22,204 --> 00:32:23,985
Another way we use this concept of training wheels

656
00:32:24,625 --> 00:32:25,845
is through our crafting menu.

657
00:32:26,846 --> 00:32:28,487
So in the beginning,

658
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:32,468
like, you know, we were heavily inspired by Don't Starve,

659
00:32:32,829 --> 00:32:33,429
their crafting.

660
00:32:34,489 --> 00:32:35,690
We have a similar crafting menu.

661
00:32:37,110 --> 00:32:38,931
But in the beginning, we only give you a few options.

662
00:32:39,351 --> 00:32:41,592
I mean, I can't remember how many are there at the start,

663
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:43,153
but there's only a few relevant ones.

664
00:32:44,114 --> 00:32:47,355
And over time, we add many, many more options

665
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:49,276
and even entire new menus.

666
00:32:49,776 --> 00:32:51,376
So you have the fabricator menu to start.

667
00:32:51,617 --> 00:32:52,657
That expands and expands.

668
00:32:52,697 --> 00:32:54,358
And then we added like five other menus

669
00:32:54,398 --> 00:32:55,198
over the course of the game.

670
00:32:55,798 --> 00:32:58,099
But in the beginning, the stuff that we really want you to do

671
00:32:58,119 --> 00:32:59,240
is get loot.

672
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:03,922
And if you craft one of the only options there,

673
00:33:04,062 --> 00:33:06,944
which is like the O2 tank or the fins,

674
00:33:07,745 --> 00:33:11,287
then that kind of promotes a get loot style of game,

675
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,187
you know, of gameplay.

676
00:33:13,188 --> 00:33:15,189
Or, you know, we wanted you to fix that radio,

677
00:33:15,249 --> 00:33:17,311
which was there in your escape pod.

678
00:33:17,851 --> 00:33:19,592
That kind of kicks off one of the storylines.

679
00:33:20,273 --> 00:33:22,954
So instead of telling you, like, go fix the radio,

680
00:33:23,094 --> 00:33:25,836
we just put as one of the only options, a little repair tool.

681
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,377
And guess what, there's only one thing you can repair

682
00:33:27,497 --> 00:33:28,878
that you can know about when you start the game,

683
00:33:28,898 --> 00:33:29,518
and that's the radio.

684
00:33:31,483 --> 00:33:33,291
And then we have pipes and air pumps,

685
00:33:33,893 --> 00:33:36,324
and those kind of encourage you to build a mini-base.

686
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,031
So those are kind of more of our directed goals.

687
00:33:40,431 --> 00:33:42,352
These are things that we wanted the player to do.

688
00:33:42,452 --> 00:33:43,952
We knew it was good for the early game.

689
00:33:43,992 --> 00:33:46,533
It helped players get comfortable, get on their feet.

690
00:33:49,114 --> 00:33:52,636
But we didn't want to control them the whole game.

691
00:33:52,656 --> 00:33:54,236
We wanted them to start coming up with their own goals.

692
00:33:54,776 --> 00:33:57,017
So over time, we added many more options.

693
00:33:57,617 --> 00:34:00,419
And what's happening is the menu is getting more,

694
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:01,379
because it's getting bigger,

695
00:34:02,160 --> 00:34:08,588
Like the and it's being populated by player choices essentially by scanning fact fragments and things

696
00:34:09,870 --> 00:34:15,437
We have less and less control over that. So as this expands these other goals, they tend to be more player driven

697
00:34:16,553 --> 00:34:19,294
So we have a high capacity O2 tank that lets you go deeper.

698
00:34:19,314 --> 00:34:20,515
We have a radiation suit.

699
00:34:21,095 --> 00:34:22,596
Oh, you see the radiation suit.

700
00:34:22,656 --> 00:34:25,117
Maybe I'll go, maybe I can get through that radiation now

701
00:34:25,177 --> 00:34:25,837
next to the Aurora.

702
00:34:25,857 --> 00:34:27,418
Ah, maybe I can board the Aurora.

703
00:34:27,778 --> 00:34:31,219
But the players feel like they created that goal themselves.

704
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,961
And they more or less did, but we influenced it.

705
00:34:35,801 --> 00:34:36,902
Then we have a pathfinder tool.

706
00:34:37,222 --> 00:34:38,543
Oh, maybe I should explore some caves.

707
00:34:40,256 --> 00:34:42,957
air bladder, maybe I can explore some deep open areas

708
00:34:43,057 --> 00:34:44,858
because the thing lets you come back up really fast,

709
00:34:44,958 --> 00:34:47,179
so you can go straight down, use all your oxygen,

710
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,260
then pop straight back up.

711
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:51,781
Or the laser cutter, maybe I can go explore wrecks.

712
00:34:52,582 --> 00:34:57,124
So this is a way that we can kind of guide players,

713
00:34:57,424 --> 00:35:00,765
but kind of do it invisibly and have that control,

714
00:35:01,126 --> 00:35:03,307
that guide kind of go away over time.

715
00:35:07,347 --> 00:35:13,653
Okay, a lot of people have talked about the story in Subnautica and how it's structured

716
00:35:13,733 --> 00:35:16,675
and how they had a different experience than someone else.

717
00:35:17,156 --> 00:35:23,442
That makes us super happy and I would say that we pretty much organically fell into

718
00:35:23,482 --> 00:35:24,002
this approach.

719
00:35:24,883 --> 00:35:28,687
And the way we did it was most games would have a linear story or no story.

720
00:35:29,667 --> 00:35:32,789
And what we did is we had multi, multi-linear stories,

721
00:35:33,169 --> 00:35:34,690
like seven different stories.

722
00:35:35,130 --> 00:35:38,071
So the first one, this is the Aurora storyline.

723
00:35:38,552 --> 00:35:40,733
So the explorer find the exosuit, the prawn,

724
00:35:40,873 --> 00:35:41,793
and find blue tablet.

725
00:35:42,594 --> 00:35:44,515
That one kicks off at a random time.

726
00:35:45,315 --> 00:35:47,376
So this is, you know, left to right is time,

727
00:35:48,036 --> 00:35:49,997
and the gray box is what the thing

728
00:35:50,037 --> 00:35:52,218
that triggers the beginning of the storyline.

729
00:35:53,297 --> 00:35:55,579
So then we have another one, Sunbeam Story.

730
00:35:56,019 --> 00:35:58,040
When you repair the radio, that one kicks off.

731
00:35:58,580 --> 00:36:01,242
So whenever possible, we had storylines

732
00:36:01,602 --> 00:36:03,083
kick off by player action.

733
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:05,304
Sometimes we have random timers,

734
00:36:05,404 --> 00:36:06,945
but either way there's variance there,

735
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:08,166
and that's what's the most important.

736
00:36:09,447 --> 00:36:11,968
We have the Degasi Story, or Visit the Floating Island,

737
00:36:12,008 --> 00:36:13,609
I think that one, that's what it was.

738
00:36:14,090 --> 00:36:16,231
Escape pods, when you find the first escape pod.

739
00:36:17,476 --> 00:36:19,796
the infection story, the precursor story,

740
00:36:20,817 --> 00:36:21,657
and the emperor story.

741
00:36:22,237 --> 00:36:23,697
So the thing that's really cool about this

742
00:36:23,777 --> 00:36:26,158
and the reason why it's different,

743
00:36:26,578 --> 00:36:28,178
but you know, different players have a different experience,

744
00:36:28,678 --> 00:36:31,499
even though, you know, it's all just basically

745
00:36:31,519 --> 00:36:34,859
a bunch of linear stories, is because their experience,

746
00:36:34,979 --> 00:36:35,980
let's see, is that showing there?

747
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:37,360
Yep, okay.

748
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:40,821
That vertical line is their experience of the story

749
00:36:40,941 --> 00:36:42,041
at any given moment, right?

750
00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:43,321
As they go left to right.

751
00:36:43,661 --> 00:36:44,961
But all those events,

752
00:36:45,702 --> 00:36:47,543
These are all kicked off at different times,

753
00:36:48,044 --> 00:36:50,806
so the slice that you're experiencing

754
00:36:50,946 --> 00:36:52,027
is different for different players.

755
00:36:53,268 --> 00:36:57,332
So if you want to do kind of open-ended story,

756
00:36:57,532 --> 00:36:58,633
this might be an approach.

757
00:37:00,963 --> 00:37:04,326
Okay, another way we subconsciously guided the player

758
00:37:05,287 --> 00:37:07,389
is the first time you exit your escape pod.

759
00:37:07,409 --> 00:37:09,531
You know, we wanted you to get to that Aurora.

760
00:37:10,291 --> 00:37:12,573
So I didn't even know this was in there

761
00:37:12,613 --> 00:37:15,376
until I was researching this talk, which is interesting.

762
00:37:15,396 --> 00:37:17,037
There's so many little details in this game

763
00:37:17,077 --> 00:37:19,960
that were just contributed by everyone on the team,

764
00:37:20,160 --> 00:37:21,301
which just thrills me.

765
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:24,924
But this is what happens the first time you exit the Aurora,

766
00:37:25,265 --> 00:37:26,586
or your escape pod, rather.

767
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:40,146
So we have that audio stinger, it's like,

768
00:37:40,306 --> 00:37:42,548
this is important, you know, dramatic,

769
00:37:42,888 --> 00:37:44,069
and you look right at the aurora.

770
00:37:44,109 --> 00:37:44,989
Did you put that in, Brian?

771
00:37:45,649 --> 00:37:47,010
No, okay, I don't know who put that in.

772
00:37:47,611 --> 00:37:49,832
So, and the way that we did that,

773
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:51,273
even though we have the random start

774
00:37:51,373 --> 00:37:53,494
that I showed you before, your escape pod

775
00:37:53,614 --> 00:37:55,835
is always just orienting towards the aurora.

776
00:37:56,195 --> 00:37:57,756
So it was basically almost no work,

777
00:37:58,717 --> 00:38:00,778
but it imprints on your mind,

778
00:38:01,178 --> 00:38:02,839
ah, maybe I should go check out the aurora,

779
00:38:03,379 --> 00:38:04,760
even though we'd never dare tell you.

780
00:38:07,065 --> 00:38:11,930
So later in the game, we, Scott, I'm sure you remember this,

781
00:38:12,630 --> 00:38:16,634
we were really struggling with how to deal

782
00:38:16,654 --> 00:38:19,997
with this giant submarine at the bottom of the ocean

783
00:38:20,137 --> 00:38:21,518
with all these huge creatures.

784
00:38:21,538 --> 00:38:22,779
You know, we'd spent all this time putting in

785
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:26,643
those damn huge creatures, and we didn't want guns

786
00:38:26,763 --> 00:38:29,165
on the sub, on the Cyclops, but you know,

787
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:30,426
those creatures are attacking you,

788
00:38:30,546 --> 00:38:31,767
so how are you gonna interact with them?

789
00:38:31,868 --> 00:38:32,448
How is that fun?

790
00:38:33,935 --> 00:38:36,417
And this required a reframe.

791
00:38:36,437 --> 00:38:40,379
And when I say reframe, we had to change our mindset

792
00:38:40,459 --> 00:38:42,219
around the whole thing, which is obviously

793
00:38:42,239 --> 00:38:43,080
a recurring theme here.

794
00:38:45,041 --> 00:38:47,442
We wanted to, you know, we thought maybe we could,

795
00:38:47,502 --> 00:38:50,163
instead of you, instead of this being gameplay,

796
00:38:50,563 --> 00:38:53,905
this can be an experience of being under attack.

797
00:38:54,838 --> 00:38:58,220
So like in Das Boot or Hunt for Red October,

798
00:38:58,660 --> 00:39:00,600
you have those really tense scenes

799
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:01,601
at the bottom of the ocean.

800
00:39:02,261 --> 00:39:04,042
And you can hear the sonar pinging,

801
00:39:04,182 --> 00:39:05,302
and you can hear the creaking.

802
00:39:05,942 --> 00:39:07,263
And we thought, well maybe we can just,

803
00:39:08,003 --> 00:39:09,803
you still can't fight the creatures,

804
00:39:09,943 --> 00:39:11,424
but they're still fighting you,

805
00:39:11,524 --> 00:39:12,604
but you can hide from them.

806
00:39:12,864 --> 00:39:15,545
And you can hit all these buttons and toggles on your sub,

807
00:39:15,625 --> 00:39:17,346
and we can actually make it feel like

808
00:39:17,926 --> 00:39:19,146
a cat and mouse experience.

809
00:39:22,967 --> 00:39:26,790
And in fact, the emergency suite won't be terminated.

810
00:39:34,317 --> 00:39:42,525
So this is a ton of work, like all the UI and the motion detectors and the klaxons and all, you know, later we'll catch fire.

811
00:39:43,326 --> 00:39:46,088
Warning, freedom of attack.

812
00:39:46,128 --> 00:39:46,809
But it wasn't guns.

813
00:39:51,434 --> 00:39:53,015
Warning, fire detector.

814
00:40:10,443 --> 00:40:11,904
So that was a reframe, another reframe.

815
00:40:13,245 --> 00:40:14,426
And here's another one.

816
00:40:14,886 --> 00:40:15,767
Conflict is magic.

817
00:40:16,727 --> 00:40:20,150
We had so much arguing on our team over this five years

818
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,352
and I was starting to wonder

819
00:40:22,412 --> 00:40:23,712
if maybe we're doing something wrong

820
00:40:23,893 --> 00:40:25,774
or maybe I don't even wanna be in games anymore.

821
00:40:25,794 --> 00:40:26,635
This is so unpleasant.

822
00:40:28,297 --> 00:40:33,463
And what I realized was, after I read Creativity Inc. by Pixar,

823
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:36,706
is that the conflict is actually critical.

824
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,989
And it's actually really wonderful, actually.

825
00:40:40,470 --> 00:40:41,431
So here's an example.

826
00:40:42,191 --> 00:40:46,436
You have your creative team who wants the best aesthetic

827
00:40:46,516 --> 00:40:47,697
and all the features.

828
00:40:50,713 --> 00:40:54,475
Then you have the tech team who wants their game to run well

829
00:40:54,515 --> 00:40:55,416
and run on everything.

830
00:40:56,457 --> 00:40:58,858
And then of course you have biz that wants it all on time

831
00:40:59,018 --> 00:40:59,539
and on budget.

832
00:41:00,499 --> 00:41:01,360
That's if you have biz.

833
00:41:01,860 --> 00:41:04,322
I mean, I know not everyone does.

834
00:41:04,422 --> 00:41:12,027
But so if any of those needs are not met,

835
00:41:12,227 --> 00:41:18,131
then you get a bad result. So if creative and biz, they win,

836
00:41:18,351 --> 00:41:19,212
then you get a buggy mess.

837
00:41:20,092 --> 00:41:22,913
You know, if tech and biz get it, you get a tech demo.

838
00:41:23,714 --> 00:41:26,735
And otherwise, you go out of business.

839
00:41:27,355 --> 00:41:31,256
But in the middle, if everyone can compromise and argue

840
00:41:31,276 --> 00:41:33,937
their way to something that you're all grudgingly

841
00:41:34,177 --> 00:41:38,419
agreeable to, that, I learned, is where the magic of games.

842
00:41:38,779 --> 00:41:39,839
That's where magic happens.

843
00:41:42,036 --> 00:41:44,517
And so instead of avoiding conflict,

844
00:41:45,258 --> 00:41:46,879
I started to learn, well, okay,

845
00:41:46,899 --> 00:41:48,099
we just have to be nicer about it,

846
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:49,120
but we can't avoid it.

847
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:50,481
Don't avoid it.

848
00:41:52,862 --> 00:41:55,103
And this is all to say that, you know,

849
00:41:55,243 --> 00:41:57,104
starting off with this idea of a,

850
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:03,036
a game without guns and an underwater game.

851
00:42:03,056 --> 00:42:05,257
You know, we never set out to make a horror game,

852
00:42:05,478 --> 00:42:07,719
and our fans tell us, you made a horror game by mistake.

853
00:42:08,780 --> 00:42:11,002
Or maybe I tell them that, because it's clear that we did.

854
00:42:11,022 --> 00:42:13,424
I mean, I would actually say technically

855
00:42:13,464 --> 00:42:15,226
it's more of a terror game by mistake,

856
00:42:15,566 --> 00:42:17,287
but that's not really,

857
00:42:17,788 --> 00:42:19,069
people don't really talk about terror games.

858
00:42:21,691 --> 00:42:25,454
So, the fact that we did make a terror game by mistake,

859
00:42:25,774 --> 00:42:28,196
I think is the reason why this game came into its own.

860
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:30,949
And it's only because we actually listen to the game.

861
00:42:33,010 --> 00:42:34,470
And this is what Stephen King says

862
00:42:34,530 --> 00:42:37,572
about listening to his characters, which I find creepy.

863
00:42:40,193 --> 00:42:44,675
So there was some quote he had in his book on writing.

864
00:42:45,075 --> 00:42:47,156
He talks about in Misery how he didn't know

865
00:42:47,196 --> 00:42:49,377
how he wanted the book to end.

866
00:42:49,897 --> 00:42:52,278
And he started just listening to Annie.

867
00:42:52,658 --> 00:42:52,958
What's her name?

868
00:42:53,018 --> 00:42:53,419
Is that her name?

869
00:42:53,479 --> 00:42:53,679
Annie?

870
00:42:54,419 --> 00:42:57,320
And the characters started writing themselves.

871
00:42:57,480 --> 00:42:58,461
And they wrote the ending.

872
00:42:59,141 --> 00:43:00,821
And that really rings true with me,

873
00:43:00,921 --> 00:43:02,202
because I feel like that's how it is

874
00:43:02,242 --> 00:43:03,462
when you're making original games.

875
00:43:04,122 --> 00:43:05,763
You kind of think you know where you're going,

876
00:43:05,803 --> 00:43:07,263
you have some place on the horizon,

877
00:43:07,823 --> 00:43:09,904
and some place like it's a mountain,

878
00:43:10,044 --> 00:43:11,084
and there's many paths,

879
00:43:11,144 --> 00:43:12,144
and you don't know how to get there.

880
00:43:12,444 --> 00:43:13,624
But if you listen to the game,

881
00:43:13,765 --> 00:43:15,225
it will tell you where it wants to go.

882
00:43:17,665 --> 00:43:20,366
Okay, so that was the design part of Subnautica,

883
00:43:20,406 --> 00:43:21,906
and now I just wanted to talk a little bit about

884
00:43:22,187 --> 00:43:24,667
like a bigger framework for making your own original games.

885
00:43:26,621 --> 00:43:30,866
So last year I felt like my life was really stuck,

886
00:43:32,188 --> 00:43:36,874
and I felt like maybe I'm addicted to making games.

887
00:43:37,975 --> 00:43:39,877
Maybe I need to investigate that

888
00:43:39,938 --> 00:43:41,039
and stop it for a little while.

889
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:43,101
I just spent all my time doing it.

890
00:43:45,811 --> 00:43:48,332
And I felt like my life might be off track.

891
00:43:49,272 --> 00:43:52,354
And I read this book called Designing Your Life.

892
00:43:53,574 --> 00:43:57,816
It was actually written by one of the co-founders of EA.

893
00:43:58,916 --> 00:44:01,958
And they're two Stanford professors.

894
00:44:01,978 --> 00:44:04,779
And in this book, they talk a lot about this concept

895
00:44:04,819 --> 00:44:06,239
of a wicked problem.

896
00:44:07,391 --> 00:44:11,036
And they talk about how people's lives are actually wicked problems.

897
00:44:11,617 --> 00:44:15,362
And these are problems that are highly resistant to solving.

898
00:44:15,863 --> 00:44:18,446
In fact, maybe there is no solving of a wicked problem.

899
00:44:20,188 --> 00:44:22,091
Because our lives certainly cannot be solved.

900
00:44:22,331 --> 00:44:24,995
They can only become subjectively better or worse.

901
00:44:27,141 --> 00:44:29,002
So I was reading about these wicked problems,

902
00:44:29,583 --> 00:44:31,204
and here are their main characteristics

903
00:44:31,244 --> 00:44:32,305
that they talk about.

904
00:44:32,645 --> 00:44:35,447
Now keep in mind, you know, wicked problems,

905
00:44:35,687 --> 00:44:37,949
they're not saying it's only life, people's lives.

906
00:44:37,969 --> 00:44:40,431
They're also saying, you know, nuclear weapons,

907
00:44:40,711 --> 00:44:45,254
homelessness, you know, poverty, you know, climate change.

908
00:44:45,495 --> 00:44:46,796
These are all wicked problems.

909
00:44:47,156 --> 00:44:48,097
So what do they say about them?

910
00:44:49,097 --> 00:44:51,619
They say they're not understood until after

911
00:44:51,659 --> 00:44:54,782
the formulation of a solution, okay?

912
00:44:56,305 --> 00:44:57,186
You don't know when you're done.

913
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,687
They say there's no stopping point.

914
00:44:59,947 --> 00:45:01,368
So it's not solved.

915
00:45:02,188 --> 00:45:03,729
Solutions are not right or wrong.

916
00:45:06,691 --> 00:45:09,412
Each problem is essentially novel and unique.

917
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:15,515
And every potential solution is a one-shot operation,

918
00:45:15,695 --> 00:45:17,536
which means you can't ever get better at it.

919
00:45:18,097 --> 00:45:18,997
There's no trial and error.

920
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:25,283
And there's no body of existing solutions out there,

921
00:45:25,723 --> 00:45:28,525
unlike if you're building bridges or highways

922
00:45:28,605 --> 00:45:31,447
or skyscrapers, there's all this engineering work out there.

923
00:45:31,468 --> 00:45:32,849
You can just go look up solutions.

924
00:45:33,369 --> 00:45:34,590
Wicked problems don't have these things.

925
00:45:34,610 --> 00:45:36,912
So then I thought, this sounds kind of familiar.

926
00:45:36,932 --> 00:45:39,754
This is pretty much exactly like making any original game.

927
00:45:40,814 --> 00:45:43,136
And I realized that actually, original games,

928
00:45:43,516 --> 00:45:45,838
making original games are original problems.

929
00:45:46,158 --> 00:45:47,740
I mean, they're wicked problems.

930
00:45:49,547 --> 00:45:52,028
And we have to think about them in a completely different way

931
00:45:52,068 --> 00:45:53,709
than any other type of problem solving.

932
00:45:55,570 --> 00:45:57,771
So each original game is unique.

933
00:45:59,252 --> 00:46:00,173
There's no end point.

934
00:46:01,714 --> 00:46:02,514
It's never solved.

935
00:46:03,795 --> 00:46:04,855
Again, no trial and error.

936
00:46:06,917 --> 00:46:08,177
And there's no existing solutions.

937
00:46:09,478 --> 00:46:11,920
So this is the whole idea of being in the jungle.

938
00:46:12,999 --> 00:46:15,642
This is not knowing what you're making,

939
00:46:15,802 --> 00:46:19,065
and yet you still have to go ahead and make progress anyways.

940
00:46:19,085 --> 00:46:23,730
There's another quote that I really liked.

941
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:28,716
And I think that's really true.

942
00:46:29,516 --> 00:46:31,599
Games are insanely complex.

943
00:46:31,679 --> 00:46:33,821
If you want to do something new, it's going to be even harder.

944
00:46:37,349 --> 00:46:42,913
So this book talks about their framework for design thinking,

945
00:46:43,233 --> 00:46:44,574
which they did not create.

946
00:46:44,694 --> 00:46:47,256
This is a known discipline, essentially.

947
00:46:47,857 --> 00:46:49,738
And design thinking, some of the things they talk about

948
00:46:50,399 --> 00:46:53,181
are try stuff, which is prototyping,

949
00:46:53,962 --> 00:46:55,843
and what they call building your way forward.

950
00:46:57,385 --> 00:46:58,826
They talk about reframing problems.

951
00:47:02,478 --> 00:47:07,183
knowing it's a process, which is to say that sometimes you take a step forward and a couple

952
00:47:07,203 --> 00:47:09,966
steps back, sometimes you have happy accidents along the way.

953
00:47:11,648 --> 00:47:12,729
They talk about wayfinding.

954
00:47:13,270 --> 00:47:16,353
Wayfinding is the idea that you think you know where you're going, or you've got it

955
00:47:16,413 --> 00:47:19,416
on the horizon and you're just going to aim there, but you have no idea how you're going

956
00:47:19,437 --> 00:47:19,817
to get there.

957
00:47:21,339 --> 00:47:22,280
And they say, ask for help.

958
00:47:24,420 --> 00:47:28,364
Then I started thinking, well, the stuff that worked really well in Subnautica fits pretty

959
00:47:28,424 --> 00:47:29,605
well into these categories.

960
00:47:30,366 --> 00:47:32,607
Trying stuff, that's the MVP and MCP.

961
00:47:33,708 --> 00:47:36,851
Minutes of fun, that's building your way forward pretty much identically.

962
00:47:37,912 --> 00:47:38,613
Placeholder goals.

963
00:47:40,226 --> 00:47:44,808
Okay, reframing problems is probably the most important thing that we ever did, which is

964
00:47:45,388 --> 00:47:52,012
reframing player learning, intrinsic rewards instead of extrinsic, embracing conflict,

965
00:47:53,172 --> 00:47:57,174
rethinking how the sub works, knowing it's a process.

966
00:47:57,574 --> 00:48:02,897
A lot of this for us was embracing those happy accidents and noticing them, the listening.

967
00:48:05,202 --> 00:48:08,325
And yeah, the awe through the big creatures and the training wheels.

968
00:48:09,366 --> 00:48:10,487
We just noticed that those worked.

969
00:48:11,268 --> 00:48:15,672
And wayfinding, probably the most important one, which is the whole idea of knowing where

970
00:48:15,692 --> 00:48:19,376
you want to go, at least emotionally, and just aiming for it.

971
00:48:21,197 --> 00:48:22,058
So that just leaves one.

972
00:48:25,514 --> 00:48:29,098
So we've covered a lot of tools about finding your way

973
00:48:29,119 --> 00:48:30,861
through that jungle of making original games.

974
00:48:32,002 --> 00:48:34,465
And I would not say that it's gonna make development easy,

975
00:48:34,785 --> 00:48:37,008
but I'm hoping it's gonna make it a little bit easier.

976
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:42,054
And it's easy to forget that other people

977
00:48:42,094 --> 00:48:43,376
have walked this path before us.

978
00:48:44,477 --> 00:48:45,778
And that we don't have to do this alone.

979
00:48:46,982 --> 00:48:52,285
So I hope that you remember that there's help all around you and what's difficult or impossible

980
00:48:52,325 --> 00:48:55,186
for you may suddenly become easy with a little bit of help from someone else.

981
00:48:56,567 --> 00:49:01,389
Especially here at GDC, the friendships that you make here will last you your entire career.

982
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:07,312
So if you'd be so kind, would you please take a moment and introduce yourself to your neighbor?

983
00:49:33,679 --> 00:49:35,440
Okay, I hate to cut you off.

984
00:49:35,460 --> 00:49:35,620
Wow.

985
00:49:35,660 --> 00:49:36,361
That was amazing.

986
00:50:05,147 --> 00:50:11,070
Okay. One moment. Yeah, we're back. I didn't think that was going to take so long. Wow.

987
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:20,394
Holy moly. You guys are energetic. Okay. One more thing. Wow. It's gone. It's done.

988
00:50:22,174 --> 00:50:23,295
Okay. That's it. Okay.

989
00:50:24,115 --> 00:50:29,337
Thank you.

990
00:50:32,599 --> 00:50:34,320
So I think we have maybe ten minutes for Q&A.

991
00:50:36,310 --> 00:50:39,885
Uh, yeah, 10. Okay. I don't know. I don't know where the mics are, but here, here.

992
00:50:45,010 --> 00:50:46,971
Hi, John Manning from Secret Lab.

993
00:50:46,991 --> 00:50:47,351
Hi.

994
00:50:48,212 --> 00:50:55,135
So can you talk a little bit about how you implemented the

995
00:50:55,195 --> 00:50:58,996
story over the course of your open access, your early access?

996
00:50:59,016 --> 00:51:01,577
Because how did you deal with player spoilers?

997
00:51:01,617 --> 00:51:06,059
How did you take care of things like changing your mind as you

998
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:06,880
built out the story?

999
00:51:07,915 --> 00:51:13,118
Oh man, so the question was like how did we unveil the story basically in early access

1000
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:15,480
knowing that sometimes we needed to change things?

1001
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:20,817
very painstakingly and carefully.

1002
00:51:20,837 --> 00:51:25,540
I mean, one thing we realized is we didn't care about spoilers.

1003
00:51:26,021 --> 00:51:27,501
Obviously, in early access, you can't,

1004
00:51:27,842 --> 00:51:30,363
but there was always some team resistance saying,

1005
00:51:30,403 --> 00:51:32,645
well, do we really want to spoil this right now

1006
00:51:32,725 --> 00:51:35,507
because it's going to remove all the juice from the game?

1007
00:51:36,147 --> 00:51:38,549
We basically just let people be spoiled,

1008
00:51:39,209 --> 00:51:41,370
and if they didn't want to be spoiled,

1009
00:51:41,410 --> 00:51:43,412
we thought they just shouldn't be playing early access.

1010
00:51:44,352 --> 00:51:45,993
But I, unfortunately, don't really have a good,

1011
00:51:46,573 --> 00:51:47,894
terse answer for you on that.

1012
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:49,374
I wish I could help.

1013
00:51:49,815 --> 00:51:50,975
Conflict, need a lot of conflict.

1014
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:53,296
Hi, over here.

1015
00:51:53,436 --> 00:51:53,836
Hi.

1016
00:51:54,056 --> 00:51:56,117
I have to say, this is just an amazing game.

1017
00:51:56,137 --> 00:51:56,978
Oh, thank you.

1018
00:51:57,058 --> 00:51:58,198
Really great accomplishment.

1019
00:51:58,498 --> 00:51:59,599
Thanks for the presentation.

1020
00:52:00,319 --> 00:52:02,140
You mentioned something about telemetrics

1021
00:52:02,540 --> 00:52:03,980
and telemetry that you used in the game.

1022
00:52:04,801 --> 00:52:08,542
How much did that influence early development

1023
00:52:08,642 --> 00:52:10,883
and what were the things that you were actually looking at?

1024
00:52:11,450 --> 00:52:13,912
So Jonas, I think, talked a lot about that in his talk.

1025
00:52:14,753 --> 00:52:16,955
But we did look at it a lot.

1026
00:52:17,695 --> 00:52:19,637
Our discussions were often, players

1027
00:52:20,357 --> 00:52:22,559
haven't found the Seamoth yet, and it's four hours in.

1028
00:52:22,579 --> 00:52:25,361
Because we had the data among the team.

1029
00:52:26,102 --> 00:52:27,723
So I think it was really important

1030
00:52:27,783 --> 00:52:29,364
that everyone had access to that,

1031
00:52:29,725 --> 00:52:30,645
so we could all talk about it.

1032
00:52:31,466 --> 00:52:37,129
and it wasn't like, as you probably have come to understand now, this wasn't like this top-down

1033
00:52:37,649 --> 00:52:38,689
designer-driven game.

1034
00:52:38,890 --> 00:52:39,850
No, it doesn't seem like that.

1035
00:52:39,930 --> 00:52:45,573
No, the team is talking about this stuff and as soon as they had that data, it just informed

1036
00:52:45,633 --> 00:52:46,313
all their discussions.

1037
00:52:46,913 --> 00:52:49,215
So we used it and we used it a lot.

1038
00:52:49,615 --> 00:52:49,835
Cool.

1039
00:52:50,155 --> 00:52:51,316
And it's actually pretty easy to implement.

1040
00:52:51,516 --> 00:52:53,056
Yeah, I'll take a look at the other talk as well.

1041
00:52:53,116 --> 00:52:53,597
Okay, yeah, great.

1042
00:52:53,617 --> 00:52:54,037
Cheers, thanks.

1043
00:52:54,597 --> 00:52:54,817
Hi there.

1044
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:55,900
Hi, thanks for the talk.

1045
00:52:56,040 --> 00:52:57,902
Could I just ask, did you have to iterate much

1046
00:52:58,002 --> 00:52:59,803
on the rendering or the design of the hands?

1047
00:52:59,823 --> 00:53:02,365
Were there any decisions there about the uncanny valley?

1048
00:53:02,385 --> 00:53:03,286
I'm sorry, say that one more time.

1049
00:53:03,426 --> 00:53:05,407
So the rendering and the modeling of the hands

1050
00:53:05,808 --> 00:53:07,809
in the game, because they're kind of always there,

1051
00:53:07,849 --> 00:53:10,651
and there's this whole worry about the uncanny valley.

1052
00:53:10,951 --> 00:53:12,893
Did that just work, or did you have

1053
00:53:12,913 --> 00:53:13,933
to iterate on that a little bit?

1054
00:53:14,407 --> 00:53:15,988
I mean, Brian would probably have...

1055
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:18,091
I think it just worked, yeah.

1056
00:53:18,111 --> 00:53:20,013
I don't think we ever had a problem with the hands.

1057
00:53:21,555 --> 00:53:23,196
Maybe the legs were a little more difficult.

1058
00:53:23,537 --> 00:53:24,257
I don't know, but...

1059
00:53:24,278 --> 00:53:25,819
All right, thank you.

1060
00:53:25,919 --> 00:53:28,022
Yeah, I think it never really worked that great in VR,

1061
00:53:28,662 --> 00:53:30,524
but sorry.

1062
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:36,502
Thanks for sharing. Carl from University of Wisconsin Stout.

1063
00:53:36,883 --> 00:53:39,165
My question is related to research and design.

1064
00:53:39,205 --> 00:53:41,186
Did you take any inspiration?

1065
00:53:41,206 --> 00:53:42,828
Did you go out and snorkel or scuba dive?

1066
00:53:42,848 --> 00:53:43,949
Yeah. First hand experience?

1067
00:53:44,089 --> 00:53:46,631
I did, actually. I'm an avid scuba diver.

1068
00:53:48,012 --> 00:53:50,814
That scares the living hell out of me still.

1069
00:53:51,415 --> 00:53:52,776
It's funny, I don't get scared about Subnautica,

1070
00:53:52,816 --> 00:53:54,637
but I get really scared in actual scuba.

1071
00:53:56,149 --> 00:54:02,030
Yeah, I mean, I think we have a couple members on the team that are scuba people, but we

1072
00:54:02,090 --> 00:54:03,350
didn't really do too much.

1073
00:54:03,610 --> 00:54:07,451
We had like, I don't think we ever had a field trip or anything.

1074
00:54:08,452 --> 00:54:14,633
No, I mean, our art team, Corey especially, researches the heck out of underwater life,

1075
00:54:15,313 --> 00:54:18,754
but I think I was probably only one or two people that actually scuba dive.

1076
00:54:19,134 --> 00:54:19,314
Yeah.

1077
00:54:20,034 --> 00:54:20,214
Thanks.

1078
00:54:20,274 --> 00:54:20,775
So, yeah.

1079
00:54:21,755 --> 00:54:21,975
Hi there.

1080
00:54:22,435 --> 00:54:22,515
Hey.

1081
00:54:24,692 --> 00:54:33,897
like talked about the inspiration for a lot of your gameplay mechanics came from like kernels like the hunt for red october where you're evading that there's those tense moments where you're evading

1082
00:54:34,878 --> 00:54:46,124
when you design this game because it was so from the ground up what was the kernel for the original concept like was there a particular experience that the like home came out of

1083
00:54:47,965 --> 00:54:48,385
like the

1084
00:54:50,538 --> 00:54:52,140
What was the initial inspiration?

1085
00:54:52,180 --> 00:54:54,061
You know, I don't know if there actually was one.

1086
00:54:54,502 --> 00:54:56,143
I mean, I love the Abyss.

1087
00:54:56,163 --> 00:54:57,544
I love James Cameron films.

1088
00:54:57,865 --> 00:55:00,027
So those were always, you know, there.

1089
00:55:01,668 --> 00:55:05,271
But gosh, I mean, we were definitely influenced by Avatar.

1090
00:55:05,872 --> 00:55:08,534
We wanted to make a dreamy, dreamy, surreal world

1091
00:55:08,854 --> 00:55:10,335
with a lot of like alien nature.

1092
00:55:10,816 --> 00:55:13,378
I don't know if there's actually one specific experience.

1093
00:55:13,438 --> 00:55:16,841
It's more of a feeling than an experience, honestly.

1094
00:55:16,861 --> 00:55:17,321
Cool.

1095
00:55:17,622 --> 00:55:21,848
Yeah, and underwater Minecraft was like an early direction.

1096
00:55:22,029 --> 00:55:25,113
That was like probably the original, and it just wasn't good.

1097
00:55:26,604 --> 00:55:28,145
Okay, so you said let's not do that.

1098
00:55:28,445 --> 00:55:29,065
Let's not do that.

1099
00:55:29,185 --> 00:55:29,565
Oh, okay.

1100
00:55:29,585 --> 00:55:31,726
The building, I could've gone into depth on that,

1101
00:55:31,766 --> 00:55:33,526
but the building basically got in the way

1102
00:55:33,546 --> 00:55:36,467
of the exploration because we actually had subs

1103
00:55:36,507 --> 00:55:38,567
that you could build pieces onto, like modularly,

1104
00:55:38,707 --> 00:55:41,568
and it would change their properties,

1105
00:55:41,628 --> 00:55:42,548
like how they navigate.

1106
00:55:43,348 --> 00:55:44,689
And then you couldn't actually explore

1107
00:55:44,749 --> 00:55:45,629
because they were so clumsy.

1108
00:55:46,049 --> 00:55:48,530
So we realized that the game was about the discovery

1109
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:49,950
and exploration, not about building.

1110
00:55:50,710 --> 00:55:51,310
Yeah, it shows.

1111
00:55:51,630 --> 00:55:52,270
Okay, good.

1112
00:55:52,671 --> 00:55:53,311
That's good, I guess.

1113
00:55:53,331 --> 00:55:53,371
Hi.

1114
00:55:54,582 --> 00:55:57,444
Hi there, my name's Matthew Owens, I'm a designer with EA.

1115
00:55:57,684 --> 00:55:58,885
I thought it was really fascinating,

1116
00:55:59,065 --> 00:56:00,626
your concept of placeholder goals,

1117
00:56:00,686 --> 00:56:02,067
along with having placeholder models.

1118
00:56:02,747 --> 00:56:04,408
How did you go about the process

1119
00:56:04,528 --> 00:56:05,709
of getting the permanent goals?

1120
00:56:05,749 --> 00:56:07,430
Was it more of a process of discovery,

1121
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:10,171
where the right concept came to you over time,

1122
00:56:10,231 --> 00:56:11,512
or did you have to really sit down and say,

1123
00:56:11,612 --> 00:56:12,833
what the heck are we actually doing with our game?

1124
00:56:13,047 --> 00:56:17,248
I mean, we don't really have any real goals in the game.

1125
00:56:17,388 --> 00:56:19,809
I mean, they're there, but we would never tell you.

1126
00:56:19,829 --> 00:56:22,971
So I mean, you kind of, all the story,

1127
00:56:22,991 --> 00:56:24,911
I mean, you could say that the story is the goal,

1128
00:56:25,672 --> 00:56:28,873
and that's all just there if you want to find it,

1129
00:56:28,953 --> 00:56:30,654
and we've got breadcrumbs all over the place

1130
00:56:30,694 --> 00:56:32,554
to help you find it, but there's really...

1131
00:56:33,455 --> 00:56:37,495
I mean, I wouldn't say, you could say that there's goals in the Fabricator, like I really

1132
00:56:37,515 --> 00:56:41,336
want to build my first Cyclops, or I want to build, you know, I don't know, this underwater

1133
00:56:41,376 --> 00:56:44,897
base that looks like in this configuration, but they're all implicit.

1134
00:56:45,297 --> 00:56:50,778
There's nothing, I wouldn't say that we have any actual goals in the game that we decided

1135
00:56:50,838 --> 00:56:50,898
on.

1136
00:56:50,918 --> 00:56:52,078
All right, cool, thank you.

1137
00:56:52,118 --> 00:56:52,698
Yeah, you're welcome.

1138
00:56:53,878 --> 00:56:54,118
Hi there.

1139
00:56:54,638 --> 00:56:57,779
I've got about a billion questions, but I'm going to just go with this.

1140
00:56:58,519 --> 00:57:00,679
I wanted to actually thank you guys a whole lot.

1141
00:57:03,825 --> 00:57:07,068
playing this game as a frustrated explorer and oceanographer,

1142
00:57:08,149 --> 00:57:11,733
it really scratched an itch that I knew was there,

1143
00:57:11,753 --> 00:57:14,636
but I didn't know how to frame it.

1144
00:57:16,878 --> 00:57:19,841
But like I say, I just want to thank you guys a lot for putting this out.

1145
00:57:19,881 --> 00:57:21,382
Very welcome.

1146
00:57:23,984 --> 00:57:27,688
Hi. Hi. You talked a little bit about the pyramid-shaped map

1147
00:57:27,708 --> 00:57:28,209
to sort of...

1148
00:57:30,750 --> 00:57:33,532
influence and motivate players to go deeper.

1149
00:57:34,493 --> 00:57:36,575
But how did, like, my question's about the biomes,

1150
00:57:36,595 --> 00:57:39,116
like the discreet and very unique biomes

1151
00:57:39,156 --> 00:57:40,537
that are very distinct from each other.

1152
00:57:41,398 --> 00:57:44,220
Did you guys design that through the lens of emotions,

1153
00:57:44,280 --> 00:57:46,542
because each of them sort of evoke a certain emotion,

1154
00:57:46,562 --> 00:57:48,823
or did you have certain gameplay things

1155
00:57:48,843 --> 00:57:49,704
that you wanted them to do?

1156
00:57:49,824 --> 00:57:52,165
I mean, it's a lot fuzzier, so the question was about,

1157
00:57:52,185 --> 00:57:55,588
like, did we use the design pillars, basically,

1158
00:57:55,608 --> 00:57:56,769
for making the biomes?

1159
00:57:56,849 --> 00:57:57,009
Yeah.

1160
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:04,582
I hope so. I wasn't really involved too much with level design. So the art team, that's

1161
00:58:04,622 --> 00:58:09,083
actually something that I cut out of this talk, but early on I realized I had to remove

1162
00:58:09,163 --> 00:58:16,425
myself from the world design, which was a really weird realization because art wanted

1163
00:58:16,545 --> 00:58:21,487
to, art had ideas, like they wanted to make this like huge submarine, right, because it

1164
00:58:21,507 --> 00:58:21,987
looks so cool.

1165
00:58:23,190 --> 00:58:26,052
level design wanted to figure out how to get that submarine to fit.

1166
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:29,235
And, you know, like we need, they need to make biomes that are big enough

1167
00:58:29,255 --> 00:58:32,117
that, you know, they don't have the, you know, giant plants that are going to

1168
00:58:32,157 --> 00:58:34,439
stick up and your sub gets stuck on them or whatever.

1169
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,961
And they would ask me, like,

1170
00:58:38,082 --> 00:58:39,322
How big is this world supposed to be?

1171
00:58:39,362 --> 00:58:41,402
How long is it going to take to get from one biome to another?

1172
00:58:41,462 --> 00:58:42,623
And I didn't have any answers for them.

1173
00:58:42,643 --> 00:58:46,344
I would ask Corey, our artist, our art director,

1174
00:58:46,904 --> 00:58:49,024
I have questions for him on crafting ingredients.

1175
00:58:49,084 --> 00:58:51,565
So we were stuck in this circular dependency.

1176
00:58:52,185 --> 00:58:54,865
And I realized the only way we could make forward progress

1177
00:58:54,905 --> 00:58:58,346
on the world design would be for me to leave that discussion

1178
00:58:58,886 --> 00:59:01,727
and let them make the world that they think that they can make.

1179
00:59:02,407 --> 00:59:05,390
So artists in Love Design made the world that they loved,

1180
00:59:05,610 --> 00:59:07,991
and I had to fit the gameplay to the world.

1181
00:59:08,832 --> 00:59:11,194
So I wish I could tell you more about that,

1182
00:59:11,234 --> 00:59:15,337
but I actually deliberately had to leave those discussions.

1183
00:59:16,418 --> 00:59:16,818
Thank you.

1184
00:59:16,858 --> 00:59:17,799
Sorry, it's a terrible answer.

1185
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:18,920
No, it was a great answer.

1186
00:59:19,800 --> 00:59:21,281
So a lot of your design,

1187
00:59:21,342 --> 00:59:23,243
or I don't know how much of your design,

1188
00:59:23,883 --> 00:59:27,466
came from streamers and YouTubers on Early Access.

1189
00:59:27,926 --> 00:59:29,908
Would you always go down that route

1190
00:59:29,988 --> 00:59:31,189
knowing what you know today?

1191
00:59:32,396 --> 00:59:35,037
Yes, only because I don't think of them as...

1192
00:59:35,877 --> 00:59:38,358
It's not about how popular they are or anything like that.

1193
00:59:38,438 --> 00:59:40,059
It's just about watching someone play the game.

1194
00:59:41,740 --> 00:59:43,981
Of course you can see the likes and dislikes

1195
00:59:44,041 --> 00:59:46,762
and the number of views that will influence you sometimes.

1196
00:59:47,503 --> 00:59:48,683
But I don't feel like...

1197
00:59:49,724 --> 00:59:53,206
I was kind of worried that this was going to come across like we were just chasing the

1198
00:59:53,646 --> 00:59:54,286
jump scares.

1199
00:59:54,886 --> 00:59:56,067
And I don't think that we did.

1200
00:59:56,087 --> 01:00:00,650
I mean, I guess we probably did to an extent, but I don't think we ever made decisions with

1201
01:00:00,690 --> 01:00:02,991
the game that we weren't 100% behind.

1202
01:00:03,571 --> 01:00:07,734
We would never, you know, we would never just say like, oh, people want this, like someone

1203
01:00:08,014 --> 01:00:12,296
modded in a Torp, like, I don't know, some kind of blade gun or something and people

1204
01:00:12,356 --> 01:00:12,697
loved it.

1205
01:00:12,957 --> 01:00:13,657
We wouldn't put that in.

1206
01:00:14,059 --> 01:00:15,600
I'm a big fan of early access.

1207
01:00:15,840 --> 01:00:16,080
Okay.

1208
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,682
I like it when the player has the fun and yeah, of course.

1209
01:00:18,742 --> 01:00:19,042
Yeah.

1210
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:19,722
So good job.

1211
01:00:20,283 --> 01:00:24,305
I think, I mean definitely, I can't imagine, this is the world we live in now, right, with

1212
01:00:24,345 --> 01:00:24,726
streamers.

1213
01:00:25,286 --> 01:00:31,330
So we probably make half of our income from streamers, pretty much directly.

1214
01:00:32,090 --> 01:00:34,052
So it used to be when a video went up,

1215
01:00:34,452 --> 01:00:36,034
our sales would just go, you'd just

1216
01:00:36,074 --> 01:00:38,015
be 100% correlated to that.

1217
01:00:38,556 --> 01:00:40,737
So I think it would be folly to ignore it.

1218
01:00:41,378 --> 01:00:43,620
And I think they're here to stay.

1219
01:00:43,660 --> 01:00:44,981
And we love watching them.

1220
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:46,802
It gives us energy when we see what people love,

1221
01:00:48,103 --> 01:00:49,425
even the non-famous ones, too.

1222
01:00:50,025 --> 01:00:51,126
So hi.

1223
01:00:51,967 --> 01:00:52,127
Hi.

1224
01:00:53,868 --> 01:00:56,470
Question regarding the data bank and the fact

1225
01:00:56,510 --> 01:00:58,332
that you can scan all the creatures and stuff.

1226
01:01:00,710 --> 01:01:02,932
Where did that fit into the whole design of the game?

1227
01:01:02,952 --> 01:01:03,452
Good question.

1228
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:04,193
Why did you decide to do that?

1229
01:01:04,313 --> 01:01:04,693
Yeah.

1230
01:01:05,293 --> 01:01:07,315
I was actually really against the scanner.

1231
01:01:07,395 --> 01:01:09,197
So the question was, how does the scanner

1232
01:01:09,357 --> 01:01:11,698
fit into the game, into the design pillars, I guess.

1233
01:01:12,299 --> 01:01:13,800
It doesn't really, honestly.

1234
01:01:14,200 --> 01:01:15,221
And I never really liked it.

1235
01:01:16,783 --> 01:01:20,726
But the team really liked the idea, and they put it in.

1236
01:01:22,207 --> 01:01:26,171
I think it works well for the feeling of exploration.

1237
01:01:26,971 --> 01:01:29,934
Every time you see something new, you want to go scan it.

1238
01:01:30,915 --> 01:01:33,037
And it also is a nice replacement for combat,

1239
01:01:33,297 --> 01:01:36,880
because you can't really interact with the creatures too much,

1240
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:37,841
but you can scan them.

1241
01:01:38,642 --> 01:01:41,603
And just like combat, you have to see how they're moving,

1242
01:01:41,963 --> 01:01:43,764
get close to them, make sure they don't hurt you,

1243
01:01:44,204 --> 01:01:47,306
and keep them in your sights long enough to get them scanned.

1244
01:01:47,726 --> 01:01:49,507
So I think it actually is a nice proxy

1245
01:01:49,567 --> 01:01:52,088
for very simple, light combat.

1246
01:01:52,608 --> 01:01:54,749
So I wholeheartedly love it now.

1247
01:01:56,350 --> 01:01:56,570
Thanks.

1248
01:01:56,790 --> 01:01:57,290
Yeah, you're welcome.

1249
01:01:57,991 --> 01:01:58,271
Is that it?

1250
01:01:58,731 --> 01:02:00,052
I think we're probably out of time anyway, so.

1251
01:02:00,592 --> 01:02:01,112
Thank you everyone.

1252
01:02:01,132 --> 01:02:01,913
Have a great GDC.
