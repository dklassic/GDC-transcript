00:00:00,829 --> 00:00:02,170
Good morning everyone.

2
00:00:03,011 --> 00:00:04,613
Welcome to the GDC Twitch channel.

3
00:00:04,653 --> 00:00:06,314
My name is Bryant Francis here.

4
00:00:06,334 --> 00:00:08,677
I've got the games going a little bit loud there,

5
00:00:08,717 --> 00:00:10,859
so your ears may have popped slightly at home.

6
00:00:11,319 --> 00:00:12,981
Sorry about that.

7
00:00:13,041 --> 00:00:13,661
Turned down the volume.

8
00:00:15,183 --> 00:00:16,764
Welcome again to the GDC Twitch channel.

9
00:00:16,784 --> 00:00:17,945
My name is Bryant Francis.

10
00:00:18,205 --> 00:00:20,267
I am a Community Manager at GDC.

11
00:00:20,888 --> 00:00:23,489
and a contributing editor at GammaSutra.com.

12
00:00:24,230 --> 00:00:29,232
What you are watching in front of you is a game called Mutant Year Zero, Road to Eden.

13
00:00:30,413 --> 00:00:39,098
It is a game about the life and legend of one talking duck named Dux and his pig friend.

14
00:00:39,118 --> 00:00:43,200
I'm forgetting the pig friend's name. Could someone... one of our guests in Sweden...

15
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,421
I missed that. One more time?

16
00:00:46,812 --> 00:00:49,133
Bormin, right. Yeah.

17
00:00:49,173 --> 00:00:50,473
The Adventures of Ducks and Bormin.

18
00:00:50,533 --> 00:00:56,355
It's like Frog and Toad, as they talk about life's mysteries, life's great delights.

19
00:00:58,715 --> 00:01:07,018
Or, if you're actually a person who knows what this game is, it's a strategy RPG from the developers at The Bearded Lady Consulting.

20
00:01:07,518 --> 00:01:11,379
Three members of which are down in the lower left-hand corner of your screen.

21
00:01:12,559 --> 00:01:14,820
Lee, could you introduce yourself, just to get us started?

22
00:01:16,090 --> 00:01:17,851
Yeah, hi, I'm Lee and I'm the game director.

23
00:01:20,793 --> 00:01:23,054
And also the lead level designer, you could say.

24
00:01:23,074 --> 00:01:25,275
We're the lead artist as well.

25
00:01:25,775 --> 00:01:27,016
Oh, yeah.

26
00:01:27,036 --> 00:01:28,756
Kalle's gonna have no objections to that.

27
00:01:31,618 --> 00:01:36,960
Lee, who has joined you today on our mysterious adventure through a post-apocalyptic wasteland?

28
00:01:37,901 --> 00:01:44,624
So we have Kalle, our real lead artist, and animator.

29
00:01:45,564 --> 00:01:51,451
And David, who is the co-director of the project, and the technical director, and the lead programmer, and...

30
00:01:52,492 --> 00:01:53,133
Yeah.

31
00:01:53,153 --> 00:01:54,735
We're a small crew, so we have many hats.

32
00:01:55,182 --> 00:01:56,343
Yeah.

33
00:01:56,463 --> 00:01:58,524
Callie and David, thank you also for joining us.

34
00:01:58,944 --> 00:02:01,985
If you're watching from home, if you're like me in California,

35
00:02:02,026 --> 00:02:02,906
it's very early.

36
00:02:02,926 --> 00:02:05,347
If you're on the West Coast, thank you for joining us early.

37
00:02:05,787 --> 00:02:08,469
If you're in chat and you're from elsewhere in the world,

38
00:02:08,489 --> 00:02:10,890
well, thank you for joining anyway, even if it's not as early.

39
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:15,012
This is a Q&A stream.

40
00:02:15,092 --> 00:02:17,713
Just a full disclosure, the footage you are seeing in front of you,

41
00:02:18,753 --> 00:02:24,556
This is from an older demo of the game, so you might see a couple of hiccups like that one that just came by.

42
00:02:24,996 --> 00:02:34,220
And it's pre-recorded footage, so unfortunately you can't yell at me when I screw up, which you're going to watch me screw up, because you don't need to be good at video games sometimes to do this job.

43
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,801
You just need to be able to make the shooty shooty bang bang happen.

44
00:02:39,962 --> 00:02:44,466
To get things started, we're also going to point out this is a game where we're talking about this from GDC.

45
00:02:44,486 --> 00:02:50,290
At GDC, we like talking to interesting game developers, which most of them are interesting.

46
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:53,472
It's just a question of how interesting. That was meaner than I intended.

47
00:02:56,414 --> 00:03:00,838
We are here talking about how games get made, we are here talking about how sometimes games

48
00:03:00,878 --> 00:03:03,721
get marketed, or the process of running a small studio.

49
00:03:03,741 --> 00:03:05,783
This is what we're going to be talking about today.

50
00:03:05,863 --> 00:03:10,307
If you have questions about sort of nitty gritty things about the game from a perspective

51
00:03:10,347 --> 00:03:12,209
of playing it, we'll try to work it in.

52
00:03:12,309 --> 00:03:15,552
But if you're in chat, please ask questions for these fine folks.

53
00:03:16,473 --> 00:03:20,997
They have answers for you about making strategy games, stealth games, and all kinds of other

54
00:03:21,037 --> 00:03:21,598
fun stuff.

55
00:03:22,378 --> 00:03:26,680
To get things started, Lee, David, and Cal, would you mind explaining...

56
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:27,420
Cali, sorry.

57
00:03:27,900 --> 00:03:31,521
Would you mind explaining what your background is on the project?

58
00:03:31,921 --> 00:03:36,323
And I know this is an adaptation of a Swedish pen and paper RPG.

59
00:03:36,343 --> 00:03:41,545
Would you mind explaining how this game got started and how you settled on the vision

60
00:03:41,565 --> 00:03:42,385
of where this game would go?

61
00:03:45,741 --> 00:03:46,141
You hear me?

62
00:03:46,401 --> 00:03:49,243
Yeah, I think David was the original when it was started.

63
00:03:49,423 --> 00:03:51,965
David, yeah, let's hear your take.

64
00:03:52,125 --> 00:03:56,107
So League is British, so it didn't grow up with us, but me and Kelle did.

65
00:03:56,628 --> 00:03:57,168
Mm-hmm.

66
00:03:57,809 --> 00:04:04,353
And it was a long time coming. It's actually something we wanted to do about eight years ago, seven, eight years ago.

67
00:04:04,453 --> 00:04:13,498
We started looking at making this game, but we were not experienced enough, and we didn't have the manpower or the muscle to do it.

68
00:04:14,108 --> 00:04:18,230
So it's been a long time dream to get to do it.

69
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,411
And then, I don't know, three years ago or something like that, we started up.

70
00:04:23,752 --> 00:04:30,054
I just played XCOM again on Iron Man and decided that the world could need a little bit more

71
00:04:30,074 --> 00:04:30,715
of that genre.

72
00:04:30,735 --> 00:04:33,396
So that was kind of the...

73
00:04:33,596 --> 00:04:38,538
It was something we were looking at already seven, eight years ago, making some sort of

74
00:04:38,858 --> 00:04:42,560
turn-based tactical game out of it, because we figured that would be...

75
00:04:43,552 --> 00:04:46,772
what would suit the RPG well and the size of our studio.

76
00:04:47,713 --> 00:04:55,015
So yeah, I called Kalle up and I had just quit my job at IO to do this kind of thing.

77
00:04:56,375 --> 00:05:01,916
And I was lucky enough that Kalle was also kind of in the middle of things and we started

78
00:05:01,956 --> 00:05:07,958
making prototypes three years ago and then got Lee on board half a year later or something.

79
00:05:08,418 --> 00:05:08,598
Yeah.

80
00:05:09,798 --> 00:05:10,659
Yeah, it was about that.

81
00:05:10,799 --> 00:05:12,099
I remember it quite well because I'm a...

82
00:05:12,664 --> 00:05:16,787
I was still working at IO at the time, I was the lead load designer for Hitman Season 1.

83
00:05:18,468 --> 00:05:21,810
David gave me a call, he was like, Lee, do you want to meet up in a bar in Copenhagen?

84
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:24,432
I've got something to show you, see if you'd be interested.

85
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:25,893
So I thought, yeah, okay.

86
00:05:26,073 --> 00:05:31,337
So we went down to the bar and we had a beer, and David had this iPad with him with some

87
00:05:31,377 --> 00:05:34,799
videos on showing the original prototype for the game.

88
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:40,883
Looks a little bit different from what you see now, but mechanically quite similar.

89
00:05:42,358 --> 00:05:44,099
and he just said to me, Lee, do you want to build this?

90
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,201
I'm putting a team together to build it.

91
00:05:47,242 --> 00:05:48,723
So, I went to the bathroom,

92
00:05:49,444 --> 00:05:50,685
I just stood there and looked in the mirror

93
00:05:50,785 --> 00:05:52,747
and I thought, that looks like a lot of fun.

94
00:05:53,908 --> 00:05:54,989
So I just came back out

95
00:05:55,049 --> 00:05:56,170
and just slapped my hands together

96
00:05:56,290 --> 00:05:57,931
and said, yes, let's do this.

97
00:05:58,952 --> 00:05:59,993
Yeah, he's...

98
00:06:00,554 --> 00:06:01,615
he makes quick decisions.

99
00:06:03,136 --> 00:06:04,597
And I think the original pitch

100
00:06:04,657 --> 00:06:05,618
was something like,

101
00:06:06,159 --> 00:06:07,200
well, I grew up with this,

102
00:06:08,301 --> 00:06:08,581
I'm gonna...

103
00:06:09,113 --> 00:06:14,594
and then I wanted to feel like when I was playing in the woods when I was a kid

104
00:06:14,614 --> 00:06:20,635
I was coming across old abandoned houses and that was kind of the direction

105
00:06:20,835 --> 00:06:22,256
and then let's go from there

106
00:06:22,836 --> 00:06:24,756
to figure out something else

107
00:06:32,442 --> 00:06:40,305
Oh, dang it. Unfortunately, chat's having a harder time hearing you guys, which is something I still don't fully...

108
00:06:40,325 --> 00:06:42,686
Is it the mic or the stream?

109
00:06:44,007 --> 00:06:48,149
Uh, it's a little bit... It's... Because I can hear you all just fine.

110
00:06:48,169 --> 00:06:53,411
Unfortunately, we've been having a thing where sometimes the Skype audio is not talking...

111
00:06:53,551 --> 00:06:54,912
coming through on XSplit very well.

112
00:06:55,912 --> 00:06:56,573
So...

113
00:06:56,593 --> 00:06:59,774
Trying to figure out if I can change anything over here.

114
00:07:00,154 --> 00:07:01,155
Uh, could you talk for me real quick?

115
00:07:03,432 --> 00:07:03,912
Sorry to interrupt.

116
00:07:03,932 --> 00:07:05,972
Yeah, so let's continue where we were then.

117
00:07:06,232 --> 00:07:10,914
Yeah, I guess I'll just ask the question, you guys can rattle while I poke buttons.

118
00:07:11,854 --> 00:07:17,876
Really quick, so were you as a kid, David, did you kind of like play the tabletop RPG

119
00:07:17,996 --> 00:07:20,757
and then like kind of go out in the woods and just kind of imagine yourself on these

120
00:07:20,797 --> 00:07:23,177
adventures just like the characters are right now?

121
00:07:23,257 --> 00:07:26,338
That's kind of a personal question, but it's kind of fascinating.

122
00:07:26,398 --> 00:07:30,160
That's okay, because that's more or less it, because I played this...

123
00:07:31,357 --> 00:07:35,439
The pen and paper roleplaying game came out in 82 or 83 or something.

124
00:07:35,459 --> 00:07:37,101
I didn't play it then, I'm not that old.

125
00:07:38,141 --> 00:07:43,205
But I played it when I was 10 or 11 or something the first time, so it was probably around

126
00:07:43,265 --> 00:07:47,348
the same time I would be imagining things while playing in the woods.

127
00:07:49,489 --> 00:07:55,654
So yeah, it was a big part of my childhood, which was just a good starting point to get

128
00:07:55,694 --> 00:07:56,274
going with it.

129
00:07:59,713 --> 00:08:01,534
How did you... I mean, it's kind of like...

130
00:08:01,735 --> 00:08:05,558
If tabletop RPGs are sort of, you know, nice because you can do anything,

131
00:08:06,118 --> 00:08:08,160
and obviously you had XCOM in your head as a format,

132
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:10,281
but how did you sort of move it from...

133
00:08:11,803 --> 00:08:15,566
You had those two... You had XCOM and you had this childhood experience,

134
00:08:15,586 --> 00:08:18,688
and how did you sort of move it into what we're looking at right now?

135
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:24,673
Well, I built most of the game world.

136
00:08:24,693 --> 00:08:25,694
How did it start?

137
00:08:26,986 --> 00:08:31,147
I didn't have that much experience with Mutant before I started on the project because most

138
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:36,629
of the Mutant roleplaying games were all in Swedish since the 80s and it's only recently

139
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:40,230
it had been translated into English for Mutant Year Zero.

140
00:08:41,171 --> 00:08:45,592
So I sat down with all the material that I could get hold of, the books, the expansion

141
00:08:45,632 --> 00:08:50,394
books, all the stuff available in English and just went through it all with a fine tooth

142
00:08:50,414 --> 00:08:56,116
comb and then tried to craft the world that you see now based on

143
00:08:56,828 --> 00:09:00,990
The images I was getting in my head as I was reading the books and as I was imagining how

144
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:08,113
these sessions play out and the kind of feel and the dark humor, but the touch of seriousness

145
00:09:08,133 --> 00:09:08,873
to everything.

146
00:09:08,893 --> 00:09:12,315
Yeah, that was kind of on the world plane.

147
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:16,536
And that was really nice, that was something me and Keller said early on, Keller was really

148
00:09:17,096 --> 00:09:22,919
worried that it would become too Swedish, the game, if we made it with all our backgrounds.

149
00:09:24,186 --> 00:09:29,268
So it was great to have somebody from the outside come in and kind of rediscover it, right?

150
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,790
And then when it came to the gameplay, I think we quite early, we said,

151
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:37,611
we're going to skip the parts that the pen and paper will do really well.

152
00:09:39,032 --> 00:09:42,953
The social interactions and all the stuff you get from the pen and paper.

153
00:09:43,514 --> 00:09:46,235
We could never do that as well in a game.

154
00:09:47,055 --> 00:09:53,898
So, so we figured we'll focus on the combat and see if we can tell some sort of story in a different fashion.

155
00:09:54,710 --> 00:09:56,730
in this game world.

156
00:10:23,376 --> 00:10:37,479
What was the design decision, the thinking behind that, having a game, implementing that in the game, as opposed to sort of doing the, you know, a fixed party of characters, something more like Pillars of Eternity, which is another tabletop inspired like RPG like this?

157
00:10:39,999 --> 00:10:52,982
Well, when we first started out the original prototypes, we did have a limited amount of characters in the arc and a very XCOM style gameplay where it was more about recruit management.

158
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:58,795
Things like that, but the problem is as the characters that we have started to evolve

159
00:10:59,255 --> 00:11:04,196
and as the story of the game evolved, it would get into the point where especially Bormin

160
00:11:04,237 --> 00:11:09,898
and Dux and some of the other guys had such strong personalities and such strong visual

161
00:11:09,978 --> 00:11:15,540
identity that we were struggling with the idea of having four Bormins on the battlefield

162
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:16,680
and things like that.

163
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:20,601
It wasn't really working anymore, so we had this conflict of the gameplay was starting

164
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:21,801
to conflict with the game's...

165
00:11:23,218 --> 00:11:24,680
narrative and identity a little bit.

166
00:11:25,902 --> 00:11:32,351
So we decided, we took the call to basically concentrate on the characters so the characters

167
00:11:32,371 --> 00:11:36,877
don't become just blank recruits and they have their own identities, they have their

168
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:39,641
own personalities and really hammer on that side instead.

169
00:11:42,561 --> 00:11:43,141
Right on, that's...

170
00:11:43,201 --> 00:11:47,764
Yeah, and I guess we can answer the first question now as well, right?

171
00:11:47,944 --> 00:11:49,104
Yeah, are we allowed to say how many?

172
00:11:49,324 --> 00:11:50,105
I'm not sure.

173
00:11:50,565 --> 00:11:52,146
Are we?

174
00:11:52,686 --> 00:11:54,707
Well, you start off with Bowman and Dux.

175
00:11:55,327 --> 00:11:57,228
All we can say is that you start off with Bowman and Dux,

176
00:11:58,269 --> 00:12:01,771
and as you explore the zone, you will find some other mules who can join your party.

177
00:12:02,731 --> 00:12:06,333
Yeah, we're not certain we need to make a call to marketing.

178
00:12:07,073 --> 00:12:11,455
We're not certain if we're allowed to say how many will be in the initial game.

179
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:18,603
But the plan is to add characters to this further down the line, for sure.

180
00:12:19,503 --> 00:12:19,903
Yeah.

181
00:12:19,943 --> 00:12:20,723
Keep this world.

182
00:12:21,084 --> 00:12:29,087
Yeah, Lee and David, since you came from I.O., I guess you have experience not just making

183
00:12:29,107 --> 00:12:35,810
a stealth slash tactical game, it's also a game that you're used to making as a live game.

184
00:12:38,031 --> 00:12:41,433
What do you think were some of the changes that you sort of thought about in your game dev process

185
00:12:41,453 --> 00:12:45,596
for making sure that you could update this game down the line and sort of make it,

186
00:12:45,836 --> 00:12:47,477
not necessarily, you know, like fully live,

187
00:12:48,318 --> 00:12:51,720
but more live than I think RPG developers were used to in the past?

188
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:54,462
I think a lot of players are expecting more frequent updates these days.

189
00:12:57,263 --> 00:12:59,725
Yeah, we should say we didn't.

190
00:13:00,445 --> 00:13:00,545
Oh.

191
00:13:00,585 --> 00:13:01,846
To be completely honest.

192
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,088
We made sure that we...

193
00:13:05,195 --> 00:13:08,515
We didn't go out of our bounds early on.

194
00:13:08,535 --> 00:13:11,456
We were looking at things like generating a huge world,

195
00:13:11,516 --> 00:13:12,756
making it streaming.

196
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,457
And we realized that it would probably not

197
00:13:16,777 --> 00:13:21,678
be the greatest use of our time in the end.

198
00:13:21,978 --> 00:13:24,098
We would rather make sure that the combat is fun

199
00:13:24,138 --> 00:13:25,018
and the stealth works.

200
00:13:25,098 --> 00:13:29,219
So we decided to split it up into more of zones, a map,

201
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:31,460
where you go exploring and you switch out

202
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,920
of real time and tactical, as you're seeing on screen.

203
00:13:35,793 --> 00:13:39,015
And then that's one kind of contained area with one story.

204
00:13:39,035 --> 00:13:43,739
That way, it makes it easier for us to expand on this further down the line

205
00:13:43,779 --> 00:13:50,544
without having to maybe, you know, think about too many other things that will interlock with it,

206
00:13:50,944 --> 00:13:54,546
so to speak, if we were to open an area in an open world or anything like that.

207
00:13:55,347 --> 00:13:58,429
So that was one of the things, I guess.

208
00:13:58,569 --> 00:14:01,651
Yeah, I think for me as well, when we were experimenting early in the project,

209
00:14:03,673 --> 00:14:08,195
We came to the conclusion quite quickly that randomly generating maps are...

210
00:14:08,776 --> 00:14:12,538
You can get a lot of content if you randomly generate maps, you can get almost unlimited content.

211
00:14:13,078 --> 00:14:15,019
But the problem is, is it quality content?

212
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:21,583
Because if you handcraft a map, you can go so much deeper with the environmental storytelling,

213
00:14:21,603 --> 00:14:26,486
with the little touches in the game world, the visual side of it, the lighting, the effects.

214
00:14:27,226 --> 00:14:32,369
You can get such a higher quality level from the maps, rather than just randomly generating.

215
00:14:34,365 --> 00:14:34,766
Right on.

216
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:36,946
Um, uh, what else?

217
00:14:37,147 --> 00:14:42,609
Actually, I'm sure there are things we thought about that, uh, can't come up

218
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:42,989
with now.

219
00:14:43,970 --> 00:14:44,410
Oh, it's fine.

220
00:14:44,430 --> 00:14:47,951
We'll we'll, like when it comes to the character systems and spawners and

221
00:14:48,011 --> 00:14:48,472
things, right?

222
00:14:48,992 --> 00:14:49,292
Yeah.

223
00:14:50,432 --> 00:14:53,734
What, um, what engine, what, uh, I'm curious what, what, what engine is this

224
00:14:53,754 --> 00:14:57,075
game running in and sort of how long does it take to take an interesting idea for

225
00:14:57,095 --> 00:15:00,417
whether it's an area or a story beat and how long does it take to implement it?

226
00:15:00,777 --> 00:15:01,297
Content wise.

227
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,287
So it's Unreal 4.

228
00:15:05,807 --> 00:15:07,027
And oof.

229
00:15:08,007 --> 00:15:13,268
I think for maps, because we modulize as much as possible

230
00:15:14,469 --> 00:15:18,329
in the game's assets, I can get a map open, not finished,

231
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:20,670
but just up and running so that we can play it

232
00:15:21,150 --> 00:15:21,930
within about a week.

233
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:28,291
Yeah, and then once the map is up and running,

234
00:15:28,431 --> 00:15:31,431
then we iterate very heavily on the layout

235
00:15:31,511 --> 00:15:31,892
and on the...

236
00:15:32,648 --> 00:15:35,350
had the gameplay feel for a few weeks.

237
00:15:35,550 --> 00:15:37,772
And then after that, it goes into what we call layering.

238
00:15:38,973 --> 00:15:39,993
We layer on the graphics.

239
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:42,575
And then that just continues and continues until it's

240
00:15:43,135 --> 00:15:45,737
to this kind of quality that you see now.

241
00:15:45,777 --> 00:15:48,218
Yeah, it's been rather quick, the last few ones.

242
00:15:48,298 --> 00:15:50,180
But it's always a hard question, right?

243
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:52,561
Where we'll almost have to do a postmortem,

244
00:15:53,722 --> 00:15:56,564
look at a few submits to time those last levels.

245
00:15:58,305 --> 00:15:59,826
Because of course, it's gotten quicker.

246
00:16:01,451 --> 00:16:07,405
But some of them have been iterated for a long time to make sure that any changes to

247
00:16:07,465 --> 00:16:11,054
gameplay has to be reflected in level design, for instance.

248
00:16:12,424 --> 00:16:16,025
What do you think changed from your team's experience level?

249
00:16:16,045 --> 00:16:19,506
Because obviously, like you said, you're a small team and it's not like you can throw...

250
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:26,288
It's not Ubisoft where you can throw a thousand Ubisofts at it to fix any given problem.

251
00:16:26,308 --> 00:16:32,970
What do you think your team learned from those first levels to the later levels that sped up your process?

252
00:16:37,051 --> 00:16:39,132
Yeah, that's hard to...

253
00:16:40,232 --> 00:16:40,752
I would say...

254
00:16:41,552 --> 00:16:49,437
Basically, the layout for tactical games was surprisingly took a long time to nail.

255
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:54,940
Like cover positions and high ground positions and especially when you got the mechanical side

256
00:16:54,980 --> 00:17:01,084
of the game is being developed at the same time. So stealth and what numbers are involved in stealth

257
00:17:01,204 --> 00:17:05,426
and then you know how the distance for weapons firing and things like this.

258
00:17:05,446 --> 00:17:07,648
Yeah I remember I remember quite early going

259
00:17:08,637 --> 00:17:12,540
I didn't think, because as you said, we've made stealth games, but we've never made an XCOM.

260
00:17:13,541 --> 00:17:19,366
So that was one of the things I remember Lee saying, it wasn't early, but maybe half a year into it,

261
00:17:19,566 --> 00:17:26,191
where you realize that the combat, the maps, the turn-based takes, it needs quite a bit of space.

262
00:17:26,792 --> 00:17:29,874
Way more than we actually were planning for initially.

263
00:17:29,914 --> 00:17:34,037
So our first couple of maps, once we started putting enough into them, became too cramped.

264
00:17:34,257 --> 00:17:36,459
Yeah, really cramped and claustrophobic feeling.

265
00:17:38,663 --> 00:17:43,585
So we learned what a small map is and what a large map is.

266
00:17:45,906 --> 00:17:50,187
And then we quite early, so it's completely tile-based, right?

267
00:17:50,207 --> 00:17:53,788
So we made sure that everything worked within that system.

268
00:17:54,968 --> 00:17:58,069
And we were actually kind of generating ground

269
00:17:58,129 --> 00:17:59,650
and everything around it for a while.

270
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:04,831
And, well, we learned that that's, like Lee said,

271
00:18:04,871 --> 00:18:07,772
that we can't create the quality with that type of system.

272
00:18:08,370 --> 00:18:11,932
But if I should say one thing for the developers out there,

273
00:18:12,272 --> 00:18:15,413
Calenmi made a choice early on, if you want to make an XCOM clone,

274
00:18:15,933 --> 00:18:18,875
to put the data on the edges rather than on the grid points.

275
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:19,995
Do not do that.

276
00:18:21,716 --> 00:18:24,137
That's come back to haunt us quite a bit.

277
00:18:24,717 --> 00:18:25,677
It complicates things.

278
00:18:26,257 --> 00:18:28,118
When you can come, like you can have a...

279
00:18:28,758 --> 00:18:30,559
So when you have corners, for instance, right?

280
00:18:31,839 --> 00:18:33,620
That's a complicated setup all of a sudden,

281
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,501
where if you just had a specific...

282
00:18:35,913 --> 00:18:42,120
Corner tile like metadata that said it was a corner you could treat it as such right away now. We were a little bit too

283
00:18:43,081 --> 00:18:46,325
Free with what we could do so you can then you can make you know t-junction

284
00:18:46,365 --> 00:18:51,131
Setups and all that because we were putting everything on our edges, so I wouldn't do that again

285
00:18:53,427 --> 00:18:59,572
Callie, I want to give you some time to have some fun here.

286
00:19:00,333 --> 00:19:05,437
Callie, I'm curious, this is a small team, this is a small company, and I think something

287
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:08,980
that I didn't understand until I started talking to game developers was that...

288
00:19:10,901 --> 00:19:22,265
Everything you look at in a game takes time to make and what we're looking at, you know, just this one house and layout area we're looking at right now is way more time than I could have ever imagined, I'd say three or four years ago.

289
00:19:23,345 --> 00:19:34,009
What do you think helps you and your colleagues out being able to make assets for a handcrafted level, like handcrafted levels as opposed to procedural levels?

290
00:19:35,029 --> 00:19:38,971
How are you able to do it efficiently and make things so that a small team could manage it?

291
00:19:42,076 --> 00:19:52,181
It's probably a combination of Unreal being pretty flexible and also, I mean we have been

292
00:19:52,281 --> 00:19:54,302
using outsourcing quite a lot.

293
00:19:55,823 --> 00:20:01,086
One of our first recruits was actually an outsourcing manager and artist.

294
00:20:01,946 --> 00:20:05,608
So yeah.

295
00:20:08,679 --> 00:20:13,880
I believe that was key to get some help as a small studio, so we knew we could get that

296
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:14,060
help.

297
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:18,841
But then in the end, when it comes to the characters and stuff, I mean, a little bit

298
00:20:18,861 --> 00:20:20,562
has been outsourced, but mostly done in-house.

299
00:20:21,002 --> 00:20:26,103
When it comes to the levels, it has been done in-house.

300
00:20:26,883 --> 00:20:32,285
Basically everything, only props, has been outsourced, I guess.

301
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:38,366
I think one thing technically as well that helped a little bit is that we didn't go in

302
00:20:38,426 --> 00:20:41,067
any baked lighting for the games.

303
00:20:41,087 --> 00:20:45,770
It was mostly outdoors, it wouldn't really bring up the fidelity maybe that much anyway,

304
00:20:46,090 --> 00:20:51,032
but it was a choice early on mostly actually from a production standpoint because, you

305
00:20:51,052 --> 00:20:55,734
know, relighting levels whenever we do something would have been too much for us.

306
00:21:00,565 --> 00:21:02,447
It's a case of making smart decisions as well.

307
00:21:02,487 --> 00:21:05,870
It's like looking at your team and who you have on the team and what they're strong in.

308
00:21:07,191 --> 00:21:11,714
For the main story beats, we use these 2D cutscenes.

309
00:21:12,855 --> 00:21:17,799
It's because we have a member of the team who is an amazing 2D artist.

310
00:21:18,219 --> 00:21:20,261
He's actually a traditional painter.

311
00:21:21,822 --> 00:21:26,165
So it's like, OK, well, we have someone who is crazy good at 2D art, so we should use that.

312
00:21:28,342 --> 00:21:30,264
Yeah, exactly. Leverage what you've got.

313
00:21:30,304 --> 00:21:34,887
Yeah, leverage your streams.

314
00:21:34,967 --> 00:21:38,690
Which artist is that, by the way? We should credit them for the great art we're looking at right now.

315
00:21:40,351 --> 00:21:42,953
Oscar. Oscar Bodine.

316
00:21:43,233 --> 00:21:43,634
Yeah.

317
00:21:44,014 --> 00:21:46,776
Nice. Oscar did a good job on these, I think.

318
00:21:49,579 --> 00:21:50,840
What made you all make...

319
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,844
I played another stealth tactical game earlier this year called Phantom Doctrine.

320
00:21:55,864 --> 00:21:58,306
It was really good. I liked it a lot.

321
00:21:59,207 --> 00:22:05,152
But it could be kind of a slower game because even though it was a stealth game that also had XCOM combat...

322
00:22:07,613 --> 00:22:12,193
They did a turn-based stealth thing, which was fun, but also, like I said, it took a while.

323
00:22:14,234 --> 00:22:17,794
It seems like you guys have more experience with making stealth games than making XCOM games,

324
00:22:18,735 --> 00:22:22,275
but what was your sort of guiding philosophy for doing stealth in this kind of setting?

325
00:22:22,895 --> 00:22:26,276
And knowing that players would probably want to barge into combat anyway,

326
00:22:27,876 --> 00:22:33,317
given the, you know, it's an XCOM game, you move units and you shoot things.

327
00:22:35,576 --> 00:22:45,459
Yeah, quite early on from almost day one we made the decision that we wanted to keep the stealth aspect as simple as we possibly could.

328
00:22:46,779 --> 00:22:55,962
A reason for that was we didn't want the players spending any more time there than we needed to kind of tell the story and let you explore the world.

329
00:22:56,062 --> 00:23:04,464
Because what we wanted you to do was to do the stealth moments or you know set up for combat while you're in real time so we could speed it up a little bit.

330
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:07,783
But if we started adding too much functionality to that,

331
00:23:08,143 --> 00:23:09,663
it would slow it down again, right?

332
00:23:09,743 --> 00:23:11,484
So we made a decision very early on

333
00:23:11,504 --> 00:23:14,585
that we wanted to keep the amount of game mechanics

334
00:23:14,625 --> 00:23:16,825
that you can utilize in the real time to a minimum

335
00:23:17,325 --> 00:23:18,746
and keep it very, very simple.

336
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:22,967
So that's shown, for instance, in the attention circles

337
00:23:23,007 --> 00:23:24,887
that we use rather than any vision cones

338
00:23:24,927 --> 00:23:25,607
or anything like that.

339
00:23:25,627 --> 00:23:28,448
We didn't want people trying to sneak on a corner too much

340
00:23:28,568 --> 00:23:29,908
and spend too much time doing that.

341
00:23:30,909 --> 00:23:34,631
Yeah, because I assume the vision circles make it easier to let the player know,

342
00:23:34,671 --> 00:23:37,372
hey, this is where they notice you and this is where they don't,

343
00:23:37,412 --> 00:23:41,234
as opposed to like nitty-gritty Hitman style trying to, you know,

344
00:23:41,815 --> 00:23:44,996
keep at the corner of an NPC's vision or something.

345
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,457
Yeah, exactly. That was the choice.

346
00:23:47,517 --> 00:23:49,879
It was either that or, you know, giving them...

347
00:23:50,179 --> 00:23:52,920
Whenever you get discovered, you get a little bit of leeway time.

348
00:23:53,642 --> 00:23:55,723
As we would have done in Hitman, for instance.

349
00:23:56,043 --> 00:23:58,765
You know, the guy would come over and investigate,

350
00:23:58,845 --> 00:24:00,246
but that gave us other problems, right?

351
00:24:00,706 --> 00:24:02,087
For balancing the game.

352
00:24:02,827 --> 00:24:04,748
So that was quite early a decision.

353
00:24:05,489 --> 00:24:05,909
Yeah.

354
00:24:06,229 --> 00:24:12,073
That we don't put anything extra that we didn't need into the real time.

355
00:24:12,153 --> 00:24:14,374
And as you can see, the attention circles here now are like,

356
00:24:14,514 --> 00:24:17,556
as long as you stay out of them, you have the advantage, right?

357
00:24:17,977 --> 00:24:18,297
Yeah.

358
00:24:18,377 --> 00:24:20,098
And that communicates very, very clearly.

359
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:25,268
I really like the little red highlights that come up as you get close to them.

360
00:24:25,388 --> 00:24:29,970
It's almost like a stove that's too warm.

361
00:24:29,990 --> 00:24:38,794
Yeah, I think the idea was that this should be a tense moment, but you shouldn't feel stressed about it, so to speak.

362
00:24:38,934 --> 00:24:45,857
You should feel that you have the time to check out the guy coming in on a patrol here and see what's behind him, etc.

363
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:47,818
Before setting up and then...

364
00:24:48,990 --> 00:24:53,154
If it were vision cone based for instance, that vision cone might just BAM come all of

365
00:24:53,194 --> 00:24:57,938
a sudden as he steps in behind, from behind a building or a car or something, right?

366
00:24:57,958 --> 00:25:02,943
We didn't want to make it too skill based basically.

367
00:25:03,684 --> 00:25:08,268
When you sneak around it should be more about making a tactical decision rather than being

368
00:25:08,308 --> 00:25:11,010
stressed and making quick decisions.

369
00:25:11,791 --> 00:25:14,874
For instance, you should have climbed the roof of the petrol station here.

370
00:25:15,975 --> 00:25:16,815
Oh, well, you know.

371
00:25:44,039 --> 00:25:45,860
Yeah, that's what's happening.

372
00:25:45,880 --> 00:25:48,761
If we're watching the footage right now, that's actually what's happening.

373
00:25:48,781 --> 00:25:56,165
Like, I was surprised to discover this, that you could just sort of sneak your characters around and pick off the isolated enemies.

374
00:25:56,425 --> 00:25:57,405
That's really nifty.

375
00:25:57,425 --> 00:26:01,467
Like, that's something XCOM doesn't have, because once combat starts in XCOM, combat starts.

376
00:26:01,487 --> 00:26:06,310
Like, there's no more, you know, sneaking around a level.

377
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:14,673
Is there anything in particular you had to set up to make sure that players could figure out that they could do this kind of thing?

378
00:26:14,693 --> 00:26:18,354
So that they didn't just barge into combat every time?

379
00:26:18,374 --> 00:26:29,718
I mean, the very start of the game that you're just seeing now is very much designed to be a general introduction to stuff.

380
00:26:29,758 --> 00:26:35,740
So some extremely obvious patrols of guys with low health walking around on their own.

381
00:26:36,875 --> 00:26:41,777
It's not very taxing, it's not very challenging, and the characters when they talk, they're

382
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:46,779
heavily hinting at least two or three times that we should investigate who's here and

383
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:49,520
we should sneak around first.

384
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:55,342
So I would say the first 20 minutes of the game is gently kind of pushing the player

385
00:26:56,142 --> 00:27:00,544
into this kind of play style rather than us hitting them with a hammer.

386
00:27:01,084 --> 00:27:02,505
If that makes sense.

387
00:27:03,685 --> 00:27:05,646
When was it useful to hit players with a hammer though?

388
00:27:08,141 --> 00:27:10,003
Well that would be the tutorial screen I guess.

389
00:27:10,323 --> 00:27:15,086
Actually it is a good one because we had in user research about a month ago or something

390
00:27:15,106 --> 00:27:20,450
it was one of the things that we probably didn't communicate enough.

391
00:27:20,590 --> 00:27:25,794
We have added some tutorial messages around this because if you don't figure it out rather

392
00:27:25,854 --> 00:27:31,278
quickly the levels can become quite hard later down the line because we really wanted you

393
00:27:31,378 --> 00:27:32,979
to scout out these positions.

394
00:27:32,999 --> 00:27:34,360
You don't always have to pick up.

395
00:27:34,958 --> 00:27:37,639
everybody around the map, but at least figure out that they're there.

396
00:27:37,659 --> 00:27:43,580
Or when more advanced units step into the field that can help other units and such,

397
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:47,621
it's very important that you know about these units or they will surprise you.

398
00:27:49,342 --> 00:27:53,903
Yeah, it was also important that the stealth doesn't become boring in the game.

399
00:27:54,063 --> 00:27:55,643
Because this pattern that we are doing now,

400
00:27:56,663 --> 00:27:59,024
you repeat that too much, it will start becoming stale.

401
00:28:00,835 --> 00:28:05,357
when the game is balancing, the enemies that get harder, the further into the zone you'll get

402
00:28:05,937 --> 00:28:10,139
and the enemy's health will slowly start to track ahead of your stealth weapons

403
00:28:11,179 --> 00:28:16,901
so at some point in the game you're going to start having to use multiple characters with stealth weapons to kill an enemy

404
00:28:17,461 --> 00:28:22,863
or make use of your mutations that allow you to do double damage or crit damage and stuff like that

405
00:28:23,483 --> 00:28:24,583
to be able to pull off a stealth kill

406
00:28:28,779 --> 00:28:33,463
Now you're out of combat, but of course we have a critical hit and a regular one, and that's the balance you were talking about.

407
00:28:33,623 --> 00:28:35,964
It comes kind of in layers, that balance, it's quite nice.

408
00:28:36,425 --> 00:28:47,032
Where, yeah, during the mid-game you have to start doing critical hits with your silent weapons in order to take these straggling characters out, or these outliers, right?

409
00:28:47,452 --> 00:28:49,994
So it becomes a little bit deeper to do it, which is quite nice.

410
00:28:50,034 --> 00:28:57,420
And then towards the end, yeah, you'll have to use basically all the tricks in the book if you want to take anybody out on the outskirts.

411
00:28:58,054 --> 00:29:20,681
Right on. That's actually kind of, that's interesting in that I've been playing a lot of Assassin's Creed Odyssey and just thinking about, I've been thinking about how like familiar routine I fell into with that game as far as, I can sort of feel where the game wants me to improvise and you know just sort of roll with it if things escalate and go badly, but if you're very careful you can make a very, you know, repetitive

412
00:29:21,622 --> 00:29:27,548
I'm going to move on to another question, which is, XCOM is sort of infamous in some ways for how it communicates hit percentages.

413
00:29:38,761 --> 00:29:43,643
It's kind of, I think it's considered a positive element in some respects because players don't

414
00:29:43,683 --> 00:29:46,824
seem to be averse to the idea of missing a 90% shot.

415
00:29:47,204 --> 00:29:50,325
You know, at close range, like you stand there and fire the big gun and the alien doesn't

416
00:29:50,365 --> 00:29:50,745
get hit.

417
00:29:51,505 --> 00:29:53,446
I noticed that hit percentages were a thing in this game.

418
00:29:53,806 --> 00:29:56,707
What did you learn about communicating those values to players?

419
00:29:56,987 --> 00:30:01,708
And I know there's some lies, like XCOM is lying to you sometimes about percentages and

420
00:30:01,728 --> 00:30:04,129
a lot of tactical games will actually do that to you.

421
00:30:04,929 --> 00:30:07,570
What did you learn about that from your own perspective?

422
00:30:08,210 --> 00:30:09,551
How did that affect your design decisions?

423
00:30:11,291 --> 00:30:14,853
Well, first of all, of course, we're also cheating behind the scenes

424
00:30:14,933 --> 00:30:20,475
because people do not understand percentages very well.

425
00:30:20,515 --> 00:30:23,536
So a 75% shot here is a bit higher, right?

426
00:30:23,736 --> 00:30:23,976
Yeah.

427
00:30:24,076 --> 00:30:27,737
And we'll also do a few tricks on the AI side

428
00:30:27,797 --> 00:30:31,679
where if they hit you, they'll actually have less chance next time and such

429
00:30:31,959 --> 00:30:33,900
so that you don't get into these streaks of the...

430
00:30:34,353 --> 00:30:37,295
The enemy feeling super powerful just because they got a lucky run.

431
00:30:38,735 --> 00:30:44,837
You need to do a couple of these things, specifically around 50%, right?

432
00:30:45,338 --> 00:30:48,199
I think 25-50% is where people...

433
00:30:48,919 --> 00:30:50,620
You shouldn't be taking those shots, really.

434
00:30:51,140 --> 00:30:53,761
You shouldn't be taking 25% shots in an XCOM game.

435
00:30:54,261 --> 00:30:57,042
People expect 4-25% shots to be a hit.

436
00:30:58,242 --> 00:31:02,304
So one way of doing that then, of course, is to add a bit when you miss, for instance.

437
00:31:03,770 --> 00:31:06,230
So we have a few of those tricks going on behind the scenes.

438
00:31:08,051 --> 00:31:11,812
And I think it doesn't deter anything from the game.

439
00:31:12,832 --> 00:31:15,652
We added more along the line where we felt it was needed.

440
00:31:16,513 --> 00:31:20,674
It's better that the game feels fair than that it is fair.

441
00:31:20,914 --> 00:31:21,114
Right.

442
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:24,094
That's actually the hardest thing to do in these games is to make them feel fair.

443
00:31:24,894 --> 00:31:27,755
Yeah, and Lee was also very early on with the percentages.

444
00:31:30,299 --> 00:31:33,501
He wanted it to be... we looked at Mario Rabbids vs Rabbids, I think?

445
00:31:33,741 --> 00:31:34,982
Yeah, I think they do 150.

446
00:31:35,043 --> 00:31:36,444
Yeah, they're...

447
00:31:36,584 --> 00:31:38,605
They're more extreme than we are.

448
00:31:38,706 --> 00:31:40,687
Yeah, but you...

449
00:31:41,488 --> 00:31:42,929
We went with the system in between.

450
00:31:43,269 --> 00:31:47,393
Yeah, we went for like an in-between system, where we round the numbers up to the nearest 25%.

451
00:31:48,494 --> 00:31:48,914
I think it is.

452
00:31:49,434 --> 00:31:49,615
Yeah.

453
00:31:50,575 --> 00:31:52,297
Because it just feels...

454
00:31:53,938 --> 00:31:54,679
a bit more...

455
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:58,582
For me personally, when I'm playing, it just feels a bit more easier to predict what's going to happen.

456
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:08,051
a 75% is not, to me it feels not guaranteed, it's still a bit of a gamble.

457
00:32:08,111 --> 00:32:10,793
50% feels like, we know what a 50-50 is, it's a complete gamble.

458
00:32:11,553 --> 00:32:14,696
If you're going to hit 25, that just feels like it's going to miss.

459
00:32:16,357 --> 00:32:24,162
Whereas if I'm playing and I'm getting an 87% chance to hit, that's a little bit more difficult for me to get a feel for what that number means to me.

460
00:32:25,503 --> 00:32:26,263
I'm taking my shot.

461
00:32:26,721 --> 00:32:30,443
How do you, um, uh, so it's kind of interesting that there's almost like there's two calculations

462
00:32:30,483 --> 00:32:31,043
going on there.

463
00:32:31,063 --> 00:32:35,165
There's the first calculation that I assume just checks, you know, it checks enemy level,

464
00:32:35,225 --> 00:32:37,906
it checks your player's level, it checks the player's gear.

465
00:32:38,706 --> 00:32:40,867
Then there's a rounded number that's presented to the player.

466
00:32:41,127 --> 00:32:49,011
Um, uh, what, uh, what internally, uh, are you, do you think makes for like, like from

467
00:32:49,091 --> 00:32:49,111
a...

468
00:32:49,931 --> 00:32:57,817
I guess thinking about making those formulas, what do you think makes a good version of those formulas from the dev side before it's presented to the player?

469
00:33:00,099 --> 00:33:13,568
Oh, that's a good question. But I think rounding was a little bit wrong, because what we did is basically we said that all your bonuses are on like a 25%, so a low cover will give you 25%, while a high cover will give you 50, right?

470
00:33:13,588 --> 00:33:13,668
Yeah.

471
00:33:13,688 --> 00:33:13,809
Yeah.

472
00:33:19,259 --> 00:33:20,940
instead of going with 10% cent.

473
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,241
or, you know, some certain angle.

474
00:33:22,541 --> 00:33:26,423
Trying to be a little bit more binary so that players will learn that,

475
00:33:26,523 --> 00:33:28,364
okay, I'm gonna take 75% shots.

476
00:33:28,484 --> 00:33:31,225
Or try to get 100 because in our game, it's quite easy to get 100.

477
00:33:31,866 --> 00:33:34,407
As long as you flank an enemy, you will most likely be getting it.

478
00:33:34,447 --> 00:33:35,848
We do have range in there.

479
00:33:37,188 --> 00:33:39,369
But that's what we wanted.

480
00:33:39,409 --> 00:33:42,931
We wanted players to figure out how to get 75 or 100 shots every time right.

481
00:33:42,951 --> 00:33:43,131
MmmmHmm.

482
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:53,478
I'm not sure if this is a good idea, but I'm going to try to be pretty harsh on the other end.

483
00:33:54,238 --> 00:33:57,762
I'd rather give you 0% than 5% because we don't want you taking 5% shots anyway.

484
00:33:58,523 --> 00:34:01,045
It was right to try and make the game feel a lot more fair.

485
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:07,832
We want to reward players for doing good tactical moves a lot more than other tactical games will do.

486
00:34:11,310 --> 00:34:18,233
If I'm flanking someone and I only get a 82% chance to hit and I miss, it doesn't feel

487
00:34:18,253 --> 00:34:21,835
like I'm being rewarded for doing some good tactical play.

488
00:34:22,156 --> 00:34:28,499
So in our game if you do a good tactical play and good positioning, which the stealth is

489
00:34:29,059 --> 00:34:32,781
directly feeding into, then you'll be rewarded pretty highly.

490
00:34:38,359 --> 00:34:43,843
solved completely here, which is teaching players what flanking means.

491
00:34:44,304 --> 00:34:48,327
Because it's the same rules as XCOM uses, which basically means you need to be on the same,

492
00:34:49,208 --> 00:34:56,254
like, behind the grid point that the cover is on. But since we have quite lush environments

493
00:34:56,294 --> 00:35:00,397
that look almost biological at times, it can be really hard to communicate that.

494
00:35:03,638 --> 00:35:07,421
We opted to go for the, let's see if you switch to combat here,

495
00:35:07,781 --> 00:35:13,766
making sure that we show the line of fire and kind of your percentages to all the characters

496
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,109
in a preview from any tile that you want to move to.

497
00:35:19,249 --> 00:35:24,613
And then that way you could kind of explore where you would get the best advantage.

498
00:35:25,174 --> 00:35:30,177
I'm not sure what's in this demo actually, because we've been adding a little bit to that lately.

499
00:35:31,498 --> 00:35:32,899
Well, let's see when you get into combat.

500
00:35:33,645 --> 00:35:36,507
This gets really interesting because I totally thought I was boned here.

501
00:35:36,587 --> 00:35:37,087
But uh...

502
00:35:38,107 --> 00:35:41,429
Now you have this guy behind the house.

503
00:35:42,629 --> 00:35:44,090
And he's a silent weapon, yeah.

504
00:35:44,270 --> 00:35:46,471
Yeah, but that was a tense moment, right?

505
00:35:46,771 --> 00:35:47,071
Yeah.

506
00:35:47,091 --> 00:35:48,632
I've been caught there as well.

507
00:35:49,832 --> 00:35:53,714
I liked how he came to look for me and I was just kind of panicked into a corner.

508
00:35:54,434 --> 00:35:55,955
And I was like, ah, what do I do?

509
00:35:56,035 --> 00:35:57,035
Fire, fire, fire!

510
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:59,737
And it worked out okay.

511
00:36:00,932 --> 00:36:06,419
Yeah, you should be careful there because the boar doesn't have a silent weapon at the moment, right?

512
00:36:06,780 --> 00:36:12,547
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can see I stuck him here to get ready to fight while I move my duck around.

513
00:36:12,567 --> 00:36:13,148
Yep.

514
00:36:15,150 --> 00:36:17,873
I guess that brings us back to the environment a little bit, which is...

515
00:36:20,746 --> 00:36:35,417
What do you think helped you move from the vision of exploring the woods and finding random buildings in the woods to taking those woods and making them locales that could make for these interesting decisions?

516
00:36:37,278 --> 00:36:38,579
It's sort of easy, I think, to...

517
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:40,699
Well, no, nothing in game development is easy.

518
00:36:40,739 --> 00:36:41,279
What am I saying?

519
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:48,202
It is one thing to make a lush rendered scene that's interesting to explore,

520
00:36:48,602 --> 00:36:51,763
and then it's another to say, like, that one bit of cover out there...

521
00:36:52,103 --> 00:36:53,343
You can't see me pointing. What am I doing?

522
00:36:53,383 --> 00:36:55,564
That one box on the right side of the screen right now

523
00:36:56,004 --> 00:37:00,685
is its own strategically-paced bit of cover that changes the flow of gameplay here.

524
00:37:00,725 --> 00:37:03,386
Like, what's that process like moving from, like, the...

525
00:37:04,784 --> 00:37:07,126
This is a high level to low level here.

526
00:37:08,767 --> 00:37:10,248
Yeah, it's difficult to explain.

527
00:37:12,990 --> 00:37:15,252
Just a lot of play testing.

528
00:37:15,612 --> 00:37:16,673
That's the only way you can do it.

529
00:37:16,693 --> 00:37:18,194
I mean, this map that you're seeing right now,

530
00:37:18,234 --> 00:37:20,555
I must have played this a thousand times.

531
00:37:21,476 --> 00:37:23,718
And every time I play, I adjust the covers around,

532
00:37:23,798 --> 00:37:24,618
and then I play again.

533
00:37:24,638 --> 00:37:25,559
And then I'm like,

534
00:37:25,739 --> 00:37:27,620
ah, this would have been so much better if I had a cover here.

535
00:37:28,161 --> 00:37:29,202
Then I adjust the covers around,

536
00:37:29,342 --> 00:37:31,843
and just keep doing that process over and over again.

537
00:37:31,863 --> 00:37:33,565
Yeah, because it's...

538
00:37:35,457 --> 00:37:40,940
I remember when we generated trees, for instance, at some point, we had a distance that we wanted

539
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,701
to put them so that you could always get a cover.

540
00:37:42,741 --> 00:37:46,584
But that doesn't work to make an interesting space in itself.

541
00:37:47,124 --> 00:37:50,526
So I think, yeah, there's no shortcut there.

542
00:37:50,666 --> 00:37:51,987
You really have to play it.

543
00:37:53,288 --> 00:37:56,170
I mean, there are some ground rules, I guess you learned after a while that, you know,

544
00:37:56,850 --> 00:38:02,054
you need to have four tiles between high cover walls in buildings or such.

545
00:38:03,849 --> 00:38:06,330
Sometimes it's fun to remove covers from an area as well.

546
00:38:06,670 --> 00:38:08,371
So the player has to make completely different decisions.

547
00:38:08,411 --> 00:38:11,952
Maybe they have to make a sprint move to get to the good covers at the other side.

548
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:16,535
But the only real way of doing this is through just a lot of play testing.

549
00:38:23,452 --> 00:38:28,074
Yeah, I got lucky with that. I mean, I had this under control. There's only one of them.

550
00:38:28,514 --> 00:38:28,734
Yeah.

551
00:38:29,494 --> 00:38:34,316
Steakapplebeats would like to know, what were your main takeaways from the beta period for this game?

552
00:38:38,157 --> 00:38:42,599
That it is a large game to balance?

553
00:38:43,299 --> 00:38:43,539
Yes.

554
00:38:43,679 --> 00:38:46,160
It's the hardest thing I've ever done.

555
00:38:49,341 --> 00:38:50,982
I mean, it is...

556
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:58,318
It's about 15 hours of gameplay, even for us that know the game very well, to try and get through it.

557
00:38:58,858 --> 00:39:05,800
And of course, like we discussed earlier, we changed the balance for the stealth, for one.

558
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:07,981
So like, how many units you can take out.

559
00:39:09,762 --> 00:39:13,303
Then you can take them out if you use the correct strategies, right?

560
00:39:14,599 --> 00:39:22,084
Lots and lots of balancing and really really tricky to balance the whole way because of the amount of time, right?

561
00:39:23,324 --> 00:39:27,727
Yeah, and I think one of the big things that have hit us from the the public

562
00:39:28,448 --> 00:39:29,648
demo that went out was

563
00:39:30,449 --> 00:39:31,049
the response

564
00:39:32,110 --> 00:39:35,072
It's taken me by surprise how much people are enjoying the game

565
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:41,836
Because we're we're completely closed. We're completely close to the game. So we can't see it anymore. We're completely blind to it and

566
00:39:42,308 --> 00:39:44,890
There's the old saying with game developers, we only deal with problems.

567
00:39:46,031 --> 00:39:47,913
That's how our entire day is, just problems all day long.

568
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:53,217
We never take a step back and go, oh, wait a minute, maybe we're actually building something that people really like.

569
00:39:53,817 --> 00:40:01,684
Yeah, but it was for balancing because we have two completely different answers from two different people, right?

570
00:40:05,535 --> 00:40:11,217
Rui, the CEO of Funcom, he's a really hardcore XCOM fan and he's constantly been telling

571
00:40:11,257 --> 00:40:12,937
us to make it harder and harder and harder.

572
00:40:15,298 --> 00:40:19,879
We have people that are not hardcore XCOM players, right, and they're all like, it's

573
00:40:19,899 --> 00:40:21,159
way too hard, it's way too hard.

574
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:27,881
And then you have, because we went with this option that you can take people out silently,

575
00:40:28,061 --> 00:40:31,722
that became another one, not just balancing a fight.

576
00:40:32,785 --> 00:40:35,426
But if you don't take anybody out, that fight will be very hard.

577
00:40:35,587 --> 00:40:38,168
If you take as many as possible out, it might become too easy.

578
00:40:38,908 --> 00:40:41,309
So that's been a tricky one.

579
00:40:41,969 --> 00:40:42,589
Have you had to...

580
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:45,571
I'm sorry, go for it, Lee.

581
00:40:46,231 --> 00:40:48,112
A top tip for any game designers out there,

582
00:40:48,192 --> 00:40:50,373
stick all your numbers in a big Excel sheet

583
00:40:51,153 --> 00:40:52,434
and make some formulas in there.

584
00:40:53,154 --> 00:40:54,615
So if you change one number somewhere,

585
00:40:54,675 --> 00:40:56,115
you can see what it does to the rest of the game.

586
00:40:56,735 --> 00:40:57,276
Yeah.

587
00:40:57,616 --> 00:40:58,616
That's my approach with this.

588
00:40:58,736 --> 00:41:01,938
And it's the only way I've been able to get on top of it, I would say.

589
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:09,157
If I change how much damage the crossbow does over here, I can roughly see where it is at the end game.

590
00:41:11,218 --> 00:41:13,740
We've finally become old enough to praise Excel.

591
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:14,060
Yeah.

592
00:41:15,461 --> 00:41:15,781
I know.

593
00:41:15,801 --> 00:41:22,545
We were making fun of Skype earlier, but I think the number one thing is Excel.

594
00:41:22,585 --> 00:41:26,207
I think that's the one thing I've learned from game designers is Excel is wonderful.

595
00:41:26,547 --> 00:41:27,868
Skype is nightmarish.

596
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:38,820
Yeah, it's true. I think that was probably the biggest thing we went through during the beta period now was just how large the game was.

597
00:41:40,941 --> 00:41:46,423
It's always hard to say how many gameplay hours you have as well, of course, early on.

598
00:41:46,804 --> 00:41:52,627
And we were playing this in different segments, you know, calling it like you would, the start of the game, the mid-game, and then like the end game.

599
00:41:52,687 --> 00:41:56,288
And we were just playing those segments, but never doing that full run.

600
00:41:58,145 --> 00:42:00,708
You want to do it as early as possible, we always do it too late.

601
00:42:01,808 --> 00:42:06,633
And in our case, that meant we had a lot of hours to balance all of a sudden.

602
00:42:06,673 --> 00:42:11,517
So maybe, um, maybe we should have, uh, I don't know what we should have changed,

603
00:42:11,557 --> 00:42:11,977
to be honest.

604
00:42:12,057 --> 00:42:12,938
It's just a large game.

605
00:42:15,300 --> 00:42:19,183
Um, Lee, I wanted to follow up on the, the kind of one that you halfway talked

606
00:42:19,203 --> 00:42:22,406
about it with, uh, an Excel spreadsheet with formulas that can change.

607
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:29,004
Did you find yourself making new formulas as development went on?

608
00:42:29,084 --> 00:42:36,328
I assume you had some sort of core balancing formulas and then made things that were tuned for specific gameplay instances.

609
00:42:36,428 --> 00:42:40,170
But after that beta period, we were sort of like, okay, I need to solve this tiny problem.

610
00:42:40,210 --> 00:42:45,233
That means I need to create this kind of formula to create something more that doesn't...

611
00:42:45,574 --> 00:42:50,136
It lets me not have to change all the base values and lets you be more flexible.

612
00:42:52,485 --> 00:43:00,309
Not as such. The Excel sheet I've been using for most of production has not changed much,

613
00:43:00,329 --> 00:43:07,052
it always changes the numbers that's in it. And the hardest thing to balance is the stealth.

614
00:43:08,273 --> 00:43:12,815
Making sure it's not too powerful, but also making sure it's not weak at the same time.

615
00:43:13,476 --> 00:43:15,817
And also making sure it doesn't get boring halfway into the game.

616
00:43:20,026 --> 00:43:21,627
Right on. Grabbing a question from chat.

617
00:43:22,028 --> 00:43:23,669
Magervalp would like to know,

618
00:43:25,090 --> 00:43:27,692
do scrap and enemies respawn so that players can grind?

619
00:43:27,792 --> 00:43:31,355
I noticed while I'm in the zone, nothing respawns,

620
00:43:31,415 --> 00:43:33,317
but I didn't return to any zones during the demo.

621
00:43:33,937 --> 00:43:37,440
And I guess the follow-up question I would ask is,

622
00:43:37,600 --> 00:43:41,303
why or why not did you implement grinding in this game

623
00:43:41,323 --> 00:43:44,305
so that players could just sort of keep gathering stuff?

624
00:43:47,088 --> 00:43:47,408
We didn't.

625
00:43:49,795 --> 00:43:57,381
Early on we actually had many meta loops that we tried out and grinding in such a

626
00:43:57,441 --> 00:44:01,985
slow-paced game as a XCOM turn-based we felt was probably not the right way to

627
00:44:02,025 --> 00:44:07,309
go. So that also I mean that makes it harder to balance in a way as well

628
00:44:07,530 --> 00:44:10,312
because if you have the grinding element of course that becomes a little bit of a

629
00:44:11,313 --> 00:44:14,976
self-balancing act from the player how much they want to you know level up

630
00:44:14,996 --> 00:44:15,796
before doing something.

631
00:44:18,185 --> 00:44:20,326
But we cut that quite early.

632
00:44:20,686 --> 00:44:24,267
It was quite early, but we did some tests with it and it wasn't really working.

633
00:44:25,068 --> 00:44:29,570
No, we felt it was not the route to go and instead tried to...

634
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:34,372
What we have though instead is we have optional maps.

635
00:44:35,433 --> 00:44:39,694
So there are forks in the road when you move around the map here.

636
00:44:40,775 --> 00:44:46,798
And there are certain almost hidden areas that you don't need to do for the story or you don't need to do to progress.

637
00:44:48,048 --> 00:44:53,952
But you can come back to it, so if you skipped them and went further in the game and it starts becoming too hard,

638
00:44:54,132 --> 00:44:56,134
then of course you could return to them at that point.

639
00:44:57,374 --> 00:45:03,719
So that's kind of our grind, those extra non-story.

640
00:45:04,620 --> 00:45:11,165
Yeah, and we found as well that without having the grind in there, it allowed us to get the balance in very, very tight.

641
00:45:12,225 --> 00:45:16,068
So we can balance it so you only just have enough medpacks, you only just have enough scrap.

642
00:45:17,436 --> 00:45:22,720
Because in a game like this, your resources really matter in the tactical side.

643
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:32,227
If you can grind for unlimited medpacks, then the tactical side of the game becomes a bit meaningless.

644
00:45:32,307 --> 00:45:35,689
There's no skill-based decision making anymore.

645
00:45:36,250 --> 00:45:39,872
There's no like, ooh, I can't really use... I should save my grenade and do something else,

646
00:45:39,932 --> 00:45:42,834
because I can just have... I've only got two of them and they're really expensive.

647
00:45:44,277 --> 00:45:48,061
That kind of gameplay disappears if you can just keep grinding the maps over and over again.

648
00:46:08,635 --> 00:46:11,157
So, that's the only thing we can say.

649
00:46:11,177 --> 00:46:13,919
And, of course, if you fail a couple of more bigger battles...

650
00:46:38,341 --> 00:46:40,685
It might take you a couple of more hours to write off the bat, right?

651
00:46:40,745 --> 00:46:45,853
Because there are some quite big fights for the later parts of the game.

652
00:46:46,772 --> 00:46:51,473
I'm actually really excited about a battle we're about to check out as we close out the

653
00:46:51,493 --> 00:46:51,993
stream today.

654
00:46:55,874 --> 00:46:59,375
After picking up Selma here, there's a really interesting battle up the hill that was the

655
00:46:59,415 --> 00:47:02,896
first time that I saw you guys spawn in new enemies.

656
00:47:03,336 --> 00:47:06,897
At first I panicked because I was like, oh no, that's way more than I expected.

657
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:11,518
And then I realized I could deal with it, and I was like, that was one of the coolest

658
00:47:11,558 --> 00:47:12,518
feelings I've had in a...

659
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:16,961
A strategy game is always, you know, oh no, and then wait, I can handle it.

660
00:47:17,462 --> 00:47:22,105
That kind of that movement from the first emotion to the second emotion is a really good one.

661
00:47:22,165 --> 00:47:24,587
So after I recruit Selma here, we'll get to look at that.

662
00:47:24,928 --> 00:47:26,649
We are coming to the end of our hour here.

663
00:47:27,389 --> 00:47:31,212
Thank you really quick to our developer friends for joining us today.

664
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,054
We've got time to take any more questions.

665
00:47:33,914 --> 00:47:38,658
We are doing our best to answer questions from players, but you know, we are hoping to...

666
00:47:39,839 --> 00:47:42,501
Learn more things about making games, so we're going to be pivoting.

667
00:47:43,681 --> 00:47:47,403
We're going to be making sure all of our questions are game development related going forward.

668
00:47:48,764 --> 00:47:54,308
A question for Lee and David. Licensed properties are kind of an interesting...

669
00:47:55,312 --> 00:48:00,276
Paradox for game developers, on the one hand they are an opportunity to attract an existing

670
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:05,619
player base or fan base, and on the other hand they incur both costs and expectations

671
00:48:05,919 --> 00:48:07,160
as you move into development.

672
00:48:07,901 --> 00:48:13,685
What was your experience going from IO Interactive and sort of having more control over Hitman

673
00:48:13,805 --> 00:48:23,692
and what Hitman is to going solo and working on a, even if it was a lesser known internationally

674
00:48:25,753 --> 00:48:27,535
It was still one that had some expectations with it.

675
00:48:31,258 --> 00:48:37,362
Yeah, what to say, actually we were lucky enough to get quite free hands on this one.

676
00:48:38,143 --> 00:48:40,305
And what we wanted to do with it.

677
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:47,651
In this case, and of course maybe that's partly because it isn't a big international IP, yet.

678
00:48:48,671 --> 00:48:48,912
Yes.

679
00:48:48,932 --> 00:48:50,573
So we were...

680
00:48:53,203 --> 00:48:59,124
We were blessed by that. The guy that made the original pen and papers back in the day

681
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:04,485
was actually one of the first backers and investors as well. He was really on board

682
00:49:04,505 --> 00:49:05,326
with it.

683
00:49:06,306 --> 00:49:07,626
It's been really smooth, actually.

684
00:49:07,646 --> 00:49:11,667
Yeah, it's been really smooth, actually. In our case. I don't know if that will apply

685
00:49:11,707 --> 00:49:17,688
to everybody, right? There is, of course, like you say, that trade-off otherwise. But

686
00:49:17,728 --> 00:49:20,949
I think we showed what we wanted to do.

687
00:49:22,976 --> 00:49:27,158
very early on, very honestly, this type of gameplay and all that.

688
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:33,561
And got that okayed early on, and then it has been smooth sailing for us.

689
00:49:36,562 --> 00:49:40,224
So yeah, maybe not the right people to answer that question.

690
00:49:49,184 --> 00:49:53,787
I'm so happy that you said this was the first real encounter you felt, because that was the idea.

691
00:49:54,547 --> 00:49:57,749
This is the road fight, which it's been called.

692
00:49:57,789 --> 00:50:01,672
It was supposed to be the first challenging challenge you would get in the game.

693
00:50:02,533 --> 00:50:02,993
So we've...

694
00:50:05,174 --> 00:50:08,557
Not now, towards the end of the project, but towards the middle of the project,

695
00:50:08,617 --> 00:50:10,858
I think we were balancing the game around this fight.

696
00:50:11,799 --> 00:50:13,780
That's important, right? To have some sort of...

697
00:50:13,820 --> 00:50:17,263
This was the first fight that's meant to carry on for a little bit longer.

698
00:50:17,713 --> 00:50:19,615
Yeah, this was really cool.

699
00:50:19,635 --> 00:50:21,116
Like watching this...

700
00:50:21,156 --> 00:50:22,177
The fact that this butcher...

701
00:50:23,218 --> 00:50:24,559
You're about to see me take him out right now,

702
00:50:24,619 --> 00:50:27,221
but midway through the fight, I don't know if we'll have time to show it,

703
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:30,024
because I kept playing for past the hour that we have today.

704
00:50:31,025 --> 00:50:32,246
But...

705
00:50:33,467 --> 00:50:36,069
The medbot that is around the corner over there

706
00:50:37,170 --> 00:50:39,832
ran up and resurrected that butcher midway through the fight.

707
00:50:39,852 --> 00:50:40,553
And I was just like, what?

708
00:50:41,714 --> 00:50:42,435
I dealt with him!

709
00:50:43,075 --> 00:50:43,676
What are you doing?

710
00:50:45,577 --> 00:50:48,640
Quite a few interesting enemies that you come across.

711
00:50:49,360 --> 00:50:51,742
So that changes the fight dynamic a little bit, doesn't it?

712
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:53,443
Yeah.

713
00:50:53,484 --> 00:50:58,127
That was also one of our key game design things that we wanted to do.

714
00:50:58,167 --> 00:51:00,869
Make sure that you have to make a choice which enemy,

715
00:51:02,150 --> 00:51:05,293
and maybe in the middle of the fight having to switch that choice, right?

716
00:51:05,353 --> 00:51:06,574
That's kind of what the medbot does.

717
00:51:06,934 --> 00:51:10,076
If he goes running for somebody, if he went for this axe ghoul here,

718
00:51:10,136 --> 00:51:12,998
maybe you would be okay with that because it's just an axe ghoul.

719
00:51:14,066 --> 00:51:17,728
To heal a stronger character, you'll have to deal with a wrench in, right?

720
00:51:17,748 --> 00:51:18,929
I used to play X-Wing as well.

721
00:51:43,410 --> 00:51:46,232
Oh hey, you should come back for 2.0, it's fun.

722
00:51:47,992 --> 00:51:51,074
Oh yeah, that's right. Yeah, we should pick you up.

723
00:51:51,134 --> 00:51:55,876
Oh, FFG owes me, FFG needs to owe me something, I don't know.

724
00:51:55,976 --> 00:51:58,177
Getting game designers hyped about X-Wing is my new brand.

725
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:16,510
I guess as we move out, this is sort of just, is there anything I guess you all have been thinking about, like you sort of have been running up to other game designers at the bar, in this magical Swedish bar where everyone from Ubisoft to DICE is hanging out?

726
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:20,414
Is there anything you've been running up and sort of telling other game devs like,

727
00:52:20,454 --> 00:52:26,579
hey, like we learned this either striking out on our own or going into a genre we didn't know anything about before.

728
00:52:26,720 --> 00:52:31,544
Is there anything you all have been saying that you think other devs would like to hear?

729
00:52:34,627 --> 00:52:36,909
Oh, that's a difficult one.

730
00:52:37,249 --> 00:52:37,970
That's a...

731
00:52:41,867 --> 00:52:44,528
Yeah, we've been saying loads, but I don't know if you can say it on camera.

732
00:52:44,689 --> 00:52:45,929
Yeah.

733
00:52:46,890 --> 00:52:47,650
Swearing is allowed.

734
00:52:47,670 --> 00:52:55,733
No, we haven't... I don't know if there have been that many curveballs for us this time around

735
00:52:55,774 --> 00:52:58,595
when it comes to the actual game development.

736
00:53:00,796 --> 00:53:02,396
Maybe buying off a bit too much.

737
00:53:02,617 --> 00:53:03,417
Yeah, but that's always the case.

738
00:53:09,435 --> 00:53:12,776
No, and then you come into on the technical side with Unreal,

739
00:53:12,796 --> 00:53:15,998
we've actually been reasonably pleased with Unreal.

740
00:53:18,719 --> 00:53:23,101
We did a late upgrade, which you never should, right?

741
00:53:23,621 --> 00:53:28,723
To the engine, which caused us a bit of a headache towards the end.

742
00:53:28,783 --> 00:53:34,526
But other than that, it's also been reasonably smooth sailing.

743
00:53:34,566 --> 00:53:36,547
But if you do work in Unreal, make sure you...

744
00:53:37,890 --> 00:53:41,731
If you're having problems with loading times, make sure you handle that early on.

745
00:53:44,072 --> 00:53:49,913
That's one that came back to bite us because we had a bit of technical issues after upgrading

746
00:53:50,573 --> 00:53:56,994
that certain things would not work in the same way, and then having to redo a lot of stuff.

747
00:53:57,974 --> 00:54:02,315
Just kind of a, this is not necessarily the most brilliant question to ask,

748
00:54:02,375 --> 00:54:04,915
oh my god, here's where the respawn happened, and I just was like, what?

749
00:54:04,935 --> 00:54:06,976
If I...

750
00:54:11,389 --> 00:54:14,070
I do love actually the horn he has on his head on the back of his pack.

751
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:20,971
I was going to say, something I've been hearing from devs a lot lately with both Unreal and

752
00:54:21,092 --> 00:54:26,413
Unity, oh god yeah, poor Selma, I had to struggle, I struggle a little bit with, I did win this

753
00:54:26,453 --> 00:54:28,454
fight for the record, I did not die and have to do it again.

754
00:54:28,474 --> 00:54:31,454
So whatever you see today, know that it works out okay.

755
00:54:33,795 --> 00:54:37,277
I was going to ask, I know that a lot of developers working in Unreal and Unity

756
00:54:37,577 --> 00:54:44,180
are utilizing the store's marketplace to get a lot of pre-baked and pre-built tools and plugins

757
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:48,623
to help improve their game making experience.

758
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:54,405
Did you all rely on any tools from that setting and did they help you out at all?

759
00:54:55,786 --> 00:54:57,727
Yes, and that's actually one thing.

760
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,568
The marketplace works really well for the asset side.

761
00:55:02,912 --> 00:55:06,456
I think it's very risky if you go into more complicated blueprints.

762
00:55:07,157 --> 00:55:11,481
Because that's one where it might not be tested that well.

763
00:55:11,661 --> 00:55:14,364
And then we ran into that with upgrading as well, right?

764
00:55:14,384 --> 00:55:17,687
That maybe the support had been dropped or you were using it in a way

765
00:55:19,269 --> 00:55:21,511
that the original developers didn't think about.

766
00:55:21,852 --> 00:55:24,975
If you haven't built it yourself, it might take more time, right?

767
00:55:25,475 --> 00:55:26,596
So I think when it comes to...

768
00:55:27,248 --> 00:55:32,370
I mean, plugins, yeah, of course, if it's solid C++ stuff, I don't think it's a problem.

769
00:55:32,390 --> 00:55:38,193
But we did have some problems with some blueprints that we had bought early on that got used

770
00:55:38,273 --> 00:55:45,037
in the game that took a lot of time to fix in the end.

771
00:55:46,257 --> 00:55:50,079
So I think you should be careful when you buy, because a lot of people when they do

772
00:55:50,239 --> 00:55:52,180
assets on the store, they like to show it off.

773
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:55,502
So they make really complicated materials, for instance, which you can't really

774
00:55:56,137 --> 00:55:58,959
using the end because I mean, we're shipping this on console.

775
00:55:58,999 --> 00:56:05,023
So we can't have massive super smart materials everywhere that would ruin performance.

776
00:56:05,063 --> 00:56:05,264
Right.

777
00:56:05,424 --> 00:56:08,626
But it's also doing more than we actually need to.

778
00:56:09,827 --> 00:56:10,167
Yeah.

779
00:56:10,487 --> 00:56:15,331
So we actually, we were pretty adamant early on, at least where we, if we bought something,

780
00:56:15,351 --> 00:56:20,015
we would actually put it in a different project and then just move stuff over to force ourselves

781
00:56:20,055 --> 00:56:21,256
to kind of rebuild materials.

782
00:56:21,276 --> 00:56:22,096
We'll use the textures.

783
00:56:22,116 --> 00:56:25,759
We'll use the meshes and such to kind of force ourselves to do it.

784
00:56:26,297 --> 00:56:30,519
so that we wouldn't end up bloated with all this, because that's probably the biggest

785
00:56:31,640 --> 00:56:34,761
problem you could run into, that you bloat the game because it's so easy.

786
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:42,205
That's the danger with blueprint scripting in general, I would say, that you need to

787
00:56:42,645 --> 00:56:49,869
kind of keep it clean, otherwise you end up with a mess where you have a lot of messy

788
00:56:49,929 --> 00:56:53,371
blueprint scripting, having important stuff in the game that...

789
00:56:54,674 --> 00:57:00,855
Yeah, we've had a few now lately as well, right, where I think everybody works in Unreal,

790
00:57:00,875 --> 00:57:04,776
runs into this at some point where you make some blueprints early on when you're prototyping

791
00:57:05,716 --> 00:57:10,337
and then you kind of forget that those blueprints are not up to, you know, shipping spec.

792
00:57:10,978 --> 00:57:15,158
They might not support the save games in the correct way or all that stuff, right?

793
00:57:16,879 --> 00:57:21,120
So yeah, you need to kind of keep track of that and if you bring in too many blueprints

794
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:24,220
from the marketplace I think that might become an issue for you.

795
00:57:26,320 --> 00:57:33,603
Right on. It is here in California, the sun is rising, it is about 8 o'clock.

796
00:57:35,003 --> 00:57:37,944
We are running out of time sadly to continue this conversation.

797
00:57:37,964 --> 00:57:42,565
I will, before we get out of here, throw a couple questions from chat in just to help you all out.

798
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:45,926
But before we, you know, sort of start wrapping up,

799
00:57:46,907 --> 00:57:50,288
Eric Viper would just quickly like to know, will there be a new Game Plus on launch,

800
00:57:50,368 --> 00:57:52,108
or is that something you all are looking at later?

801
00:57:55,323 --> 00:57:58,845
There's no plans for launch, but we're looking at a lot of things for later.

802
00:57:59,405 --> 00:58:00,906
Cool.

803
00:58:02,046 --> 00:58:03,967
It's this thing where you can have... I think he's making the game.

804
00:58:03,987 --> 00:58:06,289
Yeah, it's like a nightmare mode.

805
00:58:06,409 --> 00:58:08,310
Oh, the nightmare mode. Yeah, actually we...

806
00:58:09,330 --> 00:58:14,093
More accurately, it's where you run through the game again with stuff you already have from your first run.

807
00:58:14,873 --> 00:58:16,434
Ah, yeah, and with more...

808
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:19,796
No, it's not something we've planned right now.

809
00:58:20,872 --> 00:58:27,416
We did include the Iron Man mode from the start, which has been a discussion back and forth if we wanted to do that.

810
00:58:28,736 --> 00:58:30,637
Because it is really, really, really tough.

811
00:58:33,579 --> 00:58:36,320
But we felt that if people want to punish themselves, they should be able to.

812
00:58:50,432 --> 00:58:53,854
Yeah, we can't really talk about launch, post-launch plans yet.

813
00:58:53,874 --> 00:58:55,475
Because it hasn't happened yet.

814
00:58:56,975 --> 00:58:57,415
Sorry.

815
00:58:58,296 --> 00:59:00,297
But Funcom's been really good.

816
00:59:00,337 --> 00:59:05,879
They've been helping us with the marketing, QA, some development support as well.

817
00:59:05,939 --> 00:59:10,961
We've been borrowing programmers from them to help out with UI and localization.

818
00:59:11,602 --> 00:59:16,324
They've been helping us with a lot of the wrapping that goes on around the game.

819
00:59:17,615 --> 00:59:23,920
So QA stuff, localization stuff, marketing stuff, looking after people on forums and

820
00:59:24,521 --> 00:59:25,321
all these kind of things.

821
00:59:26,262 --> 00:59:29,625
Which is a lot of game developers tend to forget about, but it's really important when

822
00:59:29,645 --> 00:59:30,546
you want to launch a game.

823
00:59:32,408 --> 00:59:36,491
Yeah, especially we would never have localized the game if we didn't have Funcom because

824
00:59:36,511 --> 00:59:41,556
that is a huge thing to do a lot of times, especially we have a lot of voice acting and

825
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:45,579
we have a lot of menus that would have been completely unfeasible for us.

826
00:59:48,021 --> 00:59:53,345
And yeah, like I said, they have their QA, of course, and then being able to borrow a

827
00:59:53,365 --> 00:59:57,388
few programmers for a while has also been a blessing.

828
00:59:59,149 --> 00:59:59,369
Nice.

829
01:00:00,310 --> 01:00:04,413
With that, I think it's time to pleasantly wrap things up.

830
01:00:04,433 --> 01:00:07,175
Thank you, Lee, David, and Kali so much for joining us.

831
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,458
If they've got any more questions about making the game, where should they ask them?

832
01:00:13,968 --> 01:00:17,609
There's the official Funcom forum, where you can go there and ask some questions.

833
01:00:18,209 --> 01:00:19,130
I think it's probably the best place.

834
01:00:21,470 --> 01:00:25,892
I guess you're free to send us stuff on the Bearded Lady's Facebook page as well,

835
01:00:25,932 --> 01:00:29,813
but we actually handle that one, so we might not be super quick to answer,

836
01:00:30,154 --> 01:00:33,875
since we're kind of in release mode here.

837
01:00:34,355 --> 01:00:36,816
Speaking of release mode, thank you so much for taking the time to join us.

838
01:00:38,924 --> 01:00:42,846
I should also say if you said it's sunny in California now, I think we just got our first

839
01:00:42,986 --> 01:00:43,266
snow.

840
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:45,827
Somebody just shouted out.

841
01:00:46,607 --> 01:00:47,708
I'm jealous.

842
01:00:48,308 --> 01:00:49,309
Oh, I love snow.

843
01:00:49,329 --> 01:00:54,451
I mean, in theory, I have a mountain just like a few hours east that I can go to for

844
01:00:54,471 --> 01:00:56,312
snow, but I keep forgetting to do that.

845
01:00:58,273 --> 01:00:59,173
It's going to rain tonight.

846
01:00:59,273 --> 01:01:01,054
It's going to rain tonight in California, finally.

847
01:01:01,254 --> 01:01:02,495
Congratulations, California.

848
01:01:04,464 --> 01:01:06,745
We need it, although it might cause mudslides.

849
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:08,565
So I don't know.

850
01:01:10,226 --> 01:01:13,847
Anyway, thank you all for joining us today on the GDC Twitch channel.

851
01:01:13,867 --> 01:01:15,248
Thank you for joining us so early.

852
01:01:16,789 --> 01:01:21,690
Mutant Year Zero launches on December 4th.

853
01:01:22,691 --> 01:01:24,532
Or I should say Mutant Year Zero Road to Eden.

854
01:01:26,812 --> 01:01:28,973
You can check it out on Steam, Xbox, and PS4.

855
01:01:29,013 --> 01:01:32,595
For us at GDC, we would love it.

856
01:01:32,955 --> 01:01:33,835
For those of you who are not...

857
01:01:34,035 --> 01:01:35,156
I'm not familiar with the channel.

858
01:01:35,676 --> 01:01:46,139
If you were to click the follow button, if you're a person who likes talking to game developers, learning about how games get made,

859
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:52,721
what you'll find out is that we do a lot of streams with them now, talking to different devs about how their games are.

860
01:01:53,421 --> 01:01:57,522
What's really cool is GDC is coming up in March, and we...

861
01:01:58,583 --> 01:02:02,166
More and more speakers, more and more talks confirmed for next year's show.

862
01:02:02,926 --> 01:02:06,750
And what's cool is we are planning to start talking to a lot of them this year.

863
01:02:07,130 --> 01:02:10,212
So we're going to be talking to them about their game, as their games get made.

864
01:02:10,553 --> 01:02:12,915
Usually we're doing, you know, we're trying to check out new games.

865
01:02:12,955 --> 01:02:16,157
We're talking to developers about games that are very interesting or very unique

866
01:02:16,237 --> 01:02:19,260
or like, like Mutant Year Zero, which, or you know.

867
01:02:20,921 --> 01:02:25,823
But also, by talking to GDC speakers, we have an opportunity to revisit games from last year.

868
01:02:25,843 --> 01:02:32,746
So, we don't quite know yet who we're getting, but we plan to bring them to you and ask them interesting questions on your behalf.

869
01:02:34,247 --> 01:02:41,550
While I'm at it, if you're interested in GDC yourself, you can always scroll down and click the button in order to get your own pass for GDC.

870
01:02:43,271 --> 01:02:49,494
And apparently in chat, I don't know if Calicloven works for Funcom, but they would like everyone

871
01:02:49,514 --> 01:02:53,576
to know that if you are interested in this game, check out the Funcom stream happening

872
01:02:53,596 --> 01:02:55,257
in one hour for Mutant Gear Zero.

873
01:02:56,238 --> 01:02:58,019
They say there is a, quote, surprise coming.

874
01:02:58,039 --> 01:02:59,659
I don't know what that means.

875
01:02:59,699 --> 01:03:04,402
I don't know if Cal works for Funcom or not, but in case you are at home or interested,

876
01:03:04,442 --> 01:03:05,522
you should definitely go check it out.

877
01:03:05,923 --> 01:03:09,064
David's looking at, David's looking at, casting a knowing look.

878
01:03:11,765 --> 01:03:14,767
I hope the surprise is a nice surprise and not a sad surprise.

879
01:03:15,087 --> 01:03:17,428
I think we know what it is.

880
01:03:18,588 --> 01:03:24,271
Alright, with that, thank you everyone so much for joining us. Have a good day. Bye.

881
01:03:24,291 --> 01:03:25,311
Thank you.
