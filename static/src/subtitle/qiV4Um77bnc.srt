1
00:00:06,067 --> 00:00:08,107
Hi, thank you so much.

2
00:00:08,107 --> 00:00:09,368
So many people came.

3
00:00:09,368 --> 00:00:11,168
I really appreciate this.

4
00:00:11,168 --> 00:00:12,909
My name is Leigh Alexander.

5
00:00:12,909 --> 00:00:15,730
Before I get started, I just want to get a couple things

6
00:00:15,730 --> 00:00:16,610
out of the way.

7
00:00:16,610 --> 00:00:18,491
The excellent title of this talk

8
00:00:18,491 --> 00:00:20,731
was unfortunately not done by me.

9
00:00:20,731 --> 00:00:23,572
It was my awesome friend and colleague, Matt Lees

10
00:00:23,572 --> 00:00:25,713
from Shut Up and Sit Down and Cool Ghosts.

11
00:00:25,713 --> 00:00:27,834
I wish I could take credit, but unfortunately,

12
00:00:27,834 --> 00:00:29,734
I'm terrible at coming up with things.

13
00:00:29,734 --> 00:00:31,235
Great quality for a creative writer.

14
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:38,039
And also want to give a shout out to David for letting me tether with his internet because

15
00:00:38,039 --> 00:00:39,981
otherwise I wouldn't have been able to run my presentation.

16
00:00:39,981 --> 00:00:45,005
So technically incompetent too, great skills for game development.

17
00:00:45,005 --> 00:00:48,288
Anyway, it's been a few years since I have been at GDC.

18
00:00:48,288 --> 00:00:54,293
I used to be a games industry journalist and a games critic up until about a few years

19
00:00:54,293 --> 00:00:55,194
ago when

20
00:00:55,773 --> 00:00:58,094
I guess let's say I decided I could do,

21
00:00:58,094 --> 00:00:59,915
I did all I could do in that space.

22
00:00:59,915 --> 00:01:02,777
And I decided I was just gonna quit video games totally

23
00:01:02,777 --> 00:01:04,258
and explore some new horizons.

24
00:01:04,258 --> 00:01:08,001
So I made a podcast for The Guardian on digital culture.

25
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,743
I started writing fiction and stuff about our virtual lives,

26
00:01:11,743 --> 00:01:12,824
all clear, totally.

27
00:01:12,824 --> 00:01:17,166
My undercut's growing back in, I was done.

28
00:01:17,166 --> 00:01:19,468
So I'm here today to talk about Reigns for Majesty.

29
00:01:19,468 --> 00:01:23,050
It is the follow-up to the well-loved original Reigns game

30
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:23,590
from Neryal.

31
00:01:23,590 --> 00:01:24,371
It has done.

32
00:01:24,916 --> 00:01:26,337
Pretty well on the app charts.

33
00:01:26,337 --> 00:01:27,999
We've gotten some really nice press.

34
00:01:27,999 --> 00:01:30,721
And we're nominated for Best Mobile Game

35
00:01:30,721 --> 00:01:33,263
here at the Game Developers Choice Awards this week.

36
00:01:33,263 --> 00:01:34,604
We're nominated for, thank you.

37
00:01:34,604 --> 00:01:34,864
Thank you.

38
00:01:34,864 --> 00:01:35,244
Thank you.

39
00:01:35,244 --> 00:01:40,068
Thank you.

40
00:01:40,068 --> 00:01:40,409
Thank you.

41
00:01:40,409 --> 00:01:40,749
Thank you.

42
00:01:40,749 --> 00:01:41,850
Wait, you're still clapping.

43
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,411
I've got more accolades to list.

44
00:01:43,411 --> 00:01:45,913
We're nominated for a British Game Bafta.

45
00:01:45,913 --> 00:01:48,736
My role was as the project's writer and narrative director.

46
00:01:48,736 --> 00:01:51,518
The whole team and I want to thank so much all the players

47
00:01:51,518 --> 00:01:52,639
who made the game a success.

48
00:01:53,289 --> 00:01:57,611
If you hadn't heard, Nintendo will be bringing Reigns King and Queens to the Switch.

49
00:01:57,611 --> 00:02:03,274
I know, look mom, I'm on the Nintendo.

50
00:02:03,274 --> 00:02:07,456
And there's going to be a co-op mode where you have to have consensus with the other

51
00:02:07,456 --> 00:02:08,637
player to swipe.

52
00:02:08,637 --> 00:02:12,659
So I think that should enable some really cool discussions.

53
00:02:12,659 --> 00:02:19,242
As you can see though, my plan to burn all my bridges and quit video games forever has

54
00:02:19,242 --> 00:02:20,183
not been a success.

55
00:02:20,770 --> 00:02:22,190
There have been some setbacks.

56
00:02:22,190 --> 00:02:24,391
Along with some other wonderful writers,

57
00:02:24,391 --> 00:02:27,512
I got to do a piece for Where the Water Tastes Like Wine.

58
00:02:27,512 --> 00:02:29,872
I'm also a writer on Chance Agency's Neo Cab,

59
00:02:29,872 --> 00:02:32,313
which is an upcoming narrative experience

60
00:02:32,313 --> 00:02:34,073
about emotional labor in the gig economy.

61
00:02:34,073 --> 00:02:36,974
And I do a lot of world building, narrative design,

62
00:02:36,974 --> 00:02:39,055
writing, consulting on indie projects, blah, blah.

63
00:02:39,055 --> 00:02:41,856
I even wrote and helped write and design something

64
00:02:41,856 --> 00:02:43,156
for Amazon Alexa.

65
00:02:43,156 --> 00:02:45,497
So I guess I became a game designer.

66
00:02:45,497 --> 00:02:46,877
I don't know how this happened.

67
00:02:48,001 --> 00:02:52,584
Her Majesty team was Francois Alliot, who's the designer of Reigns. It's his system.

68
00:02:52,584 --> 00:02:56,446
He made the system and the tools. The essence of Reigns is very much his heritage.

69
00:02:56,446 --> 00:03:03,651
Our artist, Arnaud Debac, carried on the color-blocked visual style that artist Mieko Murakami introduced in the original Reigns.

70
00:03:03,651 --> 00:03:06,193
You can also thank Arnaud for the maze.

71
00:03:06,193 --> 00:03:12,096
We were also lucky enough to have music from legendary Jim Guthrie, J.J. Ibsen, and sound from Eric Van Amerangen.

72
00:03:12,096 --> 00:03:15,178
So we were, of course, published by the excellent folks at Devolver.

73
00:03:16,142 --> 00:03:18,908
So the original Reigns has been extremely successful

74
00:03:18,908 --> 00:03:21,032
thanks to this quirky Tinder interface

75
00:03:21,032 --> 00:03:22,616
that lets you manage a kingdom

76
00:03:22,616 --> 00:03:24,780
and unfold a story by swiping cards.

77
00:03:25,235 --> 00:03:30,316
But lots of players started expressing their wish to play as a queen, which is where I came in.

78
00:03:30,316 --> 00:03:34,337
So when I was invited to the project, I actually had a really unique opportunity.

79
00:03:34,337 --> 00:03:38,959
It's one that I think is quite rare in our industry, in which I felt very grateful to have.

80
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,560
We were not starting from scratch. We had this system that had already excited people with its narrative potential.

81
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,021
My teammates tended to give me quite a lot of space, both in a big-picture way,

82
00:03:49,021 --> 00:03:53,543
in terms of the details of the writing itself, to figure out how best to tell the stories of the queen.

83
00:03:54,339 --> 00:04:00,162
And in this talk I will share a lot of the considerations I had in mind as I worked and hopefully you will find those interesting.

84
00:04:00,162 --> 00:04:06,725
I do want to warn this discussion may contain some kind of like binary form treatment of gender.

85
00:04:06,725 --> 00:04:14,189
Some of that has been hard for me to wrangle when I'm talking about making the queen version of a king game when the game uses you know historical fiction stereotypes.

86
00:04:14,189 --> 00:04:17,310
So I apologize in advance for my limited reference point.

87
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,532
Obviously gender is greater than you know man and woman and hopefully.

88
00:04:20,845 --> 00:04:23,106
these design ideas about kings and queens

89
00:04:23,106 --> 00:04:25,627
can be relevant to everybody.

90
00:04:25,627 --> 00:04:27,088
So let's start with a quick rundown

91
00:04:27,088 --> 00:04:30,209
of the key elements of Rain's games, at least as I see them.

92
00:04:30,209 --> 00:04:33,190
So these are the traits that fundamentally formed

93
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:36,151
my narrative design toolbox and were the foundation out

94
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:37,932
of which the queen's story emerged.

95
00:04:37,932 --> 00:04:40,773
Basically, characters come up to you and ask silly questions.

96
00:04:40,773 --> 00:04:42,293
And you have to make your best guess

97
00:04:42,293 --> 00:04:44,174
about the potential outcome of your choices,

98
00:04:44,174 --> 00:04:46,375
both narratively and statistically.

99
00:04:46,375 --> 00:04:49,476
And yeah, then you swipe and see what the effect was.

100
00:04:49,877 --> 00:04:52,820
You navigate the story branches and their associated puzzles

101
00:04:52,820 --> 00:04:54,402
by swiping left or right.

102
00:04:54,402 --> 00:04:57,826
Your decisions have somewhat predictable but occasionally

103
00:04:57,826 --> 00:05:00,449
unpredictable effects on the health of your kingdom's

104
00:05:00,449 --> 00:05:03,453
four key markers, which are the church, your people, your army,

105
00:05:03,453 --> 00:05:05,215
and your finances.

106
00:05:05,215 --> 00:05:07,677
If any of these become entirely empty or full,

107
00:05:07,677 --> 00:05:10,040
it triggers a death, and you are revived to rule again.

108
00:05:10,552 --> 00:05:13,994
So living as long as possible is a viable goal for many players.

109
00:05:13,994 --> 00:05:15,435
It's less so in Reigns.

110
00:05:15,435 --> 00:05:17,897
It's less of the primary objective in Reigns, Her Majesty,

111
00:05:17,897 --> 00:05:19,698
than it was in the first game.

112
00:05:19,698 --> 00:05:22,280
Avoiding death is a subconscious primary driver as you play.

113
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:25,883
But more importantly, the experience of Her Majesty

114
00:05:25,883 --> 00:05:28,225
is about what you can do within the confines

115
00:05:28,225 --> 00:05:29,706
of your little life.

116
00:05:29,706 --> 00:05:32,508
You can discover something new, unlock an avenue

117
00:05:32,508 --> 00:05:34,269
that will create progression.

118
00:05:34,269 --> 00:05:36,371
That's the foundation of the experience.

119
00:05:36,371 --> 00:05:38,652
And some really unexpected and complex things

120
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:40,053
are often able to emerge from it.

121
00:05:40,643 --> 00:05:43,244
So yeah, dying in as many ways as possible

122
00:05:43,244 --> 00:05:45,126
and unlocking all the possible deaths

123
00:05:45,126 --> 00:05:46,807
is another objective that our players

124
00:05:46,807 --> 00:05:48,227
have been enthusiastic about.

125
00:05:48,227 --> 00:05:50,269
So many of my friends are like,

126
00:05:50,269 --> 00:05:53,030
I like your game, but I'm so bad at it, I just keep dying.

127
00:05:53,030 --> 00:05:55,832
And I'm like, well, yeah.

128
00:05:55,832 --> 00:05:58,414
You're supposed to.

129
00:05:58,414 --> 00:06:00,115
Yeah, this is something of an aside,

130
00:06:00,115 --> 00:06:02,556
but it's funny to me how conditioned players are

131
00:06:02,556 --> 00:06:05,738
to associate death or an ending with failure

132
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:07,399
and how a sense of dissatisfaction

133
00:06:07,399 --> 00:06:09,480
always tells them they've done something wrong.

134
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,245
rather than gives them a clue to keep searching.

135
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,508
Empirically, I hear this more from women,

136
00:06:14,508 --> 00:06:16,289
my women friends who play the game,

137
00:06:16,289 --> 00:06:18,612
like, oh my god, I'm so sorry, I just suck,

138
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:19,653
which makes me sad.

139
00:06:19,653 --> 00:06:20,594
So I just want to tell you all

140
00:06:20,594 --> 00:06:22,535
that none of you suck at Reigns.

141
00:06:22,535 --> 00:06:24,377
Don't feel discouraged by dying a lot.

142
00:06:24,377 --> 00:06:26,940
You know, the story of every ruler has to end,

143
00:06:26,940 --> 00:06:28,561
and death is just a beginning.

144
00:06:28,561 --> 00:06:30,343
Can you tell the developers are French?

145
00:06:33,137 --> 00:06:34,517
So the original Reigns, of course,

146
00:06:34,517 --> 00:06:36,859
had a king who could be as hapless or as brutal

147
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:38,079
as you wanted him to be.

148
00:06:38,079 --> 00:06:40,641
The game was fun because you were a bit ridiculous,

149
00:06:40,641 --> 00:06:42,302
but you still sustained the sense

150
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:44,723
of being part of something epic, which gives you

151
00:06:44,723 --> 00:06:47,285
fun themes like the fragility of power,

152
00:06:47,285 --> 00:06:50,186
the caprices of the masses, and lots of dark comedy

153
00:06:50,186 --> 00:06:53,028
about the brutality of life in the Middle Ages.

154
00:06:53,028 --> 00:06:56,510
Now, the first Reigns had an overarching narrative

155
00:06:56,510 --> 00:06:58,651
whereby the king had been cursed by the devil

156
00:06:58,651 --> 00:07:00,712
to keep returning to life, and he had to find a way

157
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,813
to escape these loops.

158
00:07:02,272 --> 00:07:06,355
narratively and literally. The characters were mostly comic archetypes and while

159
00:07:06,355 --> 00:07:09,677
there was some courtly intrigue and interpersonal relations stuff, the

160
00:07:09,677 --> 00:07:14,100
decisions frequently mainly concerned large-scale kingdom issues like how to

161
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:18,664
deal with wars or diseases, crusades. Our settings are not so much

162
00:07:18,664 --> 00:07:23,207
historical as they are inspired by history. Both of the games use familiar

163
00:07:23,207 --> 00:07:26,929
and archetypal types of concepts and events like a powerful church corrupted

164
00:07:26,929 --> 00:07:29,351
by wealth or an unexpected drought causing a war.

165
00:07:30,091 --> 00:07:31,612
So we knew pretty early on that we

166
00:07:31,612 --> 00:07:35,716
wanted to move this new Reign story about a queen

167
00:07:35,716 --> 00:07:38,459
into a Renaissance-inspired period.

168
00:07:38,459 --> 00:07:41,982
Beyond that, we decided not to simply make the king a woman

169
00:07:41,982 --> 00:07:44,485
or create a female protagonist without changing

170
00:07:44,485 --> 00:07:45,546
her lens on power.

171
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:48,489
I mean, sure, we're making a comedic, flippantly violent,

172
00:07:48,489 --> 00:07:50,210
ahistorical fantasy pastiche.

173
00:07:50,577 --> 00:07:53,239
But to me, the idea of simply having the ruler now

174
00:07:53,239 --> 00:07:55,820
be a woman instead of a man without changing

175
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,901
any of the underlying politics or perspectives

176
00:07:57,901 --> 00:08:00,363
would not be challenging in any sense of the world.

177
00:08:00,363 --> 00:08:03,364
I generally find power fantasies boring.

178
00:08:03,364 --> 00:08:05,665
So I really wanted a reigns queen

179
00:08:05,665 --> 00:08:08,147
to face some non-traditional types of friction

180
00:08:08,147 --> 00:08:10,408
rather than leaving it simply at, well, a woman can

181
00:08:10,408 --> 00:08:12,009
do whatever a man can do.

182
00:08:12,009 --> 00:08:15,251
An equal society asks us to account for and understand

183
00:08:15,251 --> 00:08:17,672
differences in experiences, not to simply ignore them

184
00:08:17,672 --> 00:08:18,773
and hope they go away.

185
00:08:19,738 --> 00:08:24,584
For example, plenty of women achieve power and success within the same systems that promote

186
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:25,986
inequality for others.

187
00:08:25,986 --> 00:08:30,211
They may even end up as shields for corporate or governmental abuses because they appear

188
00:08:30,211 --> 00:08:32,113
to put a progressive face on them.

189
00:08:32,113 --> 00:08:36,158
And we're intended to find it inspiring in some sense that occasionally women are anointed

190
00:08:36,158 --> 00:08:37,059
with this type of success.

191
00:08:37,675 --> 00:08:40,579
Like, Ivanka Trump, Yas Queen, right?

192
00:08:40,579 --> 00:08:43,303
I didn't want to uncritically replicate

193
00:08:43,303 --> 00:08:46,388
the power of the Reigns King by just putting a woman's face

194
00:08:46,388 --> 00:08:46,548
on it.

195
00:08:46,548 --> 00:08:49,652
I need to emphasize that Reigns Her Majesty is not

196
00:08:49,652 --> 00:08:50,393
super deep.

197
00:08:50,393 --> 00:08:51,174
It's light.

198
00:08:51,174 --> 00:08:52,516
It's rooted in archetypes.

199
00:08:52,516 --> 00:08:54,619
It's meant to be funny and bleak.

200
00:08:55,009 --> 00:08:56,750
Well, of course, I took the opportunity

201
00:08:56,750 --> 00:08:59,211
to make a reigns led by women seriously,

202
00:08:59,211 --> 00:09:01,412
and I worked in a way that I felt was sincere.

203
00:09:01,412 --> 00:09:03,674
I didn't have any pretenses that I was reinventing

204
00:09:03,674 --> 00:09:05,054
any kind of great wheels.

205
00:09:05,054 --> 00:09:07,236
Basically, I'm not here on the advocacy track

206
00:09:07,236 --> 00:09:10,017
to tell you that you should celebrate the great victory

207
00:09:10,017 --> 00:09:12,198
for feminism I attained in our funny Tinder game,

208
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:14,379
which you can buy on the App Store, Google Play, and Steam

209
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:14,499
for $2.99.

210
00:09:14,499 --> 00:09:20,042
But I mean, I do think that even experiences like these

211
00:09:20,042 --> 00:09:21,423
can benefit from thinking critically

212
00:09:21,423 --> 00:09:23,284
about the intersection of gender and power

213
00:09:23,284 --> 00:09:24,525
in the way that we tried to do.

214
00:09:25,122 --> 00:09:29,086
I thought maybe we could talk a little bit here today about being a queen, playing as

215
00:09:29,086 --> 00:09:33,990
a lady boss, you know, the work of advocacy and how this all sticks to the often icky

216
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:37,554
and misshapen world of video game culture, because I don't know, for some reason I cannot

217
00:09:37,554 --> 00:09:39,635
stop shitting in that particular bowl of cornflakes.

218
00:09:41,395 --> 00:09:44,158
Anyway, here we have Cersei Lannister from Game of Thrones.

219
00:09:44,158 --> 00:09:45,679
Now, Cersei is a bad queen.

220
00:09:45,679 --> 00:09:47,340
She is a bad feminist.

221
00:09:47,340 --> 00:09:49,282
She enacts domineering conspiracies

222
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:51,484
against people that are rooted in her own bitterness.

223
00:09:51,484 --> 00:09:54,206
She's not even particularly savvy about it.

224
00:09:54,206 --> 00:09:56,268
She brute forces all her maneuvers.

225
00:09:56,268 --> 00:09:58,890
Feeling powerful is the only thing she cares about,

226
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:01,131
and as such, she can constantly prioritize

227
00:10:01,131 --> 00:10:04,034
a short-term gratification for long-term strategy.

228
00:10:04,034 --> 00:10:05,415
Any indignity that comes her way,

229
00:10:05,415 --> 00:10:07,317
this bee throws everything she has at it.

230
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:09,502
And I love this character.

231
00:10:09,502 --> 00:10:12,206
I would have made a whole game just about being her

232
00:10:12,206 --> 00:10:14,588
if I thought people would be OK with being that hateable.

233
00:10:14,588 --> 00:10:17,592
This is just such a plausible idea

234
00:10:17,592 --> 00:10:20,175
for a queen who has acutely felt all the ways

235
00:10:20,175 --> 00:10:22,758
that being a woman has held her back from her desires.

236
00:10:22,758 --> 00:10:24,940
She's so preoccupied by all of this, she's

237
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:27,262
hooking up with her own twin brother.

238
00:10:27,262 --> 00:10:30,064
She's that in love with the idea of a boy version of herself.

239
00:10:30,064 --> 00:10:31,745
In her selfish world, that's all her brother is.

240
00:10:31,745 --> 00:10:34,448
Meanwhile, he's probably killed way more people than she has,

241
00:10:34,448 --> 00:10:38,111
including betraying his king, which is a serious crime.

242
00:10:38,111 --> 00:10:40,233
And the fact that everyone hates her brother

243
00:10:40,233 --> 00:10:42,615
has not interfered at all with his success.

244
00:10:42,615 --> 00:10:44,336
Even people who hate him admire him,

245
00:10:44,336 --> 00:10:45,998
while by following the same rules,

246
00:10:45,998 --> 00:10:48,060
people want to see her get taken down.

247
00:10:48,060 --> 00:10:50,362
So yeah, she's what you call a trash garbage human.

248
00:10:50,721 --> 00:10:57,411
but she is a great character because her story exemplifies the toxic role that gender can play in power.

249
00:10:57,411 --> 00:11:01,017
When we conflate a good character with one who is ideologically pure,

250
00:11:01,413 --> 00:11:03,534
we risk saying that even in fiction,

251
00:11:03,534 --> 00:11:05,996
some types of characters necessarily have limitations

252
00:11:05,996 --> 00:11:07,276
that others don't.

253
00:11:07,276 --> 00:11:09,657
And for me, the thing that made Cersei's decision

254
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:12,278
so interesting was the fact that she had no choice

255
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:15,720
but to make them alongside, around, and even using men.

256
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,521
As everyone in the story loves to point out to her,

257
00:11:18,521 --> 00:11:19,742
Cersei is not the queen.

258
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,843
She's the king's wife, and even the king's mother.

259
00:11:22,843 --> 00:11:24,444
And from that indirect role, she had

260
00:11:24,444 --> 00:11:27,105
to be so much cleverer and more of a survivor

261
00:11:27,105 --> 00:11:29,927
than she would have been if she had just

262
00:11:29,927 --> 00:11:31,087
been a regular old monarch.

263
00:11:31,758 --> 00:11:34,739
Let's move on to Beyonce, the great queen.

264
00:11:34,739 --> 00:11:36,720
Actually, this slide is not, unfortunately,

265
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:37,620
is not about Beyonce.

266
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,362
I just thought you'd rather see her than Cersei.

267
00:11:41,362 --> 00:11:43,323
As I was saying, I wanted the Reigns queen

268
00:11:43,323 --> 00:11:46,865
to have the same range of grotesque, silly, thirsty,

269
00:11:46,865 --> 00:11:50,426
ruthless, vain, loving choices for the player

270
00:11:50,426 --> 00:11:53,347
as the Reigns king did, without uncritically celebrating

271
00:11:53,347 --> 00:11:54,268
traditional power.

272
00:11:54,268 --> 00:11:55,488
And in a way that I thought.

273
00:11:55,795 --> 00:12:01,278
could really let me kind of tap into that tireless manipulative agility of a character like Cersei.

274
00:12:01,278 --> 00:12:05,640
So I thought, let's shift the locus of power in the game just a little bit for Her Majesty.

275
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:10,142
You're the queen, but like Cersei, you're not on the throne, you're the king's wife.

276
00:12:10,142 --> 00:12:13,004
You'd like to have the same kind of power and freedom as the king,

277
00:12:13,004 --> 00:12:16,946
but you're surrounded by sabotage, incompetence, double standards,

278
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:21,068
men who are half as qualified as you, yet receive twice as much respect.

279
00:12:21,556 --> 00:12:25,803
I wanted the player to feel at times like the only voice of reason in a despairing kingdom

280
00:12:25,803 --> 00:12:30,751
of fools because that's an interesting kind of power that is difficult for women to assert.

281
00:12:31,887 --> 00:12:34,209
So as I was saying, I came up with this whole political

282
00:12:34,209 --> 00:12:36,550
rationale for why you play as the king's wife instead of as

283
00:12:36,550 --> 00:12:37,351
a woman ruler.

284
00:12:37,351 --> 00:12:41,014
But the larger reason for this decision was mainly to enable

285
00:12:41,014 --> 00:12:43,176
some of the kinds of narrative beats that I wanted to write.

286
00:12:43,176 --> 00:12:45,878
You know, a ruler has to make decisions about whether to

287
00:12:45,878 --> 00:12:47,259
build a dam or not.

288
00:12:47,259 --> 00:12:50,562
A lot of the reign's king's decisions were stat management

289
00:12:50,562 --> 00:12:51,202
of the land.

290
00:12:51,202 --> 00:12:53,985
But really, I was kind of more attracted to the idea of

291
00:12:53,985 --> 00:12:56,667
managing the kingdom via social intrigue and sideways

292
00:12:56,667 --> 00:12:58,648
influence and making moves behind the scenes.

293
00:12:59,137 --> 00:13:01,418
Now, that is not to say, oh, men fight with swords

294
00:13:01,418 --> 00:13:03,999
and women use words and feelings.

295
00:13:03,999 --> 00:13:06,700
You know, any time I have been interested in simply

296
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,961
new mechanics that are perhaps more story-driven and slightly

297
00:13:09,961 --> 00:13:12,122
less concerned with violence or conventional power,

298
00:13:12,122 --> 00:13:13,843
people are like, oh, so just talking,

299
00:13:13,843 --> 00:13:15,564
solving problems by talking.

300
00:13:15,564 --> 00:13:17,985
Because men fight and women talk, supposedly.

301
00:13:17,985 --> 00:13:20,706
And that stark conclusion that people jump to, for me,

302
00:13:20,706 --> 00:13:21,867
miscarries the point.

303
00:13:21,867 --> 00:13:24,328
When you don't have access to conventional power,

304
00:13:24,328 --> 00:13:26,589
you have to make more complicated and more personal

305
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,569
choices in conflict.

306
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:32,062
It's sometimes more interesting when you don't have as much control as you want.

307
00:13:32,062 --> 00:13:36,604
So let's say in Reigns, Her Majesty, if you find the life of a king's wife and a church

308
00:13:36,604 --> 00:13:40,346
figurehead demeaning and confining, and you probably will, you have to shake things up

309
00:13:40,346 --> 00:13:45,048
through unconventional means, you know, dark bargains, ambiguous righteousness, self-service,

310
00:13:45,048 --> 00:13:49,090
using people who trust you, all while making sure you're viewed as lovable and powerful

311
00:13:49,090 --> 00:13:50,691
and fun in the acceptable way.

312
00:13:51,153 --> 00:13:53,374
Those kinds of dynamics are conflict.

313
00:13:53,374 --> 00:13:55,935
They are full of violence, conflict, and cruelty,

314
00:13:55,935 --> 00:13:57,255
and tough choices, and messiness.

315
00:13:57,255 --> 00:14:00,756
And I think we do those types of mechanics a disservice

316
00:14:00,756 --> 00:14:03,437
when we reduce them to, oh, just talking it out.

317
00:14:03,437 --> 00:14:05,438
Also, that being said, we did use poetry

318
00:14:05,438 --> 00:14:06,679
for our dual mechanics.

319
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,299
The team thought that would be fun.

320
00:14:08,299 --> 00:14:11,140
So these ideas about the narrative

321
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,961
emerged for me most of all not from outside influences,

322
00:14:13,961 --> 00:14:15,902
but from the native systems themselves.

323
00:14:16,495 --> 00:14:18,016
This concept that's innate to Reigns,

324
00:14:18,016 --> 00:14:20,398
that you're constantly trying to please

325
00:14:20,398 --> 00:14:22,119
multiple irreconcilable goods,

326
00:14:22,119 --> 00:14:23,820
you can't always say what you'd really like

327
00:14:23,820 --> 00:14:26,002
because you can't statistically afford it,

328
00:14:26,002 --> 00:14:28,144
takes lifetimes to eke out progress,

329
00:14:28,144 --> 00:14:30,806
that just felt like a pretty natural field

330
00:14:30,806 --> 00:14:32,647
in which to stage an experience

331
00:14:32,647 --> 00:14:34,148
about being a woman trying to gain

332
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,789
any kind of power for herself,

333
00:14:35,789 --> 00:14:37,451
no matter what your definition of power is.

334
00:14:38,672 --> 00:14:42,294
So the original Reign's dynamic, where people were constantly coming to you with needs,

335
00:14:42,294 --> 00:14:45,415
was, as you can imagine, pretty fruitful to work with.

336
00:14:45,415 --> 00:14:49,496
And I saw a great opportunity to build a non-linear narrative experience

337
00:14:49,496 --> 00:14:53,518
of just those thousands of moments where your objectives and your desires,

338
00:14:53,518 --> 00:14:56,339
whether for yourself or your kingdom, naturally conflict.

339
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,681
I thought maybe Reign's Her Majesty could go a little further than the first game

340
00:15:00,681 --> 00:15:04,442
just in terms of an interactive fiction experience, which is my personal favorite genre.

341
00:15:05,041 --> 00:15:08,744
I thought that deepening our storytelling could invite and entertain players who were

342
00:15:08,744 --> 00:15:12,847
not necessarily systems thinkers and that even those who didn't want to dig into the

343
00:15:12,847 --> 00:15:16,650
item quests and the mysteries and the hardcore bits, because some Reigns fans are very hardcore

344
00:15:16,650 --> 00:15:20,814
so we had to account for them, but other people I wanted to also just have a lot of fun telling

345
00:15:20,814 --> 00:15:23,816
the stories of all these different queens and seeing the possibilities.

346
00:15:23,816 --> 00:15:29,180
Now before I dig a little deeper I'm not going to spend a huge amount of time on the technical

347
00:15:29,180 --> 00:15:33,764
bits because we need to focus on the pure white hot advocacy that I'm beaming out into

348
00:15:33,764 --> 00:15:34,104
this room.

349
00:15:35,317 --> 00:15:39,179
But people do ask me all the time how I approach writing these modular stories.

350
00:15:39,179 --> 00:15:43,522
And by modular, I mean the way that individual and even unrelated cards hopefully tend to

351
00:15:43,522 --> 00:15:46,804
always coalesce somewhat into miniature arcs for each reign.

352
00:15:46,804 --> 00:15:51,547
The answer to that is really, it's as much about how we balanced it as it was about how

353
00:15:51,547 --> 00:15:52,728
I wrote it.

354
00:15:52,728 --> 00:15:57,230
So real quick, I wrote individual cards, had to create the moment within the length of

355
00:15:57,230 --> 00:16:01,713
a tweet, and each card had to offer diametric expressive choices, as well as clue the player

356
00:16:01,713 --> 00:16:03,374
about the potential effect of those choices.

357
00:16:03,908 --> 00:16:06,772
And then I had to decide the result of those choices.

358
00:16:06,772 --> 00:16:08,874
So every card has a weight, a probability

359
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:10,737
which determines how likely it is to appear.

360
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:13,561
I suggested the statistical impacts of choices,

361
00:16:13,561 --> 00:16:16,263
as well as link them up to other cards that could appear

362
00:16:16,263 --> 00:16:18,123
as certain consequences later.

363
00:16:18,123 --> 00:16:20,564
So in addition to just having writing at my disposal

364
00:16:20,564 --> 00:16:22,225
as a utility, I could also decide

365
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:24,386
how this network of probabilities performed.

366
00:16:24,386 --> 00:16:27,227
The words you read are only half of the narrative experience.

367
00:16:27,227 --> 00:16:31,309
It's also about how it feels and behaves, how it's paced.

368
00:16:31,309 --> 00:16:33,950
And luckily, I had expressive tools at my disposal,

369
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:36,131
the system that Francois Alliot created,

370
00:16:36,131 --> 00:16:37,412
which he used to make rains.

371
00:16:37,412 --> 00:16:38,532
This is where I wrote the game.

372
00:16:38,532 --> 00:16:39,553
It's in Google Sheets.

373
00:16:41,110 --> 00:16:43,452
Not sure how well you can see it, but as you can see,

374
00:16:43,452 --> 00:16:45,714
we have the ability to designate the bearer

375
00:16:45,714 --> 00:16:48,116
who appears on the card, what the questions they ask,

376
00:16:48,116 --> 00:16:50,918
conditions that are relevant to the card's appearance,

377
00:16:50,918 --> 00:16:53,020
statistical effects, and then other outcomes,

378
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,282
like let's say a certain decision adds something

379
00:16:55,282 --> 00:16:57,964
to the deck or sets a new permanent condition.

380
00:16:57,964 --> 00:16:59,525
People have asked, oh, you should make

381
00:16:59,525 --> 00:17:01,627
a Reigns card game with physical cards,

382
00:17:01,627 --> 00:17:04,229
but hopefully this illustrates that that would probably,

383
00:17:04,229 --> 00:17:06,731
in my view, be difficult, because it's not the cards,

384
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:08,753
it's the system in which the cards are performing.

385
00:17:09,244 --> 00:17:14,187
So I could essentially use these numbers as well as words as tools to construct the story.

386
00:17:14,187 --> 00:17:18,649
The statistical impact of something you do in the game gives you narrative information.

387
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:23,211
To use a heavy-handed example, let's say in this world there's a contentious relationship

388
00:17:23,211 --> 00:17:25,832
between the church and practitioners of magic.

389
00:17:25,832 --> 00:17:30,215
And that could be communicated numerically by watching the numbers on the church decline

390
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,836
when you do something that feels magical or feels rebellious.

391
00:17:32,836 --> 00:17:38,078
So even though that was a statistical assignation, it was something I could use for narrative expression.

392
00:17:39,039 --> 00:17:43,980
As a team, Francois had to do a lot of balancing for me because I count on my fingers.

393
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,062
So we did a lot of adjustments as a team to balance the game and make sure it felt the

394
00:17:49,062 --> 00:17:52,102
way it was supposed to feel, the gating was working properly.

395
00:17:52,102 --> 00:17:56,743
Hopefully everyone's experience is different, every rain is different, there's a progression

396
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:58,044
but every rain is still different.

397
00:17:58,044 --> 00:18:03,525
There are hopefully lots of harmonious and happy accidents and hopefully it becomes transparent

398
00:18:03,525 --> 00:18:06,786
enough that you feel a sense of direction but not so much that it's predictable.

399
00:18:07,923 --> 00:18:11,365
Ultimately, I liken it to doing knitting in a spreadsheet,

400
00:18:11,365 --> 00:18:12,885
starting with moments and conflicts

401
00:18:12,885 --> 00:18:14,026
that I wanted the player to feel

402
00:18:14,026 --> 00:18:15,446
and then making them link up,

403
00:18:15,446 --> 00:18:17,788
reference one another and loop back.

404
00:18:17,788 --> 00:18:20,449
In a way, it was a lot like an IF authoring tool

405
00:18:20,449 --> 00:18:23,190
because all the great ones used the language of weaving,

406
00:18:23,190 --> 00:18:25,911
like a knot or a skein or a thread, a twine, you know.

407
00:18:25,911 --> 00:18:28,713
So great, we have this system

408
00:18:28,713 --> 00:18:30,633
that can very effectively make you feel.

409
00:18:30,963 --> 00:18:34,067
put upon, disempowered, and overwhelmed by choices.

410
00:18:34,067 --> 00:18:36,950
And that inspired me to make a game about how hard it

411
00:18:36,950 --> 00:18:38,672
is to be taken seriously as a woman,

412
00:18:38,672 --> 00:18:40,674
so that anyone who picks this up gets the chance

413
00:18:40,674 --> 00:18:42,135
to experience that.

414
00:18:42,135 --> 00:18:45,659
Get me my Feminist Advocate Award, right?

415
00:18:45,659 --> 00:18:49,023
So although I have always been a great believer

416
00:18:49,023 --> 00:18:50,945
in the strength of interactive environments

417
00:18:50,945 --> 00:18:52,487
to help shift people's perspectives.

418
00:18:52,726 --> 00:18:57,209
Thanks to the great critical writings and games of designers like Robert Yang and Anthropy,

419
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:01,512
I've come to strongly believe that simply reproducing an oppressive system so that others

420
00:19:01,512 --> 00:19:06,175
can experience how horrible it is, is not a sufficiently constructive way to approach

421
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:06,635
our work.

422
00:19:06,635 --> 00:19:11,198
I think the options that we give players for how to consider or act on those experiences

423
00:19:11,198 --> 00:19:12,279
are much more important.

424
00:19:12,279 --> 00:19:18,062
So even though I was conscious of the expectations that Reign's Her Majesty should at least be

425
00:19:18,062 --> 00:19:20,904
trying its best to be a feminist work, and I'll get back to that in a bit.

426
00:19:21,262 --> 00:19:25,604
The social challenges that the Queen faces are hopefully only a catalyst for a broader

427
00:19:25,604 --> 00:19:27,304
and more ambiguous dialogue.

428
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:29,065
Again, the system is horrible, we get it.

429
00:19:29,065 --> 00:19:33,768
Anguished portrayals of how bad it is for women or people of color or otherwise marginalized

430
00:19:33,768 --> 00:19:36,589
individuals make white guys feel like they're being enlightened.

431
00:19:36,589 --> 00:19:41,131
But for the rest of us on our end, I think we're all much more interested in how folks

432
00:19:41,131 --> 00:19:45,293
like ourselves cope within the system, how we comfort each other, how we prevail, and

433
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:46,193
even how we act out.

434
00:19:47,312 --> 00:19:50,816
So basically, rather than write things that happen to the queen, the real story is in

435
00:19:50,816 --> 00:19:52,337
how she can respond.

436
00:19:52,337 --> 00:19:57,041
Generally, we give yes or no choices because those are most functional from a design standpoint.

437
00:19:57,041 --> 00:19:59,243
Players tend to sometimes swipe without reading.

438
00:19:59,243 --> 00:20:01,065
They've known one way is yes and one way is no.

439
00:20:01,065 --> 00:20:05,469
But we went for tonal variety where possible, just because sometimes it's so much fun to

440
00:20:05,469 --> 00:20:06,770
emphatically say nope.

441
00:20:07,212 --> 00:20:09,434
instead of no to some incompetent guy.

442
00:20:09,434 --> 00:20:12,195
And all the guys in Reigns for Majesty are incompetent.

443
00:20:12,195 --> 00:20:13,796
Like, every character is ridiculous,

444
00:20:13,796 --> 00:20:15,738
but the dudes are especially so.

445
00:20:15,738 --> 00:20:19,140
And I gave them all, like, really ridiculous names,

446
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:21,101
because fuck it.

447
00:20:21,101 --> 00:20:22,182
Thank you.

448
00:20:22,182 --> 00:20:24,403
I also tried wherever possible to make sure

449
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,945
that the binary choices were more nuanced

450
00:20:26,945 --> 00:20:30,407
than accept this or reject it, or be nice or be mean.

451
00:20:30,407 --> 00:20:33,029
I hope that Reigns 2 would also invite players

452
00:20:33,029 --> 00:20:34,010
to consider things like.

453
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:37,223
when it's appropriate to set boundaries versus tolerate,

454
00:20:37,223 --> 00:20:39,626
whether it's better to be generous or self-serving,

455
00:20:39,626 --> 00:20:43,130
or whether generosity itself can sometimes be self-serving.

456
00:20:43,130 --> 00:20:45,312
You know, I did not actually make the queen's husband

457
00:20:45,312 --> 00:20:47,254
the king an abusive or tyrannical ruler.

458
00:20:47,254 --> 00:20:49,557
He's mostly like a clueless one who's in your way

459
00:20:49,557 --> 00:20:50,738
and doesn't take you seriously,

460
00:20:50,738 --> 00:20:53,261
but you can be tender to him sometimes if you want.

461
00:20:53,261 --> 00:20:54,723
It's like being married to Homer Simpson.

462
00:20:56,348 --> 00:20:58,449
So a good queen tries to please all her people.

463
00:20:58,449 --> 00:21:01,310
Most people tell me, and again, especially my woman friends,

464
00:21:01,310 --> 00:21:03,512
I keep dying because people love me too much.

465
00:21:03,512 --> 00:21:05,533
I keep being trampled by my adoring fans

466
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,234
because we are taught to do labor

467
00:21:07,234 --> 00:21:08,914
that makes other people feel good.

468
00:21:08,914 --> 00:21:11,236
So a good queen tries to please all her people,

469
00:21:11,236 --> 00:21:12,977
but there are a number of moments in the game

470
00:21:12,977 --> 00:21:14,778
that people pleasing for its own sake

471
00:21:14,778 --> 00:21:15,898
leads to consequences.

472
00:21:15,898 --> 00:21:18,019
A lot of people say dying because everyone loves you

473
00:21:18,019 --> 00:21:19,080
is the most common death,

474
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:21,221
and I think that's probably an intentional result

475
00:21:21,221 --> 00:21:22,822
of the way we balanced it.

476
00:21:24,121 --> 00:21:27,485
And there are moments in the game that you cannot unlock without being self-involved

477
00:21:27,485 --> 00:21:28,887
or without hoarding wealth.

478
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:33,452
And that's not so much about empowering cruelty as it is about looking at the circumstances

479
00:21:33,452 --> 00:21:35,034
in which cruelty flourishes.

480
00:21:35,034 --> 00:21:39,559
I also included a few other concepts that I thought would create an environment to kind

481
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,341
of play with the issues we've been talking about.

482
00:21:41,685 --> 00:21:49,767
The queen gets involved with various magical women, which hopefully taps into the idea that magic has been a form of resistance for oppressed people since the beginning of time.

483
00:21:49,767 --> 00:21:54,989
But I mean, if she's the queen, who is royalty, how entitled to that vocabulary is she really?

484
00:21:54,989 --> 00:21:57,629
Are there going to be consequences for her if she misappropriates it?

485
00:21:57,629 --> 00:22:02,531
So although you play through the lives of many different queens who share the same soul,

486
00:22:02,531 --> 00:22:07,992
the one trait that she always has is that she's not from the kingdom from when she's come in order to get married.

487
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:11,473
Like giving her some outsider status gives her something of a place to connect.

488
00:22:11,810 --> 00:22:16,591
with the other characters in her kingdom who feel a sense of unrest under this gilded patriarchy.

489
00:22:16,591 --> 00:22:20,591
And we have some romance options. They're small but they're important to people. Hopefully

490
00:22:20,591 --> 00:22:24,532
developing those more soon. You can be super gay in the game if you want and there's an

491
00:22:24,532 --> 00:22:28,593
achievement for if you manage to get something going on with all four romance options in

492
00:22:28,593 --> 00:22:33,873
one reign. I hope that we can maybe bring that number up a bit. Why not?

493
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:40,615
So as I've been saying, if we made a game that primarily rewarded obedience or generosity

494
00:22:40,615 --> 00:22:41,275
or being good.

495
00:22:41,543 --> 00:22:44,424
and where we punish queens for being sloppy or self-indulgent

496
00:22:44,424 --> 00:22:46,845
or horny, then we still suggest that there

497
00:22:46,845 --> 00:22:49,686
is one single ideal route to power for women.

498
00:22:49,686 --> 00:22:51,767
I didn't want to make statements on power.

499
00:22:51,767 --> 00:22:54,687
I did not want to fricking yass queen this game.

500
00:22:54,687 --> 00:22:57,408
I wanted, honestly, to explore a lot of these questions

501
00:22:57,408 --> 00:23:00,329
about my own privilege, as well as being, at the same time,

502
00:23:00,329 --> 00:23:01,409
a woman who wants change.

503
00:23:01,409 --> 00:23:03,970
I wanted to create a flexible and nuanced environment

504
00:23:03,970 --> 00:23:04,370
for this.

505
00:23:04,885 --> 00:23:09,026
You know, for example, the internet always says that self-care should be our first priority.

506
00:23:09,026 --> 00:23:11,666
The better to have resources available for others.

507
00:23:11,666 --> 00:23:16,167
But in a decadent kingdom collapsing under unstable wealth, we can rationalize almost

508
00:23:16,167 --> 00:23:17,607
anything as self-care.

509
00:23:17,607 --> 00:23:21,408
And in light of that, is it always for all of us going to be a constructive choice or

510
00:23:21,408 --> 00:23:22,629
just a constant temptation?

511
00:23:22,629 --> 00:23:26,109
Do I just want to feel good about the fact that I bought all these fucking gold sheet

512
00:23:26,109 --> 00:23:27,049
masks?

513
00:23:27,049 --> 00:23:30,950
I mean, these questions are what I wanted to express in the game.

514
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:33,891
Basically, when you design an oppressive system...

515
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:37,220
and also designed for the equally powerful desire

516
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:39,881
to escape that system or to gain individual power

517
00:23:39,881 --> 00:23:41,841
as a disadvantaged person, you create

518
00:23:41,841 --> 00:23:44,882
a lot of complicated space.

519
00:23:44,882 --> 00:23:47,362
I really love what my interactive fiction idol, Emily

520
00:23:47,362 --> 00:23:50,683
Short, had to say about the feminism in the game.

521
00:23:50,683 --> 00:23:52,303
I definitely did set out to make fun

522
00:23:52,303 --> 00:23:55,484
of a certain brand of feminism and the commercialization

523
00:23:55,484 --> 00:23:59,504
thereof, but only as one of many ambiguously helpful routes

524
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,645
for women trying to figure out how to make their most

525
00:24:01,645 --> 00:24:03,265
ethical way in the world.

526
00:24:04,656 --> 00:24:05,116
I don't know.

527
00:24:05,116 --> 00:24:09,877
I mean, after some of the experiences I had in video games,

528
00:24:09,877 --> 00:24:11,758
especially trying to have a voice in the consumer space,

529
00:24:11,758 --> 00:24:14,939
I came away suspicious of the very idea

530
00:24:14,939 --> 00:24:17,279
that we could make a video game feminist

531
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:19,080
simply by having people play as a girl,

532
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,320
or anti-racist simply because it has representation.

533
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,061
What I'm about to say may shock you,

534
00:24:24,061 --> 00:24:26,201
but writing Reigns, Her Majesty was a job,

535
00:24:26,201 --> 00:24:28,002
which I did for money.

536
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,262
I did it because I trusted the team

537
00:24:29,262 --> 00:24:31,083
and I had something to say, sure.

538
00:24:31,083 --> 00:24:31,883
But at the end of the day,

539
00:24:31,883 --> 00:24:34,303
have I done advocacy or did I work on an app?

540
00:24:34,581 --> 00:24:38,607
You know, if you played Raids Her Majesty extensively, then you might know that there

541
00:24:38,607 --> 00:24:43,454
is some meta-narrative I attempted to put in there about how suspicious I am of companies

542
00:24:43,454 --> 00:24:46,359
celebrating women's experiences for money.

543
00:24:46,359 --> 00:24:50,045
So if you've seen some weird loose threads to pull out in there, that's what those are.

544
00:24:50,427 --> 00:24:57,989
sort of leading toward. And I'm so lucky to get to speak at GDC in the first place, to advance my own ideas and to access new opportunities.

545
00:24:57,989 --> 00:25:01,851
But obviously, as if we could forget, this event is out of reach of most developers.

546
00:25:01,851 --> 00:25:07,412
My colleague Rami Ismail, he's now running the One Reason to Be panel that Brenda Romero and I used to do.

547
00:25:07,772 --> 00:25:12,377
And Rami has been trying to, we started out just celebrating women and now we welcome,

548
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:15,740
the panel welcomes all kinds of perspectives and expertise that have been marginalized

549
00:25:15,740 --> 00:25:17,361
in the traditional industry, which I think is ideal.

550
00:25:17,361 --> 00:25:22,366
But over the past several months, Rami's been having a really hard time having to repeatedly

551
00:25:22,366 --> 00:25:25,569
deal with visa rejections for the speakers that he wanted to bring here.

552
00:25:25,569 --> 00:25:28,151
It just sounds like it's been heartbreaking for everyone involved.

553
00:25:28,151 --> 00:25:32,235
So there's a lot of, always a lot of questions to be asked about our participation.

554
00:25:32,562 --> 00:25:35,304
in these ecosystems about being here in San Francisco,

555
00:25:35,304 --> 00:25:38,906
who really materially benefits from expanding our audiences

556
00:25:38,906 --> 00:25:41,668
and marketing this idea of ourselves as progressive?

557
00:25:41,668 --> 00:25:43,829
Like, have I been doing advocacy in this room,

558
00:25:43,829 --> 00:25:45,971
or did I just give a narrative design talk?

559
00:25:45,971 --> 00:25:48,573
Like, am I an advocate talking at my expensive industry

560
00:25:48,573 --> 00:25:50,934
conference about my queen video game?

561
00:25:50,934 --> 00:25:51,855
Am I even adequate?

562
00:25:51,855 --> 00:25:52,495
I don't know.

563
00:25:53,190 --> 00:25:56,111
And for me, that is more of an interesting narrative

564
00:25:56,111 --> 00:25:57,912
and thematic space for me to be working in.

565
00:25:57,912 --> 00:26:00,313
It's more interesting than any number

566
00:26:00,313 --> 00:26:02,814
of slay queen empowerment fantasies.

567
00:26:02,814 --> 00:26:05,015
Maybe it can be more interesting to you too.

568
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:06,956
Please pay me to write your games.

569
00:26:06,956 --> 00:26:07,916
Thank you.

570
00:26:07,916 --> 00:26:08,177
Thank you.

571
00:26:08,177 --> 00:26:08,737
Thank you so much.

572
00:26:08,737 --> 00:26:09,057
Thank you.

573
00:26:09,057 --> 00:26:10,257
Thank you so much.

574
00:26:10,257 --> 00:26:10,678
Thank you.

575
00:26:10,678 --> 00:26:11,378
Thank you so much.

576
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:11,658
Thank you.

577
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:12,779
Thank you.

578
00:26:12,779 --> 00:26:13,579
Thank you.

579
00:26:13,579 --> 00:26:14,059
Thank you.

580
00:26:14,059 --> 00:26:14,439
Thank you.

581
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:14,880
And thank you, David.

582
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:18,261
Thank you.

583
00:26:18,261 --> 00:26:18,701
Thank you.

584
00:26:18,701 --> 00:26:21,523
Thank you.

585
00:26:21,523 --> 00:26:21,743
Thank you.

586
00:26:22,977 --> 00:26:25,681
I don't think I left any time for questions.

587
00:26:25,681 --> 00:26:28,965
I think that's the end of my time, right?

588
00:26:28,965 --> 00:26:30,387
Yeah?

589
00:26:30,387 --> 00:26:33,130
Four minutes?

590
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,873
Oh yeah, people can ask a couple questions if they're short.

591
00:26:35,873 --> 00:26:37,916
If anyone would like to come up to the mic.

592
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:46,938
Hello. Hi. So my question I guess would be, do you feel like there is something wrong with the

593
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:52,681
Ask Queen empowerment fantasy because you know sometimes you really just do need to escape into that?

594
00:26:52,681 --> 00:26:58,664
Well no, I think it's it's it would be wrong to dismiss any kind of person's fantasy unilaterally

595
00:26:58,664 --> 00:27:03,886
um but what I mean specifically is the branded and marketed version of the lean-in brand of

596
00:27:03,886 --> 00:27:05,267
corporate women's empowerment.

597
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:10,251
Like, you know, if I had a daughter, I would have bigger dreams for her than to become

598
00:27:10,251 --> 00:27:12,151
like a capitalist shit lord.

599
00:27:12,151 --> 00:27:13,292
You know what I mean?

600
00:27:13,292 --> 00:27:14,012
Thank you.

601
00:27:14,012 --> 00:27:14,252
Thank you.

602
00:27:14,252 --> 00:27:17,493
So yeah, of course, yes, Queen is fine, but let's not like purchase the hats, you know?

603
00:27:17,493 --> 00:27:18,433
Anybody else?

604
00:27:18,433 --> 00:27:18,553
Hi.

605
00:27:18,553 --> 00:27:23,594
So you made a point about the idea of an oppressive system versus one that you can

606
00:27:35,009 --> 00:27:40,913
subvert and change in games and how we maybe need more narratives about people overcoming their

607
00:27:40,913 --> 00:27:45,096
problems. But how do you feel about games as a reflective tool in that sense?

608
00:27:45,096 --> 00:27:49,759
I think it really all depends on the game. Like I said, games do have the ability to reflect

609
00:27:49,759 --> 00:27:52,600
to others experiences that they wouldn't ordinarily encounter and some of those

610
00:27:52,600 --> 00:27:57,363
have been valuable. There's people whose lives have been changed by what we call empathy games.

611
00:27:57,781 --> 00:28:03,763
But I think people that I know that work in that sector as developers eventually felt used up by that space.

612
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:06,944
That they'd served up their experiences on a platter to educate others.

613
00:28:06,944 --> 00:28:11,366
And then they did not receive any recognition or monetization of that work in any way.

614
00:28:11,366 --> 00:28:14,927
So I think, yes, it's important. Games can be a mirror.

615
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:20,589
But for the sake of the creators and their experiences, that's not enough to show people something new.

616
00:28:20,589 --> 00:28:25,210
I want to know, when you've played this empathy game, what are you going to do now about the state of the world?

617
00:28:25,210 --> 00:28:27,131
What are you going to do now about the state of the world?

618
00:28:27,585 --> 00:28:32,588
on behalf of the person who made it. So yeah, I think it's complicated. Thank you. Thank you.

619
00:28:32,588 --> 00:28:41,852
Um, okay. So I'm like a women's study major and I want to, I've been like doing a lot of

620
00:28:41,852 --> 00:28:48,434
feminism games, trying to promote feminism games like the one you have. And my biggest issue is

621
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:55,778
when all my feminist friends, they hear the word game, they're like, no. I know. It's patriarchy,

622
00:28:55,778 --> 00:28:57,418
it's violent. It's like.

623
00:28:58,308 --> 00:29:02,010
destroying people and like it's really hard for them to

624
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:09,653
Play like game like this when there's like kind of a bad reputation about what video game is

625
00:29:09,653 --> 00:29:14,134
And I wonder like if you have experience I like that and like what can we do as a game designer?

626
00:29:14,134 --> 00:29:14,335
Yes

627
00:29:14,335 --> 00:29:21,797
I have experienced that I spent I spent like the good years of my 20s trying to tell people about like

628
00:29:21,797 --> 00:29:27,780
Anti-patriarchal video games and the audience is so small and the willingness is so low and it is so depressing

629
00:29:28,130 --> 00:29:32,812
I think largely that's on the shoulders of the commercial games industry,

630
00:29:32,812 --> 00:29:36,653
which has thrived on marketing this idea of itself as, you know,

631
00:29:36,653 --> 00:29:40,555
capitalist power fantasies for white guys, you know, and I think, you know, the

632
00:29:40,555 --> 00:29:43,696
larger industry is going to need to evolve before people are willing to give

633
00:29:43,696 --> 00:29:46,637
it another chance. Now on the other hand, there's a lot of like scapegoating and

634
00:29:46,637 --> 00:29:49,479
moral panic about video games and how they like make people vi- you know,

635
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:52,340
there's a lot of stuff, the categorization of the industry that is

636
00:29:52,340 --> 00:29:53,440
unfair and unproductive.

637
00:29:53,975 --> 00:29:57,756
But I mean, yeah, I mean, absolutely, yes, I feel you.

638
00:29:57,756 --> 00:30:00,057
And if I had an answer, maybe I'd still be working

639
00:30:00,057 --> 00:30:01,778
in video games criticism.

640
00:30:01,778 --> 00:30:02,258
Thank you.

641
00:30:02,258 --> 00:30:04,039
One more, maybe?

642
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:04,999
Oh, sorry, hi.

643
00:30:04,999 --> 00:30:06,460
Two things.

644
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:08,501
One is, please stay in the industry.

645
00:30:08,501 --> 00:30:08,821
Oh.

646
00:30:08,821 --> 00:30:10,122
Oh, thank you.

647
00:30:14,442 --> 00:30:15,322
Thank you.

648
00:30:15,322 --> 00:30:18,783
It's just really good to hear this sort of advocacy.

649
00:30:18,783 --> 00:30:20,243
Thanks, it's been a lot.

650
00:30:20,243 --> 00:30:21,123
Thank you.

651
00:30:21,123 --> 00:30:26,904
So the other question is sort of about the AAA industry

652
00:30:26,904 --> 00:30:28,125
and the console industry.

653
00:30:28,125 --> 00:30:31,365
And I feel, having been in it for long enough,

654
00:30:31,365 --> 00:30:32,825
that we're getting better.

655
00:30:32,825 --> 00:30:36,546
But I don't know, being like a straight white male

656
00:30:36,546 --> 00:30:37,946
between the ages of 18 and 34, I don't know

657
00:30:37,946 --> 00:30:39,707
if that's actually a thing.

658
00:30:39,707 --> 00:30:40,987
So what's your perspective on it?

659
00:30:40,987 --> 00:30:42,367
I think it's getting better.

660
00:30:42,367 --> 00:30:42,587
I do.

661
00:30:43,739 --> 00:30:48,121
there are stuff that are shown at commercial showcases now that I wouldn't have dreamed of

662
00:30:48,121 --> 00:30:52,983
seeing when I was young and starting out. It felt like a very hostile space to me when I was starting

663
00:30:52,983 --> 00:30:57,684
out. And now, you know, some of it just, it still feels like, you know, there's a lot more progress

664
00:30:57,684 --> 00:31:02,406
to be made. But I actually, I do think it's getting better. I really do. Maybe I'm being

665
00:31:02,406 --> 00:31:07,228
naive, but I think it is possible for it to get better. And I think it has been.

666
00:31:07,228 --> 00:31:08,988
Thank you. I think that's all my time.

667
00:31:08,988 --> 00:31:11,930
Thank you.
