1
00:00:06,092 --> 00:00:08,692
OK, so welcome, everybody.

2
00:00:08,772 --> 00:00:09,813
It's very crowdy.

3
00:00:11,733 --> 00:00:15,934
And I'm very happy to show you an overview of the hard

4
00:00:15,954 --> 00:00:17,915
direction and the production pipeline we

5
00:00:18,035 --> 00:00:20,995
use to create Heavy Rain.

6
00:00:23,116 --> 00:00:27,257
Being there, talking from this side of the desk

7
00:00:27,377 --> 00:00:29,137
gives a lot of emotion.

8
00:00:30,238 --> 00:00:33,238
And it's quite a good thing, because at a

9
00:00:34,038 --> 00:00:36,019
Quantic, we really love emotion.

10
00:00:37,721 --> 00:00:40,803
So the title of this session is How

11
00:00:40,863 --> 00:00:45,327
Heart Was Used to Create a Unique Cinematic Experience.

12
00:00:47,369 --> 00:00:51,732
So just remember a few words of this title,

13
00:00:51,993 --> 00:00:54,154
Create a Unique Experience.

14
00:00:54,855 --> 00:00:56,776
Because when we start Heavy Rain,

15
00:00:57,377 --> 00:01:01,500
it was really in our mind, not just making a good game,

16
00:01:02,121 --> 00:01:03,662
but creating an experience.

17
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:05,681
Sometimes it succeeds.

18
00:01:06,561 --> 00:01:07,782
Sometimes it fails.

19
00:01:13,523 --> 00:01:18,584
So first, let's talk about Quantic.

20
00:01:19,044 --> 00:01:23,946
We have been established in 1907 in France.

21
00:01:24,506 --> 00:01:30,907
So I think that my accent speaks for myself.

22
00:01:32,185 --> 00:01:38,547
We are 100 full-time employee, and we have in-house motion

23
00:01:38,587 --> 00:01:42,188
capture facility, a 3D scan, and a sound studio.

24
00:01:43,709 --> 00:01:49,611
We also develop experience based on emotion, as I already said.

25
00:01:49,631 --> 00:01:52,391
Heavy Rain is a new format.

26
00:01:52,611 --> 00:01:54,432
It's called interactive drama.

27
00:01:54,872 --> 00:01:56,993
It's a blend between film and game.

28
00:01:57,733 --> 00:02:01,114
It has been released last year exclusively on PS3.

29
00:02:05,442 --> 00:02:06,483
So who am I?

30
00:02:06,503 --> 00:02:10,805
I don't even know myself, but I can give you some key points.

31
00:02:12,186 --> 00:02:13,946
So my name is Christophe Rousseau.

32
00:02:14,427 --> 00:02:16,708
I'm the graphic director of the studio.

33
00:02:17,548 --> 00:02:24,011
And I start in the old garage game time in a company called

34
00:02:24,071 --> 00:02:26,172
Delphine Software International.

35
00:02:27,333 --> 00:02:29,034
They do flashback.

36
00:02:29,654 --> 00:02:31,975
So I joined them for the sequel.

37
00:02:33,556 --> 00:02:33,836
Thank you.

38
00:02:34,176 --> 00:02:34,757
Thank you for them.

39
00:02:36,385 --> 00:02:41,406
And I work on motor research on PC and PS1.

40
00:02:42,847 --> 00:02:46,307
I left the company to move to the movie and commercial

41
00:02:46,367 --> 00:02:46,767
industry.

42
00:02:47,628 --> 00:02:52,809
And I came back to video game as a lead set in 2001.

43
00:02:53,129 --> 00:02:58,230
And I work on Fahrenheit, The Indigo Prophecy in US,

44
00:02:58,350 --> 00:02:59,390
and on Heavy Rain.

45
00:03:09,102 --> 00:03:11,963
How many people play to Heavy Rain in this room?

46
00:03:13,984 --> 00:03:14,184
No.

47
00:03:16,644 --> 00:03:16,944
OK.

48
00:03:17,424 --> 00:03:22,566
So I will just show you a quick trailer for people

49
00:03:22,586 --> 00:03:23,946
who don't play Heavy Rain.

50
00:03:33,689 --> 00:03:36,250
Are you prepared to suffer to save your son?

51
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:38,590
You have five minutes.

52
00:03:52,022 --> 00:03:53,803
Agent Norman Jayden, FBI.

53
00:03:55,725 --> 00:03:56,045
Name me.

54
00:03:56,465 --> 00:03:58,407
My name's Scott Shelby. I'm a private detective.

55
00:03:59,087 --> 00:04:00,809
I'm investigating the case of the origami.

56
00:04:01,449 --> 00:04:01,930
I'd like a run.

57
00:04:04,632 --> 00:04:05,713
Madison Page, 27.

58
00:04:06,073 --> 00:04:06,453
Single.

59
00:04:06,474 --> 00:04:12,158
Ethan Mars has had psychological problems since his first son died.

60
00:04:12,679 --> 00:04:15,021
He is haunted by visions of drowning bodies.

61
00:04:16,322 --> 00:04:20,805
A few weeks ago, after one of our usual sessions, I found this on the floor.

62
00:04:22,647 --> 00:04:25,048
They must have pulled him out of his pocket.

63
00:04:25,068 --> 00:04:27,850
Ash, I want you to assign every available man to finding Ethan Barnes.

64
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:30,912
I want you to keep an eye on the train stations, the airports, the bus terminals.

65
00:04:31,032 --> 00:04:35,334
I want every cop in the city on his ass, so that if he moves, we know about it.

66
00:04:35,795 --> 00:04:38,876
You're gonna die, you son of a bitch!

67
00:04:38,896 --> 00:04:42,258
I swore on my son's grave that I would kill the man who murdered him.

68
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:44,740
Just don't believe he's guilty.

69
00:04:45,180 --> 00:04:47,922
Your other son was a shepherd. What was his name?

70
00:04:50,995 --> 00:04:53,397
Everything I did, I did for love.

71
00:04:57,439 --> 00:05:04,003
So it's a little bit darker, but let's go.

72
00:05:06,104 --> 00:05:09,867
Let's talk about a few main topics.

73
00:05:12,448 --> 00:05:13,709
First, the story.

74
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:18,772
After that, how we create the world of Heavy Rain.

75
00:05:20,909 --> 00:05:25,051
and the characters, how do we animate them,

76
00:05:26,632 --> 00:05:28,573
and the fifth main character.

77
00:05:33,995 --> 00:05:36,057
So what is the vision behind Heavy Rain?

78
00:05:36,797 --> 00:05:40,179
First of all, we wanted to create an experience that

79
00:05:40,339 --> 00:05:43,541
engage the player emotionally and explore

80
00:05:43,701 --> 00:05:46,642
the potential of interactive storytelling.

81
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,422
But we are also targeting a much more mature audience.

82
00:05:54,864 --> 00:05:56,245
Every Rain is a new genre.

83
00:05:56,865 --> 00:05:58,687
It's not based on challenges.

84
00:05:59,027 --> 00:06:01,789
There is no boss to beat, no solving puzzle.

85
00:06:02,289 --> 00:06:03,610
There is no game over.

86
00:06:04,591 --> 00:06:06,732
You can lose one of your main character,

87
00:06:07,073 --> 00:06:10,715
but you can still play the game and continue to discover

88
00:06:11,476 --> 00:06:13,117
the story in the way you choose.

89
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:15,358
Every Rain.

90
00:06:16,105 --> 00:06:21,849
A story is a multiple path story, so we have to write it

91
00:06:22,369 --> 00:06:26,031
and also to produce it, all the different paths.

92
00:06:31,614 --> 00:06:35,556
So some numbers, because everyone is a massive project,

93
00:06:36,997 --> 00:06:38,018
2,000 pages of script.

94
00:06:38,878 --> 00:06:43,441
It's very huge, because we have to write all the path,

95
00:06:43,761 --> 00:06:44,642
all the dialogues.

96
00:06:45,153 --> 00:06:47,194
all the gameplay, all the mechanics.

97
00:06:48,834 --> 00:06:54,557
It means 70 unique sets, four main playable characters,

98
00:06:55,517 --> 00:07:00,019
20 secondary, additional, many days of mo-cap shooting.

99
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:03,481
Hopefully, we have an in-house facility,

100
00:07:03,561 --> 00:07:06,022
so it's much more easier for us.

101
00:07:06,802 --> 00:07:09,303
Many body animation, many facial animation,

102
00:07:10,143 --> 00:07:14,385
a lot of localization, and 60 scenes.

103
00:07:22,034 --> 00:07:25,417
So Heavy Rain has a 2,000-page script.

104
00:07:26,297 --> 00:07:27,698
We start by reading it.

105
00:07:28,719 --> 00:07:31,181
And believe me, it's a huge task.

106
00:07:35,384 --> 00:07:38,066
We do an initial list of mood boards

107
00:07:38,646 --> 00:07:43,910
to identify some specific places directly taken from the script.

108
00:07:48,802 --> 00:07:54,367
We do some visual research to identify a city, a place,

109
00:07:54,848 --> 00:07:57,790
where the story can take place.

110
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:12,283
So it starts with some sketches, picture, some mood board,

111
00:08:14,004 --> 00:08:16,327
maybe some K-color board.

112
00:08:17,317 --> 00:08:21,618
Some rough art concept on some specific scene.

113
00:08:23,458 --> 00:08:24,939
Here it's the crime scene.

114
00:08:25,659 --> 00:08:28,199
I don't know if you remember, but it's

115
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,400
a huge scene in Heavy Rain.

116
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:39,042
And also color board just to under the feeling and the look

117
00:08:39,062 --> 00:08:44,303
and feel we wanted to make on Heavy Rain.

118
00:08:48,526 --> 00:08:51,267
We identify Philadelphia as a potential city,

119
00:08:55,508 --> 00:09:00,510
but we wanted to avoid doing a French postcard

120
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,871
vision of this city.

121
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:09,153
And believe me, it's hard, because I'm not

122
00:09:09,213 --> 00:09:10,954
an English-fluent guy.

123
00:09:12,394 --> 00:09:16,216
So we use a movie scoot to tour to Philadelphia.

124
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:18,117
We take a plane.

125
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:19,409
and go scooting.

126
00:09:23,331 --> 00:09:25,312
But we don't stay in the center of a city,

127
00:09:25,752 --> 00:09:26,952
the historical center.

128
00:09:27,312 --> 00:09:31,354
It's quite pretty, but it doesn't match to the script.

129
00:09:32,934 --> 00:09:35,115
We try to go deeper to the suburbs,

130
00:09:36,216 --> 00:09:39,117
from the middle class suburbs to the poor area.

131
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:44,379
The main goal was to avoid having a kind

132
00:09:44,419 --> 00:09:47,320
of ideal vision of the city.

133
00:09:54,348 --> 00:10:00,311
So by taking pictures, we identify some visual grammar.

134
00:10:00,411 --> 00:10:03,333
But I will talk about it later.

135
00:10:11,798 --> 00:10:18,161
Many picture, and sometimes some dangerous meeting.

136
00:10:20,403 --> 00:10:21,984
Because on one.

137
00:10:24,332 --> 00:10:31,875
And specifically in this picture, I remember that we were taking picture with the team

138
00:10:32,615 --> 00:10:37,937
and the scout say, go in the car.

139
00:10:38,517 --> 00:10:47,241
We don't notify that someone is coming with a gun and asking why we were taking some picture

140
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:49,262
of his district.

141
00:10:50,122 --> 00:10:54,063
So I get in the car, never left it.

142
00:10:55,354 --> 00:11:04,542
And we do all the scooting by the car and from the car.

143
00:11:07,404 --> 00:11:07,985
No, I'm kidding.

144
00:11:09,266 --> 00:11:10,987
Just for this part.

145
00:11:13,950 --> 00:11:16,412
So we also went to an industrial area

146
00:11:16,852 --> 00:11:20,916
trying to find a warehouse, whole power plants, piers.

147
00:11:21,700 --> 00:11:25,182
We also visit people living in Cape Cod.

148
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:29,943
We go to a police department, hospital, office, newspaper.

149
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:34,385
I can't put images in my slide because there

150
00:11:34,425 --> 00:11:36,005
is some privacy in there.

151
00:11:36,105 --> 00:11:45,609
But we are very proud to be able to scoot this kind of location

152
00:11:46,069 --> 00:11:48,790
because we've got to scoot.

153
00:11:50,776 --> 00:11:52,157
couldn't have been done.

154
00:12:03,343 --> 00:12:06,585
So we came back with a new understanding of a city

155
00:12:09,406 --> 00:12:10,427
and sometimes emotion.

156
00:12:14,109 --> 00:12:18,131
We have a huge documentation with many picture,

157
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,032
many video references.

158
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:27,496
We also identify what we call a visual grammar.

159
00:12:28,277 --> 00:12:32,701
I mean, I don't know if you notice in the picture,

160
00:12:33,101 --> 00:12:37,766
but there is many warehouse, bridges, electric pole,

161
00:12:38,006 --> 00:12:41,269
electric power plant, many things

162
00:12:41,609 --> 00:12:46,854
very linked to industrial, I mean, past industrial.

163
00:12:47,935 --> 00:12:49,796
So we took these elements.

164
00:12:51,555 --> 00:12:56,498
And we try to dramatize the vision,

165
00:12:57,278 --> 00:13:00,800
because Philadelphia is just an inspiration.

166
00:13:09,003 --> 00:13:11,564
Because everyone is a blend of game and movie,

167
00:13:12,385 --> 00:13:16,827
we decide to recruit a design team

168
00:13:17,187 --> 00:13:20,248
very close to the movie industry.

169
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:25,802
So set designer and architect are

170
00:13:25,842 --> 00:13:29,724
in charge of creating and building realistic location

171
00:13:30,724 --> 00:13:34,526
at human size and very precise blueprint.

172
00:13:36,186 --> 00:13:39,988
Interior designer and researcher provide a precise vision

173
00:13:40,608 --> 00:13:42,929
and documentation for the production team.

174
00:13:44,589 --> 00:13:47,070
Set concept artist are.

175
00:13:47,996 --> 00:13:49,937
in charge of illustrating the vision

176
00:13:50,017 --> 00:13:53,840
and providing final art concept, and specifically light setup.

177
00:13:55,041 --> 00:13:57,302
And the CG artists were in charge

178
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:02,706
of giving a virtual life to all these visual researchers.

179
00:14:07,449 --> 00:14:10,331
So their goals.

180
00:14:13,573 --> 00:14:17,155
First, creating realistic location at human size.

181
00:14:17,814 --> 00:14:18,915
What does it mean?

182
00:14:19,615 --> 00:14:24,378
Usually, in video games, all the location and spaces

183
00:14:24,659 --> 00:14:29,602
are very large, huge like stadium, because you know,

184
00:14:29,942 --> 00:14:34,505
we need to avoid collision issues and camera issues.

185
00:14:35,246 --> 00:14:36,426
It's easier.

186
00:14:37,507 --> 00:14:39,889
But we don't want to do that because we really

187
00:14:39,949 --> 00:14:42,790
want to be close to a movie.

188
00:14:43,971 --> 00:14:45,252
So we can't afford that.

189
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:50,516
It's also very hard to keep a realistic dimension,

190
00:14:50,556 --> 00:14:53,097
because visually, when it's wrong,

191
00:14:53,818 --> 00:14:55,478
you can see it very quickly.

192
00:15:05,983 --> 00:15:10,165
We also find visually and strong atmospheric location,

193
00:15:12,166 --> 00:15:13,687
specifically by scooting.

194
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:20,492
We also have to ensure consistency regarding

195
00:15:20,532 --> 00:15:22,233
characters and gameplay hotspot.

196
00:15:23,253 --> 00:15:28,136
Because we are talking about a game close to a movie,

197
00:15:28,316 --> 00:15:29,957
it's a blend between game and movie,

198
00:15:31,858 --> 00:15:37,461
we need to match location and characterization.

199
00:15:39,502 --> 00:15:46,626
But also, we have to manage all the gameplay hotspot.

200
00:15:47,976 --> 00:15:55,080
specifically to be able to match to the main mechanics

201
00:15:56,161 --> 00:15:56,681
and the plot.

202
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:05,546
We provide a key color on each set and scene.

203
00:16:07,647 --> 00:16:10,049
For people who play to every rain,

204
00:16:10,749 --> 00:16:14,591
they can notice that there is a huge gap between the beginning

205
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:15,111
of the game.

206
00:16:16,273 --> 00:16:20,335
and the rest of the game, I mean, before the accident

207
00:16:20,916 --> 00:16:21,576
and after.

208
00:16:22,296 --> 00:16:26,078
Before, it's very bloomy, colorful, very clean.

209
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:27,779
It's a kind of hideous life.

210
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:33,621
And on the rest of the game, every color is color wash.

211
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:35,262
It's rainy.

212
00:16:36,242 --> 00:16:37,563
There is few saturation.

213
00:16:38,223 --> 00:16:39,544
It's very diffused light.

214
00:16:40,464 --> 00:16:42,845
It's chaotic and dirty location.

215
00:16:45,126 --> 00:16:45,986
We do that.

216
00:16:46,574 --> 00:16:52,096
just to improve the feeling of the happy time versus the bad time.

217
00:16:57,699 --> 00:17:00,200
We also provide invisible storytelling.

218
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:04,662
So what is invisible storytelling?

219
00:17:04,682 --> 00:17:11,385
Imagine the first time you go to someone else's house.

220
00:17:12,486 --> 00:17:14,226
When you enter a room, you can...

221
00:17:15,589 --> 00:17:18,070
identify many things at the first sight.

222
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:23,231
Maybe it could be a huge amount of books or comics,

223
00:17:24,191 --> 00:17:29,852
baseball stuff, domestic mess, TV set or no, furniture style.

224
00:17:31,172 --> 00:17:33,853
All these elements provide you information

225
00:17:34,353 --> 00:17:35,593
on the people living here.

226
00:17:37,493 --> 00:17:40,554
This is what we try to do in Heavy Rain.

227
00:17:43,663 --> 00:17:46,866
We don't want to tell the past of a main character

228
00:17:46,946 --> 00:17:49,928
during hours of cut scene and dialogues,

229
00:17:50,469 --> 00:17:56,254
because remember, we had 2,000 page of script just

230
00:17:56,294 --> 00:17:57,115
for the main plot.

231
00:17:58,576 --> 00:18:01,959
So we try to provide visual background,

232
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:04,461
small pieces of their life.

233
00:18:12,541 --> 00:18:18,406
And also, we asked the artist to make it stunning but depressive.

234
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:30,635
The initial design has been developed in 15 months.

235
00:18:35,119 --> 00:18:36,940
So what is the design process?

236
00:18:38,021 --> 00:18:40,203
The design process is quite simple.

237
00:18:41,283 --> 00:18:46,505
we first build some sketches and blueprints for each location.

238
00:18:48,967 --> 00:18:51,728
And we need to respect the gameplay hotspot.

239
00:18:53,809 --> 00:18:56,970
We built in parallel a 3D placeholder of a set.

240
00:18:57,991 --> 00:18:59,231
It's gray boxes.

241
00:19:01,372 --> 00:19:04,674
And visual documentation package in mood boards.

242
00:19:06,175 --> 00:19:09,176
We test the 3D placeholder directly

243
00:19:09,216 --> 00:19:10,537
in real time in the engine.

244
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:14,950
And when it's validated in terms of gameplay, animation,

245
00:19:15,310 --> 00:19:20,312
camera, we can finalize the art concept and the documentation,

246
00:19:21,132 --> 00:19:24,394
package it, and it's go to production

247
00:19:24,974 --> 00:19:27,595
for outsourcing or insourcing.

248
00:19:32,357 --> 00:19:35,298
So here is some example of the blueprint.

249
00:19:36,318 --> 00:19:40,160
So remember, it has been done by architect, so it can be built.

250
00:19:41,544 --> 00:19:44,405
And sometimes we had to stop them because they

251
00:19:44,505 --> 00:19:47,826
want to add details and too realistic details,

252
00:19:47,906 --> 00:19:52,267
but saying that we need an electrical plug here,

253
00:19:52,447 --> 00:19:54,128
and we need that.

254
00:19:54,748 --> 00:19:56,788
And no, stop it.

255
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:58,569
We are making video game.

256
00:19:58,629 --> 00:20:00,189
We are not building a house.

257
00:20:03,430 --> 00:20:07,932
And also, they had a hard time when they came back

258
00:20:08,652 --> 00:20:09,872
to the movie industry.

259
00:20:10,448 --> 00:20:14,351
Because with video games, we are very strong.

260
00:20:14,551 --> 00:20:17,313
We can do anything, just in 3D.

261
00:20:18,054 --> 00:20:21,096
When they came back to the movie industry, it's hard.

262
00:20:21,676 --> 00:20:22,897
There is some budget.

263
00:20:23,798 --> 00:20:28,942
And wow, when you're trying to do an office in a church,

264
00:20:29,362 --> 00:20:30,243
you have to find it.

265
00:20:31,084 --> 00:20:32,004
You have to budget it.

266
00:20:32,465 --> 00:20:33,305
You have to build it.

267
00:20:40,005 --> 00:20:45,548
So here is some mood boards and picture references.

268
00:20:47,469 --> 00:20:51,612
They provide a huge documentation on materials

269
00:20:52,532 --> 00:20:53,693
for modeling and shading.

270
00:20:55,214 --> 00:21:00,156
It's also give to the artist some messy places reference.

271
00:21:00,857 --> 00:21:05,499
I mean that it's always hard to put some chaos in a set,

272
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,301
except in fantasy games.

273
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:16,047
But every object position has a reason in the everyday life.

274
00:21:16,968 --> 00:21:20,270
When you go home, you throw your book on the sofa,

275
00:21:20,390 --> 00:21:22,111
newspaper on the table.

276
00:21:23,092 --> 00:21:27,795
And it has a meaning.

277
00:21:29,056 --> 00:21:30,076
It needs to be real.

278
00:21:30,917 --> 00:21:37,842
So providing chaos needs to provide consistency.

279
00:21:38,818 --> 00:21:39,359
on the set.

280
00:21:47,965 --> 00:21:52,908
And we've got a precise mood board for furniture, too.

281
00:21:58,392 --> 00:22:02,335
You can see on the bottom left the gray boxes.

282
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:08,571
And here is a material board reference

283
00:22:10,392 --> 00:22:12,713
for shadows and specularity.

284
00:22:21,757 --> 00:22:25,819
And the concept art give atmosphere, key colors,

285
00:22:26,459 --> 00:22:27,719
and a light setup.

286
00:22:29,540 --> 00:22:34,242
So this concept art is taken from the Hisan House.

287
00:22:38,941 --> 00:22:40,722
This one, too, is bedroom.

288
00:22:50,210 --> 00:22:51,111
And so it goes on.

289
00:22:53,593 --> 00:22:58,217
So many, many art concepts, because we have many locations.

290
00:23:00,899 --> 00:23:05,142
And sometimes, lights setup, etc.

291
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:07,302
will change in the same location.

292
00:23:07,823 --> 00:23:12,767
So it doubles the number of hard concepts.

293
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:21,874
Sorry, my computer is slow.

294
00:23:25,077 --> 00:23:25,998
So the outside.

295
00:23:27,419 --> 00:23:28,900
Let's go to the production team.

296
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,422
So in-house.

297
00:23:32,506 --> 00:23:36,527
We are organizing small core team for each type of asset.

298
00:23:38,488 --> 00:23:41,449
Each core team is in charge of producing, managing

299
00:23:42,289 --> 00:23:46,550
all of the sensitive art and technical-driven assets,

300
00:23:47,471 --> 00:23:51,332
and polish all the data coming from the art hosting partner.

301
00:23:51,892 --> 00:23:55,253
So we can see that it's not a huge team, in fact.

302
00:23:56,273 --> 00:24:01,115
Well, we have really a small team.

303
00:24:01,852 --> 00:24:04,032
but with very skilled artists.

304
00:24:08,914 --> 00:24:12,256
And we also do many months outsourcing.

305
00:24:15,277 --> 00:24:19,138
So the set creation process, it's placeholder,

306
00:24:19,379 --> 00:24:23,900
real-time testing, production in the Maya viewer, icing.

307
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:27,462
I mean polish, doing the lighting setup,

308
00:24:28,942 --> 00:24:30,143
putting the visual effects.

309
00:24:30,697 --> 00:24:31,917
and doing the post-processing.

310
00:24:38,919 --> 00:24:44,740
So you will see a little video.

311
00:24:45,861 --> 00:24:48,461
It's a placeholder.

312
00:24:50,502 --> 00:24:55,183
And you've got the data coming from the outsourcing.

313
00:24:55,983 --> 00:24:58,563
And after that, the polishing.

314
00:25:06,738 --> 00:25:08,779
I think you can see the difference.

315
00:25:16,661 --> 00:25:21,543
In this video, you saw the real-time testing.

316
00:25:21,683 --> 00:25:25,324
So just do a pause.

317
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:30,026
We've got some dimension constraint,

318
00:25:30,346 --> 00:25:35,027
because every set is recreated during the mock-up session.

319
00:25:36,246 --> 00:25:41,767
So in this video, all the red objects

320
00:25:43,927 --> 00:25:50,748
mean animation, maybe gameplay and interaction.

321
00:25:52,129 --> 00:25:56,129
And for the blue surfaces, it means hand contact.

322
00:25:57,910 --> 00:26:00,350
So when we send it to production,

323
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:05,491
it means that 3D production, but also.

324
00:26:06,267 --> 00:26:08,048
animation and mocap production.

325
00:26:08,949 --> 00:26:12,271
So when we've got a 3D placeholder like that,

326
00:26:13,552 --> 00:26:18,135
we just have to recreate it on the mocap facility

327
00:26:18,996 --> 00:26:19,697
and do the shooting.

328
00:26:21,178 --> 00:26:26,522
And in parallel, we can also produce the polish set.

329
00:26:34,047 --> 00:26:35,588
And this is a final result.

330
00:26:40,170 --> 00:26:40,610
testing.

331
00:26:41,570 --> 00:26:44,672
So we can also validate collision.

332
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:46,933
We can improve motion kit.

333
00:26:48,113 --> 00:26:50,194
We can test camera shot.

334
00:26:51,074 --> 00:26:51,815
So everything.

335
00:26:52,155 --> 00:26:55,396
It's a kind of a skeleton for the production.

336
00:26:56,777 --> 00:27:00,539
It's the same for the cinematic.

337
00:27:01,319 --> 00:27:04,160
It's a kind of 3D storyboard.

338
00:27:04,740 --> 00:27:08,502
So we can solve some technical issues.

339
00:27:10,105 --> 00:27:12,825
visual issues, many issues, in fact.

340
00:27:24,789 --> 00:27:27,250
Let's talk about the design of the characters.

341
00:27:28,130 --> 00:27:31,551
So on the character side, design is slightly different

342
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:34,772
because every rain is based on emotion, story,

343
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:36,752
and characterization.

344
00:27:37,852 --> 00:27:38,953
So characters are.

345
00:27:39,538 --> 00:27:40,598
one of the main focus.

346
00:27:41,699 --> 00:27:46,662
We need to find actors able to play, to give emotion,

347
00:27:46,802 --> 00:27:50,304
to perform a scene like in the movie.

348
00:27:51,424 --> 00:27:53,285
So everything starts with a casting

349
00:27:53,626 --> 00:27:57,047
to identify the right actor.

350
00:27:57,848 --> 00:28:01,770
And we do the same for the main characters,

351
00:28:02,150 --> 00:28:05,532
but also for the secondary one or for sidekicks.

352
00:28:07,510 --> 00:28:10,371
After that, fashion designer and art concept

353
00:28:11,071 --> 00:28:15,253
provide mood boards and a final vision of the character.

354
00:28:18,494 --> 00:28:20,874
Everything is packaged for production.

355
00:28:26,236 --> 00:28:30,978
So here is some picture taken from the casting.

356
00:28:32,038 --> 00:28:35,519
So the casting is done from board.

357
00:28:36,853 --> 00:28:41,998
by agent, but also we've got video casting with dialogue

358
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:43,219
and scene to play.

359
00:28:46,782 --> 00:28:50,185
This is Mr. Shelby before it was Ethan.

360
00:28:54,029 --> 00:28:56,291
And this guy is not really an actor.

361
00:28:57,912 --> 00:28:58,653
It's a guy.

362
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:03,002
who come in a free open casting.

363
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:07,584
And we say, oh, it's got a good look for one

364
00:29:07,684 --> 00:29:08,764
of the secondary character.

365
00:29:09,264 --> 00:29:11,325
So get on board.

366
00:29:14,987 --> 00:29:20,489
This is a classic fashion design board with many details, rings,

367
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:27,592
all this small detail matching to the characterization.

368
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,881
And after that, final heart.

369
00:29:32,481 --> 00:29:36,062
We also do, not in this case, but we also

370
00:29:36,082 --> 00:29:38,223
do what we call the turnaround, just

371
00:29:38,263 --> 00:29:43,524
to help the artist to do the body modeling.

372
00:29:47,245 --> 00:29:50,386
So on character, the process is quite classical.

373
00:29:50,446 --> 00:29:55,727
We do a photo session, 3D scan session.

374
00:29:56,507 --> 00:29:58,348
We do the resurfacing in ZBrush.

375
00:29:59,422 --> 00:30:02,284
and we produce and finalize the skin shaders

376
00:30:02,505 --> 00:30:07,648
and specific visual effects directly in the Maya plugin.

377
00:30:09,230 --> 00:30:13,092
The animation setup is also, I mean, rigging and skinning

378
00:30:13,473 --> 00:30:15,955
is also done in Maya.

379
00:30:17,236 --> 00:30:21,058
We do animation for body and for facial.

380
00:30:28,306 --> 00:30:30,047
So this is a classic photo shooting.

381
00:30:31,648 --> 00:30:32,188
Same guys.

382
00:30:40,732 --> 00:30:42,013
This is a 3D scan.

383
00:30:43,234 --> 00:30:46,575
So you can notice that it's not a magic tool.

384
00:30:47,936 --> 00:30:51,078
It's quite precise, but we lose many details

385
00:30:51,318 --> 00:30:56,921
in some specific area, like here's convex surfaces or airs.

386
00:30:59,464 --> 00:31:02,526
So it's not a 360 degree scan.

387
00:31:02,967 --> 00:31:06,009
So we are not able to perform a full body scan.

388
00:31:15,137 --> 00:31:19,161
Concerning the resurfacing, we developed a tool

389
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:24,426
that enables us to project a face template

390
00:31:25,086 --> 00:31:25,927
to match the 3D scan.

391
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:30,697
So it's quite useful and very quick,

392
00:31:31,237 --> 00:31:37,162
because it ensures that each face has the right topology

393
00:31:37,563 --> 00:31:39,925
for muscles and facial animation.

394
00:31:41,887 --> 00:31:45,390
And all the micro details of the flesh,

395
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,852
I mean wrinkles, imperfection of the skin,

396
00:31:48,332 --> 00:31:49,773
are added in ZBrush.

397
00:31:56,475 --> 00:32:03,238
You can notice, too, that this guy is going much more badass.

398
00:32:03,978 --> 00:32:09,481
So because we think that his face was too flat,

399
00:32:10,121 --> 00:32:14,283
so we tried to make him much more aggressive.

400
00:32:15,263 --> 00:32:20,386
So sometimes we have the freedom to change a little bit

401
00:32:21,706 --> 00:32:24,608
to improve the characterization.

402
00:32:28,132 --> 00:32:30,434
The body is totally built in ZBrush.

403
00:32:30,735 --> 00:32:33,357
It's finalized in Maya and in the QD viewer.

404
00:32:34,338 --> 00:32:37,901
And the polygon budget is close to $20,000,

405
00:32:38,942 --> 00:32:44,408
approximately $10,000 for the head and $10,000 for the body,

406
00:32:44,948 --> 00:32:47,851
depending on the fashion design.

407
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:04,232
We also do facial animation.

408
00:33:04,672 --> 00:33:11,338
So we can test facial expression directly in the QD viewer.

409
00:33:16,623 --> 00:33:19,085
So it's not blend shapes.

410
00:33:19,726 --> 00:33:21,908
It's a bone-based system.

411
00:33:31,076 --> 00:33:34,398
So let's talk about the tools.

412
00:33:37,660 --> 00:33:41,562
After Fahrenheit, we've done a huge post-mortem,

413
00:33:41,702 --> 00:33:46,244
and we asked the R&D to build a real-time viewer directly

414
00:33:46,324 --> 00:33:47,305
integrated in Maya.

415
00:33:47,965 --> 00:33:51,847
Because we really think that real-time visualization

416
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:57,190
is crucial in terms of production, but for artists.

417
00:34:00,290 --> 00:34:07,172
We use Maya 8.5 integrated in OpenGL engine viewer,

418
00:34:07,752 --> 00:34:09,873
directly linked to a PS3 remote.

419
00:34:10,493 --> 00:34:14,454
So we can send automatically the data directly

420
00:34:14,494 --> 00:34:16,295
through to the PS3 dev kit.

421
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,918
So the QD EPR Shed, it's a nodal material editor.

422
00:34:26,648 --> 00:34:29,150
We've got our own shaders.

423
00:34:29,411 --> 00:34:32,513
We've got real time on shading network and lighting.

424
00:34:34,715 --> 00:34:38,378
The advantages, it's improved the artistic control.

425
00:34:38,998 --> 00:34:41,881
We can build simple and complex shaders.

426
00:34:42,961 --> 00:34:45,684
It's an artist-driven shader.

427
00:34:45,844 --> 00:34:46,985
No need of a code.

428
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:51,929
It's easy to recruit, because when you're coming from a CG

429
00:34:52,329 --> 00:34:55,651
and you know Maya quite well, it's the same.

430
00:34:57,347 --> 00:34:58,968
But there is some disadvantages.

431
00:34:59,828 --> 00:35:03,430
It means that you can build many, many, many shading

432
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:05,611
networks, and very complex.

433
00:35:07,832 --> 00:35:11,954
So artists need to become much more technical.

434
00:35:16,216 --> 00:35:18,477
The Maya Realtime Viewer and the PS3 Remote.

435
00:35:19,770 --> 00:35:22,770
So we've got, as I say, real-time feedback

436
00:35:22,830 --> 00:35:27,231
on shaders, lighting, animation, visual effects, and particles.

437
00:35:30,492 --> 00:35:33,593
The main goals are always improving

438
00:35:33,893 --> 00:35:38,654
the artistic control, polish, decrease time consuming export.

439
00:35:39,014 --> 00:35:44,535
I mean, when you have to export, check in the engine.

440
00:35:46,741 --> 00:35:50,342
So you saw some bugs where you need to do some visual retext.

441
00:35:50,882 --> 00:35:54,623
You came back to your package, do the retext, re-export.

442
00:35:54,803 --> 00:35:55,563
So it's boring.

443
00:35:56,743 --> 00:36:01,584
And it spends too much time specifically on Fahrenheit.

444
00:36:01,644 --> 00:36:02,725
So we say, no.

445
00:36:04,085 --> 00:36:06,886
We need to have a much more smooth pipeline.

446
00:36:09,206 --> 00:36:11,367
We also can do much more iteration.

447
00:36:15,475 --> 00:36:16,756
The post-processing editor.

448
00:36:18,057 --> 00:36:21,258
So it allows us to manage post-processing

449
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:23,700
as a 2D composite layer.

450
00:36:25,161 --> 00:36:30,223
As you can see, the GUI is very close to the Photoshop style

451
00:36:30,303 --> 00:36:30,643
layer.

452
00:36:32,144 --> 00:36:39,908
So it's really easy to handle for juniors and for seniors.

453
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:44,768
We can do many iteration without changing any data.

454
00:36:44,988 --> 00:36:49,791
So we can add a layer for saturation, for contrast,

455
00:36:50,411 --> 00:36:53,853
for light, for luminance.

456
00:36:54,593 --> 00:36:56,915
We can add depth of field, and we've

457
00:36:56,955 --> 00:36:58,195
got the real-time feedback.

458
00:36:58,916 --> 00:37:03,658
So everything is compiled in a kind of preset.

459
00:37:04,459 --> 00:37:09,761
You save it, and you can send it to the camera department

460
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:11,202
or to the script.

461
00:37:12,502 --> 00:37:15,563
And they can change dynamically the rendering.

462
00:37:17,884 --> 00:37:20,604
So for prototyping, it's quite useful.

463
00:37:21,165 --> 00:37:23,905
And for the final tuning, too.

464
00:37:26,806 --> 00:37:30,747
We also had two tools.

465
00:37:31,567 --> 00:37:33,008
It's an ambient occlusion manager.

466
00:37:34,448 --> 00:37:38,609
I'm talking about everywhere, because now we don't use it.

467
00:37:39,170 --> 00:37:41,810
But on everywhere, we are making ambient occlusion.

468
00:37:43,117 --> 00:37:47,340
It was a huge Atlas sharing, quick baking, much more quick

469
00:37:47,380 --> 00:37:48,461
than a mental ray.

470
00:37:49,802 --> 00:37:53,044
And we can do some retakes in 2D package,

471
00:37:53,224 --> 00:37:56,666
send the Atlas to Photoshop, fix some bug,

472
00:37:56,686 --> 00:38:00,669
and get back to the engine.

473
00:38:04,171 --> 00:38:07,513
The other tool we are still using it,

474
00:38:08,674 --> 00:38:09,915
it's the ambience control.

475
00:38:10,015 --> 00:38:12,097
It's a curve-based editor.

476
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:16,170
We can animate all editable parameters from any type.

477
00:38:16,610 --> 00:38:20,633
So light intensity, meshes, specular power, skin shader,

478
00:38:21,754 --> 00:38:25,977
attribute, texture, texture map, mask, everything.

479
00:38:31,721 --> 00:38:36,204
So animating characters, I mean, the body part.

480
00:38:37,845 --> 00:38:39,246
So we've got 28 Vicon.

481
00:38:42,082 --> 00:38:48,163
I'm talking of an old time, because now we are 74.

482
00:38:49,564 --> 00:38:51,624
The marker set is 55.

483
00:38:52,704 --> 00:38:56,745
And we have many, many days of shooting.

484
00:38:58,205 --> 00:39:01,246
We also use some stuntmen, because there

485
00:39:01,286 --> 00:39:04,226
is some dangerous session.

486
00:39:05,027 --> 00:39:07,407
I mean fighting, falling.

487
00:39:07,907 --> 00:39:10,008
You will see a video.

488
00:39:10,708 --> 00:39:10,868
So.

489
00:39:11,653 --> 00:39:15,215
We also need to have some generic skeleton

490
00:39:16,415 --> 00:39:19,776
with some archetype matching to the stuntman.

491
00:39:24,477 --> 00:39:26,278
So the performance is split.

492
00:39:28,078 --> 00:39:34,460
So we can reuse many small part of a session.

493
00:39:38,961 --> 00:39:41,322
There is massive work on preparing the props.

494
00:39:42,551 --> 00:39:45,772
As I said previously, we can build for real

495
00:39:46,512 --> 00:39:50,013
on the mocap facility each set.

496
00:39:50,573 --> 00:39:53,474
So each set need to be rebuilt.

497
00:39:54,394 --> 00:40:00,036
And we've got a script always taking notes of any changes

498
00:40:00,196 --> 00:40:01,276
during the session.

499
00:40:06,498 --> 00:40:08,938
It requires a new approach of directing

500
00:40:09,638 --> 00:40:11,619
because actors have no references.

501
00:40:16,983 --> 00:40:22,865
And also, it's a huge investment from actors and long-term

502
00:40:23,605 --> 00:40:29,387
collaboration, because we shoot many, many, many days.

503
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:35,188
And we really need to have the actors in-house,

504
00:40:35,708 --> 00:40:40,510
because they are doing the body session, but also

505
00:40:40,810 --> 00:40:42,250
the facial session.

506
00:40:45,775 --> 00:40:50,758
So on facial, we shoot with camera.

507
00:40:51,538 --> 00:40:55,200
We've got a much more complex marker set

508
00:40:55,640 --> 00:40:57,361
because we need much more detail.

509
00:40:59,582 --> 00:41:08,047
Last day of shooting, but I'm not sure that it's the,

510
00:41:08,787 --> 00:41:10,448
I'm not sure that the actors agree.

511
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,322
We do the facial capture and the voice recording

512
00:41:15,422 --> 00:41:16,143
at the same time.

513
00:41:19,746 --> 00:41:21,548
Facial animation is split from body.

514
00:41:22,068 --> 00:41:26,673
So it means that we can use any facial animation

515
00:41:26,933 --> 00:41:28,474
on any body animation.

516
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,398
So it's quite useful, specifically

517
00:41:32,458 --> 00:41:38,223
when you're talking about a game with many branching, many story

518
00:41:38,263 --> 00:41:38,683
branching.

519
00:41:40,123 --> 00:41:41,324
So it's very useful.

520
00:41:41,464 --> 00:41:44,726
You don't have to redo all the animation

521
00:41:45,226 --> 00:41:46,847
because they are standalone.

522
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:55,893
We also can do retargeting between characters

523
00:41:56,173 --> 00:42:01,176
because the facial rigging has the same template

524
00:42:01,216 --> 00:42:02,497
for every character.

525
00:42:02,557 --> 00:42:06,900
Think about it.

526
00:42:08,915 --> 00:42:12,217
When you do a facial mock-up, you

527
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:17,801
need to have the same acting as the body session.

528
00:42:18,382 --> 00:42:21,484
So it's quite a huge issue for the actors.

529
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,890
So let's have a look to a kind of making of.

530
00:43:47,615 --> 00:43:51,156
Come on!

531
00:43:51,516 --> 00:43:52,036
Ah!

532
00:43:52,456 --> 00:43:52,877
Ah!

533
00:45:03,631 --> 00:45:10,156
So I was supposed to show you some video of facial animation

534
00:45:12,198 --> 00:45:13,279
taken in real time.

535
00:45:14,360 --> 00:45:18,383
But we've got some issue between video and sound.

536
00:45:18,563 --> 00:45:21,465
So nothing is synchronized.

537
00:45:22,766 --> 00:45:23,186
It's not.

538
00:45:25,228 --> 00:45:26,149
It's an epic fail.

539
00:45:26,689 --> 00:45:29,491
So let's move on.

540
00:45:32,667 --> 00:45:38,049
On the fifth character part, I mean the rain.

541
00:45:44,753 --> 00:45:46,754
So when we scoot in Philadelphia,

542
00:45:48,135 --> 00:45:49,996
it was supposed to be a rainy season.

543
00:45:51,297 --> 00:45:57,200
We spend 10 days scooting, and it rains one single day.

544
00:45:59,601 --> 00:46:00,621
Another epic fail.

545
00:46:02,594 --> 00:46:05,296
We were a little bit disappointed.

546
00:46:07,017 --> 00:46:10,720
So we start to build a huge collection of documentation

547
00:46:11,380 --> 00:46:14,863
about rain, rain effect, just to identify

548
00:46:15,444 --> 00:46:19,327
the main aspect of this natural phenomena.

549
00:46:21,348 --> 00:46:24,611
So rain can be very different.

550
00:46:25,111 --> 00:46:30,455
Can be smoggy, very diffuse, heavy, hard, very aggressive.

551
00:46:31,625 --> 00:46:42,292
It's changed the color, the light, even the animation.

552
00:46:42,952 --> 00:46:46,674
Because you can see that when it's raining,

553
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:51,538
people always doing like that because it's very aggressive.

554
00:46:56,781 --> 00:46:59,583
So with this huge documentation.

555
00:47:01,990 --> 00:47:05,992
The concept artists start to paint over a real picture

556
00:47:06,412 --> 00:47:10,834
of a rainy day, just taken from the web.

557
00:47:11,534 --> 00:47:17,657
And they try to improve, to maximize some of their aspect.

558
00:47:18,497 --> 00:47:22,959
I mean, light diffusion, reflection, saturation,

559
00:47:24,179 --> 00:47:24,899
specularity.

560
00:47:26,140 --> 00:47:29,761
And it gives us a better understanding

561
00:47:30,202 --> 00:47:31,682
of what we need to recreate.

562
00:47:37,883 --> 00:47:41,085
So you can see that it has been paint over.

563
00:47:55,431 --> 00:47:59,693
But rain, it's also small details.

564
00:48:04,836 --> 00:48:05,196
Skies.

565
00:48:10,327 --> 00:48:12,848
light and diffusion of light.

566
00:48:19,672 --> 00:48:23,794
So I will show you in this video some example

567
00:48:23,954 --> 00:48:27,957
of wet environment in heavy rain.

568
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:36,182
So this is the crime scene.

569
00:48:40,884 --> 00:48:42,786
The butterfly power plant.

570
00:48:45,830 --> 00:48:46,490
Some highway.

571
00:48:46,510 --> 00:48:51,175
A junkyard.

572
00:48:53,558 --> 00:48:54,279
The doghouse.

573
00:48:57,743 --> 00:49:00,245
The highway taken from the taxidermist.

574
00:49:14,010 --> 00:49:20,913
So in this video, you can see the different layers

575
00:49:21,234 --> 00:49:27,957
we used to improve this rainy effect.

576
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:38,383
So a quick overview, because we need to have some lack of time.

577
00:49:39,130 --> 00:49:41,490
Rain effects are not just compound

578
00:49:41,510 --> 00:49:43,031
by layers of particles.

579
00:49:44,051 --> 00:49:48,032
Usually, people say, let's do particles, and it's raining.

580
00:49:48,312 --> 00:49:48,612
OK.

581
00:49:49,772 --> 00:49:52,333
It's 2D layer and 2D sprite.

582
00:49:53,053 --> 00:49:57,514
We also add some atmospheric effect with camera shaders

583
00:49:58,454 --> 00:50:00,235
and post-processing effect.

584
00:50:02,095 --> 00:50:07,077
We change materials specularity, and we do many adjustments.

585
00:50:07,801 --> 00:50:09,883
We also add some procedural ripples.

586
00:50:11,604 --> 00:50:14,667
We've got also the bouncing effect

587
00:50:14,707 --> 00:50:18,009
by adding secondary particle.

588
00:50:20,211 --> 00:50:25,475
And we also use wind effect created by VertexWind.

589
00:50:25,916 --> 00:50:30,440
But I'm not very proud of this part, because it sucks.

590
00:50:35,664 --> 00:50:36,364
Also rain.

591
00:50:36,905 --> 00:50:37,425
It's rain.

592
00:50:37,882 --> 00:50:53,989
on props, there, but also on this car.

593
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:05,134
So you can't afford to not having rain on a car.

594
00:51:07,005 --> 00:51:08,506
It's raining everywhere.

595
00:51:11,549 --> 00:51:14,431
But it's the same on the windows.

596
00:51:14,451 --> 00:51:17,494
It's very dark.

597
00:51:28,323 --> 00:51:32,026
So as I say, rain interacts with all props.

598
00:51:35,011 --> 00:51:40,213
We had some reflection effect on transparent materials,

599
00:51:40,673 --> 00:51:43,654
animated normal maps, ripples effect,

600
00:51:45,235 --> 00:51:49,357
animated UV texture map to create some flow effect.

601
00:51:50,417 --> 00:51:53,598
We animated a mask and video for the weeper.

602
00:51:55,399 --> 00:51:58,540
It's not a dynamic fluid simulation.

603
00:52:01,062 --> 00:52:06,603
And we synchronized video with Mesh's animation.

604
00:52:13,686 --> 00:52:17,867
We also had to create over-fluid effect, not just rain.

605
00:52:21,708 --> 00:52:25,169
For people who played heavy rain,

606
00:52:25,509 --> 00:52:28,570
there is a huge sequence when Madison had a shower.

607
00:52:32,530 --> 00:52:35,672
So this is not Madison, sorry.

608
00:52:38,113 --> 00:52:38,493
Next time.

609
00:52:45,857 --> 00:52:53,160
We also have a huge sequence when a car is floating.

610
00:53:07,374 --> 00:53:09,716
So we are supposed to do that in real time.

611
00:53:12,799 --> 00:53:13,879
It's a huge challenge.

612
00:53:16,882 --> 00:53:20,625
This sequence has been canceled because it

613
00:53:20,705 --> 00:53:26,570
was too paranormal for the story.

614
00:53:26,610 --> 00:53:29,052
So the icing hasn't been finished.

615
00:53:29,913 --> 00:53:36,078
But in fact, we were flooding the Ethan house.

616
00:53:36,740 --> 00:53:37,303
with water.

617
00:53:59,139 --> 00:54:04,063
So MISC effect done by dynamic particles, collider setup

618
00:54:04,223 --> 00:54:09,306
for the shower, secondary bounces also on the shower.

619
00:54:10,227 --> 00:54:16,592
We animated crack mask, meshes, swap for explosion,

620
00:54:17,192 --> 00:54:18,153
for window explosion.

621
00:54:18,693 --> 00:54:22,416
We've got 2D decal also for crack windows, sprite,

622
00:54:22,796 --> 00:54:23,877
reflection materials.

623
00:54:26,879 --> 00:54:27,660
Thank you.

624
00:54:30,011 --> 00:54:33,213
What is water without fire?

625
00:54:35,115 --> 00:54:36,476
So let's burn.

626
00:54:38,938 --> 00:54:46,083
We do fire meshes with a UV texture slide, smoke meshes,

627
00:54:47,224 --> 00:54:47,964
UV slide.

628
00:54:48,825 --> 00:54:51,347
We fake also some lighting variation,

629
00:54:53,108 --> 00:54:59,393
add some fire and sparkle particles, reflection meshes.

630
00:54:59,849 --> 00:55:04,414
for heat effect, additional smoke particles.

631
00:55:06,576 --> 00:55:13,443
And we need to do that for a 360 degree camera.

632
00:55:13,623 --> 00:55:17,547
And we need to avoid field rate issues.

633
00:55:22,131 --> 00:55:24,013
So here is the final result.

634
00:55:31,808 --> 00:55:33,176
It spoils a little bit but...

635
00:56:12,246 --> 00:56:14,047
So a conclusion.

636
00:56:14,067 --> 00:56:26,296
AVN requires a lot of high detail and high quality data.

637
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:33,302
Also, many tips and tricks, because we

638
00:56:33,342 --> 00:56:36,224
can't afford technically to do everything

639
00:56:37,585 --> 00:56:39,866
with real-time simulation.

640
00:56:41,673 --> 00:56:46,536
Rain is still, for me, difficult to simulate in real time.

641
00:56:48,196 --> 00:56:52,319
And the other challenge we have to solve

642
00:56:52,559 --> 00:56:56,021
was avoiding a hunkany valley effect.

643
00:56:57,362 --> 00:57:00,924
It's been a real daily fighting.

644
00:57:04,926 --> 00:57:07,527
Interactive drama is a kind of juggernaut.

645
00:57:09,911 --> 00:57:13,992
many data management, many things to produce, many paths,

646
00:57:14,592 --> 00:57:18,134
a huge testing step.

647
00:57:19,214 --> 00:57:24,736
And also, it requires a new way to work, especially

648
00:57:25,716 --> 00:57:26,916
regarding the complexity.

649
00:57:29,237 --> 00:57:36,439
And we hopefully add many tools to help us.

650
00:57:38,020 --> 00:57:39,300
The communication.

651
00:57:39,993 --> 00:57:43,715
for us is quite crucial, because we've

652
00:57:43,775 --> 00:57:50,640
got some artistic team in-house, but also overseas.

653
00:57:52,121 --> 00:57:56,664
Not on the same page, because there is some cultural gap.

654
00:57:58,846 --> 00:58:02,928
We need also to communicate cross-department challenges.

655
00:58:04,609 --> 00:58:07,511
And also, we need to communicate with publisher.

656
00:58:10,199 --> 00:58:13,181
Every rain is not a first person shooter.

657
00:58:13,481 --> 00:58:18,345
So you can't do a vertical slice of a story and say, oh,

658
00:58:18,725 --> 00:58:19,126
that's it.

659
00:58:20,446 --> 00:58:21,167
You can't do that.

660
00:58:22,448 --> 00:58:25,270
So in the early stage, we have one scene.

661
00:58:25,450 --> 00:58:29,053
We can test it, show it, show many graphics.

662
00:58:30,053 --> 00:58:37,619
But the project start to be really strong

663
00:58:38,259 --> 00:58:39,780
when everything is built.

664
00:58:41,030 --> 00:58:42,370
so close to the alpha.

665
00:58:44,011 --> 00:58:45,752
Because you have the big picture,

666
00:58:46,832 --> 00:58:51,174
you can handle the story, the complexity of a story.

667
00:58:53,075 --> 00:58:56,277
So it's quite hard to communicate to publisher,

668
00:58:57,737 --> 00:58:59,898
but also hard to communicate to the team,

669
00:59:00,519 --> 00:59:05,201
because they always saw some details, some scene, some set,

670
00:59:05,541 --> 00:59:06,321
some characters.

671
00:59:06,902 --> 00:59:10,543
But they can't handle the big picture.

672
00:59:11,152 --> 00:59:15,935
even if they had to read the script, 2,000 pages.

673
00:59:18,056 --> 00:59:21,738
So we had to communicate the art direction,

674
00:59:22,419 --> 00:59:27,702
to do micro synopsis, and always, always communicate

675
00:59:28,102 --> 00:59:29,223
internally with the team.

676
00:59:32,445 --> 00:59:36,107
We also had to make people more productive and creative.

677
00:59:36,848 --> 00:59:40,170
So build a solid pipeline, provide tools.

678
00:59:41,513 --> 00:59:49,897
and also increase the creation phase versus the data

679
00:59:49,917 --> 00:59:52,419
management time.

680
00:59:55,701 --> 01:00:02,584
So in conclusion, always try to be challenging, to be involved,

681
01:00:03,805 --> 01:00:06,707
and to bring new concept to life.

682
01:00:10,461 --> 01:00:11,482
Thank you for attending.

683
01:00:21,832 --> 01:00:22,893
Thank you for your passion.

684
01:00:24,474 --> 01:00:25,335
Sorry for your ears.

685
01:00:26,376 --> 01:00:31,101
And thanks to the Conti Dream team, because without them,

686
01:00:31,141 --> 01:00:33,683
we can't ship the game.
