1
00:00:05,965 --> 00:00:07,987
This was a difficult game to make,

2
00:00:08,447 --> 00:00:11,789
but we are happy to share the stuff that we think is cool.

3
00:00:12,869 --> 00:00:13,990
We're pretty proud of the audio.

4
00:00:14,030 --> 00:00:15,351
We worked on this for a long time,

5
00:00:16,251 --> 00:00:18,913
and we put a lot of thought and hard work into it.

6
00:00:19,593 --> 00:00:22,775
So this isn't going to focus on the hard parts

7
00:00:22,835 --> 00:00:23,956
and the challenges of development.

8
00:00:24,416 --> 00:00:26,157
We just want to share a handful of things

9
00:00:26,177 --> 00:00:27,418
that we think are cool that would

10
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,439
be useful to other people making open world games,

11
00:00:29,499 --> 00:00:31,921
or maybe wanted to take a risk on some

12
00:00:31,961 --> 00:00:32,701
of the things in their game.

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,601
The audio for this game was done by a coalition of developers,

14
00:00:40,241 --> 00:00:41,481
people from the publisher, which is me,

15
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:45,143
and freelance people working out of their houses or studios.

16
00:00:46,203 --> 00:00:47,183
My name's Christopher Melroth.

17
00:00:47,243 --> 00:00:48,484
I'm the head of audio for publishing,

18
00:00:48,864 --> 00:00:50,204
and I was the audio director for this game.

19
00:00:50,784 --> 00:00:53,805
I'm joined by Finishing Move, the Bryans, who

20
00:00:53,825 --> 00:00:54,706
did the music for the game.

21
00:00:55,346 --> 00:00:57,487
And we're going to walk you through a whole bunch

22
00:00:57,507 --> 00:00:59,327
of details, so thank you.

23
00:01:01,248 --> 00:01:01,688
Next up.

24
00:01:03,457 --> 00:01:06,720
I'm going to hand it over to the Bryans and they're going to do the first half of the talk all about the music.

25
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:10,903
So without further ado, the Bryans from Finishing Move.

26
00:01:16,487 --> 00:01:17,988
Hey there, I'm Brian Trefon.

27
00:01:18,268 --> 00:01:19,529
This is... I'm Brian White.

28
00:01:20,390 --> 00:01:23,612
And so we're going to talk about the music of Crackdown 3.

29
00:01:24,833 --> 00:01:29,937
So the topics we're going to cover is the composing strategies for a large open world,

30
00:01:30,477 --> 00:01:32,659
staying organized across tons of assets.

31
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:39,862
And then the benefits of composers implementing their own music, we implemented our score for it.

32
00:01:41,504 --> 00:01:45,769
So, essentially, the task at hand with Crackdown 3...

33
00:01:46,624 --> 00:01:48,785
It was scoring the island of New Providence.

34
00:01:48,885 --> 00:01:50,026
That's where it takes place.

35
00:01:51,447 --> 00:01:54,069
The New Providence is controlled by the evil

36
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,591
Terra Nova Corporation.

37
00:01:56,091 --> 00:01:58,833
They've got their hierarchy of corporate gangsters that are

38
00:01:58,873 --> 00:02:02,176
essentially the bosses that control various zones and

39
00:02:02,276 --> 00:02:03,497
assets throughout the island.

40
00:02:03,917 --> 00:02:05,479
And so we had to figure out, how do we

41
00:02:05,519 --> 00:02:07,060
approach music for this?

42
00:02:09,121 --> 00:02:11,103
So these are the challenges that we faced.

43
00:02:11,203 --> 00:02:12,864
The first is, it's an open world.

44
00:02:12,924 --> 00:02:13,805
You can kind of do.

45
00:02:14,478 --> 00:02:16,478
Literally things in any order that you want.

46
00:02:16,818 --> 00:02:18,859
You can enter in a boss battle and then run away.

47
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:22,639
So we had to figure out what is the music based around?

48
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,600
How do we make it support the gameplay?

49
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:28,681
What are we trying to tell with it?

50
00:02:28,701 --> 00:02:32,541
The next challenge is interactivity,

51
00:02:32,561 --> 00:02:36,022
and it's to figure out how much interactivity do we want?

52
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:36,842
Where do we want it?

53
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,403
How much can we get, given the limitations we have?

54
00:02:41,475 --> 00:02:44,877
And then third, we have to consider the musical style,

55
00:02:45,558 --> 00:02:47,159
which is super important.

56
00:02:47,279 --> 00:02:50,480
And so it's, what does this crackdown world of the island

57
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:51,761
of New Providence sound like?

58
00:02:53,162 --> 00:02:56,304
And with that consideration, do we need some licensed music

59
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,285
to support that, or are we going to do all original score?

60
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,911
So I'm going to dig deeper into the musical style

61
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:04,452
that we did for it.

62
00:03:04,512 --> 00:03:08,013
So I think the main thing that we're trying to achieve with

63
00:03:08,093 --> 00:03:13,296
the music was to just get that feeling of like, you're Terry

64
00:03:13,336 --> 00:03:17,598
Cruz, you're jumping around on the top of buildings, you're

65
00:03:17,618 --> 00:03:18,458
blasting people.

66
00:03:18,979 --> 00:03:22,680
Like the visceral, the fun aspect of that, the futuristic

67
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,361
sort of nature of the world.

68
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:31,492
So stylistically, we came up with what we called cinematic

69
00:03:31,672 --> 00:03:32,392
cyber trap.

70
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:36,614
That was sort of the combination of influences.

71
00:03:37,394 --> 00:03:40,956
And so what that ends up meaning is it's basically we

72
00:03:41,036 --> 00:03:41,876
took a lot from

73
00:03:42,453 --> 00:03:46,495
Like modern hip hop, trap rap music, so like big 808s,

74
00:03:47,235 --> 00:03:49,956
lots of like attitude and swagger and vibe.

75
00:03:51,236 --> 00:03:55,518
Some of the cinematic and larger than life nature

76
00:03:55,538 --> 00:03:57,378
that you get from film trailer music.

77
00:03:58,339 --> 00:04:00,979
And then like we were inspired by a lot of the,

78
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,681
like just highly stylized musical sound design,

79
00:04:04,701 --> 00:04:06,381
electronic music and bass music.

80
00:04:06,441 --> 00:04:10,342
Like people like Noisia, Amon Tobin, Two Fingers,

81
00:04:10,623 --> 00:04:11,263
that sort of stuff.

82
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:17,574
So with that music and that style, the way we approached

83
00:04:17,655 --> 00:04:21,159
it, and Brian White's going to talk a lot more about this, we

84
00:04:21,379 --> 00:04:23,743
themed a lot of it around the bosses and.

85
00:04:25,202 --> 00:04:27,723
and their different zones and things like that.

86
00:04:27,763 --> 00:04:29,123
And we'll get into the details of that.

87
00:04:29,664 --> 00:04:33,846
But we really wanted to capture the unique and distinct personalities

88
00:04:33,886 --> 00:04:37,007
and quirks of these different bosses.

89
00:04:38,468 --> 00:04:42,410
And so the way we approached that with this cinematic Cyber Trap style

90
00:04:42,430 --> 00:04:46,352
was essentially for each boss, we would write a linear piece of music,

91
00:04:46,412 --> 00:04:50,674
like a three or four minute piece, that has all of their themes

92
00:04:50,834 --> 00:04:51,094
and just...

93
00:04:52,164 --> 00:04:53,665
totally captures their vibe.

94
00:04:54,445 --> 00:04:59,546
And then we digest those into the interactive assets later.

95
00:04:59,646 --> 00:05:02,787
So it's like creating a sketch that just totally covers the

96
00:05:02,827 --> 00:05:06,448
vibe, has the feeling, the melodies associated with those

97
00:05:07,068 --> 00:05:09,749
characters that we can use throughout.

98
00:05:09,949 --> 00:05:14,010
And then break that up into the interactive assets and

99
00:05:14,050 --> 00:05:15,771
create more stuff based on those sketches.

100
00:05:17,096 --> 00:05:21,838
With the music, we decided to do an all original score, so there's no licensed music.

101
00:05:22,259 --> 00:05:23,219
It's a lot of music.

102
00:05:23,339 --> 00:05:26,641
I think it's close to four hours that's in there.

103
00:05:27,221 --> 00:05:35,385
And a big part of why we did that was we wanted to achieve coherency throughout the musical world in the game.

104
00:05:35,445 --> 00:05:41,007
So we wanted the music to sound like what you might hear like on the radio or in the club in the future.

105
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,383
So to be futuristic, but also to have the cinematic and

106
00:05:44,423 --> 00:05:47,045
narrative elements that you can only get with the score of

107
00:05:47,085 --> 00:05:52,710
like light motifs and character motifs and being able to have

108
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:57,695
the music react or foreshadow things like you get in a film

109
00:05:57,815 --> 00:05:59,396
or a very cinematic sort of game.

110
00:06:00,898 --> 00:06:04,381
And we also wanted to avoid some of the risks that can be

111
00:06:04,421 --> 00:06:04,901
involved.

112
00:06:05,422 --> 00:06:06,422
with licensing music.

113
00:06:06,442 --> 00:06:09,603
Like one of the issues that's happened in the past is,

114
00:06:10,143 --> 00:06:12,944
if a game came out 10 years ago, and they didn't secure

115
00:06:12,964 --> 00:06:16,204
the rights in perpetuity for a song, because they never

116
00:06:16,244 --> 00:06:19,105
thought it would be released on Xbox One or come out on

117
00:06:19,185 --> 00:06:21,486
Game Pass or something, they'd have to go back.

118
00:06:21,546 --> 00:06:22,786
And that can be a lot of headache.

119
00:06:22,806 --> 00:06:23,746
It could be expensive.

120
00:06:23,986 --> 00:06:26,267
Or sometimes it can be just actually impossible.

121
00:06:26,807 --> 00:06:30,228
So we wanted to mitigate that with just all commissioned

122
00:06:30,268 --> 00:06:30,968
original score.

123
00:06:32,058 --> 00:06:32,518
That's what we did.

124
00:06:32,719 --> 00:06:38,987
So we're going to show you a little montage example of this cinematic cyber trap sound.

125
00:06:40,068 --> 00:06:42,812
This is with no sound effects or dialogue.

126
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:47,157
It's just cut to the boss battle so you can get the flavor of the visual style and the

127
00:06:47,177 --> 00:06:49,060
musical style and how that goes together.

128
00:10:14,024 --> 00:10:21,771
So how did we get all those sick beats to work in an open world game where, like Brian was saying,

129
00:10:21,831 --> 00:10:26,394
you can basically do anything you want in any order. So you can basically start the game and

130
00:10:26,434 --> 00:10:31,619
go after the final boss and you could be in that fight and you could run away. So you load once

131
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:38,124
into this huge open world map and that's it. You can kind of go where you want, do what you want.

132
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:44,503
or sort of not follow any prescribed thing at all and just throw cars around at people.

133
00:10:45,385 --> 00:10:54,428
So how do we sort of take and use music to support the narrative of the game,

134
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:59,410
support the story sort of of direct players towards things?

135
00:11:00,031 --> 00:11:03,832
And what Brian had mentioned is we sort of decided that we'd theme things

136
00:11:04,052 --> 00:11:07,294
around these bosses, these corporate gang bosses.

137
00:11:07,434 --> 00:11:09,574
And so I say it's all about that boss base.

138
00:11:10,195 --> 00:11:14,777
And so each boss controls certain assets in the world, in the island of Terra Nova.

139
00:11:15,496 --> 00:11:18,441
or New Providence, and the idea is.

140
00:11:19,523 --> 00:11:23,565
These assets can represent certain missions that the player can take on.

141
00:11:23,625 --> 00:11:31,227
And if you complete enough of these missions, let's say you destroy enough turrets or mine

142
00:11:31,287 --> 00:11:37,869
machinery, you can actually draw that boss out into a final boss fight to defeat that

143
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:41,851
boss and sort of work your way through the different bosses in the game.

144
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:44,012
And like I said, you can do that in any order.

145
00:11:44,072 --> 00:11:45,812
You can actually take on the captains.

146
00:11:46,373 --> 00:11:48,998
before the lieutenants, and it's pretty crazy.

147
00:11:49,199 --> 00:11:55,412
You'll probably lose, but you totally have agency towards that.

148
00:11:57,627 --> 00:12:01,451
And the reason we wanted to do that, so music is not persistent, because a lot of people

149
00:12:01,491 --> 00:12:07,196
play Crackdown where they don't actually want to go after the missions all the time.

150
00:12:07,236 --> 00:12:13,122
They just want to go run crazy in the world, collect orbs, level up, kind of just do their

151
00:12:13,182 --> 00:12:14,983
thing, kind of do stunts in the world.

152
00:12:15,043 --> 00:12:16,705
So you're not hearing music all the time.

153
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:21,790
And so we wanted to make music special in that it either informs you that,

154
00:12:21,950 --> 00:12:25,033
hey, this is something important, this is a mission,

155
00:12:25,093 --> 00:12:28,616
you can take this on and sort of move through the narrative of the game.

156
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:34,742
We also wanted to use music to reward the player or essentially say who won or who lost.

157
00:12:34,782 --> 00:12:37,664
Did you die or did you complete the mission?

158
00:12:38,345 --> 00:12:39,466
Did you level up?

159
00:12:39,746 --> 00:12:41,648
And you hear sort of a little musical.

160
00:12:42,169 --> 00:12:46,211
reward. And so we have sort of this boss-themed music as well as

161
00:12:46,711 --> 00:12:51,153
agency-themed music for when you level up and accomplish things.

162
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:59,897
So I've got a little example here of how a mission, how you would encounter a mission from sort of no audio,

163
00:12:59,958 --> 00:13:01,718
no music in the world to

164
00:13:02,119 --> 00:13:06,481
encountering a mission and then hearing how that progresses and completes.

165
00:13:08,273 --> 00:13:11,635
Enforcer operation you bust up loosens their grip on the island.

166
00:13:12,235 --> 00:13:16,876
Dismantle enough low-level troops, you'll force their top-dog lieutenant to come out

167
00:13:16,957 --> 00:13:17,477
and play.

168
00:13:18,077 --> 00:13:19,818
And that's when you drop her.

169
00:13:20,698 --> 00:13:23,559
Then the whole Enforcer Brigade goes bye-bye.

170
00:14:13,122 --> 00:14:15,725
Things are getting dusty in Nova's Chemical HQ.

171
00:14:16,205 --> 00:14:22,492
For a man who calls himself a genius.

172
00:14:31,232 --> 00:14:32,533
that you're in a mission area,

173
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:34,676
then combat music kicks in,

174
00:14:35,057 --> 00:14:38,301
and then you get a sort of reward themed to that boss,

175
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:41,184
and you hear some of their themes kick in

176
00:14:41,485 --> 00:14:42,967
when you complete that mission.

177
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:44,489
And the breakdown of this,

178
00:14:44,509 --> 00:14:45,950
like I said, there's nine bosses.

179
00:14:46,691 --> 00:14:48,192
that you can encounter in the game.

180
00:14:48,212 --> 00:14:51,634
And there's quite a few assets for each boss.

181
00:14:51,674 --> 00:14:55,436
So we started, like Brian said, with sort of a sketch that was two to four minutes

182
00:14:55,456 --> 00:14:59,158
that sort of defined their swagger, their flavor, their themes.

183
00:14:59,579 --> 00:15:01,320
That helped us get buy-in from...

184
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:07,221
Chris, you know, make him happy, stoked on what that sounds like, and then we'd go and make almost

185
00:15:07,261 --> 00:15:16,084
like 20-25 minutes of music sort of abstracted from that as a palette for those bosses. So the

186
00:15:16,244 --> 00:15:22,726
ambient loops, there's combat loops, there's three sets of combat loops, there's low health, death,

187
00:15:22,946 --> 00:15:25,347
down but not out, loops and stingers.

188
00:15:25,757 --> 00:15:28,679
There's also a whole bunch of just notification one-shots.

189
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:30,140
So it's not looping music.

190
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,481
It'll be things like when you enter a boss's area

191
00:15:32,541 --> 00:15:35,083
for the first time, you'll get kind of like a little thematic

192
00:15:35,103 --> 00:15:36,164
10-second stinger.

193
00:15:36,964 --> 00:15:41,187
When you see one of their assets show up in the world,

194
00:15:41,247 --> 00:15:43,949
you'll get a little eyes-on stinger that's sort of themed

195
00:15:44,249 --> 00:15:45,490
towards that boss.

196
00:15:45,510 --> 00:15:47,931
So there's all these little sort of leitmotif moments

197
00:15:48,632 --> 00:15:49,452
where you're hearing the.

198
00:15:50,933 --> 00:15:56,637
bosses theme kind of trickle in, and those all sort of culminate in this final boss battle.

199
00:15:56,697 --> 00:16:00,800
So when you draw the boss out, you complete enough missions to draw the boss out.

200
00:16:01,701 --> 00:16:02,842
That's when you get these sort of

201
00:16:03,382 --> 00:16:11,608
scripted boss battle moments where it's it's it's loops sort of train card, and we're sandwiching those between actual

202
00:16:12,028 --> 00:16:15,231
scored to linear runtime sequences.

203
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:17,346
And I have a little example of that.

204
00:16:17,847 --> 00:16:23,832
And I'll annotate on the screen when it's actually scored to picture to the runtime

205
00:16:23,872 --> 00:16:28,676
sequence versus it's in the interactive music system and running the state system.

206
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:39,586
Oh, this place is seriously messed up.

207
00:16:40,445 --> 00:16:46,766
Well, well, it has come to this. I can take the pressure. Question is, can you?

208
00:16:50,247 --> 00:16:53,747
Gate is trying to redirect the pressure to release valves across the plant.

209
00:16:54,247 --> 00:16:56,828
We need to hit those valves and purge the whole system.

210
00:16:58,688 --> 00:17:02,749
Pressure we sent down the line should have opened up the valves, but they're locked tight.

211
00:17:03,069 --> 00:17:08,910
All units, defend those control panels with your lives. Do not let the agent deactivate them.

212
00:17:10,904 --> 00:17:19,010
That's it, agent. Hack that panel to free up the piston and blow that valve.

213
00:17:24,214 --> 00:17:30,498
You need to hack the control terminal and expose the next valve, agent.

214
00:17:32,369 --> 00:17:33,490
That's one down.

215
00:17:33,930 --> 00:17:35,871
Re-routing pressure to auxiliary outlet.

216
00:17:36,312 --> 00:17:38,133
Protect those valves, you fool!

217
00:17:38,653 --> 00:17:40,175
Looks like another valve is vulnerable.

218
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:42,476
Pack the panels. Take it out.

219
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,181
I'll make this simple.

220
00:17:48,601 --> 00:17:51,003
Kill the agents, or everybody dies.

221
00:18:07,124 --> 00:18:10,325
You have no idea what you are doing!

222
00:18:10,525 --> 00:18:14,166
We know exactly what we're doing. We're flashing you, you piece of shit!

223
00:18:16,307 --> 00:18:18,127
Let off some steam, game duck.

224
00:18:22,769 --> 00:18:25,730
The Kaida and the chemical plant blown to smithereens?

225
00:18:26,230 --> 00:18:29,111
Terra Nova's industrial division is on the ropes.

226
00:18:29,411 --> 00:18:32,451
The pipelines sending Chimera to Vargas have been cut off at the source.

227
00:18:33,052 --> 00:18:34,752
It'll be a lot easier to reach her, Agent.

228
00:18:37,953 --> 00:18:42,816
So the boss battle is really that sort of, when you get the full enchilada, you get the

229
00:18:42,936 --> 00:18:45,518
full beat and it's this really cool visual thing.

230
00:18:45,558 --> 00:18:49,200
You actually hear it all kick in and you've been hearing these themes kind of throughout

231
00:18:49,420 --> 00:18:54,523
and that's kind of your reward as you're fighting this boss, this like super lit trap music.

232
00:18:55,711 --> 00:18:58,934
There's some additional interactive systems I'll just go through really quickly.

233
00:18:58,974 --> 00:19:02,739
There's some things called reinforcements based on a hate meter.

234
00:19:02,779 --> 00:19:07,565
So if you're just causing trouble in the world, the captains can come after you.

235
00:19:07,625 --> 00:19:10,588
And there's a musical system that sort of says like, oh, okay.

236
00:19:11,231 --> 00:19:12,352
These guys are coming at you.

237
00:19:13,833 --> 00:19:15,934
The kingpin, who is the lead boss,

238
00:19:16,034 --> 00:19:17,975
she can actually lock down the whole city.

239
00:19:18,055 --> 00:19:21,838
So that's like sort of like a big retaliation reinforcement

240
00:19:21,878 --> 00:19:22,378
from her.

241
00:19:23,238 --> 00:19:27,001
And those, you either win them or you die to get rid of those.

242
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:30,343
And then we've got some side missions in the game, propaganda

243
00:19:30,383 --> 00:19:33,044
towers, and these different races.

244
00:19:33,144 --> 00:19:35,846
And those each have their own little interactive systems

245
00:19:36,066 --> 00:19:36,967
to support those.

246
00:19:40,897 --> 00:19:43,518
Briefly talk about some of the diegetic world music.

247
00:19:44,399 --> 00:19:47,621
So we created a whole bunch of stuff for, there's lots of

248
00:19:47,721 --> 00:19:51,604
businesses in the games and night clubs and things like

249
00:19:51,624 --> 00:19:56,368
that, and so we wanted a way to just, one, just fill out

250
00:19:56,488 --> 00:19:59,850
the world, and also to add a little bit of humor and just

251
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:01,691
more color to the environment.

252
00:20:03,354 --> 00:20:05,516
There's a bunch of these businesses that have holographic

253
00:20:05,596 --> 00:20:08,678
advertisements, and so we made non-looping jingles for them.

254
00:20:09,539 --> 00:20:12,281
And then for nightclubs, and there's boom boxes that you

255
00:20:12,301 --> 00:20:15,544
can pick up throughout the world, we made cool, looping

256
00:20:15,604 --> 00:20:16,184
pieces of music.

257
00:20:16,204 --> 00:20:23,110
We did over 50 unique little jingles and pieces for the

258
00:20:23,150 --> 00:20:23,931
diegetic music.

259
00:20:24,011 --> 00:20:26,353
And by the way, in case of diegetic, that means it's

260
00:20:26,413 --> 00:20:27,974
coming out of something in the world.

261
00:20:28,074 --> 00:20:31,917
So it's coming out of a speaker or a holographic

262
00:20:32,057 --> 00:20:32,718
advertisement.

263
00:20:33,323 --> 00:20:36,665
So it's funny because our background is actually started

264
00:20:36,725 --> 00:20:37,426
in commercials.

265
00:20:37,746 --> 00:20:39,948
So we were able to flex our muscle doing that.

266
00:20:39,968 --> 00:20:40,788
So I'll show you an example.

267
00:20:40,828 --> 00:20:45,171
This is for the Cash Cow loans business.

268
00:20:46,632 --> 00:20:49,174
And in the actual game, it would be futzed.

269
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,956
But for just the sake of this example, this is just going to

270
00:20:51,996 --> 00:20:53,217
be just clear.

271
00:20:54,558 --> 00:20:55,899
So that is.

272
00:21:09,190 --> 00:21:17,116
So just, you know, low rent television commercial just to add like some more humor and color to the world.

273
00:21:17,917 --> 00:21:22,681
So next, Brian White's going to talk about how we stayed organized across all of the tons of assets.

274
00:21:25,043 --> 00:21:32,309
Yeah, so this game was like almost five years in development and we did four hours of music.

275
00:21:32,409 --> 00:21:35,652
So just like lots of assets and then lots of time.

276
00:21:36,511 --> 00:21:39,453
putting that together, design changes, and that kind of stuff.

277
00:21:39,473 --> 00:21:42,634
So we really had to kind of stay organized.

278
00:21:43,214 --> 00:21:46,576
And we used some typical things like spreadsheets.

279
00:21:46,676 --> 00:21:49,097
But really, the most interesting thing I want to

280
00:21:49,137 --> 00:21:52,319
show you guys is something that Chris actually developed.

281
00:21:52,619 --> 00:21:53,980
And it's these Visio.

282
00:21:54,901 --> 00:22:00,202
flowcharts that really sort of take all the interactivity

283
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:03,283
and they put it into this really nice visual

284
00:22:03,643 --> 00:22:07,684
so that everybody from us who are doing the implementation

285
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:10,965
and writing the music to the coders,

286
00:22:11,065 --> 00:22:13,406
to even the designers, the level designers,

287
00:22:13,706 --> 00:22:17,447
they can sort of understand and either comment

288
00:22:17,667 --> 00:22:22,008
or know how the music system is supposed to work.

289
00:22:22,068 --> 00:22:22,768
And this actually,

290
00:22:23,649 --> 00:22:26,811
These things got sent in emails numerous times.

291
00:22:27,492 --> 00:22:28,993
This is how this is supposed to work.

292
00:22:29,073 --> 00:22:31,556
But actually, they're super effective.

293
00:22:32,276 --> 00:22:36,040
It would have been very difficult to just dive in and

294
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,983
create a music system from scratch in Wwise without

295
00:22:40,464 --> 00:22:41,104
looking at these.

296
00:22:43,288 --> 00:22:45,049
Yeah, oh, I just wanted to make sure that was on.

297
00:22:45,509 --> 00:22:47,610
Wwise doesn't have a good way to visualize

298
00:22:47,690 --> 00:22:50,051
your interactive system, it's a bunch of menus and lists.

299
00:22:50,711 --> 00:22:54,393
And so, for our brains to be wrapped around

300
00:22:54,453 --> 00:22:55,913
how this was all gonna come together,

301
00:22:57,094 --> 00:22:58,875
Visio is a great tool, there's other tools like that

302
00:22:58,915 --> 00:23:00,676
that I get, Visio for freaks, I work at Microsoft.

303
00:23:01,096 --> 00:23:05,438
So, I use that one, and I wish that

304
00:23:06,118 --> 00:23:08,339
the interactive music systems would actually use

305
00:23:08,479 --> 00:23:09,920
a visual scripting system like this

306
00:23:09,940 --> 00:23:11,681
so that we could see how the music's going through

307
00:23:11,721 --> 00:23:12,381
as opposed to these.

308
00:23:13,187 --> 00:23:16,170
sort of dumb lists that are impossible to debug

309
00:23:16,490 --> 00:23:17,070
once they're built.

310
00:23:17,691 --> 00:23:18,852
But we debugged the music system

311
00:23:18,872 --> 00:23:19,993
before we built it this way,

312
00:23:20,373 --> 00:23:22,235
because I had to be completely honest

313
00:23:23,195 --> 00:23:24,917
about how many cues I was requesting.

314
00:23:24,957 --> 00:23:27,118
So this is the entire interactive music system

315
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,380
in the fully zoomed out view.

316
00:23:30,441 --> 00:23:32,663
And then, so what we did is we mirrored this

317
00:23:32,723 --> 00:23:37,267
with an actual linear spreadsheet.

318
00:23:37,347 --> 00:23:38,307
Oh, sorry, can you go back?

319
00:23:39,856 --> 00:23:43,159
Anywhere it says campaign gameplay, no score is playing.

320
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,921
So instead of having like one big block

321
00:23:45,941 --> 00:23:47,002
where everything comes off of that,

322
00:23:47,683 --> 00:23:49,524
it's you're just basically understanding

323
00:23:49,544 --> 00:23:52,647
campaign gameplay is just a simulation of the world.

324
00:23:53,447 --> 00:23:55,209
And then you can get in and out of any state

325
00:23:55,289 --> 00:23:56,370
by following the flow graph.

326
00:23:57,511 --> 00:24:00,173
And this really helped with the transition matrix

327
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:02,175
because there's like, you can literally go

328
00:24:02,515 --> 00:24:03,436
anywhere to anywhere.

329
00:24:03,536 --> 00:24:08,240
So our transition list in Wwise is, it's a bit insane.

330
00:24:10,725 --> 00:24:14,027
It takes a long time to load the interactive music system.

331
00:24:14,828 --> 00:24:17,210
This is just a linear list so that we could sort of

332
00:24:18,071 --> 00:24:23,495
have a list of everything and then make notes on that and sort of we check that in and out of Perforce

333
00:24:24,116 --> 00:24:29,680
so that we could make either design notes or the coders could say how they wired it up

334
00:24:30,721 --> 00:24:35,385
or we could just keep track of how many minutes we were writing for the different cues and transitions.

335
00:24:36,904 --> 00:24:39,665
And then this is just a quick example of just some wise

336
00:24:39,725 --> 00:24:40,365
organization.

337
00:24:40,485 --> 00:24:46,027
We're very, very organized with such a big game.

338
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,788
And we had very specific naming conventions on

339
00:24:48,908 --> 00:24:52,690
everything that sort of lasted throughout the development.

340
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:56,651
There's even typos that Chris made that we just kept those

341
00:24:56,711 --> 00:25:02,013
naming conventions so that everything stayed true all the

342
00:25:02,053 --> 00:25:02,694
way to ship.

343
00:25:04,544 --> 00:25:10,210
And I really like to use a lot of folders and all the labeling capabilities that Wwise has.

344
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:14,534
It's really useful in the interactive music system, especially for transitions,

345
00:25:14,574 --> 00:25:19,378
like transitions to and from folders, instead of just like having to make one for every individual

346
00:25:19,479 --> 00:25:25,684
asset. And naming your transitions, because we had, we probably had at least a few hundred,

347
00:25:25,745 --> 00:25:29,668
maybe like 500 plus transitions in there that needed to be accounted for.

348
00:25:31,737 --> 00:25:37,039
And then finally, I'll just talk really briefly about composers as implementers.

349
00:25:37,419 --> 00:25:44,502
So we built the whole music system in Wwise, so it wasn't a system that already existed that we just threw assets into.

350
00:25:44,522 --> 00:25:49,644
I actually took those design documents and I built the entire system myself.

351
00:25:50,616 --> 00:25:55,240
I knew exactly how it was supposed to work and how everything wired up, how the states worked,

352
00:25:55,280 --> 00:26:00,865
how the stingers worked, how the transitions worked. And really the benefit of this is just

353
00:26:00,905 --> 00:26:06,330
being able to provide instant feedback that instructs the composition process. So we could

354
00:26:06,370 --> 00:26:11,274
iterate ourselves just by testing either in SoundCaster or testing in a build to know like

355
00:26:11,314 --> 00:26:14,176
yep that's not going to work or that transition needs to be twice as long.

356
00:26:14,770 --> 00:26:17,792
It needs to be half as long, you know, just those basics.

357
00:26:18,192 --> 00:26:21,574
And I think that's, you hear that a lot, like, oh yeah, you know,

358
00:26:21,594 --> 00:26:25,436
composers should implement because then they can make better music.

359
00:26:25,536 --> 00:26:29,559
And I think the biggest one that we ended up

360
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,480
figuring out late in the development cycle

361
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,281
was just being able to own the polish

362
00:26:35,341 --> 00:26:38,182
and find and fix bugs a lot faster.

363
00:26:38,302 --> 00:26:42,003
So in the last two months of the game before ship,

364
00:26:42,063 --> 00:26:44,624
I was playing every day, probably three, four hours a day,

365
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:47,785
just playing the build and then back and wise.

366
00:26:48,385 --> 00:26:52,187
And I was catching bugs that testing was not catching,

367
00:26:52,407 --> 00:26:55,007
nobody else on the sound team was catching,

368
00:26:55,047 --> 00:26:57,328
just because I knew exactly how

369
00:26:57,588 --> 00:26:59,489
all the specific little systems worked.

370
00:27:00,166 --> 00:27:02,648
And then I was able to go in and fix those bugs,

371
00:27:03,268 --> 00:27:06,971
or in the event where there might not be code support,

372
00:27:07,071 --> 00:27:10,433
just come up with creative solutions for making it work.

373
00:27:10,493 --> 00:27:12,835
You know, like, oh, I can tweak this, I can make this,

374
00:27:12,895 --> 00:27:15,376
and we can make it work with what we have.

375
00:27:16,097 --> 00:27:20,039
And I think that is pretty difficult

376
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:22,561
if you're also relying on a sound designer

377
00:27:22,981 --> 00:27:24,562
who's implementing the music,

378
00:27:24,582 --> 00:27:25,803
and they've got a million things.

379
00:27:26,404 --> 00:27:30,226
It was amazing for me as the audio director, because at the end I'm just chasing a million bugs,

380
00:27:30,286 --> 00:27:32,328
and especially perf on this game was a real problem.

381
00:27:33,148 --> 00:27:37,791
And Brian White, like, just, hey, I fixed this today.

382
00:27:38,312 --> 00:27:40,173
Okay. Sounds awesome, buddy.

383
00:27:40,193 --> 00:27:43,575
It was far too big a game to play through on a daily basis.

384
00:27:44,774 --> 00:27:47,617
Yeah, so and then just a couple of the challenges with that.

385
00:27:47,677 --> 00:27:53,443
We were working on this coast and there was also teams in the UK.

386
00:27:53,523 --> 00:27:57,187
So there's just your typical, you know, sync time differences.

387
00:27:57,308 --> 00:28:02,173
Like I'd lose Perforce access in the middle of the day and they'd all be sleeping.

388
00:28:02,193 --> 00:28:02,233
So.

389
00:28:02,827 --> 00:28:06,170
Just those kind of things and keeping up with those changes.

390
00:28:06,270 --> 00:28:09,613
But in the end, it was actually super valuable.

391
00:28:09,974 --> 00:28:15,339
And it wasn't that hard to embed in the development process

392
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:18,682
and really add a lot of value to the team.

393
00:28:21,372 --> 00:28:22,313
You want to do this last one?

394
00:28:22,913 --> 00:28:24,254
So we're going to hand it over to Chris.

395
00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:28,097
Just the key takeaways, just in terms of composing

396
00:28:28,137 --> 00:28:31,179
for an open world, you have to have a unique approach

397
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:33,720
and think about what is the music based around.

398
00:28:35,021 --> 00:28:38,383
With, obviously, the organization, as Brian showed,

399
00:28:38,403 --> 00:28:40,505
it's like having different ways of communicating

400
00:28:40,545 --> 00:28:43,327
that information beyond just a single spreadsheet really

401
00:28:43,367 --> 00:28:46,389
helps keep everybody across teams on the same page.

402
00:28:47,947 --> 00:28:50,208
You know, the composer's implementing their music,

403
00:28:50,468 --> 00:28:52,709
then you can react to things very fast

404
00:28:52,789 --> 00:28:54,249
and just get it going.

405
00:28:54,409 --> 00:28:56,070
So now we're going to hand things over to Chris

406
00:28:56,130 --> 00:28:57,910
for his portion of the talk.

407
00:28:59,511 --> 00:29:00,171
All right, time check.

408
00:29:00,351 --> 00:29:01,612
I think you guys are right on schedule.

409
00:29:01,952 --> 00:29:02,912
Yeah, you got 30 minutes.

410
00:29:02,992 --> 00:29:03,312
Hang on.

411
00:29:03,432 --> 00:29:03,752
All right.

412
00:29:04,473 --> 00:29:06,013
I got 80 slides to do in 30 minutes.

413
00:29:06,293 --> 00:29:07,674
I'm going to not micro-machines it,

414
00:29:08,134 --> 00:29:09,854
but I'm going to gloss over some of the details that

415
00:29:09,874 --> 00:29:10,134
are up here.

416
00:29:10,154 --> 00:29:11,575
And you can always get the slide deck later

417
00:29:11,595 --> 00:29:13,115
and dig into the numbers if you would

418
00:29:13,255 --> 00:29:14,496
like to see more details.

419
00:29:14,756 --> 00:29:15,016
All right.

420
00:29:17,704 --> 00:29:23,909
I'm going to focus on some sound design systems and some mix stuff that we did.

421
00:29:24,169 --> 00:29:29,033
When we get to the destruction section, James Nixon and Dan Krizliff right here in the front

422
00:29:29,073 --> 00:29:33,376
row actually made all these slides and they did all the hard work on this and all I had

423
00:29:33,396 --> 00:29:38,360
to do was copy and paste them in here and make it sound dumber for myself to present.

424
00:29:38,921 --> 00:29:42,343
So thank you guys and they did an amazing job on this game.

425
00:29:45,629 --> 00:29:47,010
We wanted kind of cool acoustics,

426
00:29:47,090 --> 00:29:49,432
and we needed to do it super cheap and super fast.

427
00:29:49,512 --> 00:29:50,573
So I'm going to share how we did that,

428
00:29:50,853 --> 00:29:51,794
because I think it sounds all right.

429
00:29:54,516 --> 00:29:56,117
If you don't know what Crackdown is, there's two modes.

430
00:29:56,137 --> 00:29:57,418
There's campaign and multiplayer.

431
00:29:57,438 --> 00:30:02,162
The multiplayer hosts 10 players in a fully destructible world.

432
00:30:02,322 --> 00:30:04,683
You can take down entire buildings piece by piece,

433
00:30:04,964 --> 00:30:06,385
like literally piece by piece.

434
00:30:06,465 --> 00:30:09,827
So in order to play the physics sounds for all that,

435
00:30:09,927 --> 00:30:11,569
it was an incredible technical challenge.

436
00:30:11,609 --> 00:30:12,770
So I'm going to share how we do that.

437
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:18,689
We have an individual system that is also part of destruction, but turbulence.

438
00:30:18,909 --> 00:30:21,990
So it's something that I personally have always wanted to get into a game,

439
00:30:22,010 --> 00:30:24,812
because I hate it when a physics object is flying through the air and it's just silent.

440
00:30:25,132 --> 00:30:26,573
I want that movie whoosh as it goes by.

441
00:30:26,593 --> 00:30:28,013
So I'm going to share how we did that.

442
00:30:28,914 --> 00:30:33,736
Just a real quick short thing on LFE, because as being in the publisher side,

443
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:38,098
we work on a bunch of different games, and I see a lot of inconsistency about how people treat LFE,

444
00:30:38,138 --> 00:30:39,379
and I'm a huge fan of LFE.

445
00:30:39,999 --> 00:30:43,321
I'm going to share at least how we thought about LFE on this game.

446
00:30:44,389 --> 00:30:47,873
And then I'll show you some, I'm going to try to get to the mix stuff as fast as possible

447
00:30:47,913 --> 00:30:49,234
because there's a lot of detail there.

448
00:30:49,935 --> 00:30:51,917
And mix is on everyone's mind.

449
00:30:53,118 --> 00:30:53,339
All right.

450
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,123
So the acoustic system.

451
00:31:00,074 --> 00:31:06,095
I did some sessions with a blind gamer named Sightless Combat, and he is incredible.

452
00:31:06,115 --> 00:31:07,176
He's an incredible resource.

453
00:31:07,956 --> 00:31:12,857
And like, this game shouldn't be playable by someone blind, but I took it as a challenge

454
00:31:13,077 --> 00:31:17,598
of anything that would be good for Ben to be able to play this game would be great for

455
00:31:17,638 --> 00:31:17,938
everyone.

456
00:31:17,958 --> 00:31:23,239
I mean, if he doesn't get a piece of audio information to understand where he is, where

457
00:31:23,259 --> 00:31:24,360
the bad guy is, what's happening.

458
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,802
then it's actually a failure on the audio director's part to

459
00:31:27,842 --> 00:31:29,243
not identify that for all users.

460
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:32,766
So he was generous, and he gave me some of his time when he

461
00:31:32,786 --> 00:31:33,366
was in Redmond.

462
00:31:34,868 --> 00:31:36,689
And he played the game with headphones on.

463
00:31:36,889 --> 00:31:38,250
And I would just ask him questions.

464
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:41,633
And one of the first things that came up was his ability

465
00:31:41,673 --> 00:31:43,334
to navigate the environment was pretty rough.

466
00:31:44,595 --> 00:31:48,098
Because really, he just had to listen for either ambience or

467
00:31:48,158 --> 00:31:50,060
bad guys or traffic or something to try to get his

468
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:50,620
orientation.

469
00:31:52,002 --> 00:31:53,582
A big chunk of the game is platforming.

470
00:31:53,662 --> 00:31:57,664
So the ability to know where a building is or some sort of

471
00:31:57,984 --> 00:32:00,865
traversable object was important.

472
00:32:01,385 --> 00:32:03,166
And the best way to do that is echolocation.

473
00:32:03,386 --> 00:32:05,427
So echolocation is really hard.

474
00:32:05,467 --> 00:32:06,987
It's a complex physical interaction.

475
00:32:07,087 --> 00:32:08,848
You've got a wave that propagates out into

476
00:32:08,888 --> 00:32:10,569
environment, bounces around, scatters, and

477
00:32:10,609 --> 00:32:11,249
comes back to you.

478
00:32:11,289 --> 00:32:14,710
And your perception of that delay, and the loudness, and

479
00:32:14,730 --> 00:32:17,892
the texture of that sound that comes back is acoustics.

480
00:32:19,239 --> 00:32:24,961
The whole game takes place in an urban environment, so we didn't have to worry about forests or caves or really anything like that.

481
00:32:25,021 --> 00:32:27,383
It's pretty much all city street and rooftops.

482
00:32:28,403 --> 00:32:30,784
It needed to be fully dynamic because I didn't want to build two systems.

483
00:32:30,844 --> 00:32:33,666
I just wanted to build one system and have it work for both single-player and multiplayer.

484
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:36,567
And in multiplayer, you can blast through walls and take down buildings.

485
00:32:36,587 --> 00:32:38,588
So the building that used to be there is no longer there.

486
00:32:38,628 --> 00:32:45,832
So we couldn't pre-process the environment and make some sort of detail map of the acoustic layout.

487
00:32:46,212 --> 00:32:47,853
We had to do something that was fully dynamic.

488
00:32:48,830 --> 00:32:51,810
We didn't have any time to make a custom plugin for early reflections.

489
00:32:53,131 --> 00:33:00,032
And we started on this right before Wise Reflect came out. So we basically built Wise Reflect, but inside of Wise without Wise Reflect.

490
00:33:03,173 --> 00:33:07,714
It's an awesome plugin and that actually does more than what we were able to do, but for how cheap

491
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:12,495
CPU-wise our system was, I think that it sounds pretty good.

492
00:33:13,317 --> 00:33:15,398
We didn't have any time to do manual markup.

493
00:33:15,418 --> 00:33:16,058
The city's too big.

494
00:33:16,999 --> 00:33:21,902
So we couldn't go in and draw zones or make low-res structures

495
00:33:22,102 --> 00:33:24,043
that mirrored the game's geometry.

496
00:33:25,164 --> 00:33:27,285
And then also, acoustics are just noise.

497
00:33:28,186 --> 00:33:29,226
Reverb is noise.

498
00:33:29,887 --> 00:33:31,908
And so the more of that you want to feature,

499
00:33:31,948 --> 00:33:33,089
the more noise you're adding to your game.

500
00:33:33,109 --> 00:33:38,092
And there was a whole insane design ethos

501
00:33:38,112 --> 00:33:39,132
that I pushed on everyone.

502
00:33:39,373 --> 00:33:41,394
No noise, no distortion.

503
00:33:42,324 --> 00:33:47,225
This has got to be tight, clean, punchy, and I want to hear tone, and I want to hear power,

504
00:33:47,605 --> 00:33:51,026
but without using distortion and noise, which is, as we all know, it's impossible.

505
00:33:51,346 --> 00:33:56,427
But the choice to push that as hard as we could meant that the game sounds nice and

506
00:33:56,467 --> 00:33:59,527
clean and I didn't want to muddy that up.

507
00:34:00,048 --> 00:34:02,648
So when you decide to use distortion or noise, it's intentional.

508
00:34:02,788 --> 00:34:06,189
You're not just using it on everything and then trying to figure out how to get the noise

509
00:34:06,209 --> 00:34:08,189
and distortion out of your game once it's all baked in.

510
00:34:08,809 --> 00:34:10,910
So if we're going to add acoustics into the game.

511
00:34:11,967 --> 00:34:13,949
We didn't want to undo all that hard work that we had done.

512
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,211
Cool.

513
00:34:17,411 --> 00:34:19,212
All right, so the technology that we

514
00:34:19,253 --> 00:34:25,477
employ to get the data back and make a sense of the acoustics

515
00:34:25,697 --> 00:34:26,318
are pretty simple.

516
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:29,400
We ray cast in five directions.

517
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:31,101
We do five rays per frame.

518
00:34:31,161 --> 00:34:31,481
That's it.

519
00:34:32,442 --> 00:34:34,424
We do them on the corners, and we do one overhead.

520
00:34:36,144 --> 00:34:39,085
And it's all listener relative, so it comes out from the listener,

521
00:34:39,126 --> 00:34:40,106
which in our game is the camera,

522
00:34:40,126 --> 00:34:41,527
because I think camera is the best listener.

523
00:34:41,667 --> 00:34:44,149
I don't like to fudge with it and like move it in between

524
00:34:44,409 --> 00:34:46,490
or put it on a spline or put it on a character.

525
00:34:46,530 --> 00:34:48,912
I just like camera because what I see is what I hear.

526
00:34:52,794 --> 00:34:55,856
We then take the data output by the rays

527
00:34:55,896 --> 00:34:56,737
and we do two things with it.

528
00:34:56,777 --> 00:34:58,938
We turn that data into RTBC parameters

529
00:34:59,979 --> 00:35:01,980
that we use to manipulate all the different sends

530
00:35:02,621 --> 00:35:03,821
and do some other trick stuff with.

531
00:35:04,718 --> 00:35:08,000
But that data also under the hood determines how we

532
00:35:08,060 --> 00:35:09,300
interpolate between the delays.

533
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,881
So we go out to 50 meters, because that's kind of what

534
00:35:12,102 --> 00:35:13,262
you couldn't really afford more.

535
00:35:13,362 --> 00:35:16,463
Every game-defined send and wise that you add is extra

536
00:35:16,503 --> 00:35:17,304
overhead per voice.

537
00:35:17,844 --> 00:35:20,145
And given the scale of this game and how many bad guys we

538
00:35:20,185 --> 00:35:22,746
can throw at you and stuff, we're often running 900, 1,500

539
00:35:22,806 --> 00:35:25,107
sends with this system.

540
00:35:25,527 --> 00:35:27,688
So if you even just add one more, you're multiplying out,

541
00:35:27,768 --> 00:35:28,809
and it gets crazy.

542
00:35:28,889 --> 00:35:32,230
So I would have loved to have gone out to 250 meters so that

543
00:35:32,250 --> 00:35:34,091
we could have done procedural echoes and everything.

544
00:35:34,131 --> 00:35:34,231
But.

545
00:35:35,686 --> 00:35:37,047
50 meters was like a good compromise.

546
00:35:39,468 --> 00:35:42,170
Then we take both the actor mixers

547
00:35:42,330 --> 00:35:43,871
and the output of the game defined sends

548
00:35:43,891 --> 00:35:45,392
and we route those through some reverbs.

549
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:49,255
One of which is close and one of which is distant.

550
00:35:49,675 --> 00:35:51,376
Both of those are using impulse responses

551
00:35:51,637 --> 00:35:52,837
that were recorded in city streets.

552
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:56,280
And I'll show you how we do that stuff.

553
00:35:56,360 --> 00:35:58,962
So I'm gonna skip that.

554
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:01,844
I think you can barely see it

555
00:36:01,904 --> 00:36:03,985
cause it's a single pixel that's moving around.

556
00:36:05,829 --> 00:36:11,433
A single ray cast is far too rigid, so what we do is we jitter them, and we take the output

557
00:36:11,493 --> 00:36:13,755
of the jitter and we average that over time.

558
00:36:14,055 --> 00:36:17,978
Then I take the output of that and I also smooth that in Wwise just because it was still

559
00:36:17,998 --> 00:36:18,778
a little too twitchy.

560
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:28,045
And we stop ray casting at 50 meters, beyond that point where we don't have any delays

561
00:36:28,085 --> 00:36:31,007
to go to, so it's a slight optimization.

562
00:36:33,079 --> 00:36:36,622
All right, so the RTPCs that we create are each direction.

563
00:36:36,682 --> 00:36:39,224
We measure the distance between the ray from the listener

564
00:36:39,304 --> 00:36:40,485
to the object that it's striking.

565
00:36:41,986 --> 00:36:45,128
We use that for attenuating the delays.

566
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:47,690
So we're interpolating to different delay lines

567
00:36:48,231 --> 00:36:50,092
so that farther away there's a longer delay

568
00:36:50,132 --> 00:36:51,173
before the slap comes back,

569
00:36:51,353 --> 00:36:53,315
and different longer time between the slaps.

570
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:57,398
And then we use that distance to attenuate it

571
00:36:57,438 --> 00:36:58,298
as though it's getting quieter

572
00:36:58,318 --> 00:36:59,479
because there's no object out there.

573
00:36:59,499 --> 00:37:00,540
It's not actually in 3D.

574
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,302
It's just sending to one that's hard panned.

575
00:37:02,991 --> 00:37:05,232
a bus that's hard panned here, here, in each direction,

576
00:37:05,332 --> 00:37:07,213
matching the orientation of the rays.

577
00:37:08,994 --> 00:37:12,115
We also get, in order to further reduce noise,

578
00:37:12,535 --> 00:37:14,656
reverb sounds pretty bad if you have all these reflections

579
00:37:14,696 --> 00:37:15,857
and all this reverb, and then you're folding

580
00:37:15,877 --> 00:37:16,557
it down to stereo.

581
00:37:17,878 --> 00:37:20,459
So we detect the endpoint

582
00:37:20,599 --> 00:37:21,619
that the person's listening on,

583
00:37:22,420 --> 00:37:25,241
and if they don't have those speakers,

584
00:37:25,281 --> 00:37:27,422
we just mute those and the reverb.

585
00:37:27,702 --> 00:37:28,763
So I mute the bus.

586
00:37:28,803 --> 00:37:29,783
Like, if there's no rears.

587
00:37:30,788 --> 00:37:31,849
Rear reflections, gone.

588
00:37:32,129 --> 00:37:33,030
Rear reverb, gone.

589
00:37:33,530 --> 00:37:34,430
Overhead, same thing.

590
00:37:35,811 --> 00:37:37,852
And that way, so you're not folding down reflections of

591
00:37:37,892 --> 00:37:39,933
things that you don't have speakers for, back and

592
00:37:39,973 --> 00:37:40,493
doubling them up.

593
00:37:41,153 --> 00:37:43,134
You might even hear in a few of these captures, I forgot to

594
00:37:43,194 --> 00:37:46,296
toggle back to stereo because the video capture actually

595
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:47,777
folds down internally.

596
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:49,457
And it does a terrible job at it.

597
00:37:49,497 --> 00:37:53,039
So if you hear any weirdness with some flangey stuff, it's

598
00:37:53,079 --> 00:37:55,700
actually the delay is getting folded down, I can speak.

599
00:37:58,365 --> 00:38:01,148
All right, and then we just take the rudimentary values

600
00:38:01,168 --> 00:38:02,449
that we're getting back from all those rays,

601
00:38:02,929 --> 00:38:05,351
and we create a super low-res version

602
00:38:05,492 --> 00:38:06,833
of the volume of the space that you're in.

603
00:38:07,613 --> 00:38:09,655
And that's not meant for any detail

604
00:38:09,735 --> 00:38:12,097
other than big space or small space.

605
00:38:12,618 --> 00:38:16,741
And between those ranges, up to a million cubic meters,

606
00:38:17,782 --> 00:38:19,283
we can determine how much we want to send

607
00:38:19,323 --> 00:38:21,065
to the close reverb and how much we want to send

608
00:38:21,085 --> 00:38:21,505
to the far reverb.

609
00:38:24,182 --> 00:38:26,804
The reverbs are just stock-wise convolutional reverbs.

610
00:38:27,584 --> 00:38:29,486
And then these are some of the parameters that we use

611
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:32,408
to control them and shape them.

612
00:38:32,468 --> 00:38:34,590
So if you're in a smaller space, it's got less spread

613
00:38:35,270 --> 00:38:37,172
and it's a little bit hyped in the loudness.

614
00:38:37,212 --> 00:38:39,053
And as you go into a larger space,

615
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:43,637
it opens up and it gets into the wider space

616
00:38:44,037 --> 00:38:46,139
that comes up in volume and the close one comes down.

617
00:38:47,019 --> 00:38:49,501
Super simple, like nothing special about it,

618
00:38:49,962 --> 00:38:51,703
just trying to solve problems and be clever

619
00:38:51,803 --> 00:38:52,343
with what we had.

620
00:38:53,108 --> 00:38:55,789
All right, so I've got a series of videos to show this off.

621
00:38:56,209 --> 00:38:57,009
Hopefully it reads in here.

622
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,170
It's a big echoey room.

623
00:38:58,290 --> 00:39:02,132
But this is the dry signal of the carbine in a test level.

624
00:39:02,152 --> 00:39:12,156
All right, next one is early reflection soloed.

625
00:39:22,417 --> 00:39:24,017
So if you hear something, that means that there's

626
00:39:24,037 --> 00:39:25,298
a reflection coming off that geometry.

627
00:39:28,900 --> 00:39:29,420
Super simple.

628
00:39:30,141 --> 00:39:31,361
It is filtered just a little bit,

629
00:39:31,381 --> 00:39:32,582
because we don't want to send so much low end

630
00:39:32,602 --> 00:39:33,582
and we don't want to send so much high end,

631
00:39:33,602 --> 00:39:34,343
so it's bandpassed.

632
00:39:34,803 --> 00:39:36,904
And it gets more bandpassy the farther away it is from you.

633
00:39:39,165 --> 00:39:40,466
This is only the distant reverb.

634
00:39:45,929 --> 00:39:47,609
So as you can see, as I get away from that geometry,

635
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:48,690
the space volume increases.

636
00:39:49,591 --> 00:39:50,771
And that was hard to hear.

637
00:39:53,795 --> 00:39:55,996
All right, and then this is just the acoustics,

638
00:39:56,036 --> 00:39:56,776
not the dry signal.

639
00:40:07,861 --> 00:40:08,941
So up to this point now,

640
00:40:09,081 --> 00:40:10,282
we've got everything playing together,

641
00:40:10,482 --> 00:40:12,283
and hey, it sounds kind of city-like.

642
00:40:14,283 --> 00:40:16,544
We didn't want to overhype the acoustics.

643
00:40:16,624 --> 00:40:18,665
You know, we're not doing like battlefield-style gun tails.

644
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:20,486
This game is all sound design forward,

645
00:40:20,526 --> 00:40:22,787
so the sound design of the gun itself is key.

646
00:40:23,955 --> 00:40:28,238
But we still wanted to glue everything together and give you that sense of being in an urban environment.

647
00:40:28,679 --> 00:40:44,551
So this is with everything including the dry signal.

648
00:40:44,911 --> 00:40:46,372
That's it. That's our acoustics.

649
00:40:47,393 --> 00:40:52,356
The side benefit of spending some time on early reflections in that urban environment is that it sounds pretty good on voices.

650
00:40:59,182 --> 00:41:00,822
It also helps you judge distance.

651
00:41:15,149 --> 00:41:16,889
Just like a lot of people like that, the battlefield talk,

652
00:41:16,909 --> 00:41:19,270
they did everything like most of their system was player-centric.

653
00:41:19,290 --> 00:41:20,771
Same with ours. Our AI is really stupid.

654
00:41:20,811 --> 00:41:21,752
It doesn't really know much.

655
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:25,769
So what we would do is we would pass a token when you do something to the AI system and

656
00:41:25,789 --> 00:41:31,054
say like, hey, player has fired a gun, so someone should scream and that kind of stuff.

657
00:41:32,235 --> 00:41:34,757
It's better than actually having the AI try to know what's going on.

658
00:41:35,177 --> 00:41:35,798
That's expensive.

659
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:42,705
There's also propaganda, so this horrible corporation that is totally not Microsoft,

660
00:41:43,885 --> 00:41:50,269
this horrible corporation is in control of the whole island, and they blast you with

661
00:41:50,309 --> 00:41:55,632
propaganda, these huge holographic Blade Runner-style propagandas, and it sounds pretty good on

662
00:41:55,652 --> 00:41:55,972
that too.

663
00:41:56,212 --> 00:41:58,473
A vision of brighter tomorrows.

664
00:41:59,114 --> 00:42:01,535
A vision powered by human potential.

665
00:42:02,476 --> 00:42:06,558
Together, we will forge a bold new future.

666
00:42:07,235 --> 00:42:10,136
Together, we are Terra Nova.

667
00:42:12,676 --> 00:42:12,917
All right.

668
00:42:14,317 --> 00:42:16,738
So that's our acoustics in total.

669
00:42:16,938 --> 00:42:18,038
All right, cloud destruction.

670
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:21,059
This is the hardest stuff that we had to tackle.

671
00:42:21,439 --> 00:42:23,180
I mean, it really took, honest to God,

672
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,561
it took a technological miracle for audio folks

673
00:42:25,601 --> 00:42:26,681
to figure out how to do this.

674
00:42:30,582 --> 00:42:32,943
All of the physics for the multiplayer sessions

675
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,023
are calculated on a server.

676
00:42:35,411 --> 00:42:37,852
There is no data for any of that destruction.

677
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:39,613
None of the physics interactions, anything,

678
00:42:39,853 --> 00:42:40,874
exist on your game client.

679
00:42:42,075 --> 00:42:46,157
So we rely on all those values to determine,

680
00:42:46,177 --> 00:42:48,418
hey, a piece of concrete was flying this fast

681
00:42:48,558 --> 00:42:49,519
and hit this other thing,

682
00:42:49,739 --> 00:42:51,920
and I need to play a sound for all of that.

683
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:53,160
And they're like, cool,

684
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,661
well, I can give you the position of it,

685
00:42:55,582 --> 00:42:56,162
which doesn't help.

686
00:42:59,297 --> 00:43:02,359
Technologically, it's quite difficult and sophisticated.

687
00:43:02,459 --> 00:43:04,280
I'll just do the simple version, because that's how I

688
00:43:04,320 --> 00:43:04,840
understand it.

689
00:43:05,821 --> 00:43:07,982
There's a cloud server that all the players connect to.

690
00:43:08,342 --> 00:43:11,384
It's hosting an instance of the game where all of the

691
00:43:11,424 --> 00:43:12,305
physics are being done.

692
00:43:12,865 --> 00:43:15,587
All of that data is then sent down to your local server.

693
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:18,008
Your local server speaks to your local client.

694
00:43:18,128 --> 00:43:19,349
Those are both on the same machine.

695
00:43:20,329 --> 00:43:22,511
And that then is rendered.

696
00:43:24,632 --> 00:43:26,993
So here's basically what it looks like.

697
00:43:27,914 --> 00:43:28,775
with no audio on.

698
00:43:29,615 --> 00:43:32,337
This is the level of mayhem and chaos

699
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:35,418
that we have to try to make sound decent and sound cool.

700
00:43:35,678 --> 00:43:38,180
And hopefully, if we do our jobs, not fake,

701
00:43:38,360 --> 00:43:41,161
because it actually is all real physics.

702
00:43:43,242 --> 00:43:46,204
All right, so just real quick on some of the definitions

703
00:43:46,344 --> 00:43:47,485
of how all this stuff works.

704
00:43:49,586 --> 00:43:51,187
We've got the cloud server, we've got local server.

705
00:43:52,187 --> 00:43:54,669
Some of the things are CPU processed

706
00:43:54,709 --> 00:43:56,270
and some of the things are only on the GPU.

707
00:43:59,443 --> 00:44:01,924
Client-side prediction or CSP makes it so that things,

708
00:44:02,004 --> 00:44:03,384
you know, if you drop a packet or something,

709
00:44:03,424 --> 00:44:05,445
that something doesn't just stop and then update over here.

710
00:44:05,925 --> 00:44:07,025
It'll smoothly interpolate.

711
00:44:07,226 --> 00:44:09,706
And if it has to rewind and fix itself,

712
00:44:10,006 --> 00:44:13,227
it's less noticeable than like not updating per frame.

713
00:44:14,428 --> 00:44:16,728
Then we've got some things that some really awesome,

714
00:44:16,848 --> 00:44:19,389
I, you know, it's really cool that they figure out

715
00:44:19,409 --> 00:44:20,789
how to do things only on the GPU.

716
00:44:20,849 --> 00:44:23,430
Unfortunately, there is no data for us to tie into.

717
00:44:23,570 --> 00:44:25,791
So we had to write all these new systems to,

718
00:44:27,044 --> 00:44:29,766
get, you know, basically query what's happening on the GPU

719
00:44:29,826 --> 00:44:31,768
and pass that to the CPU so we can do something with it.

720
00:44:32,789 --> 00:44:33,990
There's a whole bunch of behaviors

721
00:44:34,690 --> 00:44:37,553
and that we need to cover for each of these pieces,

722
00:44:37,573 --> 00:44:38,874
you know, when the whole building's blowing up.

723
00:44:39,274 --> 00:44:40,675
And then there's a tremendous scale,

724
00:44:40,755 --> 00:44:43,338
tens of thousands of objects are updating across the network.

725
00:44:44,619 --> 00:44:45,720
They all have a different state,

726
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:47,041
they have a position and orientation,

727
00:44:47,201 --> 00:44:48,462
and there's a huge range from,

728
00:44:49,242 --> 00:44:51,344
I think there's even smaller than 50 kilograms now,

729
00:44:51,684 --> 00:44:54,507
but 50 kilograms to like a billion or whatever is the max.

730
00:44:54,567 --> 00:44:54,867
It's just.

731
00:44:55,687 --> 00:44:57,948
we need to make its hard bank concrete sound huge.

732
00:44:58,108 --> 00:45:00,109
So we have to do that all in real time.

733
00:45:00,869 --> 00:45:02,110
All right, so there's physics chunks,

734
00:45:02,330 --> 00:45:04,250
GPU chunks, static geometry,

735
00:45:04,290 --> 00:45:06,431
which is like the ground that can't be destroyed.

736
00:45:07,432 --> 00:45:09,412
And then we've got impacts, destroys,

737
00:45:09,913 --> 00:45:11,293
and we've got a value of impulse.

738
00:45:14,674 --> 00:45:17,375
We do it all because of the nature

739
00:45:17,535 --> 00:45:18,896
of how the team is so distributed.

740
00:45:18,976 --> 00:45:20,697
We try to do as much as possible and wise.

741
00:45:21,357 --> 00:45:21,557
So.

742
00:45:22,795 --> 00:45:25,941
Every physics sound in the entire game for impact is a single event call.

743
00:45:26,381 --> 00:45:27,744
It's play physics impact.

744
00:45:28,405 --> 00:45:32,612
And everything we do underneath that is driven by data that we query from the game and set

745
00:45:32,632 --> 00:45:34,396
a parameter to drive a switch.

746
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,448
So we hate the switch view.

747
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:41,451
Like with a fiery passion, we wish that Wwise would fix it

748
00:45:41,471 --> 00:45:43,232
because it's terrible.

749
00:45:43,352 --> 00:45:44,333
It's extremely powerful.

750
00:45:45,034 --> 00:45:46,435
And you can do a lot with it.

751
00:45:46,495 --> 00:45:49,618
But actually dragging things and having to reorder things

752
00:45:49,658 --> 00:45:52,019
and the fact that you can't sort to actually see what

753
00:45:52,039 --> 00:45:54,461
you're doing is like nightmare inducing.

754
00:45:56,163 --> 00:45:58,225
But the cool thing is you can do layers, and it'll make

755
00:45:58,265 --> 00:45:59,325
stuff on the fly for you.

756
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,127
It's got a lot of functionality built into it.

757
00:46:02,144 --> 00:46:04,286
So we nest the switches.

758
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,047
So the first thing we do is the material,

759
00:46:06,647 --> 00:46:07,388
and then we do the mass.

760
00:46:07,608 --> 00:46:11,091
So it'd be like physics impact is the action.

761
00:46:11,811 --> 00:46:14,613
Then we do carbon dark as the material.

762
00:46:15,254 --> 00:46:17,415
And then we do the size, carbon dark huge.

763
00:46:17,856 --> 00:46:19,537
And then we go through all the impulse levels

764
00:46:19,757 --> 00:46:20,397
under that switch.

765
00:46:20,558 --> 00:46:22,799
And then we define what sounds can play

766
00:46:23,019 --> 00:46:23,660
at each one of those.

767
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:25,781
So that as you can imagine, our switches,

768
00:46:25,821 --> 00:46:26,762
I should have done a zoomed out view,

769
00:46:26,782 --> 00:46:28,583
but our switch view is enormous.

770
00:46:31,034 --> 00:46:35,756
Fortunately, adding materials is extremely expensive

771
00:46:35,776 --> 00:46:37,977
for every department, so they kept the number of materials

772
00:46:38,017 --> 00:46:40,078
down to a reasonable amount because there were so many

773
00:46:40,138 --> 00:46:42,539
actions and so many mass ranges that we had to cover.

774
00:46:45,181 --> 00:46:47,602
Because we have to make actual sounds to represent

775
00:46:47,642 --> 00:46:49,083
the stuff we can't physically model

776
00:46:49,123 --> 00:46:51,284
or procedurally generate it, we have tried that in the past.

777
00:46:51,364 --> 00:46:53,665
It just doesn't sound as good as a sound designer

778
00:46:53,685 --> 00:46:55,626
putting their creativity in and making it sound

779
00:46:55,646 --> 00:46:57,147
the way you want it to sound as opposed to how

780
00:46:57,187 --> 00:46:59,288
it should physically sound, like physically correct.

781
00:47:01,062 --> 00:47:07,005
We take ranges of mass and we assign them to a single sound.

782
00:47:07,045 --> 00:47:09,566
So there's tiny, small, medium, large, huge,

783
00:47:09,627 --> 00:47:10,807
and then we even added enormous

784
00:47:10,847 --> 00:47:12,988
because we're running out of words

785
00:47:13,048 --> 00:47:14,709
to describe the mass range.

786
00:47:15,750 --> 00:47:17,611
But it's better than like zero, one, two, three, four, five.

787
00:47:18,891 --> 00:47:22,373
So by taking a range of masses and saying,

788
00:47:22,593 --> 00:47:24,514
this is what we say is a medium sound,

789
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,935
we know what sound to make for that size.

790
00:47:28,574 --> 00:47:31,516
Then within the range, the min and max range of that mass,

791
00:47:32,136 --> 00:47:34,297
we track another parameter, which is the percentage,

792
00:47:34,317 --> 00:47:37,258
and we can use that to sort of pitch it up or down slightly

793
00:47:37,358 --> 00:47:38,979
to give it a little more gradient.

794
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:40,800
So it's not just like, you know,

795
00:47:41,360 --> 00:47:42,881
some of the ranges are actually quite large.

796
00:47:42,941 --> 00:47:44,362
So being able to pitch it a little bit

797
00:47:44,402 --> 00:47:47,183
and give it a little more variety is much appreciated.

798
00:47:47,903 --> 00:47:49,124
So we do the same thing with impulse.

799
00:47:49,264 --> 00:47:49,824
There's a range.

800
00:47:50,184 --> 00:47:50,885
We have to bucket it,

801
00:47:50,905 --> 00:47:53,466
because we have to make a finite amount of content.

802
00:47:56,730 --> 00:47:58,851
Then we've got a bunch of behaviors.

803
00:47:58,871 --> 00:48:01,492
It can be damage destroyed, it can move through the air,

804
00:48:02,492 --> 00:48:04,293
it can scrape on the ground, it can hit stuff,

805
00:48:04,353 --> 00:48:07,535
and then they clean it up, and we call that a de-res,

806
00:48:07,735 --> 00:48:11,317
just like Tron, because it looks like Tron.

807
00:48:13,818 --> 00:48:14,758
I'm gonna skip all this stuff,

808
00:48:14,798 --> 00:48:16,439
because you know what ballistic damage is.

809
00:48:18,383 --> 00:48:21,004
This is, so destroyed is not when it's actually deleted,

810
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:24,346
that's a derez, destroyed is when any physics chunk

811
00:48:24,406 --> 00:48:26,787
breaks into two or more smaller chunks.

812
00:48:28,207 --> 00:48:29,668
And so it's basically, if you can think of it

813
00:48:29,708 --> 00:48:32,169
as something fracturing, it's just called a destroy.

814
00:48:33,649 --> 00:48:35,510
Turbulence is cool and I'm gonna get into more detail

815
00:48:35,550 --> 00:48:38,031
on that, but basically as Havoc bodies are moving

816
00:48:38,051 --> 00:48:39,091
through the air, you wanna hear a moosh.

817
00:48:40,212 --> 00:48:42,553
And we do full contact sets for every single

818
00:48:43,013 --> 00:48:44,634
mass range and speed you can have.

819
00:48:47,260 --> 00:48:51,521
An impact is if a physics chunk collides with either a physics chunk or static geometry,

820
00:48:52,921 --> 00:48:53,662
then play a sound.

821
00:48:54,222 --> 00:48:59,023
That sound, that system is designed to be two hands clapping, so I've got this thing

822
00:48:59,103 --> 00:49:01,384
hit something and this thing was hit by something.

823
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:03,264
Now you get a sound.

824
00:49:03,884 --> 00:49:07,826
That sound is not a single sound that we say like, oh, it's concrete versus glass at this

825
00:49:07,846 --> 00:49:08,466
speed and everything.

826
00:49:08,866 --> 00:49:12,027
It's the sound of concrete hitting something and the sound of glass being hit by something.

827
00:49:12,347 --> 00:49:14,127
And we play them both at the same place, same time.

828
00:49:14,688 --> 00:49:15,488
So it's actually two.

829
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:18,179
Both objects register their sound that they should play.

830
00:49:18,500 --> 00:49:21,440
Because it's same play, same time, you get an aggregate sound that sounds correct.

831
00:49:24,321 --> 00:49:25,321
We have a bunch of different layers.

832
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:28,442
That's so we can get perspective on the sound and tune it differently.

833
00:49:29,122 --> 00:49:33,062
Impact, resonance, which would be like if it's a piece of metal, it's the ringing of the metal.

834
00:49:34,343 --> 00:49:36,983
Sweetener would be like, hey, it's a piece of concrete and some chunks fly off,

835
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:39,404
so we want to get a little bit of dust and grit and debris on there.

836
00:49:39,924 --> 00:49:42,464
And then LFE, we do for sizes above medium.

837
00:49:43,605 --> 00:49:44,145
Medium and above?

838
00:49:44,165 --> 00:49:44,245
Yeah.

839
00:49:46,641 --> 00:49:49,582
And the huge ones we really just kick your room with a lot of air.

840
00:49:50,162 --> 00:49:50,683
That's awesome.

841
00:49:51,523 --> 00:49:54,444
If you have a 5.1 system, this is a great game to showcase it with,

842
00:49:54,885 --> 00:49:56,505
because we went crazy with LFE.

843
00:49:57,846 --> 00:49:58,546
And LFE's fun.

844
00:49:58,987 --> 00:50:02,388
Alright, scrape is...

845
00:50:02,688 --> 00:50:05,910
So if a turbulence is in motion and not colliding with something,

846
00:50:06,410 --> 00:50:08,911
then a scrape is it's in motion and colliding with something.

847
00:50:09,492 --> 00:50:09,932
Pretty simple.

848
00:50:10,272 --> 00:50:10,692
Conditions.

849
00:50:11,172 --> 00:50:12,213
It's really hard to tune.

850
00:50:12,533 --> 00:50:14,074
That was actually our most problematic system,

851
00:50:14,114 --> 00:50:14,374
because...

852
00:50:15,297 --> 00:50:17,477
on the server, getting data back from the server to say,

853
00:50:17,517 --> 00:50:19,718
hey, I've done like a bunch of collisions

854
00:50:19,778 --> 00:50:20,718
in a very small window.

855
00:50:20,738 --> 00:50:21,499
Should I play a scrape?

856
00:50:22,699 --> 00:50:25,540
Is still our most problematic system.

857
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:27,421
And it's just OK.

858
00:50:27,841 --> 00:50:30,402
But it's kind of nice when something is hitting and sort

859
00:50:30,422 --> 00:50:32,563
of rotating and falling that you get the impact.

860
00:50:32,623 --> 00:50:34,983
And then it's got a little bit of a scrape until it falls.

861
00:50:35,023 --> 00:50:35,244
It's cool.

862
00:50:35,264 --> 00:50:38,545
All right, so this is an example of, with all that

863
00:50:38,585 --> 00:50:40,325
working, just destruction audio.

864
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:42,126
So no weapons and no building level stuff.

865
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:27,185
The game designers were super nice and they decided that when anything should break, they

866
00:51:27,205 --> 00:51:29,748
should just play an explosion, which was really nice for audio.

867
00:51:31,210 --> 00:51:33,232
And so that's why you're seeing so many explosions.

868
00:51:34,153 --> 00:51:35,875
So that's just destruction audio only.

869
00:51:36,376 --> 00:51:40,561
Here's with everything, weapons and everything all in one.

870
00:52:16,564 --> 00:52:18,084
And this is all test level stuff.

871
00:52:18,445 --> 00:52:20,446
In a normal match, there's 10 players all trying to kill

872
00:52:20,466 --> 00:52:21,346
each other and shooting stuff.

873
00:52:21,747 --> 00:52:25,829
So the audio director in me gets obsessed over the

874
00:52:25,869 --> 00:52:27,610
details, and I'm like, there's stuff I didn't hear.

875
00:52:28,931 --> 00:52:31,613
You have to kind of go, yeah, but.

876
00:52:31,673 --> 00:52:35,796
You're never going to actually hear that that isn't playing,

877
00:52:35,836 --> 00:52:37,737
that one little thing that rotated and fell.

878
00:52:37,957 --> 00:52:39,618
So we did try to get all that stuff.

879
00:52:39,938 --> 00:52:41,839
Just sometimes we have to make some hard decisions about

880
00:52:41,879 --> 00:52:42,640
what's most important.

881
00:52:42,940 --> 00:52:43,420
I'll get to that.

882
00:52:45,669 --> 00:52:46,910
Oh, and then we just play it.

883
00:52:47,070 --> 00:52:48,611
We use the server cleanup

884
00:52:51,573 --> 00:52:52,694
as a sound design opportunity.

885
00:52:54,636 --> 00:52:55,556
All right, so buildings.

886
00:52:55,836 --> 00:52:57,177
So those are all the destruction chunks.

887
00:52:57,197 --> 00:52:58,118
That's all the little pieces.

888
00:52:58,198 --> 00:52:59,619
That was probably the hardest thing to get.

889
00:52:59,719 --> 00:53:01,500
Then we can query the state of a building.

890
00:53:02,201 --> 00:53:04,162
A building is a collection of pieces

891
00:53:04,903 --> 00:53:06,824
fused together through constrained joints.

892
00:53:07,525 --> 00:53:09,126
And once you damage it enough,

893
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,367
it will enter into different states.

894
00:53:12,028 --> 00:53:12,768
Those states are below.

895
00:53:14,350 --> 00:53:16,011
We have sound designs for each one of those states.

896
00:53:16,311 --> 00:53:19,573
Here's sort of the definitions of how those building states

897
00:53:19,633 --> 00:53:19,833
work.

898
00:53:20,793 --> 00:53:21,433
It was really simple.

899
00:53:21,453 --> 00:53:23,354
We were like, hey, at 33% and 66%,

900
00:53:24,335 --> 00:53:27,336
can we just start triggering some sounds?

901
00:53:27,376 --> 00:53:29,377
And basically, where there's constraints,

902
00:53:29,397 --> 00:53:31,638
we can start to play creaks, and we randomize where they are.

903
00:53:31,718 --> 00:53:33,038
So when you're in a building, you

904
00:53:33,058 --> 00:53:34,819
can tell that it's starting to take damage.

905
00:53:34,979 --> 00:53:37,800
So that you don't hang out in there too long

906
00:53:37,840 --> 00:53:40,501
and get crushed to death is the real idea.

907
00:53:40,541 --> 00:53:41,142
So there's critical.

908
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:47,001
The server can handle one building collapsing in its entirety at one point in time.

909
00:53:47,382 --> 00:53:51,964
So if two buildings have been damaged enough to come down, one of the second one is queued.

910
00:53:52,585 --> 00:53:56,007
And so it enters into a special state, says like, dude, I'm totally going to come down

911
00:53:56,147 --> 00:53:57,408
as soon as the other one's done.

912
00:53:58,128 --> 00:53:59,789
And we have a system for that.

913
00:54:02,391 --> 00:54:03,412
And then we have a building collapse.

914
00:54:05,233 --> 00:54:06,934
So here's just building destruction.

915
00:54:07,174 --> 00:54:09,475
All the physics sounds are muted in this one.

916
00:54:31,523 --> 00:54:34,725
Cool, so we can't really cheat in this game,

917
00:54:34,745 --> 00:54:37,506
because you can go all over the place.

918
00:54:37,526 --> 00:54:38,887
Like, we don't constrain the player at all,

919
00:54:39,367 --> 00:54:40,368
especially in multiplayer.

920
00:54:40,408 --> 00:54:42,869
So we actually had to figure out a way

921
00:54:42,909 --> 00:54:44,750
to get all the sounds positioned on the structures

922
00:54:44,810 --> 00:54:45,711
and do everything correctly.

923
00:54:46,851 --> 00:54:48,772
When the server reports that a building is collapsing,

924
00:54:48,812 --> 00:54:50,193
we have that shepherd tone that keeps coming in.

925
00:54:50,233 --> 00:54:51,453
So it always feels like it's falling.

926
00:54:52,334 --> 00:54:54,355
And then when the server says, hey, you've stopped,

927
00:54:54,395 --> 00:54:55,315
that's when you hear it fade out.

928
00:54:57,076 --> 00:54:58,097
Just a simple little trick.

929
00:54:58,137 --> 00:54:59,717
We used a lot of shepherd tone in.

930
00:55:01,334 --> 00:55:01,814
in Crackdown 3.

931
00:55:33,519 --> 00:55:33,740
Cool.

932
00:55:34,967 --> 00:55:36,796
And then this is a full simulation, just a whole

933
00:55:36,816 --> 00:55:37,479
building coming down.

934
00:55:57,504 --> 00:56:02,165
So not perfect, but I don't know, pretty awesome considering the technical challenges to get there.

935
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:07,787
And then the last part, I'll blast through this, performance tuning was super hard. So basically

936
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:11,929
with tens of thousands of things happening, the first, when we first started this, we were like,

937
00:56:11,949 --> 00:56:15,010
can you just send everything to us and we'll work it out on the client? And they were like,

938
00:56:15,410 --> 00:56:19,752
sure, we'll turn that, we'll turn on audio and pass the parameters that you asked for.

939
00:56:20,172 --> 00:56:24,273
And we completely took down the server. And so then they were like, man, you guys took down

940
00:56:24,293 --> 00:56:26,314
the server. You don't get any data.

941
00:56:27,289 --> 00:56:29,270
And we were like, well, we need something.

942
00:56:29,350 --> 00:56:34,272
So between some and none, or all and none,

943
00:56:34,772 --> 00:56:36,773
we needed to figure out what was the right amount of stuff

944
00:56:36,833 --> 00:56:39,555
to hit server performance and also give us enough

945
00:56:39,575 --> 00:56:41,476
so that we can do something convincing for the player.

946
00:56:42,836 --> 00:56:44,557
So we do a whole bunch of relevance checks.

947
00:56:45,318 --> 00:56:46,978
I'm gonna have to go through that quickly

948
00:56:46,998 --> 00:56:47,879
because I talk too long.

949
00:56:49,300 --> 00:56:53,782
But the way that it's done is we take everything,

950
00:56:54,782 --> 00:56:57,424
And we look at, we start bucketing things,

951
00:56:57,464 --> 00:56:59,325
and we say, in this bucket you can have this many,

952
00:56:59,986 --> 00:57:01,867
and here's how we determine what's most important,

953
00:57:01,907 --> 00:57:02,828
and then it can graduate out,

954
00:57:02,888 --> 00:57:04,329
and we filter, filter, filter, filter,

955
00:57:04,369 --> 00:57:09,053
and down to what is most important to send to the player,

956
00:57:09,113 --> 00:57:12,996
because server bandwidth is precious in a multiplayer game.

957
00:57:14,157 --> 00:57:15,238
Once it gets to the server,

958
00:57:17,459 --> 00:57:19,221
so one, oh, sorry, one of the ways that we do that

959
00:57:19,281 --> 00:57:21,542
is we merge collisions as they get farther away from you.

960
00:57:21,683 --> 00:57:22,623
So you need a lot of precision,

961
00:57:22,643 --> 00:57:24,345
like I'm standing right there in one little chunk column,

962
00:57:24,738 --> 00:57:25,698
you know, falls and hits the ground.

963
00:57:25,758 --> 00:57:27,499
I wanna hear it like right then, I don't wanna wait.

964
00:57:28,019 --> 00:57:30,440
The more you merge, the more latency you're introducing

965
00:57:30,500 --> 00:57:33,381
to the sound, because the server has to accumulate

966
00:57:33,401 --> 00:57:34,681
a certain number of impacts and then say,

967
00:57:35,061 --> 00:57:37,102
hey, here's a merged impact for all this stuff.

968
00:57:37,602 --> 00:57:40,523
So as it gets farther away, we increase the radius on those.

969
00:57:40,743 --> 00:57:42,064
That's a really nice optimization.

970
00:57:42,544 --> 00:57:43,844
We got a ton back from that.

971
00:57:44,184 --> 00:57:46,385
And we also bias that towards the view frustum of the player.

972
00:57:47,321 --> 00:57:48,662
which has helped a lot.

973
00:57:48,942 --> 00:57:50,543
So if you, basically it was like,

974
00:57:51,263 --> 00:57:52,644
when it was just a sphere around the player,

975
00:57:52,964 --> 00:57:54,906
things behind me were totally taking precedence

976
00:57:54,926 --> 00:57:57,007
because they were huge or fast or something

977
00:57:57,627 --> 00:57:58,888
over the stuff that I wanted to see.

978
00:58:00,789 --> 00:58:01,469
But that all had to be,

979
00:58:01,610 --> 00:58:02,930
all that logic had to be done on the server.

980
00:58:04,071 --> 00:58:06,993
So on the client side, we do all that whole process again

981
00:58:07,013 --> 00:58:10,095
because even the stuff that can come to the client

982
00:58:11,055 --> 00:58:11,756
can swamp wise.

983
00:58:13,729 --> 00:58:16,391
On the Y side, we do that again, but for voices.

984
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:19,093
So we still like, all right, only this can come

985
00:58:19,113 --> 00:58:20,934
from the server, only this can get to Y's,

986
00:58:21,134 --> 00:58:22,175
and then once Y's is there, it's like,

987
00:58:22,275 --> 00:58:23,856
I can't really play back all that stuff,

988
00:58:23,976 --> 00:58:27,538
so I'm gonna do my, you know, the most important stuff

989
00:58:27,558 --> 00:58:29,119
of what's left, I'm gonna play sounds for those.

990
00:58:29,719 --> 00:58:31,500
And we aggressively limit and throw out sounds

991
00:58:31,520 --> 00:58:32,061
that we don't want.

992
00:58:32,701 --> 00:58:34,683
We have a priority system for every single voice,

993
00:58:34,923 --> 00:58:37,764
and so it's a gradient between how heavy it is

994
00:58:37,784 --> 00:58:39,966
and how much impulse it is and what material it is.

995
00:58:40,902 --> 00:58:45,007
If you want to dig into this later, these are the actual numbers we use for how we limit

996
00:58:45,047 --> 00:58:46,208
how many instances come through.

997
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:12,665
And then this is just to show you how extreme it can get.

998
00:59:12,705 --> 00:59:15,211
So this is a building with all the physics stuff simulating

999
00:59:15,692 --> 00:59:17,055
and the player still interacting with it,

1000
00:59:17,095 --> 00:59:18,900
like still smashing it up as it's collapsing.

1001
00:59:47,255 --> 00:59:49,878
All right, and you can do that at 30 Hertz on an Xbox One,

1002
00:59:49,898 --> 00:59:51,319
which is the miracle part.

1003
00:59:51,559 --> 00:59:52,100
So it's pretty cool.

1004
00:59:52,961 --> 00:59:56,165
All right, so turbulence, if something's moving and it's

1005
00:59:56,205 --> 00:59:58,327
not colliding with anything, it's turbulating.

1006
01:00:00,329 --> 01:00:01,430
This has a lot of physics in it.

1007
01:00:01,550 --> 01:00:03,953
Bad guys throw physics objects at you as weapons.

1008
01:00:04,013 --> 01:00:04,754
You can throw stuff.

1009
01:00:04,774 --> 01:00:06,316
You can blow things up into smaller parts, and

1010
01:00:06,336 --> 01:00:06,956
they fly all over.

1011
01:00:07,605 --> 01:00:10,065
I'm going to quickly get to some examples.

1012
01:00:10,126 --> 01:00:15,927
So real quick, this is the scale of which every single little section you see here has

1013
01:00:16,107 --> 01:00:16,708
props in it.

1014
01:00:16,748 --> 01:00:18,088
There was a million billion.

1015
01:00:19,388 --> 01:00:23,610
This is an example of the spreadsheet that James managed to track it.

1016
01:00:24,130 --> 01:00:25,150
I'm going to do the zoom out.

1017
01:00:25,210 --> 01:00:26,490
Yes, there's that.

1018
01:00:26,671 --> 01:00:29,471
And then, oh God, why did they make so many props?

1019
01:00:31,592 --> 01:00:34,653
And for most of those, we made unique content.

1020
01:00:34,993 --> 01:00:35,193
It was 700.

1021
01:00:38,558 --> 01:00:41,139
Yeah, somewhere around 700 unique props

1022
01:00:41,879 --> 01:00:43,580
that had a full set of everything

1023
01:00:43,780 --> 01:00:45,221
from impacts to turbulence.

1024
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:46,281
Pretty cool.

1025
01:00:46,661 --> 01:00:49,783
And then that's outside of the destruction materials

1026
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:50,583
and all that kind of stuff.

1027
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:54,765
And we dynamically load those banks,

1028
01:00:54,825 --> 01:00:56,306
that's, you can imagine.

1029
01:00:57,446 --> 01:00:59,587
So here's what you get with turbulence.

1030
01:01:04,129 --> 01:01:04,609
Pretty cool.

1031
01:01:05,879 --> 01:01:10,304
Guys like Ben, Sightless Combat, can now tell when physics objects are flying around.

1032
01:01:13,227 --> 01:01:17,152
Here's throwing a pipe.

1033
01:01:18,473 --> 01:01:22,938
Here's a really cool one that shows off how we take the rotational velocity of an object

1034
01:01:23,239 --> 01:01:24,100
and we modulate the sound.

1035
01:01:33,030 --> 01:01:34,691
Damn that last tip over, I wish we, I wish,

1036
01:01:35,071 --> 01:01:36,432
the tip overs are the hardest

1037
01:01:36,472 --> 01:01:38,513
cause it's in contact with something

1038
01:01:38,553 --> 01:01:41,094
and so Havoc doesn't give us the right data.

1039
01:01:41,894 --> 01:01:44,516
And then, oh, this is probably the coolest sounding one,

1040
01:01:44,536 --> 01:01:45,316
it's a piece of sheet metal.

1041
01:01:45,756 --> 01:01:47,497
And as you throw it, you throw it like a discus

1042
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,378
and so it spins and this shows off

1043
01:01:49,758 --> 01:01:51,619
what the rotational velocity is about.

1044
01:01:55,805 --> 01:01:58,267
Pretty cool, it's super simple, it's actually not expensive,

1045
01:01:59,028 --> 01:02:00,489
and we have all that content now,

1046
01:02:00,549 --> 01:02:03,291
so it's good, because other people can use it.

1047
01:02:05,673 --> 01:02:07,735
This just shows that we also do it for destruction objects.

1048
01:02:11,758 --> 01:02:12,278
I'm out of time?

1049
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:12,739
Yeah.

1050
01:02:13,039 --> 01:02:14,260
Okay, can I go five minutes over?

1051
01:02:14,280 --> 01:02:21,586
Okay, I wanna get to our mix stuff.

1052
01:02:23,547 --> 01:02:24,028
I'm gonna cheat.

1053
01:02:24,427 --> 01:02:25,688
LFE, we play some LFEs.

1054
01:02:25,708 --> 01:02:31,529
All right, so the mix stuff, we wanted,

1055
01:02:32,549 --> 01:02:33,610
player feedback is essential,

1056
01:02:34,150 --> 01:02:36,050
but we wanted the music to be nice and up in the mix.

1057
01:02:36,430 --> 01:02:37,731
That creates contentions.

1058
01:02:38,271 --> 01:02:39,691
You've also got narrators, as you heard,

1059
01:02:39,711 --> 01:02:40,651
they just talk all the time.

1060
01:02:40,831 --> 01:02:42,272
We need to make sure that you hear everything they say.

1061
01:02:43,232 --> 01:02:45,032
And then we just wanted to reduce cacophony noise.

1062
01:02:45,453 --> 01:02:46,753
We use Weiss HDR.

1063
01:02:46,933 --> 01:02:48,673
I know some people are saying they don't like it.

1064
01:02:48,973 --> 01:02:49,454
I love it.

1065
01:02:49,534 --> 01:02:51,074
This game would not have been possible without it.

1066
01:02:51,674 --> 01:02:54,420
But it's not easy. It's really hard. You can't just grab a fader and be like,

1067
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:58,408
I want this to be quiet. You have to do all the math in your head and think of it in three dimensions.

1068
01:02:58,448 --> 01:03:03,258
It's horrible. But the good news is once you get it right, the game just stays clean sounding.

1069
01:03:05,297 --> 01:03:06,697
We do frequency domain processing,

1070
01:03:06,837 --> 01:03:09,198
much like the Just Cause guys,

1071
01:03:10,418 --> 01:03:12,419
where depending on what's happening,

1072
01:03:12,439 --> 01:03:13,560
we'll carve out some frequencies.

1073
01:03:13,640 --> 01:03:14,620
So if you can think of,

1074
01:03:15,160 --> 01:03:17,601
hey, I don't wanna duck the music when someone talks super,

1075
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:20,822
you know, like six to nine dB, like you would need to

1076
01:03:20,862 --> 01:03:22,343
when you have the music nice and up in the mix,

1077
01:03:22,843 --> 01:03:25,384
but it competes with the melody.

1078
01:03:25,424 --> 01:03:27,745
So I can bring the melody down, leave the perk on the bass,

1079
01:03:27,985 --> 01:03:29,825
because there's no frequency contention there.

1080
01:03:30,325 --> 01:03:31,626
And then all I need to do is on the.

1081
01:03:32,333 --> 01:03:35,555
percussion, just really the hi-hat is competing with the

1082
01:03:36,195 --> 01:03:38,456
audibility, like the sibilance, so I just use a notch.

1083
01:03:39,016 --> 01:03:42,638
Like I use the meter on the output of the speech to pull

1084
01:03:42,658 --> 01:03:43,198
these things down.

1085
01:03:43,258 --> 01:03:46,639
So if we did our magic right, you wouldn't notice.

1086
01:03:46,799 --> 01:03:49,160
You can notice a little bit, but it's not as bad as some

1087
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,121
games I've worked on where we've had to just dump the

1088
01:03:51,161 --> 01:03:52,221
music so you can hear the voice.

1089
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:57,343
We also do some category to category things, like hey, if

1090
01:03:57,423 --> 01:03:59,584
I'm shooting a gun and an explosion goes off, the gun

1091
01:03:59,644 --> 01:04:00,625
can cut the lows on the.

1092
01:04:01,218 --> 01:04:02,599
The explosion can cut the lows on the gun,

1093
01:04:02,619 --> 01:04:04,321
and the guns can cut the highs on the explosion.

1094
01:04:04,661 --> 01:04:05,922
Super simple, and they just trade off.

1095
01:04:06,302 --> 01:04:07,283
And the meters are really fast.

1096
01:04:07,323 --> 01:04:09,785
We own fast meters on those, peak meters,

1097
01:04:10,085 --> 01:04:12,067
and they trade off very nicely.

1098
01:04:14,709 --> 01:04:16,410
HDR is great for sandboxes with chaos.

1099
01:04:18,292 --> 01:04:19,793
Every single sound in the game is 3D.

1100
01:04:19,833 --> 01:04:23,076
It was a decision that we made because I

1101
01:04:23,116 --> 01:04:24,497
think 3D sounds are awesome, and we

1102
01:04:24,537 --> 01:04:25,898
wanted to make something that could

1103
01:04:25,918 --> 01:04:27,539
be a showcase for spatial audio, which we're still

1104
01:04:27,559 --> 01:04:28,540
wrestling with some bugs on.

1105
01:04:28,580 --> 01:04:30,181
So if you play it today, you won't get that.

1106
01:04:30,670 --> 01:04:31,071
It's coming.

1107
01:04:34,873 --> 01:04:35,894
Yes, we use meters too.

1108
01:04:36,815 --> 01:04:38,556
Here's some information you can dig into later

1109
01:04:38,576 --> 01:04:40,877
about just some of the PEQs and ducking that we do.

1110
01:04:43,839 --> 01:04:44,680
Performance was horrible.

1111
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:45,501
You're not the only ones.

1112
01:04:45,561 --> 01:04:46,501
That's why this slide is here.

1113
01:04:47,162 --> 01:04:48,543
We aggressively throw sounds out.

1114
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:50,684
If they're at max distance, they're a zero priority.

1115
01:04:50,704 --> 01:04:51,465
We don't care about them.

1116
01:04:51,745 --> 01:04:53,186
We just care about the stuff that you should hear.

1117
01:04:54,046 --> 01:04:56,288
And we limit all of our sounds to 50 max.

1118
01:04:56,368 --> 01:04:58,049
This game, with all the things that can happen,

1119
01:04:58,089 --> 01:04:59,690
you only ever hear 50 maximum sounds.

1120
01:05:00,708 --> 01:05:05,353
And the way that we do that is through HDR for audibility and then priorities.

1121
01:05:06,715 --> 01:05:08,797
Believe me, you can't tell that we only have 50 voices playing.

1122
01:05:08,817 --> 01:05:09,218
It's crazy.

1123
01:05:09,538 --> 01:05:11,641
I was inspired, I was challenged by Bungie because

1124
01:05:12,350 --> 01:05:15,831
not challenged by them, but challenged in knowing that they limit their voices to somewhere

1125
01:05:15,851 --> 01:05:17,132
in the 40s for Destiny.

1126
01:05:17,232 --> 01:05:17,792
I'm like, how?

1127
01:05:18,212 --> 01:05:19,032
I played that game.

1128
01:05:19,072 --> 01:05:19,592
It's impossible.

1129
01:05:19,952 --> 01:05:21,133
So I just want to thank everyone.

1130
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:27,474
If anyone here worked on Nimbus, that was the code name, or our friends overseas that

1131
01:05:27,854 --> 01:05:29,635
worked very hard on this game, I just wanted to thank you.

1132
01:05:29,655 --> 01:05:32,775
It was a long journey, and there was a lot of dedication from the audio team on this.

1133
01:05:33,276 --> 01:05:33,796
I love you guys.

1134
01:05:34,076 --> 01:05:34,436
Love you all.

1135
01:05:34,456 --> 01:05:34,676
Thank you.

1136
01:05:34,856 --> 01:05:34,976
Thanks.

1137
01:05:34,996 --> 01:05:35,196
Thank you.
