1
00:00:05,752 --> 00:00:10,614
Okay, hi, my name is Jonny Jungstedt, I'm art director at DICE.

2
00:00:10,614 --> 00:00:15,175
And I'm here today to talk you through the journey I was to make a Starlight's Edge,

3
00:00:15,175 --> 00:00:17,396
Starlight's Game, like Mirror's Edge.

4
00:00:17,396 --> 00:00:23,198
Everything from an idea to how it was conceptualized, and how we then iterated and refined the style,

5
00:00:23,198 --> 00:00:24,738
and then how it ended up in the game.

6
00:00:24,738 --> 00:00:26,979
So this is not going to be a technical talk in any way,

7
00:00:26,979 --> 00:00:31,740
it's going to be purely focused on the aesthetics and the design process around this,

8
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,921
and how we were thinking about making the universe.

9
00:00:34,895 --> 00:00:38,818
And if you want to know more about the technical aspect,

10
00:00:38,818 --> 00:00:41,540
then you can listen to Fabian Kristins presentation

11
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,001
he held earlier this year in San Francisco.

12
00:00:43,001 --> 00:00:45,864
So first, short about me then.

13
00:00:45,864 --> 00:00:49,286
So I've been now in the gaming industry for 15, 16 years.

14
00:00:49,286 --> 00:00:52,909
And actually, most of those years have been here at ICE.

15
00:00:52,909 --> 00:00:54,810
So it's a great company.

16
00:00:54,810 --> 00:00:55,991
I can highly recommend it.

17
00:00:55,991 --> 00:00:59,594
I guess I've been doing the most things

18
00:00:59,594 --> 00:01:00,535
you can do as an artist.

19
00:01:00,535 --> 00:01:02,196
I started as a 3D modeler.

20
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:04,698
And actually, the first game I made was.

21
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:07,873
a game called Legacy on Rosemont Hill.

22
00:01:07,873 --> 00:01:11,494
That was a horse game for ten year old girls.

23
00:01:11,494 --> 00:01:15,095
And don't ask me why we did that one, but it was a game.

24
00:01:15,095 --> 00:01:20,376
Actually, the first game I made for DICE was a game called Shrek.

25
00:01:20,376 --> 00:01:22,116
It was done to the GameCube.

26
00:01:22,116 --> 00:01:25,457
And a few young people here may be don't know what a GameCube is,

27
00:01:25,457 --> 00:01:29,038
but that was a console that existed a long time ago.

28
00:01:29,038 --> 00:01:32,979
And actually, that game actually scored

29
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:34,839
three out of ten by IGN.

30
00:01:35,649 --> 00:01:40,535
Maybe not my proudest moment in life but at least it gave me a chance to work with games

31
00:01:40,535 --> 00:01:43,458
and I started to get an understanding for how it is to work with it.

32
00:01:43,458 --> 00:01:47,503
It gives me some really nice... I just wanted to learn more about it.

33
00:01:48,179 --> 00:01:53,163
So then I learned level art, and then moved on to VFX,

34
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:56,825
did lighting, character art, and then became a lead artist

35
00:01:56,825 --> 00:02:00,708
on Bat Company 2 in Vietnam, and then after that,

36
00:02:00,708 --> 00:02:05,011
art director on Medal of Honor, some Battlefield expansion

37
00:02:05,011 --> 00:02:08,213
packs, and now art director on Mirage Catalyst.

38
00:02:08,213 --> 00:02:10,795
So that's all my journey.

39
00:02:10,795 --> 00:02:11,775
So if we just quickly can raise your hands,

40
00:02:11,775 --> 00:02:16,258
how many of you actually played the first Mirage Edge game?

41
00:02:17,715 --> 00:02:20,196
Oh, okay, great.

42
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:22,837
And I'm a new played Mirage Catalyst.

43
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:23,237
Okay, great.

44
00:02:23,237 --> 00:02:27,479
So actually, I can see that you already know

45
00:02:27,479 --> 00:02:31,921
a little bit about this universe already.

46
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:32,981
Let's just do a really quick recap.

47
00:02:32,981 --> 00:02:35,422
So the first Mirage came out in 2008.

48
00:02:35,422 --> 00:02:39,864
And it's quite iconic, quite distinct,

49
00:02:39,864 --> 00:02:41,505
you know, with the white city

50
00:02:41,505 --> 00:02:43,186
and the bold use of accent colors.

51
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:46,353
It was a first-person parkour game,

52
00:02:46,353 --> 00:02:49,554
where you heavily focus on the movement.

53
00:02:49,554 --> 00:02:51,315
And that game was actually done in Unreal.

54
00:02:51,315 --> 00:02:54,697
And there they pre-baked the light maps,

55
00:02:54,697 --> 00:02:57,078
which is what helped to create this really interesting

56
00:02:57,078 --> 00:03:02,581
stylized game in terms of light bounce and color bleeds.

57
00:03:02,581 --> 00:03:04,682
But that also meant that their level was going to be static.

58
00:03:04,682 --> 00:03:07,823
And their level design approach was more direct

59
00:03:07,823 --> 00:03:09,084
and it was more linear as well,

60
00:03:09,084 --> 00:03:12,105
versus what we wanted to do with Mirror Search Catalyst.

61
00:03:17,635 --> 00:03:19,875
Who's that in the window?

62
00:03:19,875 --> 00:03:23,176
It's a damn kid. Get her!

63
00:03:23,176 --> 00:03:25,536
Dogen sends his best.

64
00:03:25,536 --> 00:03:27,017
Enjoy your freedom.

65
00:03:27,017 --> 00:03:36,359
Faith Connors, wherever I turn, here you are.

66
00:03:36,359 --> 00:03:40,560
The only language you and your kind speak...

67
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,160
is destruction.

68
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:46,721
It's good to have you back, girl.

69
00:03:49,306 --> 00:03:52,907
I heard some runner got out of juvie today.

70
00:03:52,907 --> 00:03:55,168
What are you gonna do next?

71
00:03:55,168 --> 00:03:58,909
I'm gonna run.

72
00:03:58,909 --> 00:04:07,392
I'm gonna send a clear message to Kruger.

73
00:04:07,392 --> 00:04:09,872
Then you'll have to shoot me too!

74
00:04:09,872 --> 00:04:11,313
Come on, girl.

75
00:04:11,313 --> 00:04:13,093
Save us all.

76
00:04:47,813 --> 00:04:55,002
What is that?

77
00:04:55,002 --> 00:04:59,107
That is your future.

78
00:05:06,505 --> 00:05:07,965
So this was actually a reboot.

79
00:05:07,965 --> 00:05:10,066
Now we want to retell Faith's original story.

80
00:05:10,066 --> 00:05:13,606
We wanted you to give yourselves a chance to know

81
00:05:13,606 --> 00:05:16,867
more about Faith and her friends and his universe.

82
00:05:16,867 --> 00:05:20,088
And also, we wanted to create a more immersive

83
00:05:20,088 --> 00:05:22,689
storytelling, and that's why we moved away from 2D cutscenes

84
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,149
and then we made in-game renders instead.

85
00:05:24,149 --> 00:05:24,809
And we also want to give you.

86
00:05:28,312 --> 00:05:32,215
the freedom of choice. The freedom of choice of traversing the space the way we wanted

87
00:05:32,215 --> 00:05:35,599
you to do and just have fun in this massive city. So that's why we opened up the city

88
00:05:35,599 --> 00:05:40,343
much more for you as a player. And we also wanted to create a city that was dynamic and

89
00:05:40,343 --> 00:05:45,027
full of life. And that's why we investigated a lot of technology and time in developing

90
00:05:45,027 --> 00:05:50,953
the Thamuday systems, crowds, traffic, LMS, anything that will help us make this city

91
00:05:50,953 --> 00:05:52,555
feel very rich and very vibrant.

92
00:05:53,957 --> 00:05:56,659
So that meant that we couldn't pre-bake the lightmaps

93
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,320
that we did in the first game.

94
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,963
So even if we wanted to, we couldn't just recreate the look

95
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,444
from the original game.

96
00:06:03,444 --> 00:06:05,425
That's why we had to do something different.

97
00:06:05,425 --> 00:06:06,286
So we knew from day one that this game was

98
00:06:06,286 --> 00:06:08,087
going to be different.

99
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:12,150
Then I had to sort of establish the what, from a visual

100
00:06:12,150 --> 00:06:14,912
perspective, what's going to be different and why.

101
00:06:14,912 --> 00:06:17,733
Then how should we think about when we're

102
00:06:17,733 --> 00:06:19,495
creating this universe?

103
00:06:21,012 --> 00:06:24,314
And what we decided to go for was to create a very distinct style and tone.

104
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:31,259
And this style and tone was sort of going to be affecting everything we do from art, animation, design.

105
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:34,762
And this was sort of being the glue for this experience.

106
00:06:34,762 --> 00:06:37,664
And I guess here's what's the first lesson I learned.

107
00:06:37,664 --> 00:06:44,769
That is when you are working with a stylized game, it's really important you create very simple but clear design rules.

108
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:48,611
Define strong keywords, then you're going to use them over and over again on the team.

109
00:06:49,861 --> 00:06:53,164
And it was also about exposing them to images and mood boards.

110
00:06:53,164 --> 00:06:56,647
Anything that sort of reflected the style and the vibe that we were going for.

111
00:06:56,647 --> 00:07:00,531
We just filled the visual libraries with these images.

112
00:07:00,531 --> 00:07:04,955
Because essentially I just wanted the team to live and breathe this style and tone.

113
00:07:04,955 --> 00:07:08,098
And the keywords we decided to use for our style and tone

114
00:07:08,098 --> 00:07:11,942
was believable, it was elegant, and it was aptitude.

115
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:41,159
So we wanted to create a believable world, a world that the player can accept and can relate to.

116
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:43,962
So we just immerse ourselves in the fiction and in the story.

117
00:08:43,962 --> 00:08:50,608
So it was then important for us to ground it into something the player can recognize,

118
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:57,295
otherwise we would risk creating something that would feel surreal or artificial.

119
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,583
If you think about it, it would be impossible to keep a white world white the whole time,

120
00:09:02,583 --> 00:09:08,269
because the forces of nature, pollution, mankind, all of these things would affect it in some way.

121
00:09:08,269 --> 00:09:13,654
That's why, in order to keep it real, we have to make sure that we did add some wear and tear in there.

122
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:19,100
We need to use different tones of whites, and also we have to have a great understanding of how materials react to light.

123
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,482
That's why PBR helped us a lot.

124
00:09:23,390 --> 00:09:26,171
And our fiction is also taking place somewhere in the near future.

125
00:09:26,171 --> 00:09:31,855
So even though this world was going to feel futuristic, it was still important that it felt recognizable.

126
00:09:31,855 --> 00:09:37,519
So it was going to be a high-tech world, but we didn't want to push it so far so it became something that was sci-fi.

127
00:09:37,519 --> 00:09:41,181
And that's why I used this quote to sort of reinforce that.

128
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:46,084
And that was something Steven Spielberg said when he created his fiction for Minority Report.

129
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:49,006
That too was something that was taking place in the near future.

130
00:09:49,925 --> 00:09:54,086
And he said, you don't have to reinvent society in order to portray society.

131
00:09:54,086 --> 00:09:59,927
And that was exactly the mindset I wanted us to have when we created this fiction and this universe.

132
00:09:59,927 --> 00:10:05,968
You don't have to reinvent and redesign everything in order to make it feel like a stylized miniature game.

133
00:10:05,968 --> 00:10:08,969
That was really important for everyone to understand.

134
00:10:08,969 --> 00:10:13,730
So the ratio I use between believability and futuristic is sort of 70-30.

135
00:10:14,406 --> 00:10:19,050
So that meant that 70% of what we create,

136
00:10:19,050 --> 00:10:22,493
we can actually base or present them today.

137
00:10:22,493 --> 00:10:23,974
And then we just apply the other 30%,

138
00:10:23,974 --> 00:10:25,035
it's gonna make it feel like a stylized research game.

139
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:25,956
I also wanted to create an elegant world.

140
00:10:25,956 --> 00:10:31,821
A world that is bright, pristine, and exclusive.

141
00:10:31,821 --> 00:10:35,424
This is like a world taken to perfection.

142
00:10:35,424 --> 00:10:39,147
So elegant for us means it's white.

143
00:10:40,677 --> 00:10:44,359
And if you strip away all the details and all the unnecessary noise,

144
00:10:44,359 --> 00:10:46,960
take away the greys, the browns and the dirt,

145
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:49,921
by default, our game is going to feel elegant.

146
00:10:49,921 --> 00:10:51,382
It is going to feel inviting.

147
00:10:51,382 --> 00:10:52,823
And where elegance for me is us, as well, is minimalism.

148
00:10:52,823 --> 00:10:59,166
And I'm pretty sure all of you have heard the expression,

149
00:10:59,166 --> 00:11:00,486
less is more.

150
00:11:00,486 --> 00:11:03,828
And if any game would follow that, this would be that game.

151
00:11:06,503 --> 00:11:09,726
Because you don't understand, this society is all about control.

152
00:11:09,726 --> 00:11:13,609
The conglomerate of controlling the media, the broadcast,

153
00:11:13,609 --> 00:11:14,669
it's cameras everywhere.

154
00:11:14,669 --> 00:11:17,812
They tell you what to eat, what to wear, how to behave.

155
00:11:17,812 --> 00:11:21,695
And for me, minimalistic art style reflects that sense of control.

156
00:11:21,695 --> 00:11:26,979
It's about controlling your design, controlling your space,

157
00:11:26,979 --> 00:11:29,160
removing all unnecessary noise.

158
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,362
Just focus on the core of your design.

159
00:11:31,362 --> 00:11:33,864
And don't hide the flaws in more and more detail in there,

160
00:11:33,864 --> 00:11:35,085
like you do in other games.

161
00:11:37,503 --> 00:11:40,824
And by removing all this unnecessary noise,

162
00:11:40,824 --> 00:11:44,966
that's going to make something that feels very exclusive

163
00:11:44,966 --> 00:11:45,726
and very expensive.

164
00:11:45,726 --> 00:11:47,987
But you think, look at the bag there, for instance.

165
00:11:47,987 --> 00:11:49,948
Look how simple and clean that is.

166
00:11:49,948 --> 00:11:52,849
And the only concentration of detail is around that logo.

167
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:55,610
Then that makes that logo stand out and read as important.

168
00:11:55,610 --> 00:11:58,312
And that's exactly what's going to happen with everything

169
00:11:58,312 --> 00:11:59,172
we put in our game.

170
00:11:59,693 --> 00:12:02,514
Everything is going to read, everything is going to stand out.

171
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,475
And that's why it's so important that if you place something in there,

172
00:12:06,475 --> 00:12:09,276
it needs to be there for a reason, it needs to have a purpose.

173
00:12:09,276 --> 00:12:16,817
And we also wanted to create a world with attitude.

174
00:12:16,817 --> 00:12:20,998
And what attitude means for us is contrast.

175
00:12:20,998 --> 00:12:25,179
Everything from open to enclosed, from large to small,

176
00:12:25,179 --> 00:12:26,160
warm to cold, etc.

177
00:12:28,027 --> 00:12:32,288
And I sort of wanted to use the attitude to balance back some of the elegance.

178
00:12:32,288 --> 00:12:35,869
Because everything is going to be elegant and white and pristine and exclusive.

179
00:12:35,869 --> 00:12:41,010
But you risk creating something that would feel surreal, artificial, more like a dream world.

180
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:43,350
And then you would break the believable rule.

181
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:44,091
And attitude for us is also angular.

182
00:12:44,091 --> 00:12:48,652
So you're going to see that we use a lot of angular cuts and folds and lines.

183
00:12:48,652 --> 00:12:55,193
In everything from key art to character design, architecture, and even on faith, for instance.

184
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:00,261
And that, for us, is also about being confident.

185
00:13:00,261 --> 00:13:04,502
And understanding that these people, this society, is all

186
00:13:04,502 --> 00:13:06,283
about climbing the corporate ladder.

187
00:13:06,283 --> 00:13:08,123
It's about portraying yourself as somebody

188
00:13:08,123 --> 00:13:09,083
successful and strong.

189
00:13:09,083 --> 00:13:12,404
And that was how we created a certain manner.

190
00:13:12,404 --> 00:13:16,165
So the way you would talk and move would have some sort of

191
00:13:16,165 --> 00:13:17,946
sense of control in it.

192
00:13:17,946 --> 00:13:20,507
But we still had to make sure that it was relaxed and

193
00:13:20,507 --> 00:13:23,167
natural, because we didn't want to have something that

194
00:13:23,167 --> 00:13:25,728
felt clumsy or tense, just over-exaggerated, because

195
00:13:25,728 --> 00:13:27,248
then you would break the elegant rule.

196
00:13:30,254 --> 00:13:33,775
And confidence for you as an artist is being confident in your design.

197
00:13:33,775 --> 00:13:38,816
It's about controlling your shapes, controlling your details,

198
00:13:38,816 --> 00:13:42,857
and dare to be bold and dare to stay minimalistic.

199
00:13:42,857 --> 00:13:48,959
Don't clutter your space just because you feel that it feels a little bit empty.

200
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:50,860
Always remember, less is more.

201
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:55,601
So that would be the what, you know, what we want this universe to feel like

202
00:13:55,601 --> 00:13:57,741
and what we want you to think about when you're designing it.

203
00:13:58,696 --> 00:14:01,398
Then the how, how is this interpreted?

204
00:14:01,398 --> 00:14:05,380
How is this translated into something that we can use and

205
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:07,201
base this universe on?

206
00:14:07,201 --> 00:14:08,782
And that's where the concept of discovery starts.

207
00:14:08,782 --> 00:14:11,944
So now it's about interpreting the style, understanding the

208
00:14:11,944 --> 00:14:16,227
universe, understanding the characters, know how to look

209
00:14:16,227 --> 00:14:19,189
at references, and how to use that to your advantage when

210
00:14:19,189 --> 00:14:21,690
you're creating this universe.

211
00:14:21,690 --> 00:14:23,451
And this was a really long journey for us.

212
00:14:23,451 --> 00:14:25,953
In the beginning, I kept it fairly open.

213
00:14:27,163 --> 00:14:32,551
I think it's important when you're designing something, especially that early, that you really push it too far.

214
00:14:32,551 --> 00:14:36,337
Then when you feel like, okay, now it's too far, that's when you start to dial it back.

215
00:14:36,337 --> 00:14:39,381
Don't do small, intricate steps when you're designing something new.

216
00:14:39,381 --> 00:14:40,843
I think that's really important to remember.

217
00:14:44,035 --> 00:14:52,317
And you can see here now we've explored a lot of architectural details, shapes and forms, softness, diagonal lines, futuristic and so on.

218
00:14:52,317 --> 00:15:00,400
You can see here now we've tried different locations, like in a city, even like how would a wasteland look like in a research world.

219
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:06,962
And this was also an opportunity for me as an art director to see, you know, how would the artist interpreting this style in a tome?

220
00:15:06,962 --> 00:15:11,944
What happens when it becomes elegant, believable and futuristic?

221
00:15:15,085 --> 00:15:19,206
Another thing is important is sometimes to stop and start questioning yourself and question your design

222
00:15:19,206 --> 00:15:21,827
and ask yourself, why does it look like that?

223
00:15:21,827 --> 00:15:28,048
Sometimes we tend to create shapes and forms just for the sake of creating shapes and forms

224
00:15:28,048 --> 00:15:30,409
and then you're in the wrong way

225
00:15:30,409 --> 00:15:35,750
because you start to lose some of the functionality of it and the believability in the space

226
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:42,292
So now we're identifying what you like, and more importantly what you don't like and why

227
00:15:43,034 --> 00:15:45,975
And when you know the why, that's when you can start creating guidelines and rules around that.

228
00:15:45,975 --> 00:15:48,656
That's why concept discovery is so important and necessary for you to go through.

229
00:15:48,656 --> 00:15:50,477
At the same time we're doing this, we explore things in the game as well,

230
00:15:50,477 --> 00:15:51,417
everything from shapes and forms, same things.

231
00:16:01,690 --> 00:16:05,092
So we had tons of these images, lots of interesting spaces,

232
00:16:05,092 --> 00:16:08,554
but I still felt that it wasn't grounded enough.

233
00:16:08,554 --> 00:16:10,155
It felt a little bit too experimental.

234
00:16:10,155 --> 00:16:15,378
It was hard to define what it is we actually are doing.

235
00:16:15,378 --> 00:16:18,080
And that's why I think I learned my second lesson here,

236
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,922
was that by giving it too open to interpretation,

237
00:16:21,922 --> 00:16:25,704
it was really hard to define something concrete,

238
00:16:25,704 --> 00:16:27,165
something that would say,

239
00:16:27,165 --> 00:16:28,466
you know, this is a new research style.

240
00:16:28,967 --> 00:16:34,108
And that's why we sort of had to stop, stop and analyze,

241
00:16:34,108 --> 00:16:36,189
get a better understanding of the translate

242
00:16:36,189 --> 00:16:37,589
and how to interpret the style.

243
00:16:37,589 --> 00:16:38,989
And here's also where I felt that, you know,

244
00:16:38,989 --> 00:16:40,970
I had to narrow it down a bit.

245
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:44,391
I needed to give us something more concrete to base this on.

246
00:16:44,391 --> 00:16:48,992
That's where I took the team to Tokyo.

247
00:16:48,992 --> 00:16:51,193
So Sony needed to give us a chance

248
00:16:51,193 --> 00:16:54,694
to experience something different than something new.

249
00:16:55,225 --> 00:16:59,509
And for you who haven't been in Tokyo, I would really recommend you to go there because it's really interesting space

250
00:16:59,509 --> 00:17:01,850
with architecture and infrastructure.

251
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,992
Even the culture is very different from Europe and the West.

252
00:17:03,992 --> 00:17:05,373
And the reason why I chose Tokyo was because...

253
00:17:11,407 --> 00:17:15,229
If you look at this image here to the left, you can see all the small-scale buildings

254
00:17:15,229 --> 00:17:21,032
and the cluster against the large, massive contemporary structure.

255
00:17:21,032 --> 00:17:26,355
That, for me, is a really nice symbol for how this society functions.

256
00:17:26,355 --> 00:17:31,998
We have the strong, the powerful, the conglomerate towering above the small, the rest of the mass.

257
00:17:31,998 --> 00:17:33,898
So visually, this was like a nice echo of the society.

258
00:17:33,898 --> 00:17:38,861
And you can see as well that Tokyo has a lot of contrast in terms of large and small, but also from old and new.

259
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:42,831
where you can walk along, look at this really nice, fast, commercialized street

260
00:17:42,831 --> 00:17:44,832
and all the building for say, is a structure in there

261
00:17:44,832 --> 00:17:46,532
which is really detailed, nice and polished and clean

262
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,693
but as soon as you step in a little bit

263
00:17:47,693 --> 00:17:48,633
it was really old and dirty and badly maintained

264
00:17:48,633 --> 00:17:49,234
and I really liked that contrast

265
00:17:49,234 --> 00:17:49,834
And talk to yourselves

266
00:17:49,834 --> 00:17:51,495
about organic and asymmetrical architecture

267
00:17:51,495 --> 00:17:51,995
You can see here, you know

268
00:17:51,995 --> 00:17:53,436
it feels very playful, the way they use the shapes and the forms

269
00:17:53,436 --> 00:17:53,816
So I felt that, you know

270
00:18:09,319 --> 00:18:13,382
If we know how to look at this and analyze it and take away all the things that we don't need,

271
00:18:13,382 --> 00:18:19,867
this will give us a really strong foundation in creating something very distinct and unique.

272
00:18:19,867 --> 00:18:25,091
Of course, we took tons of these images from facades, rooftops, people,

273
00:18:25,091 --> 00:18:27,793
anything that will help us visualize this new style.

274
00:18:27,793 --> 00:18:28,654
So now we have all of these references.

275
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:41,265
But what would be the difference now versus before?

276
00:18:41,265 --> 00:18:44,067
Because before, when we did do the concept discovery,

277
00:18:44,067 --> 00:18:45,488
we did use tons of references there as well.

278
00:18:45,488 --> 00:18:48,269
The big difference now was, okay,

279
00:18:48,269 --> 00:18:49,670
now we said, let's narrow it down.

280
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:52,972
Let's, you know, let TOCA be our foundation.

281
00:18:52,972 --> 00:18:54,754
Let's base it on that.

282
00:18:54,754 --> 00:18:56,995
And then we applied the right 30% on top of that.

283
00:18:56,995 --> 00:19:00,157
And also, now I actually wanted to show people

284
00:19:00,157 --> 00:19:02,078
how they could interpret references

285
00:19:02,078 --> 00:19:03,860
and how they can use that to their advantage

286
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:05,661
when they are designing research.

287
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:13,563
It was about making people understand and appreciate the shapes and the form in a space,

288
00:19:13,563 --> 00:19:15,224
especially talk in this case.

289
00:19:15,224 --> 00:19:20,125
And remember that you don't have to redesign and reinvent everything in order to make it

290
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,705
look like a research.

291
00:19:21,705 --> 00:19:27,127
And it was also important to show them that you don't get stuck in the detail, especially

292
00:19:27,127 --> 00:19:28,967
not that early in the process where you were.

293
00:19:33,445 --> 00:19:40,688
But when you can see past the detail and you can see past the noise, just analyze the space itself and look at the big structures and the big forms.

294
00:19:40,688 --> 00:19:50,071
You're going to actually see that, like I said before, take away the dirt and noise and all the unnecessary detail, make it white.

295
00:19:50,071 --> 00:19:51,752
Then you're going to have something that feels very elegant.

296
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:56,813
So you can see that, you know, if we wanted to, we could actually just copy, and talk about one-to-one.

297
00:19:56,813 --> 00:19:58,914
Because for me, that is my research world.

298
00:20:02,032 --> 00:20:08,055
But of course, we had to push it further than this, because we needed to give it a little more edge to it.

299
00:20:08,055 --> 00:20:15,879
But still, it was important to show the people that you don't have to reinvent and redesign everything you do,

300
00:20:15,879 --> 00:20:17,519
because Tokyo has so much things to offer for us already as it is.

301
00:20:17,519 --> 00:20:20,941
Because when you can see past all the data and all the noise,

302
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:25,263
just look at an image for shapes and adapt functions.

303
00:20:25,263 --> 00:20:28,145
You can actually see, you know, that...

304
00:20:29,176 --> 00:20:32,537
What a building really is, is just a containment for the details.

305
00:20:32,537 --> 00:20:36,239
So not the details themselves are going to make the space look interesting.

306
00:20:36,239 --> 00:20:41,801
If you want to have an interesting space, then you need to think about the big picture.

307
00:20:41,801 --> 00:20:43,482
You need to think about composition.

308
00:20:43,482 --> 00:20:50,544
And if those two are not strong enough, then it doesn't matter how much detail you will throw in there.

309
00:20:50,544 --> 00:20:52,785
Because that's still going to make the space look weak.

310
00:20:52,785 --> 00:20:57,847
Because if you think that you can create an interesting space by throwing in a lot of detail,

311
00:20:58,643 --> 00:21:01,724
You're just doing it the way other games are doing it.

312
00:21:01,724 --> 00:21:03,585
Here is the way we should think about this.

313
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:06,606
Take away as much as you can and still make it look interesting.

314
00:21:06,606 --> 00:21:08,247
Because if you look at this image and just analyze it,

315
00:21:08,247 --> 00:21:12,308
you can actually see that this image is actually kind of flat.

316
00:21:12,308 --> 00:21:16,770
You can see the building shapes, the building blueprints,

317
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:18,011
all have the same size.

318
00:21:18,011 --> 00:21:20,892
And the silhouette is actually kind of low.

319
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:23,473
Everything sort of feels the same.

320
00:21:23,473 --> 00:21:25,394
So sure, it has the elegance.

321
00:21:26,352 --> 00:21:27,572
It's believability.

322
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,932
It has an attitude.

323
00:21:28,932 --> 00:21:29,892
It has a contrast.

324
00:21:29,892 --> 00:21:30,852
I remember what I said before about Tokyo.

325
00:21:30,852 --> 00:21:33,113
You had large contemporary structures.

326
00:21:33,113 --> 00:21:35,393
Now you have the smaller structures clustered next to it.

327
00:21:35,393 --> 00:21:39,314
What happens if you would throw some of that in there?

328
00:21:39,314 --> 00:21:40,494
What does that do to your space?

329
00:21:40,494 --> 00:21:44,335
And all you hear now, you can start to see it creates

330
00:21:44,335 --> 00:21:47,296
some drama, some tension between large and small.

331
00:21:47,296 --> 00:21:48,796
And it was also about telling a story with your space.

332
00:21:56,292 --> 00:22:00,835
and not just randomly throw details in there in order to try to make it feel interesting.

333
00:22:00,835 --> 00:22:06,720
Everything needs to have meaning, and everything needs to have a purpose behind it.

334
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,302
For instance, you know, the story here could have been from new to old.

335
00:22:10,302 --> 00:22:15,306
You can see here I kept the modern, cleaner structures closest to the camera.

336
00:22:15,306 --> 00:22:18,328
That could be the only way to maybe commercialize fancy area.

337
00:22:19,597 --> 00:22:22,118
Then I kept the interior image, the small intricate details,

338
00:22:22,118 --> 00:22:25,200
that could sort of be on the way, maybe,

339
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,741
to an older residential space.

340
00:22:26,741 --> 00:22:29,182
So then you would have this journey for the player

341
00:22:29,182 --> 00:22:30,543
to go through modern, clean,

342
00:22:30,543 --> 00:22:33,365
something that's more intricate, dirty, and old,

343
00:22:33,365 --> 00:22:34,545
and to a residential space.

344
00:22:34,545 --> 00:22:37,407
That would be like a nice journey for the player

345
00:22:37,407 --> 00:22:38,488
to experience.

346
00:22:38,488 --> 00:22:41,149
And then you can turn a big structure into,

347
00:22:41,149 --> 00:22:42,790
in the middle to a landmark,

348
00:22:42,790 --> 00:22:45,272
or that would sort of help you with readability

349
00:22:45,272 --> 00:22:45,892
and navigation.

350
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:52,215
So you can see here really that, you know, with very little effort, you can actually

351
00:22:52,215 --> 00:22:55,317
create a very interesting space without having to redesign everything.

352
00:22:55,317 --> 00:22:58,140
It's a matter of understanding, you know.

353
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,802
Take away the noise, take away the detail, add back the right 30 percent,

354
00:23:00,802 --> 00:23:03,465
and you're going to have something that feels very stylish and very interesting.

355
00:23:03,465 --> 00:23:04,806
So we did these concepts just to show the artists.

356
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:18,462
I remember the quote, you know, don't reinvent society in order to portray society.

357
00:23:18,462 --> 00:23:22,923
You don't have to reinvent and redesign everything you do in order to make it feel interesting

358
00:23:22,923 --> 00:23:23,843
and research.

359
00:23:23,843 --> 00:23:25,504
As you can see, our world has so much to offer.

360
00:23:25,504 --> 00:23:29,205
It doesn't matter about your understanding.

361
00:23:29,205 --> 00:23:33,887
Take away the detail, take away the noise, and add back the right 30%.

362
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:36,187
Then you're going to have something that feels very interesting.

363
00:23:36,187 --> 00:23:40,629
For instance, what happens if we change up the roof of material on here?

364
00:23:40,629 --> 00:23:42,910
What does that do to the experience?

365
00:23:45,942 --> 00:23:51,346
Or, you know, how much did I strip away before we start losing the believability in space?

366
00:23:51,346 --> 00:23:54,708
Or, what happens if you throw in some color in there?

367
00:23:54,708 --> 00:23:55,349
What does that do to it?

368
00:23:55,349 --> 00:24:01,473
Or, when you push it really far, maybe create like a fancy rooftop bar, a restaurant up there.

369
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,956
And for me, I read believable.

370
00:24:04,956 --> 00:24:09,219
I see, you know, the big structure, so it's a partner, a related each other.

371
00:24:09,219 --> 00:24:12,502
I can see, you know, the white, the pristine, the elegance.

372
00:24:12,502 --> 00:24:13,983
I can even see some attitude in there.

373
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,381
So that's the style and tone.

374
00:24:22,381 --> 00:24:24,043
Now we have the keywords.

375
00:24:24,043 --> 00:24:27,287
And I've already showed you how you can interpret references

376
00:24:27,287 --> 00:24:28,929
and how you can use them to your advantage

377
00:24:28,929 --> 00:24:30,231
when you are designing something.

378
00:24:30,231 --> 00:24:33,595
Then now then, let's see what happens

379
00:24:33,595 --> 00:24:35,517
when you apply it to new concepts

380
00:24:35,517 --> 00:24:39,221
and then into something that's actually used in the game.

381
00:24:39,221 --> 00:24:40,443
So now we have a better context.

382
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:45,027
And for you to know, our city is called Citoglas.

383
00:24:45,027 --> 00:24:49,131
And we want each and every district in Citoglas to have

384
00:24:49,131 --> 00:24:53,854
its own signature in terms of atmosphere, colors, and life.

385
00:24:53,854 --> 00:24:56,937
And even the audio scape would change depending on where you

386
00:24:56,937 --> 00:24:57,357
were in the district.

387
00:24:57,357 --> 00:24:58,858
So here's what it could look like in downtown, for instance.

388
00:24:58,858 --> 00:25:01,441
And the whole idea with downtown is that downtown is

389
00:25:01,441 --> 00:25:03,963
this hip and cool place.

390
00:25:03,963 --> 00:25:04,463
It's very loud.

391
00:25:04,463 --> 00:25:05,964
It's very busy.

392
00:25:05,964 --> 00:25:10,888
This is what it would be like if you wanted to heartbeat

393
00:25:10,888 --> 00:25:11,689
of Citoglas.

394
00:25:13,942 --> 00:25:17,224
And the architectural language for downtown would be organic.

395
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,947
So we wanted to use a lot of narrow and angular streets.

396
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:24,529
You can see we worked with a lot of intricate details,

397
00:25:24,529 --> 00:25:26,450
the radial shapes just to create some nice silhouettes.

398
00:25:26,450 --> 00:25:29,413
And we also wanted downtown to feel retrofitted.

399
00:25:29,413 --> 00:25:32,135
I remember what I said about Tokyo.

400
00:25:32,135 --> 00:25:34,997
You would have, like, facades facing

401
00:25:34,997 --> 00:25:36,398
important commercial streets.

402
00:25:36,398 --> 00:25:38,339
Look very nice and pristine and very exclusive.

403
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:43,541
But as soon as you get on the rooftops and in the back alleys,

404
00:25:43,541 --> 00:25:46,341
those are going to look less maintained and dirty.

405
00:25:46,341 --> 00:25:50,562
I also want to work with a lot of contrast in downtown.

406
00:25:50,562 --> 00:25:52,523
Same way again, like Tokyo.

407
00:25:52,523 --> 00:25:58,444
Medium and small scale buildings clustered against large, massive contemporary ones.

408
00:25:58,444 --> 00:26:00,525
Anything that sort of creates a nice tension in the space.

409
00:26:00,525 --> 00:26:04,625
And we also want downtown to feel a little bit older.

410
00:26:04,625 --> 00:26:07,086
We also wanted to give it some more history.

411
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:09,247
That's why here you will see more wear and tear.

412
00:26:11,408 --> 00:26:16,833
I hope you can see that because sometimes it's hard to see because of all the whiteness.

413
00:26:18,725 --> 00:26:23,088
I mean, yeah, you can see, you know, we wanted to use a lot of intricate details and noise

414
00:26:23,088 --> 00:26:26,210
just to create an interest in space.

415
00:26:26,210 --> 00:26:31,114
And the reason behind that is because, I remember, everything is to have a reason.

416
00:26:31,114 --> 00:26:36,418
The reason behind that is that, you know, the society doesn't really care about maintaining these rooftops

417
00:26:36,418 --> 00:26:40,381
because the citizens, they're not supposed to be up here anyway.

418
00:26:40,381 --> 00:26:43,484
They should, you know, be out in the food doors, in the factories,

419
00:26:43,484 --> 00:26:46,466
working hard or, you know, down on the streets, spending their money.

420
00:26:46,466 --> 00:26:47,987
That's why they just leave this as it is.

421
00:26:49,617 --> 00:26:53,720
But this is fakesome, and this is what she knows.

422
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:57,682
So you can sort of see that this beautiful picture

423
00:26:57,682 --> 00:27:00,504
this society is trying to paint is just false.

424
00:27:00,504 --> 00:27:01,025
It's literally just a facade.

425
00:27:01,025 --> 00:27:03,727
And of course, you know, the people who live

426
00:27:03,727 --> 00:27:06,529
in higher up here need to sort of reflect this kind of vibe.

427
00:27:06,529 --> 00:27:09,811
So you wanted to keep downtown quite busy

428
00:27:09,811 --> 00:27:12,013
and quite noisy, and touch with details.

429
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,974
You see, we use some exposed machinery,

430
00:27:13,974 --> 00:27:15,575
these cables and stuff.

431
00:27:15,575 --> 00:27:18,517
Then to contrast that, we would have anchors.

432
00:27:21,862 --> 00:27:24,443
And the whole idea with Anchor is that these rooftops,

433
00:27:24,443 --> 00:27:27,005
you almost feel like you are supposed to be on them.

434
00:27:27,005 --> 00:27:29,747
That's what we want, to feel very nice and clean

435
00:27:29,747 --> 00:27:30,228
and reflective.

436
00:27:30,228 --> 00:27:31,168
And the whole idea with Anchor is that here you

437
00:27:31,168 --> 00:27:33,870
would come to do some expensive, exclusive shopping

438
00:27:33,870 --> 00:27:35,191
and go to fancy rooftop bars.

439
00:27:35,191 --> 00:27:38,333
So and only the selected elite are allowed entrance

440
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:38,974
into Anchor.

441
00:27:38,974 --> 00:27:42,696
So if you are in Anchor, then you will need a lot of money.

442
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:46,019
And the architecture language for Anchor would be?

443
00:27:51,385 --> 00:27:56,927
vertical. So we wanted to create, you know, believer spaces very high up, but still one

444
00:27:56,927 --> 00:28:00,328
has a more sense of weight, no towering above it. And it was also about making anchor feel

445
00:28:00,328 --> 00:28:09,431
very exclusive. So we used clean and simple forms, a lot of vertical lines, and you can

446
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:14,713
see a lot of reflective expensive materials. Anything to make anchor feel very expensive

447
00:28:14,713 --> 00:28:19,094
and very pristine. And of course, you know, the people, the lives, and this area needs

448
00:28:19,094 --> 00:28:20,255
to reflect that kind of vibe.

449
00:28:23,673 --> 00:28:32,459
So you can, you know, to anchor to spend money and enjoy yourself and go to clubs.

450
00:28:32,459 --> 00:28:33,499
And to contrast that, we would have the view.

451
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:38,382
And all of the view here is to make it feel very soft and very inviting.

452
00:28:38,382 --> 00:28:44,646
And the view is, I mean, it can be like the final stepping stone before you get elevator,

453
00:28:44,646 --> 00:28:46,587
inviting to Sky City.

454
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:48,849
When in Sky City, that's where, like, the elite lives.

455
00:28:48,849 --> 00:28:53,292
So if you get to the view, then you have succeeded in this universe.

456
00:28:55,908 --> 00:28:59,090
So we wanted the view to feel very calming.

457
00:28:59,090 --> 00:29:01,392
That's why we put it very close to the water.

458
00:29:01,392 --> 00:29:04,213
Then you get a really nice change in the

459
00:29:04,213 --> 00:29:04,814
aural scape as well.

460
00:29:04,814 --> 00:29:07,816
And we also wanted the view to feel cultural.

461
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:13,119
So you can experience art installations, museums,

462
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:13,580
operas, and so on.

463
00:29:13,580 --> 00:29:14,781
And we also wanted the view to feel very soft.

464
00:29:14,781 --> 00:29:19,444
That's why we used the soft interior spaces here.

465
00:29:19,444 --> 00:29:23,346
And here you can also enjoy nature, for instance,

466
00:29:23,346 --> 00:29:24,447
cherry trees.

467
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:33,268
I remember what I said before about minimalism and about control.

468
00:29:33,268 --> 00:29:37,891
For me, the ultimate power of control is when you control nature.

469
00:29:37,891 --> 00:29:39,092
And of course, that's what this society does.

470
00:29:39,092 --> 00:29:41,413
So for instance, if you're in downtown,

471
00:29:41,413 --> 00:29:45,136
you have the low-cost and the mid-cost working and living.

472
00:29:45,136 --> 00:29:47,297
Over there, you're not allowed to enjoy everything.

473
00:29:47,297 --> 00:29:52,000
But here in the view, now you have succeeded in this universe.

474
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,102
Here, you can enjoy everything this city has to offer.

475
00:29:55,302 --> 00:30:02,244
So you get this really nice contrast and tension between the spaces.

476
00:30:02,244 --> 00:30:04,245
You would have like the controlled and sterile downtown

477
00:30:04,245 --> 00:30:05,105
versus the soft and inviting the view.

478
00:30:05,105 --> 00:30:05,965
So we have these different locations.

479
00:30:05,965 --> 00:30:10,627
Each and every one of them has their own signatures in terms of color,

480
00:30:10,627 --> 00:30:12,207
shapes, form, atmosphere, life.

481
00:30:12,207 --> 00:30:20,890
This is where we create like this really broad palette for artists and designers to use

482
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:23,211
and for you as a player to experience.

483
00:30:25,664 --> 00:30:29,645
And of course, there are much more errors than this, but I can just not fit more mood boards in here.

484
00:30:29,645 --> 00:30:33,886
So I guess you have to buy the game and play it if you want to experience some more stuff.

485
00:30:33,886 --> 00:30:41,228
So this is how a rich and vibrant city of glass can look like when you apply the style and tone to it.

486
00:30:41,228 --> 00:30:45,989
So then what happens when you apply the style and tone then on character design?

487
00:30:45,989 --> 00:30:50,410
I think it's important, you know, when you are designing characters.

488
00:30:50,963 --> 00:30:55,005
that needs to reflect who they are and what their purpose is in the universe,

489
00:30:55,005 --> 00:31:00,349
and to know the function behind the design and the reason behind it.

490
00:31:00,349 --> 00:31:04,712
I like to challenge the artist a lot and ask them, like, why is that thing there?

491
00:31:04,712 --> 00:31:09,135
If they cannot give me a good answer, I just tell them to take it away.

492
00:31:09,135 --> 00:31:10,616
The more I remember, the less it's more.

493
00:31:15,826 --> 00:31:21,470
Believer means, on character design, means natural border proportions, strong material definition.

494
00:31:21,470 --> 00:31:26,893
You're going to feel high-tech in advance, but you still want to make sure that it feels,

495
00:31:26,893 --> 00:31:29,555
or you didn't push it so far so it became sci-fi.

496
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,957
And elegance here, it means form before function.

497
00:31:32,957 --> 00:31:39,621
So we are actually un-nudging some of the believability in order to create stylish, interesting designs.

498
00:31:39,621 --> 00:31:42,282
But I mean, I do it for a reason, I do it with a purpose.

499
00:31:43,306 --> 00:31:46,388
and also I'm an art director, so I'm allowed to break my own rules.

500
00:31:46,388 --> 00:31:49,309
And attitude, of course, is posture.

501
00:31:49,309 --> 00:31:55,772
The way these people move, the way these people walk and talk and so on,

502
00:31:55,772 --> 00:31:59,234
it's some sort of sense of attitude and control to it.

503
00:31:59,234 --> 00:32:04,777
And you're going to see that we use a lot of diagonal lines and folds

504
00:32:04,777 --> 00:32:07,799
to give them some more attitude and edginess as well.

505
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,260
And for me also,

506
00:32:11,429 --> 00:32:15,471
attitude is material separation.

507
00:32:15,471 --> 00:32:19,292
For instance, you can have a cotton shirt.

508
00:32:19,292 --> 00:32:23,954
They may put something reflective and leathery on one

509
00:32:23,954 --> 00:32:24,835
of the arms.

510
00:32:24,835 --> 00:32:28,076
And the way those two material meets, for me, that's cocky.

511
00:32:28,076 --> 00:32:28,516
That's attitude.

512
00:32:28,516 --> 00:32:29,657
That's what we use a lot in archaeo-design.

513
00:32:29,657 --> 00:32:31,738
So you can see how it looks like when we apply that to

514
00:32:31,738 --> 00:32:32,598
Krugesek.

515
00:32:32,598 --> 00:32:35,279
And in Krugesek, you've got the bad guys.

516
00:32:35,279 --> 00:32:38,040
You're going to encounter this a lot in this game.

517
00:32:41,039 --> 00:32:46,355
So the high level idea is high fashion meeting, militarized tactical details.

518
00:32:46,355 --> 00:32:48,603
Then we merge that together through the Stalinton.

519
00:32:51,575 --> 00:32:55,536
And you think about, you know, military clothing and police outfits.

520
00:32:55,536 --> 00:32:57,476
Those tend to be a little bit loose.

521
00:32:57,476 --> 00:33:00,577
You get like big and long draping folds.

522
00:33:00,577 --> 00:33:02,638
And for me, that's not elegant.

523
00:33:02,638 --> 00:33:04,698
So we design something.

524
00:33:04,698 --> 00:33:06,959
We look more like a Marni suit.

525
00:33:06,959 --> 00:33:09,980
The fish are very tight and very slim.

526
00:33:09,980 --> 00:33:11,080
Then we apply the tactical details.

527
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,460
And then you get the design that looks like that.

528
00:33:12,460 --> 00:33:18,682
You can see, you know, I've used some diagonal lines on the sleeves and on the legs to give it some attitude.

529
00:33:19,325 --> 00:33:21,126
And you can especially see that on the Hunter drone and the VTOL.

530
00:33:21,126 --> 00:33:22,767
Armour plating has lowered down the lines.

531
00:33:22,767 --> 00:33:24,067
Anything that makes them feel really aggressive.

532
00:33:24,067 --> 00:33:24,948
Now you have the runners.

533
00:33:24,948 --> 00:33:27,069
And the high level of there is high fashion meeting, sports gear.

534
00:33:40,617 --> 00:33:44,819
And the runners, you know, they need to look like people that can take the fight against

535
00:33:44,819 --> 00:33:46,500
this oppressive society and Krugeslag.

536
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,102
That's how we get this really strong, confident, athletic look.

537
00:33:50,102 --> 00:33:54,165
And you can see, you know, we use the same language again.

538
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,426
I've already analyzed the skill and some attitude.

539
00:33:56,426 --> 00:33:59,948
And of course, you know, runners need to feel agile and movable.

540
00:33:59,948 --> 00:34:00,668
That's why you're here.

541
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:02,670
We work more with lighter and thinner materials.

542
00:34:05,292 --> 00:34:09,575
And what you can see here as well is that, you know, we never exaggerate like the body proportions,

543
00:34:09,575 --> 00:34:11,315
especially not the female.

544
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:15,518
And that's something you tend to see in a lot of other games and designs,

545
00:34:15,518 --> 00:34:19,100
that you need to sort of objectify and sexualize the female body.

546
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:21,621
And for me, that's not elegant.

547
00:34:21,621 --> 00:34:22,442
We don't do it here.

548
00:34:22,442 --> 00:34:26,564
You know, I still want it to read as confident and strong and beautiful.

549
00:34:26,564 --> 00:34:29,125
You always need to remember the elegance.

550
00:34:34,495 --> 00:34:35,796
Then we have the Black November.

551
00:34:35,796 --> 00:34:40,480
And the idea here is high fashion, meeting old and worn,

552
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:41,041
thick materials.

553
00:34:41,041 --> 00:34:44,684
Because Black November, they live deep underground in the

554
00:34:44,684 --> 00:34:45,445
tunnels of re-zoning.

555
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:48,767
And down there, it's going to be very cold and very wet.

556
00:34:48,767 --> 00:34:53,812
That's why these people will need more layers of clothes,

557
00:34:53,812 --> 00:34:55,173
thick materials to keep them warm.

558
00:34:55,173 --> 00:34:59,717
And in our world, these people will be considered as bums or

559
00:34:59,717 --> 00:35:00,898
people that live on the street.

560
00:35:01,957 --> 00:35:07,660
So even if they are in a very harsh circumstances, on the border to starvation, and these people

561
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:11,242
are fanatics, I still didn't want to be in the ugliness in this world.

562
00:35:11,242 --> 00:35:15,845
And that's what we gave them, this very cocky, confident look with a lot of attitude.

563
00:35:20,216 --> 00:35:24,320
So we have many different sorts of classes in this world.

564
00:35:24,320 --> 00:35:26,021
And each one of them has its own signature,

565
00:35:26,021 --> 00:35:27,643
into the materials, colors, and so on.

566
00:35:27,643 --> 00:35:31,066
But I don't have time to go through all of that today,

567
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:35,089
because I need to cover the next part.

568
00:35:35,089 --> 00:35:36,631
That is, how we actually created this universe.

569
00:35:36,631 --> 00:35:38,352
So now I'm gonna talk about

570
00:35:38,352 --> 00:35:42,516
our different production phases,

571
00:35:42,516 --> 00:35:43,857
and how then we ended up looking in the game.

572
00:35:47,229 --> 00:35:49,771
So our pipeline was divided into four phases.

573
00:35:49,771 --> 00:35:54,234
Phase one would have been when you reference gathering, put

574
00:35:54,234 --> 00:35:56,556
together mood boards, design simple concepts.

575
00:35:56,556 --> 00:35:59,599
Phase two is when you actually get something you can play on.

576
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:02,741
So now we're laying the foundation for City of Glass.

577
00:36:02,741 --> 00:36:05,944
So now it's about you showing me that you can create a

578
00:36:05,944 --> 00:36:08,206
believable space.

579
00:36:08,206 --> 00:36:09,347
You understand composition.

580
00:36:09,347 --> 00:36:11,628
You understand how to create strong framing.

581
00:36:11,628 --> 00:36:13,790
You know how to scale proportions of building and how

582
00:36:13,790 --> 00:36:14,711
to relate to each other.

583
00:36:15,466 --> 00:36:20,948
And also you have to understand how you can create an interesting space with very simple shapes.

584
00:36:20,948 --> 00:36:26,830
And for me this was the most important part of designing City of Glass.

585
00:36:26,830 --> 00:36:33,132
And if you don't know how to create a strong foundation with very simple shapes and forms,

586
00:36:33,132 --> 00:36:36,413
then it doesn't matter how much detail you are going to throw into that space.

587
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:41,528
And this was a very difficult phase for some people.

588
00:36:41,528 --> 00:36:45,709
So I guess here is the third lesson I learned, that this

589
00:36:45,709 --> 00:36:47,569
phase was a bit abstract.

590
00:36:47,569 --> 00:36:50,750
It was hard for some people to understand the space.

591
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,851
It was hard to visualize what the final product would look

592
00:36:53,851 --> 00:36:57,592
like, so in the end, we ended up throwing in more details

593
00:36:57,592 --> 00:36:59,572
just to help with the scale, proportions, and depth.

594
00:37:04,066 --> 00:37:07,887
Then for phase three, and now is sort of when we're starting to be more creative.

595
00:37:07,887 --> 00:37:11,129
So now we started seeing more architecture detail in the spaces.

596
00:37:11,129 --> 00:37:15,731
And actually at this phase, we had the whole game up and running,

597
00:37:15,731 --> 00:37:18,832
which meant we can play the whole game from the beginning to the end.

598
00:37:18,832 --> 00:37:24,714
And that sort of helped us assess if something needed to change or removed or even deleted

599
00:37:24,714 --> 00:37:26,815
before we moved on to phase four.

600
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:30,176
And phase four is when we apply style.

601
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:33,118
now it is about the details.

602
00:37:33,118 --> 00:37:36,200
And are you doing it in the right time, in the right context?

603
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:43,024
So now is when everything comes in, light, colors, atmosphere.

604
00:37:43,024 --> 00:37:44,966
And phase four of us consider as done.

605
00:37:44,966 --> 00:37:49,589
At this point, your area would be ready for ship, essentially.

606
00:37:49,589 --> 00:37:50,249
And we had roughly around

607
00:37:54,805 --> 00:37:58,987
10 months to take the whole game from phase 3 to phase 4.

608
00:37:58,987 --> 00:38:01,169
So there was a lot of work going in there.

609
00:38:01,169 --> 00:38:02,389
And we had to push really hard there.

610
00:38:02,389 --> 00:38:06,111
And after phase 4, then we actually had some polish and

611
00:38:06,111 --> 00:38:07,833
some bug fixing.

612
00:38:07,833 --> 00:38:10,754
So some areas got some more love and attention to them.

613
00:38:10,754 --> 00:38:15,777
But an area after phase 4 actually did hold up to ship.

614
00:38:15,777 --> 00:38:18,799
So it was really good work there by the team.

615
00:38:21,602 --> 00:38:28,085
So that's the production pipeline that we went through, creating shitter glass.

616
00:38:28,085 --> 00:38:29,085
Let's look at how it looked in the game.

617
00:38:29,085 --> 00:38:32,166
So you can see downtown. It is in phase two.

618
00:38:32,166 --> 00:38:38,388
I think this was probably one of the most successful ones in terms of composition.

619
00:38:39,730 --> 00:38:44,677
You can see there's a really nice tension and contrast between large, medium, small-scale shapes.

620
00:38:44,677 --> 00:38:49,463
Creates a lot of interest around the centerpiece.

621
00:38:49,463 --> 00:38:52,647
And overall, yeah, this is like a really strong foundation.

622
00:38:56,437 --> 00:39:00,162
Then through phase three, when we started applying the details,

623
00:39:00,162 --> 00:39:01,884
now we've started to get an understanding for

624
00:39:01,884 --> 00:39:03,927
how the game looks like,

625
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:06,410
sort of feels like a residential space.

626
00:39:06,410 --> 00:39:06,991
So now, yeah,

627
00:39:06,991 --> 00:39:10,195
the player, or sorry, the people

628
00:39:10,195 --> 00:39:11,597
understand that, you know,

629
00:39:11,597 --> 00:39:13,219
how it's going to turn into later on.

630
00:39:16,348 --> 00:39:18,870
And then for phase four, you know, when we apply this style,

631
00:39:18,870 --> 00:39:20,552
in this case, the style of downtown,

632
00:39:20,552 --> 00:39:23,255
and that one's going to be more busy, more noisy,

633
00:39:23,255 --> 00:39:24,456
have more wear and tear, a lot of atmosphere,

634
00:39:24,456 --> 00:39:25,077
then it'll end up looking like this.

635
00:39:25,077 --> 00:39:26,458
What you can see, though, if you compare that to phase two,

636
00:39:26,458 --> 00:39:27,599
nothing really changed in terms of composition.

637
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:41,815
all the big shapes, all the big structures were in place

638
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:44,198
and they hold up all the way through the production pipeline.

639
00:39:44,198 --> 00:39:46,761
And that's why it's so important for

640
00:39:46,761 --> 00:39:50,847
people to understand, you know, that you need to create a strong foundation

641
00:39:50,847 --> 00:39:54,612
because then you just apply, you know, the details within those shapes.

642
00:40:01,777 --> 00:40:05,639
Here you have an area in anchor at phase three.

643
00:40:05,639 --> 00:40:10,021
Quite rough, but still, you can see the big structures.

644
00:40:10,021 --> 00:40:14,023
Remember, anchor was going to be very pristine, very

645
00:40:14,023 --> 00:40:14,423
exclusive.

646
00:40:14,423 --> 00:40:17,585
The rooftops here should almost feel like you are

647
00:40:17,585 --> 00:40:18,426
supposed to be on them.

648
00:40:18,426 --> 00:40:22,188
And there is an interest there in the center, in the middle.

649
00:40:22,188 --> 00:40:23,008
There's some sort of personalized rooftop.

650
00:40:23,008 --> 00:40:25,049
So the big structures are in place.

651
00:40:25,049 --> 00:40:28,411
Then for phase four, we apply the style.

652
00:40:28,411 --> 00:40:29,412
We end up looking like this.

653
00:40:31,466 --> 00:40:34,748
So now you can see the shine and the reflections and stuff.

654
00:40:34,748 --> 00:40:36,970
We try to hide away some of the unnecessary noise

655
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,611
as much as we can.

656
00:40:37,611 --> 00:40:41,073
You can see how we use the colors as a sort of guide.

657
00:40:41,073 --> 00:40:45,156
The player and the eye in goes towards the residential space.

658
00:40:45,156 --> 00:40:46,757
And in there also, we throw in some nice water

659
00:40:46,757 --> 00:40:49,219
and some nice waterfalls just to make it feel really expensive.

660
00:40:49,219 --> 00:40:50,640
Here we have another area in downtown in phase three.

661
00:41:01,949 --> 00:41:06,214
And actually, not all the spaces were at phase three at the same time.

662
00:41:06,214 --> 00:41:08,037
You can see this one, for instance, is very rough,

663
00:41:08,037 --> 00:41:10,540
only like the big structures are in place.

664
00:41:10,540 --> 00:41:13,845
But at least you can see sort of the lines,

665
00:41:13,845 --> 00:41:17,029
sort of points inwards into the image.

666
00:41:17,029 --> 00:41:18,211
And then for phase four, when we applied the style,

667
00:41:18,211 --> 00:41:19,452
it ended up looking like this.

668
00:41:19,773 --> 00:41:24,214
And this part of downtown was going to be a little more industrial,

669
00:41:24,214 --> 00:41:27,954
so we worked a lot with smaller intricate details to create some nice silhouettes.

670
00:41:27,954 --> 00:41:30,955
And you can see, you know, the way we used the colors, this place got its attitude.

671
00:41:30,955 --> 00:41:32,735
This is another area in Anchor at Phase 3.

672
00:41:32,735 --> 00:41:33,635
And at one point in time...

673
00:41:48,511 --> 00:41:50,133
you know, we did have the time of day up and running,

674
00:41:50,133 --> 00:41:53,236
we actually didn't have time to lit the space.

675
00:41:53,236 --> 00:41:55,839
Or sometimes, you know, the artists will actually break

676
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:57,962
and light and then everything just turn black.

677
00:41:57,962 --> 00:42:00,585
So it was quite hard to read and navigate sometimes,

678
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:02,567
but if you just look at the picture

679
00:42:02,567 --> 00:42:04,349
and just look at the big picture and the structures.

680
00:42:04,950 --> 00:42:07,871
You see you're standing on a plateau, looking down into space.

681
00:42:07,871 --> 00:42:09,251
These are shapes down there.

682
00:42:09,251 --> 00:42:14,774
On the right there you can see some long structures going along a road.

683
00:42:14,774 --> 00:42:18,175
And then for phase four, we apply the style.

684
00:42:18,175 --> 00:42:18,895
It ended up like this.

685
00:42:18,895 --> 00:42:24,357
And again, now you're applying the right details with the right context.

686
00:42:24,357 --> 00:42:25,818
A lot of vertical lines.

687
00:42:25,818 --> 00:42:29,599
We clean up the space, make it feel very nice and reflective on the high end.

688
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:33,881
You can even see how we get some of the rooftop spark up there to the left.

689
00:42:34,373 --> 00:42:37,395
and then you apply the palette of Anchor.

690
00:42:37,395 --> 00:42:38,997
And then I end up looking like this.

691
00:42:38,997 --> 00:42:40,098
Here is another fancy rooftop bar in Anchor.

692
00:42:40,098 --> 00:42:41,299
It doesn't need just reading, or reflective,

693
00:42:41,299 --> 00:42:44,541
and expensive, and luxurious.

694
00:42:44,541 --> 00:42:48,305
You just want to be here with your friends.

695
00:42:48,305 --> 00:42:53,569
Maybe not for phase three, but for phase four,

696
00:42:53,569 --> 00:42:58,793
when we're done with it, we end up looking like this.

697
00:43:00,732 --> 00:43:04,594
I think here is a perfect example of how the artist translated the style and tone.

698
00:43:04,594 --> 00:43:10,196
I can sort of see the soft elegant curves. I can see the diagonal lines.

699
00:43:10,196 --> 00:43:12,918
You have the attitude. You have a nice tension in this place.

700
00:43:12,918 --> 00:43:18,741
At night time, you know, these lights would actually pulsate and make this space feel really vibrant.

701
00:43:18,741 --> 00:43:20,882
So overall, this was a really good interpretation from the artist.

702
00:43:20,882 --> 00:43:22,583
Here you can see another area from the view at phase three.

703
00:43:30,487 --> 00:43:35,928
Remember the view was about making the field very soft and very inviting and over here also you would enjoy nature.

704
00:43:35,928 --> 00:43:41,149
So you can see the big structures are in place, so now we are supplying the stylenton and the details, they end up looking like this.

705
00:43:41,149 --> 00:43:44,550
You have to understand that, you know, there's a lot of thought process going in behind taking something from phase 3 to phase 4.

706
00:43:55,445 --> 00:43:59,627
And maybe you think, you know, how hard is it to create a minimalistic space, you know?

707
00:43:59,627 --> 00:44:01,748
Take away 80% and you have it.

708
00:44:01,748 --> 00:44:04,329
But believe me, it's really not that simple.

709
00:44:04,329 --> 00:44:09,812
And I would argue to say that it's probably more difficult to make a minimalistic space.

710
00:44:09,812 --> 00:44:14,175
Like I said, you know, it's about understanding the shapes and the forms,

711
00:44:14,175 --> 00:44:18,057
taking away the right detail, and then back to the right.

712
00:44:18,057 --> 00:44:23,020
And then also about, you know, this space also needs to be traversable and readable,

713
00:44:23,020 --> 00:44:24,280
and it needs to be fun to run around in.

714
00:44:25,168 --> 00:44:28,049
And in a game, there is so focused on movement.

715
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:31,231
Every square meter is super important.

716
00:44:31,231 --> 00:44:33,032
That's why it's so hard to balance this component

717
00:44:33,032 --> 00:44:34,473
against each other.

718
00:44:34,473 --> 00:44:39,116
So in overall, I'm really happy to see how the people on the

719
00:44:39,116 --> 00:44:42,738
team have translated this style into just being fun and

720
00:44:42,738 --> 00:44:43,078
be creative with it.

721
00:44:43,078 --> 00:44:45,860
So now I'm just going to end the whole presentation by

722
00:44:45,860 --> 00:44:48,661
showing you some more of these locations.

723
00:44:48,661 --> 00:44:50,622
And I actually not going to talk more.

724
00:44:50,622 --> 00:44:52,523
I'm just going to let you enjoy it.

725
00:46:34,002 --> 00:46:37,885
So that's actually all that I had, so I guess that's it.

726
00:46:37,885 --> 00:46:40,766
And I say thank you for coming and enjoy your day.

727
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:41,507
Thank you.

728
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:41,867
Bye-bye.
