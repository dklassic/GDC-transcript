1
00:00:06,780 --> 00:00:07,961
All right then, let's go.

2
00:00:09,702 --> 00:00:11,163
How's everybody doing tonight?

3
00:00:11,783 --> 00:00:12,023
Good?

4
00:00:12,884 --> 00:00:14,204
So real quick, I just want to know,

5
00:00:14,224 --> 00:00:15,545
how many writers do we have in the room?

6
00:00:17,126 --> 00:00:17,566
That's a lot.

7
00:00:18,067 --> 00:00:19,647
How many non-writers do we have in the room?

8
00:00:20,668 --> 00:00:22,829
That's even more, so cool.

9
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:25,971
All right, so today you've heard a lot

10
00:00:26,011 --> 00:00:27,051
about the craft of writing.

11
00:00:27,852 --> 00:00:28,992
And you have a lot of these ideas

12
00:00:29,032 --> 00:00:31,294
you want to start to integrate into your own projects.

13
00:00:31,754 --> 00:00:33,255
Now we're going to talk about how

14
00:00:33,275 --> 00:00:36,436
to work more functionally as a team with multiple departments.

15
00:00:37,537 --> 00:00:39,939
So what do we mean by storytelling is a team sport?

16
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,701
Well, just like many aspects of game development,

17
00:00:43,601 --> 00:00:45,883
the way a team works together can help to determine

18
00:00:45,923 --> 00:00:46,964
how successful they are.

19
00:00:48,005 --> 00:00:50,006
They might be a great group of talented individuals,

20
00:00:50,726 --> 00:00:52,207
but if they don't work well together,

21
00:00:52,528 --> 00:00:54,809
you're going to have problems reaching your full potential.

22
00:00:57,091 --> 00:00:57,351
So...

23
00:01:03,890 --> 00:01:05,971
You want your team to buy into a single vision

24
00:01:06,271 --> 00:01:09,093
and work together towards achieving a single goal

25
00:01:09,693 --> 00:01:10,134
as a team.

26
00:01:10,994 --> 00:01:13,596
You also want them to understand what their roles are going

27
00:01:13,616 --> 00:01:15,717
to be while still feeling empowered enough

28
00:01:15,757 --> 00:01:18,979
to capitalize on opportunities to help elevate the project when

29
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:19,880
they present themselves.

30
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:22,942
So today, we want to give you and your team

31
00:01:24,042 --> 00:01:27,184
some practical solutions to some of the more common problems

32
00:01:27,204 --> 00:01:29,746
that pop up when developing story and narrative

33
00:01:29,786 --> 00:01:30,827
content for your game.

34
00:01:33,279 --> 00:01:34,860
So just kind of a quick introduction here.

35
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,061
My name is Ryan Benno.

36
00:01:36,601 --> 00:01:38,743
I'm an environment artist, which is a little different

37
00:01:39,023 --> 00:01:40,484
than most of the people you've probably heard today.

38
00:01:41,085 --> 00:01:43,327
I've been in the industry for about nine years now.

39
00:01:43,647 --> 00:01:45,188
I'm currently at Insomniac Games,

40
00:01:45,228 --> 00:01:47,570
where I've been working on projects like Sunset Overdrive,

41
00:01:48,411 --> 00:01:49,672
last year's Ratchet & Clank,

42
00:01:50,313 --> 00:01:51,253
and for the last couple years,

43
00:01:51,293 --> 00:01:53,775
I've been working on Hashtag Spider-Man PS4.

44
00:01:55,597 --> 00:01:57,579
I've also worked on the Call of Duty franchise,

45
00:01:57,639 --> 00:01:59,440
as well as Telltale's Walking Dead

46
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,981
and Wolf Among Us projects.

47
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:04,952
So if you can't tell from my body of work,

48
00:02:05,775 --> 00:02:07,702
I have a certain affinity for narrative-driven games.

49
00:02:09,559 --> 00:02:14,122
And I am Raina Anderson. I am a narrative designer over at Eidos Montreal.

50
00:02:14,603 --> 00:02:17,005
I've been in the industry for more than a decade now.

51
00:02:17,145 --> 00:02:19,967
I've worked on titles such as CSI,

52
00:02:20,268 --> 00:02:23,070
Dungeon Hunter and most recently Deus Ex Mankind Divided.

53
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:27,994
Before I got into the industry, I worked in broadcasting and marketing

54
00:02:28,534 --> 00:02:31,497
and I have degrees in both psychology and communication.

55
00:02:32,450 --> 00:02:33,731
And as it turns out, both of those

56
00:02:33,791 --> 00:02:35,633
are super handy when you're making games,

57
00:02:35,834 --> 00:02:38,477
because so much of making games has

58
00:02:38,537 --> 00:02:41,440
to do with understanding people and communicating with them.

59
00:02:44,243 --> 00:02:46,626
So Ryan and I talked about it.

60
00:02:46,806 --> 00:02:50,290
And the problems that we found that we come up with the most

61
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:53,113
are three, the three bullet points.

62
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,041
So first, we see different problems and different solutions

63
00:02:58,381 --> 00:02:59,821
because we all have different lenses.

64
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:01,261
The backgrounds that we've studied

65
00:03:01,301 --> 00:03:04,942
that we bring into the industry color our points of view.

66
00:03:07,363 --> 00:03:10,904
Two, art and writing and design and sound,

67
00:03:10,964 --> 00:03:14,325
we all have different tools and goals and jargon,

68
00:03:14,585 --> 00:03:16,185
and they don't always align.

69
00:03:18,559 --> 00:03:23,143
And three, we are all passionate people who fight for our visions.

70
00:03:24,124 --> 00:03:27,588
And because what we create is art, it feels very personal.

71
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:33,294
So if those are the problems, then our solutions would ultimately be

72
00:03:34,215 --> 00:03:37,599
to be able to communicate story ideas quickly and clearly

73
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:40,722
while maintaining the integrity of the core concepts.

74
00:03:42,498 --> 00:03:44,559
to find ways for departments to connect

75
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,261
instead of clash with each other,

76
00:03:47,222 --> 00:03:49,563
and three, build a team dynamic

77
00:03:49,904 --> 00:03:52,806
where creative people are comfortable being vulnerable.

78
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:54,607
So that's easy, right?

79
00:03:54,747 --> 00:03:56,449
We can just go back and do this.

80
00:03:58,771 --> 00:04:01,793
An ideal environment would allow us to collaborate,

81
00:04:02,173 --> 00:04:04,355
communicate, and check our egos at the door.

82
00:04:05,396 --> 00:04:07,697
However, when our team size is balloon

83
00:04:08,378 --> 00:04:09,359
and the pressure is on,

84
00:04:09,659 --> 00:04:11,781
people don't behave in ideal ways.

85
00:04:13,244 --> 00:04:15,605
So the way that we've structured this talk is to go

86
00:04:15,665 --> 00:04:18,727
over what happens when each of these goals breaks down.

87
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,208
And we'll give you some band-aids that you can apply

88
00:04:21,268 --> 00:04:24,370
immediately, and then some ideas that you can implement

89
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,151
to prevent them from happening in the future.

90
00:04:27,532 --> 00:04:30,734
And most of these ideas apply to team dynamics in general.

91
00:04:30,974 --> 00:04:33,735
However, we want to look at them from our own personal

92
00:04:33,795 --> 00:04:36,116
experiences of working on stories in games.

93
00:04:38,675 --> 00:04:41,437
So the first problem, if you fail to maintain

94
00:04:41,477 --> 00:04:43,419
a cohesive vision, you're gonna end up

95
00:04:43,459 --> 00:04:44,680
with different interpretations.

96
00:04:45,942 --> 00:04:48,804
Everybody can hear the same game plan from the director,

97
00:04:49,085 --> 00:04:51,467
but end up at completely different goal posts.

98
00:04:53,348 --> 00:04:56,832
So the problem is you either have a lack

99
00:04:56,872 --> 00:05:00,075
of a strong vision holder, or one who can't

100
00:05:00,135 --> 00:05:01,636
communicate their vision clearly.

101
00:05:02,217 --> 00:05:04,419
Regardless, there is a breakdown in communication.

102
00:05:06,029 --> 00:05:07,770
So when you have a breakdown in communication,

103
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:09,551
the first thing you should look at is

104
00:05:09,571 --> 00:05:12,672
the degree of difficulty of the language.

105
00:05:13,973 --> 00:05:16,014
English tends to be the operational language

106
00:05:16,054 --> 00:05:16,754
in our industry.

107
00:05:17,515 --> 00:05:19,536
But when you're dealing with sister studios

108
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:21,237
or freelancers or contractors,

109
00:05:21,877 --> 00:05:23,918
it's not necessarily the first language

110
00:05:23,938 --> 00:05:25,038
of everybody involved.

111
00:05:26,899 --> 00:05:29,481
A recent BBC story talked about how Anglophones

112
00:05:29,541 --> 00:05:32,462
who tend to be unilingual are the worst communicators.

113
00:05:34,126 --> 00:05:36,388
Compounding that problem is the fact that non-native

114
00:05:36,468 --> 00:05:39,630
speakers are often scared of losing face.

115
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:43,173
And they pretend to understand even if they don't.

116
00:05:44,234 --> 00:05:46,555
So make sure that you review your documentation for clear

117
00:05:46,615 --> 00:05:50,258
language, reduce the amount of jargon, and use something

118
00:05:50,298 --> 00:05:51,439
like the Hemingway Editor.

119
00:05:51,999 --> 00:05:55,202
For only $20, this app, you can put in any text that you

120
00:05:55,262 --> 00:05:58,905
have, and then it will process it and give you great hints on

121
00:05:59,145 --> 00:06:01,186
ways that you can improve the clarity of your text.

122
00:06:01,286 --> 00:06:03,868
Because you need to make sure that you can communicate.

123
00:06:04,470 --> 00:06:09,293
clearly with your other departments. Another solution is

124
00:06:09,333 --> 00:06:12,315
having gatekeepers in your group. On large teams like the

125
00:06:12,435 --> 00:06:16,658
ones that Raina and I work on, they're pretty crucial to have.

126
00:06:17,378 --> 00:06:20,260
These people are the first line of defense for your story and

127
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,303
narrative content. Gatekeepers are best suited to solve

128
00:06:24,323 --> 00:06:27,024
problems immediately without needing large amounts of energy

129
00:06:27,044 --> 00:06:30,646
and attention from the rest of the team. They understand the

130
00:06:30,687 --> 00:06:32,668
intent of the overall narrative vision.

131
00:06:33,622 --> 00:06:36,622
and can articulate well enough to defend its integrity.

132
00:06:37,603 --> 00:06:39,603
They have strong connections with different departments

133
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:42,044
to help bring that perspective to those

134
00:06:42,084 --> 00:06:44,104
who aren't involved directly in key decision making.

135
00:06:45,384 --> 00:06:48,805
But you also want these to be a select few on your team.

136
00:06:49,225 --> 00:06:50,706
Having too many cooks in the kitchen

137
00:06:51,126 --> 00:06:53,026
can cause splintering of interpretations.

138
00:06:53,907 --> 00:06:55,587
So ultimately, the goal of their role

139
00:06:55,627 --> 00:06:59,288
is to maintain narrative cohesion and continuity

140
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,468
throughout the whole experience of the game.

141
00:07:02,551 --> 00:07:04,412
But more importantly, throughout production,

142
00:07:04,432 --> 00:07:07,394
to make sure content is consistent with the vision.

143
00:07:08,455 --> 00:07:10,416
So speaking of vision, let's talk about the ones

144
00:07:10,516 --> 00:07:11,597
who will be creating it.

145
00:07:12,977 --> 00:07:14,498
You need a vision to go anywhere,

146
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:16,900
and you need a vision holder

147
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,661
who can build it and maintain it.

148
00:07:20,022 --> 00:07:22,263
These are your play callers for storytelling.

149
00:07:23,204 --> 00:07:24,745
They build the foundation early

150
00:07:24,925 --> 00:07:27,386
and set examples for gatekeepers

151
00:07:27,447 --> 00:07:29,348
and the rest of the team to follow.

152
00:07:30,964 --> 00:07:32,346
Usually the director and leads,

153
00:07:32,606 --> 00:07:36,590
this is someone who has thought out the structure

154
00:07:37,130 --> 00:07:40,273
so carefully with a clear picture of its completed state,

155
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,095
they would be able to answer any questions

156
00:07:42,155 --> 00:07:43,997
about what needs to be done at almost any point.

157
00:07:45,138 --> 00:07:47,300
That way if there are any issues that need to be ironed out,

158
00:07:48,601 --> 00:07:50,863
there's already an idea on how to materialize it.

159
00:07:51,987 --> 00:07:56,211
So kind of an example of this working in practice is during a

160
00:07:56,611 --> 00:07:59,974
scene in the walking dead, the protagonist Lee gets stuck

161
00:08:00,014 --> 00:08:02,576
underground inside of a sewer and has to find his way out.

162
00:08:03,917 --> 00:08:06,319
There was a discussion about cutting large parts of this

163
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,282
section, particularly a puzzle where you needed to distract

164
00:08:09,362 --> 00:08:10,563
zombies to clear the way.

165
00:08:11,587 --> 00:08:14,208
This came up because someone on the team working on that scene

166
00:08:14,308 --> 00:08:16,108
didn't think it was an engaging enough puzzle.

167
00:08:16,848 --> 00:08:17,709
So what happened?

168
00:08:18,169 --> 00:08:20,850
The episode's director came in and pitched us

169
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:22,270
on his vision for that scene.

170
00:08:23,351 --> 00:08:25,652
He explained how the sequence was served a significance

171
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:28,273
by breaking up the pacing between large chunks

172
00:08:28,333 --> 00:08:31,434
of dialogue-heavy scenes, and also told us

173
00:08:31,474 --> 00:08:34,115
how we as a team were going to build genuine moments

174
00:08:34,175 --> 00:08:36,175
of tension into that distraction section.

175
00:08:37,636 --> 00:08:39,457
Because he was convincing and got people

176
00:08:39,497 --> 00:08:40,657
to buy into that vision.

177
00:08:41,523 --> 00:08:43,404
The sequence ultimately stayed in the shipped game.

178
00:08:46,187 --> 00:08:48,469
So we've already talked about using clear language.

179
00:08:48,949 --> 00:08:51,431
But we also need to make sure that our document formats are

180
00:08:51,471 --> 00:08:52,052
clear as well.

181
00:08:52,992 --> 00:08:54,934
Documentation is going to be useless if

182
00:08:55,014 --> 00:08:55,935
nobody is using it.

183
00:08:56,936 --> 00:09:00,559
However, documentations are generally used as reference

184
00:09:00,599 --> 00:09:01,099
material.

185
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,662
You can't expect people are going to read it from top to

186
00:09:04,702 --> 00:09:05,022
bottom.

187
00:09:05,957 --> 00:09:07,678
And if you give them a wall of text,

188
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:09,499
they are not going to read it at all.

189
00:09:09,979 --> 00:09:12,021
You need to make sure that you use bullet points

190
00:09:12,241 --> 00:09:14,322
and images and white space.

191
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,684
You have to make sure that your document has an index

192
00:09:17,804 --> 00:09:19,986
and that it's presented in a searchable format

193
00:09:20,446 --> 00:09:22,307
because people are going to use it to scan

194
00:09:22,327 --> 00:09:24,008
for that one piece of information

195
00:09:24,028 --> 00:09:25,189
that they need right then and there.

196
00:09:26,990 --> 00:09:29,512
And shared documentation that's accessible

197
00:09:29,612 --> 00:09:31,873
can prevent arguments from happening in the first place.

198
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,952
For example, on Mankind Divided, our director, J.F. Tsuga,

199
00:09:37,372 --> 00:09:39,413
created the environmental storytelling documents

200
00:09:39,433 --> 00:09:40,074
that we used.

201
00:09:40,334 --> 00:09:42,195
And we referred back to them when

202
00:09:42,295 --> 00:09:44,516
there was a review of one area.

203
00:09:44,596 --> 00:09:47,538
And we felt that there were too many police in a touristy

204
00:09:47,558 --> 00:09:48,778
district during the daytime.

205
00:09:50,801 --> 00:09:54,805
The documentation clearly stated that we needed room to

206
00:09:54,845 --> 00:09:56,046
build to that later in the game.

207
00:09:57,047 --> 00:10:00,031
So the level designers had no problem changing it because it

208
00:10:00,071 --> 00:10:00,952
was clearly stated.

209
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,495
And having clear documentation keeps

210
00:10:03,615 --> 00:10:04,756
everyone on the same page.

211
00:10:07,139 --> 00:10:09,081
Another way to prevent misinterpretation is to make

212
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:11,083
sure that everybody starts on the same page.

213
00:10:12,530 --> 00:10:15,331
All departments need to understand the bigger picture.

214
00:10:15,851 --> 00:10:18,253
You can have meetings to welcome new people

215
00:10:18,293 --> 00:10:20,073
and get them oriented with the project.

216
00:10:20,574 --> 00:10:22,415
And you can also use meetings to kick off

217
00:10:22,455 --> 00:10:23,635
a new feature or phase.

218
00:10:24,256 --> 00:10:28,298
And this gives you a chance to review narrative documentation,

219
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:32,340
art direction, sound, design.

220
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,321
And you can see how everybody is going

221
00:10:34,361 --> 00:10:36,322
to fit into the final picture.

222
00:10:39,928 --> 00:10:42,450
Because in a team sport, you might be executing

223
00:10:42,490 --> 00:10:45,112
your own personal move, however,

224
00:10:45,172 --> 00:10:47,933
you need to know how everybody else is functioning.

225
00:10:48,594 --> 00:10:50,395
And you need to know that everybody's working

226
00:10:50,435 --> 00:10:51,376
towards the same goal.

227
00:10:52,056 --> 00:10:54,157
And personally, I get so much out of our

228
00:10:54,197 --> 00:10:55,938
multidisciplinary meetings that we have,

229
00:10:56,119 --> 00:10:57,820
especially when the directors are involved.

230
00:10:58,300 --> 00:11:00,601
Because it's a lot harder to question the angle

231
00:11:00,621 --> 00:11:02,122
a department is taking on something

232
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:04,063
when you know that all of the directors

233
00:11:04,504 --> 00:11:05,744
are focused on the same goal.

234
00:11:08,119 --> 00:11:09,560
So after you've had your kickoff meeting,

235
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:11,241
and everyone's been well-informed,

236
00:11:11,441 --> 00:11:13,101
it's time to put that direction to the test.

237
00:11:13,962 --> 00:11:17,924
Applying all your key storytelling principles

238
00:11:17,964 --> 00:11:20,865
into content creation is one of the biggest challenges

239
00:11:20,905 --> 00:11:22,025
you'll face in development.

240
00:11:23,126 --> 00:11:24,467
How do you coordinate all these people

241
00:11:24,507 --> 00:11:27,088
with different disciplines to contribute in meaningful ways

242
00:11:27,308 --> 00:11:29,109
and help your story or narrative content?

243
00:11:31,050 --> 00:11:34,411
So it's important to realize that every discipline

244
00:11:34,511 --> 00:11:36,692
on your team has a capacity to tell stories.

245
00:11:38,609 --> 00:11:40,050
For me, as an environment artist,

246
00:11:40,210 --> 00:11:42,412
I look at how to tell stories differently

247
00:11:42,492 --> 00:11:44,053
from how a sound designer might,

248
00:11:44,413 --> 00:11:46,595
or a cinematic artist, or an animator.

249
00:11:46,875 --> 00:11:47,355
Or a writer.

250
00:11:47,816 --> 00:11:48,356
Or a writer.

251
00:11:50,778 --> 00:11:52,659
I see it in terms of how can I tell stories

252
00:11:52,739 --> 00:11:55,921
visually through the spaces that our characters,

253
00:11:56,062 --> 00:11:57,923
their history, and culture occupy?

254
00:11:58,904 --> 00:12:00,565
Because no environments would exist

255
00:12:00,605 --> 00:12:02,086
without their influence on the world.

256
00:12:03,247 --> 00:12:04,608
I'm constantly asking myself,

257
00:12:04,908 --> 00:12:07,230
is what I'm making going to help achieve

258
00:12:07,270 --> 00:12:08,030
the narrative goals?

259
00:12:09,331 --> 00:12:11,273
So what are some solutions to consider?

260
00:12:13,115 --> 00:12:14,796
Well, I can start with what I was just talking about,

261
00:12:14,816 --> 00:12:16,238
which is asking questions.

262
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,241
After you get assigned a task,

263
00:12:19,341 --> 00:12:21,443
it's pretty common for artists to gather reference

264
00:12:21,523 --> 00:12:23,345
and do any sort of necessary research.

265
00:12:24,626 --> 00:12:25,827
But this is also the time to ask

266
00:12:25,847 --> 00:12:28,470
if there's any specific narrative relevancy to it.

267
00:12:29,567 --> 00:12:31,489
Be proactive and ask questions like,

268
00:12:32,149 --> 00:12:32,950
who is this character?

269
00:12:33,410 --> 00:12:35,051
What type of space do they occupy?

270
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:36,372
What happened here?

271
00:12:37,093 --> 00:12:38,213
How did the space come to be?

272
00:12:38,714 --> 00:12:40,235
And what tone is trying to be conveyed?

273
00:12:41,596 --> 00:12:44,438
For any artist, asking questions about story and characters

274
00:12:44,498 --> 00:12:45,599
is incredibly important,

275
00:12:46,219 --> 00:12:48,601
and we don't usually do enough of it,

276
00:12:48,801 --> 00:12:50,002
to be perfectly honest.

277
00:12:50,642 --> 00:12:52,544
It gives you more ideas and tools to play with

278
00:12:52,644 --> 00:12:54,585
when building spaces and creating props.

279
00:12:56,001 --> 00:12:58,222
Try not to settle for making, quote unquote,

280
00:12:58,342 --> 00:13:00,302
just a prop or just a room.

281
00:13:00,902 --> 00:13:03,723
Seek out stories that those assets can tell.

282
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:07,264
Even though I'm just speaking for the art department here,

283
00:13:07,284 --> 00:13:09,425
a lot of these approaches to asking questions

284
00:13:09,445 --> 00:13:11,966
can be expanded to other disciplines as well.

285
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:16,687
Be alert to opportunities to expand on narrative

286
00:13:18,047 --> 00:13:19,768
or character elements, even in small ways.

287
00:13:23,055 --> 00:13:24,715
So an example of this working was

288
00:13:24,815 --> 00:13:26,736
when we started to remake the environment art

289
00:13:26,796 --> 00:13:29,658
from the original Ratchet and Clank for the PS4 version,

290
00:13:30,478 --> 00:13:32,619
one of the important things for us was to figure out

291
00:13:32,859 --> 00:13:35,620
what these spaces were originally meant to be

292
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,541
when they were conceived on the PS2.

293
00:13:38,842 --> 00:13:40,802
We went back to original concept art,

294
00:13:41,043 --> 00:13:42,563
and when available, we interviewed people

295
00:13:42,603 --> 00:13:43,944
who had worked on the original game

296
00:13:44,044 --> 00:13:45,625
and worked on specific levels.

297
00:13:47,043 --> 00:13:49,564
And what we learned was that many spaces weren't fully

298
00:13:49,624 --> 00:13:52,985
realized, so we pushed for additional assets to help

299
00:13:53,045 --> 00:13:54,185
convey those ideas.

300
00:13:55,925 --> 00:14:01,226
Asking questions and being inquisitive is really all about

301
00:14:01,386 --> 00:14:03,287
one thing, though, and that's getting to the

302
00:14:03,347 --> 00:14:06,987
core of your concept.

303
00:14:09,188 --> 00:14:11,668
This needs to be the backbone of your whole narrative.

304
00:14:12,769 --> 00:14:16,391
It's a central theme, idea, emotion, whatever you want to

305
00:14:16,431 --> 00:14:21,535
call it that you are trying to explicitly convey. You'll need

306
00:14:21,555 --> 00:14:24,137
this to answer questions like what message are we trying to

307
00:14:24,157 --> 00:14:30,622
get across or what emotion do we want them to feel. This can also

308
00:14:30,682 --> 00:14:33,465
be really helpful when you end up getting stuck looking at

309
00:14:33,525 --> 00:14:36,607
smaller details in your story or plot that ultimately may not

310
00:14:36,647 --> 00:14:37,408
matter all that much.

311
00:14:38,533 --> 00:14:40,794
But if you always keep in mind the core theme

312
00:14:40,874 --> 00:14:42,515
and try to stay true to that,

313
00:14:43,375 --> 00:14:45,075
you'll have a better chance of finding the answer

314
00:14:45,115 --> 00:14:45,855
that you're looking for.

315
00:14:45,875 --> 00:14:49,416
It will help you to set boundaries and expectations

316
00:14:49,517 --> 00:14:51,977
of what kind of context and content you'll want.

317
00:14:53,998 --> 00:14:56,258
So in a game like Sunset Overdrive,

318
00:14:56,278 --> 00:14:59,239
that is this very colorful and bright and sarcastic place,

319
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,360
we also wanted to visually convey

320
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,460
smaller and grounded moments to emphasize

321
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:05,281
that an urban apocalypse had just happened.

322
00:15:06,788 --> 00:15:09,189
So when we did our set dressing pass,

323
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:10,950
we specifically called out the need

324
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:12,631
to create areas that emphasize that,

325
00:15:13,631 --> 00:15:14,952
like boarding up storefronts

326
00:15:15,052 --> 00:15:17,493
and placing burnt out vehicles or wrecked buildings.

327
00:15:18,573 --> 00:15:20,014
We asked ourselves questions like,

328
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:22,395
what would a picnic look like in the middle of the outbreak?

329
00:15:22,755 --> 00:15:23,936
And then we'd go off and build that.

330
00:15:25,536 --> 00:15:27,517
In creating interesting set dressing,

331
00:15:27,597 --> 00:15:29,738
we hope that some players might stop for a moment,

332
00:15:29,958 --> 00:15:32,619
take in the scenery, and be curious about events

333
00:15:32,659 --> 00:15:33,880
that might have happened in that spot.

334
00:15:37,010 --> 00:15:40,413
But how do you get to the core if you only know your piece of the puzzle?

335
00:15:41,013 --> 00:15:44,295
You need to be able to understand how all of those pieces are going to fit together.

336
00:15:45,255 --> 00:15:48,938
And so we've talked about how all of these different departments have different languages.

337
00:15:50,278 --> 00:15:52,800
One thing that you can do is learn the basics of another language.

338
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:59,324
You can read a book, watch a video, or even just go through and read the documentation from another department.

339
00:16:01,184 --> 00:16:02,825
can take it on yourself to learn something.

340
00:16:02,845 --> 00:16:05,267
There are so many courses available online

341
00:16:05,287 --> 00:16:07,448
from all different kinds of prestigious universities,

342
00:16:07,949 --> 00:16:08,569
and they're free.

343
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:12,352
You can learn the meaning of terms like cross-cutting

344
00:16:12,632 --> 00:16:14,833
and environment mapping and UX chunking

345
00:16:15,214 --> 00:16:17,375
that might be frequently heard within a discipline,

346
00:16:17,775 --> 00:16:19,957
but we might not hear it that frequently outside.

347
00:16:21,158 --> 00:16:22,679
Also, if we are the experts,

348
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:25,361
we can teach the others on our team.

349
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:26,721
We can share our information.

350
00:16:28,227 --> 00:16:31,889
At Eidos Montreal we have this program called Square U.

351
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:35,571
It gives the opportunity for us to make presentations

352
00:16:35,611 --> 00:16:36,332
within the company.

353
00:16:36,792 --> 00:16:39,253
We can do it live in the theater

354
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,495
and then rebroadcast it throughout the studio

355
00:16:41,895 --> 00:16:44,036
to everybody's desktops and then make it available

356
00:16:44,597 --> 00:16:45,677
in an online archive.

357
00:16:45,797 --> 00:16:48,579
It also gives us a chance to practice our GDC presentations.

358
00:16:50,489 --> 00:16:55,193
One presentation that had really stuck with me is when our animation director, David Hubert,

359
00:16:55,754 --> 00:17:02,880
talked about his time at DreamWorks, and how he animated a scene between two characters

360
00:17:03,601 --> 00:17:07,304
according to not the dialogue that they were saying, but on the subtext that was going

361
00:17:07,364 --> 00:17:08,565
on between those two characters.

362
00:17:09,226 --> 00:17:14,430
And for a writer to hear another department talk about subtext, that was pretty awesome.

363
00:17:15,595 --> 00:17:18,617
And it makes it a lot easier to trust the expertise of your

364
00:17:18,657 --> 00:17:21,179
co-workers when you can understand the approach that

365
00:17:21,219 --> 00:17:22,440
they're taking with their work.

366
00:17:25,542 --> 00:17:29,164
Also, we need to be able to get our hands dirty.

367
00:17:30,485 --> 00:17:34,308
On small teams, everybody is doing whatever it takes to get

368
00:17:34,368 --> 00:17:35,128
the job done.

369
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:37,790
Everybody knows how to use your engine.

370
00:17:39,187 --> 00:17:41,808
On large teams, you end up in very specialized roles.

371
00:17:42,428 --> 00:17:44,169
And you may only understand how to do

372
00:17:44,269 --> 00:17:45,750
your little piece of the work.

373
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:48,451
And you don't understand how everybody else on the team

374
00:17:48,531 --> 00:17:49,932
is using the engine to do theirs.

375
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:54,374
So everybody and absolutely everybody

376
00:17:54,434 --> 00:17:57,636
needs to get a crash course in how to use your engine.

377
00:18:00,075 --> 00:18:01,295
It gives you a better idea,

378
00:18:01,315 --> 00:18:03,075
not just the engine in general,

379
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:04,596
but how all of the other departments

380
00:18:04,656 --> 00:18:06,376
are using the engine for their jobs.

381
00:18:07,256 --> 00:18:08,456
When a problem comes up,

382
00:18:08,736 --> 00:18:11,197
you're going to be able to propose better solutions

383
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,417
because you're going to have an understanding

384
00:18:13,617 --> 00:18:15,358
of what's easy to implement,

385
00:18:16,158 --> 00:18:17,678
how far the engine can be pushed,

386
00:18:17,898 --> 00:18:20,059
and what kind of solution is just going to

387
00:18:20,259 --> 00:18:22,979
eat away at the team's time and become more of a problem.

388
00:18:25,760 --> 00:18:27,480
So now that we know how to create together,

389
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:30,734
How do you give and receive feedback without destroying

390
00:18:30,754 --> 00:18:32,574
a lot of the good lines of communication

391
00:18:32,935 --> 00:18:34,075
that have been built up as a team?

392
00:18:35,335 --> 00:18:37,976
How do you handle ideas that individually might excite you

393
00:18:38,257 --> 00:18:40,177
but may not be the best fit for the overall vision?

394
00:18:41,238 --> 00:18:43,338
These are the type of problems that will come up constantly,

395
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,719
mainly because we're all very passionate people,

396
00:18:45,759 --> 00:18:46,920
as I'm sure everyone in this room is,

397
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,061
and we get excited about ideas, especially our own.

398
00:18:51,982 --> 00:18:54,343
But presenting those ideas and not getting any feedback

399
00:18:54,403 --> 00:18:56,923
or outright rejection can discourage others

400
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,264
from introducing new ideas

401
00:18:58,324 --> 00:18:59,684
when they might be sorely needed.

402
00:19:00,945 --> 00:19:03,885
This is a simple and easy way to destroy creative morale

403
00:19:03,925 --> 00:19:05,926
by having people on your team feel like their voices

404
00:19:06,006 --> 00:19:06,646
aren't being heard.

405
00:19:07,866 --> 00:19:10,107
How do you convey to your team the best ways

406
00:19:10,167 --> 00:19:12,427
to introduce ideas that are in sync with the vision,

407
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,368
but also how can you give constructive feedback

408
00:19:15,408 --> 00:19:15,948
to those ideas?

409
00:19:17,772 --> 00:19:21,094
Probably the most constructive way is presenting problems and

410
00:19:21,134 --> 00:19:24,335
weaknesses in the story to your team and asking them, hey,

411
00:19:25,076 --> 00:19:26,637
let's try to solve this together.

412
00:19:28,318 --> 00:19:30,739
Soliciting answers from team members is a great way to

413
00:19:30,779 --> 00:19:33,521
convey you are trying to encourage collaboration.

414
00:19:34,461 --> 00:19:36,342
People want to feel like they are part of a team and a

415
00:19:36,402 --> 00:19:37,223
creative process.

416
00:19:37,923 --> 00:19:39,864
And there will be points where you're probably going to need a

417
00:19:40,165 --> 00:19:42,206
different viewpoint to solve a problem.

418
00:19:44,447 --> 00:19:46,547
Even when you don't think you need immediate solutions,

419
00:19:47,008 --> 00:19:48,628
don't actively discourage people

420
00:19:48,808 --> 00:19:50,369
from sending you suggestions.

421
00:19:51,750 --> 00:19:53,690
People on your team want to feel passionate

422
00:19:53,810 --> 00:19:55,251
about the story you're trying to tell,

423
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:57,592
and getting them excited will motivate them

424
00:19:57,672 --> 00:20:00,693
to want to contribute in any way they can,

425
00:20:00,713 --> 00:20:01,854
whether that's through their work

426
00:20:01,934 --> 00:20:03,154
or through sharing of ideas.

427
00:20:06,416 --> 00:20:08,076
Ultimately, you want to create a culture

428
00:20:08,096 --> 00:20:09,737
of openly discussing the story,

429
00:20:10,077 --> 00:20:11,458
its strengths and its weaknesses.

430
00:20:12,709 --> 00:20:15,991
People on your team who want to feel passionate about the story of your game

431
00:20:16,071 --> 00:20:20,673
and getting them excited will also help overall morale on the project.

432
00:20:22,494 --> 00:20:27,257
Kind of an example of this working was near the end of development for The Walking Dead Season 1,

433
00:20:27,557 --> 00:20:30,378
our lead writer Sean Vandeman sent out a company-wide email

434
00:20:31,279 --> 00:20:33,160
asking people to read through the script

435
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:38,503
and if they saw any way to punch up things like subtext or metaphor in the last episode

436
00:20:38,643 --> 00:20:40,384
to speak up and present them to the team.

437
00:20:41,528 --> 00:20:43,149
He specifically shared an idea brought up

438
00:20:43,189 --> 00:20:45,349
by one cinematic artist as the type of example

439
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:46,930
that he was looking for.

440
00:20:49,090 --> 00:20:50,811
If you're in a decision-making position,

441
00:20:51,811 --> 00:20:53,232
you need to give articulate reasons

442
00:20:53,272 --> 00:20:54,492
why some suggestions work,

443
00:20:54,932 --> 00:20:56,252
or more importantly, don't work.

444
00:20:57,573 --> 00:20:59,533
When giving feedback, we know that not every idea

445
00:20:59,573 --> 00:21:02,074
is gonna be usable, but making it clear

446
00:21:02,234 --> 00:21:04,495
why those ideas don't work is also important to do.

447
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,742
Try to turn the rejection into a way to strengthen

448
00:21:07,782 --> 00:21:10,784
communication, but also highlight the ideas that do

449
00:21:10,844 --> 00:21:13,526
not get, or that do get accepted, excuse me, and the

450
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:14,908
reason why those ideas work.

451
00:21:16,329 --> 00:21:18,831
Help guide your team in the direction of types of ideas

452
00:21:18,871 --> 00:21:21,173
that work by being sincere and direct with them.

453
00:21:22,154 --> 00:21:25,216
Coming off as being dismissive can send the wrong message and

454
00:21:25,257 --> 00:21:27,799
create a culture where people don't feel their suggestions

455
00:21:27,839 --> 00:21:29,480
will be taken into consideration.

456
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:33,531
Something a few of our designers and insomniacs

457
00:21:33,551 --> 00:21:35,553
started to do pretty recently

458
00:21:35,753 --> 00:21:37,774
was when they would give a suggestion

459
00:21:38,175 --> 00:21:40,557
and send out an email with their idea to the whole team.

460
00:21:41,397 --> 00:21:43,699
They would usually reference and link directly

461
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:45,561
to a section of the existing script

462
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:46,942
that was relevant to the point

463
00:21:46,962 --> 00:21:47,722
that they were trying to make.

464
00:21:48,503 --> 00:21:51,045
This helps to immediately give proper context

465
00:21:51,065 --> 00:21:53,167
to their suggestions for the people

466
00:21:53,207 --> 00:21:54,388
that they are trying to convince.

467
00:21:56,794 --> 00:21:59,797
However, none of those band-aids are going to stick

468
00:21:59,978 --> 00:22:01,539
if you've already got your hackles up

469
00:22:01,660 --> 00:22:03,802
before you even start getting the feedback.

470
00:22:05,204 --> 00:22:06,885
In psychology, there's this concept

471
00:22:06,905 --> 00:22:08,127
called the negativity bias.

472
00:22:08,487 --> 00:22:12,552
It means that we feel bad feelings

473
00:22:13,152 --> 00:22:15,315
more quickly, more intensely,

474
00:22:15,635 --> 00:22:17,838
and for longer than any good ones.

475
00:22:19,502 --> 00:22:22,122
And this is a problem if we only have bad interactions

476
00:22:22,162 --> 00:22:24,983
with our team members, because we begin to end up

477
00:22:25,343 --> 00:22:27,103
dreading interacting with those people.

478
00:22:28,964 --> 00:22:32,804
And this is a huge blocker when these team members

479
00:22:32,844 --> 00:22:34,725
are the ones who must necessarily critique

480
00:22:34,765 --> 00:22:35,685
the work that you're doing.

481
00:22:38,465 --> 00:22:40,806
Scientists have found that it takes between

482
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:43,827
three and six positive interactions

483
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,407
just to balance out one negative interaction.

484
00:22:48,007 --> 00:22:51,308
So it takes frequent, small positive interactions

485
00:22:51,368 --> 00:22:54,389
like grabbing coffee together, saying hello,

486
00:22:54,409 --> 00:22:58,470
and being close with your coworkers

487
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:00,810
is going to improve the efficiency of your team.

488
00:23:02,851 --> 00:23:05,372
Claire Neuer, who is the founder of Learning is Leadership,

489
00:23:05,472 --> 00:23:06,972
worked with oil rig workers,

490
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:10,453
and oil rig workers are known for having a culture

491
00:23:10,473 --> 00:23:12,534
that keeps them from expressing themselves,

492
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:16,235
and she trained them to be a lot more emotionally responsive.

493
00:23:17,302 --> 00:23:19,582
And the oil companies found that this led to a huge

494
00:23:19,862 --> 00:23:22,763
decrease in accidents and a huge improvement in efficiency.

495
00:23:24,024 --> 00:23:26,144
So when we start being friends with our coworkers

496
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,405
and being vulnerable and open with them,

497
00:23:29,145 --> 00:23:31,226
and we're building this kind of community within our team,

498
00:23:31,326 --> 00:23:33,387
we can get past that negativity bias

499
00:23:33,887 --> 00:23:36,888
and work on being more open with our communication.

500
00:23:38,008 --> 00:23:40,789
On Mankind Divided, the SideQuest team

501
00:23:40,829 --> 00:23:42,209
worked really closely together.

502
00:23:42,309 --> 00:23:44,390
Instead of working within their own departments,

503
00:23:44,490 --> 00:23:46,311
they functioned more as a strike team.

504
00:23:47,418 --> 00:23:51,279
And in my opinion, the quality of the work that they produced

505
00:23:53,020 --> 00:23:55,401
is correlated with the closeness of the team members.

506
00:23:58,202 --> 00:23:59,623
So just to kind of recap everything

507
00:23:59,663 --> 00:24:01,703
that we've talked about today, it

508
00:24:01,723 --> 00:24:03,184
can be a two-way street when working

509
00:24:03,224 --> 00:24:04,184
with narrative in a game.

510
00:24:04,664 --> 00:24:06,905
Making sure the team is well-informed enough

511
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,806
to feel like they can be creative within the vision,

512
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:12,387
but also giving them one that's exciting enough for them

513
00:24:12,427 --> 00:24:13,928
to seek out ways to make it better

514
00:24:13,968 --> 00:24:15,048
within their own skill sets.

515
00:24:16,505 --> 00:24:19,049
Ultimately, it's important to get everyone on the same page.

516
00:24:19,569 --> 00:24:22,173
Regardless of the team size, maintaining communication

517
00:24:22,353 --> 00:24:24,176
and staying true to the core themes

518
00:24:24,316 --> 00:24:26,158
of what you're trying to get at are important.

519
00:24:27,822 --> 00:24:30,864
And we take our work and the critiques on our work seriously.

520
00:24:32,005 --> 00:24:34,486
It can be difficult to separate the personal

521
00:24:34,526 --> 00:24:36,948
from the professional, and we need to keep in mind

522
00:24:37,108 --> 00:24:39,329
that we're all working toward the same goal.

523
00:24:40,350 --> 00:24:42,351
And as such, we need to trust the expertise

524
00:24:42,391 --> 00:24:43,231
of our team members.

525
00:24:43,792 --> 00:24:45,333
By learning more about each other

526
00:24:45,773 --> 00:24:47,214
and about each other's professions,

527
00:24:47,674 --> 00:24:50,295
we can create a team that is much more in sync,

528
00:24:50,496 --> 00:24:52,377
which is going to improve whatever project

529
00:24:52,417 --> 00:24:53,217
we work on together.

530
00:24:55,936 --> 00:24:59,617
And you'll notice that a common thread throughout all of our solutions is empathy.

531
00:25:00,417 --> 00:25:03,898
You have to have the mindset of seeing the problem through someone else's lens.

532
00:25:04,499 --> 00:25:08,060
You have to build this into both your pipelines and your team structures.

533
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:12,861
If you give your team the tools that they need to see all sides of the story, you're

534
00:25:12,881 --> 00:25:14,822
going to end up with a stronger story overall.

535
00:25:17,803 --> 00:25:19,743
These are some of the links of things that we've mentioned throughout.

536
00:25:19,863 --> 00:25:21,984
These will be available in the slides online after.

537
00:25:24,329 --> 00:25:26,870
So thank you very much. Make sure to fill out your surveys.

538
00:25:27,730 --> 00:25:29,570
And we'll be available in the wrap-up room.

539
00:25:29,630 --> 00:25:38,713
APPLAUSE

540
00:25:38,753 --> 00:25:40,953
Well done, well done.

541
00:25:42,774 --> 00:25:46,395
Yes, so evaluations, don't forget those. Wrap-up room, all very important.

542
00:25:46,795 --> 00:25:48,635
Mythical Place writers hang out tonight. Be there.

543
00:25:50,836 --> 00:25:52,356
If you don't know what I'm talking about, ask around.

544
00:25:54,449 --> 00:26:04,400
Just a quick moment to wrap this entire event up. Back a long

545
00:26:04,440 --> 00:26:06,322
time ago when I used to be an actor and a theater director,

546
00:26:07,163 --> 00:26:12,069
sometimes somebody would say to me that they would refer to

547
00:26:12,429 --> 00:26:14,531
acting as being the art of lying well.

548
00:26:16,845 --> 00:26:20,406
And anybody who's really, who really has any training in theater knows

549
00:26:21,246 --> 00:26:25,527
that that's actually not at all the case. That acting is the art of telling the truth.

550
00:26:27,447 --> 00:26:30,028
And believing in the truth that you're telling at the moment that you're doing it.

551
00:26:33,629 --> 00:26:39,450
And I think about that a lot, and I think about empathy as these guys were just talking about.

552
00:26:42,090 --> 00:26:42,770
And I think about

553
00:26:43,956 --> 00:26:48,057
the fact that those are two things I will offer as my

554
00:26:48,097 --> 00:26:50,658
opinion only that are in short supply in the world at the

555
00:26:50,698 --> 00:26:57,180
moment. And there's not a ton that we as artists can do about

556
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:04,303
that necessarily. But as narrative artists, as narrative

557
00:27:04,323 --> 00:27:08,844
professionals in this medium, as I've said before,

558
00:27:10,939 --> 00:27:15,761
I think our job is to provide context and to provide meaning.

559
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,942
It is to tell truth.

560
00:27:19,402 --> 00:27:23,584
It is to show and promote empathy.

561
00:27:25,704 --> 00:27:34,288
And I think it's an important moment for us to think about the power that we do have in

562
00:27:34,308 --> 00:27:35,268
the choices that we make.

563
00:27:39,947 --> 00:27:43,970
It's a responsibility. It's also a kind of a pleasure to have

564
00:27:44,010 --> 00:27:48,053
that. And to be able to affect people's lives, to have an

565
00:27:48,374 --> 00:27:54,178
emotional impact on people, to help to forge an emotional bond

566
00:27:54,238 --> 00:27:58,461
between the player and a game experience. And maybe even

567
00:27:58,501 --> 00:28:03,105
something even more meaningful than that. It's not being too

568
00:28:03,125 --> 00:28:07,048
pretentious, I think, to suggest that that's possible. So...

569
00:28:09,664 --> 00:28:12,005
I've really enjoyed getting to meet some of you that I didn't

570
00:28:12,045 --> 00:28:15,466
know. I hope you've enjoyed being here. I do hope you will

571
00:28:15,486 --> 00:28:19,888
come out to the mythical place tonight. Make new friends. Build

572
00:28:19,948 --> 00:28:25,370
relationships. Share empathy. Tell truth. Get better at

573
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:30,872
providing meaning and context because there is no moment that

574
00:28:30,912 --> 00:28:32,213
needs it more from us than now.

575
00:28:34,257 --> 00:28:37,679
On behalf of Lev Chepelsky and Richard Dansky and Mary DeMarle

576
00:28:37,739 --> 00:28:39,841
and Susan O'Connor, the rest of the board advisors

577
00:28:39,881 --> 00:28:42,622
for this summit, we are very grateful that you chose

578
00:28:42,642 --> 00:28:44,283
to spend your hard-earned money on this event.

579
00:28:44,383 --> 00:28:46,104
We hope that you will join us again next year.

580
00:28:46,605 --> 00:28:50,127
And we ask if you would do one thing for us, tweet,

581
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:54,829
post on Facebook, tell someone, get another person

582
00:28:54,849 --> 00:28:57,651
to come next time so that we can grow this community

583
00:28:57,671 --> 00:28:59,192
and we can keep having this conversation.

584
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:00,393
Thanks.

585
00:29:08,481 --> 00:29:08,985
Thank you, sir.

586
00:29:09,428 --> 00:29:09,811
Appreciate it.
