1
00:00:03,738 --> 00:00:06,580
I got to do it this way.

2
00:00:06,580 --> 00:00:08,121
All right.

3
00:00:08,121 --> 00:00:08,921
Hi, everybody.

4
00:00:08,921 --> 00:00:09,742
I'm Dan Cox.

5
00:00:09,742 --> 00:00:13,505
I'm here to talk to you about what modern interior design

6
00:00:13,505 --> 00:00:14,966
teaches us about environment art.

7
00:00:14,966 --> 00:00:18,328
I work at Ubisoft Toronto.

8
00:00:18,328 --> 00:00:19,809
I'm a level artist there.

9
00:00:19,809 --> 00:00:22,231
And recently, I helped ship Splinter Cell Blacklist.

10
00:00:23,099 --> 00:00:27,302
During the entirety of my career, I have been teaching at Seneca College,

11
00:00:27,302 --> 00:00:30,944
teaching environment arts, trying to get people like this to understand

12
00:00:30,944 --> 00:00:33,466
how to make interesting game spaces.

13
00:00:33,466 --> 00:00:37,429
And one of the things that it really taught me was a lot about myself

14
00:00:37,429 --> 00:00:39,530
and a lot about my understandings and misunderstandings

15
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:44,474
about how we may or may not want to actually build environments.

16
00:00:44,474 --> 00:00:48,397
Looking at their spaces, I would often come up with

17
00:00:48,397 --> 00:00:49,918
clichÃ©, silly ideas as to...

18
00:00:50,954 --> 00:00:53,455
what worked, what didn't, I would start to tell them,

19
00:00:53,455 --> 00:00:56,597
make it more blue, make it less blue,

20
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,417
add more details, put in less details.

21
00:00:58,417 --> 00:01:00,038
And it didn't really make any sense.

22
00:01:00,038 --> 00:01:03,140
I didn't have any fundamental specifics that I could work with

23
00:01:03,140 --> 00:01:04,760
to deal with these kinds of things.

24
00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:07,802
And during this time, I was actually watching a lot of HGTV with my wife.

25
00:01:07,802 --> 00:01:13,244
She was watching these shows, and I was starting to watch them as well.

26
00:01:14,035 --> 00:01:18,077
finding them incredibly entertaining. Shows like Sarah 101 and another show, Pure Design,

27
00:01:18,077 --> 00:01:22,979
ended up dealing with a lot of really, really interesting things and developing spaces and

28
00:01:22,979 --> 00:01:27,822
taking something like this and turning it into something like this. And even better

29
00:01:27,822 --> 00:01:32,004
than that, they would start to explain why this room doesn't actually look any good.

30
00:01:32,004 --> 00:01:37,467
The dark cabinets ends up making the room feel smaller. The position of the sink next

31
00:01:37,467 --> 00:01:40,928
to the stove ends up making for a flow that doesn't actually work the way that you'd want.

32
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:43,862
On top of that, the doors in the room,

33
00:01:43,862 --> 00:01:45,924
being a significantly darker color than the walls,

34
00:01:45,924 --> 00:01:47,525
ends up really exaggerating them.

35
00:01:47,525 --> 00:01:49,086
That's not something you want for the room.

36
00:01:49,086 --> 00:01:50,127
They're not an important part.

37
00:01:50,127 --> 00:01:51,608
There's a desk.

38
00:01:51,608 --> 00:01:54,311
There's a window with which you can see a laundry room

39
00:01:54,311 --> 00:01:55,171
on the other side of.

40
00:01:55,171 --> 00:01:57,613
These things end up really confusing the space,

41
00:01:57,613 --> 00:01:59,075
and they would explain these.

42
00:01:59,075 --> 00:02:01,356
And then when they redesign the space,

43
00:02:01,356 --> 00:02:02,457
moving things like a table

44
00:02:02,457 --> 00:02:04,199
and changing the flow of the room

45
00:02:04,199 --> 00:02:06,801
so that you end up being able to move about the space

46
00:02:06,801 --> 00:02:08,222
a lot more, changing the elements

47
00:02:08,222 --> 00:02:10,003
and their specific locations

48
00:02:10,003 --> 00:02:11,385
to make the flow work a lot better.

49
00:02:12,568 --> 00:02:17,229
making the range and the oven and the sink and chairs

50
00:02:17,229 --> 00:02:18,389
all similar colors.

51
00:02:18,389 --> 00:02:21,069
Stainless steel ends up reinforcing their connection

52
00:02:21,069 --> 00:02:21,509
with each other.

53
00:02:21,509 --> 00:02:23,650
They're all functional elements of the room

54
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:25,050
that you're meant to interact with.

55
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,011
And all of these things were really, really interesting,

56
00:02:28,011 --> 00:02:30,611
even taking the window to the laundry room

57
00:02:30,611 --> 00:02:31,911
and making it a frosted window,

58
00:02:31,911 --> 00:02:33,632
still letting light in,

59
00:02:33,632 --> 00:02:35,432
but making sure you still feel like you're in a kitchen.

60
00:02:35,432 --> 00:02:39,193
Which made me think, this works really well for us.

61
00:02:39,646 --> 00:02:44,429
There's a lot that we can get from these types of ideas and rules and setups that I'd not

62
00:02:44,429 --> 00:02:45,490
really heard about before.

63
00:02:45,490 --> 00:02:47,511
But where do we go from here?

64
00:02:47,511 --> 00:02:52,655
Well, first off, I want to talk about how interior designers are just like level artists

65
00:02:52,655 --> 00:02:57,658
or world builders or whatever term we want to use, because we use all the same setups

66
00:02:57,658 --> 00:02:58,639
and techniques.

67
00:02:58,639 --> 00:03:04,103
I also next want to talk about interior design rules and interior designers' tips and techniques

68
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,183
for how they create a space.

69
00:03:06,324 --> 00:03:09,185
And then I want to apply this specifically to game spaces

70
00:03:09,185 --> 00:03:11,686
and see what we can actually get away with

71
00:03:11,686 --> 00:03:14,627
in terms of using some of these ideas.

72
00:03:14,627 --> 00:03:17,127
First off, level artists are interior designers.

73
00:03:17,127 --> 00:03:19,048
And maybe not in the obvious way.

74
00:03:19,048 --> 00:03:21,429
We both build spaces and design them.

75
00:03:21,429 --> 00:03:23,249
That's rather obvious.

76
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,810
But our fundamentals and our cores are actually so much closer

77
00:03:25,810 --> 00:03:26,590
than might be obvious.

78
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:29,551
You might think an interior decorator is just supposed to make a place pretty.

79
00:03:29,551 --> 00:03:31,591
But that's not always their job.

80
00:03:31,591 --> 00:03:34,692
Their job is to create form and function,

81
00:03:34,692 --> 00:03:35,653
just like us.

82
00:03:36,908 --> 00:03:39,449
First off, for an interior designer, they're going to be dealing with form.

83
00:03:39,449 --> 00:03:43,832
Form is going to be defining what the mood and feeling of a space is.

84
00:03:43,832 --> 00:03:46,253
What is the story that's supposed to be evoked from it?

85
00:03:46,253 --> 00:03:49,415
Is it supposed to be a sleeping space and you're supposed to feel calm

86
00:03:49,415 --> 00:03:50,656
and comfortable and warm?

87
00:03:50,656 --> 00:03:53,778
Or are you just supposed to get an interesting narrative

88
00:03:53,778 --> 00:03:56,179
about the people that actually live inside this space?

89
00:03:56,179 --> 00:03:57,220
All of this is form.

90
00:03:57,220 --> 00:04:00,982
And we in games deal with this in the exact same way.

91
00:04:00,982 --> 00:04:03,623
We evoke emotions in a space through form.

92
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:07,280
We tell you the story of the people that exist there,

93
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:09,181
and who might actually live inside that space.

94
00:04:09,181 --> 00:04:09,962
Next, function.

95
00:04:09,962 --> 00:04:13,805
Function is specifically going to be defining

96
00:04:13,805 --> 00:04:14,926
what you do in a space.

97
00:04:14,926 --> 00:04:17,768
And interior designers work with this in the same way we do.

98
00:04:17,768 --> 00:04:20,490
They're going to have a space that's going to be meant for a certain purpose,

99
00:04:20,490 --> 00:04:25,194
and the form is going to have to change to compensate that in some way, shape, or form.

100
00:04:25,194 --> 00:04:30,518
So for example, here, you're meant to be eating in the space.

101
00:04:30,518 --> 00:04:32,800
Or going to the bathroom.

102
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:33,641
Or eating and cooking.

103
00:04:34,582 --> 00:04:38,584
These spaces have a different function and thus are going to visually look different.

104
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:42,246
We have the same thing for games. We have the same setup where in Gears of War you've got a

105
00:04:42,246 --> 00:04:50,291
bunch of chest-high walls, large open spaces with which to shoot. The function changes the

106
00:04:50,291 --> 00:04:52,372
appearance of the space based on what you're doing.

107
00:04:53,693 --> 00:04:58,075
In Mass Effect, a large open space where you can maneuver around an area.

108
00:04:58,075 --> 00:05:02,816
Even the placement of people in the space ends up being somewhat of a design function

109
00:05:02,816 --> 00:05:06,477
for visuals, because you tell people to start talking to the other elements that are inside

110
00:05:06,477 --> 00:05:07,378
of it.

111
00:05:07,378 --> 00:05:12,439
Or something like Prince of Persia, large, long spaces that you can jump across.

112
00:05:12,439 --> 00:05:17,441
Even the light orbs in these kinds of spaces telling you where you're supposed to go next,

113
00:05:17,441 --> 00:05:18,681
leading you about the space.

114
00:05:18,681 --> 00:05:20,902
The function changes how something looks.

115
00:05:23,315 --> 00:05:25,136
But in all of this, we need a balance of intent.

116
00:05:25,136 --> 00:05:29,958
If we don't have that, we can end up with spaces like this.

117
00:05:29,958 --> 00:05:31,939
This space is all function over form.

118
00:05:31,939 --> 00:05:34,400
It's a very confusing space to look at.

119
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,121
It's hard to make out all the elements that are in there.

120
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:38,782
And it's even hard in some situations

121
00:05:38,782 --> 00:05:40,142
to actually understand right away

122
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:43,004
what is the purpose of the space.

123
00:05:43,004 --> 00:05:45,005
Its function is generally supposed to be a gameplay room.

124
00:05:45,005 --> 00:05:47,546
But sometimes things like the gameplay advance poster

125
00:05:47,546 --> 00:05:50,467
or even the sofa ends up actually distracting

126
00:05:50,467 --> 00:05:52,548
from the main functional element here, which is the TV.

127
00:05:53,303 --> 00:05:55,865
with a little bit more of a balance of that form,

128
00:05:55,865 --> 00:05:57,326
we can end up with something a bit more like this.

129
00:05:57,326 --> 00:06:00,967
Something where you understand what the purpose of the space is

130
00:06:00,967 --> 00:06:02,288
and can work with it a lot better.

131
00:06:02,288 --> 00:06:06,070
This is not necessarily a better space than another one,

132
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:08,851
but it evokes the certain types of feelings and moods

133
00:06:08,851 --> 00:06:12,333
that we're supposed to be getting right away.

134
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:13,574
Uncharted dealt with this.

135
00:06:13,574 --> 00:06:16,035
The first Uncharted ends up having a lot of scenarios

136
00:06:16,035 --> 00:06:18,196
where you can get confused and lost

137
00:06:18,196 --> 00:06:21,078
because it happens to be a little bit of form over function.

138
00:06:21,838 --> 00:06:24,799
The players don't necessarily know what they need to do

139
00:06:24,799 --> 00:06:26,340
because it looks like a ruin

140
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:28,041
and too many things look very, very similar

141
00:06:28,041 --> 00:06:29,121
and you don't know what to grab.

142
00:06:29,121 --> 00:06:32,403
Naughty Dog dealt with this in Uncharted 2

143
00:06:32,403 --> 00:06:35,544
by drawing out more contrast for the functional elements.

144
00:06:35,544 --> 00:06:38,846
By making sure that grabbing spaces become red

145
00:06:38,846 --> 00:06:40,547
and evoke a certain emotion

146
00:06:40,547 --> 00:06:43,008
so that you can grab them right away.

147
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,769
Tanks draw out their contrast from the ground

148
00:06:44,769 --> 00:06:45,989
so you can make sure you know

149
00:06:45,989 --> 00:06:47,230
what you're always interacting with.

150
00:06:50,392 --> 00:06:54,994
With all that in mind, we want to look at the rules. If we are the exact same as an

151
00:06:54,994 --> 00:06:59,596
interior designer, then we really want to make sure to look at the rules that they use

152
00:06:59,596 --> 00:07:07,299
and see how they can apply to us. First off, we want to look at lighting, balance, emphasis,

153
00:07:07,299 --> 00:07:12,142
contrast, rhythm, repetition, and proportion and scale. These are many of the rules that

154
00:07:12,142 --> 00:07:17,864
the fundamental ideas that interior designers use, and we can look at them. First off, lighting,

155
00:07:17,864 --> 00:07:20,045
but we're not going to talk about lighting.

156
00:07:20,968 --> 00:07:24,832
Because it's way too big. It's a huge, huge, huge all-encompassing topic, and there's no

157
00:07:24,832 --> 00:07:29,336
way I can cover it in this talk. However, one of the things I find really interesting

158
00:07:29,336 --> 00:07:36,664
is that interior designers specifically deal with light fixtures. For interior designers,

159
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,747
light fixtures are actually, like, one of the biggest points of contrast in a room.

160
00:07:39,747 --> 00:07:43,170
And thus, they draw the eye to it the most.

161
00:07:43,806 --> 00:07:49,127
And thus it becomes one of the most important parts for defining how a space is going to feel and look.

162
00:07:49,127 --> 00:07:50,828
It's a big design element.

163
00:07:50,828 --> 00:07:55,109
Each of these spaces, the light fixture happens to be one of the most interesting things in the room.

164
00:07:55,109 --> 00:07:59,070
Which is really useful for us, especially for things like what I worked on Spinner Cell.

165
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:00,850
You're supposed to shoot lights.

166
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,371
They should be the most interesting thing to see.

167
00:08:02,371 --> 00:08:05,291
We can look at contrast.

168
00:08:05,291 --> 00:08:10,293
Contrast is going to be a fundamental underpinning element between everything.

169
00:08:10,293 --> 00:08:13,213
Contrast can change a room like this to this.

170
00:08:14,547 --> 00:08:18,871
What's happening here is specifically we see one room where the function is a sitting room

171
00:08:18,871 --> 00:08:23,836
where you watch TV. By just changing the contrast and de-emphasizing the TV, not even removing

172
00:08:23,836 --> 00:08:29,662
it, but just de-emphasizing it, the room feels like it has a different function even though

173
00:08:29,662 --> 00:08:34,066
none of the elements have actually technically changed. Nothing's been removed. Just contrast

174
00:08:34,066 --> 00:08:37,769
has been adjusted. This leads us to emphasis.

175
00:08:38,545 --> 00:08:40,666
Contrast is going to help us deal with emphasis.

176
00:08:40,666 --> 00:08:47,289
Now contrast and emphasis can happen due to contrasts in shape, form, color, value.

177
00:08:47,289 --> 00:08:50,430
Any of those kinds of things will create more emphasis

178
00:08:50,430 --> 00:08:53,132
and will allow us to focus on different elements, leading us around.

179
00:08:53,132 --> 00:08:58,034
Emphasis is really important for understanding where to lead players or people

180
00:08:58,034 --> 00:09:01,195
to certain elements and move them about a space.

181
00:09:01,195 --> 00:09:04,596
Specifically, it can emphasize proportions

182
00:09:04,596 --> 00:09:07,378
or specifically the function of a space.

183
00:09:08,383 --> 00:09:10,084
So in this space, we have a table.

184
00:09:10,084 --> 00:09:13,264
The table is emphasized from the walls,

185
00:09:13,264 --> 00:09:16,245
which gives you the sense that you're supposed to interact

186
00:09:16,245 --> 00:09:17,825
with that specifically.

187
00:09:17,825 --> 00:09:19,786
Or the chair is emphasized from the other surfaces

188
00:09:19,786 --> 00:09:21,886
in the space, meaning you're supposed to sit there.

189
00:09:21,886 --> 00:09:24,646
These are the things that you're supposed to move to

190
00:09:24,646 --> 00:09:26,727
because they're the most emphasized.

191
00:09:26,727 --> 00:09:29,927
One thing that I love that interior designers deal with,

192
00:09:29,927 --> 00:09:30,747
and one of the things that I think

193
00:09:30,747 --> 00:09:32,508
it's the most appropriate for us,

194
00:09:32,508 --> 00:09:34,048
is the fact that interior designers

195
00:09:34,048 --> 00:09:36,108
always have to deal with full spaces.

196
00:09:36,879 --> 00:09:40,862
Unlike movies or concept art or certain other elements,

197
00:09:40,862 --> 00:09:44,305
where you might just have to focus on singular 2D composition,

198
00:09:44,305 --> 00:09:48,689
interior designers have to deal with what is all around you at all times,

199
00:09:48,689 --> 00:09:54,074
which means they have to focus on emphasis in all areas in some way, shape, or form.

200
00:09:54,074 --> 00:09:55,515
So in a space like this,

201
00:09:55,515 --> 00:09:58,697
we have a problem with a lack of emphasis on one side of the room.

202
00:09:58,697 --> 00:10:01,320
The bed is overemphasized from the other side.

203
00:10:02,108 --> 00:10:06,552
to re-emphasize that area, to make sure that you have a better set of focal points around

204
00:10:06,552 --> 00:10:12,035
this space, we want to re-emphasize the other side, creating some elements that lead you

205
00:10:12,035 --> 00:10:18,800
about the space so you don't feel like it's actually empty. Next, we can look at balance,

206
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,683
symmetrical balance specifically first. Symmetrical balance is when one side of a space does

207
00:10:23,683 --> 00:10:26,385
not necessarily override or overpower another one.

208
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:32,883
Symmetrical balance can end up creating a space that's peaceful, calm, maybe somewhat

209
00:10:32,883 --> 00:10:33,564
formal.

210
00:10:33,564 --> 00:10:35,125
It can have a strong impact.

211
00:10:35,125 --> 00:10:38,587
However, if it's overdone, it can be somewhat isolating and intimidating.

212
00:10:38,587 --> 00:10:42,950
One of the things I like about it the most is it can lead you through a space as opposed

213
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,972
to around it, where asymmetry comes in.

214
00:10:45,972 --> 00:10:51,035
Asymmetry is very useful for leading you about a space, making sure that you can explore

215
00:10:51,035 --> 00:10:51,976
a little bit more.

216
00:10:51,976 --> 00:10:53,417
It's more casual.

217
00:10:53,417 --> 00:10:56,159
It's really a lot more exciting.

218
00:10:58,244 --> 00:11:04,368
it can get really chaotic if you overdo it. Next, we can look at repetition. Repetition

219
00:11:04,368 --> 00:11:08,111
is a really interesting thing, especially when it's used by some really good interior

220
00:11:08,111 --> 00:11:12,694
designers. Oftentimes, they'll end up taking a painting for a space, like in our first

221
00:11:12,694 --> 00:11:12,934
image.

222
00:11:13,722 --> 00:11:18,943
and they'll end up using that painting as the focal point for color in the whole space.

223
00:11:18,943 --> 00:11:22,983
Every set of colors is derived from whatever is in the painting.

224
00:11:22,983 --> 00:11:26,084
That's the through line for the room, and it ties everything together,

225
00:11:26,084 --> 00:11:28,564
no matter what the shape or other elements are.

226
00:11:28,564 --> 00:11:31,625
If we look at the next example, we can see that there are a number of elements

227
00:11:31,625 --> 00:11:35,046
that all have the same color, but their shape and form is different.

228
00:11:35,046 --> 00:11:36,366
Some are soft, some aren't.

229
00:11:36,366 --> 00:11:39,667
But they still work because of that through line of color.

230
00:11:39,667 --> 00:11:42,947
Because the elements are repeated, they work.

231
00:11:43,645 --> 00:11:48,008
The repeated element here being white, even though the shapes don't match, it still works

232
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:55,394
because of that through line. Even in this space, which might not be a necessarily appealing

233
00:11:55,394 --> 00:12:00,297
space for a number of people, but there's that through line of shape. Large rectilinear

234
00:12:00,297 --> 00:12:05,521
elements end up tying everything together, even though the color scheme doesn't necessarily

235
00:12:05,521 --> 00:12:10,145
tie itself together nearly as much. It's not as obvious. But because there's that through

236
00:12:10,145 --> 00:12:11,926
line, the space still works.

237
00:12:13,813 --> 00:12:16,114
I like to think of this as gradients as well.

238
00:12:16,114 --> 00:12:21,696
A gradient through a space can lead your eye through it and allow you to feel a bit more

239
00:12:21,696 --> 00:12:24,196
moved through the space and a little bit more of that excitement.

240
00:12:24,196 --> 00:12:28,718
In this space, we have dark lower cabinets and light upper cabinets.

241
00:12:28,718 --> 00:12:30,858
In here, your eye is moved upwards.

242
00:12:30,858 --> 00:12:37,060
In this space, we've got dark lower areas and light upper areas, but we also have a

243
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:38,741
movement of shape.

244
00:12:38,741 --> 00:12:42,062
We have large lower elements and then thin higher up elements.

245
00:12:43,265 --> 00:12:45,866
This space has no rhythm, or very little.

246
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,567
And so your eye is stuck.

247
00:12:47,567 --> 00:12:49,108
It doesn't move about as much as it could.

248
00:12:49,108 --> 00:12:51,169
If you look at proportion and scale,

249
00:12:51,169 --> 00:12:53,790
one thing that I really like that interior designers do

250
00:12:53,790 --> 00:12:58,773
with proportion and scale is make a small space feel bigger

251
00:12:58,773 --> 00:13:01,074
simply through the elements that are inside of it.

252
00:13:01,074 --> 00:13:03,896
By having clear, transparent objects,

253
00:13:03,896 --> 00:13:07,078
or objects with thin lines where you can see through,

254
00:13:07,078 --> 00:13:09,899
you end up getting a situation where you feel

255
00:13:09,899 --> 00:13:11,740
like you're in a larger space than you actually are.

256
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:16,542
If we get the opposite, the space can feel a little bit more constricting and smaller.

257
00:13:16,542 --> 00:13:20,945
And we need to keep this in mind when we're dealing with larger spaces,

258
00:13:20,945 --> 00:13:25,929
because we'll end up in a situation where we want to use large elements to fill that space

259
00:13:25,929 --> 00:13:26,850
so that it doesn't feel too empty.

260
00:13:26,850 --> 00:13:29,352
Now this is not a very big room,

261
00:13:29,352 --> 00:13:33,816
but because the elements inside it are so small and you can see through so many elements,

262
00:13:33,816 --> 00:13:38,400
it ends up feeling a lot larger than it actually is.

263
00:13:39,509 --> 00:13:40,970
if we just change proportion and scale,

264
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:43,531
the space can feel a lot cozier.

265
00:13:43,531 --> 00:13:47,613
Again, not necessarily better than the other situation,

266
00:13:47,613 --> 00:13:49,915
but it gives a different mood and feeling for the space.

267
00:13:49,915 --> 00:13:54,437
Now let's look at interior designers' tips and techniques.

268
00:13:54,437 --> 00:13:58,019
The thing that I really wanted to get out of this

269
00:13:58,019 --> 00:14:01,901
was to show how we can apply seemingly arbitrary elements

270
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:03,722
together and still have them apply

271
00:14:03,722 --> 00:14:04,863
to exactly what we're doing.

272
00:14:06,069 --> 00:14:10,733
First off, one rule I like that they deal with is don't fight the architecture.

273
00:14:10,733 --> 00:14:13,054
Interior designers can't just drop a ceiling in a room.

274
00:14:13,054 --> 00:14:15,316
It's hugely expensive.

275
00:14:15,316 --> 00:14:16,937
It's much more expensive than it is for us.

276
00:14:16,937 --> 00:14:20,620
But the thing that I love is when they don't fight the architecture,

277
00:14:20,620 --> 00:14:23,442
they use the kinds of rules that sometimes we don't have to,

278
00:14:23,442 --> 00:14:25,244
which is really interesting.

279
00:14:25,244 --> 00:14:29,026
Dealing with those constraints is always helpful for us.

280
00:14:29,026 --> 00:14:33,290
So when a level designer gives us a situation that we can't readily work with,

281
00:14:33,290 --> 00:14:35,832
or we want to drop a ceiling because, ah, the room's too tall.

282
00:14:36,682 --> 00:14:39,003
but maybe there are other gameplay elements that we have to change.

283
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:42,304
We can start to focus on the way that they deal with stuff like that in here.

284
00:14:42,304 --> 00:14:45,166
So for this situation, the ceiling's too high.

285
00:14:45,166 --> 00:14:47,667
But we can't just drop the ceiling height.

286
00:14:47,667 --> 00:14:49,268
Maybe we can add in things like crown molding.

287
00:14:49,268 --> 00:14:53,850
The crown molding gives us a bit of an eyeline element that we can use

288
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:57,552
to de-emphasize a bit of the ceiling element

289
00:14:57,552 --> 00:14:58,853
and bring our eye down a bit more,

290
00:14:58,853 --> 00:15:00,673
making it feel a little bit more intimate.

291
00:15:00,673 --> 00:15:03,315
Or lead the eye back up again,

292
00:15:03,315 --> 00:15:05,536
still keeping in that crown molding.

293
00:15:06,130 --> 00:15:08,051
but allowing us to look at the higher area.

294
00:15:08,051 --> 00:15:11,013
However, this is de-emphasizing the table a little bit,

295
00:15:11,013 --> 00:15:13,954
which is supposed to be the focal point of the space.

296
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:16,755
We could instead use something like valence beams,

297
00:15:16,755 --> 00:15:19,016
which are a really interesting element

298
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,738
for actually lowering the ceiling height artificially

299
00:15:22,738 --> 00:15:24,399
and still allowing a ton of light in

300
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:27,320
and the feeling of height in the space without explicit height.

301
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:28,060
Next, the 30-60-10 rule.

302
00:15:28,060 --> 00:15:30,861
This is a really interesting one that I stumbled across,

303
00:15:30,861 --> 00:15:32,622
which was really neat because...

304
00:15:34,207 --> 00:15:36,148
It's really good for dealing with a color scheme.

305
00:15:36,148 --> 00:15:38,428
So you start off with 60% of your room

306
00:15:38,428 --> 00:15:40,229
being a large dominant color.

307
00:15:40,229 --> 00:15:41,949
That's somewhat desaturated.

308
00:15:41,949 --> 00:15:43,850
Your intermediate color, which takes up 30% of the space,

309
00:15:43,850 --> 00:15:45,930
can be more saturated.

310
00:15:45,930 --> 00:15:50,091
And 10% can often be meant for large, bold pops of color.

311
00:15:50,091 --> 00:15:53,292
It's useful in a number of situations.

312
00:15:53,292 --> 00:15:56,553
And it's really, really powerful for creating a nice color

313
00:15:56,553 --> 00:15:59,373
scheme that tends to work together really nicely.

314
00:15:59,373 --> 00:16:01,454
It also works for most design in general,

315
00:16:01,454 --> 00:16:02,374
including a men's suit.

316
00:16:03,301 --> 00:16:06,262
and same with that color scheme, that can just come right back into another room as

317
00:16:06,262 --> 00:16:12,225
well. But, how do we apply this to games? The most important part is trying to realize

318
00:16:12,225 --> 00:16:19,708
that even though interior designers are dealing with feature walls and pillows and patterns

319
00:16:19,708 --> 00:16:23,390
and wallpaper, and we seem like we're dealing with something entirely different, we're not.

320
00:16:23,390 --> 00:16:27,292
We're dealing with shape, color, value, all of the same fundamental elements. So all of

321
00:16:27,292 --> 00:16:32,574
these things should be applicable. But first, let's look at an interior design space.

322
00:16:33,608 --> 00:16:37,471
Dishonored has great art. I absolutely love what they've done with their spaces.

323
00:16:37,471 --> 00:16:41,414
But what if things didn't work so well? What if there was a problem with the space?

324
00:16:41,414 --> 00:16:44,776
What if, for example, the space ends up feeling a bit too tall?

325
00:16:44,776 --> 00:16:49,800
Removing some of these elements that were making the space feel a bit more stable and human,

326
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:52,021
when they're removed, we end up with a bit of a problem.

327
00:16:52,021 --> 00:16:57,004
However, if we adjust the space, if we create a bit more rhythm,

328
00:16:57,004 --> 00:16:59,446
by just adjusting some of the palette here,

329
00:16:59,446 --> 00:17:01,788
darkening the floors and lightening the walls,

330
00:17:02,852 --> 00:17:05,513
we create a bit more of a rhythm through the space,

331
00:17:05,513 --> 00:17:07,775
which works quite a bit better than it did before,

332
00:17:07,775 --> 00:17:08,435
without that rhythm.

333
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:11,117
Next, we can start applying the 60-30-10 rule.

334
00:17:11,117 --> 00:17:15,500
In this situation, we can end up with something

335
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:19,083
that's going to lead our eye around a little bit more.

336
00:17:19,083 --> 00:17:22,745
On top of that, we can start applying some lights in the scene

337
00:17:22,745 --> 00:17:24,246
in a specific eyeline.

338
00:17:24,246 --> 00:17:29,710
This allows us to actually have one specific height for the space

339
00:17:29,710 --> 00:17:31,872
where we didn't have that element anymore.

340
00:17:34,477 --> 00:17:40,540
and comparing. Again, not necessarily a better space, but it fixes some of the problems that

341
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:45,483
we've run into previously. Next, I want to look at a level I was working on for Splinter

342
00:17:45,483 --> 00:17:51,547
Cell Blacklist. This was supposed to be a liquid natural gas refinery. This is not supposed

343
00:17:51,547 --> 00:17:57,451
to be a designed space. This is pure form over function over form.

344
00:17:58,340 --> 00:18:01,201
It's not supposed to feel like a design space.

345
00:18:01,201 --> 00:18:02,242
Otherwise, it's not proper.

346
00:18:02,242 --> 00:18:03,962
It's not really the way it's supposed to feel.

347
00:18:03,962 --> 00:18:05,443
And this is what we did.

348
00:18:05,443 --> 00:18:08,344
We consistently focused on building out the space

349
00:18:08,344 --> 00:18:09,745
with function over form,

350
00:18:09,745 --> 00:18:13,126
which ended up sometimes making the space very confusing early on.

351
00:18:13,126 --> 00:18:16,808
And we had to use some techniques that were a little bit heavy-handed

352
00:18:16,808 --> 00:18:18,609
to lead the player around

353
00:18:18,609 --> 00:18:20,170
because players got confused really early on

354
00:18:20,170 --> 00:18:21,430
as to where they were supposed to go.

355
00:18:22,945 --> 00:18:25,126
So in this space, for example, it's a sandbox area.

356
00:18:25,126 --> 00:18:28,288
We're supposed to move about and grab certain elements.

357
00:18:28,288 --> 00:18:30,950
However, I want to focus on one specific area.

358
00:18:30,950 --> 00:18:35,493
Moving to the side, coming up the staircase,

359
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:36,474
looking over to the right.

360
00:18:36,474 --> 00:18:39,837
And in this area, this is where there's a number of terrorists

361
00:18:39,837 --> 00:18:41,638
and you're supposed to go get them.

362
00:18:41,638 --> 00:18:43,759
I don't want to emphasize that area too much,

363
00:18:43,759 --> 00:18:46,061
because it already starts to get confusing to even look at right away.

364
00:18:46,061 --> 00:18:51,285
If we come back, we jump over this railing.

365
00:18:52,266 --> 00:18:56,707
and we go down this pipe. This leads us to another area. And a number of people got confused

366
00:18:56,707 --> 00:19:01,108
trying to get to this space. It wasn't heavily headed, people weren't heading to it a lot.

367
00:19:01,108 --> 00:19:05,629
And I wanted to look at some ways, at least early on, we did start to resolve some of

368
00:19:05,629 --> 00:19:10,950
these. Going back a bit, there we go. So I want to look at how to adjust this space,

369
00:19:10,950 --> 00:19:16,751
how to change the feel of it a bit more to lead a person about. First off, rhythm. All

370
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:20,112
of these are subtle, simple changes.

371
00:19:20,485 --> 00:19:22,387
which is why I think they're the most applicable for us.

372
00:19:22,387 --> 00:19:25,790
But even just changing the rhythm of the space

373
00:19:25,790 --> 00:19:28,172
leads our eye up and tends to make the space

374
00:19:28,172 --> 00:19:29,192
a little bit more interesting to look at.

375
00:19:29,192 --> 00:19:33,136
Next, we can look at de-emphasizing that large pillar.

376
00:19:33,136 --> 00:19:36,799
There's a ton of pipes and a ton of contrast on that element,

377
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:38,620
but we're not supposed to interact with it.

378
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:39,581
Why are we emphasizing it?

379
00:19:39,581 --> 00:19:42,764
If we think about emphasis, we want to pull that away

380
00:19:42,764 --> 00:19:45,466
and create something a bit more simple.

381
00:19:45,466 --> 00:19:48,128
Next, asymmetrical balance.

382
00:19:48,128 --> 00:19:49,309
Or rather, symmetrical balance.

383
00:19:50,097 --> 00:19:56,018
creating a bit more symmetrical balance in this space can lead us through it instead

384
00:19:56,018 --> 00:20:00,979
of around it. Because right now, we only have two paths. So by creating the similar patterns

385
00:20:00,979 --> 00:20:07,140
that we have on the right, we can end up with a space that's a little bit more symmetrical

386
00:20:07,140 --> 00:20:17,082
and a little bit less chaotic. Got to lower those lights. Dark images for Splinter Cell.

387
00:20:18,099 --> 00:20:20,941
area we come into next because we don't want to think about this as just two-dimensional

388
00:20:20,941 --> 00:20:25,045
compositions because we always need to think about it as a space you move through or around.

389
00:20:25,045 --> 00:20:29,549
I wanted to repeat the same elements that I had before, darkening the floor,

390
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:34,454
creating some of that symmetrical balance. But then I also wanted to look at

391
00:20:34,454 --> 00:20:37,817
re-emphasizing those light sources. It's Splinter Cell, we're supposed to shoot them.

392
00:20:38,315 --> 00:20:41,416
And the nice thing about these elements is that because they're the highest point of

393
00:20:41,416 --> 00:20:46,237
focus, you're really going to start looking at them and they tell a story about the space

394
00:20:46,237 --> 00:20:50,459
we're in. They're a design element as well as an emphasis point. Next, changing some

395
00:20:50,459 --> 00:20:56,420
of the elements here to create a little bit more flow and a little bit more directionality

396
00:20:56,420 --> 00:21:02,422
and reemphasizing the other area with a number of catwalks and pillars that weren't there

397
00:21:02,422 --> 00:21:02,622
before.

398
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:15,906
Moving up the stairs, we end up in this space, which is an incredibly complex looking area.

399
00:21:15,906 --> 00:21:19,068
There's a lot of detail and a lot of contrast in all spots.

400
00:21:19,068 --> 00:21:23,029
If we darken the floor again, we de-emphasize that space.

401
00:21:23,029 --> 00:21:24,430
You're not supposed to interact with it.

402
00:21:24,430 --> 00:21:26,291
We can lead the eye away from it.

403
00:21:26,291 --> 00:21:28,272
It's a common one. I like doing it. It's really nice.

404
00:21:28,272 --> 00:21:29,052
Gives a good effect.

405
00:21:29,052 --> 00:21:35,555
Next, de-emphasizing that wall again, keeping it a bit more simple and just consistency.

406
00:21:37,380 --> 00:21:39,822
Next, de-emphasizing this element.

407
00:21:39,822 --> 00:21:43,283
Again, we see too many details through the other spaces

408
00:21:43,283 --> 00:21:44,564
that we don't need to see.

409
00:21:44,564 --> 00:21:48,646
So we de-emphasize that and make sure you don't get lost.

410
00:21:48,646 --> 00:21:52,628
This back wall was also becoming a big point

411
00:21:52,628 --> 00:21:55,370
where you'd feel like you need to head towards it,

412
00:21:55,370 --> 00:21:57,831
but you don't do anything there.

413
00:21:57,831 --> 00:22:00,012
That door, you're not supposed to go through.

414
00:22:00,012 --> 00:22:03,414
So by de-emphasizing it, lowering the contrast in that space,

415
00:22:03,414 --> 00:22:05,655
we end up with something a bit more manageable

416
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:06,475
and less distracting.

417
00:22:08,688 --> 00:22:16,970
Next, adding in, it's hard to see there, adding in some of the green text on the wall and

418
00:22:16,970 --> 00:22:21,952
leading some pipes down to the other area means that now, even if we're left like this,

419
00:22:21,952 --> 00:22:26,753
the players are led much closer to the area where they're supposed to interact with, which

420
00:22:26,753 --> 00:22:32,035
means I don't have to focus on really heavy-handed signaling to tell somebody to go there because

421
00:22:32,035 --> 00:22:35,676
there's a number of elements that lead you there already. But if we wanted to push it

422
00:22:35,676 --> 00:22:35,976
further?

423
00:22:36,656 --> 00:22:41,660
We can start putting in some simple coloring across the areas where you're supposed to interact with.

424
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:45,144
We can re-emphasize that light source, leading you back into that area.

425
00:22:45,144 --> 00:22:49,127
And even just de-emphasizing other elements some more,

426
00:22:49,127 --> 00:22:52,210
so that you really don't end up going where you're not supposed to,

427
00:22:52,210 --> 00:22:53,511
or getting confused by other elements.

428
00:22:53,511 --> 00:22:59,176
And all of these areas are still applicable.

429
00:22:59,176 --> 00:23:01,698
If we can do it on a liquid natural gas refinery,

430
00:23:01,698 --> 00:23:04,020
we can do this on caves, mountains.

431
00:23:04,678 --> 00:23:06,679
other areas that you're working with, exteriors,

432
00:23:06,679 --> 00:23:10,340
all of these same rules and ideas apply.

433
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,001
It's not just for feature walls and pillows,

434
00:23:12,001 --> 00:23:15,842
because it's all fundamental elements that we always deal with anyways.

435
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:21,264
In closing, we want to look at interior design for inspiration.

436
00:23:21,264 --> 00:23:24,986
Sometimes we can end up creating similar cliche things

437
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,027
like I would be doing with my students.

438
00:23:27,027 --> 00:23:29,468
When I was constantly coming back to movies and games

439
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:32,649
and the things that I'd see there,

440
00:23:32,649 --> 00:23:34,270
to tell them how to fix a space.

441
00:23:35,023 --> 00:23:38,905
Interior design can be something that we can come to to see new ideas, fresh elements,

442
00:23:38,905 --> 00:23:41,267
and fresh ideas that we weren't thinking of before.

443
00:23:41,267 --> 00:23:45,429
It's useful for getting a better understanding of our goals and intentions.

444
00:23:45,429 --> 00:23:49,351
Do we want more repetition in a space to fix areas that aren't working together?

445
00:23:49,351 --> 00:23:54,053
Do we want to use more rhythm in the space to lead the eye about?

446
00:23:54,053 --> 00:23:56,654
Do we want to have more form over function?

447
00:23:56,654 --> 00:24:00,676
Do we want to tell more of a story than we want players to necessarily understand exactly

448
00:24:00,676 --> 00:24:01,597
what they're supposed to do?

449
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:06,712
Interior design can help give us some of those ideas and goals and intentions for a space.

450
00:24:06,712 --> 00:24:15,313
It gives us history. We can start to understand where we came from as a career, as a job, and as a craft.

451
00:24:15,313 --> 00:24:19,454
It's really useful for us to get that kind of insight.

452
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:20,814
And educational accessibility.

453
00:24:20,814 --> 00:24:25,075
The thing is, I don't have a degree in interior design.

454
00:24:25,075 --> 00:24:29,096
I've never taken that kind of education. I watched HGTV.

455
00:24:31,427 --> 00:24:37,449
And we all can. It's useful for that. It's a really accessible way to get this information.

456
00:24:37,449 --> 00:24:41,611
One thing that I don't want to look at is games and movies for inspiration as to how

457
00:24:41,611 --> 00:24:46,272
to create game environments. Because they're not three-dimensional. They don't deal with

458
00:24:46,272 --> 00:24:53,555
all sides like we need to. So, why not watch HGTV? This is an ad. This is an ad, apparently.

459
00:24:56,197 --> 00:25:00,539
All of this stuff is actually available online for free, which is great. You can watch shows

460
00:25:00,539 --> 00:25:04,221
like Sarah 101 and specifically Pure Design. Those are two shows that I actually learned

461
00:25:04,221 --> 00:25:08,883
a lot from really early on. They're very specific and very clear as to what you need to learn.

462
00:25:08,883 --> 00:25:14,886
You can also look at interior design blogs, specifically ones that focus on all sides

463
00:25:14,886 --> 00:25:24,872
of a space, not just one singular image. Shows, blogs like Fresh Home, Decorate.

464
00:25:26,099 --> 00:25:28,580
Home design find and apartment therapy

465
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:30,801
are great places to go to for this information.

466
00:25:30,801 --> 00:25:35,824
In closing, we want to look at interior design

467
00:25:35,824 --> 00:25:40,146
to better understand who we are as a craft

468
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:41,947
and as a job and what we do.

469
00:25:41,947 --> 00:25:44,228
It's really valuable for us.

470
00:25:44,228 --> 00:25:46,089
It may not always make a space better,

471
00:25:46,089 --> 00:25:47,710
but it'll help us better understand

472
00:25:47,710 --> 00:25:48,990
what we're really trying to do

473
00:25:48,990 --> 00:25:51,111
and what we're really trying to accomplish in them.

474
00:25:51,111 --> 00:25:52,652
Thanks.

475
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:09,988
Oh, and I think there's, is there time for questions or no? Okay, there's no time for

476
00:26:09,988 --> 00:26:15,893
questions. I will be at the wrap-up room. So, if you do have any questions and you want

477
00:26:15,893 --> 00:26:19,896
to ask, I'll be there. Otherwise, I'll be at the YubiBooth at 4.30 today as well. So,

478
00:26:19,896 --> 00:26:20,356
see you then.
