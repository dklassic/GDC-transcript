1
00:00:04,232 --> 00:00:08,254
Okay, hello, this is opportunity cost effective

2
00:00:08,495 --> 00:00:09,775
marketing and PR for indies.

3
00:00:10,496 --> 00:00:12,917
My name is Chris Dwyer and I don't know,

4
00:00:12,957 --> 00:00:13,757
I do a lot of stuff.

5
00:00:14,738 --> 00:00:16,339
So what to expect from this talk?

6
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:20,321
It's kind of a different talk from most marketing talks

7
00:00:20,341 --> 00:00:20,901
you're used to.

8
00:00:21,561 --> 00:00:25,123
This is kind of more of a mindset and emotional talk.

9
00:00:26,364 --> 00:00:29,265
So yeah, who am I is gonna be the first thing I talk about.

10
00:00:29,806 --> 00:00:30,926
What is marketing and PR?

11
00:00:32,114 --> 00:00:33,775
whatever, we all know, but I'm gonna talk about it

12
00:00:33,795 --> 00:00:34,176
a little bit.

13
00:00:34,476 --> 00:00:37,938
And then also my approach to marketing and PR.

14
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,681
There's gonna be no stats during this talk

15
00:00:42,422 --> 00:00:44,223
and there's gonna be no fucking charts.

16
00:00:45,564 --> 00:00:47,085
So no Steam Spy ones.

17
00:00:48,266 --> 00:00:51,288
So this is me, I don't know, like a couple months ago.

18
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,110
And this is what I used to do.

19
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:57,733
I used to be an account manager and brand strategist

20
00:00:57,873 --> 00:00:59,394
for consumer packaged goods.

21
00:01:03,123 --> 00:01:06,386
So the Allegra allergy brand packaging,

22
00:01:06,926 --> 00:01:09,408
I'm pretty responsible for a lot of the strategy

23
00:01:09,468 --> 00:01:14,072
behind kind of those USB descriptors and so on.

24
00:01:14,793 --> 00:01:16,995
Philips Colon Health, if you look at the back of the box,

25
00:01:17,035 --> 00:01:21,178
I've written some copy about digestive probiotic caps.

26
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:23,620
It's very exciting stuff.

27
00:01:24,736 --> 00:01:26,798
But I didn't find it was totally fulfilling.

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:29,821
So I started doing video games.

29
00:01:30,421 --> 00:01:32,923
And over the last two years or so,

30
00:01:32,983 --> 00:01:33,984
this is what I've been up to.

31
00:01:34,605 --> 00:01:37,007
I've been working with Gone Home for consoles,

32
00:01:37,767 --> 00:01:41,350
the wonderful folks at Finji, N++, Thumper,

33
00:01:41,831 --> 00:01:43,592
and currently The Signal from Tova.

34
00:01:44,993 --> 00:01:47,776
I also work for the best video game distributor

35
00:01:48,276 --> 00:01:49,938
in the entire business, itch.io.

36
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:54,521
So marketing and PR.

37
00:01:55,781 --> 00:01:58,122
It's weird and it's kind of dumb.

38
00:01:59,323 --> 00:02:02,404
So basically, you have a player and you have your thing.

39
00:02:03,605 --> 00:02:06,226
And theoretically, there should just be a straight line

40
00:02:06,746 --> 00:02:09,147
between getting the player to purchase your thing

41
00:02:09,187 --> 00:02:09,887
or find your thing.

42
00:02:11,282 --> 00:02:13,864
There's this kind of weird thing called marketing and PR

43
00:02:13,884 --> 00:02:16,485
in between there that happens in between.

44
00:02:16,505 --> 00:02:19,427
And it takes the form of press articles,

45
00:02:20,287 --> 00:02:22,408
trailers, screenshots, GIFs,

46
00:02:23,569 --> 00:02:25,370
copy on your Steam page, anything.

47
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:28,572
So it kind of looks like that when you zoom in a little bit.

48
00:02:29,072 --> 00:02:30,653
But let's zoom in a little bit more.

49
00:02:30,673 --> 00:02:32,674
Whoa, okay.

50
00:02:34,438 --> 00:02:35,879
it gets kind of really screwed up.

51
00:02:36,819 --> 00:02:39,360
So yeah, marketing's really complex and weird.

52
00:02:41,361 --> 00:02:42,901
These lines can represent anything,

53
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:44,502
you know, your game getting announced

54
00:02:44,562 --> 00:02:46,042
and then being quiet for a while,

55
00:02:46,623 --> 00:02:47,663
or having a screenshot,

56
00:02:47,843 --> 00:02:50,184
or maybe you release a trailer that doesn't get picked up.

57
00:02:51,244 --> 00:02:53,165
A lot of weird things can happen over the course.

58
00:02:54,206 --> 00:02:56,426
So what can you even do about any of this?

59
00:02:58,302 --> 00:03:02,265
You can start early with basically before you even make a game.

60
00:03:02,885 --> 00:03:07,008
There's a talk and an article by Adam Saltzman and Ryan Clark,

61
00:03:07,408 --> 00:03:10,851
who are two vastly more intelligent human beings than me,

62
00:03:11,651 --> 00:03:13,232
about how to decide what to make.

63
00:03:15,434 --> 00:03:17,475
If you're not designing the game already,

64
00:03:17,515 --> 00:03:20,557
you should be looking at these articles to decide what to make

65
00:03:21,138 --> 00:03:24,100
and basically find something that is kind of the in-between

66
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:26,661
between your creative and commercial desires.

67
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,905
So the second thing you can do is you can do everything.

68
00:03:33,527 --> 00:03:36,748
So you can register a brand and brand Twitter,

69
00:03:36,828 --> 00:03:38,629
Instagram, Tumblr, website, big cartel,

70
00:03:38,689 --> 00:03:41,251
Twitch channel, Discord channel, TIG source thread,

71
00:03:41,271 --> 00:03:43,712
you can create a mailing list and write in-depth content

72
00:03:44,192 --> 00:03:46,354
for it that's bi-weekly, that's syndicated on the blog,

73
00:03:46,394 --> 00:03:48,034
you should probably do some screenshots, maybe like.

74
00:03:48,455 --> 00:03:52,816
pick some fan art, blah, blah, blah, send press releases and coordinate assets for these

75
00:03:52,936 --> 00:03:55,536
big announcements months and months and months in advance.

76
00:03:56,257 --> 00:04:00,057
You should feed the press a do distribute link at every chance you get so by the end

77
00:04:00,097 --> 00:04:04,078
of your development cycle you have this huge list of people who already want to play your

78
00:04:04,098 --> 00:04:04,318
game.

79
00:04:04,818 --> 00:04:08,159
You should go to every single network, every single event.

80
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:13,881
This includes PAX West, PAX South, PAX East, Indicate, Indicate East, E3, GDC and all the

81
00:04:13,921 --> 00:04:15,141
stuff in Europe I don't know about.

82
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:17,882
You need to network, you need to push the brand,

83
00:04:18,262 --> 00:04:20,602
you need to get feedback, you need to do GIFs,

84
00:04:20,682 --> 00:04:22,403
like tons and tons of GIFs.

85
00:04:23,283 --> 00:04:25,584
You need to do also a podcast with your staff

86
00:04:25,644 --> 00:04:28,364
and have developer guests and you talk and talk and talk.

87
00:04:29,005 --> 00:04:31,085
Whoa, okay.

88
00:04:31,685 --> 00:04:33,986
You need to be making a video game, okay?

89
00:04:34,446 --> 00:04:35,306
That's hard enough.

90
00:04:36,547 --> 00:04:38,827
And you totally can't do all of this.

91
00:04:40,436 --> 00:04:43,239
So it's time to kind of realign yourself,

92
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,581
using my idol, Patrick Swayze.

93
00:04:47,042 --> 00:04:50,105
How do you waste as little time, effort, money as possible

94
00:04:50,906 --> 00:04:52,227
with this huge checklist?

95
00:04:53,308 --> 00:04:55,450
The first thing you could do is pass it off to someone else.

96
00:04:55,991 --> 00:04:58,333
You could hire a marketing and PR person.

97
00:04:59,013 --> 00:05:01,676
You could hire me or one of the other great individuals

98
00:05:01,736 --> 00:05:02,837
who do marketing and PR.

99
00:05:02,877 --> 00:05:03,958
You could have a publisher.

100
00:05:05,756 --> 00:05:07,636
But that's not what this talk is really about.

101
00:05:07,656 --> 00:05:10,357
This talk is about you doing it.

102
00:05:12,358 --> 00:05:15,158
Game developers are some of the most creative,

103
00:05:15,438 --> 00:05:18,379
most intelligent, hardworking individuals I've ever met.

104
00:05:19,439 --> 00:05:20,580
And they say to me a lot,

105
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:23,260
well I can't think about marketing and PR,

106
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:24,280
that's something you do.

107
00:05:25,561 --> 00:05:27,621
And I definitely believe that you can do it

108
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:28,741
on your own without me.

109
00:05:29,502 --> 00:05:31,482
So I'm trying to put myself out of a job, basically.

110
00:05:33,486 --> 00:05:38,009
So the first part of what I do is I immerse myself in a video game.

111
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,452
For a developer, this means you have to get out of your own way

112
00:05:41,572 --> 00:05:43,734
and get out of a developer mentality.

113
00:05:44,834 --> 00:05:47,717
This is kind of weird, but first thing is, like,

114
00:05:47,797 --> 00:05:50,099
kind of immerse yourself in all the things that you did

115
00:05:50,119 --> 00:05:51,520
when you first started making the game.

116
00:05:51,980 --> 00:05:55,223
Look at old design docs, prototypes, notes,

117
00:05:55,903 --> 00:05:57,905
you know, just basically go through your Google Drive.

118
00:05:58,365 --> 00:06:00,667
Have someone interview you about your game.

119
00:06:01,247 --> 00:06:04,309
you'll find, but make sure they're like somebody outside of the industry.

120
00:06:04,729 --> 00:06:06,890
They'll probably ask you a lot of interesting questions like,

121
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:08,811
oh, where did this game come from?

122
00:06:08,991 --> 00:06:11,032
Or why did you make this game?

123
00:06:11,672 --> 00:06:14,994
And basically from that, a lot of interesting nuggets

124
00:06:15,014 --> 00:06:16,915
will come out that you don't immediately

125
00:06:16,975 --> 00:06:20,396
think of as a developer who's working on your game every single day.

126
00:06:23,011 --> 00:06:28,535
Yeah, this is weird, but you should read some video game forums, maybe like NeoGAF or something.

127
00:06:29,015 --> 00:06:32,498
Read the comments, which kind of sucks, but you should.

128
00:06:32,958 --> 00:06:38,042
You should kind of see what everybody's saying about your game or anything around your game.

129
00:06:38,342 --> 00:06:39,363
Go to GameStop.

130
00:06:39,743 --> 00:06:45,147
I don't know, like just go hear what consumers are talking about and how they view games.

131
00:06:45,588 --> 00:06:49,390
Because a lot of times developers start to forget as you're in the middle of a very,

132
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:50,711
very heavy development cycle.

133
00:06:51,748 --> 00:06:52,969
Throw out your assumptions.

134
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:57,171
I know you really, really think that

135
00:06:57,231 --> 00:06:59,693
that procedurally generated terrain

136
00:06:59,753 --> 00:07:02,395
that you spent weeks and weeks and weeks on

137
00:07:02,515 --> 00:07:03,536
is really, really cool,

138
00:07:04,376 --> 00:07:07,018
but it might not be so cool to the consumer.

139
00:07:07,038 --> 00:07:09,680
So you have to kind of divide yourself

140
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:11,461
from these things that you've put your blood,

141
00:07:12,281 --> 00:07:13,422
sweat, and tears into,

142
00:07:13,922 --> 00:07:15,143
and kind of throw out your assumptions.

143
00:07:17,033 --> 00:07:20,919
So the chunk of what I do when I start a project

144
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:24,044
is kind of this understanding phase.

145
00:07:25,045 --> 00:07:26,928
And this is basically arming yourself

146
00:07:27,589 --> 00:07:29,432
with a ton of information

147
00:07:30,654 --> 00:07:32,256
that you just aren't thinking about.

148
00:07:33,817 --> 00:07:36,678
The first thing is a visual and verbal brand analysis.

149
00:07:37,519 --> 00:07:39,520
This is a really fancy way of talking about

150
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:41,560
putting all your cards on the table.

151
00:07:42,381 --> 00:07:46,442
This is basically looking at every single node of press,

152
00:07:47,303 --> 00:07:48,763
your own personal marketing,

153
00:07:48,783 --> 00:07:50,644
it could be copy from your Steam page,

154
00:07:51,625 --> 00:07:52,965
it could be tweets that you sent,

155
00:07:53,025 --> 00:07:54,926
it could be something on your blog.

156
00:07:55,586 --> 00:07:58,187
All this stuff kind of creates

157
00:07:58,247 --> 00:08:00,008
a visual and verbal brand image.

158
00:08:00,995 --> 00:08:03,758
So here's an example of a really simple one I did for Thumper.

159
00:08:04,699 --> 00:08:08,523
We kind of looked at the key visuals and some screenshots

160
00:08:09,324 --> 00:08:10,785
and the copy that they were using.

161
00:08:12,107 --> 00:08:15,870
As you can see, Thumper is like a super angry looking game.

162
00:08:16,391 --> 00:08:19,174
So when we were kind of talking about the social media

163
00:08:19,214 --> 00:08:21,316
voice for launch, we kind of thought

164
00:08:21,516 --> 00:08:24,259
it might be fun to have kind of an edgy.

165
00:08:26,079 --> 00:08:28,783
voice or tone that kind of fit with the brand.

166
00:08:29,644 --> 00:08:31,566
So, you know, we were doing stuff like saying,

167
00:08:31,887 --> 00:08:35,171
hey, we've gotten some reports that people's thumbs are bleeding from Thumper.

168
00:08:35,632 --> 00:08:36,192
Too bad.

169
00:08:36,212 --> 00:08:41,920
And it kind of came from a lot of this kind of copy that was already written and this brand image.

170
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:47,064
For M++, I kind of was, this is for their Steam launch.

171
00:08:47,925 --> 00:08:50,605
M++ was a game that launched on PS4 previously,

172
00:08:51,126 --> 00:08:52,606
and then later came to Steam.

173
00:08:53,546 --> 00:08:55,447
I kind of looked at their visual identity

174
00:08:55,587 --> 00:08:56,847
and what they were putting out there.

175
00:08:57,848 --> 00:08:58,768
And also their verbal.

176
00:08:59,108 --> 00:09:00,548
And basically what we found was,

177
00:09:01,188 --> 00:09:04,749
in every single point of, you know, blogs, copy,

178
00:09:05,650 --> 00:09:07,971
We were talking about the game in different ways.

179
00:09:08,711 --> 00:09:11,072
So we were wondering if people could really

180
00:09:11,132 --> 00:09:13,073
like kind of grasp what the game was about.

181
00:09:13,494 --> 00:09:15,294
So we knew that we had to kind of come up

182
00:09:15,334 --> 00:09:18,416
with a new consistent verbal identity.

183
00:09:18,896 --> 00:09:20,697
So it was kind of a really helpful exercise

184
00:09:20,737 --> 00:09:22,858
to pick apart every single part

185
00:09:23,058 --> 00:09:24,879
of M++'s verbal identity.

186
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:28,961
The next part is a competitive audit.

187
00:09:29,782 --> 00:09:30,842
I don't know if that's spelled right.

188
00:09:32,343 --> 00:09:32,643
Oh well.

189
00:09:33,343 --> 00:09:33,463
But.

190
00:09:34,793 --> 00:09:37,895
This is going to feel weird, but it's totally okay.

191
00:09:37,955 --> 00:09:38,355
Trust me.

192
00:09:39,136 --> 00:09:41,677
So your competitors are a lot of times your friends,

193
00:09:41,717 --> 00:09:43,598
your colleagues, people you respect.

194
00:09:44,719 --> 00:09:47,280
It's totally okay to look at them as competitors,

195
00:09:49,321 --> 00:09:49,821
and it's weird.

196
00:09:51,294 --> 00:09:54,435
But so basically what I do is kind of like take objectives.

197
00:09:54,895 --> 00:09:57,156
So in this case for Gone Home for consoles,

198
00:09:57,796 --> 00:09:59,837
we were looking at a sub-brand strategy.

199
00:10:00,057 --> 00:10:05,700
And a sub-brand is kind of a secondary descriptor for a game.

200
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:09,741
So for Gone Home, we finally landed on console edition.

201
00:10:10,796 --> 00:10:11,756
for the console version.

202
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:14,839
But we kind of did an analysis of all these different

203
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:18,502
competitors, which were indie games that had previously

204
00:10:18,562 --> 00:10:20,804
released on Steam that went to PS4.

205
00:10:21,504 --> 00:10:23,846
It's a very simple exercise, but it was extremely helpful

206
00:10:23,906 --> 00:10:28,570
in understanding how consumers and how developers see games

207
00:10:28,670 --> 00:10:29,611
as they're re-released.

208
00:10:30,612 --> 00:10:34,355
For Thumper, we kind of looked at Ryan, your game, Crypt of

209
00:10:34,375 --> 00:10:37,517
the Necromancer, and a bunch of other VR games, because we

210
00:10:37,557 --> 00:10:39,359
wanted to kind of see how people were seeing the

211
00:10:41,156 --> 00:10:42,657
the music genre.

212
00:10:43,658 --> 00:10:46,059
And obviously, Thumper is a thing of its own,

213
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,201
but it was still really helpful to understand

214
00:10:49,361 --> 00:10:51,222
what had released and what was coming out.

215
00:10:52,383 --> 00:10:53,244
And then for M++, we did a

216
00:10:56,168 --> 00:11:03,173
three-fold thing. We were looking at what kind of genres that M++ could fall into, so platformers, time attack,

217
00:11:03,613 --> 00:11:04,654
minimalist graphics.

218
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:10,277
We were looking at different prices, and by looking at the competitive set, we got a good idea of

219
00:11:11,038 --> 00:11:13,299
where we were going to be stacking on the Steam version.

220
00:11:15,429 --> 00:11:17,710
So the next thing I do is a SWAT.

221
00:11:19,271 --> 00:11:20,872
And it's not Keanu Reeves from Speed,

222
00:11:20,932 --> 00:11:22,874
though that's an awesome movie as well.

223
00:11:22,994 --> 00:11:25,595
Strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.

224
00:11:26,716 --> 00:11:32,299
This is a basic exercise that I use to kind of just basically

225
00:11:32,419 --> 00:11:35,761
analyze a game from a marketing point of view.

226
00:11:36,101 --> 00:11:41,365
So this isn't really a gameplay or design exercise so much

227
00:11:41,445 --> 00:11:41,845
as it is.

228
00:11:42,685 --> 00:11:45,087
thinking of like, as Adam Saltzman has talked about,

229
00:11:45,488 --> 00:11:46,829
kind of this tip of the iceberg

230
00:11:46,889 --> 00:11:48,890
that only consumers see of your game.

231
00:11:49,330 --> 00:11:51,412
That little tip of the iceberg that they see,

232
00:11:52,093 --> 00:11:55,155
how do you identify what each of these things are?

233
00:11:56,136 --> 00:12:00,519
So I felt a little uncomfortable sharing me

234
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:02,761
ripping apart a bunch of other games.

235
00:12:03,261 --> 00:12:05,283
So I'm gonna use Bubsy as an example.

236
00:12:05,303 --> 00:12:07,965
I don't know why you're laughing.

237
00:12:08,688 --> 00:12:09,488
It's such a good game.

238
00:12:09,808 --> 00:12:11,408
So yeah, so strengths.

239
00:12:11,968 --> 00:12:14,009
Bubsy has flight exploration.

240
00:12:14,389 --> 00:12:16,989
This is something that was completely pretty much

241
00:12:17,069 --> 00:12:20,510
unseen in the platformer genre as of May 1993.

242
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:26,171
This was a competitive difference between Mario and Sonic.

243
00:12:27,432 --> 00:12:29,152
Attitude and voice acting.

244
00:12:29,792 --> 00:12:31,472
Mario and Sonic were both silent.

245
00:12:31,912 --> 00:12:33,693
Bubsy had awesome one-liners.

246
00:12:34,805 --> 00:12:38,757
world building. There was like a really weird alien world where they were stealing all the

247
00:12:38,797 --> 00:12:42,527
yarn and Bubsy was a bobcat and there's all this weird stuff. It was cool.

248
00:12:43,622 --> 00:12:45,624
And there was a multitude of death animations.

249
00:12:46,545 --> 00:12:50,028
This may seem super lame and weird for us in 2017,

250
00:12:51,149 --> 00:12:53,571
but back in 1993, I could totally see that

251
00:12:54,092 --> 00:12:54,953
on the back of the box.

252
00:12:56,394 --> 00:12:59,017
Weaknesses was the game was really floaty

253
00:12:59,657 --> 00:13:02,800
and unpredictably hard, and kind of bad sometimes,

254
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:03,661
but whatever.

255
00:13:05,383 --> 00:13:07,464
And we were kind of like living in a post-Sonic world,

256
00:13:07,504 --> 00:13:10,225
so you kind of think that people are gonna make

257
00:13:10,245 --> 00:13:12,706
these brand associations between Bubsy and Sonic

258
00:13:13,246 --> 00:13:14,226
and direct comparisons.

259
00:13:15,787 --> 00:13:19,108
Opportunities, though, it was on the SNES first only.

260
00:13:21,309 --> 00:13:23,309
You think of like all these kids that are buying Mario

261
00:13:23,349 --> 00:13:25,090
and they go to their friend's house at the Genesis,

262
00:13:25,490 --> 00:13:26,950
they see Sonic, they can't get it

263
00:13:26,970 --> 00:13:28,791
because they only have SNES.

264
00:13:29,791 --> 00:13:33,873
It's kind of like it fills a gap in the marketplace.

265
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:37,553
And there was also a release gap during the time that Bubsy came out.

266
00:13:38,313 --> 00:13:42,337
I don't know, some other game like Day of the Tentacle or something came out around them.

267
00:13:42,457 --> 00:13:44,298
I don't know.

268
00:13:45,299 --> 00:13:45,619
Threats.

269
00:13:46,460 --> 00:13:54,647
So yeah, on the flip side though, it could be seen as just like this kind of Sonic rip-off on SNES, which might be a detractor.

270
00:13:55,447 --> 00:13:57,609
And also Sonic CD was coming out later in the year.

271
00:13:58,695 --> 00:14:01,596
So it's just a really simple exercise

272
00:14:01,636 --> 00:14:05,639
of compartmentalizing different ways of looking

273
00:14:05,679 --> 00:14:07,039
at a game from the outside.

274
00:14:08,820 --> 00:14:10,601
So we come back to this list.

275
00:14:11,781 --> 00:14:15,664
And it's still really ridiculous and seems like a lot of stuff.

276
00:14:16,424 --> 00:14:19,046
But now, instead of just crossing off everything,

277
00:14:19,486 --> 00:14:21,948
we just cross off some of the things that we don't feel

278
00:14:21,988 --> 00:14:22,968
are right for our game.

279
00:14:23,649 --> 00:14:25,330
After we've looked at our competitive set

280
00:14:25,350 --> 00:14:27,031
and we kind of understand what they're doing,

281
00:14:27,571 --> 00:14:29,733
after we've kind of understood our consumers

282
00:14:29,933 --> 00:14:30,833
and what they need.

283
00:14:32,074 --> 00:14:34,556
And you can kind of eliminate a lot of these things

284
00:14:35,076 --> 00:14:38,638
so that you have the actual mental and emotional bandwidth

285
00:14:38,739 --> 00:14:41,280
to do it yourself without hiring me.

286
00:14:42,889 --> 00:14:46,331
So like some results of this are things like this.

287
00:14:46,831 --> 00:14:48,372
So like for the Knight in the Woods team,

288
00:14:48,392 --> 00:14:50,312
they identified that their characters

289
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:53,674
were probably some of the most memorable of all time.

290
00:14:53,694 --> 00:14:56,295
So they created a May plushie,

291
00:14:56,355 --> 00:14:57,576
which is gonna be sold out

292
00:14:57,736 --> 00:15:00,197
for the foreseeable future and forever.

293
00:15:01,226 --> 00:15:09,132
For Overland, we created a first access program that basically enlisted players to buy Overland early on itch.io

294
00:15:09,813 --> 00:15:13,575
and get involved with the forums and have extra content.

295
00:15:14,196 --> 00:15:19,680
But we branded it and marketed it in such a way that it engages people to the brand strengths.

296
00:15:20,701 --> 00:15:24,444
For Brigador, they identified that they had a really cool world,

297
00:15:25,004 --> 00:15:30,748
so they actually had a novel written and then an audio novel made from that novel.

298
00:15:31,899 --> 00:15:35,822
For Thimbleweed Park, Ron Gilbert has an incredible following,

299
00:15:36,462 --> 00:15:40,485
so he decided that a development blog was a really good outlet.

300
00:15:40,585 --> 00:15:46,349
And he's kept up that development blog since their Kickstarter launch years ago.

301
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:49,191
Then for Gone Home for console edition,

302
00:15:49,692 --> 00:15:53,034
we were kind of thinking of interesting ways to pitch it to the press.

303
00:15:54,375 --> 00:15:57,097
And what do you do with a game that's been out for three years?

304
00:15:59,410 --> 00:16:06,932
It was mostly Steve, but we pitched basically the first ever Cheevo on Gone Home and then

305
00:16:06,992 --> 00:16:10,334
had him do a speed run in office at IGN.

306
00:16:11,274 --> 00:16:16,976
And these are all things that kind of I think really only come from an exercise like basically

307
00:16:17,016 --> 00:16:20,477
looking at your competitive set and looking at your game in a different way.

308
00:16:22,662 --> 00:16:25,964
So yeah, so basically, to recap, you immerse yourself

309
00:16:26,465 --> 00:16:29,888
and kind of prepare yourself to get out of development mode

310
00:16:29,928 --> 00:16:33,250
and get into this weird psychological marketing mode.

311
00:16:34,051 --> 00:16:36,693
Two, you understand your game objectively.

312
00:16:37,134 --> 00:16:39,315
So you start to learn ways to look at your game

313
00:16:39,896 --> 00:16:41,577
without a kind of bias.

314
00:16:42,498 --> 00:16:44,680
And three, you execute on what makes sense

315
00:16:45,541 --> 00:16:47,402
and what you have budget for.

316
00:16:47,422 --> 00:16:49,424
And that's really it.

317
00:16:50,654 --> 00:16:52,675
And if you're interested in talking to me ever

318
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,375
about marketing or PR or whatever, that's my Twitter.

319
00:16:54,395 --> 00:16:55,115
Thanks.

320
00:16:55,135 --> 00:16:55,315
Thank you.

321
00:16:55,335 --> 00:16:55,576
Thank you.

322
00:16:55,596 --> 00:16:57,676
Thank you.

323
00:16:57,696 --> 00:17:08,739
You wanna go to the mic?

324
00:17:08,759 --> 00:17:08,800
Oh.

325
00:17:08,820 --> 00:17:10,040
If anybody has any questions,

326
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:13,461
feel free to come up to the mic, in the middle.

327
00:17:17,082 --> 00:17:17,622
Any questions?

328
00:17:17,762 --> 00:17:19,783
Anybody want me to do their marketing plan on the spot?

329
00:17:22,606 --> 00:17:24,426
That's fine, I'll do it.

330
00:17:25,727 --> 00:17:27,507
Hey, my name is Odette Chiron.

331
00:17:27,527 --> 00:17:30,628
I'm speaking on a similar topic on Thursday at 3 PM,

332
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:33,569
ultra low budget indie game developer.

333
00:17:33,849 --> 00:17:35,369
So this is my shameless plug.

334
00:17:35,809 --> 00:17:38,870
And there's a roundtable about low budget indie game

335
00:17:38,910 --> 00:17:40,131
development and marketing.

336
00:17:40,171 --> 00:17:43,011
I'll be happy if you'll join us and speak with other developers

337
00:17:43,051 --> 00:17:43,391
about this.

338
00:17:44,272 --> 00:17:44,652
Would I?

339
00:17:44,972 --> 00:17:46,012
Yeah.

340
00:17:46,032 --> 00:17:46,792
Thursday at 3?

341
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:47,613
4 PM, yeah.

342
00:17:47,833 --> 00:17:48,533
Yeah, probably.

343
00:17:48,553 --> 00:17:49,213
Yeah, I think so.

344
00:17:49,653 --> 00:17:50,333
Cool, thanks.

345
00:17:53,647 --> 00:17:53,967
Hello.

346
00:17:54,847 --> 00:17:56,989
A lot of your talk was about console or PC.

347
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,210
Do you have any tips on mobile marketing?

348
00:17:59,751 --> 00:17:59,911
No.

349
00:18:00,271 --> 00:18:01,672
I'm sorry.

350
00:18:03,673 --> 00:18:06,715
Like, I just don't touch mobile.

351
00:18:07,496 --> 00:18:12,859
So this is the thing that I want to also kind of leave with you

352
00:18:12,919 --> 00:18:17,622
is that I was marketing for baby therapeutics eczema creams.

353
00:18:18,323 --> 00:18:21,144
and for tampons, and now I'm marketing

354
00:18:21,264 --> 00:18:22,705
for independent video games.

355
00:18:22,765 --> 00:18:24,805
I use the same exact theorems, and they

356
00:18:24,845 --> 00:18:26,046
seem to be working so far.

357
00:18:26,486 --> 00:18:28,527
So I think there's intricacies you

358
00:18:28,547 --> 00:18:30,307
need to learn about each marketplace.

359
00:18:31,028 --> 00:18:32,668
But if you follow a similar template,

360
00:18:32,748 --> 00:18:36,210
I think that you'll be OK with the same path.

361
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:37,490
Thanks.

362
00:18:37,870 --> 00:18:37,990
Yeah.

363
00:18:40,071 --> 00:18:40,371
Hi there.

364
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:40,811
Hi.

365
00:18:42,769 --> 00:18:50,293
I feel like in the current indie scene, a lot of times the hook or the unique selling proposition is sometimes just seen as a crutch.

366
00:18:50,974 --> 00:18:54,015
Especially if you're using low budget graphics or inexpensive graphics.

367
00:18:54,516 --> 00:19:00,159
Do you have any ideas on how to gap that hurdle?

368
00:19:00,859 --> 00:19:03,341
Get what hurdle? The USP?

369
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:08,924
Well, specifically, the USP is often seen as a crutch.

370
00:19:11,335 --> 00:19:13,356
instead of a hook or something unique, it's like,

371
00:19:13,656 --> 00:19:16,217
oh, I get it, it's this plus this or whatever,

372
00:19:16,237 --> 00:19:18,558
as opposed to something that's,

373
00:19:20,239 --> 00:19:23,221
maybe has unique gameplay

374
00:19:23,401 --> 00:19:24,942
or a unique experience for the player.

375
00:19:25,582 --> 00:19:27,523
So I think like a helpful exercise,

376
00:19:28,303 --> 00:19:30,224
and I think the question is,

377
00:19:30,384 --> 00:19:32,906
he's asking about like a unique selling proposition,

378
00:19:33,466 --> 00:19:35,127
and I think, as I understand it,

379
00:19:35,167 --> 00:19:36,628
like kind of talking about a game,

380
00:19:36,868 --> 00:19:38,028
comparing it to other games,

381
00:19:38,088 --> 00:19:40,350
and how do you get like a one-liner that's effective?

382
00:19:41,515 --> 00:19:46,516
And I think like a one-liner is really effective for when you're talking to the press or you're talking to other developers

383
00:19:47,576 --> 00:19:50,917
Or you are just you know somehow getting your message to consumers

384
00:19:51,797 --> 00:19:57,958
But you wanted to feel like the thing that you're saying so maybe your game is a mixture of

385
00:19:58,318 --> 00:20:00,659
Final Fantasy tactics and

386
00:20:01,379 --> 00:20:08,680
Like Kirby, but you don't say that you want to get that feeling so I would kind of like take each of those elements of

387
00:20:09,361 --> 00:20:13,647
your like fake one liner and then kind of look at the elements from that and look at

388
00:20:13,707 --> 00:20:18,494
how you can make it a unique spin on your own. I don't know if that answers the question

389
00:20:18,514 --> 00:20:23,441
but. Cool, thank you. Yep. Hi, so you talked about, um,

390
00:20:24,180 --> 00:20:27,622
marketing the game really early in the process.

391
00:20:27,943 --> 00:20:30,825
But for example, I just have now the game as like

392
00:20:31,105 --> 00:20:33,067
the world generation character movement

393
00:20:33,167 --> 00:20:36,309
and not much going to the AI and all of that.

394
00:20:36,349 --> 00:20:39,932
So to me it feels like, is it too early now

395
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:42,794
to promote my game when there's not much

396
00:20:42,874 --> 00:20:44,195
to show in the first place?

397
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:49,145
So the question is about marketing your game early

398
00:20:49,345 --> 00:20:51,646
and if there is a point where it's

399
00:20:51,706 --> 00:20:53,187
too early to promote your game.

400
00:20:54,008 --> 00:20:56,589
I think that there's a difference between marketing

401
00:20:56,849 --> 00:20:58,170
and promotion or PR.

402
00:20:59,471 --> 00:21:02,412
And you don't want to be promoting your game too early,

403
00:21:02,913 --> 00:21:04,273
but you do want to be doing marketing.

404
00:21:04,313 --> 00:21:06,755
So marketing is a lot of the brand thinking

405
00:21:07,215 --> 00:21:09,116
and core principles behind everything

406
00:21:09,136 --> 00:21:12,118
that you're going to push later on through your promotion.

407
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,243
PR, there could be an entire talk on basically PR timing and promotion timing.

408
00:21:18,744 --> 00:21:25,308
It's incredibly critical in when you email press, like are you emailing them one day

409
00:21:25,368 --> 00:21:26,229
before the conference?

410
00:21:26,269 --> 00:21:28,851
Are you emailing them four days before the conference?

411
00:21:29,291 --> 00:21:31,713
When are you giving them assets and review copies?

412
00:21:32,653 --> 00:21:33,454
So I think like...

413
00:21:34,194 --> 00:21:36,916
you shouldn't be promoting your game when you're just starting out.

414
00:21:37,737 --> 00:21:43,580
And I think it's a little addicting right now for developers to share everything that they do.

415
00:21:44,081 --> 00:21:45,201
And that's totally okay.

416
00:21:45,642 --> 00:21:48,544
And it's like one principle of promotion, which is like,

417
00:21:48,904 --> 00:21:51,566
hey, I made this prototype, I made the prototype again.

418
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:54,827
the prototype has better graphics, look at the physics

419
00:21:54,907 --> 00:21:58,789
engine now. And I'm not as big of a fan as that kind of

420
00:21:58,869 --> 00:22:03,051
iterative approach as keeping it closer to your chest, but

421
00:22:03,111 --> 00:22:05,312
everybody has different preferences. So.

422
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:06,272
Alright, thank you.

423
00:22:09,113 --> 00:22:10,654
Hi, how's it going? I'm Posse.

424
00:22:11,234 --> 00:22:12,655
It's kind of okay.

425
00:22:14,873 --> 00:22:21,317
I wanted to ask about leveraging the development team for marketing and PR purposes.

426
00:22:22,457 --> 00:22:29,540
Usually when you do not have any special marketing resources, you kind of have to work with the team to create stuff,

427
00:22:30,421 --> 00:22:32,962
and the teams tend to be somewhat negative.

428
00:22:33,794 --> 00:22:35,094
towards marketing and PR.

429
00:22:36,415 --> 00:22:39,336
Have you found any good ways of leveraging like

430
00:22:40,076 --> 00:22:46,960
existing activities and like going with the flow, trying to find a way to work with the team that's

431
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:51,882
natural to the development team to kind of for marketing ends?

432
00:22:53,999 --> 00:22:59,463
The question was basically how do you motivate a design team to approach marketing and PR.

433
00:22:59,844 --> 00:23:02,846
I feel like it was kind of lobbed because Ryan and I were just talking about this right

434
00:23:02,866 --> 00:23:03,226
before.

435
00:23:03,266 --> 00:23:04,528
Maybe it's like a plant or something.

436
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:08,811
But basically, it's a design problem.

437
00:23:08,911 --> 00:23:11,333
Marketing and PR is a game design problem.

438
00:23:12,463 --> 00:23:14,604
You are, you kind of have your objective,

439
00:23:14,704 --> 00:23:17,145
which is getting the player to the game,

440
00:23:17,806 --> 00:23:19,086
and you kind of have to figure out

441
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:20,827
how to veer them in the right way.

442
00:23:20,887 --> 00:23:22,628
So if you kind of approach it the same way

443
00:23:22,668 --> 00:23:24,549
you would approach any other design problem,

444
00:23:25,490 --> 00:23:28,291
I think you can motivate your team to do this.

445
00:23:29,732 --> 00:23:31,053
Furthermore, like I think that like,

446
00:23:31,891 --> 00:23:33,412
it's mostly a mental game,

447
00:23:33,472 --> 00:23:34,933
and that's kind of what this presentation

448
00:23:34,973 --> 00:23:36,193
was hopefully a little bit about,

449
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,754
is getting yourself out of the mentality

450
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:43,397
that marketing is this super scary professional thing.

451
00:23:43,877 --> 00:23:45,638
Because if I can do it,

452
00:23:46,178 --> 00:23:48,079
all you people who are so much smarter than me

453
00:23:48,119 --> 00:23:49,080
can definitely do it.

454
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,941
So I think it's about framing,

455
00:23:52,722 --> 00:23:53,502
is kind of the answer.

456
00:23:54,362 --> 00:23:54,923
Cool, thanks.

457
00:23:58,727 --> 00:24:07,129
Hello. So my question is for the case of the one man shop type of situations for the complete

458
00:24:07,509 --> 00:24:16,332
single man indie game case. Do you have any tips around how much you PR and market for

459
00:24:16,392 --> 00:24:18,973
the game versus the person as a brand itself?

460
00:24:21,657 --> 00:24:24,882
The question was basically about like a one person development team.

461
00:24:25,684 --> 00:24:30,452
How much do you balance basically marketing the game and marketing the developer themselves?

462
00:24:31,474 --> 00:24:32,876
It's a really tricky question.

463
00:24:33,812 --> 00:24:39,593
Really tricky question and basically I don't think anything can be templated out and copy

464
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:45,015
and pasted from any game. So if you look at something like Stardew Valley with Concerned

465
00:24:45,095 --> 00:24:50,617
Ape, I don't remember his name at the time, but basically that's kind of a success story

466
00:24:50,677 --> 00:24:54,718
right with one developer who yes they were published but they made that game all on their

467
00:24:54,798 --> 00:24:55,478
own and they are at.

468
00:24:56,059 --> 00:25:01,364
the figurehead. It doesn't always work for every single game that has one developer.

469
00:25:02,285 --> 00:25:05,988
So it's kind of, you kind of need to look at different examples and maybe even look

470
00:25:06,028 --> 00:25:13,615
at things that have failed. Look for games that have had one developer teams that it's

471
00:25:13,635 --> 00:25:18,359
just not that, like when you look at it, it's not that interesting to you that they're talking

472
00:25:18,379 --> 00:25:19,100
about themselves.

473
00:25:20,765 --> 00:25:23,067
I think that's probably a good place to start.

474
00:25:23,987 --> 00:25:26,468
And then you can kind of do some soul searching, so to speak,

475
00:25:26,528 --> 00:25:30,570
and kind of evaluate your own personal brand

476
00:25:31,131 --> 00:25:34,672
and figure out whether that's right to be the thing

477
00:25:34,692 --> 00:25:35,373
that you're marketing.

478
00:25:36,553 --> 00:25:36,753
Thanks.

479
00:25:38,254 --> 00:25:40,475
Yeah, so I'm curious if you have any quick tips or thoughts

480
00:25:40,896 --> 00:25:43,517
on continuing to market your multiplayer indie game

481
00:25:43,717 --> 00:25:45,318
to kind of keep it growing after launch.

482
00:25:46,770 --> 00:25:51,093
So the question was, tips for marketing a multiplayer game

483
00:25:51,373 --> 00:25:52,053
after launch.

484
00:25:53,434 --> 00:25:57,517
I've never, I think, actually worked on a multiplayer game.

485
00:25:58,278 --> 00:26:01,760
I've worked on maybe 10 to 15, 20 games at this point,

486
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:03,281
but never a multiplayer game.

487
00:26:03,962 --> 00:26:05,423
But I have talked to some people about it.

488
00:26:06,303 --> 00:26:08,365
And I think that the multiplayer games that

489
00:26:08,445 --> 00:26:11,767
are really successful right now are utilizing

490
00:26:11,887 --> 00:26:13,328
content updates and drops.

491
00:26:15,221 --> 00:26:19,185
that are consistent, having a clear voice with your players,

492
00:26:19,866 --> 00:26:22,689
and a clear avenue for communication

493
00:26:23,330 --> 00:26:25,552
is definitely something that's really successful.

494
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:28,835
I think if you look at a competitive set,

495
00:26:28,895 --> 00:26:34,241
you look at people like Dota 2, but you look at games

496
00:26:34,281 --> 00:26:37,024
like Dota 2 or any of these big multiplayer games,

497
00:26:37,104 --> 00:26:37,805
you could probably take.

498
00:26:38,545 --> 00:26:41,888
that kind of mentality and pare it down for your own.

499
00:26:43,429 --> 00:26:46,091
So maybe if you have a big content update

500
00:26:46,111 --> 00:26:49,153
that you're planning, maybe you release different parts of it

501
00:26:49,393 --> 00:26:53,176
in drips rather than one big update, something like that.

502
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:53,897
Thanks.

503
00:26:54,057 --> 00:26:55,058
Let me know if you want to help out.

504
00:26:55,118 --> 00:26:56,159
I'm willing to play a game.

505
00:26:56,219 --> 00:26:56,799
Cool, thanks.

506
00:26:58,560 --> 00:26:59,221
Hey, man, how's it going?

507
00:27:00,322 --> 00:27:04,964
also. Still okay, I think. I guess a couple things. One, I

508
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:08,586
actually really love that vegan mayonnaise that you marketed.

509
00:27:08,986 --> 00:27:12,468
Super awesome. The what? The vegan mayonnaise. Yeah, so good.

510
00:27:12,548 --> 00:27:17,250
The vegan? Oh, was it mayonnaise? Yeah. Yeah. Um, no,

511
00:27:17,290 --> 00:27:18,991
that was, that was a weird project.

512
00:27:20,961 --> 00:27:25,886
Um, so my question is, uh, when marketing and doing PR, do you

513
00:27:25,966 --> 00:27:30,170
kind of do a dry run where you send it out to a smaller

514
00:27:30,190 --> 00:27:33,874
community or to just close friends or just, you know,

515
00:27:34,094 --> 00:27:38,659
throughout, or like, what are some, I guess, tips to better

516
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:42,223
leverage your marketing and get feedback? Any tips on that?

517
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:46,119
So I think the question is mostly about feedback

518
00:27:46,219 --> 00:27:50,582
in the early stages and how you utilize that feedback

519
00:27:50,642 --> 00:27:51,703
to market your game.

520
00:27:53,084 --> 00:27:56,546
I think with everything, it's such a lame response,

521
00:27:56,586 --> 00:28:00,029
but everything is so individual.

522
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:03,291
And nothing works for one developer

523
00:28:03,311 --> 00:28:04,512
that would work for another.

524
00:28:05,474 --> 00:28:10,136
I think you need to look at your kind of game and the kind of content you have and kind

525
00:28:10,156 --> 00:28:15,137
of do like a similar analysis that I'm kind of putting out here today and then kind of

526
00:28:15,197 --> 00:28:20,899
evaluate whether the feedback that you would get, like, it depends also if your game is

527
00:28:20,939 --> 00:28:22,020
announced or not, right?

528
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:28,982
Like, maybe you, you, like, have some weird kind of, like, ambiguous marketing thing and

529
00:28:29,682 --> 00:28:32,183
sorry I didn't catch your name but I'm just gonna, what's your name?

530
00:28:32,743 --> 00:28:33,423
My name is Ryan.

531
00:28:33,815 --> 00:28:34,096
Ryan.

532
00:28:34,776 --> 00:28:36,618
So like, your friend might be like,

533
00:28:37,438 --> 00:28:39,560
hey I just tried Ryan's new prototype,

534
00:28:40,020 --> 00:28:42,222
and boy oh boy is that crazy.

535
00:28:42,482 --> 00:28:43,944
Like that kind of thing, you know?

536
00:28:44,004 --> 00:28:46,826
Like, I don't know, it's a weird thing.

537
00:28:46,866 --> 00:28:48,888
I think you should be thinking about marketing always,

538
00:28:49,608 --> 00:28:52,310
and as I said, look at Adam and Ryan's talks

539
00:28:52,911 --> 00:28:55,213
to kind of evaluate what you're making

540
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:58,235
and whether it's a thing that is viable.

541
00:28:59,256 --> 00:29:00,577
That's probably the best at that stage.

542
00:29:01,298 --> 00:29:01,778
Cool, thank you.

543
00:29:02,078 --> 00:29:02,258
Thanks.

544
00:29:04,133 --> 00:29:04,974
Hey, I'm Martin.

545
00:29:05,134 --> 00:29:06,375
We have time for one more.

546
00:29:06,435 --> 00:29:08,115
All right, thanks for the talk.

547
00:29:08,916 --> 00:29:11,077
So I pushed my game on Greenlight just now,

548
00:29:11,137 --> 00:29:12,518
and let's not talk about Greenlight

549
00:29:12,538 --> 00:29:13,538
because that's a whole other thing.

550
00:29:14,079 --> 00:29:16,400
But I spent all of the nights before coming to GDC

551
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:17,440
working on a trailer.

552
00:29:18,101 --> 00:29:19,521
And I kind of want to know, what's

553
00:29:19,541 --> 00:29:20,402
your process for a trailer?

554
00:29:20,422 --> 00:29:22,843
Because doing that is damn hard and it's fucking important.

555
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,064
Wait, sorry, can you repeat?

556
00:29:25,104 --> 00:29:27,225
What's your process, or what's your thoughts on trailers?

557
00:29:27,445 --> 00:29:30,307
How do you go when it comes to coming up with a trailer

558
00:29:30,407 --> 00:29:31,087
concept or whatever?

559
00:29:32,560 --> 00:29:38,983
I think like the question is about trailers specifically and how you decide what should be in a

560
00:29:39,183 --> 00:29:39,844
content trailer

561
00:29:39,864 --> 00:29:49,649
So I was working on a game that was actually cancelled and then the publisher picked it back up

562
00:29:51,002 --> 00:29:53,383
So it kind of had this thing where people were really hyped

563
00:29:53,463 --> 00:29:56,364
for it, we announced it, we said we're like, you know,

564
00:29:56,404 --> 00:29:59,905
six months for release, and then it got canceled.

565
00:30:00,125 --> 00:30:03,566
So we basically were like, okay, this is done.

566
00:30:03,726 --> 00:30:04,846
Then it kind of resurged.

567
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:12,431
And we were like, okay, well, how do we reannounce this thing in a way that is interesting, that

568
00:30:12,451 --> 00:30:17,294
people won't feel betrayed again because they got excited for it the first time.

569
00:30:17,694 --> 00:30:20,876
So what we did with the trailer was we did a really personal message.

570
00:30:21,836 --> 00:30:26,939
We had the developer get on camera and speak directly to people and say this is definitely

571
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:27,440
happening.

572
00:30:27,800 --> 00:30:32,302
We gave them a definite release date at the time of the trailer and showed them some gameplay

573
00:30:32,342 --> 00:30:32,543
of it.

574
00:30:33,003 --> 00:30:33,243
And then.

575
00:30:34,084 --> 00:30:34,824
That was the trailer.

576
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:38,648
So I think like every trailer has very specific needs.

577
00:30:40,049 --> 00:30:42,391
And I would just say to everybody,

578
00:30:42,831 --> 00:30:45,694
for everything beyond trailers, always look inside.

579
00:30:45,714 --> 00:30:47,255
Sounds so corny.

580
00:30:47,295 --> 00:30:52,079
Look inside yourself and think about what your game needs

581
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:55,543
and then kind of tweak what you're going to do

582
00:30:56,303 --> 00:30:56,844
based on that.

583
00:30:56,864 --> 00:30:57,945
All right, thanks.

584
00:30:58,305 --> 00:30:58,545
Thank you.
