1
00:00:04,203 --> 00:00:06,945
Thanks. I hope you guys all enjoyed the tutorial today.

2
00:00:08,085 --> 00:00:10,987
I really liked some of the talks, even though it wasn't even full attention.

3
00:00:11,007 --> 00:00:11,968
They completely hit home.

4
00:00:12,848 --> 00:00:15,270
Actually, thank you for making the decision, sticking around,

5
00:00:15,290 --> 00:00:16,651
because that's what this talk is about.

6
00:00:17,591 --> 00:00:20,993
This photograph you've been looking at, which is my title slide,

7
00:00:21,354 --> 00:00:24,295
it's a photograph of three reed warbler eggs, which is a bird,

8
00:00:24,435 --> 00:00:25,296
and one cuckoo egg.

9
00:00:26,317 --> 00:00:30,619
And I find it intensely beautiful, but it's also not back to my past,

10
00:00:31,678 --> 00:00:36,982
Back in 1998, I was studying biology at the University of Essen, my hometown in Germany.

11
00:00:37,462 --> 00:00:41,785
And I realized I wasn't really into it anymore, because as much as I love biology, I like

12
00:00:41,865 --> 00:00:42,685
playing games more.

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,348
And I realized that what I was doing at night, which was to make Doom and Quake levels, and

14
00:00:47,388 --> 00:00:51,130
hanging out on IRC, talking to other people doing the same stuff, I realized I could actually

15
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:53,932
do that for a living, and I could become a professional game developer.

16
00:00:56,384 --> 00:01:00,408
I was already an accomplished level designer in that I'd been making quite a few Doom levels,

17
00:01:00,508 --> 00:01:06,415
which got pretty good attention, were included in some best-of list, and I contributed to

18
00:01:06,435 --> 00:01:10,880
what we called MegaWatts, which were these high-profile community map chests that we

19
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:14,904
would give out, and they were a complete 32-level replacement.

20
00:01:17,038 --> 00:01:19,260
And then I started making Quake levels as soon as it was released,

21
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:22,822
because just like everybody else, I was looking forward to Quake and I wanted to be ready.

22
00:01:23,283 --> 00:01:25,824
Which became my crowning amateur achievement, I guess.

23
00:01:25,864 --> 00:01:26,945
It was called Beyond Belief.

24
00:01:27,345 --> 00:01:31,248
It was a 9-level single-player replacement for Quake.

25
00:01:32,148 --> 00:01:34,270
And it got a lot of attention. It was featured on Blue's News,

26
00:01:34,330 --> 00:01:35,951
which was my crowning achievement back then.

27
00:01:36,371 --> 00:01:40,374
It got like 10,000 downloads in the first week, which was awesome back then.

28
00:01:42,248 --> 00:01:45,292
And to that I got my first job offer in the gaming industry at Ritual Entertainment

29
00:01:45,372 --> 00:01:48,456
because some of the people I knew from ILC championed my work there.

30
00:01:48,996 --> 00:01:54,463
So pretty much exactly 16 years to the day in March 1998, age 22,

31
00:01:55,064 --> 00:01:57,427
I found myself at the airport with a single suitcase.

32
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:02,322
making the decision to leave friends, family, and country behind

33
00:02:02,442 --> 00:02:05,024
because I was moving to Texas, Dallas, Texas.

34
00:02:05,545 --> 00:02:08,067
So since then I've worked as a level designer on quite a few games,

35
00:02:08,147 --> 00:02:09,908
and the last game I actually created levels for

36
00:02:09,968 --> 00:02:13,110
was in an official level design position, that is, was Dead Space 2.

37
00:02:13,851 --> 00:02:16,073
But I changed gears a little bit afterwards.

38
00:02:16,173 --> 00:02:18,214
I was the lead designer on Star Wars 1313,

39
00:02:18,495 --> 00:02:20,816
which unfortunately got canned right after last GDC

40
00:02:20,856 --> 00:02:22,838
because Disney doesn't like making stuff.

41
00:02:23,619 --> 00:02:23,799
And...

42
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:25,660
No.

43
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:30,077
It's all good, right? I'm actually the design director on an unannounced, I can't really talk about it,

44
00:02:30,137 --> 00:02:32,859
by a surely awesome project at 2K Games.

45
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:36,242
And initially this was kind of bothering me a little bit,

46
00:02:36,282 --> 00:02:39,164
because I was hitting this roadblock about what to talk about at this GDC,

47
00:02:39,184 --> 00:02:41,546
because I haven't shipped anything for three and a half years,

48
00:02:41,626 --> 00:02:43,407
and I didn't know exactly what I could talk about.

49
00:02:43,868 --> 00:02:46,670
But I realized that there's actually some overlap between the last game I worked on,

50
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:48,891
which was Dead Space 2, and what I'm doing right now,

51
00:02:48,911 --> 00:02:52,114
what I have been doing in the last couple of jobs,

52
00:02:52,174 --> 00:02:54,656
which is being in some sort of design leadership position.

53
00:02:54,916 --> 00:02:55,736
Because in those positions...

54
00:02:56,698 --> 00:02:59,000
I have to be able to explain what I like about games, right?

55
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:00,581
As a design director, I'd better be

56
00:03:00,621 --> 00:03:03,283
able to formalize some preferences about games

57
00:03:03,403 --> 00:03:05,305
into some sort of rules, because I

58
00:03:05,325 --> 00:03:07,087
want to be able to put that out there, discuss it

59
00:03:07,127 --> 00:03:08,908
with the design department, and so we

60
00:03:08,928 --> 00:03:11,190
can create some sort of shared design sensibility

61
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:12,211
for the entire project.

62
00:03:12,791 --> 00:03:14,833
And I realized that the closest I've ever actually

63
00:03:14,913 --> 00:03:16,534
come to doing this, at least publicly,

64
00:03:16,594 --> 00:03:19,357
was in 2012 right here at Level Design in a Day,

65
00:03:19,817 --> 00:03:22,199
because I did this talk called Player Stories and Designer

66
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,221
Stories, which was framed around Dead Space 2.

67
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:26,932
So in this talk, as a super quick recap,

68
00:03:27,092 --> 00:03:28,914
I explained my preference for the player story,

69
00:03:28,934 --> 00:03:30,476
because in my mind, that's the biggest

70
00:03:30,536 --> 00:03:32,939
way in which we use the medium specificity of games.

71
00:03:33,800 --> 00:03:36,142
And I proposed that strong player stories are found

72
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,684
in games which are rich in agency.

73
00:03:38,164 --> 00:03:39,185
So I talked about agency.

74
00:03:40,987 --> 00:03:48,055
explained how games actually afford agency in multiple areas, systemic, spatial, scheduling agency, and then went into exactly how

75
00:03:48,315 --> 00:03:52,279
systemic agency is the only one that's actually fundamental to games. The other two are optional,

76
00:03:52,339 --> 00:03:57,165
but we need to have good systemic agency to create really good gameplay for good gameplay experience.

77
00:03:58,032 --> 00:04:00,295
So, saying that this kind of game is still a great game, right?

78
00:04:00,655 --> 00:04:03,458
Even if it doesn't allow the player to choose multiple paths through the level

79
00:04:03,838 --> 00:04:06,741
or to customize the character, this can still be a great game.

80
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:10,745
Now, all of this was just in service of refuting one specific map

81
00:04:10,805 --> 00:04:12,828
that you see on the internet a lot, which is this one.

82
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:15,470
Because you often see this described,

83
00:04:16,151 --> 00:04:19,675
or to describe how modern first-person or third-person games are.

84
00:04:20,233 --> 00:04:25,395
crap, right? Oh my god, everything was better back then, and look at Doom back then, you could explore and now you can't do it.

85
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,277
And I was just pointing out that this is actually incredibly misleading because

86
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:32,338
a game like Dead Space 2, which might be on the right there,

87
00:04:32,598 --> 00:04:36,239
can be just as fun and afford just as much agency as Doom on the left there.

88
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:38,160
You just wouldn't be able to tell it from the map.

89
00:04:38,420 --> 00:04:42,522
And that's because the map doesn't actually express everything that's going on in the systemic agency.

90
00:04:43,544 --> 00:04:47,385
So that then manifested itself in this little comparison chart in the end.

91
00:04:47,405 --> 00:04:51,627
And we're saying, you know what, both Doom and Dead Space actually afford the same amount of systemic agency.

92
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:56,809
They're quite similar in the complexity of the low-level gameplay interactions that they create.

93
00:04:56,869 --> 00:04:57,949
So they're both as much fun.

94
00:04:59,089 --> 00:05:06,032
And then I said that this map needs to die, because, you know, linear levels can still create a sense of really strong personal player stories.

95
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:09,313
So that was in 2012, bringing me back to today.

96
00:05:10,526 --> 00:05:11,486
And a problem I have.

97
00:05:12,246 --> 00:05:13,907
I like this talk I did in 2012.

98
00:05:14,327 --> 00:05:15,727
I think it was actually really good.

99
00:05:15,747 --> 00:05:18,388
It just hasn't helped me at all at my job.

100
00:05:18,788 --> 00:05:21,129
It hasn't helped me at expressing a design opinion.

101
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:22,889
And that's because the talk, as I found out,

102
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:23,949
wasn't really actionable.

103
00:05:25,230 --> 00:05:27,870
Because it didn't explain how systemic agencies actually

104
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:28,431
create it.

105
00:05:28,671 --> 00:05:31,251
So I can't use it as a reference to talk to other people

106
00:05:31,291 --> 00:05:31,952
about it, right?

107
00:05:32,599 --> 00:05:37,902
And I was pretty much saying in 2012 that the core gameplay of Doom and Dead Space 2, which are both combat,

108
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:42,184
shares some major commonalities because they both afford lots of systemic agency.

109
00:05:42,204 --> 00:05:46,187
It's just that, oops, if you ask me to elaborate, I couldn't actually tell you how.

110
00:05:47,508 --> 00:05:48,628
Now I actually know why this happened.

111
00:05:49,933 --> 00:05:54,535
For one, it's because agency, the actual topic of that talk, is a result.

112
00:05:54,995 --> 00:05:57,276
It's a player-facing definition of something.

113
00:05:57,336 --> 00:06:00,396
It's a player-facing definition of players feeling empowered.

114
00:06:00,456 --> 00:06:03,557
So any analysis of this is bound to not be useful to designers

115
00:06:03,597 --> 00:06:05,758
because we're describing something that's important to players.

116
00:06:06,358 --> 00:06:09,579
But there's a bigger reason here, and those were three unspoken assumptions

117
00:06:09,899 --> 00:06:11,760
that I realized I made that I shouldn't have made.

118
00:06:14,795 --> 00:06:20,879
Now, in my mind, it was always crystal clear that the way we create agency is, well, it's going to be a result of meaningful choice.

119
00:06:21,079 --> 00:06:23,220
So I didn't even go into this. I didn't elaborate at all.

120
00:06:23,601 --> 00:06:30,705
I just assumed that, well, duh, if I tell you that you can take multiple approaches to a combat space, like I did using Bioshock as an example,

121
00:06:31,006 --> 00:06:37,770
everybody would automatically know how and why those approaches are meaningful or differentiated and how it's meaningful in the first place.

122
00:06:38,615 --> 00:06:44,780
Now, the second assumption was that, in my mind, meaningful choice had been really clearly defined through rules of play, actually.

123
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:50,144
So I didn't actually explain that concept, because I figured it was a shared understanding.

124
00:06:50,444 --> 00:06:53,307
Well, I can do this now, actually, real quick, and then the talk is over.

125
00:06:53,327 --> 00:07:01,433
Rules of play is the definition of meaningful choice is that meaningful choice has to be discernible and integrated.

126
00:07:01,932 --> 00:07:07,033
In other words, any choice that we present to the player in the game needs to be obvious to the player,

127
00:07:07,474 --> 00:07:09,994
both in the setup but also in the outcome that we get of it,

128
00:07:10,435 --> 00:07:14,576
and it needs to feed back into the game and advance the simulation in some shape or form.

129
00:07:15,816 --> 00:07:19,898
And I really like this definition. I've been using the definition in my own little design razor.

130
00:07:20,782 --> 00:07:25,126
Like, if you work with me, I usually analyze and design good gameplay by just asking,

131
00:07:25,166 --> 00:07:27,147
what is the skill check or the meaningful choice?

132
00:07:27,187 --> 00:07:30,750
The idea being that if we can really dig into that, at the end we'll kind of know

133
00:07:30,790 --> 00:07:32,432
if we have something that might be fun in the end.

134
00:07:33,452 --> 00:07:34,733
And, okay, great.

135
00:07:35,834 --> 00:07:39,197
The big problem is, assumption number three, I was actually making the assumption

136
00:07:39,217 --> 00:07:43,300
that this was a definition which was widely disseminated and agreed upon.

137
00:07:44,159 --> 00:07:45,481
And that's just simply not true.

138
00:07:46,041 --> 00:07:50,245
As I've been looking through all of these game design, psychology, biology books, and so on,

139
00:07:50,566 --> 00:07:52,508
the word meaningful is all over the place,

140
00:07:52,548 --> 00:07:57,012
and it's always used to describe slightly different things without ever really defining it.

141
00:07:57,032 --> 00:08:00,576
I mean, I didn't even bother to put examples up here because there were too many.

142
00:08:00,656 --> 00:08:03,779
Just believe me, I didn't know exactly what meaningful was supposed to mean.

143
00:08:04,421 --> 00:08:07,343
And I think that's a real problem because now if you want to talk about meaningful choice,

144
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:10,646
you don't have a shared understanding as to why decisions matter,

145
00:08:11,006 --> 00:08:14,849
and what meaningful choice actually is, and when meaningful choice is and isn't.

146
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:17,391
Same goes actually for this famous quote.

147
00:08:17,571 --> 00:08:19,933
I mean, it's clever, but it's not actionable either, right?

148
00:08:19,973 --> 00:08:23,275
Because interesting and meaningful are pretty much the same thing.

149
00:08:23,435 --> 00:08:26,718
So, how are you going to act on that?

150
00:08:28,499 --> 00:08:28,599
So...

151
00:08:30,112 --> 00:08:32,413
We don't really know what's interesting or meaningful.

152
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:34,833
And when we don't know if a decision is meaningful

153
00:08:34,933 --> 00:08:36,493
or interesting and when not, we're

154
00:08:36,513 --> 00:08:38,574
going to have a whole bunch of design meetings where we go,

155
00:08:38,814 --> 00:08:40,114
let's do that because that's totally

156
00:08:40,154 --> 00:08:41,114
interesting to the player.

157
00:08:41,434 --> 00:08:43,235
And that's not really a good design practice

158
00:08:43,295 --> 00:08:46,035
to design anything around and spend I don't know

159
00:08:46,075 --> 00:08:47,175
how many million dollars on.

160
00:08:47,595 --> 00:08:49,556
So that's what this talk is about today.

161
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:51,476
I want to talk about meaningful choice

162
00:08:51,556 --> 00:08:52,576
in game and level design.

163
00:08:52,616 --> 00:08:54,297
And instead of making assumptions this time,

164
00:08:54,377 --> 00:08:55,437
I'm going to start from scratch.

165
00:08:56,237 --> 00:08:58,257
So in this talk, I want to fully understand

166
00:08:58,338 --> 00:08:59,738
when and why choice matters to us.

167
00:09:01,121 --> 00:09:04,023
I want to understand why we play games as a result of that.

168
00:09:04,724 --> 00:09:07,026
And then I want to, this time, actually explain

169
00:09:07,066 --> 00:09:08,307
what systemic agency is.

170
00:09:09,628 --> 00:09:12,190
Because once I know how a systemic agency is actually

171
00:09:12,230 --> 00:09:14,252
created, and hopefully you guys know as well what

172
00:09:14,292 --> 00:09:16,173
I'm thinking about this, I can then go back

173
00:09:16,213 --> 00:09:19,096
and I can qualify why I believe that both doom and dead space

174
00:09:19,136 --> 00:09:22,098
are really made from the same cloth after all these years

175
00:09:22,138 --> 00:09:22,438
apart.

176
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:25,521
And then finally, the reason that the title of this talk

177
00:09:25,541 --> 00:09:27,983
specifically implicates level design is quite simple.

178
00:09:29,204 --> 00:09:30,345
I learned everything I know.

179
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:32,701
to my work as a level designer back then,

180
00:09:33,201 --> 00:09:34,441
especially making Doom level.

181
00:09:34,481 --> 00:09:35,862
So in the second part of this talk,

182
00:09:36,202 --> 00:09:37,763
I'm going to be talking a lot about Doom

183
00:09:37,783 --> 00:09:40,124
and about how Doom combat works, why it works,

184
00:09:40,505 --> 00:09:42,046
and how it creates systemic agency,

185
00:09:42,566 --> 00:09:44,547
and why I believe that even after all these years,

186
00:09:44,647 --> 00:09:47,468
Doom can still be a role model that other games can aspire to,

187
00:09:48,449 --> 00:09:50,550
because we might actually have forgotten some of that.

188
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:52,151
Now, before I do this, though, I'm

189
00:09:52,171 --> 00:09:53,432
going to do some fundamentals.

190
00:09:53,452 --> 00:09:55,593
I'm going to talk about games in the second part.

191
00:09:55,613 --> 00:09:57,834
But before this, I can imagine.

192
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,622
an alternate reality in which I never actually made the decision of coming to America.

193
00:10:02,922 --> 00:10:06,524
So I'm back in Germany, I'm a biologist now, and I'm trying to figure out the same kind

194
00:10:06,564 --> 00:10:07,004
of question.

195
00:10:07,685 --> 00:10:09,385
And why do decisions matter to us?

196
00:10:09,706 --> 00:10:12,887
And because I'm a biologist, I might actually dig into evolution.

197
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:17,109
And I might try to understand the biological underpinning as to why decisions are meaningful

198
00:10:17,149 --> 00:10:17,409
to us.

199
00:10:22,792 --> 00:10:26,934
Nature actually creates some very strict boundaries as to when and why organisms make decisions.

200
00:10:27,845 --> 00:10:30,466
and understanding those boundaries is actually going to be quite illuminating.

201
00:10:30,666 --> 00:10:32,267
But before I get to that in just a second,

202
00:10:32,588 --> 00:10:36,330
I want to give you some perspective as to why nature is such a hard ass in the first place.

203
00:10:38,151 --> 00:10:41,753
Having brains is a luxury. Brains are really expensive.

204
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:46,265
might be lost on us because we have a McDonald's around every single corner so we can just get all

205
00:10:46,305 --> 00:10:51,152
the energy that we need to actually feed this really hungry brain. But 20 percent of energy

206
00:10:51,292 --> 00:10:56,379
for an organ that's that tiny, that's a really big problem. So in nature, having a brain and

207
00:10:56,559 --> 00:10:58,722
using that to make decisions really is a luxury.

208
00:10:59,715 --> 00:11:03,916
And we also can't assume that a large brain automatically comes with benefits,

209
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:08,558
because there's been some really cool artificial evolution experiments with fruit flies

210
00:11:08,958 --> 00:11:11,960
that show how being smarter doesn't actually make you fitter to survive.

211
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:16,791
Like they bred some really smart fruit flies and some really dumb fruit flies

212
00:11:16,831 --> 00:11:20,432
and then put them together and all the smart fruit flies just died out.

213
00:11:20,712 --> 00:11:24,293
Because there was some cost to actually being smart and actually thinking about stuff

214
00:11:24,973 --> 00:11:29,374
and I guess there's something to be said for intuition over conscious thinking.

215
00:11:29,834 --> 00:11:32,455
So there's a real physiological cost that we know about,

216
00:11:32,595 --> 00:11:34,935
even if we don't know exactly how, to having a brain.

217
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:38,596
And that's the cost of building it, maintaining it, and using it.

218
00:11:39,136 --> 00:11:44,001
And when an animal does have a large brain and then uses that large brain to actually make decisions,

219
00:11:44,501 --> 00:11:45,703
there's got to be a reason for it.

220
00:11:46,603 --> 00:11:49,346
Now, there's one more major cause to having a large brain.

221
00:11:50,087 --> 00:11:53,510
And tell me why that is, but it's the cost of making decisions.

222
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,496
Now, of course, the problem with decisions is that as soon as you make a decision,

223
00:11:59,756 --> 00:12:02,419
you can make a mistake, and nature doesn't like mistakes.

224
00:12:02,839 --> 00:12:04,100
Mistakes mean you're going to die.

225
00:12:05,079 --> 00:12:09,081
And nature is going to try to protect animals from making decisions in the first place whenever possible

226
00:12:09,121 --> 00:12:11,822
and it's going to try to give them some sort of innate behavior.

227
00:12:12,383 --> 00:12:16,244
So in biology, there's actually an entire field of behavioral ecology

228
00:12:16,285 --> 00:12:19,626
that studies exactly when and why and how animals make decisions.

229
00:12:20,106 --> 00:12:23,288
Now, I'm totally butchering it for this talk, but the general rule is this.

230
00:12:24,268 --> 00:12:28,870
There are three situations, well, there are two situations in which animals learn,

231
00:12:29,231 --> 00:12:32,372
and there's one where they don't learn, and there's one where they do.

232
00:12:34,715 --> 00:12:37,277
You like that transition? Like my eyes always glaze over.

233
00:12:37,817 --> 00:12:41,600
So, animals don't learn when a pattern is so simple

234
00:12:41,940 --> 00:12:43,661
that an innate strategy is possible.

235
00:12:43,722 --> 00:12:46,964
Because in this case, evolution can just slowly hard-code

236
00:12:46,984 --> 00:12:49,265
the entire reaction via an innate behavior.

237
00:12:49,606 --> 00:12:50,966
So we get a cheaper brain out of that.

238
00:12:52,768 --> 00:12:54,869
Animals also don't learn, and they don't make decisions,

239
00:12:55,129 --> 00:12:56,690
when a situation is so complex

240
00:12:56,770 --> 00:12:59,172
that a strategy is completely impossible to discern.

241
00:12:59,612 --> 00:13:02,114
Because the actual patterns underlying that situation

242
00:13:02,154 --> 00:13:02,855
are not discernible.

243
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:05,360
So we might as well act randomly, right?

244
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,821
That's just as good as a strategy.

245
00:13:07,861 --> 00:13:10,181
If you're a little animal living on the forest floor here

246
00:13:10,281 --> 00:13:12,882
and you can't really make out all of this perspective,

247
00:13:13,222 --> 00:13:15,302
you're not going to understand when the next meal pops up.

248
00:13:15,923 --> 00:13:18,203
It's pretty much impossible for you to actually make order

249
00:13:18,263 --> 00:13:20,344
out of the chaos, so you might as well search randomly

250
00:13:20,364 --> 00:13:22,184
because it's just as effective and it's

251
00:13:22,204 --> 00:13:23,304
going to be much cheaper again.

252
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:26,145
So this is pretty much nature button mashing, right?

253
00:13:26,165 --> 00:13:27,825
Because that's going to get you to the same result.

254
00:13:28,405 --> 00:13:29,846
Now this doesn't mean, just to be clear,

255
00:13:29,866 --> 00:13:31,226
that there isn't a pattern here.

256
00:13:31,246 --> 00:13:33,167
It just means that for this specific animal.

257
00:13:34,266 --> 00:13:39,247
for its particular lifestyle, it's not possible or worthwhile to actually start making decisions.

258
00:13:39,827 --> 00:13:44,368
Now, of course, there's the spot in the middle, and this is where we are making decisions.

259
00:13:44,708 --> 00:13:48,809
It's what I call the sweet spot. It's an environment that is so variable and complex

260
00:13:48,929 --> 00:13:53,671
that we can never actually develop an innate strategy for it, but where the patterns themselves

261
00:13:53,751 --> 00:13:57,311
are still discernible enough to where we can actually learn the patterns and we can start

262
00:13:57,331 --> 00:14:02,293
making decisions. And as a general rule in nature, this happens when your own best strategy is not

263
00:14:02,333 --> 00:14:03,453
your children's best strategy.

264
00:14:03,983 --> 00:14:07,704
But more generally, you might also say that the more unpredictable,

265
00:14:07,904 --> 00:14:10,385
yet discernible an environment of a species is,

266
00:14:10,645 --> 00:14:12,326
the more decision-making is going to occur,

267
00:14:12,966 --> 00:14:15,427
which of course is exactly our environment.

268
00:14:15,727 --> 00:14:16,887
That's the environment we live in,

269
00:14:17,327 --> 00:14:19,968
and that's why we like learning so much, because we live in this world.

270
00:14:20,709 --> 00:14:22,469
We do that so we can make future decisions.

271
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:25,670
Now, real life is also the reason why we play games,

272
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:28,311
because real life is so seemingly chaotic

273
00:14:28,671 --> 00:14:31,132
that navigating all of the uncertainty of the real world

274
00:14:31,192 --> 00:14:32,573
is really emotionally taxing.

275
00:14:33,656 --> 00:14:37,277
Real life is not so complex. That's a problem that we might as well just act randomly.

276
00:14:37,297 --> 00:14:40,218
I mean, that might be a strategy. I don't know if anybody's tried that out.

277
00:14:40,278 --> 00:14:43,619
But there are enough patterns to where you actually want to learn and make decisions.

278
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:48,941
But the problem is that it's certainly not so simple that there's one innate strategy to deal with all of life.

279
00:14:49,501 --> 00:14:51,782
Well, there's one, I guess, which is heavy drinking.

280
00:14:51,842 --> 00:14:55,563
But beyond that, there aren't really innate strategies to actually dealing with life.

281
00:14:56,670 --> 00:15:00,131
So the real world is much closer over here somewhere, right, where it's discernible,

282
00:15:00,171 --> 00:15:04,053
but not always like we can't actually always make it out, than it is to this.

283
00:15:04,993 --> 00:15:07,514
Now games, on the other hand, are exactly in the sweet spot,

284
00:15:07,814 --> 00:15:10,876
because they're unpredictable yet highly discernible environments,

285
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:12,596
which are really rich in feedback.

286
00:15:12,676 --> 00:15:16,778
So achieving mastery over this environment is just immensely pleasurable to us,

287
00:15:16,798 --> 00:15:18,299
because it's the better version of life.

288
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:20,900
So...

289
00:15:21,723 --> 00:15:25,704
This should help us on the biological level a little bit, why and when choice matters.

290
00:15:25,805 --> 00:15:27,525
Well, at least the way that nature looks at it.

291
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:33,668
Choice matters in nature when the environment is so complex that an innate strategy is not possible,

292
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:35,428
but patterns are discernible.

293
00:15:36,569 --> 00:15:39,370
And the best strategy changes across generations.

294
00:15:42,131 --> 00:15:45,012
And we play games because the real world is often seemingly random,

295
00:15:45,032 --> 00:15:49,354
whereas in games, patterns are much easier to discern and feedback is much easier to get.

296
00:15:51,082 --> 00:15:54,325
So real life is over there, and games are somewhere over here.

297
00:15:55,826 --> 00:16:00,370
Now finally, the biologist in me just believes that choice matters to all of us,

298
00:16:00,730 --> 00:16:04,313
because the saying that a mind is a terrible thing to waste is actually true.

299
00:16:05,033 --> 00:16:08,816
At least in nature, because evolution won't even let you create that mind.

300
00:16:09,457 --> 00:16:10,338
You can't waste it.

301
00:16:10,978 --> 00:16:14,040
Because nature doesn't develop any sort of brains for frivolous actions.

302
00:16:14,441 --> 00:16:18,204
Animals only make decisions when there's no other way to deal with the situation,

303
00:16:18,804 --> 00:16:20,045
or until they create...

304
00:16:20,448 --> 00:16:21,228
McDonald's, I guess.

305
00:16:22,388 --> 00:16:24,349
Now, this is a little bit of a false equivalence, of course.

306
00:16:24,369 --> 00:16:26,789
We cannot simply equate human brains and human decision

307
00:16:26,829 --> 00:16:29,090
making to animal brains, animal decision makings.

308
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,750
But evolutionary biology is valid.

309
00:16:32,190 --> 00:16:35,611
And this is incredibly humbling to me,

310
00:16:35,651 --> 00:16:38,172
just having the knowledge that there are various birds out

311
00:16:38,212 --> 00:16:40,332
in nature which digest parts of their brain

312
00:16:40,432 --> 00:16:42,492
seasonally when that brain isn't required,

313
00:16:42,552 --> 00:16:44,613
because it's actually cheaper to break down the brain

314
00:16:44,653 --> 00:16:47,333
and build it back up next season than to keep it.

315
00:16:48,646 --> 00:16:50,247
That's incredibly humbling, right?

316
00:16:50,847 --> 00:16:53,769
So the way I look at every decision that I put in my games

317
00:16:53,950 --> 00:16:57,232
is that they should be subject to that same kind of evolutionary pressure

318
00:16:57,292 --> 00:16:58,933
where it falls into this area

319
00:16:58,973 --> 00:17:02,455
where nature would actually require you to develop a brain for it.

320
00:17:03,962 --> 00:17:08,566
No, that's all great, but it's 60 minutes in and I've been talking about a lot of biology.

321
00:17:09,046 --> 00:17:12,168
I actually put a checkmark into these two points, but I'm not quite done with it,

322
00:17:12,529 --> 00:17:13,990
because this might be a little bit esoteric.

323
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:17,252
So, I actually want to look at it from one more angle before I get to DOOM,

324
00:17:17,292 --> 00:17:19,534
and that's the psychology of motivation,

325
00:17:19,594 --> 00:17:23,257
which might be something that we're all a little bit more familiar with.

326
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,543
Now, up until the 50s, 59 actually, psychology was bleak.

327
00:17:32,892 --> 00:17:36,375
Behavior was always reduced to a small number of primary drives.

328
00:17:36,575 --> 00:17:40,978
Hunger, thirst, sex, the avoidance of pain, and pretty much everything that we were doing

329
00:17:40,998 --> 00:17:42,880
was supposedly motivated by deficits.

330
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,862
So you were always in the red and you were just trying to break even.

331
00:17:46,182 --> 00:17:49,905
You're always looking because we're hungry, thirsty, we wanted to do the other stuff.

332
00:17:50,425 --> 00:17:53,387
Or, you know, and as you're doing all of this, you didn't want to get hurt.

333
00:17:54,028 --> 00:17:55,729
And that to me is pretty bleak.

334
00:17:56,250 --> 00:17:59,032
And luckily, well actually there was a problem with this.

335
00:17:59,352 --> 00:18:01,333
This theory could not actually explain play.

336
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:07,704
There were a whole bunch of examples where humans and animals were engaging in activities that didn't support any of those primary drives.

337
00:18:07,924 --> 00:18:15,389
And it's kind of hard to justify that drive theory is the primal way in which we're actually making decisions,

338
00:18:15,429 --> 00:18:19,071
when rats are going through electrified wire just because they want to explore.

339
00:18:19,612 --> 00:18:26,316
Obviously, the avoidance of pain is not a strong enough drive for them to just go fuck off and, like, look at some other part of the laboratory.

340
00:18:28,337 --> 00:18:33,402
This is where Robert White in 1959 came along and he put a positive spin, which I like much better, on what motivates us.

341
00:18:33,923 --> 00:18:38,948
He took intrinsic motivation seriously and he championed it as an actual primary motivator.

342
00:18:40,429 --> 00:18:51,760
He proposed this concept of competence motivation for activities in which the sole rewards are the spontaneous feeling of interest and enjoyment that occur when one engages in the activities.

343
00:18:52,220 --> 00:18:52,681
Now these days...

344
00:18:53,642 --> 00:18:56,224
We unite competence as well as autonomy and relatedness,

345
00:18:56,684 --> 00:18:58,785
and then the umbrella of self-determination theory,

346
00:18:59,145 --> 00:19:01,887
which is one of the most widely studied and applied theories

347
00:19:01,927 --> 00:19:03,608
of motivations, including games.

348
00:19:04,048 --> 00:19:05,249
There's actually a book which was

349
00:19:05,709 --> 00:19:08,331
co-written by one of the founders of self-determination

350
00:19:08,371 --> 00:19:09,771
theory called Glued to Games.

351
00:19:10,272 --> 00:19:12,933
And it applies all of the findings of SDT

352
00:19:12,973 --> 00:19:15,275
to computer games and analyzes exactly why

353
00:19:15,355 --> 00:19:17,556
games are incredibly good at fulfilling

354
00:19:17,656 --> 00:19:19,597
our basic psychological needs and why

355
00:19:19,637 --> 00:19:20,578
they make us good to play.

356
00:19:21,158 --> 00:19:23,819
Now, the needs, again, are competence, autonomy,

357
00:19:23,859 --> 00:19:24,520
and relatedness.

358
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:26,321
And I don't want to go too deep into it

359
00:19:26,361 --> 00:19:27,882
and try to really get distracted by all

360
00:19:27,902 --> 00:19:29,322
of the details of the psychology.

361
00:19:29,783 --> 00:19:32,184
If you do want to do that, you can read this book.

362
00:19:32,464 --> 00:19:34,145
And you should read it on top of Glued to Games,

363
00:19:34,185 --> 00:19:37,947
because there's no reason why every game designer and game

364
00:19:37,967 --> 00:19:39,928
developer shouldn't have done that already.

365
00:19:40,449 --> 00:19:41,589
But so here are just the highlights,

366
00:19:41,629 --> 00:19:43,870
the important things you need to know for the rest of this talk.

367
00:19:44,731 --> 00:19:47,653
STD proposes that all three of these categories, competence,

368
00:19:47,713 --> 00:19:50,274
autonomy, and relatedness, are universal needs.

369
00:19:50,795 --> 00:19:54,756
that they are not motivated by deficits, that they are innate to all human beings,

370
00:19:55,196 --> 00:19:57,597
and that they are essential to our health and well-being.

371
00:19:58,618 --> 00:20:02,459
And if one, or ideally more than one, of these needs is fulfilled by an activity,

372
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:06,161
we feel intrinsically motivated, right? We feel good.

373
00:20:08,142 --> 00:20:11,305
So, games are really good at making us feel competent, autonomous, and related.

374
00:20:11,345 --> 00:20:15,749
We save the world, we explore the world, or our inner selves as we're doing that,

375
00:20:15,909 --> 00:20:19,852
and people keep showing us with recognition, or we get to kill them in multiplayer.

376
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:22,354
I mean, that's a way to feel related to somebody as well, I guess.

377
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:28,860
And I think that SDT can also explain when and why decisions are meaningful to us,

378
00:20:28,900 --> 00:20:29,781
because I submit that...

379
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:40,951
Definitions in games, decisions in games are going to be meaningful to us when the outcome of that decision satisfies one of our needs of competence, autonomy or relatedness.

380
00:20:41,431 --> 00:20:51,599
This is something that you do not see explicitly explored in Good2Games because ultimately it's a psychology book, but it has to be this way because games make us feel good by satisfying psychological need.

381
00:20:52,307 --> 00:20:57,970
The medium specificity of games is interactivity, and the only way to engage with that interactivity is by making choices.

382
00:20:58,090 --> 00:21:02,412
So making decisions must actually lead to some sort of emotional well-being.

383
00:21:03,873 --> 00:21:14,358
But only, and that's the one big caveat, if our, like, psychological needs of car, as I call it, competence, autonomy, or relatedness are actually fulfilled.

384
00:21:14,378 --> 00:21:15,399
Right?

385
00:21:16,939 --> 00:21:20,161
So this is the other way in which I'm looking into why decisions are meaningful to us.

386
00:21:20,221 --> 00:21:23,283
If one of these base needs is going to be fulfilled in some shape or form,

387
00:21:23,663 --> 00:21:28,627
then the decisions that lead to that are going to be interesting or meaningful to us.

388
00:21:30,148 --> 00:21:33,551
Okay, so let's get to Doom and let's get to an example of how all this information,

389
00:21:33,591 --> 00:21:37,333
hopefully all starts forming one big picture and starts working out in practice.

390
00:21:37,513 --> 00:21:42,757
And how, through all of this, we can figure out what this mythical systemic agency actually is

391
00:21:42,857 --> 00:21:44,218
and why Doom has so much of it.

392
00:21:48,886 --> 00:21:50,607
Actually, I want to do one quick poll.

393
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:53,809
Who here, by show of hands, is over 28 years old?

394
00:21:55,930 --> 00:21:56,910
OK, that's still quite a few.

395
00:22:00,312 --> 00:22:03,074
It's absolutely amazing to me that Doom is 20 years old.

396
00:22:03,634 --> 00:22:04,634
Because you know what that means?

397
00:22:04,714 --> 00:22:06,375
Now, you can tell me you did it, but there's

398
00:22:06,395 --> 00:22:08,777
going to be a whole generation of level designers and game

399
00:22:08,817 --> 00:22:10,858
designers who are going to be entering the industry who

400
00:22:10,878 --> 00:22:12,699
weren't even alive when Doom came out.

401
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:15,440
And that is pretty crazy.

402
00:22:17,709 --> 00:22:25,794
But so, it actually is 20 years old, so you know what, let's just gain some perspective and remember, or imagine if you have to, what it was like to play Doom back then for the first time.

403
00:22:26,395 --> 00:22:30,498
You're entering this 3D environment which is completely overpowering your senses, right?

404
00:22:30,518 --> 00:22:38,523
I mean, yes, Wolfenstein had been out, Ultima Underworld was out there, but the way that Doom really controlled and how you were moving around was something very new.

405
00:22:38,984 --> 00:22:41,710
And because it was very new, you had no idea how to move around.

406
00:22:41,870 --> 00:22:42,752
You weren't really good at it.

407
00:22:42,812 --> 00:22:44,556
I mean, how did you even control this game?

408
00:22:44,616 --> 00:22:46,741
Was it keyboard, mouse, joystick?

409
00:22:47,041 --> 00:22:47,843
I went through all of those.

410
00:22:48,562 --> 00:22:52,845
Now, so now you're clumsy moving around because you don't know exactly how to control the game.

411
00:22:53,246 --> 00:22:56,728
You don't know what's ahead, so you're scared shitless of all the monsters coming at you,

412
00:22:56,768 --> 00:22:59,430
and you're probably just standing there and shooting at them frantically

413
00:22:59,831 --> 00:23:01,712
because you can't even move around competently.

414
00:23:02,072 --> 00:23:05,095
But then you play the game for a little bit, and you realize you can actually strafe.

415
00:23:05,495 --> 00:23:09,158
And what's better, you can actually strafe to avoid all of those fireballs which are shooting at you.

416
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:15,460
After a while, you might even be able to be good enough to use that strafing to get closer

417
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,141
to enemies instead of running away from them.

418
00:23:17,221 --> 00:23:19,962
So you actually start feeling pretty good about playing this game.

419
00:23:20,502 --> 00:23:25,324
Well, then you hit E1M8, you meet your first two barons of hell, and you're mortified again.

420
00:23:25,384 --> 00:23:26,505
You die a couple of times.

421
00:23:27,025 --> 00:23:27,625
But then you know what?

422
00:23:27,665 --> 00:23:31,267
You realize you can circle strafe around them as well, and they're not really all that bad,

423
00:23:31,307 --> 00:23:35,869
as I figured out, because they take exactly five full blasts with the double barrel shotgun.

424
00:23:36,329 --> 00:23:36,649
And they're done.

425
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,661
Now, of course, to be having a double-barreled shotgun,

426
00:23:39,681 --> 00:23:41,621
you had to be playing Doom II, because Doom I

427
00:23:41,641 --> 00:23:42,502
didn't have that weapon.

428
00:23:43,002 --> 00:23:45,603
But that's actually the game that I made all of my levels

429
00:23:45,663 --> 00:23:45,883
for.

430
00:23:46,163 --> 00:23:47,404
And it just took me that long, because I

431
00:23:47,424 --> 00:23:48,564
didn't have a modem before that.

432
00:23:48,604 --> 00:23:50,285
So I couldn't actually download an editor.

433
00:23:50,985 --> 00:23:52,826
But so when I started playing Doom then,

434
00:23:53,006 --> 00:23:54,747
or when I started making levels for Doom,

435
00:23:54,847 --> 00:23:56,588
I was already an expert Doom player.

436
00:23:56,648 --> 00:23:58,768
And I could actually apply all of that knowledge

437
00:23:58,828 --> 00:24:01,730
as to how Doom was fun on that level to making my levels.

438
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:04,291
And it was one hell of a formative experience.

439
00:24:04,351 --> 00:24:05,952
I mean, obviously, I'm doing a talk on it now.

440
00:24:06,272 --> 00:24:08,293
It taught me a lot about game and level design.

441
00:24:08,874 --> 00:24:12,075
The Doom is also a great example of how good action games satisfy

442
00:24:12,135 --> 00:24:14,576
competence needs and how at the lowest level

443
00:24:14,636 --> 00:24:15,637
actually make us feel good.

444
00:24:16,077 --> 00:24:17,298
So I want to look at that first.

445
00:24:18,258 --> 00:24:20,439
Competence is defined as an intrinsic need,

446
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:23,701
the intrinsic need to effectively deal with the environment,

447
00:24:23,821 --> 00:24:26,282
actually master it, to not be bumbling around and falling

448
00:24:26,342 --> 00:24:27,423
over our own feet and so on.

449
00:24:28,078 --> 00:24:33,161
Clue2Games calls it the experience of overcoming a challenge or extending our abilities in

450
00:24:33,201 --> 00:24:33,982
a meaningful way.

451
00:24:34,462 --> 00:24:39,164
To be truly satisfying, however, our successes need to occur in the context of a real challenge.

452
00:24:39,825 --> 00:24:40,965
And that's what Doom is, right?

453
00:24:41,286 --> 00:24:44,707
It provides an environment that we can master in the context of a real challenge.

454
00:24:46,869 --> 00:24:51,071
There's no doubt that the fine motor skills required to aim, the timing skills that you're

455
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:54,493
going to have to have to line up enemies and shoot at them.

456
00:24:55,712 --> 00:24:57,694
the judgment that's going to be needed for missile weapons,

457
00:24:57,734 --> 00:24:59,095
because those are moving enemies,

458
00:24:59,215 --> 00:25:01,097
and just the general rhythm and cadence that's

459
00:25:01,137 --> 00:25:04,580
going to come out of how quickly your weapons and the enemy

460
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:05,381
weapons are shooting.

461
00:25:05,401 --> 00:25:06,982
Now, these are all elements which

462
00:25:07,022 --> 00:25:09,344
are going to combine into a very compelling challenge.

463
00:25:10,045 --> 00:25:12,187
So the act of playing Doom at this low level

464
00:25:12,267 --> 00:25:15,009
can be committed to procedural memory at some point, what

465
00:25:15,029 --> 00:25:16,030
we call muscle memory.

466
00:25:16,711 --> 00:25:18,973
At some point, I can actually play Doom in my sleep.

467
00:25:20,131 --> 00:25:25,595
It's not quite an innate behavior, but it's the closest we can get to actually having something imprinted in our brain.

468
00:25:27,096 --> 00:25:32,119
So everything about Doom kind of feeds into an established narrative of why we like action games so much.

469
00:25:32,259 --> 00:25:37,823
We are inherently motivated to achieve competence over an environment or an object.

470
00:25:38,223 --> 00:25:39,324
I still can't do this.

471
00:25:40,157 --> 00:25:43,200
And games are this really feedback-rich environment

472
00:25:43,300 --> 00:25:46,203
that test our survival skills and keep us optimally challenged

473
00:25:46,283 --> 00:25:48,966
as we're achieving mastery over all of the dangers

474
00:25:49,026 --> 00:25:51,328
which are literally like threatening our very existence.

475
00:25:52,089 --> 00:25:54,612
Now the question here is that the way we talk about dooms,

476
00:25:54,672 --> 00:25:56,234
we're talking about survival skills.

477
00:25:56,714 --> 00:25:58,336
Does that actually have to do anything with choice?

478
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,924
Like I said earlier that decisions are bound to be meaningful when they fulfill some sort of base psychological need like competence,

479
00:26:04,984 --> 00:26:10,187
but how does this actually apply to skill checks, survival skills, because this is supposed to be instinctual, right?

480
00:26:10,267 --> 00:26:12,728
It's supposed to be imprinted in our muscle memory.

481
00:26:13,489 --> 00:26:15,650
So where at the lowest level is the choice here?

482
00:26:16,591 --> 00:26:21,173
Maybe my entire thesis just falls apart and I shouldn't have done this talk, but I mean that's part of the narrative.

483
00:26:21,273 --> 00:26:26,296
Doom is a really good action game. Action games are fun and compelling and meaningful because, well, tense,

484
00:26:26,777 --> 00:26:28,478
and oh my god, look at all the skill checks.

485
00:26:29,045 --> 00:26:30,825
But in fact, if you're looking at my design razor,

486
00:26:30,925 --> 00:26:34,326
I have explicitly put skill check as a component in there.

487
00:26:34,346 --> 00:26:36,967
So I can actually test for that, like the Twitch skills, which

488
00:26:37,007 --> 00:26:37,967
are going to come out of something.

489
00:26:38,687 --> 00:26:40,208
Now, one thing we have to remember here,

490
00:26:40,548 --> 00:26:43,169
where it doesn't fall apart, is that a skill check is not

491
00:26:43,209 --> 00:26:44,429
something a player actually does.

492
00:26:44,629 --> 00:26:46,270
It's something that a player reacts to.

493
00:26:46,850 --> 00:26:50,271
And how we react to the skill check is by making decisions.

494
00:26:51,571 --> 00:26:52,651
According to Glu2 Games.

495
00:26:53,584 --> 00:26:57,347
Blue2Games, a game has to have three properties to fulfill these competent needs.

496
00:26:57,507 --> 00:27:01,990
It has to have clarity about the goal at hand, challenge that is not overwhelming,

497
00:27:02,551 --> 00:27:05,753
and clear feedback on our actions that make us feel like we learned something.

498
00:27:05,873 --> 00:27:07,855
And it's exactly this last part right here.

499
00:27:09,022 --> 00:27:13,665
That is so important, because it actually does explain how games are meaningful at the moment-to-moment level.

500
00:27:14,125 --> 00:27:18,548
Because if we do react to skill checks by making decisions and adjusting our aim and so on,

501
00:27:18,929 --> 00:27:20,450
we need to be fully in control.

502
00:27:20,750 --> 00:27:24,873
And that requires very good science and feedback as well as very good controls in the first place.

503
00:27:26,437 --> 00:27:30,763
So what I really mean when I ask, what is the skill check or the meaningful choice, is probably this.

504
00:27:32,085 --> 00:27:39,815
How good are the 3Cs and the science and feedback that are implicated whenever the game expects me to react to a skill check by making a split-second decision?

505
00:27:42,755 --> 00:27:46,037
Because I can only make split-second decisions really well if the three C's,

506
00:27:46,277 --> 00:27:48,058
camera, character, control, are awesome.

507
00:27:48,499 --> 00:27:51,201
And when the science and feedback I'm getting to everything that I'm doing

508
00:27:51,261 --> 00:27:52,642
is very clear and unambiguous.

509
00:27:52,942 --> 00:27:54,663
Because then I can get into this flow state

510
00:27:54,723 --> 00:27:57,465
where the controls just melt away and I'm one with the game.

511
00:27:57,945 --> 00:28:01,068
And that's where my competence needs are actually fulfilled,

512
00:28:01,128 --> 00:28:04,210
because the amount of immediate feedback from the game,

513
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,732
like to each of my low-level actions,

514
00:28:06,832 --> 00:28:10,234
actually allows me to master all of the skill checks that the game is throwing at me.

515
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:16,063
So science and feedback, at least in the skill check scenario,

516
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,486
are actually the lowest level in which a game creates systemic agency,

517
00:28:19,646 --> 00:28:20,907
and agency in general.

518
00:28:21,548 --> 00:28:24,651
And that might be a little bit weird because the way we usually talk about agency

519
00:28:25,031 --> 00:28:27,573
is in terms of big decisions and big choices.

520
00:28:27,973 --> 00:28:32,177
In fact, we often abuse it now to just say something like player freedom, which is wrong.

521
00:28:33,058 --> 00:28:35,100
Agency just means, at the simplest level,

522
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,822
that it is the satisfying power to take meaningful action

523
00:28:37,862 --> 00:28:40,104
and see the results of our decisions and choices.

524
00:28:40,799 --> 00:28:45,382
And that's exactly a big part of the reason why we feel so much in control of the combat encounter

525
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:47,883
when we get into this slow state in a game like this,

526
00:28:47,963 --> 00:28:53,407
because of the low-level systemic agency that's afforded via the science and feedback in the three Cs.

527
00:28:56,088 --> 00:28:59,210
And that then in return creates satisfaction of our competence needs, right?

528
00:28:59,230 --> 00:29:01,911
That's what we're feeling really good about having mastered this environment.

529
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:06,571
So you might actually say that Doom at the lowest level is a series of interesting decisions.

530
00:29:06,991 --> 00:29:10,993
Although you might really have to say it's a series of low-level control-related decisions.

531
00:29:12,033 --> 00:29:15,515
But everything I do in this game is discernible and integrated, and the decisions that I make,

532
00:29:15,875 --> 00:29:19,276
such as how to move around, where to move, when to shoot, actually matter.

533
00:29:20,937 --> 00:29:22,077
So, that's part of this.

534
00:29:22,537 --> 00:29:25,799
Mastering skill checks via good pre-season, via good science and feedback.

535
00:29:26,059 --> 00:29:29,460
And they do need to be good, because if they're not good, we can't control the game,

536
00:29:29,500 --> 00:29:31,461
and then the competence needs aren't actually fulfilled.

537
00:29:31,993 --> 00:29:33,173
But this creates agency.

538
00:29:34,494 --> 00:29:38,695
And this low-level agency that I'm talking about is certainly part of systemic agency

539
00:29:38,735 --> 00:29:42,176
and making sure that, you know, the game plays and feels good.

540
00:29:42,736 --> 00:29:44,357
Now, of course, the question is, is that all?

541
00:29:44,477 --> 00:29:49,579
Because if the fulfillment of all the competence needs is the only good thing that an action game needs,

542
00:29:50,179 --> 00:29:52,499
there's a lot of games out there that should be awesome, right?

543
00:29:53,300 --> 00:29:55,821
Glut2Games actually has a section in which it analyzes Doom,

544
00:29:55,861 --> 00:29:57,541
specifically through the lens of competence.

545
00:29:57,561 --> 00:29:59,182
It's kind of one of their poster childs.

546
00:29:59,742 --> 00:30:00,682
And it makes this argument.

547
00:30:02,030 --> 00:30:02,451
It says that,

548
00:30:03,031 --> 00:30:04,932
it is the gradual progression of challenges

549
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,473
as the player marches into hell

550
00:30:06,793 --> 00:30:09,095
that provides the strongest motivational pull of doom

551
00:30:09,295 --> 00:30:11,496
in virtually all successful FPS games.

552
00:30:12,117 --> 00:30:13,097
That progression is key.

553
00:30:13,457 --> 00:30:15,099
With each hellish opponent you fell,

554
00:30:15,119 --> 00:30:18,000
there's a small victory won on your road to the larger goal.

555
00:30:18,401 --> 00:30:19,741
From a competence standpoint,

556
00:30:20,002 --> 00:30:21,743
these small moment-to-moment victories

557
00:30:21,803 --> 00:30:23,043
are more like a trail of chocolates,

558
00:30:23,384 --> 00:30:25,565
each providing a small bite of satisfaction

559
00:30:25,625 --> 00:30:27,306
as the player succeeds and progresses

560
00:30:27,346 --> 00:30:28,307
towards a larger victory.

561
00:30:29,147 --> 00:30:29,988
That's quite poetic.

562
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,781
I don't want to put words in their mouth.

563
00:30:32,821 --> 00:30:34,662
To me, this reads a little bit like what they're saying

564
00:30:34,722 --> 00:30:39,484
is that you need to be able to point a gun at somebody,

565
00:30:39,624 --> 00:30:41,505
and you need to be able to overcome a progression

566
00:30:41,525 --> 00:30:43,306
of challenges, of skill checks.

567
00:30:44,227 --> 00:30:46,568
And if you do that, you're going to have a really successful

568
00:30:46,788 --> 00:30:47,668
first-person shooter game.

569
00:30:48,329 --> 00:30:48,949
Don't get me wrong.

570
00:30:48,969 --> 00:30:50,610
I actually do agree with this in one way.

571
00:30:50,950 --> 00:30:53,211
I do believe that Doom's rational level design,

572
00:30:53,371 --> 00:30:55,672
like the game system story, of which I didn't have a picture

573
00:30:55,692 --> 00:30:57,973
except for 1313, I believe this is important.

574
00:30:58,253 --> 00:30:58,554
Like, um.

575
00:31:01,937 --> 00:31:07,204
overcoming the challenges thrown at me in Doom and how finely that's tuned is a big part of why that game is good,

576
00:31:07,244 --> 00:31:12,651
but having played as much Doom as I have in my lifetime and just playing the same level over and over again,

577
00:31:12,671 --> 00:31:15,896
I think if we just have this outlook, we seriously missed a mark.

578
00:31:16,561 --> 00:31:21,402
Because we're trying to identify competence needs as the main reason as to why Doom's gameplay was so successful.

579
00:31:21,482 --> 00:31:26,323
And how many modern games do you know that have good aiming, good movement, good science and feedback,

580
00:31:26,723 --> 00:31:29,464
and they probably have an enemy progression as well, but things get harder,

581
00:31:29,484 --> 00:31:33,064
and they're still not really fun to play because there's some sort of spark missing?

582
00:31:33,604 --> 00:31:37,445
I mean, hell, I only have to stay within the same franchise and go one game down

583
00:31:37,505 --> 00:31:41,506
to know that a competent execution of a progression of challenges is just not enough.

584
00:31:43,875 --> 00:31:46,937
So there's a danger to thinking about action games in terms of competence only.

585
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:50,399
And that's a trap that many games unfortunately fall into.

586
00:31:50,419 --> 00:31:53,161
I would have loved to play an extra clip here.

587
00:31:53,701 --> 00:31:57,964
But this is why playing Doom 1 and 2, analyzing Doom 1 and 2, is really a big deal to me.

588
00:31:58,004 --> 00:31:58,724
That's why I'm doing it.

589
00:31:58,784 --> 00:32:03,287
Because to me, it's the reminder that Doom doesn't just frame its core component, its

590
00:32:03,307 --> 00:32:05,168
systemic agency, in terms of competence.

591
00:32:07,489 --> 00:32:09,991
There's something else to Doom, something else that needs to be there.

592
00:32:11,022 --> 00:32:14,745
to really make good combat in these kind of shooters,

593
00:32:15,185 --> 00:32:17,867
something that satisfies another psychological need,

594
00:32:17,907 --> 00:32:18,647
and that's autonomy.

595
00:32:19,288 --> 00:32:21,889
And pretty much what this comes down to is that Doom works

596
00:32:21,949 --> 00:32:25,011
because it has orthogonal unit differentiation.

597
00:32:25,672 --> 00:32:29,554
Now, I love the term orthogonal unit differentiation

598
00:32:29,594 --> 00:32:31,636
because in pretentiousness and awkwardness,

599
00:32:31,736 --> 00:32:34,057
it's only second to ludonarrative dissonance.

600
00:32:35,878 --> 00:32:37,700
So I'll spare myself some trouble here.

601
00:32:40,905 --> 00:32:45,527
I'll just call it OUD, or simply differentiation, but we should talk about it.

602
00:32:45,547 --> 00:32:51,130
It's something that Harvey Smith introduced at GDC in 2003, so this was like 11 years ago.

603
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:57,693
OUD gives us a way to talk about how game systems are meaningfully differentiated in their abilities and behaviors,

604
00:32:58,293 --> 00:33:01,515
and how that distinction leads to some interesting and complex gameplay.

605
00:33:01,975 --> 00:33:05,756
It leads to what I called in 2012 an expressive possibility space.

606
00:33:06,272 --> 00:33:07,954
But once again, this was a little bit misleading.

607
00:33:07,994 --> 00:33:09,276
So I'm going to take it from the top

608
00:33:09,716 --> 00:33:11,699
and actually start by establishing a better

609
00:33:11,739 --> 00:33:15,163
presentation or representation of Doom's possibilities

610
00:33:15,204 --> 00:33:15,985
based in the first place.

611
00:33:18,052 --> 00:33:20,973
And here's something that you figure out after playing Doom for a long time.

612
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:25,655
The enemies and the weapon in this game are actually really finely tuned to interact on

613
00:33:25,695 --> 00:33:26,556
multiple axes.

614
00:33:26,876 --> 00:33:30,878
What first looks like this visceral, barely controllable, maybe even simplistic fight

615
00:33:30,898 --> 00:33:36,140
for survival is actually this really complex interplay of many gameplay elements that allow

616
00:33:36,160 --> 00:33:38,061
forever new tactics and strategies.

617
00:33:38,581 --> 00:33:39,902
And this all happens via OUD.

618
00:33:40,535 --> 00:33:42,496
Because if you're looking at the enemy classes in Doom,

619
00:33:42,636 --> 00:33:44,417
I can map every single enemy type

620
00:33:44,497 --> 00:33:48,978
across some orthogonally differentiated categories.

621
00:33:49,699 --> 00:33:52,139
There's an axis where I can map all of the hitscan

622
00:33:52,159 --> 00:33:53,260
versus projectile guys.

623
00:33:53,660 --> 00:33:56,061
Those are the two classes of enemies that exist in Doom.

624
00:33:57,461 --> 00:33:59,942
And then I can also do this by the amount of damage they do.

625
00:34:00,522 --> 00:34:01,983
And then there's a second axis, which

626
00:34:02,023 --> 00:34:04,584
are charging enemies versus enemies which stay back,

627
00:34:04,764 --> 00:34:06,664
which is just a function of their overall speed,

628
00:34:06,704 --> 00:34:09,165
but also the behavior that they're subject to.

629
00:34:09,833 --> 00:34:13,354
Then if I put all of this together, I can create a chart that looks like this.

630
00:34:13,594 --> 00:34:16,875
And this is actually a pretty accurate representation of Doom's possibility space,

631
00:34:16,915 --> 00:34:20,296
at least as it pertains to these specific enemies and what's important to me.

632
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,236
And as you notice, the enemy distribution actually already covers a large part of the entire spectrum.

633
00:34:25,777 --> 00:34:28,957
I left out some enemies there, so I'm sure I could pretty much fill it in all the way.

634
00:34:29,497 --> 00:34:33,938
But what this does is allow the player to have a very specific opinion on each enemy type,

635
00:34:33,978 --> 00:34:35,398
because they know what they stand for.

636
00:34:35,779 --> 00:34:38,279
And that allows them to prioritize enemies in each encounter.

637
00:34:39,540 --> 00:34:44,503
So if I'm looking at this example, which enemy would you want to take out first with your shotgun?

638
00:34:45,424 --> 00:34:51,188
I'm assuming it's that black shotgunner dude back there because he has a hitscan weapon and he can deal immediate damage.

639
00:34:51,469 --> 00:34:56,012
And I know about this. Whereas all those fireballs that are thrown at me, I can dodge those.

640
00:34:56,352 --> 00:34:59,294
Those guys are called imps, by the way, in case you didn't play Doom.

641
00:35:00,956 --> 00:35:07,941
So the reason why Doom works so well is that each enemy represents a distinct, consistent, and discernible behavior that can be learned.

642
00:35:08,686 --> 00:35:11,688
And because there are only a few traits to all of these enemies,

643
00:35:12,388 --> 00:35:14,029
which just fall across two axes,

644
00:35:14,329 --> 00:35:15,770
I can actually learn this rather quickly.

645
00:35:16,290 --> 00:35:19,092
So this is information that players are going to internalize,

646
00:35:19,112 --> 00:35:20,192
and that's really important to them.

647
00:35:20,232 --> 00:35:22,673
So I want to look at how the player actually processes

648
00:35:22,733 --> 00:35:24,214
and stores this kind of information.

649
00:35:24,835 --> 00:35:27,976
And they do this via a psychological construct called a schema,

650
00:35:28,637 --> 00:35:31,278
which is an organized pattern of thought or behavior

651
00:35:31,558 --> 00:35:33,579
that organizes categories of information

652
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:35,700
and the relationship among them.

653
00:35:36,524 --> 00:35:39,445
And then information which is thrown at me is either assimilated,

654
00:35:39,905 --> 00:35:42,907
it's pretty much integrated into the schema, into an existing one,

655
00:35:43,327 --> 00:35:46,249
or it can be accommodated, which means that it doesn't fit.

656
00:35:46,289 --> 00:35:48,911
I actually have to create a new schema for this information

657
00:35:48,951 --> 00:35:53,513
because I realized that a striped horse is actually a zebra and not a striped horse.

658
00:35:55,475 --> 00:35:58,256
We can actually be a little bit finer with what exactly a schema is,

659
00:35:58,416 --> 00:36:00,437
and we can do this by what information they store.

660
00:36:00,918 --> 00:36:03,019
We call schemas a frame.

661
00:36:03,961 --> 00:36:06,562
when they contain properties and behaviors of something,

662
00:36:06,622 --> 00:36:08,523
and we call them a script when they

663
00:36:08,843 --> 00:36:11,924
hold some sort of processes how we approach a situation

664
00:36:12,505 --> 00:36:13,765
or how we deal with an object.

665
00:36:13,825 --> 00:36:16,766
So in Doom's case, the attributes of the enemy

666
00:36:16,786 --> 00:36:20,368
would be its frame, while the player tactics of how

667
00:36:20,388 --> 00:36:22,429
to actually approach this enemy would be its script.

668
00:36:23,669 --> 00:36:25,810
And players can easily create frames and scripts

669
00:36:25,870 --> 00:36:27,091
for each enemy type in Doom.

670
00:36:27,491 --> 00:36:29,272
They know exactly what the enemy represents,

671
00:36:29,352 --> 00:36:30,312
how best to deal with them.

672
00:36:31,247 --> 00:36:34,167
And everything is very clear-cut because it's all differentiated.

673
00:36:35,288 --> 00:36:36,048
So far, so good.

674
00:36:36,408 --> 00:36:40,689
All of the individual units have clear and concise properties and behaviors,

675
00:36:40,729 --> 00:36:44,590
which creates some very clearly discernible patterns to each one of these guys.

676
00:36:44,991 --> 00:36:48,772
And just each pattern encountered on its own is going to be a no-brainer.

677
00:36:49,452 --> 00:36:52,113
What's interesting is what happens once I put them into conflict,

678
00:36:52,173 --> 00:36:54,353
because then, quite literally, all hell breaks loose.

679
00:36:54,753 --> 00:36:56,334
Looking back at this picture right here,

680
00:36:57,474 --> 00:36:59,255
do we really want to take out the shotgunner first?

681
00:36:59,875 --> 00:37:03,159
Is that a script that I can reliably follow for all of Doom?

682
00:37:03,399 --> 00:37:04,960
Deal with the hitscan guys first.

683
00:37:05,501 --> 00:37:08,403
Because that black dude in the back certainly can shoot us immediately

684
00:37:08,484 --> 00:37:11,146
while I dodge all the fireballs by those imps,

685
00:37:11,226 --> 00:37:14,729
except that that imp over there has actually gotten pretty close to me, right?

686
00:37:14,809 --> 00:37:16,811
I might not be able to strafe out of the way anymore.

687
00:37:17,372 --> 00:37:18,993
So this is actually a judgment call.

688
00:37:19,033 --> 00:37:22,356
I don't actually know exactly how I'm going to prioritize the situation.

689
00:37:23,086 --> 00:37:26,009
And I call this, funnily enough, prioritization choice,

690
00:37:26,349 --> 00:37:29,892
because I get to have an opinion on how to approach this encounter

691
00:37:30,293 --> 00:37:31,694
and how I prioritize it.

692
00:37:34,176 --> 00:37:38,020
Now, prioritization choice is created from the complex interplay of systems

693
00:37:38,260 --> 00:37:39,901
that are easily understood individually,

694
00:37:40,302 --> 00:37:43,344
but that combine into situations that don't have a consistent

695
00:37:43,464 --> 00:37:44,986
or obviously superior tactic.

696
00:37:45,570 --> 00:37:50,791
And that creates a really interesting game in Doom in which the overall combat experience is clearly defined.

697
00:37:51,091 --> 00:37:55,151
Like, there is a quality to playing Doom, there's an overall strategy to playing Doom as well.

698
00:37:55,551 --> 00:37:58,452
And I can learn that, and I still remember that, have it internalized,

699
00:37:58,532 --> 00:38:02,513
it involves prioritizing enemies, lots and lots of strafing around,

700
00:38:02,913 --> 00:38:07,594
lining up enemies in very specific lines, picking the right weapon for the right job, and so on.

701
00:38:08,134 --> 00:38:13,815
But what I can't ever do for Doom is create a script that works for all combat encounters in Doom equally.

702
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:22,680
And that's because the combination of multiple orthogonally differentiated enemies

703
00:38:23,001 --> 00:38:27,933
creates situations in which an obviously superior tactic pretty much never exists.

704
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:30,433
And this is really interesting to our brains, right?

705
00:38:30,574 --> 00:38:32,756
This actually leads to interesting decisions,

706
00:38:32,816 --> 00:38:35,238
because what we've created now is something quite familiar.

707
00:38:35,298 --> 00:38:35,678
It's this.

708
00:38:36,399 --> 00:38:38,141
It's an environment in which patterns

709
00:38:38,281 --> 00:38:40,343
are individually discernible, but they

710
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:42,565
combine into non-trivial situations.

711
00:38:42,745 --> 00:38:44,687
And these non-trivial situations can't

712
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:47,450
be learned because they change across generations.

713
00:38:47,610 --> 00:38:49,852
Well, at least if you imagine that each combat encounter

714
00:38:50,152 --> 00:38:51,073
is a new generation.

715
00:38:51,734 --> 00:38:53,776
So an innate strategy is never possible.

716
00:38:54,355 --> 00:38:57,558
And unlike this flow experience, like in the low-level movement

717
00:38:57,598 --> 00:39:00,540
mechanics that I get to have, we can't go on autopilot

718
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,280
when playing Doom.

719
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:04,142
We always have to stay engaged, and we have to keep learning.

720
00:39:04,622 --> 00:39:05,863
And learning is actually fun.

721
00:39:07,925 --> 00:39:09,406
A more visual way of communicating

722
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,547
what I'm talking about here might be through these patterns,

723
00:39:11,607 --> 00:39:15,510
because each one is easily understandable and discernible.

724
00:39:16,030 --> 00:39:18,071
But once I start arranging these patterns

725
00:39:18,231 --> 00:39:20,133
into a specific combat configuration,

726
00:39:20,453 --> 00:39:22,835
maybe taking distance to the player into account, I get this.

727
00:39:25,049 --> 00:39:30,211
The patterns are still clearly discernible, but as they overlay, they become harder to make out.

728
00:39:30,892 --> 00:39:32,813
They do offer specific points of attack.

729
00:39:32,853 --> 00:39:35,094
There's one here, probably, where the overlap happens.

730
00:39:35,114 --> 00:39:37,736
There's one here, and it looks like there's a really good one over here.

731
00:39:38,656 --> 00:39:41,278
But, of course, combat itself is fluid. It's dynamic.

732
00:39:41,318 --> 00:39:43,579
I keep moving around, switching weapons, and so on.

733
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:46,220
So, once the player starts interacting by doing this...

734
00:39:52,339 --> 00:39:53,240
something like this happens.

735
00:39:53,320 --> 00:39:54,960
The patterns rearrange themselves.

736
00:39:55,641 --> 00:39:57,682
And the player actually has agency over that as well.

737
00:39:57,722 --> 00:39:59,463
The player kind of turns into a DJ.

738
00:39:59,923 --> 00:40:02,604
Like, the player can actually scrub the patterns

739
00:40:02,684 --> 00:40:04,886
and find specific new ways of attack.

740
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:06,546
If I'd had Flash for this,

741
00:40:06,607 --> 00:40:09,968
I could have done a really cool animation on this, right?

742
00:40:10,068 --> 00:40:12,069
But it's just a metaphor anyway,

743
00:40:12,109 --> 00:40:13,930
but if you played Doom or you remember this,

744
00:40:13,990 --> 00:40:14,931
this probably rings true.

745
00:40:15,653 --> 00:40:17,875
Because if you remember all of the gameplay systems,

746
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,657
there were things like enemy infighting.

747
00:40:19,717 --> 00:40:22,679
So I actively tried to trigger that by lining up enemies

748
00:40:22,759 --> 00:40:23,520
very specifically.

749
00:40:23,540 --> 00:40:25,642
And I was scrubbing the patterns to align themselves

750
00:40:25,722 --> 00:40:26,443
just the right way.

751
00:40:26,963 --> 00:40:28,304
There's weapon differentiation.

752
00:40:28,324 --> 00:40:30,686
So I keep switching weapons depending on enemy types

753
00:40:30,746 --> 00:40:31,327
and on distance.

754
00:40:31,867 --> 00:40:33,969
And that's something that was called the pain chance,

755
00:40:34,489 --> 00:40:37,631
where select monsters can be kept from ever actually shooting at you

756
00:40:38,511 --> 00:40:40,132
if you keep needling them with bullets.

757
00:40:40,473 --> 00:40:44,395
Because the cacodemon, I know exactly, had a 90% pain chance.

758
00:40:44,515 --> 00:40:48,598
So the chances of him getting a shot off were really, really small.

759
00:40:48,958 --> 00:40:50,519
So I'd actually use that to my advantage.

760
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:53,921
I would position myself so that the cacodemon was occluding all the hitscanners

761
00:40:54,461 --> 00:40:56,062
on the opposite end of the map.

762
00:40:56,482 --> 00:40:57,863
So now he was this living shield

763
00:40:57,923 --> 00:41:00,285
as he was getting riddled with bullets from both sides.

764
00:41:04,581 --> 00:41:07,142
So that's kind of my analysis what Doom was all about.

765
00:41:07,202 --> 00:41:09,303
If you played the game, all of this might ring true.

766
00:41:09,743 --> 00:41:11,524
Depending on how much you played the game

767
00:41:11,624 --> 00:41:13,344
or when you last played it, some of this

768
00:41:13,385 --> 00:41:14,985
might have been some small aha moments.

769
00:41:16,186 --> 00:41:18,407
But Doom did all of this, as I said,

770
00:41:18,467 --> 00:41:22,948
because it afforded what I call this prioritization choice,

771
00:41:23,429 --> 00:41:26,030
which means that prioritization is possible.

772
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:30,448
There are multiple ways to prioritize, so there's choice between how I do it.

773
00:41:30,989 --> 00:41:34,296
And choices are roughly equally weighed, so that the player has options

774
00:41:34,636 --> 00:41:37,462
and is able to actually have an opinion on each combat encounter.

775
00:41:39,417 --> 00:41:40,898
And what all this means, the result

776
00:41:40,958 --> 00:41:42,999
is that there's no clearly superior combat

777
00:41:43,039 --> 00:41:45,180
script which exists for the entire game, which

778
00:41:45,220 --> 00:41:46,020
keeps it interesting.

779
00:41:46,520 --> 00:41:48,782
Now, there's also something that it's not, right?

780
00:41:48,942 --> 00:41:51,703
Prioritization choice does not mean

781
00:41:52,163 --> 00:41:54,024
that it's a free-for-all of approaches.

782
00:41:54,084 --> 00:41:56,905
We're not trying to create tons and tons of trivial choices.

783
00:41:57,826 --> 00:41:59,767
Like, how these choices are differentiated

784
00:41:59,827 --> 00:42:01,327
still needs to be meaningful as well.

785
00:42:01,867 --> 00:42:04,349
And I'll talk a little bit later about how we author it,

786
00:42:04,449 --> 00:42:06,670
but I think it kind of happens automatically.

787
00:42:08,467 --> 00:42:12,068
There's actually one more thing here as what it's not, but I'll get to that in just a bit.

788
00:42:12,428 --> 00:42:16,269
Let me just figure out why prioritization choice, I always pick this one word,

789
00:42:16,309 --> 00:42:18,990
where I just completely let this every talk.

790
00:42:19,210 --> 00:42:22,071
But so let's figure out why prioritization choice is meaningful.

791
00:42:22,091 --> 00:42:28,874
And the short answer is it's meaningful to us because it makes the player an active participant

792
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:32,675
in how combat shapes out. It satisfies autonomy needs.

793
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:36,332
And autonomy is actually a little bit trickier than talking about competence,

794
00:42:36,392 --> 00:42:38,793
because it's not just what you might think, which is freedom.

795
00:42:38,853 --> 00:42:41,874
It's not about just allowing to do whatever, like those rats.

796
00:42:43,475 --> 00:42:45,516
Autonomy is actually about choice and opportunity.

797
00:42:46,556 --> 00:42:50,558
It reflects our innate desire to take actions out of personal volition,

798
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:53,539
and not because we're controlled by circumstances or by others.

799
00:42:54,267 --> 00:42:58,028
It's an incredibly powerful psychological need, probably more so than competence,

800
00:42:58,388 --> 00:43:00,228
because, well, we don't like being controlled.

801
00:43:01,409 --> 00:43:05,229
Which actually brings me back to this last point of what prioritization choice is not.

802
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:08,670
It is not a way to force enemies on the player.

803
00:43:09,210 --> 00:43:10,791
Because autonomy is a fickle thing.

804
00:43:11,051 --> 00:43:14,791
Just like its fulfillment can really improve enjoyment of an activity,

805
00:43:14,831 --> 00:43:18,072
if you stomp on it, it can severely damage motivation.

806
00:43:18,934 --> 00:43:27,005
There's actually tons of research on that, which you might have heard about in the general domain of extrinsic motivation and achievements and so on.

807
00:43:27,045 --> 00:43:36,877
Honestly, as game players, we can probably easily just identify with the sentiment because we play games because we don't like being controlled by circumstance or by other.

808
00:43:37,849 --> 00:43:39,431
And so, we need to be a little bit careful.

809
00:43:39,532 --> 00:43:42,616
Well, we don't like being controlled in a combat encounter, I might argue,

810
00:43:42,656 --> 00:43:45,680
because if authoritative enemy scripting creates something

811
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:49,426
where wave after wave of enemies arrives in exactly the same way,

812
00:43:50,026 --> 00:43:52,991
checkpoint restart after checkpoint restart as I die...

813
00:43:53,863 --> 00:43:59,586
That sucks. I mean, that's a pattern which, you know, is not really something that's interesting to me.

814
00:44:00,306 --> 00:44:03,308
Gotta take this with a grain of salt, of course. It's not an absolute rule.

815
00:44:03,388 --> 00:44:08,770
I'm not saying that we shouldn't use attention grabbers like charging enemies to spice up an encounter, right?

816
00:44:08,830 --> 00:44:12,752
I'm just saying that we cannot spoon-feed enemies via too authoritative scripting.

817
00:44:15,913 --> 00:44:19,955
So, prioritization choice is meaningful because it satisfies autonomy needs

818
00:44:20,095 --> 00:44:23,617
and because it creates an environment that looks exactly like the sweet spot right here.

819
00:44:27,729 --> 00:44:30,431
And Doom has really strong systemic agency

820
00:44:30,491 --> 00:44:32,672
because I can actually put those two things together.

821
00:44:32,692 --> 00:44:35,434
I have my low-level ability to master skill checks,

822
00:44:35,835 --> 00:44:39,577
and I add an autonomy level on top of it via OUD.

823
00:44:40,058 --> 00:44:43,380
We add autonomy to what at first glance is a linear game.

824
00:44:43,540 --> 00:44:45,622
Even though the way you go through the game

825
00:44:45,662 --> 00:44:48,324
looks exactly the same on a 2D map,

826
00:44:48,404 --> 00:44:50,706
the way I can play it is going to be very different

827
00:44:51,326 --> 00:44:53,148
as I'm playing through it again and again and again.

828
00:44:54,233 --> 00:44:58,535
So finally, the reason why all of this is meaningful to us is because good systemic agency,

829
00:44:58,635 --> 00:45:02,557
once I put all of this together, creates meaning because we get to learn like kids.

830
00:45:02,877 --> 00:45:04,498
We are a constructivist approach.

831
00:45:06,079 --> 00:45:08,300
This is pretty much what Piaget was talking about, right?

832
00:45:08,360 --> 00:45:12,342
It's just this idea that the amount of information that I get to learn in combat,

833
00:45:12,422 --> 00:45:15,584
in a game that has this really big possibility space, is so diverse

834
00:45:15,944 --> 00:45:19,266
that we're constantly assimilating or accommodating new information.

835
00:45:19,406 --> 00:45:21,447
We constantly update our mental models.

836
00:45:21,807 --> 00:45:22,748
Things don't get stale.

837
00:45:24,128 --> 00:45:28,374
So I would be remiss if once again I didn't talk about how we actually offer for all of this.

838
00:45:28,494 --> 00:45:33,400
Like how do we ensure that this level of systemic agency I'm talking about here is actually created.

839
00:45:33,841 --> 00:45:39,288
Now, I could probably buckle down and do math furiously.

840
00:45:40,550 --> 00:45:43,813
I could try to take all of the meaningful combinations,

841
00:45:43,953 --> 00:45:46,775
or figure out the number of all the meaningful combinations

842
00:45:46,835 --> 00:45:49,377
by tallying up all of the different core mechanics

843
00:45:49,457 --> 00:45:50,738
of the game and of the system.

844
00:45:50,798 --> 00:45:53,300
And then I could figure out all the combinations, permutations,

845
00:45:53,360 --> 00:45:55,582
binomial probabilities of the game.

846
00:45:55,622 --> 00:45:58,464
And it just sounds like design masturbation, doesn't it?

847
00:45:58,724 --> 00:46:01,686
I've never actually done this in my professional career

848
00:46:01,726 --> 00:46:04,208
beyond sets with small cardinality.

849
00:46:05,189 --> 00:46:05,629
I don't, yeah.

850
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:10,676
If you really want to dive into this, there's a rabbit hole you can go down.

851
00:46:11,056 --> 00:46:16,062
You can look up the topic of computational complexity and you can look at how our minds actually have a preference

852
00:46:16,522 --> 00:46:21,809
for games which are PSPACE complete, which is like a certain computational problem with certain...

853
00:46:23,430 --> 00:46:25,470
computers which can solve it.

854
00:46:25,690 --> 00:46:28,311
Ralph Costa talked about this in his last GDC Next lecture,

855
00:46:28,351 --> 00:46:29,791
so if you want to look at it, that's great.

856
00:46:29,831 --> 00:46:33,752
But to me, I think I'm going to be much, much simpler in my advice.

857
00:46:33,792 --> 00:46:36,452
I'm going to tell you that you simply have to follow the rules

858
00:46:36,492 --> 00:46:39,373
that we've already laid out. It was all there the entire time.

859
00:46:40,453 --> 00:46:42,633
You have to ensure that the enemies are differentiated

860
00:46:42,693 --> 00:46:45,514
across a scale that's clearly defined on each end,

861
00:46:46,694 --> 00:46:49,435
and those should be opposed in some shape or form, ideally.

862
00:46:50,086 --> 00:46:53,767
You have to make sure that each system has a clearly understood frame and script,

863
00:46:55,507 --> 00:46:58,548
so that you create clearly discernible patterns out of all of this.

864
00:46:58,888 --> 00:47:01,749
And then you need to make sure that, well, the game controls really well,

865
00:47:01,929 --> 00:47:04,710
and your signs and feedback are clear and unambiguous.

866
00:47:05,170 --> 00:47:07,251
There's no question when this guy is dying, right?

867
00:47:07,771 --> 00:47:10,071
Just like, like, it doesn't matter if it's a cover shooter,

868
00:47:10,091 --> 00:47:12,152
where you could just go back behind cover, he's dead.

869
00:47:13,072 --> 00:47:15,073
And then the way I usually test this is something,

870
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:17,993
the super scientific method of what I call the checkpoint test.

871
00:47:18,702 --> 00:47:21,624
It's this idea that I can simply play the encounter multiple times,

872
00:47:21,744 --> 00:47:24,006
imagining that I had died multiple times,

873
00:47:24,626 --> 00:47:27,568
and I see if the patterns rearrange themselves meaningfully different

874
00:47:27,588 --> 00:47:28,809
to where I actually feel like,

875
00:47:29,009 --> 00:47:32,091
let me try that again because there's got to be a better way or a different way

876
00:47:32,151 --> 00:47:33,933
this time to figure this out.

877
00:47:34,773 --> 00:47:37,235
And if you do all of this, then you create this mystical cream

878
00:47:37,395 --> 00:47:38,776
that I was talking about in 2012.

879
00:47:39,577 --> 00:47:40,878
You get to fill your game with cream,

880
00:47:41,218 --> 00:47:44,080
which we didn't do in Unreal 2 at that point, as you might remember.

881
00:47:45,017 --> 00:47:49,759
So, there's an entire list here which I'm gonna kind of skip over because I feel like I explained most of them.

882
00:47:50,179 --> 00:47:53,960
The highlights pretty much are this. You need to ensure that your three C's are top-notch,

883
00:47:54,260 --> 00:47:57,281
because we can't feel competent if we can't control the game.

884
00:47:57,301 --> 00:48:00,121
You need to make sure that you have very clear science and feedback,

885
00:48:00,382 --> 00:48:04,883
because they actually create agency at the lowest level, and that's vital to a feeling of competence.

886
00:48:05,564 --> 00:48:07,946
And you need to create clearly understood systems.

887
00:48:08,206 --> 00:48:10,108
And weapons are part of this as well, right?

888
00:48:10,128 --> 00:48:11,369
Like there's a whole nother talk where

889
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:13,812
we can look at weapon design and how that is meaningfully

890
00:48:13,852 --> 00:48:14,592
differentiated.

891
00:48:15,073 --> 00:48:17,575
And why there's a reason we only have like four or five weapon

892
00:48:17,635 --> 00:48:18,977
types across all games.

893
00:48:19,657 --> 00:48:21,459
And everything else, once again, to me

894
00:48:21,499 --> 00:48:23,100
is design masturbation, because telling me,

895
00:48:23,120 --> 00:48:24,942
yeah, you can create your custom weapon,

896
00:48:24,982 --> 00:48:26,984
just create system soup in the middle somewhere there.

897
00:48:27,385 --> 00:48:28,085
That's a different talk.

898
00:48:29,066 --> 00:48:31,827
I talked about it in terms of enemies and that's what you need to do.

899
00:48:32,008 --> 00:48:34,249
Make sure they're orthogonally differentiated,

900
00:48:34,609 --> 00:48:38,171
because that creates the potential for some sort of prioritization choice.

901
00:48:39,251 --> 00:48:42,293
And I hope after all of this, I don't really have to go into much detail

902
00:48:42,333 --> 00:48:46,635
as to why Dead Space 2 is made from exactly the same cloth as Doom.

903
00:48:47,229 --> 00:48:48,571
Well, unless he didn't play the games.

904
00:48:48,651 --> 00:48:55,218
But Dead Space 2 has a cast of differentiated characters with very distinct frames and scripts,

905
00:48:55,638 --> 00:48:58,581
good silhouettes as well, so I can immediately tell who is who.

906
00:48:59,462 --> 00:49:02,545
And there's actually, they're differentiated across enemies that rush

907
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,487
and enemies that are shooting at me from behind.

908
00:49:05,088 --> 00:49:07,911
And then it actually does something which pretty much no other game does,

909
00:49:08,011 --> 00:49:11,235
it embeds meaningful choice right inside each enemy type as well,

910
00:49:11,275 --> 00:49:14,018
because you get to dismember all of these necromorphs.

911
00:49:14,218 --> 00:49:15,760
And you can do that in multiple places,

912
00:49:15,820 --> 00:49:18,342
and depending on where you do it, you actually get different reactions.

913
00:49:19,123 --> 00:49:20,285
So there's meaningful choice there,

914
00:49:20,725 --> 00:49:24,189
plus you get a wide variety of differentiated weapons

915
00:49:24,209 --> 00:49:26,591
that also have very specific profiles and behavior.

916
00:49:27,157 --> 00:49:30,178
So Dead Space 3 actually creates prioritization choice

917
00:49:30,258 --> 00:49:30,998
on multiple levels.

918
00:49:31,478 --> 00:49:34,219
Via enemy dismemberment, enemy prioritization,

919
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:35,939
and via weapon choice as well.

920
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:39,060
And then it adds some systems like stasis on top of it,

921
00:49:39,080 --> 00:49:40,601
where the player then becomes the DJ

922
00:49:40,641 --> 00:49:41,841
and he gets to scrub around

923
00:49:41,921 --> 00:49:44,202
and like exactly which pattern he wants to create

924
00:49:44,542 --> 00:49:45,402
and who he wants to freeze.

925
00:49:47,182 --> 00:49:49,183
So maybe I told you something new.

926
00:49:49,723 --> 00:49:51,243
Maybe I told you yesterday's news

927
00:49:51,403 --> 00:49:53,704
because you feel like all games do this to some degree.

928
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:56,505
I don't think we're doing it enough.

929
00:49:57,283 --> 00:50:00,164
And we might not even know exactly what we got when we are doing it.

930
00:50:00,505 --> 00:50:03,025
And that's why I called Unreal 2 such a big disappointment in 2012.

931
00:50:03,385 --> 00:50:07,627
And the ironic part actually is that I was constantly talking about Doom.

932
00:50:07,727 --> 00:50:11,528
We made Unreal 2 in 2000, like 1999-2000.

933
00:50:11,568 --> 00:50:14,629
So I was constantly talking about Doom and how awesome it was,

934
00:50:15,009 --> 00:50:18,350
and then I didn't actually have the tools to convert any of that knowledge into gameplay.

935
00:50:19,714 --> 00:50:23,796
But I feel that even when you do have differentiated enemy types,

936
00:50:23,836 --> 00:50:25,397
there are quite a few games that do that.

937
00:50:25,458 --> 00:50:27,719
You have the shotgunner, you have the sniper, and so on.

938
00:50:27,739 --> 00:50:30,801
There are still quite a few games that then fail the checkpoint test

939
00:50:30,841 --> 00:50:34,083
because they're way too authoritative in how they dish out those enemies.

940
00:50:34,663 --> 00:50:39,606
Maybe they don't have the systemic depth to support systemic behavior, systemic combat.

941
00:50:40,591 --> 00:50:42,694
Or maybe that's just what the designers are doing.

942
00:50:42,734 --> 00:50:45,157
But ultimately, my feeling for autonomy

943
00:50:45,197 --> 00:50:46,459
is then stomped upon.

944
00:50:46,539 --> 00:50:48,001
And if I don't die in the game, it's

945
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:49,202
going to be an awesome experience.

946
00:50:49,542 --> 00:50:50,904
But that's just because I don't know what's missing.

947
00:50:52,426 --> 00:50:53,548
What are some games that do it right?

948
00:50:53,608 --> 00:50:55,710
Well, Halo is the big one, right?

949
00:50:57,096 --> 00:50:59,017
And I don't even know how much I have to say about it.

950
00:50:59,057 --> 00:51:02,139
There are differentiated enemies across strength and behavior

951
00:51:02,179 --> 00:51:03,380
with very clear silhouettes.

952
00:51:03,720 --> 00:51:04,641
There are enemy weapons.

953
00:51:04,701 --> 00:51:05,742
There are hitscan weapons.

954
00:51:05,802 --> 00:51:08,604
There's this interplay between power takedown shields

955
00:51:08,644 --> 00:51:10,325
and energy and so on.

956
00:51:10,765 --> 00:51:12,406
And they actually add something which I don't think

957
00:51:12,426 --> 00:51:15,368
gets a lot of credit for being a design innovation instead

958
00:51:15,388 --> 00:51:18,270
of just a controller limitation, which was weapon churn.

959
00:51:19,571 --> 00:51:22,432
Like, back when Halo came out, it was the first mainstream game

960
00:51:22,452 --> 00:51:24,593
where you could only have two weapons at the same time.

961
00:51:25,053 --> 00:51:28,654
And that wasn't because they... well, maybe it was also because they couldn't have a big inventory,

962
00:51:29,014 --> 00:51:32,536
but really, it was constantly forcing you to make meaningful choice

963
00:51:32,596 --> 00:51:35,517
about what kind of weapon you were taking into the next part of combat.

964
00:51:35,937 --> 00:51:40,278
And if you failed a checkpoint, well, how you would approach the combat the next time you played it.

965
00:51:40,939 --> 00:51:43,940
It's absolutely no accident that the reason I know about this book,

966
00:51:43,980 --> 00:51:46,000
the one you should read, is via Jamie Griesemer,

967
00:51:46,040 --> 00:51:49,002
who was the lead designer on Halo for the first, I think, three games.

968
00:51:50,003 --> 00:51:51,345
I think Batman is really good.

969
00:51:52,225 --> 00:51:54,307
It creates all these small gameplay molecules

970
00:51:54,347 --> 00:51:55,848
with differentiated enemy types.

971
00:51:56,829 --> 00:51:59,351
So as I'm interacting with one of these bubbles of combat,

972
00:51:59,811 --> 00:52:01,613
I get into the slow state of combat.

973
00:52:01,653 --> 00:52:04,375
And then I'm actually trying to prioritize or just avoid guys

974
00:52:04,415 --> 00:52:05,456
as well at that lower level.

975
00:52:06,056 --> 00:52:07,778
And when somebody is picking up a weapon,

976
00:52:07,818 --> 00:52:09,379
I'm trying to go for him, and so on.

977
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:11,661
So that's all happening through exactly what

978
00:52:11,681 --> 00:52:12,441
we're talking about here.

979
00:52:13,142 --> 00:52:15,264
And then I guess Star Wars 1332 did it pretty well.

980
00:52:15,524 --> 00:52:17,265
And I can't put any slides up here.

981
00:52:18,607 --> 00:52:22,390
But I feel like the OUD in our game, which was a cover shooter, was actually quite good,

982
00:52:22,470 --> 00:52:28,474
where with just four enemy archetypes we were actually able to get something that didn't fail a checkpoint test,

983
00:52:28,594 --> 00:52:31,356
because we had enemies with clearly discernible behaviors,

984
00:52:31,796 --> 00:52:34,758
where I could have an opinion on what would happen.

985
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,281
I knew this guy would charge me. I knew this guy would be throwing grenades.

986
00:52:38,641 --> 00:52:40,862
I knew this guy would not stop for anything,

987
00:52:40,903 --> 00:52:43,985
but I had a certain weapon that I could use to slow him down, and so on.

988
00:52:44,684 --> 00:52:49,627
So, that for me is just the way I've been trying to apply all of these lessons to the way I'm making games.

989
00:52:49,647 --> 00:52:56,931
I'm going to let you stare at this picture for a little bit longer.

990
00:52:57,712 --> 00:53:03,896
It's actually the perfect symbol for a decision that's meaningful in nature.

991
00:53:03,916 --> 00:53:06,978
I just had to cut the about 20 slides that explain it.

992
00:53:07,607 --> 00:53:13,851
But if you want to know how the weed warbler has to make a really meaningful choice that can predict when a cuckoo egg is in its nest or not,

993
00:53:13,871 --> 00:53:15,812
I might put it in the slide downloads.

994
00:53:16,433 --> 00:53:19,634
But there used to be a time when everybody in the industry had played Doom.

995
00:53:19,654 --> 00:53:21,396
That was pretty much the baseline, right?

996
00:53:21,436 --> 00:53:25,558
So there wasn't any question about, like, what it does and what it is and what it isn't.

997
00:53:26,278 --> 00:53:28,640
And that won't be the case anymore very soon.

998
00:53:29,660 --> 00:53:32,362
And that means it's up to all of us to actually continue that tradition.

999
00:53:33,176 --> 00:53:35,739
We have to continue to make games that take its place, right?

1000
00:53:35,779 --> 00:53:38,982
Because we have to create a new generation of game and level designers that understand

1001
00:53:39,402 --> 00:53:44,627
simply by playing the game, the virtues of good gameplay, and creating this kind of systemic agency.

1002
00:53:45,488 --> 00:53:47,430
Now this may have been a systems design talk.

1003
00:53:48,030 --> 00:53:49,071
Probably was. It was.

1004
00:53:49,606 --> 00:53:51,967
But the fact that I learned all of this through level design

1005
00:53:52,047 --> 00:53:55,289
is incredibly important to me, because being a level designer

1006
00:53:55,389 --> 00:53:57,811
on a really good game with low-level systems

1007
00:53:57,871 --> 00:53:59,132
made me a better game designer.

1008
00:53:59,772 --> 00:54:02,354
Working as a level designer in Doom was incredibly fun.

1009
00:54:02,874 --> 00:54:04,555
It actually still required a lot of thought.

1010
00:54:04,595 --> 00:54:06,876
It's not like you just randomly distributed enemies.

1011
00:54:06,896 --> 00:54:09,438
It's just that you had so many choices

1012
00:54:09,478 --> 00:54:12,340
in how you played the possibility space

1013
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:14,641
and just kind of distributed it across the map,

1014
00:54:15,362 --> 00:54:18,463
and in how you then formed the entire environment around that.

1015
00:54:20,015 --> 00:54:22,438
Being a level designer on Dead Space was actually very similar,

1016
00:54:22,458 --> 00:54:25,623
because in Dead Space, the systemic agency is so high

1017
00:54:25,683 --> 00:54:27,506
that I can create a compelling encounter

1018
00:54:27,886 --> 00:54:30,050
by just putting three slashers in a room, which

1019
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:30,851
is the base enemy.

1020
00:54:31,559 --> 00:54:33,800
Because they're all going to advance at me and they're going to kill me.

1021
00:54:33,820 --> 00:54:34,920
There's no question about that.

1022
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:36,541
So I'm going to stasis the first guy.

1023
00:54:36,561 --> 00:54:41,122
I'm going to try to take off the legs of the second guy so that he doesn't get to me.

1024
00:54:41,142 --> 00:54:43,603
I'm going to kill the third guy just as he gets to me.

1025
00:54:43,643 --> 00:54:47,004
At that point, the first guy who isn't in stasis anymore is starting to charge me now.

1026
00:54:47,404 --> 00:54:50,625
Oh, and oops, I missed and I actually took off somebody's head and now those guys are charging me.

1027
00:54:51,435 --> 00:54:55,316
And if just that as a base encounter is something that's inherently interesting,

1028
00:54:55,336 --> 00:54:57,916
then just imagine what you get to do on top of that

1029
00:54:57,976 --> 00:54:59,997
by combining all of these different enemy types

1030
00:55:00,057 --> 00:55:01,697
and actually scripting combat around that.

1031
00:55:02,377 --> 00:55:05,278
So I didn't actually do any of this. I'm not taking credit for it, right?

1032
00:55:05,398 --> 00:55:08,979
I was just a level designer applying that possibility space.

1033
00:55:10,299 --> 00:55:11,980
I got to be, this is what I said in 2012,

1034
00:55:12,280 --> 00:55:14,300
I got to be a guide to the possibility space.

1035
00:55:14,320 --> 00:55:16,841
I got to make guide of a new gameplay situations from the game

1036
00:55:17,301 --> 00:55:20,902
because the actual underlying systems were very simple and clearly delineated.

1037
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:26,004
I don't know if you guys saw this Kotaku article, which just came out like a few days ago.

1038
00:55:26,044 --> 00:55:26,984
It just made me chuckle.

1039
00:55:27,545 --> 00:55:33,970
Here were gamers surprised, how to HD even, to find that maybe there's a reason why enemies in games are dumb and predictable.

1040
00:55:34,585 --> 00:55:36,287
Well, no, they're dumb and predictable.

1041
00:55:36,387 --> 00:55:41,592
I hope you understand this because games are the antidote for life that is too chaotic.

1042
00:55:41,712 --> 00:55:44,334
Life is over there and games clearly live here.

1043
00:55:44,354 --> 00:55:48,778
It doesn't mean we can't advance in a whole bunch of interesting and meaningful ways there,

1044
00:55:49,079 --> 00:55:53,523
but ultimately there's a reason why all of these things are very easily categorized and

1045
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,804
are kind of stereotypes.

1046
00:55:55,925 --> 00:55:58,968
Life is, however, orthogonally differentiated.

1047
00:55:59,008 --> 00:56:00,109
It might be incredibly...

1048
00:56:00,495 --> 00:56:10,397
chaotic, but there is a clear choice that I get to make, right? I get to make the choice whether I wanted to be a biologist or a game designer, and I didn't have the benefits of safe games or checkpoints.

1049
00:56:10,997 --> 00:56:23,939
So in life, choices matter just because they matter. I know I made the correct one, right? I don't regret the choice of becoming a game designer one bit, I just realized that just like in life, game design is uncomfortably chaotic.

1050
00:56:24,039 --> 00:56:29,640
It's really hard to find patterns of good game design in there. It's very intuitive.

1051
00:56:30,391 --> 00:56:33,233
Now we have to remember, just in game design, just like in life,

1052
00:56:33,453 --> 00:56:34,954
things only appear to be random.

1053
00:56:34,974 --> 00:56:36,575
There actually are patterns in there,

1054
00:56:36,795 --> 00:56:37,936
which is why we're searching for them,

1055
00:56:38,236 --> 00:56:40,098
which is why all of you are coming to GDC.

1056
00:56:40,478 --> 00:56:43,680
We're searching for patterns to bring some order to the chaos,

1057
00:56:43,780 --> 00:56:44,861
which is game development.

1058
00:56:45,421 --> 00:56:46,782
Now in this talk, I tried to figure out

1059
00:56:46,822 --> 00:56:49,024
why action shooters like Doom, at the low level,

1060
00:56:49,064 --> 00:56:51,846
at the core level, are inherently meaningful to us.

1061
00:56:51,946 --> 00:56:54,708
And that's because there's some puzzle box with just

1062
00:56:54,728 --> 00:56:55,748
the right amount of danger.

1063
00:56:57,296 --> 00:56:58,897
And that's via systemic agency, which

1064
00:56:58,957 --> 00:57:00,838
is the one specific pattern which

1065
00:57:00,878 --> 00:57:01,718
I want to present to you.

1066
00:57:02,198 --> 00:57:03,879
I hope it actually came through clear.

1067
00:57:04,299 --> 00:57:05,260
I hope you found it useful.

1068
00:57:05,320 --> 00:57:07,221
And I hope that as you go into the main conference,

1069
00:57:07,801 --> 00:57:10,142
you find a whole bunch of other patterns that you can apply.

1070
00:57:10,762 --> 00:57:13,144
So thank you for coming today from all of us.

1071
00:57:13,824 --> 00:57:14,184
And that's me.
