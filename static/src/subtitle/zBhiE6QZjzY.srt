00:00:04,217 --> 00:00:07,978
Hello everybody, welcome to the Independent Games Summit.

2
00:00:08,299 --> 00:00:16,543
I am happy to introduce Tomas Grip, directly from Sweden, and he's going to tell us about

3
00:00:16,643 --> 00:00:17,443
Amnesia and...

4
00:00:18,624 --> 00:00:19,524
Mostly Amnesia, I guess.

5
00:00:19,724 --> 00:00:19,944
Yes.

6
00:00:20,204 --> 00:00:20,404
Okay.

7
00:00:21,905 --> 00:00:23,806
Yeah, so, hi everybody.

8
00:00:24,006 --> 00:00:30,849
So as has been said, I am Tomas Grip, and I'm one of the founders of Frictional Games.

9
00:00:31,637 --> 00:00:36,080
For ten years now I've been working on various horror game projects.

10
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:43,726
The first five I've mainly done homebrew stuff and for the last five I've been involved in

11
00:00:43,766 --> 00:00:45,147
various commercial projects.

12
00:00:45,807 --> 00:00:51,811
These commercial projects include games such as the Pramana series and now most recently

13
00:00:51,891 --> 00:00:56,555
Amnesia the Dark Descent, which is the game that this lecture will sort of focus on.

14
00:00:57,784 --> 00:01:03,585
Now, the reason why I'm so interested in horror games is because it's one of the only genres

15
00:01:03,806 --> 00:01:07,586
in games that focus on evoking emotions.

16
00:01:07,646 --> 00:01:10,487
It's perhaps the only genre in games that does this.

17
00:01:10,847 --> 00:01:17,389
Even commercial projects, they can throw away more normal game stuff that you have in order

18
00:01:17,449 --> 00:01:20,550
to get close into this horror atmosphere.

19
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:25,211
And horror games is not really even a gameplay style, genre.

20
00:01:26,731 --> 00:01:30,294
Most of the horror games you see are action-adventure type of affairs,

21
00:01:30,434 --> 00:01:34,677
but I don't see any problem with a strategy game being a horror game

22
00:01:34,997 --> 00:01:38,919
as long as you have this kind of horror response to it.

23
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,043
Now, this focus on evoking emotion is something that has been very evident

24
00:01:45,163 --> 00:01:48,326
in the development of Amnesia, The Dark Descent.

25
00:01:49,724 --> 00:01:55,366
And we had to have this really strict goal that we should have a strong horror emotion,

26
00:01:55,526 --> 00:01:57,907
more than in any other game we have made before.

27
00:01:58,328 --> 00:02:03,990
And because of this, I think that Amnesia is very well the best game we have made so far.

28
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:09,732
And press response that we have had for the game seems to confirm this.

29
00:02:10,212 --> 00:02:12,033
For example, Rock Paper Shotgun says,

30
00:02:12,113 --> 00:02:17,295
I think it's safe to say that Amnesia is the most successfully frightening game to have been made.

31
00:02:18,256 --> 00:02:23,381
And the game informer says if Resident Evil is alien, Amnesia is alien.

32
00:02:24,834 --> 00:02:32,160
And we have also, apart from getting these good words from people, we have sold over 400,000 units.

33
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:39,946
And this is without any real PR. We have only relied on word of mouth and the press response, as you just saw.

34
00:02:40,266 --> 00:02:43,109
And this is for a niche game, like a horror game.

35
00:02:43,629 --> 00:02:49,634
And on top of all this, we have actually gotten quite the reputation of being THE scary game.

36
00:02:49,934 --> 00:02:51,856
Now, here's some example from the Internet.

37
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:54,158
Here you have the scared pug.

38
00:02:55,679 --> 00:02:59,601
Someone who played Amnesia Dark Descent for five minutes and okay, that's close enough.

39
00:03:00,622 --> 00:03:05,484
Here's someone who drew themselves during one of the scenes in our game.

40
00:03:06,224 --> 00:03:10,586
Now, having this kind of response is really, really great.

41
00:03:10,626 --> 00:03:14,448
We're really overwhelmed with the response that we have had from this.

42
00:03:14,888 --> 00:03:17,430
Now, you can ask, why this success?

43
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:20,571
Why is Amnesia considered such a scary game?

44
00:03:20,751 --> 00:03:22,512
Now, I think this boils down to...

45
00:03:22,932 --> 00:03:24,394
three main principles.

46
00:03:24,574 --> 00:03:27,457
And during this lecture, I will go over these main principles

47
00:03:27,557 --> 00:03:29,859
and discuss them and how they came about.

48
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:32,282
And then I will also dig a little bit deeper

49
00:03:32,322 --> 00:03:34,904
and discuss what do these principles mean,

50
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:39,749
what they can tell us about game design in general.

51
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:42,412
Now, for the first part,

52
00:03:42,912 --> 00:03:44,975
where I just talk about the different decisions.

53
00:03:46,775 --> 00:03:51,076
So, the first design principle is not to use any weapons.

54
00:03:51,136 --> 00:03:56,397
In Amnesia, pretty much what the player does is either to hide or to run away from the

55
00:03:56,437 --> 00:03:57,678
monsters they encounter.

56
00:03:58,358 --> 00:04:01,239
This decision has a bit of a history to it.

57
00:04:01,299 --> 00:04:07,600
It all started out with that game, the Penumbra Tech demo, that we did in 2006, when frictional

58
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:09,061
games really didn't exist.

59
00:04:10,351 --> 00:04:13,993
a bit due to design, but I guess mainly due to a lack of resources.

60
00:04:14,033 --> 00:04:15,693
We didn't have any combat in that game.

61
00:04:16,173 --> 00:04:21,796
Now, when we started our first commercial game, Penumbra Overture, overwhelming player

62
00:04:21,836 --> 00:04:24,157
response said, you must have weapons in your game.

63
00:04:24,517 --> 00:04:26,658
So we thought, this makes sense.

64
00:04:27,058 --> 00:04:33,301
It's a very common horror trope that the protagonist has as a last line of defense, picks up whatever

65
00:04:33,321 --> 00:04:38,643
is around and use that to fend the enemy or the monsters or whatever away.

66
00:04:39,624 --> 00:04:44,845
And this is really interesting, so we thought that yeah, we must have this.

67
00:04:44,925 --> 00:04:49,926
And in Penumbra Tech Demo, what happened was that the player found all this stuff flying

68
00:04:49,986 --> 00:04:54,428
around and they can imagine themselves, oh I can pick this up and use that as a weapon.

69
00:04:54,708 --> 00:04:59,489
And we thought, okay, if you can't pick it up, then it might break the immersion of the

70
00:04:59,529 --> 00:04:59,869
game.

71
00:05:00,309 --> 00:05:03,970
So we made a combat system for Penumbra Overture.

72
00:05:04,631 --> 00:05:10,682
made it intentionally quite clumsy. Our intent was that the player should just hit an enemy

73
00:05:10,702 --> 00:05:14,629
and then run off and wait until the danger was over.

74
00:05:15,671 --> 00:05:22,594
Now, the arsenal for Penumbra Overture, it had stuff like a pretty clumsy pickaxe, a

75
00:05:22,674 --> 00:05:26,235
hammer, and a broom.

76
00:05:26,355 --> 00:05:31,198
So we went to great lengths to make sure that the weapons were not very practical.

77
00:05:31,518 --> 00:05:36,100
And on top of this, we never called them weapons items, we called them tools.

78
00:05:36,300 --> 00:05:43,143
So we made all this, we had this clumsy combat system, we had these non-practical weapons

79
00:05:46,044 --> 00:05:48,365
We had this vague naming, as I said, and we thought,

80
00:05:48,465 --> 00:05:51,286
OK, we're set, we're going to emulate this last line of defense.

81
00:05:51,986 --> 00:05:52,627
We were wrong.

82
00:05:52,647 --> 00:05:57,649
It turns out, when the player has an opportunity to kill something, they will.

83
00:05:57,669 --> 00:06:03,532
If only armed with a puny little hammer and you have this huge demonic dog charging them,

84
00:06:03,812 --> 00:06:09,034
the player will just go to straight attack and try and bash the brains out of this dog.

85
00:06:09,294 --> 00:06:11,355
And now, of course, two things will happen here.

86
00:06:12,015 --> 00:06:15,737
Either the player will find some ingenious way to abuse our system,

87
00:06:15,937 --> 00:06:18,038
killing the enemy quite easily,

88
00:06:18,259 --> 00:06:21,020
and then because of this, the scariness factor goes down.

89
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,722
Or the other thing that happens is that the player will just treat it

90
00:06:24,802 --> 00:06:27,403
as your normal first-person hack and slash,

91
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:30,425
go ahead with that, and then die horribly,

92
00:06:30,685 --> 00:06:31,585
of course thinking that,

93
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,927
oh God, the combat sucked in this game, and the game sucks.

94
00:06:36,568 --> 00:06:40,950
And so, only a minority did what we thought they would do.

95
00:06:41,130 --> 00:06:41,250
So...

96
00:06:42,371 --> 00:06:51,561
The combat was failed. Now, for our next game, the follow up for Penumbra Overture Black Plague, we thought we had to mend this somehow, but how to make it work?

97
00:06:52,121 --> 00:06:56,686
The obvious thing would be, okay, Alexios fixed the combat, and we talked about this a bit.

98
00:06:57,287 --> 00:07:02,112
we can add some circle-strafing like in Zelda, or let's just, we had this mouse control,

99
00:07:02,132 --> 00:07:03,733
let's remove the mouse control.

100
00:07:04,073 --> 00:07:06,836
But the more we discuss this, we just realize that

101
00:07:07,196 --> 00:07:09,919
this is just gonna make the game into a hack and slash,

102
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,362
and that's not really what we want the game to be.

103
00:07:12,422 --> 00:07:15,985
So this time, we'll remove the weapons from the game,

104
00:07:16,506 --> 00:07:20,549
and this time, not due to lack of resources, but as a design choice.

105
00:07:21,678 --> 00:07:27,680
But now, with Combat Gun, players approach the game quite differently.

106
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:34,422
The enemies were seen as more frightening, and players started to notice other experience-wise

107
00:07:34,942 --> 00:07:36,343
more important things.

108
00:07:36,443 --> 00:07:42,125
So not only was the whole combat or the enemy encounters changed, but they changed their

109
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:47,686
entire look at the game, and this was quite a revelation for us, even so.

110
00:07:48,407 --> 00:07:50,868
the lure of having combat, it's quite strong.

111
00:07:51,008 --> 00:07:52,628
So for Amnesia, of course, we thought,

112
00:07:52,728 --> 00:07:55,129
okay, let's do a combat system for Amnesia.

113
00:07:55,429 --> 00:07:57,230
So we added a combat system,

114
00:07:57,570 --> 00:07:59,231
and then once again, we failed with it.

115
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,232
It was just too hard to balance it

116
00:08:02,272 --> 00:08:04,273
without getting this kind of response

117
00:08:04,313 --> 00:08:05,373
that we had in Overture.

118
00:08:05,993 --> 00:08:08,054
So I will talk a little bit later on

119
00:08:08,234 --> 00:08:11,315
why this lure of having combat is so strong,

120
00:08:11,355 --> 00:08:13,216
and also when you remove combat,

121
00:08:13,276 --> 00:08:16,157
why the game changes in very drastic ways.

122
00:08:17,047 --> 00:08:19,790
Now, for the next thing. No death.

123
00:08:20,491 --> 00:08:24,115
So, this may sound a bit weird for a horror game.

124
00:08:24,135 --> 00:08:32,365
Other titles in the genre have gone to great lengths to make sure that dying is really, really bad.

125
00:08:32,405 --> 00:08:34,408
You have Resident Evil, who have this...

126
00:08:35,629 --> 00:08:40,651
their ink ribbons in order to make sure that the player doesn't save it often.

127
00:08:40,671 --> 00:08:45,633
You have forbidden siren that uses, you have to repeat the entire levels.

128
00:08:46,093 --> 00:08:52,396
Now intuitively it might seem that, okay, if we have a strong penalty for the player

129
00:08:52,576 --> 00:08:57,638
whenever they die, whenever they're in a situation where they think they're going to die, they

130
00:08:57,698 --> 00:08:59,279
feel like a lot is at stake.

131
00:08:59,479 --> 00:09:04,881
Now I do agree that this is true, but only to a certain extent.

132
00:09:06,156 --> 00:09:12,098
The first time when we started thinking about this no-death thing came about with chase sequences.

133
00:09:12,438 --> 00:09:17,359
Chase sequences are very important in horror movies and in horror literature.

134
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:22,821
Having the protagonist of your story being hunted by something unknown or something scary,

135
00:09:23,121 --> 00:09:27,443
it resembles this feeling you have in nightmares when you're running but you're not going anywhere.

136
00:09:27,863 --> 00:09:30,403
So this is quite a strong emotion.

137
00:09:30,464 --> 00:09:33,725
So we knew we had to emulate this for our games somehow.

138
00:09:34,604 --> 00:09:39,048
First time we added it was in our first commercial project, Penumbra Overture.

139
00:09:39,688 --> 00:09:45,233
Turns out, 50% of the people that played it, okay, they liked it.

140
00:09:45,633 --> 00:09:49,796
50% that played it, the other half that is, they just hated it.

141
00:09:49,997 --> 00:09:55,701
So, you can ask yourselves, or we ask ourselves, what is the difference between these two groups?

142
00:09:55,861 --> 00:09:58,003
It turns out, the people that liked it...

143
00:09:59,299 --> 00:10:06,127
they've managed to complete these face sequences in one or two attempts.

144
00:10:06,147 --> 00:10:09,772
There are other people that took more tries and they didn't like it.

145
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:13,576
So, the solution to fix this is really easy.

146
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:18,262
You just don't make the player repeat it more than two times.

147
00:10:18,683 --> 00:10:25,111
In reality, this is not that easy of a design decision to make, because it means that you

148
00:10:25,171 --> 00:10:28,376
throw out the trial and error from your game.

149
00:10:29,097 --> 00:10:35,085
And trial and error is something that's seen as a good design choice in many situations.

150
00:10:36,086 --> 00:10:45,811
I remember speaking about this on the internet, and it was not uncommon for people to think when I spoke that you shouldn't have trial and error.

151
00:10:45,831 --> 00:10:49,273
They said, but trial and error is the ingredient in games.

152
00:10:49,733 --> 00:10:57,597
So I think it's fair to say that it's a wildly held belief that trial and error is a very important part of your games.

153
00:10:57,677 --> 00:11:00,459
And I admit to that, I thought this too.

154
00:11:01,319 --> 00:11:07,645
And so it shouldn't come as a surprise that when we did our Black Plague, which was the

155
00:11:07,805 --> 00:11:10,687
sequel to Penumbra Overture, we didn't fix the system.

156
00:11:10,727 --> 00:11:16,452
We have the same death mechanic, and from Niche our intent was to still have the same

157
00:11:17,073 --> 00:11:22,017
death mechanic that once you died you had to repeat the obstacle over and over again

158
00:11:22,037 --> 00:11:23,718
until you managed to overcome it.

159
00:11:25,321 --> 00:11:33,243
Now, it wasn't very late, until very late in development, half a year before Amnesia

160
00:11:33,283 --> 00:11:37,604
was to be completed, that we actually decided we shouldn't have any death.

161
00:11:37,644 --> 00:11:44,666
And this came about at the time when we thought about a lot of the design that we had in our

162
00:11:44,686 --> 00:11:44,906
game.

163
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:54,290
The design that we chose to implement in our fake death system, or fake death system I should say,

164
00:11:54,650 --> 00:12:01,472
is that the player doesn't lose any progress when dying, but they're teleported somewhere else.

165
00:12:01,633 --> 00:12:05,334
And the important part is that we changed a little bit of the level.

166
00:12:07,035 --> 00:12:12,276
When the player had died, he woke up and didn't know what to expect this time around.

167
00:12:12,336 --> 00:12:19,778
And we thought that this fear of the unknown would be enough to make the player frightened of dying.

168
00:12:19,818 --> 00:12:25,200
And also on top of this, because we changed the map, we can add additional scares.

169
00:12:25,300 --> 00:12:29,121
So let's say the player walked through a hallway, and the first time around there weren't any

170
00:12:29,141 --> 00:12:32,262
monsters, then they died later up and then they had to walk through the hallway again.

171
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,362
And then we can have some monster hiding around.

172
00:12:34,442 --> 00:12:38,927
I kept popping up through a corner this time, and that made a great effect because the player,

173
00:12:39,107 --> 00:12:42,370
you can have revitalized the section of the game.

174
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:50,218
Now that we implemented it, it worked out way better than expected.

175
00:12:50,238 --> 00:12:56,865
Amnesia is filled with all these chase sequences, but yet nobody, as I know about, has complained

176
00:12:56,925 --> 00:12:58,246
about these chase sequences.

177
00:12:58,987 --> 00:13:01,669
And this is quite the thing.

178
00:13:01,969 --> 00:13:07,394
And even if they actually figured out the system, they figured out that if I die, it

179
00:13:07,434 --> 00:13:10,097
doesn't really matter, they still thought it was scary.

180
00:13:10,317 --> 00:13:15,802
Some people even thought it was scarier once they figured out that the system helped them

181
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:19,886
along because they thought, okay, the game takes care of me, then I can focus on being

182
00:13:19,946 --> 00:13:22,208
immersed in the game instead.

183
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:28,032
Keep in mind that this system could really easily be exploited.

184
00:13:28,292 --> 00:13:33,335
So, let's say the player faces an enemy, it can just run up against it and die each time

185
00:13:33,375 --> 00:13:37,037
and eventually they would manage to overcome the obstacle.

186
00:13:37,277 --> 00:13:39,378
But yet, pretty much no one did this.

187
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:45,542
And I think this is amazing, considering how slapped on and rushed this sort of mechanic was.

188
00:13:45,923 --> 00:13:47,063
It wasn't until the half...

189
00:13:47,764 --> 00:13:52,127
last half year that we implemented this and we had tons of other stuff to do at that time.

190
00:13:52,468 --> 00:13:57,112
So the events we added and the changes we made, they were all quite rushed.

191
00:13:58,453 --> 00:14:03,377
Now on to the final design principle, no competitive mechanics.

192
00:14:04,044 --> 00:14:11,107
What I mean by no competitive mechanics is game systems that instead of setting up challenges

193
00:14:11,127 --> 00:14:17,709
that the player needs to complete, works along with the player and auto-corrects itself according

194
00:14:17,749 --> 00:14:22,390
to the player's play style or just doesn't really affect the gameplay in any way.

195
00:14:23,931 --> 00:14:33,395
And this choice has its base in our sanity mechanic, and the sanity mechanic has its base in that very early on in the project.

196
00:14:33,715 --> 00:14:36,496
We knew that we wanted the player to be afraid of the dark somehow.

197
00:14:36,536 --> 00:14:42,158
We knew that if he stayed in the dark he should be penetralized with something, so he should really fear the darkness.

198
00:14:42,819 --> 00:14:45,940
And we first thought, OK, let's lower the player's health.

199
00:14:47,321 --> 00:14:49,242
That doesn't really feel right.

200
00:14:49,342 --> 00:14:52,363
So we added a sanity system instead.

201
00:14:52,864 --> 00:14:56,145
We also extended this sanity system

202
00:14:56,285 --> 00:14:59,007
to monsters and other sites instead.

203
00:14:59,027 --> 00:15:02,609
And we added also for penalties to this.

204
00:15:02,989 --> 00:15:06,031
For example, if the player's walk speed,

205
00:15:06,151 --> 00:15:08,012
if it's insane, would be lower,

206
00:15:08,212 --> 00:15:12,174
or enemies would have easier to spot the player

207
00:15:12,234 --> 00:15:15,536
if he was insane, and then eventually the player would die.

208
00:15:16,156 --> 00:15:22,524
And so, with all these penalties in and we thought that, okay, the player will not want to be insane in our game,

209
00:15:22,784 --> 00:15:25,187
we just had to balance it.

210
00:15:25,387 --> 00:15:31,033
Now, this turns out, balancing this sort of system ain't very easy.

211
00:15:31,874 --> 00:15:37,442
Instead, there's lots of things to consider with this kind of balancing.

212
00:15:38,283 --> 00:15:39,684
How many tinderboxes?

213
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,690
These are the resources the players use to light up the environment.

214
00:15:43,730 --> 00:15:45,412
How many of those have the player collected?

215
00:15:45,672 --> 00:15:47,915
How fast do they move through our levels?

216
00:15:48,516 --> 00:15:48,616
And...

217
00:15:49,637 --> 00:15:53,319
how good is the spare on their lamp oil and so on.

218
00:15:53,679 --> 00:15:57,781
On top of this, the sanity system doesn't really reset itself,

219
00:15:57,922 --> 00:16:01,904
so something that you do, not pick up enough tinderboxes at the start of the game,

220
00:16:02,164 --> 00:16:04,425
can have repercussions at the end of the game.

221
00:16:04,625 --> 00:16:07,787
So, if we didn't find the system balanced,

222
00:16:07,867 --> 00:16:12,369
what we had to do was to replay the game several times,

223
00:16:12,609 --> 00:16:15,290
using different playstyles, every time we made a change.

224
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,211
It just wasn't workable.

225
00:16:17,592 --> 00:16:24,477
So it led to the design choice that was quite drastic, that okay, we shouldn't have any

226
00:16:24,537 --> 00:16:27,880
penalties, we shouldn't have any gaming aspects to the sanity system.

227
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:31,242
Instead, we thought it more as a mood feature.

228
00:16:31,763 --> 00:16:36,727
We just, the game system just keeps the balance.

229
00:16:38,888 --> 00:16:41,169
moves along in the same way that the player does.

230
00:16:41,229 --> 00:16:42,590
It auto-adapts itself.

231
00:16:43,210 --> 00:16:45,691
And once we had this kind of system in,

232
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:47,171
instead of auto-adapting itself,

233
00:16:47,271 --> 00:16:48,772
all of the problems disappeared.

234
00:16:49,152 --> 00:16:53,634
Plus, players were more immersed in this kind of system.

235
00:16:54,654 --> 00:16:56,375
Because they didn't have to beat it,

236
00:16:56,435 --> 00:16:59,076
so they can just role-play in it instead.

237
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:01,677
And this kind of auto-correction,

238
00:17:01,797 --> 00:17:05,179
it just also spurred the imagination of the players.

239
00:17:06,299 --> 00:17:09,742
roleplayed, what was happening to them and so on.

240
00:17:09,762 --> 00:17:14,766
And worth noting is that just as the no-death mechanic,

241
00:17:15,326 --> 00:17:18,328
even if the players figured out how the system worked,

242
00:17:18,649 --> 00:17:21,771
most players were scared anyway and were immersed in it,

243
00:17:21,911 --> 00:17:25,934
and some players were scared even more when they realized this.

244
00:17:26,595 --> 00:17:29,317
We applied this kind of thinking to our enemies instead.

245
00:17:29,377 --> 00:17:32,459
So we said, OK, instead of having them as a challenge,

246
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,881
all these enemies, let's have them as a part

247
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:37,122
of the atmosphere instead.

248
00:17:37,842 --> 00:17:39,683
And the way we went about with this

249
00:17:39,763 --> 00:17:43,306
is consider the players looking at an enemy.

250
00:17:43,826 --> 00:17:49,191
And he has to hide, and then he has to go in hiding in a corner in the oppressive darkness,

251
00:17:49,231 --> 00:17:54,036
his sanity is draining, and the enemy comes lurking and sniffing around,

252
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:57,039
trying to find the player, and the player sits there, he asks,

253
00:17:57,139 --> 00:18:00,562
oh will he go away? And then the enemy comes really close,

254
00:18:00,622 --> 00:18:04,606
and then he walks away just in time, and the player is just...

255
00:18:05,127 --> 00:18:07,988
finally he didn't spot me and then he can sneak up and

256
00:18:09,308 --> 00:18:15,971
is he still there and so on, having all these thoughts, but what really happened in the AI was that

257
00:18:16,411 --> 00:18:19,293
AI knew in a way where the player was and he was

258
00:18:19,653 --> 00:18:23,254
okay I'm gonna just get really close to the player and

259
00:18:23,574 --> 00:18:25,935
not near enough so he's really spooked

260
00:18:26,316 --> 00:18:30,637
and then I'm just gonna walk off and if he just sits still and doesn't run away and

261
00:18:30,677 --> 00:18:34,499
try to play a hero, which is changing the play style, he will be okay.

262
00:18:34,979 --> 00:18:40,322
And this sort of system, it creates these really tense moments that feel scripted,

263
00:18:40,562 --> 00:18:43,283
but they come out of the dynamics of the system.

264
00:18:43,523 --> 00:18:48,985
If we would have had a more competitive system that was supposed to challenge the player,

265
00:18:49,405 --> 00:18:53,287
having this sort of response would have been a lot harder,

266
00:18:53,307 --> 00:18:58,809
and it would have been a lot harder to have it consistently reproduced as well.

267
00:18:58,869 --> 00:19:03,531
I'm just going to list the different things I've gone through, so we have no weapons.

268
00:19:04,052 --> 00:19:06,974
and no death, and no competitive mechanics.

269
00:19:07,434 --> 00:19:13,378
With this stuff I'm just going to give a little taste what we accomplished by these things.

270
00:19:13,558 --> 00:19:19,122
And this footage I'm about to show might be a little bit disturbing, so sensitive viewers

271
00:19:19,202 --> 00:19:19,683
are warned.

272
00:19:33,182 --> 00:19:34,062
I know I'm not getting shot up.

273
00:19:35,284 --> 00:19:37,145
Oh, this is not like a bathroom with a gas filter.

274
00:19:38,006 --> 00:19:40,028
I'm going to need a hand.

275
00:19:40,269 --> 00:19:40,969
Oh shit!

276
00:19:42,751 --> 00:19:43,612
Oh fuck.

277
00:19:45,073 --> 00:19:47,015
Oh shit, I can see the thing!

278
00:19:47,496 --> 00:19:48,076
I can see it!

279
00:19:50,579 --> 00:19:50,959
Oh no.

280
00:19:51,239 --> 00:19:51,580
No!

281
00:19:52,220 --> 00:19:52,501
No!

282
00:19:53,041 --> 00:19:54,302
It's coming!

283
00:19:54,382 --> 00:19:54,823
It's gonna-

284
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:36,700
loneliness is probably the scariest thing I've seen so

285
00:20:36,801 --> 00:20:40,142
i'm not sure if this makes me a little bit

286
00:20:58,889 --> 00:21:03,895
So, I'm not sure if this makes me depraved, but I'm really pleased to see that kind of reaction.

287
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:09,103
So, this reaction, it's quite strong, but it's not a unique moment.

288
00:21:09,163 --> 00:21:13,829
If you search YouTube for amnesia reaction, you will see tons of this kind of stuff.

289
00:21:15,371 --> 00:21:19,615
I want to note again, these principles that we implemented, they were quite rushed.

290
00:21:19,635 --> 00:21:21,456
They were at the end of the project.

291
00:21:21,496 --> 00:21:26,760
The no-death mechanic and the no-competitive mechanics were at the very end of when we

292
00:21:26,800 --> 00:21:29,543
tried to fix everything else, it was rushed.

293
00:21:30,964 --> 00:21:35,527
So I believe there's tons more to explore with this kind of stuff.

294
00:21:35,607 --> 00:21:39,190
And this leads me to the next part of this talk.

295
00:21:40,151 --> 00:21:46,693
which I will go dig a little bit deeper into it and now it's time for three general principles.

296
00:21:47,813 --> 00:21:54,035
Now the no combat thing, what I think this boils down to is that we should be a little

297
00:21:54,055 --> 00:21:57,596
bit careful about finding fun fillers for our games.

298
00:21:58,036 --> 00:22:04,598
Fun fillers is something that I think is a gameplay mechanic that once implemented you

299
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:06,598
can have lots and lots of gameplay with it.

300
00:22:07,318 --> 00:22:10,419
And stuff like this is, of course, combat.

301
00:22:10,479 --> 00:22:12,739
It's used in pretty much every game.

302
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:16,900
And I think the reason for it, it's so hard to come up

303
00:22:16,940 --> 00:22:19,461
with other interesting ways of interacting

304
00:22:19,521 --> 00:22:22,421
with our virtual world, so we do it with combat.

305
00:22:22,441 --> 00:22:24,581
So instead of figuring out some system

306
00:22:24,641 --> 00:22:27,242
that can consistently be used in a way

307
00:22:27,322 --> 00:22:29,542
to move along with the narrative,

308
00:22:29,582 --> 00:22:32,943
you just want to drop a bunch of enemies into a room

309
00:22:32,983 --> 00:22:35,263
and then place the player there and have them fight them.

310
00:22:36,244 --> 00:22:42,008
This is why the lure of the combat is so strong and we have been tempted ourselves as well.

311
00:22:42,548 --> 00:22:47,392
But as we have seen, once we remove the combat, new horizons open up.

312
00:22:47,552 --> 00:22:54,658
Once we remove that weapon that bobs in front of the screen, players start to approach the

313
00:22:54,678 --> 00:22:55,819
game quite differently.

314
00:22:55,939 --> 00:22:58,921
And I think there are three major reasons for this.

315
00:22:59,522 --> 00:23:02,964
The first off is the myth of multitasking.

316
00:23:03,004 --> 00:23:11,809
We like to believe our brains are these big parallel computers that can take in input from all over the place and process it all simultaneously.

317
00:23:11,889 --> 00:23:18,252
So at the lower circuitry level our brains are big parallel computers, but at the higher level it just doesn't work that way.

318
00:23:18,272 --> 00:23:22,154
Instead they are like in techy speak, like single core computers.

319
00:23:23,895 --> 00:23:26,336
two things that you want to do at the same time.

320
00:23:26,816 --> 00:23:28,516
You have to switch between them.

321
00:23:28,877 --> 00:23:30,937
And every switch means an overhead.

322
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:37,259
And this overhead means that you lose some sort of time when you're doing something.

323
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:41,560
So this is the reason why you don't want to talk on a cell phone while driving.

324
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:47,421
Or if you're watching cat clips on YouTube while I'm giving this lecture, you might not

325
00:23:47,481 --> 00:23:49,721
get every word that I'm saying.

326
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:56,066
Okay, everyone get that? So, let's move on here.

327
00:23:58,327 --> 00:24:04,911
Now, this of course has impact on our games. If we have a game that's about combat,

328
00:24:04,931 --> 00:24:07,232
then you have other elements in the game as well.

329
00:24:07,772 --> 00:24:13,315
If the player chooses to focus on these other elements, they will be worse at the combat.

330
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:19,257
So, if the combat has a competitive element to it, meaning that if you're good at it,

331
00:24:19,337 --> 00:24:22,337
it's easier to progress and you get more out of the game.

332
00:24:22,778 --> 00:24:27,739
If you have an audio log popping up from somewhere while the player is shooting off enemies,

333
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:32,300
they will just push that audio log aside and keep shooting at the enemies because that's

334
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:33,620
what the game is about.

335
00:24:34,100 --> 00:24:38,941
And there doesn't even have to be enemies on screen while you're...

336
00:24:39,902 --> 00:24:47,923
because this effect is set in, they can just have the threat of having enemies and the focus will be off from other things instead.

337
00:24:49,004 --> 00:24:56,445
But if you remove this, clear your head and the player is free to focus on other things instead.

338
00:24:56,505 --> 00:25:02,067
And when we made this switch from Penumbra Overture to Black Plague, where Black Plague didn't have combat,

339
00:25:02,407 --> 00:25:04,447
it was quite obvious this change.

340
00:25:05,027 --> 00:25:11,889
Now, the second reason for not having combat is that the tools we give to the player, they

341
00:25:11,989 --> 00:25:14,870
tell them what role they have in our games.

342
00:25:15,391 --> 00:25:20,232
So if you give the player a gun, he will expect to go to a shooting range.

343
00:25:20,612 --> 00:25:25,757
Now, this is partly because of condition. We've learned to play games in this way in the past.

344
00:25:26,077 --> 00:25:31,001
But it's also that once you have a specific tool for the player, an interaction,

345
00:25:31,381 --> 00:25:34,003
it will tell the player what role they play.

346
00:25:34,244 --> 00:25:36,585
The way they interact with the world...

347
00:25:37,426 --> 00:25:41,611
the changes or defines the way the player is.

348
00:25:41,811 --> 00:25:45,555
So, if we want to, for example, have the player

349
00:25:45,575 --> 00:25:47,857
that's a detective, we need to make sure

350
00:25:47,917 --> 00:25:50,160
that the interactions we have in our game

351
00:25:50,500 --> 00:25:52,802
supports this role of the player.

352
00:25:53,463 --> 00:25:55,946
So, if we want to have different.

353
00:25:56,426 --> 00:26:02,469
expressive in games, we need to make sure that the interaction supports these expressions.

354
00:26:02,529 --> 00:26:07,991
The larger part an interaction has in a game, the larger part it will form the way the players

355
00:26:08,051 --> 00:26:08,891
see themselves.

356
00:26:10,969 --> 00:26:16,514
And I think it was Tim Schafer that said that he realised how psychopaths must feel.

357
00:26:16,534 --> 00:26:22,919
The only way they can express themselves is with a gun, so all people they meet they just shoot at.

358
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:27,664
And if we want to have different experiences, we need to have different sorts of interaction.

359
00:26:28,304 --> 00:26:33,349
Once we remove weapons, we force the player into expressing themselves in different ways.

360
00:26:34,870 --> 00:26:39,314
The third reason is density of information flow.

361
00:26:39,654 --> 00:26:46,540
I like to liken amnesia to a sort of sensory deprivation chamber.

362
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:52,605
Once the player is in the game, they start to focus all on this small stuff

363
00:26:52,665 --> 00:26:56,188
that they, in a combat game, wouldn't notice at all.

364
00:26:57,369 --> 00:27:01,471
For example, if a small sound or a quiet sound is playing,

365
00:27:01,511 --> 00:27:04,532
they will give lots of thought to this sound.

366
00:27:04,552 --> 00:27:06,413
So if they hear some creaking in the corridor,

367
00:27:06,473 --> 00:27:08,494
they will start thinking, what was that noise?

368
00:27:09,574 --> 00:27:12,115
Could it have been a creature stalking me?

369
00:27:12,755 --> 00:27:13,476
Oh, I'm hunted.

370
00:27:13,676 --> 00:27:14,376
I need to hide.

371
00:27:14,436 --> 00:27:16,617
And this is just from a little sound.

372
00:27:16,677 --> 00:27:19,918
And when watching videos of people playing our game,

373
00:27:20,879 --> 00:27:23,660
we see this vast difference from other games

374
00:27:23,740 --> 00:27:26,101
that have much more action focus.

375
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:34,195
Now, the downside of having this sort of approach is that it's much harder to design it.

376
00:27:34,575 --> 00:27:39,637
As a designer, you know every nook and cranny of the levels that you're designing.

377
00:27:39,977 --> 00:27:43,798
So when you're trying to put yourself in the place of a first-time player...

378
00:27:44,779 --> 00:27:49,981
you won't, it will be very hard to emulate the kind of experience they're going to have.

379
00:27:50,001 --> 00:27:53,403
An example of this is this map in Amnesia.

380
00:27:53,983 --> 00:27:57,745
We were sure that it would be really boring when we talked about it and said,

381
00:27:58,045 --> 00:28:01,826
oh, there's not enough events, it's not going to be very frightening,

382
00:28:01,846 --> 00:28:04,868
the player's going to be bored out of their skulls when playing this.

383
00:28:05,428 --> 00:28:09,290
Then it turns out, when they played it, they were more than enough engaged,

384
00:28:09,310 --> 00:28:14,012
they thought that it was really thrilling, this level, and we had no idea about this.

385
00:28:14,573 --> 00:28:19,999
So, because of this hardness, I think it might not be tempting to have this sort of design

386
00:28:20,019 --> 00:28:21,902
because it's very hard to try it out.

387
00:28:21,982 --> 00:28:27,328
But I mean, this is a new thing and the more we can design levels in this way, the more

388
00:28:27,368 --> 00:28:27,969
we learn it.

389
00:28:28,049 --> 00:28:31,693
And I think it can become much more intuitive than it was for us.

390
00:28:33,976 --> 00:28:45,785
A really great example of this loss of information, or of smaller information density, comes from the blog which is called Awesome X Machinima.

391
00:28:46,346 --> 00:28:51,149
And the writer there, he tries to play GTA IV as a law-abiding citizen.

392
00:28:51,209 --> 00:28:53,411
And here's what he writes about it, some snippets.

393
00:28:54,105 --> 00:28:59,630
Walking the streets, I heard near hours of conversations, insults and quips from the

394
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:04,314
civilians walking the streets that I had never heard, things I certainly would have missed

395
00:29:04,414 --> 00:29:08,477
careering down the streets at top speed and shooting back at the cops in pursuit of me.

396
00:29:09,158 --> 00:29:13,382
I saw billboards I never knew existed, buildings I had no idea I could enter.

397
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:18,246
I watched a man on a bench flip through a fully rendered pages of an actual book, a

398
00:29:18,306 --> 00:29:22,670
store owner meticulously clean a sidewalk, and watched a police officer place someone

399
00:29:22,710 --> 00:29:25,593
in the back of his cruiser after an elaborate fruit pursuit.

400
00:29:26,413 --> 00:29:27,534
Later down he writes this.

401
00:29:28,115 --> 00:29:32,961
Rather than the poor for the course, every infraction, no matter how slight,

402
00:29:33,321 --> 00:29:35,383
becomes a thrilling crescendo moment.

403
00:29:35,704 --> 00:29:39,048
This made the missions themselves a nerve-wracking experience.

404
00:29:39,408 --> 00:29:44,454
And I just think this greatly shows the new kind of frontiers this opens up

405
00:29:44,534 --> 00:29:45,976
with this sort of thinking.

406
00:29:46,937 --> 00:29:50,558
Now, the next lesson is no proper death.

407
00:29:51,078 --> 00:30:00,202
The lesson I think here from this design principle is that we should really carefully consider if trial and error is something that we want in our games.

408
00:30:00,302 --> 00:30:04,103
Now, obviously some games thrive on trial and error.

409
00:30:04,123 --> 00:30:06,184
I'm not saying that these games should throw them out.

410
00:30:06,284 --> 00:30:07,644
But if you have a game...

411
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:12,308
where the player is supposed to be present in our virtual worlds,

412
00:30:12,609 --> 00:30:13,689
we need to consider,

413
00:30:13,990 --> 00:30:19,374
do we really want the player to be stuck in an endless loop

414
00:30:19,434 --> 00:30:22,917
or be forced to repeat things over and over again?

415
00:30:22,957 --> 00:30:27,441
And there are three main reasons why we do not want to do it,

416
00:30:27,521 --> 00:30:28,462
at least I think there is.

417
00:30:29,063 --> 00:30:32,025
First of all, hard to repeat moments.

418
00:30:32,045 --> 00:30:34,047
And I think this is the most important one.

419
00:30:35,048 --> 00:30:38,450
An obvious example, as I've mentioned before, are the chase sequences.

420
00:30:38,510 --> 00:30:42,092
When you repeat them too many times, they just weren't tense anymore.

421
00:30:42,352 --> 00:30:43,893
But there are other examples as well.

422
00:30:44,474 --> 00:30:50,878
Sad scenes, scenes that are boring but set the mood, or scenes that are just sensory

423
00:30:50,938 --> 00:30:51,618
demanding.

424
00:30:51,998 --> 00:30:54,580
Other media, they thrive on these sort of things.

425
00:30:55,160 --> 00:31:00,528
But they're almost absent from actual gameplay, not cutscenes that is in our games.

426
00:31:00,628 --> 00:31:07,117
And I think that we might actually or probably missing out on a lot of things if the only

427
00:31:07,177 --> 00:31:11,944
thing that we want in our games are situations that are easily repeated.

428
00:31:12,785 --> 00:31:18,889
The next reason is that once you repeat something over and over, you start to see below this,

429
00:31:18,929 --> 00:31:21,211
you start to see the mechanics, how it all works.

430
00:31:21,591 --> 00:31:27,535
And having trial and error not only makes this possible, it might even force this behaviour.

431
00:31:27,615 --> 00:31:30,057
If you have something that the player needs to overcome,

432
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:35,280
and the player, in order to progress, he needs to figure this out, he needs to overcome it.

433
00:31:36,601 --> 00:31:41,503
the player is forced into thinking how does this system really works and the way they do it is that

434
00:31:41,543 --> 00:31:46,004
they ship away on their own make-belief and they're taking themselves out of the immersion

435
00:31:46,244 --> 00:31:52,366
the more times to repeat it and I'm not sure if that's something that we want in our game

436
00:31:53,267 --> 00:31:56,428
making the players feel unimmersed by the game mechanics.

437
00:31:57,968 --> 00:32:04,274
Now, the last and perhaps more evident reason is just the flow of the player's narrative.

438
00:32:04,755 --> 00:32:13,082
Do we really want players to repeat sections? Is that a good part of the narrative we want to bring to the player?

439
00:32:14,623 --> 00:32:19,988
I think this is a very important part, but some people might say, okay, but if we just

440
00:32:20,068 --> 00:32:26,233
let the player play through all this without no obstacles, there will be no tension.

441
00:32:26,573 --> 00:32:32,057
But if a horror game as Amnesia cannot have any trial and error and still manages to be

442
00:32:32,077 --> 00:32:37,662
scary, perhaps even more scary, I'm not seeing why this shouldn't be possible for other games

443
00:32:37,762 --> 00:32:40,524
as well that aren't horror games.

444
00:32:41,145 --> 00:32:47,671
Now, last design principle. This is the no competitive mechanic that we used for the sanity in AI.

445
00:32:48,111 --> 00:32:52,595
And what we learned from this is once we removed the competitive aspect,

446
00:32:53,116 --> 00:32:57,580
forced the player into overcoming these goals and trying to beat the system,

447
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:02,204
we got a better response and it was much easier to consistently...

448
00:33:03,405 --> 00:33:05,549
replicate the behaviors that we wanted.

449
00:33:06,730 --> 00:33:12,380
What it did was that it allowed role-playing instead of the player optimizing a system.

450
00:33:12,420 --> 00:33:15,224
Now, what I mean by optimizing a system is that

451
00:33:17,047 --> 00:33:24,276
Normally what the player does with this interaction once it's competitive is that it changes the game's stats in some way.

452
00:33:24,296 --> 00:33:28,020
So for example, you say the player is faced with two enemies.

453
00:33:28,381 --> 00:33:35,870
Now he has to make a choice here, what to do, and it depends on, okay, what weapons do I have at hand, and how much ammo do I have for each weapon.

454
00:33:36,450 --> 00:33:40,933
What are these enemies? What kind of stats do I know they have? What weaknesses do they have?

455
00:33:41,293 --> 00:33:46,015
And what might I meet at the road ahead? And so on and so forth.

456
00:33:46,075 --> 00:33:49,037
Now, the player can choose, okay, I'm just going to do what's fun.

457
00:33:49,157 --> 00:33:52,298
But that's not mostly what happens.

458
00:33:52,358 --> 00:33:59,082
What happens is that the player tries to do what is best for them game stats or game mechanically-wise.

459
00:33:59,122 --> 00:34:04,224
And they try to have bad things happening to themselves. They try to avoid that.

460
00:34:04,945 --> 00:34:12,451
And what this does is that it forces the players into a certain behavior controlled by the game mechanics.

461
00:34:13,592 --> 00:34:18,736
Now, imagine having this sort of optimizing system, or optimizing experience,

462
00:34:18,836 --> 00:34:22,759
for something that is supposed to elicit emotions from the player,

463
00:34:22,819 --> 00:34:24,641
like simulating a relationship.

464
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:27,984
Say we have a character that constantly follows the player around.

465
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:31,766
we might come to a situation where the player stands between,

466
00:34:31,826 --> 00:34:35,930
okay, either I'm going to do what my feelings tell me to do,

467
00:34:35,950 --> 00:34:39,292
or I'm going to do what's best for me gameplay-wise.

468
00:34:39,832 --> 00:34:42,935
Now, this might, of course, be interesting,

469
00:34:43,055 --> 00:34:46,057
but what I think mostly happens is that the player will just,

470
00:34:46,117 --> 00:34:48,519
okay, I'm just going to do what's best for me gameplay-wise,

471
00:34:48,559 --> 00:34:51,821
let's screw the feelings here, I want to progress later in the game.

472
00:34:52,102 --> 00:34:55,484
And if you have a system that have repercussions over a long time,

473
00:34:55,885 --> 00:34:57,446
like we know our relationship has,

474
00:34:57,806 --> 00:34:58,547
then, I mean the...

475
00:34:58,647 --> 00:35:03,831
player is not going to want to jeopardize their gameplay later on in the game.

476
00:35:03,851 --> 00:35:08,035
They're not sure what's going to happen for them later on.

477
00:35:08,696 --> 00:35:14,561
And this is why I think that if we want to do something like this, we need to remove

478
00:35:14,581 --> 00:35:15,642
the competitive aspect.

479
00:35:15,662 --> 00:35:21,707
We need to see this sort of mechanics as something that just brings more to the experience.

480
00:35:22,688 --> 00:35:27,310
And also, another thing with having, if you think that, okay, okay, I'm going to have

481
00:35:27,370 --> 00:35:31,192
game mechanics, but I'm sure that my game mechanics are going to go hand in hand to

482
00:35:31,212 --> 00:35:31,772
the feelings.

483
00:35:31,832 --> 00:35:37,234
But as we saw with the sanity mechanics over a long game, it's try balancing that, try

484
00:35:37,294 --> 00:35:42,096
playing your five-hour game for over and over using different play styles and making sure

485
00:35:42,156 --> 00:35:45,958
that they have the consistent emotion throughout.

486
00:35:46,078 --> 00:35:48,479
It's very hard, if not impossible task.

487
00:35:49,629 --> 00:35:56,999
Now, instead I think, as I said, that we should see this as something that is just part that improves the experience.

488
00:35:57,019 --> 00:35:58,280
Think about game graphics.

489
00:35:58,701 --> 00:36:04,949
Game graphics started out as something that could hardly represent what the core of the game was,

490
00:36:05,009 --> 00:36:07,932
and then as we have progressed, we're getting better and better and better.

491
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:14,175
sort of game graphics, where at this moment we have all these graphics and pretty much none of it

492
00:36:14,355 --> 00:36:18,097
directly has anything to do with the core of the game.

493
00:36:18,397 --> 00:36:23,680
And I think that game mechanics can play the same part, that they don't have to be part of the core game,

494
00:36:23,940 --> 00:36:27,521
but they can just enhance the experience in some way for us.

495
00:36:29,235 --> 00:36:36,858
Now, to round up this talk and just discuss quickly the road ahead a little bit, I want

496
00:36:36,878 --> 00:36:39,759
to just dig into what these principles mean.

497
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:43,441
First of all, I said we just scratched the surface on the things I've talked about.

498
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:48,603
There's tons of stuff that we can improve that we already know we can improve and I'm

499
00:36:48,663 --> 00:36:50,664
sure other people can figure out even more.

500
00:36:50,744 --> 00:36:56,227
But there's a central theme to these sort of principles and I think that's even more

501
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:56,827
important.

502
00:36:57,367 --> 00:37:01,210
We have the no deaths thingy, and we removed the fail state from it.

503
00:37:01,230 --> 00:37:03,832
We shipped away on something that's common in games.

504
00:37:04,152 --> 00:37:07,155
And what we found underneath, what was brought to us underneath,

505
00:37:07,195 --> 00:37:09,536
was a totally different kind of experience.

506
00:37:09,877 --> 00:37:13,720
We removed combat from the game. Combat, that's so common in games.

507
00:37:13,740 --> 00:37:17,863
We shipped away on that, and then when we homed in on what we wanted with our game,

508
00:37:18,243 --> 00:37:19,945
found these other things instead.

509
00:37:19,965 --> 00:37:23,048
We finally removed competitive mechanics.

510
00:37:23,108 --> 00:37:27,993
We let the mechanics move along and auto-correct themselves with the player

511
00:37:28,033 --> 00:37:31,177
instead of constantly setting up goals.

512
00:37:31,237 --> 00:37:32,398
And we shipped away on that.

513
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:38,665
Another time we just figured something there below that was so much more interesting.

514
00:37:40,186 --> 00:37:45,931
There's a pattern here by focusing on what you believe is the central experience.

515
00:37:46,232 --> 00:37:50,375
You can think of changes that can be made to the game or changes happens to the game

516
00:37:50,575 --> 00:37:51,876
that you never thought would.

517
00:37:52,477 --> 00:37:57,441
All of this came about when we asked ourselves, what is our game really about?

518
00:37:57,822 --> 00:38:00,744
What is the real intent of our game?

519
00:38:00,864 --> 00:38:02,385
I think that's the big lesson here.

520
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:07,469
Without this sort of thinking, amnesia would not have been possible to make.

521
00:38:07,789 --> 00:38:10,771
And I don't think this is true only because it's a horror game.

522
00:38:11,052 --> 00:38:15,715
That the market, and it's true that the market for horror games is more used to throwing

523
00:38:15,735 --> 00:38:17,976
away common game design principles.

524
00:38:18,437 --> 00:38:23,700
What that tells me is that other kinds of games have even more to explore because the

525
00:38:23,941 --> 00:38:26,242
horror game genre have already explored all this.

526
00:38:27,423 --> 00:38:31,945
If we want to advance our medium, we must allow it to be expressive.

527
00:38:32,225 --> 00:38:35,126
We must not think about how games are supposed to be,

528
00:38:35,446 --> 00:38:39,027
but we must think about what kind of meaning we want them to carry.

529
00:38:39,487 --> 00:38:42,809
And that's where I believe that the future of games lies.

530
00:38:43,249 --> 00:38:43,849
Thanks for listening!

531
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:10,020
Any questions or anything?

532
00:39:11,341 --> 00:39:14,422
Ask me anything, not anything, that was a bad wording for me.

533
00:39:18,223 --> 00:39:20,724
Yeah, is there a microphone there, is it on?

534
00:39:21,944 --> 00:39:24,205
So we get it on the recording.

535
00:39:26,826 --> 00:39:29,867
My name is Gunnar Ville from Danish Game Education.

536
00:39:31,136 --> 00:39:38,007
And I think you're right in that this thing can be used for other games than horror games.

537
00:39:38,809 --> 00:39:42,495
Could you come with an example of what could be done to other games?

538
00:39:44,338 --> 00:40:02,348
For example, ok now I'm just going to take this out of the top of my head, but for example a romance game, picture you have a, if you just take the general consensus of how you design a game, you should have made a romance game with points, like hearts, ok how many hearts have I collected and then make it into a challenge or something.

539
00:40:02,649 --> 00:40:09,052
But instead you might just think about just let the player move along with this kind of stuff and depending on, he might not.

540
00:40:09,693 --> 00:40:14,777
fail but he might get a different experience what he tries out. Don't punish him for making

541
00:40:14,817 --> 00:40:19,721
a wrong move or something like that. And that you might get to the right kind of experience.

542
00:40:19,761 --> 00:40:25,125
Don't let the player roleplay instead. That's just off the top of my head but there's tons

543
00:40:25,185 --> 00:40:32,230
of other stuff. I mean games that take place during an expedition to the Arctic or whatnot.

544
00:40:34,252 --> 00:40:35,373
Come on, that would be fun!

545
00:40:35,653 --> 00:40:39,577
Like the John Franklin expedition as a game, I would play that.

546
00:40:41,900 --> 00:40:42,460
Anything else?

547
00:40:42,781 --> 00:40:43,461
No one else?

548
00:40:44,322 --> 00:40:44,462
Hi.

549
00:40:45,363 --> 00:40:46,424
First of all, thank you.

550
00:40:46,604 --> 00:40:48,246
Wow, that was a real brain teaser.

551
00:40:50,699 --> 00:40:57,643
When you talk about pain mechanics without trial and error and competitive mechanics features,

552
00:40:58,784 --> 00:41:02,686
and when you talk about not maximizing the game stats of the players,

553
00:41:03,226 --> 00:41:06,328
wouldn't that ultimately lead to movies?

554
00:41:07,309 --> 00:41:10,751
And where do you get the game back into the experience?

555
00:41:11,702 --> 00:41:16,207
Well, it's all part of... is the interaction part of the experience?

556
00:41:16,267 --> 00:41:17,809
I mean, what is a movie? It's a...

557
00:41:18,810 --> 00:41:22,134
It's a pre-made stream of consciousness that you get.

558
00:41:22,174 --> 00:41:23,655
You can't change the movie.

559
00:41:23,976 --> 00:41:27,980
But if you have this interaction and the player can move along in the world...

560
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:28,200
I mean...

561
00:41:29,041 --> 00:41:32,504
Just an example here, I'm not saying that amnesia is like the best example.

562
00:41:32,524 --> 00:41:36,468
Amnesia is just move along with the player, there's no competition.

563
00:41:36,668 --> 00:41:39,170
But the competition can come from other things as well.

564
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:41,372
You can have, what should I do in this?

565
00:41:41,412 --> 00:41:43,594
You can still have repercussions to it.

566
00:41:43,934 --> 00:41:44,675
For example...

567
00:41:45,936 --> 00:41:50,681
Let's just say that the player chooses not to save a character due to whatever reason,

568
00:41:50,701 --> 00:41:53,664
then stuff can happen in the game due to them not saving,

569
00:41:53,704 --> 00:41:58,749
but it doesn't mean that it game mechanically has to be, it can just be emotional things.

570
00:41:59,069 --> 00:42:04,294
I mean, you don't care about a character dying in whatever movie you see, because...

571
00:42:05,475 --> 00:42:07,896
because it affects your DVD players.

572
00:42:07,997 --> 00:42:12,379
Okay, now you can watch DVDs for another 15 minutes next week because you died.

573
00:42:12,419 --> 00:42:16,120
I mean, that's not the thing where you're emotionally invested in something.

574
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,522
And that emotional investment can be just as strong as a game mechanic can.

575
00:42:20,863 --> 00:42:26,185
And it doesn't really run wild at the same pace because the player can themselves

576
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:33,188
change how they want this game mechanic to be, or roleplay how they want to perceive it.

577
00:42:34,582 --> 00:42:37,304
If that makes sense. Did I answer it?

578
00:42:39,666 --> 00:42:40,327
Any other questions?

579
00:42:42,689 --> 00:42:43,009
Thank you.

580
00:42:43,850 --> 00:42:44,130
Thank you.
