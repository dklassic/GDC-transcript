00:00:06,282 --> 00:00:08,103
Thank you, Scott. Thank you very much, everyone.

2
00:00:09,183 --> 00:00:11,325
Somebody was worried that this was a little bit too small

3
00:00:11,425 --> 00:00:13,926
and the text might be hard for you to read because we're not doing the whole screen.

4
00:00:14,207 --> 00:00:16,888
This is the only text in the whole presentation, so you don't have to worry about it.

5
00:00:18,389 --> 00:00:21,511
The idea about this is that I wanted to take a common object.

6
00:00:21,911 --> 00:00:25,934
We either all own a car, at the very least, I suspect we've all been in a car at some stage,

7
00:00:26,414 --> 00:00:28,656
or, at the very, very least, we've all seen a car.

8
00:00:29,176 --> 00:00:31,677
Literally, we have to dodge them to get into this building.

9
00:00:32,558 --> 00:00:35,701
By using a common object, it just means it's...

10
00:00:36,081 --> 00:00:38,263
I can communicate some concepts to you

11
00:00:38,383 --> 00:00:39,645
in a really, really simple manner.

12
00:00:40,165 --> 00:00:40,866
And also, it's actually...

13
00:00:40,886 --> 00:00:43,648
I mean, cars are fairly common objects in games as well,

14
00:00:43,668 --> 00:00:44,950
so it's relevant in that regard.

15
00:00:47,371 --> 00:00:51,175
I've been working in VR and AR for quite some time, and I even wrote a book on the subject.

16
00:00:51,955 --> 00:00:56,079
And what I've discovered is that this field is changing so quickly

17
00:00:56,419 --> 00:00:57,580
that it's really hard to keep up.

18
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,364
Like, within a few weeks of the book basically being signed off and published and everything like that,

19
00:01:01,404 --> 00:01:03,866
I'm like, I want to change that and I want to update that.

20
00:01:04,126 --> 00:01:07,549
So this in some ways is a little bit of an update of some of the thoughts that I've had.

21
00:01:08,290 --> 00:01:12,452
Where I was originally was that VR is all about immersion,

22
00:01:12,752 --> 00:01:16,854
because we are placing somebody into an environment.

23
00:01:17,254 --> 00:01:21,496
If I put up the best PlayStation or Xbox game on this screen right now,

24
00:01:21,556 --> 00:01:22,976
and we're playing it with our controllers,

25
00:01:23,517 --> 00:01:27,839
essentially what we're doing is it feels like we're stuck looking through a window.

26
00:01:28,907 --> 00:01:33,930
And the game is all the kids outside having fun, but we're stuck inside and we can't go out to play.

27
00:01:34,370 --> 00:01:39,374
Whereas VR allows us to actually go, awesome, we are inside everything.

28
00:01:39,714 --> 00:01:41,475
So that's where the importance of immersion is.

29
00:01:41,915 --> 00:01:48,039
And one of the quick things I will point out is that what I've found is there's quite a few people working on VR who are kind of not getting that.

30
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:51,902
I'm finding a lot of VR experiences where they've got headlocked stereo sound.

31
00:01:52,780 --> 00:01:56,180
Now, if I'm standing in a rainstorm, there is rain all around me.

32
00:01:56,500 --> 00:01:59,421
So we'll call it raindrop A here, raindrop B here,

33
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:01,662
but we've also got raindrops C and D.

34
00:02:02,122 --> 00:02:03,982
My relationship to those raindrops

35
00:02:05,062 --> 00:02:07,283
changes dramatically when I turn my head.

36
00:02:07,303 --> 00:02:09,343
You've got stereo rain,

37
00:02:10,543 --> 00:02:15,024
bam, you have immediately undermined your entire concept

38
00:02:15,064 --> 00:02:16,885
of providing me with a virtual environment.

39
00:02:17,385 --> 00:02:19,945
So that's one of the aspects, but one of the other ones...

40
00:02:21,038 --> 00:02:24,019
is scale, and that's what we're going to be talking about today.

41
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,902
So, this is a representation of my car.

42
00:02:30,382 --> 00:02:32,643
My actual car is white, not green,

43
00:02:32,663 --> 00:02:33,884
and has slightly different wheels.

44
00:02:33,904 --> 00:02:35,644
It might have a little engine in it.

45
00:02:36,305 --> 00:02:37,685
But the concept is the same.

46
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,407
I'm using a very, very standard hatchback car,

47
00:02:41,707 --> 00:02:43,048
nothing surprising about it,

48
00:02:43,108 --> 00:02:44,728
nothing particularly unusual about it.

49
00:02:45,369 --> 00:02:46,989
And what we're going to do is, we're going to...

50
00:02:48,260 --> 00:02:54,224
Expose it a piece at a time so that I can explain to you kind of why a car is important,

51
00:02:54,284 --> 00:02:55,984
especially when we're talking VR and AR.

52
00:02:57,685 --> 00:03:02,708
And I can do this by walking down here because this screen is a little bit small, so it's

53
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:07,451
not quite life-size, but we can see here that a car is a large object in relation to me.

54
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:13,121
If a car was in a video game, it's an object on a screen that's about that big, and you

55
00:03:13,161 --> 00:03:17,723
can quite often get away with having a single sound attached to that car, and the car moves

56
00:03:17,763 --> 00:03:19,243
around and it makes noise.

57
00:03:19,703 --> 00:03:24,565
But as soon as we scale this thing up, there are immediately two points about this.

58
00:03:24,785 --> 00:03:31,428
If I'm over here, the prominent sound I'm going to hear is the engine, which the car

59
00:03:31,488 --> 00:03:32,928
on the car's idling, let's assume that.

60
00:03:33,649 --> 00:03:34,509
So I'm hearing the engine.

61
00:03:34,629 --> 00:03:35,509
But in VR. .

62
00:03:36,517 --> 00:03:39,217
Because of the scale and quite often because of the freedom, I can go,

63
00:03:39,237 --> 00:03:42,578
yeah, okay, engine, that's fine. I'm going to come down here.

64
00:03:44,019 --> 00:03:47,860
And not just come down to the back end of the car, but I'm actually going to get

65
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,301
down on my hands and knees, and I'm going to put my head right down

66
00:03:51,341 --> 00:03:53,922
with the exhaust pipe, knowing that they get really, really hot.

67
00:03:53,942 --> 00:03:57,223
I'm going to be really, really careful. Yes, I have melted microphone covers,

68
00:03:57,283 --> 00:04:00,144
getting them too close to exhaust pipes. But this is the point.

69
00:04:00,364 --> 00:04:04,325
This car already is now, at the very least, two sound emitters.

70
00:04:06,005 --> 00:04:10,368
Because I can get close up to this exhaust pipe, and the thing about the exhaust pipe

71
00:04:10,408 --> 00:04:12,709
is not just that it should be one extra sound.

72
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:17,812
If I'm standing here, and the exhaust pipe's down there, I'm going to get one type of sound.

73
00:04:18,493 --> 00:04:22,095
As I lean down onto my hands and knees and put my ears right near it, it's not just that

74
00:04:22,155 --> 00:04:23,896
that sound gets louder.

75
00:04:25,117 --> 00:04:27,259
What I'm hearing actually changes.

76
00:04:28,252 --> 00:04:29,954
It's the difference between a waterfall.

77
00:04:29,994 --> 00:04:34,618
If you're at a waterfall and it's 500 meters away, it's just a very, very generic white

78
00:04:34,718 --> 00:04:35,038
noise.

79
00:04:35,078 --> 00:04:39,542
But as you get closer to it and closer to it, the resolution, in the same way that the

80
00:04:39,643 --> 00:04:45,768
visual resolution of the waterfall changes, the sonic resolution changes as well.

81
00:04:45,808 --> 00:04:47,350
There's more detail.

82
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:51,593
You can see, you can get up to the point where you can practically see the pixels of the

83
00:04:51,673 --> 00:04:51,934
audio.

84
00:04:52,434 --> 00:04:57,159
So as I get my ear down near the exhaust pipe, I'm hearing the popping and cracking and I

85
00:04:57,199 --> 00:04:59,481
can hear what's going on inside the engine.

86
00:04:59,662 --> 00:05:03,105
Whereas if I'm this far away from it, it's just a general low hum.

87
00:05:04,867 --> 00:05:09,111
So already what we've got here is, our car has now been split in two.

88
00:05:11,692 --> 00:05:15,435
Focusing on the exhaust pipe, getting close to the exhaust pipe,

89
00:05:15,775 --> 00:05:19,178
what we need to do is we need to understand that there is a difference in resolution.

90
00:05:20,099 --> 00:05:24,983
And as I say, that resolution is not just it's louder or maybe a filter or whatever.

91
00:05:25,463 --> 00:05:31,208
I would suggest and recommend in a lot of cases you need to have, like an LOD,

92
00:05:31,248 --> 00:05:35,472
sort of like two or three different sounds that you're cross-fading between depending on where I am.

93
00:05:38,584 --> 00:05:39,844
Now the engine is the next thing.

94
00:05:40,404 --> 00:05:42,905
If we sort of pull the engine out a little bit,

95
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:49,046
a standard car engine is a fairly large,

96
00:05:49,226 --> 00:05:51,466
depending on what size car engine it is,

97
00:05:51,486 --> 00:05:53,847
is a fairly large object.

98
00:05:56,607 --> 00:06:00,148
But it's not, again, an engine is not a single sound source.

99
00:06:01,288 --> 00:06:02,768
Any of you who own a car,

100
00:06:03,449 --> 00:06:04,749
I really, really recommend you do this.

101
00:06:07,214 --> 00:06:10,616
Find your car, switch it on, let it idle, open the bonnet up,

102
00:06:11,917 --> 00:06:13,078
and just lean around.

103
00:06:13,518 --> 00:06:15,480
Move your head around, carefully obviously.

104
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,942
Move your head around, you know, to the side,

105
00:06:19,022 --> 00:06:20,984
move around to the front, lean over there,

106
00:06:21,184 --> 00:06:23,226
you've got a fan belt going here, you've got pistons going here.

107
00:06:24,086 --> 00:06:25,808
The average car engine is made up,

108
00:06:25,888 --> 00:06:31,372
it is a complex sound made up of dozens of aspects.

109
00:06:32,252 --> 00:06:32,953
So again...

110
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:37,233
Car game, you know, the car's this big on the television screen, then fine.

111
00:06:37,573 --> 00:06:41,476
But if this is a VR game where I can walk over and I can throw open the bonnet

112
00:06:41,536 --> 00:06:43,338
and part of the game is to find out what's wrong with the car.

113
00:06:43,378 --> 00:06:45,639
It's like, oh, is it a fan belt? No, that sounds okay.

114
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:47,841
Oh, this thing's rattling over here, it might be that.

115
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,743
And what have we got over here? We've got this thing buzzing.

116
00:06:50,764 --> 00:06:59,431
So the level of detail is directly relative to the scale that we allow ourselves to deal with.

117
00:06:59,891 --> 00:07:02,473
And in VR, sometimes the scale can be huge.

118
00:07:03,904 --> 00:07:09,947
So, we look at the individual engine, and I will tell you, you know, there's pistons going up and down,

119
00:07:10,187 --> 00:07:15,709
but, you know, the sound of the pistons going up and down is going to be very different if we're down here lying underneath the engine.

120
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:20,031
Maybe we're doing some mechanical work, or, you know, it's a racing simulation game,

121
00:07:20,111 --> 00:07:23,653
and you've got to tune the engine, and so you're up top playing around with the things up top.

122
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:28,515
As I said, there's a whole bunch of components that go together to create,

123
00:07:29,175 --> 00:07:31,676
essentially, the Gestalt entity that is the engine.

124
00:07:34,296 --> 00:07:35,517
Now, I'll pause for a second.

125
00:07:36,618 --> 00:07:40,302
I'm not suggesting you need to always go to this level of detail.

126
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:42,585
It depends entirely upon what the experience is.

127
00:07:44,026 --> 00:07:47,410
But this is an example, this is a vehicle to discuss.

128
00:07:48,316 --> 00:07:51,497
The sorts of things we can do, and I'll give you a quick practical example.

129
00:07:51,937 --> 00:07:56,558
And if anybody's interested in this, I'm actually doing a post-mortem on this game on the Friday.

130
00:07:56,578 --> 00:07:59,079
It's the very last session on Friday for anybody who's still awake.

131
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:03,240
A game I worked on which was a sailing game, and I'm not going to go into all the details,

132
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,061
but one of the things that I had was, you are sitting in the boat, you cannot move,

133
00:08:07,722 --> 00:08:10,802
which for me is a beautifully curated experience.

134
00:08:11,363 --> 00:08:15,584
I can craft that entire experience, because I know you're not walking away, you're in the boat.

135
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:20,545
It was on Vive, which means you can lean this way and that way, etc., relative to the boat,

136
00:08:20,585 --> 00:08:25,046
you've got the boom coming by, but you could actually lean right down to the water.

137
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:30,367
So I had the sounds of the water rushing past the boat while the boat's moving,

138
00:08:30,387 --> 00:08:33,268
and I had different ones depending on the speed of the boat, so those sounds would change,

139
00:08:33,428 --> 00:08:37,589
but it was generally just that sort of general white, noisy sort of sound.

140
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:44,871
But if you leaned down, as you got closer, it would fade up a more bubbling, gurgling texture sound.

141
00:08:46,298 --> 00:08:49,802
So again, what I've given you is this kind of level of detail idea of as you get closer

142
00:08:49,862 --> 00:08:52,444
to that sound source, it's a whole different sound.

143
00:08:53,445 --> 00:08:54,966
And we can do this with all sorts of things.

144
00:08:55,006 --> 00:09:00,171
It'll be up to you per project, per thing, how important the thing is, what sort of relationship

145
00:09:00,531 --> 00:09:01,612
it needs to have with the audience.

146
00:09:02,553 --> 00:09:05,455
But this is all relevant to the scale.

147
00:09:07,541 --> 00:09:09,502
All right, so here's a really, really, really interesting one.

148
00:09:09,982 --> 00:09:12,063
Um, okay, it's a VR game. It's a driving game.

149
00:09:12,503 --> 00:09:15,225
Fantastic. So we're driving along, and we've got our interior of the car,

150
00:09:15,245 --> 00:09:16,766
and we'll get to the interior in a second,

151
00:09:16,786 --> 00:09:18,266
but before we get to the interior of the car,

152
00:09:18,847 --> 00:09:19,607
we've got to open the window.

153
00:09:22,049 --> 00:09:25,231
Okay, so what's the ramifications of opening the window in VR?

154
00:09:25,471 --> 00:09:29,694
There's one thing in VR that it's kind of like, okay, so I'm driving and the window opens.

155
00:09:29,734 --> 00:09:32,816
So now what we've got is we've got our enclosed box

156
00:09:33,036 --> 00:09:35,177
and the sound of our enclosed box has just been breached.

157
00:09:35,477 --> 00:09:36,618
We've just opened the window.

158
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:40,340
So the general sound of the engine, we've got a direct sound source coming through,

159
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:43,582
so it's not all coming through the sound dampening within the car.

160
00:09:44,082 --> 00:09:46,884
We've opened the window and now we've got the sound of wind going past.

161
00:09:47,824 --> 00:09:50,666
And also, if we're driving anywhere where there's any objects,

162
00:09:50,686 --> 00:09:51,066
we've got this...

163
00:09:53,234 --> 00:09:56,138
of trees or telegraph poles or whatever going past.

164
00:09:56,158 --> 00:09:58,801
So you've got all of that, but it's VR.

165
00:10:00,082 --> 00:10:01,764
I can stick my whole head out the window.

166
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:08,326
Now all of a sudden, with my head out the window, everything's changed.

167
00:10:08,346 --> 00:10:11,629
My entire perception of the car engine is external.

168
00:10:12,149 --> 00:10:14,931
I'm not getting any sounds traveling through the body of the car.

169
00:10:14,991 --> 00:10:19,375
But moreover, I've now got the sound of wind rushing past my head.

170
00:10:19,455 --> 00:10:21,656
And the thing I was telling you about before, about turning your head?

171
00:10:22,017 --> 00:10:25,179
Well, I've now got wind coming about my head in all different directions,

172
00:10:25,219 --> 00:10:28,241
and I can do all this. So now it's a single wind sound.

173
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:32,215
is not going to seem realistic, it's not going to seem immersive.

174
00:10:32,276 --> 00:10:38,857
You need to have multiple emitters that basically allow me to have my head inside a volume of sound.

175
00:10:41,458 --> 00:10:45,959
So opening a window in VR is really, really significant.

176
00:10:45,979 --> 00:10:47,880
So if you're working on a project and somebody sort of says,

177
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:50,280
oh yeah, it's a racing game, it's in VR, we're going to open the window,

178
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,901
you need to very quickly put your hand up and go, just let me know,

179
00:10:52,941 --> 00:10:54,261
that's going to have a pretty big impact.

180
00:10:54,621 --> 00:10:56,562
They're like, well can't you just change the sound to win?

181
00:10:56,582 --> 00:10:57,362
No.

182
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:02,234
And that is actually part of what we need to do is really advocate for,

183
00:11:03,054 --> 00:11:05,055
the more we understand about the impacts of things,

184
00:11:05,075 --> 00:11:07,936
the more we can actually communicate that with our teams.

185
00:11:08,236 --> 00:11:09,637
So when somebody goes, oh, we just want to open the window

186
00:11:09,657 --> 00:11:11,557
because we think that'd be cool, and you can just add a wind sound,

187
00:11:11,617 --> 00:11:13,658
it's like, yeah, you're going to need to give me a couple of extra weeks.

188
00:11:13,678 --> 00:11:14,858
And they're like, what?

189
00:11:16,619 --> 00:11:19,320
And now you can explain why because of all of those elements.

190
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:22,281
So there's a lot, there can be a really big impact

191
00:11:22,301 --> 00:11:25,062
from such a simple thing as saying, I want to open the window.

192
00:11:28,750 --> 00:11:29,310
Interior.

193
00:11:30,891 --> 00:11:33,533
Let's mask that out, except for a couple of areas.

194
00:11:33,794 --> 00:11:34,194
Hey, look.

195
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:36,456
Four speakers.

196
00:11:37,136 --> 00:11:38,637
I think it's actually got some more speakers somewhere else,

197
00:11:38,677 --> 00:11:39,578
but those were the easy ones.

198
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:44,542
Do we have, like, you know, GTA style,

199
00:11:44,562 --> 00:11:46,443
do we have an in-game radio playing?

200
00:11:47,044 --> 00:11:52,007
If so, speakers there, there's down here.

201
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:57,444
If I'm leaning across, you know, the speaker's getting louder, the music, etc., etc.

202
00:11:58,204 --> 00:12:00,967
Again, these are all options. I'm not saying you have to do these things.

203
00:12:01,027 --> 00:12:04,711
But if you're trying to create... The problem about something like a car,

204
00:12:05,932 --> 00:12:08,594
whilst it's the perfect thing for this discussion today,

205
00:12:08,915 --> 00:12:14,920
it's also a huge issue because every single person who might be using your experience

206
00:12:15,281 --> 00:12:18,184
knows what a car sounds like. They know what the experience is like.

207
00:12:19,088 --> 00:12:23,269
They know that when they're in their car, either they're driving or somebody else is driving,

208
00:12:23,529 --> 00:12:25,870
and they're in their car, they know there's a speaker down there,

209
00:12:25,890 --> 00:12:27,650
and there's a little speaker over there, and there's a speaker...

210
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:32,351
So if I lean across to the glove box, you know, I lean across to the glove box,

211
00:12:32,751 --> 00:12:35,552
my perception of the sounds coming out of these speakers should get softer,

212
00:12:35,772 --> 00:12:37,453
the ones coming out of there should get louder.

213
00:12:38,653 --> 00:12:42,374
If this is a game or an experience where there might be a passenger,

214
00:12:42,734 --> 00:12:45,475
then the passenger going there should muffle the door speaker.

215
00:12:46,844 --> 00:12:48,945
Theoretically, you could even go to crazy levels and go,

216
00:12:48,965 --> 00:12:51,005
well, you know, if I put my hand over where the speaker is,

217
00:12:51,545 --> 00:12:53,746
in VR, if I put my hand over a sound source

218
00:12:54,126 --> 00:12:55,726
that we know in the real world is a sound source,

219
00:12:55,766 --> 00:12:56,906
does it muffle that speaker?

220
00:12:59,287 --> 00:13:00,767
I'll get to it in a second, but down the bottom,

221
00:13:00,787 --> 00:13:03,528
there's like a coin tray that's rattling.

222
00:13:03,628 --> 00:13:06,028
If I put my hand down there, does it stop it rattling?

223
00:13:06,108 --> 00:13:07,929
Do we want that level of interaction?

224
00:13:09,229 --> 00:13:11,050
So there are so many.

225
00:13:12,007 --> 00:13:12,827
Little things.

226
00:13:13,287 --> 00:13:15,569
And the inside of the car basically has far more.

227
00:13:15,609 --> 00:13:17,470
The more I did this, I started going,

228
00:13:17,510 --> 00:13:19,271
oh wow, okay, the inside's got lots of stuff.

229
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:21,412
So here's the glove box.

230
00:13:23,073 --> 00:13:24,493
And we know what the glove box is,

231
00:13:24,513 --> 00:13:26,575
and we know, okay, well if you can open the glove box,

232
00:13:26,615 --> 00:13:28,035
there might be the sound for it going,

233
00:13:28,055 --> 00:13:30,537
and the hydraulic thing of it opening.

234
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:33,839
But even if the glove box is just like a flat texture,

235
00:13:34,179 --> 00:13:35,680
you never interact with the glove box.

236
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:39,241
That doesn't mean that we as audio people

237
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,463
can't interact with the glove box.

238
00:13:44,072 --> 00:13:49,315
Now here's where we take a step aside, and basically one of the key things that we need to do

239
00:13:50,015 --> 00:13:55,058
as audio folk is obviously we're making audio, but the reason why we're making audio is because

240
00:13:55,099 --> 00:13:57,720
we are here to support the narrative.

241
00:13:59,741 --> 00:14:06,446
So, many objects can take on the importance of a character.

242
00:14:06,886 --> 00:14:11,389
A best example for me is, as far as I'm concerned, the lead character in Star Trek.

243
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:13,671
Not the absolute latest one, but prior to that.

244
00:14:13,711 --> 00:14:16,012
The lead character in Star Trek is the USS Enterprise.

245
00:14:17,172 --> 00:14:18,653
The ship is the lead character.

246
00:14:19,113 --> 00:14:20,654
So, if this is our...

247
00:14:21,134 --> 00:14:23,155
Okay, let's just say this is a transformory thing.

248
00:14:23,175 --> 00:14:25,836
So this is kind of like Bumblebee's little sister.

249
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:27,296
Right?

250
00:14:28,364 --> 00:14:31,586
And so, Bumblebee's little sister is a little bit quirky and everything like that,

251
00:14:31,986 --> 00:14:36,488
and one of the things is that Bumblebee's little sister never opens her glovebox.

252
00:14:36,868 --> 00:14:37,569
That's private.

253
00:14:38,229 --> 00:14:41,150
And I don't mean that in a bad way, I just mean, you know, she just doesn't do that.

254
00:14:41,591 --> 00:14:44,632
Right? But what we want to do to give her a little bit of character is

255
00:14:44,872 --> 00:14:47,314
there's always something bumping around in the glovebox.

256
00:14:47,334 --> 00:14:51,656
Every time you turn a corner, there's something slide-clunk, slide-clunk, slide-clunk

257
00:14:51,896 --> 00:14:53,897
that's in the glovebox, that's moving around.

258
00:14:53,977 --> 00:14:55,538
So we've all of a sudden made...

259
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,205
A glove box that doesn't even exist, there are no assets for it, it doesn't open up,

260
00:15:00,345 --> 00:15:01,826
you will never see anything in there.

261
00:15:02,206 --> 00:15:05,588
But all of a sudden this could be something that's really intriguing and add a whole new

262
00:15:05,748 --> 00:15:06,849
element to the story.

263
00:15:06,869 --> 00:15:10,331
Because it's like, what on earth is in the glove box?

264
00:15:10,491 --> 00:15:11,792
And it's like, she never talks about the glove box.

265
00:15:12,873 --> 00:15:15,274
So all of a sudden it's like the player's going to be pulling their hair out going,

266
00:15:15,354 --> 00:15:16,895
I want to know what's in the glove box.

267
00:15:17,635 --> 00:15:21,478
And I mean, that's the sort of thing that I would actually just add initially without

268
00:15:21,498 --> 00:15:22,038
even asking.

269
00:15:22,854 --> 00:15:24,074
And then basically have the designers going,

270
00:15:24,094 --> 00:15:25,575
what's the clunk with the glove box?

271
00:15:25,615 --> 00:15:26,756
Like, there's something in the glove box.

272
00:15:29,578 --> 00:15:31,139
It's easy to show rather than tell.

273
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:32,460
And then they'd be like, what?

274
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,701
It's like, you know, it's the sort of thing that's either gonna work or not.

275
00:15:34,721 --> 00:15:36,722
And if it works, they're gonna go, okay.

276
00:15:36,982 --> 00:15:38,703
And it's like, look, she's got something in the glove box.

277
00:15:38,743 --> 00:15:39,484
It's a secret.

278
00:15:39,704 --> 00:15:43,206
And I've just given you a whole new quest for the sequel game.

279
00:15:43,707 --> 00:15:45,448
You know, find out what's in the glove box.

280
00:15:46,983 --> 00:15:50,304
But this is the point. There's a difference between, I mean character objects are really important.

281
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:54,805
The difference between, I'm in a game, I'm in an FPS game and I go through six doors.

282
00:15:55,645 --> 00:15:57,886
They all just have the normal door opening and door closing sound.

283
00:15:57,906 --> 00:16:02,086
I go through the seventh door and it's got a really, really rusty, creaky sound

284
00:16:02,126 --> 00:16:03,907
that sounds like it's going to jam or break.

285
00:16:05,587 --> 00:16:07,768
We've drawn attention to that door for a reason.

286
00:16:09,028 --> 00:16:11,988
We can do the same sort of thing with our VR interiors.

287
00:16:12,882 --> 00:16:17,506
So this is what I was talking about before, is that we've got the gear stick that you can see down there,

288
00:16:17,806 --> 00:16:20,267
and actually just behind the gear stick, it's not really very, very clear,

289
00:16:20,668 --> 00:16:22,989
that is actually another little box for coins and stuff.

290
00:16:23,685 --> 00:16:26,727
So again, are there coins in the coin box?

291
00:16:26,747 --> 00:16:28,849
You know, they rattle sometimes, and as I was saying,

292
00:16:28,889 --> 00:16:31,552
maybe you put your hand on the coin box and it stops rattling.

293
00:16:32,072 --> 00:16:35,095
But even things like the gear stick, maybe it is a VR game,

294
00:16:35,115 --> 00:16:37,677
and let's say we've got gloves or whatever, or you're using the controllers,

295
00:16:37,717 --> 00:16:40,159
and a hand comes down and is moving the gear stick.

296
00:16:40,860 --> 00:16:44,643
Do we want it to be a purely realistic sound of the gear stick?

297
00:16:44,683 --> 00:16:48,666
Are we trying to simulate reality, or are we trying to tell a story?

298
00:16:50,136 --> 00:16:58,097
My thought is if we're trying to tell a story, then again, it gives us a tendency to add a little bit more character to that gearstick.

299
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:03,518
Again, if Humblebee's little sister, you know, maybe third gear kind of grinds a little bit because, you know,

300
00:17:03,558 --> 00:17:05,579
somebody ran into her years ago and it never got fixed.

301
00:17:05,599 --> 00:17:08,539
You know, it's kind of like that sort of hip problem sort of stuff.

302
00:17:08,579 --> 00:17:10,280
It's kind of a limp but not a limp.

303
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:13,020
But again, we can put character into ordinary everyday...

304
00:17:17,582 --> 00:17:20,837
or seemingly ordinary day-to-day actions.

305
00:17:23,062 --> 00:17:26,504
But it's still a case of, when we lean closer to the coins,

306
00:17:27,024 --> 00:17:27,765
are they louder?

307
00:17:27,845 --> 00:17:30,066
If we put our hands on them, do they stop rattling?

308
00:17:30,166 --> 00:17:33,148
Maybe if I move the gear stick around a little bit,

309
00:17:33,188 --> 00:17:34,309
clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk, clunk,

310
00:17:34,329 --> 00:17:36,830
it goes into gear more easily, so I don't get that rattling.

311
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:40,052
There's so many things that can be done with sound

312
00:17:40,353 --> 00:17:42,274
to tell micro-story.

313
00:17:42,734 --> 00:17:45,616
In the same way that many games will

314
00:17:45,656 --> 00:17:48,578
have people writing little quests and stuff like that,

315
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:51,379
you can bring a lot of character to that.

316
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,501
There are various aspects and various objects in the game, depending on how you approach it.

317
00:17:55,821 --> 00:17:57,121
And I'm not saying just go crazy.

318
00:17:57,942 --> 00:18:01,282
It's always best to consult with your team.

319
00:18:02,243 --> 00:18:04,944
But your team may not even be aware that this is possible.

320
00:18:04,964 --> 00:18:08,845
They're like, oh, wow, we didn't think of this.

321
00:18:08,885 --> 00:18:10,425
We didn't think we could do that sort of stuff.

322
00:18:11,461 --> 00:18:13,503
Sometimes, that's why I'm saying sometimes you might be, you know,

323
00:18:13,583 --> 00:18:14,764
you can just show it off by doing it.

324
00:18:14,804 --> 00:18:16,005
And if they don't like it, you pull it out.

325
00:18:16,525 --> 00:18:18,126
But if they're like, oh, well, this is cool,

326
00:18:18,206 --> 00:18:19,127
what's with the glove box thing?

327
00:18:19,147 --> 00:18:20,548
And you tell them the little story about

328
00:18:20,568 --> 00:18:21,709
there's something hidden in the glove box.

329
00:18:22,069 --> 00:18:24,871
And you might find that like, that's a cool idea,

330
00:18:24,911 --> 00:18:26,913
we really like that, leave the glove box clunk in.

331
00:18:34,118 --> 00:18:36,200
Wind vents, air vents, air conditioning ducts,

332
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:36,981
whatever you want to call them.

333
00:18:37,561 --> 00:18:38,662
Again, same sort of thing.

334
00:18:39,782 --> 00:18:43,825
Do they make any noise at all? Are they always considered off?

335
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:49,470
Or is it an opportunity to enhance the sense of speed?

336
00:18:50,231 --> 00:18:56,777
Because, you know, maybe the user, the audience, the player can't control them or change them.

337
00:18:57,885 --> 00:18:59,867
But there would be a default setting.

338
00:18:59,887 --> 00:19:03,910
Now you could just say, oh, their default setting is off, they're closed, there's no sound there.

339
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:09,194
Or what you could basically have is their default setting is just, you know, the open vent to the outside air.

340
00:19:09,274 --> 00:19:11,055
No air conditioning, no heating or anything like that.

341
00:19:11,095 --> 00:19:14,117
It's just a straight flow through to the outside intakes.

342
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:17,059
Which means this car...

343
00:19:18,132 --> 00:19:22,216
When it's all sort of sealed up, and a lot of modern cars are really pretty quiet when they're all sealed up.

344
00:19:22,516 --> 00:19:23,838
And you go...

345
00:19:24,138 --> 00:19:27,161
And it's like, yeah, okay, the engine's thrashing away, but not really getting that sense of,

346
00:19:27,761 --> 00:19:31,485
I'm going fast, you know, there's a little bit less of that impact.

347
00:19:31,845 --> 00:19:37,070
And then you could just basically go, there's just a subtle sort of wind sound

348
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,433
that increases in intensity or pitch or whatever, layers, et cetera,

349
00:19:40,774 --> 00:19:42,195
as the car's going faster and faster.

350
00:19:43,944 --> 00:19:46,505
Again, whether you want to go, you can take it to extremes,

351
00:19:46,605 --> 00:19:48,546
and with Bumblebee's little sister,

352
00:19:48,626 --> 00:19:50,787
maybe she wheezes when she works too hard.

353
00:19:51,087 --> 00:19:54,809
And so one of the vents basically has got this little bit of a sort of a whistly sort of sound.

354
00:19:55,090 --> 00:19:59,172
And when she's grumpy at you, they kind of like cough at you or something like that.

355
00:19:59,212 --> 00:20:00,252
Maybe that's a way of communicating.

356
00:20:00,272 --> 00:20:03,974
I'm not suggesting again that these are must-haves,

357
00:20:04,074 --> 00:20:06,196
but my point is you can see already...

358
00:20:07,136 --> 00:20:11,882
That our interior of this car has got so much potential.

359
00:20:12,362 --> 00:20:15,526
There's so much that we can do just with the interior of a car that,

360
00:20:15,846 --> 00:20:20,051
up until now in most games, you know, and here's all the other bits and pieces.

361
00:20:20,973 --> 00:20:24,357
Um, this weird little thing down here, believe it or not, is actually the um...

362
00:20:25,112 --> 00:20:29,236
The handbrake, this is a little digital one, that slides open and closed, or doesn't.

363
00:20:29,677 --> 00:20:33,620
As I said, the handle on the glovebox, the gearstick as well and its controls.

364
00:20:34,061 --> 00:20:37,664
All the controls for the air conditioning, the radio, blah blah blah, the horn,

365
00:20:38,485 --> 00:20:39,626
the electric mirrors on the side.

366
00:20:40,847 --> 00:20:42,829
Do these things operate? Do they need to operate?

367
00:20:43,129 --> 00:20:45,932
Do you want them to operate because they might add more character?

368
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:50,621
It's not just the addition of the sounds,

369
00:20:51,482 --> 00:20:54,023
it's we are building up an environment.

370
00:20:54,043 --> 00:20:55,964
In the same way that we would look at something and go,

371
00:20:56,285 --> 00:20:58,126
I want trees over there and trees over there

372
00:20:58,166 --> 00:20:59,727
and I want that swamp to have frogs in it

373
00:20:59,747 --> 00:21:01,708
because that'll be really nice and luscious and it'll be really good

374
00:21:01,728 --> 00:21:03,169
and they'll be louder when it rains, etc.

375
00:21:03,609 --> 00:21:06,311
And at night time the birds go to sleep and all the crickets come out.

376
00:21:06,571 --> 00:21:08,212
We're building an environment.

377
00:21:08,912 --> 00:21:11,353
We're building an environment and, well, sorry,

378
00:21:12,193 --> 00:21:15,694
the game artists and level designers are building an environment.

379
00:21:16,034 --> 00:21:19,375
Generally what our job is, is to bring the environment to life.

380
00:21:20,555 --> 00:21:22,255
That's one of the key things we do.

381
00:21:22,335 --> 00:21:27,056
We take things that otherwise are often just static objects

382
00:21:27,156 --> 00:21:30,837
or just things that, just, even things sometimes that are animated.

383
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,802
You know, you see somebody who's done a really awesome animation of a dragon,

384
00:21:34,822 --> 00:21:37,123
and I've worked on projects like this where somebody's gone,

385
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,605
yeah, we really, really like the dragon, it's looking really, really cool,

386
00:21:39,625 --> 00:21:41,646
you know, it just doesn't quite have that thing, and I'm like, hang on,

387
00:21:42,186 --> 00:21:44,667
pop in the sound and everybody's like, that's the thing!

388
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:49,690
The difference between any creature, character,

389
00:21:50,711 --> 00:21:52,992
or really sort of effective giant, you know,

390
00:21:54,193 --> 00:21:56,954
ten-legged walker thing that's supposed to come over here and scare Damien,

391
00:21:57,254 --> 00:21:58,595
you know, if it's not making noise,

392
00:22:00,456 --> 00:22:05,458
It's not completely ineffectual, but it has so much less impact.

393
00:22:05,978 --> 00:22:14,161
So all of these things are potential impact and should be added into the overall consideration

394
00:22:14,301 --> 00:22:17,002
of what it is we're doing and how we're doing it.

395
00:22:19,243 --> 00:22:28,646
So the point about ha is that the car is the perfect example of an object we know and we

396
00:22:28,686 --> 00:22:29,326
understand.

397
00:22:30,612 --> 00:22:33,796
That's a really good first place for us to start.

398
00:22:33,836 --> 00:22:38,683
But even better than that, I would suggest that everybody in this room

399
00:22:39,064 --> 00:22:42,468
can get access to a car to examine it, to think about it.

400
00:22:42,869 --> 00:22:44,752
It's not like a dragon where I'm sitting there going,

401
00:22:44,812 --> 00:22:45,853
does a dragon snore?

402
00:22:46,578 --> 00:22:50,120
You know, what does it sound like when a dragon scratches her butt?

403
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:54,481
I mean, you know, is it claw on scales or does she get the claw under the scales?

404
00:22:54,501 --> 00:22:56,702
It's a bit, oh, that really feels good, you know.

405
00:22:56,762 --> 00:22:59,483
And so, you know, so those sorts of details are important.

406
00:22:59,703 --> 00:23:03,144
But my point is that those are a little bit more subjective, etc.

407
00:23:03,364 --> 00:23:04,685
We can all look at a car.

408
00:23:05,285 --> 00:23:09,667
Anybody in here who wants to try this out can immediately do some research

409
00:23:09,747 --> 00:23:12,188
and work out what stuff do I need.

410
00:23:13,129 --> 00:23:16,570
What stuff can I maybe play with and be a little bit sort of poetic with?

411
00:23:17,171 --> 00:23:19,031
What stuff is going to be overkill?

412
00:23:20,512 --> 00:23:22,513
Because you can try it out in the game or whatever,

413
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:25,494
and then you can basically get in your car and go,

414
00:23:25,854 --> 00:23:28,915
well, I'm just going to take everything out of the glove box and put one thing in there.

415
00:23:29,556 --> 00:23:31,496
Drive around and see if it goes clunk, clunk, clunk.

416
00:23:31,536 --> 00:23:33,997
How much it goes clunk. I'm going over speed humps and stuff.

417
00:23:34,377 --> 00:23:35,458
What sort of sound does it make?

418
00:23:35,738 --> 00:23:38,279
And then you can decide I'm really going to amp this up and make it...

419
00:23:39,772 --> 00:23:43,034
Dial it up to 15, because for our product right now,

420
00:23:43,394 --> 00:23:44,435
that's what we need.

421
00:23:45,595 --> 00:23:51,279
So, I guess the subtext of this session

422
00:23:52,060 --> 00:23:55,982
is a suggestion that, not just for VR,

423
00:23:56,883 --> 00:23:57,944
but it certainly helps in those,

424
00:23:59,204 --> 00:24:04,248
that using a real world, a common real world object

425
00:24:05,028 --> 00:24:06,109
as your point of reference.

426
00:24:07,063 --> 00:24:10,525
Can sometimes be really, really good, because it allows you to do research really, really easily.

427
00:24:10,565 --> 00:24:14,328
It allows you to mock things up, because you, literally, you could do something at work,

428
00:24:14,528 --> 00:24:19,892
you could take it home, you could show your husband or wife, your kids, your spouse, your partner,

429
00:24:19,952 --> 00:24:23,315
and go, so, this is kind of a mock-up of our car.

430
00:24:24,255 --> 00:24:24,856
What do you think?

431
00:24:25,957 --> 00:24:27,718
That sounds exactly like our car.

432
00:24:28,298 --> 00:24:29,539
Cool, that's a good place to start.

433
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,862
Or, no, the coin tray needs to rattle a whole bunch more.

434
00:24:35,924 --> 00:24:36,024
So.

435
00:24:38,828 --> 00:24:45,340
This has been a short, sharp, quick, and dirty info dump of...

436
00:24:46,580 --> 00:24:50,802
In some ways, not necessarily techniques, but just a mode of thinking.

437
00:24:51,243 --> 00:24:58,067
An approach where, for VR specifically, scale matters.

438
00:24:58,107 --> 00:25:03,630
And I'll leave it with one final example of, if we all had, and VR and AR works in the

439
00:25:03,670 --> 00:25:08,453
same way, to just get this point across, if we all had AR glasses on right now, and I

440
00:25:08,493 --> 00:25:14,036
basically made sure that there was a little AR robot that's walking across the table here,

441
00:25:14,056 --> 00:25:15,957
and he's this big, and he's...

442
00:25:17,171 --> 00:25:19,976
And then it jumps down onto there and we hear the clunk and then it jumps down and walks

443
00:25:20,016 --> 00:25:20,658
along a little bit more.

444
00:25:21,098 --> 00:25:25,967
But then grows to the head of the robot is up, right up in the ceiling.

445
00:25:26,709 --> 00:25:28,051
Me walking down here now.

446
00:25:29,129 --> 00:25:32,191
The little robot that was up there, one sound source for the whole robot is appropriate.

447
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,753
The robot here now, if I'm walking along next to the robot,

448
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:39,496
I want to hear the servos in the ankles, in the knees, in the hips, in the waist.

449
00:25:40,217 --> 00:25:43,579
I want to be able to lean across and go, yeah, you need to get your waist tuned

450
00:25:43,619 --> 00:25:46,701
because there's kind of a grindy rattle when you turn your waist and all that sort of stuff.

451
00:25:47,001 --> 00:25:52,065
Because the robot is now so big that my point of reference to the robot is

452
00:25:52,245 --> 00:25:54,967
I can discern all of the different areas.

453
00:25:55,007 --> 00:25:58,249
Whereas when it's this big, a single sound source is likely enough.

454
00:25:58,889 --> 00:26:02,291
So just keep that in mind with VR and AR

455
00:26:02,391 --> 00:26:03,772
that it's not just immersion,

456
00:26:03,832 --> 00:26:05,213
and immersion is really important,

457
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:07,314
but Skype will impact

458
00:26:08,935 --> 00:26:11,176
how you need to approach your projects

459
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:12,637
in a really big way,

460
00:26:13,097 --> 00:26:16,639
and by thinking in a common sort of object,

461
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,600
it will help you to sort of work your way

462
00:26:18,740 --> 00:26:21,302
through the potential challenges that you may have there.

463
00:26:22,622 --> 00:26:23,843
And that gives us a couple of minutes

464
00:26:23,863 --> 00:26:24,863
for a couple of questions if we want.

465
00:26:25,084 --> 00:26:25,864
Thank you very much, everyone.

466
00:26:35,218 --> 00:26:44,952
Have you started using any ray traced audio in any of your development for doing occlusion

467
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:47,195
or reverb related stuff?

468
00:26:47,595 --> 00:26:48,616
No, and I'll tell you why.

469
00:26:49,917 --> 00:26:52,098
It's expensive and we don't need it.

470
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,880
At least, let me qualify that a little bit.

471
00:26:55,340 --> 00:26:58,042
We don't really need it, at least not at this stage,

472
00:26:58,102 --> 00:27:01,264
because the reality is people are still getting used to VR and AR.

473
00:27:01,424 --> 00:27:05,447
And the biggest point is, is that if I'm outside in the open air

474
00:27:05,507 --> 00:27:07,648
and I walk over into that concrete shed over there,

475
00:27:07,848 --> 00:27:10,570
there's one, one key thing I need.

476
00:27:11,391 --> 00:27:12,211
That's the line there.

477
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:15,253
When I cross the line, I need a point of difference.

478
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:22,052
For most of our audiences, they are not going to understand and appreciate if that reverb

479
00:27:22,552 --> 00:27:26,535
is 100% accurate for that space, as long as reverb is on and off.

480
00:27:26,795 --> 00:27:28,156
Now, I would take it one step further.

481
00:27:28,476 --> 00:27:32,639
If it was an important part of the game or the project, what I would like to see is...

482
00:27:33,829 --> 00:27:36,392
If I'm in the centre, I get even reflections everywhere.

483
00:27:36,832 --> 00:27:39,956
When I'm close to a wall, I will get one wall closer to the others.

484
00:27:40,456 --> 00:27:42,278
I would have probably those two states.

485
00:27:42,358 --> 00:27:44,361
So obviously closer to that wall, that wall, that wall, that wall.

486
00:27:44,561 --> 00:27:49,426
But I'd basically have, I'm away from the wall, when I cross sort of 25% away, so I

487
00:27:49,466 --> 00:27:54,071
get the middle reverb, or I'm close to a wall, because then I get that really nice proximity

488
00:27:54,131 --> 00:27:55,793
effect of I am near something close.

489
00:27:56,785 --> 00:28:00,828
But ray tracing all this other stuff, I'm not saying we shouldn't have it.

490
00:28:01,148 --> 00:28:06,212
I'm saying right at the moment, I think there are far more important priorities

491
00:28:06,472 --> 00:28:08,854
than worrying about completely accurate reflections and stuff.

492
00:28:09,214 --> 00:28:09,554
Thank you.

493
00:28:09,754 --> 00:28:10,035
No worries.

494
00:28:11,838 --> 00:28:16,643
Thanks very much for the talk, very eye opening. I'm curious, if you have a sound outside the

495
00:28:16,683 --> 00:28:20,106
car, say the engine sound, right, obviously it's going to sound different if you're outside

496
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:23,690
than if you step inside the car, it'll be occluded somewhat. How would you handle a

497
00:28:23,730 --> 00:28:26,453
sound like on the window itself that kind of...

498
00:28:26,954 --> 00:28:31,097
Is in between multiple spaces, you can hear it from multiple perspectives at the same time.

499
00:28:31,117 --> 00:28:34,619
I would cover my car with a whole bunch of microphones and I would record all those different perspectives.

500
00:28:35,540 --> 00:28:39,984
Whether I use those actual recordings or not, what those do is they give me points of reference.

501
00:28:40,324 --> 00:28:43,306
That I can then go off and go, actually I don't need to have...

502
00:28:44,187 --> 00:28:45,307
10 different layers playing at once.

503
00:28:45,447 --> 00:28:48,629
I can have my indoor one, my outdoor one, and the one near the window.

504
00:28:48,649 --> 00:28:52,611
I would have the one near the window basically on kind of like a rail,

505
00:28:52,671 --> 00:28:56,412
so it sounds close to the window, because that's sort of the closest point.

506
00:28:56,472 --> 00:28:59,914
If you stick your head out the window, it kind of swivels around a little bit closer towards the engine,

507
00:29:00,294 --> 00:29:01,114
and I might filter it.

508
00:29:01,194 --> 00:29:03,716
If I could achieve the effect that I wanted with filters.

509
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:08,298
If I couldn't, then I'd just have the different recordings and play those in the different places.

510
00:29:08,558 --> 00:29:11,799
Because yes, I talked about the engine and the exhaust.

511
00:29:11,819 --> 00:29:13,279
Those were the two examples.

512
00:29:13,339 --> 00:29:15,380
But you'd also get a different sound source

513
00:29:15,400 --> 00:29:17,201
for each of the tires.

514
00:29:17,461 --> 00:29:18,361
You'd get a different sound.

515
00:29:18,581 --> 00:29:20,682
I recorded some stuff for Mercedes,

516
00:29:21,042 --> 00:29:24,924
and I literally had three microphones in the engine bay,

517
00:29:25,204 --> 00:29:26,304
one on the exhaust pipe,

518
00:29:26,724 --> 00:29:29,285
one halfway down each side of the car.

519
00:29:29,365 --> 00:29:30,565
And if you look at the way Hollywood do it,

520
00:29:30,605 --> 00:29:31,626
they go even further than that.

521
00:29:32,526 --> 00:29:32,806
Thank you.

522
00:29:33,046 --> 00:29:34,487
No worries.

523
00:29:34,567 --> 00:29:35,787
Round up. Can we have one more question?

524
00:29:36,948 --> 00:29:37,108
No?

525
00:29:38,339 --> 00:29:39,440
I'm getting a shake of the head at the back.

526
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:44,404
Give the wrap-up room.

527
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,105
You can do a wrap-up.

528
00:29:45,145 --> 00:29:47,807
I'll go outside and if anybody's got any questions, you can ask those questions there.

529
00:29:48,648 --> 00:29:51,530
The people in red, they're really important.

530
00:29:51,871 --> 00:29:54,373
If I go further, they just come up on the stage and drag me off.

531
00:29:54,893 --> 00:29:56,435
Thank you very much everyone. I hope you enjoyed it.
