1
00:00:06,633 --> 00:00:07,554
All right, everybody.

2
00:00:07,554 --> 00:00:08,614
Welcome to French 101.

3
00:00:08,614 --> 00:00:09,575
We.

4
00:00:09,575 --> 00:00:16,360
Actually, does anybody in here speak French?

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:18,942
OK, then I ordinarily start these off

6
00:00:18,942 --> 00:00:20,403
with a really terrible joke.

7
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:22,224
And I'm not going to break the cycle at GDC.

8
00:00:22,224 --> 00:00:24,606
Just some of you may not understand this one

9
00:00:24,606 --> 00:00:26,428
because it's a bad French joke.

10
00:00:26,428 --> 00:00:28,589
That there's two cats swimming across a river.

11
00:00:28,589 --> 00:00:30,471
One of them is named one, two, three.

12
00:00:30,471 --> 00:00:32,152
The other is named un, deux, trois.

13
00:00:32,152 --> 00:00:33,453
Which one makes it to the other side?

14
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,181
You're right. 1, 2, 3 cat makes it because unfortunately 1, 2, 3 cat sank.

15
00:00:39,181 --> 00:00:50,966
I'm already getting jeers from up here. They want me off the stage.

16
00:00:50,966 --> 00:00:55,868
So it's day four, everybody, and I think this is probably an apt panel for day four.

17
00:00:55,868 --> 00:00:57,829
Who's feeling just exhausted?

18
00:00:57,829 --> 00:01:01,931
Okay, okay. Hold on. Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up.

19
00:01:01,931 --> 00:01:04,592
Keep your hands up. Keep your hands up. Okay.

20
00:01:05,327 --> 00:01:07,329
For those of you who are feeling exhausted,

21
00:01:07,329 --> 00:01:10,932
keep your hands up if you've deliberately said no to things

22
00:01:10,932 --> 00:01:12,993
like parties, interviews, et cetera.

23
00:01:12,993 --> 00:01:13,954
Okay, most of you.

24
00:01:13,954 --> 00:01:15,215
Okay, that's good, that's good.

25
00:01:15,215 --> 00:01:18,798
All right, so what we're gonna do is we're gonna,

26
00:01:18,798 --> 00:01:22,681
we have this fantastic panel of industry veterans,

27
00:01:22,681 --> 00:01:26,384
and we're gonna talk about how they deal with stress,

28
00:01:26,384 --> 00:01:27,765
particularly burnout stress,

29
00:01:27,765 --> 00:01:31,088
and hopefully they're gonna have some really great tips

30
00:01:31,088 --> 00:01:32,790
for you all to do the same thing.

31
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,604
But first let's talk about, well, who I am and who I'm here with.

32
00:01:38,604 --> 00:01:43,088
My name is Dr. B. I am the clinical director of a mental health non-profit called Take

33
00:01:43,088 --> 00:01:43,568
This.

34
00:01:43,568 --> 00:01:47,652
Starting in 2012, we were actually the first mental health non-profit to serve the game

35
00:01:47,652 --> 00:01:49,114
industry.

36
00:01:49,114 --> 00:01:53,618
And our whole mission can be boiled down to it's OK to not be OK.

37
00:01:53,618 --> 00:01:57,282
And it is a, you know, basically...

38
00:01:58,473 --> 00:02:02,815
Mental health challenges are far more common than we realize,

39
00:02:02,815 --> 00:02:06,798
regardless of whether they raise to the level of a full diagnosis or not.

40
00:02:06,798 --> 00:02:10,180
And yet we're not talking about it.

41
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:17,164
One of the statistics we like to cite is from the Centers for Disease Control

42
00:02:17,164 --> 00:02:17,944
here in the United States.

43
00:02:17,944 --> 00:02:22,047
And it's roughly one in four people will be diagnosed in their lifetime.

44
00:02:24,003 --> 00:02:24,643
Think about that.

45
00:02:24,643 --> 00:02:27,025
And this is actually kind of a conservative number.

46
00:02:27,025 --> 00:02:29,347
This number does not include substance abuse disorders.

47
00:02:29,347 --> 00:02:31,849
This number does not include neurodevelopmental disorder

48
00:02:31,849 --> 00:02:33,571
like Asperger's.

49
00:02:33,571 --> 00:02:38,275
But it's still significant.

50
00:02:38,275 --> 00:02:40,096
If you don't know someone who suffers

51
00:02:40,096 --> 00:02:42,479
from a mental health diagnosis, yeah, you do.

52
00:02:42,479 --> 00:02:45,321
Yeah, you do, and they're not talking about it,

53
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:46,302
which is part of the problem.

54
00:02:46,302 --> 00:02:48,784
So take This Exists to help bring education

55
00:02:48,784 --> 00:02:50,665
to studios, to attendees,

56
00:02:50,665 --> 00:02:52,227
and we do a lot of talks like this.

57
00:02:53,057 --> 00:02:56,178
and we wanna bring awareness to all of you.

58
00:02:56,178 --> 00:02:59,559
And apparently you're all concerned about burnout, yeah?

59
00:02:59,559 --> 00:03:00,759
Yeah.

60
00:03:00,759 --> 00:03:02,320
Cause like this industry's hard or something.

61
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:02,580
Like, totally.

62
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:05,741
Who got into this industry with the dreams

63
00:03:05,741 --> 00:03:08,261
of I'm gonna make amazing games?

64
00:03:08,261 --> 00:03:09,782
I mean, obviously.

65
00:03:09,782 --> 00:03:11,962
But, and it's gonna be great,

66
00:03:11,962 --> 00:03:15,203
and I'm gonna do it in my spare time,

67
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:16,983
and I'm gonna leave it,

68
00:03:16,983 --> 00:03:21,105
I'm already getting laughter as soon as I say spare time.

69
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:24,130
Yeah, we're going to talk about that.

70
00:03:24,130 --> 00:03:25,090
But what is burnout?

71
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:28,612
Like, no, seriously, I'm asking you, what is burnout?

72
00:03:28,612 --> 00:03:31,272
Somebody give me a guess.

73
00:03:31,272 --> 00:03:32,753
Because we use the term all the time.

74
00:03:32,753 --> 00:03:35,274
And I want to make sure we're all on the same page.

75
00:03:35,274 --> 00:03:36,914
Yes, you in the back with the red sleeves.

76
00:03:36,914 --> 00:03:39,055
It is when your blood completely, suddenly,

77
00:03:39,055 --> 00:03:40,416
puts a stop that you can't stop.

78
00:03:51,172 --> 00:03:53,373
So it's when your mind completely and suddenly stops

79
00:03:53,373 --> 00:03:54,714
and you cannot think anymore.

80
00:03:54,714 --> 00:03:56,575
Okay, who else?

81
00:03:56,575 --> 00:03:57,456
Yes.

82
00:03:57,456 --> 00:04:00,598
Deep depression.

83
00:04:00,598 --> 00:04:08,023
Let's go over to, yes.

84
00:04:08,023 --> 00:04:11,605
100% for too long to the point that you cannot go anymore.

85
00:04:11,605 --> 00:04:13,867
Way back in the corner.

86
00:04:13,867 --> 00:04:16,789
Cannot function.

87
00:04:16,789 --> 00:04:19,371
Well, that just, that summarizes it all.

88
00:04:19,371 --> 00:04:19,891
Yes.

89
00:04:23,782 --> 00:04:25,443
Your work starts to become terrible.

90
00:04:25,443 --> 00:04:26,484
So you can't think, okay, so.

91
00:04:26,484 --> 00:04:30,067
I love that I'm getting such a great response on day four.

92
00:04:30,067 --> 00:04:34,852
Unless you're all stretching and I just don't know it.

93
00:04:34,852 --> 00:04:39,476
Cause I don't know, you know, got to keep that, nevermind.

94
00:04:39,476 --> 00:04:45,241
All of you are correct, in part.

95
00:04:45,241 --> 00:04:47,203
Burnout is all of these things.

96
00:04:47,203 --> 00:04:49,545
It's not, first of all, it's kind of like impostor syndrome.

97
00:04:49,545 --> 00:04:50,766
It's not a diagnosis.

98
00:04:52,064 --> 00:04:56,248
All right, imposter syndrome isn't actually a syndrome.

99
00:04:56,248 --> 00:05:00,351
But burnout is something that is a unique, long-term form

100
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:03,494
of stress that affects our cognition, our ability

101
00:05:03,494 --> 00:05:06,096
to think, affects our mood.

102
00:05:06,096 --> 00:05:09,959
So deep depression touches on that.

103
00:05:09,959 --> 00:05:12,201
It affects our functioning.

104
00:05:12,201 --> 00:05:15,544
And it also affects our career longevity.

105
00:05:15,544 --> 00:05:18,907
And incidentally.

106
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:23,152
It has correlates with all of these things.

107
00:05:24,912 --> 00:05:27,874
Now part of the reason this is going to be really important

108
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:30,796
for studios, if you are a manager at a studio,

109
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,598
big, small, somewhere in between, doesn't matter,

110
00:05:33,598 --> 00:05:36,840
pay attention to this because turnover rates

111
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,141
are a substantive cost.

112
00:05:39,141 --> 00:05:43,164
A statistic that we cited in a white paper

113
00:05:43,164 --> 00:05:45,585
that TakeThis wrote for the IGDA in 2016

114
00:05:45,585 --> 00:05:49,208
called Crunch Hertz, cited that the cost,

115
00:05:49,208 --> 00:05:51,989
just the cost of retraining a new employee

116
00:05:51,989 --> 00:05:53,170
is 20% of their annual salary.

117
00:05:54,258 --> 00:05:57,281
That's not to even mention losses in productivity

118
00:05:57,281 --> 00:06:00,804
due to retraining time.

119
00:06:00,804 --> 00:06:03,927
In the United States alone,

120
00:06:03,927 --> 00:06:06,050
productivity costs related to depression

121
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:11,235
were in the $44 billion range per year.

122
00:06:11,235 --> 00:06:14,878
So we want to optimize our spaces.

123
00:06:16,658 --> 00:06:19,059
And I believe it was the most recent

124
00:06:19,059 --> 00:06:22,720
developer satisfaction survey that the IGDA put out

125
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,961
that roughly two out of three developers

126
00:06:24,961 --> 00:06:27,162
and game industry employees dropped by their 10th year.

127
00:06:27,162 --> 00:06:29,642
We don't have many veterans in this industry.

128
00:06:29,642 --> 00:06:32,563
And we want that, because we want that expertise.

129
00:06:32,563 --> 00:06:36,704
And so we need to eliminate this stuff.

130
00:06:36,704 --> 00:06:38,885
But since I mentioned Crunch.

131
00:06:44,475 --> 00:06:48,978
Okay, well again, since you all were in the mood for raising hands,

132
00:06:48,978 --> 00:06:50,599
or stretching, I don't know, I'm not going to judge,

133
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,062
but what happens to burnout if we just work less hard?

134
00:06:54,062 --> 00:06:54,202
Yes.

135
00:06:54,202 --> 00:06:57,485
You're probably working less hard for around the same amount of time,

136
00:06:57,485 --> 00:07:06,471
so you're probably just as stressed as you were instead of doing less.

137
00:07:06,471 --> 00:07:09,494
So you're probably working just as hard for less amount of time,

138
00:07:09,494 --> 00:07:12,676
and you feel just as stressed, if we just eliminate the work hours.

139
00:07:12,676 --> 00:07:13,256
Okay, yes.

140
00:07:17,462 --> 00:07:19,763
You start losing momentum if you back off.

141
00:07:19,763 --> 00:07:19,844
Okay.

142
00:07:19,844 --> 00:07:22,085
And what was that?

143
00:07:22,085 --> 00:07:29,849
From audience, and benefits me, but my work fails.

144
00:07:29,849 --> 00:07:31,250
Benefits you, but your work fails.

145
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:33,291
So when you're watching your numbers,

146
00:07:33,291 --> 00:07:36,133
and you're looking at ratings and all of that,

147
00:07:36,133 --> 00:07:36,993
and what happens then?

148
00:07:36,993 --> 00:07:38,134
I mean, that's terrifying.

149
00:07:38,134 --> 00:07:38,454
Yes.

150
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,951
You start to get stressed about what you don't have done.

151
00:07:44,951 --> 00:07:47,773
Oh boy, if I had a nickel for every time I heard that one.

152
00:07:47,773 --> 00:07:48,173
Yes.

153
00:07:48,173 --> 00:07:50,195
You're less likely to ship.

154
00:07:50,195 --> 00:07:54,458
You're less likely to ship if you don't work constantly.

155
00:07:54,458 --> 00:07:58,380
You read our paper, seriously.

156
00:07:58,380 --> 00:08:01,983
Actually, over studios who regularly use Crunch,

157
00:08:01,983 --> 00:08:04,524
there is a correlation with lowered Metacritic scores.

158
00:08:04,524 --> 00:08:04,885
Yeah.

159
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:04,965
Yes.

160
00:08:12,272 --> 00:08:15,314
but everyone else is probably gonna stay longer

161
00:08:15,314 --> 00:08:17,135
and people will start to be intelligent.

162
00:08:17,135 --> 00:08:18,156
Okay, so there's fear.

163
00:08:18,156 --> 00:08:22,059
There's fear of a lack of progress in your career

164
00:08:22,059 --> 00:08:23,840
because your peers and your superiors

165
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,181
are going to be looking down on you if you work less hours.

166
00:08:26,181 --> 00:08:27,522
Well, what happens to burnout?

167
00:08:27,522 --> 00:08:27,682
Yes?

168
00:08:27,682 --> 00:08:28,503
Guilt.

169
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:28,823
Guilt?

170
00:08:28,823 --> 00:08:32,566
Like an exaggeration.

171
00:08:32,566 --> 00:08:34,847
Oh boy.

172
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:36,308
We're opening up a whole can of worms.

173
00:08:36,308 --> 00:08:37,789
Didn't know this was gonna turn into group therapy,

174
00:08:37,789 --> 00:08:40,371
did ya?

175
00:08:40,371 --> 00:08:40,611
Yes.

176
00:08:44,193 --> 00:08:49,515
So you can still do harder and the fact that you're choosing not to to choose your health over your actual output,

177
00:08:49,515 --> 00:08:51,956
does it make you feel guilty or self-pity?

178
00:08:51,956 --> 00:08:54,017
So we hear negativity about self, negativity about work, guilt, fear. Yes.

179
00:08:54,017 --> 00:08:55,618
I would say like it's kind of like an interesting trap, right?

180
00:08:55,618 --> 00:08:58,900
Because if you get burned out, that's basically a form of depression in my opinion.

181
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:05,143
So you're doing that to counterbalance the fact that you've been working so hard.

182
00:09:05,143 --> 00:09:11,066
But then if you feel bad that, you know, you haven't really been getting any work done.

183
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:19,857
So to summarize this, burnout's a form of depression,

184
00:09:19,857 --> 00:09:21,697
and you work harder to beat the depression,

185
00:09:21,697 --> 00:09:23,838
but then you get more depressed about working hard

186
00:09:23,838 --> 00:09:25,299
and your work's not as good

187
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,860
because you can't think it straight and phew.

188
00:09:27,860 --> 00:09:31,001
Okay, no one else has experienced that, right?

189
00:09:31,001 --> 00:09:34,082
Okay, well let's talk about why it's not just

190
00:09:34,082 --> 00:09:36,643
a simple matter of working less hours,

191
00:09:36,643 --> 00:09:38,083
and you're all touching on this.

192
00:09:39,033 --> 00:09:45,037
because burnout is not just a matter of exhaustion.

193
00:09:45,037 --> 00:09:47,799
Sure, burnout, exhaustion is a part of it,

194
00:09:47,799 --> 00:09:50,301
but it's not the only part, okay?

195
00:09:50,301 --> 00:09:54,163
There's two other components based on a model

196
00:09:54,163 --> 00:09:56,105
that's been in use for a couple of decades.

197
00:09:56,105 --> 00:10:02,009
That it's exhaustion, it is cynicism.

198
00:10:02,009 --> 00:10:04,650
So in other words, just I don't care.

199
00:10:04,650 --> 00:10:06,652
I don't care about you, I don't care about this.

200
00:10:07,627 --> 00:10:09,228
You know, who likes working around the person

201
00:10:09,228 --> 00:10:12,490
who's always negative all the time?

202
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:15,792
God, I'm glad nobody raised their hand.

203
00:10:15,792 --> 00:10:18,134
God, oh yeah, but it's a drain on you,

204
00:10:18,134 --> 00:10:19,895
it's a drain on the team, it's a drain on,

205
00:10:19,895 --> 00:10:21,516
oh, forgot I had that on.

206
00:10:21,516 --> 00:10:23,898
They're so tiny, the lav mics.

207
00:10:23,898 --> 00:10:31,843
But it becomes a trap of negativity.

208
00:10:31,843 --> 00:10:34,005
But also, there's an interrelated idea

209
00:10:34,005 --> 00:10:35,746
of a sense of ineffectiveness.

210
00:10:38,155 --> 00:10:40,757
Do we feel like our work is producing anything?

211
00:10:40,757 --> 00:10:43,139
Do we have a purpose?

212
00:10:43,139 --> 00:10:45,861
And the solutions to burnout have to tap

213
00:10:45,861 --> 00:10:47,062
into all of these things.

214
00:10:47,062 --> 00:10:50,504
Like how discouraging is it when you're working

215
00:10:50,504 --> 00:10:58,090
on a project so close to completion, canceled?

216
00:10:58,090 --> 00:11:00,311
Anybody experience that?

217
00:11:00,311 --> 00:11:02,033
Yeah, yeah.

218
00:11:02,763 --> 00:11:05,525
I think some friends of mine, and I won't say which studio,

219
00:11:05,525 --> 00:11:08,286
but they had one they were working on for five years.

220
00:11:08,286 --> 00:11:10,808
And right before it was about to ship, boom, canceled.

221
00:11:10,808 --> 00:11:12,729
How demoralizing is that?

222
00:11:12,729 --> 00:11:15,370
How ineffective do you feel in your job,

223
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:18,192
where all the five years of work, nothing?

224
00:11:18,192 --> 00:11:21,093
How negative are you going to feel

225
00:11:21,093 --> 00:11:22,114
about your next experience?

226
00:11:22,114 --> 00:11:24,255
And also how exhausted.

227
00:11:24,255 --> 00:11:27,696
So this is all of the above coming into one.

228
00:11:28,953 --> 00:11:31,175
And that's really what burnout is.

229
00:11:31,175 --> 00:11:35,157
Now, a couple of things we want to talk about in this

230
00:11:35,157 --> 00:11:36,678
is also self-doubt.

231
00:11:36,678 --> 00:11:38,979
Self-doubt, unhealthy self-doubt.

232
00:11:38,979 --> 00:11:41,661
I mean, if I, in my current physical state,

233
00:11:41,661 --> 00:11:45,163
decide I want to go free climb El Capitan,

234
00:11:45,163 --> 00:11:50,126
and there's a part of my brain that goes, no.

235
00:11:50,126 --> 00:11:52,387
No.

236
00:11:52,387 --> 00:11:55,249
Let's ignore my crippling phobia of heights for a moment.

237
00:11:56,851 --> 00:11:58,272
and I just couldn't do it physically.

238
00:11:58,272 --> 00:12:00,234
There are healthy forms of self-doubt,

239
00:12:00,234 --> 00:12:02,836
but other forms of self-doubt are unrealistic,

240
00:12:02,836 --> 00:12:04,878
and that produces a sense of inefficacy.

241
00:12:07,691 --> 00:12:09,192
So all of this is interrelated.

242
00:12:09,192 --> 00:12:11,413
All of the topics that are commonly talked about

243
00:12:11,413 --> 00:12:16,496
in terms of the stressors of being in the game space

244
00:12:16,496 --> 00:12:18,397
are interrelated and contribute.

245
00:12:18,397 --> 00:12:20,598
We can't just focus on one to find solutions.

246
00:12:20,598 --> 00:12:22,699
We need to focus on purpose.

247
00:12:22,699 --> 00:12:25,961
We need to focus on investment in the product.

248
00:12:25,961 --> 00:12:28,922
We need to focus on reasonable working hours

249
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:30,343
because your cognitive,

250
00:12:31,327 --> 00:12:32,427
I know it feels weird.

251
00:12:32,427 --> 00:12:35,189
I heard somebody say, I lose my motivation.

252
00:12:35,189 --> 00:12:37,251
You feel like you lose your motivation?

253
00:12:37,251 --> 00:12:38,632
Well, most of us.

254
00:12:38,632 --> 00:12:41,073
I get weirdly amped after a while,

255
00:12:41,073 --> 00:12:42,715
but even I have my limits.

256
00:12:42,715 --> 00:12:46,657
Because of this, there's another thing called,

257
00:12:46,657 --> 00:12:47,938
technical term is allostatic load.

258
00:12:47,938 --> 00:12:49,399
Don't have to remember that.

259
00:12:49,399 --> 00:12:52,942
But basically, think of a thermostat, okay?

260
00:12:52,942 --> 00:12:54,563
Our bodies are remarkably adaptive.

261
00:12:54,563 --> 00:12:57,565
Now, if you leave the door open in your house,

262
00:12:57,565 --> 00:12:59,726
and it's New England in the winter,

263
00:13:01,175 --> 00:13:03,376
your thermostat is gonna start to work overtime.

264
00:13:03,376 --> 00:13:05,637
For those of you who may be from outside of the US,

265
00:13:05,637 --> 00:13:08,499
New England is cold.

266
00:13:08,499 --> 00:13:11,040
I'm from the other side of the country in Seattle,

267
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:13,701
so I never heard of this term winterizing your house,

268
00:13:13,701 --> 00:13:15,042
but apparently it's a thing.

269
00:13:15,042 --> 00:13:19,304
We have rain, they have blizzards.

270
00:13:19,304 --> 00:13:22,025
And so your door is open, your heater is going to try

271
00:13:22,025 --> 00:13:23,926
and maintain the temperature in your house.

272
00:13:23,926 --> 00:13:25,146
So it's gonna kick into high gear,

273
00:13:25,146 --> 00:13:26,427
and it's gonna do a good job for a while,

274
00:13:26,427 --> 00:13:27,347
but it's gonna burn out.

275
00:13:27,347 --> 00:13:29,508
Our bodies are no different.

276
00:13:30,507 --> 00:13:32,589
And we need to regulate that a little bit better.

277
00:13:32,589 --> 00:13:35,071
But once it gets used to it, it's hard to come back down.

278
00:13:35,071 --> 00:13:37,673
So we need to have preventative measures as well.

279
00:13:37,673 --> 00:13:40,895
And that's what these lovely folks here

280
00:13:40,895 --> 00:13:46,179
are going to talk about, how they have maintained success

281
00:13:46,179 --> 00:13:49,641
in this industry for as long as they have.

282
00:13:49,641 --> 00:13:54,705
And I'm going to ask everybody to introduce themselves.

283
00:13:54,705 --> 00:13:56,567
And unfortunately, one of our panelists

284
00:13:58,072 --> 00:14:01,493
security at the airport, just unexpectedly long,

285
00:14:01,493 --> 00:14:03,974
missed his flight and was unable to be here with us.

286
00:14:03,974 --> 00:14:05,655
But he gave me some great written answers

287
00:14:05,655 --> 00:14:07,295
that I may be cheating and reading off later.

288
00:14:07,295 --> 00:14:10,717
But, who are you, what do you do,

289
00:14:10,717 --> 00:14:11,717
how long you been doing it?

290
00:14:12,512 --> 00:14:14,794
Okay, so I'm Kate Edwards.

291
00:14:14,794 --> 00:14:18,697
I'm a geographer, and I've been in the industry for 26 years.

292
00:14:18,697 --> 00:14:21,780
I do culturalization work, which means I help game developers

293
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:24,042
avoid political and cultural mistakes in their content

294
00:14:24,042 --> 00:14:26,544
that gets them banned by governments

295
00:14:26,544 --> 00:14:28,686
and has consumer uprisings and stuff like that.

296
00:14:28,686 --> 00:14:30,187
I did that at Microsoft for 13 years,

297
00:14:30,187 --> 00:14:33,309
and I've been self-employed ever since.

298
00:14:33,309 --> 00:14:35,912
In my last 10 years or so in the industry,

299
00:14:35,912 --> 00:14:38,293
I've gotten very involved in advocacy issues.

300
00:14:38,293 --> 00:14:40,355
I ran the IGDA for five years.

301
00:14:40,875 --> 00:14:43,116
As the executive director, I left in 2017.

302
00:14:43,116 --> 00:14:45,836
And since then, I've been very active

303
00:14:45,836 --> 00:14:49,097
in a lot of advocacy issues, including unionization

304
00:14:49,097 --> 00:14:52,838
and creating a legal defense fund

305
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:54,418
and things of that nature.

306
00:14:54,418 --> 00:14:54,998
You know, you can applaud.

307
00:14:54,998 --> 00:15:03,020
This is already an audience participation panel.

308
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,860
If you feel free to applaud, you know,

309
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:06,240
spontaneously, you go for it.

310
00:15:10,340 --> 00:15:12,663
I know where my hecklers are.

311
00:15:12,663 --> 00:15:14,385
So I'm David Ettory.

312
00:15:14,385 --> 00:15:16,427
I'm the CEO and co-founder of Spry Fox.

313
00:15:16,427 --> 00:15:18,930
And we've made games like Triple Town, Alpha Bear,

314
00:15:18,930 --> 00:15:22,414
Bushido Bear, Roman The Mad God, Steambirds.

315
00:15:22,414 --> 00:15:24,898
Any of y'all have played any of those?

316
00:15:24,898 --> 00:15:25,939
And yeah, happy to be here.

317
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:38,001
I'm Amir Rao. I'm the studio director and co-founder of Supergiant Games. We're an 18-person

318
00:15:38,001 --> 00:15:42,543
independent game company here in San Francisco. We made Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and we're

319
00:15:42,543 --> 00:15:51,225
working on a game called Hades right now.

320
00:15:51,225 --> 00:15:57,407
And missing is Tommy Rufenes, who is the CEO of Team Meat. They have some really cool stuff

321
00:15:57,407 --> 00:15:59,428
for Meat Boy coming out very soon, I hear.

322
00:16:00,374 --> 00:16:03,815
And I'm Dr. B, the clinical director of Take This.

323
00:16:03,815 --> 00:16:04,935
I am not a developer.

324
00:16:04,935 --> 00:16:06,695
I'm actually a doctor of clinical psychology.

325
00:16:06,695 --> 00:16:11,837
And so for you all, so when have you experienced

326
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,957
any of the things we talked about

327
00:16:13,957 --> 00:16:19,198
in terms of negativity, exhaustion,

328
00:16:19,198 --> 00:16:21,299
a sense of inefficacy in your work,

329
00:16:21,299 --> 00:16:22,699
and how do you deal with it?

330
00:16:22,699 --> 00:16:23,639
You wanna start?

331
00:16:23,639 --> 00:16:23,679
Oh.

332
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:23,779
Okay.

333
00:16:23,779 --> 00:16:23,819
Ah.

334
00:16:30,644 --> 00:16:38,891
So I guess for me, I view that form of exhaustion

335
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:45,697
as the potentially inevitable outcome

336
00:16:45,697 --> 00:16:50,101
of a passionate point of view on your work.

337
00:16:50,101 --> 00:16:54,145
So for me, when I have felt that way,

338
00:16:55,657 --> 00:16:58,579
My own view on it, looking backwards now,

339
00:16:58,579 --> 00:17:01,101
because most of this happened much earlier,

340
00:17:01,101 --> 00:17:03,582
is that it was like me understanding

341
00:17:03,582 --> 00:17:05,564
and learning what my limits were.

342
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:07,185
I had no other way of discovering them,

343
00:17:07,185 --> 00:17:08,606
no matter if I come to this panel or not,

344
00:17:08,606 --> 00:17:12,789
than to work the way I did to find out

345
00:17:12,789 --> 00:17:16,352
what I was capable of and where I might break.

346
00:17:16,352 --> 00:17:20,054
So in my experience, I worked a lot.

347
00:17:22,074 --> 00:17:23,876
especially on something like Bastion,

348
00:17:23,876 --> 00:17:25,777
I think we were living in a living room of a house,

349
00:17:25,777 --> 00:17:28,420
we're working all the time.

350
00:17:28,420 --> 00:17:30,922
But we were also like kind of young

351
00:17:30,922 --> 00:17:33,924
and didn't have anywhere else to be.

352
00:17:33,924 --> 00:17:37,507
So, I try to be kind to myself

353
00:17:37,507 --> 00:17:40,110
in the retrospect of all that stuff.

354
00:17:40,110 --> 00:17:42,712
I've definitely pushed myself too hard.

355
00:17:42,712 --> 00:17:46,875
I've made mistakes that,

356
00:17:46,875 --> 00:17:48,797
in understanding my own limits.

357
00:17:48,797 --> 00:17:49,177
But that's a,

358
00:17:50,517 --> 00:17:55,740
I think the hard thing about that stuff is it's a recurring lesson that you end up having

359
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:58,921
to sometimes relearn every time you might get...

360
00:17:58,921 --> 00:18:02,643
I mean I think we all want to be...

361
00:18:02,643 --> 00:18:06,245
I think a lot of us are drawn to this work because we are like passionately consumed

362
00:18:06,245 --> 00:18:06,925
by it.

363
00:18:06,925 --> 00:18:12,168
And we sometimes want a job that is so creatively fulfilling it does not fit inside 40 hours.

364
00:18:12,832 --> 00:18:20,658
And I think that that sometimes leads to the types of things that you're talking about which is sad because

365
00:18:20,658 --> 00:18:24,682
It started like from a place of of actual like joy and engagement

366
00:18:24,682 --> 00:18:33,028
So you're talking about basically a constant readjustment of your expectations in in learning from your failures

367
00:18:33,028 --> 00:18:37,732
Yeah, basically I'm trying to say is like I haven't fixed or solve this

368
00:18:37,732 --> 00:18:37,892
like

369
00:18:37,892 --> 00:18:41,155
This is like an ongoing part of you know our lives

370
00:18:41,155 --> 00:18:41,795
You know we don't

371
00:18:42,215 --> 00:18:44,037
We're not at a giant company.

372
00:18:44,037 --> 00:18:46,719
There isn't someone who's bringing in tubs of food and

373
00:18:46,719 --> 00:18:49,422
implying that we should all be working late.

374
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:50,423
It's not that kind of thing.

375
00:18:50,423 --> 00:18:53,526
It's a small group of people who are passionately invested

376
00:18:53,526 --> 00:18:56,068
in the work we're doing.

377
00:18:56,068 --> 00:19:01,053
And how much of their life is a part of work is a constant

378
00:19:01,053 --> 00:19:04,676
exchange based on what's going on in their life and what's

379
00:19:04,676 --> 00:19:05,137
going on at work.

380
00:19:07,852 --> 00:19:12,976
So I've experienced, I think, two very different forms of burnout, but both pretty nasty.

381
00:19:12,976 --> 00:19:17,140
One of them was, like, way back in, I don't remember, it was 2011 or 2012 or something,

382
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:23,485
and we had, it was on Realm of the Mad God, actually, we had, for a fairly arbitrary set of reasons,

383
00:19:23,485 --> 00:19:29,630
five weeks to make the game way better, or we were screwed.

384
00:19:29,630 --> 00:19:34,554
And so I worked a hundred hours or more every week for five weeks.

385
00:19:35,294 --> 00:19:37,175
And it was just like Amir was saying,

386
00:19:37,175 --> 00:19:38,296
that at the end of that it was like,

387
00:19:38,296 --> 00:19:40,077
oh, that's, I found my limit.

388
00:19:40,077 --> 00:19:42,739
Like I ran all the way up to the edge of the cliff,

389
00:19:42,739 --> 00:19:44,740
very nearly threw myself over it,

390
00:19:44,740 --> 00:19:46,141
and then thankfully pulled back,

391
00:19:46,141 --> 00:19:47,642
and was like, I'm never doing that again.

392
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,283
Like I was a broken shell of a human

393
00:19:49,283 --> 00:19:50,704
at the end of that five week period.

394
00:19:50,704 --> 00:19:53,966
And then the other kind of burnout is very different,

395
00:19:53,966 --> 00:19:55,707
but just as nasty, and it's the,

396
00:19:55,707 --> 00:19:57,588
when you work on something, even if you, you know,

397
00:19:58,602 --> 00:20:00,782
you work on it for reasonable hours,

398
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:01,962
and not more than 40 hours a week,

399
00:20:01,962 --> 00:20:02,722
and everything's hunky-dory,

400
00:20:02,722 --> 00:20:04,263
but then you ship it and it fails,

401
00:20:04,263 --> 00:20:05,983
and particularly if it fails for reasons

402
00:20:05,983 --> 00:20:07,343
that you feel like were not in your control,

403
00:20:07,343 --> 00:20:09,644
which is something that's gonna happen a lot in games.

404
00:20:09,644 --> 00:20:11,144
You'll look at it and you'll be like,

405
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:14,284
I did my best, my game is good, it still didn't succeed,

406
00:20:14,284 --> 00:20:16,705
which is a super common story,

407
00:20:16,705 --> 00:20:18,265
every time that happens,

408
00:20:18,265 --> 00:20:21,046
and thankfully it hasn't happened too many times,

409
00:20:21,046 --> 00:20:25,446
but when it does, you just feel the life sucked out of you.

410
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:26,967
And there's a period of time where you're like,

411
00:20:27,829 --> 00:20:29,651
why am I doing this?

412
00:20:29,651 --> 00:20:33,014
And it happens to you even if you have made,

413
00:20:33,014 --> 00:20:33,995
like I am very lucky,

414
00:20:33,995 --> 00:20:35,837
and I use the word luck very intentionally.

415
00:20:35,837 --> 00:20:38,960
Like yeah, I work hard and all that stuff,

416
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:42,323
but to have as many successful games as Firefox has had

417
00:20:42,323 --> 00:20:43,884
requires a lot of luck,

418
00:20:43,884 --> 00:20:47,788
in addition to skill and sweat and all that.

419
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,550
And it doesn't matter.

420
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,692
Like I have, even with all the number,

421
00:20:52,126 --> 00:20:55,893
you know, I think we have like five games that have been played by several million people,

422
00:20:55,893 --> 00:20:58,939
like, and it doesn't matter, when a game fails, you still take it super personally,

423
00:20:58,939 --> 00:21:03,146
and it's like, and it makes you want to quit. So yeah, those are my two burnouts.

424
00:21:04,377 --> 00:21:07,339
I think from my perspective, because my job has been a little different.

425
00:21:07,339 --> 00:21:10,740
I mean, I have, I've been involved in crunch episodes with different teams,

426
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:13,522
because I'm more an advisory role to a lot of these teams.

427
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:16,083
I have a choice whether to crunch or not.

428
00:21:16,083 --> 00:21:20,065
When I created my geopolitical team at Microsoft to handle this kind of work,

429
00:21:20,065 --> 00:21:23,467
I made sure that my team never worked ridiculous hours,

430
00:21:23,467 --> 00:21:27,309
even though at the time Microsoft was kind of insisting on pretty long hours

431
00:21:27,309 --> 00:21:29,810
for different teams, especially if you're like a core programming team.

432
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:31,671
And I just said that we don't work that way here.

433
00:21:32,031 --> 00:21:34,893
I'll take the heat for it, but my people, you go home.

434
00:21:34,893 --> 00:21:39,836
But a lot of my burnout, well, let me ask this question.

435
00:21:39,836 --> 00:21:43,038
How many people here consider themselves an introvert?

436
00:21:43,038 --> 00:21:45,760
Of course, yeah, we're the game industry.

437
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,080
So I do, too.

438
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:48,182
I mean, I can take Myers-Briggs or whatever else,

439
00:21:48,182 --> 00:21:50,383
and it always comes out an I something.

440
00:21:50,383 --> 00:21:54,286
I can fake extroversion really well now.

441
00:21:54,286 --> 00:21:56,787
But one of the biggest challenges

442
00:21:56,787 --> 00:21:59,009
I always had in my career was people burnout.

443
00:21:59,689 --> 00:22:04,811
It's dealing with people, and I'm not saying it's just because they're incompetent.

444
00:22:04,811 --> 00:22:07,972
Not everyone's incompetent, but there's people who just have different visions,

445
00:22:07,972 --> 00:22:12,474
or they pull you in a different direction, or they are incompetent.

446
00:22:12,474 --> 00:22:15,355
There's those people too, let's face it.

447
00:22:15,355 --> 00:22:19,637
And it's just having to deal with that kind of pressure of being in an organization.

448
00:22:19,637 --> 00:22:22,918
So I guess part of it is what I face a lot is organizational burnout.

449
00:22:22,918 --> 00:22:26,019
It's like being in this organization that might be dysfunctional.

450
00:22:26,019 --> 00:22:28,640
Even though you love your function, you love what you do,

451
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:28,840
you love.

452
00:22:29,100 --> 00:22:30,181
whatever job you're doing, but you just,

453
00:22:30,181 --> 00:22:31,763
the organization you're in, just, ugh,

454
00:22:31,763 --> 00:22:34,825
it's just you wish it could be better

455
00:22:34,825 --> 00:22:37,027
in multiple attempts with management and all that,

456
00:22:37,027 --> 00:22:39,009
just don't make it better.

457
00:22:39,009 --> 00:22:42,592
And so I find, when I look back over my career,

458
00:22:42,592 --> 00:22:45,474
that's usually all the inflection points I've had

459
00:22:45,474 --> 00:22:49,558
where I've left a company or done something different,

460
00:22:49,558 --> 00:22:51,639
made a major shift, was always because

461
00:22:51,639 --> 00:22:53,881
of a interpersonal thing.

462
00:22:53,881 --> 00:22:56,063
It was always because either the organization

463
00:22:56,063 --> 00:22:57,464
burned me out, like Microsoft,

464
00:22:57,845 --> 00:23:00,628
The work that I did at Microsoft, I love my work.

465
00:23:00,628 --> 00:23:04,572
I've been doing it for 30 years now, and I still love it every day.

466
00:23:04,572 --> 00:23:07,995
I got tired of doing it there for many reasons.

467
00:23:07,995 --> 00:23:09,697
And so I'm just like, I have to get out of here.

468
00:23:09,697 --> 00:23:12,520
I have to do something else, do it somewhere else.

469
00:23:13,103 --> 00:23:20,007
And so that's often the case for me, is you just kind of reach this point where I can't do it here anymore.

470
00:23:20,007 --> 00:23:22,409
You hit walls and everything.

471
00:23:22,409 --> 00:23:25,551
You know, and along with that comes emotional burnout, too.

472
00:23:25,551 --> 00:23:29,773
It's like when I created this geopolitical team, it took me seven months.

473
00:23:29,773 --> 00:23:35,757
I wrote a proposal because we had this big incident happen in Korea, and it inspired me to create this team.

474
00:23:35,757 --> 00:23:42,461
I had to shop it around to five different VPs before I finally got approval, and every one of those rejections was very difficult.

475
00:23:42,622 --> 00:23:44,023
I'm like, why can't they understand?

476
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:46,024
This is a great idea.

477
00:23:46,024 --> 00:23:48,086
Then finally, the last VP who approved it,

478
00:23:48,086 --> 00:23:49,707
approved it in five minutes.

479
00:23:49,707 --> 00:23:52,069
And that's because he was not from the US.

480
00:23:52,069 --> 00:23:55,492
He was the only VP I talked to who was not from the US.

481
00:23:55,492 --> 00:23:57,274
He's from South Africa.

482
00:23:57,274 --> 00:23:58,835
And his first answer was, I thought

483
00:23:58,835 --> 00:24:00,877
we're doing this already.

484
00:24:00,877 --> 00:24:03,339
So he's like, yes, we need to do this.

485
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:06,441
So I think for me, I've had less of the physical burnout

486
00:24:06,441 --> 00:24:09,704
episodes, but much more of the interpersonal.

487
00:24:10,204 --> 00:24:14,166
organizational kind of burnout episodes that have been pretty trying at times.

488
00:24:14,166 --> 00:24:19,008
Well, and it's interesting for me to think about all the different positions that you all have,

489
00:24:19,008 --> 00:24:23,330
because one of the things that Tommy said when he answered this question via email

490
00:24:23,330 --> 00:24:28,832
was that he's never really experienced burnout the way we described it in that model,

491
00:24:28,832 --> 00:24:33,654
and I wonder how much of that has to do with literal ownership of the work.

492
00:24:33,654 --> 00:24:37,175
You know, David and Amir, you're both in positions where...

493
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:39,820
The work truly is yours.

494
00:24:39,820 --> 00:24:42,401
I mean, you're both speaking about passion to this.

495
00:24:42,401 --> 00:24:45,182
And, you know, Kate, you're a consultant.

496
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:48,323
That is a very different position, where the people,

497
00:24:48,323 --> 00:24:50,884
you can say all the amazing things you want,

498
00:24:50,884 --> 00:24:52,585
but they could choose or not to listen,

499
00:24:52,585 --> 00:24:55,486
kind of like the original Jurassic Park.

500
00:24:55,486 --> 00:24:57,587
No, seriously, no, the technical consultant

501
00:24:57,587 --> 00:25:00,188
on the original Jurassic Park, Dr. Jack Horner,

502
00:25:00,188 --> 00:25:03,350
is a big proponent of the idea that the Tyrannosaurus Rex

503
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:05,410
is not a hunter, but a scavenger, largely

504
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:06,611
based on its anatomy.

505
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,152
That would have been a boring movie.

506
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:12,275
But you're in a position where they can take or leave your suggestions.

507
00:25:12,275 --> 00:25:15,577
So all three of you are in very unique positions.

508
00:25:15,577 --> 00:25:23,042
What would you say to those who don't have your positions about this?

509
00:25:23,042 --> 00:25:24,203
Easy question, right?

510
00:25:24,691 --> 00:25:29,894
Well, I think that, I mean, just my view is that that just doubles down on the stress.

511
00:25:29,894 --> 00:25:35,377
I mean, if you have some level of agency in the work that you do, like in my case, it's

512
00:25:35,377 --> 00:25:39,939
like I consult, and if they don't like what I said or they're not going to do what I say,

513
00:25:39,939 --> 00:25:41,600
I'm just like, good luck.

514
00:25:41,600 --> 00:25:43,481
You know, it's in writing that I told you so.

515
00:25:43,481 --> 00:25:46,803
So when you do screw up, not when, but when you do, because I know you will, because you

516
00:25:46,803 --> 00:25:49,964
didn't listen to me, you will get banned in this country.

517
00:25:49,964 --> 00:25:51,845
You will have this huge uprising on Twitter.

518
00:25:52,265 --> 00:25:55,227
You know, you can come back and just say, you know, we're sorry, we didn't listen to

519
00:25:55,227 --> 00:25:55,907
you.

520
00:25:55,907 --> 00:25:57,427
But it, but that's hard.

521
00:25:57,427 --> 00:25:58,708
That's very hard.

522
00:25:58,708 --> 00:26:00,389
Because I want them to succeed.

523
00:26:00,389 --> 00:26:02,769
My whole job is to help them succeed.

524
00:26:02,769 --> 00:26:05,090
And so that adds a lot of stress on me.

525
00:26:05,090 --> 00:26:06,511
I get emotional stress from it.

526
00:26:06,511 --> 00:26:07,731
I feel stressful for them.

527
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:11,513
And if that happens frequently, which it doesn't, but it can,

528
00:26:11,513 --> 00:26:15,534
you know, we have multiple things like that happen,

529
00:26:15,534 --> 00:26:16,595
that's burnout.

530
00:26:16,595 --> 00:26:18,816
You're just like, maybe I should just go take

531
00:26:18,816 --> 00:26:20,596
an easy job somewhere.

532
00:26:20,596 --> 00:26:22,817
I could just be a program manager on Marvel,

533
00:26:22,817 --> 00:26:25,618
so maybe I can meet Chris Hemsworth someday or something.

534
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:27,619
I don't know.

535
00:26:27,619 --> 00:26:31,920
So I think this is, I'm going to give an answer to basically

536
00:26:31,920 --> 00:26:33,401
two questions here.

537
00:26:34,745 --> 00:26:39,529
One of the things that I've noticed that helps me tremendously with burnout is making sure

538
00:26:39,529 --> 00:26:41,590
that I love the people who I work with.

539
00:26:41,590 --> 00:26:43,372
It makes an enormous difference.

540
00:26:43,372 --> 00:26:47,975
It doesn't matter how crappy the world is and how many things are going wrong.

541
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:52,298
If I trust and care about the people who I'm with, it's kind of like, well, we're all in

542
00:26:52,298 --> 00:26:52,719
this together.

543
00:26:52,719 --> 00:26:53,599
We'll make it work, right?

544
00:26:53,599 --> 00:26:56,221
And even if we don't make it work, we care about each other.

545
00:26:56,221 --> 00:26:57,322
We'll figure this out.

546
00:26:58,147 --> 00:27:03,191
I realize, and so that's an inserted question you were going to ask later,

547
00:27:03,191 --> 00:27:06,834
but I think that this is, I understand that I'm privileged,

548
00:27:06,834 --> 00:27:12,439
like I literally get to pick who I work with because I'm the person who runs the company.

549
00:27:12,439 --> 00:27:16,081
But I do feel like when I talk to my friends who are not in that position,

550
00:27:16,081 --> 00:27:21,505
that they oftentimes underestimate their ability to get themselves out of situations

551
00:27:21,505 --> 00:27:24,488
where they're working with people whom they aren't happy being around.

552
00:27:25,651 --> 00:27:31,373
And that's actually something that I'd really strongly encourage you guys like it like you know many people are afraid

553
00:27:31,373 --> 00:27:37,456
To even go to their manager for example and tell them like I'm not happy around this person like and there's so many reasons

554
00:27:37,456 --> 00:27:40,637
You could be not happy. It's not like it could be that they're a terrible human being sure

555
00:27:41,098 --> 00:27:42,819
And that happens.

556
00:27:42,819 --> 00:27:44,400
And it could also be other things.

557
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:47,081
It could just be subtle things, like there's a major cultural mismatch,

558
00:27:47,081 --> 00:27:48,482
like you're constantly feeling friction,

559
00:27:48,482 --> 00:27:51,224
like you're not being able to settle it yourselves, you know, whatever.

560
00:27:51,224 --> 00:27:53,005
Actually, sorry, I should take a step back.

561
00:27:53,005 --> 00:27:55,847
If it is something like that, like talk to that person, try to work it out, right?

562
00:27:55,847 --> 00:27:57,788
Like don't just be miserable.

563
00:27:57,788 --> 00:27:59,549
Like that's like a first thing.

564
00:27:59,549 --> 00:28:04,052
But like if you have tried that or feel like there's a good reason you can't,

565
00:28:04,052 --> 00:28:05,873
like for example, that person is a harasser.

566
00:28:06,210 --> 00:28:07,551
Then yeah, you go to your manager.

567
00:28:07,551 --> 00:28:09,652
Like, don't just be silently miserable.

568
00:28:09,652 --> 00:28:12,273
And if you feel like you can't go to your manager about something like that,

569
00:28:12,273 --> 00:28:14,955
like, that's a very strong signal you are in the wrong place.

570
00:28:14,955 --> 00:28:18,297
Like, you do not belong in a company where you cannot tell your manager that

571
00:28:18,297 --> 00:28:20,998
there's another person who, for whatever the reason, makes you not want to go to

572
00:28:20,998 --> 00:28:21,238
work.

573
00:28:21,238 --> 00:28:23,600
You know what I mean?

574
00:28:23,600 --> 00:28:28,402
And if you make an effort to make sure that you're only working with people who

575
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:29,423
you like and respect.

576
00:28:29,733 --> 00:28:31,834
it will make such a huge difference.

577
00:28:31,834 --> 00:28:34,535
It dampens burnout dramatically.

578
00:28:34,535 --> 00:28:37,796
And if that means that you need to just be

579
00:28:37,796 --> 00:28:40,797
more of a hustler and always be aware of like

580
00:28:40,797 --> 00:28:42,218
where your next job might be

581
00:28:42,218 --> 00:28:43,939
because the current one isn't the one

582
00:28:43,939 --> 00:28:44,859
isn't working out for all the reasons

583
00:28:44,859 --> 00:28:46,139
that I just described, then like so be it.

584
00:28:46,139 --> 00:28:46,720
You know what I mean?

585
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:48,040
Like hopefully not, like hopefully eventually

586
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:48,600
you find a place.

587
00:28:48,600 --> 00:28:50,461
Like I like to think that the people at SpriteFox

588
00:28:50,461 --> 00:28:52,082
feel pretty good about being at SpriteFox.

589
00:28:52,082 --> 00:28:53,642
We don't have a lot of turnover, you know?

590
00:28:53,642 --> 00:28:55,963
These companies exist, you can find them.

591
00:28:55,963 --> 00:28:57,604
Like you owe that to yourself.

592
00:28:57,904 --> 00:28:59,085
If you're gonna work this hard,

593
00:28:59,085 --> 00:29:01,487
let's face it, everyone in this room who's making games,

594
00:29:01,487 --> 00:29:03,968
there's a very, very high chance you could double your salary

595
00:29:03,968 --> 00:29:05,349
in any other industry.

596
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:07,451
Like, very high chance.

597
00:29:07,451 --> 00:29:10,833
So if you're gonna work in this industry really hard,

598
00:29:10,833 --> 00:29:14,976
like, making less than you could be making anywhere else,

599
00:29:14,976 --> 00:29:17,558
possibly longer hours than you'd be working anywhere else,

600
00:29:17,558 --> 00:29:20,340
like, you deserve to at least work with people that you like.

601
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,420
Thank you.

602
00:29:30,382 --> 00:29:32,263
I'm trying to let that one sink in for a moment,

603
00:29:32,263 --> 00:29:36,146
because, I mean, that touches on two of the three parts

604
00:29:36,146 --> 00:29:37,407
of the burnout model.

605
00:29:37,407 --> 00:29:40,650
You're talking about self-efficacy and attachment

606
00:29:40,650 --> 00:29:44,553
to an outcome, as well as a lack of cynicism in your work

607
00:29:44,553 --> 00:29:45,134
environment.

608
00:29:45,134 --> 00:29:46,855
So you're touching on two out of three,

609
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:48,656
and it sounds remarkably protective.

610
00:29:48,656 --> 00:29:49,857
That's awesome.

611
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:50,518
Amir, how about you?

612
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:52,620
Yeah, I mean, you know, a late night.

613
00:29:53,483 --> 00:29:56,187
So we made Bash in the living room of my dad's house.

614
00:29:56,187 --> 00:30:00,552
So like a late night there was not a burnout night.

615
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:03,977
It was like a sleepover that lasted for 20 months.

616
00:30:03,977 --> 00:30:04,157
So.

617
00:30:05,542 --> 00:30:13,168
It was a different feeling because I was there with the woman who would become my wife and

618
00:30:13,168 --> 00:30:16,731
my best friends in the whole world working on a game together.

619
00:30:16,731 --> 00:30:25,279
So that feels really different than if you're in a big team or a big company where I think

620
00:30:25,279 --> 00:30:28,341
one of the things that's really interesting to me about Crunch stuff is

621
00:30:28,742 --> 00:30:33,784
I think it's pretty rare that someone directly just says,

622
00:30:33,784 --> 00:30:34,644
you know, push, push it.

623
00:30:34,644 --> 00:30:36,084
Like, do more than you can do.

624
00:30:36,084 --> 00:30:38,746
That's almost never the conversation, right?

625
00:30:38,746 --> 00:30:40,886
It's usually a little bit more insidious,

626
00:30:40,886 --> 00:30:43,988
which is you have way more work than time.

627
00:30:43,988 --> 00:30:45,408
People are starting to stay late.

628
00:30:45,408 --> 00:30:46,769
They're starting to bring in dinners.

629
00:30:46,769 --> 00:30:49,010
These like small telltale signs,

630
00:30:49,010 --> 00:30:50,950
leadership is getting anxious and nervous.

631
00:30:51,010 --> 00:30:52,991
Well, and that's what we heard from everybody here.

632
00:30:52,991 --> 00:30:55,632
Yeah, release date is coming up, these kinds of things.

633
00:30:55,632 --> 00:30:58,213
It's all, and if you are in a situation

634
00:30:58,213 --> 00:31:00,234
even where you love the people you work with,

635
00:31:00,234 --> 00:31:03,495
you may feel like a lot of social pressure to deliver

636
00:31:03,495 --> 00:31:06,156
because you don't want to let anyone down, right?

637
00:31:06,156 --> 00:31:09,117
In those scenarios, it can be helpful

638
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,658
to think of the difference between

639
00:31:10,658 --> 00:31:12,999
when you own the work and when you don't.

640
00:31:12,999 --> 00:31:15,060
Because if someone is asking or implying

641
00:31:15,060 --> 00:31:16,540
that you should do this,

642
00:31:16,842 --> 00:31:22,366
If you're doing it for probably what we could categorize are healthy reasons, like you want

643
00:31:22,366 --> 00:31:27,289
to be a part of something, you really believe in what's there, you think it's time limited

644
00:31:27,289 --> 00:31:32,493
and it's not going to destroy your life, those are maybe some reasons that you can use to

645
00:31:32,493 --> 00:31:37,256
convince yourself to put in a little more or whatever you want, but for the most part.

646
00:31:38,024 --> 00:31:41,867
the people who are creating these environments

647
00:31:41,867 --> 00:31:46,890
are like maybe the only ones who stand to benefit from this.

648
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:50,693
So a lot of people work really hard on things

649
00:31:50,693 --> 00:31:55,776
that they later do not see the economic or positive

650
00:31:55,776 --> 00:31:58,999
or brand or reputational benefits from that.

651
00:31:58,999 --> 00:32:00,340
And that's really, really different.

652
00:32:00,340 --> 00:32:01,400
So think about.

653
00:32:02,317 --> 00:32:05,818
Think about who is going to benefit from your overwork.

654
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:12,400
Because it's a really different equation if it's you and your peers and the people you're connected

655
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:16,441
to and fans that you might love or a franchise that you might be really,

656
00:32:16,441 --> 00:32:24,864
really attached to than like shareholders or like the executive staff of your corporation

657
00:32:24,864 --> 00:32:28,005
who may not even know your name.

658
00:32:28,005 --> 00:32:32,167
So it's a really, really, really different sort of setup between those two things.

659
00:32:32,627 --> 00:32:34,148
Well, what do you all see?

660
00:32:34,148 --> 00:32:36,228
You mentioned, David, you mentioned your privilege

661
00:32:36,228 --> 00:32:37,169
in being able to pick your team,

662
00:32:37,169 --> 00:32:39,409
and Kate had stories of, you know,

663
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:41,470
way back in the day at Microsoft

664
00:32:41,470 --> 00:32:43,630
and the bureaucratic structure that it is.

665
00:32:43,630 --> 00:32:46,491
Where do you all see managers,

666
00:32:46,491 --> 00:32:49,392
especially like mid-level managers,

667
00:32:49,392 --> 00:32:53,993
where is their responsibility in helping to curb the burnout?

668
00:32:55,362 --> 00:32:56,703
Well, from my perspective, a manager is a leader,

669
00:32:56,703 --> 00:32:59,145
but what to lead is to serve, in my view.

670
00:32:59,145 --> 00:33:02,128
And if you are in a leadership position,

671
00:33:02,128 --> 00:33:06,251
that means you are serving the needs of the people under you.

672
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:08,453
And if you don't see it that way,

673
00:33:08,453 --> 00:33:09,934
then you should not be a leader.

674
00:33:09,934 --> 00:33:11,875
You should not be a manager.

675
00:33:11,875 --> 00:33:15,358
Basically, it's not a triangle with you at the top,

676
00:33:15,358 --> 00:33:16,199
it's you at the bottom.

677
00:33:16,779 --> 00:33:18,800
serving the needs of everyone in your organization.

678
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,960
So you work for them.

679
00:33:20,960 --> 00:33:23,381
And that's really the perspective that you have to see it.

680
00:33:23,381 --> 00:33:26,182
So on that level, you have a fundamental responsibility

681
00:33:26,182 --> 00:33:28,703
not only to the job that they're working on

682
00:33:28,703 --> 00:33:29,823
so that it's successful,

683
00:33:29,823 --> 00:33:31,984
so you're obviously trying to work towards the production

684
00:33:31,984 --> 00:33:32,964
and all that kind of stuff,

685
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:35,445
but that also means shepherding their needs.

686
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:38,708
and making sure that they're okay on an emotional level,

687
00:33:38,708 --> 00:33:41,490
physical level, all these other dimensions

688
00:33:41,490 --> 00:33:44,273
of what makes a successful project happen.

689
00:33:44,273 --> 00:33:49,077
And to look just at numbers and just look at a timesheet

690
00:33:49,077 --> 00:33:51,419
of what's due, the due dates and all that kind of stuff,

691
00:33:51,419 --> 00:33:52,180
yeah, you gotta do that

692
00:33:52,180 --> 00:33:53,901
because that's part of your responsibility.

693
00:33:53,901 --> 00:33:56,324
But to me, that's the easy part.

694
00:33:56,324 --> 00:33:58,906
The hard part is actually going around

695
00:33:58,906 --> 00:34:01,548
and making sure you know the names of everyone on your team.

696
00:34:01,748 --> 00:34:04,011
and making sure you know what their situation is,

697
00:34:04,011 --> 00:34:06,273
and making sure you have some level of empathy

698
00:34:06,273 --> 00:34:08,675
with the different situations that they're facing

699
00:34:08,675 --> 00:34:10,898
because every single person's different.

700
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:14,701
And so that's one of the things I often really try

701
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:16,683
and encourage people in a leadership role.

702
00:34:16,683 --> 00:34:20,327
It's like if you cannot see yourself as a servant

703
00:34:20,327 --> 00:34:22,730
and as a shepherd, then you're definitely in the wrong job.

704
00:34:33,727 --> 00:34:35,968
All right, apparently Kay just dropped the mic on that one.

705
00:34:35,968 --> 00:34:41,750
Just don't drop the mic, they're expensive, okay.

706
00:34:41,750 --> 00:34:43,311
You all talked about mistakes.

707
00:34:43,311 --> 00:34:47,453
That mistakes are inevitable.

708
00:34:47,453 --> 00:34:50,814
And in fact, Amir, you talked about your learning process

709
00:34:50,814 --> 00:34:53,435
as a constant recalibration of mistakes

710
00:34:53,435 --> 00:34:56,037
in a new environment.

711
00:34:57,995 --> 00:35:06,482
What advice do you have for everybody on how to accept the fact that we will make mistakes?

712
00:35:06,482 --> 00:35:11,187
And how do they build the resilience to get through them?

713
00:35:11,187 --> 00:35:13,148
Yeah, so they're not mistakes.

714
00:35:13,148 --> 00:35:15,150
That's the simple answer.

715
00:35:15,150 --> 00:35:17,332
How could you have known?

716
00:35:17,332 --> 00:35:21,956
There is no way for you to have known how it was going to affect your life and what

717
00:35:21,956 --> 00:35:24,258
was going to happen to it until you did it.

718
00:35:24,870 --> 00:35:30,834
So I would not necessarily view those chapters of your life

719
00:35:30,834 --> 00:35:34,036
as a moment where you totally drop the ball on something

720
00:35:34,036 --> 00:35:36,117
that everyone already knew.

721
00:35:36,117 --> 00:35:38,219
Because everyone's limits are different.

722
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,800
Everyone's lives are different.

723
00:35:39,800 --> 00:35:44,002
All those things are unique and personal to the individuals.

724
00:35:44,002 --> 00:35:48,845
So if you've experienced some extreme emotional event

725
00:35:48,845 --> 00:35:51,587
connected to work, or even like a persistent low level,

726
00:35:52,808 --> 00:36:00,724
nagging emotional event sort of connected to those things, I would be kind to yourself

727
00:36:00,724 --> 00:36:02,487
about that.

728
00:36:03,029 --> 00:36:07,113
The reason I have to keep relearning is because it's popping up in different ways.

729
00:36:07,113 --> 00:36:12,519
You know, if it was the exact same thing every time, I would be much more prepared.

730
00:36:12,519 --> 00:36:20,767
But the way this kind of consumption creeps into your life is going to be different each

731
00:36:20,767 --> 00:36:23,931
time and it's probably because it's coming from some place inside you.

732
00:36:25,012 --> 00:36:29,335
that's either highly motivated or highly ambitious or highly loyal to the people you work with

733
00:36:29,335 --> 00:36:32,998
or whatever those things are, it's probably coming from a place that isn't entirely negative,

734
00:36:32,998 --> 00:36:37,522
that isn't just a lack of self-control, an inability to constrain yourself, a lack of

735
00:36:37,522 --> 00:36:41,945
prioritization, like all the things that we can use to beat ourselves up with.

736
00:36:41,945 --> 00:36:45,968
Yeah, I just, yeah, it's not a mistake. It's just how you have to learn.

737
00:36:45,968 --> 00:36:47,650
So you're talking about reframing.

738
00:36:47,650 --> 00:36:47,790
Yeah.

739
00:36:47,790 --> 00:36:49,311
But it's, I mean, it's central to.

740
00:36:50,212 --> 00:36:53,893
It is not a coincidence that many of the most successful creative companies,

741
00:36:53,893 --> 00:36:58,154
including like the Pixar's and stuff of the world, like they are all very,

742
00:36:58,154 --> 00:37:02,935
very good at trying to banish the word failure from their company cultures.

743
00:37:02,935 --> 00:37:04,175
Like it's not failure.

744
00:37:04,175 --> 00:37:05,336
It's just not failure.

745
00:37:05,336 --> 00:37:08,156
It's, I mean, there are forms of failure, but

746
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:09,917
they're not the ones that most people think about.

747
00:37:09,917 --> 00:37:11,377
Like if you hire someone.

748
00:37:11,841 --> 00:37:16,754
and they are just unreliable and mean and whatever,

749
00:37:16,754 --> 00:37:19,240
like, you know, bad person attributes for like,

750
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:20,543
I don't know what you would call that.

751
00:37:20,926 --> 00:37:24,668
Like, yeah, those people are failing, as far as I'm concerned.

752
00:37:24,668 --> 00:37:27,230
And we do everything we can to try to get rid of...

753
00:37:27,230 --> 00:37:29,611
Unfortunately, we've actually... I don't think in the history of SpriteFox

754
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,532
we've ever hired someone that was quite that bad.

755
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:34,194
But like, when we hire someone who's even a little bit toxic,

756
00:37:34,194 --> 00:37:37,576
like we make an effort to get rid of them quickly.

757
00:37:37,576 --> 00:37:39,057
Because that's failure. That's bad.

758
00:37:39,057 --> 00:37:44,100
Aside from that, like if it's a person who's like an intelligent human being

759
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:46,842
who really cares and is honestly trying their best,

760
00:37:46,842 --> 00:37:48,863
and something goes wrong, it's never failure.

761
00:37:49,253 --> 00:37:51,214
it's just they tried their best and it didn't work.

762
00:37:51,214 --> 00:37:53,036
And we're super, super hardcore about that.

763
00:37:53,036 --> 00:37:54,357
And we've started to entrench that

764
00:37:54,357 --> 00:37:56,038
in other aspects of our culture.

765
00:37:56,038 --> 00:37:58,600
Like for example, a little bit of quick background

766
00:37:58,600 --> 00:37:59,661
that will help you understand.

767
00:37:59,661 --> 00:38:00,622
Spry Fox is kind of weird.

768
00:38:00,622 --> 00:38:03,624
Like we're only 18 people, but we'll have like four games

769
00:38:03,624 --> 00:38:05,746
in concurrent development at any given time.

770
00:38:05,746 --> 00:38:07,527
And we've been like that since the beginning

771
00:38:07,527 --> 00:38:10,670
when we were even a lot less than 18 people.

772
00:38:10,670 --> 00:38:12,491
And we do that in part because

773
00:38:12,962 --> 00:38:15,706
we have this obsession with making highly creative games

774
00:38:15,706 --> 00:38:16,927
and we know that we're probably,

775
00:38:16,927 --> 00:38:19,010
like that's super risky and some of them are gonna fail.

776
00:38:19,010 --> 00:38:21,212
Maybe even a lot of them are gonna fail.

777
00:38:21,503 --> 00:38:23,845
And so as a result, you have to be making a lot of them,

778
00:38:23,845 --> 00:38:26,587
so that at least one of them can succeed and cover

779
00:38:26,587 --> 00:38:28,448
the cost of all the failures.

780
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,570
But when you do that, like I was saying earlier,

781
00:38:30,570 --> 00:38:33,592
like you're pouring yourself into these original expressions

782
00:38:33,592 --> 00:38:36,354
and then they fail, and it's a knife in the heart.

783
00:38:36,354 --> 00:38:38,276
And so how do you deal with that?

784
00:38:38,276 --> 00:38:41,618
And the way you deal with it is by not calling it failure,

785
00:38:41,618 --> 00:38:44,080
like you celebrate all the things you learned

786
00:38:44,080 --> 00:38:45,481
from making that thing.

787
00:38:45,481 --> 00:38:48,163
And like we try to be really conscious about that.

788
00:38:48,763 --> 00:38:50,944
where a game, at the end of it,

789
00:38:50,944 --> 00:38:53,185
we'll spend a lot of time talking about

790
00:38:53,185 --> 00:38:54,986
what are all the cool things that we did

791
00:38:54,986 --> 00:38:56,287
and what did we learn from that?

792
00:38:56,287 --> 00:38:58,247
And oh, were there any problems?

793
00:38:58,247 --> 00:38:59,808
What did we learn from that?

794
00:38:59,808 --> 00:39:01,369
And it's never failure, you know what I mean?

795
00:39:01,369 --> 00:39:02,929
It's just growing as a person.

796
00:39:02,929 --> 00:39:04,550
I think that's super central.

797
00:39:04,550 --> 00:39:06,191
We also recently in our Slack channel.

798
00:39:07,043 --> 00:39:13,985
added a pyre channel for a place where like if you're working on a prototype and the prototype

799
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:18,906
ends up not being fun, you like give it its end off there, right? Like, like, you know,

800
00:39:18,906 --> 00:39:24,027
it was a good soldier, it died, hooray, on to the next one. And like, and it's just a

801
00:39:24,027 --> 00:39:28,949
way of, like again, so that it's not, you didn't screw up. Like the fact that your prototype

802
00:39:28,949 --> 00:39:34,310
wasn't fun is not a, is not on you. Like, that's what happens with prototypes. Let's

803
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,830
celebrate the fact that this one...

804
00:39:36,570 --> 00:39:38,071
didn't work out and move on to the next one.

805
00:39:38,071 --> 00:39:39,412
You know what I mean?

806
00:39:39,412 --> 00:39:41,894
So I think that's actually pretty important.

807
00:39:41,894 --> 00:39:44,576
I highly encourage you to try to completely reframe

808
00:39:44,576 --> 00:39:47,037
your thinking that, and also again, quite frankly,

809
00:39:47,037 --> 00:39:49,459
if you're in a place where that's not the way people think

810
00:39:49,459 --> 00:39:51,000
and they're not willing to think that way,

811
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,521
no matter how much you encourage them to,

812
00:39:52,521 --> 00:39:54,422
like maybe that's not a good place to be.

813
00:39:54,422 --> 00:39:57,424
Like don't be at a place where you get browbeaten

814
00:39:57,424 --> 00:40:00,546
for trying your best and it not working out.

815
00:40:00,546 --> 00:40:02,227
Yeah.

816
00:40:04,098 --> 00:40:07,959
So all of you have touched on this idea of studio culture

817
00:40:07,959 --> 00:40:08,619
being important.

818
00:40:08,619 --> 00:40:15,622
Like, what's your take home tip for people looking for a

819
00:40:15,622 --> 00:40:17,322
good fit for studio culture?

820
00:40:17,322 --> 00:40:19,543
Like, what do you look for?

821
00:40:19,543 --> 00:40:20,423
Go for it.

822
00:40:20,423 --> 00:40:26,885
It's always good when I ask a question like, ooh.

823
00:40:26,885 --> 00:40:30,587
Yeah, well, so I mean, I can just talk about.

824
00:40:30,848 --> 00:40:33,370
I'm gonna just answer a different question because yeah.

825
00:40:33,370 --> 00:40:35,111
Well that's, you know what, that's okay.

826
00:40:35,111 --> 00:40:36,512
Take the politician's way out.

827
00:40:36,512 --> 00:40:39,855
Yeah, so yeah, I'll just answer the question

828
00:40:39,855 --> 00:40:41,616
I wanna answer, which is like,

829
00:40:41,616 --> 00:40:43,798
what do we do around things like this?

830
00:40:43,798 --> 00:40:46,700
Like, what do we do to promote healthy working habits?

831
00:40:46,700 --> 00:40:49,142
Because, so ultimately, it's Supergiant.

832
00:40:49,142 --> 00:40:51,664
Here's the thing I'm most proud of at Supergiant.

833
00:40:51,664 --> 00:40:52,945
We made really good games.

834
00:40:52,945 --> 00:40:55,547
All the people who worked on Bastion still work there,

835
00:40:55,547 --> 00:40:58,249
right, those are, that group is still there.

836
00:40:58,249 --> 00:40:58,369
So.

837
00:40:59,853 --> 00:41:07,860
For us, like, uh, sustainably creating, like, the games we make is, like, central to what we want to

838
00:41:07,860 --> 00:41:12,223
accomplish. So, you know, hopefully we'll be like the Rolling Stones and be like super

839
00:41:12,223 --> 00:41:18,489
fricking old, charge like $10,000 per game or something when we're like 70. Um, but, um, the

840
00:41:18,489 --> 00:41:22,172
basic idea for us is we end up...

841
00:41:22,853 --> 00:41:27,095
uh, doing things we like hesitated about because we came from EA, so it's like we shouldn't

842
00:41:27,095 --> 00:41:31,216
have policies, but actually we need policies. Um, and we especially need policies, uh, to

843
00:41:31,216 --> 00:41:36,797
save us, like, from ourselves. Um, so an example of stuff we do at Supergiant. Uh, we don't

844
00:41:36,797 --> 00:41:41,458
send weekend emails. So like Friday at 5 to Monday at 5 AM, there's no emails or slack

845
00:41:41,458 --> 00:41:45,719
messages or anything like that. If there's an emergency, you get a phone call and there are

846
00:41:45,719 --> 00:41:50,160
emergencies. Um, and so you don't have to worry about checking, you know you can turn it

847
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:50,740
off, that's it. Uh, we...

848
00:41:53,856 --> 00:41:59,102
used to have unlimited time off and then no one took time off. Um, so we have a mandatory

849
00:41:59,102 --> 00:42:04,269
minimum 20 days off and you can take more. Um, so the idea is we have the kind of culture

850
00:42:04,269 --> 00:42:10,036
where people need to be reminded to leave. Um, and so we made a policy around that. Um,

851
00:42:10,837 --> 00:42:15,160
And then we have like really liberal kind of like work from home type of policies

852
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:18,543
because we want like work life balance is something that comes up a lot.

853
00:42:18,543 --> 00:42:23,207
I, for some reason I chafe at that phrase cause it makes it sound like there is a

854
00:42:23,207 --> 00:42:28,212
perfect state that you can achieve in which your work and life are like

855
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:29,853
perfectly just in it like together.

856
00:42:29,853 --> 00:42:32,655
Um, for me, we, we try to talk about like work life integration.

857
00:42:33,796 --> 00:42:36,918
How does work contour to your life?

858
00:42:36,918 --> 00:42:38,919
Like how can it fit into your life?

859
00:42:38,919 --> 00:42:41,961
And in any reasonable human company

860
00:42:41,961 --> 00:42:43,241
that's trying to sustain itself,

861
00:42:43,241 --> 00:42:46,663
that will change like almost every year.

862
00:42:46,663 --> 00:42:50,145
So in terms of a culture, you know,

863
00:42:50,145 --> 00:42:52,126
work contours to your life is a central part of our culture.

864
00:42:52,986 --> 00:42:59,287
And we end up inventing all these small ways to promote healthy habits for ourselves as a result.

865
00:42:59,287 --> 00:43:05,149
And the only reason we could make those is because we did the opposite and it didn't work.

866
00:43:05,149 --> 00:43:07,449
So we had to learn it over time.

867
00:43:07,449 --> 00:43:12,930
So we've done some similar stuff where, for example, we say you should not work weekends.

868
00:43:12,930 --> 00:43:15,891
And sometimes, like you said, there's emergencies.

869
00:43:16,227 --> 00:43:20,195
people will have to work weekends, but we explicitly say,

870
00:43:20,195 --> 00:43:22,880
and by we I mean Daniel and I, the co-founders,

871
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:24,964
that if someone is working on a weekend,

872
00:43:24,964 --> 00:43:27,008
there is a very high chance that that means

873
00:43:27,008 --> 00:43:28,050
Daniel and I fucked up.

874
00:43:28,694 --> 00:43:30,315
Like, we take that on ourselves.

875
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:34,920
And like, and we encourage everyone who works in SpriteFox to feel free to call us out on that too.

876
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:39,305
Like, if someone's like, I worked eight hours on Saturday, you suck Dave.

877
00:43:39,305 --> 00:43:41,607
Like, like, like that's a good thing, right?

878
00:43:41,607 --> 00:43:48,454
Because it increases the odds that I'm, I mean, it decreases the likelihood that I will then put them in that situation again in the future.

879
00:43:48,454 --> 00:43:50,656
Because I don't like being told I suck.

880
00:43:50,656 --> 00:43:50,697
So...

881
00:43:51,069 --> 00:43:52,370
So there's that.

882
00:43:52,370 --> 00:43:55,312
And we also have a challenge that Supergiant doesn't,

883
00:43:55,312 --> 00:43:57,333
which is that we're spread all over the world.

884
00:43:57,333 --> 00:44:00,916
So this has made it super hard to have boundaries

885
00:44:00,916 --> 00:44:03,238
around work and life, because it's like.

886
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:05,335
I have people who are in South Africa.

887
00:44:05,335 --> 00:44:08,277
They're messaging me at hours that I would rather not be

888
00:44:08,277 --> 00:44:09,758
messaged.

889
00:44:09,758 --> 00:44:13,761
But I don't want them to have to work crazy hours, so I will

890
00:44:13,761 --> 00:44:14,622
accept those messages.

891
00:44:14,622 --> 00:44:16,763
And it's a thing, and it's complicated.

892
00:44:16,763 --> 00:44:18,184
And honestly, there's no good answer to that.

893
00:44:18,184 --> 00:44:18,925
It's very messy.

894
00:44:18,925 --> 00:44:21,807
So what we've tried to do to solve for that, aside from

895
00:44:21,807 --> 00:44:23,568
like, please don't work on weekends, so at least I'm not

896
00:44:23,568 --> 00:44:28,251
getting the insane 2 AM message on Saturday, is

897
00:44:30,075 --> 00:44:33,940
please be respectful and ask folks how they feel about being

898
00:44:33,940 --> 00:44:35,782
messaged at any given time.

899
00:44:35,782 --> 00:44:37,684
We have people on the team who.

900
00:44:38,116 --> 00:44:43,959
feel very, very, very strongly that they should not be bothered in Slack on a Saturday or Sunday

901
00:44:43,959 --> 00:44:49,642
for any reason. And so I know who those people are. And like, we now have a culture in the studio

902
00:44:49,642 --> 00:44:55,325
where like, if I'm like trying to like use their name, but I don't want to bother them, I'll like

903
00:44:55,325 --> 00:45:00,508
Brent, like we'll write we'll do B dash rent in Slack so that he does not get a ping.

904
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:02,532
You know, and everyone in the studio knows this,

905
00:45:02,532 --> 00:45:03,693
and you'll see, like, on the weekends,

906
00:45:03,693 --> 00:45:04,894
when people are, like, the few people

907
00:45:04,894 --> 00:45:06,675
who are bothering to write something on the weekends,

908
00:45:06,675 --> 00:45:08,016
like, they're all dashing names.

909
00:45:08,016 --> 00:45:10,837
And it's great, because it's like a conscious

910
00:45:10,837 --> 00:45:11,978
and very clear cultural sign

911
00:45:11,978 --> 00:45:13,719
that, like, we respect people's boundaries.

912
00:45:13,719 --> 00:45:16,081
That's probably one of my favorite things

913
00:45:16,081 --> 00:45:17,982
that has happened organically in our Slack channel.

914
00:45:17,982 --> 00:45:20,083
So it's just a thing, like,

915
00:45:20,083 --> 00:45:21,484
you just have the open conversations about it.

916
00:45:21,484 --> 00:45:23,425
There are people in the group that like,

917
00:45:23,425 --> 00:45:25,966
they actually, like, for them it's actually more important

918
00:45:25,966 --> 00:45:28,268
to be able to take, like, Friday off.

919
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:31,105
Like, they actually want to spend a few hours on Saturday

920
00:45:31,105 --> 00:45:32,425
and like, take all of Friday off.

921
00:45:32,425 --> 00:45:33,785
And it's like, okay, you can do that,

922
00:45:33,785 --> 00:45:35,445
but like, you're gonna do the hyphen thing

923
00:45:35,445 --> 00:45:36,606
on the weekend when you are working.

924
00:45:36,606 --> 00:45:38,206
Like, you're not bothering the rest of us.

925
00:45:38,206 --> 00:45:41,026
Don't, like, don't ruin our lives with your choices.

926
00:45:41,026 --> 00:45:43,887
And like, and it works, for the most part.

927
00:45:43,887 --> 00:45:44,647
Like, it's messy.

928
00:45:44,647 --> 00:45:46,507
Again, I'm not gonna pretend that this is like, perfect.

929
00:45:46,507 --> 00:45:48,068
There are definitely times where like,

930
00:45:48,068 --> 00:45:50,548
there's some friction, but it works okay.

931
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:53,389
Well, I know from the other side of the coin,

932
00:45:53,389 --> 00:45:55,909
how many people here are freelance by choice?

933
00:45:57,342 --> 00:45:58,682
OK, so there's some of us here.

934
00:45:58,682 --> 00:46:00,583
Yeah, not a lot of us, but there's some of us.

935
00:46:00,583 --> 00:46:03,744
So for those of us who are freelance or consultants

936
00:46:03,744 --> 00:46:07,024
or in that role that we're not working in a company,

937
00:46:07,024 --> 00:46:09,245
but we choose to work with different companies,

938
00:46:09,245 --> 00:46:13,726
oftentimes we choose because we need to pay a rent or a mortgage

939
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:14,706
or whatever.

940
00:46:14,706 --> 00:46:17,947
So a lot of times it's hard for us to turn down work,

941
00:46:17,947 --> 00:46:19,887
because we want the work, obviously.

942
00:46:19,887 --> 00:46:22,848
But there are times over my career where I have turned down.

943
00:46:23,388 --> 00:46:24,769
jobs from certain clients because

944
00:46:24,769 --> 00:46:29,896
either the project that is being brought to me is something that I don't want to

945
00:46:29,896 --> 00:46:34,922
work on, it's just the content is something I don't want to associate with,

946
00:46:34,922 --> 00:46:38,786
or the company just has a really bad reputation for how it treats its people.

947
00:46:39,147 --> 00:46:41,287
And those are really hard decisions to make

948
00:46:41,287 --> 00:46:42,547
because you're just like,

949
00:46:42,547 --> 00:46:44,328
I really could use this contract,

950
00:46:44,328 --> 00:46:47,448
but it's trying to take the high road

951
00:46:47,448 --> 00:46:50,209
and kind of reinforce these are my values.

952
00:46:50,209 --> 00:46:53,389
And the thing is, I do communicate that to them.

953
00:46:53,389 --> 00:46:54,890
Now, maybe that burns a bridge with them,

954
00:46:54,890 --> 00:46:56,270
but if that's the way they are,

955
00:46:56,270 --> 00:46:57,630
I really don't give a shit.

956
00:46:57,630 --> 00:47:01,211
So, maybe I don't want to work with them again.

957
00:47:01,211 --> 00:47:01,391
So...

958
00:47:01,391 --> 00:47:02,191
Um...

959
00:47:02,191 --> 00:47:04,171
But...

960
00:47:05,183 --> 00:47:08,004
I do think it's important to not only make that decision,

961
00:47:08,004 --> 00:47:09,824
but to communicate why.

962
00:47:09,824 --> 00:47:12,005
Why am I choosing not to take this work

963
00:47:12,005 --> 00:47:13,005
that I desperately need?

964
00:47:13,005 --> 00:47:15,726
Because you are doing this, and I know this, and this,

965
00:47:15,726 --> 00:47:18,246
and this, and you can make all the excuses,

966
00:47:18,246 --> 00:47:19,927
but I've talked to your employees or whoever,

967
00:47:19,927 --> 00:47:23,207
and it's pretty clear that you've got a messy situation.

968
00:47:23,207 --> 00:47:25,188
And so I don't want to reinforce that,

969
00:47:25,188 --> 00:47:27,749
basically help make you successful on the back of people

970
00:47:27,749 --> 00:47:31,009
who are being treated really unfairly.

971
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:35,531
But that's hard, I mean it's really hard in the consultant role or

972
00:47:35,531 --> 00:47:37,752
the freelance role to turn away stuff like that.

973
00:47:37,752 --> 00:47:39,113
But we have to be very conscious of it.

974
00:47:39,113 --> 00:47:43,215
And the other part of that, oftentimes pretty much every freelancer I know,

975
00:47:43,215 --> 00:47:46,776
we don't have someone in management giving us holidays.

976
00:47:46,776 --> 00:47:49,457
We don't have anyone telling us to go home at night.

977
00:47:49,457 --> 00:47:50,558
We don't have any of that,

978
00:47:50,558 --> 00:47:54,199
because we're basically in our home office just heads down doing this.

979
00:47:54,199 --> 00:47:58,001
And oftentimes we're doing it, of course, because we absolutely love what we do.

980
00:47:58,001 --> 00:48:00,242
Hopefully we do, if we don't then we shouldn't be doing it.

981
00:48:00,762 --> 00:48:02,903
But that's really hard.

982
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:06,403
And so I know for me, it's been really tough

983
00:48:06,403 --> 00:48:08,764
over the last 14 years after I left Microsoft

984
00:48:08,764 --> 00:48:11,724
to really discipline myself to stop working.

985
00:48:11,724 --> 00:48:14,405
You know, actually, like a policy when I'm home,

986
00:48:14,405 --> 00:48:15,845
I travel a lot to speak at events,

987
00:48:15,845 --> 00:48:17,505
but when I am home in Seattle,

988
00:48:17,505 --> 00:48:20,206
I, like Saturday is usually just my day.

989
00:48:20,206 --> 00:48:22,346
I just, I don't do anything other than just go out,

990
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:26,107
you know, you know, get some air, you know, do whatever,

991
00:48:26,107 --> 00:48:27,927
maybe, you know, clean the house a little bit.

992
00:48:28,507 --> 00:48:29,608
just don't do work.

993
00:48:29,608 --> 00:48:32,349
And so I try and do that kind of thing for myself.

994
00:48:32,349 --> 00:48:34,671
But even that's been really hard to discipline.

995
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:39,433
So I think when you're in that role, it's tough.

996
00:48:39,433 --> 00:48:41,395
And you really have to find that self-discipline.

997
00:48:41,395 --> 00:48:43,656
And if you have to, get other people around you to hold you

998
00:48:43,656 --> 00:48:45,137
accountable to it.

999
00:48:45,137 --> 00:48:47,058
I do want to quickly, something occurred to me

1000
00:48:47,058 --> 00:48:48,579
belatedly that I do want to emphasize.

1001
00:48:48,579 --> 00:48:50,220
Everything that, in particular, that Amir and I

1002
00:48:50,220 --> 00:48:52,681
were talking about, everything that Amir and I were talking

1003
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:56,803
about in particular is predicated on what I was

1004
00:48:56,803 --> 00:48:58,044
saying earlier, which is.

1005
00:48:59,159 --> 00:49:02,201
We like and trust the people we work with and vice versa.

1006
00:49:02,201 --> 00:49:04,882
Like, so much of what we've been talking about

1007
00:49:04,882 --> 00:49:08,063
would break down if we worked with assholes.

1008
00:49:08,063 --> 00:49:11,545
So I think that's something you,

1009
00:49:11,545 --> 00:49:13,126
I'm gonna repeat it because I think it's so important.

1010
00:49:13,126 --> 00:49:15,107
This is really something you have to take to heart.

1011
00:49:15,107 --> 00:49:18,308
Like you, you know, there's this mythos,

1012
00:49:18,308 --> 00:49:20,789
this mythology in Silicon Valley and in games of like,

1013
00:49:20,789 --> 00:49:21,990
well, there's that.

1014
00:49:22,596 --> 00:49:25,078
amazing programmer who's like ten times more

1015
00:49:25,078 --> 00:49:27,860
effective than any other programmer, but he's also an asshole, but it's okay

1016
00:49:27,860 --> 00:49:30,322
because he's ten times better than any other programmer, he's gonna make our game

1017
00:49:30,322 --> 00:49:31,563
amazing, and so like

1018
00:49:31,563 --> 00:49:33,444
you, yes, you want people like that.

1019
00:49:33,444 --> 00:49:37,307
I think that's bullshit. You don't want people like that. And that seems pretty consistent across the board, like

1020
00:49:37,307 --> 00:49:41,370
almost everybody I've ever spoken with has said universally, I will,

1021
00:49:41,370 --> 00:49:44,072
I would prefer

1022
00:49:44,072 --> 00:49:46,034
a middle-of-the-road employee

1023
00:49:46,034 --> 00:49:48,015
who's a delight to work with.

1024
00:49:48,275 --> 00:49:52,438
versus some diva who comes in and says,

1025
00:49:52,438 --> 00:49:55,720
yeah, I want my desk to be filled with

1026
00:49:55,720 --> 00:49:58,322
1,000 brown M&Ms every day as I go in.

1027
00:49:58,322 --> 00:50:03,306
And if there's one blue, I quit.

1028
00:50:03,306 --> 00:50:04,706
Yeah, I mean, think about it.

1029
00:50:04,706 --> 00:50:08,789
You can't have a policy where people are required

1030
00:50:08,789 --> 00:50:10,570
to take at least 20 days of vacation

1031
00:50:10,570 --> 00:50:13,032
unless you trust those people, right?

1032
00:50:13,032 --> 00:50:14,433
That they're not gonna abuse that,

1033
00:50:14,433 --> 00:50:15,994
that they're people worthy of that.

1034
00:50:15,994 --> 00:50:17,615
You can't have a situation where.

1035
00:50:18,480 --> 00:50:23,267
you know, where you expect everyone to do the hyphen thing in Slack and not bother each

1036
00:50:23,267 --> 00:50:27,694
other unless, like, they're people who actually care and would internalize something like

1037
00:50:27,694 --> 00:50:27,914
that.

1038
00:50:27,914 --> 00:50:30,218
Like, that just stops working otherwise.

1039
00:50:30,218 --> 00:50:31,940
Like, so, yeah.

1040
00:50:31,940 --> 00:50:33,182
Choose who you work with carefully.

1041
00:50:34,454 --> 00:50:37,596
And so that seems to be an ongoing theme here,

1042
00:50:37,596 --> 00:50:39,817
is that the team makes a difference,

1043
00:50:39,817 --> 00:50:41,938
and the team helps build the connection.

1044
00:50:41,938 --> 00:50:44,559
But on top of that, in terms of studio managers,

1045
00:50:44,559 --> 00:50:48,161
you, because of the amount of discipline it takes

1046
00:50:48,161 --> 00:50:51,163
to take time off when you're really passionate about this,

1047
00:50:51,163 --> 00:50:53,344
and it is, it does take a lot of discipline,

1048
00:50:53,344 --> 00:50:54,924
and it's really helpful to have people

1049
00:50:54,924 --> 00:50:57,466
who bug you to take time off.

1050
00:50:57,466 --> 00:50:59,787
I don't know this from personal experience at all.

1051
00:50:59,787 --> 00:51:01,848
I've literally been ordered to take a vacation

1052
00:51:01,848 --> 00:51:02,548
two weeks from now.

1053
00:51:03,456 --> 00:51:03,680
Um...

1054
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:07,696
My boss is laughing at this because she's the one who made me do it.

1055
00:51:07,696 --> 00:51:12,679
But, um, but, um, you're talking about implementing studio policies

1056
00:51:12,679 --> 00:51:16,321
to make people realize that working less to a degree

1057
00:51:16,321 --> 00:51:19,122
makes them work more effectively and keeps your employees.

1058
00:51:19,122 --> 00:51:23,585
And one of the signals, Amir, you look for in things is turnover rate

1059
00:51:23,585 --> 00:51:25,126
in terms of a good studio environment.

1060
00:51:25,126 --> 00:51:30,228
So, lightning round, because I want to cut to questions for a few minutes.

1061
00:51:30,228 --> 00:51:31,729
Um, think about your questions now.

1062
00:51:31,729 --> 00:51:33,510
Begin them with a who, what, where, why.

1063
00:51:34,758 --> 00:51:35,419
Not story time.

1064
00:51:35,419 --> 00:51:41,406
What would you want to tell yourself,

1065
00:51:41,406 --> 00:51:43,007
your earlier career self,

1066
00:51:43,007 --> 00:51:44,749
about how to make your career last?

1067
00:51:44,749 --> 00:51:47,593
And Tommy replied with the very colorful,

1068
00:51:47,593 --> 00:51:49,595
only be loyal to those who are loyal to you

1069
00:51:49,595 --> 00:51:54,361
and lawyer the fuck up.

1070
00:51:54,361 --> 00:51:54,441
Wow.

1071
00:51:54,441 --> 00:51:54,521
Wow.

1072
00:51:55,926 --> 00:51:58,387
Well, my answer would be very simple.

1073
00:51:58,387 --> 00:52:04,369
One of the things Mark Twain, he once expressed, it's been said in many ways, but he wrote

1074
00:52:04,369 --> 00:52:07,871
that comparison is the death of joy.

1075
00:52:07,871 --> 00:52:11,192
And if I could have told myself that, even when I was 10 years old or 15 or whatever,

1076
00:52:11,192 --> 00:52:14,053
that would have changed my life tremendously.

1077
00:52:14,053 --> 00:52:15,874
I am very thankful for where I am.

1078
00:52:15,874 --> 00:52:20,876
I have no regrets about all my different paths, but thinking about others and where they are

1079
00:52:20,876 --> 00:52:22,996
and how good they are or bad they are, any of that.

1080
00:52:23,437 --> 00:52:26,578
and around this issue of stress and burnout and everything,

1081
00:52:26,578 --> 00:52:29,800
I hear it all the time when I talk to developers.

1082
00:52:29,800 --> 00:52:32,701
The one huge massive layer of stress

1083
00:52:32,701 --> 00:52:34,342
is that they're looking on social media,

1084
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:35,662
looking on Facebook and Twitter,

1085
00:52:35,662 --> 00:52:38,063
and they're going to this conference in Dubrovnik,

1086
00:52:38,063 --> 00:52:39,944
and they're going over here,

1087
00:52:39,944 --> 00:52:42,045
and here I am in my shithole still working,

1088
00:52:42,045 --> 00:52:43,866
and I'm depressed, and I'm angry,

1089
00:52:43,866 --> 00:52:44,907
and this game's not working,

1090
00:52:44,907 --> 00:52:46,327
and I can't get the build going,

1091
00:52:46,327 --> 00:52:47,548
all that kind of stuff,

1092
00:52:47,548 --> 00:52:49,249
and I think that layer of pressure

1093
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:51,290
is just like you're at the bottom of the ocean.

1094
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:55,011
And I just think you have to just stop comparing yourself

1095
00:52:55,011 --> 00:52:56,892
to what other people are doing around you

1096
00:52:56,892 --> 00:53:00,313
and just focus on what you do best, focus on your work.

1097
00:53:00,313 --> 00:53:03,974
Especially one of the things I see a lot

1098
00:53:03,974 --> 00:53:07,435
is when people say, I will never be as good as them.

1099
00:53:07,435 --> 00:53:10,977
I'll never be as good of an artist or programmer or whatever

1100
00:53:10,977 --> 00:53:12,717
and if you see people like that around you,

1101
00:53:12,717 --> 00:53:15,358
whether it's in your studio, at school or whatever,

1102
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,399
guess what, you just found a mentor.

1103
00:53:17,399 --> 00:53:20,460
Go ask them to help you to get better at what you're doing.

1104
00:53:20,460 --> 00:53:20,780
But that.

1105
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:24,583
That, I think, for me, would be a fundamental difference,

1106
00:53:24,583 --> 00:53:26,344
if I had just mined my own business

1107
00:53:26,344 --> 00:53:28,266
and focused on what I do best.

1108
00:53:28,266 --> 00:53:29,146
No comparisons.

1109
00:53:29,146 --> 00:53:30,007
Find a mentor.

1110
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:30,287
Yes.

1111
00:53:30,287 --> 00:53:30,848
Awesome.

1112
00:53:30,848 --> 00:53:30,908
Yes.

1113
00:53:30,908 --> 00:53:30,968
Woo!

1114
00:53:30,968 --> 00:53:31,088
Woo!

1115
00:53:31,088 --> 00:53:31,168
Woo!

1116
00:53:31,168 --> 00:53:31,248
Woo!

1117
00:53:31,248 --> 00:53:38,313
Woo!

1118
00:53:38,313 --> 00:53:38,714
Woo!

1119
00:53:38,714 --> 00:53:39,114
Woo!

1120
00:53:39,114 --> 00:53:39,714
Woo!

1121
00:53:39,714 --> 00:53:39,774
Woo!

1122
00:53:39,774 --> 00:53:39,854
Woo!

1123
00:53:39,854 --> 00:53:39,934
Woo!

1124
00:53:39,934 --> 00:53:40,915
Woo!

1125
00:53:40,915 --> 00:53:41,436
Woo!

1126
00:53:41,436 --> 00:53:42,616
Oh, Lord.

1127
00:53:42,616 --> 00:53:45,999
So I would say the stuff I look back on and

1128
00:53:46,926 --> 00:53:49,488
feel the worst about are the times when overwork

1129
00:53:49,488 --> 00:53:52,611
might have affected my relationship or my relationship.

1130
00:53:52,611 --> 00:53:57,235
So probably something like, you know,

1131
00:53:57,235 --> 00:53:58,716
tell Anna that you love her

1132
00:53:58,716 --> 00:54:01,078
and that you're grateful for her.

1133
00:54:01,078 --> 00:54:03,621
You know, we're married, everything's good.

1134
00:54:03,621 --> 00:54:09,166
But, you know, certainly that's the stuff I look back on

1135
00:54:09,166 --> 00:54:11,928
and it's like, man, she lived in the house with us.

1136
00:54:11,928 --> 00:54:14,150
She like was there the whole time.

1137
00:54:15,132 --> 00:54:18,873
She cooked for us, she did all sorts of things that lifted our spirits and made bashing possible.

1138
00:54:18,873 --> 00:54:22,994
So you know, I've said it a lot since then, but I should have said it more then.

1139
00:54:22,994 --> 00:54:34,777
So tell those you care about that you love them.

1140
00:54:34,777 --> 00:54:35,017
Okay.

1141
00:54:35,017 --> 00:54:35,997
I've been pretty lucky.

1142
00:54:36,526 --> 00:54:40,669
There's not a whole lot that I would have told myself to do differently 10 years ago aside from,

1143
00:54:40,669 --> 00:54:43,710
and you guys can guess this from the multiple things I've already said, like,

1144
00:54:43,710 --> 00:54:47,273
there's a handful of people I kind of wish I would have separated myself from sooner.

1145
00:54:47,273 --> 00:54:51,375
You know, people who were like, just not awesome people.

1146
00:54:51,375 --> 00:54:56,078
And by awesome, I don't necessarily don't mean they weren't the greatest artist or programmer ever.

1147
00:54:56,078 --> 00:54:58,079
I mean, they were just not nice people.

1148
00:54:58,079 --> 00:55:00,301
They were just very selfish or very this or very that.

1149
00:55:00,301 --> 00:55:03,142
And like, they made my life worse.

1150
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:05,724
And as soon as they were out of my life, my life got 10x better.

1151
00:55:07,349 --> 00:55:07,429
Oh.

1152
00:55:07,429 --> 00:55:07,549
Oh.

1153
00:55:07,549 --> 00:55:07,689
Yeah.

1154
00:55:07,689 --> 00:55:07,829
Yeah.

1155
00:55:07,829 --> 00:55:08,189
Yeah.

1156
00:55:08,189 --> 00:55:08,270
Yeah.

1157
00:55:08,270 --> 00:55:08,390
Yeah.

1158
00:55:08,390 --> 00:55:08,490
Yeah.

1159
00:55:08,490 --> 00:55:14,912
Yeah.

1160
00:55:14,912 --> 00:55:17,834
So we've got about three and a half minutes for questions.

1161
00:55:17,834 --> 00:55:19,214
And there are microphones right here.

1162
00:55:19,214 --> 00:55:21,395
But the good news is we will be hanging out

1163
00:55:21,395 --> 00:55:23,016
in one of the wrap up rooms afterwards

1164
00:55:23,016 --> 00:55:24,577
if you have more questions that don't get asked.

1165
00:55:24,577 --> 00:55:25,957
So come on up to the microphone,

1166
00:55:25,957 --> 00:55:27,098
give us your quick question,

1167
00:55:27,098 --> 00:55:28,138
and we'll see what we can answer.

1168
00:55:31,598 --> 00:55:37,260
Ian Schreiber, RIT. Many people here are students, faculty, or people who mentor them.

1169
00:55:37,260 --> 00:55:42,642
For at the student level, there are some people in higher ed that say, that take

1170
00:55:42,642 --> 00:55:45,423
the thing of we need to teach how to take care of yourself, how to work in a

1171
00:55:45,423 --> 00:55:49,845
safe and sane way. There are others that say, well, lots of parts of the industry

1172
00:55:49,845 --> 00:55:53,326
suck. A lot of these students are going to go to Carnte Studios. We need to

1173
00:55:53,326 --> 00:55:56,967
prepare them for it. How would you find the balance between those things?

1174
00:55:58,065 --> 00:56:03,107
So how do you teach students the balance between hard work

1175
00:56:03,107 --> 00:56:04,647
and sustainable work?

1176
00:56:04,647 --> 00:56:09,609
Well, how do you balance the fact that industry

1177
00:56:09,609 --> 00:56:11,150
is going to have some crunchy studios

1178
00:56:11,150 --> 00:56:13,151
that students will go to and you are,

1179
00:56:13,151 --> 00:56:15,932
and part of our role is to prepare students

1180
00:56:15,932 --> 00:56:19,253
for that eventuality versus, you know,

1181
00:56:19,253 --> 00:56:20,194
not burning our students out

1182
00:56:20,194 --> 00:56:21,534
before they even get to industry.

1183
00:56:21,534 --> 00:56:22,535
So how do you prepare students

1184
00:56:22,535 --> 00:56:24,656
for the reality of the industry as it is

1185
00:56:24,656 --> 00:56:26,516
while teaching them to try and be better?

1186
00:56:26,516 --> 00:56:26,697
Yes. Okay.

1187
00:56:28,222 --> 00:56:30,222
That's a great question.

1188
00:56:30,222 --> 00:56:34,985
And you all have answers to this concrete ones, right?

1189
00:56:34,985 --> 00:56:38,766
I mean, I've actually been involved in a lot of educational programs,

1190
00:56:38,766 --> 00:56:40,067
especially in Europe.

1191
00:56:40,067 --> 00:56:42,988
And one of the things that some of them have done is try and model,

1192
00:56:42,988 --> 00:56:47,230
you know, they basically model themselves after a studio, an ideal studio.

1193
00:56:47,410 --> 00:56:52,573
So they try and model that behavior to the students in the process of education so that

1194
00:56:52,573 --> 00:56:56,535
they can take that model and bring that expectation to their employer.

1195
00:56:56,535 --> 00:57:01,058
One of the things I've also been mentoring a lot of students about is that when you go

1196
00:57:01,058 --> 00:57:06,801
into a job interview, you must be asking those questions about what's the work life like,

1197
00:57:06,801 --> 00:57:10,103
do you crunch here, what's your diversity numbers, all of that kind of stuff.

1198
00:57:11,424 --> 00:57:16,408
You know, and not only ask the question, but be willing to walk away if the question is

1199
00:57:16,408 --> 00:57:17,530
not what you want to hear.

1200
00:57:17,530 --> 00:57:21,914
That is super tough and it takes courage to walk away from your first job, but I've heard

1201
00:57:21,914 --> 00:57:26,518
some students who've done it and they felt instantly empowered because now I have a choice.

1202
00:57:26,518 --> 00:57:27,199
I wasn't desperate.

1203
00:57:27,199 --> 00:57:30,923
And I think we have to encourage students to be able to do that and make that choice

1204
00:57:30,923 --> 00:57:31,783
for their own benefit.

1205
00:57:33,757 --> 00:57:35,740
So in other words, teach students to ask good questions.

1206
00:57:35,740 --> 00:57:38,385
Training programs need to model the ideal.

1207
00:57:38,385 --> 00:57:38,545
Yes.

1208
00:57:38,545 --> 00:57:38,966
Cool.

1209
00:57:38,966 --> 00:57:42,431
I'm going to add one thing to that, which is that because I

1210
00:57:43,598 --> 00:57:46,639
Like, I agree with that, and then at the same time, I know,

1211
00:57:46,639 --> 00:57:49,860
because it's just the reality of life, that there's going to

1212
00:57:49,860 --> 00:57:52,081
be a bunch of young people out there who are going to feel

1213
00:57:52,081 --> 00:57:56,102
like they only have one job offer, and they've spent the

1214
00:57:56,102 --> 00:57:58,063
last four years trying to get in the game industry.

1215
00:57:58,063 --> 00:58:01,684
You better believe they're going to take that job offer.

1216
00:58:01,684 --> 00:58:04,825
Even if they're going into a studio that they

1217
00:58:04,825 --> 00:58:05,945
know crunches 24-7.

1218
00:58:05,945 --> 00:58:07,826
So given that.

1219
00:58:08,286 --> 00:58:11,848
I guess what I'd say, and I realize this is hard,

1220
00:58:11,848 --> 00:58:13,769
because 90% of this room is introverts,

1221
00:58:13,769 --> 00:58:16,010
and I'm a secret introvert too, so I get it,

1222
00:58:16,010 --> 00:58:19,292
is you just have to always be networking.

1223
00:58:19,292 --> 00:58:21,413
You have to make an enormous effort

1224
00:58:21,413 --> 00:58:23,414
to make sure that you meet other people,

1225
00:58:23,414 --> 00:58:24,574
that you get your name out there,

1226
00:58:24,574 --> 00:58:26,955
that you have eventually other options,

1227
00:58:26,955 --> 00:58:29,497
because yeah, you might find yourself

1228
00:58:29,497 --> 00:58:31,178
feeling like you're being forced to take a job

1229
00:58:31,178 --> 00:58:33,919
at a place that has an unhealthy culture

1230
00:58:33,919 --> 00:58:35,060
in some way, shape, or form.

1231
00:58:35,360 --> 00:58:36,740
And I'm not gonna judge you for doing that.

1232
00:58:36,740 --> 00:58:39,622
Like, if you feel like you really have to do that to break in, so be it.

1233
00:58:39,622 --> 00:58:40,603
Like, do that.

1234
00:58:40,603 --> 00:58:42,744
I mean, I worked like a mule when I was in my 20s.

1235
00:58:42,744 --> 00:58:45,805
I mean, I'm not gonna criticize anyone for that.

1236
00:58:45,805 --> 00:58:51,188
But like, the reason I'm not still doing that is because I forced myself out of my box

1237
00:58:51,188 --> 00:58:54,410
and that worked more than I thought was physically possible.

1238
00:58:54,410 --> 00:58:57,011
Um, you know, because again, secret introvert.

1239
00:58:57,011 --> 00:58:58,232
So, yeah.

1240
00:58:58,232 --> 00:59:00,753
So, um, we just got the call for time.

1241
00:59:00,753 --> 00:59:03,115
Where is the Meetup room for further questions?

1242
00:59:04,261 --> 00:59:08,920
2-0-4, okay, we will be in room 2-0-4, but thank you all.
