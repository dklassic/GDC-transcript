1
00:00:06,409 --> 00:00:08,089
Hello, welcome, and thank you for coming.

2
00:00:08,089 --> 00:00:10,790
This is creating living, breathing key art

3
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:12,270
for your front end.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:14,091
My name is D. Reid Monroe.

5
00:00:14,091 --> 00:00:16,291
I'm a presentation director at Ubisoft

6
00:00:16,291 --> 00:00:19,232
here in San Francisco, but until very recently,

7
00:00:19,232 --> 00:00:21,833
I was actually at Telltale Games for five years

8
00:00:21,833 --> 00:00:23,373
where I was the UI director.

9
00:00:23,373 --> 00:00:27,534
Can I begin by just getting a show of hands real quick?

10
00:00:27,534 --> 00:00:30,695
Who in the room works on UI or is responsible for UI

11
00:00:30,695 --> 00:00:32,916
or front end development in your studio?

12
00:00:34,484 --> 00:00:35,744
Okay, cool. It's about half, maybe.

13
00:00:35,744 --> 00:00:39,126
Well, regardless if you raised your hand or not,

14
00:00:39,126 --> 00:00:42,407
I think it's important we start with this term.

15
00:00:42,407 --> 00:00:44,167
So we're all on the same page.

16
00:00:44,167 --> 00:00:46,208
I'm defining front-end key art as

17
00:00:46,208 --> 00:00:49,409
the primary animated audio-visual

18
00:00:49,409 --> 00:00:52,310
within your video game front-end.

19
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:53,290
Or, to put it more simply,

20
00:00:53,290 --> 00:00:57,772
it's the first thing you see when the game boots up.

21
00:00:57,772 --> 00:01:01,593
It's the living, breathing visual behind the menu.

22
00:01:04,910 --> 00:01:14,275
It's Batman in Arkham City, the black and white alleyway from L.A. Noire, and the Phantom

23
00:01:14,275 --> 00:01:15,315
Thieves in Persona 5.

24
00:01:15,315 --> 00:01:23,680
And while I could happily spend all my time up here on stage pointing out examples of

25
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,541
what front-end key art could be, it's important to note what it's not.

26
00:01:26,541 --> 00:01:29,423
Front-end key art is not marketing key art.

27
00:01:30,577 --> 00:01:32,958
And while they can be similar and often are,

28
00:01:32,958 --> 00:01:36,340
the two, I believe, have fundamentally different roles.

29
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:40,343
It's marketing's job to get the player into the game,

30
00:01:40,343 --> 00:01:43,025
where it's the front end's job

31
00:01:43,025 --> 00:01:45,846
to get the player prepared to play the game.

32
00:01:49,894 --> 00:01:51,254
So over the next 30 minutes,

33
00:01:51,254 --> 00:01:54,455
I wanna focus on just the front-end key art.

34
00:01:54,455 --> 00:01:58,916
And hopefully pass on an appreciation

35
00:01:58,916 --> 00:02:01,717
both for its promise, but also the path to creating it.

36
00:02:01,717 --> 00:02:03,858
I'm gonna do this by very quickly outlining

37
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:08,539
why I believe front-end key art is important.

38
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:10,720
Next, I'll identify the things

39
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:12,600
that great front-end key arts do,

40
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,500
so that they're successful.

41
00:02:14,570 --> 00:02:16,872
And finally, I'm gonna share with you

42
00:02:16,872 --> 00:02:18,654
some of my work at Telltale Games,

43
00:02:18,654 --> 00:02:22,017
as well as some of the lessons I learned along the way.

44
00:02:22,017 --> 00:02:26,621
So without further ado, let's begin, shall we?

45
00:02:26,621 --> 00:02:30,725
Let's break this question down.

46
00:02:30,725 --> 00:02:34,929
If you one day find yourself being asked

47
00:02:34,929 --> 00:02:37,392
to defend an investment in front-end key art,

48
00:02:37,392 --> 00:02:38,973
consider these points.

49
00:02:40,459 --> 00:02:42,481
Why is the front end key art important?

50
00:02:42,481 --> 00:02:45,163
Well, for starters, it's a guaranteed first impression.

51
00:02:45,163 --> 00:02:48,785
The end user has to come in through the front end

52
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,126
to play the game.

53
00:02:50,126 --> 00:02:50,987
Or another way to look at it,

54
00:02:50,987 --> 00:02:56,031
it's the last opportunity to shape your audience's opinion

55
00:02:56,031 --> 00:02:57,652
before the game begins.

56
00:02:57,652 --> 00:03:01,835
Secondly, if your game's a success, knock on wood,

57
00:03:01,835 --> 00:03:04,137
your end user's gonna return over and over again,

58
00:03:04,137 --> 00:03:06,439
and they're gonna see the front end key art a lot.

59
00:03:06,439 --> 00:03:07,660
So it's an investment.

60
00:03:09,616 --> 00:03:11,376
Thirdly, as I mentioned just earlier,

61
00:03:11,376 --> 00:03:13,157
the front end has a responsibility

62
00:03:13,157 --> 00:03:15,297
to prepare the player to play the game.

63
00:03:15,297 --> 00:03:18,078
And the front end key art can do that,

64
00:03:18,078 --> 00:03:19,918
and I'll get to that in just a bit.

65
00:03:19,918 --> 00:03:23,879
And finally, the front end key art

66
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:25,920
is an opportunity for your title to stand out.

67
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,421
Destructoid, in their review of Telltale's

68
00:03:28,421 --> 00:03:32,182
Guardians of the Galaxy game,

69
00:03:32,182 --> 00:03:34,922
reserved the first six paragraphs

70
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:37,383
to discussing just the front end key art.

71
00:03:39,451 --> 00:03:42,436
While the press generally tends to forego UI

72
00:03:42,436 --> 00:03:45,182
and only harp on it if there's an issue,

73
00:03:45,182 --> 00:03:46,985
this review proves that the UI team

74
00:03:46,985 --> 00:03:49,450
can make a notable contribution to your game

75
00:03:49,450 --> 00:03:50,632
with the front-end keyer.

76
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:58,922
The answer to this question is simple.

77
00:03:58,922 --> 00:04:01,365
Great front-end key art prepares the player

78
00:04:01,365 --> 00:04:02,526
to play the game.

79
00:04:02,526 --> 00:04:05,288
And regardless of your platform, budget, or genre,

80
00:04:05,288 --> 00:04:07,511
I believe there's just three things

81
00:04:07,511 --> 00:04:08,532
that every front-end key art can do

82
00:04:08,532 --> 00:04:10,053
to fulfill this responsibility.

83
00:04:10,053 --> 00:04:11,194
Prime, inform, and adapt.

84
00:04:20,413 --> 00:04:24,115
Prime is most commonly executed of the three.

85
00:04:24,115 --> 00:04:26,917
It's about preparing the user emotionally

86
00:04:26,917 --> 00:04:28,678
for the experience they're about to have.

87
00:04:28,678 --> 00:04:35,343
For example, it's the endless mayhem of Space Marine.

88
00:04:35,343 --> 00:04:40,166
Here, the key art is essentially a giant love letter

89
00:04:40,166 --> 00:04:43,108
to its core combat and puts a player in a trance,

90
00:04:43,108 --> 00:04:46,851
priming their blood list, getting them ready for the game.

91
00:04:49,499 --> 00:04:53,843
But Prime can also be about subverting expectations, seen here in Kanan Lynch 2.

92
00:04:53,843 --> 00:05:00,409
Here the key art does the opposite of Space Marine, and contrasts the violence within

93
00:05:00,409 --> 00:05:00,629
the game.

94
00:05:00,629 --> 00:05:05,153
Instead of embracing the game's tone, the front end smartly stays at arm's length, and

95
00:05:05,153 --> 00:05:08,576
serves as the necessary pause before the plunge.

96
00:05:14,261 --> 00:05:20,183
Inform. Inform is the flip side of Prime, where Prime is about triggering an emotional response,

97
00:05:20,183 --> 00:05:24,084
Inform is more cerebral and about challenging the players to think.

98
00:05:24,084 --> 00:05:27,206
Here we want to teach them something, show them something they don't know,

99
00:05:27,206 --> 00:05:30,827
give them information that will color, affect, or influence how they play.

100
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:34,808
It doesn't even have to be overt. Perhaps it's subliminal?

101
00:05:34,808 --> 00:05:38,650
Like Overwatch's lovable front end.

102
00:05:40,782 --> 00:05:44,825
Blizzard could have easily scripted it to show you your favorite character,

103
00:05:44,825 --> 00:05:47,266
or perhaps the character you played last, but they didn't.

104
00:05:47,266 --> 00:05:50,429
Instead, the characters randomly appear and inform,

105
00:05:50,429 --> 00:05:53,931
perhaps on a subliminal level, your next character selection.

106
00:05:53,931 --> 00:05:59,474
But what's smart is from time to time the key art does double duty,

107
00:05:59,474 --> 00:06:03,857
and also informs players about the latest events and content.

108
00:06:03,857 --> 00:06:04,238
So good.

109
00:06:04,238 --> 00:06:08,801
Dirt 2, on the other hand, informs in a completely different way.

110
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:17,461
Here, the key art informs the world and brings a whole new perspective to what would merely be a driving game.

111
00:06:17,461 --> 00:06:23,943
It also provides important context like, where are we and why are we racing?

112
00:06:23,943 --> 00:06:28,724
And thirdly, there's adapt.

113
00:06:28,724 --> 00:06:32,385
If your key art doesn't update, what kind of a message does that send to your users?

114
00:06:32,385 --> 00:06:38,766
If you want your user to come back again and again, then your presentation should adapt and evolve.

115
00:06:41,137 --> 00:06:44,939
like spec ops the line here.

116
00:06:44,939 --> 00:06:46,660
Each time the player returns to the front end,

117
00:06:46,660 --> 00:06:49,942
we see the key art update to show both the passage of time,

118
00:06:49,942 --> 00:06:52,444
but also the visual consequences

119
00:06:52,444 --> 00:06:53,564
from events within the game.

120
00:06:53,564 --> 00:07:00,889
Or it's the swapping environments of Valve's Portal 2.

121
00:07:00,889 --> 00:07:04,752
Here, the entire key art is replaced with new environments

122
00:07:04,752 --> 00:07:06,613
as the player progresses through the game.

123
00:07:08,828 --> 00:07:13,792
And kudos to Portal 2, as even their loading screen evolves.

124
00:07:13,792 --> 00:07:18,776
So there you have it.

125
00:07:18,776 --> 00:07:20,357
Prime, Inform, and Adapt.

126
00:07:20,357 --> 00:07:23,820
A good key art will do one of these, perhaps two,

127
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:27,903
but a truly great, successful front-end key art

128
00:07:27,903 --> 00:07:30,625
will strive for all three.

129
00:07:30,625 --> 00:07:33,107
Would you like to see my favorite example that does that?

130
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,641
I'm cheating a little bit.

131
00:07:43,641 --> 00:07:48,064
While not a video game, HBO's Game of Thrones opening credit

132
00:07:48,064 --> 00:07:52,046
sequence epitomizes what a great front-end key art should do.

133
00:07:52,046 --> 00:07:55,108
Each week as returning audiences tune in,

134
00:07:55,108 --> 00:07:58,309
the sequence primes, heightening the viewer's anticipation

135
00:07:58,309 --> 00:07:59,730
with music and visuals.

136
00:07:59,730 --> 00:08:04,353
It informs, reminding viewers of location names, sigils.

137
00:08:04,353 --> 00:08:08,355
And it adapts, reflecting omitted locations,

138
00:08:08,355 --> 00:08:09,776
as well as adding new ones.

139
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:17,692
But what I also want to show you is something else.

140
00:08:17,692 --> 00:08:19,073
Note how the opening credit sits.

141
00:08:19,073 --> 00:08:22,196
It's positioned between marketing

142
00:08:22,196 --> 00:08:24,638
and the individual episodes.

143
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:26,319
Each one is very different,

144
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,581
however each one is essential to the overall experience.

145
00:08:29,581 --> 00:08:33,664
Now compare that with a video game front end,

146
00:08:33,664 --> 00:08:37,167
which is also positioned between marketing and its content.

147
00:08:38,459 --> 00:08:41,741
In both examples, neither the left, marketing,

148
00:08:41,741 --> 00:08:45,744
nor the right, the content, can do what the center does.

149
00:08:45,744 --> 00:08:47,265
And that's why I love this example.

150
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:49,266
HBO's Game of Thrones credit sequence

151
00:08:49,266 --> 00:08:53,389
demonstrates two things extremely well.

152
00:08:53,389 --> 00:08:57,111
It does a great job at preparing its audience,

153
00:08:57,111 --> 00:09:01,474
and it's unafraid to become something altogether unique,

154
00:09:01,474 --> 00:09:03,415
and that's what a great front-end key art

155
00:09:03,415 --> 00:09:04,356
should strive to do.

156
00:09:09,690 --> 00:09:12,755
Now, for the rest of the time I have here with you today,

157
00:09:12,755 --> 00:09:14,858
I'd like to share with you not only some of the work

158
00:09:14,858 --> 00:09:18,224
that I've been fortunate enough to make at Telltale Games,

159
00:09:18,224 --> 00:09:21,348
but also five lessons I learned along the way,

160
00:09:21,348 --> 00:09:22,530
making Front End Cure.

161
00:09:30,248 --> 00:09:32,329
During my first week at Telltale Games,

162
00:09:32,329 --> 00:09:35,130
one of its co-founders, Kevin Bruner,

163
00:09:35,130 --> 00:09:37,690
pulled me aside to his office

164
00:09:37,690 --> 00:09:39,211
and taught me this important lesson.

165
00:09:39,211 --> 00:09:42,592
He explained that production and design constraints

166
00:09:42,592 --> 00:09:44,652
on the Back to the Future game

167
00:09:44,652 --> 00:09:46,953
ended up minimizing the role of the DeLorean.

168
00:09:46,953 --> 00:09:49,654
And when they finally realized it,

169
00:09:49,654 --> 00:09:52,754
it was too late in development to change the game,

170
00:09:52,754 --> 00:09:55,395
but the front end, which had yet to be finalized,

171
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:58,876
could perhaps compensate for this oversight.

172
00:10:00,562 --> 00:10:03,204
And so the DeLorean became the front end key art.

173
00:10:03,204 --> 00:10:06,667
And by doing so, they made sure an underrepresented aspect

174
00:10:06,667 --> 00:10:08,489
of the Back to the Future brand got its due.

175
00:10:08,489 --> 00:10:12,192
Kevin's takeaway here was that the front end

176
00:10:12,192 --> 00:10:17,797
could be used to pave over any perceived holes in the game.

177
00:10:21,338 --> 00:10:25,440
And we used this approach on Telltale's Minecraft story mode.

178
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,381
Once again, the development of the front end started late,

179
00:10:28,381 --> 00:10:30,582
and this afforded the UI team the opportunity

180
00:10:30,582 --> 00:10:32,763
to see the game for what it was,

181
00:10:32,763 --> 00:10:34,963
and not what it intended to be.

182
00:10:34,963 --> 00:10:37,524
And just like in Back to the Future,

183
00:10:37,524 --> 00:10:41,486
an important franchise aspect was underrepresented.

184
00:10:41,486 --> 00:10:45,587
Our version of Minecraft had very little blocks and building.

185
00:10:48,072 --> 00:10:51,735
So I began looking at ways to show building in the key art

186
00:10:51,735 --> 00:10:55,057
and quickly landed on time-lapse construction.

187
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:57,319
I then discovered, perhaps not surprisingly,

188
00:10:57,319 --> 00:11:00,762
that the Minecraft community had already modded

189
00:11:00,762 --> 00:11:03,965
the original game to achieve this effect.

190
00:11:03,965 --> 00:11:07,848
So pitching this idea was as simple as ripping these videos

191
00:11:07,848 --> 00:11:08,929
and suggesting we do something similar.

192
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:09,990
Voila.

193
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,413
And so for season one and season two of Minecraft Story Mode,

194
00:11:13,413 --> 00:11:15,475
the key art was time-lapse block building.

195
00:12:00,648 --> 00:12:06,011
While I'm happy with the results, I'm actually more proud of how this underrepresented aspect

196
00:12:06,011 --> 00:12:10,633
ironically circled back around into the game itself.

197
00:12:10,633 --> 00:12:15,195
You see the time lapse effect was so successful that they wanted it in the game.

198
00:12:15,195 --> 00:12:20,978
And so portions of the game were reworked at the 11th hour to take advantage of the

199
00:12:20,978 --> 00:12:23,039
key art's new block building tech.

200
00:12:23,039 --> 00:12:27,321
Now our characters were mining materials and building up structures in the game.

201
00:12:34,797 --> 00:12:38,660
As a wrapper of the product, the front end is ideally suited

202
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,961
both from an end user standpoint,

203
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:42,643
but also a development standpoint

204
00:12:42,643 --> 00:12:47,227
to surface and ensure these underrepresented pillars,

205
00:12:47,227 --> 00:12:49,089
characters, concepts are seen.

206
00:12:49,089 --> 00:12:51,771
Asking yourself what aspects of the product

207
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:54,394
are underrepresented gets this process started

208
00:12:54,394 --> 00:12:56,936
and should be the first question you ask yourself

209
00:12:56,936 --> 00:12:58,277
when you roll onto a new project.

210
00:13:04,064 --> 00:13:06,526
When Saul Bass, the renowned graphic designer

211
00:13:06,526 --> 00:13:10,649
most widely known for his film posters and title sequences,

212
00:13:10,649 --> 00:13:12,210
submitted his poster design

213
00:13:12,210 --> 00:13:13,851
for the horror classic The Shining,

214
00:13:13,851 --> 00:13:16,473
he could have easily with his clout

215
00:13:16,473 --> 00:13:18,474
sent over a solitary design.

216
00:13:18,474 --> 00:13:20,055
But he didn't.

217
00:13:20,055 --> 00:13:22,337
Instead he sent over four.

218
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:24,778
And that started a chain of correspondences,

219
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:27,720
excuse me, with the legendary director Stanley Kubrick,

220
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:29,521
where they collaborated and ultimately

221
00:13:29,521 --> 00:13:31,283
hammered out the treatment we know today.

222
00:13:32,438 --> 00:13:38,721
Why I love this example is it shows that even the best guys in the industry rely on options.

223
00:13:38,721 --> 00:13:44,383
Options don't show indecisiveness, but instead allow your creative partners to discover the

224
00:13:44,383 --> 00:13:45,864
best ideas.

225
00:13:45,864 --> 00:13:51,506
Saul Bass needed Kubrick's insight, just as Kubrick needed Saul's ideas and perspectives.

226
00:13:53,649 --> 00:13:56,992
Multiple options facilitates the involvement

227
00:13:56,992 --> 00:13:59,914
of key creatives and returns strengthens the end results.

228
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:02,356
But that's not the only reason you should prepare options.

229
00:14:02,356 --> 00:14:05,118
It gives production the confidence

230
00:14:05,118 --> 00:14:07,059
you're ultimately making the right choices.

231
00:14:07,059 --> 00:14:09,981
But it also provides additional opportunities

232
00:14:09,981 --> 00:14:12,844
to show off your or your team's strengths.

233
00:14:12,844 --> 00:14:14,965
But last, and perhaps most importantly,

234
00:14:14,965 --> 00:14:17,988
you never know how those multiple options

235
00:14:17,988 --> 00:14:19,088
will pay off down the road.

236
00:14:20,967 --> 00:14:24,768
For Minecraft, the time elapsed concept shown earlier

237
00:14:24,768 --> 00:14:27,108
was just one of many that we pitched.

238
00:14:27,108 --> 00:14:30,909
And from the unselected, two were repurposed

239
00:14:30,909 --> 00:14:33,390
and ultimately found a home within the game.

240
00:14:33,390 --> 00:14:36,911
One of those was this concept

241
00:14:36,911 --> 00:14:38,451
of projecting imagery on blocks.

242
00:14:38,451 --> 00:14:41,252
At the time, I was experimenting with

243
00:14:41,252 --> 00:14:43,512
rendered texture in our engine,

244
00:14:43,512 --> 00:14:46,253
and thought the simple, iconic Minecraft cubes

245
00:14:46,253 --> 00:14:48,593
could serve as canvases for images and videos.

246
00:14:50,232 --> 00:14:52,874
The other was a mind descent.

247
00:14:52,874 --> 00:14:55,896
Once again, here was another underrepresented idea.

248
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:59,318
We had very little mind in our Minecraft game.

249
00:14:59,318 --> 00:15:02,459
And so I made a parallaxing descent from cards.

250
00:15:02,459 --> 00:15:07,883
And at the same time, I was eyeing two telltale stables,

251
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,084
the stats and the credit screens.

252
00:15:10,950 --> 00:15:13,733
which served as each episode's conclusion.

253
00:15:13,733 --> 00:15:15,414
Both were basically flat and static

254
00:15:15,414 --> 00:15:17,936
and ripe for reimagining,

255
00:15:17,936 --> 00:15:20,539
especially on such a playful property like Minecraft.

256
00:15:20,539 --> 00:15:24,642
And so the individual stats became the sides of the cube,

257
00:15:24,642 --> 00:15:28,225
and the credit scroll was now the mind descent.

258
00:15:28,225 --> 00:15:31,048
And they were stitched together with a fun transition,

259
00:15:31,048 --> 00:15:33,890
giving Telltale perhaps its most unique end flow.

260
00:15:54,779 --> 00:15:57,920
The lesson here is that simply developing multiple options

261
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:01,941
has numerous benefits, and perhaps this is a no-brainer.

262
00:16:01,941 --> 00:16:04,501
But it's how I tackle all the projects,

263
00:16:04,501 --> 00:16:07,382
and if you can afford the time to explore them,

264
00:16:07,382 --> 00:16:10,502
I'd argue there's no healthier way to start.

265
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:18,664
On Batman, a Telltale series, like all my projects,

266
00:16:18,664 --> 00:16:20,064
I opened up the front-end key art

267
00:16:20,064 --> 00:16:22,025
to all members of the UI team,

268
00:16:22,025 --> 00:16:24,325
challenging them to bring their best ideas to the table.

269
00:16:25,728 --> 00:16:28,891
The process begins with an initial brainstorming session

270
00:16:28,891 --> 00:16:31,693
where we look for those underrepresented ideas,

271
00:16:31,693 --> 00:16:33,415
but we also look for differentiators.

272
00:16:33,415 --> 00:16:37,919
Those ideas are then grouped into related buckets,

273
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:40,781
and individuals are free to sign up and explore

274
00:16:40,781 --> 00:16:43,183
the concept bucket they're most interested in.

275
00:16:43,183 --> 00:16:47,107
Of all the concepts worth pursuing on Batman,

276
00:16:47,107 --> 00:16:50,370
it was duality and comic panels that bore the most fruit.

277
00:16:57,067 --> 00:17:03,169
Unlike Rocksteady's Batman, Telltale's Batman was going to embrace its comic book roots.

278
00:17:03,169 --> 00:17:06,509
And I would render, we would render the game using two nightlights.

279
00:17:06,509 --> 00:17:11,470
So this comic panel's concept was about highlighting that distinction.

280
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:18,532
But in the end, we ultimately spearheaded, uh, selected a more daring duality concept,

281
00:17:18,532 --> 00:17:21,412
spearheaded by one of my talented UI artists, Hane Lee.

282
00:17:22,073 --> 00:17:28,059
Telltale's Batman for the first time in a video game was gonna treat Bruce Wayne as an equal to Batman.

283
00:17:28,059 --> 00:17:31,983
And so this concept was about highlighting that split role using light.

284
00:17:43,181 --> 00:17:47,965
It's kind of like a magic trick.

285
00:17:47,965 --> 00:18:05,559
There's a mask that comes in just as the shadow hits the face and reveals the Bruce underneath

286
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:09,002
Batman's suit and vice versa.

287
00:18:25,088 --> 00:18:31,412
There's actually a couple lessons here, like create a process that can involve others,

288
00:18:31,412 --> 00:18:37,357
but the primary lesson is make sure you look for and lean into those differentiators in

289
00:18:37,357 --> 00:18:39,799
addition to looking for those underrepresented aspects.

290
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:44,702
Differentiators are those aspects that set your game apart, and if they're strong, they're

291
00:18:44,702 --> 00:18:46,824
going to make for really strong key art.

292
00:18:52,850 --> 00:18:55,752
My first project at Telltale Games was The Wolf Among Us.

293
00:18:55,752 --> 00:18:57,894
And early into production,

294
00:18:57,894 --> 00:19:01,557
marketing released this teaser image.

295
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,719
Despite the character being off,

296
00:19:04,719 --> 00:19:08,281
what was truly troubling is it promised a different game

297
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:10,143
from what the dev team was actually making.

298
00:19:10,143 --> 00:19:13,325
If you played The Wolf Among Us,

299
00:19:13,325 --> 00:19:16,507
you know that it's a colorful detective noir

300
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:19,049
and not whatever the left is promising.

301
00:19:20,087 --> 00:19:22,347
Now in marketing's defense, the image was early

302
00:19:22,347 --> 00:19:24,488
and they had very little to work with,

303
00:19:24,488 --> 00:19:28,370
but still it speaks to a disconnect between the two.

304
00:19:28,370 --> 00:19:32,191
Further complicating things was the source material.

305
00:19:32,191 --> 00:19:35,412
The popular Fables comic book series

306
00:19:35,412 --> 00:19:38,613
was associated with these fabulous covers.

307
00:19:38,613 --> 00:19:41,574
Not only did each issue completely reinvent the brand,

308
00:19:41,574 --> 00:19:44,395
but they looked nothing like our game's art direction.

309
00:19:46,040 --> 00:19:49,541
So there I was caught between the game marketing wanted to project,

310
00:19:49,541 --> 00:19:51,802
the colorful game the dev team was making,

311
00:19:51,802 --> 00:19:54,483
and the game that the Fables fans wanted.

312
00:19:54,483 --> 00:20:10,828
I tried to create something that I thought would please everyone.

313
00:20:10,828 --> 00:20:12,568
And I thought I had it.

314
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:13,628
We were going to see our hero.

315
00:20:14,745 --> 00:20:20,310
his inner wolf come through his glowing eyes.

316
00:20:20,310 --> 00:20:24,915
And we got very close, but there was just one problem.

317
00:20:24,915 --> 00:20:29,920
Marketing couldn't stomach the bright, cycling colors that the dev team was pushing for.

318
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,463
And in our defense, the game did take place in the 80s,

319
00:20:33,463 --> 00:20:36,626
and we were in the midst of that 80s aesthetic revival.

320
00:20:36,626 --> 00:20:39,609
Hotline Miami had just come out, Drive had just come out.

321
00:20:40,837 --> 00:20:45,942
And I knew in my heart to get people to swallow the fact that our heroes were Snow White and

322
00:20:45,942 --> 00:20:51,527
the Big Bad Wolf, we almost had to trick them into thinking they were cool and exciting.

323
00:20:51,527 --> 00:20:57,212
However, in the end, I was coached into safer territories, resulting in the compromised

324
00:20:57,212 --> 00:20:58,754
color scheme we shipped with.

325
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:11,730
to you soon.

326
00:21:36,616 --> 00:21:41,418
The lesson here is be aware, but not beholden to marketing

327
00:21:41,418 --> 00:21:42,218
and your precedence.

328
00:21:42,218 --> 00:21:44,719
I kinda need to remind myself this lesson

329
00:21:44,719 --> 00:21:46,360
every once in a while.

330
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,900
Don't be afraid to create and fight for something

331
00:21:48,900 --> 00:21:52,262
that is counter to expectations if what you're making

332
00:21:52,262 --> 00:21:55,723
is ultimately faithful to the game itself.

333
00:21:55,723 --> 00:22:00,125
While an awareness of marketing and precedence is important

334
00:22:00,125 --> 00:22:02,746
and almost essential, they shouldn't dictate

335
00:22:02,746 --> 00:22:03,766
the front-end QR.

336
00:22:04,337 --> 00:22:07,399
As I showed earlier, marketing and the front end have different jobs and they don't have

337
00:22:07,399 --> 00:22:08,099
to be always on the same page.

338
00:22:08,099 --> 00:22:08,419
It's okay.

339
00:22:08,419 --> 00:22:10,600
Way back before you guys were born, on my first game, the WALL-E video game, I foolishly

340
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:11,901
presented two front end key art designs that couldn't be made.

341
00:22:30,105 --> 00:22:34,006
One concept took the film's rough Pixar color script

342
00:22:34,006 --> 00:22:35,807
and tried to bring it to life.

343
00:22:35,807 --> 00:22:37,947
However, it wasn't feasible.

344
00:22:37,947 --> 00:22:39,828
We simply didn't have the bandwidth to create

345
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:43,689
what was essentially a cartoon for the front end.

346
00:22:43,689 --> 00:22:49,410
And the other concept was like a microfiche-like dive

347
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:52,031
through this robotic imagery and blueprints.

348
00:22:52,031 --> 00:22:54,771
This one couldn't be achieved technically.

349
00:22:54,771 --> 00:22:58,252
Our pipeline didn't support Z movement or depth of field.

350
00:23:01,155 --> 00:23:03,817
So in the end, I wasn't able to deliver on the success

351
00:23:03,817 --> 00:23:05,619
that either concept promised

352
00:23:05,619 --> 00:23:08,221
and learned this sobering lesson.

353
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:10,802
What you pitch has to be producible.

354
00:23:10,802 --> 00:23:17,167
Skip forward 10 years to Guardians of the Galaxy.

355
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,690
Unlike WALL-E, all of Guardian's key art designs

356
00:23:20,690 --> 00:23:22,211
were conceived with the limitations

357
00:23:22,211 --> 00:23:25,993
of both a single implementer and art engine in mind.

358
00:23:28,447 --> 00:23:33,070
And the winning concept was pitched as an anti-Age of Ultron credit sequence.

359
00:23:33,070 --> 00:23:37,774
Instead of pulling further and further out to see our heroes heroically pose together,

360
00:23:37,774 --> 00:23:43,518
we would instead see the Guardians of the Galaxy as the dysfunctional family they were.

361
00:23:43,518 --> 00:23:49,083
And it was this early test that made the pitch possible.

362
00:23:50,419 --> 00:23:57,764
Our confidence with the engine allowed us to prove that a single implementer

363
00:23:57,764 --> 00:24:04,849
could essentially pull this whole thing together with little to no animation support.

364
00:24:04,849 --> 00:24:10,833
Resulting in this.

365
00:24:36,972 --> 00:24:41,773
It's all rolling and riding, it's slipping and sliding, it's magic.

366
00:24:41,773 --> 00:24:49,475
And you, and your sweet design.

367
00:24:49,475 --> 00:25:02,158
The lesson here is keep yourself honest and prove that your ideas can be accomplished.

368
00:25:02,892 --> 00:25:05,392
preferably by you if possible, because in the end,

369
00:25:05,392 --> 00:25:08,593
you might be the one actually driving the front-end key art.

370
00:25:08,593 --> 00:25:10,933
That's not to say you can't ask for help or pull favors.

371
00:25:10,933 --> 00:25:13,753
For example, in the Guardians of the Galaxy key art

372
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:16,194
I just showed you, it had a professional lighting,

373
00:25:16,194 --> 00:25:18,474
VFX, and animation pass, but we made sure

374
00:25:18,474 --> 00:25:22,695
to keep that work contained, and limited to just polish.

375
00:25:22,695 --> 00:25:24,055
So, we're now at the end of the talk,

376
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:28,036
and I'd like to leave you with this.

377
00:25:28,036 --> 00:25:31,117
While not evident to the end user,

378
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:35,045
the front end key art's ultimate potential and success

379
00:25:35,045 --> 00:25:37,106
depends on your production's outlook.

380
00:25:37,106 --> 00:25:40,646
If the front end is viewed as just a utilitarian speed bump

381
00:25:40,646 --> 00:25:42,267
on the way into the game,

382
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:43,967
well then, that's what you're gonna get.

383
00:25:43,967 --> 00:25:46,327
But if you want your front end key art

384
00:25:46,327 --> 00:25:49,608
to be truly integral and a successful part of the product,

385
00:25:49,608 --> 00:25:51,468
there needs to be a willingness,

386
00:25:51,468 --> 00:25:53,429
a concerted effort by you

387
00:25:53,429 --> 00:25:56,009
to champion its potential within the office.

388
00:25:56,009 --> 00:25:58,350
It's not easy, believe me.

389
00:25:58,634 --> 00:26:03,178
And at times you might feel like you're alone, fighting for resources or permission.

390
00:26:03,178 --> 00:26:08,763
But if you persevere, you'll find yourself with ownership of an important cornerstone

391
00:26:08,763 --> 00:26:09,503
of your product.

392
00:26:09,503 --> 00:26:14,968
One that can be just as memorable, just as important as any other part of the game.

393
00:26:14,968 --> 00:26:15,148
Thank you.

394
00:26:27,614 --> 00:26:30,955
I got 1227, so I think there might be time for a question or two if there is.

395
00:26:30,955 --> 00:26:31,715
Hi David.

396
00:26:31,715 --> 00:26:31,915
Hi.

397
00:26:31,915 --> 00:26:39,937
First of all, thanks for this high quality presentation.

398
00:26:39,937 --> 00:26:44,979
Oh, I guess it's one gig, the PowerPoint.

399
00:26:44,979 --> 00:26:46,919
I think I might have the right.

400
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,280
Yeah, but it's worth it, I think.

401
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,081
So, I love also the relationship you...

402
00:26:54,070 --> 00:26:57,751
made with Game of Thrones for the three elements,

403
00:26:57,751 --> 00:27:00,632
prime, inform, and adapt.

404
00:27:00,632 --> 00:27:04,053
I was thinking about your opinion

405
00:27:04,053 --> 00:27:08,375
about adding interaction on top of that.

406
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:11,876
I know there is already the interaction with the menu.

407
00:27:11,876 --> 00:27:15,277
But how about a small thing in the background

408
00:27:15,277 --> 00:27:18,938
that the player could potentially control,

409
00:27:18,938 --> 00:27:21,738
or I don't know, like the lights or?

410
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:23,462
Wow, that's a good question.

411
00:27:23,462 --> 00:27:28,448
I think, I haven't gotten that one yet in all my times I've given this talk, but you're

412
00:27:28,448 --> 00:27:29,870
absolutely right.

413
00:27:29,870 --> 00:27:34,236
I think one of the advantages of the video game is that it is interactive, so it can

414
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:34,657
evolve.

415
00:27:34,657 --> 00:27:39,003
That's something that marketing typically can't do, you know, once they print the poster,

416
00:27:39,003 --> 00:27:39,363
it's done.

417
00:27:41,095 --> 00:27:42,916
But absolutely, interaction is one.

418
00:27:42,916 --> 00:27:50,059
We had one key art design for Minecraft where the hub or this key art was actually interactable.

419
00:27:50,059 --> 00:27:53,201
You could walk around and move things.

420
00:27:53,201 --> 00:27:54,482
Another good example is Dirt 2, right?

421
00:27:54,482 --> 00:27:59,164
As you're navigating the menus, you position the camera throughout the RV.

422
00:27:59,164 --> 00:28:02,806
So absolutely, that could be a fourth hidden pillar there.

423
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:03,086
Thanks a lot.

424
00:28:07,673 --> 00:28:08,213
Oh, hey.

425
00:28:08,213 --> 00:28:09,233
Hi.

426
00:28:09,233 --> 00:28:10,674
Great talk, by the way.

427
00:28:10,674 --> 00:28:11,274
Thank you.

428
00:28:11,274 --> 00:28:12,895
I have a question.

429
00:28:12,895 --> 00:28:19,938
As you said before, marketing art and front-end art could be different.

430
00:28:19,938 --> 00:28:20,098
Yes.

431
00:28:20,098 --> 00:28:20,618
That's okay.

432
00:28:20,618 --> 00:28:21,018
Yes.

433
00:28:21,018 --> 00:28:30,962
So what can you advise about UI which is used in front-end key art?

434
00:28:30,962 --> 00:28:36,084
How is it connected with UI in the game?

435
00:28:36,084 --> 00:28:37,405
That's a good question.

436
00:28:39,322 --> 00:28:42,665
It's okay to say that that can be different as well.

437
00:28:42,665 --> 00:28:45,868
I think ultimately it needs to be faithful.

438
00:28:45,868 --> 00:28:47,070
It's a flow, right?

439
00:28:47,070 --> 00:28:49,412
You start on one end where you don't know anything

440
00:28:49,412 --> 00:28:50,713
about the game and you're pulled in.

441
00:28:50,713 --> 00:28:52,055
And so marketing has one job.

442
00:28:52,055 --> 00:28:53,997
And then you're committed to the game,

443
00:28:53,997 --> 00:28:55,498
you're invested, you buy it,

444
00:28:55,498 --> 00:28:57,460
then the front end has to prepare you to play.

445
00:28:57,460 --> 00:28:58,942
And so it has a completely different job.

446
00:28:58,942 --> 00:29:01,144
And then vice versa, you then get in the game.

447
00:29:01,624 --> 00:29:05,612
now you have to actually play the game so the UI has a whole new set of responsibilities, the

448
00:29:05,612 --> 00:29:11,763
HUD. And I think it's okay if every step of the way it changes as long as it's doing the best

449
00:29:11,763 --> 00:29:13,446
job it can. Hmm? Thank you.

450
00:29:14,114 --> 00:29:16,175
Hi, thanks for the awesome presentation.

451
00:29:16,175 --> 00:29:19,695
I think it was equally as beautiful as some of the front key and key art stuff that you

452
00:29:19,695 --> 00:29:20,156
worked on.

453
00:29:20,156 --> 00:29:21,216
So, thanks for that.

454
00:29:21,216 --> 00:29:23,176
Just a real quick question.

455
00:29:23,176 --> 00:29:31,118
Have you worked on any VR or AR related stuff, mostly VR, and how have you tackled front

456
00:29:31,118 --> 00:29:38,260
end key art for players that are in that situation, you know, just getting started with the experience?

457
00:29:38,260 --> 00:29:40,701
Any tips or tricks you would suggest?

458
00:29:41,512 --> 00:29:43,193
I wish I had some.

459
00:29:43,193 --> 00:29:45,494
I've never even thought about working on VR.

460
00:29:45,494 --> 00:29:49,297
So that's a whole new dimension.

461
00:29:49,297 --> 00:29:55,401
I would imagine that just like interactivity is a pillar, then maybe your perspective is

462
00:29:55,401 --> 00:29:56,522
a pillar.

463
00:29:56,522 --> 00:30:03,046
Maybe somebody next year will come back and do an amendment to this talk.

464
00:30:03,046 --> 00:30:06,048
But yeah, I haven't really thought about it.

465
00:30:06,048 --> 00:30:06,288
Thanks.

466
00:30:06,288 --> 00:30:06,808
A lot of good stuff.

467
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:11,802
I think this might be the last one.

468
00:30:11,802 --> 00:30:12,162
Thank you.

469
00:30:12,162 --> 00:30:15,164
Yeah, you made a pretty big distinction

470
00:30:15,164 --> 00:30:18,366
between marketing key art and front-end key art.

471
00:30:18,366 --> 00:30:22,109
But a lot of the concepts you presented to me as a marketer,

472
00:30:22,109 --> 00:30:24,551
I think, are pretty compelling.

473
00:30:24,551 --> 00:30:27,933
So I'm curious to know if you have any thoughts about how

474
00:30:27,933 --> 00:30:30,675
a marketer might collaborate with a front-end designer

475
00:30:30,675 --> 00:30:33,356
to kind of unify that experience.

476
00:30:33,356 --> 00:30:33,977
Yeah, yeah.

477
00:30:34,591 --> 00:30:38,274
And I think there's no reason why they couldn't be similar.

478
00:30:38,274 --> 00:30:40,316
I think part of it is.

479
00:30:41,860 --> 00:30:44,682
marketing's job, they usually come in so late,

480
00:30:44,682 --> 00:30:47,764
they have a different perspective, the game is different,

481
00:30:47,764 --> 00:30:50,046
sometimes the front end people are so early,

482
00:30:50,046 --> 00:30:52,448
so things may have changed,

483
00:30:52,448 --> 00:30:55,911
but I would hope that if you are afforded the opportunity

484
00:30:55,911 --> 00:30:58,593
or the connections to reach out to the front end developers

485
00:30:58,593 --> 00:31:02,496
or vice versa, that you guys could get in sync early on

486
00:31:02,496 --> 00:31:05,358
and maybe meet regularly to kind of see

487
00:31:05,358 --> 00:31:07,900
how things are progressing, because the game will change,

488
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:09,101
you know, features will get cut.

489
00:31:09,521 --> 00:31:14,272
And you ultimately have to do the best job for your responsibility.

490
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:14,833
All right.

491
00:31:14,833 --> 00:31:15,214
Thank you.

492
00:31:15,214 --> 00:31:15,555
Thank you.

493
00:31:15,555 --> 00:31:15,916
All right.

494
00:31:15,916 --> 00:31:18,241
Thanks, everybody.

495
00:31:18,241 --> 00:31:19,484
Thanks for coming.
