1
00:00:05,503 --> 00:00:06,244
Okay, so

2
00:00:15,481 --> 00:00:20,684
So in physics, there's this idea, this idea that reality is like two different things happening at the same time.

3
00:00:21,124 --> 00:00:26,628
On the one hand, it's a world of particles, and objects, and events, basically the everyday phenomenal world that we live in.

4
00:00:27,288 --> 00:00:35,973
But at the quantum level, of course, it behaves more like a wave function, a field of possibilities, or overlapping potential realities, or what any Marvel fan knows as the multiverse.

5
00:00:37,154 --> 00:00:44,618
Now, Dr. Strange might have his own definition, but for our purposes, a multiverse is a good way to think about the nature of interactive story design.

6
00:00:46,318 --> 00:00:54,762
Because in a branching narrative game, we use logic and structure to create a sort of multiversal story tree that defines all the many possible paths through a narrative.

7
00:00:55,562 --> 00:01:04,947
But the story can only ever be experienced along a single path at a time, and it's these individual story branches where we give meaning, emotion, and value to the audience and to the players.

8
00:01:06,912 --> 00:01:09,833
So this talk is about how we do both of those things together.

9
00:01:10,333 --> 00:01:20,115
Using the left brain to create meaningful narrative structures, while using the right brain to tell a powerful and emotionally resonant story that satisfies players, no matter what branches they pick through the game.

10
00:01:22,216 --> 00:01:29,657
And I'm going to do that in the context of six principles that we followed when we were making As Dusk Falls, along with examples of how they show up in the game.

11
00:01:29,817 --> 00:01:32,118
Six principles for growing a tree in the multiverse.

12
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:38,615
OK, so before we dive in, I'm just going to tell you a little bit about me and about the studio.

13
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:41,390
I'm Brad Kane.

14
00:01:42,010 --> 00:01:47,134
I got started in the late 90s as a journalist covering what were then called story games.

15
00:01:48,355 --> 00:02:02,946
I worked as a producer at Pixar Animation Studios, as a screenwriter, designer, and narrative director on a bunch of different games, including some of the former Telltale, a few AAA titles, some live action projects at Netflix.

16
00:02:04,106 --> 00:02:08,990
And I spent over four years creating As Dusk Falls along with the talented team at Interior Night in London.

17
00:02:12,054 --> 00:02:22,042
The company, for those who don't know, was founded in 2017 by CEO and creative director Caroline Marchal as an independent studio dedicated to making cinematic narrative games.

18
00:02:22,583 --> 00:02:36,995
And our first game, As Dusk Falls, is a six-chapter original interactive drama about two families from different backgrounds whose paths cross at a motel in Arizona in 1998 and the events leading up to and in the aftermath of that one fateful night.

19
00:02:39,488 --> 00:02:46,772
Now, it's specifically a branching multi-protagonist story where player choice and player action determine how the narrative unfolds.

20
00:02:47,313 --> 00:02:55,638
It's what some people would call a choose-your-own-adventure game, where players can't see everything in one or even three or five playthroughs because there's just a lot of different paths to take through the story.

21
00:02:57,319 --> 00:03:00,620
Here's our launch trailer just to give you a sense of the tone and the look of the game.

22
00:03:04,663 --> 00:03:07,825
The thing about shadows, you can't escape them.

23
00:03:12,503 --> 00:03:23,931
You just learn to keep them behind you and look toward the light.

24
00:03:24,271 --> 00:03:27,594
I represent some business acquaintances of your father's.

25
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:37,581
You help me take care of my family, I'll help you take care of yours.

26
00:03:39,122 --> 00:03:40,463
You swear it won't happen again?

27
00:03:42,479 --> 00:03:48,266
We can make it through this.

28
00:03:48,686 --> 00:03:49,968
On the ground, now!

29
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:54,292
You're making a huge mistake!

30
00:03:54,312 --> 00:03:55,834
Daddy, don't go!

31
00:04:08,218 --> 00:04:11,279
All you had to do was keep your mouth shut.

32
00:04:11,619 --> 00:04:16,740
What are you doing?

33
00:04:17,100 --> 00:04:17,700
Improvising.

34
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,101
I'm not just gonna abandon you.

35
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:27,002
Family means sacrifice.

36
00:04:42,833 --> 00:04:57,537
All right, so we developed It's a great trailer

37
00:04:58,610 --> 00:05:03,757
So we developed the game with Xbox Game Studios, and we released day one on Game Pass last July.

38
00:05:04,638 --> 00:05:06,060
And the reviews were generally pretty positive.

39
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:08,604
We won Games for Impact at the Game Awards.

40
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:15,233
We've had writing nominations at several of the other award shows, along with various noms for directing, acting, music, and so on.

41
00:05:16,693 --> 00:05:31,732
So now when we started working on this game in 2017, we had a very specific goal in mind, which was to move the medium, the narrative game medium, away from like adapted games, adapted IP games and adventure games, towards something closer to prestige television.

42
00:05:33,595 --> 00:05:36,836
We were inspired by, and we're still inspired by, shows like these.

43
00:05:37,656 --> 00:05:41,837
These are shows defined by great writing, great storytelling, great characters especially.

44
00:05:42,537 --> 00:05:46,258
A lot of them are crime dramas like our game, but really it's about a certain creative bar.

45
00:05:47,018 --> 00:05:52,159
Our goal with this game was a TV-style experience for every player, whatever choices they made along the way.

46
00:05:53,019 --> 00:06:00,941
And that meant we needed to focus on things such as the inevitable technical glitch.

47
00:06:05,103 --> 00:06:08,044
such as having a great screenplay, priority number one.

48
00:06:09,604 --> 00:06:11,925
Choices that actually matter, not just the illusion of choice.

49
00:06:13,985 --> 00:06:18,246
Original stories, original IP, consistent pacing.

50
00:06:18,366 --> 00:06:23,808
Narrative game design is traditionally quite slow, and like I said, we were going for something closer to a season of television.

51
00:06:25,868 --> 00:06:33,010
Manageable production complexity, which for us would mean we could offer a wider choice field and have more flexibility for iteration and rewrites.

52
00:06:35,475 --> 00:06:41,523
An experience where all playthrough paths are valid and good, which is really important to us and I'll talk more about soon.

53
00:06:43,445 --> 00:06:47,130
And we also have a major multiplayer component in the game that I'll touch back on toward the end of the talk.

54
00:06:50,053 --> 00:06:51,836
So why does any of this matter?

55
00:06:54,708 --> 00:06:59,991
Well, at Interior Knight, we believe that branching storytelling is not a gimmick, but it's actually a medium.

56
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:10,636
And that when we create these games in a deep and approachable way, they can have mass appeal for gamers and especially for non-gamers, because people everywhere love good stories, they love games.

57
00:07:11,077 --> 00:07:19,421
People really like experiencing these things together socially, and they really enjoy learning about themselves and each other in the process, which is something that we offer through our games.

58
00:07:21,724 --> 00:07:22,804
So that was our starting point.

59
00:07:23,045 --> 00:07:27,266
Let's dive now into the creative process that led to the game we shipped last summer.

60
00:07:27,667 --> 00:07:29,687
And I just want to give you guys a spoiler warning.

61
00:07:29,767 --> 00:07:31,108
I'm going to be giving out a lot of them.

62
00:07:31,188 --> 00:07:37,431
So if you haven't played the game and you're really excited to experience the story firsthand, you can leave now, and I won't be offended.

63
00:07:39,051 --> 00:07:41,252
There goes Carolyn, creative director.

64
00:07:42,993 --> 00:07:45,334
All right, so like I said, there's these six principles.

65
00:07:46,654 --> 00:07:49,996
And the first is what I like to call no McKee, break McKee.

66
00:07:51,328 --> 00:07:54,031
Be a master of story structure so you can destroy it.

67
00:07:55,572 --> 00:07:56,533
Who is Robert McKee?

68
00:07:57,093 --> 00:08:04,921
For those who don't know, McKee is probably the best-known teacher of story structure, specifically cinematic story structure, meaning for movies and TV.

69
00:08:05,321 --> 00:08:06,742
People tend to either love him or hate him.

70
00:08:06,782 --> 00:08:07,683
He's very polarizing.

71
00:08:08,063 --> 00:08:14,369
But he knows his stuff, and a lot of screenwriters, especially when they're starting out, will take his three-day workshop or read his book, Story.

72
00:08:14,429 --> 00:08:16,031
It's kind of like a fundamental one.

73
00:08:17,912 --> 00:08:20,694
And there's lots of other great screenwriting teachers out there, too.

74
00:08:20,754 --> 00:08:22,436
This is just a sample of them.

75
00:08:22,776 --> 00:08:28,641
But what they all teach in one form or another is story, and specifically the art of story structure.

76
00:08:29,281 --> 00:08:31,263
So when we talk about structure, what do we actually mean?

77
00:08:32,524 --> 00:08:46,736
Well, it's this thing we all learned about in school that most people in this room probably understand, that stories have a beginning, a middle, and an end, that we can divide them into three acts, that there are inflection points like the inciting incident, the midpoint, the lowpoint, the climax.

78
00:08:48,260 --> 00:08:55,083
And the reason that story has this, looks like this, this shape, is that the shape itself is what creates emotional engagement.

79
00:08:55,503 --> 00:08:58,325
It's something that comes from deep within our psyche.

80
00:08:58,385 --> 00:09:02,187
Shape is like how we understand and make greater relevance of an emotional experience.

81
00:09:02,307 --> 00:09:04,888
It's why entertainment tends to look like this.

82
00:09:06,089 --> 00:09:10,993
And yet, it's really common for trained screenwriters to come into this medium of branching games.

83
00:09:11,393 --> 00:09:15,056
And they're ready to exercise their structure muscles that they learned in Hollywood.

84
00:09:15,677 --> 00:09:26,145
And they're surprised to hear narrative designers tell them, hey, your outline doesn't work, or that story is ignoring the player, or you're putting the story on rails, all these ideas.

85
00:09:26,406 --> 00:09:29,168
And everything they've been trained to do kind of fails.

86
00:09:30,652 --> 00:09:33,117
Spanner in the works, of course, is player agency.

87
00:09:33,578 --> 00:09:35,803
The need for the player to be at the center of the experience.

88
00:09:36,812 --> 00:09:45,617
So writers will then think, OK, well, I'll just create a screenplay, but then I'll insert some choices in between the turning points and kind of choice-ify my script.

89
00:09:46,297 --> 00:09:49,058
But these are the moments that don't really matter, the ones in between the turning points.

90
00:09:49,199 --> 00:09:51,880
And so you get choices that don't feel like they matter either.

91
00:09:52,340 --> 00:09:53,601
You get the illusion of agency.

92
00:09:54,141 --> 00:09:56,082
Players can see through that, especially these days.

93
00:09:56,122 --> 00:09:59,564
We've had a lot of good branching games, and so there's kind of some knowledge around that.

94
00:10:00,064 --> 00:10:01,505
And everyone sort of throws rocks at the game.

95
00:10:02,566 --> 00:10:03,746
So what do we do?

96
00:10:03,886 --> 00:10:04,807
How do we solve this?

97
00:10:06,155 --> 00:10:07,737
Well, we have to break McKee.

98
00:10:09,178 --> 00:10:10,499
But not all the way, right?

99
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:18,727
We have to know classical structure well enough to know what you need to honor and what you can adapt in a game like this, what you can afford to lose.

100
00:10:20,629 --> 00:10:23,912
It won't work to skip an inciting incident or have a story without a climax.

101
00:10:24,092 --> 00:10:25,013
That would never feel good.

102
00:10:25,053 --> 00:10:26,634
It won't have the engagement we're looking for.

103
00:10:27,535 --> 00:10:34,182
But if the instinct is, in story terms, Jane starts the story lonely, and she begins to trust Clara at the midpoint.

104
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,385
They face a final problem as a team, and they wind up friends for life.

105
00:10:38,206 --> 00:10:42,089
That kind of model of things might be a little too rigid for what we do in these games.

106
00:10:42,229 --> 00:10:43,811
We have to break that a little bit.

107
00:10:45,232 --> 00:10:48,275
So let's look at an example of how we do this in As Dusk Falls.

108
00:10:48,295 --> 00:10:50,297
This is Vince.

109
00:10:51,195 --> 00:11:02,941
He is a former airline mechanic who, in book one of the game, is moving cross-country with his wife, his daughter, his father, to start a new life when they have to stop for the night at a motel in Arizona on Route 66.

110
00:11:06,142 --> 00:11:08,623
And that road trip is the starting point of the story.

111
00:11:08,864 --> 00:11:12,345
We can represent it as the first point on a story graph like this.

112
00:11:12,445 --> 00:11:15,787
It's the little yellow dot in the bottom left, if you guys can see that from back there.

113
00:11:18,274 --> 00:11:22,476
Now, if this were a movie, the inciting incident would typically happen at about the 10-minute mark.

114
00:11:22,616 --> 00:11:24,057
That's what the numbers are along the bottom.

115
00:11:24,097 --> 00:11:25,218
They're a reference point for film.

116
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:32,302
And in this case, it's when Vince, who we now understand has problems fighting for what he cares about.

117
00:11:32,402 --> 00:11:33,502
It's like his character flaw.

118
00:11:33,863 --> 00:11:38,245
He gets taken hostage with his family at the motel by the three Holt brothers.

119
00:11:40,306 --> 00:11:43,408
Now, in the movie, the story might continue something like this.

120
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:51,721
At the 30-minute mark, which is usually the start of Act 2 in traditional structure, Vince's worst fears are realized when his wife, Michelle, gets shot.

121
00:11:53,681 --> 00:12:05,523
And at the midpoint, when he can only send one hostage to safety, he kind of gets to be the one to decide who, he insists on sending her out, of course, but it means his impressionable young daughter, Zoe, is left inside with the gunmen.

122
00:12:07,784 --> 00:12:13,865
At 75 minutes, which is often a sort of false ending moment in story structure theory, it seems they're about to get rescued,

123
00:12:14,448 --> 00:12:19,350
But then the corrupt sheriff recklessly assaults the motel, putting everyone inside in danger.

124
00:12:20,871 --> 00:12:24,413
At our crisis or low point, Vince and his daughter get trapped in the burning motel.

125
00:12:24,473 --> 00:12:25,633
Things could get no worse for them.

126
00:12:26,294 --> 00:12:32,697
But at the climax, Vince finds his courage, fights off the bad guys, and ultimately sacrifices his life to save his daughters.

127
00:12:34,057 --> 00:12:35,358
Now that's a nice shape to the story.

128
00:12:35,418 --> 00:12:36,759
This curve looks nice and curvy.

129
00:12:38,159 --> 00:12:39,760
And it's going to feel pretty good if it's well written.

130
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,081
But in a narrative game, it's not enough.

131
00:12:42,181 --> 00:12:43,562
We also need the choices.

132
00:12:44,502 --> 00:12:50,684
And just as we can't offer meaningless choice, we also can't offer choices that do this to the story shape.

133
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:54,826
Because in that blue path especially, what's happening is the choices mattered.

134
00:12:55,466 --> 00:12:56,687
They've really changed the shape.

135
00:12:57,187 --> 00:13:01,469
But the story doesn't have really a recognizable shape anymore.

136
00:13:01,489 --> 00:13:04,510
It's not going to feel engaging or satisfying in the way you want it to be.

137
00:13:05,891 --> 00:13:13,376
So instead, what we have to do is we have to map the choices onto the inflection points of the story in a way that preserves enough of the structure to keep it meaningful.

138
00:13:15,097 --> 00:13:19,119
In the Vince example, it's going to be things like whether his wife gets shot or not.

139
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,201
That's a variable in our game.

140
00:13:21,621 --> 00:13:22,762
She might never get hurt at all.

141
00:13:22,822 --> 00:13:29,406
And in that case, their story becomes more about how they work together in a crisis with the kind of marital problems that they have going on.

142
00:13:31,583 --> 00:13:33,004
which hostage he sends to safety.

143
00:13:33,044 --> 00:13:34,285
Like I said, that's actually a choice.

144
00:13:34,785 --> 00:13:36,706
He might choose his father or his daughter.

145
00:13:37,447 --> 00:13:41,830
And the back half of the story takes on a whole different context, depending on what he picks.

146
00:13:43,551 --> 00:13:48,974
Instead of fighting the Holt brothers at the climax, he can choose to be their ally, fighting against the corrupt sheriff instead.

147
00:13:49,194 --> 00:13:51,296
Whole different path into the climax there.

148
00:13:52,276 --> 00:13:53,877
And there's lots of ways that book one can end.

149
00:13:53,937 --> 00:13:55,038
Vince can be dead or alive.

150
00:13:55,118 --> 00:13:57,900
He can be free or kidnapped, and so on and so forth.

151
00:14:00,054 --> 00:14:05,319
So here's a second curve, story curve, made from those same choice moments we just looked at.

152
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,983
And it looks kind of similar to the shape of the first yellow one that I put up.

153
00:14:09,123 --> 00:14:17,171
But if you superimpose them, they're different enough that the choices matter, but the experience and the shape still remain meaningful and engaging.

154
00:14:17,231 --> 00:14:18,452
It's still a story.

155
00:14:20,475 --> 00:14:26,978
Now, a classically trained writer might argue that there's always going to be one set of curves that's a little more perfect, a little more McKee.

156
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,499
I think McKee would probably say that.

157
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:32,200
And he's right in the context of a film.

158
00:14:32,280 --> 00:14:34,562
But what we get in the bargain here is player agency.

159
00:14:35,142 --> 00:14:39,124
And that is the compromise we have to make and that we're happy to make for a good branching game.

160
00:14:42,865 --> 00:14:43,386
Sip of water.

161
00:14:47,617 --> 00:14:50,899
OK, so principle number two, characters as questions.

162
00:14:52,501 --> 00:14:57,044
That title is a little misleading, because most characters in most stories are questions, actually.

163
00:14:58,805 --> 00:15:02,127
What will Walter White sacrifice in his quest to take control of his own life?

164
00:15:03,028 --> 00:15:06,731
Can Elizabeth II preserve tradition as the world around her modernizes?

165
00:15:07,711 --> 00:15:12,835
Can John Snow, a bastard from the North, save a world that doesn't care about him and hardly wants to be saved?

166
00:15:15,145 --> 00:15:19,527
These are all central story questions, which is to say they not only drive plot, but they also convey theme.

167
00:15:20,387 --> 00:15:22,268
And themes, as we know, are often binary.

168
00:15:22,988 --> 00:15:27,330
Things like fate and free will, nature versus nurture, the good of the many versus the needs of the few.

169
00:15:28,290 --> 00:15:30,351
Binaries lend themselves well to narrative games, of course.

170
00:15:31,792 --> 00:15:37,374
And in most movies and shows, the exploration of theme is closely tied to how characters arc.

171
00:15:38,905 --> 00:15:42,587
So this is a character arc example, rags to riches.

172
00:15:43,347 --> 00:15:45,028
We're all familiar with character arcs, I assume.

173
00:15:45,328 --> 00:15:46,969
Usually a character starts with one value.

174
00:15:47,409 --> 00:15:51,752
In this case, it would be rags and ends up somewhere different, riches.

175
00:15:52,772 --> 00:15:56,394
But that could be anything, selfish to selfless or shy to confident.

176
00:15:56,674 --> 00:15:58,675
The key is that they're diametric.

177
00:15:58,695 --> 00:15:59,956
They form two poles.

178
00:15:59,976 --> 00:16:04,098
They're not always super diametric, but there's a change implied in the character arc.

179
00:16:05,578 --> 00:16:08,901
Now, in a branching drama, we have character arcs also.

180
00:16:09,422 --> 00:16:16,389
But we tend to need to start our characters not at the initial point of a journey, like with the whole arc ahead of them, because agency.

181
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:20,853
So instead, it's more like in the middle there, beginning in the center of the curve.

182
00:16:21,654 --> 00:16:24,437
So the story can kind of go either way, rags or riches.

183
00:16:25,058 --> 00:16:26,179
And therefore, so can the meaning.

184
00:16:27,284 --> 00:16:35,194
In this example, maybe it means the protagonist starts out with a low-level corporate employee job, boring but stable salary.

185
00:16:35,294 --> 00:16:39,799
And the question is, will she make millions or will she lose everything over the course of whatever that story is?

186
00:16:40,901 --> 00:16:41,521
And here's the key.

187
00:16:42,723 --> 00:16:45,646
Each answer implies a very different thing about what that story meant.

188
00:16:46,525 --> 00:16:47,745
after you've seen it.

189
00:16:48,506 --> 00:16:58,489
So like in A Breaking Bad Game, for example, Walter White might have turned himself in and worked with his cousin Hank to take down the cartel, making it a sort of redemption story for him.

190
00:16:59,449 --> 00:17:05,271
Or in The Crown, the queen might choose to abdicate in the 90s, making hers a story about the triumph of modernity.

191
00:17:06,652 --> 00:17:16,035
And Jon Snow might have chosen to rule in tyranny with Daenerys, or even taken the Iron Throne for himself, turning his story into a tale of corruption and probably a better ending.

192
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,792
So how about As Dusk Falls?

193
00:17:21,993 --> 00:17:28,357
We're going to look now at how we built a story tree for the second main character, Jay, that took into account the variability of theme.

194
00:17:29,378 --> 00:17:40,986
Now Jay, for those who haven't played and didn't want to leave after the spoiler warning, is the youngest of three brothers who try to solve their family's debt problem by robbing the corrupt sheriff of Turok.

195
00:17:42,273 --> 00:17:49,339
But it all goes to hell when they get holed up at this motel with half a dozen hostages and the sheriff outside basically trying to kill them for various reasons.

196
00:17:51,561 --> 00:17:56,204
His theme question is, can Jay escape his toxic family without becoming just like them?

197
00:17:57,766 --> 00:18:00,007
Here's a short clip just introducing the three Holt brothers.

198
00:18:01,609 --> 00:18:04,711
You're always out skulking in the woods, climbing trees and all that.

199
00:18:04,751 --> 00:18:05,792
We all know you're good at it.

200
00:18:06,793 --> 00:18:08,034
And you want to help the family, right?

201
00:18:08,835 --> 00:18:09,575
You know I do.

202
00:18:10,276 --> 00:18:11,517
Then here's your chance.

203
00:18:12,228 --> 00:18:22,517
Okay, so those are the Holtz.

204
00:18:23,818 --> 00:18:30,784
And each episode typically has one or two major branching moments that relate to Jay's theme about his family identity, how he feels about that.

205
00:18:31,404 --> 00:18:34,667
Chapter one starts off pretty low stakes, because we're early in the story arc.

206
00:18:35,107 --> 00:18:40,232
And the question is just, does he get that money from the safe that they're talking about, or does he fail and disappoint his brothers?

207
00:18:42,119 --> 00:18:47,384
In chapter two, he's not actually playable in this one, but his story is still evolving and the stakes are still rising for him.

208
00:18:47,684 --> 00:18:53,710
Thematically, it's about whether his family is scraping by through a difficult night or are they kind of shooting hostages, making things a lot worse.

209
00:18:53,911 --> 00:18:55,772
It's kind of building toward where his story is going to go.

210
00:18:57,434 --> 00:19:05,582
In chapter three, Jay either sides with Vince or with his own family in a certain dilemma, further testing everything he believes about himself and his relationship to them.

211
00:19:07,793 --> 00:19:15,239
And then in chapter four, which in our game is the beginning of book two, and it properly kind of becomes Jay's story at that point, now the stakes kick into high gear.

212
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:20,263
Does Jay fight with his family until the bitter end, or does he abandon them and run for it on his own?

213
00:19:22,921 --> 00:19:29,405
In chapter five, his story is mostly about his relationship with his close friend Vanessa as he's kind of trying to get to the border and escape.

214
00:19:29,965 --> 00:19:35,108
But thematically, the stakes are getting huge for him because she represents his last best chance at personal redemption.

215
00:19:35,909 --> 00:19:43,053
So does he lie about his identity knowing that he could be putting her at terrible risk, or does he tell her the truth and face losing his only friend and ally?

216
00:19:44,714 --> 00:19:49,197
And finally, in chapter six, the stakes could be no higher, the font no bigger.

217
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:55,069
Does Jay escape to Canada at the expense of another person's life, or does he surrender to save his own soul?

218
00:19:56,790 --> 00:19:58,712
So those are the questions behind the story tree.

219
00:19:58,832 --> 00:20:01,894
And there's, of course, a lot of ways to cut out a branch that answers them.

220
00:20:03,956 --> 00:20:08,780
In this path here, Jay's journey is mostly one of safety and loyalty, you could say.

221
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:10,501
He's staying loyal to his family.

222
00:20:10,721 --> 00:20:11,702
He's loyal to his friend.

223
00:20:12,203 --> 00:20:15,125
But in a final twist, he actually kills an innocent person.

224
00:20:15,578 --> 00:20:16,378
to gain his freedom.

225
00:20:16,878 --> 00:20:23,900
And so the answer to his theme question could be said to be something like, you might escape a toxic family, but the toxicity lives on inside you.

226
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:30,921
Whereas, in this version, totally different path, his journey is a lot more turbulent along the way.

227
00:20:31,121 --> 00:20:32,181
He abandons his family.

228
00:20:32,441 --> 00:20:33,422
He deceives his friend.

229
00:20:33,822 --> 00:20:39,863
But in the end, he makes a very noble choice, and the answer to the theme question becomes that real freedom is about personal integrity.

230
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:44,075
And of course, there's other paths, too.

231
00:20:44,175 --> 00:20:45,636
It's not always black or white.

232
00:20:46,216 --> 00:20:53,219
But you always get the experience of exploring a theme and deciding how that character resolves, how that arc will go for you.

233
00:20:53,960 --> 00:21:02,384
And again, McKee would probably say that characters have one right ending because it's intrinsic to what their flaw is, who they are, must determine how they resolve.

234
00:21:03,004 --> 00:21:03,885
And again, maybe he's right.

235
00:21:03,945 --> 00:21:11,569
But for us, it's more interesting to let players explore that and figure out what it means to have that flaw and decide for themselves

236
00:21:11,929 --> 00:21:13,650
how it resolves and whether it resolves.

237
00:21:17,352 --> 00:21:20,313
Okay, on to principle number three, agency and consequence.

238
00:21:21,594 --> 00:21:27,456
So we talked about major inflection points and how you can manage choices so that you keep an overall dramatic structure.

239
00:21:28,577 --> 00:21:32,138
But in any given scene, there's still always this push and pull between story and design.

240
00:21:32,198 --> 00:21:35,020
It's kind of like the inherent conflict of these games.

241
00:21:35,791 --> 00:21:37,092
Story wants to tell a good tale.

242
00:21:37,312 --> 00:21:38,633
Design wants every choice to matter.

243
00:21:38,833 --> 00:21:41,034
Sometimes we have to find a balance, somehow.

244
00:21:41,254 --> 00:21:42,175
Somehow we have to find a balance.

245
00:21:43,376 --> 00:21:45,797
Now, not every choice can be world-shaking.

246
00:21:45,937 --> 00:21:52,181
Sometimes it's going to be more about probing the different sides of a character or adding flavor to an interesting moment.

247
00:21:52,781 --> 00:21:58,645
But at least once per scene in this game, we wanted a piece of meaningful, impactful agency that would really matter.

248
00:21:59,105 --> 00:22:01,927
And we called these, in our game, crossroads choices.

249
00:22:03,362 --> 00:22:06,184
In real life, when you reach a crossroads, your choices have ripple effects.

250
00:22:06,645 --> 00:22:08,986
Sometimes those are short term, sometimes they're long term.

251
00:22:10,928 --> 00:22:17,633
In episode two, for instance, chapter two, Vince has that key decision I mentioned about which hostage gets sent out of the motel to safety.

252
00:22:18,294 --> 00:22:20,515
He's got his wife, his father, his daughter.

253
00:22:20,976 --> 00:22:21,776
They're all inside.

254
00:22:21,896 --> 00:22:23,638
They all, for different reasons, need to get out.

255
00:22:24,178 --> 00:22:28,522
And depending on previous choices, the game presents the two best options for who that could be.

256
00:22:28,582 --> 00:22:31,564
It's a binary, determined by other things that have come before it.

257
00:22:32,742 --> 00:22:34,466
and that choice has consequences.

258
00:22:34,546 --> 00:22:40,218
Consequences that are immediate, consequences that are delayed, you could say, and then consequences that are quite long term.

259
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:49,768
So immediately after the choice, there's three different scenes that play out depending on who Vince is escorting outside for the hostage exchange.

260
00:22:50,548 --> 00:22:56,233
For instance, if it's his wife, then the act of saying farewell forces them to kind of face this issue they've had in their marriage.

261
00:22:56,273 --> 00:23:03,098
And they either kind of decide they're going to work on it and try to heal it, or that they're going to dissolve it and that this is probably a kind of goodbye for them.

262
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:11,885
Then there's delayed consequences, consequences where the ripple effects are felt in later scenes or even into the next episode, say.

263
00:23:13,137 --> 00:23:19,340
So if Michelle was shot and not rescued in that scene, she actually, spoiler, dies at the beginning of the next episode.

264
00:23:19,960 --> 00:23:25,243
Whether that's a painful death or peaceful death is still variable, depending on agency on the player's part.

265
00:23:26,464 --> 00:23:32,807
And if Zoe also wasn't rescued, meaning if Jim was the one who was sent out, then Zoe witnesses that, and it's hugely traumatizing for her.

266
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:38,824
And then in our game, there's actually these kind of longer term consequences.

267
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:43,769
For example, 14 years later, our story kind of spans quite a long period of time.

268
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:47,393
Michelle, if she lived, can be married or divorced.

269
00:23:48,214 --> 00:23:54,721
And Zoe, who is now 20, she has either lost Vince, or she's lost Michelle, or she's lost both of them, or she's lost neither of them.

270
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:55,903
A lot of different states for her.

271
00:23:56,932 --> 00:24:01,473
And Jim, too, the father, he has his own set of immediate, delayed, and long-term consequences.

272
00:24:02,333 --> 00:24:03,753
So it all kind of like ripples out.

273
00:24:03,813 --> 00:24:07,814
And all of it, in this case, links back to that one choice from Chapter 2.

274
00:24:10,535 --> 00:24:19,997
Now, the key to all this is that even as you accrue different levels of consequence, you still want to keep things interesting by layering on new crossroad choices, even as your consequences build up.

275
00:24:20,947 --> 00:24:21,647
This is Vanessa.

276
00:24:22,487 --> 00:24:25,028
She's that friend that Jay makes during his escape to the border.

277
00:24:25,608 --> 00:24:31,590
And a lot of how his story plays out toward the end depends on how his crossroad choices kind of intersect with her fate.

278
00:24:33,711 --> 00:24:38,152
This is not the most exciting visual aid you'll ever see, but it's super useful.

279
00:24:38,372 --> 00:24:39,092
We do a lot of these.

280
00:24:39,272 --> 00:24:40,953
It's like a two-by-two story matrix.

281
00:24:42,153 --> 00:24:45,474
It shows how two earlier sets of choices combine into a later scene.

282
00:24:46,567 --> 00:24:56,289
So along the top, it's this moment at the end of chapter 5 where Vanessa either stays with Jay for the duration of his story, or she's going to go her own way on player choice.

283
00:24:57,249 --> 00:25:13,412
And down the left-hand column there, it's a moment from the start of the next episode when Jay either bluffs his way past a police roadblock, or he kind of fails to bluff and he ends up being essentially chased by the cops on his journey north toward the border, toward Glacier National Park, in fact.

284
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:20,864
And the one there with the blue, this one is subdivided again by another slightly minor variable.

285
00:25:20,944 --> 00:25:27,308
So there's really five states going into the final act of his story in that episode, which is cool.

286
00:25:27,348 --> 00:25:28,629
It's cool to have five states.

287
00:25:29,029 --> 00:25:31,090
But that's still all consequence.

288
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:34,372
We still need to have agency.

289
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:43,938
So each of those five ranches has its own crossroad choice in the game, which further subdivides into a total of 10 outcomes, which is the light blue boxes there.

290
00:25:45,373 --> 00:25:49,735
So even though not every choice can matter, you just can't make a game where every choice matters.

291
00:25:49,775 --> 00:25:53,036
It's not going to probably be affordable and run into problems.

292
00:25:53,076 --> 00:26:06,121
But even though that's the case, if you keep on introducing important choices into your consequences that you're building up, you get a sort of layering effect where the choices constantly feel like they matter and players feel ownership over the story, which is really the goal.

293
00:26:09,062 --> 00:26:09,302
All right.

294
00:26:09,522 --> 00:26:12,143
Principle number four, A story and B story.

295
00:26:17,168 --> 00:26:22,369
So we wanted from the beginning with this game to do something a little different with points of view and non-linear storytelling.

296
00:26:25,130 --> 00:26:34,933
Almost all TV shows and films use some kind of A-B or A-B-C structure, with usually one main story intercut with one or more side stories.

297
00:26:35,865 --> 00:26:39,568
For instance, in Better Call Saul, it's definitely Jimmy McGill as the main character.

298
00:26:39,948 --> 00:26:43,871
But almost every episode, we spend a good chunk with Mike and his dealings with the cartel.

299
00:26:43,911 --> 00:26:45,032
It's the structure of that show.

300
00:26:46,092 --> 00:26:47,733
House of the Dragon uses an ensemble.

301
00:26:48,774 --> 00:26:51,436
The Wire cut back and forth between the cops and the criminals.

302
00:26:52,297 --> 00:27:03,545
And I put Lost up here, even though it's old, because their AB structure was usually the same character at different points in time, kind of jumping back and forward, which is kind of close to what we did in this game.

303
00:27:04,608 --> 00:27:13,612
Our idea was that every episode would have an A story and a B story where the B story takes place at some point in the past and affects the future as seen in the A story.

304
00:27:16,253 --> 00:27:22,496
Now sometimes that B story would be an hour in the past, sometimes a few days, sometimes months, and in that one episode it's 14 years.

305
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:29,339
What's cool about that is it's much more epic and responsive and you get a real sense of scope out of the story.

306
00:27:29,899 --> 00:27:31,040
The challenge is the logic.

307
00:27:32,615 --> 00:27:36,118
because we see parts of the future before we get to parts of the past.

308
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:40,140
So we can't, for instance, conditionally kill a character that we know is going to turn up later.

309
00:27:40,401 --> 00:27:42,682
We have to know what we can affect and when we can affect it.

310
00:27:44,564 --> 00:27:51,448
So let's look at how a story tree can shape up, factoring in everything we've talked about so far, including this time dynamic.

311
00:27:54,190 --> 00:28:01,856
So, okay, Chapter 6 starts in 2012, in the future, as it were, with Zoe, who was a kid at the motel, and now she's a 20-year-old woman.

312
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:04,611
And we know she's tormented by her past.

313
00:28:04,851 --> 00:28:06,032
We set that up in the episode.

314
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:11,034
And she's paranoid about a mysterious something that we don't yet understand in the present day.

315
00:28:11,115 --> 00:28:12,916
She's got some problem.

316
00:28:14,496 --> 00:28:21,040
And like we said earlier, she has multiple substates, depending on things that happened earlier, whether her parents are alive or dead, and so on.

317
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,362
But essentially, she's a young woman dealing with years of varied trauma.

318
00:28:25,903 --> 00:28:28,684
So we tell a bit of that story, and then we cut back to 1998.

319
00:28:28,924 --> 00:28:29,805
And now we're with Jay again.

320
00:28:30,729 --> 00:28:31,710
And it's late in his story.

321
00:28:31,750 --> 00:28:32,351
He's on the run.

322
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:33,332
He's trying to get to Canada.

323
00:28:33,632 --> 00:28:35,995
It's that scene from the blue story matrix.

324
00:28:37,216 --> 00:28:41,821
And this is basically just a visual version of that without the fifth case, two by two matrix.

325
00:28:42,162 --> 00:28:43,724
He's got those two main variables in play.

326
00:28:43,924 --> 00:28:45,506
He's either pursued by the cops or not.

327
00:28:46,186 --> 00:28:48,509
And he's either with Vanessa or he's alone.

328
00:28:50,526 --> 00:28:58,949
Now, cutting back to 2012 again, at the end of a subplot between Zoe and her grandfather, we discover that Zoe has been receiving letters from Jay.

329
00:28:59,549 --> 00:29:01,550
And she's been hiding them in a box up on a shelf.

330
00:29:02,711 --> 00:29:03,491
And we see the letter.

331
00:29:03,611 --> 00:29:11,454
And the letter is worded in such a way that we know Jay must survive his story to be able to send it, but not whether he'll escape or get caught.

332
00:29:11,894 --> 00:29:14,795
We can't reveal that yet, because the player hasn't determined it yet.

333
00:29:17,577 --> 00:29:22,578
So back in 98, we have the climactic scene of Jay approaching the Canadian border over the mountains.

334
00:29:23,239 --> 00:29:25,919
And again, that part of the scene is really modular.

335
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:27,940
There were four ways up the mountain.

336
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:33,201
There are three or four totally different kind of climactic scenes based on different variables.

337
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:35,962
There's multiple outcomes for what happens to Vanessa.

338
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:43,864
And ultimately, it all funnels into this one key variable for Jay, which is, does he get caught or does he jump to freedom?

339
00:29:46,775 --> 00:29:50,497
So now, back in 2012, this is where that's all finally going to come together and all pays off.

340
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:58,442
We learn that the reason Zoe has been struggling in recent days is because she's been debating whether to go see Jay face-to-face.

341
00:29:59,663 --> 00:30:04,526
And for the final scene, they have this long-fated encounter, one-on-one meeting together.

342
00:30:04,886 --> 00:30:09,209
But the nature of it is radically different, depending on what happened in the previous scene from 1998.

343
00:30:12,651 --> 00:30:17,436
If Jay escaped to Canada, Zoe's visiting him at his hidden cabin in the Canadian wilderness.

344
00:30:18,478 --> 00:30:23,283
The central question of the scene is, does she agree with his feeling that he didn't deserve his freedom?

345
00:30:24,084 --> 00:30:28,329
Now players decide that, and it leads to multiple endings for Jay and Zoe.

346
00:30:28,729 --> 00:30:33,134
They can reconcile, or she can finally turn him into the authorities, and so on and so forth.

347
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:39,021
But if Jay was captured, then the 2012 scene is very different.

348
00:30:39,501 --> 00:30:43,382
Zoe is visiting him on Death Row in Arizona prior to his execution.

349
00:30:44,502 --> 00:30:51,623
And the final question now is, in light of everything that's happened, will she be the friend he needs and be there for him on the day of his death?

350
00:30:53,204 --> 00:30:59,245
Players again decide that, which leads to further endings for Jay, either redeeming him, condemning him, and so on.

351
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:05,448
And that's about our maximum branching complexity, by the way.

352
00:31:06,209 --> 00:31:08,551
So there's two major branches times two variables.

353
00:31:09,091 --> 00:31:11,933
Each with a crossroads choice leads to roughly eight to 10 outcomes.

354
00:31:12,093 --> 00:31:14,735
It sounds like the same structure from the other scene we talked about.

355
00:31:14,755 --> 00:31:17,196
That's because that's kind of a natural limit for us.

356
00:31:17,296 --> 00:31:22,520
We find that if we get much more subdivided than that, what you've got is complexity for the sake of complexity.

357
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:23,901
Players don't feel it.

358
00:31:24,081 --> 00:31:25,642
It's kind of not worth doing it.

359
00:31:26,303 --> 00:31:28,184
So that's typically where we cap it.

360
00:31:29,716 --> 00:31:35,838
And part of why that's true is because of principle number five, which is no game overs or bad branches.

361
00:31:36,278 --> 00:31:42,361
That any branch we make, any story we tell, we're committed to making it feel like that's the best branch you could have gotten.

362
00:31:42,901 --> 00:31:45,342
Again, this is like a prestige TV experience.

363
00:31:45,602 --> 00:31:49,143
You want all playthroughs to feel like a great piece of content.

364
00:31:50,834 --> 00:31:52,195
Now, not all games take that approach.

365
00:31:52,716 --> 00:31:57,660
In, like, The Walking Dead, the zombies can get you, you die, and that makes sense for that IP, right?

366
00:31:58,620 --> 00:32:03,905
Or in Hidden Agenda from Supermassive, it's possible to finish that game without ever solving the mystery.

367
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:05,886
And again, that's kind of by design.

368
00:32:06,787 --> 00:32:14,213
Or in some of the Netflix shows, including ones I've worked on, you can just pick the wrong path and fail, and it tells you you have to rewind and try again or else you turn off your TV.

369
00:32:14,313 --> 00:32:14,953
Those are your options.

370
00:32:16,194 --> 00:32:17,676
But our model was Prestige TV.

371
00:32:18,176 --> 00:32:20,318
And there's no Prestige show where this happens.

372
00:32:22,423 --> 00:32:23,804
So for us, the show always goes on.

373
00:32:24,884 --> 00:32:28,786
If you fail a QTE or you make a terrible choice, there will be a consequence.

374
00:32:29,066 --> 00:32:31,667
But that consequence doesn't affect the format of your experience.

375
00:32:32,187 --> 00:32:33,368
It just changes the story.

376
00:32:35,809 --> 00:32:39,070
So early in the game, we're more forgiving about what that means.

377
00:32:39,690 --> 00:32:45,993
The most damage you can do in episode one, for instance, is you get a sheriff's deputy killed when he swings by for a seven.

378
00:32:46,253 --> 00:32:48,574
Make it sound like it's not a big deal, but poor guy, right?

379
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:54,579
But once we get to episode two, choices start leaving a more permanent mark on the game.

380
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:59,601
And from there forward, major characters can die in almost every episode.

381
00:32:59,621 --> 00:33:02,102
And when that happens, the story has to adapt.

382
00:33:03,662 --> 00:33:09,464
Partly, we do that with an ensemble cast, like I talked about, like allowing the POV character to swap over.

383
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:14,666
Partly, it's just how we structure the episode when we allow consequences to happen.

384
00:33:15,762 --> 00:33:17,563
But it's not trickery.

385
00:33:17,943 --> 00:33:20,365
We don't write a dead character out of the story.

386
00:33:20,705 --> 00:33:24,887
The fact of their death becomes a defining theme for the survivors and the people who love them.

387
00:33:24,947 --> 00:33:26,848
And that story just kind of adapts from there.

388
00:33:29,290 --> 00:33:34,773
Now, not every major event is life or death either, by the way, especially in a game like this.

389
00:33:35,453 --> 00:33:36,614
Again, maybe in The Walking Dead.

390
00:33:36,674 --> 00:33:40,756
But at a couple points in the middle of the game, it's possible for Jay to get arrested.

391
00:33:41,889 --> 00:33:43,211
and his journey doesn't end there.

392
00:33:43,632 --> 00:33:44,633
That wouldn't have felt good.

393
00:33:44,653 --> 00:33:46,236
It would just feel like a bad branch.

394
00:33:47,157 --> 00:33:50,723
And we also didn't want to tell a story from inside the prison system for three episodes.

395
00:33:50,763 --> 00:33:52,826
We could have, but it wasn't the story we wanted to tell.

396
00:33:53,630 --> 00:33:59,535
So we needed a way to adapt the story to be responsive to what happens without tying our hands creatively.

397
00:34:00,655 --> 00:34:04,719
And we knew Jay would have to escape custody, so we didn't focus the agency on that.

398
00:34:04,759 --> 00:34:08,341
It's not about what clever way do you get out of the office, because ultimately it wouldn't have mattered.

399
00:34:08,401 --> 00:34:09,122
He always escapes.

400
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:12,805
So instead, it's about what happens during that arrest.

401
00:34:15,107 --> 00:34:23,173
And there's this conditional scene that plays out where he's being interrogated by an FBI agent pretending to be on his side, played by the wonderful Brian Bovell.

402
00:34:24,434 --> 00:34:31,216
And whether players figure out that he's kind of playing him when he's not on their side determines whether Jay sort of confesses on tape.

403
00:34:32,376 --> 00:34:33,016
Let's watch it.

404
00:34:34,636 --> 00:34:35,657
My son's a linebacker.

405
00:34:36,637 --> 00:34:38,557
Got himself a full ride to ASU.

406
00:34:40,338 --> 00:34:41,138
Do you like football?

407
00:34:43,358 --> 00:34:43,859
Not really.

408
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:45,559
Well, he does.

409
00:34:46,519 --> 00:34:48,960
He's out there pursuing his dreams.

410
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,380
That's what I want for you, too, son.

411
00:34:52,641 --> 00:34:54,121
But here's the problem.

412
00:34:55,222 --> 00:34:57,164
Forensics has you at the sheriff's house.

413
00:34:58,024 --> 00:34:59,485
Witnesses have you at the motel.

414
00:35:00,506 --> 00:35:05,850
To get a deal, a way out, you need to give up something the DA doesn't already know.

415
00:35:07,071 --> 00:35:11,695
There's only one thing big enough, and that's who made you do what you did that night.

416
00:35:13,076 --> 00:35:16,699
See, we had a lot of bodies inside that motel.

417
00:35:17,499 --> 00:35:19,401
Four police officers dead at the scene.

418
00:35:20,322 --> 00:35:22,163
Another two on life support.

419
00:35:22,864 --> 00:35:24,165
You weren't just a witness.

420
00:35:25,376 --> 00:35:26,177
You were part of it.

421
00:35:26,697 --> 00:35:29,460
So tell me, who put you up to it?

422
00:35:39,691 --> 00:35:40,091
Tyler.

423
00:35:41,212 --> 00:35:42,033
He gave the orders.

424
00:35:43,335 --> 00:35:44,396
I just did what he said.

425
00:35:51,823 --> 00:35:52,323
Make a note.

426
00:35:52,844 --> 00:35:56,466
Suspect has confessed to multiple murders at the Desert Dream Motel.

427
00:36:00,288 --> 00:36:02,989
And to being an accessory in the murder of Victor Gray.

428
00:36:04,210 --> 00:36:04,450
Wait.

429
00:36:05,050 --> 00:36:08,512
That's not what I... You can discuss the finer points with the judge.

430
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:11,154
You said... You said you'd help me.

431
00:36:11,754 --> 00:36:12,755
I am helping you.

432
00:36:13,615 --> 00:36:14,856
You're gonna feel a lot better now.

433
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,737
What about pursuing my dreams?

434
00:36:17,578 --> 00:36:18,238
Like your son?

435
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:19,819
That isn't my son.

436
00:36:21,195 --> 00:36:22,556
This isn't even my office.

437
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:28,980
Yeah.

438
00:36:30,101 --> 00:36:32,602
So Jay's always going to escape this room.

439
00:36:33,263 --> 00:36:35,364
But that confession variable gets stored.

440
00:36:36,124 --> 00:36:41,208
And much later, if he's on death row and if he didn't confess in this scene, he can't actually get a reprieve.

441
00:36:42,088 --> 00:36:43,189
So it's a small touch.

442
00:36:43,249 --> 00:36:49,573
It's just an example of how even a failure, in this case the failure of getting arrested in a different scene, can be used to tailor the narrative.

443
00:36:53,376 --> 00:36:57,358
OK, so I started the talk on the idea of trees and branches and left brains and right brains.

444
00:36:57,518 --> 00:37:01,159
And a lot of what we've covered so far has been the left brain, really, the design.

445
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:15,685
But the moment-to-moment quality of any story comes down to the writing, which means, as a writer, you have to know how to take all these branching principles and just sort of completely forget them and flatten yourself down into a single branch as you write.

446
00:37:16,906 --> 00:37:22,448
So in terms of our writing process, we used all the same tools that a writing team in television would use.

447
00:37:29,981 --> 00:37:32,522
From the beginning, we got together in TV-style writer's rooms.

448
00:37:32,702 --> 00:37:37,285
We worked out the story on boards and post-its with a lot of fidget toys.

449
00:37:39,726 --> 00:37:46,870
We created a pretty extensive story bible with characters, locations, world building, elements, which we regularly updated throughout the project.

450
00:37:48,811 --> 00:37:50,252
We also like working with character maps.

451
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:54,454
This game is about relationships between characters and between families of characters.

452
00:37:55,294 --> 00:37:59,676
And especially with the AB structure, we needed to understand how everyone was connected to each other.

453
00:38:00,257 --> 00:38:07,560
In fact, for all the branching complexity of the game, and it is complex, this character map came before any of that, before any of the branching got figured out.

454
00:38:10,882 --> 00:38:21,387
Now where it starts to get unique to this format is that we use specialized tools to outline and write in a way that lets us focus on the story while also still paying attention to the considerations of branching structure.

455
00:38:22,452 --> 00:38:26,534
We looked at a lot of branching dialogue tools before we kind of got into the meat of this.

456
00:38:27,015 --> 00:38:32,878
But we decided to go with a modified version of Microsoft Word, which sort of shocks people, especially writers, when they hear that.

457
00:38:33,318 --> 00:38:35,099
But it's actually a really customizable tool.

458
00:38:35,200 --> 00:38:36,680
It's especially good for collaboration.

459
00:38:37,861 --> 00:38:41,603
There are other custom tools out there with various strengths and weaknesses.

460
00:38:41,683 --> 00:38:44,325
I could talk about more afterward in the wrap-up if anyone's interested.

461
00:38:45,486 --> 00:38:50,512
I'd strongly recommend against trying to write in a flowchart tool like Articy, Romero, or ArcWeave.

462
00:38:50,632 --> 00:38:53,115
Those are great tools, but they're not so great for writing.

463
00:38:53,735 --> 00:38:56,999
But it's ultimately up to what works for your team and for you.

464
00:38:59,568 --> 00:39:00,889
And then it's just about writing pages.

465
00:39:01,590 --> 00:39:07,595
I think our final script was about 1,200 pages long, writing them and trying to make them as good as possible.

466
00:39:08,235 --> 00:39:23,448
And the thing with the writing is it's just this tricky balance where you need to bring in all the skills you have as a screenwriter, focusing on character and emotional authenticity and the flow of the scene, and write as if there's only one branch, the branch that you're in at the moment that you're writing it.

467
00:39:24,269 --> 00:39:41,998
while at the same time remembering that moments can sort of weave in and out of each other in a very non-linear and tricky way in this format, and that there's things like feeders and choice responses and moments where the dialogue dovetails back to mainline, which do have special status within the screenplay, and they have to be written with the tree in mind.

468
00:39:44,219 --> 00:39:47,201
Which is why it's really a cross-brain exercise, bringing it back to this image.

469
00:39:48,129 --> 00:39:50,310
Some writers work with a separate narrative designer.

470
00:39:50,350 --> 00:39:53,152
Some studios are set up for writers to work with a separate narrative designer.

471
00:39:53,692 --> 00:39:55,073
And they communicate back and forth a lot.

472
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:56,494
They have to work very closely together.

473
00:39:57,215 --> 00:40:02,278
Otherwise, you just have to get very good at moving back and forth across your own corpus callosum and kind of doing both.

474
00:40:03,778 --> 00:40:07,201
But in either case, this is where I'd say the two sides of the process really collide.

475
00:40:07,381 --> 00:40:12,904
It's all about this weirdly zen idea of having to remember the tree and forget the tree at the same time.

476
00:40:15,799 --> 00:40:18,242
And then even when we think we're done, we're definitely not done.

477
00:40:18,542 --> 00:40:24,268
We went through multiple rounds of UR feedback on this game, and sometimes they radically changed the story, too.

478
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:32,396
For a long time, Vanessa always came with Jay at the end of into Chapter 6 in one of three different emotional states.

479
00:40:32,817 --> 00:40:37,922
But we got feedback that some people wanted to leave her behind in Chapter 5 for her own sake.

480
00:40:38,843 --> 00:40:39,944
So we got into the truth of that.

481
00:40:41,064 --> 00:40:41,944
It was a good note.

482
00:40:42,525 --> 00:40:50,088
And we came up with a pretty last minute storyline for what happens if Jay is approaching the border by himself and without the cops on his tail.

483
00:40:50,108 --> 00:40:52,068
Because prior to that, that was the source of the drama.

484
00:40:52,108 --> 00:40:53,809
So we had to kind of figure out something else.

485
00:40:55,790 --> 00:41:05,734
Which is how we ended up at this character of the park ranger that Jay meets, who's sort of like a much older version of himself, like a reflection of who he could become if he goes the right way in his journey.

486
00:41:06,594 --> 00:41:09,116
I'll just play you one last snippet here so we can see it.

487
00:41:11,178 --> 00:41:14,640
You know, I've seen a lot of crazy things up here.

488
00:41:15,621 --> 00:41:17,843
Forest fires, avalanches.

489
00:41:19,224 --> 00:41:24,508
But I always wondered, is it really necessary that we carry these?

490
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:29,031
But we are border patrol.

491
00:41:30,753 --> 00:41:34,936
In the rare event some criminal makes a run for it, we need to be prepared.

492
00:41:40,905 --> 00:41:55,130
Look, you seem like a nice kid, but we got a stolen car down at the trailhead, which State PD says belongs to an 18-year-old who shot up a motel in Arizona, and was last seen headed north.

493
00:41:57,331 --> 00:42:05,974
Now, you got no water bottle, no headlamp, and I sure didn't see a campsite further down the trail.

494
00:42:07,215 --> 00:42:10,276
So, what's the deal here?

495
00:42:11,277 --> 00:42:11,617
Michael?

496
00:42:18,503 --> 00:42:20,464
Please, let me keep hiking.

497
00:42:21,325 --> 00:42:22,005
Oh, son.

498
00:42:23,086 --> 00:42:24,187
I can't do that.

499
00:42:25,328 --> 00:42:26,769
I've got a responsibility.

500
00:42:28,511 --> 00:42:29,371
Can't you just help me?

501
00:42:31,293 --> 00:42:33,995
Look, it's no kind of life running from the law.

502
00:42:35,096 --> 00:42:37,598
You'll be living with that shadow over you forever.

503
00:42:38,254 --> 00:42:39,674
Let me take you down the hill.

504
00:42:40,814 --> 00:42:44,295
I've never once fired this thing, and I sure don't want to start now.

505
00:42:46,855 --> 00:42:51,436
So I'm going to let it hang there.

506
00:42:51,476 --> 00:42:53,097
But out of curiosity, who would have surrendered?

507
00:42:57,217 --> 00:42:57,477
Nice.

508
00:42:57,777 --> 00:42:58,177
And run.

509
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:00,298
Interesting.

510
00:43:02,498 --> 00:43:04,578
So yeah, that was a scene born out of necessity.

511
00:43:04,618 --> 00:43:07,499
But in the end, it gave us a really nice piece of character-based storytelling.

512
00:43:10,862 --> 00:43:15,145
So, let's get back to why all of this matters, why any of it matters.

513
00:43:21,709 --> 00:43:30,735
So, branching narrative games, they let us tell these, like, fractalized, multiversal stories that are both emotionally deep and approachable, where players have a major role in shaping the journey.

514
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:39,440
This is one of the insight screens from our game, which sort of collates the player's choices and play style into a personality assessment.

515
00:43:39,997 --> 00:43:45,981
I show it because these games can also reveal something about players in a way that linear TV can't do.

516
00:43:46,501 --> 00:43:47,582
They're a kind of mirror.

517
00:43:47,702 --> 00:43:53,085
They show us what we value and how we respond under pressure and how we differ from other people in that regard.

518
00:43:55,407 --> 00:43:56,408
I mentioned multiplayer.

519
00:43:57,549 --> 00:44:00,711
At Interior Night, we do believe these experiences can be shared.

520
00:44:00,811 --> 00:44:04,774
And a big part of the game was seeing how people respond to these problems as a group.

521
00:44:05,134 --> 00:44:08,677
You can actually play with up to eight people locally, and there's a network mode, too.

522
00:44:09,498 --> 00:44:15,482
This is an area where the design team really pushed the medium and tried to figure out how we could offer something brand new and different for players.

523
00:44:18,504 --> 00:44:22,087
Now, another reason why this all matters is what the future of content looks like.

524
00:44:23,291 --> 00:44:27,154
We've seen explosions of original prestige shows across the streaming services.

525
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:29,756
I mean, we've seen the streaming services themselves explode too, of course.

526
00:44:30,817 --> 00:44:35,321
And those same streamers are now getting more and more involved in funding and distributing games.

527
00:44:35,581 --> 00:44:36,802
It's all kind of converging.

528
00:44:38,263 --> 00:44:49,553
And pretty much every game IP is now considered a possible transmedia property from almost the second it comes into being, which all points to a future where really good stories told in unusual ways will have an audience.

529
00:44:51,991 --> 00:44:55,273
And like I said, branching stories aren't just a niche or a moment.

530
00:44:55,633 --> 00:44:58,954
They're another type of entertainment, and that factors into the publishing equation.

531
00:45:00,015 --> 00:45:07,799
So there's a lot of opportunity out there if we take the medium seriously and let it really be about that creative bar, which has been our take on it.

532
00:45:08,379 --> 00:45:14,202
So as designers, we do that by learning to see the tree, the multiverse, by being everything everywhere all at once.

533
00:45:16,247 --> 00:45:24,491
Well, as writers, we have to be completely in the moment and in the truth of the characters, because that's where a great story comes from, and that's what ultimately makes your audience care.

534
00:45:25,932 --> 00:45:27,252
So, thank you very much.

535
00:45:27,713 --> 00:45:30,454
I think we have time, so let's open it up to questions.

536
00:45:41,673 --> 00:45:45,276
Hey, I have like a million questions, but I'll try to just pick one.

537
00:45:46,257 --> 00:45:55,664
On a practical level, when you have so many different states and so many different scenes, how do you keep the entire team engaged with this multiverse?

538
00:45:55,784 --> 00:46:04,291
Whereas the writer can have the multiverse living in their head, but the rest of the team, they're building individual scenes.

539
00:46:04,351 --> 00:46:07,413
So how do you make sure that everyone is

540
00:46:08,493 --> 00:46:14,177
aimed at the right vision for a given scene amongst, you know, 14 other options.

541
00:46:15,218 --> 00:46:17,700
Yeah, so I'm going to repeat the questions for the camera.

542
00:46:17,820 --> 00:46:23,424
The question is how do you kind of keep the whole team kind of in the vision of the branching game, because it's quite complex.

543
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:28,648
And it's true that as writers we have more of that in our head, like as designers.

544
00:46:29,789 --> 00:46:32,371
I'd say that for us a big part of that is that we have a pretty small team.

545
00:46:32,951 --> 00:46:33,011
I'm

546
00:46:48,527 --> 00:46:52,410
We work in Word, but then we also use Articy.

547
00:46:52,450 --> 00:46:56,953
So there's a visual representation of the game for design and production teams.

548
00:46:57,713 --> 00:46:59,294
And we also do things like table reads.

549
00:46:59,394 --> 00:47:02,677
We continually work with the team on it.

550
00:47:02,737 --> 00:47:05,919
So the short answer, I think, is that we do it by doing it.

551
00:47:06,359 --> 00:47:07,160
It has to happen.

552
00:47:07,460 --> 00:47:08,441
Everyone needs to be in the loop.

553
00:47:09,540 --> 00:47:18,415
If someone doesn't know what's going on, they're going to get on Slack and ask a question or talk to their director or something and kind of make sure they have that knowledge.

554
00:47:19,457 --> 00:47:19,657
Great.

555
00:47:19,898 --> 00:47:20,298
Great talk.

556
00:47:20,338 --> 00:47:20,639
Thank you.

557
00:47:20,819 --> 00:47:21,060
Thank you.

558
00:47:22,798 --> 00:47:24,819
Hello, thank you for an amazing talk.

559
00:47:25,679 --> 00:47:33,100
I'm super interested, because you mentioned that you wouldn't recommend using RTC as a tool for writing, right?

560
00:47:33,821 --> 00:47:39,802
And we actually did that on a game called Game Deck, which also involved a lot of branching narrative.

561
00:47:40,182 --> 00:47:42,222
And we also weren't happy with it.

562
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:48,944
So I would be super interested to learn a little bit more about your writing pipeline, because you mentioned that you

563
00:47:50,315 --> 00:47:54,259
approach writing as a normal screenplay writing, right?

564
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:58,422
So how does that pipeline of writing and then using RDC work at your company?

565
00:47:58,862 --> 00:47:59,683
Yeah, it's tricky.

566
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:08,911
I mean, it's first worth saying that we developed our format having previously worked in proprietary branching tools.

567
00:48:09,031 --> 00:48:12,253
Like we all came from different companies that did this type of thing.

568
00:48:12,273 --> 00:48:16,637
So there was already some internal knowledge on like what we would need to do in a

569
00:48:17,097 --> 00:48:18,378
in a Microsoft Word format.

570
00:48:18,758 --> 00:48:20,679
It could be very complicated otherwise.

571
00:48:20,719 --> 00:48:23,821
So we figured out how to organize it in Word.

572
00:48:23,941 --> 00:48:34,488
And then it's definitely a pain point for us getting into Articy, and especially with revision and iteration, because those tools don't speak that well together.

573
00:48:35,068 --> 00:48:39,991
If we make a change, there needs to be this kind of manual update process, and it's something we've been looking at.

574
00:48:40,351 --> 00:48:40,451
talk

575
00:48:54,798 --> 00:48:54,938
here.

576
00:49:13,510 --> 00:49:18,076
And it's something that we're also exploring tools and trying to figure out how we want to improve that.

577
00:49:18,196 --> 00:49:24,704
But having people there to navigate that bridge was just a big piece of that for us, and it let us kind of get the creative.

578
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,566
We'd love a speech on that someday.

579
00:49:26,867 --> 00:49:27,287
Interesting.

580
00:49:27,427 --> 00:49:27,628
OK.

581
00:49:28,168 --> 00:49:28,529
Note taken.

582
00:49:30,489 --> 00:49:30,769
Hello.

583
00:49:31,270 --> 00:49:32,511
Thank you for the excellent talk.

584
00:49:32,971 --> 00:49:52,549
I'm curious, for people who are looking to do smaller, maybe solo branching narratives, or just who wouldn't be working in a team, how would you recommend estimating the scope that you can feasibly accomplish?

585
00:49:52,850 --> 00:49:54,831
And kind of following on the last question,

586
00:49:57,134 --> 00:49:59,936
What software would you recommend when you're not writing across a team?

587
00:49:59,976 --> 00:50:04,560
I assume proprietary software is easier to use in that circumstance, but I'm not actually sure.

588
00:50:04,721 --> 00:50:05,581
Something like Twine?

589
00:50:06,662 --> 00:50:08,364
Yeah, so let me repeat the question.

590
00:50:08,384 --> 00:50:09,405
I forgot to do that on this one.

591
00:50:09,945 --> 00:50:14,029
So it's about firstly managing scope on a solo project.

592
00:50:14,089 --> 00:50:21,316
And I wanted to just ask, when you say manage scope, do you mean for yourself as a writer, or do you mean like the complexity going into production from the script?

593
00:50:22,391 --> 00:50:38,518
I'd say just like the complexity of the actual script, like how much can I, like if I'm writing my own branching narrative and it's just me, how do you do a reality check on like this is how much I can feasibly accomplish as one person?

594
00:50:39,538 --> 00:50:46,681
Yeah, I mean, so on the writing side that's going to come down to how, I don't know, how prolific you are I guess, you know, I mean,

595
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:49,198
be ambitious

596
00:51:10,399 --> 00:51:13,686
So yeah, you kind of just have to, I think, try it a bit.

597
00:51:14,407 --> 00:51:19,077
The other side of that question, which is what can you produce, I think is a whole other matter.

598
00:51:21,280 --> 00:51:23,162
It's useful to know what your ratio is.

599
00:51:24,703 --> 00:51:32,429
There's usually a ratio of how much material you've written versus what a playthrough is.

600
00:51:33,330 --> 00:51:39,675
These games are often something like 2 to 1 or 3 to 1 in terms of how much gets produced versus how much gets seen by the player.

601
00:51:39,955 --> 00:51:42,197
There's a whole bunch of different ways to look at that.

602
00:51:43,561 --> 00:51:46,562
Yeah, budget's going to factor into that, and time.

603
00:51:46,582 --> 00:51:52,303
If you're doing it on your own time, maybe you want to take bite-sized chunks and make sure you can accomplish something.

604
00:51:52,763 --> 00:52:00,225
Versus if you're out to be the Brandon Sanderson of game writing, and you've got 15 volumes in you or something, then more power to you.

605
00:52:01,585 --> 00:52:06,486
And then what sort of software would you recommend for an independent?

606
00:52:07,186 --> 00:52:09,027
Yeah, software for independent.

607
00:52:10,982 --> 00:52:13,003
I'm probably not the best person to answer that.

608
00:52:13,023 --> 00:52:14,104
I know people use Twine.

609
00:52:15,964 --> 00:52:20,246
But are you talking cinematic or interactive fiction?

610
00:52:20,707 --> 00:52:21,507
Interactive fiction.

611
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:21,887
Yeah.

612
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:28,590
I mean, I think Twine's what they use, but there's probably other people who know that better because we're very specifically focused on cinematic.

613
00:52:29,571 --> 00:52:31,572
So it's very much like screenplay style for us.

614
00:52:31,872 --> 00:52:34,213
But we could chat about it more in the wrap-up area after if you like.

615
00:52:34,653 --> 00:52:34,873
OK.

616
00:52:34,993 --> 00:52:35,394
Sounds great.

617
00:52:35,434 --> 00:52:35,734
Thank you.

618
00:52:35,894 --> 00:52:36,134
Thank you.

619
00:52:37,170 --> 00:52:37,851
Hey Brad, great talk.

620
00:52:38,951 --> 00:52:39,872
I got two questions for you.

621
00:52:40,472 --> 00:52:49,879
As you were in the midst of pre-production and production, how often did you play test as a team and have to go back to the story bible and realize, oh we need to refine this or flesh out this detail.

622
00:52:50,699 --> 00:52:54,442
How often did your team review the story as it was developing?

623
00:52:55,239 --> 00:52:57,861
Yeah, well the team is constantly in the game.

624
00:52:58,622 --> 00:53:03,466
How often the writing team saw the game, I think that the answer to that is we need to do more of it.

625
00:53:03,866 --> 00:53:14,634
We were, you know, there was a lot of exploration and experimentation and figuring out the, you know, we have a unique art style and understanding how that was going to work in the format was a long process.

626
00:53:14,695 --> 00:53:22,741
And so there was a period where it was like better for the team to kind of work that out without us being like, you're not

627
00:53:22,901 --> 00:53:26,342
You know, facial expression doesn't, you know, there's a lot that we could have, like, been obstructive on.

628
00:53:27,722 --> 00:53:39,065
As we got further along, we played it more, and I think that we definitely, it's something we've talked about, we want to keep increasing that, because you, there's, like, the, it's super valuable to always be playing the game.

629
00:53:40,006 --> 00:53:46,167
It's just about knowing when your notes are useful, because, like, there's a point at which the cinematics are just bad.

630
00:53:46,307 --> 00:53:52,229
Like, it's just their first pass, and everyone knows it, and the last thing you need is a writer coming in and being like, I feel like you're not accomplishing my,

631
00:53:52,769 --> 00:53:58,296
Did you notice any sort of communication tools or strategies that really helped working between the narrative and the other disciplines on the project?

632
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:09,060
on

633
00:54:27,998 --> 00:54:38,342
you know, just shooting a message to each other, jumping on a call, but communication always, you know, a quick call solves things better than 100 slacks, if you know what I mean.

634
00:54:38,923 --> 00:54:40,383
So that's my five minute warning.

635
00:54:40,523 --> 00:54:42,064
Yeah, okay, so one or two more questions.

636
00:54:42,813 --> 00:54:45,496
Hi, I had a question about the crossroads decision points.

637
00:54:46,697 --> 00:55:01,273
I know that in the game those decision points require player alignment, but I'm wondering, like, what was the rationale behind revealing that those were, like, major choice points to the player versus obscuring that?

638
00:55:01,413 --> 00:55:02,274
It makes me think of, like,

639
00:55:02,995 --> 00:55:14,660
In Telltale, when it's like, so-and-so will remember this, or Intel Dawn, where there's like the little butterfly, what do you think is the value of saying this is a big choice versus not letting the player know when that's occurring?

640
00:55:15,420 --> 00:55:22,123
Yeah, it's a good question about how, about why and when you make big choices transparent in these games.

641
00:55:22,683 --> 00:55:28,686
And I think there's a reason that these games all seem to land on, like you're saying, different ways of communicating it.

642
00:55:29,272 --> 00:55:29,332
at

643
00:55:52,517 --> 00:55:56,100
You play the Netflix stories and you don't see a tree.

644
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:57,481
You don't typically know.

645
00:55:58,201 --> 00:55:59,182
And that's fine.

646
00:55:59,662 --> 00:56:06,927
But I think we just feel that it's a value add for people to know that this is an important moment.

647
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:12,651
And it helps convey that certain moments are going to be impactful, and especially in a multiplayer setting.

648
00:56:13,351 --> 00:56:18,853
It adds stakes, like you just feel in the moment the tension of that, and we're all sitting there going like, oh god, what's going to happen?

649
00:56:19,913 --> 00:56:22,994
And it's also part of the maxim that choices should matter.

650
00:56:23,675 --> 00:56:26,856
We're saying your choices matter, and this choice is especially going to matter.

651
00:56:26,876 --> 00:56:30,357
We're being upfront about that, so please take your time and think about it.

652
00:56:30,417 --> 00:56:33,338
Our timer mechanic actually works differently on crossroads choices.

653
00:56:33,378 --> 00:56:40,560
They're typically untimed, because we want people to just sit and talk to each other and figure out, honestly, what's the right move here?

654
00:56:40,580 --> 00:56:41,841
Because there's going to be consequences.

655
00:56:43,362 --> 00:56:50,069
So it's a design decision, and I'm definitely interested to see a game that goes either way with it that was the one we made for this game.

656
00:56:50,969 --> 00:56:51,250
Thank you.

657
00:56:51,590 --> 00:56:51,850
Thank you.

658
00:56:52,831 --> 00:56:53,712
Do we have time for one more?

659
00:56:54,833 --> 00:56:55,053
Yeah.

660
00:56:55,454 --> 00:56:56,655
While he's looking at the time, go for it.

661
00:56:57,297 --> 00:56:58,759
Thank you for the fascinating talk.

662
00:56:59,219 --> 00:57:09,169
My question, naively, if you have a branch, every time the players make a choice, you end up with your branches doubling each choice.

663
00:57:09,249 --> 00:57:17,297
So I recognize that you need to recollect them into a limited number of branches, such as he's in Canada or he's on death row.

664
00:57:17,998 --> 00:57:25,822
However, funneling players into one of two branches might reduce the feeling of agency and make them feel railroaded.

665
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:33,045
How do you prevent combinatorial explosion while at the same time preserving players' feelings of agency?

666
00:57:33,735 --> 00:57:38,336
Yes, so the question is how do you prevent combinatorial or exponential branching and keep agency?

667
00:57:38,436 --> 00:57:45,898
And I think the brief answer is like I was talking about the 10 rule, like how we didn't go past that level of nuance.

668
00:57:45,938 --> 00:57:47,159
And it's for that reason.

669
00:57:47,659 --> 00:57:51,560
You can't go bigger than that without spending more than you want to spend on these games.

670
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,141
But if you go less, it does feel railroaded.

671
00:57:54,221 --> 00:57:56,321
So it's a balance, honestly.

672
00:57:56,602 --> 00:57:58,102
That question you're asking is kind of

673
00:57:58,462 --> 00:58:01,884
one of the central questions that we face in designing these games.

674
00:58:02,204 --> 00:58:11,868
Because like you say, you do want people to feel like their choices are mattering, but you can't do a sub-choice on a sub-choice on a sub-choice, or you quickly, you know, you really do have a tree at that point.

675
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:19,092
And maybe in the text adventure game of that, you can afford to do it if all you're spending is writing time.

676
00:58:19,492 --> 00:58:24,658
But when you're shooting, and you've got actors, and you've got voice, and you've got an art team, there's got to be production constraints.

677
00:58:25,178 --> 00:58:28,522
So that balance is a big part of the process, honestly.

678
00:58:28,562 --> 00:58:30,343
And that's kind of the art and science of it.

679
00:58:32,085 --> 00:58:33,106
And that's a good question, by the way.

680
00:58:33,126 --> 00:58:35,929
I'm happy to talk about that and other topics at the Alcove.

681
00:58:35,969 --> 00:58:37,771
I think they're going to kick us out right now.

682
00:58:40,086 --> 00:58:43,169
I just have a post-mortem question.

683
00:58:43,269 --> 00:58:56,984
Did you use telemetry to analyze how many players took which path or if there are branches which was maybe taken by really few players to learn from it to see for the next game maybe this was a bad decision or something?

684
00:58:57,324 --> 00:58:58,725
Yeah, good question about telemetry.

685
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:00,666
The answer is yes, we get telemetry.

686
00:59:01,467 --> 00:59:09,812
Before release, there's like UR feedback telemetry, so we could see what people were doing in playtests, and we did make some tweaks based on that.

687
00:59:10,133 --> 00:59:12,094
And then after the fact, we also get telemetry.

688
00:59:12,154 --> 00:59:15,596
We don't do post-launch updates or anything.

689
00:59:15,636 --> 00:59:18,678
We're not changing the balance, but we do see that stuff.

690
00:59:18,698 --> 00:59:20,620
We'll do that for the next game.

691
00:59:21,420 --> 00:59:22,561
Yeah, it's good to know.

692
00:59:22,621 --> 00:59:30,024
I think even if it's just for the pleasure of being like, oh, the choice was balanced, or whoops, everyone chose to run, whatever it is.

693
00:59:30,825 --> 00:59:34,186
But yeah, it's nice to be able to know what people are picking.

694
00:59:34,207 --> 00:59:35,107
Thank you.

695
00:59:35,687 --> 00:59:37,108
So thank you, everyone.

696
00:59:37,748 --> 00:59:41,150
I'm supposed to remind you to fill out your thingy that you're going to get emailed.

697
00:59:41,630 --> 00:59:45,192
And if you want to talk more, there's a little alcove that way.

698
00:59:45,232 --> 00:59:46,753
I'm happy to chat with people during lunch.
