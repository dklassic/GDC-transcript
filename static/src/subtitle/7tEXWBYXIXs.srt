1
00:00:11,312 --> 00:00:12,533
Thank you everyone for being here today.

2
00:00:13,094 --> 00:00:16,778
And we're going to be talking about crunch, what it is, how it happens, and things we

3
00:00:16,798 --> 00:00:19,781
can do as individuals and teams to help prevent it.

4
00:00:22,724 --> 00:00:25,705
My name is Chris Cobb, I'm the CTO for Pragma Platform,

5
00:00:26,145 --> 00:00:29,166
and I've been in games for a number of years now.

6
00:00:30,046 --> 00:00:31,807
At Pragma, we're creating a back-end game engine,

7
00:00:31,827 --> 00:00:33,387
which is basically services and tools

8
00:00:33,487 --> 00:00:35,448
to help you ship online multiplayer games.

9
00:00:36,128 --> 00:00:38,109
Our team have worked at big publishers and studios,

10
00:00:38,169 --> 00:00:39,369
as well as smaller indie shops.

11
00:00:39,949 --> 00:00:41,030
So I just want to share stories

12
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:42,610
about what we've done in the past

13
00:00:42,890 --> 00:00:44,190
to create a sustainable work environment,

14
00:00:45,351 --> 00:00:48,452
and do that while doing what we love,

15
00:00:48,572 --> 00:00:49,732
which is shipping games.

16
00:00:51,202 --> 00:00:52,942
This talk's for anyone who works in games,

17
00:00:52,962 --> 00:00:54,463
whether you're leading a studio or a team,

18
00:00:54,643 --> 00:00:56,124
or you're leading from the front,

19
00:00:56,244 --> 00:00:58,024
you know, as an individual contributor,

20
00:00:58,284 --> 00:01:02,346
which is where I've spent most of my time in the industry.

21
00:01:02,946 --> 00:01:05,607
Before we begin, I just want to give a very special thank you

22
00:01:05,647 --> 00:01:06,268
to Hannah Zolty.

23
00:01:06,488 --> 00:01:08,208
Hannah's our lead tech writer,

24
00:01:08,688 --> 00:01:11,249
and she did a bunch of work tirelessly

25
00:01:11,270 --> 00:01:13,250
to help prepare this talk, so thank you, Hannah.

26
00:01:16,735 --> 00:01:19,937
Alright, so for our agenda this afternoon,

27
00:01:20,377 --> 00:01:22,138
we're just gonna do quick definitions

28
00:01:22,238 --> 00:01:23,859
and cover some distinctions about the ways

29
00:01:23,899 --> 00:01:27,221
that crunch can happen, kind of some of the different causes.

30
00:01:29,002 --> 00:01:30,543
We're gonna do a bit of a case study,

31
00:01:30,583 --> 00:01:32,904
talk about a large project that I worked on at a big studio

32
00:01:32,984 --> 00:01:34,906
and kind of the personal experiences I had there,

33
00:01:34,986 --> 00:01:35,886
the good times, the bad,

34
00:01:36,406 --> 00:01:37,507
and what we can kind of take out of that.

35
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,512
And I do want to say, like, I think that this is possible.

36
00:01:42,252 --> 00:01:43,754
It's something that I've lived and experienced

37
00:01:43,774 --> 00:01:45,515
and I think it's really valuable.

38
00:01:45,535 --> 00:01:46,475
So I'm going to talk a little bit about

39
00:01:46,495 --> 00:01:48,177
what we're doing at Pragma in terms of our culture

40
00:01:48,437 --> 00:01:50,058
to try to embed this into how we work every day.

41
00:01:54,041 --> 00:01:55,922
Before we dive in, I just want to say, you know,

42
00:01:56,423 --> 00:01:57,784
first, summarize our goal,

43
00:01:58,424 --> 00:02:00,385
or at least what our goal should be in games,

44
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:02,647
which is, you know, ship something that's delightful

45
00:02:02,687 --> 00:02:05,109
and amazing to players that we're proud of as a team

46
00:02:05,949 --> 00:02:07,150
in a sustainable and healthy way.

47
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:11,791
And we have to work on purpose to prevent crunch

48
00:02:11,931 --> 00:02:13,412
because it's not enough to just observe

49
00:02:13,452 --> 00:02:16,013
this is a problem in our industry and hope for the best.

50
00:02:16,753 --> 00:02:18,894
So two things I specifically hope you can take away today

51
00:02:18,914 --> 00:02:22,415
are that it takes hard work to create a healthy culture.

52
00:02:22,536 --> 00:02:23,936
This does not come for free at all.

53
00:02:24,636 --> 00:02:27,097
There's a book called The Advantage by Pat Lencioni

54
00:02:27,798 --> 00:02:29,918
and he talks about investing first in your culture

55
00:02:29,998 --> 00:02:30,879
and putting your priority there,

56
00:02:30,919 --> 00:02:32,099
especially as a leadership team

57
00:02:32,699 --> 00:02:34,380
and understanding that the rest will follow.

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,381
And it's possible, you can do it.

59
00:02:39,363 --> 00:02:41,524
I do want to say up front, I don't think I have all the answers.

60
00:02:43,004 --> 00:02:43,905
I don't want to pretend to.

61
00:02:44,525 --> 00:02:48,066
And I understand that I've benefited from privilege, and I know that not everyone's

62
00:02:48,106 --> 00:02:49,027
situation is the same.

63
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:53,269
This is not an easy topic, and I don't want to send a message that says otherwise.

64
00:02:54,289 --> 00:02:58,091
I do want to acknowledge that at the outset, and appreciate that we all have a unique circumstance.

65
00:02:59,807 --> 00:03:00,988
I also want to say that it matters.

66
00:03:01,429 --> 00:03:01,969
It's important.

67
00:03:02,510 --> 00:03:05,092
And I don't feel necessarily qualified to talk about this,

68
00:03:05,152 --> 00:03:06,313
but at the same time I think it's important

69
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:07,694
that we start having these conversations.

70
00:03:08,575 --> 00:03:09,896
And so we're gonna talk about it today.

71
00:03:10,496 --> 00:03:13,819
What we can do as a community and an industry.

72
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:15,220
So that's why we're here.

73
00:03:18,143 --> 00:03:19,604
All right, so at its most basic,

74
00:03:20,224 --> 00:03:21,926
we might say that in order to hit a deadline,

75
00:03:22,226 --> 00:03:24,368
developers are required to work beyond the limits

76
00:03:24,688 --> 00:03:25,969
of what's healthy or sustainable.

77
00:03:26,897 --> 00:03:29,717
People are risking their health and well-being to hit a deadline or date.

78
00:03:31,258 --> 00:03:33,579
And we're going to kind of explore two main causes.

79
00:03:33,939 --> 00:03:36,199
So we've got overt crunch mandated by leadership.

80
00:03:36,219 --> 00:03:38,520
I think that's the thing we end up talking about a lot.

81
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:40,681
But I also want to talk about accidental crunch.

82
00:03:41,201 --> 00:03:43,021
It's a little bit harder to define, but I'm talking about

83
00:03:43,522 --> 00:03:46,743
when well-intentioned folks adopt unhealthy behaviors,

84
00:03:47,163 --> 00:03:50,344
whether that's from misguided ideals around passion or commitment levels,

85
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:53,805
or frankly, sometimes it's irresponsible management and leadership.

86
00:03:54,947 --> 00:03:58,423
Both can be equally destructive to teams and to our health and well-being.

87
00:04:00,732 --> 00:04:03,113
So a couple years back I was having lunch with some friends.

88
00:04:03,233 --> 00:04:04,674
They all came from the same studio.

89
00:04:05,234 --> 00:04:07,294
Very famous studio, renowned for some of the best games

90
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:09,715
that we know of, but they're also renowned

91
00:04:09,735 --> 00:04:11,976
for having a pretty awful crunch culture.

92
00:04:12,056 --> 00:04:13,056
So I asked them about it and said,

93
00:04:13,076 --> 00:04:14,177
what were the dynamics there?

94
00:04:14,217 --> 00:04:16,217
Was this like mandated crunch?

95
00:04:16,237 --> 00:04:16,878
What was happening?

96
00:04:17,478 --> 00:04:19,198
And what they described was that,

97
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:21,619
as is common in traditional publishing,

98
00:04:21,679 --> 00:04:23,300
a date and budget were picked at the outset

99
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:24,520
and that thing never changed.

100
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,721
We all know that game development's super hard,

101
00:04:27,821 --> 00:04:29,762
and we're iterating and creatively trying to learn

102
00:04:29,802 --> 00:04:31,782
and adapt and discover the fun and find these things.

103
00:04:32,943 --> 00:04:35,184
But they had virtually no production process.

104
00:04:35,264 --> 00:04:37,845
There wasn't a lot of actual management going on.

105
00:04:38,245 --> 00:04:40,726
And what that meant was folks were kind of left

106
00:04:40,787 --> 00:04:42,107
to figure out on their own what to work on.

107
00:04:42,267 --> 00:04:44,228
And so I asked kind of what felt like

108
00:04:44,248 --> 00:04:45,248
an obvious follow-up question,

109
00:04:45,268 --> 00:04:47,069
which was, do you guys ever throw any work away?

110
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:48,290
And they were like, oh, all the time.

111
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:49,450
Sometimes like six months of work

112
00:04:49,470 --> 00:04:51,211
would just get torpedoed, you know,

113
00:04:51,631 --> 00:04:52,572
kind of in a drive-by.

114
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:52,972
And so,

115
00:04:54,166 --> 00:04:55,969
you know, that continued later in the project,

116
00:04:55,989 --> 00:04:58,412
the studio head might drive by at nights and weekends

117
00:04:58,572 --> 00:05:00,495
and keep track of who's in their seats and who's not.

118
00:05:01,637 --> 00:05:03,880
So, you know, the point of this,

119
00:05:04,661 --> 00:05:06,223
and ultimately broadcasting to the company

120
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,306
what the expectations were and what the commitment level

121
00:05:08,346 --> 00:05:09,608
was being required of the team.

122
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:12,641
So the point of this is that overt crunch is very real.

123
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,324
Anyone who's trying to say otherwise or dismiss it

124
00:05:15,504 --> 00:05:17,966
is, you know, needs a reality check ultimately.

125
00:05:18,386 --> 00:05:20,648
Especially if we're talking from studio heads

126
00:05:20,788 --> 00:05:21,349
and executives.

127
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,391
But I don't want to spend an hour just complaining up here.

128
00:05:24,511 --> 00:05:26,093
I don't think that's gonna help or fix anything.

129
00:05:26,613 --> 00:05:28,715
So I do want to focus on practical things

130
00:05:28,755 --> 00:05:30,356
we can do as individuals on our teams

131
00:05:30,517 --> 00:05:31,397
to help make things better.

132
00:05:32,138 --> 00:05:33,439
So we're gonna talk about the dynamics

133
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:34,960
between these different causes for crunch

134
00:05:36,021 --> 00:05:37,643
and kind of dive into that in the case study.

135
00:05:40,188 --> 00:05:42,810
One idea I do want to introduce is called win-win or no deal.

136
00:05:42,830 --> 00:05:45,491
It comes from the seven habits of highly effective people.

137
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:50,215
And our goal is to find a win-win outcome.

138
00:05:51,611 --> 00:05:53,193
The studio is happy and so are we.

139
00:05:53,613 --> 00:05:55,635
We're able to live lives as developers

140
00:05:55,675 --> 00:05:58,157
that are sustainable for us.

141
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:59,538
It's a really simple concept,

142
00:05:59,598 --> 00:06:02,160
but it is actually really powerful.

143
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:04,021
Oftentimes when we talk about compromise,

144
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:06,303
it quickly can turn into a win-lose circumstance

145
00:06:06,323 --> 00:06:08,645
where one side or the other are experiencing

146
00:06:08,665 --> 00:06:10,006
a problem of some kind.

147
00:06:10,667 --> 00:06:12,508
And I think we're all in games because we're passionate.

148
00:06:12,528 --> 00:06:14,390
We wanna make stuff, we wanna delight players.

149
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:16,872
but we have a unique circumstance,

150
00:06:17,092 --> 00:06:18,993
so I don't think there is a universal win

151
00:06:19,233 --> 00:06:20,634
that we can all define and agree on,

152
00:06:21,195 --> 00:06:23,196
but it's really critical for you individually

153
00:06:23,636 --> 00:06:24,997
to understand what it takes for you

154
00:06:25,017 --> 00:06:27,980
to be in a winning situation.

155
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,061
And the alternative is no deal.

156
00:06:31,302 --> 00:06:33,244
I don't make, mean to make this sound easy.

157
00:06:33,384 --> 00:06:36,247
I appreciate that we can't all just like rage quit our jobs

158
00:06:36,307 --> 00:06:37,749
because we're mad about what's going on.

159
00:06:38,670 --> 00:06:41,492
But at the same time, it's really important to understand

160
00:06:41,552 --> 00:06:46,297
that, you know, they're basically to find that individual

161
00:06:46,337 --> 00:06:47,939
win and really seek that out.

162
00:06:49,567 --> 00:06:51,368
This has really benefited me in my personal life.

163
00:06:51,528 --> 00:06:53,388
So to tell a quick story, my first startup

164
00:06:53,409 --> 00:06:54,489
was in educational games.

165
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:56,610
It's something I'm still very passionate about.

166
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:57,971
We didn't have a plan.

167
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:59,832
I just quit my job, gave it a go.

168
00:06:59,852 --> 00:07:01,332
I had a few friends that joined me.

169
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:04,454
And we started fundraising and received a term sheet.

170
00:07:04,774 --> 00:07:05,835
It's really exciting.

171
00:07:07,066 --> 00:07:08,567
But we started negotiating the contract,

172
00:07:09,067 --> 00:07:10,609
and it was really difficult,

173
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,030
and it became apparent that our investor

174
00:07:12,070 --> 00:07:14,471
had different incompatible needs

175
00:07:15,012 --> 00:07:17,113
between us and our team.

176
00:07:17,673 --> 00:07:20,115
And so we were struggling to find that win-win circumstance.

177
00:07:20,756 --> 00:07:23,037
For us, we wanted a certain amount of creative control

178
00:07:23,097 --> 00:07:24,358
and freedom in what we were gonna work on.

179
00:07:24,818 --> 00:07:26,459
For the investor, they wanted to protect their investment.

180
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,300
They were gonna outlay millions of dollars

181
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,880
and trust us to build something.

182
00:07:30,420 --> 00:07:33,261
But ultimately, we couldn't find a circumstance

183
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,682
in which both parties felt safe.

184
00:07:35,002 --> 00:07:36,262
And it was like the hardest thing in the world,

185
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:38,323
I promise, to walk away from the chance

186
00:07:38,383 --> 00:07:40,063
to work on something that I was so passionate about.

187
00:07:40,703 --> 00:07:42,124
But we kinda stuck to this framework

188
00:07:42,184 --> 00:07:43,284
of win-win or no deal,

189
00:07:43,304 --> 00:07:44,605
and ultimately had to step down from that.

190
00:07:45,145 --> 00:07:46,585
And there wasn't blame on either side.

191
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:48,746
It wasn't about one person being right or wrong.

192
00:07:48,766 --> 00:07:49,966
It was just that in that circumstance,

193
00:07:50,006 --> 00:07:52,087
we couldn't find a situation that worked for both of us.

194
00:07:53,219 --> 00:07:55,180
So this was one of the hardest choices I've ever made,

195
00:07:55,880 --> 00:07:58,461
but this framework has been a really useful thing

196
00:07:58,521 --> 00:07:59,481
for me to remind myself.

197
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:02,803
Like, I need to find a winning circumstance for myself

198
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:04,683
and hope that the other party can too.

199
00:08:08,285 --> 00:08:11,326
So having touched on some overt crunch ideas just briefly,

200
00:08:11,686 --> 00:08:13,207
I do want to talk about the more subtle signs

201
00:08:13,707 --> 00:08:14,407
of a crunch culture.

202
00:08:15,467 --> 00:08:17,908
First, I do want to say it can be just as destructive.

203
00:08:18,008 --> 00:08:18,809
You know, I don't want to be,

204
00:08:20,584 --> 00:08:22,685
I think the overt crunch is the one we focus a lot on,

205
00:08:22,786 --> 00:08:25,247
and I think it matters, and we need to work on that.

206
00:08:25,748 --> 00:08:27,909
But I've also seen situations in which

207
00:08:28,009 --> 00:08:29,350
it wasn't a mandate from leadership,

208
00:08:29,450 --> 00:08:31,011
but I still saw destructive behaviors

209
00:08:31,091 --> 00:08:33,493
in and around the teams I've been a part of.

210
00:08:33,553 --> 00:08:34,593
So I do want to spend time there,

211
00:08:34,613 --> 00:08:36,455
because there's a whole lot we can do individually

212
00:08:37,115 --> 00:08:38,976
to do better there.

213
00:08:40,097 --> 00:08:41,898
This idea was seeded from an experience

214
00:08:41,918 --> 00:08:42,759
I had early in my career.

215
00:08:43,705 --> 00:08:48,228
where I was working on a great team, uh, morale was high, and you know, it was early evening

216
00:08:48,308 --> 00:08:52,471
one night, engineer on the team was kinda in the zone, he was just kinda jamming away, and

217
00:08:52,712 --> 00:08:55,914
one of our colleagues, teammates came along and was like, hey man, don't burn out, you know,

218
00:08:55,954 --> 00:08:59,076
clock out, take care of yourself, and this was totally a reasonable thing to say.

219
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,443
Fast forward six months, and we started coming up

220
00:09:03,483 --> 00:09:05,464
against the deadline of this really large project.

221
00:09:06,165 --> 00:09:08,767
And that engineer was feeling pressure from the schedule.

222
00:09:08,947 --> 00:09:10,289
He started raising this in team meetings,

223
00:09:10,329 --> 00:09:11,610
like, hey, I'm really getting nervous

224
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,811
about the scope of what's happening.

225
00:09:13,251 --> 00:09:14,672
You know, he's worried about getting crunched.

226
00:09:15,413 --> 00:09:17,875
And that same colleague that had encouraged him

227
00:09:18,095 --> 00:09:20,437
to take care of himself said, hey, you know,

228
00:09:20,478 --> 00:09:21,038
don't worry about it.

229
00:09:21,418 --> 00:09:23,460
I'll just make a grocery run, I'll get snacks,

230
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:25,322
we'll load you up so that you can kind of stay here,

231
00:09:25,362 --> 00:09:26,223
heads down and focused.

232
00:09:27,063 --> 00:09:27,964
And this really struck me.

233
00:09:29,082 --> 00:09:36,889
With the best of intentions, our teammate was enabling an unhealthy choice for the team and for this person in particular.

234
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:44,817
And it raises the question, are we going to advocate for healthy decisions just during the good times, or can we do it during the difficult times as well?

235
00:09:45,657 --> 00:09:52,524
Nobody was being ill-willed in this circumstance, but it is up to us as individuals to look out for one another and take care of each other.

236
00:09:53,729 --> 00:09:57,109
And ultimately, I think that it takes some personal courage

237
00:09:57,810 --> 00:09:59,410
to speak up and say, hey, wait a minute,

238
00:09:59,490 --> 00:10:02,051
why is it that months ago we encouraged one another

239
00:10:02,071 --> 00:10:03,911
to keep balanced and stay healthy,

240
00:10:04,391 --> 00:10:05,751
but now that there's some pressure,

241
00:10:05,771 --> 00:10:08,632
we're suddenly creating enabling behaviors.

242
00:10:09,012 --> 00:10:10,293
And so that's kind of the idea

243
00:10:10,353 --> 00:10:12,253
that I do wanna spend some time exploring

244
00:10:12,593 --> 00:10:14,834
and talk about the management and leadership side

245
00:10:14,874 --> 00:10:16,114
and how do we run our teams.

246
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,420
So let's launch into the main part of the talk.

247
00:10:20,921 --> 00:10:22,581
It's a breakdown for a project I work on

248
00:10:22,722 --> 00:10:23,362
called Team Builder.

249
00:10:24,302 --> 00:10:25,763
And we're gonna talk about the tension

250
00:10:25,803 --> 00:10:27,683
between the overt and accidental pressures

251
00:10:28,003 --> 00:10:29,504
and then specific processes,

252
00:10:29,544 --> 00:10:31,165
like how this team ran and operated

253
00:10:31,345 --> 00:10:33,165
in a way that ultimately I was really proud of.

254
00:10:34,555 --> 00:10:36,235
I want to say, this word Agile has been around

255
00:10:36,275 --> 00:10:37,195
for 20 plus years.

256
00:10:37,415 --> 00:10:39,456
I think it's lost a lot of its meaning at this point.

257
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,896
And we all say, Agile's great, but you know,

258
00:10:41,936 --> 00:10:44,017
or we tried Agile, but we just moved too quickly

259
00:10:44,057 --> 00:10:44,637
to make it work.

260
00:10:44,797 --> 00:10:48,678
Or Agile is too restrictive and not flexible enough

261
00:10:48,698 --> 00:10:49,158
for our team.

262
00:10:49,478 --> 00:10:51,799
Or sometimes people say, oh, we do Agile, hard stop.

263
00:10:52,459 --> 00:10:55,179
But they're still over budget, they're still stressed,

264
00:10:55,219 --> 00:10:56,840
we're still getting crunched at the end of our project.

265
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,620
So I just want to say at the outset,

266
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,920
process should serve the team.

267
00:11:01,659 --> 00:11:02,980
not the team serving the process,

268
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,941
which means people should be thankful

269
00:11:05,001 --> 00:11:06,702
for the activities you're doing.

270
00:11:07,283 --> 00:11:09,304
One thing we do at Pragma is frequently ask people,

271
00:11:09,784 --> 00:11:11,345
is the time we're spending in meetings useful?

272
00:11:12,246 --> 00:11:14,327
And if we're all just ripping our hair out

273
00:11:14,447 --> 00:11:16,969
in conversations that are not productive or helpful,

274
00:11:17,189 --> 00:11:18,310
it's just a huge waste of time.

275
00:11:19,270 --> 00:11:21,432
And another thought I wanna throw out,

276
00:11:21,672 --> 00:11:23,673
probably breaking the rules of giving a talk,

277
00:11:23,713 --> 00:11:25,394
but I wanna say you might be doing it wrong.

278
00:11:26,914 --> 00:11:31,816
What I mean is that there's like really complex math behind estimation and planning and projections and

279
00:11:31,936 --> 00:11:34,938
Teams will oftentimes adopt a process that kind of looks okay on the surface

280
00:11:35,458 --> 00:11:40,600
But once you dig in you'll find out that it actually violates these underlying principles and ultimately the result is that we have

281
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:46,442
Estimations and dates that don't work. They don't matter. It feels like a waste of time and nobody really gives any

282
00:11:46,923 --> 00:11:49,264
You know and then our projects become late and over budget

283
00:11:50,224 --> 00:11:53,165
Morales poor and you know results in crunch

284
00:11:55,463 --> 00:11:57,725
So, Team Builder was a project we worked on

285
00:11:57,785 --> 00:11:58,565
as part of League of Legends,

286
00:11:59,206 --> 00:12:00,507
and we had a couple goals at the outset.

287
00:12:01,788 --> 00:12:03,809
The first was to eliminate negative experiences

288
00:12:04,049 --> 00:12:04,810
when forming teams.

289
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:07,512
League of Legends was a 5v5 competitive game.

290
00:12:07,532 --> 00:12:09,273
We'd stick five strangers together,

291
00:12:09,673 --> 00:12:11,515
give them 60 seconds to agree on what position

292
00:12:11,535 --> 00:12:12,495
and roles people would play.

293
00:12:12,896 --> 00:12:14,437
Oftentimes you'd get in a fight with your teammates

294
00:12:14,537 --> 00:12:15,558
before the game even started,

295
00:12:15,578 --> 00:12:17,099
and then you're playing this like competitive

296
00:12:17,119 --> 00:12:19,100
40-minute PvP match.

297
00:12:20,463 --> 00:12:27,587
It was really rough and we recognized that we were not giving players a shot at working together as a team.

298
00:12:28,568 --> 00:12:30,929
We also wanted to give players a lot more control over their game experience.

299
00:12:30,949 --> 00:12:35,612
Give them tools to express the style of game they want to play and the experience that they want.

300
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:40,474
It was about 18, eight to 15 members

301
00:12:40,874 --> 00:12:41,555
throughout the project.

302
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:44,277
This was cross-discipline between engineering,

303
00:12:44,557 --> 00:12:47,059
design UX, QA, art, production, and the rest.

304
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:49,341
There were more than 150 people involved

305
00:12:49,361 --> 00:12:50,261
in getting this thing out the door.

306
00:12:50,561 --> 00:12:52,683
We worked across about 20 different product

307
00:12:52,803 --> 00:12:55,866
and publishing and feature teams to get everything done.

308
00:12:55,886 --> 00:12:56,966
It was a very large-scale thing.

309
00:12:58,161 --> 00:13:01,083
And ultimately, it was about 15 months from concept to launch.

310
00:13:01,924 --> 00:13:03,705
It scaled to support a massive number of players.

311
00:13:04,285 --> 00:13:05,987
And we ultimately were able to avoid

312
00:13:06,027 --> 00:13:08,288
crunching in this project.

313
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:10,710
We shipped without player-facing bugs,

314
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,191
something that the team was really proud about.

315
00:13:12,812 --> 00:13:13,632
We had happy players.

316
00:13:14,213 --> 00:13:16,134
We received high ratings on the user experience

317
00:13:16,154 --> 00:13:17,195
and the actual feature.

318
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,669
And at a time when most features came with thousands upon thousands of player support

319
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,178
ticket requests complaining about bugs and problems and issues, we only got a handful

320
00:13:28,338 --> 00:13:29,801
and most of them were to say thank you for the feature.

321
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:34,633
What we're gonna do is break down how this team ran,

322
00:13:35,214 --> 00:13:37,595
explore the mechanics of how the team operated.

323
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,376
I wanna talk about the good times and the bad.

324
00:13:39,416 --> 00:13:41,638
It was not smooth sailing, even though, you know,

325
00:13:41,658 --> 00:13:43,379
I was very excited about the result.

326
00:13:44,140 --> 00:13:45,701
And hopefully there's something practical

327
00:13:45,861 --> 00:13:48,382
you can take away and take back to your teams.

328
00:13:51,444 --> 00:13:52,565
So at the outset of the project,

329
00:13:53,066 --> 00:13:55,227
I was asked to give a gut check estimate.

330
00:13:55,247 --> 00:13:57,889
I was told this was not a formal commitment.

331
00:13:58,842 --> 00:14:00,924
And we did some story mapping, we had a design doc

332
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:03,125
that we reviewed as a team and we broke some stuff out.

333
00:14:03,365 --> 00:14:04,746
And we said, you know, we think this is about

334
00:14:04,766 --> 00:14:05,566
a six month effort.

335
00:14:07,327 --> 00:14:09,008
We then spent the next three months just trying

336
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,509
to get an internal test environment.

337
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,071
We had a reboot and false alarm on our client technology

338
00:14:13,091 --> 00:14:14,892
that caused us to like a multi-week rewrite.

339
00:14:15,392 --> 00:14:17,073
So in no time at all, we were already approaching

340
00:14:17,113 --> 00:14:18,294
our six month mark.

341
00:14:18,874 --> 00:14:20,055
And suddenly the tone changed.

342
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,376
We started being asked, you know, why aren't you done yet?

343
00:14:23,297 --> 00:14:24,738
What are you gonna do to fix this?

344
00:14:25,996 --> 00:14:27,157
This was a pretty scary moment.

345
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:28,758
I hadn't been at the company very long,

346
00:14:29,598 --> 00:14:31,619
and I got this secondhand message that said,

347
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,881
well, leadership says that your team had better crunch

348
00:14:34,061 --> 00:14:35,441
because how else are you gonna get this done?

349
00:14:36,485 --> 00:14:37,507
So I went home and talked to my wife.

350
00:14:37,547 --> 00:14:39,068
We had actually just moved across the country,

351
00:14:39,088 --> 00:14:40,270
had young kids at home.

352
00:14:40,870 --> 00:14:41,551
I was really scared.

353
00:14:41,952 --> 00:14:43,633
And the conversation I had was like,

354
00:14:43,694 --> 00:14:45,235
hey, are you okay moving back home?

355
00:14:45,395 --> 00:14:46,617
Because this may not work out.

356
00:14:47,378 --> 00:14:48,599
I had made a commitment to my family

357
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,661
about the boundaries of my work life.

358
00:14:51,382 --> 00:14:52,984
And that wasn't something I was ready

359
00:14:53,004 --> 00:14:54,245
to compromise on that time.

360
00:14:54,326 --> 00:14:54,886
But I was scared.

361
00:14:55,887 --> 00:15:02,112
Very scared. So our team kind of rounded up back at the office and we put together kind of

362
00:15:02,572 --> 00:15:06,155
everything we had. So we brought back to stakeholders the schedule and the timeline we had

363
00:15:06,175 --> 00:15:10,598
built. We showed our velocity and the progress the team was making. We had a running version

364
00:15:10,658 --> 00:15:13,681
of the feature always available so we could boot it up and show everything that was

365
00:15:13,721 --> 00:15:16,923
working. And there were pieces that were already online and functional but clearly we

366
00:15:16,943 --> 00:15:17,403
weren't done yet.

367
00:15:18,499 --> 00:15:21,141
And we had projections that were useful.

368
00:15:21,201 --> 00:15:23,022
We actually, at that point in the project,

369
00:15:23,062 --> 00:15:24,624
were able to say, okay, we're not done yet,

370
00:15:24,684 --> 00:15:26,225
but we do see ourselves landing,

371
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,946
based on everything we know,

372
00:15:28,006 --> 00:15:29,387
at this period of time, nine months later.

373
00:15:30,048 --> 00:15:31,809
And importantly, we had enough data and information

374
00:15:31,829 --> 00:15:33,491
at that point to make that prediction

375
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:35,732
in a way that was actually powered by data,

376
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:38,214
which meant we actually knew how fast we moved as a team.

377
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:41,132
And it was really interesting because in this circumstance,

378
00:15:41,212 --> 00:15:42,752
when we showed real useful data,

379
00:15:42,852 --> 00:15:44,393
we had a working version of the feature,

380
00:15:45,774 --> 00:15:48,676
things settled down in terms of the stakeholder

381
00:15:48,716 --> 00:15:49,256
kind of pressures.

382
00:15:49,976 --> 00:15:52,478
They had the confidence to see that we did have a plan.

383
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,639
And ultimately, kind of the appeal I made was like,

384
00:15:54,919 --> 00:15:56,260
if you need somebody who can go faster,

385
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:57,961
I don't know how to help you in this, you know,

386
00:15:58,301 --> 00:16:00,442
because I think we're doing everything we can sustainably,

387
00:16:00,782 --> 00:16:02,603
but we do have a plan and I think we can deliver.

388
00:16:03,651 --> 00:16:07,875
And so once they heard that message and saw that we had real substance behind our plans,

389
00:16:08,396 --> 00:16:10,378
you know, they actually started supporting our team.

390
00:16:11,499 --> 00:16:16,463
In this circumstance, being disciplined in our process and our planning gave us the ability

391
00:16:16,503 --> 00:16:22,449
to push back, and we actually got a different message that came down the pipe later that

392
00:16:22,469 --> 00:16:25,953
said, hey, if anyone's trying to crunch your team, that's unacceptable.

393
00:16:26,951 --> 00:16:29,493
And I wanna be clear, I know that this is not

394
00:16:29,533 --> 00:16:30,874
the circumstance all of us have lived.

395
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,396
So I'm not saying that this is somehow a magic

396
00:16:34,057 --> 00:16:35,438
silver bullet that's gonna fix everything.

397
00:16:35,898 --> 00:16:38,140
But in this circumstance, it was really interesting

398
00:16:38,180 --> 00:16:40,862
to see that once we were able to create some confidence

399
00:16:41,643 --> 00:16:42,683
within the stakeholder team,

400
00:16:43,144 --> 00:16:45,226
some of that pressure was alleviated.

401
00:16:46,767 --> 00:16:48,488
All right, so we're gonna basically pose a question.

402
00:16:48,508 --> 00:16:50,209
This would be like a starting point to have a conversation

403
00:16:50,370 --> 00:16:51,230
between yourself, your team.

404
00:16:52,351 --> 00:16:54,016
And we're gonna kind of propose that,

405
00:16:54,056 --> 00:16:55,500
and then I'm gonna break down what we were doing

406
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:58,449
as a team to kind of address this idea on the project.

407
00:17:02,342 --> 00:17:06,005
So first is the question, do you have realistic estimates?

408
00:17:06,665 --> 00:17:08,807
And I think this probably strikes a,

409
00:17:09,887 --> 00:17:13,049
might feel a little sarcastic, but it's not.

410
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,891
I think that most of us deal with estimates

411
00:17:16,031 --> 00:17:17,052
that are basically useless.

412
00:17:17,092 --> 00:17:19,374
You put a date on it, and either you just blow by that date

413
00:17:19,394 --> 00:17:21,515
and it doesn't mean anything, or it's weaponized, right?

414
00:17:21,615 --> 00:17:22,796
And suddenly you're being held to,

415
00:17:22,956 --> 00:17:23,957
you know, your feet to the fire.

416
00:17:24,902 --> 00:17:27,883
But estimates are really important if we're gonna manage budgets, right?

417
00:17:27,943 --> 00:17:30,304
And we don't always talk about the money involved in games,

418
00:17:30,364 --> 00:17:33,185
but it is true that, you know, it costs money to build games,

419
00:17:33,325 --> 00:17:35,426
and so there's, somebody has to be tracking the budget,

420
00:17:35,486 --> 00:17:36,606
make sure we don't run out of cash.

421
00:17:39,627 --> 00:17:41,148
I think a lot of us don't know what estimates are for.

422
00:17:42,868 --> 00:17:43,469
Right? We just said it.

423
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,730
It's like, either they're useless and they're just stale,

424
00:17:45,770 --> 00:17:46,590
sitting in Jira somewhere,

425
00:17:47,130 --> 00:17:49,111
or they're weaponized and used against us.

426
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:52,627
So in our case, we were able to produce estimates

427
00:17:52,647 --> 00:17:54,528
that actually let us predict nine months in the future

428
00:17:54,548 --> 00:17:55,308
and stick the landing.

429
00:17:55,388 --> 00:17:56,948
And we did so without crunching at the end.

430
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:58,929
So how did we produce those useful estimates?

431
00:18:01,409 --> 00:18:03,209
The first thing that is really, really critical

432
00:18:03,229 --> 00:18:04,850
to understand is estimates are not a commitment.

433
00:18:05,850 --> 00:18:07,570
You're asking somebody to predict the future

434
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:08,931
of something that is complex.

435
00:18:09,091 --> 00:18:11,951
Games are just incredibly complex, as we all know.

436
00:18:11,971 --> 00:18:15,372
It's technology, it's servers, it's clients, it's graphics,

437
00:18:15,512 --> 00:18:18,093
it's 3D, it's art, it's animation, it's narrative.

438
00:18:18,173 --> 00:18:18,973
Like, it's all of it.

439
00:18:19,579 --> 00:18:21,822
It takes so much to create games, and that's hard.

440
00:18:22,503 --> 00:18:25,227
So estimates are not meant to be a commitment

441
00:18:25,267 --> 00:18:26,149
to when the work is done.

442
00:18:26,469 --> 00:18:27,891
They're meant to represent an average.

443
00:18:28,192 --> 00:18:30,635
If we did 100 stories that are about this difficult,

444
00:18:31,096 --> 00:18:33,579
what is the middle point on the graph of how long it takes?

445
00:18:34,779 --> 00:18:39,903
And this is, gets into some of that complex math. I will have resources at the end of stuff to

446
00:18:40,003 --> 00:18:43,285
kinda check out. It gets pretty wonky and math heavy. But if you wanna understand the

447
00:18:43,345 --> 00:18:47,508
underlying reason why there's a fundamental difference between understanding that this is

448
00:18:47,628 --> 00:18:52,811
on a, a, a, a bell curve of averages, it, it's useful to know. Um, you could also just

449
00:18:52,851 --> 00:18:58,735
trust me and just kinda stick to it. But uh, but it's, it's tough. So, let's use 3 days as

450
00:18:58,795 --> 00:19:03,458
our example, as, as we see up here. And it's important to recognize, sometimes it'll just

451
00:19:03,478 --> 00:19:03,798
take a day.

452
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,585
You know, it always feels like you get lucky

453
00:19:05,625 --> 00:19:06,825
when it takes less time.

454
00:19:07,806 --> 00:19:09,547
But, you know, sometimes it'll take five days

455
00:19:09,727 --> 00:19:10,327
and that's okay.

456
00:19:11,408 --> 00:19:13,449
In fact, it's not just okay, it's actually expected.

457
00:19:13,649 --> 00:19:15,690
Like mathematically we expect variation

458
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:16,831
in how long these things take.

459
00:19:17,491 --> 00:19:18,992
And so that's gotta be part of our process.

460
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,572
And another thing to consider, though,

461
00:19:22,672 --> 00:19:24,833
is that you could just throw away estimates altogether

462
00:19:24,853 --> 00:19:26,154
and just say, oh, the game's done when it's done.

463
00:19:26,774 --> 00:19:27,595
But that gets really hard.

464
00:19:28,015 --> 00:19:30,336
So we do have this bell curve, right?

465
00:19:30,516 --> 00:19:31,497
Three days is our average.

466
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:33,058
If you start getting up to day 10,

467
00:19:33,298 --> 00:19:35,199
that is a time to check in and say, wait a minute.

468
00:19:35,219 --> 00:19:37,400
We're now three times longer than we thought it would take.

469
00:19:37,841 --> 00:19:39,522
And it's worth having a conversation at that point

470
00:19:39,542 --> 00:19:42,383
and say, wait, did we just load up on six new features

471
00:19:42,463 --> 00:19:44,584
and that we shoved into this after we did the planning?

472
00:19:45,245 --> 00:19:47,727
That's something you have to be really careful and disciplined about as a team.

473
00:19:47,787 --> 00:19:52,212
I'd say scope creep causes a huge amount of challenges.

474
00:19:52,652 --> 00:19:54,434
Sometimes it's just discovered complexity.

475
00:19:54,574 --> 00:19:56,356
The task was actually harder than we thought it was.

476
00:19:56,957 --> 00:19:59,499
And that's okay to understand, but now we have to check in

477
00:19:59,539 --> 00:20:02,723
because what was valuable to us as a three-day story...

478
00:20:03,083 --> 00:20:04,906
may not be worth it if it's gonna be 30 days

479
00:20:05,186 --> 00:20:07,008
because there's so many other features we could be building.

480
00:20:07,209 --> 00:20:09,352
So checking in, you have to watch

481
00:20:09,832 --> 00:20:11,414
how far away from the average you're getting

482
00:20:11,695 --> 00:20:13,738
and there is a moment where you do need to have a discussion

483
00:20:13,778 --> 00:20:15,540
and sometimes you do need to pivot or make changes.

484
00:20:17,171 --> 00:20:19,912
So, you know, and this happened to my team not long ago.

485
00:20:19,952 --> 00:20:21,012
We made a two-point story.

486
00:20:21,312 --> 00:20:23,733
It was meant to be like, unblock us in one or two days

487
00:20:23,953 --> 00:20:25,333
because we had this really complex feature

488
00:20:25,353 --> 00:20:27,514
we wanted to work on later, but we didn't have time for it.

489
00:20:27,574 --> 00:20:28,974
So we said, let's just unlock ourselves

490
00:20:29,534 --> 00:20:30,575
and then we'll get back to it later.

491
00:20:31,195 --> 00:20:34,476
Well, somehow, four weeks passed and we still weren't done.

492
00:20:35,196 --> 00:20:37,397
And we didn't really check in at that 10-day moment

493
00:20:37,437 --> 00:20:38,737
or at some point on the journey.

494
00:20:39,657 --> 00:20:41,298
Because of that, we kind of let this thing run too long.

495
00:20:41,338 --> 00:20:43,419
And of course, there was like massive amounts of scope creep.

496
00:20:43,439 --> 00:20:45,740
We had basically shoved all those complex features

497
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,462
that we were trying to wait on, had gotten added back in.

498
00:20:49,162 --> 00:20:52,584
And, you know, and it was significantly complex.

499
00:20:52,624 --> 00:20:54,265
Like we had some tech debt we didn't account for

500
00:20:54,325 --> 00:20:56,406
and all the rest that I think we're all accustomed to.

501
00:20:56,726 --> 00:20:57,646
But my point being that,

502
00:20:58,327 --> 00:21:00,007
while we're not treating estimates as commitments

503
00:21:00,047 --> 00:21:01,068
and trying to hold people to it,

504
00:21:01,628 --> 00:21:02,869
you know, hold people's feet to the fire,

505
00:21:03,189 --> 00:21:04,690
at the same time, you do need to watch.

506
00:21:04,850 --> 00:21:05,870
And once you get out of bounds,

507
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:08,271
like you should check back in and make some adjustments.

508
00:21:10,679 --> 00:21:12,600
All right, so I think this is how most of us plan.

509
00:21:12,881 --> 00:21:14,242
You put the features on a list.

510
00:21:14,822 --> 00:21:16,143
Oftentimes we stick a date on them,

511
00:21:16,203 --> 00:21:18,024
and we say, okay, we'll do them one, two, three, four, five.

512
00:21:18,725 --> 00:21:20,946
You might look at the end of that estimation

513
00:21:20,986 --> 00:21:22,988
and say, okay, the project's gonna take six weeks long.

514
00:21:25,770 --> 00:21:27,271
This doesn't work at all.

515
00:21:27,571 --> 00:21:28,552
I think all of us do this,

516
00:21:29,092 --> 00:21:30,533
and I promise you it won't work.

517
00:21:30,573 --> 00:21:31,894
I mean, I think we've all experienced it.

518
00:21:31,974 --> 00:21:32,915
It never works this way.

519
00:21:33,455 --> 00:21:34,095
Just think about it,

520
00:21:34,135 --> 00:21:36,397
because you're putting a fixed date on a schedule,

521
00:21:36,417 --> 00:21:37,898
and you're saying it will get done in two days.

522
00:21:38,724 --> 00:21:41,727
Let's just pretend the very first feature you work on takes three days.

523
00:21:42,247 --> 00:21:43,508
Your entire schedule's busted.

524
00:21:43,648 --> 00:21:45,530
Every single date on your entire calendar is wrong,

525
00:21:45,890 --> 00:21:46,851
and you're going to go rebuild it.

526
00:21:47,091 --> 00:21:48,032
If you try to maintain this thing,

527
00:21:48,052 --> 00:21:50,154
you're going to be rebuilding your schedule multiple times a week.

528
00:21:50,714 --> 00:21:54,057
This is an effective tool for planning and delivering.

529
00:21:54,798 --> 00:21:57,040
So, you know, this spiral's out of control.

530
00:21:57,300 --> 00:21:58,841
The other thing is it puts your team on the back foot.

531
00:21:58,962 --> 00:22:01,204
Everyone feels like they're late and behind schedule.

532
00:22:02,004 --> 00:22:03,705
on the third day of the project, right?

533
00:22:04,425 --> 00:22:05,946
Because when you use these fixed dates,

534
00:22:06,066 --> 00:22:07,807
it makes it feel like something's broken

535
00:22:07,967 --> 00:22:08,688
when it takes longer.

536
00:22:08,908 --> 00:22:10,289
But we know it's gonna take longer, right?

537
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,409
That's what we all live every day.

538
00:22:13,290 --> 00:22:14,871
Now, this is a little bit of a weird graph.

539
00:22:15,051 --> 00:22:16,492
Don't try too hard to parse it.

540
00:22:16,952 --> 00:22:19,874
It's just, we're putting these overlapping bell curves,

541
00:22:19,914 --> 00:22:20,774
right, the averages.

542
00:22:21,335 --> 00:22:22,815
And there's a couple really interesting things

543
00:22:22,855 --> 00:22:23,656
to observe about this.

544
00:22:23,736 --> 00:22:25,657
Because on the one hand, we still have a list

545
00:22:25,697 --> 00:22:26,738
of features that we wanna build.

546
00:22:26,798 --> 00:22:29,659
We still have, you know, some kind of ultimate,

547
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,220
like we'll get it done eventually.

548
00:22:32,896 --> 00:22:37,439
But the important thing to understand is like this does not predict whether feature one or two gets done first.

549
00:22:37,799 --> 00:22:42,662
In fact, it literally doesn't even predict when any of the features get done in the individual, right?

550
00:22:43,423 --> 00:22:48,666
And there's this really interesting property that says every single estimate for every single story can be wrong.

551
00:22:49,126 --> 00:22:51,588
Like we just don't know it's we're predicting the future.

552
00:22:52,348 --> 00:22:55,491
But all you have to do is measure how much work gets done each iteration.

553
00:22:56,431 --> 00:22:58,311
And what I mean to say is, you'll get some work done,

554
00:22:58,531 --> 00:22:59,632
some of those stories will clear,

555
00:22:59,992 --> 00:23:01,012
but you're not predicting order,

556
00:23:01,272 --> 00:23:02,812
and you're not holding somebody's feet to the fire

557
00:23:02,872 --> 00:23:04,253
just because the one thing they thought

558
00:23:04,273 --> 00:23:05,893
would only take a day turned out to take three.

559
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:08,354
Now, what's amazing about this then

560
00:23:08,414 --> 00:23:10,154
is you can actually measure progress.

561
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:12,155
You can say, well, we always get five to six things

562
00:23:12,195 --> 00:23:12,975
done every iteration.

563
00:23:13,415 --> 00:23:15,335
Sometimes it was the one that carried over from last time,

564
00:23:15,435 --> 00:23:17,516
sometimes it was something that came in at the last minute,

565
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:19,596
but the team was excited and just chased it down.

566
00:23:20,136 --> 00:23:22,297
And so you can actually create real, durable,

567
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:25,838
valuable, useful velocity that helps you.

568
00:23:26,579 --> 00:23:28,763
predict how long it takes, but what you're not doing

569
00:23:28,823 --> 00:23:31,969
is pinning everyone to an individual completion time

570
00:23:32,049 --> 00:23:32,991
on an individual task.

571
00:23:35,953 --> 00:23:38,474
There's another consideration when we're talking about estimation and planning,

572
00:23:38,994 --> 00:23:40,555
and it's called the cone of uncertainty.

573
00:23:40,835 --> 00:23:43,115
When an idea is brand new, you don't know a lot about it.

574
00:23:43,615 --> 00:23:46,556
And making firm commitments at that point is risky,

575
00:23:46,896 --> 00:23:50,677
because frankly, you're going to learn a lot about your game and your features as you go.

576
00:23:51,577 --> 00:23:56,918
So, what I like to do is separate, we call it a low-resolution estimate and a high-resolution estimate.

577
00:23:57,609 --> 00:24:00,130
the first time an idea comes up, just throw out a number.

578
00:24:00,170 --> 00:24:02,472
If you have two or three people who are subject matter experts,

579
00:24:02,833 --> 00:24:05,655
just let them put a number on it without too much deliberation.

580
00:24:05,755 --> 00:24:07,616
You don't want to spend time planning for something that

581
00:24:07,656 --> 00:24:09,137
might be months away from being worked on.

582
00:24:09,878 --> 00:24:11,239
But when you're a couple iterations away,

583
00:24:11,259 --> 00:24:12,820
it's going to get worked on in the next few weeks,

584
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,141
that's the point where you want to start

585
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,242
breaking it down in more detail.

586
00:24:15,602 --> 00:24:16,763
And what's valuable about that is

587
00:24:17,143 --> 00:24:19,125
you've learned a bunch over the last

588
00:24:19,765 --> 00:24:20,326
weeks, months.

589
00:24:20,986 --> 00:24:23,947
And so by the time this particular story gets

590
00:24:24,027 --> 00:24:25,308
close to the top of the backlog,

591
00:24:25,908 --> 00:24:27,609
that's the time to break it down in detail

592
00:24:27,629 --> 00:24:29,409
and agree what's in, what's out, what's in scope,

593
00:24:29,429 --> 00:24:30,890
what are the completion criteria, right?

594
00:24:30,930 --> 00:24:31,770
What are our requirements?

595
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:34,571
So the idea then is that you put a number

596
00:24:34,631 --> 00:24:35,952
on everything that comes into the backlog,

597
00:24:36,252 --> 00:24:37,693
but don't spend a ton of time on the stuff

598
00:24:37,713 --> 00:24:38,353
that's months away.

599
00:24:38,513 --> 00:24:39,313
It's just a waste of time.

600
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:46,877
Let's talk backlog for a minute. Um, I don't know, backlogs are kind of terrifying in my

601
00:24:46,897 --> 00:24:50,840
experience. Often times they're, like 75% of it is like, I don't even know where any of

602
00:24:50,860 --> 00:24:53,702
these things came from. Like the number of times I've checked that JIRA ticket and I'm

603
00:24:53,722 --> 00:24:55,904
like, who wrote this? It was me.

604
00:24:56,833 --> 00:24:57,914
Like, it happens all the time.

605
00:24:58,674 --> 00:25:00,115
Maybe I shouldn't confess that, I don't know.

606
00:25:01,275 --> 00:25:03,917
But backlogs, again, they take work to manage,

607
00:25:04,017 --> 00:25:05,117
and so there's a couple ideas.

608
00:25:05,257 --> 00:25:08,099
The first is, you do want all the known work you have

609
00:25:08,459 --> 00:25:09,559
to be in the backlog somewhere,

610
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,960
but we just talked about the cone of uncertainty.

611
00:25:12,321 --> 00:25:13,541
So if stuff's like a ways out,

612
00:25:13,781 --> 00:25:15,782
you should just have a big chunky sentence

613
00:25:15,822 --> 00:25:17,863
that describes some big group of features, right?

614
00:25:17,903 --> 00:25:18,703
An epic or something.

615
00:25:19,044 --> 00:25:20,384
And you should put a big number on it

616
00:25:20,404 --> 00:25:22,285
that's kind of in the ballpark, and just leave it alone.

617
00:25:22,865 --> 00:25:27,031
What you shouldn't do is fill up your backlog with, you know, 50 or 75% kind of noise,

618
00:25:27,071 --> 00:25:30,897
which was like one specific edge case for one specific feature that we decided to defer,

619
00:25:30,917 --> 00:25:32,218
and it's been six months.

620
00:25:32,699 --> 00:25:35,643
If you can't in your head, like, predict working on the thing...

621
00:25:36,439 --> 00:25:41,043
within the next like 6 months or so, probably just delete it or kinda group it back up into

622
00:25:41,083 --> 00:25:45,287
some epic. Because what's gonna happen is if you open up your backlog and half of the stuff

623
00:25:45,307 --> 00:25:50,331
in there is kinda irrelevant or hard to, you know, really grok, then it's just gonna feel

624
00:25:50,351 --> 00:25:54,515
like a mess. So we have to maintain a backlog. The other thing is that we want a stable

625
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:57,317
backlog in the sense that we've got a prioritized list of work to do.

626
00:25:57,957 --> 00:25:59,718
But it's a super dynamic list.

627
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:03,319
So being stable should not mean static, right?

628
00:26:03,379 --> 00:26:05,659
Because literally all of games is about discovering, right?

629
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:06,919
We're trying to find fun things.

630
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,900
You might spend a bunch of time working on something,

631
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:09,880
realize it's not working,

632
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,380
and you're gonna have to move on.

633
00:26:12,161 --> 00:26:13,721
So when we talk about maintaining the backlog,

634
00:26:13,941 --> 00:26:16,042
the thing is gonna be evolving and changing all the time.

635
00:26:16,702 --> 00:26:18,162
But just keep it clean and tidy.

636
00:26:18,542 --> 00:26:20,063
If stuff's too far out, either delete it

637
00:26:20,363 --> 00:26:21,683
or roll it into one of these epics

638
00:26:21,903 --> 00:26:23,783
so that you've got some sanity.

639
00:26:25,022 --> 00:26:27,285
For me, my sense check is if I crack open the backlog,

640
00:26:27,585 --> 00:26:29,807
I should be able to browse and everything should resonate.

641
00:26:29,887 --> 00:26:31,329
I should be like, okay, these are all things

642
00:26:31,349 --> 00:26:33,091
that are understandable, like they're in the context

643
00:26:33,111 --> 00:26:33,912
of what we're working on.

644
00:26:34,412 --> 00:26:36,734
And if I start seeing a large amount of just

645
00:26:37,135 --> 00:26:39,898
kind of junk or noise, then we gotta clean it up.

646
00:26:42,866 --> 00:26:44,486
This one is a little bit technical.

647
00:26:45,067 --> 00:26:46,727
A consistent measure of estimation.

648
00:26:46,987 --> 00:26:49,608
Now people have used t-shirt sizes, Fibonacci,

649
00:26:49,668 --> 00:26:50,788
there's all sorts of different frameworks.

650
00:26:51,548 --> 00:26:53,608
Fibonacci does have some really nice characteristics.

651
00:26:54,809 --> 00:26:56,609
The nice thing is that those smaller numbers

652
00:26:56,649 --> 00:26:58,150
at the beginning, one, two, three, five,

653
00:26:58,570 --> 00:27:00,530
they're kinda high detail, so you have a little bit

654
00:27:00,550 --> 00:27:02,170
of separation between how hard something is.

655
00:27:02,571 --> 00:27:03,491
But then they kinda scale up.

656
00:27:03,531 --> 00:27:05,091
You know, you get to eight, 13, 20.

657
00:27:05,551 --> 00:27:08,492
The whole point is that the larger the work is,

658
00:27:08,572 --> 00:27:10,232
the less precise it is, right?

659
00:27:10,252 --> 00:27:11,132
We don't have a 20 and a 21 and a 22.

660
00:27:12,713 --> 00:27:13,553
It's just like, eh, it's about 20.

661
00:27:13,713 --> 00:27:15,775
And then we go to 40 and 100 and infinity.

662
00:27:16,235 --> 00:27:18,296
So I do like Fibonacci, but the critical thing

663
00:27:18,316 --> 00:27:21,538
is if you're trying to use your,

664
00:27:21,578 --> 00:27:22,578
if you're trying to build a process

665
00:27:22,598 --> 00:27:24,459
that lets you predict when you're gonna be done,

666
00:27:24,899 --> 00:27:26,220
just stick to one measure.

667
00:27:26,420 --> 00:27:27,601
Don't change it every couple months

668
00:27:27,661 --> 00:27:29,002
because people have decided, oh,

669
00:27:29,402 --> 00:27:31,983
if we change to ideal work hours,

670
00:27:32,083 --> 00:27:33,164
that'll be a better system.

671
00:27:33,464 --> 00:27:34,425
You wanna be really consistent.

672
00:27:34,765 --> 00:27:37,906
The other one, this is a huge thing to watch out for.

673
00:27:38,327 --> 00:27:40,248
Do not change the original estimate

674
00:27:40,428 --> 00:27:41,148
after you've done the work.

675
00:27:41,915 --> 00:27:43,577
We already agreed that estimates are gonna be

676
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:44,797
an average completion time.

677
00:27:45,218 --> 00:27:47,179
So when that thing that you thought would take three days

678
00:27:47,239 --> 00:27:49,781
takes a week and a half, don't bump the number up.

679
00:27:50,302 --> 00:27:52,403
And this, it's a hard one to explain,

680
00:27:52,463 --> 00:27:55,205
but basically what you're doing is turning your

681
00:27:55,946 --> 00:27:59,368
backlog full of estimation into that fixed schedule, right?

682
00:27:59,408 --> 00:28:00,629
If you change the number after the fact,

683
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:03,111
you've actually erased the estimate.

684
00:28:03,611 --> 00:28:04,752
And what happens then is that

685
00:28:04,792 --> 00:28:06,273
your future estimates won't work.

686
00:28:06,494 --> 00:28:08,575
Basically, it's a lot,

687
00:28:09,907 --> 00:28:17,612
Yeah, I'll point you at the resources at the end of the talk, but just trust me that if you're backfitting your numbers after the work gets done, they're not going to be predictive anymore.

688
00:28:18,173 --> 00:28:19,754
And that means your schedule won't work.

689
00:28:20,654 --> 00:28:22,355
So just keep the estimates as they were.

690
00:28:23,316 --> 00:28:29,120
You will oftentimes, though, find that scope creep has happened, so you break out a new story and put it back on the backlog.

691
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:33,403
So there's a lot of opportunity for you to account for that work, but don't just change the numbers.

692
00:28:37,805 --> 00:28:41,248
The last piece, I know we spent a lot of time on estimation,

693
00:28:41,288 --> 00:28:43,490
but I do think that this gets to that responsible

694
00:28:43,530 --> 00:28:44,471
leadership and management.

695
00:28:44,992 --> 00:28:47,474
The reason this stuff matters is that if we put ourselves

696
00:28:47,514 --> 00:28:49,195
on a good footing in terms of how our team runs,

697
00:28:49,556 --> 00:28:51,757
it gives us so much better chance to kind of close in

698
00:28:51,837 --> 00:28:56,061
on landing our launch without accumulating all this pressure

699
00:28:56,321 --> 00:28:58,483
and stress and hidden work that we don't find out

700
00:28:58,543 --> 00:28:59,924
until a month before release.

701
00:29:00,965 --> 00:29:02,367
So the last piece is discovered work.

702
00:29:02,827 --> 00:29:04,368
And this is the idea that when you're trying to solve

703
00:29:04,448 --> 00:29:05,689
one problem, you'll find two more.

704
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:08,783
probably more true in games than anything else

705
00:29:08,823 --> 00:29:09,404
as far as I know.

706
00:29:09,424 --> 00:29:11,006
This is called discovered work.

707
00:29:11,607 --> 00:29:12,889
And it's really, really key.

708
00:29:13,069 --> 00:29:14,491
If you're trying to predict

709
00:29:15,032 --> 00:29:17,155
when your milestone's gonna be complete.

710
00:29:18,502 --> 00:29:21,784
And let's imagine your team does 20 story points every iteration.

711
00:29:22,125 --> 00:29:23,265
And you've got 100 points left.

712
00:29:23,345 --> 00:29:25,707
And you think, ta-da, it'll take us five iterations.

713
00:29:26,548 --> 00:29:29,650
You have to know exactly how many story points are being generated

714
00:29:29,810 --> 00:29:30,730
every iteration, right?

715
00:29:30,790 --> 00:29:32,491
Because you're going to be adding new stuff to the backlog.

716
00:29:32,952 --> 00:29:37,975
So if you're completing 20, but discovering 10 new points,

717
00:29:38,455 --> 00:29:40,977
then every iteration that passes is going to be accumulating new work.

718
00:29:41,057 --> 00:29:42,478
And I'd say this is probably the most common.

719
00:29:43,539 --> 00:29:50,304
Mistake I've seen when people are trying to build these roadmaps these projections is that they're not factoring in the average amount of discovered work

720
00:29:50,344 --> 00:29:51,425
That they have each time

721
00:29:52,535 --> 00:29:53,075
each iteration.

722
00:29:53,515 --> 00:29:55,436
And this is a really powerful tool also

723
00:29:55,496 --> 00:29:56,757
to measure your team's discipline.

724
00:29:57,277 --> 00:29:58,378
When your project is brand new,

725
00:29:58,678 --> 00:30:00,199
you're gonna have so much discovery.

726
00:30:00,319 --> 00:30:01,999
Oftentimes I think you have as much discovery

727
00:30:02,019 --> 00:30:02,740
as you're getting work done.

728
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,381
So like, at the beginning of a project,

729
00:30:04,541 --> 00:30:06,061
you're not even getting closer to release

730
00:30:06,462 --> 00:30:08,243
because the team is figuring everything out,

731
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:08,703
you're learning.

732
00:30:09,123 --> 00:30:10,003
And so what you'll see is,

733
00:30:10,224 --> 00:30:11,984
well, we got 20 points of work done,

734
00:30:12,265 --> 00:30:13,465
but we discovered 20 new points.

735
00:30:14,025 --> 00:30:16,387
And what has to happen as you approach your deadline,

736
00:30:16,447 --> 00:30:17,448
as you approach your milestone,

737
00:30:17,788 --> 00:30:19,189
is you have to start saying no.

738
00:30:19,870 --> 00:30:23,432
So that discovered work needs to decrease over time.

739
00:30:23,892 --> 00:30:27,055
So your discovery measurement needs to decline

740
00:30:27,175 --> 00:30:28,596
as you get closer and closer to your milestone.

741
00:30:28,636 --> 00:30:31,958
That's the team one, learning amongst each other,

742
00:30:32,378 --> 00:30:34,000
you know, this is the feature we're building,

743
00:30:34,060 --> 00:30:35,821
and learning how to kind of say no and be clear.

744
00:30:36,121 --> 00:30:37,702
And it's also just demonstrating discipline

745
00:30:37,742 --> 00:30:40,604
that if we always, you know, add new features,

746
00:30:41,265 --> 00:30:41,845
we'll never finish.

747
00:30:44,935 --> 00:30:46,676
I do want to talk a little bit about team composition

748
00:30:46,776 --> 00:30:47,477
and stable teams.

749
00:30:47,857 --> 00:30:49,358
It's a huge value that we have at Pragma

750
00:30:49,378 --> 00:30:51,839
is long-lived teams, which is like keep teams together.

751
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:54,661
I would say most studios talk about this,

752
00:30:54,881 --> 00:30:55,962
but then you look at what they do,

753
00:30:56,022 --> 00:30:57,723
and what happens is every couple weeks,

754
00:30:57,743 --> 00:30:59,224
they're like, oh, but I need a UX designer,

755
00:30:59,244 --> 00:31:00,765
and so they go grab one and rip them out

756
00:31:00,805 --> 00:31:02,506
of the group of the team they're working on.

757
00:31:04,508 --> 00:31:05,949
I think we all understand, or at least,

758
00:31:06,229 --> 00:31:08,070
if you follow any competitive sport,

759
00:31:08,330 --> 00:31:10,151
you know that the best teams in the world

760
00:31:10,192 --> 00:31:12,013
are not composed of the five players

761
00:31:12,053 --> 00:31:12,933
with the highest stats.

762
00:31:13,878 --> 00:31:14,578
Never works that way.

763
00:31:15,179 --> 00:31:16,800
Teams are built out of our relationships

764
00:31:16,860 --> 00:31:18,060
and our dynamics with one another.

765
00:31:18,120 --> 00:31:20,142
Like it's about the personalities

766
00:31:20,222 --> 00:31:21,562
and the strengths and weaknesses we have.

767
00:31:22,023 --> 00:31:24,424
And so you're only gonna get that experience as a studio

768
00:31:24,804 --> 00:31:27,526
if you let your teams gel and build a chemistry together.

769
00:31:28,226 --> 00:31:30,548
So the other thing that happens oftentimes

770
00:31:31,208 --> 00:31:32,369
on the side of estimation

771
00:31:32,749 --> 00:31:34,130
is you might have like open head count

772
00:31:34,150 --> 00:31:36,471
for a few new engineers or artists.

773
00:31:37,172 --> 00:31:41,413
And it's really tempting to use those individuals

774
00:31:41,773 --> 00:31:43,834
that don't exist yet in your projection

775
00:31:43,854 --> 00:31:45,114
of how long the project's gonna take.

776
00:31:45,695 --> 00:31:48,396
So it's crucial, no matter how hard you're trying to hire,

777
00:31:48,936 --> 00:31:50,576
you need to be really disciplined

778
00:31:50,616 --> 00:31:52,537
about not trying to incorporate your open head count

779
00:31:52,997 --> 00:31:54,418
as though they're gonna actively

780
00:31:54,818 --> 00:31:56,238
support finishing the milestone.

781
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:59,899
In particular, we all know how hard hiring is.

782
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:00,980
It takes a huge amount of time.

783
00:32:01,160 --> 00:32:03,221
If a team is fully loaded trying to hire,

784
00:32:03,241 --> 00:32:04,681
in my experience, that can take 20 to 30% hit.

785
00:32:06,222 --> 00:32:07,322
to the team's productivity.

786
00:32:07,462 --> 00:32:09,384
So you're actually going slower as you attempt to hire.

787
00:32:10,024 --> 00:32:10,884
Not to mention onboarding.

788
00:32:10,904 --> 00:32:12,825
We also know that it takes months, oftentimes,

789
00:32:13,126 --> 00:32:13,866
to get up to speed.

790
00:32:14,286 --> 00:32:15,807
So if you're bringing new people on the project,

791
00:32:16,247 --> 00:32:17,068
you're gonna go slower.

792
00:32:17,228 --> 00:32:19,549
Your team is onboarding those new folks and teaching them.

793
00:32:20,170 --> 00:32:23,211
So your experts are not gonna be going as fast.

794
00:32:23,752 --> 00:32:25,553
And long term, of course, you're gonna get payoff

795
00:32:25,793 --> 00:32:27,033
because you've got a new team member.

796
00:32:27,534 --> 00:32:29,495
But you'll be going slower in the short term.

797
00:32:29,635 --> 00:32:31,136
So please be aware of that.

798
00:32:31,516 --> 00:32:34,498
Definitely do not incorporate open headcount.

799
00:32:34,898 --> 00:32:37,579
into your prediction on how quickly things will get done.

800
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:40,861
All right, so here's the big recap

801
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:42,722
of all the things we're trying to think about

802
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:43,602
with estimation planning.

803
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,643
And we'll kind of speed up from here,

804
00:32:45,683 --> 00:32:47,144
but this one is just kind of near and dear

805
00:32:47,184 --> 00:32:51,166
to really doing a great job operating our team day to day.

806
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:54,347
And unfortunately my notes are not written correctly,

807
00:32:54,387 --> 00:32:55,868
so I'm gonna lean in a little bit here.

808
00:32:57,920 --> 00:32:59,781
So we're talking about estimates are averages

809
00:32:59,801 --> 00:33:00,581
and not commitments.

810
00:33:00,961 --> 00:33:04,463
We're talking about not changing our numbers after the fact.

811
00:33:05,124 --> 00:33:06,324
We have stable long-lived teams.

812
00:33:08,746 --> 00:33:10,607
All the known work, everything we understand

813
00:33:10,667 --> 00:33:12,208
has to get done is accounted for,

814
00:33:12,708 --> 00:33:14,749
but only high-resolution estimates

815
00:33:14,809 --> 00:33:16,190
on the stuff we're about to work on.

816
00:33:17,411 --> 00:33:19,872
We're gonna maintain a relevant prioritized backlog,

817
00:33:20,472 --> 00:33:22,033
and we're gonna measure that discovered work.

818
00:33:24,135 --> 00:33:24,375
Easy.

819
00:33:28,582 --> 00:33:31,006
All right, so we're gonna move on to a few other topics.

820
00:33:31,026 --> 00:33:32,629
And the first one is about knowledge silos.

821
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,955
You know, I'd say every game team I've worked with

822
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:38,018
says like, oh, we don't wanna have silos, right?

823
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:39,621
But in practice, it's like, oops, like.

824
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:42,162
You know, one person on the team knows this area

825
00:33:42,182 --> 00:33:43,322
and they're the only one who can work on it.

826
00:33:44,103 --> 00:33:45,504
You know, when we talk about maintaining

827
00:33:45,544 --> 00:33:46,565
a healthy work-life balance,

828
00:33:47,145 --> 00:33:48,906
if your team is gonna be held hostage

829
00:33:48,946 --> 00:33:50,047
when one person is missing,

830
00:33:50,487 --> 00:33:51,848
it creates a lot of pressure for people

831
00:33:51,888 --> 00:33:53,449
not to take time off, right?

832
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,171
It's scary to take, you know, PTO

833
00:33:56,371 --> 00:33:58,813
if you're the one person who knows something critical.

834
00:33:59,554 --> 00:34:01,275
And it can create a lot of trouble, I think,

835
00:34:01,335 --> 00:34:02,956
across your team, and it creates a really...

836
00:34:04,102 --> 00:34:08,665
imbalance to situations where it's hard to operate as a team and instead we

837
00:34:08,685 --> 00:34:10,466
become this like group of individuals.

838
00:34:12,987 --> 00:34:17,629
So, I inherited a legacy matchmaking system. It was really complex, gnarly

839
00:34:17,970 --> 00:34:21,091
code base. And this thing had been entirely siloed. Only one engineer

840
00:34:21,111 --> 00:34:25,033
worked on it at a time. Usually they'd own it for a handful of months before

841
00:34:25,073 --> 00:34:28,075
passing it off. But there was no knowledge transfer. There was no cross

842
00:34:28,115 --> 00:34:31,897
training. And it was a super complex code base.

843
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,061
very difficult to understand.

844
00:34:35,221 --> 00:34:36,883
So we had this feature that if a player came back

845
00:34:36,943 --> 00:34:41,266
after like six months, we wanted to give them a break.

846
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:42,767
Like we don't wanna give them really tough,

847
00:34:43,207 --> 00:34:45,329
you know, sweaty matches because we wanna let them

848
00:34:45,389 --> 00:34:45,869
get back in.

849
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:48,451
It's unlikely that their skill rating is actually as high

850
00:34:48,872 --> 00:34:50,012
as whatever number we have for them.

851
00:34:50,573 --> 00:34:54,676
So we had this nice feature that would give you a little bit of discount to your rating as you came back in.

852
00:34:54,936 --> 00:34:57,318
And it would work for a while, but we saw this weird side effect where

853
00:34:57,679 --> 00:35:00,281
you'd have some easier matches to kind of ease back in, and then bam!

854
00:35:00,301 --> 00:35:03,843
You'd get kind of slammed with like really tough matches, and you go on a big losing streak.

855
00:35:04,244 --> 00:35:06,065
And most players would just give up at that point and leave.

856
00:35:07,206 --> 00:35:09,988
And by the way, so this was happening during the Team Builder project,

857
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:14,532
so we had to maintain the old system as we were trying to build some of the newer features.

858
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:15,693
So...

859
00:35:16,675 --> 00:35:19,659
Basically, nobody on our team could change this codebase without breaking it.

860
00:35:20,019 --> 00:35:22,862
I literally mean 10 out of 10 people attempted to go in and make changes,

861
00:35:23,403 --> 00:35:24,024
all of us broke it.

862
00:35:24,524 --> 00:35:25,906
So it was a really tough situation.

863
00:35:26,306 --> 00:35:29,269
And what happened then was we kind of neglected trying to address this issue

864
00:35:29,289 --> 00:35:30,671
because it was so complex and hard.

865
00:35:30,791 --> 00:35:32,693
And ultimately, it just meant that we were causing this problem

866
00:35:32,713 --> 00:35:34,015
for months longer than we should have

867
00:35:34,495 --> 00:35:37,439
because this siloed codebase made it really difficult for anyone to work in.

868
00:35:38,139 --> 00:35:41,942
And ultimately what had happened was there were basically two copies of the calculation logic.

869
00:35:42,342 --> 00:35:45,645
And so we had fixed the part where we gave you the discount on getting your match.

870
00:35:46,165 --> 00:35:50,849
But when we came to updating your skill rating, we didn't run that same calculation.

871
00:35:51,209 --> 00:35:54,431
What happens then is every win you got against an easier opponent,

872
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:56,773
we were still bumping your skill level higher and higher.

873
00:35:57,253 --> 00:35:58,574
So by the time we take away the discount,

874
00:35:58,674 --> 00:36:01,355
suddenly you're actually like 100 points more skilled

875
00:36:01,515 --> 00:36:03,116
in theory than you were before you left,

876
00:36:03,396 --> 00:36:04,657
which is not reality.

877
00:36:05,097 --> 00:36:07,638
And then we would just punish those players, unfortunately,

878
00:36:08,178 --> 00:36:09,099
and cause a lot of pain.

879
00:36:09,699 --> 00:36:11,680
And so in this case, we created a real problem

880
00:36:11,700 --> 00:36:14,161
for our players because we had this siloed code base

881
00:36:14,181 --> 00:36:15,141
that was really complex.

882
00:36:15,822 --> 00:36:17,943
And it changed how we thought about it

883
00:36:17,983 --> 00:36:18,883
for the Team Builder project.

884
00:36:19,403 --> 00:36:21,624
So one practice we use as a team is called pair programming.

885
00:36:21,844 --> 00:36:23,745
And this is kind of engineering specific, but.

886
00:36:24,484 --> 00:36:28,885
It's an unusual practice, I get that not a ton of teams use it, but it was actually born out of the desire to say,

887
00:36:28,925 --> 00:36:31,206
what if we took a good idea and then took it to an extreme?

888
00:36:31,466 --> 00:36:35,647
In this case, we all tend to agree on the engineering side that code reviews are good.

889
00:36:37,348 --> 00:36:38,788
And it said, what if we did them constantly?

890
00:36:39,008 --> 00:36:42,949
And what's really interesting about this idea is that when you have two brains solving the same problem,

891
00:36:43,349 --> 00:36:46,130
obviously the siloing is, you know, eliminated by default.

892
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,551
It was actually a really powerful thing.

893
00:36:47,571 --> 00:36:49,653
When I moved on from this team that I was part of

894
00:36:50,053 --> 00:36:53,216
for a lot of years, it was really reassuring to me

895
00:36:53,316 --> 00:36:54,837
to know that there was not a single thing

896
00:36:54,877 --> 00:36:58,460
in the entire system that only I knew about, right?

897
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:00,842
And it made it feel a lot safer to move on to my next team

898
00:37:00,922 --> 00:37:03,544
because we had that coverage and expertise built in.

899
00:37:03,564 --> 00:37:05,845
The other thing is we shipped less bugs, you know?

900
00:37:06,046 --> 00:37:08,107
Obviously we're not primarily focused on quality here,

901
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:08,187
but...

902
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:12,951
Quality affects our lives a lot with respect to crunch, right?

903
00:37:14,012 --> 00:37:16,554
Oftentimes we get into the hardening phase on a milestone

904
00:37:16,774 --> 00:37:19,156
or project, and then suddenly it's like, oh, wow,

905
00:37:19,256 --> 00:37:20,037
everything's broken.

906
00:37:20,337 --> 00:37:21,678
And then we're kind of jammed at the end

907
00:37:21,699 --> 00:37:23,060
because we're trying to fix all these things.

908
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,502
And so it also increases your quality

909
00:37:25,522 --> 00:37:26,342
in a really positive way.

910
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:34,229
So we are, I guess we are going to talk about quality after all.

911
00:37:37,454 --> 00:37:38,195
Quality as you go.

912
00:37:38,315 --> 00:37:42,536
So I would say that something I think I've observed

913
00:37:42,576 --> 00:37:46,418
and others have too is that QA can get treated

914
00:37:46,538 --> 00:37:49,639
pretty poorly in how we run things sometimes.

915
00:37:49,759 --> 00:37:51,259
We have a team called Quality Assurance.

916
00:37:51,739 --> 00:37:53,460
Sometimes they're siloed as a group

917
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,241
and they get brought in late in a project

918
00:37:55,261 --> 00:37:57,001
and they're told like, assure quality,

919
00:37:57,061 --> 00:37:57,862
make sure it's great.

920
00:37:58,662 --> 00:37:59,622
But at that point they weren't part

921
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:01,383
of the product development and they didn't have

922
00:38:01,623 --> 00:38:03,384
a seat at the table when we're planning things

923
00:38:03,524 --> 00:38:05,745
and when we were creating these ideas.

924
00:38:06,205 --> 00:38:08,206
And so ultimately, they're oftentimes in a situation

925
00:38:08,366 --> 00:38:09,907
where they just point at something and say,

926
00:38:09,927 --> 00:38:11,448
that's broken, that's broken, that's broken,

927
00:38:11,868 --> 00:38:14,030
which is a really disempowering place to be.

928
00:38:14,810 --> 00:38:16,872
And ultimately what happens then is we're discovering

929
00:38:16,912 --> 00:38:18,593
all of these quality issues right at the end,

930
00:38:18,953 --> 00:38:21,054
and nobody budgeted the extra six months we needed

931
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:22,695
to polish the six months worth of.

932
00:38:23,276 --> 00:38:27,542
features we just built. And so that we end up with this absolute pressure at the end of a

933
00:38:28,363 --> 00:38:31,368
project. So one thing we talk about is a whole team, right?

934
00:38:31,428 --> 00:38:37,076
So it's one thing to say we want logging lift teams, another thing to say that we want everybody at the table at the outset.

935
00:38:39,118 --> 00:38:41,000
So we had QA embedded as part of our team

936
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,040
during the kickoff.

937
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:44,362
They participated in that original mapping.

938
00:38:44,442 --> 00:38:47,063
They participated in the design review and the plan

939
00:38:47,123 --> 00:38:49,585
so that incorporating how we were gonna test

940
00:38:49,625 --> 00:38:50,906
and make sure this thing was actually ready

941
00:38:51,166 --> 00:38:52,447
was built into the team.

942
00:38:53,067 --> 00:38:55,448
And this was a really, really powerful thing that

943
00:38:57,257 --> 00:38:59,037
helped us, and it meant that we didn't have

944
00:38:59,057 --> 00:39:01,458
the same kind of surprises that oftentimes we encounter.

945
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:04,299
So another angle to take on it would be,

946
00:39:04,319 --> 00:39:06,239
do you catch errors as you go?

947
00:39:06,259 --> 00:39:07,900
Or do you kind of shunt them to the side

948
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:09,000
and say, oh, I'll deal with that later?

949
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,801
One practice we use is called test-driven development.

950
00:39:12,041 --> 00:39:14,362
Again, it's a pretty frequently talked about thing,

951
00:39:15,002 --> 00:39:16,162
but it's a really interesting idea.

952
00:39:16,222 --> 00:39:19,403
What you're doing is you're writing a test that says,

953
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:21,584
hey, I'm gonna give a player a discount

954
00:39:21,664 --> 00:39:23,124
if they haven't been back for six months.

955
00:39:23,564 --> 00:39:24,905
And you run a test, and it fails

956
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:26,305
because you haven't run that feature yet.

957
00:39:26,965 --> 00:39:29,107
And then you start coding and trying to write the feature.

958
00:39:29,527 --> 00:39:31,028
And what's really powerful about this technique

959
00:39:31,088 --> 00:39:33,769
is that you're thinking through how to deliver the feature

960
00:39:34,009 --> 00:39:35,010
from the get-go.

961
00:39:35,550 --> 00:39:37,491
And you have this really interesting suite of tests

962
00:39:37,531 --> 00:39:39,192
that help your team and cover you.

963
00:39:39,453 --> 00:39:41,874
You can run that test 1,000 times before you go live.

964
00:39:42,234 --> 00:39:43,595
So if you come back to make a different change

965
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:46,136
to your system later, you've got this regression suite

966
00:39:46,156 --> 00:39:48,058
that's really interesting and really powerful.

967
00:39:48,078 --> 00:39:48,838
So.

968
00:39:52,538 --> 00:39:56,281
Just bringing it all back, I think that what we're looking out for is the 80-20 rule

969
00:39:56,721 --> 00:40:00,203
that says, you know, we think 80% of the features are done,

970
00:40:00,844 --> 00:40:04,466
but then somehow, like, we get hit, you know, on the wrong side of this equation,

971
00:40:04,506 --> 00:40:06,848
and there's, like, the other 80% we didn't account for.

972
00:40:07,528 --> 00:40:10,270
And when we start talking about embedding quality as you go,

973
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:13,872
I think that's how you can account for, like, hey, once we say the feature's done,

974
00:40:13,892 --> 00:40:15,553
we're going to move on and work on the next feature,

975
00:40:15,874 --> 00:40:18,515
and we're not afraid that we're going to get jammed at the end

976
00:40:18,595 --> 00:40:21,437
with all of these things that didn't get accounted for throughout development.

977
00:40:24,871 --> 00:40:26,152
Continuous integration and delivery.

978
00:40:26,212 --> 00:40:27,974
I think the word continuous integration right now,

979
00:40:28,054 --> 00:40:28,995
most people think of it as like,

980
00:40:29,075 --> 00:40:30,216
oh, it's Jenkins or TeamCity.

981
00:40:30,297 --> 00:40:32,379
And those are technologies and they're useful ones.

982
00:40:32,479 --> 00:40:33,880
But the idea is basically like,

983
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:36,323
we just have to ship a single video game, right?

984
00:40:37,764 --> 00:40:38,104
And so.

985
00:40:40,197 --> 00:40:43,799
What happens oftentimes is people want a little sandbox

986
00:40:43,819 --> 00:40:44,179
to work in.

987
00:40:44,199 --> 00:40:45,460
They're like, hey, I want to be able to work

988
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:48,101
without stepping on my colleague's toes, my teammate's toes.

989
00:40:48,802 --> 00:40:50,322
And what happens today, at least,

990
00:40:50,423 --> 00:40:52,023
is we get into these feature branches.

991
00:40:52,744 --> 00:40:54,585
And that can be a useful tool to experiment,

992
00:40:54,945 --> 00:40:56,486
but you have to ask yourself the question of

993
00:40:56,586 --> 00:40:59,048
how long is it going to take after the feature is done

994
00:40:59,648 --> 00:41:01,189
to get into the actual build?

995
00:41:02,222 --> 00:41:04,224
And what you'll find as your team grows and gets bigger,

996
00:41:04,524 --> 00:41:07,147
you'll have people out in the woods for longer and longer.

997
00:41:07,207 --> 00:41:08,528
Teams can be out for weeks and months.

998
00:41:08,689 --> 00:41:10,350
In fact, the most extreme story I've ever heard

999
00:41:10,711 --> 00:41:12,172
was a team that did feature development

1000
00:41:12,192 --> 00:41:15,796
for about six months, and then spent two and a half years.

1001
00:41:16,815 --> 00:41:17,756
integrating those features in.

1002
00:41:18,857 --> 00:41:21,338
And it was just like a crazy knife fight of politics

1003
00:41:21,378 --> 00:41:23,380
about who was allowed to put their code in first.

1004
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:25,341
It was just the most wild story I've ever heard.

1005
00:41:25,921 --> 00:41:27,662
And so it's really important to think about,

1006
00:41:27,903 --> 00:41:28,903
if we're just building one game,

1007
00:41:29,604 --> 00:41:32,165
how do we work day to day in a manner

1008
00:41:32,205 --> 00:41:35,087
that lets us put new code in the system and add features?

1009
00:41:35,147 --> 00:41:36,588
And this applies to art and animation.

1010
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:39,251
and game behaviors, all the different things

1011
00:41:39,291 --> 00:41:39,951
that go into it.

1012
00:41:40,512 --> 00:41:43,153
Now, so there's this idea called trunk-based development,

1013
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:44,654
which is just like we all put our code in

1014
00:41:44,814 --> 00:41:46,375
and we put our art in and our assets in.

1015
00:41:46,695 --> 00:41:48,656
Now, a lot of us, I think, are used to that

1016
00:41:48,696 --> 00:41:49,977
being a very unsafe thing.

1017
00:41:50,337 --> 00:41:51,518
It's a very scary prospect.

1018
00:41:51,898 --> 00:41:53,999
And so the idea is, well, if I just have my sandbox

1019
00:41:54,039 --> 00:41:55,160
on the side, I can work on it,

1020
00:41:55,460 --> 00:41:56,620
and when it's ready, I can bring it in.

1021
00:41:57,121 --> 00:41:58,441
But there's a lot of challenges with that,

1022
00:41:58,722 --> 00:42:00,843
and particularly the two and a half years

1023
00:42:00,863 --> 00:42:03,084
of integration costs, apparently, for that one team.

1024
00:42:04,545 --> 00:42:06,226
But it's more than that though.

1025
00:42:06,646 --> 00:42:09,148
The question is, can we build something as a team together?

1026
00:42:09,248 --> 00:42:10,989
Basically, can I add a new feature to the game

1027
00:42:11,409 --> 00:42:13,090
that isn't going to break everything?

1028
00:42:13,250 --> 00:42:15,471
It actually makes you think in a different way.

1029
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:17,052
If I'm gonna prototype a new character

1030
00:42:17,192 --> 00:42:19,654
and I'm using temp models and temp animation,

1031
00:42:19,714 --> 00:42:22,596
temp assets, have we built tools so that that's safe to do?

1032
00:42:22,656 --> 00:42:25,117
Can I add that in through configuration

1033
00:42:25,157 --> 00:42:26,738
and through data as a designer?

1034
00:42:27,699 --> 00:42:31,541
And can that be done in a way that's not going to immediately crash the game for everyone?

1035
00:42:31,881 --> 00:42:35,584
Can I turn it off and on, right? Feature toggle is a really powerful tool because if you can

1036
00:42:35,964 --> 00:42:40,947
basically make your new features exist without causing harm, then they can be present and the

1037
00:42:40,967 --> 00:42:46,611
people working on them can look and see them, but you're not delaying all of that complexity

1038
00:42:47,051 --> 00:42:48,872
of like how does this actually get into the game.

1039
00:42:49,513 --> 00:42:51,835
And so, again, there's a whole suite of things to think about here,

1040
00:42:51,915 --> 00:42:53,276
but just the high-level idea is,

1041
00:42:53,636 --> 00:42:54,597
we're building one video game,

1042
00:42:54,977 --> 00:42:57,599
let's learn how we can add new stuff to our game every day

1043
00:42:58,059 --> 00:43:00,861
without breaking it.

1044
00:43:01,261 --> 00:43:02,662
And it changes your mindset.

1045
00:43:03,023 --> 00:43:04,684
And you can think in a way that says, like,

1046
00:43:04,764 --> 00:43:05,424
I know how to do this.

1047
00:43:09,627 --> 00:43:10,008
All right, so...

1048
00:43:13,081 --> 00:43:14,762
Basically, we broke down a handful of questions.

1049
00:43:14,842 --> 00:43:16,283
I think these are fine starting points.

1050
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:17,923
Again, some of this could be self-assessment,

1051
00:43:17,943 --> 00:43:18,744
where you're at as a team.

1052
00:43:19,124 --> 00:43:20,925
And it could also be a starting point for a conversation.

1053
00:43:21,866 --> 00:43:23,706
And we're gonna look at how we do our estimation.

1054
00:43:23,787 --> 00:43:25,387
We're gonna prevent knowledge silos

1055
00:43:25,627 --> 00:43:26,748
in how we work as a team.

1056
00:43:27,849 --> 00:43:29,510
And we're gonna build quality in as we go.

1057
00:43:29,530 --> 00:43:31,431
And we're gonna build one video game together

1058
00:43:31,851 --> 00:43:33,792
and figure out ways to add to the game

1059
00:43:34,632 --> 00:43:35,713
in a way that's not destructive.

1060
00:43:37,853 --> 00:43:39,114
I do want to say that this is possible.

1061
00:43:39,194 --> 00:43:39,794
It's really hard.

1062
00:43:39,874 --> 00:43:42,115
I mean, games are a really brutal industry.

1063
00:43:42,195 --> 00:43:44,376
And frankly, we've lost a lot of great folks

1064
00:43:44,416 --> 00:43:46,517
who have become burned out and left.

1065
00:43:47,357 --> 00:43:49,238
But I do want to say that for myself,

1066
00:43:49,338 --> 00:43:50,999
I've had some great experiences in my career

1067
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:54,260
and some scary ones, but it is important for us

1068
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:56,201
to say that we can do this.

1069
00:43:56,621 --> 00:43:58,262
We can build sustainable environments

1070
00:43:58,522 --> 00:43:59,683
and ship awesome games.

1071
00:44:00,563 --> 00:44:01,683
I do want to talk a little bit about

1072
00:44:01,824 --> 00:44:03,804
how we're trying to embed this in our day-to-day culture

1073
00:44:04,745 --> 00:44:05,865
in terms of how we work as a team.

1074
00:44:07,149 --> 00:44:10,792
I do want to say that value statements can be like really hollow and empty.

1075
00:44:11,613 --> 00:44:15,435
As we started Pragma, I was pretty reticent to have the conversation about values because

1076
00:44:16,656 --> 00:44:17,377
you see these lists.

1077
00:44:17,457 --> 00:44:20,459
Integrity, communication, respect, excellence.

1078
00:44:20,899 --> 00:44:23,821
It's like, yeah, of course I want those things, but that's kind of what I just expect.

1079
00:44:23,921 --> 00:44:25,102
Like those should be table stakes.

1080
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:27,084
That's not very special.

1081
00:44:27,584 --> 00:44:31,987
And Netflix had a culture deck, and in it, they put up those exact culture words.

1082
00:44:32,388 --> 00:44:33,789
And then the next slide points out that that was...

1083
00:44:34,529 --> 00:44:36,652
That was the cultural values of Enron,

1084
00:44:36,773 --> 00:44:38,475
which was this company that famously defrauded

1085
00:44:38,535 --> 00:44:39,036
a ton of people.

1086
00:44:39,862 --> 00:44:42,983
So when we talk about values, I think the best way to do it,

1087
00:44:43,003 --> 00:44:45,945
or at least the way that's effective for us,

1088
00:44:46,365 --> 00:44:47,726
is talk about behaviors.

1089
00:44:47,986 --> 00:44:50,747
You can, if you said, are we excellent?

1090
00:44:50,767 --> 00:44:52,068
I'm like, I don't know, I hope so.

1091
00:44:52,468 --> 00:44:53,809
It's really hard to assess that.

1092
00:44:54,449 --> 00:44:57,391
So we try to define our values as statements of behavior,

1093
00:44:57,851 --> 00:44:59,072
which is like, we do this,

1094
00:44:59,412 --> 00:45:01,293
or we prefer to do it this way over that way.

1095
00:45:01,533 --> 00:45:02,374
That way we can check in.

1096
00:45:02,914 --> 00:45:04,094
These are all aspirational, right?

1097
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:06,616
We're not gonna nail it on our first try.

1098
00:45:07,336 --> 00:45:09,257
So that's just a little bit of framing around values.

1099
00:45:10,839 --> 00:45:12,781
So, the theme is customer triumph.

1100
00:45:13,241 --> 00:45:15,664
Again, this is, for us, we make tools for game developers,

1101
00:45:15,704 --> 00:45:18,508
so it's, we're ultimately, I hope, benefiting players.

1102
00:45:19,569 --> 00:45:21,811
But that's just a bland statement.

1103
00:45:22,412 --> 00:45:24,835
But we talk about a few different behaviors underneath that.

1104
00:45:25,336 --> 00:45:28,699
The first is, we'll prioritize a customer need

1105
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:30,421
over a theoretically perfect system.

1106
00:45:31,075 --> 00:45:32,396
If you've ever worked with any engineers,

1107
00:45:32,896 --> 00:45:36,578
some really like to come up with a grand, perfect plan

1108
00:45:36,878 --> 00:45:39,259
of the most beautiful technology that has ever existed

1109
00:45:39,299 --> 00:45:41,039
in all of history.

1110
00:45:41,860 --> 00:45:42,780
And the problem with that is.

1111
00:45:43,792 --> 00:45:44,492
it's hard to create.

1112
00:45:45,073 --> 00:45:46,194
It's really not very practical.

1113
00:45:46,554 --> 00:45:47,916
So in our case, we have trade-offs to make

1114
00:45:48,156 --> 00:45:49,197
because we're trying to make a product

1115
00:45:49,217 --> 00:45:50,818
that's useful for lots of game studios.

1116
00:45:51,319 --> 00:45:53,661
But at the end of the day, we say we're going to prefer

1117
00:45:53,781 --> 00:45:55,343
to make it work for this one game

1118
00:45:55,703 --> 00:45:56,724
ahead of trying to create something

1119
00:45:56,744 --> 00:45:57,725
that's theoretically ideal.

1120
00:45:57,985 --> 00:45:59,787
And that's something practical we can measure

1121
00:46:00,248 --> 00:46:01,909
because we get to talk to our studios and say,

1122
00:46:01,969 --> 00:46:03,611
hey, are you getting what you need?

1123
00:46:04,131 --> 00:46:05,593
And we had a circumstance in which

1124
00:46:05,633 --> 00:46:06,874
we were trying to create this nice API

1125
00:46:06,894 --> 00:46:08,015
and we had this for crafting.

1126
00:46:08,455 --> 00:46:11,078
And it was basically like, okay, we came up with a few basic crafting scenarios,

1127
00:46:11,118 --> 00:46:13,940
and we built a nice little feature to power that kind of system.

1128
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,622
And then, you know, one of our studios came back and like,

1129
00:46:16,682 --> 00:46:19,464
yeah, but we have this very specific thing that our crafting wants to do.

1130
00:46:19,845 --> 00:46:21,766
And, you know, a couple members of the team were like,

1131
00:46:21,806 --> 00:46:24,949
well, could we just like, tell them to work around it and figure it out themselves?

1132
00:46:25,029 --> 00:46:28,512
Because like, we had this beautiful, like, nice little system.

1133
00:46:28,972 --> 00:46:31,574
But we came back to this value and said, no, we got to unlock what they need.

1134
00:46:31,914 --> 00:46:33,996
And so in that case, we came up with a plan where we had this like...

1135
00:46:34,256 --> 00:46:36,277
powerful version of crafting that was kind of,

1136
00:46:36,918 --> 00:46:37,879
it'll let you do anything,

1137
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:39,760
and it takes a little bit more work from the studio.

1138
00:46:40,060 --> 00:46:42,302
But then we kept our simple crafting system there,

1139
00:46:42,582 --> 00:46:44,403
so that it would be more data-driven and easy

1140
00:46:44,483 --> 00:46:46,484
for the basic cases.

1141
00:46:46,805 --> 00:46:48,225
So in this case, we kind of found a compromise

1142
00:46:48,246 --> 00:46:49,887
where we still want to make great things

1143
00:46:49,907 --> 00:46:50,527
that we're proud of,

1144
00:46:50,987 --> 00:46:52,208
but ultimately we have to measure,

1145
00:46:52,288 --> 00:46:53,929
are we solving a real problem?

1146
00:46:55,410 --> 00:46:56,231
And it's, yeah.

1147
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:58,879
The connection to Crunch, of course,

1148
00:46:58,939 --> 00:47:00,980
is that we don't also want to just spin our wheels

1149
00:47:01,020 --> 00:47:01,821
building a bunch of features

1150
00:47:01,841 --> 00:47:02,961
that nobody ever wants or uses.

1151
00:47:03,722 --> 00:47:04,602
Part of the reason as a company

1152
00:47:04,642 --> 00:47:07,104
we started with a few studios as partners

1153
00:47:07,504 --> 00:47:09,645
was that I wasn't excited about building technology

1154
00:47:09,665 --> 00:47:12,206
for three years and then hoping somebody would like it.

1155
00:47:13,307 --> 00:47:13,947
Quality at speed.

1156
00:47:15,488 --> 00:47:17,850
The trade off between speed and quality is very real.

1157
00:47:20,631 --> 00:47:20,831
You know,

1158
00:47:22,148 --> 00:47:27,492
It's interesting. I think there's two kind of profiles for for engineers and one might be like the cowboy coder that just like

1159
00:47:28,113 --> 00:47:31,095
You know slaps things in really fast, and they're just going you know shooting from the hip

1160
00:47:31,135 --> 00:47:33,517
And then we got all these like problematic ideas around that

1161
00:47:34,818 --> 00:47:36,879
But the important things like speed and just moving fast

1162
00:47:36,939 --> 00:47:41,222
And then we got these like architecture astronauts who just want to plan and plan and plan and right in this comply to game designers

1163
00:47:41,282 --> 00:47:44,285
As well, you know somehow there's like brilliant ideas

1164
00:47:44,345 --> 00:47:50,349
But we never built the game and so we're talking about trying to create a balance of like we want to work on features

1165
00:47:50,891 --> 00:47:53,313
Like on the first day, we want to start working and start building.

1166
00:47:53,693 --> 00:47:55,615
At the same time, we do want to work with discipline

1167
00:47:56,335 --> 00:47:58,797
and make sure that we're building in quality,

1168
00:47:58,817 --> 00:48:02,700
we're reducing silos, and we're integrating all our work together into one.

1169
00:48:02,740 --> 00:48:06,163
Basically everything that we went through as part of the team builder process review.

1170
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:06,823
So...

1171
00:48:07,779 --> 00:48:11,661
At the end of the day, basically what we're trying to express here is that we want to strike a balance

1172
00:48:11,721 --> 00:48:15,243
because we do want to move fast, right? We want to iterate, we want to create, we want to make new things.

1173
00:48:15,623 --> 00:48:19,045
But we also have to keep in mind that we need to make sure that when we build something,

1174
00:48:19,345 --> 00:48:21,787
it's done in the sense that we can actually ship it.

1175
00:48:22,267 --> 00:48:25,969
You know, it's easy to call a feature done and say it kind of works as long as you don't look too closely,

1176
00:48:26,349 --> 00:48:31,072
and suddenly you've got like months and months worth of hardening and bug fixing and stuff

1177
00:48:31,172 --> 00:48:34,113
right at the end of your deadline, right? Nobody ever builds that into the schedule.

1178
00:48:36,291 --> 00:48:39,314
Unlock teams. This is probably the most difficult one, but I think really, really key.

1179
00:48:40,034 --> 00:48:42,337
And the idea is that, you know, we want to...

1180
00:48:43,518 --> 00:48:46,500
We would rather a team build their own solution for a problem

1181
00:48:47,041 --> 00:48:49,343
than we would getting tied up in bureaucracy.

1182
00:48:49,863 --> 00:48:52,746
It can be so difficult if you're at a bigger studio or publisher

1183
00:48:53,307 --> 00:48:55,869
when it feels as though you can't get your work done

1184
00:48:55,949 --> 00:48:58,011
without being on like six different committees.

1185
00:48:58,892 --> 00:49:01,533
and negotiating with 10 or 20 other teams

1186
00:49:01,613 --> 00:49:03,734
to get priority and get the tools you need.

1187
00:49:04,154 --> 00:49:05,635
And so we really talk a lot about,

1188
00:49:06,035 --> 00:49:07,816
if we're going to embody a culture in which we are

1189
00:49:07,876 --> 00:49:09,777
trying to work together and build something healthy,

1190
00:49:10,118 --> 00:49:12,159
we need to create an environment that

1191
00:49:12,259 --> 00:49:15,000
feels safe for people to solve their own problems.

1192
00:49:15,540 --> 00:49:18,162
And again, this happens in games.

1193
00:49:18,182 --> 00:49:19,242
You can have issues with this.

1194
00:49:19,282 --> 00:49:22,004
League of Legends had four different systems

1195
00:49:22,124 --> 00:49:25,045
for measuring time, which made the game extremely

1196
00:49:25,106 --> 00:49:27,207
complex to operate and run because we

1197
00:49:27,227 --> 00:49:27,907
didn't know what happened.

1198
00:49:28,427 --> 00:49:31,068
Worlds in, I think it was season two worlds,

1199
00:49:31,108 --> 00:49:33,169
like the game kept crashing in production

1200
00:49:33,670 --> 00:49:35,710
in like the world championship games

1201
00:49:35,810 --> 00:49:36,751
and we just couldn't stop it.

1202
00:49:37,131 --> 00:49:38,572
So there are real problems that can happen

1203
00:49:38,692 --> 00:49:40,953
if you create a lot of technical debt and messes.

1204
00:49:41,333 --> 00:49:42,854
But at the same time, if you're working on a team,

1205
00:49:42,874 --> 00:49:44,794
you just need to be free to solve your own problems.

1206
00:49:44,814 --> 00:49:46,455
So we absolutely want people to get together

1207
00:49:46,495 --> 00:49:47,856
and create shared solutions,

1208
00:49:48,176 --> 00:49:49,056
but we're not gonna put up a lot

1209
00:49:49,076 --> 00:49:50,477
of artificial boundaries and barriers.

1210
00:49:51,598 --> 00:49:58,163
Our hope is that building up a team of high morale and ownership can help people feel

1211
00:49:58,204 --> 00:50:01,126
like they have control over their destiny and create an environment where we all want

1212
00:50:01,146 --> 00:50:03,028
to show up every day and work on hard problems together.

1213
00:50:05,030 --> 00:50:07,092
So this is just the final bits.

1214
00:50:07,412 --> 00:50:12,356
We did talk about having long-lived teams and not treating people as resources that

1215
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:12,977
we shuffle around.

1216
00:50:14,999 --> 00:50:17,104
you know, one thing we do in terms of team stability

1217
00:50:17,144 --> 00:50:18,207
is we actually give people the chance

1218
00:50:18,227 --> 00:50:19,229
to create their own names.

1219
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:21,535
I worked on a lot of teams where we had to be named

1220
00:50:21,575 --> 00:50:22,497
after the feature we worked on.

1221
00:50:22,884 --> 00:50:24,345
And as soon as our team shipped the feature,

1222
00:50:24,405 --> 00:50:25,466
then our name got changed.

1223
00:50:25,486 --> 00:50:26,707
And it's like, how do you have an identity

1224
00:50:26,747 --> 00:50:27,908
if your name changes all the time?

1225
00:50:28,809 --> 00:50:29,710
It's just really interesting.

1226
00:50:29,770 --> 00:50:31,771
So it's a small thing, but I think it kind of reflects

1227
00:50:31,811 --> 00:50:33,593
that value of saying, no, you're a group.

1228
00:50:34,073 --> 00:50:38,376
A lot of us have picked different gods from,

1229
00:50:38,396 --> 00:50:40,378
I mean, we were all playing Hades at the time,

1230
00:50:40,418 --> 00:50:41,759
so a lot of people picked different, you know.

1231
00:50:42,039 --> 00:50:43,480
But importantly, they're arbitrary names.

1232
00:50:43,500 --> 00:50:44,842
They don't mean anything other than just

1233
00:50:44,962 --> 00:50:46,183
that that's the name of the team.

1234
00:50:46,483 --> 00:50:48,965
It's really fun.

1235
00:50:49,065 --> 00:50:50,826
We do not do individual performance reviews.

1236
00:50:51,866 --> 00:50:54,067
This is like sacred for most companies,

1237
00:50:54,187 --> 00:50:56,029
but there's a lot of harm that can come from it.

1238
00:50:56,469 --> 00:50:57,350
And at the end of the day, it's like,

1239
00:50:57,850 --> 00:50:59,711
as a business, we wanna know that we have healthy teams.

1240
00:50:59,832 --> 00:51:00,872
And so we can look at the team and say,

1241
00:51:00,892 --> 00:51:02,013
are they shipping, are they delivering,

1242
00:51:02,053 --> 00:51:03,194
are they doing what they need to do?

1243
00:51:03,755 --> 00:51:05,416
And we can trust them to self-manage.

1244
00:51:05,456 --> 00:51:06,617
If somebody on the team is struggling,

1245
00:51:07,017 --> 00:51:08,378
we hope that they get coaching and development.

1246
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,400
But at the end of the day, we can just say,

1247
00:51:10,860 --> 00:51:13,862
we expect the team to deliver and do great things,

1248
00:51:14,122 --> 00:51:15,563
and we'll let them manage themselves.

1249
00:51:15,744 --> 00:51:17,885
It's really empowering, we think and we hope.

1250
00:51:19,803 --> 00:51:21,246
You know, we do have a flexible PTO.

1251
00:51:21,266 --> 00:51:22,447
This is one thing that comes up though,

1252
00:51:22,487 --> 00:51:24,270
is like, hey, maybe people feel afraid.

1253
00:51:24,530 --> 00:51:26,173
Again, some of that gets into the siloing stuff

1254
00:51:26,193 --> 00:51:28,075
we talked about, but my co-founder and I,

1255
00:51:28,095 --> 00:51:30,178
we do take time off, and we put it on the company calendar.

1256
00:51:30,198 --> 00:51:32,362
We let that be visible to people so that they can see.

1257
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:33,663
It's safe to take time.

1258
00:51:34,732 --> 00:51:38,454
You know, we do remote work. It's hard, though, because I think being in person can be really valuable, too.

1259
00:51:38,474 --> 00:51:41,176
So we actually try to be really encouraging of if people want to get together

1260
00:51:41,196 --> 00:51:43,497
and work in person, we absolutely support that.

1261
00:51:43,857 --> 00:51:46,299
But we're remote first because of the flexibility it provides and

1262
00:51:46,639 --> 00:51:48,420
the fact that we've obviously been in pandemic.

1263
00:51:48,460 --> 00:51:50,361
But we're trying to embrace that and really invest in the tools.

1264
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:54,463
You know, Discord has one really great feature, which is you have persistent voice channels.

1265
00:51:54,583 --> 00:51:56,144
And so it actually is a fundamental difference.

1266
00:51:56,224 --> 00:51:58,165
If people are already in channels throughout the workday,

1267
00:51:58,605 --> 00:52:00,787
then dropping in is not all this friction and slack of like...

1268
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:04,871
should we make a call, should we make a call, Zoom, Google, Hangouts, like Slack calls, you know.

1269
00:52:05,391 --> 00:52:09,035
So there's small things that we try to do, but it tries to make it feel like there's some actual

1270
00:52:09,075 --> 00:52:13,620
presence. You know, we're remote, but we try to make it so that communicating is as frictionless

1271
00:52:13,660 --> 00:52:14,200
as we can get it.

1272
00:52:15,379 --> 00:52:16,320
Sustainable hours, you know.

1273
00:52:16,340 --> 00:52:18,943
I mean, at the end of the day,

1274
00:52:18,963 --> 00:52:20,705
we just have to make a decision about what we're doing.

1275
00:52:20,765 --> 00:52:23,227
I think games are so, so complex.

1276
00:52:23,768 --> 00:52:25,349
There's a lot of domains in which

1277
00:52:26,150 --> 00:52:28,172
working harder just produces more output.

1278
00:52:28,452 --> 00:52:31,095
In games, we can literally destroy value, right?

1279
00:52:31,215 --> 00:52:32,997
If you can break a bunch of things, create crashes,

1280
00:52:33,037 --> 00:52:34,198
you can take whole teams offline.

1281
00:52:34,859 --> 00:52:37,984
We recognize that when you're doing really complex work,

1282
00:52:38,445 --> 00:52:40,228
it's worth protecting people's health

1283
00:52:40,688 --> 00:52:42,772
so that they can actually continue building over time

1284
00:52:43,192 --> 00:52:45,216
and not creating huge problems that end up

1285
00:52:45,256 --> 00:52:47,299
becoming something we have to chase and catch up with.

1286
00:52:50,738 --> 00:52:52,739
Here's a list of resources, you know,

1287
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:54,821
these just are scratching the surface.

1288
00:52:54,861 --> 00:52:56,681
There's fantastic books and talks out there

1289
00:52:57,102 --> 00:52:59,043
about a lot of these ideas, Agile processes,

1290
00:52:59,783 --> 00:53:01,484
organizational health, and I highly encourage you

1291
00:53:01,504 --> 00:53:03,385
to invest in the leadership and communication stuff

1292
00:53:03,425 --> 00:53:05,106
because it can be really useful to learn

1293
00:53:05,146 --> 00:53:07,687
how to be an effective communicator as part of your teams.

1294
00:53:08,607 --> 00:53:13,310
So absolutely, you know, just spend time learning

1295
00:53:13,330 --> 00:53:14,390
and growing in these different areas.

1296
00:53:15,250 --> 00:53:18,332
This does conclude the talk. I really appreciate everyone for taking the time to be here.

1297
00:53:18,852 --> 00:53:21,513
We do have a booth at the expo, so we'd love you to stop by and say hi.

1298
00:53:21,533 --> 00:53:25,956
I will be at Alcove 305 here in the South Hall for 15-20 minutes afterwards,

1299
00:53:26,016 --> 00:53:30,918
so please come by and talk more. Thank you very much. And that's it.

1300
00:53:40,242 --> 00:53:43,644
We've got about six minutes for questions if anyone. I think we've got a...

1301
00:53:44,300 --> 00:53:44,960
Mic up here.

1302
00:53:45,301 --> 00:53:46,641
Looks like we got one on either side.

1303
00:53:46,661 --> 00:53:50,825
Hello.

1304
00:53:51,485 --> 00:53:56,789
You were talking about pair programming and I was wondering how do you do that when you

1305
00:53:56,869 --> 00:53:58,330
are working from home?

1306
00:53:58,350 --> 00:54:02,193
Yeah, pair programming from home?

1307
00:54:02,213 --> 00:54:02,833
Yeah.

1308
00:54:02,853 --> 00:54:02,933
Yeah.

1309
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:03,033
Yeah.

1310
00:54:03,053 --> 00:54:03,133
Yeah.

1311
00:54:03,153 --> 00:54:03,234
Yeah.

1312
00:54:03,254 --> 00:54:03,434
Yeah.

1313
00:54:03,454 --> 00:54:03,534
Yeah.

1314
00:54:03,554 --> 00:54:03,634
Yeah.

1315
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:03,734
Yeah.

1316
00:54:03,754 --> 00:54:03,834
Yeah.

1317
00:54:03,854 --> 00:54:03,934
Yeah.

1318
00:54:04,301 --> 00:54:05,162
Yeah, it's a lot harder.

1319
00:54:05,642 --> 00:54:06,783
I mean, we do use a bunch,

1320
00:54:06,803 --> 00:54:09,124
we've tried a lot of different screen sharing technologies,

1321
00:54:09,184 --> 00:54:10,405
but there are some that are dedicated

1322
00:54:10,465 --> 00:54:11,306
for just screen sharing.

1323
00:54:11,326 --> 00:54:13,787
If you're using a video call feature to do a screen share,

1324
00:54:14,188 --> 00:54:15,468
they're not very well optimized.

1325
00:54:16,049 --> 00:54:17,370
So there's a few tools out there.

1326
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,491
You know, there's one called Pop and Drovio,

1327
00:54:19,531 --> 00:54:21,833
there's TeamViewer, but I would look for the ones

1328
00:54:21,873 --> 00:54:24,414
that are very specifically meant for doing screen share

1329
00:54:24,515 --> 00:54:25,935
and not the ones that are just general,

1330
00:54:26,076 --> 00:54:27,216
like video chat apps.

1331
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:28,777
It is tough, but other than that,

1332
00:54:28,837 --> 00:54:30,318
it's just being on that Discord call

1333
00:54:30,418 --> 00:54:32,060
and then using the screen sharing tools.

1334
00:54:33,099 --> 00:54:35,801
Okay, thanks. Just one other quickly.

1335
00:54:37,423 --> 00:54:41,766
How do you ask your co-workers to pair program with you

1336
00:54:41,987 --> 00:54:47,431
without making them feel like they don't know what they are doing

1337
00:54:47,651 --> 00:54:51,675
or like a burden to you or maybe you being a burden to them?

1338
00:54:53,022 --> 00:54:54,364
Yeah, that's a great question.

1339
00:54:54,564 --> 00:54:57,447
And yeah, it's a lot to sit down next to somebody

1340
00:54:57,467 --> 00:54:58,909
and work together every day.

1341
00:54:59,209 --> 00:55:00,410
There's a lot of social pressure.

1342
00:55:00,590 --> 00:55:02,933
And we try to make that, I mean,

1343
00:55:03,033 --> 00:55:05,095
one, we're very vocal about that culture up front,

1344
00:55:05,175 --> 00:55:07,197
just hoping that people are willing to give it a try.

1345
00:55:07,258 --> 00:55:08,579
And we try to set that expectation

1346
00:55:08,619 --> 00:55:09,520
and make people feel safe.

1347
00:55:10,701 --> 00:55:12,481
In practice, I mean, obviously, again,

1348
00:55:12,541 --> 00:55:14,682
some of that comes to having the humility

1349
00:55:14,742 --> 00:55:16,103
and just being kind to people.

1350
00:55:16,983 --> 00:55:19,304
If people give it a chance, oftentimes you'll find

1351
00:55:19,324 --> 00:55:20,944
that like, oh, there's no mystery.

1352
00:55:21,345 --> 00:55:22,545
Everybody else is also, you know,

1353
00:55:22,585 --> 00:55:24,206
scratching their head and making mistakes.

1354
00:55:24,646 --> 00:55:26,186
And so if people give it a chance,

1355
00:55:26,286 --> 00:55:28,067
oftentimes I think they can see and learn

1356
00:55:28,107 --> 00:55:29,648
that it's okay to not know the answer.

1357
00:55:29,688 --> 00:55:31,448
And actually it's a really fun problem solving

1358
00:55:31,488 --> 00:55:32,909
to actually do it side by side.

1359
00:55:33,649 --> 00:55:36,070
But there is a real hurdle of getting people to start.

1360
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:38,611
And so the best you can do is just kind of invite that

1361
00:55:38,631 --> 00:55:40,232
and ask people to give it a shot.

1362
00:55:40,452 --> 00:55:42,233
And you do want to make it as safe as you can.

1363
00:55:43,953 --> 00:55:46,034
Cycling through, if you're pairing with the same person

1364
00:55:46,054 --> 00:55:47,295
for weeks or months, that can be really tough.

1365
00:55:47,475 --> 00:55:50,116
So also having a little bit of a schedule can help too.

1366
00:55:50,696 --> 00:55:51,576
Okay, thank you.

1367
00:55:54,558 --> 00:55:57,819
Hi, this is a great talk on the pair programming

1368
00:55:57,839 --> 00:55:58,779
since we're going off that.

1369
00:55:59,340 --> 00:56:00,720
How often do

1370
00:56:01,821 --> 00:56:06,386
repair program. Do they do it all the time? Would you do the start of a feature and then kind of break off?

1371
00:56:07,373 --> 00:56:09,114
Yeah, our team is quite extreme,

1372
00:56:09,174 --> 00:56:11,955
so we basically will pair more or less full-time,

1373
00:56:12,516 --> 00:56:13,996
but I don't think teams have to go that length

1374
00:56:14,076 --> 00:56:14,877
to get value from it.

1375
00:56:14,957 --> 00:56:17,438
I do think at the outset of establishing

1376
00:56:17,498 --> 00:56:19,839
new foundations and patterns can be a really great thing.

1377
00:56:19,859 --> 00:56:21,620
You know, there's this idea of mobbing,

1378
00:56:21,640 --> 00:56:23,160
where you actually have more than two people

1379
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:23,901
working on a problem.

1380
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:25,922
I think that that's a very hard thing to sustain,

1381
00:56:25,982 --> 00:56:28,883
because it's hard to pay attention if you're not in it.

1382
00:56:29,523 --> 00:56:30,664
But when you're setting up, you know,

1383
00:56:31,084 --> 00:56:32,825
breaking new ground, that can be a great time

1384
00:56:32,865 --> 00:56:34,545
to kind of try to get everyone on the same page

1385
00:56:34,585 --> 00:56:35,106
from the outset.

1386
00:56:35,586 --> 00:56:37,066
So I think that that is a great place to start.

1387
00:56:41,346 --> 00:56:42,166
Hi, great talk.

1388
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:45,047
I had a question about the scheduling.

1389
00:56:45,167 --> 00:56:47,307
So you had a slide where you're like,

1390
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:48,887
forget this, this doesn't work,

1391
00:56:48,907 --> 00:56:51,348
you don't have story one, story two,

1392
00:56:51,488 --> 00:56:54,048
you have overlapping stories.

1393
00:56:54,168 --> 00:56:56,188
And so my question about that is,

1394
00:56:56,288 --> 00:57:00,669
how can you plan that sort of schedule with dependencies?

1395
00:57:01,709 --> 00:57:03,210
Yeah, so this is something that there's like,

1396
00:57:03,590 --> 00:57:05,150
pure Agile theory that says like,

1397
00:57:05,210 --> 00:57:07,810
just don't have dependencies, which is ridiculous.

1398
00:57:07,890 --> 00:57:09,231
Like it just doesn't happen that way.

1399
00:57:09,751 --> 00:57:10,091
And so.

1400
00:57:12,218 --> 00:57:13,719
I mean, one way to think about that is,

1401
00:57:13,919 --> 00:57:15,120
you're probably gonna have a through line

1402
00:57:15,140 --> 00:57:16,161
of who's working on what,

1403
00:57:16,562 --> 00:57:19,525
and so that sequencing is gonna be somewhat natural

1404
00:57:19,605 --> 00:57:20,686
in the sense that clearly,

1405
00:57:20,786 --> 00:57:22,728
if one thing has to come before the next,

1406
00:57:23,529 --> 00:57:25,050
especially again, we have the pairing thing,

1407
00:57:25,070 --> 00:57:26,732
but we will try to have a through line,

1408
00:57:26,752 --> 00:57:28,033
meaning one person might stay on

1409
00:57:28,073 --> 00:57:29,755
and they have pairs rotating in and out.

1410
00:57:30,175 --> 00:57:31,636
And so, at the end of the day,

1411
00:57:32,497 --> 00:57:35,200
You get into certain theories where they get into swim lanes,

1412
00:57:35,220 --> 00:57:37,982
and it's like, oh, we have all these different threads of execution at once.

1413
00:57:38,602 --> 00:57:40,964
The only caution about going really hard on that front

1414
00:57:41,245 --> 00:57:43,487
is that that very quickly turns into very siloed work,

1415
00:57:43,647 --> 00:57:45,568
where everybody has one assignment on their own lane,

1416
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:47,950
and then everything's just going at its own different pace.

1417
00:57:48,551 --> 00:57:52,794
So, it's reasonable to think about swim lanes in terms of like,

1418
00:57:52,875 --> 00:57:56,418
okay, but there is a through line of this kind of shared thing with dependencies.

1419
00:57:56,858 --> 00:57:57,639
But I would say that...

1420
00:57:58,638 --> 00:58:01,499
Try to make that a little bit more the exception,

1421
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:02,919
in the sense you still want it to feel like

1422
00:58:02,979 --> 00:58:05,620
the whole team is solving the main priorities together.

1423
00:58:06,301 --> 00:58:07,701
And then if you have to deal with,

1424
00:58:07,721 --> 00:58:08,821
I mean basically it's just saying,

1425
00:58:08,962 --> 00:58:10,682
yeah you will have that, be aware of it.

1426
00:58:11,002 --> 00:58:13,003
Try not to get yourself in a circumstance if you can,

1427
00:58:13,443 --> 00:58:16,304
where you've got like three hard dependency

1428
00:58:16,544 --> 00:58:18,605
separate threads, because then it gets really siloed.

1429
00:58:18,765 --> 00:58:20,606
So I don't know if that helps all the way, but.

1430
00:58:20,626 --> 00:58:22,546
I appreciate it, thank you.

1431
00:58:22,706 --> 00:58:22,906
Thank you.

1432
00:58:25,006 --> 00:58:26,507
Hi, I really enjoy the talk.

1433
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:31,269
I run a startup with several people working alongside me

1434
00:58:31,329 --> 00:58:33,309
on a game we've been working on for a few years.

1435
00:58:33,349 --> 00:58:35,931
And we have kind of developed a crunch culture

1436
00:58:35,991 --> 00:58:38,312
just because we have such a lack of resources

1437
00:58:38,332 --> 00:58:41,333
that it feels like every update really is important.

1438
00:58:41,353 --> 00:58:44,994
We don't have any backing or anything, so it's super big.

1439
00:58:45,214 --> 00:58:47,435
I mean, I'm, as the director of the whole project,

1440
00:58:47,475 --> 00:58:49,936
I'm obviously responsible for this sort of culture, but...

1441
00:58:50,517 --> 00:58:51,577
I wonder, is there a balance?

1442
00:58:51,597 --> 00:58:54,759
Because there are some times where it's like, no, this is a really critical time.

1443
00:58:54,779 --> 00:58:57,060
Like you might need to come in on a weekend and work.

1444
00:58:57,140 --> 00:58:59,941
And I mean, is some of that acceptable or.

1445
00:59:00,982 --> 00:59:03,223
Yeah, I mean, again, I think we all do this because we love it.

1446
00:59:03,743 --> 00:59:06,184
And if I said that I never like worked late in my career,

1447
00:59:06,204 --> 00:59:09,065
I think that would be pretty, pretty false.

1448
00:59:09,566 --> 00:59:13,588
I think the question there are two things that you have to account for as a team,

1449
00:59:13,668 --> 00:59:15,348
which one is sustainability, which is like.

1450
00:59:15,671 --> 00:59:17,913
This may work, may work for six months or a year,

1451
00:59:18,434 --> 00:59:20,296
but are people slowly getting burned out

1452
00:59:20,316 --> 00:59:22,318
to the point where they're ultimately gonna have to quit

1453
00:59:22,358 --> 00:59:23,659
or leave the project or move on?

1454
00:59:24,119 --> 00:59:25,321
And so you really have to weigh that.

1455
00:59:25,401 --> 00:59:26,542
So the question becomes like,

1456
00:59:26,882 --> 00:59:29,685
are you genuinely pushing in a moment and in a time

1457
00:59:29,705 --> 00:59:30,305
where it's just like, hey.

1458
00:59:30,906 --> 00:59:32,847
you know, this is key to what we're doing.

1459
00:59:33,808 --> 00:59:35,809
Because there have been times where I've been in the room

1460
00:59:35,829 --> 00:59:37,490
with folks under some kind of crisis,

1461
00:59:37,770 --> 00:59:39,231
and there can be some camaraderie built.

1462
00:59:39,631 --> 00:59:41,172
But if you're trying to sustain that every day,

1463
00:59:41,192 --> 00:59:42,012
I think it's really tough.

1464
00:59:42,833 --> 00:59:44,454
And one thing, you know, I was actually talking to

1465
00:59:45,334 --> 00:59:46,895
somebody on the plane over to GDC,

1466
00:59:46,935 --> 00:59:48,376
and he asked about like publisher pressure,

1467
00:59:48,416 --> 00:59:50,197
and he's like, well, what if they cancel your team

1468
00:59:50,237 --> 00:59:51,057
and your project's done?

1469
00:59:51,558 --> 00:59:52,198
And so, you know,

1470
00:59:53,827 --> 00:59:56,768
One thought there is that you have to have a steady state

1471
00:59:56,928 --> 00:59:59,009
so that you can push when you need to,

1472
00:59:59,610 --> 01:00:01,671
and you hope that pushing becomes an opt-in part

1473
01:00:01,691 --> 01:00:03,812
of the passionate team choosing to do so

1474
01:00:03,952 --> 01:00:05,393
with intentionality and a plan.

1475
01:00:05,933 --> 01:00:06,873
I've seen teams that are just like,

1476
01:00:06,893 --> 01:00:09,675
well, we're gonna go eight or nine hours a day.

1477
01:00:09,715 --> 01:00:11,255
They're not pushing crazy on hours,

1478
01:00:11,556 --> 01:00:12,616
but they're locked in.

1479
01:00:12,636 --> 01:00:15,197
They're like, we're gonna schedule lunch very precisely,

1480
01:00:15,257 --> 01:00:17,459
and we're gonna be here in our seats committed.

1481
01:00:17,759 --> 01:00:19,980
And even that can actually be hard to sustain,

1482
01:00:20,340 --> 01:00:21,541
but you can get a lot from

1483
01:00:22,361 --> 01:00:24,262
being more kind of disciplined in the moment,

1484
01:00:24,522 --> 01:00:26,584
but if you don't have any pressure like release,

1485
01:00:26,724 --> 01:00:29,365
then I think ultimately it's just gonna be rough.

1486
01:00:29,886 --> 01:00:32,587
And so I don't know how useful that advice is,

1487
01:00:32,647 --> 01:00:33,988
but I would just say, of course,

1488
01:00:34,028 --> 01:00:35,529
there will be a time and a moment where you're just like,

1489
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:36,930
well, but I gotta get this thing done.

1490
01:00:37,310 --> 01:00:39,191
But really ask yourself, is this an exception?

1491
01:00:39,631 --> 01:00:40,772
And are the people who are there,

1492
01:00:40,872 --> 01:00:43,674
do they have the capacity to try to make this thing

1493
01:00:43,694 --> 01:00:45,475
come to life, because they want to make it real.

1494
01:00:45,595 --> 01:00:47,976
And they've had the safety and the, you know,

1495
01:00:49,397 --> 01:00:50,138
with the day to day.

1496
01:00:50,918 --> 01:00:51,158
Thank you.

1497
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:58,723
Thanks for the talk. I had a couple questions. One of them is regarding the discovery work.

1498
01:00:59,384 --> 01:01:04,409
So you mentioned that when reaching a deadline you should basically have less and less

1499
01:01:04,449 --> 01:01:08,693
discovery work. So should you go to like a nice to have backlog or something?

1500
01:01:09,854 --> 01:01:12,998
Yeah, absolutely. Right. And that gets like

1501
01:01:14,144 --> 01:01:16,006
Games are so creative, so it's like sometimes

1502
01:01:16,046 --> 01:01:18,229
the funnest things happen because somebody put it in there

1503
01:01:18,249 --> 01:01:19,651
because they were just really excited about it.

1504
01:01:20,071 --> 01:01:21,793
And so I think having that kind of nice to have,

1505
01:01:22,114 --> 01:01:23,195
there will be moments in time,

1506
01:01:23,556 --> 01:01:24,977
again, some of this gets to dependencies.

1507
01:01:25,057 --> 01:01:26,840
Sometimes you got really critical stuff that's kind of.

1508
01:01:27,491 --> 01:01:29,792
is single threaded, you can't work on it in parallel.

1509
01:01:30,172 --> 01:01:31,712
And so that, you know, there's an opportunity

1510
01:01:31,732 --> 01:01:33,612
to pull in some less lower priority work

1511
01:01:33,813 --> 01:01:35,793
that just polishes things out and makes it nice to have.

1512
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:37,633
So, you know, I think it's critical

1513
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:39,174
to have a prioritized backlog.

1514
01:01:39,214 --> 01:01:41,114
You have to know what's most important in order.

1515
01:01:41,694 --> 01:01:43,655
But that doesn't mean you're not gonna go deeper

1516
01:01:43,695 --> 01:01:44,895
in the list and pull something up

1517
01:01:44,995 --> 01:01:46,936
because it happens to fit who's available

1518
01:01:46,976 --> 01:01:48,136
at the moment or what, you know.

1519
01:01:48,916 --> 01:01:50,097
So it's a dynamic.

1520
01:01:50,497 --> 01:01:51,539
thing, so absolutely.

1521
01:01:52,240 --> 01:01:54,283
Sometimes those become graveyards, and that's okay.

1522
01:01:54,323 --> 01:01:56,346
Like, accept that those things are probably

1523
01:01:56,406 --> 01:01:58,670
not gonna get done, but sometimes there is those

1524
01:01:58,770 --> 01:02:00,573
like, really interesting little, you know,

1525
01:02:01,114 --> 01:02:02,596
nice to haves that people will just put in

1526
01:02:02,636 --> 01:02:03,478
because they've got, you know,

1527
01:02:03,498 --> 01:02:04,880
time in between larger efforts.

1528
01:02:05,397 --> 01:02:10,780
OK, and then the next question is regarding pair programming.

1529
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:14,582
Do you mean actual streaming one dude typing

1530
01:02:14,622 --> 01:02:15,803
and the other one looking at it?

1531
01:02:16,063 --> 01:02:18,184
Or is it more like a code review?

1532
01:02:18,204 --> 01:02:21,306
Like I'll submit this PR, or I'll work on this feature,

1533
01:02:21,386 --> 01:02:24,448
or this tech doc in which we'll plan together and then

1534
01:02:25,608 --> 01:02:26,569
proceed to build it together?

1535
01:02:27,029 --> 01:02:34,113
Yeah, so I mean we do like full pair programming in which we actually are coding together and switching between who's kind of driving and

1536
01:02:34,513 --> 01:02:39,916
Obviously having that whiteboard session doing some planning together can still be totally effective. So right we do some of that as well

1537
01:02:40,857 --> 01:02:42,117
So it just kind of depends

1538
01:02:42,157 --> 01:02:47,200
I think what you don't get though when you do a review or a whiteboard sketch is that you don't get two

1539
01:02:47,460 --> 01:02:52,303
Experts in the system. You're still gonna have that knowledge silo. So, you know, it is a trade-off again

1540
01:02:52,343 --> 01:02:54,944
I'm not being hyper prescriptive saying you have to do it this way, but

1541
01:02:55,244 --> 01:02:58,969
So truly doing the work together is the way that you walk away with two experts.

1542
01:02:59,990 --> 01:03:02,554
And doing those collaborations and code reviews, again, can help.

1543
01:03:02,614 --> 01:03:03,895
They can create some knowledge sharing.

1544
01:03:03,915 --> 01:03:05,257
So they're absolutely useful as well.

1545
01:03:05,898 --> 01:03:06,158
Thank you.

1546
01:03:09,093 --> 01:03:16,939
Thank you for the talk. At the very end, you were talking about some of the cultural, I guess, statements that your company has been going through.

1547
01:03:16,959 --> 01:03:33,392
But you didn't talk about the process of developing those as more like, just like how did you structure those conversations and those organization points to like, decide, oh, this point needs to be refined, or this point is missing the general goal of this cultural statement.

1548
01:03:33,937 --> 01:03:37,439
Yeah, I don't think I listed it in the resources,

1549
01:03:37,499 --> 01:03:39,180
but the book I mentioned at the outset,

1550
01:03:39,580 --> 01:03:41,302
Pat Lencioni's The Advantage,

1551
01:03:41,682 --> 01:03:43,483
it's actually a super practical framework

1552
01:03:43,863 --> 01:03:45,084
for building company culture,

1553
01:03:45,104 --> 01:03:48,006
and it gives you some very nice advice about like,

1554
01:03:48,046 --> 01:03:50,388
here, you know, like, go do it like this.

1555
01:03:50,508 --> 01:03:52,709
And so there's some different activities that, you know,

1556
01:03:52,769 --> 01:03:54,150
none of them are crazy, but it's like,

1557
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,172
we all got in a room, we all kind of put together

1558
01:03:56,192 --> 01:03:58,333
our own cluster of ideas and conversations

1559
01:03:58,433 --> 01:03:59,794
and then talked about it as a leadership group.

1560
01:04:00,174 --> 01:04:01,115
It has to be living.

1561
01:04:01,215 --> 01:04:03,196
So we have a literal Google Doc with our,

1562
01:04:03,576 --> 01:04:04,717
it's called the company playbook,

1563
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:07,039
and those values are in there, and we change them, right?

1564
01:04:07,059 --> 01:04:07,839
And we talk about them.

1565
01:04:07,939 --> 01:04:10,361
And we do a weekly all hands, and I will kind of,

1566
01:04:10,801 --> 01:04:12,262
spend some time with the team saying like,

1567
01:04:12,342 --> 01:04:13,403
oh, here's what I observed this week.

1568
01:04:13,443 --> 01:04:16,386
Like, hey, we saw that some folks helped this game studio

1569
01:04:16,646 --> 01:04:17,667
and kind of went above and beyond.

1570
01:04:17,687 --> 01:04:19,249
We're like, hey, that's the customer success.

1571
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,831
So talking about it every week makes it way more real

1572
01:04:22,212 --> 01:04:23,633
than most of what I've experienced,

1573
01:04:23,673 --> 01:04:25,274
which is we have these four bullet points

1574
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:27,657
that we write down once, nobody ever looks at them again.

1575
01:04:28,477 --> 01:04:29,298
So that can be really helpful.

1576
01:04:29,518 --> 01:04:30,699
Yeah, that's the thing we're really hoping

1577
01:04:30,719 --> 01:04:31,740
to avoid moving forward.

1578
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:32,621
So thank you for sharing that.

1579
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:34,963
Yeah, the weekly, yeah,

1580
01:04:35,003 --> 01:04:37,125
all hands has been a really cool way to talk about it.

1581
01:04:37,815 --> 01:04:39,637
And sometimes we do talk about it in the negative,

1582
01:04:39,697 --> 01:04:41,498
like, oh, we said we'd do it like this,

1583
01:04:41,598 --> 01:04:43,700
but the unlocked teams is hard, right?

1584
01:04:43,801 --> 01:04:45,682
Because we want coordination, too.

1585
01:04:46,363 --> 01:04:46,643
Thank you.

1586
01:04:47,144 --> 01:04:47,344
Thank you.

1587
01:04:48,453 --> 01:04:49,013
Thanks for the talk.

1588
01:04:49,774 --> 01:04:50,574
I'll ask you something.

1589
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:54,997
How to avoid knowledge silos in leadership positions and places?

1590
01:04:55,017 --> 01:05:01,361
And also when you are, for example, like I've seen many companies, especially smaller ones,

1591
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:05,083
in which leaders crunch so that the production team won't have to crunch.

1592
01:05:06,444 --> 01:05:10,026
So how to share this with the team without it being a burden to anyone involved in the

1593
01:05:10,066 --> 01:05:10,386
process?

1594
01:05:11,042 --> 01:05:16,924
Yeah, I think that this is probably the hairiest part of the conversation that we don't go deep on.

1595
01:05:18,124 --> 01:05:20,105
There's a couple different things that I'll think about.

1596
01:05:20,165 --> 01:05:25,207
And part of it too is, now that I'm a lot further away, I'm not writing code every day.

1597
01:05:26,267 --> 01:05:27,528
The two things I'll keep in mind are...

1598
01:05:29,058 --> 01:05:30,639
you know, across your leadership team,

1599
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:33,201
one, you do have to have intentional processes and plans.

1600
01:05:33,241 --> 01:05:35,023
Like, we have to get together and talk about things.

1601
01:05:35,103 --> 01:05:36,424
But of course, you know, I think we all have

1602
01:05:36,484 --> 01:05:37,385
some kind of meetings.

1603
01:05:38,385 --> 01:05:39,006
There's a couple things.

1604
01:05:39,246 --> 01:05:40,607
So one, there is this idea of like,

1605
01:05:40,627 --> 01:05:42,168
what if you paired on other stuff too?

1606
01:05:42,308 --> 01:05:43,650
Which is an interesting one.

1607
01:05:43,670 --> 01:05:45,391
I can't say I've ever totally tried that.

1608
01:05:45,951 --> 01:05:47,973
But it is like how we're trying to build

1609
01:05:47,993 --> 01:05:49,374
our cultural statements and values.

1610
01:05:49,474 --> 01:05:53,017
So we do two day off sites with the leadership team

1611
01:05:53,037 --> 01:05:55,118
to really sit down and talk at length

1612
01:05:55,178 --> 01:05:56,659
about what's important for the business

1613
01:05:56,699 --> 01:05:59,161
and how do we run our teams and who needs help and support.

1614
01:05:59,642 --> 01:06:02,664
And I know that none of those are very tactically valuable.

1615
01:06:02,724 --> 01:06:05,766
So I guess when we bring it back to running a team

1616
01:06:05,886 --> 01:06:07,988
and then maybe leadership not being connected to that,

1617
01:06:08,388 --> 01:06:10,630
what I will say, and it kind of came up in the story

1618
01:06:10,690 --> 01:06:12,752
about the crunch conversation at the outset

1619
01:06:12,772 --> 01:06:13,852
of the Team Builder Project was,

1620
01:06:14,693 --> 01:06:16,634
if you're a leader and you can't see the team

1621
01:06:16,654 --> 01:06:18,456
working every day, there is a lot of fear

1622
01:06:18,636 --> 01:06:19,696
that a leader is gonna have,

1623
01:06:19,777 --> 01:06:22,558
because they can't watch the team running and operating.

1624
01:06:22,979 --> 01:06:24,340
And so there is a lot of work you can do,

1625
01:06:24,580 --> 01:06:26,121
especially if you're a frontline lead.

1626
01:06:27,282 --> 01:06:29,884
Try to make the team's efforts and experiments

1627
01:06:30,064 --> 01:06:32,746
and iterations visible, and that takes extra work.

1628
01:06:32,786 --> 01:06:34,627
So I'm not gonna say that that comes for free,

1629
01:06:34,927 --> 01:06:36,788
but I will say, I've seen it both,

1630
01:06:37,289 --> 01:06:39,210
we now have VCs and investors,

1631
01:06:39,750 --> 01:06:41,312
and we have a board member who shows up

1632
01:06:41,372 --> 01:06:42,072
once every three months.

1633
01:06:42,132 --> 01:06:43,633
They can't see what's happening at the company.

1634
01:06:44,094 --> 01:06:45,634
So there's real work you can do

1635
01:06:45,694 --> 01:06:47,355
to try to make the team's work visible.

1636
01:06:47,635 --> 01:06:48,736
And I do think that that can create

1637
01:06:48,756 --> 01:06:49,977
a lot more safety and trust.

1638
01:06:50,317 --> 01:06:51,337
I mean, a lot of us have lived

1639
01:06:51,357 --> 01:06:52,658
the bad publisher relationship

1640
01:06:52,698 --> 01:06:54,499
where the publisher shows up once every three months,

1641
01:06:54,519 --> 01:06:55,339
six months, and they're just like,

1642
01:06:55,720 --> 01:06:57,340
show me all those features you committed to.

1643
01:06:57,380 --> 01:06:58,941
And you're like, we're trying to build a video game

1644
01:06:58,961 --> 01:07:00,142
and it can get really difficult.

1645
01:07:00,482 --> 01:07:02,163
So I do think, not easy,

1646
01:07:02,443 --> 01:07:06,445
but you put time and energy in making your work visible,

1647
01:07:06,645 --> 01:07:08,046
even the failed experiments, right?

1648
01:07:08,486 --> 01:07:09,607
Even the stuff that didn't work

1649
01:07:09,727 --> 01:07:11,308
because then it makes it a little bit more real.

1650
01:07:11,328 --> 01:07:12,728
Thank you.

1651
01:07:15,050 --> 01:07:18,232
Alright, I think we're over time, so let's do this as the last one.

1652
01:07:19,453 --> 01:07:19,913
Thanks Chris.

1653
01:07:20,914 --> 01:07:24,997
So I was hoping you could talk one more time about the keeping teams together and some

1654
01:07:25,017 --> 01:07:26,358
of the team switching points that you made.

1655
01:07:26,878 --> 01:07:33,103
So in some of my recent experience, we have had some team switching and that's been largely

1656
01:07:33,143 --> 01:07:38,347
based on like moving from milestone to milestone or feature to feature and those have kind

1657
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:44,051
of required different resources or different groupings of people together.

1658
01:07:44,492 --> 01:07:48,963
I was wondering, you know, from your perspective, is that always a flaw in the planning or is

1659
01:07:48,983 --> 01:07:51,971
that a necessary kind of just step in the development phase?

1660
01:07:52,934 --> 01:07:54,254
Yeah, I think that's a great call out.

1661
01:07:54,274 --> 01:07:55,975
Because first of all, like, you know,

1662
01:07:56,035 --> 01:07:58,836
especially there are certain roles that are probably,

1663
01:07:58,856 --> 01:08:01,236
you don't have a full-time need for that person

1664
01:08:01,336 --> 01:08:02,117
on the team every day.

1665
01:08:02,877 --> 01:08:05,297
So I guess I shouldn't try to make it sound like

1666
01:08:05,317 --> 01:08:07,938
hyper-prescriptive, where like, teams never change.

1667
01:08:07,978 --> 01:08:09,179
And we're growing as a company,

1668
01:08:09,199 --> 01:08:10,379
so our teams have to change,

1669
01:08:10,399 --> 01:08:12,439
because quite literally, if we bring on more people,

1670
01:08:12,459 --> 01:08:16,341
you know, we can see the size of what makes a healthy team.

1671
01:08:16,381 --> 01:08:17,741
So, there are two things that I've seen

1672
01:08:17,881 --> 01:08:18,681
work reasonably well.

1673
01:08:18,701 --> 01:08:20,982
You know, we had motion graphics and UI,

1674
01:08:21,022 --> 01:08:21,482
and some of those...

1675
01:08:22,502 --> 01:08:25,723
creative roles that support specific parts of a project,

1676
01:08:26,123 --> 01:08:28,603
those tend to be more shared resource.

1677
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:31,184
But the way you approach that can vastly change

1678
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:32,124
how that dynamic works.

1679
01:08:32,284 --> 01:08:34,324
What I've seen work very poorly is that person

1680
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:36,105
is assigned to four jobs at once,

1681
01:08:36,485 --> 01:08:37,965
and they're just like ripping their hair out,

1682
01:08:38,065 --> 01:08:40,125
running across building to team to team,

1683
01:08:40,165 --> 01:08:41,185
trying to do everything at once.

1684
01:08:41,565 --> 01:08:43,286
So that would be a very poor structure for that.

1685
01:08:43,646 --> 01:08:45,186
What we would always like to do and prefer

1686
01:08:45,246 --> 01:08:46,606
is like you embed the person on the team,

1687
01:08:46,626 --> 01:08:48,667
and they may not be that long lived team member

1688
01:08:48,707 --> 01:08:50,267
based on the nature of the work they're doing.

1689
01:08:50,587 --> 01:08:51,627
But they can still show up

1690
01:08:52,267 --> 01:08:57,131
Be present. If you're in office, physically they should be co-located with the team if you've got that.

1691
01:08:57,731 --> 01:09:01,274
If they're not, whatever the team's rituals are, they should be a part of that for the time that they're there.

1692
01:09:01,654 --> 01:09:04,216
And of course, you know, you talk about, like, yeah, but we've got too many things to do.

1693
01:09:04,876 --> 01:09:08,159
But at some level, if you ask somebody to split their time across too many things at once,

1694
01:09:08,499 --> 01:09:10,821
you know, so it's like maybe somebody could split across two teams.

1695
01:09:10,881 --> 01:09:13,943
But even that, if they're going to every planning ritual and everything, that gets exhausting.

1696
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:17,465
So, 100%, your teams will change composition

1697
01:09:17,505 --> 01:09:18,686
and maybe the next initiative,

1698
01:09:19,067 --> 01:09:20,828
you just need a different makeup of people,

1699
01:09:21,168 --> 01:09:23,330
but you wanna be making small changes

1700
01:09:23,390 --> 01:09:24,831
to the composition to make it work.

1701
01:09:25,672 --> 01:09:27,373
And it also changes how you look for people.

1702
01:09:27,413 --> 01:09:29,134
We do really prioritize generalists

1703
01:09:29,174 --> 01:09:31,456
who aren't afraid to work across boundaries.

1704
01:09:31,756 --> 01:09:33,097
You know, they may not be the most efficient

1705
01:09:33,158 --> 01:09:34,198
if they're not a deep expert,

1706
01:09:34,559 --> 01:09:36,920
but if they're comfortable just solving problems,

1707
01:09:37,101 --> 01:09:39,162
it does let you keep your teams more intact.

1708
01:09:40,723 --> 01:09:41,144
Thanks, Chris.

1709
01:09:41,464 --> 01:09:41,584
Yeah.

1710
01:09:42,683 --> 01:09:43,543
Well, thank you so much again.

1711
01:09:43,563 --> 01:09:45,304
Appreciate everyone taking the time to be here.

1712
01:09:45,324 --> 01:09:52,667
Thank you.

1713
01:09:52,747 --> 01:09:53,888
Thank you.

1714
01:09:53,908 --> 01:09:54,268
Thank you.
