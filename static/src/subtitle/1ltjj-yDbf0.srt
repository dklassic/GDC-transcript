1
00:00:11,710 --> 00:00:12,611
I'm Anita Sarkeesian.

2
00:00:13,311 --> 00:00:15,153
I am the executive director of Feminist Frequency.

3
00:00:15,273 --> 00:00:18,516
One of the projects we run is the Games and Online Harassment Hotline, and that's what

4
00:00:18,556 --> 00:00:19,497
this talk is about.

5
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:26,042
So the Games and Online Harassment Hotline is an emotional support resource for people

6
00:00:26,082 --> 00:00:26,943
who make and play games.

7
00:00:27,023 --> 00:00:29,425
It's text message based here in the US.

8
00:00:30,205 --> 00:00:33,546
And yeah, this is Jay.

9
00:00:33,946 --> 00:00:35,606
Jay's going to do most of the talking today,

10
00:00:36,046 --> 00:00:38,067
which is for everybody's benefit.

11
00:00:39,147 --> 00:00:41,707
But I just want to tell you a little bit about how the project started.

12
00:00:42,768 --> 00:00:47,248
So in 2019, you might remember this,

13
00:00:47,488 --> 00:00:50,789
there was a large number of people who came forward

14
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:52,269
about abuses in the games industry.

15
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:54,990
It happened in late August, early September.

16
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,970
PAX was happening. It was a very intense moment.

17
00:00:58,451 --> 00:01:04,035
and lots of people came forward about toxicity abuse in gaming.

18
00:01:04,315 --> 00:01:08,399
And it was a very intense moment for a lot of us because...

19
00:01:08,419 --> 00:01:12,822
I mean, why? Of course it was an intense moment for all of us.

20
00:01:12,842 --> 00:01:14,724
Dude, it's Friday. We're good. I'm doing great.

21
00:01:15,164 --> 00:01:18,047
Right? Yes, thank you. I need this. Yeah, okay.

22
00:01:18,767 --> 00:01:22,130
So, what ended up happening in that moment was...

23
00:01:23,589 --> 00:01:27,491
Everybody was sort of flailing about trying to figure out how to support survivors, what

24
00:01:27,531 --> 00:01:31,072
to do about the harms that are coming forward, how do we talk about this, what does this

25
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:36,634
look like, and we're all kind of living in this trauma that is bubbling up.

26
00:01:37,594 --> 00:01:43,297
And I was thinking about how I have a lot of experience with abuse in the industry and

27
00:01:43,377 --> 00:01:47,518
how I understand this industry really well, so I just started talking to people.

28
00:01:47,958 --> 00:01:50,640
So for about a month, I reached out to everyone.

29
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:54,841
I could, I got introductions and was just asked questions like,

30
00:01:55,681 --> 00:01:59,003
what things would you like to see happen in this industry?

31
00:01:59,263 --> 00:02:02,044
What things have you seen tried that aren't working?

32
00:02:02,544 --> 00:02:05,225
What things are happening now that are working?

33
00:02:05,585 --> 00:02:10,347
And I took all of that information and decided to do several different projects

34
00:02:11,848 --> 00:02:16,669
under feminist frequency as a way to help reduce toxicity in the games industry.

35
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:20,811
And the Games Hotline was the first one that we started

36
00:02:20,931 --> 00:02:23,252
because what we realized in that moment

37
00:02:23,352 --> 00:02:26,233
was people are suffering right now

38
00:02:26,333 --> 00:02:27,413
and they have nowhere to go.

39
00:02:28,373 --> 00:02:30,834
So when all of that went down,

40
00:02:30,914 --> 00:02:33,015
we opened up our DMs on Twitter and was like,

41
00:02:33,035 --> 00:02:35,636
hey, if anyone needs anywhere to go, you can message us,

42
00:02:35,676 --> 00:02:38,577
which I was, why would you ever do that?

43
00:02:38,857 --> 00:02:41,178
It's insecure, you don't know who's on the other end of it

44
00:02:41,238 --> 00:02:42,918
and I was shocked at how many people reached out.

45
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:47,481
and like were very vulnerable and revealed really personal experiences.

46
00:02:48,242 --> 00:02:52,004
And that led me to realize that like people just need somewhere to go.

47
00:02:52,465 --> 00:02:55,447
Why don't we formalize this? Why don't we make it bigger than just

48
00:02:55,967 --> 00:02:59,770
me at the end of a Twitter account or like a friend of a friend of a friend?

49
00:03:01,011 --> 00:03:03,652
So the goal with the hotline has been to create a

50
00:03:06,754 --> 00:03:10,417
an emotional support resource that is games competent. That was always

51
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,197
the goal is that

52
00:03:12,402 --> 00:03:16,544
Internet life, online harassment, games culture is specific.

53
00:03:17,004 --> 00:03:19,265
And while the abuses and the harms and the toxicity

54
00:03:19,285 --> 00:03:21,926
that happen in our spaces are not unique to our industry,

55
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,888
the language around it, some of the ways that it manifests,

56
00:03:24,948 --> 00:03:28,309
the community, all of the things that make us gaming

57
00:03:30,390 --> 00:03:33,291
are really valuable to helping to serve us

58
00:03:33,471 --> 00:03:35,112
in the ways that we need it the most.

59
00:03:35,772 --> 00:03:37,953
So, yeah, I think that's it.

60
00:03:38,434 --> 00:03:39,175
Yeah, that's the story.

61
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:39,896
That's how it started.

62
00:03:39,936 --> 00:03:40,637
Now we run this thing.

63
00:03:40,978 --> 00:03:44,682
I'm going to pass it off to Jay, who is the Hotline Director and Programs Manager at Themis

64
00:03:44,703 --> 00:03:47,927
Frequency, and that's happening now.

65
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:48,287
All right.

66
00:03:49,649 --> 00:03:50,050
Thanks, Anita.

67
00:03:50,070 --> 00:03:50,150
Yeah.

68
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:50,650
Thank you.

69
00:03:53,244 --> 00:03:53,945
Hi, everyone.

70
00:03:54,025 --> 00:03:55,446
Thanks so much for being here.

71
00:03:56,106 --> 00:03:57,868
I'm Jay, I'm the Hotline Director

72
00:03:57,968 --> 00:03:59,789
at the Games and Online Harassment Hotline.

73
00:03:59,809 --> 00:04:01,891
I use they, them pronouns,

74
00:04:02,031 --> 00:04:04,373
and I was brought on in 2020 to help

75
00:04:04,894 --> 00:04:07,496
with the launch of this game's hotline.

76
00:04:07,896 --> 00:04:10,999
And like Anita said, right away,

77
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:12,920
what set us apart from other hotlines

78
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:15,162
was that our responders were all trained

79
00:04:15,182 --> 00:04:17,484
not only in mental health, emotional support,

80
00:04:17,844 --> 00:04:21,167
but also the culture issues in particular

81
00:04:21,307 --> 00:04:22,508
of being in games.

82
00:04:23,769 --> 00:04:27,030
And also being a resource that was created directly by,

83
00:04:28,411 --> 00:04:30,352
created by directly impacted folks

84
00:04:30,412 --> 00:04:33,313
who have had long histories and backgrounds in games

85
00:04:33,393 --> 00:04:36,354
and deep wisdom and knowledge of harassment and abuse

86
00:04:36,474 --> 00:04:38,035
made it really, yes?

87
00:04:38,055 --> 00:04:39,676
Nothing.

88
00:04:39,936 --> 00:04:40,036
Oh.

89
00:04:40,496 --> 00:04:41,777
So are both of these mics on?

90
00:04:42,417 --> 00:04:43,277
This is off, okay, sorry.

91
00:04:44,058 --> 00:04:44,298
Thank you.

92
00:04:47,692 --> 00:04:54,123
Yeah, created by directly impacted folks and drawing from like a deep wisdom of those experiences

93
00:04:54,203 --> 00:04:56,907
because this has been happening for such a long time.

94
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:06,302
And so we took 2020 to set everything up and launched in August of, yeah, in August.

95
00:05:06,502 --> 00:05:11,484
And since then, we've been supporting folks all across games on a wide swath of issues,

96
00:05:11,824 --> 00:05:17,365
from everything in-game harassment to industry workplace environments, online,

97
00:05:17,425 --> 00:05:21,186
general online harassment and threats, community conflicts and fallouts,

98
00:05:21,466 --> 00:05:22,506
and mental health struggles.

99
00:05:26,302 --> 00:05:30,085
We just published an impact report about that first year

100
00:05:30,446 --> 00:05:32,607
of conversations that we had.

101
00:05:32,627 --> 00:05:36,671
It has a bunch of anonymized data about who called in,

102
00:05:36,751 --> 00:05:38,012
what folks are texting about,

103
00:05:38,112 --> 00:05:39,453
what types of trends we're seeing.

104
00:05:39,873 --> 00:05:41,014
Some highlights are here.

105
00:05:41,034 --> 00:05:46,118
A really pretty even half and half of our texters

106
00:05:46,519 --> 00:05:49,341
were players and folks who work in the industry.

107
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:52,283
The most common topics we saw

108
00:05:52,403 --> 00:05:54,325
were online harassment and mental health.

109
00:05:54,925 --> 00:05:57,727
and among texters who experience identity-based harassment,

110
00:05:57,827 --> 00:06:00,568
the most common form was gender-based harassment

111
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:03,290
followed by sexuality and race.

112
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,591
So if you want to look at any more of that data,

113
00:06:06,651 --> 00:06:09,473
you can find that on our website on gameshotline.org.

114
00:06:09,493 --> 00:06:11,554
I'm not going to go through much more of it here.

115
00:06:11,654 --> 00:06:14,035
I want to just kind of pull out and look

116
00:06:14,055 --> 00:06:18,458
a little closer on some things relevant to the games industry.

117
00:06:22,729 --> 00:06:30,351
I guess where I want to start is that really overwhelmingly burnout and hostile workplaces

118
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:34,292
were the most common things we talk about on the hotline with folks in the games industry.

119
00:06:34,312 --> 00:06:37,313
And when I say those two things, I don't mean them distinctly.

120
00:06:37,393 --> 00:06:40,714
Like there are these people who are burnt out and these people who are facing hostile

121
00:06:40,754 --> 00:06:41,314
workplaces.

122
00:06:41,714 --> 00:06:43,974
They are very much compounded in this.

123
00:06:45,715 --> 00:06:48,017
just the way that paints such a picture.

124
00:06:48,037 --> 00:06:53,220
And so I think it really is important to, like, address these issues

125
00:06:53,441 --> 00:06:56,943
in conjunction because they can't be pulled apart in people's experiences.

126
00:06:57,684 --> 00:07:01,267
We know, of course, that so many people come into games because they love it.

127
00:07:01,807 --> 00:07:06,290
We hear all the time that making games, working in games has been their dream.

128
00:07:06,370 --> 00:07:07,791
It's been something they've always wanted.

129
00:07:08,372 --> 00:07:11,154
But because of the unsustainable workplace conditions,

130
00:07:11,734 --> 00:07:13,176
now they feel like they can't stay.

131
00:07:13,416 --> 00:07:14,116
Now they feel like.

132
00:07:14,637 --> 00:07:15,897
they're being run into the ground.

133
00:07:16,657 --> 00:07:22,199
And so we see, of course, the stress and deadlines

134
00:07:22,340 --> 00:07:27,361
and overworking compounded with abusive dynamics from bosses,

135
00:07:28,102 --> 00:07:31,323
compounded with the normalcy of offensive

136
00:07:31,503 --> 00:07:32,663
and oppressive statements,

137
00:07:33,384 --> 00:07:36,005
compounded with the microaggressions

138
00:07:36,165 --> 00:07:39,466
or the day-to-day actions that reinforce the gatekeeping

139
00:07:39,646 --> 00:07:42,447
and marginalization of underrepresented developers.

140
00:07:43,399 --> 00:07:46,743
compounded with sexual violence at work,

141
00:07:47,163 --> 00:07:48,765
outside of work, with coworkers,

142
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:50,267
or at professional events.

143
00:07:51,993 --> 00:07:56,394
and then compounded with HR departments that diminish or dehumanize folks,

144
00:07:56,815 --> 00:07:58,916
even yelling and further traumatizing folks.

145
00:07:59,796 --> 00:08:01,957
And so these, of course, is not...

146
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:06,599
So the information and stories I'm telling y'all today are general trends

147
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:08,380
and not about any one individual.

148
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,621
Our hotline is obviously confidential.

149
00:08:11,561 --> 00:08:16,363
But these, like, overwhelmingly, the conversations that we have really

150
00:08:17,624 --> 00:08:20,545
paint a picture together, and that's what I'm sharing with you today.

151
00:08:21,286 --> 00:08:23,370
And so all of those things compounded together,

152
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:27,379
it creates such an interesting experience

153
00:08:27,399 --> 00:08:28,541
because...

154
00:08:32,920 --> 00:08:34,700
their work, because for game developers,

155
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:36,341
their work is so rooted in passion.

156
00:08:36,881 --> 00:08:40,983
They also feel guilty for the suffering

157
00:08:41,003 --> 00:08:42,584
that they're dealing with, right?

158
00:08:42,624 --> 00:08:44,845
There are so many messages that tell workers

159
00:08:44,885 --> 00:08:46,665
that they should be grateful to work here,

160
00:08:46,685 --> 00:08:48,506
that they're replaceable and disposable

161
00:08:48,546 --> 00:08:50,707
because there's hundreds of people who would want their job.

162
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:53,488
And it creates this spiral where folks feel,

163
00:08:53,508 --> 00:08:57,190
this is my dream job, but I'm suffering,

164
00:08:57,870 --> 00:08:58,831
but I should be grateful.

165
00:08:59,852 --> 00:09:01,654
but I don't know if I can keep going.

166
00:09:01,954 --> 00:09:04,918
And it really just kind of wears away

167
00:09:05,058 --> 00:09:06,139
at folks' mental health.

168
00:09:06,539 --> 00:09:09,723
And so that's a lot of what we support people around

169
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,486
and talk to people with on the Games Hotline.

170
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:18,330
The other thing I wanted to point out here, you notice in the last slide with the pie chart,

171
00:09:18,751 --> 00:09:24,094
we have been hearing from more and more students who are studying game development

172
00:09:24,334 --> 00:09:27,336
or games industry related degrees.

173
00:09:27,976 --> 00:09:33,599
And it has been really interesting to see how closely the things that they bring

174
00:09:33,639 --> 00:09:34,980
to the hotline, what they're struggling.

175
00:09:36,115 --> 00:09:40,199
really mirrors the stories we hear from game developers working in the industry.

176
00:09:40,319 --> 00:09:45,063
We hear the same burnout, the same stress, the same, you know, this used to be my job,

177
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:50,829
but I don't know if I can do this anymore. And also the same hostile environments,

178
00:09:50,949 --> 00:09:58,255
sexual violence, maybe not from bosses, but instead from professors or other mentors in the space.

179
00:09:59,136 --> 00:10:03,277
And so, yeah, I thought that was really that's been really eye opening to see, too,

180
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:08,379
that this is starting even before some folks make it into the industry.

181
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:15,541
Like this, yeah.

182
00:10:17,353 --> 00:10:23,396
So like Anita said, right, this hotline obviously came from a very survivor-centered space,

183
00:10:24,076 --> 00:10:26,717
largely inspired by a lot of the Me Too stuff.

184
00:10:27,778 --> 00:10:34,601
And we, yeah, so we started from that kind of survivor-centered space and then of course

185
00:10:35,161 --> 00:10:39,443
knew so much about the hostile workplaces and crunch and those problems in the industry

186
00:10:39,483 --> 00:10:42,105
knowing that they would need mental health support there.

187
00:10:42,652 --> 00:10:44,913
And then of course we know in gaming communities too,

188
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,375
there's a lot of in-game harassment

189
00:10:46,415 --> 00:10:47,736
and harassment in gaming communities.

190
00:10:48,176 --> 00:10:49,677
And so we prepared for all of that.

191
00:10:49,697 --> 00:10:53,060
The one thing we didn't necessarily anticipate

192
00:10:53,140 --> 00:10:54,721
and the surprise I kind of wanted to share with y'all

193
00:10:54,761 --> 00:10:56,022
that we learned in our first year,

194
00:10:57,283 --> 00:11:01,227
was that we didn't expect folks who have caused harassment

195
00:11:01,687 --> 00:11:05,950
or harm in the industry to text us for support.

196
00:11:06,691 --> 00:11:13,955
But it actually really the first week that we opened started happening just kind of on its own.

197
00:11:15,335 --> 00:11:19,918
And that was a moment for us. We had to really look at, you know, what is

198
00:11:20,738 --> 00:11:23,559
the space that we're creating? What are we doing this work for?

199
00:11:25,580 --> 00:11:29,103
A lot of other hotline models, a lot of rape crisis hotlines, for example,

200
00:11:29,824 --> 00:11:36,089
will not offer services to folks who have been accused of or have like

201
00:11:36,649 --> 00:11:39,391
protective orders against them for sexual violence.

202
00:11:40,832 --> 00:11:43,776
And so, yeah, we really had to ask ourselves, like, what do we want to do?

203
00:11:43,796 --> 00:11:45,097
Do we want to hang up on these people?

204
00:11:45,117 --> 00:11:49,542
Do we want to talk to them, even though they're kind of causing the harassment

205
00:11:49,563 --> 00:11:51,064
and we're an anti-harassment resource?

206
00:11:51,605 --> 00:11:54,969
And ultimately, we decided that we did want to talk to them

207
00:11:55,129 --> 00:11:59,194
and we did want to find a way to hold accountable conversations with them.

208
00:11:59,905 --> 00:12:02,046
We made that decision because we really understand

209
00:12:02,086 --> 00:12:04,067
that this issue of harassment and abuse

210
00:12:04,307 --> 00:12:06,028
is cultural and systemic,

211
00:12:06,889 --> 00:12:09,310
not necessarily because of individual bad apples.

212
00:12:10,010 --> 00:12:12,171
And ultimately, for people to change,

213
00:12:12,251 --> 00:12:13,672
they have to feel supported.

214
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:17,914
It's really hard to want to make hard changes in yourself

215
00:12:18,054 --> 00:12:20,355
when you feel like there's no hope and no one would care.

216
00:12:21,128 --> 00:12:22,971
But at the same time, it's not always appropriate

217
00:12:22,991 --> 00:12:24,534
for the victim, survivor,

218
00:12:24,654 --> 00:12:26,897
or directly impacted community to offer support.

219
00:12:27,498 --> 00:12:29,882
And we also know that our current institutions

220
00:12:29,942 --> 00:12:32,467
are often more complicit than accountable

221
00:12:32,747 --> 00:12:34,109
and offer very little support

222
00:12:34,149 --> 00:12:35,472
for people who have caused harm as well.

223
00:12:36,423 --> 00:12:40,605
And so as the hotline, we occupy this unique third party space that can say,

224
00:12:41,165 --> 00:12:42,846
hey, we're here for you.

225
00:12:43,206 --> 00:12:46,888
It sounds like you hurt some people and did some things that were not OK,

226
00:12:47,488 --> 00:12:49,509
but it also sounds like you want to do things differently.

227
00:12:49,990 --> 00:12:50,870
And that matters, too.

228
00:12:51,370 --> 00:12:53,491
Let's talk about what you need to make that change.

229
00:12:55,192 --> 00:12:59,294
So, yeah, so we started so we started so we started talking to people,

230
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:00,575
we started talking about that.

231
00:13:00,735 --> 00:13:03,656
We were open to talking to people and more people came and talked to us.

232
00:13:04,485 --> 00:13:07,687
And I wanted to kind of dive a little deeper

233
00:13:07,847 --> 00:13:11,109
and share some of the things that we found.

234
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:13,551
The first thing I wanna touch on

235
00:13:13,751 --> 00:13:15,692
is that folks are coming to us

236
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:18,334
from a wide spectrum of self-awareness.

237
00:13:19,355 --> 00:13:22,837
On one end, from all the accusations are lies,

238
00:13:23,958 --> 00:13:25,118
all these women are crazy,

239
00:13:25,719 --> 00:13:27,420
to something in the middle like,

240
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,861
okay, maybe I shouldn't have said these things,

241
00:13:29,961 --> 00:13:31,703
but it's not like I'm a sexual predator.

242
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:37,201
to the other end of, you know, I really see these patterns

243
00:13:37,261 --> 00:13:39,502
and how I keep harming people and I want to change,

244
00:13:39,542 --> 00:13:42,063
but I don't know how, or even if it's possible.

245
00:13:43,103 --> 00:13:45,044
And so that was also another thing we had to learn

246
00:13:45,064 --> 00:13:48,205
of like how to really meet people where they were,

247
00:13:48,225 --> 00:13:50,346
because all those conversations look really different,

248
00:13:50,906 --> 00:13:53,086
but are all really important steps on the journey.

249
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:58,921
The other thing we really saw that just became so apparent

250
00:13:59,062 --> 00:14:00,682
as we were having these conversations

251
00:14:01,222 --> 00:14:05,343
were that isolation and exile were the biggest struggles

252
00:14:05,423 --> 00:14:07,324
for these folks who are wanting to change

253
00:14:07,444 --> 00:14:10,905
and learn from the harm that they caused.

254
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,846
Of course, this is an understandable

255
00:14:14,886 --> 00:14:17,506
and sometimes warranted consequence of causing harm.

256
00:14:18,533 --> 00:14:21,755
But what we're seeing is that what happens is that

257
00:14:22,496 --> 00:14:24,477
these folks end up feeling really alone,

258
00:14:24,537 --> 00:14:26,898
really unsupported and often confused.

259
00:14:27,439 --> 00:14:30,961
A lot of them often express a lot of confusion

260
00:14:31,041 --> 00:14:34,002
and lack of clarity around even what they did

261
00:14:34,022 --> 00:14:37,825
that was harmful and why or even necessarily

262
00:14:37,985 --> 00:14:40,486
who exactly was impacted.

263
00:14:40,506 --> 00:14:43,808
And so that becomes also a barrier

264
00:14:43,968 --> 00:14:46,109
in their own kind of learning and growing.

265
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:50,110
And so of course, I'm not here to say that no one should,

266
00:14:50,631 --> 00:14:53,171
that folks should never be removed from communities

267
00:14:53,311 --> 00:14:55,292
or positions, especially if they're continuing

268
00:14:55,692 --> 00:14:58,972
to actively cause harm, maybe abusing a position of power

269
00:14:59,453 --> 00:15:00,673
to continue that harm.

270
00:15:01,913 --> 00:15:03,754
But the thing that we are seeing on the hotline

271
00:15:04,194 --> 00:15:05,914
is that simply removing someone

272
00:15:07,214 --> 00:15:09,915
doesn't solve the larger problem, and it doesn't

273
00:15:11,475 --> 00:15:19,422
it doesn't necessarily automatically help someone change or grow. So yeah, so we're still kind of

274
00:15:19,502 --> 00:15:27,008
exploring what an alternative solution, an alternative path forward can look like there.

275
00:15:28,269 --> 00:15:31,452
These have been really challenging conversations and we're still learning

276
00:15:31,592 --> 00:15:33,353
and wanting to improve the way that we do this.

277
00:15:34,559 --> 00:15:41,484
Yeah, we're just really experimenting and trying things out and continuing to build on the ways that we have these

278
00:15:42,024 --> 00:15:44,767
empathetic and validating but not endorsing

279
00:15:46,788 --> 00:16:00,739
or saying that what they did was okay or minimizing the harm that they caused. We wrote a piece on our website for more with more details about how we have those accountable conversations if you're interested in reading more about that.

280
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:22,913
Awesome. So yeah, really quickly, going into year two, we are still a baby fledgling hotline, but we're really excited that actually now that we're halfway through our second year, we're actually on track to double our conversation volume, which means more folks are hearing about us and reaching out.

281
00:16:23,974 --> 00:16:28,237
We're also working on trying to share more of our knowledge and make more of it public.

282
00:16:28,978 --> 00:16:36,042
We have so many conversations as the team behind the hotline of like, wow, we saw a

283
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:40,805
whole bunch of blackmail-related chats come in, so why don't we reach out to lawyers and

284
00:16:40,845 --> 00:16:44,728
security experts and therapists and see how we can help.

285
00:16:46,229 --> 00:16:48,550
really refine the way that we respond to this.

286
00:16:49,250 --> 00:16:51,952
And so we have a bunch of cool conversations like that,

287
00:16:52,192 --> 00:16:55,033
and I'm wondering how we can take an extra step

288
00:16:55,313 --> 00:16:58,535
to share that with folks who don't text the hotline,

289
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,556
because currently the only way you would get that

290
00:17:00,616 --> 00:17:01,877
is if you texted into us,

291
00:17:02,017 --> 00:17:03,298
but we know that there are a lot of people

292
00:17:03,318 --> 00:17:04,218
who can't or won't.

293
00:17:05,715 --> 00:17:10,956
And then, of course, our goal always will be just staying responsive to the community.

294
00:17:11,456 --> 00:17:20,419
We don't want to prioritize growth or expansion in a way that doesn't reflect what is coming

295
00:17:20,479 --> 00:17:23,880
up for folks and what folks are bringing to us and wanting and needing for us.

296
00:17:24,980 --> 00:17:25,660
So, yeah.

297
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:26,500
I.

298
00:17:31,615 --> 00:17:39,081
I linked a few other resources here around having supportive conversations with other

299
00:17:39,141 --> 00:17:43,725
folks and also just around reducing toxicity in the workplace.

300
00:17:44,786 --> 00:17:50,870
I didn't want to repeat all of that here and instead wanted to see if there were folks

301
00:17:50,910 --> 00:17:52,131
who wanted to ask questions.

302
00:17:54,668 --> 00:17:56,310
Yeah, see if we could respond to some stuff.

303
00:17:56,350 --> 00:17:58,071
So I'm curious in this room,

304
00:17:58,111 --> 00:17:59,612
what specific questions you have

305
00:17:59,632 --> 00:18:01,214
around how to support each other,

306
00:18:01,234 --> 00:18:03,536
how workplaces can support employees,

307
00:18:03,656 --> 00:18:05,957
and what it takes to break cycles of harassment.

308
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:08,640
Or anything else specific about the hotline

309
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,281
or things that are on your mind.

310
00:18:10,301 --> 00:18:12,883
Yeah, sure, go ahead.

311
00:18:15,065 --> 00:18:16,226
Hi there, thank you so much,

312
00:18:16,486 --> 00:18:18,988
both for this presentation and the service itself.

313
00:18:20,209 --> 00:18:22,310
I was wondering if you could speak on

314
00:18:24,721 --> 00:18:29,765
I am like a community manager for several online spaces and often I see that there is

315
00:18:29,805 --> 00:18:35,190
an immense amount of pressure put on the people in charge of said spaces when someone is being

316
00:18:35,271 --> 00:18:38,033
harmful to completely remove the person.

317
00:18:39,374 --> 00:18:44,840
Would you have any advice for how to negotiate kind of conversations around that within the

318
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,801
greater community?

319
00:18:47,762 --> 00:18:52,904
and building that kind of trust that, no, we do hear you and care about what you're talking about.

320
00:18:53,424 --> 00:18:57,325
We're just not completely cutting off X person or we are.

321
00:18:59,046 --> 00:19:04,988
Yeah, I mean, there's never going to be one size fits all, right? It will really depend on like

322
00:19:05,348 --> 00:19:11,770
how your community feels and what it's the structure of it looks like. I think really

323
00:19:12,350 --> 00:19:16,491
the problem we run into is that a lot of the like policies and stuff that we write for

324
00:19:17,372 --> 00:19:23,957
our spaces tend to be very punishment-oriented because we want to believe that punishment

325
00:19:24,077 --> 00:19:29,641
will solve or deter a problem when we've seen that it doesn't necessarily do that.

326
00:19:30,922 --> 00:19:35,986
And also that it is very kind of binary, of you're either a good person and a good

327
00:19:36,046 --> 00:19:39,128
member of this community or you're a bad person and a bad member of this community.

328
00:19:39,479 --> 00:19:43,242
when in reality there are many ways to hurt each other

329
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:47,484
and make mistakes and run into misunderstandings or conflict.

330
00:19:47,985 --> 00:19:50,867
It's pretty natural as a part of just being in a community,

331
00:19:50,907 --> 00:19:52,327
right, which I'm sure you know.

332
00:19:52,347 --> 00:19:53,268
Yes.

333
00:19:54,169 --> 00:19:58,812
And so I think, yeah, maybe reimagining with your community

334
00:19:58,872 --> 00:19:59,892
or with your mod team.

335
00:20:00,905 --> 00:20:04,628
what it looks like to really start these conversations a little earlier.

336
00:20:04,969 --> 00:20:07,050
Not wait until they break the big rule,

337
00:20:07,751 --> 00:20:13,636
but see if there are ways you can catch smaller signs or flags

338
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:17,340
and what the protocols for having that reaching out.

339
00:20:17,940 --> 00:20:20,622
having that conversation looks like.

340
00:20:21,062 --> 00:20:24,704
And so then there's so much more wiggle room

341
00:20:24,764 --> 00:20:26,165
for both you and your mod team,

342
00:20:26,526 --> 00:20:30,508
the person maybe causing conflict in a space or harm

343
00:20:31,589 --> 00:20:34,751
before it reaches an escalation point where it is like,

344
00:20:34,791 --> 00:20:37,712
hey, we have to remove you from this space.

345
00:20:38,573 --> 00:20:39,573
Great, thank you so much.

346
00:20:39,593 --> 00:20:42,996
Hi, thank you for the talk.

347
00:20:43,016 --> 00:20:44,757
So I have two questions.

348
00:20:45,517 --> 00:20:46,197
You were talking about,

349
00:20:47,897 --> 00:20:50,579
that the expansion is not really your focus,

350
00:20:50,659 --> 00:20:53,181
but I was wondering if you have thought about expanding

351
00:20:53,201 --> 00:20:56,204
to other countries, or maybe opening up to a chat

352
00:20:56,224 --> 00:20:56,965
or something like that?

353
00:20:57,565 --> 00:20:58,466
That's the first question.

354
00:20:59,187 --> 00:21:01,669
And the second question is maybe a bit more complex

355
00:21:01,749 --> 00:21:04,151
and maybe not super relevant, but I was,

356
00:21:04,651 --> 00:21:06,333
as an employee that's working at a company

357
00:21:06,353 --> 00:21:07,274
that's very small, but.

358
00:21:07,694 --> 00:21:16,820
continuously growing. I was wondering if you have any suggestions or plans on how to proactively

359
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:21,043
work against having employees have to reach out to this sort of hotline, if that makes

360
00:21:21,063 --> 00:21:21,283
sense.

361
00:21:23,804 --> 00:21:27,987
Yeah, I'll let you talk about that. So for the first question.

362
00:21:29,372 --> 00:21:37,676
We, yeah, we're currently US only and we are open or we're online from 3 to 7 p.m. Pacific time every day.

363
00:21:37,696 --> 00:21:45,240
We would love to be a 24-7 hotline in many different countries, but of course we're little.

364
00:21:47,000 --> 00:21:52,322
So yeah, we definitely, we're definitely keeping track of information of when folks are wanting to text us

365
00:21:52,722 --> 00:21:56,023
to know which direction to expand. We would love to be open for more hours.

366
00:21:56,363 --> 00:22:00,964
We've also thought about expanding to other countries for sure, but we would definitely

367
00:22:00,984 --> 00:22:05,406
want to do that in a very cognizant way. Understanding that like...

368
00:22:05,426 --> 00:22:06,166
I can imagine the culture.

369
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:10,827
The culture, right. So we would want to make sure that that was taken into consideration and not

370
00:22:11,287 --> 00:22:12,308
just do that thoughtlessly.

371
00:22:13,748 --> 00:22:18,590
And yeah, we are also looking into like integrating web chat and stuff like that.

372
00:22:19,150 --> 00:22:21,311
So, yeah, on the horizon.

373
00:22:21,511 --> 00:22:23,612
I'll also say, can I? Sorry. Yes, this is on.

374
00:22:23,952 --> 00:22:27,094
I'll also say that, like, the reason we have to pick and choose

375
00:22:27,174 --> 00:22:29,315
how we expand and what that looks like is financial.

376
00:22:29,795 --> 00:22:32,816
So like if game studios wanted to help us and support us

377
00:22:32,876 --> 00:22:35,978
by giving us money to expand, we could do that kind of work. Right.

378
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:39,439
Or if we wanted to go into different regions, getting cultural partners

379
00:22:39,479 --> 00:22:42,400
and people who are on board to help us do that work, because

380
00:22:43,936 --> 00:22:45,157
When we first started, I was like,

381
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,157
I'm gonna start a hotline.

382
00:22:46,237 --> 00:22:48,198
I had no fucking idea how expensive hotlines were.

383
00:22:48,238 --> 00:22:50,679
So, you know, to be honest, we're doing it.

384
00:22:50,739 --> 00:22:52,720
It's great, but that's part of it, right?

385
00:22:53,680 --> 00:22:55,060
The other thing I wanted to say is that

386
00:22:55,541 --> 00:22:57,741
we work with Take This, who some of them are down here,

387
00:22:58,202 --> 00:22:59,562
to run the Cultureship Project,

388
00:22:59,602 --> 00:23:01,123
which I feel like is very in tandem

389
00:23:01,143 --> 00:23:01,963
with what we're doing here,

390
00:23:02,043 --> 00:23:05,224
which is about going into studios and addressing harm.

391
00:23:07,166 --> 00:23:10,070
from a systemic level and doing education around that.

392
00:23:10,150 --> 00:23:12,893
So that is a huge piece of what we're doing as well

393
00:23:13,454 --> 00:23:14,676
as a part of Feminist Frequency.

394
00:23:15,076 --> 00:23:16,218
So I'm happy to talk to you more about that

395
00:23:16,238 --> 00:23:17,279
or anyone after.

396
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:17,860
Thank you.

397
00:23:19,985 --> 00:23:22,445
Hello. Thank you so much for everything that you do.

398
00:23:23,605 --> 00:23:27,886
I was curious to hear more about support available,

399
00:23:28,026 --> 00:23:30,167
honestly, for the people who are running the hotline.

400
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:33,067
I could imagine that there's a lot of emotional labor

401
00:23:33,267 --> 00:23:36,448
and training involved in, like,

402
00:23:37,168 --> 00:23:38,428
being able to respond to these things,

403
00:23:38,468 --> 00:23:40,548
particularly when you opened up the floor

404
00:23:40,628 --> 00:23:42,449
to people who have caused harm.

405
00:23:42,549 --> 00:23:44,649
I can imagine that would be a very difficult conversation

406
00:23:44,669 --> 00:23:46,510
to have, you know, over and over again.

407
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:51,152
So I'd love to hear about how y'all have supported the people running the hotline.

408
00:23:52,232 --> 00:23:57,875
And I would love to look at that also through the lens of how people at game studios who might

409
00:23:57,895 --> 00:24:02,537
be in a similar situation, often I feel especially at smaller companies, there's a lot of pressure on

410
00:24:02,577 --> 00:24:07,920
maybe one individual to be like the interpersonal person. And that can put a lot of pressure on them

411
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:12,182
and a lot of, you know, requires a lot of emotional labor. So I'd just love to hear

412
00:24:12,842 --> 00:24:15,744
any recommendations for supporting those individuals so that they can better help.

413
00:24:16,785 --> 00:24:17,867
the people that they are serving?

414
00:24:19,449 --> 00:24:22,674
Yeah, the first part's a little easier to answer.

415
00:24:22,714 --> 00:24:25,338
The second part, definitely, I'm holding that in my heart.

416
00:24:27,342 --> 00:24:29,044
The only thing that makes this possible

417
00:24:29,185 --> 00:24:30,406
is that we're not doing it alone.

418
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:36,665
You can't run a hotline with just one person sitting there answering everything by themselves.

419
00:24:37,745 --> 00:24:41,688
We have a phenomenal team of agents and supervisors.

420
00:24:42,168 --> 00:24:49,954
And so we have supervisors on at every shift, and we have clinicians available every shift as well.

421
00:24:50,394 --> 00:24:56,398
And so agents are not only not responding alone, but have that support.

422
00:24:57,379 --> 00:25:01,902
both for, you know, if they have a question on like how they might want to direct a conversation

423
00:25:01,942 --> 00:25:06,645
or respond to a conversation or different resources to pull, but also for themselves.

424
00:25:07,066 --> 00:25:13,270
Because yeah, a lot of these conversations can be reactive. It can bring up a lot of feelings to

425
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,975
talk about, talk to someone who has caused harm or even talk to a survivor who has experienced something.

426
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:24,781
really potentially triggering to you or really just awful to hear about.

427
00:25:24,801 --> 00:25:30,584
And so, yeah, our supervisors and just the peer group is there.

428
00:25:30,644 --> 00:25:34,245
We have like group debriefs and support sessions

429
00:25:34,526 --> 00:25:36,767
and games chats and all of that.

430
00:25:36,887 --> 00:25:37,507
It really is a.

431
00:25:38,767 --> 00:25:39,707
It's a community effort.

432
00:25:39,828 --> 00:25:41,268
It's never an individual effort.

433
00:25:41,368 --> 00:25:43,968
And I think that partially speaks to your second question

434
00:25:44,048 --> 00:25:44,389
as well.

435
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,909
It isn't possible for a single individual

436
00:25:46,949 --> 00:25:49,990
to hold all of that for someone.

437
00:25:50,430 --> 00:25:53,051
When we talk a lot about self-care

438
00:25:53,671 --> 00:25:59,132
and that emotional labor piece, and that conversation

439
00:25:59,272 --> 00:26:01,653
absolutely needs to shift towards community care

440
00:26:02,093 --> 00:26:04,773
and knowing that it is never about,

441
00:26:05,493 --> 00:26:08,274
that it is always going to be about interdependence.

442
00:26:10,094 --> 00:26:11,255
Does that answer your question?

443
00:26:11,275 --> 00:26:12,075
Yeah, it absolutely does.

444
00:26:12,095 --> 00:26:12,615
Thank you so much.

445
00:26:12,655 --> 00:26:15,316
Yeah.

446
00:26:15,676 --> 00:26:18,256
Thank you for being here and sharing this information with us.

447
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:23,237
It's a I very much value it just because it reminds me a lot of

448
00:26:23,978 --> 00:26:26,098
like about conversations about like restorative justice.

449
00:26:26,138 --> 00:26:27,598
And that's something very important to me.

450
00:26:29,019 --> 00:26:29,599
My name is Carlos.

451
00:26:29,639 --> 00:26:31,019
I'm the program manager for Game Heads.

452
00:26:31,459 --> 00:26:33,780
And part of my job is to really

453
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:36,981
look out for a lot of the youth that are in the program.

454
00:26:37,141 --> 00:26:37,981
Just make sure that they're OK.

455
00:26:40,152 --> 00:26:46,720
And something that I've been thinking about a lot lately is just because I'm very new

456
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,804
to the games industry, but not so new in education.

457
00:26:52,299 --> 00:26:53,600
Something I've been thinking about is like,

458
00:26:53,660 --> 00:26:55,643
how could we as an industry start implementing

459
00:26:55,663 --> 00:26:57,305
more systems of restorative justice?

460
00:26:58,286 --> 00:27:01,049
And in the context of like young people,

461
00:27:01,810 --> 00:27:04,974
in allowing young folks to actually make mistakes

462
00:27:04,994 --> 00:27:08,719
in their growth, but also hold them accountable as well.

463
00:27:10,861 --> 00:27:11,962
I love talking about this.

464
00:27:15,147 --> 00:27:17,849
all these people know, this is all I want to talk about all day.

465
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,652
I want to be cognizant of the time, unfortunately,

466
00:27:21,672 --> 00:27:25,294
because otherwise I could stay here.

467
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:28,917
How do I want to, how is the smallest way I could answer this?

468
00:27:31,018 --> 00:27:32,799
It's a big question. It is, it is.

469
00:27:32,820 --> 00:27:36,282
Yeah, I mean, I think like...

470
00:27:39,042 --> 00:27:42,884
Again, yes, big question, big, big solutions out there.

471
00:27:43,464 --> 00:27:47,065
But I think I want to start with just what we do here on the hotline.

472
00:27:47,085 --> 00:27:52,007
I think I think a great place to start is always going to be making space

473
00:27:52,027 --> 00:27:55,369
for vulnerability and for people's humanity and dignity.

474
00:27:55,389 --> 00:27:57,669
I think just as a baseline.

475
00:27:58,597 --> 00:27:59,937
that makes a huge difference.

476
00:28:00,598 --> 00:28:05,279
And so, yeah, having conversations

477
00:28:05,339 --> 00:28:08,339
that are not shame-based, that are not punishment-based,

478
00:28:09,480 --> 00:28:14,241
and offering that room an invitation to accountability

479
00:28:14,261 --> 00:28:17,821
to say, hey, we care about you, you're important to us,

480
00:28:18,542 --> 00:28:19,802
and also this has happened,

481
00:28:20,482 --> 00:28:22,202
and we needed to do something to make it right.

482
00:28:22,222 --> 00:28:24,463
Awesome, thank you.

483
00:28:25,942 --> 00:28:27,664
Thank you all so much for being here.
