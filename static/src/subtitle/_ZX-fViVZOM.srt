00:00:11,830 --> 00:00:14,392
Please welcome Dom Tate.

2
00:00:14,392 --> 00:00:21,759
Hi everybody, my name is Dom Tate, as has been said, and I am research director of the games

3
00:00:21,759 --> 00:00:26,663
team at Omdia, an analyst firm that uses its research and data to help companies make informed

4
00:00:26,663 --> 00:00:27,684
business decisions.

5
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:33,203
In the past six months, most of those companies have been asking about the metaverse.

6
00:00:33,203 --> 00:00:36,826
What it is, what will it become, and where do games fit in within this puzzle?

7
00:00:36,826 --> 00:00:40,628
So I'm going to use this talk to try to address those questions.

8
00:00:40,628 --> 00:00:42,989
So a good place to start would be what the metaverse is.

9
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:51,555
And this is the most I can boil down a definition to. A virtual shared space where users can do everything they'd expect in the real world.

10
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:56,949
Now, there's no consensus view of how best to describe the metaverse in detail.

11
00:00:56,949 --> 00:01:01,312
And as a side point, I often hear it quite scornfully described as very poorly

12
00:01:01,312 --> 00:01:04,015
defined, but I would argue that's entirely unsurprising.

13
00:01:04,015 --> 00:01:08,798
This will ultimately be a virtual world that will mirror and in many ways augment

14
00:01:08,798 --> 00:01:12,601
the real world. And I've certainly never seen a 200 word definition of the real

15
00:01:12,601 --> 00:01:15,143
world that feels remotely satisfying.

16
00:01:15,143 --> 00:01:19,387
But with that said, here are what I think are six useful points that should help to

17
00:01:19,387 --> 00:01:21,468
frame the end goal of the metaverse.

18
00:01:22,182 --> 00:01:31,732
No limits. The metaphors should be able to be accessed by any number of people at any time on any internet connected device or platform they wish.

19
00:01:31,732 --> 00:01:38,799
Harmony. Every user is offered the same virtual world to inhabit with changes implemented in real time.

20
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:45,066
Equality. Content within the metaphors could be created just as easily by an individual user as a major company.

21
00:01:45,942 --> 00:01:50,786
Identity. Users can create an avatar but represent them wherever they travel in the

22
00:01:50,786 --> 00:01:57,151
metaverse. A persistent virtual social presence. Economy. A sophisticated system of trade like the

23
00:01:57,151 --> 00:02:02,836
real world economy, again with no limits in terms of the platforms where those digital assets have

24
00:02:02,836 --> 00:02:09,321
meaning. And finally, immersivity. Ultimately a world rich and realistic enough to feel fully

25
00:02:09,321 --> 00:02:14,766
connected with, an absence of any jarring realisation that the user is within a simulation.

26
00:02:15,892 --> 00:02:18,936
And here's a way to conceptualize the metaphors that I find helpful.

27
00:02:18,936 --> 00:02:22,660
And I can give it a video gaming analogy too.

28
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:29,307
In Super Mario 64, the setting of Peach's Castle used paintings within it to warp you into different worlds.

29
00:02:29,307 --> 00:02:34,633
Now, what if the base metaphors, if you like, is represented by Peach's Castle or this gallery?

30
00:02:34,633 --> 00:02:36,996
Your identity or avatar is here.

31
00:02:37,637 --> 00:02:43,481
And then you've got the Minecraft painting and the Fortnite painting and the ones for Meta's virtual business meetings and so on.

32
00:02:43,481 --> 00:02:53,027
Now, there is a necessary separateness required here because it would be a really bad idea for the Resident Evil world to overlap with the Hello Kitty world.

33
00:02:53,027 --> 00:02:56,590
But nevertheless, these worlds should speak to each other in some way.

34
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,612
They should have a harmonised base area for access.

35
00:02:59,612 --> 00:03:05,776
If you want to think about the metaverse in an entirely different way, I'd recommend considering it like this.

36
00:03:06,443 --> 00:03:09,206
When the internet first became established,

37
00:03:09,206 --> 00:03:11,848
the default way of consuming it was through a desktop computer.

38
00:03:11,848 --> 00:03:13,809
It was also the only way you could consume it.

39
00:03:13,809 --> 00:03:16,772
When smartphones became ubiquitous, however,

40
00:03:16,772 --> 00:03:19,234
their convenience and price went globally.

41
00:03:19,234 --> 00:03:21,956
We moved to a mobile-first world of internet usage.

42
00:03:21,956 --> 00:03:23,998
And the next phase of consumption,

43
00:03:23,998 --> 00:03:26,260
and this is especially for any of you listening

44
00:03:26,260 --> 00:03:29,122
who are tired of or otherwise annoyed

45
00:03:29,122 --> 00:03:31,264
by the constant usage of the term metaverse

46
00:03:31,264 --> 00:03:33,285
in today's entertainment and media coverage,

47
00:03:33,835 --> 00:03:37,417
The next phase could simply be called the immersive internet,

48
00:03:37,417 --> 00:03:39,838
enveloping your field of vision 3D, photo-realistic,

49
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:43,040
and with largely limitless possibilities.

50
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:45,862
That's the promise of the metaverse,

51
00:03:45,862 --> 00:03:47,763
but you don't need to use that word

52
00:03:47,763 --> 00:03:50,264
to understand the ultimate direction of travel

53
00:03:50,264 --> 00:03:51,265
for internet consumption.

54
00:03:51,265 --> 00:03:54,767
Nor do you need to read Snow Crash by Neil Stephenson,

55
00:03:54,767 --> 00:03:55,627
where the term originated.

56
00:03:55,627 --> 00:03:56,708
Although it is a really good novel.

57
00:03:57,550 --> 00:03:59,192
Now, two quick things to say here.

58
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:02,075
One, just because the smartphone is the world's main internet

59
00:04:02,075 --> 00:04:04,798
platform, that doesn't mean desktops are suddenly obsolete.

60
00:04:04,798 --> 00:04:07,882
And the same will be true after immersive internet takes off.

61
00:04:07,882 --> 00:04:09,864
We'll still be using our mobiles and desktops.

62
00:04:10,771 --> 00:04:18,054
Another thing to say is that this immersive version of the Internet becoming the default is a really, really long way off.

63
00:04:18,054 --> 00:04:20,815
We at Omdia typically make five year forecasts.

64
00:04:20,815 --> 00:04:28,358
Immersive Internet becoming the default Internet consumption mode does not feature within them, even if inroads will be made over the next five years.

65
00:04:29,154 --> 00:04:30,776
Now, one reason for this.

66
00:04:30,776 --> 00:04:35,443
Well, a recent article caught my eye because it began like this.

67
00:04:35,443 --> 00:04:39,468
It is hard to imagine humans spending their lives in virtual reality

68
00:04:39,468 --> 00:04:42,052
when the experience amounts to waving your arms about

69
00:04:42,052 --> 00:04:44,956
in the middle of the lounge with a device the size of a house brick

70
00:04:44,956 --> 00:04:45,998
strapped to your face.

71
00:04:46,358 --> 00:04:51,106
Now I'll park the waving your arms around in the lounge bit to focus on the device the size of a

72
00:04:51,106 --> 00:04:55,773
house brick bit because it's certainly worth pointing out but relatively early versions

73
00:04:55,773 --> 00:05:00,681
of devices being massive is very much a part of the history of the evolution of tech.

74
00:05:01,379 --> 00:05:06,900
Therefore, ultimately, what companies with a vested interest in VR and or the metaverse

75
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:12,522
need to achieve is a headset which is broadly speaking as straightforward to put on and

76
00:05:12,522 --> 00:05:14,202
to wear as my pair of glasses.

77
00:05:14,202 --> 00:05:19,703
That's the evolution we still need to happen before we'll get to default version 3.0 of

78
00:05:19,703 --> 00:05:20,844
internet consumption.

79
00:05:20,844 --> 00:05:26,165
That is immersive internet and that virtual shared space where users can do everything

80
00:05:26,165 --> 00:05:27,765
they'd expect from the real world.

81
00:05:28,345 --> 00:05:29,946
That's not to say it won't happen.

82
00:05:29,946 --> 00:05:33,649
And one final way that I think it's useful to look at this

83
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:37,031
is to imagine a games analyst from the past

84
00:05:37,031 --> 00:05:38,652
infusing about some future time

85
00:05:38,652 --> 00:05:42,495
when games would be as beautiful and bold and compelling

86
00:05:42,495 --> 00:05:45,197
and immersive in the deep absorption sense

87
00:05:45,197 --> 00:05:49,520
as say, Breath of the Wild or The Witcher 3

88
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:51,201
or The Last of Us or Elden Ring.

89
00:05:51,201 --> 00:05:53,763
But at the time that he or she is making this point,

90
00:05:53,763 --> 00:05:55,004
the only games they have on offer

91
00:05:55,497 --> 00:05:59,740
look a little bit like this. And there are doubtless plenty of companies out there right

92
00:05:59,740 --> 00:06:05,264
now who deeply regret not paying far more attention to games at this stage here, because

93
00:06:05,264 --> 00:06:10,168
being as those games look like this, they couldn't conceive the end destination for the industry.

94
00:06:10,168 --> 00:06:15,151
And so when you look at a really pretty and inspiring video of a cartoon Mark Zuckerberg

95
00:06:15,151 --> 00:06:19,515
doing a virtual interview in the Metaverse, it's very much worth remembering, but in this analogy,

96
00:06:19,515 --> 00:06:24,718
we're just at or around the 8-bit stage right now, and Elden Ring is the end destination.

97
00:06:26,303 --> 00:06:30,046
So let's use a look at where consumer VR is at right now

98
00:06:30,046 --> 00:06:31,827
as a talking point in and of itself

99
00:06:31,827 --> 00:06:34,269
and as a stepping stone to discuss metaverse games,

100
00:06:34,269 --> 00:06:37,711
which will be the majority of this presentation.

101
00:06:37,711 --> 00:06:39,172
Now, according to Omdyr's data,

102
00:06:39,172 --> 00:06:42,554
the consumer VR market experienced a significant uplift

103
00:06:42,554 --> 00:06:45,576
in 2021, which can be attributed to the success

104
00:06:45,576 --> 00:06:49,219
of the MetaQuest 2 headset and to heightened spending

105
00:06:49,219 --> 00:06:52,461
on gaming hardware and content during the pandemic.

106
00:06:53,293 --> 00:07:00,697
Sales and usage of standalone and tethered VR headsets will be responsible for nearly all of

107
00:07:00,697 --> 00:07:08,662
VR's market value. The global active install base of standalone and tethered VR headsets

108
00:07:08,662 --> 00:07:13,425
is set to grow from 23.3 million in 2021 to 69.1 million in 2026. That's 89%

109
00:07:13,425 --> 00:07:17,147
and 99% of the total consumer VR install base respectively.

110
00:07:17,953 --> 00:07:25,636
Smartphone VR headsets, meanwhile, will decline from a peak of 15.4 million in 2017 to 0.4 million

111
00:07:25,636 --> 00:07:33,298
in 2026. Across the 30 countries in our VR forecast, however, the penetration of VR headsets

112
00:07:33,298 --> 00:07:39,740
stands at only 2.4 per 100 households in 2021. This will grow to just 6.3 per 100 households in

113
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:46,302
2026, highlighting the long road ahead for VR's mass adoption and therefore that of the metaphors.

114
00:07:47,092 --> 00:07:53,874
Nevertheless, at 70 million in 2026, actively used VR headsets are set to be around the number of

115
00:07:53,874 --> 00:07:59,276
Xbox consoles at that time, so not to be sniffed at. Now just to put this into the context of

116
00:07:59,276 --> 00:08:06,138
internet connected devices, VR is a tiny segment and will remain so over the forecast period.

117
00:08:06,138 --> 00:08:11,260
In 2021, 26 million headsets were being actively used by consumers.

118
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:15,362
On average that is one headset for every 204 smartphones.

119
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:21,688
In 2025, Omdia still expects there to be nearly four times as many game consoles

120
00:08:21,688 --> 00:08:24,030
and about 100 times as many smartphones as VR headsets.

121
00:08:24,030 --> 00:08:31,695
Backing this up, according to Omdia's consumer survey carried out in November 2021,

122
00:08:31,695 --> 00:08:35,477
VR headset ownership was ranked similarly low in five leading countries,

123
00:08:35,477 --> 00:08:39,860
with the UK and US slightly ahead of France, Germany and Japan.

124
00:08:40,865 --> 00:08:46,566
Only 5% of respondents overall said that they either owned or had access to a VR headset at

125
00:08:46,566 --> 00:08:52,188
home. This is compared with 41% having game consoles, 57% smart TVs and 88% smartphones.

126
00:08:52,188 --> 00:08:59,470
VR is facing a classic chicken and egg situation where game makers do not want to make enormous

127
00:08:59,470 --> 00:09:03,931
investments because of the low install base of devices,

128
00:09:03,931 --> 00:09:06,752
while consumers are holding out for more appealing content.

129
00:09:07,409 --> 00:09:09,070
And it's important to know that this is changing.

130
00:09:09,070 --> 00:09:13,453
More and more big name studios are dipping their toes into VR.

131
00:09:13,453 --> 00:09:16,595
Meanwhile, VR games such as Beat Saber and Half-Life Alyx

132
00:09:16,595 --> 00:09:19,617
have become true breakout successes.

133
00:09:19,617 --> 00:09:22,559
VR content revenue is inherently tied to the VR headset

134
00:09:22,559 --> 00:09:23,240
and store base, of course.

135
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:26,622
The shift towards more capable and engaging headsets

136
00:09:26,622 --> 00:09:30,525
is a positive development because more content revenue

137
00:09:30,525 --> 00:09:32,086
will be generated by each headset.

138
00:09:33,025 --> 00:09:44,711
As the size of the consumer VR install base becomes substantial, it will attract more

139
00:09:44,711 --> 00:09:51,174
game developer and content creator interest.

140
00:09:52,172 --> 00:09:55,874
but it's also more capable and affordable standalone VR headsets,

141
00:09:55,874 --> 00:09:58,875
which offer significantly better overall user experience

142
00:09:58,875 --> 00:10:03,036
thanks to inside-out tracking, two-hand controllers,

143
00:10:03,036 --> 00:10:05,837
better graphics, and more ergonomic design.

144
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:09,739
Importantly, they are user-friendly and require little setup or upgrade.

145
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:15,401
Another driver, PC-tethered headsets are pushing the boundaries of VR technology,

146
00:10:15,401 --> 00:10:19,523
with PC VR titles like Half-Life Alyx showcasing what VR is capable of.

147
00:10:20,599 --> 00:10:25,942
Finally, we would cite Sony's perseverance and success with PlayStation VR.

148
00:10:25,942 --> 00:10:33,726
The install base of PS4 consoles, bundling and a continued marketing push has made VR desirable among console gamers.

149
00:10:33,726 --> 00:10:36,708
PSVR 2 will be eagerly awaited by PS5 console owners.

150
00:10:36,708 --> 00:10:42,391
I'm just going to have a quick look at the letter first advertising now,

151
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:47,614
because it seems an undercovered area and is relevant to people working in the games industry.

152
00:10:48,609 --> 00:10:55,256
Meta's recent patent allocations include reference to personalised advertising within AR environments,

153
00:10:55,256 --> 00:10:59,361
and by extension, the AR and VR-enabled Metaverse.

154
00:10:59,361 --> 00:11:03,685
They also include a potential new Metaverse-led ad format whereby a third party

155
00:11:03,685 --> 00:11:07,510
would be able to sponsor the appearance of an object within a virtual store.

156
00:11:08,782 --> 00:11:12,663
The new context for VR and AR provide for advertising

157
00:11:12,663 --> 00:11:14,143
mean that there are significant opportunities

158
00:11:14,143 --> 00:11:15,623
for such ads in the metaverse.

159
00:11:15,623 --> 00:11:18,424
These advances will also lead to a much more granular

160
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:21,105
and potentially more effective ad measurement

161
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:23,665
and targeting ecosystem.

162
00:11:23,665 --> 00:11:26,266
Now, while AR, VR advertising may not

163
00:11:26,266 --> 00:11:28,067
present a sizable opportunity now,

164
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:34,064
it could easily become the largest ad medium within the next 10 to 20 years.

165
00:11:34,064 --> 00:11:37,747
Consider that slide I showed earlier, tracking the default internet consumption modes.

166
00:11:37,747 --> 00:11:43,792
Internet advertising has followed this path, first with wired advertising dominating at the expense

167
00:11:43,792 --> 00:11:48,876
of traditional ad media, and then with mobile advertising rapidly rising to overtake wired.

168
00:11:48,876 --> 00:11:52,959
Now at present, only Meta is investing substantially in anticipation of this new

169
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:56,422
opportunity, and as such is in a position to dominate.

170
00:11:57,263 --> 00:12:00,325
We've already seen the decline or even demise of much of the old media guard

171
00:12:00,325 --> 00:12:05,028
that failed to react quickly enough to the shift from traditional to digital media.

172
00:12:05,028 --> 00:12:07,490
The same could happen to today's digital incumbents

173
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,611
if they don't keep up with the shift to the metaverse.

174
00:12:09,611 --> 00:12:15,014
So it's essential that ad-reliant players looking to operate within the metaverse

175
00:12:15,014 --> 00:12:18,297
start laying their foundations now if they wish to compete.

176
00:12:18,297 --> 00:12:21,639
Developing new ad formats that thrive in the VR-driven metaverse

177
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:23,260
will be a critical part of the puzzle.

178
00:12:23,946 --> 00:12:27,748
Although they don't currently have all the answers,

179
00:12:27,748 --> 00:12:30,289
vendors providing dynamic in-game ad products,

180
00:12:30,289 --> 00:12:33,710
which bear many similarities with AR, VR, and metaverse ads,

181
00:12:33,710 --> 00:12:34,951
will have a head start in this pursuit.

182
00:12:34,951 --> 00:12:38,012
As a result, they will likely prove attractive acquisition

183
00:12:38,012 --> 00:12:39,693
prospects for players looking to develop

184
00:12:39,693 --> 00:12:43,495
their own metaverse advertising businesses and technology.

185
00:12:47,783 --> 00:12:53,125
So that has been a digest of the future of the metaverse and the noise surrounding it.

186
00:12:53,125 --> 00:12:56,327
Now, analysts don't mind noise per se, but they much prefer numbers,

187
00:12:56,327 --> 00:12:59,809
which is why I now want to turn my attention to the present and the different angle.

188
00:12:59,809 --> 00:13:06,772
The vastness of scope required to fully realise the metaverse could only really be achieved by one of the tech giants.

189
00:13:06,772 --> 00:13:12,315
However, that's not to say that other companies shouldn't try or haven't tried to create their own version of it.

190
00:13:12,315 --> 00:13:16,136
This is the distinction between the metaverse and a metaverse.

191
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:23,472
Now, the natural immersivity of games worlds makes them incredibly strong starting points for the concept of a metaverse.

192
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:31,716
In recent years, various games have emerged which seek to offer a range of entertainment, social and cultural activities inside their own worlds,

193
00:13:31,716 --> 00:13:38,540
while also providing a functioning economy that includes commerce between users and from other brands.

194
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,601
Metaverses, by any other name.

195
00:13:40,815 --> 00:13:46,118
In September 2021, we at Omdyr launched the Metaverse Games Benchmark with the aim of

196
00:13:46,118 --> 00:13:51,482
identifying and categorising the critical factors needed to create a metaverse.

197
00:13:51,482 --> 00:13:56,866
This is what it looks like, by the way, but since Excel isn't the most thrilling program

198
00:13:56,866 --> 00:13:58,487
to share, I will flip back to PowerPoint.

199
00:14:01,901 --> 00:14:06,564
So for this benchmark, we ranked six games against a set of defined factors.

200
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:10,267
The games were Minecraft, Fortnite, Roblox, Dreams, Core and Zepeto.

201
00:14:10,267 --> 00:14:11,667
Three of those are too big to ignore.

202
00:14:11,667 --> 00:14:17,171
The others were included because they have various very interesting elements

203
00:14:17,171 --> 00:14:22,134
to them that it would be useful for games companies with metaverse

204
00:14:22,134 --> 00:14:24,516
aspirations to be mindful of.

205
00:14:24,516 --> 00:14:28,078
Incidentally, here's a list of games I have my eye on for potential addition

206
00:14:28,078 --> 00:14:30,240
when we come to the biggest fresh a little later in 2022.

207
00:14:30,775 --> 00:14:32,897
These would include Decentraland,

208
00:14:32,897 --> 00:14:36,239
so that's a VR platform built on the Ethereum blockchain

209
00:14:36,239 --> 00:14:39,081
where parcels of land can be bought and sold.

210
00:14:39,081 --> 00:14:42,963
That only had casino games at the time of consideration.

211
00:14:42,963 --> 00:14:46,085
Facebook Horizon, VR social space and game creation title,

212
00:14:46,085 --> 00:14:47,206
strong candidate for future inclusion.

213
00:14:47,206 --> 00:14:48,727
Sensorian Galaxy, the Swell ES,

214
00:14:48,727 --> 00:14:50,508
VR social platform,

215
00:14:50,508 --> 00:14:54,310
initially concentrating on music and mindfulness,

216
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,911
but with game mechanics in place.

217
00:14:55,911 --> 00:14:57,833
That was in closed beta at the time of our work.

218
00:14:58,679 --> 00:15:03,302
Second Life, created in 2003, of course, and sees high potential for growth right now,

219
00:15:03,302 --> 00:15:06,284
given the popularity of the metaverse concept at present.

220
00:15:06,284 --> 00:15:13,028
Undawn, forthcoming multiplayer survival game from Tencent, with avatars, UGC platforms,

221
00:15:13,028 --> 00:15:19,292
and the capacity for players to upload their own photos to create an identity in the virtual world.

222
00:15:19,292 --> 00:15:23,795
And finally, Rec Room, the orange logo, a VR or non-VR game with an inspired game creation system.

223
00:15:24,886 --> 00:15:30,648
So in terms of the six titles that we did look at, these were scored and ranked in terms of five core areas.

224
00:15:30,648 --> 00:15:36,790
The scale that they were able to provide, the sophistication or otherwise of their monetisation,

225
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:42,552
the range and quality of entertainment they provided, the capacity to interact in the games world,

226
00:15:42,552 --> 00:15:46,673
and the current and potential technology offering they had brought to bear.

227
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:50,448
Each of these, as you see, was split into subcategories,

228
00:15:50,448 --> 00:15:55,432
and this ranking was, after a very long period of research

229
00:15:55,432 --> 00:15:57,513
and discussion, deemed the best framework

230
00:15:57,513 --> 00:16:00,816
at this current time for assessing the quality,

231
00:16:00,816 --> 00:16:02,157
or otherwise, of an aspirant metaverse game type.

232
00:16:02,157 --> 00:16:05,941
Here's the depth we went into per subcategory, incidentally,

233
00:16:05,941 --> 00:16:08,983
so something of a labor of love.

234
00:16:08,983 --> 00:16:11,785
Let's then look at how each type of category,

235
00:16:11,785 --> 00:16:13,026
and we'll start with scale.

236
00:16:13,730 --> 00:16:16,211
that all of Minecraft, Fortnite, and Roblox

237
00:16:16,211 --> 00:16:18,271
would be classed as enormous games

238
00:16:18,271 --> 00:16:20,372
by any imaginable metric.

239
00:16:20,372 --> 00:16:22,473
Minecraft takes this category,

240
00:16:22,473 --> 00:16:25,534
on account of its record-breaking game sales,

241
00:16:25,534 --> 00:16:27,555
on top of huge figures for mobile downloads

242
00:16:27,555 --> 00:16:29,296
on the two main app stores,

243
00:16:29,296 --> 00:16:30,897
plus its large popularity in China,

244
00:16:30,897 --> 00:16:33,518
where it's thought to have been downloaded

245
00:16:33,518 --> 00:16:34,058
more than 400 million times.

246
00:16:35,373 --> 00:16:41,658
Those 200 million plus users still represent a reasonable gap between this type of discovery,

247
00:16:41,658 --> 00:16:45,181
and like Roblox and Minecraft, the audience skews young.

248
00:16:45,181 --> 00:16:50,366
Meanwhile, Dreams' model cries out for free-to-play price points and cross-platform availability,

249
00:16:50,366 --> 00:16:55,610
but has neither at present. It's only available on PlayStation for mid-tier titles RRP.

250
00:16:55,610 --> 00:17:03,037
Core will be really interesting to watch as it continues to build scale following its April 2021 launch.

251
00:17:03,037 --> 00:17:04,178
Moving on to monetization.

252
00:17:04,726 --> 00:17:09,269
Roblox takes the win thanks to having the most advanced in-game economy of the titles ranked

253
00:17:09,269 --> 00:17:15,194
here with both game experiences and individual items able to be sold and numerous brands taking

254
00:17:15,194 --> 00:17:22,159
the opportunity to sell in the game world. Gucci, Nike and the NFL among them. Fortnite has a strong

255
00:17:22,159 --> 00:17:28,103
array of in-game items for sale but not the user commerce of Roblox. Well, Zepeto puts a major

256
00:17:28,103 --> 00:17:32,406
emphasis on users buying and selling both very strong brand partnerships.

257
00:17:33,234 --> 00:17:38,899
Minecraft has limitations here but Minecraft Marketplace is pretty lucrative for modders.

258
00:17:38,899 --> 00:17:44,924
Now one of the most intriguing aspects about Core is its very favourable revenue share of 50% with

259
00:17:44,924 --> 00:17:50,968
creators and the choice of payment systems for them to set from monthly subscription to pay-to-play

260
00:17:50,968 --> 00:17:56,513
or in-game purchases. There's also a perk system to pay creators based on number of plays.

261
00:17:56,513 --> 00:18:00,957
Dreams has a limited program for creators to monetize their work with scope to improve on

262
00:18:00,957 --> 00:18:01,497
that front.

263
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:06,213
But when it comes to entertainment, it's Dreams that we felt merited the win.

264
00:18:06,213 --> 00:18:10,416
Dreams has rich games, including Showcase, Artstream, and a host of titles that have a

265
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:15,960
triple-A look built by its dedicated users. But it's the range of possible in-title entertainment

266
00:18:15,960 --> 00:18:22,225
where Dreams really comes to the fore, with music videos, animated shorts and series,

267
00:18:22,225 --> 00:18:27,489
sculptures, art galleries, and a massive amount of cool. Fortnite's main title,

268
00:18:27,489 --> 00:18:31,472
fairly recent additions such as Fortnite Impulse.

269
00:18:32,729 --> 00:18:36,514
a range of class-leading live events, most notably with Ariana Grande,

270
00:18:36,514 --> 00:18:42,142
put it in second ahead of Roblox, which has more than 40 million user-generated games available

271
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:47,709
but reasonably simplistic graphical quality. Roblox only trails Fortnite in terms of live events,

272
00:18:47,709 --> 00:18:49,652
thanks to efforts such as its Zara Larsson comp.

273
00:18:51,453 --> 00:18:58,120
Minecraft's Block by Blockwest music festival shows clear intention to offer compelling live experiences.

274
00:18:58,120 --> 00:19:04,447
Cepeto has focused on interactivity in its events, with strong fandom opportunities and recent link-ups with K-pop bands.

275
00:19:04,447 --> 00:19:10,393
Its game offering is the weakest of the six, but it did announce a game creation system in June 2021.

276
00:19:11,244 --> 00:19:15,409
Core, which already has a good variety of rich-looking games, sees the potential of live

277
00:19:15,409 --> 00:19:20,495
events too, so its progress here will be interesting to track. Indeed, after the benchmark was completed,

278
00:19:20,495 --> 00:19:29,025
the musician Deadmau5 announced a permanent residency within Core in his Oberhausle virtual world.

279
00:19:29,025 --> 00:19:32,028
In interaction, that's social utility, identity.

280
00:19:32,932 --> 00:19:37,794
Fortnite comes out on top with a cross-platform chat service, the Party Royale area, and huge

281
00:19:37,794 --> 00:19:40,456
potential in the shape of a fixed live League of Legends base.

282
00:19:40,456 --> 00:19:47,340
Fortnite Creative has also made efforts towards education, with the likes of the March Through

283
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:49,321
Time Civil Rights Experience.

284
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:55,584
Roblox, which places second as Party Place, a popular site for virtual parties, while

285
00:19:55,584 --> 00:19:59,606
it bought chat platform Guildit in August 2021, and its acquisition of Loom.ai was made

286
00:19:59,606 --> 00:20:02,168
with a view to improving avatar realism.

287
00:20:02,875 --> 00:20:11,140
In November, again after this was finished, it announced three new educational games aimed at middle school, high school and college students.

288
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:19,306
Zepeto is at its core a social network and also scores highest for identity with such a heavy emphasis on self-expression through avatars.

289
00:20:19,306 --> 00:20:24,869
Minecraft is inherently collaborative and takes the highest marks for utility, thanks in part to its education addition.

290
00:20:26,551 --> 00:20:31,054
And finally, technology, which features the lowest high scores.

291
00:20:31,054 --> 00:20:34,375
That's because, as we've said, the most successful metastasis

292
00:20:34,375 --> 00:20:38,358
will of course ultimately be rooted in virtual or at least mixed reality.

293
00:20:38,358 --> 00:20:41,800
But take up and tech are not at the point to satisfactorily achieve this yet.

294
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:46,222
Fortnite leads thanks to Epic's ownership of companies like Quixel,

295
00:20:46,222 --> 00:20:50,865
it's real world environment scanners, and Freelateral and Cubic Motion,

296
00:20:50,865 --> 00:20:53,427
both digital avatar specialists.

297
00:20:54,378 --> 00:20:58,542
Next Place Minecraft has wide VR and even Windows Mixed Reality headset support,

298
00:20:58,542 --> 00:21:06,190
but the discontinuation of Minecraft Earth demonstrates that success in AR is no fait accompli.

299
00:21:06,190 --> 00:21:08,692
Roblox has an eight-figure amount of VR games available,

300
00:21:08,692 --> 00:21:16,220
but is hampered by the fact that those games don't lend themselves to full-dimensional immersivity in a way that Dreams and Core do.

301
00:21:17,057 --> 00:21:23,659
Zepeto makes good use of AR in its title, and is able to place avatars in real space

302
00:21:23,659 --> 00:21:28,680
for its functionality. However, it lags on VR, even if this has been named as the long-term

303
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:29,580
strategy.

304
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:33,861
And when you put it all together, it looks like this. These scores are out of 50. So

305
00:21:33,861 --> 00:21:38,403
we have Fortnite, with Roblox in first place, with Minecraft not far behind.

306
00:21:39,586 --> 00:21:43,389
To recap, it's Fortnite's hugely strong old court game,

307
00:21:43,389 --> 00:21:47,451
its experimentation and its innovation with live events

308
00:21:47,451 --> 00:21:49,193
that was a key contributor to its success.

309
00:21:49,193 --> 00:21:51,014
Roblox, meanwhile, is the clear leader

310
00:21:51,014 --> 00:21:52,115
when it comes to in-game economy,

311
00:21:52,115 --> 00:21:54,336
with a highly evolved approach

312
00:21:54,336 --> 00:21:56,438
to commerce and brand activation,

313
00:21:56,438 --> 00:21:58,879
while making increasing inroads into providing

314
00:21:58,879 --> 00:22:00,420
permissible live experiences.

315
00:22:01,304 --> 00:22:05,207
And with various features announced after this benchmark was made,

316
00:22:05,207 --> 00:22:09,090
the free educational titles I mentioned, the addition of Metaverse eSports,

317
00:22:09,090 --> 00:22:13,453
and the likes of Nikeland, a Nike-owned world for games and retail,

318
00:22:13,453 --> 00:22:17,396
launched at Roblox in late 2021, I suspect it's going to be even closer

319
00:22:17,396 --> 00:22:20,958
when we come to update this benchmark in a few months' time.

320
00:22:20,958 --> 00:22:21,078
Now...

321
00:22:22,145 --> 00:22:30,571
The titles in this benchmark are striving to provide a rounded offering in order to attract users and retain them for ever longer periods in their game worlds.

322
00:22:30,571 --> 00:22:37,797
That in turn requires them to partner with rights holders and celebrities across the world of entertainment.

323
00:22:37,797 --> 00:22:44,262
In July 2021, for example, Roblox struck a deal with Sony Music to offer new commercial opportunities for its artists.

324
00:22:45,033 --> 00:22:48,156
In June 2021, it reached an agreement with another music company, BMG.

325
00:22:48,156 --> 00:22:53,340
For their part, this was a reaction to being sued for alleged enablement of piracy

326
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,643
by the National Music Publishers Association.

327
00:22:56,643 --> 00:23:01,207
It's imperative for Metaverse Games to boast a raft of entertainment while respecting copyright.

328
00:23:01,207 --> 00:23:06,451
And they also have the immense scale of complementary aims to make partnering worthwhile.

329
00:23:06,451 --> 00:23:10,975
The NMPA suit, for example, was dropped in September 2021 in favour of a partnership.

330
00:23:11,962 --> 00:23:20,147
Licensing deals in music, TV, film, other video games, sports, comics and manga will all further

331
00:23:20,147 --> 00:23:25,911
enrich a fortnight or a call. Radio, podcasts and audiobooks could be next on the list,

332
00:23:25,911 --> 00:23:30,794
as could tie-ins with news and magazine outlets. Among many other elements,

333
00:23:30,794 --> 00:23:34,836
Metaverse Games offer a new platform to bring entertainment offerings directly to millions of

334
00:23:34,836 --> 00:23:39,119
users, so companies across the entertainment space should sit up and take notice.

335
00:23:41,008 --> 00:23:48,533
Another key function of the Metaverse is to act as a quantifiable tool for brands and other non-native companies to games

336
00:23:48,533 --> 00:23:54,597
who are looking to understand which games best fit their need to find effective outlets for digital opportunities

337
00:23:54,597 --> 00:23:56,518
and which are rapidly equipping to do so.

338
00:23:56,518 --> 00:24:02,342
Metaverse games have opened up new digital shopfronts with a massive potential customer base.

339
00:24:03,094 --> 00:24:08,059
Zepeto, in particular, with the prominence it gives to detailed avatar personalisation

340
00:24:08,059 --> 00:24:12,344
and openness to third parties, has enabled clothing and makeup brands to offer digital

341
00:24:12,344 --> 00:24:17,469
goods. Gucci, Ralph Lauren, Dior Beauty, they've all been among earlier adopters here.

342
00:24:17,469 --> 00:24:23,176
Other fashion brands, or any clothing brands, should be strongly considering action.

343
00:24:23,780 --> 00:24:27,521
Quite apart from the thousands of users selling their own self-conceived content,

344
00:24:27,521 --> 00:24:30,823
there are upstart digital fashion companies such as Bora Boros,

345
00:24:30,823 --> 00:24:35,245
who are now providing clothing ideas expressly tailored to digital worlds.

346
00:24:35,245 --> 00:24:38,386
Why would it stop at fashion brands in terms of decorating avatars?

347
00:24:38,386 --> 00:24:42,808
If you have a brand that people want to associate with in the digital world,

348
00:24:42,808 --> 00:24:48,191
it's relatively uncomplicated to have that logo or slogan on an item of virtual clothing.

349
00:24:48,191 --> 00:24:52,633
At the same time, current and aspirant metaphors games should be learned.

350
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:58,211
our best position themselves to enable them to partner with brands in future.

351
00:24:58,211 --> 00:25:05,973
I'm going to leave you with this slide because it's the maximum current score available out of

352
00:25:05,973 --> 00:25:09,874
50 if you combine the best bits of each game as per our ranking system. It therefore should

353
00:25:09,874 --> 00:25:14,956
serve as a good inspiration for any plans people have to create their own Metaverse aspirant game.

354
00:25:14,956 --> 00:25:22,538
Naturally there are still great ideas to be had. Things that we believe work well include

355
00:25:23,422 --> 00:25:27,444
Roblox's rich economy, allowing commerce for brands and creators alike.

356
00:25:27,444 --> 00:25:32,607
Mixed with cause, revenue share and price model flexibility for games makers.

357
00:25:32,607 --> 00:25:37,090
Fortnite's drive for platform agnosticity and emphasis on compelling live events,

358
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:43,093
wedded to Dreams' high quality game experiences and wider entertainment mix.

359
00:25:43,093 --> 00:25:47,835
Zepeto's emphasis on self-expression and the wider commercial opportunities that brings,

360
00:25:47,835 --> 00:25:50,157
plus its efforts to facilitate fandom.

361
00:25:53,538 --> 00:26:00,783
improvement for a future of extended reality. I hope this is something worth keeping in mind

362
00:26:00,783 --> 00:26:05,787
for any company right now with short, medium or long-term plans to create a metaphors type

363
00:26:05,787 --> 00:26:13,853
platform and I hope this talk has helped in terms of understanding where games companies fit in to

364
00:26:13,853 --> 00:26:18,516
the metaphors. Thanks very much for your time today, I've left a few minutes for any questions.

365
00:26:29,916 --> 00:26:31,296
Dob, are you ready for some Q&A?

366
00:26:31,296 --> 00:26:43,259
I said, yeah, yeah, that's fine.

367
00:26:43,259 --> 00:26:45,399
Hey, good morning.

368
00:26:45,399 --> 00:26:46,840
My name is Phil Laganis.

369
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:51,101
I'm currently one year in production on a VR game.

370
00:26:51,101 --> 00:26:55,221
And we're looking to launch anywhere between August

371
00:26:55,221 --> 00:26:56,542
and December this year.

372
00:26:56,542 --> 00:26:57,842
And we're kind of on.

373
00:26:58,490 --> 00:27:01,651
thinking about ways and what to do and all those things.

374
00:27:01,651 --> 00:27:06,853
We're thinking about our goals to get on the meta platform, submit to Oculus.

375
00:27:06,853 --> 00:27:09,694
And but we're kind of worried about now the backup plan.

376
00:27:09,694 --> 00:27:10,955
Like, what if they say no?

377
00:27:10,955 --> 00:27:12,415
What if everybody says no? Right.

378
00:27:12,415 --> 00:27:13,816
What are we going to do?

379
00:27:13,816 --> 00:27:17,897
And I'm looking at the metaverse and I had this idea

380
00:27:17,897 --> 00:27:21,119
and I wanted to get your thoughts on it.

381
00:27:21,119 --> 00:27:21,879
We're thinking about.

382
00:27:22,782 --> 00:27:26,805
contacted as many people that own digital properties in the metaverse.

383
00:27:26,805 --> 00:27:29,246
You mentioned the galleries earlier in their talk.

384
00:27:29,246 --> 00:27:32,669
And, um, we were thinking about, cause our game is kind of arcadey.

385
00:27:32,669 --> 00:27:34,730
It's a shooter on rails, skill based shooter on rails.

386
00:27:34,730 --> 00:27:39,013
And we were thinking about just going to contacting all those owners and putting

387
00:27:39,013 --> 00:27:41,655
our game on their metaverse plots.

388
00:27:41,655 --> 00:27:45,897
And basically people can play it with, um, like arcade style, putting

389
00:27:45,897 --> 00:27:47,518
the quarters in the machine.

390
00:27:47,518 --> 00:27:50,340
And then a percentage of all that money put in through the week.

391
00:27:51,048 --> 00:27:56,972
will be on weekly leaderboards and will pay out a percentage of the people who are top

392
00:27:56,972 --> 00:27:58,252
on the leaderboards.

393
00:27:58,252 --> 00:28:04,757
So it creates a almost like a competition tournament every week and we just go from

394
00:28:04,757 --> 00:28:09,880
plot to plot to plot and just have everybody playing arcade style.

395
00:28:09,880 --> 00:28:15,844
Do you think this is possible in the metaverse and do you have any insight on how we could

396
00:28:15,844 --> 00:28:16,564
go about doing that?

397
00:28:17,788 --> 00:28:24,191
That's fascinating. I think it's a really good use case for the metaverse. I don't know if it's

398
00:28:24,191 --> 00:28:30,834
possible right now, but I think it certainly will be if it's not. What I would say is that for people

399
00:28:30,834 --> 00:28:36,117
to want to come to the metaverse, they want something to do. And I haven't spoken much

400
00:28:36,117 --> 00:28:40,619
about competitive elements, but that is one way to keep people coming, to have a leaderboard,

401
00:28:40,619 --> 00:28:44,981
beat your score, beat your friends. Those are always things which bring people back for more

402
00:28:44,981 --> 00:28:47,322
and more in games, and the same would be true.

403
00:28:47,742 --> 00:28:49,644
in the metaverse as well.

404
00:28:49,644 --> 00:28:53,647
I think I was thinking of core when you mentioned it

405
00:28:53,647 --> 00:28:57,170
as an interesting platform to investigate.

406
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,332
Because yeah, if you want to build scale quickly,

407
00:28:59,332 --> 00:29:00,693
it's difficult, of course it is.

408
00:29:00,693 --> 00:29:02,655
But if you want to see if, you know,

409
00:29:02,655 --> 00:29:05,357
another company would like to host your game,

410
00:29:05,357 --> 00:29:07,599
then that might be something that might happen.

411
00:29:07,599 --> 00:29:09,680
You know, also think of Epic who are so open.

412
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:16,483
you know, they really do emphasize interoperability and the idea of cross-platform play.

413
00:29:16,483 --> 00:29:23,866
So those might be companies to look at. I'm sort of aware of, I think this sort of cuts off right on the hour.

414
00:29:23,866 --> 00:29:26,707
So I will better, I better leave it there.

415
00:29:26,707 --> 00:29:31,008
But you've got my email address on that slide there. And I'm more than happy to follow up with you.

416
00:29:31,008 --> 00:29:32,969
But good luck in your endeavours. That sounds really interesting.

417
00:29:38,296 --> 00:29:40,157
It looks like we have one more question.

418
00:29:40,157 --> 00:29:41,017
Dom?

419
00:29:41,017 --> 00:29:41,257
OK.

420
00:29:41,257 --> 00:29:44,079
Hello.

421
00:29:44,079 --> 00:29:46,760
That was great to have the presentation

422
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:48,681
and all about the metaverse.

423
00:29:48,681 --> 00:29:51,722
So my name is Asad, and I am the founder of Immersive Ads.

424
00:29:51,722 --> 00:29:54,964
Just like you told about all the monetization,

425
00:29:54,964 --> 00:29:57,625
everything pertaining to the metaverse,

426
00:29:57,625 --> 00:30:00,686
primarily that's what we are really interested in as well,

427
00:30:00,686 --> 00:30:02,547
as in doing ads for the metaverse

428
00:30:02,547 --> 00:30:05,148
and all the 3D environments for which people make games.

429
00:30:05,836 --> 00:30:10,998
What we have seen up till now is most of a brand advertising that you would expect on

430
00:30:10,998 --> 00:30:16,021
Metaverse and all that VR games and all the virtual environments.

431
00:30:16,021 --> 00:30:20,923
Whereas in the current scenario of advertising, there is a lot of call to action as well,

432
00:30:20,923 --> 00:30:21,784
right?

433
00:30:21,784 --> 00:30:25,866
People want to promote the content, there's performance marketing, and they expect some

434
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,768
action to be done against which they need to be paid.

435
00:30:30,506 --> 00:30:35,771
However, what do you think it's going to be like in the VR or the metaverse?

436
00:30:35,771 --> 00:30:40,256
And how would the call to action to those ads would happen?

437
00:30:40,256 --> 00:30:45,160
Because what we have created right now is something really interesting that as soon

438
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:49,004
as you get nearer to an ad, it becomes responsive, it becomes actionable.

439
00:30:49,004 --> 00:30:49,985
So would that really help?

440
00:30:51,945 --> 00:30:56,928
Sounds it's that sounds yeah, that sounds like the sort of thing that works.

441
00:30:56,928 --> 00:30:59,469
I mean, I was we've you can see Meta's patents.

442
00:30:59,469 --> 00:31:02,611
They have been sort of or some of them at least have been revealed.

443
00:31:02,611 --> 00:31:05,272
So you can have a look through what they've been doing.

444
00:31:05,272 --> 00:31:07,313
But they're doing very similar stuff to that.

445
00:31:07,313 --> 00:31:09,255
I'm not sure I heard that exact one.

446
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:11,676
But I think location based.

447
00:31:11,816 --> 00:31:15,558
it calls to action. Yeah, that definitely works. I mean, you see that actually in digital out-of-home

448
00:31:15,558 --> 00:31:24,643
media a lot. So yeah, I think that's a translatable idea. And, you know, I necessarily gave a little

449
00:31:24,643 --> 00:31:31,067
bit of time to advertising metaphors because A, that's surely how meta is going to, you know,

450
00:31:31,067 --> 00:31:38,411
model things and therefore it can be a kind of a real way of propelling the monetization model,

451
00:31:38,411 --> 00:31:40,112
really, of the metaverse.

452
00:31:41,312 --> 00:31:58,040
And yeah, B, there are so many opportunities for companies such as yourselves who have, you know, ways of doing location based or even, you know, maybe I don't know if you've got eye tracking based advertising options available.

453
00:31:58,040 --> 00:31:58,441
But yeah, if so.

454
00:31:59,101 --> 00:32:05,585
I think you've got a head start. So, yeah, again, that's two really interesting people

455
00:32:05,585 --> 00:32:12,088
involved in this. So, yeah, I look forward to hearing from you in future as to how you're

456
00:32:12,088 --> 00:32:16,391
getting on there. Oh, cool. So I'll just follow up on that with you. Thank you very much.

457
00:32:16,391 --> 00:32:25,076
All right. Thank you, Dom. Appreciate it. Thank you all very much for your time.
