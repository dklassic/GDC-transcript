00:00:06,565 --> 00:00:08,807
Hello, I am Tyreek Plummer.

2
00:00:08,807 --> 00:00:10,148
I am a game designer and artist.

3
00:00:10,148 --> 00:00:13,170
I'm going to be talking today about 2D animation,

4
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:16,753
which is maybe my second favorite thing in the world.

5
00:00:17,511 --> 00:00:22,014
If you're interested in animation but don't know where to start, or are struggling to get things to look right,

6
00:00:22,014 --> 00:00:26,798
or if you understand some of the basics but just feel like you could use some tips in applying the principles,

7
00:00:26,798 --> 00:00:29,620
hopefully this will be a helpful screed.

8
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:35,264
I also hope this will be helpful to people who work with animators and other non-artist people who make project scope decisions,

9
00:00:35,264 --> 00:00:43,991
to provide some common language, things to consider, things to watch out for when assessing animated objects and assets,

10
00:00:43,991 --> 00:00:46,493
and some tips for working with artists.

11
00:00:49,573 --> 00:00:54,837
I've worked as an animator in games for about 12 years now on titles like Thor, God of Thunder,

12
00:00:54,837 --> 00:00:59,320
Epic Mickey, The Power of Illusion, Adventure Time, Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't

13
00:00:59,320 --> 00:01:03,863
Know, and Cadence of Hyrule, Crypt of the Necrodancer featuring the Legend of Zelda.

14
00:01:03,863 --> 00:01:09,707
A lot of games with colons followed by long subtitles for some reason.

15
00:01:11,170 --> 00:01:16,154
I'm also the creator of Catacomb Kids, which is a platformer roguelike that I've been working

16
00:01:16,154 --> 00:01:18,316
on for going on 300 years now.

17
00:01:18,316 --> 00:01:22,739
I mostly work in pixel art, but I don't think that'll color this talk too much because really

18
00:01:22,739 --> 00:01:27,083
animation is animation and the fundamentals don't change all that much from one medium

19
00:01:27,083 --> 00:01:29,845
to the next, even if specific techniques and tools might.

20
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,411
And this is going to be a talk largely about the fundamentals of animation as they apply to game art.

21
00:01:36,411 --> 00:01:41,333
I will also preface this by saying these are all just things I've gleaned from my own personal

22
00:01:41,333 --> 00:01:45,274
experience working as an animator. I'm not like any kind of super authority or anything,

23
00:01:45,274 --> 00:01:50,996
it's just something that I care deeply about and I have a lot of opinions about what happens to be my

24
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:57,658
second favorite thing that I also happen to do for a living. Which is to say, please also learn from

25
00:01:58,219 --> 00:02:04,221
other animators and people who are better than me, there are a lot of them and I'm sure they all have

26
00:02:04,221 --> 00:02:08,662
opinions that they think are right too. That being the case, let's start off with some general

27
00:02:08,662 --> 00:02:13,444
considerations. Before you even begin working on art for your game, there are some things

28
00:02:13,444 --> 00:02:16,605
to consider with regards to 2D art and animation.

29
00:02:19,179 --> 00:02:30,290
Like most aesthetic decisions in life, a lot of a lot of it comes down to what you want to communicate, what mood you want to impress upon others, what story you're trying to tell.

30
00:02:30,290 --> 00:02:42,982
But you also need to be aware of the kind of game you're trying to make on a technical level and the challenges associated with your medium of choice, because any aesthetic decision is going to be a technical one as well.

31
00:02:43,535 --> 00:03:01,928
If you're going to need to sprite, if you're going to need every sprite to have 12 fully animated facing directions and hundreds of kinds of fully rendered equipment that will be layered and animated and mixed and matched, I feel like at that point you might be better served by just using 3D assets to save everybody time and migraines.

32
00:03:02,329 --> 00:03:06,674
Or if your art style isn't incredibly detailed to the point where drawing a single frame is

33
00:03:06,674 --> 00:03:11,559
equivalent to a full day's work, maybe be aware of how that's going to impact the quantity of

34
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:17,086
art that can be made and plan around keeping any animation to an absolute bare minimum.

35
00:03:17,086 --> 00:03:22,692
Or opt for a skeletal system where each highly detailed bit needs to be drawn only once or twice.

36
00:03:23,558 --> 00:03:26,118
But of course, that'll come with its own set of challenges.

37
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:30,700
Or you could simplify the style to better fit within the limitations

38
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:33,020
of traditional frame by frame animation.

39
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:33,820
These are all valid options,

40
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:39,502
but they're things that need to be decided upon early and trust artists

41
00:03:39,502 --> 00:03:42,442
when they tell you what's reasonable and what's not.

42
00:03:42,442 --> 00:03:46,383
Nobody likes working for hours, days or weeks to make something

43
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:49,824
that ends up thrown out because the limitations of their medium

44
00:03:49,824 --> 00:03:51,785
weren't properly considered early on.

45
00:03:52,585 --> 00:03:56,526
2D animation can be very time consuming and if you don't account for this in your design,

46
00:03:56,526 --> 00:04:01,768
you're going to have a bad time. A very long, crunch-filled bad time.

47
00:04:01,768 --> 00:04:07,890
So let's say you've made those considerations, you've picked a style that works, you understand

48
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:13,111
the implications and you have decided you're going to go for it. 2D art, traditionally animated,

49
00:04:13,111 --> 00:04:17,893
nice. So when you're animating, when you're breathing life into these still images,

50
00:04:17,893 --> 00:04:21,454
making them act and react, what is it that you're actually doing?

51
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:25,058
Well, animation isn't just make thing look good,

52
00:04:25,058 --> 00:04:27,779
although that's definitely usually a part of it.

53
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,479
Animation is communication,

54
00:04:29,479 --> 00:04:33,000
communication of ideas through motion.

55
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:36,201
A character's idle animation can communicate volumes

56
00:04:36,201 --> 00:04:38,562
about their personality, their mood,

57
00:04:38,562 --> 00:04:39,522
their status in the world,

58
00:04:39,522 --> 00:04:41,563
the way they interact with objects,

59
00:04:41,563 --> 00:04:42,983
the way they walk, jump,

60
00:04:42,983 --> 00:04:44,503
the way they flinch when they get hurt.

61
00:04:44,503 --> 00:04:47,624
These are all means by which to communicate

62
00:04:47,624 --> 00:04:50,265
to the viewer information that might take paragraphs

63
00:04:50,265 --> 00:04:51,425
to describe otherwise.

64
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,423
If a picture is worth a thousand words,

65
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:58,186
then a sequence of images is like,

66
00:04:58,186 --> 00:05:00,909
it's gotta be like an essay or something, I don't know.

67
00:05:00,909 --> 00:05:03,872
But honestly, that communication aspect

68
00:05:03,872 --> 00:05:05,193
is true for most animation,

69
00:05:05,193 --> 00:05:06,555
whether it's for games or not,

70
00:05:06,555 --> 00:05:09,317
communicating personality and individuality

71
00:05:09,317 --> 00:05:10,479
through the motion.

72
00:05:12,195 --> 00:05:17,736
But animating for games has an additional concern, which is communicating the game's state.

73
00:05:17,736 --> 00:05:21,417
Not only must you convey the nature of the world and the characters in a broad sense,

74
00:05:21,417 --> 00:05:25,897
you also have to present a clear message of what's happening right now and why,

75
00:05:25,897 --> 00:05:30,938
and how the current game state will flow into the next and how its logical conclusion

76
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:32,679
of whatever the previous state was.

77
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:37,240
And you have to fit all of those matters of character and personality into that context.

78
00:05:38,287 --> 00:05:45,191
You probably won't have a full solid 60 seconds of animation to convey that our reluctant hero

79
00:05:45,191 --> 00:05:50,075
is feeling uncertain of their ability and in over their head. You might only have 8 frames

80
00:05:50,075 --> 00:05:55,478
of a run cycle, 6 frames of an attack animation, and a single hurt frame to get across those ideas.

81
00:05:57,342 --> 00:05:59,904
Moreover, that attack animation also needs to convey,

82
00:05:59,904 --> 00:06:02,005
here's where the hitbox is.

83
00:06:02,005 --> 00:06:04,167
These are invulnerability frames.

84
00:06:04,167 --> 00:06:05,968
This is the cooldown time.

85
00:06:05,968 --> 00:06:09,851
It can be a lot to keep in mind in addition to the meta objective

86
00:06:09,851 --> 00:06:11,312
of make thing look good.

87
00:06:11,312 --> 00:06:14,835
But this communication aspect of animation is one that I see frequently

88
00:06:14,835 --> 00:06:19,419
misunderstood or outright ignored by animators who are just starting out

89
00:06:19,419 --> 00:06:22,021
and the non-artists who are making requests of us.

90
00:06:22,641 --> 00:06:25,064
What is the actual relevant information here?

91
00:06:25,064 --> 00:06:27,367
What is the game state that you're trying to get across?

92
00:06:27,367 --> 00:06:30,731
What is the character that you're trying to impart?

93
00:06:30,731 --> 00:06:33,455
Good animation is effective communication.

94
00:06:33,455 --> 00:06:36,378
It doesn't matter how cool that backflip looks

95
00:06:36,378 --> 00:06:38,421
if it also takes away the player's ability

96
00:06:38,421 --> 00:06:40,763
to accurately read the situation.

97
00:06:44,717 --> 00:06:50,681
Another thing to think about is the fact that motion can be kind of an aesthetic in and of itself.

98
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:55,765
Like, of course, the way things move enhances whatever visual style is already present,

99
00:06:55,765 --> 00:07:03,731
but it is possible to have an art style that looks great in stills, but if it's animated poorly, it can really kill the whole vibe.

100
00:07:03,731 --> 00:07:08,314
It's also possible to have a visual style that looks very simple and unassuming at a glance,

101
00:07:08,314 --> 00:07:12,357
but that moves with a clarity and precision that elevates it.

102
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:19,147
This is specifically not to say that you should go ahead and base your visual style and just absolute trash

103
00:07:19,147 --> 00:07:23,751
Just because it could in theory look cool in motion. Although I mean feel free but

104
00:07:24,619 --> 00:07:27,260
remember all the stuff I said about keeping in mind the limitations of the

105
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:30,001
medium, if you do pursue that. Rather,

106
00:07:30,001 --> 00:07:35,903
what I mean is that animation is an important pivot of aesthetic.

107
00:07:35,903 --> 00:07:40,364
It's an important pivot point within aesthetic that can elevate or diminish

108
00:07:40,364 --> 00:07:44,905
other stylistic design decisions without being too reliant on them.

109
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:52,440
Honestly, this fact is kind of one of my favorite things about animation in general, the fact

110
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,725
that I can look at, for example, a child's drawing and envision a reality in which for

111
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:03,491
all the naivete and lack of finesse of the still image, I can envision a reality in which

112
00:08:03,491 --> 00:08:09,617
it's animated in a way that lends credibility and intentionality and makes it look good

113
00:08:09,617 --> 00:08:11,359
and cool when it moves.

114
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:17,164
I can look at this image and imagine the ways that I might animate it in a way that makes

115
00:08:17,164 --> 00:08:22,247
sense and has weight and feels right, but that still doesn't rely on changing the underlying

116
00:08:22,247 --> 00:08:27,271
aesthetic, whether it's worth doing or how easy it would be is another matter.

117
00:08:27,271 --> 00:08:33,474
But my point is just that good art can have the principles of animation applied poorly

118
00:08:33,474 --> 00:08:38,558
and what would traditionally be called bad art can have the principles of animation applied

119
00:08:38,558 --> 00:08:38,818
well.

120
00:08:39,792 --> 00:08:46,957
The form that the style takes does not dictate the quality of animation that is possible.

121
00:08:46,957 --> 00:08:50,579
Also, I mean, it would be pretty cool to have an animated game that looks like a

122
00:08:50,579 --> 00:08:55,022
child's drawing. Someone, somebody done that? Somebody's probably done that.

123
00:08:55,022 --> 00:09:00,146
So with those considerations in mind, let's look at some of the more

124
00:09:00,146 --> 00:09:02,848
technical details of what makes good animation.

125
00:09:03,527 --> 00:09:07,311
First off, with a few definitions that I'll use throughout this talk that you should probably

126
00:09:07,311 --> 00:09:12,537
understand, you may have heard these terms before, but in case you haven't, covering my bases.

127
00:09:12,537 --> 00:09:17,302
Keyframes. These are the frames that show the key positions of whatever it is that you're animating.

128
00:09:17,302 --> 00:09:21,026
The ones that tell the story of what's actually happening.

129
00:09:21,026 --> 00:09:25,210
Just looking at the keyframes, you should be able to tell what the action is.

130
00:09:27,997 --> 00:09:32,559
In-betweens are the frames, logically, that come in between the keyframes,

131
00:09:32,559 --> 00:09:38,283
the ones that smooth out the key poses into a cohesive, fluid motion.

132
00:09:38,283 --> 00:09:44,347
Spacing refers to how much an element moves in between one frame and the next.

133
00:09:44,347 --> 00:09:47,929
And smears and multiples are techniques to show motion

134
00:09:47,929 --> 00:09:50,470
by stretching an object across time

135
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:53,172
or making it appear multiple times within a single frame.

136
00:09:56,299 --> 00:10:00,203
And then there are the principles of animation.

137
00:10:00,203 --> 00:10:01,264
There are 12 of them.

138
00:10:01,264 --> 00:10:04,728
Some guys at Disney wrote them down back in the eighties,

139
00:10:04,728 --> 00:10:08,251
based on work that was done in the decades prior to that.

140
00:10:08,251 --> 00:10:13,977
They aren't the whole of what makes good animation because art is subjective or

141
00:10:13,977 --> 00:10:16,579
whatever, but they're an important foundation.

142
00:10:16,579 --> 00:10:18,121
If you're just getting into animation,

143
00:10:18,121 --> 00:10:19,402
these principles are

144
00:10:19,763 --> 00:10:24,389
the jumping off point for understanding motion and developing an analytical eye as you consume

145
00:10:24,389 --> 00:10:28,616
the works of others. And if you work with animators, these are concepts that may be

146
00:10:28,616 --> 00:10:33,222
handy for you to have in order to more effectively communicate your ideas to them or

147
00:10:33,222 --> 00:10:34,705
understand what they're talking about.

148
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,368
Sorry. But like I said, these principles were written by Disney dudes,

149
00:10:43,368 --> 00:10:48,558
and so some of them are a bit less relevant to games animation than they are

150
00:10:48,558 --> 00:10:51,664
for film and TV and such, and others are just kind of.

151
00:10:51,884 --> 00:10:57,285
not super relevant to the intent of this talk. For instance, staging is a matter of composition

152
00:10:57,285 --> 00:11:02,927
and scene setup, how you guide the viewer's eye, that sort of thing, which while it can still

153
00:11:02,927 --> 00:11:09,188
apply to games, might be better explored through level design or something. And solid drawing is

154
00:11:09,188 --> 00:11:15,989
also one of the 12 principles, but it basically just means be good at art, which isn't the most

155
00:11:15,989 --> 00:11:19,710
helpful advice in my mind, so we're going to ignore some of these.

156
00:11:22,027 --> 00:11:24,949
If you really want to get good at animation, though, I highly recommend

157
00:11:24,949 --> 00:11:28,011
actually going and reading about all 12 principles and whatever other resources

158
00:11:28,011 --> 00:11:29,732
you can get your grubby little hands on.

159
00:11:29,732 --> 00:11:32,594
But I'm specifically trying to cover things

160
00:11:32,594 --> 00:11:36,336
that might not be touched on in other places and things that are specific to games.

161
00:11:36,336 --> 00:11:39,318
And a lot has been written about these principles already.

162
00:11:39,318 --> 00:11:42,761
So we'll check out the seven principles of animation that

163
00:11:42,761 --> 00:11:45,222
that we care about in this context for the time being.

164
00:11:48,288 --> 00:11:53,330
So we're going to start with one you might already know about squash and stretch.

165
00:11:53,330 --> 00:11:57,052
It's when you push a rubber ball down and it gets flatter and wider.

166
00:11:57,052 --> 00:11:59,974
When you pull a rubber band and it gets longer and thinner.

167
00:11:59,974 --> 00:12:03,816
It's the quickest, easiest way to give something a sense of life.

168
00:12:03,816 --> 00:12:08,178
And you don't need to limit yourself to only affecting logically squishy things.

169
00:12:08,178 --> 00:12:11,779
The classic animation example of this is to draw a bouncing ball,

170
00:12:11,779 --> 00:12:14,821
but adding a bit of squash. Sorry.

171
00:12:19,103 --> 00:12:23,409
The classic animation example of this is to draw a bouncing ball,

172
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,596
but adding a bit of squash on just about anything is an easy way to increase the

173
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:32,202
impact of collisions or some stretch while an object is moving can impart a

174
00:12:32,202 --> 00:12:35,307
sense of speed and give it an obvious directional heading.

175
00:12:36,395 --> 00:12:38,737
Again, it's about communication.

176
00:12:38,737 --> 00:12:43,040
Squash and stretch can look good and also tell you what direction

177
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,244
an impact has come from or what direction an object is moving in and how fast.

178
00:12:48,244 --> 00:12:51,967
It's important, very important that you maintain the volume

179
00:12:51,967 --> 00:12:56,150
of the object and character mass that gets sucked in along one axis

180
00:12:56,150 --> 00:12:57,851
has to spread out on another.

181
00:12:57,851 --> 00:13:00,793
If you aren't careful about maintaining the subject's volume,

182
00:13:00,793 --> 00:13:04,296
it quickly stops reading as squash and stretch and becomes.

183
00:13:05,116 --> 00:13:10,362
a transforming thing and what was supposed to have impact might end up having less because

184
00:13:10,362 --> 00:13:17,990
it changes from a matter of perceiving force to a matter of perceiving malleability.

185
00:13:17,990 --> 00:13:24,216
So be careful with keeping, maintaining the mass of the objects that you're animating

186
00:13:24,216 --> 00:13:26,458
when you're applying squash and stretch.

187
00:13:27,703 --> 00:13:33,245
You can see here some characters, a character that I did for for Epic Mickey and another

188
00:13:33,245 --> 00:13:39,768
that I did for Cadence of Hyrule. And see how she, Impa, sort of squashes down

189
00:13:39,768 --> 00:13:44,730
before popping up into the air. And same for the Knight Dude.

190
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:46,971
Next on the list is...

191
00:13:58,216 --> 00:14:05,878
Anticipation. This is the pre-action, the moment before a thing happens that lets you know

192
00:14:05,878 --> 00:14:11,840
what's about to happen, that something is about to happen. Usually it's a motion in the opposite

193
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:16,681
direction of whatever is about to follow. A slight shift to the right before you move to the left,

194
00:14:16,681 --> 00:14:21,463
a dip down low before you leap upward. Anticipation can be big.

195
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:28,043
big sweeping windup before an enormous punch, a laser that pulls in on itself and shakes like

196
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:32,945
crazy in preparation to fire, or like a low twisting crouch where the character tenses like

197
00:14:32,945 --> 00:14:41,628
a spring before a super jump. This is another character from Epic Mickey, Razul, and you can

198
00:14:41,628 --> 00:14:46,530
see kind of a few different moments of anticipation within this.

199
00:14:47,230 --> 00:14:48,872
So first of all, there's the most obvious,

200
00:14:48,872 --> 00:14:51,494
which is the flourish that leads into the crouching position

201
00:14:51,494 --> 00:14:52,995
before charging forward.

202
00:14:52,995 --> 00:14:55,497
Like that crouching position can be considered

203
00:14:55,497 --> 00:14:57,298
like in anticipation of moving forward,

204
00:14:57,298 --> 00:14:59,220
but there are also some other ones

205
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,082
that might be a little less obvious.

206
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:04,844
There's a dip before the actual charging,

207
00:15:04,844 --> 00:15:06,025
like he's in the crouch pose

208
00:15:06,025 --> 00:15:09,108
and then he dips backwards before charging forward.

209
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:11,189
That's anticipation.

210
00:15:11,810 --> 00:15:16,074
lifting like the actual spinning of the sword and putting it in the hand that can be considered like

211
00:15:16,074 --> 00:15:20,578
an anticipation you can see it's moving in the opposite sword come in the opposite direction

212
00:15:20,578 --> 00:15:26,263
coming up before going down and being held in both hands and there's also a little hop towards

213
00:15:26,263 --> 00:15:33,569
the end of the charge that sort of prefaces the stop of movement where he like hops up before

214
00:15:33,569 --> 00:15:35,371
sliding down and crouching a little bit lower.

215
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:43,660
But notice how each moment of anticipation is largely in an opposing direction to whatever action it is that follows.

216
00:15:46,112 --> 00:15:48,834
Anticipation can also be very brief.

217
00:15:48,834 --> 00:15:52,677
If you're making an action game where reflexes matter to any degree,

218
00:15:52,677 --> 00:15:56,679
you probably don't want your player character to have to wait a half a second before their

219
00:15:56,679 --> 00:15:59,241
input comes to fruition, no matter how cool it looks.

220
00:15:59,241 --> 00:16:02,563
Unless you're making a Soulsborne or some such.

221
00:16:02,563 --> 00:16:08,307
You might have enough room to add one or two frames of windup before it starts feeling laggy.

222
00:16:08,827 --> 00:16:15,851
For many games, player actions don't even have any frames of anticipation, but they still manage to

223
00:16:15,851 --> 00:16:21,674
look good because they still manage to feel good. Remember, animation in games shouldn't

224
00:16:21,674 --> 00:16:26,717
override or betray the gameplay. It should serve it. It should bolster it.

225
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,996
So in a lot of games where you need that snap, that instant action,

226
00:16:30,996 --> 00:16:33,738
sometimes there's no wind up at all on player actions,

227
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,840
but usually you can fit like a frame or two in there.

228
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:40,982
This is Impa again from Cadence of Hyrule,

229
00:16:40,982 --> 00:16:44,705
doing a bit of wind up before, before spearing out.

230
00:16:44,705 --> 00:16:49,948
A bit of anticipation.

231
00:16:49,948 --> 00:16:50,448
Importantly.

232
00:16:51,900 --> 00:17:00,661
Anticipation not only prefaces what's about to happen, but it can also tell players how important what is about to happen is through contrast.

233
00:17:00,661 --> 00:17:06,162
Frequently, contrast is spoken in terms of color and brightness and that sort of thing.

234
00:17:06,162 --> 00:17:08,163
But there is also contrast in motion.

235
00:17:08,163 --> 00:17:19,685
If something that was moving is suddenly still or that was still is suddenly moving, you'll notice large motions draw the eye, rapid motions draw the eye.

236
00:17:19,685 --> 00:17:19,965
And so.

237
00:17:20,894 --> 00:17:24,377
You want to be absolutely sure the players can see what's about to happen.

238
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:28,319
You want to draw their eye, their attention to the important thing.

239
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,262
Don't just make the anticipation longer and give them more time to see it,

240
00:17:32,262 --> 00:17:34,744
because again, that's not always going to be an option.

241
00:17:34,744 --> 00:17:37,506
Like it has to be subservient to the gameplay.

242
00:17:37,506 --> 00:17:40,948
And that's where like all this timing and stuff comes into play.

243
00:17:40,948 --> 00:17:45,551
But. As opposed to making the anticipation last longer,

244
00:17:45,551 --> 00:17:49,814
you can make it divergent from the norm, from whatever.

245
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:55,099
From whatever the usually is, whatever the thing is that's doing the anticipation,

246
00:17:55,099 --> 00:18:01,906
that's doing the wind up, change its silhouette, change its color, make it vibrate, make it

247
00:18:01,906 --> 00:18:07,752
smaller or bigger. Tense it like a coiled snake, fill it with potential energy.

248
00:18:07,752 --> 00:18:11,776
Give the player's eye something to latch on to and it will.

249
00:18:14,607 --> 00:18:18,554
So here we have a Wizzrobe from Cadence of Hyrule.

250
00:18:18,554 --> 00:18:21,139
You can see there are a number of things going on to sort of

251
00:18:21,139 --> 00:18:25,787
give visual attention to this to this charge up before the attack.

252
00:18:26,806 --> 00:18:28,487
The silhouette changes.

253
00:18:28,487 --> 00:18:34,530
You can see that that for the normal version, he's kind of like rounded.

254
00:18:34,530 --> 00:18:38,413
But as he's charging his hat and other elements become much sharper,

255
00:18:38,413 --> 00:18:41,835
much pointier, much more aggressive feeling.

256
00:18:41,835 --> 00:18:45,837
There's also like a bit of vibration that that that kind of motion

257
00:18:45,837 --> 00:18:47,638
can can attract the player's eye.

258
00:18:47,638 --> 00:18:49,219
The silhouette changes completely.

259
00:18:49,219 --> 00:18:54,262
The scarf comes off and begins flapping as another point of interest.

260
00:18:56,285 --> 00:19:00,771
So yeah, there are a lot of different elements

261
00:19:00,771 --> 00:19:04,196
that you can tweak to provide contrast

262
00:19:04,196 --> 00:19:07,580
between one animation, one motion, and the next.

263
00:19:11,074 --> 00:19:18,579
Next on the list of principles of animation, we have timing and timing is pretty much what

264
00:19:18,579 --> 00:19:19,379
it sounds like.

265
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:21,721
It's how long things take to happen.

266
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:23,902
It's where the beats are.

267
00:19:23,902 --> 00:19:25,824
It's the cadence of things.

268
00:19:25,824 --> 00:19:30,487
If an animation is a sentence that describes an action, then timing can be thought of as

269
00:19:30,487 --> 00:19:32,568
sort of where the punctuation is.

270
00:19:32,568 --> 00:19:38,472
This can be very important in game art because game elements, especially characters...

271
00:19:43,043 --> 00:19:46,984
Sorry. This can be very important in game art because game elements,

272
00:19:46,984 --> 00:19:47,824
especially characters,

273
00:19:47,824 --> 00:19:53,646
tend to have fairly discrete states and how animations are paced is frequently

274
00:19:53,646 --> 00:19:57,928
tied directly to the transition between and within these states.

275
00:19:57,928 --> 00:20:01,829
Timing informs how readily these state changes will be parsed by the player in

276
00:20:01,829 --> 00:20:04,790
active, moving, changing, and visual environment.

277
00:20:05,885 --> 00:20:09,669
And timing is also an essential part of conveying character.

278
00:20:09,669 --> 00:20:13,252
To continue the metaphor, if timing is the punctuation,

279
00:20:13,252 --> 00:20:15,815
then it stands to reason that different characters

280
00:20:15,815 --> 00:20:18,257
would have different cadences to their speech.

281
00:20:18,257 --> 00:20:21,460
They have different dialects, different patterns,

282
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:24,283
and so too will they have different cadences

283
00:20:24,283 --> 00:20:25,124
in their motion.

284
00:20:27,631 --> 00:20:32,496
So you can see here two different characters that have the exact same

285
00:20:32,496 --> 00:20:36,339
frames, nothing about the actual frames themselves has changed except the

286
00:20:36,339 --> 00:20:39,062
timing. You can see on the left,

287
00:20:39,062 --> 00:20:41,905
the characters tend to have like a more steady

288
00:20:42,805 --> 00:20:47,087
pace and the ones on the right have like definitive beats to their movement,

289
00:20:47,087 --> 00:20:51,388
the big demon night guy like steps and pauses after each step.

290
00:20:51,388 --> 00:20:55,329
It makes it feel a little more weighty while the one on the, on the,

291
00:20:55,329 --> 00:20:57,069
on the left is,

292
00:20:57,069 --> 00:21:02,331
is a bit more constant and kind of lacks a bit of a,

293
00:21:02,331 --> 00:21:05,392
lacks a bit of focus on any particular pose or moment.

294
00:21:05,392 --> 00:21:10,753
Same goes for the high knocks again from Cadence of Hyrule where the one on the

295
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:19,719
on the right, like, very definitively has a few poses that he holds that hold

296
00:21:19,719 --> 00:21:26,100
focus. And there's more weight and more character to these motions, as opposed to

297
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:31,302
just like spinning around and chucking the thing, spin around, hold, build that

298
00:21:31,302 --> 00:21:36,303
that that potential energy and then continue onward.

299
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:44,624
Ease in and ease out, also called slow in and slow out,

300
00:21:44,624 --> 00:21:48,267
are sort of specific applications of timing.

301
00:21:48,267 --> 00:21:52,250
Easing in and out is basically just another way

302
00:21:52,250 --> 00:21:53,591
of saying that objects have inertia.

303
00:21:54,031 --> 00:21:58,875
Things take a bit of time to get up to full speed or come to a complete stop.

304
00:21:58,875 --> 00:22:04,000
When you ease in, you kind of start with your frames spaced closely together

305
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:09,645
and they get further apart as the motion progresses to represent like acceleration, you know.

306
00:22:09,645 --> 00:22:11,146
Ease out is the exact opposite.

307
00:22:11,146 --> 00:22:16,431
It's something coming to a slower halt.

308
00:22:18,213 --> 00:22:22,296
It's this easing in the easing is essentially a measure of how spacing

309
00:22:22,296 --> 00:22:24,758
changes across time.

310
00:22:24,758 --> 00:22:31,184
It's worth noting that sometimes these elements that that easing is trying to

311
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:36,028
represent are handled by actual game

312
00:22:36,028 --> 00:22:39,491
logic, you know, things like inertia, acceleration, deceleration.

313
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:43,995
Sometimes like that doesn't need to be coded into the.

314
00:22:44,919 --> 00:22:46,560
the animation itself that you're working with,

315
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,881
because that's like the thing that the code is doing,

316
00:22:49,881 --> 00:22:52,161
is handling all the acceleration and deceleration

317
00:22:52,161 --> 00:22:54,702
and inertia for like, you know,

318
00:22:54,702 --> 00:22:58,423
entire entities for characters and that sort of thing.

319
00:22:58,423 --> 00:23:01,544
Which brings me to the point that a little bit of a break

320
00:23:01,544 --> 00:23:02,785
from the 12 principles,

321
00:23:02,785 --> 00:23:06,726
these animation principles were written

322
00:23:06,726 --> 00:23:08,926
while operating under the assumption

323
00:23:08,926 --> 00:23:11,327
that the animator would have complete control over

324
00:23:12,198 --> 00:23:15,741
all elements of the scene, essentially, that there wouldn't be any outside variables

325
00:23:15,741 --> 00:23:19,625
actively changing what's happening on screen as it occurs.

326
00:23:19,625 --> 00:23:22,448
Obviously, that's not the case with games,

327
00:23:22,448 --> 00:23:26,692
which isn't to say that these principles aren't still incredibly useful,

328
00:23:26,692 --> 00:23:30,736
but rather that it's important to understand

329
00:23:30,736 --> 00:23:33,579
when and where they apply in the context of of.

330
00:23:34,252 --> 00:23:40,857
games and alongside game logic and consider where the game logic might be

331
00:23:40,857 --> 00:23:45,980
interacting with these principles of acceleration, deceleration, anticipation,

332
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:47,722
all that sort of thing.

333
00:23:47,722 --> 00:23:54,686
Not just not just in the way that I mentioned earlier, where anticipation on

334
00:23:54,686 --> 00:23:59,350
player characters can be short to avoid visual lag and sluggish input like

335
00:23:59,350 --> 00:24:00,570
that's that's one example.

336
00:24:00,570 --> 00:24:03,192
But also in the sense of like.

337
00:24:04,855 --> 00:24:09,818
you need to know like what exactly the character is doing in the game when

338
00:24:09,818 --> 00:24:13,100
you're animating for it. You know, like, like if, if your character,

339
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:17,542
if you're animating an attack animation that can be played while the character

340
00:24:17,542 --> 00:24:19,143
is either still or moving,

341
00:24:19,143 --> 00:24:22,224
that's something that you need to know and take into account because if you

342
00:24:22,224 --> 00:24:24,305
animated as, as if they're standing still,

343
00:24:24,305 --> 00:24:26,786
there'll be like sliding around whenever you attack.

344
00:24:26,786 --> 00:24:28,487
And if you animate it as if they're only moving,

345
00:24:28,487 --> 00:24:29,468
they might look like they have

346
00:24:30,292 --> 00:24:34,716
more motion than is reasonable for for attacking standing still.

347
00:24:34,716 --> 00:24:37,738
So and. I've

348
00:24:37,738 --> 00:24:45,384
I've definitely had this happen before, where I've animated something

349
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:48,006
that I was pretty pleased with and ended up being a little.

350
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:57,865
displeased because it didn't look great in context because the game logic applied motion that I was

351
00:24:57,865 --> 00:25:03,890
not expecting to. And it was something that I could have accounted for had I known that that

352
00:25:03,890 --> 00:25:10,335
would have been the case. Anyway, let's get back to the principles. That was just a brief aside.

353
00:25:10,335 --> 00:25:18,060
The next principle is that of arcs. The idea is things tend to move in arcs, just

354
00:25:18,544 --> 00:25:24,972
as a general observation. Objects like to be in rotation around a focal point and if they aren't

355
00:25:24,972 --> 00:25:31,461
then they're usually being acted upon by by some kind of force that that pulls them in a direction

356
00:25:31,461 --> 00:25:35,085
or one direction or another either by gravity or because of a literal.

357
00:25:35,498 --> 00:25:41,963
physical attachment limiting directly linear motion, like a shoulder, how, you know, your

358
00:25:41,963 --> 00:25:47,287
shoulder limits the motion of your elbow, which limits the motion of your hand. These

359
00:25:47,287 --> 00:25:52,911
are all things that move along arcs, they're moving at fixed distances between one another.

360
00:25:52,911 --> 00:25:55,332
And uh,

361
00:25:56,899 --> 00:26:00,360
The pivot points for these arcs can be themselves moving along arcs.

362
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:06,241
I mean, if you think of it, humans were basically just a collection

363
00:26:06,241 --> 00:26:08,001
of pendulums strung together.

364
00:26:08,001 --> 00:26:10,262
So it can help if you're working on an animation

365
00:26:10,262 --> 00:26:14,683
and it isn't looking quite right to check the arcs

366
00:26:14,683 --> 00:26:17,183
and make sure they're moving along an expected trajectory

367
00:26:17,183 --> 00:26:21,084
without any strange jumps or sudden deviations, jitters

368
00:26:21,084 --> 00:26:24,045
that make the timing or spacing uneven, that sort of thing.

369
00:26:27,807 --> 00:26:31,711
Next, we have follow-through and overlapping action.

370
00:26:31,711 --> 00:26:32,853
Follow-through is...

371
00:26:33,577 --> 00:26:37,058
sort of at the opposite end of anticipation.

372
00:26:37,058 --> 00:26:40,079
If anticipation is communicating what's about to happen,

373
00:26:40,079 --> 00:26:43,061
then follow through is communicating what has just happened

374
00:26:43,061 --> 00:26:44,761
and how it continues to impact the subject.

375
00:26:44,761 --> 00:26:49,643
Follow through is the way your arm continues for a bit before settling,

376
00:26:49,643 --> 00:26:50,664
after throwing a ball,

377
00:26:50,664 --> 00:26:54,305
or the way a long coat comes to rest a bit later than the rest of you

378
00:26:54,305 --> 00:26:55,266
when you stop running.

379
00:26:55,266 --> 00:26:59,167
Nothing ever really stops stone cold when it's finished moving,

380
00:26:59,167 --> 00:27:00,728
and follow through is a reflection of that.

381
00:27:00,908 --> 00:27:05,391
Similarly, overlapping action is the notion that different elements move at different

382
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:08,473
rates as some parts lead and other parts follow.

383
00:27:08,473 --> 00:27:16,359
This is just an animation I made a few years ago just for fun, not for any particular game,

384
00:27:16,359 --> 00:27:20,542
but you can see that it has a lot of elements of follow through in it.

385
00:27:20,542 --> 00:27:26,946
The sleeve, the sleeves kind of dragging behind, the lantern swinging, coming back to the notion

386
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,048
of arcs, the lantern swinging in an arc.

387
00:27:30,598 --> 00:27:37,701
The shorts also kind of lagging behind the legs,

388
00:27:37,701 --> 00:27:41,022
the flames being kicked up in front of the boots.

389
00:27:41,022 --> 00:27:44,024
These are all sort of elements of follow through

390
00:27:44,024 --> 00:27:46,685
and overlapping action.

391
00:27:49,040 --> 00:27:52,703
I want to say something about how follow through and overlapping action are important in games

392
00:27:52,703 --> 00:27:58,848
specifically because XYZ, the delayed elements, can help clarify information, etc.

393
00:27:58,848 --> 00:28:03,251
And I do think that's true, but more often than not, it just communicates that something

394
00:28:03,251 --> 00:28:05,693
has happened and it's finished now.

395
00:28:05,693 --> 00:28:11,218
Follow through can be subtler than other moments of motion as it kind of tends to be a state

396
00:28:11,218 --> 00:28:16,542
of energy being lost and things coming to settle or returning to a more neutral state.

397
00:28:16,542 --> 00:28:16,763
But...

398
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:20,851
follow through, it tends to ground motions

399
00:28:20,851 --> 00:28:25,933
and make them look more believable and weighty.

400
00:28:25,933 --> 00:28:28,694
Just classic tool to make thing look good.

401
00:28:28,694 --> 00:28:31,115
And you can see Makoto here.

402
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:33,776
I did not make this one.

403
00:28:33,776 --> 00:28:35,197
But you can see her,

404
00:28:35,197 --> 00:28:37,938
similarly a lot of the cloth,

405
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:43,700
like sweeping behind, following the motions before,

406
00:28:43,700 --> 00:28:45,300
kind of leading the eye.

407
00:28:46,060 --> 00:28:48,086
to an understanding of what has just occurred.

408
00:28:52,801 --> 00:28:57,242
Um, overlapping action can also help communicate patterns of motion similarly to how

409
00:28:57,242 --> 00:29:02,843
stretching a character along the axis of its motion. So squash and stretch can inform as to

410
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:11,565
its heading and speed. So too can a lagging scarf or tail or something, uh, inform to player as to

411
00:29:11,565 --> 00:29:15,987
what direction something is moving, clarify what's about to happen by showing what has.

412
00:29:16,547 --> 00:29:18,469
come to pass immediately.

413
00:29:18,469 --> 00:29:25,676
Especially in high-speed games and environments, having some kind of visual anchor to demonstrate the recent past

414
00:29:25,676 --> 00:29:32,363
can be the difference between parsing a situation and becoming lost in a rapidly changing visual landscape.

415
00:29:34,921 --> 00:29:39,185
And lastly, we have exaggeration. It's not literally lastly,

416
00:29:39,185 --> 00:29:42,128
there's still like five more principles, but like I said before,

417
00:29:42,128 --> 00:29:43,289
we don't care about those.

418
00:29:43,289 --> 00:29:47,073
So lastly of the ones we're going through is exaggeration.

419
00:29:47,073 --> 00:29:49,155
This one might seem

420
00:29:49,636 --> 00:29:55,160
Like a bit of an odd one out, a lot of the other principles focus on aspects of animation that are grounded in a more

421
00:29:55,160 --> 00:30:02,086
physical understanding of the world as viewing physics from the perspective of an artist. The gravity,

422
00:30:02,086 --> 00:30:09,272
centrifugal force implied by arcs, the inertia conveyed by follow-through and overlapping action, the

423
00:30:09,272 --> 00:30:11,774
potential energy generated through anticipation.

424
00:30:12,842 --> 00:30:17,266
But exaggeration is no less important than any of these exaggeration of both

425
00:30:17,266 --> 00:30:22,030
form and motion can triple the size of a fist mid punch

426
00:30:22,030 --> 00:30:25,193
just for that extra impact, just for even just a frame.

427
00:30:25,193 --> 00:30:28,576
You might not see it, but you can feel it

428
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:34,622
break someone's spine beyond logic to get the get them to twist

429
00:30:34,622 --> 00:30:39,646
the way you need to for that extra like wind up that extra anticipation.

430
00:30:40,127 --> 00:30:45,369
You can have the hero do a full front flip if their attack misses because their momentum

431
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:49,210
just carries them into it and they go head over head over heels.

432
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:54,432
Anticipation is frequently exaggerated just by its very nature because if it weren't it would be

433
00:30:54,432 --> 00:30:58,574
easily missed. People just don't move that way.

434
00:30:58,574 --> 00:31:02,155
Like if I'm about to do something I'm not gonna have a big motion.

435
00:31:02,926 --> 00:31:05,447
you know, to show you that I'm about to do something.

436
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:09,548
And this is kind of the advantage of the medium, that we can freely deform

437
00:31:09,548 --> 00:31:13,370
and make ridiculous all the things we need to as readily as anything else

438
00:31:13,370 --> 00:31:14,690
in order to get our point across.

439
00:31:14,690 --> 00:31:18,011
If the other principles of animation are the groundwork laid

440
00:31:18,011 --> 00:31:22,433
to keep things believable and grounded, then exaggeration is the means

441
00:31:22,433 --> 00:31:25,674
by which that believability is made to matter.

442
00:31:25,874 --> 00:31:32,476
Exaggeration can be thought of as almost a modifier that can be added to the other principles to enhance their impact.

443
00:31:32,476 --> 00:31:40,038
Exaggerate the squash and the stretch. Really push that anticipation. Fling those arcs like yo-yos.

444
00:31:40,038 --> 00:31:46,720
I've been pushing this idea of animation as communication, which might make it sound kind of utilitarian and technical, but...

445
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:52,384
That's not what I'm saying. If animators are communicators, then our communication is poetry.

446
00:31:52,384 --> 00:31:57,928
We are afforded the ability to play with form and time as much as a poet might play with rhyme and

447
00:31:57,928 --> 00:32:05,194
meter. Now, now we're going to talk about some common mistakes that people make when animating,

448
00:32:05,194 --> 00:32:10,057
not just in general. Firstly, and importantly,

449
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,722
More frames is not equivalent to better animation.

450
00:32:14,722 --> 00:32:18,283
Buttery smooth motion is not a requisite for good animation.

451
00:32:18,283 --> 00:32:21,544
And in fact, adding more frames to smooth things out

452
00:32:21,544 --> 00:32:25,106
can sometimes actively harm the idea you're trying to convey

453
00:32:25,106 --> 00:32:27,667
by making things seem a little sluggish

454
00:32:27,667 --> 00:32:30,528
in addition to creating more work for yourself.

455
00:32:30,528 --> 00:32:32,869
I sometimes see people who are new to animation

456
00:32:32,869 --> 00:32:36,650
trying to smooth over errors of timing and readability

457
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:39,271
by adding more in-between frames

458
00:32:39,271 --> 00:32:40,431
in the hope, I guess, that it'll...

459
00:32:41,244 --> 00:32:47,913
click together at some point once the motion is completely fluid. It's not really how it works.

460
00:32:47,913 --> 00:32:53,600
Even worse is the notion that adding more frames is an inherent improvement,

461
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:57,465
or that a lack of frames is somehow a sign of poor animation.

462
00:32:57,846 --> 00:33:03,891
in general. Like somehow the dream is to have all 2D animation be 60 fully rendered frames a second

463
00:33:03,891 --> 00:33:12,279
and then it would be perfect. A philosopher's stone of animation. That's also not really the goal.

464
00:33:13,039 --> 00:33:17,942
Far more important than having silky smooth frames that detail every moment of an action is having

465
00:33:17,942 --> 00:33:23,926
strong readable poses that lead logically from one to another and timing that reinforces the action.

466
00:33:23,926 --> 00:33:31,131
If you have a frame of someone with a sword raised in preparation and then immediately after a frame of them with their sword having

467
00:33:31,131 --> 00:33:37,275
slashed forward, that's still animation and if the poses are strong and the action is readable,

468
00:33:37,960 --> 00:33:47,086
it'll be better than poorly made keyframes that are tied together with 100 in-betweens.

469
00:33:48,254 --> 00:33:53,199
No amount of in-betweens is going to fix poorly timed, poorly posed keys.

470
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:55,841
Say what you will about the animation of the CDI Zelda games,

471
00:33:55,841 --> 00:34:00,006
but their issue is not that they don't have enough frames.

472
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:03,229
More often than wanting to add more frames to animations I make,

473
00:34:03,229 --> 00:34:07,634
I find myself having overdone it and I need to delete some to add back

474
00:34:07,634 --> 00:34:10,937
in some snap to the animation, make the motion feel cleaner.

475
00:34:13,190 --> 00:34:18,474
One of the first professional gigs I ever had was for a game called Amour, the Unicorn Keep.

476
00:34:18,474 --> 00:34:22,257
Yet another game with a colon and a subtitle for some reason.

477
00:34:22,257 --> 00:34:23,678
It's been there since the beginning.

478
00:34:23,678 --> 00:34:27,040
And it was a small mobile game. I was the only artist.

479
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:33,344
It was a good early job though, because all the animations in the game were like two to four frames.

480
00:34:33,344 --> 00:34:38,368
This is, by the way, not a measure of my current skill. I'm much better.

481
00:34:39,405 --> 00:34:44,107
Now I can do much better under the same constraints.

482
00:34:44,107 --> 00:34:48,009
But it was a great early exercise in readability of motion

483
00:34:48,009 --> 00:34:52,971
under very strict frame limits. And to this day, I don't really think any of these,

484
00:34:52,971 --> 00:34:56,852
any of these animations need to have more frames than they, than they do.

485
00:34:56,852 --> 00:34:59,894
Other than, other than maybe the bow.

486
00:34:59,894 --> 00:35:02,275
I think the bow could probably use some follow through,

487
00:35:02,275 --> 00:35:05,116
but everything else is two frames, four frames. It reads.

488
00:35:05,116 --> 00:35:07,757
You don't need any more than that.

489
00:35:09,488 --> 00:35:14,934
So, if we're not going to add more frames to smooth out the motion, how do we ensure

490
00:35:14,934 --> 00:35:21,881
that motion reads as smoothly and continuously as we want, especially for fast moving objects

491
00:35:21,881 --> 00:35:22,722
and things?

492
00:35:22,722 --> 00:35:27,027
Oh, that brings us to our next common mistake or misconception.

493
00:35:27,027 --> 00:35:31,332
Smears and multiples.

494
00:35:31,607 --> 00:35:37,391
As mentioned briefly before, smears and multiples are techniques used to show the motion of an

495
00:35:37,391 --> 00:35:44,657
object across time by distorting it, and they are my favorite thing. I love them so much.

496
00:35:44,657 --> 00:35:47,419
I want to use them everywhere. They are so fun to draw.

497
00:35:47,419 --> 00:35:53,643
This is another animation I did for Epic Mickey, and it is my favorite frame that I have ever made.

498
00:35:53,643 --> 00:35:57,927
Somebody pay me to make a game that is nothing but smears, please. I will do it in a heartbeat.

499
00:36:00,797 --> 00:36:07,384
But I think smears are often sadly misunderstood.

500
00:36:07,384 --> 00:36:11,949
Your first inclination upon seeing these smears and multiples might be that they

501
00:36:11,949 --> 00:36:13,270
represent speed,

502
00:36:13,270 --> 00:36:17,174
that they're used as a means to communicate this thing is moving quickly.

503
00:36:17,174 --> 00:36:20,978
But that's not entirely true. Smears and multiples,

504
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:23,841
despite how strange and abstract they often end up looking,

505
00:36:24,878 --> 00:36:26,399
are tools to clarify.

506
00:36:26,399 --> 00:36:30,664
They are the result of an object moving so quickly

507
00:36:30,664 --> 00:36:34,908
that a frame needs to contain additional information

508
00:36:34,908 --> 00:36:38,632
in order to properly connect the previous with the next.

509
00:36:38,632 --> 00:36:42,556
Smears aren't used to convey speed, but rather they are the result of speed.

510
00:36:42,556 --> 00:36:46,079
And this is something that I think a lot of new animators

511
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,320
don't really understand, because I see.

512
00:36:48,597 --> 00:36:53,460
A lot of times I see smears and multiples and just blur, motion blur,

513
00:36:53,460 --> 00:36:55,901
being used in the exact opposite way.

514
00:36:55,901 --> 00:37:00,284
An object that is moving slowly enough to be easily read

515
00:37:00,284 --> 00:37:06,507
is given a streak behind it that because, well, that's what fast things have.

516
00:37:06,507 --> 00:37:10,370
And so if I add what fast thing has

517
00:37:10,370 --> 00:37:13,231
to my slow thing,

518
00:37:13,231 --> 00:37:16,393
I'll make it seem fast. That's.

519
00:37:17,342 --> 00:37:19,324
not really, it doesn't follow.

520
00:37:19,324 --> 00:37:20,124
The logic doesn't work.

521
00:37:20,124 --> 00:37:22,246
Because remember, it's about

522
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:25,008
communication and clarity of events,

523
00:37:25,008 --> 00:37:27,009
readability of motion.

524
00:37:27,009 --> 00:37:29,051
You don't add a smear to indicate

525
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:30,292
speed. You add a smear to

526
00:37:30,292 --> 00:37:32,874
address the loss of information

527
00:37:32,874 --> 00:37:34,355
when something is moving too quickly

528
00:37:34,355 --> 00:37:36,096
to follow otherwise.

529
00:37:36,096 --> 00:37:38,118
And also because they're hilarious

530
00:37:38,118 --> 00:37:39,859
to look at and fun to make.

531
00:37:39,859 --> 00:37:41,040
So you can see here

532
00:37:42,473 --> 00:37:47,535
the actual context of that smear from the previous slide.

533
00:37:47,535 --> 00:37:50,517
Pete is hammering his fist down,

534
00:37:50,517 --> 00:37:52,417
but you can see the middle one,

535
00:37:52,417 --> 00:37:54,138
that's what it looks like without the smear,

536
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:57,239
that's the frame in between.

537
00:37:57,239 --> 00:38:01,661
And you can see that the smear is very directly connecting

538
00:38:01,661 --> 00:38:05,963
those two very distant points of motion,

539
00:38:05,963 --> 00:38:07,323
trying to fill in that

540
00:38:07,583 --> 00:38:13,834
that lack of information, that void that would otherwise be just lost.

541
00:38:13,834 --> 00:38:20,706
Another thing to be careful of is over-animating.

542
00:38:21,613 --> 00:38:26,255
having too much animation in a way that goes beyond communicating the action and instead

543
00:38:26,255 --> 00:38:33,399
begins to obfuscate what happens or contributes to visual noise. And this isn't just a thing that

544
00:38:33,399 --> 00:38:38,002
beginners do. I've actually mostly seen this from people who are relatively decent animators,

545
00:38:38,002 --> 00:38:43,765
but maybe get carried away with making a thing move in a fun animated way while

546
00:38:43,765 --> 00:38:45,606
losing sight of the context.

547
00:38:46,007 --> 00:38:51,633
I'm not ragging on anyone specific, it's a trap I fall into on occasion as well.

548
00:38:51,633 --> 00:38:58,380
An animation can look cool in isolation, but when put into context, you might suddenly realize,

549
00:38:58,380 --> 00:39:02,605
wow, that animation, that idle animation has a lot going on and it's

550
00:39:02,605 --> 00:39:06,009
kind of exhausting to look at for hours at a time.

551
00:39:07,215 --> 00:39:09,978
Or you might make assets that look fine on their own,

552
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:13,341
but when put in context of being on screen all at once,

553
00:39:13,341 --> 00:39:15,463
suddenly begin to fight for your attention

554
00:39:15,463 --> 00:39:19,968
because they're all moving and drawing your eye.

555
00:39:19,968 --> 00:39:22,070
Remember contrast.

556
00:39:22,070 --> 00:39:24,392
Remember how it applies to motion as well.

557
00:39:24,392 --> 00:39:27,675
If your idle animation has as much motion in it

558
00:39:27,675 --> 00:39:30,418
as your run, as your jump, as your attack,

559
00:39:30,418 --> 00:39:30,698
then

560
00:39:31,773 --> 00:39:35,476
The contrast between these different states is diminished,

561
00:39:35,476 --> 00:39:39,699
and when an important state change occurs, it can be harder to distinguish

562
00:39:39,699 --> 00:39:43,641
if they all have like the same amount of motion going on.

563
00:39:43,641 --> 00:39:48,305
You want to have breaks somewhere so that your eye can

564
00:39:48,305 --> 00:39:53,489
have a bit of a rest and assess what's going on.

565
00:39:53,489 --> 00:39:59,993
The next thing to be careful of is thinking you know things.

566
00:40:01,313 --> 00:40:03,335
You don't know things. I don't know things.

567
00:40:03,335 --> 00:40:05,256
There's a lot of things I don't know.

568
00:40:05,256 --> 00:40:09,199
And that's fine because things exist and we can look at them.

569
00:40:09,199 --> 00:40:12,602
I'm saying use references, uh, even for things you think you understand,

570
00:40:12,602 --> 00:40:20,147
use references, browse the internet. I hear there's all kinds of videos on there.

571
00:40:20,147 --> 00:40:23,090
Uh, you have a body, I assume, uh,

572
00:40:23,090 --> 00:40:26,072
probably a phone with a camera, film yourself.

573
00:40:26,646 --> 00:40:34,670
Act it out, use props, take note, not just of the motion, but of the sensation of

574
00:40:34,670 --> 00:40:40,474
moving. Where do your muscles tense and stretch? What is uncomfortable to do?

575
00:40:40,474 --> 00:40:43,055
What position is comfortable to do?

576
00:40:43,055 --> 00:40:47,798
Is there a more natural feeling way of doing whatever you're trying to do that

577
00:40:47,798 --> 00:40:52,100
this character could be moving that you hadn't considered?

578
00:40:52,100 --> 00:40:55,562
You won't know these things all the time.

579
00:40:57,062 --> 00:41:01,343
And that's fine, because it's nice to have an excuse to act

580
00:41:01,343 --> 00:41:04,044
like an absolute fool in a professional capacity. I've been

581
00:41:04,044 --> 00:41:09,646
paid to swing a plastic sword around in my bedroom. It was

582
00:41:09,646 --> 00:41:14,527
research. My plastic sword broke last year. I'm still sad about

583
00:41:14,527 --> 00:41:17,728
that I need to get another one. It was an incredibly handy prop

584
00:41:17,728 --> 00:41:23,090
I recommend. I recommend animators to have props, plastic

585
00:41:23,090 --> 00:41:26,871
sword, real sword, maybe, maybe, maybe a little dangerous.

586
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:35,355
But really, use references not only because you'll have a better idea of what you're working

587
00:41:35,355 --> 00:41:39,538
on in the moment, the thing that you're actually referencing, but you'll be building a mental

588
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:44,802
library to pull from, which will be even more helpful on the next thing you animate or whenever

589
00:41:44,802 --> 00:41:50,226
you finally get to the thing that you need to animate.

590
00:41:50,566 --> 00:41:53,908
that doesn't have a direct analog that you can just look up,

591
00:41:53,908 --> 00:41:57,431
you will at least have the collective knowledge of everything,

592
00:41:57,431 --> 00:42:00,433
of all the references you've gathered, of all the things that you've seen,

593
00:42:00,433 --> 00:42:06,057
and the ability to put them together in new and interesting ways to depict

594
00:42:06,057 --> 00:42:07,858
whatever action you're trying to get across.

595
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:11,761
Lastly, don't be too precious with your work.

596
00:42:11,761 --> 00:42:17,625
I mean this generally, but I also mean this very specifically in the sense that

597
00:42:17,625 --> 00:42:18,346
I sometimes see...

598
00:42:19,493 --> 00:42:23,618
see newer animators who they seem afraid to redraw frames.

599
00:42:23,618 --> 00:42:26,781
Like I see people draw a single frame of a character

600
00:42:26,781 --> 00:42:31,245
and then instead of drawing the second frame, they take their one pose

601
00:42:31,245 --> 00:42:34,989
that they've made and are happy with and just kind of shift, shift things around

602
00:42:34,989 --> 00:42:39,333
and rotate bits here and there, maybe redraw things in piecemeal.

603
00:42:39,753 --> 00:42:44,715
And more often than not, it ends up looking like an obvious Frankenstein variant of the

604
00:42:44,715 --> 00:42:47,257
one frame that they drew that they were happy with.

605
00:42:47,257 --> 00:42:51,199
Sometimes sometimes you can do that and it will be fine.

606
00:42:51,199 --> 00:42:57,902
Sometimes shifting stuff around is a completely valid way to save time and not redraw things

607
00:42:57,902 --> 00:42:59,523
that don't need redrawing.

608
00:42:59,523 --> 00:43:00,343
But

609
00:43:03,246 --> 00:43:12,049
Being able to do that and do that well, and more importantly, being able to know when that is a thing worth doing is a skill.

610
00:43:12,049 --> 00:43:15,290
It's a skill that you develop and the sense that you have.

611
00:43:15,290 --> 00:43:23,673
But sometimes you just got to draw six to 12 wholly unique frames.

612
00:43:23,673 --> 00:43:26,054
And. And you should.

613
00:43:27,635 --> 00:43:28,955
I promise it'll be worth it.

614
00:43:28,955 --> 00:43:30,456
You'll improve so much more quickly

615
00:43:30,456 --> 00:43:35,998
if you just embrace the opportunity to make new mistakes.

616
00:43:35,998 --> 00:43:40,140
Mistakes such as not keeping an object's mass

617
00:43:40,140 --> 00:43:43,081
and proportions consistent throughout the animation.

618
00:43:43,081 --> 00:43:45,122
This is for real the last one.

619
00:43:45,122 --> 00:43:47,583
This is one of those things

620
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:50,784
where that old principle of animation that I glossed over

621
00:43:50,784 --> 00:43:53,225
is gonna kind of come back to haunt us a little bit.

622
00:43:53,225 --> 00:43:54,005
Solid drawing.

623
00:43:54,533 --> 00:43:56,914
that I mentioned and kind of dismissed earlier.

624
00:43:56,914 --> 00:43:57,935
Being good at drawing.

625
00:43:57,935 --> 00:44:02,856
The best way to keep your animations from turning to jelly

626
00:44:02,856 --> 00:44:07,178
as you work and losing the mass and proportions

627
00:44:07,178 --> 00:44:10,979
is to practice and train your eyes so that you can

628
00:44:10,979 --> 00:44:12,659
spot when errors crop up.

629
00:44:12,659 --> 00:44:16,220
Hone your eyes to falcon sharpness.

630
00:44:16,220 --> 00:44:20,342
Also, do construction and rough out your animation

631
00:44:20,342 --> 00:44:23,503
beforehand so that you can catch those errors early.

632
00:44:25,364 --> 00:44:30,947
Construction in art refers to the creation of simplified forms to help in understanding

633
00:44:30,947 --> 00:44:38,391
the shape of more complex forms and the employment of those simplified forms as a foundation

634
00:44:38,391 --> 00:44:43,814
upon which to build more complex forms. So as an example, you might draw a person's limbs

635
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,515
as a bunch of cylinders to understand proportion.

636
00:44:47,096 --> 00:44:52,002
without getting bogged in and trying to accurately capture the musculature of the arm.

637
00:44:52,002 --> 00:44:56,228
In animation, it can be similarly helpful to use simple shapes

638
00:44:56,228 --> 00:45:00,634
just to make sure you're keeping things consistently sized and spaced

639
00:45:00,634 --> 00:45:03,058
without getting too hung up on the details.

640
00:45:04,114 --> 00:45:08,956
You can see here, uh, animation of a bear boss for, uh,

641
00:45:08,956 --> 00:45:14,179
for catacomb kids, uh, the rough version and the, uh, the final version.

642
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:18,301
Uh, I didn't personally do these, but, but, uh, they're a good example of,

643
00:45:18,301 --> 00:45:23,263
of how you can just use blocked out shapes to, to, uh,

644
00:45:23,263 --> 00:45:32,067
to test the motion before you lock yourself into any kind of rendering and spot spot issues early.

645
00:45:33,286 --> 00:45:37,530
Here's an unfinished animation that I just started working on a few weeks ago.

646
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:42,915
I haven't made it much further than this yet, but it's a death animation for one of the

647
00:45:42,915 --> 00:45:44,676
boss enemies in Catacomb Kids.

648
00:45:44,676 --> 00:45:47,979
You know, the one that was just on screen previously.

649
00:45:47,979 --> 00:45:52,664
I know for a fact, like just looking at it, as I was working on it, I was like, oh, there's

650
00:45:52,664 --> 00:45:56,407
a bunch of size inconsistencies and proportion issues.

651
00:45:57,387 --> 00:46:00,769
some stretches of time with you know I haven't figured out what the arms are

652
00:46:00,769 --> 00:46:06,551
doing for the entire time yet but I'm not worried about it because the point

653
00:46:06,551 --> 00:46:09,392
of the rough is to get the motion right and the timing right and see where the

654
00:46:09,392 --> 00:46:13,294
problem areas are so that I can catch them and address them before they become

655
00:46:13,294 --> 00:46:14,054
larger issues.

656
00:46:14,932 --> 00:46:18,135
If you jump directly into animating and rendering at the same time,

657
00:46:18,135 --> 00:46:22,659
you're going to be pretty sore when you run into a big error

658
00:46:22,659 --> 00:46:27,103
in the very premise of the action that you're trying to convey.

659
00:46:27,103 --> 00:46:29,766
You're going to be reluctant to address it

660
00:46:29,766 --> 00:46:33,589
because that would mean throwing away a lot of the work you've already done.

661
00:46:33,589 --> 00:46:35,471
Ask me how I know.

662
00:46:35,471 --> 00:46:40,135
But, you know, it's like the old saying goes, measure twice, animate once.

663
00:46:42,912 --> 00:46:46,934
So there are a few other miscellaneous things I want to touch on before I call

664
00:46:46,934 --> 00:46:48,074
it a talk. Um,

665
00:46:48,074 --> 00:46:53,496
there aren't quite mistakes or principles or useful jargon or anything,

666
00:46:53,496 --> 00:46:56,317
but they're just things I've come to understand and value over time.

667
00:46:56,317 --> 00:47:00,899
That might be handy tools in your bucket of tools.

668
00:47:03,572 --> 00:47:06,194
First of all, I think I should mention 2D skeletal animation.

669
00:47:06,194 --> 00:47:08,095
I should talk about that for a bit.

670
00:47:08,095 --> 00:47:12,478
Skeletal animation is when you have a character composed of

671
00:47:12,478 --> 00:47:16,341
predetermined bones and joints that are rotated on pivots

672
00:47:16,341 --> 00:47:20,604
rather than having each frame be drawn as a completely separate

673
00:47:20,604 --> 00:47:22,125
and unique image or frame.

674
00:47:24,247 --> 00:47:28,889
It's like how 3D animation works, but, you know, one less dimension.

675
00:47:28,889 --> 00:47:32,671
And skeletal animation is great. I like it a lot.

676
00:47:32,671 --> 00:47:36,412
It's I use it in my game Catacomb Kids for all the humanoid characters

677
00:47:36,412 --> 00:47:39,794
because it's important that they be able to change their visual appearance

678
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:43,075
in accordance with their equipped armor and weapons and such.

679
00:47:43,075 --> 00:47:45,136
And I knew from the start that I wasn't going to have.

680
00:47:45,336 --> 00:47:53,104
the wherewithal or patience or longevity of life to hand animate the dozens or hundreds

681
00:47:53,104 --> 00:47:58,270
of layers of equipment that would be needed to represent all the possible combinations in the game.

682
00:48:00,222 --> 00:48:03,604
And that's really one of the great benefits of skeletal animation.

683
00:48:03,604 --> 00:48:09,990
You can reskin bones, attach things to them on fly in-engine to reflect aspects of the game that

684
00:48:09,990 --> 00:48:14,233
would be otherwise extremely difficult or time-consuming to create if you were

685
00:48:14,233 --> 00:48:18,857
doing things in a more drawing-oriented fashion. Skeletal animation is also

686
00:48:19,843 --> 00:48:24,289
kind of a requirement if you're going to be doing any kind of procedural animation,

687
00:48:24,289 --> 00:48:29,895
which is animation that is done on the fly either partially or entirely by computation rather than

688
00:48:29,895 --> 00:48:36,944
being strictly handcrafted, in order to be more reactive to the events in game and the environment.

689
00:48:37,962 --> 00:48:45,847
The skeletal animation also makes it easy to blend from one pose or animation to another

690
00:48:45,847 --> 00:48:50,750
smoothly without having jumps in the animation from going from one frame to another, changing

691
00:48:50,750 --> 00:48:51,810
pose.

692
00:48:53,527 --> 00:48:58,808
Of course, skeletal animation, 2D skeletal animation is just as subject to all the previous

693
00:48:58,808 --> 00:49:04,749
principles of animation that I mentioned as frame-by-frame animation is. And it can be harder

694
00:49:04,749 --> 00:49:09,390
to implement some of these principles in a way that feels naturalistic and good if you're not

695
00:49:09,390 --> 00:49:16,551
careful because of the way skeletal animation often relies heavily on automated interpolation

696
00:49:16,551 --> 00:49:20,552
between key poses. It kind of comes back to the idea that

697
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:26,115
more frames does not equate to more quality.

698
00:49:26,115 --> 00:49:27,176
In the same way I mentioned earlier

699
00:49:27,176 --> 00:49:30,017
that good in-betweens can't save bad keys,

700
00:49:30,017 --> 00:49:31,598
the same is true in reverse.

701
00:49:31,598 --> 00:49:34,939
Strong keys don't automatically lead to good in-betweens

702
00:49:34,939 --> 00:49:35,740
or good timing.

703
00:49:35,740 --> 00:49:40,882
So if you have good keys in a skeletal pose,

704
00:49:40,882 --> 00:49:46,185
you still have to often really finesse the timing

705
00:49:46,185 --> 00:49:49,146
in the skeletal animation to get it to work well.

706
00:49:49,146 --> 00:49:50,887
It's not a set it and forget it type thing.

707
00:49:52,026 --> 00:49:58,051
Um, also in skeletal animation can be tempting to make your key frames and just

708
00:49:58,051 --> 00:50:00,853
save your time, the effort of doing all the in-betweens.

709
00:50:00,853 --> 00:50:05,017
But that's again, it's not a set it and forget it type deal.

710
00:50:05,017 --> 00:50:09,260
That's, that's, that's an easy way to have your good art look bad.

711
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,124
It's an easy way to have your, your, uh, as I mentioned earlier, uh, good style,

712
00:50:14,124 --> 00:50:18,968
uh, strong style, uh, can still be animated poorly and does disservice to

713
00:50:18,968 --> 00:50:20,069
everyone involved.

714
00:50:20,069 --> 00:50:20,109
Uh.

715
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:26,060
Skeletal animation can also be a limiting factor to some degree and the kinds of

716
00:50:26,060 --> 00:50:31,123
actions that characters can pull off. All of those aforementioned benefits come at a cost,

717
00:50:31,123 --> 00:50:36,727
which is that if you want to make an animation that really pushes the action with lots of

718
00:50:36,727 --> 00:50:40,590
twists and flips, like whatever the heck this guy is doing, it'll probably end up being much

719
00:50:40,590 --> 00:50:45,953
harder to pull off using skeletal animation than it would be to draw out the thing that

720
00:50:45,953 --> 00:50:47,274
you want to happen frame by frame.

721
00:50:51,802 --> 00:51:02,294
And I also want to mention something that kind of irks me in particular that I see in a lot of 2D skeletal animation, which is a lot of times the hips and shoulders are neglected.

722
00:51:02,294 --> 00:51:11,806
I see a lot of skeletal animation where the hips don't sway, the shoulders don't shuffle, as though those joints are pinned in place at their respective corners of an unrotating torso.

723
00:51:12,406 --> 00:51:18,148
And these are two vitally important parts of the body for establishing the motion of the entire

724
00:51:18,148 --> 00:51:23,711
body and pose. And they're central to the importance in creating forces that drive

725
00:51:23,711 --> 00:51:29,073
human action. And I mean, I kind of get it. If you make the hips and shoulders rotate,

726
00:51:29,073 --> 00:51:33,255
then you might have to then make a variance of the torso sprite to reflect the rotation

727
00:51:33,255 --> 00:51:39,518
and swap that out mid animation. It's a little more work. But I don't know, maybe it's worth it.

728
00:51:40,055 --> 00:51:44,359
I admit I kind of have it easy in Catacomb Kids, which is where this green guy is from.

729
00:51:44,359 --> 00:51:51,004
It's Grumble from my game. I kind of have it easy because the sprites are so low resolution

730
00:51:51,004 --> 00:51:56,067
that I don't really have to worry about torso rotation. You can't really tell. It's just chunky

731
00:51:56,067 --> 00:52:02,992
pixels. So maybe I can get it away with a little easier than others. But if you're going to be

732
00:52:02,992 --> 00:52:08,516
making a game using skeletal animation, it might just be worth considering, keeping in mind.

733
00:52:10,071 --> 00:52:15,574
what would need to happen to make, you know, to make the movement a little more naturalistic

734
00:52:15,574 --> 00:52:20,776
with the swaying of hips and shoulders. And I know Maxwell from Scribblenauts is kind of a

735
00:52:20,776 --> 00:52:25,518
silly comparison because he's obviously very deliberately puppet-esque and cute and cartoony.

736
00:52:25,518 --> 00:52:31,401
It's just, this is just an example of what I'm talking about just to get the idea across. I'm

737
00:52:31,401 --> 00:52:38,585
certain Maxwell is a fine lad with upstanding character. Another thing to consider is this.

738
00:52:41,415 --> 00:52:43,316
We're making games.

739
00:52:43,316 --> 00:52:48,420
Presumably, we've got an engine that can handle certain aspects of motion and visual clarity

740
00:52:48,420 --> 00:52:49,061
for us.

741
00:52:49,061 --> 00:52:52,203
Image transformation, scaling, coloring, rotation, etc.

742
00:52:52,203 --> 00:52:57,727
So you can save yourself some work and leverage those tools where you can.

743
00:52:57,727 --> 00:53:03,091
Squash and stretch as a visual effect is relatively simple to implement in code.

744
00:53:03,722 --> 00:53:07,123
and is generally useful enough effect that you might just want to say,

745
00:53:07,123 --> 00:53:10,045
screw it, I'm going to just make a single frame for this thing

746
00:53:10,045 --> 00:53:12,006
and let the code do the rest.

747
00:53:12,006 --> 00:53:16,188
If your character has a long scarf or hair that trails behind them,

748
00:53:16,188 --> 00:53:19,010
maybe you don't need to animate it by hand.

749
00:53:19,010 --> 00:53:22,792
Maybe you can slap some physics on that element and have it flow

750
00:53:22,792 --> 00:53:25,953
and follow them in a way that both makes it more integrated

751
00:53:25,953 --> 00:53:26,974
into the rest of the game.

752
00:53:26,974 --> 00:53:30,836
It also keeps you from having to animate a scarf.

753
00:53:31,827 --> 00:53:39,831
Effects like weapon trails and particle effects can also be used and sort of offloaded to the

754
00:53:39,831 --> 00:53:48,654
engine side of things to better integrate them with the world as opposed to having

755
00:53:48,654 --> 00:53:54,017
a lot of things baked into animations. So just something to keep in mind.

756
00:53:54,017 --> 00:53:59,919
And while we're on the topic of engine stuff, I also want to request

757
00:54:00,768 --> 00:54:06,031
of the people who are making the tools and pipeline for games with traditionally animated art

758
00:54:06,031 --> 00:54:13,494
to consider supporting variable frame durations for animations. The ability to have animations

759
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:18,517
not play at a constant set speed of just one single frame rate the entire way through

760
00:54:18,517 --> 00:54:23,700
and to change the duration of specific frames mid-animation is incredibly valuable

761
00:54:23,700 --> 00:54:25,721
for creating impactful timings.

762
00:54:27,102 --> 00:54:32,167
I'm going to bring back the Hinox just so you can see what a big difference it can make.

763
00:54:32,167 --> 00:54:36,190
The one on the left is playing at a constant rate.

764
00:54:36,190 --> 00:54:38,552
You can see the smear.

765
00:54:40,137 --> 00:54:43,879
that, you know, as I mentioned earlier, you know, smears are meant to clarify,

766
00:54:43,879 --> 00:54:45,260
clarify motion.

767
00:54:45,260 --> 00:54:49,122
But in this example, you're not really supposed to notice it.

768
00:54:49,122 --> 00:54:54,445
It's it's supposed to just be like very brief, just there for an instant,

769
00:54:54,445 --> 00:54:57,987
supposed to impart a feeling rather than being

770
00:54:57,987 --> 00:55:03,070
like a detail that anybody can see.

771
00:55:05,540 --> 00:55:18,948
But the constant frame rate version, that frame has just as much time given to it and weight and importance as all the other frames of the animation.

772
00:55:18,948 --> 00:55:20,249
And, yeah, I don't like it.

773
00:55:20,249 --> 00:55:27,993
So please, please make your animators happy by letting us have variable frame rates in our animations.

774
00:55:27,993 --> 00:55:31,195
That's it. That's all I'm going to say on that.

775
00:55:32,884 --> 00:55:37,587
Apparently that's all I'm going to say on anything.

776
00:55:37,587 --> 00:55:38,667
Um, yeah, that's me.

777
00:55:38,667 --> 00:55:41,509
That's, that's been my talk about animation and stuff.

778
00:55:41,509 --> 00:55:44,290
I hope it has been helpful and useful.

779
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:47,472
Um, this is me for a bit Friday.

780
00:55:47,472 --> 00:55:51,734
Uh, if you have any questions, say what's up.

781
00:55:51,734 --> 00:55:54,195
If you're going to yell at me, don't.
