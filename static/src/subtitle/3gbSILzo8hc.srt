1
00:00:09,825 --> 00:00:10,146
OK.

2
00:00:11,807 --> 00:00:14,469
Hey, I'm Andrew Frey, and this is Remote Working at SpyFox.

3
00:00:14,829 --> 00:00:18,593
It's a case study of how SpyFox does high quality indie games

4
00:00:18,633 --> 00:00:19,653
while being fully remote.

5
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,795
And in detail, we're going to talk

6
00:00:21,835 --> 00:00:25,278
about why we've chosen to be a fully remote company, what

7
00:00:25,318 --> 00:00:27,860
kind of skills a good remote developer needs over

8
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:29,041
and above their technical skills,

9
00:00:30,943 --> 00:00:32,184
what kind of workflows and tools do we

10
00:00:32,244 --> 00:00:33,985
use at SpyFox in order to be effective and efficient.

11
00:00:35,037 --> 00:00:38,217
And perhaps most interestingly, how do we take a group of people who have never been

12
00:00:38,237 --> 00:00:41,258
in the same room together and make them into a trusted and creative team?

13
00:00:42,999 --> 00:00:43,859
Like I said, I'm Andrew Frey.

14
00:00:43,899 --> 00:00:45,199
I've been in the industry for about 10 years.

15
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,740
I've worked in big 150-person co-located teams.

16
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:51,021
I've worked in small 15-person co-located teams.

17
00:00:51,081 --> 00:00:55,022
And now for the last two years, I've been working for SpyFox from my dining.

18
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:02,811
I'm just, there we, we're back, right?

19
00:01:03,892 --> 00:01:05,092
Before we, so just some disclaimers,

20
00:01:05,152 --> 00:01:07,553
I'm not standing in front of you as the director

21
00:01:07,573 --> 00:01:09,274
of production of SpyFox or anything like that.

22
00:01:09,314 --> 00:01:11,115
We're a very small company, we're a very flat company.

23
00:01:11,535 --> 00:01:14,657
So I'm documenting this mainly because I have an interest

24
00:01:14,697 --> 00:01:17,358
in process and workflows and that kind of thing.

25
00:01:18,059 --> 00:01:19,900
Also, we're not perfect.

26
00:01:19,960 --> 00:01:21,761
I'm not saying that this is how everyone should work,

27
00:01:21,801 --> 00:01:24,242
but it's, we have had some successes

28
00:01:24,482 --> 00:01:25,403
and we've had some failures,

29
00:01:25,443 --> 00:01:27,003
so I wanted to tell you about it.

30
00:01:28,642 --> 00:01:29,903
So Spidey Fox are people who don't know.

31
00:01:30,924 --> 00:01:31,625
We've been around since 2010.

32
00:01:31,665 --> 00:01:34,107
These are some of the games that we've made.

33
00:01:34,668 --> 00:01:37,050
Alpha Bear on the bottom left is coming out very soon on mobile

34
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:38,251
and it's going to set the world on fire.

35
00:01:39,051 --> 00:01:41,213
And we are a fully distributed team.

36
00:01:41,354 --> 00:01:45,117
So there's 11 of us on three different continents

37
00:01:45,157 --> 00:01:46,298
in five different time zones.

38
00:01:47,219 --> 00:01:48,800
That's me, the yellow dot, and the UK.

39
00:01:49,881 --> 00:01:52,063
We've got four people in Seattle,

40
00:01:52,083 --> 00:01:54,445
but they don't work together by habit.

41
00:01:55,983 --> 00:01:59,791
They meet up every now and again, I have a chat, but they don't, there's no SpyFox head office they work in.

42
00:02:00,472 --> 00:02:04,941
We also have two people in San Francisco, and they've just very recently started co-working together,

43
00:02:04,981 --> 00:02:07,206
but that's kind of an experiment and we're not quite sure how that's going yet.

44
00:02:08,446 --> 00:02:14,150
What's not the kind of company that's had loads of cash in order to fly everyone and have one of those fancy company holidays every now and again?

45
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:17,332
So this is actually, this is a picture of the most spy foxes that have ever been in a room.

46
00:02:17,813 --> 00:02:22,636
There's David, one of the co-founders on the left, Alex, Ryan, Pat, Daniel, the other co-founder, and me.

47
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:24,778
And this is last year at GDC, so that's six.

48
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:28,040
There are still people in the company that I've never ever met face to face.

49
00:02:30,422 --> 00:02:31,443
Why do we choose to be remote?

50
00:02:32,027 --> 00:02:35,250
Well, instead I'm going to ask you, why should you be co-located?

51
00:02:35,870 --> 00:02:40,775
There was this blog post at richg42blogspot.co.uk which kind of went viral around the turn of

52
00:02:40,795 --> 00:02:44,658
the year where he talked about his terrible experiences working in Valve's cabal room

53
00:02:44,698 --> 00:02:46,840
and I hope no one from Valve is in the room, I'm going to piss them off.

54
00:02:47,618 --> 00:02:52,862
But he was saying that the kind of busy, noisy, distracting environment is very, very difficult

55
00:02:52,882 --> 00:02:54,643
for him to focus and be productive.

56
00:02:55,084 --> 00:02:57,606
This is a photo of Bungie, and I also hope there's no one from Bungie in the room.

57
00:02:58,366 --> 00:03:04,271
And I've worked in offices like that, large, open, barn-like spaces where there's lots

58
00:03:04,311 --> 00:03:08,194
and lots of noise and lots and lots of distraction, and I found it very difficult to work in them.

59
00:03:08,953 --> 00:03:10,374
And there's some science to back that up.

60
00:03:10,394 --> 00:03:13,016
For instance, this article says, it's

61
00:03:13,036 --> 00:03:14,817
damaging to workers' attention spans, productivity,

62
00:03:14,897 --> 00:03:17,619
creativity, and satisfaction to work in an open plan office.

63
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,941
In fact, Peopleware 30 years ago was

64
00:03:19,981 --> 00:03:21,942
talking about how open plan offices can

65
00:03:21,982 --> 00:03:24,064
be distracting to productivity of creative teams.

66
00:03:25,745 --> 00:03:27,166
And yet, we seem to see it as kind

67
00:03:27,186 --> 00:03:29,787
of the default in the industry.

68
00:03:29,807 --> 00:03:32,169
I was working at a studio who had the opportunity

69
00:03:32,189 --> 00:03:35,471
to build their own new building, and they chose

70
00:03:35,531 --> 00:03:36,712
to have an open plan office.

71
00:03:37,908 --> 00:03:40,550
I think management see it as a kind of easy way to,

72
00:03:40,690 --> 00:03:43,172
like the story is that you're facilitating communication

73
00:03:43,192 --> 00:03:45,313
because one person could overhear another person talking

74
00:03:45,353 --> 00:03:47,015
and then fill in the gaps in their knowledge.

75
00:03:47,275 --> 00:03:48,676
But I see that as kind of like a hack.

76
00:03:48,736 --> 00:03:50,657
If your workflows and tools and your processes

77
00:03:50,677 --> 00:03:52,299
aren't good enough to have that kind of communication,

78
00:03:52,819 --> 00:03:54,260
then you're really just hacking it

79
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:57,582
and you're harming productivity by using Open Plan instead.

80
00:03:58,343 --> 00:03:59,484
You can have good offices.

81
00:03:59,684 --> 00:04:01,706
So in the top right is Robot Entertainment.

82
00:04:01,766 --> 00:04:03,087
Is there anyone from Robot Entertainment here?

83
00:04:04,138 --> 00:04:06,679
No, well, they seem to have a very good office,

84
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,181
lots of square foot per developer baffles

85
00:04:10,301 --> 00:04:12,202
between areas to keep the noise down.

86
00:04:12,242 --> 00:04:13,563
And I also think I'm right in saying

87
00:04:13,583 --> 00:04:15,124
that they have offices to break out into

88
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,785
if you really want to hunker down.

89
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:19,186
Stack Exchange in the bottom left

90
00:04:19,606 --> 00:04:25,149
have gone fully all in on giving their developers

91
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:26,210
their own individual offices

92
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,771
because they believe that's such a productivity boost.

93
00:04:28,191 --> 00:04:29,652
But these things are obviously expensive.

94
00:04:29,732 --> 00:04:32,173
And if you don't want to go big, maybe you should go home.

95
00:04:33,075 --> 00:04:36,738
And there's some science that says remote workers can be 30%

96
00:04:37,158 --> 00:04:38,639
more productive, fewer sick days,

97
00:04:38,679 --> 00:04:39,620
quieter work environment.

98
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:42,401
So that's one of the main reasons that we've chosen, as

99
00:04:42,421 --> 00:04:45,083
SpyFox, to work remotely is because we want to give our

100
00:04:45,103 --> 00:04:46,884
developers really, really productive environments.

101
00:04:47,765 --> 00:04:49,906
The other big reason is because we want to have a

102
00:04:50,747 --> 00:04:52,148
certain type of developer working for us.

103
00:04:53,726 --> 00:04:55,967
really, really high quality developers who are also

104
00:04:56,267 --> 00:04:58,387
really, really interested in working on the types of games

105
00:04:58,407 --> 00:04:58,868
that we make.

106
00:04:59,368 --> 00:05:01,448
And if we restrict that to, say, only people

107
00:05:01,488 --> 00:05:03,609
who are in the Seattle area, then

108
00:05:03,629 --> 00:05:06,390
we've got this tiny, tiny little intersection to choose from.

109
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:08,290
And maybe those guys are currently in jobs,

110
00:05:08,330 --> 00:05:09,851
and they can't leave right now or something.

111
00:05:10,371 --> 00:05:11,651
Where instead, if we drop that restriction,

112
00:05:11,671 --> 00:05:13,572
instead we've got this massive, massive pool to pick from.

113
00:05:13,592 --> 00:05:15,472
So those are the two main reasons.

114
00:05:15,792 --> 00:05:16,793
There's a big buck coming up.

115
00:05:18,153 --> 00:05:18,893
It's not for everyone.

116
00:05:20,097 --> 00:05:25,379
Remote working takes a special skill set and a special personality type over and above being a good developer

117
00:05:26,439 --> 00:05:30,920
We've had many developers some developers work for us who have been very high quality developers

118
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:32,901
But haven't managed to make remote working stick

119
00:05:33,281 --> 00:05:38,142
So I'm going to talk a little bit about the type of skills that you need as a remote developer

120
00:05:38,542 --> 00:05:41,423
And the type of skills you should look for if you're hiring a remote developer

121
00:05:42,863 --> 00:05:47,825
So the biggest one the most obvious one is maybe that these guys have to be comfortable with being alone at all the time

122
00:05:48,571 --> 00:05:50,031
And that's great, that's got some flexible benefits.

123
00:05:50,071 --> 00:05:53,632
I mean, I can sit in my underpants and play Taylor Swift

124
00:05:53,692 --> 00:05:55,032
and sing along at three o'clock in the afternoon

125
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,633
and I'm not gonna bother anyone,

126
00:05:58,013 --> 00:06:00,213
at least only my partner,

127
00:06:00,354 --> 00:06:03,474
but it can be difficult for some people,

128
00:06:03,814 --> 00:06:06,335
especially if you self-identify as, say, an extrovert.

129
00:06:06,615 --> 00:06:07,755
Now, luckily, we're in the industry

130
00:06:07,795 --> 00:06:09,375
where there's not too many of those people around,

131
00:06:10,436 --> 00:06:12,896
but if you do and you need that kind of day-to-day

132
00:06:12,976 --> 00:06:15,037
personal contact in order to keep your energy levels high,

133
00:06:15,057 --> 00:06:16,617
then you might find it difficult to work remotely.

134
00:06:18,255 --> 00:06:23,078
Coworking spaces can help, but be aware that not all coworking spaces are born equal.

135
00:06:23,098 --> 00:06:29,381
The place that I work at, very occasionally, is full of business consultants and a guy

136
00:06:29,421 --> 00:06:30,762
who runs an organic t-shirt company.

137
00:06:31,102 --> 00:06:35,665
They're not the same kind of support network that a co-located game development team would

138
00:06:35,685 --> 00:06:35,765
be.

139
00:06:38,521 --> 00:06:40,703
So they also, these developers have to be autonomous.

140
00:06:40,723 --> 00:06:43,006
They have to be able to function on their own

141
00:06:43,086 --> 00:06:44,568
without this support network,

142
00:06:44,728 --> 00:06:46,350
or have some kind of other support network

143
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,511
waiting in the wings to help.

144
00:06:48,112 --> 00:06:49,233
And there's a certain class of problem

145
00:06:49,653 --> 00:06:51,115
that I know engineers come across,

146
00:06:51,135 --> 00:06:53,898
that I'm actually sure if it happens in other disciplines,

147
00:06:54,559 --> 00:06:55,960
that I call the wood for the trees problem,

148
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,482
where I've got a bug,

149
00:06:57,562 --> 00:06:59,284
and I'm looking at the code line by line.

150
00:07:00,502 --> 00:07:02,683
and it all looks like it should work,

151
00:07:02,763 --> 00:07:04,503
and I can't figure out why it's not working.

152
00:07:04,943 --> 00:07:06,664
And in those situations, I used to be able to tap

153
00:07:06,764 --> 00:07:07,865
another developer on the shoulder,

154
00:07:07,925 --> 00:07:09,906
and he'd look at my code and fix it very, very quickly,

155
00:07:10,266 --> 00:07:11,826
but I can't do that when I'm working remotely.

156
00:07:12,166 --> 00:07:13,307
Maybe everyone else is asleep.

157
00:07:13,427 --> 00:07:15,168
Maybe it's harder to do that on Skype.

158
00:07:16,378 --> 00:07:21,502
So your developers need the experience to be able to solve those problems by themselves without getting too frustrated.

159
00:07:21,763 --> 00:07:26,427
So support networks can help. Maybe your support network is online, maybe it's Reddit, maybe it's Twitter,

160
00:07:27,107 --> 00:07:30,670
maybe it's a co-working space, or maybe it's just texting a buddy or using Skype.

161
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:34,321
They also have to be autonomous because they're

162
00:07:34,341 --> 00:07:35,941
going to come across points where

163
00:07:35,961 --> 00:07:36,862
they need to make decisions.

164
00:07:37,222 --> 00:07:38,242
And it's going to be quicker for them

165
00:07:38,262 --> 00:07:40,083
to just take those decisions rather than consulting

166
00:07:40,103 --> 00:07:40,884
with the rest of the team.

167
00:07:41,644 --> 00:07:43,465
So you need to be hiring the type of people

168
00:07:43,525 --> 00:07:45,426
who you can trust to make those decisions correctly,

169
00:07:45,546 --> 00:07:48,207
or at least know that when they reach a decision they shouldn't

170
00:07:48,227 --> 00:07:49,968
be taking, then they should stop and wait.

171
00:07:52,589 --> 00:07:53,930
Your developers need to be self-aware.

172
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,491
It's much, much harder to pick up

173
00:07:56,631 --> 00:07:59,432
on professional as well as personal problems over Skype.

174
00:08:00,628 --> 00:08:01,849
If you're in the same office as someone,

175
00:08:01,869 --> 00:08:03,531
it's easy to see if they're struggling with a problem.

176
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:07,534
But you can't do that when all you see of them

177
00:08:07,794 --> 00:08:10,376
is the occasional notification popping up in your chat client.

178
00:08:10,917 --> 00:08:13,279
So they need to be self-assessing and realizing

179
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,740
when there's something they should be escalating

180
00:08:15,040 --> 00:08:16,081
and telling other people about.

181
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,783
In fact, they should not be self-conscious about sharing

182
00:08:18,823 --> 00:08:19,124
issues.

183
00:08:20,385 --> 00:08:22,466
This isn't to absolve responsibility

184
00:08:22,506 --> 00:08:24,768
for professional development from managers,

185
00:08:25,449 --> 00:08:26,890
but it's much more of a two-way street

186
00:08:26,910 --> 00:08:28,571
than you would have in a co-located studio.

187
00:08:31,003 --> 00:08:31,845
They need to be communicative.

188
00:08:32,025 --> 00:08:35,089
This is a really, really, this is such an important skill

189
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:36,110
for a remote worker.

190
00:08:37,071 --> 00:08:38,513
To know what someone's working on

191
00:08:38,674 --> 00:08:39,755
and to understand the reasoning

192
00:08:39,795 --> 00:08:40,756
behind the decisions they make,

193
00:08:41,177 --> 00:08:42,699
they need to be communicating that to you

194
00:08:42,739 --> 00:08:43,840
in whatever medium they're using.

195
00:08:44,921 --> 00:08:46,721
and they need to know when there's things

196
00:08:46,741 --> 00:08:48,302
that should be broadcasting to the whole team

197
00:08:48,802 --> 00:08:51,402
rather than just leaving it and trying to remember

198
00:08:51,422 --> 00:08:53,143
to bring it up in the stand-up next time it happens.

199
00:08:53,523 --> 00:08:54,603
If anything, you want your developers

200
00:08:54,623 --> 00:08:57,063
to be erring on the side of oversharing information.

201
00:08:57,123 --> 00:08:59,324
That's not to say posting pictures of them

202
00:08:59,484 --> 00:09:00,484
in a swimsuit on the beach,

203
00:09:00,564 --> 00:09:04,605
but they want to be telling you too much

204
00:09:04,645 --> 00:09:05,785
so you can have them dial it back

205
00:09:05,805 --> 00:09:07,946
because it's very, very hard to go the other way

206
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:09,986
and tell them to start sharing more information.

207
00:09:12,387 --> 00:09:14,128
Time zones aren't specifically a skill,

208
00:09:14,168 --> 00:09:15,409
but it's something you need to be aware of

209
00:09:15,449 --> 00:09:16,610
when you're hiring remote developers.

210
00:09:18,051 --> 00:09:19,752
If you're hiring the best anywhere in the world,

211
00:09:19,832 --> 00:09:22,794
then they could be working at any time of the day or night.

212
00:09:23,874 --> 00:09:25,736
It's best if there's some kind of overlap

213
00:09:26,196 --> 00:09:28,097
between the rest of the team and this person,

214
00:09:28,137 --> 00:09:29,418
so there's at least some time

215
00:09:29,438 --> 00:09:30,839
where they're having real-time communication.

216
00:09:31,739 --> 00:09:33,981
I try to do that, so this is roughly my time.

217
00:09:34,721 --> 00:09:36,783
I'm in the green working in GMT in the UK,

218
00:09:37,103 --> 00:09:38,764
and then most Spy Foxes tend to work

219
00:09:38,864 --> 00:09:39,985
kind of on a specific clock.

220
00:09:41,334 --> 00:09:43,235
And you can see that I leave some hours back

221
00:09:43,295 --> 00:09:45,497
to come back late in the evening when I know people

222
00:09:45,557 --> 00:09:46,517
are going to be around.

223
00:09:46,857 --> 00:09:48,538
In fact, SpyFox working hours are so erratic,

224
00:09:48,598 --> 00:09:50,880
I can sometimes have people working

225
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:53,181
when I wake up in the morning, and I can sync up again

226
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:54,222
with them at 8 o'clock in the morning.

227
00:09:55,989 --> 00:09:59,630
But when you're hiring people, be aware that this is going to obviously have an impact on private life.

228
00:10:00,391 --> 00:10:03,271
So they need to be aware when you're bringing them on that they might be the best person in the world,

229
00:10:03,291 --> 00:10:05,072
they might be really well suited to working remotely,

230
00:10:05,492 --> 00:10:09,714
but if they've got a very young family, for instance, and they can't commit to working those evening hours,

231
00:10:10,054 --> 00:10:13,375
or whatever is suitable for them, then maybe it's not the right job to go for.

232
00:10:15,636 --> 00:10:18,677
So when you take all those things together, autonomous, trusted, self-aware, communicative,

233
00:10:18,937 --> 00:10:20,417
it becomes apparent that...

234
00:10:22,006 --> 00:10:24,488
Even a possible remote developer cannot be a junior.

235
00:10:24,528 --> 00:10:26,690
This is almost a definition of a senior developer.

236
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:29,152
So you can't have what I've experienced

237
00:10:29,412 --> 00:10:30,973
in many of the co-locations I've worked on

238
00:10:31,033 --> 00:10:33,155
where you have a strata of junior developers

239
00:10:33,175 --> 00:10:35,057
and then some medium experience

240
00:10:35,077 --> 00:10:36,318
and then some very senior developers.

241
00:10:36,978 --> 00:10:38,960
You need everyone across the board to be high quality

242
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,581
because they need those skills

243
00:10:40,621 --> 00:10:42,082
and they need that experience to be able to cope.

244
00:10:49,302 --> 00:10:52,546
Let's talk about communication bandwidth.

245
00:10:52,586 --> 00:10:55,108
This problem is really the core issue

246
00:10:55,148 --> 00:10:56,690
that's going to ripple through the rest of the talk

247
00:10:57,211 --> 00:10:59,413
in that you're going to spend a lot of your time

248
00:10:59,713 --> 00:11:04,198
talking to your team via IRC or text or Skype or whatever.

249
00:11:04,819 --> 00:11:08,302
And the pure heart of the matter is that text really sucks.

250
00:11:09,452 --> 00:11:11,254
If you're working in a chat room or something,

251
00:11:11,274 --> 00:11:12,495
then you can have threading issues

252
00:11:12,555 --> 00:11:15,118
where you're not actually sure when a response

253
00:11:15,578 --> 00:11:17,680
is an answer to a question or an answer to an earlier question.

254
00:11:18,181 --> 00:11:19,682
And not only that, but you can miss out

255
00:11:19,742 --> 00:11:22,465
on really, really important audio-visual cues

256
00:11:22,485 --> 00:11:23,726
that you would get when you're face-to-face.

257
00:11:23,766 --> 00:11:25,368
For instance, what my hands are doing right now,

258
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:28,491
where I'm looking, where are the pauses in my speech?

259
00:11:28,531 --> 00:11:30,393
Not just the pauses, but what's the tone of my voice

260
00:11:30,433 --> 00:11:30,933
while I'm doing it?

261
00:11:32,637 --> 00:11:34,458
And this is illustrated by a Key and Peel sketch

262
00:11:34,518 --> 00:11:35,419
that's quite funny, where they're

263
00:11:35,439 --> 00:11:39,261
trying to communicate via text message to arrange a time

264
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:40,322
to go out in the evening.

265
00:11:41,382 --> 00:11:44,184
And Peel on the top left says, I assume we meet at the bar,

266
00:11:44,244 --> 00:11:45,025
whatever, I don't care.

267
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,025
He's trying to be casual.

268
00:11:46,045 --> 00:11:47,106
He's trying to be easygoing.

269
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:50,808
And when Key gets this text, he's like, whatever?

270
00:11:50,828 --> 00:11:52,509
How could he not care?

271
00:11:52,729 --> 00:11:54,010
He's really outraged about it.

272
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:55,631
And he reads everything in the kind

273
00:11:55,651 --> 00:11:57,152
of aggressive tone of voice.

274
00:11:57,712 --> 00:12:00,414
So it's clear that text not only

275
00:12:01,521 --> 00:12:04,742
do you miss information when you're communicating over a text,

276
00:12:04,762 --> 00:12:06,863
but you're also misinterpreting communication.

277
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:10,824
It's very easy for emotions to get quite high in text.

278
00:12:10,864 --> 00:12:12,044
It happens sometimes at SpyFox.

279
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:13,565
We'll be having a conversation,

280
00:12:13,585 --> 00:12:16,566
they'll get quite passionate quite quickly.

281
00:12:17,066 --> 00:12:20,707
And when we jump to a voice chat to try and sort it out,

282
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:22,608
things get diffused very, very, very quickly.

283
00:12:22,868 --> 00:12:24,788
So it's obviously not a real issue.

284
00:12:24,848 --> 00:12:26,529
It's just that people are misunderstanding what's going on.

285
00:12:27,907 --> 00:12:34,934
So you're going to spend a lot of time trying to phrase your communications so that they're exact, so they're not ambiguous.

286
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:39,419
So also that it's accommodating for other people because you don't want any of those misunderstandings.

287
00:12:39,739 --> 00:12:43,943
And that has kind of a weird side effect that text communication can be really formal.

288
00:12:44,184 --> 00:12:51,251
And so the SpyFox atmosphere from a day-to-day perspective is quite a formal atmosphere for what's ostensibly a very creative indie company.

289
00:12:53,416 --> 00:12:55,858
So what workflows and tools do we give our people

290
00:12:55,918 --> 00:12:56,819
to try and combat this?

291
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,562
The first thing we do is we go right back

292
00:12:59,602 --> 00:13:01,243
to the heart of the matter and look at team size.

293
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:03,185
So this is a 20-person team.

294
00:13:03,826 --> 00:13:05,748
And these are the communication vectors

295
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:08,530
that one person has to take into account for that whole team.

296
00:13:09,071 --> 00:13:11,873
And if this is a remote team, then like we've already said,

297
00:13:11,933 --> 00:13:14,095
you can have to put so much more effort into communication

298
00:13:14,456 --> 00:13:15,537
that these can be multiplied.

299
00:13:15,557 --> 00:13:16,638
It becomes much more intense.

300
00:13:16,978 --> 00:13:18,960
And it starts to dominate your day-to-day function.

301
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:22,264
So what we do is try and cut everything down.

302
00:13:22,844 --> 00:13:26,567
The type of games we want to make just so happen to be suited to working in small teams,

303
00:13:26,687 --> 00:13:29,189
so we will drop everything down to two to five people at most.

304
00:13:30,870 --> 00:13:34,132
We once had a game that went to ten people, and I don't think anyone in the company really

305
00:13:34,152 --> 00:13:34,973
enjoyed that experience.

306
00:13:37,895 --> 00:13:39,516
When you're choosing your chat clients,

307
00:13:40,772 --> 00:13:42,874
There's a list of features you should be considering

308
00:13:42,914 --> 00:13:44,154
in rough priority order now.

309
00:13:44,214 --> 00:13:46,396
From the most important is rooms.

310
00:13:46,536 --> 00:13:49,617
So we will take a bunch of people on the same project

311
00:13:49,657 --> 00:13:51,839
and we'll create a project room, sometimes more than one project

312
00:13:51,879 --> 00:13:53,019
room for different subtopics.

313
00:13:53,520 --> 00:13:54,981
And everyone will go in there, and that

314
00:13:55,001 --> 00:13:57,582
will stop the rest of the studio getting spammed with messages.

315
00:13:58,963 --> 00:14:01,044
Persistent searchable histories are important,

316
00:14:01,324 --> 00:14:03,305
because that means we can scroll back to six months ago

317
00:14:03,666 --> 00:14:07,028
and see that URL that we needed for that advertising client

318
00:14:07,088 --> 00:14:07,388
or whatever.

319
00:14:09,228 --> 00:14:11,409
Mentions are great if, for instance,

320
00:14:11,449 --> 00:14:13,289
say our art director will span multiple projects

321
00:14:13,349 --> 00:14:15,850
and you want to pull him into your room when he's needed,

322
00:14:16,211 --> 00:14:17,411
so you can mention him and pull him in.

323
00:14:19,532 --> 00:14:21,012
Guest and external accounts are fantastic

324
00:14:21,032 --> 00:14:22,293
for working with contractors.

325
00:14:23,653 --> 00:14:25,834
And finally, it's great if you can take that group of people

326
00:14:26,234 --> 00:14:28,335
and jump straight into a voice call or a video call

327
00:14:28,355 --> 00:14:29,796
with that whole room.

328
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:36,242
For most of our text document stuff, we use Google Docs.

329
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:37,523
And that's kind of self-evident.

330
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,144
I think even co-located teams are starting to use this.

331
00:14:39,624 --> 00:14:41,825
Because the comments and the history and the collaboration

332
00:14:41,845 --> 00:14:43,406
tools are so very, very, very good.

333
00:14:44,347 --> 00:14:47,168
We use a kind of blog post style design document

334
00:14:47,809 --> 00:14:51,751
where we'll have a big starting blog post in the Google Docs.

335
00:14:51,771 --> 00:14:53,172
And then further blog posts will appear

336
00:14:53,192 --> 00:14:56,053
above that documenting how the design changes over time.

337
00:14:56,073 --> 00:14:58,415
There's more details on that at this URL,

338
00:14:58,435 --> 00:14:59,275
so I won't go into it now.

339
00:15:01,733 --> 00:15:03,174
We use Trello for project management.

340
00:15:03,214 --> 00:15:05,755
We can get away with that, because, like I said,

341
00:15:05,775 --> 00:15:06,715
we're working with such more teams.

342
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:09,076
But whatever project management tool you end up using,

343
00:15:09,556 --> 00:15:11,557
then you'll find that some people are better updating it

344
00:15:11,597 --> 00:15:12,057
than others.

345
00:15:12,657 --> 00:15:15,758
And you really, really want to be as anal as you can

346
00:15:15,798 --> 00:15:18,159
about getting these people to keep the thing up to date,

347
00:15:18,239 --> 00:15:21,200
because as soon as one person stops updating it,

348
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:23,221
then the trust in whatever the whole team is doing

349
00:15:23,301 --> 00:15:24,381
starts to fall apart a little bit.

350
00:15:27,082 --> 00:15:28,383
We use Dropbox for cloud storage.

351
00:15:29,481 --> 00:15:34,505
And I mean there were lots of alternatives to this that are getting as good as Dropbox.

352
00:15:35,126 --> 00:15:40,330
One thing we use it for is internal builds, so I can put a build at project X slash latest

353
00:15:40,990 --> 00:15:44,633
and everyone can know that they can go there to play whatever the latest build is.

354
00:15:44,994 --> 00:15:48,416
They don't have to sync anything from source control, they don't have to install anything.

355
00:15:49,652 --> 00:15:50,754
It's also got some cool little features,

356
00:15:50,774 --> 00:15:54,040
like I can use the OSX native screen grabbing tools,

357
00:15:54,401 --> 00:15:57,807
grab a section of, say, UI that I want to iterate on

358
00:15:58,008 --> 00:16:00,452
or highlight an issue with, and that will put a link to it

359
00:16:00,472 --> 00:16:02,136
directly in my clipboard, and then I can paste that

360
00:16:02,176 --> 00:16:02,576
into chat.

361
00:16:05,096 --> 00:16:06,857
We also have some tools for dealing with time zones.

362
00:16:06,897 --> 00:16:09,218
If you're the guy who's working overnight like I do,

363
00:16:09,878 --> 00:16:11,219
then you want to be really, really ready

364
00:16:11,339 --> 00:16:12,780
for when everyone starts waking up.

365
00:16:12,860 --> 00:16:14,100
Have stuff ready for them to look at

366
00:16:14,261 --> 00:16:15,221
for what you've done during the day

367
00:16:16,041 --> 00:16:17,382
and be logging what you've been doing.

368
00:16:17,422 --> 00:16:18,182
Sometimes they'll wake up

369
00:16:18,202 --> 00:16:20,023
and there'll be a mini essay from me in Skype

370
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:20,784
about what I've been doing.

371
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,365
Also communicate the presence that you have.

372
00:16:25,001 --> 00:16:27,343
I've already shown you that I'll have a gap in the evening

373
00:16:27,363 --> 00:16:28,683
and then I'll come back and I'll leave again.

374
00:16:28,743 --> 00:16:29,964
And I will say both times,

375
00:16:30,485 --> 00:16:33,326
I'm AFK now for a few hours back later.

376
00:16:33,647 --> 00:16:34,527
And then later on in the evening,

377
00:16:34,547 --> 00:16:35,408
I'll say I'm going to bed now.

378
00:16:36,168 --> 00:16:38,590
And I also, if I'm checking Skype on my mobile or something,

379
00:16:38,650 --> 00:16:39,730
like here's an example,

380
00:16:40,291 --> 00:16:42,332
I'm in the bottom text there and I'm saying,

381
00:16:42,932 --> 00:16:45,494
I'm still AFK, but I can help answer your question.

382
00:16:45,534 --> 00:16:48,476
But you're not expect, I'm communicating that

383
00:16:48,616 --> 00:16:50,818
they shouldn't expect me to be able to, you know,

384
00:16:50,838 --> 00:16:52,178
make any code changes or anything like that.

385
00:16:53,665 --> 00:16:56,067
You could also use Google Calendar to sort out time zones

386
00:16:56,287 --> 00:16:57,748
or a tool like World Time Zone Buddy.

387
00:16:59,409 --> 00:17:01,831
And personally, I have a kind of concept in my head

388
00:17:01,931 --> 00:17:05,093
of Spy Fox time, which is kind of West Coast time,

389
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,995
and I know that I'm eight hours behind that,

390
00:17:07,015 --> 00:17:08,796
so if anyone talks about 10 a.m.,

391
00:17:08,816 --> 00:17:10,077
then I know for me that's 6 p.m.

392
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:15,961
So this is perhaps the most interesting area of the talk,

393
00:17:18,543 --> 00:17:21,145
about how do we take this group of people who,

394
00:17:21,850 --> 00:17:23,610
have never ever have ever been in the room together.

395
00:17:24,771 --> 00:17:27,231
How do we take them and then turn them

396
00:17:27,271 --> 00:17:29,772
into a creative team that can work together and trust

397
00:17:29,812 --> 00:17:30,132
each other?

398
00:17:30,152 --> 00:17:33,213
And I think trust is a really, really important aspect

399
00:17:33,233 --> 00:17:33,513
for a team.

400
00:17:33,533 --> 00:17:35,774
You need to know when you can hand off work to someone else.

401
00:17:35,794 --> 00:17:38,135
You need to know what other people's skill areas are.

402
00:17:38,395 --> 00:17:39,615
And you want them to do the same for you.

403
00:17:40,096 --> 00:17:42,736
But a huge part of trust is familiarity.

404
00:17:43,787 --> 00:17:47,591
is getting to know someone and knowing what their foibles are and what they like

405
00:17:47,611 --> 00:17:49,072
and even just what their sense of humor is.

406
00:17:49,413 --> 00:17:52,035
But it's hard to do that when we can't have in-person socializing.

407
00:17:52,055 --> 00:17:54,638
You know, there were time zones and there were oceans in the way

408
00:17:55,118 --> 00:17:56,420
of us getting in the same room together.

409
00:17:57,875 --> 00:17:59,776
So what we try to do, and I haven't actually

410
00:17:59,796 --> 00:18:00,757
thought of a really good term for this.

411
00:18:00,777 --> 00:18:01,818
I'm not quite happy with this term,

412
00:18:02,118 --> 00:18:04,640
but we try to interject this space for personality

413
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:06,041
into our workflows.

414
00:18:06,402 --> 00:18:08,904
So everything that we do, we try and get a little crowbar

415
00:18:08,924 --> 00:18:10,685
in there and just leave a tiny little gap

416
00:18:11,166 --> 00:18:14,428
where we can be ourselves and then everyone can get

417
00:18:14,448 --> 00:18:16,810
to know us just by working with us every day.

418
00:18:18,372 --> 00:18:19,553
The easiest and most obvious way of doing that

419
00:18:19,593 --> 00:18:21,354
is by using video as much as possible.

420
00:18:21,854 --> 00:18:24,757
Not only is it important for getting over those barriers

421
00:18:25,017 --> 00:18:26,318
that text communication has,

422
00:18:27,777 --> 00:18:34,017
But also, just by seeing your face and what jokes you laugh at other people, they can get to know you.

423
00:18:35,493 --> 00:18:39,014
Don't have address code, because you want this to have a really, really low barrier to entry.

424
00:18:39,094 --> 00:18:43,056
There are certain people in the company who shall remain nameless.

425
00:18:43,236 --> 00:18:47,298
Let's just call them David Edery, who I've jumped on a video call with

426
00:18:47,318 --> 00:18:50,379
and he's very obviously still in bed with the headboard behind him and he's just woken up.

427
00:18:50,639 --> 00:18:53,200
But that's fine, because we're having that face-to-face communication

428
00:18:53,260 --> 00:18:57,802
and we're getting that level of fidelity in our communications that we wouldn't have otherwise.

429
00:18:59,122 --> 00:19:01,723
Voice calls are a distant second best. There are some people in the company...

430
00:19:03,437 --> 00:19:04,719
If you're a affiliate or mock company,

431
00:19:04,739 --> 00:19:06,342
you're naturally going to hire people

432
00:19:06,382 --> 00:19:07,444
who are somewhat loners,

433
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:09,487
and then they won't want to jump onto video calls.

434
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,150
So it's kind of self-defeating.

435
00:19:11,551 --> 00:19:12,452
So there are people in the company

436
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:13,334
who will only use voice.

437
00:19:14,471 --> 00:19:16,932
by habit, and it does work, it is better.

438
00:19:16,952 --> 00:19:18,832
It's better than text by far,

439
00:19:19,052 --> 00:19:20,413
but it's a distant second best of video.

440
00:19:21,233 --> 00:19:24,394
One little hack you can do is change your default avatar

441
00:19:24,714 --> 00:19:27,035
to something with your face, and with your eyes,

442
00:19:27,075 --> 00:19:28,535
and with your mouth, not a cartoon,

443
00:19:29,015 --> 00:19:30,035
with your eyes and with your mouth,

444
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:32,136
and then people can look at that as you're talking

445
00:19:32,676 --> 00:19:34,157
in voice call, or they can look at that

446
00:19:34,197 --> 00:19:36,457
as you're typing in text, and that massively, massively

447
00:19:36,497 --> 00:19:40,118
helps people to understand what you're saying, apparently.

448
00:19:41,739 --> 00:19:43,119
So we have a biweekly company call.

449
00:19:45,027 --> 00:19:48,250
that we schedule on a Monday in the morning

450
00:19:48,330 --> 00:19:49,872
for West Coast people and in the evening for me.

451
00:19:50,312 --> 00:19:52,214
And that's just for sharing information

452
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,496
between the different projects,

453
00:19:54,976 --> 00:19:56,838
because there's obviously no,

454
00:19:57,158 --> 00:19:58,820
I can't walk past someone else's desk

455
00:19:59,441 --> 00:20:00,902
and accidentally see what they're working on

456
00:20:00,942 --> 00:20:01,943
and say, oh, that's cool, show me,

457
00:20:02,323 --> 00:20:03,985
because there is no desk for me to walk past.

458
00:20:04,265 --> 00:20:05,606
So instead we do it on this call.

459
00:20:06,628 --> 00:20:10,412
And we also have biweekly one-on-ones with Dave or Daniel,

460
00:20:10,452 --> 00:20:13,255
our co-founders, and that's a chance for us to talk about

461
00:20:13,956 --> 00:20:15,338
personal issues or professional issues,

462
00:20:15,358 --> 00:20:16,119
professional development.

463
00:20:16,619 --> 00:20:18,481
And you'll notice that that's a much, much higher frequency

464
00:20:18,521 --> 00:20:20,544
than you might be used to in a co-located team.

465
00:20:21,104 --> 00:20:22,205
That's because, like I've said,

466
00:20:22,265 --> 00:20:25,009
it's so much easier for these issues to develop quickly

467
00:20:25,129 --> 00:20:26,951
and slip through the cracks with a remote team.

468
00:20:29,004 --> 00:20:31,145
We have two global chat rooms, one for random chat

469
00:20:31,165 --> 00:20:32,785
and one for company business, although we're not

470
00:20:33,345 --> 00:20:35,466
actually that strict about what goes where.

471
00:20:35,486 --> 00:20:37,227
We're not going to shout at anyone for doing that.

472
00:20:38,887 --> 00:20:41,328
And again, it's just a space where you can be yourself.

473
00:20:41,368 --> 00:20:43,029
And if something cool comes up in the news,

474
00:20:43,089 --> 00:20:44,869
like say Valve's VR news the other day,

475
00:20:44,889 --> 00:20:47,190
then that will go into the global chat

476
00:20:47,210 --> 00:20:48,810
and we can talk about it for a minute

477
00:20:48,910 --> 00:20:50,171
and what it means for the industry.

478
00:20:52,130 --> 00:20:56,273
One little thing that we have, and this is such a tiny little thing, once I've explained it, you'll be like,

479
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:59,695
what? Is that really? But it made such a big difference when we started doing it,

480
00:21:00,456 --> 00:21:05,720
is that when we sit down in the morning and you're ready to start working as a SpyFox,

481
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:09,643
then you open the chat client and you type in good morning and you hit enter, and that's it.

482
00:21:11,104 --> 00:21:16,668
And there's no expectation of reply for this, so it's important that the tenth person to start work doesn't get nine replies saying good morning.

483
00:21:17,853 --> 00:21:18,753
But it's doing several things.

484
00:21:18,953 --> 00:21:20,494
So it's communicating presence, obviously,

485
00:21:20,514 --> 00:21:21,774
it's saying I'm here, I'm ready to work,

486
00:21:22,254 --> 00:21:23,535
but it's also random noise,

487
00:21:23,675 --> 00:21:25,055
and it stops that sometimes, you know,

488
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:27,656
if there's no Valve VR announcement for a couple of days,

489
00:21:27,876 --> 00:21:30,237
then that global chat can sometimes be a bit quiet.

490
00:21:30,537 --> 00:21:31,857
But this way, there's just a little bit

491
00:21:31,897 --> 00:21:32,758
of random noise in there,

492
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:34,598
and it starts to feel more like a company

493
00:21:35,018 --> 00:21:36,259
rather than a bunch of contractors

494
00:21:36,299 --> 00:21:37,619
who happen to be on the same Skype channel.

495
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,461
And it's a little bit of space for personality.

496
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:42,562
I mean, you can use whatever method you like

497
00:21:42,662 --> 00:21:44,043
for saying hello.

498
00:21:44,063 --> 00:21:45,264
Some people do it in different languages.

499
00:21:45,865 --> 00:21:48,347
I went through a phase of Googling Shakespearean greetings.

500
00:21:48,427 --> 00:21:49,528
We also have different flavors.

501
00:21:49,588 --> 00:21:51,869
So, for instance, Jukebox Tuesdays

502
00:21:51,929 --> 00:21:53,130
is where you say good morning

503
00:21:53,150 --> 00:21:54,671
by saying what you're listening to right now.

504
00:21:58,715 --> 00:22:02,616
birthdays are a really interesting social experience.

505
00:22:03,357 --> 00:22:04,958
There's something that's just a little bit special

506
00:22:05,018 --> 00:22:06,398
about having a birthday in a team.

507
00:22:07,059 --> 00:22:09,099
In a co-located team, maybe you all go in the kitchen

508
00:22:09,119 --> 00:22:10,880
and you cut some cake and you wish happy birthday

509
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,302
to the person, but we can't do that

510
00:22:14,322 --> 00:22:15,262
because we haven't got a kitchen.

511
00:22:16,223 --> 00:22:19,224
So instead what we do is we open up a secret chat group

512
00:22:19,444 --> 00:22:21,165
with everyone apart from the birthday person in there.

513
00:22:21,485 --> 00:22:22,866
It's supposed to be a few days beforehand,

514
00:22:22,906 --> 00:22:23,826
but because we're a bit rubbish,

515
00:22:23,866 --> 00:22:25,287
it's normally the day of the person's birthday.

516
00:22:26,953 --> 00:22:29,713
And we'll all be in there, and we'll open up a collaborative drawing tool that,

517
00:22:29,813 --> 00:22:32,074
like, at the moment, we tend to use Google Docs again.

518
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:36,655
And we'll all draw silly pictures, and we'll, like, write birthday messages for the person.

519
00:22:37,055 --> 00:22:39,155
Here's some of the examples that we do.

520
00:22:39,795 --> 00:22:42,636
And, you know, it's important that, like, art style is no barrier here,

521
00:22:43,076 --> 00:22:44,176
although these are some of the better ones.

522
00:22:46,776 --> 00:22:49,577
I particularly like, for instance, Pat's dreamy eyes in the top left.

523
00:22:50,137 --> 00:22:52,598
They're pretty cool. Pat's on the front row, by the way, if you're interested.

524
00:22:52,618 --> 00:22:54,058
But unfortunately, he is taken, so...

525
00:22:55,730 --> 00:22:58,131
But it's great, I mean this is as much for

526
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:03,033
the other people in SpyFox as it is for the person whose birthday it is.

527
00:23:03,053 --> 00:23:04,734
The person whose birthday it is gets

528
00:23:04,754 --> 00:23:08,296
a URL at the end of the day and he gets to open it and say thank you, but

529
00:23:09,136 --> 00:23:10,797
before that, everyone else has had this great

530
00:23:11,317 --> 00:23:13,698
shared experience where we've been bouncing ideas back and forth

531
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:16,359
and then laughing at each other's jokes or terrible artwork or something.

532
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:20,881
And again, it's a space of personality, a space to express yourself within our normal workflows.

533
00:23:22,459 --> 00:23:23,800
There are also some things that haven't worked as well.

534
00:23:23,960 --> 00:23:26,322
So weekly multiplayer seemed like a really good idea

535
00:23:26,342 --> 00:23:27,263
for getting to know each other,

536
00:23:27,583 --> 00:23:28,744
but it didn't really stick,

537
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:30,145
possibly because of time zones.

538
00:23:30,545 --> 00:23:32,066
It's very difficult for me, for instance,

539
00:23:32,106 --> 00:23:34,008
to stay up to 3 a.m. in the morning

540
00:23:34,028 --> 00:23:36,450
for when everyone else finishes working.

541
00:23:37,631 --> 00:23:38,551
But if you are going to try it,

542
00:23:38,571 --> 00:23:39,632
then you want to favor games

543
00:23:39,692 --> 00:23:41,013
that are collaborative and chatty,

544
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:43,815
rather than games that are more frantic.

545
00:23:43,875 --> 00:23:46,557
So for instance, Minecraft is a much better experience

546
00:23:47,138 --> 00:23:48,419
because you have that day-night cycle

547
00:23:48,459 --> 00:23:50,420
and you can stop and talk and plan than...

548
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:53,012
say, Team Fortress 2, which is just non-non-stop.

549
00:23:53,332 --> 00:23:55,153
Actually, we found it quite difficult to find games

550
00:23:55,173 --> 00:23:56,934
that have this property, so maybe there's

551
00:23:56,954 --> 00:23:57,774
a potential market there.

552
00:23:58,695 --> 00:24:00,916
We're actually, one of our projects we're working on

553
00:24:00,936 --> 00:24:02,817
at the moment, we're kind of viewing through this lens,

554
00:24:02,857 --> 00:24:04,678
so it's kind of an interesting space to be in.

555
00:24:06,119 --> 00:24:06,640
So that's all I got.

556
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:07,600
To recap then.

557
00:24:09,018 --> 00:24:10,699
Team building is really hard for a remote team.

558
00:24:11,139 --> 00:24:14,321
If you can inject space and personality into your workflows,

559
00:24:14,341 --> 00:24:16,082
then it becomes easier and you can start to build

560
00:24:16,122 --> 00:24:17,043
that trust that you need.

561
00:24:17,963 --> 00:24:20,745
Communication takes so much effort, so much time.

562
00:24:20,765 --> 00:24:22,286
I mean, I'm gonna say it to you

563
00:24:22,306 --> 00:24:23,226
that communication takes effort,

564
00:24:23,547 --> 00:24:24,307
and then you're gonna leave here

565
00:24:24,347 --> 00:24:25,488
thinking communication takes effort.

566
00:24:25,528 --> 00:24:26,849
And if you actually tried it, you're gonna be like,

567
00:24:26,869 --> 00:24:28,129
holy shit, this takes a lot of effort.

568
00:24:28,710 --> 00:24:29,730
It's gonna surprise you.

569
00:24:30,911 --> 00:24:33,432
And the workflows I've shown you here

570
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:34,953
don't scale well beyond 10 people.

571
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:38,780
However, it's an extremely, extremely productive

572
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,321
environment.

573
00:24:39,641 --> 00:24:43,326
You can get so much done focusing and really getting

574
00:24:43,346 --> 00:24:45,229
in the zone in what you're doing without people distracting you.

575
00:24:45,790 --> 00:24:46,991
And if you could put people together

576
00:24:47,011 --> 00:24:49,755
from a huge talent pool who trust each other

577
00:24:49,795 --> 00:24:52,699
and are talented, then together you can make great games.

578
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,385
So I'm going to leave you with some resources.

579
00:24:55,425 --> 00:24:56,585
There's some communities there,

580
00:24:57,006 --> 00:24:57,986
Stack Exchange and Reddit.

581
00:24:58,006 --> 00:25:00,067
And there's also, I was going to put some blogs up,

582
00:25:00,147 --> 00:25:02,909
but this GitHub page has got a fantastic community resource

583
00:25:02,949 --> 00:25:04,670
of all kinds of blogs and books that you should look at.

584
00:25:05,430 --> 00:25:07,211
The slides will be on my website in due course.

585
00:25:07,251 --> 00:25:09,152
You should check out spyfox.com for our latest games.

586
00:25:09,553 --> 00:25:11,814
And you should follow me on Twitter at TENPN.

587
00:25:12,154 --> 00:25:12,674
Thank you very much.

588
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:22,780
I'm not sure if we have any time for questions, do we?

589
00:25:24,401 --> 00:25:24,662
We do.

590
00:25:25,564 --> 00:25:26,326
Yes, OK, good man.

591
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:27,970
Hi.

592
00:25:34,292 --> 00:25:36,153
The question is, do we have a chat client that we use?

593
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:37,874
Yeah, so we use Skype.

594
00:25:38,634 --> 00:25:40,015
We're always looking at other ones

595
00:25:40,055 --> 00:25:42,756
to see what they can bring to the table, though,

596
00:25:42,776 --> 00:25:44,217
because Skype has got its issues.

597
00:25:44,277 --> 00:25:46,799
But I mean, the video chatting in Skype

598
00:25:46,839 --> 00:25:48,119
is so much better than almost,

599
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,160
I mean, even better than Google Hangouts in some ways.

600
00:25:50,481 --> 00:25:52,182
Like, Google Hangouts is fantastic,

601
00:25:52,442 --> 00:25:53,662
but it caps out at 10 people,

602
00:25:53,983 --> 00:25:55,443
but we've got 11 people in the company,

603
00:25:55,503 --> 00:25:57,284
so it makes it kind of hard to use.

604
00:25:59,446 --> 00:26:00,046
Yes, thank you.

605
00:26:02,827 --> 00:26:03,248
Sorry, what was that?

606
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:06,581
Go to meeting as well, at least for the video chat,

607
00:26:06,601 --> 00:26:08,081
if you need to also share screen.

608
00:26:08,662 --> 00:26:10,182
Okay, cool.

609
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:10,582
Next question.

610
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:12,383
I got two quick ones.

611
00:26:12,543 --> 00:26:14,384
One is what do you use for source control?

612
00:26:15,144 --> 00:26:18,025
And the second one is how do you deal with

613
00:26:18,325 --> 00:26:20,326
the chores piling up and distracting you

614
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:21,286
when you're working from home?

615
00:26:22,166 --> 00:26:23,266
The distractions of working from home?

616
00:26:23,407 --> 00:26:25,847
Yeah, like, you know, laundry's piling up

617
00:26:25,907 --> 00:26:27,448
or there's some dishes you need to clean.

618
00:26:27,688 --> 00:26:29,228
Like, that seems to be a big distraction.

619
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:33,873
So for source control, it's really up to the individual teams.

620
00:26:33,913 --> 00:26:36,334
We've settled on Git and Mercurial

621
00:26:37,055 --> 00:26:39,837
because they are quite good distributed and redistributed teams,

622
00:26:39,857 --> 00:26:42,159
so it seems like using distributed source code might be a good idea.

623
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,240
Do you have somebody host it or is it private?

624
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,461
We host it ourselves on our own server.

625
00:26:47,442 --> 00:26:49,024
And to avoid distractions, well,

626
00:26:50,405 --> 00:26:51,826
routines and headphones help.

627
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:55,351
getting yourself up, getting yourself dressed,

628
00:26:55,371 --> 00:26:56,531
getting yourself showered and sitting down

629
00:26:56,591 --> 00:26:58,752
and knowing that now you're gonna be focusing on working,

630
00:26:58,792 --> 00:26:59,753
giving yourself a timetable.

631
00:27:00,193 --> 00:27:02,674
Lunch is gonna be from 12.30 or whatever

632
00:27:02,694 --> 00:27:04,155
and knowing that you're not gonna stop until then.

633
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,556
Those are really good for getting yourself into the groove.

634
00:27:06,816 --> 00:27:08,016
But then once you're in that groove,

635
00:27:08,536 --> 00:27:09,437
then at least for me,

636
00:27:09,557 --> 00:27:11,738
I found that I can then relax that schedule quite a lot

637
00:27:12,018 --> 00:27:14,679
and I'm still able to jump in to like start working

638
00:27:14,999 --> 00:27:17,820
and get my hours done without getting distracted too much.

639
00:27:18,780 --> 00:27:19,440
Yeah, over that side.

640
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:21,162
So I apologize if you already mentioned it,

641
00:27:21,182 --> 00:27:23,944
but I was wondering if you had found a good collaboration tool

642
00:27:24,044 --> 00:27:27,386
for technical drawing that works on both tablets and PC?

643
00:27:28,807 --> 00:27:29,848
No, we haven't really looked.

644
00:27:29,988 --> 00:27:32,290
I mean, we were looking for collaborative drawing

645
00:27:32,630 --> 00:27:35,072
for the birthdays thing, as much as anything.

646
00:27:35,272 --> 00:27:36,673
So what do you guys use for, like,

647
00:27:37,274 --> 00:27:38,695
shared whiteboarding session type?

648
00:27:39,836 --> 00:27:41,137
We just tend to just hash it out,

649
00:27:41,237 --> 00:27:42,798
or we'll hash it out over voice chat,

650
00:27:43,498 --> 00:27:44,599
leave notes in the Skype group,

651
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:47,621
or we will just leave it to one person

652
00:27:47,641 --> 00:27:48,522
and trust them to get it right.

653
00:27:49,451 --> 00:27:49,671
Thank you.

654
00:27:52,112 --> 00:27:52,352
Thanks.

655
00:27:52,392 --> 00:27:52,552
Thanks.

656
00:27:52,572 --> 00:27:54,773
This is less of a question, more of a statement.

657
00:27:55,534 --> 00:28:00,596
I worked remotely for about 10 years on a 50-person team, and I agree that it's harder

658
00:28:00,636 --> 00:28:05,578
with such a larger team, but one of the things that I think is really important is don't

659
00:28:05,638 --> 00:28:07,578
be afraid to bother other people.

660
00:28:08,304 --> 00:28:18,514
Because if you don't bother them, then you generally won't get a sense of what's going on with other people if they're not willing to, you know, kind of bring it forth themselves.

661
00:28:19,154 --> 00:28:24,460
So don't be afraid to talk up and bother other people you think are busy.

662
00:28:24,980 --> 00:28:28,163
Yeah, overshare. Yeah, good comment. Anyone on this side?

663
00:28:28,944 --> 00:28:31,286
First of all, I want to ask you if you've ever tried using SocoCo?

664
00:28:31,956 --> 00:28:32,456
So, Cocoa?

665
00:28:32,716 --> 00:28:32,996
Yes.

666
00:28:33,016 --> 00:28:33,697
I haven't even heard of it.

667
00:28:33,717 --> 00:28:33,917
What is it?

668
00:28:33,937 --> 00:28:35,957
Hands down, better than anything I've seen.

669
00:28:36,477 --> 00:28:37,558
So, that's just a tip.

670
00:28:37,598 --> 00:28:38,198
For what?

671
00:28:38,558 --> 00:28:43,720
Video chatting, sharing screens, it's a virtual map of an office and it works really well.

672
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,560
Okay, check it out.

673
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,381
Anyways, S-O-C-O-C-O.

674
00:28:49,602 --> 00:28:51,562
Have you tried any virtual team building?

675
00:28:51,582 --> 00:28:54,463
I'm really interested on what you could do in a team building type.

676
00:28:55,955 --> 00:28:57,336
outside of obviously playing games,

677
00:28:57,356 --> 00:28:58,477
because that's what everybody's into,

678
00:28:58,497 --> 00:29:02,099
but just specifically for building that trust,

679
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,199
especially with new teams?

680
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,462
Well, I mean, like I said, we tried to do that in,

681
00:29:07,802 --> 00:29:09,503
like we tried to build that into everything we're doing,

682
00:29:09,523 --> 00:29:10,523
like the birthdays thing.

683
00:29:12,144 --> 00:29:15,546
One thing that we tried,

684
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:17,547
we tried the video gaming.

685
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:25,207
thing and it didn't really take off. One thing we did do was we made a silly stupid video for

686
00:29:25,887 --> 00:29:31,048
use what's the what what the fox say which was like a big youtube thing last year and we made

687
00:29:31,088 --> 00:29:35,029
a silly video of all us miming to it and we're sending it back and forth over like a number of

688
00:29:35,049 --> 00:29:37,989
weeks sending each other little clips to put into the video and that was quite a good experience

689
00:29:39,250 --> 00:29:43,850
so we should we should we should do that again someone needs to make another viral fox song

690
00:29:45,311 --> 00:29:45,791
yeah in the middle

691
00:29:48,682 --> 00:30:00,132
So, do you have a developed process for sort of identifying where issues arise in remote collaboration,

692
00:30:00,172 --> 00:30:09,060
like collaborators that aren't really working well with the, or sort of problems in the collaborative structure of this,

693
00:30:09,240 --> 00:30:12,343
basically just debugging the process, essentially?

694
00:30:12,623 --> 00:30:13,504
Yeah, so we...

695
00:30:15,248 --> 00:30:17,512
We come by that by just being really, really open with each other.

696
00:30:17,933 --> 00:30:19,796
And when you've got small team sizes,

697
00:30:19,836 --> 00:30:22,421
then problem people do highlight themselves much more obviously.

698
00:30:24,064 --> 00:30:24,806
And, uh...

699
00:30:26,014 --> 00:30:30,556
it's very easy for someone to bring something up in the company talk and then

700
00:30:30,756 --> 00:30:34,837
like the good morning thing, like that becoming company policy was just me

701
00:30:34,877 --> 00:30:38,799
saying, hey, we should do this thing and then the next day it was company policy.

702
00:30:38,819 --> 00:30:42,600
You know, we could we like the the owners of the company are really, really

703
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:46,161
open and easy to talk to.

704
00:30:46,241 --> 00:30:47,842
And the whole team trusts each other so

705
00:30:47,882 --> 00:30:49,723
well that we can discuss this kind of stuff quite easily.

706
00:30:50,103 --> 00:30:52,924
So a team member can, if they're having problems.

707
00:30:54,712 --> 00:30:58,536
they bring it up or you bring it up and you talk it out basically.

708
00:30:58,636 --> 00:31:01,459
Yes, because like I said, the people you're hiring should be self-aware,

709
00:31:01,499 --> 00:31:03,901
they should be, you know, they want to be bringing these problems to you

710
00:31:03,941 --> 00:31:05,262
as much as you're bringing the problems to them.

711
00:31:06,403 --> 00:31:10,127
And yeah, we just, we get by by hiring really great people.

712
00:31:11,548 --> 00:31:11,868
Thank you.

713
00:31:12,129 --> 00:31:14,311
Yeah, one on the right and I think then we're done.

714
00:31:14,991 --> 00:31:15,612
Oh no, we're done now.

715
00:31:16,393 --> 00:31:16,773
We're done now.

716
00:31:17,474 --> 00:31:19,656
Okay, we've got the wrap-up room now, I think, which is where?

717
00:31:22,971 --> 00:31:25,058
Room 3000, so if anyone wants to come to room 3000,

718
00:31:25,158 --> 00:31:26,101
then we'll do some more wrap up.

719
00:31:27,606 --> 00:31:28,529
Or just outside in the hallway.

720
00:31:28,951 --> 00:31:29,332
Thanks very much.
