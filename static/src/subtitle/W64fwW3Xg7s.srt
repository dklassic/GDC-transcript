1
00:00:08,761 --> 00:00:12,763
We'd like to welcome our speaker today, Kevin Aguazza.

2
00:00:13,123 --> 00:00:17,545
He's a gameplay programmer at Studio Gobo out of Brighton, UK,

3
00:00:17,645 --> 00:00:19,426
working on an unannounced AAA game.

4
00:00:19,446 --> 00:00:23,588
A treasurer at Game Workers Unite, UK.

5
00:00:26,167 --> 00:00:30,450
In chat, you can ask Kevin about the state of unionization

6
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:34,052
in the global games industry, how unions may affect the game

7
00:00:34,092 --> 00:00:36,294
industry, things like that.

8
00:00:36,454 --> 00:00:39,656
So we're going to try to steer clear away

9
00:00:39,736 --> 00:00:45,400
from topics that involve very specific country-based labor

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:45,721
laws.

11
00:00:46,201 --> 00:00:48,102
So if you could just keep that in mind.

12
00:00:49,223 --> 00:00:53,866
So Kevin, if you're ready, you want to take the first question?

13
00:00:55,222 --> 00:00:59,184
All right, the first one comes from Grant Chen, who says,

14
00:00:59,204 --> 00:01:04,486
uh, I'm okay with my working conditions, but I'm worried about the industry as a whole.

15
00:01:05,126 --> 00:01:08,348
Should I be trying to push for unions at my current job,

16
00:01:08,708 --> 00:01:13,470
or should I try to help others unionize? What actions should I take? Great question.

17
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:17,092
Right. Um, so I think it's very, very good that you want to like,

18
00:01:17,672 --> 00:01:19,072
help make the industry a better place.

19
00:01:21,368 --> 00:01:27,309
And I think in your situation, the first thing you might do is to just go to your

20
00:01:27,329 --> 00:01:32,710
work colleagues and speak to them and ask them how they feel about their job, what

21
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:40,612
their problems are, how things are going, and just try to get an oversight, an

22
00:01:40,672 --> 00:01:46,213
overview of what the problems and positive things are that your colleagues have to

23
00:01:46,253 --> 00:01:49,413
say about your work and sort of get an overview about their particular

24
00:01:50,323 --> 00:02:05,467
Particular groups of people that have particular issues, you know, certain minorities or women or other, or a particular department, like maybe, you know, the team lead of the programmers is very different management style, let's say, than maybe the game designer.

25
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:17,169
And so trying to figure out in your own company, speaking just to your colleagues sort of casually, you know, how they feel about work, what are the issues and what might they be able to do about it.

26
00:02:17,549 --> 00:02:19,430
As somebody in the past tried to like.

27
00:02:20,864 --> 00:02:27,669
Improve something or go to HR or start a, like, maybe a group for women or something like that.

28
00:02:27,689 --> 00:02:31,772
Did something like that happen in the past? How did it go? Why did it fail? Why did it succeed?

29
00:02:31,812 --> 00:02:35,955
And sort of try to work out how your workplace is structured and what the issues are and

30
00:02:36,435 --> 00:02:39,958
how, trying to figure out how you can improve it with your colleagues. And then

31
00:02:39,978 --> 00:02:46,122
that's sort of the very, very first step of organizing. At some point you might decide,

32
00:02:46,162 --> 00:02:49,745
hey, I need help with, like, legal advice on manpower or...

33
00:02:50,894 --> 00:02:54,776
You know, capacities, you might get in contact with union or set to join a union with your colleagues.

34
00:02:55,056 --> 00:02:59,898
And then that union will help you do that, what I just described, more effectively and more streamlined.

35
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:02,840
Great.

36
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:06,822
We have another question from Kabir Seth.

37
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:15,025
How do you feel about game developers not being given overtime pay due to them being exempt from FLSA?

38
00:03:15,646 --> 00:03:18,467
Would the union try to make changes to this law?

39
00:03:21,467 --> 00:03:23,309
I'll be citing the specific law a bit.

40
00:03:23,649 --> 00:03:24,270
Okay.

41
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:25,010
But it's fine.

42
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:26,031
But like in general,

43
00:03:26,051 --> 00:03:29,073
so that most of the time in this use,

44
00:03:29,774 --> 00:03:34,798
some paid, I think it was like three quarters out of,

45
00:03:35,038 --> 00:03:37,180
at in 2017 in a survey, but it might be slightly off there.

46
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:39,102
And also, so it depends the country and local labor laws.

47
00:03:39,982 --> 00:03:40,223
Right?

48
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,404
Some countries, overtime is mandatory,

49
00:03:42,945 --> 00:03:43,825
and some countries it's not.

50
00:03:43,986 --> 00:03:44,346
But I want...

51
00:03:45,204 --> 00:03:52,552
situation we run into, particularly in the UK, is that we have workers that are wrongly classified,

52
00:03:52,572 --> 00:03:59,680
for example, as zero-hour contractors or just contractors, when really they should be classified as an

53
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:03,983
Employees can get the full benefits. One of the things you went into is situations where you might

54
00:04:04,003 --> 00:04:09,607
fight to get you reclassified from being, you know, an outside contractor with no overtime pay

55
00:04:09,687 --> 00:04:14,950
into being a full employee with maybe statutory overtime pay. There's one avenue you might go

56
00:04:14,990 --> 00:04:21,134
about doing that. All these other things that might be happening, especially with like huge

57
00:04:23,079 --> 00:04:39,371
long periods of overtime you can run into in the UK for example into super hard labor law violations on break time and rest periods like for example in a 14 day time span you need to have at least one

58
00:04:40,028 --> 00:04:42,111
An entire day we're not working at all.

59
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,876
If you come in the office for six, sorry, seven days straight, Monday to

60
00:04:45,916 --> 00:04:50,762
Sunday, then you do the same day the next week, it's a hard, hard break time

61
00:04:50,782 --> 00:04:55,228
violation in the UK and, you know, there are legal avenues, so we usually

62
00:04:55,248 --> 00:04:57,711
don't start with like the full lawsuit legal avenue, you know.

63
00:04:58,041 --> 00:05:01,606
We tried to talk to other people at the company and said, and it's very

64
00:05:01,626 --> 00:05:03,149
difficult, are other people working overtime?

65
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:03,950
Is it unpaid?

66
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:04,831
How much do you work?

67
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:06,694
Do some people get paid and other people not?

68
00:05:07,195 --> 00:05:09,879
Um, do some people get paid more overtime than others?

69
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:13,792
We then see a case where in a language translation,

70
00:05:14,933 --> 00:05:16,955
sort of Nordic, Nord,

71
00:05:17,255 --> 00:05:19,597
Nord-European languages were paid at a higher rate

72
00:05:19,637 --> 00:05:21,458
than South-European languages,

73
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,100
which there were cases in the past

74
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:28,324
where that was a basis for like a discriminatory suit

75
00:05:28,424 --> 00:05:32,507
based on self-discrimination towards more believer

76
00:05:32,547 --> 00:05:36,530
in southern languages being paid differently in like rates.

77
00:05:38,969 --> 00:05:41,212
But sort of the puzzle would be trying to figure out,

78
00:05:41,792 --> 00:05:43,534
try to get an overview of what's happening in the tech company

79
00:05:43,554 --> 00:05:44,395
who got overtime pay.

80
00:05:46,177 --> 00:05:48,300
Then approach management just informally.

81
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,523
Probably you might do that.

82
00:05:51,664 --> 00:05:53,285
Then the union approaching management informally.

83
00:05:53,526 --> 00:05:55,168
Then say, okay, this is the state and we might,

84
00:05:55,228 --> 00:05:59,172
and we think there might be a case for a lawsuit.

85
00:06:00,283 --> 00:06:04,225
or another avenue, or there has been an accumulation in the past,

86
00:06:04,345 --> 00:06:06,546
and here's what we will do if you don't fix it.

87
00:06:06,966 --> 00:06:10,788
Then, you know, we slightly escalate bit by bit into maybe doing a full-blown lawsuit

88
00:06:11,188 --> 00:06:11,869
or something else.

89
00:06:13,209 --> 00:06:19,032
Maybe, you know, sometimes even bosses don't really know labor law.

90
00:06:20,322 --> 00:06:22,723
All that well, especially in big international companies.

91
00:06:22,743 --> 00:06:26,244
So sometimes they're like, Oh, I didn't know that you couldn't do that.

92
00:06:26,525 --> 00:06:29,466
So I just need to sort of focus and say, Hey, what you're doing here is really not

93
00:06:29,566 --> 00:06:29,926
okay.

94
00:06:30,006 --> 00:06:32,347
And then they're like, Oh, sometimes that does happen.

95
00:06:34,047 --> 00:06:35,788
Bosses don't know everything.

96
00:06:35,948 --> 00:06:37,269
Let's keep that in mind.

97
00:06:38,329 --> 00:06:43,511
Olivia Schwerz asks, any best practices for someone new to the industry who has

98
00:06:43,591 --> 00:06:46,712
concerns about reported working conditions?

99
00:06:48,564 --> 00:06:55,587
Mm-hmm. I mean, I think if, like, sort of before your first job,

100
00:06:55,607 --> 00:06:58,549
you're looking for a first job, and you don't have, like, many

101
00:06:58,589 --> 00:07:02,951
industry contacts, it's hard to, like, get access to the Zoom

102
00:07:02,971 --> 00:07:05,952
memo, right, where people are just sort of casually at

103
00:07:05,992 --> 00:07:08,794
conferences that, you know, in corona times don't really exist

104
00:07:08,814 --> 00:07:11,575
in the same way. Or local meetups, they just, you know,

105
00:07:11,615 --> 00:07:15,037
talk about the workplace. And usually I'd say that if

106
00:07:15,117 --> 00:07:17,618
you finish it in a job or a location, you know.

107
00:07:18,518 --> 00:07:22,761
Go to local events, go to conferences, try to speak to people, figure out what they think

108
00:07:22,801 --> 00:07:23,461
about the employer.

109
00:07:23,481 --> 00:07:27,424
And usually, after a beer or two, they will tell you a lot, probably more than they should.

110
00:07:28,965 --> 00:07:30,666
It's a little bit harder to do.

111
00:07:31,206 --> 00:07:31,826
It's corona.

112
00:07:32,027 --> 00:07:34,868
People don't usually just gather in large masses anymore.

113
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:38,151
So you can...

114
00:07:38,231 --> 00:07:39,331
And this happened to me.

115
00:07:40,912 --> 00:07:45,095
Someone just hit me up on LinkedIn and I was like, hey, can I ask you a couple of questions

116
00:07:45,175 --> 00:07:46,636
about your company?

117
00:07:46,736 --> 00:07:47,317
Do you like it there?

118
00:07:47,337 --> 00:07:48,177
And I was like, sure.

119
00:07:48,787 --> 00:07:52,851
I have that personality. I can try to identify people that work there, try to speak to them,

120
00:07:53,952 --> 00:07:58,976
see what they think. If you're already working there, it's a larger company,

121
00:07:58,996 --> 00:08:05,161
as I said, it might be entirely possible that certain apartments or locations or buildings or

122
00:08:05,181 --> 00:08:10,105
other sort of splits have very different conditions and issues than other ones.

123
00:08:10,765 --> 00:08:15,529
So it's always good to speak to your colleagues, especially more diverse ones.

124
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:18,602
If you're a man, try to speak to some women.

125
00:08:18,662 --> 00:08:21,446
If you're a white person, try to speak to some people of color and see what their

126
00:08:21,466 --> 00:08:24,890
experience is like at a company to get a better overview of parts of the

127
00:08:24,910 --> 00:08:25,952
entire company culture.

128
00:08:25,972 --> 00:08:29,296
Great.

129
00:08:31,060 --> 00:08:32,381
Great questions so far.

130
00:08:32,461 --> 00:08:32,942
Keep them coming.

131
00:08:32,962 --> 00:08:34,143
I'll try to get them all in here.

132
00:08:35,143 --> 00:08:36,805
This one's from Becky Grady.

133
00:08:37,705 --> 00:08:40,287
There are so many different roles in the games industry,

134
00:08:40,327 --> 00:08:44,330
developers, designers, project managers, community, et cetera,

135
00:08:44,530 --> 00:08:46,872
who have very different needs and challenges.

136
00:08:47,672 --> 00:08:50,214
Are current initiatives looking to unionize

137
00:08:50,434 --> 00:08:52,036
games industry workers as a whole

138
00:08:52,316 --> 00:08:57,359
or focusing on one area, specifically one discipline?

139
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,541
And how will that choice affect the contracts, expectations, timelines, etc.?

140
00:09:04,061 --> 00:09:05,262
Sure.

141
00:09:06,482 --> 00:09:12,184
I think the situation at least was that the sort of small bits of the games in the Swedish

142
00:09:12,204 --> 00:09:15,305
international unit have been unionized for a longer time.

143
00:09:16,225 --> 00:09:21,266
Usually very specific roles that are sort of coming from other industries, like after

144
00:09:21,346 --> 00:09:23,967
before the emergence of SEG to become SEG-AFTRA in the US.

145
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:27,862
They had their first interactive media agreement, right?

146
00:09:27,882 --> 00:09:32,325
They didn't even use the term video games back then, in 1993, sort of laying

147
00:09:32,385 --> 00:09:36,848
out the conditions for voice actors to work in interactive media, slash the

148
00:09:36,888 --> 00:09:41,691
games industry, and that's nearly 30 years ago.

149
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:42,151
Oh my God.

150
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:42,471
Wow.

151
00:09:42,791 --> 00:09:43,772
It's nearly 30 years ago.

152
00:09:43,792 --> 00:09:48,635
Um, but it's a long time ago and you know, you have voice actors.

153
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:58,082
motion capture artists, sometimes writers, or other like more specific, you know, people

154
00:09:58,102 --> 00:10:02,865
that have specific skills that are applicable to modern games industry, usually oftentimes

155
00:10:02,985 --> 00:10:07,808
come from outside group existing union experience of membership into the games industry.

156
00:10:09,029 --> 00:10:14,653
And I think that has worked to some degree for, you know, if you happen to have that

157
00:10:14,673 --> 00:10:15,533
very specific skill set.

158
00:10:17,761 --> 00:10:21,823
But the plan of what you see, the new unions coming up,

159
00:10:22,904 --> 00:10:24,265
GamesWorks UK in the UK,

160
00:10:24,985 --> 00:10:25,885
Sparta AWGB,

161
00:10:27,506 --> 00:10:29,547
GamesWorks United Ireland in Ireland,

162
00:10:30,168 --> 00:10:32,409
as part of the Financial Services Union,

163
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:35,251
GamesWorks Finland as part of

164
00:10:36,397 --> 00:10:41,321
I finished on that I forgot and as well as the union, which

165
00:10:41,362 --> 00:10:45,985
popped up recently in France, they all aim to unionize the

166
00:10:46,026 --> 00:10:49,669
entire industry across disciplines. To a certain

167
00:10:49,689 --> 00:10:52,471
degree, we had discussions about like, what about people in

168
00:10:52,531 --> 00:10:56,014
eSports, professional eSports players, game journalists,

169
00:10:57,555 --> 00:11:01,679
contractors, people working in finance, people working in the

170
00:11:01,719 --> 00:11:03,120
cafeteria of your building.

171
00:11:03,836 --> 00:11:06,919
you know, helping to make the environment conductive to making good games.

172
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:11,082
Where do we sort of draw the line? And at least in the UK we said,

173
00:11:11,102 --> 00:11:15,906
okay, everybody who works at a company that makes games

174
00:11:17,968 --> 00:11:21,030
or a department that makes games predominantly, they can join the union.

175
00:11:22,711 --> 00:11:29,177
So they could be a writer, an artist, a programmer like I am, or whatever.

176
00:11:29,197 --> 00:11:31,659
The idea being that

177
00:11:33,725 --> 00:11:35,306
First of all, there's strength in solidarity.

178
00:11:35,746 --> 00:11:42,532
The more people across the company, the more employees across the company, trying to achieve

179
00:11:42,552 --> 00:11:43,753
something, the easier it gets, right?

180
00:11:43,773 --> 00:11:47,736
There's strength in being part of a large group.

181
00:11:50,182 --> 00:11:58,704
But also, there are some concerns about people, different disciplines, can have very, very

182
00:11:58,764 --> 00:11:59,685
different experiences.

183
00:12:00,465 --> 00:12:05,646
An external contractor working in QA for a company that may be slightly above minimum

184
00:12:05,686 --> 00:12:11,068
wage, hopefully, is a very different experience to a very highly paid programmer.

185
00:12:11,728 --> 00:12:16,649
But if they are part of the same union, they're pulling or pushing in the same direction.

186
00:12:17,312 --> 00:12:18,452
And they can lift each other up.

187
00:12:19,133 --> 00:12:22,735
And it's very important to us that especially the roles that have,

188
00:12:22,895 --> 00:12:25,396
you know, are traditionally a little bit more pushed aside,

189
00:12:25,416 --> 00:12:32,560
are being empowered by the people who traditionally have a little bit more power and like

190
00:12:33,501 --> 00:12:35,902
bargaining room with the company.

191
00:12:36,262 --> 00:12:38,784
So that's why we, that's why I think recent initiatives

192
00:12:40,044 --> 00:12:43,867
all are starting out trying to go for as wide

193
00:12:46,493 --> 00:12:50,982
of a group of people working against as possible to get as

194
00:12:51,042 --> 00:12:56,473
much power to negotiate and to not leave anyone behind that has

195
00:12:56,554 --> 00:12:57,916
already traditionally been left behind.

196
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:17,235
Excellent. Next one comes from Joanna Thomas, who asks, will unions help the issues concerning lack of diversity in the games industry, including like harassment issues and hiring diversity issues.

197
00:13:17,255 --> 00:13:19,656
That's a good question. And

198
00:13:20,895 --> 00:13:26,078
I don't think it's a sad answer, but I think they can if they set out to do it, right?

199
00:13:26,098 --> 00:13:28,620
You know, there have been unions in the past.

200
00:13:28,680 --> 00:13:34,363
If you look at, let's say, early 1900s in America,

201
00:13:34,383 --> 00:13:37,966
there were no unions where unions were perpetuating white supremacy

202
00:13:38,006 --> 00:13:39,407
and didn't allow any black people to join,

203
00:13:40,047 --> 00:13:42,889
while still getting benefits for the white union members.

204
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,032
So there can definitely be a tool that sort of...

205
00:13:51,509 --> 00:13:56,792
Circles in a privileged group to give them more benefits while leaving other people out.

206
00:13:57,472 --> 00:14:06,357
But if you try to avoid it, if you try to push for a structure, for a union that actually plans to do

207
00:14:06,477 --> 00:14:12,700
and increase diversity and stuff, there's lots of things you can do. I'm looking for example at

208
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:17,342
a lot of the organization that has been happening in games writing.

209
00:14:19,470 --> 00:14:23,893
Vice or other places in the US were in the buy-in contract

210
00:14:23,953 --> 00:14:27,715
that pushed very hard to get the company to spend more money on diversity

211
00:14:27,835 --> 00:14:30,876
or have better reporting processes for sexual harassment.

212
00:14:31,577 --> 00:14:33,698
Or I think Singapore's vice media,

213
00:14:33,718 --> 00:14:37,300
where they especially pushed to give trans employees a better healthcare

214
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:37,980
because they usually have...

215
00:14:38,718 --> 00:14:41,299
higher medical needs than non-trans employees.

216
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:47,963
And if it's a goal that you set, it's a priority for the union as a whole, then I think it

217
00:14:47,983 --> 00:14:51,345
can be a very strong tool to achieve that.

218
00:14:53,467 --> 00:14:56,148
But they don't necessarily have to be.

219
00:14:56,528 --> 00:14:57,549
There are bad examples.

220
00:14:57,569 --> 00:15:03,953
A police union will not probably make the US police much more diverse and friendly.

221
00:15:05,260 --> 00:15:11,966
But it still gives this particular group of police officers a lot of power that maybe they shouldn't have.

222
00:15:11,986 --> 00:15:13,007
But it's a different discussion.

223
00:15:13,847 --> 00:15:18,091
But I think, yeah, unions are a tool to achieve something.

224
00:15:18,451 --> 00:15:22,835
And what you achieve with them really depends on how the union is made up and who's in it and who's not.

225
00:15:25,358 --> 00:15:28,221
Great. Moving on next one, getting some upvotes.

226
00:15:28,741 --> 00:15:31,703
One from Andrew Ross, who asks,

227
00:15:32,324 --> 00:15:36,366
what can press and players do to help workers unionize?

228
00:15:38,108 --> 00:15:38,948
That's interesting.

229
00:15:39,409 --> 00:15:42,191
So I think in recent years, since maybe 2017,

230
00:15:42,271 --> 00:15:46,274
we really started going and sort of to international gamers first,

231
00:15:46,614 --> 00:15:48,836
reporting on labor conditions, you know,

232
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:53,979
at Rockstar or Riot Games or other places.

233
00:15:53,999 --> 00:15:54,219
Yeah.

234
00:15:55,485 --> 00:16:03,312
And I think that's very good and supporting people know that, but to some degree, lots of people in the game industry do already know that.

235
00:16:05,274 --> 00:16:13,861
So it's really, so that really helps like bring these issues to the players, the people who play games, to be more informed.

236
00:16:14,041 --> 00:16:15,522
Now, I don't think that will sort of result.

237
00:16:16,496 --> 00:16:18,837
necessarily in like boycotts or anything like that.

238
00:16:18,917 --> 00:16:24,918
I don't think boycotts based on labour conditions are a viable strategy in this industry, but

239
00:16:24,958 --> 00:16:31,720
it helps raise awareness and particularly in this age of brands and branding, nobody

240
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:33,681
wants to be associated with a bad brand.

241
00:16:33,761 --> 00:16:40,883
So that can help, that awareness can push companies to do better, to preserve the brand

242
00:16:40,923 --> 00:16:41,143
image.

243
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:47,825
Translated into brand image goes directly to profit margins to some degree, right?

244
00:16:49,145 --> 00:16:50,485
So that is good.

245
00:16:52,686 --> 00:16:57,727
But it's also, I personally fear the idea that you just keep reporting month

246
00:16:57,747 --> 00:17:00,848
for month on this company is bad condition, this company is bad conditions

247
00:17:00,928 --> 00:17:05,409
and people will sort of just accept that as the baseline.

248
00:17:05,449 --> 00:17:06,409
And this should be expected.

249
00:17:06,949 --> 00:17:09,570
Like when you get to the point where people aren't surprised anymore

250
00:17:09,590 --> 00:17:12,290
that they are bad condition, they just sort of accepted them.

251
00:17:13,096 --> 00:17:14,597
Because that's the only thing they hear about.

252
00:17:14,637 --> 00:17:17,819
That might lead to sort of people getting numb to the problems.

253
00:17:18,499 --> 00:17:24,503
Which, that's why I think it's important to also not only sort of focus on the

254
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:30,467
problems, but sort of focus on the people who are trying to solve them.

255
00:17:30,667 --> 00:17:37,091
I very much enjoyed the reporting on the Riot Games walkout and the whole sort of

256
00:17:37,131 --> 00:17:38,472
movement and happening around that.

257
00:17:38,892 --> 00:17:41,754
And you can compare that one to one to, I think, five years earlier.

258
00:17:42,764 --> 00:17:49,426
2015, when there was a walkout at Crytek because Crytek, I think, in England, did not pay wages

259
00:17:49,706 --> 00:17:50,086
for a bit.

260
00:17:50,246 --> 00:17:51,646
So we just didn't shop to work.

261
00:17:52,306 --> 00:17:54,967
They walked out of Crytek because they weren't getting paid to work.

262
00:17:55,967 --> 00:17:58,448
And it was reporting sort of on that.

263
00:17:59,468 --> 00:18:03,869
But if you compare that reporting to reporting with the walkout at Riot Games, it's night

264
00:18:03,929 --> 00:18:07,210
and day on focus on the people doing the actual organizing on the ground.

265
00:18:08,807 --> 00:18:11,308
You might hear that in the background, something's going on here.

266
00:18:11,828 --> 00:18:17,332
But just setting a focus on the people affected and the people trying to help themselves,

267
00:18:17,352 --> 00:18:20,574
rather than just the issue of sort of, well, there is an issue that exists.

268
00:18:22,255 --> 00:18:22,915
End of article.

269
00:18:26,337 --> 00:18:26,477
Yeah.

270
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:31,970
Great. How about this one is interesting. It's from Gabe Pofker.

271
00:18:33,311 --> 00:18:39,855
What role can worker-owned cooperative studios play in supporting unions and unionization?

272
00:18:39,875 --> 00:18:41,175
Do you have any thoughts on that, Kevin?

273
00:18:43,196 --> 00:18:48,839
Yeah, I mean, I think work on cooperatives is, in my opinion,

274
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:52,922
for at least small-sized companies of the ideal form.

275
00:18:57,472 --> 00:19:00,794
I also don't think that in the next decade or two, everybody's

276
00:19:00,814 --> 00:19:03,175
going to switch to being a worker on cooperative. I don't

277
00:19:03,215 --> 00:19:07,237
see the worker on DA coming without a grander sort of

278
00:19:07,717 --> 00:19:12,059
cultural or labor revolution driving them towards that. So I

279
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:15,401
think that if you're starting out trying to form a new company,

280
00:19:16,061 --> 00:19:18,403
that it might be a very viable model you want to look at to a

281
00:19:22,573 --> 00:19:26,736
have a fairer company structure, but also be a more attractive company structure because

282
00:19:27,276 --> 00:19:32,078
getting direct part ownership of a company, part ownership of the profit, that makes people

283
00:19:32,118 --> 00:19:32,638
more invested.

284
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:36,900
And if people are more invested, I think they will do better work.

285
00:19:41,203 --> 00:19:46,805
But also, if you're in a very big company or an international company or a company,

286
00:19:47,266 --> 00:19:50,447
it's just too unwieldy to have everyone be a part owner.

287
00:19:51,132 --> 00:19:54,615
Then I think it's where a union would slot in with a collective bargaining agreement, right?

288
00:19:56,416 --> 00:20:03,641
Where the wider employees, the wider employeeship is part of the union that sets out

289
00:20:04,102 --> 00:20:08,505
or negotiates a collective bargaining agreement with the company that sets out

290
00:20:10,326 --> 00:20:14,149
working conditions, reimbursements, bonus pay, and that kind of stuff

291
00:20:15,050 --> 00:20:16,451
for everybody working at the company.

292
00:20:19,412 --> 00:20:24,936
So, and sort of applies for everybody, slightly depending on which country, but

293
00:20:25,336 --> 00:20:28,858
rectifying agreements can just apply to everybody working at a location,

294
00:20:30,179 --> 00:20:31,961
and even new people joining and that kind of stuff.

295
00:20:33,241 --> 00:20:36,364
I remember talking once to the owner of a small indie company, he said like,

296
00:20:36,384 --> 00:20:40,447
you're talking about like, yeah, what happens if your product,

297
00:20:40,467 --> 00:20:43,489
your small product just blows up and becomes hyper successful?

298
00:20:44,790 --> 00:20:48,733
How much if a small company is just, you know, based on gentleman's agreements?

299
00:20:49,606 --> 00:20:53,048
And sort of vacant ascending said, things should be fine.

300
00:20:53,968 --> 00:20:57,370
But you know, you saw a million dollars at any group of people.

301
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:02,492
And you know, these sort of gentlemen, nice, nice social

302
00:21:02,512 --> 00:21:04,653
rules and regulations start breaking down.

303
00:21:04,673 --> 00:21:10,235
So, so I said to him that maybe he wants to just

304
00:21:11,178 --> 00:21:13,538
It might be a benefit in having a union with a collective bargaining agreement

305
00:21:14,058 --> 00:21:18,159
because A, now the union can worry about making sure people are happy and he

306
00:21:18,239 --> 00:21:21,079
doesn't have to worry as much about making sure people are happy and figuring

307
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:24,640
out what their issues are, the union will do that for him and negotiate with him

308
00:21:24,740 --> 00:21:25,860
to make sure people get what they want.

309
00:21:28,041 --> 00:21:32,621
But also if the collective bargaining agreement contains rules about, hey,

310
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:38,883
profit shares or things like that, that the people, that the employees discuss

311
00:21:38,903 --> 00:21:40,503
themselves and worked out the bargain for.

312
00:21:41,182 --> 00:21:47,287
That sort of means that the employees will feel like that

313
00:21:47,307 --> 00:21:50,210
is sort of fair and a feeling of fairness that you have if

314
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,173
you're part of a work on cooperative, cooperative can

315
00:21:53,193 --> 00:21:57,757
software replicated by adding these sorts of things into a

316
00:21:57,777 --> 00:21:59,478
collectifying agreement of the company as a whole.

317
00:22:02,697 --> 00:22:21,026
Great. Tobias Eisner asks, as the industry is quite global and unions usually are bound to national laws, how could this problem be addressed for our industry, creating one international standard and avoiding the fragmentation as it is common in other industries?

318
00:22:21,126 --> 00:22:26,809
So how can this be more of an international movement and not be fragmented?

319
00:22:28,283 --> 00:22:33,765
So I go point, there are some few unions that try to operate entirely globally.

320
00:22:34,666 --> 00:22:39,428
Uh, international workers of the world, the AWW is one that tries to do that.

321
00:22:39,508 --> 00:22:43,870
But you know, as a person said in specific countries, you've got specific

322
00:22:43,910 --> 00:22:47,151
labor laws and you need to incorporate in specific things, probably membership

323
00:22:47,231 --> 00:22:48,972
and probably membership currency are split.

324
00:22:49,052 --> 00:22:54,855
So, uh, uh, it's not really like one entirely global organization, but they

325
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:56,956
try as much as they can to push towards that.

326
00:22:58,247 --> 00:22:59,848
Which I think is an interesting idea.

327
00:23:00,028 --> 00:23:00,769
But, um...

328
00:23:03,330 --> 00:23:03,530
Um...

329
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,372
I've already spoken a lot about, like,

330
00:23:06,532 --> 00:23:08,033
how we think about unions often as...

331
00:23:08,754 --> 00:23:09,754
If an industry is global,

332
00:23:09,874 --> 00:23:12,116
and we think of unions often as also global

333
00:23:12,276 --> 00:23:13,377
or maybe national.

334
00:23:13,397 --> 00:23:15,958
It's entirely possible to have a union for

335
00:23:15,978 --> 00:23:16,939
a company of

336
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:20,201
20 people in the UK.

337
00:23:20,281 --> 00:23:21,902
A union is just for that one company.

338
00:23:22,443 --> 00:23:23,763
And we're always about that one company.

339
00:23:24,544 --> 00:23:25,685
Um...

340
00:23:25,985 --> 00:23:27,346
Lots of unions now spring up.

341
00:23:28,681 --> 00:23:33,443
Back in the day, where like particular companies or, you know, miners in one mine had issues.

342
00:23:33,983 --> 00:23:37,345
So they unionized to make the issues at that mine be better.

343
00:23:37,745 --> 00:23:44,708
And I think on that level, you maybe don't need to worry about the international, you

344
00:23:44,728 --> 00:23:47,329
can just worry about your own particular issues at the workplace.

345
00:23:47,829 --> 00:23:55,912
But of course, in this globalized economy, there's the threat of outsourcing or, you

346
00:23:55,952 --> 00:23:56,072
know.

347
00:23:57,342 --> 00:24:02,625
If you're part of a big international company, then they might decide to shut that location

348
00:24:02,665 --> 00:24:07,308
down and outsource it somewhere else as a threat that a lot of people have.

349
00:24:08,309 --> 00:24:13,212
Or if you push too far, if you demand too much, you might just make the whole thing

350
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:13,732
go away.

351
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:24,520
To which I say, well, nobody opens up an office building in San Francisco and hires highly

352
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:25,520
paid engineers.

353
00:24:27,164 --> 00:24:30,845
to then immediately throw the whole thing away once they start demanding a little bit more.

354
00:24:31,506 --> 00:24:34,527
Maybe start demanding a little bit more for the people who aren't as highly paid as they are.

355
00:24:37,968 --> 00:24:42,369
But I've been going around Europe a bit in the recent couple of years,

356
00:24:42,409 --> 00:24:47,311
being to unions in Sweden, Denmark, France, Finland.

357
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:51,512
And I remember I was talking to

358
00:24:52,707 --> 00:24:56,909
I'm a member of Unionen, which is sort of the biggest Swedish union as a whole.

359
00:24:57,489 --> 00:25:01,230
And Sweden being a very unionist country in general, big union membership.

360
00:25:01,671 --> 00:25:05,152
And it's starting to make me think that they have enough money in their wall chest so that

361
00:25:05,252 --> 00:25:11,414
every single member of the union could go on strike for multiple years and not get paid

362
00:25:11,554 --> 00:25:11,975
anything.

363
00:25:12,495 --> 00:25:17,557
They have their wall chest that allows them to have a lot of bargaining power because

364
00:25:17,577 --> 00:25:20,418
they can literally strike for forever, essentially.

365
00:25:22,447 --> 00:25:26,248
versus we, as a very new union, we do not have a watch that big

366
00:25:26,268 --> 00:25:32,370
where you can pay everybody salaries in full for years. But

367
00:25:32,770 --> 00:25:37,732
again, going slightly back to the Riot Games walkout, you know,

368
00:25:38,352 --> 00:25:43,214
did see the solidarity of people working at other locations. And

369
00:25:43,234 --> 00:25:48,036
I think in Dublin, in Ireland, there was also a walkout by

370
00:25:48,076 --> 00:25:50,737
people, but they are on solidarity. And

371
00:25:51,533 --> 00:25:55,994
And I think in this more globally connected world, it's much easier for struggles in one

372
00:25:56,014 --> 00:26:01,215
region or one arm of the company to reach people working in other regions or other parts

373
00:26:01,255 --> 00:26:05,196
of a company and to have solidarity action across the globe.

374
00:26:06,436 --> 00:26:11,037
It's much easier than it was, you know, before the digital age.

375
00:26:11,677 --> 00:26:15,558
So I think there's definitely possibilities to coordinate and cooperate across borders.

376
00:26:17,445 --> 00:26:19,527
And again, just as we said, okay, we want to get as much

377
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:22,949
different people inside of a union. So the more privileged

378
00:26:22,969 --> 00:26:25,511
people that can help the less privileged people, whatever the

379
00:26:25,691 --> 00:26:29,394
particular privilege may be. Same is true for cross borders.

380
00:26:30,195 --> 00:26:33,657
If multiple unions across borders of a company cooperate,

381
00:26:34,318 --> 00:26:37,120
then if the highly paid engineers in San Francisco can

382
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:40,462
send them solidarity with them, maybe definitely not as highly

383
00:26:40,542 --> 00:26:43,284
paid QA testers in India.

384
00:26:45,421 --> 00:26:49,618
That very much can help with bargaining power and improving the situation.

385
00:26:50,990 --> 00:26:54,390
Great. All right, we have about two minutes left. Let's try to get two more in.

386
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:57,331
There's one from, just came in from Ryan Lippert.

387
00:26:59,172 --> 00:27:01,872
What, if anything, could I do between now

388
00:27:02,152 --> 00:27:07,614
and when this person graduates law school shortly? What can they do

389
00:27:08,014 --> 00:27:11,254
between now and then to get some relevant experience in this area?

390
00:27:11,654 --> 00:27:15,215
And are there any specific reading recommendations this person's interested

391
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:17,436
in getting into this subject?

392
00:27:19,633 --> 00:27:24,335
Hmm, reading recommendations and law school. I just assumed from

393
00:27:24,355 --> 00:27:30,557
the term law school that it's about us. In which case, what

394
00:27:30,617 --> 00:27:35,659
you should do as a lawyer in the US sort of outside of my, my

395
00:27:35,739 --> 00:27:37,720
knowledge, but when it comes to sort of general reading

396
00:27:37,760 --> 00:27:46,824
recommendations. And now we can show a book in camera. Secret.

397
00:27:46,984 --> 00:27:47,564
Nope.

398
00:27:50,801 --> 00:27:53,262
I think it's a successful organizer by labor notes.

399
00:27:54,643 --> 00:27:58,765
This book that sort of lays out okay, how do I approach how to

400
00:27:58,785 --> 00:28:01,126
approach organizing my workplace? I'll sort of start

401
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:04,488
to finish what I think to look out for what are you know,

402
00:28:04,508 --> 00:28:06,869
things that organizers have learned over the decades of

403
00:28:06,929 --> 00:28:12,392
organizing. And this book as well as like other books by

404
00:28:12,432 --> 00:28:17,354
labor notes are very good resources about organizing. When

405
00:28:17,374 --> 00:28:19,055
it comes to legal resources, well, I guess.

406
00:28:20,538 --> 00:28:24,118
Become familiar with the National Labor Relationship Act.

407
00:28:25,459 --> 00:28:28,999
As I said in the beginning, that's sort of outside of my realm of knowledge.

408
00:28:29,119 --> 00:28:33,640
I think that's probably all they need. They want a little resource. And then we'll go over where

409
00:28:33,680 --> 00:28:43,602
you can find Kevin and his organization online. Let's try to get this one in. Gabriel Mikl,

410
00:28:43,642 --> 00:28:47,763
sorry, pronunciation. I don't have the temperament to organize or lead a union.

411
00:28:48,217 --> 00:28:49,799
However, I would like to join one.

412
00:28:49,939 --> 00:28:54,062
Am I doomed to a unionless country if most everyone is like me?

413
00:28:54,643 --> 00:28:56,745
Uh, what can I do to still contribute?

414
00:28:58,646 --> 00:28:59,547
Unionist country.

415
00:28:59,607 --> 00:29:04,211
I would say there's no country that is entirely unionist.

416
00:29:04,431 --> 00:29:07,794
If you want to join a union, there's only one in your country that would accept you.

417
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:11,317
And it could maybe help you get started on doing more.

418
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:14,140
But you know, in general, if it's a union, you can join.

419
00:29:15,395 --> 00:29:18,098
You know, money does definitely help people to do stuff.

420
00:29:19,239 --> 00:29:24,283
I know that very much as a treasurer, having money allows, you know, allows us to take on pro bono cases.

421
00:29:24,343 --> 00:29:26,705
I work with lawyers and do all kinds of stuff.

422
00:29:27,306 --> 00:29:32,951
So, just, you know, joining a union and paying the membership fees will definitely help them.

423
00:29:35,227 --> 00:29:39,090
If everybody thinks like that, I think that's something that's

424
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:42,673
definitely changing across the industry. More and more people

425
00:29:42,753 --> 00:29:45,676
are firstly becoming aware of unionization and be becoming

426
00:29:45,716 --> 00:29:48,899
positive unionization. And I think as the decade will go on,

427
00:29:48,919 --> 00:29:54,384
you will see a huge shift in public industry opinion about

428
00:29:54,404 --> 00:29:54,924
unionization.

429
00:29:54,944 --> 00:29:57,126
All right, great.

430
00:29:58,005 --> 00:29:59,726
Kevin, thank you so much for joining us.

431
00:30:00,426 --> 00:30:04,008
It's been really insightful for me as well.

432
00:30:04,408 --> 00:30:06,349
Thank you to everyone who showed up

433
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:07,850
and asked these great questions.

434
00:30:08,290 --> 00:30:13,212
If people want to contact you or GW UK for more info,

435
00:30:13,472 --> 00:30:14,733
what's the best way to do it, Kevin?

436
00:30:16,654 --> 00:30:20,776
I think the GCScription has a Twitter handle.

437
00:30:21,036 --> 00:30:25,358
Yeah, yeah, check out the description down there.

438
00:30:25,896 --> 00:30:33,177
Yeah, so I might like sort of speak about my Twitter handle or, you know, just googling my name.

439
00:30:33,197 --> 00:30:38,558
It's kind of a unique name apparently, so you'll probably find me. When it comes to, like,

440
00:30:38,598 --> 00:30:44,119
contacting us, I used to again say, we've got local meetings over the country, come to one,

441
00:30:44,219 --> 00:30:50,121
but not during corona. So, now go to our website and you can contact us there, or, you know, hit

442
00:30:50,201 --> 00:30:55,642
up the GameXplain UK Twitter. Yeah, no, anywhere you want.

443
00:30:56,676 --> 00:31:05,078
Yeah, all right. Great SEO. So thanks again and I'll see you all around. Thanks. Bye.
