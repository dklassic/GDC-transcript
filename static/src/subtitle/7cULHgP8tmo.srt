1
00:00:04,614 --> 00:00:05,355
Okay, hi everybody.

2
00:00:07,596 --> 00:00:08,276
I'm thrilled to be here.

3
00:00:09,097 --> 00:00:11,158
I, uh, actually, I'm kind of honored to be here

4
00:00:11,198 --> 00:00:13,679
because I'm totally honored to be here.

5
00:00:13,899 --> 00:00:16,180
I never in a million years would have expected,

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:20,103
uh, that 20 years ago when we made Myst,

7
00:00:20,463 --> 00:00:25,245
um, anybody would be interested in it 20 years later.

8
00:00:25,886 --> 00:00:27,587
So this is pretty incredible.

9
00:00:28,587 --> 00:00:32,169
Um, so, um, I get started.

10
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:34,390
Thank you all for coming.

11
00:00:38,556 --> 00:00:39,477
It makes me feel old.

12
00:00:40,437 --> 00:00:41,038
Postmortem.

13
00:00:41,058 --> 00:00:42,359
This is what a name.

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:48,183
I want to go back to a little earlier than NIST.

15
00:00:48,804 --> 00:00:48,924
Um...

16
00:00:52,927 --> 00:00:53,227
In 1984, when...

17
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:56,730
1984 was just a little bit after the Mac was created.

18
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,231
So it was four years later.

19
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:06,332
and Rand and I were in different places.

20
00:01:06,412 --> 00:01:08,393
Rand was in Texas, my brother,

21
00:01:09,113 --> 00:01:13,495
and I should say that Rand Miller,

22
00:01:14,036 --> 00:01:15,617
my brother, and I'm Robin Miller,

23
00:01:16,797 --> 00:01:18,178
and we were the guys who made Myst,

24
00:01:18,258 --> 00:01:19,519
just in case anybody was here.

25
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:25,202
Wow.

26
00:01:28,344 --> 00:01:32,106
I just like had this feeling inside me of just

27
00:01:32,206 --> 00:01:33,006
utter confidence.

28
00:01:33,266 --> 00:01:33,447
Wow.

29
00:01:35,194 --> 00:01:36,434
I want to bring you home with me now.

30
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:43,920
In 1988, Rand was in Texas, I was in Washington State,

31
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,261
and he called me and said,

32
00:01:46,301 --> 00:01:48,743
I've got this idea for this interactive storybook.

33
00:01:50,304 --> 00:01:52,326
I, like, wasn't interested really in this,

34
00:01:52,386 --> 00:01:53,987
but he was really into computers,

35
00:01:54,707 --> 00:01:55,528
I kind of wasn't.

36
00:01:55,588 --> 00:01:56,889
I didn't have a computer, in fact.

37
00:01:57,669 --> 00:02:00,091
He wanted to send me this thing called HyperCard,

38
00:02:00,451 --> 00:02:00,912
which he did.

39
00:02:02,071 --> 00:02:04,432
And I went into my parents' basement.

40
00:02:05,032 --> 00:02:06,653
They had a computer in their basement.

41
00:02:07,314 --> 00:02:10,615
And I started working on, I started drawing a manhole cover.

42
00:02:10,655 --> 00:02:12,556
That was like part, the first part of the story.

43
00:02:12,576 --> 00:02:14,017
I don't know why I drew a manhole cover.

44
00:02:14,977 --> 00:02:17,838
And I continued drawing a linear story.

45
00:02:18,499 --> 00:02:19,759
I drew the manhole cover open.

46
00:02:20,139 --> 00:02:24,622
And I just like continued drawing sequentially

47
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:25,982
this storybook.

48
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:31,365
But I got to this vine growing out of the manhole.

49
00:02:32,377 --> 00:02:35,520
And I didn't know what I wanted to do at that point.

50
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:39,423
I didn't know if I wanted to go up the vine or down into the manhole.

51
00:02:39,623 --> 00:02:45,509
And from there, it just, the medium itself became non-linear.

52
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,496
And it's as if the medium was calling out to be non-linear.

53
00:02:53,516 --> 00:02:59,041
It was not, it was not something that we really invented.

54
00:02:59,614 --> 00:03:02,476
at that point in time, or really were trying to do,

55
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,016
it was just...

56
00:03:04,917 --> 00:03:06,178
it just happened on its own.

57
00:03:07,199 --> 00:03:08,359
So that was the manhole in 1988.

58
00:03:11,121 --> 00:03:13,742
And then we continued making these games

59
00:03:13,762 --> 00:03:17,084
that had all the same qualities, one after the other.

60
00:03:17,745 --> 00:03:19,866
And you saw that last... those screens before,

61
00:03:19,886 --> 00:03:20,886
they were black and white.

62
00:03:22,387 --> 00:03:23,688
Totally, totally simple.

63
00:03:23,708 --> 00:03:25,509
There were a lot of kids' games, and they...

64
00:03:29,575 --> 00:03:32,236
Point and click, first person point of view.

65
00:03:34,137 --> 00:03:36,017
And the player as the main character.

66
00:03:36,658 --> 00:03:38,478
You didn't have an avatar or anything like that.

67
00:03:38,538 --> 00:03:40,299
You just sort of were in the world,

68
00:03:41,219 --> 00:03:44,721
and you were the person in that world wandering around.

69
00:03:46,441 --> 00:03:50,083
You also had this quality of everything being explorable.

70
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,003
In the manhole, not so much.

71
00:03:52,844 --> 00:03:55,685
But then later on,

72
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:58,326
we kind of realized as we would watch people play...

73
00:03:58,796 --> 00:04:05,019
that people would see a door and they would definitely want to go through that door.

74
00:04:05,059 --> 00:04:09,942
But if people saw something like a forest in the distance, well, they wanted to go to that forest.

75
00:04:10,022 --> 00:04:15,245
If people saw, no matter what it was, a drawer, anything,

76
00:04:15,925 --> 00:04:18,967
they wanted to be able to explore the entire world.

77
00:04:20,708 --> 00:04:22,889
They didn't want any boundaries to that world.

78
00:04:22,949 --> 00:04:28,072
And so we attempted as much as possible to create no boundaries.

79
00:04:28,392 --> 00:04:28,572
Now...

80
00:04:29,397 --> 00:04:33,861
Nowadays, almost every game is, they're just mammoth.

81
00:04:34,461 --> 00:04:35,862
They pretty much have no boundaries.

82
00:04:35,922 --> 00:04:37,043
Back then, it was a little different.

83
00:04:39,045 --> 00:04:45,530
We got to a point around 1990 where we had this idea that,

84
00:04:45,630 --> 00:04:48,632
hey, let's make one of these worlds for grown-ups,

85
00:04:49,753 --> 00:04:50,753
for an older audience.

86
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:55,117
And we wanted to add something a little bit more like a story,

87
00:04:55,137 --> 00:04:56,758
a non-linear story.

88
00:04:59,745 --> 00:05:03,246
And we wanted to make the player like a protagonist.

89
00:05:03,607 --> 00:05:05,227
We wanted believable characters.

90
00:05:06,848 --> 00:05:10,430
And we wanted the player as the protagonist

91
00:05:10,470 --> 00:05:12,410
to make some sort of ethical choice

92
00:05:13,291 --> 00:05:14,712
between right and wrong.

93
00:05:14,752 --> 00:05:17,533
We thought that would really create

94
00:05:17,593 --> 00:05:19,113
an interesting story of some sort.

95
00:05:19,554 --> 00:05:22,135
There'd be an emotional provocation.

96
00:05:22,475 --> 00:05:25,816
So we created the Grey Summons.

97
00:05:26,619 --> 00:05:30,481
we created the idea of the Grey Summons and we proposed it to Activision

98
00:05:31,242 --> 00:05:32,643
and uh... Activision

99
00:05:33,383 --> 00:05:34,624
told us to stick to children's games

100
00:05:37,526 --> 00:05:38,347
which really uh...

101
00:05:40,008 --> 00:05:40,469
was

102
00:05:41,129 --> 00:05:41,609
disheartening

103
00:05:43,151 --> 00:05:45,452
we were not doing very well at that point in time

104
00:05:46,853 --> 00:05:47,013
uh...

105
00:05:48,214 --> 00:05:52,137
and so I mean and we were really not doing very well we were eating and I'm

106
00:05:52,417 --> 00:05:53,118
not exaggerating

107
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:58,203
We were eating rice and beans and government cheese, and that's like, that was our diet.

108
00:05:58,423 --> 00:05:59,444
We were probably very healthy.

109
00:06:00,805 --> 00:06:04,087
A lot more healthy than I am today.

110
00:06:04,768 --> 00:06:11,152
But this was, I mean, this was the end of, potentially the end of our career in gaming.

111
00:06:13,934 --> 00:06:19,098
And I think, though, as a matter of fact, I know, we had learned so much, we had gleaned

112
00:06:19,138 --> 00:06:21,019
so much from what we had done up to that point.

113
00:06:22,134 --> 00:06:25,016
everything we had done in those earlier products,

114
00:06:25,056 --> 00:06:30,200
we took and we folded into what became Myst,

115
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,482
which I'll talk about in just a little bit.

116
00:06:34,323 --> 00:06:36,205
It was almost at that exact point,

117
00:06:36,285 --> 00:06:40,448
or a little afterwards, that Sunsoft of Japan

118
00:06:41,228 --> 00:06:42,009
came to us and said,

119
00:06:42,049 --> 00:06:43,450
hey, we've got this great idea.

120
00:06:43,470 --> 00:06:49,735
We would like you to make a game for an older audience.

121
00:06:51,829 --> 00:06:54,511
Just like, you know, you've been doing, except not for kids, okay?

122
00:06:54,531 --> 00:06:56,133
Because we don't want you to do that anymore.

123
00:06:56,433 --> 00:07:00,757
We want you to make something, but for, you know, like, everybody else.

124
00:07:01,518 --> 00:07:06,002
And so, it was, it blew our minds, and we were on board totally.

125
00:07:06,462 --> 00:07:11,227
We just had no idea, you know, what to do in terms of that.

126
00:07:11,267 --> 00:07:15,010
It was 1991. I'm just, like, giving you a sense of what time this was, okay?

127
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,420
This guy was around. This was, like, the, one of the most popular movies of the year.

128
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:24,841
These were cell phones, and we couldn't afford them.

129
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:29,261
And this was the internet, and we couldn't afford it.

130
00:07:31,542 --> 00:07:36,883
So we didn't know at all what to do in terms of our game.

131
00:07:37,663 --> 00:07:41,243
But we knew what we, we kind of knew what we wanted it to be.

132
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:45,264
At that point was a nonlinear story again.

133
00:07:46,395 --> 00:07:47,496
believable characters.

134
00:07:48,056 --> 00:07:49,576
We wanted advanced graphics.

135
00:07:50,937 --> 00:07:52,938
Much more advanced graphics than we had been doing.

136
00:07:53,418 --> 00:07:54,918
We didn't know what that meant at all.

137
00:07:56,259 --> 00:07:56,479
Um...

138
00:07:58,880 --> 00:08:02,501
In fact, we thought we would probably be

139
00:08:03,321 --> 00:08:04,442
hand-drawing the graphics.

140
00:08:05,542 --> 00:08:07,863
So Myst, for a while at that point,

141
00:08:08,043 --> 00:08:09,284
was gonna be all hand-drawn.

142
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:10,744
Um...

143
00:08:11,905 --> 00:08:15,386
And it was intimidating to, like, think.

144
00:08:15,841 --> 00:08:16,842
OK, we're gonna make this game.

145
00:08:17,302 --> 00:08:18,883
It's gonna be really advanced graphics,

146
00:08:18,923 --> 00:08:20,804
but we're gonna have to draw it all.

147
00:08:22,245 --> 00:08:24,446
In, you know, how, what would that mean?

148
00:08:25,606 --> 00:08:27,628
And some sort of puzzles.

149
00:08:28,388 --> 00:08:30,669
We didn't, what would the puzzles be?

150
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:33,191
And then again, some sort of ethical choice.

151
00:08:33,391 --> 00:08:34,952
That was really intimidating.

152
00:08:35,012 --> 00:08:36,793
What would this ethical choice be?

153
00:08:37,413 --> 00:08:38,954
Mystery. We knew, OK, yeah.

154
00:08:39,374 --> 00:08:40,134
It's gonna be a mystery.

155
00:08:43,717 --> 00:08:48,460
just to go through some inspirations that were behind Myst,

156
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:50,442
D&D.

157
00:08:52,083 --> 00:08:55,586
Growing up, our brother, not Rand, not me,

158
00:08:56,206 --> 00:08:58,028
but our other brother played a lot of D&D.

159
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:01,811
And so we were kind of surrounded by that a bit.

160
00:09:03,752 --> 00:09:06,454
He would get all of his friends together at least once a week.

161
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:12,830
they would sit and play it. And so, Ran and I were able to observe, when there's a really

162
00:09:12,870 --> 00:09:20,091
good dungeon master, you get this thing where it's like, you know, a great story can happen.

163
00:09:20,812 --> 00:09:31,094
It's creative. It's fun. It can be a blast. And maybe not so much with a bad dungeon master,

164
00:09:31,714 --> 00:09:37,256
but, you know, it can be a really cool and adventuresome and exploratory, you know,

165
00:09:38,622 --> 00:09:46,386
cool thing. In fact, Rand created his own dungeon at one point in time. He wanted to

166
00:09:46,426 --> 00:09:52,009
do that. And what he threw out was rolling to create your characters and rolling for

167
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:58,832
your dexterity, rolling for your strength, rolling for these other aspects of your character.

168
00:09:59,092 --> 00:10:01,874
And he said, okay, you guys are going to play this and you're just going to be yourselves.

169
00:10:02,554 --> 00:10:05,816
Use your own intelligence and just observe within this universe.

170
00:10:06,827 --> 00:10:09,969
And in fact, he never used dice at all.

171
00:10:10,690 --> 00:10:13,032
He just told people what they saw within that universe.

172
00:10:13,572 --> 00:10:15,273
If you look, there's one drawing over here.

173
00:10:17,415 --> 00:10:19,917
And it's Ran's dungeon.

174
00:10:21,218 --> 00:10:22,239
A drawing from Ran's dungeon.

175
00:10:22,279 --> 00:10:23,340
When we were creating Myst,

176
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,742
we got to the very last age we were designing.

177
00:10:26,762 --> 00:10:29,324
It was the Mechanical Age.

178
00:10:30,165 --> 00:10:31,786
And if you notice a similarity...

179
00:10:33,538 --> 00:10:36,399
It's, we used this as a part of the design.

180
00:10:36,599 --> 00:10:38,860
We kind of like, what are we going to do for this last age?

181
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:41,441
Oh, let's get out that old dungeon you designed, Rand.

182
00:10:46,323 --> 00:10:46,603
Zork.

183
00:10:47,964 --> 00:10:49,885
We, we had played Zork.

184
00:10:49,945 --> 00:10:51,125
Rand had played both the Zorks.

185
00:10:51,826 --> 00:10:55,407
There was, there was all kinds of other video games before Myst, obviously, but...

186
00:10:56,279 --> 00:11:00,239
We hadn't had a lot of experience with those other video games.

187
00:11:00,699 --> 00:11:02,220
We had played those Zork games.

188
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:06,200
And I had played like half of Zork 2.

189
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,781
It was incredibly cool.

190
00:11:08,881 --> 00:11:10,201
Rand had played both of them.

191
00:11:10,281 --> 00:11:12,582
And they were definitely an inspiration for us.

192
00:11:13,682 --> 00:11:15,262
Because they were these non-linear worlds.

193
00:11:15,662 --> 00:11:15,942
So...

194
00:11:18,063 --> 00:11:19,983
I'm just going to quickly go through, you know,

195
00:11:20,423 --> 00:11:21,583
Star Wars, of course.

196
00:11:23,584 --> 00:11:24,524
The world there.

197
00:11:25,894 --> 00:11:31,016
from a very early time, it was the myth behind that universe

198
00:11:33,716 --> 00:11:35,637
was deeply inspirational.

199
00:11:37,357 --> 00:11:39,678
Portals to other universes,

200
00:11:43,899 --> 00:11:47,280
we took almost directly from the Chronic Zinarnia.

201
00:11:47,380 --> 00:11:52,302
And then Jules Verne, the idea of an island.

202
00:11:53,043 --> 00:11:55,805
we took from Mysterious Island and then just old books.

203
00:11:56,545 --> 00:12:00,246
You know, we kind of stole that idea.

204
00:12:00,266 --> 00:12:04,228
You know, we stole a lot of things, in a way.

205
00:12:04,288 --> 00:12:07,209
I don't know if all creativity is kind of stealing in a sense.

206
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,410
Okay, pre-production.

207
00:12:11,191 --> 00:12:12,791
I don't know where we got the idea for Two Brothers.

208
00:12:16,813 --> 00:12:19,334
It had to be subconscious on some sense, on some level.

209
00:12:21,075 --> 00:12:21,215
Um...

210
00:12:22,282 --> 00:12:23,602
But we went with two brothers.

211
00:12:24,482 --> 00:12:25,583
Oh, this is interesting.

212
00:12:25,603 --> 00:12:28,784
Oh, when Sunsoft came to us, they said, look,

213
00:12:29,884 --> 00:12:32,725
what we're going with is game machines.

214
00:12:33,645 --> 00:12:34,566
That's what we want, guys.

215
00:12:34,606 --> 00:12:36,486
You take everything else.

216
00:12:37,146 --> 00:12:39,527
We don't want all the PC stuff.

217
00:12:39,547 --> 00:12:40,388
That's not valuable.

218
00:12:40,908 --> 00:12:42,648
What we think is valuable is game machines.

219
00:12:42,708 --> 00:12:44,069
So it's like, great.

220
00:12:44,169 --> 00:12:46,149
We got all the PC stuff.

221
00:12:46,189 --> 00:12:47,250
And they went with game machines.

222
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:50,731
But game machines, at that time, had no hard drive buffer.

223
00:12:51,228 --> 00:12:52,509
and very small memory buffer.

224
00:12:53,109 --> 00:12:54,969
So we had to design around that for Mist.

225
00:12:57,029 --> 00:13:00,210
That was an interesting design restriction.

226
00:13:01,030 --> 00:13:03,171
So how do we design around that?

227
00:13:03,251 --> 00:13:06,471
We had to load different pieces of Mist.

228
00:13:10,312 --> 00:13:12,232
We had to compartmentalize Mist,

229
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,793
which we did by making creating ages.

230
00:13:18,413 --> 00:13:20,073
This works really well for design.

231
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:24,814
Probably a lot of game makers have discovered this along the way.

232
00:13:24,834 --> 00:13:29,015
A lot of designers have discovered this along the way as well.

233
00:13:29,075 --> 00:13:32,437
Just to fit pieces of a thing in your mind,

234
00:13:32,457 --> 00:13:34,237
to know there's one central place.

235
00:13:35,698 --> 00:13:37,919
If you think of wandering around Disneyland,

236
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:40,520
you always know there's that central location.

237
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:44,481
And then you go out to all these different areas

238
00:13:44,761 --> 00:13:46,122
and you always feel like, yeah, OK.

239
00:13:46,722 --> 00:13:49,043
I can always, no matter what, if I get lost...

240
00:13:50,194 --> 00:13:51,875
I can always go back to that central location.

241
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,875
In fact, we had on an earlier product

242
00:13:55,916 --> 00:13:56,656
that we had done,

243
00:13:58,316 --> 00:13:59,357
done the same exact thing.

244
00:13:59,377 --> 00:14:01,838
We'd had this ship, went around to all these planets.

245
00:14:01,858 --> 00:14:04,338
You can always very easily get back to that central ship.

246
00:14:05,919 --> 00:14:07,519
So we were kind of used to that idea.

247
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:09,800
But I'm not...

248
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:11,540
I don't know if we would have done that on Myst

249
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,761
had there not been that memory restriction.

250
00:14:15,021 --> 00:14:16,262
It was something that we did,

251
00:14:16,342 --> 00:14:17,422
and it worked out really well.

252
00:14:21,098 --> 00:14:26,082
Puzzles. I actually hadn't put this part into my presentation

253
00:14:26,142 --> 00:14:29,365
until last night. I was in an interview and somebody asked me,

254
00:14:29,385 --> 00:14:32,387
oh, how'd you come up with puzzles? Completely forgot about it.

255
00:14:36,591 --> 00:14:40,834
We had an idea when we created Myst that most people don't like puzzles.

256
00:14:43,516 --> 00:14:46,899
Gamers love puzzles. But we weren't creating Myst for gamers.

257
00:14:47,559 --> 00:14:50,581
We were creating the game for, essentially, non-gamers.

258
00:14:52,998 --> 00:14:55,620
And non-gamers don't like puzzles.

259
00:14:56,980 --> 00:15:00,302
So a good puzzle shouldn't feel like a puzzle.

260
00:15:00,802 --> 00:15:05,684
It should feel very familiar and not arbitrary.

261
00:15:06,525 --> 00:15:08,826
It should have a sense that it's just a part of the world

262
00:15:10,006 --> 00:15:13,168
and that it's just something you're just figuring out

263
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:16,629
because it's, you know, it's like a throne breaker in your house.

264
00:15:16,689 --> 00:15:18,570
You know, what happens when the electricity goes out?

265
00:15:18,590 --> 00:15:19,931
Well, you go and...

266
00:15:21,362 --> 00:15:23,563
you know, you switch the breaker back on.

267
00:15:24,023 --> 00:15:27,584
And so we kind of did that as much as possible in Myst.

268
00:15:27,884 --> 00:15:29,544
Now, we created some bad puzzles in Myst,

269
00:15:30,425 --> 00:15:31,745
but we also made some good ones.

270
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:34,906
And so to a certain extent,

271
00:15:35,006 --> 00:15:37,427
I think Myst works because of that.

272
00:15:38,547 --> 00:15:40,387
In fact, we made some really bad puzzles in Myst.

273
00:15:40,427 --> 00:15:42,448
There's one or two that just are, that suck.

274
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,461
But there's some that are pretty good.

275
00:15:47,242 --> 00:15:48,783
So you solve a good puzzle.

276
00:15:48,923 --> 00:15:50,223
You're able to solve a good puzzle

277
00:15:50,424 --> 00:15:53,225
with just observation and basic common sense.

278
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,928
So here's an arbitrary puzzle that we did in Myst.

279
00:16:00,449 --> 00:16:00,869
Not good.

280
00:16:03,071 --> 00:16:06,052
This one is not arbitrary at all.

281
00:16:06,433 --> 00:16:07,993
And if you remembered, if you played Myst...

282
00:16:09,034 --> 00:16:13,756
It was just the windmill that pumps water up from the sea,

283
00:16:13,836 --> 00:16:16,298
and you've got this container full of water,

284
00:16:16,318 --> 00:16:18,579
and then there's the water pressure that powers everything on the island.

285
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,220
It's really just...

286
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:22,521
Maybe it doesn't feel like a puzzle at all.

287
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:25,323
It just feels like you're trying to power stuff on the island.

288
00:16:27,444 --> 00:16:30,146
And then you've got this puzzle where you're just trying to...

289
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:32,927
You've got a chest at the bottom of this lighthouse,

290
00:16:33,568 --> 00:16:34,588
and it's stuck down there.

291
00:16:34,848 --> 00:16:35,629
It's got something in it.

292
00:16:37,037 --> 00:16:39,339
You've got to bring the water up inside the lighthouse.

293
00:16:39,619 --> 00:16:41,381
It's definitely a surreal environment.

294
00:16:43,022 --> 00:16:46,204
But the puzzle itself doesn't necessarily feel so arbitrary.

295
00:16:47,986 --> 00:16:48,246
OK.

296
00:16:49,267 --> 00:16:52,349
While we were designing, this was so great for us.

297
00:16:52,909 --> 00:16:53,930
We had no fans.

298
00:16:54,170 --> 00:16:55,171
We had no demographic.

299
00:16:55,231 --> 00:16:56,312
No sales projections.

300
00:16:57,013 --> 00:17:00,155
No outside expectations of any sort.

301
00:17:02,116 --> 00:17:04,578
So it's like we just had a ton of fun.

302
00:17:06,183 --> 00:17:10,006
We didn't have to second guess any of our choices.

303
00:17:10,926 --> 00:17:13,848
We just got to explore the world as we were designing,

304
00:17:15,969 --> 00:17:17,811
which was fantastic.

305
00:17:18,091 --> 00:17:18,951
It was really, really...

306
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,234
I think it was a rare experience.

307
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:25,496
I don't know how often people get to really do that.

308
00:17:27,137 --> 00:17:28,698
We literally were just...

309
00:17:29,058 --> 00:17:31,440
We were creating this world for ourselves, and...

310
00:17:34,001 --> 00:17:34,282
I think...

311
00:17:34,769 --> 00:17:39,912
That was one of the reasons Mist did well, is because we made it for ourselves.

312
00:17:43,295 --> 00:17:48,019
And that all really took place during the design. A lot of it took place during the design.

313
00:17:48,139 --> 00:17:51,842
You know, just having fun with it. We got to have a lot of fun with it.

314
00:17:54,283 --> 00:17:59,347
So much so, and this is an example of that in just even the name. I don't know, it's like a

315
00:17:59,367 --> 00:18:03,090
30-second phone call, where it's just like, hey, what should we name it? How about Mist? Okay, good.

316
00:18:03,751 --> 00:18:03,971
You know.

317
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,941
Whereas, like, Riven, I don't know.

318
00:18:07,001 --> 00:18:09,462
The Riven, it took months to name Riven.

319
00:18:09,782 --> 00:18:12,924
So, because there was multiple people involved,

320
00:18:12,944 --> 00:18:14,144
multiple companies involved.

321
00:18:15,405 --> 00:18:16,045
It's just the difference.

322
00:18:18,186 --> 00:18:20,408
This is, once we had totally designed it,

323
00:18:20,428 --> 00:18:21,348
we came up with a proposal.

324
00:18:21,368 --> 00:18:23,649
These are pages from the proposal.

325
00:18:25,690 --> 00:18:26,371
Kind of interesting.

326
00:18:26,751 --> 00:18:28,192
Brought it back to Sunsoft.

327
00:18:28,252 --> 00:18:29,792
They said, great, we love it, let's go with it.

328
00:18:30,573 --> 00:18:32,994
That's the original budget for Myst.

329
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:36,332
We came up with the amount we thought it would cost.

330
00:18:36,872 --> 00:18:38,133
We doubled it, added some more.

331
00:18:38,153 --> 00:18:38,193
Ha.

332
00:18:42,656 --> 00:18:42,856
Um...

333
00:18:44,517 --> 00:18:45,998
Then we got together.

334
00:18:46,078 --> 00:18:47,319
We had hired a couple people,

335
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,160
and we play-tested it in a D&D fashion.

336
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,122
And we did that because we wanted to find

337
00:18:53,282 --> 00:18:55,464
any big problems with the game.

338
00:18:56,124 --> 00:18:57,525
So it's like, okay, you're standing on a dock.

339
00:18:57,985 --> 00:18:59,626
This is off to your right. This is in front of you.

340
00:19:00,126 --> 00:19:02,288
And we found issues with the game at that point.

341
00:19:03,069 --> 00:19:04,890
It really worked incredibly well.

342
00:19:08,411 --> 00:19:10,612
So I recommend that.

343
00:19:10,713 --> 00:19:12,493
It was excellent for us.

344
00:19:12,653 --> 00:19:13,074
Worked well.

345
00:19:13,614 --> 00:19:14,034
Production.

346
00:19:14,894 --> 00:19:16,015
There's some things in this production

347
00:19:16,035 --> 00:19:17,015
that aren't really production.

348
00:19:17,075 --> 00:19:17,476
I don't know.

349
00:19:17,516 --> 00:19:20,377
There's kind of little of both production

350
00:19:20,437 --> 00:19:21,377
and pre-production, but...

351
00:19:22,498 --> 00:19:23,378
We had a lot of questions

352
00:19:23,418 --> 00:19:25,179
about how do we resolve certain things

353
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:28,100
in production.

354
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:31,643
like our advanced graphics,

355
00:19:32,303 --> 00:19:34,784
our protagonist who makes this so-called ethical choice,

356
00:19:35,825 --> 00:19:38,746
our believable characters, and this non-linear plot.

357
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:45,710
Our advanced graphics, like I said,

358
00:19:45,750 --> 00:19:46,911
we were gonna hand-draw the whole thing,

359
00:19:46,931 --> 00:19:49,692
and I did spend some time toward the beginning

360
00:19:49,732 --> 00:19:51,393
just like in Photoshop.

361
00:19:51,673 --> 00:19:54,715
I was drawing things, and I got really scared,

362
00:19:55,835 --> 00:19:57,976
thinking, oh my God, what have we gotten ourselves into?

363
00:19:58,639 --> 00:20:00,100
There's no way. I can't draw all this stuff.

364
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:02,600
This is, like, this is gonna look crappy.

365
00:20:03,041 --> 00:20:05,221
And so, um, and then...

366
00:20:05,241 --> 00:20:08,162
I got out Stratavision,

367
00:20:08,482 --> 00:20:12,264
and I started drawing, um...

368
00:20:13,724 --> 00:20:16,285
basically gray scale, you know, extrusion maps.

369
00:20:18,177 --> 00:20:19,857
You don't know what an extrusion map is.

370
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:20,657
It isn't important.

371
00:20:20,677 --> 00:20:22,658
It was this kind of thing that kind of looked like this.

372
00:20:23,478 --> 00:20:25,139
And color maps.

373
00:20:25,279 --> 00:20:27,679
And I made something that looked like Myst Island.

374
00:20:28,079 --> 00:20:30,140
And I was able to create an island.

375
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:31,540
That's all that's important.

376
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,901
Once I created an island, a single island,

377
00:20:36,462 --> 00:20:41,423
then we knew, okay, we can make a 3D world.

378
00:20:43,044 --> 00:20:45,865
And it was like, from that point on...

379
00:20:47,778 --> 00:20:52,340
We were home free and we knew the world was gonna look very, very different.

380
00:20:54,381 --> 00:20:57,102
And cinematic. And we were thrilled.

381
00:20:58,103 --> 00:21:00,604
And then we went to town, you know, creating these worlds.

382
00:21:00,664 --> 00:21:06,206
Now right there, that screen you see is 920x1080. I've stretched it. I've made it very big.

383
00:21:06,806 --> 00:21:10,768
The actual size of Myst was more like that size.

384
00:21:11,468 --> 00:21:15,630
That was the gameplay size. So it was a very tiny resolution.

385
00:21:18,150 --> 00:21:23,155
We were able to do that. The shots took between 2 to 14 hours to render each shot.

386
00:21:24,517 --> 00:21:31,223
So the more complex shots, and we had to like do things like hide everything on the island except exactly what you were looking at.

387
00:21:35,447 --> 00:21:38,731
The protagonist of Coerce is whoever's playing the game.

388
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:40,532
And they got this whole...

389
00:21:42,622 --> 00:21:46,465
ethical decision thing. It was just, for us, it was as simple as choosing one of the brothers.

390
00:21:46,485 --> 00:21:51,148
It was one was good and one was evil. And at that point, we hadn't added this other

391
00:21:51,289 --> 00:21:51,669
choice.

392
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:59,855
As far as believable characters, we had some real problems there. Because there was this

393
00:22:00,235 --> 00:22:07,660
issue of one-way communication. When you're playing this, the other characters, any characters

394
00:22:07,700 --> 00:22:10,843
you meet, they communicate to you.

395
00:22:12,657 --> 00:22:15,758
They communicate to you, and you don't get to communicate to them.

396
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,419
Yes!

397
00:22:17,519 --> 00:22:17,859
Bless you.

398
00:22:19,419 --> 00:22:21,600
And you're in a non-linear world.

399
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:25,082
At any point in time, while this person is talking to you, you can just walk away.

400
00:22:25,462 --> 00:22:27,703
It totally breaks the spell of believability.

401
00:22:29,223 --> 00:22:33,585
As well, we had no method of displaying video at that point in time.

402
00:22:33,605 --> 00:22:38,027
When we began the game, when we began production, QuickTime did not exist.

403
00:22:38,187 --> 00:22:39,708
So there were some ways.

404
00:22:40,416 --> 00:22:42,377
to display something like video,

405
00:22:42,757 --> 00:22:44,238
they just weren't really that...

406
00:22:44,858 --> 00:22:45,979
they didn't do it very well.

407
00:22:47,259 --> 00:22:52,461
So, we thought we needed to design around these limits.

408
00:22:53,302 --> 00:22:56,143
And in terms of a one-way communication,

409
00:22:57,424 --> 00:22:59,545
you know, with whatever characters you come across,

410
00:23:00,285 --> 00:23:01,025
them speaking.

411
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:05,680
in this sort of monologue style,

412
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:08,061
we tried to feature it as much as possible

413
00:23:08,581 --> 00:23:11,702
with a one-way device of some sort.

414
00:23:12,803 --> 00:23:17,584
In terms of a nonlinear world,

415
00:23:17,624 --> 00:23:19,805
again, we tried to feature that problem.

416
00:23:21,465 --> 00:23:22,926
And we'd say that all the time.

417
00:23:22,946 --> 00:23:24,006
Randall and I would always say,

418
00:23:24,886 --> 00:23:26,987
don't fix it as much as feature it.

419
00:23:28,438 --> 00:23:30,718
But we tried to feature that nonlinear world

420
00:23:30,758 --> 00:23:34,659
with some sort of location-based device, you know.

421
00:23:34,839 --> 00:23:38,120
And both of those issues we featured

422
00:23:41,401 --> 00:23:43,181
with the books that they were in.

423
00:23:44,301 --> 00:23:46,401
So you had to go there

424
00:23:47,662 --> 00:23:50,622
and you had to be in that location,

425
00:23:50,682 --> 00:23:52,143
and they were in these little books.

426
00:23:52,243 --> 00:23:53,943
QuickTime came along halfway through development,

427
00:23:55,883 --> 00:23:56,283
which was...

428
00:23:57,817 --> 00:24:01,080
Oh my God, when it came along, we were so thrilled.

429
00:24:01,581 --> 00:24:02,101
We needed it.

430
00:24:03,082 --> 00:24:14,052
So with them, in these books, it was almost like a barrier existed naturally between you

431
00:24:14,672 --> 00:24:14,972
and the book.

432
00:24:16,479 --> 00:24:19,822
these characters. It was okay for you to walk away from them

433
00:24:20,483 --> 00:24:23,926
because there was almost a screen or plate of glass between you and them

434
00:24:24,727 --> 00:24:29,231
and they were fading in and out all the time and if you had come across them in the real

435
00:24:29,271 --> 00:24:31,273
world it would be okay to walk away from them.

436
00:24:33,095 --> 00:24:36,518
That's kind of it. It felt more believable in that respect.

437
00:24:38,619 --> 00:24:41,922
So we wanted to make something that felt as believable as possible.

438
00:24:42,422 --> 00:24:45,805
It feels really not very believable when a character's standing there talking to you

439
00:24:46,105 --> 00:24:47,307
and you turn around and walk away.

440
00:24:47,667 --> 00:24:49,348
Or when a character's standing there talking to you

441
00:24:49,749 --> 00:24:51,230
and you can't say anything back to them.

442
00:24:52,451 --> 00:24:56,254
In this sort of scenario, they didn't expect you to talk to them

443
00:24:56,835 --> 00:24:58,316
because they couldn't have heard you anyway.

444
00:25:01,599 --> 00:25:01,879
Plot.

445
00:25:06,063 --> 00:25:06,323
Okay.

446
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:14,081
Our plot was set up in, basically like the islands were set up.

447
00:25:14,641 --> 00:25:16,922
Very simple style of plot.

448
00:25:18,163 --> 00:25:22,985
If I were to outline it, this is basically what it would have looked like in the beginning

449
00:25:23,065 --> 00:25:24,886
when we had first designed the game.

450
00:25:26,746 --> 00:25:30,928
It was something that anybody, or at least us designing the game, could have fit in our

451
00:25:31,328 --> 00:25:34,370
heads, that we could, that we did fit in our minds very easily.

452
00:25:35,690 --> 00:25:35,930
So...

453
00:25:37,742 --> 00:25:39,042
It made us happy.

454
00:25:40,804 --> 00:25:41,024
Um...

455
00:25:42,625 --> 00:25:43,705
I'm just going to compare it

456
00:25:43,785 --> 00:25:46,527
against the flowchart

457
00:25:46,547 --> 00:25:49,509
for Riven's plot.

458
00:25:53,312 --> 00:25:53,672
There was...

459
00:25:53,832 --> 00:25:54,853
It was so complex,

460
00:25:55,693 --> 00:25:58,515
we never could keep it straight.

461
00:25:59,836 --> 00:26:01,016
Um...and, um...

462
00:26:02,017 --> 00:26:03,898
I think, um...

463
00:26:06,884 --> 00:26:08,785
As the developers of Riven,

464
00:26:09,045 --> 00:26:13,829
it made it frustrating to work on, for one thing.

465
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:23,858
It also wasn't contained,

466
00:26:24,318 --> 00:26:28,762
and you couldn't just sit there and imagine the story

467
00:26:29,542 --> 00:26:32,845
from beginning to end as you had experienced it.

468
00:26:33,366 --> 00:26:34,787
Like, what is this contained plot?

469
00:26:35,547 --> 00:26:35,688
So...

470
00:26:36,629 --> 00:26:39,210
Whereas Myst, you could think, oh, okay, this was the story.

471
00:26:39,250 --> 00:26:41,752
This was bum, bum, bum, A plus B, B, you know, this is,

472
00:26:42,412 --> 00:26:45,033
and it was, so it was, it was, it was, again,

473
00:26:45,093 --> 00:26:47,715
looking back in hindsight, I think it was another reason

474
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:49,696
why, why Myst was successful.

475
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:53,658
Climactic ending, this was something that came later

476
00:26:53,858 --> 00:26:55,079
after our initial design.

477
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,600
Ta-da!

478
00:26:57,900 --> 00:27:00,942
That's my effect, it's not an audio presentation.

479
00:27:02,422 --> 00:27:02,823
Atrus.

480
00:27:04,094 --> 00:27:08,257
We realized at a certain point in time that we needed

481
00:27:08,277 --> 00:27:15,441
this other sort of character at the ending.

482
00:27:17,002 --> 00:27:21,905
Because people just choosing between the two brothers was not enough.

483
00:27:22,605 --> 00:27:24,546
They needed something more toward the ending.

484
00:27:24,906 --> 00:27:31,070
And so we realized that this father would make that choice more complex.

485
00:27:32,251 --> 00:27:32,391
And...

486
00:27:33,957 --> 00:27:34,997
And so we added Atrus.

487
00:27:35,817 --> 00:27:38,438
And so it just changed the ending

488
00:27:38,478 --> 00:27:40,038
to something that looked a little bit more like this.

489
00:27:42,379 --> 00:27:44,820
And in terms of this whole ethical decision...

490
00:27:46,940 --> 00:27:49,401
aspect of the game and an emotional provocation,

491
00:27:50,201 --> 00:27:52,662
you know, I think it had that.

492
00:27:52,802 --> 00:27:55,383
I'm not sure if we really succeeded so much,

493
00:27:56,223 --> 00:27:57,323
as much as we wanted to.

494
00:27:57,603 --> 00:28:01,144
You know, I know there's games today that...

495
00:28:03,164 --> 00:28:04,845
that really emotionally provoke,

496
00:28:05,725 --> 00:28:06,626
we attempted it,

497
00:28:08,207 --> 00:28:08,567
and...

498
00:28:09,167 --> 00:28:11,869
and we did our best

499
00:28:12,789 --> 00:28:15,230
to emotionally provoke people.

500
00:28:15,951 --> 00:28:20,073
And I think instead, it was a fun game.

501
00:28:20,253 --> 00:28:21,534
But it was an effort.

502
00:28:22,674 --> 00:28:23,595
Technical limitations.

503
00:28:24,515 --> 00:28:25,816
This is kind of interesting.

504
00:28:26,356 --> 00:28:27,657
A single-speed CD-ROM,

505
00:28:28,097 --> 00:28:29,258
it was slow.

506
00:28:29,298 --> 00:28:31,759
A single-speed CD-ROM is really, really slow.

507
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:34,900
And so we were dealing...

508
00:28:39,001 --> 00:28:40,442
with slow enough speeds

509
00:28:40,742 --> 00:28:42,683
that we had to carefully lay out the island

510
00:28:43,503 --> 00:28:45,484
or the islands on by hand

511
00:28:46,484 --> 00:28:47,725
onto the disk.

512
00:28:47,905 --> 00:28:49,045
So, you know, Mist Island,

513
00:28:49,065 --> 00:28:50,906
and this is kind of an exaggeration.

514
00:28:52,247 --> 00:28:53,867
I mean, it's totally an exaggeration,

515
00:28:53,947 --> 00:28:57,029
but, uh, Mist Island would go here,

516
00:28:57,129 --> 00:28:58,889
for example, Stone Ship Age,

517
00:28:58,949 --> 00:28:59,950
and then so on.

518
00:29:02,026 --> 00:29:03,748
But even more than that, you know,

519
00:29:04,548 --> 00:29:07,550
we would say you've got all the shots

520
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,031
and animations along this path.

521
00:29:09,852 --> 00:29:13,094
They would all go together in one place.

522
00:29:14,815 --> 00:29:17,317
Or likewise, the shots in this location.

523
00:29:18,378 --> 00:29:21,300
So if we hadn't have done that, you know,

524
00:29:21,340 --> 00:29:25,042
the speed of the CD-ROM just wouldn't have...

525
00:29:26,103 --> 00:29:27,204
we wouldn't have been able to...

526
00:29:29,065 --> 00:29:31,787
from the drive fast enough for anybody to play this game.

527
00:29:34,169 --> 00:29:35,310
Okay, distribution.

528
00:29:35,570 --> 00:29:36,891
I think this is kind of interesting,

529
00:29:38,892 --> 00:29:40,594
just for us, just as a memory.

530
00:29:42,755 --> 00:29:44,737
We did show it to a couple of people,

531
00:29:44,977 --> 00:29:46,759
but we were working with Broderbund at the time.

532
00:29:47,639 --> 00:29:50,221
And, you know, we had all these images of the first island,

533
00:29:50,241 --> 00:29:54,565
and this was what we showed to Broderbund

534
00:29:54,585 --> 00:29:55,786
when we first sat down with them.

535
00:29:58,470 --> 00:30:00,371
when we finally sat down with them, and they were like,

536
00:30:01,931 --> 00:30:02,411
they loved it.

537
00:30:03,111 --> 00:30:05,472
And that's who we went with for Myst.

538
00:30:07,332 --> 00:30:08,373
And they said to us,

539
00:30:09,913 --> 00:30:11,113
and I think it was soon after that,

540
00:30:11,173 --> 00:30:11,874
they said to us, look,

541
00:30:12,794 --> 00:30:14,754
why don't you try music with this?

542
00:30:16,555 --> 00:30:21,856
And we were not real keen on that idea.

543
00:30:24,256 --> 00:30:27,397
There weren't a lot of video games out with music.

544
00:30:28,107 --> 00:30:31,067
At that point, I don't remember exactly what video games

545
00:30:31,608 --> 00:30:32,588
had music in them.

546
00:30:33,008 --> 00:30:35,989
What we liked was diegetic music,

547
00:30:36,189 --> 00:30:38,490
and that was something we had been doing in our previous games.

548
00:30:39,110 --> 00:30:41,931
So, you know, for example, you walk into a radio station,

549
00:30:42,871 --> 00:30:45,152
you go in there, you pull some tapes into...

550
00:30:45,392 --> 00:30:46,792
You program the radio station,

551
00:30:47,092 --> 00:30:49,793
and then you go to another place where there's a radio,

552
00:30:49,873 --> 00:30:52,634
and you hear the music that you've programmed.

553
00:30:54,534 --> 00:30:57,295
So we felt like if you had soundtrack...

554
00:30:58,057 --> 00:30:58,977
It would seem false.

555
00:30:59,797 --> 00:31:01,318
It would just pull you out of the environment.

556
00:31:02,899 --> 00:31:05,720
Um, because, you know, music doesn't play in the real world,

557
00:31:06,080 --> 00:31:08,181
and so why would it play in this place

558
00:31:08,201 --> 00:31:10,743
that we're trying to make it be so believable and so real?

559
00:31:11,623 --> 00:31:13,424
Um, and so we said,

560
00:31:13,464 --> 00:31:15,125
okay, well, we're gonna write some music,

561
00:31:15,165 --> 00:31:16,025
and we're gonna put it in Mist,

562
00:31:16,265 --> 00:31:17,566
and we're gonna show you how wrong you are.

563
00:31:19,147 --> 00:31:21,127
And so we did that.

564
00:31:21,288 --> 00:31:23,188
We wrote some music, and we put it in Mist,

565
00:31:23,729 --> 00:31:26,090
and instead, like, it really worked well.

566
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:26,970
And so...

567
00:31:28,725 --> 00:31:31,045
So it's like, great, okay, well now we need to write a soundtrack.

568
00:31:31,345 --> 00:31:32,166
And so we did that.

569
00:31:33,166 --> 00:31:33,726
And, um...

570
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,067
In terms of post-production...

571
00:31:38,227 --> 00:31:39,767
Oh, okay, this was, this is good.

572
00:31:40,108 --> 00:31:40,228
Um...

573
00:31:41,868 --> 00:31:44,089
We did pretty extensive game testing.

574
00:31:44,829 --> 00:31:45,009
Um...

575
00:31:46,389 --> 00:31:48,810
Where we would put two people in front of the game,

576
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:50,310
and we put, we always did it with two people,

577
00:31:50,350 --> 00:31:52,090
because two people, um...

578
00:31:53,051 --> 00:31:53,851
would talk to one another.

579
00:31:54,999 --> 00:31:57,381
Whenever we would sit one person in front of the game,

580
00:31:57,441 --> 00:31:59,022
they would just like play, play, play,

581
00:31:59,102 --> 00:32:00,323
you know, find a mistake or whatever.

582
00:32:00,343 --> 00:32:02,545
But we would sit two people

583
00:32:02,965 --> 00:32:04,166
so they could talk to one another

584
00:32:04,486 --> 00:32:07,809
and then we could hear whatever they didn't like or did like.

585
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:13,213
And which, like, you know, we would sit back there.

586
00:32:13,273 --> 00:32:15,174
And when I say we would sit back there behind them

587
00:32:15,194 --> 00:32:16,215
or stand back there behind them,

588
00:32:16,235 --> 00:32:19,458
it was Rand and I standing behind them

589
00:32:19,558 --> 00:32:21,499
writing notes, extensive notes.

590
00:32:21,619 --> 00:32:23,821
And whatever, you know, whatever they would talk about.

591
00:32:24,420 --> 00:32:32,202
whatever they didn't like, or, you know. And, and then we were able to change things on

592
00:32:32,222 --> 00:32:38,764
the fly. So, like, if they're here, and they clicked here to go to the planetarium, it's

593
00:32:38,804 --> 00:32:42,545
like, OK, great, we didn't make that work because this is the button to go to the planetarium.

594
00:32:43,045 --> 00:32:52,548
We could just step in immediately and we could fix that. And so this was, like, vitally,

595
00:32:52,588 --> 00:32:53,328
vitally important.

596
00:32:54,690 --> 00:32:59,393
Because we made... we wanted the game to be accessible

597
00:32:59,413 --> 00:33:00,713
by everyone.

598
00:33:00,733 --> 00:33:03,035
And if they clicked on something and it didn't work,

599
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,917
well, that was something... that was our problem.

600
00:33:05,957 --> 00:33:08,238
That was, like, you know, that was something we had done wrong.

601
00:33:08,578 --> 00:33:12,681
And so we spent a lot of time doing this kind of testing.

602
00:33:13,841 --> 00:33:15,422
We wanted the interface of the game

603
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,163
to be totally, totally invisible

604
00:33:18,704 --> 00:33:21,406
and... and playable by...

605
00:33:22,142 --> 00:33:23,903
not necessarily by gamers.

606
00:33:24,183 --> 00:33:26,063
We didn't make the game for gamers.

607
00:33:26,103 --> 00:33:28,924
We wanted it to be playable by non-gamers.

608
00:33:31,604 --> 00:33:34,625
And so we played it with a lot of non-gamers.

609
00:33:35,545 --> 00:33:39,986
And so that, I can't stress how much that helped us.

610
00:33:41,727 --> 00:33:43,587
It also showed us that there were problems

611
00:33:43,647 --> 00:33:47,808
with the story and setting up the game.

612
00:33:47,868 --> 00:33:48,008
We...

613
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,663
Like, we didn't have what I guess we call an inciting incident.

614
00:33:55,065 --> 00:33:56,726
Like, we put this note.

615
00:33:57,386 --> 00:33:59,488
We put this note in the beginning of the game.

616
00:34:00,709 --> 00:34:03,932
Um, it hadn't had it previous to this,

617
00:34:04,532 --> 00:34:05,373
so we added it.

618
00:34:06,374 --> 00:34:08,376
And it introduced people

619
00:34:09,437 --> 00:34:11,578
to this new thing we added,

620
00:34:11,598 --> 00:34:13,540
a door right by the dock.

621
00:34:14,701 --> 00:34:18,044
And a message from our main...

622
00:34:19,362 --> 00:34:21,583
character now, this person Atrus.

623
00:34:22,183 --> 00:34:24,585
And Atrus now gives the player a message

624
00:34:24,805 --> 00:34:26,346
and sends them on their quest.

625
00:34:27,266 --> 00:34:29,208
So people, you know, before this was added,

626
00:34:29,248 --> 00:34:30,168
people didn't know what to do.

627
00:34:30,188 --> 00:34:31,729
It was something like this playtesting,

628
00:34:31,749 --> 00:34:32,670
this kind of playtesting,

629
00:34:32,690 --> 00:34:34,131
where Rand and I were directly involved

630
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:35,912
for long, long periods of time,

631
00:34:36,772 --> 00:34:40,274
really gave us a lot of vital information.

632
00:34:42,656 --> 00:34:46,798
Here's our new flowchart with the floor chamber.

633
00:34:47,813 --> 00:34:53,015
OK, last thing I'm going to quickly touch on here is we did this focus group testing.

634
00:34:54,115 --> 00:34:58,337
And this is something Broderbund did, and we just thought, what?

635
00:34:58,797 --> 00:34:59,698
Focus group testing?

636
00:35:01,478 --> 00:35:07,161
I just think it's kind of funny and interesting, and they brought this one group in, and we

637
00:35:07,181 --> 00:35:08,221
were like, what?

638
00:35:09,042 --> 00:35:10,662
Oh, no, they hated the game.

639
00:35:11,543 --> 00:35:13,083
The first group hated the game.

640
00:35:13,263 --> 00:35:16,425
And, oh, man.

641
00:35:17,850 --> 00:35:19,111
It was really discouraging.

642
00:35:19,931 --> 00:35:23,092
And they brought Group 2 in, and man, this group just,

643
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:24,353
they loved it.

644
00:35:25,313 --> 00:35:28,674
And I think that was the first time Rand and I got this sense

645
00:35:28,734 --> 00:35:33,936
that, wow, this might sell like 100,000 copies.

646
00:35:37,098 --> 00:35:39,218
You know, maybe we'll make our money back,

647
00:35:39,298 --> 00:35:42,900
or maybe we can do another game after this.

648
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:45,841
We were so happy.

649
00:35:46,248 --> 00:35:48,369
There was a guy there, Bruce Fredericks.

650
00:35:49,269 --> 00:35:50,730
I don't know, I don't know what he's doing now.

651
00:35:52,431 --> 00:35:53,571
He showed slogans.

652
00:35:54,832 --> 00:35:56,933
And so he showed a bunch of slogans to these guys

653
00:35:56,953 --> 00:35:57,993
at the focus group testing.

654
00:35:58,334 --> 00:36:00,275
He showed, one of the slogans he showed.

655
00:36:03,176 --> 00:36:05,177
And I, oh god, I hated that.

656
00:36:07,498 --> 00:36:07,958
No.

657
00:36:08,979 --> 00:36:10,379
So it's such a sale.

658
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:13,341
And you know, over the years, I've just like.

659
00:36:16,026 --> 00:36:16,867
become your world.

660
00:36:20,589 --> 00:36:20,789
So.

661
00:36:21,089 --> 00:36:22,110
OK, well that's it.

662
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:23,351
You know?

663
00:36:23,771 --> 00:36:24,272
I don't have.

664
00:36:40,142 --> 00:36:40,503
Thank you.

665
00:36:40,563 --> 00:36:40,843
Thanks.

666
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:43,245
So questions?

667
00:36:46,745 --> 00:36:50,648
So, I was curious, so you mentioned a figure of $265,000.

668
00:36:51,088 --> 00:36:58,074
And you were saying that you asked for an amount and then you doubled it,

669
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:01,056
or they gave you double what you asked for, or something.

670
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:05,119
What was the first number you asked for and then got?

671
00:37:05,539 --> 00:37:06,961
Okay, great question.

672
00:37:07,501 --> 00:37:11,784
We came up with an amount, we doubled it, then added some more,

673
00:37:12,345 --> 00:37:13,686
and that end figure was $265,000.

674
00:37:27,272 --> 00:37:30,613
Oh, yeah, well, we actually spent more than that.

675
00:37:33,413 --> 00:37:35,974
But, you know, if only it had occurred to us that,

676
00:37:36,094 --> 00:37:38,755
hey, you can go back to the people who are paying it

677
00:37:38,815 --> 00:37:39,955
and ask for more.

678
00:37:41,235 --> 00:37:43,516
Oh, you know, it never occurred to us.

679
00:37:44,456 --> 00:37:46,977
So we were, like, really thinly stretched

680
00:37:47,117 --> 00:37:49,478
during the development of the thing.

681
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:50,898
And, yeah.

682
00:37:52,539 --> 00:37:54,459
I don't... the answer to your question is,

683
00:37:54,619 --> 00:37:56,400
I don't remember what it actually cost.

684
00:37:57,798 --> 00:37:58,258
Right.

685
00:38:01,399 --> 00:38:03,940
Were you, so it looks like you used HyperCard to make this.

686
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:06,621
Did you have to totally hack it like crazy,

687
00:38:06,681 --> 00:38:08,381
or was it like out of the box HyperCard?

688
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:09,222
Yeah.

689
00:38:09,782 --> 00:38:12,663
The question was, did we have to hack HyperCard like crazy?

690
00:38:12,683 --> 00:38:15,824
Because we used HyperCard to create this game.

691
00:38:16,804 --> 00:38:18,525
We didn't have to hack it like crazy,

692
00:38:18,545 --> 00:38:21,666
but we did have a couple of x commands.

693
00:38:21,686 --> 00:38:23,646
And one of the x commands we used was to have,

694
00:38:23,947 --> 00:38:27,248
the main x command we used was to do color in HyperCard.

695
00:38:27,845 --> 00:38:31,587
But mostly, no, it was pretty straightforward.

696
00:38:31,627 --> 00:38:31,867
I mean...

697
00:38:31,887 --> 00:38:36,530
It, I mean, we were able to.

698
00:38:36,550 --> 00:38:40,392
I would kind of say that if HyperCard hadn't have existed,

699
00:38:40,412 --> 00:38:43,874
I don't know how we would have ever made Myst

700
00:38:44,675 --> 00:38:47,556
because, or any of our previous products.

701
00:38:48,137 --> 00:38:49,197
It was so...

702
00:38:49,958 --> 00:38:51,339
It allowed us to do things so quickly.

703
00:38:51,679 --> 00:38:53,060
Even like the play testing I mentioned.

704
00:38:54,222 --> 00:38:56,123
where we could just stay there and watch people.

705
00:38:56,143 --> 00:38:58,364
If they clicked on something, we could just, boom, pop in,

706
00:38:58,825 --> 00:39:00,986
change something instantaneously.

707
00:39:01,346 --> 00:39:02,367
HyperCard was amazing.

708
00:39:03,108 --> 00:39:05,749
Kind of funny, when I was putting together

709
00:39:05,789 --> 00:39:09,532
this little presentation, I was using Apple Keynote.

710
00:39:09,672 --> 00:39:11,693
It reminded me so much of using HyperCard.

711
00:39:13,695 --> 00:39:17,718
Not quite the same thing, but yeah, HyperCard was.

712
00:39:19,554 --> 00:39:23,037
An amazing tool, you know, I wish something like that still existed,

713
00:39:23,857 --> 00:39:27,980
except that you could, like, put things up online with,

714
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:31,683
but it was just an amazing tool for us.

715
00:39:33,764 --> 00:39:37,166
Could you please briefly discuss the design process behind the bathysphere?

716
00:39:37,967 --> 00:39:38,167
What?

717
00:39:38,748 --> 00:39:39,588
The bathysphere. ...

718
00:39:47,914 --> 00:39:48,715
Really hard.

719
00:39:49,383 --> 00:39:51,664
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

720
00:39:52,024 --> 00:39:52,625
Okay, yeah.

721
00:39:52,985 --> 00:39:54,986
That was our worst puzzle.

722
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:56,887
Yes, it was.

723
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,491
You know, okay, the design process on that,

724
00:40:03,551 --> 00:40:05,312
originally, you walked through it.

725
00:40:07,053 --> 00:40:10,015
So all the drawings we have are, like, pathways,

726
00:40:10,875 --> 00:40:12,856
and then, um, like, little...

727
00:40:13,310 --> 00:40:15,232
pagoda things that you get to.

728
00:40:15,312 --> 00:40:18,234
And you, you, so it was like this huge,

729
00:40:18,394 --> 00:40:19,976
almost labyrinthian maze.

730
00:40:21,077 --> 00:40:24,139
Um, and it looked really cool in our heads.

731
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:28,222
Um, but then when we got to the production,

732
00:40:28,823 --> 00:40:31,445
we realized, oh, my, how will we possibly create it?

733
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:33,426
In fact, we, we started, Chuck Carter was the one

734
00:40:33,446 --> 00:40:35,288
who, who, who made all that.

735
00:40:35,868 --> 00:40:37,630
And we, he started actually...

736
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:45,081
making it and then we realized, oh, this is going to be this massively huge thing. How

737
00:40:45,141 --> 00:40:49,542
are we going to do this? And it's going to be cumbersome to play. Because you're going

738
00:40:49,562 --> 00:40:54,803
to be walking forever and, but, but you know, you actually find your way through it with

739
00:40:54,903 --> 00:41:03,065
sounds. We failed on that one totally. That's the answer. So, that's one of those arbitrary

740
00:41:03,845 --> 00:41:05,825
things we made. That's the worst puzzle in the game.

741
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:11,348
Oh, um...

742
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,772
I just wanted to say I played Myst in the fourth grade

743
00:41:15,792 --> 00:41:17,973
in the computer lab, and it literally has changed my life.

744
00:41:18,014 --> 00:41:20,035
It's probably why I'm actually here

745
00:41:20,055 --> 00:41:23,057
instead of, I don't know, being a lawyer or something stupid.

746
00:41:23,658 --> 00:41:23,798
Um...

747
00:41:24,959 --> 00:41:25,820
So thank you for that.

748
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:28,462
Um, my question, did you go into the production

749
00:41:29,342 --> 00:41:30,763
knowing Stratavision, or did you have to learn it

750
00:41:30,924 --> 00:41:31,844
sort of as you went?

751
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:38,109
Um, before in some of our previous products,

752
00:41:38,129 --> 00:41:38,690
um, kind of, you know,

753
00:41:39,405 --> 00:41:46,595
There was something we did called Spelunx, and we had in little pieces, little bits here and there, I had used it.

754
00:41:47,716 --> 00:41:49,058
We got to know it really well in NIST.

755
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:50,460
So...

756
00:41:51,522 --> 00:41:54,145
And it was simple. It was a very simple program as well.

757
00:41:55,507 --> 00:41:56,308
Very easy to learn.

758
00:41:57,312 --> 00:41:59,733
Take one from the backseat mics way back here.

759
00:41:59,753 --> 00:42:00,233
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

760
00:42:00,253 --> 00:42:01,193
Yeah, you got two sets.

761
00:42:01,433 --> 00:42:02,514
Back there.

762
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:03,214
Hi, Robin.

763
00:42:03,254 --> 00:42:05,714
I'm Ryan from Untold Entertainment.

764
00:42:05,955 --> 00:42:06,855
I build adventure games.

765
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:08,535
Thanks so much for making Myst.

766
00:42:08,615 --> 00:42:10,356
It was an inspiration for sure.

767
00:42:10,376 --> 00:42:11,216
Thank you.

768
00:42:11,876 --> 00:42:15,657
Speaking of inspiration, it was really fascinating to me that you listed...

769
00:42:16,017 --> 00:42:17,618
Is there a weird echo on this thing or what?

770
00:42:18,218 --> 00:42:22,019
It was interesting that you listed D&D as an inspiration, but you never mentioned the

771
00:42:22,619 --> 00:42:22,819
third...

772
00:42:23,468 --> 00:42:26,210
person graphic adventure games with a lot of inventory manipulation.

773
00:42:26,230 --> 00:42:27,491
Were those not even on your radar?

774
00:42:27,531 --> 00:42:28,752
Like, did you guys ever play them?

775
00:42:29,232 --> 00:42:30,013
Third person...

776
00:42:30,513 --> 00:42:32,114
Sierra stuff, LucasArts stuff?

777
00:42:32,475 --> 00:42:33,495
Not really on the radar.

778
00:42:33,715 --> 00:42:33,896
Wow.

779
00:42:33,936 --> 00:42:35,937
We just, we didn't play them.

780
00:42:35,957 --> 00:42:36,117
Um...

781
00:42:37,298 --> 00:42:38,298
Yeah.

782
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:39,860
I had never played any of them.

783
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,982
Now, maybe Rand had played some of those,

784
00:42:43,242 --> 00:42:44,162
or, you know, some of those,

785
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:46,364
but I hadn't played any of those.

786
00:42:47,411 --> 00:42:50,112
Yeah, I think the only game I ever played,

787
00:42:50,512 --> 00:42:52,773
previous to Myst, was probably Zork 2.

788
00:42:53,413 --> 00:42:53,593
Um...

789
00:42:55,633 --> 00:42:58,054
And, and then I just, you know,

790
00:42:58,114 --> 00:43:00,115
and that wasn't really my interest.

791
00:43:01,195 --> 00:43:03,256
Games, I didn't like, I didn't like games.

792
00:43:03,316 --> 00:43:04,076
I didn't play games.

793
00:43:04,556 --> 00:43:06,196
Now, I play a lot more games.

794
00:43:07,297 --> 00:43:08,057
That's wild.

795
00:43:08,177 --> 00:43:08,797
So, yeah.

796
00:43:08,817 --> 00:43:12,738
Um, how about way in the back over there?

797
00:43:13,688 --> 00:43:18,792
man in audience 1 Hi. First, thank you very much. Beautiful game. It sounded like you

798
00:43:18,812 --> 00:43:23,815
had some really creative approaches to game testing, and we just kind of scratched the

799
00:43:23,835 --> 00:43:28,158
surface with you. And I specifically thought it was really interesting when you said you

800
00:43:29,059 --> 00:43:36,244
watched, not just watch to see what people would click on, but how kind of you would

801
00:43:36,304 --> 00:43:41,387
react to that. And I wondered if you had more to say about that, like what your expectations

802
00:43:41,427 --> 00:43:42,208
were going in.

803
00:43:42,997 --> 00:43:46,679
and kind of how those shaped your design process

804
00:43:46,739 --> 00:43:47,560
for the puzzles.

805
00:43:50,222 --> 00:43:52,423
Um...yeah, I mean, not...

806
00:43:52,964 --> 00:43:55,846
just that, you know, we really wanted this to be a game

807
00:43:55,886 --> 00:43:57,007
that, you know, um...

808
00:43:59,528 --> 00:44:00,649
We didn't have a target audience,

809
00:44:00,869 --> 00:44:01,950
and we just really wanted it to be a game

810
00:44:01,990 --> 00:44:05,793
that a very wide group of people

811
00:44:05,933 --> 00:44:06,813
could play and enjoy.

812
00:44:07,396 --> 00:44:09,638
And the interface, in terms of the interface,

813
00:44:09,658 --> 00:44:11,219
the interface was extremely important to us.

814
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:14,382
That it kind of feel like it not have an interface.

815
00:44:14,442 --> 00:44:16,264
So we just tested that again and again and again.

816
00:44:17,305 --> 00:44:17,765
So...

817
00:44:20,508 --> 00:44:21,649
That was, you know, we...

818
00:44:23,334 --> 00:44:27,116
that testing was extremely, extremely important to us to make sure.

819
00:44:27,557 --> 00:44:30,038
You know, the game feels like there is an interface,

820
00:44:30,279 --> 00:44:33,901
and we wanted it to feel cinematic in a sense,

821
00:44:33,941 --> 00:44:35,723
with no computerized elements.

822
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:36,663
Computerized.

823
00:44:37,324 --> 00:44:38,625
And, um...

824
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:42,167
And so we designed around that.

825
00:44:42,407 --> 00:44:42,828
You know, there's...

826
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:46,851
You know, whenever Rand and I, during design, were tempted to...

827
00:44:58,119 --> 00:45:00,660
to give it the cinematic feel as much as possible.

828
00:45:01,541 --> 00:45:03,402
Because we know there's an audience out there.

829
00:45:03,442 --> 00:45:05,122
We knew at the time there was an audience out there

830
00:45:05,162 --> 00:45:07,404
that is kind of...

831
00:45:09,945 --> 00:45:12,446
So, and then the testing, I don't know.

832
00:45:12,666 --> 00:45:13,426
I don't know what I'm saying.

833
00:45:13,446 --> 00:45:15,307
I don't know if that answers your question.

834
00:45:15,667 --> 00:45:16,128
Ha ha ha!

835
00:45:18,907 --> 00:45:23,889
Okay. I was just curious, you mentioned when you started, when your brother contacted you with the idea,

836
00:45:23,949 --> 00:45:25,950
you were living in Washington and he was in Texas.

837
00:45:26,310 --> 00:45:31,873
So I was just curious how you guys managed the project and what was the division of labor like in general between you and your brother?

838
00:45:32,213 --> 00:45:40,097
Okay, yeah, well, you know, that went on for like, we lived separately until one of our kids' games.

839
00:45:42,317 --> 00:45:47,120
And then during, by the time Myst came along, we were in the same place.

840
00:45:48,395 --> 00:45:52,157
And so that was in Spokane, Washington.

841
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:56,199
And so it was really easy at that point.

842
00:45:57,479 --> 00:46:00,401
And was it like, were you both doing everything,

843
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:02,822
both doing art, both doing story, or did you kind of?

844
00:46:03,422 --> 00:46:05,203
Yeah, well, we were both designing.

845
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,465
So during the design process, we were totally doing,

846
00:46:09,485 --> 00:46:11,606
we were together in the same room,

847
00:46:11,666 --> 00:46:12,747
working on all of that together.

848
00:46:13,587 --> 00:46:16,829
And then I would go off and do the art.

849
00:46:17,639 --> 00:46:20,040
working with, like I said, Chuck Carter on Myst,

850
00:46:20,620 --> 00:46:22,921
and then Rand did all the programming.

851
00:46:24,962 --> 00:46:27,343
Yeah, scripting and etc.

852
00:46:28,043 --> 00:46:28,343
Thank you.

853
00:46:28,563 --> 00:46:28,803
All right.

854
00:46:28,903 --> 00:46:32,365
Hi, I love the games,

855
00:46:32,445 --> 00:46:34,866
and I decided to pick up the Myst novels a couple years ago,

856
00:46:35,046 --> 00:46:36,686
just like two years ago, and I really enjoyed them,

857
00:46:36,726 --> 00:46:38,367
and I enjoyed all the story that they filled in,

858
00:46:38,427 --> 00:46:41,948
but I guess I was kind of surprised by the scale of death and destruction in them.

859
00:46:42,048 --> 00:46:43,369
It's kind of different from the games,

860
00:46:43,409 --> 00:46:45,730
and I was wondering if you could comment on, like,

861
00:46:46,474 --> 00:46:47,835
What made you want to develop the backstory?

862
00:46:47,855 --> 00:46:49,676
Was it the fans or was it, you know, was it the head?

863
00:46:49,696 --> 00:46:50,076
Sure, yeah.

864
00:46:50,417 --> 00:46:51,477
We wanted to...

865
00:46:52,158 --> 00:46:53,078
At the point we were...

866
00:46:57,581 --> 00:46:58,081
We wanted...

867
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:01,063
We knew we were going to make another game.

868
00:47:01,563 --> 00:47:03,184
And I don't remember at what point that was.

869
00:47:04,705 --> 00:47:06,026
Probably after people's...

870
00:47:09,388 --> 00:47:10,929
They thought, oh, okay, well, we know we're going to...

871
00:47:11,129 --> 00:47:12,310
We knew there was more to the story.

872
00:47:13,515 --> 00:47:17,338
And then we thought, well, we wanted to tie those two things together,

873
00:47:17,898 --> 00:47:19,739
Myst and this next game we were going to make.

874
00:47:20,620 --> 00:47:24,703
And we came up with this idea of tying the two together with this book,

875
00:47:25,544 --> 00:47:26,104
this novel.

876
00:47:28,686 --> 00:47:32,288
And we kind of liked the idea, OK, it's a book, this is a world about books.

877
00:47:34,730 --> 00:47:36,752
So that made sense to us.

878
00:47:38,993 --> 00:47:40,835
I don't know, does that answer your question?

879
00:47:47,175 --> 00:47:49,537
How long did it take for you guys to actually create a game?

880
00:47:49,757 --> 00:47:52,620
And you said that you were running low on funds.

881
00:47:52,960 --> 00:47:55,742
So how did you manage that, and what did your publisher say

882
00:47:55,782 --> 00:47:58,825
when you talked with them about your planning

883
00:47:58,905 --> 00:48:00,626
that didn't work out so well?

884
00:48:00,706 --> 00:48:01,467
It took two years.

885
00:48:02,908 --> 00:48:03,909
And what was the second part?

886
00:48:05,230 --> 00:48:06,351
What did your publisher say?

887
00:48:06,411 --> 00:48:08,132
Did you meet your schedules,

888
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:10,034
regardless of the money running out?

889
00:48:10,134 --> 00:48:13,697
Well, we, you know, we worked hard to meet our schedules.

890
00:48:13,757 --> 00:48:14,577
Sometimes we met them.

891
00:48:14,617 --> 00:48:15,478
Sometimes we didn't.

892
00:48:17,759 --> 00:48:19,640
But we always got close enough, you know.

893
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:21,961
And then we had two publishers,

894
00:48:22,041 --> 00:48:24,022
because we had Sunsoft,

895
00:48:25,063 --> 00:48:27,424
and then we also would have Broderbund.

896
00:48:28,005 --> 00:48:29,125
And so we were kind of...

897
00:48:30,126 --> 00:48:32,127
we were at different places with both of them.

898
00:48:32,527 --> 00:48:37,070
And so, you know, I think we kept up pretty well.

899
00:48:37,110 --> 00:48:38,471
Took two years, though, totally,

900
00:48:39,051 --> 00:48:40,832
to create the game from start to finish.

901
00:48:41,512 --> 00:48:43,353
Thanks.

902
00:48:43,453 --> 00:48:44,594
I have no idea what time it is.

903
00:48:45,224 --> 00:48:47,064
And if I'm anywhere near...

904
00:48:47,084 --> 00:48:49,465
Okay, good. Okay.

905
00:48:51,145 --> 00:48:52,946
So thanks again for Myst also.

906
00:48:53,126 --> 00:48:55,326
It was also inspirational to me as I was growing up.

907
00:48:55,866 --> 00:48:58,547
So when I played it, it took me about five days,

908
00:48:58,587 --> 00:48:59,247
about an age day.

909
00:48:59,267 --> 00:49:02,548
I had friends that finished it in like one sitting one day.

910
00:49:03,308 --> 00:49:04,308
When you were developing it,

911
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:06,128
did you have any kind of time in mind,

912
00:49:06,168 --> 00:49:08,509
like, oh, you were kind of aiming for, you know,

913
00:49:08,529 --> 00:49:10,689
six, seven, ten, twelve hours of gameplay,

914
00:49:10,709 --> 00:49:12,950
or was it just get through it how you get through it?

915
00:49:13,743 --> 00:49:22,425
You know, I don't think so at all, no. I mean, we, like I said earlier, we were creating this world for ourselves.

916
00:49:23,405 --> 00:49:31,007
There wasn't a lot of games, or none that we had experienced that set a precedent for hours of gameplay.

917
00:49:32,088 --> 00:49:39,190
So, if there had, I'm sure we would have felt like, okay, well we need to give people this many hours of gameplay.

918
00:49:40,078 --> 00:49:43,919
But, so, we were just creating this world that we thought would be really cool and interesting

919
00:49:43,939 --> 00:49:47,200
and fun and it was a fun place for us to experience as we were creating it.

920
00:49:48,380 --> 00:49:49,480
We were living in that world.

921
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:53,501
That's all we'd ever done was live in the worlds we were creating and, and enjoy them

922
00:49:54,041 --> 00:49:56,342
as we created them and then go on to the next world.

923
00:49:57,282 --> 00:50:04,724
And we never, we never for, just even for a little bit thought about like, oh, it's

924
00:50:04,744 --> 00:50:05,904
going to take this many hours.

925
00:50:07,730 --> 00:50:08,810
to experience this.

926
00:50:08,890 --> 00:50:12,213
Now, we watched people play it, then, in our testing.

927
00:50:12,753 --> 00:50:16,016
And so we could see, oh, this takes a while.

928
00:50:16,256 --> 00:50:17,777
This is good. This is... they're enjoying it.

929
00:50:18,138 --> 00:50:19,619
People are hooked for this amount of time.

930
00:50:19,639 --> 00:50:21,020
People enjoy the place.

931
00:50:23,302 --> 00:50:25,944
And they don't get bored. That was the main thing, you know.

932
00:50:27,545 --> 00:50:29,947
So, yeah, but we never intended from the beginning

933
00:50:29,987 --> 00:50:31,748
for it to take a certain amount of hours.

934
00:50:31,768 --> 00:50:34,090
Thank you.

935
00:50:36,011 --> 00:50:36,392
Way in the back.

936
00:50:37,059 --> 00:50:38,300
What are you and your brother doing now?

937
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:39,400
Um...

938
00:50:44,102 --> 00:50:45,583
The Immortal Augustus Gladstone.

939
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:48,664
It's about a guy who...

940
00:50:50,125 --> 00:50:51,526
It's a fictional film.

941
00:50:51,926 --> 00:50:54,167
About a guy who believes he's a vampire.

942
00:50:54,547 --> 00:50:55,508
He believes he's immortal.

943
00:50:56,948 --> 00:50:59,209
It's kind of filmed in a documentary style.

944
00:51:00,350 --> 00:51:00,470
And...

945
00:51:01,726 --> 00:51:03,527
And so this crew follows him around.

946
00:51:03,547 --> 00:51:06,988
He lives in a vacant hotel.

947
00:51:08,028 --> 00:51:09,568
And he's out to find a relative.

948
00:51:09,969 --> 00:51:15,490
It's not necessarily a comedy, believe it or not.

949
00:51:17,691 --> 00:51:20,832
But yeah, so we're going to be, it's probably this summer,

950
00:51:20,932 --> 00:51:22,653
I think, that we'll be coming out.

951
00:51:23,533 --> 00:51:25,153
So look for it.

952
00:51:25,173 --> 00:51:27,154
Thank you.

953
00:51:28,594 --> 00:51:29,275
Thanks for asking.

954
00:51:32,056 --> 00:51:36,597
Hi, Phil Fish, you followed me back on Twitter a couple days ago and that made my week.

955
00:51:37,892 --> 00:51:41,994
I just wanted to say I grew up obsessing on your games for years and years and years.

956
00:51:42,354 --> 00:51:45,735
I beat Riven without looking up any information anywhere. It took me a full year.

957
00:51:47,056 --> 00:51:50,697
The first video games I ever made were Myst clones in black and white HyperCard,

958
00:51:50,757 --> 00:51:53,378
and then I spent years and years and years writing my own age books

959
00:51:53,918 --> 00:51:55,759
and really getting into world building.

960
00:51:55,779 --> 00:51:58,279
And, you know, that's kind of what I do for a living now.

961
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:02,121
And my question is, will you please sign my copy of the Book of Atrus?

962
00:52:02,301 --> 00:52:03,021
Yeah, OK.

963
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:12,973
Yeah, very nice meeting you, very nice meeting you.

964
00:52:13,093 --> 00:52:16,836
It's... I've been so obsessed with your work my entire life.

965
00:52:18,658 --> 00:52:18,978
All right.

966
00:52:19,199 --> 00:52:22,081
This is the one talk I see at GDC this year that's yours.

967
00:52:23,002 --> 00:52:23,503
You want it too?

968
00:52:23,983 --> 00:52:24,884
Yeah, to me.

969
00:52:33,276 --> 00:52:34,276
Alright, there you go.

970
00:52:34,596 --> 00:52:38,738
It's great to meet you. I love your game by the way. I love it.

971
00:52:39,478 --> 00:52:41,059
Oh yeah, oh yeah, it's beautiful.

972
00:52:43,259 --> 00:52:44,100
Alright, um...

973
00:52:45,660 --> 00:52:46,280
Oh, way in the back.

974
00:52:47,101 --> 00:52:47,361
Hello.

975
00:52:48,404 --> 00:52:52,105
I just have a quick question about the protagonist, the person playing the game.

976
00:52:52,345 --> 00:52:58,106
I was always curious if you had in your mind a backstory for how this person acquired the book.

977
00:52:58,246 --> 00:52:59,207
Absolutely not, no.

978
00:53:00,607 --> 00:53:05,768
We were really, we really strongly felt like that the protagonist in the game, or you,

979
00:53:06,288 --> 00:53:08,889
was just whoever was playing the game.

980
00:53:09,189 --> 00:53:14,510
And so, that was, that was really important to us.

981
00:53:14,570 --> 00:53:14,670
Now,

982
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:18,180
You know, it's funny because I know other stories have evolved.

983
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:22,221
Like, it's, this people have said the stranger or something.

984
00:53:22,821 --> 00:53:25,842
But it was, and I don't even know what that means now.

985
00:53:26,342 --> 00:53:31,964
But it's, but yeah, we always felt like, you know, it needs to be

986
00:53:33,384 --> 00:53:35,325
just whoever's playing the game with their...

987
00:53:42,607 --> 00:53:47,110
They need to really feel like they're in this place themselves,

988
00:53:47,430 --> 00:53:51,193
and that it's them in this world,

989
00:53:51,353 --> 00:53:57,177
rather than playing the part of some other person.

990
00:54:00,219 --> 00:54:02,220
In Myst, that was really important to us.

991
00:54:04,121 --> 00:54:04,642
Cool, thank you.

992
00:54:08,504 --> 00:54:08,844
Yes, you.

993
00:54:09,185 --> 00:54:10,205
Okay, hi.

994
00:54:12,590 --> 00:54:14,271
I just have two comments that I'd like to make.

995
00:54:14,391 --> 00:54:20,135
One is that the whole metaphor of writing books

996
00:54:20,255 --> 00:54:22,036
and then going to the worlds that you write

997
00:54:22,557 --> 00:54:28,981
is such a incredible story idea that it holds up so well.

998
00:54:29,001 --> 00:54:31,122
I just wish more people would take that idea

999
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:34,465
and do something with it because it's such a cool idea.

1000
00:54:34,485 --> 00:54:37,106
And second is, you and I have never met,

1001
00:54:37,727 --> 00:54:39,028
but we have spoken on the phone.

1002
00:54:40,313 --> 00:54:42,675
My name's Jack Wall and I wrote the music for the sequels,

1003
00:54:42,755 --> 00:54:43,256
Myst 3 and 4.

1004
00:54:44,537 --> 00:54:49,783
And it gives me great pleasure to give you a huge debt of gratitude

1005
00:54:49,803 --> 00:54:51,044
that I owe you right now.

1006
00:54:51,665 --> 00:54:52,245
Thank you, sir.

1007
00:54:54,427 --> 00:54:54,968
Nice to meet you.

1008
00:54:59,493 --> 00:54:59,873
What about you?

1009
00:55:00,674 --> 00:55:01,435
Okay, in the back.

1010
00:55:02,485 --> 00:55:06,146
Hi. Yeah, I recently dug out my old copy of Mist

1011
00:55:06,466 --> 00:55:08,967
and went through the journal that I had

1012
00:55:09,387 --> 00:55:11,688
with all the notes of solving the puzzles,

1013
00:55:12,008 --> 00:55:14,769
and it was amazing to go through those memories again.

1014
00:55:15,249 --> 00:55:17,910
And so I'm curious, whose idea was it

1015
00:55:17,990 --> 00:55:20,671
to include that in the package, the journal?

1016
00:55:21,631 --> 00:55:23,572
I don't remember whose idea it was

1017
00:55:23,652 --> 00:55:25,752
to include it in the package,

1018
00:55:25,812 --> 00:55:26,853
so I'll just say Broderbund's.

1019
00:55:29,387 --> 00:55:38,674
But I know one of the things we felt strongly about, and it was the idea to not have instruction, an instruction manual.

1020
00:55:39,935 --> 00:55:43,538
And I don't know if newer versions of the game have an instruction manual.

1021
00:55:43,558 --> 00:55:53,847
I know one of the original Mists didn't, because we really felt like, you know, people shouldn't have much instruction when they start playing it.

1022
00:55:53,987 --> 00:55:56,289
And they didn't, and we felt like they didn't need it.

1023
00:55:56,749 --> 00:55:56,929
So...

1024
00:56:00,397 --> 00:56:01,357
But I don't know is the answer.

1025
00:56:01,998 --> 00:56:03,258
Well, it was fantastic, and thank you.

1026
00:56:04,278 --> 00:56:06,058
You've said that your drive for making the game

1027
00:56:06,098 --> 00:56:07,199
was that you wanted to make worlds

1028
00:56:07,239 --> 00:56:09,479
that you would want to do, like, for yourself.

1029
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:12,860
And you've also said that you didn't care

1030
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:13,840
how long the game was,

1031
00:56:14,360 --> 00:56:15,941
and you almost forgot about puzzles

1032
00:56:15,981 --> 00:56:17,841
when preparing this talk, so I guess my question is,

1033
00:56:18,421 --> 00:56:19,501
why was it so essential

1034
00:56:19,541 --> 00:56:20,962
if there'd be puzzles filling the game?

1035
00:56:21,162 --> 00:56:22,502
Oh, it's not essential at all.

1036
00:56:23,862 --> 00:56:24,022
Um...

1037
00:56:25,262 --> 00:56:26,403
But they slow people down,

1038
00:56:26,603 --> 00:56:28,043
and then they get to experience the world

1039
00:56:28,063 --> 00:56:29,563
a little bit more slowly.

1040
00:56:30,258 --> 00:56:35,901
But yeah, I mean, for me, I just love being in the world.

1041
00:56:38,163 --> 00:56:39,143
I do like the story.

1042
00:56:39,463 --> 00:56:42,365
Puzzles, I think, tend to strengthen, they can tend to

1043
00:56:42,405 --> 00:56:43,706
strengthen that story a little bit more.

1044
00:56:44,687 --> 00:56:47,248
If there could be a game, and I'm sure there could be a game

1045
00:56:47,308 --> 00:56:53,612
with no puzzles, and where you could have story somehow, I'm

1046
00:56:53,732 --> 00:56:54,993
sure that could work.

1047
00:56:55,593 --> 00:56:56,614
I know there can be a game with no.

1048
00:56:59,868 --> 00:57:02,131
puzzles and no story and it could work.

1049
00:57:02,251 --> 00:57:04,374
You know, Minecraft does that amazingly well.

1050
00:57:04,394 --> 00:57:06,477
So, yeah.

1051
00:57:07,378 --> 00:57:07,678
I guess.

1052
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,401
I guess we're, I think we're over.

1053
00:57:11,843 --> 00:57:12,424
As timer now?

1054
00:57:14,306 --> 00:57:16,749
I'm afraid this room is on a very rapid turnaround.

1055
00:57:16,769 --> 00:57:17,670
We're going to have to cut here.

1056
00:57:17,730 --> 00:57:18,151
All right. Cool.

1057
00:57:18,711 --> 00:57:19,653
Thanks so much for coming.
