1
00:00:04,464 --> 00:00:15,430
This talk is called Believable Humans, and I'm Mike Mumbaugh. I'm the Director of the PlayStation Visual Arts Service Group, and this is my colleague, Dr. Mark Sagar, Director of Laboratory for Animate Technologies.

2
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,152
I'm going to start with an interesting thing when I was putting together this talk.

3
00:00:21,533 --> 00:00:21,553
I...

4
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:25,190
There's a couple quotes in here, but this one's particularly interesting to me.

5
00:00:26,691 --> 00:00:29,492
You know, you can connect the dots looking... you can't connect the dots looking forward,

6
00:00:29,512 --> 00:00:30,932
you can only connect them looking backwards.

7
00:00:30,952 --> 00:00:34,073
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

8
00:00:34,093 --> 00:00:40,414
And this talk really is about my experience in the last 12 years in kind of the digital human space.

9
00:00:41,035 --> 00:00:45,956
And Mark's had even more experience with that, but my experience starts at...

10
00:00:47,216 --> 00:00:49,177
Oh, it's not... the talk's not on. Hang on, hang on.

11
00:00:49,417 --> 00:00:50,257
We didn't actually put the...

12
00:00:52,516 --> 00:00:55,757
That'll be better for you if it actually shows.

13
00:00:55,797 --> 00:00:56,277
There we go.

14
00:00:56,297 --> 00:00:58,637
At least we didn't get too far down.

15
00:00:59,677 --> 00:01:00,118
There's that.

16
00:01:00,958 --> 00:01:01,138
Okay.

17
00:01:02,678 --> 00:01:04,399
So again, my story starts,

18
00:01:05,979 --> 00:01:08,239
at least in digital character space, around 2003.

19
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:13,000
And that's when I first met Mark Sagar.

20
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:15,121
I was working on the Polar Express,

21
00:01:15,161 --> 00:01:16,521
and he was working on Spider-Man.

22
00:01:18,181 --> 00:01:19,742
I joined PlayStation in 2007.

23
00:01:22,589 --> 00:01:26,510
And that's when I started working on character stuff there, cinematic stuff.

24
00:01:27,331 --> 00:01:30,852
Since I've been at PlayStation, we've worked on about 45 different titles.

25
00:01:31,692 --> 00:01:35,673
And we do art and cinematic support for worldwide studios,

26
00:01:35,733 --> 00:01:38,414
focusing on digital characters, faces and animation.

27
00:01:40,235 --> 00:01:40,395
So...

28
00:01:44,336 --> 00:01:46,097
I'm going to show you here if you can see.

29
00:01:46,697 --> 00:01:53,721
So since I joined PlayStation, we've done roughly about 14 animated feature,

30
00:01:53,761 --> 00:01:57,163
with the equivalent of about 14 animated feature films in six years,

31
00:01:57,683 --> 00:01:59,044
but it's been in the video game space.

32
00:02:02,118 --> 00:02:03,578
Going back to Mark, just so that he,

33
00:02:03,678 --> 00:02:05,539
so when we do this talk, we're gonna transition,

34
00:02:05,559 --> 00:02:07,500
I wanna do the introduction so he doesn't have to do that.

35
00:02:08,641 --> 00:02:10,482
He's a PhD in engineering and specializes

36
00:02:10,522 --> 00:02:11,903
in performance facial capture

37
00:02:13,323 --> 00:02:15,304
and advanced rendering techniques

38
00:02:16,325 --> 00:02:18,006
and also facial motion capture.

39
00:02:18,286 --> 00:02:20,987
He's got two Academy Awards,

40
00:02:21,207 --> 00:02:24,749
one for his work at Imageworks on Spider-Man 2

41
00:02:25,029 --> 00:02:29,371
and the other for his work at Weta on King Kong and Avatar.

42
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:36,495
So, I'm going to start talking now about some of the stuff from PlayStation

43
00:02:36,716 --> 00:02:40,879
and some of the story of kind of where we were, how we got there,

44
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,461
and then kind of where we're going.

45
00:02:43,061 --> 00:02:44,302
And I want to start with The Last of Us.

46
00:02:44,322 --> 00:02:45,843
We're going to talk about it really briefly.

47
00:02:47,445 --> 00:02:51,208
How many of you guys went to Damon Shelton from Naughty Dog's mocap talk?

48
00:02:51,989 --> 00:02:57,855
Okay, cool. I'm not going to talk a lot about it, but one of the important things for me in this talk,

49
00:02:58,356 --> 00:03:05,363
especially in terms of believable characters, I think this is a defining moment for video games.

50
00:03:06,124 --> 00:03:10,589
And this is a scene that we did in San Diego with my team.

51
00:03:11,109 --> 00:03:14,152
We helped create the characters and we did.

52
00:03:14,893 --> 00:03:18,195
a lot of, actually this entire scene of animation,

53
00:03:18,295 --> 00:03:19,716
for The Last of Us, we did about 80%

54
00:03:20,896 --> 00:03:22,938
of the cinematic animation for the title.

55
00:03:24,018 --> 00:03:25,559
So hopefully this will play.

56
00:03:25,579 --> 00:03:35,905
Is there audio?

57
00:03:38,326 --> 00:03:38,606
Hang on.

58
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:44,661
How many of you guys know this scene?

59
00:03:45,822 --> 00:03:47,043
Oh, this won't work without audio.

60
00:03:48,264 --> 00:03:49,925
David or whatever from the old...

61
00:03:50,746 --> 00:03:51,307
Sorry, y'all.

62
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:53,729
Let's see if this works now.

63
00:03:58,473 --> 00:03:58,873
Yes, sir.

64
00:04:00,295 --> 00:04:01,716
Somebody, we've just been through hell.

65
00:04:02,457 --> 00:04:02,977
We just need...

66
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:19,841
Oh no.

67
00:04:22,382 --> 00:04:22,743
Sarah.

68
00:04:22,763 --> 00:04:24,924
Move your hands, baby.

69
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,705
I know, baby. I know.

70
00:04:26,745 --> 00:04:26,946
God.

71
00:04:27,206 --> 00:04:32,449
Listen to me. I know this one.

72
00:04:32,489 --> 00:04:35,171
You're gonna be okay, baby. Stay with me.

73
00:04:35,331 --> 00:04:37,793
Alright. I'm gonna pick you up.

74
00:04:37,813 --> 00:04:39,695
I know, baby. I know you're in this.

75
00:04:40,135 --> 00:04:42,036
Come on, baby. Please.

76
00:04:42,436 --> 00:04:43,397
I know, baby. I know.

77
00:04:43,477 --> 00:04:43,757
Sarah.

78
00:04:55,116 --> 00:04:56,958
Don't do this to me, please.

79
00:04:56,978 --> 00:05:01,441
Don't do this to me.

80
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:02,022
No.

81
00:05:02,702 --> 00:05:03,163
No.

82
00:05:03,803 --> 00:05:04,764
No.

83
00:05:04,844 --> 00:05:04,884
No.

84
00:05:05,124 --> 00:05:05,224
No.

85
00:05:05,244 --> 00:05:05,344
No.

86
00:05:05,484 --> 00:05:08,507
No.

87
00:05:10,809 --> 00:05:10,969
No.

88
00:05:11,049 --> 00:05:11,990
No.

89
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:12,670
Please.

90
00:05:15,773 --> 00:05:15,913
Please.

91
00:05:15,933 --> 00:05:16,233
Please.

92
00:05:16,253 --> 00:05:16,393
Please.

93
00:05:16,433 --> 00:05:16,593
Please.

94
00:05:16,633 --> 00:05:16,813
Please.

95
00:05:16,833 --> 00:05:16,954
Please.

96
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:17,514
All right.

97
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:19,295
We're back.

98
00:05:19,355 --> 00:05:21,257
So, sorry to start in such a downer.

99
00:05:22,772 --> 00:05:27,756
But this is a pretty important moment for video games, I think.

100
00:05:28,657 --> 00:05:31,360
You know, Empire Called a Gaming Citizen Kane moment,

101
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,802
we've heard a couple of things like that before.

102
00:05:33,842 --> 00:05:36,544
But this really has a lot of emotional impact.

103
00:05:36,564 --> 00:05:38,506
I've watched this scene, we worked on it,

104
00:05:38,526 --> 00:05:39,646
and I have a hard time watching it.

105
00:05:40,347 --> 00:05:43,210
And, you know, I've grown up with video games since,

106
00:05:44,591 --> 00:05:46,632
you know, I was a kid, five years old,

107
00:05:46,672 --> 00:05:47,713
so really grown up with them.

108
00:05:48,514 --> 00:05:48,674
And...

109
00:05:49,595 --> 00:05:53,457
Maybe it's because I have two daughters of my own that I look at this and it's really hard to watch.

110
00:05:53,938 --> 00:05:56,279
But I think it's more than that. I think there's empathy.

111
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:59,061
I think we can all relate to the characters here.

112
00:05:59,501 --> 00:06:00,722
We can all relate to loss.

113
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:08,067
And I wondered that if we looked at this 20 years ago,

114
00:06:08,087 --> 00:06:09,768
if we did the same thing 20 years ago,

115
00:06:10,529 --> 00:06:14,611
and it looked, you know, in the old 8-bit kind of graphic stuff,

116
00:06:16,012 --> 00:06:17,733
could we get the same level of...

117
00:06:19,057 --> 00:06:42,722
empathy. So it's the same scene, right? It's the same writing.

118
00:06:43,842 --> 00:06:45,922
And that's how we would have done it and that's the same

119
00:06:45,962 --> 00:06:48,303
music. But

120
00:06:49,151 --> 00:06:55,956
I'm not crying. Why? Right? It's just, it's an interesting thing to look at because

121
00:06:56,696 --> 00:07:00,299
it's not just the context. It really is something else.

122
00:07:01,197 --> 00:07:05,039
So these games now are getting incredibly complicated,

123
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,861
and they're very challenging, just

124
00:07:06,901 --> 00:07:08,662
like making anything great, right?

125
00:07:09,142 --> 00:07:10,243
It's about the quality of it.

126
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,704
And quality is never an accident.

127
00:07:11,724 --> 00:07:14,026
It's always a result of high intention, sincere effort,

128
00:07:14,126 --> 00:07:16,288
intelligent direction, and skillful execution.

129
00:07:16,308 --> 00:07:19,270
It represents the wise choice of many alternatives.

130
00:07:20,230 --> 00:07:23,333
And this particular title is a great example

131
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:25,594
of skillful execution, right?

132
00:07:25,634 --> 00:07:27,856
At every level, it's got relatable characters,

133
00:07:27,936 --> 00:07:30,158
outstanding casting direction and pacing.

134
00:07:30,934 --> 00:07:31,934
And that's really important.

135
00:07:31,954 --> 00:07:33,195
It doesn't matter what kind of entertainment

136
00:07:33,215 --> 00:07:33,856
we're talking about.

137
00:07:34,236 --> 00:07:35,577
It's using performance capture,

138
00:07:35,638 --> 00:07:36,859
which is really, really important.

139
00:07:37,882 --> 00:07:39,622
They've made smart visual choices.

140
00:07:39,682 --> 00:07:42,543
Some of the choices are related to the power of the machine

141
00:07:43,124 --> 00:07:44,404
and what can be achieved.

142
00:07:44,444 --> 00:07:47,686
But some of it really is about the choice

143
00:07:47,826 --> 00:07:50,627
just in terms of the style that they want to show.

144
00:07:51,147 --> 00:07:53,788
There's amazing music and sound design.

145
00:07:54,088 --> 00:07:57,169
And the truth is that Naughty Dog

146
00:07:57,229 --> 00:08:01,451
is one of the most advanced developers in the planet

147
00:08:01,511 --> 00:08:04,052
in terms of the way they think about collaboration.

148
00:08:04,912 --> 00:08:10,958
they handed us one of their best emotionally impactful scenes to deliver for them.

149
00:08:11,398 --> 00:08:16,343
And we had the same emotional investment in the game as they did.

150
00:08:17,364 --> 00:08:22,729
So, game and movies, at least in terms of digital characters,

151
00:08:22,869 --> 00:08:24,791
in my opinion, fall into three different categories.

152
00:08:25,491 --> 00:08:27,973
Realistic, hyper-real, and animated.

153
00:08:29,114 --> 00:08:29,855
And these are kind of...

154
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,161
you know, some game examples that are falling into these categories.

155
00:08:34,441 --> 00:08:38,362
This is not an opinion of where success lies.

156
00:08:38,422 --> 00:08:40,743
It's just an opinion of what they're striving to achieve

157
00:08:42,123 --> 00:08:45,924
and the category in which they kind of fall into.

158
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,245
And for the films that really tried to do digital characters well,

159
00:08:50,505 --> 00:08:52,305
this is where they fell into as well.

160
00:08:54,406 --> 00:08:54,566
So...

161
00:08:55,971 --> 00:08:57,972
I told you I started Imageworks in 2003.

162
00:08:58,052 --> 00:09:00,814
One of the last films I worked there was Beowulf.

163
00:09:01,334 --> 00:09:04,576
Beowulf has a significant place in digital character history.

164
00:09:05,216 --> 00:09:07,277
It's one of the few films that attempt

165
00:09:07,317 --> 00:09:10,579
to make a realistic, believable character, human character,

166
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,701
in a completely digital world.

167
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,082
But it struggled to find an audience

168
00:09:16,162 --> 00:09:19,264
because it struggled to find a reason to exist.

169
00:09:20,364 --> 00:09:22,185
You could shoot Beowulf physically,

170
00:09:22,225 --> 00:09:23,406
and why did you need it digitally?

171
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:25,995
And the other issue is this, right?

172
00:09:27,356 --> 00:09:28,096
The uncanny valley.

173
00:09:28,116 --> 00:09:29,517
I haven't heard this term in a little while

174
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,978
since I'm out of film, and it was a real big deal in 2003

175
00:09:32,458 --> 00:09:33,598
till 2007.

176
00:09:34,939 --> 00:09:36,900
But for some reason, we don't really

177
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:38,581
care about it that much in games.

178
00:09:38,601 --> 00:09:39,501
She's no hack of the wolf.

179
00:09:40,501 --> 00:09:40,621
So?

180
00:09:40,641 --> 00:09:43,703
You both know that.

181
00:09:43,723 --> 00:09:44,183
But answer me.

182
00:09:44,883 --> 00:09:46,364
Did you kill her?

183
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:57,581
Would I have been able to escape her had I not?

184
00:10:00,783 --> 00:10:04,544
Visually, this movie still has a lot of relevance.

185
00:10:04,644 --> 00:10:06,705
There's a lot of digital character stuff

186
00:10:06,725 --> 00:10:07,485
we would like to do.

187
00:10:07,585 --> 00:10:09,086
Sticky lips, for instance.

188
00:10:10,727 --> 00:10:12,928
The shaders and the lighting, a lot of stuff

189
00:10:12,968 --> 00:10:14,828
is still pretty advanced even by today's standards.

190
00:10:14,868 --> 00:10:19,030
The issues are that you've got a fabricated digital character,

191
00:10:19,090 --> 00:10:20,691
Beowulf, who's not based on anyone.

192
00:10:21,391 --> 00:10:24,995
acting up against realistic digital double characters like Anthony Hopkins

193
00:10:25,055 --> 00:10:28,538
and you know Anthony Hopkins and so when you see Anthony Hopkins as a digital character

194
00:10:28,999 --> 00:10:32,222
you know something's wrong if it's not exactly right.

195
00:10:32,983 --> 00:10:37,527
And what's interesting to me is if this movie had been done completely

196
00:10:37,908 --> 00:10:39,709
with with characters that you didn't.

197
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:45,376
know were based on real life characters. Would you have accepted it more? Would it have been easier to watch? Maybe.

198
00:10:45,876 --> 00:10:49,400
I still go back and watch the movie and even though I'm too close to the movie I still

199
00:10:49,821 --> 00:10:54,926
think it's easier and I can still watch Beowulf and don't see as creepy

200
00:10:54,946 --> 00:10:59,652
you know, I don't feel that creepiness but I look at Anthony Hopkins and I still get the same feeling everybody else does.

201
00:11:00,372 --> 00:11:00,613
And uh...

202
00:11:02,745 --> 00:11:07,647
We also were, you know, this digital character thing was a real high focus at Imageworks at that time.

203
00:11:07,667 --> 00:11:12,168
And it was actually interesting because Mark was working on the image-based rendering stuff

204
00:11:12,508 --> 00:11:16,829
for Spider-Man, which ended up being a demo for PlayStation 3, if you guys,

205
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,190
yeah, PlayStation 3, if you remember, during the transition.

206
00:11:21,290 --> 00:11:24,991
So, the timing of the film, it was released in November 16th in 2007.

207
00:11:27,995 --> 00:11:32,478
And the commentary, you know, obviously the reviews were mixed, and the commentary is kind of

208
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:36,460
pretty clear. You can go, but I'm not going to read all the stuff, because we're already behind schedule.

209
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,322
But I'm going to tell you one down at the bottom, it says,

210
00:11:38,362 --> 00:11:43,505
Beowulf's a solidly gorgeous at times, borderline, stolid piece of Tolkien with a joystick mythology.

211
00:11:43,525 --> 00:11:47,227
That's a fascinating commentary. Joystick mythology. It's referencing video games.

212
00:11:47,467 --> 00:11:52,110
It's, it's, it's relating, these critics are relating this to games.

213
00:11:52,990 --> 00:11:55,351
Even though games at that time couldn't touch this visually.

214
00:11:56,773 --> 00:12:00,420
In November 19th, three days later, Uncharted 1 came out.

215
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:02,884
Much better reception, right?

216
00:12:03,779 --> 00:12:07,840
This was a game that used a lot of similar ideas.

217
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,001
Performance capture, no, it was using motion capture with animated faces.

218
00:12:12,302 --> 00:12:14,782
But the idea of doing digital characters was there.

219
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:19,824
And there was a clear change, a clear sort of chapter shift.

220
00:12:20,004 --> 00:12:24,925
I started in PlayStation, this is coincidentally, one of the dots backwards theory,

221
00:12:25,665 --> 00:12:26,666
on November 19th, 2007.

222
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:31,047
And that was the release day of Uncharted 1.

223
00:12:32,781 --> 00:12:34,902
but also three days after the release of Beowulf.

224
00:12:35,322 --> 00:12:38,784
So for me personally, this was a closing one chapter, right?

225
00:12:38,904 --> 00:12:39,844
And then opening another.

226
00:12:40,305 --> 00:12:44,107
And this was the first thing that I personally

227
00:12:44,127 --> 00:12:47,068
worked on with my team, a lot of who came down

228
00:12:47,148 --> 00:12:48,649
from Imageworks with me.

229
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:51,050
Fully acting.

230
00:12:51,070 --> 00:12:51,910
It's a two person job.

231
00:12:51,930 --> 00:12:52,311
No, no, no.

232
00:12:53,071 --> 00:12:53,851
Three, actually.

233
00:12:53,871 --> 00:12:54,832
This is Uncharted 2.

234
00:12:55,232 --> 00:12:56,653
Speak of the devil, here she comes now.

235
00:12:59,174 --> 00:12:59,894
Chloe Fraser.

236
00:13:01,335 --> 00:13:01,495
Nate.

237
00:13:02,004 --> 00:13:03,645
Drake, Nathan, Drake.

238
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:06,127
Hello, Harry.

239
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,709
Chloe is one of the best drivers in the business.

240
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,530
She'll take good care of us.

241
00:13:11,430 --> 00:13:15,233
So, Uncharted 2 had a very different reception, right?

242
00:13:15,593 --> 00:13:24,319
This is one of the most, um, highest rated games on PlayStation 3

243
00:13:25,460 --> 00:13:28,582
and is one of the best examples of cinematic games.

244
00:13:29,639 --> 00:13:33,501
And you can see even in the commentary again, they're even saying you don't need to make a movie of this.

245
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:34,981
There's a game.

246
00:13:35,682 --> 00:13:37,342
It's better than you're gonna see in any movie.

247
00:13:38,423 --> 00:13:40,724
Coincidentally, that same year this came out.

248
00:13:41,804 --> 00:13:45,726
And it's interesting Metacritic score, and I'm, this is not about Metacritic, and I'm not a fan of Metacritic,

249
00:13:45,746 --> 00:13:48,807
but it's a good reflection of this sort of view of the time.

250
00:13:49,187 --> 00:13:53,309
But it's interesting to see that Avatar, billion dollar franchise, probably two billion dollars,

251
00:13:53,349 --> 00:13:56,710
at this point it's an 83 Metacritic score. That's a B- isn't it?

252
00:13:57,730 --> 00:14:01,571
fascinating, but it's incredibly, it's an incredible,

253
00:14:02,871 --> 00:14:05,072
it's a landmark film, visually,

254
00:14:05,292 --> 00:14:08,492
and they made very smart choices to avoid digital humans

255
00:14:08,532 --> 00:14:10,673
because again, they had moved on at that point,

256
00:14:11,253 --> 00:14:13,174
and they had found better ways to do,

257
00:14:13,194 --> 00:14:15,394
I mean, the techniques were still very similar

258
00:14:15,434 --> 00:14:19,195
to the ones we used, but the output was very different.

259
00:14:20,295 --> 00:14:23,036
So the, looking at the evolution of the digital character,

260
00:14:23,076 --> 00:14:23,776
it's kind of funny, we,

261
00:14:25,225 --> 00:14:28,069
kind of gave up in film.

262
00:14:28,290 --> 00:14:29,912
We'd solved the problems of the monkeys

263
00:14:30,693 --> 00:14:33,036
and the fantasy characters and the aliens,

264
00:14:33,077 --> 00:14:34,478
but we kind of stopped here.

265
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:40,287
And we moved on, but that's the starting point for games.

266
00:14:40,327 --> 00:14:42,209
That's where games really picked up.

267
00:14:43,515 --> 00:14:47,297
So around that time, we started doing more advanced techniques.

268
00:14:47,357 --> 00:14:51,500
And around 2007 to 2009, doing more advanced scanning

269
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:52,521
techniques at PlayStation.

270
00:14:53,201 --> 00:14:58,765
And we scanned Dennis Hopper, which should show up here,

271
00:14:59,365 --> 00:14:59,766
hopefully.

272
00:15:00,226 --> 00:15:00,386
No?

273
00:15:01,727 --> 00:15:02,067
Here you go.

274
00:15:02,908 --> 00:15:06,289
This was a title that never came out, but we were in 2007, 2008,

275
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:10,991
starting to look at this digital double technique.

276
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:14,433
The game was cancelled, not for any reason having to do with digital doubles,

277
00:15:14,453 --> 00:15:19,355
but it certainly was an interesting time to even be exploring that.

278
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:28,142
Now we're seeing even more of that with Kevin Spacey in Advanced Warfare, but again we're still, the verdict's out.

279
00:15:28,222 --> 00:15:31,765
It's interesting because the whole Uncanny Valley thing isn't really being discussed.

280
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,606
People aren't too freaked out about it in games.

281
00:15:34,865 --> 00:15:41,408
But the technology we were using for scanning went into titles like SoCom4.

282
00:15:41,528 --> 00:15:47,410
And when we released Uncharted 3, it set a new quality bar for our titles

283
00:15:48,070 --> 00:15:52,492
and the expectation for all of our titles that needed digital characters needed to be at that level.

284
00:15:53,132 --> 00:15:57,277
And frankly, SoCom4, when I was there, what the developers were doing was not at that level.

285
00:15:57,297 --> 00:15:59,359
What you see on the left is what they had completed.

286
00:16:00,179 --> 00:16:04,944
And on the right was when we entered in, we completely revamped their characters

287
00:16:05,224 --> 00:16:12,612
with no topology changes, no higher vertex counts, same texture, resolution.

288
00:16:13,273 --> 00:16:15,575
It was just a technique change, honestly.

289
00:16:17,216 --> 00:16:23,138
And it was a challenge to kind of convince them at the time that this was worth it, but the reality was that

290
00:16:23,938 --> 00:16:30,340
It PlayStation 3 toward the end of that life cycle the guy in the left just wouldn't have wouldn't have held up

291
00:16:31,383 --> 00:16:35,005
So not only do we have to kind of do scans,

292
00:16:35,065 --> 00:16:38,167
but we ended up doing, we started doing fax-based blend

293
00:16:38,187 --> 00:16:42,250
shapes, because their engine could support blend shapes.

294
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,851
We were able to get 60 blend shapes, which

295
00:16:43,871 --> 00:16:46,853
is pretty good for fax, although we weren't doing facial capture.

296
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:49,414
And we still use the same animation techniques.

297
00:16:50,495 --> 00:16:53,797
And ended up getting reasonably believable characters

298
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,779
for what would be digital doubles,

299
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:58,440
but not digital doubles that anybody would recognize.

300
00:17:00,624 --> 00:17:04,625
We started seeing neck bulge, and we

301
00:17:04,645 --> 00:17:05,926
were able to get wrinkle maps in.

302
00:17:08,907 --> 00:17:11,308
And we started using more advanced cinematic techniques.

303
00:17:13,608 --> 00:17:16,189
We also started characterizing, started pushing away

304
00:17:16,229 --> 00:17:19,891
from doing exact scans towards kind of hyper-stylistically

305
00:17:19,911 --> 00:17:23,672
moving to get to more palatable visual characters.

306
00:17:23,712 --> 00:17:26,633
We also played at this time, LA Noire had come out,

307
00:17:27,093 --> 00:17:30,234
played with some of the ideas of the video-based scanning, which

308
00:17:32,538 --> 00:17:34,559
look like it was going to be very disruptive at the time.

309
00:17:35,199 --> 00:17:36,780
This is also a title that didn't come out.

310
00:17:36,820 --> 00:17:37,641
We did some testing.

311
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,162
Eyeline stuff really doesn't work.

312
00:17:41,343 --> 00:17:43,704
And it works in a sense that if you have a viewer

313
00:17:43,764 --> 00:17:45,965
and you're using a fourth wall where it's talking directly

314
00:17:46,005 --> 00:17:47,806
to you, it works because the eyeline is at you.

315
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:49,848
But beyond that, it really doesn't work.

316
00:17:50,548 --> 00:17:52,869
But it was interesting just to see some of the tests.

317
00:17:52,909 --> 00:17:55,611
We had done some tests to see how it would hold up

318
00:17:55,811 --> 00:17:57,952
with characters like Kratos.

319
00:17:59,177 --> 00:18:00,458
Could we put Kratos in a game?

320
00:18:00,619 --> 00:18:01,719
This was not for a game.

321
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,561
It was just testing to see could it be done.

322
00:18:03,581 --> 00:18:07,605
This is not anything other than an actor in makeup,

323
00:18:07,665 --> 00:18:10,307
but it was interesting to see what it would do.

324
00:18:10,327 --> 00:18:11,288
And again, this is PlayStation 3.

325
00:18:12,404 --> 00:18:16,145
So at the end of PlayStation 3, we knew that PlayStation 4 was going to be a higher fidelity expectation.

326
00:18:16,185 --> 00:18:19,926
We were going to have to do a lot more, and we need a lot better technology,

327
00:18:20,106 --> 00:18:23,127
and the costs were rising, and we needed to create efficiency.

328
00:18:23,167 --> 00:18:28,649
So I contacted Mark, saying we need better facial capture solutions than what we have.

329
00:18:29,849 --> 00:18:32,390
And everybody, all the studios are talking about building one,

330
00:18:32,570 --> 00:18:36,131
or using off-the-shelf stuff, which doesn't seem to give us the results we're looking for.

331
00:18:36,811 --> 00:18:42,014
So I called him, you know, he was at Weta at the time, at least I thought, and when I contacted him

332
00:18:42,774 --> 00:18:49,258
he'd actually left Weta a week earlier and started a laboratory for digital characters working on AI.

333
00:18:50,158 --> 00:18:54,881
And we talked about building a commercial partnership immediately.

334
00:18:55,798 --> 00:18:59,519
One week after he started, we started talking, doing a commercial partnership and working on

335
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:04,139
the technology advancements, all the stuff we'd learned over the years,

336
00:19:04,559 --> 00:19:10,121
building the technology and character advancements, the techniques,

337
00:19:10,241 --> 00:19:14,381
all the stuff that we'd learned over the years, using the performance capture techniques

338
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:18,782
and the scanning techniques to build a system which we call Parrot.

339
00:19:19,482 --> 00:19:22,203
And this was literally our first test out of this system.

340
00:19:26,097 --> 00:19:27,778
Beginning incision at upper abdomen.

341
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,181
Exposed internal organs seem to produce

342
00:19:36,201 --> 00:19:37,421
an ultraviolet glow.

343
00:19:38,462 --> 00:19:39,802
This was again, not for a title,

344
00:19:39,862 --> 00:19:41,623
this was just testing to get the tech

345
00:19:42,023 --> 00:19:44,143
to see how far we could go with it.

346
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:45,324
When I asked Marcus,

347
00:19:45,344 --> 00:19:46,264
I think I hit bone or something.

348
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:52,306
What, in your opinion, is the next gen in facial?

349
00:19:53,127 --> 00:19:57,170
He's been doing this since 1997, so if anybody knows about this, Mark knows about it.

350
00:19:57,450 --> 00:19:58,831
So I said, what are you looking at next?

351
00:19:59,271 --> 00:20:05,356
Where everybody else is looking at is a lot of stuff we talked about a decade ago and honestly did on movies a decade ago.

352
00:20:05,716 --> 00:20:09,259
So, if I'm going to build something and we want to spend a lot of money and time on it,

353
00:20:09,339 --> 00:20:15,203
we want to do something that's more advanced and can honestly break some of the barriers that we hit.

354
00:20:15,904 --> 00:20:19,466
And interestingly enough, he told me that at that time,

355
00:20:19,486 --> 00:20:21,607
he said, oh, I'm actually working on stuff for games.

356
00:20:21,667 --> 00:20:23,108
I'm more interested in the game space.

357
00:20:23,168 --> 00:20:25,309
We kind of solved King Kong, and we did Avatar,

358
00:20:25,349 --> 00:20:26,130
and that was really cool.

359
00:20:26,150 --> 00:20:29,051
But I'm really interested in actually building stuff

360
00:20:29,432 --> 00:20:34,515
behind the face and using AI to actually drive

361
00:20:34,575 --> 00:20:35,335
facial animation.

362
00:20:36,276 --> 00:20:38,037
So that's where we're going to lead to.

363
00:20:38,117 --> 00:20:40,978
Really quickly, though, most recently, the stuff

364
00:20:40,998 --> 00:20:41,559
that we've built.

365
00:20:42,480 --> 00:20:45,342
We revamped all of our photogrammetric scanners

366
00:20:45,882 --> 00:20:50,745
to build some incredibly high detailed scans, some

367
00:20:50,765 --> 00:20:55,128
of the highest you can possibly get out of photogrammetric scans

368
00:20:55,168 --> 00:20:56,049
for facial right now.

369
00:20:56,309 --> 00:20:57,590
And we're also working on bodies.

370
00:20:58,130 --> 00:21:00,611
And it was done with a partnership with Sony Electronics

371
00:21:00,792 --> 00:21:02,012
because we have cameras.

372
00:21:02,553 --> 00:21:03,794
We have a really good camera division

373
00:21:03,814 --> 00:21:06,355
that we didn't have access to at the time.

374
00:21:06,415 --> 00:21:08,376
And we had to build custom software, which

375
00:21:08,396 --> 00:21:09,697
is kind of a pain in the ass.

376
00:21:09,717 --> 00:21:11,258
But we did that, and it paid off.

377
00:21:12,016 --> 00:21:15,420
And we were able to immediately put that work into the order.

378
00:21:17,022 --> 00:21:20,186
And so the order is a culmination

379
00:21:20,226 --> 00:21:22,488
of a lot of techniques, some of all

380
00:21:22,508 --> 00:21:24,491
of the years of these things in one place,

381
00:21:24,591 --> 00:21:26,453
using the best performance capture techniques,

382
00:21:26,533 --> 00:21:27,935
using the best scanning techniques.

383
00:21:31,633 --> 00:21:34,916
We still had stuff to learn, but I think if you look at what

384
00:21:35,476 --> 00:21:39,499
Ready at Dawn had achieved, coming from a PSP developer

385
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,743
to a PS4 developer, with no generation of knowledge

386
00:21:44,843 --> 00:21:46,324
between, it's remarkable.

387
00:21:51,263 --> 00:21:55,348
And they're actually setting the bar in the industry

388
00:21:55,368 --> 00:21:56,049
in terms of visuals.

389
00:21:56,109 --> 00:21:58,752
They're not getting recognized, I believe,

390
00:21:59,353 --> 00:22:00,534
as fairly as they should.

391
00:22:01,155 --> 00:22:03,418
And there's certainly an interesting commentary

392
00:22:03,458 --> 00:22:06,141
going on that's kind of a little bit of a rebound effect.

393
00:22:06,181 --> 00:22:07,402
They're getting too close to film,

394
00:22:07,462 --> 00:22:09,385
and now games are sort of pushing back,

395
00:22:09,425 --> 00:22:10,967
saying that's too film-like.

396
00:22:11,647 --> 00:22:15,630
And it's sort of ironic because games have been a safe haven

397
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,352
for innovation, especially in the digital character space.

398
00:22:18,612 --> 00:22:21,934
Games like LA Noire, even though there were flaws

399
00:22:21,974 --> 00:22:23,756
and the disconnect between the body and the eyes

400
00:22:23,796 --> 00:22:26,497
were, frankly, very, very difficult to look at,

401
00:22:27,018 --> 00:22:29,219
but people really were OK.

402
00:22:30,060 --> 00:22:31,421
And the critics were thrilled.

403
00:22:32,422 --> 00:22:36,945
And the issue is that we are getting too close to film.

404
00:22:37,045 --> 00:22:39,807
And for some reason, now we're getting pushback.

405
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:40,547
It's interesting.

406
00:22:41,739 --> 00:22:44,701
So now I'm moving on, and then we're

407
00:22:44,721 --> 00:22:45,682
going to transition to Mars.

408
00:22:45,722 --> 00:22:48,044
I'm going to close out with our work on Uncharted 4.

409
00:22:48,265 --> 00:22:50,427
I don't have a lot to show you here because we're still

410
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:50,907
working on it.

411
00:22:52,549 --> 00:22:52,729
But.

412
00:22:53,976 --> 00:22:55,757
When we go back to the types of techniques

413
00:22:55,777 --> 00:22:58,159
we were using on Beowulf, this was very interesting.

414
00:22:58,499 --> 00:23:02,102
We did a base digital scan of Ray Winson who played Beowulf.

415
00:23:02,122 --> 00:23:04,704
That couldn't be really utilized in any way.

416
00:23:04,944 --> 00:23:07,746
The scan was only used for reference

417
00:23:08,267 --> 00:23:11,429
and only reference for how his face moved.

418
00:23:11,929 --> 00:23:15,292
And ultimately, mocap drove the poses

419
00:23:15,332 --> 00:23:16,653
that we would actually model from.

420
00:23:17,574 --> 00:23:21,917
So it's a remarkable difference from today for where we are with Uncharted 4.

421
00:23:22,237 --> 00:23:27,942
We're actually scanning an actor that's got similar facial structure to the character we want to look at.

422
00:23:27,982 --> 00:23:29,443
It's Nathan Drake. It's not an actor.

423
00:23:30,024 --> 00:23:35,949
It's not based on an actor, but these facial shapes have resemblances to the character we want.

424
00:23:35,989 --> 00:23:41,653
And we're using these blend shapes to influence the rig directly,

425
00:23:42,474 --> 00:23:46,097
which thereby make the animation a lot more...

426
00:23:48,199 --> 00:23:51,082
much higher fidelity and a lot higher accuracy and also

427
00:23:52,503 --> 00:23:55,566
just in, you know, much better overall.

428
00:23:55,606 --> 00:23:56,787
Here's an interesting example.

429
00:23:56,827 --> 00:24:00,170
This is the blend shapes we used about 70 on SOCOM

430
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:02,332
and this is about 180 on the order and we're about 1,000.

431
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:11,154
on Uncharted 4. So you can see the fidelity. Now how all those blend shapes, they won't all be

432
00:24:11,374 --> 00:24:16,217
used in the engine, they're going to drive a rig, but we're using what we call micro-expressions

433
00:24:16,277 --> 00:24:20,180
to define all these really, really core shapes that are really important to get the kind of

434
00:24:20,220 --> 00:24:24,983
fidelity we need. And you know the visual target, this is Beowulf in 2007, you know, and this is

435
00:24:25,023 --> 00:24:27,945
Uncharted 4 in real time in 2015.

436
00:24:34,049 --> 00:24:38,753
And this is the rig just showing you kind of a range of motion.

437
00:24:44,719 --> 00:24:46,881
I can't really show you any of the songs or animations.

438
00:24:46,941 --> 00:24:49,263
We are using all of the techniques,

439
00:24:50,144 --> 00:24:52,486
the scanning techniques, the motion capture techniques,

440
00:24:52,586 --> 00:24:55,469
all the animation techniques that we've learned along the way.

441
00:25:04,834 --> 00:25:11,764
And finally, right now, our biggest challenge in this area is a lack of domain experts.

442
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:16,871
For me, you know, I've worked in the industry between games and film for...

443
00:25:18,478 --> 00:25:20,798
for over a decade, and I know very few people that

444
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,779
can build these kinds of systems, Mark's one of the few.

445
00:25:26,040 --> 00:25:27,640
The scale and complexity is enormous,

446
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,381
and the artists and tech artists are highly specialized.

447
00:25:31,401 --> 00:25:34,982
They have to completely understand how the face moves,

448
00:25:35,202 --> 00:25:37,242
and there's no training for that, really,

449
00:25:37,282 --> 00:25:38,983
and there's no schools that are focusing on that.

450
00:25:39,043 --> 00:25:40,643
So it's really hard to find blend shape artists.

451
00:25:40,683 --> 00:25:42,983
It's really hard to find animators with that focus.

452
00:25:43,504 --> 00:25:44,924
We need better technology and automation,

453
00:25:44,944 --> 00:25:46,664
otherwise it's going to be impossible to scale.

454
00:25:47,044 --> 00:25:48,085
That's where our focus is.

455
00:25:48,825 --> 00:25:52,252
you know, and we just need more face experts.

456
00:25:54,355 --> 00:25:56,359
So, I'll leave you with a quote,

457
00:25:56,399 --> 00:25:58,322
the reasonable man adapts himself to the world,

458
00:25:58,342 --> 00:26:00,987
the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.

459
00:26:01,633 --> 00:26:04,075
Thereby all progress depends on the unreasonable man.

460
00:26:04,335 --> 00:26:07,537
I'm going to now pass it on to the most unreasonable man I know,

461
00:26:08,097 --> 00:26:12,239
Mark Sagar, who has some really incredible technology to show you in terms of,

462
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,961
again, this is not being utilized right now,

463
00:26:15,141 --> 00:26:18,383
but this is stuff that is going to be coming.

464
00:26:19,083 --> 00:26:22,144
and when we start figuring out how to use this stuff, it's going to change things.

465
00:26:22,724 --> 00:26:25,325
So, I'm going to drop a few emails here.

466
00:26:26,265 --> 00:26:30,066
That's mine. Feel free to contact me. I'm sorry, you know, it wasn't highly technical,

467
00:26:30,106 --> 00:26:32,147
but if you have any technical questions, I'll happen to answer them.

468
00:26:32,527 --> 00:26:35,548
It was along with Kareem Ashoud, who is the...

469
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:39,371
one of the most important influencers on the art side,

470
00:26:39,411 --> 00:26:41,473
if not the most important influencer

471
00:26:42,034 --> 00:26:44,256
on titles like The Order and Uncharted 4.

472
00:26:44,796 --> 00:26:47,458
And Tom Bland, who's been the animation director

473
00:26:47,939 --> 00:26:50,221
on our side for these titles since Uncharted 2.

474
00:26:50,541 --> 00:26:52,983
So these are the guys to hit up and ask questions about.

475
00:26:53,484 --> 00:26:54,685
Thank you, and I'm passing on to Mark.

476
00:26:54,705 --> 00:26:55,806
Okay, thank you very much.

477
00:26:56,246 --> 00:27:01,651
Thank you.

478
00:27:01,671 --> 00:27:01,851
Thank you.

479
00:27:01,891 --> 00:27:02,091
Thank you.

480
00:27:02,111 --> 00:27:02,392
Thank you.

481
00:27:02,412 --> 00:27:02,632
Thank you.

482
00:27:02,652 --> 00:27:02,872
Thank you.

483
00:27:02,892 --> 00:27:03,072
Thank you.

484
00:27:03,092 --> 00:27:03,272
Thank you.

485
00:27:03,292 --> 00:27:03,472
Thank you.

486
00:27:03,492 --> 00:27:03,673
Thank you.

487
00:27:03,693 --> 00:27:03,873
Thank you.

488
00:27:05,320 --> 00:27:07,543
So it's coming through this jack here.

489
00:27:08,284 --> 00:27:08,725
Yeah, great.

490
00:27:08,785 --> 00:27:09,085
Thank you.

491
00:27:09,726 --> 00:27:14,413
OK, so thank you very much, Mike.

492
00:27:14,453 --> 00:27:15,734
Thank you for the unreasonable.

493
00:27:17,237 --> 00:27:18,637
characterization, that's fine.

494
00:27:18,957 --> 00:27:21,979
So this is going to take that to an extreme now.

495
00:27:23,139 --> 00:27:27,101
So one of the things which interests me about digital

496
00:27:27,141 --> 00:27:29,742
characters was, so this is going to be a slightly

497
00:27:29,762 --> 00:27:33,804
different tack on the whole creating human aspect.

498
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:36,285
This is really a bit more about creating behavior.

499
00:27:36,905 --> 00:27:39,047
So how do you create the inner life of a character?

500
00:27:39,428 --> 00:27:44,272
Now the thing is which Mike's talked about in a lot of detail is the face.

501
00:27:44,332 --> 00:27:46,954
And the face is our primary means of communication and expression.

502
00:27:46,994 --> 00:27:51,618
So it's critical that you get the expressions right because that communicates the information

503
00:27:51,678 --> 00:27:53,720
that's telling you what the character's mental state is.

504
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:56,202
And the face's identity has to be right.

505
00:27:56,222 --> 00:27:57,263
So that's like the um...

506
00:27:58,195 --> 00:28:02,779
Anthony Hopkins example. The face is your signature. It's very important to get right.

507
00:28:03,379 --> 00:28:08,983
So this is a film that we made in 1999, a short film. It was in the SIGGRAPH Electronic

508
00:28:09,003 --> 00:28:13,526
Theatre. And for this I wanted to digitally age an old woman. This is ten years before

509
00:28:13,586 --> 00:28:20,150
Benjamin Button. And what we're doing here is sort of creating a character. It's a digital

510
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:24,253
character that we want to basically make you think about what she's thinking.

511
00:28:25,489 --> 00:28:28,012
So she's just supposed to be remembering things.

512
00:28:28,072 --> 00:28:31,716
We're trying to make you think about the mental world

513
00:28:31,796 --> 00:28:33,358
of a character that doesn't exist.

514
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,702
And that really got me thinking about how that's done.

515
00:28:37,223 --> 00:28:39,286
And so a lot of the films that I worked on,

516
00:28:39,406 --> 00:28:41,428
like especially King Kong and Avatar,

517
00:28:41,749 --> 00:28:42,770
were about how do you...

518
00:28:43,551 --> 00:28:47,493
make a digital character appear like a conscious thinking being.

519
00:28:48,253 --> 00:28:50,254
And, you know, that's basically...

520
00:28:50,894 --> 00:28:54,496
you have to pay a lot of attention to what's going on in the face, most subtle things.

521
00:28:54,516 --> 00:28:56,077
Like, characters like King Kong don't speak,

522
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:59,238
so the emotional weight of that is coming through the most subtle movements.

523
00:29:00,078 --> 00:29:02,419
And that really got me thinking about,

524
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:08,402
okay, well, what are the symphonies of our facial movement, how are they composed?

525
00:29:08,622 --> 00:29:11,624
Because that's the music of the face, which is coming across.

526
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:12,584
And...

527
00:29:13,961 --> 00:29:19,084
Our behavior, what's expressed on the face, is actually the result of a very complex,

528
00:29:19,424 --> 00:29:20,765
multi-scale system.

529
00:29:21,325 --> 00:29:26,369
It depends on how you feel at the time, whether you had lunch, what your thoughts are, what

530
00:29:26,409 --> 00:29:30,551
your history is, how you express that, and then somebody else's reaction.

531
00:29:31,051 --> 00:29:35,814
So the whole believability of a character in a scene depends on...

532
00:29:36,837 --> 00:29:43,236
the context. Does everything tie together? So, to be unreasonable we thought, can we

533
00:29:43,276 --> 00:29:44,039
actually model this?

534
00:29:45,365 --> 00:29:48,448
So can we actually create models which integrate these different elements?

535
00:29:49,268 --> 00:29:53,191
And so what we're doing in my lab is creating autonomous animation.

536
00:29:53,251 --> 00:29:57,454
So we're basically simulating faces and simulating brains and putting these together.

537
00:29:58,035 --> 00:30:02,758
And we're trying to do it in real time, but the motivation there is that for a computer

538
00:30:02,778 --> 00:30:07,441
to really simulate a human face behaviouring, you have to simulate its brain and body too.

539
00:30:09,108 --> 00:30:11,950
So here's an overview of our architecture.

540
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,471
So we're basically creating a system

541
00:30:13,531 --> 00:30:15,252
to build artificial nervous systems.

542
00:30:15,832 --> 00:30:18,594
So what it does is it interconnects senses and effectors

543
00:30:19,154 --> 00:30:22,756
with expressive displays, but through a brain.

544
00:30:22,996 --> 00:30:25,157
And so the brain will do multimodal association.

545
00:30:25,217 --> 00:30:26,298
It evaluates things.

546
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,319
In robotics, this would create movement.

547
00:30:28,699 --> 00:30:31,321
We're really working on how does the computer

548
00:30:31,381 --> 00:30:32,721
convey how it feels?

549
00:30:32,781 --> 00:30:33,882
How does it express itself?

550
00:30:34,142 --> 00:30:35,723
And then how does that connect into a loop

551
00:30:35,863 --> 00:30:37,084
to people that it's interacting with?

552
00:30:37,804 --> 00:30:42,048
So, basically I set up this lab just when Mike had called

553
00:30:42,088 --> 00:30:45,431
to do exactly this, because this is where I wanted to go.

554
00:30:45,511 --> 00:30:48,093
I really, ultimately I want to create a conscious computer.

555
00:30:48,113 --> 00:30:50,455
It might be impossible, but it's a really fun challenge.

556
00:30:50,976 --> 00:30:53,778
So, really, so that's the unreasonable bit.

557
00:30:53,958 --> 00:30:57,201
So what we're doing is we're combining bioengineering,

558
00:30:57,241 --> 00:30:59,203
neuroscience, sensing, and computer graphics,

559
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:01,585
and putting these things together to basically embody

560
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:04,807
models of the brain with faces that you can interact with.

561
00:31:05,508 --> 00:31:06,609
There's two reasons for this.

562
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:09,272
One of it is to basically explore theoretical models

563
00:31:09,312 --> 00:31:09,992
of brain function.

564
00:31:10,333 --> 00:31:12,215
The other thing is there's a human-computer interface

565
00:31:12,255 --> 00:31:12,815
technology.

566
00:31:13,196 --> 00:31:15,658
And so games fit somewhere in between that.

567
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:19,262
And so the way we look at the face is as an instrument.

568
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,604
And so what we're doing is really building a synthesizer.

569
00:31:22,457 --> 00:31:26,242
And so we want to look at what's the information that we're conveying?

570
00:31:26,382 --> 00:31:30,167
You know, how does the facial information get across if you're really boiling it down?

571
00:31:30,187 --> 00:31:32,671
And, you know, ultimately it's muscle activation.

572
00:31:33,112 --> 00:31:36,897
So, those are the notes, the musical notes of the face, if you like.

573
00:31:38,090 --> 00:31:41,813
So Paul Ekman in the 70s basically came up with a system

574
00:31:41,853 --> 00:31:44,716
to sort of encode these different muscle groups.

575
00:31:44,756 --> 00:31:47,558
So that's been used a lot in film and games.

576
00:31:48,379 --> 00:31:50,961
And so one of the things though is it's really

577
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:52,042
how to generate these shapes.

578
00:31:52,082 --> 00:31:54,304
So this is a particular thing I was looking at is

579
00:31:55,725 --> 00:31:58,985
creating a biomechanical model of the face so that we could automatically generate these

580
00:31:59,005 --> 00:31:59,465
blin shapes.

581
00:31:59,505 --> 00:32:04,066
So what you're looking at now is a physics-based simulation of a human face.

582
00:32:04,106 --> 00:32:05,147
It's a finite element model.

583
00:32:05,327 --> 00:32:06,767
So it's my face because I was a guinea pig.

584
00:32:07,107 --> 00:32:12,568
But basically we now digitally activate these muscles and it's creating the shapes.

585
00:32:12,868 --> 00:32:16,349
These aren't being sculpted, they're being actually created by a physics simulation.

586
00:32:16,849 --> 00:32:19,730
Now what we're going to do is just start activating all the muscles randomly.

587
00:32:21,402 --> 00:32:24,103
And the physics simulation is doing all the flesh movements,

588
00:32:24,123 --> 00:32:25,383
doing all the collision detection.

589
00:32:25,763 --> 00:32:29,324
And this only works if you get the anatomy really

590
00:32:29,804 --> 00:32:31,224
in a lot of detail and really right

591
00:32:31,264 --> 00:32:33,045
with all the multiple complex material

592
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,245
properties and sliding properties of skin and so forth.

593
00:32:35,725 --> 00:32:37,266
So it's not an easy job.

594
00:32:37,306 --> 00:32:40,287
But this was sort of the stuff that I was doing in the past.

595
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:42,147
And what I really wanted to do was

596
00:32:42,207 --> 00:32:43,967
to create the control system for this.

597
00:32:44,487 --> 00:32:46,088
So what we're really doing in my lab

598
00:32:46,148 --> 00:32:47,888
is essentially creating nerve animation.

599
00:32:47,988 --> 00:32:51,229
So how do we create animation which animates the nerves?

600
00:32:51,589 --> 00:32:52,650
which drive the face.

601
00:32:53,230 --> 00:32:56,891
So if we do this, and I believe that it's ultimately

602
00:32:56,931 --> 00:32:59,292
going to be necessary to do this because this is what

603
00:32:59,352 --> 00:33:01,653
conveys the subtlety of what a face can really do.

604
00:33:02,053 --> 00:33:04,494
So people have strokes, for example, half a face

605
00:33:04,514 --> 00:33:06,895
will be paralyzed, but they'll smile naturally

606
00:33:06,935 --> 00:33:08,755
because the emotional system driving the face

607
00:33:08,795 --> 00:33:10,116
is different from the cognitive system.

608
00:33:10,136 --> 00:33:11,216
So there's a whole bunch of things like that.

609
00:33:13,127 --> 00:33:16,970
The meat of the stuff that we're doing is what we call brain-based computing.

610
00:33:17,070 --> 00:33:18,711
So it's neurobehavioral models.

611
00:33:18,771 --> 00:33:24,275
So how do you create a digital character to really want to do something?

612
00:33:24,315 --> 00:33:25,656
It has to have its own in life.

613
00:33:26,076 --> 00:33:30,179
So for example, so what we're doing is essentially neurobehavioral animation.

614
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,060
So if my blood sugar level is low...

615
00:33:33,205 --> 00:33:37,788
I'll get hungry and then I'll start seeking food and that motivates my behaviour.

616
00:33:38,228 --> 00:33:41,289
If I get blocked in getting my food, I'll start getting angry and so forth.

617
00:33:41,729 --> 00:33:43,570
So these are core models.

618
00:33:43,650 --> 00:33:47,912
It's like we're trying to model what motivates a human and actually put that in a computer.

619
00:33:48,533 --> 00:33:53,015
And at the same time, we're also doing models of the emotional systems, attention systems

620
00:33:53,075 --> 00:33:54,035
and also learning.

621
00:33:54,215 --> 00:33:55,556
How do these systems learn?

622
00:33:55,596 --> 00:33:57,897
Because we want them to learn in the same way that people do.

623
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,078
And also how do they interact socially?

624
00:34:01,174 --> 00:34:05,737
So we build all kinds of different models, like for example, this is a model of basal

625
00:34:05,757 --> 00:34:10,540
ganglia, which is a crocodile as a giant basal ganglia, so this basically does habitual behaviour

626
00:34:10,580 --> 00:34:12,402
and learning, reinforcement learning, things like that.

627
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:15,944
And we also want to look at what's actually driving the emotions, so we've actually been

628
00:34:15,984 --> 00:34:17,846
building models of the emotional systems.

629
00:34:17,906 --> 00:34:23,630
Now they're very controversial, but we look at the physiology, so we build physiology

630
00:34:23,790 --> 00:34:25,511
models of these emotional systems.

631
00:34:26,192 --> 00:34:28,953
And then we start looking into, like, how does the brain learn?

632
00:34:29,613 --> 00:34:31,774
And, you know, this is a sort of simple example of...

633
00:34:32,075 --> 00:34:33,535
The brain self-organizes a lot.

634
00:34:33,555 --> 00:34:35,816
You just expose it to new information, it just learns new stuff.

635
00:34:35,856 --> 00:34:37,817
So I would hit a Go button, here's a bunch of random colors.

636
00:34:38,458 --> 00:34:39,658
It's just self-organizing.

637
00:34:39,878 --> 00:34:41,899
That could be words, it could be colors that you're seeing,

638
00:34:41,919 --> 00:34:43,240
part of your visual system learning,

639
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,401
or it could be words that you're learning for the first time,

640
00:34:45,421 --> 00:34:46,021
and that sort of stuff.

641
00:34:46,562 --> 00:34:50,683
And you build hierarchies of these types of things and you start getting essentially nature's

642
00:34:50,723 --> 00:34:55,165
equivalent of some of the things which, like Google, are doing with things like deep learning

643
00:34:55,205 --> 00:34:55,766
and so forth.

644
00:34:55,806 --> 00:34:56,906
But it's all the same type of stuff.

645
00:34:56,946 --> 00:34:58,407
We're taking a biological approach.

646
00:34:59,067 --> 00:35:00,888
So we also look at memory.

647
00:35:00,908 --> 00:35:03,369
You know, how does a computer remember its experiences?

648
00:35:03,389 --> 00:35:06,150
So we're building basically models of the memory system.

649
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:11,592
So this is just an old test which is basically the computer imagining a sequence of numbers.

650
00:35:11,652 --> 00:35:12,953
It knows what's going to happen next.

651
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,442
So this is like a computer imagining something.

652
00:35:17,762 --> 00:35:19,884
So then we start looking around.

653
00:35:19,964 --> 00:35:21,765
So there's been lots of interesting

654
00:35:21,805 --> 00:35:23,767
computational neuroscience and cognitive science

655
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:25,869
models out there, but what happens if we put them

656
00:35:25,929 --> 00:35:27,070
together and actually embody them?

657
00:35:27,110 --> 00:35:28,050
And how do you even do that?

658
00:35:28,711 --> 00:35:30,933
And so to do that, we've basically built

659
00:35:31,033 --> 00:35:32,474
essentially a Lego system.

660
00:35:33,735 --> 00:35:37,136
It's really a brain Lego system, but because of trademark stuff, we've basically called

661
00:35:37,156 --> 00:35:37,896
it brain language.

662
00:35:38,456 --> 00:35:43,577
And what it does is it combines neural networks, sensors, graphics, all kinds of stuff, so

663
00:35:43,597 --> 00:35:46,258
you can just plug it all together and build very complex systems.

664
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,098
So I'll show you a really simple system.

665
00:35:48,459 --> 00:35:51,739
So what we're looking at here is a very simple circuit down the right.

666
00:35:51,779 --> 00:35:53,420
This is like the knee reflexor circuit.

667
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:57,041
So basically we'll sort of connect a few things together, whack the knee.

668
00:35:58,019 --> 00:36:00,061
And so we're simulating the spinal cord circuit,

669
00:36:00,081 --> 00:36:01,543
which gives you a knee reflex.

670
00:36:01,843 --> 00:36:03,344
And then you can kind of see all the parameters.

671
00:36:03,685 --> 00:36:06,047
So what our system does is it's a continuously

672
00:36:06,107 --> 00:36:07,088
integrating system.

673
00:36:07,468 --> 00:36:10,411
So you can basically see what each neuron's doing,

674
00:36:10,691 --> 00:36:11,512
you know, live.

675
00:36:11,532 --> 00:36:13,514
And you can investigate that while the model's running.

676
00:36:13,914 --> 00:36:14,014
Now.

677
00:36:15,015 --> 00:36:18,999
Basically to give you an example of you know how to put all these things together

678
00:36:19,239 --> 00:36:26,125
we've we've started off as simple as we can on a human which is a baby, so this is called baby X and

679
00:36:26,906 --> 00:36:28,467
So baby X. Here's the real baby

680
00:36:29,728 --> 00:36:32,190
So this is kind of like a baby capture now

681
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:39,056
Here's a real baby for the very first having solid food for the very first time so the baby's having a fundamentally new experience

682
00:36:39,076 --> 00:36:43,000
I think it's a whoa moment

683
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:44,974
Now we want the computer to do that too.

684
00:36:45,514 --> 00:36:48,996
So anyway, we start basically building up 3D models of the baby.

685
00:36:49,677 --> 00:36:52,939
Had to do that when my wife was asleep, so with the scanner, because I would have gotten

686
00:36:52,959 --> 00:36:53,159
trouble.

687
00:36:53,539 --> 00:36:57,502
And so then we start building a biomechanical model of the baby.

688
00:36:58,651 --> 00:37:00,853
and activate the biomechanical baby's muscles,

689
00:37:00,873 --> 00:37:02,554
because you can't get real babies to do what you want,

690
00:37:02,614 --> 00:37:03,674
but you can simulate them.

691
00:37:04,615 --> 00:37:06,596
And then we start putting in a bunch

692
00:37:06,617 --> 00:37:08,158
of the different types of brain systems, which

693
00:37:08,198 --> 00:37:10,559
are driving the various aspects of the baby.

694
00:37:10,639 --> 00:37:14,822
So I'll just quit out of the presentation for a second

695
00:37:15,182 --> 00:37:18,265
and fire up a quick demo here.

696
00:37:21,162 --> 00:37:27,766
Now, what's actually happening now is the brain is compiling itself.

697
00:37:28,166 --> 00:37:29,727
It's literally compiling at run time.

698
00:37:30,207 --> 00:37:35,390
So it's kind of like a Python or something like that, but it's basically building all the connections and things like that.

699
00:37:36,411 --> 00:37:38,132
So, here she is.

700
00:37:38,632 --> 00:37:40,093
Okay, so she can see in here.

701
00:37:40,473 --> 00:37:43,695
So if I make a loud noise, she'll get a fright.

702
00:37:44,096 --> 00:37:45,937
We can kind of zoom in.

703
00:37:46,617 --> 00:37:47,978
Let's see if I do this.

704
00:37:47,998 --> 00:37:49,359
We've just changed all the view keys.

705
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:52,027
right around like that.

706
00:37:52,047 --> 00:37:54,688
So, you know, she's watching me and reacting to me.

707
00:37:55,068 --> 00:37:56,988
We can kind of take a look at what she can actually see.

708
00:37:57,709 --> 00:37:59,009
So you can see me here.

709
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:00,849
So I'm looking at her and I smile at her.

710
00:38:00,889 --> 00:38:01,349
Hey, sweetheart.

711
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,310
Now she's not copying my expression.

712
00:38:04,370 --> 00:38:06,611
She's actually getting feel-good chemicals

713
00:38:06,651 --> 00:38:07,411
and then smiling.

714
00:38:07,991 --> 00:38:10,011
Now, she's constantly learning.

715
00:38:10,211 --> 00:38:11,292
So she's learning online.

716
00:38:11,332 --> 00:38:13,592
So if I do, like you've heard of Pavlov's dog.

717
00:38:13,692 --> 00:38:15,733
So if I do a, and I'll see if we can hear this

718
00:38:15,773 --> 00:38:16,513
from the microphone.

719
00:38:18,302 --> 00:38:19,343
Can everybody hear that?

720
00:38:19,363 --> 00:38:22,944
So, okay, that's called a conditioned stimulus.

721
00:38:23,124 --> 00:38:25,285
So now I'm gonna pair it, and I'm gonna go,

722
00:38:25,465 --> 00:38:28,367
okay, let's see, and, hey, sweetheart.

723
00:38:29,047 --> 00:38:31,348
Hey, you like the bell, yeah, the bell is awesome.

724
00:38:31,808 --> 00:38:33,749
Okay, so now I've kind of paired that,

725
00:38:33,769 --> 00:38:35,350
and let's see what happens now when I do the bell.

726
00:38:38,038 --> 00:38:42,601
She's sort of learning her context, so she's basically learning online all the time.

727
00:38:42,621 --> 00:38:46,083
Okay, so then let's jump through to a few other things.

728
00:38:46,443 --> 00:38:51,426
And so you can see, what we're looking at up here is basically a bunch of different

729
00:38:51,446 --> 00:38:52,227
neuromodulators.

730
00:38:52,267 --> 00:38:55,489
So she's got oxytocin, she's got dopamine, she's got all these different types of things

731
00:38:55,509 --> 00:38:56,029
driving her.

732
00:38:56,489 --> 00:39:01,072
Now, if I abandon her, I'm just going to sort of be a bit cruel here and sort of like, hide

733
00:39:01,092 --> 00:39:01,392
from her.

734
00:39:04,448 --> 00:39:06,310
She's going to sort of start wondering where I've gone.

735
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:09,052
She knows I've gone off somewhere to the left.

736
00:39:09,613 --> 00:39:11,775
But if you start watching where the arrow pointer is,

737
00:39:11,795 --> 00:39:13,237
she's going to start getting stressed out.

738
00:39:13,297 --> 00:39:14,958
We're actually setting off her stress system.

739
00:39:17,701 --> 00:39:19,383
So, by the way, all of our animations

740
00:39:19,443 --> 00:39:21,865
are completely generated by neural network circuits.

741
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,841
and those are driving the particular muscle.

742
00:39:25,861 --> 00:39:27,182
So she's getting actually upset now.

743
00:39:27,202 --> 00:39:29,543
We've got her cortisol's gone up, she's stressed out.

744
00:39:29,903 --> 00:39:31,064
Hey, sweetheart, it's okay.

745
00:39:31,324 --> 00:39:32,905
And she's listening to my voice and everything.

746
00:39:32,945 --> 00:39:34,226
So I say, hey, don't cry, it's okay.

747
00:39:34,606 --> 00:39:37,008
Okay, so now we're gonna be a bit more cool

748
00:39:37,048 --> 00:39:38,209
and actually remove her face.

749
00:39:38,769 --> 00:39:38,909
So...

750
00:39:40,030 --> 00:39:41,932
And so you can see what's actually driving behind it.

751
00:39:42,232 --> 00:39:43,774
So literally, what you're looking at now

752
00:39:44,314 --> 00:39:47,477
are the circuits actually driving the muscles,

753
00:39:47,557 --> 00:39:48,298
driving the face.

754
00:39:48,338 --> 00:39:50,821
So you can see the eyes, you can see the neural networks,

755
00:39:50,981 --> 00:39:52,722
you can see the nuclei and the brain stem,

756
00:39:52,742 --> 00:39:54,084
which are driving the eye muscles.

757
00:39:54,444 --> 00:39:56,166
And as I'm moving around, it's just kind of looking.

758
00:39:56,646 --> 00:39:59,009
So now what I'm gonna do is kind of like a, whoops.

759
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,091
Changed all my view keys.

760
00:40:02,052 --> 00:40:05,394
So we've got this whole model of the brain, you can go around, we've put the things in

761
00:40:05,414 --> 00:40:06,595
the appropriate anatomical place.

762
00:40:06,615 --> 00:40:10,138
So the idea here is we've put our neural networks in the place where they really are.

763
00:40:10,698 --> 00:40:15,162
And now we're going to sort of, we can zoom into the brainstem and do stuff, we can even

764
00:40:15,222 --> 00:40:16,703
do other sorts of things here.

765
00:40:16,763 --> 00:40:21,047
So because the model's based on these computational neuroscience models, we can do all kinds of

766
00:40:21,087 --> 00:40:21,327
things.

767
00:40:21,367 --> 00:40:25,150
Like if I do this, I'm actually going to, I don't know if you can see this green light

768
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,752
pumping up there, but what I'm doing is I'm actually like...

769
00:40:28,392 --> 00:40:32,955
overriding the sort of, there's a whole thing called a thalmic cortical loop, which is a cortex

770
00:40:33,015 --> 00:40:37,317
that sends stuff down to the thalamus, and that's a feedback loop, and if that builds up you actually

771
00:40:37,337 --> 00:40:40,819
do something, and if it shuts down you don't. So what we're kind of simulating now is actually

772
00:40:40,859 --> 00:40:45,461
Huntington's disease. So this is a case where people basically, all the muscles are moving

773
00:40:45,501 --> 00:40:50,323
too much, we can do the opposite and kill off those cells, and now it shuts down this feedback

774
00:40:50,363 --> 00:40:54,105
loop. This is Parkinson's disease, people want to move but they can't, but we can build these

775
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:54,926
things into the model.

776
00:40:55,526 --> 00:40:59,948
And now we're coming out of the model, and so we can even, I'll even show you the effect externally.

777
00:40:59,988 --> 00:41:02,268
So I'm now going to bump up the dopamine, so watch her pupils.

778
00:41:04,049 --> 00:41:06,310
So this is essentially like putting the baby on amphetamines.

779
00:41:06,810 --> 00:41:10,431
So it's like, you can do all these types of things, but it actually drives the behaviour

780
00:41:10,451 --> 00:41:13,332
of the model, it changes its learning abilities and all kinds of things.

781
00:41:14,135 --> 00:41:16,196
Now, let's just jump to another thing.

782
00:41:16,857 --> 00:41:18,738
And we've been teaching her to read,

783
00:41:18,858 --> 00:41:19,938
so I'm gonna show you,

784
00:41:19,958 --> 00:41:21,559
this is her little first words book.

785
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:23,800
So I'm from New Zealand,

786
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,221
so I'm gonna show you a sheep.

787
00:41:25,621 --> 00:41:27,161
Okay, right, okay sweetheart.

788
00:41:27,182 --> 00:41:28,002
What's this, what's this?

789
00:41:32,624 --> 00:41:32,844
Sheep.

790
00:41:33,124 --> 00:41:33,725
Good girl.

791
00:41:33,745 --> 00:41:36,266
Okay, and we'll see if she can read a word.

792
00:41:36,466 --> 00:41:37,807
Okay, what's this, what's this say?

793
00:41:39,127 --> 00:41:39,527
What's that?

794
00:41:41,988 --> 00:41:42,569
What's that say?

795
00:41:45,348 --> 00:41:46,168
Come on, what's that?

796
00:41:48,029 --> 00:41:50,690
Hey, look at me. Pay attention. Pay attention.

797
00:41:53,391 --> 00:41:55,371
It might be the light in it.

798
00:41:56,872 --> 00:41:58,732
Yeah, that could be. I'll show her some other word.

799
00:41:58,792 --> 00:42:00,133
Okay, hey, what's this? What's this?

800
00:42:02,874 --> 00:42:03,534
Good girl.

801
00:42:03,974 --> 00:42:06,975
Okay, so she's hearing me and getting rewards and all kinds of things.

802
00:42:07,015 --> 00:42:08,736
So she's basically can...

803
00:42:10,316 --> 00:42:10,737
Hey, what's this?

804
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:13,896
Good girl.

805
00:42:14,256 --> 00:42:15,637
Okay, now I'll show you some things

806
00:42:15,677 --> 00:42:17,979
which I can't, which take longer to train.

807
00:42:18,759 --> 00:42:20,180
These are things which might take an hour

808
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:21,001
or something to train.

809
00:42:21,041 --> 00:42:23,322
So this is learning to imitate a face.

810
00:42:23,383 --> 00:42:25,784
So what's happening here is the baby

811
00:42:25,924 --> 00:42:28,186
is now gonna just do random facial movements.

812
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:32,129
And I'm copying here.

813
00:42:32,169 --> 00:42:33,590
This is what parents do to kids.

814
00:42:33,910 --> 00:42:35,531
So we're basically trying to build a computer

815
00:42:35,571 --> 00:42:37,293
which you can teach like a child.

816
00:42:39,321 --> 00:42:43,228
Now as time passes, the baby starts learning those associations.

817
00:42:43,248 --> 00:42:46,053
Now she's copying me.

818
00:42:46,353 --> 00:42:46,734
Good girl.

819
00:42:47,415 --> 00:42:48,497
Good girl.

820
00:42:48,657 --> 00:42:49,779
Yeah, clever.

821
00:42:49,799 --> 00:42:50,981
Okay, let's do that again.

822
00:42:51,544 --> 00:42:52,185
Okay, you ready?

823
00:42:52,205 --> 00:42:56,568
So we combine, all the expressions are generated through neural networks.

824
00:42:56,928 --> 00:42:57,968
It's everything synthetic.

825
00:42:58,008 --> 00:43:01,691
Now this is what we've done is we've connected her brain to the bat in the game Pong.

826
00:43:02,111 --> 00:43:05,433
She doesn't know this, this is just like a baby sees its arm for the first time type

827
00:43:05,453 --> 00:43:06,074
thing playing around.

828
00:43:06,454 --> 00:43:08,295
But she gets a reward every time she hits the bat.

829
00:43:08,676 --> 00:43:12,078
So she's actually going to teach herself to play Pong.

830
00:43:12,098 --> 00:43:13,459
So over time, this takes about an hour.

831
00:43:17,582 --> 00:43:19,243
Now she's got mental control over the bat.

832
00:43:21,150 --> 00:43:23,812
So that's a sort of example of the baby.

833
00:43:23,852 --> 00:43:25,854
So it's basically creating a character which is embedded

834
00:43:25,874 --> 00:43:27,315
in the world, which is learning from the world,

835
00:43:27,335 --> 00:43:28,416
which is reacting to it.

836
00:43:28,796 --> 00:43:32,478
So if we kind of move forward a little, hang on.

837
00:43:34,360 --> 00:43:36,441
Yeah, so this character, so I'll just show you

838
00:43:36,481 --> 00:43:37,942
an adult model that we're working on.

839
00:43:38,002 --> 00:43:39,423
So we're also, we don't just build babies,

840
00:43:39,443 --> 00:43:40,424
we're also building adults.

841
00:43:40,484 --> 00:43:41,665
So this is called Ziza.

842
00:43:42,065 --> 00:43:45,047
So she's a work in progress, so I'm just gonna fire her up.

843
00:43:46,869 --> 00:43:49,491
Now, let's see, where is this?

844
00:43:52,676 --> 00:43:58,918
Okay, so Zyza's basically first job is gonna be in the airport.

845
00:43:58,958 --> 00:44:02,440
It doesn't require too much intelligence, but she's gonna be like, check you in and stuff.

846
00:44:02,860 --> 00:44:08,642
So, but anyway, she's just being built at the moment,

847
00:44:08,722 --> 00:44:11,884
so I'll just show you a bit of stuff so you can see where we're at with it.

848
00:44:12,504 --> 00:44:15,645
So, there she is. I don't know if you can see it. Yep.

849
00:44:15,785 --> 00:44:19,507
And then we can, let's see, zoom in on her.

850
00:44:22,657 --> 00:44:23,877
Let's see, wrong button.

851
00:44:25,817 --> 00:44:27,878
So she's, if we look at the types of things,

852
00:44:27,918 --> 00:44:29,418
she's got all kinds of controls.

853
00:44:29,478 --> 00:44:31,279
Now I'm just gonna find my mouse, it's gone.

854
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:32,259
Oh shit.

855
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:37,720
I've lost my mouse.

856
00:44:39,460 --> 00:44:40,621
Oh there it is, it's over there.

857
00:44:41,981 --> 00:44:43,281
This is weird, okay.

858
00:44:44,742 --> 00:44:47,422
This, oh no, yeah, there.

859
00:44:47,442 --> 00:44:50,283
And then, I'm just trying to get this control panel.

860
00:44:50,583 --> 00:44:51,943
The mouse I can't see on the.

861
00:44:53,150 --> 00:44:53,590
There we go.

862
00:44:54,010 --> 00:44:56,931
Okay, so she can do various behaviors.

863
00:44:56,971 --> 00:44:58,611
So we'll just get her saying something.

864
00:44:58,671 --> 00:44:59,112
Hello.

865
00:45:00,772 --> 00:45:01,632
How can I help you?

866
00:45:03,253 --> 00:45:03,833
Thank you.

867
00:45:04,773 --> 00:45:06,194
So all the time she's reacting to you,

868
00:45:06,214 --> 00:45:08,875
she's actually watching customers and attracting you.

869
00:45:09,075 --> 00:45:11,836
These are just sort of canned things that she says.

870
00:45:12,116 --> 00:45:12,816
I understand.

871
00:45:14,136 --> 00:45:14,297
Yes.

872
00:45:16,957 --> 00:45:23,860
Now, as she's doing all this sort of stuff, what we can do is we can start like messing around with her, you know, we can change her expression, you know.

873
00:45:24,821 --> 00:45:27,122
Changes the whole sort of feel of what she's doing.

874
00:45:27,582 --> 00:45:30,944
Like if I do something like, you know, like a bit disgusted, you know.

875
00:45:31,444 --> 00:45:37,006
Sort of, so we can do all these things live. Now this is just literally changing sort of expressions and stuff like that.

876
00:45:37,026 --> 00:45:41,408
But one of the other things that we can do is we can now start activating her own sort of...

877
00:45:42,809 --> 00:45:43,910
Emotional neural networks.

878
00:45:43,950 --> 00:45:47,593
So if we start doing things like this, if I start saying something...

879
00:45:47,873 --> 00:45:49,094
I'll just wait for her to finish.

880
00:45:49,114 --> 00:45:53,197
Okay.

881
00:45:53,418 --> 00:45:56,520
Okay, there we go.

882
00:45:56,740 --> 00:46:00,183
So now if we now start to say something sort of disappointing happens to her.

883
00:46:00,943 --> 00:46:03,946
So these are all being generated in real time and they'll never be the same.

884
00:46:04,626 --> 00:46:07,068
And basically, you know, these things still...

885
00:46:07,328 --> 00:46:09,110
So she starts feeling bad about it.

886
00:46:11,523 --> 00:46:13,204
until she just completely shuts down.

887
00:46:14,805 --> 00:46:15,846
She's completely depressed.

888
00:46:16,086 --> 00:46:19,808
And now we can do other sorts of things,

889
00:46:19,888 --> 00:46:21,789
like say something's happening.

890
00:46:22,149 --> 00:46:24,210
She's not sure how she feels about that.

891
00:46:25,051 --> 00:46:28,132
And then starts getting sort of irritated by it.

892
00:46:28,833 --> 00:46:30,373
So these are all sorts of things

893
00:46:30,433 --> 00:46:32,194
which were being generated live.

894
00:46:32,274 --> 00:46:34,055
Now we can kind of overlay everything.

895
00:46:34,596 --> 00:46:35,736
Hello.

896
00:46:35,816 --> 00:46:36,537
So she might not be...

897
00:46:36,697 --> 00:46:38,258
How can I help you?

898
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,358
In all these different sorts of states.

899
00:46:39,378 --> 00:46:40,559
Thank you.

900
00:46:41,966 --> 00:46:45,047
And because we're in San Francisco at the Game Developers Conference, we've got some

901
00:46:45,107 --> 00:46:47,528
cool glasses for her so she looks like a game developer.

902
00:46:47,968 --> 00:46:49,349
So there she is.

903
00:46:49,889 --> 00:46:52,750
And so she can hear me and do various sorts of things.

904
00:46:52,830 --> 00:46:56,971
So anyway, pretty much what I will...

905
00:47:00,388 --> 00:47:06,150
So basically that's the sort of system overview and it's thanks to a fantastic team that

906
00:47:06,170 --> 00:47:08,390
have got that we can put all these things together.

907
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:13,112
So we're working on lots of different technologies which are all going to start coming together

908
00:47:13,152 --> 00:47:17,633
this year, so we've got a lot of goodies to show probably in about a year.

909
00:47:17,953 --> 00:47:21,694
So some of this stuff is going to be out in the public in a few months.

910
00:47:22,174 --> 00:47:24,155
So yes, thanks very much.

911
00:47:37,952 --> 00:47:39,953
I think somehow we miraculously made it on time.

912
00:47:39,993 --> 00:47:42,655
I just went through all the hiccups.

913
00:47:42,675 --> 00:47:43,736
Sorry about the hiccups, guys.

914
00:47:43,776 --> 00:47:44,917
Thank you guys for coming.

915
00:47:45,977 --> 00:47:47,318
I guess we have like three minutes.

916
00:47:47,338 --> 00:47:49,040
You guys, anybody have any questions?

917
00:47:50,821 --> 00:47:51,001
No?

918
00:47:51,581 --> 00:47:52,042
Awesome.

919
00:47:52,702 --> 00:47:52,902
Thanks.
