1
00:00:21,632 --> 00:00:36,525
SORRY YOU HAD TO WATCH THIS

2
00:00:53,126 --> 00:01:04,981
**Philip sings the starry night away**

3
00:01:47,601 --> 00:01:48,581
Good afternoon, everyone.

4
00:01:48,601 --> 00:01:50,741
My name is Gary Scheinman.

5
00:01:51,649 --> 00:01:52,950
I scored Bioshock Infinite.

6
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:55,151
I actually scored all three of the Bioshock games.

7
00:01:55,391 --> 00:01:57,733
Bioshock Infinite, I guess, is Bioshock 3, in a way.

8
00:01:57,753 --> 00:01:59,594
I don't think they want to call it that.

9
00:02:02,095 --> 00:02:04,816
They've been fantastic games to work on.

10
00:02:05,357 --> 00:02:08,999
I'm very grateful to have been involved in these three really,

11
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,640
really beautifully made games.

12
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:14,642
And I've really just been honored that they chose me

13
00:02:14,662 --> 00:02:16,023
and that they appreciated my music.

14
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,707
got the gig because I did a game called Destroy All Humans.

15
00:02:22,867 --> 00:02:25,171
And the audio director, Emily Ridgway,

16
00:02:25,231 --> 00:02:26,794
went to work in Rational Games and said,

17
00:02:26,814 --> 00:02:27,996
you've got to hire Gary Scheinman.

18
00:02:28,677 --> 00:02:29,398
And so they did.

19
00:02:29,539 --> 00:02:31,502
And so it's been a very important.

20
00:02:33,107 --> 00:02:36,189
part of my career, these three really, really beautiful games.

21
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:40,373
But Infinite really was...

22
00:02:40,393 --> 00:02:44,436
Bioshock 1 had its own unique style,

23
00:02:44,777 --> 00:02:47,980
and Bioshock 2 also utilized the style of Bioshock 1.

24
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:48,940
It was really, it was a true...

25
00:02:50,922 --> 00:02:54,543
It was set in Rapture, this city under the sea, in the same period.

26
00:02:55,043 --> 00:03:00,564
So it really made sense to use the score, or the style of the score, from the original

27
00:03:00,584 --> 00:03:01,064
Bioshock.

28
00:03:01,104 --> 00:03:08,086
But when we got to Bioshock Infinite, everyone, including myself, did not want to use the

29
00:03:08,126 --> 00:03:09,586
material from Bioshock 1 and 2.

30
00:03:09,646 --> 00:03:10,786
It just did not make sense.

31
00:03:10,846 --> 00:03:12,787
It was a completely unique game.

32
00:03:12,827 --> 00:03:13,627
There are parallels.

33
00:03:14,168 --> 00:03:15,429
And we'll talk a little bit about that

34
00:03:15,609 --> 00:03:16,869
during my presentation today.

35
00:03:17,109 --> 00:03:19,711
But really, we had a completely fresh game.

36
00:03:20,511 --> 00:03:21,992
It was set in a different period, 1912,

37
00:03:22,092 --> 00:03:26,494
in a city in the sky, almost sort of the polar opposite

38
00:03:26,534 --> 00:03:27,735
in a way, 180 degrees.

39
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:30,416
And the bright, everything in Rapture

40
00:03:30,456 --> 00:03:32,717
was dark and dingy and drippy and wet.

41
00:03:32,737 --> 00:03:34,378
And everything in Bioshock Infinite

42
00:03:34,438 --> 00:03:38,020
is bright and sunny and blazing light.

43
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,221
So it really was a different game.

44
00:03:41,182 --> 00:03:41,482
I had.

45
00:03:42,483 --> 00:03:46,066
I can't not mention the partners that I had in the game.

46
00:03:46,126 --> 00:03:48,728
First of all, the entire team at Irrational Games.

47
00:03:48,808 --> 00:03:50,470
Unfortunately, they did close their doors.

48
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,672
But it's a great development team.

49
00:03:53,512 --> 00:03:58,976
Ken Levine, the creative director, is, I call him the Steve Jobs of video games.

50
00:03:59,156 --> 00:04:03,319
He really is a creative genius and I love working with him.

51
00:04:03,799 --> 00:04:08,122
Jim Bonney was the music director and Patrick Bothrop was the audio director

52
00:04:08,222 --> 00:04:12,445
and all those guys really did amazing things to make this game,

53
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:14,046
this really, really wonderful game.

54
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:18,804
And I am a contracted composer, so they were in Boston,

55
00:04:18,864 --> 00:04:21,847
and I was in LA basically throwing stuff over the fence

56
00:04:21,907 --> 00:04:23,449
and saying, how's this?

57
00:04:24,750 --> 00:04:27,733
When we first started, originally, I mean,

58
00:04:28,334 --> 00:04:30,396
because Bioshock 1 and 2 had been successful,

59
00:04:30,416 --> 00:04:33,139
there was no problem getting a budget

60
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,621
for an orchestra, a large orchestra.

61
00:04:35,661 --> 00:04:39,824
But, and initially we thought, hey, this is going to be orchestral, you know.

62
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:40,564
What do you want?

63
00:04:40,604 --> 00:04:41,444
Want to go to London?

64
00:04:42,125 --> 00:04:42,725
Where should we go?

65
00:04:42,745 --> 00:04:46,787
And it was like, okay, well, that's all cool and great.

66
00:04:46,827 --> 00:04:48,668
But it didn't turn out that way.

67
00:04:49,268 --> 00:04:51,089
A lot of things didn't turn out that way.

68
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:55,120
And I think for good reason, and I'm grateful that they didn't.

69
00:04:56,081 --> 00:05:00,866
The first music, some of the first music I wrote for them was a...

70
00:05:01,487 --> 00:05:02,748
Well, I wrote a trailer.

71
00:05:03,409 --> 00:05:06,192
I wrote the score to a trailer, which was a big presentation trailer.

72
00:05:06,432 --> 00:05:07,373
And then they had like a...

73
00:05:10,433 --> 00:05:15,136
a press release conference, and it was a live, and they showed images from the game,

74
00:05:15,176 --> 00:05:19,238
and they wanted me to write some original music. So I'm going to play a little bit of that, just so that

75
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:23,761
this was my initial early concept of what the score might sound like.

76
00:06:19,635 --> 00:06:27,419
Find out more at open.gdn.com

77
00:06:56,926 --> 00:07:01,807
And I don't know if any of you noticed it, but at the end you hear Mike country tis of thee in minor.

78
00:07:02,827 --> 00:07:09,329
Which, because this is a dystopian world, and it's set in this city that's very American,

79
00:07:09,749 --> 00:07:16,571
and everything about it is patriotic, and yet what it is, it's a breakaway city,

80
00:07:16,631 --> 00:07:19,331
and it is really sort of a dystopian America.

81
00:07:19,451 --> 00:07:22,052
What would happen if everything went horribly wrong?

82
00:07:22,612 --> 00:07:24,233
So I thought that was appropriate.

83
00:07:25,831 --> 00:07:30,135
And then we, I messed around with a lot of different approaches.

84
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:36,382
And it really wasn't until E3, there was an E3 the year before it came out, and they made a presentation there.

85
00:07:36,743 --> 00:07:40,707
And they had this AI character called Elizabeth, artificial intelligence.

86
00:07:40,867 --> 00:07:42,689
And she wasn't, she was...

87
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,291
an important character, but not the central character.

88
00:07:46,651 --> 00:07:49,892
But the press, everything written about that E3

89
00:07:49,932 --> 00:07:52,132
presentation had Elizabeth, Elizabeth, Elizabeth.

90
00:07:52,192 --> 00:07:56,753
And it became really, really such an important part

91
00:07:56,793 --> 00:07:58,814
of what people were discussing on the game

92
00:07:58,854 --> 00:08:02,155
that it really had an influence on the whole creative team.

93
00:08:02,195 --> 00:08:05,115
And they decided to elevate her character to really

94
00:08:05,155 --> 00:08:06,235
your partner in the game.

95
00:08:06,275 --> 00:08:07,976
And so this artificial intelligence

96
00:08:08,316 --> 00:08:09,136
becomes your partner.

97
00:08:09,156 --> 00:08:11,237
And it was at that point that I realized

98
00:08:11,317 --> 00:08:13,737
that she was really important and that she

99
00:08:14,197 --> 00:08:16,018
I ought to write a theme for her.

100
00:08:16,498 --> 00:08:19,179
And so I wrote a theme, but I didn't want,

101
00:08:19,719 --> 00:08:22,080
knowing Ken Levine, Ken really responds

102
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:23,240
to live performances.

103
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:25,361
So I said to Jim, I said, you know,

104
00:08:25,381 --> 00:08:27,762
I don't really want to send this theme over to anyone.

105
00:08:27,862 --> 00:08:28,822
I want to record it live.

106
00:08:28,842 --> 00:08:30,022
And he goes, well, you know,

107
00:08:30,062 --> 00:08:31,363
we really don't have a budget for that,

108
00:08:31,423 --> 00:08:32,743
just to do mock-ups.

109
00:08:32,783 --> 00:08:34,644
And I go, well, I'm going to come out of pocket.

110
00:08:34,964 --> 00:08:36,064
I really want to record this.

111
00:08:36,344 --> 00:08:38,585
So I recorded it with one cello and one viola.

112
00:08:38,605 --> 00:08:39,485
We did some overdubs.

113
00:08:39,525 --> 00:08:39,745
And so.

114
00:08:40,566 --> 00:08:46,410
I did this really, really simple tonal triadic theme for her,

115
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:53,395
but it was an important point in the realization for the approach for the entire score.

116
00:09:09,644 --> 00:09:09,804
You

117
00:09:44,744 --> 00:09:45,245
Thank you for watching.

118
00:10:09,500 --> 00:10:09,600
Ready?

119
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:09,680
One.

120
00:10:09,700 --> 00:10:09,840
Get set.

121
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:09,900
Go!

122
00:11:12,603 --> 00:11:18,809
So that simple theme, I sent that to Ken and Ken loved, I mean really loved it.

123
00:11:19,149 --> 00:11:24,815
It really moved him and it became my realization that I had that okay,

124
00:11:24,915 --> 00:11:29,399
this is the direction for the score. It's not orchestral, this is a really simple

125
00:11:29,459 --> 00:11:33,063
score and this involves really, really

126
00:11:34,524 --> 00:11:37,606
beautifully played, expressive solo instruments,

127
00:11:38,207 --> 00:11:44,511
and it somehow expressed the sadness of this world

128
00:11:45,031 --> 00:11:49,594
and expressed its, I don't know,

129
00:11:50,575 --> 00:11:52,876
I didn't, this is the thing, all throughout the game,

130
00:11:52,896 --> 00:11:54,397
they never told me how the game ended.

131
00:11:56,115 --> 00:11:59,638
I was scoring the end of the game and didn't understand what it was exactly.

132
00:11:59,978 --> 00:12:01,339
Because they were so secretive.

133
00:12:01,640 --> 00:12:03,842
But I knew there was this deep mystery.

134
00:12:03,882 --> 00:12:08,666
And so this simple music really was an epiphany for me and an epiphany for everyone in the

135
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:08,906
game.

136
00:12:09,827 --> 00:12:11,428
So, the realization was...

137
00:12:12,828 --> 00:12:13,449
Keep it simple.

138
00:12:14,609 --> 00:12:16,629
Small string ensembles, not orchestral.

139
00:12:17,429 --> 00:12:20,710
And the positive response to live string players

140
00:12:21,010 --> 00:12:21,690
that Ken had.

141
00:12:22,411 --> 00:12:24,871
And then I did something that I've never done before.

142
00:12:25,031 --> 00:12:27,932
And it was really worked on this.

143
00:12:27,952 --> 00:12:29,832
I don't know if it would work for any other project.

144
00:12:30,032 --> 00:12:32,113
But what I did was I said to Jim, I said, look,

145
00:12:32,973 --> 00:12:33,753
we have all this money.

146
00:12:34,113 --> 00:12:34,893
We're not going to spend it.

147
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:41,497
I think I have a way that's going to really work for me and for Ken and for you.

148
00:12:41,797 --> 00:12:43,938
I want to record my demos with live players.

149
00:12:45,039 --> 00:12:47,940
And he said, well, let's try that. He was open to that.

150
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:52,263
So I did a couple of sessions with live players, and Ken was really digging the result.

151
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,804
When I'd mock things up, he wasn't digging it or understanding it.

152
00:12:55,905 --> 00:12:58,226
When he heard it with live players, it was like...

153
00:12:58,606 --> 00:12:59,466
Yes, that's it.

154
00:12:59,606 --> 00:13:00,227
That sounds great.

155
00:13:00,507 --> 00:13:01,687
And it was just a realization.

156
00:13:01,827 --> 00:13:05,389
And I've never had more fun than working in that manner.

157
00:13:05,749 --> 00:13:06,650
It was just fantastic.

158
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:07,450
I'd write the music.

159
00:13:08,070 --> 00:13:10,832
And then a week later, I'd bring a string quartet in,

160
00:13:11,132 --> 00:13:13,713
and we'd record for three hours.

161
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:15,914
And two weeks later, I'd have.

162
00:13:16,054 --> 00:13:19,616
And eventually, it led me to the ideal string section

163
00:13:19,676 --> 00:13:20,456
for the game, which was.

164
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:25,759
ten string players, three violins, three violas, three cellos, and one double bass.

165
00:13:25,839 --> 00:13:27,420
And that seemed to be sort of like ideal.

166
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:31,143
Before that, I had as few as three sessions with string quartets,

167
00:13:31,383 --> 00:13:36,026
string quartet and double bass, just all sorts of different ensembles,

168
00:13:36,286 --> 00:13:38,747
and all of them with really great players.

169
00:13:38,767 --> 00:13:40,688
It was done in L.A., it was done at AFM,

170
00:13:41,069 --> 00:13:44,091
because it was grandfathered in from the old Bauschok game.

171
00:13:45,051 --> 00:13:47,613
And it was just totally working for him.

172
00:13:48,013 --> 00:13:49,995
And it was a really interesting way

173
00:13:50,075 --> 00:13:52,997
to really generate really cool music.

174
00:13:53,077 --> 00:13:57,181
And really, by the time I was nearly finished scoring it,

175
00:13:57,281 --> 00:13:59,483
most of the score had been recorded and was done.

176
00:13:59,503 --> 00:14:00,824
There was just an extra session or two

177
00:14:00,864 --> 00:14:02,785
that had to be put together.

178
00:14:03,963 --> 00:14:07,225
So there were several categories of this game

179
00:14:08,025 --> 00:14:09,086
the music would fit into.

180
00:14:09,146 --> 00:14:11,947
Now, there's also all the source music.

181
00:14:12,087 --> 00:14:13,788
I did not write the source music.

182
00:14:14,268 --> 00:14:17,390
Jim Bonney hired a bunch of really talented people

183
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:20,592
to do this fantastic job on the source music,

184
00:14:20,732 --> 00:14:21,933
really, really brilliant stuff.

185
00:14:22,975 --> 00:14:25,016
a barbershop quartet singing Beach Boy songs.

186
00:14:25,036 --> 00:14:26,157
Just really cool stuff.

187
00:14:26,197 --> 00:14:28,258
And if you play the game and you understand

188
00:14:28,338 --> 00:14:31,339
how this game is sort of unstuck in time and anything

189
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:34,601
is possible because time interacts with it

190
00:14:34,902 --> 00:14:37,483
in bizarre and crazy ways, they understand

191
00:14:37,563 --> 00:14:40,245
how a Beach Boy song could appear in 1912 being

192
00:14:40,285 --> 00:14:41,745
sung by a barbershop quartet.

193
00:14:43,146 --> 00:14:44,807
But the scripted events, scripted events

194
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:48,509
are really essentially little vignettes,

195
00:14:48,549 --> 00:14:51,251
little movie vignettes that are locked to time.

196
00:14:51,291 --> 00:14:52,491
So you can score them like a picture.

197
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:57,352
And really, the player has free agency, could walk away from them.

198
00:14:57,372 --> 00:14:59,234
And in fact, if you're playing the game for the fourth time,

199
00:14:59,254 --> 00:15:01,575
you're probably going to walk away from all the scripted events.

200
00:15:01,636 --> 00:15:05,118
But first time, you're definitely going to watch the scripted events,

201
00:15:05,178 --> 00:15:06,980
because something important is happening.

202
00:15:07,020 --> 00:15:09,161
And so most of these needed to be scored.

203
00:15:09,622 --> 00:15:11,223
So I'm going to play.

204
00:15:12,233 --> 00:15:16,119
This was a really interesting experiment initially.

205
00:15:16,419 --> 00:15:18,923
And really, once you get up to Columbia,

206
00:15:18,943 --> 00:15:21,486
the city in the sky, you end up in this little grotto.

207
00:15:21,527 --> 00:15:24,391
And then you open the door, and there is Columbia.

208
00:15:24,471 --> 00:15:25,392
And it's beautiful.

209
00:15:25,532 --> 00:15:26,754
It's really beautiful.

210
00:15:26,854 --> 00:15:27,275
It's like.

211
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,739
It's not a dark place, at least at this point.

212
00:15:31,219 --> 00:15:35,744
I did not want the music to be scary at all.

213
00:15:35,944 --> 00:15:39,828
And yet, I didn't want the music just to be happy-go-lucky.

214
00:15:39,868 --> 00:15:41,670
So what I did was I combined...

215
00:15:42,130 --> 00:15:44,132
I listened to Stephen Foster songs.

216
00:15:44,733 --> 00:15:49,016
for a couple of days, Stephen Foster being the great American songwriter of the 19th century,

217
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:54,559
and maybe there's a little New World Symphony. And I wrote this really simple, pretty melody

218
00:15:54,639 --> 00:16:00,663
with some simple chord changes, but then underneath it I added a chromatic, sort of slithery

219
00:16:02,184 --> 00:16:10,169
second layer that I thought represented what potentially is going to come at you in the city.

220
00:16:15,620 --> 00:16:17,240
thanks for watching, leading to this final video!

221
00:17:44,229 --> 00:17:48,252
So, and I used the video you see here as what I composed to.

222
00:17:48,593 --> 00:17:51,815
I just took that video and I thought it appropriate to bring that video.

223
00:17:52,155 --> 00:17:53,917
So, I just thought I'd show you this.

224
00:17:54,477 --> 00:17:59,901
I decided because I only had 10 players and because I wasn't sure how this was going to

225
00:17:59,961 --> 00:18:05,125
work when I recorded it, I thought I need to separate the tonal part from the chromatic

226
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:05,386
part.

227
00:18:05,906 --> 00:18:06,086
So...

228
00:18:07,412 --> 00:18:09,793
Here just really is just a very simple,

229
00:18:09,853 --> 00:18:11,654
with just sustained chords.

230
00:18:12,394 --> 00:18:14,315
Alyssa Park was the first violinist

231
00:18:14,395 --> 00:18:16,675
and she's just playing this really beautifully

232
00:18:16,795 --> 00:18:19,076
sweet solo, poco vibrato.

233
00:18:20,937 --> 00:18:23,698
And I decided to do very little with the accompaniment

234
00:18:23,718 --> 00:18:25,638
with the tone part because I didn't think

235
00:18:25,699 --> 00:18:28,279
the accompaniment, I thought if I made it busy,

236
00:18:28,579 --> 00:18:30,620
it would be fighting the other chromatic part.

237
00:18:37,513 --> 00:18:39,454
All right, so that's that.

238
00:18:40,515 --> 00:18:42,537
And then here's a look at the chromatic parts.

239
00:18:42,637 --> 00:18:44,999
So this chromatic part is actually quite complex,

240
00:18:45,459 --> 00:18:48,942
but played pianissimo so that it didn't fight it.

241
00:18:49,222 --> 00:18:50,443
But basically it's all strings.

242
00:18:50,523 --> 00:18:52,244
I used a little celesta as well.

243
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,305
["Celesta"]

244
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:25,761
And I thought, as I was separating them, I thought maybe there's a spot, and one thing

245
00:19:25,801 --> 00:19:30,602
to realize as a composer for a video game is that you never, there's no music, well

246
00:19:30,662 --> 00:19:34,663
there's, not always, but a lot of music can get utilized in different spots.

247
00:19:34,683 --> 00:19:39,025
So I thought, okay, I can deliver both of these to Jim, and he can use this in some

248
00:19:39,065 --> 00:19:42,346
other spot in the game, and I think he did, I'm not absolutely certain of that.

249
00:19:42,968 --> 00:19:46,535
So that was that experiment, and it really worked quite nicely.

250
00:19:46,576 --> 00:19:51,185
That music won the Gang Award for instrumental music of the year last year.

251
00:19:51,205 --> 00:19:52,307
So that was all very cool.

252
00:19:54,538 --> 00:19:58,381
And then there was another interesting aspect to the score,

253
00:19:58,421 --> 00:20:01,663
and that was there's these characters called the Lutece twins,

254
00:20:01,743 --> 00:20:04,044
and they are sort of in on the joke.

255
00:20:04,144 --> 00:20:06,025
They really kind of know what's happening

256
00:20:06,125 --> 00:20:10,488
throughout all these different permutations of time and interactions.

257
00:20:10,808 --> 00:20:14,511
And so they're sort of talking in what appears to be nonsense all the time,

258
00:20:14,531 --> 00:20:16,412
which only makes sense when you get to the end of the game

259
00:20:16,432 --> 00:20:19,614
and you realize that they know what all the different possibilities,

260
00:20:19,634 --> 00:20:21,015
and that really in this...

261
00:20:21,895 --> 00:20:27,057
alternative world, there's like millions, or perhaps an infinite, that's the term, infinite,

262
00:20:27,317 --> 00:20:33,500
possibilities of how this, things can turn out. And in the end, it does, you know,

263
00:20:34,160 --> 00:20:40,602
Booker, the Booker character, which you play, the solution is that he has to die. And that can,

264
00:20:40,842 --> 00:20:46,905
that's the only way to end it from being a tragic story. But here's the test twins.

265
00:20:48,265 --> 00:20:49,646
They... well at least she...

266
00:20:49,666 --> 00:20:53,068
invented the technology that allows the city to flow.

267
00:20:53,448 --> 00:20:54,508
Giant balls?

268
00:20:54,769 --> 00:20:58,951
Quantum particles suspended in space-time at a fixed height.

269
00:20:58,971 --> 00:21:01,072
So, not giant balls?

270
00:21:01,312 --> 00:21:05,635
But the thing is, my book said they disappeared several years ago.

271
00:21:05,895 --> 00:21:06,476
I didn't.

272
00:21:06,616 --> 00:21:07,756
I didn't.

273
00:21:07,856 --> 00:21:08,397
I didn't.

274
00:21:08,557 --> 00:21:09,357
I didn't.

275
00:21:09,377 --> 00:21:09,858
I didn't.

276
00:21:09,938 --> 00:21:11,498
But I don't.

277
00:21:11,519 --> 00:21:12,659
You sure that's right?

278
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:14,560
Something tells me they're not exactly what they appear to be.

279
00:21:15,202 --> 00:21:17,202
I was going to have to go to court.

280
00:21:17,382 --> 00:21:17,562
No.

281
00:21:17,602 --> 00:21:18,503
That's injunctive.

282
00:21:18,543 --> 00:21:19,643
That's not injunctive.

283
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:21,684
I don't think the syntax is important.

284
00:21:21,724 --> 00:21:24,405
I'm not telling you what I'm trying to do.

285
00:21:24,465 --> 00:21:26,325
A little bit of importunity there.

286
00:21:26,405 --> 00:21:28,786
I'm just not allowed to go to court.

287
00:21:28,926 --> 00:21:30,367
I know the syntax.

288
00:21:30,387 --> 00:21:31,267
There she jumps in.

289
00:21:31,347 --> 00:21:33,148
And the other woman is like,

290
00:21:35,874 --> 00:21:40,277
You see, the Lichess twins are in all these different places that you cross, and you don't...

291
00:21:40,477 --> 00:21:46,402
It doesn't make any sense until you understand that they're just completely unstuck in time and can do whatever the hell they want.

292
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,783
And then finally, I thought it was interesting.

293
00:21:51,823 --> 00:21:55,824
This is the one spot in the game where the music in Bioshock Infinite

294
00:21:56,164 --> 00:21:58,385
actually was similar to the original score,

295
00:21:59,305 --> 00:22:01,006
because you end up in Rapture.

296
00:22:01,686 --> 00:22:06,187
If you've played the game, you know you end up briefly in the city of Rapture

297
00:22:06,227 --> 00:22:10,049
because Elizabeth has this power to open tears, literally tears.

298
00:22:10,069 --> 00:22:11,669
She can open a tear in time.

299
00:22:11,689 --> 00:22:14,510
And when in danger, you can kind of dive through it.

300
00:22:14,550 --> 00:22:15,030
And they end up...

301
00:22:15,471 --> 00:22:18,116
actually in Rapture and they take a ride in a bathysphere,

302
00:22:18,156 --> 00:22:19,419
which is this submarine.

303
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:23,548
So I wrote a cue that kind of sounded like Rapture music,

304
00:22:23,568 --> 00:22:24,751
you know, from my original score.

305
00:22:39,222 --> 00:22:42,123
Thanks for watching !

306
00:23:02,361 --> 00:23:17,210
And you notice this open fifth sound, which is something that's used in the listening

307
00:23:17,230 --> 00:23:20,932
theme, became sort of a norm motif throughout the score.

308
00:23:21,212 --> 00:23:22,693
God, how beautiful.

309
00:23:22,873 --> 00:23:23,994
It's like the stars.

310
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:35,872
Are you going to open it?

311
00:23:35,952 --> 00:23:38,138
No, it's not worth it.

312
00:23:38,158 --> 00:23:38,519
Damn it.

313
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:41,387
I thought once we were here, I could fully control-

314
00:23:43,164 --> 00:23:45,926
So that oar motif gets used throughout the game,

315
00:23:45,966 --> 00:23:48,308
because to me it sort of represented the infinite.

316
00:23:48,368 --> 00:23:50,650
There's something magical about a fifth

317
00:23:50,670 --> 00:23:53,152
that's in relationship to the overtone series.

318
00:23:53,812 --> 00:23:58,055
So that ostinato figure literally appears

319
00:23:58,136 --> 00:23:59,737
in a lot of cues throughout the game

320
00:24:00,998 --> 00:24:03,620
and worked quite nicely as tying together.

321
00:24:03,640 --> 00:24:06,082
It's a simple, simple technique,

322
00:24:06,122 --> 00:24:07,763
but it just worked really beautifully.

323
00:24:10,306 --> 00:24:12,927
And then I wrote, they needed some mood music,

324
00:24:12,967 --> 00:24:14,187
they needed some ambient music,

325
00:24:14,227 --> 00:24:16,088
so I decided that I would write some,

326
00:24:16,668 --> 00:24:18,069
use some extended techniques

327
00:24:18,109 --> 00:24:20,210
and write some aleatory for this.

328
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:22,250
And I thought I'd show you just a few of the cues.

329
00:24:22,270 --> 00:24:25,352
And these I handed off to Jim and said,

330
00:24:25,392 --> 00:24:27,032
just use these wherever you need some mood,

331
00:24:27,192 --> 00:24:28,353
just, you know, whatever.

332
00:24:28,593 --> 00:24:30,574
And this is all done with small string ensembles.

333
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:35,878
If you think you need, and one lesson here is if you think you need a large string ensemble

334
00:24:36,178 --> 00:24:37,880
to do extended techniques, you really don't.

335
00:24:38,500 --> 00:24:40,302
A lot can be done with a string quartet.

336
00:25:07,384 --> 00:25:12,098
just simple chords using quarter tone detuning.

337
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:57,511
It's just creating some mood.

338
00:26:00,233 --> 00:26:01,794
I think up is the last one.

339
00:26:01,834 --> 00:26:12,042
And as this moves along, they get more and more out of tune, quarter tone-wise.

340
00:26:12,062 --> 00:26:16,885
The oscillation gets wider and wider.

341
00:26:26,811 --> 00:26:28,573
But it was very effective and very helpful.

342
00:26:34,881 --> 00:26:39,486
So combat music became a really interesting struggle.

343
00:26:40,030 --> 00:26:40,551
in this game.

344
00:26:40,971 --> 00:26:43,652
Because even though I'd found this idea

345
00:26:43,672 --> 00:26:45,632
and that everyone seemed really pleased with,

346
00:26:46,053 --> 00:26:48,013
which was to use these small string ensembles,

347
00:26:48,473 --> 00:26:50,894
there still was the feeling that combat music

348
00:26:50,974 --> 00:26:52,915
has to have large resources,

349
00:26:52,935 --> 00:26:55,656
that we had to have an orchestra to really play combat,

350
00:26:55,716 --> 00:26:56,896
to really make that work.

351
00:26:58,197 --> 00:27:00,858
And so I'm gonna play, I did a few combat cues,

352
00:27:00,898 --> 00:27:04,139
and it was really, the controversy was apparently raging

353
00:27:04,579 --> 00:27:07,620
in Boston, little known to the rest of the country,

354
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:12,181
about whether this combat music had to be orchestral or not

355
00:27:12,481 --> 00:27:15,242
and people were sort of like fighting Ken on it.

356
00:27:15,282 --> 00:27:17,022
Ken was feeling that the orchestral wasn't working.

357
00:27:17,042 --> 00:27:20,964
So I'm gonna play, here's a orchestral cue.

358
00:27:21,044 --> 00:27:23,204
I know the video's very fuzzy,

359
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,385
but this is what I was writing to.

360
00:27:32,730 --> 00:27:38,084
These are just samples because we didn't have to work with them.

361
00:27:38,104 --> 00:27:38,705
We didn't deploy the support.

362
00:27:38,745 --> 00:27:39,588
We didn't deploy the support.

363
00:28:04,598 --> 00:28:05,039
So hot.

364
00:28:22,819 --> 00:28:28,103
All right, so I think, I mean, there's nothing wrong with that piece of combat music for

365
00:28:28,123 --> 00:28:33,648
this chaotic combat sequences that were common in Bioshock, but Ken was feeling that it was

366
00:28:33,708 --> 00:28:34,589
not unique enough.

367
00:28:34,629 --> 00:28:38,613
And one of the, I remember from when I first started working on the original Bioshock,

368
00:28:39,013 --> 00:28:41,796
Emily called me and said, okay, she goes, here's the direction for the score.

369
00:28:42,176 --> 00:28:46,840
It can't sound like any other film, game, or TV score ever heard before.

370
00:28:49,638 --> 00:28:50,839
A little intimidating, okay?

371
00:28:51,179 --> 00:28:53,721
Well, sort of this is the same direction, okay?

372
00:28:53,821 --> 00:28:56,504
Can't sound like any film, TV, or game show before.

373
00:28:56,584 --> 00:29:01,708
So I started experimenting around with small ensembles.

374
00:29:01,828 --> 00:29:04,230
What can be done combat-wise with small ensembles?

375
00:29:04,290 --> 00:29:06,932
And I think it became actually a very interesting technique.

376
00:29:46,996 --> 00:29:51,726
I've to be very careful here because theЯЯЯЯЯЯЯяяяёаааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааЊааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааааа

377
00:30:35,602 --> 00:30:41,085
Alright, so, let's see what happens.

378
00:30:41,786 --> 00:30:54,393
I'm just going to stop the stream.

379
00:30:54,713 --> 00:30:56,454
Alright, now we get the idea.

380
00:30:57,459 --> 00:31:01,622
It's very annoying, but it really worked great in the game.

381
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:03,183
It really worked great.

382
00:31:03,243 --> 00:31:05,805
It really helped create this sense of things

383
00:31:05,945 --> 00:31:07,867
are completely out of control.

384
00:31:08,127 --> 00:31:11,370
This is really, it really facilitated

385
00:31:11,670 --> 00:31:14,172
what we wanted to accomplish in this game

386
00:31:14,212 --> 00:31:15,513
in terms of the combat music.

387
00:31:15,853 --> 00:31:17,855
And there's several different genres of this,

388
00:31:18,135 --> 00:31:20,917
but essentially what I did was I created

389
00:31:20,957 --> 00:31:22,779
this really repetitive.

390
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:28,541
percussion ostinato figures, and I just kept them going.

391
00:31:28,581 --> 00:31:30,822
I just, just relentless, they're just relentless.

392
00:31:30,842 --> 00:31:33,523
And then over that, added these figures,

393
00:31:33,583 --> 00:31:36,904
these aleatoric figures, sometimes rhythmic figures

394
00:31:37,024 --> 00:31:39,045
using the strings, and I'm gonna show you

395
00:31:39,205 --> 00:31:40,146
how I accomplished that.

396
00:31:40,506 --> 00:31:43,607
And I played most, we did bring in a percussionist one day,

397
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,128
but I played much of the percussion,

398
00:31:45,168 --> 00:31:46,588
and I didn't quantize it either.

399
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:50,230
I kept it very ragged, because my thinking on it was like,

400
00:31:51,670 --> 00:31:53,450
like a drum circle at Venice Beach.

401
00:31:53,490 --> 00:31:54,831
Any of you ever been to Venice Beach?

402
00:31:55,391 --> 00:31:59,912
It's like a bunch of guys smoking dope, playing drums, okay?

403
00:32:00,292 --> 00:32:02,892
And it's not necessarily quantized.

404
00:32:03,172 --> 00:32:04,073
And I thought that...

405
00:32:06,353 --> 00:32:08,914
I thought that that would be really effective here.

406
00:32:08,954 --> 00:32:11,714
That it's almost like just a bunch of guys getting their nerve up

407
00:32:11,734 --> 00:32:13,095
to go kill a bunch of other guys.

408
00:32:13,595 --> 00:32:15,715
And I thought that that kind of worked.

409
00:32:15,735 --> 00:32:18,356
So it was just me just playing this stuff in unquantized.

410
00:32:18,376 --> 00:32:19,756
And every now and then I'd be so out of breath.

411
00:32:20,162 --> 00:32:21,642
I'd nudge a note a little bit.

412
00:32:22,122 --> 00:32:25,623
So that was also part of the approach on it.

413
00:32:25,663 --> 00:32:31,305
So what I did was I wrote tons of little, short,

414
00:32:31,785 --> 00:32:34,466
aleatoric, intense moments.

415
00:32:34,686 --> 00:32:35,767
And I'm going to show you a few.

416
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:49,311
Just nails on chalkboard type of cues, you know.

417
00:33:04,007 --> 00:33:11,859
And then there's another example using basically just taking all these little bits of aleatory

418
00:33:12,019 --> 00:33:17,147
and sort of just massaging them together and making them work and overlapping them in any

419
00:33:17,187 --> 00:33:18,769
ways that felt creative to me.

420
00:33:29,536 --> 00:33:34,218
So it's really grating, but it really worked wonders in combat.

421
00:33:34,318 --> 00:33:38,619
It just created this sense of complete chaos, and it's frightening.

422
00:33:39,019 --> 00:33:41,140
And that was really what they wanted to achieve.

423
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:44,441
And it was all done, really, using these small string ensembles.

424
00:33:44,581 --> 00:33:45,061
It really...

425
00:33:47,061 --> 00:33:47,942
So I learned something.

426
00:33:48,523 --> 00:33:51,285
I was fighting for the orchestral combat music.

427
00:33:51,886 --> 00:33:54,829
Of course, I like to have an orchestra to record with too.

428
00:33:55,009 --> 00:33:56,730
So maybe there was a bit of selfishness there.

429
00:33:56,771 --> 00:34:00,934
But really, I really felt that you can't have combat

430
00:34:00,954 --> 00:34:03,917
without an orchestra in this context.

431
00:34:03,977 --> 00:34:04,878
But I was wrong.

432
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:06,319
And Ken was right.

433
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,783
And it is a lesson to be learned that very often,

434
00:34:10,123 --> 00:34:12,465
your creative partners, the people you're working with,

435
00:34:13,126 --> 00:34:17,287
They know their game better than you know their game.

436
00:34:17,467 --> 00:34:19,909
You are a partner, and sometimes you have some good ideas,

437
00:34:20,109 --> 00:34:22,770
and they'll totally recognize it when you come up with them.

438
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,771
But sometimes they know something.

439
00:34:24,831 --> 00:34:26,371
Well, they weren't telling me how the game ended, either.

440
00:34:26,832 --> 00:34:30,593
So, uh, but they knew something,

441
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:32,934
and Ken in particular is this just brilliant guy,

442
00:34:32,954 --> 00:34:34,655
and he just is very intuitive.

443
00:34:34,695 --> 00:34:37,336
He can't say, well, it needs to be aleatoric

444
00:34:37,356 --> 00:34:40,578
with small string ensembles and a ragged percussion track.

445
00:34:40,798 --> 00:34:41,498
He can't say that.

446
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,160
Because he doesn't have that musical knowledge.

447
00:34:44,420 --> 00:34:47,082
But he can, he'll tell you when he doesn't like something.

448
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:51,806
And so it really pushed me to create these sorts of.

449
00:34:51,926 --> 00:34:53,828
And here I am.

450
00:34:57,212 --> 00:34:59,034
And these are just, and the interesting thing,

451
00:34:59,315 --> 00:35:00,616
another thing that I learned was,

452
00:35:00,836 --> 00:35:02,178
you would think if you doubled it,

453
00:35:02,238 --> 00:35:03,379
it would make it more intense.

454
00:35:03,419 --> 00:35:05,681
How many thinks it gets more intense when you double it?

455
00:35:06,642 --> 00:35:08,424
Well, it doesn't, it gets less intense

456
00:35:08,524 --> 00:35:11,688
because it takes all the jagged edges off

457
00:35:11,748 --> 00:35:13,290
and it, because they're all gonna be,

458
00:35:13,350 --> 00:35:14,831
you know, flamming with one another.

459
00:35:15,352 --> 00:35:15,652
And, uh.

460
00:35:17,042 --> 00:35:20,607
And so really it was a single pass that was the most effective.

461
00:35:20,627 --> 00:35:23,951
And I would double these, and we'd listen back and go,

462
00:35:24,151 --> 00:35:26,394
whoa, it doesn't sound as intense.

463
00:35:26,574 --> 00:35:28,877
It's like really not driving anymore.

464
00:35:28,957 --> 00:35:31,620
So it became clear that

465
00:35:35,896 --> 00:35:40,019
these instruments play with this sort of dry intensity

466
00:35:40,319 --> 00:35:41,981
like, I'm in this space,

467
00:35:42,401 --> 00:35:45,043
and a single pass was much more effective

468
00:35:45,103 --> 00:35:46,564
than just doubling and tripling.

469
00:35:46,664 --> 00:35:49,607
I mean, I could have taken out 10 strings and made it 30,

470
00:35:49,947 --> 00:35:51,228
but it wasn't effective.

471
00:36:03,955 --> 00:36:07,018
Just write words like scream on top of the track.

472
00:36:08,039 --> 00:36:10,862
And then let them tell, you know, scream.

473
00:36:12,844 --> 00:36:13,024
So...

474
00:36:15,667 --> 00:36:17,189
A couple more. Violent, intense.

475
00:36:29,677 --> 00:36:32,679
So just really annoying stuff, OK?

476
00:36:33,120 --> 00:36:34,220
The more annoying, the better.

477
00:36:35,421 --> 00:36:38,103
And the players were a little annoyed by it, too, at times.

478
00:36:38,523 --> 00:36:40,524
But it really just worked so well.

479
00:36:40,645 --> 00:36:43,406
I think, um, so here's another.

480
00:36:43,747 --> 00:36:45,688
Then there was another, uh, well, let me see.

481
00:36:45,728 --> 00:36:49,190
This is a little bit, just a little bit

482
00:36:49,210 --> 00:36:50,611
of some of those techniques.

483
00:36:51,452 --> 00:36:53,173
You can hear some of the stuff you just heard.

484
00:36:53,253 --> 00:36:56,495
And me just sort of creating a montage out of it.

485
00:36:56,555 --> 00:36:58,496
And using them and doubling them.

486
00:36:59,674 --> 00:37:02,735
And literally taking the audio, putting it into my DAW,

487
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:06,756
and just moving it around until it made sense to me.

488
00:37:06,856 --> 00:37:10,077
All right.

489
00:37:10,837 --> 00:37:12,638
And then there was another type of combat cue,

490
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:16,779
which was really sort of written out, sort of through composed.

491
00:37:17,159 --> 00:37:24,742
And really, it involved using sort of like violent string

492
00:37:24,842 --> 00:37:25,362
ostinatos.

493
00:37:25,422 --> 00:37:26,162
So here's.

494
00:37:35,361 --> 00:37:40,725
Again, though, with these repetitive drama Venice beach stunts.

495
00:37:40,765 --> 00:37:45,748
I actually thought of going to Venice beach to see if I could get there.

496
00:37:45,768 --> 00:37:49,471
But then I thought, it won't match temples.

497
00:37:49,511 --> 00:37:53,934
The better of that I didn't.

498
00:37:54,315 --> 00:37:55,876
I forgot my ask.

499
00:38:05,255 --> 00:38:11,756
And Ken also said something, because I mean, the composer in me wants these types of cues

500
00:38:11,856 --> 00:38:18,698
to be, to change and to do, to, you know, Jerry Goldsmith was one of my great teachers.

501
00:38:18,738 --> 00:38:21,999
I mean, I didn't, he didn't study with them privately or anything, but just listening

502
00:38:22,019 --> 00:38:25,839
to his music, and when he did comedy, he would just like all of a sudden go to something

503
00:38:25,879 --> 00:38:27,440
quite different and do something else.

504
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,820
But Ken said, Ken didn't want that.

505
00:38:29,880 --> 00:38:32,641
He really wanted what I'd call like musical meatloaf.

506
00:38:32,981 --> 00:38:35,443
Like wherever you cut it, it's kind of the same.

507
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:37,244
Here, or there's sort of, you know.

508
00:38:38,686 --> 00:38:43,009
So, and he was right, because he really felt like

509
00:38:43,569 --> 00:38:47,072
if this music is changing too much,

510
00:38:47,152 --> 00:38:49,014
it's gonna sound like you're catching things,

511
00:38:49,074 --> 00:38:50,134
and he didn't want that.

512
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:52,616
Again, he knew his game, and he pushed me

513
00:38:52,656 --> 00:38:54,278
to do some really brilliant things, I think.

514
00:38:55,892 --> 00:38:58,453
And then there was just, the final is just layered combat,

515
00:38:58,473 --> 00:39:00,454
because there's times, there were times in the game

516
00:39:00,774 --> 00:39:03,595
when the character would be fighting these, you know,

517
00:39:04,515 --> 00:39:08,716
game characters and he would, Booker would duck away,

518
00:39:08,736 --> 00:39:09,876
you know, kind of get away from it.

519
00:39:09,916 --> 00:39:13,197
So basically, just crossfade to a less intense version

520
00:39:13,358 --> 00:39:14,118
of the same track.

521
00:39:14,178 --> 00:39:15,338
And there are three layers.

522
00:39:15,358 --> 00:39:19,739
There's active, passive, and then what Jim called turtling,

523
00:39:19,799 --> 00:39:21,360
like a little turtle getting in a shell.

524
00:39:21,740 --> 00:39:23,201
So here's just some example.

525
00:39:23,301 --> 00:39:24,301
Here would be the active.

526
00:39:27,587 --> 00:39:34,329
There was a lot of combat in this game.

527
00:39:35,870 --> 00:39:39,491
And so then here would be the passive version.

528
00:39:54,742 --> 00:39:55,642
much less intense.

529
00:39:56,223 --> 00:39:59,205
It's completely in sync, tempo-wise,

530
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:01,887
but basically, so you can easily crossfade

531
00:40:01,947 --> 00:40:03,569
back and forth between that track

532
00:40:04,069 --> 00:40:07,352
and the other combat, the full active version.

533
00:40:08,453 --> 00:40:11,395
A simple technique, but it worked well here.

534
00:40:13,196 --> 00:40:15,138
And then turtling, in the turtling,

535
00:40:15,258 --> 00:40:18,140
I added some tension strings.

536
00:40:19,693 --> 00:40:22,975
because the percussion is almost gone, everything is almost gone.

537
00:40:23,015 --> 00:40:25,737
So I just felt it needed some kind of tension.

538
00:40:26,137 --> 00:40:31,200
So I actually added this extra layer of tension strings.

539
00:40:34,862 --> 00:40:38,444
But again, totally in sync with the other two cues.

540
00:40:38,484 --> 00:40:42,806
So you could easily ramp it up to the full active within a bar

541
00:40:42,866 --> 00:40:44,227
and you're there.

542
00:40:44,667 --> 00:40:44,787
So.

543
00:40:48,525 --> 00:40:55,016
A couple of things that I would recommend in sort of like closing here and before I

544
00:40:55,036 --> 00:40:56,299
take some questions from you guys.

545
00:40:57,933 --> 00:41:08,580
I've always tried, when possible, to suggest music that I just somehow intuitively feel would be useful for the game.

546
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:16,766
I just have some sense that, hey, this cue, and thus the Elizabeth cue, which was sort of a realization that,

547
00:41:17,006 --> 00:41:22,669
hey, this team has found the center of this game now, the Elizabeth character, now I have to write some music for it.

548
00:41:23,170 --> 00:41:25,170
And that was an epiphany for myself,

549
00:41:25,350 --> 00:41:27,171
in terms of finding the style for the game,

550
00:41:27,211 --> 00:41:30,631
and also in terms of Ken really going, yes, yes, this is it.

551
00:41:30,711 --> 00:41:32,412
This is the style for this.

552
00:41:32,872 --> 00:41:36,913
And there was another cue I did that was called AD, which

553
00:41:36,973 --> 00:41:39,213
is literally, originally, I was thinking, well,

554
00:41:39,253 --> 00:41:41,314
maybe I need to write a Booker theme.

555
00:41:41,374 --> 00:41:42,094
So I wrote this.

556
00:41:42,274 --> 00:41:45,175
And they liked this music a lot, but at first,

557
00:41:45,215 --> 00:41:46,095
they had nowhere to put it.

558
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:48,375
And then Jim says, I found a spot for it.

559
00:41:48,435 --> 00:41:50,796
So he ended up using it in this moment.

560
00:41:51,196 --> 00:41:57,320
where you find out really how Elizabeth gets unstuck in time

561
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,421
because she's going.

562
00:41:59,522 --> 00:42:00,423
It's complex.

563
00:42:00,443 --> 00:42:04,886
It's not worth going to, but if you played the game,

564
00:42:04,906 --> 00:42:08,468
you know it's this really complex set of circumstances

565
00:42:08,528 --> 00:42:12,791
where it only makes sense, actually,

566
00:42:12,811 --> 00:42:17,195
when you go to Wikipedia and read.

567
00:42:18,942 --> 00:42:20,522
No, I'm kidding.

568
00:42:20,822 --> 00:42:23,423
It does make sense, but it is complex.

569
00:42:23,463 --> 00:42:24,263
It's really complex.

570
00:42:24,303 --> 00:42:26,984
And really, I had to read online like, oh, OK.

571
00:42:27,925 --> 00:42:28,665
I see now.

572
00:42:28,925 --> 00:42:31,506
It all totally makes sense.

573
00:42:31,526 --> 00:42:34,066
Because it's a really, I mean, one of the things

574
00:42:34,307 --> 00:42:37,568
that Irrational is and has been really good at

575
00:42:37,628 --> 00:42:39,188
is this story, you know?

576
00:42:39,268 --> 00:42:41,189
And so they created a very complex story.

577
00:42:41,209 --> 00:42:44,630
But I just thought I'd sort of play the AD theme, which

578
00:42:44,710 --> 00:42:45,850
is originally the Booker theme.

579
00:42:51,703 --> 00:42:51,924
and

580
00:42:52,004 --> 00:42:52,224
and

581
00:42:52,304 --> 00:42:52,384
and

582
00:42:52,604 --> 00:42:52,684
and

583
00:42:52,764 --> 00:42:52,824
and

584
00:42:52,904 --> 00:42:52,984
and

585
00:42:53,064 --> 00:42:53,144
and

586
00:43:27,688 --> 00:43:31,431
Okay, and I'll talk to you soon.

587
00:43:31,471 --> 00:43:31,531
Bye!

588
00:44:04,935 --> 00:44:12,418
This morning I told a story of something I read years ago that's always stuck with me

589
00:44:12,478 --> 00:44:13,758
and it's always helped me.

590
00:44:14,218 --> 00:44:16,939
And it was something that Stravinsky, Igor Stravinsky said.

591
00:44:17,440 --> 00:44:21,841
And he said that, and he wrote at the piano.

592
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:25,122
That's where he didn't have any samples.

593
00:44:25,662 --> 00:44:26,643
So he wrote at the piano.

594
00:44:27,143 --> 00:44:28,403
And he said, if you...

595
00:44:30,311 --> 00:44:31,892
to the piano and say, start writing,

596
00:44:32,352 --> 00:44:33,892
is I don't know where to start.

597
00:44:34,292 --> 00:44:36,573
I just, I have no idea. It's infinite.

598
00:44:37,514 --> 00:44:38,234
No pun intended.

599
00:44:39,394 --> 00:44:40,755
But if you play two notes,

600
00:44:40,995 --> 00:44:43,135
I can start composing immediately.

601
00:44:43,796 --> 00:44:46,337
And so, and that always struck me

602
00:44:46,397 --> 00:44:47,297
as really critical,

603
00:44:47,477 --> 00:44:48,737
and something that we need to think about

604
00:44:48,797 --> 00:44:51,458
is whether any kind of creative aspect

605
00:44:51,658 --> 00:44:54,860
of games or anything, really,

606
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:55,920
it's like, get started.

607
00:44:56,140 --> 00:44:57,881
Find your two notes. Find something.

608
00:44:57,921 --> 00:44:58,761
And then take that.

609
00:44:59,274 --> 00:45:01,635
and then see where that leads you.

610
00:45:01,836 --> 00:45:06,078
And so this is really how I found my two notes in this game.

611
00:45:06,218 --> 00:45:09,160
And it was a fantastic experience.

612
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:12,302
I received the BAFTA for this score, which was incredible.

613
00:45:12,322 --> 00:45:13,482
I wish I'd gone to London.

614
00:45:13,522 --> 00:45:14,823
I didn't, unfortunately.

615
00:45:14,843 --> 00:45:19,085
Because I didn't know if I'd win or not.

616
00:45:19,546 --> 00:45:22,247
Actually, the end of that week, I was heading up to Seattle

617
00:45:22,267 --> 00:45:27,890
to record a Shadow of the Mordor game.

618
00:45:27,910 --> 00:45:28,030
So.

619
00:45:29,822 --> 00:45:32,364
In any event, it's been all three of the games.

620
00:45:32,604 --> 00:45:34,165
I don't know if they'll make another Bioshock.

621
00:45:34,305 --> 00:45:36,566
I hope they do, but I'm not...

622
00:45:37,147 --> 00:45:41,710
I kind of think Ken has gone on to different stories to tell.

623
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:43,371
So in any event, if you have questions,

624
00:45:43,431 --> 00:45:46,333
I'm happy to take some questions from you guys.

625
00:45:47,554 --> 00:45:47,694
And...

626
00:46:00,228 --> 00:46:00,995
Great presentation.

627
00:46:01,036 --> 00:46:01,318
Thank you.

628
00:46:03,611 --> 00:46:13,277
With the smaller ensemble, you mentioned earlier that it can be, not intimidating, but it can be preferable to use a large orchestra for combat music.

629
00:46:13,798 --> 00:46:14,758
I thought so, I thought.

630
00:46:15,099 --> 00:46:28,608
Right. Was part of that transition in the way of thinking influenced by, in the games like Bioshock where you have so many different sound effects considerations with the vigors or plasmids, all the different weapon sounds.

631
00:46:29,588 --> 00:46:32,710
I found that when I was playing Infinite, I thought that.

632
00:46:33,070 --> 00:46:39,153
the music really cut through a tremendous amount because of the less that was going on

633
00:46:39,613 --> 00:46:43,875
in terms of not as many timbres getting buried by a gunshot, etc.

634
00:46:43,915 --> 00:46:45,075
Do you think that that...

635
00:46:46,156 --> 00:46:47,156
I do think that that worked.

636
00:46:47,256 --> 00:46:51,298
I certainly... I wasn't conscious of that because I was sending music to Jim

637
00:46:51,338 --> 00:46:52,638
and Jim was implementing it and going,

638
00:46:52,658 --> 00:46:54,739
yeah, this is working, or if there was a problem with it,

639
00:46:54,759 --> 00:46:58,180
okay, it's working up to here, you need to fix it, and he'd tell me why.

640
00:46:58,801 --> 00:47:00,962
And it is sort of like the contractor's dilemma.

641
00:47:00,982 --> 00:47:02,522
I mean, you aren't in-house.

642
00:47:03,243 --> 00:47:09,252
You're sort of doing the best you can from afar, but there is an advantage to being in-house.

643
00:47:10,232 --> 00:47:15,875
as well. But yeah, I do think that that definitely was very effective in helping that. But again,

644
00:47:15,915 --> 00:47:20,837
I mean, it's just always be open to a paradigm shift. That's another thing that I just keep

645
00:47:20,917 --> 00:47:26,680
telling myself, because no matter how certain you are of this is the way something ought

646
00:47:26,720 --> 00:47:32,243
to be done, you need to be open to the possibility that something that you completely different.

647
00:47:32,263 --> 00:47:38,247
I mean, Mahler said, Gustav Mahler said, in his late 50s, is, I am always the student.

648
00:47:38,627 --> 00:47:39,948
he's always learning something new.

649
00:47:39,968 --> 00:47:41,269
So I learned something new in this,

650
00:47:41,329 --> 00:47:43,250
and I learned it from the development team,

651
00:47:43,330 --> 00:47:45,552
who, especially Ken, who just kept pushing

652
00:47:45,592 --> 00:47:47,033
until he got what he wanted.

653
00:47:47,093 --> 00:47:49,976
And then I'm like, yes, this is frickin' awesome.

654
00:47:50,016 --> 00:47:50,636
This is great.

655
00:47:51,237 --> 00:47:51,437
So.

656
00:47:51,677 --> 00:47:52,277
Great, thank you.

657
00:47:52,518 --> 00:47:52,658
Sure.

658
00:47:54,272 --> 00:47:56,475
That was a great presentation. Thanks for sharing with us.

659
00:47:56,936 --> 00:48:06,649
My question is, when you're writing this aleatory music that is so intensely emotional and dependent

660
00:48:06,669 --> 00:48:11,195
on the performance, how do you cope with not knowing exactly how it's going to sound until

661
00:48:11,215 --> 00:48:11,956
you get to the studio?

662
00:48:13,209 --> 00:48:18,853
Well, I mean, you have to do a study of aleatoric music.

663
00:48:18,873 --> 00:48:21,695
You have to have some sense of how it's going to sound.

664
00:48:21,876 --> 00:48:24,738
If you've never written anything aleatoric,

665
00:48:24,798 --> 00:48:26,199
or you haven't studied the scores

666
00:48:26,239 --> 00:48:27,780
of the great aleatoric composers,

667
00:48:28,160 --> 00:48:31,783
then you may, in fact, kind of make some mistakes

668
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,044
and find yourself.

669
00:48:34,008 --> 00:48:36,189
with unsatisfactory results.

670
00:48:36,489 --> 00:48:39,370
So I felt fairly confident that what I'd written

671
00:48:39,450 --> 00:48:40,670
was going to be effective.

672
00:48:40,930 --> 00:48:42,171
And then you're there.

673
00:48:42,271 --> 00:48:43,891
You talk to the players, and you adjust.

674
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:46,952
If something's not working, you just go, OK,

675
00:48:47,172 --> 00:48:49,653
let's try that down a fifth, because it's just not

676
00:48:49,693 --> 00:48:50,773
quite working in that register.

677
00:48:51,253 --> 00:48:53,494
Or can you give that any more?

678
00:48:54,134 --> 00:49:01,118
At one point I asked that and then one of the bass players broke his bow and he just left.

679
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:08,602
He was so pissed. You know, he was doing Colenio and I'm just thinking, you know,

680
00:49:08,622 --> 00:49:11,703
I mean, you should use a pencil for that or a piece of wood, but in any event.

681
00:49:12,304 --> 00:49:15,305
So yeah, you adjust on the scene.

682
00:49:16,545 --> 00:49:18,846
But I think you need to do some study of it

683
00:49:18,886 --> 00:49:21,167
so that you are confident that you're not wasting your time.

684
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:23,988
But in this context, we had the money,

685
00:49:24,028 --> 00:49:25,648
so if anything really didn't work,

686
00:49:25,688 --> 00:49:28,449
there was lots of stuff that ended up on the cutting room floor

687
00:49:28,469 --> 00:49:29,990
that just didn't quite work.

688
00:49:30,050 --> 00:49:33,211
But we had the, you know...

689
00:49:34,193 --> 00:49:35,573
We knew we were on the right direction.

690
00:49:35,613 --> 00:49:40,014
So if every single aleatoric little vignette was not useful,

691
00:49:40,054 --> 00:49:41,775
then so be it.

692
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:42,635
That's OK, too.

693
00:49:46,075 --> 00:49:46,476
Hi, Gary.

694
00:49:46,776 --> 00:49:48,856
Congratulations on a great achievement.

695
00:49:49,196 --> 00:49:49,936
Thank you.

696
00:49:50,596 --> 00:49:55,237
Actually, following up on the aleatoric element, a lot of us

697
00:49:55,318 --> 00:49:59,518
would face the actual predicament

698
00:49:59,618 --> 00:50:02,099
of having to have the music reviewed.

699
00:50:02,719 --> 00:50:04,800
before going to the studio to record it.

700
00:50:05,561 --> 00:50:09,843
So we would face the issue of having to try and mock up these...

701
00:50:10,023 --> 00:50:13,044
This is the fix. Hire small string ensembles.

702
00:50:13,244 --> 00:50:17,766
Yeah, but obviously, but, like, to have, even before you go to the studio,

703
00:50:17,806 --> 00:50:20,848
to have the game director hear your music...

704
00:50:21,547 --> 00:50:22,887
beforehand. How do you?

705
00:50:23,327 --> 00:50:26,609
Oh, well, yes, that that is a challenge. If you haven't, I

706
00:50:26,649 --> 00:50:30,151
mean, I now have a whole library of stuff that I can sort of

707
00:50:30,171 --> 00:50:34,553
drawn to use as placeholders until it gets replaced. But you

708
00:50:34,593 --> 00:50:38,175
know, you can you literally could go anywhere in the

709
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:44,240
literature and take snippets of music and use it as placeholder say it's this

710
00:50:44,260 --> 00:50:48,363
is kind of what I want to achieve so I would say as long as it doesn't end up

711
00:50:48,403 --> 00:50:51,987
in the game I think that's a perfectly cool thing to do as or or and they're

712
00:50:52,067 --> 00:50:55,189
also like symphobia and other libraries do have

713
00:50:56,491 --> 00:50:58,874
you know, pre-rendered, uh, aleatoric tracks.

714
00:50:58,914 --> 00:51:02,619
Problem with those is that so many of them have been heard a lot on television

715
00:51:02,659 --> 00:51:04,181
and used incessantly.

716
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:07,686
So I try not to use them, uh, even though some of them are quite good

717
00:51:07,786 --> 00:51:09,048
because it just, they just feel.

718
00:51:10,087 --> 00:51:10,587
worn out.

719
00:51:11,087 --> 00:51:16,091
So, you know, and by the way, you can take traditional samples and you can do things

720
00:51:16,151 --> 00:51:20,174
with them, detune them, and do some really creative things with them.

721
00:51:20,534 --> 00:51:26,518
So, and if you just can bring in one player, bring in one player, bring in a violinist

722
00:51:26,818 --> 00:51:29,280
and then overdub and create some effects, you know?

723
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:33,183
Yeah, it wouldn't sound even close to how effective that is when you actually have those

724
00:51:33,223 --> 00:51:34,624
musicians together and they're like...

725
00:51:35,520 --> 00:51:36,641
they're playing their instrument that way.

726
00:51:37,002 --> 00:51:41,986
Right, but look, you have to wing it to some extent.

727
00:51:42,406 --> 00:51:47,810
So you have to experiment and you have to really try to find

728
00:51:47,991 --> 00:51:50,352
and maybe the answer is to find some things

729
00:51:50,413 --> 00:51:53,295
from the pre-existing tracks and say,

730
00:51:53,335 --> 00:51:55,537
this is gonna get replaced by something similar.

731
00:51:55,557 --> 00:51:57,098
Okay, thank you.

732
00:51:57,518 --> 00:51:57,658
Sure.

733
00:52:00,422 --> 00:52:10,006
So one of the most effective elements of Bioshock Infinite's music for me was that the ending flourish when combat is over and all the enemies have been defeated.

734
00:52:10,066 --> 00:52:17,289
And I thought you might get into this, but you actually didn't. So I was just curious, was that your idea? Was that something you talked with Ken and Jim about?

735
00:52:17,369 --> 00:52:18,569
Like, how did that particular...

736
00:52:19,450 --> 00:52:21,371
uh, flourish at the end of combat come about.

737
00:52:21,551 --> 00:52:23,272
Wait, say, wait, wait, what, in which queue?

738
00:52:23,732 --> 00:52:26,194
The, the ending, you know, when you, all the enemies are defeated

739
00:52:26,334 --> 00:52:31,297
and there's sort of that dissonant, like, uh, I'm not, I'm not even sure.

740
00:52:31,317 --> 00:52:32,238
Right, right, this, this gap.

741
00:52:32,258 --> 00:52:36,280
Yeah, yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's this very effective, just, I'm not a musician,

742
00:52:36,300 --> 00:52:40,763
so I just, like, hear it, just, for me, it was an incredibly effective notion that,

743
00:52:40,883 --> 00:52:42,304
okay, combat is ended, this.

744
00:52:43,169 --> 00:52:46,233
like period of intensity has ended and now you're safe.

745
00:52:47,114 --> 00:52:52,201
Um, uh, so, I mean, do, uh, do you recall what, uh, at that point in the game or in

746
00:52:52,301 --> 00:52:53,022
that point in combat?

747
00:52:54,029 --> 00:52:59,811
You'd have to play that for me so that I recall exactly what they requested there.

748
00:53:00,031 --> 00:53:00,731
Yeah.

749
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:04,132
In that case, wouldn't that have been something that they requested then?

750
00:53:04,272 --> 00:53:05,633
Yes, they would have requested that.

751
00:53:05,713 --> 00:53:10,794
And Jim asked, sometimes he asked for stingers that he ended up using in different spots

752
00:53:11,014 --> 00:53:12,455
that I wasn't even aware of.

753
00:53:12,615 --> 00:53:17,036
So I created, I had literally probably spent an hour just doing stingers.

754
00:53:17,616 --> 00:53:19,577
And I wrote tons and tons and tons of them.

755
00:53:20,337 --> 00:53:24,103
you know, we recorded them and then just here, use them any way you want.

756
00:53:24,344 --> 00:53:25,946
Okay. Well, it was very effective nonetheless.

757
00:53:26,067 --> 00:53:26,688
Thanks. Thank you.

758
00:53:29,212 --> 00:53:29,272
Hi.

759
00:53:30,598 --> 00:53:36,159
During the combat music, I found a lot of it when I was personally playing that a lot of the percussive elements

760
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:37,699
and even

761
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:40,820
the strings in the way that they would interact with each other

762
00:53:41,560 --> 00:53:46,881
Sounded quite a bit like alarms was that a conscious decision or was that just sort of a happy accident that you know?

763
00:53:46,981 --> 00:53:51,722
It sort of sounded like an old firebell from that era or like the the old crank

764
00:53:51,782 --> 00:53:55,503
Sirens that were on on fire trucks at that point that just it

765
00:53:55,703 --> 00:53:58,604
the the choices made felt

766
00:53:59,824 --> 00:54:03,646
Like they were conscious as opposed to just like oh great that worked

767
00:54:04,267 --> 00:54:10,530
Well, I don't I wasn't thinking about that and I didn't actually use any old alarms. I certainly had some metal

768
00:54:10,890 --> 00:54:13,292
percussion instruments that possibly

769
00:54:14,332 --> 00:54:18,915
You know were what you were thinking of when you heard those and I would you know have them banging away

770
00:54:19,835 --> 00:54:20,797
probably just me playing.

771
00:54:20,817 --> 00:54:22,839
Although one day I did bring in a percussionist

772
00:54:22,859 --> 00:54:24,161
and had him play all day.

773
00:54:24,181 --> 00:54:25,503
And that was a great experience.

774
00:54:26,043 --> 00:54:29,648
But it just turned out that I have a lot of percussion.

775
00:54:29,728 --> 00:54:31,030
And the percussion was working.

776
00:54:31,070 --> 00:54:33,533
And by the way, we really were fighting against not

777
00:54:35,936 --> 00:54:38,637
wanting to have the big Hans Zimmerisch drums.

778
00:54:38,717 --> 00:54:41,518
We wanted small drums and smaller instruments,

779
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,919
just like that some human being might actually

780
00:54:43,979 --> 00:54:45,600
be playing in the real world.

781
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:48,541
Again, back to my Venice Beach sort of analogy.

782
00:54:48,581 --> 00:54:51,863
But we wanted, like, they didn't need to be these giant.

783
00:54:52,403 --> 00:54:55,204
As a matter of fact, those were too cinematic and too,

784
00:54:55,605 --> 00:54:56,605
and, and, uh,

785
00:54:57,405 --> 00:54:59,426
Ken actually would reject those.

786
00:54:59,727 --> 00:55:03,769
So we went with smaller instruments, smaller drums.

787
00:55:04,129 --> 00:55:08,151
And sometimes Jim would record some drum and send it to me.

788
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:09,372
He goes, I think this is really cool.

789
00:55:09,412 --> 00:55:09,892
And I'd go, OK.

790
00:55:09,932 --> 00:55:11,593
And I'd make a whole sample library out of it

791
00:55:11,993 --> 00:55:12,834
and would use it.

792
00:55:13,774 --> 00:55:14,215
And they were.

793
00:55:14,795 --> 00:55:19,379
pretty they were pretty simple sounding it might just be a tom-tom like in a

794
00:55:19,759 --> 00:55:21,200
basic tom-tom like from

795
00:55:22,341 --> 00:55:28,346
Indian tom-tom or something like that, but there was just something cool about that that just was very effective. We just again we just

796
00:55:29,286 --> 00:55:34,210
Upset the applecart and and went in a direction that was quite different, and and I thought it was very effective

797
00:55:35,191 --> 00:55:35,871
Thank you sure

798
00:55:37,689 --> 00:55:46,054
Hi. Very early on in the combat in the game, there's a sequence of events as Booker's firing his pistol.

799
00:55:46,515 --> 00:55:52,959
First it's just a shot, and then it's a shot with a piano stab, and then the third shot is with like orchestral or string layers.

800
00:55:53,719 --> 00:55:59,283
How did that come about? I think it's brilliant. It invokes fear at first and then empowerment.

801
00:56:00,844 --> 00:56:02,065
That's, I mean, that's probably...

802
00:56:02,857 --> 00:56:06,980
Jim Bonney just taking my material and using it in really creative, cool ways.

803
00:56:07,120 --> 00:56:12,264
Yeah, it seemed to cross between being music and sound design and implementing.

804
00:56:12,324 --> 00:56:18,028
Yeah, he was, I mean, that's the cool thing about having a full-time music director like Nathan.

805
00:56:18,328 --> 00:56:24,573
You know, they can focus totally on the music and think about it sometimes for a year or two.

806
00:56:25,013 --> 00:56:26,174
So, very creative.

807
00:56:26,894 --> 00:56:30,638
solutions like that can be found.

808
00:56:31,059 --> 00:56:34,282
And he was asking for a lot of different things from me,

809
00:56:34,322 --> 00:56:37,185
some of which I didn't even know how exactly they'd get used

810
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:39,347
and didn't know until I saw them in use.

811
00:56:39,767 --> 00:56:40,348
Cool, thanks.

812
00:56:40,628 --> 00:56:40,788
Sure.

813
00:56:44,772 --> 00:56:46,713
First off, I want to thank you for composing A Louder Than Air.

814
00:56:46,733 --> 00:56:47,373
It's fantastic.

815
00:56:48,554 --> 00:56:49,875
My question is one of inspiration.

816
00:56:50,336 --> 00:56:52,577
I guess in sort of some unfair comparisons,

817
00:56:54,999 --> 00:56:57,060
the combat music is like that of Johnny Greenwood.

818
00:56:57,100 --> 00:56:58,421
And for me especially, it's sort of

819
00:56:58,982 --> 00:57:01,043
that there will be blood score where that oil derrick is

820
00:57:01,063 --> 00:57:01,663
burning down.

821
00:57:01,703 --> 00:57:03,965
And I've seen that compared in a few articles.

822
00:57:04,005 --> 00:57:06,006
And I know that Mr. Levine is a huge film head.

823
00:57:06,707 --> 00:57:08,948
So in terms of inspiration, do you ever

824
00:57:09,029 --> 00:57:09,829
look at anything like that?

825
00:57:10,049 --> 00:57:12,051
Or do you try to keep everything that's been done before?

826
00:57:13,024 --> 00:57:14,845
I like that score for Let There Be Blood.

827
00:57:15,745 --> 00:57:20,546
I was writing aleatoric music before that score existed,

828
00:57:20,626 --> 00:57:26,327
certainly, so it wasn't an epiphany for me

829
00:57:26,387 --> 00:57:28,508
to hear that score, but I thought it was very effective.

830
00:57:29,548 --> 00:57:31,309
I love that score, that Johnny Greenwood score.

831
00:57:32,149 --> 00:57:32,529
Very cool.

832
00:57:32,789 --> 00:57:32,969
Thanks.

833
00:57:35,458 --> 00:57:37,839
Hi Gary, it's sort of similar to his question,

834
00:57:37,859 --> 00:57:40,721
but I was curious for either the aleatoric elements

835
00:57:40,901 --> 00:57:42,542
or the more tonal string writing,

836
00:57:42,582 --> 00:57:45,344
did you look to any classical pieces for inspiration to?

837
00:57:45,364 --> 00:57:48,426
Well, I listened to a lot of Stephen Foster

838
00:57:49,026 --> 00:57:53,809
for the one cue that I,

839
00:57:54,330 --> 00:58:00,434
and also the New World Symphony.

840
00:58:01,168 --> 00:58:04,070
because I thought that had a very Americana vibe to it.

841
00:58:04,191 --> 00:58:05,692
And also Charles Ives.

842
00:58:06,112 --> 00:58:06,853
Oh, okay.

843
00:58:06,913 --> 00:58:08,975
As well, because I thought, I mean,

844
00:58:09,015 --> 00:58:10,656
Charles Ives really wrote a lot

845
00:58:10,676 --> 00:58:12,198
of really cool Americana music.

846
00:58:12,738 --> 00:58:14,360
So those were also inspirations for me.

847
00:58:14,620 --> 00:58:15,421
That's great, thank you.

848
00:58:15,701 --> 00:58:15,841
Sure.

849
00:58:19,260 --> 00:58:19,820
Thanks for this.

850
00:58:19,840 --> 00:58:20,961
Sure.

851
00:58:21,762 --> 00:58:28,387
You know, regarding the whole montage of aleatoric, these little aleatoric pieces, and you mentioned

852
00:58:28,648 --> 00:58:30,969
putting them together in different ways, did you ever...

853
00:58:33,190 --> 00:58:40,472
Did you ever have them or the music system actually sort of splice them in a random fashion or were they always

854
00:58:40,492 --> 00:58:47,215
You sort of placing them together in the way that sounded best. No, I I really picked

855
00:58:47,235 --> 00:58:51,116
I picked them out very specifically for their effectiveness

856
00:58:51,556 --> 00:58:55,318
I don't think a music system would have put them together in a creative way

857
00:58:55,578 --> 00:58:58,639
I mean, it's possible that they could if you program the hell out of it

858
00:58:58,959 --> 00:59:01,080
you might find some really cool way to do that.

859
00:59:01,501 --> 00:59:05,243
But that was not what was done in this case.

860
00:59:05,383 --> 00:59:08,345
It was really me just overlapping and just finding something

861
00:59:08,365 --> 00:59:12,127
that just really felt chaotic and crazy and effective.

862
00:59:12,867 --> 00:59:13,468
Awesome, thanks.

863
00:59:13,688 --> 00:59:13,848
Sure.

864
00:59:16,697 --> 00:59:20,299
Hi. First of all, thank you very much for the music of Bioshock. It's fantastic.

865
00:59:21,939 --> 00:59:25,601
So, when you approached Infinite, did you really want it to...

866
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:28,281
and I know that there was a level in Infinite that actually had Rapture in it,

867
00:59:28,382 --> 00:59:33,243
but did you approach it sort of wanting it to feel like an extension of the Bioshock universe?

868
00:59:33,263 --> 00:59:36,745
Like, did you want it to have music similar enough to the first one that it was relatable,

869
00:59:36,765 --> 00:59:38,445
or did you sort of want it to be its own new thing?

870
00:59:38,685 --> 00:59:41,989
No, I really, it needed to be, and I wanted it to be,

871
00:59:42,009 --> 00:59:43,991
a completely fresh and unique score.

872
00:59:44,031 --> 00:59:46,134
Because it's, other than that one cue

873
00:59:46,174 --> 00:59:47,495
where you actually end up in rapture,

874
00:59:48,136 --> 00:59:49,738
it really, as far as I was concerned,

875
00:59:49,758 --> 00:59:52,200
and certainly as far as the entire team at Irrational,

876
00:59:52,541 --> 00:59:54,423
it needed to have its own unique sound.

877
00:59:55,124 --> 00:59:55,644
It really did.

878
00:59:55,664 --> 00:59:56,565
Thank you.

879
00:59:57,026 --> 00:59:57,166
Sure.

880
00:59:59,380 --> 01:00:00,582
Hey, just a more quick question.

881
01:00:00,963 --> 01:00:04,208
So I noticed you got a lot of crazy sounds out of the strings.

882
01:00:04,408 --> 01:00:07,092
So were there any things that just kind of like came up in the studio,

883
01:00:07,112 --> 01:00:09,776
just unplanned, that you just kind of kept in because you liked it?

884
01:00:10,457 --> 01:00:11,078
What, say that again?

885
01:00:12,363 --> 01:00:16,448
I know you said you planned out a lot of the bizarre string parts.

886
01:00:16,508 --> 01:00:16,789
Yeah.

887
01:00:17,089 --> 01:00:20,353
I was asking if there's anything that just kind of came up that you didn't plan,

888
01:00:20,393 --> 01:00:22,056
that you really liked and just kind of kept going.

889
01:00:22,216 --> 01:00:23,317
You get surprises all the time.

890
01:00:23,337 --> 01:00:26,201
When you're recording live instruments, especially stuff like this,

891
01:00:26,302 --> 01:00:27,383
you do get surprises.

892
01:00:27,523 --> 01:00:29,506
And then you say, hey, whatever you just did.

893
01:00:30,127 --> 01:00:30,787
Do that again.

894
01:00:31,328 --> 01:00:32,369
That was very cool.

895
01:00:32,669 --> 01:00:36,512
Yeah, and that is the beauty of working with real musicians.

896
01:00:37,513 --> 01:00:39,855
I love that part of it, because you never know what they're

897
01:00:39,875 --> 01:00:40,696
going to come up with.

898
01:00:40,736 --> 01:00:42,898
You never know how they're going to take your music

899
01:00:43,299 --> 01:00:47,282
and do some really cool, unique thing that you did not expect.

900
01:00:47,823 --> 01:00:51,666
And I want that from the players, the live players

901
01:00:52,066 --> 01:00:52,707
that I work with.

902
01:00:53,528 --> 01:00:56,631
I want them to experiment and to try unique things.

903
01:00:58,695 --> 01:00:59,597
But that's the best.

904
01:00:59,637 --> 01:01:01,761
That's the most fun part.

905
01:01:03,205 --> 01:01:03,525
Thank you.

906
01:01:03,866 --> 01:01:04,047
Sure.

907
01:01:05,510 --> 01:01:06,712
All right, well, thank you all.

908
01:01:07,093 --> 01:01:07,695
Thanks for coming.
