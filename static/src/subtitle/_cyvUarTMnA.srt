1
00:00:06,467 --> 00:00:08,508
So I'm Bill Harms, I'm the narrative director at Hangar 13,

2
00:00:08,508 --> 00:00:10,009
and I was the lead writer on Mafia III.

3
00:00:10,009 --> 00:00:12,630
And the talk I'm giving today is called

4
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,290
The Most Turbulent of Years,

5
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:16,051
Creating the Characters in the World of Mafia III.

6
00:00:16,051 --> 00:00:19,092
Before I get started, forgive me a little bit,

7
00:00:19,092 --> 00:00:20,893
I'm fighting a cold or something,

8
00:00:20,893 --> 00:00:22,693
so my voice is not super great,

9
00:00:22,693 --> 00:00:24,194
and I'll have to rely on my notes

10
00:00:24,194 --> 00:00:26,415
a little bit more than I normally would.

11
00:00:28,938 --> 00:00:31,240
Before I get started, I just want to let everyone know

12
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:34,561
that this talk deals with sensitive subject matter,

13
00:00:34,561 --> 00:00:36,602
including discussions of race

14
00:00:36,602 --> 00:00:38,523
and the use of racist language,

15
00:00:38,523 --> 00:00:41,465
specifically how we used it while developing Mafia 3.

16
00:00:41,465 --> 00:00:48,168
So Mafia 3, it was released on October 7th of last year

17
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,510
on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC.

18
00:00:51,510 --> 00:00:54,751
And for those of you who aren't familiar,

19
00:00:56,382 --> 00:00:59,323
Mafia 3 is a pulpy revenge thriller.

20
00:00:59,323 --> 00:01:04,626
And I want to say, kind of off the bat, that it's not a story, the game's story is not

21
00:01:04,626 --> 00:01:05,427
about racism.

22
00:01:06,103 --> 00:01:08,064
or quote, unquote, even curing racism.

23
00:01:08,064 --> 00:01:13,406
But since racism permeates so much of who Lincoln Clay is,

24
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,668
because he's an African-American man living in the South in 1968,

25
00:01:17,668 --> 00:01:20,009
we felt that we had to include it in some way

26
00:01:20,009 --> 00:01:22,770
and address it and make it part of Lincoln's world.

27
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:25,191
So like I said, you play as Lincoln Clay.

28
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:26,772
He's a orphan.

29
00:01:26,772 --> 00:01:29,313
He's abandoned by his mother when he's around two.

30
00:01:29,313 --> 00:01:31,374
And he initially lives in a Catholic orphanage run

31
00:01:31,374 --> 00:01:33,095
by a man named Father James Ballard.

32
00:01:33,901 --> 00:01:36,363
When the city shuts down the orphanage,

33
00:01:36,363 --> 00:01:40,147
Lincoln's basically put out on the street.

34
00:01:40,147 --> 00:01:42,629
And at that point, he falls in with Sammy Robinson,

35
00:01:42,629 --> 00:01:46,532
who heads up the black mob in a section of the city called

36
00:01:46,532 --> 00:01:48,774
Delray Hollow, which is a predominantly

37
00:01:48,774 --> 00:01:50,996
African-American neighborhood.

38
00:01:50,996 --> 00:01:53,799
Sammy has a biological son named Ellis.

39
00:01:53,799 --> 00:01:56,341
And for all intents and purposes, they adopt Lincoln.

40
00:01:56,341 --> 00:01:57,943
He becomes part of their family.

41
00:01:59,237 --> 00:02:05,166
When Lincoln turns 18, he enlists in the army, he volunteers, and he goes to Vietnam.

42
00:02:05,166 --> 00:02:06,648
He's there for four years.

43
00:02:06,648 --> 00:02:09,673
During his time there, he's recruited into the special forces.

44
00:02:09,673 --> 00:02:12,237
Lincoln's honorably discharged.

45
00:02:12,237 --> 00:02:13,960
He's actually a highly decorated soldier.

46
00:02:14,731 --> 00:02:17,732
And when he returns home, his initial plan

47
00:02:17,732 --> 00:02:20,613
is to say goodbye to Sammy and Ellis

48
00:02:20,613 --> 00:02:23,674
and move to California and start a new life.

49
00:02:23,674 --> 00:02:27,555
Unfortunately, he finds out that Sammy owes the Italian mafia,

50
00:02:27,555 --> 00:02:29,755
which is led by a man named Sal Marcano.

51
00:02:29,755 --> 00:02:32,316
Sammy owes him a lot of money.

52
00:02:32,316 --> 00:02:34,657
So Lincoln decides that he's going to stick around,

53
00:02:34,657 --> 00:02:37,298
help Sammy make things right, and then he's going to go.

54
00:02:37,298 --> 00:02:41,039
As you'd expect, when you deal with a mob,

55
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,539
things don't go according to plan.

56
00:02:43,087 --> 00:02:47,852
Sal Marcano betrays Lincoln, he murders Sammy and Ellis,

57
00:02:47,852 --> 00:02:50,374
and in this scene here, that's actually Sal's son, Georgie.

58
00:02:50,374 --> 00:02:52,896
They shoot Lincoln in the head and they leave him for dead.

59
00:02:52,896 --> 00:02:55,118
And this is essentially the inciting incident

60
00:02:55,118 --> 00:02:56,059
for the rest of the story.

61
00:02:56,059 --> 00:02:57,921
From that point on, Lincoln vows revenge,

62
00:02:57,921 --> 00:03:01,224
and the bulk of the game is him specifically targeting

63
00:03:01,224 --> 00:03:02,004
Sal Marcano's organization.

64
00:03:02,004 --> 00:03:02,925
So when we first started working on

65
00:03:09,581 --> 00:03:15,943
Mafia 3, we basically sat down and we tried to identify some of the key franchise pillars.

66
00:03:15,943 --> 00:03:20,004
And one of the most important ones that bubbled up pretty quickly is that the franchise is

67
00:03:20,004 --> 00:03:25,266
about capturing a specific time and place in American history and then providing, acting

68
00:03:25,266 --> 00:03:27,847
kind of as an entry point to that time and place for the player.

69
00:03:27,847 --> 00:03:32,628
So Mafia, the original game, was set in 1930s America.

70
00:03:32,628 --> 00:03:35,169
That's Depression era, it's a very different feel.

71
00:03:35,975 --> 00:03:40,977
than Mafia II, which was primarily set in post-war America.

72
00:03:40,977 --> 00:03:43,138
So it's more optimistic, the future's bright,

73
00:03:43,138 --> 00:03:45,199
everything's going okay.

74
00:03:45,199 --> 00:03:48,900
And Mafia III is set in New Bordeaux,

75
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,921
which is our version of New Orleans.

76
00:03:52,387 --> 00:03:57,690
in 1968. So again, it's a very, very different time and place than the first two games. You

77
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,613
have depression, post war, and the 1968, which I'll talk a little bit more about here in a

78
00:04:02,613 --> 00:04:08,837
second. But 1968 was one of the most turbulent years in American history, probably outside of

79
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:16,001
the Civil War. So, why Link and Clay? With the first two Mafia games, we already did, we

80
00:04:16,001 --> 00:04:18,443
already created the, um,

81
00:04:19,293 --> 00:04:22,618
Kind of typical mob story, especially Mafia 2,

82
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:27,245
is the very traditional rags to riches mob story.

83
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,909
In that case, Vito Scoletta, who gets in with a mob,

84
00:04:29,909 --> 00:04:32,273
and it's kind of his arc as he works his way up

85
00:04:32,273 --> 00:04:33,394
through the ranks.

86
00:04:35,165 --> 00:04:40,968
And Lincoln is a very different, obviously a very different protagonist,

87
00:04:40,968 --> 00:04:45,211
not just because of his race as an African American man, but also of his background.

88
00:04:45,211 --> 00:04:49,974
He's not somebody who was initially part of the Italian Mafia or things like that.

89
00:04:49,974 --> 00:04:51,836
He's very much kind of an outsider in that regard.

90
00:04:51,836 --> 00:04:56,959
And because he's an African American, he has a very specific way of viewing the world.

91
00:04:56,959 --> 00:05:00,161
And more importantly, the world has a very specific way of viewing him.

92
00:05:00,848 --> 00:05:03,571
And that's something we wanted to explore narratively,

93
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:05,292
which obviously lets us tell a very different

94
00:05:05,292 --> 00:05:06,013
type of mob story.

95
00:05:06,013 --> 00:05:10,777
And this also helps us reinforce the time and place.

96
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,159
Again, American South, 1968,

97
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:14,520
with an African American protagonist.

98
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:14,800
So why 1968?

99
00:05:21,325 --> 00:05:27,026
When people think of the 60s, they think of, I think, of several kind of massive historical

100
00:05:27,026 --> 00:05:29,747
touchstones, and a lot of those happened in 1968.

101
00:05:29,747 --> 00:05:34,708
That was the year Dr. King was assassinated, it was the year Bobby Kennedy was assassinated,

102
00:05:34,708 --> 00:05:40,729
it was the year of the Tet Offensive, the riots at the Democratic National Convention,

103
00:05:40,729 --> 00:05:44,990
the Black Power Salute at the Mexico City Olympics in October of that year.

104
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,570
So it's a very, very tumultuous time.

105
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:52,191
Vietnam was also going on, like I mentioned the Tet Offensive.

106
00:05:52,191 --> 00:05:56,373
It's also roughly the time when American soldiers started

107
00:05:56,373 --> 00:05:57,414
to return home.

108
00:05:57,414 --> 00:06:01,396
And the kind of rosy sheen of what was going on in Vietnam

109
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,996
started to disappear.

110
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:07,258
And social upheaval.

111
00:06:07,258 --> 00:06:12,801
Civil Rights Act passed in 1964, which obviously, culturally,

112
00:06:12,801 --> 00:06:14,282
had a massive impact.

113
00:06:14,282 --> 00:06:16,163
And this is a few years after that.

114
00:06:16,442 --> 00:06:18,343
People are still reacting to that,

115
00:06:18,343 --> 00:06:19,984
and I'll talk a little bit about those later.

116
00:06:19,984 --> 00:06:23,225
The Fair Housing Act portion of the Civil Rights Act

117
00:06:23,225 --> 00:06:23,825
passed in 1968.

118
00:06:23,825 --> 00:06:27,427
So there's still a lot of things culturally going on as well.

119
00:06:27,427 --> 00:06:27,787
Sorry about that.

120
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:28,808
So why New Bordeaux?

121
00:06:28,808 --> 00:06:35,771
Like I said before, it's our version of New Orleans.

122
00:06:35,771 --> 00:06:39,452
The fascinating thing about real New Orleans

123
00:06:39,452 --> 00:06:42,294
is it has a very long history of organized crime,

124
00:06:42,294 --> 00:06:44,415
dating back to just a few years after the Civil War.

125
00:06:44,924 --> 00:06:49,928
The Union Army couldn't control the dock, so they basically hired a criminal to do it for them.

126
00:06:49,928 --> 00:06:53,070
And that basically was the beginning of organized crime.

127
00:06:53,070 --> 00:06:59,614
Roughly the time that our game is set, the kind of godfather of the city was this man named Carlos Marcelo.

128
00:06:59,614 --> 00:07:03,297
And he's this larger than life crime boss.

129
00:07:03,297 --> 00:07:08,140
And if you have a moment, there's actually videos of him on YouTube testifying before Congress.

130
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:10,742
And literally pleading the fifth before everything.

131
00:07:10,742 --> 00:07:12,744
His name, what he did, the whole nine yards.

132
00:07:12,744 --> 00:07:14,345
So they're pretty amazing to watch.

133
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:20,985
And finally, New Bordeaux, you know, obviously, sorry,

134
00:07:20,985 --> 00:07:22,006
New Orleans was our inspiration.

135
00:07:22,006 --> 00:07:24,388
New Orleans is a very aspirational city.

136
00:07:24,388 --> 00:07:25,449
It's also very iconic.

137
00:07:25,449 --> 00:07:27,991
So you'd believe that a story like Mafia III

138
00:07:27,991 --> 00:07:29,873
could be set in a place like that.

139
00:07:29,873 --> 00:07:33,416
But it also, as I said, it's very iconic.

140
00:07:33,416 --> 00:07:35,778
So if you see an image like this,

141
00:07:35,778 --> 00:07:38,100
buildings with those kind of railings and things like that,

142
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,742
pretty much anybody can guess that that's New Orleans,

143
00:07:40,742 --> 00:07:42,003
regardless of where they come from.

144
00:07:46,136 --> 00:07:51,521
And finally we decided to frame the entire game narratively as a documentary.

145
00:07:51,521 --> 00:07:57,626
So what this means is we have specific sections in the game where we quote unquote interview

146
00:07:57,626 --> 00:08:04,152
characters modern day as they reflect back on the events of 1968 and what Lincoln Clay

147
00:08:04,152 --> 00:08:04,993
did in New Bordeaux.

148
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:09,388
That includes Father James and also Nikki Burke, who's the daughter of one of the

149
00:08:09,388 --> 00:08:11,850
underbosses that Lincoln recruits, named Thomas Burke.

150
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:17,794
And then we also have a Senate hearing, which you see here, with a character named John

151
00:08:17,794 --> 00:08:20,255
Donovan a few years after 1968, so in 1971.

152
00:08:20,756 --> 00:08:24,200
And the reason we did this is it's part of the franchise.

153
00:08:24,200 --> 00:08:29,366
The previous Mafia games had these, like Vito had his letters and things like that.

154
00:08:29,366 --> 00:08:35,293
It also grounds the story in what we think is a pretty realistic way, because it's a

155
00:08:35,293 --> 00:08:37,515
nice intersection between our world and the game world.

156
00:08:38,036 --> 00:08:40,578
We actually licensed images and video footage

157
00:08:40,578 --> 00:08:42,640
that played during the documentary segments,

158
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,322
and all of that is obviously what was happening

159
00:08:45,322 --> 00:08:45,662
in real 1968.

160
00:08:45,662 --> 00:08:47,564
And finally, for the writers,

161
00:08:47,564 --> 00:08:50,126
it's a great way to deliver exposition.

162
00:08:50,126 --> 00:08:54,209
Documentaries are inherently about delivering exposition

163
00:08:54,209 --> 00:08:56,331
because it's a question and answer,

164
00:08:56,331 --> 00:08:59,894
and so it's a great way to very kind of elegantly

165
00:08:59,894 --> 00:09:03,077
move the story along without it feeling really ham-fisted.

166
00:09:06,231 --> 00:09:07,392
So this was the big one.

167
00:09:07,392 --> 00:09:09,273
As we developed the game,

168
00:09:09,273 --> 00:09:11,094
one of the most important questions we asked

169
00:09:11,094 --> 00:09:14,016
is how do we infuse the game with events from that era?

170
00:09:14,016 --> 00:09:17,098
Protests, Vietnam War, Civil Rights Movement,

171
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,239
and even racism,

172
00:09:18,239 --> 00:09:20,620
without it coming across like we're preaching

173
00:09:20,620 --> 00:09:22,121
from a soapbox.

174
00:09:22,121 --> 00:09:25,984
So we had a lot of discussions about this,

175
00:09:25,984 --> 00:09:27,965
and in the end, we decided to address it

176
00:09:27,965 --> 00:09:29,566
across multiple disciplines,

177
00:09:29,566 --> 00:09:32,088
which I think is a big win for the team.

178
00:09:32,088 --> 00:09:35,450
Obviously, my focus is on the narrative aspects of the game,

179
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:38,432
but also touch on the other areas a little bit as well.

180
00:09:38,432 --> 00:09:41,953
The team also understood that what we were doing

181
00:09:41,953 --> 00:09:42,794
was very risky.

182
00:09:42,794 --> 00:09:45,115
Because if we didn't get it right,

183
00:09:45,115 --> 00:09:48,996
we not only do a disservice, in my opinion,

184
00:09:48,996 --> 00:09:50,097
not only do a disservice to everyone

185
00:09:50,097 --> 00:09:52,038
who worked on the game, but also to the people

186
00:09:52,038 --> 00:09:53,958
who lived through this specific time and place

187
00:09:53,958 --> 00:09:55,499
in American history.

188
00:09:59,013 --> 00:10:04,497
So as part of that process was research. So we really did a deep dive on

189
00:10:04,497 --> 00:10:07,118
researching the 1960s specifically 1968 and

190
00:10:07,118 --> 00:10:09,740
that took

191
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:15,284
Sorry that that basically ran across a

192
00:10:15,284 --> 00:10:21,248
Few types of media, so I'll talk about each one of these in turn. So there's documentaries. There's movies

193
00:10:21,248 --> 00:10:24,610
books and then also first-hand accounts from African Americans

194
00:10:26,235 --> 00:10:30,679
So in terms of the documentaries, the big one for me

195
00:10:30,679 --> 00:10:31,880
is Take This Hammer.

196
00:10:31,880 --> 00:10:34,062
It's a movie that James Baldwin made in 1963.

197
00:10:34,062 --> 00:10:35,603
It's actually set here in San Francisco.

198
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:39,527
And essentially, he goes around and interviews

199
00:10:39,527 --> 00:10:41,789
African-Americans about their daily lives,

200
00:10:41,789 --> 00:10:43,250
what it's like to live in San Francisco,

201
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:47,353
what it's like to live in the United States of America.

202
00:10:47,353 --> 00:10:50,816
Spies in Mississippi is about the Mississippi state

203
00:10:50,816 --> 00:10:53,759
government trying to infiltrate the civil rights movement.

204
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:57,253
And I don't know if it's still true, but it was,

205
00:10:57,253 --> 00:10:59,696
I believe it's still true that it was the largest

206
00:10:59,696 --> 00:11:05,422
state-sponsored surveillance that ever happened

207
00:11:05,422 --> 00:11:06,203
in this country.

208
00:11:06,203 --> 00:11:08,085
And then the game is Mafia III.

209
00:11:08,085 --> 00:11:10,047
So we have to look into criminality and criminals

210
00:11:10,047 --> 00:11:10,688
and how they work.

211
00:11:10,688 --> 00:11:13,451
So Mr. Untouchable is Nicky Barnes.

212
00:11:13,451 --> 00:11:15,893
He was a huge crime figure in New York.

213
00:11:17,215 --> 00:11:22,556
Cocaine Cowboys, even though Cocaine Cowboys is about the rise of the cocaine trade in

214
00:11:22,556 --> 00:11:27,758
America in the 1980s, specifically a man named John Roberts, it again provided a nice glimpse

215
00:11:27,758 --> 00:11:30,139
into basically how the criminal mind works.

216
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:37,441
In terms of movies, American Gangster, which was a movie with Russell Crowe and turned

217
00:11:37,441 --> 00:11:42,383
into a movie with Russell Crowe and Denzel Washington, about a man named Frank Lucas

218
00:11:42,383 --> 00:11:44,503
who was a contemporary of Nicky Barnes.

219
00:11:45,888 --> 00:11:48,989
The usual things, good fellows, godfather.

220
00:11:48,989 --> 00:11:54,070
And then since Lincoln is a Vietnam veteran, we also wanted to look

221
00:11:54,070 --> 00:11:57,331
into the Vietnam experience and what it would be like to, A,

222
00:11:57,331 --> 00:12:00,192
serve there and then also what it's like to come home.

223
00:12:00,192 --> 00:12:02,353
So platoon, full metal jacket.

224
00:12:02,353 --> 00:12:07,694
In terms of books, these ran the range from fiction books to nonfiction.

225
00:12:07,694 --> 00:12:12,836
So there's a novel called Matterhorn, which is a fictional account of.

226
00:12:13,227 --> 00:12:16,710
basically about three months on the ground in Vietnam,

227
00:12:16,710 --> 00:12:18,511
but it was written by a combat vet.

228
00:12:18,511 --> 00:12:21,534
The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien,

229
00:12:21,534 --> 00:12:24,396
which is an amazing book.

230
00:12:24,396 --> 00:12:26,237
And then again, touching on the criminality

231
00:12:26,237 --> 00:12:28,319
of the Parker novels by George Stark.

232
00:12:28,319 --> 00:12:31,882
The novels of George V. Higgins,

233
00:12:31,882 --> 00:12:33,843
Friends of Eddie Coyle, if anybody's read that.

234
00:12:33,843 --> 00:12:36,025
And then American Desperado.

235
00:12:36,025 --> 00:12:38,647
This is actually the biography of John Roberts,

236
00:12:38,647 --> 00:12:40,629
who I said was the subject of Coking Cowboys.

237
00:12:41,407 --> 00:12:45,369
And the great thing about something like this is you literally cannot make up the crazy

238
00:12:45,369 --> 00:12:46,890
stuff they did.

239
00:12:46,890 --> 00:12:50,672
So it provides a great glimpse again into that life of being a criminal and kind of

240
00:12:50,672 --> 00:12:53,213
where their moral compass is directed.

241
00:12:53,213 --> 00:12:59,497
And then Double Deal is about a man who is made the chief of police of a small town outside

242
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:01,678
of Chicago and he's placed there by the mob.

243
00:13:02,464 --> 00:13:05,167
And it really goes into the nitty gritty of what that's like.

244
00:13:05,167 --> 00:13:06,888
And one of the things we learned from this

245
00:13:06,888 --> 00:13:09,691
is how much money the mob makes from illegal gambling.

246
00:13:09,691 --> 00:13:11,793
And a side note, he actually did more

247
00:13:11,793 --> 00:13:14,035
to improve the police department than any of his predecessors.

248
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:16,197
And he was totally in the pocket of the mob.

249
00:13:16,197 --> 00:13:21,342
So I'll take a drink and let everyone read this.

250
00:13:32,367 --> 00:13:34,548
So for those of you who don't know who Jim Brown is,

251
00:13:34,548 --> 00:13:36,428
he's the running back for the Cleveland Browns.

252
00:13:36,428 --> 00:13:37,709
I'm a Browns fan, so to me,

253
00:13:37,709 --> 00:13:41,111
he's the greatest football player who ever lived.

254
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:42,911
He went on to be an actor and activist.

255
00:13:42,911 --> 00:13:45,493
This is actually an excerpt from an interview

256
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:47,614
he gave with Alex Haley, the author of Roots,

257
00:13:47,614 --> 00:13:49,714
that was published in Playboy Magazine in February 1968.

258
00:13:49,714 --> 00:13:53,096
And essentially, the entire interview

259
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:55,957
is the two of them discussing what it's like

260
00:13:55,957 --> 00:13:57,958
to be an African American man in America.

261
00:14:00,733 --> 00:14:06,317
I won't say that this is, I'm using this as an example of a lot of the first-hand accounts

262
00:14:06,317 --> 00:14:07,978
that we researched and that we read about.

263
00:14:07,978 --> 00:14:13,102
But it's also, I think, one of the most visceral because literally he was driving with some

264
00:14:13,102 --> 00:14:16,684
of his friends and they get pulled over because their car threw dust on white people.

265
00:14:16,684 --> 00:14:22,288
And even though this happened, I believe, in 1957, you know, those sorts of things were

266
00:14:22,288 --> 00:14:26,290
still going on, which obviously has resonance in 1968.

267
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:30,972
And these first-hand accounts like this

268
00:14:30,972 --> 00:14:34,455
did have a direct impact on how we characterized

269
00:14:34,455 --> 00:14:36,197
some of the characters in the game

270
00:14:36,197 --> 00:14:37,778
and also some of the gameplay systems,

271
00:14:37,778 --> 00:14:38,719
which I'll get to in a second.

272
00:14:38,719 --> 00:14:42,582
And finally, one last thing we did for research

273
00:14:42,582 --> 00:14:44,643
is we actually made a giant Excel spreadsheet

274
00:14:44,643 --> 00:14:47,005
that listed pretty much every major event

275
00:14:47,005 --> 00:14:49,707
that happened in 1968, so it was a nice thing to go back to.

276
00:14:52,908 --> 00:14:58,010
So for the characters in the game, we talked a lot about how to make them reflect the era

277
00:14:58,010 --> 00:15:02,072
of Mafia III, while at the same time ensuring that the characters didn't feel like they

278
00:15:02,072 --> 00:15:03,033
were beholden to history.

279
00:15:03,033 --> 00:15:08,655
So what we did is we started with their narrative purpose, and then that real world history

280
00:15:08,655 --> 00:15:14,718
and that character's opinion of that history further defined them in terms of their personality

281
00:15:14,718 --> 00:15:16,039
and also the opinions that they had.

282
00:15:16,039 --> 00:15:21,041
And then from that point on, we basically did it, you know, it's just taking creative

283
00:15:21,041 --> 00:15:21,402
license.

284
00:15:22,085 --> 00:15:27,088
I'm not going to go into every character in the game, just a few that I think kind of

285
00:15:27,088 --> 00:15:27,968
best exemplify this.

286
00:15:27,968 --> 00:15:34,312
I will say one of the big lessons we learned is do not be afraid to write characters that

287
00:15:34,312 --> 00:15:36,893
you disagree with.

288
00:15:36,893 --> 00:15:40,656
There's some pretty reprehensible characters in this game, they were hard to write, but

289
00:15:40,656 --> 00:15:45,358
we felt that they were very important to include as a part of the game story because, again,

290
00:15:45,358 --> 00:15:47,460
they helped establish a specific time and place.

291
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,342
So the first is Father James Ballard.

292
00:15:53,342 --> 00:15:56,303
Narratively, his role is basically,

293
00:15:56,303 --> 00:15:58,905
he's the quote-unquote angel on Lincoln's shoulder.

294
00:15:58,905 --> 00:16:02,767
So he ran the orphanage where Lincoln lived

295
00:16:02,767 --> 00:16:04,028
for about eight years or so,

296
00:16:04,028 --> 00:16:06,589
and then he also still has a place

297
00:16:06,589 --> 00:16:07,910
in Lincoln's life after that.

298
00:16:07,910 --> 00:16:12,173
And he warns Lincoln, and by extension the player,

299
00:16:12,173 --> 00:16:14,374
about taking things too far,

300
00:16:14,374 --> 00:16:16,695
about turning into the thing that you hate.

301
00:16:16,695 --> 00:16:19,677
But he also provides important narrative context.

302
00:16:20,205 --> 00:16:22,948
because he fought in World War II, he was a medic,

303
00:16:22,948 --> 00:16:27,432
and he was part of a segregated unit that took part

304
00:16:27,432 --> 00:16:29,574
in the battle for a French town called Klimbach,

305
00:16:29,574 --> 00:16:33,037
and that was actually the 3rd Platoon Company C.

306
00:16:33,037 --> 00:16:35,419
And that experience is basically what prompted him

307
00:16:35,419 --> 00:16:38,863
to become a priest, and it also defined his worldview

308
00:16:38,863 --> 00:16:41,805
from that point on, not only in terms of race,

309
00:16:41,805 --> 00:16:44,247
but also in terms of America as a whole.

310
00:16:45,248 --> 00:16:48,692
And he's the primary focus of the documentary footage

311
00:16:48,692 --> 00:16:50,193
that I mentioned earlier.

312
00:16:50,193 --> 00:16:54,618
And after you eliminate each of the three capos that

313
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:57,061
report up to Sal Marcano, we cut to Father James.

314
00:16:57,061 --> 00:16:59,484
And he not only provides kind of commentary

315
00:16:59,484 --> 00:17:02,327
on what Lincoln's doing, but he also provides relevant thoughts

316
00:17:02,327 --> 00:17:04,950
on what he thinks is happening in America.

317
00:17:07,882 --> 00:17:14,007
This is John Donovan. He's a CI agent that Lincoln met when he was in Vietnam.

318
00:17:14,007 --> 00:17:19,032
The two of them, there were these things called provincial reconnaissance units,

319
00:17:19,032 --> 00:17:25,778
and basically they would recruit and use indigenous peoples in Vietnam to fight the VC,

320
00:17:25,778 --> 00:17:29,921
and Lincoln and Donovan team up to take part in that.

321
00:17:29,921 --> 00:17:34,826
And he's the, if Father James is the angel on Lincoln's shoulder, Donovan is the devil.

322
00:17:35,428 --> 00:17:39,930
He believes that the ends justifies the means, and that Lincoln has every right to do whatever

323
00:17:39,930 --> 00:17:41,931
he needs to do in order to bring down Sal Marcano.

324
00:17:41,931 --> 00:17:45,973
And like Father James, Donovan's character was shaped by history.

325
00:17:45,973 --> 00:17:51,576
At that time, CI agents typically were East Coast elites.

326
00:17:51,576 --> 00:17:54,617
They were men who went to Ivy League colleges.

327
00:17:54,617 --> 00:17:56,038
And that's the world he comes from.

328
00:17:56,735 --> 00:17:59,557
He's also violently anti-Southern,

329
00:17:59,557 --> 00:18:02,480
which is something that I don't think anybody ever mentioned,

330
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:03,681
which is kind of surprising to me.

331
00:18:03,681 --> 00:18:07,224
He makes several references to the Civil War,

332
00:18:07,224 --> 00:18:10,527
Reconstruction, and at one point he even says

333
00:18:10,527 --> 00:18:13,149
that President Andrew Johnson should have

334
00:18:13,149 --> 00:18:14,871
hanged all the traitors after the Civil War

335
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:16,452
and the country had been better off.

336
00:18:16,452 --> 00:18:19,995
So in other words, he's a proper Yankee.

337
00:18:19,995 --> 00:18:22,237
But he also represents the era in another important way.

338
00:18:22,971 --> 00:18:28,093
And that comes across because he deeply distrusts the government and is openly hostile to what

339
00:18:28,093 --> 00:18:33,035
he sees as the cronies and yes-men who essentially man the levers of power.

340
00:18:33,035 --> 00:18:38,077
And this is a shift that really took part in the 60s as we kind of went from trusting

341
00:18:38,077 --> 00:18:41,978
our government to not trusting our government, and he represents that.

342
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:43,439
His attitude is really…

343
00:18:44,970 --> 00:18:49,754
are reflected in his documentary segment, which is him testifying before a top secret

344
00:18:49,754 --> 00:18:50,455
Senate panel in 1971.

345
00:18:50,455 --> 00:18:53,777
He absolutely loathes everyone in that room.

346
00:18:53,777 --> 00:18:58,762
He thinks they're all cowards and traitors and that they put their own interests in front

347
00:18:58,762 --> 00:19:00,764
of the interests of the country at large.

348
00:19:00,764 --> 00:19:01,224
So Cassandra is...

349
00:19:06,198 --> 00:19:10,942
She's the head of the Haitian gang, which is initially in opposition to Lincoln, and

350
00:19:10,942 --> 00:19:15,125
later on he recruits her to be one of his three underbosses who assists him in his war

351
00:19:15,125 --> 00:19:16,786
against Sao Marcano.

352
00:19:16,786 --> 00:19:22,850
And she's a black militant, but for her it's more individualized.

353
00:19:22,850 --> 00:19:27,934
So her primary focus is what's going on in the city and how that directly impacts the

354
00:19:27,934 --> 00:19:31,276
lives of her and also the other members of Del Rey Hollow.

355
00:19:31,276 --> 00:19:35,599
So to her, the struggle for equality is deeply individualized.

356
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:41,982
The other interesting thing about Cassandra is that you're either with her or against her,

357
00:19:41,982 --> 00:19:45,204
and this is what drives her actions in the early parts of the game,

358
00:19:45,204 --> 00:19:50,066
because she essentially sees Sammy, who's the former head of the Black Mob

359
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:55,469
and Lincoln's adoptive father, she basically sees him as a traitor to his race because he kicks

360
00:19:55,469 --> 00:19:58,650
up to a white man, Sal Marcono, the head of the Italian Mafia.

361
00:19:58,650 --> 00:20:03,953
And this attitude even extends to other members of the Haitians, including a man named Baca,

362
00:20:03,953 --> 00:20:07,375
who tells Lincoln at one point, quote, black men shouldn't answer to white men.

363
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:12,183
And it's also worth mentioning Cassandra's opinion on guns.

364
00:20:12,183 --> 00:20:15,525
Her open world activity is centered around obtaining them

365
00:20:15,525 --> 00:20:18,808
so that she can distribute them to the people of Delray Hollow

366
00:20:18,808 --> 00:20:21,510
so they can use them in defense.

367
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:24,893
And gun control essentially has its origins in racism.

368
00:20:24,893 --> 00:20:28,115
African-Americans were restricted from owning firearms

369
00:20:28,115 --> 00:20:29,556
after the Civil War.

370
00:20:29,556 --> 00:20:31,438
And there was a Gun Control Act passed in 1968

371
00:20:31,438 --> 00:20:35,581
that was also widely seen as targeting African-Americans

372
00:20:35,581 --> 00:20:37,062
and restricting their right to guns.

373
00:20:37,062 --> 00:20:38,883
So Cassandra's.

374
00:20:40,091 --> 00:20:43,854
Open world activity is a direct reflection of that.

375
00:20:43,854 --> 00:20:47,337
And at one point, her and Lincoln have a conversation where she even says,

376
00:20:47,337 --> 00:20:48,898
there's a tragedy that happens in her life.

377
00:20:48,898 --> 00:20:53,221
And she actually says, if I would have had a gun, that wouldn't have happened.

378
00:20:53,221 --> 00:20:59,086
So again, using history to very much inform her worldview.

379
00:20:59,086 --> 00:21:01,148
Sal Marcano is the head of the Italian mafia.

380
00:21:01,148 --> 00:21:04,490
He's the man who betrays Lincoln and kills Sammy and Ellis.

381
00:21:05,157 --> 00:21:10,999
And one of the things that you learn over the course of the game is that Sal Marcono

382
00:21:10,999 --> 00:21:12,300
wants out of this so-called life.

383
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,460
He wants to go legit.

384
00:21:13,460 --> 00:21:16,821
So his plan is to build a casino north of the city.

385
00:21:16,821 --> 00:21:21,603
And one of the reasons he does this is that he instinctually understands that the world

386
00:21:21,603 --> 00:21:25,685
is changing and that the old order is under assault.

387
00:21:27,942 --> 00:21:29,703
And that's just not the world at large.

388
00:21:29,703 --> 00:21:31,503
That's also including his world, which

389
00:21:31,503 --> 00:21:34,604
is the world of criminality, which Lincoln represents.

390
00:21:34,604 --> 00:21:38,344
Historically in the late 60s, that roughly

391
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:40,605
marks the beginning of the end of the golden age

392
00:21:40,605 --> 00:21:42,845
for the Italian mafia in America.

393
00:21:42,845 --> 00:21:44,826
And Sal knows it's coming.

394
00:21:44,826 --> 00:21:46,886
And so the mafia, which is essentially

395
00:21:46,886 --> 00:21:49,406
at that point an institution, like every other institution

396
00:21:49,406 --> 00:21:50,967
in the country, it was under assault

397
00:21:50,967 --> 00:21:52,747
over the course of the 60s.

398
00:21:53,693 --> 00:21:56,494
and it will not survive in its current form.

399
00:21:56,494 --> 00:22:00,576
And like I said, that's something that Sal understands.

400
00:22:00,576 --> 00:22:04,117
I go on and on talking about some of the other characters,

401
00:22:04,117 --> 00:22:06,518
like we have a woman named Nikki,

402
00:22:06,518 --> 00:22:08,178
and her sexuality is a part of the game.

403
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:10,259
There's also a man named Emmanuel,

404
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:16,281
he escaped Haiti and he works for Cassandra.

405
00:22:16,281 --> 00:22:19,462
And so there's a part of his backstory involves

406
00:22:19,462 --> 00:22:22,163
Papa Doc Duvalier, who was the dictator in Haiti.

407
00:22:22,668 --> 00:22:27,070
and he tells the player's story about how he used to smuggle people out of Haiti,

408
00:22:27,070 --> 00:22:29,511
and that's essentially how he ended up in America.

409
00:22:29,511 --> 00:22:35,855
But hopefully you see from these examples basically how, like I said before,

410
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:41,778
we used history to kind of help define who they are and let that guide some of their opinions.

411
00:22:41,778 --> 00:22:42,338
So the world.

412
00:22:43,906 --> 00:22:49,309
As I mentioned before, the story for Mafia III is not about racism, it's about Lincoln

413
00:22:49,309 --> 00:22:51,290
Clay getting revenge on the Italian Mafia.

414
00:22:51,290 --> 00:22:56,613
And we went to great lengths to ensure that we never lost sight of that very simple through

415
00:22:56,613 --> 00:22:56,734
line.

416
00:22:56,734 --> 00:23:00,055
And there are a couple reasons for this.

417
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,497
First of all, the game is part of the Mafia franchise.

418
00:23:02,497 --> 00:23:04,198
And at its core, it had to be a pulpy crime story.

419
00:23:04,198 --> 00:23:08,961
Even though I like Lincoln Clay and I feel bad for what happened to him, he is a criminal.

420
00:23:08,961 --> 00:23:10,201
All of his friends are criminals.

421
00:23:10,201 --> 00:23:11,902
That is the world he inhabits.

422
00:23:12,719 --> 00:23:16,320
And like I said before, we didn't want to climb up on a soapbox and preach.

423
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:23,902
Instead, we decided it's much more powerful if we made the elements of 1968 as part of

424
00:23:23,902 --> 00:23:29,963
the world and exposed those to the characters and then let the characters essentially interact

425
00:23:29,963 --> 00:23:32,364
with that world and see what happens.

426
00:23:32,364 --> 00:23:36,185
And it also, we think, made it feel more real and organic.

427
00:23:36,185 --> 00:23:39,585
And since Mafia III is an open world game...

428
00:23:40,749 --> 00:23:45,332
We decided to use that to our advantage and create a city that could only exist in 1968.

429
00:23:45,332 --> 00:23:48,894
So pedestrians, the police, enemies, and the radio were all powerful tools

430
00:23:48,894 --> 00:23:51,695
that we tried to use for maximum effect.

431
00:23:51,695 --> 00:23:54,317
And there is some overlap in each of these areas,

432
00:23:54,317 --> 00:23:56,658
but I'll go through them each one at a time.

433
00:23:56,658 --> 00:23:59,220
So the first is pedestrians.

434
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:03,142
This is actually a scene early on in the game.

435
00:24:03,142 --> 00:24:07,104
Those women right there are actually talking about the extradition of James Earl Ray,

436
00:24:07,104 --> 00:24:08,805
who was the man who assassinated Dr. King.

437
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:14,407
And we wrote hundreds of conversations. And although a lot of them discussed things like

438
00:24:14,407 --> 00:24:19,491
the already mentioned extradition of James Earl Ray or the biracial kiss on Star Trek, we

439
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:24,395
intentionally included a lot of conversations that did not mention race, Vietnam or

440
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:32,762
anything that would closely align with that era. And the reason we did this is that if every

441
00:24:32,762 --> 00:24:37,946
pedestrian was either a racist or war protestor or just talking about how the country's

442
00:24:37,946 --> 00:24:38,607
going to hell.

443
00:24:39,328 --> 00:24:43,936
In our opinion, New Bordeaux wouldn't have felt like a real grounded place.

444
00:24:43,936 --> 00:24:48,445
People talk about other things than just immediate history that's going on.

445
00:24:49,223 --> 00:24:52,084
And we also felt that it would have diluted the moments

446
00:24:52,084 --> 00:24:54,565
where characters in the game do discuss

447
00:24:54,565 --> 00:24:55,826
era-specific topics.

448
00:24:55,826 --> 00:24:58,167
So this is why we have folks telling jokes.

449
00:24:58,167 --> 00:25:01,048
There's two guys talking about their friend

450
00:25:01,048 --> 00:25:04,089
who had a heart attack and why he was tending his pigs,

451
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:05,010
which had a very bad ending.

452
00:25:05,010 --> 00:25:09,231
And then my personal favorite is we actually have guys

453
00:25:09,231 --> 00:25:12,653
telling era-specific urban legends.

454
00:25:12,653 --> 00:25:15,354
So even if the player doesn't know that that's from 1968,

455
00:25:15,354 --> 00:25:16,755
everyone has heard of urban legend.

456
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:29,484
So one of the other things we, as a part of that,

457
00:25:29,484 --> 00:25:33,147
we also have systemic lines from pedestrians

458
00:25:33,147 --> 00:25:34,648
that are directed at the player

459
00:25:34,648 --> 00:25:36,789
as they travel through the game world.

460
00:25:36,789 --> 00:25:39,491
And one of the things we, obviously,

461
00:25:39,491 --> 00:25:42,033
part of that is racist language, unfortunately.

462
00:25:42,033 --> 00:25:44,355
But we tried to model it in a way that it felt natural

463
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:46,636
and was based on the location of the city

464
00:25:46,636 --> 00:25:47,777
where you were currently at.

465
00:25:51,218 --> 00:25:54,420
And so the context of the city, so the likelihood

466
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:56,141
of hearing those lines would go up or down

467
00:25:56,141 --> 00:25:57,461
depending on where you were,

468
00:25:57,461 --> 00:26:01,763
and this was determined by a percentage chance.

469
00:26:01,763 --> 00:26:04,905
So in Frisco Fields, which is a rich white enclave

470
00:26:04,905 --> 00:26:06,906
in the city, there's a 70% chance

471
00:26:06,906 --> 00:26:09,327
that racist characters would spawn.

472
00:26:09,327 --> 00:26:12,208
In Delray Hollow, which is where Lincoln is from,

473
00:26:12,208 --> 00:26:12,788
there's a 0% chance.

474
00:26:12,788 --> 00:26:15,690
For the other districts, the racial makeup

475
00:26:15,690 --> 00:26:17,251
actually played a role in determining

476
00:26:17,251 --> 00:26:19,452
the percentage chance of racist lines playing.

477
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:24,342
So as the population of African American pedestrians increased,

478
00:26:24,342 --> 00:26:29,205
the odds of encountering someone who is racist decreased.

479
00:26:29,205 --> 00:26:31,707
We also identified pedestrians along other axes.

480
00:26:31,707 --> 00:26:36,870
In the game, there are 38 pedestrian archetypes.

481
00:26:36,870 --> 00:26:40,012
And we divided each of those along several lines.

482
00:26:40,012 --> 00:26:44,816
So there's income, which is low, middle, high, gender, race,

483
00:26:44,816 --> 00:26:46,977
and bias, which was our term for whether or not

484
00:26:46,977 --> 00:26:48,038
that character was racist.

485
00:26:49,040 --> 00:26:50,921
That information was then used to determine

486
00:26:50,921 --> 00:26:53,102
where those pedestrians would spawn in the world.

487
00:26:53,102 --> 00:26:56,184
So there's a section of the city called River Row,

488
00:26:56,184 --> 00:26:58,385
which is where Vito, the protagonist from Mafia II,

489
00:26:58,385 --> 00:26:59,565
that's where he's located.

490
00:26:59,565 --> 00:27:01,406
And that's a poorer part of town,

491
00:27:01,406 --> 00:27:03,487
so only low income with an occasional

492
00:27:03,487 --> 00:27:06,569
middle class pedestrian would spawn there.

493
00:27:06,569 --> 00:27:10,131
And based on the breakdown of specific pedestrians,

494
00:27:10,131 --> 00:27:13,753
we actually created writing guidelines and biographies

495
00:27:13,753 --> 00:27:16,574
for each of those 38 archetypes in the game,

496
00:27:16,574 --> 00:27:17,415
which we then used to...

497
00:27:18,605 --> 00:27:22,147
basically provide a kind of a launch pad for not only their

498
00:27:22,147 --> 00:27:24,629
systemic lines but also their conversations. And this is one

499
00:27:24,629 --> 00:27:31,514
of them. So this is actually what, basically what we wrote

500
00:27:31,514 --> 00:27:36,597
for all 38 of those. So in this case that archetype is named

501
00:27:36,597 --> 00:27:40,340
Saffron, she's racist, we explain why she's racist. And

502
00:27:40,340 --> 00:27:45,163
then there's Mirabel who's not racist and we also explain why

503
00:27:45,163 --> 00:27:47,225
she's not racist.

504
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:51,251
And I should note that all offensive lines in the game,

505
00:27:51,251 --> 00:27:53,092
racially insensitive lines, I should say,

506
00:27:53,092 --> 00:27:54,812
they're all on a universal timer.

507
00:27:54,812 --> 00:27:57,033
So if an enemy says something,

508
00:27:57,033 --> 00:28:00,815
it's then 10 minutes before any other character,

509
00:28:00,815 --> 00:28:04,817
a pedestrian, police officer, another enemy,

510
00:28:04,817 --> 00:28:09,359
says something that's racially insensitive to the player.

511
00:28:09,359 --> 00:28:11,520
So before I move on to the police,

512
00:28:12,335 --> 00:28:15,156
I'll talk a little bit about how we handled stores.

513
00:28:15,156 --> 00:28:17,377
Although segregation officially ended

514
00:28:17,377 --> 00:28:19,438
with the passage of the Civil Rights Act in 1964,

515
00:28:19,438 --> 00:28:21,638
it was still present in housing.

516
00:28:21,638 --> 00:28:26,480
Like I mentioned earlier, the Fair Housing Act

517
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:27,441
passed in April of 1968.

518
00:28:27,441 --> 00:28:30,582
And individual store owners still discriminated

519
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:31,562
against customers of color.

520
00:28:31,562 --> 00:28:36,104
So what we did is we created a mixture of essentially

521
00:28:36,104 --> 00:28:39,185
desegregated and segregated stores across the city.

522
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,966
And these are locations the player can enter.

523
00:28:42,989 --> 00:28:45,030
So in the case of a desegregated store,

524
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:49,271
when the player enters, the person who owns that store

525
00:28:49,271 --> 00:28:53,012
greets them, they're friendly, ask them how they're doing.

526
00:28:53,012 --> 00:28:56,574
When the player leaves, they tell them goodbye.

527
00:28:56,574 --> 00:28:58,434
In the case of a segregated store,

528
00:28:58,434 --> 00:28:59,595
they're immediately hostile.

529
00:28:59,595 --> 00:29:01,355
They ask you why you're there, they insult you,

530
00:29:01,355 --> 00:29:04,056
and they tell you that if you don't leave immediately,

531
00:29:04,056 --> 00:29:06,097
they're going to call the police.

532
00:29:06,097 --> 00:29:11,138
So this is a...

533
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:15,401
This loops back a little bit to the example

534
00:29:15,401 --> 00:29:18,484
of that Jim Brown quote, which was part of the

535
00:29:18,484 --> 00:29:22,667
kind of real life interviews that we read.

536
00:29:22,667 --> 00:29:24,848
So police in open world games generally act

537
00:29:24,848 --> 00:29:27,290
as a guard rail for the player's actions.

538
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:30,213
So they only respond when the player is openly hostile,

539
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:31,814
such as running over civilians,

540
00:29:31,814 --> 00:29:33,935
running around with your gun,

541
00:29:33,935 --> 00:29:35,837
or directly attacking the police themselves.

542
00:29:35,837 --> 00:29:37,318
And we wanted to keep that,

543
00:29:37,318 --> 00:29:40,200
but one of the things that kept coming up

544
00:29:40,823 --> 00:29:44,606
was how we could essentially allow the game systems

545
00:29:44,606 --> 00:29:48,150
to express what it'd be like to be Lincoln Clay

546
00:29:48,150 --> 00:29:49,531
in a southern city in 1968,

547
00:29:49,531 --> 00:29:54,035
specifically as how it relates to the police.

548
00:29:54,035 --> 00:29:56,397
And again, this was with an eye toward

549
00:29:56,397 --> 00:30:00,221
creating an authentic experience.

550
00:30:00,221 --> 00:30:03,664
So one of the big changes is that the police in our game

551
00:30:03,664 --> 00:30:04,625
are always watching you.

552
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:07,961
So what we decided to do was populate the world

553
00:30:07,961 --> 00:30:11,143
with persistent police, both on foot and in cars.

554
00:30:11,143 --> 00:30:13,024
And unlike police in other open world games,

555
00:30:13,024 --> 00:30:15,845
as soon as our police see the player,

556
00:30:15,845 --> 00:30:17,385
they become suspicious.

557
00:30:17,385 --> 00:30:19,326
And that's represented, if you can see it,

558
00:30:19,326 --> 00:30:20,667
there's actually blue icons on the map,

559
00:30:20,667 --> 00:30:24,569
and it shows you that a police officer's watching you

560
00:30:24,569 --> 00:30:26,469
in the direction that they're,

561
00:30:26,469 --> 00:30:27,910
where they are from you, direction-wise.

562
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:31,011
If you're on foot, I'm sorry,

563
00:30:31,011 --> 00:30:32,572
if the police officer is on foot,

564
00:30:33,173 --> 00:30:38,659
He will actually, we have systemic lines where that police officer will tell you that he's watching you.

565
00:30:38,659 --> 00:30:43,504
He might also warn you, tell you to move on and get out of there.

566
00:30:43,504 --> 00:30:50,531
If you commit a crime and a police officer sees you, they're immediately hostile and they open fire on the player.

567
00:30:50,531 --> 00:30:51,892
And much like the pedestrians...

568
00:30:52,765 --> 00:30:56,807
We controlled where the police spawned and increased or decreased the police presence

569
00:30:56,807 --> 00:31:00,488
in parts of town to make the world feel consistent.

570
00:31:00,488 --> 00:31:03,328
So Frisco Fields, which again is the rich white enclave,

571
00:31:03,328 --> 00:31:08,930
has the most persistent police, while Delray Hollow, which is where Lincoln's from, has none.

572
00:31:08,930 --> 00:31:14,112
And this was done, again, with an eye toward showing that, just as in real life in 1968,

573
00:31:14,112 --> 00:31:18,153
police prioritized certain sections of the city over others.

574
00:31:20,491 --> 00:31:23,952
The second part of how the police system works involves the police dispatcher.

575
00:31:23,952 --> 00:31:27,532
So if you're seen committing a crime by a pedestrian,

576
00:31:27,532 --> 00:31:30,273
they'll run to a pay phone and call the police.

577
00:31:30,273 --> 00:31:33,974
And this is universally applied across the city because nobody wants

578
00:31:33,974 --> 00:31:36,194
to be the victim of crime.

579
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:38,495
So they run and they call the police.

580
00:31:38,495 --> 00:31:43,295
What happens then though varies based on where you are in the city.

581
00:31:43,295 --> 00:31:45,516
So if you're in, again, Frisco Fields.

582
00:31:46,664 --> 00:31:49,706
the police dispatcher, which the player hears,

583
00:31:49,706 --> 00:31:52,628
will say, describe the crime that's happened,

584
00:31:52,628 --> 00:31:55,510
and basically say all units immediately converge,

585
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:57,452
and then the police are there right away.

586
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:01,838
If you're in the hollow, it's much more apathetic.

587
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:06,439
In fact, that's one of the, which I'll mention here in a second.

588
00:32:06,439 --> 00:32:09,440
It's much more apathetic in terms of the dispatcher's response.

589
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,020
They still describe the crime, but then they may say something like,

590
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:15,341
eh, if anybody's up to it, go check it out.

591
00:32:15,341 --> 00:32:17,421
And there's no urgency behind it at all.

592
00:32:17,421 --> 00:32:18,821
There's also a middle ground.

593
00:32:18,821 --> 00:32:25,323
So our three kind of stages for the dispatcher is apathetic, normal, and aggressive.

594
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:35,584
And as a part of this, the aggressive, normal, and apathetic,

595
00:32:35,584 --> 00:32:38,827
not only is that an audio clue to the player

596
00:32:38,827 --> 00:32:41,330
in terms of how the police is going to respond to them,

597
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,772
that actually dictates how the police respond to them in the game.

598
00:32:43,772 --> 00:32:48,156
So the police, again, where you are in the city determines the speed

599
00:32:48,156 --> 00:32:51,800
at which the police respond to the crime that you've committed,

600
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:53,341
with the hollow, again, being the slowest.

601
00:32:56,654 --> 00:32:58,134
So just like with the pedestrians,

602
00:32:58,134 --> 00:33:01,355
we have a lot of enemy conversations throughout the game,

603
00:33:01,355 --> 00:33:03,456
both within the missions and in racket locations.

604
00:33:03,456 --> 00:33:06,377
And again, they talk about a wide range of topics,

605
00:33:06,377 --> 00:33:08,337
but since we also wanted them to reflect

606
00:33:08,337 --> 00:33:09,517
on the player actions,

607
00:33:09,517 --> 00:33:11,558
there's also conversations about that.

608
00:33:11,558 --> 00:33:13,458
So there's a mob lieutenant in the game

609
00:33:13,458 --> 00:33:14,479
called Tony DeRozio,

610
00:33:14,479 --> 00:33:17,299
who you throw out of a high rise building.

611
00:33:17,299 --> 00:33:20,120
And so later on, you may hear enemies talking about it.

612
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,701
Hey, did you hear what happened to Tony?

613
00:33:21,701 --> 00:33:23,581
You know, we can't believe that happened.

614
00:33:23,581 --> 00:33:25,242
We need to get the guy who did it, things like that.

615
00:33:27,009 --> 00:33:32,594
And again, there's also era-specific conversations with them.

616
00:33:32,594 --> 00:33:35,136
So, where they discuss what's going on in Vietnam, you know,

617
00:33:35,136 --> 00:33:39,540
I think there's one conversation where one of them has a buddy who's a draft dodger, things like that.

618
00:33:39,540 --> 00:33:44,645
But the biggest challenge with the enemies was their bark,

619
00:33:44,645 --> 00:33:47,908
specifically how racist they could be to the player.

620
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:52,872
So the men you're fighting, we generalize obviously since they're the enemies.

621
00:33:53,408 --> 00:33:55,629
But by and large, they're racist southerners.

622
00:33:55,629 --> 00:33:58,451
So initially, we pushed that as far as we could,

623
00:33:58,451 --> 00:34:02,373
thinking that would make for a more authentic experience.

624
00:34:02,373 --> 00:34:05,255
This included enemies using the most racially charged language

625
00:34:05,255 --> 00:34:06,075
you can imagine.

626
00:34:06,075 --> 00:34:10,818
But as we started to focus test the game,

627
00:34:11,772 --> 00:34:18,140
We received pretty universal feedback that the barks felt gratuitous and that they were

628
00:34:18,140 --> 00:34:20,402
there simply for shock value.

629
00:34:20,402 --> 00:34:24,267
So obviously that's the exact opposite of what we wanted.

630
00:34:24,267 --> 00:34:30,193
So as we investigated the feedback, what we learned is that there needed to be context.

631
00:34:30,759 --> 00:34:34,943
So while an enemy yelling out racial insults might be authentic to that time and place,

632
00:34:34,943 --> 00:34:36,825
it didn't make for a good player experience.

633
00:34:36,825 --> 00:34:40,769
So because of that, we slowly removed the most egregious bark from the game

634
00:34:40,769 --> 00:34:45,134
until we had what we felt was a nice balance between authenticity and context.

635
00:34:47,250 --> 00:34:50,531
The enemies still spout out, they still yell harsh language.

636
00:34:50,531 --> 00:34:55,133
But like the pedestrians, how we had specific pedestrian archetypes,

637
00:34:55,133 --> 00:34:55,994
we limited that language to them.

638
00:34:55,994 --> 00:34:58,495
We did the same thing with the enemies.

639
00:34:58,495 --> 00:35:01,356
So two of our archetypes, the shotgunner and the enforcer,

640
00:35:01,356 --> 00:35:04,138
they were the only ones that would express any racist lines at all.

641
00:35:04,138 --> 00:35:09,300
With the exception of the Dixie Mafia, who is basically racist across the board.

642
00:35:11,358 --> 00:35:17,960
The big lesson for us was not to be afraid of pursuing something as sensitive as this,

643
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:24,103
but also trusting in our focus testing, both externally and internally, to help us essentially

644
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:29,685
kind of navigate through and make sure that we got it right.

645
00:35:30,361 --> 00:35:36,246
So the radio is a great tool because in open world games with driving, it's pretty much ever present.

646
00:35:36,246 --> 00:35:39,409
Every time you get in a car, it's pretty standard for the genre.

647
00:35:39,409 --> 00:35:43,432
There's a song playing or a news story, things like that.

648
00:35:43,432 --> 00:35:48,737
And we decided pretty early on that we wanted to lean on it and use it to help expand the narrative

649
00:35:48,737 --> 00:35:53,241
in the world beyond the usual confines of missions and open world activities.

650
00:35:54,115 --> 00:35:58,277
So the first two up there, Hollow Speaks and Native Son,

651
00:35:58,277 --> 00:36:00,818
those are actually two radio programs that we created.

652
00:36:00,818 --> 00:36:02,959
They each have about 12 to 15 episodes

653
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:05,800
and they're mapped out over the course of the game.

654
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:08,401
So again, we try to use them to reflect player actions

655
00:36:08,401 --> 00:36:10,142
and where they were within the story.

656
00:36:10,142 --> 00:36:12,983
The first, Hollow Speaks, is hosted by a man

657
00:36:12,983 --> 00:36:14,784
named Charles DeVoist-Laveau.

658
00:36:14,784 --> 00:36:17,685
And the second one, Native Son, is hosted by Remy Duvall,

659
00:36:17,685 --> 00:36:20,406
a rich white man, who also happens to head up

660
00:36:20,406 --> 00:36:22,527
the Southern Union, which is our version of the Klan.

661
00:36:23,781 --> 00:36:27,583
And our goal with those was to offer two very different viewpoints

662
00:36:27,583 --> 00:36:29,824
on what was happening not only in New Bordeaux

663
00:36:29,824 --> 00:36:31,024
but also the country in 1968.

664
00:36:31,024 --> 00:36:36,207
And then the last two points is something we call the trial,

665
00:36:36,207 --> 00:36:39,809
which I'll talk about, and then also how we use news, both real world

666
00:36:39,809 --> 00:36:42,150
and news that reflected player actions.

667
00:36:44,628 --> 00:36:47,909
So, HoloSpeaks, that's Charles Laveau, right there, the voice.

668
00:36:47,909 --> 00:36:50,390
He's actually one of the main characters in Faster Baby,

669
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:55,012
which is our DLC coming out in, I think, about a month.

670
00:36:55,012 --> 00:37:00,094
He was inspired by Malcolm X, specifically a speech he gave

671
00:37:00,094 --> 00:37:01,655
called The Ballad of the Bullet.

672
00:37:01,655 --> 00:37:03,375
And a man named Robert F. Williams,

673
00:37:03,375 --> 00:37:07,577
who was the pirate radio guy, who, if I remember right,

674
00:37:07,577 --> 00:37:10,718
he had a boat, and he basically just floated around offshore

675
00:37:10,718 --> 00:37:13,960
so nobody could get him, and had a pirate radio station.

676
00:37:15,035 --> 00:37:19,698
And it was called Radio Free Dixie.

677
00:37:19,698 --> 00:37:23,341
So in the case of Laveau, unlike Cassandra,

678
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:28,004
who tends to have a more local view of what's happening,

679
00:37:28,004 --> 00:37:30,966
Laveau views things on a much larger scale.

680
00:37:30,966 --> 00:37:32,307
He believes that what's going on needs

681
00:37:32,307 --> 00:37:33,868
to have national context, not just local context.

682
00:37:34,711 --> 00:37:38,753
And he agitates against the Vietnam War, drug policies,

683
00:37:38,753 --> 00:37:40,334
things of that nature.

684
00:37:40,334 --> 00:37:43,857
The other thing that he does is, although he's

685
00:37:43,857 --> 00:37:46,739
very much about African-American empowerment,

686
00:37:46,739 --> 00:37:50,401
he also understands that class defines

687
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:53,743
a lot of people and the buckets they fall into too,

688
00:37:53,743 --> 00:37:56,605
so specifically poor white Americans.

689
00:37:56,605 --> 00:37:59,607
So when he talks about Vietnam, his point

690
00:37:59,607 --> 00:38:01,608
is it's poor people going of any race.

691
00:38:01,608 --> 00:38:03,429
It's not just poor African-Americans who are going.

692
00:38:06,721 --> 00:38:09,883
So Native Son, that's Remy Duval there.

693
00:38:09,883 --> 00:38:13,304
He was inspired by William F. Buckley.

694
00:38:13,304 --> 00:38:17,786
He's a wealthy land developer, so he comes across as very genial.

695
00:38:17,786 --> 00:38:19,267
He's what I call a hey buddy.

696
00:38:19,267 --> 00:38:22,228
You know, he comes up to you and he's like, hey buddy.

697
00:38:22,228 --> 00:38:26,710
He believes in maintaining law and order, agitates against social change, and uses coded

698
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:30,512
language to advocate for the suppression of minority rights.

699
00:38:32,022 --> 00:38:37,683
Um, in both these cases, these, these, these two characters don't exist strictly in the

700
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:42,944
radio. Um, in the case of Laveau, he's actually, early on in the game, he's actually one of the

701
00:38:42,944 --> 00:38:47,625
first contacts you meet at the behest of Cassandra when you reclaim the hollow from the

702
00:38:47,625 --> 00:38:54,047
Dixie Mafia. Um, Remy is actually involved in Sal's plot to legalize gambling. He's actually

703
00:38:54,047 --> 00:38:54,807
the landowner.

704
00:38:55,518 --> 00:38:58,781
and developer of the casino being built.

705
00:38:58,781 --> 00:39:00,843
So initially they start off on the radio,

706
00:39:00,843 --> 00:39:06,008
but then later on they intersect with the main narrative.

707
00:39:06,008 --> 00:39:10,072
And confront Remy at a Southern Union rally.

708
00:39:10,072 --> 00:39:15,257
So the trial, we also wanted to use the radio

709
00:39:15,257 --> 00:39:20,382
to introduce kind of B and C narrative stories.

710
00:39:20,797 --> 00:39:23,378
And like I said before, this is what we call the trial.

711
00:39:23,378 --> 00:39:26,879
It starts off as something you hear on the radio

712
00:39:26,879 --> 00:39:29,120
about four or five hours in.

713
00:39:29,120 --> 00:39:32,201
And then again, just like Remy and The Voice,

714
00:39:32,201 --> 00:39:34,702
it intersects with the primary narrative path

715
00:39:34,702 --> 00:39:35,262
at a later point.

716
00:39:35,262 --> 00:39:38,603
And what happens here is two African American men,

717
00:39:38,603 --> 00:39:40,164
Trey McCall and Lamont Harris,

718
00:39:40,164 --> 00:39:43,085
they're actually driving through a section of the city

719
00:39:43,085 --> 00:39:45,726
called South Downs and their car breaks down.

720
00:39:45,726 --> 00:39:48,987
They go to a white homeowner's house to ask for help.

721
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,228
He comes out and shoots both of them.

722
00:39:51,253 --> 00:39:54,675
And over the course of Remy and The Voice and then also

723
00:39:54,675 --> 00:39:57,397
the in-game news discussing this, what he claims

724
00:39:57,397 --> 00:39:59,438
is that he's heard about Lincoln Clay

725
00:39:59,438 --> 00:40:01,880
and he thought these two men were Lincoln Clay,

726
00:40:01,880 --> 00:40:03,221
and that's why he did what he did.

727
00:40:03,221 --> 00:40:08,965
That case is being overseen by a man named Judge Holden.

728
00:40:08,965 --> 00:40:13,648
And at first, he's just part of that radio story.

729
00:40:13,648 --> 00:40:15,509
But then later on, what you find out,

730
00:40:15,509 --> 00:40:18,010
he's also part of Sal's casino plot.

731
00:40:18,010 --> 00:40:20,572
He's the judge who's going to rule and legalize gambling.

732
00:40:21,215 --> 00:40:22,837
So at a certain point, when you're

733
00:40:22,837 --> 00:40:25,959
going after Uncle Lou who runs the French ward,

734
00:40:25,959 --> 00:40:28,882
there's a mission where you actually directly confront

735
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:29,262
the judge.

736
00:40:29,262 --> 00:40:36,768
And again, this was another way of, again,

737
00:40:36,768 --> 00:40:39,030
it's all about that time and place

738
00:40:39,030 --> 00:40:42,112
and trying to show how hard it is for certain people,

739
00:40:42,112 --> 00:40:44,734
specifically people of color, to get justice.

740
00:40:44,734 --> 00:40:48,117
So it was another way to reinforce

741
00:40:48,117 --> 00:40:49,238
that specific time and place.

742
00:40:51,406 --> 00:40:55,828
And finally, the news, which unfortunately I don't have a slide for.

743
00:40:55,828 --> 00:41:01,111
But we wrote over 100 news stories, and those reflect the actual events of 1968.

744
00:41:01,111 --> 00:41:03,172
And that's a wide array of topics.

745
00:41:03,172 --> 00:41:07,294
It's everything from what was happening in Vietnam, you know, escalation,

746
00:41:07,294 --> 00:41:10,836
major battles, things like that, to Vince Lombardi retiring.

747
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:16,119
And we also included around 40 stories that comment on what the player's doing.

748
00:41:16,119 --> 00:41:20,821
And we did this to give the player a sense of agency, that the world was...

749
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:26,421
understanding what they did, that the world was acknowledging it.

750
00:41:26,421 --> 00:41:32,142
And again, our hope, just like the documentary segments, we were hoping that this intersection

751
00:41:32,142 --> 00:41:37,324
of real news and in-game news would help ground the experience and create the sense that this

752
00:41:37,324 --> 00:41:42,545
is a real time and place in American history and wasn't something completely created by

753
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:47,166
scratch by us.

754
00:41:48,827 --> 00:41:51,469
So in conclusion, my primary goal with this talk

755
00:41:51,469 --> 00:41:53,711
was to encourage other developers and publishers

756
00:41:53,711 --> 00:41:55,993
to take risks and not shy away from sensitive

757
00:41:55,993 --> 00:41:57,013
or controversial topics.

758
00:41:57,013 --> 00:41:59,615
And I'm not gonna lie to you,

759
00:41:59,615 --> 00:42:01,137
working on this game was very hard.

760
00:42:03,007 --> 00:42:06,688
We had a lot of very uncomfortable conversations about race,

761
00:42:06,688 --> 00:42:09,129
about language, about our country,

762
00:42:09,129 --> 00:42:11,490
about our country's history,

763
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:14,151
about how the world views Lincoln Clay,

764
00:42:14,151 --> 00:42:14,951
just to name a few.

765
00:42:14,951 --> 00:42:18,593
And strictly on the right,

766
00:42:18,593 --> 00:42:20,794
sometimes it was very difficult to give voice

767
00:42:20,794 --> 00:42:23,475
to some of the most reprehensible characters

768
00:42:23,475 --> 00:42:25,716
you can imagine, like Remy Duvall,

769
00:42:25,716 --> 00:42:27,556
who's essentially the head of the Klan.

770
00:42:27,556 --> 00:42:31,078
We have another character in the game named Santangelo,

771
00:42:31,078 --> 00:42:32,578
who is just a vile human being.

772
00:42:33,126 --> 00:42:35,828
But again, we felt like we had to include them

773
00:42:35,828 --> 00:42:38,650
because they provided that context

774
00:42:38,650 --> 00:42:43,013
and helped reinforce the time and place.

775
00:42:43,013 --> 00:42:45,555
In the end, obviously everyone at Hangar 13 and 2K

776
00:42:45,555 --> 00:42:47,056
believes it was worth the risk.

777
00:42:47,056 --> 00:42:50,039
We think we created a game

778
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,360
that resonated with a lot of people.

779
00:42:52,360 --> 00:42:55,623
And even now, I think it's five months since release,

780
00:42:55,623 --> 00:42:56,563
there's still a lot of people,

781
00:42:56,563 --> 00:42:58,945
it's obvious it resonated with people

782
00:42:58,945 --> 00:43:01,147
because people are still talking about it.

783
00:43:01,147 --> 00:43:02,508
NPR did a story on the game.

784
00:43:03,115 --> 00:43:07,820
The New York Times actually last weekend ran a story about the game.

785
00:43:07,820 --> 00:43:12,465
And it's easily been the most rewarding part of my career doing video games.

786
00:43:12,465 --> 00:43:18,972
And that's it. So thank you very much. If anyone has any questions, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

787
00:43:28,799 --> 00:43:32,301
the aisles if anybody wants to get up and ask a few questions or if they'd rather do

788
00:43:32,301 --> 00:43:34,443
it in the comfort of their own home, that's fine too.

789
00:43:34,443 --> 00:43:36,464
Sure, whichever people prefer.

790
00:43:36,464 --> 00:43:38,666
Anybody?

791
00:43:38,666 --> 00:43:45,310
No takers?

792
00:43:47,897 --> 00:43:49,799
Hi, I guess I'll go.

793
00:43:49,799 --> 00:43:53,083
You talked a lot about how you created the world

794
00:43:53,083 --> 00:43:55,025
and the people within it,

795
00:43:55,025 --> 00:43:59,350
making sure it was very much all cohesive

796
00:43:59,350 --> 00:44:00,071
in a time and place.

797
00:44:00,071 --> 00:44:03,615
But one thing that really impressed me when I played it

798
00:44:03,615 --> 00:44:05,016
was that the,

799
00:44:06,618 --> 00:44:10,359
his extended family, his adoptive father and brother,

800
00:44:10,359 --> 00:44:11,519
and all those core characters,

801
00:44:11,519 --> 00:44:14,720
and the first several hours of the game

802
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,481
was getting to know them before all hell breaks loose.

803
00:44:17,481 --> 00:44:20,602
And I felt really connected to those characters,

804
00:44:20,602 --> 00:44:22,022
and I really liked them.

805
00:44:22,022 --> 00:44:24,723
I'm curious about, you talked a lot about

806
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:26,484
creating the world and the time and place.

807
00:44:26,484 --> 00:44:28,184
What was your process when it came to

808
00:44:28,184 --> 00:44:30,365
actually creating the characters themselves,

809
00:44:30,365 --> 00:44:34,366
and how you made that connection from the beginning?

810
00:44:35,147 --> 00:44:39,008
Yeah, so in regards to creating the, specifically,

811
00:44:39,008 --> 00:44:41,049
I think you're speaking to Sammy and Ellis,

812
00:44:41,049 --> 00:44:43,550
and by extension, I include Danny in that as well.

813
00:44:43,550 --> 00:44:49,192
A game, at its core, Lincoln, like I said,

814
00:44:49,192 --> 00:44:51,513
at its core, Mafia III is a revenge story.

815
00:44:51,513 --> 00:44:54,794
So in order for that revenge to mean anything,

816
00:44:54,794 --> 00:44:56,814
we have to feel the same loss that Lincoln felt,

817
00:44:56,814 --> 00:44:57,695
as much as possible.

818
00:44:57,695 --> 00:45:00,275
So we spent a lot of time and effort to make,

819
00:45:00,275 --> 00:45:03,537
you can't, let me rephrase that, you can't make,

820
00:45:04,632 --> 00:45:08,998
the player hates someone, but maybe you can make the player love someone.

821
00:45:08,998 --> 00:45:13,484
And if you take the people that they love out, then hopefully they feel the same loss

822
00:45:13,484 --> 00:45:14,025
that Lincoln felt.

823
00:45:14,025 --> 00:45:18,971
So, like you said, we spent a lot of time on, we call that section of the game Act One,

824
00:45:18,971 --> 00:45:21,475
and we spent a lot of time.

825
00:45:22,543 --> 00:45:26,345
doing it and I don't know how many times we actually redid that, maybe five, six times,

826
00:45:26,345 --> 00:45:30,408
like completely over and restructuring things and moving things around.

827
00:45:30,408 --> 00:45:34,130
And to a large extent it was done with that eye to ensure that when

828
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:39,394
what happens in the bar happens that the player feels at least some degree of

829
00:45:39,394 --> 00:45:40,995
loss just as much as Lincoln does.

830
00:45:40,995 --> 00:45:41,355
It worked.

831
00:45:41,355 --> 00:45:41,595
Thank you.

832
00:45:44,864 --> 00:45:45,365
Excuse me, hi.

833
00:45:45,365 --> 00:45:46,926
I just wanted to say, first of all,

834
00:45:46,926 --> 00:45:48,907
I appreciate your work on Mafia III very much.

835
00:45:48,907 --> 00:45:50,669
And I just wanted to ask specifically,

836
00:45:50,669 --> 00:45:54,692
what was the cultural makeup of some of the writing teams

837
00:45:54,692 --> 00:45:58,435
that you worked with as lead narrative director?

838
00:45:58,435 --> 00:46:00,116
So we don't, it's 2K policy

839
00:46:00,116 --> 00:46:01,277
not to really go into that stuff.

840
00:46:01,277 --> 00:46:03,299
However, those of you, I mean,

841
00:46:03,299 --> 00:46:04,620
there's three of us who are full-time.

842
00:46:04,620 --> 00:46:05,441
We're all on Twitter.

843
00:46:05,441 --> 00:46:08,023
It's me, a man named Ed Fowler,

844
00:46:08,023 --> 00:46:11,426
and another game named Charles Webb,

845
00:46:11,426 --> 00:46:13,047
who some of you may follow.

846
00:46:13,047 --> 00:46:14,188
Charles is African-American.

847
00:46:15,463 --> 00:46:21,105
So it was very important to us to make sure that we actually had voices to speak to that community.

848
00:46:21,105 --> 00:46:24,047
And that extended beyond the writing too.

849
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:26,948
Obviously we have a very large African American cast.

850
00:46:26,948 --> 00:46:31,369
And when we did the cinematics, for example, we would sit down and talk to them.

851
00:46:32,031 --> 00:46:33,391
hey, does this feel natural?

852
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,932
Does this feel right to you in terms of your experience

853
00:46:35,932 --> 00:46:37,213
as an American?

854
00:46:37,213 --> 00:46:38,733
Is there anything that feels off?

855
00:46:38,733 --> 00:46:40,294
Is there anything that you want to express?

856
00:46:40,294 --> 00:46:43,195
For example, Gordon Green, who's the actor who

857
00:46:43,195 --> 00:46:44,836
played Father James, I can't tell you

858
00:46:44,836 --> 00:46:47,877
how many conversations he and I had about Father James's

859
00:46:47,877 --> 00:46:50,798
sections, specifically the documentary things.

860
00:46:50,798 --> 00:46:54,019
We spent one time in a conference room hours

861
00:46:54,019 --> 00:46:56,480
going through his script and just discussing things.

862
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:59,021
So it was very, very important to us, again,

863
00:46:59,021 --> 00:47:00,882
to make sure that we got that right.

864
00:47:00,882 --> 00:47:01,462
Absolutely.

865
00:47:01,728 --> 00:47:03,129
Thank you, admire your work very much.

866
00:47:03,129 --> 00:47:04,309
Thank you.

867
00:47:04,309 --> 00:47:09,352
So my question is really more about like characters.

868
00:47:09,352 --> 00:47:11,834
As you're building a character

869
00:47:11,834 --> 00:47:16,116
and you're planning on them not being involved very much

870
00:47:16,116 --> 00:47:19,718
and then you end up falling in love with that character,

871
00:47:19,718 --> 00:47:22,480
how difficult is it to kind of tie them back

872
00:47:22,480 --> 00:47:25,642
into the storyline?

873
00:47:25,642 --> 00:47:26,863
It's hard.

874
00:47:26,863 --> 00:47:29,664
I mean, we didn't have that problem.

875
00:47:29,664 --> 00:47:30,325
Let me rephrase that.

876
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:34,084
that problem wasn't exclusive to the allied characters.

877
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,347
So for example, a lot of people,

878
00:47:36,347 --> 00:47:38,189
the guy I mentioned before, Tony D'Orazio,

879
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:40,372
who you chuck out of a 28 story window,

880
00:47:40,372 --> 00:47:42,815
like a lot of people on the team loved him.

881
00:47:42,815 --> 00:47:44,618
Yeah, that's actually who I was kind of.

882
00:47:44,618 --> 00:47:45,539
He's a total weirdo.

883
00:47:47,384 --> 00:47:49,267
And so we had conversations like,

884
00:47:49,267 --> 00:47:51,150
hey, can you go on a mission with him early on?

885
00:47:51,150 --> 00:47:54,115
Like, how can we expose him to the player

886
00:47:54,115 --> 00:47:55,036
in additional ways?

887
00:47:55,036 --> 00:47:57,200
In the end, what we decided was

888
00:47:57,200 --> 00:47:59,003
we just have to hold to the story.

889
00:47:59,003 --> 00:47:59,283
Okay.

890
00:47:59,283 --> 00:48:01,266
And that it'd be better to leave.

891
00:48:01,927 --> 00:48:04,688
Better is not maybe the right word, but acceptable, I guess.

892
00:48:04,688 --> 00:48:06,589
To leave the player wanting more and saying,

893
00:48:06,589 --> 00:48:08,570
hey, you know what, that was a really cool character.

894
00:48:08,570 --> 00:48:10,351
I wish I could have spent more time with them,

895
00:48:10,351 --> 00:48:11,731
but feeling satisfied.

896
00:48:11,731 --> 00:48:13,252
Then it would be to go the other way

897
00:48:13,252 --> 00:48:16,133
and just kind of jam them into narrative places

898
00:48:16,133 --> 00:48:17,534
that they don't necessarily belong.

899
00:48:17,534 --> 00:48:20,615
And maybe let them overstay their welcome a little bit.

900
00:48:20,615 --> 00:48:21,015
Okay.

901
00:48:21,015 --> 00:48:21,355
Thank you.

902
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:21,675
Thanks.

903
00:48:22,492 --> 00:48:25,594
Hi, first of all, thank you so much for giving this talk.

904
00:48:25,594 --> 00:48:25,774
Sure.

905
00:48:25,774 --> 00:48:27,175
And I wanted to ask you,

906
00:48:27,175 --> 00:48:31,457
you spoke a lot about the research you did

907
00:48:31,457 --> 00:48:33,138
to make this game, and I wanted to ask you

908
00:48:33,138 --> 00:48:36,200
how long of your production was spent

909
00:48:36,200 --> 00:48:39,322
doing research and conceptualization?

910
00:48:39,322 --> 00:48:40,423
To be honest, it never stopped.

911
00:48:40,423 --> 00:48:40,543
Okay.

912
00:48:40,543 --> 00:48:43,865
As long as we were writing, we were still researching.

913
00:48:43,865 --> 00:48:44,026
Okay.

914
00:48:44,026 --> 00:48:44,826
I forgot to mention, and it wasn't,

915
00:48:44,826 --> 00:48:48,088
even though the, like the documentaries,

916
00:48:48,088 --> 00:48:51,871
the books, and the things like that,

917
00:48:51,871 --> 00:48:52,371
even though.

918
00:48:53,339 --> 00:48:55,280
The narrative team, we digested all that.

919
00:48:55,280 --> 00:48:58,201
We also exposed it to the team at large.

920
00:48:58,201 --> 00:49:01,563
We actually have a theater at work.

921
00:49:01,563 --> 00:49:04,304
And on Wednesdays, we would actually show documentaries and

922
00:49:04,304 --> 00:49:05,445
movies to the entire team.

923
00:49:05,445 --> 00:49:09,407
So that everyone within the team understood the kind of historical

924
00:49:09,407 --> 00:49:10,827
context that we were going for.

925
00:49:10,827 --> 00:49:14,529
But like I said, it never stopped, literally up until

926
00:49:14,529 --> 00:49:17,230
we hit our localization deadline and we had to stop.

927
00:49:17,550 --> 00:49:21,572
Okay. Did you designate a conceptualization phase before starting pre-production or production?

928
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:22,393
I'm sorry, I can't hear you.

929
00:49:22,393 --> 00:49:26,695
Sorry. Did you set aside at the beginning, before pre-production and conceptualization research?

930
00:49:26,695 --> 00:49:32,258
Yeah, I mean, we tried to follow the kind of normal development cycle in terms of,

931
00:49:32,258 --> 00:49:37,360
like, so I mentioned we had this giant Excel spreadsheet that was part of pre-production,

932
00:49:37,360 --> 00:49:40,502
and it was just to kind of give us a grasp of the breadth.

933
00:49:40,962 --> 00:49:42,744
of what was happening historically.

934
00:49:42,744 --> 00:49:45,988
And then it was a matter of just taking that

935
00:49:45,988 --> 00:49:47,770
and parsing it out across to the story.

936
00:49:47,770 --> 00:49:49,672
But like I said, I mean, you know,

937
00:49:49,672 --> 00:49:51,514
we'd be halfway done writing the cinematics

938
00:49:51,514 --> 00:49:53,776
and either Ed or Charles or someone would find something

939
00:49:53,776 --> 00:49:55,278
and say, hey, this is really interesting.

940
00:49:55,278 --> 00:49:56,279
We didn't know about this.

941
00:49:56,279 --> 00:49:57,620
Is there a way we can incorporate it?

942
00:49:58,385 --> 00:49:59,545
And we try to do that a lot.

943
00:49:59,545 --> 00:50:01,365
We call them persistent character conversations.

944
00:50:01,365 --> 00:50:04,686
So there's these three characters

945
00:50:04,686 --> 00:50:07,347
who actually work for the bosses that you recruit.

946
00:50:07,347 --> 00:50:09,787
They're Alma, Emmanuel, and Nikki.

947
00:50:09,787 --> 00:50:11,488
And we try to use them as a way

948
00:50:11,488 --> 00:50:14,829
to further expose those historical elements.

949
00:50:14,829 --> 00:50:17,349
So like Emmanuel, who I mentioned, he's Haitian,

950
00:50:17,349 --> 00:50:19,370
and he escapes from Papadak-du-Valais.

951
00:50:19,370 --> 00:50:21,150
That actually came about pretty late.

952
00:50:21,150 --> 00:50:23,291
Originally his scripts were written completely different.

953
00:50:23,291 --> 00:50:26,291
And then Ed kind of settled on that,

954
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,232
started going down that.

955
00:50:27,822 --> 00:50:30,203
historical well, so to speak, and we're like,

956
00:50:30,203 --> 00:50:31,604
hey, this is super interesting,

957
00:50:31,604 --> 00:50:33,365
it helps further define who he is as a character,

958
00:50:33,365 --> 00:50:34,726
so we incorporated it.

959
00:50:34,726 --> 00:50:35,286
Thank you.

960
00:50:35,286 --> 00:50:36,086
Thank you.

961
00:50:36,086 --> 00:50:40,489
I wanted to ask about the fictional city in New Bordeaux

962
00:50:40,489 --> 00:50:41,689
and the real city in New Orleans

963
00:50:41,689 --> 00:50:45,731
and sort of how you made New Bordeaux be its own thing

964
00:50:45,731 --> 00:50:48,513
and where you sort of drew those lines and why.

965
00:50:50,424 --> 00:50:54,467
So the short answer is that most of the accommodation

966
00:50:54,467 --> 00:50:57,089
we made in terms of shaping New Bordeaux

967
00:50:57,089 --> 00:50:58,430
was related around gameplay.

968
00:50:58,935 --> 00:51:00,136
So if you've been in New Orleans,

969
00:51:00,136 --> 00:51:03,219
the streets are pretty narrow, it's very flat.

970
00:51:03,219 --> 00:51:05,181
I mean it is, that place is flat.

971
00:51:05,181 --> 00:51:08,464
I mean, so driving, you know, the other part of the area

972
00:51:08,464 --> 00:51:09,925
is driving these awesome muscle cars.

973
00:51:09,925 --> 00:51:12,668
So driving a muscle car down flat roads

974
00:51:12,668 --> 00:51:15,010
in the very narrow streets wouldn't be that fun.

975
00:51:15,010 --> 00:51:18,233
So that was part of it, we widened the roads

976
00:51:18,233 --> 00:51:19,074
to accommodate that.

977
00:51:19,074 --> 00:51:20,835
The other thing we also did is we added

978
00:51:20,835 --> 00:51:23,118
a subterranean level to the city.

979
00:51:23,118 --> 00:51:25,360
So there's actually canals, obviously.

980
00:51:26,351 --> 00:51:27,792
New Orleans is below sea level.

981
00:51:27,792 --> 00:51:29,532
I think the water table's like five feet down

982
00:51:29,532 --> 00:51:30,533
or something like that.

983
00:51:30,533 --> 00:51:31,833
So that's physically impossible.

984
00:51:31,833 --> 00:51:33,774
But again, it was in search of some cool gameplay.

985
00:51:33,774 --> 00:51:37,295
And like I said, we just used New Orleans

986
00:51:37,295 --> 00:51:41,137
as our inspiration and then kind of did what we did

987
00:51:41,137 --> 00:51:42,498
as we created New Bordeaux,

988
00:51:42,498 --> 00:51:44,178
just to kind of shape it to fit our story,

989
00:51:44,178 --> 00:51:45,199
but then also fit our game world

990
00:51:45,199 --> 00:51:48,200
and what we wanted to accommodate in terms of gameplay.

991
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:49,220
Thank you.

992
00:51:49,220 --> 00:51:49,761
Thanks.

993
00:51:49,761 --> 00:51:53,642
I think we're out of time.

994
00:51:55,592 --> 00:52:06,961
If anyone has questions they want to ask Bill, he can go to the wrap-up room for a few minutes, which is the pen, as was talked about earlier, over there across the hall.

995
00:52:06,961 --> 00:52:13,365
Poster sessions, the students will be out there with their posters.

996
00:52:13,365 --> 00:52:18,229
The New Writers Q&A starts here in about five minutes, so feel free to go grab lunch and bring it in.
