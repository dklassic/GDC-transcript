1
00:00:03,034 --> 00:00:06,477
So, my name is Dave Weinstein, with me is Angela Gunn.

2
00:00:07,838 --> 00:00:10,380
And we're going to talk about what to do in the event of a security issue.

3
00:00:11,001 --> 00:00:14,524
Now, my background is in development and security, including services at scale,

4
00:00:14,564 --> 00:00:17,066
and I'll be talking to you about operational roles and planning.

5
00:00:17,867 --> 00:00:20,008
Angela's background is in journalism and communications,

6
00:00:20,189 --> 00:00:22,571
and she'll be talking to you about crisis communications,

7
00:00:23,171 --> 00:00:27,314
which are not quite the same thing as marketing, PR, or community management,

8
00:00:27,375 --> 00:00:28,756
but overlap all of them.

9
00:00:31,038 --> 00:00:31,238
All right.

10
00:00:31,875 --> 00:00:34,916
Bluntly, this is a talk about operational and communications

11
00:00:35,016 --> 00:00:36,457
planning and emergency response.

12
00:00:37,017 --> 00:00:39,259
This is not a technical talk, and we're not

13
00:00:39,299 --> 00:00:41,660
going to talk to you about how to do security right.

14
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,361
We are, in fact, just assuming that you

15
00:00:44,401 --> 00:00:45,782
are doing security right.

16
00:00:47,103 --> 00:00:49,504
Please be doing security right.

17
00:00:51,805 --> 00:00:53,426
So our intent in this talk is to give you

18
00:00:53,506 --> 00:00:54,827
tools you can put into action.

19
00:00:54,847 --> 00:00:56,928
You should be able to apply these techniques immediately

20
00:00:57,228 --> 00:00:59,469
and with the resources you already have on your team.

21
00:01:00,339 --> 00:01:02,140
I'm going to talk about logical roles in this.

22
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,422
In many cases, especially for small shops,

23
00:01:04,922 --> 00:01:06,463
people will wear multiple hats.

24
00:01:06,783 --> 00:01:08,405
We're going to talk about planning and training,

25
00:01:08,825 --> 00:01:10,746
including how to build playbooks for incident response,

26
00:01:10,906 --> 00:01:13,288
and how to use those even before an incident occurs

27
00:01:13,689 --> 00:01:16,110
to help identify critical paths and resource issues.

28
00:01:16,871 --> 00:01:18,712
Angela will talk to you about the security community, which

29
00:01:18,732 --> 00:01:20,754
you're probably not in touch with,

30
00:01:21,394 --> 00:01:23,296
and crisis communications and outreach.

31
00:01:24,657 --> 00:01:26,238
Now, there is an important thing.

32
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:30,001
I am not your lawyer.

33
00:01:31,173 --> 00:01:34,196
In fact, if you want to get right down to it, I'm not actually a lawyer.

34
00:01:35,817 --> 00:01:38,759
And if you really want to get technical, I don't have a degree.

35
00:01:41,081 --> 00:01:43,543
So Angela has a degree, that's the good news.

36
00:01:43,663 --> 00:01:48,267
The bad news is it's in philosophy, so totally do not get Socrates as your defense attorney.

37
00:01:49,768 --> 00:01:53,271
And neither one of us stayed at Holiday Inn Express last night, so you are totally 0 for 4.

38
00:01:54,552 --> 00:01:58,335
Now, unless you happen to have a lawyer turned game developer on your team, the odds are

39
00:01:58,355 --> 00:02:00,616
very good you don't have an in-house counsel.

40
00:02:01,707 --> 00:02:05,716
And that's fine. Whenever I talk about legal roles in the scope of this, what I'm really

41
00:02:05,756 --> 00:02:08,261
talking about is a person who's wearing that as an additional hat.

42
00:02:09,461 --> 00:02:13,385
This is someone on the team who's familiar with your contractual and other legal obligations.

43
00:02:14,006 --> 00:02:18,331
These may be the terms you have with a credit card company about protecting card information in PII.

44
00:02:18,991 --> 00:02:22,435
It may be a relationship you have with your sales channel and distribution channel,

45
00:02:22,835 --> 00:02:25,017
or with an IP holder whose work you've licensed.

46
00:02:25,838 --> 00:02:28,681
And in the case of things like the Children, Online, Privacy, and Protection Act,

47
00:02:29,222 --> 00:02:31,845
actual legal requirements imposed by the government by statute.

48
00:02:32,990 --> 00:02:36,112
That being said, when you're working on playbooks that involve legal issues,

49
00:02:36,532 --> 00:02:40,174
you probably do want to consult with an actual attorney brand attorney.

50
00:02:43,857 --> 00:02:47,179
What we're gonna do is we're gonna take a look at the operational roles that the

51
00:02:47,219 --> 00:02:47,879
model uses.

52
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,402
Many people will fall into more than one logical role, especially in smaller

53
00:02:52,442 --> 00:02:52,823
companies,

54
00:02:53,023 --> 00:02:53,823
and that's expected.

55
00:02:55,075 --> 00:02:58,216
One of the things that happens in any small company is people wear multiple hats.

56
00:02:58,236 --> 00:03:00,877
You usually find that out when they go somewhere else and you discover

57
00:03:00,897 --> 00:03:03,458
that you actually needed two or three people to do the work they were doing.

58
00:03:05,538 --> 00:03:09,439
To make this work, we're going to go over a set of terms and roles and other things

59
00:03:09,459 --> 00:03:11,580
that will help frame the discussion.

60
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:16,642
The first one is the notion of a DRI or directly responsible individual.

61
00:03:17,948 --> 00:03:20,228
And the DRI model is a little different than what you're used to.

62
00:03:20,308 --> 00:03:24,830
On most teams, either the producer or the lead programmer will make a decision about

63
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:30,031
whether or not an update goes live, whether something makes it into the build, whether

64
00:03:30,051 --> 00:03:31,671
the build is safe to prop to beta.

65
00:03:31,791 --> 00:03:34,412
All these decisions in a DRI model are made by the DRI.

66
00:03:35,052 --> 00:03:37,253
This person calls the shot usually a week at a time.

67
00:03:37,873 --> 00:03:43,198
So if you are the DRI, you are the one wearing the beeper, you are the one on call if something goes wrong at 4 in the morning,

68
00:03:43,499 --> 00:03:49,865
and you are the one who says, wow, this is really, really buggy, I don't think we want to push it to beta or even to internal testing or friendly testers.

69
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,101
The DRI does not need to be a programmer.

70
00:03:54,681 --> 00:03:56,902
Any member of the team should be able to fulfill this role.

71
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,124
After all, we're historically used to having producers

72
00:04:00,224 --> 00:04:02,326
fulfill a lot of this role, and most of them

73
00:04:02,366 --> 00:04:03,166
are not programmers.

74
00:04:04,267 --> 00:04:05,608
And the ones that were programmers

75
00:04:05,668 --> 00:04:07,149
haven't been programmers, as a general rule,

76
00:04:07,209 --> 00:04:09,530
for long enough that their skills are rusted out anyway

77
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:10,350
as far as that goes.

78
00:04:10,390 --> 00:04:12,292
You don't need to be technical for this role.

79
00:04:12,712 --> 00:04:14,313
It's a matter of training and responsibility.

80
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,374
And that's something that we're going to talk about throughout this discussion

81
00:04:17,895 --> 00:04:21,077
is that it's really important if you're going to put people in a position to make

82
00:04:21,117 --> 00:04:24,378
decisions that have real impact to train them and not just put them out there to

83
00:04:24,438 --> 00:04:24,699
fail.

84
00:04:25,719 --> 00:04:28,241
The DRI does not make decisions in a vacuum.

85
00:04:28,761 --> 00:04:31,663
Decisions about the status of bills are going to be taken after discussion with

86
00:04:31,703 --> 00:04:32,143
the leads.

87
00:04:33,003 --> 00:04:36,966
The DRI is responsible for the decisions they make but you need to support them.

88
00:04:37,346 --> 00:04:38,646
Don't hang your people out to dry.

89
00:04:39,873 --> 00:04:41,815
and you want the DRI role to rotate.

90
00:04:42,135 --> 00:04:45,700
It's stressful and you need anyone to be able to act in that role as needed.

91
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,525
Otherwise, you can't take a vacation, go to a wedding, get married,

92
00:04:50,545 --> 00:04:54,009
have any kind of a life if you are always the person who has to be there.

93
00:04:54,069 --> 00:04:56,612
And again, we're going to see that more when we look at critical paths.

94
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,231
Finally, you probably want to have an internal only email

95
00:05:01,271 --> 00:05:03,652
address that's just DRI that can be reached

96
00:05:03,672 --> 00:05:04,733
by anyone on your team.

97
00:05:05,293 --> 00:05:07,454
And then you don't have to worry about who is DRI this week.

98
00:05:07,494 --> 00:05:08,495
If something comes up, you send it

99
00:05:08,535 --> 00:05:10,676
to DRI at your domain any time.

100
00:05:13,257 --> 00:05:15,658
Now, we're going to talk a lot about communications

101
00:05:15,698 --> 00:05:17,659
in this role, internally and externally, or more

102
00:05:17,699 --> 00:05:19,940
specifically, Angela is going to talk a lot about this role.

103
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:24,062
Now, assuming you're large enough to actually have a comms team,

104
00:05:24,602 --> 00:05:27,984
what this means is your technical staff don't actually have to learn to speak to

105
00:05:28,004 --> 00:05:29,385
the outside world if they don't want to.

106
00:05:29,965 --> 00:05:34,348
Some of them will. Generally speaking, because of the demographics of the industry,

107
00:05:34,428 --> 00:05:37,469
most of them are introverted and really don't want to talk to other human beings

108
00:05:37,569 --> 00:05:38,590
if they can possibly help it.

109
00:05:39,498 --> 00:05:42,860
Now for smaller teams and certainly for single-person shops this doesn't apply.

110
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:44,541
You'll be wearing this hat among many others.

111
00:05:45,202 --> 00:05:51,645
But the whole idea is again, we're trying to give people responsibilities that they are comfortable with and trained for.

112
00:05:52,446 --> 00:05:54,467
And so you'll find people who are like,

113
00:05:54,547 --> 00:05:57,529
I'm perfectly fine with making decisions about whether or not the build goes out,

114
00:05:57,909 --> 00:06:01,291
but I don't want to be the one to talk to the player base and tell them there's no update this week.

115
00:06:02,304 --> 00:06:05,225
And you'll have other people who don't want to make the decision but are fine putting

116
00:06:05,265 --> 00:06:08,967
things into terms that the players or the press or anyone else can understand.

117
00:06:10,188 --> 00:06:13,569
And in fact, comms, in addition to keeping the DRI in the loop of anything they find,

118
00:06:13,629 --> 00:06:18,171
comms will often be the transition point between multiple DRIs if it's rolling off at the end

119
00:06:18,191 --> 00:06:21,893
of the week saying, hey, this is what we were working on last week, just so you know.

120
00:06:22,794 --> 00:06:25,515
In a smaller shop, you'll probably know anyway.

121
00:06:28,996 --> 00:06:29,677
General staff.

122
00:06:30,417 --> 00:06:31,538
This is everybody else.

123
00:06:32,557 --> 00:06:36,258
Now, there's an old folk expression, you have two ears and one mouth for a reason.

124
00:06:37,879 --> 00:06:41,341
I've not personally done well with that advice, but it's there.

125
00:06:42,301 --> 00:06:46,283
The key point is that you want to have a way for your team members to be ears for the company,

126
00:06:46,683 --> 00:06:50,665
and you don't want to have them speaking for the company accidentally.

127
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:54,587
If you're speaking as a representative of the company, it should be something planned

128
00:06:54,627 --> 00:06:55,147
and deliberate.

129
00:06:57,259 --> 00:07:02,544
Now, there are a couple ways to do this. The biggest one is to have an internal only email address, essentially fire.

130
00:07:03,345 --> 00:07:07,489
Or, fire's a good one. Basically, something has gone wrong.

131
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:13,055
And this something doesn't have to be technical. It can be, hey, there's a report of a bug on the internet, are we vulnerable?

132
00:07:13,495 --> 00:07:15,777
It can be, hey, someone is pirating our game.

133
00:07:16,198 --> 00:07:20,763
It can be, hey, someone got upset about a design decision we made and Reddit is exploding.

134
00:07:22,179 --> 00:07:26,542
It's just a way for people on your team who happen to be out looking at something on Twitter

135
00:07:26,662 --> 00:07:30,505
or Reddit or anywhere else to go, oh, they're talking about us.

136
00:07:32,026 --> 00:07:33,547
I don't know what to do.

137
00:07:33,987 --> 00:07:34,928
They email to FHIR.

138
00:07:35,609 --> 00:07:40,312
FHIR goes usually to the DRI and comms and whoever else is responsible for monitoring

139
00:07:40,332 --> 00:07:41,013
things at the moment.

140
00:07:43,094 --> 00:07:47,798
Now, as a practical standpoint, unless you have really strong reason to believe that

141
00:07:47,838 --> 00:07:50,219
someone is deliberately pranking your internal FHIR account...

142
00:07:50,985 --> 00:07:52,987
There can be no penalties for a false alarm.

143
00:07:54,589 --> 00:07:56,051
What you want here is for your people

144
00:07:56,071 --> 00:07:58,493
to have a way to let whoever has to be the adult this week

145
00:07:58,533 --> 00:07:59,174
to know about it.

146
00:07:59,614 --> 00:08:01,056
And if you penalize them for not doing

147
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,138
the research ahead of time, well, they're

148
00:08:03,158 --> 00:08:04,199
not going to tell you what you need to know,

149
00:08:04,219 --> 00:08:05,541
and you don't want to drown out that signal.

150
00:08:07,823 --> 00:08:09,865
As always, you want to support your people with training.

151
00:08:10,246 --> 00:08:11,767
If they're going to be speaking for communications

152
00:08:11,787 --> 00:08:12,768
or another role for the company.

153
00:08:13,482 --> 00:08:17,224
If you're a small company, you may actually have no general staff who aren't leadership,

154
00:08:17,464 --> 00:08:19,566
in which case, support yourselves.

155
00:08:20,146 --> 00:08:21,246
You should be good to yourselves.

156
00:08:22,007 --> 00:08:23,848
Which brings us to leadership.

157
00:08:24,588 --> 00:08:27,790
Now, Angela's going to talk about how this can go wrong in more detail when we talk about

158
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:31,772
crisis communications, but seriously, the biggest thing for leadership to do is do no

159
00:08:31,832 --> 00:08:32,012
harm.

160
00:08:33,267 --> 00:08:38,210
Even off-the-cuff comments by someone who is perceived as having a strong identity as a founder or leader of the company

161
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,633
can do damage that your communications and community management people cannot overcome.

162
00:08:43,253 --> 00:08:48,577
If the head of the company says something that drives people away, or offends them, or otherwise causes problems,

163
00:08:49,824 --> 00:08:53,165
No one is going to believe that the community manager saying,

164
00:08:53,285 --> 00:08:56,126
oh no, that was a problem, has any authority whatsoever.

165
00:08:56,166 --> 00:08:58,167
They're clearly there as a puppet saying whatever

166
00:08:58,187 --> 00:09:00,088
they were supposed to say to make everybody happy.

167
00:09:00,548 --> 00:09:02,889
If you are in a leadership role strongly identified

168
00:09:02,929 --> 00:09:05,930
with the company, what you say has disproportionate weight.

169
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,284
On the flip side, you can use this power to back up your people.

170
00:09:11,725 --> 00:09:15,670
If you've got someone saying, wow, yeah, we know we promised you a patch this week,

171
00:09:16,170 --> 00:09:20,055
but it turned out it was a really difficult problem and it's going to be next month.

172
00:09:21,055 --> 00:09:23,675
well that's not good news you want to be giving out but someone's giving it out

173
00:09:24,056 --> 00:09:27,016
you're probably gonna catch a lot of grief from your customer base of people

174
00:09:27,056 --> 00:09:28,497
calling them everything but you know

175
00:09:28,517 --> 00:09:31,858
a sweet child of God and

176
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:35,959
that's okay but now you can come in as a leader with your established authority

177
00:09:35,979 --> 00:09:38,800
and the weight of your reputation and say no this is a really good person they

178
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:41,260
were doing the right thing we just misjudged we're sorry

179
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:45,021
and you can lend that credibility there it's good to be able to have that but

180
00:09:45,061 --> 00:09:47,722
it's more important to just not make things worse

181
00:09:52,583 --> 00:09:56,244
And we've talked enough about training, we should probably talk in more detail about training.

182
00:09:57,625 --> 00:10:00,405
So I love playbooks. Flat out, they're wonderful.

183
00:10:01,345 --> 00:10:04,166
One of the nice things about playbooks is that they are a fail-soft solution.

184
00:10:04,706 --> 00:10:09,047
Having one playbook is always better than having none, two is better than one, and so on.

185
00:10:09,547 --> 00:10:12,388
This means you don't need to solve the problem right away.

186
00:10:13,088 --> 00:10:16,849
You can order in pizza, have a staff party occasionally at the end of the week,

187
00:10:16,889 --> 00:10:19,370
and say, hey, let's brainstorm a problem and then do a playbook for it.

188
00:10:20,643 --> 00:10:23,245
Playbooks need to be focused and short.

189
00:10:23,985 --> 00:10:25,946
If they're complex, they won't get used.

190
00:10:26,046 --> 00:10:28,087
The end result of a playbook is either an action

191
00:10:28,227 --> 00:10:29,527
or a pointer to another playbook.

192
00:10:31,388 --> 00:10:32,709
Now, the other thing you'll find

193
00:10:32,729 --> 00:10:34,089
is if you're making playbooks,

194
00:10:34,109 --> 00:10:36,270
they're gonna shape both how you manage your infrastructure

195
00:10:36,410 --> 00:10:37,311
and build your software,

196
00:10:37,511 --> 00:10:38,791
and they'll have real ramifications

197
00:10:38,811 --> 00:10:40,172
when you realize what your critical paths are.

198
00:10:40,592 --> 00:10:42,593
And we're gonna see that as we walk through one right now.

199
00:10:43,954 --> 00:10:45,534
And yes, if you've ever done customer support,

200
00:10:45,995 --> 00:10:47,215
a playbook looks an awful lot

201
00:10:47,255 --> 00:10:48,516
like a customer support flowchart.

202
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:50,336
All right.

203
00:10:51,190 --> 00:10:52,791
The example I'm going to use is Heartbleed.

204
00:10:53,712 --> 00:10:55,513
And the reason I'm using Heartbleed as an example

205
00:10:56,133 --> 00:10:59,195
is because the developers didn't actually do anything wrong.

206
00:11:00,515 --> 00:11:01,476
They used cryptography.

207
00:11:02,156 --> 00:11:03,677
They used it appropriately.

208
00:11:04,637 --> 00:11:05,798
They did not invent their own.

209
00:11:06,318 --> 00:11:07,739
They did not even implement their own.

210
00:11:08,139 --> 00:11:11,981
They used the industry standard library for their platform.

211
00:11:12,522 --> 00:11:15,323
Everything we tell people to do from a security perspective.

212
00:11:16,164 --> 00:11:18,685
But because of a vulnerability in the platform,

213
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:22,262
They were absolutely flat-out vulnerable,

214
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:27,186
and the fix was horrific because the keys were compromised,

215
00:11:27,566 --> 00:11:28,646
or potentially compromised.

216
00:11:30,568 --> 00:11:31,749
And so we're going to use that as an example,

217
00:11:31,789 --> 00:11:34,430
because the whole point of this is your ability

218
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:36,412
to protect yourself from being compromised

219
00:11:36,452 --> 00:11:37,252
is pretty much gone.

220
00:11:38,133 --> 00:11:40,154
You can make it harder, but something like Heartbleed,

221
00:11:40,875 --> 00:11:42,436
there was nothing you could do as a developer.

222
00:11:42,496 --> 00:11:45,558
Unless you are a cryptographer who was auditing Heartbleed,

223
00:11:45,658 --> 00:11:47,339
or auditing OpenSSL and found it,

224
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,020
you didn't really have an option.

225
00:11:50,259 --> 00:11:53,501
And so the whole purpose of this talk is to plan for what happens afterwards.

226
00:11:53,521 --> 00:11:56,322
And that's why I said it was not a security talk or a technical talk per se.

227
00:11:57,102 --> 00:11:58,843
So let's walk down the tree.

228
00:11:59,803 --> 00:12:02,785
There are reports of a critical vulnerability in a library or component.

229
00:12:04,365 --> 00:12:05,606
And the first question is, do we use it?

230
00:12:05,646 --> 00:12:08,747
And you'll note that don't know is defaulting to we're vulnerable.

231
00:12:09,909 --> 00:12:13,311
We'll talk about this again when we talk about planning and assets, but this not only puts

232
00:12:13,351 --> 00:12:18,213
us in a safer security posture overall, it also acts as negative feedback against skimping

233
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,954
on your upfront analysis because suddenly you have more work.

234
00:12:21,634 --> 00:12:24,876
Because if we know that we don't use that, you log it as not affected and you're done.

235
00:12:24,916 --> 00:12:27,277
You can go back to sleep, it's four in the morning on a Saturday and you're over.

236
00:12:27,797 --> 00:12:28,337
Problem solved.

237
00:12:30,158 --> 00:12:33,360
Well, if we use it or we don't know, we go to page two.

238
00:12:34,708 --> 00:12:38,811
Now, this may come as a surprise coming from a security specialist, but not everything

239
00:12:38,891 --> 00:12:40,152
is drop everything now.

240
00:12:41,113 --> 00:12:44,195
If the attack is not being exploited in the wild, it can wait until the start of the next

241
00:12:44,215 --> 00:12:44,775
business day.

242
00:12:45,276 --> 00:12:47,237
However, there should be a monitored situation.

243
00:12:47,257 --> 00:12:50,499
If it does start being exploited, this decision point should also be revisited.

244
00:12:51,212 --> 00:12:53,072
And again, you have to look at the ramifications.

245
00:12:53,493 --> 00:12:56,234
For those familiar with the recent Drupalageddon bug,

246
00:12:56,254 --> 00:12:58,655
Drupal has said, basically, if you did not

247
00:12:58,735 --> 00:13:01,456
patch your site within seven hours of the update being

248
00:13:01,496 --> 00:13:03,077
available, they considered almost certain

249
00:13:03,097 --> 00:13:04,098
that your site was compromised.

250
00:13:04,678 --> 00:13:06,179
Because seven hours later, they were

251
00:13:06,199 --> 00:13:08,100
seeing automated attacks hitting servers they manage.

252
00:13:10,753 --> 00:13:15,094
Now, obviously, as we said earlier, most studios do not have in-house lawyers or legal staff,

253
00:13:15,114 --> 00:13:18,755
so the legal role is likely to be someone who is informed as to the studio's contractual

254
00:13:18,775 --> 00:13:23,117
legal obligations and is authorized to call a real lawyer if the case requires it.

255
00:13:24,437 --> 00:13:27,278
So it's not being exploited in the wild.

256
00:13:27,298 --> 00:13:31,259
We're going to schedule a meeting with our DRI, our QA, our legal, engineering, and comms

257
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,560
for the start of the next business day.

258
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:36,381
Otherwise, well, we go straight to the meeting.

259
00:13:37,101 --> 00:13:38,482
And this is all hands on deck.

260
00:13:40,703 --> 00:13:44,166
First of all, we need to produce tests that verify the vulnerability.

261
00:13:44,746 --> 00:13:46,928
And the reason for this is, first you want to make sure you have it,

262
00:13:46,968 --> 00:13:48,529
and second of all, you want to make sure you fixed it.

263
00:13:49,850 --> 00:13:51,552
So, right now, verify that you've got it.

264
00:13:51,992 --> 00:13:56,556
While that's going on, engineering ops and QA need to start preparing the fix and prepare for deployment.

265
00:13:57,196 --> 00:14:01,200
And at the same time, ops, comms, and legal are busy working on the scope of damage,

266
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:04,743
communications, business partners, and any other remediation.

267
00:14:06,555 --> 00:14:09,660
You'll note this playbook does not have replace all of our website certificates

268
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:13,746
and we probably didn't have a what to do when our SSL for our site is now completely compromised

269
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:18,012
but in the wake of Heartbleed, we probably want to sit down and write another playbook for that

270
00:14:18,052 --> 00:14:19,534
and we do that as a separate callout.

271
00:14:19,574 --> 00:14:23,139
We check for remediation specific playbooks, specific remediation playbooks.

272
00:14:24,905 --> 00:14:26,465
Now, there's something you may have noticed here.

273
00:14:26,685 --> 00:14:30,226
We've got QA and engineering in two, ops in two,

274
00:14:30,286 --> 00:14:31,727
and comms and legal in one.

275
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,967
And if you only have one person in each of those roles,

276
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:34,627
you have a problem.

277
00:14:35,188 --> 00:14:37,008
It may not be a problem you can get away with,

278
00:14:38,549 --> 00:14:40,849
or that you can avoid because you're a very small shop.

279
00:14:41,509 --> 00:14:43,810
But you want to look at what your critical path looks

280
00:14:43,850 --> 00:14:45,010
like when things go pear-shaped.

281
00:14:45,611 --> 00:14:47,491
And the critical path says I need these people.

282
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:48,751
And if I only have one of them and they

283
00:14:48,771 --> 00:14:50,852
need to be doing two things at once, that's a problem.

284
00:14:51,332 --> 00:14:52,713
And that may indicate cross-training,

285
00:14:52,733 --> 00:14:53,753
or it may indicate a hiring need.

286
00:14:56,863 --> 00:15:00,324
Now, we'll cover it a little bit more when we talk about critical paths,

287
00:15:00,364 --> 00:15:03,204
but there's an anti-pattern that crops up in development very often,

288
00:15:03,424 --> 00:15:04,825
and I just call it Build Boy.

289
00:15:06,085 --> 00:15:07,665
No one wants to be stuck doing the build,

290
00:15:07,685 --> 00:15:09,946
so whoever does it first tends to get stuck with it.

291
00:15:10,046 --> 00:15:11,946
Now, that's problematic in the best cases,

292
00:15:12,586 --> 00:15:15,767
but having your critical path for all updates go through one person

293
00:15:15,847 --> 00:15:17,548
is an absolute disaster waiting to happen.

294
00:15:18,728 --> 00:15:20,908
So, how long does a build test cycle take?

295
00:15:21,821 --> 00:15:27,044
If it takes 96 hours for you to do a build and complete regress, that's the minimum amount

296
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:30,426
of time, even if the patch were available, before you could have everything out.

297
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:33,188
How automated is your build test cycle?

298
00:15:33,228 --> 00:15:36,710
Does someone have to keep puttering at it or you can simply put something up there and

299
00:15:36,750 --> 00:15:38,451
fire it up and let automated tests start running?

300
00:15:38,932 --> 00:15:40,613
And who is available to build and deploy?

301
00:15:45,207 --> 00:15:48,328
Now, deployment of updates is not necessarily something you control.

302
00:15:49,109 --> 00:15:52,290
Some sales channels give you the opportunity to update whenever you feel like.

303
00:15:52,350 --> 00:15:55,572
If you want to update twice a day and three times on Sunday, that's fine with them.

304
00:15:56,652 --> 00:15:58,353
Others, you have a real approval process.

305
00:15:59,094 --> 00:16:03,116
The time to find out if there's a way to expedite that is not when your house is on fire.

306
00:16:04,636 --> 00:16:08,518
So, during your planning, reach out to your sales partners and figure out,

307
00:16:08,618 --> 00:16:12,260
is there a way, if things were really bad, that we could get an expedited review

308
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:13,201
so we could get this up there?

309
00:16:14,137 --> 00:16:19,059
If things are catastrophically bad, there's a vulnerability in the software that's letting you compromise backend servers,

310
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:22,021
you may need to shut things down. Can you do that?

311
00:16:22,161 --> 00:16:24,942
If you had to, in an emergency, what are the ramifications?

312
00:16:25,002 --> 00:16:27,844
Can you just shut down multiplayer, or would you have to shut down the whole thing?

313
00:16:29,005 --> 00:16:32,967
All of this is planning for deployment that you should do as part of making your playbooks,

314
00:16:32,987 --> 00:16:36,028
and also just ahead of time, know what your requirements and capabilities are.

315
00:16:36,449 --> 00:16:40,271
If you show up that you have a problem, that we can't get an update deployed fast enough, well...

316
00:16:41,667 --> 00:16:45,470
That has to go back and close the loop and inform your playbooks because now we have

317
00:16:46,030 --> 00:16:47,951
more of a lead time before we can fix something.

318
00:16:50,853 --> 00:16:54,035
As we saw in the playbook example, we need to know what we use and what we protect when

319
00:16:54,055 --> 00:16:54,756
building our playbooks.

320
00:16:55,594 --> 00:17:00,598
One thing to recall is that some of the incidents that would trigger a playbook will also involve some of our assets being unavailable.

321
00:17:01,018 --> 00:17:08,464
Having the playbook or asset lists on a wiki is nice, but if the incident is internal network failure or VPN failure, that wiki is suddenly a lot less useful.

322
00:17:08,824 --> 00:17:13,848
You probably actually do want to have hard copies of your asset lists in your playbooks and at least have the DRI have them.

323
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,471
Now, another thing, we're talking about what customer data do we have?

324
00:17:20,273 --> 00:17:22,535
Disk space is cheap, liability is not.

325
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:27,415
When you're looking at things like customer data, ask yourself what is the business case

326
00:17:27,455 --> 00:17:28,076
for having it?

327
00:17:28,537 --> 00:17:31,340
Because if you don't have it, they can't steal it.

328
00:17:33,203 --> 00:17:37,188
Just because you think you might need something someday does not make keeping it now a good

329
00:17:37,268 --> 00:17:37,608
idea.

330
00:17:40,512 --> 00:17:41,093
For example...

331
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:46,309
It may be that we don't want to take the credit cards ourselves, we want to use a third-party

332
00:17:46,369 --> 00:17:52,191
payment, whether that's Apple or Google or Microsoft or Pay by Cash or any one of a number

333
00:17:52,211 --> 00:17:53,331
of other places, PayPal.

334
00:17:53,931 --> 00:17:55,792
Now all of those places will take a cut.

335
00:17:56,512 --> 00:17:58,053
They're going to step in and they're going to take a cut.

336
00:17:58,073 --> 00:18:02,134
What you're basically doing is buying yourself a hedge against liability.

337
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:03,775
But here's the thing.

338
00:18:04,415 --> 00:18:08,537
If I don't need their credit card number, then I may not need their real name and physical

339
00:18:08,597 --> 00:18:08,897
address.

340
00:18:10,578 --> 00:18:11,218
If I don't need it...

341
00:18:11,732 --> 00:18:14,995
don't keep it. Again, if you look at the data breaches,

342
00:18:15,616 --> 00:18:18,739
what are people worried about losing? Credit cards, addresses, email addresses.

343
00:18:20,801 --> 00:18:21,822
Depending on the

344
00:18:22,342 --> 00:18:25,725
platform you're on, you may not even need the real email address. Again,

345
00:18:26,246 --> 00:18:29,149
unless you have a business case to hold on to something, when you're doing your

346
00:18:29,189 --> 00:18:32,171
planning, try and get rid of as many consumer assets as you possibly can.

347
00:18:33,295 --> 00:18:38,018
because that's your liability. If our database doesn't have anything that the consumer would

348
00:18:38,058 --> 00:18:41,280
be hurt if it got out, it doesn't have their email, it doesn't have their address, it doesn't

349
00:18:41,300 --> 00:18:45,322
have their credit card, then even if someone pops the back-end database, I don't need to

350
00:18:45,402 --> 00:18:49,304
say anything about it, I don't need to go into a comms emergency because we didn't lose

351
00:18:49,384 --> 00:18:53,186
anything that anybody else cares about. Great. They got our source code, they got our assets,

352
00:18:53,326 --> 00:18:57,449
whatever. That's our loss, it's not your loss as a customer, and therefore I don't need

353
00:18:57,469 --> 00:18:58,029
to tell you.

354
00:19:01,581 --> 00:19:06,465
And as I said earlier, one of the things that comes out of this is we're trying to find out what roles need to be filled,

355
00:19:07,165 --> 00:19:11,608
and we may discover that there are going to be some categories of problems that only have one person who can act.

356
00:19:12,938 --> 00:19:14,519
Now sometimes this is unavoidable.

357
00:19:14,539 --> 00:19:16,881
Either the studio is small enough that this is inevitable,

358
00:19:17,421 --> 00:19:19,222
or the role requires someone to speak formally

359
00:19:19,262 --> 00:19:21,364
on behalf of the company, which is by definition

360
00:19:21,404 --> 00:19:23,945
a limited number of people, but often it indicates

361
00:19:23,985 --> 00:19:25,046
a dangerous critical path.

362
00:19:25,586 --> 00:19:27,328
If only one person can release a new build,

363
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:28,789
you're in a precarious situation.

364
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:31,430
Vacations, illness, bus, offer letter.

365
00:19:32,211 --> 00:19:33,051
This is a problem.

366
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:36,274
This will inform your need to cross-train and hire.

367
00:19:37,018 --> 00:19:37,579
And that's good.

368
00:19:38,099 --> 00:19:39,700
For one thing, it's really easy to say, look,

369
00:19:41,481 --> 00:19:43,962
we're going to make everybody learn how to do the build so

370
00:19:43,982 --> 00:19:45,683
that everyone can go on vacation.

371
00:19:46,863 --> 00:19:48,064
You don't necessarily have to say,

372
00:19:48,164 --> 00:19:49,965
so that if anyone leaves, we don't discover we have

373
00:19:50,005 --> 00:19:51,165
no ability to ever update again.

374
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:57,548
And when we get down to the rest of the roles,

375
00:19:58,689 --> 00:19:59,970
we're talking about communications.

376
00:20:00,090 --> 00:20:01,190
And so I'll turn things over to Angela.

377
00:20:06,662 --> 00:20:07,123
Thanks, Dave.

378
00:20:07,903 --> 00:20:09,384
Again, my name's Angela, and I'm here

379
00:20:09,404 --> 00:20:11,605
to talk about a role that lies outside the comfort

380
00:20:11,625 --> 00:20:13,747
zone of most tech folk, and that's communications.

381
00:20:14,667 --> 00:20:16,508
Because comms has some unique dealings

382
00:20:16,548 --> 00:20:18,429
with not just developers, but with legal

383
00:20:18,529 --> 00:20:21,391
and the outside world, and because comms functions,

384
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:24,873
as Dave mentioned, as the handoff entity between DRIs,

385
00:20:25,274 --> 00:20:26,975
there are some things we need to talk about separately.

386
00:20:27,435 --> 00:20:28,115
So here I am.

387
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:42,179
Most of us are pretty good communicators under normal circumstances, thanks to e-book and Facebook and Tumblr and text and the Twitters and the phones and having conversations now and then with normal human beings, which is nice.

388
00:20:43,060 --> 00:20:49,245
But in a crisis, communications become something that benefits from a lot of structure and as much planning and expertise as possible.

389
00:20:50,106 --> 00:20:53,608
I assume most of you would rather be working on the technical problem.

390
00:20:54,709 --> 00:20:57,350
as opposed to explaining it to the least technical,

391
00:20:57,471 --> 00:21:00,953
most hostile user who can manage to personally reach you,

392
00:21:01,193 --> 00:21:03,234
probably at three in the morning at home, am I right?

393
00:21:04,735 --> 00:21:06,757
Believe it or not, some folks do actually specialize

394
00:21:06,817 --> 00:21:09,359
in handling communications in crisis situations,

395
00:21:09,599 --> 00:21:12,201
and my half of the talk explains what those folks

396
00:21:12,241 --> 00:21:14,642
need to function and what you will need to do

397
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,443
if there's no one around to do that job.

398
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,245
Before we start, does anybody here watch Scandal?

399
00:21:20,046 --> 00:21:20,906
Familiar with Scandal?

400
00:21:22,405 --> 00:21:27,727
No. Oh, that's so good. We're going to live in the real world and not be TV crisis comms people.

401
00:21:28,207 --> 00:21:29,588
They dress so much better than me.

402
00:21:32,149 --> 00:21:38,892
Okay. The job of the crisis communications person is to tell your story in difficult situations.

403
00:21:38,992 --> 00:21:45,815
One of the leading crisis comms practitioners describes his job as making terrible news just bad, and bad news good.

404
00:21:47,935 --> 00:21:48,736
So let's look at this slide.

405
00:21:49,498 --> 00:21:51,581
Questions and answers, that should be clear enough, right?

406
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,305
Give your comps people the facts.

407
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:54,887
Trust them to tell your story.

408
00:21:55,585 --> 00:22:00,827
and give them the facts. This is really important. We have current events to talk about in this one.

409
00:22:01,387 --> 00:22:07,148
Crisis comms folk do not have the privileged communication status that you would have with, say, legal counsel,

410
00:22:07,989 --> 00:22:13,130
but they still need to be operating with as much of the truth as they possibly can.

411
00:22:14,210 --> 00:22:18,532
Anybody following the John Gomeshi scandal up in Canada right now?

412
00:22:19,724 --> 00:22:23,205
a fellow who, a broadcaster for CBC before that.

413
00:22:23,305 --> 00:22:25,626
He ran a band called Moxie Fruvist.

414
00:22:27,027 --> 00:22:30,088
Anyway, he's in some personal trouble right now.

415
00:22:30,569 --> 00:22:34,731
And the guy was not forthright to his exceedingly expensive

416
00:22:34,771 --> 00:22:35,811
crisis comms team.

417
00:22:36,651 --> 00:22:39,633
And went out on Facebook with a long thing

418
00:22:39,673 --> 00:22:42,594
about how he didn't do what he's accused of doing, and no, no,

419
00:22:42,674 --> 00:22:44,755
it didn't happen, and it didn't happen the way they said.

420
00:22:44,775 --> 00:22:48,917
And because he's a really articulate, charming guy.

421
00:22:50,687 --> 00:22:56,591
It sounded good and they were winning and then more effects came out and they were losing

422
00:22:56,751 --> 00:22:59,532
and then the crisis comps team fired their client.

423
00:23:00,193 --> 00:23:04,435
Here's a word of advice. If your crisis comps team, the people who specialize in trouble,

424
00:23:04,835 --> 00:23:08,457
don't want your brand of trouble, you have a very interesting brand of trouble.

425
00:23:10,733 --> 00:23:15,676
Outreach and response. Outreach is to use a terrible word, proactive.

426
00:23:15,736 --> 00:23:18,598
Response is reacting to questions and statements made by others.

427
00:23:19,399 --> 00:23:22,722
Comms faces outward to the public, inward to the company.

428
00:23:22,902 --> 00:23:25,083
Again, lawyers, execs, as well as devs.

429
00:23:25,183 --> 00:23:29,207
And again, as Dave said, we can't always count on lawyers being in-house,

430
00:23:29,287 --> 00:23:35,711
but they will be dealing with probably whoever you have to be liaison to real counsel and real counsel itself.

431
00:23:37,214 --> 00:23:38,595
Now, to be honest, comms is a game.

432
00:23:39,056 --> 00:23:41,017
There are objectives, there are success conditions,

433
00:23:41,477 --> 00:23:43,859
and because this is a crisis, you have time pressures,

434
00:23:43,939 --> 00:23:45,060
you have achievement pressures.

435
00:23:46,201 --> 00:23:48,483
In the Gomeshi case, you can win the news cycle,

436
00:23:48,623 --> 00:23:49,784
you can get your story out there,

437
00:23:49,804 --> 00:23:51,465
and then you can lose the next news cycle,

438
00:23:51,525 --> 00:23:53,206
or you can lose all the news cycles,

439
00:23:53,266 --> 00:23:55,368
and the snowball keeps getting bigger.

440
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:59,031
Most importantly, there is a terrain map for this process,

441
00:23:59,051 --> 00:24:00,372
and even if you're not familiar with it,

442
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:02,874
everyone else you will deal with in a crisis is.

443
00:24:04,415 --> 00:24:07,877
The press especially has its way of doing things and the better you are at

444
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:12,321
understanding and countering how they operate and how social networks operate with your story and so forth,

445
00:24:12,901 --> 00:24:17,524
the more effective your comms effort will be. You cannot beat the system that exists.

446
00:24:18,145 --> 00:24:19,806
All you can do is convince it that you're winning.

447
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:27,385
I want to take two slides and run through the components you will need to build in a

448
00:24:27,445 --> 00:24:28,366
crisis comps plan.

449
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,711
You will need these for both outreach and reactive.

450
00:24:32,512 --> 00:24:34,694
This first slide covers the three must-have items.

451
00:24:34,875 --> 00:24:37,618
After that, we're going to go through a few fancier additions.

452
00:24:38,179 --> 00:24:40,962
I want to go back and disagree with something Dave said about playbooks.

453
00:24:42,786 --> 00:24:48,168
In the case of comms, I'm a big fan of set it and forget it as much as you possibly can.

454
00:24:48,208 --> 00:24:53,990
Build your playbook and don't touch it unless you really, unless there is an extraordinary circumstance.

455
00:24:54,850 --> 00:24:59,312
Because if you have a flowchart memorized for that, if you have your playbook memorized, everything's going to flow.

456
00:24:59,872 --> 00:25:05,354
Trust me, comms will have enough drama dealing with the specifics of the incident, including trying to understand it.

457
00:25:05,514 --> 00:25:06,975
Your comms people are probably not technical.

458
00:25:07,755 --> 00:25:09,876
Learn the components. Do not reinvent the wheel here.

459
00:25:10,988 --> 00:25:11,989
Okay, talking points.

460
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:15,211
These are the basis of everything else you would develop.

461
00:25:15,491 --> 00:25:17,312
They are sentences your spokespeople

462
00:25:17,432 --> 00:25:19,033
and anyone else you engage with,

463
00:25:19,514 --> 00:25:21,115
anybody on the company who might be speaking,

464
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:24,657
should be able to pretty much recite word for word.

465
00:25:24,697 --> 00:25:25,678
I'm not joking about that.

466
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:27,579
They are your point.

467
00:25:27,999 --> 00:25:30,320
A comms person on average spends more time and care

468
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,981
per word building talking points

469
00:25:32,442 --> 00:25:34,723
than on any other of the many components you will see.

470
00:25:37,042 --> 00:25:39,104
Each of these sentences conveys one point.

471
00:25:39,164 --> 00:25:41,165
They are simple, unambiguous, precise.

472
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:44,028
They are short, 20 words apiece is too many,

473
00:25:44,068 --> 00:25:47,850
which means all my slides fail my own metric there.

474
00:25:48,991 --> 00:25:51,413
Your comms team should be doing everything in its power

475
00:25:51,453 --> 00:25:54,115
to make sure that these statements get out perfectly,

476
00:25:54,255 --> 00:25:55,136
are not misquoted.

477
00:25:55,836 --> 00:25:57,197
I'm going to give you a test now.

478
00:25:58,138 --> 00:26:01,681
What, do you think, would be the problem with a talking point that says,

479
00:26:02,322 --> 00:26:06,786
there are reports that our foo game is causing eye blisters, but no proof exists that this is true.

480
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,968
What did I do wrong there? Anybody?

481
00:26:08,988 --> 00:26:11,250
Oh, you're so quiet.

482
00:26:12,271 --> 00:26:15,114
The problem is, I put words in a row that said,

483
00:26:15,134 --> 00:26:17,897
our foo game is causing eye blisters.

484
00:26:18,357 --> 00:26:20,800
That's awesome, and that's the quote the news picks up.

485
00:26:22,293 --> 00:26:28,136
Present the facts. We are aware of reports that customers are experiencing issues with one of our popular games.

486
00:26:28,856 --> 00:26:33,879
Really, really dry. But do you see how the gotcha quote people can't do anything with that?

487
00:26:34,279 --> 00:26:37,300
If somebody's going to hang in with that, where do they start? You gave them no hook.

488
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:43,003
It's business writing. There's a place for memorable language in this process. The talking points ain't it.

489
00:26:44,082 --> 00:26:46,043
The statement, on the other hand, is it.

490
00:26:46,623 --> 00:26:48,724
The statement's interesting because it's the one thing that

491
00:26:48,764 --> 00:26:49,965
sounds like humans are speaking.

492
00:26:51,245 --> 00:26:53,546
It's also the first and often the only thing

493
00:26:53,586 --> 00:26:56,868
you can send out intact to press or anybody asking you

494
00:26:56,928 --> 00:26:57,388
questions.

495
00:26:58,229 --> 00:27:00,510
It's a nice paragraph, but you can do two, whatever,

496
00:27:00,950 --> 00:27:03,271
that you can mail to reporters, post it on your website,

497
00:27:03,311 --> 00:27:04,952
put it on social media, anywhere you

498
00:27:04,972 --> 00:27:06,633
need to make the statement.

499
00:27:07,414 --> 00:27:11,316
Clear, accurate, quotable, serious, respectful, positive.

500
00:27:12,356 --> 00:27:19,181
Your goal is to assure people that you are on the case and as much as you can to give them the information they need to settle the problem in their own mind.

501
00:27:21,002 --> 00:27:32,530
As we, the Gnomeschi case we just discussed, the statement was beautiful, memorable, positive, and was not written with enough knowledge to get out in front of what the next news cycle would be.

502
00:27:32,650 --> 00:27:35,572
So, and it was long, it was extremely long, but most importantly,

503
00:27:36,410 --> 00:27:38,552
It lacked understanding of what was to come.

504
00:27:38,953 --> 00:27:40,275
Wouldn't have said what was to come,

505
00:27:40,315 --> 00:27:42,537
but would have been aware and started countering.

506
00:27:42,758 --> 00:27:44,920
Think chess.

507
00:27:44,980 --> 00:27:47,423
Some folks use the statement to bring in third party voices who

508
00:27:47,463 --> 00:27:49,766
are independent that can support what you're saying,

509
00:27:49,846 --> 00:27:51,789
either in a quote in the statement itself,

510
00:27:51,929 --> 00:27:53,951
or more usually by getting permission

511
00:27:54,071 --> 00:27:56,294
to include their names and contact information.

512
00:27:56,924 --> 00:27:59,526
in mailings to the press, not social media but the press.

513
00:28:00,567 --> 00:28:03,890
The right independent voice can make a big difference to a reporter who's just

514
00:28:03,910 --> 00:28:05,891
sifting through a lot of opinions on the situation.

515
00:28:06,312 --> 00:28:10,615
Yours is only one, even if it is your product. A tough part about doing this is

516
00:28:10,635 --> 00:28:12,257
that someone's got to go line that guy up

517
00:28:12,497 --> 00:28:14,219
and talk to them, figure out what they might say.

518
00:28:16,249 --> 00:28:25,879
A good example of how this works well in the tech world is that there are certain companies that make a point of briefing analyst firms before a major release, especially with security bulletins.

519
00:28:26,419 --> 00:28:35,429
They brief them, they figure out who's kind of on the same page as they are with what's going on, and they will suggest to the press that, oh, talk to this analyst, this analyst, and this analyst.

520
00:28:36,069 --> 00:28:41,078
Now, when I was a reporter, I did not trust those because I knew how the sausage was made.

521
00:28:41,699 --> 00:28:45,306
But you will find that especially in a crisis situation where things are moving quickly,

522
00:28:45,326 --> 00:28:48,973
other reporters have different opinions on that. So, always good.

523
00:28:50,419 --> 00:28:58,344
A FAQ, as we seem to be saying these days, some comps folk will call this a Q&A, but that kind of implies a linearity that doesn't exist.

524
00:28:59,445 --> 00:29:08,650
This consists basically of pretty much every question a comps person can get with a well-crafted, full-sentence answer to a question.

525
00:29:09,171 --> 00:29:10,232
all the questions possible.

526
00:29:11,092 --> 00:29:12,694
I actually really like doing this component

527
00:29:12,734 --> 00:29:14,175
when I have these little projects,

528
00:29:14,235 --> 00:29:16,618
because it helps everybody see what the parameters are,

529
00:29:16,678 --> 00:29:21,042
and sometimes raises issues that the DRI or legal or others

530
00:29:21,122 --> 00:29:23,104
haven't really, you get a lot of,

531
00:29:23,564 --> 00:29:24,886
really, somebody's going to ask that?

532
00:29:25,106 --> 00:29:26,007
Yes, really, they are.

533
00:29:28,119 --> 00:29:29,781
How long has your foo game been shipping?

534
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:31,303
Complete sentence response.

535
00:29:31,744 --> 00:29:34,206
Will you be offering refunds for buyers of the foo game?

536
00:29:34,267 --> 00:29:35,388
Complete sentence response.

537
00:29:35,929 --> 00:29:38,411
How could the foo game have shipped without review

538
00:29:38,532 --> 00:29:40,013
from the Centers for Disease Control?

539
00:29:40,314 --> 00:29:40,574
Whatever.

540
00:29:41,079 --> 00:29:41,979
full sentence response.

541
00:29:43,100 --> 00:29:44,020
Not necessarily an answer.

542
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:46,801
The goal is to sound informed about the progress

543
00:29:46,821 --> 00:29:48,821
of the investigation and to give information

544
00:29:48,841 --> 00:29:52,462
that has been internally vetted as accurate and safe

545
00:29:52,502 --> 00:29:53,003
to discuss.

546
00:29:53,803 --> 00:29:57,404
You never want to say, we don't know, or please, God,

547
00:29:57,604 --> 00:29:58,204
no comment.

548
00:29:58,324 --> 00:29:58,804
Don't do this.

549
00:29:59,845 --> 00:30:01,665
The end of the FAQ is always, I'll

550
00:30:01,705 --> 00:30:04,306
have to check on that and get back to you, and then do it.

551
00:30:05,706 --> 00:30:08,367
As you have guessed from all that, not for publication.

552
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:10,068
You use the parts you need, and you keep the rest

553
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:10,628
under your hat.

554
00:30:13,014 --> 00:30:15,536
Quickly on these, these are some specialized tools available.

555
00:30:16,596 --> 00:30:19,518
If your team already does video, like if you put a lot of demos

556
00:30:19,578 --> 00:30:22,900
up on YouTube, and you feel you have something that's

557
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:27,363
communicated well, I think Dave's design,

558
00:30:27,723 --> 00:30:29,124
no, this is not exploded.

559
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,865
It's just different, is a good example of that.

560
00:30:31,886 --> 00:30:34,107
That might be a way you can make your point very efficiently.

561
00:30:35,984 --> 00:30:39,126
I'm not personally a fan of podcasts for this purpose,

562
00:30:39,226 --> 00:30:43,208
but there are a few podcasters from the Nerdist on down

563
00:30:43,248 --> 00:30:44,069
worth talking to.

564
00:30:44,789 --> 00:30:46,731
For crisis purposes, you treat those guys as press.

565
00:30:48,772 --> 00:30:49,512
An open letter.

566
00:30:49,652 --> 00:30:53,955
If you have a big name on your leadership team, very big name

567
00:30:54,015 --> 00:30:56,136
on leadership team, this is why you pay them money

568
00:30:56,316 --> 00:30:57,657
to go out and be this guy.

569
00:30:58,687 --> 00:31:05,330
the corollary to Dave's putting your leadership out there to add veracity to whatever you're saying.

570
00:31:06,611 --> 00:31:10,313
The trick here is that a lot of times your confs folk are writing it.

571
00:31:10,433 --> 00:31:12,534
You are sock puppeting your leadership team.

572
00:31:14,575 --> 00:31:15,616
Your confs people write it.

573
00:31:15,896 --> 00:31:17,376
The person whose name is going on it goes,

574
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:19,457
Yeah, that sounds like something I'd say, and you proceed.

575
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:21,919
It gives them more time to actually work the problem.

576
00:31:23,301 --> 00:31:25,002
Tweets post-social.

577
00:31:25,622 --> 00:31:27,663
More on that in a second, but the short thing here is

578
00:31:28,223 --> 00:31:31,585
if you are already active on those, that's great.

579
00:31:31,945 --> 00:31:34,826
If you are not, now is really, really not the time to start.

580
00:31:35,906 --> 00:31:37,907
I threw a backgrounder on here.

581
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,608
I go back and forth on whether I should have.

582
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:42,149
This is a really bold tactic if you're in the

583
00:31:42,269 --> 00:31:44,470
best defense is a good offense stance.

584
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,031
If you have someone on here, staff,

585
00:31:47,051 --> 00:31:48,652
who is well-versed on a topic.

586
00:31:48,692 --> 00:31:51,673
Let's take OpenSSL to use Dave's example on Heartbleed.

587
00:31:52,309 --> 00:31:55,952
And if your company is not actively involved in the crisis,

588
00:31:57,353 --> 00:31:59,195
you know, heart bleed, but you knew you weren't affected,

589
00:31:59,975 --> 00:32:01,497
if you feel you have the bandwidth

590
00:32:01,517 --> 00:32:02,618
to speak out and be experts,

591
00:32:03,339 --> 00:32:04,620
you know what, that's marketing to me,

592
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:07,482
but some people feel that's a good time to act.

593
00:32:08,303 --> 00:32:08,924
And let's move on.

594
00:32:10,925 --> 00:32:12,787
Okay, staffing, personnel, access.

595
00:32:13,868 --> 00:32:14,529
You know what you need.

596
00:32:15,289 --> 00:32:15,870
Who does the work?

597
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:18,152
How does it get to the people that it needs to see?

598
00:32:19,695 --> 00:32:23,397
First off, about this slide, these venue bullets, whatever,

599
00:32:23,617 --> 00:32:25,458
are in ascending order of both the ease

600
00:32:25,518 --> 00:32:29,100
with which comms can be done and the lack of control

601
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:31,121
you will have over the output once it's out there.

602
00:32:32,042 --> 00:32:33,923
Most importantly, these are really, really fluid

603
00:32:33,943 --> 00:32:34,343
these days.

604
00:32:34,383 --> 00:32:37,785
The pressed read Twitter, a random email guy

605
00:32:37,885 --> 00:32:40,507
can put your entire correspondence on blast

606
00:32:40,667 --> 00:32:41,147
on Tumblr.

607
00:32:42,048 --> 00:32:42,828
Things move around.

608
00:32:43,609 --> 00:32:45,190
At every one of these levels of engagement,

609
00:32:45,230 --> 00:32:47,291
it's important to, again, know your map, have your plan.

610
00:32:48,826 --> 00:33:02,111
Email. We talked about having a DRI box. We talked about some public-facing emails. Everybody comfortable with the idea of having a public-facing email that sometimes says stuff to the outside world?

611
00:33:03,272 --> 00:33:04,552
It's quiet out there.

612
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:12,875
Keep an eye on it. The email addresses Dave mentioned, such as fire, I think those are a wonderful idea. You don't make those public.

613
00:33:15,729 --> 00:33:18,511
By that, you need to have something where people can tell you things.

614
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:25,935
Some companies use the secure at metric, or eBay and PayPal do spoof.

615
00:33:25,975 --> 00:33:33,560
That's also a useful tool if you're set up to notify users of changes or whatnot through

616
00:33:33,580 --> 00:33:34,080
that address.

617
00:33:36,166 --> 00:33:42,651
Active or at least actively monitored presence on social media is important, and I think most of you probably do that to some extent.

618
00:33:43,932 --> 00:33:46,994
How many of you have somebody on your staff who just kind of does it anyway?

619
00:33:47,074 --> 00:33:52,638
They blog or they're posting to Tumblr or they're Facebooking or they're tweeting about work stuff on a regular basis.

620
00:33:52,678 --> 00:33:55,800
This may have a massive intersection with your rock stars.

621
00:33:56,941 --> 00:33:57,782
Anybody have that guy?

622
00:33:57,802 --> 00:33:59,803
We're going to need to talk about that guy.

623
00:34:00,824 --> 00:34:04,767
And the rest of you, pay attention, because you've probably got that guy and you don't know it.

624
00:34:06,722 --> 00:34:07,403
Now there's the press.

625
00:34:07,683 --> 00:34:10,164
If you have PR folk who are already in touch with the press,

626
00:34:11,284 --> 00:34:12,505
they have the contact information,

627
00:34:12,545 --> 00:34:14,606
the business relationship to handle the outputs.

628
00:34:15,846 --> 00:34:17,807
If not, press will probably reach out to you

629
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:20,188
through social media or through any phone

630
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:21,709
or contact information they can find.

631
00:34:22,109 --> 00:34:25,211
That thing you put on your main webpage

632
00:34:25,231 --> 00:34:27,832
a million years ago is probably gonna get a workout.

633
00:34:29,513 --> 00:34:32,434
If you are contacted by press in a strange situation,

634
00:34:33,315 --> 00:34:34,355
ask for their contact info.

635
00:34:35,129 --> 00:34:36,910
Tell them you will phone or email them back.

636
00:34:37,971 --> 00:34:45,757
Google them. For the love of God, Google them to find out if they are who they say they are and what sort of entity they are, what they cover.

637
00:34:45,837 --> 00:34:48,439
Learn a little bit about this person and then reach out.

638
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:53,462
The objective in any case is to funnel all this action to a manageable field of play.

639
00:34:53,583 --> 00:34:59,107
So that's going to be managing where you engage, where your comps person engages, and what you're saying and putting out there.

640
00:34:59,127 --> 00:34:59,887
That's your messaging.

641
00:35:01,718 --> 00:35:05,302
In good comps, people can usually prioritize outreach and response efforts and have the

642
00:35:05,322 --> 00:35:09,706
patience to remember that the loudest voice is not always the truest measure of landscape.

643
00:35:11,408 --> 00:35:12,569
That's how, so who.

644
00:35:12,589 --> 00:35:15,552
So proprietors, here's your list of hats.

645
00:35:15,832 --> 00:35:16,213
Be strong.

646
00:35:17,847 --> 00:35:18,447
We have three roles.

647
00:35:19,328 --> 00:35:20,948
First role, comms.

648
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,369
You may have someone in-house with some or all

649
00:35:23,389 --> 00:35:24,109
of the expertise.

650
00:35:24,149 --> 00:35:25,570
As I said, it's a specialized field.

651
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,671
A lot of companies aren't staffed like that.

652
00:35:28,691 --> 00:35:32,092
Related to crisis comms, you have PR, public relations.

653
00:35:32,172 --> 00:35:33,973
Actually, it's more accurately press relations.

654
00:35:34,993 --> 00:35:43,859
Some of you may do that in-house already. For those of you who use a firm outside, they may in turn have crisis comms folks on staff to specialize in meltdowns.

655
00:35:44,399 --> 00:35:54,185
And then further afield of marketing, I don't find marketing folk as a rule very comfortable with these activities because bad things are happening and you know how marketing folk get and bad things get weird.

656
00:35:55,045 --> 00:35:59,548
But this may be your first line of defense on things like wordsmithing or social media presence.

657
00:36:01,174 --> 00:36:04,834
COMS folks are good at communicating information, but you do not want them working in a vacuum.

658
00:36:05,515 --> 00:36:08,455
So this means that not only are COMS folks talking to the outside world,

659
00:36:08,495 --> 00:36:12,456
they have got to have access to someone on staff who has a deep understanding of the problem.

660
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,477
Now, that should be your DRI.

661
00:36:15,337 --> 00:36:18,978
These conversations, I will warn you ahead of time, are not always fun for the DRI.

662
00:36:19,458 --> 00:36:21,278
You are tired, you are stressed,

663
00:36:21,358 --> 00:36:24,719
and you feel like the questions you're getting are the dumbest thing you've ever heard.

664
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:30,603
But, you know, bear with it, the comps person probably agrees, but they can't tell you that right now.

665
00:36:31,523 --> 00:36:36,267
And as a reminder, as Dave pointed out, if you keep comps looped in, you get a payback

666
00:36:36,507 --> 00:36:39,128
because it's the continuity you need to hand off between DRIs.

667
00:36:40,089 --> 00:36:44,052
You have a class of creatures with comps that lives to document stuff.

668
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,093
So use that superpower of theirs.

669
00:36:48,292 --> 00:36:50,553
In some situations you're going to want a public spokesperson.

670
00:36:51,073 --> 00:36:54,636
That could be super simple, just having some quotes out there attributed to one of your

671
00:36:54,676 --> 00:36:55,676
leadership team or whatever.

672
00:36:57,695 --> 00:37:00,476
Again, the comps people tend to sock puppet leadership teams on those.

673
00:37:01,096 --> 00:37:05,358
On the other end of the scale, you could have a spokesperson who's talking directly to reporters.

674
00:37:05,398 --> 00:37:06,998
You may have them on camera.

675
00:37:07,018 --> 00:37:12,000
And if somebody in your company is already media trained in that process, fantastic.

676
00:37:12,020 --> 00:37:12,580
That's your guy.

677
00:37:13,160 --> 00:37:17,222
Do not get cute and decide that the current crisis would be a good time for one of your

678
00:37:17,262 --> 00:37:19,783
leaders to do his first television appearance.

679
00:37:20,771 --> 00:37:23,433
As Dave put it, do not put your people in a position to fail.

680
00:37:24,194 --> 00:37:26,956
And if you're not sure about this, here's a rule of thumb.

681
00:37:27,677 --> 00:37:30,059
If you do not know what pivot to talking point means

682
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:32,821
by the time I get to the comma, you

683
00:37:32,861 --> 00:37:34,242
are not ready to speak in public.

684
00:37:34,662 --> 00:37:35,483
Talk about that later.

685
00:37:35,603 --> 00:37:38,265
But if you have any doubts, no, you are not ready.

686
00:37:39,692 --> 00:37:41,413
Sole proprietors, you poor kids.

687
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:44,614
If you have no comps team, have the playbook at least.

688
00:37:45,154 --> 00:37:49,155
The parts I listed before are what a crisis comps team would develop on your behalf

689
00:37:49,215 --> 00:37:50,355
and stick to pretty closely.

690
00:37:50,955 --> 00:37:54,777
If you have the presence of mind to develop them and stick to them, you might be okay.

691
00:37:55,337 --> 00:37:58,478
It's business writing like any other thing, and you can learn to do this.

692
00:37:58,578 --> 00:38:01,478
It is a learnable skill and not a difficult learnable skill.

693
00:38:02,652 --> 00:38:09,674
That said, I want to say that there are occasions on which you take a deep breath and you buy some expertise.

694
00:38:10,654 --> 00:38:14,235
And you don't have to keep them on staff. This is ad hoc expertise you're buying.

695
00:38:15,496 --> 00:38:26,440
When I was a reporter, I was covering a story in which a very small business that posited itself as family friendly managed to hire a guy who had a thing for teenage girls.

696
00:38:27,989 --> 00:38:32,092
very small company and it was going to be an absolute disaster when the news got out.

697
00:38:32,993 --> 00:38:36,896
And they called their lawyers and their lawyers told them to hire crisis comms.

698
00:38:37,336 --> 00:38:44,782
I never talked to the people, the family who ran the company without the crisis comms person acting as a mediator there.

699
00:38:44,802 --> 00:38:51,848
And that person had enough distance on the subject to be able to handle it, to be able to handle the family's...

700
00:38:52,871 --> 00:38:58,536
extreme distress at what this person had done to their business, to handle the different legal questions that were coming up,

701
00:38:58,556 --> 00:39:04,461
to handle the fact that I was one of about 40 reporters who felt they needed to talk to them every hour on the hour.

702
00:39:05,682 --> 00:39:08,924
Kept everything calm, kept everything clear, and in the end, the business survived.

703
00:39:09,285 --> 00:39:12,808
That was not a foregone conclusion going into that one by any stretch.

704
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:16,655
The family got to present their side of what happened,

705
00:39:16,916 --> 00:39:19,177
and they dealt with the things they needed to deal with.

706
00:39:19,517 --> 00:39:20,858
Didn't let themselves get sidetracked.

707
00:39:20,878 --> 00:39:23,600
You know, I can't do that cost-benefit analysis for you,

708
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,001
but it's something to keep in mind

709
00:39:25,021 --> 00:39:27,383
that sometimes you're gonna drop a dime,

710
00:39:27,563 --> 00:39:29,124
and if your company is at stake,

711
00:39:29,144 --> 00:39:30,945
this is worth spending the money on.

712
00:39:30,965 --> 00:39:34,948
So let's talk about how you know you're in trouble.

713
00:39:36,316 --> 00:39:37,656
Call is coming from inside the house.

714
00:39:38,216 --> 00:39:40,997
Possible that fire ad address Dave discussed

715
00:39:41,017 --> 00:39:42,117
will be your first sign of trouble.

716
00:39:42,517 --> 00:39:43,817
You'll hear about something in the news.

717
00:39:44,057 --> 00:39:46,498
Later that day, somebody walks up and says, guess what?

718
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:51,279
Given all your givens, that's really not bad.

719
00:39:51,919 --> 00:39:52,980
It gives you the head start.

720
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:54,640
And for comms, that's really crucial.

721
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:57,101
Dave talked about speed of response.

722
00:39:57,161 --> 00:39:58,741
And this sort of conforms to the idea

723
00:39:58,761 --> 00:39:59,981
of wait till the next business day.

724
00:40:02,081 --> 00:40:07,085
First thing everybody on staff needs to do, to quote the wise men of Insane Clown Posse, is stop talking.

725
00:40:07,425 --> 00:40:10,087
I believe it might have been do nothing or sit down or something.

726
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:14,910
But anyway, first thing you need to do is stop talking outside.

727
00:40:14,930 --> 00:40:16,832
You have your playbooks in place, it's time to work it.

728
00:40:17,492 --> 00:40:21,275
Everybody, above all things, needs to understand this is not the time for tweeting,

729
00:40:21,795 --> 00:40:25,878
not the time for thinking aloud online in your blogs, on Twitter with friends.

730
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:30,001
not saying anything flippant or casual,

731
00:40:30,041 --> 00:40:32,722
or even talking about how bad your workload is today.

732
00:40:33,303 --> 00:40:34,864
You remember that guy we talked about?

733
00:40:34,964 --> 00:40:36,665
The one who kind of does his own thing,

734
00:40:36,705 --> 00:40:37,905
tweets about work stuff on his own?

735
00:40:38,446 --> 00:40:39,406
Yeah, go find him.

736
00:40:39,827 --> 00:40:40,487
Tell him no.

737
00:40:40,647 --> 00:40:41,908
Tell him to sit down.

738
00:40:42,008 --> 00:40:43,849
Put it as clearly as you can.

739
00:40:44,549 --> 00:40:45,850
Because somebody's gonna ask him.

740
00:40:45,950 --> 00:40:47,931
If he's out there and getting good feedback from this,

741
00:40:48,032 --> 00:40:49,472
this is, as a reporter,

742
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,233
that was the first guy I went looking for.

743
00:40:51,254 --> 00:40:53,195
I didn't want to talk to PR people.

744
00:40:53,555 --> 00:40:54,856
I wanted to talk to the loudmouth.

745
00:40:56,537 --> 00:41:02,159
This is sometimes, by the way, when you figure out who on your staff is looking out for their own brand rather than yours.

746
00:41:03,199 --> 00:41:04,399
Hashtag firing offense.

747
00:41:06,260 --> 00:41:12,302
The advantages you gain, again, it's framing your narrative, choosing your playing field, and that head start.

748
00:41:12,662 --> 00:41:15,823
These are all preferable start conditions to what could happen.

749
00:41:18,184 --> 00:41:20,605
Oh, those pleasant calls from the friendly hackers.

750
00:41:20,765 --> 00:41:22,085
People at Dave's group, for instance.

751
00:41:22,125 --> 00:41:23,126
Here's a friendly hacker now.

752
00:41:23,166 --> 00:41:23,726
Doesn't he look good?

753
00:41:24,678 --> 00:41:28,380
So if it's not someone on your stack, you get an email from someone like Dave who says,

754
00:41:28,420 --> 00:41:32,423
hey, I found a problem with your product. You know, it's not ideal, but you still have

755
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:36,486
a really good chance of everything being okay as long as you keep it cool, keep the

756
00:41:36,526 --> 00:41:42,110
conversation civil, and keep it private. On the other hand, in-house, behind the scenes,

757
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:46,333
you are accelerating your activity. At this point, all comms hands should be on deck and

758
00:41:46,373 --> 00:41:51,776
briefed, but, you know, at like parade rest or whatever. Your hair is not yet on fire.

759
00:41:53,945 --> 00:42:03,251
One person, probably DRI, should be engaging with this researcher, and that should either be by email or, if you must, by phone or by Skype.

760
00:42:04,272 --> 00:42:10,136
Ask them for confidentiality, but assume that anything goes wrong, your conversations will be made public.

761
00:42:10,196 --> 00:42:16,080
Or even if it didn't go wrong. Sometimes you'll get somebody who's so excited to hear from a company they really care about.

762
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:21,412
they will go out on Twitter and put on blast everything you thought you said privately about the bug.

763
00:42:22,712 --> 00:42:25,113
It hurts, but it happens. Keep your cool.

764
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:29,114
In-house, again, you're keeping comms looped in, you're keeping legal looped in.

765
00:42:29,134 --> 00:42:33,015
I will point out that both comms and legal are not just good at documents,

766
00:42:33,055 --> 00:42:36,356
but very good at keeping quiet when things are on speakerphone. Just saying.

767
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:41,997
When dealing with outsiders, do not whine. Do not lie to them.

768
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:44,938
And don't gloat if it turns out the researcher was wrong.

769
00:42:44,998 --> 00:42:45,958
This is really important.

770
00:42:47,109 --> 00:42:51,671
Try, above all things, to keep in mind that this person reached out to you, which by definition,

771
00:42:51,731 --> 00:42:54,613
they're your friend, or at least your ally, at least for now.

772
00:42:55,973 --> 00:43:00,695
If your investigation finds that the problem isn't your fault, you be clear with them and be very specific about that.

773
00:43:00,895 --> 00:43:03,176
Treat them as collaborators, is what I tell people.

774
00:43:03,636 --> 00:43:05,817
Am I understanding the thing you found correctly?

775
00:43:06,358 --> 00:43:09,139
Anything our analysis missed?

776
00:43:09,179 --> 00:43:10,960
Did you see something we're not seeing?

777
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:16,146
In most cases, I advise more carrot and less stick with these guys.

778
00:43:16,487 --> 00:43:20,087
They know you have lawyers and they know you have power in this situation.

779
00:43:20,808 --> 00:43:27,469
If they start making details public in an aggressive way, if they start demanding money or whatever, that's different and they know that.

780
00:43:27,769 --> 00:43:31,030
At that point, your legal folk are going to have some thoughts on how to proceed.

781
00:43:31,550 --> 00:43:37,112
But above all things, remember that reaching out to you, that call that says,

782
00:43:37,152 --> 00:43:39,232
Hey, I found something in your product, no matter how...

783
00:43:40,158 --> 00:43:43,539
you aggressively worded, no matter how, you know,

784
00:43:43,559 --> 00:43:44,259
na, na, na, na, na.

785
00:43:44,979 --> 00:43:46,319
It's not an aggressive act.

786
00:43:46,479 --> 00:43:47,239
These are your friends.

787
00:43:49,240 --> 00:43:50,320
These people are not your friends.

788
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:53,321
Once the press and the general public

789
00:43:53,581 --> 00:43:55,301
have taken an interest in your situation,

790
00:43:55,581 --> 00:43:56,702
the risk of damage is higher.

791
00:43:57,542 --> 00:43:58,722
If you play your cards right, you

792
00:43:58,762 --> 00:44:00,442
may at least come out no worse than you are.

793
00:44:00,542 --> 00:44:02,423
And by the way, yes, your hair is on fire.

794
00:44:04,016 --> 00:44:06,337
At this point, you need your comps plan locked and loaded.

795
00:44:06,357 --> 00:44:10,759
And a good rule of thumb in this case is the wider the interest in your situation

796
00:44:10,859 --> 00:44:13,680
spreads, the simpler you're going to have to make your message.

797
00:44:13,740 --> 00:44:15,961
So you may be going back and making it even simpler,

798
00:44:16,301 --> 00:44:17,601
adding talking points going.

799
00:44:18,862 --> 00:44:20,162
A video game is.

800
00:44:20,923 --> 00:44:21,723
You'd be amazed.

801
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:24,664
Odds are really good that interest in your situation

802
00:44:24,704 --> 00:44:27,305
will stay with the press you're already used to, the gaming press.

803
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:29,227
you may be computer press.

804
00:44:29,367 --> 00:44:31,429
But if the mainstream for some reason takes an interest,

805
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:32,591
New York Times comes calling,

806
00:44:33,131 --> 00:44:36,495
prepare to explain everything as simply as possible.

807
00:44:37,736 --> 00:44:38,777
If they don't know your product,

808
00:44:39,118 --> 00:44:40,780
if they don't know the gaming space at all,

809
00:44:40,860 --> 00:44:43,062
there are a lot of things you're gonna have to spell out.

810
00:44:43,182 --> 00:44:46,045
Be patient, especially since you're going to find

811
00:44:46,105 --> 00:44:47,247
some of them are very arrogant

812
00:44:47,287 --> 00:44:48,608
about their lack of knowledge.

813
00:44:50,399 --> 00:44:53,345
Always be polite, always be responsive, always, you know,

814
00:44:53,526 --> 00:44:55,891
I'll get back to you instead of I don't know,

815
00:44:56,071 --> 00:44:58,295
never say no comment, we talked about that.

816
00:45:00,028 --> 00:45:03,411
For the most part, if things get to this condition, you're in response only mode.

817
00:45:03,431 --> 00:45:04,632
You're not doing outreach.

818
00:45:04,832 --> 00:45:06,353
There's one exception to that.

819
00:45:07,094 --> 00:45:13,959
If you are forced to shut down some or all of your servers or any kind of access as part

820
00:45:13,979 --> 00:45:19,483
of deployment, as Dave was describing, I think, you want to communicate that to anybody who

821
00:45:19,503 --> 00:45:19,943
will listen.

822
00:45:19,963 --> 00:45:21,745
No surprises on outages.

823
00:45:21,865 --> 00:45:24,166
It looks so much worse if they don't know it's coming.

824
00:45:25,836 --> 00:45:29,800
If your, by the way, if your DRI fails to warn the comps person about an outage,

825
00:45:29,860 --> 00:45:32,924
the comps person is legally allowed to kick them really hard.

826
00:45:33,144 --> 00:45:34,126
You can look that up, it's true.

827
00:45:36,419 --> 00:45:37,479
Friends in faraway places.

828
00:45:37,519 --> 00:45:40,121
If you've previously had good interactions with somebody

829
00:45:40,141 --> 00:45:42,903
in the press or somebody in the industry who's high profile,

830
00:45:42,943 --> 00:45:44,944
as we discussed, consider reaching out.

831
00:45:45,585 --> 00:45:48,246
With reporters, that can be as simple as an email.

832
00:45:48,266 --> 00:45:50,428
So, hey, I know you probably heard about this thing

833
00:45:50,468 --> 00:45:52,049
and I wondered if you had any questions for me.

834
00:45:52,789 --> 00:45:53,470
Don't be pushy.

835
00:45:53,650 --> 00:45:55,831
Just once, one email is more than sufficient.

836
00:45:55,871 --> 00:45:57,453
Do not mail bomb your reporters.

837
00:45:58,413 --> 00:46:00,815
But if you have that good credit build up, at this point,

838
00:46:00,835 --> 00:46:02,476
it might be a really good time to spend that.

839
00:46:04,976 --> 00:46:05,737
Maybe you got lucky.

840
00:46:06,157 --> 00:46:08,779
Maybe by now your investigation, you guys have come back.

841
00:46:08,819 --> 00:46:09,880
It's like, nope, not us.

842
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:10,600
We're not affected.

843
00:46:10,660 --> 00:46:11,201
It's not a bug.

844
00:46:11,281 --> 00:46:12,562
It's somebody else's bug.

845
00:46:13,062 --> 00:46:13,402
Say so.

846
00:46:14,063 --> 00:46:14,603
Just say so.

847
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:16,444
Write another statement.

848
00:46:16,464 --> 00:46:18,066
It says the investigation has concluded.

849
00:46:18,626 --> 00:46:19,487
Here's the situation.

850
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:21,948
You make sure it gets to all the people and places

851
00:46:21,988 --> 00:46:25,051
that you have interacted with in this process.

852
00:46:25,151 --> 00:46:27,352
Again, your comms person is keeping a list of that

853
00:46:27,392 --> 00:46:27,773
or should be.

854
00:46:29,622 --> 00:46:34,885
I advise you through SAT experience to say that you'll continue to monitor the situation

855
00:46:34,965 --> 00:46:39,847
because that's the safest thing to say in case it decides to claw its way back out of the grave.

856
00:46:41,148 --> 00:46:43,909
But I'm not here to tell you what that might mean in your case.

857
00:46:44,469 --> 00:46:45,850
Just put it out there for closure, though.

858
00:46:45,870 --> 00:46:50,432
So there's one more possibility, and you know, I saved the best for last.

859
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:58,004
With any luck, none of the things on this slide will ever happen to you.

860
00:46:58,024 --> 00:47:05,191
The plan works the same, but even your best efforts in these situations are probably not going to come to more than a draw.

861
00:47:05,771 --> 00:47:06,232
Sorry about it.

862
00:47:08,494 --> 00:47:11,176
You can break into jail and put yourself in a bad situation.

863
00:47:13,078 --> 00:47:17,763
Anybody follow Satya Nadella talking at the Grace Hopper conference a couple weeks ago?

864
00:47:19,042 --> 00:47:23,225
Our good CEO of Microsoft decided to get in there and

865
00:47:23,265 --> 00:47:26,048
talk about being nice and having good karma when asked

866
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,309
about how to improve salaries for women.

867
00:47:28,450 --> 00:47:31,092
It did not go well at the Women in Tech Conference for him.

868
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:34,695
And the saddest thing about that, by the way, was about

869
00:47:34,755 --> 00:47:37,817
two days before that, Satya had been the subject of a

870
00:47:38,197 --> 00:47:41,740
really positive piece from Vanity Fair.

871
00:47:41,820 --> 00:47:44,563
And for comms, that's a huge win.

872
00:47:44,603 --> 00:47:46,764
That is your entire year of.

873
00:47:48,145 --> 00:47:49,066
We won.

874
00:47:49,126 --> 00:47:50,306
It's an elaborate process.

875
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:50,967
There's interviews.

876
00:47:50,987 --> 00:47:51,627
There's fact checking.

877
00:47:51,667 --> 00:47:53,248
There's background work with the reporter.

878
00:47:53,688 --> 00:47:55,369
It is the highest profile thing.

879
00:47:55,429 --> 00:47:57,790
Your boss's mom reads Vanity Fair.

880
00:47:58,210 --> 00:48:00,932
And it all blew up in two days because their boss

881
00:48:01,072 --> 00:48:01,812
opened his mouth.

882
00:48:03,453 --> 00:48:05,854
If the security version of this happens to you,

883
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:07,455
you work the map.

884
00:48:07,495 --> 00:48:09,276
You get a decent open letter out there.

885
00:48:09,296 --> 00:48:12,417
It may take several, as it did with Microsoft.

886
00:48:12,677 --> 00:48:15,339
And you just kind of hope the news cycle goes and does

887
00:48:15,379 --> 00:48:16,339
something else pretty soon.

888
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:21,956
you could be the victim of an actually hostile security

889
00:48:21,996 --> 00:48:24,498
reporter, as opposed to the socially inept security

890
00:48:24,538 --> 00:48:25,439
reporter from before.

891
00:48:28,140 --> 00:48:29,901
Those of you who don't know about Pastebin,

892
00:48:29,962 --> 00:48:33,584
it's a site where some of your more black-headed researchers

893
00:48:33,604 --> 00:48:35,305
will drop information about vulnerabilities,

894
00:48:35,585 --> 00:48:38,847
or more pertinent here, perhaps, names and password

895
00:48:38,867 --> 00:48:40,668
and other information they've ganked from a.

896
00:48:41,271 --> 00:48:42,772
from insecure sites or services.

897
00:48:44,514 --> 00:48:47,956
In cases like those, you have some work to do to figure out what happened over on the tech side,

898
00:48:48,016 --> 00:48:53,280
but a lot of your comms will be following the lead of legal.

899
00:48:53,981 --> 00:48:57,484
And in some cases, the regulations covering breach notifications,

900
00:48:57,564 --> 00:49:00,886
if you didn't find your way clear to not keeping the credit card info.

901
00:49:01,767 --> 00:49:03,348
Let your lawyers lead. Just follow.

902
00:49:04,448 --> 00:49:08,993
Finally, there are some pretty random events where all you can do is work the plan and start thinking about how to rebuild.

903
00:49:09,914 --> 00:49:14,478
Everybody here know what Arby's is? The fast food chain restaurant? Yeah, okay.

904
00:49:15,505 --> 00:49:17,107
They're having a really weird year.

905
00:49:17,747 --> 00:49:21,811
Both Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert have been using them as a punchline for a little minute now.

906
00:49:21,831 --> 00:49:25,195
Saying some really mean, funny things about the quality of the food.

907
00:49:26,075 --> 00:49:30,179
And Arby's clearly has some really smart crisis comps people on retainer

908
00:49:30,259 --> 00:49:35,044
because instead of lawyering up and making them stop, they started sending over sandwiches.

909
00:49:36,045 --> 00:49:38,765
Here's some food, free food, total charm offensive.

910
00:49:38,845 --> 00:49:39,886
And it seems to be working.

911
00:49:40,446 --> 00:49:43,426
In the last few messages, Stewart and Colbert are saying,

912
00:49:43,546 --> 00:49:45,587
oh, hey, they sent over these sandwiches.

913
00:49:45,687 --> 00:49:46,607
They're forthright about it.

914
00:49:47,407 --> 00:49:48,908
But the comments have been kinder.

915
00:49:49,508 --> 00:49:51,788
And so now Arby's is in this interesting transition

916
00:49:51,828 --> 00:49:53,929
between being this mean punchline

917
00:49:54,009 --> 00:49:57,670
to this sort of recipient of free advertising.

918
00:49:57,770 --> 00:50:00,250
These mean things are said, but the edge is definitely off.

919
00:50:02,011 --> 00:50:03,451
I wouldn't say it's positive yet,

920
00:50:03,591 --> 00:50:05,091
as far as making lemonade out of.

921
00:50:06,092 --> 00:50:07,372
Beef, lemons, sorry.

922
00:50:09,633 --> 00:50:10,554
It's not bad.

923
00:50:11,434 --> 00:50:13,495
Sometimes that is exactly what a win looks like.

924
00:50:16,936 --> 00:50:18,517
And I, to the end of my slides.

925
00:50:19,397 --> 00:50:21,018
Questions, questions for Dave especially?

926
00:50:21,058 --> 00:50:22,118
He has an open mic, I think.

927
00:50:24,219 --> 00:50:25,320
Would you like to stand at this mic?

928
00:50:25,340 --> 00:50:26,800
We'll both stand up here because someone

929
00:50:26,840 --> 00:50:27,620
might actually have questions.

930
00:50:27,941 --> 00:50:28,601
But there's an edge.

931
00:50:29,481 --> 00:50:31,321
Who will win the edge of the podium?

932
00:50:31,382 --> 00:50:31,902
The edge will win.

933
00:50:32,102 --> 00:50:32,862
So are there any questions?

934
00:50:32,902 --> 00:50:37,383
There's a microphone up there or you can raise your hand and we'll ask and then we'll repeat

935
00:50:37,423 --> 00:50:37,843
the question.

936
00:50:40,264 --> 00:50:40,884
Any questions?

937
00:50:41,364 --> 00:50:42,765
Terrify them into submission.

938
00:50:43,025 --> 00:50:44,445
Or there's napping after lunch.

939
00:50:44,505 --> 00:50:45,225
It's one of the two.

940
00:50:45,245 --> 00:50:46,486
All right.

941
00:50:46,526 --> 00:50:49,407
Well, for a second I thought someone was going to ask a question.

942
00:50:50,207 --> 00:50:55,648
Well, in that case, thank you very much and have a great show.

943
00:51:03,833 --> 00:51:03,894
you
