1
00:00:27,683 --> 00:00:27,764
you

2
00:01:11,672 --> 00:01:15,474
He cannot be allowed to know this place.

3
00:01:15,494 --> 00:01:20,117
He will know everything.

4
00:01:20,137 --> 00:01:25,360
I'm willing to take full responsibility for the horrible events of the last 24 hours,

5
00:01:25,460 --> 00:01:27,801
but you must understand.

6
00:01:28,362 --> 00:01:31,303
Our interest in their world was purely...

7
00:02:03,870 --> 00:02:05,171
Good evening, everybody!

8
00:02:08,956 --> 00:02:11,680
I'm so happy to be speaking to you all this evening.

9
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,801
This is absolutely brilliant.

10
00:02:13,522 --> 00:02:17,107
I'm really, really happy to be speaking to you all, one, because I know it's five o'clock

11
00:02:17,167 --> 00:02:20,191
on a Wednesday afternoon, so I can guarantee that at least 30% of you are sober.

12
00:02:21,903 --> 00:02:25,724
The second thing is that I really have not had a chance to geek out on those wonderful

13
00:02:25,764 --> 00:02:28,444
details that went into the Gadoom soundtrack like I will tonight.

14
00:02:28,784 --> 00:02:32,125
So if you're here for those sort of geeky details, that's really what we're going to

15
00:02:32,165 --> 00:02:32,765
get into.

16
00:02:32,965 --> 00:02:33,745
Let's get started.

17
00:02:34,946 --> 00:02:38,546
Have you ever received a brief that went something like this?

18
00:02:40,887 --> 00:02:43,407
We want you to make music that no one has ever heard before.

19
00:02:46,068 --> 00:02:47,748
It needs to fit the game perfectly.

20
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:51,660
and be instantly loved by millions of fans.

21
00:02:53,001 --> 00:02:55,383
Now, if you're anything like me, when

22
00:02:55,423 --> 00:02:58,045
you get a brief like that, your initial reaction

23
00:02:58,105 --> 00:03:00,647
is to run into the bathroom, pour the cold tap on,

24
00:03:00,707 --> 00:03:02,869
crawl up into a little ball, and have a little cry.

25
00:03:04,610 --> 00:03:06,152
But what I'm going to talk to you about tonight

26
00:03:06,392 --> 00:03:08,954
is how you can execute a brief like this.

27
00:03:09,554 --> 00:03:11,216
And I'm going to discuss with you the lessons

28
00:03:11,236 --> 00:03:13,117
that I learned to enable you to do so.

29
00:03:15,139 --> 00:03:17,861
I first met the id Software team back in about mid-2014.

30
00:03:20,085 --> 00:03:22,826
They sent me a music design document that started like this.

31
00:03:24,187 --> 00:03:26,308
Doom is about demons on Mars, you have a shotgun,

32
00:03:26,328 --> 00:03:27,089
send them back to hell.

33
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:28,570
Cool.

34
00:03:30,351 --> 00:03:32,152
The second part of the brief went like this.

35
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:34,333
No guitars.

36
00:03:37,395 --> 00:03:40,016
We hate guitars, we do not want guitars in our game,

37
00:03:40,036 --> 00:03:41,037
do not put guitars in.

38
00:03:42,678 --> 00:03:44,959
Underneath that big section was a little line

39
00:03:44,979 --> 00:03:46,260
that said, I love synths.

40
00:03:47,681 --> 00:03:48,541
Cool, I can work with that.

41
00:03:50,176 --> 00:03:52,397
The third part of this brief went like this.

42
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:56,199
We want you to create music that nobody's ever heard before.

43
00:03:57,620 --> 00:04:01,421
It needs to fit the game perfectly and instantly loved

44
00:04:01,461 --> 00:04:02,422
by millions of fans.

45
00:04:04,263 --> 00:04:06,404
Now, Doom fans, they're not like Disney fans.

46
00:04:09,205 --> 00:04:10,766
If Doom fans don't like what you've done,

47
00:04:10,786 --> 00:04:11,887
they'll burn your house down.

48
00:04:14,528 --> 00:04:16,449
So let's say we take a brief like this, right?

49
00:04:16,529 --> 00:04:18,030
And we hand it to a piano player.

50
00:04:19,474 --> 00:04:22,496
Now, this piano player is going to channel in the demons,

51
00:04:23,016 --> 00:04:24,898
and they're going to channel in the hell,

52
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,799
and they're going to channel in the Mars.

53
00:04:27,879 --> 00:04:31,081
But what you're going to end up with is a solo piano piece.

54
00:04:32,602 --> 00:04:36,265
It's inspired by the brief, sure, but it's not

55
00:04:36,625 --> 00:04:38,306
an execution of the brief.

56
00:04:39,547 --> 00:04:42,789
Now, say you gave this same brief to a dubstep producer.

57
00:04:43,890 --> 00:04:45,511
This dubstep producer is going to take

58
00:04:45,591 --> 00:04:47,532
all those awesome demon growling basses.

59
00:04:48,682 --> 00:04:51,944
They're going to take some awesome Bell samples to get the hell thing in there,

60
00:04:51,964 --> 00:04:55,306
and they're going to mix in some bra samples to get in the Mars thing, right?

61
00:04:56,526 --> 00:04:59,368
But what you're going to end up with is a dubstep track.

62
00:05:00,669 --> 00:05:02,230
It's inspired by the brief.

63
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:07,853
Sure, it's got synths in there, but it's not an execution of the brief.

64
00:05:09,334 --> 00:05:12,476
Now, same again if you handed that exact same brief to a composer.

65
00:05:13,667 --> 00:05:17,489
And that composer's instant reaction is to open up their Cubase template

66
00:05:17,509 --> 00:05:19,510
that they've worked with for the last 10 projects.

67
00:05:20,410 --> 00:05:22,771
And they're going to use all their demon contact patches.

68
00:05:23,611 --> 00:05:25,552
And they're going to use all their hell contact patches.

69
00:05:25,572 --> 00:05:28,153
And they're going to use all of their Mars contact patches.

70
00:05:28,874 --> 00:05:31,815
You're going to end up with the same piece of music

71
00:05:31,855 --> 00:05:34,436
that that person has written for the last 10 projects.

72
00:05:35,196 --> 00:05:37,017
It's inspired by the brief, sure.

73
00:05:37,758 --> 00:05:39,418
But it's not an execution of the brief.

74
00:05:40,799 --> 00:05:42,460
Now, why have these three failed?

75
00:05:45,128 --> 00:05:47,209
The reason that they're failing in this example

76
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:51,612
is that they're going through the exact same process

77
00:05:51,652 --> 00:05:53,973
that they've always done every single time.

78
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:59,355
And you cannot expect to end up with a different outcome

79
00:06:00,336 --> 00:06:01,937
without changing the process.

80
00:06:03,457 --> 00:06:06,179
Change the process, change the outcome.

81
00:06:07,939 --> 00:06:09,760
Now, this is obviously a lot easier said than done.

82
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,961
We're very fearful of changing the process.

83
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,102
If you're anything like me, you suffer terribly from the fear of rejection.

84
00:06:18,763 --> 00:06:23,346
It's that fear of rejection that disables us from changing our process.

85
00:06:23,747 --> 00:06:24,047
Why?

86
00:06:25,708 --> 00:06:29,130
Because that's asking you to take everything you know and put it aside,

87
00:06:30,051 --> 00:06:31,352
come up with a new process

88
00:06:31,872 --> 00:06:33,833
in the hopes that you're going to reach something better.

89
00:06:35,114 --> 00:06:36,675
Now, as humans, we don't want to do that.

90
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:39,137
If something has worked a certain way before,

91
00:06:40,060 --> 00:06:42,621
We want to repeat that process to end up with what we perceive

92
00:06:42,661 --> 00:06:43,761
is going to be the same result.

93
00:06:44,141 --> 00:06:46,622
If it's gotten us a success in the past,

94
00:06:46,922 --> 00:06:49,163
we expect it's going to get us a success in the future.

95
00:06:50,704 --> 00:06:52,245
But in the ever-changing perpetual world

96
00:06:52,285 --> 00:06:54,285
that we live in, that's simply not the case.

97
00:06:56,566 --> 00:06:58,707
Change the process, change the outcome.

98
00:07:00,188 --> 00:07:05,010
But the key to this is working with a team that shares

99
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:06,290
this exact same philosophy.

100
00:07:10,249 --> 00:07:11,951
I was very excited to meet the Doom team.

101
00:07:12,612 --> 00:07:15,996
Ben picked me up from the hotel in Dallas and drove me all the way down to the Yid offices.

102
00:07:16,477 --> 00:07:19,120
The whole way he played this most incredible electronic music.

103
00:07:19,180 --> 00:07:19,781
It was great.

104
00:07:20,181 --> 00:07:22,685
It was all this weird sort of crazy like experimental stuff.

105
00:07:22,705 --> 00:07:23,145
There's no beat.

106
00:07:23,165 --> 00:07:24,046
There's no time signature.

107
00:07:24,066 --> 00:07:24,647
There's no nothing.

108
00:07:24,867 --> 00:07:26,089
It's just random sort of weirdness.

109
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,752
But he listens to this stuff every morning to inspire him.

110
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:31,514
When I entered the office, I met Chad Mosholder.

111
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:33,274
Chad was just finishing up the masters

112
00:07:33,354 --> 00:07:36,015
on his latest experimental electronic music album,

113
00:07:36,275 --> 00:07:36,915
this one here.

114
00:07:37,236 --> 00:07:38,556
Richard Devine did a remix on it.

115
00:07:38,576 --> 00:07:40,037
It's really, really fantastic stuff.

116
00:07:40,717 --> 00:07:42,878
I was then introduced to Chris Hite, the audio director.

117
00:07:43,338 --> 00:07:45,158
Now, Chris's room I couldn't even get into

118
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:47,019
because it was full of synthesizers.

119
00:07:47,399 --> 00:07:48,299
There was synths everywhere.

120
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:49,640
There was boxes of sounds everywhere.

121
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:50,560
I couldn't move.

122
00:07:51,621 --> 00:07:52,661
Straight away after meeting Chris,

123
00:07:52,701 --> 00:07:54,722
I was told that there was a very, very, very, very

124
00:07:54,762 --> 00:07:56,242
important audio-centric meeting.

125
00:07:56,774 --> 00:07:57,995
so we all rushed into a room.

126
00:07:58,715 --> 00:08:00,797
You see, Apex Twin had just dropped a couple of new tracks

127
00:08:00,817 --> 00:08:01,838
and we all had to have a listen.

128
00:08:04,301 --> 00:08:07,104
It was clear that these guys lived creativity

129
00:08:07,684 --> 00:08:09,346
and they breathed creativity.

130
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:15,504
In fact, every Wednesday evening after work, they had this fantastic concept called Weird Wednesday,

131
00:08:16,024 --> 00:08:20,367
where they'd all get into a studio together and just geek out for a while on any new plugins

132
00:08:20,667 --> 00:08:23,388
or any new pieces of equipment that they got, and they'd just jam.

133
00:08:24,129 --> 00:08:26,430
Now, they're not jamming in the conventional sense. There's not a tempo.

134
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:29,292
There's not a key signature that they're set into. They're not playing licks or anything.

135
00:08:30,172 --> 00:08:32,794
Chad over there on the far right is running his guitar through his laptop,

136
00:08:32,814 --> 00:08:35,795
and he's playing with all sorts of Bejeweled modules, making all sorts of cool sounds.

137
00:08:37,098 --> 00:08:39,920
Ben in the middle there at the background, he had a Eurorack system and he was making

138
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:42,921
all sorts of awesome, incredible sounds with these make noise modules that he just picked

139
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:43,061
up.

140
00:08:43,841 --> 00:08:47,602
That's Chris there on the left and he had his Ableton Live set up and he was making

141
00:08:47,642 --> 00:08:51,104
all sorts of processing and sound design based on what the other two guys were doing.

142
00:08:51,464 --> 00:08:53,625
I had my little laptop set down up at the front here.

143
00:08:54,245 --> 00:08:57,526
And the guys would record this and they'd just jam away making all sorts of weird, random

144
00:08:57,546 --> 00:09:01,048
sounds for two hours and they'd record it for archival reasons, but that wasn't really

145
00:09:01,088 --> 00:09:01,568
the purpose.

146
00:09:03,035 --> 00:09:06,440
The purpose here was to break away from any creative inhibitions.

147
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,004
It was to break away from anything that was stopping them from getting to their creativity.

148
00:09:11,125 --> 00:09:19,376
What they were doing was creating an environment where each of them felt comfortable in failure.

149
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:25,081
So I was so inspired after hanging out with these guys

150
00:09:25,101 --> 00:09:25,741
for a couple of days.

151
00:09:26,321 --> 00:09:28,202
And I couldn't wait to get back to my studio.

152
00:09:28,802 --> 00:09:29,682
And I was like, OK, cool.

153
00:09:29,702 --> 00:09:31,923
I'm going to come up with some really, really incredible

154
00:09:32,183 --> 00:09:34,304
creative doom music based on synths and stuff.

155
00:09:34,744 --> 00:09:35,905
So you know synths, right, dude?

156
00:09:35,965 --> 00:09:37,725
So we've got synths and there's hell, right?

157
00:09:37,745 --> 00:09:38,565
And hell's down below.

158
00:09:38,585 --> 00:09:41,687
So synths, we can put them down below like a sub, yeah?

159
00:09:41,727 --> 00:09:43,327
So let's start with like a sub part, right?

160
00:09:45,368 --> 00:09:45,848
Oh, man.

161
00:09:46,308 --> 00:09:47,169
GDC speakers.

162
00:09:47,729 --> 00:09:48,189
You kidding me?

163
00:09:48,209 --> 00:09:49,769
Ha, ha, ha, ha.

164
00:09:52,535 --> 00:09:53,295
That's what that sounds like.

165
00:09:53,375 --> 00:09:54,535
OK, it's really low subpart, right?

166
00:09:55,015 --> 00:09:55,876
But this is actually really good.

167
00:09:55,896 --> 00:09:57,116
See, the trouble with subnodes is

168
00:09:57,136 --> 00:09:59,917
when you're running them so low, as we demonstrated just then,

169
00:10:00,137 --> 00:10:01,077
you can't hear them.

170
00:10:02,638 --> 00:10:04,998
So instead, we want to take some high frequency content.

171
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,779
We want to add some high frequency

172
00:10:06,819 --> 00:10:10,000
content to those subparts in order for the player

173
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:11,780
to be able to hear them on their TV systems.

174
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,141
Now, one of the ways that I like to do this

175
00:10:14,201 --> 00:10:15,401
is to take white noise.

176
00:10:16,341 --> 00:10:19,262
And I take this white noise, and I turn the white noise on,

177
00:10:19,842 --> 00:10:21,243
and I turn the white noise off.

178
00:10:22,273 --> 00:10:25,715
at a rate that mirrors the frequency of the sub underneath.

179
00:10:27,176 --> 00:10:29,617
So what I'm essentially doing here is ring modulation, right?

180
00:10:30,157 --> 00:10:32,479
But it's ring modulation at the audio frequency.

181
00:10:33,239 --> 00:10:35,300
Now, the sub there that you couldn't even really hear

182
00:10:35,941 --> 00:10:39,743
was ringing at about 36.7 Hertz.

183
00:10:39,783 --> 00:10:43,485
So 36.7 times per second, that's bouncing or trying to bounce.

184
00:10:43,525 --> 00:10:44,286
It wasn't really bouncing.

185
00:10:45,886 --> 00:10:48,428
So when you take a white noise and you

186
00:10:48,468 --> 00:10:49,468
do that with the same sort of thing,

187
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:50,329
you end up with this sound.

188
00:10:54,191 --> 00:10:58,135
Alright, so when you combine those two together and you get the sub and the white noise, you

189
00:10:58,155 --> 00:10:58,996
can hear them together.

190
00:10:59,016 --> 00:11:01,299
You're probably not going to hear the full result on these speakers though.

191
00:11:03,682 --> 00:11:04,302
There's the sub.

192
00:11:07,186 --> 00:11:07,486
Right.

193
00:11:08,827 --> 00:11:10,650
I feel we're really testing the GDC speakers here.

194
00:11:12,135 --> 00:11:15,537
Now if you take this combination and you feed it through a distortion processor, you get

195
00:11:15,597 --> 00:11:17,317
all sorts of really interesting harmonics.

196
00:11:17,617 --> 00:11:20,659
In the next video here I'll run these two together through some distortion, you'll hear

197
00:11:20,699 --> 00:11:22,519
all sorts of interesting stuff start to happen.

198
00:11:23,180 --> 00:11:26,541
Now I'll turn the white noise off halfway through and you can hear what the distortion

199
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,782
is doing to the sub alone, and you'll notice that the white noise is actually doing quite

200
00:11:29,802 --> 00:11:30,022
a lot.

201
00:11:46,247 --> 00:11:47,168
All right, so there's where we go.

202
00:11:47,408 --> 00:11:49,068
So I was like, oh man, this is brilliant, right?

203
00:11:49,108 --> 00:11:49,509
Here we go.

204
00:11:49,529 --> 00:11:50,769
This is going to be the doom sound.

205
00:11:50,969 --> 00:11:53,150
We're going to take sine waves, and we're going to take noise,

206
00:11:53,170 --> 00:11:54,831
and we're going to run them through some distortion.

207
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:56,091
I'm an absolute genius.

208
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:56,771
This is brilliant.

209
00:11:57,172 --> 00:11:58,392
So I send this off to Chris, right?

210
00:11:58,412 --> 00:12:00,613
And I tapped out a really big email justifying the whole thing.

211
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:01,854
And I said, man, this is going to be awesome.

212
00:12:02,134 --> 00:12:03,434
Let this thing blow your mind.

213
00:12:03,734 --> 00:12:04,455
And then I send it off.

214
00:12:04,815 --> 00:12:07,356
I hit Send on the email, and I waited Chris's reply.

215
00:12:09,637 --> 00:12:10,497
He replied with this.

216
00:12:15,278 --> 00:12:18,401
Now you're only laughing there because you're suffering the same fear of rejection that

217
00:12:18,521 --> 00:12:19,082
I am, right?

218
00:12:19,542 --> 00:12:22,885
And there I am, I read that on my screen and I'm like, oh no, I've failed again, right?

219
00:12:23,165 --> 00:12:25,847
Time to go turn on the cold water in the shower and have a bit of a cry.

220
00:12:28,029 --> 00:12:29,991
But then underneath that, he had these lines.

221
00:12:32,073 --> 00:12:35,656
I feel you've taken the first step on a journey toward the perfect destination.

222
00:12:37,137 --> 00:12:37,697
Keep going.

223
00:12:38,798 --> 00:12:39,679
You're almost there.

224
00:12:41,485 --> 00:12:45,888
Now, instantly, I felt comfortable with failure.

225
00:12:47,189 --> 00:12:49,291
I wasn't worried about failing with this team.

226
00:12:51,252 --> 00:12:52,913
I was encouraged to be able to keep going.

227
00:12:52,993 --> 00:12:55,355
Chris understood what I was trying to do here,

228
00:12:55,935 --> 00:12:57,917
but rather than rejecting it outright

229
00:12:58,217 --> 00:13:00,358
and therefore rejecting me and my abilities,

230
00:13:01,579 --> 00:13:04,221
he was saying, keep going, you're on the right path.

231
00:13:05,442 --> 00:13:08,044
He was encouraging an environment

232
00:13:08,064 --> 00:13:09,585
where I felt comfortable in failure.

233
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:14,361
Now, it was clear after this that I really wasn't doing the right thing, right?

234
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,162
I knew in myself it wasn't correct.

235
00:13:16,522 --> 00:13:19,663
All I'd done is taken some sounds and ran them through distortion.

236
00:13:20,083 --> 00:13:21,364
I mean, that's not really amazing.

237
00:13:21,624 --> 00:13:22,464
I'm a guitar player.

238
00:13:22,504 --> 00:13:25,485
I made a living out of doing that exact thing for about 10 years.

239
00:13:26,545 --> 00:13:29,466
But what I needed to do was change the process, right?

240
00:13:30,386 --> 00:13:32,807
Change the process, change the outcome.

241
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:37,969
I'm a big fan of Doom 3.

242
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:41,212
I really, really quite enjoyed doing Doom 3.

243
00:13:41,552 --> 00:13:43,574
I really love the darkness that they were able to get into it.

244
00:13:43,594 --> 00:13:44,755
I really love storytelling.

245
00:13:45,216 --> 00:13:47,238
I thought it was such an amazing technical achievement

246
00:13:47,258 --> 00:13:49,139
that they were able to pull off back in 2004.

247
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,442
I found it really, really quite inspiring.

248
00:13:51,462 --> 00:13:52,543
It was an interesting project.

249
00:13:52,563 --> 00:13:56,226
Now, of course, the music that you're hearing there.

250
00:13:57,503 --> 00:14:00,925
Chris Vrenna had produced this track for Doom 3.

251
00:14:01,525 --> 00:14:03,166
Now Chris is an incredible person.

252
00:14:03,206 --> 00:14:04,827
I've only spoken to Chris a couple of times,

253
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,048
but his high level of music ability

254
00:14:07,128 --> 00:14:09,049
is only matched by his personality.

255
00:14:09,089 --> 00:14:10,590
He's a really, really wonderful person.

256
00:14:11,491 --> 00:14:13,392
And Chris, of course, played drums on Nine Inch Nails

257
00:14:13,432 --> 00:14:15,313
for many years and went on to play with Marilyn Manson

258
00:14:15,333 --> 00:14:16,013
and all that sort of stuff.

259
00:14:16,413 --> 00:14:17,194
Really, really great guy.

260
00:14:18,294 --> 00:14:20,195
But it was his experience with Nine Inch Nails

261
00:14:20,215 --> 00:14:21,096
that remembered something.

262
00:14:21,456 --> 00:14:23,297
I remembered that at one point, Nine Inch Nails

263
00:14:23,337 --> 00:14:24,298
toured with David Bowie.

264
00:14:26,149 --> 00:14:30,833
David Bowie himself is obviously a really incredible musician, and this reminded me of an interesting story.

265
00:14:38,798 --> 00:14:47,805
Back in 1977, when Bowie was in Berlin recording Heroes, he was working with a fascinating engineer named Tony Visconti.

266
00:14:49,415 --> 00:14:52,337
Now, due to the technical limitations that these guys were working with,

267
00:14:52,778 --> 00:14:56,721
they'd pretty much run out with tracks on this tape machine that they were using.

268
00:14:57,182 --> 00:14:58,883
They had one track left for vocals.

269
00:14:59,684 --> 00:15:02,246
But to get the full emotional impact of this song across,

270
00:15:02,586 --> 00:15:04,648
they needed to have reverb that was scalable.

271
00:15:05,689 --> 00:15:08,772
So Tony, the engineer, came up with this really incredible technique.

272
00:15:10,033 --> 00:15:12,915
He set up David Bowie in the middle of the studio here, right at the frontier.

273
00:15:13,616 --> 00:15:15,558
So David would be singing into that microphone.

274
00:15:17,005 --> 00:15:19,747
About 20 feet away from that would be a second microphone.

275
00:15:21,067 --> 00:15:23,669
Then at the end of the hall was a third microphone.

276
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:27,031
Now, microphones two and three at the back

277
00:15:27,091 --> 00:15:28,591
there were behind a gate.

278
00:15:29,272 --> 00:15:30,613
Everybody understands what a gate is, right?

279
00:15:30,673 --> 00:15:32,013
Open, close gate, audio gate, right?

280
00:15:34,355 --> 00:15:36,896
Now, when David was singing at the start of the song,

281
00:15:37,296 --> 00:15:38,917
and it was kind of low tones, there

282
00:15:38,957 --> 00:15:40,438
wasn't much volume to his voice.

283
00:15:40,858 --> 00:15:42,779
So this first microphone was all that was picking up.

284
00:15:44,174 --> 00:15:47,096
Then when he'd open up a little bit, the second microphone,

285
00:15:47,136 --> 00:15:49,278
the gate would open and allow some of his voice through.

286
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:51,640
That would create a bit of a natural ambience.

287
00:15:52,881 --> 00:15:55,023
Then when Bowie would really rip into it,

288
00:15:55,363 --> 00:15:57,565
the gate on the third microphone at the back would open up.

289
00:15:59,266 --> 00:16:01,147
And what I thought was really fascinating about this

290
00:16:01,908 --> 00:16:05,551
is that they designed a system that dynamically added

291
00:16:05,671 --> 00:16:07,953
reverb based on the input.

292
00:16:10,835 --> 00:16:12,736
So I thought, well, what if I designed a system

293
00:16:14,394 --> 00:16:17,476
that dynamically produced interesting and appropriate musical bits

294
00:16:18,797 --> 00:16:19,638
based on the input.

295
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:25,983
To be inspired by this, I started getting this awesome concept art through for the

296
00:16:26,003 --> 00:16:26,443
project.

297
00:16:27,263 --> 00:16:28,644
I was really fascinated by these

298
00:16:29,265 --> 00:16:32,948
concepts of where they had these giant rock structures that were being held

299
00:16:33,008 --> 00:16:33,688
together with this

300
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:36,290
evil force of energy, this hell energy.

301
00:16:37,415 --> 00:16:40,558
And the story in the game is that this evil corporation

302
00:16:40,978 --> 00:16:43,020
has found a way to mine this energy

303
00:16:43,621 --> 00:16:45,402
as a source of renewable energy, right?

304
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,623
Sustainable energy source.

305
00:16:47,604 --> 00:16:49,026
But I kind of love this idea

306
00:16:49,366 --> 00:16:51,107
that everything from your mobile phone

307
00:16:51,628 --> 00:16:52,809
to the TV you watch,

308
00:16:53,270 --> 00:16:54,971
to the pacemaker that's keeping you alive,

309
00:16:55,311 --> 00:16:56,533
to the plane that you're flying,

310
00:16:57,253 --> 00:17:00,056
is all being powered by energy mined from hell.

311
00:17:00,736 --> 00:17:02,018
It's kind of evil energy, right?

312
00:17:03,233 --> 00:17:08,535
I had this idea about this sort of force that was traveling through things and getting corrupted,

313
00:17:09,135 --> 00:17:09,975
this evil energy.

314
00:17:11,515 --> 00:17:14,956
So with that in mind, I set out to design the following system.

315
00:17:18,457 --> 00:17:23,678
Now for the sake of this next bit, I want you to think of audio like water.

316
00:17:24,938 --> 00:17:26,339
It flows downhill.

317
00:17:28,479 --> 00:17:29,920
We start with a computer at the top.

318
00:17:31,445 --> 00:17:33,206
The computer is what generates the sound.

319
00:17:33,406 --> 00:17:35,767
In this case, it was a simple sine wave.

320
00:17:36,187 --> 00:17:37,708
We'll go into more of that in a little bit.

321
00:17:39,408 --> 00:17:41,789
That computer split that signal out

322
00:17:41,809 --> 00:17:43,250
into four different paths.

323
00:17:44,570 --> 00:17:46,551
These paths went into a chain.

324
00:17:47,931 --> 00:17:51,232
The first chain consisted of a whole bunch of pedals,

325
00:17:51,813 --> 00:17:52,773
four pedals as a result.

326
00:17:53,213 --> 00:17:55,174
Now, for this first test, I actually wrote these down

327
00:17:55,214 --> 00:17:57,095
for the real geeks in the audience, if you're curious.

328
00:17:58,354 --> 00:18:02,337
So the first pedal there was a Retro Mechanical Labs 432K

329
00:18:02,357 --> 00:18:04,439
distortion box, really, really great distortion box.

330
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,782
The second pedal was a Metasonix KV100,

331
00:18:08,122 --> 00:18:09,583
really interesting tube distortion.

332
00:18:10,784 --> 00:18:12,346
The third pedal was a Geiger counter,

333
00:18:12,366 --> 00:18:13,907
it's like a bit crusher that you can kind of do

334
00:18:13,947 --> 00:18:14,768
some cool stuff with.

335
00:18:15,508 --> 00:18:17,971
The fourth pedal was a DwarfCraft fuzz

336
00:18:18,051 --> 00:18:19,892
from the DwarfCraft devices guys,

337
00:18:19,912 --> 00:18:20,933
they're really, really cool as well.

338
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:22,855
That was the first chain.

339
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:24,876
At the bottom of that was a splitter,

340
00:18:24,977 --> 00:18:26,178
we'll get back to that one in a second.

341
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,069
The second chain went through a very similar setup.

342
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:31,330
We had another four pedals.

343
00:18:31,390 --> 00:18:33,311
The first one was another Geiger counter,

344
00:18:33,431 --> 00:18:34,112
just for awesomeness.

345
00:18:34,953 --> 00:18:37,034
The second one was a Metasonic's TX3.

346
00:18:37,235 --> 00:18:38,015
Google it or don't.

347
00:18:39,436 --> 00:18:41,098
The third was a Mutron Bi-Phase,

348
00:18:41,138 --> 00:18:44,581
an old phaser from like the late 60s, early 70s,

349
00:18:44,661 --> 00:18:45,702
really, really old phaser pedal.

350
00:18:45,722 --> 00:18:48,284
And because I really liked old phaser pedals,

351
00:18:48,304 --> 00:18:49,305
there was a second one of those.

352
00:18:49,385 --> 00:18:51,066
It was a Dodd 70s phaser as well.

353
00:18:51,787 --> 00:18:52,667
So really, really cool stuff.

354
00:18:54,129 --> 00:18:55,310
At the end of that was a compressor.

355
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:56,711
We'll come back to that one in a second.

356
00:18:57,849 --> 00:18:59,952
The third chain consisted of a tape echo.

357
00:18:59,972 --> 00:19:03,077
I had this Watkins Copycat old tape echo.

358
00:19:03,377 --> 00:19:04,979
They would actually record to a tape,

359
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,183
and then the record head is back with the play head,

360
00:19:07,243 --> 00:19:08,885
so whatever you record plays up behind.

361
00:19:08,925 --> 00:19:10,888
And that's like proper echo, actual natural echo

362
00:19:10,909 --> 00:19:12,271
when they're on a tape machine, right?

363
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:12,711
Real stuff.

364
00:19:14,005 --> 00:19:18,266
The second distortion box that was under that, the pedal one that you see listed there on the third chain,

365
00:19:18,286 --> 00:19:21,967
that was just another distortion box, it was a Trogatronic valve distortion thing.

366
00:19:22,567 --> 00:19:26,428
It wasn't really there for the distortion aspect, it was there more for the compression aspect.

367
00:19:27,168 --> 00:19:31,129
After that I had this old Akai reel-to-reel machine from the 70s.

368
00:19:32,149 --> 00:19:35,310
It's like a tiny little quarter inch thing, great sound, really really grimy.

369
00:19:36,010 --> 00:19:39,451
What I was doing here was feeding it with about 40 decibels more than it could handle,

370
00:19:39,811 --> 00:19:43,251
which was really really cool, and then recording back off it at the same time.

371
00:19:44,132 --> 00:19:48,500
Following on to that, that went into a spring reverb tank with a wet and dry control so

372
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:49,823
I could kind of play around with that.

373
00:19:50,224 --> 00:19:52,307
That went into a compressor, which I'll talk about in a second.

374
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,751
The final one we did a couple of different interesting things with.

375
00:19:56,131 --> 00:19:57,972
The signal was sent out to a little mini amp.

376
00:19:57,992 --> 00:20:00,092
You know those little crappy Fender mini amp things

377
00:20:00,112 --> 00:20:01,473
that got a tiny little speaker in them?

378
00:20:02,873 --> 00:20:04,894
Again, it was being fed with about 40 decibels too much

379
00:20:04,914 --> 00:20:05,634
of what it can handle.

380
00:20:07,135 --> 00:20:10,836
That was being mic'd with a little microphone.

381
00:20:11,036 --> 00:20:13,636
So the speaker had a microphone in front of it.

382
00:20:13,937 --> 00:20:15,477
And a little bit of that signal was

383
00:20:15,497 --> 00:20:18,278
being sent through a splitter back into the amp itself.

384
00:20:18,338 --> 00:20:19,938
So we're creating a feedback loop there.

385
00:20:21,208 --> 00:20:23,369
But the feedback loop was only very, very small.

386
00:20:23,409 --> 00:20:25,790
It was so small that if a sound was actually

387
00:20:25,830 --> 00:20:28,172
coming through the amp, it would choke out the feedback.

388
00:20:28,592 --> 00:20:30,513
And when that sound started to disappear,

389
00:20:30,773 --> 00:20:32,554
the feedback would come back up in the mix.

390
00:20:32,954 --> 00:20:34,475
I have a little example of that running here.

391
00:20:41,959 --> 00:20:43,820
So we can hear whenever that distortion sort of stuff

392
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:45,581
starts to die out, the feedback comes in, right?

393
00:20:47,762 --> 00:20:50,484
So the next thing is that every single one of those

394
00:20:50,564 --> 00:20:53,426
ran into a mixer, so I can start summing things back down.

395
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:56,269
That ran into an EQ and a compressor.

396
00:20:56,589 --> 00:20:58,130
The EQ wasn't really doing much.

397
00:20:58,170 --> 00:21:00,632
It was adding about four or five decibels down really low,

398
00:21:00,672 --> 00:21:01,974
about 30 to 60 hertz.

399
00:21:02,374 --> 00:21:04,636
And then we're adding about the same up, about sort of 8 to 10,

400
00:21:05,096 --> 00:21:07,518
basically creating a nice sort of smiley face EQ.

401
00:21:07,578 --> 00:21:08,699
Nothing really amazing there.

402
00:21:09,680 --> 00:21:11,101
That was running into a compressor.

403
00:21:11,361 --> 00:21:13,443
This compressor was absolutely friggin' pinned.

404
00:21:13,963 --> 00:21:15,944
I'm kidding, it was knocking off about 20 decibels.

405
00:21:17,065 --> 00:21:19,027
The reason I was hitting it that hard

406
00:21:19,467 --> 00:21:23,130
was so when the loud noises would start to go away,

407
00:21:23,530 --> 00:21:25,251
the compressor would begin to open up

408
00:21:25,571 --> 00:21:27,653
and bring up all the interesting noise

409
00:21:28,153 --> 00:21:30,635
that every single one of these pedals and bits of equipment was creating.

410
00:21:30,935 --> 00:21:32,977
I'll show you more of that in a second, that's very important.

411
00:21:33,577 --> 00:21:36,359
The compressor itself was set at about a 30 millisecond attack,

412
00:21:36,639 --> 00:21:38,060
so we got some really cool punchy stuff.

413
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,901
And then I'd adjust the release based

414
00:21:39,941 --> 00:21:41,622
on the tempo of whatever I was sending through it.

415
00:21:41,942 --> 00:21:43,543
Again, I'll show you that more in a second.

416
00:21:44,164 --> 00:21:45,945
The ratio was about 12 or 20 to 1.

417
00:21:46,045 --> 00:21:47,305
Pretty, pretty, pretty drastic.

418
00:21:47,386 --> 00:21:47,866
Pretty crazy.

419
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:51,808
And that was running straight into the digital audio workstation

420
00:21:51,848 --> 00:21:52,689
there and recording stuff.

421
00:21:53,249 --> 00:21:55,530
So what I'm going to do next is attempt

422
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:58,172
to, if we can get some volume on the computer here,

423
00:21:59,308 --> 00:22:04,611
I'm going to show you my first experiment running through this array.

424
00:22:05,552 --> 00:22:09,093
I'm going to show you a series of sub sine wave tones.

425
00:22:09,774 --> 00:22:12,855
They're four F notes followed by a little bit of a gap.

426
00:22:28,955 --> 00:22:29,995
Okay, so that's it.

427
00:22:30,055 --> 00:22:30,796
Now I know what you're thinking,

428
00:22:30,836 --> 00:22:31,796
it's really not amazing, right?

429
00:22:31,836 --> 00:22:33,257
I know, music of the year right here, woo!

430
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:40,982
But when you run that through this array,

431
00:22:41,982 --> 00:22:44,223
all sorts of interesting stuff starts to happen.

432
00:22:46,345 --> 00:22:48,446
What I want you to listen out for is a couple of things.

433
00:22:49,727 --> 00:22:51,708
At the end of those four F notes,

434
00:22:52,008 --> 00:22:53,989
you'll hear another note creep in underneath.

435
00:22:54,770 --> 00:22:56,651
It's like an E, it's like just below the F.

436
00:22:57,527 --> 00:23:00,569
That's not being generated from me, that's not being generated from the computer,

437
00:23:00,849 --> 00:23:03,091
that's coming from some ground hum within the array.

438
00:23:04,132 --> 00:23:07,974
Additional to that, there's all sorts of interesting distortion layers that are coming in and out

439
00:23:08,695 --> 00:23:10,916
based on that splitter on the left-hand side there

440
00:23:11,277 --> 00:23:13,858
that was sending a signal to those compressors along the bottom.

441
00:23:15,099 --> 00:23:20,183
Sometimes, if I wanted to, that was essentially sidechaining the signal from those other chains.

442
00:23:21,237 --> 00:23:25,359
So based on whatever the input was doing,

443
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:29,863
it could dynamically change the mix of each chain I had.

444
00:23:32,324 --> 00:23:33,385
The last thing I want you to hear out

445
00:23:33,405 --> 00:23:34,646
for is all sorts of interesting stuff

446
00:23:34,666 --> 00:23:36,027
that's going on with the sonics and things.

447
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:37,268
You'll hear all sorts of harmonics.

448
00:23:38,028 --> 00:23:41,391
Anyway, here again is that same subwoofer tone run

449
00:23:41,411 --> 00:23:42,751
through this array several times.

450
00:24:31,584 --> 00:24:33,245
Now we're getting somewhere interesting.

451
00:24:33,265 --> 00:24:40,731
So the way I started thinking about this

452
00:24:41,231 --> 00:24:42,792
was that this was my instrument.

453
00:24:44,193 --> 00:24:46,314
I'm feeding it a very basic input,

454
00:24:47,295 --> 00:24:49,216
and all I'm changing from that input

455
00:24:49,617 --> 00:24:52,459
is amplitude and pitch of what I'm sending through.

456
00:24:53,339 --> 00:24:55,401
Everything I was sending through, it was a sine wave.

457
00:24:55,861 --> 00:24:56,341
That's it.

458
00:24:57,975 --> 00:25:00,697
The reason I chose a sine wave is because a sine wave

459
00:25:00,797 --> 00:25:03,960
is our most pure representation of what sound can be.

460
00:25:05,362 --> 00:25:06,843
It's simply a wave that goes up

461
00:25:07,263 --> 00:25:08,464
and a wave that comes back down.

462
00:25:09,846 --> 00:25:12,588
Therefore, any interesting thing that was happening

463
00:25:12,648 --> 00:25:16,892
within this array was being imparted onto that sine wave

464
00:25:17,293 --> 00:25:18,714
in the purest form possible.

465
00:25:19,595 --> 00:25:22,337
I started to think about this as my doom instrument.

466
00:25:23,465 --> 00:25:25,587
Now, don't care too much about this sort of thing.

467
00:25:25,627 --> 00:25:26,588
These pedals would change.

468
00:25:26,628 --> 00:25:28,289
I'd swap stuff out and all that sort of thing.

469
00:25:28,529 --> 00:25:29,990
But the concept remained the same.

470
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,372
I'm going to show you a couple more examples of what

471
00:25:32,392 --> 00:25:33,233
I ran through it next.

472
00:25:33,793 --> 00:25:35,415
Here's another little sub part I ran through.

473
00:25:35,455 --> 00:25:36,275
I hope you guys can hear it.

474
00:25:40,258 --> 00:25:40,659
That's it.

475
00:25:40,899 --> 00:25:41,800
Very, very interesting.

476
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:42,180
Not really.

477
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:42,760
Kind of sucks.

478
00:25:43,121 --> 00:25:44,742
Here it is run through that array.

479
00:25:45,142 --> 00:25:47,144
All I'm doing is changing the amplitude

480
00:25:47,364 --> 00:25:49,065
and then tweaking some of the knobs as I go.

481
00:26:16,815 --> 00:26:17,776
Here's another example.

482
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:18,896
This is the same sort of thing.

483
00:26:18,916 --> 00:26:22,419
So I'll just play that one again.

484
00:26:22,439 --> 00:26:27,804
So it's da-da-dun, da-da-dun, da-da-dun, da-da-dun.

485
00:26:27,884 --> 00:26:28,725
Pretty basic, right?

486
00:26:29,345 --> 00:26:31,307
Now I'm going to play that one through this array again.

487
00:26:31,487 --> 00:26:33,689
You'll hear the rhythm change halfway through just

488
00:26:33,709 --> 00:26:35,791
because I was getting bored with the same da-da-dun, da-da-dun,

489
00:26:35,811 --> 00:26:36,651
da-da-dun over and over again.

490
00:27:24,428 --> 00:27:28,950
Again, everything there is being generated based on those sine waves alone.

491
00:27:30,191 --> 00:27:33,592
So here, finally, we're finding something that's interesting.

492
00:27:34,772 --> 00:27:37,613
This is some interesting music that is appropriate to Doom.

493
00:27:37,693 --> 00:27:38,814
It starts feeling good.

494
00:27:38,854 --> 00:27:42,195
When we started putting it into the game, it started working really, really quite well.

495
00:27:43,175 --> 00:27:47,217
But we only reached this thing because I changed the process.

496
00:27:48,177 --> 00:27:50,918
Changed the process, and we changed the outcome.

497
00:28:18,794 --> 00:28:21,317
So here we are, finally we had something interesting, right?

498
00:28:21,337 --> 00:28:22,959
Some really stuff that was kind of unique,

499
00:28:22,979 --> 00:28:23,960
it was kind of special to do,

500
00:28:23,980 --> 00:28:25,562
and it started feeling really, really good.

501
00:28:25,982 --> 00:28:26,803
Throwing it in the game,

502
00:28:26,863 --> 00:28:28,606
everybody was responding to it really well.

503
00:28:29,126 --> 00:28:30,248
We were really quite happy with it.

504
00:28:31,289 --> 00:28:34,533
The thing was though, it was missing something.

505
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:41,685
See, the modern Doom is nothing but a tribute to 90s game design.

506
00:28:42,345 --> 00:28:44,008
90s game design is really quite fascinating.

507
00:28:44,328 --> 00:28:46,191
You walk into a room and you're instantly

508
00:28:46,231 --> 00:28:48,874
presented with a series of very distinguishable enemies.

509
00:28:49,535 --> 00:28:52,519
It's your job, then, to figure out what weapon you want to pick

510
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:54,542
to be able to kind of get rid of those enemies.

511
00:28:55,162 --> 00:28:58,425
Now it's for that reason that you're allowed to carry as many weapons as you like.

512
00:28:58,785 --> 00:29:02,187
You don't need to aim down the sights, you're not hiding behind cover, none of this sort

513
00:29:02,227 --> 00:29:02,608
of stuff.

514
00:29:03,108 --> 00:29:05,990
The idea is that you're being constantly encouraged to move.

515
00:29:06,430 --> 00:29:07,171
It's very quick.

516
00:29:07,571 --> 00:29:08,672
It's very fast.

517
00:29:09,413 --> 00:29:13,115
In fact, even when you start to take health, you've got to go look for a health pack.

518
00:29:13,375 --> 00:29:15,297
You can't just hide somewhere and have it generate.

519
00:29:15,677 --> 00:29:17,699
It's all about kind of keeping that moving, right?

520
00:29:18,439 --> 00:29:22,161
Now I feel that what was really interesting about the Doom team on the new Doom

521
00:29:22,421 --> 00:29:25,082
was that we were really able to capture that 90s feeling

522
00:29:25,682 --> 00:29:28,043
even with a modern first-person shooter.

523
00:29:30,344 --> 00:29:32,445
When I visited the id Studios in Dallas,

524
00:29:32,665 --> 00:29:36,847
I was really blown away with how well the new Doom game actually felt.

525
00:29:37,348 --> 00:29:42,290
It was making me get these sort of weird nostalgic feelings of playing Doom back in the day.

526
00:29:42,310 --> 00:29:44,691
It was feeling very, very similar to the same thing.

527
00:29:45,919 --> 00:29:48,641
So the game itself there felt like Doom,

528
00:29:50,342 --> 00:29:52,523
but it wasn't sounding like Doom.

529
00:29:53,964 --> 00:29:55,305
And I knew exactly why.

530
00:30:01,449 --> 00:30:02,630
We had no guitars.

531
00:30:05,752 --> 00:30:07,793
Now, of course, there's a really good reason behind that, right?

532
00:30:08,153 --> 00:30:10,014
I mean, I know they said no guitars, we hate guitars,

533
00:30:10,034 --> 00:30:11,015
don't put guitars into a game.

534
00:30:11,055 --> 00:30:12,516
But I totally understood why.

535
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:13,436
Why?

536
00:30:15,123 --> 00:30:17,225
It's because the sound of an electric guitar

537
00:30:17,865 --> 00:30:20,827
somehow instantly summarizes a genre

538
00:30:21,547 --> 00:30:23,128
that has become a bit of a joke.

539
00:30:23,608 --> 00:30:25,149
So I'll pick one up when I go out today.

540
00:30:25,649 --> 00:30:27,050
Other than that, I'm a good chick.

541
00:30:55,240 --> 00:30:57,141
So I mean, you can instantly see why.

542
00:30:57,161 --> 00:31:00,905
No developer wants to be associated with such a joke, right?

543
00:31:00,985 --> 00:31:02,306
I mean, it totally makes sense.

544
00:31:03,587 --> 00:31:10,493
The thing is, though, that harsh, aggressive, up-front sound that you get from a guitar

545
00:31:11,374 --> 00:31:15,718
is exactly appropriate, and it was the thing that was missing from the soundtrack.

546
00:31:16,909 --> 00:31:19,370
Now it took some convincing, but after a while

547
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:21,630
we started looking at, hey, what happens

548
00:31:21,670 --> 00:31:24,191
if we add a little bit of guitar, like 5% here,

549
00:31:24,771 --> 00:31:26,331
and then maybe 10% here, right?

550
00:31:26,391 --> 00:31:27,311
Little bit by little bit.

551
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:28,592
No, slowly, slowly, slowly.

552
00:31:29,632 --> 00:31:31,792
What we wanted to do, though, was kind of experiment

553
00:31:31,832 --> 00:31:33,213
with different guitar tones.

554
00:31:33,733 --> 00:31:36,333
We didn't just want to take sort of general metal sounds

555
00:31:36,393 --> 00:31:37,694
and put those into the game, because it

556
00:31:37,734 --> 00:31:38,714
didn't feel appropriate.

557
00:31:38,994 --> 00:31:40,174
It kind of felt like that.

558
00:31:41,935 --> 00:31:43,615
So we started experimenting with different ways

559
00:31:43,655 --> 00:31:44,655
to get guitar tones.

560
00:31:46,798 --> 00:31:50,921
I was again inspired by the work that Chris Renner and things had done in the 90s and

561
00:31:50,941 --> 00:31:56,424
stuff like that and specifically Marilyn Manson and an engineer that Marilyn Manson worked

562
00:31:56,464 --> 00:31:57,505
with named Sean Bevan.

563
00:31:58,185 --> 00:32:03,209
And he had this brilliant technique back in the day of getting this really chunky guitar

564
00:32:03,249 --> 00:32:03,509
tone.

565
00:32:03,849 --> 00:32:07,111
And it was a guitar tone that they used for like beautiful people and stuff like that.

566
00:32:07,772 --> 00:32:11,814
And one of the methods they used to get that guitar tune was to take the guitar part as

567
00:32:11,874 --> 00:32:15,797
it normally was, play it up an octave and then twice as fast.

568
00:32:17,302 --> 00:32:20,805
And you'd record that to tape at 30 inches per second.

569
00:32:22,426 --> 00:32:24,268
Then you'd take that tape and slow it down

570
00:32:24,308 --> 00:32:26,970
to 15 inches per second and get some really interesting

571
00:32:27,010 --> 00:32:27,390
results.

572
00:32:28,591 --> 00:32:30,573
Now, I had a tape machine, and I wanted to give this a try.

573
00:32:31,213 --> 00:32:33,876
So this is the guitar part played up an octave twice

574
00:32:33,896 --> 00:32:34,376
as fast.

575
00:32:41,022 --> 00:32:42,423
Now, I know it sounds like Bill and Ted at the moment.

576
00:32:42,463 --> 00:32:42,843
Don't worry.

577
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:49,967
We record that to tape at 30 inches per second, play it back at 15 inches per second, run

578
00:32:50,007 --> 00:32:53,111
it through a preamp which is kind of jacked pretty hard, you get this.

579
00:33:00,239 --> 00:33:02,461
Pretty cool stuff, super super gnarly right?

580
00:33:04,740 --> 00:33:08,982
Another thing I did was started extending the range of the guitar down a lot.

581
00:33:09,342 --> 00:33:12,383
Now, I know a lot of people have made jokes about this sort of thing, and fair enough,

582
00:33:12,463 --> 00:33:12,683
too.

583
00:33:13,403 --> 00:33:15,384
I got a hold of a nine string, right?

584
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,345
Nine strings are really freaking crazy.

585
00:33:18,365 --> 00:33:19,485
You don't need a nine string.

586
00:33:19,545 --> 00:33:20,606
It's like excessiveness.

587
00:33:21,046 --> 00:33:25,347
A nine string is so low, it is literally like having a five string bass on the bottom of

588
00:33:25,387 --> 00:33:26,448
your regular guitar.

589
00:33:26,808 --> 00:33:27,748
It's kind of stupid.

590
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:34,030
I had this nine string riff for the main menu theme.

591
00:33:43,941 --> 00:33:46,461
The trouble was that it was sounding too much like a guitar.

592
00:33:46,481 --> 00:33:48,762
It was sounding again too much like a sort of metal thing.

593
00:33:49,102 --> 00:33:50,782
And as I said, the whole nine string thing,

594
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:52,903
yeah, really, really, really stupid.

595
00:33:53,283 --> 00:33:56,163
I actually got rid of the nine string after finishing up the Doom project.

596
00:33:56,203 --> 00:33:57,284
I gave it to a buddy of mine.

597
00:33:57,344 --> 00:34:01,124
He plays in like the biggest, most aggressive metal band in the world,

598
00:34:01,545 --> 00:34:03,185
and even he can't find a use for it.

599
00:34:05,785 --> 00:34:08,026
Around the time I was experimenting with this,

600
00:34:09,105 --> 00:34:14,088
The Zynaptic plugin people re-released a plugin called Morph.

601
00:34:15,188 --> 00:34:16,149
And it's a really cool plugin.

602
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:17,230
I recommend anybody check it out.

603
00:34:17,270 --> 00:34:19,311
Basically what you can do is take two sounds

604
00:34:20,231 --> 00:34:22,133
and interpolate some characteristics

605
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:23,493
of one sound into another.

606
00:34:23,914 --> 00:34:25,314
I don't know exactly how it works,

607
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,815
but basically you can take one sound

608
00:34:26,855 --> 00:34:28,937
and kind of start to morph it into the other sound.

609
00:34:30,518 --> 00:34:33,720
I took a sample of the chainsaw from the original Doom game.

610
00:34:35,508 --> 00:34:40,051
and started to interpolate that guitar tone with that chainsaw sound.

611
00:34:40,552 --> 00:34:41,713
And this is what we ended up with.

612
00:35:01,394 --> 00:35:03,235
Doom's kind of violent if I didn't make that point.

613
00:35:04,675 --> 00:35:05,995
Sorry, I should have pointed that out at the beginning.

614
00:35:07,656 --> 00:35:09,056
Anyway, so this was a really interesting way

615
00:35:09,076 --> 00:35:11,677
to start getting some unique guitar tones into the game.

616
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,697
Now, once I got this, I felt this

617
00:35:14,757 --> 00:35:17,018
was like the little Trojan horse that I

618
00:35:17,058 --> 00:35:19,679
was able to sneak into the id software bases, right?

619
00:35:20,339 --> 00:35:22,219
And once I was in there, I was able to put

620
00:35:22,259 --> 00:35:23,580
as much guitar in as I wanted.

621
00:35:26,679 --> 00:35:31,063
Interestingly, what that allowed us to do was do something that I really love doing

622
00:35:31,123 --> 00:35:32,304
on every single project.

623
00:35:32,865 --> 00:35:39,010
And that is to create a couple of songs that belong in the game that kind of become easily

624
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:40,632
identifiable to that game.

625
00:35:40,992 --> 00:35:42,373
It's a process I really enjoy doing.

626
00:35:42,613 --> 00:35:44,915
It's not just like the score stuff that sits in the background,

627
00:35:45,235 --> 00:35:47,957
but it's these songs that fans seem to really enjoy.

628
00:35:47,997 --> 00:35:49,198
It's the ones that they point out with.

629
00:35:49,258 --> 00:35:51,659
It's the songs that become associated with the game in the end.

630
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:54,561
So once we started doing this guitar thing,

631
00:35:54,901 --> 00:35:56,282
it allowed us to do this.

632
00:35:56,342 --> 00:35:58,063
It allowed us to get these songs in there.

633
00:35:58,384 --> 00:36:00,625
It was finally starting to feel like a Doom game,

634
00:36:00,885 --> 00:36:03,487
and not so much just like some nerdy, geeky synth-fest.

635
00:36:19,370 --> 00:36:21,772
So all of a sudden, just by adding that stuff in there,

636
00:36:22,073 --> 00:36:24,114
it started to feel like a Doom game.

637
00:36:24,815 --> 00:36:27,978
It started to make the player run around the arena a little bit

638
00:36:28,018 --> 00:36:29,920
more and feel comfortable doing that.

639
00:36:31,201 --> 00:36:32,962
Also, what was really funny about that

640
00:36:33,423 --> 00:36:36,045
is that once the game came out, fans of the game

641
00:36:36,325 --> 00:36:37,746
started to make jokes about the song.

642
00:37:08,311 --> 00:37:09,051
So there we go.

643
00:37:10,472 --> 00:37:13,694
By changing our process, we changed the outcome.

644
00:37:14,414 --> 00:37:17,436
We were able to come up with some sounds that fit the game.

645
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:19,277
I would argue that it's not stuff

646
00:37:19,317 --> 00:37:21,178
that nobody's ever heard before, but it

647
00:37:21,218 --> 00:37:23,800
was something that started to become quite unique for Doom.

648
00:37:25,057 --> 00:37:26,177
It fit the project.

649
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:28,798
By adding a bit of guitar and stuff in there,

650
00:37:28,878 --> 00:37:30,999
it started to fit the project even further.

651
00:37:31,759 --> 00:37:33,619
Even that was in the brief as a no-no,

652
00:37:34,139 --> 00:37:36,520
we decided to go back and change that brief

653
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:39,440
in order to better kind of access that other point

654
00:37:39,480 --> 00:37:40,301
that was in the brief,

655
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,521
which was that it needs to be instantly loved

656
00:37:43,581 --> 00:37:46,022
by all the Doom fans out in the world, right?

657
00:37:47,242 --> 00:37:48,082
So here's where we are.

658
00:37:48,102 --> 00:37:49,783
This is how we started interpreting that brief.

659
00:37:53,043 --> 00:37:57,764
Now on Doom, it's impossible to ignore the controversy that the original Doom caused

660
00:37:57,804 --> 00:37:59,625
when it first came out back in the 90s.

661
00:38:01,225 --> 00:38:03,706
But music has had its fair share of controversy as well.

662
00:38:04,406 --> 00:38:09,827
In May of 1982, teenagers of a congregation in Topeka, Kansas, destroyed thousands of

663
00:38:09,887 --> 00:38:14,108
dollars worth of records and tapes which, they felt, contained the message of Satan.

664
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:20,109
I think that within the rock music field, you've got people who really are into the

665
00:38:20,249 --> 00:38:21,629
occult and into Satan.

666
00:38:22,432 --> 00:38:27,755
They're propagating Satan, they're propagating the demonic line, the occultic world.

667
00:38:27,835 --> 00:38:30,176
And I think it's a devastating thing on our culture. ♪♪♪

678
00:38:45,062 --> 00:38:48,043
One day, I was working on this bass part.

679
00:38:51,743 --> 00:38:59,425
Three notes, repeat. Pretty basic stuff, kind of bored with it. I was looking for

680
00:38:59,485 --> 00:39:04,686
something that needed to make this thing interesting. Is Satan rampant in rock? To

681
00:39:04,726 --> 00:39:09,207
some, the answer is obvious. Skull-headed monsters and demon-like

682
00:39:09,267 --> 00:39:14,908
figures are probably the most blatant. And there is the number 666, also known

683
00:39:14,948 --> 00:39:18,809
as the mark of the beast, the symbol belonging to the Antichrist, who the

684
00:39:18,869 --> 00:39:20,489
Bible tells us is Satan.

685
00:39:23,239 --> 00:39:26,600
I'm a moth, and that's a really big fucking flame.

686
00:39:32,121 --> 00:39:34,041
I was playing around with one of my favorite synths called

687
00:39:34,101 --> 00:39:34,481
Harmor.

688
00:39:34,521 --> 00:39:35,421
It's made by ImageLine.

689
00:39:36,942 --> 00:39:38,942
And one of my favorite little things with Harmor is that you

690
00:39:38,962 --> 00:39:41,843
can take an image, any image, load it into the synthesizer,

691
00:39:42,503 --> 00:39:45,223
and it starts to generate characteristics of that image

692
00:39:45,483 --> 00:39:46,644
across the frequency spectrum.

693
00:39:47,084 --> 00:39:50,944
So essentially what you're able to do is insert an image into

694
00:39:50,964 --> 00:39:51,785
a WAV file.

695
00:39:52,825 --> 00:39:54,727
but you need a spectrograph to be able to see it, right?

696
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:58,249
So I found this picture of the number six,

697
00:39:59,570 --> 00:40:01,591
and I poured it over the bass part.

698
00:40:12,198 --> 00:40:15,220
I don't know if you've noticed, but there's

699
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:16,301
a big problem with that there.

700
00:40:16,321 --> 00:40:19,743
Is that we've got this big, giant gap in the middle.

701
00:40:21,968 --> 00:40:26,131
So I grabbed Hama again, and I made another interesting base

702
00:40:27,052 --> 00:40:29,013
using this really interesting image I found

703
00:40:29,073 --> 00:40:30,494
on the internet of a star.

704
00:40:31,095 --> 00:40:32,015
It was kind of upside down.

705
00:40:45,004 --> 00:40:47,125
Now, at this point, I'm giggling like a child.

706
00:40:49,782 --> 00:40:51,902
So much so that Jess, my wife, actually heard the giggling.

707
00:40:51,922 --> 00:40:53,303
She came in and she said, what on earth are you doing?

708
00:40:53,563 --> 00:40:54,564
And she snapped me at this moment

709
00:40:54,584 --> 00:40:56,524
where I had this really childish kind of look at my face.

710
00:40:56,544 --> 00:41:02,927
Now, of course, it's a bit of fun, right?

711
00:41:02,947 --> 00:41:03,987
You've got to have fun on these projects.

712
00:41:04,948 --> 00:41:05,368
But don't worry.

713
00:41:05,468 --> 00:41:07,649
I did the thing that any responsible composer would do.

714
00:41:09,470 --> 00:41:10,030
I saved it.

715
00:41:11,430 --> 00:41:12,331
I put it into Wwise.

716
00:41:13,811 --> 00:41:14,812
I put it into the game.

717
00:41:16,752 --> 00:41:17,453
And I sent it off.

718
00:41:22,194 --> 00:41:23,755
and I didn't tell anybody about it.

719
00:41:28,276 --> 00:41:29,417
What's the worst that can happen, right?

720
00:41:29,457 --> 00:41:31,098
I mean, for anybody to see that,

721
00:41:31,678 --> 00:41:33,038
they'd have to crack open the game,

722
00:41:33,719 --> 00:41:34,959
pull out the Y's files,

723
00:41:35,599 --> 00:41:37,820
and run every single file through a spectrograph,

724
00:41:38,220 --> 00:41:39,961
and find that single base part.

725
00:41:40,401 --> 00:41:41,321
It's never going to happen, right?

726
00:41:54,166 --> 00:41:58,989
So it doesn't get any clearer than that, with all the pentagrams and the 666 right there.

727
00:41:59,049 --> 00:42:04,552
They're letting you know, here's our allegiance to Satan, and your children are listening to this.

728
00:42:15,498 --> 00:42:16,318
But wait, there's more.

729
00:42:18,880 --> 00:42:20,381
I was working on this drone sound.

730
00:42:37,677 --> 00:42:40,119
Pretty, pretty horrible, pretty nasty drone sound.

731
00:42:40,780 --> 00:42:43,222
Now if anybody's curious, the way I made this drone sound

732
00:42:43,862 --> 00:42:44,863
was by bowed guitar.

733
00:42:44,903 --> 00:42:46,545
Everything you're hearing there is bowed guitar.

734
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:50,388
I'm bowing a guitar between C, sorry, C sharp and D,

735
00:42:51,028 --> 00:42:53,110
and I've spread that out across four octaves,

736
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,932
and all I'm doing is just slowly bowing

737
00:42:54,972 --> 00:42:56,653
between those two notes, and I recorded that

738
00:42:56,933 --> 00:42:57,934
a whole bunch of different times

739
00:42:57,974 --> 00:42:59,015
and layered it on top of each other.

740
00:42:59,035 --> 00:43:00,737
And when you do that, that's the kind of sound you get.

741
00:43:00,757 --> 00:43:01,757
It's really, really quite a cool thing.

742
00:43:02,238 --> 00:43:03,999
Again, it's kind of using guitars in an interesting way

743
00:43:04,019 --> 00:43:04,960
to get that horror thing across.

744
00:43:06,682 --> 00:43:09,665
Now I had this idea one day that I wonder if I can hide

745
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:11,907
a message in there somehow.

746
00:43:13,709 --> 00:43:16,431
What happens if I put something in the center

747
00:43:19,694 --> 00:43:21,315
and then took a little bit of information

748
00:43:21,375 --> 00:43:22,757
from one side of the channel

749
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,559
and put that into the other side of the channel

750
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,521
and then flip the phase?

751
00:43:27,541 --> 00:43:32,345
Then what happens if somebody listens back to that in mono,

752
00:43:32,365 --> 00:43:33,506
they get this.

753
00:43:45,863 --> 00:43:50,466
So literally there, that's exactly the same sound I just played before, but played back in mono.

754
00:43:51,627 --> 00:43:52,588
And what's that all about?

755
00:43:55,070 --> 00:43:59,714
Government investigation has found subliminal messages on certain albums when played in reverse.

756
00:44:01,395 --> 00:44:01,515
Ah.

757
00:44:02,756 --> 00:44:04,678
So what happens if we play that in reverse?

758
00:44:29,187 --> 00:44:31,449
Now, do you know how many news websites wrote about that one?

759
00:44:31,469 --> 00:44:33,691
Freaking none!

760
00:44:38,635 --> 00:44:39,616
So, what did we learn on doom?

761
00:44:39,756 --> 00:44:46,703
Well, if you want to get a different outcome, you must change the process.

762
00:44:47,563 --> 00:44:50,326
Change the process, change the outcome.

763
00:44:51,182 --> 00:44:53,524
If you're struggling to come up with something new,

764
00:44:54,144 --> 00:44:55,986
if you find yourself stuck in a rut,

765
00:44:56,566 --> 00:44:58,448
if you're suffering from creative blocks,

766
00:44:59,249 --> 00:45:00,650
change the process.

767
00:45:01,390 --> 00:45:03,172
Change the way you're doing things

768
00:45:03,292 --> 00:45:05,154
and you'll end up with a different result.

769
00:45:06,055 --> 00:45:09,578
Not only that, but have the courage to do so.

770
00:45:10,638 --> 00:45:12,600
I say courage, not confidence.

771
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:16,143
Confidence comes from doing the same thing

772
00:45:16,403 --> 00:45:18,725
over and over and over and over again.

773
00:45:19,768 --> 00:45:21,649
It takes courage to change that.

774
00:45:23,670 --> 00:45:26,112
The second thing we learned, change the brief

775
00:45:26,272 --> 00:45:28,173
if it makes the project better.

776
00:45:29,514 --> 00:45:31,435
Even though the brief said no guitars

777
00:45:31,555 --> 00:45:33,556
and we went down that route to begin with,

778
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:37,038
we felt comfortable changing that later on

779
00:45:37,098 --> 00:45:40,340
to satisfy a more important element of that brief.

780
00:45:41,381 --> 00:45:42,882
Sometimes you cannot do everything.

781
00:45:44,129 --> 00:45:48,230
That being said though, I feel we reached a more interesting place

782
00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:54,211
by ignoring the guitar element that was so synonymous with the Doom universe to begin with.

783
00:45:55,151 --> 00:45:57,412
I feel if we started with guitars in mind,

784
00:45:57,912 --> 00:46:01,192
we would have ended up with something that sounded like those memes I was playing before.

785
00:46:01,212 --> 00:46:04,693
And finally, and the most important,

786
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:11,014
a team that encourages an environment where you feel comfortable in failure

787
00:46:11,654 --> 00:46:13,655
will enable you to thrive.

788
00:46:15,455 --> 00:46:20,540
As a composer on the project, your fear of rejection will often get in the way of you

789
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,523
experimenting and pushing the boundaries a little bit more.

790
00:46:24,204 --> 00:46:25,345
And that's understandable.

791
00:46:26,005 --> 00:46:29,148
Sometimes you're working with somebody who is not encouraging that.

792
00:46:30,670 --> 00:46:35,334
And we say whenever you're on a project, you're playing one part as the provider of the music

793
00:46:36,615 --> 00:46:39,078
and one part as the educator of music.

794
00:46:40,383 --> 00:46:44,628
try and educate your other team members above, below, and on the same level,

795
00:46:45,328 --> 00:46:49,553
then an environment in which you're encouraged to fail and feel fine failing

796
00:46:50,034 --> 00:46:52,416
is something that will allow you to thrive.

797
00:47:34,286 --> 00:47:34,727
Thank you everybody.

798
00:47:34,747 --> 00:47:34,827
Yeah!

799
00:47:34,847 --> 00:47:34,927
Whoo!

800
00:47:34,947 --> 00:47:35,007
Woo!

801
00:47:35,027 --> 00:47:35,127
Yes!

802
00:47:35,187 --> 00:47:35,247
Yes!

803
00:47:35,267 --> 00:47:35,328
Woo!

804
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:35,428
Yeah!

805
00:47:35,448 --> 00:47:35,508
Yes!

806
00:47:35,528 --> 00:47:35,588
Woo!

807
00:47:35,608 --> 00:47:35,668
Yes!

808
00:47:35,688 --> 00:47:35,748
Woo!

809
00:47:35,768 --> 00:47:35,828
Yes!

810
00:47:35,848 --> 00:47:35,928
Woo!

811
00:47:35,948 --> 00:47:36,008
Woo!

812
00:47:36,029 --> 00:47:36,089
Woo!

813
00:47:36,109 --> 00:47:36,169
Woo!

814
00:47:36,189 --> 00:47:36,249
Woo!

815
00:47:36,269 --> 00:47:36,329
Woo!

816
00:47:36,349 --> 00:47:36,409
Woo!

817
00:47:36,429 --> 00:47:36,489
Woo!

818
00:47:36,509 --> 00:47:36,569
Woo!

819
00:47:36,589 --> 00:47:36,649
Woo!

820
00:47:36,669 --> 00:47:36,730
Woo!

821
00:47:36,750 --> 00:47:36,810
Woo!

822
00:47:36,830 --> 00:47:36,890
Yes!

823
00:47:36,910 --> 00:47:36,990
Yeah!

824
00:47:37,010 --> 00:47:37,070
Woo!

825
00:47:37,090 --> 00:47:37,150
Woo!

826
00:47:37,170 --> 00:47:37,230
Woo!

827
00:47:37,250 --> 00:47:37,310
Woo!

828
00:47:37,330 --> 00:47:37,390
Woo!

829
00:47:37,411 --> 00:47:37,471
Woo!

830
00:47:37,491 --> 00:47:37,571
Woo!

831
00:47:37,591 --> 00:47:37,651
Woo!

832
00:47:37,671 --> 00:47:37,731
Woo!

833
00:47:37,751 --> 00:47:37,831
Woo!

834
00:47:37,851 --> 00:47:37,911
Woo!

835
00:47:37,931 --> 00:47:37,991
Woo!

836
00:47:38,011 --> 00:47:38,071
Woo!

837
00:47:38,092 --> 00:47:38,152
Woo!

838
00:47:38,172 --> 00:47:38,232
Woo!

839
00:47:38,252 --> 00:47:38,312
Woo!

840
00:47:38,332 --> 00:47:38,392
Woo!

841
00:47:38,412 --> 00:47:38,472
Woo!

842
00:47:38,492 --> 00:47:38,552
Woo!

843
00:47:38,572 --> 00:47:38,632
Woo!

844
00:47:38,652 --> 00:47:38,712
Woo!

845
00:47:38,732 --> 00:47:38,793
Woo!

846
00:47:38,813 --> 00:47:38,873
Woo!

847
00:47:38,893 --> 00:47:38,953
Woo!

848
00:47:38,973 --> 00:47:39,033
Woo!

849
00:47:39,053 --> 00:47:39,113
Woo!

850
00:47:39,133 --> 00:47:39,193
Woo!

851
00:47:39,213 --> 00:47:39,273
Woo!

852
00:47:39,293 --> 00:47:39,353
Woo!

853
00:47:39,373 --> 00:47:39,433
Woo!

854
00:47:39,453 --> 00:47:39,514
Woo!

855
00:47:39,534 --> 00:47:39,614
Yeah!

856
00:47:39,634 --> 00:47:39,694
Woo!

857
00:47:39,714 --> 00:47:39,774
Woo!

858
00:47:39,794 --> 00:47:39,854
Woo!

859
00:47:39,874 --> 00:47:39,934
Woo!

860
00:47:39,954 --> 00:47:40,014
Woo!

861
00:47:40,034 --> 00:47:40,094
Woo!

862
00:47:40,114 --> 00:47:40,175
Woo!

863
00:47:40,195 --> 00:47:40,255
Woo!

864
00:47:40,275 --> 00:47:40,335
Woo!

865
00:47:40,355 --> 00:47:40,415
Woo!

866
00:47:40,435 --> 00:47:40,495
Woo!

867
00:47:40,515 --> 00:47:40,575
Woo!

868
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:40,655
Woo!

869
00:47:40,675 --> 00:47:40,735
Woo!

870

So ladies and gentlemen, we've got about 10 to 15 minutes for a bunch of questions.

907
00:47:58,762 --> 00:48:00,924
I really encourage anybody who wants to ask a question,

908
00:48:01,204 --> 00:48:04,366
just jump straight up to that microphone there and let's get into it.

909
00:48:04,706 --> 00:48:04,986
Yo.

910
00:48:05,606 --> 00:48:05,867
Hello.

911
00:48:06,427 --> 00:48:06,747
Hey, man.

912
00:48:07,047 --> 00:48:08,288
This is brilliant, by the way.

913
00:48:08,388 --> 00:48:08,708
Thank you.

914
00:48:10,530 --> 00:48:14,472
One of my favorite things about your music, both in Doom and in Killer Instinct,

915
00:48:14,592 --> 00:48:18,615
is how it's integrated to kind of respond to player actions and player input.

916
00:48:19,649 --> 00:48:23,992
Like in Doom, the glory kills cause some of your music to muffle and distort.

917
00:48:24,352 --> 00:48:31,117
And then in Killer Instinct, you've got those ultra combos that completely changes the music in real time.

918
00:48:31,137 --> 00:48:33,478
And I'm curious, do you have a hand in some of that integration?

919
00:48:33,498 --> 00:48:37,822
And can you talk a little bit about the differences between this project and Killer Instinct?

920
00:48:38,042 --> 00:48:39,182
Yeah, sure, absolutely.

921
00:48:39,242 --> 00:48:40,123
Really, really good question.

922
00:48:40,924 --> 00:48:42,645
The reason I chose not to go too much

923
00:48:42,685 --> 00:48:44,566
into the implementation side of things on Doom

924
00:48:44,806 --> 00:48:46,767
is that there's a lot of questions and things here

925
00:48:46,827 --> 00:48:48,388
that usually happens at GDC about this,

926
00:48:48,408 --> 00:48:49,849
which allows me to answer those sort of things.

927
00:48:50,110 --> 00:48:51,290
But not only that, there's a lot of talks

928
00:48:51,310 --> 00:48:53,572
that go into the implementation side of it as well.

929
00:48:54,332 --> 00:48:56,113
And I found that there was some really important lessons

930
00:48:56,133 --> 00:48:57,935
that I learned on the Doom score,

931
00:48:58,015 --> 00:49:00,076
such as the team that really encourages an environment

932
00:49:00,096 --> 00:49:01,337
where you feel comfortable in failing,

933
00:49:01,557 --> 00:49:02,498
that were really important,

934
00:49:02,518 --> 00:49:03,979
that you don't really see discussed in.

935
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,523
at GDC. So thanks so much for answering this question.

936
00:49:08,224 --> 00:49:10,668
Essentially the biggest difference between Killer Instinct and Doom is

937
00:49:10,688 --> 00:49:11,929
obviously the style of the game.

938
00:49:12,230 --> 00:49:14,954
Killer Instinct has a very predictable structure where you're going to have a

939
00:49:14,994 --> 00:49:18,038
first round, a second round, you know there's kills at the end, there's combos that can

940
00:49:18,078 --> 00:49:18,299
happen.

941
00:49:18,539 --> 00:49:20,361
There's this kind of framework that you're working within.

942
00:49:21,062 --> 00:49:24,723
Doom, essentially pretty much every battle in Doom is a linear path, right?

943
00:49:24,783 --> 00:49:29,325
You enter the arena, the demons come out, your role is to kill all the demons and then

944
00:49:29,345 --> 00:49:30,125
you kind of move forward.

945
00:49:30,365 --> 00:49:32,086
It's this very kind of linear progression.

946
00:49:33,106 --> 00:49:38,448
Now we chose not to do too much crazy dynamic music stuff within that structure because

947
00:49:38,488 --> 00:49:40,669
it just seemed to get into the way of the groove.

948
00:49:41,129 --> 00:49:45,370
Basically when that player started and those demons came in, we just wanted it to be on.

949
00:49:45,630 --> 00:49:47,873
Just on, just going, just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.

950
00:49:48,133 --> 00:49:50,796
Just like you've jumped in the car and you've hit play on that album, right?

951
00:49:50,816 --> 00:49:52,077
You're just going, you're off, off.

952
00:49:53,539 --> 00:49:54,339
So that was the biggest thing.

953
00:49:54,480 --> 00:49:57,503
There was a couple of little things that we did, obviously when you do the glory kills,

954
00:49:57,543 --> 00:50:00,326
the music drops out and there's a little riser that happens.

955
00:50:01,527 --> 00:50:04,990
We didn't really know how long each glory kill was going to take,

956
00:50:05,351 --> 00:50:07,913
so I made a series of what I call endless risers.

957
00:50:08,974 --> 00:50:11,056
These are essentially looping rises.

958
00:50:11,116 --> 00:50:12,617
Now I know that's a break in terminology,

959
00:50:12,637 --> 00:50:13,377
but let me explain it.

960
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:15,619
Basically we're taking a shepherd's tone.

961
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:17,000
You ever know what a shepherd's tone is?

962
00:50:18,080 --> 00:50:18,240
Yeah?

963
00:50:18,621 --> 00:50:20,822
Okay, basically it's just taking a series of notes

964
00:50:20,842 --> 00:50:22,263
that go from low to high, right?

965
00:50:22,643 --> 00:50:24,665
When those notes are coming in high,

966
00:50:25,385 --> 00:50:27,427
you're kind of fading in the lower notes again.

967
00:50:27,447 --> 00:50:28,727
It's a little bit more complicated than that.

968
00:50:29,068 --> 00:50:30,869
I really encourage you to jump on Google and check it out.

969
00:50:30,889 --> 00:50:31,829
It's a really interesting thing.

970
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:36,691
But if you use this philosophy you can create these looping rises, it just feels constantly

971
00:50:36,731 --> 00:50:38,092
like there's this tension rising.

972
00:50:38,132 --> 00:50:41,353
It's really really handy in game environments when you're stuck in a situation where you

973
00:50:41,373 --> 00:50:43,154
don't know how long something is going to go for.

974
00:50:43,234 --> 00:50:43,774
So we did that.

975
00:50:44,915 --> 00:50:49,416
And then other times we started to experiment with this idea of like the music had started

976
00:50:49,457 --> 00:50:53,258
and like there was the hi-hat and the basic riff kicking along and then bam when everything

977
00:50:53,298 --> 00:50:55,739
kicked in that's when the music would start and that's when it really kicked in.

978
00:50:56,199 --> 00:50:59,801
Honestly, that's as complicated as the dynamic music system in Doom was.

979
00:51:00,162 --> 00:51:03,684
How I delivered that stuff to the team, I would always break my songs out and put that

980
00:51:03,724 --> 00:51:07,065
stuff into Wwise and then I'd send the Wwise files off to the team.

981
00:51:07,386 --> 00:51:12,609
The stuff I'd break out was mainly just for variation, so we didn't have a single three

982
00:51:12,649 --> 00:51:13,129
minute loop.

983
00:51:13,469 --> 00:51:17,391
I would break that down into a series of different bars so it would be constantly rearranging.

984
00:51:17,852 --> 00:51:21,594
But it's not rearranging on any data or anything like that, it's just going from there.

985
00:51:22,714 --> 00:51:29,196
That's very different to another project that I'm on at the moment where we're exploring all sorts of really interesting stuff that you can do with dynamic music.

986
00:51:30,196 --> 00:51:32,137
So yeah, there's all sorts of different ways you can take it.

987
00:51:32,457 --> 00:51:33,077
Thanks for the question.

988
00:51:33,377 --> 00:51:34,677
That's really exciting. Thank you.

989
00:51:34,737 --> 00:51:35,077
Thank you.

990
00:51:36,738 --> 00:51:39,518
Hi, thank you for a super nerdy talk.

991
00:51:40,119 --> 00:51:43,980
Actually I have three very quick, very nerdy questions.

992
00:51:44,552 --> 00:51:48,494
So first of all, the setup that you made, you used sine waves, right?

993
00:51:48,634 --> 00:51:48,794
Yes.

994
00:51:49,114 --> 00:51:53,336
Didn't you experiment with sole waves, square waves, just to get more harmonics?

995
00:51:53,416 --> 00:51:54,097
Yeah, interesting.

996
00:51:54,137 --> 00:51:56,878
So the first thing, basically everything started as a sine wave.

997
00:51:57,799 --> 00:52:01,481
What I wanted to do, as I said before, was to kind of capture whatever the pedal was

998
00:52:01,521 --> 00:52:02,381
going to add to it.

999
00:52:02,981 --> 00:52:07,944
Now if one of those pedals has a preamp stage that's ramping that sine wave up into clipping

1000
00:52:08,004 --> 00:52:12,066
range, and then it runs through a clipper that's clipping off that sine wave, you're

1001
00:52:12,106 --> 00:52:13,447
creating a square wave there.

1002
00:52:14,187 --> 00:52:17,271
So some of those things would happen naturally and organically within that system.

1003
00:52:17,691 --> 00:52:21,215
I didn't experiment with any other waves being sent through it, everything was sine waves.

1004
00:52:21,555 --> 00:52:26,080
What I did do a couple of times though, was send two sine waves through the system

1005
00:52:26,381 --> 00:52:28,483
that were slightly pitched differently.

1006
00:52:29,124 --> 00:52:33,448
So to create this phase imbalance, and that would do all sorts of crazy stuff to the pedals.

1007
00:52:34,147 --> 00:52:35,527
Okay, another question.

1008
00:52:36,448 --> 00:52:39,108
That setup created actually these really punchy,

1009
00:52:39,168 --> 00:52:40,248
high-attack sounds, right?

1010
00:52:40,588 --> 00:52:41,929
Did you put an envelope on it,

1011
00:52:42,069 --> 00:52:43,549
or was it just the compressor working?

1012
00:52:43,709 --> 00:52:45,369
So a lot of the time it was a combination of things.

1013
00:52:45,529 --> 00:52:48,170
One was the splitter sending to the sidechain compressors.

1014
00:52:48,710 --> 00:52:50,670
I would send the signal out,

1015
00:52:50,750 --> 00:52:53,291
and I'd set the attack so it would be, say,

1016
00:52:53,691 --> 00:52:54,591
.3 or 30, whatever it is, 30.

1017
00:52:55,171 --> 00:52:56,292
So yeah, 30 milliseconds.

1018
00:52:56,632 --> 00:52:57,792
And that usually creates a really,

1019
00:52:57,812 --> 00:52:59,032
really nice and sharp attack.

1020
00:52:59,412 --> 00:53:03,796
And then everything was running through a slow compressor at the end that was really pinning things back like that.

1021
00:53:04,677 --> 00:53:09,702
Once that came into the computer, I might do some more processing within the computer itself,

1022
00:53:09,742 --> 00:53:14,606
such as transient processing and things like that, just to kind of get those transients really to punch through.

1023
00:53:15,207 --> 00:53:19,030
Transients, I believe, are really the key to getting a really punchy sounding game mix.

1024
00:53:19,550 --> 00:53:23,253
When you've got all these sound effects and screams and gunshots and all this sort of stuff going through,

1025
00:53:23,573 --> 00:53:27,856
if you've got just a solidly limited thing sitting in the background, it doesn't come through.

1026
00:53:28,156 --> 00:53:32,679
What you want is those dynamics going, hey I'm a punch, then I'm gone, hey I'm a punch, then I'm gone.

1027
00:53:32,939 --> 00:53:36,881
And that tricks the player's ear into believing that there's more solid music happening in the background.

1028
00:53:37,240 --> 00:53:46,884
Okay, final simple question. Did you only use a DAW or actually maybe use some hardware sequencers or arpeggiators and these kind of things?

1029
00:53:46,964 --> 00:53:52,367
No I didn't. I had a Eurorack system that I used to generate a whole bunch of different stuff that I used.

1030
00:53:52,587 --> 00:53:58,610
I didn't really talk about it in this talk because that's kind of general sort of stuff, set up a synth, set up a sequencer, play some stuff.

1031
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:05,213
I mean people have kind of done that stuff a lot. So I did use a little bit of that, but once we created that sort of array, that Doom array system...

1032
00:54:05,793 --> 00:54:09,537
I found that was enough to get really interesting, pure textures that were coming out that really

1033
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:10,898
suited the game itself.

1034
00:54:11,438 --> 00:54:11,679
Okay.

1035
00:54:12,239 --> 00:54:13,140
Thank you so much for the talk.

1036
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:13,741
Cool, no worries.

1037
00:54:14,001 --> 00:54:16,323
I hope you don't mind if I rip off an experiment with your setup.

1038
00:54:16,363 --> 00:54:17,024
Yeah, no, please.

1039
00:54:17,064 --> 00:54:18,165
That's the idea of sharing, right?

1040
00:54:18,205 --> 00:54:19,326
That's the whole idea of GDC.

1041
00:54:19,386 --> 00:54:19,586
Please.

1042
00:54:19,606 --> 00:54:20,227
Awesome.

1043
00:54:20,247 --> 00:54:20,707
Thank you very much.

1044
00:54:20,727 --> 00:54:21,048
Thank you.

1045
00:54:24,058 --> 00:54:26,960
Great talk, I'm glad we didn't all kill each other when the music went on.

1046
00:54:27,780 --> 00:54:28,181
There's still time.

1047
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:34,165
First question, I'd love to hear your take on sequencing when you release the songs just

1048
00:54:34,185 --> 00:54:35,385
to be listened to on your stereo.

1049
00:54:35,405 --> 00:54:38,568
The soundtrack came out, I play it a lot, I almost kill people listening to it.

1050
00:54:39,148 --> 00:54:41,990
What recommendation do you have based on your experience with this soundtrack along with

1051
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:46,313
others about sequencing lots of different content from your Eyes full-on songs to your

1052
00:54:46,333 --> 00:54:47,113
sort of dip stuff?

1053
00:54:47,473 --> 00:54:48,914
Yeah, I'm glad you raised that question as well.

1054
00:54:48,954 --> 00:54:49,475
Thank you so much.

1055
00:54:50,775 --> 00:54:54,437
I believe that a soundtrack is usually a wasted opportunity with a video game.

1056
00:54:55,557 --> 00:54:58,178
I really get so disappointed when I'm a big fan of the game,

1057
00:54:58,278 --> 00:54:59,979
and then the soundtrack itself comes out,

1058
00:55:00,719 --> 00:55:04,201
and the soundtrack is just like a whole bunch of loops that they've pulled out of Wwise

1059
00:55:04,241 --> 00:55:06,262
and then thrown on an iTunes playlist or whatever.

1060
00:55:06,962 --> 00:55:10,243
For me, the soundtrack is the absolute best opportunity

1061
00:55:10,583 --> 00:55:13,604
to put forth the best representation of that music.

1062
00:55:14,621 --> 00:55:17,622
So it's something that needs to be treated almost like a separate project.

1063
00:55:18,322 --> 00:55:19,923
We had a lot of fun on the soundtrack.

1064
00:55:20,683 --> 00:55:23,284
We had these monologues that I pulled from the game,

1065
00:55:23,324 --> 00:55:26,065
basically voiceover files that were pulled from the game.

1066
00:55:26,745 --> 00:55:29,947
And I used those to separate these different segments of the soundtrack,

1067
00:55:30,527 --> 00:55:33,148
which was basically inspired by sort of 70s and 80s

1068
00:55:34,048 --> 00:55:36,269
concept albums, like sort of metal albums.

1069
00:55:36,609 --> 00:55:39,550
I was hugely inspired by the War of the Worlds concept album.

1070
00:55:40,679 --> 00:55:44,840
And then yeah, just made some pretty cool arrangements and stuff like that that people would enjoy it too.

1071
00:55:45,220 --> 00:55:46,961
It's important to understand the context.

1072
00:55:47,041 --> 00:55:49,462
A soundtrack needs to be enjoyed on its own.

1073
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:51,382
You need to be able to put that soundtrack in the car

1074
00:55:52,022 --> 00:55:55,003
and use it as a memento from your time playing with the game.

1075
00:55:56,004 --> 00:55:58,605
It's a lot more than just a collection of loops that you pull out of the game

1076
00:55:58,645 --> 00:56:00,345
just to make some sort of marketing opportunity.

1077
00:56:01,093 --> 00:56:01,273
Cool.

1078
00:56:01,573 --> 00:56:02,414
And a quick follow up.

1079
00:56:02,434 --> 00:56:04,895
Do you have hints about the remaining Easter eggs?

1080
00:56:04,955 --> 00:56:06,016
I think you said there are five.

1081
00:56:06,076 --> 00:56:07,497
Yeah, so there's five Easter eggs.

1082
00:56:07,937 --> 00:56:09,158
I think four have been found.

1083
00:56:09,178 --> 00:56:11,940
There's one that hasn't been found yet.

1084
00:56:13,781 --> 00:56:14,541
Yeah, I don't know.

1085
00:56:14,581 --> 00:56:16,542
Keep looking.

1086
00:56:17,683 --> 00:56:18,083
Thanks, Ed.

1087
00:56:18,404 --> 00:56:18,704
Hi, Mick.

1088
00:56:19,064 --> 00:56:19,264
Arnie.

1089
00:56:19,684 --> 00:56:20,045
Hey, Arnie.

1090
00:56:21,562 --> 00:56:26,404
I wanted to know, since you've finished this project, if you've had to spend some time

1091
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:30,525
like in the church to purify your wicked soul?

1092
00:56:30,545 --> 00:56:33,126
Oh look, I mean I didn't put that stuff in there to offend anybody.

1093
00:56:33,146 --> 00:56:34,006
I mean it probably did, right?

1094
00:56:34,026 --> 00:56:35,227
I mean of course if anybody's going to do that.

1095
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:36,887
Obviously people got pretty upset about that sort of stuff.

1096
00:56:38,652 --> 00:56:40,715
It's silly for me to say that's not the intention.

1097
00:56:40,735 --> 00:56:42,337
I mean, I can say it's not the intention,

1098
00:56:42,478 --> 00:56:44,901
but once it leaves me in my own mind,

1099
00:56:45,241 --> 00:56:46,523
I have no control over it.

1100
00:56:46,643 --> 00:56:47,745
It's out there, okay?

1101
00:56:48,406 --> 00:56:50,429
Now, I understood that when we were playing in that realm,

1102
00:56:50,549 --> 00:56:51,330
it's gonna happen.

1103
00:56:51,911 --> 00:56:52,652
I felt it was...

1104
00:56:53,853 --> 00:56:58,814
We were able to do it in Doom because Doom itself is full of demons, full of pentagrams, full of religious stuff.

1105
00:56:59,314 --> 00:57:01,975
The story behind Doom is that this evil corporation

1106
00:57:02,735 --> 00:57:08,137
has the people that work for the corporation under such a tight roll of the thumb that they're able to get away with all sorts

1107
00:57:08,177 --> 00:57:15,738
of things. The corporation itself, once you get higher up in the corporation levels, you can opt in to become a human sacrifice

1108
00:57:16,419 --> 00:57:20,340
and things like this. So, I mean, there's all sorts of that stuff that's in the game already.

1109
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:21,901
Thanks man, amazing score.

1110
00:57:21,921 --> 00:57:22,461
Yeah, cheers.

1111
00:57:23,442 --> 00:57:24,063
Good question.

1112
00:57:26,185 --> 00:57:26,365
Yo.

1113
00:57:26,666 --> 00:57:27,286
Hi there.

1114
00:57:27,467 --> 00:57:30,169
So I'm a graphics programmer, so please correct me if I'm full of shit.

1115
00:57:30,550 --> 00:57:35,615
But I noticed a bunch of Doom themes coming out in the music, and I was kind of surprised

1116
00:57:35,635 --> 00:57:36,916
you didn't mention that in your talk.

1117
00:57:37,016 --> 00:57:37,297
Yeah, of course.

1118
00:57:37,317 --> 00:57:40,720
So what was your process there in like integrating those themes and choosing what themes to put

1119
00:57:40,740 --> 00:57:40,780
in?

1120
00:57:40,800 --> 00:57:41,201
Yeah, of course.

1121
00:57:41,221 --> 00:57:42,041
And how did you put them in?

1122
00:57:42,362 --> 00:57:43,143
Yeah, no, good question.

1123
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:43,523
Thanks.

1124
00:57:44,764 --> 00:57:49,168
Again, I always feel it's a wasted opportunity when you're working on a pre-existing franchise

1125
00:57:49,208 --> 00:57:51,890
that you don't pay some tribute to what's happened in the past.

1126
00:57:51,950 --> 00:57:53,672
I feel that's really, really super important.

1127
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,754
I didn't talk about it so much in this talk.

1128
00:57:55,974 --> 00:57:58,436
I've talked about that in a couple of other talks, and I wanted to focus more on those

1129
00:57:58,456 --> 00:58:03,080
sort of geeky details that I can't talk about at, say, some other conference, right?

1130
00:58:03,120 --> 00:58:05,642
But yeah, to me it's really super important to do that.

1131
00:58:06,503 --> 00:58:08,525
Those themes, whether we like it or not...

1132
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:12,991
work their way into the consciousness of the fan base.

1133
00:58:13,071 --> 00:58:15,174
The fans are expecting to hear that.

1134
00:58:15,395 --> 00:58:21,704
It to them is as much of an icon within that game universe as the name Doom itself.

1135
00:58:22,124 --> 00:58:23,046
That's very, very important.

1136
00:58:23,767 --> 00:58:27,749
chose which ones to use? Basically I'd just be working on a track and see

1137
00:58:27,789 --> 00:58:30,591
whichever sort of theme I could fit in there. Sometimes I work them in in a

1138
00:58:30,632 --> 00:58:36,556
really obvious way. The theme for the baddie in the game, hers is based

1139
00:58:36,676 --> 00:58:40,879
on one of the Bobby Prince's original themes very very clearly, but some other

1140
00:58:40,919 --> 00:58:43,701
times they'd just be like a riff that would come in for two or three seconds

1141
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:44,701
and then it would go back out.

1142
00:58:44,962 --> 00:58:46,483
And it's just so the player playing can go,

1143
00:58:46,623 --> 00:58:47,884
oh yeah, cool, it's a Doom game,

1144
00:58:48,104 --> 00:58:49,465
and then they go back into killing demons

1145
00:58:49,505 --> 00:58:50,145
and stuff like that.

1146
00:58:50,705 --> 00:58:52,026
So, yeah, that's it.

1147
00:58:52,326 --> 00:58:53,067
Good question though, cheers.

1148
00:58:53,087 --> 00:58:53,667
Awesome, thanks for the talk.

1149
00:58:53,787 --> 00:58:54,248
Yeah, no worries.

1150
00:58:54,468 --> 00:58:55,709
I probably got time for one more,

1151
00:58:55,749 --> 00:58:56,849
so this is really cool, yeah.

1152
00:58:56,969 --> 00:58:57,690
There's only one more.

1153
00:58:57,950 --> 00:58:58,550
Yeah, no worries.

1154
00:58:59,151 --> 00:59:01,452
Could you briefly touch on how the music works

1155
00:59:01,512 --> 00:59:02,713
with the sound design in general?

1156
00:59:02,733 --> 00:59:04,094
Because I feel like sound design

1157
00:59:04,154 --> 00:59:06,776
is a major storytelling tool.

1158
00:59:07,608 --> 00:59:15,591
Yeah, cool, no of course. So I don't feel 100% confident talking about this because I wasn't in control and charge of this sort of thing.

1159
00:59:15,971 --> 00:59:19,212
That responsibility obviously falls onto the sound team and the audio director.

1160
00:59:19,912 --> 00:59:23,293
But I can talk about the stuff that we made sure that we did together.

1161
00:59:24,534 --> 00:59:28,715
For a tight mix, for me, one of the most important things is tonal elements.

1162
00:59:29,936 --> 00:59:32,898
So if there's a tonal element that's happening in the game,

1163
00:59:33,398 --> 00:59:37,062
it's very important that that is in a similar key, or same key, or same root note,

1164
00:59:37,082 --> 00:59:39,444
or whatever it might be, of the music that's playing.

1165
00:59:39,464 --> 00:59:42,987
So you'll notice in a couple of levels there you pick up a chaingun, right?

1166
00:59:43,307 --> 00:59:46,469
And this chaingun is able to be split out into three chainguns.

1167
00:59:46,489 --> 00:59:49,072
So you've got like this ultimate killer chaingun thing going on, right?

1168
00:59:49,172 --> 00:59:49,672
Yeah, the turret.

1169
00:59:49,872 --> 00:59:51,853
And the sound of this chain gun,

1170
00:59:53,054 --> 00:59:55,135
the bullets firing out of it happening so quickly

1171
00:59:55,175 --> 00:59:56,336
that it produces a tone.

1172
00:59:56,636 --> 00:59:58,077
That was the philosophy behind that.

1173
00:59:58,578 --> 01:00:01,499
Now we made sure that the tone of that was a D note.

1174
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:02,680
It was a low D note.

1175
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:05,101
And that D note was sitting with the same music

1176
01:00:05,121 --> 01:00:06,202
that was sitting in the background,

1177
01:00:06,222 --> 01:00:07,683
which is also sitting on a D.

1178
01:00:08,624 --> 01:00:11,426
So when you do that, you get this really solid mix that's happening.

1179
01:00:11,446 --> 01:00:13,007
You don't have frequencies that are clashing.

1180
01:00:14,008 --> 01:00:18,953
My best thing that I can say about that really is that it's something that really needs to be considered on every project.

1181
01:00:19,033 --> 01:00:25,018
It's not an afterthought, and it's not something that you can fix in Wwise or whatever you're using later on.

1182
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:30,363
If you're ducking stuff when something else happens, or if you're trying to compress this when this is happening,

1183
01:00:30,663 --> 01:00:33,445
you're fixing a problem that shouldn't be there in the first place.

1184
01:00:34,166 --> 01:00:38,729
Now those tools exist to allow us to fix that, but ultimately if you can carve your sounds

1185
01:00:38,769 --> 01:00:41,851
and your music with that stuff in mind to begin with, you're going to end up with a

1186
01:00:41,891 --> 01:00:43,892
much tighter mix in the end.

1187
01:00:44,712 --> 01:00:45,193
Thank you very much.

1188
01:00:45,213 --> 01:00:45,353
Cool.

1189
01:00:45,933 --> 01:00:48,214
Thank you so much everybody, have a really good GDC!
