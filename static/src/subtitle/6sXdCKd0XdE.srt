1
00:00:12,426 --> 00:00:12,766
All right.

2
00:00:14,007 --> 00:00:19,930
Looks like I'm live and we're ready to start talking about some RPGs and theft.

3
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:24,513
See, I knew there were going to be fans of theft in this audience.

4
00:00:25,454 --> 00:00:27,315
So what are we talking about today?

5
00:00:28,015 --> 00:00:39,501
We're talking about role-playing games, the tabletop variety, not just the video game type, but specifically the wide and wondrous world of interesting mechanics and styles and books.

6
00:00:39,881 --> 00:00:41,582
And there are a lot of them.

7
00:00:43,163 --> 00:00:44,224
That's part of why I did this talk.

8
00:00:44,244 --> 00:00:51,588
There's just so much to wade through and so much to steal and put in our video games.

9
00:00:52,912 --> 00:00:56,574
I've heard it kind of has occasionally worked, so let's get into it.

10
00:00:58,355 --> 00:00:58,835
Who am I?

11
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:01,177
So for those who don't know, my name's Evan Hill.

12
00:01:01,357 --> 00:01:03,618
I've been a level designer for about 10 years.

13
00:01:04,118 --> 00:01:06,299
I'm currently at Obsidian, making Outer Worlds 2.

14
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,761
I also used to be a part of Naughty Dog, making The Last of Us Part 2.

15
00:01:10,622 --> 00:01:20,287
Also somewhat relevant, I've made Torment Tides of Numenera, Solar Ash, worked on a game called Palea, and very specifically, this one, inspired by a follow-up

16
00:01:20,527 --> 00:01:29,072
by Planescape Torment is really relevant to this talk because it's one of the few major games to adapt Monty Cook's cipher system.

17
00:01:29,112 --> 00:01:30,192
It's very different than D&D.

18
00:01:30,532 --> 00:01:31,593
It's rather complicated.

19
00:01:31,913 --> 00:01:33,254
We don't have time to get into it now.

20
00:01:34,274 --> 00:01:36,996
Got a lot of slides to get through, so let's just get to the stealing.

21
00:01:37,776 --> 00:01:39,197
So here's the plan.

22
00:01:39,817 --> 00:01:41,478
I'm going to walk you guys through each game.

23
00:01:41,678 --> 00:01:42,619
We're going to case the joint.

24
00:01:43,239 --> 00:01:49,683
We're going to study the mechanics, and then we're going to figure out how to steal it and fence, I mean, put it into our own video games.

25
00:01:51,004 --> 00:01:52,164
And then we're going to learn from others.

26
00:01:53,065 --> 00:01:53,945
So here are the targets.

27
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:57,966
I've broken this down into six simple steps, targets, areas.

28
00:01:58,286 --> 00:02:02,287
We're going to talk about characters and time, basically character stats, interesting things like that.

29
00:02:02,647 --> 00:02:07,848
Weird resolutions, which is bonkers ways that you can play games instead of rolling dice.

30
00:02:08,868 --> 00:02:11,309
Short and sweet, one-page RPGs and the absolute

31
00:02:11,989 --> 00:02:15,411
territory of strange, interesting things that come out of there.

32
00:02:16,212 --> 00:02:22,356
Ancient knowledge, where we're going to start talking about people reviving the more Gygaxian days of tabletop RPGs.

33
00:02:22,856 --> 00:02:25,518
And I'm not going to explain Disco Myst Apocalypse yet.

34
00:02:25,678 --> 00:02:26,999
You can get there when we get there.

35
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:29,621
First, let's do characters and time.

36
00:02:30,421 --> 00:02:35,585
How could I start a talk about stealing without first talking about Blades in the Dark by John Harper?

37
00:02:36,991 --> 00:02:38,051
There's a reason for the hoots.

38
00:02:38,371 --> 00:02:39,932
This game is phenomenal.

39
00:02:40,352 --> 00:02:49,294
And one of the first things we're gonna dive into is, other than it's just basically greatness, it's basically a tabletop Dishonored, for those who don't know.

40
00:02:49,494 --> 00:02:53,115
That's all we really need to jump into the best first mechanic, which is flashbacks.

41
00:02:53,715 --> 00:02:57,796
Like any good heist movie, this game allows us to meet an obstacle.

42
00:02:58,216 --> 00:03:06,438
And instead of actively trying to solve it in the moment, we can jump backwards in time and say, fix it before we even got there.

43
00:03:07,526 --> 00:03:08,647
Say you see a guard around a corner.

44
00:03:09,387 --> 00:03:20,174
In Blades in the Dark, instead of stealthing behind him or trying to take him out non-lethally, you can say, I jumped back to a week ago where I threatened his life with a gun or bribed him.

45
00:03:20,914 --> 00:03:23,556
And then we actively make that roll to see whether or not you succeeded.

46
00:03:24,296 --> 00:03:26,777
Already we can see the opportunities this provides.

47
00:03:26,938 --> 00:03:32,661
And a lot of games have started to do this rather successfully, where we take an obstacle and instead of just

48
00:03:33,547 --> 00:03:38,389
letting the player figure it out with their tools at hand, we get this rich cornucopia of options.

49
00:03:38,769 --> 00:03:40,991
We can do a lot more social gameplay.

50
00:03:41,151 --> 00:03:50,495
We can interject and incorporate skills that aren't necessarily your stunning, your stealthing, or immediate on-hand gear into the gameplay loop.

51
00:03:51,348 --> 00:03:52,329
I mean, I think there's a lot of opportunities.

52
00:03:52,349 --> 00:04:05,916
We've got a lot to cover, but say, like, with Assassin's Creed, the RPGification of that series is going further and further, and can you imagine if, like, we go back to being Ezio and I can bribe a guard just as easily as I can stab him in the neck?

53
00:04:05,936 --> 00:04:07,537
I kind of want to play that game.

54
00:04:09,318 --> 00:04:11,419
But you might be asking, this is a really powerful ability.

55
00:04:11,559 --> 00:04:12,360
How does Blades in the Dark

56
00:04:13,376 --> 00:04:15,397
balance this idea of time travel.

57
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:17,518
Pretty well I'd say.

58
00:04:17,638 --> 00:04:19,419
It uses a system called stress.

59
00:04:20,200 --> 00:04:26,603
So stress in Blades of the Dark is kind of like this expendable resource that also is a measure of your mental health.

60
00:04:27,183 --> 00:04:33,587
So anytime you do a flashback, push yourself on a roll, or try to undo something bad happening to you immediately, you can take a stress

61
00:04:34,445 --> 00:04:34,525
it's

62
00:04:56,417 --> 00:05:00,378
tangibly taxing my body and character beyond their normal limits.

63
00:05:00,878 --> 00:05:01,958
What's the consequence of that?

64
00:05:02,418 --> 00:05:12,461
I think Darkest Dungeon demonstrates a really good example of this, even though I would say this kind of leans much more into that second health bar territory, where it's, you know, your mental health points.

65
00:05:13,741 --> 00:05:18,822
But, more than that, it's long-term consequences, I think, are just something phenomenal to learn from.

66
00:05:19,282 --> 00:05:23,543
As I said, stress focuses on something that's more than a second health bar.

67
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:28,300
But now, I think everybody who did the Woo is probably going to love this next one.

68
00:05:28,921 --> 00:05:30,062
We're gonna talk about clocks.

69
00:05:31,843 --> 00:05:35,105
So, the way Blades in the Darks works is really special.

70
00:05:35,525 --> 00:05:48,794
Instead of a normal quest log, instead of, you know, tracking inventory or hit points, you also track all of the myriad threads and events that are going on with really simple circles and note cards.

71
00:05:50,215 --> 00:05:51,776
And quickly, it starts looking like this.

72
00:05:53,018 --> 00:05:57,760
To explain it simply, a progress clock is just what it says.

73
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,681
It can represent anything.

74
00:06:00,361 --> 00:06:02,082
It can be a measure of the guard's alertness.

75
00:06:02,462 --> 00:06:04,703
It can be your vampire investigation.

76
00:06:05,084 --> 00:06:07,485
It could be time until the werewolf uprising.

77
00:06:07,905 --> 00:06:16,749
It is this flexible, tangible tool, and any time a player does a flashback, spends some stress, or nearly fails something, the GM is given the opportunity

78
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:20,858
to advance one of these various clocks as a response.

79
00:06:21,458 --> 00:06:36,106
And it creates this very winding clockwork experience where every little action is pushing and pulling on this wide variety of intricate threads and stories and states that would be nightmarish to write all the rules out for.

80
00:06:36,667 --> 00:06:40,029
Like a guard alert system is already complex enough that we have an entire stealth game genre.

81
00:06:40,469 --> 00:06:44,411
So this just lets us condense that all down and focus it.

82
00:06:46,311 --> 00:06:46,491
so far.

83
00:07:05,739 --> 00:07:07,140
Has some vibes of this though.

84
00:07:07,180 --> 00:07:26,165
It uses a real-world clock, but we'll talk about that in a bit Now we're gonna move on from Blades in the Dark because again, we've got a lot to cover Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard So this is a very beloved RPG series, this is one of my favorites by far

85
00:07:27,668 --> 00:07:41,860
So, initially built by Luke Crane as this kind of obscure, fantasy-focused role-playing system, it then partnered with David Peterson to make Mouseguard, which is a distillation and evolution of everything Burning Wheel was.

86
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,344
It is this very character-driven, nuanced experience.

87
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,142
all of your stats incrementally change over time.

88
00:07:49,242 --> 00:07:57,471
Your characters have very defined characteristics, identities, and those too, most startlingly of all, change over time.

89
00:07:58,091 --> 00:08:01,095
And the way it does this is through beliefs and instincts.

90
00:08:01,955 --> 00:08:03,937
So we're gonna just focus on MouseGuard for a second.

91
00:08:04,478 --> 00:08:10,044
In MouseGuard, you're basically in a medieval society, but you're made of tiny little guys.

92
00:08:11,226 --> 00:08:11,526
look at them.

93
00:08:12,227 --> 00:08:22,993
You're part mouse, part human, and as a result, there's this giant tapestry of roles, professions, identities, ideologies, all at play.

94
00:08:23,733 --> 00:08:27,255
And you get to roleplay that as a part of this intricate little society.

95
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:34,782
How the game defines it, both in Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard, is with beliefs and instincts.

96
00:08:35,322 --> 00:08:37,603
A belief is something kind of tangible.

97
00:08:37,843 --> 00:08:41,385
It is a concrete understanding of the world that the character has.

98
00:08:42,245 --> 00:08:45,467
And it is meant to be a stance.

99
00:08:45,807 --> 00:08:48,948
It is not just a wishy-washy, like, oh, I believe hope should save the world.

100
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:54,191
It is something like, you're a peasant farmer, and you get to write down on your character sheet, I am the true king of this land.

101
00:08:55,652 --> 00:09:05,541
It is, for example, in Burning Wheel, this orc here, riding this wolf, has beliefs like, I must interrogate an elf, a dwarf, and a human to discover if they have minds like my own.

102
00:09:06,556 --> 00:09:09,417
Also, fuck the Legion, I will forge my own path.

103
00:09:10,318 --> 00:09:18,021
And then the little mouse on the side has an interesting little belief of a guard mouse needs to think with their head and feel with their heart.

104
00:09:18,321 --> 00:09:20,342
They can be simple little character threads.

105
00:09:20,442 --> 00:09:27,124
But where this then comes back into the mechanical is any time that you operate in accordance with these beliefs, you get rewarded.

106
00:09:27,504 --> 00:09:33,567
You're given persona points, you're given resources to further drive the story and push on a future role.

107
00:09:34,607 --> 00:09:35,748
And now an instinct is like,

108
00:09:36,707 --> 00:09:37,467
a baby version of it.

109
00:09:37,748 --> 00:09:40,589
They are the automatic behaviors your character is expected to do.

110
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:49,814
And these are really interesting because they are things that the GM is allowed to say that you do without you saying you do it.

111
00:09:50,815 --> 00:09:54,077
So an example of a good instinct is like, I always draw my sword at the sign of trouble.

112
00:09:54,877 --> 00:09:55,357
That's great.

113
00:09:56,158 --> 00:10:00,740
You can play it where you might get the equivalent of initiative role anytime something pops out at you.

114
00:10:01,441 --> 00:10:03,042
It's less great in a courthouse

115
00:10:05,270 --> 00:10:12,076
And now all of a sudden, you're being presented with these very character-driven trade-offs that can be often helpful, sometimes harmful.

116
00:10:12,977 --> 00:10:15,660
But even more interestingly, none of these are meant to be static.

117
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:19,203
The player and the character kind of weave over time.

118
00:10:19,223 --> 00:10:21,485
You're able to level up and alter these things.

119
00:10:21,985 --> 00:10:27,470
If, say, your belief is, I will always guard the prince and the prince dies, what happens now?

120
00:10:28,427 --> 00:10:31,168
And again, this tangible reward is always there.

121
00:10:32,028 --> 00:10:39,590
Going back to the instincts, any time that an instinct negatively affects you, the game design is explicit in that the player then gets that same resource if they opt into it.

122
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:44,372
You can decide to not draw your sword in the courthouse, but that extra XP is really good.

123
00:10:45,372 --> 00:10:48,113
So it drives the story forward.

124
00:10:50,390 --> 00:10:58,813
And some of you might have noticed that this is very similar to the cop types and thought cabinets in Disco Elysium because these people are very smart and they stole very good things.

125
00:11:01,014 --> 00:11:02,874
But I want you to think further on though.

126
00:11:02,975 --> 00:11:17,580
Like if we started implementing that in our RPGs closer to Mass Effect, we could demonstrate interesting character arcs like Commander Shepard's trust in Earth Authority or where they sit on the various relations between the different species.

127
00:11:18,646 --> 00:11:26,052
it would be one thing to decide whether the arachnid queen lives or dies, it'd be another knowing that your bonuses matter towards it.

128
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:34,358
Blowing it up versus sacrificing maybe like a half level worth of experience to change your beliefs now or otherwise adjust against it.

129
00:11:36,339 --> 00:11:37,800
I said, I'm not you.

130
00:11:38,381 --> 00:11:40,062
You can take this and run with it however you want.

131
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:43,845
But the one, this is the reason I made the talk though.

132
00:11:44,685 --> 00:11:47,748
This next set, vice and nature stats.

133
00:11:48,723 --> 00:11:53,905
So, in Burning Wheel and Mouse Guard, there are these unique categories of skills.

134
00:11:54,645 --> 00:12:01,607
They are not basket weaving, they are not sword fighting, they are these emotional aspects of your character.

135
00:12:02,427 --> 00:12:04,368
And they have massive trade-offs.

136
00:12:04,788 --> 00:12:11,430
So, to start with, in Burning Wheel, I think they're still a bit rough, but still very interesting to talk about.

137
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:15,591
The examples in Burning Wheel are greed, grief, and anger.

138
00:12:17,196 --> 00:12:18,377
They work just like your other stats.

139
00:12:19,457 --> 00:12:23,479
If you use them on a roll, you take your number and you roll that many dice.

140
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:26,541
Or you can combine them with like sword fighting and athletics.

141
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:29,822
They're usually very good.

142
00:12:30,663 --> 00:12:37,206
They give you the option to substitute on any roll a relatively high number.

143
00:12:38,426 --> 00:12:42,548
The catch is, you need to demonstrably show that it aligns with the vice.

144
00:12:42,628 --> 00:12:43,489
So let's take an example.

145
00:12:44,269 --> 00:12:45,630
If you have a four in greed,

146
00:12:47,311 --> 00:12:59,418
and there is an object that you want to bargain for, instead of using your charisma check, you can decide to use your greed stat and potentially get four times of an effective chance of getting it.

147
00:13:00,639 --> 00:13:05,662
The negative though, is like other stats in Burning Wheel, the more you use it, the more it levels up.

148
00:13:07,113 --> 00:13:11,776
And the more a vice stat levels up, the further your character is restricted from certain actions.

149
00:13:12,516 --> 00:13:13,737
Greed is another really good example.

150
00:13:13,777 --> 00:13:24,423
I believe if you get past rank three in it, anytime you are divvying things up, even something as simple as a pie, you are not allowed to divvy it up evenly and fairly with other people.

151
00:13:25,023 --> 00:13:27,065
You always, always have to take an edge.

152
00:13:27,125 --> 00:13:29,446
You always, always have to behave in a certain way.

153
00:13:30,406 --> 00:13:36,370
And right there, the player is given this arc, this option that's more than just,

154
00:13:36,738 --> 00:13:36,878
what's

155
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:56,321
even a step better.

156
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,443
Like, this is the truly refined version of it, and it's dead simple.

157
00:13:59,603 --> 00:14:01,365
Like, if you pause this, you'll be able to read this really quickly.

158
00:14:02,265 --> 00:14:12,133
The way MouseGuard works is, because you're just a cute little guy, if you do things that a tiny little mouse thing would do, you can substitute your nature stat.

159
00:14:12,273 --> 00:14:18,719
Basically, anything that's like climbing, escaping, hiding, foraging, you just get natural ability at doing that thing.

160
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:24,103
Now, where it gets interesting is you can also use it to act against your nature.

161
00:14:24,403 --> 00:14:25,344
Standing up and fighting,

162
00:14:25,754 --> 00:14:40,221
guarding, running through fire, anything that's against your nature, you can then substitute this stat that ranges usually from 1 to 7 in a game where 7 is like level 15, to do anything.

163
00:14:40,781 --> 00:14:43,383
But anytime you act against your nature, it taxes it.

164
00:14:43,643 --> 00:14:46,384
Meaning the next time you use it for any reason, it's one less rank.

165
00:14:47,285 --> 00:14:49,346
If you deplete it, you're going to

166
00:14:50,518 --> 00:14:54,740
lose an entire pip in it until you recover, possibly taking multiple sessions.

167
00:14:55,240 --> 00:15:07,106
So you're presenting the player with this easy road of good bonuses moving towards an alignment or a style or a class that you see as valuable and helpful, but they're not limited to that.

168
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:12,509
They are constantly given this choice to nitro boost their roles to try and succeed.

169
00:15:13,869 --> 00:15:16,911
But with that balancing consequence of the cost later,

170
00:15:17,728 --> 00:15:18,548
the character impact.

171
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:23,010
If you deplete your nature all the way, your character gets described as either obsessive or odd.

172
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:31,194
If you let your nature get too high, your character kind of settles and doesn't want to go out and adventure anymore, and they get negatives on both ends of the spectrum.

173
00:15:31,414 --> 00:15:46,321
And the game itself then suddenly demonstrates that it has this tension between these two different essences that the character has, both as a mouse and as a warrior or a craftsman or, you know, somebody who will go out and fight an owl face to face

174
00:15:47,762 --> 00:15:57,527
But yeah, what I really love about this, and again, the whole reason I built this talk, was because what we're seeing is something that is a resource and a stat all at once.

175
00:15:58,564 --> 00:16:07,086
You're able to spend this, stockpile it, utilize it however you want to shape the story, and how you use it naturally creates a dynamic character.

176
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:20,970
Even with this just singular access, you're showing a character's ups and downs, confronting with not only how they perceive the world or act in it, but their own internal landscape gets shifted one way or another depending on how this action goes out.

177
00:16:21,930 --> 00:16:25,551
And I can't think of a game where this wouldn't be interesting.

178
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:44,377
and yeah that's what we're here to do is just I think there's a ton of these tools that can just be put nearly anywhere but let's just keep going into the simple easy to steal stuff one of my favorite rules in burning wheel which is a game that's normally very complex is just roll versus bloody it's dead simple

179
00:16:45,427 --> 00:16:49,350
Two people fight, they just roll die and see who gets the bigger number and they get the damage.

180
00:16:49,911 --> 00:16:52,072
No checking against AC, no maneuvering.

181
00:16:52,152 --> 00:16:54,094
It's meant to be just like, oh, we can do a bar brawl.

182
00:16:55,295 --> 00:16:56,716
We're about the same strength, what happens?

183
00:16:57,477 --> 00:17:03,902
Some of you might notice that another favorite cop of ours also uses this mechanic because again, these people are very smart and I like them.

184
00:17:05,063 --> 00:17:07,405
But now we're on to part two, weird resolutions.

185
00:17:08,085 --> 00:17:10,247
So who here's played Jenga?

186
00:17:12,856 --> 00:17:19,404
So the games we're about to talk about are wonderful bits of design on completely opposite ends of the spectrum.

187
00:17:20,246 --> 00:17:26,874
In Dread, it is a survival horror game where every time you take a risky action, you need to take a block out of the Jenga tower.

188
00:17:27,094 --> 00:17:30,418
And if the Jenga tower falls over, everyone dies.

189
00:17:33,379 --> 00:17:38,701
And then in StarCrossed, you're playing a romantic scene between two StarCrossed lovers.

190
00:17:39,262 --> 00:17:42,203
And every time you take an action, you take a block out of the Jenga tower.

191
00:17:42,743 --> 00:17:45,865
And when it falls over, you have to make out now.

192
00:17:47,645 --> 00:17:50,006
That is the complete breaking point of the tension.

193
00:17:51,947 --> 00:18:00,351
And yeah, so the whole Jenga of it all, already we're seeing that like, when we talk about RPGs, when we talk about storytelling games, we don't need to be limited to just die and paper.

194
00:18:01,011 --> 00:18:02,752
We can produce the same kind of

195
00:18:03,194 --> 00:18:07,767
emerging behavior and engaging stuff with radically different tools and

196
00:18:08,786 --> 00:18:10,668
Well, I think this is like a fun example.

197
00:18:10,728 --> 00:18:13,450
I think there is even more unexplored territory here.

198
00:18:13,991 --> 00:18:17,013
So some of you might already be thinking, how do I put this in a video game?

199
00:18:17,313 --> 00:18:18,895
Oh, do I just model the physics of a Jenga tower?

200
00:18:19,796 --> 00:18:22,478
You might then realize that that's not necessarily the most compelling thing.

201
00:18:22,698 --> 00:18:24,600
It's also still just randomness and variety.

202
00:18:25,320 --> 00:18:27,282
But I think we're also missing another aspect of it.

203
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:35,229
If I have something like this, and I'm in a scene where there is a cataclysmic or critical event that happens when I knock it over,

204
00:18:36,428 --> 00:18:40,889
you're constantly giving your player the option to just flip the table over.

205
00:18:42,629 --> 00:18:57,972
If you're playing this in a negotiating game, instead of it being necessarily like, oh, when the Jenga tower falls, I fail, it's, I can decide to knock this over, walk out of here, maybe with my dignity intact, and certainly a lot of negative reputation, but some other way.

206
00:18:59,932 --> 00:19:02,152
This is also basically what happens in stealth games.

207
00:19:02,692 --> 00:19:05,593
So for my work in Last of Us, and my love of Metal Gear,

208
00:19:06,641 --> 00:19:11,783
One of the best ways to describe failing stealth is knocking the Jenga tower over.

209
00:19:12,623 --> 00:19:20,405
Sometimes you're going to deliberately try to pick it apart, move through paths, naturally just accidentally tip it over and things get loud.

210
00:19:21,365 --> 00:19:25,827
And other days, you're just gonna bust the door open with a shotgun and start screaming.

211
00:19:26,887 --> 00:19:31,708
And both of these are these valid, interesting, narratively relevant ways of approaching something.

212
00:19:32,248 --> 00:19:34,029
So, I think there's something there.

213
00:19:35,285 --> 00:19:38,527
but moving on still, roll and write.

214
00:19:39,008 --> 00:19:42,410
This one might be slightly unfamiliar to some people.

215
00:19:43,111 --> 00:19:48,195
It's a new kind of emerging genre, it's getting quite popular, where it's almost a solo game.

216
00:19:48,555 --> 00:19:55,601
You sit down with some friends, you roll some dice, you allocate those numbers onto a table, and you do things like build railroads or condominiums.

217
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:03,967
If you're thinking it sounds like Yahtzee, it essentially is, but there is this massive diversity of genre and style and mechanics

218
00:20:04,585 --> 00:20:06,187
And some people are already starting to use it.

219
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:11,431
Many of you have probably heard of Citizen Sleeper, and basically that's all this game is.

220
00:20:12,132 --> 00:20:19,118
At the beginning of the day, you're given a pool of dice of varying values, and the game and the story evolve depending on where you allocate them.

221
00:20:19,879 --> 00:20:25,664
Like, this was one of the most compelling games of last year, and it's essentially cyberpunk Yahtzee.

222
00:20:28,470 --> 00:20:29,150
and it doesn't end there.

223
00:20:30,811 --> 00:20:41,458
There's this survival space sim called Tharsis, I hope I'm pronouncing that right, that again, uses this same really simple mechanic to tell deep complicated stories about

224
00:20:42,361 --> 00:20:48,484
survival and resource allocation and just the risk of attempting risky maneuvers in the vacuum of space.

225
00:20:49,365 --> 00:20:52,026
And this doesn't have to state, like, in the survival main.

226
00:20:52,166 --> 00:20:54,327
Like, Dicey Dungeons came out, like, four years ago.

227
00:20:54,847 --> 00:21:01,691
I want to see more combat, more interaction mechanics that have the kind of pop and depth as this game.

228
00:21:01,751 --> 00:21:03,692
And I think it's not a hard sell.

229
00:21:07,845 --> 00:21:09,007
Some people are very smart.

230
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:12,791
But let's keep moving.

231
00:21:13,151 --> 00:21:16,616
So we also have one-page RPGs.

232
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:26,267
So often people think RPGs are these massive tomes that just require a master's degree to even approach, much less fully comprehend.

233
00:21:27,729 --> 00:21:27,829
No.

234
00:21:29,833 --> 00:21:35,134
Sometimes you just have a game like Honey Heist where you are a bunch of bear criminals with two stats, bear and criminal.

235
00:21:38,915 --> 00:21:41,856
And you can play this in an afternoon and just have a wonderful time with your friends.

236
00:21:42,336 --> 00:21:46,557
Or Sexy Battle Wizards, which just has sexy, battle, and wizard as stats.

237
00:21:47,018 --> 00:21:52,239
Or John is Everyone, where three of you get to play as John.

238
00:21:53,479 --> 00:21:54,779
and the voices inside of his head.

239
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:59,281
They're simple and cool, and I'm going to leave it at that because they're simple and cool.

240
00:22:00,941 --> 00:22:03,222
And now we're going to get into something a bit interesting.

241
00:22:04,863 --> 00:22:05,463
The OSR.

242
00:22:05,643 --> 00:22:11,865
For people who don't know, there's this trend among Dungeons & Dragons aficionados of the old school revival.

243
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:16,506
It's kind of an attempt to return to the traditional ways of like AD&D.

244
00:22:17,347 --> 00:22:18,147
There are some caveats.

245
00:22:19,522 --> 00:22:28,026
A lot of these people sometimes maybe go for the aesthetic of the 1980s a little too hard and end up coming off a little crusty.

246
00:22:28,567 --> 00:22:38,832
But I think the core of this thing is still very good and wholesome and really demonstrates some of the things that we're lacking in a lot of modern game design.

247
00:22:40,073 --> 00:22:41,253
Focuses on player agency.

248
00:22:42,314 --> 00:22:43,354
They tend to be rules light.

249
00:22:43,414 --> 00:22:46,256
One of my favorite systems in it is just about 10 pages as a pamphlet.

250
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,523
It's usually highly fatally and low power.

251
00:22:49,664 --> 00:22:55,633
So, you know, everybody's played a level one campaign or at least seen people try to stream it and die very quickly on it.

252
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,737
And it's usually very focused on resource management.

253
00:22:58,358 --> 00:22:58,979
Credit to...

254
00:23:01,246 --> 00:23:05,447
Credit to Lines for writing the article I got all that from.

255
00:23:05,867 --> 00:23:09,929
But some of the most standout people in this are Ben Milton.

256
00:23:10,609 --> 00:23:15,870
He's the one who wrote that small 10-page pamphlet I just mentioned called Knave, which you can just pick up and play.

257
00:23:16,030 --> 00:23:20,652
It is really approachable, really easy to play, and hits all the things that we're talking about.

258
00:23:20,992 --> 00:23:27,974
Even more importantly, he wrote one of my favorite dungeons of all time called The Waking of Willoughby Halls, where you are stuck in a haunted mansion,

259
00:23:29,980 --> 00:23:33,683
where another adventuring party runs in with a stolen goose from an angry giant.

260
00:23:33,923 --> 00:23:42,409
So you're dealing with this just lasagna of problems that turns into the tabletop equivalent of a Hitman level on acid.

261
00:23:44,370 --> 00:23:45,631
Can't sell that better than I just did.

262
00:23:45,911 --> 00:23:50,915
He also has an even shorter, even more condensed version called Maze Rats.

263
00:23:51,375 --> 00:23:52,957
This is just a couple pages.

264
00:23:53,337 --> 00:23:58,941
There are no classes and even when it comes to spell casting, you get one spell a day and you randomly roll it.

265
00:24:00,976 --> 00:24:09,862
It is just meant to be raw, immediate, quick, fun, that captures all of the beauty and all of the just intricacy of improv-ing with your friends.

266
00:24:11,823 --> 00:24:15,785
Another major standout that is always worth looking at is Chris McDonald's Into the Odd.

267
00:24:16,486 --> 00:24:21,309
So, its follow-up is even more stunning, and this is the one we're going to focus on here.

268
00:24:21,389 --> 00:24:22,850
It's called Electric Bastionland.

269
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:27,272
As a setting, as a piece of art, check it out for just that.

270
00:24:27,532 --> 00:24:29,774
There is an entire racial category for Muppets.

271
00:24:31,707 --> 00:24:32,487
I did not stutter.

272
00:24:34,268 --> 00:24:38,449
But one of the most interesting things of this and Knave is you can make a character in this game in less than five minutes.

273
00:24:38,749 --> 00:24:43,870
You just have three stats, you roll them, and then you figure out what failed career your character is.

274
00:24:44,250 --> 00:24:50,452
There is no quibbling over what color belt buckle do I need, but there is a random table for it if you really want to dig that far.

275
00:24:50,992 --> 00:24:56,974
And you can be everything from a science mystic, a prize breeder, a machine whisperer, there's a hundred plus of these things.

276
00:24:57,374 --> 00:25:00,455
And you are just meant to be thrown into this wild, strange world

277
00:25:00,919 --> 00:25:03,320
and all of these mechanics facilitate that.

278
00:25:03,340 --> 00:25:13,044
They facilitate you jumping into this setting with no need to be on ramp, no need to again sit down and do three hours of studying or session zero.

279
00:25:13,164 --> 00:25:13,564
You're just

280
00:25:14,713 --> 00:25:15,113
able to go.

281
00:25:36,326 --> 00:25:42,769
Hitman, anything with emergent sims or roguelike design, really finds its roots in these things.

282
00:25:42,989 --> 00:25:50,112
And even still, we're finding more to look back on and kind of harvest from this era of game design.

283
00:25:50,872 --> 00:26:01,577
There's just so much to be said about simplifying, about removing complexity and letting you just kind of get to the meat of the story, of the narrative, by getting out of the player's way and just letting them roll some numbers.

284
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:05,759
And now for my favorite part of this talk.

285
00:26:06,991 --> 00:26:08,232
The Disco Mist Apocalypse.

286
00:26:08,252 --> 00:26:08,992
This is the big score.

287
00:26:09,592 --> 00:26:13,855
This is the thing that during my research I kind of came across and absolutely fell in love with.

288
00:26:15,716 --> 00:26:18,137
There's this system called Apocalypse World.

289
00:26:19,478 --> 00:26:20,618
It's brilliant.

290
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:26,341
It kind of came out and was a bit obscure, but since then it's been continually licensed.

291
00:26:27,222 --> 00:26:29,403
There are multiple games that utilize this.

292
00:26:30,023 --> 00:26:35,807
Dungeon World, Monster Hearts, and I think most poignantly and the best example is City of Mist.

293
00:26:37,455 --> 00:26:38,356
What makes this thing special?

294
00:26:39,217 --> 00:26:47,367
Unlike all of these other settings, unlike all of these other systems, this is built story logic first.

295
00:26:48,408 --> 00:26:52,974
It's not coming from the ground up and trying to establish complex systems.

296
00:26:53,174 --> 00:26:54,716
It is, I want to take a story action.

297
00:26:55,016 --> 00:26:55,577
What's the result?

298
00:26:56,758 --> 00:27:00,821
And one of the benefits of this is it lets you have really simple characters, just like with the OSR.

299
00:27:01,461 --> 00:27:03,883
Here we have somebody who's based off Little Red Riding Hood.

300
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:06,565
Her abilities are not complicated rules text.

301
00:27:06,685 --> 00:27:10,248
They are literally bulletproof red hood, arsenal of hunting weapons, high school rumors.

302
00:27:10,428 --> 00:27:11,449
Those are the things she's good at.

303
00:27:11,889 --> 00:27:14,711
If you can justify her using any of those things, you get a bonus to your role.

304
00:27:15,191 --> 00:27:19,855
If you mess up on that role, you're going to take some consequences or partially accomplish your goal.

305
00:27:20,855 --> 00:27:33,284
uh we're running out of time a little bit so i'm just going to kind of speed through this but overall this system is wonderful you need to check it out we it's flexible it's able to render tons of characters of any variety and style

306
00:27:33,903 --> 00:27:36,264
and really all you need is what you see on this table.

307
00:27:37,025 --> 00:27:37,265
Dice?

308
00:27:38,005 --> 00:27:39,326
You don't even need these note cards.

309
00:27:39,806 --> 00:27:46,870
But the real reason I found this so compelling was very quickly I realized this is what Disco Elysium utilizes.

310
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:58,156
Not just, oh hey, we're rolling 2D6, or oh hey, we're using tags, but this very fundamental approach of story logic first, systems first,

311
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:00,474
not even tertiary.

312
00:28:01,375 --> 00:28:11,218
You're being presented with a game that focused on articulating the attributes of its character and seeing what happened.

313
00:28:11,398 --> 00:28:15,079
Failure being one of the most interesting parts about that equation.

314
00:28:15,899 --> 00:28:21,421
There's such things as near misses and interesting funny fuck-ups in this game

315
00:28:22,353 --> 00:28:34,906
and I really think it holds itself a lot of credit to the apocalypse system, whether or not this was conscious or unconscious, it wound up kind of blossoming out and it's what separates it from other games of its era, I think.

316
00:28:35,680 --> 00:28:46,347
and also why it's very difficult to just look at Disco Elysium, copy its stats, copy its systems, and attempt to get the same results because it's just so fundamentally about this top-down approach.

317
00:28:46,427 --> 00:28:48,808
That's why the Tribunal is so effective.

318
00:28:48,868 --> 00:28:52,151
There is no combat system in this game because it never needed one.

319
00:28:52,751 --> 00:28:59,055
It has a system for resolving story conflict, and it just presents any fight like a story conflict.

320
00:29:01,007 --> 00:29:10,296
And yeah, no, this talk might have kind of always secretly been a little bit of a love letter to Disco Elysium, and I'm unabashedly okay with that because they're very good.

321
00:29:12,178 --> 00:29:17,283
But we're running out of time, so we're going to skip through some of this bonus stuff that I was hopefully going to cram into the end.

322
00:29:18,064 --> 00:29:18,964
But you need to check these out.

323
00:29:19,345 --> 00:29:19,825
Pathologic 2.

324
00:29:20,831 --> 00:29:21,651
This is off the table.

325
00:29:21,811 --> 00:29:22,751
This is not a tabletop game.

326
00:29:23,011 --> 00:29:23,632
It's very good.

327
00:29:24,372 --> 00:29:26,612
You all need to use this quest system that they have.

328
00:29:27,452 --> 00:29:28,253
It is a mind map.

329
00:29:28,453 --> 00:29:29,253
It is not a quest log.

330
00:29:29,373 --> 00:29:31,293
It is not just a list of things you can do.

331
00:29:31,493 --> 00:29:37,835
It is wonderful and great, and I don't have time to gush about it now, but absolute credit to its designer.

332
00:29:39,175 --> 00:29:40,095
She's an absolute genius.

333
00:29:41,235 --> 00:29:42,115
Also, Notia.

334
00:29:42,476 --> 00:29:43,196
This is an odd one.

335
00:29:43,476 --> 00:29:49,337
This is a single-player visual novel, Among Us-like, where you are deciding and figuring out

336
00:29:49,741 --> 00:29:51,902
who to cold sleep because some of you are aliens.

337
00:29:52,822 --> 00:29:54,402
It also has a porpoise in a pressure chute.

338
00:29:56,283 --> 00:29:57,223
You need to play this game.

339
00:29:59,424 --> 00:30:05,886
But anyway, if you take anything away from this talk, it's learn and steal from the best.

340
00:30:07,446 --> 00:30:08,387
Don't feel ashamed of this.

341
00:30:08,867 --> 00:30:16,649
Game design, just like any other discipline, is something that is collaborative and evolving, and we stand on the shoulders of giants.

342
00:30:18,257 --> 00:30:19,819
And that's all we can really hope for.

343
00:30:20,299 --> 00:30:25,364
Even if a heist like this, like this talk that I gave, may have been a little less Mission Impossible and a little more Fish Called Wanda.

344
00:30:26,826 --> 00:30:27,547
Thank you for listening.

345
00:30:38,604 --> 00:30:49,256
You can also all follow me on Twitter, please rate the talk, and then hopefully I'll also have a little bit more to share of this little thing that's not a video game that will be coming soon.

346
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,663
But yeah, everyone have a wonderful GDC.

347
00:30:55,984 --> 00:30:57,886
I hope to see most of you all soon.
