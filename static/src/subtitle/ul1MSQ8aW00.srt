1
00:00:05,915 --> 00:00:06,215
Hello.

2
00:00:06,895 --> 00:00:07,215
All right.

3
00:00:09,056 --> 00:00:12,518
Lords, ladies, gentlemen, bees, welcome to what is hopefully the most you're going to

4
00:00:12,558 --> 00:00:16,200
think about power curves and collectible object games all year.

5
00:00:17,001 --> 00:00:19,102
My name is Dylan Exabyte Mayo.

6
00:00:19,442 --> 00:00:21,203
Twitter handle is up there on the screen.

7
00:00:21,243 --> 00:00:22,264
I'll show it at the end.

8
00:00:22,284 --> 00:00:25,365
You can always get in and talk with me on there.

9
00:00:25,786 --> 00:00:29,788
I tend to reply to a lot of questions and retreat stupid funny stuff.

10
00:00:31,374 --> 00:00:33,596
I'll give you a quick history on me.

11
00:00:33,996 --> 00:00:37,039
I've been playing TCG since they've been around with Magic's launch.

12
00:00:37,479 --> 00:00:42,763
And been making fan efforts, including Chaos Magic, which you see some insight in that

13
00:00:42,803 --> 00:00:45,605
that went into, like, the Plane Chase product that came out.

14
00:00:45,886 --> 00:00:48,848
And I've been playing, professionally making trading card games since about 2000.

15
00:00:51,430 --> 00:00:54,932
First trading card game that I professionally worked on was Magi Nation.

16
00:00:55,073 --> 00:00:58,455
There's a Game Boy Color RPG and trading card game that came out for that.

17
00:00:58,876 --> 00:01:00,958
and I was one of the designers on that.

18
00:01:01,719 --> 00:01:04,201
I also started my own trading card game company,

19
00:01:04,321 --> 00:01:06,203
Tenacious Games, where I created the Spoils,

20
00:01:06,684 --> 00:01:08,566
which has just terminated its run,

21
00:01:08,646 --> 00:01:11,769
giving it maybe the fifth longest run in TCG history,

22
00:01:11,809 --> 00:01:12,550
which is kind of neat.

23
00:01:13,811 --> 00:01:17,894
After that, I went and worked on Magic, kinda on the bench.

24
00:01:17,974 --> 00:01:20,635
I was working on a digital push for Wizards,

25
00:01:20,675 --> 00:01:22,837
but I was in the pit, so I was there for drafts

26
00:01:22,877 --> 00:01:24,138
and what have you, did whole filling.

27
00:01:24,158 --> 00:01:26,719
I was not a major designer on Magic,

28
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,641
but was there in the periphery.

29
00:01:29,321 --> 00:01:32,103
And since then, I've been working at Pokemon

30
00:01:32,383 --> 00:01:34,625
as the main person in charge of the Pokemon card game

31
00:01:35,025 --> 00:01:36,566
outside of Japan and Korea.

32
00:01:37,006 --> 00:01:39,468
I take the game that comes out of Japan and localize it

33
00:01:39,768 --> 00:01:41,389
and distribute it, make the products

34
00:01:41,449 --> 00:01:43,090
for all the markets around the world

35
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:45,594
for just over nine years now.

36
00:01:46,034 --> 00:01:48,178
So of course, given the background on these games today,

37
00:01:48,198 --> 00:01:50,061
we will mainly be talking about Hearthstone.

38
00:01:53,482 --> 00:01:58,507
Hearthstone has probably the simplest mana system of any major trading card game, which

39
00:01:58,547 --> 00:02:01,009
makes it really easy to be the basis for this talk.

40
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,033
When you're talking about a mana system, what you're really talking about is these numbers

41
00:02:06,113 --> 00:02:09,597
up here that tell you how much it costs cards to be put into play.

42
00:02:11,058 --> 00:02:15,162
In Hearthstone, if you are unfamiliar with Hearthstone, at the beginning of each turn

43
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:16,723
you will gain one mana.

44
00:02:17,444 --> 00:02:20,586
And then you can spend that mana to play your cards each turn.

45
00:02:20,786 --> 00:02:22,968
At the beginning of turn two, you'll have two mana.

46
00:02:23,088 --> 00:02:25,110
At the beginning of turn three, you'll have three mana.

47
00:02:25,730 --> 00:02:27,232
And so on in that fashion.

48
00:02:27,772 --> 00:02:29,734
So to play those cards cost,

49
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:32,216
you can play the one that costs two on turn two,

50
00:02:32,556 --> 00:02:33,697
or any turn after that,

51
00:02:33,757 --> 00:02:35,098
and you'll have some leftover mana.

52
00:02:35,945 --> 00:02:40,288
When you're talking about the ratio between how much a card costs and how powerful it is,

53
00:02:40,669 --> 00:02:41,830
there are two things to consider.

54
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:44,192
The cost, which we've got highlighted up here,

55
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,954
and everything else in the card is generally the power,

56
00:02:47,194 --> 00:02:48,996
and that's this bottom part down here.

57
00:02:50,237 --> 00:02:51,177
So as you can see,

58
00:02:51,798 --> 00:02:54,160
these are all what are known as vanilla creatures,

59
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,142
they just have power and life points,

60
00:02:56,502 --> 00:02:59,364
and as you pay more cost, you get more power for that.

61
00:02:59,785 --> 00:03:02,787
But how that's related is a little interesting to start looking at.

62
00:03:04,397 --> 00:03:07,519
So we can align these on a chart pretty easily.

63
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:11,381
We can put them, we can label an axis for cost

64
00:03:11,461 --> 00:03:14,043
along the bottom, one through nine I've got down there.

65
00:03:14,383 --> 00:03:18,325
However, aligning the axis for power is really hard to do.

66
00:03:18,545 --> 00:03:20,526
It is tough to look at a card in most card games,

67
00:03:20,726 --> 00:03:21,847
even simple cards as this.

68
00:03:22,527 --> 00:03:27,293
and give it a number. It's tough to say that that card has 17 power or this card has 15

69
00:03:27,754 --> 00:03:31,799
power. But we can gauge relatively the power levels of these cards and arrange them on

70
00:03:31,839 --> 00:03:36,645
the chart like this. And we get a nice little line that goes through there. But that is

71
00:03:36,725 --> 00:03:40,690
for these very simple cards and don't encompass the entirety of the cards within the game

72
00:03:40,731 --> 00:03:40,891
there.

73
00:03:43,236 --> 00:03:48,100
So at seven in Hearthstone, you can get War Golem,

74
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:50,682
which is a seven-seven with no card text on it at all.

75
00:03:51,163 --> 00:03:51,903
You can also get

76
00:03:52,845 --> 00:03:55,908
Prophet Velen, which is a 7-7 for seven,

77
00:03:56,288 --> 00:03:58,910
that has a lot of text on it that is very powerful.

78
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:01,812
So obviously Prophet Velen is a much more powerful card

79
00:04:02,292 --> 00:04:02,973
than War Golem.

80
00:04:03,313 --> 00:04:06,676
In fact, it would be hard-pressed to make a 7-7

81
00:04:06,736 --> 00:04:08,457
for seven mana with text on it

82
00:04:08,477 --> 00:04:10,579
that would be even more powerful than Prophet Velen

83
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,800
without making a card that would go in every deck

84
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,521
for a couple years.

85
00:04:15,407 --> 00:04:18,729
So we can arrange these cards power-wise on the same cost

86
00:04:18,749 --> 00:04:19,029
slot.

87
00:04:19,389 --> 00:04:20,530
We've got War Golem here.

88
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,871
We are going to throw the line back up there.

89
00:04:23,251 --> 00:04:24,111
There's Prophet Velen.

90
00:04:24,432 --> 00:04:26,633
And here's our good friend, Dr. Boo.

91
00:04:27,393 --> 00:04:30,074
So these are all cost 7, but clearly do not all

92
00:04:30,535 --> 00:04:31,595
have the same amount of power.

93
00:04:31,635 --> 00:04:33,296
So even as we zoo in on 7, there's

94
00:04:33,316 --> 00:04:35,237
going to be a range of powers at that 7 cost.

95
00:04:37,415 --> 00:04:42,158
So what that gets into is talking about how much you get

96
00:04:42,218 --> 00:04:47,001
for seven is even better than what you get for five plus two

97
00:04:47,201 --> 00:04:49,182
and that becomes pretty obvious when you start looking

98
00:04:49,202 --> 00:04:51,464
at some of the best cards at various mana costs.

99
00:04:52,224 --> 00:04:56,168
Dr. Boom, probably one of the best 7 cost cards ever made in Hearthstone.

100
00:04:56,628 --> 00:05:01,452
However, that card is better than Loatheb, which is probably one of the best 5 cost cards

101
00:05:01,492 --> 00:05:05,816
ever made in Hearthstone, and Annoy-a-Tron, which has been just ubiquitous while it was

102
00:05:05,876 --> 00:05:08,579
legal in the standard format in Hearthstone.

103
00:05:09,159 --> 00:05:14,664
And one of the easiest ways to look at that is if Dr. Boom were to block Loatheb, it would

104
00:05:14,704 --> 00:05:15,785
still be threatening 7 damage.

105
00:05:16,886 --> 00:05:20,047
So even though it has taken out that five cost card,

106
00:05:20,087 --> 00:05:21,848
it doesn't go down in its value.

107
00:05:22,168 --> 00:05:23,908
Plus it's got the boom bots going on.

108
00:05:24,269 --> 00:05:28,170
So you actually get more at seven than just five plus two.

109
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:30,991
And that comes into a lot of reasons

110
00:05:31,091 --> 00:05:34,392
and ends up giving us what looks more like a curve.

111
00:05:34,952 --> 00:05:37,293
As you increase the cost, you get more power,

112
00:05:37,333 --> 00:05:39,634
but it isn't a linear amount of power increase.

113
00:05:40,074 --> 00:05:42,035
The amount of power you get at each cost point

114
00:05:42,535 --> 00:05:44,496
goes up a bit more curvy.

115
00:05:47,798 --> 00:05:49,618
The reason that they're more than power lines

116
00:05:49,878 --> 00:05:51,799
is expensive cards have to be better than cards

117
00:05:51,819 --> 00:05:52,799
that add up to their cost.

118
00:05:53,319 --> 00:05:56,440
For example, the game could end before you even get to seven,

119
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,860
so you might never even be able to play Dr. Boom.

120
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:00,721
So that means that if you make it

121
00:06:00,741 --> 00:06:02,861
to that depth of point in a game,

122
00:06:02,921 --> 00:06:04,702
as you get that many resources, you

123
00:06:04,742 --> 00:06:07,322
have to have sufficient payoff for waiting

124
00:06:07,362 --> 00:06:08,603
that long to play that card.

125
00:06:09,123 --> 00:06:11,323
The more expensive a card is, the less flexible it is.

126
00:06:11,443 --> 00:06:14,804
You can't play Dr. Boom before turn seven in a normal game.

127
00:06:15,184 --> 00:06:17,165
However, too-cost card like.

128
00:06:18,546 --> 00:06:22,871
the golem, you can play at any time that you have at least two mana.

129
00:06:23,351 --> 00:06:27,476
And if you come to a turn later on in the game where you have perhaps five or six mana,

130
00:06:27,796 --> 00:06:29,358
you can play that with other cards.

131
00:06:29,378 --> 00:06:34,444
And that's also one of the great reasons that Hearthstone has the hero power, is it helps

132
00:06:34,504 --> 00:06:35,545
smooth out your mana curve.

133
00:06:35,965 --> 00:06:38,586
At any time, if you've played, if you're on turn six,

134
00:06:38,686 --> 00:06:40,627
you play a four cost turn, you've got two left over,

135
00:06:41,027 --> 00:06:42,668
you can hit your hero power button,

136
00:06:43,008 --> 00:06:44,568
and that will help you smooth out

137
00:06:44,648 --> 00:06:46,489
and use all of your resources every turn.

138
00:06:46,809 --> 00:06:48,950
The similar thing with the Annoy-o-Tron there,

139
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:51,231
you can play that extra two at any point

140
00:06:51,271 --> 00:06:53,712
that you have that much leftover mana.

141
00:06:54,252 --> 00:06:56,033
So the cheaper a card is,

142
00:06:56,233 --> 00:06:58,153
the easier it is to play at any point of the game,

143
00:06:58,233 --> 00:07:00,554
and why you don't need as much payoff for that card,

144
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:03,255
and why you have to linearly, non-linearly,

145
00:07:03,315 --> 00:07:05,436
curve up your power as you go up in cost.

146
00:07:07,339 --> 00:07:11,122
And this gets into the point of additional power at each cost.

147
00:07:11,722 --> 00:07:15,065
Here are two pretty standard cards, War Golem and Rivercroc.

148
00:07:15,866 --> 00:07:22,510
And Rivercroc has an equivalent card that is, clearly, just a bit better than Rivercroc.

149
00:07:22,971 --> 00:07:26,794
Flame Juggler is the exact same stats for the exact same mana cost.

150
00:07:27,214 --> 00:07:30,296
However, you also get to deal one damage to a random enemy.

151
00:07:30,877 --> 00:07:34,838
You could make flame juggling war golem and make exactly war

152
00:07:34,858 --> 00:07:39,379
golem stats and give it that same same ability. However, that

153
00:07:39,519 --> 00:07:43,200
war golem with the special ability is not as much better

154
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,960
than flame juggler is. And this is where we start getting into

155
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,621
weird terminology things and why you can't just say a card is

156
00:07:49,661 --> 00:07:53,382
more powerful than another card. And what I'm trying to get

157
00:07:53,442 --> 00:07:56,523
across here starts to get a little complicated. And we're

158
00:07:56,563 --> 00:07:58,743
going to try to show it on this cool chart here.

159
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:03,635
how good a card is depends on the ratio

160
00:08:03,815 --> 00:08:05,856
of how far off the curve it is.

161
00:08:06,516 --> 00:08:08,357
So these two cards can be put up,

162
00:08:08,757 --> 00:08:10,538
these are the base cards with no stats,

163
00:08:10,998 --> 00:08:12,618
can be put up on the curve here,

164
00:08:12,958 --> 00:08:15,139
and when we add Flame Juggler, it is

165
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,442
just that little red mark up off the curve,

166
00:08:18,842 --> 00:08:20,263
whereas the Flame Juggler and War Golem

167
00:08:20,403 --> 00:08:22,545
is also that same little red mark off the curve.

168
00:08:22,965 --> 00:08:26,608
But the Flame Juggler is way better

169
00:08:26,768 --> 00:08:28,029
than Flame Juggler, War Golem,

170
00:08:28,409 --> 00:08:30,751
because moving that much off the curve at two

171
00:08:30,931 --> 00:08:32,413
is worth way more than moving

172
00:08:32,453 --> 00:08:33,894
that much off the curve at seven.

173
00:08:34,474 --> 00:08:37,016
To make a card that is that much better than War Golem,

174
00:08:37,036 --> 00:08:40,119
you have to do something like Prophet Velen or Doctor Boom

175
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:43,822
to be that more impressive at the same cost.

176
00:08:44,602 --> 00:08:50,870
And that ratio is kind of the thing that we really need to look at at all times when you're

177
00:08:50,890 --> 00:08:55,736
talking about how good a card is and why power isn't just a good enough word, because War

178
00:08:55,756 --> 00:09:00,281
Golem is a more powerful card than Flame Juggler, but it's probably a much worse card than Flame

179
00:09:00,321 --> 00:09:00,621
Juggler.

180
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:06,364
And so we've been always trying to come up with good terminology for that ratio.

181
00:09:07,264 --> 00:09:09,445
Me and a friend of mine used to call it Jedi.

182
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,906
That's probably a little too trademarky to get around.

183
00:09:13,166 --> 00:09:16,567
Extra Credits did an episode where they had talked to us about that

184
00:09:17,067 --> 00:09:21,469
and said something about that being like an official term that we'd used at Wizards.

185
00:09:21,509 --> 00:09:24,010
It was just something that we had kind of kicked around at one point.

186
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,531
I've been thinking of trying to come up with a neat name,

187
00:09:26,571 --> 00:09:27,851
maybe Marx or something for it.

188
00:09:29,592 --> 00:09:32,314
Anyway, moving on, we can see our flame juggling

189
00:09:32,334 --> 00:09:35,577
war golem just does not really stack up with

190
00:09:35,597 --> 00:09:38,740
those other cards there. And so that, that's why

191
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,042
the ratio is so much more important than the

192
00:09:42,222 --> 00:09:44,804
actual, like, scalar of how much extra power you're

193
00:09:44,824 --> 00:09:46,225
getting when you're balancing a card.

194
00:09:49,282 --> 00:09:53,187
So when we're going to look at other games, you get to get into different cost structures.

195
00:09:53,307 --> 00:10:00,075
And those cost structures have a circular informing of both the cost and the balancing

196
00:10:00,095 --> 00:10:01,837
of those individual objects within the game.

197
00:10:02,477 --> 00:10:07,043
In a Hearthstone card, the only thing that you can really do to make the cost any different

198
00:10:07,083 --> 00:10:09,626
is put it in a class versus have it be a neutral card.

199
00:10:10,106 --> 00:10:13,369
That second card, Druid of the Claw, can only be played in a golem deck,

200
00:10:13,569 --> 00:10:15,451
but otherwise they just both cost five.

201
00:10:16,052 --> 00:10:18,093
But when you get into Magic the Gathering,

202
00:10:18,133 --> 00:10:20,356
they have a far more complex mana system.

203
00:10:20,896 --> 00:10:22,057
If you're not familiar with it,

204
00:10:22,337 --> 00:10:25,740
up in that upper right corner is the cost for those two cards,

205
00:10:25,861 --> 00:10:27,082
Tidings and Sliver Queen.

206
00:10:27,622 --> 00:10:31,166
Both of them have a converted mana cost, or total cost, of five,

207
00:10:31,306 --> 00:10:33,007
just like Loatheb and Druid of the Claw.

208
00:10:33,748 --> 00:10:39,011
But Tidings requires 3 of any mana and then 2 specifically blue mana to play.

209
00:10:39,391 --> 00:10:42,833
Where Sliver Queen requires 1 of 5 different colors to play.

210
00:10:43,533 --> 00:10:45,655
And that is far more difficult to do.

211
00:10:46,195 --> 00:10:52,439
So Sliver Queen, in terms of raw power, is just more bang for your buck than Tidings

212
00:10:52,619 --> 00:10:56,921
because its 5 is a much harder 5 than Tidings is.

213
00:10:59,102 --> 00:11:02,985
that actually gives magic way more granularity in their costs.

214
00:11:03,345 --> 00:11:06,427
Whereas at Hearthstone, everything that costs five, costs five.

215
00:11:06,868 --> 00:11:08,449
Magic can actually do a—

216
00:11:08,949 --> 00:11:11,391
there are lots of, like, essentially decimals

217
00:11:11,931 --> 00:11:15,333
in the cost that they're able to do for balancing cards.

218
00:11:15,633 --> 00:11:17,715
And that gives them an extra knob to turn.

219
00:11:18,155 --> 00:11:19,856
Tidings you can make slightly better

220
00:11:20,016 --> 00:11:22,278
and then just make the mana cost have more blue in it.

221
00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:24,399
Or they could have it do an additional effect

222
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:25,900
and put a different color of mana in it.

223
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,082
That makes the card harder to play,

224
00:11:28,522 --> 00:11:30,403
but it gives you more knobs to turn

225
00:11:30,443 --> 00:11:31,804
when you're balancing things like that.

226
00:11:33,585 --> 00:11:37,087
And that also starts to get into how the power curves

227
00:11:37,147 --> 00:11:39,269
are different for these games.

228
00:11:40,009 --> 00:11:44,412
Because in Hearthstone, you generate a mana every turn,

229
00:11:44,552 --> 00:11:46,193
and there's no resource that you have to play

230
00:11:46,233 --> 00:11:47,134
out of your hand to do that.

231
00:11:47,514 --> 00:11:50,496
Whereas in Magic, you do not get a mana every turn.

232
00:11:50,656 --> 00:11:52,697
You can get a maximum of one mana every turn.

233
00:11:53,177 --> 00:11:56,379
but you have to play a card from your hand and it relies on you drawing that.

234
00:11:56,859 --> 00:12:03,862
That means that in Hearthstone, Hearthstone needs to bribe you with more power to play low-cost cards.

235
00:12:04,642 --> 00:12:09,424
A one-cost card in Hearthstone relatively is more powerful than a one-cost card in Magic.

236
00:12:10,084 --> 00:12:13,045
These up here are maybe a year or two old at this point,

237
00:12:13,085 --> 00:12:16,066
but some very popular one-cost cards in the Associated Games.

238
00:12:16,607 --> 00:12:19,368
Tunnel Trog was a beast when it came out

239
00:12:19,468 --> 00:12:23,149
and was the cornerstone of many powerful shaman decks.

240
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:25,650
Northshire Cleric to this day is played

241
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:26,610
in a ton of Cleric decks.

242
00:12:26,710 --> 00:12:29,111
It is a ton of power at one-cost cards.

243
00:12:29,592 --> 00:12:32,493
Whereas you look at Expedition Envoy and Annoying Turf Champions,

244
00:12:32,833 --> 00:12:37,095
these are pretty basic cards that do little to nothing and just have stats on them,

245
00:12:37,315 --> 00:12:40,356
but they were considered solid cards in the Magic decks they were played in

246
00:12:40,776 --> 00:12:46,579
because they only cost one and you need that flexibility more in Magic than you do in Hearthstone.

247
00:12:47,039 --> 00:12:51,181
If you wait a turn or two in Hearthstone, you will always be able to play your more expensive card,

248
00:12:51,421 --> 00:12:54,782
whereas in Magic, your curve does not go up automatically,

249
00:12:54,842 --> 00:12:57,403
so you need to make sure that you have cards that you can always play.

250
00:12:57,804 --> 00:13:00,016
when you haven't drawn up to your specific mana point.

251
00:13:01,263 --> 00:13:05,764
Conversely, because of that, Magic's cards at higher costs

252
00:13:05,804 --> 00:13:08,625
give way more power than Hearthstone's cards

253
00:13:08,665 --> 00:13:09,746
at those similar costs.

254
00:13:11,146 --> 00:13:13,087
Piloted Sky Golem, Emperor Therosian,

255
00:13:13,327 --> 00:13:16,388
both really powerful six-cost cards in Hearthstone,

256
00:13:16,848 --> 00:13:20,129
but the associated white cards from that same era,

257
00:13:20,549 --> 00:13:22,930
the Subjugator Angel and the Llanvala the Preserver,

258
00:13:23,310 --> 00:13:25,851
Subjugator Angels can just end games when you play it,

259
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:28,072
and Llanvala is one of the biggest comeback cards

260
00:13:28,112 --> 00:13:30,293
that's been printed in Magic that's viable.

261
00:13:30,873 --> 00:13:35,677
These cards just have tremendous amounts of power because by time you hit six in Magic,

262
00:13:36,097 --> 00:13:39,960
that is usually a much later point in the game compared to Hearthstone.

263
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:44,763
You're probably talking turn eight at the minimum, if not like turn ten or something.

264
00:13:45,304 --> 00:13:48,646
So as you get up there, you need more and more power.

265
00:13:49,167 --> 00:13:51,649
You get more and more power payoff from Magic

266
00:13:52,049 --> 00:13:56,152
because they have to bribe you to bring you along to convince you to play higher cost cards

267
00:13:56,232 --> 00:13:58,814
because it is hard for the game to go that long in Magic.

268
00:14:00,014 --> 00:14:02,537
So that gives us two different looking power curves,

269
00:14:02,938 --> 00:14:05,201
and this isn't super great here.

270
00:14:05,421 --> 00:14:06,723
These are not official or anything.

271
00:14:06,783 --> 00:14:08,385
These are basic estimates here.

272
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:12,390
But Hearthstone's power curve is higher at the low end,

273
00:14:12,470 --> 00:14:15,354
but Magic's outpaces it pretty sharply as you go along.

274
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:20,052
So on Magic, your sixth turn is not likely

275
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:21,273
to give you a six cost card.

276
00:14:21,453 --> 00:14:24,116
Higher mana cost require more mana commitment in your deck,

277
00:14:24,556 --> 00:14:26,158
and Magic needs to bribe players more

278
00:14:26,218 --> 00:14:27,819
to play their expensive cards,

279
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:29,861
and they get more granularity with their mana system.

280
00:14:30,402 --> 00:14:32,123
Hearthstone, one mana every turn,

281
00:14:32,243 --> 00:14:34,065
your deck doesn't need any mana support in it,

282
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,167
and it needs to bribe you to play low cards,

283
00:14:36,187 --> 00:14:37,268
because if you just wait around,

284
00:14:37,308 --> 00:14:40,151
you're always gonna get to play your more expensive card.

285
00:14:40,671 --> 00:14:42,273
More expensive card, excuse me.

286
00:14:43,875 --> 00:14:47,183
And then some games have some really weird curves,

287
00:14:47,704 --> 00:14:48,366
like Pokemon.

288
00:14:49,357 --> 00:14:52,259
The cost in a Pokemon card is the stage.

289
00:14:52,339 --> 00:14:53,760
These are all basic Pokemon.

290
00:14:53,801 --> 00:14:55,862
These are the Pokemon that you can put directly into play.

291
00:14:56,343 --> 00:14:57,884
Lapras, Pikachu, and Froakie.

292
00:14:58,324 --> 00:15:01,227
However, as we all know, you can evolve Pokemon,

293
00:15:01,687 --> 00:15:03,609
and you can evolve that Pikachu into a Raichu,

294
00:15:03,749 --> 00:15:05,170
and that Froakie into a Frogadier,

295
00:15:05,551 --> 00:15:08,773
and that Frogadier can evolve even further into a Greninja.

296
00:15:09,174 --> 00:15:12,817
So there are these three points of cost

297
00:15:13,037 --> 00:15:14,078
in Pokemon that you can get.

298
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:21,983
But then there are even more powerful cards in Pokemon called EX and GX cards.

299
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:26,565
And these cards are basic, but as you can see, if you just look at the hit points on

300
00:15:26,585 --> 00:15:31,128
those cards in the top right corner, Darkrai and Groudon have significantly more than even

301
00:15:31,168 --> 00:15:32,688
the stage two card Greninja.

302
00:15:33,069 --> 00:15:37,931
And the damage that they do, if you can see next to like Mountain Rend, is much higher

303
00:15:37,971 --> 00:15:39,852
than what Mistslash is doing on Greninja.

304
00:15:40,253 --> 00:15:43,374
And that is because they have costs that you pay on the back end.

305
00:15:43,935 --> 00:15:48,716
Pokemon, if you have not played it, is a game usually won by defeating six of your opponent's

306
00:15:48,756 --> 00:15:52,517
Pokemon, and each time you defeat an opponent's Pokemon, you get a prize card.

307
00:15:52,997 --> 00:15:55,938
When you defeat an EX Pokemon, you get two prize cards.

308
00:15:56,438 --> 00:16:01,079
However, you don't pay that cost until you have lost that resource, so you do not pay

309
00:16:01,119 --> 00:16:04,900
it going in, you pay it on the way out, and only as you're losing ground.

310
00:16:05,902 --> 00:16:08,003
And so some mega Pokemon can even evolve.

311
00:16:08,463 --> 00:16:11,444
But that gives Pokemon a really different power curve

312
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,565
compared to a lot of games.

313
00:16:12,665 --> 00:16:13,965
You get this chunky curve.

314
00:16:14,385 --> 00:16:16,406
There are very few points of granularity

315
00:16:16,446 --> 00:16:17,627
in the Pokemon power curve,

316
00:16:18,047 --> 00:16:19,688
and it varies up and down wildly

317
00:16:19,788 --> 00:16:21,969
because if you don't pay all the costs up front,

318
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:24,310
you pay some of the costs on the back end.

319
00:16:25,490 --> 00:16:27,251
So the Pokemon stage determines time.

320
00:16:27,291 --> 00:16:30,152
You have to wait a turn for each stage of evolution

321
00:16:30,192 --> 00:16:31,212
that you do in Pokemon.

322
00:16:31,733 --> 00:16:35,334
And your deck commitment, to play a stage two Pokemon,

323
00:16:35,434 --> 00:16:37,415
you need more cards committed to that Pokemon.

324
00:16:37,435 --> 00:16:39,255
If I'm going to play four EX Pokemon,

325
00:16:39,675 --> 00:16:40,596
I put those in my deck.

326
00:16:40,856 --> 00:16:43,737
If I want to play Greninja, I need four Froakies

327
00:16:43,957 --> 00:16:46,258
and four Frogadiers and four Greninjas.

328
00:16:46,658 --> 00:16:48,438
So that eats up more of your deck space,

329
00:16:48,598 --> 00:16:49,859
giving you less flexibility.

330
00:16:50,439 --> 00:16:52,840
And then the EX Pokemon give up that extra prize

331
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:53,580
on the way back.

332
00:16:55,309 --> 00:16:57,651
So Pokemon compared to Magic and Hearthstone,

333
00:16:58,331 --> 00:16:59,852
each Pokemon has to start from basic

334
00:16:59,912 --> 00:17:00,973
no matter what turn it is,

335
00:17:01,214 --> 00:17:02,515
and the time is per Pokemon,

336
00:17:02,695 --> 00:17:04,076
and it gets reset every turn.

337
00:17:04,717 --> 00:17:06,538
There's no plateauing of power

338
00:17:06,598 --> 00:17:09,841
like you would get in Magic and Hearthstone.

339
00:17:09,901 --> 00:17:11,863
You don't reach a point where just huge cards

340
00:17:11,883 --> 00:17:15,346
can be played every turn, like in Magic and Hearthstone.

341
00:17:15,606 --> 00:17:17,507
You're always starting out at the beginning

342
00:17:17,547 --> 00:17:18,468
with the same lowest card.

343
00:17:18,668 --> 00:17:20,390
So it has a very different flow to it,

344
00:17:20,550 --> 00:17:21,911
and that causes the card design

345
00:17:21,931 --> 00:17:23,753
to be very different in those two games.

346
00:17:26,133 --> 00:17:28,354
Very briefly, I'm going to talk about Clash Royale.

347
00:17:28,735 --> 00:17:30,556
It's a real-time strategy game, but it still

348
00:17:30,596 --> 00:17:32,677
has a collectible object element to it.

349
00:17:33,918 --> 00:17:36,200
Real-time strategy games are hard to discuss in these terms,

350
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,461
because usually it's combos, baiting,

351
00:17:38,501 --> 00:17:41,463
and reacting that tell you more about the card's power level

352
00:17:41,503 --> 00:17:41,963
in general.

353
00:17:42,524 --> 00:17:45,346
In StarCraft, Banelings are not something

354
00:17:45,386 --> 00:17:47,387
you're just going to build if you're playing Zerg.

355
00:17:47,807 --> 00:17:52,110
But if they've got a lot of Marines, maybe you should make a Bane Leader too to start going in that direction.

356
00:17:52,751 --> 00:17:56,673
In Clash Royale, Skeletons for one cost are not a great card.

357
00:17:56,693 --> 00:18:02,717
They don't, it's not going to be a central part of your strategy, but you use it to distract other cards that your opponent has played.

358
00:18:03,358 --> 00:18:06,439
And this gives a whole other different mana system compared to

359
00:18:07,299 --> 00:18:11,381
Magic Hearthstone or Pokemon that really doing a power curve almost makes

360
00:18:11,621 --> 00:18:15,482
less sense because it is in a constant rise and fall of power.

361
00:18:16,102 --> 00:18:19,183
You are constantly building up a power reserve that you expend

362
00:18:19,624 --> 00:18:23,685
when you play those cards, thus reducing how much you have at that time, but it is

363
00:18:23,845 --> 00:18:28,187
constantly building, give you a rise and fall and that happens within that.

364
00:18:30,367 --> 00:18:30,888
And that...

365
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:37,260
is briefly and very quickly a general discussion

366
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,261
of power curves.

367
00:18:39,341 --> 00:18:41,502
If you have, want the questions or the slides,

368
00:18:41,582 --> 00:18:43,343
they will be in the vault at some point.

369
00:18:43,643 --> 00:18:45,544
Again, this is my contact information.

370
00:18:46,204 --> 00:18:48,985
If there are any questions, we do have a microphone here.

371
00:18:49,045 --> 00:18:52,607
I think we've got about two-ish minutes left,

372
00:18:52,927 --> 00:18:54,488
if I'm not mistaken, maybe 10-ish.

373
00:18:55,939 --> 00:18:57,881
10-ish, we got about 10-ish minutes left,

374
00:18:58,122 --> 00:18:59,804
so I did blow through that pretty quickly.

375
00:18:59,824 --> 00:19:02,707
So yeah, so if we have some questions,

376
00:19:02,727 --> 00:19:03,628
there's a microphone right there,

377
00:19:03,748 --> 00:19:04,849
and then when we are done,

378
00:19:04,869 --> 00:19:07,532
I will go to the overflow zone over there.

379
00:19:08,253 --> 00:19:10,796
Make sure that you fill out your evaluations

380
00:19:10,836 --> 00:19:12,317
that you'll be getting for this talk.

381
00:19:12,578 --> 00:19:13,919
We'll ask you your favorite number.

382
00:19:14,219 --> 00:19:15,301
Your favorite number's five.

383
00:19:18,301 --> 00:19:21,702
Hi, so a question is about Power Creep.

384
00:19:22,782 --> 00:19:25,663
When we were developing a game, if it's a new game,

385
00:19:26,503 --> 00:19:28,064
that won't come up very often.

386
00:19:28,724 --> 00:19:33,005
But an older game like Magic, Hearthstone, or Pokemon,

387
00:19:33,765 --> 00:19:37,846
eventually you print cards that are just better, strictly

388
00:19:37,886 --> 00:19:39,266
better than previous cards.

389
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:43,588
When, as a designer, when is it OK to do that?

390
00:19:45,008 --> 00:19:46,348
Why does it come out so often?

391
00:19:47,748 --> 00:19:47,928
Why?

392
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,189
Well, a lot of that depends on the game

393
00:19:50,209 --> 00:19:52,331
and the philosophy that they have behind the game.

394
00:19:53,531 --> 00:19:56,774
For example, in Magic, some of the most powerful cards ever

395
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,435
were printed in the first set, and there

396
00:19:58,455 --> 00:20:01,016
are cards that will never equal the power level of those cards.

397
00:20:01,837 --> 00:20:04,078
But there are cards that get printed in Magic that are just

398
00:20:04,118 --> 00:20:06,320
better, sometimes even within the same set.

399
00:20:08,537 --> 00:20:14,539
what happens there a lot of the time, and that comes into doing rotation within your

400
00:20:14,619 --> 00:20:19,240
collectible object game. Hearthstone does it, Pokemon does it, Magic does it, but not every

401
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:25,382
game does do that. And with rotation, you are always able to take chunks out of the

402
00:20:25,422 --> 00:20:29,763
game and always have this newer section of elements that are in the game.

403
00:20:30,683 --> 00:20:32,903
By doing that, you're going to be able to hit different points.

404
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:36,545
Like, I forget it right now, in Hearthstone,

405
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,905
when the mech set came out, there was the vanilla 3-4-4-3

406
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:42,506
that came out, and that card just didn't exist.

407
00:20:42,606 --> 00:20:45,487
And now that card is left, and now there is no 3-4-4-3.

408
00:20:45,967 --> 00:20:48,268
So it allows you to have different holes

409
00:20:48,328 --> 00:20:49,988
to make players make interesting decisions.

410
00:20:50,769 --> 00:20:55,773
Magma Rager was of course like the 5-1 for 3, I think.

411
00:20:56,313 --> 00:20:58,875
And it was always kind of a joke card.

412
00:20:58,975 --> 00:21:02,278
Like even in fiction, they made jokes about how bad Magma

413
00:21:02,298 --> 00:21:02,738
Rager was.

414
00:21:03,059 --> 00:21:04,700
And eventually, they printed the 5-2 at

415
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:05,801
that same exact cost.

416
00:21:06,221 --> 00:21:08,503
So sometimes by looking at your curves and seeing what

417
00:21:08,543 --> 00:21:10,765
cards are and aren't being played, yeah, you're going to

418
00:21:10,805 --> 00:21:12,266
occasionally print some cards that are

419
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,227
strictly better than that.

420
00:21:13,607 --> 00:21:16,470
And sometimes you'll learn over time that your granularity

421
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:17,351
has been off.

422
00:21:18,451 --> 00:21:21,513
Small numbers are incredibly dangerous in card games,

423
00:21:22,094 --> 00:21:25,416
and Pokemon did kind of a rebalancing, I'm gonna say,

424
00:21:25,536 --> 00:21:27,317
eight years ago with the black and white set,

425
00:21:27,937 --> 00:21:31,159
where the smallest number in the game was often one.

426
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:33,721
And that is a very dangerous number,

427
00:21:34,221 --> 00:21:36,843
because the next number you can go to is two,

428
00:21:37,183 --> 00:21:38,684
which is twice as big.

429
00:21:39,344 --> 00:21:44,250
And so it's very hard to make a small adjustment to the number one because you can either completely get rid of it

430
00:21:44,790 --> 00:21:49,556
or move it to that. So they boosted the base hp of a lot of things and upped the base damage of a lot of

431
00:21:49,596 --> 00:21:51,518
things and now there's kind of this new normal

432
00:21:52,099 --> 00:21:59,507
in pokemon, but I don't but as if you look over like the sun moon series, it's not significantly higher compared to the xy series.

433
00:22:00,168 --> 00:22:07,171
So it's just a lot of things going there, but some games actually just do it as a sales mechanism

434
00:22:07,571 --> 00:22:13,634
where they just constantly creep it up and up and up because it's a lot sometimes it's because the

435
00:22:13,674 --> 00:22:19,577
design space isn't that big. Like Magic, Pokemon Hearthstone, there's a lot of design space in

436
00:22:19,617 --> 00:22:24,979
those games, but some games just don't have that design space. So to keep people interested in

437
00:22:25,379 --> 00:22:27,000
buying the new boosters or whatever.

438
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:28,821
they do have to do that.

439
00:22:29,021 --> 00:22:32,022
But usually rotation means that it's never,

440
00:22:32,162 --> 00:22:34,602
it's just, well sure, I mean like Dr. Boom, right?

441
00:22:34,682 --> 00:22:37,383
Dr. Boom was the card in Hearthstone for a very long time.

442
00:22:37,423 --> 00:22:39,304
But now it's just not legal in standard play.

443
00:22:39,784 --> 00:22:42,745
So it allows them to do those resets and take chances.

444
00:22:43,245 --> 00:22:45,625
Right, if they never print something as good as that,

445
00:22:45,805 --> 00:22:47,306
if they are never printing cards

446
00:22:47,326 --> 00:22:48,166
that they have to pull back,

447
00:22:48,206 --> 00:22:50,347
they're probably not pushing hard enough.

448
00:22:50,847 --> 00:22:53,328
And so there's always a balance there of,

449
00:22:54,229 --> 00:22:56,116
how powerful do we make this card?

450
00:22:56,477 --> 00:22:58,725
So yeah, it can be complicated.

451
00:22:59,207 --> 00:22:59,388
Thank you.

452
00:23:02,211 --> 00:23:08,775
Hi, so you touched a little bit in that answer about granularity and the fact that it's one

453
00:23:08,795 --> 00:23:12,297
or two or three and you can't go in between those too much.

454
00:23:12,357 --> 00:23:18,841
But in miniatures games like Warhammer, War Machine, stuff like that, the costs are much

455
00:23:18,921 --> 00:23:19,762
more granular.

456
00:23:19,822 --> 00:23:22,684
In Warhammer there will be 132 points for this vehicle and 130 points for this other

457
00:23:22,724 --> 00:23:23,044
vehicle.

458
00:23:25,745 --> 00:23:30,589
Does that granularity, would that help War to balance in card games like this?

459
00:23:30,709 --> 00:23:34,131
Or is it just sort of a false sense of confidence?

460
00:23:34,372 --> 00:23:37,674
It's a different resource that you're balancing at that point, right?

461
00:23:37,754 --> 00:23:42,958
Because usually in a miniatures game like Warhammer, if I have a 132 point orc tank,

462
00:23:43,358 --> 00:23:45,280
I don't have to wait till I get to the 132...

463
00:23:46,621 --> 00:23:49,383
points in the game to be able to put my orc tank out,

464
00:23:49,843 --> 00:23:55,187
that's just in my army. And it's a summation so that your total army has an equivalent power to this total army

465
00:23:55,267 --> 00:23:57,108
that you're, that you're likely to be facing.

466
00:23:57,729 --> 00:24:00,311
But you're gonna start with all of that in play at one time.

467
00:24:00,811 --> 00:24:04,414
So some games do, some collectible object games do do something like that.

468
00:24:04,434 --> 00:24:07,776
They'll like put stars on cards and say you can have seven stars in your deck.

469
00:24:08,257 --> 00:24:12,622
and those will usually be like more powerful cards in the game and they try to balance

470
00:24:12,662 --> 00:24:13,163
it off that.

471
00:24:13,603 --> 00:24:19,250
But it is a different system that you're looking at with miniatures, but those do give a lot

472
00:24:19,270 --> 00:24:24,557
of granularity and since the numbers usually are much higher on that, that is a deck construction

473
00:24:24,617 --> 00:24:25,038
versus a...

474
00:24:26,339 --> 00:24:29,342
object playing scheme that you're talking about there.

475
00:24:29,362 --> 00:24:32,604
And yeah, that does turn it on its head a little bit.

476
00:24:32,925 --> 00:24:34,566
But that granularity is very nice

477
00:24:34,666 --> 00:24:37,108
because those numbers are usually so high

478
00:24:37,168 --> 00:24:38,389
and give you enough granularity

479
00:24:38,729 --> 00:24:40,951
that you can always just like make a unit

480
00:24:41,171 --> 00:24:42,793
however you think it needs to be

481
00:24:42,833 --> 00:24:43,974
if it's something in fiction.

482
00:24:43,994 --> 00:24:46,536
This is the Org General, he needs to be able to do this.

483
00:24:46,956 --> 00:24:48,557
You can always just tweak that number

484
00:24:48,598 --> 00:24:50,079
plus or minus one a lot.

485
00:24:50,579 --> 00:24:52,661
until you find the place that it finds out.

486
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,465
And a lot of time those costs are set to either encourage

487
00:24:55,505 --> 00:24:57,347
or discourage combos from existing

488
00:24:57,787 --> 00:24:58,888
within those games as well.

489
00:24:58,908 --> 00:25:00,190
Thank you.

490
00:25:02,322 --> 00:25:05,104
So you spoke about Hearthstone and you spoke about Magic.

491
00:25:05,444 --> 00:25:08,587
And in one you have a constant resource generation that's going up every turn.

492
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:11,529
In the other you're looking for specific resource generators.

493
00:25:11,970 --> 00:25:16,513
I don't know if you're familiar with the original Warcraft card game

494
00:25:16,553 --> 00:25:19,216
that was the precursor basically to Hearthstone.

495
00:25:19,796 --> 00:25:22,298
In that there was a mechanic where you could take any card from your hand

496
00:25:22,338 --> 00:25:23,759
and actually play that as a resource.

497
00:25:24,340 --> 00:25:26,642
Where do you think that falls among those power curves?

498
00:25:26,662 --> 00:25:28,243
Do you think that's kind of in between the two?

499
00:25:28,363 --> 00:25:29,464
Or what is your opinion on that?

500
00:25:30,218 --> 00:25:32,759
The question is about the original Hearthstone card game

501
00:25:33,480 --> 00:25:35,561
and its similarity and differences,

502
00:25:35,581 --> 00:25:37,802
or the original Warcraft card game

503
00:25:37,862 --> 00:25:39,903
and its similarity and differences to both Magic

504
00:25:39,963 --> 00:25:41,264
and Hearthstone's mana system.

505
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:44,046
You can take any card from your hand and play that as a resource.

506
00:25:44,486 --> 00:25:46,827
And in a way it is closer to Magic

507
00:25:46,907 --> 00:25:49,529
because you have to give up a card resource from your turn

508
00:25:50,189 --> 00:25:53,651
and to be able to play that as a mana card,

509
00:25:53,691 --> 00:25:55,912
I think is what they were called, I forget at this point.

510
00:25:57,193 --> 00:25:59,815
So it is a little similar to that, but again there is no typing.

511
00:26:00,416 --> 00:26:03,678
And that is where Magic gets a lot of its actual granularity,

512
00:26:03,698 --> 00:26:05,480
it comes from the different colors of Magic.

513
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:09,203
And that also gives them ability to make very powerful cards

514
00:26:09,263 --> 00:26:12,826
that just is hard for you to meet in the same deck.

515
00:26:13,546 --> 00:26:15,288
So that's where a lot of that comes from.

516
00:26:15,328 --> 00:26:17,069
But yeah, it is probably closer to...

517
00:26:18,190 --> 00:26:21,873
to Hearthstone still, because if you ever really wanted to,

518
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:23,735
you could play a card from your hand to become that,

519
00:26:24,136 --> 00:26:26,338
but you would eventually run out of hand resources

520
00:26:26,418 --> 00:26:27,499
if you did that every turn.

521
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,822
But yeah, it's probably still closer to Hearthstone,

522
00:26:30,962 --> 00:26:33,325
but not, but it is still off from,

523
00:26:33,445 --> 00:26:35,407
it's still probably in between Hearthstone and Magic,

524
00:26:35,807 --> 00:26:37,168
but it's probably closer to Hearthstone.

525
00:26:37,188 --> 00:26:37,669
All right, thank you.

526
00:26:37,869 --> 00:26:38,069
Yeah.

527
00:26:40,391 --> 00:26:40,552
Hello.

528
00:26:41,535 --> 00:26:44,796
So I've played Hearthstone, Pokemon, and Magic for years now,

529
00:26:45,516 --> 00:26:47,996
and I'm seeing them through many different iterations.

530
00:26:49,357 --> 00:26:52,237
Do you think that it's healthy to have cards that are so far off the power curve

531
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:54,438
that they create a metaphor of the game?

532
00:26:55,098 --> 00:26:56,458
Designing it preemptively, of course.

533
00:26:57,179 --> 00:27:01,019
And looking specifically at Shaymini, Pokemon example,

534
00:27:01,440 --> 00:27:04,340
or Hearthstone as well, like Dr. Boom, Shaymini X,

535
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,961
Zoroark GX, and Tapu Lele.

536
00:27:09,001 --> 00:27:09,421
Tapu Lele.

537
00:27:10,843 --> 00:27:18,106
Uh, Pokemon tends to have a lot, because Pokemon is a very similar to Hearthstone, there's

538
00:27:18,166 --> 00:27:25,308
another IP going on at the time, and where Magic gets to kind of set its own IP within

539
00:27:25,389 --> 00:27:29,170
itself, like they want to make a good Jace, they make a good Jace, because it makes sense.

540
00:27:29,590 --> 00:27:34,552
Whereas Pokemon will have kind of pressures coming from different angles, right?

541
00:27:35,012 --> 00:27:38,255
and the Tapu Guardians were very important in the video games,

542
00:27:38,576 --> 00:27:42,179
and so that is something that we wanted to push within the Pokémon card game.

543
00:27:42,479 --> 00:27:43,581
So you'll get something like that.

544
00:27:43,921 --> 00:27:47,624
And usually with Pokémon, you will see that those cards are more of

545
00:27:48,365 --> 00:27:52,189
engine cards than combat cards, with, like, Shaman.

546
00:27:52,549 --> 00:27:55,392
Although Tapu Lele is a decent attacker as well.

547
00:27:55,792 --> 00:27:59,796
So it's interesting that a lot of games that have a more...

548
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:06,161
varied IP tie will tend to do that for brand reasons almost more than like

549
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:10,425
gameplay reasons but the game also is like played around that you know even

550
00:28:10,465 --> 00:28:13,807
when top of lately first came out very few decks were focused around it it's

551
00:28:13,848 --> 00:28:18,812
still a utility card in a lot of games so yeah having specific cards that skew

552
00:28:18,832 --> 00:28:21,494
the skew themselves around the meta I think is going to happen in various

553
00:28:21,514 --> 00:28:22,915
games it's happened in every game

554
00:28:23,575 --> 00:28:28,457
right, and cards have to either get controlled or counters come up or counter strategies

555
00:28:28,497 --> 00:28:30,358
come around it if something becomes very dominant.

556
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:35,219
Just following up on that, do you think it's also because of the chunky balance curve that

557
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:35,779
Pokemon presents?

558
00:28:35,799 --> 00:28:38,920
The chunky balance curve in Pokemon does have a great deal to do with it because there's

559
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,101
so little granularity.

560
00:28:40,261 --> 00:28:45,923
It is tough to make like a basic GX that is in one direction or the other without like

561
00:28:45,963 --> 00:28:48,884
the HP is maybe your biggest dial that you can really do with that.

562
00:28:50,044 --> 00:28:50,324
Thank you.

563
00:28:50,484 --> 00:28:50,644
Mm-hmm.

564
00:28:52,944 --> 00:28:54,105
This is our last one, I think.

565
00:28:54,145 --> 00:28:54,465
Go ahead.

566
00:28:54,485 --> 00:28:55,066
Cool.

567
00:28:55,606 --> 00:28:59,269
So when you're developing the cards, and you have your cost,

568
00:28:59,489 --> 00:29:00,950
and you're trying to plot it on the curve,

569
00:29:01,410 --> 00:29:03,732
can you accurately, before you release the game,

570
00:29:03,752 --> 00:29:05,153
maybe through play testing, determine

571
00:29:05,553 --> 00:29:07,555
where that actually falls into ratio?

572
00:29:07,675 --> 00:29:09,396
Or is that something that evolves in the metagame?

573
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,457
The question is, can you accurately

574
00:29:11,517 --> 00:29:13,439
predict where on a power curve an individual card

575
00:29:13,479 --> 00:29:14,159
is going to fall?

576
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:16,281
And the answer is, usually.

577
00:29:19,110 --> 00:29:23,091
A lot of times, I mean, as game designers, that's our job.

578
00:29:23,531 --> 00:29:27,512
And we usually are, you know, you'll, I think Gavin just

579
00:29:27,552 --> 00:29:30,113
posted an article today about some very famous cards in

580
00:29:30,153 --> 00:29:33,613
Magic that has the developer comments from them.

581
00:29:34,174 --> 00:29:36,094
And it's interesting to see someone saying, like, I'm

582
00:29:36,134 --> 00:29:37,394
going to push this card.

583
00:29:37,854 --> 00:29:40,435
I'm going to try to make this be an important card for this

584
00:29:40,495 --> 00:29:41,075
next format.

585
00:29:41,115 --> 00:29:42,656
Or I don't think this is very good.

586
00:29:42,676 --> 00:29:43,476
Let's see if we can bring it up.

587
00:29:43,776 --> 00:29:45,836
Or this card is not supposed to be as important.

588
00:29:45,876 --> 00:29:47,097
Let's bring it down a little bit.

589
00:29:47,557 --> 00:29:52,881
So, the idea is you're always going to know where it is, but like, even with, I mean,

590
00:29:54,142 --> 00:29:59,446
even with like, Wizards' R&D department or Pokemon's R&D department, which are probably

591
00:29:59,467 --> 00:30:05,752
in Hearthstone, right, those are probably some of the most focused R&D cost balance

592
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,134
houses on the planet, but that's not as good as...

593
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,476
100,000 people playing 10 million games, right?

594
00:30:12,516 --> 00:30:15,757
They're never gonna hit every single combination in there,

595
00:30:16,177 --> 00:30:17,978
and just stuff is gonna slip through,

596
00:30:18,098 --> 00:30:19,979
and it's just not everything is gonna be there,

597
00:30:19,999 --> 00:30:22,340
because the power of collectible object games,

598
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:25,201
why they're so fun, is because there literally are

599
00:30:25,882 --> 00:30:28,022
200,000 decks you could go build right now.

600
00:30:28,723 --> 00:30:31,824
And so, yeah, we think we know where it's gonna be,

601
00:30:32,444 --> 00:30:33,745
sometimes we're wrong, though, so.

602
00:30:35,226 --> 00:30:35,406
Yeah.

603
00:30:36,446 --> 00:30:37,767
And that's the talk.

604
00:30:37,867 --> 00:30:38,867
Thanks for coming, everybody.
