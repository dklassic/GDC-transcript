1
00:00:03,828 --> 00:00:07,570
I guess I'm going to start because I have 30 minutes

2
00:00:07,671 --> 00:00:09,271
for this talk and 150 slides.

3
00:00:09,311 --> 00:00:12,273
So let's see if I can make this work.

4
00:00:12,453 --> 00:00:13,414
So hi.

5
00:00:14,014 --> 00:00:15,435
My name is Nicolae Berbece.

6
00:00:15,455 --> 00:00:18,176
I'm from Romania, and we roll our Rs,

7
00:00:18,296 --> 00:00:19,837
and people cannot pronounce my second name.

8
00:00:20,077 --> 00:00:21,598
So I kind of became Nicolae Barbecue.

9
00:00:23,419 --> 00:00:26,401
I'm the founder of Those Awesome Guys, a small indie studio

10
00:00:26,601 --> 00:00:28,262
formed out of people from all over the world.

11
00:00:29,063 --> 00:00:32,045
We made a game called Move or Die for a player friendship

12
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:34,146
ruining game that came out last year.

13
00:00:34,166 --> 00:00:36,108
And I go to a lot of events.

14
00:00:36,428 --> 00:00:38,649
And I love talking about games because they're awesome.

15
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,611
And in order to illustrate this, I

16
00:00:41,671 --> 00:00:44,393
figured I should take a photo of all of my badges.

17
00:00:45,374 --> 00:00:47,696
And I took this photo when I started working on these slides.

18
00:00:47,896 --> 00:00:50,738
And by the time I was done, I had to take an extra photo.

19
00:00:51,798 --> 00:00:52,299
So that's cool.

20
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:56,920
And today I'm going to talk about how to showcase your game.

21
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,201
And based on that animation alone,

22
00:00:59,221 --> 00:01:01,121
you know that you should probably not trust me.

23
00:01:02,182 --> 00:01:05,403
I'm going to break this talk into three parts, before,

24
00:01:05,663 --> 00:01:06,963
during, and after the event.

25
00:01:07,603 --> 00:01:09,664
And in order to make things a bit more easier,

26
00:01:09,684 --> 00:01:13,525
I'm going to put a timer at the top of the slides telling you

27
00:01:13,665 --> 00:01:15,846
when to do what you're about to see on screen.

28
00:01:16,526 --> 00:01:18,047
because it's so much more convenient.

29
00:01:18,528 --> 00:01:20,850
So starting right off, before the event,

30
00:01:21,631 --> 00:01:24,453
the first thing you have to do is decide

31
00:01:24,493 --> 00:01:26,355
that you want to apply, decide that you want to go to an event.

32
00:01:26,815 --> 00:01:30,018
So you have a selection of events you can go to.

33
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:31,920
For example, if you want some press, you go to E3.

34
00:01:32,381 --> 00:01:34,122
If you want some players, you go to Gamescom.

35
00:01:34,302 --> 00:01:36,464
If you're interested in talking with developers,

36
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:38,166
you have GDC Steam Dev Days.

37
00:01:38,887 --> 00:01:40,768
If you have weird stuff, you should go to Amaze.

38
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:45,891
If you want to hear people in suits talk about CPM and

39
00:01:45,931 --> 00:01:48,652
retention rates and buzzwords, go to Casual Connect.

40
00:01:49,892 --> 00:01:50,653
But don't go alone.

41
00:01:50,893 --> 00:01:52,113
Tag along a group.

42
00:01:52,493 --> 00:01:56,395
And doing this is amazing, because going with a group

43
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:58,315
means the costs are lower.

44
00:01:58,476 --> 00:02:01,317
You don't have to spend time on logistics and all those

45
00:02:01,337 --> 00:02:03,577
things, all of those are taken care of by the group.

46
00:02:04,118 --> 00:02:06,478
So you have certain groups to pick from.

47
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:09,439
For example, there are curated groups like Indie Mega Booth

48
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:13,200
or The Mix, where you apply with your game

49
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:17,081
and they decide if you're worth investing into,

50
00:02:17,581 --> 00:02:18,782
and they send you to an event.

51
00:02:19,702 --> 00:02:20,102
And that's cool.

52
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:21,302
There are country groups.

53
00:02:21,743 --> 00:02:23,843
If your country has one, that's great.

54
00:02:23,943 --> 00:02:25,404
They're usually sponsored by governments.

55
00:02:25,604 --> 00:02:26,104
They're amazing.

56
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,464
Though there are weird groups where

57
00:02:29,465 --> 00:02:31,946
You can basically contact them directly, like all control

58
00:02:31,966 --> 00:02:32,806
GDC, Amaze.

59
00:02:33,526 --> 00:02:35,867
And there are entire events where

60
00:02:35,887 --> 00:02:37,348
you can talk directly with the organizers,

61
00:02:37,388 --> 00:02:38,988
like TwitchCon and so on and so forth.

62
00:02:39,449 --> 00:02:41,489
But the point is, not all of these groups

63
00:02:41,829 --> 00:02:42,870
go to all the events.

64
00:02:43,310 --> 00:02:45,011
So in order to fix that problem, I

65
00:02:45,031 --> 00:02:48,232
created this Venn diagram where you can just

66
00:02:48,372 --> 00:02:50,553
pick the event you want to go to,

67
00:02:50,633 --> 00:02:53,474
and you can see what groups go to that event in that circle.

68
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:55,584
So yeah, that's applying.

69
00:02:55,744 --> 00:02:57,065
Next up, travel and housing.

70
00:02:57,285 --> 00:03:03,970
Make sure you book your housing two days before the event

71
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,912
because you have to set up your booth

72
00:03:07,132 --> 00:03:09,654
and you think that things won't go wrong,

73
00:03:09,734 --> 00:03:10,835
but they will go wrong.

74
00:03:10,875 --> 00:03:13,437
And you will be fixing bugs on your Airbnb couch.

75
00:03:14,378 --> 00:03:17,160
And book one day after the event, like one extra day,

76
00:03:17,220 --> 00:03:18,941
so you can have some time to see the city,

77
00:03:19,241 --> 00:03:21,523
maybe catch up on potential meetings, so on.

78
00:03:23,529 --> 00:03:25,690
Book close to the event, because again, you

79
00:03:25,950 --> 00:03:28,872
don't think things will go wrong, but they will.

80
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:30,252
So you'll have to run back and forth,

81
00:03:30,392 --> 00:03:31,793
and you'll be super grateful when

82
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:36,436
you don't have to go all the way to the other side of the city.

83
00:03:36,976 --> 00:03:37,917
So that's travel and housing.

84
00:03:38,317 --> 00:03:39,197
Next up, parties.

85
00:03:39,838 --> 00:03:42,079
These are super important, and I cannot stress enough

86
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:43,480
how important these are.

87
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:46,742
Parties sell out weeks before the event,

88
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:47,462
and it's

89
00:03:48,102 --> 00:03:50,743
Really, it's a bummer, because parties

90
00:03:50,904 --> 00:03:53,745
are a great way to meet new developers in a more

91
00:03:54,005 --> 00:03:57,266
casual kind of setting that doesn't

92
00:03:57,306 --> 00:04:02,189
have this sterile game developers event kind of feel

93
00:04:02,209 --> 00:04:02,509
to them.

94
00:04:02,869 --> 00:04:03,529
So they're amazing.

95
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,890
But as an example, that party, which

96
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:09,112
is quite a known party, sold out in three minutes.

97
00:04:09,992 --> 00:04:13,514
So that's kind of tricky to get tickets to all the parties.

98
00:04:13,734 --> 00:04:15,375
And there are several ways you can do this.

99
00:04:15,415 --> 00:04:17,697
You can check Eventbrite, Facebook.

100
00:04:18,537 --> 00:04:20,578
There are some Google Docs floating around

101
00:04:20,618 --> 00:04:21,299
with all the events.

102
00:04:21,639 --> 00:04:25,241
And one cool thing you can do is go on one of those websites

103
00:04:25,421 --> 00:04:28,483
that keep track of changes on certain websites.

104
00:04:28,523 --> 00:04:30,584
And you can just input the party website,

105
00:04:30,644 --> 00:04:33,886
and you will get a notification whenever the tickets go on sale.

106
00:04:35,131 --> 00:04:35,711
Those are parties.

107
00:04:35,951 --> 00:04:36,712
Next up, prints.

108
00:04:37,412 --> 00:04:38,493
If you're going to showcase your game,

109
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:40,914
you're going to print some marketing materials.

110
00:04:41,334 --> 00:04:43,755
And I'm talking about banners, shirts, business cards,

111
00:04:43,995 --> 00:04:44,316
whatever.

112
00:04:46,096 --> 00:04:48,718
One very important thing to keep in mind is colors.

113
00:04:50,018 --> 00:04:52,740
And just to illustrate this, can you guys

114
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:53,980
tell me what company this is?

115
00:04:55,821 --> 00:04:57,062
Yeah, what about this one?

116
00:04:58,803 --> 00:05:00,143
Yep, and what about this one?

117
00:05:01,813 --> 00:05:02,214
Exactly.

118
00:05:02,234 --> 00:05:03,915
Well, I'm not sure how well the colors show up

119
00:05:03,955 --> 00:05:05,736
on the projector, but you get the idea.

120
00:05:06,076 --> 00:05:07,377
And you might be thinking, oh god,

121
00:05:07,397 --> 00:05:09,758
I have to be this huge company in order to pull this off.

122
00:05:10,179 --> 00:05:10,659
But you don't.

123
00:05:11,439 --> 00:05:14,101
And just as an example, this is TinyBuild.

124
00:05:15,242 --> 00:05:17,403
And the cool thing about them is that they

125
00:05:17,443 --> 00:05:19,444
have this super aggressive orange all over them.

126
00:05:19,765 --> 00:05:21,366
And it's not only in their banners,

127
00:05:21,786 --> 00:05:24,908
it's also in their lanyards and in their business cards

128
00:05:24,928 --> 00:05:25,408
and everywhere.

129
00:05:25,708 --> 00:05:27,870
And it makes them super easily recognizable,

130
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,371
and it's super, super useful.

131
00:05:29,671 --> 00:05:30,151
The same for.

132
00:05:31,392 --> 00:05:32,092
Swedish Game Arena.

133
00:05:32,892 --> 00:05:34,073
Again, it's in their clothes.

134
00:05:34,213 --> 00:05:35,374
It's in their everything.

135
00:05:35,434 --> 00:05:38,355
So when you see a pink person somewhere around the convention,

136
00:05:38,395 --> 00:05:40,236
you know they're working for a Sweden Game Arena.

137
00:05:41,656 --> 00:05:42,337
Roll-up banners.

138
00:05:42,657 --> 00:05:45,198
Now, if you're going to make roll-up banners for your game,

139
00:05:46,073 --> 00:05:49,776
Please, please keep the logos as high as you can.

140
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:52,337
Because when you are at an event,

141
00:05:52,937 --> 00:05:55,559
there's a sea of people around you.

142
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:58,280
And the only thing you can see is from the shoulder up.

143
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:00,522
So anything below that is occluded.

144
00:06:01,122 --> 00:06:02,563
And if your banner looks like this,

145
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:05,325
nobody will remember the name of your game or the logo.

146
00:06:05,585 --> 00:06:06,285
So don't do that.

147
00:06:07,868 --> 00:06:16,820
Flyers. Stop it with the flyers. They don't work. Actually, how many of you got a flyer

148
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:22,348
and then went back home and got it out after folding it nicely and putting it in your pocket

149
00:06:22,688 --> 00:06:24,751
and actually went on the website on that flyer?

150
00:06:26,630 --> 00:06:27,551
Yeah, not a lot of people.

151
00:06:28,792 --> 00:06:29,492
But yeah, they don't work.

152
00:06:29,672 --> 00:06:31,874
Because you see these tables around the event,

153
00:06:32,494 --> 00:06:34,536
and they're not places where you can pick up a flyer from.

154
00:06:34,776 --> 00:06:36,597
It's where you drop off a flyer.

155
00:06:36,717 --> 00:06:38,458
It's where flyers go to die.

156
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:40,720
And if they don't go there, they end up on the floor.

157
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,342
And we've all seen these scenarios at the end of events.

158
00:06:44,583 --> 00:06:47,926
Instead, you can make business card sized flyers.

159
00:06:48,406 --> 00:06:49,467
These are so amazing.

160
00:06:49,888 --> 00:06:52,550
It's exactly like a flyer, but convenient.

161
00:06:53,191 --> 00:06:54,952
And it has all the information you need on it.

162
00:06:55,493 --> 00:06:59,496
For example, for Move or Die, we had the title of the game,

163
00:07:00,097 --> 00:07:02,079
the logo, some bullet points about the game.

164
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:03,720
And on the back, it had a character

165
00:07:03,941 --> 00:07:06,283
and a little description for each character.

166
00:07:06,763 --> 00:07:09,926
So it had this kind of collectible feel to it.

167
00:07:11,394 --> 00:07:12,894
So yeah, those were prints.

168
00:07:13,435 --> 00:07:14,195
Stop it with the flyers.

169
00:07:16,216 --> 00:07:17,416
Next up, adjust your game.

170
00:07:17,516 --> 00:07:18,437
You can be smart about this.

171
00:07:18,457 --> 00:07:20,037
If you're going to showcase your game at a convention,

172
00:07:20,057 --> 00:07:22,778
you can do what we did with Move or Die.

173
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:24,919
And we made a convention mode, which

174
00:07:24,979 --> 00:07:26,940
was easily accessible in the Options menu.

175
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,521
And when you turn it on, it made some changes to the game.

176
00:07:30,367 --> 00:07:31,528
For example, when you play Move or Die,

177
00:07:31,548 --> 00:07:34,409
you can set how long a match can last.

178
00:07:34,929 --> 00:07:37,410
And when Convention Mode is turned on,

179
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:40,451
that option is disabled, and it defaults to five minutes.

180
00:07:41,411 --> 00:07:42,972
So the player doesn't have to worry about that.

181
00:07:44,332 --> 00:07:45,593
Make sure the game runs on its own.

182
00:07:46,313 --> 00:07:49,734
And by this, I mean make it very clear when the demo ended

183
00:07:49,855 --> 00:07:51,395
so the player actually knows when

184
00:07:51,415 --> 00:07:52,215
to put down the controller.

185
00:07:53,776 --> 00:07:57,800
Make sure it auto-restarts, both in-game and both if the game

186
00:07:57,820 --> 00:08:00,542
catches on fire, which was our case several times.

187
00:08:01,263 --> 00:08:02,864
We had a program running in the background,

188
00:08:03,285 --> 00:08:04,546
checking if the game is running.

189
00:08:04,746 --> 00:08:06,548
And if it crashed and it was not running,

190
00:08:06,688 --> 00:08:07,669
it would boot it up again.

191
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,611
And nobody knew that.

192
00:08:09,711 --> 00:08:11,292
It felt like it was a soft restart.

193
00:08:12,193 --> 00:08:14,735
But yeah, if you have a multiplayer game,

194
00:08:14,955 --> 00:08:19,138
fill in empty slots with AI because it's super convenient

195
00:08:19,158 --> 00:08:22,300
to just pick up a controller and jump right in and replace an AI.

196
00:08:23,661 --> 00:08:25,483
And if you have an unlock system,

197
00:08:25,603 --> 00:08:26,743
make sure you unlock everything

198
00:08:27,204 --> 00:08:29,786
because no one will grind for that legendary item

199
00:08:29,806 --> 00:08:31,147
in your game on the show floor.

200
00:08:31,167 --> 00:08:34,309
And if not everything, at least enough to show

201
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:36,431
what the game has going for it.

202
00:08:37,671 --> 00:08:38,112
Idle card.

203
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:42,175
This is another very cool thing that shows up in convention

204
00:08:42,215 --> 00:08:45,238
mode in Move or Die if the game doesn't receive any input

205
00:08:45,278 --> 00:08:46,659
for around a minute or so.

206
00:08:47,219 --> 00:08:48,620
And it's basically a looping video

207
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:52,363
that's a bit more engaging than a very cold menu screen.

208
00:08:52,484 --> 00:08:54,385
So it encourages the player to actually pick up

209
00:08:54,405 --> 00:08:54,825
the controller.

210
00:08:55,829 --> 00:08:58,090
And on top of that, make a safe environment.

211
00:08:58,770 --> 00:09:00,131
When convention mode was turned on,

212
00:09:00,471 --> 00:09:02,993
we don't allow the player to back out too far,

213
00:09:03,053 --> 00:09:06,035
like go in the menu and mess around with the video options

214
00:09:06,115 --> 00:09:08,697
to potentially mess the experience for other players.

215
00:09:09,117 --> 00:09:09,437
So we

216
00:09:10,918 --> 00:09:15,061
make the game, we lock it in the character selection screen.

217
00:09:15,141 --> 00:09:17,402
So it's a much more streamlined experience.

218
00:09:18,783 --> 00:09:20,525
So that's game adjustments.

219
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:21,665
Next up, packing.

220
00:09:22,926 --> 00:09:24,948
You want these things in your luggage

221
00:09:25,568 --> 00:09:27,609
because you will need them.

222
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,511
And if you don't need them, your neighbor will.

223
00:09:30,872 --> 00:09:32,533
And when you don't have them, you'll

224
00:09:32,553 --> 00:09:34,274
be super glad that your neighbor has them.

225
00:09:34,714 --> 00:09:36,996
So please, please be a good indie dev

226
00:09:37,096 --> 00:09:38,557
and have all of these in your luggage.

227
00:09:38,897 --> 00:09:38,997
And.

228
00:09:40,018 --> 00:09:41,859
Most importantly, on top of all of these,

229
00:09:42,279 --> 00:09:45,801
have throat lozenges, because your voice is

230
00:09:45,821 --> 00:09:46,501
the most important thing.

231
00:09:46,541 --> 00:09:48,362
You're supposed to talk about your game.

232
00:09:48,382 --> 00:09:49,142
That's why you're there.

233
00:09:49,443 --> 00:09:51,203
And if you're going to lose your voice in the first day,

234
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:52,584
that won't be fun.

235
00:09:54,005 --> 00:09:54,585
Here's a quick tip.

236
00:09:55,005 --> 00:09:57,166
Throw in an extension cord, because you will need it.

237
00:09:57,927 --> 00:09:59,988
And you're going to become a hero at airports.

238
00:10:00,248 --> 00:10:00,688
So that's cool.

239
00:10:02,549 --> 00:10:02,969
Controls.

240
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:06,652
Now, if possible, try avoiding keyboards,

241
00:10:06,732 --> 00:10:09,273
because keyboards are kind of intimidating.

242
00:10:09,753 --> 00:10:11,915
They have 100 plus keys on them.

243
00:10:12,475 --> 00:10:15,517
And how many keys is your game using?

244
00:10:16,337 --> 00:10:18,379
Probably not more than 10 or so.

245
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,760
So I would advise using a controller.

246
00:10:21,381 --> 00:10:24,743
And if you can do it, you can make one of these things,

247
00:10:25,023 --> 00:10:28,425
which is what the behemoth did for their game Pit People.

248
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:29,726
And it's basically a 360 controller with.

249
00:10:31,487 --> 00:10:32,269
pre-geared buttons.

250
00:10:32,529 --> 00:10:33,451
So it's super engaging.

251
00:10:33,552 --> 00:10:35,115
It encourages you to actually try out the

252
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:35,977
game out of curiosity.

253
00:10:37,536 --> 00:10:39,457
But if you're going to use controllers, go wired.

254
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:42,519
Because you won't have to worry about batteries running out.

255
00:10:43,339 --> 00:10:45,480
You won't have to worry about potential interference

256
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:48,062
with all the other controllers on the venue.

257
00:10:48,742 --> 00:10:51,163
But most importantly, because people still shit.

258
00:10:52,204 --> 00:10:55,025
So yeah, you want one of those, which I'm not

259
00:10:55,045 --> 00:10:55,806
sure where you can find them.

260
00:10:55,846 --> 00:10:58,187
But I'm pretty sure you can find them on eBay and Amazon.

261
00:10:58,947 --> 00:11:01,429
So yeah, it's basically a thing that locks your controller

262
00:11:01,509 --> 00:11:02,009
to your booth.

263
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:03,910
So it's still there the next day.

264
00:11:05,578 --> 00:11:08,439
If you have a mobile game, you can get the same thing

265
00:11:08,479 --> 00:11:10,520
for a phone, basically, or a tablet.

266
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:12,821
Or even better, you can do what Team Meet

267
00:11:12,861 --> 00:11:15,242
did with their new Meat Boy game and just

268
00:11:15,262 --> 00:11:17,984
get a huge touch screen, which is such a better

269
00:11:18,004 --> 00:11:19,604
way to show your game.

270
00:11:20,845 --> 00:11:21,685
And here's another quick tip.

271
00:11:22,779 --> 00:11:24,581
Don't rent screens from the venue,

272
00:11:24,621 --> 00:11:26,924
because they tend to be super, super expensive.

273
00:11:26,944 --> 00:11:29,206
And if you're a small indie dev, you most likely

274
00:11:29,246 --> 00:11:29,987
cannot afford that.

275
00:11:30,127 --> 00:11:32,270
So look for the local rental companies.

276
00:11:32,930 --> 00:11:33,451
They're amazing.

277
00:11:34,792 --> 00:11:35,833
Now, you're at the event.

278
00:11:36,154 --> 00:11:36,734
What do you do first?

279
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:37,976
You build your booth.

280
00:11:38,476 --> 00:11:41,379
And when it comes to building booths,

281
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,301
Height is very important.

282
00:11:44,081 --> 00:11:45,962
This was the Move or Die booth at Gamescom.

283
00:11:46,363 --> 00:11:49,544
And you can see that is Move or Die,

284
00:11:49,564 --> 00:11:51,345
because we had a big banner saying Move or Die.

285
00:11:51,705 --> 00:11:54,347
And next to us, there was a very cool game called Epistory,

286
00:11:55,227 --> 00:11:56,108
because you can see their banner.

287
00:11:56,508 --> 00:11:58,149
But next to them was another cool game.

288
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,971
that I cannot name because I cannot see their banner.

289
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,731
So height is super important.

290
00:12:03,812 --> 00:12:06,893
And that's why these are the things

291
00:12:06,913 --> 00:12:09,734
you see when you first walk into a venue, these huge banners.

292
00:12:09,774 --> 00:12:10,894
And that's why they're on the ceiling,

293
00:12:12,475 --> 00:12:14,636
because height is at a premium.

294
00:12:14,836 --> 00:12:17,617
And the higher you can get your prints, the better.

295
00:12:18,538 --> 00:12:19,698
And here's a weird setup.

296
00:12:19,778 --> 00:12:21,719
I had one of the events where I put a screen.

297
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:24,161
really, really high, and that was super, super cool

298
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:26,684
for our spectators to just watch the game from a distance.

299
00:12:27,945 --> 00:12:29,967
A quick way of doing this, and a cheap one,

300
00:12:30,187 --> 00:12:32,670
is to get balloons that spell out the name of your game.

301
00:12:32,930 --> 00:12:35,012
And you don't have to worry about.

302
00:12:35,892 --> 00:12:38,515
I don't know, getting them too high, because they do that on their own.

303
00:12:40,576 --> 00:12:46,902
Sound is also very important, because you're basically surrounded by super loud companies,

304
00:12:47,082 --> 00:12:50,725
and the reason why you're there is to get players' attention.

305
00:12:51,165 --> 00:12:53,107
You can do this very easily by using sound.

306
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:54,789
You might think that...

307
00:12:57,670 --> 00:13:00,471
The speaker might be too loud when you test it on your own,

308
00:13:00,631 --> 00:13:03,171
but I can assure you it's not loud enough.

309
00:13:03,631 --> 00:13:05,312
Because it's a different thing when you test it on your own

310
00:13:05,352 --> 00:13:07,572
and when you test it with a huge crowd surrounding it,

311
00:13:07,692 --> 00:13:10,213
completely occluding the sound.

312
00:13:11,113 --> 00:13:13,154
But luckily, you can easily fix that

313
00:13:13,214 --> 00:13:15,134
with one of these portable amps that you

314
00:13:15,154 --> 00:13:18,155
can find for quite cheap, and then return them.

315
00:13:20,215 --> 00:13:21,897
This kind of works for multiplayer games,

316
00:13:22,017 --> 00:13:25,240
but if your game relies on, I don't know, narration

317
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:28,303
or very heavily relies on sound, that's

318
00:13:28,323 --> 00:13:30,505
kind of tricky because I would advise staying away

319
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,047
from headphones because it prevents you

320
00:13:33,127 --> 00:13:34,989
from talking to the actual player, which

321
00:13:35,049 --> 00:13:36,050
is something I love doing.

322
00:13:36,811 --> 00:13:38,012
And it's kind of tricky when you end up

323
00:13:38,032 --> 00:13:40,094
in that situation with one cup off the ear

324
00:13:40,154 --> 00:13:42,676
and the other one trying to focus on two sources of audio.

325
00:13:43,437 --> 00:13:44,978
So avoid headphones if possible.

326
00:13:46,139 --> 00:13:48,440
Lights are also very important.

327
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,821
Because when you look at booths at an event,

328
00:13:52,461 --> 00:13:53,202
they're all static.

329
00:13:53,222 --> 00:13:54,062
They're all banners.

330
00:13:54,102 --> 00:13:55,243
They're all static things.

331
00:13:55,423 --> 00:13:57,684
And when you see something flickering in the background,

332
00:13:57,764 --> 00:14:01,045
your eyes subconsciously go there without you realizing.

333
00:14:01,485 --> 00:14:03,226
So this gives you a huge advantage.

334
00:14:03,586 --> 00:14:06,207
These are basically cheap LED Christmas lights

335
00:14:06,447 --> 00:14:07,147
around our banner.

336
00:14:07,808 --> 00:14:09,008
And they're super, super effective.

337
00:14:09,950 --> 00:14:11,412
Also, if you want to look super professional,

338
00:14:11,593 --> 00:14:13,417
get a TV topper, which is basically

339
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,341
a piece of cardboard with your logo on it,

340
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:17,325
and duct tape it to the back of your TV.

341
00:14:17,866 --> 00:14:19,008
Looks super professional.

342
00:14:21,192 --> 00:14:24,695
Buy food before the doors open because you

343
00:14:24,715 --> 00:14:25,515
think you'll have enough time.

344
00:14:26,015 --> 00:14:28,337
You won't have enough time to do this during the event

345
00:14:28,437 --> 00:14:30,879
unless you have a dedicated team and you take shifts

346
00:14:30,999 --> 00:14:32,059
running to grab food.

347
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:36,302
So I advise you do this before the doors open to the public

348
00:14:36,462 --> 00:14:38,143
because it's going to be super useful when you can just

349
00:14:38,543 --> 00:14:40,124
grab a sandwich on the fly.

350
00:14:41,385 --> 00:14:42,146
That's booth building.

351
00:14:42,886 --> 00:14:45,106
Next up, film everything, because it

352
00:14:45,146 --> 00:14:47,867
would be such a waste of time to actually go to an event

353
00:14:47,947 --> 00:14:49,687
and not have anything to show after it.

354
00:14:50,147 --> 00:14:52,468
So what I do is I take shots of the crowd.

355
00:14:53,088 --> 00:14:53,868
I take interviews.

356
00:14:55,429 --> 00:14:58,629
And you can do this very easily with basically recording

357
00:14:58,729 --> 00:15:01,070
audio with your phone and then having a friend

358
00:15:01,430 --> 00:15:02,490
point the camera at you.

359
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,671
And I also have this thing called a reaction cam, which

360
00:15:06,991 --> 00:15:10,872
is basically a webcam that you put on your monitor.

361
00:15:11,512 --> 00:15:15,716
facing the crowd, and you let it record during the entire event.

362
00:15:16,437 --> 00:15:19,059
And you might be thinking that, oh, jeez,

363
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:22,022
I don't want to go through three days' worth of footage

364
00:15:22,422 --> 00:15:23,844
and find the interesting spots.

365
00:15:24,444 --> 00:15:25,125
But here's the cool part.

366
00:15:25,165 --> 00:15:27,767
You don't have to, because assuming that webcam records

367
00:15:27,847 --> 00:15:30,450
audio, you can just see where the peaks are

368
00:15:30,630 --> 00:15:33,552
in the audio track, and those are interesting parts

369
00:15:33,592 --> 00:15:34,013
right there.

370
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:36,955
It's basically somebody yelling or the crowd clapping.

371
00:15:38,357 --> 00:15:40,338
And when you put all of those together,

372
00:15:40,358 --> 00:15:41,780
you end up with something like this,

373
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,283
which is a snippet from the Move or Die trailer.

374
00:15:45,303 --> 00:15:47,985
And I think it's super, super effective

375
00:15:48,025 --> 00:15:50,327
to not only see the gameplay itself,

376
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:52,489
but also how people react to your game.

377
00:15:54,210 --> 00:15:55,391
And I just love seeing this.

378
00:15:55,451 --> 00:15:56,032
It's so cool.

379
00:15:57,352 --> 00:15:58,013
So yeah, filming.

380
00:15:58,253 --> 00:15:59,834
Next up, giveaways.

381
00:16:01,095 --> 00:16:02,976
Basically, you want a lot of people at your booth.

382
00:16:03,176 --> 00:16:05,258
And giveaways do exactly that.

383
00:16:05,378 --> 00:16:08,360
So I'm sure you walked around at an event,

384
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,221
you saw a lot of zombie hands in the air.

385
00:16:10,521 --> 00:16:12,222
That's probably because the company was throwing

386
00:16:12,282 --> 00:16:13,203
free stuff in the crowd.

387
00:16:14,404 --> 00:16:16,305
And it's usually pretty easy to make these things.

388
00:16:16,345 --> 00:16:19,667
You can make anything from plushies, pins, shirts.

389
00:16:20,528 --> 00:16:26,153
And these things are super amazing because they give you this seal of validity.

390
00:16:26,213 --> 00:16:29,957
They make you look super professional, even though you might not be.

391
00:16:30,938 --> 00:16:36,103
Also, you can even just print Steam keys on a business card, and even that is considered

392
00:16:36,123 --> 00:16:37,864
something you can give out for free.

393
00:16:39,441 --> 00:16:42,804
But if you cannot make these, feel free to mail some companies

394
00:16:42,944 --> 00:16:44,366
and tell them that you're going to showcase your game

395
00:16:44,546 --> 00:16:45,687
and that you want to do a giveaway

396
00:16:45,827 --> 00:16:48,430
and they will be more than glad to send you free stuff.

397
00:16:49,110 --> 00:16:49,591
So that's cool.

398
00:16:51,513 --> 00:16:51,753
Quick tip.

399
00:16:52,541 --> 00:16:54,863
Tournaments bring a lot of eyes to your game.

400
00:16:55,664 --> 00:16:57,946
And the cool part about this is that you don't necessarily

401
00:16:58,006 --> 00:16:58,907
have to plan for it.

402
00:16:58,947 --> 00:17:01,109
You can just grab a marker and a piece of cardboard

403
00:17:01,329 --> 00:17:03,071
and write something on it really quickly.

404
00:17:04,792 --> 00:17:10,457
And one cool idea that I saw my friends at Juicy Beast doing

405
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:12,739
is they have this party game.

406
00:17:12,960 --> 00:17:17,223
And they had a thing where they gave out free Steam keys

407
00:17:17,283 --> 00:17:18,304
for every spectator.

408
00:17:18,945 --> 00:17:21,787
if the player won a match against the AI.

409
00:17:22,047 --> 00:17:23,348
It was a very difficult AI.

410
00:17:24,148 --> 00:17:25,789
But the point is, if that happened,

411
00:17:26,229 --> 00:17:29,071
everybody looking at their booth got a free Steam key.

412
00:17:29,972 --> 00:17:32,773
So I shamelessly ripped off this idea out of curiosity

413
00:17:32,913 --> 00:17:34,534
at a small local event.

414
00:17:35,115 --> 00:17:37,816
And basically, this is how it looks when that happens.

415
00:17:38,937 --> 00:17:42,299
And I think this is freaking awesome.

416
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,882
And not only that, this guy was super excited.

417
00:17:49,408 --> 00:17:50,389
But yeah, those are contests.

418
00:17:51,130 --> 00:17:52,031
Next up, spectators.

419
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,334
Spectators are super important because you only

420
00:17:55,394 --> 00:17:57,616
have a limited number of computers and screens

421
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:58,297
that you can use.

422
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,799
And people have to wait until they get

423
00:18:00,839 --> 00:18:02,000
their turn to play your game.

424
00:18:02,341 --> 00:18:05,744
And you have to make sure you can keep them there long enough

425
00:18:06,244 --> 00:18:07,245
so they can try the game.

426
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,968
And that is pretty tricky because spectators

427
00:18:11,088 --> 00:18:13,289
attract more spectators, but they

428
00:18:13,329 --> 00:18:16,130
have a surprisingly short time frame when it comes

429
00:18:16,150 --> 00:18:17,090
to grabbing their attention.

430
00:18:17,711 --> 00:18:19,532
And I was thinking how I can show this

431
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:21,413
in a very interesting way.

432
00:18:21,433 --> 00:18:25,094
So what I did is at an event that I was showcasing

433
00:18:25,134 --> 00:18:27,575
Move or Die at, I just stepped away from my booth,

434
00:18:27,856 --> 00:18:30,377
and I was recording random people walking by my booth.

435
00:18:30,877 --> 00:18:32,538
And then I edited that footage, and I

436
00:18:32,638 --> 00:18:35,139
added a number above their head representing

437
00:18:35,179 --> 00:18:37,340
the number of seconds they were looking at my booth.

438
00:18:38,941 --> 00:18:40,362
And you end up with something like this.

439
00:18:42,104 --> 00:18:45,107
And this took a lot of time to edit.

440
00:18:46,047 --> 00:18:49,510
As you can see, in this case, we're under five seconds.

441
00:18:50,171 --> 00:18:51,792
So that's a very small time frame.

442
00:18:52,733 --> 00:18:53,474
Here's a different one.

443
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:55,095
He was just walking by.

444
00:18:55,135 --> 00:18:55,796
They see my booth.

445
00:18:56,176 --> 00:18:57,437
He was checking his phone a little bit,

446
00:18:59,099 --> 00:19:00,079
looking at the booth a bit more.

447
00:19:06,944 --> 00:19:08,365
And yeah, that's under 10 seconds.

448
00:19:08,625 --> 00:19:09,866
That's 10 seconds.

449
00:19:09,966 --> 00:19:11,627
And this is the last one, and it's my favorite.

450
00:19:12,388 --> 00:19:13,349
Some girls were passing by.

451
00:19:13,389 --> 00:19:14,189
They were looking at the booth,

452
00:19:14,289 --> 00:19:15,870
and I was panning to show the booth,

453
00:19:16,170 --> 00:19:17,571
and then back to them, and they're gone.

454
00:19:18,812 --> 00:19:20,814
And I couldn't even set this up if I wanted to.

455
00:19:20,834 --> 00:19:23,996
So yeah, you have a super short time frame

456
00:19:24,036 --> 00:19:24,756
to get their attention.

457
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,457
And you have to give them something to do.

458
00:19:26,677 --> 00:19:32,321
So what we did is we made these prints of character outlines.

459
00:19:32,701 --> 00:19:35,062
And we encouraged people to draw their own characters.

460
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:38,605
And if they took a photo of it and posted it on social media,

461
00:19:38,665 --> 00:19:41,787
they had a chance of winning a free Steam key for the game.

462
00:19:42,607 --> 00:19:43,448
And people loved it.

463
00:19:44,368 --> 00:19:48,472
And it was such a success that we always run out of prints.

464
00:19:50,373 --> 00:19:52,555
There were so many drawings that we literally

465
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,897
built a wall out of them.

466
00:19:55,637 --> 00:20:00,461
And I could literally wallpaper my entire room with them,

467
00:20:00,581 --> 00:20:01,702
and I would still have some left.

468
00:20:02,103 --> 00:20:03,344
And on top of that, it's really cool

469
00:20:03,364 --> 00:20:06,166
because there were some really, really cool ones.

470
00:20:07,967 --> 00:20:09,429
I would never be able to do this myself.

471
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:13,573
But most importantly, we got the best ones

472
00:20:13,793 --> 00:20:15,614
and we actually added them in the game.

473
00:20:15,915 --> 00:20:19,158
So they became actual playable characters.

474
00:20:19,498 --> 00:20:22,801
And I love having this two-way conversation with the players.

475
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:25,677
So that was it about Spectators.

476
00:20:26,118 --> 00:20:27,058
Next up, Elevator Pitch.

477
00:20:27,979 --> 00:20:31,822
You've heard a lot of tips and suggestions

478
00:20:31,882 --> 00:20:32,803
about Elevator Pitch.

479
00:20:32,883 --> 00:20:34,724
And I won't tell you that, oh, you

480
00:20:34,744 --> 00:20:35,825
have to wake up in the middle of the night

481
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:37,226
knowing how to describe your game.

482
00:20:37,947 --> 00:20:38,527
But what's

483
00:20:38,867 --> 00:20:41,888
Something that not a lot of people mention is that you will

484
00:20:42,068 --> 00:20:43,248
repeat yourself a lot.

485
00:20:43,668 --> 00:20:48,449
And it's perfectly fine, because you optimize that

486
00:20:48,569 --> 00:20:50,810
sentence, that perfect sentence for your game, and

487
00:20:50,830 --> 00:20:51,650
you know it perfectly.

488
00:20:51,970 --> 00:20:53,970
And for you, it feels super weird, because you know it,

489
00:20:54,050 --> 00:20:54,930
and you keep repeating it.

490
00:20:55,210 --> 00:20:57,731
But for the person you're talking to, it's perfectly

491
00:20:58,071 --> 00:20:59,271
normal, because it's the first time

492
00:20:59,311 --> 00:21:00,191
they're ever hearing it.

493
00:21:00,671 --> 00:21:03,932
So you will repeat yourself a lot, and it's perfectly fine.

494
00:21:05,872 --> 00:21:06,773
Let's see, what's next?

495
00:21:06,833 --> 00:21:07,373
Talk to people.

496
00:21:07,753 --> 00:21:08,994
Everybody's as scared as you are,

497
00:21:09,335 --> 00:21:10,976
because we're all game developers.

498
00:21:10,996 --> 00:21:11,877
We're all gamers.

499
00:21:13,318 --> 00:21:16,641
And even better, introduce your friends.

500
00:21:16,721 --> 00:21:18,042
When you hang out with your friends

501
00:21:18,302 --> 00:21:21,165
and you meet somebody new, introduce your friends,

502
00:21:21,245 --> 00:21:22,866
because it makes it so much easier for them.

503
00:21:22,986 --> 00:21:25,168
And you'll be super grateful when a friend of yours

504
00:21:25,228 --> 00:21:25,989
does this for you.

505
00:21:26,809 --> 00:21:28,631
And regarding friends, ditch them.

506
00:21:29,051 --> 00:21:32,114
Because, I mean, specifically in this case,

507
00:21:32,574 --> 00:21:36,456
You are literally in the same building with the best people

508
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:37,616
from this industry.

509
00:21:37,756 --> 00:21:40,378
It would be a waste of time to spend that time

510
00:21:40,438 --> 00:21:43,119
with your friends instead of meeting amazing people.

511
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:45,960
So yeah, don't hang out with your friends.

512
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:46,801
Meet new people.

513
00:21:46,821 --> 00:21:48,281
So yeah, talk.

514
00:21:50,382 --> 00:21:53,364
One quick tip is say goodbye instead of walking off.

515
00:21:54,064 --> 00:21:55,144
That's super, super cool.

516
00:21:57,303 --> 00:21:58,484
So yeah, you're done with the event.

517
00:21:59,584 --> 00:22:00,164
What do you do now?

518
00:22:00,665 --> 00:22:02,605
I would advise you edit your footage

519
00:22:03,286 --> 00:22:05,106
and get everything you recorded and try

520
00:22:05,126 --> 00:22:07,467
to make a coherent video out of it.

521
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,308
You could use it as a trailer, or you

522
00:22:09,328 --> 00:22:11,348
could use it as a short promotional video,

523
00:22:11,428 --> 00:22:12,789
like specifically for that event.

524
00:22:14,409 --> 00:22:15,770
So I do these quite a lot.

525
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:19,291
And yep, that's Japan.

526
00:22:19,871 --> 00:22:21,132
And it's super cool seeing these,

527
00:22:21,172 --> 00:22:24,373
because they're so easier to share than a bajillion photos.

528
00:22:25,954 --> 00:22:27,055
So yeah, edit your footage.

529
00:22:27,215 --> 00:22:28,056
Next up, business cards.

530
00:22:28,096 --> 00:22:29,357
You probably got a lot of them.

531
00:22:29,397 --> 00:22:30,397
You gave out a lot of them.

532
00:22:30,818 --> 00:22:31,618
Make sure you follow up.

533
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:35,441
But I would say wait around three or four days

534
00:22:35,501 --> 00:22:38,203
before you send back emails, because people fly home,

535
00:22:38,283 --> 00:22:39,644
they're busy, they take some time

536
00:22:39,684 --> 00:22:40,965
to get back to your regular schedule.

537
00:22:41,840 --> 00:22:44,120
I think three or four days is the best amount of time.

538
00:22:45,261 --> 00:22:46,561
And write postmortems.

539
00:22:47,001 --> 00:22:50,162
Write about your experience, because it's

540
00:22:50,262 --> 00:22:52,143
very hard to talk about showcasing your game,

541
00:22:53,563 --> 00:22:54,784
because it's hard doing it.

542
00:22:55,024 --> 00:22:58,645
So you probably try to learn more about this

543
00:22:58,705 --> 00:23:00,525
by reading what other developers did.

544
00:23:01,005 --> 00:23:02,746
And writing a postmortem is your way

545
00:23:02,906 --> 00:23:04,286
of giving back to the community.

546
00:23:04,446 --> 00:23:05,467
So please do this.

547
00:23:07,327 --> 00:23:08,668
Don't forget about contest winners,

548
00:23:08,908 --> 00:23:12,631
in case you had contests with winners

549
00:23:13,131 --> 00:23:15,953
announced after the event, because we forgot about that

550
00:23:16,274 --> 00:23:16,874
and it was not fun.

551
00:23:18,775 --> 00:23:19,256
So yeah, that's it.

552
00:23:19,396 --> 00:23:19,716
You're done.

553
00:23:20,497 --> 00:23:21,297
You're done with the event.

554
00:23:22,378 --> 00:23:23,219
Now it's the best part.

555
00:23:23,239 --> 00:23:24,860
You get to check out the sales spike,

556
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:27,482
because you went to an event and you got a shit ton of sales.

557
00:23:28,622 --> 00:23:31,084
except you didn't because it doesn't work like that.

558
00:23:31,164 --> 00:23:34,126
And that's a huge misconception that developers have.

559
00:23:34,786 --> 00:23:36,828
And in order to represent this, I

560
00:23:36,868 --> 00:23:38,389
went to some developer friends.

561
00:23:38,949 --> 00:23:44,533
And I asked them about their sales graphs.

562
00:23:44,553 --> 00:23:45,493
And here's an example.

563
00:23:45,614 --> 00:23:46,414
Here's Brigador.

564
00:23:46,994 --> 00:23:47,895
You see all those spikes?

565
00:23:48,235 --> 00:23:49,196
Those are discounts.

566
00:23:49,916 --> 00:23:51,618
You see PAX East right there in the middle?

567
00:23:52,318 --> 00:23:53,739
It barely made a dent.

568
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,061
This is the graph for Move or Die.

569
00:23:58,152 --> 00:23:59,733
All those spikes, again, discounts.

570
00:24:00,193 --> 00:24:04,737
All those events we went to barely show up on the graph.

571
00:24:05,998 --> 00:24:06,898
Here's Targavalli.

572
00:24:07,339 --> 00:24:10,902
I had to zoom in to see PAX there,

573
00:24:11,322 --> 00:24:13,724
and it was lower than the previous day.

574
00:24:14,444 --> 00:24:15,765
So yeah, here are some more.

575
00:24:15,785 --> 00:24:17,306
You can take photos of these.

576
00:24:17,487 --> 00:24:18,888
You can find them in the vault.

577
00:24:19,648 --> 00:24:23,251
Events don't bring you sales, so please keep this in mind.

578
00:24:24,092 --> 00:24:25,412
But they bring you something better.

579
00:24:26,792 --> 00:24:28,012
And here are some examples.

580
00:24:28,852 --> 00:24:32,013
I went to an event, and then in my hotel,

581
00:24:32,313 --> 00:24:34,873
I ran into James Portnow from Extra Credits.

582
00:24:35,314 --> 00:24:38,154
And then some time passed, and he introduced me

583
00:24:38,274 --> 00:24:40,594
to a publisher that I ended up talking with.

584
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:42,615
Here's another example.

585
00:24:43,235 --> 00:24:46,095
I went to an event, and then I made a very cool Chinese

586
00:24:46,115 --> 00:24:46,555
developer.

587
00:24:46,996 --> 00:24:49,016
And then some time passed, and he helped

588
00:24:49,056 --> 00:24:51,236
me localize my game in Chinese.

589
00:24:53,097 --> 00:24:56,278
I went to an event, and I met a cool dude sitting

590
00:24:56,338 --> 00:24:59,639
on the couch of the hotel lobby.

591
00:25:00,119 --> 00:25:01,880
And it turns out that he was a director

592
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:04,321
for a very cool documentary called Game Loading.

593
00:25:04,801 --> 00:25:07,703
Some time passed, and he ended up visiting me in Romania

594
00:25:08,143 --> 00:25:10,744
so he can record a special segment for his documentary.

595
00:25:11,824 --> 00:25:12,805
And I can keep doing this.

596
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:15,406
I met Northern Lion at an event, and he played my game.

597
00:25:15,446 --> 00:25:17,907
And then some time passed, and he made a video about my game.

598
00:25:18,848 --> 00:25:20,288
And it's the same with Giant Bomb.

599
00:25:20,388 --> 00:25:22,249
They mentioned us on their panel because we

600
00:25:22,289 --> 00:25:23,590
ran into them at an event.

601
00:25:24,250 --> 00:25:26,231
So with all these things in mind,

602
00:25:26,251 --> 00:25:29,813
I want to repeat that events won't get you sales.

603
00:25:30,433 --> 00:25:32,174
They'll get you awesome relationships.

604
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:35,615
So with that in mind, get ready for the next event.

605
00:25:36,496 --> 00:25:36,756
Thank you.

606
00:25:47,123 --> 00:25:48,984
I guess we have time for questions.

607
00:25:49,004 --> 00:25:51,946
I'm not sure how much time I have left.

608
00:25:53,207 --> 00:25:53,887
But yeah, questions.

609
00:25:57,529 --> 00:25:57,769
Hi.

610
00:25:58,049 --> 00:25:58,229
Yes.

611
00:25:58,690 --> 00:25:58,910
Yes.

612
00:25:59,850 --> 00:26:02,032
What's the point of even having a booth

613
00:26:02,272 --> 00:26:06,234
if the whole point is making connections or relationships

614
00:26:06,334 --> 00:26:06,795
with others?

615
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:10,261
So having a booth, first of all, is a great way

616
00:26:10,721 --> 00:26:11,722
getting into an event.

617
00:26:12,082 --> 00:26:15,643
But on top of connections, it gets you

618
00:26:15,823 --> 00:26:20,205
exposure that translates into sales over time.

619
00:26:20,305 --> 00:26:22,086
For example, North of the Line ended up

620
00:26:22,106 --> 00:26:24,547
making a video about Move or Die because he

621
00:26:24,587 --> 00:26:25,888
got to play it at an event.

622
00:26:26,068 --> 00:26:27,789
And it's a different thing when you can go up to a booth

623
00:26:27,829 --> 00:26:29,009
and play the game or play a game.

624
00:26:29,309 --> 00:26:32,912
have me show it on a phone, which is not the same thing.

625
00:26:34,213 --> 00:26:36,134
And another cool thing that I observed

626
00:26:36,214 --> 00:26:38,175
when going to events, for example,

627
00:26:38,195 --> 00:26:40,837
I went to Gamescom several years in a row,

628
00:26:41,017 --> 00:26:44,220
and the first year, people never heard of the game.

629
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:46,221
But then the second year, when I was stepping away

630
00:26:46,261 --> 00:26:48,423
from the booth and blending in into the crowd,

631
00:26:48,443 --> 00:26:50,504
I was hearing people walk by and go like,

632
00:26:50,724 --> 00:26:52,365
oh, I remember that game, that's Move or Die,

633
00:26:52,405 --> 00:26:53,226
we played it last year.

634
00:26:53,746 --> 00:26:57,109
So it gradually builds exposure, so I think it's,

635
00:26:57,709 --> 00:26:59,730
pretty worth it on top of the connections you make.

636
00:27:02,332 --> 00:27:02,552
Yeah.

637
00:27:03,673 --> 00:27:03,733
Hi.

638
00:27:03,813 --> 00:27:05,494
So you mentioned when you have a lot of spectators

639
00:27:05,534 --> 00:27:07,935
or players at your booth, that breeds more.

640
00:27:08,455 --> 00:27:10,937
But it's also my experience that if you have none,

641
00:27:10,957 --> 00:27:13,118
that keeps more away.

642
00:27:13,138 --> 00:27:13,718
Right.

643
00:27:13,758 --> 00:27:15,579
Any tips for getting out of that?

644
00:27:16,892 --> 00:27:21,876
So that's kind of tricky because spectators always have,

645
00:27:21,916 --> 00:27:24,137
so just people walking around always have this thing

646
00:27:24,177 --> 00:27:26,859
where you try to get them to play the game

647
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,641
and they always go like, nah, I'm just watching.

648
00:27:30,402 --> 00:27:32,724
And I mean, the reason why they're there is to play games.

649
00:27:32,904 --> 00:27:34,806
So you have to figure out a way to get them

650
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:36,827
to actually try out your game.

651
00:27:37,768 --> 00:27:39,329
And a very effective way of doing this,

652
00:27:39,469 --> 00:27:42,131
I figured out that is to just hand them the controller

653
00:27:42,211 --> 00:27:43,512
and go like, hey, hold this for a second.

654
00:27:43,673 --> 00:27:44,813
And they just walk away.

655
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:47,055
And I actually did that, and it works.

656
00:27:47,395 --> 00:27:48,096
It's amazing.

657
00:27:48,156 --> 00:27:50,277
Because then they're like, well, might as well try it now.

658
00:27:52,419 --> 00:27:56,041
So yeah, I guess you have to get creative with how you make

659
00:27:56,061 --> 00:27:58,323
your game seem not intimidating.

660
00:27:58,343 --> 00:27:59,744
Thanks.

661
00:28:00,304 --> 00:28:00,564
Thank you.

662
00:28:02,366 --> 00:28:02,926
Any other questions?

663
00:28:08,610 --> 00:28:08,810
Cool.

664
00:28:09,090 --> 00:28:09,791
I guess that's about it.

665
00:28:09,911 --> 00:28:10,531
Thank you very much again.
